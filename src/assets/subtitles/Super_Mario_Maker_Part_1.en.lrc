[00:10.22]Hopefully I'm not low now.
[00:11.68]That's the one scary part.
[00:21.07]You're going to hear an echo in a second.
[00:22.47]I need to listen to it.
[00:26.33]It's my first time streaming from a console.
[00:29.77]I had no idea what the hell I was doing.
[00:31.61]At all.
[00:35.84]You're going to hear an echo in a second.
[00:37.24]I need to listen to it.
[00:41.27]my first time streaming from a console so I had no idea okay that should be good right so I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to like watch chat on my iPad because I can't like turn and look at my screen
[01:14.35]Better?
[01:14.93]Sounds better?
[01:15.31]Can you still hear the game?
[01:18.87]Should be able to, I hope.
[01:19.93]I can probably turn it up a little bit.
[01:33.89]Let's see if I can do it from right here.
[01:36.95]Maybe I can.
[01:45.93]That would be swell if I could do that.
[01:49.43]I guess I... Can I?
[01:59.82]Uh... Hello... Am I... Are we here?
[02:02.92]I guess... I think so.
[02:07.38]Although I don't know.
[02:08.28]Okay.
[02:08.94]Let's just... Let's go.
[02:10.82]You've probably seen enough of this by now.
[02:20.37]Let me just load up the chat.
[02:24.24]I mean, like, fuck.
[02:26.94]Seriously, like, fuck.
[02:31.68]I got an ad on my iPad for Splatoon!
[02:37.94]So this is Super Mario Maker, right?
[02:41.23]In this game, you make Super Mario levels and you play all kinds of cool things from the community!
[02:48.79]I gotta get, like, in a better position here, too.
[02:51.03]What?
[02:52.57]No.
[02:53.31]Looks like someone left this course unfinished.
[02:54.97]It's up to you to complete it.
[02:57.47]Oh, shit.
[02:58.15]I need my other iPad.
[02:59.40]Fuck.
[03:01.76]Alright, hold on.
[03:06.08]I'm hearing myself again.
[03:06.96]I need to put this... Oh, god.
[03:08.56]I have, like, two iPads.
[03:11.00]This was not well planned.
[03:14.53]Where's my stylus?
[03:18.95]Hold on a second, I gotta get my stylus so I can do this.
[03:27.08]Okay.
[03:28.84]So we have to finish this level.
[03:30.58]This is Wii U. This is Mario Maker.
[03:32.68]Cool.
[03:35.50]Well, why do I have two iPads mute?
[03:37.13]It's because I have the Wii U iPad.
[03:39.73]And then I have a regular iPad so I can re-chat.
[03:44.01]I'm just covered in fucking iPads.
[03:47.08]I'm probably like microwaving my penis right now, by the way.
[03:49.70]This is bad.
[03:50.36]Alright, let's do it.
[03:57.32]Let me just turn this chat only.
[04:00.70]Because you can do that on your iPad.
[04:04.08]Chat only.
[04:05.84]Alright, there you are.
[04:07.14]There you are, you beautiful people out there.
[04:10.48]Okay.
[04:12.12]Follow the on-screen guidance and place elements to build.
[04:14.06]Okay, we're going to build.
[04:14.72]Let's just finish it.
[04:17.06]Whoa.
[04:19.94]Okay, this is cool.
[04:22.86]Yeah, that's real cool.
[04:24.16]You can put goombas, too.
[04:28.43]Oh, whoa, you can put like a million goombas.
[04:34.25]Probably shouldn't be doing that.
[04:35.37]Oh, we've got to finish the level.
[04:39.10]So this is where, okay, so it's telling me you gotta put the, oh yeah, just like a regular Mario level, I get you.
[04:44.07]So do bricks.
[04:46.41]Fill it in.
[04:48.57]Just like that popular video game, Minecraft.
[04:52.03]I'm sure you've heard of it at some point.
[04:55.29]And it wants me to put a turtle there?
[04:57.11]Fuck it, put another goomba.
[04:59.03]It can't tell me what to do.
[05:04.30]Yeah.
[05:08.00]You can't tell me what to do.
[05:08.82]Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[05:10.91]I can give it wings.
[05:11.53]Can I give anything wings?
[05:15.63]You can.
[05:15.95]Alright, let's beat the level now.
[05:19.53]How do I say, okay, let's go.
[05:24.90]Let's do it.
[05:25.44]What is this dog?
[05:29.62]That's undo?
[05:30.10]Undo?
[05:37.23]Okay, let's just close this up.
[05:38.83]Let's get out of this tutorial.
[05:40.15]Let's just go.
[05:40.75]Okay.
[05:42.97]Let's do it.
[05:45.55]What more do you want me to do again?
[05:48.64]Alright, let's just follow the instructions so we can get out of here.
[05:54.80]That's it, right?
[05:57.56]There's the goal.
[06:00.35]Erase mode.
[06:01.15]I'm just going through to see what the hell this stuff all does.
[06:06.84]So now, where's the... Where's the I'd like to play this level button?
[06:13.06]There's like the start.
[06:14.04]Oh, that's where you can move the start.
[06:15.11]That's cool.
[06:21.37]I swear, I promise I'll get this.
[06:23.53]This takes me a minute or two.
[06:24.61]Yeah, that's what I did, isn't it?
[06:29.48]Does it want me to put him here?
[06:32.82]Floor.
[06:34.52]Oh, I guess it wants me to do this.
[06:36.80]I think.
[06:38.36]Yeah, okay.
[06:39.76]Give me the erase button.
[06:44.60]I get it.
[06:45.08]I have to do it the way the game wants me to do it.
[06:48.87]I can't be creative with the game yet.
[06:54.39]Okay.
[06:55.49]There we go.
[06:58.13]How's your course looking?
[06:58.85]Why not return to the beginning and give it a trial playthrough?
[07:02.35]Tap the S to go to the start.
[07:04.13]Okay.
[07:05.51]Let's blow through this.
[07:08.94]Can I clear my own course?
[07:10.32]Of course I can.
[07:11.16]See?
[07:14.70]I did that on purpose.
[07:15.80]Let's get them all.
[07:22.26]Oh no, I died on my own tutorial level.
[07:25.80]It's okay.
[07:27.15]Sometimes you die on the tutorial level.
[07:29.59]Doesn't happen very often.
[07:30.83]Jeez, what, what, what, spawning me in a random spot right there?
[07:35.31]I gotta say I'm not that keen on using this big-ass iPad screen to play the game.
[07:40.34]Get my Wii U controller in my hand.
[07:46.12]Okay.
[07:47.72]Now, tap the course button to save your very first- I don't want to save that.
[07:52.34]This level sucks.
[07:58.03]Okay, well, looks like it's going here.
[07:59.93]Okay.
[08:07.63]I'm not allowed to call it that.
[08:13.00]Haha.
[08:23.22]Three new icons.
[08:24.84]Didn't they have this stuff locked behind...
[08:27.96]Some type of 9-day unlock system and then they went back on it or something like that.
[08:33.32]Whatever.
[08:33.64]I can change the game.
[08:37.26]Or day and night underground.
[08:38.48]That's cool.
[08:38.88]I can change the game up here.
[08:41.90]Super Mario Brothers.
[08:43.81]This is the new one.
[08:44.39]This is the one for Wii U, right?
[08:48.55]That's cool.
[08:50.45]And now what does it want me to do?
[08:54.25]Where are we going?
[08:58.68]Oh, rocket ship.
[09:03.09]You now go to the basic tools needed for the course creation.
[09:04.93]Try different combinations to see what you can come up with until you queue the next delivery of new course elements.
[09:12.03]So it just wants me to mess around?
[09:14.66]Well, let's detonate this.
[09:15.50]Let's start over from the beginning.
[09:24.55]Oh, I'm trying to get my... I'm trying to look at my other iPad.
[09:30.01]People set their clocks ahead.
[09:31.99]Is it daylight savings time?
[09:34.35]Alright, what even is this?
[09:35.33]I don't even know what this is.
[09:37.83]Oh, okay.
[09:47.93]That's a real easy level.
[09:53.11]Okay, he wants me to go to the main menu.
[09:54.91]Touch!
[09:58.91]The key to making fun courses is playing lots of courses.
[10:01.49]Sure.
[10:01.69]Okay.
[10:06.89]So this is where I can play other people's levels, right?
[10:08.58]I guess.
[10:14.08]Let's do it.
[10:15.24]Let's see what these people got.
[10:27.53]What did they just take from me?
[10:36.10]Stuff is unlocked by pacing.
[10:39.30]Yeah, Otto almost broke the Wii U. I don't know what it is with my dog, but he's... What the fuck?
[10:45.88]It's gigantic.
[10:47.26]My dog and flies... If there's a fly in the house, he loses his mind.
[10:53.71]To a point where... He just starts ramming into walls and shit.
[10:57.87]He starts crashing into everybody.
[11:01.50]Thanks for the 1-up.
[11:03.68]Did somebody make this level?
[11:05.72]I'm assuming they did.
[11:06.44]What?
[11:11.17]Get out of here.
[11:12.33]But anyway, so... Oh my god, that was cool.
[11:15.95]So there was a fly in the house and he ran into... Long story short, he ran into a bunch of cords and ripped the Wii U off the shelf and it landed on the ground and I thought it broke.
[11:26.21]That's kind of cool.
[11:29.11]See, this person, like, knows what they're doing.
[11:31.82]All of my levels are going to suck.
[11:40.96]He's got doors, too?
[11:41.94]Ugh, cool!
[11:44.88]There's a green door.
[11:46.32]I'm about to fall.
[11:52.17]Yeah.
[11:54.75]Okay, well, that was cool.
[11:55.45]Oh, this is an official Nintendo level.
[12:07.00]I'm just going to go next.
[12:10.68]I'm going to blow through these.
[12:12.28]Let's just go as fast as we can so we can get to the most important thing.
[12:15.44]And that's making a level.
[12:16.42]Because this is Super Mario Maker.
[12:20.16]Not Super Mario World.
[12:22.04]Oh, this one's the different Mario.
[12:27.32]Are we going to... Oh, shit.
[12:28.62]Really?
[12:33.00]Is this it?
[12:34.40]There's a bunch of doors.
[12:36.80]Where's the innovation, Nintendo?
[12:40.54]Can I whack that?
[12:44.96]Oh, if you have a double jump.
[12:51.69]Thought you could jump on the wrenches.
[12:55.17]I was certain you could jump on the wrenches.
[12:56.55]You're going to give me nine tries?
[12:57.95]Alright, let's go.
[12:59.73]Blow through it.
[13:02.99]I'll go this door this time.
[13:18.50]Let's go.
[13:24.59]People are saying at some points it's laggy.
[13:26.27]I don't know.
[13:27.49]Maybe that's something to do with how I'm pulling through the connection.
[13:30.55]Uh-oh.
[13:37.90]The stream is lagging.
[13:40.40]Somebody... Wait, this is the... I already did this one, didn't I?
[13:55.01]Hold on, did that just make a horn?
[13:57.13]Like a clown horn?
[13:58.05]I didn't know you could do like sound effects too, that's cool.
[14:27.85]Might just be a rough patch for my internet.
[14:30.27]It happens sometimes with this, uh... The router I have is kind of a... piece of shit.
[14:38.94]You can record your own voice in these?
[14:42.06]Oh my goodness, we're definitely doing that.
[14:46.42]Watch out for Boo.
[14:47.78]Fuck.
[14:58.39]Oh, no, no.
[14:59.53]I'm just trying to do the rush tactic.
[15:01.11]You know we're still going to do the rush tactic, I think.
[15:05.59]No, we're not.
[15:06.83]Let's just go.
[15:12.69]See ya.
[15:17.68]Generic bird noises.
[15:23.28]Recorded voices only play on local machine, not online.
[15:26.22]That's still kind of cool, though.
[15:30.51]Help.
[15:32.17]Help.
[15:35.31]When does Tip of the Hat starts?
[15:36.57]It's tomorrow.
[15:37.75]Saturday.
[15:38.15]Ooh.
[15:38.85]This is Mario 3.
[15:39.39]That's cool.
[15:43.23]How many different Mario games are in this?
[15:47.71]I did not know.
[15:48.35]I actually did not know that that's what that was.
[15:51.37]I thought that was just a little thing I could jump on.
[15:53.87]And then fire went right up my ass.
[16:04.65]Uh, I gotta ride this I think What uh, what what do I miss in here I gotta hit him like 50 times it'll break No, alright, we did I didn't do something over here then go in this pipe I guess not
[16:44.04]Oh, you can pick these up, can't you?
[16:44.98]I guess I thought you could.
[16:51.22]Yo, you wait for the P block to come over?
[16:53.02]Oh.
[16:58.54]What the fuck am I supposed to... How am I supposed to get that?
[17:00.38]Oh shit, that shoots fireballs too.
[17:08.54]That's good to know.
[17:13.40]A peace which is journey.
[17:14.37]Well, I guess it's in the title.
[17:16.67]Oh, okay.
[17:18.07]I have to knock it up there, so I get it.
[17:20.37]There it is.
[17:26.95]Here it comes.
[17:30.91]Actually, that requires a lot of timing.
[17:36.28]Oh my fucking god.
[17:39.10]I waited for the exact moment where that was going to happen.
[17:43.36]It's gonna be a long night.
[17:45.06]It's gonna be a fucking long night if I'm gonna do shit like that.
[17:56.86]I'm not even gonna watch it.
[17:57.89]Just stay over here.
[18:04.75]Come on.
[18:06.25]Come on, I'm getting antsy.
[18:07.19]Come on, I'm getting antsy.
[18:10.65]Hopefully that gopher doesn't steal it.
[18:15.59]Do I have to go up?
[18:16.93]No, I don't.
[18:20.64]Yeah.
[18:24.20]There we go.
[18:29.11]Yeah, somebody asked about Tip of the Hat.
[18:30.21]Tip of the Hat starts tomorrow at 12, I think.
[18:43.66]This is Mario World.
[18:45.10]I used to love this game.
[18:47.50]This was a fantastic game.
[18:52.24]Okay.
[18:52.50]I'm gonna take it.
[18:57.27]Why would it give me another one?
[18:58.99]There's definitely a reason why it gave me another one.
[19:02.97]See?
[19:04.21]Oh, shit.
[19:17.40]You know, my brain was clicking there for a second.
[19:20.10]I saw the stairs going up, and I'm just like, oh no.
[19:23.54]Shouldn't have done that.
[19:24.42]Fuck.
[19:28.03]Good thing there's an infinite amount of them.
[19:30.47]You don't even need to do that.
[19:32.85]There's no reason to do what I just did.
[19:37.75]See?
[19:38.24]There we go.
[19:40.72]I actually just made that harder for myself.
[19:47.46]There we go.
[19:56.37]Wait for it to open.
[19:58.05]That was annoying.
[20:00.41]Okay.
[20:01.03]Okay.
[20:06.79]Who is screaming?
[20:09.81]Yay.
[20:13.73]Hi-ya.
[20:16.08]That's it.
[20:17.71]Alright, thanks for coming to the stream.
[20:19.59]I just beat Super Mario Maker.
[20:21.75]Game over.
[20:22.51]I won.
[20:29.56]Am I going to make an impossible level?
[20:31.58]No, I'm going to try and make a weird one.
[20:32.98]I don't know about impossible.
[20:34.62]I don't know about impossible.
[20:42.51]Ooh.
[20:45.07]Ooh.
[20:46.75]Something about the aesthetic of Mario 3.
[20:49.71]It's just such a cool-looking game.
[20:52.43]Out of all the Marios, I think it's probably my favorite-looking Mario.
[20:56.94]Just due to how everybody looks cool.
[21:01.16]Oh, wait a minute.
[21:01.58]Can I, uh... Does it still work?
[21:06.20]Didn't this do something in the other game?
[21:11.01]I think I did.
[21:11.41]I think I fucked that one up.
[21:13.79]I was supposed to kick it that way, but these things, like, distracted me.
[21:18.47]There's just so many of them.
[21:20.61]How do you get them to stack like that?
[21:25.52]Whoa!
[21:26.28]That's not... That's weird.
[21:30.18]Let's fly.
[21:32.54]Whoa, that was awesome!
[21:35.18]Ugh, what innovation!
[21:36.82]Seriously, Nintendo, what, like, what innovation?
[21:39.00]Alright, let's fly.
[21:42.52]Here we go.
[21:49.33]Thank you for the one up.
[21:51.37]Is this enough for me to run and fly?
[21:53.71]I hope so.
[21:54.61]Yep.
[21:59.13]No!
[22:00.53]Shit.
[22:01.35]No, it doesn't go anywhere.
[22:02.15]Whatever.
[22:09.46]I believe, no, these are not custom levels.
[22:13.47]These are the Nintendo official sample courses.
[22:19.57]This is the last level here, I think, right?
[22:21.01]At least I hope so.
[22:23.95]I got seven lives.
[22:27.92]Lucky number seven.
[22:28.70]I'll be okay.
[22:37.80]Just don't even stop running.
[22:39.38]Don't stop at anything.
[22:43.22]See?
[22:44.48]You just can't stop moving.
[22:46.04]That's the secret to every Super Mario Brothers.
[22:49.32]Eat shit.
[22:50.44]I just beat that, like, I beat that without problem because I did the don't stop moving tactic.
[23:00.87]The magic flute.
[23:01.61]I remember the magic flute.
[23:02.29]That thing was so cool.
[23:10.25]Sorry, your princess is in another castle.
[23:19.39]What was he saying?
[23:19.89]I stopped paying attention.
[23:23.59]To be continued.
[23:24.67]Please buy Mario Maker 2.
[23:30.13]New courses will become available each time you complete this mode.
[23:32.75]There are lots of fun courses to play, so be sure to come back again soon.
[23:35.58]Okay.
[23:40.04]Well.
[23:42.44]Should I just go back to the main menu?
[23:45.10]Course World.
[23:47.10]Let's do that.
[23:47.60]Let's see some of the cool shit that people have made.
[23:54.15]Comment on used courses.
[23:55.47]Okay.
[23:58.07]Okay, cool.
[23:59.69]That sounds like fun.
[24:04.73]What the hell's going on there?
[24:05.57]Oh, he's doing sit-ups.
[24:10.59]Okay.
[24:11.59]Good to know.
[24:17.62]100 Mario Challenge.
[24:19.78]Courses.
[24:20.52]Makers.
[24:21.26]Let's just go to courses.
[24:23.62]Featured.
[24:25.08]Mr. Chomp's Doghouse.
[24:29.36]I mean, look at that.
[24:30.56]What the hell is going on here?
[24:31.59]Let's do it.
[24:32.17]Mr. Chomp's Doghouse.
[24:32.91]Okay, whatever.
[24:44.17]Yeah, I gotta ease in.
[24:47.65]We're going to take these really slowly because some of these levels are probably extremely difficult.
[24:53.45]Go up if you want to have... Oh, fuck.
[24:58.87]We did it.
[24:59.52]We already died.
[25:00.32]What does that say?
[25:02.04]Go up if you want to... What?
[25:03.64]Go up if you want an easier time?
[25:05.06]There's another way for me to go besides up?
[25:10.74]Oh, no.
[25:11.00]It's right here.
[25:12.80]Okay.
[25:14.53]No, we're going to go to the right.
[25:15.77]We're not going to go up.
[25:22.52]Uh, wait for the... No, go.
[25:26.96]Ooh, that was close.
[25:29.58]That was real close.
[25:30.22]That was an accident, is what that was.
[25:35.84]Yeah!
[25:37.56]Oh, jeez.
[25:40.08]These hammer brothers.
[25:43.97]This is... And fireballs.
[25:54.34]That's going to be hard.
[25:56.00]That's going to be real hard.
[25:56.88]Is there a mushroom over here?
[25:57.70]We're not doing the... I forgot that that was there.
[26:06.39]Alright, so this is like one of the harder levels.
[26:11.85]Where's like the You're Eleven Welcome to Super Mario levels?
[26:19.89]You know, you kind of just have to memorize everything.
[26:21.27]You should be good to go.
[26:22.77]Oh, yeah, like that.
[26:24.25]Like that.
[26:24.61]I should fucking memorize that, too.
[26:29.32]What?
[26:30.98]What am I doing?
[26:31.46]I'm missing the most important tactic of all.
[26:35.18]Are you serious, guys?
[26:38.62]I would have had it if I had gone when I should have gone.
[26:52.65]Oh, fuck every time!
[26:54.45]I keep forgetting that this- that comes right down.
[26:56.70]I need to wait.
[27:04.50]How long is this level?
[27:05.50]It's probably much longer than this, too.
[27:10.13]God.
[27:10.53]Alright, um, so, we're gonna, uh,
[27:23.24]We're gonna do this one more time, and then I'm going to rage quit and play a different one.
[27:32.66]No, watch out.
[27:35.79]Oh, fuck me.
[27:38.81]I'm never going to beat this level.
[27:41.67]If you gave me a thousand dollars to beat this level in the next ten minutes, I don't think it would happen.
[27:45.69]Oh my god, I see I'm rushing it now.
[27:51.35]Yeah, I'm fucking rushing.
[27:53.99]Two more tries.
[27:59.71]Alright, one more try.
[28:01.97]I'm going to go up.
[28:02.83]We'll see if it's an easier time to go up.
[28:04.44]Like he states in the instruction manual.
[28:11.76]This does look easier.
[28:12.94]There's a mushroom.
[28:13.84]Okay.
[28:19.84]That is an easier time.
[28:22.24]Give me this thing.
[28:24.31]I don't care, get me the fuck out of the way.
[28:28.94]Get me out of this level!
[28:30.06]Let me skip the whole level!
[28:32.84]Oh god.
[28:33.56]The clouds are gonna end.
[28:36.30]Where's the entrance?
[28:41.87]Shit, it's a door.
[28:51.31]shit now I gotta do that going through here with the hammer brothers is seriously jeez gonna wait for a good opportunity just stop moving stop this thing for the love of God
[29:17.28]They're all on the ground.
[29:18.02]They're down, down, down.
[29:18.86]Throwing, throwing, throwing.
[29:20.56]He's going to start moving again.
[29:22.46]Oh, fuck.
[29:30.26]We'll do an easy way again.
[29:33.83]Nope.
[29:34.13]You've got to have momentum to do an easy way.
[29:38.53]Like that.
[29:40.25]This time I shouldn't lose the mushroom.
[29:44.71]Because I know what's down here.
[29:49.98]Give me that.
[29:52.16]Oh my fucking god.
[29:53.28]What happened there?
[30:01.64]Okay.
[30:02.52]How do I say I give up and I'd like to play a different course, please?
[30:05.78]Here we go.
[30:09.70]Cool level.
[30:14.05]Alright, what else is there?
[30:16.38]So what does this mean?
[30:17.04]13 out of 44?
[30:18.64]What does that mean?
[30:20.33]I was right at the end too.
[30:26.07]Is this underwater?
[30:28.26]Jump or dead?
[30:29.04]Okay.
[30:34.88]I'm going to do jump or dead.
[30:43.61]This one's called Jump or Dead.
[30:44.75]Okay, well.
[30:45.61]Alright, let me get this fucking iPad off my stomach.
[30:49.91]I have two of these iPads on me.
[30:53.08]It's causing me all kinds of discomfort.
[30:55.72]See, look it.
[30:56.08]I'm moving and shit when I don't want to be.
[31:01.62]Let's see here.
[31:02.78]Is this like Jello?
[31:05.68]I didn't play any of these old Mario, so I don't know what the hell these things are.
[31:08.02]Okay, well.
[31:11.32]That didn't really do much.
[31:17.33]I'm confused already.
[31:20.91]Okay.
[31:23.43]What does that stuff do?
[31:30.33]Alright, so if I can wall jump.
[31:33.62]I think I get it.
[31:34.48]I think you have to just land on that one softly.
[31:38.76]I think.
[31:41.70]Okay, no, you have to bring it with you.
[31:44.42]Holy shit, what the hell is going on?
[31:47.89]This thing's just firing all kinds of power-ups at me?
[31:53.43]Alright, well... Can I jump on their heads?
[31:56.22]Yes, I can.
[32:01.76]Let's just move!
[32:02.34]I got... Wait.
[32:04.45]No, I can have a ball jump.
[32:06.45]Or do I?
[32:07.63]Yeah.
[32:10.87]I have no idea!
[32:11.29]I HAVE NO IDEA!
[32:18.40]At least I know what to do.
[32:22.09]This one, I'll just wait.
[32:23.31]Should I bring this with me?
[32:26.93]I feel like I should just bring it with me.
[32:30.65]Make my life a little easier later.
[32:33.81]I guess I can't bring it with me anymore.
[32:40.15]Get out of here, you giant goombas!
[32:41.73]Oh my god.
[32:47.20]um okay that was weird that was very weird holy dude I'm so bad at this game it's like unbelievable I got it hey look I picked up the item
[33:14.59]Hey, you know those things when I told you about like having to be very, like pay a ton of attention when you're playing a game?
[33:21.57]This is one of those games.
[33:23.05]What the fuck was I thinking?
[33:26.33]I should just like play, I should like just actually make a level.
[33:28.68]That would be more fun than dying over and over again.
[33:31.00]Wait, this is a dick?
[33:41.44]Is that what people are saying?
[33:43.59]Oh, okay.
[33:44.03]Well, maybe it is.
[33:44.59]I'm just gonna wait.
[33:57.30]It just like spits out a ton of things.
[34:06.00]What is going on there?
[34:06.80]Why does it keep doing that?
[34:10.55]Alright, something's going on here.
[34:13.13]Why do I keep going down?
[34:15.86]What the fuck was that?
[34:20.54]Jesus!
[34:28.22]We're gonna go to the little kid ride.
[34:31.74]Where's the kid ride?
[34:36.33]Are there levels specifically designed for fucking old people?
[34:41.56]Let's take a look at the up and coming.
[34:44.80]Wow, look at that one.
[34:47.87]Three course meal.
[34:51.71]Let's check out this one.
[34:57.81]Actually, I'm going to use this.
[35:00.27]Forget about the Wiimote controller.
[35:01.69]I keep doing like ground pounds.
[35:06.94]Okay, that one falls.
[35:09.34]That feels a lot better in my hands now that I'm sitting here playing it.
[35:16.17]I say that now.
[35:16.77]Fuck.
[35:28.82]I have the brick in my hands now.
[35:34.98]Get in there.
[35:50.57]Holy shit, this is fucking terrible.
[35:57.43]I'm so bad at Mario.
[36:03.04]Alright, can I get past, like, the first... Look up there.
[36:04.78]You think I'm gonna get by that shit?
[36:16.36]Ugh.
[36:20.69]Oh, God.
[36:21.39]I can't fucking play this game.
[36:33.58]Alright, I'm gonna sound like a crazy person here.
[36:36.52]And maybe I'm a crazy person.
[36:38.88]But I feel like I have an input delay.
[36:41.76]I really think I do.
[36:44.42]Because when I'm hitting the jump button, it's almost like it's happening, like...
[36:50.31]Maybe like two to three hundred milliseconds later.
[36:52.68]Maybe that's what's happening.
[36:53.50]I'm just gonna tell myself that's what's happening.
[36:56.30]I think it is happening.
[36:57.08]Alright, we're gonna go up.
[37:05.07]Can I like plug this thing in?
[37:06.15]Maybe it's because I'm streaming it or something.
[37:09.31]I have no idea what's going on.
[37:11.37]But gosh darn it!
[37:13.49]Oh, I'm protected.
[37:15.73]That's really cool.
[37:16.60]That's a cool idea.
[37:22.63]I like this way better.
[37:23.35]This one gives you the helmet.
[37:34.33]Oh, dear.
[37:38.36]How do I get through this?
[37:39.10]I guess just wait.
[37:40.86]Just wait.
[37:41.42]They'll all just murder each other.
[37:43.26]That's perfect.
[37:46.54]Okay, come on.
[37:48.88]Get the fuck away from me.
[37:57.99]Hey, look guys, I beat a level.
[38:06.75]Do I sound like I'm like one second behind?
[38:08.40]I do?
[38:09.70]I don't know.
[38:11.48]Maybe that's what's going on.
[38:12.22]I gotta figure that out.
[38:13.58]See what's going on.
[38:15.94]Okay, okay, I'm gonna like, how do I give this like a 10 star rating?
[38:18.96]Like, I beat your level.
[38:20.12]Dude, good, good job.
[38:24.46]How do I say that was cool?
[38:28.78]I don't know.
[38:30.06]View comments?
[38:31.86]There are no comments.
[38:39.47]I guess not.
[38:40.73]I don't want to load up the Miiverse.
[38:45.13]No, I don't want to... Get me back.
[38:48.43]Close the Miiverse.
[39:02.87]You know, let's do... I'm going to make a level.
[39:07.29]Because if I'm having trouble jumping, then... You can't really play Super Mario Bros.
[39:12.49]if you can't jump.
[39:18.15]Where's the stylus?
[39:18.83]What do I do with it?
[39:19.83]I want to make a level.
[39:25.34]I had it sitting here.
[39:29.26]Maybe in one of my tirades, I just threw it
[39:32.85]Did I throw it?
[39:33.37]I don't think I threw it.
[39:34.19]No.
[39:34.41]Why would I have done that?
[39:39.67]Let's go back to the menu.
[39:41.05]I guess I can do it with my hand.
[39:42.99]Let's make a cool course.
[39:58.82]Touch an amiibo to the... I don't have an amiibo.
[40:02.56]Then when Bebo's here... Okay.
[40:08.29]Let's reset this whole thing.
[40:16.91]Alright.
[40:17.59]I don't think I want to do this Mario.
[40:23.14]Let's go... Daytime.
[40:25.10]Is there a way I can extend that too?
[40:30.36]Yeah, there is.
[40:33.64]Alright, this one's going to be called... Mushroom City.
[40:37.80]It's going to be very particular.
[40:40.58]It's going to be very, very difficult.
[40:43.51]You see?
[40:43.81]You start here.
[40:45.39]And here's like the stairs.
[40:49.25]The one with the stair there.
[40:50.35]You need to hit that.
[40:53.91]And inside of that... There's a mushroom in that one.
[41:01.79]And then...
[41:03.59]You get that mushroom.
[41:06.11]And then you go down a little.
[41:08.15]Let's clean this up.
[41:15.33]Let's put that there.
[41:17.63]Put a pipe over here too.
[41:18.85]No, I just want one pipe.
[41:28.55]Can I extend the pipe?
[41:30.88]I should be able to, right?
[41:38.25]You gotta have a Goomba over there.
[41:39.99]That's the very scary enemy that you first encounter.
[41:46.87]There's some bricks down here.
[41:54.13]Then it goes up like that.
[41:57.19]No.
[41:59.60]We're gonna... Go back to this.
[42:04.04]Couple coins.
[42:06.54]Mushroom, because you know, this is Mushroom City.
[42:08.05]You can't have it be Mushroom City without a bunch of mushrooms there.
[42:12.01]And then we got a couple of things there.
[42:13.33]And then it's a long jump.
[42:14.81]Be aware of this long gap, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:17.37]You might not make it.
[42:19.61]No, fuck that.
[42:20.47]Now you might not make it.
[42:23.37]I'm going to have like a broken block.
[42:28.66]You know, just to piss you off.
[42:30.90]A little block there.
[42:31.78]Oh, you put a little broken block there?
[42:35.34]Yeah, fuck you, I did.
[42:38.47]Then we'll go like that.
[42:39.93]Like that.
[42:41.91]Mushroom City.
[42:44.11]Like this.
[42:45.33]Mushroom City, you know, fucking Mushroom City.
[42:47.03]And there you go!
[42:49.69]Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... a Mario Maker level that was made by a seven-year-old.
[42:57.13]If I gave this Mario Maker to... like, my little cousin or something... and I said, hey, make me a level, Junior...
[43:05.78]Okay, this is Mushroom City!
[43:08.85]Very good.
[43:10.03]Very good.
[43:10.63]This is wonderful.
[43:11.89]Let's play it.
[43:12.41]Oh, why did I start here?
[43:17.97]This is not how Mushroom City is supposed to be.
[43:22.59]Did I mess up?
[43:23.45]I messed home on it.
[43:24.11]I messed it up.
[43:26.28]Where's my spawn point?
[43:29.76]Right here, right?
[43:35.57]Oh, like start.
[43:37.83]Yeah, start right here.
[43:39.05]So what the hell is this?
[43:45.41]Alright, it's just where I'm standing from.
[43:47.01]I get it.
[43:47.25]Alright, let's play.
[43:48.69]What do you think was in there?
[43:52.57]Mushroom.
[43:55.41]Yeah, now this is what I'm talking about.
[43:58.35]Now this is like a Mario level I can get behind.
[44:00.75]See, it's just jumping around.
[44:07.29]What is going on with that?
[44:10.49]Whatever.
[44:15.57]We have to expand.
[44:17.01]This is not good enough.
[44:19.74]You know what?
[44:20.14]This is how this is going to work.
[44:23.86]You can't touch this yet.
[44:29.59]Delete some of those.
[44:30.47]Let's go up here.
[44:39.91]This is really cool that you can actually do this.
[44:48.75]Can I even... Is this even going to work?
[44:51.11]Can I like jump up here like this?
[44:53.39]I think you can.
[44:54.07]From there to there.
[45:01.95]This doesn't need to be there.
[45:05.51]New course elements will arrive on Sunday.
[45:09.65]Okay.
[45:13.31]Put a guy here.
[45:14.05]Put a pipe right there.
[45:17.01]There we go.
[45:25.68]Where's the... There it is.
[45:31.88]Move this.
[45:34.80]You go up there.
[45:38.29]Yeah, because that's going to be a hazard.
[45:48.58]Coin right above him.
[45:49.64]You know, the troll, the people that want to play level 8.
[45:51.72]Oh, look at all these coins.
[45:52.72]You're going to get eaten by the thing from Little Shop of Horrors.
[45:56.36]Get a mushroom in there.
[46:05.38]So if they can't get these, they're going to be very disappointed that they can't get those.
[46:11.59]I've got a couple of mushrooms in there.
[46:13.83]A couple of coins.
[46:16.43]Yeah, just a couple of coins.
[46:19.21]This is going to go up.
[46:21.01]How much further up can I go?
[46:21.93]Then you have to fall.
[46:25.84]But the real scary part about falling is you're never going to know what you might run into.
[46:31.68]Alright, let's test it.
[46:37.90]Test it.
[46:44.28]We'll go from up here.
[46:52.22]Thank you.
[46:56.02]Thank you very much.
[47:00.86]Oh, he just... I got a mushroom.
[47:03.24]Nice.
[47:05.18]Oh, fuck.
[47:06.84]I think I might have just...
[47:09.66]Where is he?
[47:10.24]Oh, there he is.
[47:10.62]And we fall... See?
[47:19.50]What a hazard.
[47:20.28]What a hazard.
[47:32.70]Alright.
[47:33.96]I think I understand the basics of how to do this.
[47:36.16]So now let's make a real level.
[47:38.83]Do I have to play through the other shit?
[47:42.83]To unlock the other stuff?
[47:45.57]I'm assuming I do.
[47:46.45]It seemed like there was the other courses to do.
[48:02.51]This is... looks perfect.
[48:08.82]Publish that map.
[48:09.80]That map would get zero stars.
[48:11.48]And people would tell me how much I suck.
[48:17.06]What's the 100 Mario challenge?
[48:18.22]I just want to take a look at it.
[48:20.89]See what it is.
[48:21.29]100 Mario challenge.
[48:34.35]You get 100 lives to clear 8 courses.
[48:36.19]Take on different courses every time you play from makers all around the world.
[48:40.27]Okay.
[48:42.01]Sounds straightforward enough.
[48:44.18]Although they give you 100 lives.
[48:47.34]I don't know.
[48:48.84]You saw how much of a catastrophe the last time I tried to play the more featured levels was.
[48:55.78]Who knows what the hell is going to happen here.
[48:58.38]So these are just random levels from the community?
[49:02.13]That's really, really cool.
[49:11.61]Whoa, what does that mean?
[49:13.95]What is happening right now?
[49:17.06]I can't jump in that?
[49:17.70]I thought you could jump in those.
[49:19.02]Can you?
[49:19.34]Did I miss it or something?
[49:23.12]I thought you could fly around in those things.
[49:27.28]There's got to be something in one of these.
[49:28.46]You wouldn't put this all here.
[49:29.44]Right?
[49:32.58]You wouldn't do all that without something.
[49:35.30]Is that a fireball?
[49:43.72]There's a fireball coming right at me.
[49:49.02]Oh, he shoots it down.
[49:49.82]Okay.
[49:55.78]Oh, whatever.
[49:56.14]We're just gonna skip that.
[49:57.12]This is a big smiley face.
[49:58.20]Yeah, you can go in them.
[50:06.02]Is that Bowser?
[50:06.82]That was Bowser in Bowser Jr.
[50:15.04]If a course is too difficult, you can press on it by touching it.
[50:18.14]Oh, okay.
[50:19.59]It's giving me the you suck, uh, please, uh, don't hurt yourself in Mario.
[50:24.43]Like, don't, don't, like, strain yourself, is what it's saying.
[50:31.48]It's like bumper cars.
[50:34.94]Okay.
[50:40.12]This is impossible to do, somebody said.
[50:41.86]Okay, well, we'll be the impossible.
[50:45.48]The impossible loss.
[50:47.89]Is this save and quit?
[50:49.53]For what?
[50:49.91]Just in case you can't do it anymore?
[50:56.75]Well, for 10 levels, 100 lives, that seems like a lot.
[51:00.88]Holy shit, I thought those were goobers.
[51:02.22]What is happening to my character?
[51:07.72]What?
[51:09.77]How do you even do... How do you figure this shit out?
[51:12.03]When the game's only been up for like a week?
[51:17.37]Get up there.
[51:23.15]What?
[51:23.27]Is there like a beanstalk in one of...
[51:38.44]There you go.
[51:40.64]I was wondering why... That was an awesome level.
[51:46.14]I wish I could give that one two thumbs up.
[51:54.53]Oh boy.
[51:58.91]Get out of my way.
[52:01.78]I feel like I made this level.
[52:09.21]Okay.
[52:11.51]Well.
[52:14.39]That was a pretty good one, too.
[52:17.97]Where were these before?
[52:19.03]I feel like I found the jackpot of dumb, goofy levels that I wanted to find.
[52:36.03]So, I hate the water levels.
[52:41.75]Give me that one up.
[52:42.39]Give me like 98 lives.
[52:43.87]I'm scared to go and get it.
[52:48.36]More important.
[52:49.34]Whatever.
[52:50.00]It didn't even matter.
[52:54.60]These levels of the people just spam the enemies everywhere.
[53:06.80]Is this easy?
[53:07.38]This is easy.
[53:08.22]This is real easy.
[53:09.84]Why would I even go up?
[53:10.70]I'm not going to go up.
[53:11.36]That would be a terrible mistake.
[53:16.51]So, yeah, this is a Mario Maker.
[53:21.59]This is very long.
[53:25.97]Okay, this is kind of scaring me a little bit now.
[53:30.60]What are the cannons for?
[53:31.46]They're just shooting them out?
[53:36.72]Why is this so long?
[53:38.14]Okay, now I understand why those ones that were featured were featured.
[53:46.14]Because people make hallways with spammed monsters.
[53:53.37]Yeah, why would you even go up there?
[54:01.35]Unimpossible.
[54:02.57]Yeah, that was an unimpossible level.
[54:13.27]Still have a hundred lives.
[54:17.37]What do you know, guys?
[54:18.13]Here's another fucking, like, nightmare level.
[54:23.26]I'm not even gonna get it.
[54:24.40]What the... It's hurting my eyes.
[54:26.56]This is giving me... This level's giving me a headache.
[54:34.10]The star's here, too?
[54:36.94]Well, alrighty, then.
[54:41.32]It's just a goomba sitting here.
[54:48.01]Why?
[54:48.75]Why it fucking bounces at the end?
[54:53.58]This probably took the person a long time because every space is a coin.
[55:00.32]Let's just go this way.
[55:05.46]Can I even go anywhere?
[55:06.32]Oh, no.
[55:06.64]Okay, so he got lazy up here.
[55:09.34]There are a few spots where there are not coins.
[55:12.36]I guess I don't need them up there.
[55:14.36]Who needs them up there?
[55:15.16]Did I win?
[55:15.92]This is the end?
[55:21.28]There were three Bowser's It's the star bait got him
[55:45.12]So, random levels, you're probably gonna 90% of the time get weird ones like that.
[55:51.33]This one's different.
[55:54.41]Let's see what the difference is here.
[55:55.63]Are those boos gonna fall on me?
[56:00.43]Those doors, I mean... You gotta have Bowser in your level.
[56:07.26]Like, he's just in here.
[56:11.94]Make sure there's at least... Oh, boy.
[56:15.29]Alright, give him credit for that one.
[56:16.81]That was cool.
[56:17.81]I wish I had any idea how to actually attack Bowser in these games.
[56:29.18]I don't think I know how.
[56:30.04]Oh, that's the trigger buttons.
[56:31.72]Alright.
[56:43.48]I don't know, Star.
[56:46.54]I'm not sure if you can even put checkpoints in them.
[56:53.31]I think you can.
[56:54.61]Maybe in the older Mario games.
[57:07.32]Get inside of the clown guy.
[57:15.50]Make sure to go down and over and up.
[57:18.42]I really enjoyed putting these arrows down.
[57:22.92]Where is this take... Really?
[57:25.68]Really?
[57:26.62]Really?
[57:27.09]No.
[57:28.33]No, hold on.
[57:29.11]No.
[57:29.59]No, what?
[57:31.91]This guy didn't... He made this whole elaborate level for you just to be able to skip the entire thing?
[57:38.67]Look at all this work this guy put in.
[57:42.07]All for seemingly no reason.
[57:47.94]Yeah.
[57:50.38]This is just all for show.
[57:51.58]This is all for you to look at.
[57:55.64]Okay.
[57:57.14]Can I... No, I can't even go down in here.
[58:01.50]Sweet.
[58:02.16]I beat it.
[58:09.58]Goomba torture chamber.
[58:14.81]Well, maybe we can... These are too easy.
[58:20.35]Here we go, final level.
[58:21.21]I only have 100 attempts to beat this last level, guys.
[58:27.74]At least it's a different game.
[58:28.60]Something over there.
[58:34.12]Hey, well, I asked for, like, the easy grandpa levels.
[58:42.35]These are definitely the easy grandpa levels.
[58:48.99]Oh, Bowser's over here.
[58:52.12]That's a very strange Bowser.
[58:54.54]What game is that Bowser from?
[58:59.27]What... What game is this Bowser from?
[59:02.37]I'm like... flabbergasted right now.
[59:06.23]Whatever, I... Oh, you can't go through it.
[59:09.81]Is that like a DS Bowser?
[59:11.13]This is... I can't lose this.
[59:17.49]It just spits these flowers out over and over again.
[59:19.57]I might as well just stand here and just tap as fast as I can.
[59:25.38]I did it!
[59:32.21]So... I beat the 100 Mario challenge.
[59:36.35]What do I get?
[59:36.89]There's no Bowser like that in any game.
[59:44.23]I feel like that's from an RPG DS game or something.
[59:52.50]Can I skip this?
[59:57.54]Yeah, I'll do the normal version.
[59:59.10]That sounds like a better idea.
[60:06.25]Course design.
[60:07.27]A lot of Japanese.
[60:17.32]Most of those levels are made by Japanese.
[60:20.08]That's kind of cool.
[60:21.94]It's worldwide.
[60:22.90]It's worldwide, guys.
[60:25.12]New Mystery Mushroom costume?
[60:31.07]cool alright normal so that's on normal we'll do new game on normal so this one has more levels interesting interesting
[61:03.84]cuckoo land But this is where it actually is this is where it's this is where it's gonna get hard probably maybe Maybe not seems pretty standard These things can fly
[61:33.28]Oh my goodness.
[61:36.50]What a troll.
[61:38.16]Just go over him.
[61:42.24]I knew it.
[61:42.74]I knew it.
[61:43.22]I knew there was going to be something in there.
[61:45.08]Those gigantic ones.
[61:45.94]Can I go up?
[61:53.93]I'm going to go up in a row.
[61:56.41]Rain hell on them from above.
[62:01.49]At least this is like an actual level.
[62:02.71]I'm going to get stuck down there if I go down there, aren't I?
[62:12.34]This one's longer, too.
[62:20.30]And there we go.
[62:33.58]So what, after you do this, you unlock hard?
[62:35.42]Is that how it works?
[62:44.44]I mean, let me listen in.
[62:50.93]I'm listening to my own stream.
[62:56.43]How bad is the delay?
[63:06.12]I thought I had that in the back.
[63:07.32]This is actually somewhat on the more nuanced side.
[63:18.95]I just looked down at the chat and I was just sunk to my death.
[63:21.77]Oh, great.
[63:30.81]Of course I went in the worst one possible.
[63:33.16]Running into like... Oh.
[63:34.76]I was on his head!
[63:35.98]I was right on his head!
[63:36.70]That's baloney.
[63:50.58]Yeah, I thought... It's a one second delay, but I thought I... I thought I fixed that in OBS.
[63:56.39]I guess not, though.
[64:01.89]Get away from me.
[64:05.83]Damn.
[64:07.32]That's just making it worse.
[64:11.36]Watch out for the bullets.
[64:15.86]Actually, don't even... Shouldn't have even gotten that mushroom.
[64:18.20]Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go while you have a second.
[64:20.49]Oh, come on!
[64:25.09]Fuck.
[64:27.81]I have plenty of lives.
[64:38.34]I'm gonna go on the top one this time.
[64:43.66]Fuck, I got too itchy.
[64:56.20]Yeah, because bringing in console footage, it takes like three seconds or so before it actually gets to the computer.
[65:06.57]So you end up having to go in and do all kinds of weird audio delays.
[65:09.73]And I thought I ended up doing it right, but apparently not.
[65:16.01]Oh, boy.
[65:17.33]That's super annoying.
[65:19.13]It just launches you up.
[65:20.05]You can't touch them.
[65:29.88]Alright, I've got to be careful here.
[65:36.39]Ah, I did it again with my hand just like... No, I was looking at chat.
[65:48.11]I shouldn't be doing that.
[65:54.47]I got plenty of lives.
[65:55.25]I'm okay.
[65:55.53]I feel like I'm playing fucking Flappy Bird.
[66:09.41]No, I almost did it again.
[66:16.50]Wow!
[66:19.64]I'm just gonna skip that mushroom entirely.
[66:21.36]The bounce back from that mushroom ends up just launching around like a fucking pinball.
[66:32.41]It's a good idea to get it, but I think if you just try to swim through it, it should be okay.
[66:39.90]Oh, you know what?
[66:40.26]I'll just bait him.
[66:44.07]We'll take it slow.
[66:47.93]There we go.
[66:50.13]Come on, come on over here.
[66:51.25]I love how they split into two.
[66:57.72]Ugh!
[67:07.81]Damn it.
[67:09.49]Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[67:11.31]And here come the bullets.
[67:14.33]I did not know that that hit me.
[67:16.40]I did not... Okay, good to know the hit detection because that was like an inch away from touching me.
[67:22.34]Unfortunately.
[67:25.04]Oh my god.
[67:25.64]Do-do-do-do-do.
[67:42.65]100 Marios.
[67:45.17]100 of them.
[67:55.24]I don't want to touch that mushroom until at least these two are gone.
[68:01.90]Will I actually hit his head?
[68:03.10]I will.
[68:03.52]Okay, good.
[68:09.35]Alright.
[68:10.31]Much better shape than before.
[68:16.48]Dear.
[68:20.54]Watch out for the bullet!
[68:22.58]Watch out for the bullet.
[68:31.24]Oh, they really want to launch you around, huh?
[68:35.64]That is... That's some shit right there.
[68:44.42]Damn.
[68:48.96]Those shoot on a very long delay.
[68:50.68]Oh, come on.
[69:01.65]Get me out of there.
[69:03.25]Ah, fuck you.
[69:08.46]Please!
[69:14.02]Whoa!
[69:15.20]Whoa, I did not know that happened.
[69:16.94]Fuck.
[69:19.13]Can't this level be over?
[69:20.09]This level is hard.
[69:21.19]Where's the checkpoints?
[69:25.81]No, just wait.
[69:27.12]Don't do anything stupid.
[69:28.24]You're already here.
[69:28.92]Those things can go through goddamn walls.
[69:31.48]Come on, come on.
[69:32.40]Move, move.
[69:35.18]Yes.
[69:36.74]Finally.
[69:41.74]Phew.
[69:45.68]Yeah, I wonder if I can... Let's see if I can do it from here.
[69:49.43]Let me see how many milliseconds it is.
[69:51.39]Alright, I'll try something in a minute here.
[70:13.35]Once I go through this, I'll try it again.
[70:15.77]Doing a different tactic.
[70:22.43]Don't know what this item does.
[70:23.45]I didn't play this game.
[70:24.91]So we're going to figure it out right now.
[70:28.07]To me, this looks like a propeller.
[70:31.25]Okay, that's what it does.
[70:40.05]Still floating.
[70:45.27]Where the hell am I?
[70:46.21]Oh, of course.
[70:56.43]I thought I landed on him, but I didn't.
[70:58.59]See, I just tried to go too fast.
[70:59.71]I just tried to rush like crazy.
[71:05.54]I got to the end there.
[71:06.34]I got stuck up top.
[71:07.72]I didn't know who the hell I even was as I blew that one.
[71:09.64]Is there a way just to fall fast with this or no?
[71:17.45]You're just always going to do that?
[71:22.71]That's why it's dangerous to use it.
[71:26.84]Okay.
[71:27.02]I think I can hit this guy when he jumps up.
[71:32.16]Jump up again.
[71:35.50]Maybe he just spawned.
[71:37.18]That's probably what happened.
[71:42.24]Getting too greedy with those jumps.
[71:49.53]See, I was waiting for it to bounce back.
[71:54.17]Holy shit.
[71:55.13]That was... Good thing I got hit.
[72:07.84]Mario time.
[72:09.50]You can do the ground pound.
[72:10.26]Okay, cool.
[72:10.80]Alright.
[72:19.13]Mario 3.
[72:27.82]Cool.
[72:28.12]We have a multi-layered, multi-level.
[72:30.12]That's good.
[72:35.79]Feeling I'm gonna have to utilize those Beanstalk Oh shit, I should have jumped Watch out for the fucking assholes that throw the wrenches.
[72:56.68]Oh, come on.
[72:58.28]Come on now.
[72:59.24]Oh
[73:12.07]Yep.
[73:12.81]Screw you.
[73:19.23]Is that a shoe?
[73:20.99]It is.
[73:21.55]It's like a high heel.
[73:22.35]What else is going on here?
[73:34.38]That might be a mushroom.
[73:36.76]It is, in fact.
[73:38.14]It is a mushroom.
[73:39.34]Well, not a mushroom, but one of these things.
[73:44.90]What is happening here?
[73:45.64]That's... You gotta go there.
[73:49.92]Right when it ends.
[73:51.30]So, right... No.
[74:00.25]Who gives a shit about coins?
[74:01.29]We're trying to, like, beat the level.
[74:04.59]This is a really good one.
[74:07.23]This is a really good... This is a really dangerous one, too, though.
[74:11.34]Oh, damn it.
[74:13.14]I had to go up and around, didn't I?
[74:15.82]No, I didn't.
[74:16.32]What?
[74:16.52]I'm invincible.
[74:23.51]What am I missing here?
[74:25.99]Oh, shit.
[74:26.63]Right there.
[74:31.19]Gotta be getting close to the end.
[74:32.13]Yeah, you can wear those boots.
[74:41.88]Yeah, you can.
[74:42.36]I remember that.
[74:46.34]I will remember that for next time.
[74:48.38]Shit, go.
[74:51.64]The door was right there.
[74:52.88]I should have waited.
[74:53.60]Oh, that one was tough.
[74:58.91]That one was tough.
[75:00.03]That was not simple.
[75:06.25]Alright, get it together here.
[75:07.40]Let's go.
[75:17.86]Who cares about the beanstalk?
[75:19.96]Oh, you need to go on the beanstalk, I think.
[75:29.38]So many bullets.
[75:35.04]Oh, it wasn't up yet.
[75:38.30]Well, that's just too bad.
[75:47.51]You know, it's kind of deceiving.
[75:48.65]The stuff blends in with the wall.
[75:49.77]I think I can go through these sometimes, but I can't.
[75:53.07]Let's take a shoe this time.
[75:54.75]It's going to get me killed.
[75:56.59]Without a doubt.
[75:57.47]Let's go in the shoe.
[76:01.23]This is not a good idea.
[76:02.37]The shoe is a bad idea.
[76:05.10]I already don't like the idea of having this shoe on.
[76:10.12]Can I just crush these things?
[76:11.12]At least I can step on these guys.
[76:18.00]Does it keep me protected?
[76:18.96]Maybe I feel more confident inside the shoe.
[76:28.78]Holy shit.
[76:33.79]Don't throw that at me.
[76:38.49]Get in.
[76:40.91]There's even more.
[76:42.21]There's more to this.
[76:45.04]I don't know what enemy's down there.
[76:46.38]I don't know what to do.
[76:47.28]I don't know how to fight that thing.
[76:48.72]I don't know how to- I don't know what to do.
[76:50.22]Okay, he stuns you.
[76:50.90]He does a stun.
[76:52.52]You have to jump in the air, I'm assuming, right?
[76:56.49]Okay, yeah, I remember these- Holy fucking dog shit in my mouth.
[77:05.93]Okay, we're good.
[77:12.62]Um...
[77:16.04]something ain't right here something's not right here I'm gonna get one of these I can't blow this I cannot blow this don't blow it I blew it
[77:46.03]Fuck it, I blew it.
[77:58.04]I'm like actually upset right now.
[78:00.60]Does it reset?
[78:03.34]Thank God.
[78:03.92]Oh, he resets too.
[78:08.48]Fuck.
[78:09.27]Fuck.
[78:09.67]No.
[78:10.05]No.
[78:11.43]No.
[78:16.05]I'm gonna die, and it's all because I had to blow it.
[78:19.55]I'm just gonna throw him down there.
[78:23.13]That's such diarrhea.
[78:28.48]If I just toss him down there, what happens?
[78:30.32]What just happened to me?
[78:31.46]Go, get him.
[78:33.00]Did I get him?
[78:36.26]No, I didn't.
[78:36.90]You just do it.
[78:37.70]You break it.
[78:41.43]I have 86 seconds.
[78:43.17]Come on, do the thing where you break everything.
[78:45.53]Come on.
[78:46.19]Smash it all up.
[78:54.04]I can't believe that happened.
[78:55.32]Seriously, that's so depressing.
[78:59.52]After all that, that was a good run.
[79:01.52]I actually got through that one.
[79:02.64]That was tough, but... I walked... What a pain in the ass.
[79:14.27]Dude, whoever made this level, props to you.
[79:16.33]This is fucking awesome.
[79:18.54]I gotta make one of these.
[79:19.42]At least I've gotten somewhat used to this weird delay I have.
[79:28.46]It was definitely a terrible idea to do those very difficult levels first.
[79:31.96]Without having played Mario for like five years.
[79:35.65]Shit, give me the shoe.
[79:41.43]Give me this.
[79:44.59]I feel a little bit safer now.
[79:45.97]This time, don't fuck it up.
[79:49.26]Like a dickhead.
[79:57.24]You know what the really cool part about this game really is?
[79:59.72]If you're a fan of Mario games, it's like never-ending content.
[80:03.83]You can play Mario games forever.
[80:15.11]Easy.
[80:15.53]Easy now.
[80:17.23]Easy now.
[80:24.78]Shit.
[80:25.42]Let's go.
[80:27.86]This time, do not screw this up.
[80:36.42]Holy shit.
[80:38.00]What the fuck?
[80:38.87]Oh my god.
[80:39.57]Hit it.
[80:39.79]Did I win?
[80:41.07]I won.
[80:42.77]I won.
[81:12.53]I'm silent now.
[81:13.69]I'm just gonna silently beat this.
[81:20.59]How was I supposed to know that's what was gonna happen?
[81:22.14]I didn't know there was one little tiny little dickhead plant in my way.
[81:27.88]And now I'm getting sloppy.
[81:31.34]I'm just getting a little irritable.
[81:33.26]I'm getting a little sloppy.
[81:35.38]But who gives a fuck?
[81:36.23]Just go!
[81:38.47]Don't even need the shoe.
[81:47.88]Eat my fucking butthole.
[81:50.44]Okay, what the fuck am I talking about?
[81:52.24]Come on, there's gotta be another one.
[81:55.92]Yes, come on.
[81:56.84]One of you has to have one.
[81:57.96]You do.
[81:58.34]Hey, at least I'm completing the levels.
[82:06.94]Alright.
[82:09.97]Give me some credit for that one.
[82:17.54]This one I can't slow down here.
[82:23.67]Now I just go.
[82:27.17]Now that I know that that's there, I essentially can just skip this whole thing.
[82:33.09]Right?
[82:33.37]Like, if I just press this, it'll just go down the tube, right?
[82:35.41]That's what we're doing.
[82:38.15]Go right down the tube.
[82:43.18]You punk, you fucking piece of shit.
[82:45.62]Thank God.
[82:48.89]I don't know what's down here.
[82:49.59]Don't, like... Please don't be a hole.
[82:52.58]It's over.
[82:53.40]I did it.
[83:01.24]Whew.
[83:01.92]That was a good level.
[83:03.19]That was a very good level.
[83:04.67]I commend that guy.
[83:07.81]That was really, really cool.
[83:11.71]Let's keep going.
[83:19.10]What do you say, huh?
[83:19.60]Another one of these regular new Super Mario Brothers Wii.
[83:30.73]Wii U Wii.
[83:36.86]I don't like this one already.
[83:41.04]Don't ask me how I'm alive from that.
[83:42.88]I don't know how I stayed alive.
[83:44.02]I don't have any idea.
[83:49.21]What is this level that you've created?
[83:50.69]No, you don't, don't, no!
[83:58.27]Can I not get out of here?
[83:59.35]This dude has made a level where you just get trapped inside?
[84:04.41]Okay.
[84:13.69]Let's sit here and just pray.
[84:16.86]I'm just going to wait for the chat to tell me.
[84:18.40]I have to press up, down, left, right, and I can smash through.
[84:21.20]Yeah, I just got baited.
[84:24.00]I'm going to have to restart.
[84:33.01]I can't.
[84:33.35]Can I not?
[84:35.85]I don't know.
[84:36.45]I don't think you can crawl.
[84:37.21]I'm too big.
[84:41.54]I'm not going to sit here.
[84:42.16]Let's start over.
[84:43.38]Just whatever.
[84:49.62]I still have 92 lives.
[84:50.94]This is not going as terrible as I thought it was going to go.
[84:55.51]Just be careful.
[84:58.15]Too much, too much air.
[85:01.77]Now that's the mushroom I can probably get, right?
[85:05.51]I go down here and then slowly... Can I make this jump?
[85:10.18]Oh, eat.
[85:11.52]I was trying to do the jump off that.
[85:13.42]Shit.
[85:17.91]You know what?
[85:18.27]I think they're all baits.
[85:20.45]I really do.
[85:21.37]I think every one of these mushrooms is a bait.
[85:23.62]So we're just going to ignore them.
[85:29.74]I just squeezed my eyes closed after that.
[85:36.15]How did I get that the first time?
[85:43.91]That's much safer to do it like that.
[85:47.00]So if I don't get that mushroom, I'll just go over it.
[85:50.40]Should I?
[85:52.50]I can get that one, can't I?
[85:53.46]Or can I not?
[85:56.20]If I get stuck in here, I swear.
[85:57.29]Okay, no, I'm good.
[86:05.79]Alright, let's continue on.
[86:07.73]Not get stuck anywhere.
[86:14.13]This is such a leap of faith.
[86:15.37]It's terrible.
[86:16.69]There's no reason for me to do this.
[86:18.47]No reason.
[86:21.53]It's safe.
[86:25.91]I don't know.
[86:26.39]I don't know.
[86:29.07]How am I supposed to know?
[86:30.25]Okay, I can see.
[86:37.79]How do you make that jump?
[86:41.62]How do you make that jump?
[86:42.58]How do you make that jump?
[86:47.77]Are you even supposed to?
[86:48.57]I feel like you're probably not even supposed to.
[86:54.89]That way is just total, total death.
[86:57.35]I'm not going down.
[86:58.13]What a mistake that would be.
[87:05.49]Spin dodge, probably.
[87:06.51]Yeah, people are saying do the spin dodge thing.
[87:09.03]Yeah, that's definitely it.
[87:16.06]I could just go from up here, can't I?
[87:17.90]What can I do from up here?
[87:20.16]I might just overshoot it.
[87:21.30]I don't know.
[87:27.44]We're okay.
[87:28.48]We're fine.
[87:29.50]That was a huge overshoot, but I'm alright.
[87:39.17]No, you have to go around.
[87:40.51]He did the thing that I did in my terrible shitty level.
[87:47.03]I need to see what's down here.
[87:49.45]I can stand on that.
[87:51.13]But no more, no further to the left.
[87:53.17]Alright, I can just touch the plant.
[87:58.88]Touch the plant pot, I don't care.
[88:04.62]I do have another screen to see comments.
[88:06.12]Unfortunately, it's hard to see it.
[88:08.79]Because... I have to look down on my iPad.
[88:13.41]Because I don't have it really set up that well.
[88:16.71]Unfortunately.
[88:19.95]But I can't yes every so often.
[88:21.25]I am looking down and seeing.
[88:27.33]Almost halfway there.
[88:32.76]I want to do something cool for Mario Maker actual level.
[88:34.88]I feel like that could be fun.
[88:37.56]Oh shit, I lost you.
[88:38.52]What the fuck happened to me?
[88:39.72]I'm literally reading chat.
[88:42.98]This guy Highman made this.
[88:46.20]Ooh, that's what killed me.
[88:47.66]I lost the chat.
[88:48.34]Hold on, I gotta reload the chat.
[88:53.98]There it is.
[88:56.02]There's the chat.
[88:56.87]Alright.
[89:01.79]Let's sit here and contemplate what's going on here.
[89:07.65]Hmm.
[89:08.91]Okay.
[89:10.63]I understand.
[89:14.61]Coolest one so far.
[89:17.27]That was the coolest one so far.
[89:18.55]I don't care how short it was.
[89:19.40]That was really, really cool.
[89:27.30]That was pretty sweet.
[89:30.30]Too hard two.
[89:32.42]Is this one.
[89:33.00]Too hard two.
[89:34.55]So this is too hard one.
[89:36.83]Apparently it's too hard.
[89:46.03]This one's just called Level 1.
[89:47.09]It's a remake of the old classic.
[89:51.25]Classic Level 1.
[89:51.99]Got something hidden in these?
[89:54.71]Something like hidden shit in here?
[89:56.81]No.
[89:58.09]Alright.
[90:02.99]That doesn't work.
[90:03.61]If that doesn't work, your plumbing's all screwed up.
[90:12.17]We're still on normal, right?
[90:14.09]We didn't just trek back to easy for some reason?
[90:21.78]Oh, and I speak so soon.
[90:24.82]Forget it, we're just making the jump.
[90:32.37]Got these flying things.
[90:33.37]Actually, now it just got really, really annoying.
[90:45.50]That one, this one's not even hard.
[90:46.92]I just... I misrepresented where I was going to be falling there.
[90:56.12]It shouldn't have happened.
[90:56.82]It should not have happened.
[91:02.58]Again, we're just going to go with the jump.
[91:04.38]Forget about anything else.
[91:08.81]I didn't want that.
[91:09.45]I didn't want that.
[91:10.07]I didn't want to pick that up.
[91:10.73]I didn't want that.
[91:11.99]I didn't want that.
[91:14.63]I didn't want to... I picked it up anyways, though.
[91:25.60]God, this... The easier level now, this one's giving me the trouble for some reason.
[91:31.55]Just do the jump.
[91:32.35]Don't pick up the thing.
[91:38.70]Wait.
[91:39.10]Be patient.
[91:40.12]Wait.
[91:44.62]Actually, didn't even see him go up.
[91:46.54]That was dumb.
[91:50.44]That was dumb.
[91:52.34]That was real fucking dumb.
[91:56.95]What's the name of this level again?
[91:57.95]Like, High?
[91:58.57]Dude, when you name your level High, it means you just made the level in 10 seconds and you're just testing it.
[92:07.46]I'm having trouble with the fucking test level.
[92:10.14]Can I kill that with this?
[92:11.38]I'm not even going to try because I don't know.
[92:17.75]I'm just fucking jumping over the whole damn thing.
[92:20.75]I'm jumping over the entire thing.
[92:24.87]No bullshit.
[92:25.64]I'm just going to go over the whole thing.
[92:31.40]Nothing in those.
[92:38.42]Get that out of the way.
[92:49.68]Okay.
[92:50.80]I said I was going to do that, but I lied.
[92:55.80]Thank God.
[92:56.45]Oh, fuck.
[93:06.28]My whole body hurts from that.
[93:09.64]My whole body hurts.
[93:14.64]Any more of that, if that kind of straightened, I would have thrown up.
[93:25.04]Do you see how he's spacing these?
[93:26.38]He's spacing them ever so slightly different.
[93:44.00]That was a nice one.
[93:45.40]You almost got me at the end there.
[93:54.86]Is this the go until I throw up stream you mentioned before?
[93:57.74]Could be.
[93:59.94]Watch out, we got these fucking ground pounders.
[94:04.57]You gonna put enemies in my way?
[94:05.63]You gonna think you're gonna fool me with that?
[94:07.19]I'm not easily fooled.
[94:10.41]Okay.
[94:14.44]Thought that was going to hit me.
[94:18.18]Well, that was another one of those levels where you just kind of run forward.
[94:27.23]Run for your life castle.
[94:28.37]Well, that is... Dude, what was that picture of that face?
[94:31.21]What was that big, like, face?
[94:32.53]I don't want to draw a picture like that.
[94:37.01]Don't move.
[94:46.49]You gotta be kidding me.
[94:49.99]Are you kidding me?
[94:50.69]This is... I'm not moving.
[94:53.14]I'm not touching anything.
[94:57.60]Oh my god.
[94:58.42]That was fucking awesome.
[95:04.33]Now that's the type of stuff I like to see.
[95:06.35]That was really cool.
[95:13.01]That was awesome.
[95:28.37]Alright.
[95:28.93]Does it say like a swear word?
[95:30.96]Can you get a hundred?
[95:38.68]I just did.
[95:42.47]Right?
[95:44.61]I don't know what he's asking me.
[95:45.97]I don't know what he's asking me to do.
[95:47.19]We're going up.
[95:54.60]Can I get a hundred what?
[95:55.40]Coins?
[95:57.26]What?
[96:00.10]What kind of one-up mushroom was that?
[96:07.24]He's got something over here.
[96:09.82]Yeah, there is something over here.
[96:11.72]I don't speak that language.
[96:13.40]I don't know what that says.
[96:17.01]What's the secret door over there?
[96:18.29]Hold on.
[96:18.91]There might be more things.
[96:24.09]What an odd level.
[96:25.17]This thing doesn't even shoot.
[96:35.69]Alright, we got a shoe.
[96:38.77]I think I screwed it up.
[96:40.03]I'm pretty sure I had to hit that.
[96:42.25]But, whatever, I got the shoe.
[96:47.84]Well, we'll move over here.
[96:53.74]Ooh.
[96:55.35]Okay.
[96:56.69]What's the point of that?
[96:59.65]It's just gonna be a coin.
[97:01.01]Whatever, let's just go.
[97:09.10]Why?
[97:09.38]I don't... You just put random things in boxes?
[97:15.71]Alright.
[97:17.81]Let's hop, skip, and jump out of here.
[97:22.36]Fall down this hole.
[97:23.30]Let me guess.
[97:28.16]There's gonna be an enemy in here.
[97:30.40]Nope.
[97:30.86]Oh, that was... Oh, yeah.
[97:31.44]I already did that.
[97:32.23]Whatever.
[97:39.49]I actually kind of liked that level.
[97:41.29]It was really, really odd.
[97:43.99]It was just odd.
[97:46.97]Get 100 coins.
[97:48.73]Easy.
[97:52.13]It was pretty easy.
[97:57.27]I don't know.
[97:58.19]That could be some type of warning.
[97:59.89]I don't know what it says.
[98:04.60]I'm going to assume I had to just do that.
[98:10.34]Whoa.
[98:13.12]It's just launching around, hitting everything.
[98:18.26]I should have went with it.
[98:19.11]See, I didn't go with it.
[98:19.87]I didn't go fast enough.
[98:23.01]So now I'm at the mercy of walking very slow.
[98:27.45]Slowly.
[98:41.50]right in my fucking way.
[98:44.34]You have to follow it.
[98:46.87]I didn't know that was going to be right in the way.
[98:48.77]It's still going.
[98:49.33]I can still see it.
[98:54.39]No, no.
[98:55.11]Stop hanging onto the wall, you glue to the wall.
[99:03.24]It's going all over the place.
[99:09.52]Do I just end up at the end?
[99:10.48]I do.
[99:15.59]So, okay, what happened here?
[99:17.45]These levels were difficult, kind of.
[99:19.89]Moderately hard.
[99:20.93]The first, like, four.
[99:22.97]And now we're getting... Hey, watch a bunch of turtles get hit by a shell.
[99:29.10]Where is level 12?
[99:37.90]This looks like it's a level.
[99:45.30]Who needs it?
[99:46.50]Skip the whole thing.
[99:52.01]Three one-ups?
[99:53.03]Does that mean... Oh, boy.
[99:55.35]No.
[99:55.63]It's done.
[99:57.59]I beat it.
[99:57.89]You're wearing your Glue Man shirt?
[100:04.36]Nice.
[100:04.96]Nice.
[100:08.41]Good old Glue Man.
[100:15.20]Yeah, what happened?
[100:15.70]These were... Parkour.
[100:23.14]Am I... Am I Sheik right now?
[100:27.35]Wow!
[100:28.65]I move fast.
[100:32.59]Is that gonna kill me?
[100:33.39]Is that gonna kill me?
[100:34.27]Probably.
[100:36.52]Dear goodness.
[100:37.78]I feel like that's... I feel like I can just make it.
[100:39.38]I think I can just make it.
[100:40.28]I can make it.
[100:40.92]I can just make it.
[100:45.12]I can.
[100:48.84]How do you unlock shit like that?
[100:49.98]See, that's what's cool.
[100:50.74]I want to, like, put Sheik in my level.
[101:03.41]Getting close.
[101:05.41]And then I'm going to try to make a level for real.
[101:09.29]A real.
[101:09.87]This is just keep running.
[101:11.11]The other one told me not to move.
[101:12.19]This one's telling me to move, so I'm just going to move.
[101:16.89]Oh, I just...
[101:32.26]That was so many stars.
[101:33.86]That was too many stars.
[101:46.97]Damn it, I didn't run fast enough.
[101:53.18]Run!
[101:55.32]This time don't overshoot it, just wait for the cloud.
[102:01.18]I thought I missed it.
[102:02.54]In fact, I probably did.
[102:08.87]You get a transfer.
[102:09.93]It's like a relay race.
[102:15.08]What is this here for?
[102:15.82]It's like watching my mom play Mario.
[102:34.46]Getting closer to the last one.
[102:36.40]Second to last level.
[102:37.12]Let's go.
[102:45.48]What was this one called?
[102:46.12]I was looking down at chat.
[102:47.58]Who knows?
[102:52.25]Well, let's go.
[102:59.51]That doesn't hit him.
[103:01.13]It should.
[103:15.83]Okay.
[103:21.39]Huh.
[103:24.49]Interesting.
[103:31.04]Can I not do that?
[103:31.80]Maybe I can go in here?
[103:33.00]I guess not.
[103:36.66]How do I get up there?
[103:43.75]Is it supposed to take that shell or something?
[103:45.23]Or jump on top of it?
[103:51.05]I guess I have to take damage.
[103:53.19]I guess.
[103:55.21]So I don't think this is possible for me to go in here anymore.
[104:00.50]No, I can't go in here anymore.
[104:02.76]I've locked myself out of here.
[104:06.16]So, you know what it's time to do.
[104:10.70]Yeah, I goofed it up.
[104:13.71]I goofed it up.
[104:14.29]First try?
[104:14.81]Is the name of this one?
[104:16.93]Maybe I would have had the first try if I didn't... If I didn't fucking muck that all up.
[104:22.19]If I didn't goop that all up.
[104:29.47]Get out of here.
[104:30.29]Oh, shit.
[104:30.89]I didn't want to do that.
[104:34.75]Come on!
[104:35.49]I don't have time for this.
[104:40.30]That doesn't do anything...
[104:43.56]Can run past that.
[104:46.27]Why did I freak out?
[104:46.99]Why did I just freak the fuck out right there?
[104:49.85]I didn't think I was going to make it.
[104:51.89]For some strange reason.
[105:04.36]It's the last level.
[105:06.48]And hopefully I unlock some more stuff.
[105:13.08]the final level.
[105:15.26]Very cool.
[105:22.24]What the hell is this mess of a level?
[105:29.07]I was just taking that all in.
[105:31.41]I was taking that in.
[105:32.11]Oh, it's one of these.
[105:39.83]The platform moves.
[105:43.50]What a mess.
[105:44.38]What a mess.
[105:46.64]I... Whoa.
[105:49.42]Okay, you're safe as long as you don't do that.
[105:51.14]And here comes Bowser.
[105:55.45]They're all locked up there.
[105:58.93]100 man Mario challenge of normal has been completed.
[106:01.91]Alright, it's time to make one.
[106:13.69]I finished it.
[106:17.09]I have 94 more tries to beat that.
[106:19.21]Yeah, I know.
[106:29.28]Okay, let me see the credits.
[106:31.64]Oh, remember that one?
[106:32.48]Hey, do you guys remember that one?
[106:33.78]That one was cool.
[106:34.44]Remember that one?
[106:35.18]Hey, do you guys remember that one?
[106:36.38]I remember level one.
[106:39.20]Hey, remember Run for Your Life Castle where you had to run real fast?
[106:41.76]Oh my god, I remember that one.
[106:44.65]Remember parkour chic?
[106:46.81]Oh, that was so cool.
[106:56.36]Mystery mushroom.
[107:05.20]Now what does that mean?
[107:06.92]Do I get some new stuff?
[107:08.78]You've unlocked expert mode.
[107:13.48]Expert mode, huh?
[107:17.80]Okay, so I guess I'll just... Hold on.
[107:23.59]Let's do this.
[107:24.69]Let's do this.
[107:25.83]Give me a second.
[107:26.79]Give me one second.
[107:36.41]Do you want me to do expert mode and lose and be sad?
[107:42.66]Or should I try and actually really make a level?
[107:45.80]I'm going to do a little strawpolly.
[107:50.72]I know what you guys are gonna pick.
[107:55.82]I know, I already know it.
[108:00.89]But just for the sake of it, doing it.
[108:21.08]see what happens okay guys go ahead and vote vote vote now take you actually it's it's bad that's 5050 I'm very surprised
[108:56.62]This is as neck and neck as I've ever seen something like this.
[109:07.56]Should I hate myself and play expert and not do it and not win?
[109:13.03]Or should we make a fun level?
[109:14.15]Please pick me.
[109:28.43]Let me have some fun Expert is winning.
[109:42.80]It's very very close Expert is so lame
[110:01.57]Well, the votes are in.
[110:04.64]Alright, how about this?
[110:08.40]I'll do expert until I get down to, like, 60 lives.
[110:12.42]If I get down to, like, no, we'll say 70.
[110:15.10]If I get down to 70 lives in the first, like, two levels, I'm just going to make a level.
[110:23.23]I'm not going to lose my mind tonight.
[110:31.06]He's just gonna make levels that make himself feel good.
[110:33.62]Okay.
[110:37.20]Well, that's it.
[110:38.60]52 to 48.
[110:38.88]That was very close, though.
[110:40.62]Very close.
[110:43.68]Okay.
[110:44.92]New game.
[110:46.06]Make sure expert is picked.
[110:48.50]Let's go.
[110:49.00]This is gonna suck.
[110:56.10]I was getting like mad in the beginning because dude in the first like 15 minutes of this stream I was playing very difficult levels at least in my opinion and I was I was not I was getting not happy at all now I'm gonna do that again sure I was told to run
[111:25.39]So I believe that... I'm not sure what's going to happen here, but maybe I should just follow it.
[111:34.32]Just run, right?
[111:38.12]I didn't just run.
[111:41.79]I held up.
[111:48.07]I didn't just run.
[111:51.87]I could have jumped over that, possibly, too.
[112:01.42]Holy shit!
[112:02.90]What?!
[112:05.62]What?
[112:06.58]What?
[112:09.16]That was a wall of... Bowser's... Oh, just kill me now.
[112:19.74]I might get there again, but... But... Yeah, I've only died like three... Okay, that just screwed me... What the fuck?
[112:28.80]You're gonna drop down like a drop down on me when I'm trying to run through with a run to just run level?
[112:35.87]That held me up for a quarter of a second.
[112:37.41]That wouldn't have happened.
[112:39.73]Whatever.
[112:40.19]Just run.
[112:43.81]But if you just run... I think I actually do have to make this thing... Nope.
[112:49.44]I fucked it up.
[112:51.40]We're not just running.
[112:52.78]We are not just running.
[112:54.06]Just run, huh?
[112:55.70]What's the skeleton thing there for then?
[112:58.27]What do you got a skeleton for?
[112:59.61]You want me just to run?
[113:02.73]Wait till these things are all dead and I'm just gonna go down here and just start... This star!
[113:09.21]This star right there!
[113:09.85]There's a star!
[113:10.47]There's a star!
[113:10.81]Give me the star!
[113:13.90]Fuck!
[113:14.56]No!
[113:15.04]Okay, I'm gonna do that.
[113:16.20]Same strategy.
[113:18.92]Same strategy.
[113:20.26]I already screwed it all up.
[113:22.20]It's over already.
[113:23.32]Maybe not.
[113:24.34]Yeah, I...
[113:29.82]That star down there?
[113:30.68]I have to get that.
[113:40.02]Yeah.
[113:40.76]That is the strategy.
[113:41.68]That's the strategy I'm going with.
[113:43.30]I'm going to stick to it.
[113:45.43]Wait for all these idiots to go.
[113:46.79]I forget which one was it.
[113:49.13]To not have a bunch of unnecessary enemies.
[113:50.77]I believe it was this one.
[113:56.87]So then after this I can just run.
[113:59.85]Okay, it's this one.
[114:01.43]Nope, it's this one.
[114:02.51]Yep.
[114:09.14]There's a spring!
[114:09.62]There's a spring!
[114:10.12]Chill out.
[114:11.10]Oh, okay.
[114:11.52]I'm good.
[114:21.71]Okay, good.
[114:25.19]I thought that just, like... I thought that just killed me at the end.
[114:33.41]That was good.
[114:35.17]That was a good one.
[114:41.69]Blade jumper.
[114:44.84]I love Mario 3.
[114:46.14]Oh, Mario 3, cool!
[114:47.84]Just run.
[114:55.48]How do you even know that you can get that to happen, is my question.
[114:58.42]That's crazy.
[115:03.92]People are smart.
[115:10.93]Okay.
[115:11.39]Easy.
[115:11.97]Easy.
[115:12.61]I said easy!
[115:13.23]I told you to be easy!
[115:14.17]I told you to be easy and you freaked out.
[115:16.95]That was so... That was so easy.
[115:18.93]That was the easiest thing of that whole level.
[115:27.96]Get out of here.
[115:30.56]Yeah.
[115:31.74]And your little dog, too.
[115:36.45]Fuck it, just jump over it.
[115:37.39]Fuck, who cares?
[115:38.41]Jump over the whole thing.
[115:42.56]You're overcomplicating things for yourself.
[115:45.60]That's pretty usual.
[115:54.47]See?
[115:55.91]There was no reason to do that.
[115:58.99]I don't believe this.
[116:00.07]I don't believe it.
[116:00.53]I don't think this is real.
[116:01.65]I think it's trying to screw with me.
[116:04.51]Maybe not.
[116:10.87]Too much thinking.
[116:14.57]Then I go right through.
[116:17.54]I have a lot of trouble with those.
[116:19.30]Because you can't keep moving.
[116:21.52]You have to just go straight up.
[116:25.20]I got it this time.
[116:33.05]Oh.
[116:38.49]You can skip levels.
[116:40.43]No, we're not doing that.
[116:41.35]I'm not skipping levels.
[116:47.94]Don't drive angry.
[116:49.04]Never drive angry.
[116:50.56]And that's what I'm doing right now.
[116:52.67]I'm driving angry.
[116:54.71]Just take a deep breath.
[116:57.61]Okay, we're good.
[116:58.73]Move.
[117:08.31]Fucking driving angry.
[117:09.11]Don't drive angry.
[117:15.63]Not like it matters anyways.
[117:21.04]This one.
[117:21.84]Just go.
[117:22.34]Just do it.
[117:25.34]You see what I'm talking about?
[117:26.28]You see what I'm talking about?
[117:27.12]Like you just like... When you land on it.
[117:29.73]Instead of just... I can feel...
[117:36.68]I can feel my face is heating up.
[117:40.60]You know when you feel your face just heating up and you're just fuming?
[117:46.36]Somebody needs to put a fire extinguisher into my face.
[117:49.87]Because it's fucking flaming right now.
[117:54.45]Get up.
[117:59.11]Is there something down there?
[118:03.16]Let me look down here.
[118:04.66]No.
[118:05.48]Doesn't look like it.
[118:06.24]Maybe there is.
[118:06.74]I guess not.
[118:09.66]Whatever.
[118:17.87]That was a tried and true strategy.
[118:20.67]No, no, no.
[118:21.59]No more talking.
[118:22.27]No more excuses.
[118:28.43]No more excuses.
[118:31.10]We just got so ridiculously, incredibly lucky right there.
[118:36.02]Words can't even describe, so let's capitalize on it.
[118:37.96]It's like, you know, sometimes, why does that just not work sometimes?
[118:53.26]Like that.
[118:55.68]When we get, it's, inside this tube is where it gets really, really annoying.
[119:13.40]I thought that was the end.
[119:14.46]I thought that was the end.
[119:15.46]I thought that was the end.
[119:16.46]I was desperately trying to find the end there.
[119:20.68]You can't be serious.
[119:24.00]Don't do that.
[119:25.00]Right when I'm near the end.
[119:34.08]Wow!
[119:34.80]There's more.
[119:36.50]There's even more to this fucking shitshow.
[119:41.31]Thank goodness.
[119:47.72]They always try to screw you at the end.
[119:50.92]I knew it.
[119:52.30]See, there was a possibility that I was just going to run straight over there.
[119:58.24]There was an opportunity for me just to walk right off.
[120:04.26]That was a good level.
[120:04.82]That was cool.
[120:08.42]Okay.
[120:09.32]What did I say?
[120:09.84]Like 60 or like 70 lives?
[120:14.16]Spin jump.
[120:19.37]Okay, spin jump.
[120:25.12]I'm assuming you gotta spin jump the whole way.
[120:30.92]You see how he perfectly lined that up to get hit right there?
[120:35.54]Don't ask me how I survived that.
[120:39.17]What?
[120:39.65]What?
[120:39.91]Oh my god, jump.
[120:42.21]There's paper airplanes everywhere too.
[120:51.80]I'll give you a spin jump.
[120:53.42]I almost just didn't do it right there.
[121:02.39]There we go.
[121:05.41]Gotta beat these.
[121:06.83]Can I jump on them?
[121:08.71]Yes, you can.
[121:14.85]Just wait for these.
[121:19.29]Get this spindy little head.
[121:20.31]And that's the end.
[121:28.93]Yikes.
[121:31.05]Yikes.
[121:33.52]I think I'm gonna do it.
[121:37.72]Look at this guy.
[121:39.30]Don't like it.
[121:40.86]Alright, well.
[121:46.30]His opinion was heard.
[121:58.70]Hold on just a second.
[121:59.62]I could probably just do this real quick.
[122:13.35]I think I just killed it.
[122:18.89]Did I?
[122:19.16]Did I kill it?
[122:25.68]No, I think we're still here, right?
[122:30.08]Yeah, we're here.
[122:33.60]Okay.
[122:37.80]Oh, no, I don't want to comment.
[122:43.98]Let's go.
[122:45.56]I don't know.
[122:45.88]What was the name of this one?
[122:47.37]Epic Ghost House.
[122:54.95]Let me get a feel for this one.
[123:01.65]That's what's going to happen?
[123:02.73]I feel like there's another one.
[123:07.67]How else would I be able to get up here?
[123:14.71]Did I miss something?
[123:15.69]When I was looking at stuff?
[123:17.22]I feel like I missed something.
[123:23.80]Maybe something flew by.
[123:31.40]I knew it.
[123:31.86]I knew it.
[123:32.36]Of course.
[123:34.22]Of course there's gonna be that.
[123:39.10]That's as far as it goes.
[123:41.60]What a dumb idea.
[123:42.28]What a fucking idiot.
[123:44.77]Like, what a fucking dumbass.
[123:48.07]Why would I- Why would I do something like that?
[123:50.19]I just- I just jumped off the edge in an unknown level.
[124:06.06]Epic ghost house?
[124:07.12]More like hidden blocks are going to kill you.
[124:10.08]Oh my god.
[124:17.42]Well, don't go there.
[124:18.36]No, it's over here, right?
[124:24.75]I'm gonna hit it again.
[124:25.41]There it is.
[124:29.75]No!
[124:30.85]Where is it?
[124:32.93]Look at how...
[124:35.14]Now I know.
[124:35.60]Now I know.
[124:36.08]Now I know.
[124:38.24]Now I know what's going on.
[124:39.16]I'll be okay.
[124:41.32]I understand now.
[124:45.79]Oh, I get it.
[124:48.19]It's not that one.
[124:49.21]It's right here.
[124:49.85]It took me like 75 years to figure that out.
[124:55.35]Now don't do that.
[125:00.83]Okay.
[125:02.21]I was certain that I was dead there.
[125:07.82]Can I get out of here?
[125:10.20]Yeah, I can.
[125:11.30]Shit, this thing goes so fast.
[125:14.74]I don't know.
[125:17.04]I'm just gonna do this.
[125:18.14]I'm scared.
[125:18.38]I don't know what's going on, Mom.
[125:22.89]How?
[125:23.35]Oh shit, I missed it.
[125:23.95]I missed the boss.
[125:24.97]I just missed the boss.
[125:31.89]That is crazy.
[125:34.75]That is crazy.
[125:36.07]You just have to get lucky.
[125:38.45]You just have to get lucky and hope to God that you can make it through that.
[126:02.42]I hit it again.
[126:02.98]I hit the... Now I'm just... Now I'm getting angry again.
[126:06.37]I'm starting to get not happy again.
[126:13.57]There's got to be a rhyme to that, right?
[126:17.36]There's got to be a rhyme or reason to what's going on there.
[126:19.22]I just got to figure it out.
[126:21.22]Please disappear.
[126:21.88]Thank God.
[126:26.44]That comes down.
[126:31.29]It comes down.
[126:34.23]That comes down right there.
[126:37.40]You know, there really is, I was gonna say slow down a little bit, but no, you just, you're just gonna take that ride and hope you can jump over the stuff.
[126:46.09]I don't know how to, I don't, I don't know how to avoid that.
[126:56.90]Do you have to jump, I think you have to jump over it, huh?
[127:03.47]I'm assuming you gotta just jump over that, because it'll just- that'll be triggered every single time, and you'll get hit by it every time.
[127:17.12]Well, trying to rush it.
[127:24.25]I tried to jump.
[127:24.73]I tried to jump.
[127:25.57]Did you hit the button?
[127:27.05]You heard the button.
[127:27.49]You had to have heard the button.
[127:28.49]I tried to jump, and my guy crouched.
[127:34.86]Or I have to, like, sit in a certain spot on it.
[127:36.54]It'd be nice if I could actually get back to that part.
[127:40.76]Rather than just, like, hold my eyes closed like Mario was doing.
[127:47.89]Let's get right on the front.
[127:50.73]Oh boy, that didn't work.
[127:53.77]No.
[127:54.91]Ugh, you can't hit that guy.
[128:04.00]Shit.
[128:05.02]This is a pain in the ass.
[128:18.31]Okay.
[128:21.03]So if I just walk on it... Nope.
[128:27.22]Oh, it's just going too fast.
[128:29.96]It's going too fast for my fucking brain to handle this.
[128:35.43]I have to jump on it and then run underneath that thing.
[128:38.83]And then not get hit by the giant flame wake at the end of it.
[128:42.77]And then jump over the guy's head?
[128:44.37]I don't even know.
[128:46.49]I was not... Now I'm just being a fucking dummy.
[128:56.24]Only a few more tries of this.
[128:58.58]And... You know, it's just all repetition.
[129:02.94]After doing this like 300 times, I'll probably figure it all out.
[129:13.30]Start at the end.
[129:15.06]Walk forward.
[129:16.16]I didn't do it fast enough.
[129:20.48]What the hell?
[129:21.25]How did he hit me?
[129:25.27]I'm going to take this one down to 70 and I'm just skipping it.
[129:29.93]You can call me the skipper.
[129:34.94]This one is crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy.
[129:45.69]Almost.
[129:50.31]Again, it's just trial and error.
[129:51.58]There was no way for me to know that that was going to fall.
[129:54.82]There was absolutely no conceivable way I would have known that that thing was going to fall.
[129:59.66]Unless I died by it like I just did.
[130:08.81]Like, that was just... Somebody just threw a fucking beer in my face.
[130:13.19]No, that is not a good idea.
[130:17.93]At least I might have this down.
[130:19.17]At least this part.
[130:21.33]Okay, I'll take the hit here.
[130:24.64]Here it comes.
[130:26.58]Oh, shit!
[130:27.26]Ugh!
[130:35.83]What did I do there?
[130:36.63]What did I do there?
[130:40.73]And I just flipped out.
[130:41.97]I just got too... I got too... Might be okay.
[130:47.34]I still might be alright.
[130:52.86]Screw you, Boo.
[131:04.78]Oh my god, I had the moment... I said 70.
[131:13.82]Once it gets down to 70, that's when I throw the skip into this one.
[131:20.47]At least I figured out this first part.
[131:31.80]Although, it's so hard to even determine when to leave.
[131:36.09]I'm stuck here.
[131:37.13]I'm stuck here forever.
[131:40.75]All I can potentially do is, like... I don't even know.
[131:44.05]I'm not even sure.
[131:45.69]I'm just gonna hit this button.
[131:47.31]Just go.
[131:47.61]Nope.
[131:50.71]If there was a flower down there, I could possibly have gotten... This is excruciating.
[132:05.37]At least I'm not getting hit by the first block guy.
[132:12.53]Okay, good.
[132:13.41]Shit, shit, shit, shit.
[132:21.32]I'm going to try to get this.
[132:23.78]It's totally worth it.
[132:25.42]Or is it?
[132:27.64]I think I'm going to trigger the fall.
[132:31.04]I kicked it.
[132:31.92]I just kicked it.
[132:32.60]I kicked the damn thing.
[132:42.53]Well, this is, here we are.
[132:47.23]Here we are.
[132:47.75]And of course, of course, the creator of this level made sure that if you try to rush this beginning, you're just totally, 100% going to screw yourself.
[133:08.97]He got hit by the dumb easy thing.
[133:10.59]That's gonna be it.
[133:12.33]This one's done.
[133:13.27]Yep.
[133:17.79]I'm gonna... You know what?
[133:18.43]I'm gonna try... I'll try the door.
[133:20.69]I'll try the door.
[133:23.27]If the door... If the door puts me at the beginning of the level, I'm going to skip this level.
[133:27.59]I'm gonna just pull up the start menu and say, get me out of here.
[133:43.29]Whoops.
[133:46.06]Going in the door.
[133:50.06]Ooh.
[133:50.54]Oh, boy.
[133:51.82]Oh, boy.
[133:52.40]Oh, boy.
[133:56.28]Stay with me.
[133:56.92]Stay with me.
[133:57.86]Stay... What?
[134:04.19]What the fuck?
[134:04.67]No.
[134:05.19]Touch it.
[134:06.41]I did it.
[134:11.51]I did it.
[134:13.29]Thank God.
[134:19.59]Got it.
[134:19.85]Yeah, I only wasted like 20 lives on that one.
[134:31.43]This one's called Boing Boing.
[134:37.94]Interesting.
[134:39.28]I had to go way before that I currently did.
[134:42.08]Because now I'm just at the mercy of this.
[134:49.43]Okay.
[134:52.39]Go.
[134:52.85]I just gotta run.
[134:53.87]Otherwise you just get overwhelmed.
[134:54.87]Actually, I might be able to get the mushroom before they all get over here.
[135:00.97]Yeah, I can.
[135:01.89]I definitely can.
[135:02.57]I just wasn't quick enough.
[135:04.53]I didn't use my quick draw showdown skills.
[135:10.21]I would have had it if I wasn't such a fucking dumbass!
[135:20.53]Got it.
[135:20.87]Let's do it.
[135:25.20]Down arrow right here.
[135:26.24]Up arrow.
[135:32.30]Easy, though.
[135:32.96]I don't want to get... See?
[135:34.34]That's why I was being easy.
[135:36.48]See this?
[135:36.90]I have to go down there.
[135:37.96]What?
[135:41.43]I think I got it.
[135:42.39]I'm not entirely sure what's going on, but I can just go in this.
[135:46.43]Let's hope I can... Alright, hold on.
[135:53.96]Let me figure this out.
[135:56.98]Let's try this.
[136:02.38]I don't get it yet.
[136:04.03]Just in case something's going on over here that I need to see.
[136:07.45]What?
[136:07.69]What?
[136:08.01]I guess.
[136:09.19]Um...
[136:31.16]There we go.
[136:31.66]There we go.
[136:38.39]I knew it, I knew it was gonna happen.
[136:39.31]I knew it was gonna fucking happen and I fucking did it anyways.
[136:53.52]That guy, that guy needed that Koopa.
[136:58.69]No, I was looking at chat.
[136:59.57]I think that's a... Yep.
[137:01.23]See you later.
[137:02.01]That's a done deal right there.
[137:03.05]Yep.
[137:13.61]Oh, my God.
[137:15.49]I just shook my head.
[137:18.53]My head just shook around.
[137:23.93]Get out of my face.
[137:31.40]Alright, now I need to get- I need to save that shell.
[137:36.06]Lock this down.
[137:36.94]You know, I'm gonna clear out all these things.
[137:39.52]Because they will kill me, I'm certain of it.
[137:43.92]Kill that guy too.
[137:46.57]Oh boy.
[137:47.69]Okay.
[137:48.29]Well.
[137:52.67]Why don't you come over here?
[137:58.36]Um... Oh boy.
[138:01.83]Is that going to come back?
[138:02.41]That's going to come back.
[138:02.97]Give me the... At the eye.
[138:08.48]I didn't follow him.
[138:11.44]Shit.
[138:13.88]Oh, no.
[138:14.12]Now I'm dead.
[138:16.80]Just barely made that, so I can go up here.
[138:18.63]Even though I screwed that up, I can still go up here.
[138:22.51]Hopefully this will bring me around.
[138:26.87]Don't even grab it.
[138:28.03]It's not even worth me attempting to get that.
[138:33.79]bouncing all over the place.
[138:34.67]Shit's bouncing all over the place.
[138:36.41]Oh, come on.
[138:37.85]Oh, I'm reading.
[138:48.22]I'm reading the chat again.
[138:50.90]I'm looking.
[138:52.24]Okay, time to stop looking.
[138:53.96]I was going to just say something.
[138:55.54]I was going to respond to somebody, but no, we can't.
[138:59.08]God damn it.
[138:59.92]God damn it.
[139:12.10]I gotta be focused for this one.
[139:13.28]I missed it.
[139:17.38]I missed it.
[139:23.62]Hello, Otto.
[139:26.96]Missed it again.
[139:30.08]You know, I think I just gotta stop going for it.
[139:32.52]It's just, it's like a 50-50 shot if I'm gonna hit it or not.
[139:38.93]Okay, well that's what's down there.
[139:41.41]Found what's down there.
[139:42.33]I'm supposed to stop doing that.
[139:55.44]Alright, I need to stop fucking this up.
[139:58.27]That would be great.
[140:00.71]I've got a better idea.
[140:01.51]I like this idea much better.
[140:11.93]I don't like this idea because I needed to keep one of those things alive.
[140:16.61]Is it even possible for me to do this one?
[140:21.87]Kind of.
[140:23.98]No.
[140:24.50]Holy shit.
[140:28.32]Shit's shooting up at me now.
[140:37.06]Oh, come on.
[140:37.58]That thing was about to disappear.
[140:38.46]That thing was about to disappear.
[140:42.85]That was disappearing as we spoke.
[140:47.88]Nope, I got stuck.
[140:51.63]Got stuck.
[141:12.82]Oh!
[141:13.64]Oh!
[141:14.60]Oh!
[141:16.22]Oh!
[141:18.56]That was... That was luck.
[141:22.36]That's all that was.
[141:30.84]Get it!
[141:32.18]Do it!
[141:33.74]Yeah!
[141:37.00]That's all that did.
[141:38.93]That was the point of that?
[141:42.77]okay apparently that that was the point of that one I don't know like do I just I guess I just have to I guess I just have to go up there this was kind of a necessary trip I guess I'm not that small I can go down that room right yeah
[142:13.09]We don't get shot by anything.
[142:22.72]Fuck.
[142:24.14]Yeah, I gotta get in the cloud.
[142:31.44]I have to go in that cloud.
[142:39.77]The cloud is necessary for that.
[142:44.19]So it's get cloud.
[142:45.37]Where's cloud guy?
[142:47.85]Where is cloud guy?
[142:50.79]Give me your cloud.
[142:52.95]Let's move.
[142:55.34]At least now I know what to do.
[143:01.62]This should go much more smoothly next time.
[143:03.76]Because I'll kill him and just go right over here.
[143:08.76]Yeah, I'm just going to die.
[143:17.83]Don't be such a goofball.
[143:21.87]I keep killing myself because I'm glancing down at my other screen and I'm dying.
[143:31.43]Fuck me.
[143:42.36]Oh, that was... Oh, that was great!
[143:44.30]What a real not-waste-of-fucking-time that was.
[143:46.47]I'm about to rage-quit this game.
[143:52.87]And play, like, fucking iPad games.
[143:54.88]See, now I'm getting mad and I'm just fucking pissed off and this shit's just going downhill.
[144:04.12]You know what I mean?
[144:04.60]You know how that shit just goes fucking downhill, and you just start getting real angry at shit?
[144:10.86]Yeah, I don't even give a shit about that guy.
[144:12.90]Give me one of these, and I'll get this dude.
[144:18.90]I'm not gonna get him yet.
[144:22.34]Follow me all the way over here.
[144:25.53]And then I'm gonna jump up to this thing.
[144:28.13]Got it.
[144:28.61]Let's go.
[144:30.49]Move, move, move.
[144:31.17]I don't even care.
[144:31.69]I don't even know what's in that thing.
[144:34.24]This thing's gonna run out.
[144:36.08]Yeah, this is gonna run out.
[144:37.08]I just have to jump over the plant.
[144:38.52]I think.
[144:42.41]Yay!
[144:43.37]At least I made it.
[144:45.37]Back to the place where I was gonna lose.
[144:46.91]Unless I can... A new expert wasn't a good idea.
[144:59.01]My new expert wasn't a good idea?
[145:00.11]I should've just made my little shitty dumb shit level.
[145:10.68]Listen, alright, last try.
[145:12.02]This is it.
[145:18.10]What a, what a, good, good job.
[145:21.06]Very good, good work.
[145:24.15]Alright, get over here.
[145:24.81]Where is he?
[145:25.27]Cloud man.
[145:27.62]Come over here.
[145:28.52]I just want to get a safe trip to that next area.
[145:35.87]And then I guess I... You know what?
[145:37.09]Hold on.
[145:38.25]What's in here?
[145:40.07]It's a mushroom.
[145:41.45]It didn't even matter.
[145:42.13]It just hit me.
[145:42.69]Why would they give you a mushroom right here?
[145:48.02]Seems kind of like there's no reason to have it.
[146:03.00]If I were to take a wild guess, it would be something along the lines of, I'll take that.
[146:08.16]Yes, I would love one of those.
[146:09.46]Just break all this shit.
[146:15.68]Give me those mushrooms.
[146:16.68]Give me the fucking mushrooms.
[146:18.60]What did I tell you?
[146:25.14]Every time I say it's the last try, I end up doing it.
[146:29.61]Every time.
[146:37.50]I say, this is the last one.
[146:40.48]And then I beat it.
[146:48.35]Castle Cheep Cheep.
[146:54.23]With a name like Castle Cheep Cheep, I feel like it's not going to be the most fair of levels.
[147:10.72]Duck.
[147:13.76]Okay, well, that's... Holy shit.
[147:26.05]I don't even know.
[147:29.45]I don't even know.
[147:31.98]There's a lot of questions I have on this one.
[147:33.68]I slid down, it's over.
[147:34.48]Yep.
[147:36.97]Because Mario likes to hold on to the wall in this version of the Mario games.
[147:41.89]You need to let go, Mario.
[147:43.91]Let go.
[147:44.27]I guess you just stick it like this.
[147:55.79]Don't get hit by the... Oh.
[147:59.67]Shit.
[148:04.32]Cheap, cheap.
[148:10.02]No, he did it again.
[148:10.92]Stop holding onto the fucking wall!
[148:15.39]I can't touch any buttons.
[148:17.51]Otherwise it'll do that.
[148:23.84]Jump.
[148:27.68]It's such an erratic pattern for when those things shoot out.
[148:31.34]Let's take one second here to figure out what the hell is going on here.
[148:34.17]Okay, they jump all over the place.
[148:35.41]I'm going to have to do some wall jumps.
[148:40.03]I don't know what's in that box, but I'm scared to go over and try to do it.
[148:44.33]But here we go.
[148:50.08]Of course it's going to shoot one right there.
[148:58.58]So that's like a... That's the I want to troll you thing, right?
[149:05.12]You get hit right when you land.
[149:07.04]It goes... As long as I don't get hit by these things, I should be okay.
[149:12.02]At least somewhat okay.
[149:14.61]Staggered a little bit.
[149:15.75]There we go.
[149:21.69]Just go.
[149:22.17]Do the jumps.
[149:23.45]Mario, please.
[149:24.05]I want you to hold onto the walls this time.
[149:33.40]It's gonna shoot.
[149:34.46]Oh, whoa!
[149:36.16]Are you serious?
[149:40.92]What hit me?
[149:41.44]Is there... Oh, the stupid piranha plant over there.
[149:43.74]Well, at least I know that first... No, I'm gonna get hit by that thing.
[149:52.90]The first one is okay.
[149:54.62]I can get that.
[149:55.47]No problem now.
[149:56.47]Fuck.
[149:59.37]Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.
[150:05.45]First one.
[150:05.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[150:07.13]Second one.
[150:09.87]Should be able to have a good, clear view here.
[150:15.49]Mario, please.
[150:17.47]Alright, here we go.
[150:20.72]Here come the homing missiles.
[150:28.08]When in doubt, just go.
[150:31.18]And of course, of course that one piranha plant down to the lower left...
[150:35.11]That didn't need to be there.
[150:37.47]That guy just was giggling to himself, like, y'all got him.
[150:45.26]I lost, oh god, why is my chat all screwed up?
[150:47.58]What the fuck?
[150:49.54]Don't stand there again.
[150:50.52]Don't do that again, please.
[150:57.75]Well, I'm probably gonna run out of lives here.
[151:03.67]But, you know, whatever.
[151:14.04]It takes me a while, but I will beat it.
[151:16.99]I will beat this.
[151:32.76]I never played these Mario Wii U games, so the way that he's clinging to these walls... I'm trying to do it like it's Meat Boy.
[151:45.58]There we go.
[151:46.88]Those actually are a pretty long timer.
[151:49.82]Long enough, I think, for me to get this.
[151:51.46]Yes.
[151:53.68]That second one shoots a fish face out.
[151:57.06]Straight ahead.
[152:02.13]You know what?
[152:02.83]No.
[152:03.41]Boy.
[152:03.77]I don't know.
[152:05.81]I knew it was going to come out at some point.
[152:08.07]It's so hard to climb up that with those fireballs going at every second being shot out.
[152:14.21]That piranha plant is such a pain in the ass.
[152:20.17]If I can figure out the fucking pattern to get around that piranha plant, then things should go way more smoothly.
[152:33.12]Oh my god, and it didn't... he didn't do the jump.
[152:39.01]Pain in the balls.
[152:46.90]I'm going to sit here.
[152:47.64]Because then I can go shooting one at a time.
[152:51.70]No, choose three.
[152:52.50]There's three bullet bill homing missiles.
[152:55.37]He didn't jump off it.
[153:16.52]I don't know why I didn't jump off that head.
[153:18.66]That was dumb.
[153:19.68]You know what?
[153:27.00]You gotta go quick here, because here come these guys.
[153:28.90]Yep.
[153:29.22]They're just so erratic.
[153:40.20]So erratic.
[153:40.88]I actually should go right now.
[153:52.36]I don't know.
[153:55.54]I don't... What?
[153:57.01]What?
[153:57.25]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, whoa.
[153:59.09]What happened?
[154:01.29]That's a wall.
[154:02.09]I have to jump over the wall?
[154:06.33]I got right to the end there, and I just had no... I just have no idea what the hell that is.
[154:09.29]There's a wall there, so you have to go over it.
[154:16.21]Right?
[154:16.51]I mean, what the hell was that?
[154:21.96]Oh my fucking god, and it didn't jump again.
[154:29.37]Shit.
[154:29.77]Damn it.
[154:45.94]Once I get to that part, it really shouldn't be that difficult.
[154:49.94]I just didn't know that I had to go that far over.
[155:00.05]Give me a mushroom.
[155:01.99]It's a firefly.
[155:05.83]It's a fireflower.
[155:06.94]That might have just helped a ton.
[155:12.25]No, that's gonna get me killed.
[155:13.67]That is gonna get me killed.
[155:15.23]Good, I want it off.
[155:32.00]I thought that that was still on his head.
[155:33.82]I didn't think that was a you-die position.
[155:36.54]I thought that was still his head.
[155:41.25]I'm just scared for when I actually get back over there.
[155:42.85]What the fuck is this guy doing over here?
[155:45.11]When I get back over there, the real... I just don't know where it ends.
[155:50.99]Every time I'm gonna get hit by that thing.
[156:08.76]That's over.
[156:09.20]Holy fuck.
[156:12.19]Yeah, now it is.
[156:12.79]They just came too far over.
[156:22.58]I actually am enjoying this.
[156:25.04]As hard on my brain as this is right now.
[156:28.42]It's actually still pretty fun.
[156:32.78]What is he doing over here?
[156:34.08]Get out of here!
[156:37.39]Castle Cheep Cheep.
[156:38.33]I'm going to get hit by this.
[156:39.17]It's been too long.
[156:44.05]I'm doing something wrong with that, by the way.
[156:46.53]Oh, fuck.
[156:49.97]Everything just went wrong on that one.
[156:54.23]Everything just went wrong on that one.
[157:00.46]Yeah, I need to get the fire flower.
[157:01.78]You know what?
[157:02.56]That is a good idea.
[157:03.22]I can hit three times.
[157:06.94]What's gonna happen is I'm gonna get to the end of this one, and something else is gonna happen, and then I'm gonna throw up blood.
[157:17.73]Fire flower is in there.
[157:18.69]I can't get it.
[157:20.21]I'm not small.
[157:21.65]Hit me.
[157:24.13]Let's go.
[157:33.67]Oh, come on.
[157:38.11]And I jumped off the fucking wall.
[157:40.09]Oh my god.
[157:43.83]That's the worst part about games with a wall jump.
[157:47.01]Like sometimes you just stick on the corner of a wall and you're not trying to and you'll just launch off.
[157:54.33]It happens quite frequently.
[157:55.49]I actually totally forgot that that's happened.
[158:10.86]He puts him in such fucking shitty places.
[158:19.11]Each one of those piranha shooter things is in the worst possible position to play this video game.
[158:26.76]They are in every single jumping trajectory and every single spot where you're supposed to stand.
[158:34.08]And they're firing at these erratic fucking patterns.
[158:38.22]Forget about the firefly.
[158:39.24]I don't need it.
[158:41.46]I don't need the firefly.
[158:42.67]What I need to do is I need to get by this without getting hit three fucking two or three times.
[158:49.43]One, two, three.
[158:52.19]Gets three seconds for them to shoot that one.
[158:56.75]And you got the asshole behind you.
[159:05.52]Followed.
[159:06.58]Oh, wow.
[159:07.22]How?
[159:12.00]Do I have to jump over one of those bullets?
[159:14.03]Do I have to jump on a bullet, get one to follow me, and then launch over and then jump?
[159:18.33]I think that's what I have to do.
[159:22.01]What a world.
[159:29.72]Salt.
[159:31.60]Yeah, I am.
[159:33.66]This shit is fucking hard as all shit.
[159:35.86]That took too long?
[159:38.02]Yep.
[159:48.20]I mean, I'm already this, like, this far.
[159:50.02]I gotta try to beat it.
[159:50.78]I can't let this one defeat me.
[159:53.66]We didn't do Expert to stop at, like, level 7.
[159:55.78]We did Expert to beat this, because I want to beat this.
[160:01.12]And I'm talking and not paying attention.
[160:02.90]I've already... It's over.
[160:04.08]I've already lost.
[160:04.64]Here we go.
[160:06.51]This is gonna be... This is the one.
[160:08.75]This is gonna be the one.
[160:10.51]Number 33.
[160:10.95]That's my lucky number.
[160:11.81]Lucky number 33.
[160:12.43]They used to call me that in high school.
[160:15.11]3-3!
[160:18.80]Let me show you why.
[160:19.44]Let me show you why I got the nickname 3-3.
[160:22.73]It's because of this.
[160:24.91]Let me show you why they used to call me fucking 3-3 and I told them.
[160:42.60]I did the thing where I left on a fucking wall of-
[160:53.17]wall again!
[160:55.81]Give me my best impression of a fucking chimpanzee.
[161:00.77]Alright, you know, in high school they used to call me fucking 31.
[161:04.82]I'll show you why.
[161:05.42]You wanna know why?
[161:07.70]This is why they used to call me in high school number 31.
[161:15.18]All you guys are gonna see why right now.
[161:18.99]Even the principal.
[161:19.63]The principal was like, God damn, Number 31, you're so awesome.
[161:22.31]I was like, yeah, I know.
[161:24.25]Let me show you why Principal McRuber wanted to do that.
[161:29.40]Here we go.
[161:39.32]Can't kill those with that thing.
[161:47.37]There's more.
[162:06.77]Did you see where that fish was?
[162:08.73]Did you-
[162:21.58]I'm gonna need to take a shower after I play this game.
[162:28.29]Hey, you know what they used to call me back in high school?
[162:30.41]They used to call me good ol' number fucking 29.
[162:31.61]Yeah.
[162:33.07]Yeah, did I tell you?
[162:35.63]Did I tell you?
[162:36.09]Even the principal used to say that.
[162:38.22]He used to go, 2-9, that's my favorite.
[162:40.14]He's the best student in the world.
[162:42.70]Only, only, I wish I could have him as my son.
[162:46.30]That's what they used to say.
[162:47.10]That's what they used to say about me.
[162:59.02]I don't know what to do.
[162:59.56]That's what they used to say about me.
[163:02.38]Me, no matter.
[163:04.28]That's what they used to say about 29.
[163:05.70]Fuck.
[163:13.28]That's what they used to call me.
[163:16.06]That's what they used to call me.
[163:18.38]That's what they used to call me back in high school.
[163:49.99]Hey, did I ever tell you guys what they didn't used to call me when I was in high school?
[163:59.06]A number that they did not ever call me was 27.
[164:01.04]You know?
[164:06.16]Ever.
[164:07.20]What a weird nickname that would be.
[164:08.62]A number?
[164:10.38]Yeah, my nickname is a number.
[164:12.93]No, why?
[164:14.05]No one ever called me that.
[164:17.80]Why would they?
[164:18.62]You know?
[164:19.44]What kind of a strange person would you have to be to have that kind of a fucking stupid ass fucked up nickname?
[164:28.27]I don't know what happened there.
[164:35.29]God, this is so fucking hard.
[164:38.93]I just wish there wasn't any more after that debacle that is jumping over all their heads.
[164:43.31]There's a ton more.
[164:44.35]There's a ton more just like RNG after that.
[164:59.41]Wait till it shoots.
[165:01.75]Ooh, wait a minute.
[165:05.17]Wait a minute.
[165:05.67]Do you see what he's doing?
[165:07.27]He's shooting the wall.
[165:09.47]We're gonna take this to our advantage, because that's been the biggest pain in the ass.
[165:13.15]Wait till it shoots.
[165:14.07]Let's go.
[165:16.23]Oh, wow.
[165:17.96]That just made everything so much easier.
[165:24.52]Holy shit.
[165:31.67]Come on!
[165:32.41]Why did he have to jump that fucking high?
[165:37.25]Why?
[165:37.77]Why?
[165:40.47]Why?
[165:42.50]It's like the guy doesn't want you to beat this level.
[165:45.16]He's doing everything possible so you make sure you do not win.
[165:51.72]Fuck yeah, throw like a fucking grandpa level in here.
[165:56.13]It's alright, I'll get the mushroom.
[165:57.17]I mean the, uh... Oh no, I can't get it now.
[166:00.19]I'll get this mushroom down here.
[166:08.59]So that was in a weird spot.
[166:12.75]Oh, come on.
[166:13.91]Come on now.
[166:16.72]God, I gotta...
[166:28.26]That one was doomed from the beginning.
[166:32.54]That was doomed from the fucking beginning.
[166:36.82]Good thing I have 500 seconds to beat this.
[166:41.04]See, somewhere this guy's gonna watch this... He's gonna watch this whole thing.
[166:44.56]Be like, yeah, I did that.
[166:46.04]I made that.
[166:50.82]And I'm just gonna be like, dude... What the fuck?
[166:55.85]You're a jerk.
[166:59.99]I didn't time that one right.
[167:00.91]You know what?
[167:01.27]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[167:04.68]I wanted to go back and get the mushroom, but, you know, whatever.
[167:12.34]You take away the random fish at the bottom, I probably would have beaten this, like, 25 minutes ago.
[167:19.97]Not even joking.
[167:22.07]You get these fucking random-ass jumpy shithead fish out of the picture.
[167:25.29]And you got a victory.
[167:31.96]Here comes the fish.
[167:41.46]Both fish.
[167:42.56]Here's the first one.
[167:52.83]It's okay, it's okay.
[167:56.63]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[167:58.05]Here comes a bullet.
[168:00.44]Come on!
[168:09.35]I'm waiting for that fish.
[168:10.43]Where's that fish that comes up here?
[168:13.51]Does he come back?
[168:15.88]What are these?
[168:18.32]The clompers?
[168:19.30]The stompers?
[168:20.06]They don't come back.
[168:23.04]Fucking fish is going to shoot right over here.
[168:25.06]Fish is going to show up.
[168:30.49]Why did that other one go away?
[168:32.18]That's weird.
[168:35.60]Oh, God!
[168:36.14]No!
[168:36.44]Oh, God!
[168:46.36]God damn it!
[168:48.22]I should have just jumped on the fucking first one!
[168:53.34]I should have just jumped on... Okay, when I get there, jump on the first one.
[168:57.82]Do not go on that other one.
[168:59.34]You have to wait.
[169:05.13]I would have had that too if I just didn't make that same mistake twice.
[169:07.69]That's so annoying.
[169:12.45]That is annoying.
[169:20.31]You have to jump on these.
[169:21.45]That's the ticket with that.
[169:33.00]Hey, hey, guess what happened?
[169:34.80]Hey, can you guess what happened?
[169:35.90]I attached to the wall and jumped to the left.
[169:38.70]Because I grabbed onto the wall, which is like an inch fucking thick.
[169:42.92]Oh, sweet!
[169:47.21]Well, I think I'm gonna get it.
[169:49.63]If I can get back to where I was, I'm assuming that's near the end.
[170:03.82]I don't know why it does that sometimes.
[170:05.48]It's really, really, really annoying.
[170:07.96]Fuck, I didn't want to get that in case I needed it.
[170:11.56]No, I'm going to wait until that whole thing cycles out of here.
[170:14.61]Because I will run into that.
[170:18.49]Of course.
[170:18.87]Okay, here's the other one.
[170:26.11]No, I'm screwed.
[170:28.47]Yeah, I'm screwed.
[170:40.03]I can't let this level beat me.
[170:41.61]I'm not skipping it.
[170:44.41]Getting that far and skipping it is like... No.
[170:47.51]That's just like deflating a balloon and having to make that stupid fart noise.
[170:52.67]That's how I would feel as a person if I skipped this right now.
[170:59.92]No.
[171:05.18]Shoot it.
[171:05.80]Shoot your stupid thing.
[171:10.36]Oh god, a third one comes out.
[171:12.50]It's over.
[171:13.46]It's definitely done.
[171:14.96]Yeah.
[171:16.32]Now I can't even get past this fucking part.
[171:22.46]Well, I might run out of lives.
[171:24.04]If I run out of lives, then I'm just gonna go make a level.
[171:29.34]And not play this fucking level.
[171:32.32]Not play this... People who make the levels are so hard.
[171:35.88]They take like a hundred attempts to beat.
[171:38.81]That's not gonna be my level.
[171:41.55]My level's gonna be sunshine and fucking rainbows.
[171:47.86]And where everybody... You just gotta... You can beat it if you try hard enough.
[171:52.88]Oh, now I'm just talking.
[171:54.22]Stop circling me.
[171:59.94]This thing's gonna kill me.
[172:03.71]Waited too long.
[172:04.65]Yeah, this is pretty much a done deal, I think.
[172:07.81]Not quite.
[172:08.55]Yeah, it is.
[172:09.67]I waited too long.
[172:18.28]I would make, like, a joke right now, but I'm just not even close to being happy.
[172:26.02]I gotta get, like, happy.
[172:27.04]What are some happy things we can talk about?
[172:29.22]How about, uh... Like, bunny rabbits?
[172:35.23]They're pretty cool.
[172:37.09]Just hit me.
[172:37.51]I don't give a flying shit.
[172:39.31]Give me the... Don't attach to the wall like a dumb shitface.
[172:43.85]God.
[172:44.29]It doesn't have to be this, Mario.
[172:46.61]I fucking hate that mechanic.
[172:48.63]I fucking despise that mechanic.
[172:50.79]They're like, getting hanging on walls.
[172:54.70]It seriously makes me want to fucking throw up.
[173:14.58]Dude, this is probably going to be the hardest one of this whole... All the other ones were, like... This is, what, level 6?
[173:20.84]Level 7?
[173:22.18]The other ones were hard.
[173:23.72]But they were, like, completable in, like, 20 or 30 attempts.
[173:26.73]This is still... I'm still fucking doing this shit.
[173:31.33]This is, like, a 100 attempt level.
[173:40.94]Do it.
[173:41.22]Shoot it.
[173:45.23]Not enough air.
[173:48.39]Oh, I don't have any momentum either.
[173:49.95]This could be... This could be... Ah, yep.
[173:52.94]Damn it.
[174:02.61]Okay, this is the one.
[174:07.15]This is gonna be the one.
[174:17.56]Nope, I landed on that thing.
[174:43.32]I don't know how many times I've been killed by latching onto the wall and trying to jump.
[174:47.63]It's the worst thing.
[175:12.70]Come on now.
[175:17.49]Maybe I should wait for like one or two cycles for this.
[175:21.05]Yeah.
[175:21.95]Oh god.
[175:46.40]I will prevail.
[175:48.34]Go ahead, hit me.
[176:25.28]Oh my god.
[176:28.33]My hands are, like, sweating!
[176:29.93]I have sweaty ass hands.
[176:35.71]And that was a good run, too.
[176:37.35]It was just... Oh, fucking A.
[176:43.16]Like, that was a good run, and it just got, like, my fucking sweaty, sloppy-ass, fucking greasy-ass hands just, like, threw up all over that one.
[176:57.97]Oh, I don't have very many attempts left. ...
[177:14.88]I've seen the same thing so many times that I seriously think things are blending together in my brain.
[177:37.46]What the fuck is going on?
[177:39.96]Why did I just do that again?
[177:43.60]Oh man, I think I'm just tired and losing it.
[177:48.08]Why am I overthinking that one so much?
[177:50.41]Oh boy.
[177:53.07]Oh boy.
[177:55.91]Boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[177:59.58]I was looking at chat.
[178:01.46]Seeing the inevitable.
[178:02.28]Oh boy, I'm over it.
[178:03.80]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[178:05.12]Easy, easy, easy.
[178:09.65]Now... I need to slow down there.
[178:13.77]I'm getting there more reliably.
[178:15.47]Like, way more reliably than I was before.
[178:17.09]I just gotta chill.
[178:23.18]Here comes another.
[178:23.86]Shoot the other one.
[178:25.96]Oh, I got the other one pulled down, apparently.
[178:35.89]I actually would rather be small here.
[178:37.79]Actually, maybe I needed to be small here.
[178:43.71]There was nowhere to go.
[178:46.07]Yeah, I gotta be small there.
[178:46.95]That just makes it way easier.
[178:48.54]But, remember, a bullet bill comes down from the ceiling.
[178:51.26]Because, uh, because fuck you, that's why.
[178:53.12]Like, apparently.
[178:54.16]Fuck me, that's why.
[178:55.18]A bullet bill has to come down from the ceiling.
[178:57.04]Creator of this game.
[178:57.72]You had to put that there?
[178:59.36]You could've put, like, a firefly?
[179:11.46]Thankfully, I can get back there pretty much every time now.
[179:15.24]But I don't really have very many attempts.
[179:22.04]Nope, I just fucked it all up.
[179:24.06]I gotta wait till that all goes all the way over.
[179:32.12]Just shoot it.
[179:33.32]Shoot it.
[179:34.40]It's alright.
[179:42.13]Nope.
[179:42.71]Oh boy.
[179:44.53]Yeah, I don't know.
[179:45.72]I don't know.
[179:46.82]I don't know if I'm gonna do it.
[179:50.60]I don't know if I'm gonna do it.
[179:52.02]This is like 45 lives on this level.
[179:59.36]You know what I need to get?
[179:59.92]I need to get like the Wii U Pro controller or whatever the hell it is.
[180:02.28]Because I'm playing on the fucking brick.
[180:06.05]That's like already like a hindrance.
[180:15.94]I really wish I wasn't on this.
[180:17.08]I feel like I'm holding on to a... handlebars on a bicycle.
[180:24.39]Alright, let me wipe my hands down.
[180:28.99]Get prepared.
[180:32.02]I'm putting the other iPad on the ground.
[180:36.26]Let's get ready.
[180:43.93]Oh, fuck.
[180:45.27]Shoot it.
[180:46.49]Shoot another one.
[180:48.60]Shoot another one.
[180:52.48]Shoot another one.
[181:08.33]Oh my god.
[181:09.41]I didn't jump on it.
[181:11.89]That quarter second delay, whatever it is from this thing, is really, really putting a stake in my ass.
[181:25.98]Big time.
[181:27.96]Stuff like that should just never happen.
[181:29.38]But because of this stupid input delay, it's happened quite a few fucking times, actually.
[181:44.57]Like, see, I should never be missing these.
[181:46.97]But for some fucked up reason, it happens.
[181:49.39]I don't know why, I don't know what's going on.
[181:53.32]I have like a 145 second input delay, I'm gonna cry about it.
[181:55.88]Let's go, fuck it.
[182:15.56]That really is causing me so many problems, though.
[182:19.84]If I'm going to be totally Frank.
[182:32.52]BabyRage.
[182:33.16]Let's see the chat fill up with BabyRage.
[182:42.91]Come on!
[182:43.63]Stop doing that shit!
[182:45.89]That's the type of shit that can't happen.
[182:48.65]That gets me in a lot of trouble.
[182:51.31]Okay, please.
[183:04.46]Please don't do it again.
[183:06.22]Holy shit, it almost just happened again.
[183:10.28]Bullet Bill?
[183:10.98]Don't even think about it.
[183:23.72]What the fuck?
[183:25.14]What?
[183:25.92]Whoa.
[183:26.68]What he could do?
[183:27.32]He didn't do that before.
[183:28.41]He did not do that last time.
[183:30.45]He did not do that last time.
[183:33.81]What on Earth just happened?
[183:40.04]I have to think about this, because if it's right there...
[183:46.24]I just don't know.
[183:46.92]Because I can't jump over that.
[183:52.14]I can take the hit, but... Jump over it now, maybe?
[183:59.76]Oh, gotta go now.
[184:04.15]Fucking fish.
[184:04.59]It's over.
[184:06.09]I'm dead.
[184:08.17]There's even more after that.
[184:09.63]I was certain.
[184:10.41]I was 100% certain that the end was going to be right there.
[184:16.66]At least, I just was thinking too much about it.
[184:19.26]Oh, man.
[184:21.12]This is very, very, very, very, very, very... Because now there's more for me to memorize.
[184:27.53]At that.
[184:27.89]I have to, like, memorize that part.
[184:33.85]Oh, that was just sloppy.
[184:35.05]Sigh.
[184:47.51]Oh yeah, we're getting real sloppy.
[184:48.83]That came way too close.
[184:56.05]Regardless, I'm making a level after this.
[185:00.00]Fuck all this hard shit.
[185:03.60]Your name of your level is, this level is cheap.
[185:07.60]How dare you.
[185:19.62]That's okay.
[185:21.22]There he is.
[185:26.35]There he comes.
[185:28.95]Don't do that again.
[185:48.71]Why did he didn't do it this time?
[185:51.03]Of course he didn't.
[185:52.71]And now he's up here with me.
[185:54.33]Now he's up here with me.
[185:56.17]Ah, d- Nah, I don't know.
[186:03.74]I don't know if I can do it.
[186:05.00]I don't know.
[186:05.42]I just don't know.
[186:09.52]Why did he have to come up and start throwing?
[186:11.42]That guy has done something fucking weird the last two times I've gotten there.
[186:16.80]First he stomps through the ground.
[186:20.45]And then this guy jumps up through the little platform where he, like, lives, and is ready to throw an axe at me, and I can't, like, think.
[186:54.50]Get out of here.
[186:55.12]All you fishes, please, please go on your merry way.
[186:58.97]Bullet Bill is coming down here right now.
[187:02.15]Yikes.
[187:04.69]Alright, I hope he doesn't do that.
[187:05.71]I hope he does not do that again.
[187:08.57]Alright, what other weird shit are you going to do this time, Duddy?
[187:19.72]Good.
[187:20.00]He didn't do anything stupidly strange this time.
[187:28.82]It's okay.
[187:30.62]It's alright.
[187:32.00]I just don't know what happens over here.
[187:34.45]Wait for them to get by.
[187:35.33]I have a second.
[187:38.15]There's a thing to jump on.
[187:41.63]Do I have enough momentum?
[187:42.45]I'm not sure.
[187:46.90]Nothing else is going to jump up at me.
[187:48.64]I've gone past that point.
[187:50.12]Except for those.
[187:57.95]mushroom give it to me don't know what's over here but I have to jump off this guy you gotta be fucking kidding me that's it right there that's the end I apparently didn't have enough speed that's literally the end right there too there's a bowser there who knows what kind of fucked up bowser is going to be over there it's gonna be like five of them
[188:27.54]Well, down to the final three attempts.
[188:32.88]I hope you're enjoying this.
[188:37.34]I hope it's at least entertaining to watch me fail at this level, like, literally 52 times.
[188:48.47]Hey, I did it again.
[188:50.27]Get back to square one.
[188:51.09]Square one, square one, square one.
[188:52.71]Easy, easy.
[188:53.37]Slow it down.
[188:57.05]Oh, God.
[188:59.69]They've already moved over here.
[189:00.57]Yeah, this is toast.
[189:03.15]This is toast.
[189:05.45]Unless I can come up with a miracle jump here.
[189:09.69]That is what I would consider a miracle jump.
[189:11.93]That was a miracle jump.
[189:23.24]Miracles have seriously been witnessed.
[189:30.33]Like, I'm glad everyone, like, said their prayers this evening.
[189:32.91]Because, uh, that was okay.
[189:38.26]No, he's up here again.
[189:41.26]Can he even throw that far?
[189:42.32]He can't.
[189:43.76]Fuck yourself.
[189:47.06]He can do that, though.
[189:48.02]Let's see, we're gonna go slow again.
[189:54.04]Because, uh, that's the lie.
[189:55.59]I want to try to get two hits here.
[190:00.25]There's another big fat fish.
[190:05.29]Alright, let's do it.
[190:11.25]Damn it.
[190:11.69]I don't know.
[190:12.05]I gotta... I gotta wait till he's at the peak of his jump.
[190:21.30]Oh my god!
[190:22.04]There's a wall!
[190:23.46]There's a wall!
[190:24.08]He put a fucking wall!
[190:25.36]He put a fucking wall!
[190:26.86]He put a wall.
[190:27.46]This guy put a fucking wall up
[190:30.31]I... I just threw... My iPad's on the ground.
[190:32.89]I don't even know... The guy put a wall up.
[190:34.19]There's a wall there.
[190:35.29]That was the end.
[190:35.67]I beat it.
[190:36.33]I beat... I beat it.
[190:37.01]I beat the level.
[190:37.59]I beat the level.
[190:39.05]I beat it.
[190:40.13]I... I... I beat it.
[190:41.75]That was it.
[190:42.85]I won.
[190:43.67]I won.
[190:46.21]Trying to run by Bowser.
[190:47.35]Everybody knows that fucking Bowser... Bowser's like, you can do that.
[190:51.67]Everybody knows that that's what happens.
[190:54.09]You run right by Bowser.
[190:54.89]You touch the thing.
[190:55.39]That's what every single one of these levels has been.
[191:00.45]Every single one of these levels.
[191:02.99]Dude puts a wall up.
[191:07.05]Dude puts a wall up right there.
[191:09.35]Just in case you have trouble with this level.
[191:13.05]And you're trying to get power.
[191:14.17]You do the big jump.
[191:16.27]Put a giant red wall so I have to jump way over it.
[191:19.91]I don't even know.
[191:20.39]I can't even normally jump over that wall, can I?
[191:22.23]I think I have to go over the top.
[191:24.67]Oh, it's the last level.
[191:28.25]Last life.
[191:30.91]And I'm just drained of all my ability to even pretend to play this game.
[191:35.55]I just want to make the damn level.
[191:36.53]I just want to relax and make fucking Mario level.
[191:39.90]Where's the camera?
[191:40.70]Camera, where are you?
[191:44.14]Stuff the camera up your ass.
[191:50.72]That dude puts a wall.
[191:53.58]Put a wall up.
[191:54.80]And now there's a wall.
[191:58.14]I just couldn't get it.
[192:01.07]I couldn't fucking... Dude puts a fucking wall up.
[192:04.87]Big red wall.
[192:06.41]Behind him.
[192:07.99]No, it's just that... Where's that guy's level?
[192:12.35]I'm gonna write something on that.
[192:14.09]I'm gonna write, dude puts a fucking wall up.
[192:18.01]I don't even think I can do it.
[192:37.00]I'm addicted.
[192:37.56]I wanna, like, do it again.
[193:03.54]Yeah.
[193:04.28]Yeah.
[193:04.58]I got something for you.
[193:05.92]How do I write something?
[193:11.55]Zero.
[193:12.11]Does that mean I'm the seventh person to play this?
[193:21.38]How do I say something?
[193:22.32]Is there a way to write?
[193:27.10]I'm just gonna draw a bunch of dumb shit.
[193:35.92]Let me download that one.
[193:38.50]What is that thing over there?
[193:41.68]1534.
[193:41.70]I gave it an attempt.
[193:42.85]I gave it my best effort.
[193:45.59]Wait, nobody has beaten this?
[193:46.87]Is that what that means?
[193:47.49]Are you telling me I could have been the first person to clear that?
[193:56.53]Oh, that would have been so... Oh, man.
[194:01.24]That would've been cool if I was, like, the first dude to clear that.
[194:04.38]I'm so depressed.
[194:07.52]I'm just depressed right now.
[194:09.08]Like, I, I, yeah, I beat it.
[194:10.67]You all saw me win.
[194:13.11]The axe was right there.
[194:13.99]I touched the axe.
[194:16.05]I beat, I beat that level.
[194:17.29]Okay.
[194:17.59]I mean, it'd be one thing if I kept dying at, like, the first part, but I, yeah, I got to the end, right?
[194:29.21]Man.
[194:29.59]Well, I hope it was entertaining.
[194:34.57]That's all I care about.
[194:36.67]And writing a bunch of fucking swears on this guy's thing.
[194:40.61]But I don't know how to do that.
[194:43.21]Okay, like, banned from Nintendo.
[194:46.27]I was gonna, like, draw, like, a picture and be like, fuck you, your level fucking sucks.
[194:51.48]And then I'm gonna get, like, a permaban from Nintendo.
[194:56.62]Alright, let's go to the main menu.
[194:57.66]I'm just gonna chill.
[194:58.88]Just relax.
[195:00.50]Let's make a course.
[195:01.89]I'm just gonna relax.
[195:03.17]You know, there's no reason to freak out about stuff like that.
[195:08.87]Look at my level.
[195:09.67]Let's go over my level one more time.
[195:12.93]It's right here.
[195:13.92]You start, you fall down.
[195:15.02]Whoa, are you gonna make it or not?
[195:17.30]Maybe you will.
[195:18.94]But look, this is just good old-fashioned Mario fun where there's mushrooms sitting.
[195:24.54]You see, this is fun.
[195:27.24]Let's expand on this.
[195:28.50]I'm going to start a new one.
[195:29.34]Remember the time Jerma was the first one to beat this level?
[195:35.87]It was awesome.
[195:45.47]God, you know when you just have no fulfillment?
[195:49.82]I'm just fulfillment-less right now.
[195:55.79]My little dog.
[195:56.45]You know what?
[195:57.21]Otto, come here.
[195:59.19]Hey, good dog.
[196:01.39]Otto will make me feel better.
[196:06.39]So let's... I threw my stylus somewhere in the mayhem of me complaining about that level.
[196:14.00]I don't know where it went.
[196:14.80]Hold on.
[196:15.70]Let me find this shit.
[196:25.43]I really thought I was gonna beat it.
[196:27.67]I really thought I was gonna beat it.
[196:31.93]I haven't even eaten.
[196:32.67]I have cheese and crackers over here.
[196:34.03]I haven't even, like, eaten one of them.
[196:37.43]I just wanted to beat that Mario level.
[196:42.24]We're gonna shake this up.
[196:42.90]We're gonna make a weird level.
[196:46.30]So...
[196:48.30]If I can find the stylus, is this gonna get me angry, too?
[196:51.58]Where's the stylus?
[196:52.46]Where's the goddamn stylus?
[196:53.54]You're gonna lose the stylus?
[196:54.38]Where's the damn stylus?
[196:57.02]But really, though?
[196:58.64]Where's the... Oh.
[196:59.80]It's in my crotch.
[197:02.26]It was in the fly of my zipper here.
[197:06.98]Found it.
[197:07.44]Alright, let me put my feet up.
[197:10.94]Put my chair back a little bit and let's... Let's just hang out.
[197:15.52]Just you, me, Mario Maker.
[197:19.05]See Mario right there?
[197:19.89]Gonna be making a couple of things here.
[197:21.73]Gonna be making a... Gonna be doing an underground level tonight.
[197:27.19]Gonna put some of these... Put some walls up here.
[197:29.95]This is gonna be a very linear level.
[197:33.14]Let's go up here.
[197:34.36]Wait, is that really my hand?
[197:37.17]Look, that's my hand!
[197:40.25]I didn't even see that before, I was like my- I was so locked in.
[197:45.05]I really thought that was my hand.
[197:46.65]I fucking for real thought that was- it looks like my hand.
[197:58.90]That looks like my fucking hand, I swear to god that's my hand on the screen.
[198:04.22]God, what kind of like drugs am I on right now?
[198:06.86]Alright, let's reset.
[198:18.57]The more that I think about it, it's like, what?
[198:20.27]There's no camera pointing down from the ceiling.
[198:33.33]yourself together she looks like my fucking hand that's my hand alright we're gonna make this put this here why is it happen what is that on the screen why Nintendo love all things wiser look at hand a human hand
[199:01.88]Let's just make this like that.
[199:05.80]You guys have no idea how much I freak the fuck out.
[199:08.08]Because my peripheral vision saw that on my big screen up here.
[199:13.78]Jeez.
[199:14.20]Because it's spooky.
[199:15.96]Alright, I want this to be... First of all, I want... We wouldn't be able to troll about this, you know?
[199:22.71]We have to run through... Let's delete some of that.
[199:28.03]I just dropped my iPad.
[199:29.75]That would be great.
[199:41.73]all this shit that I don't have.
[199:43.91]Let's clean that up.
[199:53.22]Okay, so we're going to keep that going.
[199:55.36]I'm going to do one, one, two.
[199:59.65]One, two.
[200:00.57]One, two.
[200:07.51]Let's do that.
[200:09.37]Yeah, hold on.
[200:11.31]Hold on a second.
[200:12.33]Just give me one second.
[200:14.93]So they're going to start the level off.
[200:18.05]They're going to have to run for a little bit.
[200:23.12]We'll make things a little bit dangerous.
[200:24.36]We'll make it a little bit dangerous.
[200:27.68]If you want to try to get that, you can get it if you want.
[200:31.70]Although I'm pretty sure that's impossible.
[200:36.27]That's not possible to get this, right?
[200:38.95]No, it is.
[200:39.43]It is.
[200:39.77]It's very possible.
[200:40.45]Oh, you can change the hand model and the settings?
[200:45.71]Are you kidding me?
[200:46.15]Let's take a look.
[200:46.73]I need to see that.
[200:50.72]Uh, gamepad, 3D audio, notifications, course comments, controls.
[200:54.86]Where is it?
[200:57.18]I don't see it.
[201:03.57]Whatever.
[201:06.00]Alright, so that is gettable.
[201:06.90]That's doable.
[201:07.74]We'll put a... put a mushroom in there.
[201:09.45]It's gonna be real dangerous, but if you're able to get there, then, you know, good for you.
[201:20.33]Press the stick?
[201:25.68]I don't fucking even know what's happening in my life.
[201:33.38]What do I want next?
[201:36.52]Maybe I should put something to jump over.
[201:37.60]Yeah.
[201:39.55]You're gonna have to do some jumping here.
[201:41.17]Like that.
[201:47.65]Maybe another... Like that.
[201:50.49]Can you get over that?
[201:51.53]Is that possible to go over that?
[201:53.82]I like how you can just test it immediately.
[201:55.18]That's awesome.
[201:59.88]Oh, you mean like the thumbsticks.
[202:01.24]Okay, I getcha.
[202:08.55]Yeah, I'm immersed in my video game.
[202:10.56]Yeah, that's real dangerous.
[202:16.38]Good.
[202:18.26]I wonder if you can even get over this.
[202:20.30]Can I even beat my own level?
[202:22.24]Probably not.
[202:25.03]Yeah, you can get over that.
[202:27.37]Very nice.
[202:27.85]Click the gamepad stick.
[202:33.87]Hey, look at that.
[202:38.61]You can have like a Mickey Mouse hand?
[202:42.11]What else is there?
[202:53.96]Cat paw.
[202:58.52]Only Nintendo would do something like that.
[203:01.44]Do do do do do do.
[203:09.22]Alright, let me go back to this.
[203:16.57]Okay, we're gonna put a secret.
[203:18.47]Right at the- Don't tell anybody.
[203:20.65]But right at the beginning of the level.
[203:24.51]You can go up here.
[203:27.57]And there's gonna be a bunch of secret shit up here.
[203:32.27]You can win the game if you come up here.
[203:35.82]Yeah, like here, ready?
[203:46.95]That you'll never know unless you were watching this stream.
[203:58.24]Yeah, that's Mario's hand.
[204:00.37]God.
[204:05.47]I'm having some trouble right now.
[204:08.59]So see, it's a guaranteed win.
[204:10.89]There you go, guaranteed win.
[204:21.90]Get rid of that.
[204:22.50]I'm gonna put this higher.
[204:26.22]Let's put it, like, here.
[204:28.68]Is that, like, just out of reach?
[204:31.68]Let's find out.
[204:32.20]Let's find out.
[204:53.40]It is just barely out of reach.
[204:55.96]That's so obvious.
[204:56.90]That's so obvious.
[204:58.04]We're scrapping that.
[204:58.77]That's, like, the easiest thing I've ever seen.
[205:00.63]It's so obvious.
[205:03.73]We'll keep it there for now, though, just in case I decide to go against it.
[205:08.23]Okay.
[205:10.75]Let's put... I'm gonna have some coins.
[205:18.89]Three, two, three.
[205:25.48]What does this little shithead do again?
[205:26.62]Oh.
[205:37.95]How bad?
[205:38.49]How hard is this jump?
[205:43.57]Yeah, you slip around a little bit.
[205:45.45]Yeah, you can do it.
[205:52.75]It's doable.
[205:58.77]No hidden blocks?
[206:00.98]No.
[206:01.66]No hidden blocks.
[206:02.72]I want you to think there are hidden blocks.
[206:06.12]Okay.
[206:07.70]Danger mushroom right there.
[206:09.25]It's dangerous.
[206:12.45]Wait, undo.
[206:14.67]No, redo.
[206:16.79]There is no redo.
[206:18.64]Oops.
[206:23.86]Okay.
[206:24.82]Now I need to have, like, somewhat of a normal little bit here.
[206:31.78]Maybe one more, like, jump.
[206:33.90]That's really annoying to do.
[206:37.90]And then we take this all the way like that.
[206:43.03]Come up with it.
[206:48.79]This...
[206:56.30]I'm going to do the thing where the level's over, but... Gotcha level's not over.
[207:05.21]You know what I mean?
[207:07.09]It's going to be such a gotcha moment.
[207:16.03]Da-da-da-da.
[207:19.02]Da-da-da-da.
[207:25.93]replace these with this to make it so much more obvious that it's the end of the level.
[207:30.02]It's not.
[207:31.12]Fix that in a second.
[207:32.52]There we are.
[207:33.40]Just like that.
[207:34.20]Oh, what a doozy.
[207:35.24]What a doozy.
[207:35.64]Do you see this doozy?
[207:56.41]You know what?
[207:57.51]How about this one?
[208:00.46]You can't beat my level.
[208:04.20]This is the end.
[208:05.48]Just kidding.
[208:06.48]You gotta break this.
[208:08.20]Oh, wow.
[208:09.02]What a... You wanna talk about a crazy twist?
[208:15.73]This is the twist right here, guys.
[208:18.45]Gotta get that mushroom back here.
[208:21.19]You think you're gonna be able to win?
[208:22.41]Gotta get that mushroom.
[208:24.97]otherwise you're toast you gotta do it again pretty pretty hard that was pretty difficult let's try it again
[208:45.13]It's not quite there yet, but... See, I know the secret to that one, because I made it.
[208:49.35]I'm the creator of this level, so I know all the secrets and nuances and how everything works.
[208:58.22]So you get to here.
[208:58.84]Oh yeah, oh yeah, don't worry, you're good.
[209:02.56]Next part of the level.
[209:08.12]And just to be a real prick about things...
[209:14.02]Just to make sure you don't... you don't have a chance.
[209:19.55]I wish I had more stuff.
[209:25.19]Okay.
[209:26.03]Put a couple of these here.
[209:32.52]Yeah, why not?
[209:34.60]This is where it gets dangerous.
[209:46.13]No, that's not the end.
[209:47.85]A little bit more.
[209:49.79]Not that much, but a little bit more.
[209:52.65]Wow, he sure got me.
[209:56.18]Didn't I, though?
[210:04.70]So now we're going to put new one here.
[210:07.06]Now, can you mess with the timers on these things?
[210:13.22]Can I determine when this is gonna pop up?
[210:16.22]What the fuck just happened?
[210:20.22]What's going on?
[210:24.99]My battery died on my Wii U gamepad.
[210:30.11]I can't say I don't know what's happening.
[210:31.51]Hold on, let me plug it in.
[210:36.85]Hold on.
[210:44.41]This thing died.
[210:45.25]I wonder why it died.
[210:47.11]Maybe because I played, like, an hour and ten minutes on the same level.
[210:58.28]Can I do it with the Wii?
[211:01.44]If I can just do it like this, I don't care.
[211:02.70]I'll do it.
[211:04.72]Nope.
[211:05.38]I cannot.
[211:07.26]I can move him around, but I can't actually use the Wii mode.
[211:16.90]Let me just plug it in.
[211:18.88]One second, guys.
[211:19.58]One second.
[211:20.12]Ow.
[211:20.50]Ow.
[211:59.00]Oh, there it is.
[212:10.83]Do I have an open outlet I can put this in?
[212:12.61]I hope so.
[212:16.99]Otherwise... I might have to just play more levels.
[212:22.47]Because that's all I can really do if I don't have the gamepad.
[212:30.47]What a great stream that's going on right now.
[212:34.15]You know, you got a guy that's, you know, doesn't even charge his batteries on his Wii U gamepad.
[212:41.07]I'd like to punch that guy in his face.
[212:42.73]Alright.
[212:48.25]We got some juice.
[212:50.91]Can I turn it back on?
[212:58.40]Go ahead.
[212:59.24]Let's do it.
[213:02.62]Hey, we have life.
[213:06.20]Look at that.
[213:06.76]Now I can move.
[213:12.14]My question was, can you determine the timers on these guys?
[213:16.71]Modification settings manual.
[213:27.51]Maybe not.
[213:28.93]Can you?
[213:30.84]Let me get my second iPad to see what people are saying.
[213:40.28]Stick a fork in an outlet, please?
[213:42.16]What the fuck?
[213:49.14]Alright.
[213:54.27]Let's do it.
[213:58.05]Couple more of those.
[213:59.23]I want them to be random.
[214:04.77]I put way too much orange juice on this gamepad.
[214:07.65]Yeah, I probably shouldn't have tried to pour orange juice on my gamepad.
[214:10.83]That probably would have helped.
[214:22.00]Can I give him wings?
[214:22.74]This one will just be sitting here.
[214:33.92]This one.
[214:34.64]Move this one down so you think you're safe.
[214:37.56]But you just have no idea.
[214:41.14]Is that too much?
[214:45.40]Is that too stupid?
[214:48.84]Oh, it could do.
[214:49.76]You know what?
[214:50.56]You're just safe.
[214:51.36]No, no, no, no, no.
[214:53.91]Hold on.
[214:54.33]Hold on a second.
[214:56.63]Hold on just one second here, man.
[215:00.53]You think you died when you fell?
[215:03.73]Nope.
[215:04.97]Because we give people second chances here.
[215:13.37]That comes up like this.
[215:16.05]But, because you got a second chance, you're going to deal with all this shit.
[215:23.07]You do get a second chance, but you better make it count.
[215:32.90]How noticeable is that?
[215:35.10]Is that really noticeable?
[215:36.86]Alright, let's do it.
[215:44.09]Let's see what happens here.
[215:49.31]So they are random.
[215:51.51]Kind of, right?
[215:53.25]Where did this one go?
[215:57.11]Oh, you can see them.
[216:05.18]I gotta take away the wings.
[216:10.10]How do you get the wings off this guy?
[216:16.08]Get the wings off of you.
[216:19.77]Anybody have wings?
[216:22.67]Goomba's got wings.
[216:23.65]Okay.
[216:23.83]Now you shouldn't be able to see me.
[216:36.55]Wow, real exciting stuff.
[216:41.19]Can you still see them?
[216:48.00]Move those up a little.
[216:51.78]Just in case.
[216:55.20]Alright.
[217:02.66]This is going to lead up to here.
[217:07.89]There are a bunch of coins.
[217:10.80]Now, if you made it this far, congratulations.
[217:12.52]Here are some coins.
[217:20.64]You win.
[217:28.65]And then if you can see up here, there's going to be a smiley face.
[217:34.84]Let's try it.
[217:36.34]Let's just take a look.
[217:37.44]Take a gander at it.
[217:40.12]Alright.
[217:49.05]Play.
[217:52.73]There's kind of no reason for the mushroom.
[218:03.09]I broke through.
[218:06.78]Oh, I can't do it now.
[218:07.84]I can't beat the level.
[218:10.60]Next thing you go, whoa, what the hell?
[218:13.28]What a dick.
[218:14.18]Start over.
[218:25.69]Whoops.
[218:28.67]Whoops.
[218:35.06]No reason for the coins either at this point.
[218:45.76]And you can just walk over that, I just realized.
[218:52.26]Made it through phase one.
[218:53.38]Oh, phase two.
[218:55.38]Oh no!
[219:01.36]I made it to the end.
[219:03.58]I win.
[219:04.94]Holy shit, that was kind of a hard jump.
[219:13.90]No, let's make the mushroom impossible to get.
[219:15.65]Let's be real mean.
[219:16.89]Let's be real mean about it.
[219:17.77]Maybe we should just be right there.
[219:24.19]No.
[219:30.45]What is going on?
[219:30.81]What is the sound effects right now?
[219:32.17]What is going on in the background here?
[219:35.95]How do I make that so it's harder to get?
[219:47.07]Like that, maybe?
[219:59.32]Maybe?
[220:06.83]Let's see.
[220:11.41]That's a little bit harder.
[220:15.19]What was with that mushroom?
[220:19.20]That was a really weird mushroom.
[220:22.48]Yeah, I'm gonna get rid of this too.
[220:29.99]So you gotta get that mid-jump.
[220:38.48]oh yeah yeah whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa easy easy easy hold on a second wait just a second here get rid of all this you gotta go mid jump you're gonna make the whole thing you're gonna make the jump where do you end up right there actually let's see even further jump nope comes out too fast
[221:08.26]Bang.
[221:08.80]Okay.
[221:10.66]Right there.
[221:19.28]Getting carried away.
[221:20.30]Ooh, that's cool.
[221:24.54]That's cool.
[221:33.55]Oh fuck, he fell off.
[221:38.08]Is there a way?
[221:38.52]How do I?
[221:38.92]I wish there was a... There's no way to mess with this guy's behavior, huh?
[221:44.30]I guess I could just do this.
[221:47.84]Alright.
[221:50.38]That's easy enough.
[221:51.84]Let's try that.
[221:56.86]Is he gonna jump?
[222:10.97]So, yeah, you missed that mushroom?
[222:15.03]You gotta start over again.
[222:16.05]Maybe I'll do, like... Okay.
[222:21.06]That might be a little too much.
[222:24.02]Maybe.
[222:24.78]And then you can use that to jump up here.
[222:31.50]Alright.
[222:44.91]Make him a green shell.
[222:47.01]Make him a red shelled Koopa.
[222:54.93]Shake the Koopa to make him turn red.
[222:56.75]Can you shake coins too?
[222:57.97]Guess not.
[222:58.91]Oh, onto it.
[223:15.08]Yeah, you don't have to do that.
[223:15.94]You're right.
[223:16.44]You're right, chatter.
[223:18.95]What if I do this?
[223:20.45]It's still possible.
[223:29.31]It's definitely still possible.
[223:30.41]How about even higher?
[223:36.41]No.
[223:37.81]That might be too high to even hit.
[223:42.01]No.
[223:45.40]There we are.
[223:46.96]No, you have to do that.
[223:58.69]Gotta time it right.
[224:03.95]Oh, I see.
[224:04.41]I can't even time it.
[224:05.35]I like it.
[224:05.77]I like that.
[224:06.13]I wish I could put more things in here.
[224:08.89]I would put this all around being able to do jumps like that.
[224:21.80]Alright, so we can get rid of this, then?
[224:23.00]A few reds won't walk off the edge.
[224:25.18]Okay.
[224:25.94]Sounds like a plan.
[224:29.92]I'll put a couple there, then.
[224:31.34]Let's put, like... You can do two.
[224:39.03]We'll do one with... One of these.
[224:41.03]I'm moving backwards too much.
[224:53.92]Not enough momentum.
[224:56.58]I like this.
[224:57.24]Alright, this works.
[225:04.56]Yeah, see, and I get screwed up with those guys.
[225:08.92]You can save, right?
[225:10.58]Because I want to, like, actually get items.
[225:14.04]And use them.
[225:17.00]Like a saw blade come across, like, here.
[225:18.80]I have just, like, bullet bills shooting this direction.
[225:29.23]Oh, that's good to know.
[225:39.62]Oh, no!
[225:40.96]I got to the end.
[225:41.66]I can't get out of here.
[225:45.86]Couldn't you get the mushroom, go back, and just do the jump a second time?
[225:49.02]I don't know.
[225:50.18]I don't think so.
[225:52.04]I mean, maybe you can, but it's kind of hard.
[226:03.79]Trying to replicate what you're asking.
[226:05.27]Let's see.
[226:07.45]Yeah, I guess you can.
[226:11.72]Is it time to remove this?
[226:14.96]Is that still... Is that doable?
[226:19.72]Kind of.
[226:20.18]What the hell?
[226:30.03]This mushroom doesn't do anything.
[226:34.90]You can throw the mushroom out of it.
[226:36.66]Shaking this doesn't do much.
[226:40.96]Why is that?
[226:41.50]I can't turn it into a 1-up?
[226:52.89]I don't even know if this is still possible.
[226:54.25]I don't know.
[226:57.83]Now that it's there, I might have to move it forward a little bit.
[227:01.45]Try it a couple more times.
[227:06.20]Yeah, I'm going to have to move it.
[227:09.52]I'll have to move it one more block this way.
[227:14.73]No, that's a mug.
[227:21.31]Put a brick over the first two open bricks so you can only run and build up momentum.
[227:25.77]That's not a bad idea.
[227:26.85]Oops.
[227:36.06]Ah, yeah, you just barely make it.
[227:41.05]Alright, now I have to test to make sure you can't go backwards.
[227:45.93]Like, can you hit this and still come back?
[227:50.57]No.
[227:51.61]Not really.
[227:52.09]Are you saying they put one here?
[228:06.25]So you have to, let's see, let's try it.
[228:10.83]I could spend all day doing this if I had like more of the things.
[228:13.53]You can turn Mario into a Luigi.
[228:22.55]Oh, you make him big or small.
[228:36.17]I just wish I could put more of these things.
[228:37.59]I can't really do much.
[228:45.71]So I have to move my Wii clock forward?
[228:49.49]Is that what I have to do?
[228:55.31]Apparently.
[228:55.77]Well, maybe for next time.
[229:00.54]I just want to mess around a little bit.
[229:05.14]Because I'd like to put much more hazards and much more things here, but there's not very much to start off with.
[229:11.94]I'll save this, though.
[229:13.26]Save and exit.
[229:18.22]Is there a way to save?
[229:19.40]How do I save?
[229:22.51]Save, save, save.
[229:26.25]Who saved?
[229:30.63]If you frustrate your players on the first jump, your level's not going to rate well.
[229:36.48]Well, I'll tweak it.
[229:41.68]Tweak this.
[229:42.95]Tweak this some other day.
[229:58.93]Make a bunch of junk blocks?
[230:07.23]What does this thing even do?
[230:08.97]Just do random property?
[230:11.95]Random mushroom?
[230:15.48]Whatever.
[230:20.22]You unlock more by beating other people's levels.
[230:22.90]I beat a bunch earlier.
[230:25.65]I only got like one unlock.
[230:27.47]I'll go do some more of that.
[230:30.37]Until I can get some more stuff unlocked, it's pretty limited.
[230:34.87]It's fun though.
[230:37.25]I'll play another little string of levels.
[230:42.42]And then I'm going to go to bed.
[230:48.80]Yeah, I wouldn't publish this one, no way.
[230:52.24]I'd want to get something interesting done with it.
[230:54.77]I'd want to have stuff like that happen, and you have to do that multiple times.
[231:00.92]But not so terrible that, you know, you end up like I was, yelling at things.
[231:05.87]To be fair, though, that level that that guy made was pretty damn good.
[231:15.73]Alright, 10 Mario Challenge.
[231:18.11]Can I do this one on normal?
[231:19.21]Or expert or something?
[231:27.82]No.
[231:27.96]Let's go back.
[231:28.42]You know that I've had some time to, like, warm up a little bit?
[231:34.08]I want to go to courses.
[231:37.90]We'll try one of the good featured ones, because I was all over the place earlier this evening.
[231:46.21]Mr. Chomp's Doghouse, that gave me a... Let's look at this.
[231:55.82]So there's only a 22.37% clear, right?
[231:59.72]So no, maybe I wasn't crazy.
[232:01.72]This is just extremely difficult.
[232:05.46]Only 15 people have beaten it out of 632 attempts.
[232:08.30]Or 632 people.
[232:11.62]That's kind of crazy.
[232:18.57]Let's go back.
[232:21.19]Where's one with like a 20% or 10% or something?
[232:22.07]Alright, one shell.
[232:22.49]This has a 1% clear ratio.
[232:23.21]Damn.
[232:23.37]Boy, star rankings.
[232:36.76]Don't press anything.
[232:38.50]I played that one before, didn't I?
[232:40.62]Look at how many ratings this has.
[232:42.56]Don't press anything 2.
[232:45.49]Press right, run, and enjoy.
[232:49.81]Let's do that one.
[232:50.43]53, you can apparently still not beat this one.
[233:00.02]Let's go for it.
[233:02.42]Let's go for it.
[233:04.58]I need to...
[233:06.82]Alright.
[233:08.32]So press right.
[233:13.16]I was holding right.
[233:14.36]I did something wrong.
[233:15.92]Look at all the deaths.
[233:17.60]A ton of people died there.
[233:21.86]It says something.
[233:23.52]He's in a car.
[233:24.30]He's like a little bumper car.
[233:29.92]I'm in a little go-kart.
[233:35.17]Think about how long this took to make.
[233:38.67]Mario in a go-kart.
[233:40.32]You just drive straight and a bunch of cool things happen around you.
[233:45.28]I feel like I'm playing Braid.
[233:54.72]This is so cool.
[233:57.71]Damn, man.
[233:58.83]Some people are just super, super crazy creative.
[234:01.14]It's awesome.
[234:02.68]That was awesome.
[234:03.64]That was so cool.
[234:14.35]What else is there?
[234:14.95]Oh, the pyro.
[234:18.59]That was made by the pyro.
[234:24.39]Alright, what about... What about don't press anything?
[234:26.77]This is the highest rated thing.
[234:29.49]We already saw a version of this, didn't we?
[234:31.42]Let's check out this one.
[234:34.72]Don't press anything.
[234:40.16]What is even happening?
[234:41.98]How would you even program this?
[234:57.85]Look at how, look at that, look at how close I am to falling on this fell.
[235:01.65]Coolest roller coaster.
[235:04.25]Smart.
[235:04.73]Wee.
[235:09.97]There's no way this person doesn't have an engineering degree.
[235:15.78]The person that made this level has a PhD in mechanical engineering.
[235:29.55]Alright.
[235:36.12]What else is there?
[235:37.28]How do you fail that?
[235:37.92]You just have to move?
[235:40.04]40% clear rate.
[235:40.86]That means like 60% of the people just were walking around trying to jump.
[235:46.96]Okay, this is don't press anything 2.
[235:49.12]It's by the same guy?
[235:49.82]Yeah, I think it's the same guy, right?
[235:56.87]Let's see how good the sequel is.
[236:02.18]Did I just see the cat paw?
[236:08.46]Okay, that was cool.
[236:09.76]That was really cool.
[236:16.63]What's that say?
[236:19.39]Does that guy have a dick?
[236:22.51]I'm pretty sure that's a dick.
[236:25.60]Otherwise, he has three hands.
[236:26.76]No, that was two arms.
[236:27.82]No, that makes sense.
[236:32.15]No, that's not.
[236:37.76]Party time.
[236:38.62]Bring the disco.
[236:40.28]Somebody come.
[236:41.02]Blue was never catching him.
[236:48.39]I didn't walk right there.
[236:51.81]Cool.
[236:57.95]I like those.
[236:58.41]Those are like watching a little short... Those are like watching a movie.
[237:00.96]It's like watching a little TV show.
[237:02.82]A Mario TV show.
[237:07.66]What else is there?
[237:09.40]Splatoon.
[237:12.76]This has a 60% clear rate.
[237:14.32]Let's play this one.
[237:15.89]Do I get to move in this one?
[237:17.39]Do I get to play the game in this one?
[237:19.95]We'll find out.
[237:22.79]You're a squid now.
[237:24.05]Now a little squid knows what it's like to be Mario.
[237:28.42]This guy likes text, huh?
[237:33.06]I really am a squid.
[237:35.68]So cute.
[237:37.70]LOL.
[237:37.84]Let's see what happens.
[237:41.02]There's so many text things.
[237:45.26]Did he draw that?
[237:48.47]This guy wrote like an entire comic book.
[237:56.53]This dude has a whole graphic novel in here.
[238:00.30]I don't even know.
[238:00.86]I'm going just the wrong way.
[238:02.48]I'm reading his... I'm stuck in here.
[238:05.94]I am stuck in here.
[238:06.56]I'm going to lose.
[238:07.20]I'm going to lose to the EuroSquid level.
[238:09.24]No, I'm not.
[238:14.00]I have the power of the cat to protect me.
[238:16.26]How does that one up?
[238:27.17]Wait, can I write a comment?
[238:30.73]How do I write a comment here?
[238:35.38]What's going on?
[238:40.28]Oh no, Bowser.
[238:41.08]Oh shit.
[238:44.00]Now there's an actual game here.
[238:51.11]I'm a spy.
[238:51.73]I'm just reading what the people are saying.
[238:54.03]Look at all those deaths.
[239:00.36]I need to write something.
[239:01.14]I need to write, like... I need to write... God, I'm just gonna write in all capitals.
[239:09.40]Thanks, of course.
[239:21.50]Well, I died in that one because I'm reading all the weird text.
[239:27.79]Don't touch the shrooms.
[239:31.97]Sonic 1?
[239:34.01]Alright, I gotta check this one out.
[239:37.09]This is apparently Sonic the Hedgehog.
[239:44.55]I should get that.
[239:50.49]Hold on a second.
[239:51.24]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[239:52.42]Go back.
[239:55.34]Sonic the Hedgehog is in the game.
[239:58.05]Did that dude upload that, or is that in this video game?
[240:02.46]That's Sonic the fucking Hedgehog in this game.
[240:07.62]I'm confused, but I don't know.
[240:10.90]I don't understand.
[240:11.98]That's interesting, to say the least.
[240:22.48]That's surprising.
[240:27.09]Oh, is it an amiibo?
[240:28.97]It's an amiibo.
[240:31.87]Oh.
[240:35.96]Here begins the memes.
[240:37.36]You are right about that.
[240:40.02]Oh, she wasn't rolling.
[240:43.92]Yeah, but I fell too.
[240:51.23]I hate the dude.
[240:52.03]Come on, step it up.
[240:55.14]It even has the ring sound, too.
[240:59.78]Yikes.
[241:02.52]I'm gonna jump on these things.
[241:09.60]Run!
[241:13.55]Okay.
[241:17.15]Did you just say Pac-Man is in this game?
[241:20.99]Pac-Man's in the game.
[241:23.17]Where is he?
[241:24.98]Where is he and how do I get him?
[241:29.02]That's unbelievable.
[241:30.48]How do I search?
[241:31.02]How do I search for Pac-Man?
[241:35.51]Metroid?
[241:37.47]Donkey Kong?
[241:39.37]No, no, no.
[241:39.91]Give me a Pac-Man level.
[241:43.53]Featured search.
[241:44.25]Here we go.
[241:44.75]Pac-Man.
[241:47.49]Pac-Man.
[241:51.26]Okay.
[241:51.46]Okay.
[241:54.20]Of course not found.
[241:56.90]Oh, this is... That's like a code.
[241:59.61]Like a friend code.
[242:07.79]Top right.
[242:15.12]Go get a Pac-Man, Amiibo.
[242:20.28]Let's look at some popular rankings here.
[242:24.44]Those are the two guys that have the most popular thing, huh?
[242:31.29]Mega Man's in it?
[242:32.53]That's really, really, really cool.
[242:33.59]Alright, what are some of these levels?
[242:39.22]Somebody was saying I should play a certain person's level.
[242:45.16]And I couldn't.
[242:45.70]I don't remember who it was.
[242:57.27]Whose levels were you guys all saying to play?
[243:00.01]Or somebody's?
[243:00.54]Was it this guy?
[243:02.86]Ross, this dude?
[243:04.88]Yeah, everyone was saying to play this guy's levels.
[243:07.82]Okay.
[243:12.04]We're gonna go with Please Dance.
[243:15.77]Sure, let's play Please Dance.
[243:24.19]Not bad.
[243:25.07]Get ready to dance.
[243:29.02]Hold on, make sure there's no secrets.
[243:32.08]I gotta make sure there's no secrets.
[243:33.24]That's a secret.
[243:35.40]Found it.
[243:36.72]Found the secret, I win.
[243:39.76]So did the 5,000 other people.
[243:47.22]Alright, let's just actually do the level.
[243:59.10]I can't get those pipe marks.
[244:01.02]Let's go.
[244:04.44]Is this it?
[244:09.10]Is this dance party with Yoshi?
[244:19.06]Alright.
[244:20.24]Okay.
[244:21.72]We did the dance party.
[244:24.98]How do I get out?
[244:29.59]I don't like that.
[244:30.11]I forgot Yoshi has that move.
[244:33.41]It'd be nice if I could, uh, do it.
[244:35.69]Actually, no, do this.
[244:41.39]I win.
[244:43.99]Alright, he's got a Pac-Man level.
[244:47.93]Where's his Pac-Man level?
[244:48.75]Because I'm going to have to buy a Pac-Man amiibo if that's in the game.
[245:06.17]Ultimate life form?
[245:07.21]Bowser's trap.
[245:11.43]Pac-Mario.
[245:14.69]Yes.
[245:16.73]Yes.
[245:23.45]Where is it?
[245:29.21]It's even the Pac-Man with the big nose.
[245:31.31]But he turns into a banana.
[245:35.90]That's so cool.
[245:36.70]Can he do anything else besides just stand there like an idiot?
[245:41.62]Alright, let's go.
[245:49.40]Oh, look at when he swims.
[245:50.63]That's so cool.
[245:54.09]I lost it already.
[245:54.89]I was too busy.
[245:57.09]I was too busy fanboying over Pac-Man.
[246:03.60]You know, when I first purchased this game, I thought that it was going to be extremely limited and not fun.
[246:14.52]This is pretty cool, though.
[246:15.88]Can't go down?
[246:16.44]What?
[246:17.80]What?
[246:36.24]You can press up.
[246:36.82]I just want to look at him one more time.
[246:41.35]Let me get it.
[246:41.99]Give me the Pac-Man.
[246:43.35]Kills out a fruit.
[246:46.25]That's awesome.
[246:48.45]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[247:04.72]Can I actually run into them?
[247:06.98]No.
[247:08.80]But whatever.
[247:14.65]Easy.
[247:15.75]Easy.
[247:22.95]I did it.
[247:23.27]Alright.
[247:27.86]Maybe one or two more and I'm probably going to hit the tip of the hat since tomorrow I've got to be up.
[247:33.18]I've got some work that's being done still.
[247:42.91]But thank you guys for coming out and witnessing my my very bad not good playing this game.
[247:56.36]It was fun though.
[247:58.99]There was a couple of points that I was getting super salty.
[248:03.97]Oh, wow.
[248:04.35]Someone's so salty.
[248:05.39]But it's fun.
[248:08.10]This is a great game.
[248:10.34]Highly recommend if you are into this kind of thing.
[248:14.20]It's really fun.
[248:16.26]We'll do one more.
[248:17.12]We'll do one more hard one.
[248:18.70]And I'll try it like five or ten times or something.
[248:24.72]Like courses.
[248:25.26]I'm going to try to beat that one that was giving me trouble before.
[248:32.72]This one?
[248:33.06]This is the one with the 2% clear rate.
[248:40.26]Alright.
[248:40.60]Let's try to remember how this worked.
[248:42.74]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[248:43.60]Mr. Chomps.
[248:43.98]At least I don't have a set amount of lives here.
[249:06.89]That's what I should have done from the very beginning.
[249:11.85]Well, that's something I had to press.
[249:18.92]We didn't get you to put a fork in the outlet.
[249:21.26]No we didn't.
[249:21.76]We did not.
[249:29.99]Also, this is my first time I've ever streamed on a console.
[249:34.58]So I have to work out the bugs and all the, you know, kinks and stuff.
[249:39.42]Because there were quite a few of them, unfortunately.
[249:42.02]I'm going to wait until they both up.
[249:45.45]Come on, jump up there.
[249:46.61]Join your friend.
[249:47.73]Shit, I would have gone through.
[250:02.68]I also gotta figure out that delay.
[250:06.68]Not just the random weird input delay I'm feeling, but the delay with the audio that was happening.
[250:14.44]Oh, shit.
[250:20.16]Some people have said that there's been a couple of flashes.
[250:22.68]Like it just flashed once or twice.
[250:26.18]Audio delay for some people.
[250:27.86]I'll figure it out.
[250:32.82]I hope.
[250:33.18]I should have waited.
[250:39.56]I should have waited.
[250:40.50]I can stand right there and be totally fine.
[250:42.15]If I stand right there, they won't hit me with any of their crap.
[250:48.15]Waited too long.
[250:48.69]I actually think I'll be able to get this.
[250:52.19]I think I'll be able to beat this one.
[250:53.45]I warmed up enough and I played enough of this game.
[250:57.31]After a few minutes, I should be able to get this.
[251:11.90]I was looking over to the right, just trying to get the opportunity to run.
[251:20.93]Yeah, I'm going to try that this time.
[251:23.33]I'm going to try to jump and hit them underneath.
[251:26.51]Seems like a good idea.
[251:34.54]Oh, I can't.
[251:35.08]I cannot hit them.
[251:36.18]But I'm in a safe spot.
[251:39.42]No, they jumped down.
[251:40.34]I forgot.
[251:42.61]See, that just kind of threw a cog into my brain when I couldn't hit them from underneath.
[251:48.03]I just assumed I was safe for some reason.
[251:52.67]I'm gonna be one of those 2%.
[251:58.01]I will be one of those 2.7% people.
[252:17.20]Come on down.
[252:18.36]They threw too many.
[252:19.62]Now I'm in deep shit.
[252:21.43]I'm in deep shit.
[252:44.59]I'm just like locked in right now.
[252:46.53]I... I did... I was hypnotized.
[252:50.95]I was under legit hypnosis right there.
[252:52.71]I didn't know... I feel like I was at a magic show.
[253:01.48]You gotta go right... Now.
[253:11.18]Holy dog shit.
[253:12.20]Okay.
[253:12.50]Need to wait till the end of that thing.
[253:14.66]I will be in the 2.7%.
[253:19.73]I'm gonna do it.
[253:21.25]I'm gonna do it.
[253:25.29]Now I know that happens at the end.
[253:26.37]I'm gonna do it.
[253:26.95]There we are.
[253:34.74]Wait for the one to fly up there.
[253:44.18]Shit I could have gone up could have gone up Could have gone up That's the worst part when you play through these levels They're like kind of you have to memorize things and you see something right at the very end I saw that right at the very end that I could have probably got a mushroom there.
[254:03.13]I Don't think I have a good opportunity anymore Maybe right now
[254:14.73]Nope.
[254:15.83]Right.
[254:17.33]Did they just throw way more than usual?
[254:21.00]Get out of here.
[254:24.62]Oh, you gotta be shitting me right now.
[254:35.76]You've got to be absolutely shitting me.
[254:37.70]I'm... I'm very, very mad at that one.
[254:41.22]I should've hit him right in the fucking crown of his head.
[254:45.16]That one was perfect.
[254:47.62]And then, of course, it all goes to hell.
[254:50.15]Like it typically does.
[254:51.13]I really want to stop this from moving.
[254:52.93]It came out further than I thought.
[255:11.69]I actually really should not have even... I shouldn't have even attacked that guy.
[255:14.81]That was just an extremely stupid move.
[255:24.08]I'm gonna get it.
[255:26.58]I have to get this before I go to bed.
[255:28.38]That's extremely important.
[255:42.43]Guy throws a perfect pitch down the middle right there.
[255:45.32]Damn, this is fucking hard as shit.
[255:51.82]I didn't mean to do that.
[256:20.80]I should have kept running!
[256:21.82]It's actually surprising that only 3% of every person that's played this has beaten it.
[256:30.63]That's kind of funny.
[256:33.27]You'd think it'd be a lot more.
[256:48.65]I should've just jumped again.
[256:49.57]This one's the fireballs that just get annoying.
[256:55.04]And here comes Allah, Kitu, whatever his name is.
[257:19.07]You know, drop down.
[257:20.53]Let me get you.
[257:21.15]What the hell was that?
[257:25.12]What did he just do?
[257:27.86]No, I gotta move.
[257:29.84]It's not gonna happen.
[257:30.54]I'm gonna watch you.
[257:37.62]I'm just overcomplicating things when I get there.
[257:42.43]Massively just overcomplicating the shit out of that every time I get there.
[257:48.84]I just need to jump as soon as I get over there.
[257:51.32]Jump, jump, jump, and get up and kill him.
[257:53.95]Because he's such a pain in the ass at that part.
[257:56.51]Because he's throwing shit down when things are coming up.
[258:03.25]I literally was reading chat.
[258:05.89]My face is just down.
[258:10.84]Oh, this is very possible.
[258:13.64]But you just need to do everything perfect.
[258:17.18]At least close to it.
[258:24.19]I missed it.
[258:25.37]That just threw me off big time.
[258:26.93]Get double teamed.
[258:34.95]You want some of this too?
[258:37.05]No, no, no.
[258:37.69]What am I thinking?
[258:38.23]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[258:41.16]Just watch him.
[258:42.00]Watch out for that.
[258:44.14]Here comes another one.
[258:44.92]He's going to throw it down right now.
[258:47.20]I can't even...
[258:51.07]I just, I just, I haven't gotten there in a long time.
[258:53.25]I have, I just got, I forgot that that's what, yeah, I forgot.
[258:56.51]I just 100% forgot that it was like that.
[259:00.50]I don't know why.
[259:01.46]I'm getting tired.
[259:03.40]I'm getting fucking tired.
[259:07.56]You tell when you're getting tired when you're forgetting things that happened like three minutes ago.
[259:14.25]That's when you know you're sleeping.
[259:19.41]God, stop throwing so many.
[259:20.91]I hate when they do that shit.
[259:24.23]Yeah, you can take the cloud, but it's getting up there is the issue.
[259:29.71]Because all the flames that are coming up and he's throwing shit down.
[259:33.62]All the while you're trying to do those jumps and avoid getting hit.
[259:37.90]It's just a lot for your brain to have to do at the same time.
[259:43.62]Oh my god.
[259:50.90]Yeah, you can go the easy way, but... I feel like I've been doing it this way so much, and I'm somewhat reliably getting past the Hammer Brothers.
[260:00.41]Until very recently.
[260:04.14]I'm getting too sloppy.
[260:10.18]So I figured out why only 3% of people have ever beaten this level.
[260:14.55]I figured it out.
[260:15.85]Here's what it is.
[260:17.71]You do it, like, this many times, and then you just go like this.
[260:21.51]I don't fucking care.
[260:23.29]And you quit.
[260:25.37]We're not gonna do that, though.
[260:35.33]I have to beat this to go to bed.
[260:36.83]This is my sleep ticket.
[260:39.65]You know, because this is my sleep ticket, I'm just gonna go this way.
[260:42.83]Fuck it, who cares.
[260:47.53]Just forget what happened.
[260:48.83]You don't even skip the Hammer Brothers over here.
[260:50.95]That actually was more work to do that.
[261:04.92]Yeah, forget that.
[261:06.02]It's not easier going that way.
[261:07.28]It's just longer.
[261:09.26]I mean, you get the mushroom, but... I'll probably just try to get it over with.
[261:22.90]There's like no opportunity to jump through that.
[261:28.08]The opportunity to go through there is so small.
[261:31.72]Maybe it is.
[261:32.17]Yeah, it is.
[261:32.71]I'm just going to die.
[261:36.51]I'm going to get the mushroom.
[261:39.15]Because the 2% chance to get through those hammer brothers is seriously not fucking worth it.
[261:45.85]I can just go through it every time if I just take this.
[262:02.40]I gotta remember where they are, where they come up.
[262:03.96]Ah, fuck.
[262:06.64]If I didn't break that, I wouldn't have freaked out about it.
[262:12.53]He has to die.
[262:14.55]Immediately.
[262:15.61]Otherwise, it's never gonna happen.
[262:17.98]Like, right when I get down here, and I get past the Hammer Brothers, this dude's gotta die.
[262:25.04]Like, the second he's able to.
[262:26.60]Shit.
[262:27.48]Shit.
[262:36.38]Oh, it's 3% of attempts, not 3% of people.
[262:39.10]Well, still, that's still a fucking tiny number.
[262:42.86]That's even worse.
[262:43.62]3% of attempts means that there's potentially, like, thousands of attempts of this level.
[262:55.53]That one has hit me so many times, I just keep trying to get through.
[263:01.13]How did he get this level again?
[263:02.21]I want to beat it before I go to sleep.
[263:06.03]Fucking difficult ass shithead level.
[263:07.95]I'm not getting the mushroom this time.
[263:11.24]Whatever.
[263:11.82]I'm gonna do it with pure luck.
[263:15.18]No, I'm in trouble now.
[263:17.60]I am in trouble.
[263:18.26]I had to go there, but those stupid flames.
[263:20.14]Ah, the flames, man.
[263:21.14]Alright, it's time to go.
[263:22.26]Nope.
[263:40.03]Yeah, I played the level with a 0% clear rate.
[263:42.11]That sucked.
[263:42.93]I was on it for like an hour and 12 minutes.
[263:49.13]That level fucking ate shit.
[263:53.42]Alright, he's gonna... I don't know.
[264:01.18]I don't know what happened.
[264:02.98]Why did I do like a little jump there?
[264:05.28]I just got like stuck on the P thing?
[264:07.38]What the fuck was that?
[264:10.85]That should not have happened.
[264:11.95]Jumping over that ship.
[264:13.49]Oh, I've screwed that up.
[264:14.93]Let's get it.
[264:45.01]There's not much more after this, though.
[264:46.49]I mean, there's a little bit, but not a whole lot.
[264:49.69]No, I was gonna go right there.
[264:51.45]That was a good opportunity.
[264:53.27]Whatever.
[264:53.89]Screw it.
[264:54.48]Just go.
[264:55.10]God.
[265:19.70]Those flames are in a position where they're extremely difficult to avoid because you have to land there it seems.
[265:27.62]Get over here.
[265:30.40]Fuck you.
[265:32.92]Fuck everything you stand for.
[265:34.36]I don't have to worry about that guy anymore.
[265:56.93]I just have no opportunities to go anywhere.
[265:59.35]Oh, it's again.
[266:00.05]It hit me again.
[266:00.56]Oh, I blew it already.
[266:06.48]Oh, I'm okay.
[266:10.06]I seriously didn't even mean to do that.
[266:13.24]That looks down again.
[266:27.15]This shit is gonna try to be fucking crazy.
[266:31.54]I'm going to legit lose my fucking mind playing this game.
[266:37.72]I'm gonna wait for this dumb shithead to come back.
[266:39.88]Fuck your cloud.
[266:44.26]I could get in it, but I keep killing him in the worst possible spot.
[266:52.37]Well, I didn't hold down B long enough.
[266:55.43]I'm just unraveling at this point.
[267:07.00]I gotta kill him right here.
[267:10.43]It's actually gonna... Wait, wait, this is... What the fuck?
[267:14.39]Star?
[267:14.69]There's a star in there?
[267:29.54]Are you serious?
[267:31.76]I'm getting that.
[267:32.32]That's actually kind of hard to get.
[267:33.70]Oh, dear.
[267:33.94]Okay, I know where to jump.
[267:35.09]That's right.
[267:35.65]No.
[267:35.91]Mm, close.
[268:04.32]That moment when you realize what the chat's been saying forever.
[268:07.44]Well, it's kind of hard to see chat because it's on my eye.
[268:10.06]Because I'm facing away from my computer right now.
[268:13.70]So I have my iPad sitting on my lap right now.
[268:17.42]That's how I'm reading chat because I'm facing away from my desk.
[268:23.08]I've got to figure this pattern out.
[268:26.36]I thought it was like that.
[268:28.84]It is.
[268:29.08]I just have to go faster.
[268:33.32]I could, yeah, I could just get the mushroom, too.
[268:35.76]I'll try that.
[268:37.59]Just jump up and get it.
[268:42.31]Let's try that.
[268:48.07]Um... Yeah, I'm definitely getting way too tired to play this game.
[268:53.64]I was looking for the blue thing to jump on.
[268:56.16]That's, like, how, like, just tired and just done playing this game I am.
[269:01.16]I'm sleepy as all shit.
[269:04.54]Okay, we're here.
[269:05.64]No more excuses.
[269:06.57]Let's go.
[269:25.93]Hey, can you guys guess what happened there?
[269:27.43]I forgot about the end again.
[269:29.61]Because I hadn't been there in so long.
[269:32.45]But that's easy enough to do.
[269:35.92]I've been streaming for like six hours or something, haven't I?
[269:38.26]Thank god, my brain's gonna explode.
[269:41.14]I'm so fucking tired.
[269:42.82]I just want to be done with it.
[269:44.80]I'm so sleepy.
[270:04.88]I got a fucking long day tomorrow, too.
[270:08.55]I gotta wake up- I gotta wake up at like 7 o'clock in the morning.
[270:11.49]There's like a construction guy gonna be here, and then tip of the hats is all day.
[270:18.75]What am I- Why am I doing this right now?
[270:20.64]I have like extremely important busy things to do tomorrow, and I'm playing a 3% completion rate fucking Mario Maker game.
[270:31.06]Like, what the hell am I doing?
[270:40.72]Oh, God, I hit the wall.
[270:41.90]Fuck.
[270:52.34]I'm just, like, one eye is closed and shit.
[270:54.78]Okay, wake up.
[270:55.70]Wake the fuck up.
[270:56.66]It's time.
[270:57.26]It's time to get this, like, done.
[271:00.26]Get there.
[271:00.74]Who cares?
[271:01.38]Just get through that.
[271:02.36]No, I just... I'm gonna frisbee my iPad into my wall.
[271:09.28]I'm going to take a fucking professional frisbee move.
[271:13.80]And it's going straight through the drywall.
[271:16.37]I'll never find it.
[271:17.33]It's just going to go in.
[271:18.07]I'll never find it again.
[271:18.87]I'm not going to
[271:40.78]Alright, let's slow it down.
[271:43.13]Kill this fucking asshole.
[271:46.55]Oh, he flew away from me.
[271:47.49]Oh my god.
[271:51.93]What an iPad gamer.
[271:53.27]I've just... Remember when I was making the level?
[272:01.50]Why did I decide to do it?
[272:02.64]I don't know why I decided to do this level.
[272:05.48]I wanted to do this for some dumb reason.
[272:08.72]And this is so easy too, it's just I'm so done.
[272:15.35]I was done like two hours ago.
[272:17.23]Fuck you, give me your cloud.
[272:28.53]Get outta here.
[272:31.40]Get me out of the cloud.
[272:34.70]Mario, please get out of the cloud.
[272:46.65]This is, this is, this is more to, this is a lot more.
[272:55.87]Come on, come over here.
[272:58.07]Shouldn't have gotten that tall.
[273:04.91]Oh my god.
[273:09.34]That's the end right there.
[273:10.52]That is literally the end.
[273:11.66]That's the first time I'd ever seen that.
[273:15.99]At least I know that's the end.
[273:19.87]I have no idea what's happening there, but I know it's the end.
[273:22.19]Because it has the knife there.
[273:23.67]The big knife.
[273:24.51]Here we go again.
[273:25.34]Whoa, what?
[273:25.66]What's this?
[273:47.50]Uh, yeah, I'll take that.
[273:48.86]Absolutely.
[273:50.43]Alright, here we go again.
[273:58.03]This one wasn't terrible.
[274:00.35]Although, how am I supposed to get through this without getting hit?
[274:02.90]Besides, like, jumping up?
[274:05.24]And jumping up.
[274:06.64]Yeah, that's how you do it.
[274:08.20]Okay, I don't know what this guy does.
[274:16.11]Wait, what?
[274:17.92]Do I have to get him to hit into this wall?
[274:22.36]I just need to know if that's what's happening or not.
[274:26.22]Don't worry, I died there intentionally.
[274:27.86]I was just trying to figure out what the hell he does.
[274:30.42]I'm going to assume that that's what it is.
[274:53.88]Get that again.
[274:54.52]Alright, what the fuck does that guy do?
[275:01.86]Whoa, what the hell?
[275:02.48]What's this?
[275:04.62]Oh, God!
[275:06.36]That's the level being completed right there.
[275:09.25]Okay.
[275:09.99]I just didn't even realize what the hell was happening.
[275:18.79]I'm just gonna push the P block...
[275:27.32]Oh, I get it.
[275:28.38]Okay, I get it.
[275:30.36]I see.
[275:31.02]Alright, I understand now.
[275:31.98]I understand.
[275:36.23]I understand.
[275:37.05]It's just the P blocks just keep falling.
[275:40.49]I get it.
[275:40.83]You just gotta keep hitting them.
[275:43.81]Makes sense.
[275:44.61]Makes sense.
[275:46.11]That's the first time I've died to that guy.
[275:48.78]For obvious reasons.
[276:06.15]Be nice to take the three hits too.
[276:07.55]I have no idea what the fuck I was doing there.
[276:14.77]Nothing smart, that's for sure.
[276:22.79]Nothing smart, that is for sure.
[276:24.39]Don't take unnecessary damage for no reason, please.
[276:38.36]Let's not mess this up.
[276:39.66]Come on.
[276:40.34]I'm waiting for the fire.
[276:41.36]I actually shouldn't have stepped on that.
[276:43.95]That was stupid.
[277:08.35]Well, fire, fire, fire.
[277:23.19]Ah, the fire.
[277:23.79]I forgot about the fucking fire again.
[277:34.60]I thought he was going up.
[277:37.03]I really seriously thought he was going up and not coming straight down like that.
[277:43.35]Well, I got both their patterns.
[277:45.27]This should be over very soon.
[277:48.98]And I use that term very, very loosely.
[277:51.36]And then I can go to bed.
[278:02.33]I overshot that, big time.
[278:07.14]Ah, fuck.
[278:09.34]That was very close.
[278:10.54]That was unnecessarily close.
[278:15.19]That was extremely unnecessary.
[278:16.61]Okay, wipe the hands down.
[278:26.27]Wipe the hands down.
[278:27.15]Just be easy.
[278:31.33]There's no reason to sprint around all over the place.
[278:33.21]They have very, very, very manageable patterns.
[278:40.98]This lasts a long time easy peasy I didn't know when the fire was happening
[279:12.30]Fire, fuck no!
[279:16.18]God damn it.
[279:18.12]So fucking tedious.
[279:23.78]You know, I died in the exact same spot as the last time.
[279:32.17]You have to do that like six times.
[279:34.15]That sucks.
[279:39.39]Dude, look at how I've just become so, like, mesmerized that I'm just doing this.
[279:43.96]I'm not even playing the game right now.
[279:45.60]My muscle memory is doing this part again.
[279:47.84]I'm gonna beat this, guys.
[279:54.33]Don't worry.
[280:01.25]Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.
[280:05.00]about the secret door there's no secret door that secret door is not real it's the fire that's screwing me up let's keep remember these two are don't forget about the fire I'm gonna get hit yeah I'm in deep now
[280:44.39]Alright.
[280:49.03]It's just the random, random, random, random, random directions that they go.
[280:52.57]You just have to go, it's in the fire too.
[280:58.92]So close.
[281:00.44]I'm so close to just beating this.
[281:12.03]I'm so glad I don't have to do this anymore.
[281:13.75]I can try to get better at the, uh, next part.
[281:18.52]Pick, pick the flower up, you dumbass.
[281:22.32]God, do I have to be such a dumbass sometimes?
[281:24.46]Seriously.
[281:30.87]I'll get it, right?
[281:31.53]Oh, I misforgot.
[281:32.17]For a second I thought that was it right there.
[281:34.59]Alright, I need to move.
[281:35.29]I need to, I'm putting the iPad down.
[281:37.17]Get this shit off my lap.
[281:39.11]Let me sit forward.
[281:41.71]Let's go
[282:31.92]Fuck you, game.
[282:33.56]God, that was...
[282:57.39]So, uh... You guys... You guys ready to go to bed?
[283:02.63]Oh, boy.
[283:07.72]Yay!
[283:11.98]I beat Mr. Chomp's doghouse.
[283:25.09]Let's see.
[283:25.91]What do the people say?
[283:26.81]What do the people say?
[283:28.04]Let's see what they say.
[283:38.02]He said... Uh... Murder.
[283:46.57]Thank you.
[283:47.01]You just killed my Mario 100 run, but nice level.
[283:54.11]See you in 15 years.
[283:55.13]Fun.
[283:56.15]Awesome.
[283:56.61]Final boss.
[283:58.11]Go up if you want to have an easier time.
[283:59.65]This poor guy.
[284:03.33]This poor guy got his 100 run killed.
[284:07.64]Okay.
[284:08.04]Well, there is the number if you need it.
[284:14.78]That was really cool.
[284:16.21]That was really fun.
[284:18.77]If you think that tortured is fun.
[284:28.25]by Cuddly.
[284:32.16]Alright, guys.
[284:34.40]It's funny.
[284:34.86]Now that I look back at this level, it's actually very, very easy once you know exactly what's happening.
[284:42.08]But that's the problem with all these levels.
[284:44.09]I died a million times on things that I just didn't understand.
[284:48.09]I just want to see one thing.
[284:59.26]Oh, this is a featured... one shell.
[285:07.37]Yeah, it's funny.
[285:12.77]Looking back, I'm like, how did I not beat that on my first try?
[285:15.87]You have no idea what the hell's going on, and shit's flying all over the place.
[285:21.63]This is a really fun game, though.
[285:22.65]Look at this one.
[285:23.59]Look at this level.
[285:24.59]What is even happening here?
[285:26.55]I'm... This is not... I'm not attempting to beat this or anything.
[285:29.29]I'm just curious.
[285:30.39]I just want to see what it is.
[285:34.88]There's a dude here.
[285:47.85]Okay, that leads to nothing.
[285:53.81]I'm kind of confused by this level.
[285:57.89]Can I fit in here?
[286:00.36]Oh shit, okay.
[286:01.62]Ugh.
[286:19.35]Alright, guys.
[286:20.79]I'm gonna take off.
[286:22.11]Thanks for watching.
[286:23.93]If you're new, if you just found this stream, I'm real fucking goddamn sorry.
[286:30.55]That you had to watch that maybe fail miserably over and over again at this game.
[286:34.55]Yeah.
[286:37.08]Hi, my name's Jerma.
[286:40.98]For the rest of you.
[286:42.54]Take these guys.
[286:43.64]See most of you at Tip of the Hats tomorrow.
[286:46.24]I think I'll be there at either 1 or 4, I think, is when I'm going to be starting on it.
[286:56.95]But yeah, goodnight guys.
[286:58.33]Have a wonderful, wonderful evening.
[287:00.31]Rest of your night, rest of your day, whatever, wherever you are.
[287:03.30]Goodnight.
[287:04.14]Goodbye.
[287:04.58]Goodbye.
