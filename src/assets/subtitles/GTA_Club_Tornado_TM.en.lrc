[00:00.07]Shout out to the people.
[00:01.61]Shout out to all those back home.
[00:03.41]Hey mom, there's a new nightclub!
[00:05.20]Club Tornado!
[00:05.94]I have to get there now!
[00:09.08]We've done the establishing transition shot, so now I'm here at Club Tornado.
[00:13.06]That's how you can tell that I traveled to get here.
[00:14.56]There's people throwing up outside.
[00:16.79]Probably because Club Tornado is that amazing of a place.
[00:20.61]Fun is measured in vomit.
[00:21.93]You get off a rollercoaster, you fun.
[00:24.29]It was fun.
[00:24.91]Get the fuck out of my way.
[00:27.84]Is this it?
[00:30.15]I don't get it.
[00:30.65]This is just like any other club.
[00:43.22]No, we're leaving.
[00:44.18]We don't like this club.
[00:45.46]Yeah, this club sucks.
[00:46.62]Club Tornado?
[00:47.55]You guys been there?
[00:48.53]Daisy, don't fucking come to Club Tornado.
[00:50.79]It's not even cool.
[00:51.73]It's kind of cool.
[00:52.97]I like it.
[00:58.42]There's a monster pulling a guy under the table.
[01:04.25]He's sitting down.
[01:05.81]No, he's not.
[01:06.29]He's... Watch out.
[01:17.74]Watch out.
[01:18.16]Watch out.
[01:24.28]10 people just get fucking thrown around by a tornado?
[01:26.57]This is a good feat, man.
[01:29.05]That guy is on fire being an impressive motherfucker right now.
[01:32.95]Alright, it's good to go out.
[01:34.05]Don't worry about it.
[01:34.63]Yeah, I'm good.
[01:36.37]Oh, yeah, baby.
[01:37.89]You like my dance moves?
[01:39.09]I learned these dance moves from TV.
[01:42.25]I don't ever get out.
[01:43.07]I never do anything.
[01:43.83]Let's go in the bathroom and make out or something.
[02:01.48]I can't believe that just happened.
[02:04.60]I'm done.
[02:06.22]I'm fucking done.
[02:07.88]Another episode like that and I'm gonna shit my pants.
[02:09.70]This guy, please.
[02:20.72]No!
[02:21.36]No!
[02:21.68]Damn it.
[02:22.40]Oh, that filled up.
[02:41.92]Club Tornado.
[02:45.16]What the fuck happened?
[02:46.99]Ever since I made that video about Club Tornado, this place just sucks now.
[02:50.83]It's not even worth coming back here.
[02:52.67]This is pathetic.
[02:54.75]I'm leaving the worst review I can leave.
[03:01.58]No!
[03:02.02]No!
[03:02.88]What have I done?
[03:05.56]Why would you do this?
[03:07.14]I don't want to dance with this dusty old bird.
[03:18.23]Well, if that club's ruined, let's try this knockoff, like, imitation club tornado.
[03:27.03]Already.
[03:28.67]Oh, my God.
[03:30.49]Everyone, just look at these guys just standing around looking at you.
[03:35.68]Get me out of this dude corner.
[03:37.24]This isn't even a tornado.
[03:38.28]There's just a bunch of guys just like stuck up in the ceiling.
[03:40.80]This is just club vacuum.
[03:43.63]Come on, you can't be giving zebras alcohol because then they just throw up out of their chest.
[03:48.19]Everybody knows this.
[03:49.31]That's why there's the law.
[03:50.17]You don't serve bearded zebras.
[03:53.36]Someone's got to put a stop to this and there's only one thing that can stop this and I think you all know what it is.
[04:09.61]It was a pretty good night out.
