[00:06.24]Hello.
[00:07.18]Hello.
[00:08.78]I'm Andy.
[00:09.54]I'm Andy.
[00:10.32]I'm always a late Andy.
[00:12.22]I'm Landy.
[00:13.00]I'm Andy.
[00:13.76]I'm always late Andy.
[00:15.77]I just like mess that up.
[00:16.81]Whatever.
[00:17.33]I practiced that for like 10 minutes.
[00:19.65]I was in the mirror practicing that for an hour.
[00:22.63]Minus 50 minutes.
[00:26.23]Landy.
[00:28.73]Is this an ad?
[00:29.99]Well, hold on.
[00:32.43]Not yet.
[00:36.10]Landy.
[00:39.90]We're going to play two things today.
[00:41.06]We're going to play Cult of the Lamb.
[00:43.60]It's out.
[00:44.04]It's out today, right?
[00:45.96]Or is it yesterday?
[00:48.18]Yesterday.
[00:50.82]Oh, spoiler.
[00:51.73]You know, I don't want you to hear the music.
[00:55.13]When you stream in an hour, I'm kind of busy.
[00:56.91]Well...
[00:59.70]I was supposed to start an hour ago.
[01:01.46]Pre-stream chat knows.
[01:03.70]I made it 3 o'clock so I could go, oh man, hey, I'm live at 2.
[01:08.38]And then I had to make a few very important phone calls and that didn't work.
[01:19.15]Hey, but it's okay.
[01:20.11]I only turned out to be like 12, 10 minutes late rather than an hour and 10 minutes late.
[01:25.33]So it's a good thing I didn't make it 2 o'clock, right?
[01:29.19]Now you're thinking with portals.
[01:31.57]No, but how you doing?
[01:32.47]Welcome back.
[01:35.51]Today we're going to be playing Cult of the Lamb.
[01:39.59]Like I said earlier.
[01:43.09]Should be fun.
[01:43.73]I've heard very, very good things.
[01:45.32]I've heard people say that this is probably one of the better games that's come out this whole year.
[01:52.02]The Twitch extension works.
[01:53.14]It's just very, very slow.
[01:56.03]I'll turn that on another time.
[01:58.09]Once it's good to go.
[02:00.78]Because I'm probably going to be playing this again.
[02:05.82]I didn't set that up if I had to.
[02:09.26]Because they turned it off, they turned it on, they updated it, they turned it off.
[02:12.21]I'm going to wait until it's good to go.
[02:14.19]But yeah, we're going to play that for a little while and then we're going to move to Two Point Campus.
[02:23.75]Which is going to be a sponsored part of the stream.
[02:25.63]So, Cult of the Lamb not sponsored.
[02:28.11]Two Point Campus is sponsored.
[02:31.44]I'm going to do a half and half today.
[02:32.68]This game is so good.
[02:36.04]I'm going in completely blind here.
[02:37.84]I can't wait.
[02:38.24]I'm going to say my mic is on.
[02:47.30]Your mic is picking up the music from the game.
[02:50.82]It is absolutely not.
[02:53.72]Is it?
[02:55.14]Hold on a second.
[03:00.47]No, it isn't.
[03:04.99]No, you're full of shit.
[03:09.74]Your mic is picking up several dangerous pathogens.
[03:12.96]What do you mean?
[03:16.30]It's doing it?
[03:17.00]Hold on.
[03:17.74]What?
[03:21.10]Wait, when I talk, you can hear it.
[03:24.20]What do you mean by that?
[03:26.96]It comes in when you talk.
[03:29.48]Huh?
[03:32.10]Hold on, wait, we have to do a test.
[03:34.74]So you're saying that if I keep the microphone open and have the noise gate not come through, you hear the music.
[03:47.35]What?
[03:47.61]What?
[03:51.08]I have absolutely no idea why that's happening.
[03:53.52]Hold on.
[03:53.90]Does it fix it?
[03:59.43]No, that's not even the right mic.
[04:02.93]I am so confused.
[04:06.63]Funny mic.
[04:07.45]What do you mean funny mic?
[04:11.31]That's the webcam.
[04:12.75]Hold on.
[04:15.45]What happened?
[04:17.61]Why is it doing that?
[04:21.23]I have no response to this.
[04:22.71]Hold on.
[04:27.21]Okay, I don't want... Um... Tell me if this fixes it.
[04:37.34]Did that fix it?
[04:38.22]Or is it still happening?
[04:40.86]Uh... Uh... It's not there?
[04:48.08]Don't ask.
[04:48.88]I just turned off literally everything.
[04:52.28]But answer me this.
[04:54.86]You do hear it now though, right?
[04:58.51]Scream into your webcam.
[05:01.81]Okay, we're good.
[05:03.71]I might not do face cam.
[05:05.23]I have unbrushed teeth today and I haven't taken a shower or anything.
[05:10.49]So I look like a fucking just gross person.
[05:13.81]I don't know.
[05:14.15]I might not have cam on today.
[05:16.00]I have really unbrushed teeth.
[05:18.92]I'm just telling you.
[05:19.80]That's a fact.
[05:23.34]All right, I'm ready to play.
[05:26.28]You want to see, should we see what I look like?
[05:32.74]I'm telling you, I have wicked bad unbrushed teeth.
[05:37.06]I know this sounds like an annoying thing where I turn the cam on and I look fine.
[05:43.31]I look great.
[05:45.53]But I just tell you, oh, I haven't showered.
[05:47.53]I haven't brushed my teeth.
[05:48.33]So everyone goes, oh, but you look so good, right?
[05:53.67]How do I look?
[05:57.15]I woke up like this and I didn't change it.
[06:00.07]How do I look?
[06:04.13]How do my teeth look?
[06:09.55]Literally no one could have... Look at my hair though.
[06:14.78]This is called my head was mushed into the pillow.
[06:19.44]This is like I'm sleepy.
[06:25.74]It's not balding.
[06:27.42]Who cares if I'm bald?
[06:30.04]Why is my webcam flickering like there's a candle in front of me?
[06:35.17]Guys, if I go bald, whatever.
[06:37.41]I'm almost 40, okay?
[06:39.63]If I go bald, that's a normal human reaction to getting older is balding a little.
[06:45.13]I turn 40 soon.
[06:46.91]If I go bald, who cares?
[06:50.53]I made it a long time with all this hair.
[06:53.15]I don't even care.
[06:56.14]You look good for a guy that's in a zombie movie.
[06:58.42]Alright, well, it's coming off for now.
[07:00.24]If you're good, it'll come back.
[07:02.40]You have to be good, though.
[07:03.30]Good, though!
[07:04.16]Oh my goodness.
[07:11.39]That might have been the worst one yet.
[07:13.81]That might have been the worst one in a decade.
[07:19.25]Hold on, I gotta turn this down.
[07:21.73]Why did my GoXLR change all of its settings?
[07:23.47]That was weird.
[07:30.20]Because this is routing the wrong way.
[07:31.96]Whatever.
[07:32.28]It's fine.
[07:34.38]Okay.
[07:35.02]Here we go.
[07:35.56]Call to the Lamb.
[07:36.70]I'm ready to play.
[07:37.98]It should be fun.
[07:40.00]Oh, your face came on?
[07:40.78]I will if you're good.
[07:44.03]You gotta be good.
[07:48.31]You're aging backwards and... Praise the Lamb.
[07:55.21]Conduit to great power.
[07:56.69]Almost...
[07:59.53]The sacrificial beast take heed for a crown cannot sit upon two brows.
[08:03.59]Alright.
[08:08.91]All you had to tell me there was XXXXXXX YYY BBB. XXXXX YYYYY BBB. That's all you had to say. XXXXXXX YYY BBB.
[08:35.37]This game was in the... If you don't remember, this game was part of the Steam Demo Day week.
[08:42.57]And it was one of our favorites.
[08:44.17]So I'm really glad to be playing it right now.
[08:48.62]Where's my precious streamer space?
[08:50.84]If you're good, you have to be good.
[08:52.94]Hmm.
[09:02.91]Before us stands the last of its kind, all others we have hunted down and put to the blade.
[09:09.55]With this final sacrifice, the prophecy will be impossible to fulfill.
[09:12.80]The heretic who lies bound below will be condemned to eternal captivity, and the old faith shall be preserved.
[09:39.94]So I'm dead.
[09:42.52]This is the eternal being that's been chained down here for centuries.
[09:50.19]Over 200 years.
[09:51.71]Come closer, fear not, for though you are already dead, I still have need of you.
[09:57.87]Those foolish bishops thought they could keep you from me in death, but instead they sent you straight to me.
[10:05.95]I will give you life again, but at a price.
[10:11.84]All I ask is you start a cult in my name.
[10:13.90]Do we have a deal?
[10:15.44]Yes, sure.
[10:24.71]And so it came to pass that the Countess once bathed in the rejuvenating blood.
[10:31.77]I've never heard the rest of that dialogue, by the way.
[10:34.71]I've always pressed click right after that part.
[10:40.81]Alright, let's go.
[10:43.52]XXXXX YYY BBB.
[10:53.52]I forgot how fun this game was.
[10:54.52]This game is like okay- It's kinda like Binding of Isaac. Kinda like Legend of Zelda.
[11:00.50]Kinda like-
[11:09.50]Startropics.
[11:12.50]It's kinda like frickin' Morty.
[11:14.88]Not.
[11:17.28]Like Dark Souls?
[11:17.98]I don't think so.
[11:25.69]Fear not, I am Ratau.
[11:27.47]I was once a chosen vessel like you, but those days are lost to the winds.
[11:33.79]I was sent to guide you.
[11:34.77]We are deep in the lands of the Old Faith and in grave danger.
[11:39.30]My instructions are to lead you to safety.
[11:40.94]Continue through the woods.
[11:41.88]Escape lies ahead.
[11:42.78]I will be close by.
[11:43.74]Sick.
[11:45.20]Is this your fucking house?
[11:47.60]Is this like Dark Souls?
[11:58.13]It's a little bit like Dark Souls.
[11:59.35]A little bit like Rick and Morty.
[12:09.18]I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[12:13.66]That's making me laugh every time.
[12:15.14]I don't know why.
[12:18.73]It's a bad joke.
[12:20.51]Somebody in chat said it, but it's funny.
[12:22.03]Alright, yeah, that's my inventory.
[12:36.39]Where's my health?
[12:37.11]Is there no HUD until I need it?
[12:42.08]This game feels amazing to play, by the way.
[12:43.48]If you haven't got it, I would suggest you do.
[12:46.84]Wait until you decide if it's worth it or not.
[12:48.72]That's what we do here on Friday Gaming Vibes.
[12:53.22]We check it out.
[12:54.29]We see if it's worth your dollar.
[12:57.19]Is Call to the Lamb worth you opening up your wallet?
[13:00.41]Stay tuned and find out on Friday Gaming Vibes.
[13:18.11]Money, money, money, one coin.
[13:21.83]It is yet.
[13:22.61]It is and I haven't bought it yet.
[13:25.91]I'm really excited.
[13:26.75]I'm a huge Finding of Isaac fan.
[13:28.47]You guys all know that.
[13:30.25]So, and there's been a lot of those kind of Isaac likes, I would call them.
[13:35.10]There's been quite a few.
[13:39.54]I never really got into any of the other ones besides Isaac.
[13:44.91]We've nearly reached safety, but look ahead, another poor soul about to be sacrificed.
[13:48.98]Rescue them and they would have no choice but to join your new cult.
[13:51.86]I remember this.
[13:53.56]Almighty bishops of the old faith, we ask you to accept the sacrifice of this wretched soul.
[13:58.56]Who interrupts our ritual and trespasses on sacred ground?
[14:02.39]Is there a charge?
[14:13.23]Can I hold down?
[14:13.81]Probably not.
[14:18.29]Nice.
[14:19.50]This is a Morty like.
[14:26.58]Hey, you know that, that I think they're coming to multiverses at some point here soon.
[14:32.78]So what if I play as Morty?
[14:34.78]Will you guys all leave?
[14:37.16]What if I play as Rick and Morty in multiverse?
[14:38.83]What if it's like my character?
[14:39.91]Okay, what if it's a character that I just connect with?
[14:42.57]And I'm really good with it.
[14:43.57]It's really my style of play.
[14:45.15]Right?
[14:45.37]Play through style and everything, right?
[14:50.60]You're going to have to suffer.
[14:52.94]Well, you won't.
[14:54.22]You can just leave if you want to.
[14:57.76]We've reached safety.
[14:58.54]You have done well.
[15:00.44]The Red Crown will allow you to use those markings on the ground to transport yourself great distances.
[15:04.08]It will take you to a temple that has fallen to ruin.
[15:07.78]There, you'll be able to begin your new cult.
[15:10.56]I'll meet you there.
[15:13.04]I don't think you guys would leave.
[15:15.06]I think a lot of you guys are full of shit.
[15:16.74]I don't think you'd leave.
[15:18.79]You'd say you were leaving.
[15:20.91]And just so like in case the mods wanted to see, like check, you would leave the chat.
[15:26.05]You'd hit the X window and then open a private browsing tab and come back.
[15:30.54]So you could tell your friends that you weren't there, right?
[15:32.36]Like nah, when he was playing, like his freaking board, he was pissed me off.
[15:35.68]So I left.
[15:36.08]You can check the logs.
[15:36.80]I was in there.
[15:47.99]Alright, cool.
[15:49.65]So now we do the town building section.
[15:51.75]This was in the demo.
[15:57.82]Please select a difficulty.
[15:59.16]Don't worry, you can change.
[16:00.92]Okay.
[16:03.88]So as a seasoned binding of Isaac veteran.
[16:08.32]Is this a medium or a hard game?
[16:10.74]What should I do?
[16:13.96]No one's picking this.
[16:18.01]Medium sounds fine, right?
[16:21.49]It's two buttons, dude.
[16:25.99]But somebody had an actual, like, good take here.
[16:29.51]Reviews say the game is easy, so pick a harder one.
[16:34.05]Is that accurate?
[16:43.31]I don't want to... No, not very hard.
[16:46.35]Extra hard is not that bad.
[16:47.89]I'll start with hard.
[16:49.21]We'll go from there if I want to.
[16:50.31]I can up it at any time.
[16:53.43]Or I can lower it if I need to.
[16:56.30]Alright, let's go.
[17:01.32]Okay.
[17:02.46]This crumbling ruin is said to be the site of your new cult.
[17:07.86]We have much to do.
[17:08.48]We begin by indoctrinating this poor soul into the warm embrace of your cult.
[17:13.39]They get resources for you.
[17:14.85]Order this one to collect wood and stone.
[17:23.75]Come here!
[17:25.89]Convert me to your cult.
[17:26.72]I will follow your teachings faithfully.
[17:28.12]Alright, name.
[17:37.18]No.
[17:38.08]Nope.
[17:38.63]Nope.
[17:38.97]Wait, I can just make it whatever I want, right?
[17:40.05]Alright, how about, um... No.
[17:46.82]Um...
[18:02.56]Do Twitch integration.
[18:03.66]I think... I'm not going to do it initially.
[18:05.42]Because I think they're having problems with it.
[18:08.72]They took it offline for a little bit, right?
[18:10.04]And it's, like, really slow.
[18:12.74]I'm definitely going to play this game more than once.
[18:14.23]I guarantee it.
[18:14.89]So, we'll turn it on another time.
[18:18.59]Uh, how about... Fun.
[18:22.79]Fun.
[18:22.99]Fun Bob.
[18:23.97]Fun Bob.
[18:32.98]I'm not going to name the character Morty.
[18:35.72]Bun Bob.
[18:38.72]Sponge Bob.
[18:40.06]Yeah, Bun Bob.
[18:44.06]Choose form.
[18:46.35]Oh, oh wait, wait, I got these because I got the deluxe edition, right?
[18:55.57]Well, they can't be Bun Bob if they're not a bunny.
[19:07.28]Doesn't make any sense, OK?
[19:26.07]OK, variant.
[19:29.77]Yep.
[19:31.08]traits on recruiting this follower immediately gain 10 faith and generates devotion 15 slower all right this is my first one whatever all right so go collect um get wood
[19:54.93]Okay, your cult will grow powerful, but your followers cannot live on prayer alone.
[19:58.73]They need to eat.
[20:01.11]Gather necessary roots to build a cooking fire.
[20:04.35]Let's do meals.
[20:05.05]Alright, cool.
[20:06.11]So I need to collect... Okay, let's go.
[20:08.16]How do I chop trees down?
[20:09.08]Like this?
[20:15.70]Germa, you're wormy.
[20:19.58]What do you know about me?
[20:21.17]You don't know me.
[20:24.83]You don't know me, so don't say stuff like that.
[20:27.19]I'm sorry.
[20:29.51]I'm sorry.
[20:29.81]Do I know you?
[20:31.07]Do I know you?
[20:31.47]Excuse me.
[20:32.89]It's going to take way too long.
[20:46.98]All right, let's build.
[20:48.80]Look at all this shit to build.
[20:50.20]What?
[20:52.36]There's a lot of stuff here.
[20:53.04]Alright, I don't want to mess this up.
[20:55.69]I don't want to mess this up like I messed up my cookie-run kingdom town, okay?
[21:01.75]I had a terrible, awful, awful layout for that, and I uninstalled it.
[21:08.31]Uh, should I be down here?
[21:12.78]Down here?
[21:17.72]No, that's too far away.
[21:19.12]Um, right here's okay.
[21:20.86]I'll clear this out.
[21:31.73]iPad kid.
[21:32.45]You can move things freely.
[21:34.63]Okay.
[21:34.75]All right.
[21:36.17]So they need to eat.
[21:37.86]Hunger of your cult can be seen at the top left of the screen.
[21:39.70]When this gets too low, followers will begin to starve.
[21:41.48]I don't want that.
[21:43.14]Find more food while crusading.
[21:45.18]Routes that pass through foraging.
[21:46.72]All right.
[21:48.56]Plant farms to grow your own food.
[21:50.14]Seeds can be purchased or found while crusading.
[21:53.08]Okay.
[21:57.42]Cool.
[21:57.58]Collect some berry meat and then cook a meal.
[22:09.88]Did I plant the berry seeds?
[22:14.33]I'm not a fan.
[22:15.53]I'm not a fan of this game.
[22:16.77]I don't think I'm going to move on.
[22:21.77]Like such a small, like low attention span.
[22:24.07]Like you won't even do this little part here.
[22:26.30]Okay, let's go.
[22:37.02]Cool.
[22:41.66]Now we must build a shrine.
[22:43.96]We need more followers and more gold.
[22:45.44]Go crusade.
[22:48.08]Our mutual benefactor, the one who waits, has been trapped by the four bishops of the old faith.
[22:53.40]Each of them guards a chain that binds him to the realm beyond.
[22:57.35]We've conjured openings to their realms.
[22:58.95]It is your task to track them down and slay them so that he may be freed.
[23:04.25]Now go.

[23:48.00]I'm sorry.
[23:49.62]I'm wicked sorry.
[23:50.84]Yeah.
[23:52.02]I forgot.
[23:53.46]Okay, Jerry.
[23:54.84]I'm sorry I said that earlier.
[23:57.22]I know that a lot of people were upset that I spoiled Season 6.
[24:08.25]Alright, Darkwood.
[24:09.11]Cool.
[24:09.57]So there's four places to go.
[24:22.79]What are you doing?
[24:30.41]What was that?
[24:32.28]Okay, let's go.
[24:39.70]Don't make this a Rick and Morty joke stream.
[24:41.42]It deserves better.
[24:42.90]I won't...
[24:45.53]It's not... I'm reacting to chat right now.
[24:47.73]It's nothing to do with me.
[24:48.45]Okay, cool.
[24:50.73]A well-balanced blade dealing moderate damage.
[24:52.36]Let's go.
[24:59.70]I... I didn't.
[25:02.90]Entering the lands of the Bishop Leshy.
[25:05.31]Those who do not follow the ways of the Old Faith will be destroyed.
[25:07.99]Let's go.
[25:11.17]Alright, we need more gold and we need more followers.
[25:17.02]Oh shit, I have health now.
[25:17.84]Alright, don't mess it up.
[25:18.60]Alright, we're good.
[25:30.72]Three coins and some hearts?
[25:34.02]You're more of a family guy, streamer?
[25:37.78]Um... I don't know.
[25:45.72]Am I going to Luigi's Mansion this game?
[25:47.66]Am I going to cut literally everything down and not... I'm going to be the slowest player in this game.
[26:09.97]Meow.
[26:11.17]You will get stuff if you do, but it's not a constant drop.
[26:13.75]Though it's worth doing.
[26:14.87]So I should keep doing it.
[26:16.88]I'll keep doing it.
[26:17.94]If it gets me stuff.
[26:22.92]Somebody said you're something like the Sopranos.
[26:24.56]Alright, is this stream more like the Sopranos?
[26:26.55]Am I the Sopranos of Twitch, or am I the family guy streamer of Twitch? ...
[26:43.40]You're the George Lopez of Twitch?
[26:44.86]What are you talking about?
[26:49.96]I don't know what that means.
[26:51.02]Is that an insult or is that like a good thing?
[26:52.87]George Lopez?
[26:58.55]Do people like George Lopez?
[27:01.07]I thought George Lopez is like a TV show and is a comedian, right?
[27:14.46]Uh, I'm gonna go this way.
[27:17.88]You're the Big Bang Theory of Twitch?
[27:19.48]No, I am not.
[27:21.42]No, I'm not.
[27:21.88]That's absolute horseshit and you know it.
[27:24.14]You just said that to make me mad.
[27:30.57]Well, the card showed me once many lifetimes ago, or has it yet to be?
[27:34.25]I've always drawn your cards, Lamb, and yet this is the first.
[27:40.06]You're the Young Sheldon of Twitch.
[27:52.90]Okay, take these cards.
[27:54.44]And I will grant... I will draw another each time we meet.
[27:57.96]When drawn by me, they will grant you a power.
[28:00.78]A power?
[28:01.22]Well, that's both known and unknown.
[28:02.76]The cards will decide that.
[28:03.97]Okay.
[28:06.33]A heart offered, a vow made, or receive double the health when healing.
[28:09.87]What is this one?
[28:11.47]Is that a spirit heart?
[28:14.71]Why would I be the Big Bang Theory?
[28:18.71]Nothing I say... None of the jokes I make are Big Bang Theory kind of jokes.
[28:25.13]When was the last time you heard me talk about a, like, physicist joke?
[28:29.22]Or, like, a joke about the cosmos or something.
[28:31.44]Or, like, a math joke.
[28:32.66]I don't make those here.
[28:34.98]I don't ever talk about that stuff.
[28:36.94]I hate that stuff.
[28:40.27]All those topics I dislike.
[28:43.39]Uh, is this a spirit heart?
[28:53.94]No.
[28:55.08]Yes, I'll take double the health.
[28:57.40]That sounds better.
[29:01.53]You hate the cosmos.
[29:02.83]No, I'm talking about like math jokes.
[29:07.67]I don't, I don't, I'm not a math person.
[29:10.89]Alright, goodbye.
[29:14.81]I think you're more the Frasier of Twitch.
[29:19.43]No, I don't think so.
[29:21.71]No, no, no, no, that's incorrect.
[29:35.81]What do you mean true?
[29:46.60]Emma, isn't Frasier like super intellectual and... Alright, there we go.
[30:00.03]I need health.
[30:02.42]Okay.
[30:02.66]Are these permanent?
[30:03.28]I don't have a follower, though.
[30:04.38]I have no health.
[30:05.10]Can I eat this?
[30:05.68]I'm going to die here.
[30:33.78]Ooh, um, let's get, uh, more food.
[30:36.94]Is this medium?
[30:40.84]This is, no, it's not hard.
[30:44.98]Oh, okay, there's a lot of vegetables here.
[30:47.40]Oh, this is perfect, okay.
[30:49.50]Oh, this is perfect.
[30:50.49]Oh, let me say this.
[30:51.85]Oh, this is, oh, oh.
[30:54.71]Sentence.
[30:56.55]Oh, sentence.
[31:14.01]You're the Lunchables of Twitch.
[31:17.09]Incredibly convenient.
[31:18.61]Tastes great.
[31:20.85]And can fit anywhere.
[31:21.98]Um, okay.
[31:33.13]That's just, I'm very versatile.
[31:38.91]How did I not find any health?
[31:42.58]No, I'm not saying that's what me directly.
[31:44.60]I'm just saying that in general, Lunchables are very convenient.
[31:48.84]They don't taste bad.
[31:49.90]They're fine.
[31:50.44]And you can take them anywhere.
[31:53.74]And nobody complains.
[31:54.70]Okay, I'm going to tell you right now.
[31:57.50]If I were to be in a room, like a conference room, with like 10 executives...
[32:02.80]It doesn't matter.
[32:03.62]Like 10, like multi-billion dollar executives.
[32:06.90]And they're talking about, oh, this is what we're going to do.
[32:08.75]These are the expensive cigars and cigarettes we're going to smoke later.
[32:11.79]Oh, is that a 10,000-year-old Scotch?
[32:13.73]Oh, yeah.
[32:15.11]Oh, yeah.
[32:15.89]What year is that one, John?
[32:18.87]If I was in that room and I pulled out a Lunchables...
[32:23.10]and I opened it, everyone would hear the tear, and everyone would fucking be obsessed with it.
[32:29.23]Everyone would want a piece.
[32:31.09]They would all go, wow, you got Lunchables!
[32:34.57]Oh, sick!
[32:36.05]Everyone would be so happy.
[32:37.93]It doesn't matter.
[32:41.79]Everybody loves Lunchables.
[32:44.71]And then one of the executives would do, oh shit, dude, what a fucking psycho.
[32:48.20]He would be like, let me see, give me, give me.
[32:50.82]He would take the cracker, ham cheese cracker, ham cheese cracker, ham cheese cracker, and everyone around him, everyone's going to be like, dude, slow down, dude.
[33:00.11]Oh, he's going fucking crazy.
[33:02.15]And he would try to get the whole thing in his mouth and we would all clap and laugh.
[33:14.66]I need health.
[33:19.36]You did that on stream like eight years ago.
[33:22.06]Did I do a lungeable stack?
[33:24.34]No, I didn't.
[33:27.80]Wait, I did?
[33:34.43]I literally did.
[33:39.45]What?
[33:48.04]Hold on.
[33:50.66]Was this Lunchables though?
[33:59.27]Can't go in like that.
[34:00.49]Hold on a second.
[34:07.99]I think you can go inside.
[34:14.33]Man is going to choke on stream.
[34:32.19]Why do I have no emotion doing this?
[34:33.55]What's wrong with me?
[34:34.28]Mm-hmm.
[34:43.18]Here, give that to me.
[34:45.78]He doesn't take it out of my mouth, does he?
[34:49.97]You good?
[34:50.33]Mm-hmm.
[34:58.25]Oh, well, that was that was actually like if you're going to throw up face.
[35:01.43]That was like I'm moving weirdly enough where it's going to come up.
[35:07.29]You can't go in like that.
[35:08.09]I think you can go inside.
[35:08.93]Are there Oreos?
[35:10.41]Why would I do it long ways, by the way?
[35:12.65]What the fuck was I doing?
[35:15.53]That's an amateur move right there.
[35:17.07]That was amateur.
[35:19.55]What an amateur.
[35:20.43]You don't do it long ways.
[35:21.87]You do it.
[35:22.65]You do it vertical.
[35:24.45]What are you doing?
[35:26.55]What an idiot.
[35:41.24]I forgot where I would play.
[35:42.50]Whatever, it's fine.
[35:45.01]I forgot where I was.
[35:46.11]Alright, fear not.
[35:52.77]Hold on a sec.
[35:56.31]Let me move this back where it was.
[35:57.61]Okay.
[36:00.76]I should allow it for I still need you.
[36:02.60]Take what you have gathered, build and strengthen the cult.
[36:04.76]This is how power is gained.
[36:06.40]Continue on, undaunted.
[36:07.78]Each time you are brought down, you rise stronger.
[36:13.33]You included the Oreos.
[36:14.53]I don't... I don't know.
[36:16.11]I don't know why I did that.
[36:20.73]We were drinking?
[36:21.75]We were downing beers that stream.
[36:23.79]Oh.
[36:27.65]Yeah, but still, why would you go, like, horizontal?
[36:30.23]It's vertical.
[36:32.57]Okay, so I have... Can I make some more food?
[36:35.80]I don't have any followers, so... What else can I build?
[36:44.32]Alright, I just gotta get back in there.
[36:48.26]Should I cook more food?
[36:52.36]What do you guys think?
[36:57.29]15% chance of pooping instantly.
[37:06.00]Can I eat these?
[37:08.88]No, I can't.
[37:10.90]He can just eat whenever he wants?
[37:16.38]Food will spoil, by the way.
[37:17.94]Oh, shit.
[37:18.54]Okay.
[37:19.74]Pop left to see how hungry.
[37:21.14]Okay.
[37:21.60]Oh, it's alright.
[37:22.04]Alright, let's go.
[37:25.18]Do I run out of room in my inventory?
[37:31.85]Or is it infinite?
[37:34.41]No.
[37:34.73]Alright.
[37:35.13]Sick.
[37:42.01]That's a new weapon.
[37:45.12]Hostate's Cleaver.
[37:47.97]High damage and a little slower.
[37:52.07]That is slow.
[38:03.75]This is a good weapon.
[38:06.11]This is an ungodly weapon.
[38:30.35]Regular sword is better.
[38:34.10]This thing has huge cleave, though.
[38:36.30]In small rooms, this is great.
[38:52.80]Don't hit me.
[38:57.23]Nice.
[39:01.33]Yeah, there are secret rooms, tinted rocks.
[39:06.62]Tinted rock secret areas, right?
[39:08.60]There probably has to be.
[39:18.80]That cleave is so huge.
[39:19.83]What happened?
[39:23.27]What's going on?
[39:30.32]How can this be?
[39:32.40]You were put to the blade, lamb, as all your kind were.
[39:36.11]And yet here you stand before me, unrepentant.
[39:40.15]Crown his power, could it be?
[39:41.49]But I am stronger still.
[39:44.01]Turn tail and run, little lamb.
[39:49.81]Any boss?
[39:50.31]No.
[39:50.83]I think that's the main boss of the act.
[39:52.43]Alright, what do you got?
[40:00.41]Overall weapon damage increased by 1.2 times.
[40:07.42]Almost as much as the Wii was stronger than the GameCube.
[40:10.48]Remember that?
[40:10.90]You guys remember hearing that?
[40:12.99]And how much that pissed everybody off initially?
[40:14.79]The Wii was 1.2 times faster than the GameCube and people were like, what?
[40:23.18]And then it sold like 100 million units.
[40:26.38]I remember reading that initial report and being like, you gotta be fucking kidding me, Nintendo.
[40:29.68]What are you doing?
[40:30.78]Mistake.
[40:31.44]Flop.
[40:32.16]Thing's gonna be a piece of shit.
[40:34.81]And I think like a third of all households on Earth own a Wii.
[40:39.15]So, I was wrong.
[40:45.85]Yeah, it's definitely worth that.
[40:46.67]More damage?
[40:47.72]Hell yeah.
[40:48.00]Just don't get hit.
[40:56.26]Okay, and... Statue of the Mighty Lamb.
[41:03.22]Ooh, cool.
[41:04.28]Okay.
[41:06.42]I need a temple.
[41:07.10]That's cool.
[41:08.70]Is this just decoration?
[41:20.73]Are you ever right?
[41:23.21]I was right about Bitcoin.
[41:24.37]Mm-hmm.
[41:26.98]I bought Bitcoin when it was a dollar.
[41:30.64]And I sold it when it got to a dollar two.
[41:33.42]All of it.
[41:36.63]So, you know, I was right above that, I guess.
[41:45.39]Thanks for the fucking reminder.
[41:59.24]always bet against germa no why would you excuse me don't ever bet against germa don't ever bet against me because you know what I might surprise you hey I might surprise you today you know what I kind of want a compilation of all the times I've done something and said you know what I think I might surprise some of you guys today and then just show the me walking into grenades and stuff
[42:34.09]That damage is awesome.
[42:47.64]You're predictable.
[42:51.28]I feel like on some things I am, but on a lot of things I'm not.
[42:56.41]Like if I was so predictable, when's the next time I'm going to tweet?
[42:59.56]That's not a I'm live tweet.
[43:00.86]You know what I'm saying?
[43:03.06]Like, when am I going to tweet again for real?
[43:04.62]Go ahead and predict that.
[43:24.41]Thing is doing a lot of damage.
[43:26.17]Whoa.
[43:28.09]Ooh.
[43:30.41]Crusaders Blade 2.
[43:31.15]Let me try it out.
[43:41.78]It's faster, but do I want it?
[43:48.18]I don't think it's worth it.
[43:57.90]Yeah, I'm keeping the axe.
[43:58.80]That guy?
[44:15.33]You've come far enough.
[44:16.61]My followers are willing to do anything for me.
[44:18.19]Can you say the same of yours?
[44:19.39]I give myself to the cause, oh mighty leader.

[48:30.58]I'll be watching your every move.
[48:35.06]Do not disappoint me.
[48:42.83]Your viewer base is 5 to 10 at this point.
[48:44.91]Nobody that's 5 to 10 years old is on Twitch.
[48:49.40]I'm sorry, I don't agree.
[48:58.40]That's, no, that, no, no, no.

[49:13.42]That's not Fortnite.
[49:17.67]Nope.
[49:18.37]You know how I am certain?
[49:19.85]I am one million percent positive that the... Because... So, I have nieces and nephews, and I can tell, like, what that whole age group cares about just based on the things that my siblings tell me and things that I see my nieces and nephews do.
[49:34.38]I know what they're into now.
[49:36.70]And I'll tell you, it's not, um, it's not Twitch.
[49:44.08]Um, but then I'm undone.

[50:51.85]They're not here.
[50:52.35]They're not writing like copy pasta paragraphs here.
[50:57.19]It's not how it works.
[50:57.99]All right, why do I want this person to be named?
[51:13.04]How about green?
[51:23.37]Wart.
[51:24.69]Rash.
[51:29.96]Puke.
[51:30.90]Punk.
[51:34.88]Oil.
[51:48.27]Gremlin.
[51:51.19]Rimmel.
[51:52.97]Rimmel.
[51:54.57]Rimmel.
[51:55.41]Rimmel.
[51:56.23]Rimmel.
[51:59.15]Rimmel.
[51:59.87]Grimace.
[52:08.42]You gonna stay there?
[52:10.26]I like the color spine, but this is bad.
[52:12.14]This person doesn't have any good traits.
[52:28.17]Um, you go get stone, because I already have somebody cutting trees down.
[52:33.03]Followers will either work or worship.
[52:34.51]Worshipping followers generate devotion for you to collect.
[52:37.89]But to collect it, you require a shrine.
[52:42.34]Build it.
[52:48.60]Statue, shrine.
[52:51.62]Okay.
[52:54.16]Um, I can only, I have to put it here.
[53:06.67]Nice work.
[53:09.89]Praise be, your followers can now worship you.
[53:14.22]There's a new follower.
[53:15.22]Assign them to worship at the shrine and collect the devotion your followers generate at the shrine to unlock divine inspiration.
[53:23.81]Oh, new follower.
[53:27.23]Thank you.
[53:39.24]Thority.
[53:43.15]I kind of like Thority.
[53:48.77]Thority the pig.
[54:00.12]With the hair.
[54:02.40]On Recruiting Follower, immediately lose 10 faith.
[54:05.24]Heals 15% faster when sick and in bed rest.
[54:09.97]Okay, go Worship.
[54:20.58]So you collect this.
[54:21.46]The more followers worshipping at your shrine, the faster they will fill up.
[54:25.42]If the shrine is full, they will be stopped until it is emptied.
[54:29.02]Once you've collected divine inspiration, unlock new buildings.
[54:31.58]Ooh, that's how you do that.
[54:32.74]Okay, cool.
[54:35.06]All of you actually go worship.
[54:37.03]I can do this bullshit.
[54:37.91]You know what I mean?
[54:42.65]I can do this.
[54:43.85]You guys do that.
[54:44.57]I can't do that.
[54:45.11]Come here.
[54:52.30]Anybody have food?
[54:54.38]I'll finish this.
[54:55.18]You go do that.
[54:55.72]Alright, I need a temple.
[55:09.57]Who wants coffee?
[55:10.58]Oh, there's still food here.
[55:12.04]That's fine.
[55:12.34]Alright, we're good.
[55:21.91]Oh, it wants me to finish this part.
[55:25.68]OK, take it.
[55:28.82]Divine inspiration unlocked.
[55:33.02]Oh my God, OK.
[55:36.22]Just turn into path of exile.
[55:39.20]So what do I want to go from here?
[55:41.30]Sleeping bags?
[55:45.44]Unlock, oh.
[55:50.71]Establish a temple.
[55:52.39]Alright.
[55:55.47]Farm plot or sleeping?
[55:56.85]Probably farm, yeah.
[55:57.71]Farm plot.
[55:59.98]I need some divine inspiration.
[56:07.16]Temple.
[56:11.53]Uh, this will go down.
[56:14.57]Let's put it away, like down here.
[56:21.07]The music slaps?
[56:22.03]It does, yeah.
[56:22.51]It is pretty good.
[56:33.15]Why are you ignoring chat?
[56:35.16]Who said I've been doing that?
[56:35.88]Like on the right stick?
[56:40.10]Twitch integration?
[56:41.12]No!
[56:44.69]Temple is the center of your cult.
[56:45.67]From there, you will preach sermons to grow stronger and perform rituals to mold the fragile minds of your followers.
[56:51.65]You need to maintain the faith of your cult.
[56:55.81]If it falls too low, your followers will dissent against you and eventually leave.
[56:59.80]Get ready to hear your word.
[57:01.80]Show them that you are their great leader.
[57:03.44]Preach a sermon.
[57:07.54]Oh, okay.
[57:08.12]All right.
[57:08.96]Everyone, come on here.
[57:13.05]I'm going to give you a classic from Bart Simpson.
[57:19.01]Rub it up, Deb.
[57:19.75]Thanks for the grub.
[57:21.49]Bart!
[57:22.71]Oh, Homer, it's okay.
[57:24.03]Okay, perform a sermon.
[57:30.31]Drawing energy from your followers to bolster the power of the Red Crown.
[57:40.17]Oh, stop.
[57:42.25]Give me a break.
[57:45.06]It wasn't the impression I was trying to do.
[57:46.58]It was the cadence I was doing and the nostalgia of you remembering the episode.
[57:51.40]That's it.
[57:51.82]I wasn't being like, okay, here comes my good impression of Homer and Bart and Marge.
[57:55.69]No, that was a cadence for you to remember the nostalgic properties of the episode.
[57:59.99]Now, you're going to get timed out if you keep this up.
[58:12.18]It liked it.
[58:16.63]Performing sermons will draw power from them and allow you to unlock new abilities, weapons, and curses.
[58:22.33]Followers with a higher loyalty level will generate more devotion.
[58:27.28]Alright, so we have to do this a lot.
[58:29.16]Oh my god, there's more.
[58:32.10]Oh shit, nice.
[58:41.75]What's your favorite Ten Commandment?
[58:43.93]Thou shalt not steal.
[58:44.95]Leave my shit alone.
[58:48.67]Do it again.
[58:56.68]Okay.
[58:57.70]God, your cult, you need to declare doctrines so that they might obey you.
[59:02.29]Turn to the lands of the old faith and seek out commandment stone fragments.
[59:05.85]With these, you'll be able to declare new doctrines.
[59:08.43]Okay.
[59:21.30]What about thou shalt not kill?
[59:27.13]Thou shalt not steal is like the first one I thought of.
[59:33.69]What are the Ten Commandments off the top of my head?
[59:37.49]Let me see if I can get this.
[59:39.03]Thou shalt not kill.
[59:40.67]Thou shalt not steal.
[59:43.34]Thou...
[59:47.35]Don't help me.
[59:48.25]Thou shalt not kill.
[59:49.45]Thou shalt not steal.
[59:51.34]Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[59:54.38]Right?
[59:57.62]Thou shalt not... What are the other ones?
[60:10.71]Three commandments.
[60:12.60]No, no, no.
[60:13.18]I got to clap.
[60:13.78]Okay.
[60:15.48]Mel Brooks had this joke, and it was an unbelievable joke.
[60:19.14]He's playing as Moses, right?
[60:21.96]With the commandments.
[60:23.36]And he goes up to all the followers that are out there waiting to hear him.
[60:26.13]He comes back with the boy.
[60:27.17]He has the commandments in his hands.
[60:28.87]And he comes over with these three big slabs.
[60:30.91]And they're all waiting for him to talk.
[60:32.23]And they're just like, oh, there he is, Moses.
[60:34.03]And he walks over with these three halves.
[60:35.17]And he's like...
[60:36.28]Yes, I have seen God and we have spoken.
[60:39.10]And what I have for you here, the most important, I have.
[60:43.92]And he drops one of the slabs and it fucking shatters on the ground.
[60:46.92]He says, I have 15.
[60:48.84]The thing falls, it shatters on the ground.
[60:50.70]Then he goes, Ten Commandments.
[60:55.04]Can we watch it?
[60:56.16]Let's watch it right now.
[60:57.66]It's a classic fucking piece of comedy.
[60:59.14]It really is.
[60:59.52]Let's just watch it.
[61:03.97]How long is it?
[61:08.24]It's like 15 seconds long.
[61:12.32]It's so good.
[61:13.32]It's truly like a genius bit.
[61:16.32]You can't go in like that.
[61:17.02]I think you can go inside.
[61:24.47]Okay, here we go.
[61:27.29]It's so funny.
[61:30.11]Lord, I shall give these laws unto thy people.
[61:35.29]Hear me.
[61:36.81]Oh, hear me.
[61:38.87]Oh, it's so good.
[61:41.73]Like what were the other five?
[61:44.85]What were the other five?
[61:50.78]Oh, it's, it's classic.
[62:09.30]Like, wow, those must have been important, right?
[62:11.24]All right, so now we, do I plant?
[62:21.36]It was, the volume was too low.
[62:22.90]Oh, it's all right.
[62:25.58]Those are DLC.
[62:29.80]Yo, dude, when are we going to get a baby food stream?
[62:34.25]Oh.
[62:37.89]yo you're weird that's a weird thing to ask okay I can plant um I can do actually farming now right okay oh it's a bunch of grass wait all right the farm's gonna be over here on the left
[63:10.91]Put it in a diamond shape.
[63:14.34]Oh, come on.
[63:14.84]I ruined it.
[63:16.94]Did I do too many?
[63:36.85]Do a baby food tier list.
[63:43.25]I don't know, man.
[63:44.02]That's one of those ideas that starts out funny, and then in practice is like, I'm not comfortable right now.
[63:50.72]Like the baby sensory stream.
[63:58.25]That's a funny thing to think of and go, wow, that's funny to think about, but doing it in practice is like, this is making me uncomfortable.
[64:15.59]Okay, so water.
[64:19.69]This is sick.
[64:20.83]You actually have like a whole thing like this?
[64:32.90]Alright, so then add fertilizer.
[64:34.46]Oh, I need shit.
[64:36.76]Do they shit?
[64:42.64]Are they shitting?
[64:53.45]Unsanitary conditions at your cult will cause your followers to get sick.
[64:57.28]If a follower becomes sick, assign them to bed rest or they could die.
[65:00.52]Okay.
[65:03.20]Poop, vomit, and dead bodies cause illness to spread quickly throughout your cult.
[65:07.64]Cleaning messes and burying bodies will prevent the spread of illness.
[65:10.10]Oh my god, what?
[65:21.58]That was weird.
[65:22.20]Like, immediate.
[65:26.06]That was disgusting.
[65:31.00]Okay, so I need more.
[65:31.82]Alright, this is fun, but let's keep going.
[65:42.49]Everyone can... Everyone's good, right?
[65:49.26]I need a deadly sins tier list.
[65:52.13]You mean like in order of which one I think is the worst or the, what do you mean?
[65:56.47]Ooh.
[66:19.00]No, it needs to be by Fullmetal Alchemist characters.
[66:21.32]Oh, come on.
[66:26.44]By FMA characters.
[66:35.31]Okay, the one who waits is pleased with your progress and wishes to grant you a crown ability.
[66:38.43]Thanks.
[66:52.24]Ooh.
[66:57.81]So there's a... Oh, it's perfect, right?
[67:00.91]Hit it right in the middle.
[67:02.67]That's fun.
[67:06.65]Enemies you slay will now drop fervor.
[67:08.45]Collect this to replenish your curses.
[67:11.27]Alright.
[67:12.73]The righteous anger earned by striking down non-believers in works like ammunition for your curses.
[67:19.96]Fervor will drop when you slay an enemy.
[67:21.87]Collecting it refuels your curses.
[67:29.73]You ever heard about the Bible story where the kids bully a bald guy and they get mauled by a bear?
[67:35.32]I can't say I've caught up with my Bible history or Bible verses in a long time, man.
[67:41.80]Okay.
[67:43.64]Okay.
[67:56.38]Old nuggets.
[68:06.02]What's this?
[68:09.99]Does time of day matter?
[68:19.31]I probably shouldn't be using that on these guys, right?
[68:32.79]Do you drink shower water?
[68:34.09]Nope.
[68:34.99]I open my mouth, let the shower water go in, fill my mouth enough where it overflows from inside.
[68:40.50]I just hold my mouth open and it goes, fill, fill, fill, fill, fill, and then goes over the sides.
[68:45.54]And then I spit it all out.
[69:00.64]Ow.
[69:04.27]Oh shit.
[69:05.09]Okay, these guys are weird.
[69:08.65]Oh my god, I'm getting destroyed in this one.
[69:10.43]I have to pay more attention.
[69:13.03]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[69:18.31]Pay more attention, please.
[69:26.26]Do you have good tap water?
[69:27.90]Nah, I don't know if I would drink the Vegas tap water.
[69:33.03]No, I don't, I'm not, I'm not into that.
[69:36.83]Go down?
[69:45.37]Uh, what's up here?
[69:48.52]Oh shit, wait, go back, back, back.
[69:49.76]No, I don't wanna go there yet.
[69:52.34]How do I get over there?
[70:07.03]use the map.
[70:09.05]Oh, it's not connected.
[70:11.65]Okay.
[70:11.95]It's not connected.
[70:12.53]That's why.
[70:15.57]See how the little thing, the little tag on the bottom is not connected.
[70:18.87]I thought for some reason I couldn't get that way.
[70:25.45]Don't you have a filter?
[70:26.71]Yeah.
[70:28.07]Still, I wouldn't, I wouldn't just drink just regular tap water.
[70:32.92]It freaks me out.
[70:33.74]It just does.
[70:34.22]I'm sorry.
[70:47.11]I don't know.
[70:47.83]I don't like the way tap water smells.
[71:01.20]You know when you put tap water up to your mouth and you can smell that chlorine-y kind of smell?
[71:08.07]No.
[71:08.65]It's got a very specific smell to it.
[71:13.91]What is this?
[71:30.34]Go find out, OK?
[71:33.82]Ooh.
[71:40.06]OK, I only hit one of them.
[71:42.35]Enjoy the rest of your dinner.
[71:43.41]Uh oh, I think I really hurt that guy.
[71:47.75]OK, salmon, berry seed.
[71:50.61]Let's do salmon.
[71:51.43]How much is this, free?
[71:54.28]Is it free?
[71:59.76]Stop!
[72:00.66]How do I get him to stop doing that?
[72:05.57]This is free!
[72:06.21]All this is free if I go in here and do this.
[72:08.69]Oops.
[72:12.35]I honestly did not think that was anything alive.
[72:14.31]I thought that was just like a house.
[72:24.24]Okay, cool.
[72:27.54]What's over here?
[72:30.08]Whoa.
[72:33.49]Um.
[72:36.29]Cool.
[72:36.85]This way.
[72:41.71]New follower.
[72:44.77]The warm it is hungry, it feeds.
[72:45.89]It partakes of our flesh, but that is the price for safety.
[72:48.19]For that, we gladly give it all we have.
[72:57.99]That's why these guys were freaking me out, because they do the fin from multiverses.
[73:05.41]Swing already!
[73:06.03]Do it!
[73:15.84]Are there iframes?
[73:16.42]Can I dodge through people?
[73:34.89]Good.
[73:35.75]All right, what do you have for magical powers?
[73:49.49]Cool.
[73:50.89]Find commandment stone fragments, which are there on the map somewhere?
[73:53.99]Oh, there's meat.
[74:16.39]What are your current thoughts on multiverses?
[74:18.16]Give me that mic.
[74:18.66]Here's what I think about multiverses.
[74:22.64]You already know what I think about multiverses.
[74:23.98]Don't ask.
[74:38.56]Steal devotion.
[74:40.82]Sure.
[74:43.10]Okay.
[74:43.78]Break this.
[74:51.21]Is it bad?
[74:52.57]Oh.
[75:01.33]Oh, champion.
[75:02.84]Champion.
[75:07.50]You foolishly persist, little lamb.
[75:10.00]I hear your lies and I smell your fear.
[75:11.90]The red crown rises again.
[75:13.60]But what an unworthy bearer it has.
[75:15.43]Crack the quest.
[75:19.45]Oh, no.
[75:19.79]I don't want to do that right now.
[75:32.55]And it stuns too.
[75:33.97]That's pretty cool.
[75:48.80]Oh, I thought I had power.
[75:50.44]Didn't.
[75:57.40]Cool.
[76:09.25]Alright, that was funny.
[76:11.83]When attacked, 10% chance of negating damage or deals poison damage.
[76:15.86]Yeah, this one.
[76:17.38]That's for the fast swing.
[76:18.42]Should be cool, right?
[76:31.47]That power can probably change, I'm assuming, right?
[76:41.73]This is a tablet fragment.
[76:44.13]We've been good.
[76:44.63]Give us face cam.
[76:45.39]Alright.
[76:47.87]Wow, I got more lighting in here and I look at how greasy and gross I look.
[77:05.02]My hair looks like.
[77:08.16]It came out of the oven and it's done.
[77:12.49]This looks like cooked hair.
[77:17.11]My hair looked different.
[77:18.33]It's done now.
[77:19.09]It's ready.
[77:21.49]Okay.
[77:23.39]What befell this pantheon?
[77:25.16]Alas, it is the nature of beasts to forget and of gods to be forgotten.
[77:29.38]Look, it's shiny.
[77:29.94]I should probably wash my face.
[77:33.56]Yeah, I'm going to wash my face after this.
[77:36.58]Alright, mayhap they left, mayhap they slept, mayhap they devoured, and were devoured in turn.
[77:40.29]Those few who remained spread roots, spun webs, molded this world to meet their men and theirs.
[77:44.98]There were many gods, hundreds.
[78:06.65]You found enough Bragmas to form a commandment stone.
[78:10.09]These are used to declare new doctrines for your cult to follow.
[78:13.85]Use the altar in your temple to declare a new doctrine.
[78:15.67]Wait, I can change the sermons?
[78:20.17]That's kind of cool.
[78:22.33]Cooked turkey hair.
[78:25.11]Don't you feel like if you just took a piece of this off, it would be delicious?
[78:27.48]Alright.
[78:30.30]Whoa.
[78:32.80]One, two, and then he goes... Whack.
[78:43.49]One, two, and then he goes.
[78:46.97]Oh, you idiot.
[79:05.87]Oi!
[79:12.96]I'll get greedy.
[79:13.49]It's four.
[79:18.45]You can get four in, that's it.
[79:24.40]Oh, whoa!
[79:25.31]Four times?
[79:25.73]All right.
[80:04.65]use the curse shot?
[80:05.53]Not enough time, man.
[80:10.77]German, name one more commandment or I'm going to stop watching.
[80:20.31]I'm actually going to try.
[80:21.93]Thou shalt not steal.
[80:22.89]Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[80:24.39]Thou shalt not kill.
[80:25.91]Thou shalt
[80:28.14]not commit trespasses.
[80:30.94]Thou shalt forgive trespasses against us.
[80:34.30]Thou shalt... I actually really don't know.
[80:47.53]There's ten of these.
[80:48.67]Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[80:54.58]Thou shalt not
[81:01.86]Oh, it's not a bunch of nots.
[81:04.46]Thou shalt not steal.
[81:05.86]Thou shalt not kill.
[81:07.16]Thou shalt not commit adultery, right?
[81:09.87]There's other things you should do, right?
[81:11.99]Thou shall... Thou shall... Eat a balanced breakfast.
[81:25.16]With at least one or two grams of whole grains.
[81:28.30]Thou shall...
[81:31.75]always thou shall love thy neighbor thou shall drink water drink eight ounces of water every two hours or something thou shall always bathe and never be on stream with uh cooked turkey hair did I get one
[81:56.84]That's too much water?
[81:58.30]Eight ounces of water every... You're supposed to eat eight glasses of water a day, right?
[82:10.72]Thou shalt... Thou shalt not too much.
[82:16.70]I don't know.
[82:17.70]Did I actually get one?
[82:20.41]Thou shalt...
[82:23.50]Treat each other with respect, or something along those lines.
[82:26.76]I'm just gonna look them up.
[82:29.24]Okay.
[82:30.56]The Ten Commandments.
[82:34.98]How do I not know these?
[82:43.29]Ten Commandments.
[82:49.63]Okay.
[82:49.85]Okay.
[82:53.15]Thou shalt not worship false gods.
[82:56.17]I am the Lord your God.
[82:57.23]You shall have no other gods.
[83:01.41]Never take my name in vain.
[83:03.41]You shall keep the Sabbath day holy.
[83:05.21]Honor your mother and father.
[83:07.45]You shalt not kill.
[83:09.32]You shalt not commit adultery.
[83:10.62]You shall not steal.
[83:11.66]Okay, so the other ones were... I just... I was thinking of...
[83:26.35]So honor your father and mother.
[83:27.71]Hey, I always do.
[83:29.13]I say call your mother every day.
[83:30.30]So I knew one.
[83:30.80]I knew it.
[83:37.81]That counts.
[83:45.60]OK, so it's like don't have no false gods.
[83:49.12]No other.
[83:50.28]Yeah, I just I don't know why I was thinking that they would like in stable direct like you do not do this.
[83:56.59]Do this.
[83:57.17]Uh, follower form.
[84:02.25]Yeah, I don't need berries.
[84:03.05]Let's get a follow.
[84:06.51]Oh cool.
[84:11.03]Losing viewers.
[84:11.81]I'm not... No, I'm not.
[84:14.71]It doesn't even update that fast.
[84:18.75]Every time somebody says, oh, dude, you've bled like a thousand viewers.
[84:22.64]Dude, it updates like every two to three minutes.
[84:26.46]You don't know that.
[84:38.54]Hey, guys, let's leave.
[84:39.62]Let's all leave.
[84:44.09]Do you have a skincare routine?
[84:45.25]I don't.
[84:46.15]Trust me, you don't want to know it today.
[84:48.11]I didn't do anything.
[84:48.85]I didn't even take a shower.
[84:51.25]I probably should take a quick shower.
[84:53.49]Should I?
[84:53.75]Their faith is a resource.
[84:59.34]Spend it as you would gold, for you can always regain their trust with a well-placed gesture of kindness.
[85:07.58]I give you power to read their minds.
[85:09.30]Okay.
[85:16.06]So I can see what they want?
[85:21.04]You've declared a doctrine which has granted you a new follower action.
[85:23.66]Okay.
[85:33.41]Take a quick shower, but leave the stream on?
[85:35.69]I might actually do that.
[85:37.29]Not right now, but in a little bit before we do two-point canvas.
[85:39.47]All right.
[85:42.23]Cool.
[85:43.33]How's everybody doing?
[85:44.32]It's kind of getting overgrown here, isn't it?
[85:45.98]You got a problem?
[85:49.82]Great leader, the cult is growing by the day.
[85:51.50]It is time you gave it a name.
[86:03.65]Jeremiah?
[86:13.32]Looks good to me.
[86:17.68]Looks good to me.
[86:27.31]Oh, water.
[86:38.93]Yeah, I'm going to take a shower in between changing game.
[86:44.72]Is that weird?
[86:47.93]And on the BRB screen, I'm just going to put, well, I won't spoil.
[86:53.59]Is that TOS?
[86:54.33]Can I do that?
[86:54.75]All right.
[86:57.49]If I put just on the BRB screen, just a running water shower, the kind of just like, oh, shower sound like and have just like stock audio of a guy going like, can I do that?
[87:23.69]Uh, definitely place to sleep.
[87:33.13]So I can make beds now.
[87:42.04]How much does this cost?
[87:43.82]These are expensive.
[87:44.54]I'll do three.
[87:50.94]Three is fine.
[87:57.98]What happened to your BRB art screen?
[88:05.86]There were thousands of images.
[88:08.46]And more and more kept pouring in every week.
[88:10.80]And we were never going to be able to show them.
[88:13.58]And I only stream like two or three times a week.
[88:16.84]Not possible.
[88:19.68]It just was impossible.
[88:21.38]It was physically not possible.
[88:34.92]BunBob lives here.
[88:35.80]Rembo lives here.
[88:41.70]For those that don't know, I used to have a BRB art screen that would show like 10 to 20 pieces of art.
[88:48.41]And we ran into the problem where
[88:51.62]It was just, we were months and months behind.
[88:55.83]So you would see images on that screen from like a reference from like six months ago.
[89:00.95]And it got to the point where we had too many where it was just never, ever going to be physically ever possible.
[89:06.94]And I could have like, the only way I could have really caught up was if for like two or three straight days for like six to 10 hours for three, four days, just show a drawing on screen for five seconds.
[89:19.91]Why would I do that?
[89:21.37]At that point, that's just showing it just to get it over with.
[89:26.81]I don't want to do that.
[89:30.31]That just feels like I don't want to do that.
[89:36.81]There's a fan art channel in the Discord that tons of people use it.
[89:42.36]There's a creative channel in the Discord.
[89:43.76]Tons of people use it.
[89:45.08]That's where it is.
[89:49.45]What do you want?
[89:53.29]I'm famished.
[89:54.49]What do you mean you don't have food?
[90:01.56]What do you mean?
[90:02.04]How do you not have food?
[90:05.66]Ooh, let's make some fish.
[90:09.91]How much is this making?
[90:10.95]Yeah.
[90:11.37]Hey, come get the fish and come get some cool ingredients.
[90:15.11]Eat up.
[90:18.86]Oh, it's in front of you.
[90:25.31]The base is an eyesore.
[90:26.95]We need beauty to celebrate your glory.
[90:28.71]Let us build decorations.
[90:32.03]Um, okay, fine.
[90:35.35]What do you got?
[90:38.97]Wow, you did it.
[90:39.49]Truly, you are without flaw.
[90:40.55]I'm grateful.
[90:42.81]Okay.
[90:44.59]Oh, wait.
[90:56.14]Should I do it again?
[90:58.18]I don't think I want to do body pit yet.
[90:59.38]Farming bundle?
[91:04.20]Oh yeah, hell yeah.
[91:07.30]I need another sleeping bag.
[91:08.65]Yeah, that's true.
[91:12.05]I have to recruit the new guy.
[91:16.09]Well, hold on.
[91:16.97]I need to make sure he has a place to sleep.
[91:35.63]Okay, so you come on in.
[91:38.81]Convert me.
[91:52.87]Dimple.
[91:56.11]You can keep this for him.
[92:11.55]Okay, so I want you to, um... Chop freeze.
[92:18.28]But go to bed, because... Who the fuck are you?
[92:21.00]I need another bed.
[92:24.16]Hold on.
[92:26.74]Where did this person come from?
[92:34.60]Shalumba.
[92:35.60]Bye.
[92:41.04]Um.
[92:44.72]Has sticks coming out of your head?
[92:47.13]Those sticks or those antlers?
[93:02.47]Cool.
[93:03.75]Easy to level up, but general OK, so we don't want this person ever doing a faith or devotion stuff.
[93:13.46]These names are lazy.
[93:17.65]Guys, you want me to give the cool names to the people that are going to die in like 40 minutes?
[93:25.53]Why would I do that?
[93:30.12]Wait, wait, wait.
[93:30.48]You have a bed over here.
[93:31.02]No, no, no.
[93:31.80]I got it.
[93:32.06]I got it.
[93:36.24]Over here.
[93:41.34]This is yours.
[93:43.96]Alright, so do I have to sleep too?
[93:45.52]Or do I not sleep?
[93:55.87]OK.
[93:55.97]Decorations.
[93:58.70]They wanted some decorations.
[93:59.60]I put this one here.
[94:00.36]We'll do two, right?
[94:05.02]There you go.
[94:05.52]There's your decoration.
[94:20.49]They want three?
[94:22.73]Uh, is it three?
[94:25.69]Alright, let's get rid of this big rock.
[94:27.05]It's kind of in the way.
[94:37.63]Why is he so greasy?
[94:39.01]Alright, everybody.
[94:42.26]I want everybody to mine.
[94:44.38]Everybody.
[94:45.92]Over here.
[94:48.78]Get rid of this.
[94:55.95]Why does he look so greasy?
[95:01.73]What's your problem?
[95:04.70]Okay, read mind.
[95:07.60]Okay.
[95:11.76]Bad chat.
[95:12.52]Boring.
[95:12.88]Must avoid them in the future.
[95:13.98]I agree.
[95:16.10]Good chat.
[95:16.60]I had a great conversation with a fellow cult member.
[95:21.35]Okay.
[95:27.40]Rude.
[95:30.72]Somebody was rude to them in chat.
[95:33.58]Alright, I need one more decoration.
[95:42.21]Is Twitch integration?
[95:43.07]Yeah, I know.
[95:43.85]I don't have it on.
[95:46.05]Last time somebody was talking about it, they said it's really slow and kind of bugged out.
[95:49.71]It's not in a good spot right now.
[95:53.34]Apparently.
[95:54.50]We'll do it later.
[95:58.13]Alright, where's the gremlin?
[96:01.25]Okay, cool.
[96:06.89]Dude, I'm loving the Friday game vibes.
[96:09.01]Nice.
[96:09.89]Hey, welcome to the stream.
[96:13.29]Alright, it's time.
[96:16.38]Everyone get in here.
[96:17.02]Uh, we're gonna do crowd.
[96:26.58]Okay, I'm declaring... I declare... That... Um... Dance around the flame to increase the cult's faith.
[96:48.04]Ooh, yeah, let's do it.
[96:56.04]Turn off... Dude, what the fuck, dude.
[96:57.70]Turn off the gigachat filter.
[97:01.80]Fine.
[97:04.09]God damn it.
[97:09.53]So, fuck.
[97:09.97]I didn't think people were going to call me out on this.
[97:13.46]But, whatever.
[97:26.77]I'll turn it off.
[97:45.75]No, I'm going to keep it on.
[97:51.47]I think I look better with this on, don't you think?
[97:58.00]Why would I turn the filter off?
[98:15.67]Nah, keep it on.
[98:20.30]Even if you know, I don't really care.
[98:21.32]I don't give a shit.
[98:25.30]Alright, what are we doing?
[98:28.12]I need more... What?
[98:33.70]Were they not happy about something?
[98:34.66]25?
[98:35.81]What is that?
[98:36.67]25 what?
[98:39.89]Bones?
[98:40.07]Whatever.
[98:54.84]Do a sermon.
[98:55.46]Oh, I thought I thought there was a sermon.
[98:57.25]Oops, OK.
[99:03.37]Destroy their skeletons.
[99:06.33]Alright.
[99:10.01]Perform rituals in the temple.
[99:11.09]These usually raise faith or help you solve problems.
[99:14.70]Rituals are performed using the bones of your fallen enemies, spiders.
[99:21.57]After slaying a non-believer, create their bodies to gather their bones.
[99:26.19]Alright.
[99:26.39]Let's do a sermon, though.
[99:43.82]Bane weapons?
[99:49.68]Curse of three new curses will appear on you.
[99:51.49]Yeah, I see this.
[99:59.65]Cool.
[100:11.24]Please put in a different Lego headpiece.
[100:13.04]I don't like this one.
[100:16.30]Well, now you don't get it at all.
[100:24.63]Okay.
[100:26.33]Looking good.
[100:27.51]Looking good.
[100:28.31]Uh, cooking fire.
[100:36.43]I need more.
[100:36.83]Alright, I gotta go and adventure.
[100:37.79]Are these ready?
[100:40.71]Oh shit, they are ready.
[100:45.59]It destroys the crop?
[100:59.31]Please, we need Cam.
[101:00.57]I'll put Cam back on when I get back from the shower.
[101:02.34]How's that sound?
[101:07.04]Please, come back.
[101:07.78]No, I'm not gone.
[101:23.59]Please do Mr. Satan voice.
[101:26.34]That person just followed.
[101:27.84]Every new follower, I do that.
[101:28.99]Alright, I'm gonna go adventure.
[101:32.67]Everybody happy?
[101:33.25]I'm gonna make some food.
[102:03.53]Here, if you're hungry, go ahead and eat it.
[102:15.92]Food's up.
[102:16.22]I'm gonna take a shower.
[102:17.38]Relax.
[102:20.62]Who's this?
[102:24.91]You have so many mouths to feed, you must need some seeds.
[102:27.25]Okay.
[102:27.97]Okay.
[102:33.97]I don't think I need it right now.
[102:35.75]This game is awesome.
[102:39.09]This game is genuinely really fun.
[102:43.03]Whoa.
[102:45.10]Trader's razor or hounds of fate.
[102:50.46]Yeah.
[102:54.62]Oh, I can take both.
[102:57.62]Wait.
[103:00.95]Oh, I see.
[103:15.71]Camellia?
[103:16.33]Uh-oh.
[103:21.34]So it is true.
[103:23.38]The red crown sits upon the brow of another.
[103:25.78]Ha, we did everything we could to... It matters not.
[103:29.76]We need not bother Shamura with this.
[103:32.70]Deal with it, brother.
[103:34.81]It's your command.
[103:39.95]Whoa!
[103:40.65]Alright, stop being an idiot.
[104:07.15]Alright, how do I do the bowing thing?
[104:17.11]You know what I noticed about the game?
[104:18.73]You can't mash.
[104:22.00]I guess maybe you can.
[104:22.84]You have to get the timing right to swing.
[104:25.74]Because if I go like... I guess it is that way.
[104:32.55]OK, I think you have to just like mash to keep it in succession, because if I don't mash it, the combo gets caught.
[104:42.09]What about the bones?
[104:44.73]How do I do?
[104:45.15]Oh, you just break it, OK.
[104:46.43]I didn't know it was special.
[104:53.04]The game slows down when you connect a hit.
[105:05.14]Smash some shampoo into your hair.
[105:11.50]Okay.
[105:20.23]Ooh, nice.
[105:40.68]Hey, I thought that was a follower.
[105:42.42]I didn't think that was an enemy.
[105:56.78]You look like a retired porn star.
[106:02.10]Whatever you say.
[106:15.62]I missed a raid.
[106:16.38]Automated.
[106:16.82]Thank you, Automated, for the raid.
[106:19.96]Appreciate it.
[106:20.42]I don't know when that was.
[106:21.16]I think it was a while ago.
[106:22.46]Welcome.
[106:24.00]Thank you, Auto.
[106:28.48]Poison damage.
[106:29.02]Nice.
[106:32.96]You left a heart?
[106:33.70]I was looking to chat.
[106:43.60]I want to look at more stuff over here.
[106:52.47]I'll come back once I'm done from the shower.
[106:59.12]10% crit, yeah.
[107:01.18]Although that's really good too.
[107:02.64]Now I want the crit for sure.
[107:05.00]More damage.
[107:20.21]Bones.
[107:30.67]I know, I'm breaking everything.
[107:32.55]I'm taking so much longer.
[107:34.12]I heard you shower every five years.
[107:39.30]Honestly, I know people say like, oh, I don't, you know, I don't like wash my hair like all the time or once a week.
[107:47.29]If I do not take a shower every day, I am disgusting.
[107:53.29]Disgusting.
[107:55.81]I don't know.
[107:56.91]I must just be a gross person.
[108:02.07]I'm so sweaty and greasy every day.
[108:05.65]If I do not take a shower every day, I am absolutely revolting to be around.
[108:14.86]I don't know, maybe some people don't generate as much filth as I do or something.
[108:40.61]Poison's great.
[108:49.55]Maybe it's your mayo and peanut butter diet.
[109:01.10]Peanut butter is... Alright, I'm not going to listen to this slander.
[109:05.86]Peanut butter is really good for you.
[109:09.26]It's so good for you.
[109:11.32]There's so many health benefits of just really good, real peanut butter.
[109:15.34]Get that, get that slander out of this chat.
[109:24.88]Not if that's the only thing you eat.
[109:29.15]I don't turn the stream off and go get a spoon and sit there and eat crunchy peanut butter out of a jar and go, that's it.
[109:35.37]Oh, all of my nutrients.
[109:38.34]I'm not like Super Mario.
[109:39.60]I don't just eat big mushrooms and then go to... That's not how it works.
[109:47.13]I don't have the Super Mario diet, guys.
[109:48.85]It's not mushrooms and cake.
[109:55.25]The only thing Mario eats in the entire series of Mario Bros.
[109:58.92]is the cake at the end and a bunch of mushrooms.
[110:03.26]And spaghetti.
[110:04.50]Yeah, but is that canon, though?
[110:07.34]I don't know if that's canon.
[110:15.33]Is it cannon?
[110:24.41]And he eats flowers too.
[110:35.72]You got some spaghetti on your overalls.
[110:38.96]Oh, fuck you, Luigi.
[110:40.16]Yeah, I've seen it.
[110:51.99]that video be honest are you actually Mario um no no I don't have full health you like partially hydrogenated or natural peanut butter there I mean they they're natural good peanut butter where when you look at it it's like watery on top
[111:23.02]That's the good stuff.
[111:25.06]Now, just a regular Skippy peanut butter is so good if you want.
[111:29.32]It's almost like a dessert peanut butter.
[111:32.93]But the one with like the peanut oil on the top, it's, oh man, it is gold.
[111:40.11]That's gross.
[111:41.25]Yeah, it's peanut oil.
[111:46.70]Skippy peanut butter is like a dessert peanut butter for me.
[111:54.42]natural peanut butter with the oil that settles and you have to mix it up a little bit or I'm telling you man sometimes I just scoop in there and I get a bunch of the top layer oil and a little bit of the top layer of the peanut butter and I eat it it's delicious oh that's good and why is that gross somehow
[112:20.74]If you have a bag of Doritos on your desk in front of you right now, sitting on your desk, you are not allowed to say, oh, that's gross.
[112:27.85]If you have, if you look down, if you're holding a half empty bag of Doritos in your hand, you do not say, oh, to me eating peanut butter with some peanut oil on it.
[112:36.03]Let's get out of here with that.
[112:39.86]If you look down right now and your hand is covered in fucking hockey dust, I don't want to hear shit about how I like peanut butter.
[113:00.10]It's not the same.
[113:01.20]What are you talking about?
[113:07.43]What about sushi?
[113:11.41]That's good.
[113:15.43]You drinking the oil.
[113:16.57]I'm not... I don't tip it up and like... No, I'm talking... It's like a little test.
[113:24.30]It's a little tasting.
[113:26.20]That's it, man.
[113:27.30]It's not a big deal.
[113:28.28]It's really not.
[113:29.77]And it's way better than the talkie dust that's all over your fingers.
[113:38.44]That one.
[113:49.88]Olive oil or butter?
[113:52.14]They're both good.
[113:52.84]I mean, olive oil is better.
[113:54.50]I think.
[114:00.92]But I don't put butter on that much stuff.
[114:03.70]Olive oil is better.
[114:16.64]Yeah, you all just wait.
[114:17.76]Just wait when the apocalypse comes.
[114:21.72]And I'm the guy that has like 20 vats of peanut butter in his pantry.
[114:28.30]You can live off that shit.
[114:30.02]I'm going to live for a long time.
[114:32.86]I'm going to be sitting there.
[114:33.58]You're going to be trading peanut butter for... It's going to be a commodity.
[114:37.15]Ooh.
[114:42.21]Ooh.
[114:50.91]I don't envy you.
[114:54.05]That's... I don't... I'm kidding.
[114:56.05]That's an old routine.
[115:01.26]Old bit.
[115:02.70]No, it's not.
[115:05.36]Um... I'll take this.
[115:09.46]Alright.
[115:12.22]What is recycle?
[115:14.85]Oh, that's cool.
[115:18.58]already reused two jokes this stream listen guys I've said probably two to three trillion words over the course of more than 10 to 11 plus years on camera okay I have said every single word in the dictionary probably 50 times times 10. I've said two to three trillion words on camera
[115:49.01]People will come in and be like, hey, dude, um, do you know, like, why did you say, like, seven years ago, um, you said this in a video, and I'm just kind of wondering, like, what your stance on that still is.
[115:57.70]She's like, dude, I've said two trillion fucking sentences.
[116:00.64]I don't know.
[116:03.46]You should have asked me seven or eight years ago.
[116:05.13]You should have asked me two months ago.
[116:06.67]You should have asked me five weeks ago.
[116:09.09]I don't know.
[116:23.65]What is this?
[116:27.16]Wait, you're gonna eat this person?
[116:28.98]Do you run on pure instinct?
[116:30.96]No.
[116:48.91]Oh, I can buy?
[116:49.47]I'll take it.
[116:49.91]Oh, it's a follower.
[116:52.55]Cool, yeah.
[116:59.20]Let's break everything in this guy's entire house.
[117:26.33]It actually is worth breaking everything.
[117:30.46]Bye.
[117:32.78]That was dope.
[117:55.46]Wait, what does this do?
[117:56.04]Oh!
[117:57.12]Okay, it's just that one.
[118:01.65]I think I only have a couple of those unlocked.
[118:25.73]Peanut butter is good.
[118:26.23]I don't eat peanut butter every single day.
[118:28.39]I eat it sometimes.
[118:30.03]It's a great snack.
[118:30.71]You put it on toast.
[118:31.51]It's really filling.
[118:35.17]It'll last a long time.
[118:36.45]You can have it a bunch so you don't just run out.
[118:38.35]You don't just run as you don't just run out of peanut butter.
[118:42.85]You don't.
[118:52.17]I mean, the jar will be empty, but it's not something that's like, oh shit, we're out of peanut butter.
[118:57.80]No, it lasts a very, very long time.
[119:07.69]No, it's not like the bullshit, the bullshit ice creams where they make, they have a whole box and there's like two in the box or like four in the whole box.
[119:19.81]That's how you can look in there and be like, somebody ate three of these and I only had one.
[119:25.32]Not the same.
[119:34.74]That one's good.
[119:37.93]By the way, I was that person.
[119:43.84]I told you the story about the... Did I tell you guys about the Twix ice cream bars?
[119:48.32]No, it was Snickers.
[119:49.86]Snickers ice cream bars.
[119:54.66]Have I talked about that?
[119:55.65]How my brother used to get really pissed off at me?
[120:01.39]Not just with Snickers ice cream bars, but with other very, very valuable treats.
[120:10.44]They would only be like four or six in a box or something.
[120:12.85]I think there was like four.
[120:15.67]And hold on.
[120:16.60]Hold that thought.
[120:17.24]This is like a major fight.
[121:37.58]Yeah!
[121:45.04]Okay, so anyways.
[121:47.00]So I used to... I loved ice cream.
[121:49.89]I loved treats.
[121:50.71]Any little snack, I loved it.
[121:53.45]And in the house, there would always just be one box of Twix ice cream bars, or Snickers ice cream bars, or drumsticks, whatever it was.
[122:00.35]And I would always lie to my brother.
[122:03.70]Because I would go down... I could never eat just one of those.
[122:09.03]I always ate two.
[122:10.81]Because it wasn't enough.
[122:13.61]Those Snickers ice cream bars were small.
[122:17.17]So I would just be obsessed with it.
[122:18.41]I would eat the whole thing and it'd be like, I have to have another one.
[122:22.55]So I'd eat two.
[122:24.44]And then like an hour later, I already had heard one.
[122:30.70]And my brother would not have one yet.
[122:32.90]And he would go to the box, there'd be one in the box.
[122:35.60]And he'd be like, what are you doing?
[122:38.19]Jeremy!
[122:39.61]Jeremy, how many did you have?
[122:42.17]I'd be like, well, I had like one.
[122:44.15]He was just lying.
[122:45.49]And then he'd be like, I know.
[122:46.37]And he would go look for wrappers.
[122:48.06]He would go look for wrappers.
[122:49.60]He'd be like, oh, yeah?
[122:50.28]Because I would leave that shit on the desk and stuff or in my room, whatever.
[122:54.14]And he would go be like, oh, yeah, really?
[122:59.58]I was smart enough, though.
[123:00.36]I kept them in my fucking pocket.
[123:01.40]What, do you think I'm dumb?
[123:06.25]But he would always get so pissed.
[123:12.55]Let's get the wood.
[123:18.53]I obviously don't do that anymore since I was like a teenager.
[123:20.96]I was like a young teenager.
[123:28.12]I don't do that anymore.
[123:28.92]Guys, I don't really eat ice cream that much anymore.
[123:34.62]I love ice cream, but I don't really have that often.
[123:45.96]It's so good, though.
[123:50.98]You do that with peanut butter.
[123:51.96]No one is going to be... That's the thing, but that's what I said.
[123:54.39]It's not a... Peanut butter is not a high-value treat.
[123:58.53]Quicks ice cream bars are incredibly high-value.
[124:03.77]My brother would not go into the pantry and be like, Dude!
[124:06.91]The peanut butter's half gone!
[124:08.32]What the heck are you doing, man?
[124:09.62]The peanut butter's gone!
[124:11.14]But no way.
[124:12.20]That's not a high-value treat.
[124:18.53]That would never happen.
[124:19.53]If peanut butter was half gone one day, I'd just be like, whatever.
[124:22.44]I don't care.
[124:29.62]Have jam or Nutella, you sicko.
[124:31.61]I'm not on the Nutella bullshit, by the way.
[124:33.57]I know Nutella.
[124:36.01]Nutella!
[124:37.53]No, no.
[124:38.15]Peanut butter's better.
[124:38.69]Nutella.
[124:44.55]I like it.
[124:45.09]It's fine.
[124:46.47]But I mean, I'm not on board with the meme.
[124:57.19]What even is Nutella?
[125:00.05]Riddle me that.
[125:03.55]What's Nutella?
[125:05.48]It's like chocolate and hazelnut, right?
[125:07.70]Actually, that sounds fucking awesome.
[125:10.98]You guys know?
[125:13.65]I'm not making this up.
[125:15.25]I swear to God.
[125:17.34]I am promising this to you.
[125:22.14]I've never, ever had Nutella.
[125:27.64]Like at the house.
[125:28.82]Or like out of the jar.
[125:30.87]I've never had it.
[125:34.01]I've had it if it was in something else.
[125:37.77]If it was like part of something else.
[125:39.01]I've never eaten it.
[125:44.37]I know that's insane for a lot of you guys.
[125:46.33]Like, you can't believe it, some of you.
[125:48.04]But no, I've never had it.
[125:50.18]I definitely have had, I've consumed it before.
[125:52.08]Oh yeah, this has Nutella in it.
[125:53.74]It's like part of a dessert recipe or something, definitely.
[125:57.16]But never just, oh, out of the jar, Nutella.
[125:59.12]Nope.
[125:59.88]I don't think that's ever happened.
[126:07.69]Sacrifice a follower?
[126:08.85]Uh-oh, told you.
[126:13.42]Have you ever had Marmite?
[126:14.49]Yes.
[126:18.03]I have.
[126:19.03]And I don't like it.
[126:19.65]I think it's gross.
[126:25.63]Wait, is Marmite Vegemite?
[126:26.71]Is that the same thing?
[126:33.43]No.
[126:33.70]Wait, I've had one but not the other, I think.
[126:35.76]What's the difference?
[126:45.22]It's not the same, but it's in the same realm, right?
[126:49.97]I think I have had... I've definitely had both.
[126:55.47]What's the one that tastes like solid soy sauce?
[126:58.59]Because that's the one that I don't like.
[126:59.65]Did both like that?
[127:14.91]That's Marmite.
[127:17.11]Yeah, it's a solid soy sauce.
[127:20.82]I'm actually not a big fan of soy sauce.
[127:23.90]It's kind of too overpowering for me.
[127:36.95]What's wrong?
[127:37.95]Oh, they're hungry.
[127:40.21]I got it.
[127:40.53]I got it.
[127:40.81]I got it.
[127:41.05]I know.
[127:43.32]This place is gross.
[127:45.30]Yuck.
[127:48.14]How about stringy meat gruel?
[127:51.63]Berry bowl and... Here.
[127:53.41]Come and get it.
[127:56.81]What's wrong?
[128:03.41]What's going on?
[128:06.41]Um...
[128:23.03]Um, oh.
[128:29.15]Who hasn't eaten?
[128:38.54]It's alright, whatever.
[128:42.62]Level up!
[128:47.24]Cult level two.
[128:48.72]Yeah.
[128:55.52]Unlock the rest of this shit.
[128:56.64]I need to save and quit.
[129:02.18]It's a bug.
[129:02.78]Okay.
[129:06.36]Halt upgraded.
[129:07.52]Oh, yeah.
[129:35.89]There we go.
[129:36.29]OK, I need to do this and poop everywhere.
[129:47.25]Is there OK?
[129:57.90]As one more.
[130:01.66]The one person that actually went behind the rocks.
[130:10.27]How's everybody doing?
[130:10.79]I need to do a ritual.
[130:18.87]But first, let's do this.
[130:32.70]Oh, strawberries.
[130:35.42]Whatever these are.
[130:46.85]How we doing?
[130:52.02]Build an outhouse so I can poop in peace.
[130:53.80]OK.
[130:59.24]Um.
[131:01.36]Oh right, I want to do this.
[131:02.26]Farmer station allows followers to water nearby crops.
[131:07.96]Put seeds here.
[131:09.03]Oh yeah, let's do that first.
[131:11.27]Farm's gonna be over here.
[131:11.95]And then somebody can water.
[131:18.41]them one and two right there.
[131:22.53]Let's go.
[131:34.48]It's not close enough to the farm plots?
[131:35.78]How is that not close enough?
[131:36.56]It's right here.
[131:41.86]Isn't it...
[131:48.15]It has to be over the plot?
[131:50.71]Oh, well, I can move it, right?
[131:57.06]You guys said I could move anything, right?
[132:07.27]Is it?
[132:09.39]Yeah, you can move it.
[132:10.21]Alright, so what's the problem?
[132:16.82]Oh, all right, please give me a break.
[132:22.74]Well, I'll just I'm going to move the the farm will grow this way and I'll replant everything.
[132:33.82]I'll put it right here for now.
[132:38.46]I'll just replant everything later.
[132:53.94]Move the plants, yeah.
[132:56.52]This game's really, really fun.
[133:11.80]I like that there's more than just the binding of Isaac.
[133:15.96]There's this whole management mode, which is really cool.
[133:21.14]Alright, let's go to the build menu.
[133:25.18]And you said I can move stuff.
[133:26.34]Edit buildings.
[133:26.90]Okay.
[133:27.00]Yeah, there we go.
[133:33.18]Okay.
[133:42.53]Will you move with the bag or am I going to make you angry?
[133:47.39]Oh, that's not.
[133:47.89]All right.
[133:48.33]Well, whatever.
[133:48.77]You'll get up.
[133:49.17]You'll figure it out.
[133:51.07]I'll get up and figure it out, right?
[133:55.56]I want this to be like that, yeah.
[133:57.20]No, like this.
[134:07.01]I didn't steal this bed.
[134:10.59]It was simply moved.
[134:11.47]Okay.
[134:17.36]Alright, that's good.
[134:25.71]cause it some seeds.
[134:30.75]OK, cool.
[134:33.53]Cool.
[134:35.03]Now wait, this is too.
[134:36.47]It's too late to do a ritual.
[134:43.44]Yarmer.
[134:47.62]Hardest to level up.
[134:48.54]Alright, now I have to kill this kill this person.
[134:59.77]You're gonna tend to the farm?
[135:01.31]Oh shit, I need one, two, I need two more.
[135:12.96]Just fill it out.
[135:21.44]The one that makes you lose, yeah, who, who's the, who's the weakest link here?
[135:24.38]No, I wanna build.
[135:35.68]Okay, so... I think it's gonna be you.
[135:43.07]Oh, yeah.
[135:43.53]Goodbye.
[135:43.81]Okay, now... Welcome to the team.
[135:51.45]It's really nice to meet you.
[135:55.62]You can, um...

[136:06.02]How many more people are there?
[136:07.86]Shit!
[136:17.52]Marbury.
[136:20.65]Oh, that farm's fine.
[136:21.49]Okay.
[136:26.77]Okay.
[136:27.59]Ooh!
[136:28.87]Good.
[136:36.60]I go, um, worship.
[136:38.73]What do you want?
[136:42.59]When times are tough, we can cook grass meals.
[136:44.63]Followers won't like it, but it beats starving.
[136:49.14]Make him eat grass?
[136:50.86]Okay.
[136:53.76]How's everybody doing?
[136:54.38]I need another bed.
[136:57.74]No, wait.
[136:58.16]Somebody has to die.
[137:13.34]Um, in here.
[137:17.34]Need to do a ritual, right?
[137:20.31]Okay.
[137:21.89]Bonfire ritual?
[137:22.91]Okay, sacrifice.
[137:26.81]Who's dying?
[137:34.14]They're all level 1.
[137:43.66]Who had all the awful shit?
[137:46.24]You did.
[137:46.54]Hey.
[137:57.19]Have a nice life.
[137:58.19]I didn't know it was going to be that violent.
[138:08.18]What's the difficulty?
[138:08.82]It's not hard.
[138:12.96]Cool.
[138:13.90]Thank you.
[138:15.72]There's much more you can take from them.
[138:19.47]Give them gifts, complete quests, and perform blessings for them and you will increase their loyalty.
[138:22.93]Once they are totally loyal to you, they will give you everything they own.
[138:28.35]Watch as I show you.
[138:29.21]Follower, come back in here.
[138:36.87]Increase a follower's loyalty to level them up and they will reward you with devotion and a commandment stone fragment.
[138:43.66]Each time a follower levels up, they will generate additional devotion when at a sermon.
[138:47.48]Okay.
[138:48.64]Increase their loyalty to give the follower a blessing once a day when you interact with them.
[138:54.67]We'll give them gifts, complete quests, and perform sermons.
[138:58.07]Okay.
[138:59.25]I got it.
[139:02.26]I have much to teach you.
[139:03.54]I'm old and grow weary.
[139:04.52]Visit me at my home and I will show you how to harness the true power of the Red Crown.
[139:11.72]An overworld map?
[139:14.32]Okay.
[139:16.54]You sacrificed Murbri.
[139:18.43]Your followers are uneasy about it.
[139:29.78]How you guys doing?
[139:33.06]What's that above their head?
[139:35.78]What's that mean?
[139:39.63]Oh, it's the amount.
[139:40.37]Okay, when they actually put one in.
[139:41.53]Okay, I got it.
[139:41.89]How's everybody on food?
[139:44.21]Maybe make a little bit of food?
[139:48.47]Basic variable.
[139:49.33]Okay.
[139:59.91]Alright, there if you want it.
[140:01.43]See you later.
[140:01.79]Do a sermon.
[140:07.27]After they eat, I will.
[140:18.94]Alright, you're good.
[140:20.08]Alright, let's do a sermon.
[140:30.77]So I can just do this once a day.
[140:31.65]Nice.
[140:35.91]Might as well just get it.
[140:57.91]If you level up the followers, you'll get more.
[141:00.11]Ooh.
[141:01.55]Oh, they liked that.
[141:13.70]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[141:15.08]I'm gonna do one more run, and then we're gonna move on to... We're gonna play Two Point Campus.
[141:22.66]So let's do one more run.
[141:23.52]I'm gonna... I will play this again, though.
[141:24.82]This game's awesome.
[141:31.09]You'll definitely see this game again.
[141:44.12]Or depending on how long this takes.
[141:47.56]Yeah, maybe I'll just save it.
[141:49.40]We'll just move to two point camp in a minute.
