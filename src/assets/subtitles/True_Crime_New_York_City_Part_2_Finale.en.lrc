[00:50.14]Where's Jorma's snort?
[00:55.06]I didn't promise you were going to get it in one day.
[00:57.02]I may have said it was going to be one day, but remember, I'm in dog years.
[01:03.16]So one day for me is 68 days.
[01:07.06]That's a long time.
[01:10.34]One year for me is seven years.
[01:14.07]You guys didn't know I was a dog?
[01:16.35]Now you know.
[01:20.11]You got like the stupid burp fire emote in place of it for now.
[01:23.75]Hold on.
[01:24.43]I'll be right back.
[01:42.42]Okay, so... I apologize in advance.
[01:45.66]I might be a little eggy today.
[01:48.57]I just ate four hard-boiled eggs.
[01:51.53]And, you know, I regretted the fourth one.
[01:54.21]I was sitting there eating three.
[01:56.35]The fourth one was ready to be peeled, and I was like, I don't know if I want to do four right now, but I did it anyways.
[02:02.99]So, I got a heavy stomach of four eggs in me.
[02:07.39]It's really good brain food.
[02:09.01]Highly recommend you eat it.
[02:11.27]But they can be heavy if you have too many.
[02:13.99]So...
[02:17.35]Got my coffee here, I'm ready to go.
[02:19.23]We're gonna continue what we were doing two days ago in True Crime, New York City.
[02:25.14]Hopefully we have more fun, because the game is fun.
[02:28.18]Did not do any FPS fix.
[02:30.62]Actually did a little bit more research, I'm not sure it is faster.
[02:35.46]I think we've been placeboing ourselves the whole time.
[02:39.09]Maybe, I don't know.
[02:41.91]You could have spent your egg time making jermaSnort.
[02:46.29]No.
[02:48.28]No, I told you that I had... Don't worry, we're gonna fill every emote slot.
[02:55.13]Probably within the next few weeks.
[02:57.29]Every slot will probably be filled.
[03:04.77]Please snort.
[03:06.37]You'll see it eventually, maybe.
[03:08.88]If I'm feeling up to it.
[03:11.14]But anyways, we're ready to go.
[03:12.58]Game is ready to launch.
[03:14.00]We're going to have to do the last mission again.
[03:15.66]And hopefully, watch this turn into a stream where I can't beat this next mission.
[03:19.46]I wouldn't be surprised.
[03:22.20]What about new subsounds?
[03:23.40]Dude, yeah, that's right.
[03:25.25]That's true.
[03:25.97]New subsounds?
[03:27.19]It's not like there's been seven other Hearthstone expansions.
[03:30.39]I don't even play Hearthstone.
[03:31.63]I don't understand.
[03:32.19]I really don't.
[03:37.17]Don't ask me why.
[03:41.51]Play Hearthstone.
[03:42.75]Whoa!
[03:43.41]Okay, that was kind of loud.
[03:44.77]Wasn't really prepared for that.
[03:50.26]It's funny because I stopped playing Hearthstone before that card came up.
[03:54.76]You know how fucking stupid that is?
[03:58.12]So let's just get right to it.
[04:01.84]I may have downloaded a couple more weapons.
[04:06.26]I may have downloaded... Is somebody in the backseat?
[04:08.15]No, that's my chair moving around.
[04:13.10]And I may have downloaded into the trunk a couple of weapons.
[04:17.68]Is this louder than it was yesterday?
[04:19.04]I think it is.
[04:22.65]This is definitely louder than it was yesterday.
[04:24.81]I might have to turn it down just a little bit.
[04:29.29]Driving on the right side of the road today.
[04:31.47]Turning over a new leaf.
[04:34.13]Not going to do any more of that.
[04:35.27]Whoa, we're on the wrong side of the road!
[04:36.91]We're going to be on the right side of the road.
[04:38.88]You know what I'm saying?
[04:43.92]I would assume we're probably... I would assume we're probably going to get close to the end of the game tonight.
[04:50.18]I don't know.
[04:55.01]Pretty good weave.
[04:59.47]Yeah, I can't see this.
[05:01.21]Somebody's blowing cigarette smoke into my face.
[05:05.59]This thing is going to blow.
[05:07.25]This thing is going to blow.
[05:08.45]I have to ditch this.
[05:09.27]But my weapons are in the trunk.
[05:11.01]Alright, slow it down.
[05:15.75]Somebody is, in fact, obstructing my view.
[05:20.20]I have to be nice here.
[05:26.28]That guy stopped on a dime.
[05:29.48]That was great.
[05:36.50]Uh, one bump and this is over.
[05:38.59]So, just be aware.
[05:41.21]What?
[05:42.51]Oh, hello moto.
[05:52.48]Every time I hear the hello moto, that... I just think of that four strength, four stam, leather belt guy.
[06:00.33]Remember that Ventrilo video?
[06:04.94]I don't know why it's what I think about.
[06:09.46]You'll hear it.
[06:10.04]Get out.
[06:14.68]I knew it!
[06:16.24]I knew it, that's why I got out in time.
[06:18.82]Alright, I got out in time.
[06:22.90]Police.
[06:23.27]Police, this is loud.
[06:24.89]Hold on, turn it down.
[06:26.03]This is too loud for me to even pay attention.
[06:31.76]Hello, mutter.
[06:34.20]You have the right to one phone call.
[06:36.43]Maybe I can lace you with something.
[06:38.15]We can sweep this under the rug.
[06:39.73]What?
[06:41.15]Is that better?
[06:43.35]Maybe a little.
[06:45.65]You better hope I don't fuck it up too bad.
[06:47.32]Officer to dispatch.
[06:48.58]Situation's resolved.
[06:49.50]What the hell?
[06:51.26]I forgot you have to prove you're a cop to these guys.
[06:58.95]Did I know that Criken did a permadeath run on WoW?
[07:03.50]That's funny.
[07:05.74]You know, if I was to do something like that, a WoW permadeath, actually... I would just multi-box five different people.
[07:15.46]And just roleplay as a family.
[07:19.45]My one character would be five characters.
[07:25.37]Got it.
[07:27.55]Oh, shit.
[07:29.69]What happened?
[07:34.05]God damn it, I... No, I'm forever a ghost.
[07:44.32]Well, we should... And I got a broken leg.
[07:48.92]Hey, look, it fixed itself.
[07:57.59]Did I just fix the frame rate issue by doing that?
[08:01.01]No, I didn't, did I?
[08:01.73]Alright, we have to beat up these guys again.
[08:05.03]That must be it.
[08:05.65]I need help.
[08:07.60]Yeah, we gotta beat these people up again.
[08:12.68]I gotta focus, because these guys actually are not that easy.
[08:18.40]We already saw this cutscene.
[08:19.68]That was a one-hit kill.
[08:28.44]Hit him.
[08:29.80]I want to make this clean.
[08:35.63]Clean.
[08:38.61]Clean.
[08:40.39]Holy shit.
[08:42.07]I'm doing very well.
[08:43.25]Look guys at the knives.
[08:50.28]Come on.
[08:50.62]I want this to be clean.
[08:51.84]Not clean.
[08:59.27]Here comes the next guy.
[09:02.39]Shit.
[09:02.95]Shit.
[09:07.04]Oh, fucking come on.
[09:12.30]Perfect.
[09:17.00]Better.
[09:17.24]Alright, give me a knife.
[09:18.18]This is the last of the boss of the stupid fucking fireball thing.
[09:23.21]Defeat the leader.
[09:34.33]Don't even let him get up.
[09:35.01]Right in the groin.
[09:46.19]How's that not hitting him?
[09:51.70]Come on.
[09:52.72]I don't know what that does.
[09:54.28]Alright, here we go.
[09:55.68]I have to shoot the shit out of everybody.
[10:00.70]We got the evidence.
[10:02.52]Arrest people.
[10:04.34]This is the part of the game where we lost over and over again.
[10:06.64]I don't know how I'm going to try to... I don't know what to do.
[10:10.88]Last time we did this, didn't work out so well.
[10:13.43]There's the arrests.
[10:17.37]Is he under arrest?
[10:18.59]No, whatever.
[10:20.21]Okay.
[10:22.03]We are now at the point where I can pray that we do this.
[10:25.25]I'm going to try this first try.
[10:30.68]Yeah, try to believe in me.
[10:34.03]Believe in me.
[10:38.03]Here we go.
[10:39.29]I'm just gonna try to lock on.
[10:42.53]Bring it on.
[10:43.20]My life is fucking insane.
[10:55.27]Yeah, so far so good.
[10:58.75]I'm just gonna be quiet and just let Jax take over.
[11:02.95]Stop it!
[11:16.26]Stop walking onto the thing that's dead!
[11:17.58]Okay.
[11:21.28]No grenade launcher.
[11:22.00]Don't even tell me.
[11:23.00]It doesn't exist.
[11:23.78]I know it doesn't exist.
[11:26.34]You can't fool me.
[11:27.58]What the fuck was that?
[11:35.37]Alright, that worked.
[11:39.57]Okay, we go over the jump.

[25:10.78]Thank God.
[25:11.88]Why was that guy standing in the middle of the road with his hands up?
[25:15.74]Hahaha.
[25:22.52]What the hell is that for?
[25:24.20]Alright, when am I going to get the call that I did everything correctly?
[25:29.71]What am I doing?
[25:30.23]I just told somebody to bring it on.
[25:33.33]I don't know who that was.
[25:34.01]I think I already got it back.
[25:37.31]Let's go.
[25:38.13]Goodbye.
[25:46.76]Whoa!
[25:47.18]Oh!
[25:52.05]He's a gun-wielding employee.
[25:58.04]Apprehend him.
[25:59.18]Don't let him get away.
[26:01.30]Easy, watch out for the pedestrians.
[26:02.34]He's not a pedestrian, he's a criminal.
[26:06.20]Crapped him.
[26:06.56]Nope.
[26:06.66]Alright, I'm bringing out the gun for this one.
[26:17.69]Really?
[26:18.79]No, don't hit the lady.
[26:23.22]How do you get shot twice and you're still up?
[26:29.63]Got it.
[26:32.35]Alright, keep going.
[26:36.67]This game doesn't stop delivering.
[26:38.25]It really is.
[26:39.37]It's just so great.
[26:45.46]Everything about this game is fun.
[26:48.68]It's such a mess, but it's a beautiful mess.
[26:53.92]Jesus Christ, no!
[27:00.87]Don't.
[27:05.01]And?
[27:09.21]You brought in the prostitutes, and what happened?
[27:13.04]You were going to follow up with me there, but you stopped talking.
[27:15.72]Why?
[27:20.96]Sorry, we'll get to the next mission up here.
[27:27.00]Okay.
[27:27.92]Are there no jumps in this game?
[27:29.10]I feel like there would be a lot of cool jumps to do.
[27:30.98]Got another Prime on the radar.
[27:36.47]Not gonna do it.
[27:37.79]We got more things to do here.
[27:40.09]More places to see.
[27:43.71]I'm driving too fast?
[27:46.01]Not anymore.
[27:46.85]Now I can drive as fast as I want!
[27:48.39]I was gonna make a parting the Red Sea joke.
[27:57.00]But, you know, you could have already made it.
[28:00.20]Somebody somehow did.
[28:04.34]It makes it worse.
[28:05.12]It makes it worse.
[28:06.66]It really does make it worse.
[28:10.02]Get out of here.
[28:12.54]Get out of the way.
[28:15.30]Get out of the way.
[28:19.82]Thank you.
[28:25.74]Take the subway.
[28:29.61]Not a bad idea.
[28:30.25]I could actually utilize the subway system in this game.
[28:36.35]Next time.
[28:37.19]I'll do it.
[28:37.79]I'll get on the subway.
[28:38.55]We'll take the train.
[28:46.35]Salt on pimp by angry prostitutes.
[28:49.43]Wait, you're all in trouble.
[28:51.33]Get down.
[28:55.01]Honestly, anytime you show the badge, it's just, hey, now let's beat this guy up.
[29:03.52]Nobody ever listens to you when you show the badge.
[29:05.58]It's just a way to aggro every enemy.
[29:17.71]Rude driver.
[29:18.35]Where'd you get the Philly Club?
[29:19.59]Bad enough.
[29:20.31]No, don't steal an ambulance.
[29:21.95]Okay, they're trapped here.
[29:23.41]Fuck.

[29:53.82]Oh, you are.
[29:55.74]Get ready to meet... My life!
[29:58.08]My life is in danger!
[29:59.14]Yep.
[29:59.58]Oh, fuck.
[30:01.52]Damn it.
[30:01.90]I was gonna aim at her.
[30:02.76]I didn't have the gun out.
[30:04.46]I was trying to be a good cop by saying my life was presently in immediate danger, so I had to do that.
[30:14.17]Whatever.
[30:14.53]Let's go.
[30:20.73]Does anybody ever follow any rules here?
[30:32.58]How did that kill them?
[30:33.36]That shouldn't have killed them.
[30:34.82]You tell me I just killed those guys by bumping into them going like five miles per hour.
[30:45.49]I'm just trying to bump him.
[30:46.83]Why are these guys... Come on!
[30:50.36]Give me a break!

[46:38.00]Easy enough.
[46:44.98]Alright, I got a full health kit down there.
[46:47.52]We spent so much time trying to put them in the meat grinder that, I mean, it's gonna be hard to put everybody in there.
[46:51.60]I think you can only do it once.
[47:01.80]Hopefully you break their back when they go in there too.
[47:14.07]Don't get caught.
[47:15.41]Don't get caught up easy.
[47:16.39]Alright, that's cool.
[47:29.04]No, no, no, no, don't hit me with that.

[47:36.70]Alright, you're done.
[47:41.38]One more guy.

[47:50.17]Might as well.
[47:56.43]Okay.
[47:57.15]He's dead.
[47:57.49]He's not over yet.
[48:01.74]One more group?
[48:03.44]How could you let this guy do a Bloodborne dodge to you?
[48:09.28]Come on, man.
[48:11.04]Yeah, I can't.
[48:18.50]You can't do it.
[48:20.16]You can only do it to one guy.
[48:22.22]That's too bad.
[48:26.07]Let me get the health.
[48:28.69]These things are all blinking for some reason.
[48:32.33]Arrest him.
[48:36.79]Table, table, table, table.
[48:38.61]You want me to, like, scoop slam him through a table?
[48:41.99]Table, table, table.
[48:45.39]It's alright, there's gonna be another guy right here.
[48:50.97]There he is.
[48:56.12]I don't have any guns.
[48:58.80]These guys all have guns.
[49:00.40]Explain how this is fair for me right now.
[49:02.55]Gun?
[49:02.99]There's a gun.
[49:03.51]Oh, there's a room full of guns over there.
[49:06.55]Three, two, one, go.
[49:12.16]Okay, there's a problem.
[49:29.52]I can't fucking move.

[49:33.14]I just... Nope.
[49:38.96]Man, getting out of this one.
[49:52.61]I don't think there's any now.
[49:53.66]I have to do this whole thing again.
[49:57.92]Defeated by pressing C against the wall.
[50:02.21]Press C?
[50:03.50]You don't think I've done it like a thousand times by now?
[50:34.03]No, this is bad.
[50:35.13]I need to die.
[50:37.51]Because the actual save file is before this mission starts.
[50:44.61]Oh, that's so bad.
[50:45.47]There's nothing I can do here.
[50:58.02]If you load this save... No, no, no.

[65:58.80]This guy sounds like Steve Carell.
[66:14.13]What Steve Carell movie are we watching?
[66:15.79]I feel like he's screaming in Bruce Almighty.
[66:29.78]Where are we?
[66:30.22]Over here?
[66:33.08]Let's go, tough guy.
[66:42.11]Turn him around.

[77:22.63]You've gotta be fucking serious, man.
[77:25.07]The arrest button is the dive button.
[77:32.80]You walk over and you arrest him, but it dives at you.
[77:34.92]Oh my God.
[77:51.69]The arrest button is the dive button.

[92:26.78]Okay, we're good.
[92:31.84]Alright.
[92:33.00]That brings us to here.

[94:03.99]Save game.
[94:05.79]Yeah, save it like right here.

[94:17.78]Alright, here we go.

[97:44.61]I'm gonna teach you a lesson.
[97:49.01]This car really is too fast.
[97:50.79]It just is.
[97:53.31]We're gonna go this way.
[97:59.86]Move, motherfuckers!
[98:00.90]Police!
[98:01.42]What the hell?
[98:03.90]Crime resolved.
[98:05.04]This thing is screaming.
[98:12.68]Nobody went through a windshield.
[98:18.56]Don't ask me how.
[98:20.30]Drift that shit.
[98:21.24]Okay, I will.
[98:25.24]Drift.
[98:25.62]I mean, I drifted into other people.
[98:39.79]I'm gonna drift around the corner over here.
[98:41.19]Ready?
[98:41.41]1... 2... Hey, nobody saw that, right?
[98:47.55]Tell me I'll drift!
[98:56.82]Oh, shit!
[98:57.96]Jesus!
[98:59.20]Yeah, I definitely turned into a maniac.
[99:03.60]When everybody said that I was doing it on purpose, I, like, would turn into a maniac.
[99:14.21]This thing is insane.
[99:20.17]Watch out!
[99:20.68]I'm trying to go that way.
[99:36.04]Woohoo.
[99:38.46]It just feels like I have God Mode on.
[99:41.46]This is what it feels like to have God Mode on in a game.
[99:45.43]We're good.
[99:51.16]What do you got?
[99:52.10]What do you got for me?
[99:54.64]Yo, what kind of place is this, money?
[99:57.26]Look like something out of a movie or some shit.
[99:59.66]This den here goes back to the 1800s, man.
[100:01.74]So I come back and I say, hey, it's got all kinds of secret doors and passages and shit.
[100:06.87]Man, you gotta be shitting me, right?
[100:09.09]Dumb Uncle Benny was gonna open it to the public for free.
[100:11.91]You can't blame him, though.
[100:12.75]You've done stuff like that in the past.
[100:14.29]It's hard to tell.
[100:15.15]I'm serious, though.
[100:17.05]I swear to God.
[100:19.20]The game is just hard to control and... I even took off my gunner optics in the middle of that and I shouldn't have because they're headache reducing.
[100:31.24]That guy doesn't even look real.
[100:32.56]Uh oh.
[100:32.76]Do I know this guy?
[101:03.14]Did I care about that guy?
[101:04.88]Did I know that guy?
[101:10.24]I guess.
[101:12.54]Alright, here we go.
[101:13.76]Apprehend Leland.
[101:16.81]Please just don't make me climb up a bunch of shit.
[101:22.85]What?
[101:23.83]Okay, got it.
[101:24.37]Good call.
[101:27.21]Oh, God.
[101:27.93]Don't... This is just the same thing over and over again.
[101:33.56]This is just Blighttown.
[101:35.26]Oh, no.
[101:36.00]Plenty of places to fall.
[101:37.08]Alright, this is... Okay, we got a bulk hip.
[101:43.39]I'll kill you.
[101:45.35]Oh, no.
[101:46.51]Don't even give this... Tiny little cord.
[101:50.67]See, this is... And the camera doesn't help.
[101:52.09]It... I'm not gonna complain about it.
[101:54.44]Oh, give me this.
[101:58.76]What the fuck... Was that?
[102:04.51]Guys on a zipline?
[102:06.47]Oh, there are ziplines, oh.
[102:07.39]Ugh.
[102:37.82]Dammit.
[102:40.59]There was a chance.
[102:41.41]Where am I getting shot from?
[102:57.64]Reloaded.
[102:58.08]I only got a few bullets left in this thing though.
[103:00.66]I didn't even try.
[103:08.99]Imagine if I killed him from that far away.
[103:15.21]Alright, well, did not expect to see you.
[103:17.33]Now it's shooting the gun automatically like it did last time.
[103:21.85]Okay, keep going.
[103:28.35]Imagine going into the sewers the day you decide to wear your all-white tracksuit.
[103:38.44]Oh wait, I don't want to get dirty!
[103:42.90]Tactical shotgun.
[103:45.26]I don't want the tactical shotgun, but I guess I have to use it now.
[103:48.92]We good?
[103:56.46]Alright.
[103:57.60]Slide.
[104:00.95]Using aimbot?
[104:02.63]I am not using aimbot.
[104:04.59]I'll kill you!
[104:15.11]What are these guys doing?
[104:29.14]Goodbye!
[104:31.82]They made that easy.
[104:34.06]Speaking of, uh, where the hell am I supposed to go from here?
[104:36.92]Down?
[104:40.80]Climb down it and then around the corner?
[104:43.52]I guess.
[104:43.90]I don't know.
[104:50.16]Uh-huh.
[104:54.98]I hate jumps like that.
[104:56.02]I really do.
[104:56.50]Something's about to jump off.
[105:00.65]Weapon?
[105:01.49]I'll take the new assault rifle.
[105:07.69]Is that...
[105:15.30]I didn't get them.
[105:28.75]Yeah, say hi to Uncle Benny, motherfucker.
[105:32.85]Did you know that Tom was born in this room?
[105:35.23]I feel like we skipped ahead a couple hours in the movie.
[105:40.19]Benny was the only one who still knew about this place.
[105:42.95]Yeah, he didn't want to share the secret, but I made him tell me.
[105:46.11]He wasn't the only one, Leland.
[105:48.47]What are you doing?
[105:50.51]I know you and your mother plotted to murder my father.
[105:53.34]Maybe this cop will give you what you deserve.
[105:56.05]It is just like one of these all over again.
[106:02.31]Look at the spear.
[106:05.25]Do I get one too?
[106:06.43]Are we doing the mountain versus the viper?
[106:15.04]Not necessarily fair.
[106:16.20]Alright, that...
[106:31.17]Get away from me!
[106:31.79]Get away from that thing!
[106:35.96]Is there a spear?
[106:36.50]I need to look around the room for a sec.
[106:37.72]Hold on.
[106:38.06]Just stay there.
[106:45.96]What the f- This isn't fair!
[106:47.82]Hey, he's just kicking the shit out of me!
[106:53.43]Alright, I need- I need an item!
[106:56.27]Items?
[106:59.74]Hot pot.
[107:00.28]Hot pot of coffee.
[107:01.34]Hot pot of coffee.
[107:03.66]Go up the rope.
[107:09.86]Alright.
[107:15.64]Playtime's over.
[107:29.84]Okay, he's going up the rope.
[107:33.58]Um... Understood.
[107:36.73]Do I get to do that too?
[107:42.97]Uh... Where's my funny rope?
[107:59.04]Um...
[108:03.53]Do I just have to rot down here for all eternity?
[108:05.99]Is there a button or something?
[108:12.19]I don't think this makes any sense.
[108:15.42]So I've got to climb up the wall.
[108:18.36]Like my hands are made out of plungers.
[108:21.58]And now he's dropping a crate on me.
[108:24.58]Well, okay.
[108:25.24]So he's going to do that.
[108:26.79]This was one of Benny's favorite pieces.
[108:28.67]I could give a shit.
[108:33.34]Where is he getting all this stuff?
[108:38.50]Where did he go?
[108:39.52]What is this guy doing?
[108:45.37]Can I throw something at him?
[108:47.71]No.
[108:48.01]I just have to walk across the gauntlet.
[108:50.39]Yeah, more steam and a nice funhouse.
[108:53.13]This is great.
[109:01.61]I'm up here, smart guy.
[109:02.62]Why don't you come and arrest me?
[109:03.42]I don't want to climb up.
[109:04.12]Hold on, there's evidence over here.
[109:05.04]Let me collect it.
[109:09.28]Nothing else.
[109:09.76]Yeah, we just have to avoid the... That isn't going to do it.
[109:18.26]There's going to be bigger boxes this time too, isn't it?
[109:24.70]Of course, I'm going to die.
[109:29.94]Did he get hurt?
[109:31.65]Oh, I thought he got hurt by his own thing.
[109:36.67]Alright, more evidence.
[109:38.13]Health, that's desperate.
[109:56.59]No, not more of this.
[109:58.11]Not more of this goddamn Legends of the Hidden Temple bullshit.
[110:04.47]Another wall to climb up.
[110:10.14]I really don't want to do this another time.
[110:13.90]Let's make it clean.
[110:22.50]Fall Joker Riot.
[110:23.74]No.
[110:24.54]I'm sorry.
[110:27.34]I'm not going to do a fall joke now.
[110:29.26]I can't.
[110:29.70]Oh.
[110:29.92]Oh well.
[110:30.70]Why does he keep doing the Michael Jackson thing?
[110:40.67]He's like... That's $100.
[110:41.53]From...
[110:55.82]Is that another long tube to go across?
[110:58.94]First of all, hold on a minute.
[111:01.85]Cigarette spaghetti just gave $100.
[111:05.35]Fall joke or riot?
[111:08.83]No.
[111:10.63]No.
[111:11.17]Thank you for the hundred fucking dollars, dude, but this is so, so much money.
[111:17.36]No, dude, look at how much further I have to go.
[111:19.02]We're at the end.
[111:22.59]Thank you so much, dude.
[111:23.71]I can't fall right now.
[111:26.25]This is a long, drawn-out mission.
[111:28.91]Thank you so much for your $100, though.
[111:30.35]Yo, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[111:33.95]I know.
[111:34.27]I know you're upset about this, everybody.
[111:35.69]Yo, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[111:39.92]No, I can't.
[111:41.06]I'm not doing it.
[111:42.78]I love that $100.
[111:44.98]Thank you.
[111:45.50]I love you.
[111:47.78]No.
[111:49.68]I'm not gonna do it.
[111:52.65]You can't do this to me.
[111:53.73]I love that.
[111:58.41]$100.
[111:58.45]Do I have to fight him now?
[112:03.07]Will he climb over here?
[112:08.64]This is scary.
[112:11.84]There he goes.
[112:12.24]There he goes.
[112:12.56]It was hit single.
[112:14.92]There it is.
[112:15.36]It's James Brown.
[112:18.02]I feel good.
[112:23.32]I'm gonna get this guy run over by the train.
[112:33.95]Oh, more money.
[112:36.95]Hold on.
[112:41.03]Last minute!
[112:42.40]Whoa!
[112:43.02]What?
[112:45.04]How did you not get hit by that?
[112:46.30]I gotta do the dive out of the way.
[112:47.76]He's gonna get hit by the train, dude.
[112:52.97]This way.
[112:54.01]Okay, and then last second I'm gonna dive.
[113:03.20]He's as smart as I am.
[113:04.32]Okay, here we go.
[113:12.92]God damn it!
[113:13.68]How are you that smart?
[113:19.28]You shouldn't be that intelligent.
[113:27.63]God damn it!
[113:28.25]Holy shit, I almost died.
[113:31.49]I need a weapon or something.
[113:34.77]Honest to God, please don't lose here.
[113:37.79]I have no weapons or anything.
[113:44.13]Got it.
[113:46.11]Doesn't even matter.
[113:47.25]Can't even hurt him.
[114:07.83]This is such an unfair fight.
[114:09.79]I've never seen such an unfair fight before.
[114:11.75]Sorry, I gotta concentrate.
[114:25.22]Oh my god, he just keeps breaking my arms.
[114:28.70]What's wrong with my guy here?
[114:32.05]Fucking World of Warcraft rogue.
[114:34.15]Yeah, you're gonna stun lock me with a kidney shot?
[114:37.52]I gotta run off by the train.
[114:48.09]Jesus Christ.
[114:49.13]No, don't do the whole thing.
[114:51.21]Oh, this sucks, dude.
[114:54.02]Seriously.
[114:56.02]Oh my god.
[114:59.62]This is so unbearable.
[115:05.29]This motherfucker gets two knives, and if you punch him more than once, he breaks your arm.
[115:09.51]I don't get any weapons the entire time.
[115:16.99]God.
[115:18.39]Rogues can't use pole arms.
[115:23.87]There's a health pack back here somewhere.
[115:26.59]I just have to have full health.
[115:30.31]What a pain in the ass.
[115:34.59]I think I really might just use cheats to get through this.
[115:38.16]This is just... This hurts.
[115:49.03]Really?
[115:49.53]I'm here, man.
[115:49.97]Somebody needs to... Hold on.
[115:51.11]I gotta prove that I can do this without a problem.
[115:59.13]Yeah, I fell flat.
[115:59.83]I did fall.
[116:00.31]The donation request was met.
[116:01.69]I wish there was a way I could just have this happen already.
[116:06.44]No James Brown jokes.
[116:09.02]No Michael Jackson references.
[116:21.50]Just climb up and get him.
[116:23.80]And just try... You can't grab him.
[116:27.19]This guy's not grabbable.
[116:28.73]He cannot be grabbed.
[116:31.43]That didn't pick that up, I guess.
[116:39.45]Dude, what is this?
[116:41.60]This is supposed to be true crime streets of LA, not inside of Mayan temples.
[116:48.25]I'm supposed to be arresting people and people committing crimes.
[116:51.05]When did we get here?
[116:53.54]Climb the tower of the game.
[116:58.64]Perfect setting for a fall joke.
[116:59.98]No, no, don't tell me that.
[117:02.02]I don't want to do that.
[117:02.96]I want to get out of this.
[117:05.36]Yeah, this is in New York somewhere.
[117:06.87]Where the fuck in New York is this?
[117:08.41]I'm going to try to exploit this, by the way.
[117:19.10]I'm going to just try to ruin everything for him.
[117:22.94]I'm going to try to fight him through the wall.
[117:25.69]It's going to be possible.
[117:27.13]Come on, Marcus.
[117:28.39]Give me a challenge.
[117:29.13]I feel like I'm going to fall off this somewhere.
[117:32.75]Come on, Marcus.
[117:33.71]Give me a challenge.
[117:37.90]Come on, Marcus.
[117:39.18]Give me a challenge.
[117:40.10]I'm coming for it.
[117:42.28]Full health.
[117:42.78]He takes up the knives.
[117:44.08]He says a couple of swear words.
[117:46.06]I wonder if I can kick him in the face.
[117:48.95]You know what I mean?
[117:49.71]It's possible.
[117:56.22]So, I think maybe I can... I'm going to try to pull him.
[117:58.08]No, he's not.
[118:01.36]Can I, like, take him through the wall?
[118:05.26]I don't think I can.
[118:07.14]He's not going to accidentally get hit by the train.
[118:12.32]Hmm.
[118:12.78]Okay.
[118:13.58]I just have to beat him.
[118:16.17]I'm gonna save it here just for the in the off chance that I'm allowed to start here God that's so irritating
[118:45.44]Throw him into the train, he can't be grabbed.
[118:49.26]I can't pull anything off a wall or something.
[118:51.84]Can I spray him?
[118:52.50]Okay.
[118:58.00]He's fucked up.
[118:58.94]Good.
[118:59.80]He's gonna get hit by the train.
[119:02.18]I broke him.
[119:05.84]Zoom in.
[119:09.75]What?
[119:10.41]Fuck, man.
[119:11.15]He was just doing that thing to toy with us.
[119:28.62]Gotta get him on the ground.
[119:34.41]Don't get hit by the train.
[119:35.13]Where's it coming from?
[119:40.69]The train fixed him.
[119:42.35]Where's he going?
[119:49.84]He's messed up.
[119:51.76]Train's going to come from this side.
[119:53.30]I wonder if I can get him to get hit by it.
[119:57.26]He's currently fucking running into the wall and shit.
[119:59.68]He might not be able to make it.
[120:00.58]He's not going to be able to make it.
[120:02.60]He's freaking out.
[120:03.12]3, 2, 1.
[120:03.28]Got it.
[120:03.86]He got hit, didn't he?
[120:06.25]Yeah, he did.
[120:07.57]At least he got damage from it.
[120:10.89]Oh my god!
[120:31.09]Do I arrest him?
[120:31.89]Alright, we got another choice here.
[120:36.69]President's Club or Palermo Mob.
[121:05.37]I'm going to say the President's Club.
[121:09.70]We could do a poll, but I mean, President's Club, I think.
[121:15.33]We had a choice last time between three, but we have to do them all anyways, so...
[121:22.83]President.
[121:23.29]I'm making an executive decision.
[121:24.91]We're going to have to do them all anyways.
[121:26.67]Anyways.
[121:26.87]Topac, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[121:28.09]Ball joke.
[121:28.29]Thank you, dude.
[121:28.69]That's a lot of money.
[121:30.59]I fell.
[121:30.95]I fell down the train right over my head.
[121:33.53]Thank you, guys.
[121:52.78]took Asia by storm.
[121:54.80]Now it's in New York courtesy of this club.
[121:58.09]We've learned that the club is run by five presidents, hence the very clever name.
[122:03.79]There's Lincoln, Hamilton, Jackson, and Grant.
[122:07.11]And they all lead to Benjamin Franklin.
[122:08.43]Then there's the eye atop the pyramid, Benjamin.
[122:11.77]Speaking of pyramids, there was a time I was deployed in Egypt.
[122:15.54]Let me tell you, don't ever get into a spitting contest with a camel.
[122:20.76]Anyway, we got one solid lead here.
[122:24.16]President Lincoln runs a hell hole out in Harlem on Madison and East 124th.
[122:29.91]Benjamin wasn't a president?
[122:32.93]He was the guy that ran the president.
[122:34.97]This character is said to be a real psycho, so you should go in well armed.
[122:42.90]What a joke.
[122:45.10]Yeah.
[122:48.15]So we have to get rid of all the presidents?
[122:49.47]Is that what's going on here?
[122:55.74]Sounds good to me.
[122:57.66]Let's go find the drug den.
[122:59.98]Yo, what's really good with you, kid?
[123:04.18]Where are my weapons?
[123:06.32]This is somebody else's car.
[123:08.88]Never mind.
[123:11.53]I gotta go get Lincoln.
[123:12.51]I want a bike.
[123:16.61]Thank you.
[123:26.24]Oh, the bike exploded.
[123:28.22]From just that?
[123:28.95]It's not a... It's a pretty poorly designed bike.
[123:33.79]Alright, let's take the subway.
[123:36.93]Okay.
[123:37.33]Well, you can't really... And justice is served.
[123:40.31]This guy's got an insane weapon.
[124:01.60]Okay, let's go.
[124:03.22]That's a nice car.
[124:03.92]No, it's not.
[124:07.11]This thing is a piece of crap.
[124:13.37]This thing is rusty.
[124:14.57]I thought it was a nice car.
[124:17.39]Alright, so let me take the subway.
[124:18.55]We haven't done it once.
[124:20.76]So we need to go... Informant King.
[124:24.92]Alright, where do we need to go here?
[124:32.09]This is the fight arena.
[124:33.29]There's the informant.
[124:36.33]Subway.
[124:37.75]Do I even need to do that?
[124:40.97]Rampaging Pimp.
[124:41.61]He's still alive.
[124:42.39]Nice doing business with him.
[124:44.62]Resolved.
[125:00.22]Put the gun down, not even need to use it.
[125:03.92]Plus ten, plus ten, plus ten.
[125:04.80]Yep.
[125:04.92]Oh god.
[125:08.07]Let's get him.
[125:27.74]That person was disintegrated.
[125:29.92]That's alright.
[125:31.14]I'm gonna get on the Harley.
[125:33.93]We gotta get there quicker.
[125:34.77]Let's go.
[125:40.07]In this door here?
[125:40.53]Looks like it.
[125:56.67]I got points for this.
[125:57.69]What happened?
[125:59.09]Is this the guy?
[125:59.65]It's always the same guy.
[126:09.48]Can we put this guy away?
[126:10.44]Can we put this guy away for life, please?
[126:17.98]Seriously.
[126:19.34]I killed that guy.
[126:22.44]Why is his twin brother also a serial rapist?
[126:28.12]It's the same dude.
[126:28.96]Uh-oh.
[126:33.10]Bad news.
[126:33.62]Oh, I got rank 4, right?
[126:41.01]Almost at rank 5.
[126:41.75]Now I can buy new weapons and stuff, too.
[126:44.19]I think this is where I unlocked caltrops.
[126:58.63]You know what I mean?
[126:59.89]Looking forward to that.
[127:01.91]You know, Immortal HD, UberHack Zone Nova.
[127:04.31]I finally got it.
[127:04.89]I'm able to unlock CalProp.
[127:06.57]That was funny.
[127:07.91]Should I go there now?
[127:08.77]Maybe I should just go there now.
[127:31.62]Where is it?
[127:32.58]Police booth.
[127:34.66]Which one's closer?
[127:35.85]This one's closer.
[127:38.11]Make a waypoint.
[127:41.65]Might as well go get the new stuff and try to use our caltrops.
[127:48.69]New to Twitch, how does it work?
[127:50.19]This is a live platform, so right now, you are seeing this live.
[127:54.97]I'm sitting here downstairs in my room.
[127:59.53]I'm broadcasting what you see right now.
[128:01.43]I'm gonna move my hands up in the air.
[128:03.03]I'm doing that in real time.
[128:09.15]This is not a video.
[128:11.04]It is real time.
[128:16.66]Pre-recorded comment section.
[128:20.64]That's gonna- Made it out.
[128:23.08]Ha!
[128:23.26]Not a big deal.
[128:24.80]Police booth.
[128:25.42]Hey, there it is.
[128:29.44]Hi.
[128:30.76]Uh, turn in evidence.
[128:32.16]Sex objects.
[128:32.94]Might as well turn them in.
[128:35.16]Collect payroll.
[128:36.06]$43,000.
[128:36.08]I got 60 grand.
[128:46.80]What's wrong with this one?
[128:51.03]30,000?
[128:51.05]25,000?
[128:52.51]No, I want to go to the... I guess I have to go to the actual headquarters.
[128:55.83]Because... Where is actual police HQ?
[129:04.11]Police booth?
[129:05.58]Police booth.
[129:08.10]I can't buy anything from here?
[129:08.98]I have to actually go back to the station?
[129:11.94]You sure, detective?
[129:13.18]Cabs are real expensive these days.
[129:16.63]New York fucking police.
[129:18.61]Oh, snap.
[129:19.55]Bro, you watching this?
[129:21.17]Let's see.
[129:21.53]It's up here, right?
[129:24.61]The music store.
[129:29.43]Oh, I can keep going.
[129:30.13]Okay, so I need to go... Here it is.
[129:33.09]Police headquarters.
[129:35.93]Let's take the subway to there.
[129:40.43]I'm all the way down here.
[129:41.39]I'm gonna get on this subway and we're gonna go all the way up.
[129:45.69]Let's actually ride the train.
[129:55.70]This is a money laundering stream.
[129:58.48]I tried to find a way to make it so I could delete like 30% fees from my income.
[130:07.82]Let's ride the train.
[130:16.95]Mm-hmm.
[130:18.17]Much faster.
[130:25.37]Camera.
[130:26.39]Help me out here.
[130:27.09]Camera.
[130:27.51]Alright, good.
[130:32.99]Let's get my stun baton.
[130:36.67]How do I determine where I get to go?
[130:41.13]Oh, there we go.
[130:41.77]Okay.
[130:42.85]So, let's go to here.
[130:46.27]Oh, no.
[130:48.07]The game crashed.
[130:51.33]That is a game crash, boys and girls.
[130:58.50]God damn it.
[130:59.44]The one time I want to actually utilize the service.
[131:03.68]And I saved it.
[131:04.92]God damn it.
[131:05.38]What a pain in the ass.
[131:09.23]Well, okay.
[131:10.27]Let's reopen the game.
[131:17.46]The one time I've ever had a crash in the game is when I click on the subway, really.
[131:23.22]That's stupid.
[131:30.78]Coming back.
[131:34.04]Whoa!
[131:39.94]Jerma angry.
[131:41.28]Jerma expensive.
[131:43.41]By the way, I went to my subscription list.
[131:46.05]There are six people that have that.
[131:48.67]There might be more now, but there are six of you that have the Jerma expensive emote.
[131:54.12]Actually, this is a good thing because it puts me right in the police headquarters.
[132:06.09]Can you see it?
[132:06.79]We good?
[132:10.63]Looks like it's not capturing right now.
[132:12.74]There we go.
[132:13.22]Now it is.
[132:15.52]Alright.
[132:16.72]Let's go over here.
[132:17.56]Turn in a bunch of evidence.
[132:19.74]Any more money?
[132:20.48]I just turned in a bunch of stuff.
[132:21.92]Alright.
[132:22.46]So now do I have to talk to her?
[132:24.67]What?
[132:24.89]You just told me how you were happy with me.
[132:27.25]Alright.
[132:27.45]Whatever.
[132:27.79]Let's go get the caltrops.
[132:49.98]Those are some expensive pixels.
[132:52.82]There we go.
[132:53.67]Rank 2.
[132:54.37]So we got... There we go.
[132:56.81]We got caltrops, beanbag shotgun, flashlight.
[133:04.45]Alright, let's get it.
[133:05.79]Okay.
[133:09.93]That's fine.
[133:12.46]Rank 4, rank 2.
[133:13.72]So, enhanced precision.
[133:16.03]You can get a, uh, nah, that's awesome.
[133:19.25]Sledgehammer.
[133:22.49]BBS.
[133:24.10]Beanbag Sonic Gun.
[133:26.12]Let's get a car.
[133:29.98]Let me get a new car, a good car.
[133:32.60]Go on in.
[133:32.84]I'm gonna get, like, the Humvee.
[133:45.89]It's $20,000, $30,000.
[133:46.36]I'm not supposed to spend my money.
[133:49.72]Civilian skills.
[133:52.62]Here we go.
[133:53.46]Double tap left or right.
[133:56.33]I can get on two wheels now.
[133:57.49]Perfect.
[134:01.37]Double tap A or D and then double tap W. Yes.
[134:11.73]I'm going to have to try that.
[134:13.75]We're almost at nitro.
[134:15.07]Okay, coming right up.
[134:16.75]So we got civilian cars.
[134:19.46]I don't have any police cars.
[134:23.64]10,000, 20,000, 25,000 with 30,000.
[134:26.18]This one.
[134:27.66]Okay, detective.
[134:28.68]We'll bring it out.
[134:30.58]Look at this thing.
[134:32.16]This is souped up.
[134:39.99]So we got...
[134:42.45]Small arms.
[134:43.31]So these are, this is currently storage, right?
[134:48.35]So in theory, like I'm just confused how this whole system works.
[134:55.59]I feel like it has, this is correct, right?
[134:59.69]That's equipped, right?
[135:11.09]Yeah, because now I can't carry anything else.
[135:13.79]But how do I actually put these on?
[135:15.97]It seems weird.
[135:20.54]It seems like I can't equip them.
[135:24.98]Top is what's equipped.
[135:26.84]Yeah, I understand that, but you'll watch what happens when I try to get to them.
[135:31.96]I can't select them.
[135:39.01]Whoa, this is fast.
[135:46.84]Let me just take a look.
[135:50.96]See, like, nightstick.
[135:52.47]I don't have anything on.
[135:56.47]Let me just see what happens when I do this.
[135:58.81]Get to the trunk.
[135:59.73]Oh, my God.
[136:05.20]I want to touch the trunk.
[136:07.36]I don't want to open the car doors.
[136:09.02]I want to open the trunk.
[136:19.54]Alright, so... Space is equipped, I know, but why... This... Down here is not... Because I don't even have these on.
[136:27.50]See what I'm saying?
[136:27.98]Like, I don't have these on right now.
[136:29.36]This is what I have on my guy.
[136:30.42]See what I'm saying?
[136:33.12]It's almost like I just can't select them for some strange reason.
[136:39.80]Switching combat modes, not guns.
[136:48.00]So then how do you select different weapons?
[136:50.57]Let me look this up.
[136:53.97]Because I haven't known how to do that the whole entire game.
[137:00.21]Badge use target previous combat mode.
[137:02.97]Next offhanded weapon is T. C and T?
[137:07.91]What?
[137:08.75]End and home.
[137:11.23]What the fuck are you talking about?
[137:12.95]Home?
[137:21.48]T's not doing anything.
[137:24.74]T. Home.
[137:30.65]That ain't doing anything.
[137:38.86]Because C is crouch.
[137:41.38]So when I press C, why is it crouching?
[137:44.46]C is crouch.
[137:45.14]C is also next end.
[137:46.12]Okay, end.
[137:48.70]End.
[137:50.36]Okay, end does this.
[137:51.92]I can actually switch this with end.
[137:54.50]Home doesn't do anything, though.
[137:57.62]Hmm.
[138:02.22]It should be home or T, but it's not doing anything.
[138:10.98]Page up.
[138:14.85]Well, page up just switches between the modes.
[138:19.49]Okay, so here's what you gotta do.
[138:21.27]This is really fucking sloppy.
[138:23.63]You gotta get to like a 38, right?
[138:25.45]And then I have to hit end.
[138:28.42]It's end is how you cycle through.
[138:30.88]That's really... I don't like that at all.
[138:32.80]But how do these work?
[138:36.32]Let's try this.
[138:38.18]Okay, so now theoretically he'll drive over those, right?
[138:43.46]Now he has no tires.
[138:45.91]I guess.
[138:50.88]Alright.
[138:53.30]I wanna do it to the bus.
[138:56.20]No, backspace.
[138:57.04]I don't wanna do this.
[138:58.02]I wanna get in the car, the expensive fucking car I have.
[139:01.22]Why do I have two of these now?
[139:04.54]It gave me two of them!
[139:06.86]What?
[139:13.80]Okay.
[139:16.88]Throw it in traffic.
[139:19.10]I wonder if I have access to it.
[139:22.80]No, I can't.
[139:23.52]I can't switch from here.
[139:27.48]Yeah, I got like a hundred stone of Jordans now.
[139:36.69]Let's go to the President's Club.
[139:39.39]This is gonna be dangerous.
[139:42.59]Alright, place your bets.
[139:44.43]How far am I gonna get?
[139:50.41]There it is.
[139:51.25]That far.
[139:51.71]It's this far.
[139:53.65]God.
[139:54.71]Oh, my God.
[140:03.57]Fuck.
[140:04.21]Oh, I forgot to do the two wheels thing.
[140:21.19]Let's get up on two wheels.
[140:26.03]So it was.
[140:27.37]You gotta be kidding me.
[140:28.51]What is the point of that?
[140:30.31]What does that solve?
[140:31.29]It doesn't solve anything.
[140:35.06]This is just a joke.
[140:38.68]You'll flip the whole car over.
[140:42.26]I'm walking past.
[140:51.20]You see how cool that was, lady?
[140:59.90]That's so dumb.
[141:08.17]I don't see a reason to do that.
[141:11.11]It's for going through traffic.
[141:12.21]This is the gaping through traffic.
[141:13.39]That's not a bad idea.
[141:23.40]This is the fastest way to get there.
[141:26.81]Hey, see that cool move I just did?
[141:38.08]That's called the bunny hop.
[141:40.52]It's not bad.
[141:51.59]Hold on, they're just beating the shit out of him with bats?
[141:55.06]Oh my god.
[141:55.48]That guy's not really doing very much.
[141:57.44]Oh, I just got a strike.
[141:59.80]I just got a strike.
[142:22.66]Perfect.
[142:24.72]I would have high-fived at least two people for that one.
[142:34.61]Oh, no.
[142:35.07]They're talking about me.
[142:38.51]They're talking about me.
[142:41.09]They're talking about me.
[142:44.40]Do the mission first.
[142:45.48]I'm going to do the mission.
[142:49.54]I'll be fine.
[142:51.29]I'm almost there.
[142:51.73]Just get into the green thing.
[142:56.06]I can't hurt anybody else.
[142:57.14]I need a new car, too.
[143:06.87]This thing is going to blow very soon.
[143:12.01]No.
[143:12.41]Forget about the rampaging pimps.
[143:14.47]I'm getting out.
[143:14.89]I ain't going to lose her.
[143:25.08]Drive on the street, you egg.
[143:26.50]But I'm so far away from any streets.
[143:32.15]I should be able to take this guy out and get some value points.
[143:37.45]I think that was the probe Dixon was looking for.
[143:43.65]They both were shooting at me.
[143:44.45]I just got sandwiched by both.
[143:45.39]So we're fine.
[143:45.73]We're taken care of.
[143:46.89]They took care of it.
[143:47.63]Is this a baseball field right here?
[143:49.53]Oh, wow.
[143:49.87]This is awesome.
[143:50.55]There we go.
[143:51.70]Now this is an open field.
[143:52.62]Perfect.
[144:18.58]I mean, say what you want, but we are taking the most direct route to get there.
[144:23.76]Why is he spawning here?
[144:29.42]Alright, can I make it across this?
[144:37.47]I don't think I can make it across this, right?
[144:39.13]Maybe I... No.
[144:40.45]How deep is this?
[144:41.07]Is this shallow?
[144:41.75]Let's find out how shallow this is.
[144:44.94]If this is just shallow, I can do it.
[144:47.06]It's shallow.
[144:48.06]That's the ground right there, right?
[144:50.14]Yeah, that's shallow, right?
[144:54.56]Yeah, we're good.
[144:57.37]Skipped a lot right there.
[145:01.09]I'm bleeding!
[145:01.67]It's not bleeding, stop lying.
[145:09.77]Get off!
[145:11.31]Get the fuck off.
[145:22.27]Son of a bitch.
[145:26.71]Oh, I'm sorry.
[145:27.43]Was that supposed to hurt?
[145:28.51]You're under arrest.
[145:29.67]Oh, shit.
[145:31.19]What, are they all just drunk in the car?
[145:33.35]Holy fuck.
[145:34.17]I don't understand.
[145:35.48]Motherfucker.
[145:37.44]That's it, punk.
[145:38.24]I'm done playing.
[145:41.62]Don't make me have to subdue you.
[145:46.14]You fucker.
[145:47.48]Don't do that.
[145:48.14]I'm going to shove my laptop up your ass.
[145:51.40]Ow.
[145:54.32]Get in the car.
[145:56.62]Who's in the car?
[145:57.52]This is just a brawl.
[145:58.28]Get in the car and get the fuck out of here.
[145:59.83]He just punched the door off.
[146:01.31]Everything is so delayed.
[146:04.97]I pressed E like fucking five minutes ago.
[146:24.42]Alright, that's it!
[146:25.89]That's it, that's it.
[146:30.05]Get outta here.
[146:31.55]Fuck off.
[146:37.62]Goodbye.
[146:42.82]I pressed E to get in the car and then like ten seconds later he got in.
[146:49.20]I'm in trouble here, get out of this car.
[146:51.62]I am not fucking around with that thing.
[146:53.58]Are we playing still at time two?
[147:02.53]Hostage, I'll take care of it.
[147:06.03]I'm right here, might as well get it.
[147:07.73]I have an actual zoomed in weapon, you know what I'm saying?
[147:12.35]This should be easy.
[147:15.37]Do I?
[147:15.59]No, I got caltrop.
[147:28.71]I can't really take the shot here.
[147:31.05]Do people level up?
[147:33.57]Alright, well my ghost police officer friend is gone.
[147:39.57]The marker is right here.
[147:43.95]Throw caltrops on him?
[147:45.17]Actually, I want to see what happens if I do that.
[147:46.61]Let's pedestrian caltrop.
[147:48.44]What do you say?
[147:52.78]Oh, that's here.
[147:54.46]Does this hurt people?
[147:55.52]No, this isn't Home Alone, guys.
[147:57.24]This isn't hurting people.
[147:58.50]Well, it does.
[147:59.85]Does it hurt?
[148:01.71]It does hurt.
[148:14.46]They can't go this way.
[148:18.41]No, it doesn't.
[148:20.17]It doesn't really do much, though.
[148:21.71]This lift is shut the fuck up.
[148:26.93]Fuck!
[148:27.11]Fuck!
[148:48.29]I just lost my mate.
[148:49.53]He's a motherfucker.
[148:55.46]Don't sleep with the fishes now.
[148:58.16]What's with all the pimps?
[148:59.58]Goddamn piece of shit.
[149:03.62]This is never-ending carnage.
[149:07.34]Motherfucker.
[149:08.72]Piece of shit.
[149:12.03]Ready to die.
[149:28.61]I don't even have anything to say, you know what I mean?
[149:31.41]I've run out of things to say.
[149:34.35]It's just that, what can you say about this right now?
[149:37.01]We're almost at the mission, it's right over there.
[149:41.33]Don't worry.
[149:42.09]I just wish there were jumps.
[149:58.25]Big.
[149:59.73]Whoa, easy.
[150:00.53]Slow down.
[150:02.17]There we go.
[150:07.93]Game didn't age well.
[150:09.14]I think it aged perfectly well.
[150:10.42]I think it's funny.
[150:12.90]This game's crazy.
[150:17.39]I think it ticks all the boxes for like the weirdo third person open world game.
[150:23.20]Yeah, right.
[150:23.78]Thing is, I'm buying bulk.
[150:25.98]I got a new club opening.
[150:27.46]Can you handle it?
[150:28.52]Damn, nigga.
[150:29.66]We got to see Lincoln about that.
[150:31.22]There's always Lego Island.
[150:33.28]Yeah, that's true.
[150:34.38]He upstairs, yo.
[150:35.74]Let me call him.
[150:36.88]I can't wait to play Lego Island.
[150:38.02]When did I get that movie?
[150:40.12]It'll be a surprise.
[150:43.52]When did I get that movie?
[150:45.72]Apprehend president Lincoln.
[150:47.56]Okay, so this is this is a stealth mission.
[150:53.03]Oh Well don't get seen Everybody can see me here Target this guy I want stealth target this guy
[151:34.03]Well, apparently that's not gonna happen.
[151:37.01]So we're just gonna get up and we're just gonna do it the way that we're supposed to do this.
[151:41.33]Like this.
[151:41.83]My weapon's back.
[151:43.63]That can actually hurt them?
[152:06.57]I want to pick this thing over.
[152:08.41]It so badly wants me to punch this person, but I'm not going to.
[152:12.18]I lost all my weapons.
[152:13.74]It's alright.
[152:16.64]Just get over.
[152:17.52]Get through with this.
[152:23.56]No.
[152:24.28]Too easy.
[152:29.55]Too easy.
[152:30.67]Nah, I'm not going to do something that easy.
[152:35.60]Alright, let's, like, sneak a little bit.
[152:39.90]Never mind.
[152:41.32]Collect evidence.
[152:47.66]They're always talking about their kids.
[152:55.15]Mm-hmm.
[152:57.49]Who's next?
[153:07.78]I wonder if I can put this gun to fire.
[153:10.70]It's possible.
[153:11.68]He might be able to be lit on fire.
[153:16.54]Let's try it.
[153:17.62]It's not that far away.
[153:21.88]Start the process to go this way.
[153:23.42]I think this guy would have woken up by now.
[153:35.21]Okay, I think he's close enough.
[153:40.79]Nope.
[153:45.65]That just angered me that I couldn't light him on fire.
[153:48.15]So.
[153:50.25]You know, you suffer the consequences.
[153:51.39]I have zero clue of what's happening right now.
[154:02.80]So what you can kick.
[154:07.81]Can I- Can I kick this?
[154:08.93]You can only kick the boxes?
[154:11.30]That's kind of annoying.
[154:13.98]You can only- You can't kick the fire over- That sucks.
[154:18.92]Oh well.
[154:21.76]Worth a shot.
[154:25.73]Got a Pluto Jupe.
[154:27.43]Use caltrops on the sleeping people.
[154:29.21]I think they have to be moving for them to work.
[154:37.47]We'll find out.
[154:40.37]Here we go.
[154:42.75]Here we go.
[154:44.73]I got an idea.
[154:49.15]I might be able to do it here.
[154:52.97]Throw it.
[154:55.97]Throw it.
[154:57.25]Why you not throwing it, dude?
[155:01.66]Okay, I don't think I can... No, they're not gonna move.
[155:07.98]What was the point of doing that?
[155:11.54]Oh, whoops.
[155:31.78]I'm shooting the wall, that's fine.
[155:32.96]Are you really just... You're not just gonna stand there and let me do this, are you?
[155:41.11]Why would you let somebody do this?
[155:56.17]What's wrong with me?
[155:59.15]Oh, I'm stepping on the thumbtacks!
[156:01.63]I can't... Oh, wait a minute.
[156:03.11]Can I not... I was gonna say, can I... Can I not complete the mission?
[156:26.62]Get out of here.
[156:30.44]Whoa.
[156:32.01]What's wrong?
[156:32.61]Why do I keep stumbling?
[156:37.41]Disarm him.
[156:38.91]I can do that.
[156:40.17]Here we go.
[156:49.18]Got it.
[156:57.61]Oh, I wanted to unload on him so bad.
[157:02.16]Can I put his head in the blaze?
[157:04.98]Fan joke?
[157:05.40]I wonder if I could... I mean, I could do it, but...
[157:26.08]It's the easiest thing.
[157:26.84]Throwing a dart into the fan is like what everybody wants me to do.
[157:28.93]Right, right.
[157:36.91]I'll look into that.
[157:40.47]You can't even do it.
[157:42.87]No, you can't even do it.
[157:43.87]That's unfortunate.
[157:45.23]Yo, I hope these hurt, motherfucker.
[157:47.95]Arrest him.
[157:49.59]I need money.
[157:52.87]Exit's right here.
[157:54.89]Yeah.
[157:57.91]Wrap around through this room or something?
[157:59.34]Alright, we're good.
[158:06.18]You need to complete this game?
[158:10.58]That's my plan.
[158:11.58]I'm gonna... We're almost done.
[158:12.98]We only have really, like, a one full story mission after this.
[158:17.87]Well, one full story section.
[158:21.07]We are interrogating President Lincoln right now, but I think his gray matter is too fried to
[158:27.40]Yeah, you can throw them into pools of acid in a meat grinder, but not a fan.
[158:31.48]No, I'm not looking to taxi and drive to mission again.
[158:37.27]That's not gonna be good.
[158:38.61]I wanna complete the mission.
[158:39.81]I wanna see the end.
[159:08.68]Let's go.
[159:09.08]Is that called Punisher?
[159:10.92]The Punisher PC game?
[159:12.02]I actually... When did that come out?
[159:13.74]Damn.
[159:13.88]What the fuck happened here?
[159:14.76]Both of them being slaughtered?
[159:16.42]Damn, dawg.
[159:17.58]You alright?
[159:39.94]Oh, I could have told you that was going to happen.
[159:49.39]This place is going to be booby-trapped.
[159:55.38]Someone's going to get up.
[159:57.28]What?
[159:58.04]Okay, never mind.
[159:58.50]They're not going to get up.
[159:59.12]They're just actually going to come after me.
[160:05.99]And you.
[160:13.26]Stupid.
[160:13.96]Give me the better weapon, man.
[160:19.47]Assault rifle's where it's at.
[160:20.71]Bobby traps everywhere.
[160:27.35]Can't make these go off?
[160:31.83]What kind of video game is this?
[160:35.43]Go slowly under lasers.
[160:37.94]My head's gonna touch this.
[160:40.84]Right?
[160:42.38]Is it?
[160:43.10]No.
[160:46.29]Oh, this is going to be a disaster.
[160:48.05]I'm still breathing.
[161:12.10]I didn't think it was possible.
[161:20.30]Why did it happen?
[161:22.48]Don't ask me why it happened there.
[161:23.46]Oh my fucking god.
[161:24.92]Damn it.
[161:25.96]Shit.
[161:29.88]Is there a health pack right here?
[161:30.80]Come on, man.
[161:31.45]How am I supposed to get through this?
[161:34.79]What's the deal here, huh?
[161:37.71]Easy.
[161:38.45]Help.
[161:42.43]That's Hamilton.
[161:46.93]Find out where the other presidents are.
[161:47.89]Give me some info.
[161:48.47]Sting, don't it.
[162:00.52]We're breaking into that safe, too.
[162:01.78]If I was wearing gunner optics, the stream would be way better.
[162:04.46]Well, I am wearing them right now.
[162:05.48]So, the stream is way better.
[162:06.97]Under arrest.
[162:07.51]I'm gonna give you the money and your safe.
[162:29.70]Aw, why is it always fake money?
[162:31.52]Okay, so now what... Do I have to go all the way back there?
[162:41.83]No, right?
[162:45.15]Evidence, okay, um... This is not good.
[162:51.47]Shit, I have to go all the way back, don't I?
[162:57.81]Okay.
[163:04.22]I'm not crazy, right?
[163:06.38]Is there a secret entrance or something?
[163:11.06]Look at chat.
[163:11.98]I am looking at chat.
[163:17.61]What are you doing?
[163:20.27]You alright, man?
[163:25.27]Fuck.
[163:28.64]Behind the desk?
[163:29.94]No.
[163:32.04]Wait, what?
[163:32.40]There's like an elevator behind the guy's desk?
[163:36.02]No, there's nothing here.
[163:38.48]I have to actually... I gotta go through it again.
[163:42.59]I think there'd be a door right here, but there's not.
[163:47.03]Well, let's go back.
[163:51.45]Son of a bitch.
[163:53.13]Don't.
[163:55.24]Seriously.
[163:56.00]I think I can just walk through now.
[163:57.48]No, there's one more here.
[164:19.69]Okay.
[164:28.49]Crisis averted.
[164:34.72]No, I, I, stuff like that, you gotta get, we gotta move on.
[164:40.58]I can't die there.
[164:43.71]Only one or two more presidents.
[164:47.62]He waved at me, trying to just not die.
[164:49.68]Desperately attempting to not die.
[164:51.94]Stop hanging from me.
[164:53.04]How far away is this place?
[164:54.06]I could get there very quickly.
[164:55.34]Where is it?
[164:56.38]Okay, it is up.
[165:17.47]Okay, stop doing that.
[165:18.73]Please.
[165:20.13]Oh, God.
[165:21.05]Give me the fucking map.
[165:26.00]So I need to go down here.
[165:28.38]So I can go and... No, I'm not doing the subways.
[165:30.04]I'll be crashed again.
[165:31.42]Never mind.
[165:32.10]Forget it.
[165:32.40]Get your shit together, Walken.
[165:51.86]He was in the last game, too.
[165:56.96]He was a different character, though.
[165:58.84]He's playing a new character in this game.
[166:05.80]Is Christopher Walken in Sleeping Dogs?
[166:10.07]I'm going to say no.
[166:12.09]I could be completely wrong.
[166:15.61]Oh, shit!
[166:16.13]Oh, god damn!
[166:19.40]No, he's not.
[166:20.90]Okay.
[166:21.14]Yeah, because then it's changed hands.
[166:24.55]Slipping Dogs was going to be True Crime 3.
[166:27.25]And then they changed studios or something.
[166:29.67]What's the actual story with True Crime 3?
[166:34.83]Why did that happen?
[166:35.65]Why is it not True Crime... Where does it even take place?
[166:44.21]Make him cry home to mama make him cry home to mama Asshole get that cocksucker
[167:06.18]This time, I won't be the one who... Get that cocksucker!
[167:09.76]I... I got him!
[167:10.56]Listen, you jerk!
[167:11.72]I got him!
[167:12.12]Now you can go fuck yourself.
[167:14.04]I actually hit her.
[167:16.64]I am going to rip your balls off.
[167:19.33]Police, not fuckers.
[167:20.85]What the hell?
[167:21.79]Get out.
[167:21.99]This time, I won't be the one who goes down.
[167:25.97]Kill that asshole!
[167:27.21]Asshole!
[167:28.65]That person's a samurai sword!
[167:30.28]I am going to rip your balls off.
[167:32.62]Where'd you get that?
[167:33.32]Get that cocksucker!
[167:38.59]We're on a Christian server, yeah.
[167:41.96]Oh shit!
[167:44.22]They moved the car around.
[167:47.32]I think it was going to explode apparently.
[167:49.46]I did not know that.
[167:50.10]I was not aware.
[167:56.08]A non-swearing stream.
[167:57.76]Oh yeah, didn't I promise that the first five minutes was going to be no swearing?
[168:02.09]I feel like that was true.
[168:10.92]So there's one more mission to do, story-wise, after this is over.
[168:17.46]And then we have completed True Crime New York City.
[168:21.62]And then... Oh, so by the way, we're not like these people here.
[168:25.27]Let's discuss this for a second.
[168:27.63]Saturday is going to be the detective stream.
[168:30.50]So I'm not going to stream tomorrow.
[168:32.28]I want to spend tomorrow making sure that stream is ready to go completely.
[168:37.68]And Saturday afternoon, probably around like 5 Eastern time is when we're going to do the detective stream.
[168:45.74]I want all day tomorrow to make sure it's going to work.
[168:48.46]This is a detective stream.
[168:49.24]That is true.
[168:50.34]But I'm playing as a detective in this one.
[168:52.70]Saturday, you guys are all detectives.
[168:54.92]Oh, shoot out.
[168:56.57]Of course it is.
[169:19.53]It's gonna be another one of these get one of these So far we're okay that fool shoot you I
[169:48.87]Motorcycle's incoming, right?
[169:51.50]Nope.
[169:55.00]I will kill you now!
[169:58.59]I'm killing those fools!
[170:00.93]Oh lord, please!
[170:01.85]Please, please!
[170:04.41]I think it's better to watch your motherfucking face!
[170:12.62]This doesn't make any sense, dude.
[170:14.88]We're going over a jump?
[170:15.98]Okay.
[170:16.24]Did they just copy and paste the same mission?
[170:20.53]There's no- The only difference is I think the limo's a different color.
[170:23.71]What the fuck?
[170:25.15]Hey, I know what that's like, man.
[170:32.14]That sucks.
[170:33.76]Sucks to be you.
[170:41.29]Can this guy please die?
[170:50.80]Oh, this is a pain in the ass.
[171:06.93]Dude, can I shoot the guys right here?
[171:22.00]Okay, I'm gonna lose this one.
[171:30.82]Those guys in the trunk need to go!
[171:34.99]I can't even aim up there.
[171:37.57]They're blocked by imaginary walls.
[171:41.25]Okay, reload.
[171:45.79]Full ammo.
[171:47.47]And we'll be done.
[171:56.41]He has Molotov?
[171:59.67]Alright, it's Molotov.
[172:08.10]Okay.
[172:15.04]Lord.
[172:15.76]Come on.
[172:22.43]Just the bike is following me.
[172:31.75]Grenade launcher.
[172:36.49]Come on, use the fucking grenade launcher, stupid!
[172:46.64]The car is about to die.
[172:47.90]Just please have this be the end.
[172:52.54]I don't want to do this whole thing again.
[173:02.03]I can't aim.
[173:10.25]I can't.
[173:13.28]I couldn't move the mouse up.
[173:20.02]Literally could not move the mouse.
[173:22.96]Also, keep in mind, I cannot use any other weapons.
[173:28.07]I have to use this thing.
[173:31.33]I cannot switch weapons.
[173:33.52]We only get to hold the mouse button down on cars.
[173:37.16]Oh, for the love of God.
[173:46.31]No other weapons.
[173:51.83]Where is this guy?
[174:04.99]I wish I could be driving this car
[174:34.16]Stop snapping me.
[174:38.50]Oh my god.
[174:39.86]I hate how it snaps me.
[174:41.86]I feel like I'm editing a video right now.
[174:43.89]I feel like I'm dragging something around in Photoshop with snapping enabled.
[175:05.98]I have nothing to say.
[175:07.59]I can't... Please let me just... I wish I could jump out of this car.
[175:41.55]No, I don't want to fight you anymore.
[175:44.27]I can't shoot the guy in the driver's seat.
[175:47.48]I just did somehow.
[175:48.60]He exploded out of the car.
[175:51.20]Thank god they're idiots.
[175:54.27]Oh my god, that just saved my life.
[175:55.77]I'm so happy about that.
[176:11.54]deal with here just an extra damage it's just a groundhog day
[176:46.74]I don't know if I'm gonna make it again.
[176:59.71]I'll triple A. I want to hire a second person to help me play the game.
[177:03.80]This is the guy that killed me last time.
[177:15.19]Die!
[177:16.55]Die!
[177:17.27]Move the mouse up, please!
[177:20.19]You fucking bastard.
[177:21.59]Move the mouse up!
[177:24.36]Oh!
[177:26.12]Shoot him!
[177:35.37]Looks like the coast is clear, yo.
[177:37.98]Domo, Mr. Reed.
[177:38.90]Yeah, you owe me, COVID lady.
[177:41.18]Why can't I aim?
[177:42.00]Because the mouse snaps to things in those sequences.
[177:48.51]So my hand, I literally, I could not move the mouse up.
[177:51.65]I will kill him myself.
[177:54.16]Excuse me?
[177:55.08]Who the fuck is Lionel?
[177:56.98]Lionel Jones is Benjamin.
[177:59.38]We're going to do another one of those.
[178:00.45]I'm deleting the game.
[178:01.59]You don't know Lionel Jones?
[178:03.27]The cat with all the music videos?
[178:06.09]Yes, disco god.
[178:08.65]Now big shot hip-hop producer.
[178:11.79]That nigga's low.
[178:12.41]What are you dealing for?
[178:14.29]I met Lionel Jones in Japan in 1998.
[178:17.49]He was broke.
[178:19.50]I needed a distributor in America.
[178:20.90]I'm gonna do one on the ne- there's one in every chapter.
[178:25.10]I'm gonna put it on the podcast.
[178:39.02]Fucking brilliant.
[178:40.44]Next one of those sequences, I'm gonna turn the volume all the way down and we're gonna listen to like a TED talk.
[178:46.50]Slow down, cherry blossom.
[178:50.02]It ain't gonna happen.
[178:51.20]You under arrest.
[178:53.18]So much gratitude.
[179:01.98]I'll deal with you later, lady.
[179:04.59]Now I better get to that factory before they all kill each other.
[179:09.11]Race to the... We gotta go quick.
[179:12.01]I'm gonna go... It's the bike time.
[179:14.33]I mean, I'm on the bike.
[179:22.22]He got right off the bike.
[179:23.44]Oh, should a police officer have been ditching?
[179:30.38]What the hell?
[179:33.48]Okay.
[179:35.02]Right down the center of the road.
[179:37.20]Quickly.
[179:37.76]Hurry up.
[179:45.68]Uh, yeah, the time is counting down.
[179:48.50]Very, very quickly.
[179:50.94]That seems like it shouldn't be going that fast.
[179:54.66]Um, why?
[179:56.66]Um, why is it going that fast?
[180:06.45]It wasn't going that fast before!
[180:09.07]Was it going that fast before?
[180:25.35]I don't know if I can- Jesus Christ, dude!
[180:48.65]This is too fucking quick.
[180:50.76]Oh my god, get me in a car.
[180:52.60]Hurry, I've already lost like 20% of my time.
[180:59.84]What the hell?
[181:07.33]One, two, three, four, five.
[181:09.83]It's double time.
[181:12.01]Give me the bike.
[181:13.33]That was going well until I ran into a school bus.
[181:23.90]This is a faster bike.
[181:25.18]Just don't get driven into it.
[181:26.64]Okay, this way, around the circle.
[181:31.42]You fucking idiot.
[181:38.57]You can stop these on a dime, though.
[181:40.37]That's the good thing.
[181:41.09]I stopped on a dime.
[181:51.39]Only he died.
[182:00.03]Don't... The police cars try to drive into you.
[182:04.97]Alright, we made it.
[182:05.48]We're fine.
[182:09.68]Not quite, though.
[182:10.58]Alright, we're good.
[182:12.42]Goddamn pieces!
[182:14.78]Goddamn pieces!
[182:15.48]Made it.
[182:20.47]Ooh!
[182:21.11]Yeah, yeah, what, bitches?
[182:22.87]You wanna fuck with a president?
[182:24.45]You wanna fuck with Grant?
[182:26.05]Bring it, yeah!
[182:27.35]We knew y'all was coming to us, fuckers!
[182:37.28]They fast forward a lot of things in this game.
[182:40.20]I missed a lot of info.
[182:41.18]How did I get on top of the building?
[182:50.81]Good.
[182:52.27]What do we got for weapons?
[182:57.41]Let's take out a trusty assault rifle.
[183:02.71]Almost done with the presidents.
[183:04.88]Actually, yeah, this one's much better.
[183:06.32]This is the bullpup.
[183:10.70]Bullpup!
[183:17.13]Oh, I think I can scan somebody.
[183:21.41]Yeah, I'll definitely be able to print somebody's face.
[183:25.25]This'll be fun.
[183:29.91]Aww, that was an opportunity.
[183:30.95]They have guns, though.
[183:31.57]It's gonna be hard to get close to someone.
[183:32.99]I might as well just not even fuck around.
[183:45.32]You definitely can drag somebody's face across the ink, though.
[183:50.51]How do I get over there?
[183:55.01]Oh.
[183:57.78]Am I missing something here?
[184:01.08]Did I shoot something?
[184:06.03]Is there a vent or do I have to climb something?
[184:07.65]Oh, there's a ladder.
[184:08.35]Okay.
[184:13.81]Yeah, I mean, why the hell would there be ladders on these things?
[184:16.51]That doesn't make any sense.
[184:17.27]Put ladders on the printers.
[184:30.41]What?
[184:30.95]Oh.
[184:31.31]Alright, let's try it.
[184:32.45]This guy's a fucking idiot.
[184:36.71]Can I do anything with him?
[184:37.35]Can I put his face in something?
[184:41.26]Can I make him run on the treadmill?
[184:44.52]No.
[184:46.80]Apparently not.
[184:56.36]There's a ladder so you can fit more in, so you don't have to weave around.
[185:05.31]That's stupid.
[185:08.47]Plan your office better.
[185:09.95]Somebody, please, just kill that motherfucker!
[185:25.53]Not messing around anymore!
[185:31.15]Grenade launcher?
[185:33.25]Grenade... Was there?
[185:36.84]There was an actual grenade launcher.
[185:39.78]Didn't even see it.
[185:42.94]Am I being baited here, or is there really a grenade launcher down here?
[185:48.33]SMG.
[185:52.77]Uh, bullpup.
[185:57.48]Oh, no.
[185:58.64]You can't shoot grenades.
[186:04.12]There are no grenades.
[186:05.49]You have to throw the grenades.
[186:07.25]There is no noob tube in this game.
[186:10.25]As much as everybody thinks there is and wants to tell me there is, there is.
[186:13.17]It doesn't exist.
[186:21.17]Ah, you punk.

[187:50.02]No interrogation.
[187:50.86]Oh well.
[187:52.52]You can't say I didn't try.
[188:02.68]His head is floating?
[188:05.74]No, it's not.
[188:06.38]His head's floating in the air.
[188:07.92]That's not his head.
[188:35.29]I got a better idea.
[188:42.70]Time wasting?

[196:45.16]I actually cannot go in.
[196:49.92]There's no climbing.
[196:50.70]I actually just have to run all the way around.
[196:53.14]Um, how the fuck am I supposed to do this shit?
[197:00.42]I think I have to sneak by them.
[197:02.32]Yeah, you have to not... Yeah, I'm dead.
[197:07.42]There might be a way I can do this.
[197:08.34]I might be able to grab him.
[197:09.90]Depends on how stupid they are.
[197:18.39]I might be able to dive and grab him.
[197:23.57]Alright, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!
[197:27.96]Get off of him!
[197:36.02]Got it.

[198:33.50]I don't think I can.
[198:37.36]Nope.
[198:41.87]Condenser mic.
[198:43.69]I got one of those.
[198:44.43]It's a beautiful office, I will say.
[199:10.32]That guy died after he died.
[199:11.58]I got choked on whatever he was eating.
[199:32.07]What did I do to him?
[199:34.37]I just unbuckled his seatbelt and it killed him.
[199:39.06]Okay.
[199:44.10]Is he on a piano?
[199:45.64]What are you doing at the piano?
[199:46.82]There's nobody at that piano.
[199:53.34]What are these guys doing?
[199:53.90]That guy just did the scream that I do.
[200:11.51]And his ghost continued to play.
[200:13.30]Alright, how- can I snap everybody's neck?
[200:18.22]Let's see how- let's get a record here, okay?
[200:20.10]Ready?

[200:40.84]He still plays.
[200:41.90]God damn it.
[200:43.98]He's playing the same two chords.
[200:45.92]He's stuck.
[200:46.38]He'll be playing those same three notes for the rest of eternity.
[201:16.19]Alright, where was that?
[201:18.73]Where actually was that?
[201:19.73]I don't even remember.
[201:21.29]I was not paying any attention.

[201:28.24]Oh, okay.

[209:18.32]He's gonna hit the wrong side.
[209:19.02]He's gonna hit the lights and they're gonna blow up in his face.
[209:23.87]There might be health in there.

[211:51.76]There's a health pack behind one of the barrels.
[211:53.42]I think there's one more health pack over here.
[212:00.64]Yeah.
[212:01.22]Full health.
[212:04.58]Ugh.
[212:09.40]Jesus Christ.

[212:12.00]This president is the hardest president.
[212:18.07]I want a new bamboo thing.
[212:20.19]There we go.
[212:21.13]Alright, let's go.
[212:22.14]Fuck you.
[212:30.00]Fuck off.
[212:35.37]Don't let him get a word in edgewise.
[212:38.41]Just take him down.
[212:40.23]Yeah.
[212:42.11]Loser.
[212:46.32]Didn't even get to do a damn thing.
[212:47.92]Good.
[212:48.40]Full health.
[212:50.73]Don't throw the sword.
[212:55.27]Full HP.
[212:57.59]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[213:03.49]I'm ready.
[213:03.77]So stupid.
[213:18.73]Don't go crazy.
[213:23.81]Motile swings.
[213:28.74]Are you serious?
[213:30.52]I'm stuck.
[213:31.02]I can't move.
[213:34.76]I can't fucking move.
[213:38.17]I can't move.
[213:44.49]I'm stuck.
[214:03.04]cash but he makes us change the drop every time the bastard calls himself I was stuck inside of him I couldn't do anything and then I crumpled up into a piece of toilet paper and turned back into a person
[214:22.90]And there it is.
[214:24.04]Here is the final mission.
[214:26.24]Oh, the Mafia.
[214:27.50]La Cosa Nostra.
[214:28.92]Organized crime.
[214:30.02]The Mafia.
[214:30.72]The final of the third mission.
[214:32.24]Whatever you call them, these guys owned New York City for years.
[214:35.75]But then in 1995, this hotshot DA puts away the last dime.
[214:40.69]This game is insane.
[214:41.69]Aldemortician Palermo.
[214:43.99]It was all over the news.
[214:45.28]Hell, there was even a reality show.
[214:48.30]Am I ready for the third limo rail shooter?
[214:50.23]Can't wait.
[214:51.41]It is going to be so much fun.
[214:56.52]We figure there must be a new Don behind all this channeling dirty money into something big, something legitimate.
[215:05.44]Yeah, what was going on with that face?
[215:07.62]But we figured one Gino De Luca.
[215:09.90]That's the picture the guy has?
[215:10.80]Palermo's weakest link, an old school capo who sells fenced goods without kicking up a cut to the new boss.
[215:18.33]In the old days, the Sicilians would cut off his testicles and feed them to a goat for that.
[215:23.83]That, I'm so...
[215:25.29]I'm used to hearing somebody fall off of a building or a high place hearing that scream.
[215:30.87]I thought somebody fell somewhere off in the background.
[215:34.94]I thought in the background of this cutscene somebody fell off of a cliff or something.
[215:41.34]That sound has been so burned into my brain to be something completely different.
[215:46.36]Alright, let's go murder this guy.
[215:49.10]Let's go murder this guy.
[215:53.09]Let's see what kind of shit I can get into.
[215:55.03]Let's go talk to Dad.
[215:56.67]Where's Dad?
[215:57.33]Shit!
[216:00.55]This is going to be near... We're going to get the end of the game here.
[216:02.33]Let's go talk to Dad.
[216:05.51]Informant.
[216:06.09]Is this Dad?
[216:06.47]I don't know what this is.
[216:09.27]What the hell are you doing?
[216:10.41]Oh shit!
[216:11.02]What the hell?
[216:20.03]No, no hostage bullshit.
[216:21.74]Let's go.
[216:22.26]Is Dad blue?
[216:23.04]No, that's a street race.
[216:23.92]Outta my way.
[216:24.32]My dad needs me.
[216:50.28]Sneak through traffic this way.
[216:58.16]Hit every single rail on the way there.
[217:03.08]Why not?
[217:09.24]Oh my god.
[217:10.80]What's happening?
[217:11.34]I'm floating.
[217:12.28]Just hovering in the air.
[217:23.78]Toyota.
[217:25.88]Going places.
[217:33.10]This game is so much fun.
[217:36.02]I love just going up on two wheels.
[217:38.14]Makes me laugh.
[217:48.40]For a second I thought that said Game Over on the bottom of the screen.
[217:50.85]I was like, really?
[217:52.33]Oh.
[217:52.59]Sorry.
[217:52.77]No.
[217:52.87]No.
[217:53.03]Sorry.
[217:54.29]Go and see Dad.
[217:58.09]Hey, Dad.
[217:58.41]I'm here.
[217:58.99]Your son...
[218:16.23]Who's this dad?
[218:17.99]Is that dad?

[219:01.08]Reed.
[219:02.12]Marcus Reed.
[219:03.84]Whiting says you had your ear to the street.
[219:06.12]I could use that.
[219:07.30]Yes.
[219:08.86]Information is a byproduct of my services.
[219:12.42]Lucky for you, I could really use a capable copper on my payroll.
[219:19.26]Precious metals?
[219:19.74]Sure thing.
[219:20.06]Perhaps, if you take care of my needs, I'll make it worth your while.
[219:24.77]Be it information, good old cash,
[219:29.91]Don't show me any boobs, please.
[219:32.02]What do you have in mind?
[219:34.66]Aren't you an eager beaver?
[219:36.98]I like that.
[219:38.76]Well then, how about we start with something simple?
[219:42.58]Hmm, let's see here.
[219:46.04]This one's perfect.
[219:47.42]I have a very common problem, it seems.
[219:49.32]That necklace is just painted on.
[219:50.56]Some poor slug has seen one romantic comedy too many and thinks that one of my girls is his Julia.
[219:55.83]I want you to go and see him before he picks out a tux.
[219:59.25]Persuade him to fall in love with another woman.
[220:02.05]Can I count on you, Mr. Reed?
[220:07.88]That's what I like to see.
[220:11.42]Let's do it.

[220:31.91]Those guys are always walking around with gas cans.
[220:33.60]Trying to drive into me.
[220:38.06]I understand that I'm on the wrong side of the road, but you don't have to drive your car into mine You should drive away from me like that guy just did See how some of you fucking idiots don't turn towards the insane person You turn away from the crazy guy

[222:15.19]Alright, you can't just arrest him.
[222:17.48]I just really wanted to throw him down.
[222:20.46]It was a good camera angle for a guy to get his, like, face thrown down.
[222:28.48]Just grab his sidebar.
[222:32.62]That cop was just like, holy shit.
[222:39.54]We gotta turn the fuck around, man.

[223:41.41]That happened so quickly.
[223:45.81]That happened so fast.
[223:50.91]Wait, I ran over, like, a bunch of people and sidewalked.
[223:54.55]And all of a sudden, the whole police force is willing to do... Oh my goodness.
[224:00.91]I don't even know what to say.
[224:07.81]Just punch the guy's fridge a few times and we'll be done.
[224:13.38]Fuck!

[226:07.42]Not bad.
[226:09.46]Can we go see Dad?

[226:11.40]He's not even on the mini-map, is he?
[226:13.90]Is dad on the mini-map?
[226:16.29]Police booth dojo.

[226:42.69]We'll get to it in a little bit.
[226:49.27]Let's go learn a new fighting style.
[226:50.59]Uh-huh.
[226:57.71]You know, I thought... I don't know where the hell this even was.
[227:04.40]No, we tried to go into a different place and it wasn't open.
[227:06.82]That's $1,000.
[227:12.52]That's not the dojo.
[227:18.74]That's not the dojo.
[227:20.14]That's a bank.
[227:26.99]It's on this side of the street, right?
[227:28.57]There's the dojo.
[227:34.85]What?
[227:35.85]This is not a dojo.
[227:41.14]Pharmacy.
[227:42.24]Dojo.
[227:43.37]Closed.
[227:46.01]Uh, alright, so... What the hell?
[227:51.19]You need to relax.
[227:57.77]Like, just fucking walk.
[227:59.49]What's wrong with you?
[228:00.29]Walk on the sidewalk.
[228:01.37]You're so insane.
[228:07.67]I think she's getting annoyed by the people driving around.
[228:16.38]I guess he'll come back during the day.
[228:18.50]Well, might as well just do another mission.
[228:23.96]She's very mad the dojo is closed.
[228:27.00]What was going on here?
[228:28.10]Oh, pimp.
[228:30.96]Goddammit.
[228:32.52]And he lived.
[228:33.35]Get ready to meet God.
[228:43.19]Under arrest.
[228:44.19]Let's see King.
[228:52.16]You want to do another informant mission?
[228:53.46]Will I get to see Dad again?
[228:54.56]Let's go.
[228:57.28]I'll do one more of these.
[229:04.66]Is nobody ever standing at the taco hut?
[229:06.88]Whatever the hell that is.
[229:09.52]Uninterested.
[229:10.86]Sorry.
[229:11.10]Uninterested.
[229:11.54]Alright.
[229:33.65]Do we got a dad?
[229:34.21]That will be all, Kurt.
[229:35.65]Who?
[229:36.31]I think we found dad.
[229:37.65]Marcus.
[229:39.57]Good to see you, son.
[229:40.53]Nice.
[229:41.63]I'm happy about that.
[229:42.25]I'm here with some bad news, Pop.
[229:44.67]Terry, he's, uh... Yeah, I heard.
[229:48.50]I figured you were gonna make sure your godfather didn't die in vain, right?
[229:52.02]Leads are scarce, Pops.
[229:53.72]So I need some info that only the streets can provide.
[229:55.86]Stopping crime is your... Still got your connects, right?
[229:58.00]Son...
[229:59.73]The king is still running shit, regardless of where his throne happens to be located.
[230:05.69]The dad's a crime boss.
[230:07.45]Well, in return, the king may need his prince to enforce the rule from time to time.
[230:11.76]They allow him to drink in jail.
[230:14.88]Look, I can't keep doing your dirty work.
[230:17.02]We've been through this.
[230:18.48]Son, maybe one day soon I'll get my appeal.
[230:21.92]But until that day comes, I will need your help sometime.
[230:26.04]I got good people out there watching my interest, but your badge and skills are a unique combination.
[230:32.42]I'm not asking you to do it for free.
[230:34.20]If you've got ethical issues with that, think of it as an allowance.
[230:38.50]But please, do not turn your back on your father.
[230:42.60]Fine, whatever.
[230:43.28]I'll do my best.
[230:44.18]I just don't want to have to kill nobody, okay?
[230:47.26]This is nicer than my house.
[230:48.60]Yeah.
[230:50.79]He's got a laptop?
[230:51.77]He's got phones?
[230:52.97]What?
[230:53.29]He doesn't have an internet connection, does he?
[230:56.33]Okay.
[231:20.76]Uh, yeah.
[231:21.72]Anything for you, Dad.
[231:28.14]He just plays Minecraft.
[231:32.72]Locate the fir- Oh god, we gotta do this.
[231:34.89]10 minutes to go collect protection money.
[231:37.27]We did this already, didn't we?
[231:38.21]Yeah, we already did this.
[231:39.01]Let's store the money.
[231:52.06]Might as well put it on, because everyone will get in the way if we don't.
[232:01.96]Anything for dear old dad.
[232:08.36]Hello?
[232:11.64]Uh... What?
[232:13.68]Oh, it's this dude!
[232:14.74]What?
[232:14.92]Is he selling jewelry on the street?
[232:21.87]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[232:25.23]People just driving by, watching me do this to people.
[232:28.75]We're good.
[232:53.71]Why?
[232:55.03]Why did that hurt me?
[233:02.71]Whatever.
[233:06.88]The force knocked him into me and that did more damage to me.
[233:10.26]At least it killed him.
[233:17.84]Three stooges.
[233:20.34]Oh shit!
[233:25.36]You've been ducking the king.
[233:26.86]Make this.
[233:27.36]Yo, you better produce that cake.
[233:28.80]What do you know?
[233:30.02]I don't want to.
[233:32.42]This is really funny.
[233:33.50]I need more time.
[233:34.74]This is a Twitch view.
[233:35.50]Okay.
[233:36.06]Here's what I pay him for.
[233:39.62]That's all of it.
[233:40.65]That's more like it.
[233:54.57]Get out!
[233:56.49]No message around.
[234:02.13]Step on it.

[235:01.95]Stop!
[235:04.69]Oh my fucking god.
[235:10.12]What am I supposed to do about this guy?
[235:17.26]Interrogate.
[235:21.85]Oh my fucking god.
[235:22.77]I'm gonna lose.
[235:23.97]I can't- I can't interrogate him.
[235:34.44]He just- Okay.
[235:36.96]Oh!
[235:37.16]It's back!
[235:37.36]It's back!

[235:46.68]Pop, look, I- I- What happened to the markers I used to know?
[235:51.38]I don't care about it.
[235:52.50]Whatever.
[235:53.22]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[235:56.95]So what happened there?
[235:58.25]Because I... I walked up and... He got mad that I walked up and grabbed him or something?
[236:03.39]Like, what was that about?
[236:06.23]How did I... What happened?
[236:08.80]Sorry, dog.
[236:19.25]He got run over by a car.
[236:20.25]Well, I know, but before that, though, I usually could just walk up and grab him.
[236:23.65]It's because I tackled him?
[236:26.99]No.
[236:30.14]Now, how's that not making him... Sending a message, you know?
[236:41.06]Sneak around here.
[236:42.04]Alright, let's stake out the restaurant.

[242:03.67]I can keep going.
[242:05.95]No, he's going to the fridge.
[242:08.15]Don't worry, he's going right into there.
[242:10.50]Don't make me the bad guy.
[242:23.12]I got two words.
[242:26.48]Witness protection.
[242:28.34]Cause the new Donna lab may whack for this.
[242:31.12]Hey look, you wanna stop without me?
[242:33.18]He takes orders directly from the top.
[242:35.39]He runs Palermo's old mortuary, the Burley Gates, to Washington Heights.
[242:43.89]Singin' like a canary.
[242:45.77]Thanks.
[242:54.33]I can't put him in the freezer.
[242:56.63]Unfortunately.
[243:01.05]Anything else in here?
[243:01.83]Alright, we're good.
[243:08.44]Part two.
[243:14.10]Pizza him.
[243:17.00]You could have.
[243:17.74]I tried to.
[243:18.24]I didn't do it.
[243:20.33]is just knock out and then arrest.
[243:22.77]Hello?
[243:23.31]Detective, we had Chino DeLuca picked up.
[243:26.37]Not literally, of course, because he is huge.
[243:28.77]Motherfuck.
[243:29.21]Yes, good coming.
[243:30.47]I thought I could only knock him out.
[243:33.60]Jesus.
[243:34.16]Everything was great.
[243:36.14]Cassie, let me guess.
[243:37.74]You need something, right?
[243:39.10]Showed up and you were about to push him.
[243:40.38]Detective, you must be psychic.
[243:42.74]No, but I can tell I'm probably not going to like this.
[243:45.97]Why don't you come over here and find out for yourself?
[243:47.55]I don't even hit the cards either.
[243:49.40]Let's see what, uh... Let's see what he knows.
[243:59.13]Who's next on the list?
[244:01.89]Missed the freezer joke?
[244:02.85]Well, there'll be more environmental murders, don't worry.
[244:08.57]We probably have like another hour in the game.
[244:10.05]There's at least three or four more murder opportunities.
[244:12.97]Yes, I'm on the wrong side of the road, I understand.
[244:15.87]Yo, next time take the subway!
[244:19.79]No, forget about the unstable man.
[244:25.28]Forget about the unstable man in the bus.
[244:54.24]That's why I tried to turn to get on the right side of the road.
[244:56.94]And I'm on the wrong side of the road.
[244:59.68]Visual contact with suspect!
[245:01.18]Freeze!
[245:01.48]Just looking at chat.
[245:07.06]Sorry.
[245:10.98]Sorry.
[245:11.80]Forget about the rock band.
[245:16.57]I want to keep the story going.
[245:17.71]I like the story.
[245:24.08]I like the grab guy from behind and hit him in the head five times for him to get three exclamation points to tell you the story.
[245:34.35]Reading, chat, and driving.
[245:36.83]Yeah.
[245:37.73]I pretty much am.
[245:41.15]Scream and drive.
[245:41.79]Is it in this game?
[245:51.63]Alright, what is the over-under that this gas station will explode?
[245:59.08]A lot of them don't.
[245:59.82]You know what I'm saying?
[246:02.72]Lots of them do not when you crash into them.
[246:06.68]Let's find out.
[246:07.82]I'm actually just curious.
[246:13.06]It's not sensitive.
[246:13.96]Okay.
[246:25.91]Well, it does.
[246:26.35]It can.
[246:29.19]Interesting.
[246:30.01]We good.
[246:48.76]No damage, yeah.
[246:49.58]I just jumped a bunch of times.
[246:50.60]Resolved.
[246:50.78]So isn't this a one-to-one Times Square?
[246:52.22]Isn't this like the big selling point of the game?
[246:54.43]It's how it is actually Times Square.
[246:56.61]For the first time ever or something.
[246:57.87]Hell yeah!
[247:15.40]Get a full time square.
[247:19.63]Do the two wheel into the subway.
[247:25.49]Next chance I get, promise it'll happen.
[247:28.45]Except I want a nicer car.
[247:32.01]For instance, this thing.
[247:33.98]It's a little nicer.
[247:35.92]This thing's a little nicer, right?
[247:39.40]It's like a muscle car.
[247:40.14]Yeah, this is good.
[247:45.03]It is a subway.
[247:45.57]Let's try it.
[247:48.06]This might not work.
[247:48.96]I would take a loading screen.
[247:50.32]We'll try it though.
[247:51.74]This ain't going to fit down there.
[247:53.14]Maybe with a bike.
[248:12.34]What the hell?
[248:13.63]What the hell is going on?
[248:14.55]This is not going to happen.
[248:22.21]Get out of the fucking way.
[248:23.59]I'm going to lose my license.
[248:30.48]No, it's not going to happen.
[248:31.52]I need a bike.
[248:32.74]I'll drive with a bike.
[248:35.02]Yeah, bowling.
[248:37.16]Yeah.
[248:45.05]What is my alignment right now?
[248:47.25]Let's take a look.
[248:50.39]We got, uh, status.
[248:54.81]We have street races, major cases, game completion, major cases, and we're almost done with the game.
[249:03.17]Career.
[249:04.11]Rank bad cop points, good cop points.
[249:08.29]I'm actually not doing that bad.
[249:11.85]I've done a lot of good things.
[249:23.99]There's a floating pixel on the Earth.
[249:25.83]Do I have to reupload it?
[249:32.12]Try to keep it there.
[249:51.19]There's not very much control that I had here.
[249:59.93]It's a satellite, you'll see it.
[250:06.20]Oh, an accident!
[250:07.26]Aaaaah!
[250:19.23]Well, you're under arrest.
[250:30.19]Oh my God, really?
[250:34.82]Good God.
[250:36.82]Thanks for the bike.
[250:41.62]Appreciate it.
[250:46.19]Taxi driver was just insane.
[250:52.84]What's going on over here?
[250:55.44]That bus was just plowing through people.
[250:58.82]He did not fit there.
[250:59.88]I crashed, but that's not because I didn't see it.
[251:25.10]Right in the middle.
[251:28.96]It's the easiest way to do it.
[251:33.91]Just follow the yellow lines and you'll be safe.
[251:44.17]Especially if you've got a bike that's tires are as wide as the center.
[251:49.61]It's almost impossible for you to get in the car, actually.
[251:55.73]I'm not going to advise or condone that somebody do something like this when they're in a car.
[251:58.83]That would be very bad, very illegal.
[252:00.41]Don't do that.
[252:01.91]But it's just the perfect amount of width for your bike.
[252:08.61]I'm riding your bike here.
[252:16.98]Excuse me.
[252:24.01]That guy, did you see that guy?
[252:24.77]That guy's nuts.
[252:26.60]He's been whipped around the corner.
[252:34.84]Just don't get T-boned by somebody.
[252:38.13]This is gonna be tricky.
[252:40.99]Mm-hmm.
[252:45.35]But done with precision.
[253:00.56]It's far away, and I just can't take the subway.
[253:02.38]I'm afraid to do any of the things that require loading screens.
[253:04.97]There's a central dispatch called 10-50.
[253:05.69]Reports received of active arson is in vicinity.
[253:06.81]Setting fire to surrounding property.
[253:13.99]Oh, oh wait, is this place?
[253:14.65]This is a trick.
[253:23.28]It makes me get to see New York.
[253:25.98]And all the gray, brown, and beige buildings.
[253:32.82]This is a nightclub?
[253:34.12]This is really really lame nightclub.
[253:37.14]This is a dive bar.
[253:38.34]Somebody here has drugs, okay.
[254:00.75]What the hell you doing?
[254:01.59]Oh.
[254:03.81]It's just sitting on the table.
[254:10.24]Oh.
[254:10.80]It... They don't really care about hiding it, I guess.
[254:14.16]Watch where you going, moron!
[254:18.75]Is there more?
[254:29.42]No, it's just on the table.
[254:35.54]What the hell is this establishment?
[254:37.84]You guys are just doing drugs off the table when a police officer walks in.
[254:42.08]Okay, he's at three pieces of evidence collected.
[254:45.30]Resolved.
[254:46.90]There's one right there, though.
[254:52.03]Get the fuck out of the way.
[254:53.93]He wants that.
[254:54.47]Got it.
[254:54.97]Okay.
[254:59.32]Alright, 404.
[255:03.12]Thank you.
[255:05.42]You want to get punched in the face?
[255:06.60]I need to get the camera out.
[255:24.23]kick just because I'm a woman don't mean I won't fuck you up what was the what was the game or the video where I just kicked somebody directly in the face from behind they were sitting on a porch and I just booted them directly in their face that was one of the funniest things I've ever seen no don't do this mafia 3 that's what it was
[255:49.69]Does that clip still exist?
[255:51.45]That was fucking hysterical.
[255:53.37]Somebody get it.
[255:54.51]Do clips last forever?
[255:57.91]Hey, you wanna get punched in the face, man?
[256:00.53]It's on the second channel.
[256:19.06]Yeah, that's true.
[256:25.74]Blaidd.
[256:26.60]Blaidd's just easier to drive than all these guys.
[256:33.60]Please take Blaidd.
[256:39.51]And off we go.
[256:43.63]I believe we are there.
[256:44.87]Or at least almost there.
[256:48.16]Wrap around this way.
[256:50.88]Don't fucking come on.
[256:52.92]And I'm dead.
[256:53.28]Of course I am.
[256:55.18]To all people.
[256:56.32]Don't forget it's only one.
[256:57.50]Fighting over a tip.
[257:04.67]That's awesome.
[257:16.93]How would you fight over a tip as a waiter?
[257:19.45]If you had a table, and you were waiting on that table.
[257:22.11]Like, alright, so there's like a couple comes in, and I'm assigned that table as a waiter.
[257:27.09]And they tip me money.
[257:28.67]Why would another waiter come over and say, Hey, that's my tip!
[257:33.03]Isn't that how it works?
[257:36.33]Why would you fight over a tip?
[257:38.11]Whose table was it assigned?
[257:48.46]No, that's the snort clip.
[257:49.60]That's not the clip I'm talking about.
[257:56.61]Somebody linked the clip above the snort one.
[257:58.47]Let me look.
[258:01.69]Ah, there it is.
[258:02.15]Okay.
[258:02.61]Let's see.
[258:03.55]That I'm doing in this game.
[258:04.61]All these little mini games and mini missions.
[258:10.31]Let's see.
[258:16.24]That's so fucking heinous.
[258:20.03]Just a total cheap shot.
[258:22.49]Kicking in the face from behind.
[258:24.57]That's not cool.
[258:26.61]Nothing about that is cool.
[258:28.25]Bike in the subway.
[258:29.75]After this mission.
[258:34.83]We'll get in there after this mission.
[258:40.37]Okay, I see it.
[258:44.42]I guess I could just walk in the door.
[258:50.50]Am I putting teeth?
[258:51.48]What the hell?
[258:52.27]Is this guy a clown?
[258:54.73]Why is that guy wearing a clown flower?
[258:57.21]I don't know.
[259:24.59]Well, locate the lab.
[259:26.85]Well, there's a guy that I don't know up here, so we're gonna have to just blow through, apparently.
[259:34.23]Assault rifle.
[259:36.71]Let's just go through.
[259:37.69]Shouldn't be too big of a deal.
[259:40.54]Okay.
[259:41.02]Goodbye.
[259:54.82]What about your two lackeys?
[260:01.74]I didn't do that.
[260:02.36]The game just held the trigger down.
[260:06.93]What do you got here?
[260:09.39]What are these?
[260:09.77]Oh.
[260:12.99]This is a candle.
[260:15.49]Forget about the candle.
[260:16.31]I got a sledgehammer.
[260:19.29]No.
[260:19.77]I always use the assault rifle.
[260:20.85]There's no reason not to.
[260:22.29]This is the best weapon in the game.
[260:28.98]He's fucking shooting me.
[260:36.35]Is it seriously this guy?
[260:37.67]Well, I just got annihilated.
[260:46.64]Is there health around here?
[260:59.62]Fuck.
[261:06.09]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[261:11.57]You kiss my ass.
[261:14.21]Fatti avanti, stronzo.
[261:22.44]Ah, stronzo.
[261:29.20]There's a couple guys.
[261:29.88]There's one guy over there.
[261:30.76]No.
[261:32.94]Gonna just run up there.
[261:46.76]And you.
[261:49.66]Good.
[261:50.50]Give me the health.
[261:51.84]And it's time to move on.
[261:57.93]I gotta sneak through and shoot them through the walls.
[262:04.80]All this shit that's in the way.
[262:13.32]Okay.
[262:15.20]Same thing with this dude.
[262:18.64]Another guy behind this left side.
[262:21.43]Guy down there!
[262:22.09]Behind the boxes!
[262:24.43]Behind the back!
[262:42.66]Is that it?
[262:44.54]Smells like it.
[262:45.16]Uh, extra ammo.
[262:58.51]Full auto shotgun.
[262:59.71]Don't mind if I do.
[263:00.49]This thing sucks.
[263:04.65]I could probably cremate somebody.
[263:06.93]Oh, that's not cool.
[263:08.63]I really thought I could.
[263:09.65]Maybe I can.
[263:10.81]Doctor's working on patients.
[263:12.93]I need a different weapon than the caltrop Hold on a second, let me change items first
[263:39.34]Oh boy, the mouse makes me want to throw up sometimes.
[263:52.99]Did not expect that.
[263:55.37]Did I do anything with the guy's teeth?
[263:56.55]Oh, I probably could have killed him.
[264:06.30]I probably could have just walked around the corner and shot him a bunch of times.
[264:11.48]Evidence.
[264:14.24]One of seven.
[264:15.46]Not doing so well on that.
[264:19.80]You can sing in the chat.
[264:25.65]That is getting late.
[264:26.61]Where the fuck is this guy?
[264:28.59]Hey!
[264:28.71]Come back here, motherfucker!
[264:30.09]This one off my balls, you fucking prick!
[264:35.03]I like Lynyrd Skynyrd.
[264:35.81]They're the guys that did the Sweet Home Alabama, right?
[264:44.03]That one song, I heard it before.
[264:47.54]I've heard that song by Lynyrd Skynyrd before.
[264:55.90]What am I supposed to do?
[264:58.87]Am I supposed to shoot him?
[265:00.17]Am I supposed to pull him out?
[265:01.03]Block him off?
[265:03.09]If you move, I'ma fuck you up!
[265:08.28]I guess.
[265:10.97]Don't shoot him in the head.
[265:12.41]No, just to grab him, I think.
[265:18.01]Because I'm going to accidentally shoot him in the head.
[265:29.72]Am I going to even be able to interrogate him?
[265:31.52]Can I say that word, please?
[265:36.46]I don't know what to do about this.
[265:37.46]Should I just jump on him?
[265:43.44]He's really fast.
[265:44.26]I'm just scared to, like, tackle him.
[265:46.91]Come on, dude.
[265:50.49]There we go.
[265:51.17]Okay.
[265:51.33]Get up.
[266:13.55]Um... Okay, I don't think I can interrogate him.
[266:18.92]Um... Yeah.
[266:25.30]This one's making sure.
[266:30.47]Is this the proper bank right here?
[266:44.43]Wrong way.
[266:44.91]Bring it down.
[266:45.93]Cool it down.
[266:46.49]There you go.
[267:07.35]Interrogation in the middle of the street.
[267:12.59]Somebody's shooting a gun somewhere, though.
[267:14.73]I wonder what's going on over there.
[267:19.41]That seems really intense.
[267:21.35]You're under arrest.
[267:22.59]I got a feeling we're pretty much at the end of the game.
[267:38.99]I'm going to say one or two more missions and we're going to be near.
[267:41.67]You're going to finish the game tonight.
[267:44.37]He already said that.
[267:45.57]No, I don't want to do another one of your dumb missions.
[268:08.71]Finish all races or unfollow.
[268:12.41]No, I don't want to do even one race.
[268:16.88]That does not sound like something I would like to do.
[268:18.34]Yeah, whatever happened to the ghost piano?
[268:27.28]I wish it was still going.
[268:30.56]Give us something to listen to.
[268:31.40]Because all the copyright music had to be turned off.
[268:34.50]So the VOD screen would get muted.
[268:38.82]No, that is in fact not an impression of Christopher Walken.
[268:41.19]That's a real Christopher Walken.
[268:45.63]How far away is this one?
[268:48.93]Jesus.
[268:49.77]Jesus Christ.
[268:50.95]Okay.
[268:52.14]The game just saved.
[268:53.16]I'm going to roll the dice here.
[268:54.80]I'm going to get in a cab.
[268:56.54]This is like a 20 minute drive.
[268:58.06]Alright, wish me luck.
[269:15.65]Vincent.
[269:16.31]Detective Reed, I think this belongs to you.
[269:20.31]A little souvenir I picked up from the pearly gates.
[269:22.91]That's one of your spots, right?
[269:25.83]True, I am on the board of the old mortuary, but I haven't set foot in there, ever.
[269:31.54]In fact, I've been trying to sell it.
[269:33.54]It doesn't really fit my, uh, family business.
[269:37.86]I prefer real estate sure the family business don't involve murder don't I have that important meeting hey how about payouts to cops you're in way over your head good day detective how about a workout Mr. police charges 500 an hour but this session's on me
[269:58.78]I see a blinking weight over there.
[270:01.98]I feel like I'm gonna cheat here.
[270:06.52]Don't make me knock you out, girl.
[270:09.40]I'm gonna give you a... I cheated.
[270:11.30]Oh, I'm sorry.
[270:12.06]What is that supposed to hurt?

[285:17.61]True Crime Sponsored Stream.
[285:20.14]Now, wouldn't that be hilarious?
[285:23.14]Considering they don't sell this game anymore.
[285:27.40]Imagine this was a sponsored stream for True Crime New York.
[285:33.46]I think there are only like five copies of this game in circulation on Amazon.
[285:39.66]What a waste of money that would be.
[285:41.50]Hey, what's up?
[285:47.85]We're gonna be behind a taxi cab.
[285:49.99]Fastest way to travel.
[285:52.23]Is that a baby?

[286:18.62]Shit!
[286:20.13]You're fucking relentless, aren't you?
[286:23.07]Sponsored by one of the five copy holders to make it so they can charge $1,000 for one copy to people like it's rare.
[286:31.08]Then they pay enough cash to make sure fucks like you stayed out of my business.
[286:33.76]Who did you pay?
[286:35.96]Yo, freeze!
[286:39.66]Wow.

[286:50.06]He already broke the glass.
[286:51.18]Go in.
[286:51.58]It's an open door.
[286:52.72]I see explosives.
[286:53.92]I see gas tanks.
[286:56.36]Gas tank.

[287:56.67]Not so much.
[287:57.11]Is somebody going to try to run me over with a car?
[288:02.05]That's either a car or a lawnmower.
[288:09.83]What happened to the gun?
[288:10.55]Alright, legs.
[288:15.38]His legs are going to come off.
[288:21.87]Only one leg.

[290:56.66]Guess I could arrest some of these guys.
[290:59.31]Did I have to drop the gun, though?
[291:03.65]That's stupid.
[291:04.51]I had to drop the gun.
[291:07.19]Health pack.
[291:09.05]All three of you die instantly.
[291:11.01]Check it out.

[291:42.80]Yeah.
[291:43.74]Shit, I could've get that extra health, but I didn't.
[291:52.74]Not here.
[291:54.38]This guy's not gonna turn into, like, a mutant or something, is he?
[291:57.58]This is get to the top of the tower and the bad guy turns into you.
[292:01.10]That's every one of these games.
[292:05.90]You know, he stands there and he starts walking forward slowly.
[292:08.46]He has a monologue.
[292:11.94]I'm glad you could finally make it.
[292:13.56]And like tentacles and limbs are coming out of his neck and head and shit.
[292:17.02]And then boom!
[292:21.16]He turns into the nemesis.
[292:30.37]This is actually... not good.
[292:34.69]I don't have any- THERE'S NO BULLETS IN THAT GUN!
[292:42.08]DIE!

[292:52.80]Oh my god, no!
[292:54.12]No!
[293:01.36]Why do I have to do this shit from the very beginning?
[293:03.90]It's so tedious.
[293:04.92]By the way, I'm not doing this.
[293:11.89]It's doing it for me.
[293:29.83]He's shooting the gun for me.
[293:33.36]Give me your gun.
[293:39.92]Give it to me.
[293:41.12]I'm so sick of this.
[293:42.00]Fuck.
[293:42.22]He's shooting the gun for me.
[293:51.02]Stop firing the gun.
[293:52.40]Oh boy.
[293:58.64]I'm having trouble running around, actually.
[294:04.04]Speedy, speedy.
[294:11.86]Ah, that's what I'm talking about.
[294:13.32]Don't.
[294:14.18]Please.
[294:15.22]Don't just start firing the gun.
[294:30.94]Stupid motherfucker.
[294:32.64]It is stupid.
[294:39.52]That's it, punk.
[294:40.30]I'm done playing.
[294:41.24]That's it, punk.
[294:41.96]Yeah.
[294:42.40]Let me get my caltraps out to throw at you.
[294:45.94]Get that mother.
[294:49.30]Fucking caltraps.
[294:50.26]The stupid things that I just threw over there.
[294:52.01]I'm fucking everything up.
[294:52.91]Over there.
[294:53.43]Hurry up.
[295:01.94]Get that mother... Nah, I want the... There we go.
[295:11.45]That's a good one.
[295:12.07]Forget about arresting.
[295:12.79]I don't care.
[295:13.15]I just want to get back to where I was.
[295:16.91]And this time, just not... What if you run out of ammo?
[295:22.27]You know what I'm saying?
[295:22.98]Like, shit.
[295:39.02]SMG.
[295:41.92]Slow down time.
[295:42.68]I would love to do that, actually.
[295:47.84]Double tap space.
[295:48.92]What a brilliant idea.
[296:01.40]That's brilliant.
[296:02.54]Thank you, the person in the chat that had the absolutely brilliant idea to pick up a bunch of items and put them on the elevator.
[296:12.13]You get a gold star, man.
[296:14.61]This is going right in here.
[296:15.51]I'm just going to drop them on here.
[296:21.13]Perfect.
[296:28.00]Stick them all up there.
[296:33.36]What am I going to use first?
[296:39.02]Nice work.
[296:40.00]There's like two more here.
[296:40.85]I'm going to lean it up over there.
[296:43.23]That should be alright.
[296:44.01]I was almost at the top.
[296:46.39]Of course it disappears.
[296:47.31]Don't!
[296:52.65]Good thing that didn't explode.
[296:55.05]That would have been a disaster.
[296:57.76]Reload this gun.
[296:59.24]So what else do I have?
[297:00.04]Do I have... I only have caltrops.
[297:16.45]Well, now I'm royally screwed.
[297:23.70]Okay.
[297:24.26]Well, I'm gonna have to try to do this with only the pistol.
[297:30.97]By the way, just get these fucking things out of here.
[297:33.97]They're a deterrent.
[297:37.47]Sledgehammer, stun baton, nightstick.
[297:39.22]I just have my 38.
[297:40.02]I have to just slow down time and hope I can just hit shots.
[297:47.62]I'm gonna get hit in the head.
[297:49.88]This is so bad.
[297:57.47]This sucks.
[298:07.59]I'm going for the explosive every time.
[298:19.98]I can crouch, but I'm going to get hit in the head.
[298:24.26]If I get hit right in the face, I'm going to die.
[298:27.97]Okay.
[298:42.59]Crosshair, what are you doing?
[298:43.61]This sucks.
[298:46.29]This thing's gonna fall off.
[299:12.13]Why are you snapping?
[299:14.01]Oh my god, I hate this.
[299:26.02]It's just ripping me around.
[299:27.90]We're at the top, right?
[299:29.11]Alright, here we go.
[299:29.95]Okay.
[299:34.45]I got a fully loaded gun.
[299:36.45]I just have to do the slow down, slow motion, and headshot the guy in the crane.
[299:41.95]Right?
[299:42.19]That's absolutely what's going to happen.
[299:44.25]You ain't got nowhere left to go.
[299:47.23]I'm going to knock you into the next life.
[299:52.28]What exactly is happening here?
[299:55.18]I have to play jump rope with this guy?
[300:07.77]I can't get out of the targeting mode.
[300:10.47]Oh boy, oh boy.
[300:11.87]This is just Wipeout on NVC.
[300:27.47]Coming up again, okay good.
[300:30.96]Coming up again.
[300:37.55]This is just wipeout.
[300:39.68]It's too hard.
[300:43.18]Don't stand up.
[300:43.84]Okay, almost done.
[300:55.40]Just focus.
[301:00.12]Excuse me.
[301:01.74]He's just chasing me around now?
[301:10.52]Yeah, he just chases you around and tries to squish you.
[301:13.02]Got it.
[301:14.26]Now go interrogate him and slap him around for a minute.
[301:31.94]El Jefe Bucket set me up.
[301:34.68]I just paid that fucker another drop.
[301:36.80]It was delivered this morning.
[301:37.95]This time to locker 125 at Grand Central Station.
[301:41.69]Your ass better be telling the truth.
[301:43.53]It's gonna be the police chief.
[301:46.75]It's been all along, you know.
[301:59.84]Here we go.
[302:00.32]Let's see how this ends.
[302:02.86]Locate the Grand Central Station.
[302:04.90]Found the mole.
[302:05.59]He's among us.
[302:06.39]Now you stop, so you can take me somewhere instantly, because it's really fun to not have to drive ten minutes.
[302:10.41]That's... I thought that was a dirty cab.
[302:11.97]No, it's just a dirty car.
[302:34.86]Hello.
[302:40.26]Look at how far away this is.
[302:42.85]Let's make it.
[302:44.61]It's going to be a trap, and I'm going to... It might be.
[302:46.93]It's fine.
[302:49.93]The climax of the game.
[302:55.65]They're all gonna turn on me.
[302:56.51]That's just how it works.
[302:57.81]Whitey, what the hell is this?
[303:00.93]Proof's right here, in this locker.
[303:03.27]Yeah, that's my locker.
[303:04.35]So what?
[303:05.15]Chief Navarro, I have a warrant for locker number 125.
[303:08.19]I want you to open it.
[303:09.33]Yeah, all you're gonna see is my clothes and my golf gloves.
[303:11.93]I want you to open it now.
[303:13.66]Alright, God damn it.
[303:15.74]I swear to God, Reed, when this is over, you're gonna wish it would never cross me.
[303:21.24]Are you happy now, huh?
[303:26.67]You were saying, Chief?
[303:29.85]Victor Navarro, you are under arrest for conspiracy, extortion, and the murder of Terrence Higgins.
[303:36.31]You have the right to remain silent.
[303:38.18]That's bullshit.
[303:39.86]It ain't my money.
[303:40.84]I'm being set up.
[303:42.64]What judge in their right mind would buy this?
[303:44.92]My judge, I have the heads of four major crime syndicates whose depositions point to you.
[303:51.45]I think it's time for my cocoa you can't do the speed hey navarro make sure you don't drop the soap I'm not going to jail I'm the goddamn police scary calm down chief just let him go oh well Christopher walken's dead oh god you see what you made me do drop the gun navarro
[304:19.47]Last chase on the subway.
[304:20.69]We could just walk on the subway.
[304:21.67]Ride along the subway.
[304:22.21]Get the control!
[304:22.65]Oh, are you or are you gonna run?
[304:23.57]I think we're gonna do sledgehammer.
[304:46.80]Just snake around.
[304:47.58]This would be terrifying if you were running away from this guy.
[304:51.80]What the fuck is he doing?
[304:52.78]He's freaking me out.
[304:54.84]No, put the gun down.
[304:55.54]I want to...
[305:17.05]Sledgehammer in my hand.
[305:18.25]Okay.
[305:21.07]I can't even see.
[305:44.48]I'm stuck again.
[305:45.38]I'm stuck.
[305:47.28]Why am I facing this way?
[305:49.70]Is he charging up something?
[305:51.16]Can I throw him outside?
[305:57.66]Where'd he go?
[305:58.72]Oh.
[306:01.34]I'm stuck again.
[306:04.04]We gotta get to the back and I gotta throw him around.
[306:06.10]This is the shittiest fight.
[306:19.84]Silence.
[306:27.66]I can't, can he get, is he gonna run out of fucking stamina?
[306:30.44]Liquid.
[306:38.17]Snake.
[306:47.59]This time we're in a subway!
[306:49.09]Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna lose.
[306:52.18]The game turns you around and then you visit- Oh, it's such a mess.
[306:56.46]Turn around.
[307:01.24]The game thinks I lost.
[307:02.02]I couldn't even turn the fuck around.
[307:07.69]Oh my god, just fucking shoot him.
[307:16.68]Just get me through here.
[307:24.41]It doesn't matter.
[307:28.25]I'm just gonna put the health back anyways.
[307:35.36]You forced my hand.
[307:46.62]Block.
[307:47.92]There's health back there.
[308:14.99]Don't you say it's a microwave subway?
[308:17.61]Why?
[308:22.60]Give me the health.
[308:33.29]Back to the back of the train.
[308:34.19]Come on.
[308:35.03]I gotta move him back here so I can push him out, right?
[309:07.10]Is there an ending?
[309:08.80]He doesn't have a health bar.
[309:10.80]I really think I have to just push him back.
[309:20.19]This is getting real confusing.
[309:27.78]I'm running out of stamina.
[309:31.02]I gotta push him off the train, but I have to get him to the back of the train first.
[309:36.71]No, don't spin him.
[309:37.49]Okay.
[309:38.47]Come this way.
[309:42.93]Come on.
[309:45.35]New York fucking police.
[309:47.41]Police.
[309:48.17]And I'll fuck you up.
[309:51.00]One time, asshole.
[309:54.06]New York fucking police.
[309:56.06]Police.
[309:56.48]Ah!
[309:57.22]Oh my god, this is terrible.
[310:01.22]Fuck!
[310:05.16]Oh my god, I just inhaled all those bullets.
[310:06.98]I'm gonna lose right now.
[310:09.04]Oh my fucking lord.
[310:48.29]fucking rhyme or reason to this.
[310:50.49]At all.
[310:50.81]Okay, here we go.
[310:54.59]He's in the back.
[310:56.73]No, he's not.
[310:58.25]No, he just spins him around.
[311:03.24]Jesus Christ almighty.
[311:18.45]Half my inputs aren't even being registered.
[311:22.39]This is fucking stupid.
[311:29.02]Wait, this is just such a sloppy fucking end to this game.
[311:34.80]What is this game?
[311:35.96]Oh!
[311:49.95]I didn't learn anything in the dojo.
[311:51.41]You see how many people's asses I've kicked regardless?
[311:54.75]We fought five bosses in this game.
[311:56.74]I didn't even need to do that.
[311:59.98]You've caused enough problems for me, Reed.
[312:04.16]You kissed my ass.
[312:06.28]You forced my hand.
[312:08.65]Fuck, what was that?
[312:10.65]And why am I losing all this other stuff?
[312:12.15]Stay where you are, Reed.
[312:18.01]I need to play a different mini-game.
[312:19.67]Now I'm gonna give this one last attempt here.
[312:45.09]Rage is at Street Fighter V ranked.
[312:50.72]Stop letting him push you back.
[312:51.74]I don't think you understand how not possible this is right now.
[312:55.81]We're on one plane.
[313:09.29]This is like... Nothing makes sense with this.
[313:11.61]I want to give you control of the game.
[313:13.23]I want to give you guys all control of the game right now.
[313:15.33]And have you throw up in your hands.
[313:16.95]Oh my god, please turn around.
[313:44.93]I've never seen a grand finals like this in my life.
[313:50.80]You know what?
[313:51.27]How about we just do this?
[314:08.23]You have to get him to the end of the train.
[314:10.05]That's like easier said than done.
[314:12.33]It's almost an impossible melody.
[314:13.87]It's like, it just keeps fucking turning.
[314:20.30]My god, this is the worst thing ever.
[314:24.08]Oh, it's the- What's the cheat to fucking get double damage with this putrid end of this game?
[314:32.54]I'm just gonna cheat.
[314:33.78]Because this is fucking unbearable.
[314:37.44]Shit.
[314:42.17]This is the best thing.
[314:43.77]This is not the best thing.
[314:45.51]This is the fucking worst thing ever.
[314:47.37]Oh yeah, you were set up.
[314:52.73]It's so sad.
[314:53.73]It's such an awful thing.
[314:56.99]The problem is, these guys are already dead.
[315:00.77]Alright, get to the back of the train.
[315:03.44]I'm doing it for real.
[315:29.00]Cheat to beat.
[315:30.38]It's kind of dire at the moment, man.
[315:33.29]Okay, his punches pushed me back so far, but mine don't at all.
[315:36.81]And then sometimes, we go through each other, and then that happens.
[315:44.37]There is no leveling up your character in this game.
[315:46.87]There's no, like, stat points.
[315:51.89]Ah, much better.
[316:03.94]Oh my fucking god, why do you have to have me go throw him?
[316:14.17]I'm trying not to do the ha- Oh, this is the wor- I really seriously cannot unbe- It's unbelievable.
[316:40.87]Fuck in the back of that train.
[316:42.91]What's happening to that guy?
[316:45.80]Get in the back of the train!
[316:49.37]Get in there!
[317:38.78]High punch low punch.
[317:40.90]No, I'm doing that again.
[317:42.90]I'm doing that same fucking strategy again.
[317:44.98]He's just shooting people.
[317:49.12]Oh my fucking god, man.
[317:51.04]Fuck off, dude.
[317:51.64]I can't believe I let Terry talk me into bringing you in.
[318:07.88]Now I'm just gonna spin him around.
[318:47.64]Do it!
[318:48.02]What do I do?
[318:52.84]What have you done?
[318:58.49]No!
[319:07.70]Oh, you fucking stupid game!
[319:17.61]Die!
[319:25.15]She's dead!
[319:35.21]Navarro's been on the force for 30 years.
[319:38.21]I mean, he was an asshole, but this.
[319:41.31]I can't even begin to make sense of it.
[319:43.11]Navarro got what he deserved.
[319:47.05]I'm glad I trusted my gut on this one.
[319:50.23]I bet Terry would be very proud of you.
[319:53.11]Fuck that, man.
[319:53.87]That was so... I hated that.
[319:55.35]Why don't you go home, Marcus?
[319:59.20]Get some rest.
[320:00.00]Why?
[320:00.92]Oh my god.
[320:01.54]I may be a wild tin.
[320:06.84]You knocked him out of the subway, and they put him on a stretcher out of the subway train.
[320:12.86]Was I supposed to do what I just did?
[320:29.07]So what ending did we get?
[320:30.01]It's the bad ending.
[320:32.42]You did good, boy scout.
[320:35.08]I wondered when you'd show up, motherfucker.
[320:38.78]You knew I wasn't dead.
[320:39.66]Navarro told you about his locker.
[320:41.72]I remembered.
[320:42.27]You speak pretty good Spanish, too.
[320:45.83]So I get the money.
[320:46.39]He was always a far guy, wasn't he?
[320:49.07]If you knew Navarro was innocent, why'd you kill him?
[320:52.63]I never liked the motherfucker anyway.
[320:55.13]Yeah, it's a chaotic neutral.
[320:57.75]You fucking played me, Terry!
[320:59.53]You betrayed me!
[321:01.27]Marcus, sorry I had to put you through this, but the feds were on to me.
[321:04.93]I hope we fight on the train again.
[321:05.83]I had to cover up my tracks.
[321:07.03]Can't you see it all worked out beautifully?
[321:08.91]Navarro and Whiting are hanging out with the Maggots, and Dixon's none the wiser.
[321:13.16]Yeah, and I did your dirty work.
[321:16.04]I took down all those gangs.
[321:18.28]Come on, man.
[321:18.88]I couldn't just walk away with the money.
[321:20.64]They'd find me, no matter where I went.
[321:23.46]Thanks to you, we can enjoy the spoils without losing any sleep.
[321:27.16]I probably have to make a choice here.
[321:29.36]South of the border.
[321:30.77]You gotta see it.
[321:31.75]Merry Christmas, kid.
[321:33.29]Take the money or the rest of it.
[321:39.21]Fuck Christmas.
[321:42.91]After all I did for you.
[321:44.51]For your old man.
[321:45.33]I didn't even... Okay, I guess I don't have a say in that.
[321:48.93]He just does it.
[321:50.05]Motherfuckers with no loyalty.
[321:53.38]don't deserve to live.
[322:01.39]That's not even on the guy's head.
[322:02.85]That was added last second in the editing process.
[322:23.32]I'm just sitting... I would run, man.
[322:27.94]Like, you just shot a guy in the head in the subway.
[322:34.27]There's no sense of urgency here.
[322:35.55]Am I talking into them?
[322:46.87]The rules, you see, they bend, they blur, but worst of all, they often break.
[322:50.23]So, I've chosen to live by my own principles.
[322:53.65]I must have missed the train.
[322:55.79]Oh, no.
[322:56.31]The next one comes in 15 minutes.
[322:57.33]There are but three things that matter.
[322:59.27]Family, loyalty, and respect.
[323:04.04]Marcus may have despised a great many things about me, but I always knew that he is his father's son.
[323:11.68]So, I'm that guy.
[323:12.70]And I can also see that there's more to him than that.
[323:16.70]Alright.
[323:28.09]That was true crime.
[323:30.43]New York City.
[323:35.88]But we're not quite done because I want to get a bike into the subway.
[323:41.00]Hey!
[323:46.02]Get the fuck out of my way.
[323:47.86]The game's over now, so that means I can do whatever the fuck I want.
[323:50.18]Get out of the way.
[323:55.02]I'm not a police officer anymore, right?
[324:01.16]Need a bike.
[324:14.35]You weren't already doing that already.
[324:15.87]Yeah, I guess you could say that's true.
[324:24.18]That hurt.
[324:24.82]Uh, no bike though.
[324:25.78]I thought I... No.
[324:29.66]I ain't a cop anymore.
[324:34.06]I'll kill you!
[324:39.88]One time, asshole.
[324:42.74]Well, that was fucked.
[324:44.59]Sorry.
[324:45.05]What happens if you get like a hundred thousand bad points?
[324:56.89]Now we can see a bike.
[325:05.87]See, they come out of the woodwork and just go nuts.
[325:08.87]Does the military come after you?
[325:10.87]Jesus.
[325:11.49]The real final boss.
[325:12.60]Like a lawsuit.
[325:35.93]Give me a bike.
[325:36.43]I just want to do this before the stream ends.
[325:38.29]Give me a bike.
[325:38.99]Just give me a bike and I'll be done.
[325:44.39]Find a bike.
[325:45.13]Just cheat?
[325:46.09]Alright, what are like the insane cheats?
[326:01.41]Let's take a look.
[326:02.09]Let's get some absurd cheats here.
[326:05.02]PC cheats, true crime, New York.
[326:08.72]There's got to be something insane, right?
[326:15.58]God.
[326:19.12]New weapons.
[326:21.72]OK, let's see here.
[326:27.14]Spacebar, spacebar, spacebar.
[326:29.22]Okay, hold on.
[326:30.46]Go to the menu during gameplay and then go to the map slash compsat and hold shift and F and then type in the following codes.
[326:38.06]Okay.
[326:38.98]Go to the map and then hold shift and F and then type spacebar, spacebar, spacebar.
[326:43.14]It's 100 bad cop points.
[326:49.54]Driving.
[326:51.76]That's it?
[326:52.08]That's weird.
[327:00.17]Alright, so hold shift and F and then... Okay.
[327:04.52]Everything's unlocked.
[327:06.48]I don't know what that does.
[327:07.40]Is that all I can do?
[327:08.12]I can just give bad or good cop points to myself.
[327:10.40]I don't think I can do anything else.
[327:31.22]Did you enable the debug menu?
[327:32.56]Hold on.
[327:32.86]Let me check this one.
[327:40.06]There's stuff on Xbox.
[327:47.75]Nah, I can't do anything.
[327:49.01]There's no... Hold down the shoulder buttons.
[327:54.75]There are... I'm on the PC version.
[327:57.21]There's no PC... Those are the PC cheats.
[328:02.88]I'm not sure these will work on PC.
[328:04.46]I could try.
[328:05.00]I don't even know what the shoulder button would even be.
[328:08.85]Let's see here.
[328:10.81]BXBX.
[328:12.07]I don't even know what that is.
[328:17.01]I don't think those will work.
[328:25.20]Let's see.
[328:26.46]What would the trigger be?
[328:30.32]Live stuff?
[328:32.57]PC cheats are all terrible.
[328:41.01]What the hell were you thinking, officer?
[328:43.17]You're on street patrol until I know that your head is in the right place.
[328:46.23]Yeah, they can't.
[328:46.73]Got it?
[328:48.19]Oh, well.
[328:50.04]Well, it was worth a shot.
[328:51.86]Alright, Reed.
[328:52.94]What do you got for me this time?
[328:54.96]Reed, right?
[328:55.64]Although I have a lot of money.
[328:56.38]Let me just see what I can do here.
[328:57.88]I actually can't do anything.
[329:03.13]Those are so bad.
[329:04.67]Why have all these awesome cheats for the game and then the PC ones are just... Lower your points by a little.
[329:11.92]That's it.
[329:13.24]That's a true port, man.
[329:18.32]Well, with that being the case, that is going to be the end of the stream.
[329:24.29]Thank you all for watching.
[329:25.11]That has been True Crime New York.
[329:28.57]I am going to try to get... While we sit here, I'm going to try to find a bike.
[329:38.30]That's going to be pretty much the end.
[329:41.05]The detective stream is going to be Saturday.
[329:42.69]If you don't know what that is, that's where I'm going to hide and chat as a fake person.
[329:46.49]And a pre-recorded full stream is going to play.
[329:49.25]And you have to find who I am and chat.
[329:50.79]That's going to be on Saturday.
[329:53.05]Saturday around probably 5 p.m.
[329:54.19]Eastern.
[329:56.34]Should be a lot of fun.
[329:57.24]Or it's going to be an absolute disaster.
[329:59.60]But it'll be worth doing.
[330:00.36]It'll be interesting.
[330:01.04]I don't know what it is.
[330:02.75]That's gonna be fun.
[330:10.08]We have a bot that's ready to go.
[330:13.02]I have multiple fake usernames.
[330:14.86]So don't you worry.
[330:20.92]How long is this stream gonna be?
[330:21.98]It's pretty much over.
[330:22.76]We're gonna read the bits, we're gonna do the credits.
[330:27.34]And then I'm gonna hit the end stream button.
[330:29.73]But I want to try to get in the subway.
[330:33.90]I can't buy anything because I'm a bad cop now.
[330:36.87]I'll find one.
[330:43.43]I will find it.
[330:45.03]Dude, and when I'm not looking for a bike, they show up every five seconds.
[330:51.04]Damn it.
[331:03.21]I could easily just do this.
[331:04.86]But yeah, that'll be Saturday.
[331:07.92]The game doesn't really matter.
[331:09.04]It's going to be... You'll see.
[331:13.66]We kind of talked about it a little bit before, but it's going to be weird.
[331:23.32]Is the alt accounting against terms of service?
[331:27.60]Not in this case, because this is just... This is a joke.
[331:31.02]It's not...
[331:33.04]I'm not making alt accounts to pretend to have viewers or something.
[331:36.96]This is a... It's like a joke.
[331:40.66]So it's not... And everybody's gonna know who it is.
[331:43.59]So it's not like I'm hiding with a different account or something.
[331:48.27]What happens if it's first guess?
[331:49.37]Well, that'd be really funny.
[331:50.91]But I've got like five fake usernames, so... We'll see.
[331:58.04]Give me a fucking bike!
[332:01.90]I blame you for this.
[332:03.20]What the fuck?
[332:06.00]What the fuck?
[332:12.05]New York fucking police.
[332:15.45]You better hope I don't fuck it up too bad.
[332:19.29]No, the way it's gonna work is there's gonna be a period where people can vote.
[332:23.77]So every, like, 10 to 15 minutes, the period will open.
[332:28.25]And you get to...
[332:29.65]accuse somebody and whoever has the number one the amount of accusations is the one that's accused so it's only going to be open for about maybe one or two minutes every like 10 minutes so you have to collectively figure it out nobody gets banned we talked about it at length patrol come in 10 32 stolen police crew
[333:00.68]Alright, I don't see a bike.
[333:10.93]And don't worry.
[333:12.85]There are going to be hints on the stream.
[333:15.15]You're gonna have to figure out what they are.
[333:17.99]You're gonna have to figure out what they mean.
[333:19.50]They might not be...
[333:21.35]That put in front of you.
[333:22.35]It might not be right under your nose.
[333:23.79]It might be random little tidbits that you have to pay attention to that stream.
[333:27.81]Eventually, it's gonna be very, very obvious, and if you don't get it, I mean, like, come on now.
[333:34.68]I don't see a bike.
[333:35.76]Ready to get your ass handed to you?
[333:40.20]Did that hurt?
[333:46.49]There's something back here.
[333:48.13]Whoa!
[333:54.72]You even had the lightning strike.
[333:56.14]Am I going to get under here?
[333:56.84]It's possible I can do this.
[334:00.20]Oh, I got it.
[334:02.34]Okay, so now... Almost.
[334:08.34]Almost.
[334:08.84]Come on.
[334:09.30]Get in there.
[334:12.16]There we go.
[334:13.24]So, um... I can't really take a car under here, but... Okay.
[334:28.57]I'm in an illegal spot.
[334:29.79]I have all the guns, too.
[334:33.09]No, I don't.
[334:33.61]Oh, well.
[334:40.52]Bad.
[334:42.28]Let's just stay under here for a little while.
[334:43.58]Why not?
[334:46.32]I want one of these to drive down here.
[334:53.52]Alright, I gotta get the police to come over here.
[334:57.15]Whoa, whoa, they can shoot down here.
[335:03.91]They can actually aim.
[335:04.83]How the fuck did you do that?
[335:07.47]You gotta be kidding me, dude.
[335:10.88]Shooting through the ground.
[335:11.86]Alright, that's it.
[335:16.28]I'm done.
[335:17.00]That's it.
[335:18.68]That just took all of it out of me.
[335:20.06]That took all the energy out of me right there.
[335:24.61]The joke failed.
[335:28.73]Wallhack's worth both ways, apparently.
[335:32.13]Alright.
[335:33.97]That's gonna be it.
[335:34.83]Let's do the credits.
[335:36.03]Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[335:41.05]Hey, and I'll be right back.
[335:42.21]Credits!

[338:08.13]Thank you guys for subscribing and resubscribing.
[338:27.13]Eventually, I'm hoping that that will be broken up in between the different tiers and how long people have been subbed.
[338:36.26]But for the time being, it is not.
[338:37.64]I'm assuming it'll be added soon, I think.
[338:40.12]I would hope so, at least.
[338:41.70]But, if you're taking off, we're going to do the bits.
[338:43.28]Thank you so much for checking out the stream, you know?
[338:46.18]Thanks for checking out the stream.
[338:49.86]And if you want to show up to the detective stream, it should be interesting.
[338:54.28]I can't promise that stream will be very long, because it might, you know, that's like a weird stream.
[339:01.02]That stream might not be more than an hour or two.
[339:02.90]Who knows?
[339:03.38]It depends on how long it takes.
[339:06.00]But anywho, thank you so much, guys.
[339:07.42]Let's get to the bits.
[339:09.95]And the actual outro.
[339:11.41]That would be nice.
[339:14.25]Drop that a little bit there.
[339:15.49]Okay.
[339:16.83]So from earlier... We've got... Uh-oh...
[339:25.29]Hasnain for the $1.
[339:26.77]Thank you.
[339:28.09]Not late.
[339:28.57]That's true.
[339:30.03]Flabagut for the $1.
[339:30.95]Hey, Jerma, can you maybe sing the theme song to the TV show Frasier?
[339:34.43]I promise I'm not asking with malicious intent.
[339:36.31]It's for research purposes.
[339:37.45]That's the one where he's like... You may be a boy, you're a shot call in.
[339:42.21]I've got all those scrambled eggs.
[339:44.85]There you go.
[339:45.25]That's what you're going to get.
[339:47.71]Danger Illustrated.
[339:48.55]Thanks for the $3.
[339:49.49]I mean, the uncapped FPS is your speedrun.
[339:52.21]That's true.
[339:52.81]Thank you, Danger.
[339:54.93]Radical Corky, thanks for the $1.
[339:56.49]Downloading weapons, have you learned nothing from those PSAs?
[340:00.95]I don't know.
[340:04.78]Thanks, dude.
[340:06.06]Thank you, Eamon Ford, for the $1.
[340:07.16]Does this game have shark cards?
[340:09.34]No.
[340:11.90]It does not, isn't it?
[340:12.44]There's no online multiplayer.
[340:16.24]God O, thanks for the $1.
[340:17.44]El Moto, L-O-Moto.
[340:21.10]Do they still do that in any of the... Does Motorola still exist as a company?
[340:26.47]Or did they go under 10 years ago?
[340:30.27]I have not seen a Motorola commercial in probably 5 to 10 years.
[340:35.67]But VRJosh, thanks for the $5.
[340:38.38]Jerma, that one cell video had me busting up laughing.
[340:40.74]I appreciate all the dumb jokes you do, even if they always don't land.
[340:44.58]Keep being you, man.
[340:45.46]Thanks.
[340:47.91]It's funny because that exact thing came from an end-of-stream hangout session.
[340:53.75]So... Some of the best material is after the stream is over, I would say.
[340:59.73]The behind-the-scenes stuff.
[341:02.25]Your last phone was a Motorola?
[341:06.42]I might look into it again.
[341:07.98]Pretty good ads in this game.
[341:10.50]Thank you, Tell, for the $4.20.
[341:11.30]They just claim... They just claim something. $4.20.
[341:19.88]They say I'm gay.
[341:20.86]Is that right, man?
[341:23.72]Okay.
[341:25.82]Is it?
[341:26.36]What is it?
[341:26.74]It's not 420 yet.
[341:27.58]Yes, it is.
[341:28.20]Oh, God.
[341:29.34]Can't wait for that.
[341:33.23]That's going to be fun.
[341:36.35]Can't wait for all the 420 jokes that are about to happen.
[341:42.35]Bitslave, thanks for the $1.
[341:43.75]Hey, Jerma.
[341:45.80]Thanks so much for your motivation as well as everyone from chat last night.
[341:49.08]I was listening to what you were saying when I told you I was taking the ASVAB today.
[341:54.18]Help me clear my head and stay confident.
[341:55.58]Good, man.
[342:00.13]Hope you did well.
[342:02.27]Hope you nailed it.
[342:06.69]Bitslave again.
[342:08.77]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[342:09.65]I scored a 90 Mechanical, 84 Administration, 89 General, and a 97 Electrical.
[342:15.52]These are percentiles, meaning I did better than 97% of everyone on the electrical portion and so on.
[342:21.77]Not only do I have the scores for the job I wanted, but I have the scores for any job in the enlisted path of the Air Force.
[342:28.19]Now I just have to pass the DLAB.
[342:30.45]Thank you, Jerma, and thank you, chat.
[342:33.78]Well, there you go, man.
[342:37.34]That's pretty spectacular, actually.
[342:42.98]Hell yeah, man.
[342:45.27]Just hit the D-L-A-B out of the park.
[342:48.09]Congratulations, dude.
[342:53.70]And we talked about this before.
[342:55.90]You don't think my viewers aren't exceptionally fucking intelligent?
[343:00.38]You don't think I have an exceptionally intelligent viewer base?
[343:05.77]Oh no, don't worry.
[343:07.01]This guy just got a 97% on this exam for the Air Force.
[343:11.65]He's smarter than 97% of every person.
[343:15.79]ever take that test so I mean hold on a second there only doctors only engineers only lawyers only harvard educated professors and a handful I mean a handful of Burger King workers a handful of them but guess what if you if you have a management position at Burger King even a regular position at Burger King

[343:42.01]A manager at Burger King is a good... That's a well-paying career.
[343:46.19]That's like, what, $20, $25 an hour?
[343:50.30]You work at Lowe's.
[343:52.18]You build things.
[343:52.98]You're a builder.
[343:54.82]Out of rank.
[343:55.68]You build things.

[344:59.37]I was once again duped by that damn monster into giving him Treefitty.
[345:02.71]It's more important now, more than ever, that you catch that thieving crustacean from the Paleolithic era.
[345:08.96]I will do my best.
[345:10.84]Thank you, dude.
[345:12.86]Bitslave, thanks for the 25 cents.
[345:14.26]What the fuck, Reed?
[345:16.22]LOL, why did you shoot the bomb?
[345:20.49]Wait, let me see what this is.
[345:24.15]Was it this guy?
[345:25.66]Oh, it's a clip from what we saw earlier.
[345:27.18]Get over here.
[345:28.70]Oh, no.
[345:29.42]It wasn't this guy.
[345:31.70]Oh, that's when I shot the... Oh, yeah.
[345:37.61]That scream.
[345:39.01]That... Oh, my God.
[345:41.25]No.
[345:42.37]She knew what I was gonna do.
[345:44.71]She was watching the stream on her laptop.
[345:47.12]That's what she was doing.
[345:50.17]She did not want to see that happen.
[345:52.05]She had twitch.tv/Jerma985 on her computer, because she was sitting there watching.
[345:58.72]Thanks, man.
[346:03.10]This game is fucking hilarious.
[346:05.74]And he also says, stop doing this to citizens.
[346:08.05]Stop doing what?
[346:08.91]Stop doing...
[346:11.17]Mm-hmm.
[346:12.13]Sure.
[346:13.65]That was pretty good because you got me to click on the first one, which wasn't the snort.
[346:17.57]And then you got me to click on the second one because I assumed it was going to be a continuation of that.
[346:23.42]And you got me.
[346:24.18]So good work.
[346:30.54]Pitslave again with 25 cents.
[346:32.52]Oh, forgot the link to the other clip.
[346:35.19]Yeah, you did.
[346:36.13]Are you sure?
[346:36.65]Because this is the same.
[346:37.43]I'm not even going to click it.
[346:38.41]We already just clicked it.
[346:39.27]Thanks, dude.
[346:40.27]Thank you for the 25 cents.
[346:41.99]Three times.
[346:45.56]Snort rolled.
[346:46.90]Garfield, the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[346:48.98]I came to ask for her advice.
[346:51.48]My girlfriend is always extremely busy with work or travel to different countries for international policy.
[346:57.08]I swear I'm not making this up.
[346:59.20]Not only that, but I'm being relocated to another studio.
[347:02.41]Hobbs, Snoopy...
[347:11.36]How do you suggest keeping in contact with friends and significant... long-distance friends and... Well, I would say... That... Why am I even answering this?
[347:22.15]Correctly.
[347:22.81]Why would I answer this?
[347:24.27]This is just you.
[347:25.05]This is somebody LARPing as Garfield.
[347:27.30]And I'm about to actually answer this question.
[347:32.52]How about... How about no?
[347:33.76]How about...
[347:38.59]Sure, Garfield.
[347:39.49]You and Snoopy can keep contact with each other.
[347:44.41]And you don't want to use Skype and FaceChat.
[347:47.11]So get an iPhone and make sure they both have iMessenger and send... I'm replying to somebody pretending to be a cartoon character.
[347:57.36]Thank you, Corgi, for the 50 cents.
[347:59.50]I love you, buddy.
[348:00.04]I love you, too.
[348:00.54]Thanks, dude.
[348:02.20]MetalSand, thanks for the 25 cents.
[348:03.50]I don't believe in Garfields.
[348:05.50]Cats hate lasagna.
[348:09.27]Answer the question.
[348:10.87]I don't know how you keep in touch with long-distance friends.
[348:13.81]Here's what you do, for real.
[348:15.84]If you have a good friend that you know that has moved away or somebody that you know for a while or a girlfriend or something, always try to make an effort once a year to go do something.
[348:29.05]Go do anything together.
[348:31.89]Hey, what's up, man?
[348:33.39]What's up, girl or whatever?
[348:35.19]I haven't talked to you in a while.
[348:37.83]What do you say?
[348:38.79]Let's get the gang back together and let's go get a hotel in Philly and just spend like a weekend in Philly.
[348:46.15]And then you can catch up.
[348:46.97]You can talk about how your lives are doing.
[348:48.27]And then you can talk.
[348:48.83]You can see each other and have fun.
[348:50.60]And then you go home and do it again next year.
[348:52.66]Always make a point to do it.
[348:57.54]That's what I would do.
[349:00.90]Get a hotel.
[349:01.36]Yeah, go get like a hotel.
[349:04.06]Go live it up.
[349:04.52]Go take as many showers as you want.
[349:08.85]And where's this pixel on jermaEarth?
[349:10.37]I don't believe you.
[349:14.11]I'm not saying you have to go to Philadelphia.
[349:15.57]I'm just saying that it's an option.
[349:18.05]There are tons of cities in this country.
[349:19.67]And if you're not even from this country, there are tons of countries in your country area.
[349:23.48]If you're from Europe, you can get in a car and be in a different country in like an hour and 25 minutes.
[349:30.76]Go check out one of the other countries.
[349:34.04]Get in that car.
[349:35.79]Meet in... I don't know.
[349:41.33]Denmark or something.
[349:43.57]Meet in... I don't know.
[349:45.29]Go to France.
[349:46.05]Meet somewhere in France.
[349:47.01]Paris.
[349:47.87]It's going to take an hour drive for all of you guys.
[349:51.22]You live in Australia.
[349:52.06]Where do you go?
[349:55.72]You have to get on a plane.
[349:56.78]Or you have to have other people in Australia.
[350:01.43]Top right of the hat.
[350:05.07]Oh, no.
[350:06.59]Delete it.
[350:08.98]But anyways, thank you, MetalSand.
[350:10.72]Thank you, ProSiftProStar, for the 25 cents.
[350:12.50]My favorite thing about this True Crying game is that the voices pierce through everything.
[350:16.92]And the same line plays 50 times in two minutes.
[350:21.46]Yeah, it's pretty, um... It's pretty intense.
[350:25.91]Thank you, WildHabuddy, for the $1.00.
[350:29.01]If every officer was like Jerma, I think there would be no crime.
[350:31.61]This guy is like if Judge Dredd was a clown.
[350:38.04]I'll take that as a compliment.
[350:40.30]Thank you, Xtome9001, for the $1.
[350:42.74]Is this your first day on the job?
[350:43.90]No, it's the second day on the job.
[350:44.90]We streamed two days ago, the same game.
[350:48.16]Thanks, little dude.
[350:50.00]CBY TV, thanks for the $3.
[350:52.30]They say, uh, vo-he-he-o, vo-hi-o, whatever that means.
[350:56.48]Can somebody put that in the chat?
[350:58.02]That's a better twitch.tv thing, right?
[350:59.87]I don't even have that.
[351:00.87]I can't see it.
[351:03.09]That's a magical emote to me.
[351:04.91]I don't know what it is.
[351:07.51]Spreeo, thanks for the $1.
[351:08.59]They say, haha, the cringe emote.
[351:14.36]I don't know why.
[351:14.98]Five hours must have been a really, really cringey moment for me.
[351:18.84]Tom Fullery, thanks for the $5.
[351:22.14]Long time fan, Jerma.
[351:23.22]Thank you for making good content that's helped a lot of people through hard times.
[351:25.92]Keep it up, man.
[351:27.90]Thank you.
[351:30.68]Thank you so much, Tom.
[351:34.21]Hope you stick around.
[351:36.89]Much love to you, dude.
[351:39.23]Rogue Fort Zero.
[351:40.13]Thanks for the $1.
[351:40.95]Hey, Jerma.
[351:41.57]Me again.
[351:42.03]Got another game for you.
[351:43.16]Fury.
[351:44.22]Gonna stop you there.
[351:45.32]Already streamed.
[351:47.24]Already played it, already streamed it, and already... I beat, like, what, six bosses before I gave up forever?
[351:52.58]We got, like, into boss five, six, or seven?
[351:56.10]That was a great game, but it was... My brain just couldn't handle it after, like, this is the sixth or such boss.
[352:01.84]But thank you for the recommendation.
[352:04.00]Appreciate it, dude.
[352:10.03]When did I stream it?
[352:10.65]This was, like, a year and a half ago.
[352:12.61]This was a long time ago.
[352:13.41]It was pretty much right when it came out.
[352:18.60]I would say pretty much right when it came out.
[352:22.44]Or at least like a week or so within it.
[352:24.93]Thanks, man.
[352:25.35]Thanks for the $1.
[352:26.09]Thanks, dude.
[352:26.41]Thank you, Calm Slime, for the $2.
[352:28.17]Hey, Jerma.
[352:28.57]Hope you're doing good.
[352:29.67]What is that?
[352:30.07]I'm looking it up right now.
[352:34.77]Okay.
[352:47.88]the voy voy heo is that it oh it's that it's oh it's like the happy the the fun like the wrench next to my head right that's like the your site is under construction with the wrench up like I'm fixing it yeah just holding both their hands in the airs it's like sorry the page you got to cannot be used okay
[353:19.01]Now I see.
[353:24.72]Alright, so.
[353:25.14]What do we got here?
[353:28.80]We left off.
[353:33.00]But thank you, ComSlam.
[353:35.63]Thank you, Senpai of Cream Pie.
[353:42.23]Thanks for the $1, dude.
[353:43.13]Stop being so mean.
[353:47.30]You thought it was a rope?
[353:49.39]Wait, what is that?
[353:50.25]It's not... Thank you, MetalSand for the 39 cents.
[353:57.63]Soup for the soup, God.
[353:58.93]Thank you.
[354:00.57]ConvoBreaker, thanks for $3.
[354:03.25]Dear Jerma, what in the actual, genuine, literal monster hell fuck is jermaMustard supposed to be?
[354:07.87]And where did it come from?
[354:08.61]It looks like someone stained my monitor with their pee and I don't know how to use it.
[354:12.58]I'm going to explain it again.
[354:16.73]I'm going to have to explain this every time, by the way.
[354:19.27]That was a lost emote.
[354:20.81]The chat unlocked that emote two nights ago.
[354:25.44]I made that one.
[354:27.42]I didn't like it.
[354:28.92]It was supposed to be a comcast.
[354:30.74]That's supposed to be my face being ripped apart by internet rays.
[354:34.20]It didn't go where I wanted.
[354:38.00]Chat saw it, and they unlocked it.
[354:40.42]All they had to do was type in a bunch of random codes into the chat, and I unlocked it.
[354:45.42]That's what it was supposed to be, and they voted on it, and they voted for Mustard.
[354:49.82]So that's just the way it is, unfortunately.
[354:54.35]Why Mustard?
[354:54.93]Yeah, because I put a poll up, and everyone wanted that on the poll, and it won by a lot.
[355:07.84]Makes way more sense now.
[355:08.96]Yeah, I'm going to rename it to, like, Jerma...
[355:12.06]To, like, Zap or Comcast or Internet or something.
[355:17.11]It doesn't make any sense as mustard.
[355:19.49]It doesn't even look like mustard.
[355:23.43]You get it for three days.
[355:24.21]But anyways.
[355:28.59]Thank you, Corgi, for the 50 cents.
[355:29.87]How does someone become as cool and hilarious as you?
[355:33.30]I don't know.
[355:38.28]I don't know.
[355:38.86]There is a way.
[355:41.22]I mean...
[355:43.18]Maybe... I don't know.
[355:45.64]I don't find myself to be that cool.
[355:49.98]You know what I mean?
[355:51.46]I just say the things that come out of my mouth.
[355:55.73]You could go to funny school, though, which is what I highly recommend.
[355:59.11]I got my degree in funnyism.
[356:02.25]A lot of... Some of the most talented clowns taught me all the jokes that I know, pretty much.
[356:15.55]But, yeah.
[356:18.55]Yeah, but I mean, I wasn't even going to use it.
[356:19.99]Everyone's talking about how, like, shitty it is, the emote.
[356:22.69]I wasn't going to use it.
[356:25.95]And then I apparently had to use it.
[356:29.43]Humble brag.
[356:30.33]Yeah, I was taught by Big Bird.
[356:33.69]It's not Filofagus.
[356:35.45]Bert, Ernie.
[356:37.67]The Count.
[356:39.63]Okay, I need to name somebody else that's not on Sesame Street.
[356:42.22]Because that's not even comedy.
[356:45.84]Whatever.
[356:47.64]Thank you, Spreo, for the 75 cents.
[356:49.14]Will you never catch me alive?
[356:51.24]You will never catch me alive.
[356:52.74]Yes.
[356:53.78]The next one is guaranteed absolutely the snort clip.
[357:01.43]Nope.
[357:02.63]It is not.
[357:03.13]In fact, it's something else.
[357:05.33]What?
[357:08.76]I tried to- I tried to stop it.
[357:12.18]I tried to turn it off like three times and I kept replaying it.
[357:19.01]Hey, thanks man.
[357:23.73]Thanks, Bitslip.
[357:25.37]Thank you Stix Renegade for the one dollar.
[357:26.87]What was that fucking Marv Merchants from Home Alone scream?
[357:31.10]That what is- Is this the same thing?
[357:44.42]The thing is... Oh!
[357:44.98]It is somewhere... Like... I thought I was gonna grab him.
[357:52.38]And even if you watch the clip, like, watch that clip back.
[357:55.48]And, like, you'll see.
[357:56.42]I press the button next to him.
[357:58.88]And I kind of really... I shove into him.
[358:01.18]I push into him.
[358:03.03]It should have grabbed him.
[358:04.49]And it just threw me off the edge.
[358:05.85]Like, that was not... I actually should have grabbed him there.
[358:11.01]I'm sorry.
[358:11.81]I just really should have.
[358:17.61]But anyways, thanks, man.
[358:18.39]Thanks, Stix Renegade.
[358:20.49]Uh, SuperSeal, thanks for the 25 cents.
[358:22.13]I'm going to turn your scream into my new TF2 hit sound.
[358:26.91]Okay, I'm not cli- I just- I get it.
[358:29.49]I'm not gonna click any more of the clips.
[358:34.55]Spreeo, thanks for the $1.
[358:35.77]Streamer tilted.
[358:36.57]Oh, I was... I was... literally shaking.
[358:41.41]You know what I mean?
[358:42.53]Fuck the joke.
[358:43.67]Fuck, like, the meme.
[358:45.19]I was literally shaking.
[358:47.71]Because that was the third time that it happened.
[358:53.44]And then I'm thinking in my head, people think I'm doing this on fucking purpose.
[358:56.34]Like, I'm not doing it.
[358:57.16]I wasn't doing it on purpose.
[358:59.36]Like, dude, I'm tired of this joke.
[359:01.58]It's like, well, I swear to God it wasn't a joke.
[359:03.92]I'm just that stupid.
[359:05.60]But it wasn't even that stupid.
[359:07.14]Some of those were actually... One or two of those was actually the game, like, fucked me.
[359:16.82]Anyways, thank you, LuckyBone, for the $1.
[359:18.38]Failed fish, yeah.
[359:20.26]Uh, D. Bruun.
[359:23.35]Uh, Debroi Vince.
[359:24.75]Thanks for the $1.35.
[359:25.97]Sorry, streamer, but the Tommy fight on that mission is actually bugged.
[359:29.95]I don't think it's ever been fixed.
[359:31.85]You literally couldn't push him off.
[359:35.15]Somehow got him off.
[359:36.81]I was pressing that button as fast as I could.
[359:40.79]Maybe you're not supposed to beat that, but maybe I rebroke the game because I was hitting 7 on my number pad and 9 on my number pad so much that if it had gone on for another 5 to 10 seconds, I would have physically hurt myself with pressing the button.
[359:59.14]I would have broken my finger or something.
[360:01.18]So, come on.
[360:02.96]I can handle this.
[360:05.63]Thank you, UV Sensitive, for the 25 cents.
[360:07.95]PJ Saul.
[360:09.44]That absolutely needs to be used.
[360:12.20]Swifty Bagel, thanks for the $1.75.
[360:13.36]Hey, guys.
[360:13.56]His guys took care of you.
[360:14.18]Yes, they did.
[360:21.10]Lucky Bone, thanks for the two bucks.
[360:22.70]DansGame.
[360:24.50]Lucky Bone again for the one dollar.
[360:25.96]DansGame.
[360:27.80]Oh, I was freaking out.
[360:29.80]I was having a... The thing is, that was one of those... That was a meltdown that I have sometimes where... I thought that was hilarious.
[360:36.99]Everything about that was fucking hilarious.
[360:38.99]But...
[360:40.00]I mean, my ego was getting in check there, you know what I mean?
[360:43.48]Like, I'm laughing so hard about how fucked up that was, and at the same time, fuck, man.
[360:49.56]My ego is getting just, like, slapped around right now.
[360:52.58]And, like, it was equally parts infuriating and equally parts funny for me.
[360:56.38]I was being torn in half.
[360:58.06]Like, that would have been the part of the movie where I split, and the evil Jeremy goes that way, and the good Jeremy goes this way, and the rest of the movie is us fighting because I was having such a meltdown.
[361:11.84]And the game was running faster.
[361:17.69]So, yeah.
[361:18.81]That's where I got split.
[361:21.99]Ego, in quotes.
[361:23.31]Well, I mean, like, I'm talking, like, my ego is being just ripped in half.
[361:31.21]Ego doesn't mean, like, I'm, like, egotistical.
[361:33.15]Like, ego is just, like, how you think about yourself.
[361:35.43]You know what I mean?
[361:36.09]Like, your ego.
[361:39.43]Like, when somebody has an ego, like, anybody can have an ego, right?
[361:43.82]So, the definition of ego is a person's sense of self-esteem is ego.
[361:52.72]It was being tried back then.
[361:57.50]You lost your ego on shrooms.
[361:59.46]What?
[362:02.17]Am I the only person that did a full playthrough on fast mode?
[362:04.69]I don't know.
[362:06.27]That's a good question.
[362:07.27]If it even was really happening, you know.
[362:11.89]Do not become Piccolo.
[362:13.31]Did that happen to Piccolo?
[362:15.09]Did he fall off the edge in a fucking video game to a point where he became another character in Dragon Ball?
[362:21.19]Maybe.
[362:23.21]Uh, thank you TechnoToast for the 75 cents.
[362:25.18]Jerma, I love you and I just want to tell you that you'll never catch me alive.
[362:28.82]My guys will take care of you.
[362:30.98]Thank you.
[362:32.28]Wash Jose, thanks for the $1.01.
[362:34.58]A wise man once said, my guys will take care of you, can't catch me alive.
[362:41.40]Uh, Zeans Ravus, thanks for the $5 here.
[362:44.44]Appreciate it, man.
[362:46.96]Yulcarps, thanks for the $1.
[362:48.60]I wuv you.
[362:50.07]Uh, O-W-O.
[362:51.51]I said it.
[362:53.81]Uh, $2 from Fist.
[362:57.49]And then something about Kryken.
[362:59.55]Thank you for the $2.
[363:00.37]Appreciate it.
[363:01.76]Mr. Crit123, thanks for the $1.
[363:03.56]Is this Fall Climbing Simulator?
[363:07.48]Yes.
[363:08.80]Cigarette Spaghetti gave $100 earlier.
[363:10.64]We acknowledged it, but again, thank you, dude.
[363:12.18]Thank you for the fucking $100.
[363:14.10]And right after that, Topac gave $50.
[363:17.94]Acknowledge it again, because it's a lot of money.
[363:20.20]Thank you, guys, both of you.
[363:22.70]You're too kind.
[363:24.80]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[363:26.20]Do the funny fall joke.
[363:27.64]Haha.
[363:29.78]Pisty, thanks for $15.
[363:32.24]The dude gave you $100 with a simple request, and you ignored him.
[363:36.02]And to think I looked up to you, Jerma.
[363:39.96]I don't know.
[363:40.58]I mean, I fell off that ledge.
[363:42.94]It's like four times.
[363:44.34]I had to restart a 15 minute level.
[363:47.26]Like three or four different times.
[363:49.98]I can't.
[363:50.38]You're going to bring me back to where you're going to make me relive that moment.
[363:57.85]Thank you, Pisty, for the $15.
[364:01.17]Joel's Skype password.
[364:02.75]Thanks for the five bucks.
[364:05.03]Say, hey, Jeremiah, thanks for streaming and being awesome.
[364:08.73]Well, thank you for giving me five dollars.
[364:10.19]That's very kind of you.
[364:13.59]Thank you.
[364:16.20]MetalSand, thanks for the 25 cents.
[364:17.56]Hey, Jerma, thanks for ruining my dreams by dying to train.
[364:21.66]Sorry.
[364:24.08]What is this one?
[364:24.68]A new adventure begins.
[364:28.18]What are you, what's, where are you?
[364:29.17]Fuck, shit, dead, fucking asshole, fuck.
[364:32.07]What happened?
[364:32.77]Whoa, when did I do this?
[364:37.49]When did I do that?
[364:38.19]That was like scary.
[364:39.93]When did I do this?
[364:40.93]What the fuck?
[364:43.79]Whoa.
[364:47.59]That came out, that was mean.
[364:49.69]That was, I don't like that clip.
[364:52.97]I don't like that one.
[364:55.70]You know when you forget, so guys, a lot of you don't know, but maybe you do.
[365:00.44]More than half the shit that I've ever done on camera.
[365:03.78]or on stream, or on video, I don't even remember saying some of these things.
[365:09.16]So... Sometimes I'll watch a video, I remember back in the day, when you used to do dual commentaries, and like three or four people, and there's gonna be three or four different videos!
[365:21.14]I would forget about them, and like weeks later, I would watch the other perspective, and watch somebody else's video, and be like, what the fuck am I doing?
[365:29.56]When did I do that?
[365:30.40]It's like I forgot everything.
[365:35.83]But let's be fair though, I'm gonna be fair.
[365:39.19]To give me a little bit of slack, I have probably been recorded thousands of times, right?
[365:47.54]I have probably been, in quotes, on mic for like 200, 2000 hours across like a bunch of channels on Twitch.
[365:59.59]I've probably been, my voice has been captured thousands and thousands of fucking, thousands of hours.
[366:08.72]You've been recorded for longer than I've shat in my life.
[366:12.04]Yeah, so if I don't remember me screaming swears and being mean... What a terrible excuse.
[366:19.59]Famous streamer.
[366:20.53]No, just because you've done a bunch of times doesn't mean that you're famous.
[366:29.69]Start a fun to shoot this beam jermaSnort into space.
[366:35.16]No, you gotta bury it in a time capsule.
[366:37.95]And that's it.
[366:38.39]It would be an iPad with one video on, and you'd have to press play, and that was it.
[366:42.13]Anyways, thank you, Joel.
[366:46.79]And thank you, Metal Sand.
[366:48.33]Thank you to Salston for the $5.
[366:50.02]Appreciate it, man.
[366:52.74]Grim Wyatt, thanks for the $1.
[366:54.36]Turn off aimbot.
[366:56.52]It's an old third-person shooter.
[366:58.28]They all have it.
[367:00.58]Chemical Crash, thanks for the $5.
[367:02.02]They just say, cheer, Jerma.
[367:03.94]Thank you, dude.
[367:06.36]MetalSand, with 25 cents, the last guy pressed enter too quickly.
[367:14.74]SargentChickenWing, thanks for the one dollar.
[367:16.63]Hey Jerma, here's the fix for the game running at 1.5x speed.
[367:20.53]It's a known problem.
[367:21.73]And then he links the PC gaming wiki.
[367:24.85]Issue fixed.
[367:27.02]Well, we completed the game.
[367:30.18]The game is beaten.
[367:32.57]You think almost x2 speed is going to stop a top 1000 streamer from being able to not take that on?
[367:41.58]Why did you say banana milk bag?
[367:47.28]Banana milk bag?
[367:48.72]Why are you saying that now?
[367:53.75]Thanks, though, dude.
[367:54.73]Appreciate the... Appreciate the one buck, Sargent.
[368:01.11]Chemical crash again.
[368:01.87]Thanks for one buck.
[368:02.55]I'm going to the store.
[368:03.43]You want anything?
[368:05.77]Fuck, I'm out of food, man.
[368:06.85]I gotta go to the grocery store.
[368:09.19]There really only is eggs in my fridge.
[368:10.79]I have to go eat like another four hard-boiled eggs.
[368:15.38]My diet today, food consumption, was eight eggs.
[368:21.48]That's it.
[368:22.40]And coffee.
[368:25.12]Oh well.
[368:25.76]I'll wake up early tomorrow, hopefully.
[368:29.71]Grim Wyatt, thanks for the $2.
[368:32.45]PJ Salt, this never would have happened if you'd used the noob tube.
[368:37.17]Mm-hmm.
[368:39.17]A coconut.
[368:40.37]Thank you, Coconut Lips, for the $1.
[368:42.71]Jeremy, you really need to see this.
[368:43.81]You could be banned for this.
[368:49.76]Nope.
[368:53.82]Thank you, MetalSand, for the 25 cents.
[368:56.24]The real villain was your lack of a parental figure to keep you in line.
[368:59.76]You're destroying the city.
[369:08.78]Thank you, Topac, for the 10 bucks.
[369:13.03]And they say NinjaTupac.
[369:16.05]A Tupac.
[369:17.05]Tupac is OP.
[369:21.23]He was up until the very end.
[369:25.20]Thank you for the 10 bucks though, dude.
[369:26.42]Appreciate it.
[369:29.76]Utopia Fox with $15 here.
[369:31.95]Thank you for the 15 bucks, Utopia.
[369:34.47]My grandma gave me this.
[369:35.85]BibleThump.
[369:39.57]The $15?
[369:39.79]Well, thank you for giving it to me.
[369:43.85]Thanks, dude.
[369:47.21]He's so sick of it.
[369:49.74]I'm really not.
[369:51.38]It's fun.
[369:51.98]I like that you guys like it.
[369:53.20]You know what I mean?
[369:55.27]But thank you, though.
[369:56.61]Thank you, Roger Cheeto, for the $2.
[369:58.33]Hey, Jerma, great stream.
[369:59.43]Best clip of the night.
[370:01.21]And they say in brackets, I promise it's not the snort clip.
[370:07.80]Do I do it?
[370:10.24]Well, you were right.
[370:16.84]Something else.
[370:18.24]Thanks, dude.
[370:18.68]Thank you, Grim White, for the $1.
[370:20.22]Put him in the cooler.
[370:21.58]I didn't.
[370:22.11]I wish I did.
[370:23.95]Snoozencopter, what's up, man?
[370:26.21]How you doing, man?
[370:27.85]Thanks for the $1.
[370:29.97]Back in Germany again and finally able to catch one of the streams.
[370:32.49]Meeting you and this random guy that probably gave you the badge was really, really cool.
[370:39.33]Made the trip to America really worth it.
[370:41.28]And whenever I look at your autograph on my phone case, I get a big smile on my face.
[370:45.98]Thank you for being who you are, Jerma.
[370:47.27]P.S.
[370:47.55]My mom was so happy with that birthday message.
[370:50.55]She doesn't stop telling me how much of a nice guy you are.
[370:52.83]Thanks, man.
[370:54.47]I'm glad the trip back to Germany was safe.
[370:56.89]It was an absolute pleasure to hang out with you guys for the couple of times that I was at PAX.
[371:05.94]And yeah, happy birthday.
[371:07.26]Happy birthday to mom.
[371:10.26]By the way, if you're...
[371:12.75]If you're out of the loop here.
[371:15.81]This is somebody referencing the PAX meetup that I did.
[371:19.98]So, it was a lot of fun.
[371:22.54]Got to meet a lot of great people.
[371:25.68]I love to do that shit.
[371:28.00]I'm really sad I couldn't do it last year.
[371:30.58]Because I got really sick.
[371:31.90]But... It was awesome.
[371:35.14]Thank you so much, Snooze and Copter.
[371:39.30]Have a great rest of your night or morning.
[371:41.26]What is it?
[371:41.60]Like 6 in the morning right now?
[371:42.76]Did you just wake up?
[371:45.30]It's fucking early right now.
[371:48.51]Thanks, man.
[371:48.93]Thank you to Convo Breaker for the 25 cents.
[371:51.23]If Jupiter won the Jerma Rumble, get fired and go on vacation.
[371:55.01]Even he would have gotten a hat on each one of his four emotes.
[372:00.08]No, I would have just redone it so the middle of his face had like a sunburn on it or something.
[372:06.24]You think I'd really get away with deleting the Jupiter?
[372:10.55]People would be so angry.
[372:12.67]If I deleted JermaJupiter, all four of them, I really truly believe that like 500 people would unsubscribe.
[372:20.72]I'm certain of that.
[372:27.72]RoboGandalf, thanks for the $5.10.
[372:28.78]I love you.
[372:30.46]Thank you.
[372:31.56]Thank you for the $5.10, man.
[372:32.96]Appreciate that.
[372:35.17]NorthFriendFP, thanks for the $2.00.
[372:40.38]He must have all.
[372:41.10]Talking about bits?
[372:45.74]Thanks, man.
[372:47.22]Broluck, thanks for the $1.
[372:48.36]Hey, man, a lot of streamers are enjoying your jermaMustard emote.
[372:50.84]We talked about this earlier.
[372:52.52]Who are you talking about?
[372:54.44]What streamers have seen my mustard emote and been like, oh, that's great.
[372:58.08]I love that.
[373:00.40]Do they have their glasses on?
[373:01.46]Oh, then right after that, Broluck says, I'll show you soon.
[373:07.60]Thanks for the $1 again, dude.
[373:12.13]Emperor Zoran, thanks for the 25 cents.
[373:13.67]Hello, Jerma.
[373:14.25]You might remember me as NotDeadModKyle.
[373:17.19]Just wanted to know that the two months finally ended and that I finally got my original name back.
[373:22.23]Feels good.
[373:24.53]Well, that's good.
[373:25.97]I'm glad you got your original username.
[373:31.27]But thank you for returning as Emperor Zoran.
[373:38.54]500 people is 2500 a month that is what Saturn is worth to Jerma that's what Saturn is worth I'm never changing this name again good bit slave thanks for the 25 cents sorry about giving you advice that caused you to lose if only I knew the guns would despawn hey it was actually pretty sound advice
[374:08.88]It just didn't work out.
[374:11.08]But it's okay because I put on my gamer skill.
[374:13.37]I put on my gamer goggles and I ended up taking them off.
[374:15.99]So it was all good.
[374:16.93]Thanks, though.
[374:18.97]Captain Frodo, thanks for the 25 cents.
[374:20.53]Gotta use the grenade launcher to beat the final boss.
[374:24.97]Or be stuck in a train.
[374:26.93]Delete part of Jupiter for one stream and don't say anything.
[374:34.51]No, just replace it with something else.
[374:37.33]Something that would match, but doesn't work quite so well.
[374:41.57]It would be like a winking face or something.
[374:44.07]So Jerkbritter would be winking.
[374:46.23]Maybe I'll do that one day.
[374:47.27]Just to be fucking weird.
[374:49.65]Broluck, thanks for the $1.
[374:50.86]Bad cop, bad ending.
[374:53.44]That was the bad ending.
[374:56.56]Broluck, thanks for the $2.
[374:57.40]This is a video of other Twitch streamers reacting to jermaMustard.
[375:02.56]It's a YouTube link.
[375:10.23]Wait, did you- you made like a compilation video?
[375:16.28]Why is this so many- what is this?
[375:20.04]No, it's not.
[375:21.50]What the fuck?
[375:23.80]How many people did you do this to?
[375:27.99]I am so confused right now.
[375:29.89]Check out this legit Twitch emote, cost me $20.
[375:36.16]Dude, what is that Twitch emote?
[375:38.01]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[375:40.61]That one didn't cost you $20.
[375:41.77]That wasn't $20.
[375:49.69]That was, that's, that's a regular emote.
[375:57.37]Posted in chat.
[375:58.07]Alright, well, here, I'm going to, I don't, I don't, I can't.
[376:01.93]Let's, well, we can't watch, I don't want to watch this on stream.
[376:04.26]Here's the link if you want to watch it.
[376:07.40]but there's like other streamers, I don't want to like stream other streamers.
[376:11.81]I actually don't think you can do that.
[376:15.17]Maybe you can and I'm just being a fucking paranoid weirdo, but you can watch it, click on it.
[376:20.89]How many people did you do this to?
[376:25.57]There's like at least 10 different streamers here.
[376:33.64]All these people are gonna think I'm a fucking psycho.
[376:37.07]Oh, this is exactly what I didn't want to have happen.
[376:41.22]Oh my god.
[376:44.40]This is exactly the thing we were talking about.
[376:46.48]It's a four minute video.
[376:50.04]Banned for stream sniping.
[376:57.09]Lied about the price.
[377:00.71]Oh no.
[377:04.81]No, now we have to delete Mustard.
[377:08.29]No, now I have to make Mustard the $25 remote.
[377:10.53]Oh, this is my fault?
[377:19.30]Why is this my fault?
[377:20.44]This is not my fault.
[377:27.60]I'm skipping ahead to see what somebody says.
[377:31.05]I'm so self-conscious.
[377:31.83]I don't even want to watch this video.
[377:33.65]I'm going to pick one part of the video to watch.
[377:36.19]Mustard.
[377:36.61]That was a quick-throw pop.
[377:40.59]Bro, that's pretty cool.
[377:47.23]I bought this emote for $20.
[377:49.38]Was it worth it?
[377:51.36]Hey, man.
[377:52.98]Worth is all relative.
[377:55.36]And if you're getting your worth out of it, then fuck yeah.
[377:58.04]Then I'm happy for you.
[378:00.62]What do you think of this $20 emote?
[378:05.47]What face?
[378:07.23]Nobody likes it.
[378:08.13]I don't even know what the fuck that emote is.
[378:12.06]You just bought this emote for $20.
[378:13.62]What?
[378:14.76]I can't fucking believe this shit.
[378:16.92]Hi, Burlak.
[378:18.80]Um, that looks great.
[378:22.76]That sounds like Jenna.
[378:25.08]I mean, the way it spins.
[378:26.06]You bought that emote for $20?
[378:27.50]What do I think?
[378:28.23]No, you didn't.
[378:31.25]like he knows he knew you want amounted for twenty dollars twenty dollars dude jermaMustard what the oh my god uh what even is that bro like what even is that an emote of mate oh god they hate it what do I do about this like a flaming smudge I can't tell
[379:03.16]What is going on there?
[379:05.78]Uh, I bought this emote for $20.
[379:07.98]What do you think?
[379:09.12]It's pretty good.
[379:09.68]Hey!
[379:11.44]We got good feedback.
[379:13.57]It is lava.
[379:14.95]It is... Wait, this lava is... It is a lot of trash.
[379:19.05]Oh my god.
[379:19.79]Fucking god.
[379:20.71]You guys are too much sometimes.
[379:28.00]especially because you had to lie about how much you spent on it oh yeah yeah thanks dude thank you techno toast for the 75 cents five fake usernames for the detective stream does that mean if we have to guess each one in every one of those accounts are you going to be a video game boss with multiple forms uh well no those five accounts are are for the very very potential possibility of for some reason the first two or three of them are instantly guessed
[379:54.90]It's gonna be very hard, but probability-wise, I just want to make sure I cover all my bases.
[380:00.99]Thank you all for attending the jermaMustard funeral.
[380:03.19]Hey man, what do you think about this emote?
[380:05.57]I paid 20 bucks for it.
[380:06.51]I think it fucking sucks.
[380:14.96]I gotta watch that off stream and cry.
[380:18.24]Thank you Topac for the $1.
[380:21.29]I'm sure you probably mentioned this before, but have you considered PayPal, Streamlabs?
[380:25.44]I'm sick of giving Jeff Bezos all my money.
[380:28.20]I'm going to announce it now.
[380:30.64]Are you ready?
[380:35.18]Fuck Patreon.
[380:36.19]Fuck Kickstarter.
[380:37.01]We're not doing any one of those two things.
[380:38.73]Here's what's going to happen.
[380:40.59]Drum roll, please.
[380:43.13]That was not really a drum roll, but eventually here in like a month or two.
[380:49.68]There's going to be a stream where I'm going to be opening up a PayPal.
[380:57.71]Not a Kickstarter, not a Patreon, none of that shit.
[381:01.05]We're just doing a separate other PayPal account that is going to be only for videos.
[381:09.78]That's it.
[381:12.30]That money is not money that I'm going to take as like income.
[381:14.79]That's not money that I'm going to be using for anything in particular.
[381:17.63]It's not going to be like, oh, I'm going to dip into that and buy a sandwich.
[381:20.37]Nope.
[381:20.69]It's going to be a separate business PayPal account.
[381:23.97]Did I just, I said fuck PayPal?
[381:25.17]I said, no, I meant to say Patreon.
[381:26.59]Fuck PayPal too.
[381:27.27]PayPal sucks as well.
[381:28.39]They all suck.
[381:31.02]They're all bad.
[381:33.56]But that's the theory.
[381:36.43]is it's going to be just a separate, not linked to me, it's not going to be a, hey, thanks for the thousand dollars, dude.
[381:43.85]Can't wait to go on vacation.
[381:45.75]Nope, it's only going to be a pool of money for videos.
[381:48.16]That's it.
[381:51.96]PayPal shows your address.
[381:53.10]That is not true if it is a business PayPal.
[381:56.50]If you set up a separate business account, you can just have it be a business name.
[382:01.62]There doesn't have to be an address linked to it.
[382:04.88]That should be fine.
[382:07.57]uh because I thought about it some more and I really don't want to do Patreon is not only does Patreon take some money Kickstarter takes money but you have to have it would be it would be weird doing a Patreon because sometimes videos would take more than a month to make sometimes streams that I want to make will take more than you know of one payment period right like in quotes
[382:33.12]And then a Kickstarter for one video.
[382:34.66]But then you give away what the video is or what the stream is.
[382:37.44]And I really don't want to do that.
[382:38.76]Because there's a particular stream coming up here in the next three or four weeks.
[382:44.66]I don't want it to be given away.
[382:50.56]Having more than one PayPal account is complicated without an LLC.
[382:54.25]I'm going to turn it into an S-Corporation.
[382:56.35]That's what's going to happen.
[382:58.02]So, I've already talked to my CPA, financial advisor.
[383:01.88]I'm going to turn into a corporation.
[383:04.76]So, that's the best way to do it.
[383:09.27]So, but there's going to be a stream here that I don't want to be like, oh, hey, here's the Kickstarter for this cool stream.
[383:15.73]Now you know exactly what the fuck it is and exactly when it's going to happen.
[383:19.13]I'm not into that, so.
[383:23.38]I'm turning into a goddamn corporate streamer.
[383:25.60]That's right.
[383:28.31]germacorp is starting soon buying stock stealing everyone's money I mean it kind of has to be germacorp now and the jermaMustard is the logo but it's um and the thing is it might that this might not even be ran by me
[383:53.15]You know?
[383:53.41]I'm working with a couple of very close people that maybe they can manage it and I'll actually have a producer that manages the fucking money so we can actually get things on paper.
[384:08.54]But just, I mean, I'll have a huge announcement for this.
[384:11.97]But just know that that's the theory going forward.
[384:14.61]Is just have like a pool of video production money that if you feel like giving to, you can, but you don't have to.
[384:20.89]You don't even fucking need to even look at it, ever.
[384:23.69]But it'll just exist.
[384:24.75]I'm working with people that stand really close to each other, that's correct.
[384:33.08]But, yeah.
[384:35.66]That's been hard to fight that, by the way.
[384:39.02]Because for the longest time I've been trying to figure out, like, Patreon, people have to pay you every month.
[384:44.71]And some people would pay a lot of money a month.
[384:47.03]And I wouldn't want to disappoint those people if, you know, I've been giving you hundreds of dollars a month on Patreon.
[384:54.81]Any updates?
[384:55.55]What are you doing?
[384:56.61]Any streams coming?
[384:58.71]Because you have to go towards deadlines and Kickstarter has, you know, Oh, what's the Kickstarter project?
[385:02.74]I'm going to give you a thousand dollars, Jeremy.
[385:05.78]I'd rather it be an open pool.
[385:09.45]that it doesn't have to be, it could be for anything stream and YouTube related.
[385:15.78]Right?
[385:21.16]But you'll see what I'm talking about soon.
[385:25.46]Because there's a stream upcoming that's exactly what I've been talking about for the last, like for the last fucking year.
[385:34.77]This is exactly what I've been talking about for the longest time.
[385:37.69]It's actually going to... It's real.
[385:40.03]It's actually going to be a stream.
[385:41.55]And it will be within the next 30 days.
[385:44.59]And holy shit is it going to be... I cannot fucking wait.
[385:48.93]I cannot wait.
[385:52.22]And if it's worth it, then maybe we can set something like that up.
[385:56.84]We'll see.
[385:59.51]anyways this is a serious sam video yeah let's uh there's only maybe like five or ten more uh bits Jerma multi-level marketing campaign what the are you talking about anywho thank you so much topac for bringing that up I was able to address it but
[386:25.16]Yes.
[386:26.26]But one last thing I will say, remember, those of you that wanted me to open like a PayPal, a personal PayPal for you to pay to my like bank account, this is not going to be that.
[386:37.68]This will be a way for people to contribute to videos and streams only.
[386:42.35]So if you're looking for something like that, I don't have any plans for that at the moment.
[386:46.63]But, you know, if you want to give money to that business, then absolutely you can.
[386:54.73]Turning it into a pyramid scheme.
[386:56.43]No, a pyramid scheme means that like you guys all have to pay and then you have to get other people to pay and then those people have to pay.
[387:04.56]Upselling memes.
[387:07.92]No, it's just gonna be a money bucket that is used for videos.
[387:16.41]Thank you, Garfield, the Monday Killer, for the 25 cents.
[387:18.33]Good news, Jerma.
[387:19.39]Garfalot got himself some pills to help his throat.
[387:22.17]Hopefully I'll be able to do the musicals without a hitch.
[387:24.39]I'm playing Papyrus in the Undertale musical, although John says I'm more of a Sans.
[387:29.22]That's an Undertale joke.
[387:30.22]In all seriousness, I wouldn't have got into voice acting without my old pal Jerma there to inspire me.
[387:35.22]You taught me all the TF2 video voices, which spread over to SpongeBob, Family Guy, and Rick and Morty.
[387:40.66]It shocked me a guy so humble and talented can exist.
[387:44.22]Thank you, Garfield.
[387:44.92]Appreciate it, man.
[387:47.99]Uh, Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[387:49.47]Hey, Jerma, I want you to know that you really helped me out this year.
[387:52.95]This year was really rough.
[387:55.12]I had a really rough start.
[387:55.98]My mother was in the hospital, and I caught the flu and was in a constant pain from it.
[388:00.18]Every time I swallowed, it felt like I had a knife in my throat.
[388:02.48]Jesus.
[388:03.96]I was absolutely miserable, but I watched your streams and old videos to help me out.
[388:07.24]This was back in February, and thankfully, everything was okay in a few weeks.
[388:10.46]All is good now.
[388:12.44]Well, I'm glad to hear that your mother, hopefully, is doing fine.
[388:18.79]And you're doing good, too, so that's good to hear.
[388:22.55]That sounds like hell.
[388:26.01]So, thankfully, everything is good.
[388:28.79]That's good news.
[388:31.57]But, yeah.
[388:32.61]We just hang out here, man.
[388:34.77]Much love to you.
[388:37.34]Take care of yourself, you know?
[388:39.52]And thank you for the $1, too.
[388:41.82]Sorry to hear about all that shit.
[388:44.62]BitSlave, thanks for the 25 cents.
[388:46.51]Jerma Community, best community.
[388:48.91]Thank you.
[388:49.61]I would agree.
[388:50.61]I think we got a pretty good thing here.
[388:53.47]TechnoToast, thanks for the 25 cents.
[388:54.89]Garfield, more like Glarkfield.
[388:59.30]Oh, okay.
[388:59.88]Yeah, I get you.
[389:00.91]That works.
[389:02.07]It's pretty good.
[389:03.59]Hey, Butterfingers, thanks for the 25 cents.
[389:05.05]You joke about answering to a LARPing Garfield, but that long distance thing is actually pretty relevant to a best friend of mine and I going through some tough times, so thanks.
[389:13.71]Well, I'm glad... Yeah, I'm glad that... I mean, that was real advice.
[389:19.33]That was, I mean, obviously I was answering a fucking fake cartoon dinosaur.
[389:23.79]No, that's Gar... A cat.
[389:26.07]Fake cartoon cat.
[389:28.75]the advice stays the same that's really just try to go somewhere with the people that you you know have tried want to at least keep a connection with over the years go do something because then it can be less look sometimes it can be awkward when you meet up with another friend I feel the dinosaur
[389:47.08]When you meet up with somebody you haven't seen in like two or three years, potentially, it can be weird at first.
[389:51.42]You know, you've got to gauge them.
[389:55.41]Can I still use the same mannerisms?
[389:57.17]Can I still make the same jokes?
[389:58.65]Can I still talk the same way?
[390:00.19]Are they different?
[390:00.95]Have I changed?
[390:01.67]Do they think I've changed?
[390:03.27]So going and actually doing something alleviates the re-friend pressure.
[390:10.76]let's go to the water park oh yeah sick we can like slowly remember that we both like each other without having to be you know come over my house and let's drink tea and stare at each other it's a lot easier that way but uh thanks a lot butterfingers appreciate it wish you luck joker goat thanks for the 25 cents I'm about to go eat some delicious ice cream but here is how fast you were pressing your button this legitimately had me PogChamp in real life
[390:47.98]Oh, yeah.
[390:49.36]I mean, I hold the record, man.
[390:50.54]I hold some pretty significant records.
[390:54.34]I'm in the top 1,000 of how fast I can press a button.
[391:01.64]One of my only talents.
[391:05.36]Thanks, though.
[391:07.36]Thank you, JokerGoat, again, for the 25 cents.
[391:10.80]I think you double spent here.
[391:13.92]But thank you.
[391:15.22]Appreciate the 50 cents, dude.
[391:17.66]Boprip, thanks for the $1.70.
[391:19.60]Louder screams, louder bits.
[391:21.18]Keep it up.
[391:24.13]Broluck, thanks for the $1.00.
[391:25.03]Are we still going to get jermaSnort?
[391:26.77]Please, yes.
[391:28.37]Yes, you will.
[391:28.89]I promise.
[391:30.73]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.02.
[391:32.31]Delete one part of the Jupiter for one stream and don't say anything.
[391:34.92]We caught that already.
[391:35.90]We'll put a winky face.
[391:37.36]Thank you, Moo.
[391:40.64]And then only like three or four more.
[391:42.04]Butterfingers for 25 cents.
[391:42.84]You gotta say I love your integrity.
[391:44.14]You stick out as a genuine entertainer compared to most streamers.
[391:47.40]And you do things with this platform I haven't really seen people do.
[391:50.56]It's awesome.
[391:52.80]Thank you, Butterfingers.
[391:55.10]That's the theory.
[391:57.50]Is... I've talked to a few people about it.
[392:02.29]And it's one thing to like make... Let's make a YouTube video.
[392:05.25]Like I used to.
[392:06.11]Or... I'm gonna stream a game.
[392:08.91]And play.
[392:09.29]And that's fine too.
[392:11.09]But I would like to try to do something that has not been done on the platform.
[392:15.35]I'd like to try, at least, to keep going.
[392:20.67]Because I've said this before in videos and commentaries from five, six, seven years ago.
[392:25.33]If I don't stay interested, I'll stop.
[392:28.41]And to be perfectly, painfully, bluntingly obvious and not transparent, it's not...
[392:42.14]I need to do something like what we're talking about here.
[392:45.65]Playing video games is not super, super focus for me right now.
[392:51.51]That's not really what I care about right now.
[392:57.12]And if I don't do something that I genuinely, genuinely am super, super duper interested in, I'll stop.
[393:02.98]And that's just the, that's, that's it.
[393:06.03]That's the end of story.
[393:10.37]You know?
[393:11.53]I told myself that a long time ago.
[393:12.84]If I wasn't enjoying it still, if I didn't like it, if I wasn't having fun every time, then I don't want to do it.
[393:19.92]I don't give a fuck how much money I could make.
[393:21.48]I don't care about... I don't give a shit.
[393:23.39]You know what I'm saying?
[393:29.09]Do I see myself quitting game streams?
[393:31.45]No.
[393:33.07]I don't think so.
[393:36.88]I wouldn't imagine I would want to stop unless like there was a reason why and then something else was happening maybe like some something comes up and I want to continue to pursue some of the other stuff I want to do I don't give a fuck no when I say that I'm talking about there are ways to make money that I don't I don't care about
[394:05.54]That's not the first thing I think about when I turn on a stream.
[394:07.94]That's not the first thing I think about when I try to come up with something to do.
[394:14.33]And it can be to my detriment, too.
[394:16.05]It can be to my own... fault.
[394:24.25]But video game content is not the focus.
[394:31.18]It's something that I love to do, and I'm going to continue to do it because I'm still having fun doing it.
[394:34.22]Like, look at the last couple of streams.
[394:35.56]Like, this has been a ton of fun.
[394:38.64]There's a lot of new games coming out that I'm really into.
[394:40.70]But remember, I'm also getting older, too.
[394:43.00]That's another thing that a lot of people, I think, forget.
[394:46.42]Is I am getting older, and I do want to try to do things I've never done before.
[394:50.79]You know, how much more time, how much, like, more finite time do I have, like, another 10, 20 years or so, where I could have looked back when I'm 50 and been like, you know, I really wanted to do a bunch of video shit and a bunch of, like, interesting stream stuff, but I just, like, played Mario again.
[395:07.18]You know what I mean?
[395:07.64]Like, I don't want to look back and be like, fuck, I had an opportunity.
[395:10.23]I want to do it.
[395:12.73]And I didn't take it, so.
[395:18.41]If that makes sense, I hope I'm making sense here.
[395:27.01]No, I'm not that old.
[395:29.33]I'm just saying I'm getting to an age where I want to pursue things that I've always wanted to do.
[395:38.53]He's already senile.
[395:45.98]The dinner stream was... We can only go... Just stay tuned.
[395:52.72]He's having a goddamn crisis.
[395:55.95]Better to try and fail than never to try at all.
[395:57.87]I mean, there's a lot of truth to that.
[396:00.29]And we're getting real here.
[396:01.49]We're talking just real talk.
[396:02.65]This is not like fucking around or anything.
[396:09.14]I would be so angry with myself if 20 years from now I could look back and be and say like I just said.
[396:15.26]I had an opportunity to do something I've always wanted to do.
[396:19.08]And I kind of just didn't.
[396:22.12]So, that's the theory.
[396:23.73]Hopefully it makes sense.
[396:24.77]And hopefully it will make sense in a few weeks.
[396:28.53]We'll talk about it again afterwards, I'm sure.
[396:31.23]But I love all of you.
[396:32.15]You've all been fucking fantastic to me.
[396:36.52]Hey.
[396:37.54]And get ready for some fucking video games on Saturday.
[396:42.28]Everyone thinks I'm like quitting video games.
[396:49.12]No.
[396:50.16]I don't think I ever will.
[396:51.82]Too addicted.
[396:54.41]But anyways, thank you to... Broluck for the $1.
[396:59.96]Now that Mustard has passed, when are we going to get this?
[397:05.54]jermaSnort.
[397:09.86]What is that?
[397:10.68]Huh?
[397:11.40]What does snort... What does that mean?
[397:12.73]What does that convey?
[397:15.03]Bad joke?
[397:17.45]Not funny?
[397:17.95]I guess.
[397:20.29]Annoying?
[397:22.93]You know it's true.
[397:25.61]You gotta find really selective ways to make that happen on stream.
[397:29.29]I actually, I applaud that.
[397:34.11]And to wrap it up, we only got about a few more to do.
[397:38.67]Uh, Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[397:40.81]Thank you, Garfield.
[397:41.37]Fucking great.
[397:41.97]Put that in one of your three panels.
[397:57.73]you dude thank you process pro star for the 25 cents watch the third garfield movie on stream no they said 3d never mind no metal sand thanks for 25 cents no watch click on stream what I don't know convo breaker thanks for the 25 cents whoa who's like disgusting faces jermaPluto by the way that's fine that's my face
[398:21.97]Garfield, the Monday killer of 25 cents.
[398:23.70]An imagination is a powerful tool.
[398:25.68]It can tint memories of the past, shade perceptions of the present, or paint a future so vivid that it can entice or terrify.
[398:32.68]Garfield is saying this, by the way.
[398:34.34]All depending upon how we conduct ourselves today.
[398:37.45]Jim Davis.
[398:38.15]I probably should have sent that in the last sentence of bits, but I guess I had a bad case of the Mondays.
[398:44.17]Thank you, Captain Fordo, for the 25 cents.
[398:46.11]What's the next game after the detective stream?
[398:51.56]That's a good question.
[398:54.53]We actually might move to Dreamcast.
[398:59.25]Unless something new came out.
[399:00.53]Did anything new come out?
[399:04.43]If nothing new has come out that's worth really playing on stream, then we'll go to Dreamcast.
[399:12.49]Some of the good ones.
[399:14.65]We'll see.
[399:15.25]I haven't made a final decision yet.
[399:18.27]uh bit slave thanks to the one dollar I just had to buy more bits to tell you that I had the same thought before I wanted to join the air force I dropped out of university because I had no drive with the majors they had I was basically uh n e e t for about two years when I knew that I had to do something more with my life do you do what you want in life Jerma and we will all be here to support you
[399:44.06]That's true.
[399:44.56]Thank you, Bitslave.
[399:45.20]Yeah, that's true.
[399:46.34]Thank you.
[399:46.86]That actually is good advice.
[399:53.05]I'm of the opinion, and maybe people might not agree with it, but I'm of the opinion if you are not constantly challenging yourself, then what's the point?
[400:06.18]I don't like being comfortable in the things that I do.
[400:11.26]I don't like it when, you know, three, four, five, six weeks will go by and it's like, yeah, it's just whatever.
[400:16.77]I'm just comfortable.
[400:18.11]No, I want to be, like, uncomfortable.
[400:19.23]I want to be, like, moving around.
[400:19.99]I want a new shit to happen.
[400:21.05]I want to see something new.
[400:22.29]I can't help it.
[400:22.99]I have to.
[400:26.79]Constantly, constantly challenge yourself.
[400:31.89]If you start to get comfortable, it's time for another challenge.
[400:40.97]Still won't go on the official podcast.
[400:44.57]Maybe I'll say this on the official podcast.
[400:49.44]Failure is growth.
[400:51.60]Yes, it is.
[400:56.38]Learn something new every day.
[400:59.48]You know, that's a shit thing to say.
[401:03.28]Honestly, let me, like, retract that.
[401:06.10]Learn something new.
[401:07.52]Learn something new every day, man.
[401:08.94]Like, I've said that before.
[401:09.92]Shut up, idiot.
[401:10.64]Like, sometimes I want to just sit on the couch and watch fucking anime.
[401:14.57]You know what I mean?
[401:16.67]Learn something new.
[401:17.29]That's not true.
[401:19.43]Sometimes I want to just eat a tub of ice cream and go to bed.
[401:22.39]And that's it.
[401:22.73]That was my day.
[401:24.39]I didn't learn anything new.
[401:32.58]I don't even fucking watch anime.
[401:35.78]I really don't.
[401:37.70]Don't learn things, guys.
[401:42.59]That's why I said sometimes.
[401:44.55]I told you once a year.
[401:46.91]I get one anime a year.
[401:50.26]I watch an animated Japanese animated television program start to finish one time a year.
[401:58.90]And I've already done it.
[402:00.79]I've already done it it's already been done this year can't go no wait that was 2017 fuck okay I gotta get a new one last year's was my hero academia and whoa that one sucks I'm just fucking kidding I liked it all my like almighty's he's cool
[402:27.45]I really am kidding.
[402:29.05]It was an enjoyable show.
[402:30.47]The whole second season was not worth watching.
[402:34.51]By the way, can we talk about this?
[402:36.05]I'm going to make somebody mad here.
[402:39.61]Why do animes continue to put in tournament arcs into their shows and their mangas?
[402:51.98]I don't want to watch the kids have a tourney
[402:57.57]I want to see the villains.
[402:58.79]I want to see the conflict.
[403:00.69]I don't want to watch nine episodes in a row of people in a friendly competition.
[403:13.57]Because people love power levels.
[403:21.11]No, give me conflict.
[403:22.77]Give me passion.
[403:24.85]Give me rage.
[403:30.94]tourney arcs are good tourney but they I'm not look I'm not going to argue that they're not an interesting watch I don't hate the shows that have them in them I just want to just pull the fast forward button down whenever it's like whatever I see on the TV it's like oh hey that was crazy we just bested those villains and I'm getting stronger every day
[403:51.80]Oh, hey, how about we do a huge tournament between all the students?
[403:59.38]It's like, no!
[404:02.82]Fast forward!
[404:06.14]I just, I hate it.
[404:12.85]Jerm is channeling his best anime.
[404:17.49]JoJo's Bizarre Adventure does not have any tournaments.
[404:20.59]Hmm.
[404:26.78]But the thing is, they all happen the same way.
[404:31.16]If there was a tournament arc where some things didn't happen the way you thought it was going to be, the main character that's not that good, that's still learning, that's still trying as hard as they can, is going to get bested by the one that's kind of a dick, that's always really good, and then the side character that is also kind of strong is going to come out and this is their introduction.
[404:54.07]The main character doesn't fucking win.
[404:56.77]But he learned a few things, and he got really far.
[405:00.29]Why can't there be a tournament arc where, in the middle of the tournament, the fucking villains break through, and like, like, holy shit, that guy just got a knife tentacle through his chest.
[405:12.44]And that character's dead.
[405:14.68]Wow.
[405:20.92]Where's that?
[405:21.36]Because that would blow my mind.
[405:27.01]Dragon Ball did that.
[405:30.88]Did they?
[405:33.96]They actually do that.
[405:37.12]That did happen.
[405:37.92]Okay.
[405:41.48]What's animated?
[405:42.65]Now I don't want to watch that.
[405:46.79]You just said there was a show that did that.
[405:48.33]Now I know it's going to happen, so I'm not going to like it.
[405:51.61]Anyways.
[405:55.29]Thank you to Captain Fordo for the 25 cents.
[405:57.63]Also, where can I get this on PC?
[405:58.85]You can't find it anything.
[406:00.75]You have to buy it on Amazon.
[406:02.15]Either Amazon is your only option, or... You didn't hear it from me.
[406:13.67]But I've heard that there are various websites that exist that have potential...
[406:23.01]somebody told me this and I didn't when they told me this I fucking stopped him I was like excuse me don't fucking tell me that you're don't tell me that there are websites where you can download the ISO for this game and then you can mount the CD and then you install it from that CD don't you dare how dare you say something like that to me and then he turned around I got really upset at him for this this happened like last week you know
[406:59.47]Hey, Convo Breaker, thanks for the 25 cents.
[407:02.49]Make it Overlord for this year or JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[407:06.03]I'm just going to end up watching it.
[407:08.95]Why not?
[407:10.59]Hey, MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[407:11.91]Just wanted to throw the one last buck your way to say that I appreciate these streams and this community and the way you can make us laugh at stupid shit.
[407:18.34]This keeps me going sometimes.
[407:19.62]Love y'all.
[407:21.66]Thank you, Moo.
[407:25.70]We all love you back.
[407:29.09]On subbing you criminal.
[407:31.31]No, you either have to get it on PlayStation 2, on PC, or do not even say it again.
[407:39.73]I can see you over there.
[407:41.07]I can see what you're saying.
[407:42.79]Download the ISO from a website and mount it and then install that and get the no CD patch?
[407:49.28]Get the fuck out of here.
[407:50.64]Don't even look at me again.
[407:51.60]I don't want to see you over here again.
[407:54.44]Get up!
[407:55.22]I'll fucking get you.
[408:05.47]I'm gonna delete this VOD.
[408:07.99]Good cop.
[408:10.73]Hey, Mr. Mmeetveed.
[408:13.48]Thanks for the $5.
[408:16.14]Hey, just want to say my birthday was today and I'm really glad I found your stream.
[408:18.68]Funniest stuff I've seen on Twitch.
[408:20.00]Hey, well, happy birthday.
[408:23.13]Welcome to the family.
[408:26.63]Thanks, dude.
[408:28.25]Hope you have a good birthday.
[408:35.23]Hope you get some good presents.
[408:37.91]Bug Robbie, thanks for the $2.75.
[408:39.83]Real talk, I just finished Devilman Crybaby about a week ago.
[408:42.94]It was really good and I barely watch anime.
[408:44.48]That's a real show.
[408:46.66]Devilman Crybaby.
[408:51.30]That's an odd name for a television show.
[408:56.66]Alright.
[408:58.12]Well, maybe I'll look at it.
[409:00.90]Uh... Sinil or Sinil... Sinil...
[409:06.64]Sinal.
[409:07.14]Thanks for the $1.
[409:07.91]I just got here and I'm really drunk, but this is my first time donating and I love all your content.
[409:11.31]Hey, thanks, dude.
[409:14.75]Hey, make sure, uh... Water.
[409:18.87]Drink a good helping of water before you go to sleep tonight.
[409:22.61]And... Listen to some tunes, you know what I mean?
[409:25.01]Like, put on some tunes and just relax.
[409:30.02]But hey, thanks for catching the stream.
[409:34.64]And...
[409:36.18]That's going to wrap it up.
[409:39.60]How about no?
[409:40.28]What do you mean, how about no?
[409:43.84]What do you mean, how about no?
[409:45.48]Talking about drinking water?
[409:48.04]When you're really drunk?
[409:48.94]That's good advice.
[409:57.67]See you guys Saturday.
[409:59.45]Have a good one.
[410:00.71]Take care.
[410:02.57]See you soon.
[410:08.27]DetectiveStream, prepare yourselves.
[410:10.42]Get your accusations ready.
[410:13.00]Saturday afternoon.
[410:13.72]No stream tomorrow.
[410:15.19]Keep that in mind.
[410:17.35]Take care.
