[ve:60.16.100]

[00:12.45]I'm strapped in.
[00:14.53]I can't get out now.
[00:16.59]My arms are tied to the chairs.
[00:19.21]My back is tied to the back of the chair, and I have to beat Sekiro today.
[00:24.84]No.
[00:26.98]Welcome, guys.
[00:31.41]strapped.
[00:31.99]He's strapped in alright.
[00:36.59]I'll be right back.
[00:39.01]I forgot one thing.
[00:41.61]A tweet.
[00:42.93]And a coffee.
[00:46.45]See you in a sec.
[01:27.14]What, I got an LOL title?
[01:29.58]What's wrong with an LOL title every now and then?
[01:37.64]This is the worst thing- Okay, I'm gonna give you some insight.
[01:40.94]On, uh... On streamer insight, okay?
[01:44.57]So, I just... I had to grab, like, two things.
[01:47.65]So I had to go up the stairs.
[01:50.81]Down the stairs.
[01:52.87]Auto, you good?
[01:53.55]Okay, auto's been out.
[01:54.35]Back up the stairs.
[01:56.68]And then I just sat here and I forgot that I'm like... Hey, guys.
[02:01.12]How are you?
[02:01.62]Hey, welcome to the broadcast.
[02:09.22]But, yeah.
[02:10.58]Somebody said, wouldn't you have finished any Dark Souls by now?
[02:13.37]Dark Souls 3 took me like four or five streams, didn't it?
[02:16.95]And this game is harder than Dark Souls.
[02:20.19]In my opinion.
[02:21.03]I think it's more difficult than any of the Dark Souls games.
[02:30.44]Somebody said, no, you're bad.
[02:31.88]I beat Owl first try.
[02:33.64]And I beat Double Gorilla first try.
[02:36.38]But I'm terrible at the game, though.
[02:38.05]You know, just awful.
[02:39.07]I mean, he's just terrible at this game.
[02:41.63]Everything about Ace is terrible at the game.
[02:49.49]I mean, he's just so bad.
[02:51.49]I can't even understand how awful he is.
[03:00.46]The double gorilla where you fight two gorillas at the same time and one of them has no- and he beat it first try.
[03:04.46]I mean, he's so awful at games like this.
[03:06.56]I just can't- I can't even watch him.
[03:14.94]Yeah, give it a rest.
[03:27.98]Never.
[03:40.29]No, I, uh, I just... If you're just joining us for the first time and you haven't seen Sekiro ever... Uh, I'm gonna tell you just... I'm gonna leave now.
[03:50.59]Because we're gonna talk about major things that just happened.
[03:57.61]Okay, I... Are you here?
[03:59.35]We all good?
[04:02.12]Alright.
[04:03.28]Uh, so, I... That was your chance.
[04:05.40]I just killed my dad.
[04:08.51]in this room, but literally the last thing I did last night.
[04:15.55]I don't know what happens next.
[04:21.45]All I know is that people were in this room, right?
[04:29.14]Yes.
[04:29.84]Okay.
[04:30.26]So, I think I gotta come down here.
[04:35.06]I'm glad you've come, Master Wolf.
[04:39.38]I don't have any seeds, right?
[04:41.62]Shit.
[04:44.84]Well, I just made a choice to protect him, right?
[04:46.94]This is the tree branch.
[05:11.61]Yeah, I killed my father for a stick.
[05:25.88]Yeah, I could have just gone outside to any tree out there.
[05:29.56]I could have just, okay, I could have like sneezed over here and he was like, what was that?
[05:32.98]Could have walked over here, grabbed a branch from here, just snapped it off and been like, here it is.
[05:38.37]And he would have been like, oh, thanks.
[05:41.44]What's so special about that branch?
[05:45.88]We don't have all the ingredients?
[05:48.28]It is the mortal blade.
[05:49.81]The sword that can kill those who cannot die.
[05:53.33]Yes, it was given to me by the divine child of the rejuvenating waters.
[05:58.41]Do we have all the ingredients?
[05:59.69]The divine child of the rejuvenating waters?
[06:02.71]The monks at Senpou Temple abandoned the ways of their faith in pursuit of immortality.
[06:07.85]The result is those who have false dragon's heritage, known as the divine children of the rejuvenating waters.
[06:14.95]A false dragon's heritage.
[06:18.31]Okay.
[06:46.86]Well, you didn't really give me any more info.
[06:51.72]I didn't really look at... Let me, like, look at the items, too.
[06:55.53]Because I got, like, two new things, right?
[07:01.51]Didn't I get, like, something to read?
[07:02.67]I'm trying to think of what the last thing we did was.
[07:06.95]What the last piece of information here was.
[07:11.01]Oh.
[07:14.00]Oh.
[07:16.72]What about you?
[07:17.14]You got anything for me?
[07:17.78]Oh, right, right, right.
[07:21.55]I was gonna kill the tutorial guy.
[07:25.25]Right.
[07:26.05]I was gonna go kill Mr. Tutorial.
[07:48.41]I could clear the essence as well.
[07:56.71]See, he's ready.
[07:57.23]I can finally die.
[08:01.14]My shame for not following my master into death.
[08:03.78]I can finally... You're certain of this?
[08:08.08]Yes.
[08:09.56]I want you to kill me as you wish.
[08:12.14]Go on.
[08:13.58]Do it.
[08:17.54]How do I do it?
[08:18.80]Can I do it any way I want?
[08:20.81]Like, can I get up there and drop a piano on him?
[08:23.87]Oh, no, he has to die by this sword, right?
[08:31.73]Whoa!
[08:32.15]There's a centipede inside of him!
[08:36.82]What?
[08:38.54]Oh, why the fuck does he have that inside of his body?
[08:43.96]What did he... Ugh.
[08:50.44]A false tooth loaded with a secret shinobi drug blue in color can be used repeatedly.
[08:55.90]Crush the blue nostrum between the back teeth to die as often as one pleases.
[09:03.88]What?
[09:04.14]Alright, I'm just figuring out, people that can't die have the centipede worm inside them.
[09:14.80]That's fucked up.
[09:16.80]Yeah, that's a cyanide tooth.
[09:19.59]That's like some CIA shit.
[09:25.19]Wait, do I have one of those inside of me?
[09:26.67]I probably do.
[09:31.17]Imagine figuring that out.
[09:33.43]Imagine seeing that that's what makes people stay alive forever.
[09:39.90]I would be like, I want to get a CT scan.
[09:42.20]Don't kill me yet, but just like... I just want to know if it's in there.
[09:52.48]Well, that was... I got the tooth.
[09:55.36]How much money do I have?
[09:57.22]360.
[09:57.32]I can't breathe.
[10:03.58]Alright, I gotta... I'm gonna cleanse the dragon rot.
[10:06.98]Let's just do it now.
[10:21.28]Everyone's been healed.
[10:27.29]Alright, clean slate.
[10:29.23]Good to go.
[10:30.17]Hey, I'm fine.
[10:33.35]Now, I want to... I mean, he's got two of these, so I can always have at least one.
[10:44.95]What about pellets?
[10:45.59]Maybe I should just buy a shitload of pellets.
[10:50.17]How many do I have?
[10:53.31]No, I have 24 of these.
[10:56.43]When did I get so many pellets?
[10:57.71]I don't even remember getting this many.
[11:01.59]When did I get... Oh yeah, I did go on like an item run, didn't I?
[11:07.34]Are you going to try to kill Headless today?
[11:10.10]I don't even want to hear that name.
[11:13.14]I don't even want to know that character exists.
[11:15.52]It'll automatically make me upset.
[11:20.86]In fact, I'm already mad now.
[11:22.64]I don't even want to think about it.
[11:25.31]I'm going to say we'll see.
[11:34.26]I'm just preparing, I'm just getting, make sure I'm ready to play, because we got this, we're in like the last, we're in like the final act of the game, I think.
[11:42.66]From what happened last night, this has to be the final act.
[11:51.78]I still need, okay, where can I, where can I get?
[11:53.95]Let me see, sparkling, long spark.
[12:01.99]Long spark and increased proportion of blackout for the effect can be prolonged in the average fire.
[12:05.90]I like the firecrackers.
[12:07.02]Purple fume spark.
[12:14.40]Oh, shit.
[12:16.17]I want this so bad.
[12:20.95]Oh, man.
[12:21.43]I want this right now.
[12:23.37]How do I get this right now?
[12:28.72]That's a lot of money.
[12:30.48]I'm gonna... How much money do I have?
[12:31.76]Do I have any things?
[12:32.34]I don't think I have any of those pouches, do I?
[12:38.42]I do.
[12:39.06]Yeah, I have to... I'm buying it.
[12:40.50]What was it?
[12:44.14]Six?
[12:49.08]I use the firecrackers so much.
[12:50.58]It's like my favorite item.
[12:52.50]I might as well just do it if that's the thing I'm gonna use.
[13:01.36]Because I have the materials to go from here to here.
[13:03.48]I need two.
[13:11.34]Okay, let's just start it.
[13:16.46]What does this one do?
[13:19.71]Forcing enemies caught in the blast.
[13:20.75]Turn around.
[13:21.33]Oh, this is the one that makes him turn around.
[13:22.55]Okay, I can do it twice.
[13:24.03]And then that leads me to here.
[13:33.64]Oh my god, dude, do I have to go?
[13:35.43]Do I have to get this?
[13:39.31]As well?
[13:41.11]Shit, this really is Monster Hunter.
[13:46.26]God damn it.
[13:47.42]I have to get all these?
[13:48.64]Oh no!
[13:51.86]Alright, well, I have to get this.
[13:53.24]Ah!
[14:05.79]I need more money.
[14:13.73]What was it?
[14:14.11]I didn't see it.
[14:15.63]I think it was like 500 or 600.
[14:26.55]Just get more money.
[14:27.45]Well, at least I'm upgrading these.
[14:29.93]Okay.
[14:31.91]Then that gives this to me.
[14:33.13]I need 600 more, which leads to here.
[14:38.61]This is improve Sabumaru.
[14:40.95]So let's just get... I have a little bit more money.
[14:42.81]Let's do it.
[14:50.68]Two, three, four, five.
[14:52.20]God damn it.
[15:05.41]Hold on.
[15:13.25]Play a different game?
[15:14.31]No, come on.
[15:15.95]You want me to stop now?
[15:16.83]Imagine stopping now.
[15:22.81]Alright, how am I going to sell, like, fucking four of these?
[15:30.67]Imagine playing this game to this point and then being like, well, that was fun.
[15:36.47]First impressions, it's really hard.
[15:37.99]It's really good.
[15:40.14]That's it.
[15:41.70]I'll see you next time.
[15:42.56]Okay, so this brings me down here.
[15:47.45]Okay.
[15:57.85]All right, okay.
[15:59.07]I am now ready to go in a straight line now.
[16:04.07]So I have improved stuff.
[16:06.70]Another time that up.
[16:10.46]That's what you do with most games you stream?
[16:11.98]Well, if a game has... I mean, it really depends.
[16:17.53]Right?
[16:18.59]Okay, first, like a game like Kenshi, right?
[16:20.19]That's like a 200-hour game.
[16:22.67]Right?
[16:22.83]I'm not gonna play that, like, 30 streams in a row.
[16:28.12]A game like Resident Evil 2, I'll play through the whole thing.
[16:30.28]It's like a one-and-done kind of experience.
[16:32.48]A game like this, it's just all the way through, one-and-done.
[16:39.71]Games that require potentially 10 to 20 streams to even get to the meat and potato of the game.
[16:50.34]It's a lot different.
[16:51.16]Okay, so I have some better stuff.
[16:54.06]Let's see.
[16:55.04]That's already there.
[17:19.42]Okay.
[17:21.44]I think I'm ready to go.
[17:23.38]Uh, that was 50 bucks just came in right now.
[17:27.04]Who just gave $50?
[17:27.56]It was Fitty!
[17:36.10]Thank you so much, Fitty, for the $50.
[17:37.60]Uh... Hey, money!
[17:41.95]They said, also, just so you know, your chat's being monitored and recorded 24-7.
[17:44.35]This is the internet.
[17:49.38]If you don't think that everything you've ever typed in this chat could be pulled up somewhere, we're in 2019, man.
[17:54.18]It's the internet.
[18:02.20]You know what?
[18:03.06]That's just the nature of where we are right now as humans.
[18:13.03]Hey, future people.
[18:14.51]Chad is just learning this.
[18:19.38]Yeah, so when you told me, like, two weeks ago to suck a fart out of your ass, somebody can just find you saying that.
[18:29.67]I just, I hope everyone's aware of this.
[18:34.53]Like, when you told chat that you ate a booger out of your nose, and you liked how it tasted, and you were like, fuck, man, that's, like, weird, but I don't know why I like that.
[18:42.42]Five years from now, someone can look at that.
[18:53.90]It's the internet, man.
[18:55.48]You gotta be careful.
[19:01.34]He just admitted it on stream.
[19:04.28]Alright, where the fuck am I going?
[19:07.46]I got... I got... Okay, I can dive.
[19:12.68]Where do I want to go?
[19:26.47]I've said some pretty dopey stuff, to be honest.
[19:29.55]Yeah, whatever, though.
[19:34.52]Was, like, your future employer gonna go to your Twitch chat log and see what you wrote?
[19:38.28]Uh, it says here that, uh, was your username shiteater106?
[19:47.18]Um, yeah.
[19:49.90]Oh, well, but what about this one?
[19:52.24]That's shiteater107, 108, 109, and 110.
[19:55.76]Those are all tied to the same IP address.
[19:58.24]Is that also you?
[20:00.40]Yep.
[20:00.98]Yeah, it is.
[20:02.46]Oh.
[20:04.06]Any reason why you made five shiteater usernames?
[20:06.63]I'm just curious.
[20:08.24]Well, you see, when I was like 18, I was in this guy Jerma985's chat, and I got banned like four times for writing, I love eating shit in his chat.
[20:20.49]And I got banned four times over the course of like six months.
[20:25.10]So I just kept making new usernames to say that again, and I would get removed again.
[20:30.50]And then finally I was removed from the whole website.
[20:33.62]And... Excuse me.
[20:37.73]What?
[20:39.05]I don't think we at Johnson & Johnson can have somebody like that around here.
[20:44.25]You gotta be careful, guys.
[20:45.17]Wolf, we've finally done it.
[20:49.95]Once we make the fountainhead incense, you can infuse your clothes with the aroma.
[20:56.18]Now, place all of the ingredients in the incense burner.
[20:59.18]We here at Johnson & Johnson baby tear-free shampoo formula company 107
[21:07.35]100 through 106 got banned because we were putting formaldehyde in baby shampoo.
[21:13.28]We got banned five times as a company.
[21:23.50]Let's go.
[21:28.67]My lord.
[21:33.37]You know too much.
[21:39.34]What if I just, like, fucking started slashing him?
[21:42.62]Yes, my lord.
[21:45.52]Use your eyes?
[21:46.16]Is that what he just said?
[21:52.15]It's over now, Wolf.
[21:55.35]Use your eyes.
[21:56.07]I'm fine.
[21:58.16]I just made a small cut on my chest.
[22:01.96]So this is the Fountainhead Incense.
[22:07.12]It's so extraordinarily nostalgic.
[22:12.29]Yeah, like the new Ghostbusters movie, Ghostbusters 3 coming up.
[22:16.78]Roma and Fountainhead Palace.
[22:20.37]Those words have been burned into my mind.
[22:23.55]Fountainhead Palace.
[22:25.27]It's just as Lord Takeru wrote.
[22:29.08]That place must lead to the divine realm.
[22:31.84]But how can the Fountainhead Palace be reached?
[22:35.10]A sweetly scented bridal offering.
[22:37.84]That was written on the altar where the fragrant stone was placed.
[22:41.41]Yes.
[22:42.47]You now carry the aroma of the Fountainhead incense.
[22:46.33]I believe the path leading to the Fountainhead Palace will open before you if you go to the shrine within the cave.
[22:53.64]Immortality shall soon be severed.
[22:56.44]A shrine in the cave.
[22:58.16]As you wish.
[23:00.22]So, the shrine... Where was that?
[23:02.32]Am I drinking?
[23:08.41]No.
[23:09.79]I got a coffee here.
[23:12.52]All right, so that was... Which one?
[23:16.72]I see a cave.
[23:17.62]What was it?
[23:18.02]Cave.
[23:18.98]I forget where it was.
[23:20.60]Was that the misty place?
[23:21.64]That was here somewhere.
[23:33.57]Wedding cave door.
[23:36.05]I think.
[23:36.57]I think.
[23:44.28]Somebody wrote, egg.
[23:47.53]Mod that guy for like 30 seconds.
[23:49.57]All right.
[23:55.91]I think this is obviously the place.
[24:00.67]So go in this cave.
[24:01.89]And now I smell like I have a certain scent to me.
[24:05.47]So now I'll be able to open the secret door.
[24:13.90]Maybe.
[24:14.60]No.
[24:17.10]Shelter stones?
[24:17.76]Is this where... Okay.
[24:18.88]Do I have to get on this?
[24:31.03]Or do I maybe dive?
[24:32.09]Oh, no.
[24:33.57]This is... This is just a prayer outhouse.
[24:38.69]Well, hold on.
[24:39.09]Let me dive down here.
[24:40.33]Is there enough...
[24:45.89]Is there a pool I can dive in?
[24:49.49]Is there?
[24:49.77]There has to be.
[24:50.43]Come on.
[24:50.73]This is like a standing water somewhere.
[24:55.69]Yeah, diving in puddles.
[24:56.66]If I dive in a puddle, I'll just break my teeth.
[25:03.78]No, there's no pool here.
[25:05.92]I thought maybe there'd be like a little pool back here or something.
[25:08.26]Alright, let's go.
[25:11.50]Somebody said small break.
[25:12.96]I'm gonna go in here.
[25:18.49]God.
[25:19.89]The impatience.
[25:25.08]The instant gratification.
[25:26.64]Instant gratification.
[25:28.90]I want to look around the trees.
[25:31.28]Okay?
[25:34.35]There's a big giant goat foot.
[25:43.23]I saw somebody's playing the claw game.
[25:47.50]I got it!
[25:55.65]What the hell?
[25:58.39]Okay, this just got weird.
[26:03.73]That's Mojo from Chrono Cross.
[26:08.29]Odd reference, I know, but it is.
[26:27.92]Where is he delivering me to?
[26:33.83]Well, apparently he hasn't walked in a while.
[26:37.87]I severely overestimated.
[26:39.11]I was lying down for too long.
[26:41.51]I have so much lactic acid built up.
[26:43.25]I'll just let him go here.
[26:44.21]This is fine.
[26:49.36]He ended with a dab.
[26:50.76]Oh, don't say that.
[26:58.64]Your Uber is here.
[26:59.74]Oh, you guys.
[27:07.28]Whoa, this is cool.
[27:18.15]I kind of would have liked to have traveled a little bit longer on Mr. Scarecrow.
[27:27.75]Just in case.
[27:37.08]That was fun.
[27:38.14]That's the coolest thing in the game so far.
[27:42.32]I hope he gets up when I have to fight him.
[27:43.94]Please let me fight this guy.
[27:44.97]What was it?
[27:52.33]We ended last night at an 8.6.
[27:53.45]This makes it an 8.7.
[27:53.91]Not that much.
[27:55.57]It was like 15 seconds.
[28:14.27]He's pretending.
[28:14.83]He just moved.
[28:15.29]This is pretty.
[28:18.71]Wait, items.
[28:21.31]FromSoftware always does this thing where they put an item directly to the left or directly to the right behind something.
[28:32.08]Like back here.
[28:33.16]Oh, come on.
[28:33.68]There would be one right here.
[28:34.60]If this was any other game, it would be right here.
[28:37.35]You know I'm right.
[28:40.65]Alright, well, whatever.
[28:43.37]Theory immediately debunked.
[28:45.03]It's fine.
[28:47.87]This is... Uh... Didn't I fight this guy?
[28:53.98]I fought, like, the illusion version of this guy.
[28:59.32]Okay.
[28:59.64]I... I guess we're doing this.
[29:03.27]Damn, that posture damage is fucking terrible.
[29:06.53]Oops.
[29:17.10]Oh fuck, I thought he didn't know he was going to keep going.
[29:21.96]He's got three health bars.
[29:31.11]Whoa, that hurts.
[29:44.31]I'm not fucking with that.
[29:59.18]Oh, no, no, no!
[30:07.78]Dammit, I'm getting too greedy.
[30:10.27]Alright, there's one.
[30:15.21]What's he gonna do now?
[30:19.57]Different, same.
[30:20.15]Alright, this is different.
[30:25.08]I think I'm just gonna jump up here.
[30:27.58]Whoa, he can go up.
[30:28.62]What the fuck?
[30:30.76]What?
[30:32.40]He has an extra long sword now.
[30:35.18]Okay, maybe not a good idea.
[30:59.96]Wowee!
[31:06.38]Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[31:07.62]Back, back, back, back, back.
[31:09.68]Fuck!
[31:10.06]I didn't time it right.
[31:12.44]Alright.
[31:23.25]Let's go!
[31:23.89]Let's go!
[31:27.83]I think I know what he's gonna do.
[31:31.31]Uh-oh, here comes a centipede.
[31:34.42]Is he gonna do the mist again?
[31:35.22]Ooh, that didn't work!
[31:45.20]Ooh!
[31:46.43]Okay, all right, all right, all right, slow it down.
[31:52.93]Whoa!
[31:56.87]He does a s- it's all slides.
[32:00.20]I gotta get the fuck away from him.
[32:05.76]It slashes.
[32:07.66]Alright, let's go.
[32:15.44]That's a grab?
[32:16.24]No, it's not.
[32:16.80]Is it terror?
[32:18.90]I don't fucking have any idea what that is.
[32:22.13]Curious.
[32:23.33]That's terror, isn't it?
[32:28.93]Curious.
[32:40.03]Bastard.
[32:49.46]It's not even worth blocking these.
[32:50.96]It takes too much.
[32:52.00]Woop, that's a bar.
[32:55.86]Didn't jump fast enough.
[33:01.41]You know what?
[33:01.73]Posture Candy, I think, is what I gotta use here.
[33:14.93]Damn it.
[33:15.23]That was quick.
[33:16.43]I ain't giving up yet.
[33:23.13]I ain't giving up yet.
[33:24.09]Hold on.
[33:29.25]So, what's this?
[33:29.99]Posture?
[33:30.43]I need posture.
[33:31.71]Candy.
[33:40.82]Shit.
[33:44.67]Not good.
[34:03.18]Back it up, back it up.
[34:08.00]Man.
[34:45.75]Hmm.
[34:48.25]Hmm.
[35:16.37]Don't you forget about me!
[35:30.90]That's... That's the wrong thing I equipped.
[35:36.93]That's the wrong thing.
[35:38.35]Wrong thing.
[36:25.82]Berry bush, berry bush, berry bush, berry bush!
[36:51.01]Oh, it's okay!
[36:52.49]It's okay!
[36:54.56]Fire!
[36:57.96]Fire!
[37:00.00]I bring you fire!
[37:23.22]I am the God of Hellfire and I bring you... Fire!
[37:37.53]I'm telling you, I got locked in the wall there.
[37:40.27]That was very bad.
[37:51.27]That was so scary.
[37:53.67]Without the firecrackers, I'm dead.
[37:57.93]That was a last-ditch effort to cracker him.
[38:00.69]Ugh.
[38:10.35]Dragon's Tally Board.
[38:14.38]That's an iced coffee, huh?
[38:19.30]Possessing this increases the stocks that can be purchased in merchant shops.
[38:23.59]Such a tally board is highly prized by the merchant class.
[38:26.73]Old custom dictates that those of dragon rank are recognized as supreme merchants by the Imperial Palace.
[38:34.60]So, what does that mean?
[38:36.38]That means that I can buy more, or that they just have increased stock, I guess?
[38:43.52]Interesting.
[38:49.91]That was a fun fight.
[38:53.44]The last three, they've done like, the last three fights have just been awesome.
[39:01.49]Let's get that power up.
[39:04.39]True Monk.
[39:10.57]Uh-huh.
[39:11.05]The Corrupted Monk was among the infested.
[39:13.43]Standing over the Fountainhead Palace, indeed, immortality would seem a fitting quality for Eternal Watcher of the Palace.
[39:21.04]Her true name is Priestess Yao.
[39:26.56]He hated the Guardian Ape.
[39:28.90]No, Guardian Ape was fucking cool.
[39:31.30]It was just... That secret second boss fight.
[39:37.28]It's just fucking hard as shit.
[39:42.09]Okay, attack power's been enhanced.
[39:45.63]So I have a please backseat me.
[39:47.35]This is a please backseat me chat, okay?
[39:52.24]What do these do?
[39:54.16]I feel like I've been holding onto both of these.
[39:59.54]I mean, raise in prayer between one's palms to restore a node of... Do I get to only just do this once?
[40:09.94]It just refills a resurrection node.
[40:12.38]So it doesn't add another resurrection, it just refills one.
[40:19.12]Does it consume it?
[40:21.70]If I do this, that's it.
[40:23.14]I just get to do it once.
[40:24.00]One use.
[40:25.28]One use.
[40:27.48]So let's say I was having an intense boss fight and I died, and I had the black bar down there, and I took one of those.
[40:33.66]I would be able to do it again.
[40:39.86]You could do that, yes.
[40:42.00]Exactly, yes.
[40:43.60]I don't think so.
[40:48.70]I love that.
[40:49.52]You can use it after you rez.
[40:50.76]All right.
[40:58.17]Let's rest.
[40:59.69]Dude, I... It was like two or three... When I had the poison equipped wrong, I thought that was going to throw me off.
[41:07.82]This is beautiful.
[41:11.40]Fountainhead Palace.
[41:17.79]Wait, points.
[41:23.11]Alright, I've hit five.
[41:28.01]I have that skill.
[41:30.29]I've neglected this so much.
[41:32.49]I just don't know where to go.
[41:37.59]This is going to increase it by one.
[41:38.87]I don't think it's worth it.
[41:45.81]Maybe one of these.
[41:47.21]What do these do?
[41:47.81]Shinobi eyes.
[41:48.47]Ooh.
[41:53.11]I'm fairly good at countering those.
[42:01.32]I do the Mercuri counter like 6 out of 10 times.
[42:08.76]Yeah, I'm gonna get this.
[42:17.32]So now I have run and slide.
[42:22.40]And... Oh, I gotta get this one too.
[42:26.56]No, wait, what?
[42:31.85]I do have to get this, do I?
[42:34.11]I guess so.
[42:36.69]Uh, KDKD945, thanks for the five community subs.
[42:43.19]Thank you so much.
[42:46.38]For the five subs.
[42:48.24]Uh, so, look at how close I am.
[42:49.54]That's gonna kill, like, a couple people.
[42:57.05]Alright, I'm ready.
[42:58.04]I told you I was gonna come ready to play today.
[43:00.86]Told you that.
[43:01.54]Last night, owl, gone in a fucking try.
[43:04.68]Today, let's go.
[43:05.74]I'm ready to game.
[43:11.62]I got my caramel macchiato from Starbucks.
[43:17.23]It sucks.
[43:18.33]It's really not that good, but I still have it.
[43:28.72]This thing too.
[43:32.30]Oh, another five community subs from KDK.
[43:36.82]Damn.
[43:38.68]Five more subs from KDK.
[43:41.12]Thank you.
[43:41.46]All right, let's go.
[43:44.16]Let's go.
[43:44.54]Let's game.
[43:48.45]So let's head out here.
[43:50.99]Wait, one last thing.
[43:55.19]Which one of these is the best?
[44:00.01]What's the puppeteer one?
[44:04.15]Maybe this one sounds interesting.
[44:10.64]All right.
[44:10.96]I don't know if anybody else gets like this when they play these games, but after like an intense fight that you win,
[44:25.14]I don't know why this doesn't happen when you lose.
[44:27.98]Maybe it's because your body doesn't have any time to relax.
[44:31.84]But after killing that guy, I was like this.
[44:36.44]And I need a second to just fucking relax.
[44:44.45]It doesn't happen when I lose.
[44:45.49]I think it's your body just unwinding.
[44:50.19]Because you're so wound up the whole time.
[44:57.37]I just gotta look at this.
[44:59.29]Where's the selfie camera?
[45:00.75]Just take a note from the Spider-Man, whatever.
[45:06.72]I'm too busy looking.
[45:07.66]This is beautiful.
[45:08.50]This is the part where I like, this is my favorite zone so far.
[45:15.36]I could get hurt by falling here.
[45:18.34]Oh, I guess we... That didn't even hurt.
[45:31.09]Yeah, this is lovely.
[45:32.25]Let me see.
[45:53.84]Ooh.
[45:56.23]KDK, again, is on like a five sub every 30 second interval.
[46:02.65]Thank you, KDK, again.
[46:06.15]For the five community subs.
[46:08.01]That's... Is it a dog?
[46:13.94]No, it's got like a... No, it's one of those weird alien people.
[46:37.13]He's my friend!
[46:39.79]See, I didn't kill him.
[46:40.61]I just brought him back as a close friend of mine.
[46:45.07]What do you want to do?
[46:45.64]I don't know.
[46:48.00]Finally, I have a guy.
[46:48.74]Okay, you can co-op now.
[46:49.84]This is how you do co-op in Sekiro.
[46:52.38]You have to control their minds.
[46:55.28]Oh, KDK again.
[46:59.33]KDK added again.
[47:04.05]Yeah, okay, those of you that are concerned about co-op, just get this ability.
[47:08.29]And then pretend that your friend's over.
[47:19.06]Oh, god damn it, dude, really?
[47:20.84]You got hit by the fucking arrow there, now we have to go back to the beginning?
[47:24.02]I have to reload the game.
[47:27.54]Just try not to die.
[47:29.30]From software.
[47:31.36]It's like the worst making co-op parts of video games.
[47:33.91]Like, let me go back and put my soapstone down again.
[47:38.27]God damn it.
[47:48.32]I didn't even know what that was!
[47:49.60]I don't know what happened!
[47:50.84]Fucking god damn it.
[47:51.66]Yeah, I'll see you in 22 more minutes.
[48:00.68]Uh, my game just, like, crashed.
[48:13.28]What a funny streamer.
[48:15.34]Thanks!
[48:17.52]I tried.
[48:18.10]Can we do, like, jokes and comedy here?
[48:21.00]I'll give you a routine.
[48:21.94]Ready?
[48:22.22]Like, hey, it's me.
[48:24.34]Playing on the drum.
[48:26.14]Not anymore.
[48:26.70]I got ya.
[48:28.90]Oh, my livelihood!
[48:30.03]Another five subs from Katie.
[48:40.27]Are you gonna do this, like, the whole time?
[48:42.75]Five more subs from Katie K. This is gonna keep going.
[48:51.56]This guy's 43, not even close.
[48:53.28]I kind of just want to look around.
[48:57.94]I like this place.
[49:04.26]He's 60.
[49:05.05]I sound 60.
[49:07.03]At the moment.
[49:12.29]Um... Well, there's a guy over here.
[49:15.91]This place is huge!
[49:19.92]Ooh.
[49:23.44]Alright, let me...
[49:28.12]Oh, these are the treasures.
[49:28.84]These are the treasure... Um... Somebody just threw a toaster in here.
[49:34.20]How do I get out of here?
[49:42.35]It's... Okay, this... Get out of the water.
[49:45.87]Get out of the water.
[49:49.21]That guy has lightning.
[49:50.45]I told you.
[49:51.91]Do you guys remember when I played Hitman?
[49:54.61]And I made the reference, I threw like a fucking piece of electrical equipment into the ocean.
[50:01.41]And everyone laughed at me.
[50:03.15]Because I said I was gonna electrocute everybody that was currently in the Atlantic Ocean.
[50:09.34]Are you telling me that I'm, I'm, I'm bullshit?
[50:11.20]No.
[50:16.66]That guy just threw a little bit of electricity in a gigantic lake and killed me.
[50:24.23]That wouldn't happen.
[50:24.81]Would that?
[50:25.09]Okay.
[50:26.11]Seriously, Mythbusters.
[50:28.99]If I was in a... If I was in a lake this big, and somebody just put an electrical current into the water, what would happen?
[50:38.64]Would I be fine?
[50:42.53]No.
[50:44.25]Nothing?
[50:48.21]Okay, how small... Okay, what MythBuster level... How small would the body of water have to be if you put, like, 10,000 watts into the water?
[50:59.99]Are we talking, like, a large swimming pool?
[51:03.39]Not a bathtub.
[51:10.17]A kiddie pool.
[51:14.15]Let's go with lightning.
[51:15.31]KDK just gave 10 more subs.
[51:20.37]The electrodes would dissipate after 20 feet.
[51:23.62]What a- okay.
[51:26.18]So if I was in, like, a swimming pool, and you threw, like, a supercharged toaster into the swimming pool, plugged in, I'd be fine.
[51:35.14]Are we sure?
[51:40.45]Maybe.
[51:46.45]Let's test it.
[51:48.41]Uh, no!
[51:51.25]I just don't know, like I'm curious.
[51:53.77]Okay, if like if you, that's why they say get out of the water if like there's a thunderstorm, right?
[51:57.79]I remember when I was a kid, when I was like fucking 10, I had a pool.
[52:03.96]And it was always like the second that you would hear like, my father would fucking rip open the sliding door.
[52:12.28]Everybody get the fuck out of the pool right now.
[52:15.78]Dad, what are you talking about?
[52:16.96]Get out of the, he was like reaching and like trying to grab us, like get out.
[52:24.56]If lightning struck inside the pool... Alright, I'm gonna move on from this conversation because it's fucking stupid.
[52:37.02]Okay, if lightning struck the Atlantic Ocean while there were people swimming... Okay, I'm done.
[52:45.24]I have to concentrate.
[52:56.76]KDK!
[52:57.66]KDK, I think you're on auto-buy.
[53:03.23]Ow, ow, ow!
[53:04.55]No, not into the lightning water.
[53:06.31]What?
[53:06.51]No!
[53:06.77]Where's my heal?
[53:09.71]What the fuck is happening with my heal?
[53:21.20]All right.
[53:23.88]I took it off the bar because I was in the middle of a heated exchange.
[53:28.58]Okay.
[53:34.21]All right.
[53:34.69]Hey, look at how beautiful this is.
[53:36.01]Remember this?
[53:36.49]Ooh, thank God.
[53:42.19]All right, let's go.
[53:47.26]I don't need to go in the house.
[53:52.83]I need to go on top of the house, though, because that's where these guys are throwing shit at me from.
[53:56.09]Why would there be stealth grass here?
[54:00.36]I don't think I've ever aggroed one of these guys.
[54:11.64]He's just, like, snorting.
[54:13.28]What is that?
[54:13.66]Is that magic?
[54:24.34]He's just throwing punches at nothing.
[54:27.24]I don't know what that thing is.
[54:35.41]What bar is... Okay, what is he doing from me?
[54:37.15]Is he sucking souls from me?
[54:38.47]Alright, let's go back and kick this guy's ass.
[54:46.41]Did that guy just have 200 fucking dollars?
[54:50.95]Am I reading that right?
[54:58.07]Why don't I just grind these guys?
[55:04.03]Okay.
[55:06.41]Let's go around here, get the guy up top.
[55:21.62]But KDK, you've given so many subs.
[55:23.30]Thank you so much.
[55:31.60]Oops.
[55:32.26]Well, it's okay.
[55:33.84]Will he shoot arrows for me?
[55:41.26]Go get him!
[55:44.33]Will he?
[55:44.99]Go get him!
[55:50.43]Go!
[55:51.31]Go do something!
[55:54.16]They're both just looking at each other.
[55:55.38]What is that guy doing?
[56:09.23]Alright, well there goes that one.
[56:13.12]I just have this one more somewhere.
[56:18.92]Check for items.
[56:21.38]Holy shit, okay.
[56:23.96]Well, that...
[56:34.18]You know what?
[56:34.52]Okay, I'll tell you one gripe that I have with the game.
[56:37.34]Are you ready?
[56:38.20]Are you ready for it?
[56:38.84]Not a complaint, a gripe.
[56:39.94]It's different.
[56:40.96]So I'm in stealth right now, right?
[56:42.86]I'm in sneak mode.
[56:43.64]Here we go.
[56:44.12]I'm gonna backstab... Okay, I can't do it now.
[56:46.46]Alright, what I was gonna say was that was bad to... Listen.
[56:53.08]When you backstab somebody in stealth, you are automatically, like, standing up.
[56:57.84]I wish you would just stay crouching.
[57:01.60]Because if I sneak up and backstab somebody, you're just like this.
[57:04.50]Then you can just stand there.
[57:06.76]That was a little minor gripe.
[57:20.82]Ooh, you want to go again?
[57:28.63]How would you stab somebody without standing up?
[57:31.19]Yeah, but I mean, like, this is a video game.
[57:33.23]Alright, got the Grave Wax.
[57:34.13]I need, actually really do need these.
[57:35.57]This is a Nintendo game, guys.
[57:39.25]I didn't get that item, whatever it is.
[57:45.14]There's different rules.
[57:54.28]How do I get in?
[57:55.08]Ooh.
[57:55.96]This home has a little area over here.
[58:15.34]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[58:16.88]Ooh, ooh.
[58:17.94]What's that guy doing?
[58:18.77]Oh, he's sucking my life up.
[58:20.25]That guy's sucking my life up.
[58:22.23]Oh god, what happens when this fills up?
[58:24.79]What's wrong with me?
[58:28.41]Oh.
[58:38.58]The only way... This guy's from stage right.
[58:48.40]Alright, I think I should just keep going forward.
[58:54.57]So it makes you enfeebled.
[58:56.93]By the way, the one guy in chat, I did look over there and see somebody said, let it fill up, you get a flute, not a joke.
[59:05.40]Very clearly that turned out to be a fucking total bunch of horseshit.
[59:10.04]I didn't do that on purpose, but still, like, what dogshit.
[59:14.22]Never read in chat ever again, by the way.
[59:23.26]Like coins.
[59:23.70]There's good.
[59:24.30]There's items here that I want.
[59:27.00]I don't want to just disappear.
[59:32.91]No, no, no, no, no.
[59:34.05]Don't do it.
[59:34.41]I think it's just line of sight.
[59:57.09]Alright, can you... If you read this, suck a fart out of my ass.
[60:07.88]You're gonna regret that in like five years.
[60:27.32]Ooh, there's the slide!
[60:28.34]That's the first time I've seen that!
[60:29.54]He's gonna regret that one in five years.
[60:51.61]Any more items?
[60:56.25]Shitload of items over here.
[60:57.23]Apparently somebody can still... Oh, there's archers up there.
[61:14.54]Item surrounded by dogs.
[61:19.20]Two guys up here.
[61:22.24]Where's...
[61:24.40]Can I get up here without being seen by that one?
[61:26.80]Yep.
[61:26.94]See if I can get them both.
[61:37.09]Oh, that's not a backstab!
[61:38.23]Yes it is, in every book.
[61:52.27]You're only an hour in right now.
[61:53.79]Don't go too crazy.
[61:54.71]You're gonna burn out.
[61:58.30]I am the brightest star you've ever seen!
[62:01.60]No!
[62:01.96]No way!
[62:04.12]He's going to take the entire full brunt of a star!
[62:08.24]I laughed out loud when that line went out, by the way.
[62:12.01]No, he's crazy!
[62:13.29]There's no way he can take the full brunt of a star!
[62:19.49]I was the guy in the theater going...
[62:39.14]Peek-a-boo.
[62:41.20]That's how you do it.
[62:41.80]I want you to fucking clip that.
[62:42.82]I want you to fucking read into that when you talk about games, gamers that you should pay attention to.
[62:47.55]Top 10 gamers you should pay attention to in 2019.
[62:50.65]Look at that for a clip.
[62:52.17]Keep that one.
[63:07.84]Who's over here?
[63:12.15]Can't even get two.
[63:13.95]Two dogs.
[63:25.00]That thing got in the way.
[63:34.91]These things look like dog fishes.
[63:41.12]Yeah, okay.
[63:41.96]Yeah, I don't know.
[63:56.07]I think there's something wrong with him.
[63:59.89]I don't know.
[64:00.71]I was watching earlier and I feel like he was just kind of talking to somebody in his own head.
[64:05.70]It was really fucking weird.
[64:06.90]It was kind of maybe uncomfortable.
[64:08.78]I don't think I'll be watching again.
[64:20.07]Same.
[64:20.39]Alright, don't rest here.
[64:25.39]You know, you have to play together and not over each other.
[64:35.00]How many times are you gonna make the disillusioned viewer joke?
[64:38.76]As many times as I deem necessary.
[64:44.14]The disillusioned viewer joke.
[64:54.00]I do use it a lot, don't I?
[65:07.03]Every other streamer beat this game.
[65:08.45]Are you taking your time or are you just bad?
[65:11.41]Attack!
[65:11.95]Yeah, did they beat the fucking true monk first try?
[65:16.40]You show me somebody that did.
[65:23.92]I took two days off in the middle of this playthrough.
[65:26.72]Who the hell is that?
[65:29.96]I first tried two bosses in a row.
[65:31.56]You wanna find me a streamer that's capable or something like that?
[65:34.68]I think this is just an NPC.
[65:47.85]This is gonna be... I've seen Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
[65:52.13]I'm not gonna eat that.
[65:58.02]Okay.
[65:58.40]The courtyard is cursed.
[66:00.90]Ooh!
[66:25.55]That was a big one.
[66:32.59]They went up on two wheels for that one.
[66:40.12]There's a bite down.
[66:40.80]I don't even need the bite down anymore.
[66:41.92]I have the tooth.
[66:49.38]I need more information.
[66:50.92]Don't go through the courtyard.
[66:52.00]Why are you telling me this?
[66:53.75]I have a favor to ask you, young man.
[66:56.81]What is it?
[66:57.85]It's about my father.
[67:00.60]My father is now a noble.
[67:03.82]And the moment he became one,
[67:06.74]He found himself entranced by a carp.
[67:10.78]The great carp.
[67:12.87]For a long, long time since, he's done nothing but feed that cursed carp.
[67:19.73]Young man, please release my father from the carp's bewitching powers.
[67:27.58]I know my father wouldn't wish for an eternity like this.
[67:34.20]The Great Carp.
[67:42.38]I really hope this is not an underwater fight.
[67:43.96]They gave me the dive capability.
[67:45.36]Don't put an underwater fight here.
[67:46.70]That's the worst thing they could do.
[67:50.39]No.
[67:51.41]If there really is like an underwater boss fight or something...
[67:55.37]I already know what's going to happen.
[67:57.93]In like a year, I'm going to be reading and watching YouTube videos of top 10 FromSoftware bosses, and this is going to be number one.
[68:12.62]It wasn't the fight that was hard.
[68:13.96]It was dealing with being underwater, and it was unbearable.
[68:16.56]Oh, no.
[68:23.26]Ugh.
[68:24.99]I'm not ready for this.
[68:32.17]Go fight the giant fish.
[68:33.91]Alright, well... Can I, like, shot him up by throwing this at him?
[68:48.04]That's a tactic right there.
[68:55.73]A giant fish boss.
[68:57.65]Oh.
[68:59.02]Is that a boss?
[68:59.62]No.
[69:00.34]Mini boss?
[69:04.42]No.
[69:13.54]Not yet.
[69:17.90]No!
[69:20.12]I can't, can't, can't, can't, can't.
[69:21.70]How do I do something about this?
[69:22.66]What do I do?
[69:24.00]I don't know how to...
[69:33.31]That happened so fast, I thought I had at least a second or two.
[69:38.76]Why did that go so fast?
[69:42.50]Dude, that bar filled so much faster than it ever has.
[69:47.16]Mad because bad.
[69:55.73]Mad because bad.
[69:56.73]Mad because bad.
[69:57.79]Mad because bad.
[70:00.22]I'm not mad at all.
[70:02.64]Look, there's no way you saw me through there.
[70:07.66]Stupid.
[70:08.38]Dumb.
[70:09.81]Nothing about it is fun.
[70:11.17]Nothing about this is fun!
[70:20.63]Oh my god.
[70:23.70]Alright, I have an indicator here.
[70:25.40]What is it?
[70:25.70]Is it a slash?
[70:27.08]Is it a dash?
[70:28.22]Is it a crash?
[70:29.48]I don't know.
[70:29.86]I have the indicator for what?
[70:36.31]What is the indicator for if I can't do anything?
[70:39.13]It's a grab, but I can't dodge.
[70:43.31]I thought maybe you could time it and stop it.
[70:51.68]Um...
[70:53.72]Well, this went from my favorite area to being my least favorite area in any FromSoftware game that they've ever done.
[71:03.66]And I'm talking worse than Lost Izalith.
[71:11.85]I mean, what, did you not finish this one too?
[71:14.99]Goddamn.
[71:16.27]Unbelievable.
[71:17.23]Unbelievable.
[71:20.85]Not even fun.
[71:25.03]What?
[71:25.35]What was it hitting the wall?
[71:26.69]What was it hitting?
[71:27.47]What?
[71:28.31]What was it hitting?
[71:30.99]I... Why was... I couldn't do the shuriken.
[71:43.84]Like, I threw two shurikens and it hit the thing... It hit the fucking fence.
[71:57.13]Don't do it again.
[72:07.82]Give me a break.
[72:21.75]Don't, don't, don't!
[72:24.50]Oh my god!
[72:25.52]I have to turn the co- why?
[72:27.28]Why?!
[72:30.55]I have to swing at him!
[72:41.57]Oh my god.
[72:46.79]Yeah, one of the only- one of like the two stealth sections in this whole game.
[72:53.43]Activision made him do that.
[72:55.69]Activision told him to put a stealth mechanic in.
[73:00.07]Wait, wait, this is Activision.
[73:01.27]We need stealth in our video games and all of our third-person adventure games.
[73:22.49]No, slow them down.
[73:27.13]I want them to progress through this area at a snail's fucking pace.
[73:33.09]And then they're expected to parry like 200 fucking times in two seconds.
[73:43.55]I don't care if they're going to kill me.
[73:44.79]I'll keep smoking them.
[74:34.98]Oh my god.
[75:28.71]What is that noise?
[75:35.20]One, two, three...
[75:48.33]That's not safe.
[75:49.45]That's not safe over there.
[76:00.24]Ew, liver.
[76:00.88]Cool.
[76:01.36]It can go that way.
[76:01.96]Let's check.
[76:08.90]I'm just fucking around, guys.
[76:16.62]This is faux outrage.
[76:18.24]I'm faux angry.
[76:23.37]Ooh, gunpowder.
[76:36.76]Don't you guys know the true meaning of when I'm angry?
[76:40.20]My voice gets shorter.
[76:42.96]I don't announce the words.
[76:45.00]I say things fast.
[76:45.82]Like this.
[76:46.98]My voice drops down like this.
[76:49.02]No, it's fucking stupid.
[76:49.82]It's fucking dumb.
[76:52.32]I don't fucking... It's fucking not even fun.
[76:54.60]That's how you get dumb.
[76:55.42]When I do impressions of Activision fucking suits, I'm not... This is fun.
[76:59.71]I'm having a good time.
[77:01.97]Wait.
[77:11.45]Why would they put this?
[77:12.09]Of course.
[77:17.26]Oh my god.
[77:22.32]Please tell me they turn this way.
[77:24.04]Do they go down there?
[77:26.04]Why?
[77:26.42]This is scripted.
[77:27.90]This is a scripted event.
[77:45.02]Okay.
[77:45.94]Where do they go, though?
[77:59.40]Okay.
[77:59.64]I need to get this item because they're going to come back right now.
[78:02.60]Confetti.
[78:02.84]I need that.
[78:04.83]Oh!
[78:06.19]Oh, no.
[78:06.83]Oh, no.
[78:07.21]Oh, no.
[78:07.67]Oh, no.
[78:08.87]Oh, no?
[78:10.65]They don't know where I am.
[78:17.61]Oh fuck, I gotta kill that motherfucker right now.
[78:23.91]Where is he?
[78:37.00]One down.
[78:46.53]It's Shito.
[78:52.57]That's right.
[78:53.83]Alright, this is the strategy.
[78:55.01]Are you ready?
[78:55.67]It has to work.
[78:57.59]This has to work.
[79:00.12]Okay, uh, strategy is firecrackers.
[79:03.58]Firecrackers kill guy.
[79:06.80]One, two, three.
[79:27.17]Alright, I could've shut up.
[79:36.88]Is there anybody in here?
[79:38.66]No.
[79:40.18]I almost just fucking died.
[79:41.02]Okay, so I can go here.
[79:45.66]Question is, is this the only guy in here?
[79:48.06]I don't know.
[79:50.98]I think that's the only guy here.
[79:53.96]If it's not, then I'm fucking jumping right back up.
[80:20.17]Okay.
[80:22.21]I don't think there's very... There's only a couple guys on the bridge.
[80:32.66]I want to jump back up here.
[80:37.46]I can't get up there?
[80:40.54]I just came from here.
[80:55.67]Alright, that's that.
[80:56.65]That's done.
[80:58.21]What about over here?
[81:00.51]Anybody?
[81:03.43]I don't think... I think I got him.
[81:05.23]Alright, I'm just going to keep going around.
[81:14.45]Alright, what about this way?
[81:17.11]What do we got?
[81:17.59]We got... Guy on bridge over here, right?
[81:22.65]No.
[81:23.70]Two guys over there.
[81:27.13]Oh, goddammit.
[81:27.95]There's no way to hide up there?
[81:44.86]Yep, I can- can I?
[81:48.14]I'm not sure where to go.
[81:54.47]I wonder.
[81:59.00]I can't go that way yet.
[82:00.47]I mean, I guess I could.
[82:01.47]I could backstab that guy across the way.
[82:03.69]We'll see.
[82:11.11]I mean, there's stealth grass right here.
[82:15.83]Is this stealth grass?
[82:18.43]I don't know.
[82:23.84]Oh, goddammit.
[82:26.58]Ugh.
[82:28.70]This is a real stealth section.
[82:32.02]They're like, you know what?
[82:33.04]We're like 24 hours into the game.
[82:34.86]Throw a real, actual stealth section into the game.
[82:43.19]I just, I just, that guy not gonna turn around and see this shit?
[82:47.41]If he does, I'm gonna be in fucking trouble.
[82:54.83]Why?!
[82:55.69]No!
[82:58.65]Wait, get in the water!
[83:02.33]Oh my god, there's a guy here!
[83:03.45]Who is it, who is it?
[83:14.22]What's with the indicators?
[83:16.58]No, don't!
[83:18.26]Get out, get out, run!
[83:26.70]I don't even know where that guy came from.
[83:28.06]Oh, fuck.
[83:32.64]Okay, I can deal with him here.
[83:44.08]What's with the fucking, all those indicators, man?
[83:47.45]You're killing me.
[83:52.21]Oh, you're killing me.
[83:53.97]It's like the president.
[83:55.71]Oh no, it's the president of the Whistle Club.
[83:57.95]What do I do?
[83:59.39]Is he... Oh, it's Gandalf.
[84:04.08]It's the Albus Dumbledore.
[84:06.16]How many more jokes can I make before I kill him?
[84:07.80]Let's see.
[84:25.25]Okay.
[84:28.13]How much more is left in this section?
[84:29.81]I don't like this place.
[84:31.99]I don't like this place.
[84:33.34]If I fuck up anything... Imagine right now.
[84:36.38]Imagine just fucking up now.
[84:38.72]And having to do the whole section over again.
[84:41.02]I don't care if I look like a coward.
[84:42.88]I'm going to do this as slow and as meticulously and as stupid as I possibly can.
[84:56.95]Alright, there's two on the bridge.
[85:00.03]This guy, there's two guys over here?
[85:01.87]Yep.
[85:02.35]I don't even know where the fucking President Wizard came from.
[85:04.91]I don't know.
[85:07.91]I think he saw me from across the game.
[85:10.79]So now... Oh...
[85:36.54]How effective is this, though?
[85:37.76]Will he see me if I walk out here stealthed?
[85:58.02]Oh my god, it works.
[85:59.34]It works!
[86:01.74]Holy shit, it works!
[86:03.02]Oh!
[86:07.23]Is there any more?
[86:07.75]I don't know, who's over there?
[86:11.75]Is there a guy?
[86:13.09]It's a magician.
[86:21.16]Slow down.
[86:31.78]Just stay back here.
[86:32.46]No one will know I'm here.
[86:50.37]Fuck, man.
[86:50.87]That would have been such a nightmare.
[86:52.06]He keeps crawling around the corner.
[86:58.42]This is harder than a boss.
[86:59.96]It's not that it's hard.
[87:01.74]It's just take... Ooh, I found a thing.
[87:10.31]Thank God.
[87:12.37]Thank God.
[87:14.41]Wait, I hear something moving.
[87:21.14]There's gonna be one right here.
[87:22.44]I'm not gonna be able to commune with this.
[87:30.87]Oh, yes.
[87:39.15]Oh.
[87:41.30]Oh, I feel so much better.
[87:42.56]I have money, though.
[87:50.73]I got, like, I have money, I gotta go back and spend this.
[87:57.06]What was I gonna get here?
[87:57.84]This, right?
[87:59.50]Kreese's damage inflicted posture was successful in the cure.
[88:02.59]I wanted this.
[88:06.41]That one's really good.
[88:08.19]I land that pretty frequently, so.
[88:13.24]And I have money that I need to spend.
[88:21.98]Why did I rest?
[88:23.18]It's probably... I don't know.
[88:23.86]I'm just paranoid.
[88:25.26]And I just did a muscle memory.
[88:27.20]Just press the button.
[88:33.67]Okay.
[88:36.11]Let's see how much further I can go down here.
[88:40.55]I need... I got the money.
[88:44.53]But I need gunpowder.
[88:47.73]Does somebody sell gunpowder?
[88:50.79]Yeah, I don't think this guy does.
[88:58.27]Who sells gunpowder?
[89:01.97]Okay.
[89:06.95]How many do you have?
[89:07.52]Just one?
[89:10.96]Oh, damn.
[89:11.94]I can just buy you up ten of them!
[89:14.82]I need two for now.
[89:17.32]Right?
[89:17.50]Was it four or five?
[89:18.35]What was it?
[89:28.53]Four or five?
[89:29.13]I think it was four.
[89:30.17]Yeah.
[89:30.81]Alright, so this is... I'm upgrading my favorite item in the game.
[89:34.14]Long Spark.
[89:36.04]The effect to be prolonged for longer than the average firecracker.
[89:39.24]And the flames bloom for a short time.
[89:41.86]Nice.
[89:45.40]We're getting there.
[89:53.82]Let's put it on.
[89:55.34]So I got spring-loaded firecracker.
[89:58.18]Shinobi firecracker.
[90:00.80]Wait.
[90:04.68]Am I stupid?
[90:09.78]No, it's got long... Okay, I already had one.
[90:11.35]Okay, I was like, wait a minute.
[90:12.45]Yeah, long spark.
[90:20.73]Let's try it.
[90:28.09]I didn't even look at what this does.
[90:30.91]One can fluidly swap between two separate sets of attacks as desired.
[90:35.87]That's cool.
[90:37.94]Spring-loaded axe.
[90:38.82]I mean, it's pretty default of me, but I really do like these the most.
[90:44.18]Let's see how this looks.
[90:49.18]Call me a default streamer, but that's fine.
[90:54.69]Whoa.
[90:55.63]Well, that takes a little longer to do, but that's...
[91:04.78]I wonder how much different that is.
[91:07.98]That's a long cast time.
[91:10.70]Hmm.
[91:11.66]We'll see.
[91:17.31]No, okay, I don't have to hold it.
[91:18.71]Alright, that's... that's... looks better.
[91:20.21]Alright, so we ended up... Fountainhead Palace.
[91:30.11]One, two, three.
[91:33.61]Wait!
[91:35.94]Wait, I need my money.
[91:37.20]I gotta store my money in sacks.
[91:45.78]I got 600 bucks iron.
[91:46.86]If I can store it.
[91:57.85]Money is stored in the balls.
[92:00.11]Yeah.
[92:06.97]That's an old one.
[92:07.63]That's very old.
[92:11.41]Alright, I can buy one of these.
[92:14.97]Which leaves me with 80 bucks, so I might as well just buy a pellet for fun.
[92:19.95]Just have a ton of them in my inventory.
[92:23.69]And speaking of which... Okay, okay, okay.
[92:27.28]I'm ready to dish out the paint.
[92:43.14]I've never watched you until now and heard of you from Joel, but you, good sir, have me moderately entertained.
[92:49.16]Well, welcome.
[92:51.58]Can we get a welcome in the chat for Benric, please?
[92:56.26]That's what we do to all new viewers.
[92:57.40]We welcome them.
[93:02.37]Let me look over here.
[93:05.47]Moderately.
[93:06.05]I am moderately entertained.
[93:09.07]Well, that's good.
[93:12.81]Hey, first impressions are the most important thing.
[93:14.57]I feel like I've given a bad first impression this stream.
[93:22.47]Ooh, more Divine Confetti.
[93:35.22]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[93:36.78]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[93:39.74]Look at this.
[93:41.48]Something over here.
[93:42.32]Yes, there is.
[93:42.94]Look it.
[93:54.69]Go!
[93:56.37]Up, up, up, up, up.
[93:57.07]Go up, up, and jump.
[93:58.05]Oh, jump!
[93:58.97]Jump before he throws the toaster.
[94:00.31]Quick!
[94:02.76]Jesus, that saved me.
[94:04.10]Did you see?
[94:04.62]I've done that too.
[94:06.02]What the fuck is that?
[94:08.78]Was that the lightning?
[94:10.42]What just crashed through the bridge?
[94:13.80]What the hell was that?
[94:16.13]What just went in the water?
[94:23.87]Uh... Okay.
[94:30.86]I thought that was a lightning bolt.
[94:33.96]I'm gonna rest it.
[94:35.98]If I rest the bridge, it'll be back, right?
[94:40.46]Goddammit, this is Mario World.
[94:42.26]This is the fish from Mario.
[94:43.32]It's the same colors, too.
[94:45.86]This is the gigantic fish from Super Mario World, level 3-6.
[95:00.47]Dear God.
[95:05.07]Well, I made it across the bridge.
[95:08.25]Is he just in there?
[95:11.18]It's a water boss fight.
[95:13.48]It's an underwater boss fight.
[95:15.26]Oh, I'm not happy about this.
[95:16.62]No, I'm so bad underwater in every game.
[95:21.65]I'm terrible under pressure.
[95:24.15]Literally by the water pressure.
[95:25.67]I can't do it.
[95:30.99]Oh no, I'm panicking already.
[95:32.89]I'm like psyching myself up.
[96:07.33]Okay, I want to get up there because there's an item Hmm can I make this jump from here?
[96:19.21]I don't think I can make this jump Well, let's take care of this first
[96:39.41]Aggressive.
[96:39.87]Aggressive.
[96:40.41]Aggressive.
[96:45.49]Can I get up top, maybe?
[96:47.21]I can go there.
[96:54.34]And then over here.
[96:56.34]Oh, come on!
[97:00.62]Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[97:02.44]Where am I?
[97:06.66]Where the fuck did I end up?
[97:09.39]Uh, what the hell?
[97:13.47]I'm... I can get back up.
[97:20.28]I just heard a fucking burp.
[97:22.86]That was a burp?
[97:28.75]There we go.
[97:29.97]Alright, let's get back over here.
[97:36.72]Alright.
[97:38.21]Takes us down here.
[97:39.23]And then I gotta... I'm just gonna have to jump from here, right?
[97:45.31]Am I gonna make this?
[97:47.63]There's nowhere to grab.
[98:03.56]Guys, I scream in real life.
[98:05.92]Okay, when something like that happens.
[98:07.18]Okay.
[98:09.49]What am I doing here?
[98:10.23]Just... I forget it.
[98:11.01]Forget it.
[98:11.41]Forget it.
[98:11.77]I don't even want it.
[98:13.61]Yeah, I do.
[98:14.45]No, I don't.
[98:14.79]I don't even want it.
[98:18.63]I should change my title, too.
[98:19.85]When I get hit, I pretend to get hurt in the game.
[98:31.54]Did you see that?
[98:33.92]What was with that spawn thing?
[98:36.14]Did you see the spawns here?
[98:46.03]What?!
[98:47.85]Alright, guy over there.
[98:56.64]I'm just trying to cover all my bases here, guys.
[99:05.29]I don't want any bullshit to come kill me.
[99:07.13]Somebody to fly and gonzo me or something.
[99:10.30]We're taken care of.
[99:11.46]Oh, I can get through from here.
[99:12.64]I win.
[99:22.80]Figured it out.
[99:24.63]No, I can't.
[99:26.45]Really?
[99:26.75]There's no way for me to grab anything from here?
[99:29.67]How am I supposed to get this item?
[99:36.65]How did I get that item?
[99:43.07]There's a bridge.
[99:44.84]I can't cross the bridge.
[99:47.22]Do you not see the bridge broken in half?
[99:49.14]I can't make that jump.
[99:53.09]Cross the bridge?
[99:54.39]That's a forehead comment, right?
[100:02.99]Just crossed the bridge.
[100:04.05]Forehead.
[100:04.87]It has to be.
[100:06.93]There's no bridge.
[100:12.11]Rebuild it.
[100:16.81]Alright.
[100:17.29]You ready for this one?
[100:18.55]No.
[100:19.05]Just kidding.
[100:22.65]I have a feeling.
[100:27.18]Let's just keep moving.
[100:28.08]Whatever.
[100:28.56]That item is probably the best item in the game and I'm not going to get it.
[100:34.65]Whatever.
[100:42.26]There's an equally as cool item down here.
[100:48.31]Wait.
[100:51.35]No secret waterfall entrance?
[100:54.11]No.
[100:55.31]Is there?
[101:03.99]Okay, what about... Let me just check.
[101:05.23]Okay, I can go up from there.
[101:11.05]I want to get that, whatever it is, though.
[101:13.11]And then I can get back up, right?
[101:18.25]Is that a water dog?
[101:20.55]Two water dogs.
[101:23.47]Three water dogs.
[101:26.37]Four water dogs?
[101:29.56]Oh fuck!
[101:30.32]It's an electricity dog!
[101:31.96]Kill it quick!
[101:33.72]Oh my god.
[101:36.64]Wouldn't that kill the dog?
[101:38.88]It would kill the dog!
[101:41.26]Um... Where?
[101:43.80]Where are I?
[101:44.40]Where?
[101:44.62]Where?
[101:52.93]Just because you have electricity coming out of you doesn't mean you're immune to electricity.
[101:57.47]Okay?
[102:02.76]That was lucky.
[102:05.00]Don't you know, even when Pikachu gets struck by lightning, it still does like 5% damage.
[102:11.01]It's just not very effective.
[102:13.07]It still hurts.
[102:16.81]Look, even, okay, if you put yourself in a suit of armor, and then you jumped in front of a train, you're gonna be fine.
[102:25.09]It's gonna hurt, though.
[102:33.55]That was a baby.
[102:35.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[103:13.74]Fuck that.
[103:14.42]I don't wanna fight you, I don't care.
[103:18.70]Okay, get me up.
[103:19.60]Jump!
[103:20.08]Grab it!
[103:20.76]No!
[103:22.44]No, get me away!
[103:23.77]Is he gonna shoot me through the wall?
[103:25.21]How far does his, like, smite ultimate beam go?
[103:29.49]Ugh!
[103:31.07]Okay.
[103:31.83]We're alright.
[103:40.97]Jesus.
[103:43.25]Um... I think I gotta go in that building.
[103:46.79]If I were taking a guess.
[103:50.91]Could deal with these two.
[103:53.97]I still have plenty of health.
[103:54.85]I got out of there quick.
[103:55.75]That was lucky.
[103:56.49]Let me deal with one of these.
[104:02.89]Oh man, that's too many.
[104:07.56]Uh...
[104:09.54]What's this way?
[104:14.72]I think I have to... I don't... I don't know.
[104:22.95]Fuck it.
[104:33.94]Okay, watch out for the guy playing soccer.
[104:36.19]Alright, where do I go?
[104:37.49]Where do I go?
[104:38.97]Where do I go?
[104:41.07]Where's progression?
[104:44.38]I think I'm going over this way.
[104:46.44]Yep, I found progression.
[104:48.82]There's no way I can do that.
[104:50.20]I'm sorry.
[104:50.64]I'm not stupid.
[105:02.31]These are lightning dogs.
[105:05.05]Be prepared, be prepared for the lightning!
[105:15.18]Alright, progression.
[105:18.24]Litecoin... is down like seven or eight hundred percent since last year.
[105:30.85]More electricity dogs.
[105:45.46]That's a new enemy there.
[105:46.59]That's a big guy.
[105:47.99]It's a big bearded octopus person.
[105:51.75]Um...
[106:05.41]Hmm.
[106:08.73]Does he have two bars?
[106:09.59]Is that a mini-boss or is that... an NPC?
[106:13.27]I don't know.
[106:14.75]I'm going to keep going around this way.
[106:15.81]I'm going to progress.
[106:18.19]Go fight it?
[106:18.71]Just hold on.
[106:20.17]I'm not going to go fight that right now.
[106:21.57]I need a new stone.
[106:24.53]If I die, I have to go all the way... You can't even see how far away I have to go.
[106:28.23]All the way down there.
[106:31.88]This is like 35 minutes of progression.
[106:34.98]I ain't gonna blow this.
[106:49.16]Oh, what the fuck are you talking about, man?
[106:51.13]Are you serious?
[106:52.93]There's another one.
[106:56.17]Why is there another one here?
[106:58.45]Do I have to go...
[107:03.29]I don't believe it.
[107:04.59]I'm not going over there.
[107:06.43]I have to, though.
[107:08.29]I have to... That's the same one?
[107:13.55]No, it's not.
[107:15.09]The other one was down that way.
[107:17.93]Is there any way I can go up from there?
[107:19.33]I need to look.
[107:21.21]I think I can.
[107:22.71]Dodge.
[107:23.61]Dodges have to be on point right now.
[107:32.07]Yeah, call that one, it's sick!
[107:34.31]Yeah, yeah, ooh!
[107:38.18]I don't think he's that good at this game.
[107:42.28]What am I doing?
[107:43.44]Hope this is not a bad idea.
[107:55.62]I'm actually terrified.
[108:03.77]Is it a beach?
[108:04.81]A house?
[108:07.59]Come on, give me a thing to grab.
[108:11.01]Come on, please!
[108:13.15]No, don't do it like this.
[108:14.35]Don't do it like this!
[108:15.25]Something to grab.
[108:19.28]I can't... Nothing to grab?
[108:22.04]Oh, come on.
[108:23.64]You gotta be kidding me.
[108:24.54]Not like this, man.
[108:28.64]I can make it.
[108:32.24]I can make it.
[109:06.28]Fuck.
[109:07.54]Uh...
[109:11.36]Oh no.
[109:12.98]Kill that guy first.
[109:13.90]I don't even know where that guy is.
[109:15.22]He's like up here.
[109:16.05]I just killed probably the least dangerous guy.
[109:49.42]He just double tapped me.
[109:51.06]No, that's not fair.
[109:53.34]I was on the ground and it bounced on my head.
[109:56.78]What?
[109:59.58]Oh, fuck off.
[110:00.93]Fuck off with this.
[110:01.77]I'm out of here.
[110:04.75]There's nowhere... I don't know where to go.
[110:06.65]There's nowhere to go.
[110:08.15]There's an item.
[110:18.59]Oh shit, there's two items.
[110:19.57]Nice.
[110:34.46]And who's that guy over here to... There's gonna be one path to get back, to get up this way.
[110:49.31]Right?
[110:49.55]Like, look, it's over there.
[110:50.69]I can't get up from here.
[110:52.63]There's the bad guy.
[111:00.14]He appears as an illusion.
[111:02.18]What about behind the waterfall?
[111:04.34]I'm going for it.
[111:04.94]Let's see.
[111:06.08]Nope.
[111:07.95]That just ain't gonna happen.
[111:09.59]That just ain't gonna happen.
[111:10.93]I'm telling you.
[111:11.93]That's not gonna happen.
[111:12.99]That ain't gonna happen.
[111:24.47]I have to get the terror potion.
[111:25.61]Anybody that has the terror build up that takes like five seconds for the terror to kill you?
[111:30.57]You gotta get confetti and you have to get like the terror potion shit.
[111:50.89]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[111:52.97]Did you really just hit me from that far away?
[111:55.51]What game is this?
[111:57.72]What video game is this?
[111:59.04]That was a homing missile from across the game.
[112:03.44]What game is this?
[112:24.37]Kill the streamer.
[112:38.66]I just don't... I'm maybe on the roof?
[112:41.61]Like, up here?
[112:42.23]I got from behind!
[112:44.39]Oh my... Oh my god.
[112:48.97]Why?
[112:50.47]Why?
[112:55.31]I have to go all the way around this.
[113:02.05]I'm trying to just skip.
[113:03.76]Thanks for the unforeseen aid.
[113:04.86]Appreciate it.
[113:06.34]No, fuck it, I'm just going.
[113:10.58]Go.
[113:12.04]Go.
[113:21.82]Yeah, fuck off.
[113:24.89]Can I make this from here?
[113:25.67]I don't know!
[113:28.57]Let me try!
[113:40.52]What's the ultimate goal?
[113:42.99]To go back around this way?
[113:52.49]Like, up there, but how the fuck do I get over there?
[114:19.71]Let me grab it from here, but there's no grabbing point.
[114:23.17]Like, underneath and then up.
[114:24.67]That's kind of what I did before.
[114:25.93]Because there's no grabbing point here.
[114:28.59]Okay.
[114:57.94]Oh, thank God.
[114:58.58]I found it.
[115:00.42]Okay.
[115:01.04]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[115:08.86]There's a door.
[115:09.94]Um?
[115:11.06]Who?
[115:21.97]No, I don't dare.
[115:26.56]Of course not.
[115:33.64]Everybody's still alive, so this is bad.
[115:47.49]I'll take one at a time.
[115:50.19]Come on.
[115:50.43]Let's go.
[115:50.81]Fight.
[115:51.11]Let's go.
[115:51.43]Let's go.
[115:51.73]Let's go.
[115:52.01]Come on.
[115:52.39]I can take two.
[115:52.89]I've done it before.
[115:54.11]I'm good.
[116:35.31]Anybody else up here?
[116:38.07]Anybody?
[116:38.43]Anybody?
[116:38.77]Anybody?
[116:42.21]I just don't want to have a problem later.
[116:49.63]Come on, video games, video games, video games, video games, video games.
[116:53.49]Alright, maybe I shouldn't have any more caffeine.
[117:04.50]What's wrong with you?
[117:05.32]I'm just happy.
[117:06.54]I'm just having a good time.
[117:09.60]Now, this is where I'm going to make a major mistake.
[117:13.72]Can I jump from here and grab something over there?
[117:20.45]No, I'm going to go that way.
[117:26.73]Because there's a place I haven't gone down there.
[117:28.63]And we're going to do it... Don't get stuck in a wall.
[117:34.09]I'm gonna do it the correct way, which is, like, stuff my body in here and glitch into the wall and to a point where I can fall down those stairs.
[117:45.02]I fucking... I hate myself so much.
[117:47.26]I fucking can't believe it.
[117:48.40]There's an invisible wall there.
[117:49.72]I can't fucking believe it.
[117:50.60]I cannot believe it.
[117:51.29]I can't believe it.
[117:52.25]I can't believe it.
[117:57.43]I can't do it.
[117:58.11]I can't fucking believe it.
[118:09.75]I'm so disappointed in myself.
[118:12.16]I'm so disappointed.
[118:15.50]Oh, the disappointment is unreal.
[118:22.99]It's okay, I'm here.
[118:27.72]Like, typically, I would be mad about, like, the bad grade I got on my report card.
[118:32.52]None of my parents would be.
[118:34.36]My parents would be upset with what I just brought home.
[118:36.44]I'm actually more upset than they are.
[118:48.52]Why does that keep happening?
[118:50.88]Alright, let's go.
[118:57.14]Oh my lord, line of sight.
[119:02.48]I can't hit anything through a goddamn wall.
[119:05.02]Stupid.
[119:25.77]You're almost as dumb as me.
[119:26.79]There's an idol right there.
[119:51.97]Is this a mini-boss?
[119:54.23]Target him so... No, it's not a mini-boss.
[119:56.84]I just have to deal with this.
[119:59.35]Sit down.
[119:59.97]Don't stand up.
[120:00.77]Hey, guys!
[120:34.86]The nightmare is over.
[120:36.44]For now.
[120:46.38]For now.
[120:47.36]How much money do I have?
[120:48.78]I got a lot of money.
[120:53.50]I'm going back and buying a gift.
[120:55.39]Whatever the hell they are.
[121:00.89]500.
[121:00.91]That's a lot of money in this game.
[121:12.57]Wait, you guys don't think $500 is a lot of money?
[121:16.11]What are you talking about?
[121:17.23]Wait, $550.
[121:19.91]Oh, shit.
[121:20.65]Okay, I'll sell a couple of dumb things.
[121:26.54]Where's my... Large amount of ashes.
[121:30.44]Yeah, whatever.
[121:39.69]Okay.
[121:45.55]continue great sakura germa's afraid of headless yeah I am I can but I I can admit that I'm terrified of fighting that I'm terrified of finding any of the magical people
[122:14.78]Um, let me just try to kill this guy, for fun.
[122:29.25]Dragon?
[122:29.75]Oh, Gatsaki!
[122:36.55]That didn't hit him?
[122:37.61]Ehh.
[122:51.07]Oh, that's not going to work.
[122:53.69]Somebody else is hitting me now.
[122:55.54]That was a bad idea.
[122:57.24]That was fun.
[122:57.64]I'm going to go this way now.
[123:00.14]Oh, there's a mini-boss.
[123:02.56]Under pressure, that's how I work.
[123:04.18]What is that?
[123:04.56]Okay, he kicks balls.
[123:07.80]That's a lightning ball.
[123:08.76]Okay, I got these idiots over here fighting me.
[123:11.04]Just die.
[123:13.01]I've got five people throwing rocks at me from behind me.
[123:19.31]Come on.
[123:26.25]Let's go.
[123:26.65]You and me.
[123:27.23]Lightning balls?
[123:28.07]Fine.
[123:29.33]Just get up on him right now.
[123:33.25]What?
[123:33.41]That hit me.
[123:37.21]That's okay.
[123:37.63]You have to long wind up.
[123:43.66]Long?
[123:43.92]It's even longer than that.
[123:44.90]Wait, didn't... I don't have a move to stop that from happening?
[123:53.46]Okay, what...
[123:58.06]I thought I could, like... Oh, that guy, you suck.
[124:10.25]Yeah, it's attack while you're in the air.
[124:11.53]Don't just... Fucking my god.
[124:13.25]I know how to do it.
[124:14.13]You don't have to, like, demonstrate.
[124:16.61]Oh, thank god.
[124:17.49]Oh, yeah.
[124:19.11]At first, I... At first, me.
[124:20.03]At first, down.
[124:20.67]I gotta breathe.
[124:39.29]Nice, thousand bucks.
[124:40.17]Alright, there's no more electricity.
[124:44.05]Except that, is that guy electricity?
[124:48.06]Electricity gone.
[124:51.86]I gotta kill this guy.
[124:55.74]He's facing the other way.
[124:56.52]He doesn't even know I'm here.
[125:08.10]Oh.
[125:08.24]It's this lady.
[125:09.16]I was supposed to backstab this lady.
[125:10.88]Yes.
[125:16.19]You got these great directions.
[125:18.39]Yes.
[125:35.83]Large cave.
[125:39.20]Ugh.
[125:42.96]No.
[125:45.38]Here it comes.
[125:46.10]I've been trying to avoid having to do this.
[125:52.40]Open the door to the palace.
[125:54.78]It's underwater and it's through a cave that's down here under the water.
[125:58.27]And by the way, fight the fish boss.
[126:02.95]Well, it begins.
[126:10.51]See you guys in like four hours.
[126:14.19]Lamp of wax.
[126:31.02]Okay, so...
[126:33.38]Is the palace this way, or is the palace under here?
[126:39.16]Let's just take a look underwater.
[126:42.87]It's over here.
[126:47.71]The Great Carp.
[126:49.87]Not an underwater boss!
[126:52.89]No, they can't do it to us like this.
[126:55.07]They can't do this to us like this.
[127:12.29]God damn it.
[127:14.47]Oh, fuck.
[127:17.67]It's a giant goldfish.
[127:31.29]Whatever this is, just let me have it.
[127:32.47]Coin purse.
[127:34.11]Oh my god!
[127:39.53]He's dead?
[127:40.57]He's dead!
[127:41.87]He's dead!
[127:42.85]I killed him!
[127:44.83]I killed him!
[127:54.44]He rolled over like he was in somebody's tank.
[127:59.20]What?
[128:02.95]Why did he do that?
[128:06.07]Just get me out.
[128:13.17]Wait!
[128:15.25]Am I safe in here?
[128:19.19]But where's... How do I get... Is there a hole up there?
[128:33.66]Oh my god, Jeremy, get in the hole, please!
[128:41.83]Ugh!
[128:48.10]He seriously rolled over.
[128:51.27]Like he was dead.
[128:52.33]Like that was his final breath.
[128:53.71]I made it.
[129:06.75]He smashed his head into a rock.
[129:13.65]His last dash.
[129:16.07]That's so funny.
[129:17.51]I wish that were the case.
[129:22.28]Well.
[129:24.10]Waterfall.
[129:25.62]I guess.
[129:29.32]What's up here?
[129:33.40]Oh, alright.
[129:35.10]Wait, I'm gonna... Let me examine first.
[129:38.99]You never know, there might be something hidden.
[129:45.77]No.
[129:46.35]It was worth a shot.
[129:55.25]Up.
[129:55.41]What the hell?
[130:01.09]Hmm.
[130:02.39]I think I found the back door to the palace.
[130:07.99]This really is a pretty, pretty, pretty zone.
[130:12.57]The fish.
[130:12.95]That fish is cool.
[130:15.20]Thank God I don't have to fight it right now.
[130:18.62]Hopefully it's just like the snake from earlier, and it's just a giant annoying obstacle.
[130:31.69]I'm missing a ton of hidden shit.
[130:33.07]Yeah, I... Look, I got an... I can go back there any time I want.
[130:37.09]I have a new sculpture here.
[130:38.59]I am safe.
[130:52.46]Alright.
[130:56.70]Let's see what's in here.
[131:00.85]That's the room full of those people.
[131:06.73]I'm getting Bloodborne vibes from these people.
[131:12.10]There's a door.
[131:16.08]I might just stay here.
[131:24.34]Where's your flute?
[131:32.83]You guys don't have flutes.
[131:36.97]Well, what's behind the door?
[131:38.77]Is this a shortcut?
[131:46.46]Yes, this is the door from earlier.
[131:49.74]But this is not really a shortcut.
[131:55.01]Because I just have an idol right here.
[131:56.63]You know what I mean?
[132:04.16]Why would I use that shortcut?
[132:12.20]That's a chest.
[132:14.44]It's like a coffin.
[132:15.12]Is there a dead body in here?
[132:18.46]Bunch of dead coins.
[132:20.59]Well, I know.
[132:21.01]I'm going back right now.
[132:26.06]Oh, the lady wanted me to open that.
[132:27.30]Right, okay.
[132:30.30]What the hell is this?
[132:39.20]Uh, let's go... I'll go back and talk to the lady.
[132:41.94]Is she still in the same place?
[132:47.99]Oh, it's just you.
[132:51.41]Well, that's a... that's a stab.
[132:55.81]Okay, don't embarrass me here.
[132:58.06]Standard enemy.
[132:58.74]I knew that was coming.
[133:00.36]You see me block that shit?
[133:01.28]Didn't even know it was happening.
[133:02.14]Okay, bye.
[133:05.63]Goodbye.
[133:06.39]I just want to talk to the lady.
[133:09.30]Oh, I picked the worst fucking possible place to jump down from.
[133:31.29]Hey.
[133:33.19]I opened the door.
[133:35.63]What item do I get?
[133:36.81]Prayer bead.
[133:37.22]I just did it.
[133:39.36]Come on.
[133:57.81]Well, now that I'm over here, let me just look around.
[133:59.52]Because there's a bunch of shit that's underneath the water here.
[134:08.32]Oh, I have to rest at an idol, didn't I?
[134:13.01]I need to go... Alright, I have a lot of these scales.
[134:15.79]I have at least eight.
[134:18.69]I gotta go back to the guy, that weird guy in the bucket.
[134:21.84]Remember that dude?
[134:39.31]Holy shit.
[134:44.24]No!
[134:45.16]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[134:49.30]What this two- Why is there one of these guys down here?
[134:52.54]The fucking most hated enemy in the whole game!
[134:55.70]Is that down here?
[135:00.52]Just give me the item!
[135:04.93]Why is he down here?
[135:06.65]Are there two down here?
[135:10.46]I just want everyone to be aware there's two headless in the water down here.
[135:23.43]No, I'll never see the end of that content.
[135:29.02]And I'm fine with that.
[135:34.92]I will never get the 100% steam achievement.
[135:37.56]That's fine.
[135:40.30]I could give a shit less.
[135:43.58]I can't believe these motherfuckers are down there.
[135:53.78]Two!
[135:54.22]There's two!
[135:55.10]Headless two!
[135:56.18]I wish there'd be three.
[136:02.50]Anything else down here?
[136:04.93]Yep.
[136:07.99]That's fucking crazy though.
[136:11.99]They're really not messing around.
[136:16.99]At all.
[136:19.97]Okay, let's go back up.
[136:34.52]I don't think you can drown.
[136:48.44]Anybody else?
[136:49.48]These guys are... Well.
[136:53.19]These aren't the treasure ones.
[136:55.19]Alright, I got all that down here.
[136:59.81]Really?
[137:01.41]That's fine.
[137:01.93]Just... Ah, I almost had it.
[137:19.00]Under here.
[137:19.80]These carps are everywhere.
[137:25.21]I need to go and just see what I can buy.
[137:27.13]A lot of bait.
[137:37.21]A river around here.
[137:38.27]This is so huge.
[137:39.32]It almost feels like a waste if I don't go get everything.
[137:46.48]Oh, forget it.
[137:48.77]This way.
[137:49.75]Alright, I think that's good.
[137:56.21]Maybe one or two more things under these.
[137:58.71]Right here.
[138:07.66]Scrap.
[138:08.26]Good.
[138:14.66]It's just bees.
[138:15.32]They can't get you underwater.
[138:25.58]Ugh!
[138:26.40]Alright, I'm done fishing.
[138:28.08]I got pretty much all the things I wanted.
[138:29.87]Look at all that stuff.
[138:40.29]Even if I die, how much money do I have?
[138:41.75]There's so much.
[138:45.87]Guys, look at these four items here.
[138:54.27]What the fuck is under here?
[138:55.29]Oh, it's just a fish.
[139:04.07]Okay, one, two, three, go.
[139:13.90]Worth it!
[139:15.58]Ooooooooooh!
[139:22.79]Whoa, okay!
[139:25.23]Okay!
[139:27.70]Okay.
[139:29.84]Oh, you have quite a treasure there, and that's a lot for you.
[139:52.77]Sweet.
[139:54.39]So now I've rested.
[139:55.25]Now I should talk to the lady.
[139:57.56]Is this what we're doing?
[140:03.82]That's technically a rest.
[140:08.14]Let's see.
[140:10.70]Lady?
[140:12.86]Hello?
[140:14.80]Front door.
[140:15.36]Did you make it?
[140:28.99]Uh, she's still standing over there.
[140:43.24]No, that's not her.
[140:44.38]That's just a piece of metal.
[140:48.82]Did I run by her?
[140:51.76]Did I just have the blinders on and go right by that lady?
[140:55.97]Really?
[140:56.67]Well, the room is dark.
[140:57.77]It's a pitch black room, and you're telling me that, like, I can't believe you didn't see the lady that's hunched over in the corner?
[141:07.83]You didn't even look?
[141:08.71]Yeah, because I thought she was just... I don't know.
[141:11.66]Okay.
[141:19.78]Guys, why would I know that that was the case here?
[141:25.79]You don't even... Like, look at... Okay.
[141:28.90]Look at this room.
[141:31.06]Those guys were just eating people, so I'm just gonna fucking go this way.
[141:33.96]Like, I... What?
[141:34.96]No, you're blind.
[141:40.04]Shut up.
[141:41.08]Shut up.
[141:41.44]Shut up.
[141:42.34]Shut up.
[141:43.84]Shut up.
[141:45.20]Shut up.
[141:46.27]Shut up.
[141:46.81]Shut up.
[142:10.01]That wasn't even worth doing.
[142:14.55]He didn't give me anything.
[142:18.51]Not even like a little icon popping up?
[142:20.52]Prayer beads?
[142:21.92]No, just dead.
[142:28.50]Now let's turn in the seed.
[142:35.16]Oh, she was stabbing herself in the stomach.
[142:39.29]I thought she was stabbing the body.
[142:42.87]Over and over again.
[142:46.91]I thought she was... She was stabbing the... She was stabbing herself in the chest.
[142:52.49]She wasn't.
[142:53.07]She was stabbing the body.
[142:54.13]Well then, never mind.
[142:55.26]Where's my item?
[143:06.20]How do you know that?
[143:06.84]You didn't see.
[143:17.74]Um, I gotta go.
[143:19.64]That lady goes from place to place.
[143:21.12]She teleports as much as I do.
[143:23.39]How much money do I have?
[143:25.91]I got cash now.
[143:27.87]Hmm, wait.
[143:35.27]What can I do here?
[143:36.00]Oh, here.
[143:36.96]Dragon Spring Sake.
[143:37.86]Give me a story.
[143:39.50]I brought sake.
[143:41.00]Ooh, Dragon Spring?
[143:43.00]That's fine quality sake.
[143:45.32]I'll take it then.
[143:50.61]That really hits the spot.
[143:57.06]I've given all sake to this guy.
[143:59.42]I often drank this with Dogen.
[144:01.98]Emma would keep our cups filled.
[144:04.34]Have you known Lady Emma for long?
[144:06.74]That was a long time ago.
[144:09.53]I found her on a battlefield.
[144:11.71]A battlefield?
[144:12.97]She crept up slowly towards me, her eyes fixed, unwavering on the rice I held in my hand.
[144:20.21]I got some of that, too.
[144:20.89]You want some?
[144:22.35]So I gave it to her.
[144:23.78]Then she just started following me.
[144:26.70]After that... Well, a while later, Ashina became a dangerous place for the both of us.
[144:35.40]Around then, Dogen adopted her as his daughter.
[144:38.72]I suppose it didn't really matter where she ended up.
[144:44.61]One thing's for sure.
[144:46.31]She's happier for the fact she wasn't raised by a shinobi.
[145:02.13]I've never seen this guy's face.
[145:03.23]Is this... That's the person that raised Emma.
[145:15.95]Didn't... And Emma said she was raised by monkeys.
[145:25.86]Yeah.
[145:26.44]Let's go and talk to Emma about her really elaborate, truth-stretching Facebook post.
[145:42.32]Yeah, I was raised by wolves!
[145:45.44]Were you?
[145:54.44]I'm glad you've come, Master Wolf.
[146:02.55]No, you don't get that.
[146:03.31]It's mine.
[146:04.01]Master Wolf, it looks like your brow.
[146:06.15]Yeah, we've heard about my brow.
[146:07.63]Goodbye.
[146:09.46]We're just up here.
[146:10.16]Might as well just get some more dialogue.
[146:11.38]Anything?
[146:14.00]I hope he's alright.
[146:16.26]Oh, Wolf.
[146:18.00]Are you unhurt?
[146:19.16]My lord.
[146:20.21]Ah, this is for you.
[146:23.29]Sweet rice balls!
[146:24.51]A sweet sticky rice ball made by Kuro.
[146:26.71]Slowly grants medium vitality recovery and constant posture recovery over a time.
[146:32.73]Wolf senses it was crafted with feelings of resolve and a reluctance to part ways.
[146:37.47]Okay.
[146:39.64]So this is just a big... Heal over time.
[146:43.14]Yes.
[146:44.66]I'm counting on you, Wolf.
[146:53.72]There's so many items.
[146:58.28]Number held, one and a one.
[146:59.44]I think this is just a one and done.
[147:11.47]Well, thanks for the extra gourd.
[147:19.59]I'm ready.
[147:21.65]Palace Grounds.
[147:25.47]Eat it in front of him.
[147:26.33]Eat it in front of him.
[147:27.69]No, I need that for like a boss fight.
[147:30.91]I'm not just gonna eat that in front of him.
[147:33.65]He's not a boss.
[147:42.48]I gotta go back and... I gotta... Upgrade my stuff.
[147:48.64]I think I have enough materials to do another one.
[147:57.21]Oh, the fat guy that wanted the flower, you're right.
[147:59.99]I have that too.
[148:00.81]Alright, can I upgrade anything here?
[148:12.02]I need more stuff.
[148:14.34]I can't do it yet.
[148:16.76]I need three more gunpowder, which I could buy, and one more of that... Is that iron scrap?
[148:21.89]Let me see, does he sell that?
[148:22.85]Another up.
[148:35.58]He does.
[148:36.52]Okay, I can get that.
[148:38.58]So I need... How many do I need?
[148:39.97]I need three of these, right?
[148:41.17]Let me use my coin purse things.
[148:56.92]So one more of these.
[148:58.64]And then was it two of these that I needed?
[149:00.70]It's two, right?
[149:02.48]Two and then six hundred.
[149:03.52]How much money do I have?
[149:11.49]So now I need to take three of these.
[149:19.46]Let's go upgrade this.
[149:21.42]And then get close to the ultimate firecracker.
[149:33.26]It's a thousand!
[149:34.14]Shit!
[149:34.50]It's a thousand?!
[149:35.86]That's so much.
[149:50.89]Come here.
[149:53.47]So what does this axe do though?
[149:57.89]Is it worth putting on?
[149:58.85]This is pretty deep in here.
[150:01.17]Sparking axe.
[150:03.60]Attach percussion hammer to create flame.
[150:08.31]So, bring a flaming axe down from above to strike an enemy.
[150:10.83]Destroy shields made of wood and create a roar of flames on hit.
[150:16.91]Cool.
[150:17.33]Alright.
[150:18.57]And then purple fume spark.
[150:22.27]There we go.
[150:24.91]Final tier has been revealed.
[150:26.65]It is... Oh, it looks like... Lazulite Axe.
[150:35.17]The hefty last light blade inflicts damage even on guarding enemies.
[150:42.09]It's like the super Minecraft.
[150:46.47]What's this stuff from Minecraft?
[150:50.07]Blue Lapis?
[150:51.05]What's it called?
[150:56.55]What about... What's all the... Oh, man.
[150:59.19]Oh, that's actually not that cool.
[151:02.85]Never mind.
[151:04.50]It's all lazulite.
[151:05.54]No lazulite sparks.
[151:12.12]Phantom kunai.
[151:12.82]All right, so now we need two of an item I have not seen yet.
[151:17.92]It's like some kind of salt.
[151:20.53]And then $1,500.
[151:31.45]I'm going to get rid of this and put on the better axe.
[151:35.91]Sparking axe, better shurikens, and the long spark.
[151:40.66]Combat arts.
[151:43.86]I don't really use this that often, but it's useful sometimes.
[151:47.11]This is the stealth one.
[151:52.03]I'll keep it.
[152:00.13]Can I help you with your essay?
[152:01.12]Um, I don't think you'd want me to do that.
[152:07.06]Uh, I'm gonna buy... I'm gonna buy one of the, uh, yeah.
[152:13.40]I feel like I'm gonna need these.
[152:18.23]Alright, it's time.
[152:26.21]The question is, where... Where is the barrel guy?
[152:32.63]He's over here... I don't remember.
[152:42.10]It's either here or... I think it's here.
[152:49.24]He was very early in the game.
[152:54.52]How early was he, though?
[152:56.70]Oh, here it is.
[152:57.16]This is it, right?
[153:01.81]Please help with the essay.
[153:05.09]No, I don't, I can't.
[153:06.55]Is this it?
[153:12.20]Yeah.
[153:15.34]Help him!
[153:16.76]You don't want my help, you'll get an F. You don't wanna, no, I'll help, fine.
[153:22.08]You want me to help you?
[153:23.16]Listen, here you go, here's the advice.
[153:26.32]Eat a good breakfast tomorrow.
[153:28.54]I'm talking like two eggs, maybe one piece of bacon, some fruit, like a big, like a peach.
[153:35.28]Sit on the couch for like 30 minutes, digest it, make it get into your bloodstream, into your brain for brain power.
[153:40.82]And then start.
[153:45.07]That's my advice.
[153:47.65]You need good brain power to do anything.
[153:51.24]Like, for instance, today.
[153:52.92]Good quality brain power food.
[153:54.85]You've got to feed your brain.
[153:56.03]Your brain is the most important organ.
[153:58.89]It takes from any of the foods you eat.
[154:01.55]How do you think you can, like, think?
[154:03.21]Is you need good, high quality foods.
[154:05.79]So I went to Burger King today and had a double Whopper and two large fries.
[154:13.29]I almost shit my pants before the stream.
[154:26.95]I had so much time.
[154:27.81]I just fucked it up.
[154:29.81]Oh, I need to look around.
[154:33.69]Because there's got to be something under here.
[154:35.33]Why would there not be something here?
[154:37.70]The essay's due tonight.
[154:42.38]Well, why did you wait so long?
[154:45.98]You should have done it earlier.
[154:46.99]All right.
[154:55.66]Purchase item.
[154:56.24]So I have 13.
[154:59.21]Floating Passage.
[155:00.43]This is 5.
[155:01.27]7 for the Masked Fragment.
[155:05.13]Divine Grass!
[155:06.21]Does he have more than one of these?
[155:07.23]I'll just buy 13 of these!
[155:18.72]Skill unlocked upon requiring this item.
[155:20.92]Unleash attacks in a flowing, dance-like form, overwhelming enemies in a fury of graceful aggression.
[155:27.72]This technique belongs to the Ashina Sword School, though it has been deemed heretical due to its foreign origin.
[155:33.83]Red Gourd.
[155:38.49]Reduces burn buildup and slightly increases burn resistance.
[155:42.83]It cannot heal the burn status Abnormality, however.
[155:46.17]Okay.
[155:47.94]That sounds pretty good.
[155:48.60]So this is just another drink.
[155:50.08]How many?
[155:50.32]Does it get five uses?
[155:53.78]Oh, damn.
[155:56.06]Give me that.
[155:58.94]There's like three of these pieces.
[156:00.30]I don't know if I'm going to be able to get all these.
[156:02.96]I'm not sure if it's worth buying this.
[156:10.11]How many pieces do I need?
[156:11.03]Like two, three, four?
[156:15.55]Mask fragment right.
[156:16.95]I mean, I have the money.
[156:19.61]There's three pieces.
[156:22.69]It's really useful, but I don't even know where to even start for that.
[156:26.07]I know I saw the other one, but there's apparently another one somewhere.
[156:33.77]How many of these does he have?
[156:37.67]He only had one.
[156:38.29]Okay, well that's worth it.
[156:46.49]Well, I got the useful stuff.
[156:49.85]But I know where it is, right?
[156:53.03]I know it's here.
[156:53.67]I want to become a car.
[157:01.74]A giant car.
[157:09.77]You want to be the fish?
[157:12.43]Holy shit.
[157:13.75]Great Canadian fuck club.
[157:15.42]20 community subs.
[157:20.02]20 community subs from Great Canadian.
[157:22.28]Oh my god.
[157:25.00]That's a shitload of subs.
[157:30.01]That is a shitload of subs.
[157:36.67]Thank you.
[157:46.69]Damn.
[157:48.71]What a great Canadian.
[157:51.66]So you go... That's actually really good.
[158:01.68]That comes up quick.
[158:06.69]I like this better than the other thing.
[158:08.27]The other thing it has is slow.
[158:10.22]You could, like, do a dodge or, like, dodge around and bang.
[158:15.10]And then get out.
[158:19.80]Maybe I'll try it.
[158:22.21]Hey there.
[158:22.87]Want me to just kill this guy?
[158:24.07]No, I'm just kidding.
[158:26.51]Cool.
[158:26.79]So I have the gourd now.
[158:28.17]Let's see.
[158:33.66]Reduces burn buildup.
[158:38.01]So, I feel like I should have had this a long time ago.
[158:41.97]There's been at least three or four bosses that were fire-based.
[158:45.72]I hope this is still worth using, because it took me a long time to get it.
[158:49.06]717 subs.
[159:01.35]Yeah.
[159:07.97]You guys remember when we were talking like a few months ago or two months ago, three months ago about crossing like the thousands of subs that are on this channel?
[159:22.26]Yeah.
[159:24.70]GreyCanadian has and had more than that, I think, earlier.
[159:28.50]That's a shitload of money.
[159:39.88]Alright, let's go.
[159:41.86]Time to fight.
[159:44.63]No one actually is subscribing.
[159:46.11]He's just giving everybody subs.
[159:50.73]That wouldn't be that surprising.
[159:53.85]And here comes Kairotobi with 10.
[159:55.09]217 from Kairotobi.
[159:58.20]A lot of... 1-7.
[159:58.48]7-1-7.
[159:58.54]2-1-7.
[159:58.62]Interesting.
[160:14.74]Got any tips for the Genichiro fight?
[160:17.92]I'm about to lose my fucking mind with how hard it is.
[160:22.11]Um... Honestly, with... Okay, uh... Splarg, five community subs.
[160:27.17]Thanks a lot.
[160:27.89]Thank you, Splarg.
[160:28.45]Um... I'll tell you, with all the fights that are on the boss platform... It's...
[160:39.83]I've read a lot of people talking about, be aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, go in and go hard.
[160:45.64]I'm not sure I agree.
[160:47.82]At least for the fights that are up there.
[160:50.80]I like to take a more parry, learn their moves and just kind of block, block, block, parry, parry, parry, parry.
[160:58.12]Sometimes when you go in, you can cross your brain up with whether to swing or to block or to parry.
[161:07.41]The deflect is so useful and it's so good that it's, I think, at least on some of the fights where you fight a guy with a sword to try and get the parry down for the moves.
[161:20.33]And then there was another thing.
[161:21.81]Bebrahim gave 10 community subs.
[161:25.87]10 subs, 20 subs, 5 subs, 25, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5 from Freudian Weapon.
[161:34.23]Are you guys trying to put me in another tax bracket?
[161:37.57]Holy shit.
[161:44.74]Here's the door.
[161:48.58]Thank you for the tons of community subs, guys.
[161:52.08]I have a feeling this is a boss.
[161:53.04]Let's see what it is.
[161:56.30]Maybe not.
[162:04.55]Another zone.
[162:05.71]I'm gonna sneeze, I think.
[162:08.60]Yeah, but ooh.
[162:12.24]Item.
[162:13.52]Let's just get it.
[162:14.84]It is right here.
[162:15.44]I need to use these.
[162:26.11]I just never have the opportunity to go and do it.
[162:31.71]Dude, if I could make a script.
[162:33.03]Whoa.
[162:36.40]If I could have a script that would automatically activate one of those, every, like, 30 minutes I would have it work.
[162:44.93]It's something like hanging out in a tree.
[162:52.31]What is it?
[162:56.82]Oh, it's just a- it's just a lizard.
[163:02.64]Uh, thank you, Jiber!
[163:05.04]Jiber is seven.
[163:07.15]Five more community subs.
[163:10.63]Sub train.
[163:11.31]After sub train.
[163:11.99]After sub train.
[163:12.66]Sub, sub, subs.
[163:13.50]I like this little spot, though.
[163:21.26]He was just chilling.
[163:22.10]Yeah, but look.
[163:22.86]His anger meter is there.
[163:24.06]Maybe go up?
[163:32.19]Maybe?
[163:32.43]Because back up here is the...
[163:40.40]I guess we're going this way.
[163:41.66]Dear Meaty, five community subs.
[163:46.63]Thank you guys.
[163:47.51]Five more.
[163:48.11]Looks like I can get up there.
[164:03.18]So many subscriptions.
[164:13.86]Come on, I can't reach that.
[164:15.32]Jump from tree to tree, maybe?
[164:17.88]The Zinger Slinger.
[164:19.10]Five community subs.
[164:21.98]Subs, subs, even more of them.
[164:25.12]They just don't stop coming.
[164:27.82]They are just here.
[164:29.86]Forever.
[164:31.40]Sub train.
[164:32.50]Forever.
[164:34.26]Thank you, Zinger Slinger.
[164:37.70]Alright.
[164:40.02]Is that an enemy, or is it just somebody angry that I'm coming up here?
[164:49.43]Oh, somebody's just powering up.
[164:50.86]Spliceable Spleen.
[164:52.02]Five community subs.
[164:54.08]Thank you.
[164:58.16]Subs.
[164:59.68]Holy shit.
[165:00.62]Alright.
[165:03.04]I'm... That's too many.
[165:04.46]Too... Too many lightning bolts.
[165:08.96]You didn't even do it.
[165:12.93]Oh my fucking god.
[165:15.65]No, stop!
[165:16.43]Just...
[165:20.17]I gotta pull you down here.
[165:32.70]Get it!
[165:33.96]Oh my god!
[165:34.88]Die!
[165:35.40]Honest to god, I can't believe that guy's still alive.
[165:44.10]I'm shocked.
[165:51.77]Damn it!
[165:52.33]No!
[166:03.03]Damn it.
[166:03.63]Oh my goodness, these guys are so irritating.
[166:06.79]Ah, Krusty!
[166:07.73]Thank you, Krusty, for five community subs.
[166:11.15]Look at the health.
[166:11.73]Like, give me a break.
[166:21.12]I feel like I'm not doing even remotely enough damage right now.
[166:23.94]How?
[166:24.50]I just upgraded my sword.
[166:26.06]What?
[166:28.02]That feels so wrong.
[166:37.54]I- I even- You just can't- Fucking god, come on!
[166:48.13]Why?
[166:51.46]I'm not using the other resurrect.
[166:52.76]If only it didn't do, like, 80% of my health.
[167:14.93]Alright, let's go.
[167:29.67]It's just hard to deal with more than one enemy.
[167:32.55]When you fight more than one person, you just... It's just fucking chaos.
[167:39.97]Can I go around this way and kill one of them?
[167:43.68]Dealing with two of them, or three of them at the same time.
[167:45.68]It's just, that's not gonna happen.
[167:50.30]I guess not.
[167:51.22]You just have to do it.
[168:02.07]Well, I got another one of these.
[168:31.06]I wanted to fire it up the way.
[168:45.34]Damn it!
[168:58.72]This is such a MASSIVE delay.
[169:01.60]WHAAAAAAAAT?
[169:04.90]Yeah, delay that.
[169:09.41]Just jump in the air and hover there for four straight seconds.
[169:13.37]What the fuck just hit me?
[169:16.67]What?
[169:17.58]Where?
[169:17.88]Where are you?
[169:21.20]Huh?
[169:27.40]You all the way down there and you hit me from... I don't know what kind of weird magic dog shit.
[169:32.60]How did you do that?
[169:35.38]What?
[169:38.49]Why is there an idol here?
[169:49.15]That was like an idol not even 500 feet from an idol.
[169:57.88]God, screwy game, screwy stuff.
[170:23.87]Hold on, let me read the message here.
[170:28.57]Try backstab.
[170:29.65]Hole.
[170:31.73]Right?
[170:32.17]Right, guys?
[170:34.37]Oh, they're dead.
[170:34.79]Never mind.
[170:37.81]Sorry, never mind.
[170:39.17]Should I pray?
[170:51.20]Right?
[170:51.50]This is a Dark Souls game.
[170:52.28]You have to write the funny line everywhere.
[170:54.80]Behind every enemy.
[170:55.90]Behind every person.
[171:03.94]Is there an enemy that's facing over a balcony?
[171:05.66]There's just a standard enemy.
[171:07.93]It better be there.
[171:23.90]This is coming from the man who talks about diapers and puke every stream.
[171:30.06]Hold on.
[171:31.06]Just wait.
[171:31.61]I gotta defend myself on that one.
[171:37.37]I'm not writing it down and putting it in front of every enemy.
[171:40.95]I don't go behind every enemy in the game and say, look at his diaper!
[171:46.30]Every enemy, every NPC.
[171:51.64]I don't do that.
[171:52.30]Alright, what the hell is this?
[171:55.36]This is like... Oh god.
[171:59.86]This is clearly a boss.
[172:08.56]Oh, dragons of the... Oh, god.
[172:12.64]They're just gonna cough on me.
[172:16.51]No, no.
[172:17.09]It's like being at PAX.
[172:18.77]I don't want to be.
[172:19.35]It's like going on an airplane.
[172:27.45]Ugh.
[172:29.06]Well, okay.
[172:32.50]They're just, like, puking.
[172:34.82]Alright, let's go ahead and put on the antidote.
[172:49.10]Yeah, From Software has such a massive, MASSIVE, MASSIVE hard-on.
[172:55.28]For fight, like, a hundred of the same enemy in a boss fight.
[172:59.52]Really.
[173:02.61]Bloodborne, it was the spider boss.
[173:04.63]Deacons, like, why do they have to do this?
[173:17.24]I wonder if there's something I can do.
[173:18.26]Let's see, hold on.
[173:18.82]I mean, that's kind of, that actually is pretty effective.
[173:22.76]Then I'm gonna get the point.
[173:24.82]What else do I have here?
[173:27.32]What the fuck?
[173:29.16]Oh no.
[173:34.19]Do I fight it?
[173:35.53]Do I fight the tree?
[173:36.53]I don't know.
[173:43.67]Ooh, that's actually pretty good.
[173:51.65]I'm poisoned.
[173:59.19]No, it's not worth it.
[174:05.99]It takes too long.
[174:11.89]Can I, like, hurt the tree?
[174:19.41]No.
[174:24.28]Get back bread and butter.
[174:43.92]Use Axe on Tree like in Minecraft.
[175:00.34]Wait, what's this?
[175:02.48]That was a different one.
[175:11.39]That one's different!
[175:12.49]Is this just the Deacons?
[175:40.49]What the fuck was that?
[175:50.54]Alright, I can... Can we really come out this time?
[176:01.89]This can't be it, right?
[176:17.67]I mean, that's satisfying to do, but... Alright, that's it.
[176:31.15]Is that it?
[176:34.68]No, of course that's not it.
[176:42.37]I can't wait to fight the real boss and then have to do that what I just did again because I'm gonna get killed by the guy that swings like 300 times a second because he's like one of the later game bosses.
[176:52.44]They're gonna all transform into a fucking monster or something.
[177:02.76]All right.
[177:06.73]Let's see if I can get this done.
[177:10.96]I'm gonna have to take a break after this.
[177:11.91]I'm gonna lose.
[177:13.83]I gotta grab another drink.
[177:21.07]Oh, man.
[177:22.25]That's so cool.
[177:30.20]Wow.
[177:30.28]Oh, Divine Dragon.
[177:31.60]Okay, so...
[177:40.93]That's a sweep.
[177:42.03]That's just a big sweep.
[177:45.41]What else do you do?
[177:46.11]Okay, I guess I can go like this.
[177:49.47]Ow, that hurt.
[177:50.09]I wonder if I can trip.
[177:59.95]So he's... Okay, he strikes you with lightning, and then you strike... Oh god, where's he going?
[178:03.81]Oh my god, what the fuck is he doing?
[178:09.88]Wow.
[178:11.71]Wow, this is really cool.
[178:21.61]I love this fight.
[178:22.69]Holy shit, that hurt.
[178:25.30]I'm gonna die.
[178:35.16]Bang.
[178:37.28]Okay.
[178:40.57]Oh, fuck!
[178:43.03]I gotta wait longer than that.
[178:48.77]Damn.
[178:49.37]Maybe I should just jump around to the trees.
[179:04.77]I can't.
[179:07.27]You wait, I can parry the sword?
[179:09.63]He's- I'm so far away!
[179:11.01]That seems like I shouldn't be able to do that.
[179:19.58]It's kind of delayed.
[179:37.02]I'm gonna do it again Lightning?
[179:44.03]Nope.
[179:44.57]Grab it, grab it!
[179:45.43]Aww Alright Fuck.
[180:00.27]I'm dead
[180:08.30]I mean, when does he do the electricity?
[180:17.68]Alright, well, hold on.
[180:22.03]I... Oh, right.
[180:24.09]Okay, so... Let's just do that again.
[180:27.29]And... Again... Alright, well that makes it a little easier, knowing that.
[180:36.83]Okay.
[180:42.09]Oh god, I don't die here.
[180:49.11]Give me some more trees.
[180:59.88]Tree!
[181:00.20]Give me a tree!
[181:03.88]Holy shit, what the fuck?
[181:07.26]What the fuck?
[181:08.16]Where's the trees?
[181:12.89]Oh my god.
[181:20.93]So, alright.
[181:22.01]That fight is a total joke.
[181:24.67]And then he randomly just goes crazy for like 10 straight seconds.
[181:27.81]Okay.
[181:30.35]Well, now I gotta do the deacons again.
[181:40.84]It's just a cinematic boss.
[181:42.86]Died to the cinematic boss.
[181:44.94]Who gives a shit?
[181:46.18]It's the first time I've even seen it.
[181:49.20]I can't believe you didn't beat that.
[181:51.38]I mean, like, this is the first time you've ever seen this.
[181:54.16]How did you not know that?
[181:55.40]I can't... No, you should have known that you need to jump on the tree.
[182:00.17]Were you, like, looking at the boss and how cool the boss was?
[182:03.01]You didn't beat it the first fucking try like you did the last three bosses?
[182:06.23]I'm on something...
[182:23.83]No, do it!
[182:33.00]What, why did I fall off?
[182:35.46]Oh, it disappeared.
[182:53.63]Hi.
[182:53.87]Alright, let's do this again.
[183:04.49]That's really not even that bad.
[183:07.41]Hi, King!
[183:07.87]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[183:08.87]Alright, here we go.
[183:13.39]Lightning trees, and then he goes crazy.
[183:15.84]This is so cool.
[183:16.50]It really is an awesome fight.
[183:24.37]That still hit me?
[183:24.85]Alright, which one's lit up?
[183:30.09]None of them so far?
[183:33.95]Fly around!
[183:34.51]Which one?
[183:53.89]He's gonna knock me back here.
[184:02.60]Hello.
[184:04.34]Hello.
[184:06.43]I see it!
[184:10.97]What the fuck are you doing, game?
[184:25.93]Oh, shit.
[184:26.74]He was ducking.
[184:27.36]Oh, god.
[184:35.34]Oh, god damn it.
[184:36.14]I thought it was just gonna go right into his body.
[184:37.93]Alright, here it comes.
[184:43.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[184:46.15]Does lock on?
[184:46.73]It doesn't matter.
[184:47.63]He can go under it.
[184:57.98]All right, go.
[185:09.59]Any more?
[185:10.01]Over there.
[185:19.67]Here we go.
[185:20.75]Time for him to do a bunch of stupid moves.
[185:27.35]Let's do it!
[185:37.42]Come on!
[185:49.49]What do you got?
[185:53.91]Oh, I was trying to...
[185:55.81]I was trying to parry it.
[185:57.25]Fuck, man.
[186:01.89]Alright, here are the trees.
[186:03.33]I win.
[186:09.76]What?
[186:11.18]Whoa!
[186:14.56]Is he alive?
[186:17.72]What's that?
[186:18.00]Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[186:20.42]Grab it!
[186:25.33]Oh shit, okay.

[186:37.27]Gracious gift of tears.
[186:46.62]I kind of feel bad.
[186:53.00]Well, that was definitely the coolest boss fight.
[186:58.44]Divine Dragon.
[187:00.94]Convene with a sculptor's idol and confront memories of a battle to permanently increase attack power.

[187:30.57]I've been curing it.
[187:31.53]The key to the secret passage that leads out of Ashina Castle.
[187:34.55]The secret passage can be found at the end of the moat in the Ashina Reservoir, not far from the Moonview Tower.
[188:02.00]So this is the same place we were at the beginning of the game?
[188:05.48]Yes, Master Wolf.
[188:08.57]The secret passage can be found along the moat in the Ashina Reservoir.
[188:13.79]Okay, so I have the key.

[193:04.24]Alright, so.
[193:06.56]Let me... Do I have... I have the beads, alright.
[193:11.12]Divine Dragon Attack Power Plus.
[193:14.40]You hear that?

[193:21.35]I didn't even read it.
[193:22.89]Whatever.
[193:23.17]I gotta go read that.
[193:26.49]I'm interested in the lore.
[193:35.43]Where is it?
[193:38.12]The Divine Dragon of the Everblossom came from the West long ago, eventually making its way to this land.
[193:47.86]I got it.
[193:49.61]Some parts of Ashina are exceedingly old.
[193:51.40]Water coursing through her ancient rocks and soil allowed the dragon to take root.
[193:55.74]Okay.
[193:56.50]Cool.
[194:02.68]Alright, so I'm, uh... I'm looking over at the chat and I'm getting spammed.
[194:08.96]Just spammed.

[194:12.89]Don't!
[194:14.65]Don't go there!
[194:16.01]Wait!
[194:17.73]Wait!
[194:19.95]So what do you want me to do?
[194:25.61]Is it apparently an optional area?
[194:35.90]From where?
[194:42.07]Just like from here.
[194:53.61]There's a kite.
[195:00.47]Okay.
[195:05.75]This is the dungeon.
[195:07.13]All these are locked up again.
[195:08.21]So from the dungeon entrance?
[195:19.76]No.
[195:23.04]It's just from here.
[195:26.18]No way!
[195:26.72]Don't!
[195:36.19]Can I get out this way?
[195:36.91]No, there's another window, right?
[195:40.69]Let me rest first.
[195:43.90]Turn on smart clicks.
[195:50.58]There's an idol up there.
[195:51.60]All right, here we go.
[195:53.56]There's a door.

[196:27.06]Oh look!
[196:29.84]I found the thing that people were yelling about.
[196:31.98]And screaming.
[196:34.52]My ears are bleeding.
[196:36.36]Because of how loud the screams were.
[196:45.97]So it's down there.
[196:49.41]Heeeeyo!
[196:52.65]Just wait for them to fight.
[196:53.61]You kill each other, I don't care.
[197:02.64]Why are they fighting each other?
[197:09.46]Alright, well, I don't know if I wanted you to win or not.
[197:20.17]Okay.
[197:21.39]So... Did I... was I supposed to hold on to it?

[198:42.01]Wait, what?
[198:47.00]Alright, whatever.
[198:55.74]You're killing him.
[198:56.68]Stop.
[198:59.34]Alright, I've had enough.
[199:04.51]I've had just about enough.
[199:28.48]Nice!

[199:30.34]It's a fair!
[199:30.88]There's a guy shooting me!

[199:54.89]Hope you have a good one.
[200:01.33]Mystery dowsing powder.
[200:03.69]It heals burn status.
[200:04.81]Burn, burn, burn, burn.
[200:05.99]Fire, fire, fire, fire.

[200:16.58]Remember we talked about how I need a fire thing?
[200:18.48]Well, good thing I have it.
[200:22.54]Okay.
[200:49.06]Fuck, man.
[200:49.74]Guys with the two blades.
[201:03.66]Really?
[201:04.72]Really?
[201:05.32]Like, what?
[201:06.12]I... Why do you have a trillion posture?
[201:20.41]Like, you have a MILLION posture.
[201:23.57]I gotta bring your health down to something.
[201:24.85]Like, this is fucking ridiculous.
[201:30.91]Look at my posture.
[201:33.22]This is the fucking hardest enemy in the game.
[201:37.35]They should upgrade you to boss.
[201:42.37]Fuck off.
[202:01.39]Alright, there's a big guy down here.
[202:03.09]There's... Oh no, another one of these goddamn dual welders.
[202:09.13]They're the bane of my existence.
[202:17.74]Alright, you had your friend, or your brother, or your colleague.
[202:21.58]I don't even know who the fuck it was.
[202:24.12]Compare the two of you.
[202:25.46]You don't deserve to be down there.
[202:29.74]Oh man.
[202:33.47]Alright, well.
[202:35.87]Grab.
[202:40.95]Interesting.
[202:45.10]Drinking?
[202:48.64]That's a slo- ah, that's a slo- I thought it was a grab.
[203:22.38]Stop spamming block.
[203:25.06]I need to know what he's doing.
[203:26.96]You want me just to let him hit me?
[203:30.26]Or do you want me to block and see what he does for moves?
[203:32.02]I'll just let him hit me.
[203:34.16]That sounds good.
[203:49.54]Fuck.
[203:51.18]Oh, this is gonna be painful.
[204:00.69]Cause I gotta go through that whole goddamn camp again.
[204:08.34]I gotta go through this whole... I can't... Can I just sneak in here?
[204:10.78]Oh, shit.
[204:16.17]This is gonna be awful.
[204:17.43]I gotta go through this whole thing again.
[204:18.73]I wonder what happened.
[204:27.89]Okay, wait, hold on.
[204:28.75]Can I, like, listen to you talk now?
[204:31.69]I'm still a Shino... Okay, whatever.
[204:42.34]I wonder if I can find a way to get around here without having to do this every time.
[204:45.18]I'm not in the right place.
[204:57.30]Well, I wonder.
[204:58.34]Is the entire camp going to follow me?
[204:59.83]Let's see.
[205:00.79]Let's see how great this area is.
[205:02.35]I'm going to aggro the whole camp.
[205:07.19]It's waiting for me?
[205:15.37]Oh, that's not gonna work out.
[205:16.71]No way.
[205:18.35]Oh, no way.
[205:19.07]There's no way.
[205:19.85]You have to kill everybody here.
[205:26.80]What if I just run by everybody?
[205:33.81]What else is here?
[205:34.51]Is there something else here?
[205:40.96]Uh, I guess this... I don't have to do this.
[205:47.38]That doesn't open... Yeah, I remember this area, the pan guy.
[205:56.16]Uh... I'm gonna just see what's over here.
[206:06.47]Oh, shit!
[206:06.99]Okay, that's... I need that item.
[206:14.43]Oh my god, Jesus Christ!
[206:20.21]This is crazy!
[206:21.47]Wait, there's an idol up there!
[206:22.75]Get up there, come on!
[206:25.49]Oh my god!
[206:26.27]I can do it.
[206:32.81]And I fell off somehow.
[206:37.25]No wonder this is an optional area.
[206:47.32]I didn't... How the fuck am I supposed to know you're up here?
[206:50.90]Where is this... Why am I locked onto this guy?
[207:04.24]Oh, fuck this place.
[207:20.29]Okay.
[207:21.35]Uh... So... What the fuck am I supposed to do now?
[207:32.93]Well, I didn't mean to do that.
[207:36.81]Well, that was... Alright, I can go this way.
[207:56.70]Uhhh, that's not an item.
[208:33.28]Wait, where?
[208:36.08]Oh god, where did you come from?
[208:40.01]Okay.
[208:52.39]That wasn't terrible, but... Oh, there's a lot over here, huh?
[209:07.30]One guy on the road.
[209:18.95]I look over here.
[209:20.17]Jeremiah, I think you're making great progress.
[209:21.59]The tutorial boss can be challenging.
[209:23.35]Take your time and have fun with the game.
[209:24.61]I'm glad you're trying out your first Soulsborne game.
[209:29.49]We're still on?
[209:30.37]Alright, now you got me all fucked up.
[209:32.46]Because I had to read that.
[209:35.83]Oh, god damn it.
[209:40.55]I fucked it all up, you guys.
[209:41.93]Alright, I'm never reading chat ever again.
[209:50.73]Look at the whole fucking village after me now.
[209:59.31]Oh, man.
[210:00.29]Oh, this nowhere is safe.
[210:08.54]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[210:11.58]Oh, my God!
[210:12.34]There's a chest!
[210:14.43]No!
[210:14.85]Nowhere safe!
[210:15.71]Nowhere safe.
[210:19.09]Whoa!
[210:22.68]Oh, no way!
[210:33.03]Oh, is there a chained ogre here?
[210:35.75]Are you sure they're not just spawning in random enemies in this zone?
[210:40.44]That guy didn't even try to fight me.
[210:41.74]He's just fucking walking around.
[210:46.24]That guy didn't even try to fight me.
[210:53.32]This is just an optional war zone.
[210:55.26]I don't know where I'm going.
[211:04.55]Um, it's in there?
[211:06.73]What is in there?
[211:07.33]This is where I fought the bull, right?
[211:13.94]Oh my god, wait, there's an idol right here.
[211:21.18]What?
[211:21.35]Wait, where am I going?
[211:27.45]Wait, what the fuck is going on?
[211:41.42]There's random enemies in here.
[211:44.26]There's a random monster in here.
[211:46.85]Demon of hatred.
[212:14.45]He's got three bars.
[212:16.35]Oh boy, here we go.
[212:19.03]All right.
[212:21.35]You look like a Dark Souls, Soulsborne boss.
[212:25.18]What do you got?
[212:26.96]That's pretty good.
[212:29.16]You got a firearm.
[212:30.82]Okay, I get you in the hand.
[212:42.79]I don't know if I want to parry his fire, like, squirrelly arm.
[212:48.22]You gotta know.
[213:02.91]That's classified as a sweep.
[213:07.17]Holy shit.
[213:07.67]What the hell am I supposed to do about that?
[213:24.48]I wonder if I should just dodge.
[213:26.84]Probably not, though.
[213:34.07]Well, I can grab him.
[213:36.51]Show me your moves, please.
[213:37.85]I want to see them go.
[213:39.31]Alright, well, I'm dead.
[213:45.77]Good thing there's an idol right here.
[214:01.05]Wow, that's an enormous hitbox.
[214:04.08]Holy shit.
[214:11.55]Oh my goodness gracious.
[214:12.71]Okay, well, a couple things that are very clear here.
[214:23.27]No, this is only magnetic.
[214:24.94]I thought it was red, so it was... no.
[214:28.90]Uh... Fire Gourd.
[214:31.30]There is it.
[214:32.58]Reduces burn buildup.
[214:34.98]I'm just gonna drink it whenever it's available, right?
[214:37.15]Let me try it.
[214:42.37]Let me just get... let me just see it again.
[214:56.61]Let me fight you like a... Let me fight you like a fucking Dark Souls boss.
[215:01.09]Probably not.
[215:03.03]Never mind.
[215:06.73]Jesus!
[215:07.39]He just doesn't... Wow!
[215:09.11]Wow!
[215:24.96]That was a one hit kill.
[215:29.03]Oh my goodness.
[215:34.11]That, look at that hitbox.
[215:36.76]Did you see how big that hitbox was?
[215:38.34]There could have been seven of us lined up there.
[215:52.09]Hey, this is the only... Let's just keep getting our ass kicked.
[215:54.99]Let's go.
[216:01.35]Let's try to take it slow this time.
[216:12.12]No way.
[216:12.74]You gotta run underneath that.
[216:14.52]Once he queues up that, you gotta just run.
[216:16.63]Oh boy.
[216:20.96]The arm is so weird because it's so squiggly.
[216:24.40]It's hard to tell when he's even swinging at you.
[216:26.82]It's like he's got a rubber band arm.
[216:31.76]That's the problem, man.
[216:33.04]Look at this thing.
[216:42.34]Maybe I'm just gonna run behind him to stay all the way behind him.
[216:47.78]Don't even let him give him a chance to, like, touch you.
[216:50.16]He's gonna try to do it, but can I get in there quickly?
[216:52.36]Can't go through his legs.
[216:54.44]What is this?
[216:54.94]Jesus.
[216:55.32]Ho ho ho.
[216:55.88]Ho ho ho.
[217:19.45]Damn.
[217:19.87]Alright, I'm gonna... This is crazy.
[217:27.64]Alright, let's go.
[217:33.90]Yeah, you gotta just run.
[217:36.18]You gotta stay with him.
[217:38.43]Don't let him even run remotely the fuck away.
[217:43.63]Like that.
[217:44.03]Not good.
[217:44.63]Come on, I can't attach to him?
[217:49.58]See, when he gets in front of you, that's like the worst part.
[217:51.44]You gotta stay with him.
[217:53.40]Jesus.
[217:59.73]He gets so much range on you and then it's like silly spring armor.
[218:02.37]See you later.
[218:06.33]Fuck, there's gotta be a way I can get that fucker, right?
[218:10.01]Guess not.
[218:12.85]What the fuck are you supposed to do against those?
[218:17.19]Holy shit!
[218:18.07]They take up, like, a whole screen!
[218:27.48]Don't hit me.
[218:35.04]Go again.
[218:40.51]Jesus!
[218:41.35]Run straight through, I'm thinking.
[218:50.35]But I'm thinking run straight through those.
[218:51.81]I got cocky there for no reason.
[218:55.29]Alright, run straight.
[219:00.68]He's gonna throw the fireballs.
[219:01.82]I think I can go right underneath them.
[219:04.46]Yup.
[219:05.60]Alright, it's just figuring it out.
[219:07.58]It's just figuring that shit out.
[219:22.02]Go again.
[219:24.50]Oh yeah.
[219:28.44]At least I didn't get hit.
[219:36.16]Alright, first phase is kind of... I'm figuring this shit out.
[219:48.03]Ooh, that hurts a lot.
[219:50.37]Damn it.
[219:51.27]Oh my god, that does so much damage.
[219:54.74]That's like almost 80% of your whole health bar.
[219:57.24]Fuck.
[219:58.70]Ugh.
[220:06.81]Oof.
[220:08.49]Slowly but surely, I'm figuring it out, you know what I mean?
[220:15.29]Let's get an actual attempt with me not getting hit by fireballs.
[220:19.15]That's a big deal.
[220:37.15]Here comes fireballs.
[220:46.66]Ooh, that was quick.
[220:53.58]Oh, fuck.
[220:54.16]I thought it was a little bit longer than that.
[220:55.70]That's alright.
[220:56.22]That was fast, huh?
[220:59.18]Yeah, I was fucked there.
[221:01.24]So I thought, in my brain, when he does the belly flop, I thought maybe I could hold on to it.
[221:06.06]Because I got hit by the fire last time.
[221:08.30]It still hit me.
[221:14.69]That right there.
[221:15.59]That right there.
[221:16.31]That.
[221:17.79]That little like WHIP!
[221:19.04]He does like a tiny little jab and it's a massive fucking awful thing you have to avoid.
[221:28.42]If I'm gonna try to stay next to that leg... Then I gotta be ready to dodge straight through that.
[221:53.06]Oh, this is a bad place to be.
[222:02.74]I couldn't pick a worse place to be right now.
[222:06.46]Of course he goes all the way back here.
[222:08.14]Like, look at him.
[222:08.54]He's stuck in the fucking corner.
[222:09.48]Like, get out of here.
[222:10.38]Like, why?
[222:11.34]Get the fuck out of there.
[222:13.12]Because if I... I have to run over there to make him do anything.
[222:15.69]And now he's going to throw the fire at me.
[222:20.88]It's such a huge open area, how do you get stuck in the wall?
[222:25.18]This is the biggest area of any Souls game.
[222:28.22]Besides maybe Orphan.
[222:30.92]And you go into the corner.
[222:41.34]Really?
[222:42.68]Okay, I'm dead.
[222:57.82]Oh, my goodness.
[223:09.27]Two steps.
[223:14.15]That's a scary ball.
[223:39.22]There we go.
[223:45.42]Oh.
[223:45.50]No, get me the fuck out of here.
[223:46.40]No corner, no corner, no corner, corner, corner.
[223:48.10]Here it comes.
[223:52.25]See?
[223:52.59]I get to jump twice.
[224:01.89]There it is.
[224:03.15]He does it twice, and a step.
[224:04.81]Ugh.
[224:06.40]Damn, he does like four moves in a row there.
[224:12.55]Oh boy, this fucking silly string!
[224:15.87]Oh my god, please!
[224:20.42]Dude, I don't even know what the fuck he's even doing for moves.
[224:24.62]He's kind of just ripping his body in circles.
[224:27.26]And his arm is doing the rest of the work.
[224:31.86]Not very good telegraphs.
[224:33.00]What is this?
[224:37.21]Well, I got him down to as low as I've got him ever.
[224:56.31]Jesus, no!
[225:06.57]It's that, it's the close swipe, it is.
[225:10.44]Oh, somebody died.
[225:11.12]That's gonna happen, man.
[225:11.92]This is, this boss has got, I got three phases with this dude.
[225:24.19]Let me see if I can just get... I want to try to get him down to one.
[225:26.39]Let's see what he does in the next phase.
[225:28.60]I'll get him here.
[225:29.24]Let's go.
[225:39.57]Into the corner again.
[225:40.41]You dick.
[225:50.67]I wonder when you have... Okay, when you get a certain amount of range, he does that crazy moveset there.
[226:07.70]Not into the corner again.
[226:08.90]God, what's this?
[226:09.60]What's my luck?
[226:10.76]Come on.
[226:15.72]Back it up.
[226:16.22]I ain't gonna have that happen.
[226:19.03]Oh fuck, I thought he was throwing the balls.
[226:21.75]Fuck!
[226:31.14]Oh my god.
[226:31.94]Of course he does it there.
[226:50.19]Really?
[226:51.79]No way!
[226:53.09]That's the first time that's happened.
[226:54.51]It's because I was coming down an incline.
[226:59.24]Oh my lord.
[226:59.96]It's because I was going down an incline.
[227:09.05]Yeah.
[227:10.73]Fuck.
[227:14.23]Alright, one more try.
[227:15.59]And then I'm gonna go... Come back.
[227:19.27]I want new items.
[227:25.09]I still got hit by it.
[227:26.43]Oh, that's... Like, what?
[227:28.27]Really?
[227:28.63]I still get hit by that?
[227:30.85]What was that?
[227:31.29]It was like a two second residual hitbox?
[227:35.86]Who let you...
[227:42.95]This guy may as well be hitting me with a fucking giant square.
[227:46.17]He's got a giant flaming square on his hand.
[228:08.16]Oh.
[228:18.66]There it is.
[228:19.72]There's a twice.
[228:21.98]And he stomps.
[228:22.90]Fuck!
[228:30.92]Two stomps.
[228:33.42]He's got such a difficult moveset to fucking telegraph.
[228:36.06]It really is ridiculous.
[228:37.88]Sometimes he stomps twice.
[228:40.03]Oyoyoy.
[228:40.43]I'll get it though.
[228:42.09]It'll take me a while.
[228:59.35]I didn't jump?
[229:00.29]I mean, I'm in the air.
[229:02.63]I was... You guys saw that.
[229:03.67]I'm in fucking goddamn air.
[229:23.52]Not good.
[229:34.83]Back up.
[229:35.91]Two stops.
[229:40.97]Fuck, I thought it was the balls.
[229:44.17]Oh, man!
[229:49.21]What?
[229:50.03]No!
[229:50.57]Come on!
[229:51.29]What?
[229:54.09]Do I have 500 ping?
[229:58.87]That's actually fucking infuriating.
[230:07.79]Ah, it's still him.
[230:17.58]The dream of maybe taking him down is still possible.
[230:35.12]Oh, fuck.
[230:35.64]Here it comes.
[230:36.02]I'm gonna throw it.
[230:36.52]No, it's not.
[230:48.98]Oh, we're so close to one.
[230:52.27]Firecrack is worthless here.
[230:53.81]What items could I possibly use right now to make this easier on me?
[230:57.67]Maybe... What about this?
[230:59.95]I'm curious.
[231:00.37]Let's just see something.
[231:05.90]Finger whistle?
[231:09.67]I'm just throwing darts here, hold on.
[231:21.63]Yes, I'll come over there!
[231:22.68]Hi!
[231:34.15]You wanted my attention?
[231:35.25]Well, I'm here.
[231:39.43]Can I poison him with this?
[231:47.26]No, I got the wrong thing equipped.
[231:48.80]Just kill me.
[231:49.16]Do it again.
[232:00.84]He's weak to the AK.
[232:05.86]I would, I would hope so.
[232:08.48]Defense sugar.
[232:09.80]Yeah, I could, I mean, here's the thing, though.
[232:11.28]I want to, if I use those now, I'll just waste them.
[232:15.60]You know, I want to get in a position where, a position where I'm confident in at least dodging or blocking or moving away from the majority of the moves.
[232:26.73]It's still right there.
[232:27.41]Like, oh, I didn't get the candy.
[232:28.69]It's gone.
[232:31.77]And this guy will use him all.
[232:33.29]He'll take every single thing from me.
[232:43.77]I guess some of the ones that are huge telegraphs, like this stomp.
[232:46.43]Maybe I'll try to deflect it.
[232:52.33]Let me see if it's possible.
[232:54.95]It's been getting good.
[232:56.71]Is it?
[233:08.34]There's so much time on when that move comes.
[233:14.86]You gotta time that move perfectly or you're gonna get hit by it every time.
[233:26.03]Stop.
[233:26.17]See if it's even possible, man.
[233:27.97]Come on.
[233:30.68]Well, he didn't get me.
[233:32.76]Somehow.
[233:39.64]What?
[233:40.02]No, like, really?
[233:41.40]Really?
[233:42.00]Realistically speaking, why did I not dodge that?
[233:45.37]I... Realistically speaking, let's be real about that.
[233:49.73]I can't jump that?
[233:51.73]Or am I just too close?
[233:55.89]I feel like it's half the time that move I can get away from.
[234:11.00]Yeah, so that's not like technically a sweep move.
[234:20.06]Okay.
[234:20.66]Alright, well, I did it.
[234:29.76]Fuck.
[234:37.91]I'm not even sure what I'm doing here.
[234:39.86]What?
[234:41.12]It looked like it was doing something.
[234:49.71]The fucking gigantic box!
[235:16.83]Fuck you!
[235:21.91]No, he's jumping!
[235:23.96]Oh!
[235:28.88]Phase one, done.
[235:36.61]Phase two, incoming.
[235:38.15]Attack!
[235:43.41]God, now what?
[235:44.65]Now what do we have to do?
[235:46.01]Same?
[235:47.13]More of the same?
[235:47.77]Looks like a little bit more of the same.
[235:58.99]I don't even know what the fuck happened there.
[236:14.31]You have to stay- you gotta just run the fuck away when he does that move.
[236:17.63]You just do.
[236:18.11]There's no way you can dodge those.
[236:21.49]Like right now, like I gotta get the fuck out of there.
[236:25.79]Hold on, itchy eye.
[236:26.61]Ugh.
[236:35.80]This is not- this is not- I- why would I even use that?
[236:46.04]No.
[236:47.32]Oh, sorry.
[236:50.30]Let's go.
[236:50.78]Let's try it again.
[237:10.62]My right eye is so irritated right now.
[237:14.08]Why?
[237:14.26]Do you have allergies or something?
[237:16.65]Hold on.
[237:17.03]Just kill me.
[237:17.41]I gotta start over.
[237:19.07]Ugh.
[237:27.88]I get this extreme eye-itchy irritation.
[237:32.08]Ugh.
[237:32.30]Ugh.
[237:40.07]What the fuck is happening right now?
[237:41.67]This is unbearable.
[237:44.34]My right eye is going crazy.
[237:49.10]This is a problem.
[237:53.82]Alright, let's go.
[238:07.86]Trying to deflect it.
[238:08.68]It's a mistake.
[238:09.94]Honest to God, I just didn't keep doing what I was doing.
[238:13.46]It's like, there's too much to have to remember at this point.
[238:16.30]I need to at least get to, like, the second or third phase.
[238:20.98]Maybe if you... I wonder if you deflect it if you, like, toss him backwards or something.
[238:29.32]Okay.
[238:37.09]Alright, I'm going up, but... Alright, it's fine.
[238:40.21]There he goes again.
[238:50.18]Back up.
[238:50.58]You get him to do that, you get a good bunch of hits on him.
[239:08.95]There he goes.
[239:09.39]He's going up.
[239:14.66]Get me away from the wall here, man.
[239:21.64]We gotta get away from the wall.
[239:23.98]Away from the wall.
[239:24.68]Away from it.
[239:25.08]Just come over here.
[239:26.98]But if you go too far away, he might throw that shit at you.
[239:29.32]You know what I'm saying?
[239:29.84]He might throw that shit at you.
[239:31.77]Oh.
[240:04.53]Throw, throw, throw, throw.
[240:05.73]I'm far away.
[240:11.01]Got it.
[240:11.97]Eight gourds.
[240:12.43]Let's go.
[240:12.83]He does that explosion.
[240:24.04]All right.
[240:24.70]Get it.
[240:32.10]Wait just a minute!
[240:33.16]Oh, he fucking did something different!
[241:00.44]Ohhhhh!
[241:01.82]That was a weird angle.
[241:13.24]Damn it.
[241:14.41]Oh god, I fucking hate that move.
[241:16.97]It's so hard to get around.
[241:20.27]Ugh, it really is.
[241:21.27]Just fucking takes up so much real estate and he's got more moves and shit now.
[241:25.15]This motherfucker is adding moves.
[241:37.29]I thought he was gonna do it.
[241:45.91]That's new.
[241:47.16]That's- oh my god, there's so many more things to learn.
[241:50.08]What the fuck is this?
[241:55.70]Jesus Christ, man.
[241:56.52]We got like- we got another- we got like a 25 minute boss fight if you do everything right.
[242:00.88]Oh my goodness.
[242:07.20]Is this Warcraft?
[242:08.06]Am I playing World of Warcraft?
[242:09.90]Or is this an action game?
[242:14.75]Yeah, we got him down to 5%.
[242:17.87]Yeah.
[242:18.13]2%.
[242:18.97]DPS hard.
[242:19.79]Okay, here comes phase 2.
[242:20.51]Alright, this is where the mages and the warlocks have to be over in the corner.
[242:25.66]Alright, go, go, go, go, go.
[242:26.44]Yeah, good, good, good.
[242:27.42]It's been 18 minutes.
[242:29.52]Yep.
[242:29.84]Okay, still fighting.
[242:30.48]1%.
[242:31.18]Come on, you can do it.
[242:58.63]There it is.
[243:00.69]There's the move.
[243:04.03]Oh my fucking god.
[243:06.16]I haven't seen him do that.
[243:26.35]Already not a great start, but I'll try it.
[243:31.04]Ah, what the fuck?
[243:44.19]You got too many, like, hairs!
[243:57.90]Oh, that was an instant kill.
[244:04.19]What in the name of fucking God, man.
[244:10.41]Instant kill.
[244:12.37]Okay.
[244:25.61]This is optional?
[244:26.43]Well, I've been here for long enough.
[244:27.49]I have to do it.
[244:28.77]I know this is probably the boss in this game.
[244:31.66]That they decided was going to be like this.
[244:34.58]And here it is.
[244:36.44]So, I'm going for it, man.
[244:38.74]I'm already here.
[244:39.36]I got him down to one bubble.
[244:41.08]I can't just leave.
[244:58.81]Again with this
[245:21.59]Oh, goddammit!
[245:22.77]Not again!
[245:23.51]Oh my god!
[245:24.79]It's the bane of my whole existence!
[245:27.43]It is guaranteed to die if it touches you!
[245:30.79]Oh!
[245:31.53]It's the worst!
[245:33.39]It's the worst!
[245:35.31]It's the worst.
[245:36.31]It's the worst, man!
[245:37.75]It's the worst!
[245:45.92]It's so hard to tell when he's gonna do it, too, because you gotta stay close.
[245:50.29]This motherfucker can just pull that like a dick.
[245:52.07]He can just throw it up there, whatever he wants.
[245:54.23]Let's go.
[246:18.77]Oh, I think he's doing something.
[246:20.27]Kind of in the wall, though.
[246:24.05]At least he hit me a couple times.
[246:36.04]Balls, right?
[246:36.96]Just, I'm getting the fuck out of here when he does this shit to me.
[246:47.72]I honestly cannot believe that the stomp hit me.
[246:51.74]This guy is an earth-sized hitbox.
[247:09.77]He stands there and he's got a hitbox the size of goddamn Jupiter around him.
[247:20.94]Holy shit.
[247:33.69]Well.
[247:35.15]Do I have anything I can do here?
[247:39.25]Is this guy dead?
[247:44.68]Wait.
[247:45.48]Why can I do this?
[247:48.36]I should know how to do this.
[247:53.99]I don't think I have anything, guys.
[248:00.99]Prevents damage from fire attacks, but man, I gotta go.
[248:03.85]I can't get that right now.
[248:07.24]I gotta go from all the way up here.
[248:12.60]To get this.
[248:27.47]Let's see what I can do for skills.
[248:32.57]That guy is fucking crazy.
[248:38.29]Well, there had to be one, right?
[248:39.59]Or two.
[248:43.37]Um, wait, no, no.
[248:44.21]Skills, skills, skills.
[248:48.61]I got six points.
[248:50.69]What do I need here?
[248:57.88]This is less sound.
[249:00.20]It's just more spirit emblems.
[249:16.07]Hmm.
[249:25.25]Fang and blade, mid-air prosthetic tool.
[249:40.79]I'm not sure what the hell I should buy.
[249:53.63]Well, I'm going to do this.
[250:02.61]Because that will... That seems good.
[250:06.86]Forward dash.
[250:08.84]After you use prosthetic, you can get close.
[250:13.62]Then these mid-air prosthetic.
[250:17.54]Tools while in mid-air.
[250:24.42]That sounds kind of good, actually.
[250:36.80]What was the other one?
[250:38.76]It was like another... It was deflection, right?
[250:40.66]Yeah, this one.
[250:47.07]You can deflect in the air.
[250:47.99]That's a huge deal.
[250:48.93]I don't know how the hell I didn't have this.
[250:55.57]And leads to combat arts while in the air.
[251:03.65]This is kind of good.
[251:09.30]I'm going to hold on to the points, though.
[251:11.36]Because I don't think there's anything else I really want here.
[251:23.56]Nightjar Slash.
[251:25.87]Living Force.
[251:27.95]Shadow Rush.
[251:30.91]Unleash a long-range powerful thrust and use the impaled opponent as a platform to vault into the sky.
[251:48.19]I don't know.
[251:48.72]I'm not sure.
[251:56.91]I mean, I have to spend them somewhere.
[252:07.75]Attack with the sword and tool simultaneously.
[252:09.51]That's pretty good.
[252:12.36]Mid-air tool.
[252:22.92]I like this.
[252:30.45]Let me take a look at it.
[252:33.27]Uh, special sword attacks can be performed immediately after using Prosthetic.
[252:36.24]Use Prosthetic and trigger it right afterward to a follow-up attack.
[252:39.18]Actually, I use the Firecracker so often.
[252:48.81]Alright, what do we got here?
[252:51.39]Floating Passage, I like it.
[252:54.39]I just took it off.
[253:02.87]Jermalight about Minecraft VR.
[253:04.07]Thanks for the five community subs.
[253:07.48]Thank you.
[253:08.98]Welcome back.
[253:09.36]All right, where's the uh, where the hell's the blacksmith?
[253:13.28]I don't have any money.
[253:18.46]I died like ten times.
[253:25.31]But thank you so much Jermalight about Minecraft VR.
[253:32.48]I'm gonna talk to Kuro again.
[253:36.93]Try to talk with the immortal training dude?
[253:38.29]He's dead.
[253:38.57]Secret passage.
[253:47.61]Yeah.
[253:47.71]Understood.
[254:03.56]Give gourd seed.
[254:04.50]Why would I... Oh.
[254:06.50]Flugboy!
[254:07.10]Five community subs from Flugboy.
[254:10.16]Thank you so much, Flugboy.
[254:18.81]Uh... Single-minded search for strength entered in taking the machine for his own.
[254:23.29]This is the result of combining techniques from the styles he encountered.
[254:27.72]Well, he's dead.
[254:28.72]I'll give him this book.
[254:30.52]Wait, so did I do... He died before we could fight.
[254:57.87]I still haven't beaten Lord Genichiro, I just want you to know there are bite marks in my controller, and I hope you're having a good night.
[255:03.95]This game's rough, man.
[255:07.69]It really is.
[255:09.65]It's a lot of fun, but it is fucking brutal.
[255:11.77]It is... super sharp.
[255:13.85]It's like... It's like eating the most delicious thing you've ever thought of.
[255:18.94]Think of like the most delicious hamburger you could ever eat.
[255:21.96]Oh my god, I would- I love it, it's a perfect flavor!
[255:24.92]But the burger's made out of glass.
[255:29.52]That's kind of how this is.
[255:30.40]Let me take a look at that.
[255:42.22]Oh, Jesus.
[255:45.47]Empowered mortal draw.
[255:46.93]How do I even get these?
[255:50.51]Not available.
[255:51.33]Five skill points.
[256:00.84]Ooh.
[256:01.72]Alright, well... I'm not sure.
[256:04.12]I'm not sure what to do.
[256:15.05]Should I keep smashing my head against the wall and try to beat this boss?
[256:20.24]Or should I continue to progress the story in the game?
[256:37.10]You know what?
[256:39.00]Here's what we're going to do.
[256:40.94]For the sake of... I went by a few different... There's at least two mini-bosses that I know that I can fight.
[256:54.83]There's at least a few.
[256:57.65]There's the drunk guy that was out... There's like two drunk guys.
[257:02.49]Go kill headless?
[257:03.67]No!
[257:05.01]No, no, I can't!
[257:07.11]I can't!
[257:12.68]I can't do it!
[257:13.52]I can't!
[257:14.98]I don't remember where it is, so I can't do it.
[257:21.90]It's like here, right?
[257:23.28]Oh, I can't do it.
[257:28.58]It's- was it Hidden Forest?
[257:31.68]All right, now this is gonna make me so mad.
[257:33.68]Did you see how many times I died at that boss?
[257:38.74]Those of you that were here last night, I died like three or four times to this guy and it drove me fucking mental.
[257:46.18]I was so angry.
[257:47.36]I just died like 10 to 15 times to that giant flaming monster and I'm like still fine learning.
[257:54.66]Oh, this is crazy.
[257:55.30]Wow, what a move.
[257:56.98]This is gonna ruin the stream.
[258:02.59]This is going to ruin the stream and I know it.
[258:04.43]Okay, I'm going to preemptively make sure that it doesn't ruin the stream.
[258:09.87]You hear me talking right now?
[258:11.34]I'm going to make sure that I'm preemptively making sure this is not going to ruin the stream.
[258:15.68]I'm going to be positive about this.
[258:19.34]I'm just going down and I'm going to fight him.
[258:21.36]Fuck items, we're just going to fight him.
[258:22.92]Alright, I'm ready.
[258:24.44]Here we go.
[258:26.02]I'm not going to get angry at this guy.
[258:53.67]Where is it?
[258:55.30]I have it.
[258:56.64]It's right here.
[258:57.06]I have five of these.
[258:57.64]No, I can't.
[258:57.96]I can't.
[258:58.20]I can't do this yet.
[258:58.72]No, no, no.
[258:58.90]I have to do this before I walk in the door.
[259:31.93]No!
[259:42.17]He's so awkward.
[259:53.37]I hate this fucking game.
[259:55.85]I hate this fucking series.
[259:57.37]I hate everything about this game.
[259:58.67]I'm giving it a 5 out of 10.
[260:00.67]No, no, just...
[260:03.37]Pull it back!
[260:09.75]Oh, he's so weird and slow.
[260:11.06]All right, I'm gonna get him this time.
[260:12.14]You ready?
[260:13.92]Okay, let's go.
[260:20.68]You won't like me when I'm angry.
[260:22.46]Get this off the bar.
[260:23.92]I'm going to do this right.
[260:25.42]Fuck this.
[260:26.68]I know this is going to be a repeat of yesterday.
[260:30.38]It's not that bad, but I'm going to eat all this candy before I go in there.
[260:33.50]You ready?
[260:39.04]What candy am I going to do?
[260:40.32]Attack candy.
[260:42.52]This motherfucker's dead.
[260:59.35]My god, no god damn it.
[261:02.03]Oh my god.
[261:03.51]Oh My god, he's fucking so oh my god, oh
[261:24.82]Dude, I fucking hate this enemy.
[261:28.87]He's so slow and so awkward and the terror buildup and the fact that you fight him in a kiddie pool and you can't dodge.
[261:37.54]Oh, I'm...
[261:55.01]Oh my fucking god, man.
[261:56.61]It's so stupid.
[261:58.45]I hate this enemy.
[262:16.54]I can't even see the game.
[262:29.00]Oh, man.
[262:31.94]Yeah, I don't care.
[262:32.80]Fuck him.
[262:37.26]I can't keep using this confetti, man, if I don't know, like, if I... The terror buildup.
[262:43.83]Everything about this.
[262:45.53]Makes me want to delete this game.
[262:47.31]Uninstall it, and then fucking shit on it.
[262:54.21]Like, okay, that move right there!
[262:56.07]Like, it's like, I can't even tell what he's gonna do!
[263:00.17]And now look at my Terror.
[263:02.78]It's already almost built up.
[263:12.24]The people aren't actually telling you to dodge.
[263:14.08]If you are, you're banned from the channel.
[263:38.22]Stop trying to parry, so if I swing at him, he's gonna hit me with the sword.
[263:46.78]I knew this was gonna happen.
[263:48.18]I don't even want to be here right now.
[263:51.02]Alright, let's be aggressive.
[264:00.79]Dead.
[264:04.99]I'm already dead from the passive.
[264:06.51]Terrible.
[264:33.67]I will die to this guy more than anyone else in the whole game.
[264:49.38]I hate this enemy so much.
[264:51.76]More than anything.
[264:53.02]More than any enemy in any of their games that they've ever made.
[264:56.01]Any of them.
[265:07.64]It's like... No!
[265:43.13]Oh no!
[266:08.06]This is the worst.
[266:09.54]This is worse.
[266:10.08]You know what?
[266:11.28]This is worse than the fucking flame dog that I was dying to.
[266:21.02]Okay.
[266:21.62]Somebody just said there's no point in attacking him.
[266:24.99]Somebody just told me, you're not being aggressive enough.
[266:27.31]Go in and be aggressive.
[266:28.33]Stop attacking.
[266:30.21]Do you understand?
[266:31.25]What are you talking about?
[266:59.78]Back up, back up!
[267:30.24]No way.
[267:30.88]No way that got me.
[267:31.98]No way I turned around and he still got me in the back.
[267:34.69]It's just Dark Souls 2 lag switching.
[267:37.49]I turned around and he still gets me in the back.
[267:39.47]Whoa.
[268:00.15]I only have three confetti.
[268:14.30]I have to make it count.
[268:16.18]I have to make it count.
[268:17.66]Let's go.
[268:32.56]No.
[268:40.22]Oh, come on!
[268:41.24]Okay, kill him.
[268:55.78]Kill him.
[268:57.44]Kill him.
[268:58.82]More?
[269:06.45]Oh my fucking stupid fucking thing!
[269:09.27]I'm almost dead with the terror!
[269:11.23]Do I have any more terror buildup shit?
[269:23.98]I don't.
[269:24.30]I don't have any more.
[269:31.76]What the hell?
[269:32.36]What the hell?
[269:32.86]What the hell?
[269:36.00]I didn't even have the confetti.
[269:37.78]Look at my terror, though.
[269:39.10]Why?
[269:39.90]What is this move he's doing?
[269:41.02]I don't care.
[269:45.70]I'll fucking go around in a goddamn circle.
[269:48.42]Oh, fuck.
[269:48.94]He still comes around here.
[269:55.86]Oh, fuck.
[270:03.60]Kill him.
[270:25.33]I killed him!
[270:27.25]I did it!
[270:27.77]Oh my god, my body!
[270:29.35]My body!
[270:29.89]I'll be right back.
[270:51.46]Okay, I just have to go like- I just have to like walk in a circle.
[270:55.38]I hate that.
[270:55.88]I hate this guy.
[270:56.98]I hate him.
[270:58.00]I hate this guy.
[270:58.82]I don't want to do that again.
[270:59.68]That's it?
[271:02.44]I don't get any prayer beads or anything?
[271:35.82]Killed the other two?
[271:36.52]No.
[271:37.88]You're going to have to go to another streamer for that one.
[271:43.49]You're going to have to go to another... You're going to have to click a different Sekiro streamer.
[271:47.99]If you stumbled on here and you're like, oh, let me watch this guy's Sekiro stream, you're going to have to go somewhere else.
[271:52.42]If you want to see somebody beat another guy.
[272:01.90]I hate it every second of that.
[272:03.70]I'm not even satisfied.
[272:04.74]You know when you kill a boss and you get sad?
[272:06.66]I'm not satisfied.
[272:08.28]I'm more angry.
[272:09.84]I'm more upset.
[272:18.32]Fuck that guy.
[272:19.40]I'm gonna just bone out of here.
[272:29.08]The other two are way easier.
[272:30.44]I don't believe you.
[272:31.34]You're gonna fight two at the same time?
[272:35.75]Oh, there's also like the wizards.
[272:37.77]The purple shooting wizards.
[272:40.31]Yeah, let me take a minute.
[272:42.81]Finish the demon.
[272:43.47]No, I can't.
[272:44.13]Not yet.
[272:44.49]I can't do it.
[272:50.30]The purple wizard guy.
[272:52.36]That's where we're going.
[272:57.88]The thing is, though, I... I used... I have one more confetti.
[273:05.49]Does this guy sell confetti?
[273:12.97]You do.
[273:14.17]300 bucks!
[273:17.31]That's a rip-off.
[273:23.44]That's three... What have I got?
[273:25.34]One dollar?
[273:28.57]I can get two of them here.
[273:38.85]Stupid enemies.
[273:39.77]I'm going to cry.
[273:41.55]It's going to make me cry.
[273:43.58]It's going to make me cry.
[273:45.90]All right.
[273:53.38]I'll take three.
[273:56.06]It's okay, German.
[273:56.84]Go ahead.
[274:04.00]All right, uh, I think... Where is it?
[274:07.94]It's like the bottomless hole, right?
[274:10.04]Let me just go see what this guy does.
[274:22.16]Did I go kill the ape with the mortal blade?
[274:23.60]Yes, I did.
[274:25.62]All right, let's go.
[274:26.82]Who cares if I die?
[274:28.10]We're going in.
[274:29.16]What's your move set?
[274:35.62]All terrible.
[274:41.20]Oh, that's awful.
[274:42.02]Oh, big terror meteor.
[274:44.14]Big terror meteor.
[275:09.81]Big one right?
[275:18.86]Watch out big one.
[275:39.12]Oh, there it's the end.
[275:40.20]That's the end.
[275:41.94]So you can't come in here unless you have terror.
[275:43.58]I need something to block the terror.
[275:46.58]Otherwise this is just a no-go.
[275:50.07]That's a cool move.
[276:12.46]I thought he swung again.
[276:20.36]As long as you keep moving, it's really not that big of a deal, but I could use some of those pacifying agents.
[276:26.08]Yeah, but that's not good.
[276:37.27]Another big one.
[276:37.75]Fuck.
[276:44.76]Keep making the big ones.
[276:49.86]That turned midway through hitting me.
[276:53.18]That ball curved in the air twice.
[276:58.02]I mean, fuck it, I can just sit here, can't I?
[277:07.75]This can take a while, but if anything helps, I stand still.
[277:15.55]Well, I know what he does.
[277:17.11]I was scared last time I was here, but if I come here prepared, yeah, I'll kill him pretty easily.
[277:37.32]Alright, watch out, watch out!
[277:39.44]Come on, let's go!
[277:48.00]I don't want to use a confetti.
[277:50.16]Not yet.
[277:50.50]I could just use it and get screwed.
[277:54.68]There we go.
[277:55.70]Let's go in now.
[277:58.71]No, not yet.
[278:01.31]Nice relaxing.
[278:02.17]Whoa!
[278:22.07]Another big one.
[278:22.59]I'm not supposed to get the items.
[278:26.23]That's a scrap metal.
[278:26.83]We'll take it.
[278:34.76]Maybe I will use a scrap metal.
[278:36.58]I mean a confetti.
[278:38.56]I'm feeling confident right now.
[278:42.00]Let's go.
[278:42.76]I got confidence right now.
[278:44.68]Bingo.
[278:45.06]Let's do it.
[278:53.32]There's one.
[278:57.92]Where'd he go?
[279:03.21]He's across the way, of course he is.
[279:16.59]I need a place to save myself here.
[279:18.53]Nope.
[279:23.23]I'm not good.
[279:24.15]Oh, this is bad.
[279:27.02]Really bad.
[279:29.98]What a waste of time.
[279:31.10]Fuck.
[279:31.46]That was a mistake.
[279:32.26]It was a huge mistake.
[279:34.56]I just came in here completely unprepared and thought I could kill him somehow.
[279:37.74]But he moved.
[279:38.60]For some reason, I didn't think he was going to move.
[279:40.42]And I had that little cheese strat.
[279:42.06]No.
[279:44.78]Alright, well, I'm not going to do that again until I have some pacifying things or something to stop that.
[279:58.64]Uh... The umbrella upgrade?
[279:59.84]I don't have... I don't think I have the umbrella upgrade.
[280:07.62]Confetti will kill him in like six hits.
[280:09.16]Yeah, but the problem is, is just if I get touched by anything, I just instantly die.
[280:13.08]That terror just... you're dead.
[280:14.92]I'd rather have at least the papers.
[280:20.68]There was a... Somebody sold one of those.
[280:28.17]Where is it?
[280:29.59]Wasn't there a guy... Mibu?
[280:32.75]Mibu Village?
[280:38.69]Mibu Manor.
[280:39.41]Mibu Village.
[280:41.95]There was a guy that sold a bunch of shit over here.
[280:51.92]Where is he?
[280:54.62]It's like a vendor right here, right?
[280:59.66]What do you got?
[281:00.72]Yeah, there it is.
[281:01.22]Modeled Purple Gourd.
[281:02.98]Reduces terror buildup and increases terror resistance.
[281:05.34]And he sells confetti.
[281:06.30]Okay.
[281:06.50]What do I got for money?
[281:14.33]How much was it?
[281:18.85]1800.
[281:19.45]Fuck, man.
[281:20.21]That's so much.
[281:24.07]Am I really going to spend every cent I own to get this?
[281:26.93]And then some?
[281:35.35]At least I'll own it.
[281:38.17]So, I need to sell some, like, ash or something, too.
[281:41.80]This is really good.
[281:47.58]Put me over there.
[281:48.30]I'm just gonna sell all my ash.
[281:50.28]I need... It's 300.
[281:58.80]Fuck it.
[281:59.12]I don't care.
[281:59.57]Okay.
[282:05.03]There it is.
[282:10.38]Sell some ashes.
[282:12.33]All right, let's try it again.
[282:32.40]Hopefully these gourds help later on down the road here in the game.
[282:39.61]Let's get it on here.
[282:43.45]Purple gourd.
[282:44.73]I got five, right?
[282:47.35]So how long do these last?
[282:48.47]I'm going to do a little bit... Just hold on.
[282:50.79]Let's see.
[282:52.21]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
[283:22.53]30.
[283:22.97]It's 30 seconds.
[283:23.89]That's a lot longer than I thought it was.
[283:32.26]Sure, let's go.
[283:34.28]Let me just see.
[283:36.44]How much does it reduce?
[283:40.55]It's pretty decent.
[283:43.85]It's pretty decent.
[283:49.12]Yeah, that's actually great.
[283:50.42]Alright, so now I'm just making sure I have confidence to use the confetti.
[283:53.64]Because really, I can just get in there and just beat the shit out of him right there.
[284:03.11]Yeah, like right there, like he'd be dead.
[284:09.97]Okay.
[284:12.02]Look at it, who cares?
[284:15.10]Maybe, well, let's, you know, do it.
[284:17.32]Let's go.
[284:19.18]See you later.
[284:19.60]Land!
[284:19.84]Oh.
[284:19.96]He didn't like that.
[284:22.84]Come here.
[284:30.90]Again!
[284:54.30]He's gonna do the blast again, isn't he?
[285:00.66]Alright, you're dead.
[285:04.18]Goodbye.
[285:15.98]Hey, look at that strategy.
[285:17.10]It works.
[285:17.56]There's another one of these guys, too.
[285:19.87]Ooh.
[285:21.78]Okay, so that's... That's the self-harm for pellets in Bloodborne.
[285:24.15]Okay.
[285:53.02]So the other one is down in... I really would rather have prayer beads, to be honest.
[286:01.39]Eh.
[286:04.17]Well, I got another confetti.
[286:06.29]And I have another... I have plenty of gourds, so... What does the other one draw?
[286:19.79]Let's go kill the other one.
[286:22.15]He's right here, right?
[286:25.31]What's a good place to go?
[286:26.25]Probably here.
[286:28.26]Because it's another one of these guys.
[286:44.04]Back this way.
[286:53.79]Yeah, he's under here.
[287:03.33]There he is.
[287:06.33]In the waterfall, right?
[287:08.00]He's, like, right here.
[287:08.52]Alright, let's make sure I don't get chased.
[287:15.64]He spawns, like, right in here.
[287:18.92]Is it right here?
[287:24.76]It is, right?
[287:27.92]I think.
[287:32.23]Maybe not this one, I think.
[287:38.69]Just get... Get off me.
[287:43.74]Why even have that?
[287:44.66]Why?
[287:45.18]Like, why?
[287:45.68]Just let me jump up it.
[287:49.62]Like, I have... I can't grab that shit?
[287:58.55]Okay, here we go.
[288:01.51]Can I land?
[288:02.29]I can probably take one of those.
[288:03.45]If there's another dog chasing me.
[288:07.03]No.
[288:07.61]Alright, so here we go.
[288:08.97]I should be able to get one orb taken away.
[288:17.03]Apparently not.
[288:18.81]Okay.
[288:28.68]Oh my god Easy now Watch that build up
[288:58.61]One.
[289:02.45]Where is he gonna be?
[289:03.47]At the end of the river?
[289:05.09]Back in the... I don't know.
[289:06.39]Where's he gonna be?
[289:11.65]Yup.
[289:12.19]Nice try.
[289:16.88]Out of confetti, guys.
[289:18.42]That's bad.
[289:22.02]What the f... Dude, you gonna do anything else?
[289:30.99]This sucks.
[289:31.57]This is actually terrible.
[289:42.01]Really?
[289:53.08]Why does that dog have to even be there?
[289:55.62]What's the point of that dog?
[289:58.57]It's just to be irritating.
[290:00.67]There's no other reason.
[290:01.85]It's just there to be annoying.
[290:15.86]Well, I kind of screwed myself there.
[290:17.26]I didn't have enough confetti.
[290:24.46]Well, what about some other bosses?
[290:27.01]Many bosses that I didn't kill?
[290:40.78]There was two drunk guys.
[290:50.19]Uh... Yeah, they were back here.
[290:57.95]Uh, where was that guy?
[291:02.11]I think down this way, right?
[291:09.06]Down here, if I remember?
[291:21.66]Because there was somebody... There was that... Like, he was purple.
[291:25.17]I remember.
[291:25.63]I don't even know if this is the right place.
[291:37.68]Maybe the other one was closer.
[291:38.66]No, I think this is... This is it, right?
[291:46.30]Okay.
[291:57.87]No.
[292:02.45]Because that's the water.
[292:05.67]Where the hell was that guy?
[292:08.57]These zones are so huge and expansive that it's really easy to forget where anything is.
[292:13.39]That's where the fish is.
[292:30.55]Wrong, nope.
[292:36.98]Where the fuck was this guy?
[292:39.96]A long time ago, I fought somebody and I said, nope, nope, not gonna happen.
[292:47.17]It was like the first two or three hours of the game.
[292:56.98]Where?
[292:57.84]He was in the castle, I think?
[293:16.32]Spear guy?
[293:16.70]No, I killed the spear guy.
[293:17.70]The spear guy died.
[293:21.86]It was the second drunk dude with the ghosts.
[293:26.05]Yeah.
[293:35.46]I feel like there's something down... no.
[293:36.96]No, that wa- oh, that- it was this way, but it was no- wait a minute, hold on.
[293:42.52]It was, uh... Too many places, too many things to remember.
[294:00.30]Here?
[294:13.49]Because then... This is down to the demon, but there was a guy... Yeah, down here.
[294:21.15]Alright, let's try this.
[294:27.70]Fire... Make a funny joke?
[294:35.22]What are you talking about?
[294:39.24]That's not how it works.
[294:44.67]What the fuck?
[294:45.43]Please save Ashina.
[294:47.23]Yeah, I remember this because there was a lot... I gotta clear this out.
[294:57.43]Try not to take that much damage.
[295:14.89]But is there a way for me to just shimmy across the bridge without being seen?
[295:18.80]There has to be.
[295:20.62]Don't tell me there's not.
[295:23.78]Right?
[295:24.26]Hang from ledge.
[295:29.26]Hang from ledge.
[295:30.69]Right here.
[295:31.87]No, I don't want to talk to you.
[295:34.11]Hang from ledge?
[295:35.79]Shit, no.
[295:37.27]There is no hang from ledge.
[295:43.48]I can do that.
[295:45.34]And then... No.
[295:46.25]They're looking at me.
[295:49.71]I wonder if it's possible.
[295:53.67]I don't know if it's possible.
[295:54.87]Come on.
[296:02.03]Dude.
[296:02.79]Oh no.
[296:03.33]I think you just gotta do it.
[296:05.03]You just have to do it.
[296:09.31]You gotta let him fight on the bridge and come in and just clean him up.
[296:20.30]I didn't do shit.
[296:21.40]One of the- Okay, that guy's bugged.
[296:23.16]That guy found a bug.
[296:24.56]I found a bug in the game.
[296:25.92]This guy, look at him.
[296:26.54]Ready?
[296:26.76]Ready?
[296:26.94]Watch this.
[296:27.24]Watch this guy's posture.
[296:39.33]Okay, now watch the guy right here.
[296:40.73]This guy's posture.
[296:41.51]Look at that.
[296:42.49]I found a bug.
[296:43.49]Stop.
[296:43.85]Just fucking play.
[296:45.63]Ugh.
[296:48.63]This is so difficult, like I can't like be making stupid jokes here.
[296:52.17]Oh my god.
[296:53.07]This portion right here where you have to deal with like four or five people at the same time is very difficult.
[297:01.80]I can't be like, No, just do it.
[297:07.52]Kill them.
[297:07.96]Go.
[297:10.88]That person asking for jokes.
[297:12.80]You understand how much focus it takes to play this?
[297:16.52]I can't be like fucking dancing around.
[297:27.74]Let's go, fighting together.
[297:39.12]Who are you locking onto?
[297:57.66]He's still on the demon?
[297:58.56]No, I left the demon.
[298:00.60]I'm trying just to progress in other ways.
[298:02.72]Of course, this motherfucker over here with the gun.
[298:10.21]Let's wrap back around.
[298:47.53]Nice shot!
[298:48.37]See how it feels?
[298:49.71]You see how that feels to have that happen to you?
[298:52.27]It sucks, because you and I were in a one-on-one fight, and then you were... I didn't even see your friend.
[299:04.71]I thought it was a sweep.
[299:05.74]And that guy, good.
[299:08.32]Yeah, bring it on.
[299:17.70]He's monologuing.
[299:19.76]Oh, Jinder's ready!
[299:20.67]Hello, Jinder's ready!
[299:32.31]Oh, no!
[299:36.66]Where even is the dinner?
[299:38.32]Where's the dinner guy?
[299:41.70]This is not even the dinner guy!
[299:43.14]What the fuck?
[299:44.06]Who is this?
[299:46.58]Stop it, I'm gonna hear this in my sleep!
[300:04.98]Does anybody know where this guy is?
[300:06.76]I just hear him.
[300:10.10]Where is he?
[300:12.22]It's getting louder.
[300:13.12]Is he on the roof?
[300:19.61]You motherfucker.
[300:37.24]There he is.
[300:37.77]There's that little shit.
[300:50.80]So then after all this... Then I gotta fight a boss.
[300:54.20]I'm gonna try to reset him.
[300:55.94]And get the... Oh, come on, man.
[301:00.37]I gotta take him out.
[301:01.97]Where is... I need one of these guys.
[301:06.93]There's... Two samurai left.
[301:11.21]There's one.
[301:22.88]I don't know.
[301:23.18]Is he here?
[301:23.58]I can hear something.
[301:25.32]Yeah, of course he is.
[301:34.23]Oh.
[301:36.85]God.
[301:37.83]You suck.
[301:46.19]You suck.
[301:48.49]There's the guy with the rifle.
[301:49.61]Come on.
[301:50.10]He should be able to burn his friend.
[301:52.81]No, that's unrealistic.
[301:53.89]This takes place in realistic Japan.
[301:56.99]Alright.
[302:11.50]Climb the fucking ledge!
[302:19.96]Dude, there's so much to have to pay attention to!
[302:22.68]This is like scratching your stomach, scratching your ass, reading a book, driving a car, eating a taco, and giving a speech at the same time.
[302:35.53]Ugh!
[302:54.56]You forget about me?
[302:55.52]I'm one of the 30 people here.
[302:58.28]Forget about the big drunk guy running around.
[303:00.00]Yeah, watch out for him.
[303:00.86]He'll kill you in one hit.
[303:03.40]Did you meet the pan guy yet?
[303:04.98]Why didn't you stealth through here?
[303:14.68]I mean, if you had stealth through here, somebody would have seen you and then the whole camp would have attacked you.
[303:20.67]What were you doing?
[303:21.65]What were you thinking?
[303:22.70]Oh my fucking God.
[303:24.78]Fuck this place.
[303:25.52]Oh my God.
[303:37.00]Oh my God.
[303:38.44]I can't hurt anybody.
[303:44.50]What are you thinking?
[303:46.48]What are you thinking?
[304:04.38]Just go fight the demon, you were having more fun.
[304:06.52]I was, you're right!
[304:10.72]Fuck this Warzone!
[304:15.83]With the guys that sometimes take 30 hits and sometimes you kill in fucking four swings.
[304:23.47]It's not, it's a stab.
[304:36.65]I hate this place.
[304:39.45]This is the optional area where, hey, do you hate yourself and hate video games?
[304:43.83]Come here and have a fucking blast.
[305:00.10]You ever shove a wrench up your ass?
[305:02.46]This is what it feels like.
[305:07.25]You don't even have to do it now!
[305:08.47]Trying to lock on didn't want to work.
[305:38.89]This dude swings every second.
[305:41.63]Every second.
[305:42.79]He just doesn't stop.
[305:43.95]Every second.
[305:45.23]Every second.
[305:46.55]Every second.
[305:47.89]He just doesn't stop swinging.
[306:09.57]My god, I just wanted to come over here.
[306:15.05]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[306:23.77]Let's go get him.
[306:25.94]He's up there.
[306:27.48]Everybody hurry the fuck up and get up there.
[306:29.00]This is the fastest I've moved in two months.
[306:36.57]Oh, I'm just fucking tilted.
[306:49.26]This is- I hate this shit.
[306:54.62]That's a fu-
[307:00.47]He's just having fun.
[307:01.71]He's having fun just blasting shit.
[307:03.76]Look at this move.
[307:04.86]Yeah, I pretended to swing at you.
[307:06.18]Wouldn't that be cool?
[307:10.20]I'm really doing the Joker laugh right now.
[307:12.46]This level is hell.
[307:13.51]This is relentless fucking enemies.
[307:17.67]And then the fat guy.
[307:18.65]And if you don't kill the pain guy, everybody aggro's.
[307:20.63]And there's like fucking snake grass over there.
[307:22.69]It's supposed to help.
[307:24.26]It don't.
[307:33.09]Finally, you and I can fight.
[307:37.51]One on one though, just you and me.
[308:02.39]I have no health.
[308:05.99]What?
[308:09.20]We've lost him.
[308:10.04]Yeah, man, like, this sucks.
[308:12.62]It really does.
[308:14.38]Like, fuck me.
[308:18.68]Oh, now he's on fire.
[308:20.64]You gotta go through all that bullshit to fight this guy.
[308:27.17]But it's optional, though, Jeremy.
[308:29.41]Hey!
[308:32.97]I'm not gonna be able to do this
[309:09.44]Wow I just dropped
[309:27.80]No, a streamer pukes playing security.
[309:35.20]Something about this is so funny.
[309:36.74]Dude, were you there when he fucking puked?
[309:45.46]No, fuck.
[309:52.43]I wanted to just get away from the wall there.
[310:38.25]Goddammit, it wasn't over!
[310:40.49]I thought it was three!
[310:43.23]This game's gonna make me fucking lose my mind.
[310:46.14]I thought it was three swings.
[310:48.56]This game's gonna fuck me up.
[310:50.06]This game's gonna fuck me up.
[311:02.43]What the fuck?
[311:14.72]Fucking optional area.
[311:19.50]Optional.
[311:29.04]Where's that?
[311:29.48]I know I have another one.
[311:31.54]Oh, I'm so fucked up right now.
[311:33.16]This is fucking killing me.
[311:43.17]Oh.
[311:45.79]Where is it?
[311:46.49]I don't even know where it is.
[311:50.19]Which is it?
[311:50.61]This one?
[311:51.07]No, that's the demon.
[311:55.72]Stairway?
[311:56.28]I think it's stairway.
[312:05.74]I beat this guy in one swing.
[312:09.94]I'm fucking happy you did.
[312:12.75]I really hope that's true, because yeah, that's good.
[312:15.82]I hope you did, for real.
[312:23.04]Okay, so if I go from here... ...to... ...backwards from there... I think there's too many.
[312:40.09]I wonder.
[312:40.55]Can I get over here without having a problem?
[312:47.55]Right here, but... No way everyone's going to get pulled here.
[312:51.30]Unless I can... Maybe if I kill those guys first.
[312:58.86]I don't know.
[312:59.44]That's tricky.
[313:01.58]Okay.
[313:02.71]Across the game.
[313:06.37]I mean, it's possible maybe to pull just him.
[313:10.29]If I clear these guys first.
[313:11.67]Which, I mean, it's like four people.
[313:12.87]That's not different.
[313:20.22]This actually may be... These guys have cannons and shit too.
[313:29.57]Let me resurrect here.
[313:49.68]Because this two patrol... Where... The guy... Where's the... Okay, he's up here.
[313:56.15]You have to die.
[313:57.67]Right?
[313:57.91]He's gonna shoot arrows.
[314:07.01]And that leaves... Okay, flame barrel memo.
[314:12.68]When we broke into Hirata Estate, we found a barrel that spewed flame.
[314:18.00]Must have been a shinobi's tool.
[314:22.10]The boys lit a roaring bonfire that made merry with the drink.
[314:24.86]Must have been a tool.
[314:28.70]Don't I already have this tool that he's speaking of?
[314:31.04]Okay, where... This building's on fucking fire.
[314:38.55]I didn't even get any of these.
[314:39.45]Let me get these.
[314:40.03]It's just ashes.
[314:42.15]I'm gonna have to come down here for an ash and a pellet.
[314:51.57]Alright, so... There should be another two people.
[315:04.36]This actually is probably easier.
[315:05.88]Because there's really just a couple guys here.
[315:08.70]I don't think there's anybody behind me still.
[315:11.26]God, I can't...
[315:21.41]Did you just shoot that in the air?
[315:22.65]No.
[315:23.49]I mean, that's a nice firework, but... When is it gonna stop?
[315:31.25]You can stop now.
[315:32.55]You can stop now!
[315:34.61]You can stop now!
[315:41.81]Alright.
[315:43.75]I'm ready.
[315:45.09]Let's go.
[315:45.49]What do I want here?
[315:51.60]Maybe sparking, um... I don't even know if this does.
[316:00.60]Alright, bring him out here.
[316:11.72]Wait, wait a second.
[316:12.60]Wait a minute.
[316:13.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[316:15.10]Yes!
[316:31.60]Oh, I thought that was gonna be a dive.
[316:32.72]That's new.
[316:44.59]I'm fucked.
[316:45.38]Ah, the slow movements, man.
[316:46.92]It kills me.
[316:49.54]You guys know it.
[316:50.10]I'm gonna fight a guy that's so fast, the slower you are, the harder it is for me to fucking beat you.
[316:54.44]It just is the case.
[317:03.73]Fuck you.
[317:10.10]Help me, the fire's fucking me up.
[317:13.16]So erratic.
[317:26.43]Oh my god.
[317:27.55]You spend so much time just getting used to fucking me.
[317:35.20]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[317:52.55]Instant kill moves are never fun.
[317:54.44]They just aren't.
[317:55.30]They never are!
[318:22.18]Oh, my fucking lord, there's a full team.
[318:30.84]Where did these guys come from?
[318:32.31]I don't know where these guys came from.
[318:47.06]Uh, I can't really go... You should be burning right now.
[318:52.48]If it hurts me, it should hurt you.
[318:54.19]The laws of physics.
[318:55.07]Oh my god, I can't even see him!
[319:04.17]He's like, camouflaged!
[319:05.73]Oh, fuck off!
[319:30.52]You need to tone it down.
[319:31.34]You're at an 8.
[319:32.04]Do you see why?
[319:32.88]I'm surprised I'm not fucking at an 11.
[319:39.14]I can't go on that.
[319:49.25]All this to fight this fat drunk asshole.
[320:30.08]I gotta dodge the crown when he does that.
[320:48.02]Well, never mind.
[320:48.98]He's gonna 180 degree turn into me.
[320:51.51]Forgot.
[321:01.35]Two.
[321:03.93]Dude, I thought I could parry all of them, but you still got more shit for me to do?
[321:14.86]Look at my posture!
[321:24.23]I'm stuck in a wall.
[321:24.89]I don't even know what I'm stuck in.
[321:31.66]Oh, good thing I just used it.
[321:50.24]Come on.
[321:53.36]Sorry, I got the immunity.
[321:54.82]Doesn't really matter though.
[322:00.91]What the fuck was that?
[322:04.19]Doing a headbutt?
[322:20.85]Nope.
[322:51.24]God damn it, man.
[323:07.13]Get out of my life!
[323:09.39]God, fucking save me.
[323:15.35]That guy fucking sucked.
[323:40.20]Okay, I need one more prayer bead and I got better... I'll just keep going over here.
[323:44.12]Alright.
[324:01.87]I'm outta here.
[324:02.95]Wait, I didn't clear this before.
[324:04.27]I might as well take a look and see if there's anything else here.
[324:16.86]Oh, the amount of energy that I just, like, expelled from my body over the course of the last hour or two.
[324:42.64]Where's the other- where- there's an ogre.
[324:47.25]There's an ogre.
[324:49.93]I remember.
[324:51.25]And there's another bead there, and then I'm gonna attempt the demon guy.
[324:55.91]I can't guarantee that's gonna happen tonight.
[324:57.51]I can't.
[324:58.05]Alright, there's a guy there.
[325:07.62]We'll have to come back and do it tomorrow.
[325:11.92]Alright, forgot these guys.
[325:13.24]Wait for them to jump up.
[325:15.74]Somebody two?
[325:16.80]One?
[325:18.19]Is it just one guy trying to fight me?
[325:30.53]Is it just this one guy that's attacking me?
[325:32.36]I think so.
[325:32.78]No, no, no.
[325:39.62]I'm with Axe.
[325:48.90]That didn't break his head?
[326:08.35]Secura, but every time you die you have to solve a Picross puzzle!
[326:18.36]Picross was amazing.
[326:19.28]Yeah, imagine, like, think of how different those games are.
[326:26.25]Ooh, easy, easy now.
[326:37.69]Indeed.
[326:40.72]A lot of healing.
[326:44.98]It'll force you to stay calm.
[326:48.48]It's so easy to still go absolutely fucking mental playing this game.
[326:53.81]It just is.
[326:54.43]It's just the way it is.
[326:56.31]You have to accept it.
[327:08.21]What is that?
[327:09.43]Is this...
[327:17.86]I thought I could reach it.
[327:23.86]It looks like I can reach.
[327:32.61]Where am I going?
[327:39.99]Where the fuck am I going?
[327:45.14]Uh...
[328:03.56]This is just taking me back to... I don't think I can reach it from here.
[328:14.55]What the hell?
[328:33.22]That's just the fire.
[328:46.00]Two thousand dollars?
[328:47.68]Where did I get two grand from?
[328:50.70]What?
[328:51.77]What?
[329:01.27]What am I supposed to do with this?
[329:02.22]I gotta spend this money somewhere.
[329:03.48]I don't think I can buy any more.
[329:21.91]No.
[329:23.17]I'm gonna have to go to the other guy that sells this shit, right?
[329:26.09]What about upgrades?
[329:35.89]Alright.
[329:37.87]I need one more of those salt things and I can get the purple fume spark.
[329:43.77]It's the thing I want.
[329:53.24]Shit.
[330:04.93]Ugh.
[330:08.03]I'm gonna have to go buy sacks.
[330:19.38]Where is that guy at the... This guy has sacks, right?
[330:34.39]You got sacks?
[330:38.79]Oh, you're the exact person I'm glad to talk to.
[330:41.91]What am I going to do with this $300?
[330:59.54]Confetti?
[331:00.00]Confetti?
[331:06.88]Just to have it so I can not lose the money.
[331:17.72]Alright.
[331:22.58]What's next?
[331:24.64]Oh, the ogre.
[331:25.84]Right.
[331:33.79]What's the quickest way to get to the ogre?
[331:39.29]Probably just go back around.
[331:51.38]See, like, I could go all the way around this way and skip this whole thing.
[332:11.10]No, no, no, no!
[332:25.89]Go back, go, go to the snake.
[332:27.29]But I can't, the snake just blew me off the mountain last time.
[332:46.43]Fuck, I need a second wind.
[332:48.03]How do I get a second wind?
[332:49.91]I need a second wind right now.
[332:51.25]I need a second wind.
[332:59.18]My sails.
[332:59.90]I need to put my sails back up.
[333:02.28]How does one do that?
[333:04.66]Smoke crack.
[333:06.00]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[333:07.46]Eat an entire can of spinach.
[333:15.16]One pick Ross puzzle.
[333:16.28]No, I can't.
[333:17.48]I don't think my brain will work.
[333:21.00]Okay, where's the snake?
[333:24.54]Can I make that job?
[333:27.52]Yeah, I did it already.
[333:30.52]Into the snake cave.
[333:38.62]Is it this way?
[333:39.34]I don't know where the fuck I'm going, guys.
[333:47.97]Now, the snake cave is like its own thing, isn't it?
[333:57.48]Isn't the snake cave, like, down here?
[333:59.52]It's like one of these, right?
[334:03.74]Sunken Valley or Gunfort?
[334:08.00]It's one of these.
[334:13.54]I think it's Gunfort.
[334:25.51]It's the Ecto Cooler level.
[334:32.10]Because then from here... Go backwards?
[334:37.40]No, there is like a little cave.
[334:44.70]Sunken Valley Passage, and then... In... I don't know, in there?
[334:51.45]No...
[335:00.95]What the fuck are you doing here?
[335:02.05]Ah, fruits of the serpent, yes?
[335:06.24]There are two kinds.
[335:08.58]One is fresh.
[335:10.52]The other is dried.
[335:12.98]Over there.
[335:14.58]The dried fruit is over there.
[335:17.40]Past the poison swamp.
[335:20.34]Down the nest.
[335:21.94]That's where you'll... What are you talking about?
[335:25.71]Something troubling you?
[335:27.86]Rice for me.
[335:29.04]That's the way.
[335:30.30]Rice, I say.
[335:31.54]I got rice.
[335:32.16]If something's not right, bless me with rice.
[335:38.40]I got rice.
[335:39.22]Um, should I give her rice?
[335:41.32]I have this.
[335:42.08]I've been holding on for a long time.
[335:48.44]Here's some rice.
[335:50.81]Oh, there's no doubt.
[335:52.63]This is the divine child's rice.
[335:56.73]Oh, thank heavens.
[335:59.25]Thank heavens.
[336:00.94]Tell me what you see.
[336:08.88]If it's dried fruit you're after, become a trainer of monkeys.
[336:17.37]Make the monkey dance.
[336:22.85]The monkey?
[336:23.87]The monkey that was down... Oh, the monkey that was dancing around.
[336:31.18]The monkey that's scared.
[336:32.12]Alright.
[336:32.48]So how do I do that?
[336:34.54]Make the monkey dance.
[336:53.26]I think I have an idea.
[336:57.68]Oh, the game's like a 6 out of 10, because of the Poison's Wild, remember that?
[337:10.86]Poison's... Just fuck this guy.
[337:14.38]Here we go.
[337:21.56]so make the monk wait there's a guy here too buy from you oh what do you got I thought I was under the impression guys that I was in a pause menu no I can't believe it
[337:48.93]Fucking monkey.
[337:50.57]Just make the monkey dance.
[338:06.88]Alright.
[338:14.66]Anyways.
[338:15.10]It was nice talking to you.
[338:18.63]Do you have anything?
[338:19.35]You got... Okay, I'm gonna cure the dragon rot.
[338:23.79]You have coin purses here.
[338:25.15]Alright, make the monkey dance.
[338:30.20]So, if I go into here, Puppetry.
[338:38.02]I'm going to assume that it'll just move around.
[338:41.60]And then I get a free snake.
[338:53.41]I forgot that you guys existed.
[338:56.91]Ugh.
[339:06.86]Make the monkey dance.
[339:09.40]I remember this being- this was terrifying when I first saw it.
[339:11.86]Go through.
[339:23.20]That's the side.
[339:26.52]And then there's a platform down here.
[339:29.73]Where is that platform?
[339:31.77]Where's the platform?
[339:33.23]Where's the platform?
[339:34.83]Where's the platform?
[339:36.57]Where's the platform?
[339:37.49]It's up above me.
[339:43.64]Okay.
[339:45.06]And then down here.
[339:52.74]Here we go.
[339:53.42]Big snake.
[339:55.76]Monkey.
[339:56.28]I can go this way, right?
[339:59.48]Can I make this jump?
[340:01.31]I forgot if I could.
[340:05.05]Right.
[340:05.47]Okay.
[340:06.09]I did the same thing.
[340:07.69]Here we go.
[340:08.99]Alright.
[340:09.45]Make the monkey dance.
[340:14.67]Make the monkey dance.
[340:17.59]And... Is that a dance?
[340:27.41]It actually is a dance.
[340:36.68]I did it.
[340:37.06]I made it.
[340:37.38]I made it.
[340:37.70]Now what do I do?
[340:39.48]Oh, fuck.
[340:40.22]I've never been here before.
[340:41.60]I've never been in here before.
[340:54.15]Can I kill it like this?
[341:01.75]Pickup item.
[341:03.13]Dried Serpent Viscera.
[341:05.76]A dried, permission-like heart of the Great Serpent.
[341:08.78]The Great Serpent is a god of the land, and the heart is believed to be where one's spirit resides.
[341:12.94]While it looks much like a persimmon, in fact, this is the red viscera of a god.
[341:18.55]Apparently, denizens of Sunken Valley worship the organs, believing they represent the deity itself.
[341:28.91]Who cares?
[341:29.97]How do I get out of here?
[341:37.46]I got like a shriveled up avocado from my trouble.
[341:59.85]I guess I just have to bone out of here?
[342:28.11]I'm sure you're in the exact spot.
[342:35.79]Confetti.
[342:36.35]Nice.
[342:38.67]And this leads... back here.
[342:42.21]What's this?
[342:44.63]Same shit?
[342:48.50]Just down where I was.
[342:49.80]Some dumb shit.
[342:50.94]It's fine.
[342:59.64]Dumb shit.
[343:02.26]This is how you get the item that's over here, right?
[343:04.98]Remember I was talking about how I couldn't get up there?
[343:07.93]No, that's not even true.
[343:09.89]That's unfortunate.
[343:12.01]Okay, so I have this heart.
[343:20.56]Yeah, I thought that was gonna put me over here for some reason.
[343:26.86]All right, well, I really don't know what to do with this.
[343:38.25]There's no way for me to get up there.
[343:40.30]There has to be something I can do.
[344:08.63]Let me see.
[344:09.21]Hold on.
[344:09.69]There's nothing to go this way.
[344:15.89]Let me see.
[344:18.71]I'm not coming back to this area ever again.
[344:20.34]I might as well take a look.
[344:24.28]Right.
[344:26.88]Am I crazy or did I just see a thing to grab?
[344:55.44]Maybe from this tree?
[344:56.32]Can I jump from the tree and then up?
[345:04.15]No.
[345:05.71]Fuck.
[345:11.29]I wish I... I need... I'm gonna take the binoculars out for the first time.
[345:32.49]What did you not swing for?
[345:34.49]Why did I not swing?
[345:36.21]I just stood there like a fucking idiot.
[345:43.92]Give me the binoculars.
[345:54.86]Are you going to shoot at me from here?
[345:57.24]Are you?
[345:58.10]Yeah, of course you are.
[346:01.80]pinpoint fucking accuracy too.
[346:09.04]All right, let me just... I want to take a look.
[346:25.11]Give me the stupid thing.
[346:30.11]First time ever using it.
[346:37.16]It looks like a cave back there.
[346:39.76]I think it's a cave.
[346:45.40]Okay.
[346:57.63]Oh, get up there.
[347:12.70]I'm here.
[347:14.44]Poison pool.
[347:16.96]Ape.
[347:17.94]The sculptor's idol is unavailable until it's communed with again.
[347:20.72]Why?
[347:29.33]Backwards from poison pool?
[347:39.47]Wait a minute.
[348:06.18]No.
[348:07.69]No, that's not normal.
[348:09.57]If you dip... Oh, God.
[348:15.05]Okay.
[348:16.59]Well, why are you in here?
[348:18.64]It's just another one of these guys.
[348:19.66]How much confetti do I have?
[348:23.24]I'm not sure I have enough.
[348:26.68]Oh, I got plenty.
[348:30.69]Well, I'm gonna try... Let's kill him.
[348:36.64]I kind of want full health, though.
[348:38.96]That'd be a plus.
[348:43.36]It was a large ape.
[348:47.07]You're a liar.
[348:48.79]I know.
[348:50.21]But I only have one string of dialogue.
[348:56.61]I can't help it.
[348:59.53]I wish I could say sorcerer.
[349:26.84]Wait, is there?
[349:32.58]Is this closer?
[349:33.64]Not like it matters.
[349:49.75]Confetti.
[349:50.33]What do you got?
[349:53.65]This looks good.
[350:01.86]Bingo.
[350:04.64]Let's go fight this guy.
[350:06.74]Sure.
[350:06.96]Why not?
[350:16.68]Jerm is only good at the game because he smokes a crack.
[350:20.84]Okay.
[350:31.36]I was going to say, they weren't going to make it back, were they?
[350:41.66]That is a lot more buildup.
[350:46.44]Well, I didn't mean to dash through it.
[350:51.00]I don't know why.
[350:53.01]Arena roll?
[350:54.39]Really?
[350:57.44]Not even... Wow.
[350:59.53]That was fucking bullshit RNG right there.
[351:01.69]Again.
[351:04.83]Again, again, again, again, again.
[351:11.89]Confetti.
[351:35.17]What?
[351:36.02]Oh, fuck you.
[351:36.84]Disappeared again.
[351:54.17]Fuck.
[351:58.45]I gotta kill him now.
[351:59.45]He's gonna die now.
[352:01.94]Oh, fuck you and that hitbox.
[352:03.54]Eat my fucking balls.
[352:12.91]It's alright, I win.
[352:14.17]I win, I win, I win.
[352:15.13]He's dead, he's dead.
[352:17.07]Can I get an execution?!
[352:31.92]An old ring well-suited for slender fingers, Kingfisher is engraved on the underside.
[352:36.69]It can be used to upgrade the Finger Whistle prosthetic.
[352:39.19]I don't need any of this.
[352:43.79]Wearing this ring as you blow the finger whistle will create a somber tune.
[352:46.45]The weeping voice is full of solitude and beauty.
[352:50.19]Quell a voice of rage.
[352:54.17]I don't use the finger whistle, though.
[353:02.94]Rage, though.
[353:03.72]Wait.
[353:06.72]Sorry, that probably was very loud.
[353:13.93]Oh, yeah.
[353:15.75]Quells of rage, huh?
[353:20.53]Hmm.
[353:22.35]I made a World of Warcraft reference three hours ago.
[353:25.19]And I'm going to make it again.
[353:27.43]It is a World of Warcraft boss.
[353:28.93]You all laughed and said, oh, wow reference.
[353:32.02]I have to trankshot this boss.
[353:41.88]That's the way to beat it.
[353:47.57]I'm going to do this too.
[353:56.97]God, I can't handle these rage streamers.
[353:59.38]I'm going to leave.
[354:00.04]When did I rage?
[354:02.34]When did I rage today?
[354:04.56]I didn't do that.
[354:07.04]When?
[354:09.26]A lot?
[354:09.60]No, I didn't.
[354:13.85]Where's the guy that wants the flower?
[354:23.13]I did not rage at all.
[354:24.43]I got slightly... slightly irritated.
[354:28.01]Let me link the clip.
[354:32.20]Let's see.
[354:36.10]He's so awkward.
[354:48.50]I hate this fucking game.
[354:49.76]I hate this fucking series.
[354:51.30]I hate everything about this game.
[354:52.60]I'm giving it a 5 out of 10.
[354:54.64]No, no, just... Pull it back.
[354:59.97]See, I pulled it back.
[355:01.11]That doesn't count.
[355:04.11]I pulled it back.
[355:04.95]I immediately pulled it back.
[355:06.23]I immediately...
[355:17.88]What's this one?
[355:21.61]Disappeared again.
[355:23.33]Fuck.
[355:26.21]I just did this.
[355:27.59]I gotta kill him now.
[355:28.35]He's gonna die now.
[355:29.37]Oh, fuck you and that hitbox.
[355:32.69]Eat my fucking balls.
[355:34.01]These are fucked.
[355:46.40]Hold on, what's this?
[355:50.32]WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL
[356:22.41]I killed him!
[356:28.25]Did I beat him here?
[356:44.54]I killed him!
[356:46.16]I did it!
[356:46.60]Oh my god, my body!
[356:48.08]My body!
[356:50.53]What the hell?
[356:51.13]What the hell?
[356:51.61]What the hell?
[356:52.36]Why the... Oh, I accidentally clicked... I clicked it twice.
[356:55.80]Very fast.
[356:56.32]I clicked like... That's why.
[357:11.35]This game is fucked.
[357:13.55]This game is fucked.
[357:15.31]I'm telling you.
[357:21.65]Is this the right way?
[357:26.38]He was like up the mountain, right?
[357:34.94]Oops.
[357:40.63]Oh, fuck.
[357:41.05]Man, wait.
[357:41.49]Listen, look.
[357:41.99]What?
[357:42.37]I didn't even mean to do that and it's gonna get me a... No, it's not.
[357:45.75]No, I had it.
[357:46.87]There was a secret item over there and I just accidentally fucked it up.
[357:51.45]Hold on a second here.
[357:56.15]Where was that?
[357:56.73]Oh, wait!
[358:02.43]Fuck.
[358:06.09]I can make this, I think.
[358:19.54]How am I supposed- How do I do that?
[358:22.23]I'm doing something slightly wrong.
[358:35.30]Maybe the angle?
[358:38.54]Oh, I just, it just popped up.
[358:40.86]I just had the pop-up.
[358:43.90]I got the indicator, did you see that?
[358:51.65]What?
[358:51.89]Why was it that it had a no smoking sign on it?
[358:54.67]Why?
[358:55.00]Fuck, the indicator was there.
[359:10.52]You saw it, right?
[359:11.44]I'm not crazy.
[359:32.16]Got it!
[359:33.82]Okay, wait.
[359:35.08]What is this?
[359:35.48]Come on, have it be something cool.
[359:45.70]Prayer beads!
[359:46.42]Prayer beads!
[359:47.18]I know it!
[359:47.62]Come on!
[359:48.76]No, it's alright.
[359:49.66]That's still cool.
[359:55.53]That's still cool.
[359:56.19]I can keep going that way too.
[360:01.05]Hey, 500 bucks is 500 bucks.
[360:11.66]Still going.
[360:14.58]Ooh, a little cave.
[360:15.52]Nope.
[360:15.98]I'm losing my fucking mind.
[360:31.68]What?
[360:34.56]That was the biggest mistake you've ever made.
[360:38.40]Okay, I can Mario Jump up here.
[360:45.18]Cool, alright.
[360:51.60]Oh, fuck.
[360:53.10]Ooh, I got it!
[360:56.67]A small pinwheel made of white paper found below a cliff at Mt.
[360:59.27]Kongo.
[360:59.53]Perhaps it was carried by the wind.
[361:01.75]It's simply a single pure white pinwheel.
[361:04.27]Only the child is right here.
[361:11.92]So I have two of these now.
[361:21.89]Okay, what do I do with this?
[361:26.09]That's kind of cool.
[361:28.37]Alright, now where...
[361:32.32]Dual Weld the Pinwheels.
[361:40.08]I almost have five skill points which unlocks that super move.
[361:45.48]Probably items up here too that I didn't get when I was in my panic.
[361:48.16]I feel like I've been panicking through the whole game.
[361:51.46]Anybody else feel like that when they play this?
[361:52.65]I feel like every single thing is panicking.
[361:56.55]Every single opportunity.
[361:59.99]What the fuck is this?
[362:07.63]Monkey booze.
[362:12.37]More money, good.
[362:20.74]Can I open this door?
[362:22.20]I guess I can unlock this.
[362:26.58]Monkey crack.
[362:27.50]Oh dear.
[362:38.16]You're actually really not that big of a deal.
[362:40.90]I got a little scared for no reason.
[362:43.85]Black on powder.
[362:44.59]I found it.
[362:52.49]I found it.
[362:52.85]That's what they're talking about the whole game.
[362:55.09]I found it.
[362:56.09]There it is.
[362:56.49]This is the thing I can walk through.
[362:57.65]I can go through that door.
[363:01.25]That's the painted door thing.
[363:03.19]I can go through there.
[363:05.18]Remember he was talking about it?
[363:06.32]Go through the door that has the thing on it.
[363:31.69]Shinobi escape route leads to Demon Bell.
[363:43.06]I don't... I feel like I don't want to... I didn't even see what was up here.
[364:05.20]Alright, deep... up... I didn't get this.
[364:19.11]Um... What the hell does this do?
[364:23.23]This is very ominous.
[364:24.43]Read.
[364:26.19]Do not ring this bell.
[364:28.63]Inviting misfortune is an act of virtue, but only the stoutest of heart should ever consider it.
[364:32.76]Don't ring the bell.
[364:40.90]Do not ring this bell.
[364:44.09]What is it?
[364:44.49]Is it a boss?
[364:52.45]I'm gonna spawn something.
[365:07.28]Sinister Burden.
[365:08.50]What the fuck is this?
[365:13.06]A demonic spirit sealed within the iron bell of Senpou Temple possesses those who ring the bell.
[365:18.98]Strengthening enemies around them, the bell demon confers hardship but perhaps also slightly better spoils.
[365:25.15]Using this item has no particular effect aside from causing the demon to leave.
[365:32.33]Wait, does this... Everything's just harder?
[365:34.73]What?
[365:35.75]Wait a minute.
[365:40.29]Strengthening enemies around them?
[365:44.12]So you make the game harder, but there's a hard mode for Sekiro.
[365:57.37]Holy shit.
[365:58.81]Why would you ever want to have this on?
[365:59.93]Why would you want to make this game harder?
[366:10.24]Now that's like, that's smoking crack.
[366:16.62]Alright, let's go to the secret door.
[366:19.74]Let's see how much harder this guy is in here.
[366:31.63]Okay, maybe more money?
[366:40.68]How do you like hard mode?
[366:42.14]It's pretty hard.
[366:43.86]I'm scared to do what I'm doing right now.
[367:08.49]How many... How many of this is fucked?
[367:15.07]I hate this game.
[367:17.69]Un-fucking-believable.
[367:19.02]Okay, well that's cool.
[367:22.68]Is there anything else down here besides least favorite enemy in the entire series?
[367:27.70]What else is in here?
[367:29.32]Got anything else for me?
[367:30.40]Or is it just fight this guy in here now?
[367:34.24]At least this is a bigger area.
[367:36.61]Well, I've got the means to attempt this!
[367:40.23]I've got the means necessary!
[367:42.03]Bring it on!
[367:43.85]Face your fears!
[367:45.97]Let's go!
[367:46.39]I forgot about his moves!
[368:13.24]How am I gonna stop?
[368:34.97]Alright, so I have the bell on.
[368:38.89]Stupid fucking bell.
[368:40.57]I'm gonna beat this motherfucker with the bell on.
[368:43.10]Okay?
[368:44.08]Are you ready for me to face my fears completely?
[368:49.48]Stupid demon bell.
[368:51.68]It's time.
[368:52.32]Here we go, it's behind me.
[368:54.38]What do you got?
[369:04.48]Oh, shit!
[369:24.22]Let's go, face my fucking fears.
[369:25.74]Come on, man!
[369:27.04]One more!
[369:37.11]Oh my God, oh my God!
[369:38.49]I'm so stuffed!
[370:00.00]I'm so stuffed!
[370:15.17]I got no more confetti.
[370:16.57]I'm so defeated.
[370:19.39]Listen to my voice.
[370:23.65]I don't even know what dimension I'm currently in.
[370:31.80]Do I...
[370:44.28]I have to win.
[370:46.02]I'm panicking so much.
[370:47.46]Okay, he fucking went down under the ground through the wall and hit me.
[370:51.86]I'm gonna start to panic.
[370:53.08]Okay, that seems like something I could not... What am I supposed to do?
[370:57.52]Red sugar.
[371:02.38]What's wrong with me?
[371:05.84]Guys.
[371:09.12]I have to be perfect.
[371:20.01]He's gonna get behind me!
[371:32.52]OOOH!
[372:12.63]Stupid fucking goddamn enemy Coward, please please don't even get out of here with that shit.
[372:23.37]Come on No, hopefully he's I ain't gonna hear that right now.
[372:27.55]I can hear that.
[372:28.29]Oh
[372:45.81]God damn it.
[372:46.31]I don't know what confetti fucking stupid enemies I Can't believe it.
[372:51.94]I I want to see ah that when he teleported through the wall I
[373:00.13]That was such, I wanted, that was offensive.
[373:02.23]That was offensive to me.
[373:03.81]It was offending me.
[373:04.82]I am offended.
[373:05.74]No, I don't want to do it again.
[373:19.53]Oh, fuck me.
[373:21.31]The one thing that I had so much trouble with is, and they put them everywhere.
[373:24.99]Just to make me angry.
[373:25.97]They did that to do that.
[373:27.79]Me, smiley face, whatever the fucking meme is.
[373:34.07]Where's the guy with the pinwheel?
[373:40.47]Where is he?
[373:40.99]He's like out here somewhere, right?
[373:50.17]I used so many materials, too.
[373:52.19]Guys, I'm getting a zit on my face from this fucking stress.
[373:57.80]This is huge.
[374:01.00]I have a huge pimple on my face.
[374:11.79]Wow, yeah, it's brewing.
[374:13.33]Wow, I haven't had like a pimple like that in... Let's see how bad I look on camera.
[374:18.80]You want to see what this game is doing to me?
[374:31.71]Right there.
[374:32.45]Ow.
[374:34.51]Look at me.
[374:35.71]I'm fucking like a shade of red right now.
[374:44.61]Oh, fuck, I'm wearing the same shirt from yesterday.
[375:02.32]I'm wearing the same shirt.
[375:03.80]It wasn't even dirty.
[375:04.50]It was clean.
[375:05.04]It was brand new out of the dryer.
[375:12.38]Ugh.
[375:17.79]I'm fucking crazy right now.
[375:23.03]I got another streamer question.
[375:24.53]I know I'm super into asking about how other people played this game.
[375:30.62]Am I the only one that has gone insane?
[375:33.90]Are there any other insane people?
[375:36.94]I'm curious.
[375:41.81]Definitely.
[375:43.41]I'm the only one that's insane.
[375:56.09]Pure white flower.
[375:56.79]I have it.
[375:58.75]Give red, give white.
[376:00.23]Should I give the white first?
[376:01.49]I feel like if I give the red one, he's going to get angry.
[376:04.92]I wonder if I can do anything else with this.
[376:16.20]Is this the pure white flower?
[376:18.77]He sounds like me.
[376:20.25]Ah, that's... And then I went through the secret door.
[376:24.87]I remember now.
[376:27.07]They are children of the rejuvenating waters.
[376:31.20]And I remember I tried to find a pure white pinwheel.
[376:37.76]A pinwheel?
[376:39.90]Where that child...
[376:41.64]Sure thing, Patrick.
[376:42.82]Can I ask a favor?
[376:44.26]Yeah.
[376:45.10]Could you spirit me away?
[376:47.30]I don't follow.
[376:48.62]I know about you.
[376:50.22]You're a shinobi, right?
[376:51.87]Those monks say shinobi can spirit people away.
[376:56.19]Make them disappear as if they were never there.
[376:59.43]Why do you want that?
[377:00.93]I'm sure that everyone will be wherever I disappear to.
[377:06.07]And then I'll get to see them.
[377:07.82]I'm in charge of looking after the children.
[377:14.13]I have to kill him, but does he give me something?
[377:34.02]You can do that.
[377:35.18]Do I have to?
[377:35.70]No.
[377:36.86]If I use... Okay, guys, you want me to use the tool?
[377:39.95]the tool that pushes people away, I will push him off the cliff and he'll die.
[377:50.19]If I do that, like, wind move, he's going to fall off the cliff and hit his head on a rock and die.
[378:03.43]All right.
[378:04.17]Look, I'm ready.
[378:05.79]But also a little frightened.
[378:08.33]But yes, do it!
[378:14.35]You're telling me... I just want to make sure you're aware of this.
[378:18.62]You're telling me that divine... It is a mild sort of being spirited away that can be returned from quite quickly.
[378:48.61]all right okay go ahead hi
[379:22.99]What do I get for this?
[379:27.65]You don't leave anything here?
[379:28.92]I just, that's it.
[379:30.70]Nothing.
[379:43.08]You get the satisfaction of a job well done.
[379:44.96]Hey, I gotta eat.
[379:48.14]Shinobi's gotta eat, you know.
[379:58.31]Go to where he landed.
[380:06.99]I don't know where the fuck he landed.
[380:08.65]He's in the monkey world.
[380:25.97]SpongeBob!
[380:28.88]I didn't make that joke.
[380:29.88]OK, see, Tommy's in here.
[380:44.43]There he is.
[380:46.47]What do you know?
[380:47.01]No, no, that's not true.
[380:52.65]That guy, I know he looks a little shifty, but he's a good man.
[380:58.02]Kotaro?
[381:00.03]Oh, it's you.
[381:01.69]I'm glad you made it.
[381:03.25]Look, everyone, Mr. Shinobi is here too.
[381:07.40]Children, greet him properly.
[381:10.56]Oh, he's gone.
[381:12.70]He's gone.
[381:14.58]You can't see them, can you?
[381:16.44]Rejuvenated children?
[381:18.16]Yes, you can't see them, but they're there.
[381:21.58]They're adorable kids.
[381:23.60]Right then, I must give you my thanks.
[381:26.52]Tainted item.
[381:29.09]More weird shit.
[381:31.81]Taro from Simian.
[381:33.96]Greatly increases posture recovery for a time, even when attacking or taking damage.
[381:37.74]Did I only get to eat that once?
[381:50.24]I only get to eat this one time?
[381:58.73]He goes even deeper into the fucking Inception dream.
[382:13.04]Why have you returned?
[382:15.12]Kotaro and I both wish to remain here free from distraction.
[382:21.57]I ask that you leave.
[382:23.85]Quietly.
[382:31.67]Where are the monkeys?
[382:33.73]I want to see my monkey friends that I've... Oh yeah, they're dead.
[382:36.35]I slaughtered them.
[382:37.49]Sorry.
[382:38.09]Sometimes I forget.
[382:47.92]Okay.
[382:49.66]I still am... I need one more prayer bead.
[382:51.96]Oh, it's this person, too.
[382:53.04]You got any more info for me?
[382:54.39]You got rice, right?
[382:55.25]Shinobi of the Divine Air, you are welcome here.
[382:59.35]Shinobi of the Divine Air, this time the rice grew well.
[383:04.75]Now, hold out your hand.
[383:06.23]Please.
[383:06.73]Bless us with bountiful harvest.
[383:11.04]Rice.
[383:11.62]I thank you.
[383:12.68]Rice is very precious.
[383:14.90]Please come again, should you want for more.
[383:19.47]Farewell, shinobi of the divine air.
[383:22.04]May the harvest be plentiful wherever your path may lead.
[383:25.46]That's a mouthful.
[383:33.08]Sorry.
[383:33.46]I did that like two days ago and I had to make sure I did it again to make everybody happy in the chat.
[383:44.63]Alright.
[383:45.91]Loose end.
[383:46.97]Tied up.
[383:49.67]Okay.
[383:51.65]Rice.
[383:57.01]Where's the rice lady?
[383:59.71]She's hanging out.
[384:00.49]I remember freaking out because I was getting attacked by people that were in the house.
[384:11.14]And she's sitting on the edge and I was trying to talk to her.
[384:15.40]Temple grounds thing.
[384:23.99]Huh.
[384:24.83]I don't remember.
[384:25.25]I remember freaking out, though.
[384:31.00]Where does this put me?
[384:38.86]Okay, let's see.
[384:40.52]Where am I?
[384:49.89]Yeah, alright.
[384:50.87]Yeah, I think it's this way.
[384:58.32]Holy shit, guys.
[385:08.15]He's not fucking around.
[385:13.01]Uh, okay.
[385:27.91]That was busy.
[385:38.47]That was busy insta-killing people.
[385:40.73]Well, that's cool.
[386:06.43]There were items over there, though, that I didn't get.
[386:08.39]I was panicking last time.
[386:09.59]Let me just take a look.
[386:15.29]Holy shit, there's so many monks here.
[386:17.63]I have to get the jump on it.
[386:18.44]I'm not going to just do it.
[386:20.28]Oh, this is going to be fucking awesome.
[386:24.47]You know what I mean?
[386:25.45]Only on Jerma985.
[386:26.13]You know what I mean?
[386:30.12]If you're a new viewer, something like this, you'll only find on Jerma985.
[386:34.73]Consider a follow.
[387:00.36]Consider it.
[387:01.40]Just consider it.
[387:41.52]How much of a narcissist do you have to be?
[387:43.26]I'm just kidding around.
[387:44.76]You can unfollow, you can follow, you can sub, you can unsub.
[387:48.29]You can dance if you want to.
[387:49.35]You can... I'm kidding.
[387:52.73]You think I really mean that?
[387:54.24]You don't know me very well.
[387:55.26]You don't even know me, if you think that's real.
[388:17.52]That was pretty awesome though.
[388:22.86]Now I remember, it's right over here.
[388:41.62]Oh, goodbye.
[388:47.47]Hey!
[388:49.03]Those are my friends!
[388:52.43]I don't care about flowers like my brother does!
[388:55.12]Oh, that got me.
[389:29.50]I didn't really explore this.
[389:35.60]All right, can we get the fucking bugs out of here?
[389:41.45]Is this an NPC?
[389:52.33]He just fucking puked on me.
[389:54.83]Oh, take him out for good?
[390:01.14]Nice, okay.
[390:04.92]I thought that was gonna be much more substantial.
[390:06.96]All right, cool.
[390:15.14]Now here's this lady.
[390:19.11]Got rice.
[390:20.99]What are you gonna tell me?
[390:23.57]Fruits of the serpent.
[390:24.55]There are two kinds.
[390:25.71]There are two kinds.
[390:27.99]One is fresh.
[390:30.35]The other is dried.
[390:31.81]It's over there.
[390:33.89]The fresh one is over there.
[390:36.91]Over the cliff through the hole.
[390:40.17]That's where you'll find it.
[390:42.72]Fresh?
[390:44.66]What are you talking about?
[390:47.12]Something troubling you?
[390:48.96]Rice for me.
[390:50.16]That's the way.
[390:51.50]Rice, I say.
[390:52.84]If something troubles your mind, bless me with rice.
[390:56.18]Here you go.
[390:57.48]Here's some rice.
[390:59.96]Oh, there's no doubt.
[391:01.38]This is the divine child's rice.
[391:04.73]Sorry, but this streamer isn't for me.
[391:07.11]Thank heavens.
[391:09.09]Tell me, what do you see?
[391:20.42]If it's fresh fruit you want, fly a kite.
[391:32.67]Wind the puppet, fly a kite.
[391:41.19]The lady's speaking in riddles.
[391:42.89]So I have to make somebody... So I have to make somebody... I have to make somebody do the thing that softlocked my game.
[392:03.33]The question is, where the fuck was that kite?
[392:13.01]I remember it.
[392:13.89]I remember I couldn't escape it.
[392:15.25]It was softlocking the game.
[392:18.77]I feel like it's close.
[392:27.06]I feel like it's down a little.
[392:28.32]Maybe not.
[392:40.75]Hey, guys.
[392:59.50]Why can't we just get pushed off the edge?
[393:13.65]He was so just right here.
[393:27.58]This guy's not even attacking me.
[393:29.16]He's just swinging around.
[393:30.26]Okay, now he is.
[393:31.20]I'd rather stop talking.
[393:32.04]He's waiting for me to talk.
[393:38.84]Relentless.
[393:56.38]Oh shit, there's a fucking other guy here.
[394:00.28]What the heck are you doing?
[394:01.88]I don't know where they came from.
[394:06.29]Whatever the sense is, give him the sugar.
[394:22.78]I'm out of bullets.
[394:24.72]Well, that was fun.
[394:25.44]See you around.
[394:39.17]Antidote Powder.
[394:40.03]Okay.
[394:42.76]I got Antidote Powder.
[394:57.33]I need to get the fuck out of here.
[395:09.04]Alright, what is this last guy?
[395:22.37]I mean, if I'm gonna...
[395:31.57]Really?
[395:48.49]I'm drawing out the end of the game?
[395:52.93]I told you guys this before I even started playing this game.
[395:55.95]I want to play, I want to see all the shit there is to see.
[395:58.97]I just want to go to the end as fast as I can just to get to the end.
[396:01.87]Alright, so I don't think this is correct.
[396:12.74]Let me go to the beginning.
[396:26.19]I like exploring too.
[396:28.57]Yeah, plus I want to make sure I'm prepared.
[396:31.62]Especially with a game that's like this.
[396:33.64]This game is hard as shit and I want to make sure I'm ready.
[396:37.72]That demon boss, it was enough for me to be like, ooh.
[396:42.51]I want to be ready for this.
[396:43.73]Oh, I think it's down here.
[396:49.01]Is it down here?
[396:57.00]Um, what about over here?
[397:00.10]Where's that kite?
[397:19.46]There it is.
[397:23.74]Okay, alright, do I have it equipped?
[397:25.34]I do.
[397:28.00]This is the guy?
[397:29.48]Puppet this guy?
[397:37.32]Now... Now how do I get on here?
[397:49.73]Hmm...
[398:01.66]So that I can jump to that.
[398:03.26]So I gotta go up there.
[398:04.26]Okay, so it's over there.
[398:07.28]This way?
[398:12.80]I gotta get up that way.
[398:14.36]And then on the other side of the building.
[398:24.67]Okay.
[398:28.15]Alright, where the fuck am I at now?
[398:57.45]Found an item.
[398:59.93]Heavy coin purse.
[399:00.73]All right, now where's that kite?
[399:05.62]All the way around?
[399:16.97]Keep going, keep going, keep going.
[399:24.33]Watch out.
[399:25.73]Watch out.
[399:26.23]Bugs.
[399:27.37]Hey, get out of the way, bugs.
[399:30.05]Bugs.
[399:30.47]Get out of the way, bugs.
[399:32.86]Get out of the way, you fucking bugs.
[399:35.16]Alright, now what?
[399:44.63]Fly a kite.
[399:45.25]Mind the puppet, fly a kite.
[399:47.15]Hmm.
[399:53.35]Huh.
[400:03.29]Oh, shit.
[400:04.03]Alright.
[400:04.49]What?
[400:04.95]Okay.
[400:06.56]I made it.
[400:07.24]I did it.
[400:09.30]Now, what?
[400:10.00]Uh, across?
[400:12.50]Fuck it.
[400:12.84]Here we go.
[400:19.52]It's just snap seeds.
[400:20.62]An illusion of... That's the fresh fruit.
[400:25.76]Snap seeds.
[400:28.04]It is technically like vegetables or something.
[400:29.96]No, we're not gonna go down there.
[400:42.16]I'm gonna die if I go down here.
[400:43.36]Oh, fuck.
[400:52.96]Jesus.
[401:00.28]Scrap.
[401:01.53]Here's the cave.
[401:04.47]Oh, there's another idol down here.
[401:06.41]This is cool.
[401:07.59]I like this little adventure to go on.
[401:25.56]Alright, so if it's a snake... Is that a snake down there?
[401:43.09]Shit, um... I'm... Sunken Valley Passage.
[401:59.27]Why wouldn't I walk the plank?
[402:03.39]Oh, fuck.
[402:06.65]Guys, do I jump down and kill the snake?
[402:17.39]No way.
[402:18.86]No way!
[402:22.88]Is it... It's not gonna do the thing that I said was gonna happen, right?
[402:26.32]If it does, I'll be fucking so happy.
[402:29.26]Oh my god, I'm actually- Fresh serpent- That was insane.
[402:44.80]The Great Serpent is considered to be a god of the land, and the heart is believed to be where one's spirit resides.
[402:49.87]While its shape bears similarity to a persmiss- I can't say that fucking word.
[402:55.41]A persimmon.
[402:57.24]In fact, this is the red viscera of a god.
[402:59.22]It is safe to assume that eating it would be poisonous to one's health.
[403:10.31]That was awesome.
[403:10.95]Look at how I'm covered in blood.
[403:20.33]So I have two hearts.
[403:22.51]I have... two snake hearts.
[403:26.91]What do I do with this?
[403:27.95]Look at this little area.
[403:29.15]There's like hidden little items back here.
[403:30.59]This is beautiful.
[403:33.39]There's a dragon's blood.
[403:35.49]And another one of these.
[403:42.42]Alright.
[403:43.32]I need to look at those.
[403:51.58]Where is it?
[404:04.69]Fresh serpent, dried serpent.
[404:10.09]It is safe to assume that eating it would be poisonous.
[404:15.71]Denizens of the Sunken Valley worship the organs, believing they represent the deity itself.
[404:27.45]So do we eat like the dried jalapeno and then like the fresh jalapeno?
[404:31.31]I don't know how this works.
[404:32.19]Do I have to put them somewhere?
[404:33.16]Do I give them to somebody?
[404:43.27]Like, this is a California reaper.
[405:00.93]Well.
[405:03.37]Oops.
[405:25.64]Okay.
[405:28.54]What is down here?
[405:31.08]This one's like green.
[405:32.60]No, it's not.
[405:47.31]Thousand dollars.
[405:48.43]I got a lot of money now.
[405:52.13]I don't really know where I am though.
[406:00.30]A lot of free items down here.
[406:03.16]Scale.
[406:03.78]There's another one.
[406:06.69]Sugar.
[406:14.77]Um... Where the fuck am I?
[406:26.42]I need, like, a better view.
[406:36.13]Oh, nice, okay.
[406:44.38]Um... I've been down here, right?
[406:48.34]Alright, yeah, this is like the poison area.
[406:55.28]Alright.
[406:56.39]I'm... I need... I'm kind of delaying the inevitable.
[407:02.13]I do want one more prayer bead before I fight that boss.
[407:13.81]And there's one more mini boss that I think I missed.
[407:25.14]I'm trying to remember.
[407:25.96]I got the drunk guy.
[407:32.32]Inside.
[407:33.06]Maybe in here?
[407:45.12]No, I'm not fighting the headless.
[407:49.03]Is she in a castle?
[407:54.29]Let's go this way.
[407:59.07]I've not gone over here yet.
[408:01.80]Since the... Whatever happened.
[408:04.84]It was like change.
[408:05.74]The world changed.
[408:06.86]Is he really just sitting here waiting for me?
[408:16.55]How would you know I was here?
[408:21.05]Oh, fuck.
[408:39.93]I'm slowing down, boys and girls.
[408:49.00]Yeah, I'm slowing down.
[408:50.06]I can feel it.
[408:53.40]The second wind.
[408:54.16]No!
[408:54.46]I didn't want to do that.
[408:55.04]I wanted to hit Resurrect.
[408:55.90]Fuck.
[409:00.48]Yeah, I think this is... I'm slowing down.
[409:09.08]We're getting to that point where it might be I gotta take a break.
[409:13.04]And that means it's the end of the stream.
[409:15.97]I want to keep playing, though, but my goddamn gamer fatigue is settling in hard.
[409:37.50]He just pretty much said the line.
[409:42.64]If you're good at stuff.
[409:55.19]Smoke some crack for a gamer boost.
[409:58.86]Well, you guys are gonna be on this for a while, huh?
[410:08.02]This is down to the monkey area.
[410:10.21]No, I'm gonna go back this way.
[410:23.43]Huh?
[410:26.97]Gamer fatigue is set in Linden.
[410:28.18]I'm fighting enemies that don't exist.
[410:29.26]I don't know.
[410:38.99]Have I looked in here?
[410:39.65]There's tons of shit on the ground here.
[410:46.79]What the fuck is happening?
[410:51.89]Is there a... is there a... is there a headless in the water?
[411:00.23]They're just everywhere!
[411:02.97]What the fuck?
[411:04.15]Jesus.
[411:26.43]Anything else?
[411:37.25]What's this?
[411:38.83]Alright, get this fucking monster away from me.
[411:43.43]Get out of here!
[411:44.09]These guys are just sitting in here all game.
[411:53.21]Where is he?
[411:58.82]Oh, oh god, underwater.
[412:00.02]Look at those stupid fishes here, too.
[412:02.26]No, stop diving out of the water!
[412:04.92]Dude.
[412:05.40]I'm not supposed to get everything.
[412:12.29]He only has one bar.
[412:16.63]This is like a black hole move.
[412:38.17]That was a terrible place to drink, and I know it.
[412:41.35]There he goes.
[412:53.94]You guys keep doing the wave your hair move.
[413:12.06]Do the grab.
[413:12.68]That's the easiest thing to dodge.
[413:28.76]Greedy!
[413:30.97]He's dead.
[413:32.05]Okay, that was so much easier than the other ones.
[413:38.09]No fog wall with no dodging.
[413:49.20]Okay, this is just another one of these.
[413:51.86]Reduces vitality damage taken from physical attacks.
[413:54.02]Consumes spirit elements to use repeatedly.
[413:55.84]So these are just candies that I can use whenever I want.
[414:02.97]But that's not really what I'm looking for.
[414:04.35]I wanted beads.
[414:08.03]I've killed, like, okay, since the demon, I've killed like four or five mini-bosses and I've only got one bead.
[414:19.55]Nothing else down here.
[414:24.58]Did I beat the red demon?
[414:25.58]No.
[414:26.14]I stopped fighting against the red demon.
[414:28.92]And I started doing other content.
[414:32.09]To take a break from it.
[414:32.93]Because I was hopefully going to get some more stats.
[414:41.18]But it doesn't seem like that's the case at the moment.
[414:50.12]I got you.
[414:50.98]Got to jump on you this time.
[414:57.50]Oh, shit.
[414:58.43]Um...
[415:25.13]The elbow drop.
[415:26.85]Alright.
[415:27.73]Opportunity comes knocking.
[415:32.15]No!
[415:32.59]I couldn't get a stealth!
[415:36.29]It's been a while since I fought you.
[415:37.76]What the hell?
[415:38.26]You got like grabs and shit, right?
[415:50.62]If I remember this guy, you don't parry.
[415:51.92]You just kind of dance around him.
[415:53.95]He goes in for these grabs.
[415:55.83]Take the item.
[415:59.49]That's not good.
[416:00.25]He lost the lock on there.
[416:01.27]Oh, you're stuck.
[416:20.78]Alright, so far so good.
[416:26.50]Do something, do something, do something, do something, DO SOMETHING, DO SOMETHING!
[416:29.30]Fine, I will!
[416:31.60]And... Uhhhh... Still going!
[416:42.43]I'm still flying!
[416:43.53]I'm still going!
[416:45.01]When am I gonna end up here?
[416:46.17]Swimming!
[416:46.57]And he's dead.
[416:55.28]He speared me through the mouth.
[416:56.46]I went through it.
[416:58.10]He just, like... That was fucking bullshit.
[417:12.03]I had that going, too.
[417:12.95]It was just fine.
[417:14.43]Alright, well now... That's kind of the nail in the coffin for me, I think.
[417:20.21]No, it's not.
[417:20.73]Let me kill that guy.
[417:35.98]Shit, I thought I could sneak up on him.
[417:49.67]Gotta finish the game today.
[418:00.38]I don't know, that's gonna be tricky, man.
[418:12.79]So I don't think that's possible.
[418:24.91]Keep track here.
[418:47.21]It does have a little funky of a hitbox, I remember.
[418:54.45]Wow, that was... damn.
[419:01.45]I'm being too funky with it, just kill him!
[419:10.22]I'm trying to be too fancy with it, like, just fucking... it's a tiny room, man, it's... But, just fucking kill him, man.
[419:29.15]Wow.
[419:37.07]He just spun around in mid-air.
[419:50.59]all right part two we do it again
[420:18.29]I don't want to get stuck on shit.
[420:58.36]Whoa!
[420:58.84]We didn't get affected by that one!
[421:00.44]It's already dead.
[421:05.14]Prayer bead.
[421:05.63]Let's go.
[421:05.99]Prayer bead.
[421:09.47]Yes.
[421:13.89]Yes.
[421:14.47]Ooh, that's medicine rank 3.
[421:19.31]Increases the healing effect of recovery items.
[421:20.95]That's huge.
[421:33.56]Alright, awesome.
[421:36.60]Is there a chest in here?
[421:37.36]Did I get this already?
[421:40.84]I'm gonna pee my pants.
[421:43.30]I really might like pee.
[421:46.88]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[421:47.76]Alright, I was there already.
[421:54.87]This is where I came from.
[422:04.81]Can I go up from here?
[422:05.83]I thought I could.
[422:06.39]Something going on out here.
[422:15.85]This is the front door.
[422:20.87]Is there a boss out here?
[422:22.25]A mini-boss, maybe?
[422:23.53]Or just a fight?
[422:24.44]I think it's just a fight.
[422:34.55]That's too many.
[422:36.45]I don't think I'm gonna be able to fight all that shit.
[422:39.49]Not a chance.
[422:46.06]I will go in here though.
[422:50.00]I don't have time to listen to you talk, I gotta activate this.
[422:55.72]Oh no.
[423:01.34]I can't believe we missed.
[423:06.57]That's me!
[423:09.31]Oh, that Mudwall.
[423:22.20]How about Mud of the Castle outskirts, for a shield?
[423:30.66]Mudwall.
[423:32.82]What's, what's, is this the Mudwall?
[423:40.83]I already did this.
[423:45.29]That looks like a boss.
[423:47.68]It's not.
[423:50.78]Oh, that already did it.
[423:51.86]That guy sucks.
[423:58.14]He was so cool looking too.
[423:59.96]You can't fight the continuous hold down fucking WM1 Pyro.
[424:06.16]See, he's still going.
[424:07.19]He's still holding down the button.
[424:08.45]You didn't even realize he killed that guy.
[424:13.52]Well... Uh, I'm just gonna go get the money.
[424:17.88]Alright, I'm gonna pee, and then we're gonna do... We're gonna... What do I want to do here?
[424:31.79]How much... Okay, I know that this... Do I do... Do I just stream tomorrow?
[424:35.89]Just stream... Just do it again.
[424:36.70]We'll go three days in a row.
[424:39.28]Let's do it.
[424:39.84]You know what I'm saying?
[424:46.06]That's fine.
[424:46.70]Like, this is... This is Sekiro, man.
[424:51.18]I will... Okay.
[424:51.88]I'm gonna go pee.
[424:52.58]I'm gonna come back.
[424:53.12]I'm gonna tempt the demon.
[424:54.86]A couple of times.
[424:56.16]I'll give him a good solid few tries.
[424:59.55]And then I'm gonna turn... I'm gonna call it a night.
[425:01.55]We'll be live tomorrow.
[425:04.39]And we're gonna go keep going.
[425:15.74]Oh, that's too many.
[425:28.45]Dammit.
[425:39.07]Not a place I want to be right now.
[425:43.01]Oh, fuck this.
[425:43.78]Alright, okay.
[425:47.99]Hold on, I can't do that, can I?
[425:54.41]Well, I'm not even going to get a chance to see it.
[425:55.87]Alright, let me go pee.
[425:56.69]I'm going to try the demon boss again.
[425:57.77]This is kind of futile behavior, what I'm doing right now.
[426:01.38]I'll be right back.
[426:02.20]I'm going to pee.
[426:06.80]And we'll fight the demon again.
[426:08.38]We'll try.
[429:03.40]I had to get a glass of water, too.
[429:04.68]Alright, I'm ready to give it a couple of solid tries.
[429:16.83]So, let's just go.
[429:17.99]Let me change.
[429:21.93]This one.
[429:27.25]Three of these.
[429:32.84]Although... What about some of these things?
[429:37.68]What are they?
[429:42.88]This is... No, this is stealth.
[429:43.98]Reduces vitality damage.
[429:50.71]I might be worth using these.
[429:55.81]They take spirits, but all my tools are...
[430:00.73]Although, wait, wait.
[430:01.35]Finger whistle.
[430:01.95]Didn't I get something?
[430:02.83]My god, like a new thing for the... Didn't I get a finger whistle upgrade or something?
[430:14.70]What was it?
[430:20.29]Wasn't it like, oh, do this to a beast and... Oh, it was a ring.
[430:24.99]Okay.
[430:25.09]Okay.
[430:32.04]Is it one of those scenarios where I have to upgrade it?
[430:34.18]What the hell is it?
[430:45.17]Let's do this first.
[430:54.21]That's a lot more health and vitality.
[430:56.01]Okay, great.
[430:56.76]Alright.
[431:08.15]This is five, not available.
[431:11.11]Why?
[431:12.95]Oh, I need this too.
[431:28.28]Let me go... Let me go to... Let me look at the upgrades, Fran.
[431:39.40]How am I doing?
[431:39.86]I'm doing good.
[431:41.08]Hope you're doing good too.
[431:43.48]How are you?
[431:56.31]Yeah, okay, so you actually have to upgrade it through the tree.
[432:02.76]Shit.
[432:06.48]I mean, I can get it.
[432:10.72]I can actually get this.
[432:12.12]It's gonna cost some money.
[432:24.95]Buy three of these, thousand bucks, and then I can do it.
[432:31.97]Can be used to drive beasts mad and to torment Apparition-type enemies.
[432:41.26]I wonder how much that is for materials, though.
[432:43.56]That doesn't seem like that much.
[432:45.36]I can still do this.
[432:46.82]I'm gonna go for it.
[432:50.89]So it's 600... 1600... 27... That's a lot of money.
[432:53.37]Do I have that money?
[432:56.47]What do I have for money right now?
[433:10.04]2,000.
[433:10.26]Yeah, I got the money.
[433:18.52]I got the money.
[433:19.50]Let's do it.
[433:20.66]How much do I need exactly?
[433:22.02]I need 18.
[433:24.08]Let's see.
[433:26.24]Let's do the actual math here.
[433:30.43]So I need this.
[433:31.19]And then this.
[433:40.50]What does this do?
[433:45.30]So this actually, I could have used this an hour ago.
[433:47.46]So I need to buy three gunpowders.
[433:57.90]Which you should have them over here.
[434:03.57]Protects from terror.
[434:04.37]That would have been great.
[434:07.85]No, no, no, stay.
[434:08.93]Don't go anywhere.
[434:10.15]I need you here to sell me things.
[434:11.99]So it was... Oh no, it's iron.
[434:13.63]So I needed three of these.
[434:15.53]Please notice me.
[434:16.79]Hey.
[434:35.99]How are you?
[434:36.35]Alright, so that's 3, 450.
[434:40.21]I think I should still have enough money.
[434:50.53]Panic.
[434:56.12]Okay, I need another 200 bucks.
[434:59.14]You're killing me here.
[435:00.02]You're killing me.
[435:05.61]Ah, fuck.
[435:05.99]Whatever.
[435:06.31]I need to do this anyways.
[435:07.41]There we go.
[435:15.73]Now I need... $1,200.
[435:16.31]$1,200.
[435:16.33]So that's... $1,000...
[435:35.74]5, 10, 15... I'm just going to have to sell some shit.
[435:39.08]Because I can do... Nah.
[435:49.35]No, I don't need to.
[435:50.25]I'm just going to use another pack.
[435:58.43]Whatever, I'll buy something else too.
[436:03.39]Here it is.
[436:03.86]I hope this is worth it.
[436:07.49]Drive beast mad into torment apparition type enemies.
[436:11.53]I hope this is worth doing.
[436:13.76]This is a lot of money and this is a lot of resources.
[436:17.74]It's done.
[436:22.26]Malkontent.
[436:34.81]Malkontent.
[436:40.57]Let's hope it was worth it.
[436:46.44]I wonder how it works.
[436:47.30]And how much money?
[436:47.76]I got some money.
[436:48.26]Let's go back here.
[436:54.51]Any more business?
[436:58.08]all right um I'm gonna buy I'm just gonna buy like I'm gonna buy one of these just in case for some reason this guy goes away what else do I have antidote powder five I got plenty antidote pacify let's get another one of these in fact until next time I think yeah I'm you know just because I'm just gonna do it I you might think I'm stupid or crazy you mean you think he's crazy
[437:24.16]But... I... I want, like, more of these.
[437:34.79]I know I have the potion, but I still... I think they're so useful.
[437:41.39]Now.
[437:44.15]It's time.
[437:45.79]For an attempt.
[437:46.57]Let me look at the upgrade screen one more time.
[437:53.23]I want this.
[437:53.89]I can do this.
[437:54.95]I just need 1500, and I need one more of those salt packets.
[437:59.45]It's my favorite item in the game.
[438:02.43]Over here is... This is the fire attack one, but I can't even get this, even if I wanted to.
[438:12.18]I'm apparently missing a prosthetic tool, which I would have to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then it unlocks this.
[438:18.20]So I can't get this.
[438:27.08]We're gonna have to go for it.
[438:31.02]With what I got.
[438:35.14]I don't have that tool.
[438:36.32]I don't know what it is.
[438:37.16]I don't know where it is.
[438:40.03]Let's see what I have.
[438:42.35]Stream's not gonna be that much longer.
[438:43.69]I'm just gonna try... We'll go again tomorrow.
[438:47.69]Try to clean it up, finish it all up.
[438:55.04]So, it was... What was it?
[439:04.47]Claims of Hatred.
[439:15.43]Let's see, I'm, I... This was a lot of money.
[439:18.56]I want to see what this does.
[439:19.86]Demon of Hatred.
[439:24.38]What does it do?
[439:31.92]Pretty useful.
[439:33.16]Pretty useful.
[439:33.82]How often can I do that?
[439:39.92]I wonder if it's on a cooldown.
[439:47.17]What's the hell far away?
[439:50.51]I can do it from pretty far away.
[439:51.69]It's alright.
[439:56.95]It's not bad.
[439:58.07]Can I do it again immediately?
[440:03.65]You can.
[440:05.77]Okay, so... Interesting.
[440:11.76]I just wanted to see what it did.
[440:20.38]This is not a real attempt.
[440:26.29]Wasting Spirit Emblems?
[440:27.23]I need to know what it did.
[440:28.65]If that wasn't it, just go for it.
[440:36.56]I've got plenty of spirit, I've been collecting them the whole game, haven't I?
[440:39.10]Alright, here we go, let's go!
[440:42.08]Ooh, thanks, unseen aid!
[440:43.32]Bingo!
[440:45.51]Bingo, let's just try it, how long does it last?
[440:52.55]We're going with just random shit here, guys, we're going for weird shit.
[441:08.93]I didn't block it.
[441:09.85]I thought I did.
[441:12.13]I thought I blocked it.
[441:31.74]Ah, shit.
[441:32.60]A little rusty.
[441:34.00]A little rusty.
[441:56.04]Going uphill, though.
[441:56.94]I don't like this.
[442:03.26]Fuck.
[442:03.50]Just gonna back it up after a bit.
[442:20.99]Throw him.
[442:42.05]Nacho.
[442:42.67]Now it's a coffee punter.
[442:51.75]He hasn't done that in a while.
[443:07.69]Ooh, that was close.
[443:18.05]Ah, fuck.
[443:18.73]Man, goddammit.
[443:20.61]Fucking hell.
[443:21.51]Come on.
[443:23.07]It's that one move.
[443:25.64]Like, that sucks.
[443:26.70]It just does.
[443:27.40]That move sucks.
[443:29.30]That's an undeniably fucking shit move.
[443:39.35]It's going well too.
[444:03.05]Should have waited.
[444:14.97]Oh, fuck.
[444:18.93]Dude, you got fucking next level, man.
[444:35.07]So, in phase two, he doesn't throw the balls anymore.
[444:41.87]He does that weird, like, full call in front of me.
[444:48.08]Oh, I don't want to use it.
[445:19.24]Gotta get the first two... I gotta get the first phase down without drinking more than a couple.
[445:25.60]It's a long way to go.
[445:26.46]No, no, no.
[445:31.04]Man, if I could... If I could just kill her.
[445:36.26]Like, it's... Like, that move is... It just lingers for... The hitbox lingers for so long.
[445:44.48]Even when he's, even if you dodge it.
[445:46.32]So if you dodge it, even with iframes, for like a, maybe another tenth of a second, two tenths of a second after, it hits you.
[445:59.34]It's almost like you should maybe even just run to his right.
[446:05.73]I don't think that move, I don't think you can dodge parry, I don't think you have to just get away from that move.
[446:09.81]It's so hard to determine when it's going to happen, because it takes not even a second to do it.
[446:14.32]He's just like, ah!
[446:16.46]So you can be, just your brain just decides in a second that you have to dodge it just because it happened so quickly.
[446:40.17]There it is again.
[446:40.79]See what I mean?
[446:41.38]It's just, fuck man, it happens so quickly, it's hard to react to.
[446:52.21]And that was with the fire resistance.
[447:25.01]What the fuck happened?
[447:31.40]Fuck.
[447:34.08]I didn't have time to do that.
[447:46.97]Fuck.
[447:48.13]Ah, god damn it.
[447:48.91]It was going low.
[447:58.42]I don't like how you can't go for his legs.
[448:01.41]You shouldn't be able to.
[448:33.10]There it is!
[448:33.92]Alright.
[448:34.86]No!
[448:35.30]He does it both ways.
[448:36.64]I don't know, man.
[448:37.32]You gotta run!
[448:54.42]Fuck!
[448:54.64]Deflected?
[448:55.14]Can you, though?
[448:56.00]I feel like I don't.
[448:56.64]I'm not sure I can.
[449:12.56]Fuck.
[449:13.68]Is it a jump?
[449:14.34]It might be a jump over that.
[449:20.85]Fuck.
[449:21.49]Hesitated there.
[449:22.19]I might be dead.
[449:24.41]No, I just barely got the heal up.
[449:29.44]Damn it.
[449:29.98]It's just unforgiving.
[449:31.34]I can't stop for a second.
[449:33.88]Motherfucker.
[449:55.67]There it is again.
[449:56.88]The un-fucking-bearable move.
[449:59.70]That is one of the only things I take damage to.
[450:05.68]I'm thinking I dodge backwards.
[450:11.39]I'm gonna try dodging backwards to see if he does anything.
[450:19.86]I guess he can jump and then grab.
[450:24.29]I want him to do the move so I can just try to dodge backwards.
[450:35.01]It just takes so long to fight this guy.
[450:55.85]I'm gonna try to parry it.
[450:56.59]Let's see what happens.
[450:58.85]Let's see.
[450:59.17]See if I can trigger him to do it.
[451:01.23]Guess it wasn't it.
[451:07.13]Is he gonna do it?
[451:12.82]Didn't get it, apparently, somehow.
[451:18.02]There it was.
[451:26.68]Kind of just waiting for him to do it.
[452:02.03]I can parry.
[452:05.14]I'm not sure if that's going to help though.
[452:17.69]Alright, I can do it all.
[452:19.63]I can block it all.
[452:21.03]But in like game time scenario though, I guess that's better than me dodging and fucking dying.
[452:30.97]But I feel like game time scenario, he does it so fast.
[452:34.21]Might as well practice it, right?
[453:02.06]Oh, can't block that.
[453:03.82]I really want him to crack at that.
[453:17.04]It's worth it, but man, the timings are so odd.
[453:21.11]It's like, air, punch, punch, and hit.
[453:24.33]It's going to take a few times to get that down.
[453:27.01]That's just such odd timing.
[453:41.09]Okay, how did I not get hit by that?
[453:43.57]And then the ultimate ultra hitbox got me that other time.
[454:03.83]This guy's rough.
[454:12.89]I wonder what my official... I wonder... Orphan of Kos was the hardest boss I've ever played in a video game.
[454:23.30]I wonder how many attempts it would actually be.
[454:28.46]For a DLC.
[454:29.37]I wonder.
[454:30.63]I wonder how many it's going to take for this.
[454:42.42]I remember me and Star could not beat Orphan together.
[454:48.72]We tried dozens of times to beat Orphan together.
[454:52.42]I finally did it by myself.
[454:56.00]And it was like, holy shit, it was the hardest thing I've ever done.
[455:01.71]But I'm starting to get that vibe of this might be that from this game.
[455:08.21]This guy is just so easy to die.
[455:10.53]He's got so many interesting moves.
[455:11.79]He's got three full bubbles.
[455:16.53]This dude is no joke.
[455:20.09]Because I definitely probably beat Orphan by this point.
[455:27.60]With this many attempts.
[455:29.08]Without a doubt.
[455:31.60]Because this has to be upwards of 20 to 30 attempts on this guy, right?
[455:54.51]One, two, three, four.
[456:08.60]He does four swings there.
[456:10.04]Oh my goodness.
[456:20.88]I'm mainly just using this to practice that, to try to block those four times.
[456:24.64]It's his sponginess that makes him this hard.
[456:31.16]Yeah, he's got a dickload of health.
[456:32.64]I could do this three times.
[456:34.30]Look at that.
[456:38.78]He's fucking dead.
[456:46.69]I've also seen people say, hey, just get the flame umbrella.
[456:50.63]I don't have it.
[456:52.17]And, like, I have to go get an item that I don't have.
[456:54.79]So what I have with my... I didn't get that item.
[456:59.20]So I gotta fight him the way that I know how.
[457:01.20]Oh, no.
[457:09.04]This is weird.
[457:11.90]It's so odd.
[457:23.08]Also, I mean, I'm gonna have to come back strong here.
[457:25.18]This is one of the hardest bosses in the game.
[457:27.83]And I'm like eight hours, what, seven hours, eight hours in, just like fucking playing the whole day.
[457:33.59]I gotta come back fresh tomorrow, man.
[457:35.43]I'm fucking crushed right now.
[457:52.96]Because at some point, you know, you just have to get sloppy and... This dude, optional... Probably top three bosses in the game.
[458:01.25]Has to be top... Alright, I'll tell you.
[458:03.61]I've... How many bosses are after this guy?
[458:07.01]There can't be more than like... I have to be at the end of the game.
[458:09.51]I have to be.
[458:11.85]Nobody gave me this much trouble.
[458:14.88]So... You think I'm gonna... It's gonna be tricky for me to do this now.
[458:24.53]We haven't even fought any of the bosses, they're all still alive!
[458:27.23]I wanted to practice it.
[458:34.94]Kind of, alright.
[458:35.90]Almost there.
[458:36.40]Had it a little bit there.
[458:41.40]I'll get her eventually.
[458:47.39]And also, maybe don't even be afraid to now.
[458:49.25]We can chip damage just too much.
[459:08.60]Bye.
[459:19.33]And three.
[459:20.19]Nope.
[459:20.45]Fuck, that last one sucks.
[459:23.78]Oh, it's fucking driving me crazy.
[459:39.86]The issue with this boss is that it's a Dark Souls boss in a game with a shitty role.
[459:44.40]Yeah.
[459:45.40]Yeah, that's true.
[459:47.84]But, you technically can parry everything that he does, so... It is like a Dark Souls... I'm the, like, Cleric Beast boss.
[459:57.03]Or Bloodborne.
[459:58.89]But, you can be beaten by the tools they give you.
[460:02.07]It's just really hard to get yourself in that brain, especially... Considering the obvious...
[460:08.81]Man, you want to fight this guy like Dark's only cost.
[460:17.18]Hell, good.
[460:40.57]Alright, there it goes that time.
[460:41.63]I'm still taking damage though.
[460:42.75]I took a lot of damage doing that.
[460:47.37]I guess it's better than dying.
[461:05.05]Alright, I'll do, I'll try, no, this, this'll be it.
[461:07.72]I gotta come back strong tomorrow.
[461:09.10]I'm just tired.
[461:10.66]Tired.
[461:11.86]Seeing the same animations over and over again, and at some point you gotta just fucking close it.
[461:22.30]Oh, I don't know.
[461:38.21]Rage.
[461:39.36]No, do I sound upset right now?
[461:41.28]No, I'm just fucking... I'm getting crushed.
[461:46.56]Oh fuck, I didn't want to do that.
[461:47.78]I just accidentally did that.
[461:53.10]Nah, too much for right now.
[461:55.93]I've gone through so much of the game today already.
[461:59.47]The hardest boss in the game can wait till tomorrow.
[462:03.40]Watch me.
[462:03.74]Watch this.
[462:04.06]I'll beat the last boss in fucking like three or four tries.
[462:07.40]Watch me.
[462:13.58]Last one.
[462:15.40]I don't know what happened there.
[462:26.79]No.
[462:27.39]Oh god.
[462:27.95]I'm so sloppy right now.
[462:35.72]Saving the Bell.
[462:36.38]Bell hasn't been enabled in about an hour and a half.
[463:07.30]Whoa, starting with this.
[463:14.48]Try the other way.
[463:37.71]Fuck, there was no way for me to go!
[463:45.03]On the wall.
[463:45.53]Oh, that sucks.
[463:46.55]If you get hit by that, you're just fucked.
[463:50.79]Oh, I'm gonna get hit.
[464:02.44]No, wrong button.
[464:08.80]Also, he has to go to the right side.
[464:14.89]Then he misses you with the first swing, but then he'll get you with the foot.
[464:18.43]Looks like we're learning how to ride a goddamn bike.
[464:48.14]Didn't get that.
[464:55.16]I'm surprised I didn't get that.
[465:10.29]Fuck, that was a bad time to do that.
[465:11.89]Oh, he just has so much health.
[465:14.35]He has to have so much fucking health.
[465:22.98]You gotta do this three fucking times.
[465:26.70]You gotta do this shit three times.
[465:29.80]I feel like I'm stabbing him with a fucking, like, a little pin.
[465:46.36]No matter what, this is the last one.
[466:01.63]It has to be.
[466:03.07]I'm exhausted right now.
[466:13.56]Didn't block it?
[466:37.92]I tried!
[466:48.49]He's got two head- How many headbutts did- That's the first time I've ever seen him do more than one headbutt.
[466:55.93]Fuck.
[467:08.52]I can't even see, man.
[467:10.10]Fuck you.
[467:11.02]I can't even see the fucking guy who left me free.
[467:14.44]And the fire.
[467:16.98]And the camera up his ass.
[467:33.70]Somebody just said who is this game even for?
[467:41.04]That's so funny
[467:52.97]Who is this game even for?
[467:56.03]Oh my god.
[467:56.81]My mood just increased by like 50%.
[468:04.40]Thank you.
[468:05.62]Thank you guys.
[468:06.32]You made me feel much better.
[468:10.27]That's so funny.
[468:13.00]Imagine, like, coming in here and, like, just being, like, seeing this shit.
[468:16.30]Seeing a guy die over and over and over again at the same thing.
[468:19.03]Spending, like, hours of time.
[468:20.09]And you're just like, what the fuck, man?
[468:21.41]This... What is this for?
[468:29.58]I can't jump over that.
[468:30.90]Why?
[468:31.38]What?
[468:31.58]That's fucking dog shit.
[468:34.70]It's dog shit.
[468:36.10]I can't jump over it.
[468:37.44]That was my strategy the whole time.
[468:45.90]doing that.
[468:46.48]Do you see that shit?
[468:48.35]It's just dust.
[468:49.17]You have to just...
[469:15.53]Oh, this thing!
[469:16.31]Oh.
[469:16.41]Dude.
[469:23.20]I don't understand that move.
[469:25.22]I really don't get it.
[469:27.56]Call me a fucking dope if you want, but fuck, man.
[469:41.55]I tried jumping, I tried running, I tried dodging.
[469:44.93]He has the thing on his head, but I'm not close enough.
[469:51.76]That's it.
[469:52.88]That's it.
[469:54.50]I gotta get out of here.
[469:56.14]It's too much for me right now.
[470:09.82]This guy sucks.
[470:17.99]Play Fortnite real quick.
[470:19.33]Yeah, I've been going for like eight hours of this game straight.
[470:27.35]Playing eight hours straight of Sekiro is the equivalent of playing, like, Picross for two weeks without turning it off.
[470:36.83]And only eating three times.
[470:41.62]This is like playing Minecraft on x5 speed for three days straight.
[470:48.62]But, that's the nature of the game.
[470:51.30]I'm gonna beat him eventually.
[470:57.22]Who is this game for?
[470:58.82]That's so funny.
[471:07.70]There's so much to that comment.
[471:12.10]But we defeated tonight, but we'll come back tomorrow stronger.
[471:17.66]Because that's what Obi-Wan Kenobi said.
[471:22.10]And then Darth Vader fucking lopped his head off, and he became a funny ghost for like three or four more episodes.
[471:28.83]So don't really use that as a good barometer.
[471:42.88]Have a great night, guys.
[471:43.62]I'll see you tomorrow.
[471:44.58]We're gonna try to get through this tomorrow.
[471:46.26]Tomorrow would... It's probably gonna be the last Sekiro stream, and I say that now, but I better be careful.
[471:51.07]Because if I... We might sit here for four... I gotta... I'm gonna, like, do fucking meditation before tomorrow's stream.
[471:58.25]I have, like, another two or three encounters, I think, that are left from where I... How many bonfires I have.
[472:08.22]Eight hours of one boss tomorrow.
[472:09.78]It's very possible.
[472:10.48]We'll see what happens.
[472:16.94]But, take care of yourselves.
[472:20.18]Get some sleep.
[472:21.16]I'm gonna get some sleep.
[472:21.94]And I'll see you, uh, tomorrow.
[472:25.69]And let's get through the bits.
[472:28.55]Shouldn't take us too long.
[472:30.33]There was a ton of community subs today.
[472:42.35]24 hours to KuroStream?
[472:43.13]I don't think I'd be able to handle that.
[472:48.67]Let me get this on the right screen here.
[472:53.46]I'll see you tomorrow.
[472:54.00]Probably around the same time, around like 3 to 3.30.
[472:57.13]Between 3 and 4, you know.
[472:58.07]You know the drill.
[473:02.05]Good night.
[473:03.08]And those of you sticking around.
[473:05.09]Casey had 250 here.
[473:06.87]Just shouting out, a cat is fine for gifting me a sub.
[473:09.93]There were a shitload of them.
[473:10.85]And speaking of subs, uh, thank you Gibber7 for the five community subs right at the end.
[473:16.27]There were, uh, probably somewhere around 100 or so plus community subs today.
[473:22.19]Casey got one.
[473:24.83]Out of the many that were gifted.
[473:27.46]Thank you, Casey, for the 250.
[473:29.52]Somebody, yeah, KDKD.
[473:31.98]Every five minutes was giving five to ten.
[473:35.22]They gave a shitload.
[473:39.28]Uh... Thank you, KDK.
[473:48.17]Uh, Banana Bread II, thanks for the $20.
[473:51.86]Way earlier.
[473:52.44]Hey German, my mom said it's my turn on the Xbox.
[473:54.54]You have homework.
[473:55.80]It's my turn on the PS Vita.
[473:57.32]Mom said you have homework.
[474:06.85]I don't have homework.
[474:07.63]You know, my homework is to... prepare for demon hatred lord thing.
[474:18.65]But thank you, BananaTheBread, for the $25 here.
[474:20.87]He says, I have the high ground.
[474:24.33]High ground doesn't help you in these games.
[474:30.79]Jess, you got it.
[474:31.32]Thanks for the $2.50, Jess.
[474:33.00]Why do we only hear the rumors on your stream?
[474:36.44]And not on Italics's?
[474:39.32]Because I don't have a... Like a gate.
[474:44.38]I don't have like a limiter.
[474:47.02]You hear raw audio over here.
[474:57.19]Exposed.
[474:57.83]Yeah, I don't have a compressor or a gate.
[475:07.90]I want you guys to hear me fucking breathing.
[475:09.76]You wouldn't hear half the mouth noises I make.
[475:17.57]I threw up on this stream, didn't I?
[475:22.11]Almost.
[475:23.31]I forgot about that.
[475:28.64]That was a while ago, but I almost puked.
[475:34.56]Who is this game for?
[475:36.62]I almost threw up playing.
[475:41.43]That's my favorite comment of the year.
[475:48.41]Thank you though, Jesse got it.
[475:50.56]Yeah.
[475:50.80]Uh, I do.
[475:51.02]Happened today.
[475:51.36]When I died to the headless guy like six times.
[475:52.74]Eh, last night too.
[476:13.65]Every day.
[476:15.73]Thank you, Smellyboy.
[476:17.47]Also, Smellyboy250, also eat a big bowl of spaghetti on stream.
[476:20.65]Laughing my ass off.
[476:21.67]I'm not gonna do that.
[476:24.61]Thank you, Sosredo, for the three bucks.
[476:25.86]Jeremy, you sound way more enthusiastic than you have in a while.
[476:29.44]I'm glad you're having fun.
[476:30.36]We the chat are as well.
[476:31.30]Anywho, please accept these freshly farmed ad bits.
[476:35.72]Well, it's a FromSoftware game.
[476:36.94]It's like Dark Souls.
[476:37.78]I'm just... I get really into it.
[476:43.99]I get super into these games, as you can see.
[476:46.87]He was buzzing on caffeine.
[476:49.94]That was me.
[476:50.58]What's this?
[476:50.96]Somebody just said, who is this game even for?
[477:02.84]It's true!
[477:04.04]Who is this for?
[477:05.80]Alright, I'm gonna get back into fit here if I don't stop.
[477:16.51]I was so defeated.
[477:17.89]I wasn't even that angry.
[477:19.23]I was kind of just defeated and upset.
[477:21.69]Not even angry.
[477:22.39]I was just defeated.
[477:23.55]And hearing that, it just brought me back to life.
[477:31.05]Ah, that's great.
[477:33.11]I love it.
[477:34.31]Zoro Carlos, thanks for the 250.
[477:36.87]Jerma, you've looked at a hat in time.
[477:40.62]I hope you aren't just because the ukulele stream from a couple of years back was a mess.
[477:44.44]Keep up the wonderful streams.
[477:47.45]Wait, what?
[477:49.97]Oh, I thought you said, I hope you aren't because the ukulele stream was a mess.
[477:53.57]No, no, you said, I hope you aren't.
[477:56.29]Like, the ukulele I didn't like, and so it turned me off from all the other ones.
[477:59.81]No.
[478:02.41]Hadn't Time has kind of just been on the list forever.
[478:06.63]And it's kind of like if there's a gaming apocalypse.
[478:12.68]That would be one of the games I would, you know, repopulate the Earth with, you know what I mean?
[478:19.39]Like, I would stream that game.
[478:22.31]If you understand even remotely what I mean by that.
[478:27.58]But it's a great game, looks really fun, looks really interesting.
[478:30.04]Just not in the cards.
[478:33.14]Unless I really, really need something else to play.
[478:37.64]And there's been lots of stuff to do recently.
[478:39.48]So there's always kind of something every week.
[478:46.22]But thank you, Zora Carlos.
[478:47.15]Hopefully that answers your question.
[478:52.43]In honor, this is from Al Store, H2O.
[478:54.83]Thanks for the 250.
[478:55.37]In honor of tomorrow being opening day, I want to share a highlight reel I made of your most iconic baseball moments of 2018.
[479:06.79]I think we've watched this before, but I need to watch it again.
[479:29.53]I love this video.
[479:41.31]I love this.
[479:42.69]So much.
[479:55.94]The tomahawk swing.
[479:58.68]is what does it.
[479:59.40]It's perfect.
[480:01.02]Thank you for that.
[480:06.66]Here you go, if you want a link.
[480:10.36]Look at me!
[480:10.97]Oh, I didn't think I was gonna catch it.
[480:14.35]I don't even know how you guys come up with this shit.
[480:18.27]You just do.
[480:18.85]It's great.
[480:20.65]Thank you, Alstor.
[480:24.27]We had a sea of dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of community subs.
[480:28.19]Thank you guys.
[480:32.14]Thank you.
[480:34.38]There's so many people.
[480:37.72]You guys are fucking amazing.
[480:38.66]Thank you for continuing to support this channel.
[480:42.41]Pika Banana, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[480:44.91]Hey, Jerma, I wanted to watch you finish Sekiro, but I have to miss probably the whole stream today.
[480:48.71]Well, don't worry, because I didn't finish it.
[480:50.69]We'll definitely catch the VOD later, so I wanted to pop in to show my appreciation.
[480:54.27]Thank you, Pika.
[480:56.84]I didn't finish it.
[480:58.92]We probably have another stream worth
[481:02.23]And if not, then guess what?
[481:03.79]After I beat Sekiro, you know, let's say it's like a three to four hour, like beat a bunch of bosses and I'm exhausted and it's been like three hours or four hours.
[481:11.93]I'm just going to play Picross.
[481:13.21]We're going to end the Sekiro stream by playing like an hour or two of Picross.
[481:17.19]And I'm going to just like fucking slug in the chair.
[481:24.98]So depending on how long it takes tomorrow, well, it's not... Okay, if I beat the game in like an hour and a half, I'm not just going to turn off the stream.
[481:32.49]So we'll at least do something for a couple hours afterwards.
[481:38.87]Hey, FrodeonWeapon, thanks for the $2.50.
[481:40.43]Happy Wednesday.
[481:41.47]Jeremy Hart, I got to get out of here before I spoil any more of this game for myself.
[481:44.68]Great stream so far.
[481:45.70]Lots of energy.
[481:49.48]Yeah, I love this game.
[481:52.98]It's just exhausting.
[481:57.43]There's only so much of it I can take before it's, you know, you got to come back fresh and I'll be just as energetic tomorrow.
[482:02.68]Watch.
[482:04.08]Full night's sleep, some food.
[482:06.76]Bingo.
[482:07.76]I will be, the breath of air will be put into my lungs.
[482:16.21]And yeah, if you don't want to watch the streams because you don't want to see what's going on, then I totally understand.
[482:23.93]I mean, I would hate for somebody to be excited about playing this game and then they click on the stream and they see me fighting the demon of hatred and they're like, well, I know that's in the game now.
[482:37.42]So I get it.
[482:38.12]I completely get it.
[482:40.78]Those of you that have been watching through this whole thing, I hope you're enjoying it.
[482:46.00]I hope you're having fun.
[482:47.18]I hope you think it's interesting.
[482:50.27]Can you blur out the spoilers?
[482:51.85]I'll try next time.
[482:54.65]Garfield, a Monday killer.
[482:55.61]Thanks for the 250.
[482:57.18]Hey, I'm Garf.
[482:58.22]I'm not so Garf.
[482:59.48]And I'm the Garf Garfs.
[483:01.52]Welcome back to more of this game.
[483:02.76]I'm Garf and this is Garf.
[483:03.88]And today we're playing Sekiro Shadows Die Twice.
[483:06.59]Actually, we lied.
[483:07.35]We're watching Jerma play it.
[483:08.51]Also, there's only one Garf.
[483:09.99]Sorry I lied to all of you.
[483:12.71]You know, but how do can I make it?
[483:14.99]How can a cat make it in this town without a little fibbing?
[483:18.01]Maybe one day chat can forgive me for my crimes against feline kind.
[483:22.75]Remember that time when Germ mauded me?
[483:24.57]He immediately revoked it.
[483:25.83]I cried for weeks.
[483:26.63]I never did that.
[483:27.79]When did I maud you?
[483:29.97]When did I ever maud Garfield, the Monday killer?
[483:35.68]Did I?
[483:36.08]I don't think I did that.
[483:37.00]That had to have been three years ago.
[483:45.75]Did I?
[483:46.33]Maybe I did.
[483:48.23]What a monster.
[483:50.23]Give it back.
[483:52.55]Probably.
[483:53.25]Yeah.
[484:11.76]Hole of one zombie, thanks for the 250.
[484:13.80]And he says, um, I kept this for some reason.
[484:22.33]What?
[484:27.13]I don't understand, why... Look at that first, like, look at the, okay, stop it at, like, three or four frames in.
[484:36.40]I've got, like, a people's eyebrow thing going here, with, like, this crazed face.
[484:49.82]That looked terrible.
[484:52.62]Thank you, Holobunzombie.
[484:53.70]I don't know why he kept that either.
[484:57.36]Thank you, Schwarzerrid, for the $5.
[485:01.28]Haha, you're so awkward.
[485:04.89]Oh.
[485:08.39]Haha.
[485:09.91]But that wasn't a haha.
[485:12.35]That was just an H-A-H-A.
[485:15.41]That wasn't the emote one.
[485:18.41]That was just haha.
[485:22.24]But thank you, Schwartz.
[485:25.07]Hey, Effectator, thanks for the 10 bucks, Effectator.
[485:28.17]Hey, chat, did you know that you can get 2,500 bits for $25 until the 31st?
[485:33.21]Twitch ain't taking any cuts from it, so if you use bits, hop on it.
[485:40.80]That's pretty cool.
[485:42.20]Wish it was that good of a deal always.
[485:47.94]That is the one thing that I really don't like about bits.
[485:50.85]One thing, it's just...
[485:53.25]If you buy less than like $20, $30 a bit, it's like you have to pay like a 20, 30% premium for like anything less than five bucks.
[486:06.69]That just shouldn't be like that.
[486:08.19]I really don't, in my opinion, I don't believe that that should be like that.
[486:15.83]Essentially you're paying money to pay money.
[486:18.97]You know, you pay, it's like currency trading.
[486:23.30]A dollar is like $1.30.
[486:24.32]That's weird.
[486:30.58]Then allow PayPal.
[486:31.72]I don't want to do PayPal.
[486:32.74]PayPal's messy.
[486:35.03]Donations are messy.
[486:36.53]I see so many horror stories, so many people and like tax purposes.
[486:40.87]It's really hard to, it's just strange.
[486:48.95]You see these people that stream, they get like a $500 donation and they transfer the money to their bank account where they use it.
[486:57.93]And then there's a chargeback and they have to come up with $500 and they may have already spent it.
[487:03.51]So it's just, I don't really, I don't want to even deal with it.
[487:07.61]And then the idea is, well, just wait like 90 days so you can use the money.
[487:15.50]No, I'd rather just not have to worry about it.
[487:23.51]But I do wish it was a little less.
[487:24.91]I don't... I wish it wasn't... 30% or 20... was it 28% for a dollar?
[487:40.04]Bitcoin!
[487:40.62]I tried Ethereum.
[487:42.44]We don't talk about that anymore.
[487:43.72]Remember when I had an Ethereum link down there?
[487:51.65]Two people used it.
[487:53.45]You can go on the blockchain, if you have that old address, go on the blockchain and see like the two or three people.
[488:00.76]One person gave me like four dollars and one person gave me like a dollar.
[488:04.90]It was there for months and months.
[488:09.59]Nobody used it, so I just got rid of it and then obviously the cryptocurrency took a nosedive.
[488:21.74]That's very sweet of them.
[488:22.66]Yeah, it was cool.
[488:24.34]It was cool to see, like, oh, look, that came in through, like, the Ethereum blockchain.
[488:27.96]That's so cool.
[488:35.54]Hey, smelly boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[488:37.30]You took a fight from a fair but challenging boss fight that you were getting better at each time to try and fight a bullshit mini-boss that you knew would get you tilted.
[488:48.40]No, you took a break from a fair but challenging boss fight that you're getting better at to fight the bullshit mini-boss.
[488:55.77]And I killed him.
[489:01.57]Yeah, but was I really prepared for it, though?
[489:05.36]During that, I got the two snake hearts, which I don't know what the hell to do with those, but I still have them and that's interesting.
[489:11.48]Got to see that content, right?
[489:13.92]I wouldn't have probably done that unless I went... If I had just beat that boss, like let's say I spent like two or three hours straight while I was still not succumbing to gamer fatigue.
[489:25.67]If I was still doing that and I beat it eventually and I did it, I wouldn't have seen the snake stuff.
[489:29.71]I would have kept going to the final part of the game.
[489:36.00]So I'm glad I got to- I got some more beads, I got some more items, I got to see more stuff.
[489:44.31]But yes, that did happen, you're right.
[489:46.81]Uh, Shawarza Reed, thanks for the $5.
[489:48.73]By the way, that's awkward for non-boomers.
[489:52.18]There's a lot of boomers in this chat, so I'm glad you spelled it out.
[489:58.08]Hey, Errorless, thanks for the $2.99.
[489:59.78]Jerma Earth.
[490:01.08]Thank you.
[490:02.94]Anonymous Cheer, $10.
[490:07.19]Anonymous cheer?
[490:09.35]It's anonymous.
[490:10.87]Thank you for the $10, whoever you are.
[490:12.43]Anonymous cheer is your name.
[490:15.62]Well, you are doing the thing that you're using.
[490:18.22]Hey, hey, as they say on reddit.com, username checks out.
[490:24.24]Thank you.
[490:26.42]PikaBanana, thanks for the $5.
[490:33.39]You all use Reddit.
[490:34.71]Everybody does.
[490:35.49]All of you do it.
[490:37.01]You were just on, like, Our Games fuckin' ten minutes ago, looking at the latest trailer.
[490:41.82]And you're gonna, like, some of you guys are gonna haha me on that?
[490:52.22]It's Reddit.
[490:52.66]It's, like, one of the most viewed sites on Earth.
[490:55.95]That's like saying I checked Facebook before the stream, and it's like, yeah, Facebook, really?
[491:03.36]That's how it goes, right?
[491:06.56]But I... It's okay, whatever.
[491:10.47]Don't let it get to you.
[491:12.05]Don't let it get to you.
[491:14.35]But thank you.
[491:16.81]PeakyBanana.
[491:18.42]For the $5.
[491:20.44]I'm so glad I was able to catch the tail end of the stream after missing most of it.
[491:23.26]Looking forward to watching you beat the final boss, Germahart.
[491:26.92]Me too.
[491:29.46]I'm looking forward to it.
[491:30.64]But I'm... I might be dragging the Sekiro streams out a little bit, maybe.
[491:34.80]This one, at the end.
[491:37.96]You know that gamer depression?
[491:40.06]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[491:40.92]When there's a new, great, insanely difficult, fun title like this that only comes around once every three or four years.
[491:48.10]And I can see the tunnel.
[491:49.64]The light at the end of the tunnel is there, and I know it's gonna end.
[491:54.15]And it...
[491:55.80]I just, I don't want it to end.
[491:57.42]I know it's going to, and then when it's done, that's it.
[492:02.56]And that was fun.
[492:03.43]That was fun.
[492:04.31]Because a game like this, there's not very many reasons to play it more than a couple times.
[492:17.65]Because there's no character progression, right?
[492:21.68]There's no character, oh, I'm going to use this weapon this time and do this build.
[492:27.00]There's the skills, but you can get most of them anyways.
[492:32.56]I think there might be a couple of optional things you can do, maybe with a second playthrough.
[492:38.83]No multiplayer, so no PvP, no PvP builds, no building a character and playing through the game again.
[492:45.85]It's not there.
[492:47.77]So with this one in particular, the replayability is not there that much, so it's kind of hard to attempt to do like a second or third even playthrough anyways.
[493:00.22]So that's the sad part about the end of Sekiro, is it really is just the end of playing Sekiro.
[493:07.76]That's why I'm taking my time with it, you know?
[493:12.24]All good things have to come to an end.
[493:13.95]Yeah, that's true.
[493:15.68]But this one comes to an end much quicker than, like, for instance, let's say Dark Souls 3.
[493:24.93]I saw myself, even when we did Dark Souls 3 and I got to the end, I knew, I knew it immediately, I was going to play through with a sorcerer, I was going to play through with a strength weapon, I was going to try to do PvP.
[493:37.53]Like, I had, like, at least three or four more reasons to play through the whole, I played through the game, like, three or four or five times.
[493:43.67]I'm not getting that.
[493:44.91]I'm not going to do that again here.
[493:49.15]I might play through this one more time to see if I missed anything, but you know what I'm saying?
[494:05.69]You got a full VOD to look forward to?
[494:07.52]Oh, Kiwo.
[494:08.14]Hi, Kiwo.
[494:10.96]You missed some strange stuff tonight.
[494:15.28]I got possessed by a fucking gamer demon.
[494:20.18]I got taken over.
[494:26.09]I went fucking nuts.
[494:28.09]I was screaming at Chad and shit.
[494:29.97]I don't know if you guys weren't here, but Kibo, if you weren't here...
[494:33.57]I was screaming at chat.
[494:35.31]I was making all these horrible accusations.
[494:39.07]I was at a 10 out of 10 of anger.
[494:40.27]We were fucking screaming at each other.
[494:43.11]I lost like fucking 22,000 followers tonight.
[494:46.72]I kept saying, unfollow me!
[494:48.50]Unfollow me!
[494:49.58]I said it like 10 times in a row.
[494:52.12]I started smashing my fucking hands on my desk.
[494:54.36]Unfollow me!
[494:57.12]Somebody said, like, you suck at this boss, and I fucking banned him.
[494:59.70]I started banning people.
[495:01.76]Every time somebody said that I wasn't good at the game, I banned them, and I said, unfollow me.
[495:05.64]Fuck you.
[495:07.02]It went on for like 45 straight minutes.
[495:08.67]It was terrible.
[495:09.77]I'm embarrassed about this.
[495:21.37]Who is this streamer even for?
[495:30.10]God.
[495:34.66]Anyways, let's put the credits on.
[495:36.26]We only have a couple more bits to go through.
[495:37.48]This is the most neurotic I've ever been.
[495:40.19]Let's listen to it.
[495:41.23]What the hell?
[495:41.81]What the hell?
[495:42.29]What the hell?
[495:42.67]Oh, this is when I started banning people.
[495:44.39]Yeah, let's watch this.
[495:45.17]This is when I started going, unfollow me!
[495:47.37]Unfollow me!
[495:48.51]Ban!
[495:50.03]Ban!
[495:50.43]Ban!
[495:51.39]Unfollow me!
[495:52.43]Fuck you!
[495:53.06]I was screaming it.
[495:53.90]It was bad.
[496:06.73]What the hell?
[496:07.31]What the hell?
[496:07.81]What the hell?
[496:09.29]I didn't even have the confetti.
[496:12.75]Look at my terror, though.
[496:14.07]Why?
[496:14.85]What is this move he's doing?
[496:15.99]I don't care.
[496:20.71]I'll fucking go around in a goddamn circle.
[496:23.39]Oh, fuck.
[496:23.91]He still comes around here.
[496:30.83]Oh, fuck.
[496:31.50]No.
[496:37.22]Oh, this sucked.
[496:38.56]Kill him!
[496:44.06]Hey, Jirba's alive!
[496:45.18]I killed him!
[497:02.23]I did it!
[497:02.75]Oh my god, my body!
[497:04.35]My body!
[497:04.83]I'll be right back.
[497:06.80]What the hell?
[497:07.36]What the hell?
[497:12.06]That was cackling.
[497:17.57]It was right after that keyboard.
[497:18.65]I was like, fuck you.
[497:20.29]Get the fuck out of my chat.
[497:23.91]Relax, German.
[497:24.81]Relax.
[497:25.07]Shut the fuck up.
[497:25.43]Don't fucking tell me to relax.
[497:26.77]Get the fuck out of here.
[497:30.06]What are you, a loser?
[497:30.96]What are you, a loser?
[497:31.54]You're a loser.
[497:33.62]I banned like 1500 people.
[497:35.00]It was right after that happened.
[497:36.14]I don't know, I'm surprised you didn't have that part in the clip.
[497:45.43]Do you get self-conscious hearing yourself?
[497:47.73]No, it's been too long.
[497:48.63]It's been too many years.
[497:50.83]Maybe originally it was kind of like, yeah, I don't really, yeah.
[497:54.71]Nobody likes the sound of their own voice when it's playback and recording.
[497:58.81]They've done studies on that shit.
[498:02.42]But, nah, whatever.
[498:03.84]At this point, it's been like eight years.
[498:07.06]It's just kind of there.
[498:12.15]Anyway, here come the credits, and we only have a few more.
[498:14.41]There was a lot of subs, tons of community subs tonight.
[498:16.39]Thank you so much, guys.
[498:22.81]You guys are amazing.
[498:23.62]16824, what kind of username is that?
[498:28.66]Whose name is that?
[498:29.96]Why is that your username?
[498:36.70]I can't even fucking comprehend that person's name.
[498:40.48]There's like two or three phone numbers in that name.
[498:48.04]It's easy to remember.
[498:49.16]No, it's not.
[498:52.14]Bots gifting subs to each other.
[499:04.41]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[499:05.61]But anyways, thank you so much.
[499:06.51]There's a ton of community subs.
[499:07.70]Look at these names fly by.
[499:11.50]And to end it, Timmy Timtan gave 250.
[499:14.94]Hey, what are you going to play after Sekiro?
[499:16.70]I think you should play Slime Rancher.
[499:18.02]I'm going to play Monster Rancher 4.
[499:21.47]Whenever Sekiro ends, I will see the end.
[499:25.31]Monster Rancher 4 is the next game.
[499:32.53]And if it sucks, Monster Rancher 2 is on backup.
[499:37.61]I'm feeling it.
[499:37.99]That's gonna be a nice relaxing stream after all this madness.
[499:42.42]At VRJosh250, thank you VRJosh, a few minutes ago.
[499:47.92]I started my own Sekiro playthrough and I'm kinda in awe at how well you've handled some of these bosses.
[499:52.84]On another note, when's the next VR stream planned?
[499:55.00]Do you have a list of games ready or are you still looking for recommendations?
[499:59.65]I have... First of all, thank you.
[500:03.49]Sekiro is very, very hard.
[500:07.13]But as long as you can take the pain, you will push through eventually as long as you just relax.
[500:14.28]You can take a break, like for me, right?
[500:17.09]You gotta just go, you have to leave.
[500:19.12]I can't just sit there and fucking bash my head against the desk.
[500:23.46]You gotta come back, you gotta leave and come back stronger.
[500:26.71]Take a break, come back the next day.
[500:28.51]These are games that are not designed for you to beat in one sitting.
[500:32.91]And yes, I know that there's people that play these games and they beat it in like 45 minutes.
[500:37.36]They're exceptionally talented video game players and they are not even human with their reaction times and with their memorization.
[500:46.22]But that ain't me.
[500:54.71]I don't claim to be that.
[500:58.41]I do envy it sometimes because it's remarkable what some of these guys are able to do.
[501:03.89]You gotta take a break and come back again.
[501:12.04]Those are real gamers.
[501:15.52]Yeah, no, it's tough.
[501:20.18]But it's okay, playing these FromSoftware games, okay, there's gonna be like a Boy Scouts Sekiro badge.
[501:27.69]I get to wear the Boy Scouts Sekiro badge.
[501:30.95]When I get to the end, right?
[501:41.04]It's gonna be right next to... You ready?
[501:43.12]Here's... I got like the whole thing here.
[501:45.08]I got my flare.
[501:47.38]Minecraft Four Horsemen in VR.
[501:49.30]I got that one.
[501:51.72]Flamelurker first try.
[501:52.90]That one's gold.
[501:54.00]I had that one embroidered.
[501:56.61]Beating Sekiro.
[501:57.77]Simply completing Sekiro.
[501:59.41]That's worth it.
[502:06.79]doing the bonus round in point blank.
[502:11.62]Incredibly defi- that's- that one's all- that one's silver.
[502:16.04]I wear these every day.
[502:28.39]But for all in all, these games are so popular with, you know, who's this game for, right?
[502:32.29]We made, that was funny.
[502:33.79]And that joke was, was great.
[502:37.52]Or even if it wasn't a joke.
[502:39.98]When you eventually get to the end, you do get to say, I got to the end.
[502:43.64]And it was crazy.
[502:44.52]It was fucking insanely difficult.
[502:47.26]But I did it.
[502:48.92]I made it.
[502:52.06]They should have a t-shirt that you can buy only if you have a Steam achievement that you completed the final encounter, and it unlocks a t-shirt you can buy.
[503:00.70]That's like, Sekiro got good, right?
[503:02.90]They would make so much money.
[503:10.59]Think about the amount of people that would buy that shirt.
[503:14.81]I got good, and it's like a cool design of Sekiro, swinging his sword in a circle.
[503:25.81]Do another hour of stream, please.
[503:27.71]No, I'll be live tomorrow.
[503:29.37]I'll be live before you know it.
[503:30.35]It's almost tomorrow anyways.
[503:34.40]I got good at Sekiro and all I got is this lousy t-shirt.
[503:38.78]People would just put the shirt on eBay.
[503:43.86]It's not 1940 anymore, Grandpa.
[503:45.97]Everyone can make t-shirts.
[503:47.25]Yeah, but if it's officially licensed with an officially licensed tag from software.
[504:01.92]Oh, this game.
[504:08.94]I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
[504:10.88]Kind of.
[504:11.36]I'm also not looking forward to tomorrow.
[504:12.92]It's like this weird angel and devil scenario.
[504:16.21]I have to beat the demon.
[504:17.35]I have to beat the demon.
[504:18.23]I have to.
[504:19.85]And I can see the wall.
[504:20.95]I'm looking up.
[504:21.45]It's high.
[504:21.91]I gotta climb it.
[504:24.27]I gotta get good and get the t-shirt.
[504:27.50]I'll be ready.
[504:28.02]I'm good to go.
[504:28.38]I'm gonna get a nice fucking caramel macchiato from Starbucks.
[504:31.88]They're gross.
[504:32.56]Don't order those.
[504:36.18]And then I'm gonna return that order and just get a fucking coffee, we're gonna get up, and we're gonna go.
[504:44.80]Coming in fresh tomorrow.
[504:47.14]And with that, that's my time here, that's the end.
[504:51.21]Thank you for those of you that have stuck through this playthrough.
[504:54.61]I know that a bunch of people probably don't want to see it, they don't want to see the end of the game, or they don't want to see potentially somebody get their ass kicked, right?
[505:04.01]So thank you for sticking through the whole thing.
[505:09.06]I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
[505:11.50]And the completion of the game.
[505:14.23]Take care.
[505:15.57]Much love to you.
[505:17.35]See you real soon.
