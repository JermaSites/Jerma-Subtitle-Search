[ve:61.1.100]

[00:11.46]What up?
[00:16.24]I didn't think I was going to be live for this, but... I guess we are.
[00:20.35]Oh, that was a loud sound.
[00:21.39]What was that?
[00:22.45]Was that my mouth?
[00:32.70]Gonna be playing Elden Ring Night Rain at launch.
[00:39.33]I thought this came out tomorrow.
[00:42.74]I was convinced this was a tomorrow release, but no, it's a right now release.
[00:47.67]I'm currently in the game.
[00:50.03]Me, Ster, and Poke are going to play it for a little bit.
[00:52.21]I think there's a tutorial.
[00:53.93]I'm going to do the tutorial right now.
[01:01.02]We're going to knock out the pre-rolls.
[01:06.24]Yeah, I'm excited.
[01:08.91]I heard the game is fucking impossible.
[01:15.60]Especially if you play by yourself.
[01:18.67]We'll see.
[01:20.95]It's a very hard solo, yeah.
[01:23.10]I'm excited.
[01:23.86]It's going to be awesome.
[01:25.20]Yeah.
[01:26.93]I got a coffee here.
[01:35.86]I'm going to give Ster a call.
[01:38.59]I think Ster and Poke are pretty much ready.
[01:43.53]I'm going to run around and do the tutorial with you guys.
[01:47.92]Let's hope the ads start.
[01:49.14]They're going to start in about 10 seconds.
[01:51.30]Let's roll.
[01:54.59]I am doing an experiment today.
[01:56.63]I can hear myself in my headphones.
[01:59.99]So if I talk really slow and different, it's because I'm trying to get used to this.
[02:08.75]It's gonna be really hard for me to get used to this.
[02:11.32]It's weird.
[02:12.14]I don't like it.
[02:13.82]I'm the only streamer on Earth, apparently, that does not do this.
[02:17.46]So... It's... I don't think I'll be able to do it.
[02:21.37]I think it's gonna be impossible.
[02:26.46]Get open back headphones?
[02:28.08]I've tried them!
[02:30.44]I tried!
[02:31.18]Nothing works!
[02:45.32]Alright, ads should start.
[02:46.42]If they don't, then I'm going to be very, very furious.
[02:55.70]I can get in the call, though.
[02:57.74]Wait for him to go.
[02:58.26]And I'll just do the tutorial.
[02:59.50]You're not going to miss anything.
[03:02.18]Just the tutorial.
[03:04.03]See if these boys are around.
[03:17.76]let's see hello hello where how come no one's answering my phone call nobody's answering me I'm answering you you just can't hear me because your audio settings are wrong every time you start stream audio settings are perfect
[03:48.25]It's actually Ster.
[03:56.72]Ster, I'm pumping my audio into my head today.
[04:00.26]So I apologize if I'm a little stressed.
[04:04.27]I fucking hate this.
[04:06.99]I then am pumping into your head right now.
[04:10.27]Kind of, yeah.
[04:14.14]There is a tutorial.
[04:15.48]Yes, I'm going to do it right now.
[04:18.35]I'm mid tutorial and let me tell you, there's a couple narrative surprises in here.
[04:24.26]Really?
[04:24.76]Well, let me do it then.
[04:26.06]Shut up.
[04:27.18]I will spoil.
[04:28.34]Don't spoil it.
[04:30.79]Okay.
[04:31.63]Okay, so R1 is strong attack.
[04:34.09]R2 is strong attack.
[04:35.39]I can't fucking do this with my headphones in.
[04:38.47]How do you guys do this?
[04:43.66]Why are you even doing it differently?
[04:45.42]Because I have to have headphones in today.
[04:47.99]To be able to hear you guys and coordinate.
[04:52.71]Okay, every area... I'm going to be talking the whole time, by the way.
[04:55.46]Should I just mute?
[04:58.38]Yeah, let's mute.
[04:59.26]Okay, let's mute.
[04:59.72]I'll unmute when I'm done with it.
[05:00.94]Alright, cool.
[05:03.43]Alright, every area has a number of key locations.
[05:05.43]Key location may be protected by... I'm turning this off.
[05:07.93]I can't fucking do it.
[05:09.75]I can't do it.
[05:10.65]Okay, key locations may be protected by enemies or traps, but they often house equipment in ruins.
[05:15.86]Okay.
[05:16.12]Okay.
[05:16.79]While exploring the field, use the map to track key locations, which can offer great boost to character power.
[05:23.44]Okay, I'm using a controller.
[05:30.29]Oh, there it is.
[05:31.19]We're all muted.
[05:31.87]Is this a bad time?
[05:33.75]Oh, shit.
[05:34.09]Hold on.
[05:34.45]There's a tutorial.
[05:35.37]Do the tutorial, and then we'll meet up.
[05:37.34]Yeah, there's a tutorial.
[05:41.68]Alright.
[05:42.34]Use the map menu to check the locations of allies and learn about key locations.
[05:46.93]Freely place pins to serve as landmarks for explo- Okay, so you can put pins down.
[05:51.75]There's a lot of shit out here on this screen.
[05:54.74]Okay, detailed view.
[05:55.66]That's how you place a pin.
[05:56.56]I would love to see what that is for controller.
[06:00.72]Place pin is R3.
[06:03.22]And you zoom in like this.
[06:05.19]Alright, so let's get a pin right here.
[06:09.73]I thought that was Ster for a second.
[06:11.01]I honestly did.
[06:11.53]I'm not kidding.
[06:18.54]I seriously thought he was in my game fucking with me.
[06:22.64]Okay.
[06:28.45]Alright.
[06:29.51]Plays just like Elden Ring.
[06:32.64]How's the game audio?
[06:33.42]Too loud?
[06:36.22]Does it need to be adjusted?
[06:43.23]You can climb over shit.
[06:44.27]Cool.
[06:44.51]Audio's a little weird.
[06:46.29]It's not loud enough.
[06:47.99]It's perfect.
[06:48.55]It's good.
[06:49.31]Ster is quiet.
[06:50.71]Don't worry, we'll adjust it.
[06:51.49]Alright, you can guard.
[06:52.30]Yeah, we all know how this works.
[06:56.14]So when does the Fortnite map... Oh, the ads just started.
[06:59.06]It's fine.
[06:59.36]We'll just do it at the start.
[07:08.39]Raise the gameplay just a little bit.
[07:12.15]Am I too loud?
[07:13.17]No, I'm perfect volume.
[07:14.75]I can see over there.
[07:18.08]Surge sprint?
[07:21.58]I don't think there's a horse.
[07:25.33]I think I took way too long.
[07:26.51]After jumping, jump again while facing a wall to perform a wall jump.
[07:30.71]Use L to jump up in a designated direction when wall jumping.
[07:34.94]Depending on the height of the wall, it may also be possible to climb it.
[07:38.34]Okay.
[07:45.97]Like this?
[07:48.27]Is that going to kill me?
[07:55.94]Alright, so you cannot double jump.
[07:57.53]You can only jump on a wall.
[07:59.03]This game is fucking awesome.
[08:00.53]I'm so sorry.
[08:01.05]I'm sorry.
[08:01.51]I had to relax for a second.
[08:05.02]I just had to hold on.
[08:09.90]Alright, so I go in here.
[08:10.73]And by the way, if you're good, facecam will turn on.
[08:13.47]Only if you're good.
[08:16.19]Alright, here we go.
[08:19.31]Armaments have special abilities called skills.
[08:21.82]Highly varied and can include anything from powerful attacks, parries, which interrupt enemy moves, and even the application of temporary effects.
[08:28.18]Alright, so it's just like the skills in the base game.
[08:32.11]Yeah, this is how you... Okay.
[08:33.33]So I have... What is it?
[08:38.25]I'm gonna... I can't die in the tutorial.
[08:45.91]Okay.
[08:50.17]Dying in the tutorial would be a huge problem.
[08:59.35]Ooh.
[09:01.23]Dude, it is just like Fortnite.
[09:03.43]Lord Soren's Fire Straight Sword.
[09:05.30]Flaming Strike.
[09:06.60]Defeating enemies restore HP.
[09:09.54]Or Roger's Rapier.
[09:10.73]I don't know.
[09:13.13]Should I just pick them both up?
[09:16.45]Okay.
[09:18.19]All acquired equipment has a rarity and a passive effect.
[09:21.92]Items of higher rarity are of higher quality.
[09:25.08]At lower player levels, some equipment has greatly reduced effectiveness.
[09:29.66]Passive effects are active while an item is in one's possession.
[09:34.21]And the passive effect modifies the stack.
[09:36.17]So you just have to have the item?
[09:38.19]You just have to have the item.
[09:42.88]Okay.
[09:46.69]That's insane.
[09:47.61]You just have to have the item in your inventory?
[09:56.67]How do I equip it?
[10:08.57]Oh, wait.
[10:09.11]Okay, I get it.
[10:09.97]So this is just my hand.
[10:11.01]But I guess this is my three hands?
[10:14.99]Can I swap between these two?
[10:18.19]Just like it is in the... Okay, you can.
[10:21.34]I can swap between three?
[10:24.34]Oh shit, okay.
[10:28.20]Alright, well what should I use?
[10:29.45]What kind of character is this?
[10:40.84]Am I playing a mage character?
[10:48.89]Whoa, it's been so many years and I still got it.
[10:52.68]I still got it.
[10:56.68]Dude, did you see?
[10:57.34]Dude, he parried a regular enemy.
[10:58.84]I can't believe it.
[11:00.10]Dude, we're on a Discord call.
[11:00.87]There's 40 of us in a Discord call.
[11:02.13]I can't fucking believe this.
[11:04.03]I thought he didn't have it anymore.
[11:05.05]I think he still got it, guys.
[11:08.93]Okay, character skills are special abilities unique to each player character.
[11:13.34]He beat Dark Souls on stream.
[11:14.92]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[11:16.18]I did.
[11:16.64]This is back when that was a big deal.
[11:19.32]Okay, each character skills are special abilities unique to each player character.
[11:24.49]The Wilder's skill is Claw Shot.
[11:28.55]Oh God, I'm going to have to remember this shit.
[11:31.14]Hold that and... Okay.
[11:36.30]That was kind of cool.
[11:37.77]Is there a cooldown?
[11:38.51]Ah, there it is.
[11:44.82]Alright, that's pretty sick.
[11:50.89]There's gonna be a tutorial boss, and I hope, of the three of us, I hope I'm not the one that loses to it over and over again.
[11:57.46]You know that's possible.
[11:59.72]Fire pot.
[12:01.01]Warming stone.
[12:03.95]Ah, so it just kind of gives you shit.
[12:05.81]Cool!
[12:08.50]I have 25,000 souls?
[12:10.24]That's... Oh, that's gotta get tuned.
[12:12.90]That's a little over-tuned.
[12:16.59]I think that's gotta get tuned.
[12:19.41]Alright.
[12:19.65]Merely passing through a site of grace replenishes... Actually, you get HP.
[12:22.85]It fills all your status.
[12:24.20]Everything.
[12:25.40]And you level up.
[12:26.34]Okay.
[12:29.62]Spend runes to level up on the level up menu.
[12:31.88]Each additional level boosts numerous stats.
[12:34.75]Each character's stats rise at a different rate.
[12:37.61]The higher the level, the more runes.
[12:39.07]Okay.
[12:40.90]So... Okay.
[12:44.36]So you don't get to choose anything.
[12:46.60]You just level up.
[12:50.56]I don't get to choose.
[12:51.60]So it's just I go if I went to level six to seven now is 26,000.
[12:54.45]Okay.
[13:01.30]The fuck was that?
[13:02.26]Near death?
[13:04.62]Ally is showing location.
[13:06.25]What?
[13:07.77]Is he in my game?
[13:09.75]You can affix your own pins to the map as well as those of your allies.
[13:12.46]You can also stack your own pins atop others.
[13:15.68]Hold R3.
[13:18.62]Oh, so you can be like, oh, I want to go that way.
[13:21.57]I got it.
[13:31.56]I want facecam, too.
[13:32.84]We need to be on our best behavior.
[13:34.26]That's what I'm telling you.
[13:36.20]If you're on good behavior, then it'll show up.
[13:44.51]When a character's HP is fully depleted, they will enter a near-death state.
[13:48.51]They'll be unable to perform any actions other than basic movement and do not have long to live.
[13:53.44]The near-death gauge appears when a character enters this state.
[13:56.60]Attacking will deplete the gauge and revive the ally because you have to attack them.
[14:04.05]Alright, so... I get it.
[14:08.58]So you have to attack the person until they come back to life.
[14:13.37]Cool.
[14:14.37]Oh, Stuart!
[14:14.91]What's up, man?
[14:22.80]So you have three flasks.
[14:23.78]Do you get any more than three flasks?
[14:26.28]Here comes the boss.
[14:27.14]Alright, I gotta be quiet.
[14:28.99]I cannot fail.
[14:30.95]See?
[14:31.19]Look at that.
[14:32.01]I already knew it was coming.
[14:40.20]What the hell did I just do?
[14:42.40]I can't die to the tutorial boss.
[14:48.59]Whoa!
[14:57.09]No, I want to throw the pumpkin.
[15:09.96]How do you throw the pumpkin?
[15:17.99]Nice, nice, nice.
[15:19.57]Alright, up on the D-pad.
[15:23.87]Ultimate arts are powerful special abilities that are unique to each character.
[15:26.53]An ultimate art can be executed once the ultimate art gauge is full.
[15:29.68]Ultimate arts have the power to turn the tide of battle.
[15:31.98]The Wilder's ultimate art is Onslaught Stake, a powerful single attack that launches an iron stake with a great explosion.
[15:41.35]Okay, when do I, should I do it right now?
[15:47.17]Dude, come on, thou art a passing skill.
[15:51.00]Do it!
[15:53.42]I missed.
[15:59.51]Oh shit, okay.
[16:05.12]Do I even care about my ally?
[16:15.75]How do you heal again?
[16:16.90]Oh.
[16:24.57]Okay, well I lost.
[16:25.51]I'm trying to do the tutorial, I'm trying to hit the fucking character.
[16:31.30]OK, can you can I lock on?
[16:35.21]What are we doing?
[16:36.57]Am I just dead dead?
[16:40.75]OK, I can you not lock on to somebody laying on the ground?
[16:44.54]That's what I was trying to do.
[16:49.76]OK.
[16:51.85]You can lock in.
[16:53.19]You can and you did.
[16:55.35]I would did I did I lock onto the character on the ground?
[17:00.41]Is this your first time playing a Souls game?
[17:01.95]This is my first time playing a Souls game in, like, two years.
[17:05.10]I got up to 50% HP.
[17:05.82]That's better than the other horsemen, alright?
[17:09.24]Yeah, I know Star just died.
[17:11.65]I see Star's fucking camera over here.
[17:13.55]He just died.
[17:14.03]I saw it.
[17:15.67]Alright, here we go.
[17:18.27]You lose a level.
[17:19.44]The character's runes, including the runes for the lost level, a drop at the location of death.
[17:30.89]Okay, if character dies, it's just like it is in the other game, right?
[17:33.59]Okay.
[17:34.93]Alright, so now we just do it again.
[17:35.85]Level lost.
[17:36.85]Well, I'm just gonna kill this motherfucker on my own.
[17:39.70]I don't need any help.
[17:43.16]I don't even think I even have a friend.
[17:46.53]Where's my, where's my ally?
[17:48.43]Do I have to do this alone?
[17:50.53]Dude, it's Mark at the Fel Omen, man!
[17:52.13]He's like the hardest boss in Elden Ring!
[17:55.64]Wait, he, hold on, I'm, I'm, he's, everyone shut up.
[17:59.13]I just realized he has, his health is still empty.
[18:19.95]What the hell?
[18:20.61]How do I do that move again?
[18:25.82]How do I do the grapple again?
[18:43.80]I don't remember.
[18:44.96]Is it L2?
[18:47.29]Okay.
[18:47.55]How do you hold triangle and plus L2?
[18:52.66]Is that how it works?
[18:53.46]How do I do it?
[18:58.35]It's R2.
[19:01.48]You died twice tutorial boss.
[19:03.10]No, I didn't.
[19:04.36]Hey, that's better than the other horseman.
[19:09.19]I gotta warm up, dude.
[19:10.05]I haven't played fucking a FromSoftware game in like three years.
[19:15.72]Wait, is it mad at me that I died?
[19:22.85]Uh-oh.
[19:24.76]long long ago you couldn't beat that I didn't see long long ago I played Elden Ring shut up this is important the Lands Between were visited by a great war the shattering as it was known destroyed order itself
[19:55.96]drawing forth in time an abomination.
[20:05.21]Thus fell upon us the night.
[20:15.58]Now heavy rains Harry the region, threatening to wash away its very history.
[20:29.07]The Night Lord does not rest... ...as it ravages the Lands Between beyond recognition.
[20:43.36]But there are those who would fight back.
[20:46.25]I am done and I can invite.
[20:48.39]I thought that was in the game.
[20:49.58]I was like, holy shit, what a weird voice.
[20:50.68]Let me know when you're all good.
[20:54.20]Does it say you can invite or just I'm in the round table running around?
[20:57.19]Uh, yeah, once you're in round table, I can invite you.
[21:01.23]I'm watching a cut scene.
[21:03.52]So how was that boss?
[21:06.14]Fucking easy.
[21:08.14]they are like two hits I think I killed it the will to cross the I died once but I killed a second time fight on I got a first try really till every shred of their being is ground away
[21:32.17]So what characters do you guys want to play?
[21:34.07]What classes?
[21:35.49]I don't know which ones there are.
[21:37.11]You also have to be online on Steam for me.
[21:40.14]Fine.
[21:41.60]And don't give me that attitude, young man!
[21:44.38]Fine.
[21:45.02]I have to come clean because we have to work together.
[21:50.39]I got cut-scened.
[21:52.21]I lost twice to the boss and I couldn't do it.

[22:00.51]Oh, fuck.
[22:01.09]Okay, we'll poke.
[22:01.78]Wait, really?
[22:02.24]Yeah.
[22:06.08]Oh.
[22:07.72]I was playing Elden Ring the other day.
[22:09.18]You know, I'm all warmed up.
[22:12.53]Kind of cheating, though.
[22:14.05]That's cheating, bro.
[22:15.45]Okay.
[22:15.63]I didn't beat him.
[22:17.05]I actually tried to die quicker so I could get out.
[22:22.82]And also, I missed my ultimate, okay?
[22:25.72]I forgot the buttons.
[22:26.48]I didn't even hit it.
[22:28.39]It teaches you it.
[22:29.84]Yeah, but I forgot them.
[22:31.24]It teaches you it mid-fight.
[22:32.36]Dude, Margit the Fel Omen is attacking me.

[23:21.99]Yeah, we're good.
[23:22.71]It's about to get real once Jerma joins the game.
[23:25.43]I tried to drive you to your freaking hockey match the other day and he was pouting the whole time.
[23:30.52]I'm watching the cutscene.
[23:31.80]I don't want to skip.
[23:32.94]I'm an incredible fan of this game.
[23:34.92]Okay.
[23:36.88]Roundtable Hold.

[23:48.22]Yes, I'm inviting again.
[23:49.52]Okay.
[23:51.28]I have not looked around the round table, so I think you can still talk to people in this instance.
[23:55.29]Like, I don't know how to change characters or anything.
[23:57.37]Well, we'll figure it out.
[24:00.50]I don't see anything from you.
[24:04.57]What did you get, Poke?
[24:05.93]Oh, I do.
[24:06.39]Now I do.
[24:06.95]What do you mean?
[24:08.27]Nothing.
[24:09.69]I love you.
[24:09.99]I accepted an invite.
[24:10.81]Love you, too.
[24:11.34]Hi.
[24:13.78]Oh.
[24:15.44]I'm in.
[24:21.79]You're out.
[24:22.74]Apparently I'm out.
[24:24.54]Why are you out?
[24:25.28]I don't know.
[24:26.84]Try it again.
[24:27.26]Okay.
[24:38.25]It just threw me out of the main menu.
[24:41.47]Waiting to join team session.
[24:44.14]You've got a bit of a reputation.
[24:46.78]Connection error.
[24:47.40]Unable to start an online mode.
[24:49.00]What the hell?
[24:51.83]Uh oh.
[24:53.85]Uh oh!
[24:55.32]Your band already.
[24:56.16]Log in!
[24:56.72]Oh my god, I actually can't connect.
[25:00.06]Why were you trying to use mods?
[25:01.54]I joined your game and it turned off my internet.
[25:07.91]Wait, what?
[25:09.27]Okay, hold on.
[25:11.64]I'm just gonna restart the game.
[25:12.62]I'll be right back.
[25:13.96]Okay.
[25:14.70]The guy with the bells.
[25:16.36]I'm gonna read all of the lore and start spoiling it.
[25:21.65]the guy with the bells is where you change your class what the heck there's a tekken character in here let's try this again okay let's do it again stupid I knew this was gonna happen
[25:49.11]You're in a bit of a mood.
[25:50.23]I didn't even get to play.
[25:51.41]I got killed by Margit and then I had to quit the game.
[25:55.61]That's kind of funny.
[25:56.79]One thing I was told that's not in the tutorial is when you're picking up those different weapons and they all have passives on them is that all of them take effect even if the weapon isn't out.
[26:05.02]Really?
[26:05.88]Okay.
[26:06.00]Is what I had heard.
[26:08.13]Let's see if this works.
[26:09.19]Don't know if true.
[26:12.25]Jeremy, you need a bush.
[26:15.93]I was thinking about it.
[26:16.62]Bush light.
[26:18.69]I was thinking about it.
[26:20.45]OK, I'm logged into the game servers.
[26:23.16]Let me take your invite.
[26:26.42]OK.
[26:27.73]I need to send a new one.
[26:29.47]Think it's working.
[26:31.45]Waiting to join team session.
[26:34.94]I'm going to not do it.
[26:35.78]I'm going to not press extra buttons on you.
[26:38.52]I sent you like seven invites.
[26:40.31]Okay, you're here.
[26:40.83]I'm here, but I was there here last time and it immediately kicked me out.
[26:43.33]Nobody sneeze.
[26:44.33]Okay, well stop jinxing it.
[26:45.25]Can you please not show some positivity?
[26:48.44]Can you say something positive right now?
[26:54.35]No, I can't.
[26:54.69]He can't do it.
[26:56.05]He can't do it.
[26:59.27]What is it?
[27:00.04]Okay, that's rough.
[27:00.66]I will do my utmost.
[27:02.70]alright so how do we get this going we only got a small amount of time right are yeah poke has like a hour and 20 minutes now alright so are you in the round table I'm in the round table can we see each other like I'm jumping on the table I don't we cannot see each other okay well there's a bell next to the round table with a knight next to it that lets you select your character
[27:30.90]see a bell oh I see the bell yeah on the opposite side of the white hooded lady we have to pick uh a boss to attack yeah I I'm choosing because I'm the lobby leader we only have one option which is uh we're doing Monster Hunter wilds I know poke loved that we're hunting a typhalos alright so who do you uh we should probably do dps tank healer right
[27:56.19]Is there a healer?
[27:57.37]I don't know.
[27:57.71]Who's this?
[27:58.93]From what I have heard is that a lot of the times it's even good to split up because you can all like go get small objectives done and then meet up for the boss.
[28:10.47]You know what I mean?
[28:10.93]Because you don't like... I think the loot is all the same in every box.
[28:14.61]Okay.
[28:15.19]I kind of like the bird guy.
[28:17.31]That's on brand.
[28:19.73]I honestly kind of like default guy unless I'm going to try bow guy.
[28:23.02]So there's a powerful guard.
[28:30.62]I'll try Guardian.
[28:31.54]I don't know what to be.
[28:40.37]I'm a default guy.
[28:41.47]We're going to probably lose in the first five minutes, so it's alright.
[28:46.17]Not true.
[28:48.70]No.
[28:49.04]I can revive you, so you're going to get back up.
[28:56.06]What about Executor?
[28:59.13]Yo, whatever the vibe is.
[29:05.41]so I should be doing guard boost right I don't know what that means where you go and you dash forward after blocking what is that wait what when you block and somebody hits you and you do the guard um riposte thing yeah what about it I might just go later I think this character is specifically for that
[29:34.62]Guard counter, yeah.
[29:35.26]You picked Birdman?
[29:36.12]I did pick Birdman.
[29:36.89]Just try it.
[29:42.69]And what are you doing, Poke?
[29:45.17]Uh, Raider.
[29:47.84]Raider.
[29:49.56]Okay, I'm gonna try the bow guy, then.
[29:52.44]Alright, let's kill the Triceratops.
[29:53.18]And I can ready us up whenever you want.
[29:55.36]Let's just go for it.
[29:57.12]Yeah.
[29:57.60]Tricephalos.
[29:59.73]If we lose, we lose.
[30:00.47]Whatever.
[30:01.55]He says he cares about the lore, and then he calls it Triceratops.
[30:06.57]I got time to read that.
[30:09.33]I think, Poke, there's a ready up or something you need to do.
[30:13.65]Oh.
[30:14.48]Commence expedition.
[30:17.58]Commencing.
[30:19.54]You guys ready?
[30:20.24]Are you ready to go for this?
[30:21.84]We've been waiting for this for like a year and a half.
[30:23.69]Remember we were on the call and we were talking about this?
[30:26.21]Oh, yeah.
[30:28.39]Oh, yeah.
[30:28.79]I was there.
[30:30.17]I can tell.
[30:30.75]I don't remember.
[30:32.13]I know that we've been waiting.
[30:33.56]Oh, you pick here.
[30:34.42]Anyway.
[30:36.72]Okay, I'll play Iron Eye.
[30:39.53]I guess my ultimate, I jump on everybody and I raise defenses.
[30:50.94]I'm the big dude.
[30:53.26]I'm the cute one.
[30:54.62]Dude, look at us.
[31:05.37]Alright, where are we going to drop?
[31:09.48]Let's go straight to the boss and not do anything else.
[31:11.68]Tilted Towers.
[31:12.34]Woo!
[31:17.17]Yeah, I'm on controller.
[31:19.45]Forgot to mute.
[31:22.90]I'm on controller too.
[31:24.98]Were you embarrassed that you said Tilted Towers?
[31:27.31]No, I coughed.
[31:28.77]Alright, day one.
[31:29.73]Day one.
[31:30.07]Lock in.
[31:30.57]Day one.
[31:33.04]I don't know how we drop.
[31:35.06]Alright.
[31:36.98]I think we just do.
[31:39.37]I see it.
[31:39.85]I'm dead.
[31:40.77]Are you dead?
[31:42.07]Oh, good.
[31:43.26]Bonfire.
[31:43.66]Bonfire.
[31:44.10]Guy.
[31:44.26]There's a guy.
[31:44.66]Guy.
[31:44.86]There's a guy right here.
[31:45.90]Guy.
[31:50.45]Got experience for us.
[31:52.44]Alright.
[31:53.08]Oh, that was epic.
[31:54.52]Okay.
[31:55.91]Our map is, there's, this is a lot more stuff on the map than the tutorial.
[31:59.25]We have like caves and everything.
[32:00.69]We're going into cave.
[32:02.75]I got, check my red pin.
[32:04.80]Let's, yeah, let's do at least one thing together, I guess.
[32:09.54]When does the circle close?
[32:11.70]I don't know.
[32:15.21]Uh, I don't know, but it'll say like day two.
[32:18.35]I don't know.
[32:19.01]Should we pick stuff up?
[32:20.69]Do we, do we share loot?
[32:23.49]I believe the answer is yes, which is why it might be good to split up later, but... There's a dragon.
[32:31.00]Is there fall damage?
[32:31.70]Wait, dragon?
[32:33.89]Yeah, lake dragon.
[32:36.93]Oh.
[32:37.67]Show a cave or dragon?
[32:38.69]Which one?
[32:39.65]I'm in the cave.
[32:41.82]Is there fall damage?
[32:42.38]Are you dead?
[32:43.94]No.
[32:45.48]Is there fall damage?
[32:47.22]There's probably a lot less.
[32:48.10]Oh, there's no fall damage.
[32:49.01]There's no fall damage.
[32:49.93]There's no fall damage, okay.
[32:52.11]Okay, you can level up already.
[32:55.46]Oh, nice.
[32:59.18]Alright, let's clear this cave.
[33:02.45]Cave up.
[33:03.51]How do you do your moves again?
[33:04.39]Triangle and L2?
[33:08.64]Yeah.
[33:09.80]Triangle, L2, and R2.
[33:11.97]Okay.
[33:12.85]Yeah.
[33:15.47]Should we even fight these shitty enemies or should we just go right down?
[33:18.43]Oh, I get like a multi.
[33:20.70]Yeah, no, we're like level one.
[33:22.16]You see how small our health bar is?
[33:25.12]Oh, shit.
[33:25.54]It is really small.
[33:32.17]You're just going in.
[33:33.50]The circle's closing.
[33:37.10]Oh, no, it isn't.
[33:38.10]I'm really taking that way too seriously.
[33:40.76]Okay, I cannot hurt these rock guys.
[33:43.65]I actually do 15 damage to them with my weapon.
[33:49.10]Should I not fight them?
[33:58.29]Why are you fighting over here?
[34:01.53]I got a big guy on me.
[34:02.70]I'm 1 HP.
[34:06.20]Why did you abandon me?
[34:07.82]I'm coming.
[34:13.35]How do I do a special move?
[34:16.63]Ooh, whirlwind!
[34:17.86]Why do we even aggro these stupid fucking rock people?
[34:26.03]We need smithing stones!
[34:34.69]oh they dropped uh they dropped sorcery weapons they dropped bigger staffs that was my ult what the hell is in the way I'm doing my ult I don't know what I just did
[34:59.59]Nice, nice, nice.
[35:01.41]There we go.
[35:01.91]That's how we do it.
[35:03.05]That's how we do it.
[35:03.79]Why aren't you guys yelling?
[35:07.20]I was so locked in.
[35:09.88]I was so freaking locked in.
[35:11.18]Do you guys see Hammer Smithringstone?
[35:13.91]Yeah, what is this?
[35:15.21]Wait, did I just pick the wrong loot?
[35:17.23]I'm just saying, are we seeing the same loot?
[35:20.57]You pick one.
[35:21.92]Oh, you do pick one.
[35:22.90]Okay.
[35:23.02]Do you have to upgrade your weapon?
[35:23.86]But we all got one, so it was fine to be together.
[35:26.78]Okay.
[35:27.16]Okay.
[35:28.83]Alright, don't even aggro these guys.
[35:31.31]I could have got a crazy item.
[35:32.98]There's a bunch of chests in here, man.
[35:34.96]Are there chests in here?
[35:36.32]There's a ton of loot.
[35:37.97]Dude, I am getting so much loot.
[35:39.63]It's a good thing I bought the battle pass.
[35:41.79]Is there actually stuff in there?
[35:43.70]Wait.
[35:45.04]There's a finger seal.
[35:47.87]Ooh, parry dagger.
[35:51.54]Yeah, I think we are sharing this loot, but the actual, like, the ghost loot was not.
[35:55.89]Short sword.
[35:57.97]Oh, shit, I don't want... That scared me.
[36:01.97]I got a group, you'll move.
[36:05.02]Glintstone scrap?
[36:09.62]Uh, we probably should fucking move.
[36:11.58]That sounds like... Where's the circle?
[36:14.73]Okay.
[36:15.17]We're learning.
[36:16.43]Dude, I don't...
[36:18.27]I hear music.
[36:18.75]Stop rushing me.
[36:19.88]Mom, I just got this game.
[36:22.90]Sir, is your mic low?
[36:25.48]It shouldn't be.
[36:26.39]I've raised it multiple times.
[36:29.41]I swear, you sound so low.
[36:30.71]Can you raise me on Discord?
[36:36.82]I did.
[36:36.96]Jerma, do I sound low?
[36:38.50]I put you up already.
[36:42.89]Alright, we'll go down.
[36:44.05]Let's just keep moving down.
[36:53.69]There's going to be an epic boss down here, I guarantee it.
[36:59.78]Well, that giant wasn't the boss.
[37:01.34]No.
[37:06.87]I really like the sprint in this.
[37:09.03]Okay, wait.
[37:10.04]We're outside again.
[37:11.56]Maybe the giant was.
[37:13.22]Is it Everjail right here?
[37:15.94]Wait, you think the giant was the boss?
[37:17.31]You want to try the Everjail?
[37:20.55]There's a boss right over here.
[37:21.39]Okay, let's do it.
[37:24.22]Hippo.
[37:25.68]Hippo.
[37:26.18]Alright.
[37:26.54]Hippo.
[37:27.15]That's not an evergel.
[37:27.85]That's a hippo.
[37:28.65]Oh, that's a golden hippo.
[37:34.52]The circle.
[37:34.98]The circle.
[37:35.48]Oh, shit.
[37:35.76]The circle's coming in.
[37:38.53]Oh, shit.
[37:38.85]We got to run.
[37:39.71]I didn't know that's what that was.
[37:42.74]Oh, no.
[37:43.02]Watch out.
[37:43.26]Watch out.
[37:44.68]We can still kill it, I think.
[37:46.16]I don't know if I can res him, though.
[37:49.90]Can we res him?
[37:50.95]You can take the damage.
[37:52.41]I'll keep the aggro.
[37:53.15]You get the res.
[37:55.77]I'm dead for real.
[37:57.85]You respawn at a thing.
[37:59.38]I think I just lose all my experience.
[38:02.82]Oh!
[38:05.04]I think we run.
[38:05.72]I think we run to the circle.
[38:07.45]We got to run to the circle.
[38:10.85]Right there.
[38:11.93]Alright.
[38:15.74]So that music must mean the circle is closing.
[38:21.71]learned our lesson dude we uh okay alright I'm back I lost a level though and all the runes we were carrying so we're we're I mean you were like level one dude the health bar that health bar is tiny
[38:51.23]Okay, well that... Wait, what's this tomb right here?
[38:53.05]Yeah, what is this?
[38:55.25]Summon foe chasing vengeful spirits.
[38:57.94]Is that helpful?
[38:58.80]Let's try it.
[38:59.16]I don't know how to undo that.
[39:01.64]Oh, it is.
[39:02.38]Oh, shit.
[39:02.80]Okay.
[39:05.33]Does it show the rewards here?
[39:06.67]I lost two of my spirits hitting a wall.
[39:13.74]I think boogers just came out of my nose.
[39:15.16]Whatever.
[39:15.96]Sorry.
[39:17.85]They had to have flown out.
[39:19.35]Hopefully, I'm not in HD on anybody's screen.
[39:22.73]Alright, is this where we're going?
[39:24.90]We gotta get, like, into the middle here.
[39:39.29]So, do we share?
[39:40.39]Did you just get 800 experience?
[39:42.62]We share experience, yeah.
[39:43.70]Just everything we kill, okay.
[39:46.64]What am I... Oh, God.
[39:51.86]What the fuck am I doing?
[39:59.35]Oh shit.
[40:07.68]Going up.
[40:14.89]Nice.
[40:15.23]Woah!
[40:15.49]Woah!
[40:15.93]Look what I just did!
[40:16.59]That was cool.
[40:18.37]We may have overkilled that.
[40:19.61]That was just one guy.
[40:20.65]Where's the rest of the bosses?
[40:23.76]Everybody ulted him.
[40:26.82]Where's the other one?
[40:28.72]How come there's more?
[40:32.68]Yo, I don't even know how to use the smithing stones.
[40:38.83]We're in too deep.
[40:41.91]All this stuff sucks.
[40:45.04]That seemed better.
[40:47.78]What is even the use item button?
[40:57.80]Up on the d-pad.
[41:00.32]What did I just eat?
[41:08.67]How's this guy not a royal knight?
[41:10.80]Your simple ability?
[41:12.98]Uh, hold triangle and then L2.
[41:14.96]You have to hold triangle first.
[41:17.37]I figured that out.
[41:21.97]Ow.
[41:25.98]I'm dead.
[41:28.26]No, I'm not.
[41:33.37]I feel like our next run is going to be a vast improvement.
[41:38.66]Hey, this is fucking fun.
[41:40.36]I don't care.
[41:42.49]I feel like I've learned a lot.
[41:47.71]So many random people.
[42:02.37]I think that gives you a buff.
[42:05.85]This guy is showing no mercy.
[42:08.53]Alright, we got a couple more people to kill.
[42:12.84]I like the music.
[42:14.76]Oh, new bow.
[42:18.51]We gotta find a Grace.
[42:19.21]We gotta level up.
[42:20.23]Big time.
[42:20.63]I wasn't muted.
[42:21.11]I was locked in against that guy.
[42:23.23]I had one HP.
[42:24.78]Chests.
[42:28.72]Oh, the guy's right here.
[42:33.99]Wait, what?
[42:38.42]coming okay I believe in us I'm scared I just don't know the assignment brother we need a grace oh yeah we probably have like a million levels
[43:09.40]There's one more guy, I think.
[43:13.22]How do you use the item?
[43:15.32]Up on the D-pad is items.
[43:17.73]Oh.
[43:19.89]Alright, yeah, this guy's got a ball.
[43:21.15]Careful, careful, careful.
[43:25.31]Do I actually need arrows for that?
[43:35.34]Oh, that scared the shit out of me.
[43:40.06]Special ability, cube.
[43:43.16]That's our first boss.
[43:44.61]We just beat our first boss.
[43:46.13]Circle.
[43:50.21]I'm dead.
[43:51.49]There's an axe in there I can't get.
[43:58.02]No, I need the axe.
[44:00.40]We need a graze so bad.
[44:03.04]There's one down the hill.
[44:04.33]Oh shit, right there.
[44:08.53]At least I got a new glaive.
[44:12.14]Uh, how the heck do we use smithing stones?
[44:16.79]Why didn't the tutorial tell me?
[44:18.29]Ah, it's alright.
[44:19.79]We're good.
[44:20.37]Oh, I just leveled a bunch.
[44:23.57]Oh, shit.
[44:24.07]Nice.
[44:24.39]Okay.
[44:26.66]They defined an anvil.
[44:28.92]Oh, that was a jump pad.
[44:30.24]I went up.
[44:32.26]I didn't know that that's what that was.
[44:34.28]No, what happened to my... I replaced my weapon.
[44:40.17]Dude, the circle's really small.
[44:44.29]The circle's already done!
[44:45.33]Alright, guys.
[44:49.07]We gotta- there's a crab down here.
[44:50.35]We gotta- do we have to fight down here?
[44:53.48]Um... Oh, shit.
[44:54.74]We gotta get up this cliff somehow.
[44:58.40]The circle is small.
[45:03.07]How do I get over there?
[45:05.67]Wait, you're- you're- Why is it so small?
[45:08.70]There's no helping you.
[45:11.12]What the fuck?
[45:11.76]How did I fuck this up?
[45:12.74]Yeah, I don't know where to go.
[45:13.74]Did we have to go in that cave?
[45:15.06]I think we're all dead.
[45:15.90]I think there was a cave down there.
[45:18.65]And I accidentally jumped up and you all followed me.
[45:26.56]What?
[45:27.18]How small is the circle?
[45:28.70]What the fuck is happening?
[45:31.37]Yeah, it's a... Yeah.
[45:33.87]Yeah.
[45:34.81]That's how small the circle is now?
[45:36.41]Are you kidding me?
[45:39.32]Wait, I made it.
[45:43.82]there other players yeah it's me and Jerma like enemies bbp these guys I can't even hurt this guy I'm going up in the am
[46:15.21]The bow guy is not the Elden Ring experience, I can tell you that.
[46:20.42]It's not good?
[46:22.10]I mean, it seems okay.
[46:25.28]It just feels weird.
[46:29.05]Just say it's bad.
[46:30.87]You're scared of the bow community.
[46:33.91]I mean, I don't have to actually engage anything, so it's good, but... So this is day one.
[46:41.08]We didn't do very well.
[46:45.38]Okay, so now what?
[46:48.03]I think this is the boss.
[46:49.13]The bell bearing hunter?
[46:50.57]Oh, this is just a guy.
[46:51.53]Fuck him up.
[47:01.47]That doesn't work on bosses.
[47:03.83]I got this.
[47:08.58]Going up.
[47:11.10]Wait, you should be... Oh, I landed on your pillar!
[47:18.09]The anti-synergy.
[47:21.80]Throw your items!
[47:22.62]Throw your items!
[47:23.42]Oh shit, that's right, you have stuff.
[47:30.33]I feel like such a shitter.
[47:32.76]Oh!
[47:33.53]I got you, I got you.
[47:34.43]Wait, come hit me.
[47:35.03]I got you.
[47:35.39]I got him, I got him.
[47:36.89]He's fighting you.
[47:38.13]You just made me get fucking killed.
[47:40.53]What do you mean I did?
[47:48.90]What?
[47:49.18]Oops.
[47:53.29]What's my, like, my melee move?
[47:56.91]Like, I have this special unarmed move.
[47:59.87]Alright, you got me.
[48:01.83]Should I use this?
[48:06.25]Oh my God.
[48:08.15]You guys are allowed to dodge.
[48:10.67]No, no, no.
[48:12.54]We're not allowed to die.
[48:14.34]No dodge.
[48:18.80]Res.
[48:21.19]Wait, please.
[48:22.41]I got him.
[48:22.71]I got him under control.
[48:29.20]I think we can do this.
[48:30.38]I think we just need to send enough bodies at him.
[48:35.12]Whirlwinding!
[48:35.88]Whirlwinding!
[48:36.24]What'd you do after that?
[48:48.28]Oh.
[48:48.92]Going up!
[49:00.11]One hit!
[49:01.62]Why did I just do a flip?
[49:05.23]He's on me.
[49:07.49]Ow!
[49:08.31]He's coming to you, Poke.
[49:10.85]I'm dead.
[49:12.19]No, no.
[49:12.45]You're good.
[49:12.75]You're good.
[49:13.05]You're good.
[49:15.72]You're good.
[49:16.02]He's right next to you.
[49:17.00]He's right on you.
[49:17.48]He's there.
[49:19.50]Oh, God.
[49:20.94]Oh!
[49:21.73]No!
[49:22.67]No!
[49:24.55]No!
[49:26.41]No!
[49:28.11]This game is hard.
[49:28.97]This is fun, though.
[49:29.83]I like it.
[49:33.95]okay well it recaps that we did nothing wait wait wait guys guys look at the session id zero zeros we were one of the first 50 000. dude get a screenshot view footprints rare rare id oh this shows everything we did that's funny that's cool

[50:38.57]So.
[50:39.07]Okay.
[50:39.85]So we should put those on, right?
[50:44.89]I can't use the chair now.
[50:45.80]It's not here yet.
[50:50.04]Alright, these are permanent.
[50:54.43]Yeah.
[50:55.95]Oh, they're also per character.
[50:57.83]It's kind of like Bloodborne.
[50:59.36]The Bloodborne system.
[51:03.47]yeah I'll use the first guy no I want to use the first guy really yeah okay your first guy I could do no what about I I could do uh yeah executor sounds like he turns into a the beast move sounds cool what is that yeah what about maybe I'll just try wilder that seemed like kind of aren't you a mage person
[51:33.52]Yeah, but I feel like I kind of want to learn the game first before I go mage.
[51:37.99]I'm wildering.
[51:39.55]I think he's my guy.
[51:40.62]I'll stay with the bird.
[51:41.42]This time I'm going to utilize the shield a lot more.
[51:43.00]I thought there was going to be more guys, actually.
[51:51.61]Wait, I don't know if I like parrying at all.
[51:55.78]freaking love it Rick it I'll try it uh I'm writing us up for the same mission so can we use can we do anything like can we get any upgrades at all um at the altar you could equip but it would be for your character you just played and I forget what else we got should I commit we got some other kind of currency I don't know what it's I'll try this guy one time yeah we got Merc that someone can spend
[52:23.10]there's a pot friend in the back oh pot friend sells some stuff in the like library room oh okay but it's like oh he sells random jewels and hellos emotes which I I got fucking I got baited and I bought hello when there's actual progression oh should I bought are you serious oh that was dumb
[52:51.70]every time sir we're good every day with you every day I'm hustling I think that was good I can say whatever cringe should I want because you can't even hear me I'm too low I heard you perfectly damn it uh we're good to go alright this time we kind of we kind of get it now
[53:19.55]Are we going to split up or are we doing a thing together?
[53:21.41]We can go like tag team a boss again.
[53:28.34]Wait, what is a big man?
[53:30.52]I don't know if I'm going to.
[53:31.55]I feel like this is a big mistake and I should commit to the other guy and learn.
[53:35.23]Oh no, I can't cancel.
[53:36.67]Oh crap.
[53:38.30]You're going to do fine.
[53:40.10]I'm freaking out.
[53:43.66]This part's cool.
[53:51.86]so yeah when we're on the birds we can all go somewhere different or do we really even split up well I feel like I'm asking I feel like splitting up is not great we can choose like a good place to land we could go like straight into a cave together so fast compared to splitting yeah let's take a look at the map let's see what the what the map has to say
[54:17.18]We never did find a way to upgrade our weapons either.
[54:19.46]We never found an anvil.
[54:21.38]Alright, I say we go right to the jail.
[54:22.87]Right to the jail.
[54:23.43]Yep.
[54:25.29]We're about to get fucked up.
[54:26.79]We're level one.
[54:28.24]We're level one.
[54:29.38]We're good.
[54:30.20]Can we get level two first?
[54:31.54]No, no.
[54:32.00]Jail right now.
[54:32.52]What's this?
[54:32.82]What's this?
[54:33.09]A tree.
[54:33.31]A tree.
[54:34.09]Oh, never mind.
[54:35.89]Never mind.
[54:36.85]I feel like we all just said this at the same time.
[54:40.92]How do we do this?
[54:43.38]Do we all need to be here?
[54:44.55]Okay, I'm coming.
[54:45.79]Oh, do we need the gargoyle?
[54:49.59]Open.
[54:50.33]We need a stone sword key.
[54:51.36]Thank God.
[54:52.06]Oh, God.
[54:53.02]Let's go in this church.
[54:55.10]Let's raise the sun.
[55:00.05]My character is way faster now.
[55:02.35]Missed.
[55:05.91]Foolish misbegotten.
[55:08.46]Does this game have bleed?
[55:10.96]It does.
[55:23.70]Watch that.
[55:24.80]Ow.
[55:28.28]God damn it.
[55:33.87]I'm owning...
[55:39.27]I like this character so much.
[55:41.02]I actually don't know if I like this character.
[55:43.00]It doesn't have a full dodge.
[55:44.90]It's like a little step.
[55:48.31]I love my animations.
[55:52.87]Argyle.
[55:56.24]Rotten Crystal Sword.
[56:03.47]Holy, he dropped.
[56:04.71]We're already better off.
[56:06.09]We're good.
[56:07.66]min level three also like yeah I I got a meteor sword it looks it sounds like it has a sick passive and you it doesn't matter if you actually use it or not alright let's go before this circle kills us is the same map yeah circles look looks fine where are we going you want to go to this weird fire thing right here okay I mean it's do you do you choose the map before we play
[56:36.67]I only have one option, which is to fight the Triathalos thing.
[56:40.35]But otherwise, it sounds like that would be an Expedition choice.
[56:45.58]But that all might still be on the same map, I don't know.
[56:50.98]Wait, the map changes rarely?
[57:03.88]I have my Beast Ult, I could try soon.
[57:07.85]Any good items?
[57:08.71]Improved the guarding ability on that.
[57:13.14]Use the shield?
[57:14.98]I'm trying.
[57:16.56]Uh, we got a, we got a group.
[57:19.17]Okay.
[57:21.23]I guess no one wants it.
[57:24.70]You said improve guarding?
[57:26.86]Yeah.
[57:27.80]Let me see it.
[57:29.00]I don't.
[57:30.21]There you go.
[57:30.71]Bastard sword.
[57:33.13]Ooh, uh, sure.
[57:35.98]And yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[57:37.08]Those passives work even if you don't use that.
[57:40.03]Oh, that's right.
[57:40.79]Okay.
[57:44.35]So I've been told.
[57:45.07]Can I have a horse?
[57:50.06]That's Vinny.
[58:02.64]Nice.
[58:03.34]We're good.
[58:05.26]I'm having a hard time remembering the skill buttons.
[58:09.62]Yeah, triangle is weird to press first.
[58:14.37]For me.
[58:16.01]Yeah, it's going to take a lot of getting used to, but... I feel like getting used to switching to two-handed to one-handed in Elden Ring was already kind of a thing to do.
[58:24.76]It was already kind of a pain to learn it.
[58:38.40]The sword says race while walking.
[58:40.20]I don't... Where's the circle now?
[58:45.73]Does it actually mean walking?
[58:47.84]What the hell?
[58:49.14]What is that?
[58:49.72]Legendary item or something?
[58:51.18]What is that?
[58:51.78]Yeah, the sword says race while walking.
[58:54.06]If I'm not moving fast, I'm just a missile turret.
[58:57.47]Wait, you're a sword all the time?
[58:59.19]No matter what?
[59:00.33]This is guaranteed win.
[59:01.84]Wait, that's so cool.
[59:02.52]As long as I'm walking.
[59:06.00]Wait, that's actually really cool.
[59:07.38]That's amazing.
[59:09.77]I've got aura.
[59:15.62]Raptor, the mist dagger.
[59:20.30]We need a place to go.
[59:21.91]We're at the edge of the map.
[59:23.05]We need to start going like north.
[59:25.91]No matter what north.
[59:30.96]Let's head up to the grace right here.
[59:35.72]Level up.
[59:41.77]This is actually getting pretty fun.
[59:46.50]Like how fast it is.
[59:48.72]We got a spirit tree.
[59:52.23]Take hold.
[59:52.95]Oh, we can fly from this.
[59:56.42]Guys.
[59:57.48]Wait, where?
[59:58.84]The tree that I'm standing on.
[59:59.88]You can get on the bird and fly.
[60:02.65]And then we can go wherever.
[60:07.01]Let's go to the big castle.
[60:09.66]What the fuck?
[60:11.22]Uh-oh, it's flying me away.
[60:11.98]I can't change.
[60:14.56]Oh.
[60:15.14]It's not... Come.
[60:20.05]It is.
[60:20.37]You can kind of control.
[60:21.31]Oh, the circle's coming in.
[60:22.63]I'm going to the castle.
[60:24.80]I think we're all flying to the same place, right?
[60:27.78]I'm in a house alone.
[60:29.28]Oh, shit.
[60:30.77]Beware of the circle.
[60:33.37]Yeah, Poke, we're far away from you right now.
[60:35.29]Oh, shit.
[60:36.75]I'm just gonna run.
[60:44.37]There's random heals just laying around on the ground, too.
[60:59.31]Oh, that's FP, not HP.
[61:00.57]Alright.
[61:02.63]Uh, I can't get in this front door of the castle.

[63:19.70]That's a huge fucking deal.
[63:20.96]Oh, that's sick.
[63:21.66]That's a massive deal.
[63:24.61]Finding accessories is big too, I think.
[63:27.31]Yeah.

[63:33.82]Come level here.
[63:36.80]Oh, hell yeah.

[63:44.90]Where are you right now?
[63:46.34]I'm like in a sewer under the castle.
[63:48.70]I like it.
[63:49.31]I like the gameplay loop.
[63:50.35]I'm excited for the boss fight.
[63:52.31]I like it.

[63:58.10]You have to wait.
[63:59.48]Wait, what do you mean?

[64:04.66]Oh, actually.
[64:06.79]How about, I don't know, like over here maybe?
[64:13.76]I'm ADHD-ing.

[64:22.49]I don't know.
[64:25.51]Oh, I'm coming with you.
[64:26.95]There's no fall.
[64:28.22]I'm still going to Ster.
[64:30.72]I'm under the castle.
[64:31.72]You might not be able to find me.
[64:34.52]I'm going to go this way.
[64:41.53]I don't think I'm going to be able to beat this.
[64:43.66]Blue zone like PUBG?
[64:44.84]Yes.
[64:45.60]There is a... Wait, did we get a key?
[64:47.86]There's a weird guy over there.
[64:50.45]What's this weird guy?
[64:55.15]Ooh.

[65:03.90]Ooh.
[65:05.93]No.
[65:07.29]Yeah, I want my other... I want a chance to even look at my weapon.
[65:12.70]That's a weird place.
[65:15.25]Um... Poke, you want to hit up this cave here?
[65:20.51]Uh, hey, it's moving.
[65:21.31]Shit's moving.
[65:23.42]Wait, what's this?
[65:23.96]I don't want to get stuck down here.
[65:25.04]I'm nowhere near you guys.
[65:26.12]Oh, we don't have a key still?
[65:28.96]No, let's try to hit into this cave.
[65:36.41]This should be safe, right?
[65:37.77]I think.
[65:39.83]Away from the circle.
[65:45.00]This is like fucking Superman Elden Ring.
[65:57.92]I'm in the cave.
[65:59.10]Yeah, I'm right behind you.
[66:01.62]I haven't used my ult yet.
[66:07.81]Turned into a beast.
[66:08.23]Yeah, let's try to be quick if we can just because I'm terrified that we're gonna get trapped in that thing.
[66:14.92]Wait, big monster here?
[66:15.84]Is this it?
[66:17.18]I'm also seeing that it's good to have a mix of characters because like I found faster spellcasting palettes.
[66:23.83]What the fuck is that?
[66:24.69]Oh my god.
[66:25.31]Okay.
[66:26.13]Oh my god.
[66:26.80]Is that you?
[66:27.96]Yeah.
[66:28.42]Oh, that's you.
[66:29.04]Okay.
[66:33.44]That's your ult?
[66:34.25]That's insane.
[66:35.19]Oh my god.
[66:37.59]You can't hurt me, can you?
[66:39.27]No.
[66:39.59]I hope you can't hurt me.
[66:45.84]I can't pick it up.
[66:46.76]I can't use these smithing stones.
[66:48.70]Oh, I should have looked at the other item.
[66:49.90]You need to find an anvil.
[66:51.46]I think it's done.
[66:52.38]I think we leave now, right?
[66:53.56]I think... Is that it?
[66:55.78]There's nothing here now, yeah.
[66:56.69]Let's head out this way.
[66:59.07]It's going to end at the tree.
[67:00.35]The Erdtree on the map.
[67:01.91]Can we... Maybe there's an exit this way?
[67:05.57]There is, yeah.
[67:06.13]I should have... Oh, shit.
[67:07.42]There's an item on the ground.
[67:08.48]Why did I attack that guy?
[67:09.48]Am I stupid?
[67:11.32]Yeah.

[68:59.66]That was too intense.
[69:11.03]What the hell?
[69:11.89]You can't run when you lock on or something.
[69:14.22]I blocked him.
[69:18.89]Can I get my runes back?
[69:21.09]No.
[69:22.60]I don't know.
[69:23.36]They might be in a bad spot.
[69:28.16]You can?
[69:28.62]Yes.
[69:29.00]Oh, it's right here.
[69:29.98]I'm going for it.
[69:31.02]Any more graces that we can touch?
[69:33.33]Boss is going to spawn.
[69:34.59]Oh, shit.
[69:34.97]I have no health.
[69:35.81]Oh, no.

[70:00.52]Indeed.
[70:00.94]I just used the wrong item.
[70:11.65]He blocked?
[70:15.36]I've got Yoda aggro.
[70:17.34]I'm dead.
[70:24.15]Thank you.
[70:30.46]I'm going up.

[70:44.45]Sensory overload!
[70:45.67]There's a lot going on.

[70:51.92]I am the boss.
[70:54.08]Are there four bosses?
[70:55.58]Oh, you do look like the boss.
[70:57.35]I died.
[71:00.03]You haven't seen that anime.
[71:01.79]He's attacking me.
[71:02.87]I can't... I detonated him.
[71:06.16]What the hell is that?
[71:07.98]Wait, what the hell?
[71:09.14]Dude, I can't do anything.
[71:10.10]I can't do anything.

[71:42.75]I'm coming to help you.
[71:44.35]I'm down.
[71:44.72]I got you.
[71:51.85]Oh my God, it hurts.

[72:12.24]Wait, this is the... It's just this little guy.
[72:14.94]Little guy, yep.
[72:18.86]I'm hitting him with the aura.
[72:23.77]We just did it.
[72:25.73]We did it.
[72:26.27]We just beat the first level.
[72:28.25]Critical hits restore HP.
[72:29.47]Successive attacks... Critical hits restore HP.
[72:35.76]I don't know.
[72:36.72]I think this.
[72:38.28]I think this one too.
[72:41.46]Nice.
[72:42.20]So now what do we do?
[72:42.70]Why is it like a square with an arrow?
[72:44.56]Like a weird... What is that?
[72:48.89]How do I do thank you?
[72:50.01]We can level up here.
[72:56.29]Guys?
[72:56.99]Are we going to live through this?
[73:00.10]I think it's done.
[73:02.52]I don't know.
[73:03.04]Unless it's resetting the world to day two.
[73:06.11]Yeah, because that was not the Triapolis.
[73:09.10]Day 11.
[73:10.70]Holy shit, we just skipped 10 days.
[73:14.55]Okay, there's like corrupted things on the map now.
[73:20.14]Day 11.
[73:21.16]I guess we'll see if the church respawned.
[73:30.68]I got an ad break that's coming up.
[73:33.79]I'm just gonna run it right now.
[73:34.53]I got a second thing that casts while I walk.

[91:05.08]That thing is so cool, Poke, honestly.
[91:11.03]I wonder if he gets better.
[91:13.09]Oh no!
[91:13.89]Oh my god.
[91:16.14]Shit.
[91:19.38]Oh no, I knew that was going to get me.

[91:23.20]I'm just gonna go back to walking.
[91:33.83]Wait, you guys notice it's us versus the three horsemen?
[91:38.44]Oh, it is.
[91:42.46]Gallop!
[91:47.41]There's a heal on the floor somewhere.

[92:12.92]We're alive!
[92:14.48]Oh, thank god.
[92:15.54]We did it.
[92:17.50]Damn.
[92:18.90]Uh-oh, knight three.
[92:20.70]Pause at the yellow flame of frenzy to finally burst forth while walking.
[92:24.55]Why is there so much while walking things?
[92:29.45]It's like... kinda weird.
[92:31.73]Slow you down.
[92:34.34]Oh, it's aura.
[92:37.64]I also summon glint blades now.
[92:39.72]Yeah, I need this.
[92:41.85]Yeah, you're kind of a walking nuke.
[92:45.73]I need a tower shield.
[92:48.53]If anyone sees a tower shield, I need it.
[92:57.86]Oh, I think we have to go into the jellyfish scoop.
[93:03.59]Travel into the spirit shelter.
[93:07.80]I have a great shield.
[93:09.10]I think I could probably drop it for you.
[93:13.79]Yeah, gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
[93:36.55]This thing sucks, by the way.
[93:38.98]My medium shield is better.
[93:41.32]I thought great shields would make me walk.
[93:43.34]It's like actually hard to hold the analog stick at the perfect walk.
[93:47.07]Oh, dude, hold on.
[93:49.47]Automatically heals HP when low.
[93:51.70]Make sure you buy some of this stuff.
[93:53.82]Wait, where?
[93:55.52]Right in front of me?
[93:58.87]Oh, hurt.
[94:00.69]Boiled crab is very OP.
[94:04.01]in regular Dark Souls would recommend well good luck wow that was the worst thing I just bought I just trolled myself nice there's a scary thing through here I'm assuming this is our last thing so I'm just spending everything

[94:42.64]This is cool.
[94:48.06]Oh, we got to go to the door.
[94:51.59]I thought that was a bad thing that just happened straight.
[94:53.71]I'm sorry.
[94:54.35]I can't stop.
[94:58.61]I was trying to like E3 cinema walk to the door and all my bullshit started.

[95:05.01]It's me and Mike.
[95:05.47]That's me, not you guys.
[95:07.25]This is going to be cool, I think.
[95:12.63]Perry.
[95:30.09]Ugh, yeah, when you've like, you got chicken in the back of the fridge, you don't know it's been there.
[95:34.48]Like two months.

[96:43.38]Oh, shit!
[96:45.05]Should I even use the... the heal or let you guys res me?
[96:54.56]You should have all your heals back.
[96:56.81]You should definitely use your heals.
[96:58.47]Dude, getting used to pressing up on the D-pad instead of square is going to take, like, a week.
[97:06.50]Ouch.
[97:29.50]I need someone to take focus.
[97:31.30]I'm trying.
[97:31.56]I have all the stupid, like... I have Redon's bow ability.

[98:27.26]I thought he was... Oh, shit.
[98:32.59]I thought he was gonna do a bigger move.
[98:44.09]That's actually an amazing thing to do with this character.
[98:48.16]Nice, alright, alright, alright.
[98:49.18]Regroup, regroup.
[98:54.27]I'm going up.

[99:48.32]It's not over yet.
[99:56.83]Oh.

[100:27.16]I love the vibes from you.
[100:29.66]Night three is a lot.
[100:31.89]It's a cool game.
[100:33.05]I actually like the game.
[100:37.03]We definitely did stall on day two, but we're new as hell.
[100:40.13]So I get it now.
[100:41.78]Yeah, there's a lot to learn.
[100:43.98]Yeah, it really just kind of throws you.
[100:45.24]I still feel like we're going to learn new stuff for like hours.
[100:49.06]There's so many weird things on the map.
[100:53.21]But yeah, thanks, Poke.
[100:54.07]Sorry you have to go.
[100:54.65]Yeah, thanks, Poke.

[101:03.25]See you later.
[101:06.83]Well, so what do you want to do?
[101:10.73]Were you able to find a backup?
[101:13.80]I did not.
[101:16.24]What do I do?
[101:23.20]I don't know I mean if we queue with two we could I mean I've heard that like I assume the balance does not change at all for two is what it sounded like from the interviews
[101:46.64]I mean we could really you know one guy I mean I could ask I don't know one guy I I asked a couple people brought up to a couple people let's see who's who's who I don't know but I want to put the pressure on somebody they're live right now like oh hey man we're currently in a menu right now um are you coming like that's too much pressure I mean if someone's playing solo I don't know is there anyone playing solo anybody playing solo I'm sure they would love the invite
[102:17.50]Elden Ring category.
[102:21.81]There's your pick of every single streamer on Twitch.
[102:35.14]I mean, if we play a duo, even if we lose, I feel like there's still a ton we can learn.
[102:39.42]There's a lot to learn, yeah.
[102:47.44]Yeah, and don't go pressure anybody that's currently playing that wants to just do their own thing.
[102:51.55]Don't do that.
[103:00.86]You gonna have a random join you for a third?
[103:04.09]They're gonna be better than us.
[103:05.57]That's fine.
[103:08.12]We're gonna look so... We're gonna look so dumb.
[103:14.96]well first of all we can do that I don't I don't let me uh let's take a look at what we just got we got new gear yeah that whole uh the extra loot thing seems cool mine were not I did not get very good ones like I got intelligence ones on that guy which I guess would have scaled my standing still so can you do you just keep these I guess you just hold on to them right
[103:44.66]yeah cool I don't know there's uh the pot friend was selling items as well so you can like buy relics from him yeah let's see what that's all about uh polish to receive its precious gift better oh these the ones he's selling are literally for me buffing pots
[104:15.16]were you able to like crit stab any of the downed bosses I think I saw poke do it once oh I got a good one I'm doing the random acquisition yeah my random one was get more runes for yourself and allies kind of seems like a big deal
[104:46.48]Let me go pee.
[104:47.46]Let me go pee.
[104:49.12]Okay.
[104:49.32]We'll figure it out.
[104:50.71]Alright.
[104:55.14]This will be the first break.
[104:55.84]This will be the first real break.
[104:58.06]Don't drink your own pee.
[104:59.73]Yeah.
[105:01.53]yeah sorry like 40 minutes ago the ads ran I I kind of had to I didn't want to just have it go randomly oh boy this game's really cool I I kind of was like I'm excited night rain yeah like obviously I'm like an Elden Ring game but having played I was playing the convergence mod recently it was alright but this game is like 10 times
[105:23.97]critical's playing solo too yeah it's but if people if people want to do critical said he was down moy said he was down are you I don't want to put pressure on people to do something was Charlie want to play he was down but not tonight yeah yeah yeah that no no no not the night not the night don't pressure people that are just doing their own thing uh let's see I'll be back uh I'll be back
[105:52.07]I'm going to run another ad break to make sure they don't happen during another play session.
[105:55.76]So I'll be back in a few minutes.
[105:57.60]I'm going to go pee and refill my drink.
[105:59.98]I think it's really fun though.
[106:00.75]This is great.
[106:01.61]It's chaotic.
[106:02.25]It's crazy.
[106:02.89]It's my heart has been pounding the whole time.
[106:05.72]So I'll be right back.
[111:50.88]Hello.
[111:57.99]Okay.
[111:58.79]So, Ster here.
[112:06.42]Gonna enjoy the caster.
[112:07.35]I don't know why he's not doing it.
[112:09.77]Caster?
[112:11.15]Oh, hey.
[112:12.99]So... What do you want to do?
[112:18.39]Because Holly said that she would play, but she's got to download it and do the tutorial.
[112:22.43]So she's probably like 45 minutes to an hour away.
[112:26.12]So when you queue up, there is a password you can put in for groups.
[112:33.33]Hold on.
[112:33.63]Let me make sure.
[112:40.29]I think I can set one and we can have like a likely a community person join if they put in their group password.
[112:46.24]Yeah, that's fine.
[112:47.12]That doesn't bother me.
[112:50.57]What's a good password here?
[112:52.79]What's a good key phrase?
[112:55.51]Hmm.
[112:59.48]You're gonna think, like, for an hour.
[113:01.58]I'm gonna do Jupiter.
[113:03.30]Okay.
[113:03.87]But Jupiter, like, with a number.
[113:08.15]It's day one.
[113:09.55]Who else is writing Jupiter as a group password?
[113:11.98]I don't know.
[113:12.56]There's a lot of people.
[113:15.34]It's Jupiter, all lowercase.
[113:16.98]Okay.
[113:19.91]It says that, to be clear, using a password makes it more likely to see bloodstains, phantoms, and so on from others using the same password.
[113:27.44]I don't know if that'll make it more likely that if it like randomly cues us, it's someone from that group as well.
[113:37.50]And then I guess we can cue.
[113:39.10]Are you in?
[113:40.72]Did you get kicked out of my group?
[113:42.53]I might have.
[113:44.41]It doesn't show you on the top, right?
[113:47.86]I send a few messages to people.
[113:50.22]We'll see if anybody is down.
[113:52.24]If not, then Holly could play later or we could get community people.
[113:55.57]It's fine.
[113:57.67]Yeah.
[114:01.42]Let me see.
[114:02.22]I don't think I'm in your game.
[114:04.38]Oh.
[114:05.66]You want to re-invite me to your game?
[114:08.87]Or should I just use the password?
[114:13.91]I might need to get... I don't even know how the password works.
[114:18.55]you like never had to type it in but I also am like scared to show it on stream I'll invite you again I think it's fun though at least the the uh initial period here has been pretty crazy yeah I like how fast paced it is I uh oh I'm in okay uh let me do I'm gonna grab my coffee I'll be right back
[114:51.83]30 seconds 10 9 wait that's 10 seconds
[115:19.90]those are his knees uh we could hear your door squeak I like squeak noises you're you were you were not muted oh well I just drank my uh coffee
[115:49.97]that's all alright so let's take a look I'm gonna be the marksman again but as soon as I find a melee weapon that's going on I'm gonna try the uh the default guy I think I like him is he fun the hook's a little a little weird so the thing is with the relics certain characters have certain colored relics
[116:15.67]and the marksman ones that I have seem really good so I got like plus dexterity ones and one that makes everybody in the party get more runes and then the their like ability is they get more items as well so they just seem like the force multiplier oh shit I got a purple oh what attack power plus maybe the glossosaur fire attack power
[116:45.18]Alright, I need to get a colossal greatsword.
[116:49.85]For what?
[116:50.89]For the Wilder.
[116:52.83]Is the thing that he has technically a colossal greatsword?
[116:59.54]I don't think so.
[117:01.73]I think it may be just a greatsword or a longsword.
[117:04.67]It is a greatsword.
[117:07.20]Alright, what is his special move?
[117:08.36]He's got the claw launch.
[117:10.00]He's got the onslaught.
[117:12.49]Yeah.
[117:13.35]And you can come back to life.
[117:15.27]That's cool.
[117:15.91]It makes like a white flash is what it is.
[117:17.99]I didn't know what it was a couple times.
[117:20.41]I thought I timed my dodge so well I got a perfect dodge, but it was me dying.
[117:25.66]Oh.
[117:29.66]There's a lot of cool lore here probably.
[117:35.09]Alright, I'm pretty much ready if you want to just try one.
[117:39.69]Yeah, I'm going to do it.
[117:40.84]I'm going to
[117:47.40]um yeah okay so this is matchmaking for the third and I have group password set to Jupiter okay let's see what happens we get somebody the golden ticket winner who's it gonna be why are your eyes so crazy today
[118:18.06]oh a bit of a sorcerer eh I was saying what was weird to me is like if you want to be the healer you can't start with the holy seal but there's a whole bunch of relics for holy stuff why am I alone
[118:48.32]I don't know failed to enter multiplayer session oh that was pretty dramatic for it to not work yeah they saw it was our group and said nope well okay try it again I think um wall jump if you've been forgetting there's a wall jump
[119:18.20]I'll let you do a lot of silly stuff.
[119:20.77]You're talking about the tap tap jump?
[119:26.23]Yeah, the tap tap jump, I guess, would be a more intelligent way to put it.
[119:30.10]I think you need to ready up.
[119:32.12]I already did.
[119:35.31]Oh, okay.
[119:35.67]That's matchmaking.
[119:43.97]don't use group password I don't know I'm already being yelled at how do you guys know?

[120:26.88]Dude, cast a spell or something.
[120:44.49]Alright, where are we going first?
[120:45.37]Remember, we gotta hit up a church first.
[120:48.45]We need those charges.
[120:51.70]What's at the church?
[120:52.36]I don't think I ever did it with you and Poke.
[120:54.34]Uh, that's where you get another flask charge.
[120:58.52]Oh!
[120:59.43]I think when you get it, you get it for everybody then.
[121:02.51]Um, there's no church.
[121:03.45]Well, we go all the way to the bottom.
[121:05.45]I'm going all the way to this top left big church.
[121:07.88]I don't know.
[121:08.84]Top left big church?
[121:10.66]Oh, I'm sorry.
[121:11.62]Top left is not a good... That is not helpful in any way.
[121:19.67]Oh, I see you doing this one here.
[121:24.96]Did they cast a spell and kill like five enemies?
[121:27.94]It sounded like it.
[121:30.85]Alright, I want a Colossal Greatsword.
[121:36.36]Whoa.
[121:37.26]Whoa.
[121:38.82]Oh, I don't want that.
[121:39.62]That sucks.
[121:41.93]What is this?
[121:46.13]What is this?
[121:47.33]Is it a whip?
[121:49.09]It's like another dead player.
[121:50.91]Maybe because we had the group thing set up?
[121:53.16]I don't know.
[121:53.52]I think me and Poke saw somebody do this before.
[121:55.66]Alright, are we going in here?
[122:03.75]This church?
[122:06.03]Yeah.
[122:10.90]Oh, we're going to need a Grave.
[122:12.67]Oh, there's a Graves over here.
[122:13.49]I'm going to get that real quick.

[125:27.95]A shitty one.
[125:30.91]Yeah, I feel like knowing where these shitty bosses are has actually been very helpful.
[125:35.39]What is this like a open well that we're next to?
[125:39.72]Like the blue.
[125:42.12]I don't know.
[125:43.06]Oh, that's a jump, I think.
[125:45.76]This is a colossal greatsword.
[125:47.44]Hell yeah.
[125:55.93]You got a big dog behind you.
[125:58.02]The biggest dog?
[125:59.30]The biggest dog in Elden Ring.

[126:41.71]Abductor Virgin.
[126:46.74]Relatable.
[126:52.26]Wow, I did a lot of damage with that.
[126:56.73]Yeah, we're getting these really easy bosses here.
[126:59.51]This is great.
[127:03.83]I think this is what the game's supposed to feel like.
[127:07.30]Any loot?
[127:09.78]How's the... I got a good shield if you want it.
[127:15.02]Is that better than what I have?
[127:17.22]No, I don't need a shield.

[127:26.35]Claymore, my beloved.
[127:27.45]I mean, yeah.

[130:59.29]Yes, they're all on the map.
[131:00.98]There's one up.
[131:01.42]I'm going to go to one up here.
[131:07.51]Is that up or... How do we get up there?
[131:12.89]Oh, there's one of those jumpers.
[131:23.99]Dude, I'm already level six.
[131:25.05]It took us...
[131:27.05]Alright.
[131:27.95]Did we figure out how to play?
[131:31.22]I think we got a wizard.
[131:35.28]Alright.
[131:35.52]From here... This camp over here?
[131:40.79]I guess.
[131:47.60]Levels make a huge difference.
[131:48.60]I think we also need to start figuring out where to get smithing stones and stuff.
[131:53.51]Mm-hmm.
[131:58.36]rains gather what is that yeah I think that's the circle coming in oh so he's probably we gotta head I'm gonna head that way so this is we gotta get over there now then because this is closing on us right now I'm just heading over there well are you what level are you uh six yeah me too okay
[132:30.37]Uh, there's a ruins over here.
[132:31.61]Let's see if we can get whatever's in here.
[132:36.31]I might get caught out for what I'm doing.
[132:38.08]Defeating enemy restores... life.
[132:48.03]Item discovery... I feel like item discovery would be kind of bad.
[132:56.71]Poison... eh.
[133:03.09]I just don't know what's a priority.
[133:04.55]Like what?
[133:05.19]Oh shit.
[133:07.63]Where are they?
[133:17.65]You're my priority.
[133:19.79]Burial watchdogs?
[133:21.59]Oh shit.
[133:22.57]Oh, it's these things.
[133:24.30]These things are horrible.
[133:30.29]I don't think I can do this.
[133:39.88]Oh!
[133:42.84]Nice.
[133:46.99]We're killing this watchdog here.
[133:51.33]Very nice.
[133:51.90]Very nice.
[133:52.28]I'm coming.
[133:52.74]I'm not far off.
[133:55.55]Oh, I have a restore life when monsters are defeated and it's like I'm nowhere near you and I'm getting life.
[134:02.06]For what you guys are killing.
[134:04.82]We got a lot of there's a lot of random.
[134:07.00]Oh, there's a ton of shit down here.
[134:08.67]Big chests.
[134:19.98]I think the things closing too, so we should probably.
[134:22.94]oh wrong way wrong way oh there's the the golden light in the sky is where it is good to know alright well what are we doing it's here
[134:51.31]The zone doesn't insta-kill, but it's pretty bad.
[135:13.89]Ouch.
[135:17.08]Ranger feels good in these areas where there's a lot of like little annoying things.
[135:22.00]Yeah.
[135:25.53]Is the bow actually fun to use?
[135:28.84]Oh, it's a lot better than normal Elden Ring.
[135:31.74]I'd still say like melee is funner.
[135:38.97]But you don't have to like worry about arrows and you can kind of just spam it.
[135:45.88]Alright, let's see if we can do day one.
[135:51.31]Devil human!
[135:52.33]Holy shit!
[136:05.20]Wood!
[136:05.38]I'm fighting the little guy over here alone.
[136:12.49]Seem to be doing okay.
[136:17.91]I was getting like headshots on the boss, too
[136:49.03]Ouch!
[137:01.87]Oh!
[137:08.86]Uh-oh!
[137:09.08]He got me with his super move.
[137:12.16]His Subaru?
[137:13.38]He hit me with his Subaru, dude.
[137:17.71]Alright, he's dead.
[137:20.20]This guy's almost dead.
[137:34.96]I just keep pressing the wrong button from my one ability every time.
[137:42.93]I need more stamina.
[137:49.15]Alright, that went pretty well.
[137:51.24]Not bad.
[137:51.54]Pretty good.
[138:01.13]I don't know which one is dragon communion.
[138:03.31]I have summons.
[138:04.49]Summons a group of those lost in death.
[138:10.78]Guard counters.
[138:11.76]Oh, guard counters summon things.
[138:13.71]What?
[138:15.15]Cool.
[138:17.29]None of these are useful.
[138:18.94]Okay, I am already the same level as we were when we fought the last boss.
[138:26.63]Yeah.
[138:26.75]So that's interesting.
[138:28.39]I think we got to fight like a lot of mini bosses.
[138:31.26]Like we just happened upon a lot of really easy things to kill where before I was running into like giga bosses way too early.
[138:41.61]Yeah, I feel like we ran into a lot of random shit.
[138:45.06]Like big scary things.
[138:49.13]Yeah, I think I know we're more.
[138:52.51]More used to the hustle as well.
[138:53.93]I think this person also is going to some good spots.
[139:01.58]I want a better hand a ballista.
[139:05.08]That's kind of fun.
[139:08.03]That's funky.
[139:15.70]I kind of want this.
[139:17.80]That's funky.
[139:27.01]hand ballista this thing is bigger than my body I don't know what this red thing is would you call this a hand ballista I mean it's probably pretty good how much does it do a little damage versus HP I'll see how much damage it does versus hit points alright let's go to this uh let's go to this encampment
[139:54.91]Holy crap.
[139:58.01]Takes forever to shoot.
[139:59.17]We are killing stuff.
[140:02.74]Are you addicted?
[140:04.44]Dude, yeah.
[140:20.66]How'd you get up there?
[140:28.05]I don't know, this mage is going to think we're... Uh oh.
[140:31.55]Yeah, I don't know.
[140:32.05]Oh, there we go.
[140:32.51]Right in the middle there.
[140:44.49]Probably shouldn't have done that here, but whatever.
[140:48.24]Am I going to get hit by every single move or what?
[140:55.94]okay this thing takes an hour to reload I'm not into it I'm dead how did that fucking miss you gotta be kidding me I'll get you oh she went down before me somebody behind me
[141:26.13]I blame it all on the hand crossbow and by hand crossbow I mean trebuchet oh my god fucking die oh boiled prawn
[141:55.65]I don't know what this is, plus one to my character's grief.
[142:00.03]But it sounds like it's made for me, so I don't want to not use it.
[142:02.68]It's hidden stat.
[142:07.74]I thought that was a gun.
[142:11.39]Balloon crossbow.
[142:15.38]Shit, I don't have any... Do you have any stones?
[142:20.24]I do.
[142:26.54]use them ah we should go to there's a cookie bug right there I guess I want to go see it oh my weapons need sombers for some reason yeah +2 to being sad right now it's going pretty well
[142:54.88]That'd be sad.
[143:10.11]Max HP.
[143:11.24]Yep.
[143:19.20]I do think holding six weapons is a little goofy.
[143:22.81]That guy had a treasure chest.
[143:23.53]What the hell is that?
[143:28.98]What'd you say?
[143:29.42]What the hell, what?
[143:31.76]Uh, he teleported on me and I killed him.
[143:35.65]He dropped... Not much.
[143:49.25]Alright.
[143:50.49]Fire Axe?
[143:55.97]Holy... Spellcast...
[143:59.74]Oh, poison spear.
[144:00.61]I need it.
[144:01.23]This spellcasting speed thing here.
[144:02.65]I don't know.
[144:03.07]Maybe this guy can use it.
[144:04.81]How do I say, like, look?
[144:07.43]I don't know.
[144:14.02]Looks like you're controlling the game telepathically.
[144:22.55]Where are we going?
[144:24.32]Let's go.
[144:25.02]This is a scary red thing in the middle here.
[144:28.00]Should we do it?
[144:31.89]scary red thing uh sure might as well see what it is wait you have a mana it was for casting it was for casting speed oh okay I need something that regenerates mana or to get like starlight shards anything in here uh there's stuff upstairs
[145:03.48]Yeah.
[145:10.59]It's alright.
[145:14.96]I need a grace.
[145:15.78]Did you seriously just meh that loot?
[145:18.40]Kinda, yeah.
[145:18.96]Wait.
[145:19.26]Oh, he went... Ooh.
[145:20.64]Charge attacks?
[145:21.55]Oh, there's a giant gargoyle bird down there.
[145:25.01]Are we killing it?
[145:27.23]I think we're killing it.
[145:36.39]Damn it!
[145:44.28]Oh, he one-hit me.
[145:45.64]Really?
[145:47.02]Yeah.
[145:48.51]Oh, that's not good.
[145:58.32]He almost one-hit me too.
[146:02.45]Oh, that's bad.
[146:06.16]One hit me again.
[146:07.40]This may be a bad idea.
[146:10.10]Evacuate.
[146:10.82]Oh, they're dead.
[146:12.86]If you can res me and then evacuate.
[146:19.73]Oh, that's not going to happen.
[146:22.58]Damn it.
[146:23.66]I had 41,000 souls on me, so I think I need to go back.
[146:28.57]I do too.
[146:29.23]I don't know.
[146:29.87]Am I allowed to get them if we all died?
[146:32.75]Oh, the mage is still alive.
[146:35.50]because they respawn I think we get in there and get out hey dude you look old yeah I'm 40. shove it up your ass guys if you keep saying this he's gonna retire again alright where are my souls I don't know I'm getting him and I'm getting the out
[147:02.92]Where are they?
[147:03.40]He's following me.
[147:04.74]Where are my souls?
[147:05.79]Oh my god, I have 75,000 souls.
[147:09.01]We gotta get out.
[147:11.51]Yeah, wait.
[147:11.85]What the fuck just died?
[147:12.81]I don't know.
[147:14.00]I just got like 30,000.
[147:16.12]I don't know what our friend did, but there's a cookie bug right here.
[147:23.21]What'd he drop?
[147:25.85]Companion jar?
[147:28.51]Throwing pots?
[147:29.15]Do you need that?
[147:31.21]uh not necessarily let's go I think I'm gonna split up and I'll meet you guys in the end okay we'll check this castle I don't know
[147:59.35]What we got in the castle.
[148:01.22]Very scary.
[148:02.20]It's one of those crucible knights.
[148:21.67]Oh my god!
[148:22.55]I hurt myself with that.
[148:26.18]I think the, the rolly boys always drop howls is what they're doing.
[148:36.45]We're killing it.
[148:40.60]How are you blocking?
[148:41.10]I'm hitting you from the back.
[148:43.90]What is this on the map?
[148:44.82]There's a farm right here.
[148:46.58]Okay, damn that was, that was rough.
[148:49.98]Did we get anything good for that?
[148:51.55]That was, that was crazy.
[148:52.55]That guy was a Crucible Knight.
[148:53.65]They're fucking impossibly hard.
[148:58.84]I'm also getting your souls when I'm on the other side of the map so I think we just there's like an infinite share range which is why you would want to not be grouped reduced uh fp cost on spells is right here if you need it uh no I need recover fp I'm not using spells ranged weapon attacks
[149:19.32]increased yeah that I got that right here yeah I'm nowhere near you uh I will mark it on the map it's literally right there if you want it I can pick it up and I will I'll give it to you I'm heading that way but I don't know if I'll get it I think we gotta go circle's coming do I have enough to level up no only 43 000 shit
[149:47.02]We also didn't get any new charges, which is not great.
[149:52.00]I'm not excited about that.
[150:05.06]Smithing stones work weird in this.
[150:06.46]I don't understand.
[150:13.05]Let's see if I can get enough to level up one more time.
[150:15.52]Did you pick that thing up or do I need to go get it?
[150:17.36]I got it on me.
[150:23.55]Oh, fuck off.
[150:24.21]Yeah, I should buy perfumes.
[150:25.77]You're right.
[150:28.36]We have time.
[150:33.02]Barely.
[150:36.89]Oh god, another Crucible Knight?
[150:38.09]That's not good.
[150:48.71]I gotta fucking shit up.
[150:57.60]Uh, we need to go.
[150:58.36]Now.
[150:59.45]We need to go now.
[151:02.59]My pin.
[151:04.41]Where is this going?
[151:11.96]What did he drop?
[151:16.77]He dropped something.
[151:19.69]Are you kidding me?
[151:21.27]There's a lot of souls.
[151:24.46]We gotta get the fuck out of here.
[151:25.48]We gotta get the fuck out of here!
[151:26.34]We gotta get the fuck out of here!
[151:29.61]That's what I'm saying.
[151:30.53]You should be good.
[151:32.05]I'm good.
[151:32.89]Where's the grace?
[151:39.00]Nice, alright.
[151:40.02]Perfect.
[151:43.16]Oh, this aim is way better.
[151:47.53]Alright, let's destroy whatever it is.
[151:50.14]Give me whatever you said.
[151:52.06]Yep, I got this.
[151:56.32]Range weapon attacks, right?
[152:01.53]Alright, we got two fuckfaces here.
[152:13.61]It's a double fuckface.
[152:17.27]Holy shit.

[153:29.84]What does that do?
[153:33.96]Uh, I don't know.
[153:34.60]I think that's what lets them recover mana.
[153:37.33]Oh god, I'm in mana animation!
[153:58.18]Big blast!
[154:00.45]Blaster!
[154:04.83]That dagger dash sometimes jumps you in a weird way.
[154:08.46]Okay, why does our mage have like a death symbol?
[154:10.52]Oh, they're dead.
[154:11.40]That might be why.
[154:12.86]I got marking them.
[154:16.33]You can res people with ranged attacks.
[154:17.77]It's pretty crazy.
[154:18.55]That's amazing.
[154:19.75]He does not want to leave you alone, by the way.
[154:31.46]go on do it he doesn't do it you can't make him I've got the res that's so convenient yeah marksman's really good I see the I see the light

[155:32.15]Oh, pretty good.
[155:35.31]Not bad.
[155:35.63]Pretty good.
[155:36.81]Oh, man.
[155:37.37]I don't know what to do.
[155:41.94]I feel like we're about to fight the boss, right?
[155:43.86]Maybe the fire and lightning negation?
[155:47.61]Stamina?
[155:49.69]These are all great.
[155:59.55]Take the stamina.
[156:05.92]Dude, this is getting crazy.
[156:07.73]Bro, what the fuck?
[156:08.47]What?
[156:08.75]I wanted the stamina.
[156:10.82]Bro, what the fuck?
[156:28.67]I see it shows, like, what your level up... Is there a, um... Adds on your weapons.
[156:34.54]There is an anvil here.
[156:36.86]Yeah.
[156:36.98]Oh, shit.
[156:37.62]Okay, I'm buying a... I have a Smithing Stone if you need it.
[156:41.35]I think I can buy one.
[156:43.45]I can just give you one.
[156:45.73]Does it have to be... Wait, it has to be a certain one.
[156:50.80]I need the... Yeah, I'm confused with how smithing stones work.
[156:55.40]Shit.
[156:57.44]Does that work?
[156:59.30]no I need I need a better one yeah unfortunately don't we all man I haven't even seen the somber smithing well it is what it is we only have five four flasks do you have do you have two talismans I do what are they
[157:26.29]Charge attack improve and lightning damage negation.
[157:32.23]OK.
[157:33.23]Do you want to eat in one of those?
[157:35.01]No, I just wanted to see if you could use mine.
[157:38.14]Which was fire damage negation.
[157:42.16]I mean, you're the tank you're going to need that here.
[157:46.23]Well, let's go for it.
[157:46.85]Let's let's let's let's go die in 10 seconds.
[157:53.51]I think we're.
[157:55.86]OK.
[158:04.02]I'm feeling pretty cute.
[158:06.48]Skip.
[158:10.51]Oh wait, what if this is the first time this person's gotten here?
[158:15.11]Then they're better than us.
[158:15.94]Alright, we gotta lock in.
[158:25.65]Oh, and the chicken's in the back of the fridge for two months.
[158:29.18]Oh, that's right, dude.
[158:31.42]But what if this time, what if it's covered in, like, blue cheese?
[158:34.17]Something to make it even grosser.
[158:35.86]Oh, dude.
[158:53.63]Alright, I gotta just fix the hair.
[158:54.91]I don't care what it looks like.
[158:55.91]It looks like a fucking rat's nest.
[158:58.64]I get it.
[159:00.16]You're cute.
[159:03.01]Now focus!
[159:04.21]I am gonna focus.
[159:04.87]Eat all your shit.
[159:11.60]Go with me!
[159:14.04]I got hit by it too.
[159:20.58]Yikes.
[159:27.67]That does do a lot of damage if it hits him.
[159:40.44]Oh, come on.
[159:41.05]Get over here.
[159:47.73]Oh, whoops.
[159:48.33]I accidentally S'd this twice.
[159:50.94]wait does everybody get the perfume I don't know yeah there's perfume over here if I don't know if you get in it in this buff it seems like everybody gets it
[160:22.07]Fuck me.
[160:39.70]Ooh, nice hit.
[160:51.25]Poison attack!
[160:56.58]No, no, no, no, no.
[160:58.44]Not good.
[160:58.98]I'll try to get her.
[161:09.17]I'm so slow.
[161:12.84]Alright, here comes the three.
[161:22.43]Oh my God!
[161:25.06]What the fuck, dude?
[161:32.07]I'm stuck on the arena edge.
[161:33.95]I might go down.
[161:41.40]Are you down?
[161:42.12]No, I'm good.
[161:45.25]Another one's coming for you.
[161:49.59]all three of them are over here oh please don't kill me please are they combining again yep I'll get the uh I'll try to get her wow that was like instant I have no more healing oh I'm out of come on
[162:33.71]What the fuck?
[162:34.25]That was hard to avoid.
[162:41.64]I'm trying to... She's laughing at us.
[162:47.79]Oh, no.
[162:48.91]Damn.
[162:51.07]Dude, that... I think that's a lot of health.
[162:52.57]That whip thing was just like... It went through, glitched through the sand.
[162:56.63]That was fucking hard.
[163:05.61]We got a lot of stuff.
[163:14.10]Very cool.
[163:24.41]I do like this character a lot though.
[163:31.04]He's a real cutie.
[163:36.37]if you didn't see you can also sell your relics at the final page oh that's good to know but yeah because you all gain the same souls I think that splitting up needs to happen a little bit I think I think you're right
[164:05.46]How do I use this?
[164:06.32]Somebody said that unlocks a new character.
[164:14.82]How can I?
[164:17.28]Is that show that pocket watch to the lady, but that's the time gives you a new character.
[164:22.33]Could I try it back?
[164:28.96]Well, that kind of answers my question is I think you're probably going to get like healers later.
[164:32.78]I thought there were more characters in this.
[164:35.97]Isn't there like a Bloodborne character in one of the trailers?
[164:38.90]I think there's eight total characters, I think.
[164:40.96]Eight.
[164:43.38]So there's at least three people to unlock.
[164:45.02]Or four.
[164:48.41]I've had quite enough of all the ceremonies.
[164:51.33]Is it her?
[164:51.77]Oh.
[164:56.77]At the pot guy, there's a mirror you buy for another character?
[164:59.32]Now I'm ready to get my hands dirty.
[165:03.31]Did she just do the Smash Brothers brawl?
[165:07.00]Yes.
[165:07.52]And it was me.
[165:09.54]Kirby joins the fight.
[165:13.76]What if Kirby was in this game?
[165:17.73]My heart is fucking... I gotta calm down.
[165:26.68]Okay, I gotta calm down.
[165:27.84]My heart is fucking pounding.
[165:28.87]I don't know if you guys could hear that.
[165:30.29]This is a cool character.
[165:31.13]I can't wait to use her.
[165:32.34]the duchess alright what's the dodge rap I'm playing her I'm no I'm playing her no I just want to see no she's mine magnificent she does a finale fine
[166:04.82]you can play her if you want no no I I like her into the where is the training room this is the new blacksmith where every time I'm gonna walk to the wrong spot I don't know I gotta pee alright guys everybody pee right now go pee everybody pee I'll be back in a few minutes
[166:33.90]Uh, not yet.
[166:34.68]I'll spend it right when I get back.
[166:36.79]Okay, well tell me.
[166:38.82]BRB.
[171:15.02]hello hello how we doing uh pretty good this character's ability is you like target an enemy and it takes a percentage of the damage that that enemy has taken recently
[171:33.21]so you can like stack up and then do it like yeah like if everyone does their ultimate I think you can just like time snap him and he takes it seemed like a 50-ish lower than like I don't know a decent percent I'd have to math and they got a double dash they're pretty cool I'm ready arcane +2 I'm just buying random ones is that stupid
[171:58.39]uh that's what no wait I was gonna tell you by the mirror gives you a new character oh which seems like the faith one because it's a faith mirror I spent all my money and I couldn't do it that's okay do you have the money I just spent it when you told me not to in the same sentence that you were talking ah they don't listen it's okay
[172:26.65]I think it's this guy he's in the same room the like the iron millennial so I have to get three colossal swords equipped for me to get improved attack power that seems kind of insane where where does it tell you that uh I have a purple red gem oh oh you're cheating
[173:00.20]you know so that that old pocket watch you can't even equip it on the touches oh really it's probably just a hand-in item then no some characters could it's uh like one of the colors I think it counts as a green and she can't use it that's freaking crazy
[173:36.33]another mage I'm noticing a trend mage must be pretty good queuing online into parties of three mages I bet you it's not bad I think in these groups where you have like multiple people aggroing one boss standing back as a ranged person it feels so uncomfortable because you like can't control who the boss is attacking
[174:02.40]I don't know.
[174:03.08]I felt safer attacking the boss in close range.
[174:11.13]I want to try a ranged character eventually.
[174:13.23]Melee's just too fun.
[174:18.76]Oh, day one.
[174:19.66]Where we dropping?
[174:24.71]Um... How about...
[174:27.93]right well we have a um yeah we have that grace let's kill quick and then level kill quick let's do this little camp holy attack power now
[175:05.46]yeah yeah okay um grace and then we can go through this like tower do we already have enough to level yeah the first level is like nothing oh oh your ideas how do you like the new character um pretty cool can we even do anything here I guess not
[175:34.45]tree uh there's this place right up there you want to use the jump maybe oh these have bleed on them
[176:00.41]Oh yeah, I'm probably gonna have to share a lot of magic stuff with them, so I guess I'm gonna not take any of it.
[176:13.62]Grow a pencil-thin mustache?
[176:15.76]No.
[176:18.73]Not even once?
[176:19.71]No.
[176:20.89]Not even just to try?
[176:22.01]No, absolutely not.
[176:32.87]Okay, I'm going up into this fort.
[176:38.42]Me and the Major doing something.
[176:47.07]Oh, that's a boss.
[176:56.96]Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[177:01.98]Not usually a big guy here.
[177:06.15]Do you see how many souls we have already, though?
[177:07.89]We do have a lot.
[177:09.98]I think that's, again, because we're... doing, like, twice as many things.
[177:14.08]So, did you just get 3,600 souls?
[177:19.77]Uh... I didn't look or count.
[177:22.55]Because I'm fighting the, like, royal guard.
[177:26.24]I got a stone sword.
[177:27.56]We can do one of the evergales.
[177:29.14]Nice.
[177:34.10]They're like a giant hole here.
[177:44.97]I'm scared.
[177:49.99]I'm scared to do this alone.
[177:52.37]If you want to come to me, there's a bunch of shit over here.
[177:57.98]Cool bow.
[177:59.56]I'm getting a lot of good items from you though.
[178:06.19]lightning grease another bow I hear you you're behind me aren't you yep
[178:36.04]Uh-oh.
[178:37.49]That was dumb.
[178:42.08]What?
[178:43.73]Just getting killed.
[178:44.81]Not a big deal.
[179:05.12]Oh, that was quicker than I thought.
[179:11.11]Oh, I think purple.
[179:12.53]I think I get it.
[179:18.20]Don't let the default enemy kill you, dude.
[179:29.93]Come on.
[179:30.11]I don't even care.
[179:30.69]Just kill them both.
[179:35.48]Uh, can we go here?
[179:45.09]Trying to kill this Royal Army Knights.
[179:51.10]I'm working on it.
[179:58.73]I guess you miss out on uh when you kill them the like special thing drops that I won't be able to get because I'm not there I have not killed them yet I'm still working on it I'm just saying in general that that's the downside of a little split up yeah yeah I can't do that
[180:34.59]I might have to get out of here.
[180:38.82]I hate fighting the spear guys.
[180:39.90]It's like my fucking Achilles heel.
[180:43.74]I'm just going to pick up shit.
[180:50.67]I'm out of here.
[180:51.39]Fuck this thing.
[180:53.19]Goodbye.
[180:56.05]That's a coward talk.
[180:57.73]Oh, hey, friends.
[181:00.74]This thing is coming in.
[181:01.72]I don't know if we can do it.
[181:06.89]Oh, you guys are nowhere over here.
[181:08.39]I was hoping to do an average.
[181:12.12]Uh, we can still do it.
[181:18.33]Holy what?
[181:24.06]What happened?
[181:26.40]I don't want this mage to die.
[181:29.31]But we gotta go.
[181:31.21]We don't have enough.
[181:36.15]Uh, we're coming to you.
[181:47.33]So Everjail.
[181:49.79]Do we have time?
[181:52.53]Um, it might just put us in a different.
[181:55.46]It might just like actually put us in an instance.
[181:59.78]I could try it.
[182:01.48]Yeah, I feel like it might be a throw, but we'll find out.
[182:05.80]I am level two, though.
[182:08.29]You want to say fuck it?
[182:11.69]Hello?
[182:12.09]From what just happened to me?
[182:15.27]Somebody just threw a fucking explosive at me.
[182:23.32]Oh yeah, from the roof they're throwing giant like magic pots.
[182:32.87]I could use a level as well.
[182:38.66]I don't know if we have time for that ever, Jail.
[182:41.78]Is there another one deeper in?
[182:42.71]No, like the circle's almost done.
[182:51.38]I guess like day two we can try one, but that might be harder.
[182:54.67]I don't think you lose it, right?
[182:56.31]You don't necessarily lose it.
[182:58.27]You can hold on to it, right?
[182:59.67]well let's try then there's one here okay and our other player is already kind of going that way but it's really close to the edge and I don't think we get a timer of like when it's gonna come in if it's a throw it's a throw
[183:28.02]but if it's not a throw then it'd be great extra items the beastly brigade oh this is not so bad
[183:55.39]dude thank god I was in the middle of an attack I see I see I can get a bleed brock and then do the timer on him I get it I'm here for that
[184:36.68]Nice.
[184:42.61]Alright, so what's the reward?
[184:43.61]10,000 runes.
[184:51.89]I think I'm doing... It seems like there's not a lot, is it?
[184:56.76]Not really, but my other option wasn't that big.
[185:00.28]I think the resistance is.
[185:01.18]Why not?
[185:11.71]Alright, where to?
[185:13.96]I don't know.
[185:15.40]You want to head up to this, uh, grace, maybe?
[185:18.72]Or I guess, like, oh, it's closing.
[185:20.08]Uh, it's coming in.
[185:22.17]Uh, we got to go to the tree then, right?
[185:27.63]Kind of.
[185:29.51]I think we still get one more... I don't know.
[185:36.38]Is there another, another wave?
[185:39.91]Oh no, this should be the last one.
[185:41.97]So whatever you have time to do.
[185:51.39]Okay.
[185:51.63]Oh, there's a boss like in here.
[185:56.11]Do I get time to do it?
[186:02.90]Oh, it's the deer thing.
[186:08.49]I'm right here if you want to try it.
[186:10.29]This boss is not hard.
[186:14.29]What is he?
[186:15.31]I say as I walk into the puddle.
[186:27.77]It's got a lot of health.
[186:31.00]Yeah, I keep missing it with these claws.
[186:38.91]I haven't looked at it yet.
[186:42.38]I think it has too much health.
[186:44.08]Ooh, that hurt.
[186:46.51]Should we just bail?
[186:47.97]Yeah.
[186:51.17]I don't think we have the time.
[186:52.93]Probably not.
[186:54.42]I don't feel like this one... I don't know.
[186:57.58]I don't feel like I got a lot.
[187:00.44]I do need a grace.
[187:01.96]I don't think we have one.
[187:03.42]The closest one is over there.
[187:04.49]I don't think it's time to get it.
[187:06.01]I'll try.
[187:07.37]Holy fucking smokes.
[187:09.03]Yeah, it came here.
[187:12.93]Get away from me.
[187:14.91]I need to level up one more time.
[187:15.97]Okay, respawn.
[187:22.50]Come on, where is it?
[187:23.94]Where is this fucking thing?
[187:25.44]Oh, I'm in the wrong spot.
[187:26.36]I'm an idiot.
[187:28.12]I don't think I can get there.
[187:30.43]No, no way.
[187:32.51]Whatever.
[187:34.39]Where are you going?
[187:35.25]Uh, I freaked out.
[187:38.21]I lost my train of thought when I got attacked by the moose.
[187:41.48]The moose.
[187:46.42]I hope we don't aggro the moose.
[187:48.59]Oh, he teleported back.
[187:53.02]Should be fine.
[187:59.13]I believe it's fucking big one then, eh?
[188:04.16]Oh, I have no mana.
[188:05.76]That's a knight.
[188:15.65]Monsters.
[188:23.94]Oh, that is right up my ass.
[188:38.42]Oh wow, you stay invisible after your attack.
[188:42.09]Oh, is that what was going on?
[188:43.59]Yeah, that's my ultimate.
[188:52.03]Damn, this character's pretty strong then.
[188:59.01]Okay, good luck.
[189:02.26]Oh no, not the Demi, my queen!
[189:18.64]Uh-oh.
[189:19.87]Bingo.
[189:21.53]Did we just both do it together?
[189:22.59]Yeah.
[189:24.17]Oh, damn.
[189:24.55]I don't know if we both counted.
[189:27.66]Oh, whatever.
[189:28.14]I got the res.
[189:28.94]Yeah.
[189:31.52]Oh, fuck.
[189:32.59]Too many.
[189:33.31]Too many.
[189:34.23]Too many.
[189:40.16]Careful.
[189:45.37]Oh, I don't want to target this little shit.
[190:03.75]Oh, I cannot revive.
[190:08.54]I got him.
[190:12.81]Oh, fuck.
[190:21.24]Freaking Yoda.
[190:22.28]We're going invisible, buds.
[190:25.71]Once they're both not attacking me.
[190:29.49]Oh my fucking god, he's right up my ass!
[190:38.47]I'm going after Yoda.
[190:41.52]You get free backstabs on Yoda when we're invisible.
[190:44.74]Why did I not?
[190:45.32]That's weird.
[190:57.43]I'm going down in a second here.
[191:04.20]Ah, I thought I was gonna get him.
[191:14.71]Dude, tag team Yoda is the strat.
[191:24.13]Good.
[191:28.88]Just like when Darth Maul and Darth Vader teamed up.
[191:31.72]I died.
[191:33.17]Nice.
[191:37.66]Okay, that was alright.
[191:38.36]That was fine.
[191:40.98]Could have been worse.
[191:50.83]Is that more dodge roll iframes?
[191:52.49]That's kind of awesome if it is.
[191:58.38]These are awful options for me.
[192:03.23]I guess uh good luck we get walking stars again that seems fine so you gotta be really strong for the third day these are gonna be really strong like level at least level 10 12.
[192:32.62]and good like at least purple items maybe I don't know uh where are we going um it seems like purple items are items that are like smithing stoned up as well let's get out because I Smithing Stone mine and turn purple let's do it I have a stone sword key uh let's do the church we need flasks church and then uh that yours first
[193:09.36]Then it happened.
[193:12.56]OK.
[193:17.59]Yeah, I feel like we keep going into boss fights with three or four flasks.
[193:20.29]We should probably have like seven or eight.
[193:22.53]We also I don't think we got any talismans.
[193:25.52]I think I just killed the first bug.
[193:38.01]OK.
[193:39.99]Did you get the flask thingy?
[193:41.15]I did.
[193:41.71]Did you get one?
[193:43.89]I think so.
[193:44.69]Our mage is still up there fighting.
[193:46.34]Are we going to the Everjail?
[193:47.48]Let's go Everjail.
[193:48.82]Everjail?
[193:49.70]Sure thing.
[193:50.16]Oh, that's you up there.
[193:52.58]With this one right here?
[193:54.67]Yep.
[193:55.37]Okay.
[193:55.49]I'm activating it.
[193:56.51]I'm coming.
[193:57.07]I'm kind of far away.
[193:57.93]Did you get that flask charge?
[194:00.53]I think so.
[194:01.49]I don't know because I used one.
[194:03.22]Because I have, I think, four?
[194:08.98]Crucible Knight I don't have a parry oh my I have not crucible knighted in so long they are so I forgot he had a ground stomp I'm dead coming are you down in the chasm or is it the oh it's here with you I'm a chasm I'm dying I'm here well I'm here let's see if I can keep him busy
[194:41.06]Oh, is Golden Vow the heal?
[195:04.36]I guess so.
[195:12.75]Die!
[195:38.21]Oh, and a recovery tail swipe.
[195:42.26]I guess not I don't know I'm gonna follow up what's the double follow-up okay owned
[196:11.51]Great enemy, they call that guy.
[196:13.39]Oh, he's fucking great at 20,000.
[196:17.91]Flask slowly restores HP.
[196:20.22]I feel like that sucks.
[196:23.68]Yeah, those effects are always like really, really slow.
[196:26.86]I'll try it.
[196:29.07]I just want to try and get as many levels as I can, to be honest.
[196:34.23]Even though I lost one.
[196:36.37]Alright, you should have four flasks.
[196:40.45]I don't.
[196:41.27]You don't, so you have to go get that item too then.
[196:43.49]That's unfortunate.
[196:52.52]Where was it?
[196:54.58]It's in the church down here.
[196:59.29]Oh no, fuck that.
[197:00.11]It's very far away at this point.
[197:02.51]Is there anything even in here?
[197:06.81]Where did you guys go?
[197:08.47]Oh, I'm just being an idiot.
[197:09.55]We're picking somewhere to go.
[197:10.79]I don't know.
[197:19.52]I'm just following you.
[197:26.07]I feel like learning what everything even does.
[197:31.28]Yeah, it's kind of...
[197:33.32]I feel like there's items that we should be picking up, but I just kind of am not really caring about them.
[197:45.01]Any stones?
[197:46.97]He always sells one.
[197:49.15]Or two.
[197:49.35]Oh, he's selling a fist.
[197:52.12]Weird.
[197:57.36]And also the... The perfumes and the...
[198:02.78]crack tears and stuff you can only get from him shit I don't know if anything's worth maybe I don't know oh circle is coming towards us oh fuck excuse me excuse me I'm so sorry
[198:31.91]You good?
[198:33.95]Yeah.
[198:39.32]Alright, where to?
[198:39.86]Let's go... Oh, another church.
[198:42.77]Let's get the... There's another flask in there for sure.
[198:46.84]Oh, now we're working together.
[198:56.29]I feel like we have not accomplished enough.
[199:02.06]I'm level 8.
[199:03.36]I mean, I could use a better item, but.
[199:17.02]Good, OK.
[199:19.44]Circle is right here.
[199:20.97]Yeah, let's go.
[199:29.20]do you still have a key?
[199:30.96]no those evergales don't seem that hard I mean Crucible Knight was stinky but with three people though it shouldn't be that terrible but yeah no I don't have one it's also really cool with the no fall damage and stuff
[199:51.49]It feels like if there was fall damage, it would be... There's a dragon here.
[199:57.64]Oh, we could do that.
[199:58.94]We could fight dragon.
[200:01.28]I feel like there's always a boss here, and it always fucks us up.
[200:03.69]Like, whatever this boss is, is always really strong.
[200:06.23]He's in a weird spot, though.
[200:07.35]I don't know.
[200:07.73]There's two bosses here, randomly.
[200:10.60]That dragon's not in a good place to fight.
[200:14.84]What other boss?
[200:15.89]Oh, the Deathbird.
[200:17.89]Deathbirds are... I would rather fight ten dragons at the same time.
[200:22.86]Then we're fighting the dragon.
[200:24.38]Alright, let's go.
[200:25.14]This is the worst place to fight this fucking guy, but whatever.
[200:36.62]Um, he has a lot of health.
[200:40.55]I'm telling you, whatever this... Yeah, that ground stomp almost killed me.
[200:51.92]Okay.
[201:02.65]What the hell?
[201:09.88]Oh, God.
[201:14.77]I'm still trying to understand exactly what my ability does.
[201:17.69]That's what makes them, like, show a ghost of themselves sometimes.
[201:23.48]Ow.
[201:26.02]I got her, I got her.
[201:30.14]Get stuck on the wall!
[201:33.41]Oh, fuck you, that... Good thing about that fall damage.
[201:49.18]True.
[202:09.56]Oh, fuck.
[202:19.94]Oh, damage, damage, damage, damage, damage, damage, damage.
[202:29.92]Oh, big damage, big, big, big.
[202:34.96]nice okay we've done it holy uh yeah that's what it's all about uh that's a purple I can do zamora ice storm now
[203:01.96]I just got a way better version of what I was using.
[203:05.06]And a level up.
[203:06.75]Don't mind if I do.
[203:11.75]Alright, we gotta move here.
[203:16.58]Cool.
[203:17.04]Uh, we still got... Oh, it's coming in right now.
[203:22.15]We gotta go.
[203:25.10]Well, we got... That was a big deal.
[203:27.00]That helps us a lot.
[203:33.75]Oops.
[203:36.31]I hope that's not a problem.
[203:49.79]Is this a good idea?
[203:53.37]It looks better than running down to get the other jump.
[203:58.44]Avoid this fucking weirdo.
[204:04.62]There is a shop.
[204:05.62]I don't think I have any... I got nothing.
[204:16.17]Eh.
[204:25.72]God damn fucking Erdtree.
[204:27.74]In it.
[204:31.23]Grab me, sucker.
[204:40.90]Another merchant.
[204:48.05]Really want somebody to take this envoy horn.
[204:54.82]I think the items you see in it are yours.
[204:58.46]Like, I didn't see an envoy horn.
[205:08.94]This backdash...
[205:11.24]I think it has like crazy eye frames I don't know I dodged that arrow um are we just going right to the uh tree uh yeah there's nothing else around here unless you can see any like singular one enemy what am I drinking iced coffee a delicious iced coffee why can't I move
[205:44.36]Oh, this thing is disgusting.
[205:52.39]These one guys, they have to be bugged.
[205:56.26]Yeah, they have way too much health.
[206:05.71]He's being followed by people that like die in two hits.
[206:16.64]Unless he's considered to be like the boss, I guess.
[206:20.65]Alright.
[206:21.29]Oh.
[206:29.00]Try to split him up, I guess.
[206:31.87]the other ones are confused because we're invisible and they're just running in circles and I can't hit them I'll switch target oh my god stop moving around the character's double back step is double dash is great
[207:10.09]Dude, Samora's Ice Storm.
[207:12.55]Pretty fucking lit.
[207:25.32]Oh, you gotta stun him out of this.
[207:29.55]Oh my god.
[207:31.59]You gotta stun him out of this or he just keeps healing.
[207:33.55]Oh.
[207:34.47]Oh shit.
[207:41.88]There we go, one.
[207:49.88]These fucking horses!
[207:50.88]Get back here!
[207:59.85]This calls for some more ice storm!
[208:11.60]Okay, he ends up summoning like undead copies of these anyways.
[208:14.52]Just focus on the main guy.
[208:16.16]Yeah, he needs to get stunned.
[208:23.89]Alright, well he's done with that.
[208:36.83]I'm getting this.
[208:37.31]I'll take care of this guy over here.
[208:44.44]Quit running.
[208:47.06]What the fuck?
[209:00.38]For real.
[209:00.68]See, this is what I mean.
[209:01.48]I think we're pretty weak.
[209:05.99]I think they're just running too much.
[209:15.05]I don't know, I feel like last time we did more damage here.
[209:18.87]Well, we'll get to the third knight at least.
[209:26.02]We're fighting three knights right now, what do you mean?
[209:34.43]Alright, two down.
[209:39.56]Let's go!
[209:45.96]Oh my god, get out of this!
[210:07.10]What the fuck?
[210:07.70]I was way out of range.
[210:11.00]Don't tell that to Miyazaki.
[210:15.07]he's down let's go you did it okay whoa whoa evasive maneuvers strike surroundings with lightning
[210:46.93]These are all kind of bad, but stamina is always good.
[210:53.70]Ah, there's a cooldown.
[210:54.98]I'm going with the stamina.
[211:07.11]You're... I meant to ring the jellyfish.
[211:13.88]Make sure you level up.
[211:15.30]there's a bonfire when we go in the jellyfish cool oh it's day 11. okay Smithing Stone one I still can't do it yeah I don't know I don't know what the Smithing Stone deal is
[211:46.13]Mastered legendary armaments.
[211:48.11]What does that even mean?
[211:51.62]I don't have any legendary armaments.
[211:54.16]No idea.
[211:54.92]I think it's that you have to be a certain level to use certain tiers of weapons.
[212:06.47]I think we're ready just to give it a try.
[212:11.82]Good luck.
[212:23.07]Receive this buff in the beginning.
[212:27.72]Okay.
[212:30.43]And I want you to never make one mistake.
[212:36.36]I won't.
[212:37.84]As long as you adhere to those same rules, it'll be good.
[212:41.07]Yeah, then we'll win.
[212:50.95]So, like, the chicken in the back of the fridge, man.

[214:01.26]Oh my god!
[214:02.54]I gotta get in front of this fucking person!

[215:52.06]No!
[215:52.68]Shit.

[215:58.43]Just keep going?
[215:59.15]Oh, they all went for the wizard!

[216:17.45]You may have to give up on them.
[216:19.13]I gotta run.

[218:11.17]The fort has a... At the top of the tower, there's a map that will lead you to the talisman bugs.
[218:17.18]And you get two of those talismans, and I think that'd be huge.
[218:20.32]I had seen that.
[218:21.43]We got that one time.
[218:22.45]It was quite good.

[254:52.93]Uh-oh.
[255:00.50]Okay.
[255:00.62]You saved my life.
[255:02.10]I tried.
[255:02.42]40 item discovery.
[255:07.05]You know what?
[255:07.39]Fuck the lightning thing.
[255:08.91]I'm just going to keep using Reduvia.
[255:10.05]I had to drop too much stuff.
[255:12.01]Maybe I shouldn't even use it.
[255:15.65]I backstabbed him.
[255:16.47]What?
[255:17.99]I'm going to die down here.
[255:19.65]We're pretty much right next to you.
[255:22.62]I'm just worried about the circle coming in while I'm in the cave.
[255:25.74]Poke, I'm going to level up.
[255:34.93]Should I go in this cave?
[255:38.08]I'm down here, yeah.
[255:41.54]But once, like I'm saying, once the circle comes in, we could get trapped.
[255:45.87]is it any good should I I I wouldn't come in oh I just want to just start walking out I'm just going to kill these last two guys and I think get out of here there's a big goal man I'd like to fight but I think I will die for it oh the tree is down through here to the front
[256:13.66]We leave through the back.
[256:15.99]Where's the tree?
[256:16.43]Where we came in.
[256:18.55]Where we came in.
[256:22.16]Dragon over there.
[256:22.90]I'll come to you guys.
[256:25.72]Uh, the circle's coming in.
[256:26.56]We don't have time for dragon.
[256:29.21]What about this?
[256:30.37]What's this right here?
[256:30.93]This tree.
[256:35.68]Uh, that's where the circle's coming to.
[256:38.20]Okay.
[256:42.79]So we have like time to kill any of the things in here that this place real quick or not.
[256:47.99]Well, it'll close I think we got time I think we have a little bit of time Yeah, it's just the cave can come in at like an awkward angle when you're down there You have to like backtrack through it Wait, I need a fireplace
[257:11.32]fine the same I haven't like leveled up my weapon yet I think it's kind of good how do you restore fp there's some items that are like restore fp on hit there's the starlight shards that a lot of things drop that you should be buying if you really need it say I probably get a couple then
[257:47.72]where's this guy right here where is right here I'm taking damage restores fp on a sword over here
[258:15.74]Takes a lot of mana, but it's good.
[258:19.82]Ow.
[258:23.08]There's one more of these guys.
[258:24.51]That thing is here.
[258:26.01]We're screwed.
[258:27.65]Yikes.
[258:29.93]Oh, I dropped the Starlight Shard here.
[258:31.23]Oh, you ran away.
[258:32.27]The thing was coming.
[258:33.47]I panicked and ran.
[258:38.32]Shoot.
[258:38.74]I had to drop it.
[258:42.70]It's alright.
[258:43.02]I got a couple.
[258:49.37]Oh, apparently I did not need... This Smithing Stone is so weird.
[258:59.83]Alright, let's do this.
[259:01.63]Let's go.
[259:02.29]Gather together, gentlemen.
[259:07.48]Alright, then we can level up and then we can take on the boss.
[259:18.55]Where am I?
[259:20.37]I did that maybe too early.
[259:26.31]Maybe a little too early.
[259:48.80]Oh, God.
[260:15.87]You going fishing?
[260:16.67]This thing hits pretty hard.
[260:19.21]hey oh gosh screw me up yeah that's that's really cool alright boss time
[260:48.05]He's bleeding.
[260:48.83]He's got a fucking blade.
[260:56.32]Wait, look, I can spam these.
[260:58.82]Yeah, if you have spells, do them.
[261:03.69]What the fuck?
[261:04.17]My game just froze.
[261:05.53]I'm lagging the game with these, I think.
[261:07.83]Yeah, they were lagging the shit out of me earlier when I was auto-casting them.
[261:18.14]All of my game.
[261:30.12]Oh, he killed me.
[261:30.90]Careful.
[261:33.58]Oh, no.
[261:38.95]That's cool.
[261:40.05]Oh, hello.
[262:07.46]Dude, leave me alone.
[262:09.01]Someone hit him.
[262:12.93]I'm trying.
[262:15.19]You got a free reign.
[262:18.04]What the fuck?
[262:22.36]I'm going down.
[262:34.80]I'm out of mana.
[262:36.17]Oh, fuck!
[262:38.49]Thank you.
[262:40.08]Thank you.
[262:48.19]Who did that?
[262:49.27]It's one of my special moves.
[262:58.85]I got you.
[263:07.18]Oh.
[263:10.35]Just kill.
[263:10.85]You got it.
[263:12.83]I lagged.
[263:14.49]Nice.
[263:14.85]Now get me before- so I can get my points.
[263:20.62]I think you always get them.
[263:22.54]Nice job.
[263:23.16]I think it always awakens you.
[263:30.55]Ooh.
[263:32.27]Shit.
[263:33.67]I feel like it's this.
[263:35.47]20% damage negation or 15% chance of break stance of enemies.
[263:45.26]I don't know.
[263:49.34]I'm going back to this weapon.
[263:52.48]The damage negation is just amazing.
[263:55.31]Yeah.
[263:55.49]Dude.
[263:58.41]Was that a Ludwig raid?
[264:00.45]What's up?
[264:01.79]I DM'd Ludwig to see if he wanted to play when we were looking for a third like two hours ago.
[264:07.76]And we might play it.
[264:11.13]Not tonight, obviously, but thanks Ludwig.
[264:13.21]Can we go next area?
[264:14.19]Welcome everybody, Night Rain launch.
[264:18.11]Oh no, it's the boss time.
[264:20.80]Let's fucking go.
[264:25.85]Is it boss time?
[264:28.85]I'm not strong enough.
[264:30.77]Hey, actually we're the strongest we probably have been so far.
[264:34.15]That is true.
[264:37.28]I've never been 11 here.
[264:42.44]Just lock in, take it slow.
[264:48.21]Automatically heals life when low thingy would be pretty good.
[264:54.86]I think it ends after this so like if you have leftover souls I think you just need to be buying them wait could some weapons you just can't upgrade like epic no like smithing stones are weird so like you only upgrade them like one time I don't know yeah I have not I guess no reduvia can't even be upgraded at all doesn't show use this to do it
[265:22.51]Level 11, six flasks.
[265:24.03]This could be pretty good.
[265:26.25]We should get pretty close.
[265:35.62]Well, time to open the fridge.
[265:51.11]We just got some subs.
[265:54.13]Thanks for the subs.
[265:56.11]Yo, thanks for the subs.
[265:58.87]What's up, everybody?
[265:59.54]Thank you.
[266:02.30]My hair is going to be wicked fucked up for this one.
[266:04.68]I don't even care.
[266:05.62]We're just going crazy.
[266:10.47]Have you guys not seen this cutscene yet?
[266:18.30]This is the one.
[266:20.93]Neither of you guys have seen this?
[266:23.05]I just broke my chair, hold on.
[266:27.02]It's my first time.
[266:29.60]I said to skip it.
[266:36.31]Oh wait, you're waiting for me.
[266:38.37]Alright, let's do it.
[266:40.26]Use your consumables, use your cool shit.
[266:43.26]I'm gonna wait until like halfway to use them.
[266:54.73]No damn, yeah, I can't even I couldn't even turn my camera fast enough to note.
[267:10.81]Oh, that was that was a true combo Run away
[267:37.89]Oh, I thought I was close enough.
[267:45.02]Good.
[267:45.44]Good start.
[267:54.14]Bad boy.
[267:54.96]Bad, bad, bad boy.
[268:08.20]My god, I'm so squishy!
[268:12.38]Alright, here comes the split.
[268:15.77]You wanna get poked?
[268:17.21]Oh my god, the split deals damage.
[268:26.34]Ay-yi-yi.
[268:31.80]They just spare every angle.
[268:34.29]The camera doesn't turn fast enough.
[268:37.43]Oh fuck, I'll try to get poke.
[268:40.23]I can't- I don't know how it didn't get poke up.
[268:42.52]That was just a lucky attack.
[268:44.64]Oh, he's like guarding your body.
[268:48.80]Try and pile up on each other, poke.
[268:54.19]Oh, did that work?
[268:55.67]Oh my god.
[268:56.15]Yeah.
[268:59.30]I'm sorry, I really fucked up.
[269:01.28]No, I fucked up more.
[269:04.90]Alright, so he's combined.
[269:06.32]Maybe you don't even fight that phase.
[269:07.93]Just kind of run.
[269:08.49]Just wait out.
[269:09.15]Yeah.
[269:19.52]I'm just trying to get close to this fight.
[269:32.64]I just can't.
[269:50.72]That was a lot of damage, but I'm down.
[269:52.64]I'm going to die here.
[269:56.10]I gave us the invisibility.
[270:00.15]Yeah, maybe just run away.
[270:01.87]Try not to get hurt, I guess.
[270:13.16]I think just, yeah, play safe.
[270:14.66]Only take the attacks you can get for sure.
[270:18.46]Also, there might be like a real one.
[270:19.98]There's only one that has the sword on its back.
[270:22.30]Oh, shit.
[270:23.08]I think you're right.
[270:40.68]Oh, good dog.
[270:41.72]Good doggy.
[270:45.02]Alright, combine.
[270:45.70]Here it comes.
[270:51.06]Fucking where did he come from?
[270:58.97]Wait for my ult.
[271:00.60]I have nothing left.
[271:03.22]I got an ult here.
[271:04.10]He starts doing some weird shit down.
[271:07.93]I'll come.
[271:15.90]That's gonna take a lot to get me up.
[271:22.50]I'm distracting him.
[271:24.52]Oh, he's coming back.
[271:25.20]He's coming back.
[271:25.62]He's coming back.
[271:26.43]Oh, God.
[271:29.87]You take... Oh.
[271:33.14]Oh, fuck.
[271:34.18]Oh, that's not good.
[271:34.84]Oh, no.
[271:35.10]The split does damage.
[271:35.96]You're right.
[271:37.77]There is no way I'm going to be able to fucking get you guys.
[271:44.24]Goodbye.
[271:45.40]Damn.
[271:45.72]I messed up pretty bad on that fight.
[271:50.36]Yeah, I stacked damage negation and I still got one shot.
[271:55.65]This class is so squishy.
[271:59.39]This boss is hard.
[272:02.96]Yeah.
[272:04.00]I've had really bad runes for that character.
[272:06.40]I'm hoping to get something better.
[272:12.59]Oh, that's a cool one.
[272:13.43]Starting armament deals lightning damage.
[272:18.53]That's a really good one.
[272:22.86]that's the closest we've been so far that was a solid stuff I think we gotta figure out how to get like damaged stuff early that or uh I think day two we really should have fought that dragon in hindsight when we were all grouped
[272:52.36]Pea time.
[272:54.40]Ooh, love a pea.
[272:57.23]You and me in a tree.
[273:00.88]I don't understand the relic system.
[273:03.63]So there's certain colored slots and you put those colored ones into the slot.
[277:33.46]Alright, I'm going to try to... I want to make some new relic things.
[277:43.08]You should gamble.
[277:45.16]That's what I've been doing.
[277:45.92]It's fun.
[277:47.80]Yeah, I like it.
[277:59.82]Dude, leave me alone.
[278:01.46]You said by the mirror?
[278:06.69]there's an item I'm not sure how it works yet you buy the mirror from the pot guy and I think maybe that is letting you see a ghost in an area and then you need to defeat this ghost boss and I'm doing it right now I'm trying I think I'll just gamble
[278:28.27]Gambus seems like a good bet.
[278:29.57]It seems like this character is a healer.
[278:32.46]I have one charm for it that says, like, spend your health to heal everybody.
[278:38.30]What's Revenant?
[278:40.75]An unlockable character, I assume.
[278:43.41]Oh.
[278:52.16]This place is pretty cool.
[278:53.00]Dude, what the fuck?
[278:54.92]Who's this painter out here?
[278:55.98]Oh, that's one of the characters.
[279:03.86]this is so up okay let me know when you're ready I'm pretty much ready to go and pocket lols
[279:32.28]One moment.
[279:33.66]Last bite.
[279:35.43]What you eating?
[279:38.90]Chicken katsu with I think it's curry dip.
[279:42.73]Oh, that sounds amazing.
[279:46.54]Very good.
[280:08.27]what other character would I even want to play I feel like we're so close to almost beating this first real boss that changing characters right now might not be a good idea like I got a lot of what this guy does down he seems I don't know one of the more well-rounded like I mean you pretty much can use any weapon on any character anyway but his abilities are yeah all useful
[280:43.21]could do birdman birdman was fun can repost with the bow really you mean parry wait what okay I read it
[281:05.26]okay you ready we are ready am I even getting the benefits of this should I just take this off this thing improve attack power with three plus colossal swords I feel like that takes a while to even get that I don't know up to you buster I have just such good relics for the ranger man I'm gonna play him again
[281:39.79]quick meditation session hey pretty good really focused before we get started I agree with poke now that I've seen the light is getting that uh that map room to see where the rolling bugs are yeah I feel like those accessories could make you run early for sure
[282:04.05]every time I get one it's like it's either damage negation or spell like yeah every single one has seemed like a spell one though alright let's do it this is the one uh let's drop on this castle right below us then am I not dropping you can't just jump out I guess not oh let's go
[282:37.04]We're going to have to not be level one as soon as possible.
[282:44.05]I would have loved to get in there.
[282:50.46]Boss.
[283:02.67]Oh, God, I might want to speak because my health bar is
[283:08.33]I fell down.
[283:14.02]Hey, you can't go down a level if you don't get a level.
[283:19.48]Ow, ow.
[283:22.31]This guy blocked me.
[283:23.51]It's his fault.
[283:33.96]Alright, good.
[283:35.58]What does Ender do?
[283:37.42]End your...
[283:39.79]uh you kind of gain a whole bunch of poise and an attack goes through you oh yeah and when you kill bosses like that you just get a grace so yeah you should be doing stuff like that and then up here in this room is where you get the map there's a bunch of chests in here yeah this is a great spot
[284:08.49]yeah it's alright okay db level three did you guys go still leveling up in here coming up did you all get the map when I got it
[284:38.24]I don't like if you look on the map oh yeah we see the other markers okay we should get this one right here only one person can get one so I'm we need to like split up a little bit if we all want to get one if you guys get any additional lightning damage anything I want it not yet I'm going to this one then
[285:08.02]I'm going to go to that one.
[285:10.95]So we should be getting the bugs then, right?
[285:12.99]Yeah.
[285:13.31]Yes.
[285:21.22]Love a bug.
[285:22.30]What's your favorite bug?
[285:24.85]Death fanning beetle.
[285:26.61]And it's not even close.
[285:29.19]They pretend to die.
[285:30.67]They're so cute.
[285:32.45]And they love grapes.
[285:35.36]Defeating enemies restores FP.
[285:38.96]That's good.
[285:40.36]Anyone want that?
[285:41.78]Oh, can't.
[285:51.05]Oh my god, hit him.
[285:57.06]Where is he?
[285:58.38]I'm kind of fucking sleep resistance talisman.
[286:02.43]Where is he?
[286:03.65]Am I crazy?
[286:05.21]Underneath me?
[286:18.43]this one is improve death blight resistance oh great that's fantastic I liked when we went into the big castle and it gave us uh it gave us like a way better talisman you know when we killed the boss in the sewer that seemed like those rewards were big yeah
[286:45.87]This one's improved sorceries 11%.
[286:48.87]That's pretty good.
[286:51.25]If any of us did sorceries.
[286:54.42]Yeah.
[286:55.44]Is there a church anywhere too?
[286:56.48]We need to go.
[286:56.94]We should get a... There's one up here.
[286:59.80]We should get that before the shit closes in.
[287:08.80]Whatever.
[287:12.22]I'm going to get another flask.
[287:25.39]Can you do the peanut butter jelly song?
[287:27.65]I'm not fighting him alone, I don't... It's way too difficult.
[287:29.97]Oh, wow.
[287:33.20]Yeah, we shouldn't get these things actually.
[287:34.90]I got another one and it was perfume.
[287:39.07]I guess they can randomly just be terrible, right?
[287:42.37]No.
[287:44.37]Seems to be a little... more likely to be terrible.
[287:53.45]We are very spread out right now.
[288:05.83]It's not the worst thing, but... Gotta be careful.
[288:13.22]Well, my character will have sleep resistance, so I'm good.
[288:19.11]I found the vendor.
[288:21.06]Increase items, equip slots.
[288:23.92]Are you guys near me?
[288:25.20]Oh.
[288:25.77]No, I want to get this flask.
[288:32.50]Yeah, this place is really good, but I don't feel comfortable doing it alone.
[288:41.25]I'm just in a bad spot.
[288:46.90]I only have stacks of two?
[288:48.28]Fuck.
[288:51.75]OK, Ster.
[288:53.98]I am going to come to you right now.
[288:57.18]Yeah, I'll come to you.
[288:58.00]I got everybody meet here.
[288:59.06]It's going to be big.
[289:00.76]I would recommend if you guys can make it here, get the flask.
[289:03.67]That's where I am right now.
[289:06.31]It's too far.
[289:07.17]There's also a random loan misbegotten over there.
[289:16.24]It will still be in the circle.
[289:23.29]Slayer Jeremy.
[289:25.76]That's me.
[289:32.20]Do you want to kill the Misbegotten, Poke?
[289:35.17]Uh, I was going to start, I think, wait, is it right there?
[289:37.65]He is right over here, but... There's a, there's a ton of the good stuff.
[289:42.14]Um, let's do whatever is right here, though.
[289:44.32]There is a Misbegotten.
[289:45.46]Oh, Circle's coming in.
[289:47.02]It's going to stop right here, though.
[289:49.15]Where is he?
[289:49.47]And then we should immediately go to the castle.
[289:51.63]Here he is right here.
[289:52.81]You better not be fucking lying.
[289:54.45]He's right here.
[290:12.85]Smash him.
[290:20.76]Well met.
[290:25.11]Definitely take that.
[290:28.33]Max HP.
[290:29.77]Nice.
[290:30.07]Okay.
[290:30.77]Make sure you level up.

[297:57.01]Still using the starting weapon.
[298:02.17]I think I'm doing that.
[298:04.29]At low HP, create holy ground and restore HP.
[298:10.85]That's kind of cool.
[298:13.04]How do you do a guard counter?
[298:16.64]We parry with a shield, I think.
[298:18.62]Oh no, guard counter and Elden Ring.
[298:20.50]Yeah, you block and then you attack right after the block.
[298:23.10]You have to do R2.
[298:23.93]You have to do a strong attack.
[298:25.05]So you just hold the shield up regular and just dunk.
[298:27.77]Right after the dunk, you hit R2.
[298:29.41]You go ding and do a big attack.
[298:32.46]I forgot that existed I have the parry like this like just do the block and then yeah just when your shield is hit then you attack it's just a regular block on timing right yeah you hold up the shield and when you get the dunk when somebody bounces off right after that you do r2
[299:05.11]Yeah, I'm more of a support character.
[299:10.65]Hope you guys are okay with that.
[299:13.04]Yeah.
[299:16.24]What is defeating group?
[299:18.66]Gru?
[299:19.04]Defeating a group.
[299:22.45]A big bunch of enemies?
[299:25.43]I guess.
[299:27.63]Uh, church.
[299:30.53]Let's get the church.
[299:32.79]What was this?
[299:39.92]We have big items over here.
[299:41.58]Big items.
[299:48.03]Oh, what's this like giga corrupted thing right here?
[299:54.32]Let's do that.
[299:55.96]That seems like it wants us to do it.
[300:01.25]These things almost killed us in one hit last time.
[300:04.23]This was a very scary thing.
[300:08.15]We didn't have poke, did we?
[300:10.30]I don't remember, but I remember dying in one hit.
[300:13.16]But it is a tree avatar.
[300:15.02]They are pieces of dog shit, so this shouldn't be that big of a deal.
[300:19.09]True.
[300:22.39]What is the recluse's grief?
[300:25.66]Uh, it increases your mana and intelligence.
[300:32.32]Hurts a lot.
[300:38.85]Yeah, it had a random name on it.
[300:50.10]Was it because someone died with it?
[300:54.13]Uh, maybe?
[300:54.95]I think so.
[300:57.61]Cool.
[301:07.55]That's a cliff, guys.
[301:10.18]That is a cliff.
[301:14.44]Guys, there's a cliff there.
[301:17.13]I lost a level for that.
[301:24.26]Ooh, good.
[301:25.14]Big hit.
[301:35.89]Some are saying it deserved.
[301:40.83]Oh shit, doesn't it do the sprinkles?
[301:42.50]Yep, watch out for the sprinkles.
[301:44.44]Oh, fuck.
[301:47.02]I got you.
[301:49.43]No, let me get it.
[301:50.53]I'm really good at it.
[301:52.29]Well, he's coming after you.
[301:53.35]Oh shit, you can just do it from the edge.
[301:56.10]That's right.

[302:02.90]Sprinkles.
[302:22.10]Nice.

[302:35.76]Thank you.
[302:37.94]Alright, what did we get for this?
[302:41.87]That was kind of horrible.
[302:43.73]Ooh, legendary.
[302:52.85]Rise from defeat a single time.
[302:58.20]I got the Golden Order.
[303:04.19]I don't know what to get.
[303:06.54]Siluria's Tree?
[303:08.36]Damage up while spellcasting, or... I guess I'll take this.
[303:13.36]I don't want to get it.
[303:21.53]Okay, well... Level up if you haven't.
[303:25.75]Smoke them if you got them.
[303:27.38]Shield has no bonus on it, that's true.
[303:33.20]I'm not really using it either, am I?
[303:37.69]Alright, um... We gotta move.
[303:41.19]Where are we going?
[303:42.89]This place is... I don't think we ever did get that, um... Church.
[303:46.68]Oh, shit.
[303:47.58]Can we get it?
[303:48.48]You think we can get it quick?
[303:49.94]If we run?
[303:54.63]It's gonna be tight.
[303:56.87]Brother.
[303:59.55]I don't know.
[304:00.12]Is it gonna be too tight?
[304:02.08]Should we abandon it?
[304:03.91]For what?
[304:04.39]Where are we going?
[304:05.14]The church.
[304:05.86]Oh, that church?
[304:06.76]Oh.
[304:07.64]I think we can do it.
[304:08.80]No, we're not making that church.
[304:10.34]Ah, fuck.
[304:12.62]That's bad.

[310:15.63]Okay.
[310:17.47]There is a Tree Sentinel right there, too, if we want to fuck him up.
[310:22.76]Where is he?

[310:24.92]He is right.
[310:27.06]Oh, I think he's a special.
[310:29.21]Yeah, no, I think he's one of the ones that takes a while.
[310:32.51]Too scary.
[310:33.01]I can't believe we haven't beaten the dog yet.
[310:48.03]It's hard.
[310:49.57]This has got to be the one.
[310:50.81]Yeah, we got this.
[310:53.79]We really needed that flask.
[311:00.14]I don't want to be the guy that's talking about the flasks.
[311:06.17]You are, though.
[311:08.35]You are that guy.
[311:09.29]I don't want to get stuck here.
[311:13.50]No, I don't either.
[311:19.30]If you don't get hit, you don't have to use the flask.
[311:24.67]That is very true.
[311:35.39]I gotta remember to blink, guys.
[311:38.97]Oh shit.
[311:39.93]You haven't blinked in a while?
[311:41.73]I feel like it's been like ten minutes.

[312:28.51]Are you a better bow character than me?
[312:30.23]What fucking bow do you have?
[312:31.98]Poke, you just did 4,000 damage to that guy.
[312:34.78]I don't know if that was me.

[312:37.00]Holy shit, Poke.

[320:44.71]I need to up my camera turn speed for real.
[320:51.76]Alright, I think he's going to combine.
[320:54.54]No.
[320:55.70]You're marked.
[320:56.14]I don't know why you're marked, but you're marked.
[320:59.67]Oh, if you shoot the gun, you're stuck animation for five years.
[321:02.87]Oh, man.
[321:04.07]That do be how it is.
[321:07.23]I think I can do some hits on you both.
[321:09.38]Whoa.
[321:09.68]Hello.
[321:11.06]Okay, be aware of his like giant world ending apocalyptic attacks.
[321:17.31]Just keep him busy over there, Ster, so I can get poke.
[321:19.37]He's coming to you.
[321:19.83]He's coming to you.
[321:20.25]He's coming to you.
[321:20.75]He's coming.
[321:22.17]I can start shooting poke.
[321:23.27]Good.
[321:24.73]Oh, it regents so fast.
[321:26.36]Oh, fuck.
[321:27.12]That has such an insane range.
[321:30.34]Just dodge him.
[321:34.40]He's coming to you.
[321:34.88]Coming to you.
[321:35.18]Coming to you.
[321:44.98]I...
[321:46.82]I was even dodge rolling.
[321:47.90]I don't know what to do against that.
[321:49.12]Maybe just run.
[321:49.98]I don't know.
[321:50.89]Are you still not up?
[321:52.93]What the fuck, dude?
[321:54.77]No, it's going all the way.
[321:55.87]It's going all the way.
[321:56.69]I'm going to push these also.
[321:58.20]No, I can get you.
[322:01.46]That didn't work.
[322:04.64]I'm down as well.
[322:07.71]Okay, go for Ster.
[322:08.29]Focus Ster.
[322:08.79]I think Ster can res better.
[322:11.98]I mean, if you can get it, well... Man.
[322:20.11]Okay, so welcome everybody.
[322:22.51]Welcome to my Let's Play series of Elden Ring Night Rain.
[322:28.40]Started the recording right here just because I figured it's a good place to start the video.
[322:34.60]So we... We'll start it over again.
[322:41.29]Oh my god, I have full health!
[322:44.90]Oh yeah, he gets the avoid death one.
[322:47.38]What the fuck?
[322:47.92]I forgot I had that.
[322:52.15]Fuck it, I'll kill him.
[322:53.01]I'll kill him.
[322:53.41]I'll do it.
[322:54.17]I'll do it.
[322:54.51]I'll do it.
[322:54.77]I'll kill him.
[323:06.15]Try not to move.
[323:06.69]Why is it moving so much?
[323:10.05]I'm trying to just get on top of you same.
[323:12.47]I'm trying to like turn around just fucking walk on keeps I mean Jerma just wins these he does
[323:39.98]Oh, fuck you!
[323:41.29]Already?
[323:41.73]Do you have your ult?
[323:57.10]No, unfortunate.
[323:59.58]Any of those heal items?
[324:01.30]I don't, they're all gone.
[324:08.55]You're not going to get us unless he's in one phase.
[324:18.70]Nice try.
[324:19.47]That was so hard.
[324:20.91]I had one bad death and I feel like I
[324:24.45]I led us to the chain reaction failure no you did it it was me I shot the gun and it I just stood there like forever I couldn't move dude has rivers of blood and he's shooting the gun the rivers of blood it had no matter hey that was the farthest we've been I take the blame there and I say we go again and kill that boss there is no blame
[324:52.87]Yeah, we got him.
[324:53.63]It's a very difficult encounter.
[324:58.97]I think I might just try and stay alive as the ranger so that I can get everyone else up.
[325:08.24]You got a pocket watch.
[325:09.08]How do you use that?
[325:11.02]You give it to the white cloak lady.
[325:15.05]What if I want to use it instead?
[325:17.73]You still get to keep it.
[325:19.55]Just show it to her.
[325:22.45]she'll uh do a smash brothers brawl I need to get a katana that's kind of awesome seems oh a katana yeah yeah I don't know if I like this character I have now because I think it's all about parrying and I'm weak at that
[325:52.39]Parrying's hard, and then when you get to a boss like that, I don't even think you can parry it.
[325:56.45]Yeah.
[325:57.11]I'm so squishy.
[326:00.42]You could just be Big Shield Boy or whoever.
[326:02.48]The character you unlock is kind of fun.
[326:05.16]Yeah, but you're her.
[326:07.27]Uh, no, I was playing Ranger.
[326:09.07]Oh, wait, really?
[326:10.67]Yeah, she's a little quirky, though.
[326:14.28]Because her ult is, like, the invisibility.
[326:17.06]Oh.
[326:18.40]I'm going to try the big dude, though.
[326:20.50]It's Sekiro-style parries on that guy?
[326:22.64]Really?
[326:26.83]Yeah, I think it's different.
[326:28.73]Yeah, he's the time... Dude, I'm fucking playing him.
[326:31.13]What?
[326:31.99]Yeah, do it.
[326:32.33]I think you might like him.
[326:33.73]I love that.
[326:34.59]He's really cool.
[326:35.54]I just don't know how to parry.
[326:36.46]Like, I'm not a good guy at that.
[326:37.66]Does he get it all the time?
[326:39.62]Is chat baiting me?
[326:41.02]I think you switch forms and you can do it whenever you want.
[326:44.41]Like, you activate the form with no cooldown and you just can parry whenever you want.
[326:50.54]Only parries on his super sword.
[326:53.00]Holy shit.
[326:54.20]This guy's ass is in my camera when he's sprinting.
[326:59.37]This is not okay.
[327:05.98]Jerma, switch to him and just start sprinting.
[327:08.48]Which one?
[327:09.76]The parry?
[327:11.40]Guy in copper armor.
[327:14.39]What?
[327:14.59]It's padding.
[327:18.65]His ass is fine to me.
[327:22.40]Is the executioner's blade a katana?
[327:31.20]Uh, what sword?
[327:33.22]The default starting equipment for the ass guy?
[327:37.99]Uh, yeah.
[327:38.31]Uh, yeah.
[327:38.99]It's a katana.
[327:40.76]Bleed.
[327:41.74]Has unsheathed.
[327:47.10]You think there's any more customization to the characters?
[327:50.39]Yes.
[327:51.91]There is.
[327:55.17]But we have to beat this boss.
[327:57.24]Oh, you think so?
[327:57.74]Okay.
[327:58.56]Yeah.
[328:03.15]What is... Is it bad if we both are Katana Man?
[328:08.69]I don't think I'm actually going to be him.
[328:10.30]He's super squishy.
[328:12.58]I feel like he's squishy.
[328:14.00]I could be wrong, though.
[328:15.59]cool with the one trick pony he gets like an alt weapon that's the only one you can deflect with maybe I'll try mage that's a little weird I'll try the mage alright what is it should I buy anything
[328:51.65]Does it still have bleed?
[328:53.31]Like just actual bleed?
[328:55.58]Yeah.
[328:56.20]The katana that guy had had bleed on it.
[329:05.65]Oh, I've been using it.
[329:08.86]Okay.
[329:09.42]The mage can put on the pocket watch.
[329:14.05]Yep.
[329:18.14]so you're playing mage I'm gonna do mage gravity sorcery let's do this oh I got a I just gambled and I got a grand like a tranquil scene and it's for wilder only it says
[329:41.99]follow-up attacks possible when using great character skill and shit like yeah there's some really good freaking abilities yeah you can get like specific ones cool alright you guys ready to rock and roll oh hold on I'm pacific I meant passive or specific I don't know what it is long day
[330:13.64]Improved attack.
[330:14.56]Yeah, I got another one of those three three claws equipped.
[330:19.43]That's never going to happen.
[330:33.45]Since Flintstone.
[330:43.90]Yeah, I don't know I just don't have very good relic for anyone else
[331:15.52]I'm ready So you have to pull affinity off of people when you do enough damage to them?
[331:39.03]I guess I'm ready I'm ready Unless
[331:46.30]I'm ready I haven't seen any cold weapons like at all you should do the parry guy though Ster I think you would like them actually I feel like I'm getting baited I feel like I'm gonna play awful the first game I play and I really want to beat the boss true so what does the magic cocktail do I don't know are you in the training area yeah I wish we could see each other in here
[332:24.49]I might have just figured out a cool strategy, though.
[332:30.54]With this guy, what if, like, on the boss, when you guys are dead, I put the square down, and I can rez.
[332:37.21]The pillar.
[332:40.42]Ooh, a resurrection would be amazing.
[332:43.08]With Duchess, you can go invisible and rez as well.
[332:48.35]Oh, really?
[332:49.55]Yeah.
[332:53.37]I'm ready.
[332:54.23]I guess I'm the only one not ready.
[332:55.71]You guys actually ready?
[332:57.77]I mean, this might be a fuckface run, considering I... Okay, if this is a fuckface run, maybe I should try the Katana guy.
[333:06.64]Maybe with the Katana guy, you'll end up being crazy with it.
[333:08.76]Yeah, I'm playing Mage.
[333:11.05]What does his other sword scale with?
[333:12.91]Like, if you have to equip it.
[333:16.67]No, you don't have to.
[333:17.54]It's a stance you switch to with any weapon.
[333:19.86]Yeah, but then what is the damage of that weapon based on when you're attacking with it?
[333:25.93]uh is this a good Jerma what take your face away from the microphone I have a compressor and it's doing that oh it scales with level understand oh my god man seek help I didn't do anything
[333:50.07]Is he eating ice?
[333:51.21]Did he eat ice?
[333:51.97]Yeah.
[333:52.69]Is he eating ice right into the mic?
[333:55.15]No, I'm not.
[333:55.97]I'm deliberately backing away from the mic.
[333:59.16]Okay.
[334:03.63]Alright, I believe you.
[334:05.51]I am so far away.
[334:07.39]Alright, let's go.
[334:07.95]Fuckface run.
[334:10.16]If this is the one we went on to.
[334:13.42]We all just like, let's try different shit.
[334:15.88]I can't get this character's ass out of my face.
[334:18.39]I know.
[334:20.64]face run that's one of the funniest things ever it's like you're chewing that in my ear there is wait why am I alone multiplayer session failed there is I think it's because I died I just walked alone
[334:44.61]Uh, there is a solid, a full ruler could fit between me and the microphone.
[334:49.30]Could you mute maybe?
[334:50.34]I don't know how to do that.
[334:52.28]Is it, what button is it?
[334:54.06]You mute on Discord every time you stand up.
[334:55.57]Bro, you literally change your lows and highs when you don't have a mute.
[334:59.01]That's so bullshit.
[335:01.92]Alright, I gotta mute.
[335:02.70]That's so bullshit.
[335:03.52]I gotta mute, you're right.
[335:14.44]uh it's just you poke so I think there are there are eight what do you mean just me oh they're ready there are eight day three bosses in the game right now I wonder how much harder the other ones are oh my god wait what do you mean what do you mean by day three though is there past day three
[335:41.09]just like the the big three-headed dog that we're fighting apparently there's eight other super omega bosses like that then after that it's over um I would imagine they're probably going to be adding stuff to the game but we seem to be having a lot of trouble getting to the dog so I bet you I mean yeah I think we I think we got them we'll definitely this is a face run so we'll see
[336:11.87]I have to like see what this guy's... This character even does.
[336:27.01]Oh, church right below us.
[336:28.17]Two churches.
[336:28.97]Drop.
[336:29.81]We want that church right there.
[336:33.64]This is a huge RNG.
[336:39.24]Oh, this is the run.
[336:40.29]That's massive actually.
[336:42.97]This guy always talks about the church.
[336:45.41]Yeah, it's the most important zone in Elden Ring.
[336:51.74]Bingo.
[336:53.86]It actually is really very good.
[336:55.58]Yeah, he's right.
[336:57.84]If we could get them all now, it would be really big.
[337:01.49]Is there only two total?
[337:02.57]We should get the right one first, too.
[337:04.59]After that.
[337:05.17]Even the left one.
[337:05.95]Absolutely.
[337:06.73]We should just go get them all.
[337:09.85]What about this dragon?
[337:16.69]We fuck it up?
[337:19.46]This is probably worth it.
[337:24.14]You can level up.
[337:25.42]Yeah, level up first.
[337:26.52]Wait, I hear this little bolt.
[337:34.39]Oh, I see.
[337:34.99]Oh, blood loss?
[337:36.09]Yo, for you, start right here.
[337:37.79]Oh, sir.
[337:40.36]Coming.
[337:41.36]I'm just getting us some extra XP.
[337:47.77]And then we're going to fuck up the dragon.
[337:50.03]Yeah, this is big for you, sir.
[337:51.23]You're welcome.
[337:53.42]Can I please walk on to the right?
[337:59.31]Yeah.
[338:00.81]I'm here.
[338:02.23]Oh, you marked it.
[338:03.49]No, no, no.
[338:04.89]It's right here.
[338:06.18]I'm just standing on it.
[338:08.51]this dragon might be really strong over where there's a relic on the floor right here where oh what are we thinking oh that's really good uh let's fight it and see how much damage it takes okay
[338:35.57]I'm dead.
[338:36.67]I'm dead.
[338:36.90]Oh, you guys are both dead!
[338:54.19]No!
[338:56.78]Dude, what?
[338:57.58]I'm dead too.
[339:00.18]Uh, reset?
[339:06.00]We just got two flasks.
[339:07.68]We can't reset.
[339:08.44]We can do it.
[339:09.20]We just run away from this.
[339:10.21]We just run away from... Just run.
[339:12.93]I lost him.
[339:14.95]I almost just said the F word.
[339:16.92]Fucking... The F?
[339:20.56]Wait, the F word?
[339:22.40]I said fucking.
[339:23.91]There's a dungeon right next to the bonfire if we want to go down here instead.
[339:28.11]We should have gone down here.
[339:29.44]Fuck.
[339:32.42]I lost a level.
[339:34.84]Fuck.
[339:37.98]Yeah, well, you lost the least valuable level.
[339:40.66]That is true.
[339:42.44]Where are you guys?
[339:43.12]He's right up on me.
[339:44.60]I don't like it.
[339:46.27]We went down into the dungeon.
[340:03.16]Into the dungeon.
[340:04.48]Save some for me.
[340:08.18]I don't like this character one bit yeah I'm sorry I knew it too oh this guy's big my pillar is just there
[340:38.17]the counter thing is nice biggest dog nice
[341:05.19]Finally, a Smithing Stone II.
[341:07.01]Who wants it actually?
[341:09.25]It's all of ours.
[341:10.05]That's the choice.
[341:11.03]Oh.
[341:12.40]You know, it would make sense that you get the Smithing Stone II by coming into the Smithing Stone area.
[341:19.40]Yeah.
[341:21.05]That is true.
[341:22.81]That's pretty interesting.
[341:27.35]There's still another.
[341:28.33]Oh, no.
[341:28.76]You come out the other side.
[341:31.14]Yeah, that enemy is not even hard to fight.
[341:35.95]Oh, the enemy?
[341:38.05]The big guy we killed.
[341:40.21]It's hard for me.
[341:42.06]Your big dog was OP.
[341:43.94]So I can... My ultimate is a mark?
[341:46.10]Is it... Okay, uh... You deal more damage, and apparently when you hit the mark enough, that's what was dealing the 4,000 damage bursts.
[341:56.03]Oh.
[341:57.67]Also, it has a really short cooldown.
[342:00.35]You'll, like, kill most normal enemies just by using it.
[342:02.99]Yeah.
[342:03.11]It's really good.
[342:05.31]You're so smart.
[342:11.20]Did that sound weird?
[342:13.04]Uh, yeah.
[342:13.85]Yeah, no, it did.
[342:14.47]Don't let him do that.
[342:18.81]Sorry.
[342:19.19]It was perfectly reasonable.
[342:31.81]Are these guys even giving good experience?
[342:33.39]Uh oh, we forgot the church on the left.
[342:36.25]Oh shit, we did.
[342:37.85]We got distracted by the dragon.
[342:40.39]Stupid has dragon.
[342:42.96]Oh, the super RNG start two churches.
[342:46.42]Let's let's leave.
[342:49.57]Oh, I'm dead, aren't I OK?
[342:54.07]This is an awful start.
[342:56.64]I did not know the circle was coming in and I'm still underground.
[343:01.86]OK, I think I think I'm getting out.
[343:04.63]You should be alright.
[343:07.51]Oh God, am I?
[343:09.24]I'm gonna.
[343:15.77]I don't know if I'm alright guys.
[343:17.90]Actually kind of cool.
[343:19.86]Believe.
[343:30.53]oh are you alright what if we did this under boss oh wait we can't wait uh can't we yeah it's too too risky I'm gonna die right at the edge the fight like okay what am I doing
[344:01.53]You guys can actually maybe get me.
[344:05.98]Oh, no.
[344:08.34]Oh!
[344:10.04]Did that... Would that have saved you?
[344:12.12]Yes, it would have.
[344:12.94]If you hit me, it would have reset the timer.
[344:14.91]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[344:17.13]How did I miss?
[344:18.41]We just gotta move.
[344:19.63]Well, I lost all of my runes and my level, and we have accomplished nothing, and the circle's already coming.
[344:25.48]Can we actually get a restart?
[344:28.14]Let's do it for you.
[344:28.72]I don't even like this character.
[344:31.25]at all well if we're doing a restart I'm going to get another drink and piss him this is my best friend but okay well now you know now you know he's your guy are we actually just bailing I'm I'm I'm killing myself I'll be right back I'm gonna go pee okay are we just dying I think we're just dying find a creative way to do it
[345:14.40]First one to die wins.
[345:17.06]Actually, gonna be kind of hard.
[345:20.16]Oh, this guy.
[345:30.29]No, kill me first.
[345:34.46]Oh, you brought me back to life.
[345:36.68]Wait, wait.
[345:40.22]Wait, that's the strat.
[345:41.74]Ster is alive again, by the way.
[345:46.09]Oh crap.
[345:47.77]They're his characters alive.
[345:50.48]Wait, why was I trying to res you?
[345:55.42]I guess we can't we just like leave the lobby?
[345:58.61]I guess.
[345:59.65]Because he's BRB.
[346:05.46]But maybe he gets pulled up on.
[346:09.97]Wait, we're back.
[346:11.47]Yeah, I'm just going to leave the lobby.
[346:13.54]I'm back.
[346:14.27]I was being... We die again?
[346:16.05]What do we do?
[346:17.57]I think... Just go to title.
[346:20.45]Yeah.
[346:22.56]You'll have to re-invite us.
[346:31.71]Did it not work?
[346:38.42]Wait, wait, wait.
[346:39.66]Return to title screen will incur a penalty.
[346:43.03]Wait, I'm in a penalty.
[346:46.47]Guys, just die.
[346:47.71]What happened?
[346:48.99]I went back to main menu and it says I should rejoin, so I'm rejoining.
[346:52.32]We cannot.
[346:53.96]We have to die at a boss, apparently.
[347:02.31]Well... I got banned.
[347:06.01]The Crucible Knight will kill us both.
[347:07.82]I don't know if this counts as a boss.
[347:11.71]Where's the restart run Miyazaki?
[347:24.73]Oh well now Poke's not dead.
[347:25.93]Hey guys.
[347:32.22]Alright, so we're all dead.
[347:33.85]Ster, you're back.
[347:39.03]We have to wipe at a night bus.
[347:43.40]So we have, we have to play it out.
[347:46.59]Hey, watch us get it done.
[347:48.01]And this is the one we win.
[347:51.50]I'm down.
[347:53.78]Level one.
[348:01.75]Wait, this is Alvin Eric's boss.
[348:03.74]These guys are a boss.
[348:05.92]Hey, they're kicking our ass.
[348:16.36]Marking.
[348:23.27]Yeah, let's do an SL1 challenge.
[348:24.67]We don't level once.
[348:27.56]I have to imagine that's going to be so horrible in this game.
[348:34.10]SL1 challenge, no group.
[348:36.69]Wait, no, full group.
[348:39.25]Yeah, I'm done.
[348:43.88]You get me.
[348:50.50]I get you look what you did Ster I did this I mean no quitting is probably really good for like um with like random teammate lobbies yeah you're kind of wasting your time if you do it so then what if you get stuck with a person who doesn't want to play he just stands there
[349:18.95]You can't leave.
[349:20.31]Poe, could you see what the penalty was?
[349:22.96]No, it just said penalty.
[349:24.40]I wonder what it is.
[349:33.42]I think they send you a fine in the mail.
[349:35.88]A couple thousand dollars.
[349:51.00]I think we're dead again.
[349:52.56]We actually are going to die again.
[349:56.66]I got a warning for downloading Game of Thrones once.
[350:01.97]Wait, what?
[350:04.27]That's pretty modern.
[350:05.93]Yeah, it says, yo, this IP download, episode four, Game of Thrones.
[350:12.64]Really?
[350:13.04]We're going to send you a fine, yeah.
[350:16.04]What the fuck?
[350:17.26]That's crazy.
[350:18.74]I mean, I got a bunch of those back in, like,
[350:22.43]Like, early 2000s.
[350:23.88]You got a bunch of these?
[350:26.16]Yeah.
[350:26.64]When, like, Mindwire was a thing.
[350:28.50]A stack of fucking, like, Motion Picture Association of America warning letters?
[350:34.01]Not a stack, but, like, I don't know.
[350:35.75]It happened on occasion.
[350:36.93]My mom would get freaked out.
[350:38.88]Like, are you guys stealing movies?
[350:43.52]I get that.
[350:48.45]So do we just die now?
[350:50.45]We need the boss to show up.
[350:55.56]You guys never downloaded a car?
[351:16.17]Dude, you stink at this game, sir.
[351:23.08]Yeah?
[351:23.76]How many times have you died?
[351:26.47]Yeah, you get to say that from behind your freaking magic wand.
[351:31.73]Imagine someone just got here 30 seconds ago.
[351:33.51]They're like, what the fuck is this?
[351:35.28]These guys are terrible.
[351:35.92]They're level one at the boss.
[351:39.40]hey there we go alright now let's do it now I have to pee and I want to take a quick break and then I'm going to be back and then we can do it pick the characters you want check out your new runes uh Ster it's just you and me in a party right now I don't know if that's a big deal but that's upsetting why did you bait me into playing this cursed character
[356:17.26]Well, I believe in you.
[356:18.85]Alright, I'll do it.
[356:23.53]Alright.
[356:23.71]I'm gonna play as the Revenant.
[356:36.41]We're going a camless run.
[356:39.69]Oh, shit.
[356:40.59]He's serious when it's camless.
[356:42.30]Yeah, that's what I'm fucking talking about.
[357:02.56]Maybe I could buy one of these.
[357:04.00]I'm going to try to buy a blue gem.
[357:07.14]That sounds good.
[357:10.53]Hell yeah, I took off all my shit too, Jerma.
[357:17.23]Yeah, you camless?
[357:20.32]Oh, fuck.
[357:26.53]I should get this.
[357:30.99]Oh, fuck, I'm not even live.
[357:33.40]I love that joke.
[357:39.23]I don't care.
[357:40.81]It's a great one.
[357:53.63]It reminds me of those Mega64 videos back in the day.
[358:00.98]One of his skits, Rob goes...
[358:02.94]Like, oh, is this recording?
[358:03.84]Alright, let's go.
[358:15.21]These are the gaming hours right here.
[358:25.20]Alright.
[358:26.45]I'm actually I'm ready to kill this freaking.
[358:29.41]I'm ready to let loose.
[358:34.39]I'm ready to let this bird tell me what's up alright let's let's get it situated here massive damage massive coordination let's get a good seed should we look at the map and rush the churches ASAP and don't go don't go for a dragon
[358:58.59]I think we skip any early bosses that we find.
[359:01.05]Unless they're really shitty.
[359:05.30]Isn't this like the same spot?
[359:07.16]Go to the right.
[359:07.66]Go to the right.
[359:08.28]Hit this church at the bottom.
[359:10.20]And we'll hug the right wall.
[359:12.31]Should we try to get them all?
[359:13.65]It's going to be hard.
[359:14.17]I think so.
[359:16.03]There's this one all the way to the left too.
[359:27.94]Bad seed.
[359:28.50]Let's just restart.
[359:30.50]Yeah, let's just die.
[359:33.46]Let's kill this horseman and then level up.
[359:37.17]I somewhat agree.
[359:50.62]I got super tunnel vision right there playing as a mage.
[359:55.20]I just missed with that.
[359:58.45]uh the ghost is mine we got we got ghost summoner in the building oh you're like a spirit summoner oh shit did I just okay what's that grace I got the whole crew okay everybody's level two we're good everything's we're having a good time 3 700 for a first level write that down
[360:34.56]Did I get it?
[360:36.50]Yep.
[360:36.60]Okay.
[360:36.72]Alright.
[360:37.04]Let's go.
[360:38.04]Next one.
[360:39.50]Boink.
[360:40.30]Or should we go boink?
[360:41.77]Should we do the left one?
[360:43.55]Yeah.
[360:44.07]Left one.
[360:44.95]Right one.
[360:45.67]Right one.
[360:46.15]Where me and Poke pinged it.
[360:48.31]It looks like, I mean, the churches must all start on the edges.
[360:52.14]So you kind of have to get them early.
[360:55.46]And then you just want to rush the one on the left after this?
[361:00.37]Because that's all the way across the other side of the map.
[361:02.89]I think we can do it.
[361:04.19]I don't think it's worth doing that many.
[361:07.30]You don't think so?
[361:08.32]I think we need to get the power going.
[361:13.63]What about this golem over here?
[361:20.64]I don't know.
[361:20.92]Okay.
[361:23.06]There's a big golem here.
[361:24.04]There is a huge golem.
[361:27.17]I don't know if it's easy.
[361:28.39]Oh, no.
[361:28.67]Yeah, this golem's easy.
[361:29.57]Let's do it.
[361:32.52]Oh, boy.
[361:55.50]Oh, shit.
[361:56.34]I didn't know he was coming down here.
[362:08.21]Easy peasy.
[362:09.38]Okay, are you guys having any problems with the lock on?
[362:11.50]I feel like when I try to change enemies, sometimes it just doesn't do it.
[362:14.70]Like hitting left and right.
[362:16.28]A little bit.
[362:16.93]Oh, you got a stone sword key.
[362:18.25]Yeah, we did.
[362:23.69]And there was a grace right here to level.
[362:27.00]Is there an item under here?
[362:27.86]Yeah, there is.
[362:31.10]Oh, nice.
[362:32.05]Oh, yes.
[362:33.83]That's kind of fucking amazing.
[362:40.11]Should we open this key right under here?
[362:42.83]The key or no?
[362:45.47]The stone sword key or go for the church fast?
[362:47.64]You said there was a grace out there.
[362:48.70]I'm going to go for the church.
[362:50.88]I'm going for the church.
[362:53.66]Yeah, we got to get the church.
[362:57.55]I missed the item.
[362:58.81]Wait, what?
[363:01.31]Yeah, after the giant, there was an item orb.
[363:07.34]Woohoo!
[363:12.15]I think just getting two churches is like kind of big.
[363:16.88]I would dare say it's probably a necessity to get at least two.
[363:22.57]Three Estus flasks for how horrible that last boss really is.
[363:26.47]No way.
[363:28.29]Oh, there's a whole bunch of like awful enemies here.
[363:33.34]A worm face boss.
[363:36.69]I think this it's coming in.
[363:40.93]bro there is a worm yeah I got it five blasts I don't think I've ever had five flasks
[364:01.16]are we just not fighting the worm moving on um I can come but the circle's coming in and I got spooked you need to make sure you get the church before you can't get I got it this character is sick this character feels like they're animated for a entirely different video game like everything looks so good what are we hitting up here
[364:29.37]oh there's this like other church or thing over there there's some cool stuff in it oh the big worm are we not fighting worm face right here I I mean we're all here okay let's do it my ability makes us immune we're even always up there I did that I don't know how long it lasts oh I have that new group
[365:05.37]I'm gonna try to do this shit, I guess.
[365:09.89]What the fuck is he doing?
[365:14.30]Oh, that's death light bullshit.
[365:15.86]I don't even know where you guys are.
[365:17.57]Kill this.
[365:19.21]Yeah, up here.
[365:21.89]Very up.
[365:23.46]Oh, fuck.
[365:25.70]I feel like he's hard to kill, man.
[365:28.74]I think we have to run.
[365:29.54]I don't think we have time.
[365:32.11]Wait, I'm killing him now.
[365:39.30]Oh my god, that hurt a lot.
[365:43.45]Oh, I'm dead.
[365:44.51]Oh, never mind.
[365:53.42]We're killing it.
[366:00.53]Mage is really easy to get tunnel vision, but it's pretty damn good.
[366:10.05]improved item discovery 40 is that worth uh circle still coming in and yeah 40 is pretty high but I don't know exactly what it's doing should I got the runes thing I up I freaked up sorry this dude's fricked up where are we going
[366:36.78]Uh, there's a church or thingy right here.
[366:38.92]It's safe.
[366:39.94]Do you want to go in there?
[366:41.66]Or a castle, whatever this is.
[366:46.29]Could be a boss.
[366:50.61]This is the envoys.
[366:53.27]They're kind of outside the range.
[366:56.02]I'm going to keep running north.
[366:57.60]The castle's north.
[366:58.46]Let's go north.
[366:59.10]Fuck them.
[367:00.82]Fuck them?
[367:02.06]Fuck them.
[367:03.30]Fuck them, run.
[367:05.15]Run.
[367:13.16]I miss when you were chewing ice.
[367:15.04]Well, somebody had a big problem with it.
[367:20.03]It was very, very loud.
[367:25.32]Does he not get that?
[367:38.01]Did I unsummon him when I'm doing that?
[367:41.98]I can't change targets sometimes, yeah.
[367:51.66]Oh, I died.
[367:54.70]I got you.
[367:59.41]Why does it not do that?
[368:00.55]I want to target you.
[368:07.06]Um, hello?
[368:07.90]What?
[368:08.68]What the fuck is my guy doing?
[368:13.79]Probably... Oh, Storm Sword Key.
[368:28.33]We should go use it.
[368:29.67]Yeah.
[368:30.77]The first one.
[368:39.64]Wait, all the way top is the map, right?
[368:42.18]Yeah.
[368:46.09]I think we can handle it.
[368:57.61]Handle what?
[368:58.63]The stone sword key.
[369:04.92]Oh, the one over there.
[369:07.80]The right?
[369:08.32]There is one right above us.
[369:10.40]And it's closer to the middle.
[369:12.11]Maybe that's one safer.
[369:13.87]This one here.
[369:14.25]Let's get this accessory.
[369:18.58]let's freaking do it oh yeah every time we jump down here it's like oh yeah there's nowhere to go this uh scrumptious little crunchies right here hold on oh never mind yeah I don't know how to select my other summons or like how it's working I don't get it yet
[369:46.76]Ooh, improved spellcasting speed 60 over here.
[369:49.12]Epic.
[369:49.32]Holy shit.
[369:50.63]I would love that.
[369:52.79]Another one over here.
[369:53.49]There's another ball here.
[369:55.45]Oh, man, that's fucking huge.
[369:58.30]Thank you, Poke.
[370:02.73]Another one right here.
[370:09.78]I said there's another one too.
[370:11.74]Let me see what it is first.
[370:12.42]Uh, circle's coming in.
[370:14.23]Improved chain attack finishers.
[370:15.79]I think that's for me.
[370:16.37]We have to leave.
[370:17.36]We can't.
[370:18.34]We'll have to do... the jail on the day two.
[370:23.43]Oh, I need, like, two fucking runes.
[370:36.51]Oh my god, I was not paying attention.
[370:38.21]I was so stupid.
[370:39.17]I'm so sorry.
[370:39.73]That was dumb.
[370:41.41]Are you dead?
[370:42.03]Nope, I'm alright.
[370:43.46]I would love to not... I knew it was behind me too, and I just was such an idiot about it.
[370:51.15]Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
[370:56.97]You're a beautiful, young, growing baby boy.
[370:59.36]And you look... You look like a teenager.
[371:08.79]Where's your cam?
[371:10.85]We lost in the last fight and I just rage ripped it out of the cord.
[371:14.25]Right here?
[371:16.77]Should I do this thingy?
[371:18.66]Open Evergol?
[371:20.68]No, no, no, no.
[371:21.96]Oh crap, I opened it.
[371:23.34]Okay.
[371:24.78]Well, why'd you ask?
[371:29.73]Yeah, I'm running away from them.
[371:32.87]You don't think we can do this shit?
[371:35.55]Is that gonna go all the way?
[371:36.47]In the allotted time?
[371:41.41]No, I don't think you can do it.
[371:43.69]Good luck.
[371:52.11]That gives me gas.
[371:53.39]Come on.
[372:11.92]oh no oh no nice what happened oh you guys man I'm trying to I'm trying to hurt him I'm right behind you Ster

[372:59.96]Oh, Poke, are you hurt?
[373:02.56]Oh, I don't think I'll make it.
[373:03.77]Oh, no.
[373:08.20]There's just no way.
[373:10.12]Oh, it's in trouble.
[373:13.46]Oh, that's a heavy attack.
[373:18.37]Ah, OK.
[373:19.74]Cool.
[373:27.65]That was crazy.
[373:31.23]That was a ton of fucking damage.
[373:33.69]Oh my god, maybe I can make it!
[373:36.18]I actually did it!
[373:37.76]I actually survived!
[373:41.75]Yeah, look at us not using melee characters.
[373:43.53]We're gonna roll this boss.
[373:47.08]That's a cool skeleton enemy you got there.
[373:50.18]Yeah, you get three different summons I get to choose.
[373:54.89]And my ability I'm casting is invulnerability.

[376:14.67]No, just kill the boss.
[376:15.43]Just kill the boss.
[376:18.72]Die.
[376:22.48]Kill him.
[376:25.99]I got the souls.
[376:29.13]Epic.
[376:32.52]Thank you.
[376:39.91]Restores FP upon guarding.
[376:41.27]Do I have to actually guard or can I just hold L1?
[376:49.44]Wow.
[376:52.55]They're all terrible.
[376:53.19]Alright.
[376:57.15]We need to go to an Everjail.
[376:59.38]Get a shield.
[377:04.30]Level up Everjail.
[377:06.37]You got it.
[377:09.05]Or we can go to these ruins that are right here.
[377:16.30]You want to do the top middle?
[377:17.80]Evergill, down there.
[377:19.51]Okay.
[377:26.29]Anybody got a dumpy shield I can use?
[377:28.74]I've got a big fucking dumpy.
[377:31.82]Oh, shield.
[377:32.88]True, but that's not what I asked.
[377:35.21]I didn't listen to the rest.
[377:42.25]You see a crappy shield, let me know.
[377:51.94]What was that?
[377:55.38]We going the right way?

[378:58.41]The water pick, yeah.
[379:00.63]I just take my dentures out.

[380:13.61]Too much bullshit.
[380:26.62]Chimera is aggroed to my Skeleton.
[380:30.42]Oh crap, who's that healer?
[380:38.15]Oh shit, he is here!
[380:43.97]I love when we're in calls and I'll like say something, but it'll only shock you like a minute later when it actually is like, oh wait, he wasn't lying.
[380:53.06]We all got shit going on right now, okay?
[380:55.16]Like there's fucking fighting, there's 10 enemies on the screen.
[380:57.91]We all got stuff going on right now.

[381:13.40]Good idea.
[381:21.61]Elder Lion.
[381:23.56]One more beast for the brigade.
[381:26.68]I feel strong.
[381:27.32]I feel tanky.
[381:30.75]I feel annoying.
[381:33.29]No.
[381:34.83]No, my character just feels annoying.
[381:37.78]In like a good way.
[381:39.84]Oh, okay.
[381:40.69]There's another orb over here where I am that spawned near me for some reason.
[381:44.75]I think because we killed two bosses here.
[381:47.46]Yeah, and I need to go get the Chimera one.
[381:50.88]Oh fuck yeah.
[381:55.08]My character was all pure and white and I'm covered in blood.
[382:02.29]Alright, the circle is going to be closing soon we.
[382:07.50]Making our way where downtown here.
[382:20.28]circle is currently coming in as we speak we should just go to one of those like uh castles in the middle yeah I don't know if no this castle right here yeah that's where I think my mark is that's a good one oh I think the library is up there we can market things accessories I don't think we're gonna have a lot of time for any of that it's already day two
[382:54.99]Alright, we, uh... What's the best way to get in here?
[383:04.48]Stupid castle.
[383:05.75]If it was easy to get into, it wouldn't be a castle.
[383:08.19]Oh, no, we did this.
[383:11.24]This is the virgin.
[383:12.62]Then let's go to the castle in the middle.
[383:17.83]Which I have marked.
[383:19.73]It's a perfect place.
[383:20.87]Plenty of time to do it.
[383:25.28]You want to go Sewer Boss?
[383:28.49]I love the Sewer Boss.
[383:29.63]I feel like they get me.
[383:33.59]Sewers.
[383:40.04]Stupid sexy Ned Flanders.
[383:41.91]We also probably kill the Crucible Knights really fast.
[383:45.05]We should do it.
[383:46.79]Did you say Ned Flanders?
[383:50.64]Yep.
[383:51.90]Well, hide idly idly.
[383:55.50]okay they give so much so sick okay down into the sewer
[384:26.55]these crabs are a mere distraction in our end goal our end gale I need a second to summon he will not be giving it to me
[384:59.66]magic he's a little stuck wrong button on that I don't know if that was a good idea he killed my boy that was not fair

[385:49.02]Yes.
[385:50.04]Purple.
[385:51.40]Power.
[385:53.81]Ooh.
[385:55.89]Bolt of Granisax.
[386:01.88]Anybody doing jump attacks?
[386:05.42]I am decently often.
[386:07.55]Because this is a shield and it's 12% more jump attack.
[386:13.27]Would you like it?
[386:15.19]Yeah.
[386:19.94]Take it.
[386:20.64]It's on the ground.
[386:21.14]We should go.
[386:21.52]We should go.
[386:29.21]Oh, God, we're going to die.
[386:31.23]Are we?
[386:32.19]Are we?
[386:32.69]No.
[386:36.31]Oh, shit, there's one right here.
[386:37.64]Ow.
[386:42.82]damn another 20k I ask this every time up here where is the lever to open oh no I remember no no I remember no I remember you don't have to tell me I remember that's so good I remember this time
[387:12.40]get this talisman upstairs and we probably gotta go there's no secret walls that's a good point I mean there might be I feel like that kind of would have to be right feels like some places have it I heard Miyazaki has a secret wall in his bathroom oh watch out
[387:58.01]Complete and total on Naya.
[388:00.18]Ooh, second one.
[388:01.36]Lined it up great for us.
[388:05.56]Nope.
[388:05.68]Gonna keep throwing rocks.
[388:12.03]This, yeah, this, okay.
[388:14.21]When you're not all playing melee, this just turns into madness.
[388:18.52]Hey, it's working.
[388:24.38]Ugh.
[388:26.89]is should I take the fp or this thing seems kind of crazy circle is coming in but slowly we may have time to kill like another Crucible Knight isn't there one more down here oh we got him already I guess let me go out the other way
[388:56.03]There's a treasure trust we didn't get.
[388:57.59]Wait.
[389:00.15]Yeah.
[389:19.91]Alright, we're in the right spot.
[389:22.28]We could probably kill a couple things.
[389:27.76]Kiss a couple of enemies.
[389:30.40]Seduce them.
[389:31.58]No, no, no, no, no, don't.
[389:32.82]How do I cancel?
[389:35.93]Dude, restart.
[389:37.29]I'm so dumb.
[389:38.97]I was trying to get mana.
[389:45.34]Every freaking time, dude.
[389:54.03]What?
[389:54.61]I can't.
[389:59.87]How much HP do you guys have?
[390:01.65]I have 1158.
[390:02.39]I have 560.
[390:06.76]So a lot.
[390:16.69]I think I'm going to get a level 12-er.
[390:27.99]Okay.
[390:34.02]Oh, you would die.
[390:45.58]Pulling mana.
[391:01.88]Trying to block.
[391:07.77]Oh, I don't have my doors out.
[391:10.30]Come on, block.
[391:14.22]Oh, big doink.
[391:15.40]Big doinks on this guy.
[391:18.97]Okay.
[391:21.95]Boss fight.
[391:30.18]Eat shit.
[391:32.01]Get up here and cast.
[391:40.85]Oh, I'm sorry.
[391:50.68]I'm so annoying.
[391:51.68]I'm sorry.
[391:53.28]You're fine.
[391:54.63]Oh, my God.
[391:55.13]That wouldn't be.
[392:01.56]Hey, I'm down.
[392:02.66]Right.
[392:03.46]Okay.
[392:04.00]I've only got a certain amount of I'll come.
[392:09.93]Oh, yeah.
[392:22.73]Whoops, didn't mean to press that.
[392:35.67]This is not even feeling like Elden Ring.
[392:41.78]It's a different game.
[392:43.24]Yeah, different game.
[392:43.99]It's called Elden Ring Night Rain, not Elden Ring.
[392:47.19]We got to keep the momentum rolling here because that's... Yeah.
[392:54.69]I got to take that oh I actually got one alright don't look don't let the cockiness and confidence build too much I think having a summon is going to distract one of the dogs and it's going to be very helpful if not more than one of the dogs
[393:23.80]You know what I'm saying?
[393:25.04]Can I get an Amen?
[393:27.07]Level 12-er.
[393:27.51]Alright, I definitely want a Level 12.
[393:33.25]And I'm getting two Warming Stones.
[393:39.54]Oh, I think I had to actually get a Smithing Stone for the first time.
[393:46.67]Oh yeah, I forgot that I had Bolt of Granisax.
[393:48.88]Oh, I forgot the level.
[393:51.26]I got tons of FP.
[393:53.86]I wonder if I can Bewitching Branch one of the dogs.
[393:57.03]That'd be insane if I could.
[393:58.35]I just missed a level.
[394:10.95]Oh, apparently my ultimate can res people that are full downed with like full circles.
[394:22.26]You look cool.
[394:24.12]That's what I'm saying.
[394:24.70]I look like I'm from a different game.
[394:27.40]She has like her own unique attack claw.
[394:32.23]That's cool.
[394:32.93]That was cool.
[394:39.10]Alright, this is the one.
[394:39.96]We're going to do it right now.
[394:40.98]This is a big one.
[394:42.11]We're going to finally beat the three-headed dog.
[394:46.05]No.
[394:48.26]He is.
[394:48.42]He is.
[394:50.54]I'm skipping.
[394:51.56]I've seen this fridge.
[394:52.18]Use your cooldowns effectively.
[394:55.33]Do it well.
[394:56.13]Ahhh!
[395:14.09]Fuck.
[395:14.53]I tried to dodge it.
[395:15.27]That was dumb.
[395:21.27]What?
[395:28.30]I don't know what I just did.
[395:30.23]What am I doing?
[395:31.73]I don't know, but you're doing it.
[395:33.20]He came to it.
[395:55.42]Dude, stop that attack.
[395:58.57]Delete it.
[395:59.79]Delete that attack.
[396:04.78]Oh, fuck.
[396:07.34]No!
[396:07.94]Not again.
[396:08.48]Fuck you, dude.
[396:10.04]I'm trying to get aggro.
[396:13.97]I'll do the pillar move.
[396:14.71]I'll do the pillar move.
[396:17.43]Let me get close.
[396:20.38]I'm trying to get big skeleton for big aggro.
[396:23.44]I'll put the pillar.
[396:24.06]Let me get safe up here.
[396:26.76]Can you just double jump up it?
[396:28.76]Yeah.
[396:33.85]I feel like this is the least safe location right now.
[396:37.32]Sorry.
[396:38.16]I'm sorry.
[396:39.06]Does it actually hurt you?
[396:44.82]Oh, I fell at the worst possible time.
[396:49.93]I'm taking my time, man.
[396:51.23]I tried it.
[396:51.73]It didn't work.
[397:03.01]Combining.
[397:04.45]Alright, we're good.
[397:10.68]Shit!
[397:14.65]I think we got them, dudes.
[397:15.83]We're good.
[397:16.25]Everybody chill.
[397:18.11]Kneeling.
[397:18.99]The seed on the floor.
[397:22.42]Warming stone.
[397:47.14]Oh yeah.
[397:51.16]Split, split, split.
[398:00.69]All my minions are dead.
[398:04.91]But I want to save my ult for if you guys go down.
[398:07.12]I'm just playing real safe.
[398:10.06]I'm going to drop another warming stone on me.
[398:12.54]I'm about to go down.
[398:13.90]I'm getting fucking smashed.
[398:17.63]I'm okay.
[398:21.51]Where are you?
[398:23.14]I'm coming to you.
[398:24.70]I'm down.
[398:24.90]They're coming at you, they're coming at you.
[398:25.92]I'm down, I'm down.
[398:26.32]All the res, all the res.
[398:33.91]Nice.
[398:36.81]Oh, that was fucking really shitty.
[398:44.62]Alright, let's do it.
[398:54.54]Are you guys out of heals?
[398:55.76]Yep.
[398:56.92]I have one.
[398:57.76]Oh my god.
[398:57.98]I have a warm rain stone.
[398:58.56]I can put it on the floor.
[398:59.18]Uh, no, you're good.
[399:01.31]I just am asking because I have a heal spell.
[399:07.66]This is it.
[399:13.99]Oh, fuck!
[399:17.53]That was such a shitty spawn.
[399:20.60]Just stay alive.
[399:29.60]Oh, he's split.
[399:31.44]I'm gonna ult, I think.
[399:34.67]Yeah, I'm ulting.
[399:38.15]Oh, nice!
[399:41.27]I'm gonna ult too, fuck!
[399:47.84]Kill it!

[400:15.07]Cool did it.
[400:20.86]So that.
[400:24.47]I feel like we deserve a cut scene.
[400:29.81]dude feeling really let down right now got some cool runes oh stamina recovers with each successful attack yeah it's big I like that yeah I feel like stamina is so bad right now for everybody cool cutscene after that cut we got it are you serious we earned this yeah everybody quiet
[400:58.62]Start chewing ice.
[401:05.89]The night has been vanquished.
[401:12.61]After an age of struggle.
[401:18.24]This is a fine achievement for which I am grateful.
[401:25.35]Indeed a promising first step.
[401:36.37]She got that stank hand.

[402:30.15]Oh.
[402:34.63]Shifting Earth.
[402:35.89]There's like a lot more bosses now.
[402:40.10]Yeah.
[402:41.24]They also told me to go to bed.
[402:46.97]How come this one is purple?
[402:50.73]One of these is purple.
[402:53.64]We should get a doctor to look at that.
[403:02.28]Alright, that was good.
[403:03.68]I like that.
[403:09.61]Like I'm looking down at my ball sack right now.
[403:11.69]Right now?
[403:13.09]Hey guys, I don't know.
[403:14.68]One of these is purple.
[403:16.66]What are you talking about?
[403:17.50]What else would it be?
[403:18.32]One of these is purple?
[403:19.40]What would it be besides that?
[403:21.50]Finger?
[403:23.01]Toe?
[403:26.81]Alright, true.
[403:31.47]wait I've unlocked a new relic right what does that mean maybe an extra slot I don't know that's what I'm thinking alright guys I I think I'm gonna have to call it here no you do one more because the Earth just shifted oh okay fine you have to alright fine we'll do one we gotta see the new content that's true you're right you're right you're right you're right you're right you're right let me take a break I'll be back
[403:59.50]Oh, fucking grandpa.
[404:01.38]I'll be right back.
[404:02.83]I have to take a short break.
[404:05.03]This is going to be the last one, though.
[404:10.10]Whatever it is.
[404:10.52]Yeah.
[404:11.42]Yeah, it is late.
[404:12.37]I usually am.
[404:14.05]Yeah.
[404:14.55]Yeah, it's late.
[404:15.27]Okay, beer be.
[408:24.56]I feel that.
[408:26.06]You know?
[408:27.18]Or something else.
[408:27.68]You guys giving your thoughts?
[408:29.90]Yeah, we're talking about some stuff.
[408:33.11]Just doing some thinking.
[408:38.39]Yeah, I don't know how you would ever play this game at that boss alone.
[408:46.66]I do believe it scales for solo.
[408:52.61]You know?
[408:54.01]Yeah.
[409:03.32]Yeah, I'm sure they'll do some balance patches to it.
[409:05.38]They already did one today, didn't they?
[409:08.77]Uh, did they?
[409:09.47]Yeah, they did it day one.
[409:12.15]I guess it was a day one patch.
[409:17.76]Some of these bosses are specific things, like the Gaping Jaw says only poison will kill it.
[409:22.59]Augur, I think, is stealth.
[409:29.78]I wonder if it's just you one, two, three, four down the row, or is it that they all the same difficulty, I wonder.
[409:40.45]Oh, because.
[409:41.07]It's weird that the second one is like only poison.
[409:50.80]So maybe it wants you to switch it up.
[409:57.54]Maybe, but you can't.
[409:59.70]unless you have a rune that gives you poison uh I haven't even looked at it yet oh there are a lot of them it just gives you everything you don't need poison but maybe just says it like yeah yeah I think it's just a weakness the gaping jaw sounds very cute to me what are we thinking and then we're going one more so Jerma can go to bed and I can go to bed and you can stay up all night I think play league yeah um
[410:29.47]playing league I don't know I don't sound it upsetting I know it's it's like drinking I'm just kidding I'm kidding I don't sure it's fun it's for her we're gonna fight the the frenzied madness goat okay we'll die trying oh this one's gonna do the the sanity you go crazy in your head pop mind sickness
[411:00.57]oh wait the trace of night what did we do with that oh I don't know I do yeah I think there's something we're missing unless that's just like a quest thing to let you know you beat one I think it's that
[411:34.21]Well, time to gamble.
[411:37.16]Also, they sell the new goblets.
[411:43.26]Why y'all not hit the ready button?
[411:45.43]Oh, shit.
[411:46.19]Because Jerma was pissing.
[411:47.79]No, no, no.
[411:48.11]I'm looking.
[411:48.71]We're waiting on this guy, Jerma.
[411:50.75]Oh, no.
[411:51.07]Take your time.
[411:52.30]No, do not apologize to him.
[411:55.28]Do not let him take his time.
[411:58.62]Dude, that's a pretty good one.
[411:59.76]Alright.
[412:00.06]I'm ready.
[412:00.58]I'm ready.
[412:02.41]Readying it up.
[412:03.73]So what are we doing?
[412:04.36]We're doing the next area.
[412:06.48]Frenzied Beast.
[412:07.68]Well, it gives us the option of a bunch of different bosses, and I picked the one that looked like a cool goat guy.
[412:12.25]Okay.
[412:14.33]And also, I took a nap in the bed, which I think reset the world.
[412:17.79]So, like, I think there's going to be new stuff in the world.
[412:21.56]I feel like you're a cool goat guy.
[412:24.88]I'm the goat?
[412:26.32]Yep.
[412:27.53]As in I'll eat anything?

[412:53.47]We'll all do it.
[412:58.10]I'm in my bed right now, guys.
[413:00.92]I'm not even trying at all.
[413:06.07]Dude, if I could lay down in a bed and have a big 70 inch screen TV on the ceiling, I would probably do it.
[413:18.62]But I would be so afraid that that thing would crash down and kill me at some point.
[413:28.63]Alright, where are we going?
[413:31.91]Go and look at these church spawns.

[423:51.72]Crazy.
[423:58.30]But I had this ant spur that I think I actually really want to use.
[424:06.45]We should probably move a little bit here.

[425:21.40]Yeah, I know.
[425:23.20]Okay.
[425:23.58]I know that.
[425:24.20]Just checking.

[426:39.11]Okay, goodbye.
[426:49.16]Level 10.
[426:53.53]What is the weapon art on the Sword of Milos again?
[426:55.29]Isn't it something crazy?
[426:57.61]Mikola's Black Blade or do you mean Milos?
[426:59.46]Milos.
[427:00.50]Milos is like a damage buff.
[427:03.12]It's really good, yeah.
[427:05.85]Fire over here.
[427:08.21]Oh, there's fire.
[427:17.24]Fire.
[427:22.05]This thing is disgusting.
[427:33.37]I'm sorry.
[427:33.95]I'm sorry.
[427:34.43]I just wouldn't hear that every day I came home from school.
[427:40.86]This thing is disgusting.
[427:42.42]It's just like a trigger for me.
[427:44.45]What are you talking about?
[427:59.97]oh did he really go away oh oh what the hell is he doing is he getting hurt he's outside the thing getting hurt oh I think he's scarlet rotted is what that is yeah it's scarlet rock for me I think the church was the strap man to see how many like flasks we have it's so much I didn't even get them all
[428:33.52]That was a quick turnaround.
[428:39.28]Dude, fuck off.
[429:01.26]Oh my fucking god, that was crazy!
[429:09.95]Dude, he's walking away!
[429:12.87]Stop!

[429:19.92]I missed.
[429:22.19]Oh.
[429:23.07]We're good, we're good.
[429:24.99]He's going for it again.

[430:33.02]Yeah, heal on a taxi is pretty great.
[430:35.69]We need to find a smith.
[430:39.13]Also, there are two more churches.
[430:41.64]We could get eight flasks.
[430:43.32]Let's get that church up there.
[430:46.11]Where is it?
[430:46.95]Oh, all the way up there.
[430:48.05]I think we go for it.
[430:48.91]I think it's just so good to get.
[431:02.83]Can't go wrong with extra help.
[431:05.39]Here's here's you and Poe could go for it.
[431:08.27]OK, I think I'm just going to kill shit so that we get like.
[431:12.28]An even spread of experience.
[431:14.80]OK, I feel like it's a long time for all three of us to go there.
[431:20.85]See if I can accomplish anything.
[431:25.27]They are right next to each other, thankfully.
[431:28.41]Yeah, I feel like this is the zone where we've done like most of this though.
[431:31.88]Also, Poke, be careful.
[431:32.89]There's going to be a super omega crazy boss riding our path here.
[431:39.13]Maybe hug the left?
[431:46.89]I don't know.
[431:47.77]I think we have to go.
[431:48.67]Oh, my.
[431:49.07]That's scary looking.
[431:55.74]Maybe go across that thing?
[431:58.01]I think we go across that thing and there's the scary guy I died oh no uh don't fight this either I think this thing threw a pot right next to itself I'm eating ass right now oh he fucking his he chopped my head off with his hip alright we're safe well that did not go well
[432:30.22]Oh, blacksmith over here too.
[432:31.80]Oh, nice.
[432:32.34]This guy's kind of beefy.
[432:39.59]I should have just went with you guys.
[432:49.02]That was kind of crazy.
[432:55.45]Alright.
[432:56.63]Did you upgrade your stuff poke?
[432:59.02]Yep.
[432:59.60]Nice.
[433:04.68]Buy a small pouch.
[433:05.58]I think it's worth it.
[433:08.92]Actually, yeah.
[433:10.09]I didn't realize it was equipment slots.
[433:22.46]Okay.
[433:22.64]The other one is behind us.
[433:26.35]Up there.
[433:28.51]We've got to find a way back up.
[433:30.33]Oh, there we go.
[433:33.36]Ster, you okay?
[433:34.80]Yeah, I'm checking out the new area that we have now.
[433:39.29]What the fuck?
[433:51.26]Oh, what the hell is that?
[433:53.00]The volcano is erupting.
[433:55.60]What does that mean?
[433:57.64]It seems to be shooting fire in all directions is what that means.
[434:03.61]Uh-oh.
[434:04.99]Take the spell one I dropped.
[434:07.65]The spell?
[434:10.06]Oh shit.
[434:14.46]I think the things I have are better.
[434:18.39]I can't pick it up.
[434:19.09]I need to catch back up to wherever you guys are.
[434:22.01]I am... I made bad decisions.
[434:25.34]Oh yeah, you're in the middle.
[434:32.76]Wait, is this even a church?
[434:33.85]Wait, it's not a church.
[434:40.24]Uh, it's this way.
[434:42.63]Church is right here.
[434:46.79]Should we go to the volcano?
[434:48.61]I think we get this.
[434:50.60]I was just there.
[434:51.62]I didn't see much other than a gargoyle that you could fight.
[434:56.86]Alright, well, Polk and I are pretty beefy.
[434:58.45]There's kind of a big area around it.
[435:03.21]Uh, well then I'm gonna go up to where you guys were at the church and... We gotta move anyways.
[435:09.34]We have to come to you, sir.
[435:11.68]Anywhere you want to go.
[435:16.63]Hey, chat.
[435:16.99]How you doing?
[435:19.15]Oh, you're streaming?
[435:20.97]Yeah, I was thinking about it.
[435:22.03]I was going to go live right now.
[435:33.33]Yeah, definitely.
[435:34.19]You can skedaddle over there and get the...
[435:38.23]I think because of the volcano situation, like, there's just a lot more chasms than there were before.
[435:43.97]It's hard to navigate.
[435:46.04]There's a giant hole in the middle of the map.
[435:52.12]I got it.
[435:57.81]Good.
[435:57.93]I mean, we could go to the castle.
[436:00.97]Oh, I found a key.
[436:01.86]A stone sword key.
[436:04.14]Does it ever go right under us, too, I think.
[436:06.85]We're getting closed in on, unfortunately.
[436:09.53]I see a red main up here in front of me.
[436:13.31]I'm going to start fighting it.
[436:15.60]Coming.
[436:22.22]Oh, my God.
[436:32.24]I see you're invisible.
[436:34.26]Yep.
[436:38.54]he hasn't been rotted let's get his ass oh he died this has not been going good for me on this day too
[437:09.59]Oh fuck, please turn camera.
[437:19.74]Coming.
[437:32.13]Careful of those lasers.
[437:34.28]Ow.
[437:36.22]I got hit by everyone.
[437:41.89]Oh my god, can I hit anything?
[437:51.66]Thank goodness, sorry.
[437:55.27]Great work.
[438:03.04]I like that.
[438:15.97]You want to go for the scary guy?
[438:18.96]Who's the scary guy?
[438:19.98]Oh, wait, that was the scary guy.
[438:21.32]Okay, never mind.
[438:25.66]You mean Santa Claus?
[438:27.02]We kill this right here.
[438:29.75]Right?
[438:30.59]I think that's what it was, yeah.
[438:33.57]Okay.
[438:34.17]Where are we going?
[438:37.13]This way.
[438:39.72]Yeah, I'm going to try and split up and see if I can... I'm dead.
[438:43.60]Haha.
[438:46.97]Ster, why are you away from the group?
[438:52.42]I don't know, why did I give you my legendary weapon?
[438:56.26]Neither one of us can even use it yet.
[439:07.07]What are you guys doing?
[439:08.87]Just pet into the middle.
[439:10.73]Down in the chasm.
[439:11.19]Did you drop down?
[439:12.13]Yeah, we're going to like... We should kill this guy.
[439:14.56]The gargoyle?
[439:18.60]I'd love to hit anything.
[439:22.02]I have no idea where you guys dropped down.
[439:26.07]We did it like right here.
[439:29.99]This is like a couple spots like here and here.
[439:37.52]Oh that fire fucking hurts.
[439:41.51]Oh shit.
[439:53.63]Oh fuck, the fire hurts.
[440:05.20]I don't know why I've decided to fight my own boss.
[440:08.93]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[440:10.77]I'm burnt.
[440:15.03]Poke, you are legendary.
[440:16.46]How are you not taking any fire damage?
[440:19.18]I'm not in the fire.

[441:07.42]How far are you going?
[441:08.30]I'm dead.
[441:09.69]Oh nice!
[441:11.61]He's right on top of you though, careful.
[441:19.73]Oh yeah, here we go.
[441:20.57]Good, good, good.
[441:24.78]Alright, this should be big.
[441:27.64]It is big.
[441:28.75]Oh, it's a lot.
[441:29.89]I'm coming for you.
[441:32.42]Big weapon.
[441:33.18]That's big.
[441:34.82]Oh, you can go all the way, like, underground.
[441:43.29]Nice.
[441:45.19]Okay, well, perfect.
[441:46.81]Ster, can you grab an item here, hopefully?
[441:49.66]I feel like mine's better, though.
[441:50.56]I just flew here.
[441:57.57]Yep.
[441:57.93]Hell yeah.
[441:58.94]Alright, I got the Maliketh Blade now.
[442:01.15]Are you sure you don't want this?
[442:04.13]Don't be mad at me if I get a couple of cool kills with it.
[442:08.34]The Maliketh Blade.
[442:10.64]You know you're good.
[442:13.79]Okay.
[442:15.45]We gotta go up.
[442:17.54]We gotta go up like now.
[442:18.98]We got a long way to go.
[442:22.10]Jump pad over here.
[442:34.28]Oh shit, we have to go fucking now.
[442:42.89]Yeah, we gotta go.
[442:46.51]Where did you guys even... I did the jump pad up this way.
[442:53.14]We're scattering.
[442:54.72]We're scattering.
[442:55.35]This is not good.
[442:57.49]I should be fine if I run this way.
[443:04.23]Brother.
[443:22.02]You good?
[443:24.81]No.
[443:35.64]I am definitely dead.
[443:41.26]Oh no.
[443:45.97]I gotta kill like two things and I'll get another level.
[443:54.38]What if I come... Oh.
[443:57.18]Yeah, my bad.
[443:57.92]I had no idea.
[444:01.47]It really just kind of jumped up on us.
[444:02.79]Level lost.
[444:07.38]I didn't have that many souls on me luckily I need stamina so bad the black blade of balaca
[444:36.32]I believe.
[444:43.83]Even though we haven't even seen the boss we're meant to fight, I'm still a believer.
[444:50.70]Poke and I have got some pretty good stats.
[444:54.33]Yeah, and my Mallet Cat's Blade.
[444:55.87]Yeah.
[445:02.38]Why would he do it?
[445:11.45]Uh, it's the first time I've landed up there.
[445:14.04]Oh, fuck.
[445:15.88]Oh, did I fuck it up?
[445:22.63]Oh, great.
[445:24.33]Oh, no, the two of them.
[445:25.49]I'm gonna... Get the fuck out of my way.
[445:28.96]I'm gonna die.
[445:29.68]I'm just gonna die.
[445:31.24]What if I just die?
[445:36.11]Uh, remember, they should revive each other if we don't kill them at the same time or some shit.
[445:40.07]Yeah, just do both.
[445:47.09]Okay, careful.
[445:50.10]Oh god.
[445:57.93]The hell is he doing?
[445:59.43]He's doing like player character stuff that we get to do now.
[446:04.06]It's not even that weird.
[446:05.64]Switch damage.
[446:08.20]I'm dead.
[446:09.18]Okay.
[446:13.13]Oh my god, this Gumby motherfucker.
[446:20.81]He's rolling.
[446:22.21]We got a roller.
[446:22.77]Who are we focusing?
[446:32.35]Skinny guy.
[446:35.23]We got to do damage on skinny guy.
[446:43.77]They might not even do it, but...
[446:48.37]The other one's gonna die from rot.
[446:49.49]Come on, come on, come on, come on, fuck!
[446:51.53]Ah, that was such dog shit.
[446:54.91]Kept getting hit out of it.
[446:57.83]Okay, he did not die from rot.
[447:02.68]We got a roller.
[447:04.92]Oh, no, no, we got a, we got a, we got a Donkey Kong!
[447:10.22]We gotta do damage to the smaller guy.
[447:16.55]Okay.
[447:18.45]I'm on smaller guy okay kill them both easy nice nice good job we just had we both had the exact same nice it sounded like an echo it was perfect
[447:45.17]yeah I got like three improved physical tech in a row like I'm I'm pretty strong probably just resistances I guess well let's see what it is this is it right yep good luck good luck everybody just be on your toes like wouldn't it be great if we first tried this and everyone would remember us for generations to come that would be pretty cool
[448:17.33]I'm only level 10.
[448:19.11]I feel like I goofed a lot.
[448:24.96]Well, I never got to use the anvil either.
[448:34.90]Ah, too bad.
[448:35.16]What do I even have for items right now?
[448:37.85]What?
[448:37.97]I just... Oh.
[448:50.79]Three warming stones.
[448:56.52]Oh.
[449:00.69]Can I get another item?
[449:04.62]Oh, shit, I can't.
[449:05.80]Fuck.
[449:10.18]Okay.
[449:10.30]Well, let's see.
[449:14.42]You guys ready to go?
[449:15.66]Wish us luck, everybody.
[449:17.26]This is going to be tricky.
[449:19.06]I'm not quite ready.
[449:20.73]Oh, we never used the stone sword?
[449:23.85]We didn't have time to.
[449:34.38]Give me one second.
[449:35.93]I think you should do this too, is camera speed up.
[449:40.25]I was thinking about that.
[449:41.33]Yeah.
[449:41.89]I've been thinking about it for a long time.
[449:45.42]yeah every time like someone gets behind me I feel like an actual tank oh I don't like it too high though because it really kind of whips around well especially how fast you run in this game it's true like it could not keep up oh same place so not used to it now though I gotta keep it yeah I think
[450:15.29]I went to 8.
[450:17.47]I went to 8, yeah.
[450:18.45]I think it's this little weirdo right here.
[450:22.16]Is it just this weird guy?
[450:25.85]Uh, yeah.
[450:27.15]Who's talking to me?
[450:31.58]Pick the right thing.
[450:33.19]Make your choice.
[450:35.45]I wish to have deep faith I desire a flask I want the power of a demon I refuse to make a deal I think we all can do this because I have I wish to have great dexterity a flask power of a demon or I refuse why do I feel like he's going to be stronger if you take a deal strength one yeah should we I wonder if this makes it harder alter self to gain proficiency with strength I'm doing it power of a demon
[451:06.87]Uh oh.
[451:08.22]What just happened to me?
[451:10.42]I refuse.
[451:10.62]I said I want a demon to help me.
[451:13.08]I lost health, I think.
[451:15.93]Oh shit, I'm gonna be building up madness.
[451:20.11]Oh no.
[451:25.72]That's cool.
[451:27.28]I don't do any damage.
[451:31.89]Libra!
[451:33.63]Poke!
[451:34.15]It's a Libra!
[451:36.61]What does that mean?
[451:41.95]Libra!
[451:44.40]Ow.
[451:44.50]Oh.
[451:44.76]I greeted for the scarlet rot.
[451:46.62]I'm down.
[451:55.33]What the fuck, dude?
[451:55.75]Oh, you need to get those things on the floor to save yourself.
[452:01.06]Oh my god, I went mad.
[452:04.20]Yeah, that's what killed me.
[452:06.71]I don't know what is going on over there.
[452:09.98]My rock move saves.
[452:15.06]I think I'm just going to dodge for a bit.
[452:19.79]What do we do?
[452:20.19]Run?
[452:20.43]I think I picked the most complicated boss.
[452:23.45]Break the portals.
[452:23.99]Break the portals.
[452:25.95]I think we've just shattered them.
[452:27.83]Nice.
[452:28.21]I think we're good.
[452:29.52]No, I think he's strong.
[452:38.34]I'm almost mad again.
[452:39.44]I'm dead, I'm dead.
[452:41.20]Okay, I got you.
[452:42.72]Oh, no I don't.
[452:50.43]Dude, what the fuck is this?
[452:52.25]How am I supposed to red you?
[452:53.73]We got him, we got him.
[452:57.28]He's dropping shards?
[452:59.34]Oh, these reduce your madness.
[453:02.50]Oh fuck, he's down, he's down.
[453:14.72]Oh, we're going absolutely mad.
[453:24.11]Uh, uh, thingies?
[453:25.98]Madness.
[453:26.76]I died.
[453:28.64]Oh, me too.
[453:30.34]Come.
[453:32.62]Oh, you just have to collect shit when he does that.
[453:40.60]Fuck.
[453:40.88]Alright, he's on me.
[453:42.52]He's on me.
[453:42.84]He's on me now.
[453:45.33]Oh.
[453:48.71]Uh-oh.
[453:57.57]Come on.
[453:59.19]I gotta get it.
[453:59.51]I gotta get you.
[454:00.61]Get out!
[454:01.59]Nice.
[454:03.09]Good shit.
[454:06.18]I'm throwing a warming stone down on the ground.
[454:08.32]Oh, you're right here.
[454:09.06]What else, what else, what else?
[454:10.38]Oh!
[454:11.37]You just run through them?
[454:12.73]Yeah.
[454:15.96]Uh-oh.
[454:18.06]Oh, you can see the shield up thing.
[454:26.43]I got madness and I rolled into it.
[454:28.60]Am I dead?
[454:28.94]No, I'm good.
[454:38.05]Okay.
[454:38.23]Oh, fuck.
[454:38.63]Mad.
[454:47.97]I'm crying.
[454:51.71]I'm crying on the inside.
[454:53.34]I don't think we can get you from the... It's going to be tricky.
[454:57.78]Oh, come on.
[454:59.97]That appeared like at the same amount of time as it took me to attack.
[455:03.19]We didn't do bad.
[455:04.09]No, we didn't.
[455:05.23]God damn it.
[455:06.66]That was so confusing.
[455:09.38]It's so hard.
[455:11.08]I think if somebody's got a full wheel, I think it's impossible to get you.
[455:18.82]if it's all the way up that's why that one character is crazy her ult revives you no matter what that was crazy that was fun yeah that was cool the bird guy ult also reses hell yeah what is this the flight one oh oh I guess that makes him really good
[455:49.01]surprised we even got to him honestly we got him to like 30 honestly yeah I had a pretty bad run all around and still yeah good he's one of those bosses where I feel like it would be very helpful to know the mechanics and we'd get them next time I think it's just the madness he does the yeah run around collect the madness negating orbs
[456:15.69]Cool.
[456:17.15]Alright, gamers.
[456:18.17]That was a lot of fun, but I need to eat food.
[456:20.83]I am very hungry.
[456:22.09]Same.
[456:22.39]It's very late.
[456:23.17]It was a very good, very fun game.
[456:25.30]Are you going to be playing tomorrow?
[456:26.94]I might be around tomorrow, which is only for a few hours, though.
[456:29.46]Depends.
[456:29.88]If not, then I will be rooting you guys on for sure.
[456:32.36]I'll be back on, like, Tuesday?
[456:35.37]Wednesday to play.
[456:37.15]Okay.
[456:37.65]Let me know.
[456:38.45]It was really fun.
[456:40.09]But if I'm not around tomorrow... Alright, see you guys.
[456:42.65]GG's.
[456:43.23]Bye.
[456:48.09]I think it's great.
[456:52.01]The game definitely could use some tweaking.
[456:54.68]I mean, I guess it's just, you know, get good.
[456:58.43]But it does feel like if somebody has a full wheel on the revive mechanic, they're kind of just a lost cause.
[457:06.65]Because all the bosses do so much shit.
[457:09.13]There's so much.
[457:11.39]Here comes three people.
[457:13.72]You really need one of the classes that can just revive.
[457:16.74]Or you just kind of have to leave them.
[457:21.95]But I guess that's why you be the bird.
[457:24.25]That's why you be the revive person or whatever.
[457:28.82]Keep a fast weapon then?
[457:30.80]That's true too.
[457:36.96]But that was great.
[457:38.70]I am very hungry.
[457:40.50]I give it a solid thumbs up.
[457:41.66]I think that was fantastic.
[457:42.78]I think the only negative to this game is what me and Ster ran into pretty early on.
[457:47.65]And that was... If you don't have three people...
[457:54.20]It's kind of like, oh, well, it's two of us and then some random person.
[457:58.57]And communicating with that person can... We didn't have, like, a huge problem with this, but... It really is designed for you to play with three people.
[458:05.58]In a call.
[458:06.96]Talking.
[458:07.56]Just going.
[458:10.21]I really do hope that they actually come out with a duo mode.
[458:13.19]If they just make it so you can just queue with two.
[458:15.99]I would be surprised if that actually does not get added in a future patch or something.
[458:20.26]But I really think it's necessary.
[458:22.10]I think it would be fun to do with two.
[458:26.42]but if it's one or three it's one or three and that's the way it is three is kind of an odd number because it feels like a lot of people have two and a lot of people have four so it's oh yeah me and my friend are gonna play it's it's usually three is not like a set perfect number that a lot of people do in multiplayer games
[458:54.50]But we'll see what they do.
[458:55.90]I think it's great, though.
[458:56.68]That was a lot of fun.
[458:57.26]I had a blast.
[459:00.02]I will continue playing it.
[459:01.00]You might see me live tomorrow pretty early.
[459:04.25]If not, I will let you know in the offline chat.
[459:08.41]Oh, my nerves are all up.
[459:11.31]I thought we were going to fucking do it.
[459:12.91]I thought we were going to get him first try.
[459:14.18]It was close, though.
[459:15.16]It was a good try.
[459:18.04]Alright.
[459:18.40]I'll see you guys later.
[459:19.34]Thanks for hanging out.
[459:19.98]Thanks for watching.
[459:22.10]And we'll see you again.
[459:22.98]If not tomorrow, then I'll be probably at some point early or mid next week.
[459:28.75]Also, the House Flipper Invitational is June 7th.
[459:31.43]So that is also next weekend.
[459:34.26]I'll be live.
[459:35.52]I'll be live playing this.
[459:37.52]Then we'll do a stream going over a bunch of House Flipper stuff.
[459:41.01]Then we'll do House Flipper.
[459:42.97]So whether that's, you know, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday, Friday, whatever it is.
[459:47.59]We'll see.
[459:48.56]But if I don't see you tomorrow, see you soon.
[459:51.75]Thanks for chilling out.
[459:58.50]And I'll see you soon.
[460:01.79]Call your mother.
[460:03.15]You know the deal.
[460:07.34]Hey, call your father too.
[460:09.42]Let's not forget that one.
[460:15.43]Have a good one.
[460:19.75]Oh, there's a lot of subs.
[460:21.93]I just looked over at the credits.
[460:23.11]There's like 16 pages.
[460:24.11]Holy shit.
[460:30.36]How many tuber screams did I do today?
[460:37.49]Was it too many?
[460:39.90]I had my ears plugged the whole time, so it was kind of like a vacuum cleaner going, so I couldn't tell how loud I was.
[460:44.62]Was I being loud?
[460:54.07]You did just enough.
[460:55.65]Alright.
[460:55.91]That's good.
[461:12.61]I'm curious how hard the last boss is.
[461:15.59]Cause they were Dan was nearly impossible that first run.
[461:23.82]Are they going to keep the trend of a new FromSoftware game comes out?
[461:27.63]The last boss has to be even more difficult than the last one.
[461:34.26]You're going to play Oblivion ever again?
[461:35.64]Oh, yeah.
[461:37.46]This is just the new hot game.
[461:40.35]Alright.
[461:40.63]See you soon.
[461:41.23]Take care.
[461:43.01]Libra was easier.
[461:43.85]Libra did feel easier.
[461:48.14]We'll see, though.
[461:48.92]We could have just gotten lucky.
[461:53.44]See you later.
[462:00.39]you
[462:35.26]you
