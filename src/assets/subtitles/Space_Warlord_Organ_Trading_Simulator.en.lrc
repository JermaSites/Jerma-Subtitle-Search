[00:01.80]Hey guys, how are you?
[00:02.98]What's up?
[00:03.24]How you doing?
[00:07.32]Hi, yeah, sorry I'm late.
[00:08.44]Yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:09.26]For those of you that were not in the pre-stream chat, and the reason why I am late, I got an emergency phone call.
[00:22.09]Nothing weird happened, nothing out of the ordinary.
[00:25.53]I had an emergency call.
[00:30.40]I had to take it, and it was, you know, I just had to make sure I took the call, and it was important about financial stuff, and I wanted to make sure I got my financial stuff in order, and a few things about, like, a recipe that I needed for my mother.
[00:46.67]I'm saying nothing weird happened or anything, but sorry about that.
[00:54.19]Yeah, I mean, it's like tax season and shit.
[00:55.55]Like, I'm just trying to make sure I, you know, cross all my T's and dot all my I's.
[00:59.78]You know what I'm saying?
[01:03.04]I absolutely did not do something incredibly disgusting and embarrassing.
[01:07.08]Well, yuck.
[01:08.76]Why would that happen?
[01:09.50]Like, clog your toilet with your massive pastrami sandwich shit you had yesterday.
[01:13.64]No way.
[01:14.90]That didn't happen at all.
[01:16.68]But frankly, it's revolting that you're saying it.
[01:23.89]Like, why would that happen?
[01:25.39]Like, you guys are disgusting.
[01:26.75]Do you see what people are writing?
[01:30.61]Look, those of you that joined us after pre-stream chat, look at how fucked up this community is.
[01:38.78]What are they talking about?
[01:39.94]Oh, look, Jerma the serial killer.
[01:42.32]Here we go again, right?
[01:43.50]I'm so sick of this.
[01:44.22]Whatever.
[01:47.30]Whatever.
[01:52.26]How you doing?
[01:54.49]Hope you had a good Christmas.
[01:55.23]Merry Christmas if I didn't see you.
[01:57.49]I did see you though.
[01:58.69]The day before Christmas.
[02:03.95]I had a great Christmas.
[02:05.01]It was good.
[02:07.57]I got a new wallet.
[02:10.21]It's nice.
[02:12.23]I got some bath stuff.
[02:13.81]Because I'm a big bath guy.
[02:14.87]You know me.
[02:21.09]Hey, thank you, Santa, for the five community subs.
[02:26.51]Wham, wham, wham, deal with it, entertainer.
[02:29.71]This is a boring title?
[02:35.37]What the hell?
[02:40.22]Can we peep the toilet?
[02:41.32]No, you can't.
[02:44.90]Boring title?
[02:46.26]I don't even know what the game is.
[02:47.30]I just, everyone told me to play it.
[02:49.42]It looks cool.
[02:51.62]It's got buying and trading, so you know I'm gonna like it.
[02:53.78]It was, it was Satan.
[02:56.68]Oh, thank you, Satan.
[03:04.03]Yeah, this is, this is called Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator.
[03:09.27]It's a game where you fly around the galaxy, and you buy and sell organs of aliens.
[03:18.47]It was recommended a bunch of times, like I said, and I am ready.
[03:22.51]I am ready to give it a try.
[03:25.75]Question is, are you?
[03:26.45]Alright, so... Let me turn this up just a tad.
[03:37.29]What's going on with my microphone here?
[03:38.91]What the heck?
[03:41.23]What's going on here?
[03:43.05]Here we go.
[03:48.02]Uh, you ever played RimWorld?
[03:49.45]No.
[03:49.95]It's too complicated for me.
[03:55.15]Looks like a fun game.
[03:56.01]Too complicated for my brain.
[04:00.29]Is that better?
[04:00.75]Can you guys hear me better now?
[04:03.09]Alright, I'm gonna do some tests for you.
[04:05.19]So you tell me if this is too much or too little.
[04:07.29]Ready?
[04:09.19]Too loud?
[04:09.53]You want more?
[04:25.57]Better?
[04:25.77]How's this?
[04:28.72]Is this better?
[04:29.40]This one good?
[04:33.36]What if I scream though?
[04:34.34]Like I'm gonna turn it down?
[04:39.38]Better?
[04:39.60]Trying to get my audio settings better.
[04:47.52]More?
[04:48.46]Is that better?
[04:48.88]Perfect?
[04:52.21]Alright.
[04:52.45]Let's just go.
[04:52.85]Sounds good?
[04:56.23]Okay.
[04:57.61]Maybe do a little more?
[04:58.39]We'll see.
[05:03.02]This is Oregon Trader Simulator.
[05:08.24]I'm very curious.
[05:14.29]Was my FPS weird?
[05:15.13]23 hertz?
[05:20.07]Wait, wait.
[05:21.51]What?
[05:22.03]What do you mean 23 hertz?
[05:24.55]Is this a fucking CRT TV on an iMac from like 1995?
[05:29.22]Why does it look like this?
[05:31.52]What's happening?
[05:39.72]How can you even do 23 Hz?
[05:40.70]That's crazy.
[05:41.94]It's because it's cinematic?
[05:44.36]Oh, I see.
[05:50.01]Alright, 144 Hz at 1440p.
[05:55.33]I actually hate selecting this.
[05:56.79]I am one of those old boomer people that really does... I like 1080p.
[06:01.69]I don't want 1440p.
[06:03.31]I don't want 2560.
[06:03.79]It's too high.
[06:11.75]Uh, text effect wiggle?
[06:13.87]No.
[06:14.37]I'll puke.
[06:16.75]Music's alright.
[06:17.35]Alright, I'm gonna apply.
[06:18.81]Hopefully the screen doesn't crash.
[06:22.01]Ooh, look at how much better that is.
[06:26.48]No wiggle?
[06:27.10]No, no, no wiggling.
[06:28.18]No.
[06:28.82]I don't like when shit moves around.
[06:29.74]What is this, full screen?
[06:32.82]Okay, that's fine.
[06:34.70]Are you ready?
[06:36.61]I'm not turning the wiggle on.
[06:38.71]The wiggle's not going on.
[06:41.93]Set the stream to 1080.
[06:42.97]I'm not... Alright, we're gonna go.
[06:49.85]I'm actually, I'm very curious about this game.
[06:51.16]Where are you guys?
[06:54.30]There you are.
[06:57.12]Uh, thank you, thanks to Usually Zane, Mystic Quests, and an anonymous gifter for the 5-5-10-5 community sub.
[07:03.12]Alright, I'm ready, let's go.
[07:08.19]Great new game.
[07:09.53]Who are you?
[07:10.47]Dog.
[07:11.41]No.
[07:12.47]Dog with a hat on.
[07:13.99]Wait.
[07:18.65]What the fuck?
[07:24.34]The mage from Final Fantasy.
[07:27.28]Sus.
[07:29.42]Frog.
[07:30.48]Frog.
[07:32.34]The guy from that Netflix show with the super-powered people.
[07:35.62]They live in a mansion together.
[07:40.97]Devil Knight.
[07:43.11]The new Ice Cube thing that people do on Twitch right now.
[07:48.37]Spider-Man.
[07:50.33]Peter Parker.
[07:50.81]This guy.
[08:00.16]I don't think you understand your position.
[08:03.78]I cannot touch you.
[08:06.77]You are an organ trader, a supplier of meaty demand with a moral flexibility ranging in the parsecs.
[08:15.00]You buy organs, you sell organs, you take on client requests and fulfill them and use their money to fuel your future.
[08:24.26]Why is this person talking like me?
[08:26.00]I type like this.
[08:28.87]This is how I talk in chat.
[08:32.20]You buy, you fulfill them and use their money to fuel your future.
[08:36.58]I don't know, I like emphasizing words.
[08:43.06]You will not lose money fulfilling a request unless you want to.
[08:48.78]You cannot be held accountable for your actions.
[08:51.04]Everyone has organs.
[08:52.91]Everyone wants organs and everyone needs organs.
[08:56.25]Which means they need you.
[08:59.87]This is an angry YouTube comment.
[09:05.12]They need us.
[09:08.42]Okay.
[09:09.92]So, congratulations.
[09:11.52]The universe is your fleshy, parasitic playground.
[09:15.15]Everyone else just lives in it.
[09:16.41]Can you stall?
[09:18.71]What do you mean can I stall?
[09:20.57]It's 4.30.
[09:21.29]I was supposed to start a half an hour ago.
[09:26.94]Don't worry.
[09:27.30]You don't have to turn the laundry over.
[09:29.05]You can leave the laundry in the washing machine for at least like 30 to 40 minutes.
[09:33.53]Anything over an hour or two, that's bad.
[09:35.39]You're going to have to rewash.
[09:36.69]Just saying.
[09:40.79]Controls.
[09:41.27]Scroll and then left and right.
[09:42.76]Okay.
[09:46.40]Oh, shit.
[09:47.74]Okay.
[09:47.90]I have $2,300.
[09:48.30]Height, size, trade.
[09:53.16]So I got this.
[09:53.92]Oh, cargo and holds.
[09:57.71]Personal?
[09:59.23]Holds.
[09:59.53]I like to click.
[10:00.07]I'm slow.
[10:01.69]Okay.
[10:02.03]Q and E. I don't like it.
[10:02.83]It's too fast.
[10:03.23]I feel like I'm playing Starcraft.
[10:05.54]Okay.
[10:05.82]So, holds.
[10:06.56]Where am I?
[10:07.36]What's my favorite organ?
[10:08.18]The, uh... Spleen.
[10:14.01]So day zero, personal.
[10:16.63]Title, scum.
[10:18.07]Current face, this.
[10:19.81]2,300 credits.
[10:21.15]Reputation progression, reputation credits, stock portfolio.
[10:24.11]So you trade stocks.
[10:26.27]Organs touched.
[10:27.92]Intestines owned in meters.
[10:31.52]Breaths taken?
[10:32.52]What the fuck is this?
[10:34.86]Alright.
[10:36.86]So this is just like my personal little card here.
[10:41.32]So this is what I'm holds.
[10:45.07]Oh, okay, so I can upgrade my ship.
[10:48.37]Close decay of all organs by 25%.
[10:49.65]Oh, I'm going to be into this game.
[10:51.47]Let's see, wait.
[10:52.23]Okay, cargo.
[10:53.86]Okay, I only have, what, five slots?
[10:59.26]Six slots?
[11:00.78]Don't breathe for two minutes and see what happens.
[11:02.34]Don't ever fucking don't breathe for two minutes.
[11:04.54]Breathe.
[11:06.17]Don't play these dumb games.
[11:07.91]No.
[11:08.11]Fulfill.
[11:12.42]Audio log?
[11:13.56]Is this a guitar?
[11:14.46]What does a guitar want with an organ?
[11:19.09]Or is this just the annoying guy that I call that plays this first and then says hello?
[11:29.71]Okay, here we go.
[11:30.77]Alright, what about trade?
[11:31.82]Can I trade?
[11:32.78]How do I know what people want?
[11:33.76]Should I go trade?
[11:36.20]Trade.
[11:36.86]The market is open.
[11:37.52]What?
[11:37.62]What do you mean the market's open?
[11:39.44]Buy?
[11:39.72]What is this?
[11:42.96]This is a liver.
[11:43.62]It's a large liver.
[11:44.56]It's a 46 blood type B+.
[11:46.03]Wait, wait, wait.

[11:48.57]Hello, scum.
[11:51.01]Uh... Hello.
[11:52.55]Right now, you're nothing.
[11:53.57]They wouldn't trust you to trade shoes.
[11:55.19]And we're going to fix that.
[11:56.13]Get me a stomach and make something yourself.
[11:57.85]I only have two minutes?
[11:59.73]Alright, I'll get you a stomach.
[12:02.35]Buy a stomach.
[12:04.59]Is this a heart?
[12:06.23]Liver?
[12:07.61]Heart?
[12:08.67]Heart?
[12:09.47]Liver?
[12:10.19]There are no stomachs!
[12:13.41]Stomach!
[12:14.05]Alright, blood type AB, rarity mythic.

[12:46.56]This guy's got $5,000.
[12:47.10]I want cold companions.
[12:52.25]In high gravity on cold nights, I like to clutch a warm lung between my fingers.
[12:56.03]I need another one for a friend.
[12:57.47]Alright, you want a warm lung?
[12:58.53]What do you want?
[13:00.68]I need an eyeball.
[13:01.46]Okay, lung and eyeball.
[13:04.46]There's too many people that want stuff.
[13:05.50]Alright.
[13:07.50]Can I filter?
[13:08.10]This is $4,300. $4,300.
[13:13.11]I don't have that kind of money.
[13:15.38]I've never done that.
[13:15.94]43, eyeball, right here.
[13:21.40]This one's common, buy it.
[13:24.44]I don't have enough to buy.
[13:25.34]Oh, right here, right here.

[13:48.91]Uh, what do you want?
[13:49.37]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:53.65]I want a heart.
[13:54.31]Now give me a heart above 74.
[13:55.84]I got 10 seconds.
[14:04.08]Oh!

[14:05.24]What?
[14:10.44]What the hell?
[14:11.84]I got scammed?
[14:14.68]You gotta go quick.
[14:15.30]Okay, what about... This is day one.
[14:20.23]Do I have any?
[14:23.33]Oh, I don't have to sell it immediately.
[14:25.15]I can just buy it.
[14:25.89]The condition was wrong.
[14:27.93]Oh.
[14:31.21]Oh, okay, so my reputation.
[14:32.53]Enabled eternal war effort.
[14:34.02]What?
[14:34.18]What?
[14:37.52]It was 90, though.
[14:38.52]Yeah, I thought it was high.
[14:40.29]You scammed them.
[14:41.35]I did?
[14:47.67]My reputation's going kind of high.
[14:50.43]Alright, this is kind of cool.
[14:52.00]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[14:55.10]So can I do anything else with money?
[14:56.24]I just have to buy a bunch of shit.
[14:57.72]Can I... Can I... Filter?
[15:00.50]Or do I have to actually scroll?
[15:02.88]It was... Oh.
[15:04.87]You only got two minutes.
[15:05.47]It's too much pressure.
[15:10.37]High reputation, you're trash.
[15:11.43]It won't be for long.
[15:13.68]You just have to scroll.
[15:14.44]Alright.
[15:14.68]25 gram, what does this get me?
[15:19.56]A refrigeration unit welded onto the space a cargo hold should occupy, and miraculously it works.
[15:26.91]You don't have to do requests.
[15:29.89]Really?
[15:30.07]I'm gonna go for it again.
[15:32.59]Let's go.

[15:42.28]Warlord Orbis always wants to greet new traders with a gift.
[15:46.42]Says it helps grease the wheels for everyone.
[15:48.24]Would a mythic heart be useful?
[15:50.09]Uh... Yeah?
[15:54.81]Can I sell it?
[16:03.33]Alright.
[16:04.11]Small.
[16:04.93]Condition 68.

[16:07.19]Mythic.
[16:08.97]I can sell this for 2500 bucks right now.
[16:11.39]No.
[16:11.91]I'm holding it.
[16:13.00]Alright, alright, alright.
[16:13.50]What do people want?
[16:14.02]What do you want?
[16:17.10]You want a... I want a stomach.
[16:18.66]I don't think about the Thunder of the War Harvester.
[16:20.48]I just want a stomach.
[16:21.22]Alright, you want a stomach?
[16:21.92]I'll get you a cheap stomach.
[16:24.22]Stomach.
[16:24.52]It's a liver.
[16:27.10]Stomach.
[16:28.21]How much was he going to pay me?
[16:29.01]I don't remember.
[16:29.77]Stomach.
[16:34.82]How much was he going to get?
[16:35.46]Was this a bad idea?
[16:38.50]Yeah, okay.
[16:39.09]Got it.
[16:43.47]Wait, what?
[16:44.97]What happened?
[16:45.53]Oh, fulfill.
[16:46.13]Shit.
[16:47.51]Wait, what do you want?
[16:49.81]I need an eyeball.
[16:51.11]Fulfill that.
[16:51.63]I'm holding this.
[16:54.41]I'm not selling this yet.
[16:57.91]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[16:58.61]You're going to be $1,000 for...
[17:01.29]That's a warm heart.
[17:02.33]I want a heart.
[17:02.95]You're not getting the one that's in there.
[17:05.35]I gotta buy something cheap.
[17:06.33]Warm heart.
[17:09.81]No.
[17:12.41]No, eyeball.
[17:15.82]What the fuck?
[17:16.48]These are so expensive.
[17:19.00]This one's not bad.
[17:19.92]Alright, bye.
[17:20.28]This one's gonna be a thousand bucks.
[17:24.38]I made a hundred dollars on that.
[17:25.24]Made a couple hundred dollars on that.
[17:30.39]Can I see the chart on this?
[17:32.37]I want to see the chart.
[17:35.81]Maybe do I unlock a chart?
[17:37.43]The dev is in the chat.
[17:39.41]Going on, dev!
[17:43.84]I can do another quest.
[17:44.90]200, do you want me to give a... Did you give me a stomach?
[17:48.92]For 200 bucks?
[17:49.74]Bro.
[17:53.20]No, I need a cheap stomach.
[17:54.93]There we go.
[17:59.95]Oh!
[18:00.51]I ascended.
[18:01.49]I'm dubious.
[18:03.29]New organs unlocked.
[18:06.11]The dev in chat said you have to put a facecam on.
[18:07.62]I don't have any clothes on, so I can't.
[18:09.78]Maybe I should just buy something.
[18:12.36]Rarity rough, rarity common, condition.
[18:14.28]This is in such bad condition.
[18:15.28]Should I buy something?
[18:18.62]Um... Ooh.
[18:23.69]Alright.
[18:23.97]What's wrong?
[18:30.68]Alright, where will my car go?
[18:34.71]I lost a little bit on this.
[18:36.11]Why is it an excuse?
[18:37.75]I don't have clothes on.
[18:39.77]I'm not going to stream naked.
[18:40.95]Alright, I leveled up.
[18:47.35]Now I know why it's Q and E. Because this is a game where you have to go very fast.
[18:52.51]Oh god, this is going to be fucking horrible.
[18:58.29]We won't tell Twitch.
[19:01.44]Oh, by the way, I just want to make sure everyone's aware.
[19:06.55]The New Year's Eve voting is open.
[19:09.17]I'm going to give you a link.
[19:15.73]You can now go vote if you haven't already.
[19:20.93]I'm going to paste it.
[19:21.61]Actually, I think some of the mods probably have it already, but let's see.
[19:28.76]It is.
[19:29.08]I'll get it to you.
[19:31.09]This is going to take you a while, potentially, just to let you know.
[19:41.36]There are 26 categories this year.
[19:43.58]Now make sure you take a lot of time to understand and figure out which one of your favorite errands of the year it was.
[19:50.97]There were so many best and worst noises.
[19:56.30]We, you guys don't understand.
[19:59.12]The noise categories had to get split up into four plus, I think three or four of different categories.
[20:05.12]And then they had to get whittled down.
[20:06.32]There were like hundreds of best and worst noise nominees.
[20:11.03]Hundreds.
[20:13.59]Too many.
[20:16.93]Yeah, there is worst beater as well.
[20:18.73]I don't know.
[20:19.01]I just felt like putting it there.
[20:20.07]I didn't think anyone was going to nominate anything.
[20:21.43]I thought it would be funny.
[20:24.44]Oh yeah.
[20:25.16]That's going to close in a few days.
[20:26.52]You only have like four days to do that.
[20:29.16]If you do want to participate, that's only going to be open until probably the 30th at midnight, I would assume.
[20:33.26]Why are you naked?
[20:35.72]I'm comfortable.
[20:39.23]You say naked.
[20:40.05]I say comfortable.
[20:41.95]Is there a problem?
[20:45.23]Alright, let's go.
[20:51.31]I feel like I'm getting the hang of this.
[20:52.66]Traitors.
[20:53.24]Traitors.
[20:55.15]Bribemate has been installed.
[20:57.15]You can now buy favor and earn reputation from fellow traders, as well as pay them to stop trading for a day.
[21:03.17]What?
[21:05.65]I can pay other traders to stop trading?
[21:07.71]Who's this?
[21:13.82]Name the quartermaster.
[21:16.14]Goal, brains, hearts, and lungs.
[21:19.86]Resupplies the scant human colonies.
[21:21.80]Focuses on the bare essentials just in case.
[21:25.23]So this guy's buying all the brains, hearts, and lungs.
[21:27.25]So I can get rid of this guy.
[21:34.64]Favor?
[21:35.10]So what, I get reputation with this guy?
[21:39.52]Or I can just say, don't trade tomorrow.
[21:43.20]I'm not comfortable with that yet.
[21:47.49]I don't have enough money to make these weird moves.
[21:54.13]Alright, what else, what do I got?
[21:55.13]I still got this.
[21:56.99]Do I have any orders to fulfill?
[21:59.93]I don't.
[22:00.21]Alright, I'm ready, let's go.
[22:03.04]Turn it on.
[22:07.20]Yo, what?
[22:08.52]What?

[25:36.03]The condition gets worse over time.
[25:37.55]Oh, shit.
[25:38.03]Okay.

[25:42.25]Alright, I bought this for 70 bucks.
[25:46.00]I like this.
[25:48.46]This is fun.
[25:51.84]Market.
[25:52.66]Oh.
[25:54.34]Oh boy, oh boy.
[25:56.38]Okay.
[25:58.08]The heart index?
[26:05.36]Market in for ex-cormics?
[26:07.91]Liver index?
[26:10.64]Lung, the brain index is pretty, the brains are doing pretty good.

[26:19.44]Wait, I can, wait.
[26:21.08]Hold on a minute.
[26:21.72]I can buy, these are like ETFs?
[26:24.72]These are organ ETFs.
[26:28.10]So I can just buy, essentially, a weighted index of the hearts.
[26:33.07]I don't have to buy hearts.
[26:39.70]Okay.
[26:40.00]Because I can buy stock.
[26:44.14]Yeah, this is an ETF.
[26:45.08]Alright, what's cheap right now?
[26:50.30]Eyeballs.
[26:50.74]Okay, hold on.
[26:57.36]There's a lot.
[26:59.38]Alright, nothing looks like it's down or anything.
[27:02.36]Yeah, I'm not going to buy any of this shit.
[27:06.32]What do you got?
[27:06.70]What's wrong with you?
[27:10.38]Okay, yeah, if you don't know what an ETF is.
[27:11.98]So an ETF is, it's called an exchange-traded fund.
[27:16.17]What an ETF is, it's essentially like a big kind of colony of stocks in one ticker.
[27:22.03]So it rises and falls based on the performance of the stuff that the ETF owns.
[27:28.19]So let's say you talk about the S&P 500, right?
[27:30.22]The SPY.
[27:31.76]That's the weighted index of the top 500 companies in the United States by market value.
[27:40.01]I'm smart.
[27:40.61]I'm smart.
[27:41.23]I'm smart.
[27:41.77]I know what I'm talking about.
[27:43.36]Okay.
[27:51.04]So what that's saying is it's just like it's taking the average of all the hearts essentially.
[27:54.79]You are wrong.
[27:55.47]I'm smart.
[27:55.99]You're wrong.
[27:56.69]I'm smart.
[27:57.21]You're wrong.
[28:00.71]Excuse me.
[28:03.32]This guy right here lost a substantial amount of money betting against Beyond Meat a few years ago.
[28:09.56]I mean, I think I know what I'm talking about.
[28:10.88]Anyways.
[28:22.17]I don't like Jerma when he talks about smart stuff.
[28:24.97]No, I'm supposed to be just an idiot, right?
[28:27.97]I'm just a dumb guy.
[28:28.93]I don't know anything.
[28:29.51]I don't even know how to drive.
[28:31.03]I don't even know what state I'm in.
[28:36.94]I'm dumb idiot guy.
[28:41.84]I did clog the toilet today, though.
[28:43.82]That was embarrassing.
[28:46.15]He's like, I did two, whatever.
[28:51.94]I am pretty dumb, don't worry.
[28:55.62]But I'm smart where it counts.
[28:56.52]Okay?
[28:59.60]You go ahead and read your books.
[29:01.14]And you go ahead and read your books and get your A pluses.
[29:04.64]I don't care.
[29:05.54]I'm smart where it counts.
[29:06.34]I haven't read a book in 10 years.
[29:10.50]That's how you know I'm smart.
[29:11.72]Okay, I'm fucking dumb.
[29:13.40]Let's go.

[36:55.77]What do you want?
[37:00.81]Zero?
[37:02.57]I'll talk.
[37:02.99]I'll burn your life down so you owe me a mythic lung and I'm not paying shit.
[37:08.90]I knew who you are before the fancy office.
[37:11.28]What?
[37:11.48]Did I just tell him to fuck off?
[37:18.67]You exist on my mercy.
[37:20.51]What?
[37:21.79]Okay.
[37:23.41]Urgent opportunity.
[37:25.17]Everyone deserves to have organs, but for the powers that be benefit from fighting each other.
[37:27.95]I want a liver.
[37:29.24]No.
[37:30.28]Alright, I want... I...
[37:36.70]The first segment of an organ barcode is the organ's market number.
[37:39.78]Wait.
[37:41.58]Heart is 00.
[37:44.13]Know the number and you know the item.
[37:48.55]Oh, so I don't have to... Okay.
[37:52.37]Heart is 00.
[37:52.81]I can just memorize these.
[37:54.19]So 00 is heart.
[37:54.67]Alright.
[38:02.20]I need eyeball.

[38:11.43]Trade already.
[38:12.05]I'm going for it.
[38:14.45]Oh, okay, that's heart.
[38:15.59]I see what they're doing.
[38:18.26]So I can know exactly what- I don't even have to look at the icon.
[38:23.10]Wait!
[38:27.59]I gotta get rid of this shit.
[38:30.41]I'll keep one.

[38:43.23]What do you want?
[38:45.13]You want, uh, heart and eyeball.
[38:49.77]How much do you want to pay?
[38:50.97]That's too stressful!

[39:33.79]I don't want it.
[39:36.55]Stomach for under 100.
[39:39.36]Stomach for under 100.
[39:40.04]Dude, I'm sorry.
[39:43.74]I can't fulfill your request.
[39:46.58]What does this guy want?
[39:48.54]Mythic Lung.
[39:49.34]Alright, well I didn't do it.
[39:51.73]Explain calls and puts.
[39:53.97]No.
[39:54.67]No, I don't think so.
[40:03.08]This person's gonna burn my life down.
[40:04.50]Why?
[40:04.62]How does this game work?
[40:08.69]I'm walking my dog.
[40:09.51]Ah, it's fun.
[40:13.41]Alright.
[40:14.91]Alright.
[40:15.27]30 grand.
[40:21.78]Ooh, we have some more competition here.
[40:24.92]Woohoo, Charlie.
[40:27.66]Livers, bladders, and kidneys.
[40:32.73]If they're gonna buy the expensive stuff though, should I...
[41:01.38]Get favor with the rich emperor kid.
[41:04.52]I feel like I might get some gifts.
[41:14.80]So favor is... Okay, I got money.
[41:16.56]You have still brains, hearts, and lungs and you want rare stuff.
[41:24.50]Yellow requests are unique.
[41:27.76]Really?
[41:28.02]So woohoo Charlie is cool.
[41:33.07]It wants livers, bladders, and kidneys.
[41:34.35]I mean, should I get a bunch of favor?
[41:43.80]I'm going to try it.
[41:44.34]I got money.
[41:44.74]Let's see what happens.
[41:48.16]The requests, not the traders.
[41:50.70]Oh.
[41:51.98]Okay, I'm going to pay.
[41:54.46]Okay, here we go.
[42:00.71]What does that do?
[42:03.89]Did I just give the rich kid 10 grand for no reason?
[42:10.13]Why did I do that?
[42:16.81]Do the yellow requests.
[42:18.31]Okay.
[42:18.41]He's a top 100 streamer like you.
[42:34.01]Scammed yourself.
[42:37.59]You gave them gift subs.
[42:38.99]Alright, what should I do with this?
[42:44.45]I bought it for $2.16, and I lost money on it, but mark it, mark it, mark it.
[42:50.37]This didn't move.
[42:53.29]You know what?
[42:53.69]We're doubling down then.
[42:57.65]I'm doubling down on the X-Cormax.
[43:02.93]We're tripling down on the X-Cormics.
[43:05.39]I want 10 grand in X-Cormics.
[43:09.04]Just wait.
[43:09.74]This could be a shortage or something.
[43:11.28]Trust me.
[43:14.34]Alright, I still have this guy.
[43:15.26]I have to fulfill this.
[43:16.26]Let's go.
[43:19.91]This person's still here.
[43:20.77]Alright, if I... No.
[43:24.35]I have five days to do this one.
[43:27.30]Need another eyeball.
[43:28.54]Six days to get an eyeball.
[43:30.82]Bladder.
[43:31.20]Eye, bladder.
[43:33.92]Eye, bladder, liver.
[43:36.07]Eye, bladder, liver.
[43:37.01]They're cheap.
[43:39.07]Eye, bladder, liver, stomach.
[43:43.25]Eye, bladder, liver, stomach.
[43:44.79]Eye, bladder, liver, stomach.
[43:47.21]Already have one.
[43:48.87]I don't.
[43:49.15]Yeah, I do.
[43:49.47]Here.
[43:50.91]Eye, bladder, stomach, eye.
[43:53.53]Stomach, eye for less than 200.
[43:56.53]Stomach, eye.
[43:57.07]Bingo.
[43:57.39]Got it.
[43:57.57]Did I get it?
[44:00.09]Oh, that piece of shit.
[44:02.69]Bladder.
[44:03.48]Got it.
[44:04.38]Fuck!
[44:04.72]I can't.
[44:05.06]I'm too slow.
[44:06.24]I'm never going to make the raid.
[44:09.30]My DPS is going to be too low because I'm in competition with these idiots.
[44:13.29]Did I get it?
[44:13.73]I didn't even... What did I buy?
[44:15.57]What do you want?
[44:21.31]You want... Eyeball and a stomach.
[44:27.33]No!
[44:28.15]Stop it.
[44:28.57]Give me that!
[44:28.94]Eyeball.
[44:36.54]There we go.
[44:37.00]Oh my god.
[44:37.64]I have to compete with these idiots.
[44:43.05]This one's valuable.
[44:46.16]My DPS is too low.
[44:48.34]Second segment of an organ barcode is the organ size.
[44:52.08]D is tiny.
[44:53.14]C is small.
[44:54.06]B is average.
[44:54.74]A is large.
[44:55.54]S is gigantic.
[44:56.48]Oh, God damn it.
[44:57.92]Okay.
[44:59.64]So 0A is a huge heart.
[45:02.97]0S is a gigantic.
[45:04.15]No, 00.
[45:07.57]00S is big.
[45:08.67]00.
[45:09.01]Okay, so it's just grades.
[45:10.99]This is the size of the organ.
[45:16.17]So, for instance, if we go to the hearts, this is 00D, 00 heart.
[45:21.78]It's very small.
[45:22.64]This is a huge heart right here.
[45:24.02]You know what I mean?
[45:25.96]I think I need to drink a little fucking cup of coffee for this one.
[45:34.66]There's a B. Got it.
[45:36.22]That one was a pretty good one.
[45:38.31]There's a 10B.
[45:39.21]I guess.
[45:39.61]I don't know.
[45:39.97]Should I have it?
[45:40.41]What do you want?
[45:42.81]Live him.
[45:45.25]What does a liver look like?
[45:45.99]Kidney.
[45:54.49]Stomach.
[45:55.15]What is a liver?
[45:58.59]Devs tweeted about you?
[46:01.60]Oh, look at me!
[46:03.16]What is a liver?
[46:03.68]You guys know how big your liver actually is?
[46:09.82]How much you gonna pay me?
[46:10.56]I don't think that's worth it.
[46:15.46]Oh, alright.
[46:22.23]Oh, 20%.
[46:26.19]There it is.
[46:26.75]Two grand in the bank.
[46:27.91]I'm not selling it.
[46:29.01]I'm not selling it till at least it's at least a thousand.
[46:36.55]Alright.
[46:36.75]These are pretty valuable.
[46:37.71]Common, common mythic.
[46:39.41]I have a mythic eye.
[46:43.33]Zero two is liver.
[46:44.46]Okay.
[46:46.54]I'm going to have to memorize this, aren't I?
[46:48.33]It's going to be this thing to turn to papers, please, isn't it?
[46:53.61]Stop losing value.
[46:54.43]I buy some more.
[46:59.41]OK, anything else like crash?
[47:07.08]No, nothing.
[47:07.70]Everything's doing OK.
[47:18.70]I'm not selling it.
[47:23.48]You still need a liver.
[47:25.18]Liver is 0-2, you said.
[47:26.26]Okay, let's go.
[47:29.42]He's back again.
[47:31.90]Dude, like... Ooh.
[47:37.67]Soul.
[47:39.51]And I'm tired.
[47:40.09]You want just... I want a soul.
[47:42.75]Soul.
[47:44.35]Nerve cluster.
[47:45.07]Soul.
[47:47.37]Soul, nerve, cluster, and heart.
[47:51.75]Soul, nerve, cluster, and heart.
[47:53.71]Soul, nerve, cluster, heart.
[47:55.63]Soul, nerve, soul, that's too expensive.
[47:59.09]Got it.
[47:59.57]Fuck off, buddy.
[48:00.81]Liver!
[48:02.09]Wait, what?
[48:03.40]What is all this shit?
[48:04.10]Why do I have all these bladders?
[48:08.72]I sniped that guy so bad.
[48:09.88]Alright, uh, liver and I got new organs.
[48:18.68]Liver and, um, liver and... Wait.
[48:25.64]The third segment of an organ barcode is the organ's condition.
[48:28.49]If the barcode is... The condition is 60.
[48:33.47]Oh god.
[48:35.25]So it goes... Organ type.
[48:38.99]Size.
[48:40.21]Condition.
[48:42.87]Organ type.
[48:44.79]Size.
[48:45.51]Condition.
[48:48.30]This is too much for my fucking pea brain.

[48:53.36]Rotcane.
[48:54.10]Got it.
[48:55.94]Not a scam.
[48:57.40]This is a scam.
[48:58.31]I lie.
[48:58.79]Do not send me a heart.
[48:59.97]I cannot make amends for this failure of conscience.
[49:02.53]But I am so sorry.
[49:03.33]I deserve nothing in this world.
[49:04.57]Goodbye.
[49:04.91]I'll get it for you.
[49:06.33]Want a heart?
[49:13.99]Okay, now I need rock cane, nerve, liver.
[49:20.72]No way.
[49:21.20]Rock cane, nerve, liver, nerve.
[49:24.60]Rock cane, rock cane, rock cane, rock cane, rock cane, rock cane, nerve.
[49:27.84]That's too much.

[50:25.71]That was a good day.
[50:26.99]Still, I got 12 grand over here still.
[50:30.55]I'm fine.
[50:36.71]Maybe I should upgrade my, um... Should I sell some stock?
[50:40.32]Nah.
[50:40.92]No.
[50:43.29]Hey, a real life Devon chat here.
[50:45.73]I hacked Kinect support into this game before it launched.
[50:48.05]This is not a bit, though it is objectively funny.
[50:50.25]If you plug in a Kinect on PC and step in front of it, it'll work.
[50:54.07]What?
[50:55.77]What are you ta- Why?
[50:56.89]Why would you do that?
[51:03.75]I don't think that makes any sense.
[51:05.95]I need to get the Kinect drivers for the computer.
[51:08.63]I don't think that makes any sense.
[51:11.92]It's because it was funny.
[51:15.91]I don't even know where my Kinect is.
[51:18.01]I don't know.
[51:22.53]I have a feeling I'm going to plug that in and the Kinect's going to turn on.
[51:24.81]It's going to take a bunch of pictures of me sitting here naked.
[51:27.23]I don't know if I want to do that.
[51:34.63]I'll find it.
[51:35.83]Maybe later.
[51:36.39]I'm trading.
[51:38.01]I'm trading.
[51:38.49]I'm wheeling and dealing here.
[51:39.51]Give me a minute.
[51:41.47]Just do it.
[51:45.01]What if it crashes my stream?
[51:46.25]Alright, hold on.
[51:49.46]I have to put clothes on?
[51:54.38]Does it take pictures of you?
[51:56.22]I'm so concerned about this for no reason.
[51:57.86]Alright, this guy's Messy Marcus.
[52:01.46]He doesn't have any goals.
[52:02.88]A panicking, anxious, desperate wreck.
[52:05.37]If they could escape themselves, they would.
[52:09.01]Here, take $86 and fuck off.
[52:13.91]Ipe emperor gold star.
[52:16.11]No.
[52:22.92]Get dressed.
[52:25.26]What if it crashed my stream with like the SpongeBob text leaning down doing like the SpongeBob stance?
[52:33.78]I'm trying to- let me just get used to the game first.
[52:35.58]It hasn't even been like 40 minutes.
[52:40.84]It actually works.
[52:42.32]I promise I will plug in my Kinect, but not yet.
[52:47.49]Is the Kinect USB?
[52:49.39]God damn it.
[52:56.19]Alright.
[52:57.23]I'm not holding anything.

[59:06.43]It's fun.
[59:08.99]Okay, you know what?
[59:11.03]Leave.
[59:11.41]I don't want this.
[59:11.81]This guy is buying all the livers and all the kidneys.
[59:13.67]Go home.
[59:16.41]Messy Marcus is here again.
[59:18.03]You leave too.
[59:20.16]All of you leave.
[59:21.28]I don't care about hearts and lungs.
[59:22.40]Go fuck yourself.
[59:22.98]That was mean.
[59:25.00]I'm sorry.
[59:28.64]I need livers.
[59:29.44]I have to get rid of the people that are buying livers.
[59:31.18]Okay.
[59:50.33]Apologize to the quartermaster now.
[59:52.58]No, we're all rotten scumbags, okay?
[59:54.74]Look at, we're all, look what we're doing.
[60:00.01]Such a weird image, too.
[60:01.22]Okay.
[60:02.56]So let me get this right.
[60:03.38]I need a bunch of livers.
[60:05.10]I think I need three livers.
[60:08.36]And a kidney.
[60:08.88]And one has to be above 54.
[60:10.42]Go.
[60:17.95]No, come on.
[60:22.49]Uh... I'm not going to pay attention to any of that.
[60:24.29]I need livers.
[60:31.11]I need livers and one kidney.
[60:33.41]This is way too much money.
[60:37.97]Mm-mm.
[60:38.97]No one's buying it, so I can just sit there and depreciate.
[60:40.83]I don't care.
[60:44.33]Is one liver... Right?
[60:47.84]I need more than that.
[60:54.30]Come on, man.
[60:54.96]In the meantime... Heart.
[61:04.10]I need a 54 liver.
[61:08.20]Or a shitty heart.

[61:21.42]Bang.
[61:26.08]Uh, 54.
[61:26.74]That's so expensive.
[61:28.94]I'm gonna lose money on this.
[61:32.53]Alright, we'll take that.
[61:35.37]Now we need a heart, liver, and a kidney.
[61:39.63]Give me this.
[61:40.03]Okay, perfect.
[61:40.61]Got it.
[61:40.89]That was cheap.
[61:44.41]Get some more requests here.
[61:45.45]Act casual.
[61:51.31]There's a cloning lab.
[61:52.49]They figured out how to make organs, but they need materials.
[61:54.67]I don't have much, but please help me help the rest of us.
[61:57.94]One average lung, please.
[61:59.16]Alright, sure.
[62:01.99]What do you other idiots want?

[62:46.56]That was so expensive.
[62:56.56]Whatever.
[63:00.37]Go higher.
[63:00.95]I'm sick of waiting.
[63:05.43]And this is where we double down again.
[63:06.65]I have 4,000 shares of this X-Core mix ETF.
[63:18.50]It's just going to 50 bucks.
[63:27.38]Alright.
[63:29.69]You wanted a heart.
[63:30.31]Take it.
[63:33.05]You need to hedge your investment.
[63:37.48]Massive loss incoming.
[63:39.06]Now I understand why you lost everything on Beyond Meat.
[63:40.82]I didn't... Okay, let me... Let's be really clear.
[63:43.28]I didn't lose everything on Beyond Meat.
[63:45.51]I didn't lose everything.
[63:48.70]I traded with a little bit of money and lost that money.
[63:53.67]I didn't lose everything.
[63:55.17]I lost a small portion of what I would consider to be a small amount.
[64:01.81]Please, don't twist it.
[64:07.71]Alright, this is still doing okay.
[64:11.89]Notable traits.
[64:13.73]Successfully scammed.
[64:18.22]Alright, let's go.
[64:21.24]Chad Shakespeare.
[64:25.06]Always wants to buy high-condition organs.
[64:27.32]Decisive, eccentric, quick-witted, cajillionaire.
[64:30.40]Not a dog legally.
[64:34.12]Shit.
[64:37.90]Alright, I'll just... We'll do competition.
[64:39.48]Let's go.
[64:43.28]Ah, naughty creature, I know what you did.
[64:44.72]If you do not want everyone to know your big secret.
[64:46.34]What's with everybody wanting to know my big secrets, apparently?
[64:49.42]What are they talking about?
[64:50.25]Why is everybody trying to scam me?
[64:51.33]Send me a stomach and I'll compensate you 20 times over.
[64:58.88]Alright, liver.
[64:59.80]Heart.
[65:02.78]Heart.
[65:07.15]Ooh, it's this guy.
[65:08.33]You keep reading these messages, so I'm going to assume that you care.
[65:11.09]Thank you.
[65:11.57]Next, I need a shift wux.
[65:13.69]We can use these to grow or shrink raw organs as needed.
[65:16.72]Alright, shift wux.
[65:18.04]Alright, first of all, let's do this quick.
[65:24.42]This one is liver.
[65:27.54]Liver heart.

[66:05.68]Okay.
[66:13.08]I need a shiftwux.
[66:14.96]Can I just do this for this person?
[66:16.52]This person's gonna burn me down or something, whatever.
[66:19.08]Alright, we need more, more, more shiftwux.
[66:22.65]I saw shiftwux down here.
[66:23.63]$4,100.
[66:24.27]This better be worth it, dude.
[66:31.50]You need a liver.
[66:40.03]No livers.
[66:41.58]Lots of lungs, though.
[66:42.28]Maybe I should buy some of these.
[66:43.20]Alright, I'm going to hold these for a day or two.
[66:46.52]I'm buying this lung.
[66:48.88]And I'm buying this bladder.
[66:51.04]And I'm buying this liver.
[66:54.70]It's a shitty liver.
[66:55.42]It's B plus 51.
[66:56.63]No way.
[67:00.27]Large liver.
[67:00.85]19 condition.
[67:01.53]$600.
[67:01.63]Get out of here.
[67:02.49]Alright, I'm good.
[67:08.94]Yeah, fuck off.
[67:13.64]Alright.
[67:15.28]Alright, this is gonna be huge.
[67:16.82]Talented.
[67:18.45]I need to upgrade this ship.
[67:22.63]The more scams you accept, the more scams will be offered to you.
[67:31.19]Oh, it's Messy Marcus!
[67:32.43]It's not a hundred dollars, get out of here!
[67:37.06]Indecisive Ricky?
[67:42.74]Oh, I can handle it.
[67:43.98]But wait.
[67:44.34]Okay, I have a lung and I have a bladder.
[67:48.84]The bladder is really actually pretty valuable.
[67:51.94]Pretty good condition.
[67:52.64]It's small though.
[67:54.60]You're losing money?
[67:55.42]I am investing.
[67:56.90]I have... I have $24,000 in my portfolio right now.

[73:55.18]What do you mean changes them?
[73:56.60]Should I do that?
[74:04.10]I'm confused.
[74:04.40]What does that mean?
[74:05.04]Changes in size every day gets bigger?
[74:06.54]Alright, I have no money.

[85:35.56]Thank you.
[86:02.76]I got it.
[86:03.04]Alright, where's the dev expla- okay, you explain this to me right now, you're telling me that if I plug in- if I plug my Kinect in, into the USB, it's not- wha- like, it's impo- it has to be calibrated.
[86:18.24]Is this even the real dev or are we just getting fucked with?
[86:20.52]Is this a real person?
[86:21.94]Why did I go get my Kinect?
[86:23.14]This is- this is not even a real guy.
[86:24.62]This is not even the real guy!
[86:30.42]I think you guys just maybe go get a Kinect and plug it in.
[86:35.21]If I plug my Kinect into the computer, it's gonna be like, oh, I'm recognizing your Kinect.
[86:39.95]Let me fucking take over your computer and calibrate the system.
[86:43.33]It's real?
[86:45.43]I'll try this for five minutes.
[86:47.09]And then I'm moving on.
[86:47.81]I hope I don't break anything.
[86:53.54]It's real, it's real, it's real.
[86:54.78]Just plug it in, idiot.
[86:56.94]Alright, I'm gonna plug it in.
[86:59.04]Just give me a sec.
[87:13.24]The room's a fucking mess.
[87:16.38]Alright.
[87:18.18]I'm gonna plug it in.
[87:27.69]Hold on.
[87:31.15]Ooh!
[87:32.29]He's shaved.
[87:33.19]He's a different guy.
[87:34.09]Okay, hold on.
[87:44.31]Put it back, put it back.
[87:54.92]If I go like this.
[88:00.06]Okay, so.
[88:00.40]Does it work?
[88:03.86]Yes, it works.
[88:04.46]Star Wars pajama pants, alright?
[88:06.02]I'm not gonna go dressed for you.
[88:10.14]It's a miracle I put this on.
[88:11.92]It's a Christmas miracle I found a T-shirt.
[88:16.90]Little, like, tantrum.
[88:18.94]Okay, so, let me plug it in.
[88:21.41]Just to prove that this is not bullshit, Here- here's the- I'm about to plug the Kinect into the computer right now.
[88:31.95]It's going in.
[88:33.36]Here it goes.
[88:36.68]Are you- it's going- it's going in.
[88:37.70]This better not be bullshit!
[88:42.08]This better not be bullshit!
[89:17.43]This thing's too big.
[89:19.64]This is not a USB.
[89:21.78]What is this?
[89:24.78]This is not a USB.
[89:26.10]I can't plug this into my computer.
[89:30.71]What is this?
[89:31.55]Hold on.
[89:47.57]What the fuck is this thing?
[89:49.87]This doesn't plug into the USB slot.
[89:55.46]What's happening?
[89:55.98]Where's my mouse?
[89:58.66]My mouse is... My mouse is not even plugged in.
[90:02.50]I can't even use my computer now.
[90:05.34]I can't even use my computer.
[90:06.46]What the fuck?
[90:13.41]Is that an adapter?
[90:18.46]No, I don't.
[90:19.16]Oh my god, dude.
[90:24.09]I can't plug that in.
[90:24.93]I don't even... What connection even is this?
[90:31.21]What is that?
[90:39.12]Um... This is HDMI?
[90:45.10]This is not HDMI.
[90:47.45]This is almost like a data port.
[90:49.25]It's a fi- what is it?
[90:52.39]It has to go into DisplayPort.
[90:59.84]Uh, excuse me?
[91:01.36]I have to plug this into a DisplayPort?
[91:06.79]How is this gonna work?
[91:10.47]It's actually DisplayPort.
[91:17.52]On the back of the graphics card.
[91:19.33]I don't have any slots.
[91:20.47]I have three monitors.
[91:21.97]It's not a DisplayPort.
[91:22.93]It's called a D-Port.
[91:24.57]It's not DisplayPort.
[91:27.17]Do I have one of these on the back of my computer?
[91:31.84]You need the Microsoft OEM Connect Adapter for Windows.
[91:58.67]No, you don't.
[92:02.05]I need to pick a fucking flashlight.
[92:04.02]I need to see what's under here.
[92:06.98]Do I have that?
[92:13.44]Do I have that back here?
[92:19.88]I don't have that slot.
[92:21.14]That's not a real...
[92:31.35]I'm gonna freeze.
[92:44.45]Holy shit.
[92:49.41]Holy shit.
[92:50.69]That was, that was unbelievable.
[92:52.56]Alright, what do you, what do you want me to do?
[93:01.39]Do you have the Kinect 1.0, 2.0, or only the 2.0 has the USB?
[93:07.30]I bought this Xbox 360 used at like a garage sale.
[93:10.60]I don't know what this is.
[93:11.90]I don't know what version 2, 3, or 4.
[93:14.16]Alright.
[93:14.72]Alright.
[93:24.45]Well, it almost worked.
[93:29.96]Alright, that was fun.
[93:30.96]Let's go back to trading.
[93:37.70]Why am I so cringe?
[93:40.91]Uh... Because the alien fucking life force that came to me ten years ago told me he feeds off of the cringe and I'm the only thing that's keeping the planet from being destroyed.
[93:53.12]So you should say you're welcome.
[93:55.78]Doing my best.
[94:07.44]Alright, well, there we go.
[94:08.84]The connect, uh... That would have been fun.
[94:12.47]That's so stupid.
[94:22.72]You've ruined the mystery.
[94:23.92]Uh, you need the... The lung guy is how you progress the game.
[94:29.43]Alright, cool.
[94:30.01]Let's keep going.
[94:41.78]Okay.
[94:41.90]Uh, I got money.
[94:45.94]The market hasn't really gone up or down.
[94:48.02]So I think I'm alright.
[94:52.00]The dev just tweeted out that you're playing the game without clothes on.
[94:54.51]There's nothing inaccurate about that.
[94:57.91]I'm ready.
[95:05.78]Let's trade.
[95:07.02]And go.
[95:07.28]Let's get it.

[98:20.11]The fact that this is too late for Jerma's yearly award show is criminal.
[98:23.30]This entire Kinect bit is easily best joke that took over five minutes.
[98:27.36]You've given this man a mental breakdown.
[98:29.04]Is there actually no such thing as Kinect support for this game?
[98:32.82]Was that just like a 20 minute just- I just got had?
[98:37.42]He found his Kinect.
[98:46.15]It can't be real.

[99:18.90]FAQ, yes, we support Kinect.
[99:20.80]Does this game support Kinect?
[99:21.80]Yes, on PC only.
[99:23.42]If you plug in a Kinect 2.0 to your computer while the game is open, you can play through the entirety of the game using Kinect controls.
[99:28.50]Grab meat with your meat hands.
[99:30.18]Your body is the controller.
[99:31.18]We live in the future.
[99:31.88]Good luck.
[99:35.72]I guess I have the original, like, dog shit Kinect.
[99:38.36]The thing that uses, like, an orange display port.

[105:52.73]Damn.
[105:55.49]Why would it be $3,200 for a Common Lung?
[105:57.39]Give me a break.
[106:01.91]I don't... I don't think I'm gonna get it today.
[106:04.43]Spleen is gonna plummet.

[106:49.57]My stock portfolio.
[106:50.81]Maybe I should buy some more securities.
[106:55.21]You have to influence the stock market.
[106:59.45]Yeah, but I mean, what do you want to do?
[107:02.77]Wait a minute.
[107:03.91]Didn't they say that something was going to crash today, right?
[107:09.15]What was it?

[107:17.04]Nerves.
[107:17.54]Okay, where's Nerves?
[107:20.96]Nerve clusters are going to crash today.
[107:22.50]Alright, so when the nerve clusters clash, I'm going to buy a shitload of stock on the ETF.
[107:31.72]Why would people buy this?
[107:38.07]So tomorrow, remind me to come back here because we're buying.
[107:42.71]Buying the dip.

[108:13.87]Warlord Hardigan declares a temporary truce in all territories occupied by his armies.
[108:18.75]Oregon traders react in outrage.
[108:22.05]Oh my goodness gracious.
[108:23.29]The market just fucking tanked and I can just get a bunch of cheap shit here.
[108:27.31]I think I'm going to... Alright.

[109:17.44]I mean, they're not great, but these will go way higher tomorrow.
[109:20.89]I need a soul.
[109:25.01]Dude, somebody sell a soul to me, please.
[109:36.39]I'll take that.
[109:41.33]I know you're trying to make a profit, but if you help me and some friends undercut the price of nerve clusters, it would let me treat a lot of people.
[109:47.83]Oh.
[109:52.08]Sorry, I just bought like four of them.
[109:54.86]I'm sorry.

[110:15.94]Shards.
[110:16.78]Maybe I should buy a shard and hold on to it.
[110:25.03]Nobody's selling anything.
[110:26.59]What is this?
[110:26.91]I mean, see if I can get a heart.
[110:31.25]Heart or a soul.
[110:33.83]I'll take it.
[110:34.21]I didn't think at this point.
[110:36.43]No.

[148:30.71]Send me a shard.
[148:31.43]Alright, four souls and a shard.
[148:34.71]Go.
[148:40.69]Soul... I gotta stop taking the ones that are souls.
[148:44.56]Looked through my hunting traps and found a prime nerve cluster.
[148:46.98]2400.
[148:47.00]Sure, I'll take it.
[148:48.22]What does it look like?
[148:52.16]Ooh, I can already... 3500?
[148:53.02]I'll take it.
[148:53.44]Thank you.
[148:56.70]Alright, I need some more, uh... Alright.
[149:04.73]Do I already have any of these?
[149:05.57]I got this one already.
[149:07.53]Here's the soul.
[149:08.67]Thanks for the 4,000 bucks.
[149:13.01]Okay.
[149:14.81]Um... Go.
[149:15.21]I'll take that one too.
[149:16.69]And I'll take that one.

[149:27.79]Eye, Bladder, Bad Liver, Shard.
[149:31.55]Eye, Bladder.
[149:32.55]That's a cheap brain.
[149:33.93]Eye, Bladder, Bad Liver, Shard.
[149:38.35]Eye, Bladder, Bad Liver.
[149:40.15]Alright.

[150:05.11]What do you want for here?
[150:05.89]You want bladder?
[150:07.49]Fuck out of here.
[150:09.81]This is worth so much more money.
[150:12.57]Alright, now let's get a song here.
[150:14.07]Release something in my brain, I can remember what to do.
[150:17.78]Okay, stomach.

[151:07.30]Alright.
[151:10.24]Long.
[151:10.54]Oh.
[151:11.47]That's too slow.
[151:24.21]You need to pair them up.
[151:26.93]Yeah, I'm doing the song wrong.
[151:28.43]You're right.
[151:28.73]Somebody just got fucking banned, I think.
[151:32.28]I looked over and saw, hey man, first time chatter.
[151:34.30]I've been a long time viewer.
[151:36.12]I was wondering if you're ever going to play Among, and then I saw them get deleted.
[151:56.90]I don't know what you did, but apparently you're out of here.
[152:05.01]To answer your question, no, I'm never going to play Among Us unless it's Among Us VR and I'm going to play it for 10 minutes.
[152:09.93]And I'm going to smash my VR with a hammer.
[152:17.08]Alright. 60,000?
[152:22.99]Hey, Robo!
[152:23.93]Thanks for the 16 community subs.
[152:26.09]Why did I say 16?
[152:27.41]You gave 10.
[152:29.60]Where did that number come from?
[152:31.90]I really don't know.
[152:32.62]I'm serious.

[153:32.82]Brain.
[153:39.01]I need a new song.

[154:28.09]Nerve.
[154:29.77]Liver, soul.
[154:31.87]A mythic brain.
[154:33.17]Give it to me. 22,000.
[154:44.60]That guy just... I'm glad I did that quest.
[154:47.12]Whatever that was.

[155:05.98]Brain.
[155:11.26]Brain.
[155:13.63]Rotcane!
[155:14.45]It's expensive though.
[155:22.47]Oh, fuck.
[155:23.71]You.
[155:24.53]I know you want a brain.
[155:25.49]And I have it right now.
[155:28.75]Oh, okay.
[155:31.43]No longer broke?
[155:32.17]No, not anymore.
[155:32.83]Now I can invest a bunch of money into the stock market.
[155:35.11]I'm looking forward to it.
[155:36.53]Oh!
[155:36.87]Oh!
[155:37.27]Oh, look at that!

[155:38.71]It caps at six, Jerma.
[155:40.14]Oh, yeah?
[155:42.35]Time to cash out.
[155:43.83]Hell yeah.
[155:45.33]There's 45,000 more dollars.
[155:55.42]I got almost 100 Rin.
[155:56.12]It doesn't cap at 6.
[156:02.71]Ow, that's huge.
[156:03.53]I just had two big things happen there.
[156:10.39]Oh man, everything is all the way up here.
[156:13.05]I got to wait for it.
[156:13.97]This is going to be a pullback here.
[156:14.95]Do I just get the better one?
[156:20.11]Or do I hold on to the money and invest?
[156:22.79]What do you think?
[156:24.83]Because this will give me 14 spaces.
[156:38.60]Yeah.
[156:38.80]If I got the money, I'm gonna use it.
[156:40.76]Okay, so what... Okay, that's alright.
[156:43.48]What do I have in my cargo?
[156:44.36]I've got two livers.
[156:44.82]Somebody wants a shitty liver.
[157:07.59]I need lungs.

[157:30.88]I got money.
[157:36.62]Nerve.
[157:46.43]I need four souls.
[157:51.54]I'll get another one.
[157:55.36]I'll get another one.
[158:00.58]Lungs.
[158:00.96]Do I still need lungs?
[158:06.02]Nerve cluster.
[158:06.62]And I need... Okay.
[158:08.03]Boom.
[158:11.83]Hell yeah.
[158:12.75]I got new organs.
[158:15.31]11,000 bucks.
[158:15.59]Are you kidding me?
[158:19.00]If you mix a large shard into the soul, it would make them crop.
[158:23.30]Oh, a shard?
[158:24.38]You got it.
[158:27.84]Shard.
[158:28.20]Two shards.

[158:32.80]Two shards.
[158:33.34]Lungs.
[158:36.46]Heart.
[158:37.44]Two shards.
[158:39.84]I need a song.
[158:41.28]Let's get a good song here.
[158:43.94]Heart.
[158:45.65]Lungs.
[158:48.21]Heart, lung, shard, shard.
[158:53.35]Nerve.
[158:54.07]Heart, lung, shard, shard, nerve.
[158:56.49]Heart, lung, shard, shard.
[158:58.37]I don't know what's wrong with my brain.
[159:00.65]I forgot the whole thing.
[159:02.35]Heart.
[159:04.87]Heart, lung.
[159:06.89]Lung.
[159:09.25]Lung, shard.
[159:12.52]Lung, shard, shard, heart.
[159:14.86]Lung, shard, shard, heart, nerve.
[159:22.06]Let's do it.
[159:26.12]Shard, shard.
[159:29.19]Heart.
[159:29.81]Nerve.
[159:31.15]I think I have it already.
[159:31.93]Here we go.
[159:32.33]One of these was done.
[159:34.97]This one.
[159:38.19]This one too.
[159:39.06]Do I have?
[159:41.24]I got two hearts.
[159:44.86]Oh shit.
[159:45.86]I'm so slow.
[159:50.73]Market's still going crazy.
[159:51.71]Still at nine.
[160:02.81]Okay.
[160:07.07]Are you an organ donor?
[160:08.38]I'm an organ trader.
[160:09.20]I have to get rid of this.
[160:14.80]It's been here for too long.
[160:18.54]Arts are really useful though.
[160:21.02]If you get a new stock.
[160:21.98]Everything is just way too high.
[160:23.80]Look at the market.
[160:24.30]It's crazy.
[160:24.84]I need to wait like another few days.
[160:26.16]Everything's going wild.
[160:34.75]I need lungs and I need shards.
[160:40.61]Lung, shard.
[160:42.17]Lung and two shards and that's a shitload of money.
[160:49.68]Three shards.
[160:50.38]You're buying organs from a hunter of flesh cryptids and the organs are normal?
[160:56.50]That's an unlicensed harvester, idiot.
[160:58.44]He's hunting people.
[161:04.22]I literally have no idea what you just told me.
[161:06.87]Alright, I need a bunch of shards.
[161:08.55]Gotta get them cheap.
[161:10.69]That lung is is way too high.
[161:11.73]Dude, is this... Oh my god, look at the heart increase.
[161:16.91]Let's go.
[161:20.91]Alright, shards.
[161:27.94]I'm not seeing shards right now.
[161:33.50]Shards, lungs.
[161:35.62]Shards, lungs.
[161:40.35]Come on, man.
[161:41.51]Come on.
[161:47.69]Finally.
[161:48.01]That's 4,300 bucks.
[161:48.39]It better be worth it.
[161:51.02]It is.
[161:51.22]Soul, I'm going to buy it because it's cheap.
[162:02.21]Guards.
[162:02.59]If I get common, no.
[162:05.23]I'm going to buy a penis.
[162:12.65]I just realized I've been leaning forward this whole time.
[162:18.37]Anybody else need anything that I can get?
[162:22.69]More lungs.
[162:25.30]I'm so sorry.
[162:26.88]They found me.
[162:27.88]There's too much money in organs and they hurt me.
[162:30.96]Oh, oh god.
[162:31.90]I told them about the lab.
[162:33.82]Only send a gob letter if I'm worth saving.
[162:36.37]Yeah.
[162:38.27]Well, maybe tomorrow.
[162:42.39]I need shards.
[162:43.01]I got that lung.
[162:53.42]Alright, it's in a gallbladder.
[162:54.46]Just saw one.
[163:01.65]Alright, here.
[163:03.43]Take the gallbladder.
[163:04.64]Be saved.
[163:10.64]Mutual fabrication?
[163:12.98]You asked for something exceptional, and I think I know of a way to deliver.
[163:17.11]Send over an average shard when you get a chance.
[163:19.39]I've got some cutting to do.
[163:20.45]Alright.
[163:24.17]Oh, shit.
[163:28.56]Market's still at an all-time high.
[163:30.44]Come on.
[163:37.67]Still have the soul.
[163:41.85]This thing is, look at how good this is.
[163:43.47]It's a gigantic, valuable liver.
[163:45.92]And it's in pretty decent condition.
[163:51.04]Hang on, I gotta lean forward here.
[163:55.78]They found me.
[163:56.44]Send your credit card if I'm worth saving.
[163:58.16]I have money to spend, but I don't want to use it.
[164:07.53]Alright.. Average, we need shards.
[164:10.87]I just need a bunch of shards.
[164:14.74]I need a big leech lymph.
[164:18.84]And just shards, shards, shards, shards.
[164:22.76]Shards.
[164:23.26]Large shards.
[164:24.66]Give me shards.
[164:32.36]No.
[164:32.84]Shards.
[164:33.68]They're so valuable.
[164:34.70]Come on.
[164:35.37]Soul.
[164:36.65]I'm gonna hold on to the souls, though.
[164:39.75]Like,
[164:43.40]Okay, I do some organ harvesting.
[164:45.20]I'm meeting a demand of the marketplace.
[164:46.92]I take care of my family.
[164:48.08]Don't judge me.
[164:50.51]Whatever.
[164:52.27]I'm gonna get a bladder too.
[164:53.11]This always come up.
[164:53.85]Shard!
[164:55.83]Just bought insta-buy any shard I see.
[164:57.93]No matter what.
[165:06.00]He just wanted any shard, right?
[165:07.18]That's 11 grand.
[165:21.88]Okay, here we go.
[165:27.53]Send an average shard when you get a chance.
[165:29.83]Is that what I got?
[165:31.75]Oh, hell yeah.
[165:33.89]7,500 bucks.
[165:34.35]Look at the reputation I'm going to get for this.
[165:35.89]Are you kidding me?
[165:39.05]Holy... What did I do?
[165:52.77]Unwrapping the package from Breckridge, a pale ichor clings to your fingers.
[165:59.40]It's a painted canvas, wet to the touch.
[166:02.78]And in its muscular pulse, you recognize the form of Mentar Minter.
[166:07.99]It's really the horror.
[166:11.55]Centaur was dangerous.
[166:13.81]He was conniving and brilliant and petty and eternally striving for goals he would never allow himself to reach.
[166:25.87]We hope you assumed his best qualities and avoided his worst ones.
[166:35.13]It's no matter now.
[166:36.81]You hang Mentor's stylish, refurbished remains on the wall of your office.
[166:46.23]Mentor Minter is dead.
[166:47.35]His threats die with him.
[166:49.31]And if there's anything else you need to learn, well, he's always around.
[167:02.05]What?
[167:04.36]Wait, did I just win?
[167:06.60]Wait, what just happened?
[167:11.60]Did I just lose?
[167:19.14]I peeped the horror and died.
[167:21.26]I peeped the horror and lost.
[167:24.54]I think that's a bad end.
[167:27.88]Holy shit, what?
[167:35.65]Wow.
[167:41.67]There are endings?
[167:42.61]How many endings are in the game, I wonder?
[167:51.92]I concluded one of the storylines.
[167:55.86]Reputation points, organs touched, request fulfilled, your organs value.
[168:01.97]Okay.
[168:03.97]More endings await.
[168:08.62]Oh, okay.
[168:09.46]That's one of the endings.
[168:12.84]Oh, shit.
[168:18.30]Wait.
[168:20.10]I can just keep... Oh, wait.
[168:24.18]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[168:24.70]Wait a minute.
[168:26.78]You had a conclusive impact on this universe.
[168:28.60]Returning will permanently reverse that outcome.
[168:34.10]I kind of want to keep going.
[168:38.32]I don't think I want to start over.
[168:45.81]Yeah, let's go.
[168:50.09]I will lose that ending.
[168:51.09]Well, that's alright.
[168:51.81]What about the coin game update?
[168:58.68]Wait, there was a... What do you mean?
[168:59.94]You mean for real?
[169:00.48]There was a coin game update and it was real?
[169:07.45]Do they add a bunch of stuff?
[169:10.47]No, I'm going to keep going.
[169:12.00]This game's awesome.
[169:13.88]Yeah, I'm keeping going.
[169:14.80]This is fun.
[169:16.66]I'm not done with this yet.
[169:21.20]Market fucking tanked as well.
[169:22.36]Perfect.
[169:22.76]Wait, no it didn't.
[169:30.95]So where did I leave off?
[169:33.49]What was the last thing that happened?
[169:35.11]Okay, so this is just kind of the next day.
[169:38.14]Yeah, I'm having fun.
[169:42.68]It was a holiday update to Coin Game.
[169:45.14]Well, we'll see.
[169:45.68]I kind of want to play for a little bit longer.
[169:47.04]This game is actually really fun.
[169:50.31]This game is really good.
[169:51.47]Highly recommend.
[169:54.33]I want to keep buying stuff.
[169:55.75]It's just scratching itches in my brain.
[169:57.47]Alright, I got souls.
[170:00.58]What do I have to fulfill here?
[170:03.08]I need that gigantic leech.
[170:07.36]I need...
[170:09.56]Shard.
[170:12.10]Large shard.
[170:20.42]Uh, this is not the one I just did, right?
[170:21.66]No.
[170:22.52]I'm dying.
[170:22.96]I need a brain, right?
[170:23.84]Heart.
[170:24.10]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[170:28.73]What do I need?
[170:31.51]Uh, lung.
[170:34.27]Lung.
[170:36.08]Now we may speak privately.
[170:37.00]The Dark Emperor, Zimforth, has slept for far too long to breathe life back into this corpse.
[170:41.40]Gigantic lungs.
[170:42.80]Lungs, lungs.
[170:44.82]Bleach length.
[170:45.52]Shards.
[170:49.33]Shards.
[170:51.53]I need big lungs.
[170:55.33]Shards.
[171:02.80]Bleach length.
[171:04.94]I think I can fulfill one.
[171:05.80]Yeah, there you go.
[171:09.86]Hell yeah.
[171:11.15]Alright, I need a large, large shard.
[171:15.03]Gigantic lungs and lungs.
[171:22.19]Oh, damn it.
[171:22.89]I don't know what I bought.
[171:26.14]Large shard.
[171:26.84]Fuck, what do I have?
[171:31.26]Soul.
[171:31.48]I need a gigantic soul.
[171:34.68]Average lungs.
[171:35.26]I need big... Wait.
[171:36.14]Let me get this right.
[171:37.68]Got that one already.
[171:39.40]Gigantic lungs.
[171:41.17]Gigantic leech.
[171:42.87]Large shard.
[171:51.49]Nope.
[171:57.47]Give me that.
[171:57.83]Give me that.
[171:58.57]I don't even know what it was.
[172:01.35]Why are these so expensive?
[172:02.25]Oh, because they're mythic.
[172:02.89]Okay.
[172:09.37]You are a servant.
[172:10.21]Play coin game.
[172:13.19]I will play coin game today.
[172:15.21]Just sit back and relax.
[172:17.11]That's a good buy.
[172:25.84]19,000.
[172:25.90]What are you talking about?
[172:26.92]Shit.
[172:35.06]Come on.
[172:41.29]I need gigantic stuff.
[172:42.49]I think it's time to buy some stocks.
[172:47.75]I'm gonna buy stocks in... not stomach.
[172:52.68]Something expensive.
[172:54.12]Clatter?
[173:05.10]Earworms?
[173:08.18]Thyroids?
[173:10.58]Little Joey's heart.
[173:11.86]I just bought one.
[173:16.86]Is that a good idea?
[173:27.47]I could sell a lot of this right now and make some money.
[173:29.39]But I'm going to hold them.
[173:39.97]Alright, let's go.
[173:41.19]I've got shard.
[173:42.35]Bingo.
[173:43.09]You need big lo- all these like weird specific shit things.
[173:47.73]You know what I mean?
[173:48.63]Large shard.
[173:51.01]Gigant- large shard, gigantic leech, gigantic lungs.
[173:58.03]Hearts.
[174:00.43]No.
[174:02.07]Got it.
[174:05.94]Okay, that's the quest.
[174:16.07]I can get a couple more of these.
[174:19.79]Alright, let's get something going here.
[174:23.41]Old little Joey's heart.
[174:24.33]I will.
[174:25.49]Good ladder?
[174:26.23]Uh, what?
[174:29.41]I can stop coming around if you want.
[174:33.01]I know what I do ain't kind.
[174:34.67]Sign this release and you won't see my hide ever again.
[174:36.85]No, I want you.
[174:39.03]You gave me a brain that was worth $20,000.
[174:40.03]Keep coming back.
[174:44.51]Alright, heart.
[174:44.99]I need hearts.
[174:46.31]Large.
[174:47.62]Hearts.
[174:49.56]Large shit.
[174:50.26]Whatever it was.
[174:54.90]Gigantic shard, right?
[174:56.64]I don't remember.
[174:57.22]Fuck me.
[175:02.44]Large shard.
[175:04.38]Gigantic leech.
[175:05.56]Gigantic lung.
[175:09.86]Large shard.
[175:10.56]Gigantic leech.
[175:14.32]What does the leech even look like?
[175:15.18]What does it look like?
[175:19.36]Hard shard.
[175:28.76]Gigantic leech.
[175:32.18]Too expensive.
[175:33.48]I'll buy the stomach, though.
[175:34.20]It's cheap and horrible.
[175:40.04]Dude, this is... These are expensive.
[175:41.80]Just start selling them now.
[175:53.22]Free up the space.
[175:54.46]I gotta do so.
[175:54.98]I gotta get this out going here.
[175:57.78]Leech is 20.
[175:58.24]Oh, here it is.
[176:01.32]Okay, okay, okay.
[176:01.76]I need gigantic leech.
[176:07.22]Come on, come on, come on.
[176:07.76]Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
[176:10.53]Large shard.
[176:11.21]Hell yeah.
[176:15.25]Who wanted that?
[176:16.15]You did.
[176:16.61]That's 11 grand.
[176:18.17]Hell yeah.
[176:21.35]Dude.
[176:22.43]Little Joey's heart.
[176:25.66]Yeah, if you want to vote, the end of the year awards are currently available to vote on.
[176:31.04]The link right now in the chat.
[176:33.54]Go click it.
[176:36.45]There's 26 categories.
[176:37.89]This, by the way, this stream will be on New Year's Eve, not New Year's Day.
[176:43.85]Still planning on doing that.
[176:47.99]So there will be the Rumble and the awards on New Year's Eve.
[176:54.25]I'm probably going to start later in the evening so I can hit New Year's at least on Eastern time.
[176:59.71]Because I know that New Year's on Pacific time is way too late for a lot of people.
[177:06.83]So we're going to count down the New Year Eastern time like we do every year anyways.
[177:14.15]So the stream will probably start.
[177:17.06]I'd like to at least go for an hour or two probably before the New Year.
[177:22.91]So I imagine you can expect that stream to start at maybe 7 o'clock, 7.30 Pacific.
[177:32.05]Starting somewhere around like 10, 10.30 Eastern.
[177:35.28]Then we'll be able to go for an hour or two, say, oh look, happy new year, we hit the new year.
[177:39.50]And then go for like another hour or two.
[177:42.50]Just like we did last time.
[177:45.82]But, let's keep going.
[177:50.44]Good bladder.
[177:56.14]I did a large shard.
[177:59.22]Gigantic leech.
[178:01.91]Just a lung.
[178:02.75]Gigantic leech, lung, good bladder.
[178:12.10]Oh, got it.
[178:15.60]Good bladder, gigantic leech.
[178:17.10]That's too expensive.
[178:22.06]Thank you.
[178:25.75]Whoa, I know I'm just an organ harvester and you're a big ol' organ trader, but are we friends?
[178:30.35]Is that what we are?
[178:31.05]I don't know what to say to this guy.
[178:33.61]Did I say no?
[178:38.47]I feel like I have to say yes.
[178:42.51]Sure.
[178:42.73]Okay, already I see a dark blush of life flooding into Zimforth's cheeks.
[178:48.60]Give him the large eyes he deserves.
[178:50.48]Are we building a person?
[178:52.00]Okay, large eyes.
[178:56.12]We're making a person.
[178:57.38]I don't have any... Alright, let's see what I want.
[179:07.11]Cormax.
[179:10.27]Cormax, Nerve.
[179:12.17]Big Eyes.
[179:13.45]Cormax, Nerve, Big Eyes.
[179:20.24]Cormax.
[179:25.42]Shit.
[179:27.34]You're building a demon?
[179:30.06]Jesus.
[179:34.98]Anybody else want anything?
[179:37.80]Ladder?
[179:40.99]A lung?
[179:41.43]Just any lung?
[179:43.45]Wait, what is it?
[179:44.09]Does it have to be big?
[179:46.29]No, just lungs.
[179:50.75]Buy that soul.
[179:54.01]Formics?
[179:54.31]Formics?
[179:57.65]Running out of time.
[179:58.27]There we go.
[180:05.49]Hey, guys.
[180:09.09]These are gigantic.
[180:09.87]Does that matter?
[180:14.03]No, they have to be large eyes.
[180:16.23]Okay.
[180:16.81]What?
[180:22.64]I didn't eat Cormac's.
[180:29.06]Tiny eyes.
[180:29.74]I should have bought that.
[180:35.94]Idiot.
[180:38.84]I'm buying the mythic shard.
[180:39.78]Who wanted that?
[180:49.63]Oh, I just... That was a bad trade.
[180:52.15]That's a bad trade.
[181:00.84]Yeah, why would I ever sell this guy for 3,000?
[181:02.78]That's a bad trade.
[181:10.87]I'm gonna hold this stuff.
[181:18.61]Oh, shit.
[181:19.49]Nice.
[181:22.89]I'm up 30% on this shit.
[181:23.95]Stay for the funny eyeball, man.
[181:37.10]Big eyes.
[181:37.72]Let's just keep going.
[181:38.38]Hurry up.
[181:38.70]Alright, my ADHD is freaking out right now.
[181:47.54]I need a Cormix.
[181:50.80]Cormix.
[181:51.62]Nerve.
[181:52.60]Large eyes.
[181:54.32]Bladder.
[181:55.36]Cormix.
[181:56.16]Nerve.
[181:56.74]Large eyes.
[181:58.08]Nope.
[181:58.52]Cormix.
[181:59.48]Nerve.
[182:00.08]Large eyes.
[182:00.68]Bladder.
[182:02.64]Is it above or below?
[182:03.44]I don't remember.
[182:04.89]Cormix.
[182:06.76]Organ barges are, again, operational.
[182:08.13]What does that mean?
[182:13.95]Large eyes.
[182:14.75]Yep!
[182:14.89]There you go.
[182:16.41]Go make the guy.
[182:23.29]Uh, brain.
[182:27.03]Cormics.
[182:30.11]All bladder.
[182:32.46]Casino has been approved for the harvest.
[182:34.72]Leech Lymph.
[182:35.32]Alright, let's do these.
[182:37.34]Can I have one of these?
[182:41.59]Okay, Gallbladder.
[182:43.13]Double E-Cormic's.
[182:46.93]Liver, Gallbladder, Double E-Cormic's Brain.
[182:49.79]Thanks for the fucking 10 grand.
[182:54.67]Liver.
[182:56.90]Gallbladder.
[182:57.54]Double E-Cormic's.
[183:04.51]I'm going to use one of these.
[183:05.88]Forget.
[183:06.18]How much does this thing worth?
[183:17.46]This is kind of depreciating.
[183:18.82]Alright.
[183:27.59]I need a core mixes.
[183:31.31]Immediately.
[183:35.00]Hi chat, nice to meet you.
[183:35.64]The dev said your money will transfer from this game to Coin Game with a new update.
[183:45.43]That was... That was pretty good.
[183:47.85]That was really good.
[183:54.41]No, Ikharmix, this sucks.
[183:59.29]Oh!
[184:07.71]I think these are all acormixes.
[184:10.01]And a nerf cluster.
[184:10.83]I think I'm going to sell Joey's heart.
[184:19.46]25%.
[184:19.50]That's a lot of money.
[184:20.24]I don't want to lose it.
[184:26.22]I got a... Hopefully this appreciates too.
[184:31.63]And just surrounding organs.
[184:32.87]Okay, wait.
[184:33.89]I want to do this.
[184:35.54]Increase the condition.
[184:36.28]This thing kind of freaks me out.
[184:41.86]What about the kormak stalks?
[184:46.35]How are they doing right now?
[184:47.07]Dude, this is way too expensive.
[184:59.75]We're almost done with this.
[185:00.35]There's an ooze trickling from the corpse of our mutual master.
[185:03.46]Bring me the best valuable kidney you can find.
[185:11.04]Okay, bring me the best valuable kidney.
[185:17.81]I need another song.
[185:20.83]Rotcane.
[185:22.72]Rotcane kidney.
[185:25.92]Rotcane, Kidney, Double Echormics.
[185:29.78]Rotcane, Kidney, Double Echormics, Nerve.

[185:58.26]Alright.
[186:01.49]Eyeballs.
[186:04.65]Rotcane.
[186:05.95]Valuable kidney.
[186:07.69]Echormix.
[186:08.19]Come on.
[186:15.27]Valuable kidney.
[186:18.96]Valuable kidney.
[186:25.54]Valuable kidney.
[186:26.38]Valuable kidney.
[186:27.76]E-Cormex?
[186:30.56]Where's that other E-Cormex?
[186:32.62]E-Cormex?
[186:37.90]What?
[186:39.86]Make sure it's small.
[186:42.32]Oh.
[186:43.86]Small E-Cormex.
[186:45.82]Roctane.
[186:46.76]Good kidney.
[186:53.85]Oh, shut up!
[186:56.88]Oh, shut up!
[186:57.68]I despise so many of these!
[187:01.09]What the fuck?
[187:05.53]I'm buying them, though.
[187:15.01]Ugh, that sucks.
[187:18.71]I'm losing money on this.
[187:19.61]Get rid of it.
[187:23.69]Get rid of this, too.
[187:26.20]Small and it's not valuable.
[187:33.26]Whatever, I don't care.
[187:40.69]Cormac stock is a great idea right now though.
[187:43.35]Oh my goodness gracious.
[187:44.73]Yes.
[187:50.95]I'm going all in.
[187:52.73]I'm not kidding.
[187:53.23]I'm going all in. $63,000.
[188:01.38]Look at all this Cormac's bullshit.
[188:12.05]Increasing condition of nearby organs.
[188:14.15]That should be good.
[188:14.67]I kind of made a face.
[188:24.81]So now I want to do this quest.
[188:29.74]Valuable kidney.
[188:31.47]Roctanes are just expensive.
[188:33.83]Small, okay.
[188:40.29]Valuable kidney?
[188:41.13]Nope.
[188:43.55]Roctane.
[188:44.79]What?!
[188:48.01]Are you kidding me?
[188:53.11]Shit.
[188:57.64]Roctane.
[188:58.70]Come on.
[188:59.58]Valuable kidney.
[189:00.70]Somewhere.
[189:01.12]Dammit.
[189:05.94]Valuable?
[189:06.38]Oop.
[189:07.51]Got it.
[189:16.23]Heart.
[189:18.99]Okay, I need... Heart.
[189:23.17]Heart.
[189:25.73]Roctane.
[189:27.41]Small Echormix.
[189:32.70]Heart.
[189:32.92]Good.
[189:34.70]That's a good return.
[189:43.78]Hearts.
[189:44.22]Any hearts?
[189:44.68]Let me see.
[189:45.14]Heart.
[189:45.34]0-0.
[189:45.70]There's one.
[189:52.86]Build the organ bar.
[189:53.72]It's a small pancreas ship and arrives at every port in the vicinity, sending market prices into a freefall.
[190:00.32]Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy it, buy it.
[190:08.25]Buy the whole thing.
[190:15.63]Okay, I need a... I've got a small acormax.
[190:18.67]Take that.
[190:19.11]Thank you.
[190:19.45]I need a heart within a few days.
[190:22.63]This is all just kind of junk here.
[190:23.73]I'm just going to delete these.
[190:25.38]What do you got?
[190:32.90]A small leech lymph.
[190:36.66]I need a lung and a liver.
[190:38.23]Small leech lymph, lung and a liver.
[190:48.50]Lung?
[190:49.96]That's valuable.
[190:50.50]No.
[190:50.56]Alright, alright.
[190:54.28]I'm just going to go tomorrow.
[190:56.00]I'm withdrawing.
[190:56.66]Jerma, please tell a joke.
[190:57.50]Please tell a joke.
[190:58.06]I'm withdrawing.
[191:02.20]Withdraw!
[191:02.60]Alright, we're good.
[191:16.74]Okay.
[191:18.12]Oh, it's going to go back up here and it's going to be $150,000.
[191:25.77]That's big.
[191:36.78]I bet you the Necromancer guy is going to be back tomorrow.
[191:40.14]I'll probably get another ending here.
[191:42.34]After we get another ending, I'm going to update Coin Game.
[191:46.76]And we'll check out the new update.
[191:47.78]I want to play Monster Rancher 2 again, though.
[191:52.14]In the new year, we'll figure that out.
[191:53.33]Alright.
[191:55.87]Leech Lymph.
[191:58.59]Lung Liver.
[191:59.71]Small Leech Lymph.
[192:02.71]Alright.
[192:07.57]Lung Liver.
[192:09.61]Small Leech Lymph.
[192:10.66]Alright.
[192:16.32]Oh, fuck.
[192:16.82]I don't have any space.
[192:19.39]Oh, my God.
[192:20.37]Oh, my God.
[192:21.33]Oh, my God.
[192:22.31]Oh, my God.
[192:26.09]Oh, I'm going to make a lot of money today.
[192:29.75]You know what that means, right?
[192:32.63]You know what that means?
[192:35.70]That means that that stock that I bought is way up.

[195:25.86]15 capacity.
[195:29.60]Slows decay of all organs by 50%.
[195:30.88]Okay.
[195:31.18]So it's not bad.
[195:39.14]18 capacity.
[195:39.70]Okay, so this protects the ship from hazardous cargo.

[204:50.89]I'll sell the leeches.
[204:52.93]Yeah, I don't need them.
[204:54.83]Keep the eyeball.
[204:55.51]Alright, let's go.

[212:22.05]We need a mythic rot cane as well if you can find one.
[212:24.93]Got it.
[212:28.44]Now we need a song valve?
[212:33.52]What the hell is a song valve?
[212:36.14]This is just gonna rot.
[212:37.86]Everything.
[212:46.90]What the hell is that?
[212:47.94]Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is that?
[212:48.54]What is that?
[212:49.93]Oh my god, I can see an ending.
[212:54.21]I'm going for it.
[212:57.79]The lab is gone, but I can modify song valve and mythic rock game when I... I'll fill the damn sky with meat.
[213:02.89]I want to see it.
[213:10.06]The guy that we've been giving... The first meteor strike was greeted with joy.
[213:16.88]Desperate and decadent alike saw a cause for celebration.
[213:21.18]Free organs.
[213:24.70]New opportunities.
[213:26.46]Organs for everyone.
[213:31.02]Please put it in PogChamp only mode, where they can only write PogChamp.
[213:34.50]So they have to leave.
[213:37.72]Then the second meteor struck, and the third.
[213:42.91]Thank you.
[213:43.29]Appreciate it.
[213:47.94]The people that are writing ResidentSleeper and other emotes, they're hacking the website.
[213:53.96]It's ridiculous that we have that many people that are computer hackers.
[213:56.98]It's kind of annoying.
[213:57.56]Okay.
[214:02.85]Everywhere is the smell of meat.
[214:05.79]Everywhere the stink of flesh.
[214:08.41]Buried body.
[214:09.01]Wait, did I just kill everybody?
[214:12.17]Avenues of escape are the new normal.
[214:13.61]I just killed everybody.
[214:18.26]Galaxies of children who cannot understand that there are colors that are not red.
[214:23.96]We finally have enough organs for everyone.
[214:27.54]We're choking on them.
[214:32.45]Jesus.
[214:35.97]This game's really fun.
[214:36.55]I like this game a lot.
[214:37.21]Alright, let me download Coin Game.
[214:44.73]I said, by the way, I said download, not play.
[214:56.76]This game's awesome.
[214:59.02]Space Organ Trading Simulator.
[215:02.16]Space Warlord Trading Simulator.
[215:04.32]Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator.
[215:06.06]There we go, I got it.
[215:06.60]I wonder what the worst ending is.
[215:12.06]I could play a little more, but it's been four hours.
[215:19.31]If I'm going to give Coin Game an hour or two, then this is probably the time to do it.
[215:23.80]Alright, wake up!
[215:24.64]Wake up, children!
[215:25.72]Wake up, children!
[215:26.60]Okay, give me a sec.
[215:38.93]Actually, this is probably a good place to go pee.
[215:42.27]And I will play a coin game.
[215:44.31]The new update.
[215:50.25]What did they add?
[215:52.44]I guess we'll find out.
[215:53.47]Be right back.
