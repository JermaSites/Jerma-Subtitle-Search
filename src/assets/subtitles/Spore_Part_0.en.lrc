[00:11.36]This is 45 minutes of spores all you need to get bored You know that that is true that is true What's true that all it takes is 45 minutes of sport To get for what?
[00:29.68]Oh, you're bored?
[00:32.24]Yeah, would you really want to do a whole stream about that?
[00:34.56]I don't think I would, actually, now that I think about it.
[00:40.65]Here you go, guys.
[00:41.45]Alright, by popular demand, we're going to end the stream by making a spore monster.
[00:49.45]Alright, I'm probably going to go ahead and...
[00:55.37]And mine, I suppose.
[00:56.83]Yeah, it was a good like two and a half hours.
[00:58.05]That was like fun.
[00:59.51]Yeah, it was good.
[01:00.29]If there was like 30, okay, if that ice level was there and we could do that.
[01:05.37]Yeah, that would be enough.
[01:06.71]That would be like a good start for like early access.
[01:08.80]Because that would be at least another like 45 minutes.
[01:11.32]Yeah.
[01:11.62]Maybe an hour.
[01:12.36]They really just kind of teased us there.
[01:14.26]That's not cool.
[01:16.60]That was in yesterday's patch, Jeremy.
[01:17.96]You just put the first level in.
[01:19.18]It's one level a day.
[01:20.34]One level a day.
[01:21.90]It was fun.
[01:24.38]Well, if there's anything else you're going to go play, I wish you luck.
[01:29.42]It was fun.

[02:18.52]I'll make it a creature.
[02:20.50]We'll make some monsters.
[02:21.34]It's going to be loud.
[02:25.66]Just warning you, this shit's going to be loud.
[02:27.72]Let me change my stream title to Sabor.
[02:38.07]Got to be loud.
[02:38.83]Turn it down, turn it down, turn it down, turn it down.
[02:40.93]Turn your volume down now.
[02:42.37]This is your last chance.
[02:43.47]Turn it down.
[02:46.15]I'm going to try to rescue you as best I can.
[02:47.94]I think I all tapped.
[02:51.80]I think I got it.
[02:58.12]Yeah, okay.
[02:58.76]I think I just saved everybody.
[02:59.82]Let me just turn it down from here.
[03:04.44]Spore, there it is.
[03:06.61]Alright.
[03:10.59]So, let me move that.
[03:13.55]If you want to stick around for Spore, please stick around for Spore if you'd like to.
[03:16.57]If not, then it's cool.
[03:18.19]I'll see you guys next week.
[03:19.35]And we'll be doing cool, fun stuff next week.
[03:23.13]Spore, there it is.
[03:25.90]And will it open?
[03:28.45]I can't tell, because it's in like 1280x720.
[03:29.85]Hopefully you guys can see this.
[03:33.03]The thing that everybody's been asking for.
[03:45.15]Saved stream.
[03:47.64]But that was fun.
[03:48.22]You guys didn't think that was fun?
[03:49.14]That was fun.
[03:49.62]I already have a Spore account.
[03:56.08]Oh god, no.
[04:02.29]Don't ever say this again.
[04:03.63]No.
[04:06.49]We need a... Settings.
[04:10.86]I don't even know if you guys can see this.
[04:14.30]Cache size.
[04:15.10]Look at this.
[04:15.44]1920 by 1080.
[04:17.76]Where are you at?
[04:18.18]Does it even exist?
[04:18.98]Where's the 120 hertz for 1920 by 1080?
[04:19.66]There it is.
[04:19.98]Audio settings.
[04:20.40]Master.
[04:24.98]Bring it down.
[04:34.56]That's fine.
[04:35.64]Right there.
[04:36.22]Alright.
[04:40.10]How come it didn't update?
[04:44.52]Update my settings, man.
[04:45.30]Alright, let me just pee.
[04:54.58]What should this die?
[04:57.93]I didn't know it was this small.
[04:59.80]I was alt-tabbed.
[05:00.72]It's a square.
[05:02.98]Alright, hold on.
[05:05.42]I'll be right back.
[05:06.12]Let me just go pee.
[05:07.80]And we'll get this going for like an hour or so.
[05:09.98]I'll be right back.
[05:16.26]Wait, what?
[05:38.95]Yeah.
[08:31.06]Why are we in emote only mode?
[08:32.50]What happened?
[08:37.06]Have we figured out why this is in a square in front of me?
[08:41.84]And why I can't fix this shit?
[08:44.76]Do I have to restart the game?
[08:50.55]Oh, okay.
[08:53.01]Let's restart it.
[08:59.62]Why am I getting shushed?
[09:02.68]Why am I getting shushed?
[09:03.32]What happened?
[09:05.68]Nobody tell him.
[09:09.16]Why is this doing this?
[09:15.99]This shouldn't be a tiny little square in my screen.
[09:23.41]Somebody donated a hundred bucks.
[09:24.45]That's what happened.
[09:28.17]Don't, hold on.
[09:29.65]Spoychem says, don't tell him I gave him 100 million bits.
[09:35.60]Well, you guys are actually pretty good with that.
[09:38.62]Yeah, I would have been trying to figure this shit out.
[09:43.16]But thank you so much, dude.
[09:46.26]Thank you for the 100 bucks.
[09:48.30]Wow, chat.
[09:49.38]Someone gave it away.
[09:50.89]Damn it.
[09:54.85]Well, that's very nice of you.
[09:58.98]I found you out, man.
[10:00.44]But $100 is $100.
[10:01.20]There's a large amount of paper.
[10:05.90]Thanks a lot.
[10:06.88]Really appreciate that.
[10:09.03]Much love to you, Spoycam.
[10:10.57]Hope you're having a great day.
[10:13.67]And then also, Shortstop2018 gave $3.
[10:17.41]while ago.
[10:17.85]It said, I didn't even know there was a Bloody Trapland 2.
[10:20.67]Nobody did.
[10:21.76]That's why we played it.
[10:24.36]Nobody, like, knew it was coming.
[10:26.22]It kind of just came out, like, I think they first started talking about it, like, a week or two ago.
[10:29.86]I don't know.
[10:32.74]And then GummyMonkWith5Buck says, wait, wait, wait, wait, you never beat Dark Souls on stream.
[10:37.17]God gamer status is in question.
[10:39.87]No, I've never beat Dark Souls 1 on stream.
[10:41.65]I've never beat Dark Souls 2 on stream.
[10:43.21]I've never beat Bloodborne on stream.
[10:47.06]I did most of that off-stream.
[10:50.12]But let's get this figured out, because I can't, like, play in a fucking... Okay, now it's fine.
[10:55.74]I think we're good to go now.
[10:58.56]Alright.
[10:59.74]You guys wanted it.
[11:00.90]You're gonna get it.
[11:03.39]Create a creature, right?
[11:07.49]This is what everybody wanted.
[11:10.27]Just let's play.
[11:10.87]Let's go.
[11:11.97]Play the game.
[11:14.85]New game.
[11:17.35]I don't know what any of this means.
[11:18.49]New game.
[11:21.56]The cell stage.
[11:25.68]Choose your diet.
[11:26.92]Uh, we're meat eaters.
[11:29.26]Normal is fine.
[11:31.32]Uh, name your planet.
[11:33.92]This is, okay.
[11:35.94]Uh, name the planet.
[11:39.35]Hmm...
[11:50.09]That's awful.
[11:51.29]Times are strange.
[11:52.23]That's not describing the planet.
[11:58.82]Grakloid.
[12:00.28]The planet Grakloid.
[12:01.52]There's the sun.
[12:15.54]Offline in Boston, Massachusetts.
[12:21.18]The planet Boston.
[12:26.24]That's so stupid.
[12:35.31]What am I playing this for?
[12:40.64]Doesn't this part of the game suck?
[12:42.94]Isn't this part not fun?
[12:51.10]You fly around and you eat... You're like a fish and you eat people, right?
[12:55.54]There I am.
[12:57.19]Welcome to the Taipu.
[12:57.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:58.95]As a cell, your mission is to eat, grow, and evolve.
[13:00.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:01.63]Making progress.
[13:02.11]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:03.49]There it is.
[13:03.85]As you grow larger.
[13:04.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:05.57]Okay.
[13:07.21]Just gotta eat things.
[13:13.70]Okay, yep.
[13:15.06]I gotta... You gotta eat just... We're only eating meat.
[13:18.48]Only meat.
[13:22.81]I just want a strict meat diet, no veggies.
[13:27.01]Absolutely zero vegetables.
[13:30.61]I want you guys to really take me on on this one, because if I eat one vegetable, I'm going to end the stream.
[13:39.91]Only eat, only eat people.
[13:41.84]There's another one, there's another person.
[13:49.32]Whatever.
[13:52.62]Okay.
[13:57.04]You see the new part appears.
[13:58.18]Wait, I don't think I want to do that.
[14:00.44]I almost just ate that vegetable.
[14:03.97]That was close.
[14:06.65]Attack beak.
[14:09.37]Okay.
[14:10.81]How the hell do I do that?
[14:14.77]Call a mate to enter the cell crater.
[14:19.57]I forget this whole game, really.
[14:23.56]There's just a cat outside my door.
[14:25.96]I couldn't tell if that was in the game or what.
[14:31.60]What's- that's technically a vegetable?
[14:32.96]No, it isn't.
[14:33.32]That's like a leg.
[14:34.06]That was a person's leg.
[14:38.94]Okay, we're growing bigger.
[14:43.58]Oh shit, that might have been a vegetable.
[14:48.18]I'm kind of getting chased too.
[14:53.61]Wrap around this way.
[14:57.95]Who made this game?
[14:58.63]Didn't somebody make, like, somebody important in the gaming industry, weren't they?
[15:01.07]Like, this is my magnum opus.
[15:02.57]Who was it?
[15:05.63]Will, uh, what's his name?
[15:06.77]Am I, am I gonna mate with this huge thing?
[15:17.89]What?
[15:19.55]That's not us mating.
[15:21.97]Apparently.
[15:22.43]I guess.
[15:27.15]Like, you and I, I thought we... Who's my mate?
[15:29.37]There is my mate.
[15:33.71]Alright, we just did it.
[15:40.44]Cell creator, you can change modes.
[15:41.94]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:42.76]Give him some spikes on his face.
[15:50.60]Better eyes.
[15:53.58]And I want them to be that color.
[15:57.02]This one.
[15:59.78]Like that.
[16:00.94]Yeah, that works for me.
[16:36.43]Whoa, what's going on on the screen?
[16:41.15]What?
[16:42.19]What just happened?
[16:45.86]What was that?
[16:48.50]Don't change colors, it bugs out the game?
[16:51.32]What?
[16:57.26]What on earth was that?
[16:59.11]I'm sorry about that.
[17:00.29]What the fuck?
[17:04.38]Hold on, so you're telling me there's a bug in the game where if you change colors... The whole game freaks out and does that?
[17:12.27]That was happening the whole time?
[17:17.41]Well... I... I am so sorry.
[17:20.81]I'm gonna eat some more meat.
[17:34.82]Oh, God.
[17:38.96]We're almost out of the cell stage.
[17:40.10]We're almost halfway there.
[17:40.94]We just have to get away from the big octopus.
[17:47.64]And this other thing.
[17:48.32]Whatever this is.
[17:48.82]Oh, God.
[17:49.22]I'm gonna die.
[17:50.26]I can't die in Spore.
[17:51.28]This game is... This was like an educational game for kids.
[17:57.95]I need some, like, mates.
[18:00.11]Where are my mates?
[18:00.63]Alright, like, I'm gonna die.
[18:04.45]This one guy won't leave me alone.
[18:05.69]Why is everybody following me?
[18:13.32]Get away from me.
[18:18.82]That was happening the whole time.
[18:20.08]I, like, I'm so sorry.
[18:21.32]I had no idea.
[18:23.32]I didn't know that pressing change color was gonna do that.
[18:25.58]This guy won't get the fuck away from me.
[18:28.51]I'm dead.
[18:34.97]Okay.
[18:37.01]Can we have, like, another child, please?
[18:38.35]This is my history.
[18:45.14]God, count the deaths.
[18:47.66]Oh, look!
[18:48.00]There's my mate!
[18:52.00]I was gonna say, just like the praying mantis, I'm gonna, like, eat my wife.
[18:55.88]Well, the wife eats me, right?
[18:59.30]Gamer card revoked.
[19:00.29]Wait, there's more things we can do, right?
[19:03.87]Apparently not.
[19:05.47]Hold on.
[19:08.47]I ain't gonna change any colors.
[19:11.73]No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[19:13.31]Like, I just... What the fuck?
[19:17.31]Stop that shit.
[19:18.57]I'm about to... Stop that nonsense.
[19:27.72]God.
[19:28.26]Okay, I think I have to eat a vegetable.
[19:34.01]Yeah, we gotta eat a vegetable.
[19:36.33]Can't keep living like this.
[19:39.77]I've had, like, constant constipation.
[19:43.06]I don't think my guy will even eat that.
[19:50.26]Game's great.
[19:56.83]I'm gonna have to turn off my game capture before I change the color.
[20:07.27]Oh, I need the herbivore mouth.
[20:08.81]The herbivore.
[20:10.73]Well, fine.
[20:11.11]I'll just lock you in here and I'll eat you.
[20:13.23]All you guys are going to get stuck here.
[20:18.83]It is cool to see the giant things in the background.
[20:24.75]Oh, man.
[20:25.92]This is going to take a while.
[20:28.68]This is going to take a little longer than I thought.
[20:32.94]Just make creatures in the editor?
[20:34.14]Well, that's no fun because then I won't be able to do anything with them.
[20:38.04]I'll just be able to have, like, a monster to walk around and dance.
[20:45.24]I'll get there, don't worry.
[20:48.08]I'm even bigger now.
[20:49.74]This shit just got real.
[20:57.17]Where's the meat, where's the meat?
[20:59.23]Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it.
[21:02.70]Nice new part.
[21:06.35]I'm liking that.
[21:07.05]Should I call the mate?
[21:08.81]Should we, like, have weird cell sex again?
[21:14.28]Why do I feel like these are other... You know what this reminds me of?
[21:18.10]This is just Agario.
[21:23.48]This is Agario with more graphics.
[21:26.16]There was always that one guy that was never, ever, ever beaten in Agario.
[21:36.74]He got to be the size of the whole entire screen.
[21:41.40]And he never lost.
[21:46.61]40 years before Agario.
[21:48.35]Alright.
[21:49.59]What can I do with these?
[21:50.31]Anything?
[21:51.57]Nothing?
[21:55.24]Why do I keep spending these on eyes?
[22:10.27]I want these to be, like, right there.
[22:19.22]Oh, my God.
[22:20.34]Honest to fucking God, guys.
[22:21.70]Like, I'm gonna have to do something here.
[22:23.52]We're gonna have to go with, like, a straight-up just window capture.
[22:28.36]Like, I ain't gonna make you guys have to see that again.
[22:30.90]That's so fucking stupid.
[22:35.40]Here.
[22:35.50]Here.
[22:37.44]I'm just going to do window capture like that.
[22:39.14]What the fuck?
[22:40.66]That shit ain't cool.
[22:45.72]Window capture.
[22:50.23]Whatever, like move this.
[22:56.45]Okay, here.
[22:57.31]Because I feel like that's going to happen somewhere else.
[23:02.69]Like that shit will happen.
[23:07.34]There.
[23:07.56]Okay.
[23:12.22]There we go.
[23:13.22]Now that shit's not gonna happen again.
[23:20.23]Or is it just running like shit?
[23:23.29]Oh my god.
[23:27.56]Uuugh.
[23:30.56]Windowed full screen in Spore?
[23:32.22]Oh, I don't think that exists.
[23:34.33]Like... Hold on.
[23:36.50]Give me a break.
[23:50.87]I just don't even know what to say.
[23:55.74]I have nothing to say.
[23:57.40]Besides, it could be like a bunch of swears, but I'm not going to do that.
[24:03.38]Windowed fullscreen wasn't invented until 2016.
[24:05.21]Come here!
[24:09.09]Come here!
[24:11.11]The better to see you with, my dear.
[24:14.89]Don't kill me.
[24:16.09]This is a children's game.
[24:17.65]Don't kill me.
[24:21.80]I'm just like, please, give me the treats.
[24:24.11]I'm gonna die.
[24:27.35]There's so much food over here.
[24:29.13]Get out of the way.
[24:34.45]There we go.
[24:34.95]Now I'm big man on campus.
[24:40.97]Thought you could mess around with me?
[24:42.17]Nope.
[24:43.25]Not gonna mess around with me.
[24:47.27]I'll eat your meat.
[24:50.40]I will eat your meat.
[24:57.12]Family-friendly stream.
[24:59.44]This is what you guys wanted.
[25:01.50]You guys wanted me to play Spore.
[25:04.81]And to play Spore, you have to play for like an hour, and then play the fun part of Spore for 30 minutes, and then never play it again.

[28:06.33]That shouldn't be happening.
[28:11.57]Clown car.

[33:48.21]What do you mean he doesn't have a mouth?
[33:52.32]He has a mouth, what?

[38:16.24]I want to address, like, I was doing, like, that jokey, like, little 12-year-old writing as a joke.
[38:22.34]Because, like, that's what, like, a little kid would write.
[38:24.94]That was part of the bit.
[38:26.64]I'm glad you picked up on it.
[38:33.56]Alright, here we go.

[40:59.71]There's nothing I can do.
[41:01.85]This whole game is just a fucking broken mess.
[41:07.94]I wish I could do this.
[41:09.86]There's nothing I can do, guys.
[41:13.16]It's just an epilepsy warning stream in 240p.
[41:19.30]God!
[41:19.84]Alright, that's it.
[41:20.44]You know, that's it.

[41:29.22]It's just over.
[41:29.90]I'm gonna, I'm gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna go out on something else.
[41:32.95]Because I ain't fucking doing that shit.
[41:35.77]Oh my god.
[41:42.11]Play Spore, he says.
[41:44.07]Play Spore, they say.
[41:46.33]Germo, you should play Spore.
[41:48.85]You should play Spore.
[41:50.29]That's a fucking great idea.
