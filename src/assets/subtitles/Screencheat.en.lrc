[00:03.49]Three, two, one!
[00:05.42]Screen cheat!
[00:06.24]What the f- What the hell is that?
[00:08.28]Okay, okay, everybody.
[00:09.00]This is screen cheat.
[00:10.60]I'm on the left, Jerma's on the right.
[00:12.28]We can both see each other's screens right now, but what we can't see, we're invisible in the game.
[00:17.21]You have to look at the other person's screen to figure out where they are.
[00:20.33]This is truly freaking me out.
[00:21.59]Yeah, it's a little bit freaky to... I don't know.
[00:24.53]I feel like I'm playing both of these at the same time.
[00:27.07]Where are- oh wait, hold on, hold on, I think I know where you are.
[00:30.21]You're somewhere around here.
[00:34.17]Oh, you can see the smoke trail, you can see the smoke trail, that's cheating.
[00:38.14]So you can't- we can't see each other, but we can look at each other's screens and screen cheat.
[00:42.68]Ah, this is hurting, I gotta like sit back.
[00:46.90]Got him!
[00:47.46]What?!
[00:48.32]Got him.
[00:48.92]Look at your chicken butt on the ground.
[00:51.17]Hold on, you can switch weapons?
[00:52.81]There's a ton of different weapons!
[00:54.15]Well, I think we gotta find them.
[00:55.71]How do you switch?
[00:56.85]Uh, Q and E?
[00:58.21]This is not doing nothing.
[00:59.51]Oh, hold on.
[01:00.09]You're over by the manatee.
[01:02.01]I'm coming down to you.
[01:05.03]You're over by the manatee.
[01:06.23]You're gonna get killed.
[01:07.89]Oh, yeah, you wanna shoot up the stairs, huh?
[01:09.17]Is that what you wanna do?
[01:10.41]You wanna shoot up the stairs?
[01:11.43]Oh, you wanna shoot up the stairs?
[01:13.23]I don't even... This game is actually pretty satisfying when you actually, like...
[01:20.10]lining up you can't stand next to anything recognizable that's the thing I was like you guys by the second pillow did we just walk by each other yeah we did oh how did you even do that that was pure luck that was just a guess that was like I guess I'll shoot somewhere are you over here now you're either ready seriously I feel like I'm wearing three glasses and like each eye is watching like a different movie or something
[01:41.67]Alright, no, no, no, okay, okay, yeah, I'm not gonna fall for your bullshit, cause I know exa- Okay, look at that, look where he's aiming!
[01:46.99]Oh yeah?
[01:47.21]Yeah, what do you think about this one?
[01:49.03]Oh, no, wrong side, wrong side.
[01:51.90]Wait, you are aiming, you're aiming down towards... Dang!
[01:55.78]I'm just gonna look, this is what you do when you're not shooting.
[01:58.56]I'm just gonna get to- Yeah, that's a good idea, that's a good idea.
[02:01.65]You don't know where I am, you can't- Are you on the dinosaur hand?
[02:04.23]I'm standing on the dinosaur-
[02:06.63]We're- This is not fun anymore, we're ruining the point of the game!
[02:12.19]We really are just ruining the game.
[02:13.64]Alright, I know where you are.
[02:15.92]I know exactly- I know the exact moment where you're gonna be standing- Can I zoom in with this thing?
[02:22.24]Can you do it?
[02:22.92]I don't know.
[02:23.40]I saw you- Oh!
[02:26.04]He's standing right next to me.
[02:28.34]This is stressful, this is a stressful-ass game.
[02:32.58]I can feel it.
[02:33.00]I'm gonna just watch you.
[02:34.60]Oh my god.
[02:35.34]I'm getting destroyed right now.
[02:37.44]I can't go flawless.
[02:38.92]I'm taking the escalator.
[02:40.67]I'm not gonna get flawless right now.
[02:42.37]Five.
[02:42.71]It's to five.
[02:48.90]I'm like scared to walk down this hole because you're gonna kill me I was just watching your screen with the crosshair there like as soon as he turns this corner.
[03:00.11]I'm not even looking I'm left-clicking get destroyed
[03:04.60]That one didn't count.
[03:05.62]You cheated.
[03:06.16]Alright, one more.
[03:09.66]One more go.
[03:10.37]One more go.
[03:10.89]One more time.
[03:11.35]One more go.
[03:12.73]I'm going for it.
[03:14.49]I like that shotgun though.
[03:15.89]I'm just going to stick with the shotgun.
[03:17.17]You get that nice blast.
[03:18.67]You only need one shot.
[03:20.40]Ready or not.
[03:21.28]Mom's spaghetti.
[03:24.55]Oh come on you gonna play that?
[03:33.09]You gonna play that game?
[03:47.11]I see you.
[03:48.11]I saw you first, but not actually.
[03:50.73]But I saw kind of where you were.
[03:52.39]Give me the blunderbuss.
[03:54.29]Oh, I would have killed you.
[03:55.57]Alright, you're currently right up there.
[04:00.43]I'm trying to concentrate here.
[04:02.05]Yeah, this game requires a lot of focus to figure everything out, so I'm having a hard time here.
[04:09.35]Oh my god, dude.
[04:11.45]I am a grand champion.
[04:12.71]How do you even know?
[04:15.71]I'm so busy, like, trying to figure out your screen that I'm not even paying attention to my- I'm just like, standing still, I need to look at my screen and your- You know what, no more excuses, let's go.
[04:28.28]I'm so focused, I don't have anything to say.
[04:31.10]That's just unbelievable!
[04:34.14]This guy's pretty excited about it.
[04:39.08]Let's make fun of old, historical, classic paintings.
[04:43.02]We didn't make fun of it, he was screaming.
[04:46.58]I can't.
[04:47.00]I can't.
[04:49.03]They call me Peashooter McGee.
[04:51.75]Actually, they call me D-Bag Johnson.
[04:53.05]You don't want to know how I got that name.
[04:54.97]No one calls you that.
[04:57.59]Do you want to go again?
[04:58.27]Do you want to do, like, one more?
[04:59.72]Yes, yes, I do.
[05:00.38]I'm going to try my absolute hardest.
[05:02.56]Okay, me too.
[05:03.52]I'm going to try my hardest as well.
[05:05.60]That means I can't speak, by the way.
[05:07.10]Okay, don't speak.
[05:07.88]This is it.
[05:09.08]All or nothing.
[05:09.46]This is the round.
[05:11.12]Ready or not.
[05:12.97]Mom's spaghetti.
[05:15.40]Okay, I don't even think we're looking at the right places.
[05:17.28]I don't think we are either.
[05:18.66]Okay, yeah, maybe a little bit close to the right place.
[05:21.02]I can't.
[05:22.50]I can't.
[05:23.92]It's too much for my brain.
[05:28.64]I'm standing completely still.
[05:30.36]No, you... I'm like lying back in my chair right now.
[05:37.32]No.
[05:43.98]I thought I had you.
[05:45.03]I thought the guy dying was you because I was looking at the other screen.
[05:48.93]You know what I mean?
[05:50.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:51.31]Figured it out.
[05:51.77]Figured it out.
[05:55.07]Somebody learned how to play Scream Mania.
[05:58.55]What's the name of this game?
[06:00.36]Scream Mania.
[06:02.08]Scream Mania.
[06:02.80]That's what we're playing right now.
[06:04.00]I don't even think you said scream.
[06:07.10]Did I say Scream Mania?
[06:08.82]I think so.
[06:09.78]No, I think I'm pretty sure I said Scream Mania.
[06:11.84]I don't know.
[06:12.22]You have to listen to it.
[06:17.50]Oh, you're in here now.
[06:18.54]GOD!
[06:18.90]You can just wait for the one person to shoot, and then, like, look at the smoke trail, but that's... Still need to know.
[06:29.65]One kill to win.
[06:30.57]What?!
[06:31.17]You killed me, like, three seconds late!
[06:33.19]I- You killed me way too late as well, on my end.
[06:35.75]No, I killed you early!
[06:36.99]No, you didn't.
[06:38.09]You didn't kill me.
[06:38.63]What is this latency?
[06:39.33]What's the ping here?
[06:40.35]I'm not even... I'm not even... looking.
[06:42.70]My ping!
[06:43.36]What's your ping?
[06:46.08]Oh, you're right by the dinosaur mouth, huh?
[06:54.93]This is not how games work!
[06:58.65]And then the game just squirted all over us.
[07:01.97]Who won?
[07:02.53]Did you win?
[07:03.05]I don't know.
[07:03.83]I won.
[07:04.17]My name's blank.
[07:05.07]Why is my name blank?
[07:07.89]I'm doing... No, you know what?
[07:09.44]I'm just gonna go melee.
[07:11.44]Oh, dad.
[07:12.84]I saw the guy who was standing still and I shook him.
[07:16.16]The guy, like, in, like, the buy menu in CSGO somehow just got, like, just destroyed.
[07:20.95]Alright, where are you?
[07:21.63]I see you.
[07:22.57]There's too many things to look at.
[07:25.05]You do got to look at the colors.
[07:26.63]But, again, as I said, I didn't learn colors.
[07:28.73]Double kill.
[07:30.67]Dude, what?
[07:32.85]What?
[07:35.25]Double kill.
[07:35.91]Everybody's up at the purple, huh?
[07:37.11]Oh, I'm figuring it out.
[07:39.29]Everybody's up at purple.
[07:40.31]Everybody's up at the purple area.
[07:42.05]To win.
[07:42.41]Nope, nope, nope.
[07:43.99]Ah, I was on a spree.
[07:45.82]Did that just say you got Google Translated by Star?
[07:49.24]Did I?
[07:50.18]That's what it just said.
[07:57.77]I was right behind him.
[08:01.57]Did he just get a twofer?
[08:03.37]Yeah, he did.
[08:05.19]He just got a twofer.
[08:05.89]He got six.
[08:06.61]He ended at six.
[08:07.67]Yeah, because he got a twofer.
[08:11.84]Mom, this dragon dinosaur mess.
[08:14.58]Hold on.
[08:14.98]Before we go, I just need to... Could you stop drinking and take this game seriously?
[08:23.79]I was just drinking some water.
[08:26.13]No.
[08:26.31]I need to stay hydrated.
[08:28.73]I'm just shooting cannons pointlessly.
[08:31.01]Hey, don't you know anything about hydration?
[08:33.69]Somebody's in here with me.
[08:35.13]I have bought at you.
[08:39.43]Oh, that was an accident.
[08:41.67]We're going to pretend it wasn't.
[08:44.75]That was an accident too.
[08:47.38]I'm scared of that because I just see the grenade launcher and it scares me.
[08:50.32]There's someone in here with me.
[08:51.84]Oh, I'm just killing people by accident with this stupid cannon that blows up in an AOE in the game where you need to kill people you can't see.
[09:04.06]One kill to win.
[09:05.10]God!
[09:05.40]You walked into me, bro!
[09:08.15]I was too busy watching another person's screen.
[09:10.29]You can't like pay attention to every single screen at the same time.
[09:13.85]You can if you're an elite master.
[09:18.06]Are you an elite master?
[09:19.44]No.
[09:21.36]No.
[09:22.12]Of course not.
[09:23.25]Heavens no.
[09:28.24]What?
[09:28.58]I didn't do anything!
[09:29.60]I was- I thought I died there.
[09:32.24]I didn't do shit that round.
[09:33.90]You got five- you didn't- you died one time.
[09:36.04]Grenade launcher banned.
[09:37.28]Grenade launcher banned.
[09:38.64]No grenade launcher.
[09:40.28]There you go.
[09:40.90]Okay, we might as well- Let's do that joke every time.
[09:44.02]Hey, why don't we do the same joke for everything?
[09:46.02]Okay, whoever doesn't use the rifle is a- is a... idiot.
[09:48.84]Alright, we all have the rifle.
[09:49.98]You can- you can see everyone's screen.
[09:51.32]You can make sure no one's, like, cheating.
[09:56.44]I don't know what I'm shooting at exactly.
[09:57.71]How do you reload this thing?
[09:59.67]There's a reload button?
[10:02.05]Someone's- Everyone's in the pink.
[10:03.35]Someone's- What?
[10:04.97]Who's in the pink, man?
[10:07.59]I- I was just in like the- Oh!
[10:11.01]We're all getting slammed by one man!
[10:12.89]I'm coming up this way.
[10:14.52]Who's up this way?
[10:15.34]Oh, really?
[10:17.52]Oh, really?
[10:17.96]You- No!
[10:19.79]This guy's gonna win!
[10:22.25]No, don't let him.
[10:22.93]He's gonna go five for nothing!
[10:25.35]It's over!
[10:25.79]We just got shit on!
[10:28.83]Nobody did anything!
[10:31.65]He just destroyed us!
[10:33.67]I wanna redo!
[10:34.88]I wanna redo!
[10:35.56]Here it comes!
[10:38.56]Did you see that guy do the funny thing?
[10:40.87]No, not that time, exactly.
[10:42.67]I know, neither did I, but... Again, he's got two... He is aimbotting!
[10:49.68]You can't aimbot like this.
[10:51.08]This is stupid.
[10:52.44]Does he have four eyes?
[10:53.74]He's gonna win again in a five-ball.
[10:58.52]I'm in a duel with him.
[10:59.67]I'm in the duel.
[11:01.35]Don't lose this.
[11:05.83]Can he see people?
[11:07.09]I don't know.
[11:10.03]BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
[11:38.87]You've just got to bring it, sing it, and then... SLING IT!
[11:44.23]No, that's not me.
[11:49.25]This is you right here.
[11:50.52]This is you right here, but where are you right here?
[11:52.44]I don't know.
[11:52.94]I don't know.
[11:53.56]I have no idea.
[11:54.42]I think we just bumped into each other.
[11:55.64]There's someone behind you!
[11:57.84]I shot him by accident.
[12:01.38]Yeah, we did that thing where we both just ran into each other, and we just couldn't, we had no idea where to help you.
[12:06.58]Someone's in blue, someone's in purple, someone's on the purple slash red, someone's on the... Someone's behind me.
[12:11.22]Oh, dude, if you touch those vents, you go flying.
[12:14.42]Wow.
[12:16.48]Now that's, that's, that's the strategy.
[12:19.00]That's the strategy.
[12:20.09]To just go flying and not do anything?
[12:21.83]Just pretend you're doing something?
[12:22.65]Just fly around, and, yeah.
[12:29.91]I really want to try using the... BLUNDERBUS!
[12:33.19]So you're looking at one guy's screen, but you don't even realize the guy is looking at your other screen from the other guy that's coming near you.
[12:44.90]Looking at your screen.
[12:47.19]The guy looking at your screen, who you're... The guy whose screen you're looking at, who's looking at your...
[12:55.61]You were looking at other people's fucking screens.
[12:58.11]You were card counting or something.
[13:04.03]This map is confusing.
[13:06.35]Honestly, I won, but I still don't know what was going on.
[13:09.82]There's colors everywhere.
[13:10.64]You say, look at the colors.
[13:13.52]Ooh, that turn kill.
[13:16.28]I'm just going to zoom in one of these games only on my screen, and it's got to look so stupid at me, just fumbling around and dying to nothing and killing nothing.
[13:28.33]Killing invisible people somehow.
[13:30.85]There's dudes over there.
[13:31.59]You can even see the dudes over there.
[13:33.70]Alright, there is a person right here.
[13:35.34]Oh, you want to come up the stairs?
[13:37.30]Damn it!
[13:38.14]There was somebody... I was focused on somebody in front of me, and somebody behind me.
[13:42.99]Well, he wins.
[13:44.87]Oh, don't say that.
[13:46.11]I respawned, accidentally clicked, and killed him.
[13:48.97]Across the map.
[13:50.05]I am... I am giving up.
[13:52.29]Did you just do it again?
[13:55.26]No, that was precision.
[13:57.50]That was a real shot.
[14:00.22]I did that for real.
[14:02.58]I am very impressed with myself.
[14:04.32]I don't even care that I lost that time.
[14:09.22]Hey, can you guess how impressed I am with myself?
[14:12.43]The game is starting in 3, 2, 1.
[14:14.91]Blunderbuss!
[14:17.52]I'm winning this one.
[14:18.24]This is all out try hard.
[14:20.12]Me too.
[14:21.06]Alright, fine.
[14:22.26]This is called I've never tried harder at anything in my life.
[14:29.07]While you're just swinging a freaking candle.
[14:30.81]That's not me.
[14:33.19]That's not me.
[14:34.73]Who else could it be?
[14:36.01]Why is no one killing them?
[14:38.11]Oh god, that was really close to me.
[14:45.84]Oh, dude, that was such a long-range shot.
[14:48.12]It just exploded.
[14:56.35]He's up here somewhere, buddy.
[14:59.04]Oh, did I blow up his grenade?
[15:00.88]That's what it looked like.
[15:07.66]Damn it.
[15:09.22]I'm winning this one.
[15:11.08]I'm slam dunking this one while the candlestick is just non-stop swinging.
[15:15.90]Has he got a kill?
[15:17.82]Yeah, two.
[15:18.38]He has got... No, I... I... I see I'm too busy watching your screen because you're at four and I don't want to be the guy that... Now I gotta look at both screens.
[15:30.59]He killed me with the candlestick.
[15:34.85]Someone's up the blue corner.
[15:37.95]He won with the candle!
[15:43.10]We both had five.
[15:44.12]I shot right at the end.
[15:44.98]I knew I killed someone.
[15:47.40]But why does he win and I don't?
[15:48.90]I got less deaths.
[15:50.00]Less deaths.
[15:51.14]No, shut up.
[15:52.00]Shut up.
[15:53.10]Shut up.
[15:54.38]Oh, actually, yeah, I see what you're talking about with you, actually.
[15:59.02]We've been playing for only, like, 50 minutes.
[16:04.28]My brain keeps going, you know what?
[16:05.84]There's a sandwich upstairs.
[16:07.06]Like, I can't even focus.
[16:10.65]Everything is, like, the same right now.
[16:12.89]Get the sandwich, man.
[16:21.26]That was so accidental.
[16:23.70]That was across the entire map, just like, meh, shoot, and I got somebody.
[16:29.79]I can't believe I'm getting candlestick.
[16:32.19]Oh, again!
[16:32.69]I see you with the candle.
[16:37.49]Oh, you're coming up this way, are you?
[16:39.76]Oh, you're coming up this way, are you?
[16:41.54]How did I miss?
[16:44.70]And you accidentally jump?
[16:46.58]Who is who?
[16:48.40]It looks like everyone's using the candle right now.
[16:53.04]Oh, look at Star.
[16:54.34]Looks like you're coming up this way, are you?
[16:56.52]No, I'm just... I'm doing the ground look strat.
[17:00.58]See, they're both in the same area, just all doing the same thing.
[17:08.19]And the... The sounds, the swinging sounds... Yeah, the swinging sounds are, uh... They're something, man.
[17:18.37]Hmm.
[17:18.99]Hmm.
[17:19.59]Hmm.
[17:20.24]Hmm.
[17:21.41]I'm just hiding down these lower areas.
[17:27.84]Where are these guys?
[17:28.76]Whoa!
[17:32.36]You know what?
[17:34.96]I'll play the candle game.
[17:36.62]I'm so focused.
[17:43.79]One kill to win.
[17:44.71]You want to run around with a candle?
[17:46.85]I'm the only one not candling, and I'm proud about winning this.
[17:52.03]Hey, the candle is pretty good.
[18:01.90]It is pretty good.
[18:02.56]It's really deceiving.
[18:03.61]Like, when it swings and makes that yellow, you think they're right there, and then they're not.
[18:08.65]Alright, everybody.
[18:09.51]I guess that's it.
[18:11.13]Hope you could find some enjoyment out of this.
[18:12.97]Me, uh, finally winning a game again with the shotgun.
[18:16.56]I mean, everyone else had weapons too, right?
[18:19.32]Remember, fake hair everywhere.
[18:21.48]Peace out.
