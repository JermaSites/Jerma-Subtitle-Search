[00:03.35]I didn't mean to turn this on.
[00:05.53]I pressed enter on the Streamlabs thing.
[00:08.13]I have it enter as go live.
[00:10.76]It's actually going to delay the stream to tomorrow.
[00:13.64]Sorry about that.
[00:16.50]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[00:21.13]Hey, guys.
[00:22.91]How you doing?
[00:27.13]Welcome back.
[00:31.67]Psycho.
[00:33.25]Gotta start it up.
[00:33.89]I'm excited.
[00:34.51]I'm ready to go.
[00:35.37]This is WarioWare.
[00:36.37]This is the week of games that I've been waiting for for a decade.
[00:43.40]Ever since Smooth Moves, I've been begging Nintendo to come up with a new one of these.
[00:50.20]I don't count game in Wario.
[00:51.74]That one doesn't count.
[00:54.30]This is a WarioWare game from scratch, ready to go, on Switch,
[01:00.85]Fully developed.
[01:01.87]Fully ready.
[01:06.47]I heard it's short.
[01:08.45]But, you know, whatever.
[01:13.42]We'll see how short.
[01:15.60]From what I have been seeing, it takes anywhere from three to four hours to see everything.
[01:23.91]We'll see.
[01:25.33]But I'm really happy.
[01:25.89]I'm really into it.
[01:27.15]I think it's going to be fun.
[01:28.77]I don't know.
[01:29.47]I don't want to give any judgments until I play it.
[01:31.75]The new system seems a little weird.
[01:35.39]Seems kind of weird.
[01:39.51]Yeah, I'm very early.
[01:40.83]I was just ready.
[01:42.15]Sometimes I'm just ready.
[01:42.85]Not every time, obviously.
[01:45.81]Sometimes I'm just ready to go.
[01:47.89]That is one of those times today.
[01:50.45]Hot dog.
[01:51.05]Thanks for the five.
[01:51.71]Community subs.
[01:52.25]Appreciate it.
[01:57.49]So the plan here today is we're gonna play WarioWare, and then after WarioWare, it really depends on how long this game is.
[02:05.15]If this game, in like an hour or two, I'm done with it, I was like, oh, that was cool, but I did everything, and I did everything I wanted to do.
[02:11.62]I highly doubt that's gonna happen.
[02:14.68]And I'll just do No More Heroes 3 tonight.
[02:17.68]If not, if this game takes at least three or four hours, and I am having a good time, then we'll just do No More Heroes 3 tomorrow.
[02:24.04]So you're really going to get two short streams back-to-back, or one long stream tonight?
[02:29.97]We'll find out.
[02:35.65]Uh, thank you, A Straight Pube.
[02:37.13]Why are you allowed to have that name?
[02:40.73]Is that what it is?
[02:43.75]A Pube?
[02:45.35]Thanks for the 10 community subs, I appreciate it.
[02:55.29]whatever uh so yeah I'm ready to go I think I I should we delay any longer we're just going emote only what happened we did hey thanks spigot
[03:15.97]Thank you, K5.
[03:16.59]Five community subs.
[03:18.89]There's a bug with huge emojis some people are getting.
[03:22.09]Trying to sort it out.
[03:24.16]Wait, what?
[03:26.06]Huge emojis?
[03:31.86]Well, let's see what happens.
[03:34.58]WarioWare, get it together.
[03:39.73]I'm ready.
[03:40.75]There's like a character selector in this one too.
[03:43.03]And yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm gonna do a face cam.
[03:45.77]Everybody just relax.
[03:46.83]Because I'm gonna be going like this.
[03:49.75]So of course you have to have a face cam on for this shit.
[03:57.30]Hey Casper, thanks for the five community subs!
[03:58.88]You guys ready?
[04:06.02]Alright, so this is just, I unlock shit as we go.
[04:15.12]I can't see what they're saying.
[04:16.14]What are they saying about me?
[04:18.34]Thank you, Fassad.
[04:20.84]Fassadcake for the five community subs.
[04:22.48]Appreciate it.
[04:25.50]I'm ready to go.
[04:26.20]How many players?
[04:27.10]One!
[04:27.26]Alright, so he plays Wario.
[04:35.42]Wario intro games.
[04:36.98]Change the number of plays.
[04:37.74]No, it's just me.
[04:39.72]You can play Metroid?
[04:40.50]Um, I don't know, probably.
[04:43.23]No, probably, that's a lie.
[04:44.93]I don't really play Metroid games, as much as I, like, pretend to.
[04:48.77]Metroid is a series that I pretend to, that I know anything about.
[04:51.23]Because I think people would think I was cool if I knew about it.
[04:55.51]Um, I made a tweet.
[04:57.21]Here's a fun fact about my Twitter.
[04:59.09]I made a tweet, like, three or four years ago.
[05:01.11]I believe it said something like this.
[05:03.99]It took Nintendo five years of making yarn games to realize that Metroid was a cool series.
[05:10.02]I've never played through any of the Metroid games.
[05:15.26]Any of them.
[05:15.87]Not even the Super Nintendo one.
[05:17.33]None of them.
[05:20.57]So why am I making a comment like that?
[05:21.89]Yeah, I was a poser.
[05:24.51]I was a fake fan.
[05:25.19]I was.
[05:29.08]This is WarioWare.
[05:29.92]I'm ready.
[05:31.63]That was a lie?
[05:32.23]Well, I didn't lie, I just, I didn't say, oh my god, I'm such a huge fan of Metroid, I can't wait for the new one.
[05:37.90]I just made, like, a joke about how they made a bunch of yarn games, but I didn't play any of the Metroid games.
[05:44.92]You know, no, I went like this.
[05:50.57]In Metroid Prime, Wii, and then I never played it ever again.
[05:55.26]Oh, and then I also rented from Blockbuster a copy of Metroid, Super Metroid.
[06:00.88]But it was like halfway through the game, and I jumped around in a circle a few times, and I just returned it.
[06:04.30]Alright, let's go!
[06:08.46]It's time for what?
[06:13.12]What's wrong with yarn games?
[06:14.29]Nothing.
[06:14.67]I was just being like, I was just trying to be like, oh, look at me, look at my opinion.
[06:21.13]What's this?
[06:22.43]I can't do it like that.
[06:23.07]I gotta do it like this.
[06:24.83]No wonder I am flying.
[06:26.47]I am a fly.
[06:27.25]This is because I'm inside the game.
[06:31.41]Who cares?
[06:32.01]This is gonna come out.
[06:32.99]Hey, hold on.
[06:33.91]Hey.
[06:34.77]Get out of here.
[06:40.92]This video game maker loves treasure, money, and garlic.
[06:43.78]And money, what could go wrong?
[06:45.26]This is me.
[06:49.85]I'm kind of coming to the realization that me and Wario are on the same page.
[06:55.69]This guy loves treasure.
[06:57.15]I love treasure.
[06:57.91]I love money.
[06:58.39]I love garlic.
[06:59.77]Okay.
[07:04.30]Alright, Wario attacks in whichever direction he's facing.
[07:07.46]Okay.
[07:10.02]It's like a dash.
[07:14.76]Move and attack.
[07:16.39]Break.
[07:17.91]Yeah.
[07:19.70]Okay.
[07:20.90]Push.
[07:22.46]Push.
[07:23.58]Jump.
[07:26.70]Wait, can I dash?
[07:28.04]I can only dash sideways?
[07:28.94]Yeah.
[07:29.62]Defeat.
[07:29.94]Okay, push.
[07:35.29]Alright.
[07:40.83]Is this... Look, I'm not going to do the voice.
[07:42.41]I can't do the voice.
[07:44.11]I can't do any voices with a cam on.
[07:45.55]You guys know that.
[07:47.68]Because, look, I know how stupid and ridiculous I look with it on.
[07:51.32]But if it's off, I turn the camera off.
[07:56.85]Now, all decided.
[07:58.61]That's me, a Wario.
[08:00.31]I can do Wario.
[08:02.63]I'm not doing that with the camera on.
[08:06.73]It's, like, embarrassing to have you look at me do that.
[08:11.02]Uh, this is the level I made.
[08:12.16]Oh, huh?
[08:15.78]Yeah, he made his own video game, right?
[08:18.47]Eh?
[08:19.69]That thing had messed up everything it touched.
[08:21.23]I feel like I'm the voice actor that replaced Wario and like I didn't care to do anything like the original.
[08:27.78]This is bad.
[08:28.96]It's gonna ruin my level!
[08:31.56]Gah!
[08:32.20]Wait!
[08:32.52]I hope people would fucking freak out.
[08:44.35]Cutscene!
[08:57.17]oh my god just put a bag over your head do like the voices that actually might work hold on wait wait wait the games I gotta play the game
[09:26.08]I think I failed on the first level.
[09:27.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[09:28.74]That's a really good idea.
[09:32.57]Dislodge.
[09:37.83]I'm going to hide my head.
[09:40.01]What a genius idea.
[09:40.79]Okay.
[09:42.59]Collect all.
[09:45.23]I just punched the mic?
[09:45.81]Okay, we're good.
[09:51.78]It's been so long since I've played this, I can't wait.
[10:01.76]That's what I just said.
[10:05.78]Young Cricket.
[10:07.22]Young Cricket.
[10:08.94]This devoted student of the martial arts diligently trains under Master Mantis.
[10:12.96]He likes meat dumplings a lot.
[10:18.58]Jumping is Cricket's specialty.
[10:19.82]Hold down A to perform a high jump.
[10:21.75]Okay.
[10:25.15]So everybody has their own, like, powers.
[10:29.77]Push.
[10:31.82]How high can you go?
[10:32.44]You can jump really high.
[10:34.68]Cool.
[10:37.88]Why are you in the game?
[10:38.58]I'm not.
[10:40.04]This is 18 volt.
[10:40.88]Check it.
[10:41.12]I'm here too.
[10:41.58]And get this.
[10:43.22]I can throw this disk on my head as many times as I want.
[10:47.46]I know what's even better.
[10:48.24]I don't have to move.
[10:50.46]But you don't move?
[10:51.15]Okay.
[10:52.37]18 volt throws, throws his disk in whichever direction you tilt.
[11:03.24]They can't move.
[11:05.96]Break them all, okay.
[11:09.20]Holy shit, this is interesting.
[11:10.32]I feel like this is, like, overpowered.
[11:16.49]This is completely overpowered.
[11:17.53]You said this art sucks?
[11:20.21]Alright, people just like, when they piss me off, I just fucking leave.
[11:29.88]Hey, he's fun!
[11:33.93]Alright, so do I have to... Time to join forces is the only way.
[11:37.40]Come on, let's tag team our foe.
[11:41.54]Oh shit, it switched.
[11:42.80]Alright, cool, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I got it.
[11:50.25]Memorize.
[11:51.87]You... How do you match it?
[11:56.17]Oh shit, like that, okay.
[12:01.76]Get him!
[12:05.22]Who am I getting?
[12:08.15]I got him, apparently.
[12:16.47]Oh, shit.
[12:17.15]Okay, got it.
[12:21.93]Empty.
[12:25.73]This is weird.
[12:26.35]I switched this between them.
[12:27.35]It freaks me out.
[12:27.91]Protect.
[12:33.28]Alright, I win.
[12:33.64]I got it.
[12:34.54]This game is insane.
[12:35.51]Does it get insane?
[12:36.15]I feel like it's gonna be insane.
[12:37.71]Alright, boss stage.
[12:38.77]Let's go.
[12:38.95]I love that part.
[12:41.67]Oh, look!
[12:42.41]Golly!
[13:06.43]I don't have to... There's no timer here.
[13:10.87]I'm fine.
[13:12.46]What do I do?
[13:31.11]Holy shit, are his spikes coming out of his head?
[13:33.77]Oh my fucking idiot!
[13:35.01]What are you doing?
[13:50.74]You're losing to the first boss.
[13:51.86]I'm fine.
[13:52.50]Look, I'm just gonna get in the swing of things.
[13:54.02]This is different than the other... This is different.
[13:57.84]This plays a lot differently than the other ones.
[14:00.69]It's a complete evolution of the WarioWare formula.
[14:11.40]High up.
[14:13.68]High up.
[14:17.20]Alright, it's a Nintendo game.
[14:18.52]It's three hits.
[14:19.76]How's it going?
[14:25.06]There it is.
[14:25.40]Alright, that was easy.
[14:26.06]That was easy.
[14:28.70]The emojis are fixed.
[14:31.98]I need to put a bag on my head and try to do voices.
[14:34.97]That's really important.
[14:36.43]I need to cover my head.
[14:39.57]If you guys can't see me, I can do whatever I want.
[14:41.73]I can do voices.
[14:47.57]There you are.
[14:48.05]You can't hide from Wadi.
[14:51.95]Whoa, the corruption is disappearing.
[14:55.97]Hmm, I bet that was a game bug.
[14:57.81]They make games act all glitchy.
[15:02.98]Did you turn the webcam off?
[15:06.26]No.
[15:07.08]Okay, why did I read that?
[15:08.10]Alright, so you gotta get rid of all the bugs in Wario's game.
[15:11.08]Sounds cool.
[15:13.62]Everything moved back to normal.
[15:14.38]Yeah, I'll do like the best impressions you've heard all night.
[15:18.55]Let's smash some bugs.
[15:20.37]Frickin' 18-volt, join the crew.
[15:23.45]You earned 1,000 coins for completing a level.
[15:29.22]Alright, hold on.
[15:31.90]Give me one second.
[15:33.70]I'll do this in a minute.
[15:34.36]Let me get to the first 20 minutes of the game.
[15:37.05]You unlocked Playopedia.
[15:38.09]You unlocked Missions.
[15:41.01]True.
[15:42.51]Alright, nice.
[15:43.33]Did you sleep good last night?
[15:49.83]Yeah.
[15:52.61]The PNG of Wario over your webcam.
[15:54.65]No.
[15:54.87]What year is this?
[15:59.32]Alright, let's go level 2.
[16:02.78]I wonder if this isn't going to be any- Shake the Wiimote.
[16:06.82]Hit a load of this place, the bugs really did an number on it, eh?
[16:10.38]Hello, Wario, is that you?
[16:14.56]Oh, my scooter!
[16:15.40]It won't stop!
[16:18.14]Wario VTuber.
[16:24.04]You know that Charles Martinet did that 12 years ago?
[16:29.26]They set him up with a camera that recorded his face in real time.
[16:33.47]He would go to conventions and he did VTuber Mario at conventions.
[16:37.47]That's like how it all started.
[16:41.35]The original VTuber was Charles Martinet.
[16:47.62]What's with the fart music?
[16:48.62]It's Wario, dude.
[16:50.38]That's not true and false.
[16:51.90]Look it up.
[16:54.36]Alright, this is Mona.
[16:55.68]Work, school, and pets keep this high school student busy.
[16:58.15]She's also a big fan of Wario.
[16:59.75]Why?
[17:00.17]Who can say?
[17:03.03]Mona is always on the move, so you have to steer her in the right direction.
[17:06.35]The boomerang can be aimed the same way.
[17:10.50]You always are moving?
[17:11.40]Character.
[17:17.85]I don't like this character.
[17:24.09]Alright, this is weird.
[17:25.13]I feel like I'm patting my head and rubbing my stomach at the same time.
[17:30.11]This is very weird.
[17:31.15]This is strange.
[17:33.61]I get a raid?
[17:35.31]Oh shit, Kit Boga raid.
[17:37.81]You got a Kit Boga raid?
[17:39.39]This early?
[17:39.97]What's going on?
[17:42.63]Thanks, Kit.
[17:44.39]What's going on?
[17:44.85]Welcome, everybody.
[17:45.40]Welcome to the stream!
[17:50.33]If people are on my stream and you're not following Kitboga by now, like, you've lost your goddamn mind.
[17:57.79]Sing the rain song?
[17:58.45]No, I'm not going to sing a raid song.
[17:59.63]I'm going to do the impressions soon.
[18:03.27]YouTuber raid voice.
[18:04.65]This is not a YouTuber raid voice.
[18:06.89]What are you talking about?
[18:07.57]Look, when people hit the raid button, when you see the raid come in immediately, I can't just, like...
[18:16.54]I have to present myself in a way where I'm not a lunatic.
[18:22.34]Sing the raid song.
[18:25.66]On Almost just gave 20 community subs.
[18:27.56]Thank you.
[18:29.86]Kitbog is one of the funniest people on Twitch.
[18:33.88]Go follow.
[18:35.98]How do you not know who this person is by now?
[18:37.86]They're on the Dollhouse tree and they've got a thousand episodes.
[18:43.51]Thanks, Kit.
[18:43.89]Get him in.
[18:45.59]Let's keep going.
[18:50.10]Find the bag for your head.
[18:55.62]I will in a minute.
[18:56.42]I've been waiting for WarioWare for like the last fucking 25 years.
[19:02.02]What a mess.
[19:02.48]My level looks awful.
[19:04.23]Bugs inside the game.
[19:05.29]Who did this?
[19:06.23]Unacceptable.
[19:06.87]Let's go.
[19:07.23]Oh wait, you actually pick your character.
[19:12.09]Oh, I don't want to be that.
[19:12.69]I don't want to be Mono.
[19:14.17]I don't want to be that character.
[19:15.53]Who do I want to be?
[19:16.33]I think I'm going to be 18-volt.
[19:20.63]Oh no, you picked your crew!
[19:22.23]I just- okay.
[19:26.27]I don't- I'm- Wario's kinda hard.
[19:27.63]You can do an auto?
[19:33.74]That's probably cheating, right?
[19:37.60]Alright, here we go.
[19:37.98]You guys ready?
[19:39.54]Cutscene!
[19:40.08]Turn it off!
[19:43.17]Remember, you look like a hotter version of Ryan Reynolds.
[19:45.93]Don't give me that.
[19:47.27]Don't stroke my ego like that.
[19:48.47]That's completely false.
[19:49.67]That's 100% untrue.
[19:50.49]Why are you saying that?
[19:53.05]That's unbelievably false.
[19:57.84]That's not even remotely accurate.
[20:06.08]See?
[20:09.27]If I had to do that with the cam on, it's not going to happen.
[20:27.01]next day what these people are just up her house alright let's do it peel peel
[20:53.74]Whoa, I just barely got it.
[20:55.52]Alright, aim and throw.
[20:59.38]8 o'clock.
[20:59.66]Got it.
[21:00.34]Oh, look at that.
[21:03.04]I love that little guy over there.
[21:04.09]Yeah!
[21:04.95]Ring.
[21:05.57]Did I get it?
[21:23.88]I got it, right?
[21:26.92]I rang the doorbell.
[21:27.68]What?
[21:28.30]Hide.
[21:33.45]I rang the doorbell.
[21:40.77]He's so good.
[21:41.49]I just do it three times?
[21:43.61]Oh.
[21:52.43]Oh, that's hard.
[21:53.65]I got it.
[21:53.95]I got it.
[21:54.71]That's just one side?
[21:57.63]Okay, good.
[22:01.54]Shit, thank god.
[22:02.20]Watch out for the teeth.
[22:25.56]Okay, I'm good.
[22:26.48]Yeah.
[22:26.68]I don't know why I thought I was going to die.
[22:28.32]Oh, shit!
[22:29.44]I got it.
[22:30.06]I didn't even know where I was.
[22:32.08]Good thing I was flying around.
[22:36.22]Oh!
[22:52.98]This is weird to do.
[22:55.17]Okay, here we go.
[23:03.87]Hair dryer.
[23:04.99]Mega Man jug.
[23:06.13]Boots.
[23:06.71]Backpack.
[23:07.13]I need the Mega Man jug.
[23:14.41]I get it?
[23:16.73]Oh, shit.
[23:17.05]I got time here.
[23:22.47]Missing, um... Backpack!
[23:28.84]Bug!
[23:29.84]Oops.
[23:30.34]I was trying to kill the bug.
[23:31.42]Alright, I need, uh... Two of these.
[23:36.78]Yep.
[23:42.58]What the fuck?
[23:47.42]I need, uh... Two of these.
[23:48.94]I need one of these, and one of those.
[23:54.13]I wanna kill this bug!
[23:59.40]I wouldn't even hide!
[24:04.66]Remember, your hair looks good today.
[24:09.22]Can I please see my family?
[24:16.55]I need like a bag.
[24:18.89]Not even a bag, just like a towel or something.
[24:22.10]Or like a blanket to hide.
[24:26.16]All tidied up.
[24:26.90]Good work, everyone.
[24:27.68]A thousand coins.
[24:32.42]Alright, hold on.
[24:34.94]I'll be right back.
[24:36.86]I'm not leaving.
[24:37.44]I'll just be right back.
[24:39.14]Literally, just give me one second.
[24:41.60]One second.
[26:14.58]So, here.
[26:17.56]Let's see.
[26:18.53]Let's test this.
[26:23.09]So, if I was going to do Wario, right?
[26:24.51]I don't like people looking at me.
[26:34.60]Hey, it's a me.
[26:35.78]Wario.
[26:36.78]I hate it.
[26:39.46]Hey, it's me.
[26:41.28]No, I don't like when people look at me.
[26:44.63]Try this.
[26:49.08]Now you can't see me.
[26:51.28]So, like, I can do it.
[26:53.96]Ah, it's me, Wario.
[26:56.84]It's me, Wario.
[26:58.98]Ah, ah, ah, ah.
[27:00.92]Oh, here I go.
[27:02.15]Here I go.
[27:14.13]That was pretty good until I freaked out.
[27:17.69]How about Mr. Satan?
[27:18.59]I could do Mr. Satan, too.
[27:22.13]That is me, business.
[27:23.35]No, I don't want to do it in front of you.
[27:24.65]I'm going to do it.
[27:25.19]Fuck it, I'm going for it.
[27:25.95]Tell me which one's actually better.
[27:30.42]Well, that's me, Mr. Satan.
[27:31.94]How are you, Goku?
[27:33.48]Okay, right.
[27:34.70]Now let's try this.
[27:36.02]Tell me which one's really actually better.
[27:45.76]Well, that's how I do it, Goku.
[27:47.68]It's me, Mr. Satan.
[27:49.32]And I'm gonna tell you something.
[27:50.70]You're not gonna destroy Earth.
[27:52.38]I tell you, I'll kill you, Mr. Satan.
[27:54.58]Goku.
[27:56.28]It's constricting my blood vessels.
[27:59.39]It's constricting my blood vessels a little bit.
[28:01.21]I can't do it that well.
[28:04.19]Here's the difference.
[28:05.59]It feels like somebody's like, Alright, do some voices while I fucking do this.
[28:20.92]It's hard to do it with the mask on.
[28:24.38]The duck was, was the duck better?
[28:25.66]That was just Alex Jones.
[28:37.59]Was the duck actually better?
[28:38.77]I don't think it was because I was like constricted.
[28:40.53]Alright, how about this?
[28:42.92]Ready?
[28:49.60]Now I'm not constricted.
[28:53.20]Well, I'll tell you.
[28:55.67]It's me, Mr. Satan.
[28:57.21]And Goku has got himself in some trouble.
[28:59.75]We gotta go help him, Vegeta.
[29:02.81]Hey, it's me, Mr. Satan.
[29:04.75]We gotta help that Goku out because he's in big trouble.
[29:07.57]Which one was better?
[29:08.18]Okay, exactly.
[29:23.00]Can I just play this fucking goddamn game, please?
[29:26.34]Turn the camera off.
[29:31.53]You know that per- Why would I- Why am I doing this?
[29:36.37]I'm not sure.
[29:36.83]Maybe you should try the GIMP mask again.
[29:39.01]The GIMP mask?! !
[29:45.05]It's like a fucking turtle or whatever this thing is.
[29:47.79]I don't know what this is.
[29:49.02]It's like a duck or a chicken.
[29:51.12]What is this supposed to be?
[29:53.30]What is this creature?
[29:56.76]What is this?
[30:00.79]Is it a chicken?
[30:01.49]It's a rubber ducky.
[30:05.91]Oh, right.
[30:06.37]Yeah.
[30:08.03]It could be a turtle like this.
[30:16.94]Alright.
[30:21.22]Stop pretending.
[30:26.32]Alright, we got all the weird shit out of the way in this stream.
[30:28.31]We can go back to normal now.
[30:29.13]Alright, it's not so bad after all.
[30:35.41]Oh, Wario.
[30:36.27]How could you say that?
[30:50.78]Alright, let's do it.
[30:52.72]This taxi-driving duo is happy to take you from your front door to the far reaches of space.
[30:57.62]The fair is always fair.
[31:00.17]What's wrong with him today?
[31:01.19]I'm playing WarioWare for the first time in 10 years.
[31:04.77]I'm a little excitable.
[31:05.99]Alright, Dribble always fires his bazooka to the right, and Spitz always fires to his left.
[31:13.38]What if I'm playing with one person?
[31:24.31]How do I change?
[31:24.83]How do I switch person?
[31:32.14]Played this last year for the GameCube.
[31:35.16]But the game didn't come out last year for the GameCube?
[31:37.78]Alright, we took a look around and there are messes like this all over the place.
[31:44.86]Game bugs must have corrupted the entire game.
[31:48.91]Let's go exterminate some bugs then.
[31:53.55]Alright.
[31:56.64]I really like... I like 18-volt.
[31:59.50]I like cricket.
[32:00.04]I think those are my two mains.
[32:01.68]Dribble and... Oh.
[32:11.94]Stop tanking.
[32:17.93]Did you forget you played Smooth Moves?
[32:19.49]Yeah, but I've played these games before.
[32:21.27]They came out 10 years ago.
[32:22.94]This is a new one that I've never played before.
[32:25.04]I'm obviously going to be very excited.
[32:46.50]Close.
[32:47.38]Close.
[32:49.60]Holy shit.
[32:50.14]Okay, yeah.
[32:50.72]I didn't know if I had to shoot it.
[32:55.30]Spin it.
[32:55.80]Spin it.
[32:59.37]Literally best character in the game.
[33:04.05]Escape.
[33:06.17]Where the fuck am I?
[33:08.79]Nice.
[33:11.07]Made it.
[33:11.39]I got it, right?
[33:13.09]Okay, okay.
[33:14.93]Defeat.
[33:17.58]I can't even shoot that way.
[33:18.70]I got it, didn't I?
[33:20.34]Oh, I won.
[33:21.98]Okay.
[33:22.90]Cool.
[33:23.64]Put a jumpscare warning in the description when you're going to turn on the webcam.
[33:33.96]Why is my webcam so dark?
[33:46.11]Oh!
[33:53.12]Dodge, that's it?
[33:57.98]That was very easy.
[34:02.59]How many?
[34:03.23]One, two, three, four, five.
[34:04.53]Five!
[34:04.85]There are five.
[34:05.55]No, there are three!
[34:07.65]There are two!
[34:07.99]There's one!
[34:16.12]Okay.
[34:21.50]High five?
[34:25.02]Oh, shit!
[34:27.53]Uh, I'm gonna lose.
[34:31.85]Stick together.
[34:32.35]Why am I going like this?
[34:39.84]I'm like leaning back and free-
[34:43.88]You know what I'm doing?
[34:44.44]Like, why am I doing this?
[34:45.36]Lean in.
[34:45.62]It's not like a scary horror game.
[34:47.61]Catch four.
[34:48.23]One, two, three, four.
[34:52.49]I'm an overachiever, so therefore I get punished for it.
[34:59.54]Thanks, bro.
[35:00.34]I feel like it's going to be Wario and Cricket.
[35:07.29]Let's go.
[35:13.13]Alright, let's do it.
[35:13.71]Come on.
[35:22.44]Wario is actually pretty balanced.
[35:23.58]Oh!
[35:24.70]It's weird not being able to shoot that way.
[35:42.20]Stop, this isn't Smash.
[35:44.48]I'm not playing Smash.
[35:49.79]I got it.
[35:53.51]I got it.
[36:04.66]Fight me in Smash?
[36:05.32]Okay.
[36:05.48]Okay.
[36:12.56]Dodge!
[36:14.22]Oh calm down Drew.
[36:39.92]Is this game easier to play standing up?
[36:41.16]No, I don't think so.
[36:43.33]Where the fuck was the raid song?
[36:49.69]This is difficult.
[36:50.73]Okay, I got it.
[37:08.28]Raid songs from like 2019 guys.
[37:10.50]What do you want me to do?
[37:12.94]Oh shit, that's bad.
[37:17.02]One, two, three, four.
[37:22.66]It's from last year.
[37:23.76]It's from 2019.
[37:33.84]Protect this little guy?
[37:40.23]Ow.
[37:43.15]Am I protecting?
[37:48.07]Unlock?
[37:48.81]Oh shit.
[37:51.59]Get it!
[37:52.84]You piece of shit.
[37:53.90]Let him go.
[38:00.70]Unlock the fucking door.
[38:02.00]Get up there.
[38:08.74]Get up there!
[38:15.71]Oh my god.
[38:18.73]Let him go.
[38:19.17]That was tricky.
[38:25.43]You only shot him 34 times?
[38:29.32]That's fine.
[38:55.51]What can I do with money?
[38:56.27]I have a full drink here and I forgot it existed.
[38:59.54]That's good.
[39:01.60]Uh, Dr. Crygor?
[39:02.78]What's the drink?
[39:05.82]Um, it's Tang.
[39:24.28]I love dang.
[39:28.18]Am I swimming?
[39:28.70]Am I flying?
[39:29.36]Paddle, paddle, paddle.
[39:30.22]Look at my flippers go.
[39:31.26]Hello, Dr. Krygor.
[39:36.91]Indeed, what the gallium is going on around here.
[39:41.45]Dr. Krygor, down here.
[39:44.61]You literally live in the 90s.
[39:50.38]I don't.
[39:53.32]I have a tang over here.
[39:55.44]By the way, I do one scoop.
[39:58.81]I don't do the recommended two or three tablespoons.
[40:01.07]I do one tablespoon just to get a little flavor.
[40:04.57]It's barely anything in there.
[40:06.43]I like it.
[40:07.11]It tastes good.
[40:08.63]It's like a light little flavor.
[40:11.50]I don't recall my level looking like this at all.
[40:18.94]How many people are in the game?
[40:24.20]Oh, you're here too.
[40:24.88]Extraordinary.
[40:25.34]Yeah, by the way, that shit will last like a year if you do it like that.
[40:31.58]This genius scientist is so good at making mechanical marvels, he made a cyborg out of himself.
[40:35.94]Press or hold A to make Krygor swim through the air.
[40:41.71]Weird, okay.
[40:49.58]So you just kind of steer around.
[40:51.66]Ooh.
[40:52.64]Yeah, this is weird.
[41:00.57]I don't hate it, though.
[41:01.23]By part of the game, something's gone awry.
[41:10.23]Do you know what it might be?
[41:14.98]Game bugs have taken over.
[41:15.94]They're causing these glitches.
[41:21.53]Game bugs?
[41:22.03]Glitches?
[41:22.39]Wonderful.
[41:22.81]I shall be sure to study them in my laboratory.
[41:24.89]I think this guy has some glitches of his own, if you know what I mean.
[41:32.78]Okay.
[41:35.50]Wario and 18-volt.
[41:41.38]No, I'm not going to answer that question.
[41:43.96]That's weird.
[41:49.15]Handball.
[42:12.16]Let's go.
[42:46.02]Light.
[42:47.10]Cool.
[42:51.57]I like that one.
[42:51.95]That was fun.
[42:54.27]Are the emojis so large?
[42:55.13]I don't know what's going on.
[42:58.07]Pose.
[43:02.29]Oh, I have to get in frame?
[43:05.67]How do I escape?
[43:10.30]No, you idiot!
[43:13.20]Oh lord, I got it.
[43:13.82]A little wrong, but I got it.
[43:44.26]Nice.
[43:51.49]Shave your sides.
[43:56.79]Shave my sides.
[43:58.01]I haven't shaved in like a week.
[44:03.09]Oh, fuck.
[44:03.59]That was weird.
[44:04.17]That's weird with him.
[44:04.91]I get it?
[44:13.87]transport I thought I was like wait am I going the wrong way observe I just spammed I just I smashed that like button is what I did
[44:45.56]What am I supposed to do?
[44:48.30]Oh, that was easy.
[44:51.13]Clear a path.
[44:55.51]We're good.
[44:58.25]Remember, you contoured your beard.
[44:59.77]I didn't... That's just how my hair grows.
[45:01.91]I didn't contour.
[45:07.19]That's funny though.
[45:07.97]Grab.
[45:08.41]Okay.
[45:09.84]Assemble.
[45:19.33]Another sushi?
[45:21.67]I almost picked up the telephone.
[45:27.37]Okay, that was weird.
[45:28.27]It's toothpaste?
[45:30.11]It was very- that was simple.
[45:44.23]It's time for a full meltdown stream.
[45:46.97]I don't think so.
[45:47.63]I'm getting all the energy out in the beginning.
[45:48.99]In the first like 40 minutes of the stream.
[45:51.95]I'm just blowing through all my energy like in an hour.
[45:54.77]So don't worry.
[45:55.99]I'll fall asleep in like 25 minutes.
[46:02.84]See, I am a genius.
[46:10.78]You earned a thousand coins.
[46:15.27]Cool.
[46:15.75]Alright, so... I can only go here.
[46:20.41]Oh, Nintendo Classics is my favorite stuff.
[46:23.63]I love this shit.
[46:25.99]Are we gonna get to see Super Mario 1?
[46:28.26]Hopefully we get to see Super Mario 2.
[46:29.54]And I hope we get to see Zelda and Metroid.
[46:34.04]These are the best minigames.
[46:35.46]I've been waiting 10 years for these.
[46:42.13]All this pushing is good for my training, but can't you just walk a little bit?
[46:54.48]Yikes, 9-Volt.
[46:57.34]My skateboard, it's skating on its own.
[47:03.45]This skateboarding school kid is obsessed with Nintendo games and has some serious DJing and yo-yo skills.
[47:09.85]9-Volt's skateboard keeps him rolling back and forth.
[47:15.47]Press A to stop and shoot his yo-yo upwards so you don't even move.
[47:20.83]It's just yo-yo.
[47:27.62]Okay.
[47:28.32]It's weird, I don't control it.
[47:30.52]This one's gonna be hard.
[47:35.52]Okay, I can turn around.
[47:36.45]9-Volt is the only person that can make Nintendo fan games without getting a DMCA.
[47:59.36]That was pretty good.
[48:01.32]That was pretty good.
[48:01.90]I like that one.
[48:03.81]What's wrong with my level?
[48:04.61]Is it broken?
[48:05.29]Totally.
[48:07.37]There's these bugs in the game and they're chewing it all up.
[48:11.41]Okay, let's go get them.
[48:12.25]Nobody messes with my games.
[48:13.45]9 volt.
[48:17.78]Okay, 9 volt, 18 volt.
[48:21.10]Let's take Dr. Grigory.
[48:22.16]Let's go!
[48:36.23]Why is he not doing silly voices?
[48:39.75]You missed the first 20 minutes of the stream.
[48:41.81]That was pretty much the only thing we did.
[48:43.55]9 volts house.
[48:44.87]Epic augmented reality game.
[49:14.75]This is little dude.
[49:28.52]I used to watch wrestling like that.
[49:36.24]And I had this tiny little... I used to have in my bedroom this tiny little TV.
[49:41.57]It was an old CRT TV, so it was big, right?
[49:44.82]And I used to watch wrestling.
[49:46.56]Like Smackdown would be... What am I doing?
[49:48.16]What?
[49:51.18]So, it was Smackdown and Raw, it would be 10, 11, 12 o'clock, and I would have to go to bed.
[49:56.92]But I had to watch it on an old CRT TV, so I had plugged it into bed.
[50:02.97]Like, I plugged it into like the... Oh, let me pause this, because my brain can only do one thing at a time.
[50:07.25]So, I had a little CRT TV, it was like a big cube, it was a big Minecraft block, that's how I can describe it.
[50:12.65]So, it's plugged in far away.
[50:16.17]in my room.
[50:16.72]It's not right next to me.
[50:18.06]But what I used to do is when I wanted to watch wrestling late at night, I would plug the TV in behind, like, the bed, like, the outlet behind the bed, and the TV would be right on an end table right next to the bed, or I would be holding the TV in my bed.
[50:32.15]Just like this.
[50:34.02]With, like, fucking Stone Cold Steve Austin on it and shit.
[50:36.88]And I would hear the, like, here comes mom to check on you.
[50:41.09]And there would be two things I would do.
[50:42.87]I would, like, sometimes just, like, put it on the fucking ground next to me and, like, pretend to be asleep.
[50:47.39]Or, like, put it under the covers and, like, go like this.
[50:51.96]But I had this, like, gigantic, like, cube.
[50:54.78]Or I would try to turn with it, like, freak power off, turn it.
[50:58.73]It's like, I wonder how much my mother used to come in and be like, you stop watching TV.
[51:04.53]I know what you're doing.
[51:06.25]The TV is normally like across the whole fucking room.
[51:08.72]And you play, I'm like, no, I put it there before I went to bed.
[51:13.92]And I turned it off at exactly 10 p.m.
[51:16.12]like I'm supposed to because I'd be a good boy.
[51:17.48]It's like, oh, no, you didn't.
[51:20.64]Did it ever work?
[51:21.44]No, not once.
[51:26.59]I also, yeah, I think everybody that used to watch wrestling got in trouble watching TV in bed.
[51:33.24]See, you don't know how lucky you motherfuckers have it now.
[51:36.68]Do you understand me?
[51:37.54]Do you understand me?
[51:39.85]Do you know how hard it is?
[51:42.35]Do you know how easy it is for you to go like this?
[51:49.08]It was a cube and it weighed 40 pounds!
[51:52.30]And it was sitting on my chest!
[51:54.52]It was over the neck!
[51:55.46]Do you understand how hard it was?
[52:00.94]You guys even have brightness settings!
[52:02.72]You can go, oh, I'll turn the brightness down to zero so it makes like 10% illumination but I can still see.
[52:07.72]We didn't have that!
[52:08.42]You're lucky you didn't get your hands stuck in the VCR part of these TVs.
[52:13.33]The combos.

[71:36.00]Alright, boss battle.
[71:42.48]Are you going to be a dedicated Mass Effect 3 streamer?
[71:46.21]I cannot think of something that seems more torturing to do than... You want me to play Mass Effect 3 every stream?
[71:59.49]I mean, how many times can you truly play through that game?
[72:06.30]I suppose we did something.
[72:09.68]Oh, no.
[72:11.02]Who was there the most of?
[72:13.57]I don't know.
[72:14.19]I think it was the flamingo.
[72:15.01]Okay, if you like speedrunning Mass Effect, then sure, you're gonna do that.
[72:24.39]Who was not there?
[72:25.09]You weren't there.
[72:29.92]Just to simply be, I'm a Mass Effect 3 streamer?
[72:34.48]No speedruns?
[72:35.32]No, like, new DLC or anything?
[72:38.50]Who was in a pair?
[72:39.84]I don't know.
[72:40.16]I think it was this guy.
[72:42.06]No, what are you doing?
[72:46.03]There are multiple endings.
[72:47.97]I could see like streaming Mass Effect 3 for like a couple of weeks or something with like 100% of the game, right?
[72:53.10]But if I did Mass Effect 3 every day for like five years, Mass Effect 3, but I wasn't speedrunning it.
[73:02.36]Okay, we have lion with meat, jumping elephant, and sleeping gorilla.
[73:15.74]Question one.
[73:19.30]Who was not there?

[74:20.29]Mission complete.
[74:21.51]Alright, cool.
[74:22.55]I wonder what you actually buy weapons, dude.
[74:26.29]What do you spend money on?
[74:30.95]Oh, their names are Kat and Ana, like Katana.
[74:34.27]Yeah.
[74:36.13]It helps that they say it in the other game.
[74:40.85]Sports.
[74:42.41]Jimmy T.
[74:49.18]What's with this place?
[74:49.76]It's so dark and boring.

[75:21.99]There was a storyline.
[75:27.28]Alright, Jimmy, what do you got?
[75:34.58]Whether he's hitting the dance floor or the gym, the sports-loving Disco King has all the right moves.
[75:39.28]Okay, tilt to choose the direction of Jimmy's attack.
[75:49.23]This is kind of like Wario.
[75:50.35]This is Wario, but you can go in any direction.
[75:56.05]This is an upgraded Wario.
[76:00.15]Why would I use Wario?
[76:08.98]We can fix it, but we gotta take care of those bugs.
[76:19.06]Alright.
[76:20.00]I'm not going to pick Wario.
[76:23.91]Mike was good.
[76:25.47]And I'll do Mona too.
[76:26.61]Why not?
[76:28.29]And Dr. Crygor because I like him.
[76:31.65]Here's the cam.
[76:39.44]I turned the camera off for cutscenes.
[76:41.44]So I get out of the way so you can pay attention.
[77:01.80]This seems important.
[77:04.56]Alright.
[77:09.57]There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[77:13.27]There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[77:30.99]It really is.
[77:31.41]That's just... It's Milton right there.

[81:10.92]It's a boss level, not a normal level.
[81:14.08]They get harder though.
[81:16.08]Don't you go back and do that?
[81:21.06]I think you go back and you play these things again and they're like three times harder.
[81:24.18]Alright, here's Ashley.
[81:30.96]This is the Ashley.
[81:38.09]We can get a song.
[81:42.76]Kamehameha?
[81:49.14]What's the character's name?
[81:54.53]It's from Mario.
[82:10.56]The character from Mario the Wizard that has the same exact wand and the cubes.
[82:13.52]What's the character's name?

[85:20.61]For science.
[85:21.53]Faster.
[85:22.67]Chop, chop.
[85:25.01]Feed.
[85:26.39]Get it in there.
[85:31.07]Loss.
[85:31.97]Rattle.

[85:39.24]You bet.
[85:39.94]Blend.

[86:08.96]Oh shit, tanks.
[86:12.87]I didn't even pick up on that.
[86:14.35]This is very easy.
[86:18.21]I can't protect with- oh yeah I can.
[86:45.06]Alright, time for a boss battle.
[86:46.98]Oh, you're playing a kid's game.
[86:53.05]Okay.
[86:55.35]Would you like me to stop?
[86:56.29]Should I stop playing?
[86:58.99]Juice.
[87:04.32]Don't spill.
[87:05.18]Oh.
[87:05.46]I don't understand.
[87:12.77]Do I need to fill each one of these slots?
[87:20.34]Oh, I need to juice it!
[87:21.46]Actually, physically smash it.
[87:22.62]Okay.
[87:26.18]Why is that meter doing that?
[87:44.91]That's... I'm fine.
[87:46.53]That was easy.
[87:52.90]Everybody's a kid at heart.
[88:00.04]Before you retire, Jerma, please do a full beard.
[88:03.79]I can't.
[88:04.27]This looks like I have wires hanging out of my face.
[88:13.70]The hairs are so individually spaced out that it just looks strange.
[88:20.72]After another two weeks of this, it looks bizarre.
[88:23.10]Alright, I got ten, almost ten thousand bucks.
[88:34.06]Orbulon.
[88:39.67]Strange beards are cool.
[88:42.32]I mean, maybe.
[88:42.90]I don't like the way it looks.
[88:48.19]What's that weird sound?
[88:50.81]Some people can pull off beards.
[88:52.07]Some people can just pull off a strange-looking beard.
[88:55.27]I'm not one of them.
[88:58.76]Plus, it's itchy and annoying.
[89:08.64]I hate it.
[89:09.36]I don't like the way a beard feels.
[89:12.84]Let's try to turn the camera off.
[89:14.26]This alien insists he'll invade Earth one day.
[89:16.91]He's lived here long enough to know a lot about our culture.
[89:21.57]Morbulon sucks up the things below him by activating his beam.
[89:25.27]Okay, weird.
[89:28.83]Beam up.
[89:30.47]Whoa.
[89:37.99]I like this character a lot.
[89:42.36]My beam of tractoring, it does not work on this glitchy yuck.
[89:47.06]Stuff won't go away until we take out those mean old game bugs.
[89:50.50]I see.
[89:52.20]I see, then Orbulon will dispose of these bugs with style.
[89:54.82]Alright, we're doing Ashley, and Ashley, Jimmy, and Kicker.
[90:02.94]That's good.
[90:04.76]Do the mustache?
[90:08.26]I did a mustache for the one scream, and I couldn't do it again.
[90:18.97]I already like this music the most.
[90:34.30]When are you going to play Mass Effect 3 Alternate Appearance Pack DLC 1?
[90:39.22]What a living hell.
[90:55.00]That would be my stream title too.
[90:57.30]Checking out the huge new update.
[91:03.14]Commander Shepard has a green shirt this time.
[91:11.21]The developer studio t-shirt.
[91:14.77]Make it flow.
[91:17.84]Commander Shepard with like the game studio t-shirt that you can put on.
[91:26.68]Match?
[91:27.44]I don't know what happened.
[91:29.68]Sorry.
[91:30.70]Guys, I can't even stream the same game like two or three times.
[91:42.04]It was a Christmas miracle that I was able to stream and play and make videos of TF2 for as long as I did.
[91:50.31]That's the only exception ever.
[91:53.81]Take a peek.
[91:57.94]Ice cream.
[91:59.19]Oh shit.
[92:00.35]Was there a spoon in it?
[92:01.37]No.
[92:05.05]I just got burnt.
[92:09.23]What happened?
[92:10.21]Oh, whatever.
[92:12.39]Alright.
[92:16.78]I didn't get it for a second, but now I do.
[92:20.54]Alright.
[92:26.93]Ring the bell!
[92:28.41]Ring the bell, what the fuck?
[92:32.57]Got it.
[92:44.78]Oh, do it!
[92:45.44]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[92:49.54]Get moving!
[93:14.24]I love these ones.
[93:14.90]Come on, get over there.
[93:15.64]I love when you mix the colors together.
[93:22.47]Don't waste any money.
[93:24.27]What's the point?
[93:27.99]This team might not be very good either.
[93:29.61]Shit.
[93:33.64]Okay, I got it.
[93:37.98]You're a sad little man.
[93:41.78]Time it.
[94:01.94]Alright, nice, I got it!
[94:22.81]I'm gonna steal your bread if you don't tell me your skincare routine.
[94:28.48]It's called turn the shower on.
[94:31.10]Put your shampoo in your head.
[94:33.98]And then go like this.
[94:38.93]And like get it all over like everywhere.
[94:41.63]Make sure your eyes are closed.
[94:50.38]Your mouth is closed.
[94:58.33]Oh, this one sucks.
[94:59.11]Okay, I got it.
[95:01.33]You just shampoo, shampoo, shampoo, and then you go after the shampoo runs dry, right?
[95:04.79]When it runs out and it runs clear.
[95:07.11]Just hold your face up to the, um... Hold your face up to the shower and just go like this.
[95:14.39]You distracted me and it caused a problem.
[95:26.74]Do it!
[95:30.91]No, you just use, like, Cetaphil.
[95:33.07]You're fine.
[95:36.05]Just use, like, a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil.
[95:38.50]That's all you have to do.
[95:49.18]35 in one shampoo.
[95:55.06]35 in one shampoo would be you brush your teeth too.
[95:58.32]Hold on.
[95:59.30]Wait, wait, wait.
[95:59.72]We got to talk about that.
[96:00.94]Let him pass.
[96:01.54]Come on in.
[96:06.00]Imagine putting shampoo in your hair, letting it run down into your mouth and brushing your teeth with it.
[96:13.35]And then it keeps going down and you put it under your armpits and it's a deodorant.
[96:19.76]Did I just kill somebody?
[96:21.40]What happened?
[96:26.31]What was that?
[96:29.19]Let him through.
[96:29.87]Let it pass.
[96:52.31]Oh, okay.
[96:53.03]I get it.
[96:53.37]They were gonna crash into each other!
[97:03.44]I got something in my nose.
[97:14.61]Ah!
[97:21.14]Oh my god, there's like a good animal in here.
[97:26.25]Ah!
[97:30.27]What do I do?
[97:30.65]But they're gonna crash into each other.
[97:35.07]It's like, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out!
[97:46.36]Why would it tell?
[97:47.56]Why will it?
[97:48.28]Why would it tell me that?
[97:51.82]There is a beam that's like, caution, caution, caution, oncoming car, caution, caution, caution.
[97:59.36]Why is there a caution?
[98:10.25]If I'm driving on one side of the road, I don't get a bunch of caution signs.
[98:16.71]It says, watch out, another car is on the other side of the road.
[98:21.74]What's the caution for?
[98:22.56]Get out of here!
[98:40.17]Get away from me!
[99:06.10]Last one.
[99:06.68]I'm not gonna watch it.
[99:12.64]Get the animal out of your nose.
[99:20.33]I will eventually.
[99:32.13]Do a pee break?
[99:35.87]Yeah, I will in like 15 minutes.
[99:38.72]At the two-hour mark, we'll do a first break.
[99:41.00]I'm fine.
[99:45.20]Conquer the game, bugs, then conquer the world.
[99:47.12]Thank you, Segata, for the 10 community subs.
[99:51.01]I missed a bunch of other subs, too.
[99:52.17]We were in the middle of ranting.
[99:52.99]Ranting and raving.
[99:58.11]But thanks.
[99:58.65]Thanks to subs.
[99:59.65]Thanks to 10 community subs.
[100:01.17]I believe this is Remix 2.
[100:14.85]Two hours drink.
[100:15.63]I've got... I've got a drink right here.
[100:17.73]I'm good.
[100:18.83]This is full of water and a little bit of tank.
[100:22.25]I'm hydrating.
[100:23.55]I'm good.
[100:28.04]Another minecart.
[100:29.15]I'm gonna take Orbulon, I like him.
[100:33.11]Do you like the game so far?
[100:34.07]I do, but so far it's very easy.
[100:37.51]I think I'm gonna eat those words, but it's very simple so far, very easy.
[100:41.47]Really hoping that it gets much more challenging in the near future.
[100:44.35]I remember Smooth Moves, some of those remixes were insane.
[100:57.65]Yeah, I think it's going to be hard.
[100:59.63]I know it is.
[101:04.77]Unacceptable.
[101:05.45]You know better than to wander off by yourself.
[101:06.97]It's not safe.
[101:09.03]Oh my, getting upset makes me so sleepy.
[101:14.80]Like, what's up with your mom and your other mom?
[101:17.28]She has these out-of-body experiences, I guess.
[101:22.40]Your mom's got spooky moves.
[101:23.72]Hey, that's weird.
[101:24.32]I dig it.
[101:28.94]This is, yeah.
[101:57.68]I think I'll get used to it, and then I'll probably end up liking it.
[102:03.91]We'll see.
[102:08.17]She can't move.
[102:08.79]There's no jump or anything.
[102:10.07]Just teleport.
[102:12.85]Alright, we're going to get the cup scene here.
[102:15.60]I don't want to just use the overpowered characters.
[102:21.02]Let's go with Mike and Wario.
[102:23.30]And 18 volts.
[102:23.72]You can't just use the OP characters every time.
[102:30.86]Oh shit, there's no cutscene.
[102:32.56]No cutscene.
[102:34.62]Oh, did I fuck it up?
[102:36.96]I think I broke it.
[102:39.78]I got it.
[102:41.30]She's not... She's actually pretty good.
[102:46.34]Dodge.
[103:07.24]Does that count?
[103:11.59]How do you jump through when you have a teleport?
[103:14.13]What?
[103:14.73]I can't.
[103:19.45]There's no jump through.
[103:20.65]Oh.
[103:38.07]I like not having to move.
[103:40.87]Shit, too much.
[103:42.51]Okay, we're good.
[103:43.65]Why do I sound like Patrick?
[103:47.45]I do sound like Patrick.
[104:11.54]Alright, speed up.
[104:13.93]Get to the green.
[104:15.73]Oh, yeah.
[104:17.23]Happy to.
[104:22.79]Steep.
[104:26.11]Ow.
[104:26.73]Oh.
[104:28.49]She's weird.
[104:29.21]She's weird to use.
[104:30.41]Remove.
[104:32.11]Oh, yeah.
[104:33.27]Cross.
[104:40.13]It does sound like Patrick.
[104:42.85]I'm a master.
[104:43.61]Alright, here we go.
[104:47.10]What's her boss?
[104:48.92]I'm not more of this juicing shit.
[104:55.78]I can't even talk.
[105:11.70]I don't want to do the juicing.
[105:15.20]This actually kind of sucks with her.
[105:20.80]Drop the bee!
[105:30.33]Missing a blot.
[105:31.25]No!
[105:44.33]Oh, we're at critical levels of... That shit's moving around.
[105:47.69]And that's it, right?
[106:08.39]That's hard with her.
[106:09.31]It's weird.
[106:09.79]Alright, come on.
[106:11.29]Let's go.
[106:11.59]Let's go.
[106:11.85]Let's go.
[106:12.09]This is it.
[106:21.45]I think I figured out the strat, though.
[106:25.57]Yeah, I gotta- He's gonna wait till there's two over- Don't- Stop!
[106:57.65]No!
[106:58.23]Fuck!
[107:01.62]No!
[107:03.24]No!
[107:05.22]God damn it!
[107:11.48]My last try.
[107:12.57]Last attempt.
[107:17.35]I just watched your Thanksgiving dinner stream.
[107:20.53]It was a while ago.
[107:23.11]That's like one of my favorite streams.
[107:25.85]That polarized the community so much.
[107:29.87]That's some people's least favorite thing I've ever done and some people's most favorite thing I've ever done.
[107:36.67]People genuinely hated that stream and they were like, don't fucking do that shit.
[107:40.17]I hated it.
[107:40.61]I was like, alright.
[107:53.42]I would do it again, too.
[107:58.10]It's my last chance, seriously.
[108:02.52]I got stung by the bee?!
[108:06.00]What?!
[108:06.42]I didn't think that was even possible!
[108:12.45]I'm spending a hundred fucking coin packs and I'm going again.
[108:29.20]POP IT!
[108:32.48]I'm not gonna scream, but what am I, fucking ten?
[109:16.97]That's it.
[109:17.23]Okay, game over.
[109:17.69]I win.
[109:28.12]No, the meter is going so high!
[109:36.17]Game too hard?
[109:36.89]Game is not too hard.
[109:46.65]You haven't seen Hard yet.
[109:49.99]That's coming up pretty soon.
[109:51.35]How many more characters are they gonna introduce in the game?
[110:01.42]Let me see, go back and play the old levels.
[110:09.28]I'm curious.
[110:12.35]Let's see.
[110:14.09]So if I go back to, let's say... Alright, like Dr. Crygor, right?
[110:18.59]What happens?
[110:23.99]Yeah, I've already seen this.
[110:28.03]So what happens if I play this again?
[110:43.22]After this, you should play one of the other make a match.
[110:52.19]Oh shit.
[110:54.01]Can I grow back?
[111:08.51]I used to play Rhythm Heaven.
[111:09.53]I played it.
[111:10.63]It's one of my favorite games.
[111:12.17]Look, green, green, purple.
[111:14.33]Hop on.
[111:15.38]Huh?
[111:18.56]I wasn't paying attention.
[111:23.08]Alright, I'm good.
[111:40.67]I gotta get at least 20 to 30 on every level.
[111:43.13]I like that video.
[111:44.39]Partizan, that one.
[112:06.09]What?
[112:06.73]Thought it was a spade.
[112:10.27]Wasn't it a spade?
[112:14.57]Fuck, I'm confused.
[112:17.43]Alright, 11.
[112:18.01]I gotta get to at least level 20.
[112:25.29]Or 30.
[112:25.43]Or 50.
[112:25.55]Okay.
[112:45.46]Clear screen?
[112:50.54]A pop-up ad?
[112:51.30]What was that?
[112:51.78]Oh, I'm at the boss stage.
[112:54.24]What the heck?
[112:56.92]Can we keep going after this?
[113:06.49]This game looks fun.
[113:10.29]It is fun.
[113:13.76]I think we keep going after this.
[113:16.87]Okay, so does it keep going?
[113:20.43]Yep, it does.
[113:20.89]Bonus stage.
[113:42.01]Oh, wait.
[113:42.41]11,000.
[113:44.05]Oh, it's just a collect game?
[113:48.14]No, we keep going.
[113:49.02]That's right.
[113:49.72]I knew it.
[113:50.06]Okay.
[114:17.22]What did it explode?
[114:22.04]What did it explode for?
[114:24.08]I lost.
[114:24.56]Now I'm paying some fucking in-game currency.
[114:27.92]I'm paying in-game currency.
[114:29.58]Oh, I can't.
[114:34.59]I'll go back to it.
[114:40.99]Wario.
[114:48.89]Now we're getting somewhere.
[114:49.55]This is the last level I made.
[114:51.01]This is the story mode, guys.
[114:52.79]There's like a ton of shit to do.
[114:55.23]There's much corruption here.
[114:56.77]A great amount of much.
[115:00.13]What is that thing?
[115:13.06]It's taking over my game.
[115:14.18]We've got to stop it.
[115:16.99]There's four more characters.
[115:18.07]Yeah, what are you guys doing?
[115:19.01]This is just like the little story mode.
[115:20.21]They get you tutorial to get you going.
[115:25.10]Alright, it's five people.
[115:26.30]Morbulon, Mike, Ashley, 18 volt, and five volt for the wild card.

[116:59.66]What the f- I had to pull it?
[117:01.20]I was trying to pull the damn thing.
[117:06.56]This is an awful character to have.
[117:08.52]This character is not good.
[117:09.66]That was a very bad character. 314.
[117:19.45]Is murder legal in the Mario universe?

[118:12.98]Pop.
[118:13.46]Good.
[118:13.92]So, back at you.
[118:22.01]She's really good, actually.
[118:27.29]That's really good.
[118:28.77]Oh, alright.
[118:49.22]get this out of here this guy sucks the one thing he was good for was right there oh
[119:21.41]There we go.
[119:39.78]Which one travels in the ocean?
[119:43.85]Whatever.
[119:45.59]It's too much for my brain.
[119:47.57]No, I don't want this guy for the boss stage.
[119:53.72]Maybe I do.
[119:54.16]Um, what?
[119:58.92]Oh, I was saying what happened?
[120:01.41]Go!
[120:28.15]What?
[120:28.51]Oh, it's on a rock that can break.
[120:30.11]Did I do it?
[120:51.83]He's so- I hate this guy!
[121:08.16]Alright, there we go.
[121:09.12]Okay, alright.
[121:10.04]Finally.
[121:10.50]This is gonna be so much easier with this character.
[121:22.08]That's so much better.
[121:22.90]This is simple.
[121:25.72]I can literally just go to the edge of the screen and press A. Okay.
[121:38.68]That was much easier.
[121:39.46]Here we go.
[121:48.91]Just dodge it and watch out for the rocks.
[121:52.61]The wind, be careful.
[121:53.63]Capture.
[121:56.23]Capture.
[121:56.65]I'm hurt.
[121:57.13]Fire it up!
[121:58.03]I don't know how to describe right now.
[122:01.94]Chase.
[122:24.84]It's his capture and then points it with the thing.
[122:26.92]I thought I had to catch the damn thing.
[122:28.66]I don't have to destroy them.
[122:52.78]Okay, alright.
[122:54.88]Let's go.
[122:56.08]Okay, capture!
[123:26.65]That's it?
[123:29.85]That's such a bait.
[123:32.57]I like the toilet character though.
[123:38.57]That was cool.
[124:01.52]Wario, anything goes.
[124:03.16]I just beat the tutorial.
[124:09.80]This is where it gets a little bit more tricky.
[124:17.44]I have to get at least 25 on most of the levels of my choosing.
[124:23.96]By most, I mean three.
[124:27.44]And by three, I mean one.
[124:31.11]And by one, I mean I'll see you tomorrow.
[124:37.51]I need to get at least 25 on the remixes.
[124:40.83]At least 50 on one remix.
[124:48.06]I gotta get at least 50 on one remix.
[124:49.50]Oh, it's a party.
[124:59.53]Ah.
[125:01.35]I am the supreme developer.
[125:04.41]I watch over this game, you might say.
[125:06.91]I'm the one who brought you here.
[125:08.09]Yes, that was all me.
[125:09.97]What?
[125:11.37]Not supreme who.
[125:12.16]Come on, everyone knows Wario's number one.
[125:16.14]The game bugs arrive quite uninvited.
[125:18.82]Almost as uninvited as your parent doing Wario reading a book with Wario in it to their three-year-old son or daughter.
[125:26.41]I knew not what to do, so I brought you here to help.
[125:30.53]Time to shuffle on out of here Come back and play anytime
[125:52.43]Oh, that's it.
[125:54.63]Oh, here's the ending cutscene.
[125:56.59]No, I'm not done.
[125:57.16]I'm not done.
[125:58.48]I want to get at least like 30 or 40 or 50 on some of these.
[126:02.58]I want to dial it up.
[126:03.34]I want to get intense.
[126:04.62]That was the tutorial.
[126:09.25]We make games, I make money.
[126:38.34]Wario programs with JavaScript.
[126:41.88]Someone's missing.
[126:44.68]Who's missing?
[126:45.44]Oh no.
[126:49.36]We must rescue them.
[126:56.68]Meh.
[127:08.32]It's not over.
[127:15.16]This was just the beginning.
[127:20.01]Alright, 1,000 coins.
[127:20.73]Very cool.
[127:24.03]Ooh.
[127:24.99]You now can watch the end anytime.
[127:26.99]You unlocked a variety pack in the main menu.
[127:30.85]Alright.
[127:35.30]New.
[127:40.15]Is this the scary mode?
[127:42.49]It looks like it.
[127:45.33]All mixed up.
[127:47.91]I'm gonna do this one and then I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
[127:51.05]And I'm gonna blow my nose.
[127:58.40]You've returned and so soon.
[127:59.76]Welcome.
[128:02.66]Seems some of our friends are still stuck inside the game.
[128:05.73]Three of our friends.
[128:06.45]You gotta help us.
[128:07.95]Yes, of course.
[128:08.67]I shall check.
[128:11.12]Hmm, yes, strange.
[128:11.95]It appears they have been captured by something.
[128:15.89]Oh, come on.
[128:16.23]I thought we took care of the game bugs.
[128:18.49]This is not the work of a game bug.
[128:19.73]Wait, oh dear.
[128:20.77]One of you friends is nearby.
[128:21.97]Alright, something tells me they're in this tower.
[128:25.57]Time to boogie.
[128:33.38]Someone, anyone help!
[128:38.12]Red, what have you done now?
[128:40.74]Ashley, I knew you'd come to rescue you, little old me.
[128:45.08]Red.
[128:46.04]Sometimes he seems to be more scaredy cat than demon.
[128:48.92]Still, Red takes good care of his fave witch, Ashley.
[128:56.53]The bombs?
[129:00.15]It's a little weird.
[129:00.77]I kind of like it, though.
[129:04.47]There's a delay.
[129:05.17]There's a delay on them.
[129:07.43]Cool.
[129:14.29]See where this big thing went.
[129:15.41]Pretty sure it took this elevator up to floor 18.
[129:17.79]Okay.
[129:19.55]Do we have this more people to unlock?
[129:25.30]Alright.
[129:26.76]Obi-Lan.
[129:28.40]Mike.
[129:30.06]Ashley.
[129:31.16]Okay.
[129:32.40]Let's go.
[129:34.58]Simple with this guy.
[129:49.30]Oh, get out of the way.
[130:09.55]I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it.
[130:14.74]Oh, you don't?
[130:16.86]Ooh, that was embarrassing.
[130:19.58]It was very embarrassing.
[130:20.30]I thought I had to connect it to the left side.
[130:22.20]I thought I had to connect it to the left side.
[130:23.50]It was embarrassing.
[130:25.08]It's fine.
[130:25.38]Ooh, he got out of the fucking way.
[130:30.06]It's a frog with a frog.
[130:33.92]I love that guy.
[130:36.00]Why can't that be a WarioWare character?
[130:48.64]Was that technically a goal?
[130:49.84]I don't think so.
[131:01.55]No, get under the tongue.
[131:04.03]Get under the tongue!
[131:06.45]These are hard.
[131:08.17]It's so... Oh!
[131:08.85]Alright, I'm fine.
[131:13.45]This is gonna be hard.
[131:19.33]Cool car.
[131:20.65]Give me a fucking break.
[131:49.53]Five.
[131:49.97]I'm so proud of that.
[131:51.51]Five.
[131:52.37]I know that.
[131:57.17]That is it.
[131:58.17]Did I do it?
[132:03.43]I did it.
[132:06.18]Alright, time to pee.
[132:20.09]I wanna pee.
[132:21.52]Right after this cutscene.
[132:23.02]What the heck?
[132:25.68]That thing jumped out the window from floor 18!
[132:27.08]It dropped something.
[132:29.40]What's in there?
[132:31.66]Golden Beehive.
[132:34.13]Treasure.
[132:35.47]We must not lose focus.
[132:36.43]I forgot I still had that emote.
[132:40.19]We must not lose focus.
[132:41.19]Time to rescue the other two.
[132:43.15]Alright, I gotta pee.
[132:48.38]I'll be right back.
[132:51.70]See you in a second.
[135:14.07]Okay, hello.
[135:16.63]I'm trying to come back a little quieter nowadays.
[135:19.89]Is the compressor on my mic when I come back?
[135:22.23]I'm just... Loud, here I am.
[135:24.55]I feel like I scared the shit out of people.
[135:25.71]Alright, we got a super hard.
[135:37.50]Super hard.
[135:40.01]I feel like this is going to get impossible, but whatever.
[135:41.81]I'm doing a lot of dancing today and moving around.
[135:58.04]I feel like I have to do that when I play these games.
[136:01.42]Whenever I have the two Joy-Cons in both hands like this, I need to be moving.
[136:09.03]Because I feel like I'm not connected.
[136:12.08]This keeps me like sane.
[136:15.24]Having to go like this.
[136:16.88]When you let me go like this, I'm just like, I can move around.
[136:20.62]I can do anything I want.
[136:21.74]I need to be like held down like this.
[136:24.96]Look at him.
[136:25.52]Look at him go.
[136:27.25]I'm tired of waiting and fell asleep.
[136:28.63]What do you got?
[136:37.91]Mantis is a master jumper.
[136:39.51]He's so good he can jump onto the ceiling and walk around up there.
[136:41.97]I don't want to use this guy.
[136:49.38]This is weird.
[136:57.70]Untethered.
[137:02.51]Super hard.
[137:03.13]Let's go.
[137:03.69]How many do I need? 18?
[137:06.23]Floor 10?
[137:06.99]That's it?
[137:10.49]Only floor 10?
[137:11.09]It seems like it's gonna be simple.
[137:13.81]Nope.
[137:14.01]It's fast, but I only did 10.
[137:41.28]I can definitely get 30 or 40 at least on one of these.
[137:48.75]Oh, take it out!
[137:51.73]Oh!
[137:52.91]Okay, seek shelter.
[138:08.26]I'm fine.
[138:08.76]Stop overreacting.
[138:09.90]Stop overreacting.
[138:11.09]Why am I acting like that?
[138:12.27]Because the camera's on and I'm trying too hard.
[138:16.47]I'm trying too hard because the camera's on.
[138:31.53]See, I have the reverse problem when I play games.
[138:33.69]Okay, instead of voice impressions, if the camera's off, I can do voices better, right?
[138:37.89]But when the camera's on, I have this, like, obligation to overact.
[138:42.21]You know what I mean?
[138:43.09]Like, I don't do that when the camera's off.
[138:46.73]Like, oh, something crazy just happened.
[138:48.39]Whoa!
[138:49.53]Whoa!
[138:51.23]Why am I doing that?
[138:52.11]I don't do that in real life.
[138:54.36]I'm, like, doing, like, a tuba react because I know you're looking at me.
[138:59.10]Okay, toilet paper roll.
[139:06.11]Although actually some of it's real.
[139:07.83]Most of it's real.
[139:08.83]That's actually a pretty cool treasure.
[139:14.23]Streamer syndrome.
[139:21.50]Digging in the ground.
[139:22.74]It's actually all real.
[139:29.76]But here's the thing, like, okay, so I go like, what the fuuuck?
[139:34.78]Like, I have to go harder.
[139:35.74]Because I see myself over here in the preview.
[139:38.46]So it starts off as a normal, like, fuck.
[139:41.60]It's like, I look over, it's like, fuck.
[139:45.02]But I have to go harder.
[139:45.80]Because I'm like, oh, that's not good enough.
[139:47.68]I gotta go harder than that.
[139:52.02]Real ride.
[140:02.50]Block that part of the preview.
[140:04.74]It's so small.
[140:05.64]I can't even like see it.
[140:06.72]Please don't scream.
[140:15.25]I'm trying to sleep.
[140:21.05]We talked about this last week, but it's like when the mirror is there, I just have to stare at it.
[140:25.01]I can't help it.
[140:25.55]I just like, oh, what would I look like today?
[140:28.19]We already did this joke a week ago.
[140:31.75]Press A to make Lulu float upwards.
[140:33.55]She can perform a ground pound from mid-air.
[140:35.95]Okay.
[140:40.33]How many times can I do it?
[140:42.88]Doesn't go all the way down.
[140:46.50]I don't like it.
[140:51.62]All these new characters I don't like.
[140:52.92]Except for the bomb guy.
[140:53.66]The narcissist in the pond?
[141:01.55]What's the narcissist in the pond?
[141:03.01]Is that like a story?
[141:03.99]Only four of five.
[141:08.47]They're making this easier and easier.
[141:24.22]Eyes from staring at their own reflection.
[141:25.86]Escape.
[141:43.93]That was 11.
[141:44.39]Good.
[141:44.67]Bomb is perfect there.
[141:46.60]Good.
[141:48.18]Hey, Swiglo, thanks for the five.
[141:55.56]Give me underneath up.
[142:15.95]Alright, so obviously I have to go through these.
[142:18.57]Once I unlock everything.
[142:19.55]There's only one life?
[142:30.24]Yeah, we only have five levels though.
[142:31.14]That's not hard.
[142:34.91]You don't know Boppities and you don't know Narcissus.
[142:45.95]Put all the treasure together.
[142:46.79]Okay, how are we supposed to put all this junk together?
[142:51.47]Beehive, toilet paper, mug.
[142:56.52]What does that do?
[142:59.90]Alright, let's see if even my granddaughter Penny can be of assistance.
[143:06.51]Mario has a granddaughter?
[143:11.79]Can't wait to see what happens next.
[143:21.80]I thought that was the Grinch.
[143:24.22]It's not the Grinch.
[143:25.12]That's a different character entirely.
[143:26.57]Okay.
[143:28.31]Penny's Mix.
[143:29.87]Alright, then I'll give Penny a call.
[143:53.08]I give you Jet Tank 1.
[144:08.76]Mario did this.
[144:11.68]Mario did this already.
[144:14.18]Try harder next time.
[144:36.91]And you shrunk yourself down to like go into the thing, into the game.
[144:40.57]Osmosis Jones did that 15 years ago.
[144:42.41]Be better at everything you do.
[144:50.86]Tilt to aim Penny's water blast with the recoil mover in the opposite direction of the water.
[144:54.16]Okay.
[144:57.38]Move here.
[145:01.64]Oh boy.
[145:02.32]Okay.
[145:02.84]It's a continuous spray.
[145:05.14]And I can hover.
[145:07.91]I got the webcam on, and I definitely looked crazy right there.
[145:10.63]I was just like, this is why I don't have the webcam on.
[145:22.74]She's hard to use.
[145:42.42]Oh, Ashley did this like fucking 10 years ago.
[145:44.76]That's how you guys treat me.
[145:51.02]It's hard.
[146:00.11]Flip.
[146:15.66]Blend it out.
[146:17.84]Yeah!
[146:20.22]It's like I'm watching the outro to half the animes I've seen.
[146:42.96]Everyone's like happy.
[146:43.96]Everyone's like walking down sidewalks together.
[146:45.78]They're getting food.
[146:48.24]They're taking like pictures of each other and stuff.
[146:59.03]They all have backpacks.
[147:01.09]And they're all very happy to be wherever they are.
[147:16.82]Slice of life, Andy.
[147:18.78]Slice of life, Andy.
[147:40.22]I want to do this with like x10 speed when we eventually play this.
[147:46.84]Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
[148:00.01]No, I miss it.
[148:00.65]I want it back.
[148:03.21]Alright, solve this for us, please.
[148:22.24]Watering can.
[148:24.89]Golden watering can.
[148:26.63]Toilet.
[148:30.65]If that turns into a sunflower, it's going to be pretty pog.
[148:58.70]Golden watering can has fulfilled its duty.
[149:00.62]It's gone.
[149:01.64]My treasure.
[149:02.08]My beautiful treasure.
[149:02.80]Getting a little crowded up here.
[149:07.88]Where's that cat over there?
[149:13.64]Have I seen that character?
[149:22.06]New.
[149:22.56]Okay, you can watch Calling Penny anytime now.
[149:27.00]And now...
[149:29.95]breached the showdown.
[149:38.17]Who actually rewatches the cutscenes?
[149:39.81]Yeah, I don't, but... Do you think you missed something?
[149:46.44]I don't know.
[149:50.36]Alright.
[149:51.78]What have we got?
[149:52.40]This thing that's been jumping through the windows.
[149:56.15]There it is.
[149:56.55]That's the thing that kidnapped me.
[150:00.78]Does it have more treasure?
[150:02.22]Wait, come back.
[150:05.23]Gonna get a final cutscene?
[150:10.05]Don't.
[150:11.87]I'm just going.
[150:13.55]Defeat it.
[150:14.73]Round one.
[150:34.65]Well, it's a continuous jump!
[150:36.07]It's... I can't... Okay.
[150:42.31]Come on, lift up!
[150:43.82]Oh, I can't wait to do this one.
[150:50.94]And this one is unlocked and I can just keep going, like, round 100.
[151:08.10]I tried to make it all four Alright, I'm good
[151:47.34]I forget what some of these characters do.
[151:48.46]Sorry, I'm concentrating.
[152:23.03]Oh shit!
[152:23.75]Did I get it?
[152:32.18]Alright.
[152:32.92]Nice.
[152:33.30]Oh no, not yet.
[152:35.68]I'm spending the coins.
[153:00.71]Have I unlocked the whole game?
[153:01.78]God, no.
[153:02.20]Never.
[153:02.54]No.
[153:02.64]I would do that for two days and think it was fun or funny and I would never want to be on set ever again.
[153:11.26]Is that a new character?
[153:31.86]It's Pyoro, star of that super popular game.
[153:35.58]Pyoro.
[153:37.09]What are you doing in our game?
[153:41.25]Stop by to play for a little bit.
[153:44.35]I love him.
[153:44.93]And oh, he wants to know, do you have a good time playing with me?
[153:49.76]Good time?

[153:50.48]Who cares?
[153:50.84]Where's the treasure?
[153:51.56]Oh, there's gotta be a treasure.
[153:55.08]Some gold maybe?
[153:55.68]Just a teensy bit?
[153:59.22]You're kidding.
[154:01.33]No, there's nothing at all, but I can't end like this.
[154:03.25]Hmm.
[154:07.71]Perhaps this is the end you seek.
[154:08.93]Treasure, not gold, but the journey it inspired.
[154:11.01]Okay.
[154:18.24]Okay, Pioro joined the crew.
[154:25.32]I don't want this to be WarioWare anymore.
[154:26.56]I want this to be Pioro's game.
[154:32.50]Hold down A to extend Pyoro's tongue.
[154:35.10]His tongue automatically retracts when it's gone as far as it can go.
[154:37.68]I love it.

[210:44.17]I can't.
[210:45.47]I can't.
[210:47.41]I can't.
[211:18.08]I don't know.

[211:18.67]The cat?
[211:19.61]What are you talking about?
[211:20.41]Neither of them over there is black.
[211:24.85]I'm freaking out now.
[211:29.25]I'm losing fire.
[211:33.86]I'm losing everything here.
[211:42.05]Don't miss.
[211:42.47]I don't... Okay.
[211:46.03]I'm going... I'm doing one more.
[211:55.77]Last one.
[211:59.87]That was stupid.
[212:02.45]I shouldn't have... Why did I land on top of that?
[212:14.38]I'm going to video game world, and I'm going to get a high score.
[212:21.43]Mike, Orbulon, and Red.
[212:24.69]They're my favorites.
[212:31.70]Hey, Jeremy, I'm going to sleep.
[212:32.54]Can you turn it down a little bit?
[212:33.52]Yeah, sure.
[212:38.88]Game only.
[213:07.63]I'm gonna get through at least 35 in the end.
[213:10.73]I can't, I can't go faster.
[213:23.50]This feels like too fast.
[213:26.92]Suck it up and drop it on him.
[213:29.56]I feel like it's too slow.
[213:36.03]Alright, I'm good.
[213:38.31]Fifteen's gonna be so simple.
[213:54.10]This is like listening to a song normally after hearing the Nightcore version.
[214:06.59]That's so fun.
[214:11.15]Did I do it?
[214:43.73]Oh my goodness.
[214:44.61]Okay.
[214:45.55]I accidentally got that right.
[214:49.09]This was always so easy.
[214:52.44]Just push that one up.
[214:54.94]Okay, this is where it gets real.
[214:59.84]Praise?
[215:01.88]You're foolish.
[215:02.38]You're kind.
[215:02.88]You're kind.
[215:03.40]You're kind.
[215:05.22]You're kind.
[215:07.05]Perfect tea time.
[215:15.64]What was that?
[215:27.01]The original Game Boy Advance one?
[215:28.41]I don't know why that was me doing an accent.
[215:35.64]Don't lose lives for no reason, it's simple.
[215:46.72]Um, how would I capture the original Game Boy Advance?
[215:51.47]I played, there's a couple of them, aren't there?
[215:53.15]There's like the DS one, there's the Game Boy Advance one.
[215:57.41]Didn't I play the Game Boy Advance one?
[215:59.00]I feel like I did.
[216:12.20]Did I?
[216:12.72]It's on the Wii U. Yeah, I think I know.
[216:14.40]I did it.
[216:14.80]I did.
[216:15.36]Alright, level up.
[216:21.58]Okay, at least get a 10, so that's pretty important.
[216:32.02]Game Boy One was cool.
[216:33.70]Remember the big thing that hung off the cartridge?
[216:35.97]Attract your rotation.
[216:37.11]I never played it.
[216:39.76]Played the one that they ported to whatever console it was.
[216:43.26]I almost lost that one.
[216:49.24]I'm going for 50 at least.
[216:52.06]Oh god, I think you did.

[256:29.22]Right, I have to turn this back on.
[256:30.68]Now I'm not gonna be in sync with the game.
[256:35.30]That's what I'm doing.
[256:49.00]Video games!
[256:50.70]Alright, let's go for the big one.
[256:58.11]No, no, no, how do I go?
[257:01.69]Oh, it's pipe.
[257:03.13]Voices desynced?
[257:03.87]No, it shouldn't be anymore.
[257:04.63]Is it still desynced?
[257:06.77]I just changed it.
[257:09.25]Oh, no I didn't.
[257:09.97]I changed the wrong one.
[257:10.65]There you go.
[257:15.23]Ah, that's better.
[257:20.50]Sorry about that.
[257:21.22]Here we go.
[257:24.02]At least, like, level 50.
[257:25.08]I'm not gonna get 50, but you know, I'll try.
[257:40.41]Still bad?
[257:43.56]What?
[257:48.04]That should be good.
[257:50.54]I didn't change this, did I?
[257:56.30]That should be fixed.
[258:00.93]Let me just restart.
[258:03.17]Go back to rocking.
[258:16.55]So tomorrow, I'm not ending the stream, don't worry.
[258:19.47]Tomorrow we're going to finish No More Heroes 3.
[258:20.70]You want to check out the finale of that game.
[258:24.76]We have probably like two or three hours left on that game.
[258:27.74]That's the plan tomorrow.
[258:30.70]I'm getting kind of hungry though.
[258:35.54]I'll probably, maybe like another 20, 30 minutes.
[258:37.70]Five hours.
[258:38.34]Light.
[258:46.26]Ooh, that was close.
[258:47.96]Okay.
[258:48.22]There's, uh, five.
[258:49.32]There's two.
[258:50.16]There's more.
[258:51.19]There's five.
[258:52.49]There's three.
[258:53.59]There's two.
[258:54.49]There's two.
[258:55.33]Eyes.
[258:56.95]I love the little crayon characters.
[259:18.94]Almost didn't get that, come on.
[259:20.68]Keep it up!
[259:24.38]Whoa, he's har- ah, yeah, that's a bad character though.
[259:27.04]Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[259:29.52]Science.
[259:29.88]Nothing down.
[259:30.58]Hit!
[259:30.74]Sphere clear!
[259:31.32]Unplugged.
[259:50.41]You're not there, you're a cat.
[259:52.69]One.
[259:53.23]Neat!
[259:53.79]Shit, there was a blockade in the way.
[260:35.78]Jesus Christ!
[260:41.72]Don't you have band practice?
[260:44.00]Listen, what the fuck is the only one I need to practice?
[260:45.91]I barely have to practice anymore.
[260:48.01]I don't wanna take the bomb guy then.
[261:00.52]Jimmy T, Orbulon, Dr. Prygor, 18-Bolt, and Mike.
[261:12.97]Let's go.
[261:13.89]I'm going to use a rock outbreak.
[261:21.60]Nah, I'm good.
[261:22.88]I'm good.
[261:37.27]Orbulon's the best.
[261:38.29]I really think so.
[261:39.19]That one's easy for him.
[261:40.71]Ugh.
[262:19.94]Okay.
[262:20.76]Flip.
[262:21.70]No small science.
[262:28.46]Please.
[262:29.20]But of course.
[262:31.72]Air snake.
[262:32.90]Create path.
[262:34.27]Of course.
[262:36.05]Shitty.
[262:36.99]But of course.
[262:39.47]Take a peek.
[262:49.76]AHH, FIZZARDS BEATS PAPER!
[262:51.16]I just...
[263:22.17]One two one two three four Oh my god Huh
[264:04.09]I don't think that's how you build a snowman!
[264:35.01]Come on.
[264:36.15]That's not how you build a snowman.
[264:39.59]You put his head on the bottom.
[265:03.30]Redo it.
[265:05.26]Redo it, redo it, redo it, redo it, redo it, redo it.
[265:09.32]I got to 38.
[265:11.26]Alright, Mike, Elon.
[265:14.90]I don't like Dr. Krago.
[265:15.60]18 vault is fine.
[265:16.10]Jimmy was okay.
[265:36.23]9 volt.
[265:38.15]Oh, I know why you're saying it's a desync.
[265:40.15]It's because of this.
[265:42.87]My camera's fucked up.
[265:44.22]I can't fix it.
[265:44.90]I literally have to restart my computer.
[265:46.36]I gotta get the 10 without losing her life.
[265:51.16]It's really important.
[266:05.03]I thought it said erase us.
[266:10.05]Why did I pick 9-volt?
[266:10.65]Maybe it's the wild card I need.
[266:13.33]Maybe it was pink poop.
[266:15.67]I don't know.
[266:16.27]I saw pink poop.
[266:33.83]And how do you do that with this character by the way?
[266:38.77]1, 2, 3
[267:12.80]He's gotta go.
[267:15.06]You gotta go.
[267:15.56]That character has to go.
[267:17.17]No way.
[267:21.51]I'm not doing Peoria.
[267:32.69]He's bad.
[267:51.35]Actually, I kinda like the dog.
[267:53.15]Ah, I ate it.
[267:54.20]Get to 10 with no lives lost.
[268:19.96]You.
[268:48.00]It's free!
[269:16.87]M-m-mokai.
[269:17.69]Oi.
[269:46.69]Howdyup!
[269:48.53]Alright, we're good.
[269:50.19]Oh, fuck!
[270:16.98]Wee!
[270:17.26]Wee!
[270:18.26]Wee!
[270:19.42]Wee!
[270:59.56]You're rocking me happy already!
[271:58.58]Break it!
[271:59.43]The end has come.
[272:00.95]So high, so scarred.
[272:02.85]More please.
[272:27.53]I had it.
[272:28.21]I had it.
[272:28.67]That's what fucked me up.
[272:30.49]Get in there.
[272:31.41]Did I do it?
[272:32.25]I thought I just shoot him in his nose.
[272:57.77]I thought I should write his nose.
[272:58.93]Bless.
[273:00.33]Ah!
[273:39.50]Recalling I'm howling?
[274:05.57]Alright, I got to 41!
[274:07.11]I can do it!
[274:08.17]Alright, only two or three more tries and I'm done.
[274:13.84]Second car.
[274:37.58]2.2 gigahertz I'm not looking over here anymore
[275:07.44]Whoa.
[275:42.45]Free Oh
[276:09.92]OH MY FUNNY BONE!
[276:11.10]OH MY FUNNY BONE!
[276:11.92]MY FUNNY BONE!
[276:12.52]I JUST HIT MY FUNNY BONE AND MY ARM IS NUMB!
[276:14.82]My arm is numb.
[276:16.18]MY ARM IS NUMB!
[276:17.58]OH MY GOD!
[276:18.37]WHAT THE FUCK?! MMMMM.
[276:21.37]Ow. Ah, I'm okay. I'm alright.
[276:25.37]I'm okay. I'm alright.
[276:30.37]Aw shit.
[276:45.89]Out of this world!
[276:50.67]Let's run!
[276:51.71]Let's begin!
[276:52.45]Get him!
[276:53.35]On target!
[276:55.47]My specialty!
[276:57.81]Trap!
[276:58.15]Time to do this!
[277:18.80]I ring!
[277:20.20]I'll sit!
[277:20.78]Protect!
[277:51.60]I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MOTHERFUCKER DOES!
[277:56.33]Alright, slow- um, relax, Jeremy.
[277:58.83]It's not a problem.
[278:00.35]It's just, relax.
[278:02.35]You don't have to like, scream.
[278:04.51]It's fine.
[278:05.47]Just play with the characters you did it with before.
[278:08.61]And do it.
[278:09.19]Or there'll be consequences.
[278:20.54]There's consequences in MangaW.
[278:26.04]Alright, I actually like two more attempts.
[278:32.89]Two more attempts.
[278:47.14]I gotta get to 15 without getting hurt.
[278:48.66]I don't even know.
[278:51.44]I've never seen that before.
[278:54.01]Oh.
[279:20.83]Here we go.
[279:31.38]This one's for you.
[279:53.36]SMASH THIS FUCKING THING!!! !
[280:27.44]I'm ready.
[280:32.16]Draw.
[280:33.48]Alright, let's a go.
[280:43.27]Sorry.
[280:43.77]My time.
[280:47.75]I'm honored.
[280:50.42]So, ready.
[280:52.78]Let's begin.
[280:56.84]Looks furious.
[280:57.64]I'm not furious.
[280:58.84]Okay, this is the one I know it is.
[281:03.32]This is the one right here.
[281:08.16]This is it.
[281:13.06]No more fucking around.
[281:13.86]This is the one.
[281:19.27]Ashley, don't ever take Ashley out of the party.
[281:22.55]Why?
[281:24.43]Oh my...
[281:52.43]I'm alive though!
[281:56.01]You can't break an orange!
[281:57.37]Oh my fucking god!
[282:05.75]I'm leaning back.
[282:10.56]Alright, I'm just gonna lie back like this.
[282:27.10]Underwear's stuck to my ass.
[283:08.24]and it's gonna take a god it's gonna take a goddamn throw bar to get it off
[283:37.62]Great!
[284:35.67]Nice one!
[284:36.53]Pull!
[284:36.95]Nice!
[284:38.29]Wow, this is hard!
[284:39.69]Light up!
[284:41.19]See you later!
[284:43.48]Light up!
[284:44.70]Cover it!
[284:45.48]Fight three!
[284:48.82]Defeat!
[284:49.70]Clear path!
[284:50.70]Simple.
[284:51.52]I'm ready!
[284:53.46]Watch out!
[285:10.73]Got the crown!
[285:12.85]Nice!
[286:11.65]Why doesn't the basket move?
[286:24.06]The basket don't move, man!
[286:48.27]Oh, one, two, one, two!
[286:52.86]I hate that one!
[287:22.68]Ugh.
[287:56.81]That's not a... That was goddamn fucking close.
[287:58.93]I was so goddamn close.
[288:30.51]That's impossible with that character.
[288:35.69]Hard.
[289:00.43]FO is over me!
[289:19.93]It's just you don't even give me a fucking goddamn moments notice.
[289:34.66]I'm 47.
[289:35.80]Oh my god.
[289:36.82]It's so close.
[289:37.86]It's killing me.
[289:41.09]Damn it.
[289:41.47]47?
[289:41.83]Alright.
[289:42.51]Let's go.
[289:45.07]I'm a goddamn gamer.
[289:47.19]I'm gonna show you.
[289:49.57]My eyes are watering.
[290:28.90]Yeah!
[291:05.77]A monster.
[291:07.79]I'll show you a monster.
[291:11.09]TikTok.
[291:34.95]He's emo.
[291:36.21]I thought if I pulled that off that would've been great.
[291:39.99]I gotta go.
[291:40.49]I gotta stop streaming.
[291:41.55]I'm done.
[291:42.63]I'm done.
[291:42.99]I'm done.
[291:43.29]I'm gonna play like the funny open the ball game thing and then I'm done.
[291:48.83]Let's begin!
[291:50.80]Tobble!
[291:54.70]Superb!
[291:57.16]Adjust!
[291:57.50]Why not?
[291:59.46]Escape!
[292:13.23]He did.
[292:13.59]Yeah, he did.
[292:43.20]This stage is pretty much the same as the first one, except for a few things.
[293:21.75]You only need one life to win.
[293:24.27]Just need one to win.
[293:56.50]Oh, fuck.
[293:57.42]I'm honored.
[293:58.70]Yeah, indeed.
[294:33.73]I have so much money!
[294:34.73]Close your eyes!
[294:42.26]Goddamn!
[294:43.74]No more mistakes.
[294:52.81]No.
[294:53.05]More.
[294:53.19]Mistakes.
[295:07.03]No more mistakes.
[295:13.03]Read my lips.
[295:14.78]No new mistakes.
[295:46.26]I don't even know what the fuck that is.
[296:27.39]This happened so fast, it's so hard to... It happened so quickly that, like, you're just gonna get caught up.
[296:32.42]Like, you're gonna get caught up going the wrong way.
[296:35.58]You know what I mean?
[296:36.10]Like, I'm gonna get caught up going the wrong fucking way.
[296:38.78]It's over.
[296:39.14]Alright, this is my last attempt.
[296:43.05]And then I'm done.
[296:44.67]I'm not doing it again.
[296:45.89]Oh!
[297:01.18]You guys are just burning money if you vote for me.
[297:05.72]More like that, please.
[297:35.06]You fucking come on!
[297:36.95]You're fucking kidding me!
[297:40.33]There's three!
[297:46.67]Oh my god!
[297:52.74]It's not gonna happen man, this shit is impossible.
[297:57.76]This shit is impossible.
[298:03.50]It's the fact that you have to change character, and I don't know what the hell these goddamn games are.
[298:14.83]See, I like some of them fly, some of them don't fly, some of them fucking move, some of them don't move, some of them have guns, some of them don't have guns.
[298:27.96]One more.
[298:28.40]I mean it.
[298:32.51]And I'm gonna watch, I'm gonna do it fucking backwards.
[299:06.03]It looks like it was the same color as the other one!
[299:42.47]I'm gonna- okay.
[299:44.47]Okay, that's it.
[299:45.11]I'm out of gas.
[299:46.03]I'm gone.
[299:47.85]I'm literally out of energy.
[299:49.23]I'm done.
[299:49.93]I'm toast.
[299:50.91]It's like I'm cooked.
[299:51.71]My goose is cooked.
[299:52.51]I'm done.
[299:57.91]When I got to 47, that was literally six months of my life that I just deleted.
[300:11.97]If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen right now.
[300:39.94]No!
[300:40.60]Not four!
[300:41.22]I didn't want to hit it more than... I didn't want to hit it!
[301:08.81]That'll take one.
[301:09.93]You're devious.
[301:10.68]You're delightful.
[301:46.23]That one doesn't count, it actually doesn't.
[301:48.05]That one actually does not count, you're right.
[302:13.83]That was just a warm-up.
[302:56.29]I- What?!
[303:01.18]I fuckin' hate it.
[303:46.52]Maybe you should try easy.
[303:48.24]Damn it.
[303:48.92]Okay.
[303:49.73]I've got people to fight.
[304:10.03]Alright, you love helicopters!
[304:11.79]Take it!
[304:12.45]Can you go higher than President?
[304:18.33]Presidential Suite.
[304:19.17]What else do you like?
[304:22.49]You like cameras.
[304:25.69]No, no, you don't really like cameras that much.
[304:27.57]What about, uh, Warby Lama?
[304:44.44]Cricket, please.
[304:47.62]Wait, you're the 47th floor guy?
[304:49.86]Ooh, headphones!
[305:14.06]What do you like?
[305:15.74]How about a shower cap?
[305:22.86]47 is good, but certainly not 50.
[305:23.94]Oh yeah?
[305:32.86]That's what you think?
[305:34.46]Okay.
[305:44.53]That's what- that's what you think?
[305:45.57]Empty!
[305:52.62]Feed!
[306:15.64]I don't understand that one.
[306:19.35]I'm done.
[306:21.41]I'm out of here.
[306:22.87]I'm leaving.
[306:23.59]How about we just go with a fuck-based team?
[306:34.06]Because it doesn't matter.
[306:39.28]I'm not going to win, so let's do whatever.
[306:42.49]Here we go.
[306:59.33]Not bad.
[306:59.71]Oh, I get it now.
[307:02.24]Oh, touch.
[307:02.62]No, doggy!
[307:32.69]She's holding a what?!
[307:33.87]I thought I was talking about me!
[307:56.02]Okay, that's enough.
[307:57.47]That's enough.
[307:57.99]I've had enough.
[307:59.11]I've had enough.
[307:59.75]One more.
[308:00.79]This is my final attempt.
[308:03.27]The last one.
[308:04.21]If I don't get it here, then I am going to walk out.
[308:10.23]Last one.
[308:10.97]This is it.
[308:11.57]This is literally the last one.
[308:12.69]If I do another one, I will literally... Okay.
[308:14.83]If I do another one after this, I will give a thousand community subs.
[308:18.97]Okay?
[308:27.71]I'm honored!
[308:30.01]Fired up!
[308:33.07]Let's begin!
[308:33.65]Topple!
[308:33.99]Aha!
[308:34.13]Remarkable!
[308:35.05]Why not?
[308:35.59]Serve!
[308:36.11]Oh, girl.
[308:37.65]That'll do.
[308:38.03]Stick together!
[308:38.63]I'm in!
[308:39.31]Assemble!
[309:00.97]Watch out!
[309:01.45]Cross!
[309:01.77]Harvest!
[309:02.27]Knockdown!
[309:03.11]Extinguish!
[309:04.07]Match!
[309:32.74]Watch.
[309:34.34]Find it.
[309:35.28]Catch three.
[310:12.27]I couldn't tell the difference!
[310:15.99]Okay.
[310:16.37]I'm gonna have to stop.
[310:42.57]God damn it.
[310:45.46]God damn it.
[310:46.22]I want to do it so bad.
[311:22.19]Alright, so I'm not going to do that one, right?
[311:24.01]That, but I'm not, I'm not going to do that one again.
[311:26.89]But I can play the other one.
[311:27.93]I can do this one.
[311:35.53]It's for this one.
[311:36.17]It's not for the, it's not for any of the other levels in the game.
[311:44.79]Double or nothing for five more attempts.
[311:46.73]No way, dude.
[311:47.75]That's 5,000 sub.
[311:49.76]I can't, I'm not doing that.
[311:51.82]I'm not doing that.
[311:52.58]Okay, but does that count?
[311:59.21]I need a general consensus.
[312:01.33]Does that count if I were to do a different level?
[312:09.94]That doesn't count.
[312:11.46]It's only that crazy one that I'm trying to get 50 rounds on.
[312:14.24]No, I'm just going to play... Alright, I'm done.
[312:18.18]I'll see you tomorrow.
[312:21.49]I'm going to play No More Heroes 3 tomorrow.
[312:23.71]And then when I beat No More Heroes 3 tomorrow, it's only going to take like a couple hours to get through that.
[312:29.24]I'm getting to 50 tomorrow.
[312:37.06]I'm getting to 50 tomorrow.
[312:38.46]After No More Heroes 3.
[312:44.65]God.
[312:44.95]Well.
[312:48.31]Well.
[312:50.33]What should I give this for a rating?
[312:52.43]Um... Okay.
[312:54.47]Here we go.
[312:55.81]Use it.
[313:00.29]So the rating of this game... First of all, thanks to the subs, everybody.
[313:04.54]All the resubs, all the new subs, all of you.
[313:07.64]Some of you might be brand new.
[313:08.76]Some of you have been here for 10 years.
[313:10.96]Thanks, guys.
[313:14.38]Really appreciate it.
[313:16.24]Maybe we'll see you tomorrow for No More Heroes 3 finale and get to level 50 in Super Hard on WarioWare.
[313:25.23]I'm gonna get some food.
[313:26.98]Okay, well, here you go.
[313:28.08]I had a lot of fun with it.
[313:29.62]I still want to play, so that's a good indicator.
[313:33.08]It was probably like a 6.5 or a 7 out of 10.
[313:36.98]Until I realized that you could collect those coins and feed your crew.
[313:45.61]I think that became a solid 8 something after that.
[313:48.97]Like an 8.2.
[313:54.01]The actual video game, I think, was a little short.
[313:58.27]But I think, was the other one, I feel like the other one was longer.
[314:01.03]I feel like Smooth Moves was a longer game.
[314:04.98]Just with more minigames and stuff.
[314:06.42]Maybe I'm just completely wrong.
[314:09.22]But, um, I think it's really good.
[314:20.99]I'm like watching this cutscene.
[314:23.58]What am I talking about?
[314:24.30]I'm talking about WarioWare Smooth Moves being a longer game than this one.
[314:28.70]I remember playing it for a little longer.
[314:29.84]They have insanely short story, but tons of post-game shit.
[314:39.94]Yeah, I think I'd have to play it a little bit more to figure that out.
[314:44.48]This one seems like it has daily challenges and stuff.
[314:46.64]That's really cool.
[314:49.50]Yeah, I think it's great.
[314:51.56]It's way better than game in Wario by a thousand times.
[314:59.84]This game has about 20 more micro games than smooth moves.
[315:02.48]You know what I think it is?
[315:04.41]I think that like the Wiimote, moving around the Wiimote and doing stuff with the Wiimote felt a little more involved than jumping with a 2D character to like turn knob with your character on the screen.
[315:18.75]I think that's maybe what I'm thinking of there, when I'm seeing it like that.
[315:24.22]I think the concept is great.
[315:26.08]It's actually a really, really cool concept.
[315:27.48]It throws your brain off even more than the original games.
[315:34.88]Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
[315:36.68]Take care of yourselves.
[315:37.74]Goodbye tomorrow.
[315:39.42]No More Heroes 3 finale.
[315:40.68]By the way, if you haven't seen No More Heroes 3 and you want to play it yourself, be careful on tomorrow's first couple hours of the stream because it's literally the last two or three hours of the whole game.
[315:50.49]We'll see you tomorrow.
[315:52.81]Good night.
[315:53.27]Goodbye.
[315:54.37]My voice is shot because I've been screaming.
[315:56.25]It's literally been a scream stream.
[315:57.59]I hope you've been enjoying it.
[315:58.35]I hope you've been enjoying it.
[316:00.99]Yes, that's what I was trying to say.
[316:03.21]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[316:05.17]Good night.
[316:05.51]Goodbye.
[316:05.84]See you later.
[316:36.96]you
[317:11.83]you
