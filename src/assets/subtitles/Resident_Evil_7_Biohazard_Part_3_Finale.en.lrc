[08:05.67]Again, sorry, there are no notifications.
[08:08.73]I cannot see if anybody is subscribing or if anybody is giving bits.
[08:11.77]I'm sorry about that.
[08:17.03]I do not have any access to it when I'm stuck inside of this creation.
[08:24.12]Let me move this.

[26:49.56]Crack it.
[27:01.60]Okay, I guess I can't even put it in.
[27:03.12]I have to, like, go actually find it.
[27:07.24]Okay.
[27:16.89]These boxes are fucking trapped.
[27:23.83]God fucking damn it, man.
[27:25.83]Fuck you.
[27:27.69]Fuck you.
[27:29.00]Fuck you.
[27:29.88]Oh, that's so annoying.
[27:31.04]God.
[27:35.80]Well, the one on the left is okay.
[27:37.80]I'm gonna have to start shooting boxes.
[28:03.34]Gonna have to start shooting the boxes, not slashing them.
[28:07.70]Okay, that's good.
[28:08.78]Let's go.
[28:13.94]This place is like fucking booby-trapped, right?
[28:18.72]Something's gonna like...
[28:38.45]There's no way I could even fucking see that thing.
[28:42.75]That was such a tiny little wire.
[28:44.64]How was I even supposed to see that?
[28:48.84]Shit.
[28:51.28]There's no way I could.
[28:52.64]That was blending in with the black background.
[29:01.61]Shit.
[29:03.83]Oh well.
[29:07.34]Now at least I know not to destroy the right box.
[29:12.65]And I don't lose any unnecessary health.
[29:16.35]I'm actually glad that happened.
[29:17.47]Let's get the shotgun out here.
[29:30.57]I want to just get rid of this thing.
[29:32.54]No problems at all.
[29:36.94]This one doesn't explode either, and there's shells in here.
[29:40.19]No, there's handgun ammo in that one now.
[29:43.09]I don't know.
[29:43.49]I already got the shells.
[29:44.11]Okay.
[29:45.63]Booby trap.
[29:49.75]There it is.
[29:50.38]Look at that.
[29:50.92]It's so hard to see it.
[29:52.90]It's so tiny.
[29:57.24]He's right behind me, isn't he?
[30:12.42]It's too intense.
[30:14.02]Don't fucking run into it.
[30:15.30]He's right behind me.
[30:25.61]God damn it.
[30:26.55]God, come on, man.
[30:28.05]What the fuck?
[30:37.34]Where's that other one?

[35:26.68]Alright.
[35:26.92]Yeah.
[35:27.42]Fuck yeah.
[35:28.06]I didn't know that.

[36:30.89]Okay.
[36:34.17]Let's take the D-series arm.
[36:38.70]No, not yet.
[36:39.46]I'm going to take the psychostimulants right now, too.
[36:43.78]Just... Fuck it.
[36:46.50]I mean, why not?
[36:47.74]I haven't been using them.
[36:50.66]And we're good to go.
[37:01.04]Okay.
[37:06.36]Okay, this is like a wacky room.
[37:07.85]Alright, there's an item in there, which means it's not going to explode.
[37:20.03]Strong chem fluid.
[37:23.16]Yep.
[37:25.94]Oh.
[37:30.72]I thought that was going to make flamethrower rounds.
[37:36.52]That might have been not a great thing.
[37:38.62]That might have been not a great thing right there.
[37:40.32]I thought that was going to make flamethrower rounds.
[37:46.26]Burner.
[37:46.78]Yeah.
[37:47.88]Whatever.
[37:48.54]Fuck it.
[37:49.97]Nothing over there.
[37:51.51]At least I have two more rounds for the grenade launcher.
[37:54.77]Which I should replace.
[37:56.77]Yeah.
[37:57.15]I'm going to...
[38:01.77]Tape?
[38:02.55]Wait, watch the tape.
[38:03.67]What tape?
[38:05.35]Tape?
[38:07.51]There was a tape in here?
[38:08.37]I didn't see the tape.
[38:14.12]What tape?
[38:16.10]I already watched that one.
[38:18.28]I already watched that one.
[38:20.78]Hold on, what tape are you guys talking about?
[38:28.37]What tape?
[38:28.91]What tape?
[38:36.45]Jerma can read chat.
[38:37.35]No, I just, like, happened to look over and I saw it.
[38:43.79]Get the tape.
[38:48.05]And this is a tape that I don't have yet.
[38:51.57]So, there is no tape.
[38:55.19]Alright.
[38:55.95]Alright.
[39:00.95]I thought I've watched all the ones that I need to.
[39:03.37]So far.
[39:04.79]There's no tape in here.
[39:05.63]I'm sure I'll have to come back for one.
[39:10.26]I'm going to take... I'm going to replace this.
[39:13.26]I want... I'm taking out the grenade launcher.
[39:20.14]I'm going to put this away.
[39:25.17]Because, I mean, if there's a boss or something coming up, I can just destroy that boss, right?
[39:32.65]I don't have any flamethrower rounds, so might as well store it.
[39:38.51]Alright, let's go.
[39:40.15]Let's get going.
[39:41.08]I already looked over here.
[39:41.80]I'm pretty sure there's nothing else I can really do, except what I did look... Nope, it's this.
[39:49.88]I think that's gonna explode.
[39:53.27]I'm gonna reload the save if it explodes.
[39:57.23]It's your lucky day.
[39:58.05]Okay, if I find an herb, I'm good.
[40:02.83]Let's go.
[40:04.01]Just hop down.
[40:21.42]What is this?
[40:25.99]Well, I don't have any that's missing a battery.
[40:27.98]Sure.
[40:36.34]I'm reloading the safe.
[40:39.53]Good.
[40:40.35]Don't have to reload the safe.
[40:56.28]Nice.
[40:58.04]Those will come in handy.
[41:01.89]So where's this going to?
[41:02.83]I don't know what the hell that is.
[41:09.53]Okay.
[41:22.56]Hey, there's the battery.
[41:24.36]Perfect.
[41:28.50]Burner fuel.
[41:31.52]This is a boss for sure.
[41:33.68]I told you I was gonna do it.
[41:40.26]I told you I was gonna fucking do it.
[41:45.00]Y'all didn't think I was gonna do it.
[41:48.24]That's unnecessary damage to take before a boss.
[41:51.12]Now I know not to hit that one.
[42:01.06]I ain't taking that kind of damage before a boss.
[42:04.66]And actually, I know I get burner fuel, so... Fuck it, we're fine.
[42:08.38]Fuck it.
[42:12.28]We're good.
[42:23.03]I need a battery.
[42:23.85]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:32.44]You can call me a save scummer all you want.
[42:34.78]I ain't taking that kind of damage right before a boss fight.
[42:38.96]No chance.
[42:53.87]Didn't get any burner fuel this time.
[42:58.65]Hmm.
[43:02.77]That changed a little bit.
[43:07.18]Give me a second.
[43:07.70]I want to go back and save and get the grenade launcher.
[43:10.10]Because I got different items.
[43:14.56]Give me a second.
[43:20.80]I don't want to put that in yet.
[43:21.80]Oh, fuck.
[43:22.34]I have to, don't I?
[43:23.16]Because I dropped down.
[43:23.94]Alright, well, fuck it.
[43:26.31]Here we go.
[43:26.83]Whatever.
[43:27.13]Alright.
[43:30.69]Let's go.
[43:39.12]Why does everything explode?
[43:42.16]What the fuck?
[43:44.46]Come on.
[43:51.19]Barn fight.
[43:52.23]What?
[43:52.47]What the?
[43:56.59]What the fuck?
[43:57.53]What the hell?
[43:58.03]What is that?
[43:58.79]What is that?
[44:00.54]What?
[44:02.86]What is that?
[44:04.40]Where did it go?
[44:07.69]Oh, it's puking at me!
[44:09.16]It's fucking puking at me.
[44:11.18]Fuck.
[44:39.93]Whoa.
[44:41.31]Run, run, run.
[44:43.95]What is that?
[44:55.13]No!
[44:57.68]Oh shit.
[45:20.82]How am I doing?
[45:22.70]Jesus fucking Christ.
[45:25.72]Fat man down.
[45:26.84]Fat man down.
[45:27.52]He was never my favorite anyways.
[45:51.50]Ugh.
[45:59.17]Whew!
[45:59.99]My goodness.
[46:01.91]We're in an elevator?
[46:02.63]I could just take the herb.
[46:08.91]No, it's not worth it.
[46:33.09]I think that thing's gonna get up.
[46:35.51]That thing's gonna whip around and grab me and scream in my face.
[46:40.31]I'll bet you anything.
[46:41.09]I'm gonna go up there, it's gonna grab me by the chest and pull me in and go like... I can tell you right now, it's gonna go... It's gonna do it!
[46:54.22]It's gonna do that noise that I just said!
[47:01.98]No, it isn't.
[47:23.90]Okay.
[47:26.08]Anything on the table?
[47:27.99]No.
[47:28.61]Anything in the sink?
[47:29.53]No.
[47:30.33]Table.
[47:30.91]Supplements.
[47:32.01]Sure thing.
[47:32.59]Chemical fluid.
[47:33.59]Thank you.
[47:34.99]I would love to use that right now.
[47:37.63]Wait a minute.
[47:46.20]I made a decision.
[47:48.74]Decision has been made.
[47:49.98]I need more ammo.
[47:52.17]I have a health.
[47:52.89]Just don't get hit.
[47:54.03]I got lots of ammo now.
[47:55.39]I feel a little bit safer.
[47:56.43]Yeah, I feel safer now.
[48:01.54]What was it?
[48:04.12]Okay.
[48:09.26]You're next.
[48:10.42]You're next.
[48:10.96]1408.
[48:10.98]1408.
[48:11.42]Got it.
[48:17.14]Yeah, why don't you slam one of those fucking Heinz tomato ketchup bottles, you fucking freak.
[48:23.55]Don't even think about going free.
[48:24.75]Okay.
[48:24.87]14... Oh, wait.
[48:47.90]Did I get rid of them?
[48:48.70]I don't know.
[48:50.26]Yeah, I did.
[48:54.18]Fourteen.
[48:55.74]Zero.
[48:57.86]Eight.
[48:58.92]Open up.
[49:00.38]Uh-huh.
[49:00.84]Open.
[49:02.69]Uh-huh.
[49:05.31]Uh-huh.
[49:05.99]What?
[49:16.13]Are you fucking kidding me?
[49:27.99]What?
[49:30.35]How many things do I have to get rid of?
[49:31.43]Can I at least... Oh, God.
[49:45.07]Ah, but I need health.
[49:49.97]Should I... Should I take the herb?
[49:54.21]What do you guys think?
[49:57.08]Should I, like, take that green herb just to have full health in here?
[50:00.80]I feel like I should.
[50:04.48]I'm gonna take the little heal.
[50:08.28]I'm just gonna take the herb.
[50:09.17]I feel like that would be a mistake to not do that.
[50:14.22]Just take the regular herb.
[50:24.00]Wait.
[50:25.20]I think I can get in there.
[50:27.22]I think I can get in there.
[50:28.82]Watch this.
[50:33.84]Damn it!
[50:34.18]I can't.
[50:56.96]Wait, this is that room from the video.
[51:07.20]Do I just have to do this again?
[51:08.24]I have to do this stupid puzzle again, right?

[52:27.63]Penis fish?
[52:28.75]Yup, penis fish.
[52:30.61]And... fetus.
[52:33.49]Don't think I fucking remember these things!
[52:39.00]Okay.

[52:44.94]That goes in.
[52:47.96]Then the... doll gets burnt.
[52:51.51]This is new.
[52:57.93]That's new.
[52:58.39]Okay, there's some space, but okay.
[53:02.69]Let's go do that part.
[53:04.75]That's where the... Yeah, are you fucking kidding me?

[54:09.44]Dirty telescope.
[54:11.31]Run this back here.
[54:23.77]I wonder... Can I look through this?
[54:25.26]No.
[54:29.48]No.
[54:31.75]Okay, um... I need to look at that.
[54:35.83]There we go.
[54:38.53]Yeah, I already did that.
[54:44.27]I need to get in there.
[54:45.29]What was the next... Burn this.
[54:46.45]But how come I couldn't burn this before?
[54:47.59]No, because it wasn't, like, targetable.
[54:50.38]Okay.
[54:51.36]Get the balloon.
[54:55.94]So, if you didn't get that tape before, you'd have to figure this all out right now.
[55:00.83]Doing the tape, like, lets you know, I guess, like, how to do the puzzle in a way, apparently.
[55:07.65]Okay.
[55:11.44]Let's get a balloon.
[55:12.28]Yeah.
[55:17.52]That shit won't open.
[55:18.52]It's loser.
[55:18.84]Loser.
[55:29.56]Wait, could I have just done this from the very beginning?
[55:39.76]I could have just done this from the very beginning.
[55:46.01]For some reason, I thought I had to do it all.
[55:52.67]I guess I still kind of have to do it all.
[55:56.05]Yeah, I do.
[55:59.09]Although, I could have just turned this off from the very beginning.
[56:11.18]Alright.
[56:11.42]So, what do I... Balloon goes on here, right?
[56:23.14]What if that killed me?
[56:24.90]I'm just imagining dying from that shit.
[56:38.13]Did I not have to do that?
[56:42.70]Well, I wanted the guy to write the fucking note.
[56:45.04]Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[56:56.78]It's alright, I wanted the whole experience.
[56:58.45]Alright.
[57:07.40]Now what happens to me?
[57:08.58]I didn't get this far before.
[57:10.00]The last time I did this shit... What am I looking at here?
[57:23.49]What am I looking at?
[57:25.07]What the fuck is this shitty CG fireball?
[57:28.47]It's shitty CG.

[61:28.54]Do I need like a smoke detector?
[61:31.30]I don't know what to do.
[61:32.70]Turn on the fucking valve, right?
[61:35.30]Do I just... Please, I don't want to go in there and die.
[61:37.44]Is there anything else I have to do?
[61:39.58]I should just fucking go in there.

[67:29.90]Good thing that's saving right there.
[67:38.73]Thank God.
[67:42.39]Two health potions.
[67:50.51]This is probably gonna break.
[67:59.66]That's probably gonna break eventually here.
[68:01.98]Wait, that opened up that, so I gotta go this way.
[68:06.04]Down, where the hell did that open?
[68:29.32]Oh, what?
[68:33.86]Hey, just run!
[68:41.78]He's dead.
[68:45.54]Fuck!
[68:49.10]Get out of the way, you fucker!
[68:57.21]They don't come in here, do they?
[69:00.85]Thank god.
[69:03.43]Jesus.
[69:11.41]That's a flood of rounds.
[69:16.70]They are stalking me the fuck up big time.
[69:18.78]Is this like the last boss?
[69:24.62]No.
[69:29.04]It's okay.
[69:29.47]No, that's actually okay.
[69:30.67]Because I needed a little bit of health.
[69:32.23]I didn't have max health.
[69:35.91]No, that's fine.
[69:37.39]That's actually a good thing.
[69:39.93]Yeah, that was a good thing.
[69:41.63]I'm okay with that.
[69:44.27]I was at just barely green, so I'm okay.
[69:52.36]Alright, flame rounds.
[69:53.68]Did I leave any others in here?
[69:54.76]Let's get rid of these.
[69:58.58]Yeah, get rid of those.
[70:03.10]Okay, let's do it.
[70:11.83]Yeah, no, that's okay.
[70:22.56]Fuck.
[70:31.49]God damn it.
[70:47.89]We're to the teeth.
[70:53.86]Let's replace the knife.
[70:55.14]The handgun.
[71:02.10]I'm going to replace the ammo.
[71:06.08]With the regular ammo.
[71:07.12]Alright, let's go.
[71:10.23]Burner.
[71:11.75]Let's have the shotgun out first.
[71:13.15]I feel like that's going to be the best bet for anything.
[71:22.26]Oh, dear.
[71:23.06]There are people here.
[71:23.74]Who the fuck is this person?
[71:32.74]Zoe?
[71:34.11]Zoe, I... Not now.
[71:35.45]We don't have the time.
[71:37.83]Do you have both ingredients?
[71:41.23]Right here.
[71:42.15]This should be enough, right?
[71:43.55]If we make him fast enough, my father and Lucas aren't far away.
[71:47.98]He's coming.
[71:49.20]Daddy's coming.
[71:50.94]Good.
[71:51.84]There's enough for two.
[71:56.20]What are you making there?
[71:58.80]I'm just getting ready for it.
[71:59.74]I'm getting ready.
[72:00.46]I am fucking ready.
[72:01.58]What's next?
[72:02.86]There's a boat outside.
[72:04.34]We'll take it through the swamp.
[72:05.68]Don't you turn around and get me.
[72:06.88]Not the best look that I saw without the serum.
[72:15.84]Hey, one of those is mine.
[72:19.94]Who is this?
[72:25.71]Who the fuck is this?
[72:49.68]Right in the eyes.
[72:55.37]Reload, reload, reload, reload, reload, reload, reload, reload!
[73:13.76]No!
[73:14.04]That's not what I wanted to do!
[73:14.98]Oh!
[73:19.56]Oh, that's not what I wanted!
[73:20.80]This is not what I wanted!
[73:34.99]You fucker!
[73:36.32]Oh!

[74:00.77]Right up his ass!
[74:03.45]Right up his ass!
[74:06.39]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[74:22.54]Any more eyeballs?
[74:28.77]Yup, right there.
[74:31.31]Whoa!
[74:32.57]Fuck!
[74:36.33]Come on, I'm okay on health.
[74:58.87]Where's the last eye?
[75:00.65]Right on his arm.
[75:05.47]Got it.
[75:12.65]Got it.
[75:14.93]Now what?
[75:18.67]Is there one more?
[75:40.35]What do you got?
[75:41.89]What do you got?
[75:42.35]The fuck is he doing?
[75:49.22]Get out of the water.
[75:50.24]Get out of the water.
[75:50.90]Get out of the water.
[75:51.54]Get out of the water.
[75:54.56]Where the fuck am I?
[75:57.96]Right in his face.
[76:03.67]Grenade.
[76:15.11]Oh fuck it hurts it hurt me it hurt it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts
[76:46.83]Where am I?
[76:47.43]Nice guy.
[76:55.12]I got some, ah!
[76:56.50]Use the serum on him.
[77:05.95]Use the serum?
[77:06.55]You don't want me to cure him.
[77:17.45]Yeah.
[77:18.09]Holy shit.
[77:18.79]That was fucking crazy.
[77:53.23]Replenish some of my stuff, that'd be nice.
[78:04.31]Come on, I can see it.
[78:05.19]I can't get over there?
[78:07.23]I must have had to get it when the boss fight was going on.
[78:10.93]Can't get over there.
[78:12.25]Oh well.
[78:14.15]Oh well.
[78:20.25]Whoops-a-daisy.
[78:30.44]Who's it for?
[78:30.78]Fight for it.
[78:31.20]Oh, no.
[78:33.24]Oh!
[79:08.42]What do I do?
[79:09.22]I don't know.
[79:09.68]Who should I cure?
[79:10.40]Who do I cure?
[79:12.60]Save your wife.
[79:14.10]Save your wife.
[79:15.40]Straw poll.
[79:16.12]Straw poll.
[79:16.54]Flip a coin.
[79:18.48]I gotta get a poll for this.
[79:19.76]This is extremely important.
[79:26.23]Who do I save?
[79:30.61]I don't know.
[79:33.33]Mia?
[79:33.69]Or Zoe?
[79:40.52]Mia or Zoe?
[79:41.22]Mia's on the left, Zoe's on the right.
[79:45.78]Who?
[79:54.28]Who do I save?
[80:00.69]This is pretty close.
[80:06.01]Your wife tried to kill you.
[80:07.47]Zoe tried to save you.
[80:12.78]Oh, man.
[80:13.38]Alright, like 30 seconds.
[80:16.29]Mia is currently winning.
[80:22.98]Wife, wife, wife, wife, wife.
[80:31.64]Alright.
[80:32.56]10 seconds.
[80:33.92]We're going with Mia.
[80:34.64]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.
[80:37.14]That's it.
[80:39.38]It's Mia.
[80:41.80]Thank you for voting.
[80:42.53]We're saving the girl on the left.
[80:45.77]We're saving Mia.
[80:48.01]Alright.
[80:48.39]Let's back to it.
[80:51.43]Cure Mia.
[80:54.61]Sorry, lady.
[80:55.99]We ain't curing you.
[81:01.35]It's fine.
[81:03.23]It was foolish thinking I could escape.
[81:05.25]But Zoe... Go!
[81:07.29]Both of you just go!
[81:08.97]That was really loud.
[81:10.12]I'm with us.
[81:11.90]I'm sure there's someone who can help.
[81:13.42]I don't even give a fuck.
[81:14.90]I'm just like, I'm getting to the... What the fuck?
[81:22.21]I'll send help.
[81:23.49]Don't bother.
[81:24.99]There won't be anyone left to help!
[81:36.64]Bye.
[81:38.66]So, how was your day?
[81:42.62]Mine was interesting.
[81:44.74]I came to rescue you from this fucked up place.
[81:47.74]Weird, huh?
[81:50.08]Yeah, you want to go to Burger King?
[81:51.70]I need a readjustment here.
[82:00.47]This is super tunnel vision right now.
[82:08.92]Am I controlling the boat?
[82:10.62]Wait, did you see that face?
[82:14.34]She had a Satan face for one second.
[82:16.80]You saw that.
[82:18.30]Look at that Satan.
[82:18.90]She's got a Satan face.
[82:23.88]She kind of had a Satan face.
[82:25.18]Mia, I know you've been through a lot.
[82:28.44]We need to talk.
[82:31.38]You had something to do with all this, didn't you?
[82:35.64]Look, I just want to know the truth.
[82:39.36]Ethan, I honestly don't remember.
[82:41.56]I'm just waiting for it to grab me.
[82:59.67]Oh, my head is so itchy.
[83:01.45]Oh, my God.
[83:01.83]I have to itch my head so bad.
[83:03.13]You're okay.
[83:07.82]Itchy head.
[83:10.54]Wicked itchy head.
[83:22.08]We're in this thing for three days.
[83:23.34]Okay.
[83:29.12]Well, the game's obviously not over.
[83:30.25]I guess...
[83:46.65]Another movie theater cutscene.
[83:50.55]Wait, do I have to play as Mia now?
[83:54.39]Oh, isn't that just fucking swell?
[83:59.00]Isn't that just fucking swell?
[84:02.16]Does she have anything?
[84:05.34]Strange bottle.
[84:11.14]E-001.
[84:16.87]Well, this is fucking cool looking.
[84:19.69]This is really cool looking.
[84:23.05]Nice.
[84:23.48]Okay.
[84:24.26]Well, whatever.
[84:24.86]This place is huge.
[84:53.30]Okay, well, the smoke monster is now in this.
[85:11.97]That's cool.
[85:14.24]from that popular JJ Abrams television show, Land of the Lost.
[85:30.68]Ah, my immersion, no hands for her, huh?
[85:46.72]Oh, come on.
[85:48.56]Oh my god.
[85:50.30]I don't have anything either.
[85:54.17]I don't have any weapons or any items, anything.
[85:56.61]I just have like a strange prescription.
[86:01.74]That's it.
[86:20.76]Can't go in there, just gotta go around.
[86:22.26]I don't think any of these doors are gonna open.
[86:33.87]I'm having flashbacks of the underground lab.
[86:38.27]Umbrella Corporation, right?
[86:43.63]Umbrella was behind it all.
[86:46.42]Albert Wesker.
[86:49.01]Back from the dead?
[86:50.85]For like the fourth time, right?
[86:54.77]Well, it's interesting that you found my lab.
[86:58.19]Yes, Mia.
[87:00.09]How... smart of you.
[87:06.48]I never thought that you'd find it.
[87:08.32]But you did, didn't you?
[87:11.60]Do you like my giant booger statue, Mia?
[87:14.70]I made it for you.
[87:24.03]I hope he's in this game.
[87:24.98]Please tell me that Albert Wesker is going to show up and say a bunch of fucking cheesy lines.
[87:30.04]That's crass.
[87:32.65]Chris Redfield, right?
[87:36.51]That's the bad guy?
[87:37.23]That's the good guy?
[87:38.68]Yes, of course.
[87:55.72]Oh, yes, it's me, it's me.
[88:03.36]What?
[88:04.04]Why is it open now?
[88:27.12]Okay.
[88:30.10]Turns out I'm the monster, right guys?
[88:34.77]I've been the monster the whole time.
[88:37.88]Everything bad is because of me.
[89:00.91]These tiny little fucking corridors causing me lots of anxiety.
[89:34.88]Flashback, right?
[89:46.82]Crew register.
[89:47.72]Captain Ed Carlow, Chief Engineer Paul Fitzgerald, First Officer Giovanni Finetti, Clark Walsh, Dwayne Chalmers, Jim Stockholm, Jared Waldell, and Albert Westgar.
[90:02.32]She's not my child.
[90:09.33]He must've been hiding from something.
[90:13.58]Me, me, I'm the bad guy.
[90:16.28]I already know it.
[90:35.99]Don't you fucking dare.
[90:39.16]Don't you fucking dare.
[90:40.50]Fucking asshole.
[90:50.43]No, okay, I just... To the left.
[91:00.05]Whoa.
[91:18.20]Hello?
[91:18.74]Hello?
[91:19.44]Hello?
[91:20.16]Hello?
[91:23.75]That was fucking so lame.
[91:25.69]I'm so sorry.
[91:26.69]That was fucking terrible.
[91:33.01]Why did I think that was gonna be even remotely fucking funny?
[91:39.27]Why did I think that was gonna be funny?
[91:44.21]That was fucking awful.
[91:45.37]I'm so sorry.
[91:47.29]I'm so sorry.
[91:52.99]Oh, yeah, don't worry.
[91:54.23]I'll get him with the echo joke in a giant space.
[91:58.95]Fucking idiot.
[92:04.15]What like a G movie joke?
[92:10.40]What like a fucking rated PG?
[92:15.12]Uh, Annabelle.
[92:15.70]Built in 1987.
[92:16.38]Deadweight.
[92:17.10]271,000 in length.
[92:17.63]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[92:22.71]Okay, let's go.
[92:23.51]Wait.
[92:24.99]Musical notes.
[92:32.45]Are you remembering?
[92:46.45]That's me.
[92:58.62]I don't like those flashes, man.
[93:00.92]Cause dude, for you guys on the screen, it's like a white flash on your screen.
[93:05.58]For me, it is like somebody is taking a fucking camera and putting the flash directly in my fucking face and flashing me.
[93:20.22]I am three centimeters away from that flash.
[93:35.33]No, hands.
[93:36.15]Okay, cool, we got hands this time.
[93:37.39]Another technician.
[93:58.30]Get we're just kind of on like a walking simulator right now, huh?
[94:00.84]This is just kind of explained me the whole story and then the final boss happens, right?
[94:04.02]Isn't that pretty typical?
[94:14.35]And over here get over here you're a deep shit little girl I
[94:31.07]Oh, fuck.
[94:32.31]What do I need?
[94:36.65]God damn.

[94:38.51]Break it.
[94:38.87]How do I break it?
[94:47.78]I need a knife.
[94:48.62]How the fuck can I get into that?
[95:02.51]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[95:05.33]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[95:12.79]No, no, no, no.

[97:59.19]Son of a gun.
[97:59.82]I don't want to be a family.
[98:11.76]Okay.
[98:17.73]Test subject E001C transport log top secret.
[98:31.62]Holy fuck.
[98:34.48]Mia Winters.
[98:37.58]Are we gonna sit here for, like, five minutes while this loads, or what?
[98:48.71]I'm, like, trying to re-chat right now.
[98:51.55]I'm, like, trying so desperately.
[98:53.11]Alan, you're getting worse.
[99:01.55]She must have infected me during the attack.
[99:06.33]And I'm too far gone anyway.
[99:11.27]He's got a watch too.
[99:16.94]But it serves me right.
[99:19.70]It's my fault she got out.
[99:21.48]Yeah, it is your fault.
[99:23.76]But that doesn't mean I'm going to let you die.
[99:27.98]She didn't attack you.
[99:30.08]It's part of her imprinting protocol.
[99:32.32]I can't believe this is happening.
[99:35.81]Here.
[99:37.31]Take it.
[99:38.35]It has her tissue samples.
[99:40.31]Seven minutes.

[135:17.24]You wouldn't be sweating your ass off right now?
[135:22.30]Doubtful.

[137:11.85]Nothing.
[137:14.21]Shit.
[137:14.57]Remote bomb.
[137:22.42]You're telling me there's no fucking lockpick or anything around here?
[137:24.88]Fuck.

[137:42.39]I guess so.
[137:44.07]Whatever.
[137:45.87]I would really love that weapon.
[137:47.13]I have to come back.
[137:50.79]I can't open that.

[139:06.39]You have no arms.
[139:23.84]Alright, note to self, fight the guys with no hands.
[139:27.44]They're not hard to kill.
[139:31.40]Save point.
[139:38.54]Remember when this game was exciting?
[139:49.21]Yeah, I... This is, uh...
[139:55.42]This part, this last, like, 40 minutes has just been, like... Not, not really.
[140:03.17]Not really, uh... Not really into it.
[140:06.85]As, yeah, I would say.
[140:09.85]This feels very much like filler.
[140:13.23]So the game wouldn't be, like, eight and a half hours long.
[140:17.71]But, you know, that's my opinion.
[140:19.19]Corrosive, there we go.
[140:20.17]I needed that to open one of the doors upstairs.
[140:37.93]Whatever.
[140:39.37]Nothing I can do.
[140:45.68]What are these bombs, though?
[140:50.22]Alright, I could go- I could just go down.
[141:01.39]Whatever, let's just see what happens.

[141:49.85]Can I get down here?
[141:51.45]Does this open?
[141:51.95]Of course it doesn't, right?
[142:01.68]Of course that door wouldn't open.
[142:08.10]Of course not!
[142:09.62]Why would it?
[142:13.24]Oof.
[142:15.22]I can open this door.

[143:45.77]Why can't I see my health?
[143:46.83]I should be able to see it, right?
[143:48.55]Where's my fucking watch?
[144:04.72]Why don't I get a fucking watch?
[144:06.28]She had one on earlier.
[144:07.76]Why is it off?
[144:10.83]That's fucking horseshit.
[144:16.69]Like, I'd love to fucking be able to see my health.
[144:34.84]Fucking just go.
[144:35.70]I'm done.
[144:36.46]Go.
[144:39.47]I think I give a fuck right now.
[144:49.03]This part of the game sucks.
[144:55.50]This part of the game is fucking terrible.
[145:03.22]What, like, what, like, a way to take a fucking great game and make it like a piece of shit.
[145:20.82]I gotta go back into, like, the captain's quarters.
[145:25.76]What a crock of fucking diarrhea.
[145:27.72]Seriously.
[145:28.34]What a crock of shit.
[145:34.43]Where the fuck is it?
[145:35.39]Where's the stupid captain's room to get the corrosive jelly?
[145:37.99]I don't think it was over here, was it?
[145:44.71]I don't even fucking know.
[145:47.34]No, I don't.
[145:49.88]If I could put Game Genie in and skip this part of the game, I would do it.
[146:04.88]Where's the fucking captain's room?
[146:07.30]It's like up, isn't it?
[146:08.14]This is so blurry.
[146:14.39]I can't even see what this is saying.
[146:17.76]Guest room, lounge, bunk room.
[146:20.26]Break room, dining room.
[146:22.43]Oh, lord.
[146:32.65]Captain's cabin.
[146:33.37]It's all the fucking way up top.
[146:36.34]Because didn't I get the corrosive gel there, or did I just get it... I don't even... I have no idea.
[146:48.90]I have fucking no goddamn idea.
[146:51.79]I found it in like one of these rooms.
[147:24.87]Let's try to get the fuck away from this guy.
[147:56.99]Fucking painting puzzle now.
[147:58.21]Oh great, a painting puzzle.
[148:01.14]Oh god.
[148:25.71]I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking at here.
[148:37.36]Ah, well, that's one... That one's in the middle.
[148:44.32]It's over there on the left.
[148:52.09]Nothing in here, right?
[148:54.76]I got a feeling that that key is in there.
[148:56.72]10, 15.
[148:59.91]Did they say anything?
[149:08.11]No.
[149:14.26]How do I not get this?
[149:16.24]I don't understand.
[149:28.31]colorblind?
[149:29.05]What do you mean?
[149:31.15]Do they have to all just be facing the same direction?
[149:34.07]Or what?
[149:38.69]I'm going to assume that.
[149:45.47]I can't turn these ones, so...
[149:59.74]There it is.
[150:05.26]Okay.
[150:06.30]Don't fucking die.
[150:07.70]I need to save it so bad.
[150:10.76]I'm gonna just get out and save it.
[150:16.06]I'm gonna go up all the way to the right.
[150:18.26]Right.
[150:18.82]Use the corrosive.
[150:24.59]He was not even facing this direction.
[150:26.09]Dude wasn't even fucking facing this direction.
[150:29.99]You know what?
[150:31.23]I don't want to fucking die.
[150:32.05]So I'm going to use it.
[150:35.09]Motherfucker not even facing this damn direction.
[150:37.15]He still hits me.
[150:38.67]He's going to bring me to the dining room, right?
[150:44.74]Where is he?
[150:45.12]I'm going to go that way.
[151:07.43]I think I can climb onto that, but I don't want to try at the moment.
[151:10.23]I want to use it here.
[151:13.61]The fuck was that?
[151:14.57]Did you see that?
[151:28.74]Captain's key.
[151:29.50]There we go.
[151:30.92]Can actually get a weapon.
[151:33.28]Gotta love a god before I lose my fucking mind.
[151:39.62]before I actually lose my mind.
[151:41.08]Alright, fourth floor.
[151:50.31]I want to save it though, so we're going straight ahead.
[152:15.44]I'm so done with this area.
[152:18.22]I want to be out of here so fucking bad.
[152:20.10]Alright, gotta go climb the ladder.
[152:31.43]Get the gun.
[152:36.32]Come back down here.
[152:37.52]Save it again.
[153:06.90]Okay.
[153:10.18]Captain's cabin.
[153:14.78]Wait.
[153:17.38]What happened?
[153:22.23]God damn it!
[153:31.27]Don't even fucking do it!
[153:32.71]Don't even do it!
[153:48.99]Alright, now you're all in big, big fucking trouble.
[153:54.92]Is there a safe point up here?
[153:56.28]No.
[153:57.60]Time to go back down.
[153:58.54]That's it, right?
[154:19.26]Okay, back down.
[154:20.46]I guess I could... I'm scared that's gonna... I didn't look over here yet.
[154:31.25]I can run down here, can't I?
[154:34.65]More remote bomb.
[154:38.39]Can't get through that.
[154:39.13]Come on, really?
[154:42.52]Well, we're jumping down again.
[154:45.26]Gonna save it.
[154:47.51]And hopefully get the fuck out of here.
[155:01.36]Closest save point.
[155:02.36]Where is it?
[155:04.02]Right here.
[155:17.10]Hoo-wee!
[155:24.93]This is a shitshow.
[155:30.99]Alright, now we gotta go down to the bottom floor.
[155:35.30]We have something to defend ourselves with at least, right?
[155:48.93]Um, I just want to open this.
[155:51.47]Can I get it open from here?
[155:52.47]No.
[155:53.63]Figured maybe I could push it open from that other side.
[155:55.65]This is it, right?
[156:22.31]Alright, alright.
[156:23.45]This... What the fuck?
[156:26.55]Where is he?
[156:28.05]He's right there, okay.
[156:47.06]Why do you have so much fucking health?
[156:52.79]That guy... Why do you have that much HP?
[156:57.45]What am I looking at?
[156:58.01]That guy was a real pain in the ass.
[157:01.73]I think that's it.
[157:17.07]Right.
[157:19.11]Wanted to use the corrosive on this door.
[157:22.59]But there's another guy that hangs out over here.
[157:29.15]Yeah, there he is.
[157:47.25]Backpack.
[157:52.62]Well, that's good.
[157:56.54]More corrosive goo.
[158:00.40]More bombs.
[158:03.35]I'm not really using these that often.
[158:04.77]I probably should, right?
[158:07.23]No, I don't even know how to use them.
[158:08.33]I'm going to end up... Ready?
[158:09.65]Here's my production.
[158:10.41]I'm going to... Hold on.
[158:12.51]Sorry.
[158:15.19]Alright.
[158:15.99]I'm definitely going to end up blowing myself up with one of these remote bombs.
[158:34.05]I thought that was gonna make machine gun ammo for I don't know why.
[158:37.17]I just figured because I'm playing as like a different character or something.
[158:42.73]Fuck me.
[158:44.97]Fuck me.
[159:13.77]Well, at least I got one of those.
[159:19.54]Whoa!
[159:21.12]That's a lot of text.
[159:21.96]Alright, there's a monster.
[159:29.60]There's a scary monster coming.
[159:43.79]Oh, you asshole.
[159:47.41]You fucking asshole.
[159:53.62]How could you?
[159:54.66]And where did he go?
[159:55.34]I don't know.
[160:06.84]I don't know what I just did.
[160:07.70]I don't know what I'm doing.
[160:08.88]Apparently I climbed up and I still need this shit.
[160:41.13]Oh, there's a handgun.
[160:44.13]Am I just decking this girl out now for the rest of the time I play the game?
[160:49.91]Apparently.
[160:51.87]Nothing else, right?
[160:58.58]I've got to be getting close, right?
[161:00.08]I have to be.
[161:03.44]I feel like I'm very close to the very end of the game.
[161:06.36]There's going to be one last super boss that I have to shoot one rocket at.
[161:09.70]One rocket.
[161:11.02]And it does a cutscene and it explodes and we escape.
[161:16.48]I think.
[161:17.56]I don't know.
[161:17.96]How do I get down to the next floor, though?
[161:31.13]Like... I feel like I'm missing something here.
[161:36.05]I'm definitely missing something.
[161:38.66]There's a fuse.
[161:39.98]Where's the other one?
[161:44.59]Where is the other thing that I need?
[161:49.67]We're gonna go on a wild fucking goose chase.
[161:56.21]We're gonna go on a wild goose chase for this thing, aren't we?
[162:09.85]What is this thing?
[162:14.21]I'm missing a cable.
[162:21.97]Son of a gun.
[162:24.57]I need to find a cable.
[162:26.73]Where... Where is there a cable?
[162:35.04]I probably went by it a couple times or something.
[163:02.00]I'm starting to break out on my forehead from this.
[163:06.76]Am I in another VHS?
[163:08.42]No, I am not currently in a VHS.
[163:12.19]This is the game.
[163:24.16]Not scary anymore.
[163:29.38]Read... Oh, it was on the note.
[163:31.32]Fuck me.
[163:33.12]Well, what did it say?
[163:33.88]Because I don't want to go back and read the fucking note.
[163:45.19]Yeah, the mansion was much cooler.
[163:46.77]The mansion was much more interesting and scary.
[163:48.49]This is just like generic horror movie boat.
[163:50.43]You know what I mean?
[163:54.54]Like, this is just like, hey, look out, we're on like a dark, scary horror movie boat.
[164:01.24]And it's very boring, and I think this is very bad.
[164:04.40]Alright, let's just go.
[164:13.83]I find this area of the game to be just straight up bad.
[164:17.75]It's the only complaint, really, I've had about this entire game.
[164:22.19]is that I think this is is just I just this is I don't I never like like this running around doing like fetch quests and not really a whole lot going on the boring area third floor sick bay okay well let's go to the third floor
[164:51.32]It's a lot of just going up and down, up and down.
[164:53.58]Eh, you know.
[165:01.29]Sickbay.
[165:03.53]Corrosive.
[165:04.79]Do I have corrosive?
[165:05.97]I do.
[165:16.73]Can't open this because I don't have anything.
[165:18.79]Oh well.
[165:22.71]Let's get the cave.
[165:37.74]And let's hopefully get out of here.
[165:39.44]Can't open that?
[165:59.18]Here comes Evelyn.
[166:00.49]She's gonna jump right in front of me.

[166:07.30]Cable?
[166:08.48]What is that?
[166:08.90]Why is there a trip wire here?
[166:13.70]Am I just freaking out for no reason or is there like a trip wire right there?
[166:25.69]I don't know.

[169:33.44]Definitely save the game.
[169:35.48]After all that nonsense.
[169:36.68]I ain't doing that shit again.
[169:37.94]You know that for certain.
[169:42.53]I wonder if I should heal.

[171:25.41]I'm gonna miss stuff, but whatever.
[171:26.81]I gotta readjust my face.
[171:28.61]I'm healing.

[172:33.49]Machine gun ammo.
[172:59.98]Run the fuck away!
[173:11.48]Hand gunning was a bad idea.
[173:13.60]But at least I didn't, whatever.
[173:22.09]Come on down!
[173:23.67]Come on down!
[173:28.25]Come on down, buddy!
[173:34.79]Is he dead?

[174:06.23]What did I miss?
[174:06.71]Nothing?
[174:19.00]Come on, I get the magnum now.
[174:21.88]If that even matters anymore.
[174:32.87]Stay right there.
[174:35.91]Stay right there.
[174:37.21]Don't go anywhere.
[174:47.44]Don't go anywhere.
[174:48.92]Cutscene.
[175:08.25]Ethan?
[175:13.25]Ethan?
[175:13.57]No shit.
[175:15.93]Hey, shh, shh, shh.
[175:17.17]I know, I know, I know.
[175:18.97]I'm not gonna hurt you.
[175:20.97]Hell, I never would have if I could have helped you.
[175:23.85]What do you mean?
[175:25.37]I'm no killer, son.
[175:27.58]Neither is Marguerite, nor my boy Lucas, or even Zoe here.
[175:38.54]She did this.
[175:39.98]What the hell is she?
[175:41.31]And what did she do to you?
[175:45.69]She infected us with her gift.
[175:48.63]That's what she calls it.
[175:51.95]I found her near a busted out tank in the bayou.
[175:58.43]Everything changed after that.
[176:00.93]So she infects you and then she takes control?
[176:03.21]No.
[176:05.55]Not exactly, son.
[176:08.51]She just, she forces a way into your mind, your soul.
[176:16.12]What are you doing over there?
[176:17.06]I can see you.
[176:19.06]I can't fight back.
[176:22.68]You are connected to her and you can't resist the urge to.
[176:32.06]Oh, you're a different person after that.
[176:35.20]Just like Mia.
[176:36.74]So Mia sent me that message because of Evelyn.
[176:40.40]Listen, the girl just wants a family of her own.
[176:47.58]She's the key, alright?
[176:50.66]You find her and you stop her.
[176:55.58]Okay, Dad.
[176:56.06]Ethan.
[177:00.26]Free my family.
[177:03.52]Please.
[177:04.68]When did this happen?
[177:05.60]Is this happening, like, right now?
[177:06.69]Or did this happen, like, three days ago?
[177:08.97]Evelyn, stay away from him.
[177:17.89]Why?
[177:18.09]He doesn't love you.
[177:20.31]I can make him love you.
[177:24.15]Don't hurt him.
[177:25.03]That's me in the goo.
[177:25.87]I told you I'm not going to hurt him.
[177:29.71]Don't you dare.
[177:31.91]So what?
[177:35.23]You're not my mom.
[177:37.17]Remember?
[177:43.70]I'm still in here.
[177:44.58]Can you let me out?
[178:00.23]There's no time.
[178:02.18]you have to get out of here and find her here take this what are you doing I don't know what's going on I won't be able to resist for much longer what are you talking about
[178:31.18]I thought I was supposed to save her.
[178:32.66]I thought I saved her.
[178:36.92]Where's all my... Hey, uh... Can you give me the guns you picked up, sweetheart?
[178:44.42]You know, all that cool shit you have in your pockets.
[178:47.18]Can I have it?
[178:50.66]Okay.
[178:50.76]Okay, you little bitch.
[179:18.34]It's the final battle.
[179:20.98]Alright, let's do it.
[179:21.54]Let's do the final battle.
[179:32.63]Um... I actually was kind of just coming up for a second to make sure that people weren't fucking screaming.
[179:38.77]Like, yelling at me.
[179:40.69]Because, like, I missed the box with all my shit in it.
[179:45.13]Just making sure that's not the case.
[179:48.10]Doesn't seem like it's the case.
[179:52.99]Looks like we're going down.
[180:02.01]Here we go.
[180:08.59]Oh, cool, cool silo.
[180:10.38]Nice silo.
[180:12.90]Interesting silo.
[180:14.48]Now we're on, like, Mars.
[180:15.44]We're on the fucking ant planet.
[180:18.72]Mm-hmm.
[180:19.84]Remember this level in Half-Life 2?
[180:22.29]It was fucked up.
[180:25.01]Ew.
[181:08.65]We're... We're good.
[181:10.69]Don't worry.
[181:11.17]We're fine.
[181:12.79]We're gonna be fine.
[181:15.11]It's like inching my neck up trying to catch the, uh... Abercrombie salt mine.
[181:32.24]Are they watching us from that helicopter?
[181:37.46]Alpha 1, this is Bravo 1.
[181:38.60]Do you read?
[181:39.94]This is Alpha 1.
[181:40.90]Report.
[181:41.46]Did you find anything?
[181:43.01]A thorough search of the Baker property revealed zero survivors.
[181:46.59]Zero survivors.
[181:47.53]We did find evidence of a skirmish.
[181:50.31]Evelyn?
[181:51.39]Negative.
[181:52.53]However, we did find several encrypted messages from the Baker's son, Lucas, to an unknown third party.
[181:57.46]You can probably guess who that was.
[181:59.20]Jesus.
[181:59.84]That's just great.
[182:01.96]We've had reports he's in the abandoned mine south of the property.
[182:04.58]I'm gonna go have a look.
[182:06.41]Hmm.
[182:06.65]Machine gun.
[182:07.33]Hold on.
[182:07.59]Where's the, uh... What do you call a magnum?
[182:35.08]44 mag.
[182:35.48]Oh, steroids.
[182:36.84]44 magnum.
[182:37.38]Let's do it.
[182:37.84]Let's get this fucking thing.
[182:40.76]Let's blow somebody's face off.
[182:48.40]44 magnum.
[182:50.72]Boink.
[182:52.67]Don't accidentally shoot it.
[182:57.67]I'm gonna accidentally shoot it.
[183:06.32]What the fuck do I want?
[183:14.27]Do I need corrosive still?
[183:15.41]I'm gonna take the remote bombs.
[183:19.98]Fuck.
[183:33.73]Burner.
[183:35.05]Magnum.
[183:35.67]Shotgun.
[183:37.00]Explosives.
[183:53.31]I'm going to get rid of the burner.
[184:00.76]For now.
[184:09.31]Machine gun ammo.
[184:10.39]I have a lot of machine gun ammo.
[184:11.39]Might as well take it, right?
[184:16.61]Take the knife.
[184:17.25]Okay, I got a lot of healing.
[184:21.31]Okay, I'm good to go.
[184:22.29]I think I'll be okay.
[184:25.07]I think I'm gonna be alright.
[184:28.56]Right?
[184:28.78]I think I'm gonna be okay.
[184:31.94]Not a faithful pyro.
[184:42.84]It's like he's reading chat.
[184:44.06]Well, I'm not.
[184:46.72]Can I make more magnum ammo with the gunpowder?
[184:48.74]I don't know.
[184:49.25]Can I?
[184:52.37]Can I do that?
[184:57.79]This part sucks.
[184:58.59]The game gets cheap as fuck.
[185:00.49]Oh, well, that's not good to know.
[185:08.20]Shoot the boss?
[185:10.50]I plan on it.
[185:13.33]Take the knife for boxes.
[185:14.37]I got the knife here.
[185:19.31]Well, whatever.
[185:19.83]Let's just see what happens.
[185:21.93]Machine gun, shotgun should do enough for me.
[185:24.97]And then the magnum is going to be just destructive.
[185:31.91]Let's just go.
[185:32.33]I think I'm good.
[185:34.59]I think I've got pretty much everything I need.
[185:37.43]At least for now.
[185:41.06]And let's make sure I know where these are.
[185:42.36]Machine.
[185:42.54]We're going to have the machine gun out.
[185:43.72]We're going to use the machine gun predominantly, I think.
[185:46.40]I like it a lot.
[185:48.74]And let's go.
[185:49.34]I've got a lot of chems.
[185:59.07]I'm going to call them chems.
[186:21.77]Perfect people to test my new guns out on, huh?
[186:24.03]There's a lot of you.
[186:36.28]That was annoying.
[186:58.55]We're gonna do that again.
[187:13.13]I'll show you why.
[187:36.59]Could have done that better.
[187:41.99]Don't even need to use any ammo.
[187:45.96]And... Oh!
[188:09.50]Fuck, I need a knife.
[188:13.06]What are you doing, bro?
[188:13.80]What are you doing, bro?
[188:16.06]Bro?
[188:17.30]Excuse me!
[188:29.97]What the?
[188:30.49]What?
[188:32.21]What?
[188:39.06]I was- I was trying to- Okay, that's a- Not a good idea.
[188:46.13]That turned out to be not a great idea.
[188:49.91]Turned out to be not the best fucking idea I've ever had.
[188:53.35]Turns out- Ooh, what a good fucking idea!
[188:57.23]What an idea!
[189:05.01]What an idea!
[189:05.79]I used- I used nine shots, guys.
[189:17.02]What an idea!
[189:40.45]One shot, one... One shot, one kill.
[189:45.41]Beautiful.
[190:00.18]Fuck the knife.
[190:03.96]Must be a psycho.
[190:04.98]I'm okay with being a psycho.
[190:10.56]Oh no, where are you?
[190:12.08]These guys fucking suck.
[190:34.58]Okay, let's take a look.
[190:41.68]I have plenty of healing.
[190:42.46]Let's keep going.
[190:55.44]Won't be long now.
[191:45.64]Fuck man.
[191:46.96]Oh, that's a fucking annoying Pulling out the wrong fucking eye.
[191:55.01]Oh god.
[191:55.81]Oh
[191:59.01]Guy walks forward.
[192:00.63]There's a fucking guy there.
[192:03.05]All of a sudden, there's two other enemies right behind you, hitting you.
[192:08.62]Fucking... Stupid-ass bullshit.
[192:12.96]It's a crock of fucking shit.
[192:14.98]It ain't scary.
[192:16.16]It's fucking annoying.
[192:21.16]And there's a guy in front of you.
[192:22.44]There's actually two guys behind you now, right now!
[192:26.30]Fuck off.
[192:31.48]Wasn't that scary?
[193:12.90]Where is he?
[193:13.56]Come on.
[193:18.42]Where are you?
[193:37.63]Son of a bitch!
[193:41.53]Fuck.
[193:44.67]I gotta get this guy in one shot in the face.
[193:46.55]And then, hold on.
[193:47.67]Wait, wait, wait for these guys.
[193:49.73]Here they come.
[193:51.11]Watch out for this guy.
[193:51.75]The guy behind you now.
[193:59.15]Fuck you.
[194:10.42]Let's see what's down here besides the giant snake.
[194:18.00]What are those?
[194:24.36]Handgun ammo, what was that?
[194:25.49]That was handgun ammo?
[194:27.99]I thought it was shotgun ammo.
[194:32.99]Apparently not.
[194:33.61]Okay, I need,
[194:42.64]I should probably heal right now, but I'm an idiot and I'm not going to.
[194:46.18]Maybe I will.
[195:00.01]Should I?
[195:00.39]I don't know.
[195:06.29]Maybe I should.
[195:10.38]Depends on what...
[195:13.60]See?
[195:14.20]Fuck you.
[195:14.85]Fuck you.
[195:15.49]Fuck you, game.
[195:16.55]Fuck you.
[195:18.61]No.
[195:22.09]Like, this is what I was just talking about.
[195:23.69]I was just fucking complaining about this.
[195:25.57]I'm just talking shit about this.
[195:36.90]Do it!
[195:50.12]That's so stupid.
[196:11.58]Do it, Anakin.
[196:15.02]Do it.
[196:16.50]Do it.
[196:17.72]Do it, Anakin.
[196:20.20]Do it.
[196:21.47]They're gonna be right here.
[196:23.53]Hey, we're gonna be up behind you.
[196:26.13]Be careful.
[196:26.99]There's always gonna be a guy behind you.
[196:33.71]They just won't be behind you.
[196:34.79]They'll be right up in your shit.
[196:41.04]Do it!
[196:51.61]That's very out of focus.
[196:53.05]Is this like fucking Castle Griffinsteed?
[197:01.97]Like, honest to God.
[197:02.87]We're in like the mines.
[197:20.40]Shotgun... Yeah, fuck the knife.
[197:26.53]Who needs a knife, right?
[198:05.56]fucking angry right now.
[198:26.97]Uh, thanks to you guys, it's been about a week since my head's been clear and back.
[198:30.05]Yeah, okay.
[198:32.25]Stupid.
[198:33.47]Mom and dad are still totally under, though.
[198:35.33]And I was wondering, is this whole family obsession something you guys program into her?
[198:39.04]It's kind of fucked up.
[198:41.16]That bitch Mia is still somewhere in between Evie La La Land and Reality.
[198:45.80]I nominated her for 12 Oscars.
[198:48.10]She gets pretty violent, so I locked her up in a cell.
[198:51.44]Thought maybe Evelyn would get mad since Mia's her favorite and all, but she doesn't seem to care.
[198:55.59]She actually goes and visits her sometimes.
[198:57.21]She thinks Mia's her mommy.
[198:59.61]Your bioweapon is fucked up.
[199:01.41]Family obsession is getting out of hand.
[199:04.95]Mm-hmm.
[199:12.18]By the way, Evie's looking sick or something.
[199:13.90]Her skin's getting wrinkly.
[199:16.00]She's getting old.
[199:26.66]Okay.
[199:27.68]I wish there was a save point.
[199:28.79]There is a save point right over here.
[199:38.49]Oh, it's a picture of... More of this report.
[199:42.31]Yeah, she's a weapon.
[199:44.71]We made her out of plants.
[199:46.25]She's a plant slash virus person.
[199:49.94]And she has a bunch of different, like, people in her.
[199:52.36]There's a bunch of different, like, personalities in her.
[199:56.16]And she loves her family.
[199:58.96]And she's a bioweapon.
[200:00.86]I just read it.
[200:05.47]Ten minutes after dose, death.
[200:08.81]Twelve minutes after dose, cell modification.
[200:12.55]E-necrotoxin.
[200:14.35]E-necrotoxin.
[200:17.69]E-Necrotoxin.
[200:19.98]E-series dosage test.
[200:21.30]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[200:22.00]Five minutes after.
[200:24.34]There it is.
[200:24.66]What do I like?
[200:30.64]It's in the box.
[200:45.03]Huh?
[200:52.57]Let me just look around the room one more time.
[200:55.55]Yeah, there's more documents.
[200:57.12]Oh, this one's a doozy.
[201:04.58]Somebody will screenshot those and read them.
[201:14.07]Strictly... Fungus... Fungus and... We found multiple times... There's a... There's... Somebody screenshot that.
[201:23.23]Somebody read that later.
[201:25.83]Screenshot that.
[201:26.73]Send that to me on Twitter.
[201:27.61]I'll fucking... I'll read it later.
[201:29.47]I'll read it like... In bed.
[201:33.23]Save this before I do anything.
[201:34.37]Because I'm scared this is going to start like an... Irreversible cutscene.
[201:37.48]So... And they're giving me flame rounds.
[201:40.82]Which means... You're probably...
[201:45.00]Probably want me to use the grenade launcher at this point.
[201:48.78]So, let's get rid of... I don't fucking know.
[201:59.17]Machine gun?
[202:01.41]Shotgun?
[202:02.97]Let's ditch the shotgun.
[202:06.45]Any shotgun shells in here?
[202:07.85]No.
[202:16.55]Got two shots.
[202:19.89]Ditch the handgun ammo.
[202:24.61]I have so many of these bombs.
[202:33.01]What do I make with this, by the way?
[202:36.97]Never mind, I'm a stupid idiot.
[202:40.94]With the strong fluid...
[202:44.71]And gunpowder.
[202:45.33]What does it make?
[202:45.99]Enhanced handgun ammo.
[202:47.11]Okay.
[202:49.75]Don't want it.
[202:54.84]Okie dokie.
[203:01.68]Let's go do it.
[203:09.78]The World Series has been spoiled?
[203:19.61]The Cubs won the World Series?
[203:21.63]What are you, what's going on?
[203:23.81]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[203:27.59]So many endings.
[203:30.23]Wait, are you guys just like spoiling endings of shit?
[203:32.49]Don't do that.
[203:34.01]Don't, well, the Cubs won, of course the Cubs won the fucking World Series.
[203:40.20]That's not a spoiler, that's like a sporting event.
[203:43.70]That happened already.
[203:44.54]Alright, let's open it up.
[203:46.56]Let's see what she's got.
[203:49.30]And let's dump in the amino acid.
[204:04.11]Okay, so I have to, like, inject Evelyn with this thing, I think, right?
[204:18.38]Now what the fuck do I do?
[204:22.68]This door didn't open before, well... Save it.
[204:34.55]Evelyn!
[204:44.39]Alright.
[204:46.58]What is left?
[204:51.11]That big elaborate door will open.
[204:53.17]I hear a monster.
[204:54.01]Against handgun ammo.
[205:00.19]Down to the left.
[205:09.33]Right.
[205:10.59]Okay.
[205:12.65]There's going to be like a tunnel monster that's going to jump up right now.
[205:20.44]I've got a lot of random fucking equipment that I can't use.
[205:34.04]Evelynn!
[205:38.15]Evelynn, I just need to give you a booster shot!
[205:42.61]Just want to make sure you don't get measles, mumps, and rumbella!
[205:52.99]It'll only hurt for a second.
[205:56.11]I promise.
[206:05.07]What national anthem is that?
[206:09.53]Oh, Canada.
[206:12.73]Your home is sacred island.
[206:18.52]Two once was four.
[206:22.08]The end of die- I don't remember die being in the Canadian National Anthem.
[206:28.81]I don't remember that being in the National Anthem.
[206:41.20]Excuse me.
[206:42.62]Excuse me!
[207:12.26]Go!
[207:13.22]Fuck it, don't fight these things.
[207:14.60]No rea- Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[207:18.94]Improvise, improvisation, improvisation, improvisation, improvisation, improvisation, improvisation!
[207:35.62]It would have worked if I could just fucking heal.
[207:46.64]That worked, but like one of those motherfuckers was still alive right next to me and didn't get hurt at all.
[207:58.61]What?
[208:00.27]F word.
[208:01.91]Seriously.
[208:09.86]Of course there's going to be a guy stuffing up the tunnel.
[208:13.70]There has to be a guy that's going to fill the fucking tunnel with his body.
[208:17.38]In the tiny little tunnel.
[208:20.22]Why wouldn't it be like that?
[208:21.76]Fuck!
[208:26.10]Just go.
[208:26.76]I'm not fucking stopping for anything.
[208:28.28]Fuck!
[208:42.08]I gotta kill these guys.
[208:44.14]These guys have to die.
[209:20.62]Alright.
[209:32.00]Fucking shotgun shells.
[209:34.22]Bad guy right here, right?
[209:36.20]Check it.
[209:37.21]Check it!
[210:01.61]I'm so turned around.
[210:03.09]Go, go, go.
[210:37.54]Travis I'm like out of fucking bullets I'm out of fucking ammo
[211:09.16]I have enough for like one more guy.
[211:10.77]I'm gonna have to just run.
[211:11.47]Oh, I thought that was like a super weapon.
[211:22.89]I thought that was like an ultra flashlight.
[211:30.90]Why am I walking so slow?
[211:35.90]That's my health.
[211:36.70]I'm okay.
[211:55.24]Get over here, you fucking no-good!
[211:57.49]Just keep moving up!
[212:06.09]Oh!
[212:06.79]What the fuck?
[212:27.11]How's my health?
[212:28.21]Heal.
[212:44.76]Shit!
[212:47.66]Eat!
[212:54.34]Ah!
[212:58.76]Eat this, you motherfucker!
[213:01.74]See ya in hell!
[213:09.02]See ya in fuckin' hell!
[213:24.63]Hey, guys.
[213:27.31]Say hi to the fucking devil for me, right?
[213:30.35]I want to see the Twitch chat pogchamping it up.
[213:33.96]You know what I'm saying?
[213:49.55]Let's go.
[213:51.03]Let's go.
[213:52.17]Let's go.
[213:53.77]Resident Evil.
[213:55.09]Resident Evil.
[214:07.05]And I still got two shots in my fucking super launcher.
[214:10.03]Alright, um... Shotgun shells.
[214:14.72]I'm gonna put the shotgun on.
[214:15.94]Woo!
[214:18.56]I am amped up after that one.
[214:23.78]Shotgun shells.
[214:24.48]They really want me to use the shotgun, huh?
[214:27.93]Make sure I didn't miss anything.
[214:30.55]I'm bound to, you know.
[214:32.05]I am bound to.
[214:35.17]Alright, let's go.
[214:39.01]That was the last boss of the game.
[214:40.15]It was just a super booger puker.
[215:01.98]Okay.
[215:04.54]Hmm.
[215:09.18]Dark.
[215:10.18]A little too dark for my liking.
[215:13.98]A little squeeze hole.
[215:16.78]Hopefully there's a save point right here.
[215:23.69]Yes, there is.
[215:24.27]Thank God.
[215:32.86]Mine map.
[215:35.08]Why do they give you this shit when you're about to leave?
[215:39.18]I'm leaving right now.
[215:40.00]You couldn't have gave that to me like fucking 10 minutes ago?
[215:42.40]20 minutes ago?
[215:43.32]How we doing?
[215:57.17]How we doing, guys?
[216:07.38]What if I have a grandma?
[216:09.30]I see this chair.
[216:10.42]I don't see grandma.
[216:13.77]Anything?
[216:14.69]Any secret codes or something?
[216:17.77]No.
[216:20.01]You know Resident Evil, sometimes there's like a fucking secret code on somebody.
[216:43.47]Oh, Tom Brady!
[216:47.15]You thought I was gonna miss the Tom Brady statue, didn't you guys?
[216:49.08]Nope.
[217:01.26]Yeah, there's Grandma.
[217:04.60]Grandma's gonna be in here, isn't she?
[217:05.96]And she's gonna tell me the whole story.
[217:09.82]You don't understand.
[217:12.04]I've been sitting here for 25,000 years.
[217:17.56]They built this house where the fucking dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
[217:22.95]I have dinosaur blood.
[217:24.57]What the fuck?
[217:29.03]They tried to meld me with a fucking rhinoceros.
[217:55.80]What?
[217:56.66]Stop looking at me.
[217:58.06]Don't look at me.
[217:59.46]You ready to fucking sit?
[218:01.27]This is your fault.
[218:04.21]Why am I seeing this?
[218:15.92]Okay.
[218:20.38]Anything in here?
[218:22.84]I thought that was a guitar.
[218:25.00]You want to see the guitar?
[218:27.26]Take a look at the guitar.
[218:29.72]You see it?

[218:52.78]This is the very beginning of the game, from what I remember.
[219:00.69]I'm, like, looking around all over the place for, like, weapons and shit, but this is just, this is the ending cutscene.
[219:11.86]It's okay.
[219:13.16]It's okay.
[219:13.46]It's me.

[239:11.49]Oh, yes.
[239:12.53]Oh, nice work.
[239:15.25]It's gonna be Albert Wesker.
[239:16.15]It's gonna be fucking Wesker.
[239:17.09]I knew it.
[239:19.33]I knew it.
[239:21.47]He's gonna fucking take this.
[239:22.45]It's gonna be Wesker.
[239:23.05]I knew it.
[239:25.67]I knew it.
[239:26.46]It's fucking Albert Wesker.
[239:27.62]Oh.
[239:27.68]Glad we found you.
[239:34.33]What the fuck took you guys so long?
[239:46.84]And then it just turned into a cool little obstacle course for children.
[239:50.12]She just slides out the door and falls out.
[239:56.69]I'm glad.
[239:58.99]Did I?
[240:11.43]And we're all a big happy... They say one door closes, another opens.
[240:16.29]Well, a door closed tonight.
[240:20.67]And what a long night it was.
[240:22.85]But not just for me.
[240:25.61]Me and I weren't the only victims here.
[240:27.78]They say one door closes.
[240:28.74]So were the bakers.
[240:30.76]It was that thing, Evelyn, who made them that way.
[240:36.90]But now Evelyn's dead.
[240:40.21]And these guys are here to clean up the mess.
[240:41.73]That's so funny.
[240:44.07]They say Wunderklus.
[240:45.61]Now she's back and wants to start over.
[240:49.57]Oh, look at that fucking typo.
[240:51.13]Nice typo, Capcom.
[240:54.43]Maybe this is where the next door opens.
[240:56.16]Nice typo.
[240:57.06]Apostrophe, like, space, space, space, S. Oh!
[241:07.64]Alright.
[241:10.26]Wait, hold on, hold on, wait.
[241:13.38]What's it doing?
[241:18.42]Something else.
[241:19.63]Albert Wesker.
[241:20.23]Oh, it's just the credits.
[241:45.56]Well.
[241:52.77]Well, thank you guys for watching.
[241:54.73]That's it.
[241:57.45]Skipped.
[242:16.33]Alright.
[242:19.79]Well, the first half of that game was fucking incredible.
[242:25.16]The first like four or five hours were really, really, really fucking cool and really scary.
[242:32.67]I think they kind of just really dragged that shit out near the end there.
[242:41.88]I feel like they had this really, really awesome, cool game that was inside of the mansion, inside of like the... Hold on.
[242:54.19]What is it?
[242:54.59]What's going on?
[242:57.11]Difficulty, normal.
[242:58.93]Oh, here's the total play time.
[242:59.99]Okay.
[243:01.89]Normal difficulty, nine hours and 56 minutes, just about 10 hours.
[243:06.21]29 restarts.
[243:10.01]4 out of 20 Tom, of course 4 out of 20 Tom Brady's, okay.
[243:12.98]9 out of 18 coins.
[243:17.50]Healing items you use, stabilizes you, only 1.
[243:19.72]Cool.
[243:23.99]Difficulty Madhouse unlocked and you unlock the Albert.
[243:28.79]Secrets of Defense will be added to the okay.
[243:32.35]Cool.
[243:35.31]Oh, additional free content!
[243:40.76]It's not even here yet.
[243:41.80]I thought I was like ready to play it Alright, yeah, that's it.
[243:51.05]I mean my my verdict on the game is It was a really really great experience like I kind of got cut off there by that but The first five to six hours of this game was fucking fantastic
[244:09.28]But I think that they kind of just ran out of content to put in the mansion.
[244:14.32]So, they're like, well, we could have, like, a six-hour long game, or we could add, like, a fucking salt mine and, like, an underwater boat shit sewer level.
[244:26.23]I thought it was great, though.
[244:27.03]I thought it was fun.
[244:27.63]Like, besides, like, kind of the frustrating, like, 75% of the way through the game, I thought it was great.
[244:36.75]I hope it was fun to watch it in VR, because the whole entire thing was played in VR.
[244:40.52]If you just caught the stream tonight for some reason.
[244:44.22]If you go back and watch the VODs, the entire, I played every single second of the game in VR.
[244:49.51]So, yeah, it was a lot of fun.
[244:53.40]And that's going to wrap it up for me.
[244:56.32]Again, sorry I couldn't read or see any bits or donations, any subs, anything like that.
[245:01.64]I just had notifications off because I wanted to completely and totally immerse myself in VR.
[245:06.82]So... Thank you guys so much for watching.
[245:11.82]I'll talk to you guys on Tuesday.
[245:14.29]Tuesday is the next scheduled stream.
[245:15.55]Probably going to try to play For Honor.
[245:19.57]When a door closes, another one opens.
[245:25.09]You took one second of a step with the helm off?
[245:27.27]Oh, well.
[245:29.01]But I would recommend it if you like... I mean, it definitely goes back to the roots of what Resident Evil was, and that's supposed to be terrifying, scary games.
[245:39.36]Yeah, we'll see.
[245:39.72]Tuesday will either be For Honor or...
[245:42.28]I might do something else.
[245:43.82]I feel like I should get my money's worth for the VR.
[245:47.31]So expect more like random PSVR shit in the future because I did just kind of get it for Resident Evil 7 but I would like to you know play more games on stream because I don't want to just play one game in VR ever.
[246:04.74]But take care, guys.
[246:05.98]I'll see you all soon.
[246:06.62]See you all on Tuesday.
[246:07.54]Hope you guys enjoyed the stream.
[246:09.59]And I'll see you guys Tuesday.
[246:10.57]Take care.
[246:11.67]Goodbye.
[246:12.47]Good luck.
[246:13.41]Thanks for watching.
[246:22.43]Goodbye.
[247:03.77]Thank you.
