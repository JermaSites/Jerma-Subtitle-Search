[00:01.56]Somebody said he fell in the toilet again.
[00:03.44]I just imagine how that would play out.
[00:09.20]Like butt sinks in, arms and legs both sticking out, wiggling.
[00:18.13]Everybody help, I'm stuck!
[00:22.25]That's not possible.
[00:22.95]Maybe he had a tiny little toilet.
[00:29.13]Like reaching with my index finger to try to press a text on the phone that's in my other hand.
[00:38.79]Send plunger.
[00:42.70]Or just go live like that and not even fucking care.
[00:54.58]Why are you live?
[00:59.47]Why not?
[01:05.55]My birthday was great.
[01:07.63]I had a very good time on my birthday.
[01:08.95]I went out to dinner.
[01:11.48]Had some snacks.
[01:14.58]It was actually very good.
[01:15.48]It was very nice.
[01:16.00]I have one problem, though.
[01:25.33]I got this...
[01:27.88]I got this... I don't even know where it came from.
[01:29.52]Okay, I want some medical professionals in the chat here to tell me what... Hold on, let me tweet this out first.
[01:39.23]Okay.
[01:40.33]So, I... My hand... My hands have been immaculately clean.
[01:46.03]And perfect.
[01:47.15]Just baby soft.
[01:49.00]Since I was a teenager.
[01:51.53]I've never had a single problem with my hands.
[01:53.83]They have been delicate, they've been strong, no calluses, no warts.
[01:59.10]Until, uh, until yesterday.
[02:02.42]What happened?
[02:04.52]I think I have a- I think I know what happened, but let me just keep going.
[02:07.26]Uh, there's a- I got a wart on my finger!
[02:13.18]And it happened the day after my 35th birthday.
[02:18.48]So I got one of those things, and I was like, what the fuck is going on?
[02:21.72]This is bullshit.
[02:22.48]Why do I have a ward on my finger?
[02:25.28]I've never had a single growth, ever, like I said.
[02:28.15]So I went and got one of those freezing kits.
[02:31.69]I freaked out, and I was like, I have to freeze this thing off.
[02:36.87]I got one of those liquid nitrogen little, like...
[02:45.55]You don't get an STD on your finger Okay, that's not what it's not look at how what's the definition of that word?
[02:57.51]Your fingers are not a sexual organ I have an STD on my hand That's not what that means
[03:14.86]They are, though.
[03:15.98]What are you talking about?
[03:17.16]They are.
[03:24.77]Omega Lull.
[03:26.75]Tell the STD story.
[03:34.37]No, I looked this all up.
[03:36.18]Apparently, like, this is why I don't like to touch anything.
[03:40.62]It's like a VI- You can, like, I don't know, touch, like, a door handle that somebody touched.
[03:44.95]Touch like a... Touch like a surface.
[03:47.69]This is why I don't touch anything.
[03:53.05]The day after my 35th birthday.
[03:54.43]Bang.
[03:54.71]You have water on your hand.
[03:56.13]And now I've freezed it off.
[03:57.01]And now it hurts.
[03:58.75]So my gamer finger.
[04:00.01]And by the way.
[04:00.73]Debilitating retirement incoming.
[04:03.71]It's on my gamer finger.
[04:05.13]It's right where it sits.
[04:06.61]Like on the fucking mouse.
[04:11.15]Like barely.
[04:11.65]Barely.
[04:14.01]And I know everyone's going to say, show it.
[04:15.43]I don't want to show it because it's disgusting.
[04:17.39]And I will never, I will not show this.
[04:22.43]So, okay.
[04:23.65]If I click very gently today, you know why that is.
[04:27.47]I'm not going to show it.
[04:28.20]No, I'm not going to.
[04:29.32]It's revolting and I hate it.
[04:30.48]I don't like showing gross things on my body.
[04:32.36]No, I don't want to.
[04:33.74]I'm not going to do it.
[04:34.94]I can't.
[04:35.32]I won't do it.
[04:38.14]Okay, what if I blur the camera?
[04:39.98]Okay, what if I censor it?
[04:42.95]Hold on.
[04:45.75]Anyway, let's just go over what we're doing.
[04:49.62]We're going to be playing The Long Drive today.
[04:51.66]We're going to play Left 4 Dead today, but I had a bunch of scheduling conflicts.
[04:55.70]So we're not going to do that today.
[04:56.74]We're going to do it maybe another time.
[04:58.28]Who knows?
[04:58.78]I don't know.
[05:00.20]You know as good as I do right now.
[05:03.34]Tomorrow, I'm going to be on Kit Boga's stream.
[05:07.30]So I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[05:08.82]I'll be elsewhere.
[05:10.96]I'll make sure you know exactly where that is.
[05:13.10]I have no idea when that is, by the way.
[05:17.56]All I know is that it's going to happen.
[05:21.27]Because the nature of what Kit does.
[05:23.95]If he gets a good call, then maybe he'll want to bring me in.
[05:26.27]If it's like, nah, nah, this one sucks.
[05:27.81]Nah, nah, nah, forget this one.
[05:30.13]But I will be on that stream.
[05:31.51]Just kind of in the wings waiting to do something fun.
[05:37.34]Am I going to use your voices?
[05:39.54]I don't know.
[05:40.62]It depends on whatever he wants to do.
[05:44.34]That's the plan for the remaining couple of days.
[05:47.56]Now, if The Long Drive... If I'm done with The Long Drive in like an hour, I'm just going to move on to that super game.
[05:52.74]Like House Flipper.
[05:53.42]Alright, let me... Hold on.
[05:56.98]Let me... I have to put on pants.
[05:59.42]And this is just... I didn't think the camera was going to be on at all today.
[06:02.39]I have to put on... I have to put pants on.
[06:03.81]I'll be right back.
[07:04.01]It's good.
[07:04.27]We're still on the starting soon screen.
[07:05.91]That's fine.
[07:09.93]Okay, how do I censor this?
[07:18.34]I don't want to show this shit.
[07:19.52]It's disgusting.
[07:20.34]Fucking webcam's not even plugged in.
[07:28.58]There is a monster that sneaks into this room at night and unplugs my webcam.
[07:32.54]It's not me.
[07:34.65]Why is it unplugged?
[07:39.65]What a stupid thing to like to do.
[07:42.74]Why?
[07:43.70]Why unplug my webcam?
[07:44.78]Why not pull the power cord out?
[07:46.50]That's way funnier.
[07:47.28]I don't know.
[07:48.44]I can't turn my computer on.
[07:49.42]There's something wrong with it.
[07:50.30]I'm going to fucking work.
[08:00.63]Who's unplugging my webcam?
[08:06.31]Did you guys hear like a... You did?
[08:16.09]No, you should have.
[08:20.76]Hey, there we go.
[08:21.26]Okay.
[08:23.60]Alright, so.
[08:25.16]Here's the deal.
[08:25.84]I'm going to blur this.
[08:28.62]My hair is a fucking mess.
[08:29.60]Hold on.
[08:33.91]It's delayed too.
[08:35.13]I'll tell you, the trouble I'm going through right now to show you guys a wart on my finger is... It's insane that I'm doing this.
[08:46.27]Okay.
[08:47.13]So.
[08:48.19]Please not have, like, a weird frame here.
[08:50.03]Okay, I'm, like, so scared.
[08:55.31]I, like, don't know if I should do this.
[08:57.43]Okay.
[09:02.60]You see?
[09:07.48]Can you see?
[09:07.98]Okay, so here.
[09:09.40]Clean.
[09:10.14]Clean, normal hands.
[09:12.78]Regular.
[09:13.68]See?
[09:14.76]There's nothing weird there.
[09:15.83]I cannot put my right hand up.
[09:19.69]Okay, should I do it from far away?
[09:21.53]No, I have to blur it.
[09:28.57]This is not how big this was, okay?
[09:30.55]It's after I froze this shit is when it did this.
[09:34.70]So I like put the freezer on there for like 10 seconds or whatever and you take it off and your skin turns like all white.
[09:41.34]And then it like it started inflating.
[09:44.75]It actually started inflating.
[09:46.19]I'm not kidding.
[09:48.57]Okay, if I show you from far away, that's like, that's okay, right?
[09:50.91]This is so embarrassing.
[10:04.02]Do you see?
[10:04.62]It hurts.
[10:10.37]I'm not gonna show it up close.
[10:14.45]It's not alive.
[10:15.35]Alright, I'll show it up close with a sensor tag on it.
[10:17.69]Hold on.
[10:20.03]It's literally nothing.
[10:20.99]No, it is something.
[10:22.23]You don't make me show it up close.
[10:24.77]I will.
[10:27.15]Okay, hold on.
[10:28.03]I need to put a blurring effect on this.
[10:29.58]I need to focus the camera.
[10:32.94]Okay, here we go.
[10:33.28]Ready?
[10:33.42]Ready?
[10:36.51]Alright.
[10:43.84]Okay, so we're completely censored now.
[10:45.85]So, like, it doesn't matter.
[10:46.77]Like, you're not gonna puke.
[10:51.51]See?
[10:51.89]I've been completely censored.
[10:52.87]I could be in a fucking TV commercial.
[10:54.44]I could be in, like, a law show and you would have no idea who I was.
[11:10.75]We need more censoring for this.
[11:12.51]We need more censoring for this.
[11:16.03]We need more censoring.
[11:26.42]See?
[11:29.34]I told you.
[11:30.48]I told you it wasn't good.
[11:33.86]And this shit's right on my gamer finger.
[11:37.52]It's a homunculus.
[11:41.72]No, it's not.
[11:42.94]That's from the freeze.
[11:43.90]It was tiny, but I freaked out because I'm 35 now and I can't have warts on my hands.
[11:47.95]I'm 35.
[11:48.41]I'm not 80-105.
[11:49.55]So it's on my gamer finger.
[12:00.49]Long story short.
[12:03.53]And you ain't ever gonna see me again.
[12:07.66]I'm turning the face cam off.
[12:08.96]I don't want it on.
[12:10.42]This ain't a face cam stream.
[12:11.94]Tempo popping.
[12:15.48]Don't say that.
[12:16.26]Oh, it's disgusting.
[12:17.04]I hate it.
[12:17.38]I don't even like looking at it.
[12:19.35]I'm an incredibly clean person.
[12:21.83]I'm so clean.
[12:22.77]I shower.
[12:23.47]I bathe.
[12:24.95]I do the, I do, I, you know what I mean?
[12:27.33]Like, I bathe.
[12:29.15]I go like this and like that.
[12:35.87]Doesn't bathe.
[12:36.35]Yeah, I go under the armpits too.
[12:38.11]You don't.
[12:39.13]You don't.
[12:41.79]You just put the shampoo conditioner combo can thing that you buy at the grocery store and you pour that on your head and you shake that into a lather and then you let it run all over your body while you smear your hands all over your body and like all over your legs and balls and stuff.
[12:58.37]That's what you do.
[12:59.17]I know it is because that's what I did until I was about 30.
[13:08.55]No, I use a puffy.
[13:09.35]No, you don't.
[13:10.37]You don't use a puffy until you're at least 28.
[13:11.77]It was five years ago.
[13:16.81]Five years is a long time, man.
[13:20.24]That's a long time.
[13:24.14]Every time I click.
[13:27.16]Do I have to go on the streamer disabled list for 15 days?
[13:31.32]Because I can't click the mouse?
[13:40.52]Ah, too bad, the Boston Red Sox have to put Jerma985 down on the disabled list, because he has a big wart on his finger.
[13:47.94]Oh, you, isn't that embarrassing?
[13:51.18]Back to you, John.
[13:56.45]Please, just drain it.
[13:57.37]You're not supposed to, no, the wart specialist that I watched on YouTube said don't drain it when it becomes a boil.
[14:03.09]They said after you do the freeze, it's going to do that and leave it alone.
[14:11.56]Yeah, there's a... Guys, are you that shocked that there's a wart specialist on YouTube?
[14:19.89]There are like witches and warlocks on YouTube.
[14:22.20]You don't think there's a wart guy?
[14:24.76]Alright, here we go.
[14:29.08]This is the long... I don't know what peaceful means.
[14:31.84]I'm assuming there's like monsters or something.
[14:33.39]I don't know.
[14:36.50]I got $50 from Goiki.
[14:37.88]Thanks for the 50, the 5,000 bits.
[14:39.72]And they say, hey, Jeremy, the monkey ball timer ticking down sound haunted me while I tried to sleep after last stream.
[14:46.03]Keep up the good work.
[14:48.17]Get well from the gameritis growth on your gamer finger.
[14:51.35]You know, you have a really great message because it says, hi, Jeremy, the monkey ball timer trickling down sound haunted me while I tried to sleep last night.
[15:01.62]Your stream was haunting me and I felt horrible.
[15:04.26]Keep up the good work.
[15:09.62]Thanks, though.
[15:09.96]That's a lot of money.
[15:10.94]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[15:13.96]Silent Serenity, thanks for five subs.
[15:15.52]And Nuclear Waffle, thanks for five subs.
[15:17.40]Thanks, guys.
[15:19.34]Are we ready?
[15:20.40]I don't even know how to play.
[15:26.54]Wait, this is like a... I thought this was a driving game.
[15:31.57]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[15:34.67]E is open.
[15:36.89]Why do I feel like I'm playing fucking TF2 at like 400 FOV?
[15:43.17]Oh, you actually have to hold it.
[15:44.95]Is there any sound?
[15:48.83]Why is it so low?
[15:49.55]Hold on.
[15:53.39]Seed, alright.
[15:54.11]Okay, there's my fucking personal telephone number.
[15:58.57]Hold on, let's put this up.
[15:59.55]Is it better?
[16:05.23]Okay, I can actually hear now.
[16:06.17]Alright, what does this do?
[16:07.39]Tab is equip.
[16:10.39]Middle mouse button is rotate.
[16:13.51]Oh, shit.
[16:14.67]It's one of these games.
[16:16.98]Move.
[16:18.06]Okay, see, that's how you wash.
[16:21.14]Okay.
[16:22.38]Scroll is move.
[16:23.32]You can move it towards you or forward.
[16:26.26]Right mouse button is rotate.
[16:30.47]Middle mouse and right mouse...
[16:34.05]Well, this is gonna be a fucking joy.
[16:35.63]Wait, you guys can't see anything?
[16:40.92]Why did that happen?
[16:43.12]Okay, so.
[16:44.20]Tab is equipped.
[16:46.44]We got... Mouthwash?
[16:49.16]Left mouse button, mouse wash.
[16:51.80]Oh, cool!
[16:54.94]This is so much fun.
[16:56.84]Okay, cool.
[16:57.26]Wait, cotton candy.
[17:03.15]Alright, so how do I pick this up?
[17:05.38]How do I put this down?
[17:09.40]Oh, F. Pick that up.
[17:12.28]And what the hell is this?
[17:14.28]This is a duster?
[17:15.49]Okay, I don't think that's what that is.
[17:24.95]Eat this?
[17:29.22]Can you?
[17:34.51]Trying to do, like, party tricks.
[17:38.81]Alright, well, what am I supposed to do with this?
[17:42.21]This is a cotton candy.
[17:46.80]Do I need any of this stuff?
[17:48.08]Wait, there's a gas tank.
[17:51.04]It's gonna take a while to get used to these controls.
[17:52.52]Why is there a gun?
[17:54.40]Is it a gun?
[17:54.94]How do I use the gun?
[18:08.26]I gotta clean the barrel.
[18:09.70]It's a little rusty.
[18:10.94]Oh, dude, I'm gonna do the thing that happens to John Wick when he goes, Get the hell out of my way.
[18:20.01]You know what I'm trying to do.
[18:22.91]Hey.
[18:24.39]Seems like you're the one that's in my way.
[18:26.15]Ooh.
[18:34.86]How do I put items down?
[18:38.29]Do I have to shoot with my other hand?
[18:43.37]To me, this is like if you were like a gun novice or something, this thing on my right hand would be like a product that somebody would sell.
[18:50.61]That's just an absolute stupid bullshit product that's supposed to help with suppressing the fire.
[18:55.40]Here's the gun grip.
[18:57.48]Like that would be on like an infomercial that like four o'clock in the morning that no one would buy.
[19:02.76]You sick of the big recoil on your shotgun?
[19:05.46]Not anymore.
[19:05.92]Alright, what the fuck do I do?
[19:09.24]How do I put this down?
[19:10.17]Alright, I gotta look at the controls.
[19:13.07]Mount, pick, mount, dismount, equip, reload, sleep.
[19:18.85]Wait a minute.
[19:35.13]Why is there a piss button?
[19:44.44]Okay, this has turned into a completely different game.
[19:46.94]This turned into a different game.
[19:54.36]This is stupid, okay?
[19:55.80]I'm gonna be honest.
[19:57.87]I still don't even know how to put things down.
[19:59.53]Alright, one.
[20:00.89]Two.
[20:01.77]Okay, so that's...
[20:05.63]I have a gun now.
[20:07.05]How do I fire it?
[20:07.73]What's this?
[20:15.66]Okay.
[20:15.88]Oh, there we go.
[20:16.38]It's just in my inventory.
[20:17.10]Alright, give me the binoculars.
[20:19.34]Good.
[20:19.74]Okay.
[20:20.00]Here's the fly swatter.
[20:21.76]No, fuck that.
[20:22.36]What's the pointless... Ammo!
[20:24.80]Nice.
[20:25.52]Okay, pick up the ammo.
[20:28.78]Okay, let's clean the car.
[20:34.21]Is this doing anything?
[20:38.27]Dismount.
[20:43.38]How do I open the garage?
[20:50.46]It's fantastic.
[20:52.26]Okay, let's... That's bright.
[20:54.06]That's really bright.
[20:54.90]What do I have to do?
[20:55.68]This is a long drive, apparently.
[20:58.56]I'm actually... I want to see what's in here.
[21:09.17]Anything downstairs?
[21:14.36]AH!
[21:21.06]I'm gonna put this in my dashboard thing.
[21:22.36]You know how people have on their rear view mirror?
[21:26.86]Can I put this on there?
[21:27.46]Alright, hold on.
[21:29.61]Open the door.
[21:30.09]Okay, how do I get in?
[21:39.61]Sit.
[21:44.88]Nice!
[21:45.20]Oh, I have to drive.
[21:47.84]Uh, okay, close this door?
[21:52.10]And then we pull out?
[21:53.44]Do I have gas?
[22:02.81]How do I drive?
[22:03.53]There's a crosshair!
[22:16.89]Are they ammo somewhere?
[22:18.05]Alright, how do I turn the car on?
[22:21.65]Oh shit, okay.
[22:27.00]How do you drive?
[22:31.30]Oh boy.
[22:31.80]Okay, okay, okay, alright, alright.
[22:44.56]Okay, let's go.
[22:45.46]And then we just drive.
[22:47.57]What are we driving to?
[22:48.29]Dude, I can't even see!
[22:53.22]I can't see the road!
[22:54.42]Is there a road?
[22:58.58]Oh, okay, but this is the road.
[23:14.77]Okay, is it like this ultra bloom effect or what?
[23:17.75]How far, where do I have to go?
[23:18.81]How do I turn up the super bloom?
[23:34.02]You can't.
[23:34.54]What do you mean I can't?
[23:39.30]Wrong side of the road.
[23:40.82]Ow, my gamer wart!
[23:42.99]That hurts so bad.
[23:45.13]See?
[23:45.43]That's why I told you I couldn't fucking play.
[23:55.37]Well, that would've killed me, I think.
[23:56.49]Alright, slow down.
[23:57.77]I gotta slow down.
[24:03.41]Slice it off.
[24:04.47]Ugh!
[24:10.65]Wait, what am I doing?
[24:11.35]No, don't open the door.
[24:15.21]How do I use this?
[24:19.72]Oh, it's cigarettes.
[24:21.00]It's not ammo, okay.
[24:21.94]How do you throw shit?
[24:26.48]Do I drop?
[24:41.34]Yeah.
[24:42.74]Oh.
[24:42.88]Okay.
[24:45.18]Alright, now I got two hands on the wheel.
[24:46.62]So what's the goal here?
[24:47.42]Do I have like a task?
[24:55.04]It's just to drive.
[24:55.84]Alright, well I'm gonna fucking kill this.
[24:57.80]This game is gonna be done.
[25:00.24]What's the end goal?
[25:01.14]How far do you need to get?
[25:02.18]Turn on the radio.
[25:10.48]I don't think I have a radio.
[25:13.56]It's long.
[25:15.20]Alright.
[25:15.98]Well, I'm alright with that.
[25:16.98]Actually, I prefer this.
[25:17.92]Is that weird?
[25:18.94]Watch out for that fucking rock!
[25:30.65]What's that?
[25:37.92]Oh, did they just keep putting more obstacles?
[25:43.31]You have gas.
[25:47.45]I have like no gas in the tank.
[25:51.27]What do you get gas?
[25:57.03]I'm going 130... 140 miles per hour right now.
[25:59.89]Need to go to a gas station, a gas store.
[26:05.20]Really?
[26:05.52]You have a GPS?
[26:12.64]I see something right there.
[26:14.34]There's a house right there.
[26:20.94]Hit the brakes!
[26:21.40]Hit the brakes!
[26:21.92]Brakes!

[26:31.98]What happened?
[26:35.54]What?
[26:48.33]Did I drink it?
[26:56.71]What did I just do?
[26:58.16]Wait, how did I drink that without taking the cap off?
[27:00.14]How do you throw things?
[27:03.46]Nice.
[27:07.48]Pick up.
[27:07.90]What even is it?
[27:18.98]This is gonna be fucking, this is disgusting.
[27:26.43]Come on!
[27:26.77]It's been three days since I've had anything to drink.
[27:34.97]Okay, that's probably against the rules.
[27:36.17]I probably shouldn't do that.
[27:38.11]Is that gas?
[27:40.43]Ow.
[27:41.72]Oh, shit.
[27:42.22]Okay, here we go.
[27:44.72]Push.
[27:46.64]Ah, that's fun.
[27:50.09]Okay, gas.
[27:52.41]How much is in here?
[27:52.99]I can drink the gasoline.
[27:59.51]Alright, how do I fill up a car?
[28:02.55]Okay, here we go.
[28:03.17]Open this.
[28:05.75]And then gas.
[28:11.44]Nice.
[28:14.70]Is there an easier way to throw?
[28:15.84]Okay, wait.
[28:17.34]Can I suck the gas out of this one?
[28:27.27]Hold on, I can... Can I... Can you actually do that?
[28:41.98]Alright, how do I put this back on?
[28:47.62]Alright, this game just got way cooler.
[28:54.93]Wrong side.
[28:55.53]Okay, I gotta back this thing up.
[29:04.95]I don't know why I do that.
[29:09.00]Okay, that song.
[29:09.94]What is it?
[29:10.90]Milkshake.
[29:11.44]I'm just telling you that's what I hear.
[29:13.22]Okay?
[29:13.34]Okay.
[29:22.90]How do I get the fuck out of the car?
[29:24.76]No, I don't want to take the other door off.
[29:26.32]Get out!
[29:27.63]Out!
[29:28.81]Lean is Q and mouse?
[29:33.27]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[29:34.15]Okay, how do I get the fuck out of here?
[29:38.93]I don't- what?
[29:39.83]I don't want to take the radio out.
[29:41.10]E!
[29:41.92]Okay, let's go.
[29:42.68]What else is in here?
[29:47.56]Extra tires, take them.
[29:50.90]Oh, shit.
[29:51.48]Can I put this in the trunk?
[29:59.48]Okay, put the tire in the trunk.
[30:01.25]You always need to spare.
[30:05.17]What is this?
[30:08.97]Can't see.
[30:09.25]What does it say?
[30:09.71]Car oil.
[30:11.75]Extra virgin car oil.
[30:13.12]Alright, let's put it in there.
[30:13.98]4% oil.
[30:14.32]Diesel.
[30:28.11]Alright, 47% gas, 40% diesel, 30% oil.
[30:30.67]Okay.
[30:34.18]Can you open this?
[30:35.30]Oh, wait.
[30:40.86]Right.
[30:41.76]I didn't- Look, it's a video game, guys.
[30:43.50]I didn't think I could actually open the hood.
[30:44.85]It's getting dark out.
[30:47.85]Put this back on.
[30:48.49]Alright, I gotta go.
[30:49.57]I'm probably just gonna bring, like, creepers and shit.
[30:55.26]Okay, this is scaring the shit out of me.
[30:56.36]Wait, I gotta fill up the gas.
[30:57.38]Fill up the gas.
[30:57.82]Fill up the gas.
[31:01.70]Alright, fill this up.
[31:02.24]Can I fill it up with this?
[31:06.10]Alright, hurry up.
[31:10.40]I need to take one more thing.
[31:11.23]I don't know what that is.
[31:14.97]I don't know what this is.
[31:15.61]I don't know.
[31:16.73]I'm gonna take it with me, though.
[31:18.21]Ow!
[31:19.73]Shit, that fucking hurt.
[31:24.49]Let's go!
[31:30.78]No, don't take that off.
[31:31.88]Get in the car.
[31:34.08]I can't see anything, but... Okay.
[31:48.23]How do I turn my headlights on?
[32:02.04]How do you turn headlights on?
[32:03.90]What's it say?
[32:04.56]What's wrong?
[32:07.48]You broke the car.
[32:10.31]Turn on the headlights.
[32:11.11]I don't know how to turn the headlights on.
[32:12.33]Because you put oil in the gas tank.
[32:18.87]I can't fucking see anything.
[32:26.72]You put three types of fuel in here.
[32:28.58]Fucking whatever.
[32:29.46]Alright, give me this one.
[32:35.81]What?
[32:36.31]Get in here.

[33:42.01]I didn't see a motorcycle.
[33:44.05]What?
[34:05.64]Blood.
[34:06.12]That came out of my mouth.
[34:14.30]Just spit out a bunch of Kool-Aid.
[34:20.16]Can I get a different camera angle?
[34:26.72]Oh, that might have been it.
[34:27.60]That might have been it.
[34:29.64]Longest drive, seven kilometers.
[34:42.83]Doesn't seem very far at all, actually.
[34:44.77]Okay.
[34:46.23]Alright, let's go.
[34:46.93]Continue.
[34:49.80]Wait a minute.
[34:50.16]It gives you checkpoints?
[34:55.10]This is not good, though.
[34:56.06]I just don't have the gas.
[34:57.40]This car has, like, a bunch of fucking different fuel in it.
[35:02.53]Can I do anything about this?
[35:14.18]Alright, what's this?
[35:17.29]Can I bring this with me?
[35:21.89]Oh.
[35:23.75]What's this thing?
[35:26.99]This looks dangerous.
[35:32.21]Oh shit, this is a way better car this time.
[35:34.05]Give me the gun.
[35:36.69]Give me the... Pew pew balls.
[35:40.92]Give me the, uh...
[35:47.32]Give me the oil.
[35:47.84]Might need it.

[35:53.98]Whoa.
[36:03.17]Oh, this is the front of the car.
[36:04.07]No, it's not.
[36:05.01]What kind of trunk is this?
[36:11.52]What?
[36:13.87]It's a front engine, a back engine.
[36:21.57]What the fuck?
[36:23.69]I've never seen a back engine.
[36:25.87]This is freaking me out.
[36:27.17]I've never seen this before in my life.
[36:29.25]In my entire life.
[36:34.25]Oh.
[36:37.85]There's a block of gold.
[36:38.71]This actually is a brick of gold.
[36:40.91]Alright, I need this.
[36:43.71]Okay.
[36:50.82]Holy shit, Jeremy.
[36:53.04]Are you stupid?
[36:53.70]There's like a bunch of gas here.
[37:00.09]Pick it up.
[37:00.91]Pick it up.
[37:15.90]Good, it fits.
[37:16.70]I don't- who cares- what am I gonna be- binoculars for what?
[37:22.45]Oh.
[37:24.67]Airbrush?
[37:25.03]Turn this on.
[37:28.07]Oh, wait!
[37:28.65]That's an emergency light, I need that.
[37:44.08]Oh, get the girlfriend downstairs.
[37:45.74]What girlfriend is downstairs?
[37:50.44]Whatever.
[37:51.48]Wait, can I take... What's in here?
[37:53.57]Is it alcohol?
[37:54.25]This is just all full alcohol.
[37:58.31]I can just make... Can I make... Wait, this is diesel.
[38:00.43]Okay, can I pick this up?
[38:02.43]Okay, we're going to take this.
[38:03.19]I'm going to put this in the back seat.
[38:09.54]You never know.
[38:09.96]I might find a truck and I could use it.
[38:17.06]Alright, this is like, okay, I bought a coffee table one time, and I jacked up the entire inside of the back of my car, because I was like, no, I can get it in there, and I technically could.
[38:28.39]I could technically get it in there, but not, like, safely to not ruin your entire backseat.
[38:38.12]It technically fits in there, but I ripped up a bunch of shit.
[38:40.82]I ripped up the seats.
[38:41.60]I scratched the fucking ceiling.
[38:44.46]Let's see if I can get this in here.
[38:46.22]Oh, yeah, I can.
[38:47.19]Just take the doors off.
[38:47.77]What the fuck am I gonna need these for?
[38:49.85]Who cares?
[38:56.41]Yep, just like the coffee table.
[39:00.68]Okay.
[39:02.50]Wait, I put this back on?
[39:06.07]Alright, yeah, we're good.
[39:08.51]That is exactly what it looked like, by the way.
[39:11.17]Except it wasn't as tall.
[39:12.71]I can still see.
[39:13.29]Okay, uh, I need this emergency light.
[39:19.34]Oh, that's how you throw.
[39:21.24]That's how you throw.
[39:21.96]What's under there?
[39:24.20]That's pretty cool, but I don't- wait.
[39:25.32]Alright, I'm ready.
[39:40.78]It's time to get huge.
[39:43.66]I think I'm ready, right?
[39:48.94]What the fuck was that sound?
[39:50.20]Close the door!

[40:02.00]He's dead?
[40:02.62]What happened to him?
[40:07.18]What is this?
[40:16.72]It's like a giant bunny?
[40:19.70]Get out of there.
[40:26.68]It ran into the wall and died.
[40:30.79]Get out of there.
[40:31.57]I know.
[40:31.81]I'm just scared.
[40:32.29]I'm just... I have to leave!
[40:36.91]I don't know why.
[40:37.25]That just scared me so much.
[40:38.35]Why did that scare me?
[40:39.47]I thought like another one was right there.
[40:40.69]Alright, I'm out.
[40:43.90]Let's go.
[40:51.75]I can't see anything.
[40:53.63]Okay, I'm gonna get this- this is gonna be fun.

[41:32.98]That's why I never drive with music on.
[41:34.40]You're not going to fuck with me.
[41:47.58]No, I don't like driving with music.

[49:09.65]You said it was a bicycle.
[49:10.73]Alright, let's go.
[49:18.47]Here we go.
[49:29.36]This is a bicycle.
[49:30.34]What's the gas for?
[49:45.70]It's for turbo.
[49:46.60]Alright, I have to get on this now.
[49:47.95]I have to leave now.
[49:49.45]I have to get out.
[49:49.91]I have to leave now.
[49:50.41]I'm freaking out.
[49:51.71]Just be... I just got 100% gas.
[49:55.17]Can I put anything on the back?
[49:58.29]Stay upright.
[49:59.22]How do I get it to stand up?
[50:00.44]Where's the kickstand?
[50:09.36]Oh my fucking god.
[50:14.48]Press B. Balance.
[50:18.89]Okay, I have to get on now.

[50:22.14]Just get on.
[50:22.52]Just get on.
[50:22.94]On.
[50:23.12]Why is it doing this?
[50:24.78]Why is it doing this?
[50:58.22]Where are the lights?
[51:01.73]Wrong way?
[51:02.53]I'll get it.
[51:03.13]Okay.
[51:08.73]Okay, I'm going.
[51:12.16]I have the gas.
[51:16.54]Ignition.
[51:20.89]It's a battery.
[51:21.65]You need the battery.
[51:22.75]What?
[51:31.41]Don't run into a rock, don't run into a rock.
[51:33.90]I'm gonna use the headlights from the other car if I find it.
[51:42.74]Okay, that's not even a fart.
[51:46.94]That's like, okay, I get like the funny fart joke thing, but that is like you shit your pants.
[51:50.75]Okay, I need the headlights.
[52:01.08]I don't even... Okay, I thought that was just like a supernova.
[52:09.56]I need the headlight.
[52:11.88]Thank God.
[52:12.58]Alright, let's... I need to be able to look.
[52:18.76]Okay.
[52:20.13]I have a little bit of light here.
[52:21.11]I'm gonna say there's a battery by the gas pump.
[52:32.85]Battery.
[52:36.15]It's green.
[52:36.81]No, this is... This is oil.
[52:48.00]Seriously?
[52:48.42]Okay.
[52:53.45]Just put this fucking thing... Can I fit it in the car?
[52:56.91]Can I fit the... I want to take the bike with me though.
[53:06.62]The engine's in the house.
[53:08.56]Well, then I'm just gonna have to sit and wait!
[53:18.83]What's this?
[53:19.11]Alright, I probably shouldn't be breathing that in.
[53:27.31]Oh, it's a paint!
[53:29.63]It's paint!
[53:32.87]I get it, it's paint.
[53:34.35]Right, okay.
[53:48.74]This is not doing anything.
[53:51.42]Somebody just gave a shitload of subs.
[53:52.96]That's 59 community subs.
[53:56.86]From Red Zed Rider.
[54:01.00]Thanks for the nearly 60 fucking subs, dude.
[54:02.83]That's insane.
[54:05.73]Thank you, Red.
[54:08.95]Holy shit.
[54:09.87]We also had a bunch of donations, too, that came in that were huge.
[54:19.92]What's that?
[54:20.28]Is this it?
[54:23.07]I just can't see anything.
[54:31.95]Oh, shit!
[54:32.73]Like, that doesn't turn the lights on in the house.
[54:37.02]Oh, man.
[54:37.46]We're gonna be fine now.
[54:39.12]Oh, God.
[54:41.50]Is this it?
[54:42.10]I think I found it.
[54:43.80]This is definitely like a bike engine or something.
[54:46.30]Yeah, absolutely.
[54:47.06]What is this?
[54:47.42]A bike engine?
[54:48.93]It's a bike engine.
[55:06.32]Pick it up.

[55:40.27]I got him, I got him, I got him.
[55:41.36]Is that it?
[55:44.90]Okay, I don't hear any more noise.
[55:54.88]Okay, is it weird if I just want to sit here until the sun comes up?
[56:00.29]What if I just don't want to do anything?
[56:04.07]I'm safe in my car.
[56:07.21]It's like lightning, right?
[56:10.22]When you're in your car, if lightning strikes your car, you're going to be fine.
[56:13.90]You're protected in the car.
[56:15.80]I don't know if that was a lie that my parents would tell me because I was terrified when we were driving around there was thunderstorms.
[56:20.00]Is that true?
[56:27.65]It's the safest place of all.
[56:28.77]Yeah.
[56:35.15]Ow.
[56:36.51]Game reward.
[56:40.28]Sleep.
[56:41.78]Oh, I can sleep!
[56:49.18]That thing's huge.
[56:55.71]Nice.
[56:58.43]Red, Zed gave another 50 subs.
[57:00.59]Red, you are a fucking maniac.
[57:02.59]That's 110 community subs.
[57:06.23]Thank you, that's insane.
[57:08.13]That is way too much money.
[57:14.95]Oh, this is shit!
[57:15.75]That's a ton of subs though, thank you dude.
[57:28.18]Okay, so can I put this on?
[57:33.90]Mount!
[57:34.24]Woo!
[57:35.71]Bingo.
[57:37.77]Here we go.
[57:39.15]It's been done.
[57:45.18]Let's do it.
[57:46.72]Get the gas.
[57:53.70]Go.
[57:57.41]There we go.
[58:04.97]Oh, you didn't build the engine.
[58:06.41]What?
[58:08.71]Look at how fast I can go now.
[58:12.85]Needs a battery.
[58:15.62]Okay, I have daylight.
[58:16.66]Let's go.
[58:17.06]Is there a battery in the house?
[58:22.54]I'm gonna prank my friend.
[58:34.97]Oh, dude, did you see what's happening in your front seat?
[58:38.96]Somebody shit on it.
[58:45.15]No, that's not real.
[58:46.19]That's like the plastic poop stuff.
[58:48.19]Like his friend didn't squat down and shit in his front seat.
[58:57.40]Hey, dude, look, there's shit on it.
[58:59.54]Did you just do that?
[59:00.48]Yeah, I did.
[59:06.68]Battery.
[59:07.40]Give me a battery.
[59:09.86]Let me see one.
[59:10.50]Look, I want to take this bike with me.
[59:20.50]I see it.
[59:21.20]No, you don't.
[59:22.47]You do not see it.
[59:23.17]I remember the headlight.
[59:39.33]Okay, let me do what I was gonna do before.
[59:40.59]How much gas does this car have?
[59:42.59]Where's the gas tank?
[59:49.86]Where's the gas tank?
[59:54.48]Is it on the trunk?
[60:02.02]Is it an electric car?
[60:07.31]Fuel tank empty.
[60:08.29]Well, what the hell are you talking about, man?
[60:10.11]That's the weirdest place.
[60:11.51]Alright, let's go.
[60:13.41]Fill it up.
[60:22.82]Fill up the tank.
[60:30.23]This?
[60:31.59]All the gas that was in here?
[60:38.63]What is that?
[60:46.69]Oh!
[60:48.43]Right!
[60:49.23]I- This is perfect!
[60:58.88]3.9 Ruined, ruined, ruined, ruined.
[61:06.22]Water, water, water.
[61:07.04]What the fuck?
[61:07.54]What are you talking about?
[61:09.53]Don't, don't, don't.
[61:10.29]Omega low, please.
[61:11.17]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[61:14.23]It's gas.
[61:22.13]No, it's not.
[61:22.84]It's water.
[61:23.72]Why is there water in here?
[61:32.04]I have a water meter on the right.
[61:45.81]Peak hydration.
[61:46.87]I'm just a running fountain.
[62:06.14]Drinking and peeing at the same time.
[62:11.16]Alright, that was cool.
[62:13.74]Uh... Now what?
[62:18.18]Oh, right.
[62:18.54]Gas.
[62:18.94]This thing's got gas now.
[62:19.93]This thing's... Oh, yeah, right.
[62:24.13]This is missing a tire.
[62:24.93]That car's way better anyways.
[62:26.09]Alright.
[62:26.93]Let's take... Wait.
[62:27.67]Let me get the sponge so I can clean it.
[62:32.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[62:32.83]Close this.
[62:33.17]I want to clean this car.
[62:39.74]Okay, this is the gold bar.
[62:44.92]Okay, never mind.
[62:46.72]It's not the sponge?
[62:47.62]Why did I not take the sponge?
[62:54.25]What a sick asshole would you be if you were doing that?
[62:58.71]Just rubbing gold bar all over your car.
[63:03.05]Are you a leprechaun?
[63:09.32]I want to take that with me too.
[63:11.06]Let's paint it red.
[63:19.38]Oh, I hate it.
[63:19.98]I don't like it.
[63:20.46]I hate it.
[63:20.78]I want another one.
[63:23.02]Look on the roof.
[63:24.04]What?
[63:26.78]What color is this?
[63:27.36]Blue.
[63:30.28]Yep.
[63:44.36]Hilt.
[63:44.76]How do I tilt it?
[63:49.97]This is gonna look sick.
[63:54.17]Stop grabbing it.
[64:02.52]Let it go.
[64:03.10]Why am I magnetic?

[64:18.67]Chat, hey, chat, don't you think it looks good, chat?
[64:38.90]Look, all I care about is taking the pictures from this side.
[64:42.92]It's okay.
[64:43.24]Don't worry, guys.
[64:43.76]It's a Craigslist car.
[64:46.88]I take the pictures from this angle, this angle, this angle, this angle, and this angle.
[64:52.50]You don't see the whole other side of the car.
[64:53.90]There's fucking dense scratches, like smeared shit all over it.
[64:56.86]Doesn't matter.
[65:01.18]Half the car could be missing.
[65:02.10]Alright, this thing's ready to move.
[65:05.02]There's no back seat?
[65:11.31]No backseat!
[65:13.53]Ah, dudes!
[65:15.19]Um... How we gonna take our diesel?
[65:25.66]Start- To start the engine, climb the- To start- What are you doing?

[66:16.95]I gotta take this with me though.
[66:17.73]I want to eventually use this.
[66:19.04]Let's pick this up.
[66:21.40]Let's try to get this somehow in this car.
[66:24.84]Take the battery out of the car?
[66:26.34]The car battery!
[66:28.18]Oh shit.
[66:30.12]Wait, I gotta sleep in my car first.

[66:50.63]Get out of the car, you buffoon.
[66:52.17]What do you mean, get out of the car?
[66:53.25]This is the only place I feel safe.
[67:07.06]Alright, that could have been me in the chair here.
[67:09.29]Like, in real life.
[67:25.92]God.
[67:28.94]Hey, Jeremy.
[67:29.42]Hey, hey.

[67:32.74]Hey, just what's up, man?
[67:33.95]I'm just chilling here.
[67:36.81]Don't come in the car, though.
[67:37.85]Just stand out there for like another five minutes.
[67:39.35]You smoke, right?
[67:39.95]Smoke a cigarette.
[67:47.09]Come on, go to bed.
[67:49.64]Adjust your mirrors?
[67:51.66]What do I need to adjust the mirror for?
[67:57.85]To like, look at me.
[67:58.85]All I can do right now.
[68:18.43]I can't sleep yet.
[68:19.19]Are there other people?
[68:31.62]I'm gonna sleep with the lights on, too.
[68:36.57]The doors are locked, right?
[68:37.75]Anybody can come in here?
[68:52.12]How can I not sleep yet?
[68:53.22]It's pitch black outside.
[69:01.89]Please don't murder your battery.
[69:03.51]Oh shit.
[69:09.29]Oh shit.
[69:21.84]Okay.
[69:27.93]Okay.
[69:35.13]Almost time to sleep.
[69:39.04]I see it.
[69:39.52]What do you see?
[69:41.44]What do I even look like?
[69:50.86]It's fucking coming.
[69:52.00]It's coming.
[69:53.32]I'm in my car.
[69:54.12]I'm safe.
[69:54.66]Nothing can hurt you in your car.
[70:03.30]I got the lights on over here.
[70:04.32]I'm fine.
[70:10.30]Aliens.
[70:20.47]What's that?
[70:20.81]Is that what you're talking about?
[70:21.99]What is that?
[70:31.84]Like a meteor?
[70:43.07]Alright, time to sleep.
[70:56.28]Good.
[70:57.30]Okay.
[71:02.12]That's what I look like.
[71:03.34]Wow.
[71:05.06]That's cool.
[71:06.58]You can actually see a head moving around.
[71:08.24]Alright, what was I doing?
[71:08.91]Battery, right.
[71:19.64]Back engine.
[71:23.63]Wait a minute.
[71:26.13]If I take the whole engine and put it in that car, won't this have full gas?
[71:38.06]Is that a battery?
[71:39.22]What is this?
[71:42.82]Coolant tank.
[71:45.62]Where's the battery?
[71:55.18]Does this guy not have a battery?
[71:56.20]Guys, I don't think batteries are in the game.
[71:59.44]There's no such thing as a battery in the game.
[72:09.19]Bike is already ready.
[72:10.02]Alright, let's just take it with us.
[72:10.98]Can I take the seat out?
[72:26.76]Did I do that?
[72:28.06]Hold on, did I do that?
[72:30.64]In my sleep?
[72:35.70]What the fuck?
[72:40.87]Why?
[72:43.93]Just drive.
[72:48.16]Hold on, I have to close that.
[73:04.54]It's not gonna work.
[73:09.28]Or is it?
[73:10.36]What's wrong with this?
[73:34.83]I didn't put water in here.
[73:36.07]What do you mean water?
[73:40.15]I did not put water in there.
[73:42.75]The thing is the tank is open, hold on.
[73:45.68]Holy shit, there's an animal!
[73:50.82]What?
[74:02.49]I didn't close the gas tank.
[74:05.61]Okay, we're good.
[74:39.86]Why?
[74:40.14]I didn't fill it with water?
[74:42.88]I drank the water.
[74:44.26]Look!
[74:47.94]100% gas, nothing else.
[74:49.78]See?
[74:55.17]What happened?
[74:55.79]I need oil?
[74:56.51]Oh no, what?
[74:58.99]Protect the oil, fuck.
[75:14.74]Alright, where's the oil?
[75:24.28]That's the gas tank.
[75:25.56]This car is freaking me out.
[75:28.25]Where's the actual oil?
[75:30.23]Isn't it underneath?
[75:33.89]You need 3% oil.
[75:34.33]3% oil in the tank.
[75:47.06]Hold on.
[75:49.68]Is it for real?
[75:51.16]Like a lawnmower.
[75:57.04]No, that's a gas.
[75:58.34]I thought this is a gas tank.
[76:00.92]3% oil?
[76:08.72]This didn't do anything!
[76:17.71]That's gas?
[76:18.69]This is gas?
[76:20.91]It says car oil.
[76:27.00]Give me fucking oil.
[76:27.92]Who's got oil?
[76:28.56]Is this oil?
[76:39.15]Oil?
[76:39.35]Huh?
[76:44.39]Huh?
[76:48.20]Where's the indicator?
[76:50.98]Oil.
[76:51.40]Go.
[76:55.96]Alright, 3% oil.
[77:05.49]What's going on?
[77:07.33]I'm not even putting it in the car!
[77:09.48]Is that okay?
[77:17.30]Is that okay?
[77:20.38]Just drive?
[77:33.70]Hold on, I need to close this.
[77:37.37]Alright, we're good!
[77:37.97]Let's go.
[77:40.43]Long drive.
[77:52.12]Nice.
[77:52.46]Alright, I'm on the right track now.
[78:07.68]Wrong way.
[78:19.27]I care more about the mirror than the facecam.
[78:22.19]What do you mean?
[78:23.63]Am I going the wrong way?
[78:24.59]I don't remember what side this was on.
[78:37.90]Guys.
[78:38.20]I... I don't know what the hell's going on.
[78:42.84]This is the right way.
[78:46.22]Hey.
[78:47.22]Thanks, chat.
[78:47.68]Appreciate it.
[78:59.67]Why you needed oil?
[79:01.15]Oh, it's okay.
[79:01.67]We'll get another one.
[79:04.96]This car sucks.
[79:15.90]Hey, guys.
[79:17.84]Don't ever take your eyes off the road.
[79:27.12]Your face came in the mirror.
[79:44.62]No.
[79:45.38]No.
[79:46.14]No.
[79:46.94]No.
[79:49.22]No.
[79:52.70]What's that mean?
[79:54.50]Is the car too hot?
[79:59.50]Why do I have a minigun cooldown meter?

[90:27.39]I have to do this, otherwise they're going to kill me.
[90:29.20]Alright, no, they're running away.
[90:36.78]We're fine.

[91:02.81]I'm good.
[91:03.17]Alright, we're getting back to the road.
[91:06.55]Does a spare tire in the trunk always bring a spare tire?
[91:12.67]I know, exactly.
[91:15.90]Always bring a spare.
[91:17.72]Even if you're going down the street.
[91:18.72]They're behind you in real life.
[91:22.40]Oh.
[91:22.48]There's a dog back there.
[91:29.37]I've made it back to the road.
[91:30.53]Okay.
[91:33.53]Now it's just a question of just be careful here.
[91:35.57]Don't be an idiot.
[91:44.82]Put it in break.
[91:46.38]Get that spare tire.
[91:51.27]Yeah, gold sure is worth a lot right now, isn't it?
[91:55.11]What can I do with gold right now?
[92:01.54]I could be the richest man on all of the Earth.
[92:05.06]If I don't have a spare tire, I'm dead.
[92:19.44]okay let's go now what I just have to make it to a gas station I'll be okay
[92:47.73]I don't even know what happened!
[92:49.39]What happened?!
[92:56.11]What ha- I didn't do anything, I just ran!
[92:57.91]I'm better off just walking!
[93:08.27]Just abandon the car.
[93:10.05]I can't!
[93:10.84]I have to- Alright, at least give me the gold bar.
[93:17.15]Restart Roy.
[93:18.27]No, I'm not restarting yet.
[93:22.72]Not yet.
[93:23.04]I'm not done yet.
[93:25.89]Let's go get
[93:46.07]Where's the fucking road?
[93:47.01]Where's the road?
[93:48.75]What's in the front seat?
[94:02.85]Just restart?
[94:03.62]No, but it's- I'm so close to the gas station, I can feel it.
[94:11.92]Look, I'll just do a Mario Kart skip.
[94:25.66]Alright, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[94:27.38]Fine.
[94:28.22]There's the road.
[94:33.42]The road's right there.
[94:52.45]Oh my god, he's starting to believe this is no I'm not I don't I just want to I just want to get to another gas station Use the save state I don't have save state Doesn't have an engine Pod watchers skip Don't You stay right where you are
[95:21.71]Open the hood.
[95:25.69]If I open the hood, I can go faster?
[95:28.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[95:29.37]If I just take this whole thing apart but leave the wheels on, will I be able to run faster with it?
[95:33.31]Is that for real?
[95:40.08]Like, if I just push a skeleton, will that be okay?
[95:51.13]I'm not going to mess with anything right now.
[95:54.53]No, not messing with anything.
[96:02.11]Just leave the car.
[96:02.87]There'll be another one at the next station.
[96:04.49]Yeah, I'm running.
[96:10.78]Turn the radio on.
[96:14.86]Okay.
[96:16.34]No, don't tell me to do that.
[96:19.62]This is the correct way.
[96:20.54]I'm good.
[96:29.83]It's not even going that slow.
[96:30.92]I'm probably running like 15-20 miles per hour.
[96:44.63]I'm just gonna walk.
[96:48.77]It's too fucked up.
[96:49.81]It's too hard to do that.
[96:51.71]Hey, maybe it'll meet me there.
[96:54.83]What about the gold bar?
[96:56.17]Money is useless in the apocalypse, dude.
[96:58.23]That thing was so cool, too.
[97:05.08]It's alright.
[97:05.48]I have my gun.
[97:08.84]I'm ready for anything.
[97:12.55]I drank a shitload of water.
[97:13.76]I'm fine.
[97:27.31]Get to the homeland.
[97:30.33]There'll probably be one very shortly.
[97:33.59]A long walk.
[97:36.15]Restart?
[97:36.81]Reload?
[97:37.71]I think I'm in too deep right now.
[97:38.99]I don't think I can.
[97:47.13]Alright, if there's not a gas station within the next 60 seconds, I will.
[97:53.62]If there's not a gas station on the horizon in 60 seconds, I will restart.
[97:59.21]Reload the gun, they mean.
[98:02.15]I got it.
[98:17.33]Why did I have to look into the rear view mirror?
[98:22.05]This game is really fun though.
[98:23.21]It's just stupid.
[98:24.37]Okay, hold on.
[98:32.91]Is there a gas station on the horizon?
[98:43.29]Hold on.
[98:44.25]This is gonna load up here in a second.
[98:51.17]I got a hundred and nine.
[98:51.85]Can I, wait, can I sleep on the ground?
[99:01.78]Turn up the draw distance.
[99:03.16]You'll be able to tell.
[99:06.70]Kill for food.
[99:40.45]I'm making it to the gas station.
[99:41.55]Fuck you.
[99:41.83]I don't even care.
[99:57.94]I'll sleep on the goddamn ground for all I care.
[99:59.78]Wait a minute!
[100:01.50]What's that down there?
[100:02.50]Is that a tire?
[100:03.30]Is that the car?
[100:06.06]What is that?
[100:06.44]Is that blood?
[100:13.64]What's that over there?
[100:14.96]What is that?
[100:23.45]Come on, give me a gas station like right now.
[100:28.46]Come on.
[100:32.28]No, alright, fine.
[100:34.02]I know, but that's like the whole point of the game is not to just be like a restart Randy.
[100:48.52]No, I got this.
[100:49.18]I do.
[100:50.04]Okay.
[100:51.08]After the s- Okay, one, two, re- After the fourth streetlight, if there's no gas station on the horizon, I will restart.

[107:53.71]Am I going the right way?
[107:54.37]Am I going the right way?
[107:54.99]I just turned around like five times.
[107:57.21]I don't know.
[107:57.89]Is this the right way?
[107:58.45]I have no idea what's going on.
[108:00.70]I don't know.
[108:01.06]Am I going the right way?
[108:01.66]Alright, I mean it this time.
[108:07.40]I really seriously mean this.

[110:21.94]There's no gas station yet.
[110:26.20]You're almost there, am I?
[110:30.61]It's right there, right there, right there, right there.
[110:32.47]Where?
[110:35.73]Is that it right there?
[110:45.98]Walking bus simulator.
[110:49.52]Walking desert bus.
[110:52.13]Now that would be a real, real game.
[110:55.25]You know how people do like the desert bus thing and you have to do the whole thing?
[110:57.80]Imagine walking this whole thing.
[111:04.08]Desert walk.
[111:04.94]Yeah.
[111:07.62]It just saved a checkpoint.
[111:11.95]Alright, come on man.
[111:13.03]Come on.
[111:13.35]I don't want to restart yet.
[111:14.31]Come on.
[111:14.79]Please.
[111:15.27]Right over here.
[111:16.83]Right when I turn this bank right here, it's going to be right there.
[111:22.57]Drink the oil to go faster.
[111:35.88]Turns out that's a lie.
[111:37.07]That didn't do anything.
[111:42.09]Alright.
[111:45.10]Are there any nutrients in oil?
[111:47.50]Somebody look this up.
[111:49.00]Because isn't oil like dinosaur bones ground up in fossils and stuff in the ground and everything?
[111:55.11]It's like there could be some nutrients in there.
[112:00.17]Oil is just the Earth's blood.
[112:01.35]What do you mean false?
[112:16.37]It's the opposite of that.
[112:18.28]It's like decomposed like soil and... and... and... boogers and stuff and old shit and piss and diarrhea and... bones and... jello.
[112:27.54]All the old jello that they threw away.
[112:29.02]It all turns into oil in the ground after like 600 million years.
[112:45.39]Okay.
[112:46.39]I have to pull the plug on this.
[112:47.19]I gotta restart.
[112:49.55]I can't believe I did it for this long.
[112:50.77]I'm so ashamed that I did it for this long and I didn't see it to the end.
[112:58.39]I'm ashamed.
[113:04.70]You're almost there.
[113:05.64]Get to that rock formation.
[113:07.10]I can't.
[113:07.60]I feel like that rock formation is permanently in the background.
[113:10.72]I did tell you when I hit this bend, if it wasn't right here, that I was done.
[113:13.58]And I was gonna restart.
[113:16.36]Come on.
[113:17.24]Come on, right here.
[113:18.98]What's that?
[113:21.50]Okay, we've got something.
[113:22.92]We got something.
[113:23.42]We got something.
[113:23.80]We got something.
[113:24.20]We have something.
[113:24.62]Something here.
[113:25.16]What's that?
[113:29.25]What is that?
[113:31.67]I see something in the distance.
[113:32.91]I see a tower.
[113:33.93]I see like a... Is that an oil tower?
[113:37.45]There's definitely like a car over there.
[113:39.64]We're good, boys and girls.
[113:44.82]Stare at this until you can't see anymore.
[113:48.13]We're almost there.
[113:50.90]We're so close.
[113:51.72]Okay, I'm happy now.
[113:58.14]But how far away is that actually?
[113:59.54]Get my gun.
[114:05.14]Spawned in.
[114:18.87]Holy shit, why do you have so many hits?
[114:30.48]I might need this.
[114:30.94]I'm going to take this from me.
[114:41.23]Where'd it go?
[114:42.93]Where'd it go?
[114:43.47]There it is.
[114:50.43]I'm going to hold it up to the sun.
[114:51.35]I'm going to cook it with the sun's rays.
[114:54.10]If I hold it here long enough, it'll get like at least like internal temperature of like 140 degrees, right?
[115:12.37]You and me, buddy.
[115:13.23]You and me are best friends now.
[115:14.51]Come with me.
[115:15.69]This is my Wilson now.
[115:17.95]Wilson, do you see what's out there, Wilson?
[115:21.38]It's a bus!
[115:25.03]Can you believe it?
[115:26.69]I can't even believe it, Wilson.
[115:30.15]And you all wanted to restart Randy.
[115:31.59]You're not gonna get it from here.
[115:38.78]He's just my shade.
[115:40.02]He's my sunglasses.
[115:42.18]There's a big bus over here.
[115:47.32]You can do a better Tom Hanks.
[115:49.07]Maybe.
[115:51.32]I'm so happy that there's a huge bus over here.
[115:55.57]Yes.
[115:57.97]This thing is huge.
[116:00.83]Okay.
[116:02.07]So now what?
[116:03.69]Does it need anything?
[116:04.50]Do we have gas?
[116:07.84]How tall am I?
[116:08.70]Okay.
[116:11.70]First of all, let me look up here.
[116:13.96]There's a ladder here.

[116:47.62]It's draining.
[116:48.04]It's draining.
[116:48.40]It's draining right now.

[118:07.21]I don't understand.
[118:07.73]Do I have to do... Can I not get in this?
[118:19.78]Don't even tell me that I walked all this way and I can't get in this fucking bus.

[120:32.15]It's in the back?
[120:37.63]Okay, let's put this down.
[120:38.43]Is there another weird button?
[120:45.19]Side panels on the back?

[120:58.04]Side panel?

[122:07.99]Alright, 3% oil.
[122:10.51]It's 100% oil right now, but that's okay.
[122:14.09]I'm so sad right now.
[122:15.35]I can't believe it.
[122:16.25]There's nothing in there.

[128:21.53]You're right.
[128:24.42]Yeah, that was kind of weird.
[128:25.84]But it was not what I was trying to do.

[128:57.13]There we go.
[129:07.67]Stop.

[129:44.53]How much gas do I have?
[129:48.51]Not a whole lot.
[129:52.38]Look at the fuel indicator.
[129:55.19]Is that full?
[129:56.17]Wait.
[129:56.97]That's left to right.
[129:58.31]Right is empty.

[130:00.41]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[130:03.91]Slow down.
[130:12.71]That's the fuel right there, right?
[130:14.29]Oh, no.
[130:14.75]That's the fuel.
[130:15.29]Okay.

[131:30.43]Come back.
[131:31.37]I just dropped you guys off.
[131:34.28]Good luck.
[131:36.76]I just every 90s comedy movie with you guys.
[131:44.65]I got to walk in the fucking desert for potentially two or three minutes.
[131:49.87]And then somebody is going to pull up.
[131:51.27]It's going to be a bus full of of of like cheerleaders.
[131:56.24]No way.
[132:02.74]Power.
[132:10.78]Where's that tower?
[132:11.38]I'll get that off.
[132:13.46]Alright.
[132:13.72]Where's the tower?
[132:19.25]Let's go.
[132:35.77]Let's go!
[132:36.37]Alright, do you want me to give you my best let's go?
[132:38.55]No.
[132:39.61]That probably hurt.
[132:43.27]Nothing here.
[132:44.17]But there might be a treat at the top of the tower.
[132:50.06]Nope.
[132:51.22]No bus friends for us to be happy about.
[132:54.54]Alright, but there is something up there though.
[132:57.28]Hopefully it's oil or fuel or gas or something.
[132:59.78]Let's go.
[133:00.71]Ow, my eyes.
[133:03.52]Alright, do you want me to- do you want me to like to- to like 14 year old Xbox Live let's go or like 35 year old adult screaming let's go?
[133:11.33]Which one?
[133:11.63]14?
[133:17.90]Okay.
[133:19.88]Yo!
[133:20.48]Let's go!
[133:22.62]Let's go!
[133:23.36]You don't want to wake up anybody in your house, especially like your parents or something?
[133:27.80]If I drop this, is it gonna break?
[133:43.28]Easy.
[133:43.58]Alright, what's in here?
[133:50.65]Gas.
[133:51.81]It's 1.3 liters of gas.
[133:55.23]Hey.
[133:56.31]Go into the gas storage.
[133:57.58]No, don't do that.
[134:03.76]Go on in here.
[134:04.22]I got plenty of gas.
[134:07.68]I'm gonna be the guy that sells it to everybody.
[134:11.32]And then be the guy who gets robbed and killed first because you have all the stuff that everyone wants.
[134:17.44]You can't just pull up like this in an apocalyptic scenario.
[134:20.08]Okay, so that'll be $10 a gallon, please.
[134:23.25]Nope.
[134:24.07]I'll take it all.
[134:27.21]Oh, but my plan.
[134:33.01]Chimpa just gave another 20 subs.
[134:34.26]Chimpa, that's 60 on the day.
[134:38.22]Holy shit, dude.
[134:43.99]That's a fucking ton of money.
[134:45.17]Alright, which way is the right way?
[134:47.03]I don't remember.
[134:47.45]I think it's this left, right?
[134:52.58]Yeah, it's like if you're the guy with like 500 cans of Campbell's soup, 500 people are going to show up to your house.
[135:04.56]Uh, give me one of those.
[135:07.87]No.
[135:08.57]Okay.
[135:09.23]I'll be back with 100 people to take them.
[135:12.05]Oh.
[135:27.44]I had a minute.
[135:28.02]I know I could do it in time.
[135:32.95]No one likes Campbell's soup.
[135:34.37]You don't have to like Campbell's soup.
[135:38.07]You're gonna eat it.
[135:39.77]In an apocalyptic scenario.
[135:41.23]What you... I'm sorry, but if you don't... Oh, I don't enjoy Campbell's.
[135:44.79]I guess I'll die of starvation.
[135:47.91]What was in the road?
[135:48.67]What was in the road?
[135:49.95]What was in the road?
[135:51.31]What was in the road?
[135:52.99]What was possibly in the road?
[135:54.87]Oh, like a fucking trash bag.
[135:56.37]Like a sleeping bag was in the road.
[135:57.75]Okay, cool.
[136:00.99]I lost a mirror.
[136:06.94]I'm good.
[136:09.20]Can I put this back on?
[136:09.82]Okay.
[136:30.01]There we go.
[136:30.29]We're fine.
[136:31.74]Everything's fine.
[136:32.42]Everything's fine.
[136:32.90]Everything's fine.
[136:40.10]Uh, what happened to the... Why can I see through into my car's skeleton right now?
[136:54.38]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[136:59.49]I can do it all.
[137:00.03]I can do it all day.
[137:09.76]Right, right, right.
[137:12.32]What?
[137:14.08]What's right?
[137:18.28]There's a boat?
[137:27.63]Is that a boat?
[137:28.19]Is that what you're talking about?
[137:30.79]What do you mean boat?
[137:32.27]Left.
[137:38.29]Oh my god.
[137:38.77]Holy shit.
[137:39.27]It's actually just like made out of like paper.
[137:41.29]It's a plant.
[137:41.97]I'm okay.
[137:42.39]I'm fine.
[137:42.77]It's not like I was gonna go through the windshield from hitting a cactus.
[137:47.87]I don't know why I thought that was like a cinder blocker.
[137:58.63]Why is there a boat over here?
[138:00.01]That's weird.
[138:03.05]It's a battleship.
[138:04.13]Yeah, that makes no sense.
[138:05.95]Let's investigate.
[138:16.58]I didn't do it.
[138:21.94]Can I actually do their?
[138:25.36]Is it like secrets in here?
[138:32.69]Let's just live here?
[138:33.59]We could, I guess.
[138:41.34]There's a little place you can go in.
[138:42.56]Alright, let me go get my gun.
[138:46.50]There's probably a monster- Holy shit, look at all that fuel in here.
[138:49.68]I need to- Do I have room for that?
[139:05.34]I'm going in.
[139:14.12]Pick up.
[139:14.42]What is it, though?
[139:17.50]What's in here?
[139:17.94]I can drink it, but what is it, though?
[139:26.23]Empty.
[139:29.17]This is oil.
[139:29.79]Shit.
[139:33.03]I might need to take some of these.
[139:35.15]Can I like siphon some of this?
[139:36.23]Can I just dump it in the back of this seat and shit?
[139:38.45]Can I take any of this?
[139:41.57]That's a lot of oil.
[139:42.43]Okay, hold on.
[139:43.58]What's in this one?
[139:45.34]Gas.
[139:46.48]This is 57 liters of gas.
[139:48.56]I have to take this.
[139:51.42]I need to take all of these somehow.
[139:57.31]Let's fill this.
[139:58.03]Okay, we're going to fill this car up completely.
[139:59.43]We're going to fill the whole tank.
[140:05.55]Alright, let's take it in.
[140:06.25]Okay, this is gas, right?
[140:07.57]Alright, let's go.
[140:14.24]Fill up all your other containers.
[140:15.86]Holy shit, I think we just hit the jackpot.
[140:40.84]Can he get in?
[140:42.94]You're in the car on the drive.
[140:44.08]Just run him over.
[140:44.58]Run, run, run, run, run.
[140:52.81]Okay.
[141:02.25]I'm going to bed.
[141:11.97]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[141:12.67]I left the lights on all night.
[141:14.37]Is that bad?
[141:14.81]I left the lights on the whole night.
[141:17.89]That's not gonna be bad, right?
[141:18.69]Alright, pray that it's not a problem.
[141:27.30]Thank God.
[141:28.16]Okay, turn it off.
[141:38.56]This is heavy.
[141:39.58]How am I even picking this up by myself?
[141:40.82]Can I just dump it in there?
[141:43.30]We're gonna have so much gas and so much oil.
[141:45.32]I'm gonna be rich.
[141:46.34]Alright, here we go.
[141:55.79]I want this in here.
[141:59.97]We were out of gas.
[142:01.11]I didn't even know that.
[142:10.31]Fill this whole thing.
[142:18.65]As long as I don't run anything over, this car could probably take me pretty far.
[142:27.58]Sure, this is an original shit car, but I could take the doors off other cars and repaint it.
[142:33.64]Don't forget the oil.
[142:34.56]How much oil do I need?
[142:35.60]3% oil, right?
[142:37.46]Okay, 1% of 40 is 4.
[142:38.04]4, 8, 12.
[142:40.87]Hold on.
[142:41.19]No, wait.
[142:47.61]1% of 40.
[142:48.13]Okay.
[142:48.33]So now what?
[142:52.20]That oil over here.
[142:58.78]It's the one, right?
[142:59.37]Yep.
[143:05.02]No, no, no, stop.
[143:06.32]This is not a two.
[143:09.62]I don't know what that even is supposed to mean.
[143:11.22]What do you mean this is not a two?
[143:12.35]Guys, I just go to the gas station, put the thing in, and just hold it down.
[143:16.05]I don't even know what's in there.
[143:17.25]It's just, this is, this makes your car move.
[143:24.29]I don't know anything else about it.
[143:25.35]Suggest gas.
[143:33.05]It's not a two-stroke engine.
[143:34.47]Do not put oil in the fuel tank.
[143:35.97]Okay.
[143:49.54]Saved.
[143:50.04]This is a lot of gas, too.
[143:55.29]This is great.
[143:58.57]And there's still more in here.
[144:01.74]Oh.
[144:02.66]You ever seen a full tank before?
[144:03.94]Close that up.
[144:05.22]Okay, what about in here?
[144:08.34]So this is... What's in there?
[144:13.27]Is this water?
[144:20.25]This is water.
[144:20.95]Alright, fuck this.
[144:21.63]Just drink it.
[144:38.25]How much is left in here?
[144:39.80]3.3.
[144:40.44]Stop, stop, stop.
[144:41.22]You need water.
[144:42.38]Oh.
[144:42.50]Okay.
[144:44.36]Get out of here.
[145:01.43]Okay, put this away.
[145:06.45]Fill this up at least.
[145:07.19]This is... Alright, here we go.
[145:09.37]This is gas.
[145:09.81]Let's fill the gas up.
[145:12.25]Open the hood for the oil.
[145:13.23]Yeah, I will.
[145:15.47]Let's fill this up.
[145:17.29]How much is left in here?
[145:20.02]Oh, plenty.
[145:20.48]Okay, let's go.
[145:20.98]Ready?
[145:40.26]Mix water and gas to make a potion.
[145:43.82]Stop.
[145:44.02]What do you mean stop?
[145:46.06]I'm filling this gas tank up.
[145:47.18]What do you mean waste?
[145:48.01]What are you talking about?
[145:48.69]I got it.
[145:49.09]I'm good.
[145:50.39]I'm not missed.
[145:50.97]What are you talking about?
[145:51.63]Alright.
[145:57.79]Now it's spilled.
[145:58.53]Now you spilled it.
[145:59.53]Now you spilled it.
[146:00.23]Thanks a lot, chat.
[146:00.95]Now you spilled it.
[146:09.93]And then we're going to put the oil in the front and then we're going to load up and get the hell out of here.
[146:26.24]I'm sorry.
[146:26.64]I'm sorry.
[146:27.00]I'm sorry.
[146:30.66]You're not drinking water.
[146:31.38]You're drinking coolant.
[146:32.24]Alright.
[146:35.80]That's good.
[146:37.02]That's filled up.
[146:41.31]They tell me don't... I need the water for something eventually.
[146:44.54]Alright.
[146:44.86]Well, this is gonna be fun.
[146:46.82]Let's just do this.
[146:57.35]I almost just died.
[146:58.37]I was trying to do skeet shooting.
[147:21.60]It doesn't even do anything.
[147:22.70]Okay, oil.
[147:31.67]Okay, build it up.
[147:42.08]I don't know, dude.
[147:52.49]Okay, that's 100%.
[147:52.91]Coolant.
[147:53.07]Oh, shit!
[147:53.23]Okay.
[147:53.33]We got... 100% full.
[148:21.85]Get out of the way.
[148:22.34]I can't see this.
[148:27.20]Don't you dare.
[148:29.08]Don't, please.
[148:30.02]Okay, everything's full.
[148:30.77]Close it.
[148:34.11]I'm taking this.
[148:34.73]Oh, fuck.
[148:39.00]No, there's still plenty of water in there.
[148:40.30]Let's get a couple of sips.
[148:47.13]Alright.
[148:47.85]Okay.
[148:48.81]Alright.
[148:49.83]We're good.
[148:51.09]It's time to continue.
[148:52.05]But wait!
[148:52.89]I'm gonna bring a barrel of this with me.
[148:56.23]Find a water barrel.
[149:02.67]Alcohol?
[149:15.19]What do I need that for?
[149:17.85]Do I need alcohol for something?
[149:23.83]Water.
[149:25.23]Alcohol.
[149:27.90]Empty.
[149:28.42]Look at the water.
[149:29.06]I just want to fill my water tank.
[149:32.08]Gas.
[149:33.56]Water.
[149:35.12]Oil.
[149:37.00]Gas.
[149:39.73]I probably can take one.
[149:40.53]I can take one of these with me.
[149:41.87]I'm going to take one of the gasolines with me, at least.
[149:46.70]Oh, come on.
[149:48.83]Come on.
[149:51.57]Come on.
[149:54.25]Take a keg with you.
[149:55.95]No, I'm not taking one of these kegs.
[149:57.45]I'm going to take one of the ones with gas.
[150:07.62]That's gas and oil.
[150:09.04]Okay, that's a weird combo thing.
[150:13.22]I'm not sure any of these can even be water.
[150:17.86]I think it's just either gas, oil, or alcohol.
[150:25.39]What the hell is this?
[150:28.51]What is that?
[150:29.75]Oh, it's a cactus.
[150:31.65]Yeah, gas and oil.
[150:33.03]Alright, I'm just taking one of the gases.
[150:35.25]I'm just taking one of the big gas ones.
[150:39.72]There's one line here somewhere.
[150:40.72]It was just all gas.
[150:41.84]This one here?
[150:43.08]Nope.
[150:44.45]this one here.
[150:45.57]Nope.
[150:48.07]Take the alcohol.
[150:53.29]Do I need the alcohol?
[150:54.87]Do I?
[150:55.13]Alright, well this says 35.
[150:57.67]This is the most so far.
[151:05.10]I'm taking the gas.
[151:08.56]I'm taking the gas.
[151:09.24]It's more important to me.
[151:12.38]Alcohol.
[151:12.80]Take the alcohol.
[151:30.97]Mix the alcohol and the gas.
[151:33.95]I can probably fit them both.
[151:37.86]I can probably fit them both.
[151:42.44]I just drank it.
[151:43.48]Shit.
[151:53.15]Don't let them alcohol light you.
[151:57.99]You're right.
[151:58.97]I'm not even sure I can take any.
[152:03.55]I don't think I can even take any guys.
[152:05.21]It's not gonna fit.
[152:09.64]I'll try.
[152:09.94]Try the back seat.
[152:12.24]I'll try.
[152:12.62]This one here has what?
[152:13.86]Where is it?
[152:14.16]Right here?
[152:16.58]Alright, this one.
[152:17.04]Let's go.
[152:17.26]Put it on the roof?
[152:25.01]You're gonna physics the fuck out of the car.
[152:26.55]Yeah, that's a bad idea.
[152:29.01]Can I mount it to something?
[152:34.84]That's not gonna- I don't think that's gonna work.
[152:37.94]Save the game.
[152:38.54]Okay, uh, save?
[152:44.42]Can I take the seats out?
[152:53.38]Alright, let's get- Slow down, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, please, please, please, please, please.
[152:59.96]Okay, take the door off.
[153:08.91]I thought that was going to kill me.
[153:09.95]I was about to be so annoyed.
[153:11.61]Alright.
[153:12.13]Okay.
[153:12.61]Wait, wait, wait.
[153:13.13]We can actually do this now.
[153:14.93]We just need to move some things around.
[153:16.57]The spare tire is going to have to leave.
[153:22.62]Sorry.
[153:22.82]It's useless.
[153:29.30]Okay.
[153:29.96]What is in here?
[153:34.88]This is water.
[153:37.98]Gas.
[153:40.70]And is that oil?
[153:41.56]I'd really like to pick that up.
[153:54.31]Why can I not pick this up?
[153:58.99]Pick up the oil.
[154:19.09]Yes!
[154:20.73]We might be able to get another one in here.
[154:30.54]Alright, so what should I take?
[154:31.50]The owl?
[154:31.78]What should I take?
[154:35.98]Like, pack it for a trip.
[154:37.56]Hold on.
[154:45.46]These are all sealed up, right?
[154:46.60]Yeah.
[154:58.97]Take the tire.
[155:02.17]Let me put it back together again.
[155:14.35]Why is that?
[155:15.23]What are the... We have lots of advice friends.
[155:20.92]It's okay.
[155:21.88]It's good.
[155:23.18]No, I can't take the tire.
[155:24.02]I'm not going to be able to fit in that.
[155:24.96]Wait.
[155:25.26]I can take the front seat out.
[155:27.32]Wait.
[155:27.76]Can I just take out both seats?
[155:35.44]I can't.
[155:40.27]No, I can't take the seats out.
[155:41.29]Alright.
[155:41.73]I think I can still fit it.
[155:44.25]So do I take the alcohol?
[155:53.65]Yes.
[155:54.11]Okay.
[156:05.70]Give me the door.

[163:34.86]Alright, what was I doing?
[163:37.99]Do I use a random number generator to choose games?
[163:46.26]Alright, that motherfucker right there just almost turned on Ratatouille for the Xbox 360.
[163:51.67]I was about to press the button.
[163:54.41]It was one second away.
[163:59.05]I'm going to press it, I think.
[164:01.08]I'm going to hold off.
[164:01.72]Don't do it.
[164:04.42]Okay, car tire.
[164:08.14]Bounce.
[164:10.97]You know what?
[164:11.31]I'll just do this in the morning.
[164:13.19]When I can see.
[164:14.65]Eh, just go to the fucking bed.
[164:15.71]I'll do it in the morning.
[164:19.19]Oh, cat!
[164:19.83]There's an alien cat.
[164:20.93]Oh boy!
[164:21.37]Oh boy!
[164:22.25]Oh boy!
[164:23.07]Oh, there's an alien cat!
[164:24.57]I don't know where he is.
[164:26.49]I don't know why I'm talking like this.
[164:30.84]What?
[164:31.00]Is the door open?
[164:33.38]How many doors are open?
[164:39.33]Okay, if I don't move, he won't see me.
[164:41.11]Am I gonna die?
[164:54.24]I'm alive.
[165:02.31]Okay, all the doors were open.
[165:04.29]Well, that's great.
[165:10.59]Let's continue what I was trying to do before.
[165:15.49]Why can't this go on?
[165:18.54]Oh.
[165:19.26]Well.
[165:20.26]That's why.
[165:21.94]It was dark.
[165:22.90]Give me a break.
[165:24.18]You try to do that shit in the dark.
[165:25.42]Ain't gonna happen.
[165:31.08]Good.
[165:32.10]Good.
[165:34.30]Should I take the chocolate?
[165:36.39]No.
[165:37.33]It's too much.
[165:44.50]We're good.
[165:45.64]We're completely loaded up.
[165:46.76]I got gas.
[165:47.86]I got alcohol.
[165:50.24]Bring Wilson.
[165:56.20]Wilson left.
[166:00.33]Alright, is everybody ready?
[166:08.11]Woohoo!
[166:09.67]Back to the road, boys and girls.
[166:11.21]Let's go.
[166:14.66]Full tank of gas.
[166:21.20]Thank you.
[166:21.64]I- Hoover's texting me.
[166:22.84]I can't talk to you.
[166:26.86]Oh.
[166:29.56]We gotta get back on the road, which is this way.
[166:31.50]I don't like that view.
[166:46.22]This is fine.
[166:47.28]No.
[166:48.97]This is kind of how I sit in the car.
[166:50.93]Like, right here.
[166:51.57]Alright, that's good.
[166:54.71]Left, idiot.
[166:55.47]I'm adjusting my shit.
[167:07.48]No, that's one guy.
[167:09.32]Ban that guy.
[167:10.00]Alright, ban that person.
[167:11.74]Actually ban them.
[167:14.59]When you start, there has to be consequences for one guy fuckery.
[167:24.35]And then unban him.
[167:25.98]And give him a $60,000 a year salary.
[167:28.04]And then fire him.
[167:35.46]And then invite him to your birthday party.
[167:38.30]And then don't show up.
[167:51.46]Yeah, a $60,000 a year salary working 12 seconds?
[167:54.50]Alright, what's the math there?
[167:57.81]Is it like... 12 cents?
[168:01.57]Where am I going?
[168:10.86]Where's the road?
[168:15.22]Go back to the ship.
[168:16.28]No!
[168:17.02]I need to go back to the road.
[168:18.22]I'm gonna be lost.
[168:19.40]I need a GPS.
[168:20.98]I need like a compass or something.
[168:23.12]Stop doing that!
[168:25.72]It has to get out of my way.
[168:27.36]I'll keep doing it.
[168:27.90]Let's find the lamp posts.
[168:39.98]Wrong fucking way.
[168:41.69]Rip.
[168:42.59]Rip it off?
[168:44.37]Good idea.
[168:48.69]Now there's no distraction.
[168:49.85]Where's the ship?
[168:58.07]Alright, yeah, I gotta find the ship because the ship is gonna give me a good indicator of where I am.
[169:02.13]Okay, so it's this way.
[169:06.34]I don't know.
[169:06.68]Turn on the radio for fuck's sake.
[169:18.99]There's nothing on here.
[169:21.37]Jesus.
[169:21.77]I got plenty of gas to find the road, okay?
[169:37.96]Your car sucks.
[169:39.78]Oh yeah?
[169:41.12]Look at all the materials I have.
[169:42.28]Turn fucking right.
[169:50.01]Where's the road?
[169:51.24]Oh, smooth as silk.
[170:04.66]Right, right, right, right.
[170:14.13]Oh, I see it.
[170:14.93]OK, we're good.
[170:15.59]I see the road.
[170:35.55]I'm driving into the sun!
[170:44.75]That's the road right there, right?
[170:46.01]With all those... lamps and all those... things?
[170:48.73]Am I leaving the map?
[170:55.34]No, I'm... There we are, right there.
[170:56.80]That deserves one coffee sip.
[171:07.81]Find somebody that can fucking do what I just did.
[171:09.27]I- You never will.
[171:11.23]I'm the only one that could've just done that.
[171:12.75]Only person on Earth.
[171:15.75]Talk about my reaction time behind the wheel.
[171:27.00]Alright.
[171:27.52]So, is it left or right?
[171:30.49]The correct road.
[171:33.57]Which way?
[171:34.35]Left or right?
[171:39.47]I have no idea.
[171:44.43]Right, MLG.
[171:45.49]Right, MLG.
[171:46.49]Is it?
[171:46.75]50-50.
[171:49.64]Yeah, I'm getting kind of a lot of answers here that I don't know.
[171:58.78]Left, then right, then mod him, then ban him.
[172:10.72]Oh, alright.
[172:11.16]Yeah, there's the boat.
[172:24.15]Keep the poles on the right.
[172:25.59]That's how you know you're going the right way.
[172:27.51]I don't know how fast I'm going.
[172:31.63]I don't have a speedometer anymore.
[172:35.21]Tiny Little Rock in the road almost just ruined everything.
[172:37.69]Slow down.
[172:38.37]No reason to go that fast.
[172:46.94]Go faster.
[172:47.66]The faster I go, the faster this run ends.
[172:57.15]Okay, one kilometer in American, like, toddler speak is what?
[173:03.02]Two, three miles?
[173:04.22]Two miles?
[173:04.64]2.2 miles for one kilometer.
[173:10.76]Oh, that's pounds to metric tons or something.
[173:14.86]What is it?
[173:15.12]Pounds to... What is 2.2?
[173:17.77]1 kilogram is 1 pound.
[173:19.49]Slow down!
[173:23.69]Ooh!
[173:24.37]Pog car!
[173:25.31]Pog car!
[173:28.23]Wait, there's no... I don't have a mirror.
[173:47.53]Alright, let's go back here.
[173:48.49]What is over here?
[173:52.93]Oh, get out.
[173:53.35]What am I getting back in for?
[173:55.74]Don't turn that back on, stupid.
[173:57.36]Alright, we have a yellow car.
[174:01.74]It looks like it could be a little faster.
[174:03.16]We also have a...
[174:10.85]What is in here?
[174:12.03]Okay, this is disgusting.
[174:14.55]But I'm gonna take the gold bar.
[174:15.75]Like, this is just... This is gross.
[174:17.35]This is disgusting.
[174:19.52]How would you miss that much?
[174:20.58]Like, I don't know.
[174:21.50]Are you, like... Are you sitting up here?
[174:25.12]And then... I don't understand how you do that.
[174:28.40]Take the gold bar, though, for sure.
[174:29.52]Alright, well, what do we got in this car?
[174:33.43]Good trunk space.
[174:34.25]Okay, like it.
[174:34.89]Take the gold.
[174:36.71]Okay, what else we got?
[174:43.10]Ooh, look at this leather interior.
[174:44.70]We're going to change the doors out.
[174:48.86]Ooh, nice leather seats.
[174:51.18]This thing is shiny.
[174:51.98]What do we got under the hood?
[174:58.04]V6?
[174:59.68]With an injector?
[175:00.98]With a piston injection?
[175:02.93]Really, really cool, actually.
[175:09.26]Alright, let's fill this up.
[175:11.00]Definitely a better car.
[175:11.96]Wait, what's inside of the weird, scary, cement world?
[175:19.90]Ooh, a new door.
[175:23.72]This is a blue door.
[175:25.62]Who cares, though?
[175:30.42]What is this?
[175:30.76]Ooh, a new hood.
[175:35.12]Put it on.
[175:36.77]I can, but hold on.
[175:43.55]Okay, turn the lights on.
[175:44.77]Don't turn them off.
[175:45.39]That hurts.
[175:49.03]Use the new car.
[175:49.77]I'm gonna.
[175:50.33]What do you mean, idiot?
[175:52.17]I'm gonna use the new car.
[175:53.95]I want to make it look nice.
[175:56.83]What's in here?
[175:58.89]Alright.
[176:00.53]I don't get out of bed for more than three liters.
[176:02.38]You know what I'm saying?
[176:06.38]I couldn't be cool about it.
[176:07.22]Let's just fucking waste it.
[176:13.78]I might need this.
[176:15.02]It's an emergency light.
[176:25.98]How many times have you seen me go, Whoa, I can't see anything.
[176:27.94]Alright.
[176:30.10]What's in here?
[176:31.39]Ooh, shit.
[176:38.47]What's that?
[176:40.35]No.
[176:41.85]What's this?
[176:46.21]No.
[176:46.78]Any dashboards in here?
[177:02.81]Ha ha ha ha!
[177:10.75]It was so far away!
[177:13.02]Why?
[177:13.44]I'm just such a fucking idiot.
[177:15.50]It was so far away, how big is that explosion?
[177:22.53]Wow, I thought it was gonna be so much smaller than that.
[177:26.13]Was it worth it?
[177:26.93]No.
[177:27.79]When was the last auto-save?
[177:29.89]Oh, thank God.
[177:31.56]Thank God the game is an understanding.
[177:37.50]Holy shit, that was awful.
[177:39.58]I'm so... Every emotion just happened.
[177:43.36]What's this?
[177:51.42]What's on her mind?
[177:52.61]Free poster inside.
[177:53.93]Oh, it's a poster.
[177:57.47]1987, interview with the new rock star.
[178:02.69]Yeah, I'll store it up there.
[178:14.97]Just get me away from it.
[178:15.69]I don't want it.
[178:16.21]Okay, let's do some work here.
[178:18.31]Where's the other car?
[178:23.15]Let's bring this over here.
[178:27.24]Use the old car?
[178:28.18]Back on the roof.
[178:33.90]Wait, what is on the roof?
[178:34.56]What is that?
[178:43.64]What's that?
[178:51.84]Wrong fucking way.
[178:53.10]What?
[178:57.30]What did I do?
[178:57.98]Where?
[178:58.24]How did I?
[179:00.98]The bed.
[179:01.56]Did I bring the bed?
[179:11.43]Oil.
[179:14.09]You know what I'm saying.
[179:14.75]I don't even fucking get out of bed for more than... Fuck.
[179:18.56]Whatever.
[179:18.82]What is this?
[179:26.37]Rockboard?
[179:28.05]Easel?
[179:28.33]Alright, nothing up here.
[179:39.05]We gotta hurry this up, though.
[179:42.37]I need to fill the oil tank.
[179:44.39]I got oil.
[179:45.79]I got oil in this thing.
[179:46.91]How do I smoke one of these cigarettes?
[179:52.43]Can you?
[179:53.43]What's the point of having this?
[179:58.66]Use stave with the old car?
[179:59.98]What do you mean use the old car?
[180:02.38]This thing sucks.
[180:08.57]This thing is going to be faster and more efficient.
[180:11.31]It has more storage.
[180:12.27]Yeah, but look at this.
[180:18.66]That's stupid.
[180:20.04]It's stupid.
[180:20.80]It's not cool.
[180:23.48]I can fit some of the gas tanks in here.
[180:25.14]I'm gonna dump this whole thing.
[180:27.10]This is gas, right?

[185:30.16]I want that person timed out for at least five minutes.
[185:40.61]There we go, okay.
[185:42.97]It's a Two-Face car.
[185:46.67]Alright, what do you mean, like, Batman, Tommy Lee Jones?
[185:51.11]Or do you mean Barbie Dent from The Dark Knight?
[185:54.84]Which one?
[185:57.28]Probably that one.
[185:57.96]Probably the Tommy Lee Jones one.
[186:08.99]Take the new engine.
[186:10.35]Oh!
[186:29.86]Holy shit.
[186:34.26]Why?
[186:36.68]Okay.
[186:38.56]It's gas.
[186:39.12]Oh, it's oil.
[186:40.61]Never mind.
[186:40.93]Alright, let's go.
[186:43.13]I got everything I needed from here.
[186:44.99]Three doors.
[186:50.63]Wait.
[186:52.65]Give me that fucking thing.
[186:53.31]I might find oil later.
[187:05.16]Like the gold too?
[187:05.90]Yeah, I will.
[187:26.71]This is heavy.
[187:27.27]Okay.
[187:30.71]Wait, what about...
[187:58.34]Sick!
[187:59.14]Okay, what about, yeah, these are all corroded and shitty.
[188:10.70]Tires, it doesn't matter what tire is what, right?
[188:16.24]It's just, as long as the tire exists.
[188:28.51]This one's ugly.
[188:29.47]Alright, this one looks pretty good.
[188:36.12]Alright, which one's in worse shape?
[188:37.51]Oh, definitely front tire right.
[188:39.63]You know what I mean?
[188:41.49]Front tire right looks like shit.
[188:57.49]I'm getting -2 for that.
[188:59.19]Alright, take the dashboard.
[189:00.25]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[189:01.47]And steering wheel.
[189:02.59]And everything else.
[189:05.29]Take the speedometer.
[189:08.39]This doesn't even fit in my car.
[189:09.83]Alright, what if I just leave it here?
[189:14.78]Will it still work?
[189:21.07]Just hold it.
[189:24.05]No, I can't just hold the fucking thing.
[189:27.41]Hold it in your hand.
[189:32.54]Alright, here we go.
[189:40.20]Does it work?
[189:48.33]No, it don't work.
[189:50.60]It looks kind of cool over there.
[189:51.48]Alright, let's move.
[189:55.30]What about the radio?
[189:56.12]I don't want... Who cares?
[189:57.12]I don't want... Don't move.
[190:02.70]Did this car just stall out?
[190:11.49]I can't take the steering wheel.
[190:20.09]I can't take the steering wheel.
[190:21.15]Can I?
[190:31.20]Rear view mirror.
[190:31.90]Oh shit, nice.
[191:07.89]Okay, it looks good.
[191:13.99]Get this fucking thing out of here.
[191:25.26]Alright, I need to get back on the road.
[191:28.50]Radio?
[191:28.92]Alright, it was this way.
[191:35.25]I forgot about the bed.
[191:36.19]I can't put the bed anywhere.
[191:41.75]Was it this way?
[191:42.33]No, it was the other way, wasn't it?
[191:43.25]No, wait.
[191:44.35]Wrong way, yeah.
[191:52.31]Hole's on the right.
[191:52.91]Right, right, right, right, right.
[191:59.91]Alright, I'll try.
[192:00.53]I'm going to put the bed on the roof.
[192:02.01]Let's try.
[192:04.01]Fuck.
[192:06.21]It's too involved.
[192:19.54]Don't turn it on.
[192:20.14]Alright, where's the bed?
[192:23.28]Save.
[192:25.60]Um, I don't know.
[192:26.20]Wherever.
[192:26.52]Save right here.
[192:29.80]Why does that- Why do I have a negative seed?
[192:44.54]You're infertile.
[192:49.78]Can I actually put this on the car?
[192:51.50]I mean people do this shit, but I don't have any bungees.
[192:55.84]I think it worked.
[193:14.57]Yeah, I'll just... This is Snoopy's house.
[193:18.26]When I get tired, I'm gonna get out of the car, climb up here, lie on my back, and fall asleep.
[193:36.97]Still up there?
[193:42.33]Yeah, it's on there.
[193:45.59]Alright, back on the road.
[193:50.15]The emergency light.
[193:51.03]I don't need it.
[193:51.61]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[193:52.42]I have all the main supplies.
[193:53.44]Alright, poles on the right.
[193:57.48]Is there a horn?
[194:21.64]H?
[194:23.44]There is a horn.
[194:26.76]Bed.
[194:27.14]The bed.
[194:27.44]The bed.
[194:27.70]The bed.
[194:28.04]The bed.
[194:28.32]Don't do anything idiotic.
[194:29.33]Don't.
[194:29.69]Okay.
[194:30.17]Slow down.
[194:30.49]I'm gonna have to readjust this bed.
[194:34.47]I forgot to take the poop.
[194:42.72]Okay.
[194:43.02]In a different playthrough, I would have taken every single shit I found and put it in the front seat until there's like 400 just right here stacked up.
[195:02.44]to play Highway to- No damage at all.
[195:18.67]Wait, what did I lose?
[195:19.43]I lost a couple of dinner plates.
[195:22.37]I put it back on.
[195:32.42]Okay.
[195:32.60]Come here.
[195:53.74]Okay.
[196:07.10]Good.
[196:11.06]What about the mirror?
[196:12.04]I don't need it.
[196:20.96]Rip mirror.
[196:23.00]Click the link.
[196:23.84]I can't right now.
[196:25.00]When I get to another gas station, I'll click the link.
[196:28.22]How much gas does this car have?
[196:29.41]I guess I can go out and just reach my hand in and see how far the line goes up my arm.
[196:35.38]That's not gonna help.
[196:36.64]I can't fucking see!
[196:39.16]Bed to bed to bed to bed to bed!
[196:42.06]I can't see anything!
[196:49.44]No, turn the fucking thing off!
[196:52.58]Stop.
[196:53.30]Do not.
[196:54.06]Thank you.
[196:57.83]Fuck the bed.
[196:58.73]I need it in about 10 seconds.
[197:13.92]I wish I could tie it down.
[197:14.82]Go on.
[197:34.35]This is good.
[197:34.87]This is the farthest I've ever been, by the way.
[197:42.14]I've not gone further than this.
[197:46.12]Grab it?
[197:52.87]What did I just grab?
[197:53.63]What the hell is this?
[197:58.37]Where are my lights?
[197:59.09]Why is the road so beat up right now?
[198:14.37]Rip bed.
[198:14.65]What do you mean rip bed?
[198:17.41]It's still up there.
[198:18.01]It didn't fall off.
[198:18.55]I don't think it did.
[198:20.41]I'm going to get hit by a rock.
[198:37.62]I know it's going to appear.
[198:38.66]I got to slow down.
[198:49.97]It's not.
[198:50.51]I don't think it's even funny anymore.
[199:01.58]Just spam it.
[199:06.02]No, I gotta... And that's how you lose the bed.
[199:09.56]Why am I spinning?
[199:11.87]That's how you lose the fucking bed.
[199:13.27]Thanks.
[199:14.41]Why'd you tell me to do that?
[199:15.21]Where's the bed?
[199:31.39]That is long gone.
[199:35.21]Let's go.
[199:36.75]Go on.
[199:37.77]Hurry up.
[199:38.17]Buy a cactus.
[199:46.82]What is this?
[199:47.44]It's annoying me.
[199:52.49]Blind?
[199:53.13]I drive by it.
[199:58.36]No, how am I ever gonna sleep?
[200:06.05]Alright, I gotta get the bed.
[200:07.91]You're right.
[200:08.49]I can't just leave it.
[200:09.63]I took all the fucking trouble to go get it.
[200:24.63]Where is it?
[200:33.27]Where?
[200:33.49]Okay, there it is.
[200:42.30]Alright, it's time to go to sleep anyways.
[200:50.20]Those lights off.
[201:04.16]Leave the fucking bed, you pothead.
[201:06.37]Why am I a pothead?
[201:09.45]What?
[201:14.31]Oh, wrong way.
[201:16.59]Leave the bed, you pothead.
[201:18.23]Okay, let's get in it.
[201:23.79]Let's sleep.
[201:28.96]Is this the wrong way?
[201:34.97]I can't tell it's pitch black.
[201:58.95]I really wish I could somebody could drive the car when I'm sitting here.
[202:03.48]Alright.
[202:03.82]Don't worry.
[202:04.93]A bed percent is still strong.
[202:07.03]Don't worry.
[202:21.06]Cool.
[202:21.30]Let's go.
[202:33.48]Game is neat.
[202:33.98]Yeah, I mean, this game started as an F and immediately became a D because one full letter grade for a car.
[202:44.21]I mean, it's slowly climbed up to at least a C+.
[202:48.57]Somehow.
[202:52.83]Slow down.
[202:59.24]The FOV is fucked?
[203:00.36]Well, it's because I'm...
[203:03.07]Don't tell me I'm fucked up.
[203:04.75]Don't do it.
[203:05.53]Just let the car do what it wants.
[203:07.11]Don't fight that, okay?
[203:19.10]If I tried to fight that turn, I would have flipped over.
[203:28.85]That would not have happened with the yellow car.
[203:31.41]It really might have, though.
[203:38.09]I got plenty of gas.
[203:39.07]I got all my materials.
[203:40.11]This car is going to make it all the way.
[203:56.59]That's how you style kill somebody.
[204:09.17]Tail whipped him.
[204:11.99]360 no scope with a car.
[204:14.77]Sorry, excuse me.
[204:16.57]Bed car.
[204:18.42]Make sure we're accurate here.
[204:22.26]What is that?
[204:25.38]What's that thing on the left?
[204:32.84]Airfield?
[204:36.43]Is it actually an airfield?
[204:38.51]There are no planes in this game, is there?
[204:48.44]No, it's just a weirdly popping in cactus.
[204:59.49]Lane car bed.
[205:06.27]Just keep stacking shit on top.
[205:13.08]We got a building right here.
[205:16.80]Let's see.
[205:17.32]Alright, take it- I'm going way faster than I- When you zoom in like that, you don't have any idea just how fast you're fucking going.
[205:38.91]Bed joke again, -2.
[205:40.51]I just, look, I just want to get it to the next safe house so I can put it in there.
[205:49.59]I'm not trying, I'm not trying to be funny, I promise.
[205:52.81]I want to do this.
[205:55.62]This is, look, this has nothing to do with me making a joke.
[205:57.98]This has to do with me wanting something.
[206:09.41]I just want to get it over here.
[206:13.33]What is- is this like a bus stop?
[206:14.69]Alright, this is where we're going to drop the bed.
[206:21.89]Okay, you know like in- in like, uh... Spoilers for that- what's the Kojima game that came out and everybody- Okay, spoiler for Death Stranding.
[206:29.17]Okay, ready?
[206:30.62]I have to put this bed here because I want to leave it there for another player to come and sleep on the bed.
[206:35.80]Isn't that how that works?
[206:45.47]I just told you I was gonna- I just told you to- I'm warning that I was gonna talk about Death Stranding for a second.
[206:49.13]Oh, it's like a fort.
[206:54.05]That's a- that's pretty cool.
[206:57.41]What's this?
[207:05.53]A toilet?
[207:06.65]Some sort?
[207:07.91]This is nothing- this is nothing even here.
[207:09.17]Whoa!
[207:20.80]That's a new radiator.
[207:26.02]48 water, 34 oil, 18 alcohol.
[207:34.85]Oh, look at this piece of shit.
[207:37.69]This thing sucks.
[207:40.03]Coolant tank.
[207:40.87]Oh, wow.
[207:41.45]100% water.
[207:41.71]What?
[207:41.87]Not bad.
[207:54.74]I'm gonna take it with me in case I need it.
[208:15.17]I just have so many car parts in here.
[208:18.13]This is just hoarding, but with car vehicle parts.
[208:20.65]Like, why do I have this speedometer that I can't even use?
[208:22.59]What's the point of having this?
[208:26.02]I have an engine that I can't use.
[208:27.60]I have speedometers.
[208:29.54]I have wheels.
[208:31.80]Left?
[208:32.82]What?
[208:33.00]I can't use any of this shit.
[208:40.49]Is it a tower?
[208:51.59]There ain't no tower left.
[208:52.33]What are you talking about?
[208:54.53]There's that!
[208:55.01]I mean, we're gonna- that's where we're going right now.
[208:56.44]The goal is to go to that weird tea tower.
[209:08.28]What is that?
[209:08.66]Teen Titans Tower.
[209:11.12]Oh, wait.
[209:11.28]Are we talking about Teen Titans Original or Teen Titans... Let's Eat Tacos and... and... mess around in... every episode.
[209:20.12]We don't actually do anything.
[209:20.95]We just, like, eat tacos.
[209:24.22]Right?
[209:24.38]You know, it's like, let's fight that enemy!
[209:30.84]Versus tacos!
[209:34.06]Which one, which version are you talking about?
[209:46.47]You'll never get away with this!
[209:48.47]Ah, Sandler!
[209:50.41]Versus ice cream party!
[209:54.48]What's the guy's name?
[209:56.72]Slap?
[209:57.20]What's his name?
[209:58.96]It's not Sandler, I know, but what's his name?
[210:04.75]Slade, yes.
[210:09.31]Slap Sandler.
[210:16.95]Boat.
[210:20.19]Wait, Boat or Teen Titans?
[210:25.44]There's two boats.
[210:29.84]Teen Titans?
[210:30.36]Okay.
[210:52.74]I don't want to smash into a rock.
[210:55.20]Look both ways.
[210:57.92]What?
[211:02.46]This actually looks kind of interesting.
[211:03.96]This is the most interesting thing so far this whole playthrough.
[211:06.11]Please stop driving.
[211:12.01]Okay, I can't read.
[211:13.09]Please stop driving so fast.
[211:14.11]It's terrifying.
[211:15.65]I'm in complete control of this vehicle.
[211:18.65]Don't worry.
[211:30.37]Just avoid... Damn, what is that thing?
[211:33.09]Does the horn wear out?
[211:59.11]5G.
[212:00.17]Not a 5G tower.
[212:03.65]You're alerting the horde.
[212:16.44]Witch!
[212:26.64]Am I going fast?
[212:27.41]Yeah.
[212:39.42]Alright, let's investigate.
[212:41.08]Off.
[212:42.22]Break.
[212:46.61]Done.
[212:48.29]I'm ready to go.
[212:53.75]Don't go anywhere.
[213:00.97]Well, okay.
[213:02.27]Guys, ever stand up to a really tall building, go like this, and look straight up?
[213:05.29]You will fall backwards.
[213:06.97]Your body, it's like an equilibrium thing.
[213:08.36]You'll fall all the way backwards.
[213:09.20]Don't do it.
[213:15.90]Your door?
[213:16.36]Oh.
[213:19.08]Wait a minute.
[213:20.58]What is this?
[213:24.40]Why can I turn that?
[213:25.52]What is the point?
[213:28.32]This is a water tank.
[213:32.42]What?
[213:39.33]How do I turn it off?
[213:54.38]Turn it off?
[213:55.14]Oh no, I'm gonna be the reason why the whole town runs out of water.
[214:00.66]Smooth open close?
[214:04.80]Let's take a shower.
[214:33.11]This is going to be like really fucking weird.
[214:37.44]Hold on.
[214:37.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[214:40.16]Where's my bed?
[214:40.66]Turn this off.
[214:54.07]There's no monsters going to be there.
[214:56.95]I know I left it at the bus stop.
[214:57.89]It's okay.
[214:58.13]There's no monsters over by the water tank.
[215:04.40]Click on the spout.
[215:06.10]Click on the spout.
[215:07.04]I will.
[215:07.48]I want it to be light out.
[215:16.61]Fill the new coolant.
[215:17.75]I could.
[215:30.04]Can I just do the wicked fucked up thing that I think is not fun?
[215:32.36]No one's gonna think it's funny, but I will for one second or I'll regret doing it.
[215:35.75]Let's find out.
[215:36.27]Holy shit, those arms.
[216:12.24]I can't see it.
[216:51.35]It's not funny at all actually.
[216:54.31]It's the complete opposite.
[217:07.86]The water is running down my head and I'm drinking it.
[217:18.18]that that's enough of that turn this shit off what else can I do with this should I wash the car?
[217:35.82]crouch down and mouse scroll
[217:47.07]Why is this happening?
[217:51.67]I'm like a gorilla.
[218:13.18]Alright, that's enough of that.
[218:14.28]Let's go.
[218:22.73]Oh, this thing was cool.
[218:24.09]I can't... Can I climb it?
[218:26.53]Just leave it running.
[218:27.37]You're a monster.
[218:30.25]You're a monster.
[218:30.97]More, more, more.
[218:39.04]There's a ladder on the other side, is there?
[218:42.22]I see a ladder.
[218:52.01]Alright, well that was cool.
[218:55.31]Get outta here.
[218:57.35]You just wasted 200 liters of water on a piss joke.
[219:03.35]That's right, I did.
[219:06.89]And I would do it again too.
[219:09.47]You fucking kids.
[219:24.07]Can I drink it out the window?
[219:28.67]Wait, can I drink it out the window and piss out this window?
[219:31.31]No!
[219:31.65]Just go!
[219:32.31]Just go!
[219:33.01]Fuck it, who cares?
[219:33.93]Alright, now with the- I drove all the way in the middle of nowhere for this.
[219:45.56]Where do I go now?
[219:46.20]This way?
[220:02.07]Over here.
[220:05.00]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[220:07.70]Over this way.
[220:08.22]I think.
[220:19.34]Coolant omega lull.
[220:23.81]Go back left.
[220:25.97]What the fuck is that?
[220:26.97]Is that another?
[220:28.11]Wait, there's another water tower?
[220:29.69]Oh shit, there's another one.
[220:34.06]And it's a boat.
[220:59.12]Play X-Men Origins, ResidentSleeper.
[221:01.42]What are you talking about?
[221:06.53]Same joke.
[221:07.15]No, I'm not stopping.
[221:08.87]Look, I'm just saying that there's one there.
[221:17.80]Too fast.
[221:19.22]Too fast.
[221:19.86]Tree coming.
[221:28.78]I can just dump the... I can fill everything up again.
[221:35.82]Why not put X-Men Origins?
[221:37.14]Is that game any good?
[221:45.96]No.
[221:54.77]It's better than the movie.
[221:58.00]Alright, look, you only get one weird Xbox 360 request a month.
[222:01.97]Alright, this thing is weighing the car down somehow.
[222:16.23]Hopefully you're in the movies more.
[222:17.91]I probably will eventually.
[222:19.00]Alright, let's get some gas.
[222:31.57]Break.
[222:33.33]Okay.
[222:35.17]How much gas is in this tank?
[222:38.47]Run off the headlights?
[222:39.19]I'm fine.
[222:41.31]Oh my god.
[222:42.43]We haven't even used... We haven't even used two-tenths of a liter.
[222:48.81]I might as well just throw a firework in here.
[222:50.67]Might as well just shoot this.
[222:56.66]What's the point of coming here?
[222:57.94]Alright, we're gonna blow this boat up.
[223:03.12]I'm gonna do- I'm gonna drive by and fire through there.
[223:06.24]I'm gonna get a safe distance away.
[223:17.00]You need oil.
[223:18.24]Ooooh! Yeah! Yep!
[223:36.46]We can put the new engine in.
[223:37.36]This is going to be such a pog moment.
[223:42.12]I can't wait.
[223:47.47]Wait.
[223:49.87]Why does this engine look way cooler than this engine?
[223:52.81]This engine... This looks like Bowser's engine and this is like Koopa's engine.
[224:03.32]It's the same person, kind of.
[224:04.40]You know, the turtle.
[224:07.21]Alright, let's get oil.
[224:13.71]Oil.
[224:15.89]Gas.
[224:16.47]Nope.
[224:19.23]Gas.
[224:20.89]Alcohol.
[224:31.98]Gas and oil.
[224:33.46]I don't think there's a barrel of oil in it.
[224:37.45]Diesel!
[224:39.03]Oh, shit.
[224:43.91]That's for a big one.
[224:44.76]Nice, good.
[224:53.78]Alright, is this engine like a three-, four-stroke?
[225:02.70]What par is this engine?
[225:03.96]I don't know anything about this shit.
[225:05.06]Am I doing this right?
[225:14.83]Just... That's it?
[225:23.83]Okay.
[225:24.89]Sounds good.
[225:26.41]Cap this up.
[225:26.83]Let's get it in there.
[225:31.83]Boom.
[225:34.18]Boom.
[225:37.52]Nice.
[225:37.72]Can I change this coolant tank to a better coolant?
[225:50.13]I have that, right?
[225:50.77]Somewhere?
[225:51.06]Alright, wait a minute.
[225:59.90]This one is... This is 48% water, 38% oil, 14% alcohol.
[226:05.16]I feel like I'm going to fuck this ratio up.
[226:11.03]Should I bring some oil and alcohol and water over here?
[226:14.93]Dump it.
[226:16.55]Why?
[226:16.75]Okay.
[226:28.10]Just water.
[226:31.57]Oh, okay.
[226:32.59]I got water.
[226:34.87]Let's not use our water though.
[226:36.03]Let's use the house's water.
[226:40.61]Is there water in one of these?
[226:49.06]E is not gonna work.
[226:52.64]R slash water.
[226:59.01]P is not going to work.
[227:01.47]You're going to ruin this.
[227:06.38]Just P. If P works, I will be very surprised.
[227:40.07]It works.
[227:40.53]Okay.
[227:40.89]Well, I gotta drink something.
[228:01.26]Okay.
[228:05.96]Am I not getting it in?
[228:07.52]Why?
[228:14.86]Wait, it's... I'm peeing the oil out?
[228:17.28]I need water.
[228:21.30]Wait, there's water... Alright, where's the... Wait, isn't one of these, like, alcohol, water, and gas?
[228:27.76]My own filtration system.
[228:31.56]One of these is... Come on.
[228:33.56]Come on.
[228:34.00]Come on!
[228:36.20]Come on!
[228:38.18]Come on.
[228:40.65]Come on.
[228:42.85]None of these...
[228:44.49]Oh, gas, oil, and diesel.
[228:46.28]No, that's not what I want.
[228:51.48]Empty.
[228:52.00]Yeah, of course it is.
[228:52.98]Get out of here.
[228:55.90]Gas, oil, and diesel.
[228:57.40]Get this out of here.
[229:00.33]Oil.
[229:03.21]What's this?
[229:05.53]Look at the water.
[229:06.57]Oil, no.
[229:08.01]Gas, no.
[229:11.98]What's this?
[229:14.22]Empty.
[229:15.54]Empty.
[229:15.84]Fuck it.
[229:16.26]I'm just gonna drink the water.
[229:20.26]What about that water tower nearby?
[229:21.58]Yeah, we'll have to go drink and then pee into it.
[229:25.50]I can't- I mean, I guess we could just go do that.
[229:36.59]Let me fill this up.
[229:37.85]I have a water tank in here.
[229:41.72]This one right here.
[229:54.75]Okay, fill it up.
[229:58.13]No, don't drink it.
[229:59.15]I want to fill this.
[230:03.05]That's alright for now.
[230:17.97]Water, oil, and alcohol.
[230:24.47]It's going to explode.
[230:30.31]Where?
[230:37.12]If I put this in here, is the car going to turn on?
[230:38.58]Yes or no?
[230:45.30]Yes.
[230:47.24]Hope you're right.
[230:51.31]This engine is good.
[230:52.17]Alright, we have a new engine and new stuff.
[230:57.21]Ooh, listen to that purr.
[231:00.76]Ooh, nice.
[231:09.22]Wait, just sleep.
[231:11.44]Turn the car off.
[231:18.47]Turn the car off.
[231:18.95]Turn the car off.
[231:24.19]The engine's not even on.
[231:28.51]Okay, what?
[231:29.35]Go.
[231:34.94]Still going.
[231:36.68]Don't hit a rock.
[231:43.48]Okay, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[231:46.03]Oh, you know I have to fucking go like 80 miles per hour and sleep.
[231:50.01]Right?
[231:50.33]Like, I have to try.
[232:01.42]Self-driving car thing actually moves now alright where am I going?
[232:09.49]The hell do I need to go the water tower?
[232:12.03]It's so far away.
[232:12.79]No.
[232:13.03]I don't care.
[232:13.49]I need the road Get out of here water tower.
[232:23.95]I need the road.
[232:24.75]I don't want to die
[232:54.28]Back door, back door.
[232:55.14]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[232:56.16]I'm good, I'm good.
[233:07.49]Nothing flew out the back?
[233:09.95]Nothing flew out.
[233:23.46]Okay, here we are.
[233:29.01]That's coming in fast.
[233:37.43]Alright, let's get to the spigot.
[233:42.90]Okay.
[233:50.08]Oh, that's just a crack in the wall.
[233:51.14]Never mind.
[234:30.09]Drink.
[234:38.82]Is this Death Stranding?
[234:40.10]I made that joke already.
[235:07.77]Move.
[235:13.82]Close the cap.
[235:15.74]Ooh, yeah.
[235:18.12]I probably should close the cap.
[235:28.97]Fill the water tank.
[235:29.79]Yep.
[235:49.94]Come on, Phil.
[235:51.96]Phil!
[235:53.34]Feel it!
[236:00.31]Feel it!
[236:00.55]Alright, let's pull.
[236:10.89]Oh my, good.
[236:27.83]Just fucking fill it.
[236:48.96]We're out.
[236:53.68]This is turning- this is a legitimate pee-pee poo-poo stream.
[236:56.70]It is not.
[236:59.90]I'm better than that.
[237:00.66]Come on.
[237:08.46]Alright.
[237:09.48]From here, where's the road to keep progressing?
[237:12.06]Is it left?
[237:17.32]Or is it right?
[237:18.48]I think it's this way.
[237:23.95]It's like right here, isn't it?
[237:29.04]Oh my god, Shimpa.
[237:30.66]Shimpa just gave another 20 community subs.
[237:34.40]You are a madman.
[237:35.28]2, 4, 6, 8.
[237:36.12]That's 80 community subs from Shimpa.
[237:40.88]Do a monkey noise.
[237:41.76]Look at that shiny hood.
[237:57.76]Good.
[238:03.82]Curious George?
[238:05.40]Curious George didn't talk.
[238:06.38]He didn't make any monkey noises.
[238:09.18]And he just pointed stuff.
[238:12.50]And that guy with a really, really weird fashion sense took care of him.
[238:18.80]The guy that was going to like a Dick Tracy convention every single day.
[238:21.33]He had... Oh.
[238:23.87]Oh.
[238:24.47]Oh.
[238:24.65]Oh.
[238:25.11]Oh.
[238:25.27]Oh.
[238:25.75]Oh.
[238:40.15]I turned around, though, this way, right?
[238:41.30]Is that the road?
[238:42.80]There it is.
[238:51.66]You said you were gonna blow up the boat.
[238:53.79]Ah, plans change, though.
[238:54.77]Okay, we've been playing this game for four hours.
[239:01.61]That's the biggest shock to me.
[239:04.67]Watch out, there's rocks incoming.
[239:10.09]Alright, that did slow me down a little.
[239:23.53]Been four hours.
[239:24.25]Yeah, it has.
[239:26.87]Well, no, I don't need any materials.
[239:28.31]I need to go to, I need to find a new gas station with a new awesome car.
[239:31.74]I've been driving this piece of shit around the whole time.
[239:42.54]Wait, what is this?
[239:44.78]Is this a little house?
[239:45.60]Ooh, wait a minute.
[239:46.30]This is a little house.
[239:54.18]Is there a car?
[239:54.60]There's a car here.
[239:55.16]Ooh, what do you got in there for an engine?
[240:02.57]Oh, shit.
[240:02.97]What is this place?
[240:03.53]Okay, cool.
[240:09.43]What's this thing?
[240:16.68]Okay, is this good?
[240:18.27]No, that's the same engine that I had before.
[240:20.45]Sucks.
[240:24.49]This car is made of clay.
[240:33.53]Pretty good room back here.
[240:34.41]Is it gas?
[240:41.81]Alright, is there any gas in it?
[240:48.56]It's a much nicer car though.
[240:53.82]Steal the dash.
[240:55.20]Oh shit, you're right.
[241:03.60]Shitty engine.
[241:06.57]Back in business.
[241:08.05]Look at that.
[241:09.05]Perfect.
[241:09.43]It's a perfect fit.
[241:19.17]Investigate here.
[241:19.77]Can I open these doors?
[241:31.58]It's in an alien language.
[241:34.92]Can I not even get in here?
[241:37.74]Can't... Look, there's shit in here.
[241:42.76]How do I get in?
[241:46.59]Oh.
[241:46.71]Oh.
[241:49.96]Oh boy, this is, this is, oh yeah.
[241:54.14]Yep.
[241:56.52]Lot of parts in here.
[241:57.94]Now what do I want to do with these?
[242:02.51]What's this guy?
[242:04.13]What kind of, what kind of engine is this guy?
[242:05.97]This looks like a pretty cool engine.
[242:07.37]What do you think?
[242:08.91]What's happening?
[242:14.88]Gun, gun, gun, gun, gun.
[242:17.12]What do you mean gun?
[242:18.80]Is there a gun?
[242:23.47]I already have a gun.
[242:24.13]I already have this.
[242:29.64]I have a gun.
[242:35.97]Is blood in here?
[242:39.03]Why is there blood in here?
[242:55.40]I think I want the blood.
[242:56.28]I'm going to take the... Wait, should I dump it out to, like, attract the animals?
[243:03.32]Oh, fuck this.
[243:03.84]Get this out of here.
[243:04.37]I don't want this thing.
[243:05.97]Disgusting.
[243:07.51]It's a better gun?
[243:08.37]A big tire.
[243:14.27]What's this?
[243:19.51]What's this thing?
[243:19.93]I don't know what any of this stuff does.
[243:29.72]It's a microphone.
[243:33.48]It's a better gun?
[243:34.96]No, it's not a better gun.
[243:37.34]Okay, but what about this engine?
[243:42.96]These engines look... I don't know.
[243:44.88]Is one of them better than the other?
[243:46.24]Let's examine them.
[243:56.45]There's a big one over here.
[244:00.91]Another gun.
[244:08.07]The same gun.
[244:09.01]Yeah, it's the same thing.
[244:13.70]Oh, blue paint.
[244:14.68]Yes.
[244:16.00]It was worth coming in here.
[244:19.78]Don't spill this.
[244:39.14]How much paint is in here?
[244:40.10]This is bullshit.
[244:47.88]It's just rusted.
[244:49.66]This car, it really, it's got made out of concrete.
[244:57.58]Why is this car concrete?
[245:01.94]Oh, why am I sleeping?
[245:08.75]It's a shotgun.
[245:16.41]No, it's not!
[245:17.17]Where am I?
[245:23.57]What's going on with my body?
[245:29.11]Oh.
[245:29.85]What's going on?
[245:32.94]Why am I behind myself?
[245:39.80]What did I do?
[245:41.38]Q?
[245:42.58]Oh, shit.
[245:42.96]Okay, there we go.
[245:43.46]Alright, we're good.
[245:47.06]Uh, let's blow this place up.
[245:49.58]Let's push this car over here and fuck this car.
[245:51.32]Fuck the clay car.
[245:54.64]I got a concrete car.
[246:04.05]I'm gonna get very far away.
[246:05.27]Don't worry.
[246:17.56]Oh shit.
[246:20.74]Sit.
[246:21.24]No, don't sit in there.
[246:30.11]Alright, so this isn't a good spot.
[246:32.51]Take this out.
[246:33.55]There's oil right there too.
[246:34.63]This is going to be a disaster.
[246:35.99]I need to get very far away.
[246:39.73]There it is.
[246:40.47]Perfect angle.
[246:41.07]Let's get in my car and let's fuck off.
[247:02.15]Save the game, yep.
[247:03.39]Good call.
[247:03.77]Okay, this is probably far... Is this far enough away?
[247:08.26]I mean, it's not a... It's not a nuke.
[247:14.68]It's not a nuclear bomb.
[247:32.96]Nice!
[247:33.30]Alright, back on the road.
[247:56.53]Sleep in the car.
[247:57.69]Okay.
[248:01.21]Wrong way.
[248:01.89]Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[248:03.43]Alright.
[248:03.69]I'll sleep on the road, but I'll make sure the game is saved.
[248:07.78]I'm going to go like 150 miles per hour and then sleep. 80.
[248:25.80]Yeah, save it.
[248:26.34]I'm going to save it right here.
[248:27.22]Is there money on the ground?
[248:30.12]Alright, save.
[248:32.53]We're in a perfect spot.
[248:34.33]Back it up.
[248:35.19]Here we go.
[248:40.81]Get this to about 120.
[248:41.43]And then I'm going to hold V.
[248:54.86]I actually might make it.
[248:57.35]If it's a straight enough straightaway, I should be fine.
[249:00.85]We'll see.
[249:01.25]Okay, now is a pretty good time to go to sleep.
[249:18.21]That's efficiency right there.
[249:28.62]It's the rock in my sleep.
[249:43.37]It's the DeLorean I time traveled.
[249:47.96]Morty!
[249:48.64]No, it's not Morty.
[249:49.32]It's Marty!
[250:01.97]What's that?
[250:02.95]What was that?
[250:03.65]That was weird.
[250:04.24]That was a weird thing in the road.
[250:07.56]Well, that was a weird thing in the road, wasn't it?
[250:11.26]Nah, who cares?
[250:15.64]Let's go.
[250:17.78]Save it again?
[250:18.24]Sure.
[250:20.84]Not a bad idea.
[250:27.76]Go to the rock.
[250:31.16]How many kilometers have I gone so far, you think?
[250:32.88]I've been on the same tank of gas.
[250:36.76]I have so much gas in the backseat, too.
[250:38.96]There's so much gas.
[250:51.17]I haven't even used a tenth of a liter.
[251:00.66]We only measure in miles.
[251:03.95]Well, that's just what my brain has to do because I grew up in the one place on Earth that they did that.
[251:10.25]Rocking the road, rocking the road, rocking the road.
[251:12.13]Oh.
[251:29.84]Ascension.
[251:30.44]Can't even go past 120?
[251:31.28]Come on, we need a better one.
[251:34.97]Somebody said PRESS B and it fucked up everything.
[251:39.11]Ban that person.
[251:39.63]The person that just said press B, I want them timed out for 30 seconds.
[251:49.76]Oh.
[251:58.24]It's going to take 30 seconds to find them.
[251:59.78]Alright, we'll just pretend they got timed out.
[252:04.61]I have to investigate this because it could be a truck.
[252:06.43]If there's a bus or anything, it's possible.
[252:17.53]No.
[252:18.59]Sad, sad, sad, sad, sad.
[252:20.81]What is it?
[252:22.93]Sadja?
[252:23.33]It's a J?
[252:26.23]Sage?
[252:26.61]How do you say it?
[252:42.27]This is an interesting little spot right here.
[252:44.13]Anything here?
[252:44.69]Rolling up like this.
[252:47.59]Alright, what do you got?
[252:48.37]A bumper?
[252:51.13]Hmm.
[252:51.91]What do you got?
[252:57.53]What's in there?
[252:59.40]Gas!
[253:00.22]Just use it!
[253:10.48]Blood.
[253:10.74]Put blood in the tank.
[253:17.60]Oh, yeah.
[253:18.70]Yep.
[253:19.53]Thank God.
[253:19.99]I can actually wash the car now.
[253:26.95]What gold?
[253:27.45]I don't even want it.
[253:28.15]It's stupid.
[253:29.41]Here's the thing I was talking about.
[253:33.58]What is this?
[253:34.20]There's a secret engine in here.
[253:40.60]How do I get it?
[253:41.04]There's an engine in there.
[254:20.78]I'll get up.
[254:24.58]Check this shit out.
[254:38.55]Was the last save?
[254:40.91]I don't know.
[254:41.41]I don't remember.
[254:41.83]Was this one here?
[254:44.47]No, it was after.
[254:45.13]Where is it?
[254:47.39]Oh, it's right here.
[254:47.93]Look at the autosave.
[255:03.55]God damn it, I had it.
[255:10.63]Yeah.
[255:11.11]Think you can fucking trap me in there?
[255:12.27]Don't think so.
[255:12.88]Give me that.
[255:26.63]Hmm.
[255:27.07]Polishing concrete.
[255:29.19]Looks pretty good.
[255:29.99]You know what I think?
[255:49.19]Better than ever, I think.
[256:13.21]Wash the concrete away.
[256:14.51]That's not how that works.
[256:30.73]Too bright.
[256:33.94]It was working?
[256:35.68]It was working.
[256:40.08]I can't go back for a sponge.
[256:41.58]I've yeeted it into the sun.
[256:43.24]There'll be more sponges.
[256:59.45]No, there won't be.
[257:00.25]Yes, there will.
[257:01.39]That's like sponge number 10 we found in the game so far.
[257:03.63]We're going to be fine.
[257:04.18]I'm going to lose control if I don't stop.
[257:19.11]No telephone pole.
[257:19.69]No telephone pole.
[257:20.23]No telephone pole.
[257:20.81]We're fine.
[257:29.68]Uh, back on the road.
[257:34.99]Every sponge is personalized.
[257:36.39]Oh, pretty good tuber voice.
[257:42.40]I had to do it.
[257:55.20]Not that there's a lot of people here.
[257:57.23]I do want to make sure I let you know.
[257:59.61]Tomorrow.
[258:00.85]I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[258:03.21]I will be on Kitboga's stream.
[258:05.83]Popping in from time to time as a guest when he finds a good call.
[258:08.72]I already said press B. I just did.
[258:15.38]I'm going to host it so the stream will just be hosted the whole time.
[258:19.52]Maybe I'll pop in a little bit.
[258:20.62]Maybe we'll get a fun call going.
[258:24.66]That's the plan.
[258:25.90]I won't be live tomorrow on this channel.
[258:32.62]I have to have gone pretty far, right?
[258:40.02]What time is that stream at?
[258:41.74]That's a really good question because I know Kit starts streaming around 10, 9, 10 a.m.
[258:48.95]Pacific, right?
[258:50.49]Somewhere around maybe noon, Eastern, when he typically starts.
[258:55.59]So I'm going to assume somewhere around like 10 to 12 Pacific is when I'll be on, maybe.
[259:05.54]Maybe a little later, maybe a little earlier, depending on if he gets a call that he likes, that's good.
[259:20.98]This has been pretty clean so far at 130 plus.
[259:25.28]140 now.
[259:25.62]This is it.
[259:28.15]It's over.
[259:28.43]It's over.
[259:28.75]It's over.
[259:29.09]No, it's not.
[259:29.37]Just calm down and go through the gap.
[259:30.91]Okay, we're good.
[259:34.71]Just let the car ride a little.
[259:35.97]Let the car ride.
[259:36.65]Brake, brake, brake, brake, brake, brake.
[259:38.35]You're good.
[259:39.17]Watch out for that tiny rock.
[259:43.32]What happened?
[259:43.82]Why did the oil come out?
[259:46.14]I need that.
[259:48.54]What happened?
[259:49.04]Let's assess the damage.
[259:49.84]Hold on.
[259:55.10]How did I get out of there?
[259:55.82]Did I slip through?
[260:07.07]Did I lose a tire?
[260:08.91]Hold on, I lost a tire.
[260:15.57]I think I did.
[260:16.11]Fuck.
[260:28.26]No, I didn't lose it.
[260:28.82]Why is there a tire out here?
[260:35.78]Oh, that's the spare?
[260:37.10]Why does it look like shit?
[260:39.66]Alright, we need to- I gotta recalibrate this.
[260:41.12]Hold on.
[260:43.90]Right over a fucking stone.
[260:44.98]Alright, get in there.
[260:49.28]Long ways, please.
[260:50.96]Long ways.
[260:58.56]Wait, it won't fit anymore?
[261:01.88]Thank you.
[261:09.04]You don't need the barrel?
[261:10.12]I have to take the barrel.
[261:12.28]The only way I feel comfortable.
[261:14.42]Fuck the spear.
[261:15.14]Just get it.
[261:15.46]I don't even care.
[261:16.38]I don't care.
[261:19.80]Get me the fuck out of here.
[261:40.86]My gamer growth hurts so much.
[261:54.13]Oh, there's a bunch of people that might not have been here.
[261:59.23]You had to be there.
[261:59.93]That's all I can say.
[262:01.18]That's really all I'm going to say.
[262:07.54]Oh shit, I'm going 140.
[262:10.60]Oh my god, I'm going 140.
[262:12.32]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[262:15.27]It's okay.
[262:18.21]Don't touch anything.
[262:18.91]Ooh, I just missed it.
[262:23.93]I just missed it.
[262:24.95]Break.
[262:25.54]Let's go.
[262:34.04]What?
[262:34.32]No... Here's the surprising thing.
[262:36.22]No... New gas station.
[262:38.57]You guys remember when I actually thought that I was going to be able to fucking walk?
[262:45.21]Thank God I actually restarted.
[262:47.57]I would still be walking to that gas station.
[262:55.88]And there would be like... 1100 people still here.
[263:01.70]Thank God.
[263:15.31]Why did that happen?
[263:24.28]It just clipped.
[263:25.34]I just clipped it.
[263:29.80]It just got clipped a little.
[263:30.86]I lost something?
[263:34.14]What did I lose?
[263:41.81]I didn't lose anything.
[263:43.93]Everything looks... Wait.
[263:45.25]Everything seems to be in order.
[263:53.52]No, I didn't lose anything.
[263:54.28]Did I get my gold bar?
[264:06.47]I lost a hubcap.
[264:07.35]That's okay.
[264:10.23]Alright, slow down because the sun is unbearable.
[264:12.09]Stop driving, you're losing gas.
[264:23.85]Yes.
[264:25.00]I am.
[264:28.10]That's a big building coming up, finally.
[264:32.96]Slow down, I can't see shit.
[264:36.10]I'd rather hit something going 30 than hit something going 80.
[264:41.02]It's the thing you pull down.
[264:42.36]Oh, right.
[264:42.84]I threw it out the window.
[264:45.38]That's a big building.
[264:56.71]I'm doing the Ace Ventura Jim Carrey thing.
[264:59.33]This is loud as hell.
[265:14.24]Look at that big house.
[265:35.98]Am I okay?
[265:49.22]I'm fine.
[265:50.12]The car is fine.
[265:52.40]Cool.
[265:52.88]Alright.
[265:53.26]Nice.
[265:53.57]Look at this big ass house.
[266:03.45]Yes.
[266:04.07]A bike.
[266:05.36]But I don't know how to work it.
[266:07.32]Fuel tank empty.
[266:11.74]Gas.
[266:12.04]Alright.
[266:13.96]Pick this shit up.
[266:14.96]I want to get this to work.
[266:16.08]I'm going to ride a goddamn bike.
[266:25.29]No, please don't.
[266:26.19]What do you mean?
[266:28.50]No wheels.
[266:29.28]I can get wheels.
[266:29.98]I have plenty of wheels.
[266:34.24]Why can I not fill this?
[266:45.74]How much gas does it need?
[266:47.50]What's the combo?
[266:52.65]Hold on.
[267:00.13]Get gun, get new, that new, that's a new gun.
[267:03.17]Not a new gun.
[267:03.79]What's this?
[267:28.12]Sink?
[267:30.16]What's this?
[267:32.18]What actually is this?
[267:36.47]It's a trailer!
[267:38.15]Holy shit, it's a trailer.
[267:41.53]Can I use it?
[267:46.95]I hope I can actually attach this thing.
[267:48.97]Put the bed in here.
[267:51.08]Oh my god.
[267:53.00]Yeah.
[267:54.24]There are no wheels on it, but it's okay.
[267:55.70]I think I can still probably attach it.
[268:01.44]Alright, stay right there.
[268:11.63]It is that and then here, right?
[268:18.37]I can't pick it up.
[268:19.23]I can just push it.
[268:20.99]Other way.
[268:22.17]Other way.
[268:28.37]Damn it.
[268:28.65]I thought that was going to be awesome.
[268:43.00]Is it going to attach?
[268:47.88]Make a train.
[268:48.66]I don't think I can attach this.
[268:54.85]Press F to hold it.
[268:56.27]Grab the end of it.
[269:01.66]Oh, yeah.
[269:03.52]Yes.
[269:04.42]Yes.
[269:05.32]Yes.
[269:06.28]Yes.
[269:07.24]Yes.
[269:08.61]Yes.
[269:10.67]Yes.
[269:11.49]And I can bring this.
[269:12.77]I can bring the bike.
[269:13.49]I can actually carry it.
[269:15.83]What's happening?
[269:16.77]Stop.
[269:24.16]I'm going to bring this bike wherever I want now.
[269:26.54]I'm going to find wheels for it.
[269:31.59]Excellent.
[269:32.95]And the bed?
[269:33.33]I don't think the bed's not gonna fit on there.
[269:39.61]This thing is too big.
[269:40.25]What's wrong with me?
[269:48.90]Why am I hearing bells?
[269:54.16]I died?
[270:02.63]Who's the save?
[270:03.37]Here?
[270:03.59]The bed killed me.
[270:10.99]Wait, did I?
[270:11.27]Okay.
[270:11.51]That's weird.
[270:12.73]Oh, shit.
[270:28.38]Alright, bike.
[270:30.95]Are you sure I didn't die from, like, dehydration?
[270:37.49]That's not what happened, right?
[270:43.69]Cap the thing.
[270:44.37]Cap the thing.
[270:48.45]Well, I can't bring the bed, then.
[270:54.88]I'm sorry.
[270:55.36]I can't.
[270:56.76]I want to, but I can't.

[274:12.48]They're green.
[274:14.80]Should I just take a minute to brush them or whatever?
[274:16.68]I don't know why I thought that was like, well, it's like a funny thing I'll say.
[274:25.92]Like, that's not even funny.
[274:26.66]This is gross and strange.
[274:27.96]You're just a weird guy.
[274:29.08]It's disgusting, everybody.
[274:30.42]It's not like, oh, funny, huh?
[274:32.35]No, it's just gross.
[274:38.31]Alright, here we're back to the long road.
[274:44.70]What was I trying to do?
[274:45.26]Get on the roof?
[274:45.66]I don't think I can.
[274:56.98]Can't climb pipes.
[275:00.42]I brushed him right before the stream turned on, like five hours ago.
[275:04.59]I'm fine.
[275:05.05]I'm kidding.
[275:05.43]It was a joke.
[275:06.75]Oh, I need this.
[275:21.19]Put it in the back.
[275:21.65]It's kind of violent, but whatever.
[275:26.57]Alright, I got plenty of gas.
[275:30.09]I got my bike.
[275:30.73]I have my trailer.
[275:31.99]But I don't... I can't... I don't think I can get up there.
[275:36.22]Throw your teeth.
[275:36.94]No!
[275:37.36]That's too... That's way too intimate.
[275:40.38]Don't jump in there, stupid.
[275:43.20]That's too, like, person... I mean, personal.
[275:46.26]Oh, the bits.
[275:46.70]Right, right, right.
[275:47.13]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[275:47.47]Sorry.
[275:47.61]Sorry.
[275:49.11]Attack of the Hank gave five community subs.
[275:50.71]Thanks.
[275:51.13]Board of Bones gave $50.
[275:55.25]5,000 bits from Board of Bones.
[275:56.19]Been watching your videos for about seven years.
[275:58.45]Want to give huge thanks for all the entertainment throughout the years.
[276:00.36]You're the best.
[276:02.62]That's a long time.
[276:05.02]Hope you stick around for season eight.
[276:07.66]That's the season that everybody says to skip.
[276:10.81]And then we had Lorag for $50.
[276:12.72]Hey man, long time no see.
[276:13.70]You've left a couple dozen voicemails.
[276:16.06]But I guess they haven't been getting to you for some reason.
[276:17.82]Haha.
[276:18.69]Anyways, I just wanted to check up on you in chat.
[276:20.49]Hope you're all doing as well as you can.
[276:23.07]Except for Keith.
[276:23.79]He sucks.
[276:24.59]Sorry, Keith.
[276:25.60]Thank you, Lorag, for the 5,000 bits.
[276:28.59]Potion Dweller, 5,000 bits.
[276:30.09]Belated happy birthday.
[276:31.07]Just celebrated my yesterday.
[276:33.22]Question, have you considered doing any D&D streams with Ster and Arcadum?
[276:37.14]I think you'd be magnificent on them.
[276:39.16]I know your schedule tends to be a little crazy, but you should give it a go if you can work the time out.
[276:43.24]Well, I have something to tell you.
[276:45.44]Star is working on a custom sorcery-style D&D-like campaign that I'm going to be playing on stream.
[276:56.13]He's in the middle of doing it right now.
[277:00.17]It's going to be a choose-your-own-adventure game board.
[277:02.55]Custom made.
[277:06.15]I'm really looking forward to it.
[277:06.97]It should be good.
[277:08.77]I don't have a timetable on when it's going to be done because it's kind of... He's just going to do it.
[277:13.68]There's no like, oh, that'll be next week.
[277:16.50]But maybe by the end of the year, early next year, whenever he gets around to making it and doing it, there's no rush on it.
[277:23.76]So whenever it's ready, it should be a lot of fun.
[277:28.91]Thanks a lot, guys, though.
[277:29.59]Let's keep going.
[277:34.61]Show those teeth.
[277:35.51]No, I don't want to show you my teeth.
[277:39.79]There's only two people in the world that are gonna see my teeth.
[277:44.28]The dentist... and me.
[277:48.90]And I hate the dentist.
[277:51.22]Not because I don't like going to the dentist, I don't care.
[277:54.38]I don't like the dent- I don't like when they put the- when they- you open your mouth really wide and they take a look at every single inch and they can see everything.
[278:02.03]You can't hide shit from the dentist.
[278:05.17]And you think that you're so clever by brushing your teeth and flossing 20 minutes before you go?
[278:10.05]Look, aren't they clean?
[278:11.73]No, they're not.
[278:12.39]They're not.
[278:12.71]Not at all.
[278:13.39]That doesn't do anything.
[278:14.23]You think it does, but it doesn't.
[278:17.01]I haven't flossed in four and a half months.
[278:19.69]But look, I flossed.
[278:21.01]No, there's this buildup back there.
[278:22.54]They know what you're doing.
[278:23.52]You look like an asshole.
[278:24.22]Alright, how do I get up?
[278:31.08]I don't think I can't get up on the roof.
[278:32.76]I can't.
[278:36.67]Why are you such a tool?
[278:40.07]What?
[278:42.37]What do you mean?
[278:46.07]That kinda made me feel bad.
[278:47.45]I'm sorry, dude.
[278:55.27]Anyways, um...
[279:00.52]Yeah, that kind of just like, I don't know, that like really... They really just like threw me off.
[279:04.47]Yeah, alright, well, I'll see you guys later.
[279:06.17]That's, I don't know, it's like fucking with me, you know what I mean?
[279:11.51]Whatever!
[279:11.91]Alright, this is still connected, right?
[279:27.70]You need tires for the bike.
[279:29.16]Yeah, but there's none in there.
[279:31.74]I take it back.
[279:32.64]See?
[279:37.47]See?
[279:43.67]Oh, Raid from Tomato.
[279:44.95]What's up, Tomato?
[279:46.37]What's going on, everybody?
[279:47.21]Welcome.
[279:48.83]Thanks for the raid, Tomato.
[279:51.85]Hope you had a good stream, whatever you were just doing.
[279:53.79]Welcome, Raiders.
[279:57.61]You're witnessing a game called The Long Drive.
[280:03.15]You may or may not have seen it before.
[280:06.21]I am currently about 20 minutes away from the world record, so really trying to get that world record.
[280:12.17]Did the bike fall off?
[280:20.09]No, stop lying to me.
[280:20.99]What are you doing?
[280:27.50]No, but thanks a lot, Tomato.
[280:28.72]Hope you're doing well.
[280:29.44]Thanks for the raid.
[280:32.36]Let's continue our quest.
[280:33.36]If you don't know Tomato, go follow him right now.
[280:34.84]What are you, crazy?
[280:42.94]Water Tower or the Pyramid?
[280:45.30]Keep your eyes on the road.
[280:49.70]Sing the Welcome Raiders song.
[280:54.40]No, because even the Welcome Raiders song joke song will make them all leave.
[280:58.49]I know it will.
[280:59.11]Trust me.
[281:02.01]Pay attention.
[281:02.83]Don't... Okay, I'm going too fast.
[281:05.57]I got a carriage now.
[281:06.49]I got a carriage.
[281:08.79]I need two tires and I need a battery.
[281:11.39]Were you guys lying about the battery or what?
[281:17.30]Actually, it is kind of like a pyramid.
[281:18.52]Can I go in there?
[281:22.92]You need four tires on the bike?
[281:27.66]No, you don't.
[281:28.12]It's a bike.
[281:29.48]The reason why it's called a bicycle is because two wheels.
[281:33.00]And it's a sickle.
[281:35.25]Where I have something.
[281:35.93]I don't know.
[281:46.13]Cycle.
[281:46.55]Yeah.
[281:47.39]It's a two cycle.
[281:48.28]It means it's two wheels on the bike.
[281:58.78]What's that noise?
[282:01.37]What is that sound?
[282:07.15]Stop!
[282:10.49]What's the problem?
[282:11.05]Oh, this doesn't have wheels, right.
[282:12.88]This doesn't have wheels.
[282:22.38]Is it smoking?
[282:29.57]No, it's fine.
[282:31.47]It's smoking, but whatever.
[282:34.47]Get your hand off.
[282:34.95]What are you doing?
[282:35.37]Get your hand off that.
[282:36.15]Get your hand off that.
[282:37.29]Why is he still holding it?
[282:39.29]Why is he still holding that and shaking it around?
[282:40.76]What's he doing?
[282:41.16]Stop that.
[282:47.70]Uh, who's behind this?
[282:49.42]It says right in the back seat holding a gun up to my body.
[282:53.60]Thrive!
[282:54.96]I'm going, man.
[282:55.54]I'm going.
[282:56.10]That's right.
[282:56.56]Keep going until you get to the bank.
[283:03.73]I'm doing that.
[283:04.43]It's okay.
[283:05.85]The screeching is me doing that.
[283:10.50]I can't go more than 40 miles per hour because the game's making me do this.
[283:16.64]I can't even hit the brake.
[283:28.98]Why won't he take his hand off the clutch?
[283:34.91]Take your hand off.
[283:36.71]Take your hand off.
[283:39.81]I'm sitting in the other seat.
[283:41.49]Okay, that... We're good.
[283:50.38]Okay, there we go.
[283:56.96]Still doing it.
[284:01.39]I need wheels for the bike.
[284:04.87]There we go.
[284:07.23]Get your hand off.
[284:08.64]Stop touching the clutch.
[284:09.94]Stop touching the transmission thing.
[284:15.24]Rip the clutch out and throw it out the window.
[284:16.60]I don't think you can.
[284:23.75]What is this bit?
[284:25.79]It's me driving the car.
[284:27.25]It's the whole game, man.
[284:35.52]That's not a clutch.
[284:36.48]You know what I mean.
[284:37.71]The stick that you move to drive the car.
[284:40.79]You put it in drive.
[284:41.47]You put it in reverse.
[284:43.17]Uh-oh.
[284:47.23]Gear stick.
[284:48.13]Yeah.
[284:49.48]You get it.
[284:49.88]Alright, what do you guys want for food?
[284:53.78]And by what do you want for food, I mean what should I get for food in like a minute when the stream ends?
[285:01.35]No, no McDonald's.
[285:02.13]I'm over that for now.
[285:09.77]Something going on in the back.
[285:10.59]Is the bike still there?
[285:12.29]It's still there.
[285:28.79]Mayonnaise sandwich.
[285:29.71]No thanks.
[285:30.07]That doesn't sound good.
[285:30.77]Italian food?
[285:33.29]Mmm.
[285:34.07]What kind?
[285:34.41]What kind?
[285:36.07]You mean like pasta?
[285:36.99]You mean like meatballs?
[285:38.21]What do you mean like
[285:39.88]Pizza?
[285:40.96]Eh, not into pizza right now.
[285:42.60]Something else.
[285:45.52]Free and food.
[285:46.08]Mmm, that's actually pretty, that sounds good.
[285:49.42]Waffle House, maybe.
[285:50.30]Hmm.
[286:03.47]I'll have to think about it.
[286:08.63]Get back to you later.
[286:16.40]Kiss me on the mouth.
[286:17.58]That's not food.
[286:19.58]But no.
[286:23.74]This thing is so hard to control because of the ship behind me.
[286:27.54]Okay.
[286:29.94]Just got a super speed boost somehow.
[286:32.34]I just did the Sonic... And then went forward.
[286:38.60]Interesting.
[286:39.10]Now I'm over 100.
[286:39.58]Is that thing still there?
[286:52.68]It's the, it's the little, it's the pole trailer behind me that's doing it.
[286:56.02]Going right for that pole.
[286:58.20]Aye.
[286:59.32]Oh, it's just bouncing around everywhere, ain't it?
[287:01.36]We're fine.
[287:11.61]Get rid of it, please.
[287:12.63]I'm still fine.
[287:19.01]Stop getting out.
[287:19.81]Well, I'm freaking out because I don't know if it's still there.
[287:24.33]I will put wheels on it, I will.
[287:25.61]Press B to check the bike.
[287:28.55]Alright, just making sure there's no shit on the seat.
[287:46.46]Wait, can I drive from the other seat?
[287:47.90]Can I grab the wheel from the passenger seat?
[288:02.17]Nope.
[288:08.73]Go inside the pyramid.
[288:13.39]I'm kind of... I really want to ride the motorcycle so bad.
[288:19.65]At full speed and not this bullshit pedaling with my feet thing.
[288:22.29]I want to go full speed.
[288:24.81]On the motorcycle.
[288:42.74]Is that a building?
[288:44.60]Oh god, this bullshit again.
[288:46.00]Alright, I need to... I was trying to block the sun out of my eyes.
[288:53.41]Alright, that's better.
[289:07.37]Sun's gone.
[289:13.08]It's fine.
[289:14.70]It's fine.
[289:15.04]It's fine.
[289:15.48]It's fine.
[289:15.90]We're fine.
[289:17.50]Are we?
[289:18.08]Are we, though?
[289:19.18]Are we, though?
[289:21.81]Are we, though?
[289:26.12]Oh, watch out for that thing!
[289:50.29]He's a pothead.
[289:51.21]I'm not- I'm not- I have none- I've had none today.
[289:55.37]I was feeling- I was feeling okay today.
[289:57.72]Chest-wise.
[289:58.42]I didn't- I don't need to take it right now.
[290:00.52]Stop saying that or you're gonna get banned.
[290:02.10]You f- Idiot.
[290:22.78]okay that somebody is standing right behind here crouching where the other tire is on the other side they scared me with a puppet and threw it behind them and then they're hiding under the car I'm gonna go investigate this fucking thing and the car's gonna take off god damn it man
[290:52.03]Hey, I told you I was going to need this.
[291:08.49]Great.
[291:08.87]I really used it well.
[291:09.93]Let's go.
[291:24.78]No, I'm not gonna bring Wilson.
[291:26.14]I need a new house.
[291:44.66]You have a nice hall.
[291:48.22]Please say that you'll play this again.
[291:49.64]I don't know.
[291:51.20]Maybe if it gets some more updates.
[291:52.48]Isn't it currently not done?
[291:56.90]I'm gonna hit that rock, aren't I?
[291:58.38]Nope.
[292:03.05]Sleep?
[292:21.17]Okay, the tank is now in the front seat.
[292:34.64]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[292:36.98]It's just draining into my mouth.
[292:44.61]Oh, goddammit.
[292:45.31]There's a thing right here, too.
[292:52.23]Just reload the bucket save.
[292:53.15]I don't care.
[292:54.03]Where is it?
[292:55.83]This one here, right?
[292:56.38]20, 09, 24, 16, 34.
[292:57.74]Which one is it?
[292:58.52]This one, right?
[293:05.49]This one.
[293:12.08]Reload Randy.
[293:13.86]Load last.
[293:14.78]Oh, oh shit.
[293:15.34]Okay.
[293:19.77]We're good.
[293:43.72]Why'd the car turn off?
[293:44.50]The bike is not gone.
[293:46.84]The bike is still there.
[293:51.16]There it is.
[293:51.64]There's the thing.
[293:52.24]The bike is there.
[293:55.80]Look.
[293:57.03]That's the bike.
[294:05.05]These little bus stops.
[294:06.03]Why can't I find a bus?
[294:07.73]I got one at the very beginning of the game.
[294:09.89]I didn't have any gas or any diesel.
[294:11.12]I couldn't use it.
[294:12.90]I want to drive a bus so bad.
[294:13.92]I have no idea.
[294:15.22]Alright, looking for tires.
[294:20.70]If I see a tire, I'm going to be really happy.
[294:25.82]I see one.
[294:28.16]I see a tire.
[294:29.02]That's kind of huge, though.
[294:41.90]Does this work?
[294:42.52]Can I even put it on?
[294:47.23]No, this shit ain't gonna work.
[294:48.19]It's too big.
[294:58.34]Can I paint the bike?
[295:08.08]Oh, there we go.
[295:08.48]It's working.
[295:19.49]Paint, spray paint your face.
[295:20.94]No.
[295:35.41]This is the Hungarian Radio.
[296:10.50]Empty?
[296:10.86]What?
[296:11.22]I just... A new bumper.
[296:16.73]Definitely.
[296:17.13]Oh, look at this thing.

[296:24.47]The latest news for you.
[296:28.86]AHHHHH- AH!
[296:29.30]The fuck am I doing?
[296:31.34]Disgusting!
[296:32.34]Why?
[297:12.40]This is way too loud.
[297:24.90]We're on 98.4.
[297:48.08]Still no tires.
[297:55.93]Stop.
[297:56.35]What?
[298:03.34]Get it out of my hands.
[298:04.24]Get it off my hands.
[298:05.56]Ew.
[298:06.50]Disgusting.
[298:07.32]Get rid of this.
[298:08.46]Get rid...
[298:26.00]There's more?
[298:26.58]Oh, shit, there is.
[298:29.00]Oh, my God.
[298:30.36]Why is there so much of this?
[298:31.62]I don't want to show that in the vlog.
[298:40.17]This is like MIDI vlog music.
[298:46.51]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[298:47.25]Vlog music, right.
[298:48.33]Okay, hold on.
[298:55.08]Thank you.
[299:26.15]Okay, pay attention.
[299:32.38]The road is gone.
[299:36.18]You're just watching a vlog and this slowly just going way off the fucking road.
[299:40.16]It's like, whoa, dude, somebody should probably pay attention.
[299:51.79]I can't crash like that.
[299:52.85]I know you all want me to, but it would be over at that point.
[299:56.15]I'm not going to start over.
[299:57.19]Get on the road.
[300:12.32]I miss the mirror, don't you?
[300:13.56]I so badly miss the mirror.
[300:15.28]What's blocking this?
[300:39.78]FM 98.4.
[300:42.04]Some weather forecast for you guys.
[300:43.98]Mostly the weather will be sunny, just like my life and yours.
[300:49.16]Let's make it even better with one of my favorite songs.
[300:53.49]Jennifer, hit it.
[300:54.79]The unseen video.
[300:56.07]FM 98.4.
[301:07.49]More mirror jokes.
[301:08.69]I just can't stop.
[301:09.53]I have to look.
[301:10.11]Isn't there an animal that if it sees its reflection, it freezes and just goes, I need to stare at you now.
[301:16.89]Whatever it is, that's me.
[301:17.67]Alright, new radio.
[301:30.92]The same guys on every radio station.
[301:40.12]There we go.
[301:50.23]I would love to find a tire.
[301:51.43]That would be great.
[301:56.88]It's too loud.
[302:09.81]max volume I don't think I want to do that to you guys I feel like that would hurt fine okay I'm gonna I'm gonna that's way too loud I don't like it oh
[302:39.54]Normal level.
[302:59.83]Drive on the road.
[303:00.71]Yeah, I know, but isn't the road probably more dangerous because of random rocks?
[303:05.89]I can see the rocks from a mile away if I drive on the other side.
[303:11.62]louder and floor it.
[303:12.64]This is as fast as this little shitty engine can go.
[303:17.52]It can't go much faster than this.
[303:18.76]Look, you want to see?
[303:28.80]You want to see the engine?
[303:31.26]Look!
[303:32.36]It's not very good.
[303:34.82]It's pretty slow.
[303:35.88]Hold on, like,
[303:44.15]Gotta give it a little more extra coolin'.
[303:57.54]On every station!
[303:58.38]Get outta here!
[304:02.19]Alright.
[304:09.87]If I'm going fast enough, can this start to spray out into my mouth and I can drink it while I'm driving?
[304:15.91]Can I just drink this coolant while I'm driving?
[304:20.59]If it goes fast enough?
[304:21.56]What was the cap?
[304:23.44]Hold on, I got it.
[304:27.88]It is open, you're right.
[304:33.71]Why do I want to do this so bad?
[304:35.37]It's not even funny.
[304:40.74]Wait.
[304:40.96]Goddamn, what a long road trip this is.
[304:43.72]I'm getting so fucking thirsty.
[304:47.98]I got no Gatorade in the car.
[304:54.27]That's empty.
[305:12.71]Desperate times call for desperate measures.
[305:14.48]I can't drink it.
[305:15.44]I'm trying.
[305:44.70]You wanna go back here?
[305:45.67]You wanna be you in the backseat?
[305:51.77]Oh fuck!
[305:54.35]That's a pole!
[305:55.71]Alright, see you in the backseat, guys.
[305:57.99]Are we there yet?
[305:59.01]Are we there yet?
[306:00.15]Shut up!
[306:00.61]Quiet back there!
[306:14.71]We got another 250 miles at least.
[306:16.84]Here.
[306:18.20]Here.
[306:18.54]Drink some gasoline.
[306:20.82]You'll feel better.
[306:24.94]I don't like that.
[306:25.86]It's alright.
[306:26.34]We'll stop somewhere and get some Powerade.
[306:28.24]The purple Powerade is my favorite.
[306:30.19]Want to sing a car song?
[306:31.85]No.
[306:43.94]I spy with my little eye something that is orange.
[306:49.31]Is it the sky?
[306:54.03]You got it.
[306:54.55]That's my son.
[306:55.31]He got it.
[306:55.79]It's the sky and everything else.
[306:58.05]You got it.
[306:59.57]Hey, hey, son, son, son.
[307:02.35]Shh.
[307:03.35]We got him.
[307:04.15]We got him.
[307:04.65]Dad's going to get out of the car for a minute.
[307:06.87]Hang tight right here.
[307:11.52]Just put on your favorite radio We
[307:36.66]With the car idling at volume 10.
[307:40.27]This poor kid.
[307:45.89]Just do F10 for the kids, Cam?
[307:53.23]F4?
[307:53.57]Okay.
[308:00.73]Hey!
[308:03.15]Look at the stupid decisions.
[308:07.06]I'm trying to keep my eye on the road, son.
[308:11.40]Son.
[308:12.40]Yeah?
[308:12.58]We'll be back in a few minutes.
[308:14.74]Just hang tight.
[308:16.52]If you get thirsty, just bring a gasoline in the back seat.
[308:24.13]Don't go anywhere.
[308:31.51]Hey, son.
[308:32.55]Hey, son.
[308:33.19]I found something.
[308:33.95]I found something.
[308:41.19]This is gonna look real good.
[308:45.77]Your favorite color, blue.
[308:48.07]You see it?
[308:50.27]Ooh, I gotta be careful.
[308:53.75]Blue's not my favorite color.
[308:55.97]That's some, what up?
[308:58.27]Oh, I didn't hear you.
[308:58.93]I thought you said blue's my favorite color.
[309:04.97]Hey, you need to hear all that, we'll be right back.
[309:15.62]And look what your dear old dad just found.
[309:18.28]People leave this crazy shit around, son.
[309:22.64]Yellow Powerade.
[309:26.18]What's up?
[309:33.25]Son, we got a problem here.
[309:35.73]Son!
[309:42.06]Turn it on.
[309:47.66]There's a fucking UFO.
[309:59.33]Dad, I didn't see anything.
[310:00.71]What are you talking about?
[310:02.17]You didn't see the UFO fly overhead?
[310:04.81]Dad, I didn't see anything at all.
[310:08.75]Are you sure?
[310:11.61]No, there was food, I think, in that house.
[310:14.63]Food?
[310:14.79]What are you talking about?
[310:15.43]Are you fucking crazy?
[310:17.43]A UFO just flew overhead.
[310:18.57]What are you, dumb?
[310:22.90]I don't want to drink anymore.
[310:24.50]I think you should stop drinking gasoline.
[310:28.22]Gasoline is the most delicious fluid there is.
[310:34.33]Don't move.
[310:35.11]You won't get hurt.
[310:47.34]Okay, we're going back on the road.
[310:48.80]I gotta catch that UFO.
[310:49.64]Look at his hand.
[311:01.18]Rabbit!
[311:04.86]Dad, why did you do that?
[311:17.80]oh hey son did you know your dad could do this oh my god yeah your dad's kind of like beetle juice isn't he
[311:47.96]Can you drop me off at- The sound is piercing my ears.
[311:57.76]I'm missing a tire?
[312:07.23]What?
[312:30.69]A spare.
[312:31.47]Yeah, it's alright.
[312:32.61]Whatever.
[312:32.93]Is it front-wheel drive?
[312:36.31]If it's front-wheel drive, then I'm just taking this off.
[312:53.31]It's rear-wheel drive.
[312:54.37]It's rear-wheel... real-world drive.
[313:08.62]Okay.
[313:09.84]Two rear tires.
[313:13.70]This one kind of looks messed up though, doesn't it?
[313:15.28]What's wrong with the door?
[313:25.63]No, we're good.
[313:26.11]Alright.
[313:26.47]We just need a gas station.
[313:30.03]Hey, Doobie Roller.
[313:30.85]Thanks for 10 community subs, Doobie.
[313:36.12]I'll take them.
[313:36.52]It's 10 subs.
[313:39.01]Thanks, dude.
[313:49.60]Scooby dooby roller.
[313:52.18]Fuck, I'm hungry.
[313:52.76]What about you?
[313:53.10]Alright, I gotta make a decision here.
[313:55.36]Um... I'm gonna say... Hmm...
[314:09.55]Whatever, I can stay there.
[314:14.17]Papa John's?
[314:16.13]No, why would I eat Papa John's?
[314:17.92]Papa John's sits in this weird sort of limbo of pizza places.
[314:26.02]It's not that good to order.
[314:27.81]It's not that bad to care about that you ate it.
[314:31.17]But I don't want it.
[314:39.65]There are much better pizza places that I would eat before Papa John's, so I would never order it.
[314:44.90]That's just a fact.
[314:46.44]That's just how I feel.
[314:48.98]Here's a fact.
[314:50.44]I have never, ever, in my entire life, picked up the telephone and ordered a pizza from Papa John's.
[315:00.12]There's been maybe three or four times where it was just cold sitting out at somebody's Super Bowl party.
[315:07.89]And I had maybe one or two slices.
[315:11.94]I've never ordered it before and I've just eaten it maybe once at a football party game thing.
[315:22.03]How can you judge it then?
[315:23.21]I just don't want it.
[315:24.49]I've had it.
[315:24.93]Look, I just don't want it.
[315:29.82]See, back in Massachusetts, we had Puppaginos.
[315:32.10]Puppaginos was way better than Puppajohns.
[315:33.60]Puppaginos was a thousand times better.
[315:38.81]If you ordered Papa John's instead of Papagino's and you're from New England, oh my god.
[315:43.30]No.
[315:43.92]You wouldn't do that.
[315:44.38]There would be no reason for you to do that.
[315:47.68]So now, since I've moved across country, there's no more Papagino's anywhere, right?
[315:52.02]That's an East Coast kind of New England thing.
[315:54.94]But I'm not going to order Papa John's still because there are other places out here that are better than that.
[315:58.93]Turn on the radio.
[316:02.11]I am the radio.
[316:15.49]Where are the ads?
[316:17.93]Like the mid-roll things that Twitch decided was a great idea?
[316:21.27]I think they deleted them.
[316:21.98]I don't think they exist anymore.
[316:35.37]This car is still going- I haven't even used that much gas either.
[316:40.83]I want B. I want B.
[316:46.35]There you go.
[317:00.59]Press C. I didn't even know this existed.
[317:05.73]It's been 5 hours and 20 minutes.
[317:07.21]I didn't even know you could do this.
[317:29.95]Good save.
[317:30.45]We've been driving on three wheels for five hours.
[317:35.71]No, that just happened like maybe 20 minutes ago.
[317:43.17]We got something over here.
[317:47.19]Yeah, I'm aware that I'm missing a wheel.
[317:48.29]What would you like me to do about it?
[317:49.35]Walk?
[317:56.60]I'll get a wheel right here.
[318:01.66]I see a wheel.
[318:04.64]I see a wheel.
[318:08.39]I see a wheel.
[318:09.27]I see two wheels.
[318:11.55]Oh yeah.
[318:14.33]Yes.
[318:15.83]Yes.
[318:18.66]Take it on there.
[318:20.70]Back in business.
[318:22.70]Alright.
[318:23.04]Alright.
[318:23.24]There's another one here.
[318:23.74]Let's put it on the trailer.
[318:33.27]Thank God.
[318:33.75]At least I can have one.
[318:34.45]Anything else?
[318:42.00]What's this?
[318:42.30]Ammo.
[318:43.66]I don't care.
[318:44.50]I have a thousand.
[318:45.10]I'm going to change it up a little bit here.
[319:07.71]Amy Herman bike?
[319:09.11]Yeah, I think so.
[319:14.59]Cotton candy car.
[319:21.19]Come on, do it!
[319:27.92]I can't believe I'm still playing this, though.
[319:29.34]Like, I really can't.
[319:30.96]Why do I like this so much?
[319:33.12]That didn't even go out the window.
[319:34.08]By the way, that would have stuck to the window.
[319:36.50]As disgusting as that sounds.
[319:38.72]Finally, I can actually move.
[319:47.80]That was not a house, though.
[319:49.04]What's that thing on the right?
[319:57.95]Uh, it's a gas tank.
[320:03.87]No, it's a Minecraft diamond block.
[320:07.42]Why do I think I'm driving so erratically?
[320:08.74]It's worth a lot of fucking money.
[320:22.45]Erotic driving?
[320:25.93]No, erratic.
[320:27.51]See, see, see, see.
[320:29.97]How far back can I go?
[320:40.05]I can't lose the Phoebe Herman bike.
[320:41.45]I refuse.
[320:46.48]It's too- I can see too much.
[320:47.64]You know what I mean?
[320:49.88]Don't you- I feel like I can see way too much.
[321:03.91]I want to ride this so bad.
[321:06.57]Alright, guys.
[321:07.95]Tell me the truth.
[321:09.70]I've got gas and I have gas and oil in here.
[321:13.83]Can I ride this fucking bike?
[321:15.91]If I put two wheels on this, fill it, and then turn it on.
[321:20.67]No.
[321:21.35]You need an engine for it.
[321:22.37]What the hell?
[321:24.41]Can I put my car engine on it?
[321:33.13]No.
[321:35.15]Yes.
[321:37.29]It's not how that works.
[321:43.15]I can, though.
[321:45.77]Oh, why not?
[321:47.97]Let's go.
[321:55.80]Try it?
[321:57.10]At the next pit stop, I will.
[322:08.29]Wrong way.
[322:08.81]No, the things are on the right.
[322:26.00]I can't believe I'm still driving.
[322:27.32]I forgot the kid.
[322:32.09]It's alright.
[322:32.79]He'll put his thumb in the air and some horror movie character will pick him up.
[322:36.35]Oh no, I'm out of control.
[322:46.70]Bad view.
[322:54.04]Look, okay, is he the main character, or am I the main character?
[322:56.92]It's really important, because if he's the main character, he's going to be just fine.
[323:02.18]An eagle will come pick him up, for all that matters, if he's the main character.
[323:13.51]Ow.
[323:14.69]It's okay.
[323:18.35]Sorry, just give me the...
[323:23.82]Fucking bike is gonna be the end.
[323:31.08]Wait.
[323:31.89]I swear to God, I saw your character fly out the windshield.
[323:34.25]Can you cliff it?
[323:34.77]Are you sure?
[323:35.21]Did that actually happen?
[323:44.72]Wait.
[323:56.21]Irma, you can put the car engine in it.
[323:59.33]Better be a one-guy moment or I'm going to be very annoyed.
[324:01.19]Okay.
[324:28.87]Get the, get here.
[324:39.90]Yes.
[324:41.96]Save the game.
[324:42.46]Okay.
[324:48.05]The moped runs on two-stroke fuel as used in the Trabant with a cruising speed of approximately 50.
[324:55.32]To start the moped, climb on by looking at the seat by pressing E. Press I to switch the ignition.
[324:59.62]Press space to lift the stick.
[325:01.10]Hold W. Okay.
[325:06.32]So I need oil and gas in here.
[325:13.21]Oil and gas in there.
[325:16.09]Add oil and fuel.
[325:19.12]Do we even have any oil though?
[325:21.68]Might be in trouble here.
[325:22.38]Okay.
[325:40.75]Do I have oil?
[325:53.77]Need oil.
[325:55.67]That's water in there, isn't it?
[325:57.65]Move this out of the way for a minute.
[325:58.59]I need to look.
[325:58.97]Is this water or oil?
[326:06.10]In the engine.
[326:07.04]Oh!
[326:27.26]How much oil?
[326:27.76]Alright, how much oil?
[326:29.22]4?
[326:29.24]4% or 3%?
[326:36.57]3%.
[326:36.85]That's it.
[326:39.57]Okay, good.
[326:40.31]Now, I'm gonna... Can I put... Alright, hold on.
[326:44.67]Another massive amount of fucking subs just came in.
[326:46.75]Holy shit.
[326:47.37]Another 20 from the chef's corner.
[326:51.05]Thank you, chef's corner.
[326:52.03]That's a shitload of money.
[327:02.33]Alright.
[327:03.09]Is that good?
[327:03.53]This isn't doing anything.
[327:23.50]There's no engine.
[327:24.44]Fuck.
[327:29.83]Look down.
[327:30.83]I know there's no engine.
[327:32.13]I know.
[327:32.49]I know.
[327:32.77]Okay, but... Cap that, please.
[327:37.05]Get back up.
[327:37.81]Stand it up.
[327:41.20]Okay.
[327:46.72]Put the car engine in it.
[327:58.22]Did that work?
[328:10.57]Fuck easy careful I'm gonna put the kickstand up.
[328:18.90]Oh my god, whatever just Why is it such a pain in the ass I can't put the kickstand up while it's I
[329:01.58]You motherfucker!
[329:11.42]Alright, it's ready.
[329:13.65]It's ready, it's ready, it's ready.
[329:25.28]Is it going?
[329:25.66]It still doesn't work.
[329:36.31]It's because I'm pedaling.
[329:40.51]It's just a bicycle.
[329:41.67]This isn't using any gas.
[329:43.83]I'm the energy.
[329:58.31]Old eye.
[329:58.83]See you later, sucker!
[330:19.09]It's so hard to control.
[330:25.30]It's impossible to control.
[330:46.75]Oh, the kickstand!
[330:47.75]No, the kickstand... Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.
[331:01.50]Is that another UFO?
[331:22.98]Oh my fucking god dammit, why does this have to be like this?
[331:27.10]Why does this have to do this?
[331:28.62]Why can't I just sit it up?
[331:43.96]Turn the kickstand on?
[331:44.84]I can!
[331:45.28]Alright, we're good.
[331:55.38]Wrong way.
[332:08.05]Let's move.
[332:09.83]Do a wheelie?
[332:14.12]Probably can.
[332:16.72]No, you can't.
[332:22.20]Why is it two of me?
[332:24.91]Is that two of me?
[332:25.61]Did you see that?
[332:27.63]Why is that two of us on the bike?
[332:28.89]Is this shit out of gas?
[332:42.94]Stop doing that with your hand, man.
[332:53.98]What are you...
[332:59.32]Stop doing that!
[333:11.22]I don't know why he's doing that.
[333:24.13]It's overheating.
[333:47.49]Stop doing that.
[333:57.28]Okay, you done?
[334:03.12]There we go, thank you.
[334:10.87]Stop!
[334:27.77]Radiator, but how do you get a radiator on here?
[334:32.10]This is not how this works Make the gun talk No, what?
[334:56.82]Why didn't you tell me to shoot the engine?
[334:58.26]Are you out of your mind?
[335:00.34]This sucks.
[335:28.03]If I just piss, will it go?
[335:29.07]I think that kind of works.
[335:46.11]No more piss.
[335:48.21]Oh no, this can't be the end.
[335:49.93]Time to walk?
[335:52.91]This goes faster than walking.
[335:56.64]I can't believe there's no radiator.
[335:58.66]How was I supposed to know that?
[336:02.00]Reload to the car?
[336:03.04]No, no, nope.
[336:03.94]I can't.
[336:05.01]I'm just going.
[336:08.85]Don't worry, I'll be fine.
[336:15.50]What's wrong with this guy?
[336:23.77]What's wrong with his body?
[336:26.00]Why is he doing this right now?
[336:55.22]I think that was probably part of the problem, I'll be honest.
[336:58.14]I think that's why that was happening.
[337:00.20]I really do.
[337:04.51]John Arbuckle.
[337:10.71]I don't think it needs a radiator.
[337:11.97]I think that's bullshit.
[337:38.70]It has a hole in it?
[337:41.22]It's got plenty of fuel.
[337:45.84]See?
[337:47.04]No!
[337:47.54]At least I'm not working stretchy anymore.
[337:58.89]Just pedal for a while, wait for it to cool off.
[338:00.63]Alright.
[338:04.47]Desperate times call for desperate measures.
[338:09.93]No, I wanted to kickstand it up.
[338:37.95]It's empty!
[338:38.79]Shit, wait!
[338:45.47]No!
[338:46.68]I so blew it.
[338:48.52]I thought I could pee on it.
[338:50.96]It's okay, there's still a little oil in there.
[339:00.28]Whatever, reload, reload this shit, reload it, whatever.
[339:22.97]Wait, Radiator!
[339:25.19]No, fuck!
[339:26.05]I gotta-
[339:55.10]3%.
[339:55.34]Bingo.
[340:02.96]Okay.
[340:03.76]Radiator.
[340:04.36]Give it to me.
[340:22.29]The engine with Mountain Dew.
[340:24.15]Haha, blast.
[340:25.71]Okay, fuck this.
[340:26.77]I'm done.
[340:27.81]I'm done.
[340:28.33]Get the fuck out of here.
[340:29.31]I'm taking the car.
[340:31.74]I'm done with this shit.
[340:33.34]Put it all back.
[340:34.54]You know what?
[340:35.70]I don't need you anymore, bike.
[340:36.96]Wait, is there oil in there?
[340:37.84]I could use the gas.
[340:46.03]At least I got to ride the bike once.
[341:09.63]No!
[341:09.99]Cluff!
[341:16.24]I just smashed my dick in the car door to death.
[341:28.71]Alright, that's it.
[341:29.41]I'm done.
[341:30.57]That's it.
[341:30.83]It's been about six hours.
[341:32.67]I need to get some food.
[341:33.37]I'm hungry and I need to get up.
[341:36.38]Ay-yi-yi.
[341:42.74]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[341:46.56]Not on this stream.
[341:47.26]I'll be on Kitboga's stream tomorrow.
[341:50.93]This was a lot of fun, though.
[341:53.81]Thanks for sticking around.
[341:58.19]It was very, very good.
[342:03.31]I... Yeah, tomorrow... I will... You know what?
[342:05.65]I'll probably send a tweet out or something.
[342:13.36]I would assume.
[342:18.10]Before I'm, like, on the stream, I'll be like, hey, I'm coming on!
[342:22.06]Just so people don't have to wait around, maybe.
[342:23.38]But it should be a lot of fun.
[342:24.98]I'm looking forward to it.
[342:33.17]New tweet?
[342:33.91]That's right.
[342:40.43]Raid, raid.
[342:40.71]Alright, who are we gonna raid?
[342:44.67]We need somebody we haven't raided.
[342:47.59]I want a new raid.
[342:55.33]Raid yourself.
[343:04.90]Let's see.
[343:05.28]Who's streaming right now?
[343:12.32]Who's streaming that we have not rated in a long time?
[343:16.58]You know who we have not rated in a while?
[343:20.12]Who has shown this channel tons and tons of love over the years?
[343:24.61]It's BoxBox.
[343:27.73]BoxBox raids this channel all the time.
[343:32.11]And they're awesome.
[343:42.90]You're going to do House Flipper VR.
[343:52.08]Yeah, we raided Lemmy last week.
[343:55.05]I want to try to do new raids.
[343:57.49]Instead of raiding the same four people every time.
[344:01.09]We've got to branch out.
[344:02.39]We've got to raid other people.
[344:20.16]Who's this?
[344:23.38]Wait, Wainer?
[344:25.36]Wainer?
[344:26.56]I'd save that one for next time.
[344:28.66]But I did already commit to BoxBox.
[344:31.88]Go say hello.
[344:33.93]They are awesome.
[344:36.51]They're playing Teamfight Tactics.
[344:38.85]Teamfight Tactics.
[344:41.63]Apparently it's a try-hard day for BoxBox.
[344:46.62]rate someone with like 10 viewers you know I okay here's why I don't want to do that because maybe if like they really want if you get like 10,000 people dumped on you it's like okay where do I have my can people gonna hear me is my mic on that's a heart attack yeah I'd rather like warn somebody that that was gonna happen 7k well there was 10 earlier
[345:19.86]Raid, quick, before everybody leaves.
[345:21.06]Oh, we gotta do the credits, though.
[345:24.69]Actually, there was a shitload of people here today.
[345:26.91]Much more than usual, Shell.
[345:27.87]Apparently, I'm having trouble talking.
[345:31.77]Need to get some protein.
[345:33.60]Uh, yeah, I mean, this game is really fun.
[345:37.40]Did I get a clean 100 kilometers?
[345:42.02]I don't have to open this game ever again.
[345:49.76]Holy shit.
[345:50.24]Alright, let's do the credits.
[345:52.52]Thanks for watching, guys.
[345:53.24]I'll see you guys on, I don't know.
[345:56.18]Tomorrow I'll be on Kitboga and then maybe Saturday or Monday.
[346:00.98]We'll see how it goes.
[346:02.08]Keep an eye on the sauce over the next couple of days.
[346:03.54]Let's do the credits, though.
[346:08.76]Here they come.
[346:12.90]Load them up.
[346:15.00]In alphabetical order.
[346:18.40]These are all the subs today, those of you that don't know.
[346:20.65]If you're new to the channel, you might be.
[346:25.95]I do not read subs or most bit messages really at all during the stream.
[346:32.63]I used to do all the bits at the end of a stream, but since I had some medical problems recently, I've canned that indefinitely and probably permanently.
[346:43.12]So a six-hour stream is a six-hour stream.
[346:46.06]And a six-hour stream does not turn into a six-hour stream and then an hour and a half post-stream if I need to get up.
[346:59.77]But I do appreciate it nonetheless.
[347:01.93]This channel gets a ton of support and I still can't believe this many people care.
[347:06.99]Seeing the amount of names that just pop up, it's... It can be overwhelming sometimes.
[347:13.75]So thanks a lot, everybody.
[347:16.83]Don't change your raid commit.
[347:17.99]No, I, I, we're raiding box box.
[347:29.48]Birthday.
[347:29.84]Well, we'll say happy birthday.
[347:30.94]Just say happy birthday to the like next week when we read them.
[347:38.38]You can do a belated happy birthday for a week later.
[347:42.54]Within seven days, a belated birthday.
[347:44.69]That's, that's a happy, that works.
[347:57.30]That's a terrible friend.
[347:58.48]Look, you can't keep track of every single person's birthday.
[348:02.95]So what ends up happening is one of your friends will have a birthday and you'll go, oh, yeah, that's right.
[348:08.97]I knew it was I knew it was in September, but no, it's alright.
[348:12.01]It's been like four or five days.
[348:13.25]It's OK.
[348:14.91]OK, now, if like November rolls around and somebody said, hey, happy birthday, Jeremy, I'd be like, alright, what the fuck are you doing?
[348:21.82]It's unnecessary, man.
[348:26.00]You might as well just say Merry Christmas, too, at that point.
[348:40.55]Foxbox has a follower-only mode for 30 minutes?
[348:43.07]That's perfect.
[348:49.29]Here comes the rain!
[348:58.53]That's kind of funny.
[349:00.89]I committed.
[349:01.91]Look, you can't be like, let's raid this person.
[349:03.69]And then like 10 minutes later be like, just kidding.
[349:05.79]Fuck that.
[349:07.15]No, you make a commitment and you do it.
[349:14.97]I'll see you guys on maybe Saturday, maybe Monday, Saturday, Sunday.
[349:20.11]I don't know.
[349:20.41]You'll see.
[349:22.19]Thanks for watching.
[349:23.63]Take care and go say hello to BoxBox on our behalf.
[349:29.44]Nigga.
