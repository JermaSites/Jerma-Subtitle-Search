[02:01.25]Someone just told me to play Wheelman.
[02:05.70]Dude, I'm not going to play Wheelman.
[02:10.36]We played Wheelman for like 40 minutes and I wanted to throw up in my mouth.
[02:19.01]Anywho, we're going to play Condemned 2 tonight.
[02:23.04]Something we tried to start last week or three or four days ago.
[02:28.94]I have no concept of time.
[02:32.29]But we're actually going to be able to play it tonight.
[02:40.69]Mexican Coke is really good.
[02:44.86]They actually sell that in the stores now.
[02:47.52]I never used to, I don't think.
[02:50.09]Hey, right off the bat, Bloji, thanks for the $1.
[02:52.03]Hi, Gemma.
[02:52.37]There's this girl at my school that I really like, but I'm way too afraid to ask her out even though I think she likes me.
[02:57.34]I want to ask you, can you eat a Kid Cuisine live on stream?
[03:03.56]What?
[03:08.92]What does it have to do with anything?
[03:10.82]Thank you, Bloji, for the $1.
[03:15.11]Psychoblot, thank you for the five bucks.
[03:17.51]Hey, Germo, lost my 16-month sub when my debit details changed.
[03:23.14]I'm subbing at the start of the month.
[03:24.44]Love you.
[03:24.72]Hey, Bull.
[03:26.54]Don't worry about it.
[03:28.30]If you sub, if you re-sub, if you don't ever again, thank you for at least doing it in the first place.
[03:33.70]And if you don't, if you never subbed, thank you for just fucking being here.
[03:36.97]It's alright.
[03:37.59]Thank you.
[03:41.37]Stix, right off the bat to you.
[03:42.31]Thank you, Stix, for the $1.
[03:43.33]Jerma, nice perma.
[03:45.92]Must have took a terma to get it done.
[03:49.20]Now, confirma to me that you affirma that the late streamer catches the worma.
[03:55.34]You're fucking crazy, dude.
[03:58.72]What the fuck?
[04:01.02]And Ace Malace.
[04:02.76]Oh, Ace McLace.
[04:03.74]Thanks for the $1.
[04:04.46]Hey, Jerma, I'm high as shit.
[04:06.76]Better not be illegal.
[04:08.60]It better not be illegal.
[04:09.58]We don't talk about illegal shit on this stream.
[04:11.90]Better not be illegal.
[04:14.91]You better be on a mountain right now.
[04:16.37]You better be fucking talking from the top of a goddamn mountain.
[04:19.75]Not on this stream.
[04:22.45]Alright, let's get started.
[04:23.37]I'm going to move this out of the way.
[04:26.31]Interesting thing to come back to right immediately.
[04:31.70]I do have a PlayStation 3 controller, one that works.
[04:34.76]I've already tested it.
[04:35.70]I'm going to press the X button.
[04:37.80]I'm going to press the start button.
[04:40.20]Do I have a bloody nose?
[04:43.20]Is that for real?
[04:44.16]No?
[04:45.02]Okay, that would have been an interesting start.
[04:48.49]To the stream.
[04:51.91]Alright, pressing start.
[04:52.79]Yes, yes, I agree to the end user license agreement, please.
[04:57.35]So, should I just start the whole thing over again?
[04:59.31]Or, no, this... Alright, let me, like, I'll break down what happens.
[05:04.49]You're like a drunk guy, and in the first game, you are three different people.
[05:11.63]You're this psychiatrist, you're a serial killer, and you're a drunk Batman.
[05:17.67]Second game comes around, Oscar the Grouch bum is looking through the trash.
[05:23.02]He says, follow me, man.
[05:24.60]You follow this guy?
[05:26.10]Crazy people climb the fence.
[05:28.24]Wham!
[05:28.60]Boom!
[05:28.88]Kapow!
[05:29.30]Like the screen that does the Batman comic book kapow symbol.
[05:36.19]And then somebody threw a refrigerator at me.
[05:38.07]No, sorry.
[05:38.77]I'm not going to lie.
[05:39.99]Somebody threw a few TVs at me.
[05:43.25]And that's where we stand.
[05:44.16]And then I figured out I couldn't play the game.
[05:47.24]So let's just go.
[05:48.18]That's my latest save.
[05:51.68]I couldn't throw the item.
[05:54.44]It was like 25 minutes into the game.
[05:57.63]Nothing interesting happened.
[05:58.71]Nothing like crazy happened.
[05:59.71]Don't worry.
[05:59.95]You didn't miss anything And it was not a fridge Ace ace mclace with $1 says I live in Colorado.
[06:13.04]Well, there you go.
[06:13.60]So you're just tall No, what is that whatever I
[06:21.19]Thank you, Ivory, for the $1.00.
[06:23.13]Better not be illegal, says the streamer that trespassed Vinny's house after driving a lawnmower without ID on the side of the highway reserved for emergencies only.
[06:33.07]Good Coca-Cola classic.
[06:34.01]Give him the finger, quick.
[06:35.85]All right, now throw the fucking baton at him.
[06:39.32]I missed.
[06:41.42]At least now I can actually, I can left trigger and I can right trigger.
[06:44.78]This is going to be hard, though.
[06:45.78]You can already tell.
[06:47.20]Analog sticks for the birds.
[06:49.32]Do I have to go down to the dog?
[06:52.06]What was the last thing?
[06:52.66]I had to chase this guy.
[06:54.02]Can I grab the TV?
[06:57.76]I can't.
[06:58.10]No TV grabbing.
[07:00.06]In here?
[07:00.48]Did I already come from here?
[07:01.24]I think I have to go down to the dog.
[07:04.24]I forget.
[07:05.70]Where is he?
[07:06.22]Alright.
[07:07.50]Break my fall.
[07:10.98]Ah, he did.
[07:12.34]You know what?
[07:12.74]He did.
[07:14.04]He actually did.
[07:16.02]And then I broke his neck.
[07:17.95]So we're even.
[07:19.86]That was not nice.
[07:23.33]Uh, what's the jump button?
[07:24.21]Just open gate.
[07:27.93]This framerate is so bad.
[07:32.25]Did another dog spawn?
[07:36.15]What the hell just happened?
[07:36.89]I don't know.
[07:41.96]Oh, console.
[07:43.28]I can already tell you this is gonna be a fucking nightmare.
[07:48.60]I'm going to have so much trouble.
[07:51.64]Check status of health.
[07:52.62]There it is.
[07:54.24]I can sprint with left trigger.
[07:55.46]Watch out for the alien mud people.
[07:59.51]That's fine.
[08:01.61]Gun?
[08:02.45]Not a gun yet.
[08:02.99]We were here before.
[08:07.41]Yeah, the framerate is going to be permanently bad.
[08:09.93]This game never came to PC.
[08:12.65]It was only on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
[08:15.43]There's nothing I can do about it.
[08:17.69]I already threw my weapon.
[08:19.53]There are bricks in this game.
[08:21.75]That is fucking fantastic.
[08:23.05]I have to break the sonic device.
[08:26.81]First shot.
[08:27.81]I'm going to take another brick just in case we have to suck brick.
[08:30.93]You know what I mean?
[08:32.79]Just in case I have to marve somebody.
[08:38.09]Suck brick, kid!
[08:40.49]And then he throws it down and he goes, oh!
[08:42.25]Because he actually almost hits Macaulay Culkin with a brick.
[08:46.14]It's actually pretty... Me and my brother used to rewind that scene over and over again.
[08:50.16]Because he just screams, suck brick, kid!
[08:56.32]And fucking guns it over the building.
[08:59.13]And it actually gets pretty close to hitting Macaulay Culkin, who was a child at the time.
[09:08.56]Uh-oh.
[09:09.55]Where comes the jump scare, I think.
[09:12.63]Oh, that was just pigeons.
[09:15.67]It says door blocked on it.
[09:16.81]Okay.
[09:23.18]I think we're locked in here?
[09:24.72]No?
[09:25.84]So I do... I gotta... Respond.
[09:31.12]I gotta turn the voices up a little bit.
[09:33.92]This is a way... This is too fucked up.
[09:35.41]Hold on, guys.
[09:36.07]Give me one second.
[09:38.52]Don't you feel like this shit's not correct?
[09:42.38]Yeah, this is not correct.
[09:43.48]This has got to be like 100.
[09:44.50]This has got to come down.
[09:47.19]This has got to come up.
[09:50.17]Get this one to 100.
[09:50.61]The voices don't sound well.
[09:54.23]Don't sound correct.
[09:59.26]Alright.
[10:00.58]Find a way into the building and locate Van Horn.
[10:02.38]Van Horn was me from the first game.
[10:06.19]Here we go.
[10:07.69]Perfect opportunity.
[10:08.37]Oh, I'm gonna hit this guy right in the head.
[10:11.07]Do I have any more bricks?
[10:12.19]I have to make this one count.
[10:13.01]He's hiding.
[10:13.57]Can you see his head?
[10:15.19]We have to make this count.
[10:16.05]I gotta hit him right in the head.
[10:18.74]Is that good?
[10:19.12]I don't know.
[10:20.74]Aiming with analog is impossible.
[10:21.94]Right here.
[10:23.12]Right in the head.
[10:24.36]Ten points.
[10:30.50]Fuck.
[10:31.34]Any more bricks?
[10:33.18]There has to be something else I can throw.
[10:38.54]Dammit.
[10:38.98]Oh well.
[10:39.62]I tried.
[10:40.02]Alright, the arc... Wait.
[10:44.25]No.
[10:45.19]Nothing I can do about it.
[10:45.93]I have to go punch this guy in the face.
[10:48.97]I don't know my own strength.
[10:51.67]He's so clearly just standing there, hiding too.
[10:55.41]R3 to kick?
[10:57.90]Well, that's not it.
[11:02.44]This controller is so hard to use.
[11:09.53]What was I thinking?
[11:11.73]I... Guys, don't ever... I was trying to... I was trying to save some fucking money.
[11:24.54]And I bought a third-party, like, GameStuff shit controller.
[11:30.62]It's... These buttons back here are, like, impossible to fucking... Look at where the triggers are.
[11:35.29]They're down here.
[11:37.93]L1 and R1 are up here.
[11:40.33]Look where the analogs are.
[11:44.23]Look, listen to me.
[11:45.07]Listen, this is important.
[11:46.93]A PlayStation 3 controller is $40.
[11:50.93]This was $11.
[11:57.87]It's $40 for a fucking PS3 controller at GameStop.
[12:02.17]Somebody should fucking call a senator over that.
[12:08.95]I'm trying to save money and it's unusable.
[12:13.84]It's a shitty fucking third party like Mad Catz.
[12:17.98]Not even a Mad Catz.
[12:18.96]It doesn't even get to have the moniker of Mad Catz.
[12:23.67]I'm gonna die.
[12:25.21]Why is this guy fucking impossible to kill?
[12:26.85]I've hit this guy like a hundred times.
[12:35.74]And, dude, Mad Catz sucks.
[12:37.86]This is a step below Mad Catz.
[12:48.25]You can use a PS4 controller if you hook it up via USB.
[12:51.20]That's not true, because we had to... Listen.
[12:54.07]For those of you that weren't here last time, I gotta make this point.
[12:56.33]For those of you that weren't here last time, a PlayStation, a DualShock 4 does not work with this game.
[13:01.90]You can't hit L2 or R2.
[13:04.06]So you gotta get a Mad Catz!
[13:11.75]Get the 360 version.
[13:12.95]I don't have a fucking 360!
[13:16.89]You're assuming I have a 360.
[13:18.13]I got my brick back.
[13:27.96]Shit, I don't understand how that goes his face start over I'm just gonna break up don't throw the brick Just hit him in the fucking head with the brick forget about the guy that's hiding.
[13:51.91]I have a weapon now use it I
[13:54.25]He wants me to kick this guy so bad.
[13:55.83]He fucking threw it at me.
[13:59.39]Oh my god.
[14:00.87]That guy learned.
[14:03.99]His AI figured that out.
[14:12.90]Why are you impossible to kill?
[14:16.10]I don't understand.
[14:17.30]Will you please die?
[14:19.60]I actually had to kick him.
[14:20.78]That was part of the event.
[14:27.71]Yeah, it was part of the event.
[14:28.95]That guy was not going to die unless I came.
[14:31.30]God damn it.
[14:36.68]This guy blends in with the wall.
[14:38.22]This guy has accidental fucking camouflage.
[14:49.00]Get the fuck out of here.
[14:54.84]There we go.
[14:55.28]Power- Just give me the- give me the- give me the ski- I fucking missed again.
[15:01.91]I missed again.
[15:04.03]Where is it?
[15:05.91]Where the fuck is it?
[15:10.19]Just kick- just keep kicking him.
[15:16.00]Okay.
[15:17.18]So now that we have a moment.
[15:21.68]I need to, uh... That was way more complicated than it needed to be.
[15:28.88]Okay, and just like that... Full fucking health.
[15:38.26]Uh, full health, yeah, alright.
[15:40.00]Ugh.
[15:41.86]Slime?
[15:45.04]Looks like we're going this way.
[15:47.90]There's a guy in there.
[15:48.60]I think there's a guy sticking out of the mud.
[15:51.89]Yeah, there is a guy sticking out of the mud.
[15:54.29]This is following me.
[15:55.61]It's going to blow something up.
[15:57.21]What is it going to explode?
[15:59.05]Oh, the car.
[16:00.03]Okay, the car.
[16:04.55]Is that lighting up my path?
[16:08.19]Okay.
[16:08.57]Apparently there's a T-Rex over here.
[16:13.87]What the fuck?
[16:17.09]You're already throwing the alien enemies at me?
[16:19.33]Two at a time already?
[16:26.50]GameStop controller.
[16:32.25]Get the fuck out of here.
[16:33.35]Give me a weapon.
[16:33.97]I gotta rip something off a wall.
[16:36.65]Come on.
[16:37.91]Brick.
[16:39.71]Jesus Christ.
[16:42.47]Jesus fucking Christ, dude.
[16:51.47]I think we're severely underestimating.
[16:54.87]How potentially worse this is going to be than the first one.
[17:02.88]Oh my god.
[17:07.56]I have to kick him.
[17:13.70]Come on, come here.
[17:19.28]It's significantly worse.
[17:21.14]Is it really?
[17:23.40]No, I don't believe that.
[17:24.34]Is it actually significantly worse?
[17:35.35]This is like hurting my fucking hands.
[17:42.77]Please just stay down.
[18:01.26]Oh my god.
[18:09.91]I don't... Why did they make this controller?
[18:15.63]Who's the fucking imbecile that made this controller?
[18:19.87]They have to be from fucking preschool.
[18:22.72]How did... You have to be in fucking preschool to make this controller this fucking awful.
[18:32.94]Oh my god.
[18:34.50]Somebody at GameStop smashed their head against a fucking desk and then drew in circles this controller.
[18:42.29]I bought it because a used controller was $40 and this was $11.
[18:45.25]Alright, everybody calm down.
[18:48.75]I'll get over the fact that I'm like driving an airplane right now holding this fucking thing.
[18:52.43]I feel like I'm using a fight stick.
[19:00.30]He's dead now.
[19:00.84]Okay, I'm getting used to it.
[19:03.86]I'm getting used to it.
[19:06.30]Fuck you.
[19:07.20]Just gotta get used to it.
[19:16.33]I'm holding the controller in a different way.
[19:19.37]I'll never taunt.
[19:22.87]This is not the WWF, dude.
[19:25.75]What the fuck are you doing?
[19:28.23]Oh, wait, we can, like, execute it.
[19:30.29]Wait, what happened?
[19:35.65]What do you mean, quiet?
[19:37.87]My mic is quiet?
[19:38.63]I must have fucking pressed a goddamn button.
[19:43.25]Alright.
[19:44.55]Let's try this again.
[19:45.33]Fucking condemn tube.
[19:54.65]It's 21 frames a second with a Mad Catz controller.
[19:57.31]What?
[19:57.69]Am I on drugs right now?
[19:59.23]Like, what the fuck am I doing?
[20:00.33]Alright, let's go like this.
[20:02.39]At least I have a weapon.
[20:07.61]Now I'm too loud.
[20:08.35]No, I'm not.
[20:11.05]I'm not too loud.
[20:13.13]Am I too... Am I loud?
[20:14.27]What did I do?
[20:14.77]No, I...
[20:22.36]Oh, this is the worst.
[20:25.02]Alright, I gotta pick up more of those... puke guys coming out of those... Don't listen, I'm fine.
[20:40.17]Am I?
[20:40.63]Alright, they're gonna spawn behind me now.
[20:44.93]Anybody else?
[20:45.47]Right here.
[20:49.20]Combo?
[20:49.92]Combo somebody?
[20:50.70]Nope.
[20:51.30]We're good.
[20:51.90]Alright.
[20:57.28]Was there no health?
[20:58.26]I don't think there was any health.
[21:04.78]Speaking of mad cats, I, honest to God, like, wish I bought the mad cats keyboard and mouse for console.
[21:13.15]That's a thing, right?
[21:13.93]Am I crazy?
[21:14.89]No, that is a thing.
[21:16.11]I'm certain of it.
[21:22.51]I'm 99% certain that there's a Mad Catz keyboard and mouse.
[21:28.91]How the fuck am I supposed to be going here?
[21:34.22]It's saved.
[21:37.08]Climbing?
[21:46.59]I gotta get up there?
[21:47.81]I think?
[21:49.33]I guess?
[21:52.05]Is it her jump?
[22:04.09]This is so dark.
[22:06.00]I need to turn the fuck- oh my goodness.
[22:07.82]All right, we're gonna have to turn this like to a hundred.
[22:17.85]Oh, that makes it look so bad.
[22:26.91]It should be like a hidden wall.
[22:28.19]Okay, there's a ladder here.
[22:30.37]Right?
[22:32.24]Yes.
[22:34.90]Now it's too bright.
[22:38.60]Let's turn it down a little bit.
[22:40.26]Let's do 60.
[22:45.51]It's too bright.
[22:48.43]I can't breathe.
[22:50.99]Just don't fall.
[22:54.73]I'm going to get wrapped around.
[22:58.98]No, it's okay.
[23:05.26]We're fine.
[23:05.66]Everything's fine.
[23:07.14]Okay.
[23:07.44]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
[23:08.88]Wait, wait, wait a minute.
[23:09.70]Wait a minute.
[23:10.34]In my, in my fucking like fury, I missed a bunch of like big donations.
[23:16.82]So hold on a second.
[23:19.39]Uh, but Bongo Fiesta, thanks to the $5.
[23:23.79]Caligos, thanks for the $10.
[23:26.89]Always love what you put out.
[23:27.89]Easily my favorite person.
[23:28.85]Well, that's a very humbling thing to say.
[23:33.15]I am honored to be your favorite person.
[23:36.09]Thank you, Caligos.
[23:37.77]Turian, thanks for the $5.
[23:38.85]Come on, bro.
[23:39.33]After all that Ben has cheered, you can swing for a real controller.
[23:44.63]I know, but there's a principle there.
[23:47.98]There's a principle in paying $40 for a product that is like 17 years old.
[23:54.62]That was $40 17 years ago.
[23:57.69]Even with inflation, that doesn't make any sense.
[24:03.59]In fact, it doesn't make any sense at all, actually.
[24:08.09]Edgemont, thank you for the $50.
[24:11.04]Go buy yourself an official PS3 controller.
[24:14.26]But, but it's, listen, it's not, it's not the fact that I didn't want to get the, I would have bought it, but I was sitting there in the GameStop just thinking like, fuck these people.
[24:23.51]All right, well, he can't go through either.
[24:30.49]Well, he's figuring it out.
[24:33.15]What the fuck was that?
[24:35.91]Uh, but Edge, thank you so much for the $50, dude.
[24:41.45]No, it's too late now.
[24:42.59]We have to use the unofficial GameStop controller.
[24:49.36]Much appreciated, man.
[24:51.56]Backbiter, also thank you for the $30.
[24:53.02]From Backbiter835.
[24:57.62]And they say, for all that is good and holy, buy a goddamn actual controller.
[25:03.77]Well, now I can buy two.
[25:05.97]Thank you.
[25:11.19]You know, I can't... I can't say I'm particularly, like, happy with the fact that they gave, like... It's not, like, weird, drunk drug addicts.
[25:20.47]It's these aliens at the very beginning of the game.
[25:22.51]This is kind of like Resident Evil.
[25:31.72]Jesus Christ.
[25:34.98]I'm just gonna buy ten GameStop controllers.
[25:38.28]What if I did that?
[25:40.53]How angry would you guys be with me?
[25:45.53]What happened to my weapon?
[25:49.97]And where are the weapons?
[25:52.69]I have yet to see, like, any weapons to use.
[25:54.27]Okay, well, this is not the right way.
[25:59.23]I gotta go down and around.
[26:02.25]This way, right?
[26:06.98]Where's my trash can?
[26:08.00]Where's my locker?
[26:12.99]Wait, there it is.
[26:14.07]There's something.
[26:17.83]My body is a weapon.
[26:23.66]I guess we're going this way.
[26:32.43]Throwing weapons.
[26:33.05]In some cases, throwing weapons can interact with the environment.
[26:35.09]Throw a weapon at the ladder to open it.
[26:37.75]To a ladder cover.
[26:43.09]Didn't miss that one.
[26:44.13]Wait, I can catch that in midair?
[26:45.22]Are you kidding me?
[26:45.66]That's gonna be a fucking highlight reel.
[26:46.81]Watch this.
[27:06.06]Watching a guy do that?
[27:08.12]Watching a guy fucking hit himself in the... I'm gonna throw something up and catch it.
[27:13.20]No, just kidding.
[27:13.96]I'm going to just watch it hit me in the mouth.
[27:19.69]Okay, I'm happy.
[27:22.09]We're getting happy here.
[27:27.27]That's definitely a highlight reel now.
[27:29.25]Alright, Pat.
[27:35.50]Is that it?
[27:37.92]Fuck these, like, Warcraft spawning hive enemies.
[27:47.56]Get the fuck out of here, man.
[27:49.08]Come on, I'm trying to play the real game.
[27:54.81]Really?
[27:57.39]I'm gonna have so much just perception issues.
[28:00.17]I can... I can... Look it.
[28:02.47]I'm gonna... I'm gonna make you a 100% guarantee.
[28:05.30]At some point during this stream, I'm going to get really lost.
[28:08.36]It's going to be really, really annoying.
[28:09.72]I'm going to be cursing the game.
[28:12.54]It's just this really low frame rate and how everything is kind of the same hue and mad cats.
[28:20.66]I'm going to get lost and everyone's going to make fun of me and stuff.
[28:23.40]It's going to happen.
[28:29.62]That means I need extra concentration power.
[28:32.78]Continue looking for Van Horn.
[28:34.14]I would love to do that.
[28:39.32]Alright, typical horror movie.
[28:41.80]The wheelchair moves on its own and then a guy jumps from around this corner.
[28:44.70]Yeah, there he is.
[28:46.18]I don't know.
[28:49.84]The case of the self-moving wheelchair!
[28:51.74]Does every item have to be an electric conduit?
[28:59.13]What is going on here?
[29:03.44]Has there been any weapon that's not this the whole game, so far?
[29:07.37]For the first, like, 20-30 minutes?
[29:15.26]And, you know, you talk shit, and that's when you get a crutch, and... Okay.
[29:20.25]I stand corrected.
[29:21.87]What's on the TV?
[29:28.93]Okay, I'll find it.
[29:30.15]I'll try.
[29:30.45]I will do my best.
[29:31.48]Sometimes my best...
[29:52.51]Use a crutch to play the game.
[29:53.69]Yeah, I can throw the crutch, too.
[29:54.95]That's the, you know... The best part about this game is going to be the fact that any item is throwable.
[30:00.91]That means there's so much potential comedy there.
[30:05.92]And unintentionally, we've already seen it.
[30:08.62]So, we've got Game of the Year status.
[30:10.38]At least... At least a contender.
[30:12.72]In my opinion.
[30:14.86]Pull the lever.
[30:18.78]Is that... What the...
[30:23.82]That guy was a chicken.
[30:25.74]That guy just literally walked over and went... I got full health.
[30:38.58]Hook attack.
[30:39.38]A hook attack will push an enemy back, reducing his ability to quickly counter.
[30:43.66]To perform a hook attack, click L3 and then quickly press L1 or R1.
[30:47.65]Okay, so... Like...
[30:56.67]Round two.
[30:57.15]If it would hit him.
[31:02.37]What is this guy holding?
[31:10.45]I need to practice my hook attack.
[31:13.05]Come here.
[31:13.55]There we go.
[31:23.13]What is he holding?
[31:23.87]It was a brace.
[31:27.98]Oh, man.
[31:28.54]I'm already scared.
[31:35.61]Ooh, see?
[31:36.53]I can raise you that one, buddy.
[31:37.95]Shit.
[31:47.62]Hold on.
[31:48.36]I'll get him.
[31:48.76]God damn it.
[31:56.83]I lost him now.
[31:57.49]Where did he go?
[32:01.27]There he is.
[32:03.89]He's hiding right behind there.
[32:06.47]Here he comes.
[32:07.13]He doesn't even see me.
[32:07.91]Yes, he does.
[32:08.45]Fuck.
[32:17.40]Shit in my fucking face, man.
[32:19.08]God damn it.
[32:22.00]Two fucking imbeciles in a fight.
[32:24.40]Two useless people.
[32:26.65]This is what it's like when two old people fight each other.
[32:35.60]Okay, here we go.
[32:36.96]He thinks he's hidden.
[32:38.40]I'll get him right here.
[32:39.34]This is it.
[32:40.02]This is the one.
[32:41.20]This is it.
[32:42.22]Three, two, one.
[32:44.92]Right in the head.
[32:45.98]Wait, start the counter again.
[32:47.32]Is this in the right place?
[32:48.26]Three, two, one.
[32:54.84]Oh my god.
[32:58.79]And now he's gone.
[33:01.35]That hit every single... I think he took it.
[33:03.67]No, he didn't.
[33:05.11]Dude, that hit every single part of the game besides that guy.
[33:11.45]Just... You can't do it either.
[33:14.95]I have to hit him with this.
[33:30.52]Fucking guess- just forget it.
[33:41.83]I got- got him!
[33:42.51]I got him!
[33:42.85]Oh, I got him on the bounce back.
[33:51.48]I just gave him the balls.
[34:04.00]We can't even... It's just a mess.
[34:07.30]I'm just missing him.
[34:13.02]Oh my god, this is perfect.
[34:15.48]Okay, we can finish him off.
[34:22.76]Just... Alright, get down!
[34:25.76]Why are we still doing this?
[34:31.43]No, don't let him pick that up.
[34:45.70]This game already is just... No, this game already is, like, one of my favorites.
[34:50.07]It's already... It's already, like, in my top five ever made.
[34:54.45]This is above Ocarina of Time.
[34:57.39]Just with that exchange.
[35:03.86]No, let's replace our crunch.
[35:08.24]Alright, where am I going?
[35:12.60]That's gonna change real fast.
[35:17.54]Birds.
[35:18.96]I'm in a wicked giggly mood now, too.
[35:20.90]Like, it's the worst.
[35:23.95]Now I can't be stopped.
[35:34.38]Did anybody hear that?
[35:38.64]There was no... There was no sound there.
[35:41.51]I just want to make sure I don't miss anything.
[35:44.51]That guy can wait.
[35:45.09]I didn't know we were in a silent movie.
[35:53.38]Move out of the way, man.
[35:55.88]Alright, here comes the major cutscene.
[35:57.44]We're going to find out that it was me.
[35:58.90]It was me.
[35:59.18]It was me.
[36:04.98]I need to utilize the poke more, I think.
[36:08.04]That's what's gonna really do me in.
[36:16.04]I really hope there's grenades in this game.
[36:18.60]If you have a throwing mechanic, there's definitely grenades.
[36:22.65]Holy shit, where the fuck did you come from?
[36:27.87]That guy was just holding his hand out.
[36:35.66]In the name of God, dude.
[36:39.38]Destroy all the ceiling sacks.
[36:40.62]See, like this guy's just looking to see.
[36:41.88]He can't see.
[36:45.67]See that?
[36:47.55]Oh my Lord, come on.
[36:51.17]Why?
[36:51.45]I'm gonna die.
[36:52.79]I'm gonna... What?
[36:53.95]What are these?
[36:54.81]What is going on?
[36:55.63]Why am I getting grabbed over and over again?
[37:01.26]That was a Dark Souls room with those stupid jellies on the ceiling.
[37:04.48]Do I need to look up and swing?
[37:07.90]That was three in a row.
[37:08.90]Was it the same guy?
[37:09.82]That might have been the same one.
[37:14.94]Whatever.
[37:18.01]Watch.
[37:19.19]Is there audio this time?
[37:20.03]No.
[37:27.36]So theoretically they should be right here, but it is not.
[37:32.82]Alright, so I need to throw my crutch up into the ceiling.
[37:37.65]That's what I'm understanding here.
[37:41.21]We got three spawns, ceiling sacks.
[37:43.37]There they are.
[37:43.79]Yeah, I told you it's the Dark Souls enemy!
[37:47.30]Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 1, they go and they fall on you and take away so much HP, it's like the worst.
[38:00.28]Okay.
[38:01.56]So there are three sacs.
[38:03.46]Is it one right above me?
[38:04.28]No.
[38:10.89]I missed.
[38:11.69]Okay, can I just swing like that?
[38:15.43]I have a lot of reach, don't I?
[38:22.37]Oh my lord.
[38:31.29]This is not how you take care of this situation.
[38:35.43]That's not... That doesn't work.
[38:38.29]I didn't miss.
[38:38.93]I did not miss.
[38:41.41]Don't tell me I did, because I hit it right in the stomach.
[38:47.22]Optional.
[38:47.94]We're just going to avoid them.
[38:57.08]Any more?
[38:57.40]There's one right there.
[39:01.91]That one broke already.
[39:07.45]Anything else I can throw?
[39:11.69]I'm, like, in the ceiling right now.
[39:15.47]Oh, jeez!
[39:16.01]What the fuck?! !
[39:21.63]Don't get the fuck off of me I'm not missing the prompts.
[39:37.90]I'm hitting L1 and R1 at the same time It's not doing anything.
[39:42.52]I'm not missing the prompts.
[39:43.80]You want me to prove it?
[39:45.12]I'm gonna go prove it right now watch this.
[39:47.32]I'll prove it I'm hitting L1 and R1 at the same time
[39:58.67]Fine.
[39:59.35]Let's prove it.
[40:02.51]Ready?
[40:04.55]Let's go do it.
[40:05.13]I'll show you.
[40:06.17]Make sure you've got my hands on the screen.
[40:07.35]This is L1 and R1.
[40:09.59]You want me to mash them, or you want me to just press them once?
[40:11.10]What do you think, guys?
[40:12.80]Let's do it.
[40:13.28]Ready?
[40:51.60]I just got caught with my pants down.
[41:02.45]You guys just all saw me naked.
[41:05.33]That's what happened.
[41:09.27]I was actually nude in front of everyone right there.
[41:13.90]Just let him grab me and just mash.
[41:16.70]Well, they need to make that more clear.
[41:18.86]And he used to say, MASH!
[41:20.02]MASH!
[41:20.58]MASH!
[41:20.94]Like an old Sega fucking, Sega CD guy should come up and just starts yelling it.
[41:30.00]You know, like those old Sega arcade games where it's like, MASH!
[41:33.62]MASH!
[41:34.66]MASH!
[41:36.74]Okay, here we go.
[41:38.42]Come on in.
[41:39.84]And... Got it.
[41:47.55]Okay.
[41:48.91]Destroy all the sacks in the area.
[41:50.52]I don't want to do that.
[41:54.66]Okay, eat that.
[42:03.10]Alright, I'm out of a weapon.
[42:05.82]I'm out of weapons.
[42:07.18]I don't even know what the guy is.
[42:15.50]Brick.
[42:20.39]Bricks.
[42:21.07]I can just throw them.
[42:24.97]Pick up the brick.
[42:31.74]Oh, this is perfect.
[42:33.14]Unbelievable.
[42:35.26]It's going to work out so successfully.
[42:39.00]Any more in my way that I need to be aware of.
[42:43.20]Not that I can see.
[42:45.84]There's one right there.
[42:50.80]Home run.
[42:51.68]I mean, strikery.
[42:53.36]Home run.
[42:54.46]I thought I just broke the... No, there's one over there.
[42:59.34]Let's go for Hail Marys here.
[43:00.64]Let's see if we can get some.
[43:06.62]How do human beings use analogs for aiming?
[43:08.54]I don't understand.
[43:12.16]Analog aiming was designed... For... I don't know what animal this is for.
[43:22.11]My god, you fucking clearly are not hitting that.
[43:35.42]You know what I mean?
[43:36.22]Like, analog aiming.
[43:37.90]Wouldn't even feed that shit to my dog.
[43:39.38]You know what I mean?
[43:39.86]Like, analog aiming.
[43:40.92]That one down there.
[43:47.90]I should be safe.
[43:49.62]And if I'm not, then whatever.
[43:50.64]I can L1, R1.
[43:58.06]I hear a monster.
[44:01.08]God damn it.
[44:03.52]There's health over there, too.
[44:04.72]I just need to make it over there.
[44:05.66]I just gotta go through the obstacle course.
[44:07.46]There's one more.
[44:08.08]How do I handle this?
[44:10.52]Throw?
[44:11.68]Yeah.
[44:12.70]Easy.
[44:16.74]Pop the zit.
[44:18.30]Give me some health.
[44:18.84]Let's go.
[44:28.58]Of course there is.
[44:38.20]Do I have to go that way?
[44:39.38]I don't think I do.
[44:43.03]Raise your sensitivity and be more... See, my problem I always have with analog is... Like, when I press left, it's like... And it doesn't, like... It's not necessarily 1 to 1.
[44:54.36]It feels more like 0.8 to 1.
[44:58.30]Or, like, 0.9 to 1.
[45:01.50]It's never in the right spot.
[45:03.04]Whenever you turn, you never end up in the correct spot.
[45:05.86]It always seems that way.
[45:06.98]And what is that?
[45:10.83]Pool cue?
[45:11.65]No.
[45:16.38]I'm gonna stay with this.
[45:17.82]I feel like it's more my style.
[45:23.78]Unless we find a locker.
[45:25.66]Then, you know, that's my real style.
[45:28.19]You know.
[45:36.19]We're not going for optional quests.
[45:38.31]I'm just going for the actual quest.
[45:40.23]Which is get out of... This underground worm tunnel.
[45:47.54]Don't you feel like this part of the game should be like four hours in?
[45:56.62]Are we inside my own mind or something?
[45:58.04]Something weird?
[46:03.10]I think I have like a super move too.
[46:04.86]Didn't we learn a super move?
[46:07.82]Something like that.
[46:13.92]What a great visual experience.
[46:17.72]And there it is!
[46:18.58]Yeah!
[46:19.22]That is our first gun!
[46:21.86]A shotgun, to be exact.
[46:27.21]Five shots.
[46:28.11]Is there an aim down sights?
[46:30.81]Nope, that's run.
[46:32.90]Yeah, there is.
[46:33.34]Okay, L1.
[46:34.80]R1 is shoot, I'm gonna assume.
[46:36.24]Does throwing the gun shoot all the bullets at the same time?
[46:40.04]What does throwing the gun do?
[46:42.40]Does it just throw the gun or is it a different key bind for when like a contextual key bind?
[46:48.17]Let's see.
[46:48.95]Double pump?
[46:51.05]No, it just throws the gun.
[47:11.84]Remember you could flip the gun?
[47:13.42]Can I do that in this game too?
[47:21.65]There's a device somewhere.
[47:25.33]I have no idea where it is.
[47:26.65]It's making this already painful experience here.
[47:31.16]Even worse.
[47:31.62]I didn't even see that guy.
[47:35.52]I don't know how I killed him.
[47:38.32]I don't know how I killed him.
[47:43.72]Use ledge.
[47:45.96]Is this an Aliens 3 thing?
[47:48.30]Who is that guy?
[47:55.55]All that to get... ...ricked.
[48:02.37]Oh, we were just fighting outside.
[48:03.53]The whole time.
[48:07.40]Alright.
[48:09.42]I told you, this is like... ...dirty, drunk Batman.
[48:14.53]Suck brick, kid.
[48:18.85]Shoot him, what?
[48:19.29]Let him go.
[48:20.97]Let him go.
[48:43.62]Don't shoot the creepy Baraka enemy.
[48:48.70]I need you to listen to this.
[48:51.91]He found me.
[48:54.15]I don't have much time.
[48:58.11]Ethan trusted you.
[48:58.81]What's canon here?
[49:00.31]Did we kill the guy in the trunk or not kill the guy in the trunk?
[49:04.32]Sir, we have a positive ID.
[49:07.58]Yes, Malcolm Van Horn.
[49:13.23]Okay.
[49:13.65]Yeah.
[49:13.81]You're lucky you don't get bricked.
[49:36.84]Uh, the killer survives either way.
[49:38.40]The plot of this game is... Oh wait, I just read the end of the game!
[49:43.09]Somebody just put the end of the game in chat!
[49:45.65]I just read it.
[49:49.69]Okay, well.
[49:51.42]We all know what happens at the end of, uh, Condemned 2.
[50:00.83]All right, well, there's our police badge.
[50:03.08]Oh, my lord.
[50:04.68]Investigate.
[50:05.18]We didn't even get our investigator stuff.
[50:07.06]Your current chain attack.
[50:08.02]Yeah, I did.
[50:08.84]How do I do the chain thing?
[50:11.82]News reports player responses.
[50:13.90]Sonic emitters, optional objectives.
[50:15.80]All right, fist weapon.
[50:18.44]New upgrade.
[50:19.76]Gives your left fist brass knuckles and a substantial increase in damage.
[50:24.82]Do I have to activate that, or is that just there?
[50:32.23]That was the end of the first one.
[50:33.23]Well, I don't know.
[50:34.18]This is the second game.
[50:36.58]I mean, we beat the first game.
[50:40.22]I didn't know what was canon.
[50:41.30]Because, like, I clearly shot that guy in the head in the end of that game.
[50:46.41]So it's not canon that he dies.
[50:48.31]He lives.
[50:49.81]That's the canon ending.
[50:50.63]Okay.
[50:58.29]Listen, you agreed to help us, but if you wanna crawl back under your cardboard box, that's fine by me.
[51:02.83]Yeah, maybe I will.
[51:06.44]Assault Metal Gear!
[51:07.42]This guy points in your face every time he talks.
[51:29.50]All right.
[51:29.94]So I got sniper level.
[51:31.08]Gives your left fist four sniper rifles.
[51:34.49]Look at that.
[51:34.79]You hold it out and you can aim down each one of those and go boom.
[51:41.51]Or it's another.
[51:42.17]I got a missile launcher.
[51:43.17]I got a fist missile.
[51:45.41]Fist missile.
[51:50.42]Can you tell I'm, like, just fucking reaching?
[51:52.49]Uh-oh, here we go.
[51:53.37]Military ball.
[51:54.33]Response.
[51:55.03]Please, dude.
[51:55.49]Watch out with that shit.
[51:56.57]Not yet.
[52:16.73]Fire on, use R1 to fire.
[52:19.89]I know what's going to happen.
[52:21.91]We already know what the deal is here, guys.
[52:23.76]You know this is what has to happen first.
[52:27.44]It doesn't even matter.
[52:30.88]Nobody can... I just need you to see.
[52:32.88]Rats.
[52:33.06]Alright, where's my ammo refill?
[52:45.39]Come over and shoot rats now.
[52:47.51]Give me my free ammo.
[52:52.59]Cannon.
[52:53.15]I think I actually hit him.
[52:54.19]That's enough.
[52:55.25]Wait, wait, wait.
[52:56.45]I need this.
[52:59.58]I need this.
[53:00.72]I need to shoot.
[53:02.12]I lost it.
[53:02.58]Where is it?
[53:05.40]Somebody has to have ammo, right?
[53:08.88]You don't tell somebody to come practice the gun and then don't give them bullets back.
[53:13.10]Search team.
[53:14.23]Oh my god.
[53:14.93]Okay, well we're gonna have to throw it.
[53:16.67]Where'd the guy go?
[53:17.23]Did he go in the scaffolding?
[53:19.89]I have no idea where he is.
[53:21.15]I'm located on the opposite end of the billboard.
[53:29.71]He's gone, he's dead.
[53:33.34]Okay team, prepare for entry.
[53:34.78]Stand clear of the door.
[53:41.09]Alright, this guy's dead.
[53:43.27]Should I Windex him?
[53:44.15]Oh, there we go.
[53:46.43]Hey.
[53:47.97]SCU lockboxes are scattered throughout the city and are typically filled with medical supplies, ammo, and firearms.
[53:53.55]Most boxes are fitted with satellite transmitters and can easily be found using an SCU-issued GPS.
[54:00.29]Throughout the game, there are SCU lockbox keys that you can acquire to open up said boxes.
[54:08.34]But...
[54:09.61]You know?
[54:10.59]Bang!
[54:11.21]Into the screen.
[54:12.41]First time buy.
[54:15.17]$8.99 gets you $10.
[54:17.26]Only for the next 45 minutes.
[54:18.78]I'm gonna have to buy.
[54:24.22]I don't want to... Fear of being left out.
[54:26.00]I don't want to... I have to buy them.
[54:34.02]I don't like buyer's remorse, man.
[54:35.40]I want to make sure I can get it.
[54:37.08]I can't turn this on.
[54:42.19]I'm supposed to be following this guy, and I'm just not at all.
[54:48.01]I'm glad he needed a cutscene for that one.
[54:50.90]Alright, yeah, he's gonna have like a bite on his neck.
[54:55.44]I am the worst police officer ever.
[54:59.26]I'm like slow.
[55:01.90]I'm not with the team.
[55:03.46]I'm staring at walls.
[55:05.93]How did I make it through Police Academy?
[55:07.65]I don't know how to give a shit about these drug sniffing freaks.
[55:12.15]What do I need to do?
[55:14.47]Fish this guy out?
[55:16.35]How do we get him out?
[55:22.66]I'm going to save ammo here.
[55:23.46]I'm going to bait him.
[55:24.12]Nope, he ran away.
[55:27.48]Are you guys failing to see that weird golem creature that just ran by?
[55:34.96]Oh, meth lab.
[55:36.64]Alright, destroy the meth labs.
[55:41.38]I don't want to shoot this.
[55:44.54]Can I just... Okay, I can destroy it without... I definitely can destroy it without shooting it.
[55:49.04]I think.
[55:49.34]Yeah, I can.
[56:01.61]I'm alive.
[56:08.21]Made it through that one.
[56:10.01]Guys, I don't know.
[56:12.55]I think I might need medical attention.
[56:14.31]You told me to destroy the meth lab.
[56:18.64]Jägermeister is what gives me strength.
[56:23.36]Is this not a heal?
[56:27.94]Again, police officer just drinking on the job.
[56:39.45]Oh wow, I'm being a pain in the ass.
[56:40.75]Alright, you guys take the point.
[56:42.37]I'm gonna be beer guy.
[56:44.33]I'm gonna be drink bottle and throw it guy.
[56:48.99]This is the police.
[56:51.11]Put your fucking hands in the air.
[56:56.48]You're wanted for soliciting.
[57:03.14]No drunk people do that.
[57:04.04]It's a fallacy.
[57:10.01]Well, okay.
[57:20.20]He likes to go to the bathroom a lot.
[57:21.90]That's all I found out.
[57:22.92]Where's my gun?
[57:25.64]Let's throw the toilet.
[57:28.40]What happened to my gun?
[57:32.17]Where's the gun?
[57:32.57]There it is.
[57:38.27]Okay.
[57:42.25]Alright, here we go.
[57:43.07]No, I... No, don't... I don't want the bedpost.
[57:51.89]I don't want that bedpost either.
[57:53.34]I want the shotgun.
[57:57.88]What?
[57:59.48]What are you doing?
[58:02.18]What is this guy doing?
[58:03.40]How the fuck did you see that?
[58:06.46]Well, good police work, man.
[58:12.84]My training wasn't that good.
[58:35.38]I threw the gun over in the corner.
[58:38.14]Oh, fuck me, man.
[58:39.36]I gotta concentrate.
[58:41.68]And I'm getting syringed.
[58:42.68]R2 is like shoot in my brain.
[58:47.79]You know what I'm talking about.
[58:51.05]Right trigger is shoot gun.
[58:53.21]Left trigger is aim.
[58:55.01]It's never L1, R1.
[58:56.69]And now I don't even have the shotgun.
[58:59.34]They took it from me.
[59:00.08]I can't be trusted.
[59:00.86]We're going to turn and I'm going to shoot this guy in the face.
[59:07.56]Can I do it right now?
[59:08.42]Where are his legs?
[59:12.47]Okay, here he is.
[59:16.35]Really?
[59:26.00]How do I reload the shotgun?
[59:29.36]Oh, dear.
[59:30.46]No, I don't want to be left alone.
[59:31.48]I don't want to be left alone.
[59:39.69]I just saw him.
[59:45.75]What's that noise?
[59:47.53]Does one of the bad guys have a gun?
[59:50.36]Is this a police officer?
[59:54.28]Nope, it's not.
[59:56.94]Somebody behind me.
[60:02.08]Oh, okay.
[60:04.43]The elevator lobby should be up ahead.
[60:06.17]Let's go.
[60:10.61]Fuck you!
[60:10.93]Fuck you.
[60:11.41]Oh, there's Trevor again.
[60:13.83]Fuck you!
[60:18.83]You can't run in this game, you really can't.
[60:20.81]Sprinting is terrible.
[60:22.87]Health kit, there you go.
[60:24.07]Am I already at full health?
[60:28.45]Trevor, here he is.
[60:29.82]Oh, what a fucking wonderful game.
[60:41.20]Where do you want me to go?
[60:42.62]Like down here?
[60:43.26]No, okay.
[60:46.62]You do want me to go over here.
[60:53.24]Alright, it's clear.
[60:55.52]No bad guys in this room.
[60:57.53]Come on in, officer.
[61:01.35]I hear him, though.
[61:03.21]Above me?
[61:07.06]What was he watching?
[61:07.72]Let's find out.
[61:11.62]Watch the music.
[61:17.51]There's a granny under the bed.
[61:18.63]Thank you, Abnormality, for the five dollars.
[61:21.51]Hey, pal, here's some bits for the reconstructive hand surgery fund.
[61:24.45]Get better.
[61:25.65]Thank you.
[61:42.73]Googly Gareth, thanks for the $1.
[61:45.17]Hey, man, by the way, don't know if you already know, but if you sprint plus punch, you can bash enemies.
[61:50.10]If you do this to a dazed dude, it knocks him down.
[61:53.24]Well, thank you.
[61:53.78]Appreciate the advice.
[61:56.13]And DubskyDude, thanks for the $1.
[61:57.75]The killer from the first game survives condemned.
[62:00.07]What?
[62:00.25]Why?
[62:01.13]Why?
[62:05.33]It doesn't matter if you shoot him or he shoots himself.
[62:07.61]It doesn't matter.
[62:10.01]That's what I meant when I said contends to his plot is whack.
[62:13.03]I see.
[62:17.13]I didn't even mean to do this, but I think this is the right way to go.
[62:24.17]Which door is he going to go in?
[62:25.75]I don't know.
[62:26.51]Left door?
[62:26.87]Right door?
[62:27.19]I'm going to open them both so I have complete and total preface vision.
[62:33.58]You know what I mean?
[62:35.72]I can see like an eagle you guys know birds can only see out of one eye at a time that's why they turn and look at you they turn they rip their head like here like this is what a bird like you know I've noticed this with a bird like does this like they go like this because they can only see it on one like side they can't see like straight they don't have depth perception so they rip their heads around and look like that birds suck
[63:08.85]Don't walk in front of me like that, man.
[63:10.96]We've reached the elevators.
[63:12.22]Roger that, search team.
[63:13.32]Stand by.
[63:15.12]Okay, Ethan.
[63:15.88]Here we go.
[63:16.40]First time to pull up a device.
[63:18.16]I've uploaded your field kit with what we know so far.
[63:21.08]Now let's get started.
[63:22.78]I love birds.
[63:23.38]I'm just kidding.
[63:23.88]Birds are awesome.
[63:24.50]...suggesting that we may be looking for two bodies, one being Van Horn, the other a Metro police officer.
[63:30.66]Signature overlays indicate that both shots came from the same weapon, a .38 caliber handgun.
[63:36.67]Confirmed animal hater, okay.
[63:38.85]Wait, are they actual dialogue options?
[63:41.51]I guess we have to talk.
[63:46.40]Choice.
[63:46.82]What?
[64:05.98]I was going to just say it again, and like I've already said, I've already made the joke like a hundred fucking times.
[64:13.36]I have to, though, like it's a perfect opportunity.
[64:16.66]Are there any trains still operating in this part of town?
[64:19.58]Yes, Metro Transit Rail still operates in that part of town.
[64:22.56]I'm going to do it.
[64:23.20]No, I'm not.
[64:24.26]Evidence has turned up.
[64:25.06]Nothing can average.
[64:26.46]We're going to check out the rest of this wing before moving on.
[64:28.58]LaRue remained here.
[64:29.82]Mr. Thomas, what was average?
[64:32.07]My responses?
[64:36.60]You take the lead.
[64:37.62]If you find Van Horn, notify me immediately.
[64:40.12]I did a bad job responding, I guess.
[64:42.45]Is that guy alive?
[64:52.15]Oh, we gotta fucking throw us up.
[64:53.89]We have to kill this guy with a throw right across the whole room.
[64:57.75]Okay, here we go.
[65:00.22]On the toilet.
[65:01.50]Anything besides a gun?
[65:03.40]No, we're gonna do it with a gun.
[65:05.56]Right in the fucking head.
[65:12.57]Stay there.
[65:13.07]Don't move.
[65:15.79]I'm still getting this throwing thing down, man.
[65:17.37]Just stay right there.
[65:21.11]Why is that going so high?
[65:24.61]You think you would have, like, moved by now.
[65:29.75]Yeah, just stay there.
[65:31.01]Don't worry.
[65:31.56]I have to aim lower.
[65:38.84]Got him.
[65:40.38]Got him right in the neck.
[65:51.21]Where's the gun?
[65:52.87]Oh.
[66:00.82]First try.
[66:01.32]Yeah, can't even go to the bathroom in peace.
[66:04.90]I wish I could throw a desk at him.
[66:06.12]That would have been so much better.
[66:10.35]I would have laughed so hard if there was a guy in the bathtub.
[66:34.58]Speaking of birds.
[66:36.62]Oh, there's one just in my room.
[66:38.40]He just flew by.
[66:39.20]Holy shit, that was crazy.
[66:42.04]This crazy, like, ostrich just came in here and made all this noise and ran out.
[66:45.84]It was fucked up.
[66:55.27]Why do we have to fight this shit right now?
[66:57.33]There can't be anything else?
[67:05.27]Where is he going?
[67:07.15]Going back to my friend.
[67:07.85]I'm going back to my friend.
[67:09.49]All right.
[67:10.59]You need to be more thorough than that.
[67:14.12]No, I don't.
[67:15.84]You have to come with me.
[67:16.58]That guy was trying to wrap around.
[67:17.78]Here he comes.
[67:23.98]Okay.
[67:24.92]I have a friend.
[67:25.34]Huh?
[67:34.95]What the hell just happened?
[67:39.23]Is he hiding behind the door?
[67:40.39]There he is.
[67:43.91]No, he's tethered.
[67:46.34]You gotta goddamn tether.
[67:51.48]Yeah, alright.
[67:52.02]Well, the guy with the tether, we're gonna shoot him right in the face.
[67:55.96]So, whatever.
[67:57.54]I'm not concerned about it.
[68:02.85]Everybody with the tether dies.
[68:07.01]Don't worry, he'll show up again.
[68:17.39]Where the hell is he going?
[68:18.21]Where did he go?
[68:20.09]Come on, man.
[68:20.67]Where is he?
[68:23.75]Where is he?
[68:24.11]Got him.
[68:25.91]I just have to wait for him to come in.
[68:36.55]And all will be right with the world.
[68:41.92]Where is he?
[68:44.64]Got him.
[68:46.30]It's that easy, folks.
[68:48.04]What else did you have?
[68:49.96]Conduit?
[68:51.29]I hear somebody running.
[68:52.73]Who's running?
[68:53.43]Who is running behind me?
[68:54.29]Who's running?
[68:54.67]You guys all heard that?
[69:12.33]Let's go.
[69:12.95]Just get me out of here.
[69:15.31]Back to the elevators.
[69:16.07]Where the hell were the elevators?
[69:18.99]Down here?
[69:29.74]Give me one more guy in the toilet.
[69:31.08]Make it worth my while.
[69:31.81]Come on.
[69:35.27]Bedpost.
[69:36.89]Oh, we have another TV to listen to.
[69:40.43]No we don't.
[69:40.89]Fuck that.
[69:48.38]Over here?
[69:48.90]Yeah.
[69:49.06]Don't fall.
[69:49.34]Don't fall.
[69:52.34]Get outta here!
[70:12.59]Am I supposed to jump?
[70:16.93]I got it.
[70:19.91]That is a really slick... Yeah, I'm good.
[70:28.73]No, I'm good.
[70:33.78]Oh, the elev- Okay, the elevator falls.
[70:36.80]Uh, that was a last second reaction.
[70:39.80]I did not know that was gonna happen.
[70:43.74]Saving content.
[70:44.68]Get my bedpost.
[70:46.02]So I can feel safe.
[70:51.31]Guys, everybody thought I was going to die.
[70:55.85]Gotta give me at least a little bit of credit sometimes.
[70:58.37]Go to the... Find the main lobby and meet up with Dorland and Leroux.
[71:05.65]Can I open it from this way?
[71:11.82]You know how awesome it would be to hit a long-range hit, long-range throw?
[71:16.74]Such a great feeling.
[71:21.91]Like right now.
[71:25.07]You take one wrong step, man, and I'll bash you.
[71:32.48]Here he comes.
[71:35.86]Who is doing that?
[71:37.92]You.
[71:46.96]Give me a weapon.
[71:47.56]Give me the weapon.
[71:48.00]Give me the weapon.
[71:48.40]Give me the weapon.
[71:48.82]Give it back.
[71:49.50]Give it back.
[71:50.66]Another bedpost.
[71:51.24]Give me the stool.
[71:52.14]Anything.
[71:52.58]Give me anything.
[71:53.78]Anything.
[71:55.66]Spectrometer.
[71:56.36]Your spectrometer can detect and track suspicious sound sources to use.
[72:00.90]Access your tool inventory by pressing and holding square and then select the spectrometer.
[72:05.53]Locate the sound emitter.
[72:07.37]Well, that's going to have to wait for just a minute.
[72:11.73]I need to find something to smash this guy's head in with.
[72:17.50]He just broke glass on me.
[72:18.62]No, I got... I have brass knuckles.
[72:23.84]Get the fuck over there.
[72:25.03]It's just anger.
[72:26.23]There it is.
[72:26.81]Combo meter.
[72:50.33]It just makes him angry.
[72:51.29]All right, come on up.
[72:54.05]It's time to kill him.
[73:01.52]Stupid fucking sonic emitter.
[73:02.92]Get out of my face.
[73:09.28]That's not it.
[73:10.42]Wow.
[73:12.66]Why am I fighting this guy?
[73:13.96]I need an equalizer.
[73:18.29]Door.
[73:19.01]Brick.
[73:21.77]There's another guy in here.
[73:23.63]What?
[73:24.21]Where did this guy come from?
[73:30.74]Now I have to fight another guy.
[73:31.78]What does he have?
[73:35.66]You fucking asshole.
[73:36.76]God damn it.
[73:38.14]I'm gonna die here.
[73:44.58]The game's saved.
[73:45.68]This is not where I want the game to be saved.
[73:48.19]You're the ball bat, ball bat, ball bat, ball bat.
[73:49.67]I don't even know where anybody is.
[73:53.91]I have no clue what the fuck is happening right now.
[73:56.47]There's just humans everywhere.
[73:58.29]Don't they fight each other like in the other game?
[74:03.39]Where am I?
[74:03.73]I'm in the corner.
[74:06.57]Does this guy have a violin?
[74:08.27]That guy was hitting me with a fucking violin.
[74:28.41]Good thing it gives me full health.
[74:30.11]I'm so happy about that.
[74:30.91]I'll give you the bat.
[74:32.17]Don't corner myself.
[74:36.57]Please, God, get me... Please, just make a problem.
[74:51.46]Make it a problem.
[74:53.92]It's currently an issue.
[74:55.14]That guy has a frying pan.
[75:11.92]I said not to get put in the corner again.
[75:14.66]But apparently I'm not gonna listen to my own advice.
[75:17.62]There's a toilet seat.
[75:21.68]Where is this other guy?
[75:26.09]Oh no, put down the toilet seat.
[75:29.41]This guy's gonna play ring toss with my head.
[75:38.39]How did you get a combo after that?
[75:46.05]Why does it play the music?
[75:52.06]Okay.
[75:56.50]I think we're safe.
[75:57.88]Safe enough.
[76:00.00]To move on.
[76:00.64]It's like my character's head is made out of piano strings.
[76:11.60]Just like... I have, like, piano keys for teeth.
[76:25.93]Game of the year.
[76:26.83]Game of the century.
[76:29.73]Bring up your gun and increase your accuracy.
[76:31.79]Your alcohol withdrawals cause jitters, so find and drink small quantities.
[76:35.65]What?
[76:39.19]Now I have to... Yeah, I actually have to drink.
[76:41.98]Otherwise the game gets harder.
[76:45.10]Isn't that the reverse?
[76:47.80]Note that the calming effect of alcohol is temporary.
[76:50.36]Alright.
[76:54.61]Well.
[76:57.77]Interesting.
[77:01.71]Uh, this is a riot gun.
[77:06.23]Sharken does more damage.
[77:07.45]I have access to this, though.
[77:10.52]So, if I need another gun, I can come back.
[77:14.46]Let's do it.
[77:19.97]I hear calamity over here.
[77:22.17]Bricks.
[77:23.91]A supply of bricks.
[77:39.98]I am just not gonna get this, am I?
[77:45.20]What?
[77:45.54]This guy's just shooting a gun.
[77:51.34]How am I gonna compete with this?
[78:13.22]I got him.
[78:16.40]How many more do I have to hit him with?
[78:18.53]Oh, come on!
[78:20.65]Oh my god, I have an endless supply!
[78:24.81]Come on!
[78:32.35]How many bricks does it take to get into this guy's skull and kill him?
[78:35.29]Oh, he's dead, finally.
[78:36.95]No, I want to redo that.
[78:42.58]I can hit that.
[78:43.56]It's just very hard to aim.
[78:45.56]I will hit it.
[78:46.74]Just, everybody just give me the strength that I need.
[78:48.98]A shotgun?
[78:53.10]What did I just get shot by?
[79:01.14]I'm very confused.
[79:12.84]That guy now has a shotgun.
[79:20.30]Why would I throw a gun over there?
[79:23.40]I threw that guy a weapon.
[79:41.04]No, I don't want the fucking toilet seat.
[79:42.81]Get it out of here.
[79:45.87]I don't want the shovel either.
[79:53.11]It's so... It's too hard.
[79:55.35]It's too hard to aim.
[80:08.73]Guys, you don't know the subtleties of shooting at somebody apparently.
[80:19.10]Wait.
[80:19.34]What was that?
[80:21.54]Did that guy just fall?
[80:23.14]God damn it.
[80:24.02]Now we have to go back and watch that too.
[80:26.50]How did I miss that shit?
[80:30.77]That guy just appeared in front of us.
[80:32.27]We have to watch him fall because I have to try to catch him.
[80:35.65]We're doing that one again.
[80:38.00]And guess what we're gonna do?
[80:39.46]Not the brick thing.
[81:00.55]Maybe it was a better idea to stay back there.
[81:05.45]Oh my god, I did it again.
[81:10.34]I actually did it again.
[81:12.07]I tried.
[81:18.65]Fucking R1 is shoot, not L. Oh my lord in heaven.
[81:23.05]Get fucked, dude.
[81:28.53]Got behind.
[81:52.18]Please.
[81:52.50]That's it.
[81:59.62]No, that's not it.
[82:05.95]Finally.
[82:06.51]Okay.
[82:08.24]Alright, alright, wait.
[82:10.20]I wasn't ready.
[82:11.96]Oh my god, I wasn't ready.
[82:13.08]I wasn't ready.
[82:13.92]God, no.
[82:14.80]We're just running up there.
[82:16.56]I'm done.
[82:17.26]No more fucking starting over.
[82:19.08]I'm going up there.
[82:19.94]We're running in as fast as we can.
[82:21.47]And I'm going to watch the guy fucking fall.
[82:23.39]I don't care about the calamity around me.
[82:24.73]I don't give a shit about what happens.
[82:25.97]We're going to just run up and watch the guy fall down.
[82:28.03]And we're going to laugh about the funny man falling from the window.
[82:31.91]Here he comes.
[82:37.25]I guess I didn't trigger it.
[82:38.53]Apparently, apparently I did not trigger it.
[82:44.64]All right, I'm done, I promise.
[82:56.24]Oh, my God.
[83:00.09]It's only triggered when they all are dead.
[83:03.99]And we can't save scum either.
[83:05.41]This is an unsafe scummable game.
[83:21.19]Get that gun out of here.
[83:22.97]Fuck.
[83:29.74]Where is he?
[83:30.84]Alright, fall.
[83:32.62]Wow, that was funny.
[83:35.92]Nice.
[83:38.80]That wasn't fucking even worth it.
[83:39.90]What the hell is going on?
[83:54.21]Alright, well, that's not... I need to get... Oh, it's the spectrometer.
[83:57.31]Okay, that's that thing.
[84:02.82]I'm gonna throw something up at that.
[84:03.94]Alright, well I can put this down.
[84:04.84]Uh, the gun is out of bullets, so I just have to go like this.
[84:08.58]And break the transmitter.
[84:13.09]Maybe I can scare... Ah, the gun is not out of bullets, actually.
[84:16.09]There's plenty of ammo in here.
[84:19.05]What's this?
[84:25.35]Baseball bat.
[84:26.19]Uh... Yeah, forget about the gun.
[84:30.29]Guns are not that effective in these games.
[84:33.29]They're too finite.
[84:42.30]Forensic investigation.
[84:43.32]The goal is to find evidence, decipher clues, and make observations that answer the forensic task.
[84:49.82]To get started, approach the body and press X to study evidence.
[84:55.26]Okay, they make it real easy.
[84:57.26]Examine.
[85:00.64]Pull the pole.
[85:04.14]In this scene, you are asked to find three pieces of evidence that best identify the victim.
[85:08.63]Begin by examining the victim's face.
[85:18.45]Male or female.
[85:20.99]This is an...
[85:23.36]This is not an elderly female.
[85:25.88]This is not... Okay, this is an adult male.
[85:29.54]Adult male.
[85:32.35]Alright.
[85:33.13]Notice that your selection has been added to your evidence list.
[85:35.99]Also note that the number of evidence required has been updated.
[85:38.89]Okay.
[85:45.62]I'll find your second piece of evidence by examining his clothes.
[85:51.04]Um...
[85:52.83]I think this is a police uniform.
[85:54.97]Yep, police uniform.
[86:01.15]A badge on the floor.
[86:02.65]Note that some objects be picked up for closer inspection.
[86:05.24]Okay.
[86:07.40]So, badge on the floor.
[86:14.17]Like you mean that thing.
[86:18.71]This is security badge, 40, police badge, 46.
[86:22.31]What do I get?
[86:27.44]Submitted rows of not continuing investigation.
[86:29.22]Oh, I'm happy about that.
[86:30.98]Perfect.
[86:31.52]Do these choices matter?
[86:35.52]That's a good question.
[86:36.54]I'm not sure.
[86:36.96]Three days.
[86:49.83]There's a bullet wound in his back.
[86:53.33]Cause of death.
[86:54.99]So we have to look over his body.
[87:00.49]Find out what happened.
[87:02.55]Hold on one sec.
[87:05.84]Hold on one sec.
[87:07.00]Okay.
[87:09.62]Note that evidence can be stacked.
[87:10.78]This means that choosing one selection may lead to additional choices.
[87:13.18]Okay.
[87:13.62]So this is obviously... He fell down on a spike.
[87:18.82]Head area, leg, arm, torso area.
[87:23.20]This is a... This is a bullet... This is a gunshot wound.
[87:30.27]And this is the... This is the exit wound.
[87:35.41]No, it's not.
[87:35.77]This is the entry wound.
[87:37.87]I don't know.
[87:38.69]What is that?
[87:41.13]That's the entry wound, right?
[87:42.31]No, that's the exit wound.
[87:49.04]Perfect.
[87:49.48]Has the body been moved?
[87:51.38]UV light.
[87:51.64]I see the UV tool, there it is.
[87:52.53]Let's find the dirty shit all over the ground.
[87:53.75]There we go, he has been moved.
[88:18.21]He was under the bed.
[88:19.03]Okay, the body has been moved.
[88:26.51]Okay, this is blood smear.
[88:29.90]Victim was dragged.
[88:31.50]Wait, victim may have crawled.
[88:32.86]Victim may have crawled.
[88:36.26]No, victim was dragged.
[88:37.14]Because you can see the footprints.
[88:39.12]Submit.
[88:40.43]What?
[88:43.57]What are you talking about?
[88:49.59]Follow the blood trail.
[88:50.49]Alright, they made this a lot more elaborate than the first game.
[88:56.25]He crawled?
[88:56.94]There were clearly footprints in there.
[88:58.36]You saw that footprint.
[88:59.34]That was a full-on footprint.
[89:05.86]Here comes some asshole, too.
[89:08.28]I gotta be ready.
[89:13.74]You can call me a scumbag if you want.
[89:16.67]You can.
[89:17.75]I accept it at this point.
[89:19.93]But I'm turning the brightness up at least five.
[89:24.45]It's too dark.
[89:34.35]You scumbag.
[89:35.61]I feel like this is worse somehow.
[89:41.59]Is that a naked...
[89:53.91]That guy's got the weirdest asshole I've ever seen in my life.
[90:07.72]That dude has an asshole like a bug's mouth.
[90:24.76]And it's just, we're gonna roll right to him.
[90:33.31]That's a spider's mouth.
[90:34.39]That's not a person's butthole.
[90:41.77]I tried the same thing, but it never works.
[90:55.97]Get him.
[90:57.55]Get him.
[90:58.05]Don't let him get the jump on you.
[91:03.95]Don't let him get away.
[91:04.79]Okay, now where am I going?
[91:08.15]Where am I?
[91:09.19]Shit, I lost the trail.
[91:13.35]Gonna have to get the sniffing dog.
[91:18.15]There he is.
[91:21.73]That's this way.
[91:24.21]Decipher blood... Your powers of observation can aid you in a variety of ways.
[91:27.97]Some situations are optional, but for maximum mission points, they all must be accurately completed.
[91:36.20]Decipher blood splatter.
[91:38.42]Uh... UV.
[91:42.04]Blood pattern.
[91:42.88]Alright, very clearly, this is a handprint.
[91:49.53]Inward pattern, outward pattern, random pattern, arcing pattern, cross pattern.
[91:54.01]What do you mean?
[91:54.71]What do you mean by this?
[91:58.24]This is just blood dumped on the ground.
[91:59.90]It's an outward pattern.
[92:03.42]He slipped.
[92:05.08]He climbed to the floor above.
[92:06.66]He dropped from above.
[92:07.98]He walked in circles.
[92:09.24]He dropped to his knees.
[92:15.61]I'm going to say he slipped.
[92:17.43]Yeah, no, he fell down.
[92:18.49]He slipped.
[92:20.60]He dropped from above.
[92:21.70]Perfect.
[92:23.88]Right here.
[92:24.22]You mean literally or figuratively?
[92:25.26]I don't know what you mean by that.
[92:26.88]Colin Dexter.
[92:27.34]Yeah.
[92:46.53]No, Dexter will eat him.
[92:48.27]Dexter eats people.
[92:49.11]Wait, does Dexter eat people in that show?
[92:53.21]I've only seen like one episode, but... Dexter eats people, right?
[92:59.50]The whole point of the show is he tries to pretend like he's a normal person while he's eating people, right?
[93:08.66]Only murder.
[93:09.20]No, no, no.
[93:09.80]He kills them and he eats them.
[93:13.54]I saw an episode once where he was, like, eating a person.
[93:16.88]He had, like, a ham sandwich, but, like, it definitely wasn't a ham sandwich.
[93:19.82]That's what I deducted from the show.
[93:22.44]He had, like, pasta, and he was, like... It was a person's, like, intestines.
[93:25.58]Like, that's what it was, right?
[93:27.36]He wasn't eating, like... He never eats a real food in the show.
[93:29.95]It's a human every time.
[93:32.83]He doesn't eat people.
[93:33.63]He collects blood.
[93:44.28]Obviously not in the right place.
[93:48.78]Hey.
[93:50.30]Get shit on.
[93:52.22]Literally.
[93:52.76]Yep.
[93:58.28]Toilet humor.
[94:02.62]They actually added a mirror.
[94:04.00]That actually works.
[94:10.49]I'm not getting syringed by you.
[94:17.30]He's inside my body and I can't hit him.
[94:26.12]Oh my lord.
[94:26.64]Please.
[94:29.13]I'm stuck in the goddamn corner.
[94:33.13]Why?
[94:38.05]I don't know.
[94:44.08]You guys thought I was just being bad?
[94:45.42]Where the fuck am I right now?
[94:49.23]You thought I was just being terrible at the game, but in fact I was like stuck inside of the game.
[94:55.69]I was on top of him.
[94:56.97]That whole time.
[94:59.37]Even if you don't want to believe me, that's okay.
[95:03.98]That was a long jump.
[95:04.84]Alright, let's keep going.
[95:07.96]This way.
[95:08.68]That door's locked.
[95:09.86]Let's get a brick.
[95:14.70]I really think we're about to get a home alone situation here, guys.
[95:17.70]We made the joke.
[95:19.66]We talked about it.
[95:21.12]I'm actually going to get to do it.
[95:23.68]Come on.
[95:24.10]Let me do it.
[95:26.62]You put these bricks everywhere over here and I can't do the home alone?
[95:29.12]Oh, that's horse shit.
[95:34.40]That's actually horse shit.
[95:35.90]Oh, well.
[95:42.95]We're going to progress over here.
[95:48.52]Rooms 201 to 206, elevators and room... I mean, I don't think it really matters.
[95:52.70]I think there's only one way to go anyways, right?
[96:01.51]I believe there is a gun in here.
[96:04.89]No, there's not.
[96:08.24]Oh, well.
[96:12.44]You get to watch TV, though.
[96:17.33]I have walked where they walk.
[96:19.33]I have taken the bum tour.
[96:21.45]And much of what I have seen can't be fully explained.
[96:25.65]They appear to be rambling madmen, crazy women, all bent on destruction.
[96:29.86]But there is a sense of purpose... I'm not doing this again.
[96:31.72]I'm not doing the eat, paint, eat prank.
[96:34.44]The pilot spirals out of control for the police and fire departments.
[96:38.00]And here I remain at ground zero.
[96:42.92]Stay tuned to City News for further live on the scene reports.
[96:45.76]I'm Tony Rhodes.
[96:48.98]Well, we got a whole lot more information from that.
[96:54.69]You guys do know that we are going to see a guy in a bathtub.
[96:58.39]It's going to happen.
[97:00.33]Eventually, a guy's going to be fucking swimming in a bathtub.
[97:10.41]Uh...
[97:16.16]that works better for me.
[97:17.36]I feel like I'm walking in circles.
[97:30.38]Am I wrong here?
[97:33.92]Hello.
[97:35.35]Yep.
[97:35.51]I don't think he heard me.
[97:38.59]Maybe he did.
[97:39.67]Yes, he did.
[97:49.02]I'm getting GameStop fingers right now.
[97:52.48]I'm literally getting GameStop fingers.
[97:57.72]And the last place I haven't been is over here.
[98:10.91]Guy- Just- No, don't- It's not a big deal.
[98:13.85]Just a naked guy.
[98:16.98]Those random naked guys don't make any sense.
[98:20.15]They just shuffle their feet around.
[98:22.59]And then stab you with syringes.
[98:36.92]Okay, there's a cutscene going on right now.
[98:38.82]I thought I was... Nope, just gonna get thrown at me.
[98:52.26]He's gonna bury it in his head.
[98:56.20]Do you feel it?
[98:58.72]Help.
[98:59.50]This thing's gonna break.
[99:07.73]Of course, it's broken.
[99:12.31]Why are they always so much better?
[99:14.33]They have to be so much better.
[99:15.29]He's gonna do it again.
[99:25.59]Are you dead?
[99:32.23]Alright.
[99:33.01]Holy shit.
[99:38.87]Exit.
[99:39.09]I don't think this is going to do anything for us.
[99:40.73]No, it's not.
[99:42.61]Turn around.
[99:43.25]Run this way.
[99:48.99]Alright, we got evidence.
[99:53.76]Verify the connection.
[99:54.70]Do I have to test his blood?
[99:55.99]Let me verify.
[99:56.67]There's an apron here.
[100:00.55]I don't know if that does anything for me.
[100:02.05]UV light.
[100:08.18]Verify connection to victim found earlier.
[100:13.42]Handprints?
[100:14.50]This guy was crawling around on his hands and knees.
[100:22.75]Verify connection.
[100:25.15]Is there a tooth that I need to examine?
[100:32.47]Rosa.
[100:33.71]I found one of his fucking teeth.
[100:42.67]This is leaving the evidence area, apparently.
[100:47.72]Is it, though?
[100:51.35]I guess it is.
[100:53.15]He got to here.
[101:02.34]How would I be able to connect any of these dots?
[101:04.98]It's apparently right here.
[101:19.01]Okay, baseball hat?
[101:20.61]This is definitely not... This is a policeman's hat.
[101:27.59]Policeman's cap.
[101:31.18]Is there a policeman's vest?
[101:34.36]What is that?
[101:36.68]This is an exit splitter.
[101:37.78]This is an impact splatter.
[101:42.95]It's clearly a ski mask.
[101:44.33]No, this is an impact splatter.
[101:46.81]Good.
[101:51.92]Imagine you thought that was a hard hat.
[101:57.06]You would be a fucking moron.
[102:02.30]It's got some kind of hard hat over here.
[102:10.29]Found him.
[102:12.05]Alright, so what do I need to do?
[102:14.27]GPS.
[102:16.09]What if my address just showed up?
[102:21.53]Oh, shit!
[102:21.95]Can I zoom in?
[102:25.71]Is it going to be one of those cases where it saves all of your photos somewhere?
[102:35.94]I'm going to have to examine this guy and find out how he died.
[102:43.49]Hmm, I wonder.
[102:44.37]Maybe it's the fact that his stomach and intestines and lungs are removed.
[102:51.16]Determine room number.
[102:55.12]Oh, God.
[102:55.64]I have to walk outside and look at the room?
[102:58.80]I have to get outside and look at the room.
[103:01.94]Oh, what room number am I in?
[103:05.04]Sarge, that would be... 1.
[103:06.22]It's like on the ground somewhere over here.
[103:14.24]Wait, there it is.
[103:14.66]Is it 116?
[103:15.12]Or 119? 119.
[103:21.08]161?
[103:21.10]190?
[103:21.12]No, it fell down, so it definitely fell this way.
[103:28.94]So it's 193.
[103:29.28]No, 116.
[103:29.40]No, 119.
[103:29.48]That's 119.
[103:29.66]I think we're in 119.
[103:49.82]one one nine nine one nine one nine nine one nine nobody understands what I'm doing photograph the victim's body and take a digital photo first get into position access camera from tools focus carefully and then take your picture you'll be rated on the clarity of your shot
[104:15.57]Let's get into position here.
[104:18.37]No, that's the light.
[104:20.22]There it is.
[104:27.28]No, I'm not going to do the funny joke where I fuck it up.
[104:29.82]Alright, just focus.
[104:32.74]There it is.
[104:33.14]This is how we die.
[104:34.62]There's your picture.
[104:35.24]I should have taken a picture of his feet.
[104:42.52]Photograph the victim's feet.
[104:43.56]I first thought that's what it was going to say.
[104:49.79]Okay.
[104:50.37]Photograph his face.
[104:52.53]Let's get a good shot here.
[105:03.74]Good work.
[105:09.22]Now we get a cutscene.
[105:09.86]Cool.
[105:10.54]Everybody be quiet and watch.
[105:11.42]Not bad graphics.
[105:12.34]Considering it's a pretty old game.
[105:26.87]Nobody is to examine the body until it has been removed.
[105:31.12]Is that understood?
[105:33.48]Good.
[105:34.26]I'll see to our other problem personally.
[105:37.60]Dormant out.
[105:38.61]I just drank a lot of coke.
[105:40.49]I'm really gassy now.
[105:47.21]God, what a mess.
[105:48.34]I took the entire sternum.
[105:52.80]Wait a minute.
[105:54.34]This is not possible.
[105:55.26]Ethan.
[105:57.06]Ethan.
[105:57.94]You ever notice that people do that shit?
[105:59.96]Why do you have to do that?
[106:01.76]We're going to go over that.
[106:03.40]Okay, so what was on the screen?
[106:07.02]You notice that in every movie, every TV show, every video game?
[106:10.98]They always put their head down and grab.
[106:14.05]You know, they go like this.
[106:15.91]They're doing their daily business and all of a sudden their phone rings.
[106:19.91]And it's wham!
[106:21.39]You know, they like put their head down.
[106:22.53]Ethan!
[106:23.69]Why do you have to do this?
[106:26.37]Can't you just go like this?
[106:27.99]Oh, I got a call.
[106:29.83]Hey, what's up?
[106:31.33]Why do you feel like you can't hear?
[106:34.73]If you can't hear that well, then how terrible are those devices made?
[106:37.73]The manufacturing must be fucking terrible.
[106:39.75]And in like the 30 or 40 years of every like piece of media, no one's come up with a better solution for an in-ear device that doesn't have to be like held in place to hear what the fucking person's saying.
[106:51.76]Like push it in, like get it in there.
[106:54.34]You know what I mean?
[106:54.86]It's not that hard, see?
[106:57.32]I don't, look, when I'm playing a game with these in, I don't have to go like this.
[107:01.66]What happened?
[107:02.96]Gotta watch that cutscene again, man.
[107:04.85]Right, okay.
[107:06.69]See you tomorrow for lunch.
[107:11.89]All right, I got a flapjacket.
[107:13.15]Provides substantial protection from firearm damage, cool.
[107:19.65]Who gives a shit?
[107:21.96]Goddammit, where's our fucking transport?
[107:29.61]Are they carrying this guy?
[107:32.65]They're carrying this guy like a cartoon.
[107:42.86]He's missing.
[107:43.74]Oh.
[107:47.66]One guy has his legs, one guy has his arms.
[107:51.02]They're wheelbowering this guy.
[107:59.57]Motion blur.
[108:01.67]Fuck.
[108:04.59]Time to fight.
[108:10.60]Mm-hmm.
[108:18.60]Everybody in the game has a crazy Gears of War body.
[108:22.42]Yeah, if you don't know what the Gears of War body is, that's you take a normal person and you turn them into a tuna can.
[108:31.69]Everybody is just a bumblebee tuna can.
[108:34.86]Alright, let's go.
[108:37.12]Can I kick him over the edge?
[108:39.66]I just want to... Okay, you can't... He obviously can't go over the edge.
[108:45.28]What is wrong with this guy's face?
[108:47.84]Alright, well, that guy got smart and grabbed a weapon.
[109:08.27]Nice headbutt.
[109:09.36]Alright, they are fighting each other.
[109:10.92]That means I get an opportunity for a brick, right?
[109:12.88]Something?
[109:14.52]A box?
[109:15.02]A brick?
[109:16.38]Anything?
[109:16.98]Nothing around?
[109:17.46]Come on, I'm like the one psycho.
[109:18.64]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[109:19.95]Right here.
[109:20.71]What is it?
[109:22.51]Alright, you won.
[109:39.97]Did I just hit this guy with a nail board, or did I throw a bee at him?
[109:45.80]Like, I got stung by a bee.
[109:46.96]I don't think I can lose this.
[109:51.98]I swatted away a fly.
[109:52.98]Here we go.
[109:53.48]Grab the enemy, throw him off.
[109:54.54]It was not even as fun as I thought it was gonna be.
[110:00.37]What is hitting me?
[110:03.87]Has this guy been throwing bricks the whole time?
[110:10.19]I feel like there's some weird existential shit going on where that was me.
[110:13.63]Doing that.
[110:15.45]30 minutes ago.
[110:18.59]Like I was doing the same exact thing.
[110:25.94]Well.
[110:26.16]Let's make it quick.
[110:29.06]Fucking dick.
[110:39.26]Wait, that means I can do that.
[110:45.96]What?
[110:46.59]Where?
[110:47.67]What happened?
[110:53.77]I think I just backtracked off.
[110:55.13]I did.
[110:56.03]Okay.
[110:58.51]I did not know that was possible.
[110:59.87]I can't believe it!
[111:14.10]too many people here.
[111:15.36]You guys, you're crowding me.
[111:20.23]He's gonna throw.
[111:21.53]They always throw.
[111:22.33]Ah, I knew it.
[111:24.33]I even, and here comes the bricks.
[111:27.05]There's blood on the screen.
[111:33.48]It's causing me problems.
[111:38.88]I got instant a chance.
[111:40.34]Alright, here they come.
[111:43.18]Damn it.
[111:48.05]Don't let him get to the bricks.
[111:49.27]Easy.
[111:51.41]Come on.
[111:52.57]Oh, god.
[111:53.13]Jesus fucking christ.
[112:17.45]Give me the fucking around The bees again It's gonna break It's already broken
[112:57.71]I can fight in vain now, this is great.
[113:01.49]Nice!
[113:02.63]You hit the catcher in the fucking head, that's good.
[113:08.83]It's hard for me to say that it's hard for me to even pay attention to what's happening on the screen.
[113:23.07]Does that make sense?
[113:25.85]None of this makes sense.
[113:34.69]It didn't even fucking do anything.
[113:38.27]It didn't do anything.
[113:39.53]It just exploded on his head.
[113:46.67]I'm so... I'm so concerned about falling off.
[113:53.52]I'm like losing my mind.
[113:56.44]It's too bright.
[113:57.14]I think I figured out the problem.
[113:58.52]It's bright.
[114:01.14]Here comes the guy with the bricks.
[114:08.00]I'm just gonna let this play out for a minute.
[114:09.30]I'll take on the winner.
[114:15.12]Yeah, you!
[114:16.16]You!
[114:16.48]Just wait till I'm ready to fight you.
[114:17.92]I'm gonna just back swing my friend.
[114:22.24]Why can't I just have a bomb drop right here?
[114:24.96]That has to be a grenade, right?
[114:30.45]And nobody's dying.
[114:31.69]Nobody will go down.
[114:34.46]Apparently I can kill them, but they can't kill each other.
[114:37.88]No, no, no, this is the smart guy.
[114:55.98]What?
[114:58.01]Where did you come from?
[114:59.65]That guy did too much damage to himself.
[115:05.16]Is this ever gonna stop?
[115:15.55]A guy just came out of the fire.
[115:20.63]A piece of somebody's body was just removed.
[115:24.33]It was just in the air.
[115:28.10]Now I'm getting attacked for the first time.
[115:36.45]Alright.
[115:37.54]I love when they point.
[115:38.32]That's the best part.
[115:39.50]Man, this guy figured out the bricks.
[115:41.88]See?
[115:42.68]If you figure out the bricks, here comes another guy.
[115:45.00]He's swinging at nothing.
[115:47.02]Inside the house.
[115:48.40]Punching nothing.
[115:55.10]I don't think this ends.
[115:58.08]I really don't think so.
[115:59.31]Are there people fighting inside?
[116:04.95]I don't understand why they're doing this.
[116:08.89]This is just a terrible fucking Royal Rumble.
[116:11.82]Wait, no, no, no, we can grab this guy.
[116:12.94]Alright, where are we gonna take this guy?
[116:15.58]Should I take him inside?
[116:16.42]I'm gonna take this guy inside.
[116:23.54]No, we're not, apparently.
[116:24.84]Oh, no.
[116:26.61]I don't want to walk the plank with this guy.
[116:41.90]The guy slimed into the... Okay, they just needed me to drop him for them to continue their fight.
[116:47.34]They were really concerned about that.
[116:48.96]This is absolutely terrific.
[116:51.20]Did I win?
[116:53.74]I won.
[116:55.44]Okay, it's finally over.
[117:08.09]And I missed it.
[117:09.55]I missed it.
[117:10.03]What happened there?
[117:11.49]Oh my god, I missed it.
[117:12.49]That guy died from the board.
[117:15.71]I don't know how.
[117:17.43]But I missed it.
[117:20.41]And I feel terrible about it.
[117:21.68]Should I rewind?
[117:31.74]We might have to rewind.
[117:34.12]Okay, we might have to rewind because I'm getting my fucking ass kicked.
[117:45.78]Alright, who's gonna win this fight?
[117:46.72]I'm gonna say guy on the... No?
[117:48.16]Okay, guy on the right.
[117:51.12]Oh, no.
[117:52.74]Okay.
[117:53.56]Shit-saving fuck!
[117:55.66]Restart the whole mission.
[118:01.26]Try to get more than one person with the bridge.
[118:04.20]That's a good idea.
[118:05.58]Let's try to get as many people as we can trained on us.
[118:10.87]We need to get at least three or four people to cross that bridge.
[118:17.15]We're good.
[118:19.39]We just have to move around, mosey around a little bit.
[118:21.87]Maybe we can drag somebody into the fire.
[118:25.83]I mean, that's possible, right?
[118:27.37]The guy who makes the wrong move, he goes right into the flames.
[118:37.71]I don't think the NPCs can die from the fire.
[118:41.99]Can I get lit on fire?
[118:43.68]I can get lit on fire.
[118:45.98]That's not fair.
[118:50.44]Here we go.
[118:53.08]I should.
[118:53.68]You know what's funny?
[118:55.28]I think I actually just took too long.
[118:58.56]That's why the game didn't understand what was happening to me.
[119:01.54]It thinks I already left.
[119:09.27]How did we get that to happen last time?
[119:14.54]Honestly, how did that happen?
[119:15.50]There's only two people here now.
[119:18.62]Ah, there we go.
[119:21.86]They just slowly but surely trickle in.
[119:24.06]It really is a royal rumble.
[119:25.00]Every 60 seconds a new contestant comes in.
[119:27.76]Alright, let's try it now.
[119:28.50]Let's give it a go.
[119:31.64]I got like two guys on me.
[119:33.54]I can't even move.
[119:34.28]Anybody gonna follow?
[119:40.76]That guy's tying his shoe.
[119:47.16]Just in case you wanted to know.
[119:49.02]And he despawned.
[119:55.61]You guys suck.
[119:57.59]Not gonna happen.
[120:00.35]Let's take some pictures.
[120:01.59]If he fell off right there, you would have seen a laugh.
[120:04.96]Let's get a good photo.
[120:11.24]Right.
[120:18.71]Catch the brick.
[120:19.53]This is right into the camera lens.
[120:21.93]These have to appear later.
[120:23.03]They have to.
[120:24.87]Catch the brick?
[120:26.69]I can't catch a brick, dude.
[120:28.23]What?
[120:29.19]I'm not gonna be able to catch a brick.
[120:30.39]Alright, here we go.
[120:39.91]I'll try to catch the brick.
[120:41.45]I'll try to catch whatever they throw.
[120:42.59]That can't catch that.
[120:48.17]You can't catch bricks.
[120:51.21]Although they can throw them over here.
[120:53.70]Oh, they smash.
[120:56.24]What the hell is this?
[120:59.96]No.
[121:01.38]Alright, that's it.
[121:02.02]Let's go.
[121:05.64]We had our fun.
[121:09.64]It's still hitting me with bricks.
[121:16.92]He's determined, apparently.
[121:18.08]All right.
[121:18.78]We got evidence?
[121:21.92]Clean this shit up.
[121:22.93]Okay, mom.
[121:29.49]What is... Is somebody in the bathroom?
[121:33.73]Oh, great.
[121:34.25]Not more of this shit.
[121:35.35]Remember from the first game?
[121:36.69]The mannequins that followed you around?
[121:42.37]I don't think I can get in here.
[121:45.50]Am I supposed to be taking a picture or something?
[121:46.84]I mean, that's pretty weird.
[121:50.15]I might as well take a photo of it.
[121:57.79]No.
[122:05.52]We're stuck in Wonderland now.
[122:11.06]We were fucking around so much, I don't even know what the mission is.
[122:17.79]Spectometer?
[122:18.73]Spectrometer?
[122:19.87]What was it?
[122:20.35]50?
[122:20.37]Alright, yeah.
[122:21.31]Spectrometer.
[122:24.79]It's in this room on the wall.
[122:30.60]I can hear it.
[122:33.78]There we go.
[122:34.58]It's in this room.
[122:37.40]There it is.
[122:37.92]Smash.
[122:46.11]You don't pick up dead birds in this one, huh?
[122:48.41]I wonder why that is.
[122:53.25]Now, how do I see my... what my mission is?
[122:57.07]Because I got so lost in the... He was waiting with a brick.
[123:05.11]Well... Good for you, man.
[123:09.75]Again, got sick of my shit and made me leave.
[123:11.55]I don't blame him.
[123:43.41]All right.
[123:45.21]I guess I... Where am I supposed to go from here?
[123:47.53]I would... Oh, there's a meth lab.
[123:51.45]I've got to blow this up.
[123:55.87]Watch out.
[124:01.40]And... Thank you.
[124:03.82]I definitely can get in here.
[124:09.70]There's no way.
[124:10.52]Is it really because the chair is in the way?
[124:13.89]It's not, is it?
[124:19.41]The chair is in the way, isn't it?
[124:21.67]Oh, wowie.
[124:22.89]The chair was actually in the fucking way.
[124:30.77]God, now this is scary.
[124:31.83]Wait, I can take his arm.
[124:33.81]Captain Hook.
[124:37.01]Oh, that was weird.
[124:38.51]Oh, no, not this.
[124:39.63]They already played this trick.
[124:44.37]They did this last game, and it was not cool.
[124:46.49]You're not going to follow me into the bathroom, are you?
[124:51.40]That's just weird.
[124:56.38]They sometimes are enemies, too.
[124:59.52]You know, if you...
[125:01.28]Guys, a very special pro tip if you're scared and you don't know what's happening.
[125:07.18]If you don't look, it's not real.
[125:11.05]Right?
[125:12.67]If I turn around, there's going to be four or five people right in my face.
[125:15.89]If I don't turn around, it's not real.
[125:18.37]I can just keep going.
[125:19.73]Blissful, complete ignorance.
[125:22.01]I'm not going to turn around.
[125:22.80]You know what I'm saying?
[125:26.96]Okay.
[125:37.77]11-18.
[125:48.83]Still haven't turned around.
[125:51.72]Don't come up here.
[125:52.66]Okay.
[125:52.92]Well, I still haven't turned around because I'm not going to see them.
[125:58.14]And there we go.
[126:00.26]No scary things are following me anymore.
[126:06.15]See?
[126:07.93]Get out of the way.
[126:17.77]One chair can seriously blow the whole game.
[126:19.89]I have a gun?
[126:31.28]He's got the same idea.
[126:40.67]Will he fall down?
[126:41.37]Is there a guy?
[126:45.29]How are you so much better at me than throwing?
[126:50.01]I would have caught it.
[126:52.34]I would have caught it.
[126:54.20]I would have caught it.
[126:55.08]Oh my god, I hate myself.
[127:00.98]Do you understand how awesome that would have been?
[127:02.90]I pressed the wrong button.
[127:09.72]I'm so, so, so angry.
[127:13.22]I'll get it.
[127:31.33]Oh my god.
[127:32.21]Just shut this gorilla up.
[127:34.19]There's a guy just making like the gorilla sounds.
[127:42.05]And he's a dog!
[127:52.58]This guy's just made out of a dubstep record.
[128:00.98]They will contact you with further instructions behind you.
[128:05.63]Remember.
[128:07.98]If you don't acknowledge it's there, it's not there.
[128:11.50]Okay, scared him away.
[128:25.09]Eat shit and die.
[128:26.17]Okay, well, nice of you.
[128:32.75]What is going on here?
[128:37.84]Is there a man?
[128:40.26]Here comes another television.
[128:46.33]We have just received breaking news from Tony Rhodes, live above Tracy District.
[128:50.07]We're... I don't want to watch the news.
[128:52.77]I don't want to watch the fucking news.
[129:01.81]These guys are all still fighting out here.
[129:06.02]That guy's gonna get electrocuted.
[129:08.14]I hope he does.
[129:08.82]Please get electrocuted.
[129:10.27]Get hit by this swinging electrical device.
[129:12.13]I didn't hit anybody.
[129:28.46]We can rectify that.
[129:34.67]It went right through their shoulders.
[129:52.63]What am I supposed to be doing out here?
[129:54.25]I don't understand.
[129:56.65]I don't think I'm supposed to be doing anything.
[130:04.58]My last chance is right here.
[130:07.84]Last chance.
[130:10.54]If I get it, I get it.
[130:11.34]If not, I don't.
[130:12.57]But I have to try.
[130:13.85]Come on.
[130:15.75]This guy right here.
[130:18.97]3, 2, 1, action.
[130:23.37]Right in the skull.
[130:24.99]I got him right in the skull.
[130:26.01]I'm the reason why this guy's going to win the fight.
[130:28.52]Hit him directly in his head and I win.
[130:33.46]I...
[130:37.09]These guys are not killable.
[130:41.31]They're just an asset.
[130:42.55]A never-ending fight.
[130:43.43]At least I redeemed myself.
[130:49.34]Can I not go through here?
[130:53.58]Knock the chair out.
[130:58.09]I thought I could pick up the trash bag.
[130:59.45]That would have been so fun.
[131:03.55]How do I get down there, though?
[131:07.83]I can't jump or anything.
[131:18.90]More evidence than I need to examine?
[131:22.18]Maybe?
[131:22.44]No.
[131:29.08]They've really not... Unless... I mean, we're obviously at the beginning of the game, but... I feel like...
[131:35.44]There's a lot less detective work in this one.
[131:42.22]Or at least... I mean, it seems like they're trying to do... The... Guess who?
[131:54.21]Is he old?
[131:56.19]Guess who?
[131:56.69]Does he have a funny red hat?
[132:00.18]Guess who?
[132:01.22]We killed you before and we'll do it again.
[132:10.14]That's telling me there's one of those things around.
[132:12.42]Alright, let's do it.
[132:17.08]Here's my drink.
[132:21.06]Gotta hit him with the detective brick.
[132:28.79]Okay, there's a guy there.
[132:29.89]Didn't even see him.
[132:30.59]That wasn't a x2?
[132:43.28]I don't even know who I hit.
[132:44.98]I think I hit the guy on the right.
[132:52.60]Gimme!
[132:53.20]Gimme!
[132:53.68]Am I taking damage here?
[133:02.07]He's just in a weird spot.
[133:13.63]Alright.
[133:14.23]Where are we taking you?
[133:15.67]How is this an instant kill?
[133:16.55]It's a doorway.
[133:19.73]Oh.
[133:20.55]Holy shit, that was brutal.
[133:23.83]Wow.
[133:25.95]Alright.
[133:29.21]Now I understand what that was.
[133:30.49]Do it over here.
[133:43.76]They're still going.
[133:44.84]Are these guys finally gonna die?
[133:47.16]Use zipline.
[133:47.60]Why am I using this?
[133:49.80]Come on, give me the Captain America shield.
[133:51.60]Ugh, why?
[134:17.67]Climb up top.
[134:18.97]Pick up here.
[134:29.98]All those guys are on fire.
[134:31.02]Did I just get hurt?
[134:36.10]What am I getting hit?
[134:39.06]What's hurting me?
[134:41.57]Is there a way I can zoom and focus?
[134:54.59]It's this guy with bricks.
[134:58.09]He's throwing them at those guys now.
[135:00.91]He's decided to have a new target.
[135:05.67]Fine.
[135:06.73]You want to play that game?
[135:08.05]I can play that game.
[135:10.19]Except he's so much better at tossing.
[135:13.92]He has so much better toss than I do.
[135:18.62]Got it.
[135:19.30]Come on.
[135:22.79]Right in the hand.
[135:31.11]Let's go in the head.
[135:31.97]Come on.
[135:36.10]Why is this more fun than the regular game to me?
[135:38.94]I'm having a great time right now.
[135:43.20]Does that say something about my character?
[135:50.01]That has to say something about my personality, right?
[136:01.64]One more.
[136:05.71]Ah!
[136:06.33]Last one.
[136:06.69]Alright, go, go, just drink.
[136:13.57]I'm out.
[136:15.70]That I have shit aim?
[136:18.28]Alright.
[136:20.44]If I were to hand everybody in this chat this controller and this game and said, hit this guy in the head, none of you would fucking win the million dollars.
[136:32.15]Not one of you.
[136:34.33]None of you would win the fucking five million dollars.
[136:38.23]I do have bricks now.
[136:39.10]I think I have to hit this thing.
[136:43.70]Yeah, I think I have to hit that thing swinging around.
[136:53.70]I mean, they put a pile of bricks here.
[137:07.11]Am I not supposed to be doing this?
[137:18.97]I don't think I need to do this.
[137:22.04]That's what I was thinking, down the broken glass, but there was no prompt for me to go in here.
[137:25.30]Oh, this one.
[137:33.94]Okay, this guy has a gun.
[137:36.24]I'm in deep shit.
[137:39.99]Is there any healing in here?
[137:45.87]Oh my lord.
[137:51.76]I need some health.
[137:59.09]You're so bad with this gun, I can't believe I'm still alive.
[138:02.17]It's unbelievable that I'm still living.
[138:06.37]What the fuck is happening?
[138:20.60]Wow.
[138:22.44]I'm just in shock right now.
[138:29.88]How many bullets do I have?
[138:31.18]I can't even talk.
[138:53.49]Can I have a gun?
[138:56.05]This thing, I can't shoot it anymore.
[139:04.78]Back in here.
[139:08.70]Talking has been disabled.
[139:12.12]Another guy.
[139:15.58]He's a guy.
[139:16.64]Please, do you have a gun?
[139:18.12]Hope you do.
[139:23.81]He has a gun.
[139:25.55]But he's using the gun as a weapon.
[139:26.95]He's not actually shooting that gun.
[139:28.33]It just broke.
[139:36.48]Break his fucking neck, please.
[139:37.74]Does this guy also have a gun in his hand?
[139:53.48]Oh, we're stuck here forever.
[139:55.94]They're gonna infinite spawn.
[140:05.17]We actually are gonna be here forever.
[140:09.03]I can't leave.
[140:13.25]That's a gun.
[140:14.46]That's a gun!
[140:26.49]What is happening?
[140:33.48]Playing video games at like 7 frames a second is just not fucking possible.
[140:42.42]There's no ammo in that gun.
[140:45.16]Oh lord.
[140:47.70]Let's go.
[140:53.37]That's not an oil tanker?
[140:55.09]Jesus!
[141:19.89]Just run past.
[141:21.85]No.
[141:24.15]That's not going to happen.
[141:25.95]I need to wait.
[141:28.34]Can I have that?
[141:29.06]Can I have that?
[141:58.08]I can't get past this guy.
[141:59.30]This guy has to die or move.
[142:00.98]Please, be out of the way now.
[142:05.38]We escaped.
[142:07.04]Why is that guy- Hey!
[142:08.35]What are you doing?
[142:27.63]Well, we can't go that way.
[142:30.21]Now I think I'm gonna have to wrap around.
[142:39.36]Alright.
[142:40.44]I just... Okay, the guy on the left has a gun.
[142:46.26]He doesn't know what to do with it.
[142:52.52]Oh well.
[142:58.12]Come on.
[142:59.06]Well, he's gone.
[143:05.21]He disappeared.
[143:06.41]Interesting.
[143:06.89]Oh, yai.
[143:24.90]I have to concentrate more on this game than, like, fucking any other game I've ever played.
[143:37.50]God.
[143:38.14]I... I want to scream in the guy's face that, like, that made this controller.
[143:43.32]I want to, like, get all the GameStop employees that, like, that made this controller.
[143:50.25]Sit them down and fucking board them.
[143:51.89]And just scream at them.
[143:55.17]Go in with a suit and tie and shit.
[143:57.39]And just lay into him.
[144:01.27]We're gonna do a fucking controller camp here.
[144:07.61]Do you see these?
[144:09.27]This is the triggers down here.
[144:14.82]Look at how I have to play this.
[144:15.82]I have to claw this.
[144:18.98]Like a maniac.
[144:24.78]This is how the game ha- Why- I- Alright, now that there's like over 2,000 people here, the reason why I own this and have this is because it was $11, and it was $40 for a PS3 controller.
[144:42.03]Out of principle, I was like, go fuck yourself, you know what I mean?
[144:44.95]Out of principle.
[144:45.87]You look normal enough, but it's hard to tell sometimes.
[144:50.05]What?
[144:51.03]The Dark Blood, the Metal Kings...
[145:00.28]Look at how close together those are.
[145:15.43]Trying to save $30.
[145:15.95]I understand as a fellow cheap guy, I'm not cheap!
[145:27.37]I just couldn't believe that it was $40 for a PS3 controller.
[145:31.12]It's like $50 for a PS4 controller.
[145:35.38]How much is a DualShock 4 brand new out of the box?
[145:38.16]Somebody look it up.
[145:38.86]I need to know.
[145:40.58]Out of the fucking box, brand new.
[145:44.91]How much is a DualShock 4 for PS4?
[145:46.57]Is it $50? $60?
[145:54.97]Okay, so $60 for a brand new, clean, pristine controller.
[146:01.62]This is a pre-owned, a used PS3 controller.
[146:07.12]DualShock 3 was $40.
[146:08.39]If that don't make you mad, I don't know what will.
[146:16.97]We got our stun gun back.
[146:19.73]How do you use it?
[146:31.67]This game just got real weird for no reason here.
[146:38.34]They probably gave the guy $2 to trade it again.
[146:42.88]I guarantee you they did.
[146:47.48]Oh, by the way, every cutscene so far has been the same cutscene for me.
[147:02.49]I feel like I just hit new game.
[147:03.65]Does that make that noise when you do that?
[147:08.49]Tell me, does it make that noise?
[147:10.87]Tell me you can hear that.
[147:37.50]I need, like, material to do that with.
[147:47.71]Oh, I got it.
[147:48.89]Easy.
[147:49.13]Ready?
[147:49.37]Like, that motherfucker ain't gonna get away alive.
[147:56.85]Sweaty hands.
[147:57.63]I don't have sweaty hands.
[148:03.29]Keep the face cam on?
[148:04.25]I refuse.
[148:09.01]Verify name of the doll factory.
[148:16.28]Walker?
[148:17.56]Walker Doll Factory?
[148:21.96]There it is.
[148:27.44]Facecam or Riot.
[148:28.56]Facecam.
[148:29.52]Fine.
[148:32.14]For like five minutes.
[148:33.28]That's all you get.
[148:33.82]Alright, where are we going?
[148:38.33]The doll factory.
[148:39.97]Pick up these nails.
[148:42.22]Two by four.
[148:50.16]Flashlight is not on.
[148:51.56]Is that a bad guy?
[148:52.40]I thought the guy just had red hair.
[148:59.53]I thought that was the Wendy's girl.
[149:07.21]Why did that not hit him?
[149:11.18]Inform... Is this an enemy?
[149:16.26]I'm very confused.
[149:18.78]What's wrong with this guy?
[149:21.98]Oh, he's okay.
[149:26.52]I get you.
[149:26.92]Alright, a number of tanks in the area.
[149:31.32]That is one, two... You don't lose anything here.
[149:41.93]Make sure I end up with an actual weapon.
[149:46.61]Pick up the rebar.
[149:48.05]You stop doing that.
[149:49.13]It's alright.
[149:54.00]Tankers.
[149:54.72]Form about the number of tanks.
[149:57.04]There's one.
[149:57.62]87A mixing tank.
[150:02.70]Who cares?
[150:03.36]There's a settling tank.
[150:08.45]There's a really bad child's drawing.
[150:11.77]Everybody adores you.
[150:14.71]Really?
[150:16.87]Like on Twitch.tv?
[150:17.53]No, this is a mixing tank.
[150:21.24]This is also a mixing tank.
[150:26.66]This is a... That's a mixing tank, too.
[150:28.82]There's only one more mixing tank.
[150:31.21]It's that one.
[150:35.79]Oh, there's one more over there.
[150:41.40]Did I not get one somewhere?
[150:42.56]Over here?
[150:43.58]1, 2, 3, 4.
[150:43.74]Where's the one I didn't do?
[150:47.88]1, 2, 3, 4.
[150:48.34]Back here, really?
[150:49.76]Uh...
[151:14.70]I think that was a baby.
[151:17.16]That was a little baby.
[151:18.26]There's one over there.
[151:24.55]Come on, study.
[151:25.35]It's tipped over.
[151:25.97]Just go get it.
[151:26.73]Oh, come on, man.
[151:32.36]I can't just take it from up here.
[151:33.50]I have to go all the way back down.
[151:42.91]Yep.
[151:44.49]Can't go that way either.
[151:49.51]Oh, did you guys want me to turn on the face cam?
[151:54.14]Because I'm at like a weird, scary part of the game.
[151:56.32]Is that what this is for?
[151:58.70]There's a bunch of jump scares with babies and dolls and shit.
[152:01.72]That's like why I get it now.
[152:04.18]Alright, you'll get it.
[152:04.98]You can have it.
[152:07.05]I'll give it to you.
[152:13.74]I see four type A tanks and a bunch of other factory stuff.
[152:16.68]You don't even need to pay attention, guys.
[152:17.92]It's not like the factory's mixing facility.
[152:19.78]There's only one way out of there.
[152:21.63]A roll-up door at the far end.
[152:22.65]Pipe branch.
[152:23.17]The panel that opens the door is located on the catwalk above the tanks.
[152:28.49]Let's see.
[152:28.93]Love-a-bubbles.
[152:30.11]Love-a-bubbles.
[152:30.89]Love-able babies.
[152:40.77]Jesus.
[152:43.76]Activate the... Oh, come on.
[152:45.30]You can... You can knock that off.
[152:46.73]Enter the correct padlock number.
[152:48.77]Did I get it?
[153:13.39]Close.
[153:23.79]I should have had it with average.
[153:25.31]Let's just go get it.
[153:32.64]Average.
[153:33.16]Average.
[153:33.42]Can't even guess a password.
[153:34.72]What a fucking loser.
[153:37.90]Alright, where is it?
[153:39.50]Wall in his office.
[153:40.32]Door in the office.
[153:44.49]What does it say?
[153:46.31]Life-size doll.
[153:47.27]Probably using your UV.
[153:54.38]Thanks, Luigi.
[153:56.18]Why would you paint the combination 17, 23, 10?
[153:59.14]Why would you do that on the wall?
[154:10.20]I feel like that's not the smartest, most safe way to store your password.
[154:15.52]I know!
[154:17.06]I'm gonna write all my passwords in invisible ink behind me on my fucking wall!
[154:28.03]That's actually a really good idea.
[154:31.85]That's a really good idea!
[154:36.49]Never mind, that's actually a pretty fucking brilliant idea.
[154:46.32]Oh, by the way.
[154:49.56]Already forgot the password.
[154:50.74]I think it was 17-23-10.
[154:58.85]There he goes.
[155:24.81]Oh, they explode.
[155:33.16]It's a lot weirder than the first game.
[155:35.08]The first game had strange random enemies.
[155:39.21]But now you're putting in these weird supernatural exploding walking children doll things.
[155:47.45]A little on the weird side for me.
[155:54.01]Are they coming up the stairs?
[155:58.04]Fuck, they actually are coming up the stairs, aren't they?
[156:04.46]Don't come all the way.
[156:05.44]Wait, if they explode, then what?
[156:06.72]It's like a... It's a Minecraft creeper.
[156:09.50]I have to get really close to them.
[156:12.85]They go... And then I back away.
[156:16.21]Just like in Minecraft.
[156:17.05]Oh, boy.
[156:23.20]Oh, boy.
[156:24.74]How many are there?
[156:25.76]How many are there?
[156:28.06]Just like Minecraft.
[156:32.98]See?
[156:37.99]Explode?
[156:40.09]No, he didn't go...
[156:54.05]Alright.
[156:55.85]Boom!
[157:00.18]Got it.
[157:01.16]It's not that hard.
[157:05.32]It's actually fairly easy.
[157:12.88]That was a Star Wars sound effect?
[157:16.06]Was it?
[157:19.52]I'm gonna say... Sprinting.
[157:24.73]Sprinting is the best thing to do.
[157:26.31]There's a guy in there.
[157:30.86]There's a baby in there.
[157:31.44]Does it bite me or something?
[157:32.16]What happens if I throw it?
[157:32.94]It's a grenade.
[157:34.10]Okay.
[157:34.32]Baby grenades.
[157:53.65]Can I hold the... Okay, you cannot hold onto them.
[157:57.69]You just throw them.
[158:00.53]Well, that's good to know.
[158:01.33]So I guess I... Can I, like, blow up shit?
[158:03.01]Can I blow this up?
[158:05.41]I'm gonna get myself killed with these, I swear to God.
[158:09.03]Yeah, I guess you can knock things down.
[158:11.31]Alright, let's grab one.
[158:12.87]Let's take it on an adventure.
[158:19.21]This is creepy.
[158:23.42]What is that?
[158:24.78]Stun battery?
[158:25.58]Stun gun battery.
[158:26.26]Okay.
[158:26.46]How do I use a stun gun?
[158:27.84]I never got that tutorial.
[158:31.32]Didn't tell me what to do.
[158:32.22]Ugh.
[158:37.75]I need, like... Somebody has to, like, crack my back.
[158:42.55]Somebody has to, like, step on my back.
[158:46.61]Because it is messed up right now.
[158:48.40]Alright.
[158:49.04]Um... Ventilation system.
[158:54.63]Should I clear this out with a grenade?
[158:55.71]Baby grenade?
[159:00.41]No.
[159:00.57]It was worth a shot.
[159:04.03]Go to a chiropractor.
[159:06.21]I don't know.
[159:06.69]Chiropractors scare the hell out of me.
[159:09.37]Because I see... When people go to the chiropractor... Have you ever watched the chiropractor videos?
[159:14.48]Where they break your neck?
[159:16.52]They snap your neck.
[159:18.06]It's terrifying.
[159:19.42]I don't want somebody to do that to me.
[159:20.56]I feel like they're going to Metal Gear Solid break my neck.
[159:26.41]Alright, up there.
[159:28.37]Can I... I don't think I can get... Can I even get up there?
[159:35.96]How do I get up here?
[159:38.88]Vent?
[159:39.36]Is there a vent in here?
[159:40.24]It said go in the vent!
[159:43.58]Or something like that.
[159:51.97]Down?
[159:52.37]It's not down.
[159:53.01]I can't blow this shit up.
[159:57.15]I didn't blow the stairs up, did I?
[160:01.01]Alright.
[160:03.23]Please get out of the way.
[160:07.03]Can we move the Barbie box out of the way, please?
[160:09.23]Because I can't move.
[160:15.36]Go on.
[160:16.76]Get out of the fucking way.
[160:18.30]Get out of my way.
[160:20.26]Get...
[160:37.01]Just blocking myself in.
[160:55.33]I just made it worse.
[160:56.37]I just actually made it worse.
[161:00.84]Get in there.
[161:02.16]Get in there.
[161:23.65]There's no reason to even go in here.
[161:28.75]Get the fuck out of the way.
[161:35.24]There's the vent.
[161:42.34]Why do boxes have to be made out of concrete in games from like the 2000s and 90s?
[161:47.48]It's like trees in GTA.
[161:58.12]Got it.
[161:58.38]Now there's a fire in here.
[162:03.79]I thought that was a baby.
[162:08.31]I thought that was a huge baby.
[162:11.27]I was about to be terrified.
[162:12.39]Back up into the fire.
[162:17.99]Into the flames, man.
[162:40.93]There he goes, finally, into the fire.
[162:43.26]Can he burn this guy too?
[162:45.48]Chain reaction?
[162:46.06]God damn it.
[162:48.78]Got him, okay.
[162:52.06]Get away from me.
[163:15.77]Let them fight each other?
[163:16.77]I will when one of them stuffs his face into my face.
[163:19.29]Here comes the clown music.
[163:25.99]More babies.
[163:29.83]What do I think?
[163:33.86]Definitely pipe wrench.
[163:34.64]Pipe wrench is deadly.
[163:40.70]I don't ever want to get rid of this.
[163:42.66]Fucking hammer, man.
[163:43.71]Hammer's the best possible melee weapon.
[163:46.37]You got so many options with the melee weapon.
[163:47.93]You got blunt.
[163:49.31]You got thrust.
[163:50.47]You have sharp.
[163:51.65]The reach is just enough.
[163:53.83]You can do it with one hand.
[163:56.31]I will argue a thousand times.
[163:57.63]You know how they did like the warrior, the ultimate warrior thing where they did weapons versus weapons and time periods versus time periods?
[164:06.09]I want them to do one.
[164:07.21]I want them to do one with a fucking samurai.
[164:09.82]Like, 2000 BC samurai and a fat guy construction worker with a hammer.
[164:17.02]Guaranteed.
[164:18.54]The guy with the fucking hammer wins.
[164:20.44]Guaranteed.
[164:23.09]It's a perfect melee weapon.
[164:28.09]I would choose that over anything else.
[164:40.68]All right, minecraft it up, let's go.
[164:44.04]Sing-along party.
[164:45.08]They take a long time to explode.
[164:48.34]I don't like that.
[164:53.67]What happens if I hit them with my sword?
[164:56.11]Not my sword, it's not a sword, it's the superior melee weapon, the hammer.
[165:04.62]What about like a Warhammer?
[165:08.54]No, not the Warcraft copy.
[165:10.34]Not the thing that... I'm not talking about the Warcraft.
[165:16.46]I'm talking about the copied Warcraft Warhammer.
[165:24.42]This is getting bad.
[165:26.56]I need to leave.
[165:28.42]Where do I leave to?
[165:29.00]Door?
[165:29.18]This door doesn't do anything.
[165:40.96]Next time I have a good idea, maybe I should go find Warhammer and ask them what they should do when they come up with a fantasy series.
[165:49.64]Maybe you should go check out Warcraft.com and Warhammer.org.
[165:54.93]Damn, I got this operated, right?
[166:00.45]What does that even mean?
[166:06.54]Operating the crane.
[166:07.50]What does that do?
[166:11.53]I need to pay attention.
[166:15.19]There was a... Where's my hammer?
[166:18.15]I lost my fucking hammer.
[166:19.23]I don't want a piece of wood.
[166:24.04]Okay, if you hit them, they explode.
[166:28.06]Could have seen that coming from a mile away, and apparently I did not.
[166:34.62]He's already in here.
[166:48.11]Obviously, this has to be turned off.
[166:50.33]Didn't I just turn it off?
[166:51.61]Or is it, like, timed?
[166:52.47]I think the music is closed.
[166:57.98]This is... Alright, what's the fun rollercoaster?
[167:05.92]There it goes.
[167:10.04]Hey.
[167:10.96]Hey.
[167:12.10]Excuse me.
[167:17.37]So I gotta time this.
[167:19.61]Someone's gonna crawl out of that hole.
[167:20.95]But I gotta walk across right when this goes by.
[167:22.85]I've played video games before.
[167:26.03]I don't think I've ever known what to do in a situation like that.
[167:28.86]Oh, God.
[167:34.32]Okay, well, I'm gonna go like this and just throw one in there.
[167:36.48]Because fuck this, I'm not gonna... There's one right next to me!
[167:47.19]Did that do anything?
[167:47.79]Too nerve-wracking.
[168:02.85]Where are the criminals?
[168:05.09]I want to play against the criminals.
[168:06.77]I don't want to play against like the deranged mutant explosive babies.
[168:17.58]Anyways, um... What did he just grab?
[168:25.33]Where did that guy go?
[168:32.33]He's right there.
[168:40.82]That didn't kill him.
[168:42.08]That didn't even hurt him.
[168:45.92]Was he not close enough to the explosion?
[169:00.75]Come on.
[169:04.69]Give me your stuff.
[169:07.16]What is this game?
[169:07.96]This is Condemned 2.
[169:10.64]Not to be confused with Condemned 1, which so far...
[169:15.35]So far I feel like it's a better game.
[169:16.55]No, I did not watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure yet.
[169:21.43]Not yet.
[169:45.05]What is happening right now?
[169:46.13]And why am I on fire?
[169:48.59]And why am I going to lose right now?
[169:55.75]This cast can be moved, right?
[169:56.87]No?
[169:57.13]I can't turn that?
[170:02.37]I knew you could, but it might have given me the prompt earlier.
[170:06.01]Wait, is somebody in here?
[170:07.85]There was somebody!
[170:11.92]No, there wasn't, but what?
[170:22.66]Fuck.
[170:23.42]Fuck.
[170:25.34]Dude, he's taunting.
[170:26.26]Get the bat.
[170:30.28]He ducked.
[170:30.62]That was... That was pretty clutch, I'm not gonna lie.
[170:40.75]That was actually, like, kind of a clutch moment for me.
[170:47.67]It's a good thing that guy got cocky.
[170:49.61]Otherwise, there's no way I would not...
[171:00.90]I hear coughing, which means none of those crazy guys fire crazy man.
[171:08.67]Man, they just dialed this game up to a thousand.
[171:12.97]It's just dialed up to fucking ten grand.
[171:18.79]Now let's pre-fire.
[171:21.49]Yes we can.
[171:26.45]Fucking idiot.
[171:30.35]It was a dud.
[171:35.43]Was it actually a dud?
[171:36.21]Did it explode?
[171:37.47]I don't think.
[171:42.42]Where?
[171:42.64]I need a gas mask.
[172:00.55]But you can't explode that guy if you're curious.
[172:06.73]Gas mask.
[172:09.51]Gas mask in there?
[172:10.27]This is gonna get the bad ending.
[172:23.72]No gas mask.
[172:26.50]Safety foreman.
[172:29.26]I can get in here, right?
[172:30.50]Look at this shit.
[172:31.62]I can.
[172:32.00]Just to cause a problem.
[172:40.16]That's why they're there.
[172:41.23]Well, they made it really easy.
[172:44.61]Masks.
[172:58.76]Oh, sorry.
[172:59.58]Nothing in there.
[173:00.92]Cool, cute.
[173:01.35]Nothing in there.
[173:02.27]May have broke the game.
[173:26.06]I actually, there's potential here that I may have fucked up the game.
[173:31.73]There's probably dialogue here that I did not, that we're not seeing.
[173:55.55]I guess there is no dialogue there.
[173:57.71]So where's the mask?
[174:07.06]I can't go out that way.
[174:07.86]I'm going to burn if I go out that door.
[174:12.52]Anything on this table?
[174:15.62]No.
[174:26.81]Get the fuck out of the way, you dumb boxes.
[174:31.22]It's the other desk?
[174:38.97]I found a mask!
[174:40.71]I'm so sorry, everyone's yawning now.
[175:04.36]Right when I yawn, apparently that happens.
[175:08.12]Where is it?
[175:08.80]Where am I?
[175:16.05]I'm not in the very beginning, am I?
[175:17.35]Oh, give me a break.
[175:20.46]We're running through.
[175:31.10]This is a bad idea.
[175:32.50]This is a really bad idea.
[175:34.43]Not one of my better ideas, I'll say How do I use the stun gun?
[176:00.97]up why am I yawning god damn it I'm sorry I shouldn't be yawning this much am I really this tired right now remember the idea that I had what idea oh right I've been getting up early though that's the thing I don't know why I've been getting up so early I hate it I hate waking up early
[176:34.04]Bomb rush combo.
[176:35.12]Watch out for the baby.
[176:39.38]Come on, get him.
[176:40.06]Come on.
[176:43.18]These guys don't take explosion damage.
[176:47.47]In any other video game, that guy pops up like he was a colonel into the air and flops down on his back.
[176:54.03]In every video game I've ever played.
[176:57.55]Got him.
[177:04.88]text here.
[177:06.22]Go on.
[177:07.42]Grrrr!
[177:08.40]Grrrr!
[177:39.53]Okay.
[177:45.07]Up the stairs.
[177:45.91]Watch out for the crazy guy with the... I gotta put the ski mask on and be fine.
[177:50.07]Watch out.
[177:52.40]Help me.
[177:52.88]Look.
[177:53.14]Help.
[177:53.42]I know.
[177:53.74]I understand.
[177:54.32]I gotta go around this way.
[177:56.82]Blow this up and we can get in there.
[177:59.54]No problem.
[178:00.62]I fucked it up.
[178:01.20]It's okay.
[178:06.54]I'm here.
[178:07.74]What desk is it in?
[178:08.56]What if I get it right the first time?
[178:09.88]Does dialogue change?
[178:14.63]There it is.
[178:17.13]Thanks for the help.
[178:19.32]Forgot about this guy.
[178:19.96]Forgot about this guy.
[178:20.56]What do I do about this guy?
[178:21.78]How do I stop this guy?
[178:23.14]How do I stop this guy?
[178:34.58]I didn't have a fucking weapon out.
[178:48.89]Short term memory loss.
[178:51.93]Mixed with sleep, mixed with... No, no, no excuses.
[178:55.49]We're not giving excuses.
[178:57.17]We're just gonna get it done.
[179:02.69]Here comes the lady.
[179:04.81]Watch out, lady.
[179:06.06]Now I'm panicking again, and it... I'm so, like, just irrationally upset at the moment.
[179:23.29]How do I get rid of this guy?
[179:24.19]Let's put his head in the TV.
[179:29.67]That's not what I wanted, but it's okay.
[179:33.37]First crazy guy.
[179:35.65]Here it comes.
[179:40.25]Shocked him.
[179:40.63]Let me do that again to this guy.
[179:45.97]I can only do that one more time.
[179:47.24]That is reserved.
[179:48.20]Absolutely reserved.
[179:51.54]For the guy that's running into the room.
[179:55.56]What does he got?
[179:58.26]Anything?
[179:59.78]He didn't have anything on you?
[180:03.79]No bullshit.
[180:04.93]No messing around.
[180:05.75]Okay.
[180:10.31]I like this.
[180:10.85]Yeah, I've been waking up at like 5 a.m.
[180:17.83]I've been going to sleep really, really early and waking up at like 5.
[180:22.85]No, going to bed.
[180:24.53]Going to bed early and waking up at 5.
[180:26.05]I just said the same thing twice.
[180:28.33]Get it together, dude.
[180:31.21]Yes, over here.
[180:32.17]I understand.
[180:36.12]Throw this.
[180:40.34]Let's just grab another one.
[180:43.22]Fun.
[180:44.38]Just to say we got one.
[180:50.40]Which condemn has the mannequins up here behind you?
[180:51.90]This one has the mannequins as well.
[180:53.95]The first one I think is more prominent.
[180:55.65]Alright, we're going to time this.
[181:00.27]We're going to try.
[181:01.03]Here we go.
[181:01.47]Ready?
[181:03.37]Here we go.
[181:10.92]Perfect.
[181:16.37]Drink this up.
[181:17.35]Grab a melee weapon.
[181:21.47]Let's get that.
[181:22.15]Let's get the golf club.
[181:25.77]No.
[181:31.49]That was lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.
[181:34.72]I can tell you now.
[181:36.04]Luck is on my side with that one.
[181:39.64]Why am I stuck?
[181:52.44]Third try.
[181:54.02]Drinking through the mask.
[181:55.76]Yeah, I'm taking a nice sip through the mask.
[181:59.12]There's gonna be another one, and I'm gonna get caught.
[182:00.82]I'm gonna get caught by him.
[182:02.71]I'm gonna get grabbed by him.
[182:05.06]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[182:06.24]Move, move, move.
[182:07.92]How come he doesn't need a gas mask?
[182:12.12]Apparently he doesn't.
[182:16.31]He can breathe through his gills.
[182:17.51]Heh heh.
[182:39.24]I thought the whole room was on fire.
[182:46.61]So that guy does not add anything to the story.
[182:49.43]It's just a guy that was stuck.
[182:54.21]Guy stuck.
[182:55.25]Keep jumping down?
[183:03.56]Yes, but let's see what's over here first.
[183:10.07]Well, we ain't going back now.
[183:14.64]And this, this, this, this vision.
[183:16.50]This, this, this paintball mask.
[183:24.53]Not only is this a paintball mask.
[183:27.43]But this is a rental paintball mask.
[183:29.49]Those of you that have gone paintballing before.
[183:32.80]I never owned paintball equipment.
[183:35.60]But when you went to a paintball place, you could rent everything.
[183:38.57]You could rent the paintball gun, you could rent the paintball mask, and the paintball vest.
[183:43.43]Yeah, I put on one of the vests.
[183:45.69]I put on one of the... It's a giant, like, chef outfit that has the... It's like the bulletproof vest.
[183:50.78]I used one of those.
[183:55.30]They were all scuffed up and fucked up like this.
[184:09.53]I didn't use it every, and it doesn't even matter.
[184:11.65]Look, even if you have the vest on, I had the vest, I had the mask, I had the extra protection.
[184:16.77]It was like 20 extra dollars for the extra protection.
[184:19.45]And guess what?
[184:20.47]The mask goes on the front of your face like this, like Kylo Ren.
[184:23.78]It protects like here.
[184:25.92]The drape protects here.
[184:28.84]Nothing under here.
[184:30.40]I got shot in the neck with a paintball after all the gear being on.
[184:34.86]And it was one of the most excruciating experiences of my entire life.
[184:40.45]All that doesn't matter.
[184:42.62]What do they say?
[184:43.48]The guy with all the armor on, all you gotta do is you gotta find the little spot in the elbow there.
[184:48.96]You just stick it in.
[184:49.68]You'll find it.
[184:52.34]All that protection.
[184:54.62]For nothing.
[184:57.04]It actually hurts.
[184:58.34]It actually hurts a lot.
[184:59.31]Did it turn the furnace off?
[185:09.95]Yeah, of course I did.
[185:16.07]I got... I gave me access to grenades, but what do I need to throw in the furnace?
[185:20.28]I'm gonna... I'm gonna say, yes, I have to throw this in the furnace.
[185:29.76]I guess not.
[185:30.14]There's more than one valve.
[185:35.10]Well, I got it in.
[185:43.96]tender neck.
[185:45.54]No, man.
[185:46.70]That hurts.
[185:47.48]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[186:01.37]What's up with the Star Wars laser baby grenades?
[186:05.56]I would love to be able to answer that question.
[186:08.54]But I can't.
[186:17.21]What is even happening in this game?
[186:18.35]I don't know.
[186:27.85]That's the unfortunate thing about this game, is I don't know.
[186:30.43]Alright, blow this up, you got it.
[186:34.83]That's gonna move it all.
[186:37.51]Yes it is.
[186:41.35]Let me continue playing my game.
[186:50.82]But yeah, like, the first game... The first game wasn't this... insane.
[186:57.84]It was a dumb story, but... You were fighting humans.
[187:02.22]Where are the ogres?
[187:03.04]Remember the ogres?
[187:05.22]I'll take, like, random Shrek-thing enemies, then.
[187:09.49]These guys.
[187:15.53]Still on fire?
[187:20.78]This shit is still on fire.
[187:22.00]What did I turn off?
[187:25.48]What did that even go to?
[187:28.10]Down here?
[187:28.52]There's probably another one that I have to get.
[187:34.52]If I'm a betting man, I would bet on that.
[187:38.59]That was down there somewhere.
[187:41.69]Back down we go.
[187:50.67]Yeah, backtracking.
[187:52.65]What were they thinking?
[187:56.05]Okay, um, speaking of thinking... What the hell did that even do?
[188:03.26]Oh, got rid of this.
[188:09.60]Oh, fucking prick.
[188:15.35]Itchy eye.
[188:18.61]Like, really itchy eye.
[188:21.18]Itchy eye that's causing lots of problems.
[188:23.18]Other eye is itching now.
[188:24.42]Once one stops, the other, it doesn't stop.
[188:31.21]Cake?
[188:32.43]They had, like, the cake question mark before Portal did.
[188:34.51]How do you eat cake?
[188:37.55]Right here.
[188:45.32]Right?
[188:46.70]No...
[188:51.91]What?
[188:54.01]Break the glass?
[188:54.73]I gotta let more oxygen enter the room?
[189:00.55]Take a picture of it?
[189:02.17]Scan it?
[189:03.64]Forensify it?
[189:04.38]I don't know.
[189:10.24]Patty cake.
[189:12.78]Guess I just gotta keep going this way.
[189:18.06]Rightness tracks.
[189:18.66]That's the strategy.
[189:21.31]Like allergies or something.
[189:22.31]What the hell is going on?
[189:31.37]Thank God there's a safe point here.
[189:33.01]I would have been so upset if I died for some reason.
[189:35.96]Now I don't care if I die.
[189:36.98]Now I'm going to ring the bell.
[189:41.02]And survive.
[189:49.01]And bootleg Harley Quinn.
[189:55.94]Or, a little more accurate, a Bioshock enemy.
[190:02.40]We're down in Rapture now.
[190:03.88]We may as well be in Rapture.
[190:09.00]That hurt.
[190:30.64]Okay, she's throwing bombs.
[190:31.68]Is this a boss?
[190:36.04]I can do that too, lady.
[190:38.42]You want to go bomb for bomb here?
[190:39.76]I'm going to pre... Look, you just got to go where she's going to be.
[190:45.87]And you got to hit her right in the bum.
[190:48.99]She bends over.
[190:49.73]She's like an old Simpsons arcade boss.
[190:53.35]When she shows her underwear, you have to explode her.
[190:59.99]We got it.
[191:05.93]That was a perfect hit.
[191:07.87]That was a direct hit.
[191:17.43]Oh shit.
[191:24.86]I gotta wait till she moves a different way.
[191:27.14]Going this way, and then she's gonna go over here.
[191:28.96]Get it when she goes this way.
[191:37.72]I got a direct hit on her, too.
[191:38.97]I'm just gonna hit her again.
[191:48.25]I don't think that's the end of her time, though.
[191:53.72]Is she still alive?
[191:54.26]Did she die?
[191:55.16]Did she fall down somewhere?
[191:57.10]I thought that was her.
[192:01.98]No, she's in here somewhere.
[192:08.49]Alright, what about alcohol?
[192:10.41]Booze?
[192:11.71]No booze.
[192:12.83]That's okay.
[192:14.37]That's her lollipop chainsaw.
[192:17.25]Oh.
[192:19.42]Lollipop chainsaw.
[192:22.18]That's who it was.
[192:26.25]Oh well.
[192:27.11]We tried.
[192:27.49]Just kind of obstructing the view quite a bit.
[192:40.34]Look at my screen.
[192:45.16]I have a fucking square this big that I can see.
[192:52.30]And it's dirty.
[192:53.16]It's a rental.
[192:56.98]My screen is this dirty too.
[192:59.84]It's a triple whammy.
[193:00.90]It's a quadruple whammy.
[193:04.54]This is a quadruple whammy like the likes I've never seen.
[193:07.74]12 FPS.
[193:12.72]Dirty rental paintball mask.
[193:14.80]Obstructed chainsaw.
[193:19.13]And a GameStop controller.
[193:21.83]This is like a YouTube series that somebody's making a joke.
[193:26.58]Like, oh man, I'm gonna have one arm tied behind my back using a GameStop controller with a paintball mask on.
[193:37.03]Somebody should make that series.
[193:38.13]Man, it's in VR.
[193:50.69]Okay, we gotta break here.
[193:56.70]Note service elevator ID.
[193:58.10]Oh, I'm just gonna... Service elevator ID.
[194:04.59]There it is.
[194:04.91]It's 4G.
[194:08.45]Service elevator 4G.
[194:10.01]4C.
[194:10.17]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[194:12.41]4... 4... 4C.
[194:12.49]How's that good?
[194:12.87]That should be perfect.
[194:14.40]It's not 4C?
[194:15.02]It is 4G.
[194:15.20]Is it 4G?
[194:26.96]How is that good and not perfect?
[194:34.66]I'm so busy being annoyed by that that I don't even know what the hell their conversation just was.
[194:42.65]Shit ain't even LTE.
[194:44.11]No.
[194:47.09]Idiots don't even have LTE.
[194:48.19]What does LTE even mean?
[194:53.42]Why don't you just call it 4G?
[194:56.89]4G.
[194:57.36]Why is that so hard?
[195:03.22]4G LTE.
[195:11.45]It means real good.
[195:12.55]Long-term enhancement.
[195:14.81]What does it actually mean?
[195:15.55]Somebody knows.
[195:16.23]One of you guys in chat actually has to know what that means.
[195:20.61]4G and 4G LTE are not the same thing.
[195:24.75]Okay, so, well, what is 4G?
[195:27.29]What is LTE?
[195:31.81]Long-term evolution.
[195:39.00]Long-term what?
[195:44.98]I've got to get rid of the chainsaw here.
[195:53.58]I wonder if I can make it.
[195:56.07]I'm supposed to look for more evidence or something here.
[195:58.09]Right.
[195:59.29]What else do I need to do?
[196:01.99]Long-term evolution.
[196:05.55]I don't believe you.
[196:06.13]I don't think that's right.
[196:07.17]I actually don't believe you guys.
[196:09.83]I don't think it's long-term evolution.
[196:12.42]What does LTE mean?
[196:20.54]It doesn't even say... Google doesn't even say what it is.
[196:23.81]LTE, long-term evolution.
[196:32.63]That sounds like such a made-up name.
[196:34.99]That does not sound like a made-up name to you guys?
[196:36.88]Alright, the term 4G LTE is really two terms.
[196:44.22]4G means the fourth generation of data technology for cellular networks following 3G.
[196:49.73]LTE stands for long-term evolution and is short for a very technical process for high-speed data for phones and other mobile devices Okay, that still didn't answer my question.
[197:07.38]What does that mean?
[197:08.98]It's really complicated.
[197:10.24]That's what they said.
[197:11.18]It's 4G, but it's complicated 4G.
[197:21.19]Where am I?
[197:23.39]Low tier entertainment.
[197:31.84]I just had to turn on the elevator.
[197:40.22]Shit.
[197:47.93]Wait, I gotta cut blue and red wires now?
[197:50.57]Oh no.
[197:54.74]Correctly rewire the panel Connector to connector to red wire white wire bare wire Okay connector one is there is there something I can look at here that tells me what to do Okay connector one is is a solid green and
[198:30.52]Striped, right?
[198:32.12]Striped.
[198:33.10]Connector 1 is striped.
[198:35.15]Connectors 2 is solid.
[198:36.81]Connectors 3 is circle.
[198:41.61]Connector 3.
[198:41.93]Thick wire.
[198:56.28]There we go.
[198:56.74]I got it.
[198:57.18]So...
[198:59.01]Connector 1 is this one.
[199:00.75]Connector 3 is the Candy Cane.
[199:04.01]We've got Candy Cane, Comcast, and Earthworm.
[199:09.21]All right.
[199:09.59]So, the other way around, Jeremy.
[199:12.34]Earthworm, Comcast, Candy Cane.
[199:18.29]Okay, earthworm.
[199:20.03]Why am I looking for earthworm?
[199:22.05]Like, I named it something, but it's actually named something in the game.
[199:26.46]It's... It's the... Three is candy cane.
[199:30.66]Stripe wire.
[199:33.62]Two is comcast, which is thick wire.
[199:39.92]And this is... Bear wire?
[199:44.43]Brown wire?
[199:47.08]Stripped wire?
[199:48.14]What would it be called?
[199:49.24]Stripped wire?
[199:51.06]I think it's a stripped wire.
[199:52.20]No, it's... No, no, no, no.
[199:53.28]Stripped.
[199:53.82]Striped.
[199:54.76]It's a bare wire.
[199:57.58]Perfect.
[199:58.02]Is somebody coming?
[200:09.51]Is somebody jumping?
[200:10.29]Somebody's jumping down in here, I think.
[200:17.90]Here comes another yawn, I'm sorry!
[200:20.16]Why are we embarrassed about yawning?
[200:25.49]How many times have you guys, and sneezing, placed the fuse?
[200:31.84]Where am I supposed to get the fuse?
[200:32.92]Did the fuse drop on the ground over here?
[200:38.14]Have you noticed that you will do anything possible to not yawn?
[200:41.56]To make it not look like you're yawning?
[200:43.12]If you're sitting there with friends or family or something, and you have to yawn, you're like, fuck, man, I don't want to yawn.
[200:47.74]I don't want to yawn.
[200:48.58]It's embarrassing.
[200:50.06]It's rude.
[200:51.35]So you do that like... And everyone's like... People think you're sick.
[201:01.79]So you look even stranger trying as hard as you fucking can to not yawn.
[201:07.14]When if you just yawned like a normal human, you would have been fine.
[201:16.66]I just yawned?
[201:17.71]But I'm talking about those of us that don't.
[201:23.74]Same thing with a sneeze.
[201:25.42]If I have to sneeze, I go like this.
[201:27.06]I go like... Instead of like... Sometimes I'll do it like that, but if I'm with friends or something, a family, or from a public setting, I'm like... And it fucking hurts!
[201:37.18]It hurts really bad.
[201:39.22]You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[201:40.66]You hurt yourself.
[201:43.85]If you're in the library or you're in a movie theater or something, you go like... It sucks.
[201:55.30]Where am I going?
[202:01.94]Don't hold it in?
[202:04.08]But what if, like... What if, like... The actor!
[202:09.69]I can't name an actor right now.
[202:12.25]What if Burt Reynolds is about... Why is that the actor?
[202:15.31]Okay, if Burt Reynolds is about to kiss...
[202:19.41]The girl of his dreams on camera and everybody's like at the edge of their seat is Burt Reynolds gonna kiss her?
[202:25.57]Is Burt Reynolds and Cate Blanchett gonna do this?
[202:28.16]Oh, they're in love and you just hear like Richard it ruins the whole movie and you fucked up under person's entire evening because then they look over behind everyone gets fucking irritated How mad do you get when somebody sneezes in a public place when you're in a restaurant?
[202:43.05]You get angry
[202:44.79]I get angry when I hear somebody sneeze.
[202:47.09]It's weird.
[202:47.97]I hear, like, and I'm like, motherfucker.
[202:52.01]Fuck.
[202:55.35]It's just a normal human reaction.
[202:58.29]And if somebody sneezes two or three times in a row... What did you fucking just say?
[203:05.92]It's like they told me that my mother sucks.
[203:14.03]Where's this fuse?
[203:19.92]And then some people think it's real funny to sneeze really loudly.
[203:23.80]And they think it's fucking hilarious.
[203:27.08]And they go like... And it's like, yeah, hey, you don't... It's not funny, man.
[203:43.64]Me?
[203:44.39]I've done that on camera before.
[203:46.41]I've done the thing I'm angry about.
[203:48.69]Where... Where is this fucking fuse?
[203:52.05]I have not been paying any attention to it.
[203:54.82]Something fell... Okay, I think we have to climb this.
[203:58.50]Yeah, we have to do Super Mario World.
[204:01.49]Castle 3.
[204:02.91]Climb and, like, bop the Koopas.
[204:14.94]Found it.
[204:21.69]I'm dead.
[204:31.23]What a gamer reference.
[204:32.03]What a nice gamer reference that was.
[204:35.91]You know, I'm like an old school gamer, guys.
[204:37.89]I used to hop.
[204:39.37]I used to hop and bounce and jump on the groupers.
[204:42.05]I used to do it all the time.
[204:47.23]Why does the duck have to be a quick time event?
[204:56.68]Catch it!
[204:57.94]Let's take some HP.
[205:00.92]Oh, there's a fuse.
[205:01.80]Alright.
[205:02.68]Oh, the guy's gonna be screaming around the corner.
[205:04.16]I already know it.
[205:05.14]I'm already prepared for it.
[205:10.12]There's a baby.
[205:13.50]Can I gnaw it?
[205:24.86]Got it!
[205:37.01]I need to get a- I need to get a weapon.
[205:42.26]Get a weapon!
[205:53.44]Emergency!
[206:05.33]It's already broken?
[206:06.17]Are you kidding me?
[206:14.14]I just got cartwheeled.
[206:15.12]Where am I?
[206:15.52]I'm in the... We got our best weapon in the game.
[206:19.64]We finally found it.
[206:20.36]The board.
[206:26.58]I can't see.
[206:27.36]I... What am I doing this for?
[206:29.19]I can't see anything.
[206:35.99]Oh, for the love of God.
[206:37.65]What have I done?
[206:43.14]Take her weapon.
[206:43.82]Smash her.
[206:58.25]And why won't she die?
[207:00.19]Why is she still around?
[207:04.81]Why am I upside down?
[207:06.35]Are we hanging upside down?
[207:08.65]I've lost all control.
[207:10.07]I don't know which way I'm facing.
[207:13.29]We could be in Inception where I'm standing on the ceiling and I wouldn't know.
[207:31.64]Let's play!
[207:39.64]I'm gonna juice her.
[207:41.06]Yep, she's gonna get juiced.
[207:42.02]Holy shit.
[207:42.34]Alright.
[207:42.74]And I get my favorite weapon.
[207:44.32]No, I want my favorite weapon.
[208:11.93]Now where the heck am I supposed to go?
[208:14.00]Where the heck am I supposed to go?
[208:16.38]Alright, the fuse, right.
[208:28.13]Stop it.
[208:32.55]Why are you here?
[208:33.85]Alright, I don't know what that looked like on face cam.
[208:41.14]But it was probably really embarrassing.
[208:51.45]I don't need to... I don't need to know.
[208:59.01]Fuse in.
[208:59.89]Let's get out of here.
[209:04.56]Missing audio, too.
[209:05.50]I don't know why.
[209:08.84]Why do I look so shy on face cam?
[209:14.01]Because I'm a fucking weirdo.
[209:17.67]I told you, like, there are, like, 21, 2200 people here watching.
[209:22.19]And all I can think of is, like, somebody looking at my nose hairs.
[209:27.10]I'll be in the middle of a fight.
[209:29.22]Really intense fight.
[209:30.34]Big battle.
[209:32.20]Can people see my fucking nose hairs right now?
[209:36.82]And then I go, like, I don't know what happened here.
[209:38.69]I don't know.
[209:45.97]lighting isn't good enough I mean I have a thing over here I don't turn it on ever so I'm just getting progressively worse you scared the crap out of me ethan where's your car where's your car let's go my gun
[210:10.40]Okay, I'm good.
[210:10.68]And nobody even knew what happened.
[210:43.45]Okay, I got a holster.
[210:45.35]Stow a handgun, subgun, or short barrel shot at that guy so I can store stuff now.
[210:56.08]This face cam is like too big.
[210:57.90]This has ruined the whole game.
[211:00.06]This has ruined everything.
[211:02.20]This is huge.
[211:03.10]Why didn't anybody tell me this was too big?
[211:06.16]More remarkable is the extensive damage done to the chest area.
[211:09.74]That's like ruining the whole fucking game.
[211:16.62]Now the killer inserted what I'm guessing to be a large hunting knife, roughly six to eight inches in length, here at the base of the belly.
[211:24.21]He then made an X-shaped incision that extends up to the bottom of the chin.
[211:29.92]He clearly was not concerned with surgical technique.
[211:32.72]Why does everybody tell me my ass was this big?
[211:35.32]You are, you fucking get it.
[211:39.10]Smelling the air in the can.
[211:42.52]What a classic movie.
[211:43.50]Please watch it.
[211:44.08]Spaceballs.
[211:45.15]All right.
[211:47.11]Take a look at this.
[211:53.37]When I first examined the crime scene photos you sent me, I was a little taken back by the abnormal structure of his vocal cords.
[212:01.31]Uses technical terms, but then uses the word belly.
[212:05.40]There's so much to collect.
[212:07.56]The best joke that's ever been done.
[212:13.78]We're going to talk about this because this is important.
[212:17.73]This is the funniest joke.
[212:18.55]The best joke ever.
[212:29.46]in any piece of media that's ever happened.
[212:31.50]We'll talk about it in a second.
[212:34.76]After this cutscene that everyone's so into is played out.
[212:39.62]What?
[212:40.78]Yeah.
[212:41.54]And the question is, who's trying to keep it a secret?
[212:46.37]Yes, it is the videotape scene.
[212:47.93]That's the best, absolute best humor, best joke I've ever fucking experienced.
[212:54.00]So if you've never seen Spaceballs, it gets to a point in the middle of the movie where Rick Moranis, who, by the way, fucking legendary Rick Moranis,
[213:03.59]Rick Moranis says Lord Helmet and his trusted general, they're trying to figure out where the rebels went.
[213:11.52]We have to track them down.
[213:12.40]We don't know where they are.
[213:13.48]Oh, I have an idea.
[213:15.38]Let's put in Spaceballs the movie.
[213:17.90]Their movie, the one that they're currently in right now.
[213:20.19]They put it in.
[213:20.65]It's a VHS tape and they put it in and they fast forward the movie.
[213:26.27]And they're watching the fucking movie to try to find where they are in the movie, later in the movie.
[213:32.11]And it gets to a point where... Wait, wait, I'm ruining the joke?
[213:40.73]We should just watch it.
[213:42.59]Will I get in trouble for that?
[213:43.91]Is Twitch staff here?
[213:48.93]Like, is Twitch staff gonna... If I watch a scene in Spaceballs, am I gonna get in trouble?
[214:00.27]I don't know if Spencer's here or God is here.
[214:04.48]Because I actually might get in trouble for watching a five-minute copyright video.
[214:08.80]Oh, whatever.
[214:13.04]Let's see if I get sued.
[214:25.89]Here it is.
[214:27.03]This is...
[214:29.96]I gotta get this in the right spot.
[214:31.16]We're gonna take a second here.
[214:32.35]Because we need to watch it.
[214:34.01]It's worth it.
[214:34.37]It's two and a half, it's like two minutes and thirty seconds long.
[214:39.69]I need to plug this in here, so hold on.
[214:41.13]I'm gonna go back over here.
[214:45.80]This is like just classic, fucking classic comedy.
[214:50.50]Sorry about that loud ding.
[214:53.92]Yeah.
[214:59.95]There we go.
[215:00.59]That should be it.
[215:02.87]Have you found them yet?
[215:04.87]No, Lord Helmet.
[215:05.73]They're still not on the scanner.
[215:07.51]Well, keep looking for them.
[215:10.67]Watch it.
[215:14.84]Fucking ad.
[215:16.40]I can't even get rid of it.
[215:18.32]Pardon me, sir.
[215:19.24]I have an idea.
[215:20.76]Corporal, get me the videocassette of Spaceballs the movie.
[215:24.42]Yes, sir.
[215:29.85]Colonel Sanders, may I speak with you, please?
[215:34.50]Colonel Sanders?
[215:35.40]The guy's name is Colonel fucking Sanders.
[215:37.72]We're still in the middle of making it.
[215:39.14]That's true, sir.
[215:40.20]But there's been a new breakthrough in home video marketing.
[215:42.94]There is?
[215:43.22]Yes.
[215:44.02]Instant cassettes.
[215:45.36]They're out in stores before the movie is finished.
[215:47.61]Nah.
[215:49.51]Here it is, sir.
[215:51.27]Spaceballs.
[215:52.99]Good work, Corporal.
[215:53.61]Punch it up.
[215:54.03]I can't close the ad.
[215:59.06]They put it in, they're watching the fucking movie.
[216:01.02]They're watching the movie.
[216:29.96]Electric club.
[216:33.56]Look at it.
[216:42.00]Now?
[216:42.14]It's fucking perfect.
[217:11.87]That's perfect.
[217:12.89]That's a perfect fucking setup.
[217:15.06]Perfect joke.
[217:17.44]And I'll see you after I get banned from this website.
[217:20.00]I'm gone for like two weeks.
[217:27.20]Okay, but yes, this is the... Uh-oh, Spencer.
[217:29.62]Is that allowed, Spencer?
[217:30.58]Am I going to get arrested for doing that?
[217:34.00]Watching a one-minute clip?
[217:36.78]That's the only time I've ever done it.
[217:38.86]Okay, you just, like, pulled me over, and I was speeding.
[217:41.14]Are you going to give me a warning?
[217:43.16]Like, are you the cop that walks over and goes, okay, you were speeding.
[217:48.24]Don't you fucking do that again.
[217:50.22]And I go, yes, sir, yes, absolutely, yes, sir, yes, officer, yes, I will not, yes.
[217:54.01]I'm currently barely driving with a controller.
[217:56.65]Probably arrested.
[217:57.53]Well, just pretend, we'll just, like, delete that one.
[217:59.61]We'll just delete that font.
[218:00.95]We'll just, like, X that one out.
[218:02.37]It never happened.
[218:03.95]Back to the game.
[218:06.26]Oh, shit, I can't hear.
[218:10.75]Do you know how fast you were pirating that video?
[218:20.99]Would you steal a car?
[218:22.75]Would you steal a car, son?
[218:24.29]Alright, photograph his chest.
[218:31.58]Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
[218:32.38]Over here.
[218:32.72]Photograph the x-ray.
[218:35.93]Wait, why would I need to photograph the x-ray?
[218:38.95]Photograph chest x-ray.
[218:40.35]It's already photographed.
[218:41.93]It's already here.
[218:43.03]It's a photograph of his chest.
[218:47.35]But I need to take a picture of this picture with my digital camera.
[218:54.06]This is next level shit that your mother would do to document photos.
[218:59.59]You would grab your mother's hand and be like, Ma, no, no, no, no, no, Ma.
[219:02.35]There's a thing called Facebook.
[219:04.90]You don't have to do that.
[219:06.16]Oh, I don't have to take photos of every picture I have and store them in my digital SD card?
[219:10.24]Mom, no.
[219:11.84]Just upload them to the cloud.
[219:15.91]That's a Spaceballs caliber joke.
[219:17.37]I could have written for that movie.
[219:25.11]You can't send photos IRL over the web.
[219:31.40]He can.
[219:31.66]Wait a minute, I don't understand how x-rays work.
[219:37.06]It's a picture of inside the guy's chest with a super camera.
[219:40.40]That's all it is.
[219:41.38]It's a radiation camera.
[219:42.54]Do I have to get in this?
[219:44.74]Are we going to get a hole in one here?
[219:46.16]What do I do?
[219:52.16]Actually, I do have to lie down on this.
[219:55.77]It's called a fax machine.
[219:56.89]Yeah, place that down.
[219:58.53]Fax it.
[220:02.40]I don't have to do all this other bullshit.
[220:08.88]Whoops.
[220:10.04]OK, there we go.
[220:16.93]What?
[220:17.13]I didn't have a chance to respond.
[220:18.25]Wait.
[220:21.15]Ugh.
[220:22.59]Why am I so itchy?
[220:23.30]First it was my eyes, now it's my nose, now it's my mouth.
[220:27.32]I'm super itchy.
[220:30.74]And you turned up the machine too high.
[220:33.68]Now I'm fucked forever.
[220:37.99]It must be those nose hairs.
[220:40.83]Explore the SCU offices.
[220:45.33]Okay.
[220:52.42]Time to fight some medical people.
[220:55.80]Doctors.
[220:56.26]Scientists.
[221:02.22]Not shown.
[221:03.38]Me.
[221:04.24]Sun.
[221:05.30]Sun me.
[221:06.52]Radical cyclization.
[221:13.96]A caterpillar.
[221:16.36]94%.
[221:16.38]PE.
[221:19.73]What was I doing there?
[221:20.69]I don't know.
[221:23.41]Can't leave.
[221:28.73]There's nothing in here.
[221:29.87]Wait.
[221:30.59]No.
[221:33.20]Exploring.
[221:38.18]Can't pick up the soda?
[221:40.90]Diet Squiz?
[221:43.31]Diet Squish.
[221:45.21]That is a great name for a soda.
[221:48.09]Fizzy Haha.
[221:51.13]Squish.
[221:51.61]I imagine Squish being really citrusy.
[221:57.26]I wish that existed.
[222:01.24]I'm not even kidding.
[222:01.80]I really wish that actually existed.
[222:03.34]I want one right now.
[222:04.10]I want a squish.
[222:13.05]See Sprite?
[222:14.51]Sprite has too hard of a T. If Sprite was like Spritz.
[222:21.35]Spriz.
[222:22.81]Sprite.
[222:24.09]I don't like the T. Sprite.
[222:27.34]Too harsh.
[222:29.42]Spritz.
[222:34.79]spritzo sprit spritzo spritz squirt squiz squish squash any of those would do not that way what about diet what about dr blizzard
[223:01.38]Blizzard would be, I could imagine Blizzard having a lemon.
[223:05.28]You know those shark popsicles?
[223:11.12]The lemon shark popsicle?
[223:14.28]That's what Dr. Blizzard tastes like to me if I was drinking it.
[223:20.33]I want a shark popsicle now.
[223:25.59]Fuck.
[223:25.81]This is the best.
[223:31.72]Lemon Lime Shark Popsicle.
[223:32.94]You don't... You guys don't know what I'm talking about.
[223:34.98]The ice cream truck.
[223:36.66]Type it in.
[223:37.36]Just Google it.
[223:37.92]You'll see.
[223:38.64]Just type in Lemon Shark Popsicle.
[223:41.56]You'll see it.
[223:42.02]You know, when you see it.
[223:46.88]You shit bricks.
[223:47.80]You know what I mean?
[223:48.24]When you see it.
[223:57.13]Didn't they make a horror movie?
[223:58.67]Not a horror movie, a horror game.
[223:59.93]About exactly what I'm doing right now.
[224:02.71]It was called, like, You Work Too Much.
[224:04.68]What was the name of that game?
[224:08.90]You walk around an office and you go to your computer and there's a scary person that comes out and you work late nights.
[224:27.96]Okay, we're going we're going between dimensions Late late shift that one late night.
[224:34.42]Yeah one late night.
[224:38.20]I Tried to play that game Yeah, I can I gave up with it and like to it like maybe like 20 minutes I
[224:52.91]Stanley Parable?
[224:53.77]Stanley Parable was at least interesting.
[224:55.37]It was fun.
[224:56.47]The narrator was funny.
[224:58.45]He had a lot of things to say.
[224:59.50]There were the different endings.
[225:00.68]It was made by one guy.
[225:03.34]Stan.
[225:04.04]Stanley.
[225:04.70]Stanley made that game.
[225:05.70]Stan Parable.
[225:09.94]It's an achievement.
[225:11.93]I'll say.
[225:12.23]I'm not going to play Stanley Parable on stream.
[225:24.17]I would sooner stream vanilla Minecraft than the Stanley Parable.
[225:40.20]What am I supposed to be doing?
[225:41.68]Just walking around with my head just completely and totally in the clouds here.
[225:54.99]Watch out.
[225:56.77]So this is like in the past.
[225:58.31]I did this in the future.
[225:59.91]Check out the monsters.
[226:07.77]Monsters in the men's room.
[226:11.22]That's definitely the best 80s horror movie, comedy, dark horror, dark comedy movie I've ever thought of.
[226:20.52]Monsters in the men's room.
[226:34.76]I understand this is supposed to be scary, but... I'm gonna make a fake advertisement for Monsters in the Men's Room.
[226:44.34]You guys think I'm kidding?
[226:46.75]There's a video that's gonna be, like, eventually made that needs commercial breaks.
[226:54.67]Monsters in the Men's Room is going to be one of the commercials.
[227:00.52]Promise.
[227:01.10]You'll see.
[227:14.87]I feel like I've missed something important.
[227:18.55]Do I need to beat up the shadow monster person that's running around?
[227:22.08]I didn't go over here yet, did I?
[227:24.44]I did.
[227:24.70]So where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[227:27.32]Do I need to witness something?
[227:29.94]GPS?
[227:32.26]UV?
[227:33.88]UVB light?
[227:34.70]UVB rays?
[227:35.40]UVA?
[227:37.56]SPF?
[227:40.22]Comedy?
[227:41.58]Comedian?
[227:44.58]Comedy technique?
[227:52.15]Yeah, please turn off the motion blur.
[227:55.85]Unfortunately, I would love to, but this is a console game.
[228:00.29]And there are no options to remove them.
[228:02.67]Unfortunately.
[228:04.31]Unfortunately for all of us.
[228:07.69]There's nothing I can do.
[228:11.09]Speaking of nothing I can do, I am getting a little lost here.
[228:22.00]Does the X mark the spot?
[228:23.78]What about over here?
[228:28.04]I got a shitload of bugs in my hair, so just don't mind me.
[228:34.99]Can't go anywhere.
[228:43.94]Shit.
[228:50.69]I really do feel like I've just been walking in circles.
[228:57.91]I must have missed something in one of these other rooms.
[228:59.87]I have no idea.
[229:00.77]I wish I knew what the hell was going on.
[229:11.92]What did I miss?
[229:19.36]Radio?
[229:20.70]No.
[229:20.82]When did this game come out?
[229:25.23]A long time ago.
[229:30.43]2008?
[229:30.65]2007?
[229:38.79]I can't say so far.
[229:39.81]I would say this game is very fun and funny.
[229:48.87]But I'm getting the vibe that I don't think I'm going to like this one as much as the first one.
[229:56.07]In the grand, big picture, the grand scheme of things.
[230:12.02]Jackpot.
[230:12.80]Bingo.
[230:13.60]Found it.
[230:19.26]The first one was crazy.
[230:21.28]And it was crazy because they threw these random psycho enemies at you.
[230:25.75]This random AI was just hilarious.
[230:27.63]And they all had their own weird shit that they did.
[230:32.77]And hiding and trying to find you.
[230:35.45]And it seems like this game tried to be more of a scary game.
[230:39.69]With stuff like this in it.
[230:41.68]And terrifying weird mutant enemies.
[230:44.14]And...
[230:47.07]I kind of miss just fighting a bunch of, like, drunk psychos.
[230:50.50]Because, like, take a... If you guys do, like, a sample size of the enemies that we fought... Getting a real bad ratio of, uh, drunk psycho to mutant baby alien people and flaming zombie human.
[231:19.20]Legit, last time I was in here, I heard this is already in my top 5 games of all time.
[231:23.72]It's better than Oak Arena of Time.
[231:30.60]Yes.
[231:32.36]And you didn't see what happened there.
[231:35.83]You could throw items in this game.
[231:39.67]So, it's just already in the top 5.
[231:43.85]I guess that has changed.
[231:46.11]Finally, a person to punch.
[231:51.11]Mr. Thomas, right?
[231:52.75]I'm Agent Pennington, head of security.
[231:54.19]Hey, can you hear me?
[231:56.13]Are you hurt?
[231:58.84]I'm fine.
[231:59.88]What the hell's going on?
[232:01.08]I need to do this to talk to you through the fucking wall.
[232:03.14]We're evacuating the building.
[232:06.12]He's dead.
[232:06.36]We'll see if you can open it from your side.
[232:08.14]The magnetic locks didn't release when the power went out.
[232:11.26]Try opening from your side.
[232:12.35]Nah.
[232:19.37]Mr. Thomas?
[232:21.14]I guess it didn't work on my end.
[232:49.59]You gonna give me a gun, man?
[232:51.81]Pennington?
[232:52.33]Come on, give me a gun.
[232:55.31]Give me something to work with.
[232:58.97]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[233:00.53]Ugh, thumbtacks.
[233:06.28]Is he eating that?
[233:06.96]How'd you eat that?
[233:16.78]No response.
[233:18.14]Doesn't have anything to say about it.
[233:19.36]He just wanted to put his face and mouth all over that and not say anything about it.
[233:23.26]It's like, hey, Paddington.
[233:25.68]Paddington, why are you doing that?
[233:34.76]Whatever it is, it's not there anymore, and it was gone a long time before you were done shooting.
[233:43.08]This actually is just turning into fear.
[233:45.14]And they made fear.
[233:48.12]Monolith made fear.
[233:50.53]This is just fear now.
[233:53.47]When did fear come out?
[233:58.97]What year did fear come out?
[234:04.12]You gonna handle this?
[234:04.88]I don't have a gun, man.
[234:05.52]I can't go over there.
[234:16.87]You have to handle this.
[234:17.57]Not me.
[234:40.59]Even he's having trouble with the boxes too.
[234:48.03]God damn it!
[234:49.43]Oh, that would have hit him right in the face.
[234:51.46]Glass would have gone all over his mouth.
[235:10.06]There we go.
[235:11.34]Oh my god, aiming is... That wasn't even fucking close.
[235:17.25]That was it.
[235:17.73]He's dead.
[235:18.15]That was very no- Whatever.
[235:40.85]This guy had no HP.
[235:42.13]Look at this gun.
[235:44.57]I'm not gonna hit anybody with this.
[235:46.69]You've seen how fucking sloppy I am with these analogs.
[235:49.67]He's gonna get scooped up.
[235:52.63]Watch.
[235:54.00]Ceiling's gonna cave in.
[235:54.78]He's gonna get grabbed.
[236:01.28]Same thing's gonna happen to this guy.
[236:04.56]Let's see.
[236:04.92]Can I get a good headshot here?
[236:15.69]I ain't doing this.
[236:18.57]Just so you know what's happening on my screen.
[236:24.62]Even this close?
[236:25.68]I feel like I'm playing Guitar Hero.
[236:40.34]Exploded his head, ladies and gentlemen.
[236:42.14]What the hell was that?
[236:51.12]I got disappeared.
[237:13.80]What was... I'm having trouble with words tonight.
[237:16.70]I really am.
[237:21.35]Alright, this is an SCU locker.
[237:22.67]Probably a shotgun.
[237:23.63]It's a riot gun.
[237:24.93]And shells.
[237:26.39]Full health kit.
[237:27.65]Battery for the stun gun.
[237:29.52]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[237:34.88]I... I'm sorry.
[237:40.86]I'm sorry.
[237:41.90]I don't... I don't have much to say at the moment.
[237:45.54]I really don't.
[237:48.06]My words keep getting sucked from my mouth because I can't see.
[237:53.90]How do I comment on something that I can't even tell you what's going on?
[237:59.39]This is just a bad compressed YouTube video.
[238:06.78]Back in like fucking 2006.
[238:07.68]This is a 240p YouTube video that we are currently watching.
[238:17.17]No, this is a 240p video of a guy filming his screen with a candy can.
[238:28.41]It just is.
[238:35.04]This is what an old gameplay live let's play commentary was like in 2005.
[238:45.96]Yeah, and it's in his bandy cam.
[238:48.32]I'm dedicated to this joke.
[238:52.04]I have to turn the camera off too, guys.
[238:56.38]I'm sorry.
[239:17.14]It needs to be the right font, too.
[239:26.63]What font is the Bandicam font?
[239:33.21]Unregistered Hypercam.
[239:40.37]That's better.
[239:41.45]That's much better.
[239:43.09]Unregistered Hypercam is five times funnier.
[239:59.16]It's going to be down a little bit.
[240:00.26]Okay, I'm ready.
[240:04.01]There it is!
[240:07.95]Okay, we're having fun on our gameplay commentary.
[240:32.75]I honestly don't know what's going on.
[240:36.96]Put .NET... Wait, hold on.
[240:39.80]What does it actually say?
[240:49.34]Unregistered... Okay, the CAM is capital.
[240:52.08]Unregistered Hypercam 2.
[241:02.27]And it's got like a weird text to it.
[241:04.79]And it's black.
[241:10.93]This is staying on for the remainder of the stream.
[241:13.70]I hope you guys are aware of this.
[241:20.82]It looks a little like glitchy, right?
[241:24.72]Just put the picture at the top.
[241:26.14]That's true.
[241:26.70]I could just do that.
[241:37.80]There it is.
[241:38.16]Alright, let's play.
[241:58.04]Turn down the stream resolution.
[242:03.88]I don't... I...
[242:05.49]This joke is a funny joke if it wasn't real.
[242:11.19]Because it's actually real.
[242:16.08]Turn your mic down to low quality.
[242:17.92]Okay.
[242:18.96]We can do that too.
[242:19.74]How do I do that?
[242:21.62]That might actually break the stream.
[242:27.14]That could cause a problem.
[242:31.51]Here we go.
[242:31.85]Ready?
[242:32.25]Tell me what happens here.
[242:39.51]How does this sound?
[242:41.33]Does this sound fucked up?
[242:43.43]Are we losing quality?
[242:49.07]Yeah, how much more?
[242:51.92]Like this?
[242:53.38]How does that sound?
[243:00.04]How's this?
[243:02.66]Okay.
[243:02.78]Okay.
[243:09.47]Like that.
[243:11.55]Remove my pop filter too.
[243:12.87]Okay, hold on.
[243:15.53]Need a fan on the background too.
[243:18.10]Alright, let's do... How about this?
[243:22.10]I don't even know what this is gonna do.
[243:27.10]What is this gonna do?
[243:28.98]I don't know.
[243:30.99]I'm just playing with a ton of fucking dials.
[243:33.43]Don't know what any of them mean at all.
[243:35.25]I have no clue.
[243:36.81]I gotta remember where these were.
[243:43.03]Oh, guys, no, I have a much better idea.
[243:49.05]We're turning on the webcam audio.
[243:57.48]No, I can't.
[243:58.24]I can't pull it in.
[244:03.44]How does it sound now?
[244:05.26]Pretty terrible, right?
[244:09.00]Wait, I might be able to.
[244:12.83]I actually think I can, let's see.
[244:15.29]Properties, device, yep, I can.
[244:21.28]How's this guys?
[244:25.32]Hey, hey everybody.
[244:26.26]Yeah.
[244:30.92]Make the quality of the camera terrible too.
[244:32.52]Okay.
[244:36.65]So I did this video, I'm gonna show you just my new favorite game that I played
[244:42.83]Let's make the camera look terrible.
[244:50.36]What is making the quality of the stream awful?
[244:55.40]I'm not sure I can.
[244:56.08]Let's see.
[244:56.66]Cam properties.
[244:57.98]Yeah, I can.
[245:00.89]We can do custom resolution.
[245:02.57]We're going to change that to... Oh, dear.
[245:12.89]I don't know where it went.
[245:14.77]It's gone.
[245:16.51]Where did it go?
[245:18.75]It looks so awful on my screen.
[245:21.90]But it disappeared because it's 160 by 90.
[245:30.48]Where is it?
[245:35.15]Where's the camera?
[245:36.57]It's gone.
[245:40.47]Fuck, hold on.
[245:42.45]Reset transformation.
[245:49.92]OK.
[245:50.62]Here we go.
[245:53.10]Almost there.
[246:17.19]I'll get it.
[246:21.21]Hold on.
[246:22.55]There's a couple more things we can do.
[246:25.51]We're going to sharpen the fuck out of this.
[246:27.30]This looks like I'm from fucking 1930.
[246:44.29]And we're going to put a long cone on here.
[246:46.01]I'm going to make it look like I'm a fucking terrible streamer.
[246:54.80]One more thing.
[247:05.96]Put up the saturation like fucking crazy.
[247:26.31]That's good.
[247:26.69]That's too good.
[247:28.21]It's gotta be worse.
[247:36.51]Wow!
[247:38.28]No, that's obvious.
[247:39.42]That's too obvious.
[247:47.63]And I gotta be in the wrong spot.
[247:54.49]Down here.
[247:55.69]Right?
[247:55.91]Like... And I'm gonna be, like, fucking silent.
[247:59.75]My webcam's gonna be in a wicked embarrassing place.
[248:02.33]Like... Down here.
[248:14.63]Like that?
[248:17.52]Okay.
[248:19.50]That's good, man.
[248:25.01]It's desynced.
[248:26.87]Holy shit, this looks so fucking bad.
[248:44.04]Hold on, let me move this.
[248:49.44]Remember, like, everybody needs to fucking be in on this, because I need some... People are going to trickle in randomly, and I have to be, like, a piece of shit.
[248:57.12]You know what I mean?
[248:59.54]Okay, that's fine.
[249:02.94]Just going to add one more thing.
[249:10.47]This needs to be... It's okay.
[249:13.11]It's good.
[249:13.85]Okay, here we go.
[249:16.17]I can't... Wait, maybe I can.
[249:17.53]Yes, I can.
[249:18.33]Can I?
[249:19.70]Oh, fuck, dude.
[249:21.08]Oh, my God.
[249:21.96]It's about to get so much worse.
[249:25.24]I'm apologizing in advance.
[249:29.97]This is gonna look fucking terrible.
[249:32.03]I'm gonna fuck up the footage, too, like the actual game.
[249:34.75]And the gunners?
[249:36.68]Good call.
[250:03.73]We need to pass it through one more thing.
[250:07.59]Where is it?
[250:14.06]Okay, hold on, I gotta go back to Sharpen.
[250:19.67]Holy shit, this looks, look at this, look, you can even see it, you can see like the pixels moving.
[250:33.49]Okay, I think we're good to go.
[250:36.19]We are.
[250:48.20]Here we go.
[250:56.88]By the way, this is like irreversible.
[251:10.98]Room lights.
[251:11.98]Yep.
[251:17.06]Turn off the light.
[251:22.75]Yep, you gotta be sitting in a dark room, completely empty.
[251:27.27]I'm gonna turn these off.
[251:28.43]At least low enough where it looks really fucking creepy and like I don't know what I'm doing.
[251:34.13]And then we're gonna play and everybody needs to, you guys need to be in on this because somebody, somebody eventually is going to come to the stream
[251:41.06]And be like, what the fuck is going on here?
[251:43.96]Why does this guy have any viewers?
[251:50.46]No, that has to be it.
[251:52.14]I look like a fucking serial killer, okay?
[251:54.47]Did everyone pretend to be bots?
[252:07.39]How's that?
[252:12.63]Okay.
[252:20.03]I'm gonna restart.
[252:20.59]All right, here we go.
[252:21.23]We're starting now.
[252:30.05]I don't know what I did.
[252:41.10]I think I have to go over here.
[252:43.34]Oh, this guy, yeah.
[252:46.00]Fuck, man.
[252:50.04]Fuckin'...
[253:23.15]All right, go up there.
[253:42.16]What?
[253:45.28]No, I'll go to bed in like an hour.
[253:48.92]Yeah.
[253:51.36]OK.
[253:53.79]I've been like 20 minutes.
[254:01.66]Fucking piece of shit.
[254:10.41]Fuck.
[254:17.15]Fuck.
[254:17.61]I just don't get it every time when they come over.
[254:46.17]No!
[254:49.84]It's not what I wanted to do.
[255:21.58]God.
[255:26.65]Still having hallucinations?
[255:28.49]Perhaps it's your drinking.
[255:30.05]My drinking is not an issue.
[255:33.89]Right.
[255:35.18]Look, I'll go get this processed.
[255:37.18]In the meantime, Farrell wants to see you in his office for a mission debriefing.
[255:42.32]Fucking A. Keep your cool.
[255:44.26]Corner office, fifth floor.
[255:49.39]Yo, if you're gonna text me, man, make sure you let me know what you're doing.
[256:18.57]Is it weird that I don't want to stop doing this?
[256:31.42]All right.
[256:32.76]Let's do it.
[256:33.28]We're done.
[256:34.90]Keep doing it.
[256:36.26]All right.
[256:36.60]I'm going to make a timer for Siri.
[256:43.34]I got one more bit I want to do.
[256:44.64]Then we're done.
[257:14.49]Let me send those to you.
[257:44.59]You get the same number, dude?
[258:24.84]Oh.
[259:00.23]Thank you.
[259:43.31]Hey!
[260:18.53]You don't know what else must be doing.
[260:50.03]Alright.
[260:53.77]This fucking... We're in a loud fucking thing back here.
[261:02.46]People do this shit.
[261:08.66]People do... People used to do this shit.
[261:12.00]Like five years ago.
[261:13.24]Ugh.
[261:20.04]Alright.
[261:20.36]Dude, I don't even know if I can get it back to normal.
[261:25.00]I really don't think I can get this back to fucking normal.
[261:29.14]It's over.
[261:30.00]It's fucking ruined.
[261:31.22]I've ruined everything.
[261:33.16]Let's see.
[261:34.82]Can I just put everything to default?
[261:43.24]Jesus.
[261:44.64]Keep it this way.
[261:45.56]We might have to, considering I might not be able to get it back.
[261:47.56]Let's see.
[261:47.90]Default.
[261:49.71]No, that didn't fucking work.
[261:58.69]I think I can just delete them.
[262:03.24]Oh, lord.
[262:10.30]What do we look like now?
[262:12.70]Oh, right.
[262:13.06]I gotta go.
[262:14.20]Dude, this is gonna take, like... This is gonna take, like, another ten minutes to get this back to where it was before.
[262:20.59]Oh my lord in heaven.
[262:23.49]Alright.
[262:30.20]Oh, the lights.
[262:31.30]That's what's happening.
[262:39.44]Oh.
[262:41.56]It's just this fucking fan back here, man.
[262:48.48]People, honest to God, used to fucking play games like this and put it on the internet.
[262:53.48]Let me actually close this so it's not insane.
[262:59.20]All right.
[263:05.69]Move that.
[263:09.03]Unregistered hypercam.
[263:11.79]For the love of God.
[263:12.62]Okay.
[263:15.44]Okay.
[263:17.79]Let me turn the lights back on.
[263:20.07]At least we'll be able to see each other.
[263:22.58]Implying that I can't see you all right now.
[263:25.66]Hey, look at this.
[263:29.54]You can see my face.
[263:32.75]Wow.
[263:35.09]Oh, the mic?
[263:35.75]Oh, yeah.
[264:00.37]Hi.
[264:01.39]There we go.
[264:02.05]Okay, now we're back to somewhat normal.
[264:03.97]I still have to figure this out because this is going to take a fucking few minutes.
[264:12.78]I scaled this shit down.
[264:15.72]I have no idea what's going to happen when I do this.
[264:24.61]Oh boy.
[264:31.78]I actually think I just did it.
[264:32.60]Did I just fix it?
[264:35.86]Yeah.
[264:36.46]Oh, we're good to go.
[264:37.94]We are good to go.
[264:38.74]It didn't even take that long at all.
[264:42.37]I should have changed the IRL for that.
[264:43.81]Yeah, but that would get rid of the joke.
[264:46.11]The joke is that I'm playing a PC game.
[264:48.67]Or, no, a console game.
[264:54.76]I am going to eat the rest of these Reese's, though, because I already opened the package.
[265:02.73]By the way, this bullshit of, like, how to eat a Reese's, put the whole thing in your mouth.
[265:09.30]I just do it in one go, and you just mush it up in your gums.
[265:12.04]I used to see people eat, like, like a bunny rabbit.
[265:19.52]Mm-mm.
[265:20.62]Whole thing goes in.
[265:22.02]No chocolate mess, no chocolate fuss.
[265:25.44]Your hands stay clean.
[265:32.08]The resolution should be back to normal.
[265:36.52]It is.
[265:37.46]I hope.
[265:39.92]Oh, God.
[265:47.79]My monitor just turned off.
[265:49.25]Okay, now it's back on.
[265:50.03]That was weird.
[265:51.19]You guys can still see, right?
[266:05.41]You forgot how bad the game looks by default.
[266:08.41]Oh, it's bad.
[266:13.15]Let me show you how that works again.
[266:18.11]Again.
[266:20.13]You can eat a Reese's in two steps.
[266:24.05]Nothing weird, nothing crazy.
[266:25.23]Ready?
[266:25.71]Here's the cup in the package.
[266:28.31]Step one.
[266:29.97]Four-step.
[266:31.14]Four-step grip.
[266:32.82]Edge of package.
[266:33.86]Slide.
[266:34.94]Step one is done.
[266:36.24]Step two, mouth, teeth on edge.
[266:39.72]Tongue comes up underneath.
[266:49.03]And you're done.
[266:49.49]I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing here.
[267:04.55]Am I supposed to keep exploring?
[267:15.12]Okay.
[267:15.72]Okay.
[267:16.88]One last time.
[267:17.50]I'm going to go quick this time.
[267:21.28]We went slow last time.
[267:22.08]I'm going to go quick for you.
[267:26.40]Ready.
[267:28.03]Package.
[267:28.53]Out.
[267:29.05]Fourscape.
[267:29.53]Great.
[267:30.15]Fourscape.
[267:31.03]Out.
[267:31.89]Okay.
[267:37.03]End up.
[267:38.45]Disintegrate.
[267:47.48]What do I do?
[267:53.46]Get back in the machine?
[267:56.52]What was the last task that you had us do?
[267:58.14]I don't know.
[268:18.90]I think we have to go over here.
[268:26.32]What is happening?
[268:31.59]Have I lost all control?
[268:34.17]Probably did.
[268:50.73]Get back into the action.
[268:54.25]Elevator?
[268:54.81]I was just in the elevator and I couldn't do anything.
[269:03.80]Hold select.
[269:04.42]Did that just say photograph?

[269:57.67]It's not a person's office.
[270:01.35]Fuck, I really didn't eat all of them.
[270:02.82]Is that a gun?
[270:05.30]No, it's a phone.
[270:09.74]Ooh, the spooky swivel chair.
[270:14.08]Oh, now my, like, my stomach hurts.
[270:16.85]That was like a... Alright, no, nothing, nothing, nothing I hear.
[270:26.49]Something weird.
[270:31.44]What's wrong with him?
[270:35.50]What's wrong with my guy?
[270:59.43]It's one of those sound emitters, but where the hell is it?
[271:01.84]Okay, fine.
[271:07.96]A hundred.
[271:11.44]Radiator?
[271:17.27]Is it behind the picture?
[271:18.85]I think it's behind the picture.
[271:22.29]It is.
[271:25.86]Alright, well.
[271:27.80]One way to do it.
[271:32.68]Still have not found this guy's office.
[271:39.80]Is this his office?
[271:42.52]No, this is the first telephone gun.
[271:43.94]I feel like I have chocolate all over my face.
[271:57.88]So, I didn't locate this person's office yet.
[272:03.97]Let's go.
[272:04.31]Let's see.
[272:04.77]This is... This is Ron Patterson.
[272:13.50]Luis Griffin.
[272:18.54]I bet you this is him.
[272:19.34]It's the only NPC up here.
[272:21.34]Ike Farrell.
[272:31.06]Come in.
[272:31.66]Sit down, Mr. Thomas.
[272:33.42]Can I get you anything?
[272:34.34]Yeah.
[272:36.88]Five aspirins and a shot of soda water.
[272:40.00]I don't think we... Forget it.
[272:42.76]Take a seat.
[272:43.68]Mr. Thomas, please sit so we can get started.
[272:48.58]Okay, let's begin.
[272:49.54]I'll be asking you questions regarding the recovery mission of Malcolm Van Horn.
[272:55.64]Please answer them to the best of your ability.
[272:58.46]Are you ready to begin?
[273:00.95]Ready as I'll ever be I'm ready.
[273:02.83]All right What happened immediately after leaving the hotel?
[273:10.17]Now I have to do a quiz We fled the scene We carried Van Horn's body away We were waiting for the cops or we carried Van Horn's body away from the hotel.
[273:19.76]We carried Van Horn's body away from the hotel.
[273:21.66]I remember the goofy double wheelbarrow I remember that.
[273:23.50]Was LaRue with the group at the time?
[273:25.87]What happened next?
[273:26.39]A commuter train collided with a power transformer.
[273:28.97]And that's when you were separated from the team, jeopardizing the success of the mission.
[273:49.97]Grill.
[273:50.19]You should know that Special Agent Dorland is missing.
[273:53.19]He picked up Agent LaRue a few blocks from the hotel.
[273:57.15]I'm sorry.
[273:57.71]I don't know anything.
[273:59.11]Am I sure I didn't turn this shit off?
[274:00.45]Uh...
[274:18.58]I was in a doll factory.
[274:19.40]I was in an old doll factory.
[274:21.60]Apparently that's not right.
[274:22.34]Explain what happened once Van Horn was secured.
[274:24.34]Helicopter started taking fire.
[274:27.56]The helicopter had to readjust due to power lines.
[274:30.22]Helicopter took off.
[274:30.97]The helicopter took off.
[274:33.53]Who ordered the pilot to leave the team behind?
[274:37.27]I did.
[274:39.27]Now this next question is very important, Mr. Thomas.
[274:43.58]Why did the team split up?
[274:46.36]Whoa.
[274:46.60]You gave Dorland, Royland, you gave Dorland, Justin, Royland, Royland, Dorland.
[275:05.08]Dorlan.
[275:05.92]Dorlan.
[275:07.02]It was a misunderstanding.
[275:08.44]A misunderstanding?
[275:09.69]I almost got killed.
[275:11.17]Sit down.
[275:11.95]Fuck you.
[275:13.33]I'm ordering you to sit down.
[275:15.65]Jesus Christ, just shoot me and get it over with.
[275:21.45]Why did you bring me back?
[275:23.61]You knew, Van Horn, what to look for.
[275:28.40]Just another stiff.
[275:29.94]Why the risky mission?
[275:31.44]It was important.
[275:32.84]We control the situation.
[275:38.13]Cooperation, Mr. Thomas.
[275:41.73]That's all I wanted.
[275:43.72]Cooperation?
[275:45.36]Then what?
[275:45.84]Kill me?
[275:46.18]No.
[275:51.06]They remove the motion blur.
[275:54.92]Take that call.
[276:22.49]Just masturbating.
[276:24.45]Sorry.
[276:24.79]That's two.
[276:25.35]That's two shit jokes in a row.
[276:27.71]If you keep track.
[276:51.77]That's two awful pieces of humor in a row.
[276:56.72]Write them down.
[276:57.48]Keep a tally.
[276:58.92]I'd like to know what they are at the end of the stream.
[277:01.35]Do you agree?
[277:01.75]Did you get immortality?
[277:04.19]What were those immortality boots?
[277:12.15]What do we got?
[277:13.65]Skin peeled away, strips of muscle torn from bone, and her head is missing.
[277:17.15]Actual cause of death is unknown.
[277:19.39]Not Jamaican ID.
[277:20.15]She doesn't have a head.
[277:21.24]She was wearing this badge.
[277:24.94]Her head's been removed.
[277:26.18]I have no idea how she's dead, though.
[277:28.48]It's weird, isn't it?
[277:29.42]A human without a fucking head.
[277:32.02]Expect a maelstrom any minute.
[277:37.91]Someone knows.
[277:39.30]First Van Horn, and now... Keep your voice down.
[277:46.26]Agent Thomas?
[277:47.58]Mr. Thomas.
[277:49.18]I found this on the body.
[277:50.34]Is that a lunchbox?
[277:54.73]I don't know.
[277:56.43]I didn't see it very well.
[277:59.65]Mr. Thomas, take a look around.
[278:02.41]Dolan and I are heading back to the agency.
[278:08.16]remember our discussion I'm trying to protect you get this to agent rosa scu asap I'll have it delivered right away how long is condemned to can we finish it in one more stream what do you think was it like seven hours eight hours

[278:53.20]When the hell did I stream this game for that long what we've been doing Come on more stream
[279:05.74]Well, we did condemn one in two screams.
[279:14.38]There's too little blood.
[279:15.38]It should be splattered all over the place.
[279:17.32]Here comes the investigation.
[279:18.40]Hmm.
[279:19.81]What does the blood pattern look like?
[279:24.51]Did she fall down and hit her face?
[279:26.53]Where did the axe come down?
[279:27.67]Is this a, is this a rectical, rectical splatter or is this an aerial splatter?
[279:35.15]Determine where the wheelbarrow came from.
[279:40.03]Lowe's.
[279:40.39]Let me scan the barcode.
[279:47.20]Can't buy a wheelbarrow on Amazon, so... That's one thing that Amazon doesn't have.
[279:54.40]Can't buy wood.
[279:56.22]Can't buy wheelbarrows.
[279:58.54]Can't buy giant planes of glass.
[280:02.20]They'll never win.
[280:03.34]They'll never take on Home Depot and win.
[280:05.70]They'll never take on Lowe's.
[280:07.78]You have to go to Goodwill.
[280:08.54]You're gonna get like a bunch of PVC pipe from Amazon and your two-day fucking Amazon two-day shipping?
[280:12.48]No.
[280:15.16]Not gonna happen.
[280:21.52]Where did the wheelbarrow come from?
[280:26.50]Tire.
[280:28.34]Tire to door.
[280:29.26]Tire to box.
[280:32.41]I don't know.
[280:33.15]Tire to box?
[280:36.77]You can buy wheelbarrows on Amazon.
[280:38.53]But the cheap ones.
[280:40.95]I'm clicking this.
[280:41.93]What is this?
[280:43.61]Wheelbarrow.
[280:46.51]Now this is the cheap shi- This is the- Excuse me.
[280:49.75]This is the wheelbarrow that you drag along like your son in.
[280:54.52]This is the kind of wheelbarrow, the Amazon wheelbarrows you're referring to here, are out on Halloween trick-or-treating, and there's three little children inside of this barrel, that wheelbarrow, and we're dragging it along.
[281:08.55]That's a transport, child transport, happy Halloween trick-or-treat box.
[281:13.39]That's not a working man's wheelbarrow.
[281:17.26]That's not, you know, like a... Like a fucking cigar in your mouth.
[281:20.35]A cigarette in your fucking... Lifting up, like, heavy shit.
[281:23.68]You got, like, mulch in there.
[281:24.88]That's not the same.
[281:35.25]You can't get one of these, like, wheelbarrows from Amazon.
[281:38.65]You can't.
[281:40.67]Even if you can, it's probably extremely overpriced.
[281:43.53]You can't get two-day shipping on it.
[281:45.81]If you can, that's fine.
[281:47.60]How are you going to build a house?
[281:49.82]Where are your tools?
[282:03.97]Where's your John Deere?
[282:05.05]You're going to mow the lawn?
[282:05.77]You're going to buy a lawnmower from Amazon?
[282:08.58]Not going to happen.
[282:09.58]Can you buy a fucking... Rider lawnmower.
[282:18.86]Amazon.
[282:21.44]No way.
[282:28.07]Yeah, the Amazon sells riding lawnmowers.
[282:32.11]How?
[282:32.73]How do you get this?
[282:35.68]How do you get shipped a fucking, can you buy a car on Amazon?
[282:40.06]This is a car.
[282:43.52]How do you get it?
[282:52.06]They can't ship that to you in a box?
[283:00.07]They ship it to you.
[283:08.07]Follow tire marks.
[283:09.37]Left by the wheelbarrow.
[283:11.75]Wheelbarrow.
[283:12.85]Not wheelbarrow.
[283:14.29]I hate that.
[283:17.55]Wheelbarrow.
[283:20.19]It's a wheelbarrow.
[283:25.46]They go to here.
[283:26.18]They go from here to here.
[283:31.42]Then we're inside the box.
[283:33.64]Hey!
[283:34.04]What's inside the Amazon box?
[283:35.32]Is it a lawnmower?
[283:58.53]Too many lawn mowers in here.
[284:02.25]It goes on one track, so follow the tracks.
[284:06.17]I did.
[284:06.61]And now what?
[284:11.15]The cop.
[284:12.85]The cop has nothing.
[284:16.61]Whose office is this?
[284:21.52]Did he just- did he just ten finger- did he just like ten fingers salute me over a wall?
[284:29.65]Inside of a wall?
[284:47.46]Use only fists when fighting guards.
[284:49.24]Once a guard is in a defeated state, grab him by the neck to snap it.
[284:54.76]You got it.
[285:00.99]Just don't get caught.
[285:02.55]Easier said than done.
[285:03.29]I thought that was a gun.
[285:03.91]I was about to just take it.
[285:04.65]Let's go this way.
[285:14.95]And a ten-finger salute.
[285:15.99]You go like this.
[285:18.61]Like that.
[285:20.79]And then when they go over, you go... One finger.
[285:25.53]One hand.
[285:26.13]Ethan, this is Rosa.
[285:27.73]I just received that little present you sent me.
[285:30.50]It's a bit disturbing to think that SKX is still alive.
[285:32.78]Found it.
[285:34.36]Last time I saw that psycho... What the fuck?
[285:36.90]What was that?
[285:37.34]Well, the body was never recovered, so I guess the chance he survived was always there.
[285:40.96]You can buy an airplane on Amazon.
[285:43.48]Shut up.
[285:44.44]Mr. Thomas, the coroner just arrived.
[285:46.56]He's examining the body now.
[285:48.80]That's the movie airplane.
[285:50.68]That's airplane the movie.
[285:59.49]Got it.
[286:01.43]Just need to take a picture of it, right?
[286:07.81]There's the fucking secret clam.
[286:18.81]Does that mean anything?
[286:23.26]No idea.
[286:26.08]Well, let's just run through.
[286:27.36]Walking quiet.
[286:28.20]To walk quietly, push slightly on the L. What about the door?
[286:38.38]Oh, this is the night of the museum.
[286:42.66]Can't wait for Ben Stiller to come out and be like, Hey, I mean, what are you doing here?
[286:47.18]Hey, hey.
[286:50.70]No!
[286:51.48]No!
[286:51.96]No!
[286:54.82]Every night assholes break in here and start stealing shit.
[286:57.51]Seems to be getting worse.
[286:58.45]I bet one of us will get it tonight if we're not careful.
[287:00.67]The hell's going on around here?
[287:05.06]I mean the goddamn mayor's lying dead in the next room and no one saw a thing?
[287:16.75]Stupid restricting us to just these nightsticks company policy my ass Hey guys Not even saying anything I killed him did I kill him I Think it's too late.
[287:39.38]I think I already failed it
[287:46.31]Ooh, no, he's definitely dead.
[287:47.65]No, he's definitely dead.
[287:48.69]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[287:54.43]I'm gonna throw this in the air and catch it.
[287:59.58]What?
[288:08.01]Oh god.
[288:09.35]Don't these guys have guns?
[288:19.94]This is not very security guard-like.
[288:31.92]I don't want to... I'm not supposed to kill these guys.
[288:35.84]Alright.
[288:38.93]What do I do?
[288:49.95]Okay, this is what we know so far.
[289:02.97]The victim is Mayor Rachel Marks, age 55, found dead inside the City Museum of Natural History.
[289:09.07]Body has severe lacerations about the back, chest, and arms, resulting in excessive hemorrhaging.
[289:14.72]There's also an extensive tearing of muscle and ligament within the same region.
[289:18.11]That's like real pictures.
[289:18.85]Head decapitated just above the collarbone.
[289:21.39]Whereabouts is still unknown.
[289:24.09]Alright, and now for the note you sent me.
[289:26.74]Found on the victim's body was a piece of paper with strangely drawn eyes on one side, and on the other, the acronym of a serial killer known as Serial Killer X. By far.
[289:42.16]What's the most expensive item you can purchase on Amazon?
[289:50.21]I would love to play multiplayer if any of you guys had it.
[289:53.13]But I think it's GameSpy.
[289:54.29]GameSpy went under a long time ago, right?
[289:59.84]They turned off all the servers in the greater metro area.
[290:03.98]Like, five to ten years ago.
[290:05.34]Tesla X with $115,000.
[290:05.74]A Rolex.
[290:05.94]Yeah, I can see, like, jewelry.
[290:07.46]It's not jewelry, though.
[290:08.94]I guessed on everything and I got it perfect.
[290:10.15]Doesn't even matter.
[290:10.91]Hmm.
[290:25.62]SKX turns on his uncle and kills him.
[290:28.16]For perhaps the same reason he murders Rachel Mars.
[290:32.42]I'm searching the museum.
[290:33.74]We need more information.
[290:42.99]Was it?
[290:43.75]Couldn't really tell what I just did, right?
[290:45.01]It's not my first rodeo.
[290:49.38]Photograph the saw.
[290:51.22]Okay.
[291:03.66]Old movie posters for big money?
[291:05.24]$750,000.
[291:05.26]Wow.
[291:05.42]See?
[291:05.70]He didn't even know what I did.
[291:07.24]I think I'm pretty good at it.
[291:09.38]I've gotten pretty good at it, I must say.
[291:17.87]Excellent.
[291:33.17]Perfect.
[291:33.45]Farted?
[291:33.69]What?
[291:33.81]No, I'm suppressing yawns.
[291:37.41]We talked about this like 30 minutes ago.
[291:38.58]Oh, yeah, farted.
[291:39.12]Yeah, no, this guy farted.
[291:39.74]No, I was suppressing a yawn.
[291:41.10]It's going to happen again.
[292:03.57]What about the saw?
[292:04.59]You said it looked evil?
[292:06.67]Three hours ago?
[292:07.49]That was like nine, thirty-four years ago.
[292:11.95]I'm so, so fucking tired.
[292:15.45]Find the exhibit that tool came from.
[292:17.72]SKS was certainly there at one point.
[292:22.06]I'm gonna follow the footprints here.
[292:27.00]Follow the wheel.
[292:30.16]I'll find it.
[292:32.11]I really hope one of these dinosaurs comes and fights me.
[292:35.99]That would be incredible.
[292:39.61]Go to sleep.
[292:40.07]I'm going to be ending the stream here soon.
[292:42.87]Once we go over about... We're about five hours.
[292:44.88]We will continue tomorrow.
[292:48.90]I need to sleep.
[292:50.98]I woke up at... 5 a.m.
[292:56.38]today.
[292:58.76]So, I'm getting to that point where I really need to go to bed.
[293:05.80]What am I looking for?
[293:10.21]Locate tool exhibit.
[293:13.27]Are we talking like... Are we talking like... Not sure.
[293:14.99]Could be either... I'd be okay with either one.
[293:32.30]No.
[293:39.34]Nobody gets that?
[293:41.93]Some of you guys have to get that.
[293:45.13]There's gotta be at least a few people in here that get that.
[293:47.51]And if you don't, then only 90s kids will know.
[293:57.26]Only 90s kids.
[293:58.30]Ha ha.
[293:59.62]Ha ha ha.
[294:06.49]I got it.
[294:06.89]I just don't think it's funny.
[294:12.33]Touche.
[294:16.73]Toolshed?
[294:17.51]Exit to the toolshed.
[294:23.12]I was born in 94.
[294:23.74]Am I a 90s kid?
[294:24.62]You're a fucking 90s kid unless you were born in like the 80s and you grew up in the 90s.
[294:32.20]Sorry, I got a little heated there.
[294:33.94]People talk about if they're a 90s kid or not.
[294:48.44]This is the tool shop.
[294:51.85]Damn, yikes.
[294:53.59]Sorry.
[294:56.15]I'm just kidding.
[295:07.67]I'm in his 60s.
[295:09.15]Were 80s kids born in the 70s?
[295:12.53]Yeah, you have to have at least been able to determine... Alright, so if you were born in, like, seven... Alright, you know what?
[295:17.79]Here's what we're gonna do.
[295:21.01]We're gonna pick this up tomorrow, because I'm getting fucking tired.
[295:23.83]I'm getting really tired, actually.
[295:27.18]I know I'm going in circles.
[295:28.14]That's how it happens when I get tired.
[295:29.72]We're gonna end it here.
[295:31.88]We're just under five hours in.
[295:34.62]I'm gonna make this last statement before we go.
[295:39.06]um this is I'm having fun this is definitely like a fun game I just think that I like the first one more but so if you were when you say but people say like oh 80s kids or 90s kids right if you were born in like 1995 for instance or 1996
[296:00.74]You were like three when the 90s were almost over.
[296:07.18]You were born in like 1986, 88.
[296:09.31]Like I'm 85.
[296:12.35]I'm not an 80s kid.
[296:15.01]Not at all.
[296:15.71]But by the time like the 80s were done and we moved on to the 90s, I was like four.
[296:19.21]I was like three years old.
[296:20.71]So I couldn't develop any interests or grow up with anything that was in the 80s because I was too young.
[296:29.49]So I say, you gotta be at least like four, five, six years old at the beginning of that new cycle, that new decade cycle, before you can say that you're a quote kid.
[296:43.31]So if you're a 2000s kid, that means you were born in like 95, 96, 97.
[296:47.55]Bing, bang, boom, you get to 2000, you're like four years old.
[296:53.25]What's this?
[296:54.29]What's that?
[296:54.89]Oh my God.
[296:55.97]What's this new thing?
[296:56.89]It's called a cell phone?
[296:58.49]Wow, hello?
[297:00.39]Yes, it's me.
[297:01.71]Wow, we connected.
[297:03.03]We can connect.
[297:03.81]The internet?
[297:05.15]www.aol.com?
[297:06.91]What's that thing?
[297:07.67]Wow, interests.
[297:08.99]I didn't get that.
[297:09.99]See, I grew up with, like, calling collect.
[297:13.05]So, I didn't do collect calls.
[297:15.76]My father used to fucking hate it.
[297:18.02]I would call my father collect every day.
[297:20.82]It probably costed him, it probably cost my parents 30 bucks a month calling collect.
[297:28.95]you pick up the fucking phone pay phone by the way pay phone 1-800-COLLECT they had to confirm that you to get the charges they had to confirm the phone call so I'd call because I wanted to get picked up from school and I didn't have any money so I would call my father collect and I'd be like please say your name and I'd be like dad it's Jeremy oh and he would receive it and it'd be like you've received a call from
[297:58.41]Dad, it's Jeremy.
[298:00.01]And he'd be like, you little shit.
[298:02.09]Like, don't call collect.
[298:05.24]Anyways.
[298:10.74]98 is a double zero, kid.
[298:12.04]I would agree.
[298:16.98]Dial down.
[298:17.96]Yeah, it was just 1-800-C-O-L-L-E-C-T.
[298:21.97]What happens if you do that now?
[298:30.08]Let's find out.
[298:31.93]1-800-Collect.
[298:32.49]See what this is.
[298:51.59]Thank you for calling 1-800-Collect.
[298:55.39]It's real.
[298:59.69]This still exists?
[299:08.50]What if I'm gonna call my dad collect right now?
[299:11.66]Oh my god, he'd lose his fucking mind.
[299:14.24]No, it's too late.
[299:15.28]I would have just called my father collect right now.
[299:19.10]And he would have been just like in a time warp.
[299:21.59]He'd be like, where am I?
[299:24.17]What's happening?
[299:24.79]What's happening to my life?
[299:26.05]Where's my son?
[299:26.49]Where's my son?
[299:32.47]No, I'm not collect calling anybody.
[299:37.55]It's like, it's midnight.
[299:38.73]I can't do it.
[299:39.99]He's been asleep for like four and a half hours.
[299:41.77]He's an old man.
[299:45.73]No, that's... I'm out.
[299:47.49]I'm out.
[299:48.59]I'm out.
[299:51.64]Call him.
[299:52.20]Collect tomorrow.
[299:54.70]That's gonna be expensive as shit.
[300:02.36]Well, anywho.
[300:05.28]Thank you all so much for watching this Thursday evening stream.
[300:14.50]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[300:16.74]We'll pick this back up.
[300:17.88]We'll try to at least get close to going through.
[300:20.92]We stopped a lot of times.
[300:22.41]We didn't really get that far into the game.
[300:24.03]There was a lot of distractions.
[300:27.17]But that's fine.
[300:28.21]I'm having a good time.
[300:28.83]I'm having fun.
[300:31.69]I'm going to catch up with some of the bits from earlier.
[300:33.68]If you're sticking around, cool.
[300:39.52]If not, then thanks for hanging out.
[300:42.04]See you tomorrow.
[300:44.71]So let me go back to where I left off, which was right here.
[300:58.24]Yeah, this sounds... This looks like a good spot to be.
[301:01.28]Yeah, right here.
[301:03.33]So, from a while back, Bloji with $1.
[301:07.41]Thank you, Bloji.
[301:08.89]Hey, German, just wanted to share these bits with you in celebration because I'm getting a raise.
[301:12.99]My boss said the only conditions are that I have to get you to eat a kid cuisine live on stream.
[301:18.79]Fine.
[301:20.49]Fine.
[301:22.49]Thanks for the $1.
[301:24.27]I'll eat a kid cuisine on stream.
[301:27.70]Can I talk shit about it?
[301:29.44]Can I make fun of it the whole time?
[301:30.62]Can I talk about how it's bad for you?
[301:33.30]Fine, I'll do it.
[301:34.24]That's fine.
[301:35.28]Not tomorrow, but... I don't have any plans to go to the grocery store tomorrow.
[301:39.67]But yes, I will eat a kid cuisine on stream.
[301:45.05]And then immediately get diarrhea.
[301:49.04]Gaming Gumshoes, thanks for the $10.

[302:03.49]And... I don't know.
[302:07.39]We'll see what happens next.

[302:18.72]That means a lot.
[302:20.84]Gaming Trickster, thanks for the $1.
[302:22.42]Hey, Jerma, can you read this out loud?
[302:24.14]Uh, no.
[302:27.86]I already told you guys, you can't pay, you can't drop money in bits, and when I go over them, I'm not gonna, you can't say, hey, Jerma, read this, because that immediately makes me not want to read it, because I'm just like, what am I getting into here?
[302:41.67]What am I about to read?
[302:42.59]But thank you, nonetheless.
[302:50.23]uh eefs thank you for the 10 bucks welcome back eefs I know I say that two ways every time hey german just want to say thank you for the entertainment tonight it's been a year since I donated bone marrow to someone close to me and it's a weird night so thank you for cheering me up laughs well that's bone donating bone marrow is
[303:13.83]That's pretty brave shit, man.
[303:16.73]Isn't it, like, very painful?
[303:18.23]And isn't it, like, an extremely invasive process to extract bone marrow?
[303:23.89]So that's incredibly awesome of you.
[303:30.10]Yeah.
[303:33.56]Yeah, because they really gotta get in there, right?
[303:36.34]It's fucking painful, I can imagine.
[303:40.10]But yeah, that's a total thumbs up to you, man.
[303:45.59]Thank you for the ten bucks.
[303:48.78]Sly161, thanks for the two bucks.
[303:52.30]Warhammer came out first in, like, the 80s, Jerma, please.
[303:56.98]Wait, what do you mean Warhammer came out first?
[304:00.97]Sorry, Chris Metzen wrote Warcraft Orcs and Humans in, like, 1993, 1994.
[304:05.45]And Warhammer...
[304:10.43]The Dawn of Mankind came out in 1988.
[304:13.75]You do the math.
[304:17.77]It was a direct inspiration.
[304:22.61]Thank you for the $2, though.
[304:24.53]Reaper500, thanks for the 500 bits.
[304:26.37]Thanks for the $5.
[304:29.17]Somebody said, well, first of all, somebody in the chat just said, shit in a urinal next stream.
[304:34.20]No, I don't want to get arrested.
[304:37.30]So, no.
[304:39.20]Reaper, thanks for the five bucks.
[304:40.45]Hey, German, just want to say that you have been on fire lately with comedy.
[304:46.43]Have I, though?
[304:46.93]I feel like it's been kind of the opposite the last, like, five streams.
[304:51.17]Well, maybe not five.
[304:52.97]Maybe, like, one.
[304:53.77]Maybe, like, four.
[304:54.51]I don't know.
[304:55.33]I've lost track.
[304:56.94]I say comedy instead of jokes because sometimes it's funnier when the joke fails like when Twitch chat eliminated you instead of... See?
[305:04.23]See, you get it.
[305:06.03]When Twitch chat eliminated you instead of immediately being eliminated like you planned.
[305:11.87]So I just wanted to give you a little love.
[305:13.81]Instead of VI, I think that's a... Twitch alerts kind of ate your message here at the end.
[305:19.46]But... Thank you, Reaper.
[305:21.44]Appreciate it.
[305:23.74]I'm glad you think it's... I'm glad you think it's funny.
[305:29.54]Sometimes I just like to talk It's very very humbling to know That somebody thinks you're funny So I'm gonna keep trying my best And that's all I can do Thank you also to Miko Miko-tsu Really wanted all of my friend's hemorrhoids That he told you about are better I just thought you should know
[305:59.01]That's really good to know.
[306:00.25]Because those were awful.
[306:01.21]And they were paying the ass.
[306:02.61]Literally, figuratively, and... Financially.
[306:06.73]All of them.
[306:08.51]Wish your friend... The best of luck, for sure.
[306:13.52]Peaceful Haley.
[306:14.40]Thanks for the $1.
[306:15.28]Hi, Jeremy.
[306:15.76]I'm very sad tonight.
[306:16.62]Can you make me laugh, please?
[306:19.18]Unfortunately, this was like an hour and a half ago.
[306:22.63]So, uh... You don't think I fixed my mic?
[306:27.57]Wait, what?
[306:29.41]Yeah, I did.
[306:30.74]Oh, wait a minute.
[306:32.52]No, I didn't.
[306:33.96]No, I did not.
[306:36.20]My mic is not fixed.
[306:39.10]At all, actually.
[306:41.88]It's the complete opposite.
[306:46.32]And there we go.
[306:49.72]This has been like this for almost an hour.
[306:56.70]Okay, well, that's fixed.
[307:01.27]It just didn't sound right.
[307:02.49]That's funny.
[307:06.28]Well, PeacefulHaley, I don't have very much to say at the moment.
[307:09.76]Hopefully at some point in that hour, you got some joy.
[307:15.96]Yellow, thank you, YellowKuru, for the $1.00.

[307:31.40]Please play Trance by Sound System 009.
[307:35.78]Is that like a song?
[307:39.82]Should I have played that during my webcam fiasco?
[307:45.01]That's okay.
[307:45.39]You've made me laugh.

[308:04.91]You're not going to pay me to say anything.
[308:07.35]You're not going to pay me to put any songs on.
[308:09.15]You're not going to pay me to play a video.
[308:10.51]And you're not going to pay me to play any video games.
[308:13.13]You're not going to pay me to say anything.
[308:14.59]You're not going to pay me to do anything.
[308:17.25]You're not going to pay me to play your favorite song.
[308:19.61]You're not going to pay me to talk.
[308:24.88]Let me just go ahead and name all things that I currently do.
[308:34.72]The Spaceballs clip was free.
[308:38.60]I love it.
[308:39.49]So it is broke.
[308:40.39]What?
[308:41.63]An independent... I don't need any... An independent... I'm an independent streamer, okay?
[308:48.93]I take it back.
[308:49.51]Please love me.
[308:51.29]Thank you to Techno.
[308:53.99]Techno Toast for the $2.
[308:54.91]Deep fried Jerma streaming from 2005 YouTube is my favorite joke you've ever made.
[309:02.13]And made me cry laughing.
[309:03.21]Thank you, I love this.
[309:06.03]We all remember those channels.
[309:07.34]So... It's... It's definitely in the noggin for all of us.
[309:16.00]I used to make videos that were... Like, I thought 720p was out of reach when I was first making videos.
[309:24.21]That was a huge deal for me.
[309:26.35]I'm uploading at 720p, dude.
[309:29.41]With like a 3,000 bitrate.
[309:33.05]I'm never going to be able to do more than this.
[309:35.54]And then six years later, here we are.
[309:37.00]I'm streaming at like 4,300.
[309:40.80]Constant, so.
[309:41.66]The world has changed a lot, that's for sure.
[309:51.08]But thank you.
[309:53.36]Where did this go?
[309:56.42]I lost one.
[309:57.65]Why?
[310:00.49]Chromonite, thank you for the five dollars.
[310:02.23]Chromonite006.
[310:02.63]Dermot, I can still see your nose hairs.
[310:06.13]I gotta trim them.
[310:07.91]I usually do.
[310:08.37]I have a device that I shove up my nose and it goes like and chops them all up.
[310:13.90]It's a handheld device that you put in your nose.
[310:17.02]I do that usually before like an event or if I'm going out somewhere so I don't look like a disgusting human.
[310:23.08]As opposed to a non-human.
[310:27.73]But, yeah.
[310:28.11]It feels nice.
[310:28.95]It does feel nice when you take care of it.
[310:32.13]Manscaping.
[310:34.03]In quotes.
[310:36.53]Thank you, Knuckles.
[310:37.25]056 for the $1.
[310:39.53]What the fuck is going on in this stream?
[310:41.72]I think that was during the... Yeah, that was during the debacle with the webcam.
[310:48.66]Thank you, though, Knuckles.
[310:51.61]Uh, pin?
[310:53.41]What the fuck is happening?
[310:54.57]Yeah, I love how these are trickling in during that whole thing.

[311:01.71]Bob Jack sitting, thanks for the three dollars.
[311:04.41]See, this is, this is gold, but there's a, gold is in brackets.

[311:13.26]But anyways, thank you for the three bucks.
[311:15.87]Uh, Devakitty, thanks for the $1.
[311:17.46]Good job getting this far in the game, Jeremy, after playing for 167 hours.
[311:20.84]Come on, I take my time in games.
[311:25.45]I want to get my money's worth.
[311:26.99]Did you see how much of a money's worth guy kind of I am?
[311:29.53]I bought a GameStop controller, not a PS3 controller.
[311:35.64]See, I'll do this.
[311:36.60]This is the crazy thing, right?
[311:39.27]I'll do this.
[311:40.25]I will buy a GameStop controller for $11 and be like, oh, no, no, no, I'm not going to spend that kind of money.
[311:48.93]No way.
[311:50.67]But then I will drop like $100 on these.
[312:02.41]And I don't know, I wear these like ironically sometimes.
[312:08.71]I've spent so much money on such dumb shit that my brain locks in on some random things.
[312:17.97]$11.
[312:18.29]And I will spend hundreds of dollars on other dumb shit.
[312:24.37]I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.
[312:26.83]Plenty of things, but yeah.
[312:29.59]That's the way it is.

[312:54.84]I feel like it was a disaster, and I want to hear it.
[312:56.93]I want to watch a couple clips before I go to bed, just to see what it actually sounded like.
[313:01.37]But thanks for the two bucks, man.
[313:03.53]Yeah, that's the whole joke, because I may as well have smashed my head into a wall, because I'm like, duh, what happened?
[313:11.36]Just talking and saying words in the wrong order?
[313:15.78]Smitty, thank you, SmittyW, for $15.
[313:19.48]Easily $500 joke, but this is all I got.
[313:22.58]It's very much appreciated.

[313:32.25]Did I say heart, LambLamb?
[313:36.67]Thank you.
[313:38.99]Devakitty, again, with the $1.
[313:41.49]Hey, Jeremy, my mommy let me borrow her credit card and pay you this.
[313:50.65]That's not a nice thing to do.
[313:52.07]Make sure you tell your mother what you're doing with your credit card.
[313:54.95]You've got to ask parents' permission.
[313:56.87]By the way, this is a PG-17 stream.
[313:59.28]You've got to be over 18 to be able to watch.
[314:03.40]You're going to have to tell your mother that you're doing something wrong, and then she's going to have to correct it.
[314:09.02]Thank you, Amish Robot, for the $5.
[314:12.43]That was the best joke on the stream to date.
[314:17.13]That makes me happy.
[314:18.51]Thank you Amish Robot.
[314:20.43]Devakitty again with $2.
[314:24.67]Apparently got permission from the mother.
[314:27.75]Just says that was the best stream.
[314:30.63]Thank you.
[314:33.09]Playabig, Danny, thanks for the $1.
[314:34.01]In all seriousness, love the stream.
[314:39.14]Man, you guys are just showing the love tonight.
[314:42.26]Thank you.
[314:44.84]Boozy Cat, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[314:48.93]I've been a fan of your content for a long time.
[314:51.03]I can say that was one of the best bits ever.
[314:53.53]Well, thank you.
[314:54.99]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[314:57.33]You guys are showing so much love to me tonight.
[315:00.53]I'm getting so much love.
[315:02.15]Can I give it back?
[315:03.23]Can I return the love?
[315:05.53]You guys are all fucking awesome.
[315:06.89]Thank you for fucking being here.
[315:08.17]Let me return it to you.
[315:18.35]The way that I feel about making videos and streaming and stuff, it goes back to how I would talk with my friends and act with my friends.
[315:27.62]That's just the way it was.
[315:29.48]We would just fuck around.
[315:32.45]We weren't even like... A lot of friends of mine that I talked to and hang out with and see, we still do that shit.
[315:40.59]We just want to make each other smile and shit.
[315:45.50]Make each other happy, make each other laugh.
[315:47.70]We weren't trying to tell each other jokes, necessarily.
[315:50.80]We just were hanging out.
[315:53.24]And we would come up with something.
[316:00.28]And it's not... No returns, it's a store policy.
[316:08.12]But that's like the same way that I feel when I'm streaming like a game or when I'm hanging out doing like a quote joke.
[316:16.85]It's just trying to hang out and have fun and attempt to create scenarios for each other, right?
[316:23.65]Because obviously I look at the chat and there'll be plenty of things you guys say.
[316:26.59]And I play off that and it's just fun.
[316:30.01]It's a lot of fun.
[316:31.26]I hope you're having fun.
[316:32.66]That's numero uno.
[316:38.35]Mr. Kool-Aid, thank you for the $5.
[316:39.59]I'm physically hurt from how much I was laughing.
[316:43.11]And yes, one go for Reese's.
[316:46.19]Yes, you do it in one bite.
[316:47.57]That's it.
[316:50.85]Only one bite.
[316:51.75]You can't do any more than that.
[316:55.11]Deva Kitty, thanks for the $1.
[316:56.23]Only a fool eats a whole cup.
[316:57.55]No, no, no, no.
[316:58.79]Only a fool takes small bites.
[317:00.27]Because you get the charcoal on your fingers.
[317:06.06]King Cowboy, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[317:09.34]Very much appreciated.
[317:10.18]Jeremiah, I love you and I want you to kiss me.
[317:14.42]We are over the internet, so I can't do that.
[317:18.70]And I don't know you at all.
[317:23.18]So I don't know who you are.
[317:26.02]But I do appreciate the love.
[317:29.45]Thank you so much for the 10 bucks.
[317:32.20]Gaming Trickster, thanks for the $1.
[317:33.92]Raised on a mountain, born in a cave.
[317:36.42]Fucking somebody in a truck.
[317:40.96]Thank you, Benj, for the $5.
[317:43.00]Jeremiah, I'm sleepy.
[317:45.74]Can you give me a goodnight kiss?
[317:47.15]Everybody wants a kissy.
[317:48.85]Everybody wants like a kissy.
[317:51.29]That's two kissies asked for in two minutes.
[317:55.23]Actually, it was an hour.
[317:57.47]This one was like 36 minutes, and this is eight minutes.
[318:00.29]So it was like 30 minutes between those two.
[318:06.13]What the fuck?
[318:08.59]I'm going to copy and paste my previous answer.
[318:12.13]But thank you for the $5.
[318:13.23]Appreciate it, Ben.
[318:15.03]Benj0313.
[318:18.81]And wrapping it up here at the very end here, DubskiDude with $1, Yo Jerma, could I interview you?
[318:24.80]Take about an hour of your time and maybe get the Jerma Reddit to come up with a list of some not-psycho questions.
[318:31.58]Could be a lot of fun and informative.
[318:35.63]Instead of an interview, sometimes, like the Comb stream, for instance, is like a gigantic interview.
[318:44.63]I just sit here sometimes with the camera on and we just talk and anybody can just literally ask anything and I will reply to whatever I deem that I want to talk about at the moment, you know?
[318:57.95]So I don't know about, like, interview.
[319:01.40]I've never done an AMA on Reddit.
[319:05.24]I feel like I could actually just talk and do, like, a two-hour AMA on stream like I've done a couple times before.
[319:14.96]But, you know.
[319:20.43]King Cowboy again.
[319:21.97]Thank you, King Cowboy, for the 15 bucks.
[319:25.43]$15.
[319:25.45]Hey, me again.
[319:26.21]Just wanted to give you more for all the laughs and headaches you've given me throughout the years.
[319:29.81]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[319:30.93]Thank you for the relief.
[319:33.01]Well, first of all, thank you so much for that generous $15, man.
[319:38.29]Second of all, it's actually kind of interesting to hear that
[319:42.57]Hey, man, just want to say thank you for all the laughs and all the headaches you've given me.
[319:46.56]It's like I'm apparently causing you, like, physical pain.
[319:54.66]I appreciate all those laughs.
[319:55.90]And you know, all the headaches.
[319:58.70]You keep giving me fucking illnesses.
[320:01.38]No.
[320:02.46]But... Thank you.
[320:06.40]Much appreciated.
[320:07.52]From the laughter.
[320:09.88]I know, I'm just being...
[320:12.52]Who is Anthony Banthony anyways?
[320:17.19]Remember the Evil Within stream?
[320:19.17]Oh yeah, I do.
[320:21.97]I'd like to... Okay, you know like the Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind where Jim Carrey erases his memory and like, that's about like turning, deleting, going in with a program and deleting a memory?
[320:33.82]If I walked into the doctor's office and I had that kind of power...
[320:38.40]Now, Jeremy, where would you want to go?
[320:40.74]What memory would you like to erase?
[320:43.72]Doctor, can you erase the time when I played The Evil Within 2 for four hours?
[320:48.64]That's what you want to do.
[320:49.70]Yeah.
[320:51.74]You know that this procedure is $680,000.
[320:53.26]Oh, yeah.
[320:54.40]No, I'm aware.
[320:58.98]You haven't seen that movie yet.
[321:01.26]Well, go see it.
[321:05.78]Go see that movie.
[321:07.64]It gets a little weird.
[321:08.40]It gets a little preachy and strange, but I thought it was a good enough movie.
[321:13.75]It was decent.
[321:16.79]And the last, last but not least, McJams.
[321:20.29]Thank you for the one dollar.
[321:22.06]Am I ever going to come to Canada?
[321:27.60]I've been to Canada actually like three or four times.
[321:31.28]I've been to the... I've been to Montreal and then somewhere else that I don't remember.
[321:37.86]I've been to Montreal twice.
[321:41.74]What the hell else did I do?
[321:44.23]I went to one other place in Canada.
[321:45.93]Where was it?
[321:46.33]I don't know.
[321:48.69]Just say Montreal and other areas.
[321:55.19]I drove through Canada to get to Montreal and we stopped somewhere.
[321:58.79]I think that's what it was.
[321:59.59]Yeah.
[322:03.38]What movie were we talking about?
[322:04.68]Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
[322:07.68]It's right in that apex where Jim Carrey decided he didn't want to be a comedian anymore.
[322:13.76]And he wanted to make a bunch of serious movies.
[322:15.52]That was one of the Jim Carrey is a serious actor movies that he did in a row.
[322:21.66]The number 23, Eternal Sunshine.
[322:23.98]I would say Man on the Moon, but he did a great job in Man on the Moon.
[322:28.50]And that was still a comedy, so... But, you know...
[322:33.40]Anyways, good night, everybody.
[322:36.20]I don't know how to drive a stick shift.
[322:39.43]Automatic only.
[322:41.75]Or bust.
[322:47.11]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[322:48.73]We're going to continue probably Condemned 2 unless something... Unless a meteor hits the earth.
[322:53.79]Then we'll be playing Condemned 2.
[322:56.63]Good night.
[322:57.29]Good luck.
[322:58.51]Goodbye.
[322:59.78]Take care.
[323:10.48]you
[323:45.36]you
