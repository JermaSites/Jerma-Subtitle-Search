[00:29.49]Where is it?
[00:29.85]Hype train.
[00:30.29]There it is.
[00:31.63]Okay.
[00:31.85]Okay.
[00:32.05]Okay.
[00:32.31]Okay.
[00:32.91]Okay.
[00:33.25]Hard.
[00:33.93]Make it really hard.
[00:35.17]And make it... 15 events.
[00:39.58]Done.
[00:42.42]Okay.
[00:42.96]Now it's... Now it's very hard to do.
[00:44.64]I just did it right now.
[00:45.34]Okay.
[00:46.90]Good.
[00:51.62]Now I just made it too hard.
[00:54.18]And now he's... He's just starting to scam everybody.
[00:58.97]Oh no, now we're never gonna get a scam train.
[01:03.99]Alright, but anyways, how you guys doing?
[01:06.73]Welcome back.
[01:09.35]Uh, my voice is a little gone today.
[01:12.52]And I just figured out why.
[01:13.90]And I remember the exact moment from yesterday that it happened.
[01:17.88]Um, if you remember, during a portion of the stream yesterday, I did this thing where I screamed without screaming.
[01:28.35]I screamed very loudly, but I didn't scream.
[01:31.13]I cut it off halfway through, and then I came back and screamed louder.
[01:36.21]That's what did it.
[01:37.75]And that's why I sound like this today.
[01:40.19]And last night, too.
[01:43.26]Uh-oh.
[01:43.76]Uh-oh.
[01:44.08]There's only a limited time to earn.
[01:45.56]There's only a limited time to earn exclusive e-boats.
[01:50.38]How hard is it now?
[01:53.76]It's harder to do this.
[01:55.22]I made this harder to do.
[01:57.72]And I increase the amount of events that it takes.
[02:04.51]Everybody get your hands in the air, everybody.
[02:07.17]Everybody, hands in the air.
[02:09.27]Hands up, everybody.
[02:11.37]Here comes up... I was just hitting a Skype train.
[02:18.23]Like, we're all gonna get on Skype.
[02:20.35]Level one completed.
[02:21.95]Excellent work, everybody.
[02:24.17]You did it!
[02:25.19]You got us to level one Skype train.
[02:32.99]Is it actually harder to do now?
[02:34.35]I'm gonna have to increase it a little more.
[02:39.38]What do we got?
[02:40.08]Hold on.
[02:41.04]Hype conductors.
[02:44.12]Hold on.
[02:44.72]Here are your current hype train conductors.
[02:49.71]Ya boi.
[02:50.85]Bitty.
[03:00.07]This is pay to win.
[03:02.85]Look at that, that greedy Grinner is definitely grinning right now.
[03:06.95]But we're gonna do Community Content Night.
[03:09.19]And I know I say night, but it's day.
[03:11.29]But that sounds like shit.
[03:13.59]Community Content Night rolls off the tongue better than Community Content Day.
[03:18.94]Oh, Community Content Day.
[03:20.40]No, Community Content Night.
[03:21.92]That sounds better to me.
[03:23.24]I don't care if it's 11 o'clock in the morning.
[03:25.78]It's gonna be called Community Content Night.
[03:29.27]or let's call it EU, uh, night.
[03:32.66]But, um, because we didn't do one last month,
[03:37.75]I had to break it up because I didn't want to get sort of uh community content exhaustion and I'd want to spend time on people's submissions I want to look at them and talk about them and obviously not have enough time on them I don't want to just dump like 500 images on the screen and go okay okay okay okay okay so we're gonna do uh we're gonna break it up into two
[04:03.25]We're going to do two.
[04:04.89]One right now, and then one next weekend.
[04:08.12]Which, the one next weekend will catch us up over the last, like, 25 days or so.
[04:13.18]30 days.
[04:15.32]What you're seeing here is stuff from November.
[04:18.78]From November into December.
[04:21.87]And there's some good shit here.
[04:23.13]I've seen... Oh, we got a hype train.
[04:25.19]Level 2 completed.
[04:36.24]Where's my lip balm?
[04:37.16]I don't even have any lip balm up here.
[04:38.52]What a mistake.
[04:42.86]It never gets old.
[04:43.94]I pray.
[04:47.69]Put on the lipstick.
[04:48.77]No, I need lip balm.
[04:49.59]I really do.
[04:50.01]If I don't have lip balm, then... Get hype.
[04:54.27]Get hype.
[04:55.13]Hype.
[04:58.49]It's just that it's the bar.
[05:00.79]I figured it out.
[05:03.74]If any time that there is a completable bar, somebody will do it.
[05:09.00]Always.
[05:10.38]It doesn't matter what it is.
[05:13.06]As long as there is a progress bar, it's going to be filled.
[05:20.05]But I see this.
[05:21.31]I'm thinking about just contributing to make the progress go up.
[05:24.17]I have to see the bar go up.
[05:29.98]we're just we're just a bunch of we're just a bunch of mice we're just a bunch of rats like bargo up yeah get eat you oh Lord of the Rings subs oh I I actually do I actually do I I'm gonna I actually really do oh how many
[06:02.23]Look, I don't even remember that.
[06:03.39]I remember like 15 minutes of that 13 hour stream.
[06:06.53]How many subs do I owe?
[06:08.95]It was 40?
[06:09.43]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[06:14.58]Hey, I gotta make this progress go up.
[06:16.48]Alright, hold on.
[06:17.90]Hold on.
[06:19.40]No, that's true.
[06:20.42]That is absolutely true.
[06:23.24]Hold on a second.
[06:34.54]Yeah, because I said if I swung one time, that I owed 10 subs, and I swung like three or four times, right?
[06:41.76]Okay, well, here we go.
[06:43.20]Let me gift subs.
[06:45.22]Give gift subscriptions.
[06:48.78]Give... Can I give more?
[06:53.17]Okay.
[06:53.43]I have to do... Alright, here we go.
[06:54.87]$40.
[06:54.89]$200!
[06:55.05]Just kidding.
[07:00.45]Now, here we go.
[07:01.03]Here comes 40 community subs.
[07:09.64]My mother does this thing.
[07:11.30]It doesn't matter how inexpensive or how expensive something is.
[07:15.09]When she hears the price for it, she repeats the price, shocked and annoyed.
[07:23.39]How much is that?
[07:24.07]How much is that slice of pizza?
[07:25.69]Well, it's $2.80.
[07:26.07]$2.80, Jeremy!
[07:26.85]Yeah, it is.
[07:27.63]Oh, my goodness.
[07:28.15]That better be the best pizza I've ever had in my life.
[07:45.35]Same reaction.
[07:45.97]If that pizza was $200 a slice, it would be the same reaction.
[07:52.72]Alright, let's do this.
[07:53.88]Here we go.
[07:54.96]40 community subs.
[07:57.18]I am a man of my word sometimes.
[08:00.40]I'm making my own hype train go up.
[08:06.97]Wait, that doesn't count?
[08:07.77]Hey!
[08:10.77]Hey!
[08:11.39]How come that doesn't count?
[08:16.41]I can't increase my own- hold on, so you can't just sit there and make your own hype train go off?
[08:29.80]Oh, maybe you should try it again.
[08:30.84]Should I try it again?
[08:32.90]Wait, I ran out of time?
[08:33.93]No, I didn't.
[08:34.57]There's still 3 minutes and 40 seconds left.
[08:37.23]Alright, let's get this started.
[08:38.99]Community content night.
[08:40.07]This is going to be short stream.
[08:41.27]Probably going to be a couple hours, a few hours.
[08:45.80]It's going to be a quick one.
[08:46.66]We're just going to chill, go over some videos, go over some artwork.
[08:54.13]And I do have something to tell you, though.
[08:55.41]Something that you'll like.
[08:58.25]But for those of you that think that when Joel is on a stream, it's the worst stream ever, apparently.
[09:04.37]You know, the two streams that we've done together.
[09:08.17]The first one was nominated for worst stream of the year.
[09:10.83]And the second one was nominated for best stream of the year.
[09:12.70]Because I nominated it for this year.
[09:14.04]Because I loved it.
[09:18.96]Tuesday.
[09:20.64]On Tuesday, we're going to do Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes.
[09:22.70]This time, we're going to switch off.
[09:26.58]We're going to do it a little longer this time, and we'll switch off Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Part 2 on Tuesday.
[09:33.07]Just got the confirmation.
[09:37.52]And...
[09:40.42]Jesus Christ.
[09:42.86]Hype train has been completed because not to be overshadowed by my 40 community subs, but it's just me.
[09:54.25]Alright, here's something.
[09:55.95]Hold on.
[09:57.11]Alright, listen.
[09:58.95]50 community subs just came in from Zyxia.
[10:05.07]50.
[10:05.11]That's right.
[10:05.47]That's 5-0.
[10:06.21]50 fucking subs.
[10:07.98]Every concurrent viewer
[10:11.19]is potentially going to be subscribed to this channel.
[10:14.69]It's at some point.
[10:16.35]If you stick around for long enough and you come to most streams, you're going to get a subscription.
[10:21.48]This shit just is out of control.
[10:27.12]Right?
[10:27.26]Like, I mean, mathematically, how much longer can there be, like, 200 to 300 community subs every stream?
[10:34.70]Like, see what I'm saying?
[10:36.40]See what I'm saying?
[10:37.35]This is a 69.
[10:37.67]69 subs.
[10:43.43]From phylactery.
[10:48.81]Jesus, guys.
[10:50.15]Oh, my God.
[10:54.41]And they give the 69 number every time.
[10:56.73]Level 5 completed.
[10:57.53]It's over.
[10:57.83]We did it.
[10:58.19]And I made it harder.
[10:58.91]Alright, I'm gonna make this impossible next time.
[11:08.52]I guess I could just, like... I guess I could just, like, turn it off.
[11:13.08]Right?
[11:17.15]Anyways, that's huge fucking money from both of you guys.
[11:20.82]Thanks for the 56 of you.
[11:23.34]And 69 community subs from Phylactery.
[11:27.16]But what I was saying is whenever a streamer gives community subs to their own stream, they're just deleting a percentage of money.
[11:41.93]You know what I mean?
[11:42.39]It's just like, here you go, guys.
[11:44.03]Here's 50 community stuff.
[11:46.40]I just deleted money.
[11:48.88]It's just gone.
[11:53.02]That's like throwing pennies away.
[11:55.70]You know what I mean?
[11:56.18]Don't do that.
[11:56.70]Don't throw a nickel in the trash.
[11:59.87]What the hell are you doing?
[12:08.83]You're crashing the economy.
[12:13.39]You're just paying Twitch, yeah.
[12:17.45]I just said that paying Twitch money was throwing money in the trash.
[12:20.10]Uh-oh.
[12:24.00]That's probably not the best choice of words.
[12:32.23]Ladies and gentlemen, twitch.tv.
[12:34.55]If you want to hang out and have fun, remember, I'm a streamer here.
[12:37.96]I love this.
[12:38.52]This is a great platform to exist.
[12:40.60]And, you know, it's everything, and it's also nothing.
[12:43.56]Twitch.
[12:44.96]Hang out for a while.
[12:46.68]That's alright.
[12:47.08]I just did that.
[12:47.58]I'm fine.
[12:48.12]I literally am absolved from all crimes at this point.
[12:56.44]Yeah, I did.
[12:56.78]I'm good.
[12:58.16]Anyways, alright, let's get started.
[12:58.99]We're going to play Stardew Valley OST.
[13:00.41]We're going to go over...
[13:02.93]Community content art.
[13:03.71]So why don't we do that?
[13:07.05]Ah, listen to that.
[13:09.37]Isn't it beautiful?
[13:18.02]Ah.
[13:20.08]Let's get it on screen.
[13:21.08]I'm going to just start with the artwork first.
[13:24.35]Because, you know, that's what we've been doing.
[13:26.03]This is the third time we've done it.
[13:29.05]Oh, and hi.
[13:30.53]I'm in the wrong position, aren't I?
[13:36.84]This is probably not the best music for the image that's on the screen right now.
[13:42.98]Is that guy naked?
[13:43.80]Alright, that was a good one.
[13:50.62]Oh, Stardew Valley.
[13:51.74]Here's Saturn eating his children.
[13:55.20]Okay.
[13:57.62]What do we bottom right?
[14:03.28]What?
[14:05.26]What?
[14:07.40]You just freaked me the fuck out.
[14:08.70]I thought there was something on this image that I didn't see.
[14:12.35]Don't shout this person out.
[14:14.41]Why?
[14:14.67]I mean, it's down in the corner.
[14:16.71]Alright, coming up, this is another Doodles from CoreMonster.
[14:21.05]Please, if you submit art or anything, get your shit on the bottom.
[14:26.22]You know what I mean?
[14:27.12]So we can know.
[14:28.18]So it's not just me sitting in a chair.
[14:33.50]Taking what you've created and going, yeah, that's good, me.
[14:38.14]Nice.
[14:39.90]Hey, we succeeded on the... Typeframe.
[14:50.25]Alright, I'm okay.
[14:52.95]Thanks for the 238 subs and the 7,200 and fucking... Like $100 in bits.
[14:56.29]Jesus Christ.
[14:57.13]Here come the emotes.
[15:04.86]Free Skype account.
[15:06.30]Anyways, this is cool.
[15:08.04]This looks like some doodles, which are always cute and interesting.
[15:13.22]It's literally $700.
[15:14.02]I know.
[15:19.09]It's a lot of money.
[15:22.55]I just want... I know.
[15:23.57]It's a lot.
[15:27.35]It's plans, though, for that money.
[15:30.67]Going directly in a circle.
[15:33.99]And it is just wandering.
[15:35.71]Because I'm just going to put it back into the Twitch stream.
[15:39.36]Oh, it is going to Twitch.
[15:43.44]Right?
[15:44.20]So if I get $100 and I put like $80 back into the stream.
[15:48.04]Fuck.
[15:51.93]Fuck!
[15:54.49]Here's another one from CoreMonster.
[15:59.41]Stocks are in a tumble.
[16:02.27]This is the number one beer?
[16:03.66]This is supposed to be the first beer?
[16:08.14]Oh wait, no, that's Bugleberry.
[16:09.52]Is it Bugleberry?
[16:12.80]Oh, is that Bugleberry's urns?
[16:14.14]I don't even know my own lore.
[16:21.68]Beerberry.
[16:23.99]Bullshit.
[16:26.01]I wish I could do even 5% of this, by the way.
[16:29.15]If I could even do 10% of just doodles like this,
[16:37.71]I would have drawn the, like, tiger-eating-the-guy dream.
[16:40.58]You know what I mean?
[16:41.76]I would draw so much shit.
[16:44.88]There's just so many random creatures and monsters up here that I would be drawing.
[16:50.00]I wish I could.
[16:51.45]No, I can't.
[16:52.15]I cannot learn.
[16:52.89]I cannot learn.
[16:53.65]It's no one.
[16:54.17]No, I cannot.
[16:55.41]No, I cannot.
[16:55.85]I went to school for this.
[16:57.37]I paid money to an institution to learn how to do this.
[17:00.71]And I'm not teachable.
[17:09.84]I learned... I'm just too... I hold a pen... I hold a pencil like this, guys.
[17:18.89]I can't learn how to draw.
[17:20.31]I can't do it.
[17:23.85]And I know my limitations.
[17:26.05]And my limitations are... Okay, here we are.
[17:28.95]This is what I'm incapable of as a person.
[17:33.24]Funny voices.
[17:34.02]Noises.
[17:36.98]That's it.
[17:37.30]That's all I'm gonna do.
[17:40.19]You know, we've got, like, noises.
[17:43.23]For instance, like, you've probably never heard anybody be able to go like this before.
[17:47.38]Like, who can do that that you know?
[17:50.38]How about this one?
[17:51.44]How about that?
[18:01.55]I never get embarrassed on stream, but that just did it for me.
[18:05.89]I don't know why, because I saw the, I can see the preview over here.
[18:09.19]You guys, see the chat is right here.
[18:13.48]Right there, you guys are right there.
[18:16.18]On this monitor.
[18:17.28]And then my webcam and my preview is right there.
[18:23.30]So I look over at what you guys are saying and then I, who's that fucking weirdo?
[18:27.44]You know what I mean?
[18:27.86]Like, for instance, I'm looking at you guys right now.
[18:30.76]Who's this guy?
[18:32.04]And I fucking don't like him.
[18:33.60]I can't put... This is why I don't do webcam.
[18:36.26]Like, I'm too distractible.
[18:38.08]I'm distracted by my own face.
[18:40.04]This is what happens to me in the mirror.
[18:42.54]I'm not kidding.
[18:43.24]When I get out of the shower, I'm just like... I'm like one of those fishes that if they see themselves in a mirror, they get, like, angry.
[18:55.15]What is it called?
[19:00.84]A beta.
[19:11.23]You know if like your cat sees itself in the mirror and it's just like... Like that's what I do every day.
[19:31.77]okay I'm like an animal that sees another like animal in the mirror and thinks it's another animal but it's just me I just greased I greased up god damn it man
[19:52.57]I told you I'm not lying!
[19:54.13]I told you guys didn't think I was mad at a sludge.
[19:56.71]You guys didn't think I was mad at a fucking sludge.
[19:59.08]Nobody believes me!
[20:00.42]Nobody believes me!
[20:01.10]Do you believe me now?
[20:03.10]Do you believe me now?
[20:08.58]You believe me now, huh?
[20:11.04]What's he talking about?
[20:11.82]He said like he keeps slipping his finger off the A button when he's playing this game.
[20:16.58]Oh, I just touched this and slimed you guys.
[20:25.96]community content where we celebrate all the wonderful things that people in this community create.
[20:32.26]We're talking about you.
[20:35.10]We're not talking about Jeremy being a cat or fish or a dog that sees itself in the mirror and thinks it's another dog and freaks out.
[20:51.12]Very good work, Core Monster.
[20:52.30]Very good stuff.
[20:55.17]These are a couple of thumbnails.
[21:03.65]From the second channel.
[21:04.69]Might as well show them.
[21:05.27]They're fantastic.
[21:07.45]I think these are all by the same artist, by the way.
[21:13.82]I love this.
[21:14.34]This image is fucking fantastic.
[21:18.36]I think this is actually from the game itself, apparently.
[21:24.97]That's so good.
[21:25.71]I know it is.
[21:26.33]It's so good.
[21:32.17]God, don't you like wish you were Spider-Man sometimes?
[21:34.33]I love how just done... I love how just done with me Spider-Man is in these images.
[21:51.14]This is like what it's like when you live in a city and somebody comes to visit.
[21:57.90]And you take them around for a tour.
[22:06.53]And this may have been like the 500th person that has done this.
[22:11.69]And they're like, holy shit!
[22:12.91]And you're like, yeah!
[22:14.63]Pipe train!
[22:15.61]This shit is real.
[22:20.38]This is everything.
[22:22.90]It's all connected.
[22:25.38]All connected.
[22:27.40]We need variety.
[22:28.42]We need different things to happen.
[22:32.20]Me too.
[22:34.09]I'm talking about like the same thing happens.
[22:36.91]Those of you that weren't here, I'm talking about the Han Solo wires in the ride at Disneyland.
[22:42.99]Some of you might not remember this and maybe you weren't here, but I can't even explain it.
[22:48.85]Anybody get anything I'm saying?
[22:50.19]I gotta be very clear.
[22:50.97]Does anybody get this?
[22:53.85]I mean, even like three people.
[22:55.87]Does anybody get this?
[22:58.21]Nobody remembers this?
[23:01.15]This is, like, the same thing as the Han Solo ride 50 times in a row.
[23:04.89]Because, I mean, I need to, like, review this VOD and, like, bring it to the doctor.
[23:19.36]Hey.
[23:20.34]Oh, yeah.
[23:21.31]I got my physical coming up.
[23:23.73]Doc, what do you think about this?
[23:24.95]Can you just, like, go over this footage for a little while with me?
[23:28.62]Can you just watch this bot and then, like, help me here?
[23:33.80]This is a dream you had.
[23:34.94]This is from VR.
[23:46.21]This is multi-trip.
[23:47.19]Nice work.
[23:51.87]I have this... Yeah, this is the acid sludge.
[23:57.60]My body's just made out of it.
[24:00.58]Isn't there a superhero or a supervillain or something that has, like, acid-like ability?
[24:04.62]Probably me.
[24:08.23]Remember, this manga sucks.
[24:12.33]This is a fantastic image.
[24:16.45]How dare you say something so ridiculous?
[24:18.39]This is fucking awesome.
[24:21.01]Oh, you're referring to the story.
[24:22.27]The story.
[24:23.41]Oh.
[24:24.90]Oh.
[24:28.74]I get it.
[24:30.82]This is great work, though.
[24:33.57]Here are some doodles of the Rat Movie characters.
[24:37.07]Getting a little closer, actually, so you can see it better.
[24:40.87]We've got... The thing about this game, I don't know who these characters are in the game.
[24:45.41]Like, their actual names.
[24:47.58]Actually, the characters in 3D Movie Maker have real names.
[24:50.80]And they're wild.
[24:56.38]I used to know them all.
[24:58.99]Like Dick Dastardly Richard, his name in the game is not that.
[25:02.15]It's like Gregory.
[25:06.15]We need that lore.
[25:10.43]Well, his name is Dick Dastardly Richard.
[25:11.83]Well, it's been amended, sure.
[25:16.83]No, no, no, I'm saying in the lore, this character's name is not Gregory.
[25:22.16]His name is Richard.
[25:27.04]The actor's name, yes.
[25:31.56]I like, uh, I like this one.
[25:33.94]I like this one.
[25:36.54]I love the super expressive artwork that people do.
[25:40.70]Although, would it be credited as Gregory?
[25:49.29]I like cartoon, almost Looney Tunes style of over-expression and stuff.
[25:53.73]I love it.
[25:55.91]I just, I wish I was capable of it.
[25:57.31]That was a rumor, yeah.
[26:02.42]Let's zoom back out.
[26:04.34]Here are some more doodles.
[26:13.90]Is that mustache hair?
[26:21.33]I can't help it.
[26:22.03]This is just how I look.
[26:23.77]You know what I mean?
[26:26.79]Like... If you tell me to smile for a camera...
[26:32.36]Like, I just have, like, a goblin face.
[26:34.14]Like, I can't help it.
[26:34.94]I can't help that.
[26:37.26]I've tried.
[26:37.80]Because I can't smile.
[26:39.62]Smiling normally for me is just, like, I can't, I just, I can't do it.
[26:46.83]Like, in a picture, me going, like, no, I can't do it.
[26:51.81]I feel, like, too fucked up trying to do it.
[26:54.23]Like, no, I can't.
[26:56.65]I feel like I'm just, I'm pretending.
[27:00.87]So I always just do this in a picture.
[27:02.31]I always just go like... Which, that's fine.
[27:08.84]I can't do a big, wide, animated, like, smile, because I just feel like, because every time the picture's taken, like, for instance, like, take it.
[27:17.14]Take the picture.
[27:17.84]Like... Like, I'm the fucking psycho in that image.
[27:28.49]That's not a good look.
[27:34.89]reaction gift.
[27:40.26]Yeah, look, I'm doing it now, like that.
[27:45.44]Cartoon Villanova.
[27:46.24]This is great though, I like this.
[27:47.82]I like the, uh, you got a lot of the, you got a lot of the nuances here.
[27:53.16]This over here, this over here.
[27:54.42]Very good.
[27:57.48]But do we already have it?
[27:58.22]Hold on, do you already got it?
[28:04.39]Right, okay, so hear me out on this.
[28:08.83]So this image... This image... is... That's how I look in pictures.
[28:29.19]Like, that's the type of image where, like, you're on, like, vacation somewhere.
[28:34.64]And the person's taking the photo.
[28:36.24]There's, like, three or four of you in this photo.
[28:38.56]I'm one of them.
[28:39.54]And that's the face you make while deep in the distance you're smiling and, like, the volcano back there is erupting.
[28:47.77]And that's the in-between from I'm smiling and happy to...
[28:52.84]there's a disaster over there and it's boom right there right at that moment I'm like that in every photo ask Kim when we go out and we're like oh let's take a let's take like a selfie together Kim will take a photo and it's just like she's like no no not that one let's do it again and I'm like okay
[29:21.01]No, no, no, that one's... No, no, no, you can't.
[29:23.91]And then I'm like, alright, let me do it, let me do it.
[29:26.33]And I take the photo, and I take the camera, and I'm like... I try to get it in the right spot for me to take the photo, because I know when I'm going to press the button, right?
[29:34.83]And then I just end up doing this.
[29:39.88]That's real life.
[29:41.30]Go to every picture I've ever been in.
[29:44.86]That face, every time.
[29:53.46]Just telling you facts here.
[29:55.00]I put it all on the table.
[29:56.48]What do I care?
[30:03.17]Irma bloat?
[30:04.81]Alright, let's get back to community content night.
[30:06.63]For God's sake.
[30:09.19]What an egomaniac.
[30:14.33]Egomaniac is like airing out his insecurities?
[30:17.48]Isn't that like the opposite of an egomaniac?
[30:22.03]Oh, what an egomaniac.
[30:23.11]He's like telling us about his insecurities.
[30:26.32]And he's showing us his real side.
[30:30.96]It is?
[30:31.98]Is it?
[30:32.22]Hold on, if I tell you, hey, I don't like the way that I look in photos.
[30:37.56]I do the same thing in photos.
[30:38.68]I look strange.
[30:41.60]Wouldn't an egomaniac be like, I look good in every fucking picture.
[30:46.32]I am so handsome.
[30:48.25]I'm the most handsome person that you've ever met.
[30:51.26]Isn't that what egomania is?
[30:55.68]You're talking about yourself.
[31:17.65]We've seen this.
[31:18.43]We saw this before.
[31:19.33]It snuck into the last one.
[31:31.15]Look at that big brain up there.
[31:32.57]Look at this huge brain that's up there.
[31:44.03]So bad.
[31:44.75]So bad.
[31:46.48]Idiot.
[31:47.16]Bald.
[31:47.62]Oh my god.
[31:49.46]Malding.
[31:50.06]Sour please.
[31:50.92]Old.
[31:51.18]A YouTube link.
[31:55.56]Now that's completely accurate.
[31:58.24]It's just a YouTube link.
[32:01.56]follow me LOL what's going on this is fantastic this is my snoozing copter what's going on in this stream idiot bald bald
[32:23.18]No, this is good shit.
[32:24.14]I love this.
[32:24.52]You even got this.
[32:25.88]I mean, typically the camera would be this way.
[32:30.17]But... You even got the foam.
[32:32.31]Good work.
[32:37.19]Let's get going.
[32:39.25]Oh, I just... I sort of flipped this, but just go like this.
[32:43.82]But actually, I can do it right now.
[32:45.06]Ready?
[32:45.24]Okay.
[32:53.14]That's too much.
[32:57.57]Not quite.
[32:57.99]Wrong.
[32:59.05]Can you tell I'm new at this?
[33:24.15]I don't, I fucked it up.
[33:27.21]It's good.
[33:27.61]Actually, I actually like it like this.
[33:30.01]I think it's better like this because the wine is pouring upside down.
[33:34.21]The wine is now the number one thing that you want to look at in the image.
[33:37.15]You know what I'm saying?
[33:40.39]And then this is like his arm flowing down, his head, I actually like it like this.
[33:45.68]I'm serious.
[33:52.02]The wine actually is the front and center.
[33:57.43]Why are you drinking wine out of a beer glass?
[34:02.98]This is completely judgment-free zone here.
[34:06.00]Because... I don't... I drink whatever I want to drink out of any cup that I can get.
[34:14.74]Well, you have to drink wine out of a wine glass.
[34:18.45]Why?
[34:19.11]Why can't I drink wine out of a Pac-Man cup?
[34:21.91]Who cares?
[34:22.41]It's just a cup.
[34:26.50]It just holds the thing that you then put in your stomach.
[34:30.24]Who cares?
[34:30.74]Because.
[34:35.06]Because why?
[34:35.58]So you guys can look good in a picture?
[34:40.16]I don't care about that shit.
[34:43.92]You know?
[34:44.54]I don't fucking care.
[34:45.24]This is great though.
[34:51.97]Seriously, thank you.
[34:54.55]From the carnival.
[35:02.67]I got a good Clint Eastwood face going here.
[35:05.03]This is the Wailord.
[35:09.71]Wailord is currently downstairs.
[35:12.63]Wailord has become another bed for Otto to sleep on.
[35:19.64]Otto has been climbing on top of it and just laying on it and getting comfortable on it.
[35:25.34]Wailord is now Otto bed number three.
[35:28.18]Or four.
[35:36.78]Get a picture of that?
[35:37.52]Okay.
[35:40.52]I'll tell Kim the next time that she sees him doing it.
[35:43.82]Here's the thing, my camera sucks.
[35:46.48]I hate taking photos with my iPhone because the camera looks like somebody spit on the lens.
[35:53.16]Get a real phone.
[35:56.78]I want, no, I'm waiting until somebody releases a small phone.
[36:03.28]I want the SE.
[36:05.32]But Apple decided that they were going to just kill the SE, not sell it anymore.
[36:11.00]And make every phone three times bigger.
[36:14.10]I don't want a big phone.
[36:15.56]I want a small, very easy to hold, thin, small phone.
[36:22.38]I don't want huge phones.
[36:24.06]I just looked over here and got scared.
[36:27.23]It just freaked me the fuck out for a second.
[36:35.58]Like, here.
[36:36.52]Like this.
[36:37.92]Like, this is on the other monitor right now.
[36:44.18]Get that off.
[36:47.76]Uh, I want a small phone.
[36:49.70]Carnival was one of the most fun times I ever had on stream, and I loved it.
[36:53.48]And I'm happy that people thought it was fun.
[36:55.99]There's another image.
[36:56.89]Well, we're doing community content tonight.
[37:02.87]Jerma OF THE FUTURE!
[37:09.15]Jerma of the past is probably more accurate.
[37:15.78]Jerma of the past.
[37:21.32]Gotta be young again.
[37:23.50]Jerma of the future.
[37:24.32]Jerma of the future is gonna be walking around with a cane.
[37:29.64]Just like... I'm gonna be leaned over, hunched over.
[37:36.77]Make this Jerm out of the... Erase that and make a Jerm of the past.
[37:41.25]Time to get swole again.
[37:42.31]I don't think I could ever do it again.
[37:47.21]And look at this shirt.
[37:47.99]I used to wear those tank tops.
[37:49.83]I still do.
[37:56.07]Gym stream.
[37:58.33]No, I understand now why you drive by all those old people, old ladies and old men that are just going like this when they walk down the street.
[38:07.76]They just go for a walk and you're like, what are they doing on there?
[38:09.64]And they're just going like this.
[38:13.88]I never understood why they were doing this.
[38:15.40]I didn't get it.
[38:17.94]Like, why are you doing that?
[38:19.12]They're just moving around.
[38:20.82]They're just getting their arms and their muscles and their blood flowing and then they go home.
[38:24.64]That's what I'm going to do.
[38:26.90]I aspire to be that now.
[38:35.22]Gru Gru in public.
[38:40.74]No, that's... What?
[38:44.70]Oh, okay.
[38:45.26]I get it.
[38:45.72]I get it.
[38:46.04]That's fucking ridiculous.
[38:47.07]Alright, but this is good.
[38:47.81]Thank you.
[38:48.81]It's good shit.
[38:49.53]That's how I used to look.
[38:50.37]Man, I was... Riding Cheesy.
[38:59.99]Riding Cheesy from Ike.
[39:01.55]Thank you, Ike.
[39:04.50]I like the nose.
[39:09.74]Very cute.
[39:11.70]Fried and cheesy.
[39:14.80]No helmet.
[39:19.77]Well, we don't know that he's operating the vehicle.
[39:23.41]He could be sitting still.
[39:24.33]He could be at a parking lot.
[39:28.11]We don't know that this is being operated.
[39:34.45]By the way, it's not real.
[39:36.05]This is not really happening.
[39:38.17]Wait, somebody get a helmet on him!
[39:40.29]This is an image of a cartoon character.
[39:44.15]What?
[39:55.80]Uh, this is actually pretty interesting, considering you go, oh, is that just the giant rat?
[40:01.66]Well, it is.
[40:03.33]But from the post, this person has imported the giant rat into Source Filmmaker.
[40:10.69]Uh, and I have the link for that right here.
[40:16.15]This apparently is the Source Filmmaker files for the, that giant rat.
[40:22.24]I don't know how you, I don't even know how that was even possible.
[40:29.18]So, I wonder how you did that.
[40:32.34]You must have had to just model it, right?
[40:33.86]And then import it in.
[40:37.02]Rat Movie 3 in Source Filmmaker.
[40:43.59]I just ripped the model and imported it into Blender and ported it.
[40:46.73]That's fucking cool.
[40:50.55]That's awesome.
[40:52.00]I didn't even know that- I thought they were made out of, like, bitmap images.
[40:54.94]I didn't even know it was real 3D.
[40:56.99]I thought it was just, like, fake 3D or something.
[40:58.79]That's... I guess it would kind of have to be, right?
[41:02.27]I thought it was just, like, bitmapped.
[41:08.44]Fake 3D.
[41:09.32]Yeah, like, remember, like, Mario RPG?
[41:10.88]That wasn't real 3D.
[41:11.54]It was just fake 3D.
[41:12.96]It was... Sprites.
[41:15.44]Yeah.
[41:17.36]Yeah, like a sprite image or something.
[41:20.70]Well, like polygons.
[41:21.98]I didn't know they actually had modeled polygons or something.
[41:26.42]I don't know.
[41:27.14]2.5D.
[41:27.83]Isometric view.
[41:29.61]Like Mario 64.
[41:30.95]I guess Mario 64 is 3D.
[41:34.83]I understand you, Jeremy.
[41:37.27]Okay, good.
[41:42.38]All 3D is polygon.
[41:44.36]Yeah.
[41:45.96]Yeah, that's true.
[41:49.56]5G Jerma.
[41:51.36]I'm making a new emote.
[41:53.64]It's gonna be Jerma 5G.
[41:57.32]And it's gonna be that image that I just took of me smiling.
[42:02.73]With, um, like, scan lines on it.
[42:09.75]You know, like... Huh?
[42:13.31]I don't fucking know what's going on.
[42:14.79]I think this is useless for it.
[42:17.92]That's really awesome, though.
[42:22.99]I know it's the same exact face, because that's what I know.
[42:28.04]Screenshot that one.
[42:31.82]Alright, coming up next we have... Oh, this is big.
[42:34.86]This is a big boy here.
[42:37.36]Uh, Jerma985GumballEyes, $4.20.
[42:42.97]I think we've seen this image before, but not on a community content night, so... I love that emote so much.
[43:01.09]It just conveys so many different emotions for me.
[43:04.57]It really does.
[43:05.09]I love it.
[43:09.15]Worst emote.
[43:09.85]No, worst emote is jermaTV.
[43:11.91]And weirdly enough, I don't want to delete jermaTV because it's... It's just... I don't... You can't delete an emote.
[43:21.68]You know what I'm saying?
[43:22.68]Otherwise people... Somebody will be very, very, very mad about that.
[43:29.19]If you delete an emote, there'll be somebody.
[43:31.21]I'll get a letter.
[43:32.39]And it'll be like, Jerma, why did you delete jermaTV?
[43:37.01]There was a jermaTV community where we did that.
[43:40.93]And we used it.
[43:41.71]And I'm going to be like, fuck.
[43:47.63]And then I'm going to have to put it back.
[43:49.45]You can never delete something.
[43:50.77]You can only add stuff.
[43:52.24]Especially considering, well, jermaBld's coin is going to get deleted.
[43:59.22]And this space is going to get deleted too, because there already is one here.
[44:03.36]There's two of those, so that's getting deleted.
[44:07.96]But you can't... I just don't want to delete that many emotes.
[44:10.33]I deleted next.
[44:11.47]Yeah, I deleted next because it turned into one of the most spammable things ever.
[44:17.21]And you could... People were just saying next on every single thing that was on the screen.
[44:25.38]I would look over and it doesn't matter what it was.
[44:27.28]It was just like, next, next, next.
[44:30.02]It took over the entire chat.
[44:31.72]So I was like, I got it.
[44:32.54]I have to get rid of this.
[44:33.40]What a mistake this was for me to add this.
[44:34.66]I have to get rid of this.
[44:41.20]Those are the old times.
[44:44.70]Some old things need to go away.
[44:46.38]You know what I'm saying?
[44:48.31]Like, Jerma next.
[44:50.97]It was only around for like two months.
[44:52.41]It wasn't like it's been here for like five years.
[44:55.15]It was here for like two months tops.
[44:58.33]And then I was like, I can't do it anymore.
[45:03.04]That's true.
[45:03.52]I know, I know, I know.
[45:14.55]Here's another doodle with Shito.
[45:21.84]I'm not even, what is this?
[45:23.80]Is this a cigar?
[45:24.56]I thought I'm drinking coffee.
[45:33.55]Am I drinking coffee through the cigar?
[45:37.59]Is that what we're supposed to be implied?
[45:39.85]No.
[45:40.69]It's just, it's just here.
[45:44.61]Imagine you had a chin that fucking big.
[45:52.89]I feel like it would be a problem.
[45:56.50]How many of you guys lie in bed like this?
[45:58.44]Like, even if my chin was like a... I've got a big chin.
[46:00.88]I do.
[46:01.46]I have a very large chin area.
[46:04.82]Like, frontal chin.
[46:06.10]If this was even another half an inch down, like this, an inch down, when I lie down in bed, and I hold, like, I'm on my phone, or I have, like, my iPad, or I'm just lying there, you know, you go like this.
[46:17.93]You would be... You'd make a mark here.
[46:21.68]You know what I mean?
[46:22.24]Like, it would just... If you had, like, big, huge chin, you'd be pressing it down, like, into your neck.
[46:26.58]You would just, like, hit your trachea.
[46:29.00]And you'd be like... You couldn't put your neck down.
[46:34.40]Aw.
[46:40.66]Anyways, this is good.
[46:41.68]This is my first time drawing Jerma.
[46:43.72]Oh, it looks great.
[46:47.14]What did you do this with?
[46:47.88]Uh... Oh, sit down.
[46:51.02]You're here.
[46:54.07]This doesn't look like a mark.
[46:55.33]This looks like, um, like, almost like crayon or wax or something.
[47:05.00]It looks cool.
[47:06.78]It's digital?
[47:07.20]Well, if it's digital, it's supposed to be mimicking something.
[47:11.20]But, like, it looks kind of like wax, like crayon.
[47:14.15]It's called a brush in Photoshop.
[47:16.77]Yeah, I know.
[47:17.47]I know.
[47:18.05]I know.
[47:19.61]I'm saying, like, it's waxy.
[47:23.64]Look.
[47:23.84]See what I'm saying?
[47:26.83]It's texture.
[47:27.45]Yeah, like a crayon.
[47:30.73]Like you.
[47:31.19]What is your fucking world?
[47:43.50]Banned.
[47:57.44]What is... Oh, these are the animals from The Sims.
[48:00.93]This is The Sims.
[48:01.77]For a second, I was like, is this the right streamer?
[48:03.87]Is this, like, a different person?
[48:05.51]Okay, it's the drug dealer from The Sims.
[48:07.89]Okay.
[48:13.53]Buy drugs.
[48:14.27]Please buy drugs from me.
[48:33.20]Flip and report him.
[48:35.36]Oh, get out of here.
[48:39.18]This is, uh, at the very least, 7-4 confirmed.
[48:45.46]We're, if we're being honest.
[48:49.28]Alright, so that, yeah, so 7-4.
[48:51.94]That makes me, I'm told.
[49:01.50]Let's just say that's a full foot, right?
[49:03.20]Let's say this is a full foot shorter, right?
[49:07.54]That's like 6'4", 6'3".
[49:08.56]What does it say?
[49:16.05]By the way, where to pop this shirt, LOL.
[49:18.87]Asking for a friend.
[49:20.75]I got that Nightwing shirt at a clearance section.
[49:25.08]I don't remember the store.
[49:29.26]It was a clearance section.
[49:31.46]It was just like, these are things that are on sale.
[49:33.16]Hey, it was from some comic book store.
[49:34.98]I don't remember what it was.
[49:35.78]I don't want to give you false info.
[49:42.96]It wasn't Walmart.
[49:45.06]You think Walmart does not have Nightwing shirts?
[49:52.23]I could do it.
[50:06.72]Same universe as Nightwing.
[50:10.88]Yes, they are in the same universe.
[50:15.34]It's a clown car, I believe.
[50:18.40]Looking good.
[50:21.34]Ah, I got something to tell you guys.
[50:26.38]How does Mike... Oh, these are doodles.
[50:28.30]Okay, and there you go.
[50:31.20]I'm never getting rid of that shirt.
[50:32.30]I hope nothing bad happens to that shirt, really.
[50:34.94]You know, sometimes you go into the wash, and you take clothes out, and one of your shirts is just, like, torn up for some reason, and you're just like, oh, what the fuck?
[50:42.10]I really hope that doesn't happen to the Nightwing shirt.
[50:47.49]It's gonna get caught somewhere and get torn or something.
[50:52.43]I'm gonna, now, fuck it, I'm gonna start hand-washing that shirt.
[50:59.03]I'm hand washing that stuff.
[51:00.91]I'm not gonna put it in the washing machine.
[51:05.73]I'm scared.
[51:11.40]Go down here to the rat.
[51:13.60]Michael smells!
[51:15.24]There you are.
[51:15.74]Look, I even zoomed in on it.
[51:16.74]Everybody loves Shito.
[51:23.64]Shito hasn't made an appearance on stream in like six months.
[51:29.24]He's on vacation.
[51:31.32]No, he's on vacation.
[51:32.22]I'll come back soon.
[51:33.20]He's on a long vacation.
[51:35.08]He's on a very, very long vacation.
[51:40.64]And I realize that's what you say to children when somebody potentially dies.
[51:53.71]But Shito is doing just fine.
[51:59.18]fish dies where's where's Mr. guppy oh oh little timmy he's he's just on a long vacation oh because you know that that kid's gonna forget everything about that fish in like two months but that's not the case
[52:28.09]You went on vacation.
[52:31.73]Huge money came in.
[52:34.25]Huge money.
[52:37.41]Mick Tavishes gave 10,000 bits.
[52:40.95]Thank you, Mick Tavishes.
[52:41.81]10,000 bits.
[52:44.75]Jerma, I swore a long time ago that I'd give you big bits once I got a full-time gig.
[52:48.53]I did.
[52:49.01]So here's big bits.
[52:52.41]Thank you.
[52:54.04]Those are very big.
[52:55.26]Those are enormous bits.
[52:57.32]Those are... That's a hundred fucking dollars worth of bits.
[52:59.44]That's a lot of money.
[53:01.52]Thank you.
[53:02.64]For the ridiculous bit drop.
[53:05.94]Glad to hear you got a full-time gig.
[53:09.00]Hope it pays well.
[53:12.74]Did you eat Cheeto?
[53:14.18]Is he inside of you?
[53:15.44]Why did I read that one?
[53:18.51]Excuse me.
[53:29.09]I like this kind of neon look.
[53:38.30]I like this down here.
[53:38.92]Is this a JoJo reference?
[53:43.02]It probably is.
[53:46.24]Yeah, it is.
[53:46.74]Alright.
[53:51.18]I've never even seen JoJo, but I feel like I know the first five episodes already.
[53:57.40]Looks very good, though.
[53:59.73]I do like it.
[54:00.41]Those, like, blended neon edges.
[54:02.47]I went to art school.
[54:04.29]Failed, but I did.
[54:05.33]It's Mr. Sneak Man!
[54:06.43]Look at this neck.
[54:29.97]we got this we got the same neck I'm not looking you yeah I look at some I told you I don't care something you have to at some point you have to accept that you have a turkey neck okay or like a turtle
[54:51.86]I remember a couple of years ago when I still was like, oh, I don't like that.
[54:56.22]I looked up, and this is real.
[54:58.26]I looked up like, how to get rid of the weird turtle lines on your neck.
[55:05.85]I looked it up.
[55:09.13]It turns out you can't, you kind of can't.
[55:18.82]I started moisturizing down here.
[55:21.84]This is fine.
[55:22.78]This is going to be fine for a very long time.
[55:24.94]This is going to be just fine.
[55:26.92]This, however, is not going to be fine over the next 10 years.
[55:30.08]I'm going to be one of those people.
[55:33.65]I'm just going to wear turtlenecks.
[55:36.25]I'm going to be like at the beach in a turtleneck.
[55:39.17]People are going to be like, oh, wow, how old are you?
[55:41.21]You look really, really young.
[55:42.50]Yeah, I am.
[55:46.66]I'm 41.
[55:47.52]It's like, wow, your voice fucking sounds old for that.
[55:51.18]Yeah, I'm 41.
[55:52.50]And my face is going to look fucking perfect like this.
[55:55.38]And then I'm going to take my shirt off at the beach.
[55:59.10]And it's going to be just like dusty and wrinkled and decrepit.
[56:02.69]And everyone's going to be like, holy shit, I thought that guy was like 40.
[56:05.27]He's like 70.
[56:12.31]I'm going to have like a young face at like 60.
[56:21.35]You're a lich.
[56:25.25]Ego, perfect face.
[56:27.75]You- We all have perfect faces!
[56:31.26]In the eyes of the Lord.
[56:35.36]Come on.
[56:44.91]Oh, this is- Oh, wait, wait.
[56:50.25]This one's a little more abstract.
[56:53.83]Who is this person?
[56:59.06]Who is this person?
[56:59.70]No, no, no.
[57:02.92]Like, who is this imitating?
[57:04.88]This, like, this thing.
[57:06.44]Who is this?
[57:07.38]What character is this?
[57:10.35]The character's name is Killer Queen.
[57:13.33]Okay.
[57:16.08]I gotta look this up eventually.
[57:17.30]I'm gonna go to the Killer Queen JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Wikipedia profile fan page and just read.
[57:33.03]I like this though.
[57:37.61]I'm a little more jacked in this one than I am in this one.
[57:43.36]I like how Bob got a nice buff look to me.
[57:49.25]Watch JoJo.
[57:51.45]No, I can't.
[57:52.59]It's too many people have told me to do that.
[57:55.05]Alright, you know when enough people tell you to do something, and they preface this always by going, Hey, you would really love JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[58:03.76]But skip the first two seasons, though.
[58:07.37]What?
[58:08.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[58:08.93]Just don't watch the first, like, three seasons.
[58:10.97]Watch season four and season seven.
[58:13.65]And then season six.
[58:15.67]Halfway through season six.
[58:17.43]Don't watch the first two seasons ever.
[58:22.39]Why?
[58:24.56]Don't skip.
[58:24.96]What the fuck?
[58:25.40]Don't skip.
[58:25.78]What the fuck?
[58:26.86]Nobody says that.
[58:28.18]How many times?
[58:28.68]Hold on.
[58:29.58]We're gonna go over this.
[58:32.45]People, I have heard not to watch the first season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure because it's like fucking different.
[58:37.59]It's not the same.
[58:38.59]People didn't like it.
[58:39.65]First season sucks.
[58:40.57]Don't skip it.
[58:47.14]Those are fake fans.
[58:48.42]Wrong.
[58:52.97]Can you see my eyes?
[58:54.87]Fucking scrolling through this- this- look at- I'm like- I can't re- like- I feel like I'm reading a reverse teleprompter.
[59:02.40]And they have it at x10 speed.
[59:03.24]Okay.
[59:03.54]Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright.
[59:10.42]I'll watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[59:11.87]That's my fucking- Alright.
[59:12.77]You know what?
[59:13.33]Fuck it.
[59:13.83]Listen to this.
[59:14.35]Listen to me.
[59:14.91]I'm gonna look you directly in the eye for this one.
[59:16.69]I am allowed one anime per year.
[59:19.39]It's 2020.
[59:22.15]And it's not going to be JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[59:25.21]It's going to be back on Titan Season 4.
[59:29.67]Oh, I like this.
[59:42.22]This is good.
[59:56.72]This is a great image.
[60:00.10]It really is.
[60:00.68]There's Halloween Mask Jerma.
[60:12.61]This is a great image for... I don't know if it works in an emote.
[60:17.51]But... This is like backseat gaming.
[60:21.99]This is backseat gaming THE image.
[60:32.36]I fucking know everything.
[60:33.78]I know everything about you.
[60:35.08]You're not doing it right.
[60:35.84]Let me help you here.
[60:36.94]Let me help you here.
[60:37.58]You insignificant, tiny, fucking non-person that's ever played the game before.
[60:42.02]I know everything.
[60:49.73]That's good.
[60:50.13]I like it.
[60:52.49]What else we got here?
[60:54.59]You got the stomach.
[60:56.73]Stomach is very accurate.
[61:06.55]Why is the giant rat coming to kill me?
[61:10.06]He's got a knife in his hand.
[61:20.61]What does it say?
[61:29.07]Chat is cute.
[61:37.59]Oh, I don't... Hold on.
[61:38.43]Let me move the camera for a second.
[61:42.02]I want you to see who made this.
[61:46.22]I thought it was about him.
[61:47.56]It could have been.
[61:52.08]Piemations!
[61:59.40]This is fantastic.
[62:00.21]Thank you.
[62:03.39]I love it.
[62:11.77]Alright, this image just makes me happy.
[62:13.07]You know what I mean?
[62:17.41]This is one of those images that you look at and you're just like, I'm happy right now for a minute.
[62:24.47]The oven mitts, what a nice touch, right?
[62:29.69]This is very important.
[62:37.12]Don't we have any nice things, guys?
[62:40.34]Can we have nice things at all?
[62:43.88]Get your mind out of the gutter!
[62:45.28]I... I don't... I mean... I don't know... All I see in this image are a nearly Academy Award winning actor and a top 20 streamer on Twitch.
[63:12.02]I don't, I mean, I don't see anything else in this image that could produce anything negative.
[63:31.95]I don't know what to say.
[63:32.79]I mean, I see like a nearly Academy Award nominated actor.
[63:42.42]And one of the top influencers on the platform.
[63:45.78]I fucking hate that word.
[63:47.64]That word sucks.
[63:51.34]We've gone over that word before.
[63:54.05]The influencer is so stupid.
[63:59.35]It's like they couldn't figure out what to call this group of people.
[64:03.05]Because... Let's be honest.
[64:08.09]It's not like...
[64:09.93]It's not like we're fucking solving, like, world problems.
[64:13.05]You know what I mean?
[64:13.53]It's just like... Oh, what do you do?
[64:21.43]Entertainer?
[64:24.09]Oh.
[64:25.23]Do you, though?
[64:26.29]Are you Adam Sandler?
[64:27.87]And they go, no, no, no, no.
[64:34.29]You influence people to do things.
[64:38.40]That's so fucking creepy though.
[64:43.31]I don't want, I don't want to be like influencing you guys to do something.
[64:46.91]That's weird.
[64:49.85]Hey guys, I just want to make sure you feel very influenced by me today.
[64:55.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[64:57.66]This is going to get like, this might get 20,000 influence points.
[65:02.56]I said something and you clicked on it and you agreed with it and I influenced your opinion and I'm influencing you right now.
[65:08.17]You just don't understand.
[65:08.91]You just don't know.
[65:09.43]No, I prefer Eclan.
[65:16.39]I way prefer that.
[65:18.86]Because influencer makes it sound like I'm supposed to be selling a product right now.
[65:26.87]E-clown.
[65:27.39]Way better.
[65:34.34]You are selling a product.
[65:35.34]You're selling... Hey, BRBs.
[65:41.98]Buying a Nightwing t-shirt.
[65:44.70]I just wanna dick around on the internet and like have fun and I don't... No, don't call me an influencer.
[65:54.35]Or I'll ban ya.
[65:59.74]Your actions have consequences, Jeremy.
[66:17.41]Wait, what?
[66:18.71]Inside of two Jermas.
[66:20.93]Jerma lied about what?
[66:23.09]Jerma lied about 20... Jerma lied about sour in 24 hours.
[66:29.55]No, I didn't.
[66:35.01]I did that within 24 hours.
[66:36.41]That's horseshit.
[66:37.65]I did that.
[66:38.05]We got another huge bits.
[66:42.69]CoreMonster gave $50 in bits.
[66:44.91]You're my favorite influencer, Jerma.
[66:56.56]Eclon.
[66:59.75]Eclon.
[67:00.35]Corrected.
[67:01.75]Uh, thank you for the 5,000 bits, though.
[67:13.06]You know how bad, somewhere in my brain, I want to get on, like, the Fortune 500 list?
[67:20.19]And I could, it would be Fortune 500 Eclon.
[67:27.30]Can you imagine having to read that as like a guy that owns like 600 fucking real estate properties?
[67:34.79]Oh, let me see where I am.
[67:35.77]Well, I own, what do I own?
[67:37.33]I own fucking, I own Macy's Target.
[67:40.63]And I also, I have 500 corporate offices.
[67:44.48]What's the next page?
[67:46.00]Derma985, the influencer e-clown.
[67:54.45]He just tears it out and fucking rips it and crumples it up and fucking eats it.
[67:58.21]Still an influencer.
[68:02.67]Fuck.
[68:03.41]Whatever.
[68:07.10]What does he do?
[68:07.64]What does he even do?
[68:11.24]Where the hell he is?
[68:12.34]He's at 1.6 billion?
[68:15.86]I'm only in 1.72 billion.
[68:18.80]I can't let this happen.
[68:19.92]I can't let this happen.
[68:21.12]I can't let this fucking e-clown take over my empire.
[68:29.23]Anyways, let's go.
[68:35.22]If anybody needed any more confirmation as to Eclan.
[68:38.00]Alright, this like hurts my head.
[68:49.46]Okay.

[71:06.68]Betty White slot machine.
[71:09.00]What would you guys do if one day I turned on a stream and I didn't introduce anything?
[71:14.99]I was sitting in front of the Betty White slot machine and just played it for like four straight hours.
[71:28.69]And then I turn to the camera when there's no more money left.
[71:33.18]And I just go like,
[71:37.93]Hey, can I bum a 20?
[71:39.27]Hey, can I bum a 20?
[71:47.38]And then a hype train happens.

[72:03.82]Nobody would give anything.
[72:05.98]I know.
[72:06.60]And they shouldn't.

[80:04.39]Alright, why is everybody spamming this?

[80:18.94]Like a big toilet or something.
[80:20.38]What is this?
[80:23.16]It's a toilet bowl.
[80:25.34]That you shade it over?
[80:26.76]I don't get it.

[82:50.80]I don't think I've ever said it before.
[82:53.86]Look at how much bigger I am than these two puny, puny combatants.
[82:59.06]I don't even stand a chance.
[83:02.48]Look, you even need to bring a chair this time.

[83:37.82]This is from that one...
[83:41.03]Big chicken stream that somebody squished my face together and it just looks fucking ridiculous.
[83:48.45]Very modern.
[83:49.75]Very modern.
[83:56.67]God damn it.
[83:59.23]Jerma Warhol.
[84:00.29]Ugh.
[84:14.20]This is impressive if it really is two inches tall.
[84:17.22]That's very detailed for being two inches tall.
[84:21.82]Do you have like one of those big magnifying glasses?
[84:23.66]Like the guys that fix watches?
[84:31.60]That's real life scale.
[84:34.76]Oh, yellow bell, I know.
[84:35.96]Yellow bell, funny.
[84:37.34]Brought into scale.
[84:38.20]Yellow bell, everybody say it.
[84:39.40]Yellow bell, everybody yell it.
[84:42.51]This is really detailed, though.
[84:43.89]It really is.
[84:44.46]Thanks a lot, Gwen.
[84:48.84]Jax Fireman.
[84:52.60]By Mikey Lokey, again.
[84:58.06]I've got a wicked itchy eye.
[85:02.02]Sometimes this happens.
[85:03.74]Where, like, the lining of my eye will just be itchy, itchy, itchy, itchy for not even, like, ten minutes, and then it goes away.
[85:11.42]Like, whoa, it's horrible.
[85:15.71]It's just only one eye, too.
[85:19.78]I want to itch it.
[85:20.26]I know.
[85:20.52]I try not to.
[85:22.66]Oh, God.
[85:23.94]Oh, God.
[85:25.08]What does this mean?
[85:25.52]What does it mean?
[85:27.00]What does this actually mean?
[85:27.84]Anybody know what this means?
[85:34.52]It's just like... Oh, horrible scratch.
[85:36.95]Itchy.
[85:37.31]Horrible.
[85:37.69]This is great work, though.
[85:43.32]Get well soon, Jeremy.
[85:45.12]And this is from Invaders.
[85:48.98]Thank you.
[85:51.72]Doing my best.
[85:53.36]Doing my best.
[85:55.63]Appropriate.
[85:59.11]How do they know about the eye?
[86:00.63]Spliceable Spleen.
[86:01.81]Five community subs.
[86:03.81]Thank you, Spliceable Spleen.
[86:05.72]Look at eye drops.
[86:07.78]Eyedrops are tricky for me because when I put eyedrops in, I know they're coming, and I know it's about to happen, and I just tear up.
[86:15.59]I start crying, and then it hits my eye, and it's like just tears streaming down my face, and it almost makes it worse.
[86:21.30]It's, I can't, it's just weird to me.
[86:29.70]I can't, somebody else, I can't, if somebody else is gonna do it, not possible.
[86:32.93]I have to do it myself.
[86:38.42]Every time I'm outside in the wind, I think it's just really sensitive eyes, because when I go out in the wind, I will get these just tears that just blow back like this until I get inside.
[86:51.62]And then I have this, like, redness from the lines of tears.
[86:57.49]Want to just redeem a wink?
[87:00.41]Yeah, yep.
[87:08.16]Which eye?
[87:09.18]The irritated one?
[87:10.98]You get to pick the eye.
[87:11.74]Which one?
[87:12.12]The irritated eye or the non-irritated eye?
[87:15.28]Which one?
[87:17.71]Irritated?
[87:22.97]Irritated.
[87:23.47]Okay.
[87:34.05]I have to move my mouth when I wink.
[87:35.21]I don't know why.
[87:37.29]You know what I'm saying?
[87:38.11]It's like the muscle that's here is connected to here.
[87:41.59]Is that odd?
[87:43.35]Like... It's normal?
[87:52.10]Okay.
[87:53.54]There you go.
[88:05.48]Excellent work.
[88:07.52]Whoa, this is, uh, this is good.
[88:09.52]This is busy.
[88:10.64]This one's real busy.
[88:12.80]Let's get out of the way for this one.
[88:13.84]Alright, we got the moon.
[88:17.14]We've got Glue Man.
[88:17.98]We've got Cheeto.
[88:18.76]We've got Pac-Man.
[88:21.86]Glue Man, this is me.
[88:24.88]Beanbag Sonic, that's the hot air balloon.
[88:27.18]Nightwing.
[88:27.71]Why is everybody... What's with the Nightwing?
[88:33.27]How many times have I worn that shirt on camera?
[88:39.96]Oh, it's Jax.
[88:40.86]That's right, it's Jax.
[88:42.86]Hundreds, you think?
[88:46.09]Alright, I just had a... You may have seen it in my face, because the camera's on, but I just had, like, an internal... Like, is it on now?
[88:54.45]For a tenth of a second.
[89:05.26]This is fucking scary.
[89:07.52]What is going on here?
[89:10.42]What is this?
[89:12.66]What?
[89:14.18]It's Fireman, but it is like a... There's the rat.
[89:21.75]What is this?
[89:22.21]Is this my room?
[89:25.37]Oh, that's the door.
[89:27.25]Oh, the body sliders.
[89:28.45]Right, right, right, right, right.
[89:29.43]Okay.
[89:30.05]This is crazy.
[89:34.34]This is crazy.
[89:34.86]I love it.
[89:37.04]Any artist name?
[89:37.76]Any artist name on here?
[89:39.42]I don't see it.
[89:41.58]I do not see an artist's name.
[89:44.54]No.
[89:46.56]I don't.
[89:46.98]Thank you, though.
[89:49.54]Garfield down in the corner.
[89:51.01]I didn't acknowledge Garfield.
[89:52.13]I don't know what this is.
[89:55.23]It's a JoJo thing.
[90:23.21]I got a question.
[90:25.27]So I've never seen the show.
[90:31.34]I don't know what this is.
[90:32.12]I don't know what that is.
[90:38.94]What's the proper reaction to have to that image if I've never seen the show?
[90:47.47]Yeah!
[90:48.25]I know those two people!
[90:50.63]That's... For all I know, guys, this is... What the fuck is that?
[90:55.76]Uh, okay.
[91:00.48]For all I know... Wait a minute, I was gonna say that... Oh my god!
[91:03.82]Okay, I was just gonna say, for all I know, this could be Beavis and Butthead.
[91:08.98]And the image that I just showed on stream was a combination of Beavis and Butthead.
[91:24.46]I was gonna say, this could be just Beavis and fucking Butthead and I don't know who they are!
[91:39.73]The ultimate streamer.
[91:41.65]Ask Joel about JoJo.
[91:43.97]No, but what is he gonna say?
[91:45.63]Hey, dude, wait, what about JoJo?
[91:48.37]And he's gonna go, ah, it's a good show, you should watch it.
[91:53.01]Joel, you sure you don't want to show me one of these characters?
[91:55.61]Why don't you show me two of the characters on screen?
[92:04.93]Hey, Joel, what?
[92:06.59]Hey, hey, Joel, what about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?
[92:09.71]And he's like, oh, sure.
[92:11.11]He turns on his webcam and starts doing poses and shit.
[92:15.90]I'll be like, now I get it.
[92:23.38]Now I get it.
[92:27.83]But, uh, long story short, I don't get it.
[92:29.95]Maybe some of you do.
[92:32.31]I don't know what this is supposed to convey.
[92:33.49]Uh...
[92:51.81]No shoes on.
[92:53.98]No shoes on with a plastic bat.
[93:02.22]The pitcher is going into the motion of throwing the ball and I'm not fucking ready?
[93:15.29]Here's the back of the card.
[93:17.49]Jeremy Elbertson, Boston Red Sox, hometown Boston, Massachusetts, positions Shortstop.
[93:23.15]After rage-quitting tennis, Elbertson made his way to the realm of professional baseball with an all-time batting average of .001, which actually means I probably got walked once in 10,000 at-bats.
[93:41.05]Well, no, batting average.
[93:41.93]That means I accidentally, like, bunted.
[93:43.65]Not on base percentage.
[93:45.33]Okay.
[93:45.75]Jeremy's only major league hit was a walk-off grand slam that won the Red Sox the World Series last year.
[93:51.21]Last year.
[93:58.71]When asked about the historic moment, club manager Alex Costa said, Look, this guy wasn't even supposed to be on the team.
[94:06.29]David Ortiz got the flu and we just had to pick some dickhead from the crowd.
[94:10.61]Who even are you?
[94:11.61]How did you get into the locker room?
[94:19.06]Did somebody link that video of me hitting the two grand slams?
[94:22.24]That's like my favorite video.
[94:24.58]Where's the video of me doing the two big home runs?
[94:26.76]That's like, that's my favorite video on YouTube.
[94:31.35]Where is it?
[94:32.03]I have to- I'm gonna queue it up for the video portion.
[94:34.25]I love that video so much.
[94:35.67]Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[94:47.40]Is this it?
[94:54.17]Sign in to confirm your age.
[94:55.35]Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[94:56.49]Give me the real video.
[95:02.58]It's not in either.
[95:03.14]Why are you guys so unhelpful sometimes?
[95:10.63]Right here.
[95:11.17]Right here.
[95:23.28]No, that's not the one.
[95:24.32]This is not the right one.
[95:25.76]There's two.
[95:27.79]There's two.
[95:28.63]I'm going to show them both.
[95:31.57]I love this song.
[95:32.31]No.
[95:32.77]I don't.
[95:33.45]Stop linking me this video.
[95:35.01]I know.
[95:35.35]I said that 15 years ago.
[95:37.22]I know.
[95:37.58]Alright.
[95:39.82]Where's the one that's the two?
[95:41.16]Fucking god.
[95:45.96]How unhelpful.
[95:53.72]No.
[95:54.18]This is.
[95:54.54]What are you doing?
[96:01.85]No, I can see, I've memorized the Rick Roll one now.

[97:05.14]Alright.
[97:06.68]Okay, that only took fucking like six straight minutes.
[97:16.39]I like this.
[97:27.31]Bye, Bulldog.
[97:29.22]Good shit.
[97:32.02]Show the video.
[97:32.52]I'm going to put it in this whole video portion that's coming up in like probably 30 minutes.
[97:37.44]I'm not going to show it.
[97:38.02]I got it.
[97:38.24]It's right.
[97:38.69]I got it.
[97:38.97]There's a whole video portion.
[97:41.51]Just... That one's free.
[97:55.30]I almost instinctively just fucking clicked the X.
[98:06.98]Look at those, look at those bumps.
[98:11.39]Jerma bumpy.
[98:12.45]Look at those bumps.
[98:17.61]Alright, click the X, click this.
[98:19.09]Jeff, thank you, thank you.
[98:20.83]Rhode Island, Jeff.
[98:22.43]Thank you.
[98:23.61]Oh, this, another one, another one, another one I want to get rid of, another one.
[98:26.42]I don't like the veins in the eyes, I don't like the eyes.
[98:27.98]This is, alright.
[98:39.18]That's fucking really good art, though.
[98:41.30]Really good art by Irakli.
[98:43.72]OD, thank you.
[98:45.44]Hotline Miami?
[98:49.77]Ooh, look at this one!
[98:51.29]This one's good.
[98:51.85]This is by Teens again.
[98:54.89]I'm gonna get out of the way so you can see the whole thing.
[99:04.18]Christmas.
[99:05.36]It's pretty much every major holiday terrain this year.
[99:10.94]Jeremy, you look like Harrison Ford.
[99:13.24]That's a compliment.
[99:14.30]I'll take it.
[99:18.25]Motion blur.
[99:18.97]Yeah, that's a pretty good touch.
[99:20.15]Those of you that might be new viewers, I, in point blank two, I did the bonus round, which is nearly impossible for any humans to do.
[99:29.45]You have to shoot 30 targets that are in a line in five seconds.
[99:35.83]Humans actually can't do this.
[99:39.67]I did it.
[99:45.62]You didn't do it.
[99:46.76]Fine.
[99:47.38]I didn't.
[99:48.60]Somebody else did, but they live in my same body, so that's fine.
[99:53.58]The humans can't do it.
[99:55.50]They connected it to a fucking computer, and finally, like, scientists were all gathered around.
[99:59.30]They were like, holy shit, we actually can do it now.
[100:02.23]And then I showed up.
[100:05.87]Or a person that lives in my head did.
[100:08.91]No, it's not me.
[100:09.49]His name's Jackson.
[100:24.58]love this I want this I want to sell this but not this you know what I mean you know sometimes streamers and YouTubers do oh we're gonna do pops oh yeah I'm gonna get a pop made of me a little figure and it's gonna be me going like but like no I don't want that I don't want just like a wreck no no I want this I want this to be sold I want that to be me
[100:58.67]I don't want it to be like a pup.
[101:00.39]I want to sell something like this and have it just be supposed to be me.
[101:09.75]3D printed.
[101:14.42]U2s it.
[101:16.26]What is U2s?
[101:19.45]U2 sounds like... Like, I feel like there's like a... Like a... It's not like a dot-com after that.
[101:24.51]That's like a fake YouTube.
[101:26.11]Like, accidentally have people click on something.
[101:28.45]U2s dot what?
[101:39.02]That's like a... They make... They make pop vinyls for YouTubers.
[101:44.12]Oh.
[101:47.38]Oh, okay.
[101:47.76]Okay.
[101:49.94]Funko Pop for YouTubers.
[101:55.28]How expensive are they?
[102:04.08]Actual porn links in chat.
[102:05.34]Am I clicking on anything?
[102:06.36]I got plenty of links already queued up here.
[102:15.31]Got the smirk down.
[102:19.10]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[102:21.38]I am going to personally come in here and time this person up.
[102:25.00]I can't even because I can't do that.
[102:27.68]Physically, I can't even right click in here.
[102:34.65]Broadcast software that I'm using.
[102:37.81]I haven't changed.
[102:38.75]This is my own fault.
[102:40.10]Alright.
[102:49.74]Very good work.
[102:50.80]Very clean.
[102:52.12]I'm pogging, Jerma, please.
[102:53.54]Relax.
[102:55.06]Hold it in.
[102:57.94]Hold it until the video section.
[103:03.42]Jerma, please.
[103:04.02]What?
[103:04.40]What?
[103:05.02]What did I just do?
[103:07.24]Hold it in!
[103:08.84]I thought, like, by my breath, I'm pogging.
[103:12.18]Hold... Ah, whatever.
[103:13.36]I don't care.
[103:15.12]This is good shit, though.
[103:17.13]Really nice work.
[103:24.61]This is a depiction of the Halloween stream.
[103:29.20]When, uh... Pukleberry was doing something and... That's fucking funny.
[103:42.49]Free me?
[103:45.29]Some of you that might have not seen the Halloween stream, there was a segment where B.F. Bugleberry, who's a very well-liked character, did a pottery class.
[103:55.52]To you, to you.
[103:57.34]To people watching.
[103:58.00]There was a segment on that stream.
[104:00.62]And the stream had 8,000 or 9,000 concurrent people watching it.
[104:08.75]And after about 20 to 30 seconds of this character being on screen doing the pottery, this is not a joke.
[104:14.97]This is not me making this up and embellishing it with like, oh, look how funny, that's fake.
[104:19.73]Of 3,000 concurrent people left.
[104:20.99]3,000 concurrent people dumped deep fucking immediately.
[104:32.10]It was an unbearable segment.
[104:46.99]it was the reverb I know it was a lot of things but yes this is I love this this is by uh needles and noodles you can't see it was the audio and I didn't even know it's alright I'm gonna never forget that
[105:06.66]Somebody just shit my pants.
[105:09.44]Also from the Halloween stream when I looked slime.
[105:17.11]I do remember that.
[105:18.83]It was a very, very uncomfortable feeling.
[105:22.57]Did not feel very good.
[105:27.67]By the way... You know like when you look at yourself in pictures or in the mirror or something...
[105:35.03]I feel like that's what I see in the mirror.
[105:37.71]You know what I mean?
[105:38.39]Like, there are days when I'm like... Like... No, I don't have a bald fucking head.
[105:45.34]It's the way my hair is parted.
[105:46.38]It's black.
[105:48.63]See?
[105:50.61]Oh, it's nothing, but it's also everything.
[105:52.09]By the way, don't be bald or small.
[106:19.64]Because we'll hear about it every day.
[106:23.68]Anyways.
[106:30.67]Someone just shit my pants.
[106:35.61]Bald.
[106:36.07]Bald.
[106:36.95]It gets funnier every time.
[106:45.05]The music just changed to angry.
[106:46.88]It's like...
[106:55.69]Ah, okay, back to normal.
[106:56.69]Back to what we were doing.
[106:57.87]Community content night.
[107:00.23]Oy yi yi.
[107:01.61]Alright, this is just like, this is just a spray paint tool.
[107:04.65]This is just spray paint.
[107:15.18]This is pretty good.
[107:16.32]This is pretty good.

[107:43.39]Geranium.
[107:46.91]I can't even... The chat is going too fast.
[107:49.69]Ger...
[107:52.27]I can't read it.
[107:53.31]It's going too fast for me to read it.
[107:55.11]Germanium.
[107:56.07]Germanium.
[107:57.67]Germanium.
[107:59.61]Pretty cool.

[108:19.47]No, that don't work.
[108:20.47]If I scroll chat, if I scroll up, scroll up, it comes, rips back down.
[108:24.79]Scroll up, rips back down.
[108:25.87]It happens.
[108:26.23]Trust me.
[108:29.79]On my way to have a fun hangout.
[108:32.39]Okay, cool.
[108:35.72]Alright.

[108:40.16]Yeah, okay, cool.
[108:40.96]Nice job, everybody.
[108:49.87]This is from The Sims.
[108:53.43]He's sick of us.
[108:54.29]No.
[108:58.01]No, I'm not.
[109:02.59]I mean, that did come off.
[109:03.91]That did come off as, like, over it.
[109:06.45]But I assure you, I'm not.
[109:09.89]I just, like, I know that's what's gonna happen.
[109:12.23]I know I'm gonna look over it.
[109:13.55]I'm just saying it for you.
[109:15.31]I'm doing it.
[109:16.03]I'm saying it for you.
[109:17.85]You don't have to say it.
[109:20.22]He hates streaming.
[109:24.60]Do not.
[109:26.34]You wink and then you leave.
[109:30.33]Why are you stealing our jokes?
[109:33.95]I'm here too, man.
[109:35.93]It can't be me.
[109:38.67]I made this.
[109:40.23]I made this.
[109:46.14]No, it was me.
[109:46.88]No, it wasn't.
[109:47.42]It was me.
[109:48.24]I did this.
[109:50.59]My eye's at you again.
[109:56.59]No, you know who actually did this?
[109:57.81]It was Rhode Island!
[110:01.23]You didn't make this, neither did I. We have to unionize now.
[110:07.32]You guys are gonna unionize?
[110:10.86]We're gonna unionize.
[110:13.92]It was the whole state of Rhode Island.
[110:18.91]Why is my eye so itchy?
[110:20.41]Oh, I'm gonna get something mad!
[110:21.35]Oh, I'm gonna get something mad!
[110:24.90]What?
[110:27.90]So, so... It's going too fast.
[110:36.46]Take a Benadryl.
[110:37.56]Oh, take a Benadryl.
[110:44.75]Oh, I'm gonna take a fucking Benadryl.
[110:48.65]Help, my 6k viewers have unionized.
[110:52.58]What the fuck would that even mean?
[110:54.10]This is awesome though, I love this.
[110:58.20]Thank you.
[110:58.55]This is from The Thing.
[111:15.06]Oh, I keep having flashbacks of that.
[111:16.98]That particular scene inside of the vent.
[111:20.54]God, that game was fucking ridiculous.
[111:25.32]Maybe I am going to... I don't own Benadryl.
[111:30.16]Benadryl is a medicine that your parents have in the house, but you don't.
[111:33.99]You know what I mean?
[111:34.59]I don't have Benadryl.
[111:36.29]I have Tylenol and NyQuil.
[111:45.60]This is fantastic, though.
[111:47.36]I love this a lot.
[111:50.57]Test him.
[111:51.35]Test that guy.
[111:54.97]Test him.
[111:56.59]Make sure we can see the artist's name.
[112:00.49]If we do, we can.
[112:03.38]If you take too much NyQuil... Wait, hold on.
[112:06.32]If you take too much, you'll start seeing spiders.
[112:08.82]Omega Lull.
[112:13.69]Take too much of what?
[112:23.19]Giant enemy spider.
[112:24.23]Benadryl.
[112:24.75]Is that real?
[112:28.69]Omega LOL?
[112:29.84]What?
[112:32.10]Fog champ.
[112:34.30]Jax.
[112:34.58]I have a Jax.
[112:35.46]Oh, this is supposed to be my smile.
[112:43.00]God damn it.
[112:46.98]How did you know I was going to do this?
[112:56.11]Thank you, Todd.

[113:43.67]Good stuff.
[113:45.42]So you're going to notice there's probably going to be a little bit of Christmas or a lot of Christmas related stuff in here.
[113:49.64]I'm sure you've seen a couple already.
[113:50.96]That's because I didn't do a community content night in December.
[113:54.28]So this is like all of November into like the middle of the end middle of December.
[114:02.05]So that's kind of where the cutoff is here.

[119:14.86]There might be.
[119:15.28]You're looking at us, huh?
[119:18.26]Is it because we're dentists?
[119:20.88]From the Outer Worlds stream.
[119:28.83]Arguably the best part of that game were the dentists that weren't even actually real.
[119:36.42]We made them up.

[121:52.59]What am I supposed to do?
[121:54.38]I can't...
[122:01.05]I don't touch it.
[122:01.69]Alright, I won't touch it anymore, but what am I supposed to do?

[122:07.97]Pour water in it.

[122:48.03]God, I love those old, uh, light gun games.
[122:53.26]This is so fun.
[122:55.52]You have to play them on a TV, and that TV was such a pain in the ass.
[123:00.83]Once that TV got in that room, I couldn't fucking ever get it out until I moved across the country.
[123:11.21]But it's so fun to play them.
[123:13.29]I wish I could have captured it better, but you kind of can't.
[123:20.93]Delete this emote.
[123:24.89]This is awesome though.
[123:26.91]It's like painted.
[123:27.77]It looks like a painting.
[123:32.89]Floating around the universe.

[124:22.32]This giant rat.
[124:27.37]Plano Farmer comes to New York City to deliver fresh produce.
[124:34.76]This does look like the front of a cereal box.
[124:41.14]Like, if this is a strawberry, this is a marshmallow sugary cereal.
[124:48.10]And it could be called, like, Plano Farmer-O's or something.
[124:52.90]Tomato cereal.

[126:07.88]This is very well done.
[126:09.40]Very well made.
[126:10.12]This is by Appleshift.
[126:20.77]A small, incredibly highly detailed animated short here.
[126:34.41]Take on me.
[126:37.51]This is very, very, very good.
[126:40.13]This probably took a very long time to make.
[126:43.71]Each one of these images is as high-detailed as the last one.
[126:50.75]Thank you, Appleship.
[126:51.47]This is fantastic work.
[126:54.45]Why is he so mad?
[126:55.61]Wait, what is this?
[126:56.11]Why are you flipping this?
[126:58.51]What is this?
[126:59.75]Why play this right now?
[127:00.73]This makes no sense.
[127:01.35]I don't get it.
[127:02.76]Sad!
[127:17.02]Oh, right, right, right.
[127:22.17]This was during Monster Rancher?
[127:24.05]Why is this so sad to this part here?
[127:28.79]Monster Rancher 4 is when this happened.
[127:31.04]That game doesn't exist in my brain.

[128:22.82]God, this is fucking crazy.
[128:26.40]Mom did not get me an ice cream cone, except this time I'm a bowling elf.
[128:33.65]Apologize for this.
[128:39.76]The Roblox guy?
[128:42.18]Why?
[128:45.95]Good stuff.
[128:52.23]This is the same image on the screen.
[129:02.01]This is the wireframe of this.
[129:06.88]You know what I mean?
[129:07.56]This is the same exact image.
[129:16.02]You look like the guy from Gorillaz.
[129:21.59]Murdock?
[129:24.27]New Gorillaz member.
[129:29.13]Yeah, I get some Murdock vibes from this image, I do.
[129:34.18]Of course I know, that's like my favorite band.

[130:11.29]I don't understand why he's wanted because he killed snowman here's your real facecam don't worry I'm just winking in this image
[130:46.20]I don't know why I thought for one second that this hair was photoshopped on.
[130:51.88]I did not think this was real hair for a second.
[130:53.60]I was like, what's wrong with this hair?
[130:56.31]You pulled hair from somebody's ass and put it on here.
[131:01.83]This is the only part that's photoshopped.
[131:04.15]I'm wearing a wig.
[131:09.72]Nice work.
[131:16.50]Oh, look at this.
[131:19.56]Coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.
[131:25.77]That's what they were for Halloween.
[131:36.33]Group costume.
[131:44.75]Hey, that's an easy costume, though.
[131:46.46]That's cheap.
[131:47.50]Doesn't cost any money.
[131:50.60]Well, I mean, yeah, it did.
[131:52.62]I'm talking about, like, this one.
[131:55.24]It's just... Yeah, it did.
[131:58.31]This is, like, an expensive costume.
[132:00.49]I just saw the coffee with, like, a tag.
[132:04.01]Like, a sticker that says coffee on it.
[132:06.35]Well, that was a cheap costume.
[132:08.38]Guy in chicken suit.
[132:11.89]Left to right, Jeremy.
[132:13.51]We go left to right.
[132:18.28]I love this, though.
[132:19.14]This is awesome.
[132:21.94]I can't believe three Jerma fans know each other in real life.
[132:29.21]Say it.
[132:29.51]I already did.
[132:30.03]I said, coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[132:35.87]Here you go.
[132:38.86]I am... I'll be honest with you, though.
[132:40.78]I am absolutely shocked and floored and surprised by the fact that people think this is so interesting or so funny or they've taken it and it's something that they like to a point that they're gonna do a Halloween costume based off of it.
[132:54.72]That's just, like, fun.
[132:56.38]Thanks for that.
[132:57.91]Thank you for thinking that's that funny.
[133:00.89]Thanks for thinking that that's that interesting.
[133:05.41]Because it's...
[133:08.93]This makes me happy.
[133:09.91]I'm glad you think it's fun.
[133:13.39]Grandma, I just made lobster rolls.
[133:19.06]Nice.
[133:23.40]Good work.
[133:35.26]Gotta do something with Fireman.
[133:36.92]I gotta get in touch with the person responsible for making Fireman.
[133:41.86]Because it's... You guys love Fireman.
[133:47.35]There's gotta be some opportunity to do something with Fireman.
[133:52.71]Not a t-shirt.
[133:53.69]Something else.
[134:02.51]Steal the rights from them.
[134:05.81]No, no.
[134:07.11]I actually talked to the person that did that drawing.
[134:10.37]And we already agreed on that it wouldn't just be, alright, thanks for the fucking thing that everybody in the community likes.
[134:16.35]Bye, thanks for the money.
[134:17.29]No.
[134:17.97]It would be very fair to them.
[134:22.54]As fair as I could possibly make it.
[134:24.22]Because, I mean, people just love this shit, you know?
[134:34.32]Make it a plush toy.
[134:35.90]I'll have to look into these.
[134:42.00]That sounds like the Mafia.
[134:43.14]I'm gonna make it as fair as I possibly can.
[134:49.19]Yeah, that does sound like bad.
[134:50.63]No, no, no, no, no.
[134:52.31]I've made it very... I said I've made it... Hold on.
[134:55.31]That's bad.
[134:56.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[134:57.51]No, no.
[134:57.91]I've already talked to him.
[134:58.91]I've already talked to him.
[134:59.69]And I made it real clear to him.
[135:01.74]Made it real clear.
[135:03.50]That's gonna be real fair to them.
[135:06.50]To let me use that image.
[135:07.84]Real fair to you.
[135:09.16]I made it real clear.
[135:11.76]Jesus.
[135:13.36]No, I mean... I mean they're gonna get paid.
[135:19.52]Sounds fucking horrible.
[135:25.03]Paid.
[135:25.65]No, paid in money.
[135:29.11]Paid?
[135:29.67]No, paid in cash.
[135:34.73]This is fantastic, though.
[135:36.30]Good work.
[135:38.82]I love the bright, sunny, kind of shiny look.
[135:42.90]Very good job.
[135:47.80]It's like they... It's like they can hear us talking!
[135:54.96]I swear to God, I load these images up.
[135:58.27]And I just... Go, go, go.
[135:59.87]I put them in a row.
[136:00.57]I have not, like, gone through all of these.
[136:03.73]I load them up.
[136:04.91]I... I don't know.
[136:07.01]I swear to God.
[136:10.81]Paid and laundered money.
[136:12.34]Well, here it is.
[136:13.06]This is what it might... Could potentially maybe look like in the future.
[136:16.70]I don't know.
[136:18.10]Give us this.
[136:19.16]This is not mine.
[136:20.88]Somebody owns this.
[136:21.86]I love it.
[136:30.70]That's awesome.
[136:33.85]Iron Man is a currency.
[136:38.23]Legendary.
[136:38.77]Yeah.
[136:39.07]Legend.
[136:51.31]The grin.
[136:53.85]Pretty good grin.
[136:56.55]We can see the who made it, right?
[136:57.91]There we go.
[137:05.83]Say the line.
[137:07.95]Thanos?
[137:08.45]No.
[137:09.19]I'm not Thanos.
[137:09.79]I never will be Thanos.
[137:11.85]And why would I want to be Thanos?
[137:13.13]I want to be Spider-Man.
[137:24.38]This is from Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion.
[137:30.48]I hope that's in the game.
[137:32.04]Is it real?
[137:32.62]I don't know.
[137:33.00]Is it?
[137:35.77]That would be really funny if it was.
[137:37.51]Uh, Vilemi just dropped 30 subs.
[137:44.13]30 community subs from Vilemi.
[137:47.43]Thank you, Vilemi.
[137:49.13]Huge sub drop from Vilemi.
[137:55.52]Thank you.
[137:58.54]Congratulations to those that now can spam JirbaTV.
[138:04.20]That's a lot of subs.
[138:05.62]So many fucking community subs.
[138:10.76]Team TV.
[138:11.62]Now I can't delete it.

[138:22.47]Of Ella and Kitchacat.
[138:30.18]I love you, Jerma.
[138:31.56]Get well soon.
[138:32.56]Love, Ella.
[138:36.26]This is so precious.
[138:42.76]This is so precious.
[138:44.88]I just hope that... I just hope that she doesn't watch when I talk about shitting my pants.
[138:55.77]Hope she just sees the fireman content.
[139:00.64]family content you just ruined a moment there but now you have something with common with them this is so cute this is adorable I'm telling you fireman's gonna be worth millions fireman's gonna be worth millions

[140:37.55]Ugh.
[140:37.93]That's from one of the DOS streams when we played, what's it called, like Treasure Hunter or something?
[140:49.44]Treasure Catcher?
[140:50.40]Treasure Grab?
[140:52.78]Whatever it is.
[141:02.39]This is very zoomed in.
[141:05.21]This is very zoomed in.
[141:07.69]Video game time!
[141:30.93]Got my nice slicked back villain hair that I have during conferences.
[141:34.71]You guys are good at teeth, I'm telling you.
[141:45.28]This is like the third or fourth image that has really good teeth.
[141:51.02]I like this.
[141:54.94]I got more hair than that, though.
[141:55.98]That's not fair.
[141:58.20]I've got more hair than that.
[142:00.45]It's thinning, but I still have more than that.
[142:07.23]And finally, for the image section.
[142:09.13]Uh, you've reached comedy level two.
[142:12.77]Jeremy can now tell a knock-knock joke to other Sims.
[142:23.26]Pretty good.
[142:24.86]That's it for the art.
[142:25.54]We're gonna move on to the videos now.
[142:28.84]And I'm gonna go just, let me just rinse my eye.
[142:31.14]Because we're gonna move on to the video portion.
[142:35.82]Thank you everybody again for your artwork.
[142:37.10]That was part one.
[142:38.20]There's still about 20 days or so of stuff that's from the last 20 days.
[142:42.95]We'll be doing that next week.
[142:44.83]So, thank you everybody for your contributions, your artwork, your videos, which we're about to see.
[142:51.79]And, yeah.
[142:52.91]You guys are fucking talented.
[142:55.44]I'm glad to showcase talented people.
[142:56.98]It's a lot of fun.
[142:57.53]So, it's time for a pee break.
[142:59.73]Time to wash your eyes.
[143:01.79]And I'll be right back.
[143:03.17]We'll keep going. ...
[143:56.58]Thank you.
[145:06.42]Thank you.
[145:58.75]okay hello everybody we're going to move on to the videos there are let's see
[146:33.17]50?
[146:34.75]40 to 50?
[146:35.23]Maybe 50 videos?
[146:36.17]40 videos?
[146:38.59]Big bits just came in.
[146:41.77]Even more money contributed to this stream.
[146:43.36]Thank you.
[146:44.12]Thank you to Jatooty Jabooty for $100 in bits.
[146:48.02]10,000 bits.
[146:52.78]10,000.
[146:52.82]Thank you.
[146:54.24]Grandma, I love you and your community so much.
[146:55.72]I never want you to stop.
[146:56.68]This is the only fraction.
[146:57.97]This is only a fraction of the money that you deserve.
[147:03.02]Oh, let me stop you there for a second.
[147:09.42]I don't have any plans on stopping.
[147:13.02]Right?
[147:14.39]But I've told you guys this before.
[147:15.63]As long as I'm having fun, then I'm going to keep doing it.
[147:22.11]That's it.
[147:24.41]I'm never going to force myself to do any of this.
[147:28.20]Because then it becomes genuine.
[147:33.00]But I'm still having fun.
[147:34.48]And I'm going to continue to probably have fun for a long time.
[147:37.93]But just know, I need to stay interested.
[147:40.25]I want to stay interested.
[147:41.15]Because I don't want to just do it because I want to or I have to.
[147:43.67]You know what I'm saying?
[147:47.24]That's like two more weeks of streams.
[147:50.40]No, but that's... That means a lot.
[147:52.58]And then they say, Uh... You deserve this for the countless hours of entertainment you've given me and my friends.
[147:58.04]I think I have seriously watched Ask Nicely for Crits and Pulling It Off with the Pump Brothers 500 times each.
[148:05.79]Sorry that I'm not able to make it here more often.
[148:08.67]Love you.
[148:09.03]Wish you the best of luck with all your future projects.
[148:11.19]P.S.
[148:11.53]Chat has a nice booty.
[148:18.99]Well, thank you.
[148:22.38]Uh, hold on.
[148:24.46]We gotta wait for the car to drive by.
[148:25.58]Uh, never apologize for not being able to make streams.
[148:30.40]Some of these go very long, and they go deep into the night, and they happen more than a few times a week, so don't feel like you're obligated to have to be here.
[148:41.49]I know that's asked a lot.
[148:42.51]It asks a lot of people to be like, oh yeah, just spend 40 plus hours, 20 to 40 hours a week with me.
[148:50.68]No, people have things to do.
[148:52.24]They have things to come up.
[148:54.93]You don't have to be here if you don't want to.
[148:57.21]You speak very fast.
[148:58.57]Do I?
[148:58.81]Do I speak really fast?
[149:00.63]Do I slow down a little?
[149:05.57]In the future, I'm going to slow it down.
[149:07.97]So from here on out, my voice is going to be at a speed that's minus 4% from here on out.
[149:13.63]Okay, good.
[149:17.35]But no, thanks a lot, Djibouti.
[149:20.79]Anybody that's watched a video like I've made that many times, it surprises me every time somebody says it.
[149:29.90]Thanks for the $100.
[149:32.18]Back to it.
[149:39.47]uh we're going to the video portion now as you can see incorrect no spoilers up top I don't want you to see the spoilers okay this first one is called a Stardew Valley has to stop playing
[150:02.43]Alright, here we go.
[150:03.91]I'm gonna go off-cam for these because I'd rather we experience it together rather than me have my face covering up a bunch of it, so let's go.
[150:10.35]It's called Animated.
[150:11.13]I mean, we're talking mainly bugs.
[150:14.62]When I say we're talking bugs, guys, we're talking like grasshoppers, ants, beetles, spiders.
[150:23.84]Would you eat a spider?
[150:26.36]I wouldn't.
[150:29.50]See, like, ants are one thing, just regular black ants.
[150:33.16]Not like fire ants, just regular ants.
[150:37.74]I feel like it wouldn't be that huge of a deal to me.
[150:42.74]If I knew they were clean, it was like there were three doctors and two scientists that were standing around in a circle around me while I was about to eat it.
[150:53.08]And all of them are just like, yeah, that's delicious.
[150:55.32]You go ahead.
[150:56.32]The nutritional value is off the charts and it's great.
[150:59.45]It's better for you than eating an apple.
[151:02.23]Maybe, I don't know.
[151:06.81]One of those scientists says it might not be a good idea.
[151:09.61]It's gone.
[151:20.80]Alright, where is this supposed to be?
[151:22.96]Wait, what?
[151:30.25]What happened here?
[151:38.79]That was a long time ago.
[151:44.98]Wait, that was a very, very long time ago.
[151:51.01]I thought I... Didn't I talk about this, like, not even two months ago?
[152:02.25]Holy shit.
[152:03.35]What a weirdo.
[152:08.96]On to the next one!
[152:09.82]That was pretty good, though.
[152:10.84]That was pretty good animation.
[152:17.14]Wait, hold on.
[152:17.75]There's another one?
[152:18.59]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[152:19.29]There's another one?
[152:21.71]I'm confused here.
[152:22.50]Wait a minute.
[152:31.12]We're talking mainly bugs.
[152:33.14]When I say, we're talking bugs, guys.
[152:34.86]We're talking... Why is there another one of these?
[152:37.81]Like grasshoppers, ants, beetles, spiders.
[152:42.39]Would you eat a spider?
[152:44.91]I wouldn't.
[152:47.29]Wait, why is this coming back?
[152:51.03]Why is this coming back?
[152:52.53]It's a Jerma985 teaser animation.
[152:57.79]When I say, we're talking bugs, guys.
[152:59.51]We're talking... Why are my ears that big?
[153:08.70]There's no spoilers!
[153:09.52]No spoilers!
[153:14.92]Alright, that was... This one's called Jerma Dream.
[153:26.77]Siri, take a note.
[153:28.35]No, no.
[153:28.69]What's the note?
[153:30.27]Inside of a cave.
[153:33.33]Sharing two sticks with a guy.
[153:35.19]Some homeless guy.
[153:37.29]Threw up in his mouth.
[153:39.22]Mickey Mouse comes in.
[153:41.34]And drains all my battery from my iPod.
[153:45.02]I kiss him.
[153:47.36]Siri, take a note.
[153:55.07]I think this is a dream thing.
[153:57.26]I think that's a dream that somebody did somebody have that dream or
[154:06.57]I don't know.
[154:07.43]Take a note.
[154:08.87]What's the note?
[154:10.43]Inside of a cave.
[154:13.51]Sharing two sticks with a guy, some homeless guy.
[154:17.47]Threw up in his mouth.
[154:19.39]Mickey Mouse comes in and drains all my battery from my iPod.
[154:25.20]I kiss him.
[154:26.12]You were talking about keeping a dream journal and how fucking weird it is.
[154:30.56]Yeah, I see.
[154:31.68]I feel you.
[154:37.49]This one is called Jerma in Star Wars.
[154:45.95]I feel like I'm in fucking Star Wars.
[154:47.55]I ain't slowing down for nothing.
[154:57.62]What?
[154:58.70]What the fuck?
[155:00.88]What?
[155:01.58]You just put the music.
[155:05.14]It's just the music.
[155:07.35]I think I just ripped out the code.
[155:12.44]Stormtrooper.
[155:18.56]Alright, moving right along.
[155:22.81]This one's called 1985.
[155:28.01]The ideal set up by the party was something huge, terrible, and glittering.
[155:32.67]A world of steel and concrete, of monsters, machines, and terrifying weapons.
[155:36.89]A nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting, 300 million people all with the same face.
[155:55.36]Mike Tyson, the hardest puncher ever.
[155:57.46]Imagine getting punched in the face by Mike Tyson.
[156:05.58]This is awesome.
[156:06.50]Except for these guys here.
[156:08.08]Those are the two main characters.
[156:29.42]300 million people all with the same face.
[156:34.49]Jesus Christ.
[156:39.05]This one's called The Jerma Showdown.
[156:42.15]I think we may have seen this at the end of a stream.
[156:44.17]I think I put it on one time, but it's probably worth seeing again.
[156:47.24]Maybe we haven't.
[156:48.36]Maybe something similar.
[156:53.22]You're going down.
[157:18.34]This is so stupid.
[157:20.34]What a loser.
[157:28.38]Wait, it was an ambassador body shot?
[157:33.41]An ambassador body shot.
[157:38.23]Holy shit, that's fucking funny.
[157:50.01]uh this one's called just waters of nazareth whatever that means oh
[158:26.53]Pretty good.
[158:28.06]Pretty good.
[158:30.20]My first encounter with Jerma.
[158:32.74]My first encounter with him.
[158:53.43]This is what it looks like if somebody were to make my whole face out of paper.
[158:58.45]My entire body is made out of very delicate paper.
[159:01.31]And your mother packs it into your backpack.
[159:05.25]But doesn't really put the care necessary into making sure it doesn't get ruined.
[159:10.02]And then you take this out in class.
[159:13.22]And you're like, mom.
[159:15.76]What the?
[159:16.84]Mom, why did you put it in here?
[159:18.70]I told you I wanted to carry it.
[159:20.22]And she was like, you're not carrying that.
[159:21.88]It's too delicate.
[159:28.85]And then you have to have everybody see this.
[159:33.43]So you're implying that you're my homework.
[159:36.26]In a sense.
[159:37.20]In a sense, you know.
[159:40.94]This is called a crude pre-stream thesis.
[159:44.58]This is a song.
[159:46.10]This is from Neon Genesis Evangelion.
[159:49.72]But it's a custom song.
[159:53.42]Apparently.
[159:55.30]Let's see.
[159:56.83]Let's hear it.
[160:00.02]I pronounced it correctly, of course I did.
[160:02.88]A short streamer with crude yet genuine content
[160:36.53]So it is custom lyrics, too.
[160:38.25]Alright, let's see it.
[160:39.10]Let's hear it, man.
[160:57.58]There's good folks who will help with your questions.
[161:01.38]They're totally chill, but they take a back seat.
[161:05.08]When someone says feet, the one-track mind will take the lead.
[161:11.39]If you're a mod, then you pray to your god and just hope that it stays safe for work.
[161:18.37]No inhibition and joke repetition are two reasons why people learn.
[161:27.73]That was awesome That was awesome
[162:02.70]Y'all didn't want to give that one a chance until it got started.
[162:15.68]Gift this person a sub for crying out loud.
[162:21.44]Nice work.
[162:24.52]That was really, really, really good.
[162:32.33]There it is!
[162:33.43]Somebody did it.
[162:36.14]Clap, clap, clap, clap.
[162:38.08]Claps all around.
[162:39.14]Uh, this one is called, uh, Jerma Wars?
[162:44.04]A Star Wars one?
[162:45.83]Hopefully, uh, there's not- Alright, if you've never seen Star Wars before, there might be a Star Wars clip in here.
[162:50.33]Uh, if you've never seen Star Wars, I- I guess it might be a Star Wars clip.
[162:56.20]Can I show this one?
[162:57.64]I think it's just like a joke, right?
[162:59.70]Alright, the Star Wars coming up.
[163:01.18]Here comes the Star Wars one.
[163:21.79]This is like...
[163:25.40]We got a grenade?
[163:56.16]I'm going down.
[163:57.82]I'm going down?
[163:58.94]No I'm not!
[163:59.52]We're fine!
[164:00.26]Here, I'm right behind you.
[164:23.01]Yeah, well, I moved here when I was probably 19.
[164:28.27]Oh, shit, sorry, yeah, sorry.
[164:34.92]We've got to give those fighters more time.
[164:37.26]Concentrate all fire on that superstar destroyer.
[164:46.34]Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.
[164:48.54]Intensify the forward... Nothing is obvious.
[165:05.01]Wait, hold on.
[165:06.21]You can't just end it like that.
[165:07.63]You can't just end it like that.
[165:09.03]You can't just end it like that.
[165:15.75]I fall before the explosion happens.
[165:24.89]explosion I fall twice okay my stomach hurts what happened look at the title Jerma wars return to the two minute max run time this is gonna be like five minutes long so I had to make some big adjustments laughing

[168:45.36]All of us have seen this video now.
[168:46.88]Right?
[168:47.56]Alright, let's go.
[168:48.16]And you have the money to spend.
[168:49.76]I would get rid of one of these.
[168:52.26]I would make a statement.
[168:54.92]And if you're wondering what I'm talking about here, I'm talking about a real statement.
[168:59.49]A seafood.
[169:01.51]Gold.
[169:07.67]Why would that be the cutest?
[169:09.69]Why would this be the cutest fucking thing you've ever seen?
[169:22.19]God.
[169:27.75]This is called Rant Wasp and the Man.
[169:31.11]Rant Wasp and the Man, apparently.
[169:38.09]So I think the thing about...
[169:40.50]Um, I think eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[169:43.30]Oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, hold on.
[169:45.72]There he is, wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[169:50.98]Okay, he landed.
[169:55.10]Ooh, up in smoke!
[170:01.36]The roles have been reversed.
[170:03.04]Yes, they have.
[170:06.74]Who cares if I even show spoilers?
[170:08.14]There's no spoilers to see.
[170:13.01]This is worth showing again.
[170:14.23]It is.
[170:15.82]This was shown at the very end of the stream one night.
[170:19.20]And it's fucking hilarious.
[170:20.20]So this is a wager fulfilled pepper.
[170:24.83]No, no, please no!
[170:34.13]I'm trying to turn the... No!
[170:36.88]I'm trying to turn it!
[170:38.62]If I go into the black hole one more time, I'll eat a ghost pepperon spring.
[170:44.33]You know what I mean?
[170:45.03]Like, that's the kind of shit I need to make sure I don't do.
[170:47.67]Wouldn't that destroy my stomach?
[170:49.15]Yeah, so I better not go in the black hole!
[171:04.45]I do not stress.
[171:36.14]I got time.
[171:37.28]This has to go off.
[171:38.91]This has to go off.
[171:42.57]Uh, this next one... Eh, whatever.
[171:45.51]Just play it.
[171:49.04]Play it.
[171:50.88]Oh, no!
[171:51.20]My C drive!
[171:52.30]C!
[171:52.76]Jeremy!
[171:53.22]Downloads!
[171:54.06]Oh, fuck!
[172:12.07]There is no sound.
[172:17.38]What do you think this is?
[172:19.38]Yeah.
[172:22.22]Some madman made this.
[172:29.59]And also made this.
[172:40.50]I'm not sure whether to be happy or to be very upset about this.
[172:46.67]But now it exists in front of a green screen.
[172:50.59]So you can do things like this.
[173:12.12]We're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get rich.
[173:48.62]Whatever, a horn.
[173:49.48]Some kind of horn.
[173:51.10]She's a stupid streamer.
[173:54.02]Jbumbum7... How did you get that name?
[173:58.28]I can't believe that's the real Jbumbum that just said that.
[174:03.06]But yeah, now people can do shit like that.
[174:07.62]This one is called... Psycho Streamer Destroys Cybertruck.
[174:17.73]Yeah.
[174:20.82]Sure?
[174:21.58]Yeah.
[174:26.16]Well, maybe that was a little too hard.
[174:29.08]Should we try on the floor?
[174:38.79]It didn't go through, so that's a plus side.
[174:45.79]Well Maybe that was a little too hard
[175:14.47]It didn't go through, so that's a plus side.
[175:16.89]It's beauty, isn't she?
[175:20.97]It didn't go through.
[175:21.71]Fucking idiot.
[175:43.23]This might be one of my new favorite videos.
[175:44.85]It's just so stupid.
[175:53.09]You find the perfect places to put these stupid things.
[175:58.15]Is it better than the baseball video?
[175:59.61]No.
[176:00.23]Nothing ever will be.
[176:02.31]But that still fucking slayed me.
[176:05.29]That was so fucking stupid.
[176:06.35]I love it.
[176:09.34]This one is called Fireman's First Christmas.
[176:12.32]If you remember, I believe this is the same animator from last time.
[176:19.45]Here we go.
[176:42.85]nobody's saying he swears there's a five-year-old that's gonna watch this
[177:17.52]That's a little too hard for me.
[177:40.56]Nowhere is safe.
[177:41.66]It's Snowman!
[177:50.39]Their first meeting!
[178:13.26]That's not very funny, snowman.
[178:14.72]They're going to keep... It's a never-ending conflict.
[178:33.85]The unstoppable object versus the immovable firepower.
[178:38.15]Whatever it is.
[178:38.69]Huh?
[178:55.27]Why am I outside?
[178:56.37]What am I doing out here?
[179:08.28]Look, they're friends.
[179:09.40]They found a way.
[179:10.14]Uh-oh.
[179:26.29]Do I get out of here?
[179:30.37]Oh no!
[179:30.96]Help me!
[179:57.23]We don't- we don't have a bed?
[180:05.94]Look, it's Otto!
[180:07.68]Otto is sleep- What?
[180:10.74]I'm sleeping.
[180:21.99]Fireman's first person.
[180:24.25]That was very, very good.
[180:33.31]That was so cute.
[180:35.87]Cast.
[180:37.47]Jeremy Elbertson as me.
[180:39.21]Fireman as Fireman.
[180:40.61]Look at this dude.
[180:42.11]Snowman as Snowman.
[180:43.47]And Sleeping Dog as Otto.
[180:54.66]What is going on there?
[180:56.76]That's not even my face.
[181:00.80]Right?
[181:01.00]That is not my face.
[181:06.43]It's not.
[181:08.65]No, it is not.
[181:09.19]That's not my face.
[181:13.13]That's somebody else's face on my body or something.
[181:15.55]That's not my face.
[181:17.61]It's not real.
[181:18.15]I know it's not real because I know what my face looks like.
[181:23.08]That was fantastic.
[181:26.23]We're a little late.
[181:27.51]Christmas was a little while ago, but Kitchy Cat, that was, again, fantastic.
[181:34.34]Very, very, very well made.
[181:35.68]Very cute.
[181:36.18]Thank you.
[181:39.80]We all love it.
[181:42.96]Coming up next, this is called Jerma at the Carnival.
[181:48.22]Okay.
[181:53.08]Do we have audio on this thing?
[181:54.32]Oh, that was loud.
[181:57.16]Try it again.
[181:57.98]Do we have audio on this thing?
[181:59.26]Let's find out.
[181:59.84]Does it have audio?
[182:04.19]Can you hear it?
[182:20.92]I have no reaction to what just happened.
[182:22.98]I was initially going to start laughing, but then I was just like, I have no reaction to this.
[182:27.60]It was just too much.
[182:43.81]Okay, the fact that it stops when I turn around and it tails off
[182:52.70]killing me.
[182:58.92]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[183:01.28]What else we got?
[183:01.84]This is called Jerma Loses His Sanity.
[183:07.13]Here we go.
[183:09.07]Though your heart is aching, smile.
[183:12.17]Even though it's breaking.
[183:17.49]When there are clouds in the sky.
[183:22.78]Oh...
[183:44.64]I can't.
[183:46.76]I'm like broken right now.
[183:48.06]This is crazy.
[183:56.25]I'm confused.
[183:57.89]Alright, that was called Deterra's Insane or whatever it was.
[184:03.01]Have we seen this one before?
[184:03.99]I think we may have seen this.
[184:04.79]It's definitely worth showing again.
[184:07.46]It's another Star Wars one.
[184:08.78]Don't sue me.
[184:19.24]Oscar?
[184:21.42]Oh, I get the Oscar.
[184:51.88]Another Star Wars one incoming.
[184:54.90]I hope you guys have seen the movie Star Wars franchise.
[184:58.65]Do we have audio on this thing?
[185:10.13]Let's find out.
[185:23.51]That was a good clip.
[185:24.90]I like that one a lot.
[185:27.14]That was very good.
[185:27.82]That was really good.
[185:28.66]I like that one.
[185:29.46]Nice work.
[185:30.72]Any more Star Wars?
[185:36.12]Now, this is a Jerma's house tour.
[185:38.34]And already from the first frame here, this is accurate.
[185:41.26]This is very scary how accurate this is.
[185:45.81]I like this.
[185:46.25]They say, I hope you like it.
[185:47.45]By the way, there is no Jerma is small joke here.
[185:50.77]The doors are big because I can't do proportions.
[185:53.17]The bed is a reference to a stream.
[185:59.87]Let's find out.
[186:03.39]By the way, there's no short joke here.
[186:10.27]This looks exactly like the room.
[186:15.06]The music, too!
[186:19.35]How'd you get the music in here?
[186:32.60]Back to Kim, yeah.
[186:35.56]Let's see.
[186:35.94]Let's see how accurate this is.
[186:40.15]It's 100% accurate.
[186:41.11]It's my green screen room.
[186:50.71]What else?
[186:50.95]Where else are we going?
[186:53.81]Hang a right, and this brings us to... Bedroom.
[187:04.14]Okay.
[187:05.32]Hold on a minute.
[187:06.50]Pause the video.
[187:09.18]This is like, kind of, this is a joke.
[187:11.68]But, how awesome would this be?
[187:18.69]This would be incredible.
[187:28.17]It's a normal bed.
[187:29.87]No it's not, look at the door.
[187:37.43]This is actually really well made.
[187:39.25]I'm playing with the rats when I jump.
[187:42.33]Is there another room?
[187:43.93]There's the toilet.
[187:58.39]Am I going to piss?
[187:58.91]I'm going to have to close it if I piss.
[188:04.97]I would like that.
[188:06.21]I would like that.
[188:06.79]I really would.
[188:07.19]That painting.
[188:08.84]The paint job.
[188:15.96]I want a weird-ass room.
[188:17.08]You know what I mean?
[188:20.52]Eventually, I just want to have some strange-ass rooms that have wild paints on them and be fun.
[188:30.72]That was really well made.
[188:31.72]Nice job.
[188:36.54]This one says there's a secret dog ending is what this one's called.
[188:41.52]Secret dog ending.
[188:49.31]Let's see what it is.
[188:50.03]There you go.
[188:57.65]Autospotted.
[189:00.41]Bad dog.
[189:05.11]Bad dog.
[189:06.19]Hi everybody, my name is Adria.
[189:07.91]This is my video.
[189:09.27]I made this all by myself.
[189:11.99]This is how I attack my friend.
[189:13.57]This is very... I like... The...
[189:30.79]I want to see it again.
[189:31.37]I'd love to like, hi everybody, this is Adjo, and he's like sad.
[189:34.76]Alright, let's watch.
[189:35.32]There you go.
[189:40.08]Autospotted.
[189:42.86]Bad dog.
[189:47.56]Bad dog.
[189:48.62]Hi everybody, my name is Adjo.
[189:50.36]This is my video.
[189:51.72]I made this all by myself.
[189:53.17]This is how I attack my friend.
[189:56.03]Ah!
[190:02.97]That was... That was ridiculous.
[190:08.09]This is how I attack my... That was a Garfield scream?
[190:11.84]Holy shit, that was a Garfield scream.
[190:15.54]No, no, no, no, that's Tom from Tom and Jerry.
[190:18.32]Right, right, not Garfield.
[190:19.42]Garfield didn't scream!
[190:21.46]Since when does Garfield scream?
[190:22.89]Okay.
[190:23.71]This one's called Shut the Fuck Up, I'm Listening to Bratz Birthday Mixtape.
[190:55.86]Oh, there it is.
[190:56.62]There's, like, the guy... I lick my mouth every 15 seconds.
[191:03.53]Oh, I need lip balm.
[191:04.33]I got these dry-ass lips.
[191:11.15]Is this, uh... I've been shown this before, but I don't think I've ever shown this on stream.
[191:16.57]It's called, I can't even save in this game anymore.
[191:22.42]I don't really know the context of this, but...
[191:41.87]And he tries to fight him and then alright like what's one of these auto automatic fucking videos
[191:56.90]Must watch.
[191:59.12]Yeah, I ain't watching shit.
[192:01.58]So what's that reference to?
[192:04.10]What's that I can't save in this game anymore?
[192:06.14]Is that like a CS:GO gun game or something?
[192:12.41]I'm not gonna watch that.
[192:13.23]I don't wanna watch that.
[192:13.77]We got like 15 more videos.
[192:19.61]It's a famous bunny hopping video.
[192:23.43]Oh.
[192:26.15]And CS:GO, you can save your items at the end of the round.
[192:29.41]Oh.
[192:30.63]It's a currency thing.
[192:32.61]Ah, I see.
[192:33.41]I see.
[192:36.05]By the way, that video has 300,000 views.
[192:48.36]Alright, this one's called Parks and Recreation, but it's Jerma.
[192:53.22]Parks and Recreation, but apparently it's me.
[192:56.18]No, me.
[192:59.46]Careful.
[193:18.33]People are still ending these videos with the Earth exploding from Rat Movie.
[193:23.51]But I think I've said this before, that's the easiest way to end a video.
[193:45.88]It's so simple.
[193:47.56]If you're just like, how the fuck do I end this video?
[193:50.36]Easy.
[193:50.84]Just have the Earth explode.
[193:52.90]There's... That's why I did it.
[193:58.60]It was just... I don't know how to end this.
[194:00.74]I don't want to do that much more work.
[194:02.60]So let's... The Earth explodes.
[194:04.46]Okay.
[194:06.10]Reading a book.
[194:06.62]Yes.
[194:07.08]That's another way to end.
[194:08.62]It's just ways to make it so you don't have to do any more work.
[194:14.03]I think this, if this is what I think it is, I'm shocked and kind of, I can't believe it.
[194:23.10]I played Fear.
[194:26.38]I played Fear a couple months ago.
[194:29.88]And one of the things that I was doing was going around, because just ADHD, like, I just couldn't help it.
[194:35.35]I was breaking fire extinguishers.
[194:38.99]And I think I mentioned...
[194:43.58]To clip every time I hit a fire extinguisher.
[194:48.24]I think somebody did it.
[194:49.06]Thermosphere of fire extinguishers.
[194:58.87]I don't know about this one.
[195:03.75]Can I use this?
[195:04.81]Does it explode?
[195:06.62]Yep.
[195:10.48]Alright, here we go.
[195:16.11]This is gonna give me a headache.
[195:31.04]I don't know.
[195:33.30]For some reason, I thought I had to use that.
[195:37.46]How is it already broken?
[195:38.58]Impossible.
[195:39.72]What?
[195:40.99]Oh, this is where I came from.
[195:42.25]Right.
[195:42.53]Thank God.
[195:43.59]You guys wonder why I'm doing that.
[195:46.17]Why does he keep breaking those?
[195:48.59]Well, because it's a breadcrumb trail, and I know where I've been.
[195:53.81]The hell is... There's nothing in there.
[196:00.26]There's nothing in there.
[196:00.88]What are you doing?
[196:02.00]Uh-oh, I can't... Do I have him in a full retreat?
[196:05.60]Please, no!
[196:11.33]Alright.
[196:12.35]Guys, when Dwayne the Rock Johnson is standing there and he's like flexing in a mirror, just like looking huge and fucking awesome.
[196:20.30]And somebody comes up behind him and like grabs him.
[196:22.88]He's going to go.
[196:27.34]You can't.
[196:27.82]Nobody looks cool that way.
[196:29.92]It's true.
[196:44.37]Oh, here it is!
[196:44.87]I haven't- Okay, this is the electric- That's the electric- Ohhhh no.
[196:58.88]I love this game.
[197:01.01]And stay down.
[197:02.07]I cannot fucking believe you did this.
[197:10.35]I feel so much more at home.
[197:11.70]Computers.
[197:13.53]I can't believe you- I just want to shut out his computer so he freaks out.
[197:19.36]You know he's had that monitor for like 15 years.
[197:22.72]Fun thing.
[197:23.36]It's a really cool thing.
[197:30.37]Why am I in different clothes?
[197:35.93]Oh, it's a different day!
[197:36.97]I did that over two days.
[197:39.64]Alright, I haven't been in here yet.
[197:41.66]Right?
[197:43.08]Why did I not break that?
[197:44.22]I should have fucking known.
[197:46.72]Really?
[197:46.98]That's the point.
[197:49.78]That's why I'm doing this.
[197:51.42]See?
[197:51.62]Because I know that I was there.
[197:55.38]Missed lore.
[197:56.08]Missed lore.
[198:00.14]Don't skip lore.
[198:01.10]Don't skip lore.
[198:02.22]Don't skip lore.
[198:03.46]Don't skip lore.
[198:05.10]Almost two more minutes of this.
[198:09.40]This guy's doing a really great job of doing the random voice lines that play when you spawn for the first time in a League of Legends game as a champion.
[198:22.82]Fucked up medical stuff.
[198:26.00]You should have seen what the guy did.
[198:27.74]He flew up.
[198:29.48]The guy was going this way and then he got magnetized his face to the wall and blood splattered.
[198:34.85]He's going to be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[198:38.99]I'm lost.
[198:41.05]I'm so lost.
[198:41.99]I don't know what any of this means.
[198:43.06]I thought this was like a Google satellite image of a warehouse and roads and stuff.
[198:46.86]I was like, where is that?
[198:52.52]Holy shit.
[198:53.46]How many times did I actually do this?
[198:54.94]It's just available for me, so I do it.
[198:59.31]It's just a thing that I know.
[199:01.97]You know what I mean?
[199:03.35]It's routine.
[199:05.58]In a game with scary jump scares and all kinds of weird fucked up enemies, this is routine for me.
[199:11.45]It's comfortable.
[199:17.97]I can't believe I used to do that shit.
[199:21.11]Embarrassing.
[199:27.41]I remember when I thought that was fun.
[199:33.45]Memories.
[199:36.07]It's like looking at a whole photo.
[199:48.27]Should I just give this to the doctor?
[199:52.37]You know?
[199:52.61]I feel like this is just... This should be in the folder of stuff I bring.
[200:06.33]Dude, dude.
[200:07.89]I mean, seriously, that was, I can't believe you did it.
[200:10.93]That's, you had to go through, like, what, 17, 16 hours of stuff to find it?
[200:22.42]God damn.
[200:24.14]Well, we got it.
[200:28.51]This is Pokémon Gold Silver Crystal Battle, the Giant Enemy Spider.
[200:34.64]This actually is a music file, but there is some video to go with it.
[200:38.80]I bet you could never guess what it is.
[200:43.33]See, a lot of people didn't know that there was a boss battle in this.
[200:48.65]The Giant Enemy Spider...
[201:10.20]Remember when I did all this?
[201:40.03]feels bad man old youtube yeah you know memories you know when you like look at that old photograph
[201:59.37]How long can you keep it up for?
[202:01.29]How long can you do it for?
[202:02.91]It's like passing an old fire extinguisher.
[202:31.56]This is where it's from.
[202:37.04]I've never played this game.
[202:42.98]Why would I have that in my head for any reason?
[202:44.86]Probably Smash Bros.
[202:46.01]Yeah, definitely Smash Bros.
[202:49.01]This is where they got the Pokémon song.
[203:00.23]This is where they got that Pokémon song, you know?
[203:03.75]That's fucking awesome.
[203:14.32]This is a remix?
[203:16.70]Well, I mean, I know, I mean, of course it's a remix.
[203:21.24]It's really good, though.
[203:24.02]Very, very fucking great job.
[203:26.91]Giant enemy spider.
[203:29.47]Is this a remake?
[203:30.09]Yeah, what do you... How's this?
[203:33.67]More music here.
[203:34.39]This is, well, technically, kind of.
[203:36.91]This is Sea Shanty 2, but it's Jerma's Pirate Marching Band.
[203:46.30]Hi, Squash.
[203:48.48]Oh, hi!
[203:51.62]What are you playing at?
[203:54.96]What are you playing as?
[203:56.68]I'm gonna be playing Team Fortress 2 as...
[204:29.02]I never played RuneScape before.
[204:30.34]I know a lot of people love it.
[204:34.13]I never played it.
[204:37.11]That was, uh... I think I don't know what... Hold on, let's go over here for a second.
[204:42.33]I mean, I know this part.
[204:45.77]But what happens here?
[204:49.10]What's going on in this image here?
[204:53.14]Is this character not supposed to be here?
[204:54.58]I just got killed by a dwarf.
[205:01.62]Alright, can someone explain RuneScape to me in a small, like, three words?
[205:07.16]Is it hard?
[205:07.90]When you die, are you dead?
[205:11.43]It's RuneScape.
[205:12.59]You see, like, people die in RuneScape.
[205:15.63]And it's a huge problem or something.
[205:20.21]You lose all your items when you die.
[205:22.05]Okay.
[205:26.95]Stream RuneScape.
[205:28.17]I don't know if I want to do that.
[205:31.58]You just literally respawn.
[205:33.22]Oh.
[205:36.82]Well, I always thought it was something... It was hardcore or something.
[205:44.32]No, I don't have any... I can't get into, like, another MMO.
[205:47.64]No way.
[205:50.24]You respawn, but without... So it's like Minecraft.
[205:54.62]Okay, I get it.
[206:00.75]Coming up next is a one-second video.
[206:04.29]I don't even know how you get a one-second video.
[206:05.83]You can upload it to YouTube, but here it is.
[206:07.24]Jerma eats a Lunchable.
[206:14.48]It's good.
[206:18.74]Jerma get mad, then do stunt.
[206:26.28]You got something to say?
[206:27.61]Yes, I do.
[206:38.97]What on Earth just happened?
[206:41.71]You got something to say?
[206:43.05]Yes, I do.
[206:43.77]What?
[206:54.23]Jerma, get mad then do stunt.
[206:55.97]I guess it is just the title, huh?
[207:00.64]Regular show.
[207:02.86]Changed clothes mid-throw.
[207:06.64]Oh man, I fucking love these.
[207:11.53]This is a new Bill Crazy video.
[207:13.61]Another Bill Crazy interpretation of footage.
[207:18.97]Hey, what's going on, Crazy Fios?
[207:20.71]It's me, Crazy Bill Crazy!
[207:23.31]Yeah!
[207:23.77]I'm here with another video, here with always, Gary the Fuck-Up!
[207:27.13]It's me, Gary the Fuck-Up!
[207:28.44]And today, as you see, I'm sitting in a pool of water!
[207:32.66]Water!
[207:33.02]And with water in it!
[207:34.18]That's right, motherfucker!
[207:35.62]And what's gonna happen here today...
[207:37.56]Gary is gonna drop a toaster in here.
[207:40.32]I'm gonna see how long I can last.
[207:42.44]It's gonna hurt like a bitch, you know what I mean?
[207:45.84]Can't wait.
[207:47.08]Yeah, Gary, I'm ready.
[207:49.06]Throw it in there.
[207:50.50]Make sure you like this video.
[207:53.08]Wow, that was... That was crazy.
[208:09.56]I love all the Gary the Fuck-Up videos and Bill Crazy videos because they're all a little different somehow.
[208:16.79]Sometimes it's a pool.
[208:17.83]Sometimes it's a beach.
[208:19.83]Sometimes it's a bathtub.
[208:21.57]They're always just slightly different to a point where I like watching them.
[208:33.75]I can't just let a video get to the end because I have ADD and I have to get it right before it ends.
[208:40.55]I piss off so many of my friends if I watch videos and stuff.
[208:42.97]I'm just like, oh, it's done.
[208:43.75]I'm done.
[208:44.43]I gotta click it too.
[208:45.89]I know a lot of people do that shit.
[208:47.69]I'm one of them.
[208:49.73]It's called Jerma Boulder.
[208:51.15]We'd best leave till the weather's better.
[208:52.81]The rain loosens some of this rock.
[208:56.48]I think it's Boulder wanting us to go away.
[209:08.36]What?
[209:18.37]I missed that somehow.
[209:29.55]Is that supposed to be from the AI dungeon stream?
[209:33.87]Here is Mad Tyrant Jerma kills his child subjects.
[209:42.32]everyone's been a baby so wait does that mean that I've been killing babies I killed them all is that what that means and not just the men
[210:08.80]Oh shit, I've been killing actual babies this whole time.
[210:15.54]I remember we saw this one.
[210:18.44]My favorite part is the... That was a good one.
[210:37.33]Oh, here's another, and we have made it to the mostly music.
[210:40.91]Well, there's a couple more videos.
[210:42.80]Jeremy made another giant spider joke.
[210:44.80]Oh, boy.
[210:45.60]Oh, boy.
[210:47.16]Oh, boy.
[211:07.46]Ha ha ha!
[211:55.89]Quick, somebody make a remix of this remix.
[212:04.09]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[212:06.51]This is not what I wanted.
[212:07.15]Go back.
[212:07.41]How do I go back?
[212:08.80]Is that just a four-second video?
[212:10.34]Two years alone in the world?
[212:12.36]Why did that end?
[212:13.10]No, no, no!
[212:17.78]No, I... I'm lost by... Okay, somebody said that Sour Place is a shitty emote.
[212:25.68]That's why I paused.
[212:26.72]Somebody said, dude, Sour Place really, like, sucks.
[212:29.33]Somebody said that, and I was like, oh, it does?
[212:31.27]And then I freaked out and I pressed the wrong button.
[212:35.47]I don't know I don't I don't have an opinion of it I think it's cool I guess it doesn't I know it's cool it's cool back to backtracking Barry coming up up coming up on you this one's called uh giant enemy firebrand giant enemy firebrand more enemy spider memes because they this has come back hard over the last month or two the giant enemy
[213:07.42]I don't get it.
[213:08.26]I don't get it, but... What is Firebrand?
[213:10.46]Is that a... Is it the enemy in the game or something?
[213:37.88]We need you to do a ghost and goblin stream.
[213:43.64]Play super ghosts and ghouls and ghosts.
[213:49.96]Ghosts and goblins is so hard.
[213:51.30]Alright, I'll do it.
[213:58.11]I can't tell you I'm going to beat it, but I'll do it.
[214:04.25]That is the end of the videos for this one.
[214:08.09]Next week, we're going to do more.
[214:11.59]But I wanted to break it up a little bit so it wasn't ridiculous too much.
[214:15.75]I wanted to give some time.
[214:17.63]And that's right.
[214:19.26]We've got another one to watch.
[214:21.50]There is another one to watch.
[214:22.82]Here it comes.
[214:34.48]And we're going to watch this probably three times.
[215:10.28]Oh, walk off.
[215:17.51]Oh.
[215:19.77]You didn't think I was going to catch it.
[215:21.01]And then the brawl.
[215:23.05]Also, just the small nuanced way.
[215:25.69]The shushing somebody back here.
[215:28.37]I love it.
[215:28.99]It's perfect.
[215:29.43]He's hitting 10 straight.
[215:35.61]And he hits it right back at Jose.
[215:37.73]It's my birthday today.
[215:39.13]Of course it's New York.
[216:03.76]Imagine, I've said it before, every time we watch this video, I always bring it up, but like imagine Tomahawk in a fucking home run.
[216:12.07]Uh oh.
[216:15.29]Hold on, there's another one.
[216:16.97]I wanted so badly, and here's the thing about the baseball shit from the green screen, I wanted people so badly to put me in sports videos and shit, and not very many people did.
[216:30.02]But the one, like, I wanted these so bad.
[216:36.79]Here.
[216:38.47]Here's another one.
[216:55.67]I just love... It's just so stupid.
[217:04.45]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[217:06.99]We have a little bit more to do, and by a little bit more to do, I mean we have some music to listen to.
[217:10.90]Uh, tongue.
[217:16.88]This is a freeze frame.
[217:20.03]We have some more music to listen to.
[217:21.03]We have, uh, this one here.
[217:24.03]This is called, uh, Giant Enemy Spider.
[217:30.00]Another one.
[217:30.30]This is called Jerma Spider's Final Boss.
[217:34.40]Let's just hang out in a dark room and listen to this music.
[217:38.40]The giant enemy spider.
[218:21.58]Is that what this is?
[218:23.38]Is that what this is called?
[218:28.62]Crazy into you, crazy into you.
[218:31.96]Oh, don't even remind me of that.
[218:35.00]Fo sho, fo sho.
[218:54.42]Worst noise of 2020?
[218:55.04]Why?
[218:55.12]Oh yeah.
[219:34.11]This one's called Rats.
[219:36.85]Rats.
[219:37.27]I forgot.
[219:37.81]Yes, I did.
[219:39.43]Now I remember it in real time.
[219:45.34]It's still itchy and I flushed it with water.
[219:48.80]It's called Rats, Rats, Rats.
[220:08.67]Daft Punk did the Daft Punk is a true fan?
[220:11.61]Yeah.
[221:24.14]is that true oh you go big guy is that true whoa you go big guy I did it for you now nobody has to do anything that's called rats rats rats we've got two more songs next one coming up is called guess who likes you
[221:53.89]And this actually says, wait for it.
[221:58.01]So wait for it is what this says.
[222:02.11]Okay.
[222:03.59]Say bye to the VOD.
[222:26.19]Wait for it.
[222:27.13]Is this just a song?
[222:30.63]Did they make this?
[222:46.87]Why does this work?
[222:47.39]I don't know.
[222:48.49]It's Doug.
[222:48.93]Year of the rat.
[222:50.49]Incoming, yep.
[223:19.03]Celebrate another on a birthday bath And the final song of the evening it's called rap lord spider There was a boss battle of this the giant enemy spider
[224:00.04]Turn this shit up.
[224:01.12]I did, I did turn it up.
[224:02.48]It's loud as fuck.
[224:03.70]Turn this shit up.
[224:05.39]Turn this shit off.
[224:32.38]I pissed all over the toilet.
[224:33.84]I had to clean it up.
[224:34.92]It was bad.
[224:37.00]It was out of control.
[224:38.98]It wouldn't stop.
[224:43.15]Let's bring that to the doctor too.
[224:44.87]That probably shouldn't be happening either.
[224:45.99]Alright.
[224:52.71]That is the end of the community content stream.
[224:59.17]We have a literal leak.
[225:02.53]Part 1, I should say.
[225:03.79]Part 1.
[225:04.25]Community Content Night Part 2 will be next weekend.
[225:08.47]And then next weekend we will be caught up completely to the last 30 days or so.
[225:15.10]We'll be caught up completely on Saturday of next week.
[225:20.08]Replay the best video of the night.
[225:24.14]I mean, it's not a contest.
[225:27.30]It's not supposed to be a contest.
[225:30.06]Not at all.
[225:31.74]this is never supposed to be a contest to the whiskey a couple of doubles last night he's hitting 10 straight and he hits it right back at Jose at the bottom of a pile and both teams storming for them
[226:15.65]You're a boomer.
[226:16.47]It's a baseball.
[226:19.54]It's not a big deal.
[226:22.52]At all.
[226:23.68]At it.
[226:25.98]In the same place.
[226:29.18]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[226:32.00]That's it for tonight.
[226:32.86]Short stream today.
[226:33.67]I will be back on Tuesday.
[226:41.51]Joel and I are going to do Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes again.
[226:48.10]And this is going to be, we're going to switch off this time back and forth.
[226:51.22]So there's going to be a keep talking, nobody explodes stream on Tuesday.
[226:55.72]And then what we'll probably end up doing is we're going to do Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday of this coming week.
[227:01.06]We've got a lot of other stuff to play.
[227:04.61]We're essentially just going to go and tick stuff off the list.
[227:15.21]When is the green screen?
[227:17.60]After I get a shot of nerve blocking steroids into my ribs.
[227:25.65]And I don't have a time frame for that yet.
[227:27.40]Because that's... That's apparently what I'm going to have to do.
[227:38.03]So, if you missed, if you don't know what I'm talking about, I was going to go back in front of the green screen, because obviously... Oh, let me just change the scenes here, because this is the end.
[227:48.10]I was going to go back in front of the green screen and do six more hours of green screen content, right?
[227:54.85]Just because this shit is so funny.
[227:58.61]You guys come up with so much stuff, and even still, a full year later...
[228:06.43]These clips are still used and still put in funny places that you guys have just had.
[228:11.97]It never stops.
[228:14.01]So I wanted to give way more footage for you guys to use.
[228:20.28]But I've come down with a strange medical condition, where my core, kind of around my, all in the middle of my ribs, in the back, in my spine and back and ribs and shit, hurts.
[228:32.61]And my range of motion is limited.
[228:34.43]I mean, I can still move around.
[228:36.33]I'm fine.
[228:37.01]But I can't, like, throw my arms around and fucking run around and jump and land.
[228:42.18]My range of motion is smaller.
[228:43.80]It's tighter now.
[228:45.78]And we're still trying to figure out exactly what's going on.
[228:49.46]But they think that I have to get... They think I have costochondritis.
[228:52.46]I mean, I have a hernia, which I've said before.
[228:55.59]But I might also have costochondritis, which is inflammation in your rib cage.
[228:59.27]And this really, you don't do anything to treat it.
[229:01.27]There is no treatment.
[229:02.01]It's just do a thing that makes your body not hurt anymore, which is steroids.
[229:06.11]Like an injection in your ribs.
[229:08.86]But I will cross that bridge when I have to.
[229:17.94]But I'm good.
[229:19.16]It's not like every day I can't walk or anything.
[229:21.94]I'm fine completely.
[229:23.68]But turning my body more than probably 30 or 40 degrees to the left or right.
[229:28.25]Ah, it hurts.
[229:33.81]But that's the reason why I haven't done it yet.
[229:36.15]I'm waiting on to get all that.
[229:37.19]2020 is the year where I want to get truly back to health.
[229:40.20]Because I have been... It's not that I have been eating unhealthy or being unhealthy.
[229:46.60]My body has decided to, at this stage, the last year and a half or so, is to sort of revolt.
[229:54.05]So 2020, I really want to get healthy again.
[229:58.13]Whether that's, you know, find treatment for the back and rib problems.
[230:02.88]I want to get back into being healthy.
[230:05.46]And not necessarily, oh, I'm going to go to the gym every day, but just not kind of feel like dumpy two or three days a week.
[230:11.73]You know what I mean?
[230:14.07]If that makes any sense.
[230:15.99]But let's do the bits.
[230:19.57]Thanks for watching.
[230:20.21]Again, the community content nights are always really, really fun for me.
[230:22.71]Because we get to watch and enjoy all the funny things that everybody makes and all the great artwork that you guys do.
[230:33.48]A lot of talented, funny people here.
[230:35.48]And I love showcasing it.
[230:37.84]And each one of these is the third time we've done this.
[230:40.36]Well, technically fifth time we've done this.
[230:44.04]Where my face hurts from laughing at at least five to ten of these.
[230:47.50]You know what I mean?
[230:52.77]No.
[230:53.67]Drink water.
[230:54.33]I drink a lot of water.
[230:55.97]Don't worry.
[230:56.29]It's not the water.
[230:58.33]But hey, let's go back.
[230:59.15]Finny gave 250 quick, guys.
[231:01.33]Do a hype train.
[231:04.22]The hype train did happen.
[231:05.66]I have increased the difficulty on it.
[231:07.22]And if I'm going to bring it up to its maximum, we'll see what happens after that.
[231:12.16]But I appreciate it nonetheless.
[231:14.87]Ocean dweller, thanks for 250.
[231:16.05]Jeremy, you made it harder, but people still gonna do it.
[231:19.14]We're just spending more money now.
[231:20.74]The smart move is to make it super easy so people don't waste as much and it's over faster.
[231:28.06]Just make it like $5 so we get to level 5 instantly.
[231:34.96]Something about that is funny, but I feel like it would be annoying after a couple days.
[231:42.16]I'll try it.
[231:42.70]I'll try that next stream.
[231:46.76]Yeah, I'll make it, like, five bucks.
[231:48.98]Until I get to level five or something.
[231:53.15]Or I might just turn it off.
[231:53.91]You know, it doesn't have to be there.
[232:06.49]I'm back on soy and McDonald's and fast food.
[232:10.17]I don't really like soy.
[232:12.97]I don't like soy milk.
[232:13.85]I don't really eat soy products.
[232:16.27]I'm not a big soy fan.
[232:19.47]I don't really take that much dairy besides a little cheese every now and then.
[232:23.19]And some yogurt.
[232:25.15]But I drink almond milk.
[232:28.19]I have replaced almond milk 100% with everything else.
[232:31.33]That is dairy.
[232:36.72]Wait, you're a chat if you drink almond milk?
[232:39.31]Is that how it works?
[232:43.93]Oh.
[232:46.29]Shoutout to the 4,000 doctors in the chat.
[232:48.68]Yeah, shoutout to all these doctors.
[232:54.24]Uh...
[232:57.73]But yeah, Potion Dweller, I'll probably just get rid of it.
[233:00.77]It's a fun thing to do.
[233:01.74]Maybe I'll turn it on every once in a while.
[233:03.76]But I'm probably not going to have it on every day.
[233:06.26]It's been around for about a week.
[233:08.52]I'll probably, I'll turn on like the hype train like once every few weeks or something maybe if people really want to do that.
[233:14.06]Not every day.
[233:18.91]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[233:20.25]Jeremy, today I was thinking you remind me of Courage the Cowardly Dog.
[233:22.79]His laugh.

[235:32.68]Jerma, have you ever had a... They say... It's a certain couple words in a row.
[235:39.71]And then they say, whether or not you have, I'm just glad I was able to make you say this out loud.
[235:45.07]Well, you didn't.
[235:50.31]I don't even know.
[235:50.89]I'm going to say no.
[235:52.97]I'm going to say no.

[236:06.48]Appreciate it, ya boi.
[236:12.84]We also had 250 from Zake.
[236:16.24]Here's the money.
[236:16.74]Can I please have my hamster back?
[236:18.10]I miss him so much.
[236:18.92]He was my only friend.
[236:22.94]Some of you guys give bits every stream, talking about how, like, I'm going to hurt you.
[236:28.00]I'm not... Thanks for the $2.50.
[236:34.54]Beaker.
[236:35.00]Thank you, Beaker, for the $5.
[236:36.28]Hey, Jermbo.
[236:37.48]Do you know what the record is for your longest stream ever?
[236:40.56]Have you ever legitimately thought of doing a 24-hour stream?
[236:43.72]And in love from the frigid wasteland of northern Minnesota.
[236:48.10]The longest stream ever was 13 hours, and it was five days ago.
[236:54.33]It was the Lord of the Rings, the two towers.
[236:56.01]It was 13 hours and 20 minutes or something.
[236:59.41]That's an easy question because it just happened.
[237:03.42]I've never thought of doing a 24 hour stream because it's very unhealthy.
[237:07.08]It's not good.
[237:09.50]Unless you are switching off with people.
[237:13.09]For instance, if there was three or four people that were doing like a charity thing or.
[237:19.15]It's really just not healthy to sit in the same spot for 24 hours.
[237:23.81]Or more.
[237:24.47]It's just bad for you.
[237:25.59]I don't... I could... No.
[237:27.25]I was exhausted.
[237:30.79]I was physically beaten.
[237:33.69]After that 13 hour stream.
[237:36.13]That adding twice that?
[237:37.75]No way.
[237:38.39]That's just no fun.
[237:39.71]That's no fun.
[237:48.15]Would Twitch let you sleep on stream if it was pre-approved?
[237:52.37]No, probably not.
[237:53.45]But at that point, you're not even streaming.
[237:55.58]At that point, the clock is just ticking.
[237:57.84]Just so you can have a 24-hour stream.
[238:00.92]You know what I mean?
[238:01.36]It's like, oh yeah, I'm doing a 24-hour stream.
[238:04.46]Except I'm doing 13 and I'm going to just lie down in bed for 8 hours.
[238:13.20]No.
[238:13.46]It's unhealthy.
[238:14.60]I don't want to do it.
[238:18.96]The longest you'll ever see, truly, is something like 10 to 13, 10 to 14 max.
[238:29.71]You're not supposed to just sit down like that and just stare at a monitor for 15 hours.
[238:37.49]It's really just bad for you.
[238:45.67]Go get a standing desk.
[238:49.22]I don't think I'd want to stand for 15 or 14 hours.
[238:55.73]As humans, you've got to move around.
[238:57.35]If I was going to do a 24-hour stream, every two to three hours, I would take a 30-minute break.
[239:05.77]But then that's just not even... At some point, you're just doing it just to say you did it.
[239:11.42]Which, I don't really care.
[239:18.90]no no plans to ever do it dead regal thanks for the 250 I'm sick and tired of all the Bugleberry hate bugle boys across the nation are rising up and we're not taking it anymore I'm a Bugleberry fan fight for the screams of every man alright can we get some support here back in thanks for the 250 hey Jerma glad I could catch the stream after my 10-day stay at the hospital
[239:45.01]I missed you so much that I had dreams of you streaming just random games like Mario Odyssey and League of Legends.
[239:51.93]Anyways, keep doing you.
[239:55.84]I'm not sure exactly what you're doing in the hospital, but hopefully you're good to go.
[240:02.12]That is a wild dream to have, considering that I will never play League of Legends on this channel.
[240:10.06]I did make a League of Legends video.
[240:12.44]But it wasn't... It was Grandpa.
[240:14.06]It was me walking into towers.
[240:20.37]That was it.
[240:24.25]Yenwen, thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[240:26.97]$15 from Yenwen.
[240:28.13]Grandma, I know your face quite well.
[240:29.61]I can teach you how to draw.
[240:30.75]I'm certain of it.
[240:32.41]I'm unteachable.
[240:34.58]Nobody can teach me how to draw.
[240:35.67]I can't even hold a pencil right.
[240:36.59]I don't have the patience for it.
[240:39.15]I will draw six or seven lines and then be like, I'm done.
[240:43.35]I'm done.
[240:43.65]I can't.
[240:44.13]I gotta get up and scream.
[240:45.29]I can't do it.
[240:45.79]I can't do it.
[240:46.45]I have no patience.
[240:47.77]I have no patience with it.
[240:48.65]I can't sit there and do it.
[240:49.99]Nope.
[240:50.33]Not gonna happen.
[240:55.01]No, I can't do it.
[240:55.51]I can't do it.
[240:55.95]I can't do it.
[240:56.41]I can't do it.
[240:56.77]I can't do it.
[240:57.15]No, I can't.
[241:00.24]No, I can't do it.
[241:00.94]I can't do it.
[241:01.58]I can't do it.
[241:03.08]You have an art degree.
[241:05.56]No, I don't have an art degree.
[241:08.54]I have the, I didn't know what to pick for a minor in college.
[241:13.69]And art sounded like the most interesting.
[241:23.11]Liar.
[241:25.15]You tilt brush VR.
[241:26.39]I was gonna, I was on the list until I stopped doing VR.
[241:29.67]Again, once I get this bullshit under control, that's one of the plans to go back to VR too.
[241:37.55]But thank you, Yen-Wen.
[241:39.01]You are incredibly talented.
[241:41.29]Grandma, please hire me as your art tutor.
[241:43.99]I need a job, seriously.
[241:45.03]I can't do it.
[241:48.09]I've tried.
[241:48.83]I've had so many people try.
[241:50.35]I have had so many people attempt, and then I just, like, I don't have time for it anymore.
[242:01.72]But this is a great picture.
[242:02.66]Let's put it on.
[242:14.60]Don't listen to chat.
[242:15.34]You really can't do it.
[242:16.48]Hey, Granko.
[242:20.62]Hey, Granko's trying to be realistic with me.
[242:25.68]He learned pottery for a joke.
[242:28.67]Yeah, but that's different, though.
[242:30.69]Look at how hard this is to do.
[242:32.85]It takes a ton of time.
[242:33.97]I don't have time.
[242:35.73]I don't have time.
[242:38.39]This is a fantastic image, though, Yanwen.
[242:39.85]Seriously.
[242:41.72]Killing it like always.
[242:48.21]also had 500 bits from siku 500 subs curls you can't do curls anymore tell me Barry thanks for the 500 bits glad to catch the live stream for once glad to have you here thank you welcome uh upster narwhal thanks for the 300 bits
[243:09.51]Hey Jerma, I donated last night about the Jerma Auto emote, and I got a question for you.
[243:14.23]Why are emotes not allowed for Community Content Night?
[243:17.11]Is there an emote contest coming up soon?
[243:18.77]I have over 50 plus emotes on BTTV, and 100 total that I've made over the past few months.
[243:25.83]You have just described the reason why.
[243:29.77]That is the exact reason why.
[243:33.87]because there's a lot and if emotes there would be there would be an entire probably two to three hour section for emotes what has happened in the recent months is their Discord emotes I will probably not do an official community emote contest again for a while but what we've decided is open up emotes for Discord
[244:08.94]that's kind of the plan for that the Discord ones are cool like bits yeah there's like 100 emote slots yeah but you you gotta remember for me just because it exists doesn't mean I want to have them you know what I mean I want new emotes to be
[244:35.09]important and different and I just did oh well you got a hundred slots just upload a hundred emotes I want them to all have their own individual value and not just throw up like 30 or 40 new emotes just because I have them and I know that jermaTV exists but that was a community email
[244:57.94]You have a hundred slots?
[244:59.66]I haven't even looked.
[245:01.04]I don't know.
[245:01.92]I actually have no idea how many slots I have.
[245:03.90]And I don't want to look because I don't want to be embarrassed.
[245:10.28]Emotes to me are... Was this something so significant that we thought was interesting?
[245:17.73]That it needs to be a way to express as a picture.
[245:21.21]You know what I'm saying?
[245:24.13]Or just like randomly something funny that happens.
[245:26.09]I...
[245:28.46]And it needs to have the test of time, too.
[245:35.36]Yes, I could have 50 different emotes of the same image, but like a small change to my face.
[245:43.97]But I don't really want to do that.
[245:50.80]Discord emote slots.
[245:52.40]Oh.
[245:52.52]That would be funny, though.
[245:57.27]Through the planets, they're all very important to me.
[245:59.11]There's only like one or two that aren't done.
[246:07.28]5G Jerma and Jerma Psycho are the next ones.
[246:10.00]The test of time is there.
[246:12.84]There it is.
[246:15.35]We need to be sure.
[246:16.05]They can stand the test of time.
[246:17.79]We don't want another bald coin.
[246:28.64]It's the most requested, probably.
[246:30.84]But no, to answer your question, community content night, emotes would just take up so much time and so many people would just submit them.
[246:37.56]And then afterwards, it's like, alright, well, why don't you have to add those now?
[246:42.68]It's like, well, we just looked at 150 emotes.
[246:44.28]I'm just going to, I can't.
[246:50.52]He's inflating the stocks of BLD.
[246:52.45]Don't use it.
[247:06.58]by now but we'll see that look all these things are subject to change always because I'm gonna bump you here for a second because I don't know this as the channel gets larger and there's more and more people here there's more and more things that need to be tweaked and changed and this is not the channel it was two years ago
[247:26.91]It's a lot more people, a lot more stuff going on.
[247:29.65]You know what I'm saying?
[247:30.99]The streams might be very similar, but the channel has changed a little.
[247:35.03]Like, we brought on so many more people.
[247:42.95]This motherfucker's gone corporate.
[247:47.72]We have the same emotes from two years ago.
[247:49.64]Yeah, we also have ones from this year, like last year, too.
[247:56.72]Corporate influencer.
[248:01.32]It's all subject to change.
[248:03.50]It really is.
[248:05.64]E-clown.
[248:08.76]Thank you Magpie for the 500 bits.
[248:10.42]Apparently the 3D movie maker rat is named Febreze.
[248:13.78]The wiki also has Rocco from Rocco's Modern Life for whatever fucking reason.
[248:17.93]Well that's because there was a Nickelodeon 3D movie maker.
[248:21.53]Extension.
[248:22.53]Add on.
[248:23.43]There is a Nickelodeon 3D movie maker.
[248:26.62]It exists.
[248:28.54]It's the exact same game, but with Ren, Stimpy, Tommy Pickles, and Rocko and shit.
[248:39.87]You need to stream that.
[248:44.01]No Bugleberry emote.
[248:45.17]Well, I mean, the book's still out on Bugleberry.
[248:47.35]I'm still gauging that one.
[248:55.79]But yeah, they do have names.
[248:58.48]Another maple thanks for the 300 bits.
[248:59.66]I just say love you, Jeremy.
[249:02.04]Thank you.
[249:08.03]Gray the color, thanks for 300 bits.
[249:10.75]Jeremy, you look legitimately handsome whenever you smile and nod.
[249:13.25]Anyone calling you a smalding goblin is talking pure shit.
[249:17.12]You're, like, legitimately fucking good looking.
[249:19.60]Also, Moo Crew makes Drew Crew eat poo-poo.
[249:23.14]Yeah, I wouldn't say pissy shitty, but I would say Drew Crew eat poo-poo.
[249:28.15]So, that just shows how much of a fucking hypocrite I am.
[249:36.65]Thank you, though.
[249:37.37]Thank you, Tar Alacrin, for the $2.53.
[249:38.99]It's time to talk about your being an alcoholic.
[249:44.49]What are you talking about?
[249:47.94]This is a clip from earlier.
[249:49.00]What is it?
[249:51.14]What do you mean?
[249:51.84]I drink whatever I want to drink out of any cup that I can get.
[250:02.40]What's wrong with that?
[250:03.02]I drink whatever I want to drink out of any cup that I can get.
[250:09.81]What's wrong with that?
[250:11.29]If you have just... If you have like a coffee mug that's clean, and you want to drink a glass of wine, put it in the coffee mug.
[250:20.64]Who cares?
[250:26.82]Does it really matter?
[250:28.44]It's just a container that holds liquid.
[250:35.63]Nobody's seeing me do... I'm just... If I was sitting here having a glass of wine out of a coffee mug, none of you even would know I was doing that.
[250:47.50]Unless the facecam was on.
[250:52.56]So it's like, what?
[250:53.00]I need to show you my cool, elaborate $40 wine glass?
[251:01.73]No.
[251:02.17]And plus, I have the Ninja Turtles sippy cups.
[251:04.88]are a godsend, because I can drop them and be fine.
[251:07.18]You know what happens if you drop a glass of wine on the ground?
[251:14.62]It shatters, glass goes everywhere, and you ruin your floor forever.
[251:21.10]If you drop a sippy cup with wine in it on the ground, it bounces.
[251:27.12]Nothing happens, and you pick it up.
[251:32.10]Now explain to me which one is this crazy person.
[251:35.88]Explain to me who's the weirdo there.
[251:44.87]Ain't me.
[251:46.75]It ain't me.
[251:55.16]Tar Alacrin, thanks for the $2.52.
[251:56.60]I'm on top of your $2.53.
[251:59.02]Please don't waste your time watching a thousand hours of JoJo's Adventure.
[252:03.27]The only reason people like that nonsense is because they get Stockholm Syndrome through watching it for so long.
[252:10.49]Watch Ping Pong.
[252:11.93]It's literally the greatest show, animated or otherwise, to ever grace this Earth in its only 11 episodes.
[252:17.06]Trust me, I'm like a 100-month sub.
[252:29.87]He's right.
[252:30.75]He's right about it.
[252:31.57]He's right about ping pong.
[252:32.83]Actually true.
[252:34.99]What is ping pong?
[252:38.95]Ping pong is actually fucking great.
[252:42.72]Don't listen to that one guy.
[252:44.14]Why not?
[252:45.28]There's a lot of one guys in here right now.
[252:49.32]Sorry, what?
[252:50.20]Only 11 episodes?
[252:51.20]He's talking my language.
[252:52.38]Only 11 episodes?
[252:56.16]Are they 20, what, 22 minutes?
[253:03.54]Yes.
[253:04.66]Okay.
[253:13.36]Cool.
[253:15.02]How many episodes are in JoJo?
[253:16.18]500.
[253:16.20]500.
[253:16.22]500.
[253:23.04]Guys, I tap out
[253:34.80]I tap out at Extended Edition of Lord of the Rings.
[253:40.52]I gotta be able to watch the whole show in less than 20 to 30 hours.
[253:49.14]In like 25 hours for a whole show, like that's 22 minutes in length, 20 minutes per episode.
[253:53.30]It's not 500, that's a lie.
[253:53.94]It's like 80 episodes, not 500.
[253:56.95]Oh, well...
[254:05.13]It's not 25, you buffoon.
[254:08.05]Wait, why am I a buffoon?
[254:09.51]People are just lying to me.
[254:10.83]Hey, how many episodes?
[254:13.69]I'm asking, I asked a question.
[254:17.00]How many episodes are in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?
[254:19.34]500, 500, there are like 800, there are 500, 500.
[254:20.86]Oh, there are 500.
[254:21.32]What, are you an idiot?
[254:22.02]I asked a question.
[254:22.54]I asked a question.
[254:35.93]It's 152 surrounded by liars.
[254:40.59]I've taught you well.
[254:42.37]Surrounded by liars.
[254:45.06]Jerma, maybe there's a reason why they're doing that.
[254:47.78]You put forth the lies and then they think that they can lie too.
[254:51.64]No more lies.
[254:52.96]No more lying.
[254:55.38]We're turning over a new leaf.
[254:56.78]No more lying for you guys.
[254:59.29]Or for me.
[255:01.63]You're a dumbass for asking.
[255:02.89]And ban that person.
[255:04.54]No more making mean, rude comments either.
[255:07.28]Let's turn over a new leaf.
[255:08.18]Ban that person.
[255:20.63]Somebody said, fuck you, but I know they weren't saying it to me.
[255:24.09]They were saying that to somebody else because they know that if I saw that, I would get rid of them.
[255:30.01]I know you weren't saying it to me.
[255:31.10]Do one chance.
[255:33.64]Do one warning.
[255:35.47]You guys are just saying fuck you to each other.
[255:37.34]You have to be, because why would you ever do that?
[255:38.96]Because with the thought of potentially being an internet protocol banned from Twitch.
[255:44.54]Weird.
[255:45.20]You have to be talking to each other or something.
[255:46.68]It must have been an argument.
[255:53.55]Hey, Hank Cheesecake, thanks for the five community subs.
[256:05.99]Poor Monster gave the $50.
[256:07.07]You're my favorite influencer.
[256:08.83]Thanks.
[256:09.13]Yeah, I know.
[256:10.31]Mostly lost.
[256:10.91]Thanks for $250.
[256:11.45]I see short influencer streamer on Twitch.
[256:13.86]I give bits.
[256:14.58]Thanks for the $250.
[256:15.20]Appreciate it.
[256:18.76]Ya boy!
[256:19.28]Thanks for the $15.
[256:20.08]You're the most influential e-clown.
[256:23.62]Just e-clown, please.
[256:24.44]Let me just drop the prefix.
[256:29.54]Just e-clown, please.
[256:33.30]Ocean Dweller, thanks for 250.
[256:34.50]I know who makes those slot machines.
[256:36.44]I've been at their offices in Chicago for a luncheon.
[256:40.38]I almost worked there.
[256:44.15]That's crazy.
[256:46.21]That's awesome.
[256:49.09]Almost the depth of the Betty White slot machine.
[256:54.19]Damn.
[256:57.63]You almost met Betty White.
[257:03.94]No, guys.
[257:05.38]Betty White just, like, opened the book and read a few lines and dropboxed 35 seconds worth of footage.
[257:11.35]That's what happened.
[257:18.93]Hey, Spliceable Spleen, thanks for the five community subs.
[257:21.21]Thanks, Spleen.
[257:23.90]Reaper, thanks for the 250.
[257:25.08]Jerma, why don't you take your one anime a year to never watch JoJo?
[257:29.77]I feel if you were to watch even a single episode, it'll open the floodgates to even more JoJo bits, references, etc.
[257:35.13]It'll ruin the stream for the rest of us.
[257:37.28]Please, for the love of God, never watch it.
[257:38.86]Don't give in.
[257:42.46]I don't... This is correct.
[257:47.86]This is correct.
[257:49.54]Based.
[257:53.77]Hey, Mr. Mushi, thanks for the 500 bits.
[257:56.17]Hey, Jerma, you're my favorite e-clown, and I think you're very adequate.
[258:01.57]Thank you.
[258:04.17]Pugles, thanks for the 500 bits.
[258:05.63]Looking cute today, Jerma Chan.
[258:18.75]Uh...
[258:32.40]Thanks.
[258:32.64]Appreciate it.
[258:37.32]Also, thank you to DocD27 for the $7, 700 bits.
[258:45.18]I've been stuck in a metro system with what I can only assume is Mr. Sneakman.
[258:51.33]Metro system?
[258:54.53]What do you mean, where?
[258:59.51]What do you mean stuck in a metro system?
[259:06.28]I know train, but how do you get stuck?
[259:08.82]What happened?
[259:09.29]Did you miss the train?
[259:10.05]I hope you get that solved.
[259:17.89]Hey, Seven Layer Wario, thank you for the ten dollars.
[259:22.43]I actually really liked Bugleberry's pottery stream.
[259:25.59]Please do more streams where you make us pottery and eat spiders.
[259:28.69]Just get your makeup done to look like Bugleberry and skip the mask.
[259:39.11]Fucking spiders.
[259:43.95]Vilemi gave the 30 community subs.
[259:45.74]Thank you, Vilemi.
[259:47.66]More huge fucking money.
[259:51.10]And speaking of which, let us go ahead and run the credits showing all the subs from today.
[259:57.76]Four hours and 20 minutes.
[260:01.64]We're getting to the end here.
[260:04.68]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[260:05.78]Stick around, though.
[260:06.38]There's still a few more bits to do, or if not, take off if you want to.
[260:09.28]It's up to you.
[260:12.23]But again, thanks for the support.
[260:13.19]There was hundreds of subs and community subs given today, like there is.
[260:15.85]I feel like I say that every stream.
[260:18.17]Every stream, I feel like I say, thanks for the hundreds of community subs.
[260:21.83]Thanks for the hundreds of subs.
[260:23.03]You guys just continue to do it.
[260:26.57]And it's wild.
[260:30.99]So sincerely, thank you.
[260:33.37]All of you.
[260:38.18]We have a few more bits to do, though.
[260:40.70]have shy void gave 500 bits five dollars from shy void I just want to tell you not to be discouraged about trying to make art as a new year's resolution I wanted to be better at drawing because of great communities like this one a lot of it is just practice even if you're not satisfied with the quality you can always just keep practicing and improving this is very true but also keep in mind that I spend a significant amount of time
[261:08.61]doing this and even when the stream's not on a lot of my free time is based around this stream and trying to improve it and try to make new streams and try to um big projects and try to get contacts with people and this is kind of this is my this is like what I do instead of something like art
[261:31.81]And I think if I really, really tried to dump dozens and dozens and dozens of hours into something like learning how to draw, it would kind of cut into the time that I would want to spend working on stuff for the stream.
[261:46.76]And I care very much about it.
[261:50.20]This.
[261:52.43]Do an art stream?
[261:55.95]No, no, I can't.
[261:57.79]I can't.
[261:59.75]I love art.
[262:02.56]I love art.
[262:05.18]But I'd rather be an observer than a participant, if that makes any sense.
[262:10.76]It does.
[262:11.08]It makes perfect sense.
[262:12.39]I say that a lot.
[262:16.01]But thank you for the encouragement.
[262:20.26]Who's Barney?
[262:20.74]Barney...
[262:46.91]Barney.
[262:47.65]Oh, oh, Barney.

[263:57.79]Come on.
[264:05.14]Who?
[264:05.74]Who?

[264:29.76]No, I'm getting... Jerry Lewis is getting hoed.
[264:32.86]So that means that's, you know, that means I'm getting old.
[264:35.42]And it's okay.
[264:37.90]It's okay.
[264:42.10]Thank you.
[264:42.74]Appreciate the 300 bits.
[264:43.78]I tried my best.
[264:44.36]Throwaway985.
[264:45.76]Throwaway985.
[264:45.98]Gave $100.
[264:46.22]$10,000 bits.
[264:46.36]A few minutes ago, actually.
[264:51.28]Like, 15 minutes ago.
[264:52.50]And they say...
[265:11.67]In a sea of streamers playing the same old content, it's a fresh breath of air to find a streamer so consistently wholesome and charismatic as you've been.
[265:19.23]For countless hours, you've helped people escape dark places, made us cry with laughter and shared pain, both emotional and physical.
[265:26.66]I love that I can donate in good conscience, knowing it'll go to something and someone worthwhile.
[265:32.06]Please don't forget how much your community loves you, even more than you may love it.
[265:39.56]thank you throwaway985 I'm not sure who you know your true identity might be throwaway985 uh but I said this a lot of times I'm not I'm not necessarily trying to
[265:59.89]To be some bastion of content creation.
[266:03.83]You know what I mean?
[266:04.43]That's not really my goal.
[266:05.33]I just want to... I just want to have fun.
[266:08.65]I want to have fun.
[266:09.83]More than anything.
[266:15.35]That's all... That's my life.
[266:18.64]How can I make this fun?
[266:20.74]How can I make this more interesting for me?
[266:27.37]That's it.
[266:28.91]There's really no other ulterior motive besides... I just want to fucking laugh and have a good time.
[266:38.99]There's nothing else here that I care about.
[266:40.62]In a streaming sense, right?
[266:49.04]Now cry!
[266:49.72]Cry, Influencer!
[266:52.32]I'm talking about, you know, what about Kim?
[266:54.22]I'm talking about like in a streaming when I turn on my broadcast and what my goals are.
[267:00.62]You know what my goals are?
[267:04.11]I live for those moments where something can happen on these streams and collectively we all just laugh our fucking asses off.
[267:15.15]I strive for those moments.
[267:16.95]I care more about that than anything.
[267:19.02]Anything.
[267:24.88]And whether you think it's funny or not, then that's cool.
[267:28.22]Whatever.
[267:28.88]But I do.
[267:37.31]This is circle jerky.
[267:42.05]I'm not trying to make it like a...
[267:54.84]Brave Circle Jerky.
[268:01.30]If you think that, then maybe so, but... You gotta remember, there's a lot of people that say stuff like this about this community.
[268:08.35]And I address it, you know?
[268:10.01]People say this kind of stuff all the time.
[268:17.71]+2 to that guy.
[268:26.87]Let me tell you more about me and how fun I and this community, we're so much more fun and so much better than all the other streamers out there.
[268:36.63]That's what we do.
[268:37.84]Yeah, but I... Do you remember that time when we laughed at the guy peeing in The Sims?
[268:54.41]True.
[269:08.36]But that's another part of this equation, right?
[269:10.20]Like, I don't want... I don't want people to feel like that either, right?
[269:14.99]Like, oh, dude, this is kind of getting a little fucking, like, circle-y.
[269:17.63]Like, everyone's talking all this positive shit to each other.
[269:19.75]Like, you're getting a little circle jerky.
[269:21.23]It's like, I don't want you to... I don't want that to be a thing you think of either, right?
[269:27.44]I don't want that to be, like, the thing you take from this stream.
[269:29.94]It's like, oh, I just jumped in and, like... Well, everyone's just saying, everyone's just patting each other on the back.
[269:35.94]This is kind of boring.
[269:38.49]You know what I'm saying?
[269:44.60]Joel is mauling because of you.
[269:45.86]Well, he can... He can shot his... Is he watching right now?
[270:05.35]He's streaming now?
[270:06.77]Oh, burning bridges.
[270:07.83]That's what we do here.
[270:09.86]Now, long story short, this is how I'm going to end this.
[270:14.32]I'm just going to do me.
[270:17.20]If you like it, I'm glad.
[270:18.38]If you don't, then I'm sorry to hear that.
[270:19.98]Maybe you'll find somebody you do like.
[270:22.26]That's pretty much it.
[270:23.32]Done.
[270:24.12]Alright.
[270:24.64]No more going around in a circle about it.
[270:28.80]I'm sorry if it comes off that way.
[270:30.10]I really don't mean it to.
[270:33.34]Thank you, though.
[270:35.29]Grandpa Piss!
[270:43.64]Thanks for the 250, Grandpa Piss.
[270:47.26]As it's my last year as a teenager, I realize that I've been a fan for all my teen years.
[270:52.14]Thanks for always staying so genuine.
[270:54.01]It really does show that you care.
[270:55.97]We love you.
[270:58.13]Thank you, Grandpa Piss.
[271:00.07]Appreciate that.
[271:01.81]Wait, Joel said not to watch JoJo.
[271:10.97]He should read it?
[271:19.78]Wait, you can read JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?
[271:21.84]Is it a book?
[271:26.16]He just said he wished he could unwatch it.
[271:28.06]So why the fuck is that any confidence for me to watch a show?
[271:34.48]Dermot, watch JoJo.
[271:35.78]Oh, a person that you know said that they wish they could fucking unwatch it.
[271:40.47]But go watch every 500 episodes.
[271:48.40]Whatever.
[271:50.80]Read it.
[272:00.64]Thank you, Vilemi, for the 1500 bits.
[272:02.18]Jerma, you and this community are some of the best and most compassionate and uplifting people around.
[272:05.64]If it's not too much to ask, one of my best friends, Marley, is going through a really rough time in their life right now.
[272:10.46]I think it might help if they could hear some words of encouragement from their favorite streamer tonight.
[272:16.09]Keep going.
[272:18.45]Keep going in a good direction.
[272:21.01]And make sure you get the necessary help you need.
[272:27.87]I wish you the best.
[272:31.02]Life can get down.
[272:31.70]You have to keep trying though.
[272:37.61]And this goes for all of you.
[272:38.99]You know, if anyone's going through something horrible.
[272:40.91]Pain in their life.
[272:44.39]Also try to take steps to correct it.
[272:46.55]Try to take the necessary steps.
[272:50.14]Seek it out.
[272:57.40]Seriously, thank you.
[272:58.20]Marley.
[273:01.94]I hope it gets better.
[273:02.56]I really do.
[273:18.15]I was watching JoJo first episode and fell asleep and opened ping pong instead.
[273:21.65]Pretty good joke.
[273:25.47]Kitchy Cat.
[273:25.97]Kitchy Cat's the one that made the Fireman cartoon.
[273:28.94]Fireman cartoons, plural.
[273:30.98]Thanks for showing my Fireman cartoons.
[273:33.70]Happy you guys enjoyed them.
[273:35.76]Means the world to me.
[273:38.94]Yeah, hell yeah.
[273:39.81]They were awesome.
[273:41.17]It's obvious that a lot of work went into it, so... For sure.
[273:51.46]AlStoreH2O, thanks for the $2.50.
[273:53.30]This is the fourth time you've screened my baseball highlights video on stream.
[274:00.93]Thank you for all the love.
[274:08.65]That was the best video on YouTube, so of course I'm gonna fucking watch it.
[274:20.98]You think you'll still see it?
[274:29.86]Absolutely.
[274:31.95]Somebody will send it to somebody who will send it to me.
[274:34.59]Whether I see it in one of the channels or one of the mods sends it to me.
[274:37.67]I will see it.
[274:42.47]Thank you, though.
[274:43.11]Thank you, Eugene, for the 300 bits.
[274:44.48]I wanted to be a Chad this year, but I realize I don't have a chin like you.
[274:46.90]Any tips?
[274:51.15]No, zero.
[274:51.83]I don't have any tips.
[274:56.39]How to grow a chin?
[274:57.93]Oh, no, no, no.
[274:58.39]This says I don't have a chin like you.
[274:59.93]I'm like, wait, what the fuck?
[275:03.12]Eat more bananas.
[275:04.96]Get adequate rest.
[275:07.18]No chin tips.
[275:13.46]Where did you buy your chin?
[275:18.96]Chew gum to develop the Chad chin.
[275:24.16]Does that work?
[275:25.46]No.
[275:25.88]Wouldn't that just make your cheeks puffier?
[275:28.87]No, there's no way that works.
[275:33.35]Silence surrounding thanks for 250.
[275:34.87]You tap out at 30 hours.
[275:36.27]That's like four Jermist streams.
[275:40.69]Yeah, but imagine if each stream was 20 minutes long.
[275:48.88]Fuck, you actually got me there.
[275:53.48]No, you got me there.
[275:54.72]You got me there real bad.
[276:01.16]I'm tapping out.
[276:02.02]I'm tapping out.
[276:02.62]I'm fucking out of here.
[276:03.39]I'm tapping out.
[276:06.21]I'm tapping out, man.
[276:07.17]It's been too long.
[276:07.97]I'm tapping out.
[276:10.27]I have nothing to say.
[276:11.19]You just absolutely fucking destroyed me on stream.
[276:14.41]Like, you just humiliated me on my own stream.
[276:16.38]So, like, what am I going to say to that?
[276:17.48]Like, fuck you?
[276:18.46]Like, how dare you?
[276:20.22]Really, though, how fucking dare you do that on my stream?
[276:25.32]You're supposed to circle jerk me.
[276:27.96]No, damn.
[276:28.70]No.
[276:29.62]How dare you?
[276:32.21]Don't call me out on my fucking bad bullshit.
[276:38.61]We're supposed to do what?
[276:41.25]Oh, no.
[276:42.39]Yeah, whatever.
[276:44.89]Oh, it's alright.
[276:45.49]Who cares?
[276:46.11]Who cares?
[276:46.91]Who cares?
[276:47.57]Who cares?
[276:48.29]Who cares?
[276:48.81]I'm leaving, Jeremy.
[276:49.67]Stay.
[276:50.99]Stay.
[276:51.25]Don't go.
[276:52.55]I'll fix it.
[276:55.28]I'm going to fix it.
[276:56.22]I'll fix it.
[276:56.76]I'll fix it.
[276:57.16]I'll fix it.
[276:57.58]Don't go.
[276:58.58]Don't leave.
[276:59.56]I'm going to fix it.
[277:05.62]I'll fix it in a few streams.
[277:07.04]I'll talk about it some other time.
[277:09.52]Hey, Keith King Crimson, thanks for the 250 bits.
[277:12.00]JoJo is actually 150 episodes, but who cares?
[277:14.22]Alright, there you go.
[277:19.77]Don't leave.
[277:20.31]I can fix this.
[277:21.17]I love that.
[277:24.51]But who cares?
[277:26.59]Snooze and Cofter with three more bits to do.
[277:28.51]Actually, let's get to the real ending screen.
[277:31.13]Because it is the end.
[277:36.08]Jojo, you can't say Jojo.
[277:37.83]Jojo is just like, it just causes a cascade of stuff.
[277:47.88]Stop listening to what anyone's telling you.
[277:49.54]I have the solution.
[277:51.46]It's Redline.
[277:53.12]It's a fantastic anime, and it's not a show.
[277:55.62]It's a one and a half hour movie.
[277:56.98]Make this your anime of the year, and you will be glad to have made the decision to watch anime for once.
[278:01.62]Please watch this two minute trailer.
[278:03.20]No, no, no, no, no.
[278:05.31]No more animated video suggestions.
[278:07.93]No more animes.
[278:10.64]I'm gonna watch Courage the Cowardly Dog for my anime this year.
[278:13.43]You know what?
[278:13.83]I'm putting my foot down on this one.
[278:15.67]No.
[278:16.93]I'm gonna watch, like, seasons 1 through 4 of SpongeBob.
[278:21.51]Done.
[278:30.69]No, no more anime suggestions.
[278:33.11]Put it in the recommended channel for Discord.
[278:35.97]No, don't do that, because that's supposed to be for stream games.
[278:44.14]Courage sucks.
[278:49.53]Wow.
[278:50.67]Based.
[279:17.66]I'm sorry, that's a word I learned a week ago, and I've been using it in random places.
[279:23.56]Anyways, Apollyon, thank you for the 500 bits.
[279:26.78]My boyfriend and I watch your stream often.
[279:29.11]It's basically where our humor comes from.
[279:30.59]Thanks for all the fun.
[279:32.33]By the way, if you want to officiate our wedding, by all means.
[279:34.85]I can't officiate any weddings.
[279:35.89]It's the most nervous thing ever.
[279:39.13]You want me to officiate your wedding?
[279:40.27]People have said that two or three times.
[279:42.65]I will sneeze in your face and ruin the wedding.
[279:45.03]I'm not kidding.
[279:46.01]This is not a joke.
[279:47.23]I will, like... I will grab the book the wrong way and cut my finger and bleed and shit.
[279:52.22]And get, like, blood all over you.
[279:55.40]Everyone's clothes and the dress and the fucking groom's outfit.
[279:58.04]I'll ruin everything.
[279:59.12]You don't want me at your wedding.
[280:00.14]You don't want me officiating the wedding.
[280:01.44]Something bad will happen to me.
[280:03.12]And, like, I'll sneeze on you.
[280:04.06]I don't know.
[280:04.36]Something bad will happen.
[280:05.16]Based wedding.
[280:16.70]That's not me saying that.
[280:17.54]I just read that.
[280:18.20]Somebody just wrote that because it was just so stupid.
[280:24.04]Alright, I'm leaving.
[280:25.38]I'm out of here.
[280:25.82]You'll see me Tuesday.
[280:26.56]Oh, it's just me gave 500 bits.
[280:28.66]You're going to go to any future NFL games at the new Raiders Stadium?
[280:33.31]That's right, because they're going to be the Las Vegas Raiders.
[280:35.73]Also, since you're obviously the scout, I'm assuming you care about baseball.
[280:38.39]What do you think about the Astros cheating?
[280:41.85]They all cheat.
[280:42.97]All of them are cheating.
[280:44.97]I got some really bad, sad news for everybody here.
[280:49.03]Everybody in these sports is fucking cheating.
[280:52.15]They're all doing something they're not supposed to be doing.
[280:54.33]And then... Eventually, like, three of them get caught.
[281:02.48]Every year it's like, Oh, wow!
[281:05.02]Cleveland was really doing all this really fucked up stuff last year.
[281:08.04]Oh, the Astros were cheating.
[281:09.50]The Red Sox had these Apple Watches and they were cheating.
[281:12.75]Patriots spy on people remember when the New York Jets that everyone's fucking cheating.
[281:17.19]They're all cheating Guys, you're talking about a sport with people were on Human growth enhancing drugs for five straight years like 7,000 players Do you don't think that they're just everyone's just cheating every day?
[281:39.92]Everyone's just cheating
[281:42.98]We gotta look at the fundamental reasons why everyone's just cheating in all these sports.
[281:54.65]To win.
[281:55.11]Hey, who's winning?
[281:59.91]We all are.
[282:00.81]Oh, right.
[282:01.27]Yeah, okay.
[282:02.15]I have a dickhead.
[282:02.79]Sorry, bye.
[282:12.48]But yeah, the Vegas Raiders would be cool.
[282:16.62]The Golden Knights have done so many awesome things already.
[282:19.28]They almost won the Stanley Cup the first year that they were put into the NHL.
[282:22.32]So yeah, it's interesting, I guess.
[282:25.94]There's going to be more than just football in that stadium.
[282:29.88]So it'll be really, really cool stuff.
[282:33.44]I'm looking forward to it.
[282:35.67]We had a raid?

[284:24.82]Tell him I watched episode one and I'm, like, pissed off that he gave me the recommendation.
[284:29.24]Because, like, make it seem like that he told you guys to tell me to watch it, but he definitely didn't.
[284:37.32]And just make it, you know, just, like, just, you know, fuck him up a little bit.
