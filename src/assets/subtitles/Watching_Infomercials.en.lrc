[00:02.39]Let me clear it up.
[00:03.43]Let me clear it up because people are a little confused.
[00:07.43]People get a little confused and that's okay.
[00:09.16]I can help.
[00:11.26]I have 100% guaranteed that I would be late.
[00:15.54]I did not 100% guarantee I would be here at 420.
[00:16.84]I just said 100% guaranteed.
[00:17.90]100% I'm going to be late.
[00:29.46]I never said, what did I say?
[00:30.88]415.
[00:30.98]I said, I said 415 is what I'm looking at.
[00:38.16]I said, I 100% guarantee.
[00:44.49]Oh, shit.
[00:45.35]I got logs.
[00:46.23]I'll be back in a little bit to start.
[00:48.11]Definitely starting at like, at like 415, by the way.
[00:50.52]At like 415, by the way.
[00:57.20]Like 100% chance, 100% chance that I'm gonna be late.
[00:59.72]Like, like 4.15.
[01:00.08]I'll be around at like 4.15.
[01:00.73]Yeah, it's like 4.15, like 4.30, 4.15, 4.20, 4.25, 4.24.
[01:21.32]He's gaslighting.
[01:22.94]No, I said I was going to be like 415.
[01:24.50]Okay, let me ask you a question.
[01:30.91]If on the back of the microwave food box, like let's say you have like a turkey dinner in the microwave.
[01:36.71]If it's set on the back of the box, put in the microwave for like five minutes with a question mark.
[01:44.16]Would you trust it?
[01:47.66]No, you wouldn't.
[01:49.93]You want... You need an exact time.
[01:52.60]Saying like before time is not an exact time.
[02:03.85]I'll be back at like 4.15?
[02:06.25]If somebody says that, that means... Alright, I can't... It's gonna be like 4.10 to like 4.25.
[02:18.72]You're high on weed, 100% guaranteed.
[02:29.01]Where's the sponsor?
[02:30.63]We're not doing that yet.
[02:39.86]Can we get a comment of your obsession with being TikTok famous?
[02:48.29]Guys, I don't own the app TikTok.
[03:00.38]I don't even know if I'm on TikTok.
[03:05.04]All I know is that what I told you before, if I was on TikTok, I'd be huge.
[03:12.26]People keep coming to me.
[03:13.04]Hey, Jerma, did you see, like, this thing?
[03:14.43]It's got, like, 500 million views on it.
[03:16.81]And it's, like, you.
[03:18.41]Oh, okay.
[03:19.51]But you still don't believe me when I say I would be huge if I was on it.
[03:25.85]Oh, Jerma, like, they dedicated, like, a whole entire segment to you on TikTok here.
[03:29.45]It's, like, this big.
[03:30.05]It's got, like, 400,000 views.
[03:32.25]Oh, but no, I would not be... That would not be a thing on there if I started...
[03:41.93]I'd go on there and I'd change the world, okay?
[03:48.51]Okay, I'm fucking kidding.
[03:51.74]Imagine having that inflated of an ego that you think that, like, you as an E-clown would change everything if you made a TikTok account.
[04:06.75]That's next level.
[04:08.03]That is stratosphere level megalomania.
[04:12.35]Is he joking?
[04:12.85]Of course it's a joke.
[04:21.04]My TikTok will change the world.
[04:23.16]This guy's a Vin Diesel streamer.
[04:28.38]I kind of know what you mean by that, but at the same time, I don't.
[04:32.74]I don't know why I know what you mean, but I don't know what you mean at the same time.
[04:46.08]It's because you're bald.
[04:47.48]I'm not at all, actually.
[04:53.70]Let's go over what's going to happen today.
[04:55.60]First, let me clear my disgusting throat before people get grossed out.
[05:05.31]Okay.
[05:06.11]So this is going to be an interesting day.
[05:08.37]There's something happening on this stream that I've never done before, really.
[05:11.93]I'm testing to see how it works.
[05:13.87]Seeing how I like it.
[05:18.34]So let's go over what's happening.
[05:20.76]I've been watching a lot of infomercials.
[05:22.62]It's better than TV.
[05:25.06]As you see, I have my, I've got my, you know, on my list of, you know, how I feel about like greater than, less than.
[05:32.01]I actually think that a lot of infomercials are more interesting and more entertaining than television or movies.
[05:39.52]So I've been on a big kick of it.
[05:40.98]I get on a kick of watching infomercials.
[05:44.59]every maybe once a year or two.
[05:46.83]So I figured if I'm on the kick right now, there's so much shit to dissect in these videos and in these products.
[05:55.48]I kind of want to like, if I'm not going to, I'm going to watch them in bed anyways.
[06:02.14]And some of these, some of these products are insane.
[06:05.61]And some of them are just fun to watch.
[06:10.05]He's on a kick.
[06:11.09]Yeah.
[06:16.35]AP Sensory 2.0, absolutely no fucking chance.
[06:22.58]And then after we do this, this is just something that I was just like, I want to do this.
[06:25.94]I've been thinking about doing the infomercial watch, like, React Andy stream for a few months now.
[06:31.97]I just didn't know when to do it.
[06:34.35]But after that, we'll do this for a little while.
[06:37.07]I'm going to be playing the Serpent Rogue as a sponsor stream.
[06:43.83]I played the demo.
[06:45.05]I looked it up.
[06:45.53]I was like, this looks pretty fun.
[06:47.87]I... I guess I'll do it.
[06:49.87]Yeah.
[06:53.03]So what I need you guys to do is... This is the first time I've ever been sponsored on this stream.
[06:57.09]Besides, you know, obviously the dollhouse.
[07:00.07]You fucking better make me look good.
[07:01.61]You know what I'm saying?
[07:09.69]It's not going to happen.
[07:11.85]No way.
[07:12.45]We aren't doing that.
[07:13.79]You better make me look good.
[07:19.93]But in all honesty, I'm not messing around.
[07:22.28]Is Jeremy talking to you now?
[07:26.24]I've never done this before.
[07:28.26]So I really hope the game's fun.
[07:30.84]It does seem like it's a pretty fun, good experience from what I played.
[07:34.36]I don't know.
[07:35.24]We'll find out.
[07:36.02]It looks cool.
[07:40.88]And I will say this again, because I said it a couple days ago, but I will reiterate it.
[07:45.84]It's Jeremy talking to you now.
[07:51.39]I have been pretty selective so far with what has been presented to me.
[07:55.95]So don't worry.
[07:58.13]This is not going to just be a... Oh yeah, I'll take anything.
[08:02.27]Sure.
[08:03.37]How much are they paying?
[08:04.99]Oh yeah, fuck yeah.
[08:07.07]No, I've been very selective already.
[08:11.79]So this looks really fun.
[08:12.95]I'm actually interested.
[08:26.84]No, what?
[08:29.00]No, no, I'm not.
[08:30.34]I'm not going to even say out loud what you guys are saying.
[08:33.99]I'm not even going to say it out loud.
[08:36.74]But anyways, I got a lot of infomercials here.
[08:39.46]Some of these, I've seen these before.
[08:42.50]And I want to go over these products with you.
[08:44.70]By the way, some of these are like 10 to 20 years old.
[08:49.00]They may have been some new innovations since then.
[08:59.46]You need to sell these to us.
[09:02.92]Guys, half these products probably don't exist anymore.
[09:05.00]What are you talking... I mean, I don't think any of these exist.
[09:07.20]Some of these might not even exist.
[09:14.95]You going to bed?
[09:15.53]Have a good night.
[09:16.13]Hope you get a good rest.
[09:20.13]I can't sell them to you.
[09:22.53]We're getting sold to in these commercials.
[09:26.60]I mean, let's... Are you ready?
[09:27.84]Let's just go.
[09:29.28]I got... There's like 500 of these.
[09:33.04]I'm actually really excited.
[09:34.40]I love old infomercials.
[09:36.14]Alright, what do you guys, what do you think we want to start with?
[09:49.46]Over here?
[09:49.72]What do you think?
[09:53.06]I mean, I'm on, there's like 200 videos in this playlist.
[09:57.39]So, I mean...
[10:00.46]And I know I just, like, leaked it.
[10:02.09]But who cares?
[10:04.25]Look at this.
[10:05.35]These are kitchen appliances.
[10:12.99]Look at all these.
[10:14.07]The Betty Crocker all-in-one basket.
[10:17.07]The Miracle Grill.
[10:18.09]You know what's crazy about infomercials?
[10:22.36]You're on light mode.
[10:24.64]I don't know.
[10:28.82]What?
[10:30.97]He's obsessed with marketing.
[10:32.49]I'm obsessed with direct marketing.
[10:38.39]Direct marketing is just so bizarre.
[10:41.19]It's such a bizarro world.
[10:43.55]What's wrong with light mode?
[10:45.47]I can see.
[10:45.89]Should I turn off light mode?
[10:49.51]This dude's a tab hoarder.
[10:53.39]Well, it's not going to be bright because I'm about to... Look, we're going in full screen.
[10:57.87]Look, we're fine.
[10:59.55]It's fine.
[11:01.73]Alright, so this is the fill-in-flavor direct response infomercial.
[11:06.99]If you don't know what direct response is, direct response is when there is no, there's no like middleman.
[11:13.92]They don't like, this is not like in Walmart.
[11:16.04]It's not in Target.
[11:17.20]It's just manufacturer direct marketing to consumer.
[11:20.88]And it's always insane.
[11:23.72]Are you ready?
[11:24.68]Let's just go.
[11:25.06]This is the fill-in-flavor.
[11:26.28]I'm going to give you my thoughts.
[11:27.14]I think my screen might be too big.
[11:29.84]Actually, why don't we just turn it off for each one?
[11:33.15]Can I?
[11:33.43]Let's go.
[11:33.93]Okay, there we go.
[11:36.11]Fill in flavor.
[11:37.45]Do your homemade cakes look and taste the same?
[11:40.35]Old-fashioned.
[11:41.25]No filling.
[11:41.93]Boring and plain?
[11:42.99]Well, not anymore.
[11:44.41]Now there's the Funtastic Fill in Flavor by Perfect Bakeware.
[11:48.13]Okay.
[11:48.41]The revolutionary cake-making wonder that lets you bake, fill, and decorate.
[11:52.29]I've seen this one.
[11:53.05]It's so easy.
[11:54.03]Turn it up.
[11:54.27]Just pour in any cake mix.
[11:55.77]Lock on the magic center insert.
[11:57.75]Hold on.
[11:58.13]First of all, I know people are going to be like, stop pausing!
[12:02.05]What is this?
[12:04.11]This looks like cheese.
[12:05.67]This is brie?
[12:08.31]What happened?
[12:13.42]Don't pause.
[12:14.70]I'm gonna be pausing.
[12:18.10]Alright.
[12:19.40]I want you to do an experiment with me, guys.
[12:22.14]Every time they do a black and white look at this person screw something up, or look at how bad this looks, imagine the person is like 10 beers deep.
[12:32.61]This is just like the person is trashed.
[12:36.02]If you think like that, this makes sense.
[12:40.50]This person is shit-faced, and they decided to make a cake.
[12:44.67]I'm telling you, all of them think that way.
[12:46.95]We'll stop it each time.
[12:48.29]I remember so many of these, too.
[12:58.91]Oh, you can do it with the kids!
[12:59.85]Okay.
[13:00.01]Alright.
[13:00.33]It's so thrilling.
[13:00.87]That's a huge fucking feast!
[13:01.97]Who's gonna eat that?
[13:02.77]Is one of the kids gonna eat this?
[13:04.57]Yeah, no shit they're surprised.
[13:05.61]It's like mom's giving us the whole cake.
[13:31.05]That's so much.
[13:33.03]That's way too much.
[13:34.91]Chocolate pudding.
[13:35.51]I'd eat that.
[13:36.27]Yep.
[13:36.43]Oh, look at our shit face.
[13:37.77]This person is... Look at our shit face.
[13:39.93]Okay.
[13:40.21]Remember, this person, it's like 3 o'clock in the morning and they know they have a pie in the fridge.
[13:54.18]And two or three of them in the room are like, yo, pie, right, dude?
[13:57.78]Oh, let's get it.
[13:58.45]We had this?
[13:58.75]Did it work?
[13:59.03]Wait a minute.
[14:12.12]Whose hands are these?
[14:14.50]Oh, I thought that was a batting glove.
[14:16.38]I was like, why is a baseball player serving this?
[14:19.75]I thought that was a fucking golf glove.
[14:21.71]Yeah, I just made a few cakes for the boys in the locker room.
[14:28.50]What's wrong with this one?
[14:29.76]I don't know about that one.
[14:30.78]That's actually kind of... That's kind of cool.
[14:33.06]What?
[14:33.36]What?
[14:57.93]That's bullshit.
[14:58.73]They won't even potentially have a center filling?
[15:01.46]Two?
[15:12.65]I have a question for everybody.
[15:13.79]I've had this theory since I was like 15 or 16, whatever.
[15:17.61]So when they say, oh, and if you act now, you'll get a second one free.
[15:22.36]Almost every single infomercial that you'll see on all these lists, on all these videos, they did that.
[15:28.42]And was that just you're paying for two?
[15:32.43]We just say this is how much it costs for one.
[15:39.52]That's how that works, right?
[15:41.40]That's the idea.
[15:43.92]Oh, and remember, if you get this, you get two for just $19.99.
[15:49.05]The price is $19.99 for this, but you get two.
[15:51.89]So they're $10 each, right?
[15:53.79]It has to be.
[15:59.33]Maybe it's not, but I'm just saying.
[16:00.75]I remember that was a big thing.
[16:03.65]Or they'd give you other stuff.
[16:05.66]It was like, yeah, it's $39.99 for this.
[16:07.80]And they show all the commercials, they show everything.
[16:09.27]And all of a sudden they'll be like, but hold on a second.
[16:11.45]You also get the scissors too.
[16:14.03]And the swimming goggles.
[16:17.39]It's like, wait, did you just kind of, did you just sell me three things and just added all the prices together?
[16:26.04]That used to happen.
[16:27.92]This thing's kind of cool.
[16:29.67]Fill in flavor.
[16:30.45]Alright, yeah, and I... Okay, well, here's the thing, guys.
[16:33.77]None of these fucking... Don't fucking do that.
[16:35.95]Don't be an idiot.
[16:37.37]Alright, what about the clever tongs?
[16:47.03]Spatulas and tongs have been around forever.
[16:49.34]But try to flip and food flops.
[16:51.66]Try to grip and food drops.
[16:52.56]Shit-faced.
[16:53.22]I'm telling you, shit-faced.
[16:54.64]You need clever tongs.
[16:56.46]The two-in-one kitchen.
[16:58.58]Try to grip and... Look at how drunk this person is.
[17:02.26]Food flops.
[17:03.91]Try to... Grip and food drops.
[17:08.17]Stop.
[17:11.97]I imagine somebody sitting across the table.
[17:16.81]Right?
[17:17.45]Like, somebody's sitting here.
[17:19.31]And it's like, like, Mom!
[17:21.35]Mom!
[17:21.99]Ow!
[17:22.67]They're getting, like, burnt.
[17:23.65]Whoa!
[17:23.79]Actually, this is pretty cool.
[17:25.66]So it's got, like, a canvas?
[17:28.00]Hammock.
[17:28.68]I got it wrong.
[17:46.75]Why would you want to hoist a whole pot roast?
[17:48.97]Like with your one hand?
[17:49.97]Alright, you went- alright.
[17:51.21]I had to use it.
[17:51.81]This is actually pretty awesome.
[18:14.40]All right, I got a question.
[18:15.08]How many of you guys have made burgers?
[18:18.58]Right?
[18:19.94]And here's the thing about pans.
[18:21.82]You ready for this?
[18:22.40]Listen to this.
[18:22.74]This is important.
[18:24.56]I didn't know this, but like, you can't use certain utensils in certain pans.
[18:30.25]There's like a bunch of rules that I didn't know about.
[18:33.15]Like, oh, hey, yeah, let me flip your burger with my spatula.
[18:36.45]Don't do that.
[18:38.96]Don't fucking do that.
[18:40.26]You're going to ruin everything.
[18:41.26]I'm like, um...
[18:43.25]What about this tool?
[18:44.14]No, that'll cause damage.
[18:45.82]You have to use this specific tool.
[18:47.94]You have to use this specific silicone to pick that up.
[18:52.28]Okay.
[18:53.48]Oh, shit.
[18:54.02]I didn't know that.
[18:54.86]And I didn't know that up until like, I would say maybe like five years ago, I did not know that.
[19:01.25]Chef Andy, right?
[19:03.29]So a product like this, I'm just going to be very honest with you.
[19:09.71]I support it because this just works in any pan.
[19:13.06]Nobody's going to yell at you.
[19:14.40]Mom's not going to be pissed.
[19:15.64]You're not going to scratch anything.
[19:16.76]You're not going to be... Look at how much asparagus can fit in that, by the way.
[19:19.98]Look at how much asparagus without it falling.
[19:22.55]Or scoop, lift, and serve an amazing Philly cheesesteak in seconds.
[19:26.49]Clever Tongs is the handy two-in-one helper you need to grip and flip that king-sized ribeye with ease.
[19:32.12]And by the way, guys, that was a king-sized ribeye, not just a regular-sized ribeye.
[19:35.36]That's an extra.
[19:35.92]That's like another 70 cents for McDonald's.
[19:38.01]That's a super size.
[19:39.01]Does this still exist?
[19:43.65]I hope so.
[19:45.23]I might just get it.
[19:48.31]What was this called?
[19:51.13]The Clever Tongs?
[19:52.55]Okay, that thing's actually fucking pretty good.
[19:54.89]I actually, like... I always, okay.
[19:57.70]Even with the right tool, I will always go like this.
[20:01.82]Everybody does this, and don't tell me you don't, because it sucks.
[20:04.86]You got a spatula...
[20:07.13]And you go down, you try to get under slowly, and you end up just moving the patty to the edge of the pan.
[20:14.80]And then you end up just like kind of taking your finger and like touching the edge and like lifting it and then letting go.
[20:25.68]I'm so sick of doing that.
[20:28.96]Because like the spatulas, even the silicone ones, they don't get under.
[20:32.54]They kind of just like push and slide.
[20:37.32]I think I flip half of hamburgers I've ever flipped in my life, unless they were on a grill.
[20:42.60]Because a grill, like, don't matter.
[20:44.78]A grill, like, who cares if, like, you're using the right utensils.
[20:48.16]It's just like, you just take it, you fucking flip it, you get, like, grease all over it, doesn't matter.
[20:53.42]But, like, it sucks doing that.
[20:56.42]Target audience.
[20:59.94]No, I mean, okay, I would say I would want that one.
[21:05.21]Also, back in the, um, we're going to just watch, this is Egg Genie.
[21:08.39]I'll give a preference to this, though.
[21:10.53]I don't know what it was with, like, the mid to late 90s and, like, the early 2000s and, like, mid 2000s with eggs in the microwave.
[21:20.25]I don't, why?
[21:21.33]It was a huge thing.
[21:25.74]Eggs in the microwave.
[21:28.60]There were so many products that did it.
[21:31.34]It's like, oh, put your egg in this, and it'll turn, and in a minute, you'll have an egg.
[21:35.47]Eggs don't take that long, though.
[21:38.51]If you just do, like, scrambled egg, I mean, the pan, yeah, maybe you mess up the pan, you get it all dirty, but there was an obsession in, like, the early 2000s with cooking eggs in the microwave with our device.
[21:48.76]Okay, hold on, let's see.
[21:54.16]I'm curious.
[21:54.78]Soft boiled eggs that are too hard.
[21:57.32]Hard boiled eggs that are too soft.
[21:59.32]Do your boiled eggs look like this?
[22:01.56]What a mess.
[22:02.88]Introducing... Wait, hold on.
[22:06.95]That's a poached egg and it looks great.
[22:08.99]That looks like a really great poached egg.
[22:13.63]What do they mean?
[22:14.49]Like this?
[22:15.93]What a mess.
[22:17.64]Isn't that a poached?
[22:18.22]That looks good.
[22:18.96]I would eat that.
[22:19.60]Put that on a piece of toast.
[22:21.64]That's a poached egg.
[22:23.62]Introducing Egg Genie, the automatic egg cooker that cooks perfect soft-boiled, medium-boiled, or hard-boiled eggs every time.
[22:31.39]Don't lug that heavy pot of water.
[22:33.23]Also, I'm sure a lot of people are probably noticing the Nolan North of all infomercial voiceovers.
[22:39.61]This guy.
[22:41.25]Introducing the Egg Wave.
[22:43.05]This guy probably was... This guy probably made...
[22:47.44]God damn.
[22:47.92]I don't know man, but this guy probably made thousands of dollars an hour He would probably he probably just the guy like the guy he was the voice and I think he's still going With egg genie just fill the measuring beaker with water to oh, it's not in the microwave base Then pierce eggs with piercing pin place up to seven eggs in unit and cover egg genie steam cooks your eggs to perfect consistency in minutes exactly as you ordered so now you can prepare perfect soft-boiled eggs for
[23:15.59]delicious eggs benedict or hard-boiled for a healthy protein-rich salad make egg salad sandwiches for a scrumptious luncheon nice egg genie whipping up a party platter of deviled eggs I thought it was all right that's kind of cool I thought it was going to be uh tastes hard and rubbery but they're fine like shut off a continuous audible signal that prevents overcooking but it's like a bug zapper
[23:42.26]Don't mind that.
[23:42.98]It's just the bugs being zapped.
[23:44.46]Because when you turn it upside down, it's also a bug zapper.
[23:47.74]Indicator light shut off and continuous audible signal that prevents overcooking.
[23:52.46]Now it's a breeze to stick to your diet with quick and easy low-cal snacks that always taste just right.
[23:57.74]That's kind of cool.
[23:58.52]Egg Genie also comes with its own steamer tray.
[24:01.40]All right.
[24:02.03]Okay.
[24:02.49]All right.
[24:02.89]You got me.
[24:03.37]Okay.
[24:03.65]But wait.
[24:04.09]What are they giving us?
[24:04.79]There it is.
[24:05.45]The bacon wave.
[24:06.41]All right.
[24:06.67]All right.
[24:32.81]Everything had to be a genie too, yeah.
[24:36.39]Okay, so let me tell you what I think about this.
[24:38.35]I'm into it.
[24:41.61]I thought this was going to be a microwave thing, but that was unfair.
[24:47.15]It's just a steamer that has one setting probably, right?
[24:50.11]But, I mean, that's... I probably would have used this.
[24:56.95]The thing about all these products, these kind of like direct marketing products, the problem with a lot of them was...
[25:02.80]They kind of really only did one thing.
[25:06.58]They just did one thing.
[25:10.18]And they always made a point to like, oh, you have so much bullshit on your counter and so much dog shit in your pantry.
[25:18.32]This is just a steamer that has one setting.
[25:22.10]They always made a point about this, how you had too much bullshit.
[25:25.56]But they were just trying to sell you a product that did one thing.
[25:29.74]Although I would say I probably would have used this.
[25:31.51]Because cooking hard eggs actually is a pain in the ass.
[25:34.53]But I wouldn't want to microwave them.
[25:35.57]Steaming them sounds pretty interesting.
[25:36.57]I've never done that before.
[25:38.93]That sounds good.
[25:42.95]That's actually pretty cool.
[25:45.03]I'm into it.
[25:45.67]I have not seen one that I've been like, no, no thanks.
[25:49.95]There's a lot.
[25:50.83]This is so much fun.
[25:52.31]I love this.
[25:52.97]This is like the funnest thing ever.
[25:54.95]Okay.
[25:55.11]How about the perfect slicer?
[25:57.87]Slicers are weird.
[26:03.48]This is how a comedian slices a watermelon.
[26:06.10]But when it comes to doing... All right, first of all, I made this reference like two months ago, and there it is.
[26:12.57]That's a Galaga reference, and I'm so glad that you got to see it.
[26:19.50]this is how a comedian slices a watermelon but when it comes to doing it yourself careful bro bro what the I want watermelon dude get in there I'm trying dude sucks
[26:42.46]Just imagine you hear the word bro like three times in the corner.
[26:44.42]You fucking do it.
[26:44.88]That thing's scary.
[26:57.44]Don't hold the knife like this.
[26:58.86]It's not like a fucking lightsaber.
[27:00.38]Holy shit.
[27:01.08]Cantaloupe sucks.
[27:02.12]That kind of got... Hold on.
[27:02.96]Wait a minute here.
[27:03.62]This is kind of... That kind of got messed up.
[27:30.68]Perfect veggie platter in a breeze.
[27:32.52]What?
[27:32.76]I don't like cantaloupe.
[27:33.40]Perfect sprouting onion with ease.
[27:35.41]In no time, make a healthy salad for lunch or create exciting dishes for a fabulous brunch.
[27:40.57]They should have leaned way heavier into that.
[27:44.29]Yeah, they should have, yeah, lean into that.
[27:47.37]Oh, I thought the guy did it 120 times.
[27:49.13]I thought it was like, we made this guy do this 150 times and he said it was easy.
[28:11.42]Another thing I want you to pay attention to and look for here is ba-ba-ba-something-something technology.
[28:17.87]Keep an eye on that.
[28:19.43]They would say like two or three words and then add technology to the end.
[28:24.49]And it was supposed to be like, oh, wow, that's like a scientist had to have come up with that.
[28:28.02]You'll also get the five-piece perfect storage system.
[28:30.26]It uses advanced freshness technology.
[28:32.66]Advanced freshness technology.
[28:35.77]What is advanced freshness technology?
[28:38.53]What is the tech behind that?
[28:41.23]Technology.
[28:43.90]Advanced freshness.
[28:44.86]I don't know.
[28:47.06]I think the cutting thing is cool.
[28:48.28]You know how many times I've actually had like a cake or something?
[29:00.36]Or pineapple, too.
[29:00.96]Yeah, I'd be like, pineapple.
[29:02.12]But I don't know.
[29:02.54]I feel like I'd be kind of scared to do that.
[29:03.88]Wouldn't you?
[29:05.44]Going like this and pushing.
[29:07.23]Because the thing might be wobbling around.
[29:08.73]I might be kind of scared to do that.
[29:14.55]Alright, this looks like a pretty similar realm here.
[29:16.35]This is the Jiffy Fries.
[29:19.14]By the way, I'm so glad this exists.
[29:22.96]As seen on TV blog.
[29:24.32]Oh my god, they probably have everything.
[29:26.06]I can't.
[29:26.50]I'm so happy.
[29:28.89]Mmm, nothing should come between you and fresh, hot, crispy French fries.
[29:33.73]But making them at home is a pain.
[29:36.22]And freezer fries just aren't the same.
[29:39.18]Well, that was frozen.
[29:39.84]Now you can enjoy fresh, delicious fries in a Jiffy.
[29:42.68]Introducing Jiffy Fries, the fast, fresh, easy way to make perfect French fries every day.
[29:49.81]Just load and push down to safely slice the perfect size fries.
[29:52.95]Okay, this is a small version of what we just saw.
[29:55.93]Just minutes, you've got hot, delicious, perfectly crisp fries.
[29:59.77]The secrets in the Jiffy Fries Hot Pod.
[30:01.94]Is that an apple?
[30:02.62]Crisp fries.
[30:03.76]Crisp fries.
[30:05.00]Crisp fries.
[30:06.12]The secrets in the Jiffy Fries Hot Pod.
[30:08.68]Brand new crisping technology in the pot.
[30:11.68]What is that?
[30:12.08]What is that?
[30:12.42]Brand new crisping technology.
[30:14.30]Brand new crisping technology.
[30:16.45]The pod circulates the heat above, below, and in between the fries so that every fry is cooked to the perfect temperature and texture.
[30:24.47]Makes sense.
[30:25.13]Need a quick pick-me-up?
[30:26.45]Jiffy Fries are a great midday snack you can make in a snap.
[30:30.24]Thinking about burgers for dinner?
[30:32.06]Jiffy Fries makes every dish a winner.
[30:34.54]Now, scrumptious snacks and quick, easy meals are just a- They didn't do it!
[30:38.92]They didn't- Hey, excuse me!
[30:40.64]I expect a fucking cartoon crunch!
[30:43.63]What the fuck?
[30:45.05]What a load of shit.
[30:45.79]Those are fucking pretty good.
[30:47.39]It's back.
[30:48.03]Okay.
[30:48.35]Don't you think that's the kind of sound...
[31:12.67]when you hear that sound you go oh like that something in there is not supposed to be that doesn't seem hard bacon jiffy fries okay you don't you don't move you kind of freeze and you go what was that what was that what was that what was that is a tooth what was that was that in there
[31:30.94]Who's doing that, though?
[31:42.38]Um... I mean, I get it.
[31:44.52]I get what they're going for here, but... If you go to the... If you go to the freezer aisle in your grocery store, and you get frozen fries?
[31:53.62]Like, what, the Ore-Ida has, like, a frozen bunch of stuff, right?
[31:58.24]Those are good.
[31:59.34]Those are fine.
[32:00.54]Those taste great.
[32:03.04]They have, like, the fast food, like, shoestring style.
[32:06.69]They're great.
[32:08.27]You just put them out on the, on a pan.
[32:10.23]You put it in the oven.
[32:11.79]Like, what, whatever, however long, like, 15 minutes or so?
[32:14.65]It's, it tastes, it's good.
[32:15.69]It's really good.
[32:16.31]They're great.
[32:18.97]I, it's like the do it fast, but is it really that fast, though?
[32:22.53]Because you have to cut the potato.
[32:26.27]And I feel like going from potato, like I got to go get a potato and like wash it and like clean it and then put it here and then cut it.
[32:36.85]I feel like that's too much.
[32:40.13]I'm not sure I would be into this product.
[32:41.30]I'm more into that.
[32:41.92]I want whatever that is.
[32:42.72]I'm interested in that.
[32:43.46]But, I mean, what's in the secret seasoning?
[32:45.08]What about your health?

[34:01.57]I've actually, my mother used to make zucchini noodle soup.
[34:05.02]It was fucking fire.
[34:06.18]It was good.
[34:06.56]Okay.
[34:06.74]Okay.
[34:07.14]I get it.
[34:07.52]What else?
[34:08.04]Okay.
[34:29.09]What?
[34:29.61]I thought that was an onion.
[34:31.40]Okay.
[34:31.80]All right.
[34:32.38]All right.
[34:33.06]It looks like a mess.
[34:34.16]I'm sorry.
[34:35.04]This is cool, but like totally just looks like a mess.
[34:39.16]That's a big deal.
[34:40.94]Okay.
[34:41.68]That's what I was concerned about.
[35:01.11]I was concerned about that.
[35:02.12]I get the idea.
[35:03.18]It's an interesting idea.
[35:04.54]Picky Eaters.
[35:04.96]Pesto?
[35:23.58]Ooh, this is ribbon slicing now.
[35:25.06]That kind of looks gross.
[35:26.64]It looks like a salad with way too much dressing on it.
[35:47.05]Alright, does it do apples?
[35:49.81]Right, okay.
[35:50.45]So, it's like a peeler, essentially, but a little more involved.
[35:53.84]I'm into it.
[35:54.18]I think it's cool.
[35:56.50]I think that's fine.
[36:00.71]Yeah, I probably, okay, look, okay.
[36:03.74]If you've had this on the counter, and I, like, came, you've invited me to your house or something, and you're like, oh, hey, dude, like, come on, come over.
[36:10.62]I'm like, oh, I'll come over, this sounds fun.
[36:12.36]So I get there, and I, like, put my backpack down, and I put my baseball cap down, and I sit on the couch or whatever, and you say, oh, hey, look what I got, I've got the Vigetti.
[36:21.56]I'd look over, and I'd be like, whoa, let's do it, let's go, let's do it, let's do it, that'd be fun.
[36:26.57]Like, that'd be the fun thing that we would do.
[36:29.26]And I would have a good time doing that, I think.
[36:32.11]I think it would be fun to do that.
[36:35.27]Why do you have a backpack on?
[36:40.31]No, it's not a Grindr date.
[36:52.62]Okay, fuck that.
[36:54.10]I'm out of here.
[36:55.26]Alright, the Vigetti Pro, I give it a fucking 7.
[36:59.11]What about the perfect pancake?
[37:00.29]You flip, but they flop.
[37:01.77]You flip, but they flop.
[37:03.45]Now your pancakes are a mess.
[37:04.97]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[37:06.45]Okay.
[37:07.81]Remember, shit-faced.
[37:11.79]You flip, but they flop.
[37:13.27]You flip, but they flop.
[37:14.95]Now your pancakes are a mess.
[37:16.68]And all that butter and fat to cook them?
[37:18.94]There's got to be a better way.
[37:20.38]Hi, Mark Gill here.
[37:21.80]If I was trashed, I would love those.
[37:23.54]The fast, easy spatula.
[37:25.04]Yeah, there was a million of these.
[37:27.58]There was so many of these.
[37:28.52]Watch.
[37:32.30]Burnt on cheese.
[37:32.82]They always use that as an example.
[37:59.38]Watch what happens with the perfect pancake pan.
[38:02.02]Four eggs over easy.
[38:03.46]All right.
[38:03.98]Ever-breaking a yolk.
[38:05.28]Amazing.
[38:05.89]All right.
[38:06.33]That was kind of cool.
[38:07.11]Gingerbread pancakes, fluffy cranberry, or mountains of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids in an instant.
[38:13.03]You can also make delicious dessert crepes.
[38:16.99]Oh, egg sandwiches!
[38:18.96]Just like from a restaurant!
[38:21.04]Alright, I don't know why, I just imagine... Okay, pan the camera up and there's a fucking lit- there's a person with a lit cigarette in their mouth.
[38:36.31]And there's only like half left.
[38:38.93]And they're just like sitting there with- they're just smoking.
[38:41.65]That's- I just see a cigarette.
[38:43.15]I see like just a lit cigarette.
[38:48.60]Slimesicle, welcome!
[38:49.60]Thanks for the raid.
[38:50.98]Welcome, everybody.
[38:51.52]We're doing product reviews.
[38:53.40]Uh, infomercial product reviews.
[38:54.99]Hope you had a good stream.
[38:55.73]Welcome.
[38:57.81]This was the pancakes all at once.
[38:59.59]I don't even know what this was called.
[39:01.89]But, thanks.
[39:02.75]Welcome.
[39:03.03]I... Everything was $19.95.
[39:15.98]If you had a product back in, like, the mid-2000s or early, kind of early 2000s or late 90s, and your product was less or more than $19.95, you lost board members.
[39:25.78]Executives would leave.
[39:31.53]All right, yeah, that's all right.
[39:34.29]That's cool.
[39:37.93]What about this one?
[39:39.50]All right, here we go.
[39:40.02]Mighty Meatballs.
[39:41.18]This one's going to be interesting.
[39:45.40]Mark Gill.
[39:45.90]I trust him.
[39:46.42]Stuffed meatballs?
[40:08.65]That was huge.
[40:09.63]That was a fucking softball.
[40:11.29]Who's making that?
[40:13.59]Wait a minute.
[40:14.11]Wait a minute.
[40:14.55]Wait a minute.
[40:14.97]That was a softball.
[40:16.19]Oh, it's your god.
[40:16.59]Grandma has Italian meatballs.
[40:18.33]Holy shit.
[40:18.61]How's that big?
[40:19.29]Ah, it's not that big.
[40:20.15]Mmm.
[40:20.25]Mmm.
[40:40.12]I don't know about that.
[40:41.47]I don't know about that.
[40:42.57]I don't know about that.
[40:43.27]I get the stuffed burger thing, but stuffed meatballs, I'm not so sure.
[40:45.29]Bacon, mac and cheese, meatballs.
[40:46.01]I feel like this is a kid's menu.
[40:46.87]Is this the kid's menu?
[40:47.45]Okay.
[41:04.65]Yeah, this is like... What the fuck?
[41:05.93]I get it.
[41:06.23]I get the idea.
[41:07.09]What about Easy Butter?
[41:32.51]Everyone loves butter, but getting it out of the fridge, out of the wrap, and onto your food is a real hassle.
[41:39.24]Introducing Easy Butter.
[41:40.70]The fast, easy... Okay, the problem was not the butter.
[41:44.74]The problem was you leaving your toast in the toaster for like 40 minutes.
[41:48.72]Alright, that is amazing.
[41:50.38]Just open the top, slide in your butter or margarine, and give a simple click.
[41:54.00]Alright, this is fucking awesome, actually.
[41:55.42]With a perfect pat size every time, guaranteed.
[41:58.70]So you'll never have to take out the knife and greasy butter.
[42:01.35]Holy shit.
[42:06.04]This is awesome.
[42:07.10]What?
[42:07.38]Alright.
[42:07.80]Do they still make this?
[42:09.83]That's insane.
[42:10.41]Am I insane for liking this?
[42:11.75]What?
[42:35.08]Okay, this is an incredible product, I think.
[42:39.95]You don't want your, like, five-year-old daughter saying that, by the way.
[42:44.14]You don't want to... You know, where's the vegetables?
[42:48.42]Where are the vegetables?
[42:49.64]Where's the zucchini slicer?
[42:52.04]Where's the zucchini slicer?
[42:52.97]We need that back.
[42:54.63]Where's the zucchini slicer?
[42:57.43]What is that?
[42:58.11]Who's doing that?
[42:58.71]I like this though.
[43:00.15]Alright, so it's $5.
[43:25.93]Cheese?
[43:27.03]Wait, there's more?
[43:28.23]Why would you put a hot dog in there?
[43:30.39]Hold on.
[43:30.89]What?
[43:31.13]Hot?
[43:31.21]A hot dog?
[43:31.59]Why would you put a hot dog in there?
[43:32.77]For little kids.
[43:33.23]It's fun to, I mean... Slicing a hot dog is not as difficult as slicing cold butter.
[43:57.49]Bananas?
[44:00.05]Cutting a hot dog is simple.
[44:03.66]I could cut a hot dog up in, like, literally five seconds.
[44:06.02]It's just, like, one, two, three, four, five.
[44:08.08]It's not a big deal.
[44:09.00]Cutting butter is hard.
[44:10.60]All right, that's pretty sick.
[44:13.24]I'd say of all the products we've seen, of, like, the ten we've seen, I like that one the most.
[44:19.67]What an easy eggwich.
[44:23.92]wish you had time for a delicious breakfast sandwich every morning now you can with the new easy egg witch the fast easy way to make a perfect egg sandwich in one minute just add an egg or two to the easy egg witch place on the lid and pop it in the microwave in just yeah I'm telling you microwave eggs were a big deal back in like the mid 2000s delicious the secret is the unique steam dome design that circulates heat okay the other steam products to cook
[44:51.67]Didn't need to go in the microwave.
[44:52.69]What was the egg, Jenny?
[44:53.65]That's kind of thick, too.
[45:21.67]Okay.
[45:23.09]It's easy, though.
[45:24.83]It's simple.
[45:25.77]Whatever.
[45:27.27]And that was another thing, too.
[45:34.48]Why were people so obsessed with this, too?
[45:37.42]Help me with this.
[45:39.02]Oh, and cooking in oil.
[45:40.26]No one wants to do that.
[45:45.32]Olive oil is, like, fucking not bad for you.
[45:47.94]Cooking in, like, an olive oil?
[45:49.66]Like, a light olive oil?
[45:50.80]What's...
[45:52.85]And then think about how much oil you'll be using.
[45:57.24]What was like the war on fat?
[46:00.08]Like fats.
[46:02.04]No, no, no, no, no.
[46:03.06]Don't have those omega-3s.
[46:04.52]Don't eat them.
[46:05.70]Don't touch those.
[46:07.40]Look, we're going to have a tray that all the oil drips into this tray.
[46:11.36]And then don't eat that.
[46:12.22]That's disgusting.
[46:13.48]How vile.
[46:16.76]Oil is a good oil, like an olive oil, like sunflower oil.
[46:20.57]This stuff is not bad for you.
[46:23.23]It's not bad for you.
[46:24.35]It actually has a lot of benefits.
[46:30.73]Olive oil is fantastic for you.
[46:35.07]Well, not essential oil.
[46:37.79]Sunflower oil is bad.
[46:39.04]I'm talking about olive oil.
[46:42.18]Avocado oil.
[46:42.96]You ever cook with avocado oil before?
[46:46.83]If you cooked with a good olive oil, it adds to your food, doesn't take away from it.
[46:52.79]Carbs are killer.
[46:57.06]Peanut oil is amazing.
[46:58.24]Yeah, dude, what is with this war on oil?
[47:00.30]I don't get that.
[47:00.82]But, put butter all over everything.
[47:02.76]I love butter!
[47:11.11]Oil.
[47:11.79]Ugh.
[47:13.03]Ugh.
[47:14.25]Oh, it's oil.
[47:15.49]Even the word.
[47:17.09]Oil.
[47:18.17]It's like, what, come out of the ground?
[47:20.41]Yeah, what's going on here?
[47:22.27]And they always show it like eating steaks.
[47:26.55]Oh, it can even flip an eight pound steak.
[47:30.62]Don't cook it in that disgusting oil.
[47:33.25]Alright, we get it.
[47:33.77]Ah, I wouldn't get it.
[47:34.43]I wouldn't buy that one.
[47:35.15]How about Burrito Perfect?
[47:50.58]Love burritos, but hate the mess?
[47:52.76]You fill, fold, and roll, but could never get that perfect hold.
[47:56.26]That's true.
[47:56.72]And store-bought burritos are just not the same.

[48:07.42]Burrito Perfect.

[48:14.58]Then fold one, two, three, and you get a perfect burrito with ease.
[48:18.68]I don't know if this will work.
[48:19.55]Now you can make quick and simple breakfast burritos, steak fajita burritos, chicken and cheese burritos, bean burritos, vegetable burritos.
[48:27.25]But what if you- okay, I use- I always overfill.
[48:31.47]What the fuck?
[48:32.56]Hold on.
[48:33.42]Huh?
[48:33.74]There's nothing in there.
[48:35.18]There's nothing in there.
[48:36.90]There's nothing in there.
[48:37.71]There's nothing in here.
[48:48.93]That's just a tortilla.
[48:49.65]Yeah, but, okay, okay, listen.
[48:51.03]When you make a burrito, I don't care who you are, I don't care what your food preferences are, I don't give a shit.
[49:14.11]You always put way too much in.
[49:16.31]Because you go, oh yeah, give me some ground beef.
[49:19.08]A little bit more.
[49:19.74]I think I'm a little bit kind of hungry.
[49:21.70]And the ground beef is like a mound this high.
[49:24.94]I want like shredded lettuce in this.
[49:26.14]Like shredded lettuce, shredded lettuce, shredded lettuce.
[49:28.88]Tomato, like tomato chunks, tomato chunks.
[49:30.52]A little bit of salsa.
[49:31.56]Oh, is there enough room for cheese in here?
[49:35.44]Yeah, I'll put cheese on it too.
[49:36.72]Like, a lot.
[49:37.30]I want a lot of cheese on this.
[49:39.34]And then you go, this is not rolling.
[49:40.50]This is never going to roll.
[49:41.66]I'm never going to have this be a burrito.
[49:42.97]So I'm just going to put my hands underneath it and, like, kind of cup it.
[49:46.07]And eat it like a folded pizza slice.
[49:49.51]So this product would never work for me.
[49:52.15]Ever.
[49:53.35]Because there's not enough in here.
[49:54.65]There's not enough.
[49:58.85]This is not a substantial burrito for me.
[50:02.33]Like a taco.
[50:02.83]Yeah, like fold it up and eat it like a soft taco.
[50:08.65]Kids might have fun with this though, right?
[50:10.21]If you use this for, because look, a kid's not gonna, oh hey, roll a burrito, son, that's four years old.
[50:15.81]They're gonna be like, I hate you.
[50:22.16]And they're gonna start fucking crying and it's gonna be a disaster.

[51:36.76]Alright, perfect brownie is an automatic absolute buy for me.
[51:41.16]Because you get edges.
[51:43.42]It gives you edges.
[51:46.89]You'll see what I mean.
[51:47.43]Oh no.
[51:47.77]You're going to have to throw the pan away.
[51:49.71]That whole pan's got to go.
[52:04.84]Yeah, everything gets an edge.
[52:06.14]Yeah, come on.
[52:07.06]18 chocolatey brownies sliced all at once.
[52:09.64]The reason?
[52:10.41]The unique design and durable non-stick coating.

[52:16.21]And look, the bottom and sides separate.

[52:35.14]It looks so fucked up.
[52:43.66]No, a raccoon got in the house.
[52:46.62]So, I would throw the whole thing away.
[52:50.52]That's not like, oh, dad.
[52:52.36]Dad ate all the edges.
[52:54.60]That's an animal got in your house.
[52:57.30]And I don't know if this is probably not sanitary to eat this.
[53:00.60]Yep.
[53:00.88]Yeah, no, these are better.

[54:13.65]I just watch every single one of these.
[54:16.85]All right.
[54:17.05]Let's do the Chop Magic.
[54:22.07]And first of all, we got, first of all, this is important.
[54:24.37]We've got Mark Gill here, which is automatic, like this product.
[54:28.17]I'm interested already, already right off the bat.

[54:34.36]You got it.
[54:34.90]And it's safe too?
[54:59.54]Alright, so here's why the other thing where it was the big, like, Dark Souls wheel, like, weapon.
[55:05.56]Like, pushing that down with the blades and shit.
[55:08.64]This has safety in mind.
[55:11.90]You get it on the blade.
[55:12.94]You line it up.
[55:15.12]And you're not going to touch it.
[55:16.18]It's not going to... You'll... The little prongs up top.
[55:21.54]That's good.
[55:22.00]I like that.
[55:22.76]I like that a lot.
[55:23.74]Now make fresh egg salad.
[55:30.77]It needs to be pre-cut?
[55:31.57]Does it?
[55:31.77]What's wrong with that?
[55:32.85]I mean, they're all cubes, though, right?
[55:34.49]If you talk about, like, presentation-wise, everything is a ham cube.
[55:38.93]Everything.
[55:39.51]Everything is a ham cube.
[56:00.68]So, I mean, presentation-wise, maybe not.
[56:02.88]But practical?
[56:04.40]I think so.
[56:08.30]Somebody called me an infomercial centrist.
[56:13.23]You can say it sucks.
[56:16.69]Did you not hear me talk about the fucking microwave one?
[56:19.71]The one with the eggs?
[56:20.71]I was like, nah, I don't think so.
[56:23.69]What do you mean infomercial centrist?
[56:27.19]I'm being honest and being very thorough.
[56:29.87]I'm being very thorough.
[56:31.49]Yeah, but nobody, nobody, dishwashers, nobody uses dishwasher.
[56:35.80]I use my dishwasher.
[56:36.76]I've run my dishwasher because otherwise it'll get gross.
[56:39.96]I wash by hand.
[56:52.78]I don't like that idea of taking- Oh yeah, there's like a bunch of fucking like saucer and like mess on my plate.
[56:58.85]Just stick it in here and turn the water on.
[57:00.35]No.
[57:02.09]I don't like the dishwasher.
[57:02.89]I don't like it.
[57:04.68]And you know why also I don't like the dishwasher?
[57:07.48]all the people question marking me right now so you enjoy putting like your dishes in this thing and then like for like at least one to two fucking hours you hear it's fucking obnoxious it's obnoxious and it lasts for an hour an hour two fucking hours of this
[57:35.19]I can wash a whole fucking sink of dishes in 20 minutes.
[57:39.29]Dishwashers are just loud, annoying, they take way too long, a bunch of water.
[57:43.50]No, no, no, no.
[57:44.74]Sometimes I'll use it if I need to, you know, but no, never.
[57:48.78]Sounds like your dishwasher sucks.
[57:49.96]Your dishwasher's broken.
[57:51.28]What are you talking about?
[57:56.03]Your dishwasher's fucked up.
[58:03.17]That's impossible.
[58:05.83]No, it's not.
[58:06.76]No, it's not possible.
[58:10.66]I don't use it.
[58:13.02]They're not that loud normally.
[58:14.32]I don't use this.
[58:15.48]How would this dishwasher be broken if I never use it?
[58:18.76]That's a huge amount of food.
[58:21.04]All right, cool.
[58:22.24]Chop magic is pretty cool.
[58:23.32]I like it.
[58:24.01]All right, what about the Go Grill?
[58:39.37]Yep.
[58:39.47]Holy shit.
[58:39.93]Can you imagine seeing somebody do this?
[58:59.01]You don't want to... Are you trying to load your backyard grill into the trunk of your car?
[59:09.80]Where are you taking this?
[59:11.44]Where are you taking this?
[59:13.07]And who wants to use them?
[59:14.97]But honestly, I, yeah, no.
[59:19.47]Wouldn't it be great to have a grill that goes anywhere with you?
[59:22.54]Well, now you do introducing the GoPro.
[59:25.96]Okay.
[59:26.38]Portable grill that travels anywhere.
[59:28.28]You go.
[59:29.08]This spacious grill has a five T-bone capacity.
[59:31.92]The grill is so compact.
[59:33.50]It folds all these sound effects.
[59:35.82]13 inches grill has a five.
[59:38.28]Okay.
[59:39.10]You know, your product is really kind of just boring.
[59:42.57]where you can't just show it.
[59:45.40]You have to have, like, lasers and whooshing sounds.
[59:53.18]Or, I gotta give the credit to the editor here.
[59:57.64]The person editing, I would love, god, if I could pick, like, a job, I think it'd be perfect.
[60:03.70]Sitting in the editing room and just kind of laughing to yourself and being like, yeah, I'm gonna put, yeah, I'm gonna put, like, whooshing sounds here.
[60:11.56]It's gonna be funny.
[60:13.62]I guarantee you they do that.
[60:14.92]There's no way they don't.
[60:16.75]That sounds like a fun thing to do.
[60:18.29]But only if they win.
[60:19.67]Why is this image so weird to me?
[60:20.91]Go to...
[60:41.64]This is a strange image for some reason.
[60:43.98]Why?
[60:44.22]I can't figure out... It's because they're all facing the same direction.
[60:52.65]Yeah.
[60:53.97]All of them are facing this way.
[60:56.79]And the water is the other way.
[61:00.03]And you can't put the cameras in the water.
[61:03.60]So this image just looks bizarre.
[61:07.64]Like, they don't want to go back to go where the water is?
[61:10.37]Is this, I don't know, this isn't a beach?
[61:12.57]Wait, what is this?
[61:14.55]He just said beach.
[61:19.75]I also feel like this guy is way far away from these two.
[61:24.66]Like, I feel like they did a weird camera thing with the, this guy is actually like 50 feet in front of them.
[61:32.77]Into the boat?
[61:33.54]Oh, I got a bite.
[61:34.84]Hey, hold on a second.
[61:36.18]I got four chicken breasts on a grill.
[61:39.52]Hold on.
[61:39.86]Oh, you went in the water?
[61:41.04]Oh, we're in a rowboat?
[61:42.22]Be careful.
[61:49.80]No, that doesn't work.
[61:50.54]We got man-sized portions.
[61:51.46]You know what I mean?
[61:52.32]Yeah, it's the whole rack.
[61:53.11]Which you'll eat.
[61:53.95]Maybe a third of it.
[62:17.42]And then be like, I don't really want any more of this.
[62:20.24]Man-sized portion.
[62:21.34]You throw it away.
[62:22.80]Man-sized though.
[62:23.70]Make sure that's for men.
[62:24.52]Okay, if I was at a barbecue and I walked up to the person that was like, you know, operating the grill, the grill master.
[62:45.90]I was like, oh yeah, I guess, are they ready?
[62:48.52]Yeah, oh yeah, they're ready.
[62:49.69]You want a man-sized portion?
[62:51.77]I'd be like, no.
[62:57.69]Are you sure?
[62:58.85]It's like four patties.
[63:00.22]Like, no, I don't want them.
[63:01.80]No, just can I have a regular one?
[63:03.96]Can I just have a regular hamburger?
[63:06.96]Just regular steak.
[63:07.92]Like, I don't want a man-sized portion.
[63:10.24]I don't thank you.
[63:10.72]What the fuck did you say?
[63:11.56]What a fuck-up.
[63:11.92]That's a major fuck-up.
[63:33.55]I thought those were drill bits.
[63:45.28]Okay.
[63:47.42]I will give a positive here.
[63:49.54]Here's the one positive.
[63:52.18]There are tons of portable grills.
[63:53.66]There are.
[63:54.00]There's tons of them.
[63:56.26]A portable grill is actually not a... It's actually pretty cool.
[64:01.43]I would actually rather cook...
[64:04.42]at my home on a portable grill than the huge, gigantic grill that needs a bunch of maintenance.
[64:16.10]So I would actually rather one of these than like a real huge grill.
[64:20.09]I don't know.
[64:20.41]That's just like a lot.
[64:22.03]I also don't like propane.
[64:23.83]It scares the shit out of me because it's just a fucking bunch of gas pressurized.
[64:27.15]You know how I feel about like pressurized gas and stuff.
[64:29.21]So I don't like using propane.
[64:31.21]I like charcoal and charcoal is a mess.
[64:35.71]Yeah, that one's cool.
[64:39.77]Okay, big top cupcake.
[64:42.90]Hmm.
[64:43.60]Perfect meatloaf.
[64:44.62]I'm very curious about perfect meatloaf.
[64:49.62]A flipjack pan.

[65:20.61]Perfect Meatloaf.
[65:25.70]No, I'm doing Big Top Cupcake.
[65:26.78]This one's frame rate is bad.
[65:34.66]We've got this other voice though.
[65:35.80]What the fuck?
[65:36.34]Okay.
[65:36.82]It's like 100p.
[65:37.16]This is a cake.
[65:37.64]It's just a cake though.
[66:00.51]No one's gonna eat all of it though
[66:25.92]I might, okay.
[66:27.58]It's, I know, but, no, no, they keep saying that.
[66:31.45]They keep saying that.
[66:36.47]Are they?
[66:36.91]I don't, I feel like they're not.
[66:39.87]It's a man-sized cupcake.
[66:44.27]Is a cupcake, is a cake that you can buy just at like the store, like the grocery store, that expensive?
[66:50.87]I thought that that was like a really good, cheap option, isn't it?
[66:55.35]I don't think they're cheap.
[66:56.17]They're not that expensive.
[66:58.21]They're like 10... They're like 15 bucks.
[67:04.66]Oh, it's a hundred dollars.
[67:06.78]Like, what?
[67:07.26]A hundred?
[67:09.14]Where are you buying these cakes?
[67:11.32]Yeah, they're like 10 to 20 dollars, aren't they?
[67:12.88]It's a man-sized cupcake.
[67:23.89]I love the sound effects.
[67:25.43]Where is it?
[67:26.11]Here it comes, right?
[67:26.93]Where is it?
[67:27.47]Where is it?
[67:27.87]There's like an explosion sound.
[67:28.79]There it is, okay.
[67:29.43]That's so stupid.
[67:56.11]That's so gross.
[67:57.61]I wouldn't want that.
[67:59.57]But you gotta remember like the kid factor, right?
[68:03.03]Kids, a big cupcake to a kid is, holy shit.
[68:07.99]This is a huge deal to a kid.
[68:10.40]So a lot of these are like for kids or for seniors.
[68:13.52]You gotta keep that in mind.
[68:17.20]All right, that was cool.
[68:18.02]What about a perfect meatloaf?
[68:19.22]I think chat's ready for this one.
[68:20.60]Holy shit.
[68:20.94]Did you... Why is there more than like two pizzas worth of grease here?
[68:24.37]What's going on?
[68:39.50]Hi, it's Mark with the perfect meatloaf pan.
[68:44.78]The new non-stick way to bake, lift, and serve delicious meatloaf.
[68:48.97]Watch.
[68:49.65]Just prepare your favorite loaf, place it on this tray, and pop it in the oven.
[68:53.79]When done, simply lift the handles and presto.
[68:57.15]Out comes the entire meatloaf all at once.
[68:59.86]The reason?
[69:00.60]The unique design and durable non-stick coating.
[69:03.28]We haven't gotten a technology.
[69:05.64]Other pans force your meal to sit in a bowl of fat.
[69:08.52]No, it doesn't do that.
[69:09.87]What?
[69:10.13]Okay, what kind of ground beef is this?
[69:12.61]This is not 80-20 ground beef.
[69:13.71]This is like 60-40 ground beef.
[69:22.92]with perfect meatloaf those same nasty fat drippings stay at the bottom of the pan and oh my god elevated lifting tray with over 60 drain holes fat drippings can drain through the holes and collect in the space below where they won't get reabsorbed back into the meatloaf lift and serve delicious french onion meatloaf savory stuffed italian or moist bacon cheeseburger perfectly intact all the extra fat meatloaf sucks
[69:51.92]Meatloaf sucks.
[69:53.71]It just does.
[69:55.27]There's only one meatloaf I've ever had that I liked, and it was my mother's meatloaf.
[70:01.37]Nobody else makes it this good.
[70:03.37]And I'll tell you, let's be really honest with each other here.
[70:06.28]I don't like your mother's meatloaf.
[70:08.98]I like my mother's meatloaf.
[70:11.36]Nobody likes another mother's meatloaf.
[70:15.70]I don't like your mother's meatloaf.
[70:18.02]I'm like, no, I don't like this.
[70:20.16]But if my mom makes it, it's like, mom, it's fantastic.
[70:24.59]Why is that?
[70:27.76]Yeah, your mother's meatloaf is the only good meatloaf.
[70:31.40]Even other mother's meatloaves are not good.
[70:32.92]I like that.
[70:33.64]Hold on a second, I need to...
[70:57.44]We gotta get, we gotta get that.

[75:04.21]I don't think it's supposed to be like a raging campfire.
[75:07.05]Alright, we saw this one already.
[75:11.96]Brownie Derby.
[75:13.68]Alright, Brownie Derby sounds pretty great.
[75:20.04]There's only one.
[75:24.96]What?
[75:25.54]Huh?
[75:26.28]Did you say a hat?
[75:27.96]That's right.
[75:28.96]A hat.
[75:30.00]Introducing the Brownie Derby.
[75:32.22]The incredible brownie bowl maker that looks like a hat.
[75:36.40]This, in my opinion, 100% what I believe was a different product.
[75:45.71]That somebody on the board was just like, can we fill it with brownie mix?
[75:53.13]I think so.
[75:54.93]This is... I don't... This seems like a bizarre product.
[75:59.63]But first of all... This is not a boring dessert.
[76:05.21]This is not enough for three kids.
[76:08.23]If there were three brownies on this plate, they would be cheering.
[76:15.27]Brownies are amazing.
[76:16.17]This is only one.
[76:16.97]What?
[76:18.21]Huh?
[76:19.55]Did you say a hat?
[76:21.23]That's right.
[76:22.21]A hat.
[76:25.67]Five nights at Freddy's thing.
[76:27.15]What the fuck?
[76:27.81]But who cares?
[76:28.83]Okay, but who cares?
[76:30.41]I mean, if you need something to cook a brownie in, then fine.
[76:34.43]That's fine.
[76:34.91]But it's not cool.
[76:56.99]Okay, but if you want a brownie that has a hole in it to put ice cream in it, then that makes sense.
[77:09.09]That's the only thing that they had.
[77:10.61]It's not like a fun toy.
[77:13.29]It's just a thing that has a hole.
[77:14.39]It's a brownie with a hole in it.
[77:15.27]Like this makes sense.
[77:24.45]But our man-sized brownie bowl Why did they The same shot Is it the same company?
[77:30.93]It probably is
[77:49.55]It's the same company.
[77:50.47]Probably has to be.
[77:51.31]Also, another thing that I have an issue with.
[77:53.97]They always show... I don't think this brownie was $80.
[77:56.19]Um...
[78:15.77]I would be surprised if this was, uh, it was just like a 80, like 50 to $80 brownie.
[78:21.40]Unless you're at like the fucking weed store.
[78:24.50]Is this an edible brownie?
[78:30.60]Well, dad, you sent in the wrong footage because that is $20 for it.
[78:36.02]I mean, that's not out of the ordinary, I don't think.
[78:39.57]And get two brownie derby dessert molds for just $10.
[78:42.47]We'll even include our fun fillings idea book free.
[78:46.87]Use the tips inside to create a colorful... The weed store.

[79:01.67]What year was this?
[79:02.31]This was probably like 2005.
[79:03.15]They knew it was coming.
[79:03.93]Oh, the tip the hat.
[79:04.55]I like that.
[79:05.17]That was a nice touch.

[91:10.36]This looks like a... It's plastic or something.
[91:34.19]A potato doesn't do that in the microwave.
[91:35.79]45 minutes?
[91:35.99]Did they fuck this up and does this person not understand that it's 45 minutes in the oven and not 45 minutes in the microwave?
[91:53.00]Whoa.
[91:53.16]Well, alright, what is that?
[91:54.26]What the fuck?
[92:20.98]The insulation steam pocket technology.
[92:22.84]Alright.
[92:23.16]This is high tech.
[92:24.50]Haha.
[92:39.45]Why are they putting it in an oven mitt?
[92:41.43]It's not an oven mitt.
[92:43.51]It's not an oven mitt.
[92:44.59]It's not an oven mitt.
[92:46.40]It's something... I'm telling you, there's something in there that makes it microwave safe.
[92:49.84]Sugar and... I don't know.
[92:50.42]What?
[93:10.65]Stop opening the oven when you're cooking food.
[93:12.93]Maybe that would help that, you know why it takes you 45 minutes to cook a potato?
[93:16.20]Because you go like this every fucking two minutes.
[93:19.52]Leave it alone.
[93:20.08]And they're just sitting- Did you just put three baked potatoes on the rack?
[93:30.54]Stop opening the oven.
[93:31.34]You're drunk.
[93:31.87]That's right.
[93:32.57]Just shit face.
[93:33.63]I own one of these.
[93:34.63]It's actually pretty good.
[93:35.67]Doesn't surprise me.
[93:36.55]Was that seasoning?
[93:37.57]So wait, you actually have this?
[93:39.07]Does it work?
[94:00.29]If it works, it works.
[94:00.97]That's why I don't want to look talking shit about these like commercials.
[94:04.47]Sure.
[94:04.75]Right.
[94:05.03]We can do that.
[94:06.23]But if they work as advertised and they're useful.
[94:12.53]Good.
[94:13.17]All right.
[94:13.95]It works.
[94:14.74]My friend has one of these.
[94:15.54]It works.
[94:15.88]It works.
[94:16.20]And then it works.
[94:17.40]Who cares?
[94:17.72]There's no problem.
[94:20.64]I am so ready for the Hulk grill because it's going to be a ton of man-sized portions.
[94:24.71]You've tried other grills on the market.
[94:26.39]Some of them may drain the grease, but don't cook the meat.
[94:29.17]Is that Hulk Hogan?
[94:31.05]Now you can enjoy juicy cooked burgers grilled to perfection.
[94:34.20]Grilled cheese sandwiches in 30 seconds.
[94:36.48]Homemade golden brown Belgian waffles in just minutes.
[94:39.68]Why was it?
[94:40.66]Why did they use Hulk Hogan?
[94:42.04]Is Hulk Hogan in the commercial?
[94:43.22]Hulk size.
[94:43.76]Oh my god!
[95:00.13]The Hulk Hogan?
[95:01.29]This is George Foreman.
[95:02.55]This is George Foreman grill.
[95:03.63]The Hulk Hogan grill?
[95:04.65]What?
[95:04.85]I thought he was gonna say 1,200 appliances.
[95:25.97]Okay, what is it?
[95:26.51]What is it?
[95:26.83]This is a fry?
[95:27.85]No, this is like a serving tray.
[95:29.43]1,200 appliances.
[95:31.01]And it's Hulk size, not even man size.
[95:33.61]What is he here?
[95:51.30]Why is he here?
[95:53.58]We better get, like, a 30-second monologue of him looking right in the camera.
[95:57.22]Let me tell you something, brother.
[95:58.40]The Hulk Hogan grill has got the healthiest... Yeah, please do it.
[96:02.53]Come on.
[96:15.30]You don't have Hulk Hogan on the thing if he doesn't say something monologue for 10 seconds.
[96:19.30]I thought that was Hulk Hogan for a second.
[96:21.18]Okay.
[96:36.48]You can easily cook swordfish on one side scallops and shrimp kabobs on the other close the grill and cook delicious Savory salmon grill large chicken breasts while keeping them plump and they shoot them eating half a hot dog in one bite And that's it grilled vegetables take the leftover chicken and a tortilla and you've got amazing fresh quesadillas Hulk Hogan's ultimate
[96:57.99]Where is he?
[96:58.51]He's not here!
[97:28.67]That's it?
[97:31.01]That's it?
[97:32.89]No way.
[97:34.55]What the fuck?
[97:35.83]He's just a gif in the corner.
[97:37.79]And they showed him biting into a hot dog.
[97:43.09]He didn't do anything.
[97:43.99]He didn't do anything but this.
[97:46.30]He just... He just bit into a hot dog.
[97:53.96]Maybe there's a 30-minute version?
[97:56.40]I hope there is, because holy shit, that's so funny.
[97:59.55]But even if this is the short version, you're not going to have Hulk Hogan doing anything besides bite a hot dog in your three-minute spot?
[98:09.67]Your three-minute spot has him biting a hot dog.
[98:13.25]You've got to have him being like, I'm telling you something, this is really good.
[98:16.57]It's very flavorful, very healthy.
[98:18.17]You've got to get him to talk.
[98:19.69]That's it?
[98:21.99]There's definitely got to be a 30-minute version.
[98:24.94]When you make merch for... Listen to me.
[98:29.14]When you make merch for your commercial, it's going to be a 30-minute spot.
[98:36.66]No way.
[98:37.12]This is three minutes.
[98:38.86]All right.
[98:43.50]How about the Fresh Mex Express?
[98:45.97]Yes, I do.
[98:47.55]Bring it on.
[98:53.00]David Jones?
[98:53.58]I don't know, I don't know if this is a new character.
[98:56.06]David Jones?
[98:56.68]I don't know, I don't like new characters, I don't like new things.
[99:24.53]Maybe we'll warm up to him.
[99:27.01]Easy.
[99:27.45]Take some avocados, onions, cilantro for a full bowl of guacamole in just five seconds.
[99:33.53]That was way more than five seconds.
[99:34.61]The secret is the three ultra-sharp stainless steel blades that chop, mix, and prep in just one step.
[99:39.80]Thick, medium, or finely chopped with Fresh Mex Express, the choice is yours.
[99:44.78]Make a spicy guacamole.

[99:48.58]Creamy chili cheese dip.
[99:50.26]Flavorful black bean dip.
[99:51.98]Even make fresh, healthy hummus.
[99:54.52]What the fuck?
[99:55.65]Nothing's better.
[99:57.25]I can't, man.
[99:58.73]This is fucking so dumb.
[100:00.31]Make cheesy steak fajitas, load up nachos, and more.
[100:03.97]That bulky food processor is a pain and takes forever to clean.
[100:07.53]But Fresh Mex Express chops, mixes, and serves in the same bowl.
[100:12.07]And it's dishwasher safe.
[100:13.72]Now get Fresh Mex Express, complete with our South of the Border recipe guide.

[100:39.56]It's like, oh, come on, man.
[100:41.58]You don't got anything else to put here?
[100:44.46]It's so fucking dumb.
[100:48.08]Free.

[101:10.85]If we do it to work with the kids.
[101:12.94]We found the Hulk one.
[101:13.88]Alright, hold on.
[101:20.36]Alright.
[101:22.18]I gotta go pee.

[108:04.14]Alright, where's the uh... Where's the link to the whole- okay, we got it in uh... what the mods gave to me.
[108:14.14]Is this the whole thing?
[108:14.80]Yup, 28 minutes.
[108:24.64]Oh, hell yeah.
[108:29.28]The following is a favor for the Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill.
[108:33.84]Oh, fuck yeah.
[108:37.87]Okay.
[108:39.13]Let me just move this.
[108:43.47]So this is the Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill.
[108:48.29]It's probably going to be in like 140p, just to let everybody know.
[108:54.66]Come back over here.
[108:55.36]We're not going to watch the whole thing.
[109:00.80]Maybe we will.
[109:01.80]Let's find out.
[109:04.18]You guys ready?
[109:06.50]The following is a- That was very loud.
[109:11.79]Paid advertisement for Hulk Hogan's Ultimate Grill.
[109:14.13]Brought to you by TriStar Products Incorporated.
[109:16.21]Alright, let's go.
[109:16.95]Hey guys, I'm Hulk Hogan.
[109:18.91]Stay with me for the next half hour.
[109:20.79]I'm gonna show you my latest invention.
[109:22.39]Hulk Hogan's Ultimate Grill.
[109:23.53]My invention.
[109:24.47]Brother.
[109:27.15]Finally, a grill that lives up to its name.
[109:29.75]Hulk Hogan's Ultimate Grill.
[109:31.56]It's the ultimate because its extra large interchangeable plates easily transforms your Hulk into a grill.
[109:35.90]You know, they definitely were just like, Hey, Hulk.
[109:39.72]Hulk Hogan.
[109:40.76]We're gonna run the camera for...
[109:44.12]Three minutes.
[109:45.53]And just do whatever you want.
[109:46.33]Do like three or four promos.
[109:48.95]You can literally say anything you want.
[109:50.01]Just kind of flex and shit.
[109:50.83]And we're just going to put you around the commercial.
[109:53.21]And then I think he's in person here.
[109:55.99]This is important.
[109:56.65]He made this.
[109:57.23]No, he did not.
[110:02.40]George Foreman did 10 years before this.
[110:06.42]You have evenly perfectly grilled food on both sides every time.
[110:10.08]Plus with its two huge cooking surfaces along with the dual variable heat settings from 210 to 425 degrees, you can easily cook healthy meals while excess fat drips away into the self-contained fat trapper.
[110:21.21]Just remove it, empty it, and put it in the dishwasher.
[110:24.09]The unique floating hinge allows the ultimate grill to adjust to the size of the food.
[110:27.74]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[110:28.54]Excuse me.
[110:29.70]Men don't like healthy things.
[110:31.08]We like chicken, cheese, bacon, and cheeseburgers.
[110:34.82]Grilled cheese sandwiches in just 30 seconds.
[110:37.10]Homemade golden brown Belgian waffles in just minutes.
[110:40.11]Delicious panini sandwiches in five minutes.
[110:42.59]Fresher frozen pizza baked in 15 minutes.
[110:45.15]Amazing quesadillas in only two minutes.
[110:47.79]Coffee.
[110:48.01]20 minutes?
[110:48.33]You stood from the back of the room and threw those pots into the sink.
[110:51.96]That's...
[111:09.82]Wait.
[111:09.96]A box of cereal?
[111:10.74]Who's putting a box of cereal down here?
[111:31.14]Why are you hiding this in like a safe down here?
[111:33.86]A box of cereal?
[111:34.86]Oh, the man who demanded the ultimate grill.
[111:36.02]Don't you dare talk over Hulk Hogan, right?
[111:37.94]Like, he's like...
[111:58.31]Well, let's get started, Bob.
[111:59.09]Don't you dare.
[111:59.83]Okay.
[112:00.93]Well, this is one of the most popular grills on the market.
[112:03.69]It cooks on a slant, and it may drain all the grease, but what are some of the other problems it may have?
[112:08.63]This grease is horrible here on the tray.
[112:10.63]What happens is, because this has no temperature control, and because it doesn't have... Wait, they're making it look like shit.
[112:15.74]The hamburgers are well done at the back, while they're still rare in the front, and it's a real problem to clean up.
[112:22.14]Now watch this.
[112:23.86]Oh, that's supposed to be the George Foreman.
[112:25.76]But we're going to put six burgers on there.
[112:27.73]Hey, guys, notice this.
[112:28.97]These aren't ordinary burgers.
[112:30.45]These are Hulk-sized burgers.
[112:32.25]These are for men.
[112:33.45]You know why I don't like these grills?
[112:35.03]Because I can't see it.
[112:52.40]I can't see with the food, but I need to kind of look at it, right?
[112:56.29]I feel like I want to see it.
[112:58.11]Oh, there's nothing on it!
[112:59.05]Ugh!
[113:11.22]It's just meat and fun!
[113:13.16]Oh, what the fuck?
[113:14.24]Look at how small that looks in his hands.
[113:15.90]This is tiny.
[113:17.12]This looks like a toy.
[113:18.18]Like, he actually has to, like, lean down and go, like, this is very small.
[113:21.20]I wouldn't consider this to be Hulk-sized.
[113:39.68]No, he just took out a third of the burger in one bite.
[113:42.28]That's not health-sized at all.
[113:46.25]Grill or ultimate grill.
[113:47.67]What about this panini sandwich maker?
[113:52.19]This is a professional panini maker we went out and bought.
[113:54.77]Cost $430.
[113:55.27]And it does a great job.
[113:56.79]What?
[113:56.95]Seriously.
[113:57.64]I think that was a genuine reaction.
[113:59.56]Because that's horseshit.
[114:00.20]You said weight.
[114:00.62]This thing looks like it weighs up.
[114:14.67]If even Hulk Hogan's having trouble with this, you know it must be very heavy.
[114:20.58]Take a look at those paninis.
[114:23.64]Those are huge.
[114:24.28]Now do you see how that indent line is there?
[114:26.22]That's the mechanical pressure and weight that we're able to put on with the ultimate grill.
[114:31.84]I want one of these shirts.
[114:33.30]I think those look better than those beautiful burgers.
[114:35.64]I want one of these shirts so bad.
[114:37.68]You know what I mean?
[114:39.60]Like the Hulk Hogan ultimate grill.
[114:41.68]I feel like it would be awesome.
[114:44.64]I want one of those.
[114:47.02]No, no, get rid of that.
[114:48.35]Pizza is my favorite.
[114:49.49]Really?
[114:50.01]Well, what we did is we went out and bought this pizza maker.
[114:52.87]It takes about 30 minutes.
[114:53.93]It's a little bit faster than heating up your whole oven, but it takes 30 minutes to make a pizza.
[114:59.32]Yeah, we got this pizza maker from some shitty infomercial.
[115:02.52]So take a look at our infomercial.
[115:04.58]Ours is better.
[115:05.10]I'm going to cut a piece because I want you to see.
[115:08.20]That looks hot.
[115:09.41]It is hot.
[115:10.01]Believe me, it is very hot.
[115:11.71]Hold on.
[115:12.29]Wait, wait.
[115:12.89]I feel like I missed something here.
[115:14.13]It takes 30 minutes to make a pizza.
[115:16.67]Take a look at that.
[115:19.07]Is that a pizza?
[115:20.45]What?
[115:20.69]That is a pizza.
[115:21.97]Now, I'm going to slide this off, and I'm going to cut a piece because I want you to see.
[115:25.94]That looks hot.
[115:26.88]It is hot.
[115:27.48]Believe me, it is very, very hot.
[115:32.26]Dude, what's with the pizza cutting?
[115:33.98]Holy shit, bro.
[115:36.46]Come on.
[115:37.00]What was that?
[115:38.40]Oh, that was.
[115:38.92]Isn't that great?
[115:40.62]Now, let me show you the bottom.
[115:41.63]God, it looks good.
[115:42.33]Look at this.
[115:43.70]Oh, it's grilled perfectly.
[115:45.06]Perfect, isn't it?
[115:47.03]He's like scratching it.
[115:48.95]He didn't even bite it.
[115:51.13]He didn't even bite it.
[115:51.95]Now, this is probably going to be too hot to eat, Hulk.
[115:55.29]This grill's amazing.
[115:56.31]I cannot believe how good the pizza looks.
[115:58.03]Just to get a smell and a feel of that.
[116:00.12]A smell?
[116:00.82]It's pizza.
[116:01.68]Now, let me show you the bottom.
[116:02.52]God, it looks good.
[116:03.36]Look at this.
[116:04.76]Oh, it's grilled perfectly.
[116:06.16]Perfect, isn't it?
[116:09.85]I actually think the one on the pizza maker looks a little better.
[116:11.89]In the morning, breakfast, without a doubt, is the most important meal in my family.
[116:15.58]I do the cooking in the morning.
[116:17.30]So one of the problems I have is sometimes the eggs aren't ready when the sausage is ready, the pancakes aren't done.
[116:22.50]It's a real pain for me.
[116:23.80]I have to figure out a way to make it all work at once.
[116:25.70]OK, well, that's because even though this griddle costs over $100,
[116:29.27]I mean, the problem is you didn't get Kathy Mitchell.
[116:30.81]Wait, did you just tell him to shut up?
[116:32.59]He was like, stop.
[116:33.13]That was an annoyed stop.
[116:50.38]I put a grill plate in here and a grill plate here.
[116:53.56]I've already grilled the sausage at about 350 degrees.
[116:56.60]I turned it down because I have the dual controls to just warm, about 200 degrees.
[117:01.04]I crank this up to 375 because now I'm ready to make pancakes.
[117:05.58]And now you can make your eggs to order.
[117:07.71]Let's throw some eggs on there, buddy.
[117:09.13]We can actually do a dozen eggs on here at a time if we want, or about eight pancakes.
[117:13.81]How about that for breakfast?
[117:15.21]That's great.
[117:15.75]That's unbelievable.
[117:18.43]but okay what's but a skillet is it's good it's fine I think it's very interesting god damn it you know one thing that I wish would ever ever happen to me in my life they used to do in infomercials these look at we're in a mall come try it and come check it out and be on tv
[117:39.53]God damn it, man.
[117:40.34]I wish.
[117:41.10]I wish.
[117:42.52]If I ever see this.
[117:44.10]Ever.
[117:44.96]I am running up to that fucking thing and being first in line.
[117:48.24]I want to be that.
[117:49.32]I want to be the weird guy that's just like, it's so fresh.
[117:52.94]It's delicious.
[117:54.36]Better than grandma makes.
[117:56.33]I want to do that so bad.
[117:58.15]Even if it sucks.
[118:00.57]I wish I could show you an infomercial where I was one of these people.
[118:05.74]you can do all this with the one one system because we have a waffle iron we have a little sandwich maker and then we make our pizzas in the regular oven so this is very good I like the idea of this compared to other grills it's a lot different variety of foods you can cook whereas the others are limited to certain things I'm a vegetarian and so it would be
[118:23.29]He's like putting his neck muscles up.
[118:26.91]It's just nice to be able to get something done for the whole family all at once instead of having to break it down into little pieces so everybody can sit down and eat at the same time.
[118:33.63]I'm too busy to talk.
[118:34.79]I'm eating the delicious food.
[118:37.89]Oh, that was a bum.
[118:38.41]I can't wait to get this for my dorm room.
[118:40.19]I can make, like, waffles in the morning and eggs.
[118:42.39]I envy this.
[118:43.57]Make some pizza.
[118:44.63]Go get some hot dogs.
[118:45.89]My room is going to be the life of every party.
[118:48.16]I'm a tall, big guy, and I definitely like eating burgers.
[118:51.42]Nice, large burgers.
[118:52.78]The executive.
[118:53.34]The grill is so perfect for that.
[118:55.16]Cookies, pizza.
[118:56.10]Perfect for the executive.
[118:56.94]Hot dogs, burgers, waffles.
[118:58.84]The best thing in the world.
[119:00.10]See?
[119:00.36]I wish.
[119:01.02]What's going on with the music here?
[119:02.80]I could finally hear them talking to each other.
[119:04.78]And I was like, oh, this is better somehow.
[119:07.33]Right?
[119:07.51]When this came back, wasn't it like, oh, cool, nice.
[119:09.49]They're talking to each other.
[119:22.33]As far as I know, there is nothing on the market that cooks frozen steaks.
[119:26.66]Are those frozen, buddy?
[119:28.36]Yeah, those are frozen.
[119:29.52]Okay, get them off there.
[119:30.98]Geez.
[119:31.48]Now, what we're going to do is we're going to unlock the back.
[119:34.21]These are frozen.
[119:35.47]We're going to unlock the back of the grill.
[119:37.31]Yeah, they are.
[119:37.91]Very frozen.
[119:38.63]Potatoes?
[119:39.07]Potatoes?
[119:39.31]Those aren't even the same shape.
[119:58.47]Party buffet.
[119:59.55]Okay.
[120:00.19]This grill sucks.
[120:00.99]No, I don't say that.
[120:02.41]I don't know.
[120:02.93]I don't know.
[120:17.66]I don't know.
[120:18.08]Okay.
[120:18.80]Open or closed, big or small, fresh or frozen, Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill truly does it all, brother.
[120:26.47]I can't wait to see this.
[120:27.67]But wait a minute.
[120:28.33]It hasn't done it all yet because I haven't even shown you your favorite thing, waffles.
[120:32.43]And I know you like Mexican food.
[120:34.11]How about quesadillas?
[120:35.35]What?
[120:35.57]When we come back.
[120:36.79]Oh, I'm on the edge of my seat right now.
[120:38.97]Some of them may drain the grease, but don't cook the meat evenly.
[120:42.02]And the cleanup is a mess.
[120:43.96]Introducing Hulk Hogan's Ultimate Grill.
[120:46.32]It's the ultimate because its extra large interchangeable plates easily transforms your Hulk Hogan grill into a skillet.
[120:52.79]Alright, we get it, we get it, we know, we get it.
[120:55.67]Show me the duo again, please.
[120:58.45]Like no other, Hulk Hogan's Ultimate Grill.
[121:02.23]Rubber.
[121:05.15]Hi, guys.
[121:05.57]Welcome back.
[121:06.73]Bob and I just showed you how my ultimate grill replaced over $1,200 worth of professional kitchen appliances.
[121:13.64]And we're not done yet.
[121:14.56]We can't do quesadillas.
[121:16.08]Well, remember just before we left, we put two 2 and 1 half inch frozen steaks in here along with a couple of potatoes.
[121:23.22]Let's see how they came out.
[121:24.20]Are you ready?
[121:25.08]boomer sensory video take a look at that well here's the deal with the frozen steaks yeah I've never seen or heard of anybody cooking frozen steaks together I'm totally perfect even cooked perfectly on the inside well let's just see what this is just the way you well you would just thought that is that juicy look at that now that's what I call it it's always about the juiciness of the steak right it's always like look at I'm gonna press and it's gonna juice is gonna come up at the same time
[121:54.40]They care more about how much water is coming out of the steak.
[121:57.68]I love grilled cheese sandwiches.
[121:59.96]I never get the center finished the same time the outer edges do, and I always make a mess, and I always burn them.
[122:06.51]Well, how about if I told you we were going to make these grilled cheese sandwiches, four of them, oversized, by the way, as you can see, in about 30 seconds, alright?
[122:14.31]Now, the way we're going to do that is we're going to use pressure.
[122:17.44]Give it a press.
[122:18.36]It locks in place.
[122:19.70]30 seconds.
[122:20.14]Are you counting?
[122:20.76]30 seconds.
[122:21.40]Alright, I'm... But a grilled cheese is like... A grilled cheese is very easy to make.
[122:28.69]It's very easy.
[122:32.19]What is he saying here?
[122:33.01]I can never get the center finished the same time the outer edges do.
[122:38.02]And I always make a mess.
[122:39.40]And I always burn them.
[122:41.12]But... I fucking love Hulk Hogan.
[122:44.85]How about if I told you we were going to make these grilled cheese sandwiches, four of them, oversized, by the way, as you can see, in about 30 seconds.
[122:51.39]Always, man, always.
[122:54.09]You burn it every time.
[122:55.78]I'm imagining this is like, oh, well, I want to make a grilled cheese sandwich.
[122:59.20]I burnt it again.
[123:00.10]I burn it every time.
[123:02.88]You turn the heat down.
[123:03.80]Give it a press.
[123:06.38]It locks in place.
[123:07.30]30 seconds.
[123:08.04]Are you counting?
[123:08.95]30 seconds.
[123:09.59]I'm getting ready to call you out on this one.
[123:12.31]Here we go.
[123:13.41]But we don't know how much.
[123:14.05]Wow.
[123:14.65]How about that, Hulk?
[123:15.85]Unbelievable.
[123:16.77]Now, that was 30 seconds.
[123:18.27]We've got molten cheese sandwiches inside and out.
[123:21.45]Molten.
[123:22.01]Now, the true test is if they're the same all the way through.
[123:25.14]Well, here we go.
[123:26.30]I get his point, though.
[123:27.36]Let it rip my pizza cutter because they're too hot for me to handle.
[123:31.42]And just take a look at that.
[123:33.88]How about that, Hulk?
[123:34.82]Let me see that.
[123:35.32]Let me have one of those.
[123:36.32]Now, careful.
[123:36.74]Don't burn yourself because they are hot, hot, hot, hot sandwiches right now.
[123:41.43]Mm-mm-mm.
[123:44.27]Instant replay.
[123:45.83]Just in case you want to see those grill marks.
[123:47.69]I wanted someone to explain to me here.
[123:53.77]What is the obsession with the grill marks?
[123:58.05]Oh, but look, it's got grill marks on it now.
[124:00.20]Who fucking cares?
[124:01.60]Who cares?
[124:03.92]Dude, it's a hot dog and it tastes exactly the same, but this time it's got grill marks on it.
[124:10.32]Okay.
[124:13.39]Who cares?
[124:14.37]Why is that such a huge, huge selling point?
[124:18.19]Yeah, somebody just said it's just a racing stripe.
[124:22.15]The grill marks on a real grill, it's like, okay, you're cooking on a fire or with propane or charcoal.
[124:30.96]Having just like a grate that makes marks on your food doesn't make it cooked on a grill.
[124:35.20]Like, it doesn't make it cooked on like a charcoal grill.
[124:37.40]It's like pretending.
[124:40.04]It adds texture.
[124:40.94]Not really, though.
[124:41.64]It adds swag.
[124:43.64]Oh, if only you had that canvas scooper.
[124:46.28]If only you had the canvas scooper, you'd be just fine.
[124:49.60]What was it called again?
[124:50.96]The hammock grabber?
[125:14.30]I love the instant replay.
[125:18.56]I love the Hulk Hogan ultimate grill.
[125:20.84]I cook shrimp and steak, and it's done quickly.
[125:23.80]There's enough for everybody.
[125:25.21]We take it to the beach, we take it to a cabin, and it's done quickly.
[125:30.93]He's not sure about this.
[125:32.13]Quickly, there's enough for everybody.
[125:37.17]All right.
[125:37.69]That's an application for this.
[126:02.24]having like it served but on low heat I could see that as kind of like a little party tray sister because does get cold I could see that this is this is an application for this and each other what kind of waffles do you like well not this kind
[126:23.62]This is too small.
[126:24.80]I like big, golden brown, perfect waffles.
[126:27.36]Fluffy and big.
[126:28.14]Well, this is a professional waffle maker.
[126:29.56]It costs $90.
[126:29.88]What's wrong with that?
[126:30.50]It doesn't do a great job of making waffles, but this is how much waffles it makes.
[126:34.24]So what we did with the Ultimate Grill, remember, we give you interchangeable plates.
[126:37.65]These are optional plates that you can also add to your Hulk Hogan grill.
[126:41.93]So all we do now is we swap out by pushing the button here and here.
[126:45.43]Oh, I fucking love Hulk Hogan.
[126:46.31]We swap out and cook in your waffle plates.
[126:49.79]Hulk Hogan is like a real Superman, by the way.
[126:55.16]Hold on, pause Andy, I know.
[126:56.54]The reason why I used to love wrestling is because Hulk Hogan was a real superhero.
[127:00.70]He was in real life.
[127:03.53]Like the Ultimate Warrior, Macho Man, these guys were superheroes.
[127:08.65]I saw Hulk Hogan not as a wrestler, but as like Captain America, essentially.
[127:15.07]I loved it.
[127:15.87]It was just like, wow, there he is, like a superhero.
[127:18.15]He fights for good.
[127:18.95]He was like Captain America.
[127:20.79]So that's one professional machine's worth, two professional machine's worth, three professional machine's worth.
[127:25.61]This grill got recalled.
[127:27.19]Wait a minute, you said that was a $90 machine?
[127:29.81]That was a $90 machine.
[127:30.81]We're going to do four.
[127:31.43]So we're making four wallops at the same time, so that's like having a $360 machine right here.
[127:35.81]Well, we're going to see how they come out, but they're going to look absolutely perfect.
[127:38.29]Give your machine a little love.
[127:39.77]Press it.
[127:40.19]Now we've got the pressure in there.
[127:41.55]We know that we're set at 375, top and bottom.
[127:43.00]They're going to come out perfect.
[127:45.06]He finally read it.
[127:47.18]Let's see how I was done with our waffle.
[127:49.18]Really?
[127:49.80]Beautiful.
[127:50.20]How about that?
[127:51.50]Now, is that an ordinary waffle?
[127:53.28]It's disappearing as one thing, but to actually see it.
[127:58.36]What's going on?
[127:58.86]Alright, how does it end?
[127:59.78]Yeah, remember the crispy pizza?
[128:01.44]I love that image.
[128:20.83]When you call, ask your operators how you can get the waffle.
[128:23.95]Little cookies like this.
[128:24.97]Oh, cookies.
[128:25.45]We're going to save this.
[128:26.47]Cookie baking machine.
[128:27.53]Now we can do little cookies like this.
[128:29.58]Those are huge cookies.
[128:30.58]No, that's a little cookie.
[128:31.74]In here, we got a hawk.
[128:35.10]Whoa.
[128:36.54]Nobody's going to.
[128:38.86]That's too big.
[128:39.66]That's just a pancake.
[128:42.24]I've bought cookies this size at the grocery store, and they're like $40.
[128:45.60]If I bought three or four or five cookies.
[128:47.42]That's a pancake.
[128:48.31]That would pay for my whole machine.
[128:49.49]That's crazy.
[128:49.81]There you go.
[128:52.32]Wait, did you say that buying three cookies at the grocery store?
[128:55.24]$40 cookie.
[128:55.50]What's with the cookie thing?
[128:56.74]Cookies?
[128:57.12]That looks pretty good.
[129:21.81]I bought a ton of quesadillas.
[129:24.71]Everybody participate.
[129:25.99]Everyone wants a cookie.
[129:27.43]Our family absolutely loves quesadillas.
[129:31.15]We're getting something good when we're eating at home.
[129:39.52]in the same house pizza and as a family of five the whole family can make pizza together and we can have dinner on the table in 15 minutes with fresh ingredients that I bought for a third of the price of pizza parlor pizza well I love to make it's big enough it's got a wide surface I can put two large paninis on there and it's done in like three minutes we cooked a whole
[130:04.19]Everybody lives in the same house.
[130:06.16]How big is this house?
[130:07.04]Sausage on there.
[130:07.96]We can make waffles, pancakes.
[130:10.61]Dude, I'm sorry.
[130:11.35]Only so many people can use the Hulk Hogan grill at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[130:16.35]I promise you guys, you're gonna be so happy with Hulk Hogan's Ultimate Grill, you're gonna use it each and every day.

[130:49.87]Hulk is gonna go wrestle this guy?
[130:55.33]He's gonna go kick the shit out of this guy.
[130:59.19]Yeah, like, is he saying that?
[131:06.89]Is he saying that to production?
[131:08.59]Like, guys, I'm gonna need help over here on the right.
[131:11.51]Like, he's not, he's talking to production.
[131:16.53]What an enjoyable experience that was.
[131:19.49]The ultimate grill.
[131:21.43]Hulk's ultimate grill.
[131:22.71]Alright, what's what I got?
[131:29.50]Oh, there's more.
[131:45.41]We were back here.
[131:46.43]All right.
[131:48.67]Perfect meatloaf.
[131:51.19]By the way, I hope everyone understands.
[131:55.95]I'm doing this more often.
[132:00.29]I'm doing this way more often.
[132:03.19]There's so many things to watch.
[132:04.37]There's so many products to watch.
[132:05.99]I was just testing it today to see if this was fun.
[132:09.48]Absolutely.
[132:11.87]We're doing this again.
[132:12.53]This is, like, amazing.
[132:13.88]This is so much fun.
[132:15.48]I love watching this stuff, and I'm so glad that I can share it with you, because I would lie in bed, put some of these on.
[132:22.32]I haven't seen any of these ones, but, I mean, maybe I have, maybe I haven't.
[132:26.32]But I would just sit there and, like, think these things, and want to just talk about it.
[132:32.94]So, yeah, we'll do this again.
[132:35.88]Okay, what about the Perfect Meatloaf Plus?
[132:37.92]We've seen Meatloaf before.
[132:42.78]Chef Tony.
[132:43.30]I- A baked potato on the inside?
[132:44.30]Add all more of this stuffed shit.
[132:46.62]You don't need- You don't stuff a meatloaf.
[133:11.43]Cool!
[133:11.99]What?
[133:12.19]That was real, you heard that.
[133:14.21]Did you guys hear that?
[133:14.91]Bold cuts.
[133:33.87]They use that same image.
[133:34.75]Aunt Nancy's meatloaf is an egg, spinach, cheese, and, like, bananas?
[133:37.95]Are these, like, plantains?
[134:02.58]What's in there?
[134:03.49]Alright, I'll eat that one.
[134:04.41]I'll eat that one.
[134:04.91]I'll eat the turkey one.
[134:06.23]You should try these and do reviews on them.
[134:32.38]I can already tell you all the reviews.
[134:34.91]I can already tell you that each one of these is gonna be like a mess, and I'm just gonna be like, I don't like this.
[134:41.67]Okay.
[134:43.19]The Pastafina.
[134:46.26]Pastafina.
[134:50.36]To make pasta on the stove, you boil, stir, and toil.
[134:53.66]And watch out, it's sure to make a mess.
[134:56.06]Then you strain.
[134:58.20]That first is trashed.
[135:00.06]And you strain.
[135:00.96]Make a mess.
[135:01.78]Then you strain.
[135:03.08]Why would you dump the whole thing out?
[135:05.98]It's balancing.
[135:07.62]It's balancing.
[135:09.99]On the edge of the sink.
[135:13.63]And you dump the whole thing into it?
[135:16.88]This person is trashed.
[135:18.86]Oh, they're, yeah, wicked high.
[135:21.56]And the thing is, what they should show is they should show, like, they should cut to the persons, like, over here.
[135:27.81]And just have them be, like, with these, like, red eyes.
[135:30.78]And have them just go.
[135:33.40]I don't care.
[135:34.72]And then reach into the sink and, like, put it back into the strainer and put it on a plate.
[135:38.95]Right?
[135:39.17]Because, I mean, come on.
[135:40.27]We've got some Chef Tonys in a row.
[135:48.51]in as little as three minutes.
[135:50.51]Simply add the pasta, pour in boiling water, and snap on the strainer lid.
[135:54.38]What?
[135:54.76]In no time, Pasta Fina cooks your pasta to perfection right before your eyes.
[135:59.10]Pasta Fina's unique vertical design surrounds the pasta and uses thermal control to maintain the ideal temperature for perfect cooking.
[136:06.17]Perfect pasta.
[136:06.81]Does this work?
[136:07.51]Just pop the top and drain.
[136:08.91]No lumps or clumps.
[136:10.29]Spaghetti.
[136:11.17]All right, hold on.
[136:12.19]Rigatoni, ravioli, macaroni, even tortellini.
[136:16.34]All in as little as three minutes?
[136:17.88]Without the mess.
[136:18.92]And pasta's just the start.
[136:20.70]If you like veggies...
[136:21.88]this is dumb fast and fresh does that work carrots asparagus even mixed vegetable medley and look we cook broccoli the old-fashioned way and the pastafini way look at the water there's all your flavor and your nutrients but not the pasta way look at the water oh yeah and look at
[136:41.34]What I mean, look at the water.
[136:42.64]But this actually looks kind of useful.
[136:44.40]Or to give us a gift.
[137:10.61]boiling water is annoying right let's just be let's be real boiling water is annoying it takes like a long time to boil water unless you get like a kettle and boil it and then you know what I mean it takes a while it's a this is a plastic tube I don't know it's obviously fake is it though you have to boil water for this
[137:37.13]Wait, what?
[137:39.31]Wait, it's not a... Wait a minute, hold on.
[137:41.21]You boil the water and then pour it in.
[137:42.89]No, wait, it's not a machine?
[137:48.20]You do pour in boiling water.
[137:53.16]Oh, I missed that.
[137:54.88]I thought this was like a device that you put the water in and put this in and in three minutes you got pasta.
[138:00.31]Okay.
[138:00.57]All right.
[138:00.79]I thought you like turned it on.
[138:02.19]Okay.
[138:02.61]All right.
[138:03.17]It's interesting, but I don't think that's going to work.
[138:05.25]All right.
[138:05.55]What about the fresh and crisp?
[138:21.07]Look at that spoiled produce.
[138:22.83]It just goes in the trash.
[138:24.19]That's like throwing money away.
[138:26.01]Introducing Fresh and Crisp, the extraordinary new freshness extender.
[138:29.73]Is it an air freshener for your fridge?
[138:30.89]Save your produce longer and save you money.
[138:33.30]Just look at the difference between 18 days in traditional storage and 18 days in storage.
[138:37.78]Hold on.
[138:38.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[138:39.62]Why isn't all this covered?
[138:46.56]You just open your fridge and just throw a head of open just lettuce and a pineapple and like strawberry, you don't cover it?
[138:53.33]Why- You need to put it like, you need to cover it and put it in like the humidifier thing.
[138:57.61]18 days.
[139:11.33]Okay, but what is the fresh and crisp what is it baking soda it's not
[139:37.28]Okay.
[139:37.76]Gas.
[139:38.14]Mm-hmm.
[139:38.68]Is it... Okay, but is it just... Is it baking soda?
[139:41.72]Baking soda in the fridge, like an open thing of baking soda, they sell them.
[139:44.92]It works.
[139:45.88]For like odor and freshness.
[140:03.95]it's proprietary hold on
[140:19.37]we'll also send you fresh in fridge the amazing fridge and freezer odor eliminated just place the fresh and fridge in any location in your refrigerator or freezer to remove odors and prevent odor cross but how long does it last laboratory tests prove fresh and fridge absorbs odors 97 more effectively than baking so hold on in fact you'd need an entire fridge full of baking soda to do the job of just one fresh and fresh oh out of here fresh and crisp produce savers and the in
[140:48.33]I'd like to see the science.
[140:50.13]I want to see the science.
[140:50.83]I'd like to see the science on that one.
[140:52.90]If it works cool, I'd like to know some of the science on that.
[140:55.08]How about the no spill chill?
[141:07.02]The only difference is this is not regular ice.
[141:26.32]This is like, this person, whether they're just high or they're drunk and they're just like, yo, man, I got an idea.
[141:31.06]Let's put Fruit Punch and, like, Kahlua in these and freeze.
[141:38.64]That'll be fucking awesome in, like, a few hours, dude.
[141:41.70]That's not enough ice.
[141:42.48]How many cubes is that?
[141:58.99]One, two, three.
[142:00.29]Not enough.
[142:00.81]It was bigger.
[142:01.21]Eh.
[142:01.39]That's really easy to fill up, though.
[142:02.83]That's very easy.
[142:03.59]Oh, no.
[142:20.49]Amazing the secret no spill chills flexible sleep expensive computer inside So they always how expensive is this computer and divided insert secure the cubes inside so they're not a single
[142:33.64]Oh, this expensive JPEG of a computer.
[142:36.64]I see.
[142:36.94]Alright, if this was two, if this was a double and it was a little longer, I'd probably be into it.
[142:42.27]I guess maybe you get a bunch.
[142:53.15]Yeah, I mean like a small fridge.
[143:11.40]for one second.
[143:12.36]What?
[143:12.50]What?
[143:26.42]Dude, you're gonna... This is ridiculous.
[143:27.60]That's not really stirring.
[143:28.80]It's kind of just moving around.
[143:29.96]Four hours?
[143:51.17]All right.
[143:51.69]I don't even have to say.
[144:14.01]I don't even know what to say.
[144:15.79]I mean, it's just... I guess it's like... Solves some kind of issue.
[144:19.24]How many pans do you have out?
[144:20.66]How much food are you making?
[144:21.28]You're making a lot of different things.
[144:41.02]All right, we got the Shogun Steamer.
[144:43.90]This is the urn.
[144:45.46]Did they just repurpose it?
[144:47.95]We already see this.
[144:49.29]Now you can enjoy all the flavors and healthy benefits of ancient cooking secrets right from your microwave in just minutes.
[144:55.95]It's the same fucking product.
[144:58.57]It's the modern version of this timeless classic.
[145:01.18]And it cooks meat, fish and vegetables, even frozen foods faster and better than a dozen pots and pans.
[145:07.02]Sound impossible?
[145:08.34]watch on the left boiling water on the right the shogun steamer we place fresh veggies in both and a few minutes later the vegetables are soggy but the shogun steamer done perfectly vitamins and color don't have a chance to boil away these fish fillets are frozen solid one goes in the oven the other in the steamer minutes later the oven fish is cold as a pop minutes later steamer filet is done to perfection minutes later did you stop it before it was done
[145:36.45]You can't put the same rules on two different cooking appliances.
[145:40.73]Hey, look, we put this frozen salmon in the oven for three minutes, and we put this frozen salmon in the Shogun streamer for three minutes, and look at the difference!
[145:49.54]You... You can't apply the same rules to different appliances.
[145:53.22]Is that what they're implying?
[145:55.18]No, it can't be, right?
[145:56.88]are frozen solid.
[145:58.16]One goes in the oven, the other in the steamer.
[146:00.62]Minutes later, the oven fish is cold as a popsicle, but the steamer filet is done to perfection.
[146:05.91]What?
[146:06.03]Simply add water, then choose the large or small basket depending on your meal, then pop it in the microwave and press, and the Shogun steamer does the rest.
[146:14.43]Is it magic?
[146:15.27]No.
[146:15.69]It's science.
[146:16.57]You see boiling... No.
[146:17.93]It's... Listen to this.
[146:19.65]All right, listen to the audio.
[146:20.90]Stop.
[146:21.56]Listen to the audio splice.
[146:23.26]Is it magic?
[146:24.02]No.
[146:26.34]no is it magic no it's the steam technology is it magic no listen to this the rest is it magic no it's no
[146:41.33]Is it magic?
[146:42.03]No.
[146:42.45]Steamer does the rest.
[146:43.99]Is it magic?
[146:44.83]No.
[146:45.25]It's science.
[146:46.14]You see, boiling water is hot.
[146:47.48]What was wrong there?
[146:48.20]But steam is hotter, so it cooks faster.
[146:50.08]Why did they need a doctor?
[146:50.80]Boiling washes away vitamins and flavor.
[146:52.50]Steaming locks them in.
[146:53.96]So your meals taste twice as good in half the time.
[146:57.01]And the twist and drain feature lets you save the broth.
[147:00.09]And it makes perfect pasta every time.
[147:01.95]It's the same thing.
[147:02.77]Enjoy a delicious seafood feast.
[147:04.41]We saw, we saw that already with the thing.
[147:05.57]With the drain at the bottom.
[147:06.27]All they did was change the name to the Shogun Steamer.
[147:07.83]And they added like a gong in the commercial.
[147:34.77]That's the only difference between the two commercials.
[147:38.09]What's the point of that?
[147:40.85]I don't get it.
[147:41.93]They're rebranded.
[147:43.83]You must agree it's the most time-saving, flavor-sealing cooking tool you've ever used or return it for a full refund.
[147:50.50]But keep as a free gift our handy cut-and-cup chopper.
[147:54.14]These are ridiculous.
[147:55.70]I love this.
[147:57.98]Okay, how about the Miracle Grill Mat?
[148:03.70]All right, we got Mark Gill here.
[148:04.72]First of all, it gets one full letter grade.
[148:07.52]Do you love the grill, but hate the messy cleanup?
[148:09.84]Me too.
[148:10.60]Hi, Mark Gill here for the Miracle Grill Mat.
[148:13.16]These green screens somewhere.
[148:16.88]Where is he?
[148:17.38]Oh, it's like a mat?
[148:18.40]Okay.
[148:18.72]Stop.
[148:18.92]And by the way, I don't know if anybody's household was like this or not, but like,
[148:47.76]I'm sorry, my, like, mother or father is not going to make, like, separate fucking breakfasts for six different people.
[148:57.08]Oh, you got your ham and pineapple for Jerry.
[148:59.37]You've got your cheese quesadilla and, uh, eggs over here for, uh, Sally.
[149:04.93]Oh, and then you got your French toast.
[149:06.15]Like, who the fuck is doing that?
[149:07.89]My mother's gonna, my mother's making, like, scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast.
[149:12.61]I'm not being like, mom, can I have pineapple and ham instead?
[149:17.15]Why?
[149:17.33]They always show making like eight breakfasts for eight different people.
[149:22.55]No, you're just going to get what mom or dad makes.
[149:26.73]That's not how this works.
[149:27.49]Mom, I want a ham steak today with pineapple.
[149:30.61]Okay.
[149:30.89]Okay.
[149:44.92]Nothing sticks.
[149:45.90]Are you kidding me?
[149:47.04]Whoa.
[149:47.16]Are you kidding me?
[149:48.52]Delicious, and I never have to clean my... Are you kidding me?
[149:52.36]Ooey, gooey, delicious, and I never have to clean my barbecue again.

[150:04.27]Restaurant quality.
[150:05.23]Restaurant quality shrimp.
[150:06.97]Restaurant quality steak.
[150:08.93]A steak is a steak.
[150:10.15]Let's just, we have to clear this up too.
[150:12.78]If you go buy like a ribeye somewhere, it's the same, it's a ribeye.
[150:20.42]Restaurant quality steak.
[150:22.70]It's just a ribeye.
[150:23.46]It's not like a special thing.
[150:26.56]It's just a ribeye.
[150:29.10]How's that wrong?
[150:29.68]Oh no, Mark.
[150:30.38]Mark.
[150:30.52]I can see this for like, yeah, vegetables and fish and stuff.
[150:33.48]That makes sense.
[150:55.19]ruin your meat and your hair what with the miracle grill mat there's never any flare-ups and bird dog sauces and marinades make for a cleaning nightmare but check this out with the miracle grill mat cleanup is a snap if you've ever tried to grill fish you know it just flakes and falls apart but I want grilled fish right now every time you've seen just some of what the miracle grill mat can do now get your very own miracle grill mat
[151:23.14]There's applications for it.
[151:24.30]I mean, you just use tinfoil, right?
[151:26.02]Yeah.
[151:30.81]Yeah, yeah, and then you just throw the tinfoil away.
[151:33.33]You have to, like, clean this thing.
[151:38.56]That's true.
[151:41.56]Alright, fresh toppers.
[151:46.92]Wait.
[152:02.98]you put it on top of an orange tomatoes the one on the left was stored in a plastic container the one on the right but it's it's open to the air isn't it plastic wrap that's a storage trap just fresh top them fresh toppers form a protective seal like your food's natural skin top on any fruit or vegetable top on cans and jars top on to see like okay jars I could do jars and fresh jars make sense odors in they're fda approved

[152:31.32]Canned stuff.
[152:31.78]What container can say that?
[152:33.56]Now it's easy to top fruits and vegetables with fresh toppers.
[152:37.07]I love my fresh toppers.
[152:38.11]Why do I feel like this would be kind of hard to get off?
[152:40.71]I feel like I'd have to like...
[152:43.05]Like peel, I feel like it'd be a pain in the ass to get off on some stuff.
[152:45.57]Why do they keep smelling?
[152:46.33]Stop sniffing it.
[152:46.75]They just get so, that's weird.
[152:48.11]I don't like that.
[152:48.71]How many do you get though?
[152:49.58]Because if you only get like four, you get four.
[152:51.00]Okay, let's preserve one half tomato.
[152:52.66]And like a lime.
[153:14.77]That's not enough.
[153:16.59]It's going to be double.
[153:18.96]It's going to be eight.
[153:20.44]It's going to be eight.
[153:24.44]Exactly what I told you before.
[153:26.54]Precisely what we talked about.
[153:28.26]Precisely.
[153:31.04]This is a different product.
[153:32.48]This is a knife set.
[153:34.36]This is also now what you have now, too.
[153:37.22]A completely different product.
[153:38.70]And more knives.
[153:39.40]Gotta get rid of some inventory.
[153:41.20]And knives.
[153:41.72]Oh my goodness.
[153:42.32]Okay.
[153:42.46]I still feel like there's kind of an odd, weird number of stuff.
[154:07.04]Alright, we're probably going to move away from kitchen appliances.
[154:10.42]I've got just tons to go through, don't worry.
[154:13.40]But there's other stuff too.
[154:15.28]There's other products that are not just in the kitchen.
[154:18.88]The Big Boss Sliceroo.
[154:24.19]Are you tired of spending all your time slicing and dicing and shredding and chopping?
[154:29.63]Tired of those other so-called slicers that can be dangerous?
[154:33.64]Well, say goodbye to all of that.
[154:36.02]Introducing Sliceroom.
[154:38.38]In seconds, you can slice onions, apples, potatoes, and cucumbers.
[154:43.17]Shredcast.
[154:47.50]They're fighting each other now.
[154:48.78]This is not the veggie... Wait a minute.
[154:49.90]Wait a minute.
[154:50.64]Is this the veggie roux?
[154:52.04]No.
[155:13.23]No, it's the Vegetti.
[155:16.33]I thought this was the Veggeroo.
[155:24.42]Okay, well, we already know that one.
[155:25.88]We don't need to see that one again.
[155:27.32]The Big Boss Sliceroo.

[159:03.89]It's an air fryer.
[159:04.58]Was this an air fryer before air fryers?
[159:05.74]Don't ever.
[159:06.04]No, who needs, like, fucking flavor?
[159:21.79]Now, I don't use any marinades.
[159:22.87]I don't use any fats, any oils, any butter.
[159:24.99]I don't season the meat either.
[159:26.03]I just put in a frozen chunk of chicken leg, and the machine just does the whole thing.
[159:31.19]I eat it, and it's dry as fuck, and it has no flavor.
[159:34.18]No fats and no oils.
[159:35.72]Get all that out of here.
[159:36.74]I want it to be like a dry-ass chicken.
[159:42.16]Wait.
[159:43.62]What's this end here?
[159:45.75]This ending.
[159:46.61]It just comes out wonderful.
[159:50.88]The push and prep.
[159:52.00]Oh, more cutting.
[159:53.62]It's a pain in the ass.
[159:55.22]Oh, you're gonna slice your fucking hand off.
[159:58.33]It's just a spawn.
[159:58.91]Oh, we're getting duplicates.
[159:59.89]These things do work, though.
[160:01.41]They just... I mean, there's a lot of them.
[160:22.49]Is it repost?
[160:23.79]I mean, I think it's a different company.
[160:25.51]Was this the 90s?
[160:26.31]I think most of these are early 2000s, mid-2000s.
[160:28.27]Pineapple?
[160:28.59]Yeah, we've seen this already.
[160:29.97]The best pot pie maker.
[160:30.61]Oh, yup.
[160:52.20]Let's go.
[160:53.10]Why is he on the phone?
[160:56.28]Wait, why did he call in?
[161:00.74]Why did Chef Tony call into the infomercial?
[161:03.22]It's like, was it like a radio?
[161:07.34]Was he like being interviewed on a radio station?
[161:10.08]Why is he calling in?

[161:27.06]He's gone.
[161:43.29]He's calling from prison.
[161:46.54]There's nothing better to make with holiday leftovers than my best pot pie.
[161:51.96]He's contractually obligated to finish the commercial.
[161:55.30]Do you love delicious mouth-watering hot pot pie?
[161:58.52]But store-bought pot pies have lots of potatoes.
[162:02.40]That's not fair.

[163:09.02]It can't just be a pot pie maker.
[163:11.22]It has to be, it has to make cakes.
[163:15.02]It can't just be a thing that makes pot pies.
[163:17.18]It has to, look, it can be a muffin maker too.
[163:20.50]It can be, I mean, it can make a pizza.
[163:23.06]Dude, it can make pizza.
[163:25.36]No, just, it's a pot pie maker, man.
[163:26.92]That's fine.

[167:24.86]It's an upside-down muffin tray.
[167:26.54]And put it into the oven.
[167:27.78]And there you go.
[167:47.54]The big crunch.
[167:48.48]I'd eat that.

[167:52.38]Good.
[167:53.16]Talk a bunch of shit.
[167:54.74]If you drizzled like mayo, mayo, mayo, mayo, I'd eat this.
[167:57.22]I would probably enjoy that.
[168:18.03]That actually, as long as the bacon was like cooked and it was actually crispy and good.
[168:22.29]It'd be like drizzle, drizzle, drizzle, drizzle, drizzle.
[168:26.14]Just a little bit of mayo.
[168:26.94]Just a small line of mayo.
[168:28.74]And I would eat it.
[168:30.76]I wouldn't be excited.
[168:32.94]But I would be like, that's good.

[168:36.36]So you can pour it out of your diet.
[168:38.56]Go from unsatisfying bacon bit snacks to hot crispy bacon bowl stuff to the max.
[168:44.62]Or make healthy egg white tortillas.
[168:46.18]He's a mayo addict.
[168:47.58]I'm not a mayo.
[168:48.33]Mayo is good.
[168:49.09]Stop.
[168:49.41]I'm itching my nose so much.
[168:50.73]We're moving on.
[168:51.53]Alright, we got the Easy Meatball.
[168:53.79]Easy Meatball.
[168:54.99]I feel like it's going to be... We've already seen one of these?
[169:01.53]What a mess.
[169:02.39]Lumpy and lopsided.
[169:06.69]They fall apart.
[169:07.47]Introducing...
[169:16.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[169:18.70]This is the guy that typically does all the voiceovers, but he's like talking like he's from New York.
[169:23.59]Is it the same guy?
[169:27.57]Wait, what is this thing?
[169:46.59]What?
[169:46.83]That's not gonna, that doesn't happen, right?
[169:48.99]Will this actually do this?
[169:50.75]I feel like it would just move around.
[170:09.17]Meatball hot dog?
[170:10.83]Oh, no, that was a meatball sub.
[170:12.91]Uh-oh.
[170:13.38]Okay.
[170:13.80]I can't see shit with only six pixels.
[170:16.52]Yeah, I couldn't really see that one.
[170:19.22]Onion bloom?
[170:19.98]I think we already know what this one's gonna be.
[170:36.05]These were so popular because of Outback.
[170:37.69]You just don't.
[170:38.19]You just don't.
[170:38.63]Well, this one's a lot more work than some of the other ones.
[170:55.48]and deep fry or bake until golden brown.
[170:57.94]Some of the other ones are you crush it with a thing.
[171:00.39]And serve with your favorite dips.
[171:02.11]Mmm, delicious.
[171:03.59]From the kitchen to the table in minutes.
[171:05.57]I think there are versions of this that are better.
[171:07.51]Amazing.
[171:09.01]The secret is the slicing guides that are specially designed to guide your knife for perfect slices every time.
[171:15.56]Even bloom this jumbo Vidalia onion.
[171:17.56]A must-have for parties.
[171:18.10]All right, but that's not the hard part.
[171:19.16]Slice white onion blooms for spicy salsa.
[171:21.34]I feel like this is the easy part.
[171:23.20]And like, deep frying the fucking thing is the annoying hard part.
[171:26.16]Like, this is the part that sucks.
[171:27.46]Like, the part jumping it in the oil sucks.
[171:29.40]And it's annoying and it takes a lot of work.
[171:31.02]Oh, I thought the onion was dishwasher.
[171:32.02]I was like, why would you put an onion in the dishwasher, dude?
[171:48.87]your own home with the onion bloom complete with pouring tool and gourmet okay all right uh muffin I know we don't need to see muffin top magic we already know what this is it's gonna be another one of those cupcakes was like look you can you can put filling in a cupcake you can put filling in a cupcake I'll just prove it to you
[172:13.07]Do you eat the muffin top but throw away the base?
[172:15.93]What?
[172:16.07]Have you tried so-called muffin top pans only to bake in an edible waste?
[172:21.05]Who's doing this?
[172:26.31]You throw the whole bottom away.
[172:28.86]Shit-faced, yeah.
[172:29.62]I'm interested.
[172:30.60]There's always an egg sandwich.
[172:47.64]Always an egg fucking sandwich egg sandwich egg sandwich egg sandwich every one of these makes egg sandwiches This fucking phone number is fake This number is not real What the fuck are you talking about?
[173:14.80]Maybe, oh, it might have been because the number didn't exist anymore.
[173:19.04]Maybe for, like, re-uploading it to, like, YouTube or something, because it probably doesn't exist anymore?
[173:23.93]They just made it a fake number?
[173:24.99]That would make sense.
[173:25.57]That would make sense.
[173:26.15]I get it.
[173:26.37]Yep.
[173:26.61]Yep.
[173:45.17]You need to use all these?
[173:46.27]That's a whole other ordeal.
[173:49.07]Maybe.
[173:49.31]And we're going to get two.
[173:50.62]Five, five, five.
[173:51.26]Five, five, five, five, five.
[173:52.18]Ooh, you get a spatula too.
[173:53.84]Also, how does that work?
[173:54.80]What's the idea behind that?
[173:56.00]If you call within the next 30 minutes, then you'll get this.
[174:16.78]Does that mean that like, okay, so if the first 500 callers, what if your caller number 502, 503, 501, 504?
[174:26.58]What happens?
[174:30.30]Can they say that?
[174:32.10]Because like the first 500 callers at the start of the airing of this commercial, right?
[174:39.85]Or like, oh, if you call in the next 30 minutes, the commercial is constantly airing somewhere, right?
[174:45.57]So if you have syndicated commercial that will play in every time zone, 30 to 40 minutes away from each other, it'll always be 30 minutes, right?
[174:53.45]Always.
[174:56.71]How does that work specifically?
[175:01.87]It's just a lie.
[175:03.86]It builds FOMO.
[175:05.94]I know it builds FOMO, but if your caller number, okay, let's say that if you were, okay, let's say I got 500 people that all were like, I want to buy this product.
[175:16.10]Like, okay, everyone call and buy the product.
[175:19.53]And then the 500 first person calls within the same like hour or two, right?
[175:23.95]And like the 500 first person's like, I want to buy it.
[175:27.83]If I can prove that this is caller number 501, what would happen?
[175:34.25]Everybody gets it.
[175:35.51]Everybody gets it.
[175:36.27]Yeah, I know.
[175:36.61]But like, what if you proved it?
[175:39.71]They don't care.
[175:40.43]They're not counting.
[175:41.51]You're just lying, though.
[175:43.09]500 people aren't actually going to call.
[175:44.77]You say that, but if you turn on like QVC or HSN or like home shopping networks, right?
[175:49.92]Like all those networks that existed.
[176:04.60]They would sell out during the presentation.
[176:10.74]They would sell out.
[176:11.80]They'd be like, okay, we only have the red ones left.
[176:14.69]People do this.
[176:15.67]People call.
[176:16.31]People do.
[176:18.81]Unless it's manufactured.
[176:20.13]But people would go on.
[176:21.31]I remember they'd be like, oh, we got this vacuum on QVC.
[176:24.13]And it'd be like in three colors.
[176:25.31]And the person would be like, oh, I'm getting word.
[176:28.13]We don't have any more blue vacuums left.
[176:30.03]And they'd have like a little sold out thing on it.
[176:32.38]Why would they say you can't buy it?
[176:38.76]Old people buy that.
[176:44.70]But why would they want to limit the amount of product they could sell?
[176:47.05]Alright, how's the- how's the mix and bake?
[176:53.67]Let me guess, it's gonna be silicone, and it's gonna be- there it is.
[177:05.69]What the f- Whoa!
[177:07.15]Actually, that was cool.
[177:07.95]Whoa, dude.
[177:08.39]Can it make an egg sandwich?
[177:09.95]I don't know if I want this unless I can make fucking poached eggs.
[177:11.81]That was cool.
[177:12.95]This is a cool thing, I think.
[177:38.21]Do some organization!
[177:39.09]Just take it all out and you can reorganize that in a minute.
[177:41.75]I like that though, that's pretty cool.
[177:43.49]BPA free!
[177:43.69]That cabinet is actually my house.
[178:12.71]These companies know a very, very important constant truth across all of us.
[178:19.90]And that constant truth is always this.
[178:22.80]You have in your place right now, in your home or your apartment, you have probably three or four randomly fucking sized random ass oven pans.
[178:34.40]that you don't know why you still have.
[178:37.74]You've had them for potentially fucking years.
[178:40.58]They're like, they look like shit.
[178:42.94]They're kind of like discolored and like kind of weird looking.
[178:46.62]And you have like four of them and they're just randomly sized and you just won't get rid of them.
[178:50.26]Ever.
[178:51.12]And you just use them.
[178:51.94]You just use them always.
[178:53.54]So they know that everybody has that.
[178:55.88]So they just tap into that by going, look, you don't, I know you have that cabinet full of those randomly like discolored, random sized pans.
[179:05.59]So just get this and you'll be fine.
[179:07.03]And then people like me, or like you, will do that.
[179:13.12]Because like, yeah, fuck man, I guess I do have, I do have like a baking tray that I've had since like 2003.
[179:19.48]And it's, you don't even know why you still have it.
[179:22.76]Why won't you just replace it?
[179:24.42]Replace it.
[179:24.98]Why?
[179:33.25]I won't do it.
[179:34.51]I should, but I'm not going to.
[179:36.45]I don't know why.
[179:36.91]Alright, what about the Brewstick?
[179:40.19]We all need that morning cup of joe, but brewing a whole pot is a waste.
[179:44.49]It's like pouring cash in the trash.
[179:46.85]Introducing Brewstick, the amazing new way to make delicious single-serve coffee in seconds.
[179:52.34]Watch.
[179:53.04]Just scoop the Brewstick into your favorite brand of coffee, lock it closed, and stir into a mug of hot water.
[179:58.54]Just stir it longer if you want it stronger.
[180:01.00]The secret is our exclusive micro-mesh that infuses coffee into hot water for rich, deep flavor.
[180:07.20]This is not gonna make coffee.
[180:09.67]What?
[180:10.01]Hold on, I'm biting my lip.
[180:26.82]Doesn't coffee need to pressurize through, like, through beans?
[180:29.63]Well, what they didn't tell them is we used toilet water for the left one.
[180:48.66]Mmm, very rich and full-bodied.
[180:50.56]Brewstick is dishwasher safe, so you can enjoy delicious coffee over and over again.
[180:55.82]Single-serve pods are expensive.
[180:57.70]Store-bought coffee at $2 a day adds up to $700.
[181:01.40]That wouldn't brew coffee, though, would it?
[181:03.18]Fresh, delicious single-serve coffee with Brewstick in red.
[181:06.90]It would be kind of flavored water, wouldn't it?
[181:09.42]Call now and double your offer.
[181:11.26]Get a second Brewstick in black.
[181:13.32]I mean, maybe if you left it in there for a long time.
[181:20.00]You wouldn't have to be in there for a long time.
[181:24.98]I mean, I get the idea, but I feel like it would take a lot longer than just simply going like this for one second.
[181:33.48]Alright, let's... Oh my god, time flies when you're having fun.
[181:43.17]I've been doing this for three hours.

[186:25.97]This lady's very mad.
[186:26.95]Are these even real cars?
[186:28.19]I mean, he's green screened in.
[186:29.50]But, I mean.
[186:52.46]more order today and you can get a second stream machine just pay a separate fee that's two stream machines and special pricing on our smart grid okay apparently these these this technology works back in the day back in like the mid-2000s this probably would have been a very good idea right the car valet the car cane what is the car cane
[187:18.82]Whoa!
[187:19.00]That actually is kind of...
[187:47.48]Whoa, don't get, get down from there.
[187:49.79]Get down from there.
[187:51.56]If you're having trouble like getting out of the car, don't go climb up there.
[187:55.48]What the fuck?
[187:56.52]If you are recovering from an injury or suffer from back pain, knee pain, or hip pain, you need the car cane.
[188:03.46]And when it's slippery outside, car cane gives you a handy grip so you won't slip.
[188:08.57]It's perfect for those tall SUVs or low compact cars too.
[188:12.69]So stop struggling and get up with ease.
[188:15.73]It was difficult to get out on my own.
[188:17.93]Now I carry my car cane and help myself.
[188:21.34]I mean, that's a pretty decent solution, I think.
[188:23.74]Yo, come on.
[188:24.02]Look at that.
[188:24.70]What?
[188:25.56]100,000 hours?
[188:45.77]I think that's helpful.
[188:46.51]That's useful.
[188:46.99]Oh, wow.
[188:47.13]Actually, I want this.
[188:47.99]That's... Okay.
[188:48.25]All right.
[188:48.63]This is helpful.
[188:49.11]That's pretty helpful.
[188:49.77]That's helpful.
[188:50.19]That's helpful.
[188:51.13]That's helpful.
[189:13.46]The extra view mirror, another one of these... Wait, what was in your rear view?
[189:22.35]But wait a minute... What was going on with this lady's mirror?
[189:24.65]I know what the fucking problem is, lady!
[189:26.49]Your mirror is turned all the way in, so you're only seeing your reflection driving the car!
[189:45.08]You need to put the mirror out and fan it out, lady.
[189:48.80]What are you doing?
[189:49.42]Oh, goodness.
[189:50.19]It's a widescreen.
[190:02.23]How much does it take up though?
[190:03.75]I feel like it'd be a lot of space.
[190:05.37]Wouldn't this get in the way of your actual vision?
[190:24.55]I am constantly adjusting my old mirror trying to get a view of the entire car with extra view I don't have to touch anything I can see the entire vehicle from window to window top to bottom with extra view you can see the entire three lanes turning around before
[190:40.56]after the difference is crystal clear and extra view makes night driving easy how to do that watch high beams and those new led headlights can really hurt your eyes at night but extra view reduces glare by up to 50 making night driving safer and more comfortable okay ordinary mirrors make you twist your neck to check and recheck but extra view lets you see it all
[191:01.60]Which is cool snaps on much more comfortable extra view quickly attaches to a regular mirror snapping on or off in seconds now when you're merging changing lanes and Backing up extra view makes it safer and easier to do is this somebody said is this legal for being on for road use?
[191:18.15]I'm gonna I think so
[191:19.99]Yeah, I don't know.
[191:21.21]Why would it be illegal?
[191:22.57]For what?

[210:57.26]You just made it a toy.

[213:36.09]That's a home run.
[213:38.89]That's an absolute home run.
[213:40.37]They probably have like 50 million sold.
[213:42.23]What an absolute home run.
[213:44.97]Alright, well... The Hydro Moose...
[213:51.69]Spray on grass seeds?
[213:53.51]Oh, that's boring.
[213:55.56]But hold on.
[213:59.83]Do the bidet, uh...
[214:03.10]He's like feeding chickens.
[214:04.18]What?
[214:04.34]Not anymore.
[214:04.86]Introducing the revolutionary Hydro Moose Liquid Lawn.
[214:29.08]Liquid lawn?
[214:30.84]The grass grows where you spray it.
[214:33.20]Start growing with ease.
[214:34.64]Whoa, that looks cool.
[214:37.18]Simply attach to any garden hose and turn the dial to seed.
[214:40.83]Hydromousse shows you exactly where you're planting.
[214:44.49]The green mousse formula contains an eco-friendly solution that attaches the seed to the soil and a conditioner to loosen hard dirt, allowing it to absorb water, resulting in a terrific looking lawn.
[214:56.04]We sprayed Hydro Moose on this vertical burlap wall and look, the seed locks in place even upside down.
[215:02.85]Does it grow on there?
[215:04.27]And the grass grows like crazy.
[215:07.81]That worked?
[215:08.48]This seems kind of cool.
[215:10.34]How much do you get though?
[215:11.40]That's the thing.
[215:12.90]Is that enough to do like a whole backyard or what?
[215:16.12]How much do you get?
[215:27.45]Um, that dog was fucking crazy by the way.
[215:29.57]That was like a six foot vertical leap.
[215:31.51]Holy shit.
[215:46.68]I just want to spray this, right?
[215:49.96]This is the thing that, like, dad would ask me if I wanted to help, like, with the lawn, and I'd be like, can I spray the seeds?
[215:55.58]Like, can I spray the seeds?
[215:57.88]And I'd be like, of course you can.
[216:00.78]And I'd be like, yes!
[216:01.60]It'd be fun to, like, spray the seeds.
[216:05.38]And then I would go back inside.
[216:10.78]Scour power?
[216:13.82]Smart shelf.
[216:15.04]Amazing grip.
[216:17.61]The shower wow?

[216:27.93]Shower now.
[216:30.74]shower wow what the shower wow the amazing new shower head that transforms water into a cascade of color ordinary this would be annoying which is why kids never want to get in but this would be annoying does it happen does it turn on every time you turn a faucet on through all the colors of the rainbow from orange and purple to blue and then green
[216:53.70]Your kids will be begging to get in and get clean.
[216:56.48]What?
[216:56.64]You don't turn that on.
[216:58.82]And replace it with our high quality shower.
[217:00.71]What was that?
[217:01.75]And you're done.
[217:02.65]Just like that.
[217:03.45]When you turn on the faucet.
[217:04.79]No.
[217:05.17]It's a cascade of color.
[217:06.73]No hardware and no batteries.
[217:08.45]No batteries?
[217:09.07]What are you talking about?
[217:10.41]Powered by water pressure for years of continuous use.
[217:13.69]And the high quality chrome finish goes.
[217:16.01]So you listen to me.
[217:18.50]You have to unscrew this off to make it stop.
[217:22.60]I wouldn't want this.
[217:27.78]That would be fucking annoying.
[217:33.38]That would be fucking irritating.
[217:37.72]That would pro- especially, like, in the morning.
[217:41.10]Like, I don't want to, like, turn it on and look at, like, a bright, like, blue fucking light.
[217:44.98]Like a, like, green light in my eyes.
[217:47.08]It'd be, like... No, that would be horrible.
[217:52.30]Air bead cushion?
[217:53.32]The wonder watch.
[217:55.73]The window vac?
[217:59.55]Alright, what's the window vac?
[218:04.31]How dirty are your windows?
[218:06.23]It's a big problem because dirty windows cloud your view and limit sunlight.
[218:10.41]Dirty windows are depressing.
[218:13.06]Dirty windows make your whole house look and feel filthy, but cleaning windows is the worst.
[218:18.68]The dripping, the big pile of paper towels, the hard work of scrubbing and scrubbing, and then there are still streaks and smudges ruining your window's appearance.
[218:28.35]You may have a dirty little secret.
[218:30.15]You don't clean your windows as often as you should.
[218:34.16]Okay, so what's the product?
[218:36.05]Wouldn't it be great if there was actually a vacuum to clean your windows for you?
[218:40.41]Introducing Window Vac.
[218:42.23]The fast and easy way to clean your windows leaving no streaks or spots.
[218:46.39]Just spray Window Vac and walk away.
[218:49.11]Your hands never need to get dirty.
[218:50.61]Okay.
[218:50.87]It's a squeegee?
[218:51.47]So it's a... So it's a little dirt devil.
[218:52.73]Don't they have those?
[218:53.41]It might just be a house flipper.
[218:54.99]House flipper?
[218:55.45]That would be kind of fun.
[219:20.87]And look, all the fat and grease.
[219:23.53]Just dump it down the drain.
[219:24.77]Except don't do that.
[219:26.69]Easy.
[219:27.51]Take a look at this window.
[219:28.87]It's filthy, right?
[219:30.09]But no match for window vac.
[219:31.80]Just one wipe and you're worry free.
[219:33.66]Alright, whatever.
[219:34.50]I'm done with this one.
[219:37.34]What about the Plumber's Hero?
[219:43.40]Hi, Mark Gill here with Plumber's Hero.
[219:45.54]The one product... Oh, not this thing.
[219:47.86]Just press...
[219:49.85]I feel like this would blow up my sink.
[219:51.65]I would be scared.
[219:52.79]Holy shit, dude.
[219:53.67]That's so much pressure.
[219:54.37]I would feel like I would do that and the sink would blow up my face.
[219:57.64]That's scary.
[219:58.42]That when combined with water uses that water as force to jet propel it through virtually
[220:17.95]Is that safe?
[220:18.65]Stop putting that... Ugh.
[220:19.77]Huh?
[220:19.91]Huh?
[220:47.14]Hair ties, toothpaste, shaving gel, and hair.
[220:50.64]Oh, even this old lady!
[220:52.34]This is crazy.
[221:11.72]Ah, shit.
[221:13.11]We were just about to go out.
[221:14.05]Ah, no.
[221:16.07]Wait, hold on.
[221:16.69]How do you tell me that, like, the fucking Mondo massive dump I just took before we leave the house?
[221:21.93]Ah, great.
[221:23.15]Now we can't go to the opera.
[221:26.05]Oh, now we can.
[221:26.87]Thank God.
[221:27.51]Did they have to make this sound so disgusting, too?
[221:43.33]The sound effects are like disgusting.
[221:48.13]Point and clean?
[221:51.99]I could do this all day.
[221:53.72]But I could do this all day.
[221:55.70]You guys want to do this like once a week?
[222:09.31]Let's actually do this like once a week.
[222:11.65]Let's do this until I'm sick of it.
[222:14.43]This is funny.
[222:15.05]I love this.
[222:17.24]Okay, we're going to do... I'm going to do the Ultra Bulb.
[222:18.96]And then I'm going to pee and we're going to... Uh-oh, your light bulb burned out again.
[222:23.92]They don't even make those old light bulbs anymore.
[222:26.90]And those odd-shaped LED bulbs shine a harsh light in just one... LEDs are amazing, aren't they?
[222:33.51]You need the new Ultra Bulb LED from Bell & Howell.
[222:37.37]It's the smarter light bulb.
[222:39.27]Ultra Bulb uses new LED technology.
[222:41.67]So it's an LED.
[222:43.23]Okay, so it's an LED.
[222:58.16]And how many?
[222:58.72]Okay.
[222:59.18]That's so bright, though.
[223:00.80]I don't want that bright.
[223:01.70]Technology.
[223:02.32]That would be too bright.
[223:13.45]Same LEDs do too.
[223:14.20]It's an LED.
[223:14.54]But not LEDs because it's an LED.
[223:15.64]LEDs last 10 years.
[223:16.24]But Ultra Bulb is always cool to the touch.
[223:18.50]It uses 85% less energy than your old light bulb.
[223:20.42]Just one Ultra Bulb can save you $100 over the life of the bulb.
[223:22.78]And Ultra Bulb turns on instantly.
[223:38.57]No waiting to warm up like those other bulbs.
[223:41.31]Why is this like the freezer room from like a 90s 7-Eleven?
[223:46.11]What are you talking about?
[223:47.54]What are they talking about?
[223:48.46]An ultra bulb turns on instantly.
[223:50.02]No waiting to warm up like those other bulbs.
[223:53.60]Is it Five Nights at Freddy's?
[223:55.02]What are you talking about?
[223:57.58]Now you can get two Bell and Howell ultra bulbs for just $19.99.
[224:02.80]Only two?
[224:03.86]No, it's going to be four.
[224:05.17]It's four, of course it is, yeah.
[224:08.35]This is probably 2004.
[224:09.01]That's true.
[224:09.33]That's true.
[224:09.73]Alright, one more.
[224:10.13]These are so addicting.
[224:10.77]I can't help it.
[224:11.11]What's the living bubble?
[224:11.67]Living bubble.
[224:30.82]Anyone can hang a picture to decorate a kid's wall.
[224:33.50]It takes almost no imagination at all.
[224:35.86]But when you have an open wall, what else can you do?
[224:38.48]How about trying something completely new?
[224:41.26]It's the Living Bubble.
[224:42.90]The clear acrylic semi-sphere globe that decorates any wall and provides a living space for your child to have their own pet.
[224:49.66]It's so simple, it's as easy as hanging a picture on a hook and gives your child's room a more decorative look.
[224:55.58]The Living Bubble makes any room come alive.
[224:58.31]Make it a fishbowl and watch their shock
[225:02.33]Huh?
[225:02.45]Plants?
[225:02.59]Oh, fucking no!

[225:43.69]I don't know.
[225:44.13]I think it's weird.
