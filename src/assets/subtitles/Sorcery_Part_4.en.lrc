[00:00.50]Thank you.
[01:37.33]Well, good evening.
[01:42.71]Good afternoon.
[01:43.73]Hi.
[01:46.54]My name's Jerma.
[01:48.28]What's your name?
[01:50.36]Oh, David.
[01:51.30]Hi, Dave.
[01:53.00]It's good to see you again.
[01:57.24]Let me just get a couple things straight away.
[01:59.42]I got new modem, new router, new everything.
[02:04.36]So hopefully, hopefully we can stream for more than like an hour and a half to two hours tonight.
[02:12.26]But I don't know.
[02:13.90]I did everything in my power.
[02:15.32]Let's hope it worked.
[02:18.50]Let me just make a tweet.
[02:25.90]Into the backlogs.
[02:34.23]http://www.twitch.tv/Jerma985.
[02:37.27]Alright.
[02:37.81]Okay.
[02:38.05]Whoa.
[03:02.65]streaming until he literally dies.
[03:06.75]Oh, boy, we got some subs.
[03:07.91]We got some subs that just gave it.
[03:10.97]MooCow50, thanks for the sub.
[03:13.85]PizzaPepper69, thanks for three months.
[03:17.14]CaptainNarwhal, thanks for nine months.
[03:19.30]JervisZap emote win.
[03:22.00]Game sucks.
[03:22.90]I need more emotes.
[03:24.98]I don't know if I can have more than one more.
[03:29.28]I'm not sure I have the subs required for it.
[03:31.89]I might.
[03:32.35]I have no idea.
[03:34.05]I'm such a bag of crap.
[03:37.71]But we're going to.
[03:40.27]We're going to do Sorcery Part 3.
[03:42.85]And when I say do Sorcery Part 3, I mean start it.
[03:45.85]Because it's huge and it's very long.
[03:50.75]But let's just give it a second.
[03:53.14]People can trickle the heck in.
[03:56.40]When was the last time you trickled in somewhere, you know?
[03:59.64]Thank you Lennox8 and thank you Lethal Spoon for 11 months and 7 months, respectively.
[04:08.86]Twitch Prime should give you a bunch of new subs.
[04:10.30]Yeah, that's true.
[04:11.64]I could probably look at it right now.
[04:17.11]But yeah, how was your guys' day?
[04:18.19]How was your guys' week?
[04:20.97]How was your weekend?
[04:24.67]Haunt Machine, thanks for subbing.
[04:26.15]Harry Poo Ray, thanks for subbing.
[04:27.88]And Louie Kablooey, thank you also for subbing.
[04:33.20]Oh, now I can see the Twitch Prime subs.
[04:36.80]Twitch alerts kind of put it into the mainframe.
[04:41.47]Robo Spike, I saw that one.
[04:42.67]Thanks a lot, dude.
[04:44.01]Thank you for your Prime subs.
[04:47.63]Well, we are starting soon.
[04:50.53]Ready to get zapped tonight?
[04:51.69]Yeah.
[04:53.81]I'm ready to get zapped.
[04:55.85]If you don't zap at least one person, I'm going to ban you from video games.
[04:59.84]Well, thank you, DarthButtCrust for 10 months and CoreMonster for 3 months.
[05:04.90]My week was freaking great.
[05:05.94]Didn't die, but I'm ill.
[05:07.14]Can you bless me?
[05:10.00]I just did.
[05:10.56]I just put my hand out and like just gave so much power towards your direction.
[05:15.78]Pastor Whiskey, thanks for something.
[05:20.31]And I think we can get started here.
[05:23.87]Let me switch it over.
[05:29.07]Let me switch it over to the nude cam.
[05:32.23]There it is.
[05:32.69]There's the nude cam.
[05:34.31]That's what I was looking for.
[05:39.52]Move this over here.
[05:42.26]Okay.
[05:43.32]So, part three.
[05:44.88]Source three.
[05:46.80]This is a complicated one.
[05:48.14]This is going to be real complicated.
[05:51.40]Let's briefly go over what happened in part one and part two to catch everybody up in case they don't know.
[05:56.95]The Crown of Kings has been stolen.
[05:59.84]I was on a quest to go get it.
[06:02.08]Zapped a few people along the way.
[06:04.76]Zapped, like, maybe four or five people, potentially.
[06:09.24]We made our way through the city port of traps, which was Karr.
[06:13.16]Karray.
[06:13.84]Karr.
[06:14.36]Karray.
[06:15.76]And now we're going to part three.
[06:17.02]Part three is the Baklans, which is, like, a big open field.
[06:21.44]Wait, what?
[06:22.62]I just remembered to lob that fucker down a well.
[06:26.32]Thanks, Paragon Chief.
[06:30.12]So, Nightfall's on this, the eighth day of your journey.
[06:32.40]The eighth day?
[06:35.14]Hasn't it only, it's been, it's been three days.

[06:45.46]Thank you, Salarox.
[06:46.71]Destroy him!
[06:49.63]What's the goal of this game?
[06:51.67]The goal of this game is to get the Crown of Kings.
[06:54.85]It was stolen.
[06:55.55]Holy shit, a bunch of Twitch Prime subs just came in.
[06:58.87]Destroy him!
[07:00.83]You're gonna get a lot of Paul Bearer.
[07:02.41]Oh, you're gonna get a lot of Paul Bearer.
[07:05.29]For the next, like, three straight minutes.
[07:13.14]Here comes another one.
[07:16.26]It's like three more.
[07:18.90]Oh, God.
[07:21.71]Oh, my God.
[07:22.61]Okay, I'm gonna... Paul Bearer is seriously going to do this for, like, a full three minutes.

[08:15.97]Okay.
[08:17.89]Alright.
[08:20.35]I might have to... That just freaked me out.
[08:23.71]I was expecting Paw Bear.
[08:27.34]If you're gonna stop, do it now.
[08:29.36]Get it out of this system.
[08:31.50]I got a lot of people to thank.
[08:38.13]It's never gonna stop.
[08:43.99]I promise we will eventually get to the back lens.
[08:52.77]It will happen.
[08:55.17]Eventually.
[09:00.92]Alright.
[09:05.82]I am, I'm listening.

[11:46.63]I'm ready.
[11:48.23]So, we moved on from part two.

[12:23.99]Oh, it mentions Flanker.
[12:25.05]This actually mentions Flanker.
[12:27.44]So, leaving the hills, you journeyed into Kare, a miserable place that you abandoned to the ravages of a goblin army.
[12:33.00]The wizard Lorag cursed you into revenge, becoming your god.
[12:37.81]You cleared the debt of Flanker, the assassin, and you braved the deadly portal traps of the city, ancient cruel magic designed to trap the unwary.
[12:45.63]The Parklands are different.
[12:48.75]Thank you, Core Monster.
[12:50.99]Listen to me, son!

[14:13.43]Hey, I started early.
[14:14.97]Guys, technically... Technically, we haven't even started yet.
[14:18.92]Because it's not even 7 o'clock.
[14:20.16]This is just like the pre-stream.
[14:22.74]See, this is pre-stream.
[14:23.86]Pre-stream.
[14:24.50]This ain't the real stream.
[14:25.70]This is pre-stream.
[14:34.81]Yeah, I technically don't even need to start streaming for like another nine minutes Quitter, Tinder, loser, what?
[14:43.54]Tinder's a really weird place It's very odd
[14:51.11]It felt too much like a game to me.
[14:53.37]Like it was a video game.
[14:54.41]Like left, right, left, left, left, left, left, right, left, right, ding!

[15:49.78]Thanks, guys.
[15:51.72]This is the pre-stream.
[15:55.47]This is like the pre-stream.

[16:06.19]Anonymous.
[16:06.87]What is anonymous?
[16:10.68]What?
[16:13.38]I think you guys broke Twitch alerts.
[16:16.10]Let's see if the next person didn't know.
[16:18.84]Why did it say anonymous?
[16:24.14]Pre-stream subs.
[16:26.73]Yeah, we got seven minutes before the stream starts.
[16:28.77]7 p.m.
[16:30.35]Eastern.

[18:37.70]Alright.
[18:39.20]Here we go.
[18:42.39]Hold the rest of your subs.
[18:44.97]Hold them.
[18:45.87]Don't spend them.
[18:48.21]We've got five minutes until the stream technically starts.
[18:53.10]Five minutes.
[18:53.60]But we're going to go.
[18:57.96]Huge thank you to all those people that think I deserve your Amazon Twitch sub.
[19:03.55]Thank you.
[19:04.81]So let's go.
[19:09.26]But the plains of Badubak will be different.
[19:15.66]Once long ago, this land thrived, prospering in the warm shadow of the fortress of sorcerers.
[19:21.89]High in the Zanzunu peaks, then something changed.
[19:24.99]They say the last refugee to reach Kari declared only.
[19:28.01]They're all gone.
[19:29.09]DESTROY HIM!
[19:35.03]The North Gate was sealed and the Bacchans left to die.

[19:53.45]That's what it's from.
[19:58.54]Alright.
[19:59.22]They are closed still and offer no return.
[20:00.94]You are alone in a cursed land, and you are cursed yourself.
[20:04.92]No one from the young country of the Analand has ever survived the wilderness before.
[20:09.28]You will be the first, or more likely you will die in the attempt.
[20:15.10]Ladies and gentlemen, Enkel presents... From Jerma's fucking basement.

[21:58.63]So like sometimes Lorag, if you pray to him, he'll be like, yeah, you're a fucking loser.
[22:02.27]But alright, I guess I'll like teleport you over.
[22:04.77]So I think he does actually help in some places.
[22:10.82]From what I think, what I think, you know, don't necessarily know.
[22:16.74]Alright.
[22:17.90]So let's go.
[22:19.46]We have one minute six.
[22:21.60]It's six fifty nine right now.
[22:24.64]7pm is the start.
[22:26.13]With our one stamina, three gold, zero rations character.
[22:34.19]Is this the moment the seven serpents are all four books turned into games?
[22:36.63]Yes.
[22:38.19]Yes, Tropus, every single sorcery book has at this point been converted into a game board.
[22:45.02]So you move the character around, you get your spell book.
[22:48.14]I want to make sure I show this to him because here's the whole spell book.
[22:50.58]Listen to me, son.
[22:54.00]I'm your dad.
[22:56.42]Destroy him!
[22:59.84]Whoa!
[23:01.41]That sounded like Paul Barrett was just singing to that song.
[23:05.21]Listen to me, son of your dad.
[23:08.47]7 p.m.
[23:11.43]That's time to start.
[23:13.48]It's time to go.
[23:15.12]We're going to the Baklans.
[23:17.58]Yeah, what's my death?
[23:19.22]What's the death counter at right now?
[23:23.00]I am Lorag.
[23:23.81]I speak for the dumps.
[23:26.35]I think we're at seven deaths.
[23:28.73]From my understanding.
[23:32.98]I didn't know this game included Paul Bearer voice lines.
[23:37.45]Alright.
[23:39.57]Here we go.
[23:40.05]Part three.
[23:40.71]Sorcery.
[23:41.50]Book three.
[23:43.64]Let's start into the box lines.
[23:46.38]The stones of the old road disappear under a layer of dust and sand at your back.
[23:53.18]We were supposed to start.
[23:55.92]We were supposed to start.
[23:57.52]We were supposed to start right there.
[23:59.76]Alright.
[24:01.21]No more subscriptions.
[24:03.35]I'm going to turn it off.
[24:04.67]I'll turn off the sound.
[24:06.75]I'll turn it off.
[24:12.31]At your back, flames flicker from the rooftops of the city port of Kare.
[24:15.57]Ahead, there is nothing but an empty waste and the night.
[24:19.98]So, yeah.
[24:20.88]Kare is on fire right now.
[24:21.98]We burnt to the ground.
[24:23.10]We let the... Why would I need a ready my sword right now?
[24:28.32]Let's just...
[24:32.58]Let's get ready my sword, you know?
[24:33.94]Why not?
[24:35.06]To trust this wilderness would be a grievous error.
[24:37.76]You draw your sword from its scabbard.
[24:39.64]There may be goblins still hiding out here.
[24:41.93]There may be somebody's dad.
[24:44.13]Somebody's dad might be out here.
[24:46.23]Waiting for the city to put a fall.
[24:48.41]That's right, sneers Lorag's voice in your mind.
[24:51.19]Prepare yourself for doom.
[24:54.34]He's in my head.
[24:55.34]Lorag is inside of my brain talking to me right now.
[24:58.04]Listen to me, son.
[25:00.54]I'm your dad.
[25:03.30]Yeah, I burned a whole city to the ground.
[25:05.39]Accidentally.
[25:06.79]But not really accidentally.
[25:08.59]I did because I felt like it, you know.
[25:11.63]So, you want me to argue with him?
[25:13.85]I could not save your city, Lorag.
[25:15.69]I'm sorry.
[25:16.41]As much as I wanted to.
[25:18.72]Paul Barry jumps out of a bush.
[25:23.06]I could not save your city, you protest.
[25:25.68]Indeed.
[25:26.86]You had neither the heart nor the stomach.
[25:29.46]You walk on in silence.
[25:32.58]Into the plains.
[25:36.88]Every step along the broken road takes you further from safety and into the unknown, and you keep your broadsword high.
[25:43.15]Something sets your senses tingling.
[25:44.79]You are not alone out here.
[25:46.71]Is that the screech of a bird you hear, or a distant scream?
[25:52.19]I can't, I have, no, I can't cast a spell.
[25:53.73]I have one stamina.
[25:57.10]One stamina.
[25:57.98]I'm gonna look around.
[26:02.66]Holy shit, that's a huge bird.
[26:06.99]There is definitely something moving, but you can see nothing.
[26:09.73]Then you look up.
[26:10.61]The stars are disappearing behind a rippling veil of shadow.
[26:12.71]There is a rush of wings.
[26:14.61]A moment later, a ferocious nighthawk is plunged from the sky, talons outstretched for your neck.
[26:22.29]I am going to PAX East this year.
[26:25.05]Duck.
[26:25.69]Roll aside duck or slash at the bird.
[26:36.79]I'm gonna duck.
[26:39.15]Duck.
[26:40.70]You duck, but the bird is swooping down.
[26:42.26]Its talons rake across your back.
[26:44.12]You feel blood sticking to your tunic and your skin.
[26:47.56]The bird wheels up into the sky to rejoin its group.
[26:50.10]You count four birds circling, ready to attack.
[26:54.86]Shout in defiance.
[26:59.73]Hey, fuck you!
[27:00.91]Try to take me!
[27:02.77]I'm your dad!
[27:03.73]You can't take me!
[27:04.57]Destroy!
[27:05.39]Destroy!
[27:09.05]Try to take... I'm screaming that at a fucking bird.
[27:13.05]Try to take me, you cry at the circling Nighthawks.
[27:15.17]I have destroyed a city.
[27:17.49]The birds wheel and scream, but they do not understand your words.
[27:20.99]Can I just cast something for free?
[27:23.53]I'm your dad.
[27:25.95]Destroy him!
[27:29.90]Alright, I have to mute Paul Bearer.
[27:32.54]Wait, what?
[27:34.18]It's too much.
[27:36.00]It's too fucking much.
[27:38.91]I can't go through the back lens while he's like screaming at my fucking ear.
[27:42.63]Jesus Christ.
[27:50.78]Sorry, Paul.
[27:53.62]It's been a good run.
[27:55.50]I'm gonna change the sub sound to like a burp.
[28:07.67]I'm gonna change the sub sound to like a fucking like screech like... Oh my fucking god.
[28:18.36]What the fuck is going on?
[28:25.30]Thank you.
[28:30.20]I haven't even casted a spell yet and some dude just gave me a hundred bucks.
[28:35.70]Oh this has been Paul Bearer screaming.
[28:38.89]Holy shit, dude.
[28:41.21]That's... Thank you.
[28:43.49]I don't know what to say.
[28:46.49]That's amazing.
[28:48.07]Thank you very much.
[28:49.17]It's completely and totally... I... Alright, thank you.
[28:56.19]I don't know what to say.
[28:57.91]Too much happening at the same time.
[29:00.23]I just want to do voices.
[29:04.12]Here comes another Paul Bearer.
[29:08.28]Jesus.
[29:12.73]Oh, my God.
[29:13.45]Alright, I'm gonna... Dear God.
[29:22.25]Alright.
[29:25.72]Let's... I, like, forgot what the fuck was even happening.
[29:32.64]Oh, yeah, I screamed up at him.
[29:33.80]I said, try to take me.
[29:35.10]The birds, they can't speak English, though.
[29:42.14]Do I have I don't think I have any spells that are zero mana.
[29:45.71]Maybe I do Let's see what can I do here?
[29:53.09]I don't have a pebble I can't do explosions I can't even do zap Mud I don't have any sand What items do I even have I can do oh wait law
[30:10.81]Shit.
[30:11.11]Three stamina.
[30:11.83]I don't have... Wait, wait, wait.
[30:12.95]Hold on a second.
[30:14.51]Do I have any... Blimbleberry potions?
[30:17.39]If I have any potions, I'll be able to do this.
[30:21.04]No, I don't.
[30:22.78]I don't have any potions.
[30:24.56]Stupid birds.
[30:25.16]Can't even speak English.
[30:29.40]What the fuck?
[30:29.98]These birds can't even talk.
[30:35.68]Alright.
[30:37.60]I kind of have to fight.
[30:39.33]I might just die here.
[30:43.78]I seriously don't have anything I can do.
[30:46.38]Oh my god, Jesus fucking tap dancing.
[30:49.64]Fuck.
[30:53.12]What is this?

[31:02.62]Thank you bow mono.
[31:04.84]Thank you.
[31:06.36]This is the thank you stream apparently, I guess.
[31:12.40]That's another smoke of 100 billion bits.
[31:17.52]I seriously have no idea what to do or say here.
[31:21.41]Stream full time?
[31:23.37]God.
[31:25.07]I told you.
[31:28.40]I just made like... Okay, let's break down what just happened here.
[31:32.59]I just made like $300 in like 20 minutes.
[31:37.92]Paul Bearer was just screaming.
[31:40.16]I haven't even been able to do any voices.
[31:43.12]You guys are fucking unbelievably generous.
[31:45.30]I can't fucking believe it.
[31:46.99]Thank you.

[32:57.58]I think I might actually throw up.
[33:00.56]I'm gonna run.
[33:06.82]You turn and race away across the dirt, pursued by the calling, jeering birds.
[33:11.28]One swoops, talons spiking your shoulder, knocking you sprawling to the ground.
[33:17.23]I could play dead.
[33:17.67]I could play dead here.
[33:19.91]I'm your dad!
[33:26.12]alright from here I I I'm going to I'm gonna I'm gonna mute I'm gonna mute for the time being because I I I have to I have to play we're on twitch.tv I have to play a game on Twitch right I have to play this game so we're gonna just go thank you for the subs thank you everybody
[33:47.78]Here we go.
[33:49.60]I'm going to have to check back and see how many people are subscribing later.
[33:53.42]And all these bits and shit.
[33:55.00]This is just too much for my brain to handle.
[33:58.07]So, huge shout out to everybody.
[34:02.23]I'm going to play dead so the bird doesn't fucking kill me.
[34:06.01]There we go.
[34:06.85]Play dead.
[34:08.79]So these birds are attacking.
[34:10.91]You stay down, hoping the bird will leave you for dead.
[34:14.70]But Nighthawks do not attack for pleasure, but for food.
[34:18.27]Lying still makes them bold, and soon all three are diving for you.
[34:23.39]Then quite suddenly, the Nighthawks break formation.
[34:26.15]Something else is shimmering into visibility in their very midst.
[34:32.49]Huh.
[34:33.93]Alright, so they want to eat me, but I'm like playing dead, so there's like three of them now that are coming at me.
[34:42.03]So I can get up and run away, or I can just crawl and watch.
[34:46.83]Well, at that point, I'm not playing dead, am I?
[34:50.06]I'm not going to... Think about it.
[34:51.86]Am I dead?
[34:52.88]No.
[34:53.22]They're going to realize that I'm playing dead and fucking come after me.
[34:59.89]Let's just crawl.
[35:01.07]I'm crawling away.
[35:02.21]I wonder if this is stupid enough.
[35:06.15]You belly crawl up to higher ground while behind you the strangest of battles ensues.
[35:10.91]The wing of one Nighthawk snaps upwards like a broken branch.
[35:14.25]A second is ripped into feathers by invisible claws.
[35:18.30]The remaining birds scatter.
[35:20.36]There is nothing left but your mysterious savior.
[35:24.28]So somebody... Somebody like helped me?
[35:29.35]Some random invisible bird?
[35:32.63]I have a feeling I shouldn't like call out and say anything.
[35:36.73]Threaten it.
[35:38.15]Hey, thanks for helping me, but fuck you.
[35:39.88]I'm gonna say thanks.
[35:45.36]Hey, thanks.
[35:47.30]You step forward and call out your thanks to the invisible creature.
[35:50.36]There's a rush of air just in front of you.
[35:53.10]Whatever it has landed, you hear the movement of unseen feathered wings.
[35:59.59]Can't you tell what it is?
[36:01.11]Lorag sneers in your mind.
[36:02.55]It is one of yours, a gold-crest eagle from Analand.
[36:08.00]Threaten it.
[36:14.24]So, I like how Lorag is just kind of my mind's eye at this point.
[36:20.93]He's just out here like, oh yeah, let me just tell you all these secrets.
[36:26.61]I'm going to stand back and see what it does.
[36:30.65]You step back and watch it, the creature slowly becoming visible, sees you have recognized it, it tilts its beak.
[36:38.55]I'm gonna give it a nice bow.
[36:40.95]You bow your head to the eagle, it opens its beak in reply and something falls to the ground.
[36:45.90]It is a message cylinder, whatever it contains must be of vital importance, or the king would not have risked revealing your location like this to deliver it.
[36:56.28]Shock him.
[36:59.98]Uh, I'll take the tube.
[37:02.84]You reach down and pick up the tube.
[37:04.28]Inside are ten gold pieces and a rolled parchment, sealed with the royal seal of the king of Analand.
[37:10.97]Oh boy, this guy's handwriting kind of sucks.
[37:15.07]We trust these tidings reach you in fair health, but must warn you of impending peril.
[37:20.45]Your mission is discovered.
[37:22.71]The Mangpang's eyes have spied our plan, and word is on its way to the Dark Fortress.
[37:28.76]Too late, we discovered our unwelcome eavesdroppers, and news of your quest is being carried towards High Xamen by seven serpents, the Archmages' most trusted servants.
[37:39.80]By now, they will have reached the Backlands, and here they will divide to complete their journey separately.
[37:46.06]If you are still able, seek them out, for they must stop to rest and eat.
[37:51.43]Destroy the creatures, destroy them before they reach their goal, else the Archmage will prepare a deadly welcome for you.
[37:59.13]Find Shadrock the Hermit for advice.
[38:02.11]for not moves through the backlands without his knowledge our hearts are with you kisses and hugs I hope you like camp love dad thank the eagle uh lots of serpents is this stream 21 plus no it's uh 31 plus you gotta be 31.
[38:33.43]Look, I just looked over and saw the fucking 500,000 bits.
[38:39.96]Thanks, dude.
[38:40.50]Thank you, Ofus.
[38:44.18]This is insanity.
[38:47.32]I looked down and I saw that there was like a bunch more subs, too.
[38:50.66]Holy shit.
[38:53.41]So I'm going to thank the eagle.
[38:55.01]You look up, but the Goldcrest Eagle has already rendered itself invisible once more.
[38:58.72]You feel the rush of air as its great wings lift it from the ground.
[39:02.82]Then you are alone.
[39:07.28]Should I just like burn this?
[39:08.62]Is this like Mission Impossible?
[39:11.79]Should I?
[39:15.23]Okay.
[39:17.87]Okay, that's... That's like...
[39:23.09]This is fucking another ten thousand hundred thousand dollars This dude is waffling, holy shit man.
[39:31.25]You're gonna pay my you're gonna pay my mortgage Jesus, thank you My lord I'm gonna I'm gonna keep it no I
[39:48.89]I'm gonna destroy it because I'm the only one that needs to know this.
[39:52.55]Somebody kidnaps me, if I get like grabbed and caught, somebody sees this message, they're gonna freak out.
[39:56.98]They're gonna be like, oh, the king sent you.
[39:58.40]No, destroy the fucking message.
[40:00.46]You tear the node into shreds and toss them to the wind.
[40:03.14]What?
[40:04.28]That's the worst way to do that.
[40:05.24]Don't you know like identity thieves can just like piece, like take masking tape and kick, what?
[40:10.43]That's terrible.
[40:10.95]I should have shredded the damn thing or burnt it.
[40:13.17]Where's my hot spell?
[40:16.48]You will not quickly forget what it said.
[40:18.22]It would seem the Backlands are not as deserted as you had supposed.
[40:21.74]You must find these seven serpents and destroy them, or your journey will be for nothing.
[40:27.14]So the Archmage found out I was coming for his crown, and I guess decided to send his seven serpents after me?
[40:38.73]No decision is permanent.
[40:39.77]Click the rewind button at any time if you want to scroll back and try a different path.
[40:43.91]No.
[40:45.75]No, there's no rewinds.
[40:46.97]Sorry, game.
[40:47.79]As much as you want me to.
[40:48.53]What are you going to get me for our one-year anniversary with all that dosh?
[40:54.70]I'm going to buy a... I'm going to buy two or three king-size Kit Kat bars.
[41:02.50]No rewinds.
[41:03.24]Let's keep going.
[41:08.10]100 billion bits.
[41:09.36]Damn, dude.
[41:12.64]The stars turn on the sky overhead.
[41:14.98]Taking the pole as your guide, you rejoin the old road and make your way north.
[41:19.20]Before you, the baklans stretch away to a dim horizon.
[41:22.78]How can you hope to locate seven serpents in such a wilderness?
[41:26.38]Lorag chuckles in your mind.
[41:28.48]Afraid, he asks.
[41:30.10]You should be.
[41:31.22]These lands are death.
[41:34.04]What do you know?
[41:36.09]What do you know?
[41:38.16]I can hear your thoughts.
[41:40.13]There is no need to speak.
[41:41.95]Know this.
[41:43.01]The Blacklands were rich and prosperous once.
[41:45.91]One man destroyed them.
[41:47.65]Much like Kari.
[41:49.28]Don't you agree?
[41:50.02]I'm not afraid.
[41:55.92]The Archmage was scared enough to destroy this whole land.
[41:59.58]And do you know what fear it was?
[42:02.14]It was his fear of you, Anor Lander.
[42:05.78]He foresaw your coming and destroyed the Backlands to better fashion a trap for you.
[42:10.57]Lorag chuckles savagely.
[42:12.99]But before you can question him further, his presence inside your mind fades away.
[42:17.73]Oh, he's gone.
[42:25.67]Let's go.
[42:30.71]At the cliff.
[42:34.14]After about half an hour, you see a deep black line across the Earth up ahead and catch your step just in time.
[42:40.10]You are one pace away from the edge of a sheer cliff.
[42:43.38]A few loose stones disappear over the edge and clatter away into the dark.
[42:47.77]Now then, sneers Lorag in your mind, how will you get past this one?
[42:52.51]Grow wings and fly?
[42:59.92]I wonder if I can float.
[43:00.70]That's... That's... Waffen, another time.
[43:07.10]Another hundred bits.
[43:08.28]Another hundred bits.
[43:10.30]Another hundred billion.
[43:14.52]Zap the cliff.
[43:20.55]That's like fucking... That's... Alright, I want to make this real clear.
[43:26.55]Thank you so much for this, dude, but this... Nobody... You don't have to give me that kind of money.
[43:32.92]Don't ever feel like you have to.
[43:35.42]You being here hanging out is enough.
[43:37.92]Oh shit, he's screaming again.
[43:40.12]Yeah, you guys just like being here is enough for me.
[43:44.23]So don't like think, don't feel like, oh, I better give this guy like 500 bucks.
[43:48.23]Like you don't have to.
[43:50.07]As much as like, that guy just gave me like a hundred thousand.
[43:54.60]But it's appreciated nonetheless.
[43:58.98]Much love.
[44:00.56]Much love.
[44:04.48]Well, I'm not going to sense danger because I'm on a bridge.
[44:07.44]Obviously.
[44:09.62]Like I can fall off the bridge.
[44:13.85]I can't cast anything one stamina.
[44:17.05]Can I, like, suck Lorag's Soul Dry and have him give me, like, five stamina?
[44:28.36]What would I cast?
[44:29.10]I could cast a Fireball.
[44:30.92]No, how?
[44:32.08]Yeah, I can't do anything until I get some stamina.
[44:37.80]Alright, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna rest until daylight.
[44:43.74]Drink him.
[44:44.79]I'm going to rest because I need stamina.
[44:46.61]I believe.
[44:47.25]Have I eaten?
[44:47.71]I don't even know if I've eaten.
[44:54.74]Rest.
[44:57.42]You shiver and pull your cloak about yourself.
[44:59.26]The hour is late enough already.
[45:01.84]You will rest here, though there is no shelter and continue in the light.
[45:07.18]Laying your pack down by the cliff edge, you try to settle despite the cold.
[45:10.64]At least you have eaten already today, so do not need to eat again to avoid hunger, though more food will make you stronger.
[45:17.33]So I guess yesterday technically was the end of part two, which I did eat at the end of part two, I guess.
[45:24.66]I guess.
[45:26.08]So close my eyes.
[45:27.94]I should get some more stamina here.
[45:32.39]You close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.
[45:34.95]The silence is loud in your ears.
[45:37.07]Slowly, you are understanding the true loneliness of this place.
[45:41.31]You long for human company, even the withering insults of Flanker, but there is no one here.
[45:48.45]Keeps reminding me that Flanker was a thing, right?
[45:52.80]His Swindle Stones is definitely going to reappear for sure.
[45:56.72]Sleep.
[45:57.76]Two stamina, that's it?
[45:59.88]The Long Night is filled with visions.
[46:02.16]A boy sits on a throne of skulls and swords, wearing a crown carved from solid bone.
[46:07.30]He seems not to notice you, but plays with carved model figurines of goblins, trolls, and demons, playing out a war, though he looks bored by it.
[46:16.00]A small rabbit hops to your feet, quite tame, then raises its eyes, which burn bright and terrible red, with the force of a red eye of Kari.
[46:25.82]And even while you sleep, you know the serpents are moving towards Mampang, and every day you spend out here is a day in which your journey might be discovered.
[46:35.18]We're gonna fund your new clown car.
[46:40.29]Day one.
[46:41.47]At the edge of a cliff.
[46:44.13]You have scraped by, gained considerable gold, and found two new clues.
[46:51.47]Wow, we got sound.
[46:52.63]Holy shit.
[46:54.53]Morning brings cold, clear light.
[46:56.59]You wake and find yourself lying all but on the edge of a great cliff that plunges to a rocky floor below.
[47:01.89]A good thing you did not roll in the night.
[47:05.87]A little look over the edge.
[47:08.99]You approach the cliff edge and peer over.
[47:10.79]The drop is considerable and the view beyond stretches for miles.
[47:14.27]Leading away to the left is what appears to be a carved staircase of rough stone blocks.
[47:19.09]In the far distance, birds wheel and turn above the landscape ahead.
[47:25.03]Look at the view.
[47:26.67]As you stare right across the plains, the featureless dust resolves itself into low, rocky outcrops and gullies.
[47:32.41]The landscape below is not as featureless as perhaps you first thought.
[47:37.08]Ding.
[47:39.48]You're supposed to stream at 7, not 638.
[47:40.96]I started early.
[47:42.92]It was an early start.
[47:48.34]uh let's back to the journey let's see time then to consider your journey from across the plane you hear the distant sound of flapping wings more nighthawks but nighthawks do not fly when the sun is shining maybe the eagle's still following me let's see look back
[48:04.53]Shielding your eyes against the low sun, you look south.
[48:07.00]The sky seemed darker there, somehow, and four birds wheel against the sky.
[48:11.42]Then suddenly they break formation.
[48:13.50]One falls.
[48:14.48]Another is torn to pieces.
[48:16.00]A figure moves in the darkness beneath.
[48:20.39]Let's see who it is.
[48:21.11]It's Flanker.
[48:22.31]Flanker's back.
[48:24.71]Watch this be Flanker.
[48:27.15]Everyone was so mad at me for getting rid of him.
[48:29.72]and he's gonna show up right now and be like I'm back I saved you from those slasher burns you try to make out more through the darkness but you though you recognize the figure you cannot place him what I'm going over there you rush a few steps forward but suddenly the whole scene is gone the planes and skies are empty once more there is something very strange about this place
[49:00.61]Destroy him!
[49:02.79]Whoa!
[49:04.03]We're gonna have to float in the air.
[49:10.31]That's the solution.
[49:11.31]Oh shit, there's a big fight going on.
[49:12.89]Might as well float in the air.
[49:17.81]I guess I could do that and just go over the bridge, right?
[49:19.59]Listen to me, son.
[49:23.85]I'm your dad.
[49:24.23]How come I'm not connected to this?
[49:25.41]There's no connection?
[49:26.13]Destroy him!
[49:29.73]Whoa!
[49:32.41]no I'm looking at the staircase you turn your attention to the steps down the cliffside they are carved from a living rock I'm your dad but your dad says destroy him what would do that so you turn your attention to the steps on the cliffside they are carved from the living rock and their surfaces perhaps once smooth are now warped and drilled with holes from the rain
[49:59.79]but they lead downwards all the same.
[50:02.53]How did anyone carve such a slope?
[50:04.03]What did they stand on to sculpt the stones so high up in the air?
[50:07.85]The top step is covered with a curious bright yellow moss.
[50:11.29]Sunlight sparkles in the distance, a lake perhaps.
[50:13.67]Let's get some of that fucking moss.
[50:19.02]You grab a fistful of the moss.
[50:20.16]It is juicy and extremely pungent.
[50:22.94]I can eat this shit, right?
[50:25.04]Didn't I already do this?
[50:25.98]This green moss?
[50:28.20]Just eat it.
[50:28.74]Taste it.
[50:30.41]You taste the moss with a tentative tongue.
[50:32.01]The flavor is not pleasant, but it does not appear acrid.
[50:35.43]Perhaps it is not poisonous.
[50:36.63]Eat it.
[50:36.83]Remember this happened before?
[50:39.17]I already did this, you know?
[50:43.26]I already ate this shit and it felt good.
[50:45.49]Feeling bolder, you put the clump of moss into your mouth and chew.
[50:49.07]Thick yellow juices run down your chin.
[50:52.19]Swallowing the thick clump is hard, but almost as soon as you do, you feel a great warmth spreading up from your stomach.
[50:58.26]Whatever this moss is, it seems to be most beneficial.
[51:02.18]Look at that.
[51:02.58]Three more stamina.
[51:03.54]We're going back to 20, boys and girls.
[51:05.72]It's going to happen.
[51:08.20]Let's go down the steps.
[51:09.42]I don't want to waste any stamina on spells right now.
[51:13.04]Zap the moss.
[51:14.93]You stride onto the ancient stone staircase, trusting it will not crumble beneath your weight.
[51:19.19]Then, one pace at a time, you make your way slowly down to the sunken lands below.
[51:26.02]Alright, halfway down.
[51:28.32]Let's see.
[51:28.68]Hey, remember, no decision is permanent, guys.
[51:31.70]I can, like, rewind.
[51:35.96]Let's keep going.
[51:39.83]You clamber down the ancient stairs.
[51:41.51]It is painstaking work as every step is about the height of your own body.
[51:46.50]Body.
[51:47.66]Then about halfway to the ground, you are forced to stop.
[51:50.32]The steps below have fallen to rubble.
[51:55.30]I can still hear him yelling at me.
[51:59.97]Alright.
[52:03.69]Let's keep going down.
[52:05.33]You have no choice.
[52:06.53]I'm not turning back.
[52:07.21]No rewinds.
[52:10.14]So we're jumping.
[52:12.86]Taste the stairs.
[52:13.72]I can climb back up or I can jump over this like chasm.
[52:18.44]What is this way?
[52:21.31]Big open plane.
[52:24.49]Rewind to the voice crack.
[52:25.91]Yeah, I know, right?
[52:32.65]Let's just jump jumping.
[52:35.39]You take a moment to gather your courage and then let yourself fall far and fast onto broken stones.
[52:42.58]This is going to hurt me, isn't it?
[52:43.54]Land.
[52:45.40]Fuck.
[52:46.36]You land badly and for a moment you are afraid that you've broken your ankle, but you manage to stand.
[52:52.88]The foot of the cliff is punctured by little holes, perhaps the Warren of hill foxes or whatever equivalent inhabitants these barren wastes.
[53:02.15]Inhabit these barren wastes.
[53:05.12]So I just broke my fucking ankle.
[53:07.92]That's great.
[53:10.12]You gained arthritis.
[53:13.90]Look across the plain.
[53:15.54]In the near distance across the plains and away from the cliff, you can see a stone tower.
[53:20.31]The only stone structure in the whole barren landscape.
[53:26.17]I'm floating.
[53:27.95]I'm floating back up.
[53:30.59]That's the way it is.
[53:34.28]I'm going straight up, if I can.
[53:38.87]Zen is hover.
[53:39.91]No, I don't have the jewel.
[53:41.61]Shit.
[53:44.23]Cause teleportation, no.
[53:46.27]Don't have that item.
[53:50.74]What the hell is dock?
[53:51.86]Heal disease?
[53:54.24]Why would I need to heal a disease?
[54:00.56]I have enough stamina to zap.
[54:03.28]No, there's no zap.
[54:04.08]There's only Zen.
[54:04.72]Holy shit.
[54:06.63]I almost just accidentally clicked that and just wasted everything.
[54:08.99]Okay.
[54:14.45]Give me one second.
[54:21.18]Here we go.
[54:24.62]Make a move.
[54:25.28]Let's go.
[54:29.78]I don't want to waste any more time.
[54:31.94]Oh shit, there's a lot of places to go here.
[54:36.47]Follow the cliff the old road into the plane or follow the cliff.
[54:43.68]I'm just running right into the plane.
[54:45.18]Get right in the open.
[54:47.52]Open field.
[54:50.65]Leaving the shadow of the cliff you step out across the plain, a few clouds scud across the sky.
[54:55.79]This, then, is the pit of the Backlands.
[54:58.58]It is not as fearsome as you had expected, while maybe the sludge and grime of Kare has toughened your resolve.
[55:04.10]But it is mostly empty, rather than dire.
[55:06.86]The air is dusty, but not fetid.
[55:09.92]It's like a weird little poem going on in here.
[55:11.67]There are few places for monsters to hide, so I'm safe.
[55:14.89]You must continue to journey, but you are weaker than you realize.
[55:17.73]Perhaps you should simply rest here for a few hours and regain some strength.
[55:24.08]Yeah, sure, why not?
[55:27.00]Gratefully, you seat yourself and center the meditative state taught to you by your masters.
[55:33.15]A sensation of great peace enters your body.
[55:36.51]Okay, hours pass.
[55:38.52]The sun has reached its highest point now.
[55:40.26]Out of the shade, the air is baking hot.
[55:42.10]You stand once more.
[55:45.04]Let's keep going.
[55:46.20]I want to get all the way across.
[55:50.06]You make your slow way across the endless wastes.
[55:52.81]The sun is beginning to lower.
[55:54.29]The air begins to cool.
[55:56.41]You crest a low rise and look down across the barren wastes, offering something of a view.
[56:00.67]Let's look north.
[56:03.82]Looking north, a deep, dark gash seems to cut across the land.
[56:06.94]It must be a fissure of some kind.
[56:10.03]East.
[56:11.17]The road makes a loop past the foothills of the Badubak Ridge, passing an unusual spiked rock formation.
[56:19.07]Get a tan.
[56:20.23]South, you can make out a single tree lifting dead branches to the gray sky.
[56:24.99]And that is all there is to see.
[56:26.85]East of the Badubak Ridge lie the Clatterback Steps, which you must cross to reach the lake.
[56:34.38]You see what I'm talking about?
[56:35.16]You see what I mean by this place is fucking huge?
[56:37.62]This place is gigantic.
[56:40.70]It's enormous.
[56:44.40]Let's see, we got Northwest.
[56:47.70]North Road.
[56:50.28]By the tree.
[56:51.96]Or the South Road.
[56:53.39]Hmm.
[56:55.67]Sap the tree.
[56:57.71]Let's go give the tree depression.
[56:59.07]Listen to me, son!
[57:01.93]What do I say, son?
[57:08.74]Let's go buy the tree.
[57:10.50]Tree time.
[57:12.66]I want to go to the tree.
[57:13.58]I'm going to zap the tree if it's possible.
[57:18.09]You carry on tramping across the dusty plains, keeping your eyes and ears open for warnings of danger.
[57:22.85]The wind picks up as the evening draws on.
[57:25.17]It will be night soon again already.
[57:27.89]After a while of walking, you see something to break the monotony.
[57:31.21]Too tall and thin for a skewer of a rock or a building.
[57:33.63]You cannot place it until you get close.
[57:35.81]It's a single tree, leafless and dead, tilting from the desolate soil.
[57:42.67]I'm going to climb the tree.
[57:45.10]Thinking you could get a better view of the land from the upper branches, you swing yourself onto the lowest bow, then up onto the next.
[57:52.16]A moment later, you're on the ground with a painful thump.
[57:54.88]You didn't slip, you reached for a branch, and suddenly it was not there.
[57:58.24]Listen to me, son!
[58:01.50]Try climbing again.
[58:04.78]You try climbing once more, but this time all the lower branches of the tree lift as one, like a dancer raising the hem of his cloak before he begins to spin.
[58:12.21]You step back, watching the lifeless tree.
[58:16.01]The branches hover a moment, then lower back down.
[58:21.82]Anybody get that?
[58:23.38]What the fuck does that mean?
[58:26.94]Let's look at it.
[58:28.46]The tree must be the last remnant of an ancient forest.
[58:31.49]The why this particular trunk has survived when all the others fell is not clear.
[58:36.45]And that is not all.
[58:37.63]A rope ladder hangs from one of the higher branches of the tree.
[58:42.13]What?
[58:43.31]I could have just climbed a ladder?
[58:44.47]Climb the ladder!
[58:46.17]How did I not see that there was a ladder there before?
[58:49.02]Like, are you shitting me?
[58:52.64]There was a ladder there the whole time.
[58:56.10]You scramble up the rope ladder to get a view across the lands, but the branches seem to be alive, twisting and bending as you climb.
[59:02.63]They are closing in around you like a trap.
[59:05.17]Oh, fuck.
[59:06.31]Um... Cut the branches away.
[59:09.98]You draw your broadsword and attempt to cut the branches away, but they move and bend out of reach of your sword.
[59:14.40]A moment later, another branch draws backwards behind you and releases, knocking you painfully to the ground.
[59:20.42]For a moment, you hear a sound almost like a laugh.
[59:27.82]Who goes there?
[59:29.08]You demand.
[59:30.72]Stranger.
[59:31.90]The voices faint, yet echoing.
[59:33.75]Stranger.
[59:35.87]Show yourself!
[59:36.99]You demand.
[59:37.89]There is no response.
[59:38.95]Surely this land is a desert.
[59:40.43]You are entirely alone, are you not?
[59:44.33]Let's see.
[59:45.25]Let's see what this motherfucker has to say.
[59:51.16]Let's see what this guy has got to say.
[59:53.66]Oh, what's that?
[59:54.70]Oh, what's that?
[59:55.42]Excuse me, tree?
[59:56.65]Oh, tree, excuse me.
[59:57.59]You think it's funny to grab people and fucking suffocate them?
[60:00.79]Burn.
[60:02.31]You cast a spell, winding a fireball in your palm.
[60:04.49]It lights the plane with its red and flickering glow, but nothing else happens.
[60:08.67]Throw it at the tree or threaten the voice.
[60:13.36]Hey, you better say who the fuck you are or I'm burning this tree down.
[60:19.90]Should I even give him an opportunity?
[60:24.40]Throw it at the fucking tree.
[60:26.00]You hurl the ball at the tree.
[60:27.68]The desecrated wood erupts instantly into a pillar of flame, sending black smoke up to the sky.
[60:33.45]There is no other cry or whimper or any sound.
[60:36.53]The voice you heard is lost beneath the cracking, crackling wood, and soon all of that is burnt away, leaving nothing but a stump.
[60:44.23]You stand by the smoking stump of the ancient tree.
[60:46.69]Nothing of it remains.
[60:54.95]That tree was bad.
[60:56.05]Okay?
[60:59.17]Stop killing old things.
[61:00.87]We don't negotiate with trees.
[61:06.15]Fuck.
[61:08.53]I feel like I shouldn't have done that.
[61:09.63]I feel like I shouldn't have done that.
[61:14.09]I felt like that this whole game, though.
[61:15.44]Back to one stamina.
[61:16.24]Great.
[61:16.46]That's fucking fantastic.
[61:18.54]Let's go along the road.
[61:22.06]Why would you do that?
[61:24.40]You walk on across the plain until you meet the edge of an old road.
[61:27.15]The sun is sinking in the sky.
[61:29.87]It's turning bruised purple.
[61:31.17]Soon it will be dark.
[61:33.67]The road snakes across the dust bowl.
[61:36.27]The road snakes across the dust bowl.
[61:38.43]In the name of Jesus Christ.
[61:40.67]Alright, honest to God, I think I've gotten like 200 Twitch Prime subs today.
[61:50.50]This is fucking insanity.
[61:55.99]That's fucking unbelievable.
[61:59.05]I can't believe this many people want to give me their free sub.
[62:03.09]Thanks.
[62:03.41]Excuse me.
[62:20.64]Okay, I'm drawing my sword.
[62:22.24]You draw your sword.
[62:22.90]The voice adds, there's no need for that.
[62:25.32]I only wanted to tell you.
[62:27.10]The voice fades away mid-word.
[62:30.18]What?
[62:33.02]I'm going for a fire.
[62:34.04]No, look around.
[62:36.27]You turn around to find the road deserted.
[62:37.85]There is no one in sight in any direction.
[62:40.96]Hearing voices, are you?
[62:42.56]Lorag asks dryly.
[62:45.20]Lorag, what was that?
[62:47.36]An echo, the wizard replies.
[62:49.40]One that has been rolling around this valley for hundreds of years.
[62:52.54]Never quite able to escape.
[62:56.68]An echo cannot last for hundreds of years.
[62:58.78]What are you talking about, dude?
[63:01.18]That rather depends on the nature of the walls, the withered replies.
[63:06.17]Don't they call this place the Pit of Badabak?
[63:09.49]The cold wind whistles around you.
[63:10.79]The plains feel suddenly far emptier than a moment before.
[63:14.11]You continue along the ghost road.
[63:18.13]Huh.
[63:19.01]Hmm.
[63:20.01]Well.
[63:21.61]Well.
[63:22.72]Interesting.
[63:27.76]Interesting.
[63:30.60]That is interesting.
[63:37.29]Let's see.
[63:40.40]Hold on a second.
[63:43.35]Shit, I can't hear that.
[63:44.61]Ah, I can't hear.
[63:45.05]There we go.
[63:45.81]Now I can hear.
[63:46.53]That was really weird.
[63:51.29]Why can I not hear?
[63:51.87]Did my, like, my, like, audio just fucked up?
[63:54.67]Hold on a second.
[64:00.49]One second.
[64:01.43]One second.
[64:02.33]One second.
[64:03.23]One second.
[64:09.17]What the hell happened?
[64:20.65]Alright.
[64:27.43]Can you guys hear the game?
[64:30.63]Good.
[64:31.01]I think you can.
[64:31.49]Yeah.
[64:33.43]At least you should be able to.
[64:34.24]Going to keep going east.
[64:40.31]follow the old road the sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky the road forks here with the main path snaking up the mountainside to the east rocks have tumbled down the slope and all but covered the road hmm no no no you can't hear the game audio really you should be able to I can hear it
[65:14.13]Jerma, listen to us.
[65:17.63]We can't hear you.
[65:18.91]We can hear you.
[65:19.61]Uh-oh, they're doing the mic muted.
[65:23.04]It's just wind.
[65:23.56]Okay, I just want to make sure you can actually hear it.
[65:24.82]What the fuck is that noise?
[65:28.60]Okay, that was actually kind of scary.
[65:32.19]Alright, look east.
[65:34.33]You cast your gaze east towards the towering Badubak Ridge.
[65:37.81]The main peak is lost in haze at the end of the long winding road that climbs the slope.
[65:43.36]Alright, we're walking on.
[65:44.84]Stones shift and move on our foot as you walk.
[65:46.26]Alright, this looks like we go up here.
[65:52.86]We can go to the right, which brings us to the mountain path.
[65:55.68]So, we know rewinds, we ain't going back west.
[66:00.32]I'm going to leave it up to you guys.
[66:01.18]Do you want to go over, like, the mountain?
[66:03.48]Or do you want to go over to, like, the weird hut?
[66:06.42]The first.
[66:08.04]The first straw poll of the evening.
[66:14.42]The first.
[66:15.81]The first.
[66:20.65]Which way?
[66:24.19]North?
[66:25.99]Or... Mountain?
[66:27.25]Mountain.
[66:32.69]Great pull.
[66:34.80]Here you go.
[66:36.42]Here it is.
[66:37.04]Oh no, don't spam it in chat.
[66:43.02]You gotta go to that straw fall.
[66:45.54]And you gotta vote.
[66:47.16]Gotta vote.
[66:48.58]Gotta vote.
[66:52.56]North seems to have taken a considerable early lead.
[66:59.24]Which way is Jan?
[67:00.15]I'm surprised we didn't see him again.
[67:02.46]I really thought we were going to see him again.
[67:06.32]Just get in a plane.
[67:09.40]Well, you have like a fly spell.
[67:10.84]You can like hover and float in the air.
[67:15.41]This is not... So, I'll give you... I'll look at the map.
[67:19.95]See, north goes up this way.
[67:23.21]And the mountainside goes this way.
[67:27.18]Over to the cloudaband steps.
[67:28.84]Seems like a little swampy area.
[67:33.41]Hey, thanks for the hundred bits.
[67:35.55]I haven't said any of, like, I haven't thanked any of the subscribers that have been coming in.
[67:39.21]Like, the fucking tons of them.
[67:42.95]It is so overwhelming right now for my brain.
[67:47.06]But thank you, nonetheless.
[67:48.68]Everybody.
[67:51.44]Oh, it's getting close.
[67:55.58]Those are some loud bits.
[67:56.70]I could probably turn that down a little bit.
[68:01.93]Yeah, I'll turn that down.
[68:05.53]I'll turn it down.
[68:09.59]Alright, maybe another 10 to 20 seconds.
[68:21.53]Alright.
[68:23.32]Looks like we're going north.
[68:26.36]5 seconds.
[68:32.86]Do you want to be a mountain man?
[68:36.16]Is it?
[68:37.41]Five, four, three, two, one.
[68:42.61]Thank you for voting.
[68:43.35]We're going north.
[68:44.51]You have decided.
[68:45.97]Close that poll.
[68:47.69]Thank you.
[68:48.00]We're going north.
[68:49.48]Up to the weird middle finger hut.
[69:01.08]Alright.
[69:01.30]I mean, obviously gotta... Gotta look at that rock.
[69:05.06]Obviously gotta look at that rock.
[69:25.22]The rock is a single, shattered spire, perhaps once part of the shadowy mountain range to the east, or perhaps driven up through the ground by some geological quirk.
[69:34.14]At the base of the rock is the mouth of a cave.
[69:39.65]You don't give me a cave and tell me I'm not going inside of it.
[69:43.73]You approach the cave with one hand on your blade.
[69:45.97]In the dark, it is hard to say how far back it goes, but someone has been here.
[69:50.81]There is a stack of pebbles against one wall, a little like the cairns in the tunnel of Manticore.
[69:56.92]Cairns in the tunnel of the Manticore.
[69:59.44]So somebody's been in the cave.
[70:01.94]Can I just sleep in the cave?
[70:04.44]Oh, yeah, this is a nice cave!
[70:06.32]Can I, like, lie down in it?
[70:09.38]I'll take some, you know, pebbles, I'll take some pebbles.
[70:11.62]Because I can use those to make explosions.
[70:15.10]Uh, you better believe I'm making, like, I'm gonna throw, like, a grenade at, like, the next bad guy.
[70:22.41]Um, let's take a nap in the cave.
[70:26.13]You make your way inside the cave and find a dark and safe corner.
[70:29.23]Setting down your pack of the rocks, you try to stretch out despite the wind.
[70:32.81]Thankfully, you are not hungry.
[70:36.41]Take a little snooze.
[70:38.35]You lie back and try to forget your troubles.
[70:40.44]Your last thoughts are the curses of Lorag in your mind.
[70:44.24]You feel quite safe, and you do not dream.
[70:46.62]Day two of the backline.
[70:54.43]You reached the pit of the backlands and found no new clues.
[71:02.14]When morning comes, you step back out onto the empty plain.
[71:04.96]Sunlight falls into the cave mouth, picking out marks in the stone.
[71:09.68]Someone seems to have scratched a message into the rock inside the cave.
[71:13.40]It is only just legible and must be ancient.
[71:17.17]Read it.
[71:18.57]In the thin sunlight falling into the cave, you can make out the ancient scratch message with some difficulty.
[71:24.22]Stranger, I am waiting.
[71:27.16]Very long ago.
[71:28.88]Summon you.
[71:30.26]Call my name to the skies and I will... Madara.
[71:36.48]Try calling out a name.
[71:38.98]The message on the cave wall suggested calling out a name, but what name should you call?
[71:43.76]Vic, Flanker, Slang, Shadrick, Jain, Sanses, or Lorag.
[71:51.71]Lorag, help me.
[71:54.63]Everybody's gonna want me to fucking do, uh... Everybody's gonna want me to say, uh, Flanker.
[72:01.10]If I don't say Flanker, you guys are gonna lose your minds.
[72:06.04]See, I can already see the chat.
[72:07.38]If I don't... Flanker.
[72:09.60]Flanker!
[72:10.58]Your cry rings out across the plane.
[72:12.56]Perhaps a malevolent creature has heard you, but nothing else happens.
[72:19.58]Vic for first noble you cry out rings across the plane still nothing perhaps one of her magic was supposed to work is long gone Shadrach
[72:33.47]You cry the name across the plains and the echo of it seems to set off a distant avalanche.
[72:37.77]The ground begins to shake and rumble and you stagger to your knees.
[72:41.30]The very Earth is moving as though it was splitting or merging back together.
[72:45.40]You reach down to steady yourself only to find that grass is growing between your fingers.
[72:55.36]You pick yourself up unsteadily to your feet, feeling sick and unwell.
[72:59.54]Everything around you is the same, but everything is different.
[73:03.30]The rock has two spires, for one thing.
[73:05.60]The cave seems smaller and darker.
[73:07.80]And in a fire pit built into the scrub at its mouth, a fire is burning.
[73:12.28]From inside, you hear the gentle sound of singing.
[73:14.46]Approach the fire.
[73:19.22]You approach the fire, the sound of singing from inside the cave grows louder.
[73:25.29]Shadrach, uh, you in here, bro?
[73:29.27]The singing stops abruptly, there is a coughing and wheezing sound, and then an old man hobbles out from the cave, limping on a stick.
[73:36.28]This must be Shadrach himself.
[73:40.92]Ah, it's you, he declares, speaking thickly through his beard.
[73:45.48]I have been expecting you.
[73:47.39]He waves a hand around the landscape.
[73:49.29]Welcome back.
[73:52.61]Welcome back?
[73:55.60]Just so.
[73:56.76]You have come a long, long way, my Anor Lander friend.
[74:00.38]He smiles.
[74:01.62]I know your mission, of course.
[74:03.82]I know all about you.
[74:05.94]And you know about me, I hope.
[74:08.56]My name is Shadrach.
[74:11.86]I need to talk to you.
[74:14.09]I believe you can help me.
[74:16.41]I believe I can, he nods.
[74:18.73]I know you journey here from Kari.
[74:21.19]Tell me, how fares that city?
[74:23.82]You hear the voice of Lorag in your mind, boiling with fury.
[74:26.76]Let's do it alright.
[74:31.31]It's the same as always.
[74:33.17]It's fine.
[74:34.63]The same as always, you lie.
[74:36.57]Lorag spits and splutters, but try as he might, he cannot move your lips for you.
[74:42.32]He laughs.
[74:44.10]I watched an army of marsh goblins scale the cliffs armed with swords and axes.
[74:48.54]Now I fancy I see smoke rising from the horizon.
[74:52.08]He grabs a handful of dry grass from the ground and tosses it into the fire pit, where it blazes for a moment into flame.
[74:58.84]He appears to change topic.
[75:01.42]I must warn you that no one from Analand has ever crossed the Backlands alone and survived.
[75:09.80]Were there seven snakes?
[75:12.66]I've been told there are seven serpents, you reply, and I was told you could aid me.
[75:17.90]The serpents are most terrible.
[75:19.76]I have often seen them, but they are no mere snakes.
[75:23.14]Do you know of their legend?
[75:24.32]You know, you could tell me.
[75:26.92]I could sit here all day.
[75:28.38]Just tell me how to kill them.
[75:30.88]Well then, each serpent has a spirit to sustain it.
[75:34.56]That grants a great power, but also a powerful weakness.
[75:38.55]Discover these weaknesses, and you may be able to defeat the serpents.
[75:43.63]Unexpectedly, Shadrach stumbles.
[75:46.19]He smiles at you weakly.
[75:50.29]have any food?
[75:53.87]Sadrak shakes his head.
[75:54.89]I am too holy to eat, but if you can reach Karamina, if you can reach Karima, Karima, Kariyama, north of the river, you may be able to eat well there, if it still exists in your time.
[76:11.51]Most likely it does not.
[76:13.49]Sadrak is shivering slightly now.
[76:15.37]His face is pale beyond the ruddy beard.
[76:19.50]What are the serpent's weaknesses?
[76:22.00]Do you know what their weaknesses are?
[76:23.39]You demand urgently.
[76:24.81]He shakes his head.
[76:26.17]Ah, but those are the most closely guarded secrets, hidden from simple divination.
[76:31.27]Please remember, to me, all this is yet to pass.
[76:34.01]He smiles thinly.
[76:35.40]But one thing I have seen.
[76:36.56]I have seen the air spirit defeated, and I can tell you how it was done.
[76:41.28]Okay, go on.
[76:46.43]It happened like this.
[76:48.23]The air serpent, huge and terrible, was transforming its being into a puff of gas that could suffocate and choke its foes.
[76:55.11]But in this form, its empty body was weak.
[76:57.53]And when that husk was destroyed, the serpent was destroyed also.
[77:04.88]Friend, I wish I did not have to go.
[77:08.88]But I must, if I am to close the circle.
[77:14.23]Ah!
[77:15.32]Where are you going?
[77:16.82]I go to rest.
[77:20.32]I will plant my feet into the Earth and lift my arms as branches and drink in the sunshine for as long as there is water in the soil.
[77:29.19]Time to leave.
[77:30.69]He raises his arms to demonstrate, laughs, almost teeters over, catches himself with a stick and begins to cough violently.
[77:38.13]There is not too much time.
[77:45.62]But I have so much to ask you.
[77:47.73]He was the tree.
[78:04.22]We will meet again.
[78:05.28]Oh, I have so much to ask you.
[78:07.34]Sadrak nods.
[78:08.80]We will meet again.
[78:09.68]That is my intention, at least.
[78:12.22]He waves a hand at his cave.
[78:14.40]I have left one more thing for you in there.
[78:17.08]Travel well.
[78:18.44]Remember, when you walk through the fields of Ishtara, you are safe from the serpents.
[78:23.36]But if you do not return to your own time, you will never defeat them.
[78:30.83]Okay, I understand.
[78:32.47]Good, he nods.
[78:33.59]Look to the beacons, he adds cryptically.
[78:36.25]If any have survived into your time, they will hold a little of our ancient light still.
[78:41.27]There is one to the north of here, at least by the river.
[78:44.29]Go there.
[78:45.53]Reaching over, he places his hand on either side of your head, and you feel a great lightness entering your body.
[78:51.34]That done, he turns and stamps away across the grass.
[78:58.14]Wait!
[78:59.40]You call after him, but a moment later he has disappeared, lost in the haze that hangs above the grasslands.
[79:04.54]To have vanished so completely, there must be something strange about this land, or else there is an unseen pit in the ground.
[79:11.39]You are left alone by the cave mouth once more.
[79:15.09]Let's see if he had any snacks.
[79:17.32]You look into the cave again and this time find a strange horn hanging from a hook on the wall.
[79:21.62]It is ornately carved from strange twisting shells with a hide of leather.
[79:26.40]It's a gale horn, one of the very few in existence.
[79:30.22]You lift it down with great care.
[79:34.65]Let's test it.
[79:36.97]Blow the horn.
[79:38.35]You place the horn to your lips and blow a note.
[79:40.25]It is a clean and mellow pitch and makes the air Ster with echoes.
[79:43.85]You silently thank the hermit for his gift.
[79:48.55]alright so uh that that was the tree got this guy why do I always do something bad oh I can't I can't wait to become a tree he was just like trying to grab me but he like fucking squeezed me what was with the big squeeze he was trying to suffocate me just want to give me a hug
[80:16.91]You pause to look around the plain.
[80:18.27]Thin scrub grass stretches out away north and west.
[80:21.85]To the east, the mountains are shadowing the sun.
[80:24.47]The whole world seems to have come alive around, but surely this magic cannot last.
[80:29.59]You make your way back to the old road that runs past the rock.
[80:32.81]To the north, you catch a glimpse of the tower Shadrach mentioned, covered in green ivy.
[80:38.12]West, you notice a young tree that surely wasn't there before.
[80:43.50]Wait, what?
[80:49.62]Let's go over to the tree.
[80:52.52]You head out across the prairie.
[80:53.90]The air stirs a little, still cold, but at least fresh.
[80:57.24]You swat at pestering flies and midges.
[80:59.92]The dead tree you saw here earlier is now a young, strong sapling.
[81:03.95]In its shadow, a woman sits cross-legged with closed eyes.
[81:10.53]Burn this tree.
[81:11.99]Kill it.
[81:23.01]I burned this tree in the past, and I burned the tree in the future.
[81:27.31]Dear God.
[81:30.96]Wow.
[81:33.90]Alright, we're gonna have to look at the woman.
[81:38.04]You watch the woman for a moment.
[81:39.48]She is breathing in and out slowly and murmuring under her breath.
[81:43.10]Perhaps she is praying.
[81:45.16]Around her neck she wears what looks like a giant's tooth on a leather string.
[81:49.28]A fleet of long, thin birds swoop and career overhead, snatching flies from the steamy air.
[81:58.32]That's a giant's tooth.
[81:59.46]I can summon a giant.
[82:00.68]If I get that tooth, I get a giant.
[82:02.92]Eventually.
[82:06.85]Mmm, what to do?
[82:12.95]Burn that woman to the ground.
[82:14.95]Steal the tooth.
[82:16.11]You creep forward intent on snatching the pendant from around the woman's neck, but you do not get closer than a single step.
[82:22.00]The woman opens one eye, then shakes her head sadly.
[82:26.50]You're meant to be over there, she says, pointing a little way to the east.
[82:31.88]I go where I please, you tell her archly.
[82:36.17]Indeed you do.
[82:39.67]Only I had imagined you not quite where you are.
[82:43.81]As she speaks, she taps a spot on her forehead.
[82:46.98]No matter.
[82:48.18]They tell me I will get better at divination with practice.
[82:51.92]She offers her hand.
[82:52.74]Who the fuck is this voice?
[82:56.32]Push her aside.
[83:00.09]Alright, I'll shake her hand.
[83:02.64]You shake her hand and she laughs.
[83:05.00]How very formal.
[83:06.58]Well met, stranger.
[83:08.14]My name is Althera.
[83:09.60]Welcome to Ishtara, the land of peace and plenty.
[83:15.66]Aye.
[83:16.39]You nod.
[83:17.01]She nods politely in return.
[83:19.31]Will you sit with me a while?
[83:23.99]Sure.
[83:24.73]Why not?
[83:25.29]Let's have a little lunch date.
[83:28.13]You sit down on the long grass opposite her.
[83:29.77]She smiles at you.
[83:31.91]I need to practice my third eye, she says, tapping what appears to be a small gem stuck to her forehead.
[83:37.84]Perhaps we could play Swindle Stones.
[83:45.81]You knew it was going to happen somewhere.
[83:48.43]She produces a hand... Oh, Swindle Stones!
[83:50.60]A fucking Swindle!
[83:51.46]I love that game!
[83:54.03]She looks amused.
[83:55.41]Swindle stones?
[83:57.29]My teacher has used that name before, but that is not what we call them.
[84:01.37]They are mind stones.
[84:03.37]I try to read your thoughts as you try to read mine.
[84:06.37]Will you play?
[84:10.34]You begin to cast upwards to the stars when Altheria catches your arm.
[84:13.78]Please.
[84:14.78]This is not a game of magic, but a game of inner sense.
[84:18.06]She taps the center of her forehead.
[84:23.57]I was about to be like, fuck this lady.
[84:25.47]It's just gas.
[84:26.11]Like, burn her.
[84:31.60]Zap her, then burn.
[84:34.54]Uh, babies, you can read minds.
[84:35.78]That's not fair.
[84:38.16]But you can read minds.
[84:39.50]She shakes her head.
[84:40.92]No, I'm learning.
[84:42.80]But the sense is weak with me.
[84:44.54]Please help me practice.
[84:47.11]Alright, what's at stake?
[84:48.59]She laughs.
[84:49.01]Perhaps if you win, I will give you the dice.
[84:51.47]How's that?
[84:53.84]Cool, I don't lose anything.
[84:55.16]Let's go.
[84:55.46]That's... That's what she sounds like.
[85:02.51]That lady, that voice does not match at all.
[85:07.97]Wait, what?
[85:15.35]Let's go.
[85:23.37]Alright, what do we got?
[85:24.19]One.
[85:25.75]Two fours.
[85:26.37]Alright, let's go with... You know what?
[85:32.00]We're going right off the bat.
[85:34.20]Three fours.
[85:36.40]She's going to be like, no way, I can't believe it.
[85:40.62]Three fours.
[85:41.89]She's going to be screwed here.
[85:44.37]Whoa!
[85:45.89]She called immediately.
[85:46.93]Come on, please have a four.
[85:53.59]She can read my mind.
[85:54.41]This is not fair.
[85:54.91]I'm going to lose.
[85:55.47]She can read my mind.
[85:57.69]One moment here.
[85:58.41]Hold on a second.
[86:01.84]Two fours.
[86:06.84]I'm going to fucking lose.
[86:13.74]Gambling never ends.
[86:14.66]Alright.
[86:15.66]Well, she has two... Three fours.
[86:22.26]four fours I highly doubt that because that means you have all of them essentially called yeah couldn't read my mind that time three three V three let's do it this is a unbelievable hand so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna her that is that is that it is one two
[86:47.85]Oh, one four.
[86:48.67]Oh, really?
[86:50.45]I dare you to call this.
[86:51.29]That means four threes.
[86:54.44]Four threes.
[86:55.18]Call it.
[86:56.28]Call me out on this.
[86:57.78]Do it.
[86:59.28]Do it.
[86:59.96]Call.
[87:01.54]Call.
[87:01.84]Yeah, you know you were going to call.
[87:04.42]And I am going to win.
[87:06.70]What's that?
[87:07.52]There are four threes.
[87:09.46]I win again.
[87:09.90]Alright.
[87:14.83]Another good hand.
[87:17.43]1-1.
[87:17.57]Let's go with 2-1.
[87:23.01]And then she's gonna just completely screw herself.
[87:27.14]2?
[87:27.36]Well, okay.
[87:28.36]She has a 1 and a 4.
[87:38.94]Yeah, you called me out on my own game.
[87:41.70]Reveal the dice.
[87:42.96]What's that?
[87:44.28]Get swindled.
[87:47.68]Turn up with a master swindler.
[87:52.22]Alright, we got... I can really say whatever I want here.
[87:56.62]1, 2.
[87:56.98]Doesn't matter.
[87:57.74]She's not going to call that.
[87:58.58]That'd be stupid.
[87:59.46]1, 5.
[88:00.32]Okay, so you have 1, 5.
[88:02.30]2, 5s.
[88:04.96]Oh, 4s.
[88:05.38]Sorry.
[88:07.18]So now 2, 5s.
[88:08.21]Now she's going to say... Oh, whoa.
[88:09.79]3, 5s.
[88:10.15]Sorry.
[88:11.59]Sorry.
[88:12.05]That's a call.
[88:13.33]And you lost the game.
[88:14.91]I will take your swindler's wings.
[88:18.01]I win.
[88:20.53]Altheria laughs.
[88:22.15]You are a challenging mind.
[88:24.09]May we play again?
[88:24.95]No, I just beat you.
[88:27.27]Give me the dice.
[88:29.22]You reply, no more shaking your head.
[88:31.12]You are a feeble opponent.
[88:33.10]She nods, gathering up the dice.
[88:34.38]She drops them into your palm.
[88:36.22]Here, take these.
[88:37.96]You will have better use of them than I. I foresee as much.
[88:43.04]Ah, shit.
[88:45.40]I get a chance to be like a good person here.
[88:51.97]Maybe if I give them back to her, she'll give me the giant's tooth.
[88:55.91]What if I don't have any... Everybody has dice already.
[88:57.77]What do I need these for?
[89:05.75]I'm gonna give them back.
[89:08.33]I'm giving them back.
[89:08.85]I gotta do at least one nice thing.
[89:12.07]You guys, come on.
[89:14.83]Gently you hand back the dice.
[89:17.21]Do not give up, you advise her.
[89:19.45]Many things take time.
[89:21.58]She looks into your eyes thoughtfully, then nods.
[89:24.42]Thank you, stranger.
[89:25.90]You are kind.
[89:27.50]You hear Lorag scoffing in your mind, but for a moment at least you can ignore his miserable voice.
[89:33.30]She smiles and gets to her feet.
[89:35.54]I must be going.
[89:36.57]Travel well.
[89:37.83]Come and visit me, if you will.
[89:39.41]She waves in the direction of the cliff you came down when you entered the Backlands, but quite why is not clear.
[89:46.43]Then she hurries away.
[89:49.87]Let's take a look at the tree.
[89:53.82]The tree is relatively young, fresh, and strong, as though it has been only planted a few minutes before.
[89:59.10]It is hard to believe this is the same tree that you saw before, so tall and so very dead.
[90:03.32]The position is the same.
[90:08.97]Ask Lorag for dating advice.
[90:13.89]Slide into those DMs.
[90:18.56]Oh, God.
[90:20.93]With the woman gone, you look around the plain.
[90:22.93]South and west, the great fault line of the cliffs shields out the sky, and at its top, it seems as dark as night.
[90:29.51]North, the grass stretches away towards a distant flashing line that seems to cut across the land.
[90:35.36]You turn your attention back to the landscape.
[90:41.88]Okay, it seems... Alright, so this is like the time warp area, it seems, yeah?
[90:52.99]Now from what I remember, of all the games, of all four parts, I think I remember this one the least.
[91:00.79]But I do remember this weird time travel mechanic where there's essentially two full maps here.
[91:09.61]There's the future, there's like the present and the past in every spot.
[91:14.52]It's kind of fucking crazy.
[91:17.70]That's all I remember.
[91:19.98]I'm gonna go north.
[91:24.75]No decision is permanent.
[91:25.67]Click the rewind button.
[91:28.47]No rewinds.
[91:31.35]You walk on across the grassland until you join an old road.
[91:34.45]As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.
[91:36.94]Away from the road to the northeast, a curious stone tower stands alone overlooking the river.
[91:44.10]Into the tower.
[91:44.78]Let's get it.
[91:48.51]You leave the well-paved road and walk across the grassy fields that have somehow replaced the plain that was here before.
[91:54.14]The sun is hot now.
[91:55.96]You reach the shadow of the tower you spotted while climbing down the cliff.
[91:59.22]Its sides are too smooth to be natural, and that there are no stones or brickwork.
[92:03.88]It is like a gigantic game piece, carved from a single block of stone.
[92:08.57]Thick gripweed curls up and around the tower like wool round a bobbin.
[92:12.89]Beyond it, a river rushes past.
[92:17.44]Let's tug on the gripweed.
[92:20.40]You give the gripweed shoots a sharp tug.
[92:23.52]The plant is tough as rope and seems to be firmly anchored into the stone of the tower.
[92:27.10]Let's see what we can do here.
[92:35.36]Is this a sap of the tower?
[92:40.22]Oh, god damn it.
[92:43.36]What is this going to achieve?
[92:44.44]This is going to achieve nothing.
[92:48.74]I'm just going to burn the tower down.
[92:53.04]That's all that's going to happen.
[92:56.04]Fine.
[92:56.60]I did it.
[92:59.52]Looking to the stars, you craft the magic, building up a charge of electrical energy around your palm.
[93:05.57]Zap at the tower.
[93:07.91]You release the bolt at the tower.
[93:09.43]Some of the gripweed blackens and smokes away into ash.
[93:14.77]There goes three fucking stamina.
[93:17.13]We're climbing it.
[93:19.16]The weed seems to grow all the way to the top.
[93:23.06]I just... You can't not zap.
[93:30.25]And wouldn't this be electrified right now?
[93:34.45]Quickly, you grab the gripweed and scramble up the outside of the tower.
[93:37.12]The roots of the thick plant offer plenty of footholds, and the scent is easy enough.
[93:42.60]Soon, you are hauling yourself over the battlements onto the top of the tower.
[93:46.62]To the top of the tower.
[93:49.32]Pray to Lorag?
[93:50.74]I can.
[93:51.10]I can pray to Lorag.
[93:53.24]Although I don't know if that's a good idea.
[93:58.58]It's stone.
[94:01.58]If I didn't zap this tower, I never would have heard the end of it.
[94:05.67]I would have felt so bad that I didn't zap when I had the opportunity to zap.
[94:09.89]Always zap.
[94:10.95]Every time.
[94:15.28]You stand atop the tower.
[94:16.30]The wind across the prairie whips at your hood and the ground seems like an endless green sea far below.
[94:21.70]But the top is not empty.
[94:23.38]Indeed, there is barely room to stand.
[94:25.71]Most of the floor space is taken up by a large brass contraption that has been built into the middle of the roof.
[94:34.29]Look at the contraption.
[94:36.10]This tower was clearly built to house the brass contraption at the center of the turret.
[94:40.87]You look it over with puzzlement.
[94:42.65]A large brass cylinder, it is set into a bearing in the center of the tower and protrudes a short way over the battlement.
[94:49.62]It is rather like one of the city, one of the chief mage's telescopes, but why would anyone set such a complex device out here in the wastes?
[94:58.98]Look through it.
[94:59.42]Wait, what?! !
[95:23.49]Let's move it.
[95:24.69]You push the cylinder and it swivels around the top of the tower, moving quite easily as though recently oiled.
[95:30.49]Nothing else appears to happen, however.
[95:35.38]You turn your attention to the blue... Whoa, hello!
[95:38.11]You turn your attention to the blue crystal.
[95:39.61]It is not a gem you recognize.
[95:41.51]It pulses with a small interior glow, as though something lived inside.
[95:46.09]You touch the crystal, but as your fingers brush the glass, something happens, and you feel yourself whipped up into the air as though catapulted.
[95:54.29]For a dizzy moment, you seem to stare down at the entire land of Badubak.
[95:57.73]Then a moment later, you're back on your feet, head reeling, but feeling curiously powerful.
[96:05.08]Thanks, Cobb.
[96:06.04]You know what to do.
[96:08.44]Let's touch the crystal again.
[96:10.52]I'm addicted to the crystal drug.
[96:14.06]That's six zaps.
[96:15.31]Yeah, that is a lot of zaps.
[96:17.39]You reach out to touch the crystal again, only to catch yourself.
[96:20.03]The blue crystal on the contraption is flashing brilliantly, and then suddenly the cylinder ignites with a thick beam of syrupy light.
[96:28.99]The beam floods across the landscape, cutting through the mists and warping the view like a heat haze.
[96:36.71]I meant to put a message in there.
[96:37.81]I take it back.
[96:39.89]Thanks, dude.
[96:41.63]So here we go.
[96:44.38]If you take a look.
[96:46.98]The land in the light of the beam has changed.
[96:49.76]It seems the magic you witnessed earlier is happening again.
[96:53.16]Birds wheel and tumble in the air a short distance away.
[96:57.91]So if you see what's going on here now.
[97:02.30]We can adjust this beam to change time.
[97:07.18]Take a look at that bridge.
[97:09.60]This is the past.
[97:10.66]Here's the present.
[97:13.10]This is where this part gets real fucking messy.
[97:18.20]Whoa.
[97:19.44]Whoa.
[97:21.72]I screwed that up.
[97:23.78]So, I mean, I can go across the bridge.
[97:27.44]I can go over there.
[97:28.48]There's a town over there.
[97:32.91]You can point it anywhere.
[97:36.59]What about right over here?
[97:37.91]Right behind me.
[97:39.83]You can turn this back to the present.
[97:42.46]Look at all those faces on the wall.
[97:49.94]Alright.
[97:50.50]I don't know.
[97:51.88]Where should I go?
[97:55.42]Shine it over on... Shine it at Kare and make Lorag happy.
[97:59.98]That's funny.
[98:03.48]You're telling me this is the rewind scope?
[98:05.70]Yeah, this is the rewind scope.
[98:09.88]The first thing we could do... The bridge.
[98:12.62]I could easily cross this bridge.
[98:15.93]Visit the girl at the cliffs?
[98:17.53]I could do that.
[98:18.91]Alright, let's get a decision in the chat here.
[98:22.70]Am I going to go across the bridge or am I going to go find the girl on the cliff?
[98:26.78]She was like down here, right?
[98:28.32]Is it over here?
[98:30.33]She's at the cliff where I came from before.
[98:32.87]Where did I come from before?
[98:33.69]I just want to look at it.
[98:39.11]So I came from this way.
[98:43.94]So she lives like here?
[98:47.88]She must live in here, right?
[98:52.02]So, alright, now I'm going to give it to the chat.
[98:55.50]What do you guys want to do?
[98:56.84]We're either going across the bridge or we're going back to the cliff in the past.
[99:02.71]Let's get a pull up for you.
[99:10.83]Which way?
[99:15.34]Bridge?
[99:18.18]Or lady?
[99:18.86]Lady.
[99:22.31]And while you guys vote on this, I'm going to go use the bathroom.
[99:25.97]Please vote on that.
[99:27.99]Which way are we going to go?
[99:30.61]Lady or the bridge?
[99:36.01]I will be right back.
[99:36.69]I'm going to use the potty.
[99:49.30]Wait!
[99:50.04]What?! !
[102:03.36]Oh, boy.
[102:06.26]Nobody wants to go across the bridge.
[102:12.50]Seems like 82% of you want to go see the lady.
[102:17.44]Jeez.
[102:18.16]That is quite the result.
[102:22.24]Alright.
[102:22.73]I ain't coming back from this one.
[102:25.01]Sorry, all you bridge boys.
[102:27.59]I'm going to see Lady Luck.
[102:30.74]Let me point the beam over here.
[102:37.68]Is that her house?
[102:38.46]I'm assuming that's her house.
[102:41.38]Let's get a nice wide angle there.
[102:43.58]Like that.
[102:45.21]There we go.
[102:46.67]You shift the brass cylinder and then step back to regard its effects.
[102:52.87]Oh, thanks for the bits.
[102:55.05]Poll is closed.
[102:56.19]Thank you for voting.
[103:01.80]thank you okay um see when you look at the view it's gonna say the view is now partially lit with a beam from the tower and a different land appears in its light birds fly grass grows and brother this gentle wind stirring pollen in a haze let's go with the beacon blazing away you swing yourself over the battlement once more after an uncertain moment you find the grip weeding clamor swiftly down down to the bottom
[103:32.86]Alright.
[103:34.10]Leave.
[103:38.12]South of here, the Grand Road turns from west to east across the plain.
[103:41.82]So we need to go this way.
[103:44.16]Back to where we came, but it's a different place now.
[103:49.76]Although this is different too.
[103:51.24]Let's go see what's changed over here.
[103:57.26]It's getting soft as shit.
[103:58.38]I'm getting tea.
[104:01.61]Tea, Cass, tea.
[104:04.96]Sorry about that, T. You return to the road.
[104:09.50]Heat beats down from an empty sky.
[104:12.52]So now we're in the past.
[104:18.51]You step off the road and cut across the suddenly grassy field.
[104:22.27]The afternoon is starting to draw on.
[104:24.65]From behind you, a voice says, excuse me.
[104:29.11]Turn around.
[104:30.29]You rip around to find a small boy holding a gale horn in his hand.
[104:33.96]He pushes it towards you.
[104:37.86]I already have one like that.
[104:39.46]Where'd you get that, oh thief?
[104:42.10]Where'd you get that?
[104:44.40]You dropped it, the boy says.
[104:46.08]Hmm.
[104:52.45]Snatch it back.
[104:59.22]Okay.
[105:00.37]Thank you.
[105:01.45]You nod your head in thanks.
[105:03.07]The boy smiles and puts the gale horn into your hands.
[105:06.07]Then he steps back and waits for something.
[105:09.79]What is he, like a fucking hotel doorman?
[105:11.65]Alright, what do you want?
[105:15.40]You look in your pack for a suitable reward.
[105:17.54]Alright, you want to give three gold pieces.
[105:23.22]Okay, here's your three gold pieces.
[105:26.63]Here you go, kid.
[105:27.97]The boy's smile grows wide at the sight.
[105:30.57]Thank you, he breathes.
[105:32.09]By trough, I'm glad I followed you.
[105:34.22]I mean, that I was here.
[105:35.94]You know what I mean?
[105:37.06]He puts the gold into his pack.
[105:39.64]Wow, he's a fucking thief.
[105:41.14]He's following me around.
[105:43.72]You squat down into your ankles to be more at the boy's level.
[105:46.02]He's clearly local and is likely to know a lot about the area.
[105:52.48]This little boy is not going to know anything about the seven serpents.
[105:58.79]Kid, what do you know about the seven serpents?
[106:01.49]Nothing, he shrugs.
[106:02.72]Sounds like one of Shadrach's stories.
[106:07.72]Where the hell are you from?
[106:08.54]Wait, what?
[106:10.78]Swallow your gold so they can't steal it.
[106:15.59]He's from Kare.
[106:17.51]But I run errands all the way to Tin Pang sometimes.
[106:20.31]The boy is starting to look twitchy.
[106:26.20]Uh, so you know Shadrach?
[106:29.00]Of course I do, he replies.
[106:30.78]Everyone knows Shadrach.
[106:32.24]He's a brute and beats children if they make too much noise near his cave.
[106:37.58]He does not seem like a brute to me.
[106:40.00]He hates children, the boy replies.
[106:42.48]He says they are thieves and villains.
[106:45.58]The boy hops from foot to foot.
[106:50.52]Uh, how do I cross the lake?
[106:52.10]Tell me, tell me, little boy.
[106:55.38]You can usually get a ride on a fishing boat if you don't mind dawdling while they catch their fish.
[107:00.82]The boy smiles quickly.
[107:03.34]I have to go now.
[107:04.82]I really have to go.
[107:07.36]Why?
[107:08.44]I'm in a hurry, he answers uninformatively.
[107:11.50]With a final nod, he in the other direction across the gaze.
[107:16.03]It is only later you realize he somehow swiped the bracelet of bone from your fucking pack.
[107:20.43]Of course he did.
[107:22.87]Somewhere east of the Battleback Ridge is the Fane Forest of Snada.
[107:26.85]Snada cats.
[107:28.07]Perhaps the kind of place a serpent might hide.
[107:30.39]So I gave him three gold.
[107:31.61]Hold on, can I, like, chase him?
[107:39.63]I wonder if I can, like, run back and get him.
[107:52.59]No, it's not even where I'm leaving.
[107:55.37]Towards the cliff.
[107:57.29]Sort of zapped him.
[108:01.79]You continue across the verdant grassland.
[108:05.15]Days are short out here.
[108:06.40]The evening is drawing in.
[108:07.42]It will be dark soon.
[108:09.00]You cross the plains once more.
[108:10.10]You continue to walk.
[108:14.84]We want to go up here, right?
[108:15.62]That's where she said to come meet her.
[108:20.91]Turn back time and when he's dead and take your stuff back.
[108:25.77]Ding.
[108:26.41]Ding.
[108:27.69]Rewind and zap six times.
[108:29.71]Once more you enter the shadow of the cliffs that surround this place.
[108:32.51]The sun lowers towards the horizon.
[108:34.25]Soon it will be dark.
[108:36.03]The grass meadow ends by the cliff base and a carved stone steps that lead away from the backlands.
[108:43.51]Climb the steps.
[108:45.03]You haul yourself onto the first of the gigantic steps that leads up the cliff face.
[108:50.85]Halfway up.
[108:53.45]You clamber up the carved rock, then about halfway up you pause to rest near the entrance to a cave.
[109:00.18]We're going right in.
[109:01.46]We are welcome guests.
[109:03.96]We are absolutely welcome guests.
[109:06.20]Into the cave.
[109:07.77]How are you?
[109:08.73]It's me.
[109:09.93]I'm here.
[109:10.89]I hope you don't mind me just coming in like this.
[109:14.80]okay where is she where are you welcome oh yeah that was the same voice murmurs a voice from the shadows at the far end of the space greetings you reply politely you hear footsteps padding forward over sand and then a shambling figure appears a woman with crazed white hair wearing rags of animal skin
[109:39.92]You, she says.
[109:41.13]I had no idea I would see you again.
[109:44.59]Her voice is familiar from somewhere, but you have not met anyone so old since the witch above the waterfall in Shumanari Hills.
[109:53.35]Oh, isn't this supposed to be the... I thought this was the lady with the eye on her head.
[110:02.36]Stay back.
[110:03.02]Yeah, but this is supposed to be... I thought this was the past.
[110:09.85]You got catfished.
[110:14.01]Do you know me?
[110:15.97]Of course, she replies.
[110:17.49]You've not changed a bit.
[110:19.33]When I was so young, I was rather in love with you, as I recall.
[110:23.80]With that, she steps forward once more, coming into the thin moonlight at the entrance of the cave.
[110:29.06]You gasp.
[110:30.08]Though this woman is old beyond imagining, you recognize her face.
[110:33.23]It is Elthera, with whom you were playing dice only hours before.
[110:39.98]I thought this was back in time.
[110:42.62]This is forward in time?
[110:47.79]Oh yeah, I know you.
[110:49.65]Poor stranger, she smiles.
[110:51.81]You must be very lost to still be here wandering these isles.
[110:56.27]So beautiful once, but poisoned now.
[111:00.01]How much time has passed?
[111:02.42]When we met, I was barely 16.
[111:05.52]Now, let me see.
[111:06.90]I suppose I am 113.
[111:10.59]If you don't count the ear, I was a eagle.
[111:14.35]Oh, Jesus.
[111:17.47]There's another 100 bucks.
[111:20.14]Damn, dude.
[111:21.92]He did it again.
[111:22.60]He's back.
[111:24.56]He did it again.
[111:29.06]Thanks a lot, man.
[111:31.88]500 billion dollars.
[111:36.10]Well, dodged a bullet.
[111:52.84]You guys are hilarious Don't count the year I spent as an eagle she's an animal too apparently But welcome all the same perhaps you are thirsty from a corner of the cave she produces a jug Which has been catching water dripping like this dripping down the stone a couple more Waffen for Jerma Rumble
[112:20.02]At this point, he's going to finance the next one.
[112:22.97]Seriously, dude.
[112:24.51]That's a lot of money.
[112:25.25]That's a lot of money to give somebody.
[112:29.29]So I... I... Thanks.
[112:32.47]I can't believe that you think I'm worth that much money.
[112:35.07]Thank you, dude.
[112:38.13]But welcome all the same, my thirsty... Yeah, I am thirsty.
[112:44.71]Fuck.
[112:45.61]That's another one.
[112:54.95]Dude, I hope you have a lot of expendable income.
[113:01.13]I hope you are like a secret billionaire.
[113:05.07]Because that's a lot of money.
[113:07.67]That's a lot.
[113:09.92]You are... Thank you.
[113:15.84]And we can't forget about the other bits.
[113:17.76]Minkfur with 100 bits.
[113:18.70]So many money.
[113:19.34]Thank you for the 100 bits.
[113:22.39]And then Derp Mayor also subscribed.
[113:23.81]A lot of it.
[113:24.41]If you're wondering why I turned off the subscription notification is because in the beginning of the stream, we were getting just bombarded with the Paul Bearer sound.
[113:34.10]And I kind of wanted to just have it be in the background while I read.
[113:36.84]Because it is hard to like read and then listen to Paul Bearer in my head.
[113:42.17]But yeah, I got that.
[113:43.65]Thanks, dude.
[113:44.69]Thanks to everybody.
[113:46.87]We're currently about to woo an old lady.
[113:51.79]Do you think I care that she's 113?
[113:56.81]She said she liked me.
[113:57.62]She said she was in love with me.
[114:00.04]I'm going to drink her water.
[114:01.90]She pours you a cup when you drink gratefully and quickly feel thoroughly refreshed.
[114:07.12]Ah.
[114:08.82]Alright, give me some tips.
[114:10.92]Okay, what do I say?
[114:11.78]What do I say to her?
[114:12.92]Okay, you know, I like your hair.
[114:14.72]It's been barely any time since I last met you.
[114:16.62]Yeah, that's a good one.
[114:18.40]Can you tell me about the seven serpents?
[114:19.72]No, that's too forward, too to the point.
[114:21.44]Do you have any provisions?
[114:22.80]No, food.
[114:23.65]Don't ask her about food.
[114:25.67]It's been so long since I last saw you.
[114:28.45]Then the curse on this land affects me, but not you, she says.
[114:32.53]Perhaps you will be able to leave unlike the others.
[114:37.11]What others?
[114:38.79]The others, all the others that survived the new crown, they wander the wilderness in circles, lost, endlessly repeating themselves.
[114:47.88]Wait, what?
[114:50.78]Hey, Termo, I wanted to ask you a question.
[114:54.02]What was the question?
[114:56.79]Is that the question?
[114:59.09]Well, I'll answer it for you.
[115:01.99]Yes.
[115:02.21]Yes.
[115:04.97]Uh, can you tell me about the seven serpents?
[115:07.66]I probably should ask her for food.
[115:11.10]The woman shakes her head.
[115:11.86]I do not eat.
[115:13.54]I sustain myself through passive thought.
[115:16.18]It is a pure existence.
[115:19.56]Dude, you gotta train me.
[115:21.10]You gotta train me.
[115:23.17]If you have 50 years to spend in practice...
[115:26.31]but I do not have so long, I fear.
[115:28.67]The woman coughs.
[115:29.89]You're a sorcerer, are you not?
[115:32.39]Yes, I am.
[115:33.79]She nods.
[115:34.57]There is a secret known only to the most powerful sorcerers in this land.
[115:39.04]The sorcerers of the fortress know it, I am sure, but they have tried to keep it secret.
[115:44.24]Would you like to hear it?
[115:47.04]Gonna get a fucking new spell?
[115:51.28]My name is Hugh Mungus.
[115:53.14]Love the channel.
[115:54.64]Thank you, Hugh Mungus.
[115:58.12]Who would want to leave when such a saucy grandma wants you?
[116:01.66]Alright, give me the new spell.
[116:05.26]She nods in return.
[116:06.28]It is said, you see, that sorcery is unstoppably powerful.
[116:09.99]The sorcerers tell us that magic controls the world's very warp and weft.
[116:13.97]That once woven, a spell cannot be unbound.
[116:17.23]The claim is bold, but I have learned it is also untrue.
[116:22.74]Magic can be undone.
[116:25.01]Magic, some magic, perhaps all magic, can be countered, just as the parrying blade can stop a sword.
[116:32.47]I have discovered one such counterspell already.
[116:35.61]The spell of healing opposes the spell of enchantment of the fireball.
[116:40.49]I believe if one can recognize the spell being cast and knows the form, then one can prevent that spell with the cast of the other.
[116:51.15]Learned a counterspell.
[116:52.69]Pretty sick.
[116:55.39]Let's try it.
[116:57.47]She nods.
[116:58.09]I hope in doing so you do not get yourself killed.
[117:00.98]Alright.
[117:02.90]What about the seven serpents?
[117:03.76]Give me some more.
[117:04.38]Give me some dirt.
[117:06.91]Seven serpents?
[117:08.59]Suddenly her face is alive with activity, and she hobbles back into the depths of her cave, returning a moment later, clicking her fingers.
[117:16.26]I have seen this.
[117:17.82]I have seen this in the stars.
[117:20.52]About seven serpents turns the fate of a man, and about that turns the fate of a world.
[117:26.22]But I thought the seven serpents were stars, she points up.
[117:30.45]Up there.
[117:33.39]Uh, seven serpents are real, lady.
[117:37.27]They are most powerful.
[117:39.55]They are all but... What am I doing?
[117:40.87]Okay, if you could see my camera, I'm, like, just dancing and snapping.
[117:44.72]Like, she's not doing this.
[117:46.02]She's not doing that anymore.
[117:48.00]They are all but indestructible.
[117:50.00]If you see one of these serpents, stranger, I believe you must run.
[117:53.86]Hey, I've killed tons of serpents.
[117:59.67]Not as these.
[118:01.34]Each of the seven serpents is sliced from the head of a hydra.
[118:04.68]Each is bound to an element of the world.
[118:07.00]To fire, or air, or Earth, or time.
[118:10.72]She waves a hand.
[118:12.21]That sort of thing.
[118:13.65]And each one only has one weakness.
[118:19.71]What weakness?
[118:21.66]a different weakness in each serpent.
[118:23.36]You must know them to kill them, but to know them is to be killed by them, she sakes her head.
[118:28.86]And the whole land turns on this, so the whole land must surely fall.
[118:33.55]The woman sits down quite suddenly in a state of some despair.
[118:38.03]Go to her.
[118:39.45]You approach her hoping to console her, but she does not react to your presence.
[118:43.63]She does not even blink.
[118:45.92]The woman murmurs softly to herself.
[118:50.24]What can I fucking take from her house?
[118:53.17]You glance around the cave.
[118:54.39]Elthera has few possessions to speak of, but your interest is taken more by the dust that covers the floor.
[118:59.81]Stone dust can be very valuable for magic.
[119:04.41]Gather up some dust.
[119:06.61]You scrape together a handful's worth of stone dust between your palms and slip it into your money pouch for safekeeping.
[119:12.61]The woman's third eye seems to glow momentarily.
[119:17.01]That sort of thing.
[119:22.98]Yeah, and all that sort of stuff.
[119:25.48]You step away from the old woman and look about for where to go next.
[119:28.40]Then quite suddenly, she grabs your leg.
[119:31.70]I will find them, she hisses, but it will take some time to search.
[119:37.12]Come back.
[119:42.80]That is not... Then her eyes roll up into her skull.
[119:55.73]Okay, lady.
[119:56.79]Well, I really thought we were gonna get along.
[120:00.28]Oh, jeez.
[120:04.56]Thanks for the 500 bits, cookie!
[120:08.12]Zapper.
[120:09.11]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[120:11.15]No.
[120:11.69]Keep going.
[120:11.99]Deeper in the cave.
[120:13.31]She's got stuff.
[120:17.41]Stepping carefully past the catatonic woman, you make your way further into the back of the cave.
[120:22.25]After a narrow passage, it opens out to reveal a wide space lit by torchlight.
[120:27.11]The walls are covered with scratched writing, curious symbols and glyphs, all in the same shaky hand.
[120:33.68]A tangle of rope lies in one corner.
[120:36.80]A little dust trickles from the ceiling.
[120:41.32]Let's look at the glyphs.
[120:43.86]Intrigued by the writing, you look over some symbols.
[120:46.95]They are a mixture of star signs, letters, numbers, and shapes you do not recognize.
[120:51.40]There is no order.
[120:53.68]It is as though their scribe them was desperately... There's some spelling.
[121:01.85]There's some grammatical problems.
[121:03.91]I'm trying my best.
[121:05.92]It is as though a scribe, the person who scribed them, was desperately trying to capture as much as possible of a dream before it was forgotten.
[121:14.41]The results are quite indecipherable, especially in the near darkness, and barely any space is left.
[121:19.89]Only one panch of blank stone near the base of the wall.
[121:26.02]Some of the glyphs on the walls are split, you notice, by crazed cracks in the stone.
[121:30.40]There are some spellering problems there.
[121:37.23]Let's see what we can do.
[121:50.18]Oh, it's sad.
[121:53.06]I think I just got, yeah.
[121:55.06]Turn to stone.
[121:58.35]Why would I want to turn to stone right now?
[122:02.32]I don't think that's very... Not a good idea.
[122:13.15]Summon darkness?
[122:13.95]It's already dark.
[122:23.58]Cray light.
[122:24.58]I don't have a sun jewel.
[122:29.40]Zapper and then give us a face cam you coward Well, thank you rip Dark Souls 2 for the 1500 bits.
[122:36.84]Thanks a lot, dude 15 1500 buckaroonies So let's sense danger in here, I'm curious You bind the starlight into shape around you but the convoys you were expecting does not appear
[122:56.43]Instead, Lorag's mean and miserable tones fill your mind.
[123:01.56]Sadly, this place is quite safe.
[123:04.66]He complains.
[123:05.38]Oh, wow.
[123:07.92]That's awesome.
[123:09.50]I am so glad that Lorag is now going to be saying this every time I do Sense Darkness.
[123:15.61]Or Sense Darkness.
[123:17.99]Sense Darkness.
[123:19.77]Sense Danger.
[123:23.07]What else can I do?
[123:25.87]Whoa, that was weird.
[123:26.61]That piece just flew out of nowhere.
[123:33.17]Why would they want me to turn the stone in here?
[123:36.63]What about how?
[123:39.17]You weave the enchantment and once again Lorag replies, Trapped, are you?
[123:44.89]In a cave with one door.
[123:57.16]Sense darkness.
[123:58.76]Yeah, it's dark.
[124:05.89]That's fucking funny.
[124:09.11]Oh, no, it might be dark in here.
[124:10.85]I think I might need to sense darkness.
[124:14.25]S-U-D, sense darkness.
[124:17.07]Yeah, it is.
[124:17.69]It's pretty dark in here.
[124:22.22]Oh, that's fucking awesome.
[124:30.97]That's fucking fantastic.
[124:32.97]Look at the ropes.
[124:34.95]You go over to the bundle of rope and unravel it to discover it is in fact a sturdy rope ladder.
[124:39.25]You bundle it up and put it in your pack.
[124:41.25]Hey, cool.
[124:45.63]Sense Lorag.
[124:50.23]You weave the enchantment around you and it finishes with a grand finale.
[124:53.17]Yeah, it's dark in here.
[124:55.73]You turn your attention.
[124:56.41]I'm spending so much time in this fucking old lady's cave.
[125:01.49]What am I doing in here?
[125:04.51]Seriously, she's like sitting in the other room in a catatonic state.
[125:11.04]And I'm just fucking dicking around in her back room.
[125:14.62]I'm in like her office right now.
[125:17.75]You turn your attention to the cracks in the walls themselves.
[125:20.47]It is as though the cliff itself is slowly shearing apart.
[125:24.11]One crack in particular spiders the ceiling and threatens to bring down the roof.
[125:29.36]Looking more closely, you see why.
[125:30.82]It is filled with a seam of some soft metal which is slowly wearing away.
[125:40.15]Dig out the metal seam.
[125:42.20]You dig at the metal seam with your sword.
[125:44.14]It is worthless tin and comes away easily.
[125:46.92]There is a noise like rumbling thunder.
[125:49.12]The stones above shift perceptively.
[125:51.96]Quickly, you put your sword away before you bring the rocks down on your head.
[125:55.25]You're telling me this lady had a tin can in the ceiling and that was what was holding it up?
[126:07.01]You squat down to look at the blank stone, but see nothing.
[126:10.55]It is natural rock, only remarkable because every other surface has been etched or carved.
[126:15.16]Above the blank section is drawn a rude outline of a snake, followed by a hand and two vertical lines.
[126:23.21]There's nothing else I can do in here?
[126:27.43]I gotta sense darkness.
[126:32.35]I gotta summon darkness!
[126:35.58]Consulting the constellations above, you bind the spell and billows of black smoke emerge quickly from under your cloak.
[126:41.72]The back of the cave plunges into thick darkness, the torch on the wall disappearing completely from view.
[126:48.68]Wait.
[126:49.59]You wait, and after a few minutes the spell fade and fog dissipates.
[126:55.09]First I had to sense the darkness, and then I had to fucking summon the darkness, and then I had to sense to make sure the darkness was that I just summoned was in the darkness, and I sensed the darkness.
[127:04.20]Use rock, use rock, use rock, use rock?
[127:11.56]You want me to... No, that's such a... Is that going to be a waste?
[127:18.65]Use rock, use rock.
[127:19.59]Why does everybody want me to do rock?
[127:24.15]These are all just useless spells.
[127:25.51]I'm not going to waste rock in here.
[127:28.25]That could be useful.
[127:32.31]See the future.
[127:33.13]Damn it, I wish I had an orb.
[127:36.65]No.
[127:36.95]Goodbye.
[127:37.45]Goodbye.
[127:38.07]Goodbye.
[127:38.37]Leave the cave.
[127:39.33]Get me the fuck out of here.
[127:40.74]I've spent like 20 minutes in this fucking lady's dirty bed.
[127:46.38]You return from the rear of the cave.
[127:48.00]Elthera is still here, squatting in one corner and rocking quietly.
[127:53.99]It's kind of creepy.
[127:54.85]Ask her about the glyphs.
[127:56.73]Hey, what do those symbols on the wall mean?
[127:59.93]She shakes.
[128:00.41]She shakes.
[128:02.44]Too much to see.
[128:04.00]Not enough space.
[128:05.44]Too much to see.
[128:06.16]Oh, okay.
[128:09.82]You have a good day.
[128:12.20]You crazy old fucking Looney Tune.
[128:17.00]You step out of the cave on the stairs.
[128:19.16]The view below is quite giddy-ing.
[128:20.68]You are one step from plunging to the pit floor.
[128:25.02]Move on.
[128:26.14]The steps continue both directions, otherwise you could return to the cave.
[128:32.01]Her hard drive is full.
[128:33.15]Let's just go down.
[128:41.57]You've reached the bottom of the cliff.
[128:42.71]Darkness closes in.
[128:45.33]You need to rest, especially after so long walking with an empty belly.
[128:49.72]The grass meadow ends by the cliff base and the carved stone steps that lead away from the backlands.
[128:56.18]You're a fantastic adventurer.
[128:58.28]Well, thank you, Aeroless.
[129:01.14]We're going to rest here.
[129:03.33]It's not like that lady's going to come out and fucking attack me.
[129:06.27]You find an old foxhole and scramble inside.
[129:09.29]You've not yet eaten today, but you have no rations to ease your hunger.
[129:12.53]Close your eyes.
[129:15.09]You stretch out and rest.
[129:16.35]You are protected here, and your rest is untroubled by dreams.
[129:20.60]Sleep will not heal you if you have not eaten.
[129:23.84]You gain significant stamina, lost some gold, and met Shadrach the Hermit.
[129:30.48]All in one day.
[129:34.13]You pull yourself out of your hole and stand up.
[129:37.05]The grass meadow ends by the cliff base and the carved stone steps that lead away from the back lands.
[129:41.05]Yes, I just said that.
[129:42.11]Let's go.
[129:44.05]Alright.
[129:44.99]So we can either go follow along the cliff, the old road.
[129:48.79]I'm kind of running out of the... I need to turn this.
[129:53.19]We need to go back to the tower here and turn.
[130:00.75]Although I didn't go this way.
[130:01.81]No, I'm going to go this way because I didn't go this way originally.
[130:05.06]And this is not a different time.
[130:15.30]I posted this a week ago.
[130:16.17]I haven't had a solid poop since.
[130:17.89]Oh, that's not good.
[130:21.37]Alright, let's keep going.
[130:26.91]You walk away from the cliff across the waste.
[130:30.65]The air moves a little.
[130:32.20]Still icy, but fresh.
[130:33.88]From here, the path is uncertain.
[130:36.62]Baodabak is a wasteland and there's no pass through the great ridge that forms its eastern border.
[130:43.84]The forest of Snata is uncharted.
[130:46.38]To the east of the ridge is uncharted, as you have seen.
[130:50.41]And the Cladabak steps are said to be home only to under-evolved half-humans.
[130:56.78]You can't go to the horns.
[130:57.98]No tracks climb the horns of Ilcala that lie beyond the forest, and there is no bridge across the Great Lake beyond that.
[131:06.70]There may be no road at all.
[131:08.53]When the archmage sent his birdmen to steal the crown of kings, they flew.
[131:13.56]But you gotta walk.
[131:15.26]The path beckons.
[131:16.40]There is no alternative.
[131:17.50]The future of the old world depends on you finding your way across this lonely dust bowl.
[131:21.53]The sunlight turns the dust of the plain to a bitter yellow.
[131:24.61]As you walk, you come across an open area dotted with 20 or 30 small holes.
[131:35.34]No!
[131:36.30]Oh no!
[131:36.72]A stream's dying again!
[131:37.96]No way!
[131:39.64]Nooo!
[131:49.65]I'm gonna, I'm gonna let it do its thing.
[131:52.17]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna let it do its thing.
[131:53.33]I don't know if you, can anybody hear me?
[131:54.73]Well, I'm staying here.
[131:55.95]I ain't going anywhere.
[131:59.61]I ain't going anywhere.
[132:03.44]No way.
[132:06.90]We, we'll sit here.
[132:07.82]I will sit here for like, I'll sit here for like 20 minutes.
[132:16.69]It's jumping, it's jumping all over the place.
[132:22.98]No decision is permanent.
[132:33.39]I was gonna give you a billion bucks.
[133:07.33]Again, I'm waiting.
[133:42.85]Yeah, I'm just I'm sitting there.
[133:44.51]I'm just gonna sit here.
[133:48.70]If you guys can hear me, you can hear me.
[133:50.40]We're gonna ride this one up.
[134:01.32]You guys see any good movies?
[134:08.12]Am I still live?
[134:09.46]Like am I I'm still live, right?
[134:12.28]You guys can sometimes like intermittently hear me talk.
[134:17.10]Ride the wave.
[134:18.86]Ride the wave.
[134:47.66]You just got to ride the wave.
[135:08.87]No decision is permanent.
[135:25.84]Yeah, this hasn't happened in a while.
[135:29.87]Oh my god, I just got bits.
[135:34.12]I just got some bits.
