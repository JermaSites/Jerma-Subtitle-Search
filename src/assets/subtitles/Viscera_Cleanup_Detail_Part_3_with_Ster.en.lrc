[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.02]Hi guys, how are you?
[00:06.19]Good to see you again.
[00:08.83]My name is Jerma.
[00:10.73]I'm here to present a stream for you all today.
[00:16.40]A little late today, but that's because we had a couple of different small issues, and by small I mean MAJOR issues.
[00:23.20]Issue number one, earlier, about like an hour and a half ago, my internet was off.
[00:28.27]It was shutting off and turning on, shutting off and turning on, and I'm like, what the heck's going on here?
[00:32.49]So I had to figure that out.
[00:34.41]Issue number two, we're gonna play, when I say we, Star is here.
[00:39.34]He's muted though, you can't hear him.
[00:43.48]Star and I were gonna play Executive Assault 2.
[00:46.66]And wow, that sounds like a fun idea.
[00:47.82]Let's go ahead and do that.
[00:48.46]Let's jump into multiplayer in Executive Assault 1, the CEO game with the first person RTS.
[00:55.22]The game crashed every time we tried to do it.
[00:58.26]We would get into a multiplayer game, we would try to figure it out.
[01:00.41]Crash.
[01:01.49]Crash.
[01:02.51]Crash.
[01:03.65]So after it happening a few times, we were just like, uh, let's do something else.
[01:10.73]And that something else is a visceral cleanup detail.
[01:12.97]Star has never played it, so we're going to have to teach him how to play it.
[01:19.49]And here they are now.
[01:20.43]Oh!
[01:22.27]Yeah, so we're talking about how I'm going to have to teach you how to play visceral cleanup detail.
[01:27.83]Yeah.
[01:28.31]He's never played this before.
[01:29.19]He thinks that I've never worked a day in my life that my hands are uncalloused, that I've never even held a mop before.
[01:34.64]I need to teach you how to use a mop, he says.
[01:37.48]That's true, though.
[01:41.06]Have you worked a job?
[01:42.62]That's not true.
[01:43.84]I've mopped before.
[01:45.79]For work?
[01:47.11]Yes.
[01:48.75]Hmm.
[01:49.73]I have.
[01:51.94]Okay.
[01:53.00]Alright, okay.
[01:53.94]I thought that you were just, I thought you didn't have one of those.
[01:56.32]I thought, okay.
[01:57.12]I didn't know you had one.
[01:58.66]Okay, you just thought I was lying to you.
[02:01.66]I guess, I guess you had a job before.
[02:03.32]I guess.
[02:06.03]I guess you've had to do, like, nightly detail work before.
[02:10.11]Yeah, so do I, do you still need to explain this to me?
[02:12.47]I can't, okay, what was the last, I'm curious, when was the last time you held a mop in your hand?
[02:17.79]Um...
[02:19.98]it might have been eight years ago really yeah I don't know a long maybe like six actually I don't know if that's true I'm talking like you don't have to do any cleaning but when was the last time you held a mop in both of your hands yeah like probably six years ago okay for me for me it was like two weeks ago so okay I think I have some authority to teach you how to play
[02:44.64]And I think I just went to zero.
[02:46.62]No, thank God.
[02:48.28]I hear your voice going... It's going to be a struggle today.
[02:53.90]It's going to be a struggle today, guys.
[02:55.41]But we're going to... I'm going for it.
[02:58.45]It's going to be a struggle.
[03:02.19]Alright.
[03:03.31]So, more importantly, let's just get in the game because we're already in the game.
[03:07.83]We already spent the time getting into the game.
[03:10.61]I'm trying to touch your face and I can't.
[03:13.39]Hold on a second here.
[03:16.69]there is that star this is me I'm on this side you're you're purple yeah I'm lagging right now yeah I think uh is my my graphics up too high that's what it is alright so let's talk what do you know about um cleaning
[03:39.38]Uh, you dip the mop in the thing, and then you mop the stuff.
[03:43.95]Okay, wrong.
[03:44.57]First of all, you have to clean up your area.
[03:47.01]So, these boxes here become overrated.
[03:49.53]Remember, he's never played this game.
[03:51.45]So, hold left-click.
[03:54.48]Oh, you don't have to hold it, you just click it.
[03:55.62]If you want to tilt it around, you hold left click and move it around in a circle with your mouse.
[04:00.86]Right, you can tilt it around this way.
[04:02.74]If you press, uh, what button is it that you press to make it so it stands upright?
[04:07.42]It is not T. Uh, what is it?
[04:10.44]How do I make it just stand upright?
[04:11.70]What's the button?
[04:12.40]Oh yeah, this is the guy teaching me.
[04:14.74]I don't know what the button is.
[04:20.39]What's the button?
[04:21.09]F?
[04:22.02]No.
[04:23.10]No, people are saying F because of the internet.
[04:25.16]Q. It's not Q. Double click?
[04:29.48]Double, alright, so what you're going to do is you're going to double, if you pick something up, you're going to double click.
[04:32.80]If you want it to stand upright.
[04:34.30]Right click, drop stuff.
[04:35.96]Everything is physics based, by the way, so be aware of that when you're cleaning.
[04:41.55]So we need to, these are the boxes that you have to put the trash in.
[04:46.17]And when I say trash, follow me up the stairs.
[04:51.09]Watch out for that.
[04:52.79]So in here, as we open this door, you're going to see... Well, this looks pretty clean.
[04:59.36]This is actually a clean house.
[05:00.42]I did not think this was going to be clean.
[05:02.04]Over here on the... Okay, never mind.
[05:03.44]So over here on the left, you see that there's been a couple of murders.
[05:08.50]Okay.
[05:09.24]And we need to pick up the whole... The whole entire house has to be clean before we clock in.
[05:14.95]I have an idea.
[05:17.08]You have to listen.
[05:18.24]No, you don't get ideas.
[05:20.16]This is my job.
[05:21.48]Okay.
[05:22.12]The rest of the house looks pretty good.
[05:23.46]So what if we just wallpapered over the rest of this and just that room was back there.
[05:30.37]You want to just build a wall here.
[05:33.21]Yeah.
[05:33.71]But what happens to the, this part of the house, this is, you just can't go in this part of the house anymore.
[05:39.39]Oh, we can like clean the front porch.
[05:40.79]Cause once we sell it, we're good.
[05:46.24]Yeah, but they're going to want to see the kitchen and shit.
[05:48.78]How are you going to convince them to... Yes, your understanding.
[05:53.36]So, we have to... Just wait.
[05:56.30]I wasn't done explaining.
[05:57.14]So, we have to clean up everything.
[05:58.23]We have to rearrange everything.
[05:59.23]It has to be spotless.
[06:02.41]There is an incinerator.
[06:05.15]Somewhere.
[06:06.21]I have no idea where.
[06:07.67]Okay, is the meat grinder part of the cleaning or is that the horror?
[06:11.49]Have I ever seen this before?
[06:15.73]okay I think I think that works oh I can't pick you up that's too bad hey there's no incinerator on this level you so we have to put you have to pick up the things and throw them in there okay what are we putting in that original bucket okay so come over here as you can see this is the slosh-o-matic this is a machine and when you press the button it comes out with a fresh bucket of water where are you I'm right behind you
[06:43.42]Grab the bucket of water.
[06:44.48]Don't spill it.
[06:45.45]I get made fun of for that.
[06:47.03]It is very easily spillable.
[06:49.27]You're gonna take your... I couldn't do it.
[06:54.74]How did you... Really?
[06:59.82]Okay, well, just be careful with these.
[07:01.68]They're very easily spillable.
[07:04.42]Very easy.
[07:05.18]I don't know why it was not spillable.
[07:07.74]So you need to take this and obviously bring it.
[07:10.32]Let's start over here.
[07:11.64]Get a couple of buckets.
[07:12.32]I'm getting my own.
[07:13.22]Yeah, get your own bucket.
[07:14.04]Take out your mop.
[07:16.44]Now your mop can only be used a certain amount of times.
[07:19.18]So take a look down here.
[07:20.70]See how that's doing that?
[07:22.08]It's cleaning it up.
[07:23.34]Your mop is going to get dirty.
[07:26.00]Watch your footprints.
[07:26.72]Don't walk through stuff.
[07:29.76]And once it becomes too dirty, if you keep mopping, you're going to make a fucking mess.
[07:34.29]Don't do that.
[07:34.95]Come over to your water.
[07:36.81]And dash it, dash it.
[07:38.67]Like that.
[07:39.23]Clean it up.
[07:39.79]And then you get to use it a little bit more.
[07:44.30]By the way, when you get to a point where you've done this a few times, the water is going to get dirty.
[07:51.16]And you're going to have to dispose of that bucket because you can't use it anymore.
[07:55.02]Oh, let me just grind this person up.
[07:57.37]Yeah, hold on.
[07:58.13]Hold on.
[07:59.13]This is my first day on the job.
[08:00.33]Thanks for training me.
[08:03.75]So, you gotta pick that up with your hands.
[08:07.82]And... And then clean it.
[08:10.12]No, no, no, no.
[08:10.84]Well, now you've ruined that bucket.
[08:12.20]So, you've already screwed it up.
[08:13.38]See how the bucket's ruined now?
[08:15.20]Okay.
[08:16.06]So, now the head's clean.
[08:17.02]Let's just do... Let's put this in here.
[08:21.10]Okay.
[08:21.74]So, we make... Once there's a big mess over here, you start to clean it up.
[08:26.37]Alright.
[08:27.05]So, do you have a basic understanding of how we're doing this?
[08:30.27]Yeah, I'm tracking blood everywhere.
[08:31.83]Yeah, so you stop doing that.
[08:33.57]By the way, this is... Happy Halloween, everybody.
[08:35.57]Happy Halloween.
[08:36.21]I don't know why we started with... By the way, we thought we would do something festive for a change.
[08:40.11]Yeah.
[08:40.43]Let me just tell you something right now.
[08:41.69]This map is supposed to take four hours.
[08:45.74]Estimated.
[08:46.32]So, strap in.
[08:48.58]Is this like a gamer equivalent of doing like a thousand piece puzzle?
[08:54.84]Yeah.
[08:55.10]Except...
[08:56.37]You don't have to really think where the pieces go.
[08:58.93]You just... I mean, I guess.
[09:03.32]Oh, by the way, get these USB drives.
[09:05.68]Hold on to them.
[09:07.70]Why?
[09:08.14]Because they give you extra points at the end.
[09:09.88]You put them in the computer.
[09:11.84]Okay.
[09:12.42]Okay, so we have to... I need a designated area.
[09:17.27]Think of a desert because we don't want to lose these.
[09:18.67]So designated area for these are going to be over here.
[09:21.53]Yeah, just drop them like right here.
[09:23.29]If you find a green USB drive.
[09:26.35]Alright, well, I need a bucket of water.
[09:27.68]Where's that bucket of water?
[09:28.48]There it is.
[09:28.82]I'm going to bring this upstairs.
[09:32.10]So do you want to work together or do you want to change rooms?
[09:35.24]I don't know.
[09:39.73]This is going to fall.

[17:36.07]You need to see this.
[17:37.29]I'm coming.
[17:41.82]Alright, so.
[17:43.40]Over here, this green stand-up display box thing.
[17:47.54]You click it, and it gives you one of these.
[17:49.82]It's so much easier just to clean a room by putting shit in here first.
[17:54.28]And then taking that out, and putting it outside, and disposing of it later.
[17:58.61]You understand?
[17:59.73]So, what I like to do, is I like to grab two of them.
[18:03.35]Or three of them.
[18:05.41]Stack them up on top of each other, and bring like two into wherever you're cleaning.
[18:09.50]You feel what I'm saying?
[18:10.80]Okay, yeah.
[18:16.70]Oh, by the way, holding down shift is walk.
[18:18.61]It's your best friend.
[18:21.91]Okay, so we're going to go clean those two rooms.
[18:24.09]Yes.
[18:30.71]What was that Flintstones thing?
[18:40.66]Oh, no, I know what that is.
[18:41.46]Stack.
[18:45.56]Stack.
[18:49.14]Where are the stairs?
[18:53.36]Where are the stairs?
[18:55.56]Are you serious?
[18:56.66]I don't remember the stairs.
[18:58.12]Back right here.
[19:01.54]Alright.
[19:06.75]I got that.
[19:07.93]Now you're gonna want some buckets.
[19:14.75]There's already been a fucking mess.
[19:18.35]The buckets count as trash too, though.
[19:20.13]Stack them and get rid of them.
[19:22.35]I recommend stacking them one by one into each other and grabbing the bottom bucket.
[19:26.55]You could also do that when they have liquid in them, but you have to be careful.
[19:30.60]I'd like to do at least four or five.
[19:33.20]Do you really like to do this?
[19:35.92]What are you talking about?
[19:41.30]I'm talking about, like, you have some free time, you just like hanging out and cleaning.
[19:49.56]Yeah.
[19:50.76]Yeah.
[19:52.40]What?
[19:52.66]Yeah.
[19:55.93]Stop!
[20:03.37]You're doing a great job.
[20:05.85]Just do it!
[20:07.93]Oh, no.
[20:08.93]I'm good.
[20:10.94]Oh, by the way, be careful because sometimes you might get a troll.
[20:17.22]Bill.
[20:19.53]Stop, please!
[20:25.71]You get your own.
[20:26.62]You have your own room to do upstairs, so get your own.
[20:31.54]No, bring more than one!
[20:32.58]He's an idiot!
[20:33.70]He's an idiot!
[20:34.96]I'm the idiot.
[20:36.16]He's an idiot.
[20:36.66]He doesn't understand.
[20:37.26]You're on, like, your fourth spill.
[20:39.89]Oh, I wonder why that is.
[20:40.79]Maybe it's because somebody keeps taking them and throwing them into the trash behind me.
[20:44.25]I only need one.
[20:46.11]He's an idiot.
[20:47.25]He doesn't even know.
[21:03.97]Where is he?
[21:05.45]I don't like how quiet it is.
[21:06.66]I can hear him, like, walking around.
[21:07.90]Oh, are you starting?
[21:10.16]Uh... I guess.
[21:11.84]Okay, just wait.
[21:12.48]We have to do a three, two, one countdown.
[21:15.32]I almost just dropped all this.
[21:17.06]Okay.
[21:19.39]Stop!
[21:19.87]Why is it doing that?
[21:22.27]Why is it doing that?
[21:23.19]Guys, why is it doing that?
[21:27.63]Is this too big to go in the door?
[21:30.20]The hell?
[21:33.07]Oh, fuck.
[21:33.71]Okay.
[21:34.27]Why are you leaving doors open?
[21:43.43]That's your issue?
[21:46.09]There's blood all over every wall.
[21:47.41]Why are the doors open?
[21:50.51]You're gonna get a draft.
[21:51.99]You gave me like a Nickelodeon guts staircase to go up, by the way.
[21:55.49]Thank you.
[21:59.03]Can you move that chair, please?
[22:03.23]Can you move this stuff for me, please?
[22:05.18]Ow!
[22:05.66]Ow, my mouth!
[22:07.08]Not funny!
[22:07.94]Time out, time out, time out, my mouth!
[22:10.10]Time out, I'm bleeding.
[22:11.12]I'm moving, I'm moving.
[22:11.92]What the fuck?
[22:13.42]It was funny until you- I gotta go to the hospital, dude.
[22:21.37]Did you move everything?
[22:23.95]Yeah.
[22:24.83]It's just- Oh my fucking god.
[22:26.31]Take the one on top, please.
[22:28.65]Just take the one out of the top.
[22:31.47]Thanks.
[22:32.21]Server reaching net actor saturation.
[22:36.25]Uh-oh.
[22:36.99]What does that mean?
[22:38.45]We're about to be oversaturated.
[22:40.17]We're oversaturated.
[22:43.47]Server reaching oversaturated levels.
[22:47.69]Alright, are you ready to start cleaning?
[22:50.49]Yeah.
[22:50.65]Okay.
[22:50.93]Let's see whose method's better.
[22:55.36]Okay, so on the count of...
[23:12.22]On the count of three.
[23:18.61]Hold on.
[23:19.81]I'm not ready to count yet.
[23:21.55]This is oversaturated.
[23:24.87]Okay.
[23:25.61]On the count of... Get out of here.
[23:27.95]You've done enough.
[23:29.23]Okay.
[23:35.56]Are you counting?
[23:36.30]I'm not ready to count yet.
[23:37.06]Hold on.
[23:38.17]You're cleaning already.
[23:39.05]I'm not cleaning yet, I promise.
[23:40.05]Look at this room.
[23:41.17]Okay, ready?
[23:42.49]No, I'm not giving you another viewer.
[23:43.87]Okay, one... Earn it.
[23:46.23]One, two, start cleaning.
[23:49.39]Okay.
[23:59.57]You got any music?
[24:00.73]What?
[24:00.91]No, I have to play that.
[24:02.83]Isn't there a radio in the game?
[24:04.39]There is a radio in the game, but it doesn't really work that well.
[24:10.45]Oh.
[24:14.50]Are you allowed to listen to music?
[24:16.52]Uh, maybe.
[24:17.78]Am I?
[24:18.00]Did your mommy say you could?
[24:19.68]Did you take my- Take your what?
[24:23.71]Nothing.
[24:25.01]Okay.
[24:40.56]What the fuck was that?
[24:43.94]Is that you doing that or is that the game doing that?
[24:46.95]That's the horror mansion doing that.
[24:48.55]Is that the horror mansion?
[24:50.11]Yeah.
[24:52.87]Fuck, too many actors.
[25:18.37]Can you clean up some of these actors, please?
[25:21.20]I'm doing it.
[25:21.86]Okay.
[25:51.87]I'm sorry.
[25:52.93]Did you not use that word?
[25:57.12]I just said dastardly.
[25:59.42]I'm sorry.
[26:00.56]I'm just having a fun time.
[26:06.94]I wish I had the candle in here and it's too dark.
[26:08.48]It really is.
[26:08.94]Are you serious?
[26:11.54]I just need candle.
[26:12.26]I like the candle.
[26:21.76]How you doing?
[26:22.12]You doing okay?
[26:23.16]How are you?
[26:23.56]Like halfway?
[26:24.02]Yeah, I'm getting there.
[26:27.32]I think maybe I should have got more buckets.
[26:30.84]Yeah, I told you.
[26:39.41]I'm trying to get this as clean as possible.
[26:55.30]Clean, clean, clean.
[26:57.32]Now, remember, what matters is to be valid.
[27:01.57]Your room has to be completely empty.
[27:03.85]No, like, trash cans.
[27:05.99]No... What if this stuff, like, belongs there?
[27:07.79]Like, there's books and stuff?
[27:09.37]I mean, the books are fine, but no, like, trash.
[27:11.53]And no buckets and no... It has to be out of the room.
[27:14.41]It has to be a completely clean room.
[27:16.99]Okay.
[27:19.08]And we'll have some, like, a chat inspection.
[27:41.99]I'm not in a game.
[27:43.30]No.
[27:45.62]Alright, well, you try to host this time.
[27:48.04]Damn it.
[27:54.10]Hold on.
[27:55.78]I put in so much work.
[27:57.20]I did too.
[27:57.98]You don't know how much work I put in.
[28:04.63]God damn it.
[28:05.33]Okay, hold on.
[28:06.87]I'm setting up the host.
[28:07.95]Maybe I can actually do it this time.
[28:12.75]Oh wait, I'm in like the normal game now.
[28:15.07]It like kicked me to the normal game.
[28:17.03]Oh, you got in the normal game?
[28:19.33]Oh my God, do I have... Your stream restarted and it was playing on my stream.
[28:24.76]It was, wait, what?
[28:26.92]Forget about, just don't even talk to me.
[28:28.56]Alright, I'm gonna go like this.
[28:33.74]And I'm gonna go like this.
[28:36.62]And it's gonna be really fun in like another 20 minutes when I go to zero again.
[28:41.45]Okay.
[28:42.11]Well, I'm hosting it.
[28:43.47]I'm in the game.
[28:45.63]Wait.
[28:46.43]Frick.
[28:46.75]Hold on.
[28:47.93]I'm not hosting it.
[28:49.68]I closed the game.
[28:51.08]This is too hard.
[28:51.94]The cleaning was easy.
[28:53.86]Cleaning was easy.
[28:54.98]This is hard.
[28:56.14]I'm going to zero again, I think.
[29:00.88]No.
[29:01.70]Why?
[29:02.66]Why?
[29:03.10]If you can't clean it, just call it off.
[29:06.04]No, I can't call it off.
[29:15.76]Just admit that I win, and we can move on.
[29:17.98]I'm not going to admit.
[29:19.20]We can reschedule.
[29:20.26]We can do something else.
[29:22.56]Alright, let's try it one more time.
[29:26.44]Alright, you got a game?
[29:38.51]Okay, hold on.
[29:40.11]I'm fuming right now.
[29:42.33]Oh, I'm fuming right now.
[29:45.22]Okay, I'm in.
[29:46.20]I think I invite you.
[29:48.84]Dude, I don't know.
[29:49.72]I've never used a computer before.
[29:52.86]The mic's still on?
[29:56.91]I know I'm live right now.
[30:04.87]We'll try it again.
[30:08.37]We'll see what happens.
[30:10.05]Oh yeah, well now we both know how this works.
[30:15.73]You know, it's fair.
[30:16.91]It's hilarious because you want to know something?
[30:25.28]I just got murdered.
[30:27.20]Why?
[30:29.62]Um, I was gonna say something funny.
[30:31.34]Not funny, actually.
[30:32.34]Uh, the funny thing is they did a hardware node upgrade.
[30:36.86]They did, like, hardware maintenance.
[30:40.32]Like, upgraded the node.
[30:42.18]And it's worse than ever before.
[30:44.98]Holy shit.
[30:46.95]What are... What are you saying?
[30:48.51]Holy shit, like, fucking the internet's stupid.
[30:53.21]Okay, um, anyways.
[30:54.87]Uh, you got a game?
[30:55.75]I'm coming in.
[30:56.27]Yeah.
[30:59.60]Let's see if this works.
[31:00.54]Let's see if I can stay connected for more than a minute.
[31:04.14]Oh, did you put the password in the, uh, in our DM here?
[31:08.43]Uh, it's the same one from the other game.
[31:16.01]We tried to play another game before this, and my computer, like, restarted.
[31:21.75]And then it crashed to desktop the second time.
[31:24.79]So, so far, you know, playing games with Jerma, a lot of fun!
[31:29.08]It's going pretty good.
[31:31.10]It is fun, isn't it?
[31:33.25]Fucking God.
[31:34.05]Alright.
[31:40.35]Hey, okay.
[31:41.49]So, well, would you look?
[31:44.25]Okay, so here's how you play.
[31:45.41]It's funny.
[31:45.87]Here's what you do.
[31:46.97]You go over here.
[31:48.79]Shut up.
[31:50.74]And there's, you pick it up, you press, you can rotate it.
[31:54.30]What does this thing do?
[31:57.02]It's a smell machine.
[31:57.84]It tells you what... When you turn it on and you point it around, it'll tell you specifically what direction is still trash.
[32:06.46]You can change the mode if you right-click.
[32:10.27]One of them is blood and body parts.
[32:12.21]The other one is trash.
[32:14.03]And it kind of beeps the closer you get.
[32:15.81]Okay.
[32:18.31]That's great news.
[32:19.41]Yeah, it is.
[32:20.41]You are not going to get that same room again because we both know it was already clean.
[32:25.08]Yeah, I know.
[32:29.59]Yeah, I know.
[32:33.01]It was fun.
[32:36.85]So how about you get the room that I had with the bed and I'll do the basement?
[32:44.02]You think you can do that?
[32:45.66]Yeah.
[32:47.20]I'll just do you one higher.
[32:48.26]I'll do the living room.
[32:51.00]I'll do the whole living room.
[32:51.68]This would be completely spotless.
[32:54.27]I think the other room was worse because it's upstairs and you got to walk all the way up there.
[32:59.90]Hmm.
[33:00.48]Is that not fair?
[33:02.80]Okay.
[33:03.24]Yeah.
[33:03.86]Yeah.
[33:04.74]You get my old room.
[33:05.96]I get basement.
[33:06.74]You're the one that had like the bed with the blood and the Freddy Krueger hand?
[33:10.57]Yeah.
[33:10.77]Alright.
[33:11.57]You got it.
[33:13.89]Get situated.
[33:14.69]Get ready.
[33:15.07]Okay.
[33:17.43]And I'm not gonna like close the game when I'm embarrassed about my room or anything.
[33:28.62]Okay, and to be clear, I'm only doing the... There's like two rooms down here.
[33:35.21]I'm only doing the actual basement.
[33:36.67]Why did that cause more... Not this, like... No, just do the actual basement.
[33:40.85]I'll do your old room.
[33:43.09]Why am I loading in more stuff?
[33:46.43]Okay, I know what room is yours.
[33:49.48]I'm gonna get some stuff situated and we can go.
[33:51.14]Get this back over here.
[34:05.02]Yeah, because I'm moving around.
[34:06.90]I'm trying to get situated so I can start this cleaning job.
[34:17.13]Okay, where?
[34:24.36]Good call.
[34:25.48]Nice call.
[34:27.52]Not a bad idea.
[34:28.28]I just ran around.
[34:29.46]I walked around the whole house to get this.
[34:40.40]I'm only going to do two.
[34:41.96]No, I can do three.
[34:46.66]I know I can do three.
[34:48.34]I've done like five before.
[34:51.23]I can't even fit two through the front door.
[34:54.75]Alright, let's go.
[35:09.83]I can't do two.
[35:11.37]No, I can't, apparently.
[35:13.00]Why are you leaving doors closed in this house?
[35:15.74]We're doing a job.
[35:18.08]What?
[35:19.70]Why am I leaving doors closed?
[35:22.28]Before it was open.
[35:23.90]And it was irritating.
[35:28.14]What's going on?
[35:28.60]Am I stuck on something?
[35:31.57]I was just walking on the table?
[35:33.75]That makes no sense.
[35:44.63]Okay, I'm about ready to get going here.
[35:46.17]This is the room right here.
[35:47.33]Oh, I thought we started.
[35:48.67]No, that's fine.
[35:49.09]You can get a head start.
[35:50.31]No, that's fine.
[35:51.41]You're that confident.
[35:52.65]I'm pretty confident.
[35:53.37]I am.
[35:54.01]What the fuck was that?
[35:57.65]I'm confident.
[35:58.17]I am.
[36:02.54]Alright, here we go.
[36:19.00]Why are you doing that?
[36:22.04]I don't know.
[36:24.93]Did you almost get crushed?
[36:25.83]I don't know.
[36:27.43]I was just thinking about dribble sandwiches.
[36:28.93]We're kind of in a house of horrors.
[36:35.89]Why am I even doing this?
[36:36.63]This can just stay in here.
[36:48.50]remember no trace of any liquid everything has to be perfect not even water I mean no no no no water it has to be the room has to be done okay the uh is something of uh an expert how many rooms have you cleaned let's get that straight ever
[37:17.77]Yeah, because you're about to be beat by, like, a one-time room cleaner.
[37:20.89]I mean, I've cleaned a lot of rooms before.
[37:28.14]It depends.
[37:28.66]How many... I mean, we all know you haven't picked up a mop in, like, four years or so you said?
[37:32.70]Five years?
[37:33.12]Something like that?
[37:34.26]Very respectful.
[37:36.88]That's not a bad number.
[37:37.58]Alright, I'm getting... I'm doing pretty well.
[37:49.41]How are you doing over there?
[37:50.49]Things looking good?
[37:51.05]Very good.
[37:51.95]Very good.
[37:52.71]Good, good, good, good.
[37:53.55]I like to hear that.
[37:54.33]I like to hear the competition is, you know, not just a one-sided thing, right?
[38:00.96]Yeah.
[38:04.90]It's nice to see that the server is, like, stable now.
[38:08.50]Yeah.
[38:10.10]I wonder why it was having problems before.
[38:11.98]I don't know.
[38:16.74]I'm just gonna make my own internet.
[38:19.10]Yeah, maybe, I was saying before, maybe you should, like, move to, like, Vegas to fix your internet.
[38:26.00]Every, everything sucks, don't you know?
[38:30.61]Everything sucks.
[38:38.99]Oh, we're getting the actor, uh, we're getting the oversaturated actors thing again.
[38:46.12]Who's an actor?
[38:46.82]I don't know what that means.
[38:48.06]Fuck.
[38:55.65]Oh, nice spill.
[38:57.29]Did you hear it?
[38:58.45]I heard you say fuck and I heard a bucket.
[39:02.37]I haven't spilled once yet.
[39:03.75]This game's easy.
[39:13.49]I need another bucket up here.
[39:22.23]Give me that bucket.
[39:39.80]You need any help?
[39:41.44]No.
[39:41.66]What?
[39:41.92]Why?
[39:42.18]I'm just trying to move some stuff in that house.
[39:47.32]Well, it sounds like you're having trouble.
[39:48.55]I could bring you a bucket.
[39:52.42]Nah, that's good.
[39:54.38]Do you need bucket?
[39:55.02]I could bring you something if you need.
[39:56.82]Nah, I'm good.
[39:58.18]Alright, good.
[39:58.62]Just trying to help each other out here.
[40:02.17]Nice friendly competition.
[40:03.21]That's what we do.
[40:03.97]We just help each other out.
[40:05.87]You know, do you need something?
[40:06.89]I don't need anything.
[40:07.79]I'm good.
[40:08.47]Aw, damn it.
[40:12.38]Okay, let me get out here.
[40:14.24]I just need to dispose of these buckets that I have in my hand.
[40:18.72]And then go this way.
[40:21.68]Cool.
[40:22.00]I need, like, two more buckets, I think, maybe.
[40:34.55]Why do I always go this wrong way?
[40:41.07]Two buckets will do it, and then I've got a little bit more time.
[40:43.61]Alright.
[40:49.55]Come on!
[40:50.09]Do two!
[40:51.24]He's getting ahead of me.
[40:52.34]Come on.
[40:52.74]Hurry up.
[40:56.90]You know the speedrun strat so you can like be half and everything?
[41:00.51]I have my own strategy.
[41:01.73]You do yours.
[41:02.33]Are you trying to knock those out?
[41:07.21]Illegal move.
[41:08.29]Illegal move.
[41:08.99]Illegal move.
[41:10.17]How is this illegal?
[41:10.87]You didn't set any rules.
[41:11.87]Illegal.
[41:12.23]Are you still behind me?
[41:25.95]I needed that bucket, too.
[41:27.09]That's an illegal move.
[41:29.13]If you win, you're disqualified.
[41:32.27]I don't see any rules written anywhere.
[41:34.76]There was a verbal agreement that you were going to be nice today.
[41:41.18]Jeremiah, I'll be nice today.
[41:55.03]How you coming?
[41:56.99]Almost done.
[41:59.18]Really?
[41:59.42]Yeah, this actually isn't that bad.
[42:10.44]Fucking illegal move.
[42:12.14]It was bullshit.
[42:12.79]It really was.
[42:15.59]Oh, if I lose, it was because of that one bucket.
[42:18.71]Yeah, because I needed that.
[42:19.97]I would be almost done by now.
[42:22.89]Uh, can we get a ref?
[42:26.10]Anyone?
[42:26.66]Anyone want to be the ref here?
[42:27.70]Anyone see that?
[42:30.42]I'm just like rubber banded.
[42:40.78]Oh, lag.
[42:41.86]Lag.
[42:42.70]I was gonna win, but I lagged.
[42:45.88]That was an actual illegal move, yeah.
[42:50.41]You don't need me to... I don't need to tell you that.
[43:02.17]Oh my god.
[43:02.85]Okay.
[43:11.80]Watch that.
[43:12.42]Watch it.
[43:12.98]Okay.
[43:34.67]Give yourself a percentage.
[43:36.09]What percentage do you think you are?
[43:38.99]Uh... Like, 80?
[43:41.23]80.
[43:41.35]Yeah, I'm probably around 70.
[43:44.36]I got a way to go, I think.
[43:52.00]Don't get too confident, though.
[43:55.00]I hear comebacks are very common in the, uh... The high level of competition.
[44:07.48]Yeah, I would say I'm like 65% probably.
[44:13.09]Going backwards?
[44:14.69]I think I may have gone backwards a little.
[44:45.73]Do you know the background for this house?
[44:47.07]Like, is this a... It's like a Freddy and Jason or something.
[44:54.37]Something like that.
[44:55.95]The classic Indian burial ground.
[44:57.51]There's some empty graves down here.
[45:03.06]Cool.
[45:04.04]I like graves or something.
[45:08.02]Oh, really?
[45:08.68]Sorry.
[45:12.04]I don't know.
[45:12.54]I'm focusing.
[45:13.68]I'm focusing.
[45:14.56]I'm focusing.
[45:17.07]I'm way behind you, so I need to focus.
[45:47.49]Alright, I'm probably at like... I'm getting there.
[46:11.36]Fuck, I'm so... I'm done.
[46:13.62]Done.
[46:14.88]I said it first.
[46:17.55]I said it first.
[46:18.49]I definitely said it first.
[46:19.97]I said it first.
[46:20.85]I said... I was, like, gonna say it, but then I'm nice to you.
[46:22.99]No, you didn't.
[46:23.79]We were finally gonna say something.
[46:24.75]No, you didn't.
[46:25.19]You didn't say it.
[46:27.31]You did not say shit.
[46:28.89]I said done, and then you said done.
[46:31.74]How about... We base it on whose room is cleaner.
[46:36.10]I bet you have a spot somewhere, like you left something.
[46:38.32]No, no, no.
[46:39.40]Fine, I'll let it slide.
[46:44.17]Okay, let me come see your room.
[46:45.33]Alright, don't track shit up here.
[46:49.04]uh true okay hold on let me walk outside and clean my boots hold on I'm getting clean I think I'm clean
[47:30.73]Okay.
[47:31.55]Inspection.
[47:32.96]Oh, what's that chair?
[47:34.94]I see a knocked over chair behind you.
[47:36.94]I just bumped into it because I was scared that you came in here.
[47:39.50]It was like this.
[47:40.94]Chat took a screenshot.
[47:43.08]Chat took a screenshot.
[47:44.42]No, you startled me.
[47:45.78]It's not right.
[47:46.50]No, I'm sorry.
[47:47.64]If an inspector walks in a room and goes, the person's going to go, what the fuck, and turn.
[47:52.32]That's what you did.
[47:53.78]Okay.
[47:54.30]I'll let it pass.
[47:54.86]It's just... Okay.
[47:58.90]That's good.
[47:59.50]Everything's fine.
[48:01.30]Uh, I am gonna, I have to deduct a point for the chairs.
[48:04.46]What is this chair?
[48:05.64]Where is it facing?
[48:06.87]It's not like a desk, it's just in the middle of the room, a chair.
[48:09.63]That's for- Middle of the room, a chair.
[48:11.65]What's wrong with that?
[48:14.03]Do you guys just leave chairs around your room?
[48:17.04]Um, yeah.
[48:18.88]Is everyone okay with there just being random chairs?
[48:21.92]Where would you put this chair?
[48:23.04]There's no one to sit.
[48:24.56]There's no place for that chair to be.
[48:26.70]It shouldn't be in here.
[48:27.60]But what if I want somebody to come in and help me?
[48:30.32]Maybe if you turned them and you at least pretended that this was a desk.
[48:34.51]Automatically assuming that there's no small baby in this house.
[48:37.79]That the mother would have to sit here and nurse before.
[48:40.91]What are you talking about?
[48:42.97]And you need the chair for that.
[48:45.22]Yeah, you need to sit in a chair for that.
[48:47.94]I don't know.
[48:48.66]I wouldn't put a baby on a chair like that.
[48:50.80]You need a rocking chair.
[48:53.90]The mother sits in the chair with the baby in her arms.
[48:56.96]What are you talking about?
[49:02.27]I don't know.
[49:03.09]Fine.
[49:03.41]Deduct a point.
[49:04.05]I'll take that.
[49:04.53]I'm at 99.
[49:04.75]Still looking.
[49:05.23]You can't, like, open these?
[49:13.18]No, you can't open those.
[49:15.06]What the fuck was that noise?
[49:16.54]That was scary.
[49:24.99]I got spooked.
[49:26.65]Nothing.
[49:27.69]It's nice and clean.
[49:28.49]Alright.
[49:30.25]You get a 99.
[49:30.59]Nice.
[49:30.69]Thank you.
[49:31.01]Okay.
[49:31.23]99.
[49:31.33]One point off.
[49:32.23]That's cool.
[49:42.63]goes above your... Wait.
[49:45.45]Wait.
[49:46.21]What?
[49:46.61]I just got a tip.
[49:47.29]What do you mean a tip?
[49:51.55]Okay.
[49:53.29]If you're the inspector... Okay, that's good.
[49:54.83]Wait, wait, wait.
[49:55.35]Hold on a minute here.
[49:56.07]If you're the inspector, do you have to call other inspectors to do your job for you?
[49:59.55]That was you just did... You just inspected.
[50:01.45]You take photographs and then you get the final reviews from chat, we said.
[50:06.03]So I'm taking their input.
[50:07.63]I know you don't read yours.
[50:09.03]I read mine a lot.
[50:10.84]And I take their input all the time.
[50:13.34]And I'm very nice to them, consistently.
[50:16.72]I would love it if, uh, from yesterday's stream, if anybody could pull up some data on how many times my eyes looked over at the left monitor.
[50:23.08]Uh, that's chat, and it was probably four or five hundred times.
[50:25.60]His chat's on the right.
[50:27.52]Chat is on the left, actually.
[50:29.06]Nope.
[50:29.38]Excuse me.
[50:29.91]I've seen it.
[50:30.67]Okay.
[50:31.17]How would I pick out, how would I pick out the one guy?
[50:32.75]That person's coming to get you.
[50:34.73]That was weird.
[50:35.87]That freaked me out.
[50:36.63]Never mind.
[50:38.32]Bring me an axe.
[50:39.26]Yeah, because the person who has the least score has to get their head chopped.
[50:45.57]This is a horror game.
[50:46.29]Inspectors first.
[50:47.89]Okay.
[50:48.11]Let me clean my feet.
[50:48.97]Let me rub my feet.
[50:51.89]Wow, entryway is a little bit of a... Nope.
[50:56.13]Not judging based on the entry.
[50:59.27]Wow.
[51:00.49]Well, first of all, um... This is not the basement, this is the upper floor.
[51:05.17]Okay, whoa.
[51:07.17]Whoa, I don't know about this.
[51:09.25]You fucking idiot.
[51:27.69]Well, thanks for concentrating.
[51:31.28]You're next, but it's a joke, so you're one of them now.
[51:34.78]I win.
[51:36.38]Oh, oh.
[51:39.06]Oh, I got me.
[51:43.24]Well, here's the funny thing.
[51:44.65]I have a confession to make.
[51:46.37]Yeah.
[51:47.39]I won.
[51:49.33]That's a confession.
[51:49.83]How is that the funny thing?
[51:51.93]Confession, I won.
[51:53.79]Alright, I threw everything out the window.
[52:00.44]So you cheated.
[52:02.08]So did you.
[52:03.60]So you're disqualified and I win.
[52:05.58]No, you cheated too.
[52:07.46]How did I cheat?
[52:08.28]Look, come over here.
[52:11.00]Wait, did I cheat though?
[52:12.04]Or did I just move?
[52:17.99]Wait, did that?
[52:18.61]No, that didn't come out of here.
[52:22.67]We both cheated.
[52:23.45]We both were wrong.
[52:24.63]I didn't cheat.
[52:26.06]I was very deliberate.
[52:27.72]But your room is not clean.
[52:28.88]Whose room is cleaner?
[52:30.70]I think the precedent first is who cheated like if you're caught using you know what what were they using the the cork bats or you know way back in the day when you're hitting slammers you're old enough you remember right hold on so I threw stuff out my window but cleaned the room you made the room way worse whose room is cleaner you deflated the football you lose uh what about what about the illegal move where you knock the shit out of my hands
[53:00.44]That wasn't illegal.
[53:01.98]That's fair game.
[53:03.62]No, my room was cleaner.
[53:05.26]And I could have just, like, kept that lie up, and you would have just been so disappointed.
[53:09.52]I can't believe you did this, though, but thanks for putting everything in the right spot for us to clean.
[53:17.55]Alright, we're gonna work together.
[53:18.47]We're still doing this.
[53:20.47]What do you mean we're still doing this?
[53:23.01]I would love to see you actually clean the basement disaster zone now.
[53:27.63]You're just gonna watch.
[53:29.59]Show me how it's done.
[53:33.87]You're just going to watch me do this.
[53:35.95]Okay, let's do it together.
[53:37.61]Nice catch.
[53:41.41]Alright, so, that's not the basement.

[56:10.52]Yeah, nice clean room you had there.
[56:13.22]Alright, this is not doing so well.
[56:15.30]I think they're still alive.
[56:19.66]Are you sure you killed them?
[56:21.47]Are you sure you killed these people?
[56:23.23]I am sure they're dead.
[56:26.13]We're missing somebody.
[56:35.17]That person's gone.
[56:40.98]Wait, there's more down here.

[57:16.16]I guess there's no back door, but why... I found the one true ring.
[57:20.81]The one true ring.
[57:23.47]Let's rule them all.
[57:25.78]Lord of the Rings.
[57:26.44]Okay.

[60:47.05]How about not farthest, but the stairs are the limit.
[60:50.09]You can't walk in front of the stairs.
[60:51.66]Alright, stairs are the limit.
[60:52.58]That sounds good.
[60:53.26]Is it?
[60:54.94]Is there a way to put momentum behind it?
[60:57.44]I don't know.
[61:04.28]No, I can't like golf him in there.
[61:07.26]Alright, I'm gonna try.
[61:08.26]Here we go.
[61:12.68]It looks so silly trying to get like full momentum.
[61:15.30]Okay, move, move, move.
[61:15.90]Let me show you how it's done.
[61:19.97]Holy shit, that was close.
[61:21.21]That was pretty good.
[61:28.89]Wait, wait.
[61:29.39]Somebody says you can hold left-click.
[61:35.32]Hold left-click and shake the mouse?
[61:42.20]Oh, that's... Oh, it's just to rotate him.
[61:46.83]Uh... I lost mine.
[61:52.77]What?
[61:53.49]How did he go backwards?
[61:54.13]I lost mine.
[62:00.57]You didn't even dunk it.
[62:02.31]Oh, you don't think I can dunk it?
[62:06.32]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[62:14.14]I'm just gonna place him in.
[62:17.12]I lost him.
[62:21.07]Did you just die?
[62:21.91]Oh shit.
[62:29.84]I guess I win!
[62:32.00]I'm back!
[62:32.58]I respawned!
[62:36.60]Yes, you can die in Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[62:38.76]Alright, you dunk.
[62:47.64]How are you doing that?
[62:50.92]I'm gonna get it.
[62:51.52]Oh, come on.
[63:00.90]Somewhere in the future, someone's gonna pull up this video, and they're gonna be like, what the fuck was wrong with people?
[63:09.33]Why are they simulating, like, throwing each other, like, dead bodies into a grinder?
[63:15.01]What were they doing this for?
[63:16.85]Come on!
[63:27.17]It looks like you're doing like a magical spell.
[63:47.92]Thank you for just standing by and watching too because like you could stop this.
[63:51.78]I could but will I?
[63:53.14]No.
[63:57.01]Come on.
[63:57.27]If I could stand a little closer.
[63:59.33]No.
[64:00.47]You have to get it from here.
[64:07.20]Whoa.
[64:08.32]It's hard to see where I'm throwing because I'm not looking where I'm throwing.
[64:12.22]Oh, dunk.
[64:13.80]Oh, you dunked him.
[64:20.75]He's standing closer.
[64:29.10]Never mind.
[64:30.66]How are you doing that?
[64:31.28]You're going like, you're doing like swing up, down, up, down.
[64:35.08]Yeah.
[64:36.70]Look up?
[64:37.82]Yeah, look up because you need to get some height on it.
[64:44.19]And at the end, when you pull it forward, you got to right click them.
[64:51.07]It's really hard to get height.
[64:53.28]It is really hard to get the height on it.
[64:59.18]Please hurry up and do this so my fucking great-grandkids don't... Oh, good, you got it.
[65:02.78]You got it.
[65:04.46]You did it.
[65:05.40]You actually did it.
[65:06.44]I was gonna say, because my great-grandkids don't think I'm, like, a fucking psycho.
[65:11.32]Did you see me?
[65:11.98]Did you watch me?
[65:12.90]Or were you, like, looking at the stars?
[65:14.28]No, I saw it.
[65:15.10]It was great.
[65:15.82]I just spun my mouse around in circles and, like, I totally gave up.
[65:22.48]Alright, let's do an alley-oop.
[65:23.40]Alright.
[65:28.29]Ready?
[65:29.35]Yeah.
[65:29.51]Alright, let's go back to the basement.
[65:37.72]Four hours, by the way.
[65:47.94]Go.
[65:48.40]One at a time.
[66:04.35]You're still doing, like, the magician trick.
[66:07.47]I gotta, like, try.
[66:08.89]I gotta make the job fun somehow.
[66:12.00]Whoa.
[66:12.72]That was weird.
[66:16.34]Oh, yeah.
[66:16.78]If you do it too fast, you just drop them.
[66:18.86]Alright.
[66:19.44]Wait.
[66:19.66]Is that all the bodies?
[66:20.52]Woo!
[66:22.72]What happened?
[66:25.30]God damn it.
[66:25.76]Why did you do this?
[66:26.54]Oh, why?
[66:28.50]That was a clean throw.

[67:56.59]There's a skeleton in here.
[68:04.17]You really did.
[68:05.27]It's like too much stuff.
[68:09.43]Hey, hey, hey.
[68:10.21]Do we get rid of the boxes or we just reshelf?
[68:13.49]No, we gotta get... No, that's not the strategy.
[68:17.27]What?
[68:17.43]This is where they were.
[68:22.36]I'm going to get two more buckets.
[68:24.34]And I'm gonna go get... There's one already here.
[68:26.64]Nice.
[68:27.40]But this one's dirty, so get rid of it.
[68:35.26]Whether you like it or not, as long as my internet stays on... Oh, I know what it is.
[68:38.84]I know what it is.
[68:39.20]You are stuck here.
[68:41.10]You can't reach the top shelf.
[68:42.34]Is that some kind of joke?
[68:45.49]Is that... Is that... I don't understand.
[68:47.79]Is that like a... Like, what do you mean?
[68:52.19]What do you mean?
[68:54.67]I mean, like, I... You would rather take the boxes out of here, like, all the way up the stairs for each individual box, than admit that you can't reach the top shelf.
[69:04.35]But you can't reach the top shelf.
[69:07.13]No, I... What?
[69:08.67]Like, you can't reach the top shelf, right?
[69:11.09]That's what you're saying.
[69:12.55]No, I'm saying you can't.
[69:13.67]Like, I can't, but you can't either.
[69:15.81]I totally can.
[69:18.76]So if I came over there right now, and we both tried to grab the top shelf, you... No, to put a box up on the top shelf.
[69:31.25]I don't think you're putting down what I'm picking up here.
[69:34.83]I don't... But I'm very... I'm a huge... They actually call me Massive Man now.
[69:42.14]Massive Man?
[69:43.66]Yeah, MM for short.
[69:44.88]That's my new thing.
[69:45.90]Why are you Massive Man?

[69:59.90]Well, the outside's going pretty well because I'm doing some work.
[70:02.76]I'm working on it.
[70:05.51]Remember where we're going to put the collective... Why is there only one?
[70:08.37]Oh, yeah, because my internet turned off.
[70:17.64]Remember what?
[70:18.88]Remember to put the USBs outside the door, the front door to the right.
[70:24.60]That way we get our bonus.

[72:02.12]At this here when we're at the cleaning job?
[72:04.66]No.
[72:05.34]You said you would help.
[72:07.49]We were both going to do the basement and we were going to help each other.
[72:09.93]I did say that, but I'm still going to do that.
[72:11.83]I am going to rub a corpse all along the roof if you don't get down here.

[72:55.96]What did you do?
[72:56.92]Why did you do that?
[72:58.24]Why did you do that?
[72:58.84]How can you possibly say that's my fault?
[73:00.86]You took it out.
[73:02.59]You took it out.
[73:05.83]You must have done something.
[73:06.93]You had to have done something.

[73:21.97]These are ring wraiths.
[73:24.33]I don't know what you're talking about.
[73:26.49]You don't even know anything.
[73:28.73]Just grab a bucket and meet me downstairs.
[73:31.26]You know nothing.
[73:39.80]You fucked this up so bad down here.
[73:42.19]I don't think it's even possible to do this.
[73:45.42]How is it not possible?
[73:46.59]Okay, here's your job.
[73:48.33]You want to send, like, a message to HR?
[73:50.59]Fine.
[73:51.85]Go just bring buckets down here.
[73:54.55]And... Go get, like, just keep bringing them down.
[73:58.32]Okay, I'll bring one down, take something out.
[74:02.10]Talk about cans of peas, all the random vegetables, get them into the trash can, and then we'll incinerate them.
[74:11.03]Yeah.
[74:13.89]You, uh...
[74:16.52]You can reach the top shelf down there.
[74:18.00]Hold on.
[74:24.03]Okay, he's in.
[74:29.99]Didn't put water in this one?
[74:32.53]There were a couple that I brought down from before.
[74:34.44]Oh.
[74:43.32]Dude, fuck this bucket stacking.
[74:46.26]It's a waste of everyone's time.
[74:47.56]This is dirty water.
[74:48.42]Okay, put those... Alright.
[75:01.27]We're gonna have to take the boxes up like one by one, I think.
[75:04.65]I'm shelving them.
[75:05.95]You're putting these on the shelves?
[75:09.05]Yeah.
[75:12.94]Oh, you're standing on a bucket to do it.
[75:14.58]Cute.
[75:25.20]You didn't even clean up here.
[75:27.78]You didn't even clean up here, though, dude.
[75:29.32]Like, come on.
[75:30.98]We can clean after you put the boxes there.
[75:32.96]You can't.
[75:33.42]You're going to knock the boxes off.
[75:36.47]What do you mean?
[75:37.93]You're going to clean under the boxes?
[75:40.31]You're going to clean under the boxes after the boxes are up there?
[75:45.47]I'm sure you can.
[75:46.43]Oh, man.
[75:49.18]I don't think I can work like this.
[75:50.70]I don't think I can.
[75:52.62]Holy fuck, I just jumped over everything.
[75:53.94]I'm good.
[75:54.52]That would have been very bad.
[75:55.70]Alright, can we at least take care of the entryway?
[76:00.80]Can you bring a candle down here, too?
[76:12.93]Are you... I just heard a spill.
[76:14.95]That wasn't me.
[76:27.84]What?
[76:29.36]You spilled the bucket and I wasn't me, so it's funny to me.
[76:32.70]What bucket?
[76:34.95]I heard like a... Up here.
[76:37.39]That was me throwing out old buckets.
[76:49.80]Get back in the fucking basement.
[77:02.66]Okay, you made... Where'd it go?
[77:10.05]I heard it.
[77:11.87]You've made permanent marks on the wall.
[77:14.55]Permanent.
[77:15.31]Yeah, these are permanent marks.
[77:17.11]Oh.
[77:18.53]Oh, maybe not.
[77:21.07]Just clean around.
[77:25.91]Slow.
[77:29.79]Easy.
[77:35.32]Bring a candle down here.
[77:38.86]I know you can.
[77:40.02]They're right next to you.
[77:41.04]Okay, I'll do it.
[77:43.28]Thank you.
[77:44.48]It's atmosphere.
[77:46.08]We're doing the Halloween map.
[77:47.45]You don't want to have atmosphere here.
[77:50.63]There's a little, there's a little cabin.
[77:52.79]Okay, I got it.
[77:53.43]I got it.
[77:53.65]What was that?
[78:01.63]What was that?
[78:02.07]Focus on, focus on what's in front of you.
[78:03.75]What do you mean what's in front of me?
[78:05.07]Like, do your task.
[78:07.54]What's that noise?
[78:08.14]Worrying about everyone else is doing.
[78:09.34]I'm getting you the candle.
[78:10.46]Alright, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[78:11.28]Take this.
[78:11.66]You're like, what's that?
[78:12.96]There was a chainsaw sound.
[78:14.18]I thought you brought a chainsaw down.
[78:15.18]Take this.
[78:15.52]No, that was the creating a candle.
[78:18.56]Oh.
[78:19.86]That, right?
[78:20.38]Like, put it on the... Yeah, no, no, no.
[78:21.57]I have to clean there.
[78:23.49]Take this up with you when you're out.
[78:26.11]Here, you put it where you want it.
[78:27.51]Yeah, I will.
[78:28.05]And then just take this... This one's dirty.
[78:29.39]Let's get rid of that one.
[78:30.29]Throw it in the incinerator.
[78:32.89]There we go.
[78:34.52]Thank you.
[78:35.16]That's so much better.
[78:47.73]Alright.
[78:49.43]Why are you up here?
[78:51.17]I just wanted to check.
[78:53.61]Check what?
[78:54.43]I just had to check on something.
[78:58.15]Not a big deal.
[79:03.12]I'm going to have something else for you to take.
[79:07.88]Why would we grind these up?
[79:09.24]These are perfectly good beans.
[79:13.74]Alright, this is starting to do the thing where there's too many physics objects in the thing at the same time.
[79:17.82]So you have to take this and get out of here with this.
[79:20.67]Let me shake it up a little.
[79:21.63]Okay.
[79:21.75]Okay.
[79:22.05]Drop it.
[79:22.47]Drop it.
[79:22.97]Drop it.
[79:23.89]Hold on.
[79:24.23]Drop it.
[79:27.15]Yep.
[79:27.91]Easy.
[79:29.95]Careful.
[79:30.35]It's gonna do the physics thing.
[79:33.54]I'm... I'm well aware of the physics thing.
[79:40.16]See?
[79:40.38]Don't you think this is a cool game?
[79:46.84]Hello?
[79:47.94]It's great.
[79:48.58]It's great.
[79:50.85]It's great.
[79:53.07]Don't be sarcastic about it.
[79:54.35]It's fun.
[79:55.63]It's great.
[79:56.67]Just wait till we do another one after this.
[80:05.69]Which one's next?
[80:06.29]I'm already looking forward to it.
[80:08.39]Well, we better hurry up.
[80:10.57]We got work to do here.
[80:21.91]Oh, nice job.
[80:22.23]Putting the boxes back on the shelf.
[80:24.97]Nice job, like, hiding the beans for yourself.
[80:27.69]What do you mean, hiding the what?
[80:30.17]Put the box in front of the beans so no one knows there's beans back there.
[80:33.47]There's a broken plate over here.
[80:37.22]Do you want another box?
[80:38.08]Is that what you're saying?
[80:38.80]Stand over here for a second.
[80:39.78]Just stand over here.
[80:42.54]Get, like, in the light right there.
[80:45.32]Right there.
[80:47.02]Oops.
[80:47.68]Sorry, I dropped it.
[80:52.78]Don't do it.
[80:59.60]Why did you... What?
[81:00.73]How did I end up with this in my hand?
[81:04.53]What?
[81:05.11]Just... Okay.
[81:13.98]Okay.
[81:15.18]I didn't do that.
[81:16.94]That was mean.
[81:17.58]That was a mean thing that he did.
[81:19.18]Are you bringing new... You're not bringing new buckets down.
[81:23.33]These are still clean.
[81:26.07]The one you just dumped on me was full of blood.
[81:28.13]And now I have to take out this box.
[81:30.11]There's two clean buckets right here.
[81:31.93]And now I gotta take this box out.
[81:33.33]Look what you've done over here.
[81:35.93]And you're tracking mud all over the place.
[81:37.64]Thank god that candle's down here.
[81:48.22]Did I just break the grinder?
[81:50.80]What?
[81:51.32]We need that.
[81:51.70]I heard like a... But it's fine.
[81:53.14]It's fine.
[81:53.66]Don't worry about it.
[81:54.44]USB right here.
[81:58.69]Alright.
[81:59.11]Look.
[81:59.33]Come on.
[81:59.79]It's looking pretty good.
[82:02.19]It's not looking bad.
[82:02.91]Yep.
[82:05.49]This is almost one room done.
[82:08.09]Well, this room was like 10 rooms because you made it that way.
[82:17.26]Anything in this?
[82:17.76]No.
[82:22.42]The only reason why this room is taking so long is because you put all the trash from all the other rooms into one room.
[82:29.36]All those boxes were in that room already.
[82:32.06]What about the ten bodies?
[82:33.16]Where did you get those?
[82:34.55]I got the bodies from a lot of places.
[82:36.47]Are you calling those bodies trash?
[82:41.03]Respect the bodies.
[82:47.96]Thank you for the new water.
[82:53.78]No, come here.
[82:54.26]Give me this candle.
[82:56.30]There we go.
[82:56.92]Now I can see better.
[82:57.78]Now here we go.
[82:58.72]Okay.

[83:06.21]Consolidated.
[83:07.33]Yeah, I could... What is this?
[83:09.47]Like a credit card payment?
[83:12.19]No, this is like a... Alright.
[83:19.66]Almost cleaned up your whole mess.
[83:31.36]That was a Jerry Seinfeld level joke.
[83:38.23]Seinfeld is a hilarious show.
[83:42.67]That's a very funny show.
[83:44.20]So that's okay.
[83:45.48]That's like a 9 out of 9.8 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes.
[83:51.22]Why would I be mad about that?
[83:54.56]yeah it's like one of the best shows of all time I mean that's like saying like oh man wow what you just did right there oh that was like that was like something god would do very comparable like oh well yeah I get okay isn't streaming much better with an audience

[84:21.23]Oh, like when you hear Ashley laugh.
[84:23.84]It's like you can imagine you're streaming in front of an auditorium.
[84:26.50]Well, there's like one person in the stands.
[84:30.24]There's one person in the stands.
[84:32.27]But at least they showed up.
[84:36.13]I don't hear any laughs from your side.
[84:42.87]No, no, that person's not here in the auditorium.
[84:46.55]You brought a cell phone and put it on speakerphone and put it in the chair.
[84:54.04]And they're watching the live video of my, like, stand-up routine.
[85:00.00]Yeah.
[85:01.38]Critics are saying it's as good as Seinfeld.

[86:09.75]You weren't live when I turned it on.
[86:13.65]That never happened.
[86:14.65]I checked your stream.
[86:17.61]We both started at the same time.
[86:20.21]Yeah, but did you turn your stream off after you played Overwatch?
[86:23.92]Yeah.
[86:24.70]That's what I'm saying.
[86:25.36]Alright, you ready?
[86:33.64]I've got most of the trash.
[86:34.46]We did a good job.
[86:35.48]We did.
[86:37.12]How satisfied do you feel?
[86:38.70]I'm not that satisfied yet, because there's still things that need to be done.
[86:43.15]Can't you just take a moment and, like, be happy?
[86:45.91]We can after we get it all done.
[86:48.02]I've actually never seen you smile.
[86:52.10]Uh, you look at the ceiling.
[86:52.88]We're not done.
[86:53.28]Need another bucket?
[86:59.46]Uh, I don't think I need another bucket.
[87:01.25]Thank you for the, uh, the considerate one.
[87:08.47]Alright.
[87:11.89]How long's it been?
[87:12.46]Four hours?
[87:14.09]I think we're at like seven.
[87:22.32]Okay.
[87:23.44]It's a... The basement is pretty much done.
[87:26.20]There's a little bit left on the floor, on the wall a little bit.
[87:31.12]Oops.
[87:31.54]It's alright.

[87:48.97]Oh, I don't know.
[87:51.03]I'll figure what that does.
[87:51.69]Alright, I'm going to use the candle.
[87:52.77]We're going to check.
[87:53.27]Alright, everything looks okay.
[87:57.54]Except for that.
[87:59.18]That's why I need the light down here.
[88:02.36]Well, don't you have like the speedometer to check where the blood is?
[88:05.28]Yeah, but I mean, it's easier to just see it.
[88:13.77]Why don't you have a speedometer?
[88:18.38]Saved.
[88:19.82]Yeah, that was just a little boop.
[88:22.42]We're fine.
[88:24.26]I don't mind the little boops.
[88:26.20]It's the, your internet turns off to zero.

[88:47.33]Oh god, what did you do in here?
[88:48.51]Uh, it was like that when I found it.
[88:51.21]It's actually not hard to clean, but unfortunately, I'm sorry to say, uh, we need another bucket down here.
[88:57.58]I'm sure you do.
[89:01.71]I'm gonna bring one up.
[89:03.33]I'll go get it.
[89:03.77]You just keep doing your thing.
[89:05.15]I'm bringing the bucket.

[89:08.37]Well, okay, I'm gonna stay in the basement, but just don't... There's a lot of blood to track, so don't track it up here.
[89:13.27]I have two buckets that are full of gross stuff that I need you to take.
[89:22.56]Clean your feet.
[89:23.22]Clean your feet.
[89:23.60]Clean your feet.

[89:52.25]Oh, fuck.
[89:55.61]God damn it.
[90:10.38]Do you still have the one of me complaining?
[90:12.96]I don't.
[90:13.42]People ask for it all day, and I forgot.
[90:16.20]You're going to have to give me a new one, and I'll have to remember.
[90:18.78]Hey, hold on.
[90:20.29]I'll just bring it.

[90:28.51]I'm not moving.
[90:30.73]You're tracking stuff everywhere.
[90:31.86]I don't want to read that.
[90:39.39]Alright, give me one.
[90:42.14]Give you what?
[90:43.82]You were going to give me a line.
[90:45.34]When did I say I was going to give you a line?
[90:46.78]I thought you just said... Okay, never mind.
[90:48.64]I'm crazy.
[90:49.32]Never mind.
[90:49.74]I said, what happened to the one you recorded?
[90:53.06]Yeah, I said I didn't save it by accident.
[90:55.50]And then you said, hold on, I'll give you one.
[90:56.98]And then... Did I do that?
[90:59.26]Yeah, then... I don't think I did that.
[91:09.01]Did I say that?
[91:09.69]Alright, well, turn it on.
[91:13.41]Okay.
[91:15.53]No, I was talking about the... Yeah, I was talking about the ear.
[91:17.71]Yeah, I wasn't... I didn't say that.
[91:19.21]Alright.
[91:20.23]You ready?
[91:22.31]Yeah.
[91:29.72]Hold on.
[91:30.30]Oh, yeah, I was complaining about DPS, right.
[91:32.34]Okay.

[92:09.15]It's not funny!
[92:10.41]I'm upset!
[92:12.13]Hello?
[92:17.27]What the fuck?

[92:53.98]So everything's still clean.
[92:55.42]Yeah.
[92:56.06]Oh, it is.
[92:57.34]Holy shit.
[92:57.88]Okay, cool.
[92:59.21]I'm coming in.
[93:00.75]How did you... You didn't get that?
[93:03.59]I thought that we... Like, I thought everything got disconnected.
[93:06.43]No, I'm fine.
[93:07.21]Because I'm hosting this one.
[93:12.85]Oh, cool.
[93:13.82]Hello?
[93:14.00]Hello?
[93:18.46]I'm so fucking sad right now.

[93:39.90]Uh, we were cleaning the basement.
[93:41.86]Okay, we were cleaning the basement.
[93:42.88]Cool.
[93:42.98]Alright, so where were we?
[93:44.62]Hello?
[93:47.48]Leave me alone.
[93:48.82]Leave me alone.
[93:50.38]I can't.
[93:51.74]I have too many emotions right now.
[93:53.48]I'm being stretched.
[93:55.24]I'm being stretched in two different directions.
[93:57.97]We're almost done with the basement.
[93:59.83]You're gonna pull me in half.
[94:02.07]I have like anger and upset and fucking rage.
[94:04.97]And then you're making me laugh.
[94:05.87]I have anger.
[94:10.15]Hello?
[94:14.71]Are you in?
[94:15.41]I'm in.
[94:15.89]I'm in.
[94:16.27]I'm in.
[94:16.55]I'm here.
[94:17.03]I'm here.
[94:17.43]I'm very angry, but I'm here.
[94:20.52]I'm very angry.
[94:21.00]I forget what door is the basement door.
[94:22.48]That's how fucked up I am.
[94:29.62]Okay, the basement is clean, I think.
[94:35.02]Basement's clean.
[94:37.26]Yeah.
[94:39.66]Did I drop again?
[94:42.08]Uh, no, I... I... No.
[94:45.02]Alright, the bathroom is clean.
[94:46.24]The toilet is clean.
[94:48.34]Oh, I broke the toilet, but it's okay.
[94:50.64]Oh.
[94:51.16]Typical.
[94:53.71]Fucked up I am.
[94:55.67]No, it's fine.
[94:56.59]I can close it.
[94:58.43]Clean.
[94:59.31]Clean, clean, clean.
[95:00.23]Alright, this is clean.
[95:01.03]That's clean.
[95:01.61]This is clean over here.
[95:05.67]Clean this way.
[95:06.95]Oh, don't do it again!
[95:08.71]Don't do it again.
[95:15.45]It's gonna do it again.
[95:16.93]No, it's not.
[95:17.65]You're fine.
[95:18.29]Your stream's up.
[95:18.99]Everyone's loving it.
[95:20.49]Everyone's loving this content that you're providing.
[95:22.29]Thanks, thanks, thanks.
[95:22.87]You really make me feel better.
[95:23.83]Alright, let's go.
[95:25.04]Basement is clean.
[95:28.14]I'm so happy that you brought me along as backup streamer.
[95:37.47]You're like the never turn off the battery thing.
[95:41.99]Yeah.
[95:42.31]Whatever it is.
[95:42.81]The thing you plug in to make sure your power doesn't turn off.
[95:46.34]I'm the backup generator.
[95:47.56]Yes.
[95:49.54]What did I call it?
[95:51.22]I'm the battery thing.
[95:52.52]I think you called it.
[95:53.24]The never turn off, whatever.
[95:54.72]The never turn off battery thing.
[95:59.85]Okay, so I need... What's going on over here?
[96:03.53]Are you throwing more stuff out the window?
[96:07.49]What?
[96:07.71]No, I'm finishing up the basement.
[96:09.22]There's a couple like empty books down here.
[96:11.18]Okay, so this is, what's in here?
[96:13.72]This one can be done quickly.
[96:22.08]Yeah, I remember this was me, yeah.
[96:24.32]I'm gonna clean up over here.
[96:27.64]Hello?
[96:30.01]Hello?
[96:30.55]Just get, like, fucking 10 of them.
[96:31.71]You ready?
[96:33.83]Yeah.
[96:34.65]Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?
[96:49.65]Ashley's ruining him.
[96:50.73]Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello? Hello?
[97:05.21]Uh, that was a Charlie Brown's yell, I know.
[97:10.68]That's a nice car.
[97:12.10]Can you stop goofing around with your soundboard?
[97:19.00]Get this building clean.
[97:21.25]Oh, I'm doing the uh, the garage.
[97:23.45]Hello?
[97:28.88]Hello.
[97:32.32]I feel like it'd be just easier to demolish this building.
[97:35.44]Yeah.
[97:36.52]It would be way easier just to do like a controlled demolition.
[97:54.54]Did you see the car?
[98:03.80]What car?
[98:06.20]There's a really cool car in here.
[98:08.79]Yeah, I saw it.
[98:09.87]I took a body from that room.
[98:13.11]You left a body in that room, too, though.
[98:15.41]Oh.
[98:16.01]Well, see, I was having a hard time running around and grabbing bodies and also making sure you didn't seem to grab all of them.
[98:23.94]But little did I know, you never left the room.
[98:26.91]No.
[98:28.49]I did not walk out of the room once.
[98:29.63]I didn't really hear you walking around.
[98:30.93]I was wondering what was going on.
[98:33.09]I was doing my own little scheme.
[98:37.70]I had a scheme going.
[98:39.54]How fucked up I am.
[98:42.12]That was so angry.
[98:43.36]I am so mad right now.
[98:53.69]Scheme.
[98:59.96]I think we're done.
[99:01.14]We are not done.
[99:01.88]Do you know how much is left in here?
[99:04.76]I think we're done.
[99:09.00]We are not done.
[99:10.16]Pull out your little ecto gun thing and see where it is.
[99:14.10]It says all clear.
[99:16.26]It says all clear on it.
[99:18.27]Hold on.
[99:18.73]I'm getting a phone call.
[99:19.45]Hello?
[99:19.65]Hello?
[99:22.95]They're calling it in.
[99:23.91]We're done.
[99:24.23]What?
[99:26.23]What the hell was that?
[99:29.64]Yeah, all clear here.
[99:31.78]That was my phone.
[99:34.40]Our walkie.
[99:35.68]All janitors have them.
[99:38.72]This is not done, though.
[99:41.28]You got your soundboard.
[99:51.05]Alright, um, don't even show wallpaper in that room.
[99:52.97]Why throw the candle away?
[99:53.85]We could use that somewhere.
[99:55.31]Alright, the car looks pretty good.
[100:00.52]Johnny, we've left money in the pantry for you.
[100:03.06]Remember to call us straight away if Jason or Danielle try to reach us in case something goes wrong at the Crystal Lake summer camp.
[100:10.96]Hello?
[100:12.40]Hello?
[100:14.72]Hello?
[100:15.82]Hello?
[100:17.78]Hello?
[100:17.96]Let's get this trash out of here.
[100:20.54]Hello?
[100:20.94]You can use that.
[100:26.00]You can use that somewhere.
[100:27.24]I think you can use that somewhere.
[100:29.46]Hello?
[100:38.04]Testing my mic.
[100:42.38]Well, don't worry.
[100:42.82]You'll disconnect again and I'll have plenty of use for the hello.
[100:45.86]Yeah, he'll have plenty to use when I disconnect a fourth time today.
[100:55.84]How about you stream when it's working?
[100:58.48]Like, during the day.
[101:00.25]That is the theory.
[101:02.35]It is during the day.
[101:05.01]Oh.
[101:07.27]Hello?
[101:12.11]Garage is almost clean.
[101:16.31]There are a couple of knives.
[101:18.41]I clean the front yard.
[101:19.81]Front yard's clear.
[101:20.57]Front yard good.
[101:23.21]This is not trash.
[101:25.83]They're just knives.
[101:27.39]That's not garbage.
[101:28.07]It's a knife.
[101:31.85]Uh, here's the question.
[101:35.60]If we do such a good job of cleaning, does that mean the parents never know what happened to their kids?
[101:44.70]Um...
[101:47.14]well no because wouldn't they know what what how would well I just read that note that was telling them you know good luck at summer camp and you know blah blah blah um so like if everything is spick and span and perfect when they come back how do they know what happened uh so shouldn't we leave like one blood stain with like a murder weapon
[102:14.82]I mean, that's... They've already been notified.
[102:19.10]Are we the bad guys?
[102:20.72]No.
[102:21.34]We're just the cleaning crew.
[102:24.44]How do you know they've been notified?
[102:25.58]Did Big Boss Man tell you that?
[102:28.46]I don't know.
[102:29.00]I'm just assuming that they've been notified.
[102:31.76]Don't you ever think, like, outside what you're currently doing, like your job, do you ever think, like, you know, what if it's not all true?
[102:44.01]You read too many fucking books.
[102:49.69]You read too many books.
[102:50.63]You should just be drinking tap water and eating fucking Cheerios.
[102:54.15]Like the rest of us.
[102:57.19]Fuck, I broke the glass.
[103:01.91]Hello?
[103:02.29]Oh, there's someone at the front door.
[103:05.19]Hello?
[103:05.67]Hello?
[103:07.29]Hello?
[103:08.90]Let me fight myself.
[103:11.18]Hey, what's up, dude?
[103:12.64]Nothing much.
[103:12.98]Hello?
[103:14.44]How are you?
[103:16.06]Hello?
[103:17.00]Hi.
[103:17.38]That's all I have!
[103:19.45]I don't want to press the wrong button, too.
[103:20.83]I'm forgetting which is which.
[103:21.91]How fucked up I am.
[103:24.39]I was pretty... So, I got some stuff over here if you need it.
[103:28.82]I need a bucket over here.
[103:31.67]Oh, cool.
[103:33.35]No, that was pretty cool.
[103:34.82]But not cool, because the internet sucks.
[103:37.10]So just deal with it.
[103:37.90]Oh, cool.
[103:38.98]I'm not gonna deal with it, because that's fucking bullshit.
[103:40.86]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[103:43.88]Cool.
[103:44.30]Stop, not funny.
[103:50.58]She laughed.
[103:52.12]The measurement of what's funny is if my wife laughs, so I think you're wrong.
[103:57.52]I was trying to have me yell, talk to me.
[104:01.52]Oh, cool.
[104:04.62]You don't even... You don't... What?
[104:05.96]You don't, like, get comedy?
[104:11.71]I've heard people compare this stream to Seinfeld, so... I think I get comedy.
[104:17.59]And he's pretty close to the man upstairs himself, from my hear.
[104:20.54]Yep.
[104:25.19]What do you do with the USBs when you're done?
[104:28.44]You put them in the wrong way first every time.
[104:31.02]You never get it right first try.
[104:32.86]Oh my god.
[104:33.56]Ain't that the truth.
[104:45.09]Oh my god.
[104:45.85]Is this how you get on the roof?
[104:49.27]I tried to use that thing earlier.
[104:53.38]It doesn't go up behind him.
[104:55.60]What's the point?
[105:02.08]Dear Mr. and Mrs. Adams, I'm sorry to report that your son, Jason, has been implicated in another unusual incident.
[105:08.58]This is the third time... Look, see?
[105:11.31]They left a thing.
[105:12.41]Where?
[105:12.99]I want to read it.
[105:13.91]Could you please, next time, respectfully hand it to me?
[105:19.29]This is a game about physics.
[105:20.87]There is no such thing as handing it to you.
[105:23.27]There is.
[105:31.07]No, this is a previous... This has nothing to do with everyone being dead.
[105:34.25]No, is this... You don't write, like, a kindly worded letter because he murdered, like, eight people.
[105:43.92]Look, will you just come back into the room with the big dinner on it?
[105:46.86]Alright, is this done?
[105:51.39]Give it a look.
[105:52.99]This room?
[105:54.03]Yeah.
[105:54.81]There's blood here, chairs on the floor.
[105:56.65]I'm trying to do it.
[106:00.99]You asked.
[106:02.39]Make sure you're not tracking like I am.
[106:04.27]I'm not tracking.
[106:07.51]Glass.
[106:12.42]Respectfully putting the glass here.
[106:13.82]Actually, we need to put the tableware out.
[106:16.36]That needs to be glass.
[106:18.34]Put it all out.
[106:20.39]So I can come home and have a nice dinner with no family remaining?
[106:26.01]I want every goddamn plate.
[106:28.27]Honey, come down to your favorite breakfast.
[106:32.29]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[106:34.67]Oh, please give me them.
[106:45.70]Why are you stacking the chairs like this?
[106:48.00]Well, you just smashed a plate.
[106:50.08]Because I had to be glass breaking.
[106:51.78]What?
[106:51.98]What?
[106:57.25]I'm trying to set the table, and you'll be a dick.
[107:01.71]How am I?
[107:03.03]You're breaking things.
[107:04.74]I'm... Can I ask you how the chair got on the table?
[107:09.54]Can I just ask?
[107:10.12]You smashed it, and I thought we were smashing, so I joined you.
[107:12.58]You thought we were smashing things.
[107:14.08]You made the Pop-Tart reference.
[107:15.46]I thought we were smashing things, so I joined you.
[107:19.66]I'm a follower.
[107:20.90]You know this about me.
[107:24.05]Are you a fucking sub to this channel?
[107:27.42]What?
[107:32.00]Am I?
[107:33.24]Yeah.
[107:36.16]Oh yeah, that's right.
[107:36.68]Somebody gifted you a sub last time.
[107:43.93]The table is clean, so I can do... The table is going to be set.
[107:59.63]I should just move the chairs out of the way.
[108:09.04]This is the... Oh, my God.
[108:10.90]This is the grossest thing I've found the whole time we've been doing this.
[108:14.48]Where are you?
[108:15.34]This is the grossest thing.
[108:16.60]Like an old food container?
[108:21.86]Yeah.
[108:22.44]It's, like, green and red, like... the pigs that we're cleaning up after.
[108:32.29]Okay, table looks like I'm setting it.
[108:35.53]I have to be completely honest.
[108:37.19]Yeah.
[108:38.27]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[108:41.26]Like, why are we still doing this?
[108:44.20]Because this is the game.
[108:47.86]So?
[108:48.66]Alright, I said it's kind of a bad job setting the table.
[108:54.66]Three people eat on plates over here, and then only, people only get to have drinks over this way.
[109:00.58]You gotta put the, push the chairs in.
[109:10.03]I bet you you won't break a plate.
[109:12.96]Oh, and the head of the table.
[109:15.52]The head of the table gets the light in their face.
[109:18.98]That's, no, that's just so they can inspect the food.
[109:21.52]No, that's so, like, you know that they're the one hosting the dinner.
[109:25.66]Like, a look at me.
[109:28.44]Me, me, me.
[109:30.58]Hello?
[109:35.70]Q-I-A
[109:45.52]Dude, I'm getting achievements like crazy.
[109:49.40]Alright, so we have... Let's take a little bit of an indentary here, okay?
[109:53.19]I thought this was blood.
[109:54.01]This car was designed in MS Paint.
[110:02.81]Alright.
[110:09.67]Cool.
[110:11.13]Cool, yeah, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, right?
[110:13.20]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, right?
[110:14.80]Hello?
[110:15.56]Oh, here it comes.
[110:16.78]Hello?
[110:17.10]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[110:20.74]Is that because you want it to happen?
[110:22.42]No, I just was waiting for it to happen.
[110:24.92]Do it.
[110:25.18]It's not funny.
[110:27.02]Do it.
[110:27.28]That's the thing.
[110:27.66]You've done it every time.
[110:28.61]Do it.
[110:29.33]You're making me very uncomfortable.
[110:32.49]Do it.
[110:32.79]You do it every time.
[110:33.71]Do it.
[110:33.97]I'm just trying to clean up.
[110:38.39]I don't think I can keep working under these conditions.
[110:45.96]Can I go home?
[110:48.78]One time he doesn't use his, like, fucking electro board to make like a... I... I don't feel well.
[111:08.39]We're almost done.
[111:15.14]Are you going to check out that new game?
[111:17.24]Which new game?
[111:18.36]I don't know any of them.
[111:20.46]I've played quite a few new games.
[111:22.10]Which one?
[111:22.44]I don't know.
[111:23.98]Do you have any new games you're going to check out?
[111:26.50]Unreleased new games?
[111:30.41]No, not right now.
[111:32.83]Nothing new is coming out.
[111:35.49]There's a few things coming out.
[111:36.71]There's always things coming out, like every day.
[111:38.31]I think Super Sexy Maid 2 is out on Steam in a few days, or already.
[111:50.14]What?

[112:32.81]You did it.
[112:33.45]I'm telling mommy.
[112:34.17]I'm telling mommy.
[112:43.61]Get the hell away.
[112:44.76]We're doing this so stupidly.
[112:46.02]Put this in here.
[112:58.04]Where's Dad's floodlight?
[113:00.67]I need it.
[113:02.01]I'm getting Dad's floodlight for you.
[113:04.09]I know you are vision impaired.
[113:06.13]I don't need it.
[113:06.57]I don't need it.
[113:07.81]I don't need it.
[113:08.71]I thought you needed like a solar eclipse to be able to see anything.
[113:11.65]No, I don't need it.
[113:12.35]Okay.
[113:29.98]Mm-hmm.
[113:31.34]Clean.
[113:31.64]Except for me.
[113:38.70]And there is a stick in here.
[113:47.66]Am I a vampire?
[113:49.18]Holy fuck, there's so many of these here that I did not put here.
[113:52.86]That just surprised me how many you've put there.
[113:55.44]I thought it was broken.
[113:57.04]How many what?
[113:58.12]How many USB sticks?
[114:00.16]Oh, no.
[114:00.62]I've been doing my job.
[114:04.50]Oh, dude.
[114:05.00]Frying pan.
[114:07.80]No, no.
[114:08.28]There was nothing wrong with that.
[114:17.05]Why'd you do that?
[114:18.29]I want a new one.
[114:20.49]Use this one.
[114:21.79]Hold on.
[114:24.15]This one's good.
[114:30.13]Thank you.
[114:32.59]Now finish up.
[114:35.00]We're almost done with the house.
[114:36.38]The house is almost completely good.
[115:04.80]Why did that happen?
[115:07.56]Yeah, I wanted to pick up the fucking torso that was buried at the bottom of the barrel.
[115:12.22]I didn't want to pick up the barrel.
[115:13.52]I wanted to pick up the torso at the bottom.
[115:24.13]What is this?
[115:24.79]Make sure you hold shift when you're walking, too.
[115:29.49]What do you want to drop?
[115:30.33]What do you want to drop?
[115:34.07]I wouldn't want to drop it.
[115:40.45]I'll go gold on table.
[115:42.41]Gold on table.
[115:43.39]Okay.
[115:43.55]Interesting.
[115:45.19]You left some gold on the table, Jerma.
[115:49.03]That's your joke.
[115:50.88]That's not mine.
[115:53.12]If you want to make that, mute you and do that on your stream.
[115:57.78]Hello?
[116:02.84]Oh, cool.
[116:04.52]There it is.
[116:05.90]There it is.
[116:07.57]There it is.
[116:08.07]I watch any good TV lately?
[116:16.21]I thought that was a soundboard thing.
[116:19.40]It was a weird... Watch any good TV lately?
[116:22.68]It really was.
[116:23.36]It was like abrupt and weird.
[116:28.06]Have I watched any good TV lately?
[116:31.09]What's the last TV that I watched?
[116:37.23]I don't know.
[116:37.59]What's the last TV show that I actually watched?
[116:42.33]I'm asking you.
[116:43.49]You should have that information.
[116:45.50]I really don't know.
[116:47.76]Spider-Man?
[116:48.24]That's a movie.
[116:50.88]That's a movie.
[116:51.64]I'm not counting movies here.
[116:54.84]I haven't really watched any TV.
[117:01.17]Outside is good.
[117:02.61]Alright.
[117:05.95]We'll have to go through a little bit and check up on it.
[117:08.33]What about the garage?
[117:10.95]The garage was good.
[117:12.43]Is it completely good?
[117:14.02]I didn't detect any... It's the MS paint car that I wish we could trash.
[117:18.50]It looks like blood.
[117:20.88]No, no, no.
[117:21.60]That's Sting's car from WCW.
[117:25.54]Was his car MS paint, like airbrush drawn on?
[117:31.70]No.
[117:33.28]The car's awful.
[117:34.00]What's wrong with that car?
[117:36.98]What's the problem with that car?
[117:38.46]It's really ugly, but it's not that big of a deal.
[117:42.62]It's ruining my immersion.
[117:44.82]We gotta get a trash container in here.
[117:51.32]Okay, I'm on it, boss.
[117:53.36]And then... I think... Let me get the gross light.
[117:59.04]What's it called?
[117:59.64]The fluorescent light bulb?
[118:03.85]So we can look at the ground and be like, oh, gross!
[118:09.54]Behind you, where do you want this?
[118:12.58]In the living room.
[118:19.64]Now this is what happens when your landlord comes in and is looking for piss.
[118:24.43]That's what he's looking for.
[118:26.51]What happened over here?
[118:29.05]What?
[118:30.58]I'm just dealing with... Oh, there it is.
[118:32.78]Piss.
[118:42.23]Don't track.
[118:42.97]I don't track ever.
[118:47.59]Alright, so let's do this together.
[118:49.45]Why not?
[118:52.25]I've already put in like eight.
[118:53.93]Four hands are better than two, right?
[118:59.34]Thank you.
[118:59.66]Oh, let me get that for you.
[119:09.21]Put it down.
[119:09.53]Alright, do the first birthday.
[119:14.43]I can chug one of these wins.
[119:23.57]Oh, cool.
[119:25.42]Oh, I did it.
[119:35.27]Didn't you... I love how much you fucking hated what I just did.
[119:41.73]No, I... You hated it.
[119:43.17]You hated it.
[119:44.71]I respect the roleplay.
[119:50.87]Here's a question.
[119:52.65]Stale joke.
[119:56.61]What's your question?
[119:57.84]What's the, like, worst character you can think of on TV or movie?
[120:03.33]what would be your ideal worst character are we talking like things they did in this in the show that were bad or like their personality just like how bad of a cat like you don't care about they're just awful you know the worst character um I don't know like I can't think of like the character a character that I just hated um
[120:37.30]What do you got?
[120:37.96]I got nothing.
[120:41.23]I was talking about it the other night with my significant other.
[120:46.33]The worst character from any TV show that I've ever seen.
[120:48.27]Oh.
[120:53.41]She hates the lawyer from Jessica Jones.
[120:57.01]Specific.
[120:57.86]It's very specific.
[120:59.88]She said it was the worst character, so I was trying to come up with a worse one.
[121:04.00]Hmm.
[121:05.02]I forget what I came up with already.
[121:06.22]It was just last night, and I have no attention span.
[121:12.46]Oops.
[121:13.64]People saying Garfield?
[121:14.68]Garfield was a comic book before he was, like, a TV show.
[121:17.73]And the TV show was good.
[121:19.63]Garfield and Friends, that was not a bad show.
[121:23.71]You're smashing blood.
[121:25.23]What?
[121:27.53]You just destroyed that doorway.
[121:32.72]Um...
[121:35.94]Finn from the 100.
[121:37.00]That's a good one.
[121:38.10]That's good.
[121:38.78]I don't know.
[121:39.48]I don't watch that much TV.
[121:42.02]I don't.
[121:42.96]To have, like, a based on anything opinion here.
[121:48.63]Um... Do you, like... I don't know.
[121:54.09]I... I'm surprised you don't remember.
[121:56.39]I'm trying to start conversations with you, you know?
[121:58.75]Trying to, you know, liven the mood.
[122:01.17]The mood is very live.
[122:02.97]And all you have to say is... Oh, cool.
[122:04.65]Cool.
[122:06.48]I went the wrong way.
[122:10.29]Come on.
[122:11.15]Come on, dude.
[122:13.35]Why can't I play that back to you?
[122:14.85]Come on, dude.
[122:15.81]Come on.
[122:16.81]Because... You don't have the thing.
[122:20.35]You'd be more than welcome to do it if you had the thing.
[122:22.53]What about the pumpkins out here?
[122:29.40]We should probably set those up.
[122:33.24]Hello?
[122:33.54]Hello?
[122:37.53]I need some of these.
[122:39.79]Still lots of buckets out here to be disposed of.
[122:44.67]So do it yourself.
[122:52.28]At least it's good to know I have a future in being a janitor.
[122:55.40]I think I can do this.
[123:03.90]I'm stuck on this.

[127:03.78]You, like, made fun of me.
[127:06.44]You said I was acting like a six-year-old.
[127:10.50]No, I said you were... I said you were using wrestling moves on six-year-olds.
[127:16.53]Alright.
[127:17.17]Well, let's go ahead and move on from that conversation.
[127:19.51]I did rip my pants, actually.
[127:21.57]Yeah, you did rip your pants.
[127:22.91]That's actually true.
[127:25.46]Your voice, when you remembered, he did, he did.
[127:27.76]I can turn this on and off.
[127:28.52]No, he ripped his pants.
[127:29.24]It's not about me.
[127:30.12]He ripped his pants.
[127:30.78]He ripped his pants.
[127:31.40]It was embarrassing.
[127:34.77]Yep.
[127:39.38]Okay, for a second.
[127:41.78]For a second.
[127:43.92]I thought I... I thought I threw away X. And I was about to be like, oh fuck.
[127:50.79]Good thing I didn't throw away X. Yeah.
[127:55.23]They are shaped the same.
[127:56.43]Alright, so.
[128:03.68]How's the episode?
[128:04.32]So the vision...
[128:06.87]The vision.
[128:07.35]No, yeah, okay.
[128:08.81]You think I do embarrassing things?
[128:11.16]You not only have ripped your pants in front of me, you've also shit your pants on stream.
[128:18.86]So I think I get, like, times one million, like, points in the other direction.
[128:25.31]Yeah, but I won that quick play match.
[128:28.85]So...
[128:35.67]It's like, honest to God, the most fucking disgusting fucked up thing ever.
[128:43.82]Ever.
[128:44.60]Ever.
[128:50.84]It's, uh... What am I doing?
[128:52.14]I'm pretty low of you to judge another man's butthole.
[128:57.69]What is this, a vacuum?
[128:59.07]I'm sure yours has done some things it's not too proud of.
[129:01.25]How do I turn on the vacuum?
[129:04.10]Oh, yeah, not talking about this anymore.
[129:07.37]Oh, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[129:09.19]Hey, Jerry, come out here.
[129:13.35]Jerry, get out here.
[129:14.79]Hello?
[129:17.57]Get out the front door.
[129:19.68]What?
[129:20.48]Get out the front door, out the front door, quick.
[129:23.24]Why?
[129:24.14]Because you're about to see something amazing.
[129:27.42]Coming, coming, honey.
[129:29.40]I found the vacuum that plays music.
[129:34.09]Look, I'm jumping.
[129:34.73]I'm jumping.
[129:35.55]Can you see me?
[129:36.71]Look at your map.
[129:41.29]Come here.
[129:51.42]Okay, now you do the work while I'll be the support.
[129:57.40]I'm your healer.
[130:00.54]I'm leaving if you don't get rid of that.
[130:04.54]I was at a vacuum.
[130:10.80]Wait.
[130:12.08]Now we can't get it.
[130:13.08]I just realized what I'm doing.
[130:16.07]I threw some pumpkins out there earlier.
[130:22.15]You're going to get us in trouble.
[130:23.19]Don't do that.
[130:24.65]You think you can get one over the fence?
[130:26.40]I think so.
[130:26.70]We both get one throw.
[130:28.18]One throw to get it over the fence?
[130:29.86]Yeah, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[130:32.06]Into, like, crabby Carol's yard?
[130:35.69]Yeah, fuck Carol.
[130:39.49]Holy shit, I just, that was, like, I, there's nobody's gonna, I just went to the driving range.
[130:45.23]No, I'm sorry, I went to the driving range.
[130:50.27]Hey, you wanna take this and, like, throw it out?
[130:53.36]Dude, I was on the roof!
[130:59.43]Oh, not even close.
[131:01.76]I'm going over Carol's roof.
[131:03.14]Check this shit out.
[131:08.18]Where'd it go?
[131:09.84]You got it over the house.
[131:10.80]Did it go so far over the house?
[131:12.06]It didn't go straight.
[131:12.96]It went off to the right.
[131:18.45]You got in my way.
[131:19.75]I don't know where mine went.
[131:21.29]I'm gonna assume I hit the moon.
[131:25.39]Okay.
[131:26.45]Why do I still hear the music?
[131:32.47]Why is music coming from the house?
[131:35.61]Oh, there's a new one over here.
[131:38.32]Get rid of this fucking thing.
[131:45.00]Does it spawn?
[131:48.10]Now I miss the music.
[131:55.28]Alright, back upstairs.
[131:56.16]God damn it.
[131:58.50]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[131:59.24]Take this trash out.
[132:00.02]Take the trash outside.
[132:00.94]When do I get my obligated?
[132:02.79]I'm like, ugh.
[132:08.45]Just running and heaving the trash into the street.
[132:10.19]Again, that grosses me out more than the bodies.
[132:16.55]What do I do with my trash?
[132:28.39]Oh my god, this music is like all in my left ear.
[132:35.70]Where are you?
[132:36.46]Are you up in the... I'm in the backyard.
[132:38.55]What are we doing?
[132:39.31]Alright, go upstairs.
[132:42.07]We need to do upstairs.
[132:42.57]I'm getting a bucket.
[132:43.29]Is that okay?
[132:44.18]That's fine.
[132:57.80]Where are you?
[132:58.84]I'm coming upstairs right now.
[133:06.75]This music is so loud and annoying.
[133:09.03]Like, why'd you have to do this?
[133:11.35]The fuck?
[133:12.07]Turn your music down.
[133:15.05]It's really not that hard to turn your music down.
[133:17.11]No.
[133:18.05]It's the principle.
[133:21.26]Where is this coming from?
[133:24.76]It's in the stone.
[133:25.20]It's, like, in the wall.
[133:28.75]Don't.
[133:29.85]Get that trash out of here.
[133:30.95]What?
[133:35.17]Do you think I'm getting crabby, Carol's front yard?
[133:47.44]We're never gonna complete the level now.
[133:53.56]Hope you're happy.
[133:55.75]No, no music.
[133:56.95]Quiet.
[133:57.31]I want complete silence.
[133:58.81]Alright.
[133:59.37]So let's let's take this party upstairs.
[134:03.56]I will bring a couple of buckets.
[134:05.72]Oh, yeah.
[134:06.12]What else are you going to do?
[134:09.96]Oh, relax.
[134:13.60]Relax.
[134:15.32]How many buckets?
[134:18.04]Two.
[134:20.98]Oh, yeah.
[134:30.85]Do you have one of those trash compactors up there?
[134:33.59]Yeah.
[134:34.47]There really is just party music playing.
[134:37.89]Why is it in the house?
[134:40.22]I turned my music off.
[134:41.22]I don't know.
[134:41.74]It was like in a wall and I couldn't find it.
[134:43.14]Alright, got two buckets of water.
[134:54.57]Which room are you in?
[134:56.41]I'm in the hallway.
[134:58.58]Okay.
[134:59.64]Please be careful.
[135:04.56]Are you trying to do something dumb?
[135:08.14]Because we need these buckets.
[135:11.15]And you just came over and whacked me.
[135:17.01]The music's getting louder.
[135:19.69]Yeah.
[135:20.65]Alright, so which one are we doing?
[135:22.21]Excuse me.
[135:22.65]This one?
[135:25.71]This room is nearly done.
[135:27.73]Wasn't this a competition room?
[135:30.43]It might have been.
[135:32.35]No, you did the other room.
[135:33.41]This closet is bad.
[135:34.39]Ah, fuck, dude.
[135:34.83]What's up?
[135:53.06]Are you good?
[135:53.68]What happened?
[135:54.36]I'm good, I'm good.
[135:55.90]This one, I can take this one.
[136:01.86]It's just blood, a little bit of guts.
[136:03.95]I guess.
[136:04.79]There's a note too.
[136:05.47]Where does this lead?
[136:12.69]This window.
[136:18.49]We're good.
[136:19.07]I'm good.
[136:19.29]My room's clean.
[136:19.75]I beat you.
[136:19.99]My room's clean.
[136:20.63]I beat you.
[136:21.55]My room's clean.
[136:22.08]I beat you.
[136:22.46]I'm trying to just dump you out the window.
[136:24.10]Which window is near a thing?
[136:26.28]No, that's... I think I can get it.
[136:30.58]Give me a hand here.
[136:32.22]No.
[136:34.26]I have my own duties.
[136:36.18]Got it.
[136:36.52]Come on.
[136:37.36]Do it.
[136:38.66]Do what?
[136:40.20]I'm in trouble.
[136:41.84]Coming, coming.
[136:42.88]I'm coming to bail you out.
[136:44.48]I don't know.
[136:46.72]I don't know what's going on.
[136:50.46]Did you do that?
[136:52.21]Do what?
[136:53.43]Weirdly enough, the whole game is procedurally generated.
[136:56.89]So we kind of have an issue out here.
[137:03.67]I did not do that.
[137:05.15]It's procedurally generated.
[137:07.01]Hold on, I got this.
[137:09.43]Did you just kill me?
[137:12.30]You just killed me.
[137:13.78]How did you kill me?
[137:15.97]What?
[137:17.31]I don't know.
[137:17.77]You just goomba stomped me and broke my neck.
[137:19.83]I got her off the roof.
[137:21.51]Why did I die?
[137:25.97]No time for your jokes.
[137:27.11]Why is this number four?
[137:32.63]There is no joke there.
[137:34.17]You actually jumped on my head and broke my neck.
[137:36.85]That's not funny.
[137:37.85]Please don't imply that I would be involved in any tomfoolery.
[137:43.35]Alright, you knocked her off?
[137:44.72]My mom's watching, okay?
[137:46.32]Where is she?
[137:49.50]What?
[137:50.24]Wait, did you knock her off the front or back?
[137:52.52]My mom?
[137:53.32]I threw her off the front.
[137:55.34]Stop tracking it.
[137:57.27]You're tracking it.
[137:58.63]I don't see her.
[137:59.21]Where'd you knock her off?
[138:03.07]She was in the bushes.
[138:03.91]I got her.
[138:05.51]There's still a spot of blood up there that I can't get.
[138:07.57]Where'd this guy come from?
[138:23.89]Thanks for nothing, game.
[138:25.13]Thanks for nothing.
[138:26.05]When do we get guns?
[138:27.57]You don't get guns.
[138:29.39]Not every game has to have a gun.
[138:32.45]Not every game has to have, like, get on the cart and shoot the gun.
[138:38.12]God.
[138:42.80]I don't know.
[138:43.72]I'm a back-in-the-day gamer.
[138:48.84]A purist, if you will.
[138:50.72]Why not?
[138:53.85]Alright, we are getting very, very close, my friend.
[138:56.09]Fucking take my buckets!
[139:04.44]Hello?
[139:06.60]I thought that was you, but it was me.
[139:12.28]I thought you were doing a, quote, Jerma impression.
[139:16.58]Hello?
[139:18.29]No.
[139:18.51]Hello?

[139:29.25]Fucking kid thinks he's funny.
[139:32.84]That's when you're walking down the street and 50% of the people are Jermos.
[139:39.38]Did you see that video?
[139:42.06]No, I didn't see it.
[139:43.58]Where else would I have come up with this if I didn't?
[139:45.66]You think I have an imagination?
[139:50.04]Something in the attic.
[139:52.74]Something in the attic.
[139:55.79]Is it creepy?
[139:56.63]Something in the attic.
[139:57.41]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[139:59.63]Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.
[140:00.51]Come here, come here, come here.

[140:12.22]It's gonna work.
[140:14.24]Oh, shit.
[140:14.74]Alright, bring it to the bathroom.
[140:17.17]Oh, it's a weed.
[140:18.35]I thought we were going to try and go down the stairs on it.
[140:20.77]No.
[140:20.83]Alright.
[140:22.72]So authentic people have died on this.
[140:25.16]Vooja.

[141:08.00]Okay, hand back on.
[141:10.42]Okay.
[141:10.56]Okay.

[141:57.57]Okay.
[141:57.97]Okay.
[141:58.21]It's down.
[141:58.63]It's down.
[141:59.61]Hold on.

[142:15.68]It's too dark.
[142:17.38]It's too dark in the house.
[142:18.48]I can't see.
[142:22.38]My camera's turned way fucking down.
[142:24.06]Alright, where's the bathroom?
[142:26.05]I need blood.
[142:26.89]Give me blood.
[142:27.41]I need blood.

[143:02.41]Spirits, are you in the room with us?
[143:06.33]Dude, this is fucking freaky.
[143:07.31]Is this you doing that?
[143:09.17]I don't think it's me doing it.
[143:11.59]It's on yes.
[143:13.91]Oh my god.

[143:17.99]What the fuck is happening there?
[143:19.70]Okay.

[144:30.41]I think that's the demon's name.
[144:33.47]Gamsix.
[144:34.07]Gamsix.
[144:34.83]Oh, terrible demon of ours.
[144:37.71]What do you want us to do?
[144:48.26]Okay, sorry.
[144:51.80]Gamsix, I forget where the letter is, Gamsix.
[144:55.42]I don't remember where the letter is in the alphabet because we're upside down.
[144:59.38]Gamsix, please move me in the right direction if you could, please.
[145:03.23]Gamsix.
[145:03.93]Oh, whoa.
[145:04.89]Oh, fuck.

[145:10.69]Q. Are you moving this?
[145:16.46]You?
[145:17.68]Can we?
[145:20.06]There's an eye.
[145:20.64]I think that's an eye.

[145:51.61]Are you moving this, dude?
[145:53.27]Dude, stop me moving this!
[145:57.16]It's not me!

[145:59.74]Oh my god, is this the Demon Lord game, Sooks?
[146:02.44]Dude, are you picking this up, did you move this?
[146:08.22]Dude, I'm walking down the stairs, are you walking down the stairs right now?
[146:11.10]I'm not, am I?
[146:15.01]Good job.
[146:16.01]Oh shit.
[146:17.07]You hit the first funny part.
[146:19.81]Are you moving this?
[146:26.50]I gotta turn my game back up.
[146:31.54]What was it, at one?
[146:32.30]Dude, are you moving this?
[146:38.38]I'm not moving this.
[146:39.28]Are you sure?
[146:40.06]Something's fucking weird.
[146:42.12]I'm not moving this.
[146:46.37]Alright, get, move.
[146:49.14]I'm not moving.
[146:52.08]Let's go clean the house.
[146:57.36]Why did you have to bring that up here?
[147:03.28]So that you can see what you're doing.
[147:05.36]Thanks.
[147:11.58]That actually is way too bright, though, for real.
[147:13.06]Like, get rid of this.
[147:17.50]This is as good as Seinfeld.
[147:20.16]Where did that go?
[147:22.29]How are you still holding that?
[147:24.07]You can't take it out of my hand.
[147:25.41]My hands are too strong.
[147:26.25]I have pure titanium grip strength.
[147:28.59]Okay.
[147:28.73]The bathroom's clean.
[147:30.79]No one's ever taken anything from my hand.
[147:33.39]The bathroom's clean.
[147:34.93]My hands are massive.
[147:36.71]And they have, like, hairy knuckles.
[147:38.63]Veins popping out.
[147:42.95]Gross.
[147:43.24]Gross.
[147:45.68]Yeah, but you think it'd be nice to be held by these hands.
[147:48.02]I got veinier hands than you, I guarantee it.
[147:50.80]I'm vascular.
[147:52.04]I have the veiniest hands in the world, I swear to God.
[147:56.40]Let's compare.
[147:57.00]Come here, show me your hands.
[147:57.86]Honestly, if... You would think that I was an old lady if you saw my hands up close.
[148:02.95]That's not vascular, that's wrinkly.
[148:05.25]No, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.
[148:07.09]Like, my veins pop the fuck out of my hands.
[148:14.39]Okay, you win.
[148:17.56]We should compare hands.
[148:29.38]It's the music that's doing it to me, too.
[148:31.61]Show hands.
[148:33.71]Are you on camera?
[148:34.89]Are you, like, decent right now?
[148:36.93]My camera isn't plugged in.
[148:38.57]Well, they're not that vanny right now.
[148:41.27]They kind of are.
[148:43.63]Should I prove it?
[148:46.72]Prove it.
[148:47.14]Prove it.
[148:48.68]Prove how vain your hand is.
[148:50.00]I'm opening the stream.
[148:50.98]I need to see.
[148:52.08]Prove it.
[148:52.68]Yeah, I know.
[148:54.18]I'm wearing the same shirt as I was yesterday.
[148:55.66]Deal with it.
[148:56.16]It's 100 degrees.
[148:58.54]Wait.
[148:59.42]It being 100 degrees is why you're wearing the same shirt.
[149:02.79]Look at that.
[149:05.11]Look at those.
[149:05.53]Look at that.
[149:07.33]Are you shitting me, dude?
[149:11.33]Let me get a light on that.
[149:12.61]Get a light on it.
[149:15.33]No, you're not.
[149:16.33]Hold on.
[149:17.47]You turned the light.
[149:18.41]You got the wrong side.
[149:20.63]No, no, no.
[149:20.95]That's towards you.
[149:22.45]Towards me.
[149:25.77]Not in my fucking eyes.
[149:28.64]Okay.
[149:29.50]Can you see?
[149:29.84]Yeah.
[149:32.74]No, my hands are way bigger.
[149:34.74]Like, hairier.
[149:37.18]More defined and more vascular.
[149:40.20]And thank you.
[149:40.56]Put the fucking light down, dick.
[149:42.45]Like, you still... It's right in my face.
[149:45.88]Never letting go of this.
[149:46.82]Asshole.
[149:47.48]You can't get inside of my hands.
[149:48.42]Not with trickery.
[149:49.79]Not with force.
[149:51.17]Ooh, that was an explosion.
[149:54.73]Oh, is that my switch that went all the way down?
[149:56.11]No, it's not.
[149:56.51]Thank God.
[149:57.05]I was about to be fucking sad.
[149:58.03]Look at those hands.
[150:05.08]Wait a second.
[150:06.90]Are you moving this?
[150:08.56]I'm not moving that.
[150:12.50]What about now?
[150:14.02]You moving this?
[150:14.96]No, you are.
[150:18.80]Get me out of the bathroom, please.
[150:21.03]I'm not moving that.
[150:22.41]I'm not moving it.
[150:23.05]Get me out of the bathroom.
[150:29.13]I get you to wipe your ass.
[150:30.13]Dude, we're almost done.
[150:33.54]We're at the finish line, and we're wiping each other's asses.
[150:36.36]Alright.
[150:43.50]I've reached the level of, like, we're so close to being done that we can't finish because we're so close.
[150:51.31]That's why we can't finish.
[150:52.43]What is this?
[150:54.91]We still have that whole other house.
[150:56.82]What is this?
[150:58.32]Oh!
[150:59.16]Scary!
[151:00.66]Yeah, there's a whole other house here, right?
[151:06.90]Is that a book?
[151:14.96]Alright, I cleaned up the book.
[151:17.16]Alright, this is the house.

[159:27.54]Yeah, no, no, no.
[159:28.12]For real, though, we have to get this done quickly because our boss was going to write us up if we didn't, so... Oh, what?
[159:35.66]Like, I quit.
[159:37.30]What?
[159:38.68]I quit.
[159:38.96]What do you mean you quit?
[159:39.74]What are you talking about?
[159:40.84]I'm not going to get written up by that shithead.
[159:43.86]No, dude.
[159:44.40]That balding, middle-aged piece of trash.
[159:46.82]I don't think you understand.
[159:47.46]Can't even please his wife.
[159:52.20]I'm sorry that you don't get this.
[159:53.82]Yeah, I saw his computer open the other day, like the weirdest Craigslist wanted ads I've ever read.
[160:01.08]Just turn on my stream, turn on my stream.
[160:03.06]Turn on my stream for a second.
[160:04.10]Turn on my stream for a second.
[160:04.76]It's important.
[160:05.46]Turn on my stream.
[160:05.92]Watch my stream.
[160:07.48]We have to get this done in 20 minutes.
[160:10.60]You know what I mean?
[160:11.16]Like, we have to, like... Ghost.
[160:16.96]I can't... 20 minutes, man.
[160:18.80]Are you watching?
[160:19.28]20 minutes.
[160:22.47]20 minutes or... I don't... Like, I'm watching you, but wow.
[160:27.35]You're just staring at me.
[160:29.19]We're gonna eat the farm in 20 minutes, dude.
[160:30.49]Fucking just start cleaning now.
[160:32.44]You ever see American Psycho?
[160:43.56]He's gonna wipe your neck.
[160:48.38]What?
[160:53.42]I didn't do the one finger.
[160:56.00]I did, like, the whole palm.
[160:59.32]He's going to wipe your neck.
[161:00.62]Oh, no.
[161:00.92]Okay.
[161:01.42]Hey, be careful.
[161:01.98]He's going to go, like, you got to get, like, some fucking fry oil on your chin.
[161:07.73]He's going to wipe off.
[161:09.95]I'm okay with that.
[161:23.58]Okay, so how do you want to do this?
[161:27.88]Dude, I don't know.
[161:30.96]What is left to do?
[161:32.04]It's the attic.
[161:33.09]The attic and then the USBs.
[161:35.15]Give me the USBs.
[161:37.11]Stop with this USB.
[161:38.41]I quit.
[161:38.95]I will quit.
[161:39.65]Don't quit.
[161:40.73]Get out here and come out the door where the pumpkins fall.
[161:44.03]I will destroy you.
[161:48.99]Get out here.
[161:49.67]I'm gonna do one more USB joke and I am spreading my blood everywhere.
[161:55.10]Get out of the house right now.
[161:56.70]I'm out.
[161:58.26]No, I mean like the other side.
[161:59.46]The side where the pumpkins fall.
[162:05.26]Guillermo, listen to me.
[162:06.32]Listen to me real good.
[162:08.72]I'm gonna cut myself open and just crawl along the floor.
[162:17.18]Real sicko shit.
[162:18.68]Alright.
[162:19.42]How about this?
[162:20.52]I have a job for you, okay?
[162:23.72]In this house somewhere, somewhere, there's a fucking treasure.
[162:28.30]And if you can find the treasure in... 20 minutes.
[162:35.67]Then... No, less than that.
[162:37.61]Five minutes.
[162:38.59]Then I will give you... I will give you $100.
[162:43.67]What is the treasure?
[162:45.23]The USBs that I hid.
[162:47.42]Okay.
[162:50.38]Good luck.
[162:50.68]And I have five minutes.
[162:51.56]You have five minutes to make $100.
[162:52.78]Okay, chat, where do you put him?
[162:55.84]You can't do that.
[162:56.48]That doesn't work.
[162:56.98]Okay, I can't do that.
[162:58.32]Close your chat right now.
[163:00.19]Okay.
[163:00.99]No, that's unbelievable.
[163:02.17]He's cheating.
[163:03.63]You have five minutes.
[163:04.17]I'm counting right now.
[163:06.75]I'm looking at the clock.
[163:25.32]Found it.
[163:28.14]That's one USB that's outside, not the, like, 40 that I hid.
[163:31.80]100 bucks, please!
[163:33.80]No, I said find the USBs that I hid, not find a USB on the ground.
[163:37.57]You hid it right here.
[163:39.01]No, this is not like an Easter egg hunt for four-year-olds.
[163:41.57]This is... No, it's going to be harder than that.
[163:44.71]It wasn't harder than that, though.
[163:46.39]It was right here.
[163:47.29]You felt like I would see it in the grass because it's green.
[163:51.07]You only have three more minutes left.
[163:53.46]That is not how quickly time goes by.
[163:55.51]Yes it is.
[164:02.75]Nothing in there.
[164:03.29]FUCK!
[164:07.08]He runs!
[164:11.02]You'll never get somebody!
[164:11.90]You'll never get somebody!
[164:21.17]What are you gonna spend your hundred dollars on?
[164:22.65]You read that!
[164:23.95]You read that!
[164:28.32]Alright, well, can you pick those up?
[164:30.44]Hello?
[164:32.92]Can I- I don't know where they go!
[164:37.06]They were in one central location.
[164:44.77]Why is there another body in here?
[164:47.73]I don't understand how this is... Was he in the attic?
[164:50.93]Yes.
[164:54.86]How about I hide the USBs, and then you have to go find them?
[164:58.44]Okay, that sounds fun.
[164:59.82]And then it'll be even.
[165:01.34]Sure.
[165:02.54]Okay.
[165:03.52]I want to clarify... To find them, you, like, need to, like, pick them up and hold them and prove to me that you found them.
[165:11.43]Um... You can just... I have a stream going right now.
[165:16.76]Yeah, you do.
[165:18.71]You're going to have to prove to your stream by holding one of the USBs that you find the USBs that I hid.
[165:23.32]Okay.
[165:25.30]Just one?
[165:28.06]Or do I have to find them all?
[165:29.68]You have to find, like, I'm hiding the stash.
[165:32.52]Okay.
[165:33.92]So as long as I find the stash, that's in quotes.
[165:37.15]Yeah.
[165:37.95]Yeah, and you can prove that you found it by, like, picking it up and showing I have found it.
[165:42.29]Okay.
[165:42.81]Okay.
[165:44.69]Yeah, whatever.
[165:45.99]I can do it.
[165:46.39]Do I need to hide or something?
[165:47.25]Do I want me to go over here?
[165:47.87]You need to, you know what?
[165:49.51]Oh, it's clown on the town this?
[165:50.60]You turn around and count to 15.
[165:51.66]Okay.
[165:52.02]Are you ready?
[165:55.12]Yep.
[165:55.28]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[166:16.70]And?
[166:19.79]Good luck.
[166:20.43]You didn't even walk over here.
[166:23.63]I hit him.
[166:39.06]Hold on.
[166:39.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[166:40.02]No, nobody move.
[166:41.18]Nobody fucking move.
[166:48.06]Give me one!
[166:49.20]Is it in there?
[166:50.22]It's not in there!
[166:50.93]It's the stash!
[166:51.65]That's the stash!
[166:53.77]Come on!
[166:54.91]One of them had to have fallen off.
[167:02.47]No!
[167:03.49]At least one didn't make the journey.
[167:09.72]God damn it.
[167:14.62]That was so sad what just happened.
[167:17.77]Okay, so... That's 200.
[167:20.02]There was no monetary bet there.
[167:46.43]Uh, as reliable as ever.
[167:51.26]Good old Jerma.
[167:59.01]Hey, Star.
[168:00.21]Yeah?
[168:01.85]Found something.
[168:05.83]That's not the stash.
[168:07.53]There are three here.
[168:11.36]There are three that fell from some portal and made their way in here.
[168:17.00]That's a stash.
[168:17.82]I just put them here so that you wouldn't destroy them.
[168:20.28]Hey, come over this way.
[168:21.08]Hey, come over here.
[168:22.22]That is classified as a stash.
[168:24.54]Over here.
[168:25.13]There's also a stash, but it was the stash, Jerma.
[168:34.67]Why am I doing that?
[168:35.23]We need those.
[168:35.73]Alright.
[168:37.27]I swear to God.
[168:38.55]Okay, so, um... Let's finish up.
[168:42.55]Oh yeah, that's right.
[168:43.31]You've ruined everything.
[168:44.96]You've put... You won't stare at this cat.
[168:51.58]This is like a fucking haunted image.
[168:53.04]If you stare at this picture for more than a minute, you get haunted for the rest of your life.
[168:58.12]You won't do it.
[169:00.74]Holy shit.
[169:01.62]You're just disrespecting the fucking cat.
[169:05.94]Do it.
[169:06.26]No, no, do it.
[169:06.82]Do it.
[169:08.02]If you stare at a black cat for more than a minute, you get bad luck for like five years.
[169:13.81]Will you do it?
[169:14.21]I'm doing it.
[169:16.17]Candyman.
[169:17.03]Candyman.
[169:17.61]Don't do that.
[169:18.19]Don't do that.
[169:18.83]I don't want you to do that.
[169:20.19]I'm not in the same room, therefore I'm not in the same zone.
[169:26.12]Whatever you do, I'm not in that room.
[169:36.58]But I'm looking at it too.
[169:55.51]I can't believe you actually looked at it.
[169:59.60]That was a mistake.
[170:01.36]Shouldn't have done that.
[170:06.52]Are we still on call?
[170:12.68]No, he didn't do the thing where he just leaves, right?
[170:16.59]Did he leave?
[170:17.01]He left.
[170:21.17]No, he didn't.
[170:23.17]He's here.
[170:24.99]You can't fool me.
[170:25.69]You're here.
[170:28.17]You can't fool me.
[170:29.32]You're there.
[170:29.88]I know you're there.
[170:31.10]He's gone.
[170:31.84]He entered this room, too.
[170:43.48]God damn it.
[170:45.18]I gave him an out.
[170:46.48]And he took the opportunity.
[170:47.54]He was looking for an opportunity.
[170:49.96]And he found it.
[170:58.59]I should have told him, like, look at it for four hours.
[171:05.55]Well, that was fun.
[171:07.25]That was Star.
[171:08.33]Ster on Twitch.
[171:10.63]He's still streaming.
[171:12.27]He's still streaming.
[171:16.36]What is he doing right now?
[171:25.53]He's offline.
[171:26.19]Alright, well... Um... This is supposed to be co-op day.
[171:34.31]I'm like Matrix dodging bullets here.
[171:38.30]Internet sucks.
[171:40.00]Executive Assault 2 doesn't work.
[171:42.32]Star looked at the cat picture for more than a minute.
[171:45.40]That's three strikes.
[171:47.59]Time to do tier lists.
[171:58.77]Alright, let me... Let me just take a break.
[172:01.72]I've been live for about four hours now, so... Maybe more than that.
[172:05.86]The stream turned off like three times.
[172:08.96]I have no idea how long I've been live for.
[172:10.44]It's been probably four or five hours or so.
[172:13.08]But...
[172:15.19]I'm going to burp.
[172:16.37]We'll come back.
[172:17.00]We'll do the tier lists.
[172:22.98]And I'll see you in... Not even three.
[172:25.08]No.
[172:26.68]The stream turned off like three times.
[172:30.20]How long has it actually been?
[172:42.30]Let me see.
[172:50.67]25 minutes.
[172:55.31]No, let's see, how many VODs are there in this stream?
[172:58.35]No, let's see, how many VODs are there in this stream?
[173:00.05]Oh, yeah, no, this has been much longer than that.
[173:01.81]No, let's see, how many VODs are there in this stream?
[173:03.09]Oh, yeah, no, this has been... One hour thirty.
[173:05.49]Oh, yeah, no, this has been... One hour thirty.
[173:06.69]Four hours.
[173:07.81]One hour thirty.
[173:08.57]Four hours.
[173:08.93]One hour thirty.
[173:09.85]Four hours.
[173:10.85]One hour thirty.
[173:11.65]Four hours.
[173:11.93]Star just hosted me.
[173:12.51]Thank you for the call, Star.
[173:13.87]Four hours.
[173:22.80]Oops.
[173:23.84]Oops.
[173:24.18]Oops.
[173:25.12]Whoops.
[173:28.18]Whoops.
[173:33.09]How do I actually turn this off?
[173:36.11]How do I actually turn this off?
[173:37.25]Why is this playing?
[173:37.97]I don't have one window.
[173:38.53]I actually don't have one.
[173:39.15]How do I actually turn this off?
[173:40.29]Why is this playing?
[173:41.01]I don't have one window.
[173:41.57]I actually don't have one.
[173:42.19]How do I actually turn this off?
[173:43.33]I'm going to turn my capture screen on to turn my lights on.
[173:44.81]I'm going to turn my capture screen on to turn my lights on.
[173:48.53]I'm going to turn my capture screen on to turn my lights on.
[173:51.58]I'm going to turn my capture screen on to turn my lights on.
[173:54.62]I'm going to turn my capture screen on to turn my lights on.
[174:15.79]What?
[174:18.45]Oh, there it is.
[174:19.71]Okay, I was on a different... I was on my videos tab.
[174:23.13]And it was still playing the stream, even though I was on the videos tab, somehow.
[174:29.03]Okay.
[174:30.23]I'll be right back.
[174:32.97]I'm gonna just go to the bathroom, and we'll do some stuff.
[174:36.62]See you soon.
