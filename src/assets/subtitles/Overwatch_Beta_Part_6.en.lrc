[ve:60.16.100]

[00:09.95]Rated mature.
[00:12.69]Rated mature.
[00:16.12]Only for a mature audience.
[00:33.21]Greetings.
[00:36.34]So Overwatch got a pretty large update yesterday, last night.
[00:43.35]Figured I would play it Super Shimada brothers, this is the Genji and Hanzo only
[00:55.42]Maybe I'll do that later.
[00:56.88]I don't want to start with that.
[01:01.83]I'm ready.
[01:04.08]I don't want to do training.
[01:04.92]I'm ready.
[01:06.57]And do not ask me again.
[01:10.35]Yeah, they added the Tavern Brawl to Overwatch.
[01:14.60]And they also did something crazy to Zenyatta.
[01:17.09]I want to see just how drastic of a change it is.
[01:22.01]Ah, the French champagne.
[01:26.95]has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[01:29.69]You are in with the two months.
[01:31.28]Thanks a lot, dude.
[01:33.25]You are in with the two months.
[01:34.07]Thanks a lot, man.
[01:37.23]Is this new?
[01:37.75]I don't remember this poster being here.
[01:43.61]Huh.
[01:45.85]I guess you don't have to be in skirmish either, right?
[01:48.32]Can't you like skip skirmish?
[01:50.87]Take a look at the skin.
[01:51.49]It actually shows what skin you have in the lower left now.
[01:55.25]But the Zenyatta change, the one that I'm talking about, is apparently his Orb of Harmony
[02:00.99]is not as good as it used to be.
[02:03.53]You can't just throw it on somebody and forget about it.
[02:07.56]I can give you an indication.
[02:09.18]There's nobody else even here.
[02:11.03]But now, when you do Orb of Harmony to somebody,
[02:14.10]If you lose line of sight with that person for three seconds, it comes back to you.
[02:19.37]So... That's kind of the reason why I liked Zenyatta.
[02:24.03]is you were able to play the heal game more passively and you could go more offensive with it.
[02:32.77]But whatever.
[02:34.44]And this is the new map.
[02:36.07]First game on the new map I've never even played.
[02:37.84]Big Earls.
[02:38.52]We're gonna go to Big Earls.
[02:44.44]Big Earls.
[02:45.61]That's like one of my old screen names.
[02:52.38]Might as well just be Mercy at that point.
[02:53.76]Yeah, I don't...
[02:55.59]I can't really form an opinion of it yet because I have not played since the patch.
[02:59.48]This is my first game with the patch, first game playing.
[03:03.95]So I will make my decision if I'm upset or not in about probably 10 minutes.
[03:11.41]So let's see.
[03:13.00]There's the Orb of Harmony.
[03:13.90]Let's lose line of sight.
[03:15.38]One, two, three.
[03:19.12]Yeah, it's back.
[03:21.89]Let's see what happens if we try it again.
[03:23.46]One.
[03:24.23]Two.
[03:25.19]Three.
[03:26.28]Four.
[03:27.05]Well, it's about... Let's see.
[03:27.91]It's...
[03:30.06]It's a little more than three seconds, but that still sucks.
[03:33.23]It comes back.
[03:35.19]Yeah.
[03:39.25]I don't really- I'm not sure if I'm gonna like this because
[03:43.63]I guess if you just keep peeking, let's see, one, two.
[03:46.55]One, two, three.
[03:50.71]One, two, three.
[03:53.62]As long as you can see the person, the countdown doesn't start.
[03:58.84]But that's still...
[04:01.01]That almost promotes you to just stay behind a tank and just always look at a tank.
[04:05.75]For instance, I can't throw it on this Genji and let him do his thing for a little bit while I go do something else.
[04:11.62]I don't know.
[04:12.50]I'll reserve my judgments for a little bit.
[04:16.48]But this map is pretty interesting.
[04:25.44]See, it's on him right now.
[04:26.41]As long as I guess you can peek around a corner.
[04:37.39]They changed the outlines of names and stuff too, which is good.
[04:40.10]This is a Pay Love map too.
[04:47.48]I'm getting some real TF2 vibes from this map.
[04:50.37]Just like the actual color schemes of everything.
[04:53.32]This is very Badwater-esque, in my opinion.
[04:56.48]Which is not a terrible thing.
[04:59.56]Alright, let's put on that Genji.
[05:10.67]Shit.
[05:11.33]Now, does Orbit Discord come off too if it's three seconds?
[05:14.20]It does.
[05:15.05]It does.
[05:16.39]Okay, well that's...
[05:20.59]That's something as well, I guess.
[05:30.92]See if I can just kill this guy.
[05:36.86]That didn't kill him.
[05:37.95]That was like a full-on shot right in his stomach.
[05:42.39]Good old TF2 desert map.
[05:43.98]Yeah, I know.
[05:48.26]I mean, I guess it's not the worst thing in the world, because considering it hasn't really reared its ugly head yet.
[05:56.57]But for instance, I'm going to lose it on that guy, which I would love to keep it on him.
[06:00.72]I would like to have been able to keep it on him if he was going to fight that other Genji or something, you know?
[06:06.61]But we shall continue to test it.
[06:09.91]Because that's what we're doing.
[06:10.78]We're testing.
[06:24.55]Still alive, right?
[06:25.39]Holy shit.
[06:26.31]You're still back here.
[06:30.59]Okay, we're fine.
[06:31.25]No, we're not.
[06:31.78]There's a Pharah here.
[06:32.80]Not fine.
[06:36.29]Not fine, we're dead.
[06:42.26]Yeah, there's new assist and kill techs.
[06:44.23]There's new gold medals.
[06:45.14]They changed them again.
[06:46.83]They changed the medal system again.
[06:52.47]I can do that too!
[07:10.70]Damn it, he's almost dead.
[07:11.64]He's dead.
[07:13.50]Did I change my sensitivity?
[07:14.98]I feel like it's not where it should be.
[07:17.65]I think... Oh, a star was here.
[07:19.38]That's right.
[07:19.80]Star was here like two days ago.
[07:22.05]Did he make my sensitivity something else?
[07:24.65]Don't have time to look at it.
[07:25.80]Oh, thank God they added the checkpoint markers.
[07:37.80]Get line of sight on them.
[07:40.03]It almost promotes you having to follow people around too.
[07:42.70]Which I guess as a support you're kind of supposed to do stuff like that.
[07:48.08]But I don't...
[07:50.79]I don't know.
[07:54.84]It's almost like I feel more obligated now to have to be near people, which I don't really like that.
[08:03.75]Let me change my sensitivity.
[08:06.35]No, it's 14.
[08:09.42]Felt a little low for some reason.
[08:17.64]What did I get?
[08:18.33]Oh, I gotta play the game.
[08:18.95]I gotta look.
[08:21.35]Well played.
[08:21.84]What was that?
[08:32.51]No, let me get him!
[08:37.15]So what was that, like, well-played thing?
[08:39.14]What's going on?
[08:40.53]Are there, like, can you send people greeting cards?
[08:58.87]These new metal looks...
[09:02.28]I feel like this is like Candy Crush.
[09:04.82]These new metals are very Match 3-esque.
[09:08.35]Don't you want to just move this one over here so you can get the three bonus and so they fall down?
[09:17.01]Am I going to stream Dark Souls 3?
[09:18.88]Probably not.
[09:24.78]Probably not.
[09:29.61]It feels a little bit better.
[09:30.48]I don't know, I was just barely off on a lot of things.
[09:41.38]I'm pretty sure they messed with the sensitivity stuff in general.
[09:44.43]Oh.
[09:45.88]Okay, well.
[09:48.42]Interesting.
[09:55.50]Now, Dark Souls 3 is one of those games that I'm just going to play it on my own.
[09:59.80]Because I do not do well when I'm being watched in games like that.
[10:05.25]I have to just focus and just be quiet and chill and play.
[10:08.51]I can't like, I can't have an audience with a game like that.
[10:12.59]I felt the same way about Bloodborne.
[10:13.94]I played the absolute shit out of Bloodborne.
[10:17.04]None of it was on a stream.
[10:18.63]I just...
[10:19.67]It's too much pressure.
[10:21.77]That's really what it is, and I crack under pressure.
[10:24.05]I really do.
[10:24.96]Well, I crack under certain pressure.
[10:28.73]Like, you get me in a room with a thousand people and I gotta do, like, a presentation?
[10:31.96]Oh.
[10:32.53]Bang.
[10:32.81]I'll knock that out of the fucking park.
[10:34.73]But you like tell me I have to kill like this really hard boss in front of like even 10 people.
[10:40.03]And I'll be like, yeah, hold on a second, my hands are shaking.
[10:46.54]Not good in that regard.
[10:49.08]We don't want you to do well.
[10:51.05]Stop playing Zen.
[10:51.79]I'm testing you.
[10:55.44]Ah, the French champagne.
[10:59.10]has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[11:04.84]Who is that?
[11:05.42]Who just rubbed?
[11:06.41]Tazor, five months.
[11:07.59]Thanks for the five months.
[11:08.58]Welcome back.
[11:11.17]This guy does not want me to play Zenyatta.
[11:13.68]We just won the last game when I was playing Zenyatta.
[11:16.57]Come on.
[11:17.73]Is he that bad?
[11:19.41]Is it like a sin to play him right now?
[11:38.72]Yeah, that feels a lot better.
[11:48.19]Still alive, still alive.
[12:03.90]Anybody coming around the corner?
[12:04.97]Shit, I'm gonna lose line of sight.
[12:19.04]Yeah, if you don't keep... Those of you that are just joining and you don't know what we're talking about.
[12:23.84]Zenyatta got changed.
[12:25.54]So, is Orba Discord and Orba Harmony now...
[12:27.91]come back to you in three seconds if you're not in line of sight of the person.
[12:33.00]Pretty major change.
[12:34.85]I'd say it's not a very good change, but I'm a biased Zenayata player.
[12:39.89]And everybody's dead.
[12:41.22]So I'm just going to sit over here for a second.
[12:49.26]Greetings.
[12:55.74]I have an ult but...
[12:59.69]I'm just gonna do it I don't want us all to die right here
[13:08.94]Shit, same guy up top every time.
[13:17.97]Is the line of sight your FOV or like a D.Va ult line of sight?
[13:20.98]It's literally like line of sight.
[13:23.19]Like if you can see them...
[13:24.61]If you can physically see them on your screen and they're not behind a wall, like this type of line of sight, like this guy right here, like I can't.
[13:31.97]This is he would it would come back to me.
[13:34.45]So literally, if I can see the person on my screen, that's not behind a wall.
[13:40.87]Oh, jeez.
[13:43.30]Oh, jeez.
[13:44.64]We're in a load of trouble here.
[13:46.00]I don't want to pop my head off, but I kind of have to.
[13:52.00]No, I don't.
[13:55.07]Shit.
[13:55.78]Alright, it's time to change.
[13:56.60]I'm gonna have to go to something else here.
[13:58.13]We're getting kind of rolled.
[14:10.90]Did I just spawn with one ammo gun?
[14:17.38]I think I did.
[14:18.23]I'm pretty sure I just spawned with one shot.
[14:20.50]Unless I, like, spawn shot.
[14:22.54]I don't think I did.
[14:30.61]Gotcha!
[14:37.02]There's an FOV slider in the game, but it's not...
[14:40.25]You can't go in and do a configuration tool and mess with it.
[14:49.70]Whoa, you came out of nowhere.
[14:55.17]No!
[14:55.85]No, my melee button!
[14:56.63]I thought they fixed this!
[14:58.44]I thought they fixed it.
[14:59.93]I thought that was in the patch notes.
[15:01.16]They said they fixed it.
[15:04.36]No!
[15:04.97]No, I don't want to do this.
[15:06.84]I hope I don't have to do this again.
[15:09.97]One of the things specifically in the patch notes said that they fixed the bug about where key bindings didn't get...
[15:23.28]Holy shit, we're just dead.
[15:27.62]We're just dead.
[15:37.17]I've warned you.
[15:38.99]I know, but I doubt that the... Pachnos said... Pachnos told me that it was going to be fixed.
[15:46.79]Play of the year.
[15:55.92]Yeah, it was kind of for nothing.
[15:57.68]Unfortunately.
[16:03.48]You can change FOV, yeah.
[16:04.36]There's a slider.
[16:10.87]I think the FOV should be something like 90 at the highest setting.
[16:28.70]They also did something to experience too.
[16:30.45]If you play consecutive games, I guess.
[16:33.36]Hold on, I want to move my microphone.
[16:35.57]I'm going to mute for a second.
[16:36.43]I want to get it closer to my mouth.
[16:53.54]I want to put it in a better spot.
[16:56.56]Star was here and we kind of moved it around while he was here.
[17:07.84]Yeah, I'm not sure Blizzard has had an official number for what the actual FOV is at the highest setting.
[17:14.10]Let's see.
[17:14.51]Video.
[17:16.64]Field of view, 103.
[17:19.43]So it's either 80 or 103, and I have it at a 103.
[17:31.80]I feel like the Zenyatta, yeah.
[17:36.10]I do too.
[17:36.64]I feel like changing Zenyatta.
[17:38.73]I don't think he really needed it.
[17:40.46]If anything, I think I would have been more okay with them nerfing his Discord orb.
[17:45.77]Because it kind of is one of the best moves in the game.
[17:49.40]If you're going to change something, I would change that.
[18:03.14]Why 103?
[18:03.92]Why so specific?
[18:05.69]I don't know.
[18:07.79]That's a question for a Blizzard developer.
[18:15.32]though.
[18:22.88]They did nerf Discord.
[18:23.93]Well, they nerfed Discord, but they nerfed War of Harmony as well, which I don't think you needed to do both.
[18:39.65]May the best video Game Boy win.
[18:44.20]Yeah, may the best video Game Boy win.
[18:52.72]Century?
[18:54.71]Well, it's dead, whatever it was.
[19:02.49]Oh, he knocked me back.
[19:10.92]Damn it.
[19:14.18]I need to, like, sneak somebody.
[19:19.58]Well, I got her, but I killed her.
[19:21.25]I think we're gonna get it!
[19:25.47]Hooray!
[19:27.95]Pharah?
[19:28.73]Is that our Pharah?
[19:33.69]Whoa, what the hell?
[19:41.60]He's in type 2 speed.
[19:43.80]That was so awkward.
[19:54.24]Yeah, the patch notes are on Reddit right now if you go to the Overwatch Reddit.
[20:01.86]Oh, my 100%.
[20:04.64]accuracy
[20:14.22]Who's on it?
[20:15.94]Oh, you.
[20:21.19]No, she's not dead?
[20:22.02]I thought someone was gonna get you.
[20:22.98]Oh, you know what?
[20:24.83]Just shit in my pants.
[20:30.30]He's still alive.
[20:30.95]The Lúcio didn't die.
[20:32.20]That Lúcio's still alive after that.
[20:36.06]He ate like 200 bullets and he's still alive.
[20:40.96]Give me a fucking break.
[20:51.48]I think there are new skins too.
[20:52.39]I'll look at them after this game.
[20:54.98]Ugh.
[20:59.20]Oh my lord.
[21:05.13]Well, I'm just gonna go this way.
[21:06.26]Forget all of you.
[21:09.70]I think we're in trouble here.
[21:17.91]Everybody stay alive.
[21:22.43]Oh, there's too many people there.
[21:23.68]Drink the juice.
[21:27.21]I need to take a nappy.
[21:28.33]I just woke up like two or three hours ago.
[21:33.01]I'm awake.
[21:34.74]I'm able.
[21:39.41]99% they're going to get it.
[21:55.02]I don't want to steal that health back.
[21:56.90]It'll be very greedy of me.
[21:58.29]And I have a heal.
[22:02.39]No, that's no good.
[22:03.42]That's no good.
[22:05.39]I want to pull that Pharaoh.
[22:10.09]So bad.
[22:11.20]Well, I thought you were an enemy for a second.
[22:17.43]I don't really have a good point of entry here.
[22:18.96]I might change to Reinhardt or something.
[22:28.21]Fell off, it's okay.
[22:30.94]But then there comes the cavalry.
[22:34.29]I grab one guy and the whole team shows up.
[22:47.09]Somebody blew the horn.
[22:50.30]I have an ult, so I'll try this ult and then potentially change.
[22:55.48]Where's it gonna go?
[23:03.92]Sorry, I hit a bunch of dudes.
[23:07.93]Yeah, we need some substantial damage soak here.
[23:13.28]Actually, I'm Winston.
[23:14.17]That's probably a better idea, so I can just jump in it.
[23:16.47]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:18.51]I'm doing Reinhardt.
[23:25.89]I'm going through the kitchen.
[23:31.20]Get in!
[23:34.24]Get in!
[23:35.14]Get behind me!
[23:39.76]We're gonna lose the game
[23:53.19]I think we lost.
[23:54.74]Nah, it's over.
[24:00.68]Oh no!
[24:07.60]PeeWee, is that you?
[24:09.43]Yeah, it kinda was PeeWee.
[24:11.99]Well, this time I'm gonna just be Reinhardt from the get-go.
[24:19.45]That's pretty decent peewee.
[24:23.29]System check initiated.
[24:25.32]Green across the board.
[24:28.04]I'm not a very good Reinhardt though, that's the problem.
[24:33.74]I never know when to do my certain moves.
[24:38.35]But somebody's gotta do it, right?
[24:40.91]Looks like it's gonna have to be me.
[24:47.82]It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.
[24:53.40]Just stuff in there.
[24:55.20]Get in.
[24:56.01]Just get in here.
[24:57.09]What happened?
[25:03.61]Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.
[25:12.30]Oh, there's a monkey behind me.
[25:13.19]He's shocking me.
[25:16.52]Shit.
[25:18.43]Yeah.
[25:32.23]We were on that for a long time, too.
[25:34.50]I'm not sure how we lost it.
[25:41.12]I have the power.
[25:42.83]Chicken Fingers, how the hell are you, dude?
[25:45.12]I haven't seen your face in a long time.
[25:48.65]How are you?
[25:54.15]I just go right down the middle.
[25:55.90]I'm just gonna get a strike here.
[25:56.99]I'm just gonna ball right down the middle.
[25:59.46]Got it.
[26:01.35]I got the last pin.
[26:02.21]I picked up the spear.
[26:07.77]How many are here?
[26:08.38]How many are here?
[26:10.13]How many are here?
[26:11.57]Eat shit!
[26:21.34]I thought I could have got it off.
[26:28.68]Can you stun turrets?
[26:29.86]I don't think so.
[26:32.07]I kind of was just being a dingus.
[26:37.76]Stand behind my shield!
[26:38.84]Get behind the shield!
[26:39.91]Get behind me!
[26:44.10]I just double stunned that guy.
[26:49.70]Come on, give me the triple!
[26:53.16]I'll take a triple kill.
[26:57.73]You're gonna be NYPD?
[26:59.07]Damn.
[27:01.69]Hey, you know, I got a parking ticket like two years ago.
[27:04.30]I think I might need to get it cleared up.
[27:06.77]No, that's awesome, dude.
[27:07.45]Good for you.
[27:24.45]Where are you going?
[27:25.80]We're going around the back.
[27:27.75]Why did I not get that?
[27:30.32]Why didn't I get that?
[27:32.25]I absolutely should have just gotten that.
[27:34.68]What the hell was that?
[27:35.86]Overstrike!
[27:40.34]I got like one pin.
[27:41.39]It's okay.
[27:57.29]No!
[27:58.31]No!
[27:59.82]No!
[28:00.81]Don't do it!
[28:02.19]Fuck.
[28:03.80]There's too much going on.
[28:07.19]Hey, Boo.
[28:09.03]Oh, hi, Boo.
[28:10.33]How are ya?
[28:17.12]Watch out for that door!
[28:21.17]I have an ult.
[28:25.66]We just gotta get in there.
[28:28.24]Just get me in there, coach.
[28:30.14]Get me in there.
[28:30.56]Get me off the sidelines.
[28:31.99]Here we go.
[28:33.29]This is the one.
[28:36.86]That's not the one we're going to lose.
[28:42.45]Oh well.
[28:53.75]I want to look at skins because I didn't really look at them.
[28:55.91]What did I do?
[28:56.59]I didn't do anything.
[28:58.45]What the hell did I do here?
[29:05.21]No.
[29:08.31]I guess I got those boys.
[29:17.56]What the fuck happened to the kills?
[29:19.23]I don't know.
[29:30.10]Play the weekly brawl.
[29:31.61]I will.
[29:32.65]I just want to get a couple of games in.
[29:33.73]I want to warm up a little bit before I do the psycho mode.
[29:38.31]But I want to look at skins.
[29:39.07]That's what I want to do.
[29:44.33]Because I want to take a look.
[29:48.32]Did Bastion get any new ones?
[29:51.01]This is from a couple patches ago, but still really awesome.
[29:56.61]He's like the Geppetto.
[30:00.13]Pinocchio bot.
[30:02.00]Who got actual skins?
[30:03.13]Junkrat did.
[30:07.88]The Joker.
[30:09.77]Okay that's pretty awesome.
[30:13.97]Yeah that's really awesome.
[30:17.10]What about other highlight videos?
[30:20.90]Do they add any of those?
[30:28.39]Oh my god.
[30:30.34]Yeah.
[30:31.93]I so badly want the Dick Tracy skin.
[30:35.59]This is just Dick Tracy.
[30:38.08]That's unbelievable.
[30:39.01]I want this so bad.
[30:45.84]Oh, come on.
[30:49.23]How do I get it?
[30:50.19]How do I unlock?
[30:51.90]How do I click the button?
[30:53.35]What's like the cheat code I have to press?
[31:03.77]Do you guys even know Dick Tracy?
[31:06.32]It was an old, an old cool thing.
[31:09.45]Reaper got one.
[31:12.92]He got Birdman.
[31:20.41]There's the Origins Edition pre-order skin.
[31:35.03]I know there's a pirate Torbjörn.
[31:40.37]What a SpongeBob character.
[31:42.62]This is so stupid.
[31:45.34]Nice Saturday morning cartoon character.
[31:51.85]Does his turret look different too?
[31:53.71]Does it have the cannons?
[31:56.20]That would be awesome if it was a different turret too.
[32:05.33]What Genji?
[32:05.88]Genji still needs one.
[32:08.95]All the Genji skins are terrible, I think, in my opinion.
[32:11.48]They're just, I mean...
[32:14.58]Honestly, I can't tell the difference between this one and this one.
[32:20.74]The only difference to me is I guess it's slightly different.
[32:24.09]Somebody took the contrast or something and added a little brown.
[32:28.17]I need to get Genji a cool skin.
[32:30.80]Because these are all... Any other ones that I haven't seen?
[32:43.54]Anything new for Zenyatta?
[32:46.23]No, these have been here for a little while.
[32:52.70]I don't have a trace or anything now.
[32:59.45]No.
[33:01.64]No.
[33:08.43]He's the stunt rider.
[33:10.70]So it's just this one with a helmet.
[33:14.29]I don't know.
[33:14.63]Do I like Elvis better or do I like Elvis with a helmet?
[33:18.79]I kind of want the Elvis skin.
[33:24.84]At least you got one.
[33:25.38]Let's take a look.
[33:30.13]The hip hopper.
[33:31.96]Gold frog man.
[33:35.28]Okay, that's awesome.
[33:37.53]That is so just not even Lúcio.
[33:40.02]That's the funniest part.
[33:43.12]I guess I kind of throw out the window.
[33:45.26]Characters like silhouettes need to be the same because like this is a different character.
[33:50.26]This is like Frogmundio, the new Overwatch character.
[33:56.98]It's like so different, but that's awesome regardless.
[34:04.12]Alright, let's go back to playing.
[34:06.33]Highlights.
[34:08.91]Oh, I forgot about this.
[34:09.97]This is fucking awesome.
[34:10.90]I forgot.
[34:11.36]This is...
[34:13.03]So it saves your own personal plays of the game, even if you didn't get to play the game.
[34:18.51]Was watching.
[34:21.68]I guess this is one of the plays of the game.
[34:23.49]Like, it just keeps the footage.
[34:26.65]Ah, the French champagne.
[34:30.32]Always been celebrated for its excellence the third man third man.
[34:34.97]Thanks a lot for the resub
[34:37.93]Okay, this is awesome.
[34:38.80]This is cool.
[34:39.46]Because after every session, you can kind of go back and see what you did.
[34:41.69]That was really good.
[34:45.32]Overwatch.
[34:46.58]Yeah, that is the game I'm playing.
[34:51.96]I think it does up to five.
[34:57.10]Yeah, because these both were plays of the game, so we already saw them.
[35:00.90]But that's really awesome.
[35:01.79]This is a really, really cool feature that I'm glad they're doing because...
[35:06.01]Let's say you play for like three, four, five plus hours.
[35:10.15]At the end of your session, you can kind of go back and just watch them through and just like kind of relive the moments you had and remember them
[35:16.00]So that's like an A plus addition.
[35:18.26]That's a huge plus for me.
[35:21.56]But, uh...
[35:22.42]Did Zenyatta's Orb of Harmony need to get changed as bad as it did?
[35:28.40]I don't...
[35:30.89]What is this?
[35:31.45]Elos?
[35:33.72]Have I been here before?
[35:34.85]No, yeah, I did one.
[35:35.53]I played on this one time.
[35:37.20]This is also a new-ish map.
[35:44.12]Well, it's only for the last five games.
[35:45.86]I thought it was like it's stored up to five things.
[35:51.88]Let's say that's pretty cool.
[35:55.51]It's still awesome.
[36:01.21]Let's dispense a little bit of justice.
[36:05.04]Oh, D.Va got new skins too?
[36:07.14]I saw the D.Va ones.
[36:08.29]There's one Bumblebee D.Va, right?
[36:15.86]Do I ever look at chat?
[36:16.78]All the time.
[36:17.33]All the time.
[36:22.21]Too bad I'm not going to be playing on here.
[36:32.41]Oh, we're just going to Gibraltar.
[36:40.90]Yeah, I'm assuming eventually with that highlights feature, they'll let you save them locally.
[36:47.23]And maybe you can even...
[36:49.12]edit them now how cool would this be right like there's just a little there's just a little notion of what could be cool
[36:56.09]imagine you could save locally all those highlights that you have or whatever ones you want to keep and then there's like an in-game like video editor
[37:05.69]you know in engine kind of like what rockstar did with uh GTA
[37:12.04]I've always wished that games would have stuff like that.
[37:14.23]So you can kind of go into plays that you did and move the camera around and make kind of like edits.
[37:20.80]Like, imagine if, like, I'm playing through this game right now.
[37:22.66]Like, even just for, like, making, like, commentary videos.
[37:24.91]I don't really do them that much anymore, but, like, for other people that do.
[37:28.44]Thank you, Orson.
[37:29.94]Heretic.
[37:32.01]Anchorite.
[37:33.48]Two months.
[37:34.76]Two months in a row.
[37:35.31]Thanks a lot, dude.
[37:36.78]But what I'm saying is, if you could save those and go in and add them...
[37:46.92]You guys know what I'm saying, but chicken fingers welcome.
[37:49.05]Thanks, dude.
[37:53.25]Welcome to the Chalk Shockers.
[37:56.99]Ricci N.A.
[38:01.37]Ricci N.A., thanks a lot for the sub.
[38:04.92]Welcome to the piss drinkers.
[38:08.77]Whoa, hey.
[38:09.91]Not nice.
[38:11.86]No, please don't do it!
[38:14.61]You didn't do it.
[38:15.31]I got you.
[38:16.93]I gotta get the health.
[38:21.97]But yeah, welcome both you guys and welcome back the new resub.
[38:31.05]Asshole.
[38:35.21]He's really not dead.
[38:38.98]He's really not dead!
[38:40.49]Thank goodness.
[38:44.50]Oh well.
[38:45.73]Alright, so let me like reiterate the point I was making there.
[38:48.42]So...
[38:50.03]If there was a feature like GTA where you could record a whole round
[38:54.30]And then go in and do edits to it.
[38:56.01]So let's say I'm like walking out right now.
[38:57.41]Like you could... Oh, he's teleported, but...
[38:59.36]I could change the camera, do cuts in the game, like in the footage, and then save it out as like an MP4.
[39:06.94]That's something I wish a game would do.
[39:08.37]No game has done that really yet.
[39:09.72]Like an FPS.
[39:11.36]Call of Duty allows that type of shit, but does it allow you to go in and edit the camera?
[39:25.60]Shit.
[39:26.64]Taylor Swift just killed me.
[39:31.98]Edit the video to make it look like you want.
[39:33.65]Yeah, like, Team Fortress 2, right?
[39:36.00]Like, you can go in and, like, you're saving demos and go in and change the camera.
[39:40.30]But the problem with TF2 is it has to be enabled on the server you're playing on.
[39:46.34]I wish there was just an in-engine, locally recording thing, so you don't have to...
[39:51.24]I don't know, I guess that would take a lot of, like, CPU, because it...
[39:54.01]Essentially, you'd have to record everybody's game.
[39:57.82]But, I don't know, I've always wanted something like that.
[39:59.55]To be able to in-engine edit things.
[40:04.87]That didn't have like very many limitations, but you know.
[40:09.05]Oh, here comes an explosion.
[40:18.74]He flew away.
[40:20.43]Shit bastard.
[40:21.97]Are you kidding me?
[40:27.97]I don't know why I was waiting for the Bastion.
[40:29.64]I figured the Bastion was going to appear somewhere.
[40:38.52]Yeah.
[40:48.91]Grab that AutoMod.
[40:50.23]What grab that AutoMod is this?
[40:56.10]How does resubbing work?
[40:57.07]Do I do it manually?
[40:57.92]I think as long as you don't cancel it, it should stay there.
[41:09.32]He got me.
[41:11.22]He got me with a jam.
[41:14.50]Helix Noir.
[41:16.99]Welcome.
[41:18.29]Welcome to the trash, man.
[41:24.30]I think I'm gonna change to Junkrat.
[41:25.87]I feel like it's a Junkrat kind of a morning.
[41:27.74]Afternoon.
[41:44.38]Come over here.
[41:45.58]I know you want to jump over that.
[42:01.51]Damn it.
[42:03.64]No, no.
[42:04.02]I'm going to be counter Pharah.
[42:06.66]This Pharah is just always, always killing me.
[42:14.67]Always.
[42:18.71]See, just Jerma re-chat.
[42:20.32]I was just reading chat and was walking into a wall.
[42:41.35]I've never done that before.
[42:43.05]Where's my punch another ferret in the face while flying achievement?
[43:03.90]Thanks for the assist.
[43:16.91]Ow.
[43:23.53]Yeah, heal!
[43:36.80]Holy shit, I instantly died.
[43:42.09]Can I pronounce Zenayatta for you?
[43:43.55]Yeah, it's Zenayatta.
[43:47.11]Holy fuck, I insta-died.
[43:50.65]That guy didn't have a machine gun, he had missiles.
[43:59.82]I was waiting for him when I got him, but I died.
[44:09.10]Anybody else on it?
[44:09.93]Make sure there's nobody else here.
[44:10.79]Yeah, there are people on it.
[44:11.76]I'm not leaving.
[44:14.86]D.Va's still over here.
[44:22.86]Oh, I need health.
[44:41.40]I just didn't want to get killed there.
[44:44.90]Ah!
[44:46.45]Fuck you, Bastion!
[44:49.44]Ugh!
[44:53.69]Oh my god.
[44:54.63]I like how it shows the meters now.
[45:11.62]No.
[45:23.29]If I didn't miss that, I could've knocked her off.
[45:25.15]Just didn't even know she was there.
[45:36.09]Oh, we're so gonna lose here.
[45:42.75]Holy shit, are you kidding me?
[45:53.86]At the very least.
[46:00.41]What just happened?
[46:03.67]Did we all like die like four times?
[46:05.74]Yeah, this guy's Genji is like on point.
[46:08.41]He's really good at this game.
[46:10.38]He's really good at this video game.
[46:15.02]He's gonna heal the same guy twice.
[46:20.69]That guy's killed like five people.
[46:36.59]He's playing Genji for short.
[46:37.91]Is Genji like strong right now?
[46:41.37]I haven't been playing Overwatch this last week.
[46:43.23]I've been sort of busy with things.
[46:46.95]Is Genji supposed to be, like, really good?
[46:48.94]I know he's hard to play.
[46:50.97]every time I see a genji that's just destroying people ow my knuckle just got knocked into my desk
[46:57.08]But whenever I see a Genji just crushing it, I'm always like, yeah, Genji, fucking, yeah, he's probably broke, you know.
[47:03.54]Then I try to play Genji, and I just can't.
[47:05.17]I'm just bad at it.
[47:06.16]I can't do anything.
[47:15.07]I'm gonna go back to... Back to a Roadhog.
[47:28.99]Yeah it just knocked my knuckle.
[47:31.04]It was an accident.
[47:38.98]Where's my dog?
[47:40.42]Oh, he's underneath the blankets over here.
[47:42.17]He's sleeping over there.
[47:45.04]Are you underneath the blankies, dog?
[47:50.57]New Tavern Brawl.
[47:51.16]Yeah, I'll try the new Tavern Brawl after this.
[47:53.05]See how it goes.
[47:56.97]I'm gonna get some kills here though.
[47:58.78]I need to get my own personal highlights.
[48:04.10]Why don't I yodel anymore?
[48:05.49]Did I ever yodel to begin with?
[48:10.03]I don't think I even can yodel.
[48:11.77]In fact, I'm not going to do it because I'm embarrassed in potential of how embarrassing.
[48:17.23]I'm embarrassed at how potentially embarrassing that's going to embarrass me.
[48:20.33]So, no.
[48:21.45]I'm not even going to try.
[48:28.91]Hearthstone?
[48:30.64]Who's talking about Hearthstone in here guys?
[48:32.83]We don't talk about Hearthstone.
[48:35.12]That's not the game that's currently on the screen.
[48:36.76]We're playing Overwatch.
[48:45.23]I don't want to see any more Hearthstone chatter in this chat.
[48:54.54]I want to just get out there and grab that Hanzo.
[48:57.04]Just suck him into my stomach.
[48:59.97]You know, I'm going the other way.
[49:00.81]I'm going to suck that guy.
[49:07.50]Where is he?
[49:14.78]Where is he?
[49:15.10]I'm gonna suck him.
[49:15.86]Come on.
[49:16.46]Come on!
[49:20.90]I almost perfectly got that guy sucked.
[49:38.71]Come on.
[49:47.41]It was just so perfect of him to come right around the corner right there.
[50:03.88]Shit.
[50:07.81]Who the fuck is bot?
[50:13.05]He's here?
[50:14.90]They were all just standing on those stairs, aren't they?
[50:18.76]No, I can't play this right now.
[50:21.13]Too many players that are very good at this game on the other team.
[50:23.48]I have to play something else.
[50:26.19]I'm just a giant target right now to everybody.
[50:31.82]Yo, healer, are you there?
[50:35.29]We're getting AFK?
[50:36.61]What's going on?
[50:39.08]Let me play Winston.
[50:46.81]Like gotta jump on people right now
[51:04.85]Alright, let's get up there.
[51:13.69]Get on the cart.
[51:20.82]Oh, there's a person on the right?
[51:22.19]Yeah, it's a Junkrat.
[51:22.89]Whoa, they got a Teleporter right here.
[51:32.53]They just used that teleporter like six times.
[51:34.47]Look at this.
[51:36.54]They used like 65% of every charge that teleporter had.
[51:43.82]And as you can tell, I'm a little...
[51:45.81]This guy's got the Dick Tracy skin.
[51:48.76]Ugh.
[51:49.56]I so badly wish I was you.
[52:09.20]Come here, come here.
[52:16.95]I'm up here now.
[52:19.41]Come on, I'll be just like an obnoxious distraction.
[52:25.43]I'm so dead.
[52:34.04]Ah, the French champagne.
[52:38.44]Has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[52:41.63]Cheese Fist.
[52:42.95]Cheese Fist is back with three months.
[52:45.56]Three months in a row.
[52:48.08]That is $15.
[52:49.63]That you gave me.
[52:53.01]So, thank you.
[52:54.71]Welcome to the $15 jock-shocking, shock-shocking, electrocutor shock-shockers.
[53:00.57]See how much I just did?
[53:01.46]Look at all the dispersion I just did.
[53:08.53]Hey, hey.
[53:10.26]Hey, who's doing that?
[53:12.12]Hey, hey.
[53:13.39]Oops, got a bubble on the cart.
[53:16.41]Okay, bye.
[53:21.03]I got it.
[53:26.40]Okay, I just felt like there was nine people on this team.
[53:29.01]I saw like so many silhouettes.
[53:30.12]I thought there was like 50 people.
[53:32.46]Where's the team?
[53:33.49]Are we all up top?
[53:34.60]Alright, let's just try to get moving.
[53:43.83]It's so hard to move up.
[53:45.26]I could have to jump over there.
[53:46.45]I'm gonna have to just... Ah, I can't.
[53:49.77]It's not gonna happen.
[54:04.72]Somebody, somebody, somebody get around him.
[54:12.09]I just juked him.
[54:13.70]Just call me a running back.
[54:15.65]That guy's not getting a touch.
[54:16.73]Did he really just do that?
[54:18.60]Is this happening right now?
[54:20.66]My lord.
[54:23.69]God dammit.
[54:27.56]I have such little HP.
[54:34.17]One arrow and I'm dead.
[54:40.51]Huh?
[54:44.70]Oh, come on, really?
[54:46.41]Really?
[54:54.15]Really?
[54:57.18]Really?
[54:57.72]I'm gonna have to go nuts on the point.
[55:10.15]Well, not much time left.
[55:12.51]And they just dropped the beat.
[55:28.95]Get on it!
[55:32.16]Just push it.
[55:32.81]We don't need to do anything else.
[55:33.73]Just get on it.
[55:37.54]Let's get it.
[55:38.14]Once it's capped, I'm jumping upstairs.
[55:42.01]Got a sub.
[55:44.62]Mink fur.
[55:47.74]Welcome to planet Earth.
[55:49.89]Thanks for something.
[55:50.74]Welcome.
[55:52.18]Much appreciated!
[56:03.78]Watch out.
[56:04.50]Where's the trash can?
[56:05.30]I hear it.
[56:06.61]Where was it?
[56:07.09]Where was it?
[56:07.51]Where was it?
[56:07.93]I don't even see it.
[56:11.52]Where was it?
[56:11.92]Right here?
[56:14.22]Oh my lord.
[56:20.30]I'll get that, don't worry.
[56:26.98]Okay, mission accomplished.
[56:28.24]It's all about just being on the cart.
[56:34.55]Gotta stay back on it.
[56:42.27]He just missed.
[56:43.20]Thank god I just juked it.
[56:49.95]I'm just being so annoying to this guy, but I can't kill him.
[56:53.93]He's gonna, like, get another charge.
[56:59.28]What's that?
[56:59.74]Up and down?
[57:00.94]Where am I?
[57:01.90]Okay.
[57:02.25]No, where am I?
[57:03.13]Alright.
[57:08.76]Oh, what?
[57:14.77]Thank the kind and dedicated mods that clear spam.
[57:21.46]You watching a commercial for me?
[57:24.62]For a second, I just misread that, that you're watching a commercial that I'm in.
[57:27.46]I was like, I didn't do any commercials.
[57:30.20]But, yeah.
[57:32.64]God, Winston sucks.
[57:33.62]Yeah, boo, Winston does suck so bad at killing really anyone.
[57:36.59]Except if they have little health.
[57:50.59]Get away from me.
[57:52.94]No!
[57:53.48]Nobody was on it?
[57:55.61]Oh, where were the people?
[57:56.59]Where were the people?
[57:57.98]Where's peoples?
[58:03.32]I mean, that was really cool and all, but, I mean, like, various peoples.
[58:13.07]I need to be in a commercial?
[58:15.86]What would the commercial even be?
[58:31.77]I do not have the BS skin as much as I wish I did.
[58:44.61]A lot of objective time.
[58:45.86]9% weapon accuracy, what?
[58:53.71]Did I shoot the gun one time into a wall?
[58:56.63]I don't understand that.
[59:11.16]Hmm.
[59:13.79]Hmm.
[59:14.44]Hmm.
[59:19.29]I don't want to play.
[59:23.71]Let's play 76.
[59:24.49]76.
[59:28.89]Voice act in Overwatch?
[59:32.19]I mean, that's like a pipe dream, but it'd be cool.
[59:43.74]To a Torbjörn voice?
[59:45.99]Like a voice pack?
[59:51.87]You get to be in the new map though.
[59:52.86]That's good.
[60:11.01]Yeah, I was gonna go to Tavern Brawl, but this is the new map.
[60:15.35]Sometimes you have to play on Badwater Basin a couple times, you know?
[60:18.85]Sometimes you have to play on Badwater Basin for six straight hours every day.
[60:24.66]Pretty much what I used to do back in like 2011.
[60:35.87]This guy's kind of a beer, too.
[60:38.22]Ray should have cleaned up that gang a long time ago.
[60:40.79]Yeah.
[60:46.16]Sometimes it's tough, but you know.
[60:49.44]I'm Commander Morrison, but I'm Soldier: 76.
[60:51.81]I'm a different person now, don't you know?
[60:55.86]Gotta put a heel on the point.
[60:57.59]Get over here and heel up.
[61:02.50]I like the little broken down carts here you can go through.
[61:07.44]He's not even gonna know.
[61:08.06]I'm gonna get right behind this guy.
[61:11.58]He's not gonna even know.
[61:14.65]I would have ice cream scoped him, but I didn't.
[61:26.19]Dammit!
[61:31.98]I'm not sure if I'm feeling 76.
[61:39.18]This old dog's learned a few tricks.
[61:45.25]Teaches the pancake recipe?
[61:48.90]I can't.
[61:51.80]I just, seriously, just, no.
[61:53.99]That's when you know it's time to play a different character.
[61:57.02]Because I don't know what happened to me.
[61:59.31]I saw a guy that was covered in jello, and then I died.
[62:03.12]What killed me?
[62:03.62]Did he actually kill me?
[62:07.80]Un- unbelievable.
[62:20.31]Glad to see this hallway spam I can do here.
[62:26.97]Nice shoot.
[62:29.15]Farah, you piece of crap.
[62:43.34]Damn.
[62:44.58]Damn, they're just everywhere.
[62:52.40]Why have I not done the Overwatch videos lately?
[62:55.04]I just haven't really had a good idea to talk about something.
[62:59.46]Recently I have.
[63:01.18]So there might be one in the next week.
[63:04.08]But I haven't really had a lot to talk about.
[63:07.29]But I kind of do.
[63:08.70]Kind of.
[63:14.80]Holy shit.
[63:18.70]Alright, this is... We can't even all... We gotta all get away from here.
[63:28.20]Shit stay behind me Hopefully I saved somebody's life
[63:40.82]I could ult right now.
[63:49.69]None of those are headshots.
[63:51.11]Did it again!
[63:51.58]Blizzard!
[63:52.32]Blizzard!
[63:53.90]It wasn't entertainment.
[63:55.76]None of those are in the head.
[63:57.03]At least one of those had to be in the head.
[63:59.70]Like, really?
[64:03.50]Out of all the four shots I shot there, none of those were in his head.
[64:14.87]No, at least two of those were directly into his fucking face.
[64:43.73]Blizzard, fix your Blizzard.
[64:55.30]When you're that close, there's an offset.
[64:58.86]I had the same problem with Roadhog, too.
[65:00.69]We shoot Roadhog directly in his forehead and it just would be a white marker.
[65:10.76]No, fuck that.
[65:17.55]Come on, I didn't get anybody in that.
[65:31.00]Fucking hell.
[65:36.11]Alright, I gotta...
[65:37.05]I'm playing... No.
[65:40.50]Thanks for watching!
[65:53.83]Remember, that was bad ultimate move usage.
[65:57.69]When you're getting fucking steamrolled, it's kinda hard to even know what the fuck to do in the first place.
[66:02.72]I've got you in my sights.
[66:07.09]I swear that Zarya is only trying to kill you.
[66:10.37]I don't know.
[66:11.21]I don't know.
[66:12.28]I feel like I was trying to kill the Zarya more often than not.
[66:47.42]Has it always been that you freeze people for like 0.00001 seconds?
[66:55.83]Jeremiah, are you pro-Batman or pro-Superman?
[66:58.43]Neither.
[66:59.80]I'm a pro-Riddler.
[67:07.91]Star?
[67:08.51]What?
[67:10.62]Okay.
[67:12.69]Hi, Star.
[67:28.70]for a Riddler.
[67:42.43]Who's he playing?
[67:47.50]Tracer?
[67:51.85]I feel like I had a pretty good Winston game.
[67:54.32]I feel like that's... You know, every time I stream, there's like one character that I can play.
[67:59.11]And the rest of them, I just get rolled every time.
[68:01.84]Sometimes it's like McCree, sometimes it's Roadhog, sometimes it's Winston
[68:11.11]Get away from me.
[68:12.95]Yeah, I wouldn't drink the coffee.
[68:15.86]Always tasted like boiled dirt.
[68:17.97]I've got the right stuff.
[68:20.00]I've got the right stuff baby.
[68:28.37]He's kind of a biya too, isn't he?
[68:30.94]I calculate our survival at 0.525%.
[68:34.14]Everybody's just a biya in this game.
[68:39.86]Hello?
[68:49.38]Holy shit.
[68:55.67]Okay.
[68:58.63]That cart is very far away from the... Actually, I didn't really even realize that.
[69:02.06]How far away the cart is from the front door.
[69:06.73]Further experimentation required.
[69:23.16]Was he really back to full health?
[69:28.37]I guess he was.
[69:32.97]Let's go!
[69:39.68]That's how you get tinnitus.
[69:42.72]Where's the enemy team?
[69:43.82]Holy shit, we're just on this...
[69:48.63]I can see all of you.
[69:50.01]There's no threat at the moment.
[69:53.56]Now there is.
[69:57.87]I was hoping for like a jumping shock jock right there.
[70:00.81]That would have been so cool.
[70:01.71]I would have highlighted that one for the play of my own game.
[70:13.53]What's going on?
[70:15.24]Are we on the role team now?
[70:16.53]Is that what happened?
[70:19.41]Did we change roles?
[70:43.91]I got eaten by the dog.
[70:45.01]I didn't know the dog was there.
[70:45.98]This is a cool spawn room.
[70:48.59]Aliens on Earth is shocking proof.
[70:52.43]I like that spawn room.
[70:53.89]I like the green lights
[70:57.44]No one on the other team knows the map.
[70:58.97]You know, that probably has something to do with it.
[71:00.56]Because I don't.
[71:01.64]I don't think anybody does at the moment.
[71:05.42]Oh, I slid off.
[71:07.36]That would have been cool.
[71:15.40]I am an absolute psycho.
[71:22.17]Where is he?
[71:24.97]Oh, that's their spawn door.
[71:26.61]Okay, I didn't even realize what was happening right there.
[71:30.31]Are they talking about knowing the maps?
[71:31.72]I didn't even know that's where they came from.
[71:36.71]No, that isn't...
[71:38.08]They're all just up there?
[71:38.96]That's odd.
[71:40.43]Odd.
[71:40.67]Really odd.
[71:42.78]Really odd things.
[71:51.48]See ya.
[72:03.44]Hold on, T-Swift, let me spring in with it.
[72:12.54]I'm just like getting sucked around the map.
[72:18.16]Oh, high noon.
[72:19.20]No!
[72:19.60]Where am I?
[72:20.74]What's happening?
[72:21.95]I don't even know what direction I'm facing.
[72:26.32]Seriously.
[72:29.07]He was just all the way back there that whole time.
[72:30.86]Did he get three of us?
[72:35.22]Yeah.
[72:37.70]Did the medic lady just talk in Jerma?
[72:45.45]Uh, yeah she did.
[72:49.00]Whoops.
[72:52.57]Didn't mean to do that.
[72:57.83]Three, two, one, hello.
[73:10.62]Good shield.
[73:12.67]Thanks.
[73:14.43]Thank you.
[73:20.20]I might do.
[73:23.97]Tried.
[73:25.23]You see how desperate that just was I heard it, and I just jumped over to her oh shit I didn't do it on her screen
[73:49.52]I've got my ult.
[73:51.60]My ultimate ability is ready.
[74:03.29]I'm just jumping around everywhere.
[74:17.41]Dead.
[74:17.77]Let's keep it moving.
[74:24.90]That's the spawn right there.
[74:25.99]And...
[74:33.21]That guy just got piledrivered.
[74:37.94]That guy seriously just got chokeslammed into a piledriver from that ice ball.
[74:48.12]Dick Tracy got it.
[74:51.62]Let's see what he did.
[74:58.62]Oh, this is when he was behind everybody.
[75:00.15]He got me and Star.
[75:09.84]10 objective kills, damn.
[75:13.76]That's pretty damn nice.
[75:20.86]You think Zenyatta should have line of sight to put orbs on people but not have to retain line of sight to keep them?
[75:25.28]That's how it was before.
[75:27.49]You just had to be able to see a person in line of sight and you could put it on him.
[75:33.30]That's how it worked before.
[75:49.87]I actually want to play the... How do I stop this?
[75:56.37]Cancel.
[75:57.38]I wanted to try the new Super Smash Brothers.
[76:02.08]Because I said I was going to do this like 45 minutes ago and I still haven't done it.
[76:10.56]So it's only Genji and Hanzo and you have reduced cooldowns, but your alts charge slower and you have 400 health.
[76:18.13]Okay Three seconds, okay, that's cool Super Smash Brothers
[76:38.62]Check the D.Va skins.
[76:39.57]I can do that.
[76:40.85]Is there a way to do this?
[76:44.88]Can you do that from in skirmish?
[76:47.63]Star wants to play.
[76:48.60]You want to play this?
[76:49.76]Are you sure you want to play this?
[76:51.27]No, no, no, no, no.
[76:53.17]I want to play this for a little bit.
[76:54.48]We'll play later.
[76:57.10]I haven't like done this yet.
[77:06.72]How do I send a message to you?
[77:35.08]At different borders, you prestige, essentially, in the game now.
[77:43.49]It's not a tavern brawl.
[77:45.49]It kind of is.
[78:01.16]What a psycho, huh?
[78:03.20]Why is he such a psycho?
[78:20.34]Feels bad.
[78:24.16]So I heard that Genji is the character you should be playing in this?
[78:28.09]But you know what?
[78:29.14]I want to play scatter arrow only.
[78:38.48]Steve, yes, you're not playing Genji.
[78:40.07]Big mistake.
[78:40.83]Well, whatever.
[78:41.35]This is Tavern Brawl.
[78:44.43]You're just supposed to have fun.
[78:47.44]I want to climb and say hello to my friends.
[78:59.12]Scatter arrow This is actually scary
[79:10.95]Oh man, they can do that every like two seconds.
[79:14.19]They can reflect every like two seconds.
[79:19.32]Who cares?
[79:23.03]Who cares, guys?
[79:29.87]One arrow.
[79:38.96]Shit!
[79:40.11]I'm too caught up in like spamming the arrows.
[79:43.60]I forgot what I was doing.
[79:55.65]Didn't even know I was there.
[80:01.60]No, shit!
[80:10.44]You're gonna play shuriken?
[80:13.77]Alright, everyone says it gets mad when I say, like, shuriken, shuriken, shuriken.
[80:22.01]Who cares, I'm just gonna get it back.
[80:36.29]Just like hoping to get a kill with this.
[80:40.60]That would be funny.
[80:41.41]I had to hit somebody.
[80:46.04]I don't even know whose arrows are whose.
[81:01.01]Damn it!
[81:06.47]Eh!
[81:06.51]this family arrows Jesus this is fucking crazy
[81:24.10]I must reclaim my honor.
[81:28.67]Entire team.
[81:29.39]Yeah, entire team.
[81:29.95]Not only is Huntsman snipers, but Huntsman snipers that can shoot like a thousand arrows at the same time.
[81:46.93]Damn it.
[81:55.23]Like, all I hear is, like, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee.
[82:04.06]Tch!
[82:14.37]Holy shit!
[82:21.09]I just like accidentally shot that.
[82:23.75]No, don't do it!
[82:36.37]I have no health.
[82:40.43]I just keep hearing the Genji ultimate.
[82:48.86]Where is he?
[82:49.40]Holy shit, he's right next to me.
[82:50.89]Oh, I thought he just jived.
[82:52.32]I thought he just jived off the stage.
[82:58.63]Wasted ult.
[82:59.55]Nice ult.
[83:01.64]I'm just having some fun.
[83:05.36]Look, I have 10 eliminations and 2499 damage.
[83:14.49]None of those arrows hit him.
[83:25.54]Honestly, this is just like he's just diving around every two seconds.
[83:31.02]This is what we call ungelievable.
[83:44.77]I'm so focused on like shooting the arrows at like the ground.
[83:55.23]Oh, come on.
[84:09.96]Oh shit, here comes an ult.
[84:15.16]Give me the health pack.
[84:17.94]Before we all die.
[84:31.39]Come on.
[84:33.32]Really?
[84:33.63]Are you kidding me right now?
[84:46.60]Shit.
[84:48.67]It's so hard to like focus on this shit.
[84:58.98]Why didn't I hit him in the head?
[85:01.55]This is great for... Yeah, this actually is pretty good for just aiming shots at people, I guess.
[85:05.90]If you want to practice against other people doing the same thing as you.
[85:12.40]The dragon consumes you.
[85:30.03]I don't know why I did that.
[85:31.72]Hey, just in case you guys can't see him, here he is.
[85:33.63]They're on the point right now.
[85:38.96]I'm gonna go Genji.
[85:40.97]Just in the last couple minutes here, if we don't lose.
[85:49.30]I don't...
[85:49.91]I never play this character.
[85:50.76]I don't even know...
[85:51.25]Okay, that's the dash.
[86:09.08]I keep forgetting about the actual moves I have.
[86:11.08]They're on like a tiny cooldown.
[86:27.32]There's just guys with swords everywhere.
[86:29.51]This is a sword fight.
[86:35.25]Hey, funny story.
[86:36.42]This is the most playtime I've had on Genji since installing the game, I think.
[86:40.79]I never play Genji.
[86:43.84]Give me a reason to play Genji.
[86:49.46]What the fuck?
[86:59.55]You fucking bug.
[87:01.75]What was that bug?
[87:04.70]He like grabbed onto the edge.
[87:13.49]Everybody held?
[87:24.07]I guess.
[87:24.74]It's hard to even tell where people are.
[87:26.18]I hit that guy in the head.
[87:42.80]Help, help, help, help, help.
[87:50.31]Everyone's throwing light sticks around.
[87:51.94]Everyone just has glow sticks.
[88:09.91]I like hit him in the head.
[88:10.75]Give me the health.
[88:20.38]Give me this health, too.
[88:39.99]I could have had like a five or six player kill there.
[88:43.63]You just had too much fucking reload.
[88:49.51]Come on, I want to do my ult.
[88:51.14]I want to do my ult.
[88:53.44]Come on, somebody step on it.
[88:54.24]Somebody step on it so I can do my ult.
[88:59.57]At least I did my ult.
[89:03.33]If I had hit that last shot, I could have really done some cool things.
[89:18.45]That was like surprisingly stupidly fun.
[89:22.12]Kinda wanna do it again.
[89:34.21]If only I had aimed.
[89:37.07]Aiming would have really helped me there.
[89:47.88]Almost have a box.
[89:51.19]It's almost box time.
[89:59.09]Oh yeah, Star said I wasn't going to have any fun.
[90:03.28]That was fun.
[90:08.44]Please no more.
[90:09.20]This is stupid.
[90:10.34]I want to do one more.
[90:14.76]One more time.
[90:20.08]And then we'll go on to play the actual video game Overwatch.
[90:38.05]Let's take a look.
[90:39.48]Let's look at my Genji highlight.
[90:47.89]Ah, the French champagne.
[90:53.36]It's always been celebrated for its excellence.
[90:56.91]Power to the players.
[90:59.08]Just subscribe.
[91:00.41]Well, he resubbed.
[91:01.93]Thanks.
[91:02.25]Welcome back.
[91:04.78]Power to the players.
[91:06.77]Two months.
[91:11.96]That is 60 days.
[91:19.68]Am I doing the weakly?
[91:20.59]Yes, I am doing the weakly.
[91:21.59]Or trying to, at least.
[91:23.56]I just want to do it one more time.
[91:26.43]Yeah, we can look at the new D.Va skin.
[91:29.08]Diva skin.
[91:32.19]Junker.
[91:32.84]It's just kind of dirty post-apocalyptic.
[91:36.23]Mustard.
[91:38.36]And this is the bumblebee one.
[91:43.38]I kind of have to get this if I'm going to have my whole mustard skin team.
[91:48.62]Because that's pretty mustardy.
[92:04.40]Does anyone else think this is funny?
[92:06.19]So this is supposed to be essentially like a screenshot, right?
[92:12.01]She's not, it's not like she's painfully standing.
[92:17.04]420 maize it.
[92:22.79]Talking about corn?
[92:24.94]Just subscribe.
[92:25.60]Thanks for subbing.
[92:26.83]Your friend Star rated me negative because I said Overwatch is dead.
[92:31.60]He was very upset.
[92:33.63]He's a fucking asshole.
[92:36.40]You know what?
[92:37.22]I don't like him.
[92:38.28]He didn't say anything to me.
[92:40.33]Like, why?
[92:40.83]Is he better than me?
[92:42.33]And why doesn't he reply to, like, donations and stuff?
[92:44.56]That's being a dick.
[92:46.39]He is a very bad person.
[92:48.44]I mean, you got that right.
[92:50.09]You should know that.
[93:00.98]Talk of the town right now, Star.
[93:04.48]Hey guys, TF2 is dead.
[93:06.18]Did you know?
[93:06.85]Go play Overwatch from my brand new favorite developer, Blizzard Entertainment.
[93:11.93]This is the home.
[93:14.02]You can't fucking believe that guy.
[93:15.69]There's like 50 fucking videos on his channel that are literally that.
[93:19.83]Just that.
[93:20.81]TFT is dead, go play Overwatch.
[93:24.23]Yeah, I mean, it's just...
[93:29.48]We should really just... Everyone just stop watching him, I think.
[93:35.47]He should just never be watched again.
[93:36.84]We should all sub.
[93:37.90]I think... Are you jealous that he has more subscribers than you?
[93:41.98]Because I don't think he should.
[93:44.25]Why does he have so many subscribers why it's insane I don't understand I think this guy's just fucking with us just boggles my mind
[93:57.43]Wait a minute, for a second I thought this was a real game.
[94:10.61]Just spamming the door.
[94:14.21]Oh shit, I hit the top of the van.
[94:21.49]Come here.
[94:22.74]Come here, you rotten fuck.
[94:26.86]I would be Junkrat right now.
[94:37.39]Hehehehehehe
[94:44.21]I love video games.
[94:46.32]Anybody else in here like video games?
[95:03.55]I don't even care.
[95:04.57]I just want to kill this guy.
[95:07.76]I got him in the head.
[95:09.09]I got him in the head.
[95:12.66]He got the health back.
[95:26.73]This is so dumb.
[95:33.48]Somebody kill him.
[95:38.12]I killed like so many people.
[95:40.34]I killed three people.
[95:47.40]Say, you want to do like the over-enthusiastic Boston guy?
[95:52.26]Sitting here in my car outside Harvard Yards with my Starbucks and my Cadigan.
[95:59.49]Mary, I did it just for you, chicken fingers, just for you.
[96:02.51]We can't lose this first point.
[96:07.75]He slit his throat like that.
[96:11.65]Poor old lady.
[96:19.35]Praise man.
[96:20.48]Crazy man.
[96:23.66]Welcome.
[96:24.06]Thanks for stopping by.
[96:27.75]Welcome to the trash cans.
[96:31.18]You know, you guys can call yourselves whatever the hell you want.
[96:33.63]Nobody needs to go by a certain label here.
[96:37.30]We can just be whatever.
[96:38.70]You want to be a jock shocker?
[96:39.93]A shit eater?
[96:41.60]A piss drinker?
[96:42.47]A trash can?
[96:44.18]A trash man?
[96:45.30]You do whatever you have.
[96:47.94]A champagne toaster?
[96:48.94]A roller coaster?
[96:51.48]Jimmy Roaster.
[96:55.37]Be whatever you want.
[97:03.78]Oh shit.
[97:07.37]Fuck!
[97:21.08]The Jerm shockers.
[97:32.43]Someone fight.
[97:40.55]I think they might have a Hanzo guys
[97:52.78]cooties I haven't heard that term in a long time
[98:08.90]Mercy.
[98:13.58]Damn it, there's just too many Genjis everywhere.
[98:17.57]I'm gonna get him!
[98:18.47]I'm gonna get ya!
[98:24.31]just too much.
[98:25.61]It's too much.
[98:27.36]It's too much.
[98:29.95]It's too much moving around and I can't handle it.
[98:35.80]Did that guy just ricochet kill me?
[98:47.17]The dragon becomes you!
[98:48.43]The dragon becomes you!
[98:56.54]Fresh man.
[99:00.21]Terpo the Magnificent.
[99:02.44]You magnificent bastard.
[99:03.91]Welcome.
[99:04.95]Thanks, Seven.
[99:14.81]in the head three times.
[99:16.00]It's a fourth headshot.
[99:26.22]Where are they all?
[99:46.12]He's still alive!
[99:53.17]It's just crazy.
[99:55.28]It's crazy.
[99:57.49]Why do I have 400 HP?
[99:58.75]This is the tavern brawl.
[100:02.67]Alright, you're gonna have to help me with your name.
[100:11.23]Okay, the guy that just mashed his keyboard.
[100:13.32]I will forgive you, guy.
[100:15.88]Thank you for summoning me, welcome.
[100:21.94]Where is everybody?
[100:38.50]He's gonna get the health.
[100:43.00]Totally worth $5 to be called a magnificent bastard by my favorite YouTuber.
[100:46.25]Well, thank you.
[100:47.79]Welcome.
[100:52.93]Much love, dude.
[101:05.46]Hey, it would be really great if I could hit one of those.
[101:07.24]I hit one out of like 15 right there.
[101:17.60]This is harder actually than the real game.
[101:27.01]I'm having more trouble with this than anything else.
[101:34.15]He got me.
[101:36.68]He got me with a jab.
[101:38.88]Shit, who just got... Combusting... Jeez.
[101:42.70]Combusting Fetus, apparently, is this dude's name.
[101:47.16]Welcome.
[101:48.09]Thanks for subbing.
[101:50.45]Welcome to the group of people that we're about to lose.
[101:52.76]We're going to lose.
[102:04.90]Too many Genjis.
[102:05.87]Too many other Genjis.
[102:06.89]Let me rephrase that.
[102:12.69]Can we like reflect off of each other?
[102:14.97]Into each other?
[102:19.19]Where?
[102:19.53]Is it in this corner?
[102:20.58]This guy, he's just a phantom.
[102:29.59]It's the strange name subscribing time, it seems.
[102:32.64]How do you phonetically pronounce your name?
[102:40.17]I'm really actually, I'm curious.
[102:41.35]I need to know.
[102:45.67]He got me.
[102:49.95]Holy Macintosh.
[102:52.16]Holy shit, a Macintosh.
[102:53.99]Like an old one from 1996.
[102:54.99]Thanks for subbing.
[102:57.38]Welcome, dude.
[103:04.38]This one guy is still here.
[103:05.59]I killed him.
[103:18.37]It's so hard to tell who has low health.
[103:21.37]They're all the same Genji.
[103:30.54]Oh, where?
[103:36.38]Klefka.
[103:37.28]Okay, I got you.
[103:39.82]Got you.
[103:40.26]Welcome.
[103:40.60]Thanks, dude And on the point
[103:51.83]They can win, fuck them.
[104:00.01]I'm dead.
[104:03.97]That's the funny part watching people trying to figure out how to pronounce the name.
[104:10.43]Well it is an interesting one.
[104:16.49]Ooh, this is as contested as I've seen this point in 10 years.
[104:24.81]Thank you for watching!
[104:29.30]This might go on forever.
[104:40.86]I would not be surprised if this went on like forever.
[104:48.92]More like Genji ult.
[104:55.50]Damn it.
[105:04.58]Yeah, forget about the point, it is a deathmatch, you're right.
[105:09.46]No, we're still contested.
[105:18.45]That guy's just blocking the way.
[105:31.24]Dude, forget about even trying to do anything, just dash people.
[105:46.30]I see the evil in you.
[105:53.30]I kinda don't want to do this anymore.
[106:01.42]We're still on it.
[106:04.34]And this guy from the rafters just jumps down.
[106:06.49]This guy just jumps down.
[106:09.64]Finally win.
[106:10.96]Oh my god.
[106:11.50]It's over took so long.
[106:13.95]Nice job guys.
[106:14.93]Nice job.
[106:15.57]Yes.
[106:16.14]It's suicide watch for them Isn't it?
[106:19.63]Who has the coolest Genji skin?
[106:22.59]That's the most important thing.
[106:27.76]Thank you for watching!
[106:33.55]Yeah, the person that got the last kill is the one that wins.
[106:36.38]I got the last kill of the game, so that means I win the game.
[106:40.72]What the hell is this?
[106:46.90]Why is it just me and this guy?
[106:48.24]Don't like the other guy.
[106:51.00]WK... Wixstar.
[106:54.09]Wix... WKXTC8989.
[106:59.86]And LumX24.
[107:02.40]Both subscribed.
[107:03.01]Thanks, guys.
[107:03.46]Welcome.
[107:07.60]Getting a headache, so I gotta ollie out.
[107:09.49]That's a great term.
[107:11.26]Getting a headache, so I gotta ollie out.
[107:12.80]Thanks for streaming, Jerma.
[107:13.77]Glad I got to catch you play.
[107:15.62]Well, thanks, Jamie.
[107:19.97]That's a great way to say you're leaving.
[107:26.29]Make a trash emote.
[107:31.34]Maybe.
[107:33.13]Maybe.
[107:35.35]I start eating garbage.
[107:45.03]I kind of want to play Zenyatta again, but people will be mad at me.
[107:54.77]If all 12 people just AFK all match, what would the play of the game be?
[107:59.63]I don't know.
[108:01.19]Maybe it would just randomly pick one of the people that were standing still or somebody should just pick up a health pack.
[108:08.89]Cause I'm sure that's like a quarter of percentage of a point.
[108:18.37]Well, we're not even in a game right now.
[108:27.39]We got like some characters on the voice channel today, don't we?
[108:32.53]I've been prepared my entire existence.
[108:36.14]Who speaks?
[108:41.51]Where do you hail from?
[108:43.08]It is ex-
[108:50.84]He was about to go off on a whole story too.
[109:09.59]I wanted to hear where he was from.
[109:10.79]I wanted to hear his story.
[109:19.23]He didn't break character.
[109:20.40]That's good.
[109:30.19]The game couldn't handle that much depth.
[109:34.03]That's funny.
[109:42.61]Where's your silly ass been this whole beta?
[109:44.39]I've been around.
[109:45.82]I've been playing.
[109:47.09]Look, I'm all 55.
[109:51.69]That's 54 more levels than one.
[109:56.35]New characters.
[109:57.76]Look at the guy all the way to the right.
[109:59.02]New character.
[110:09.51]Oh, you have the Fireman Mei, or the Firewoman Mei.
[110:20.77]A lot of people over there.
[110:28.95]Holy shit, you're a guy that's right here?
[110:40.09]Where is this Tracer that's shooting at me?
[110:46.54]Is she dead?
[110:47.89]I didn't kill her.
[110:51.77]I thought that was gonna insta-kill her.
[110:53.35]She was so close to it.
[110:59.62]I tried to do it again.
[111:10.20]I didn't hit anyone?
[111:11.08]What kind of fucking wild world is that?
[111:23.83]Aw, the last explosion killed me.
[111:25.78]It was worth killing him.
[111:34.41]Mmm, get there, get there, get there.
[111:44.79]Huh?
[111:46.12]Did he destroy it?
[111:48.81]What the fuck was that?
[111:49.84]It just kind of stopped.
[111:59.88]No, I'm not playing Junkrat right now.
[112:10.88]Again, it's just weird.
[112:12.93]I got some latency delay here.
[112:14.90]How do you check ping?
[112:18.67]Isn't it one of the F keys?
[112:28.97]Whoops, that's the wrong button.
[112:30.79]How do I check it?
[112:35.08]Something still doesn't feel right with my...
[112:38.56]I usually had it at 14, but something doesn't feel right.
[112:42.79]I feel like I'm way too high or way too low.
[112:47.71]I don't understand what happened.
[112:49.66]It doesn't feel correct to me.
[113:07.51]Holy shit.
[113:08.70]Really?
[113:13.30]Dremel confirmed way too.
[113:14.50]Alt F4, is that how you do it?
[113:17.99]Alt F4, okay.
[113:19.42]Alt F4.
[113:20.90]Got ya.
[113:24.20]Control-Shift-R. Oh, damn.
[113:29.75]Yeah, I'm at like 200 ping.
[113:32.78]That's not good.
[113:36.57]It's a ping issue.
[113:37.63]That's what happened.
[113:38.44]That's why I'm losing.
[113:53.77]Why do I have such bad ping right now?
[113:55.35]What's the deal with that?
[113:58.98]Maybe I shouldn't be playing this kind of character then.
[114:13.21]This is an EU server.
[114:16.46]I mean, it kind of has to be, right?
[114:17.44]Even if I was connecting West Coast, it would be...
[114:19.31]I'd probably have less than 100 things.
[114:25.22]It'd be like 90 or like 100.
[114:33.51]I got Fred.
[114:35.22]I just killed Fred.
[114:53.71]I kind of just did that just to be fun.
[114:55.93]Look, they're all like hiding in the corner.
[114:57.96]That was fun.
[114:59.39]Let's move on.
[115:00.51]It didn't even matter.
[115:05.35]It's a server in Brazil.
[115:10.18]Well, I don't think I'm going to play this character.
[115:13.41]I'm just going to play Torbjörn or something.
[115:15.72]I'll play Reinhardt.
[115:17.41]I'll just hold the shield up because...
[115:19.71]I personally, in my personal opinion, I think anything over 150-180 is borderline you can't even play the game.
[115:29.50]That's just my own personal opinion.
[115:30.93]I'm just very used to like 30 ping, like 40 ping.
[115:37.39]Although it doesn't feel laggy.
[115:39.35]Maybe I'm just like...
[115:40.47]I don't know.
[115:46.29]Once you get around the 200 ping region, it's like, it's hard to do really anything.
[115:57.58]Like all wrapping around.
[116:04.56]Ooh, he's low too.
[116:06.80]There's a Tracer behind me.
[116:13.66]Stop making excuses.
[116:14.65]No, I played like shit last round.
[116:16.20]That's not...
[116:16.58]I'm just making a general statement.
[116:29.99]First thing I thought they were like sneaking in this window.
[116:36.46]That would have been so cool.
[116:44.22]We're all kind of bunched up here.
[116:50.47]There's a tree behind me.
[116:57.65]Can we kill her?
[116:59.85]God.
[117:02.76]I'm so sick of you right now.
[117:11.78]Oh, he put me in the fucking toilet bowl.
[117:19.78]He got somebody else too.
[117:22.69]Are you serious?
[117:24.81]Did I seriously just get toilet bowled?
[117:27.66]I actually got... Wow.
[117:34.20]I've never seen that.
[117:38.04]That was great.
[117:41.41]That was a big turd.
[117:50.34]This thing's freaking out.
[117:53.21]What the fuck just happened?
[117:54.42]I just teleported.
[117:56.73]What the fuck?
[117:57.03]Come on.
[117:59.25]I could have got at least one or two people there.
[118:03.68]Okay.
[118:06.27]I shot a fucking 160 pig.
[118:12.58]I'm gonna win too.
[118:19.40]Okay, what do we want?
[118:21.74]Achievement unlocked.
[118:22.50]Get flushed down the toilet.
[118:30.73]Play of the day.
[118:33.43]That's a cool highlight intro.
[118:42.97]Yeah, you get a user teleport boost.
[118:45.68]Why am I getting all these achievements right now for getting to level 25?
[119:25.93]So, something I haven't really talked about, you know, we do every 13 minutes do gameplay tips.
[119:30.96]Um...
[119:32.23]So if you're playing as Reinhardt, holding the shield up and blocking the damage, right?
[119:37.61]Once you get to about...
[119:39.96]I'd say 700 damage.
[119:41.78]Back up, drop the shield, recharge.
[119:44.63]It takes a few seconds, but you want to always be up above 1400 shield.
[119:49.88]That's your 13th minute on the dot tip.
[119:53.78]And we'll get back to the action.
[119:55.43]I still have 160 pink, so I'm going to leave.
[119:59.75]We'll open up our box.
[120:05.43]It's just a blueprint.
[120:09.93]Just a blue.
[120:20.64]I already have like half of these.
[120:22.53]I don't have that.
[120:23.37]I'll take that.
[120:28.61]No, I don't like that.
[120:30.99]I like my bum.
[120:40.00]Okay, that's much better.
[120:49.09]I can work with that.
[120:50.00]This is great music by the way.
[120:58.86]That's a very good thing.
[121:02.88]This is definitely an East Coast server.
[121:04.28]Hooray.
[121:04.76]What the hell happened to my voice?
[121:11.47]What's that?
[121:12.93]Yeah, this is definitely an East Coast.
[121:17.09]I just like choked on my own neck.
[121:28.04]Just a skirmish though.
[121:29.93]Please don't have me in a 25 ping skirmish and put me in a 180 ping game.
[121:35.40]That would make me very sad.
[121:40.07]Puberty again, Jerma?
[121:45.71]Yeah, the second time.
[121:46.65]Second puberty is when you hit over 30 and you just start to get old.
[121:52.00]First, you go through first puberty.
[121:54.39]Second puberty is you start to turn into a decrepit old person.
[121:58.71]And that happens the second you hit 30.
[122:00.61]Your body just goes to shit.
[122:03.58]I know from experience.
[122:13.62]Alright, we're on a 24 ping server.
[122:19.23]That's good.
[122:32.55]Wait a minute, did this already start?
[122:35.73]Oh, I guess.
[122:36.55]Somebody must have quit.
[122:39.44]Okay, well that was jarring.
[122:47.39]He's so close to being dead.
[122:58.05]That was too jarring.
[123:05.98]You spent the last five minutes editing me calling you a bastard?
[123:11.08]Well, put this in the montage.
[123:13.32]Put this in your clips.
[123:16.28]Hold on.
[123:17.04]I've got to kill a guy.
[123:18.45]Or I'm going to explode from an orb.
[123:21.12]Durpo the Magnificent.
[123:22.57]Durpo the Magnificent.
[123:23.41]What a cool cat.
[123:25.78]One of the coolest cats I know.
[123:27.07]There you go.
[123:43.73]Did somebody just say Tabasco sucks?
[123:48.61]Nope.
[123:50.96]Hanzo seems like a bad idea here.
[123:53.77]It is.
[123:56.40]But...
[123:58.66]I've done stupider things.
[124:02.45]This fucking guy.
[124:04.75]I can't even shoot him.
[124:15.59]I feel like I should just... For a second, I just thought that was not our...
[124:20.76]You know what, I think I might go for a little bit of dispersion here.
[124:23.05]Yeah, I'm gonna go for it.
[124:44.16]health.
[124:44.66]Shit he did.
[124:50.36]He got the health.
[124:56.70]Where the hell?
[125:02.27]I was just out of its reach.
[125:08.51]This Tracer, I keep wasting my Scattershot on her.
[125:21.67]Come on, let me get you one more time.
[125:26.06]Where is he?
[125:32.32]Where did he go?
[125:33.25]Again, the tracer again.
[125:36.40]I gotta stop doing that.
[125:44.02]Oh that was a dumb idea, I shouldn't have gone that far.
[125:54.97]Has this game been released already?
[125:56.49]No not yet.
[125:58.51]May 24th, I think is the date.
[126:03.19]Open beta is in the first week of May.
[126:06.52]Something like that.
[126:10.17]Denied.
[126:15.89]Denied.
[126:28.45]He just saved his life.
[126:30.24]Fuck!
[126:30.58]I missed!
[126:31.08]I missed!
[126:33.75]I thought I was getting hit from behind.
[126:35.30]I didn't know the F-U-C-K was going on.
[126:41.04]Holy shit.
[126:44.92]I just had no idea there was a person shooting people from behind.
[126:58.33]Can you only get into the beta if you pre-order?
[127:00.19]No, not right now.
[127:02.65]This is a closed beta right now.
[127:17.93]Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm.
[127:36.46]And now I'm gonna save it.
[127:41.25]I don't want to use it right now.
[127:44.40]Don't think that'd be smart to use this at the moment.
[127:48.42]Maybe in like 10 years or something.
[127:50.92]Like right now.
[127:54.55]Seriously didn't kill anybody
[128:01.55]Time to switch off Genji.
[128:03.49]I'm gonna go Torbjörn for the last push here.
[128:12.18]Fill them up, break them down!
[128:19.59]How are people playing Dark Souls 3 already?
[128:21.52]I don't know.
[128:23.81]I have no idea.
[128:26.34]I'm definitely not one of those people though.
[128:55.16]This is a better pick for right now.
[129:00.31]Don't ask me how it got killed that quickly.
[129:06.10]I gotta get some scrap.
[129:11.50]Genji being a real pain in the ass.
[129:19.66]Oh, not worth it.
[129:21.83]Give that to somebody in the night mile, so I'm thinking in a good spot.
[129:25.42]Kind of.
[129:25.82]Yeah.
[129:32.62]It actually... Well, this is a total mess.
[129:43.61]What a mess!
[130:01.09]Oh shit!
[130:02.92]Oh boy.
[130:04.01]We're okay.
[130:06.67]Don't worry.
[130:12.36]Keep it alive.
[130:21.58]I should probably give you some armor, but I don't have enough scrap.
[130:25.88]Ah, shit, it's just barely behind us.
[130:28.77]Maybe one day he'll get it.
[130:32.71]Holy crap.
[130:33.95]Holy crap crap crap.
[130:46.89]I think we're okay.
[130:53.44]Yeah, you use the metal for armor packs.
[130:55.15]So when I go like this, I throw an armor pack on him.
[130:57.56]So when he needs it, he's going to get it.
[131:00.33]He'll suck it up.
[131:05.37]Here comes the last push, I have an ultimate ready for them.
[131:14.63]Damn.
[131:15.68]Okay.
[131:17.26]Hey, remember the thing that was supposed to be for you?
[131:19.61]Well now it's for me.
[131:27.83]Oh, boy.
[131:30.63]Bad.
[131:32.02]Bad.
[131:39.54]FAD!
[131:45.31]FAD!
[131:51.34]There was a sniper that killed me?
[131:52.89]Of all the people?
[131:54.97]Was I frozen?
[132:00.90]Just get on it, don't let them win.
[132:03.22]This is so important that we win this game.
[132:06.29]We lost.
[132:07.50]Whoa!
[132:10.51]What?
[132:12.64]Oh, it was the... How much damage did that just do?
[132:17.44]Jesus.
[132:19.58]Well that was dumb.
[132:27.62]Stop spamming the point with armor packs.
[132:39.23]I'm gonna die here.
[132:40.69]How am I still alive?
[132:43.97]Another one ult into the other.
[132:45.32]Jesus.
[132:50.38]I went for the scrap.
[132:53.15]I shouldn't have ran on the point like that.
[132:55.17]I think we might win.
[132:59.53]Did we just win?
[133:03.49]We won.
[133:12.43]I need armor.
[133:17.75]Fire at your service!
[133:26.97]Yep.
[133:27.89]Hey, look, I'm just like in an ult.
[133:30.78]Play the game.
[133:34.87]Play the game.
[133:47.99]I got pulled into a wall and shot Mei with a shotgun.
[133:53.28]I did it.
[134:15.21]Hey, who's a good dog?
[134:17.38]Hey, good dog.
[134:20.78]Show cam?
[134:24.07]No, no cameras.
[134:32.20]Because then I have to put like a t-shirt on.
[134:38.04]Prepare to attack.
[134:40.51]You guys know this.
[134:41.45]The reason why my camera is never on is because... What's happening here?
[134:51.00]Oh, I'm gonna have to decline.
[134:52.67]I'm playing solo watch right now.
[135:03.51]Put a clown costume on.
[135:07.16]Yeah, just like, oh, you turn on your webcam, but then I have to put on clothes.
[135:12.60]You know, that just sucks.
[135:16.31]Who wants to wear clothes?
[135:28.08]But Breedog is auto, he's...
[135:31.08]Something that I'm not sure.
[135:33.11]He's a rescue, so...
[135:35.61]He's a dachshund?
[135:37.00]Something?
[135:37.42]Mix?
[135:37.98]We think maybe... Chihuahua?
[135:40.45]Maybe Beagle, Dachshund, Jack Russell?
[135:44.91]Not entirely sure.
[135:45.79]There's no real data on it because he's a rescue.
[135:48.84]Right, Otto?
[135:51.85]Hey, what are you looking at, huh?
[135:56.92]What are you looking at, little dog?
[136:05.96]Once they come out with a skin that's that face, him without the mask on, I will open a thousand boxes to get it.
[136:21.66]What is this guy doing?
[136:22.82]This guy's just jumping everywhere.
[136:25.15]Just flying around.
[136:27.66]Shit.
[136:40.22]Just too much stuff on the way.
[136:49.99]My ultimate is ready.
[136:52.21]Go.
[136:52.41]I'll be watching over you.
[136:58.49]Damn it.
[136:59.06]I kind of knew that was going to happen, but I'd rather she wasted on that than anything else.
[137:10.26]You're a tracer.
[137:17.18]Shit.
[137:22.78]Man, oh man!
[137:25.17]Can't get anybody killed.
[137:27.83]They're all playing like squirrely fucking jumpy characters.
[137:37.37]That's the recall.
[137:39.09]Of course.
[137:39.53]Of course.
[137:51.23]I hope this doesn't kill me.
[137:55.03]Whatever it is.
[137:55.67]There it is.
[137:57.56]Don't kill anybody.
[138:01.67]Again, it might have to go with Reinhardt.
[138:05.59]Yeah, I'm not gonna...
[138:07.65]Even if I grab people, it's not really gonna do much, considering half of them can just get away.
[138:15.58]I'll do the ult though.
[138:25.08]I thought he was going to keep going, but he didn't.
[138:27.51]Fuck this.
[138:27.99]Let's just go.
[138:31.10]This is everywhere.
[138:33.21]Nope.
[138:33.94]Okay.
[138:34.83]Well, we walked in the front door.
[138:36.13]That's a new thing we haven't done.
[138:48.87]Yeah, I gotta play... We gotta play something that... Reinhardt.
[138:53.88]We can at least push in.
[138:59.18]I don't really have very many good targets.
[139:07.98]Of course.
[139:13.70]What do we have for her?
[139:17.51]I guess we do have a Tracer.
[139:32.31]At least he's dead.
[139:33.74]That guy's been a pain in the fucking ass.
[139:38.46]Thank God somebody can kill him.
[139:48.34]Dude, double Reinhardt?
[139:50.24]Alright, fine, I'm down.
[139:52.78]I'm down.
[139:59.60]Yes you are.
[140:08.53]Welp.
[140:10.72]Did something.
[140:12.90]Did something.
[140:20.44]We need more tanks.
[140:23.43]We need like 10 tanks.
[140:26.75]And I do mean people on their team should Twitch the tank.
[140:34.31]There he goes.
[140:37.48]We have double Reinhardt shields.
[140:39.67]Protect both sides.
[140:41.91]It doesn't matter.
[140:43.42]Their Ultra Genji is on their team.
[140:50.80]Yeah, let's play the game.
[140:51.57]You just killed four people.
[141:04.01]Jesus.
[141:05.50]Oh my lord.
[141:10.18]just make a giant turtle shield for Reinhardt nope
[141:20.06]I got someone.
[141:32.05]Here's the four per- we tried to do like the turtle shield, but we were both facing the wrong way.
[141:38.92]Didn't really matter, you can just go through it anyways.
[141:54.63]It's the skin.
[141:55.22]I've got to put a different skin on.
[141:59.66]It's definitely...
[142:00.54]The skin was just bothering me.
[142:02.01]I had to put a new skin on.
[142:05.38]No, not this one.
[142:06.39]What was the skin I wanted to change?
[142:09.38]AKA excuse to get out of that game.
[142:12.49]Okay, let's go.
[142:18.95]13-minute tips.
[142:19.79]Yeah, that's right, 13-minute tips.
[142:22.21]So when you're playing as Roadhog, your secondary special ability is a heal.
[142:29.28]Now, you might want to be using that heal all the time, but you need to strategically use it.
[142:33.84]Let's say you get less than 25 HP.
[142:36.67]Use it there.
[142:44.99]Come back to Zenyatta.
[142:46.10]I don't give a shit.
[142:53.39]Yeah, as in you gotta get nerfed.
[142:54.98]Real, real hard.
[142:57.45]Actually, I wouldn't even call it a nerf.
[142:58.53]They just, like, changed the way... Eh, it is a nerf.
[143:01.09]Let's stop beating around the bush.
[143:11.58]Got your tip.
[143:14.96]Gameplay tips.
[143:19.17]This is just a skirmish.
[143:25.57]That was uncalled for.
[143:26.32]You didn't need to do that.
[143:28.12]I just ate like four arrows.
[143:37.69]So those of you that don't know the change, for those of you that are just kind of coming in recently,
[143:42.13]The Orb of Discord and the Orb of Harmony have been changed.
[143:45.06]Now the Orb of Harmony and the Orb of Discord
[143:48.13]If you don't have line of sight of the person you put it on, it comes back to you in three seconds.
[143:53.91]So if I put Ormaharmony on a Pharah, then she jumps away from me.
[143:58.04]If I still can't see her, if she goes behind a wall, I will get it back.
[144:04.69]If it's been three seconds.
[144:05.93]Same thing with Discord.
[144:16.13]You'll see it in action here.
[144:21.23]Because I'm gonna play Zenyatta and get yelled at.
[144:28.99]Twenty-five HP require further clarification on these instructions?
[144:36.03]I'm not a good tip channel.
[144:37.18]I said that so people would think I was credible.
[144:44.94]Alright, so ready?
[144:45.52]Here you go.
[144:46.80]Alright, Mei.
[144:48.25]I'm Zenyatta.
[144:49.06]Take my Orb of Harmony.
[144:51.47]You're good to go.
[144:52.29]There she goes.
[144:55.04]Oh, I have it back.
[144:57.14]There's the change.
[145:03.95]If you ask me to tell you personally, I think it ruins the character because Zenyatta...
[145:13.27]It's fun to just throw it on somebody and kind of set it and forget it.
[145:16.69]You know, Ronco, Ron Papil.
[145:20.04]Now you really have to pay attention on exactly who it's on and keep them in line of sight if you want to keep it on that person, which...
[145:28.39]I'd rather they just have done it to Discord, like I said before.
[145:33.47]But whatever.
[145:35.40]I'm not gonna be a complainer.
[145:45.72]Holy shit.
[145:48.01]Did he actually just hit me with that?
[145:49.24]Was I standing that still to get hit by it?
[145:55.98]Apparently he just perfectly timed it.
[146:02.27]I have to pay attention, BabyRage.
[146:06.69]No, now it's just, why wouldn't you just play Mercy at this point?
[146:09.23]Because if you have to, like, be behind the person, if you have to, like, see them.
[146:12.26]I'm gonna wait.
[146:22.54]Like, I wish I could stay on this guy, but I have to keep looking at him.
[146:34.35]I thought he was gonna attack that guy.
[146:46.47]Repetition is the path to mastery
[146:57.98]Come here, Vince.
[147:02.41]Vince McMahon.
[147:17.42]Embrace it.
[147:23.82]Who needs heals?
[147:32.67]I can see you.
[147:34.16]Go around.
[147:38.86]Go around town.
[147:40.87]Two snipers.
[147:51.08]I kinda wanna just use it.
[147:54.63]Yeah, I should have.
[147:55.93]No, there's only two people.
[147:58.06]I shouldn't have done that.
[148:00.31]I would have just wasted it, pretty much, because that would have saved one person's life.
[148:05.80]I'm more like two, but in my own.
[148:09.07]Probably should have done it now that I look at what just happened.
[148:27.18]I thought I was going to get headshot right there.
[148:28.61]That would have been so embarrassing.
[148:31.05]I got shot right in the face.
[148:35.05]Jeez.
[148:44.86]Kind of want to ult, but there's nobody to do it to.
[149:02.45]Yeah, they do show the skins now.
[149:04.56]You can see my bird man.
[149:07.91]Which is cool because there's really no reliable way besides emotes to even know what skin you have on.
[149:13.84]And eventually down the road, it's gonna be a pretty big deal if there's a dozen skins for each character.
[149:22.61]Is the raging Australian.
[149:25.55]Just subscribed.
[149:27.36]Welcome, thanks for subbing.
[149:30.99]Wish I could have healed you.
[149:42.49]Alright, I'm just gonna ult.
[149:43.71]Let's just go in there.
[149:45.24]Just going over here and doing it.
[149:58.95]Geez.
[150:00.69]We didn't kill either one of those two people?
[150:02.50]They were just like locked in the corner.
[150:11.55]I'm playing a different character, I'll play Lúcio
[150:22.33]Careful Mei.
[150:50.92]Watch it!
[150:54.42]Pretty good commentary, right?
[150:55.52]The last, like, minute here.
[150:57.41]Watch it!
[150:58.97]We're doing a real good job here with this commentary.
[151:03.93]Hey, look out, there's a guy there!
[151:06.10]Alright, let's be quiet for like another two straight minutes.
[151:21.36]Wall ride.
[151:23.67]I gotta get the wall ride achievement.
[151:35.49]Then I start eating garbage.
[151:43.10]Danny DeVito really is like one of the greatest people ever.
[151:55.96]Now I get insta-killed.
[152:05.41]Never a good feeling when you get insta-killed by a Widowmaker.
[152:09.96]Some in fact would say it feels like shit.
[152:17.17]Come back over here.
[152:17.77]I can heal you.
[152:25.66]I'm just going to ult.
[152:27.54]Let's go.
[152:44.57]Go back to Torbjörn.
[152:47.11]We never really seem to be together for ults.
[152:50.93]That's why I just kind of did it for no reason.
[152:57.53]I'm gonna play the other support character, Torbjörn.
[153:15.67]I'm gonna play support character number two.
[153:19.12]And that's Torbjörn.
[153:24.85]The trash man for Jerma Rumble.
[153:26.64]Danny DeVito was already in one.
[153:28.83]That's just Danny DeVito.
[153:31.40]Would he just come back as the trash man?
[153:44.18]Okay, I'm gonna push up a little.
[153:46.04]I wanna get right in their faces.
[153:58.98]Two and a half minutes?
[153:59.62]I think I can do it.
[154:01.42]I think I can hold the fort down.
[154:06.13]By I, I mean we.
[154:07.62]Because there is no I in team.
[154:09.41]There's an E, an A, and an M.
[154:11.68]And a tea.
[154:13.11]More importantly, there's a tea.
[154:15.67]That's it for tea.
[154:29.01]Gosh, somebody's coming to kill the Reinhardt that's just back here.
[154:36.71]Oh, no.
[154:44.09]There is a me in team.
[154:45.51]Yeah, I guess there is.
[154:52.32]Oh, I had an ult.
[154:55.91]I had an ult.
[154:56.87]I was just waiting.
[154:57.48]I was getting too greedy.
[154:58.34]I wanted to get to level three.
[155:00.19]Let me lose.
[155:07.83]The names keep popping up.
[155:26.83]Jeez.
[155:32.03]Snipers doing what they do.
[155:34.14]Sniping people.
[155:42.91]It's all my fault.
[155:47.87]Did I finish?
[155:48.47]Wait, did Sorcery Part 4 come out?
[155:49.75]Is that what you're trying to tell me?
[155:51.77]If Sorcery Part 4 came out, I'm going to drop everything and go play it.
[156:13.91]I can take that off.
[156:14.87]It doesn't need to be on anymore.
[156:18.12]I'll just make sure.
[156:22.54]Yeah, we're good.
[156:30.72]Again, I really do believe it's a Winston day.
[156:34.13]All of my good games, my decent games, whatever, have been on Winston today.
[156:51.15]I don't currently have a stream schedule.
[156:53.57]I just kind of do it when I have some time.
[156:55.20]When I know I can go for at least a couple hours.
[157:00.43]I probably never will either.
[157:01.38]I'm not good with schedules.
[157:03.39]You guys know this.
[157:04.51]I'm so bad.
[157:05.25]I tried it before and it just didn't work.
[157:18.15]Scream schedule?
[157:19.64]Yeah, I scream maybe once every two hours.
[157:22.61]I let out just a belly-belting scream.
[157:26.15]I wake up my neighbors.
[157:29.23]My dog starts barking.
[157:30.84]The neighbor's dog starts barking.
[157:32.95]And I just scream, I'm sorry, too.
[157:35.36]I just have to do it.
[157:36.37]I'm on a scream schedule.
[157:37.54]I had to scream.
[157:40.75]Neighbor just goes like, shut the fuck up, dude.
[157:43.82]Sorry.
[157:44.17]You don't know what it's like to be on a scream schedule.
[157:50.32]Lately, these last couple months, I've been streaming at least four times a week.
[157:55.13]I've been going pretty much as much and often as I can.
[158:05.96]Damage boosted dude over there.
[158:12.63]She just went behind everybody?
[158:13.92]Nope.
[158:20.72]Just want to make sure no one was up there.
[158:21.85]I just want to sneak a peek.
[158:25.14]Thought someone was behind me.
[158:30.73]Alright, we're gonna go.
[158:31.40]We're gonna go for...
[158:32.45]If you touch the rims, you lose.
[158:35.46]Damn it, I lost.
[158:36.10]Damn it.
[158:39.07]I wanted to really just... What are you doing?
[158:42.68]Come on, beast man.
[158:43.50]Let's go.
[158:48.70]Come on, Beastman, you can get out there.
[158:50.57]Shoot him.
[158:51.23]Use your arrows.
[158:53.30]Shoot those arrows.
[158:58.25]He's gonna- see he's gonna come back, he's gonna- yeah bro!
[159:00.08]Bang!
[159:13.12]Yeah.
[159:17.86]You just noticed that Winston's gun is a Tesla leaf blower?
[159:22.96]That is a good way to put it.
[159:25.05]It is a leaf blower.
[159:26.96]That's awesome I think we're gonna lose this game
[159:38.18]judging by how fast we lost that first point.
[159:41.35]And yeah, that's, yeah, that's a, uh, yeah, hold on.
[159:47.60]I'm having second thoughts here.
[159:56.76]Having second thoughts.
[160:07.86]Give me the heals.
[160:08.93]Repair yourself.
[160:11.52]Okay, I need to get a bear spot up here.
[160:18.55]Do you think these people on this road are looking over here, saying, geez, Carol, what's going on over there?
[160:24.41]I'm seeing all kinds of explosions.
[160:27.38]I hope everything's alright.
[160:29.83]I think they might appear right here in like five seconds.
[160:38.80]At least one of them.
[160:46.38]Just any minute now.
[160:48.72]We're just kind of hanging out.
[160:50.43]Yep, this is where we hang out and then we unload.
[160:56.18]There was too much smoke in my eyes.
[160:57.44]That was bullshit.
[161:01.66]Why did I have a smoke grenade in my face?
[161:04.77]What the hell was that?
[161:09.56]Since when are smoke grenades in Overwatch?
[161:21.35]Get on the point
[161:28.14]Once we have a second here.
[161:31.01]Hey, you're blocking my view.
[161:34.39]You're in my dash.
[161:35.89]You're in my dash cam, man.
[161:39.07]Now, what happened if we just got capped right there?
[161:42.84]We would have been destroyed.
[161:43.94]It would have been terrible.
[161:57.60]I'm so scared that there's like a Genji that's gonna wrap around our Tracer.
[162:00.61]I do have an ult though.
[162:04.63]Melt the shield.
[162:05.75]That's all that matters right now.
[162:08.45]Okay.
[162:12.38]I need to move.
[162:13.69]I don't want to be standing here.
[162:14.57]This is a bad place to be.
[162:15.72]But I kind of... Yeah.
[162:20.62]I'm going to come out and ult.
[162:24.03]He's protecting me from hooks.
[162:26.76]Yeah, maybe.
[162:28.63]But they don't have a Roadhog.
[162:32.06]Just in case they might have had somebody switch to Roadhog.
[162:53.49]Get it down!
[162:56.19]How is he eating this?
[162:59.08]How did he eat that whole thing?
[163:02.62]It didn't even look like it was doing damage to it.
[163:06.32]He must have been at full 2,000 or something.
[163:08.30]That was crazy.
[163:12.68]Yeah, I... Usually Bastion holding down on a Reinhardt shield, it disappears.
[163:18.31]Especially that close.
[163:24.63]the game.
[163:37.38]Bring back JermaCraft.
[163:38.83]I'm not gonna do this again, are we?
[163:40.76]More JermaCraft.
[163:45.19]More Minecraft.
[163:49.43]Epic.
[163:51.07]Wonderful!
[164:11.76]Have I ever played a tabletop RPG before?
[164:16.39]Um... No, are you talking about like Warhammer?
[164:23.79]Because Warhammer is one of those games that is, you know, you have little squads and you have your little figures.
[164:30.04]If that's what you're talking about, no.
[164:32.26]I have played my fair share of kind of board games that have RPG type mechanics in them.
[164:41.71]but not a legit tabletop RPG like Warhammer.
[165:03.99]What do you think of the new animated short, Recall?
[165:07.73]It was good.
[165:09.66]It was definitely cool.
[165:10.50]It was definitely cool.
[165:11.04]I mean, it was long.
[165:11.85]It was a lot longer than I thought it was going to be.
[165:14.18]I thought it was going to be like less than three minutes.
[165:18.92]But I'll tell you a criticism I have about it.
[165:22.36]As much as I thought it was cool, it kind of, to me, just felt like the cinematic trailer again.
[165:28.84]Same characters?
[165:31.07]Same kind of concept?
[165:33.49]Uh-oh, Reaper's here to steal something.
[165:35.56]There's gonna be a small fight here.
[165:37.04]Oh, it's alright, it's over.
[165:38.45]Winston!
[165:40.34]It was kind of just the cinematic trailer a second time, but in a different place.
[165:46.70]But it was very well made.
[165:47.86]It was very well done.
[165:48.55]And if they're going to...
[165:51.02]If that's what we're talking about for track of where they're going to go with it...
[165:56.21]In regards to quality and length, I'm all for it.
[165:59.83]I'm happy to see what they do next.
[166:11.96]Damage boosted Winston.
[166:15.66]Not so sure about this one.
[166:23.69]Yeah, I played D&D.
[166:26.34]Only like two times, though.
[166:28.33]And it was just with friends joking around.
[166:29.70]We weren't really taking it 100% too seriously.
[166:41.41]I just barely snuck out of that one.
[166:50.34]Thank you for the heals.
[166:52.29]Very much so.
[167:05.05]He's got a lot of health.
[167:08.76]What the hell?
[167:09.33]There's a Reaper?
[167:12.44]Yeah, I'm pretty sure all the characters we made when I played, we all died.
[167:15.74]Like permanently dead.
[167:17.97]All I remember is drinking silver liquid from a fountain and it killed me.
[167:21.95]And I was dead the rest of the game.
[167:34.85]Gotta get around somehow.
[167:50.07]He's so close.
[168:00.23]Where's he shooting it from?
[168:04.19]The hell is he?
[168:05.55]He's like in the sewer.
[168:06.58]Oh, he's down there.
[168:11.87]Since when did he go in the sewer like a Ninja Turtle?
[168:13.80]That's what I want to know.
[168:18.39]That's death if I go fight him.
[168:21.51]He's still trying to shoot me too.
[168:30.50]What?
[168:34.64]What?
[168:35.12]Oh, Jesus.
[168:37.71]I didn't even know that was in there.
[168:41.89]I was going to say, I just did my ult.
[168:43.86]How did I die that quickly?
[168:45.57]The fucking wolf dragon was in the corner of the room I was in.
[168:49.02]I didn't even know it was there.
[169:01.81]We should cap it.
[169:03.95]That's all that matters.
[169:09.21]Okay, no, like, reapers up here.
[169:11.88]That's a good thing.
[169:12.74]Okay.
[169:18.05]I could have sworn there was going to be one back there.
[169:33.87]Not good, not safe, not safe!
[169:39.73]Unsafe.
[169:52.65]Look at this, damn.
[169:55.48]I'm killed again, fast.
[169:59.35]He just used his ult on nothing, that's good.
[170:06.91]Get some dudes in here.
[170:07.89]That's a bad, it's a losing battle.
[170:18.22]Don't want to get killed by Junkman.
[170:20.32]I do have almost, I do have almost ult.
[170:28.64]Almost.
[170:47.49]Focus it on me, I don't care.
[170:56.86]Where's he shooting it?
[171:12.59]That website never works for me.
[171:14.03]It says something along the lines of error on the line 5 at column 418 in the entity reference expecting.
[171:20.00]That's weird.
[171:23.45]Yeah, I've never seen that before.
[171:24.56]I always thought it'd be fun to play D&D.
[171:30.73]with a good DM that has a massive imagination.
[171:44.55]Because some DMs really can create this crazy world with all this cool shit in it.
[171:57.51]Your friend was a halfling whose father was Demon Lord Zaraxos, and he was cast out of the Ninth Inferno to kill the Slim Jim Man.
[172:07.48]That's a pretty deep backstory.
[172:09.60]That's a pretty beak.
[172:10.72]That's a pretty beak.
[172:12.86]I like that beak.
[172:16.22]A massive imagination.
[172:21.77]Why don't I be the DM?
[172:22.80]No.
[172:24.76]If I was a DM, here's how it would go.
[172:27.75]I'd come up with something really weird.
[172:29.72]I'd be like, alright, so you guys, there's a dragon swooping down.
[172:33.05]crashes into the top of the castle, smashes, and he lands.
[172:37.22]And he says...
[172:38.14]Cretan humans, how dare you just try to get in my cave?
[172:42.41]And he flies off into the distance and there's a missile flies...
[172:45.80]And I'd stop right there and I would forget where I was.
[172:48.93]Uh...
[172:52.59]Except there was a missile.
[172:54.07]Uh, so what do you guys... What do you guys do?
[172:58.76]I can't keep a story going like that.
[173:03.50]I'd come up with something really cool for like 15 seconds, and then I would just not care.
[173:08.12]I'd lose everything.
[173:12.80]Skyrim.
[173:33.86]I'm gonna get some kills with McCree.
[173:41.56]I want it to be a McCree day so bad, but it's just not gonna be.
[173:45.30]I don't know what I'm doing and why did I change off Winston?
[173:58.55]so badly wants to be a McCree day.
[174:06.82]I didn't even know the trap was there.
[174:07.97]Look at all the debris on the ground.
[174:09.53]How the fuck was I supposed to see that?
[174:13.39]There's shit everywhere.
[174:17.50]Yeah it is the skin, I don't have it.
[174:38.58]Get me out of there.
[174:40.77]Stay behind the Reinhardt shield.
[174:44.57]What?
[174:45.17]Huh?
[174:45.83]Who?
[174:47.26]Who?
[174:49.33]I wasn't behind the shield?
[174:52.79]Huh?
[174:55.34]Really?
[174:56.67]Did he take it?
[174:57.72]I'm confused.
[175:04.11]He just phantom pulled me.
[175:21.37]What the fuck?
[175:29.07]It's so funny if I just shot the Reaper on the ground
[175:37.03]That was just a perfect ult.
[175:38.68]And if it was play of the game, how funny would that have been?
[175:42.08]Oh, I'm fucking... We're done.
[175:45.42]I'm playing a different character.
[175:46.41]This is just stupid.
[175:49.71]He blew that up.
[175:51.75]Like, so far away from me.
[175:59.75]Hold on a second.
[176:01.80]No, my ping is fine.
[176:03.15]I was just curious there.
[176:12.46]I think we lost.
[176:13.86]I'm pretty sure we lose the game right here.
[176:17.00]Okay.
[176:18.16]Game over.
[176:28.62]Alright, let's see.
[176:32.88]Where are we?
[176:33.48]We are there.
[176:37.30]Okay, I'm gonna find my house.
[176:39.44]I'm gonna have Google Maps go in.
[176:40.93]Alright, my house is right...
[176:43.70]There.
[176:44.56]Found it.
[176:49.06]Can't blame ping this time
[176:54.81]No I can't.
[176:57.85]I don't have the ultimate backup excuse.
[177:00.57]It's not there right now.
[177:17.63]Don't get flushed down the toilet again.
[177:19.26]It happened before.
[177:19.89]I don't want it to happen again.
[177:27.09]How did you get back here?
[177:29.08]He just walked around, of course, how did we get back there?
[177:31.48]What do we have for support?
[177:32.93]We have a Mercy.
[177:39.53]not fail again
[177:47.92]Man, they're all just always behind this Reinhardt.
[177:53.23]I want to flush somebody.
[177:58.67]If only I could flush a guy down the toilet, my life would be so much better.
[178:07.11]Not going...
[178:10.18]I was gonna go for a flush on somebody.
[178:11.64]I want this healing pack.
[178:19.09]Shit, I didn't even get it.
[178:21.82]The tracer got it.
[178:25.53]Can't you just press a button as Tracer and heal?
[178:29.81]Isn't that a mechanic in this game?
[178:35.62]I think we're gonna get shot out again.
[178:53.75]What a tightly packed group.
[178:55.95]Get flushed.
[179:12.53]I have time to do one ult.
[179:22.57]I'm just gonna die here.
[179:24.93]No, fuck you!
[179:26.14]I even pressed Q and it didn't work.
[179:37.39]Round two lost.
[179:47.07]Do an ultimate flush.
[179:56.54]Did that guy get flushed?
[179:58.11]No he didn't.
[180:10.22]20 killstreak.
[180:11.87]This guy didn't die one fucking time the whole game.
[180:16.41]Now fuck you all.
[180:18.75]No one's getting a vote from me.
[180:21.39]You want a tip?
[180:22.62]You want a tip?
[180:23.22]13-minute tip?
[180:27.45]Rage quit.
[180:44.68]Sometimes it's necessary.
[181:03.45]The problem is I just stopped playing Winston.
[181:12.81]I just have to only play Winston.
[181:14.37]That's the only thing I'm allowed to play for the rest of the stream.
[181:24.42]I am covered in my new skin that I got like two months ago.
[181:43.90]Get on the cart.
[181:44.77]We can move it.
[181:54.39]This map again?
[181:55.06]I think it's the same team.
[182:01.09]I think it's a lot of the same people.
[182:03.28]Only Winston.
[182:04.72]Only Winston.
[182:06.59]If I don't play Winston, then I will lose.
[182:10.63]Only Winston.
[182:25.46]You're hungry?
[182:25.98]What should you eat?
[182:27.75]What's in your area?
[182:28.47]Anything good?
[182:33.93]Did you get a pizza?
[182:40.43]Could suck down a pizza.
[182:42.43]One of those personal ones.
[182:43.30]The little small ones.
[182:44.62]They're like 12 inches.
[182:57.46]How do we know this isn't just pre-recorded footage?
[182:59.45]He's just running.
[183:00.03]He could be eating and laughing at chat right now.
[183:02.42]That'd be pretty funny.
[183:07.93]Just sitting there with a bowl of cereal, laughing?
[183:10.95]Like, why would I be laughing and eating?
[183:13.60]Couldn't I just be laughing?
[183:14.52]Why do I have to be eating, too?
[183:17.17]Like I'm just sitting there like... Look what that guy said.
[183:25.88]Something about that is funny.
[183:36.64]Heal up!
[183:44.25]Going in behind.
[183:44.98]Watch this one, I'm gonna drop down right here.
[183:51.61]I can't fit, I'm too big.
[183:53.06]I'm too fat to fit in there.
[184:19.27]Let's go.
[184:24.88]My lord.
[184:26.70]Why are we all stuffed in the hull?
[184:28.12]Both teams are stuffed over there.
[184:32.29]My god.
[184:33.30]Don't follow me in here, Junkrat, please.
[184:36.58]Ugh.
[184:52.46]Nobody even know the point right now, I don't think.
[184:54.57]Oh yeah they are now.
[185:07.12]to be.
[185:14.97]I'm not even sure, was that his death thing?
[185:18.24]I guess, yeah.
[185:28.40]Onward and upward.
[185:37.70]Cap it.
[185:41.99]Get it capped.
[185:44.35]Can we please get at least 1%?
[185:45.63]Just one percentile.
[185:51.36]Where the hell is he?
[186:14.05]Die!
[186:20.09]Who's our healer on our team?
[186:20.94]Do we have a... Yeah, Lúcio.
[186:23.80]Good.
[186:24.16]A Lúcio.
[186:38.15]Wow, don't be stuck!
[186:39.55]He just jumped in and threw that under me.
[186:47.34]Before he died.
[186:49.60]Ugh!
[186:58.80]What's going?
[186:59.36]Why is the chat robots?
[187:01.22]What the hell happened?
[187:03.03]Did we get the robot invasion here?
[187:08.00]I want to knock this guy off.
[187:13.70]No, I was standing on it.
[187:17.04]I was standing on that
[187:26.43]You're all germobots now?
[187:36.47]Oh, alright.
[187:42.54]I guess that's what we're doing right now.
[187:46.73]Four, three, two, one.
[187:59.82]Nice jump.
[188:00.71]I just got like stuck in a tile.
[188:03.15]That was fucking stupid.
[188:15.16]Ooh!
[188:16.02]Yes!
[188:16.85]Yes!
[188:18.72]You actually pulled the lever to flush that guy.
[188:21.01]That's the greatest part.
[188:25.15]That guy actually flushed the toilet.
[188:33.82]Real life toilet flush guys
[188:52.49]No, don't give me the health.
[189:07.68]Overwatch is real life.
[189:11.84]It is.
[189:12.14]Don't you remember the Omni Crisis?
[189:17.04]All those robots.
[189:18.85]See, it's happening right now.
[189:19.59]The Omnicrisis is happening again.
[189:21.16]With all these fucking robot people.
[189:31.30]He almost flushed me.
[189:32.48]That doesn't count as a flush.
[189:39.03]That doesn't count as a flush.
[189:44.26]He killed me before I got flushed.
[189:46.44]I was like a dead goldfish.
[189:51.18]Don't get bunched up for this.
[189:53.53]Don't get bunched up for this.
[189:58.83]Jeez.
[190:06.72]Further experimentation required.
[190:14.21]Subs are affected by slow mode?
[190:15.62]What?
[190:16.17]That really shouldn't be.
[190:17.25]What the fuck is that?
[190:18.56]I thought I changed that.
[190:27.92]I don't want to flush myself down the toilet.
[190:30.59]That would be bad.
[190:32.61]Where's the Genji?
[190:40.61]Just trying to spook him.
[190:56.08]High noon.
[191:00.31]Damn.
[191:01.32]I thought he already did it for some reason.
[191:02.80]I thought he shot it before.
[191:13.04]Damn it.
[191:15.14]Yeah, I gotta fix that then, if that's true.
[191:21.71]If that is true, that needs to be fixed.
[191:26.78]Damn.
[191:27.75]Okay.
[191:40.61]Nothing can stop the blob.
[191:51.57]Where do you think you're going?
[191:55.20]Where are you going?
[191:57.55]Alright, I'm out.
[192:10.50]And that should be a victory.
[192:12.80]Maybe not.
[192:21.28]Ooh.
[192:24.44]No, I hear the Roadhog ult.
[192:28.18]We did it.
[192:31.59]trying to flush myself.
[192:37.08]Alright, this is the one.
[192:38.51]This is the one we gotta win.
[192:39.94]This is the winning one.
[192:47.19]Uh, Anto, Anto Joe P wants to do a toast to the subs.
[192:52.24]Alright.
[192:57.18]A toast to everybody.
[193:13.00]Yeah!
[193:15.63]Nobody?
[193:16.53]Nobody over on that side?
[193:17.70]Okay... Hello!
[193:30.32]Get off me.
[193:31.50]You hear what I said?
[193:32.63]I said get off me.
[193:36.71]Damage boosted McCree.
[193:40.12]That's nonsense.
[193:47.55]Yeah, open beta is for like a few, three or four days?
[193:51.89]A week or something?
[193:54.14]Actually, I don't really know.
[193:55.12]That's a good question.
[194:00.34]Stay on the point.
[194:16.30]Wow, that's a lot of people over there.
[194:23.58]That's a tough one.
[194:24.80]That's a tough one.
[194:25.46]That's a tough one.
[194:29.14]You drink my champagne?
[194:31.61]What if I made a product?
[194:33.05]Would you guys buy it if it was a champagne?
[194:35.48]Those of you that are of age.
[194:37.51]Ready for transcendence.
[194:43.51]I'm gonna set my alt.
[194:53.50]I love how we're all just waiting for it to happen.
[195:06.10]He's stuck in the stupid trap right where he died.
[195:10.42]Oh, that's such... That is such... Look at this!
[195:12.59]Look at that!
[195:13.05]Such dog shit in a fucking taco!
[195:16.35]Fuck that!
[195:20.02]Just panic fucking dropping his fucking bear trap and he dies in the perfect spot for me to eat all the grenades.
[195:27.79]God, I hate this game.
[195:29.81]I hate this game.
[195:36.36]Mr. Sark?
[195:43.26]The Mr. Sark?
[195:45.45]Sark?!
[195:49.41]Welcome, Mr. Sark.
[195:51.22]Thanks for subbing, welcome.
[195:56.20]It's been a while.
[195:56.84]I think the last time I talked to Mr. Sark was we were on a balcony at PAX Prime 2012.
[196:07.48]And we did a really nice firm handshake.
[196:09.60]That's all I remember.
[196:20.30]Everyone just stuff on it.
[196:23.90]Just gotta kill the Mercy.
[196:25.61]Don't really know where I am, but I guess not.
[196:34.26]Finally.
[196:39.76]We can't lose.
[196:40.86]We can't lose.
[196:41.49]We lost.
[196:42.79]I can't...
[196:44.80]Fucking, there's your tip of the game.
[196:46.21]Fucking rage quit.
[196:48.91]13 minutes.
[196:49.73]There's your tip.
[196:59.86]Tough breaks today.
[197:00.76]I haven't had, like, any fucking good games.
[197:04.03]I've had, like, two good games out of the 200 I played today.
[197:12.53]Check my phone, have I been like messages?
[197:17.45]No, not even any messages.
[197:21.05]Nobody like texted me today.
[197:23.98]He fucking likes me.
[197:35.02]Play another game.
[197:35.77]I think this has probably been my last game.
[197:38.98]I have some things I could do today.
[197:41.09]I gotta work on some stuff.
[197:55.90]This is the final game, so I'm just gonna play... What am I gonna do for the final game?
[198:07.57]before I karate kick through my window.
[198:18.24]Do the daily brawl.
[198:19.01]I did it a couple times.
[198:20.43]Like an hour or two ago.
[198:28.03]Somebody texted me.
[198:30.10]I got a text.
[198:33.25]You got me.
[198:34.07]You got me.
[198:36.67]I lawful welcome, thanks for subbing man.
[198:40.54]Welcome to the family.
[198:41.93]I got a text, it was Star.
[198:44.44]Oh my god, look at this.
[198:45.89]It says... Dude, don't worry about it.
[198:48.28]We all have bad games sometimes.
[198:50.03]You've been playing pretty well.
[198:51.28]Your Winston game is on point.
[198:53.40]Keep your head up.
[198:54.50]Nice.
[198:55.52]Thank you, Star.
[198:56.90]Thank you.
[198:57.48]Wow, that... And I love it with the sub.
[199:00.01]Yeah, I feel better now.
[199:00.83]Thanks, man.
[199:01.41]Thanks, guys.
[199:10.40]Thank you.
[199:33.82]What a nice thing he said.
[199:35.12]That's really kind of him.
[199:43.53]He did, he said that.
[199:53.16]I don't need to be judged right now.
[200:02.09]What's making that noise?
[200:04.24]What's that?
[200:04.76]You sound like an old cartoon missile falling.
[200:06.78]Attackers incoming in 30 seconds.
[200:22.79]I'm going to send you another message this time, but it'll be mean.
[200:31.52]Uh oh, Reinhardt.
[200:41.49]They've got a Reinhardt.
[200:43.43]Gotta make sure I communicate with the team.
[200:57.35]I have a Widowmaker?
[200:58.83]Is that the thing I'm seeing right now?
[201:11.71]I'm going to give it a pass.
[201:19.63]Oh, I thought, I thought I was gonna get out of that, but I did anyways, that's okay.
[201:35.56]They always have a pea-sized amount of health left.
[201:39.90]Okay, I don't know about you guys, but I think I was very clearly not there for her to shoot.
[201:45.65]Let's find out.
[201:48.84]Did I really get in the shoulder blade?
[201:55.44]That's why the compulsive jumping doesn't really help.
[202:01.34]He's gonna get it with a pea-sized amount of health.
[202:06.15]Yep, somebody's having a good.
[202:08.47]Nice green bean health pool you have there after I pull you.
[202:21.41]Damn it, really.
[202:22.01]Thanks for the boost.
[202:38.55]You're not gonna get away.
[202:40.84]I promise you that.
[202:42.89]I promise you're not gonna get away.
[202:49.34]She's just bouncing around back here.
[202:51.23]I promised everybody you weren't getting away.
[202:54.45]You're still here.
[202:59.63]Sometimes you gotta break a promise.
[203:03.76]Nobody on point, we're fine.
[203:12.05]Oh, okay.
[203:15.22]Did that really just go all the- How am I still living?
[203:19.31]How am I still alive?
[203:20.72]I don't understand.
[203:21.62]I cannot give you a play-by-play of why that just happened or how I'm still living.
[203:32.55]Apparently, we're all okay.
[203:35.69]I need to heal, though.
[203:41.11]Told you, promise fulfilled.
[203:44.11]She didn't get away from me.
[203:45.36]I ended up getting her eventually.
[203:55.60]Nope, I didn't want to do that.
[204:02.38]I'm just so scared of getting like, ulted right there.
[204:13.59]Where's the sniper?
[204:17.20]Where?
[204:17.66]Where?
[204:18.00]Where?
[204:19.69]Oh, you're dead.
[204:29.95]Ooh, you got me right in the cup.
[204:44.58]Right in the cup.
[204:45.88]Right in the jock's rep.
[204:50.60]There she is.
[204:51.28]I'm gonna get this son of a bitch.
[204:52.79]Watch this one.
[204:56.69]Ah, he got her before I could.
[205:01.40]I would've too.
[205:02.12]I would've.
[205:07.44]Here we go.
[205:14.61]Oh!
[205:18.53]Y'all know if that was a quarter of an inch higher, that would have been play of the century.
[205:28.69]Just out of reach.
[205:38.53]Keep them off the point.
[205:39.23]That's all I care about.
[205:41.25]Just use it so they don't get on the point.
[205:42.43]Someone, who's on it?
[205:51.70]We're good.
[205:54.56]Not good.
[205:58.01]Okay.
[206:03.10]Did I get locked down?
[206:07.97]That was a good one to go out on.
[206:15.38]Wait, I did a Homer Simpson?
[206:16.57]Did I really say, like, yo?
[206:24.64]Alright, guys.
[206:27.11]It's been real, it's been fun.
[206:29.12]But I'm gonna get going.
[206:33.28]I shall return.
[206:36.14]Probably tomorrow.
[206:37.34]Maybe even tonight, too.
[206:38.33]It depends on how I feel.
[206:40.08]I won't be playing Overwatch, so I'll play something else.
[206:44.29]but I love you have a good rest of your day or evening night morning wherever you happen to be in the world
[206:51.80]And, yeah.
[206:52.86]Take care, guys.
[206:55.20]See you later.
[206:56.39]See you later.
[206:56.69]See you later.
