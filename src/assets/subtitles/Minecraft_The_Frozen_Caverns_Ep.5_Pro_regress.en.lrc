[00:05.36]There's a creeper out here, though.
[00:07.78]Alright, we'll take care of him.
[00:09.40]We got three doors.
[00:10.90]We got two creepers, actually.
[00:12.56]That's the way to the creepers, actually.
[00:14.76]Alright, so let's go out the back door.
[00:16.10]Alright, I don't see anything.
[00:20.16]Oh, I'll be right above you.
[00:21.14]Run, run.
[00:21.74]Alright, we're good.
[00:23.73]We're good.
[00:24.65]Okay, okay.
[00:25.43]We're good.
[00:26.63]We're good.
[00:27.93]Got that one.
[00:28.39]We didn't shut the door, though.
[00:29.35]Alright, we'll shut the door after we kill this bastard.
[00:34.14]You're going to blow up?
[00:34.66]What are you doing?
[00:35.14]I'm pushing him back.
[00:36.66]I'm doing like the sprint attack.
[00:37.96]He's chilling on top of the tree now.
[00:40.94]He's like, I'm pretty cool up here.
[00:42.20]I'm pretty cool.
[00:42.60]Is he like a tree frog?
[00:43.56]What is he doing?
[00:45.24]I think with 1.2, it's like they're more scared to jump down.
[00:51.17]They really are.
[00:52.79]I'm going to try and... Wow, he really isn't coming down.
[00:56.25]Oh, there he goes.
[00:58.33]Watch out.
[00:59.74]There we go.
[01:00.16]Oh, nice.
[01:01.16]Got a nice little crit hit on him.
[01:02.86]Close that door.
[01:04.30]Close the door.
[01:05.52]And onwards we go.
[01:06.64]Alright, so I... For those of you that don't know, I just ruined everything, essentially.
[01:14.75]I broke a bunch of stuff because I fell in the lava with the enchanted bow, and pretty much I'm just a terrible person.
[01:21.51]So that's that story.
[01:25.03]Hold shift from now on.
[01:26.39]That's what we gotta do.
[01:27.09]We just gotta, like, cross the bridge.
[01:28.80]Oh!
[01:29.90]I totally forgot about that.
[01:31.86]While holding shift.
[01:33.12]If you hold shift, then you won't fall through.
[01:36.84]And also, for those of you wondering, Lepter is away on vacation.
[01:42.05]So we had to continue on briefly without him.
[01:45.85]Yep.
[01:47.07]And he should be back pretty soon.
[01:51.61]Man, the one block wide stuff's really scary.
[01:55.45]Yeah, I couldn't believe I fell through that.
[01:58.84]I couldn't believe it.
[02:00.53]Just gonna stay on the railroad track here.
[02:02.99]We need to get some redstone so we can power this thing so we can just, like, cruise back and forth from one side to another.
[02:09.86]That's gonna be cool.
[02:11.60]We had a bunch of redstone, and I think somebody fell in the lava with it.
[02:15.96]I think it was Lepter, though.
[02:17.18]I don't know.
[02:17.54]Oh, you sure it wasn't me?
[02:19.70]I'm pretty sure he was the one going around getting all the chests, so... I think it was him.
[02:25.95]And let me see if there's anything in these chests back at Swan.
[02:28.53]Hmm.
[02:30.21]I feel like I took everything out of it already, but I don't know for sure.
[02:34.09]Right, right.
[02:35.69]Because I remember the first time we were here, we left a bunch of stuff.
[02:40.34]Yeah, we've been leaving stuff in the chests a lot.
[02:42.34]The only thing we've got in here, like, I don't even know the first thing about potion making, so I'm just going to leave that in there.
[02:47.68]So just, what you're saying is just take them and drink them both right now.
[02:51.92]Well, I would, but it says no effect, so I'm just going to trust that.
[02:55.40]Alright, so what we're going to do, we're going to go up to our handy-dandy wheat farm up here.
[02:59.55]And we've got a bunch of bone meal that we collected from some bones from some skeletons.
[03:04.53]And we're going to make some food.
[03:06.27]Because we got... All I got is one piece of bread.
[03:10.85]And some food.
[03:11.31]Oh, look at this.
[03:12.07]A few fish.
[03:13.39]Our efforts are starting to pay off.
[03:15.37]They are, they are.
[03:16.51]So I'm going to use it on the ones that are, like, the least grown.
[03:20.27]Good idea.
[03:22.77]And then replant, and then be on our way.
[03:24.87]Actually, no, we have to craft the wheat.
[03:29.36]Which is... I got a crafting table right here.
[03:33.52]Oh, there you go.
[03:35.30]Is it three or two?
[03:36.38]It's three in a row, horizontal.
[03:38.78]Okay, yeah, I have two.
[03:39.62]Take them.
[03:42.84]And that will give me 13 total.
[03:45.92]Which should be enough for...
[03:49.65]Four.
[03:51.63]That should be enough for four.
[03:53.27]Okay, I think that's all the dirt that we have.
[03:56.71]Dirt's pretty hard to come by.
[03:57.81]It really is.
[03:59.36]I think this is it.
[04:00.20]This is all we got.
[04:00.88]So now I've just got a bunch of seeds I can't do anything with.
[04:05.78]Let's grind them into coffee.
[04:08.94]I guess I'll take the crafting table with us.
[04:11.36]Just in case.
[04:14.58]Take the traveling workbench.
[04:15.82]We're going to need it.
[04:17.97]Alright, and it looks like there's at least two areas over here that... We'll go exploring.
[04:23.41]Yeah, there's something to explore.
[04:24.53]There's something across the way by that cull, and then there's the little... the little spider webs down at the bottom.
[04:30.50]So which one do you want to go to first?
[04:33.30]Let's take on the spider webs.
[04:35.20]The spider webs down here?
[04:36.24]Okay.
[04:36.58]Yeah, let's go to the spider webs.
[04:39.50]I gotta... I gotta overcome my fear of arachnophobia.
[04:43.62]I don't know how to really destroy spider webs.
[04:46.28]Maybe a pickaxe?
[04:47.77]This faster?
[04:49.31]They seem like they take a long time to break.
[04:51.99]Sword.
[04:52.89]Sword?
[04:53.33]Okay.
[04:54.59]You, sir, win.
[04:58.51]Alright, I guess... Whoa.
[05:01.47]There are some traps, apparently laid.
[05:04.30]And we've got a mob spawner right here.
[05:07.66]So, all I have to do is destroy it with the wooden pick before it spawns any pesky spiders.
[05:13.86]And there's a chest in here, too.
[05:15.79]You shouldn't attempt this if you are not yet ready.
[05:18.31]I have a feeling it's going to explode.
[05:20.07]That's what I feel.
[05:22.05]So I should open it then.
[05:22.99]Look down here.
[05:23.65]Look down here.
[05:25.83]Oh, wow.
[05:29.43]Frozen waterfall.
[05:31.29]That's pretty crazy.
[05:32.47]So, you don't think... You want me to open this?
[05:34.27]No, here's what we should do, okay?
[05:35.54]If one of us needs to stand, like, way back here, where it's safe, like, as far back as possible, I have the most stuff, so go ahead and open it, and if it starts hissing, run for your life.
[05:45.46]Okay, here we go.
[05:46.72]Oh my god, there's a lot of stuff in here.
[05:48.62]Is it hissing?
[05:49.90]No.
[05:51.08]I'm scared.
[05:51.84]There's a ton of leather, there's a ton of... I don't know, how do I take things really fast?
[05:54.36]There we go.
[05:56.84]Something's gonna explode in the distance.
[05:58.96]Alright, I got everything out of the chest.
[06:00.98]I'm stuck.
[06:03.42]What's going on?
[06:03.88]You're stuck in the spider web.
[06:05.76]Okay, that was... Yeah, you shouldn't attempt this.
[06:09.71]Yeah, right.
[06:10.93]I think maybe they mean the drop down here.
[06:12.77]Alright, I got a bunch of leather.
[06:15.83]Alright, let's go back over here where it's kind of safe and craft that leather into armor for you real quick.
[06:22.34]Yeah, make sure I don't waste it this time.
[06:27.25]Was there just leather in there?
[06:28.17]Was there anything else?
[06:29.37]A bunch of spider webs, a couple of bones, apple.
[06:35.44]So the bones can be put to use for the bone meal again.
[06:38.79]And apples, obviously.
[06:40.67]Food.
[06:40.89]I'm going to go ahead and collect this coal up here.
[06:45.48]Yeah, I'll get a full suit of armor after I get this last one.
[06:48.38]Yeah, there's definitely something up here, because just digging out this, like, couple things of stone, I mean, of snow, revealed some stone over here.
[06:55.34]Got a couple of rotten flesh as well.
[06:57.30]And a fermented spider.
[06:59.14]Okay, maybe not a good idea right now.
[07:01.11]Ow.
[07:02.25]What happened?
[07:02.59]What's up there?
[07:03.23]There's a couple skeletons.
[07:05.99]I'm trying to take care of them.
[07:09.13]Oh, I see you up there fighting.
[07:11.52]Okay, there's too many.
[07:12.20]I'm just gonna leave.
[07:12.80]It's not worth it right now.
[07:14.92]Oh, God.
[07:15.46]They're, like, stuffed in that room.
[07:18.27]They're shooting each other now and burning.
[07:19.81]Eat this, you punk.
[07:21.69]Oh, God.
[07:22.67]They're shooting each other up there.
[07:26.27]They're going back in now.
[07:27.13]They're like, eh, it's not worth it.
[07:29.35]Alright, I need to eat some so I can start healing.
[07:32.03]It's too bad we only have five loaves of bread.
[07:35.76]What does the apple do?
[07:36.84]Full health or full... I think it only gives, like, two health, actually.
[07:40.46]Really?
[07:40.78]I think so.
[07:42.38]I should probably just eat it now.
[07:44.75]Yeah, if you're hungry, go ahead.
[07:47.59]Yeah, it's two.
[07:49.51]I want to say the raw fish is just, like, one.
[07:53.12]So I think I'm going to go ahead and eat one of those.
[07:54.74]We got company.
[07:56.62]There's a skeleton coming down here.
[07:59.26]Well, with the update, they're going to stay in the shadow.
[08:02.40]So they're not going to follow you too far while the sun is shining bright in the sky.
[08:07.23]There's another one up there.
[08:08.73]I'll get him.
[08:09.13]I'll get this rat bastard.
[08:11.75]So do you want to go up?
[08:12.71]Oh, wow.
[08:13.47]Watch out behind you.
[08:14.35]Oh, no.
[08:18.67]Well, they just pulled out.
[08:20.87]It's alright.
[08:21.25]We're good.
[08:22.60]Oh, there's like a bunch of spawners in here.
[08:24.98]Do we want to do this first, or do we want to do like the waterfall thing first down there?
[08:28.57]Oh, well, I mean, I guess we're already in here.
[08:30.83]Might as well destroy the spawner.
[08:32.05]Okay.
[08:32.37]Uh-oh, watch out.
[08:34.68]Hit that guy.
[08:35.52]Yeah.
[08:36.72]Leave him alone.
[08:37.34]He's my friend.
[08:38.66]Yeah, one of us has to distract while the other one destroys.
[08:43.02]And if you want to destroy one, it's with your pickaxe.
[08:45.53]I don't have a pickaxe.
[08:46.77]Oh, yeah.
[08:47.19]Oh, whoa.
[08:48.33]Yeah, hit that guy.
[08:48.79]Oh, he's right there.
[08:49.37]Hit that guy.
[08:50.59]Yeah.
[08:51.21]Oh, I'm getting close to being dead.
[08:53.35]Close.
[08:55.45]How's your hunger doing?
[08:57.47]I got 70%.
[08:58.89]Alright, here, take this bread.
[09:01.70]And once your hunger's full, you'll start healing automatically.
[09:04.68]Okay.
[09:05.89]A bunch of coal, a bunch of arrows in this chest, bones.
[09:10.73]Do you still have a bow?
[09:12.47]I do.
[09:12.65]So I guess you took the arrows already?
[09:16.23]Yep.
[09:18.09]What we should do is, like, all these bones are going to be really valuable, so I'm thinking... Just put them in a chest?
[09:23.75]Yeah, like, make a chest over here.
[09:25.55]Do you still have the crafting table down here?
[09:27.71]It's still down there.
[09:29.39]Also, um... Oh, never mind.
[09:31.57]We got this heal pad out here, so if we start running out of food, we can, like, retreat...
[09:36.03]and, like, heal up.
[09:37.51]Alright.
[09:38.15]Nice, nice.
[09:40.35]Hey, you want me to throw these bones down to you?
[09:43.77]Oh, sure.
[09:45.52]Where should I... Oh, it's Creeper behind you.
[09:47.84]Creeper coming up behind you.
[09:49.88]Where did the Hs fall?
[09:51.56]I just like throw it down then.
[09:53.22]Like the water.
[09:54.64]I think I see him.
[09:56.54]Gotta watch out for this guy though.
[09:58.06]Oh wait, can I like shoot him with the... Oh, we got a zombie here too.
[10:01.44]Don't waste the arrows unless you have to, okay?
[10:03.00]He's in the water, so I'm just... Oh, now he's up.
[10:05.64]Man, they're crafty.
[10:06.62]They're cunning.
[10:07.40]Yeah.
[10:08.52]Watch yourself.
[10:09.28]Whoa!
