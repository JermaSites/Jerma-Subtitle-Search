[00:05.71]I can't get over how short you are.
[00:07.66]That's the funniest thing.
[00:08.64]You are four feet tall.
[00:10.50]I'm like normal human size, and you are four feet tall.
[00:17.98]Go stand next to that guy real quick.
[00:19.94]I want to see what happens.
[00:20.83]Okay, I'm going to go stand next to this guy.
[00:22.87]Oh my gosh!
[00:23.91]This guy is like a full two feet over me.
[00:37.41]I thought you would be a little bit taller being like the big bruiser
[00:51.49]Dude, you're like up to his chest too.
[00:54.74]You're like crouched down.
[00:56.04]What?
[00:56.96]What about when I walk?
[00:58.86]Hold on.
[00:59.20]Am I standing up straight?
[01:00.72]Yes.
[01:02.04]I'm standing up straight right now.
[01:03.68]Yes.
[01:05.12]So, okay.
[01:06.07]You go over there.
[01:06.67]You are like crouched down.
[01:07.93]Your body is crouched, like hunched over.
[01:11.75]I can't believe I'm that small.
[01:12.95]That's so funny.
[01:14.13]That's the best.
[01:16.11]You're like a legit midget right now.
[01:17.29]The berserker.
[01:18.39]The gunserker.
[01:19.63]You're a midget.

[02:14.87]That's because we're doing this again Good thing I already recorded this
[02:20.86]I got, like, my gun out.
[02:22.48]Yeah, me too.
[02:23.62]I'm on the ground.
[02:24.38]They're not gonna give me a weapon again.
[02:27.30]You're on the ground and we're not.
[02:29.00]Who's he looking at?
[02:30.52]Who's he looking at?
[02:32.91]Oh.
[02:33.39]Oh, hey, there we go.
[02:34.49]Hi.
[02:34.95]Hey, shorty.
[02:35.57]Give me a gun.
[02:36.75]Why are you so short, Gemma?
[02:38.61]I don't know.
[02:39.37]Oh, yeah.
[02:40.65]What viewers are probably not gonna understand because we have no bullets is we tried this before and we all, like, unloaded all of our guns and we had, like, technical problems.
[02:47.76]So we're just like, no, no bullets anymore.
[02:49.40]What?
[02:50.27]I've got a sniper rifle still.
[02:51.31]They never gave me a gun.
[02:53.87]Yeah, why don't you have a gun?
[02:54.81]I don't know.
[02:55.49]Why do you guys have, like, no health?
[02:56.85]Wait, now you have health!
[02:58.50]I just re-gymmed all of mine.
[03:00.34]I got all of mine back, because I'm a good siren.
[03:04.04]So, Stealth, you're the only first.
[03:06.00]They really screwed you, Stealth.
[03:08.00]Yeah, I know.
[03:09.30]This guy is claptrap and he's giving me my things.
[03:13.21]You're not going to have any health and no weapons.
[03:15.73]That's great.
[03:18.39]Look, there's the Hyperion ship in the distance.
[03:23.07]Where is it?
[03:24.20]Over there.
[03:24.54]Don't shoot it.
[03:29.92]Imagine if it just exploded.
[03:31.06]Imagine if it just exploded.
[03:33.60]That would be amazing.
[03:35.57]I love the reload animation for this sniper.
[03:37.67]Right?
[03:38.25]Oh, geez, yeah.
[03:39.85]It's like a revolver sniper.
[03:41.35]I still don't have a weapon.
[03:42.83]Look at all these Claptraps in the wall.
[03:46.29]I found the collectible.
[03:47.47]I found money.
[03:48.83]Except for this one.
[03:50.01]He's like warming up by the fire.
[03:51.56]Oh, I just tore that thing off.
[03:52.96]He comes here.
[03:54.44]Bandits, Vault Hunters, Claptrap units.
[03:57.12]I sound freaked about this.
[03:58.38]It's only because my programmers made just my default sort of voice.
[04:01.32]I'm actually quite depressed.
[04:04.32]The creatures around here are dangerous.
[04:06.44]None more than this bully-mong named Knuckle-dragger.
[04:09.11]He kills everyone I know.
[04:11.99]And you, I keep a pistol in the cabinet over there for emergencies.
[04:14.93]And here, we should be pretty safe.
[04:18.97]Oh.
[04:20.40]Whoa, whoa, what?
[04:22.52]Whoa!
[04:23.86]Wow.
[04:24.66]Look at that guy.
[04:27.52]Dude, that's like Goro from Mortal Kombat.
[04:30.30]Yeah, that's like Machamp from Pok√©mon.
[04:33.84]Machamp Ice Goron.
[04:37.64]What did they take from him?
[04:38.74]Oh, poor guy.
[04:40.94]Alright, so that's the waypoint.
[04:44.20]Just look around for everything.
[04:45.28]Just touch every button.
[04:46.86]Get a gun.
[04:47.38]I'm trying.
[04:48.04]Holy cow.
[04:51.31]Oh, there is.
[04:52.33]Okay.
[04:54.21]There's a bunch of dead guys here.
[04:55.43]Oh, we got porn.
[04:57.25]Come look at the porn in here, guys.
[04:59.93]Oh, look at those magazines.
[05:06.33]Uh-oh.
[05:06.73]Look at the sexy claptrap over the toilet.
[05:10.05]It does have like a bra and underwear on.
[05:13.63]I'm going to break that bully box.
[05:14.87]Alright, what is this?
[05:15.51]Is this like a teleporter?
[05:16.63]Fast travel?
[05:17.13]Yeah.
[05:17.43]I'm not going to run into anything.
[05:19.53]Oh, you're watching.
[05:21.71]I'll just assume you didn't see that.
[05:23.77]No, I tried warning you.
[05:27.14]Watch out, claptrap.
[05:28.08]Drag her blank side at me.
[05:29.61]I do much better with low sensitivity in these games.
[05:39.42]Can I say that I love the ice, like, part of this game?
[05:43.19]It's great.
[05:43.53]Already?
[05:45.01]Looks great.
[05:45.61]Uh, retrieve Claptrap's eye.
[06:00.35]This pistols the worst gun in the game Holy cow, you're fine.
[06:06.07]I didn't hit one person by the way.
[06:07.61]Yeah, good job guys Yeah, I didn't hit one bullet on anyone Blood we got this orange got this.
[06:17.55]It looks like slime.
[06:18.52]Oh
[06:20.36]I'll show you how to do it.
[06:22.38]Oh, let's do a duel.
[06:24.54]You accepted.
[06:25.16]Oh, no.
[06:26.12]Hey, poke a time to mess around here.
[06:28.58]I've got a sniper.
[06:30.96]Ah, guys.
[06:31.46]Guys.
[06:32.00]Did that get me a foot hit?
[06:35.04]There's stuff happening behind us.
[06:36.85]I was just like an avalanche.
[06:40.81]I just really got so scared right there that we were going to die at level one.
[06:44.01]Me and stuff were dueling.
[06:45.61]Oh.
[06:49.29]Dude, this girl takes up way too much of the screen.
[06:51.57]I can't see.
[06:52.31]Give me that.
[06:52.87]Yes!
[06:53.97]I took it.
[06:55.11]I don't know what I took.
[06:56.25]How do I inventory?
[06:57.90]Holy cow.
[06:58.64]Hey, there's monsters, by the way.
[07:00.44]We need to... Monsters!

[07:02.68]Oh!
[07:04.10]Oh, the hate!
[07:05.48]Hate, everybody.
[07:06.12]I just activated a fire ray.
[07:08.62]Critical hit, baby.
[07:12.46]Oh, this pistol.
[07:13.80]Why do you guys get real weapons?
[07:15.94]It's a big one.
[07:16.92]That's the big one.
[07:22.00]Is there bullet travel time in this game?
[07:23.66]I don't know.
[07:26.10]Oh, critical shot in the face.
[07:27.52]I don't remember there being, like, travel time with bullets in the other one.
[07:30.18]Maybe I'm just crazy.
[07:31.02]Come on, get out of there.
[07:31.86]Alright, get down there.
[07:33.68]Get down there.
[07:34.22]Oh, handsome Jack.
[07:37.01]This clap track has no idea what's going on.
[07:44.56]Run!
[07:45.38]Handsome Jack.
[07:49.42]I don't think Handsome Jack's that handsome.
[07:52.49]Ooh, health stuff.
[07:56.69]I would say something, but I'm not going to.
[07:59.01]How do you use the health injector again?
[08:01.75]About a certain person who thinks they're so handsome.
[08:06.25]I didn't I always all I said was a handsome Jack.
[08:09.43]It's not oh, God What's with the pendant on his neck I can't read that holy cow no gold you treat the same I

[08:31.79]Alright, keep jumping on the tallies.
[08:33.09]I'm fine with that.
[08:34.85]Yeah, go after a tallie.
[08:37.33]He's looking at me funny.
[08:38.45]He's looking at me funny.
[08:40.15]Look, he's like walking towards you while looking at me.
[08:44.83]This gun is so inaccurate.
[08:46.27]There's so much recoil on this thing.
[08:47.71]It's like un-aimable.
[08:50.14]Sniper, nice crit right there.
[08:52.31]Coming out of the walls.
[08:53.19]Oh, things, watch out.
[08:53.81]Does everyone else have a sniper?
[08:55.01]No, I have a pistol.
[08:57.05]And only a pistol.
[08:59.47]Punch in the face.
[09:00.49]Ow.

[09:08.76]Why are they all chasing me?
[09:09.98]Shoot them all.
[09:10.58]This sniper rifle's way better.
[09:13.57]Oh, he's back down on the ground.
[09:14.57]He's throwing snowballs.
[09:15.67]Throwing things at me.
[09:16.94]Get out of here.

[09:18.92]Give me all the drops.
[09:19.81]Give me everything.

[09:22.75]I'm stealing everything.
[09:24.28]Oh, I just got a pistol.
[09:25.88]Oh, good.
[09:26.44]Pistols.
[09:26.95]So good.
[09:27.71]I picked up like one thing of money.
