[03:43.04]Oh, happy St.
[03:47.36]Patrick's Day, everybody.
[03:49.53]I didn't even say that.
[03:57.39]This is a second live stream on YouTube.
[04:00.93]Hopefully it goes well.
[04:01.93]Hopefully nothing explodes.
[04:07.14]But yeah, happy St.
[04:07.74]Patrick's Day.
[04:11.96]May the luck of the Irish shine upon you.
[04:13.68]I'm going to find a better server than that.
[04:26.42]I do live in Boston.
[04:27.26]1, 2, 3.
[04:28.42]I'm reading it.
[04:29.82]All right, let's get this going.
[04:38.75]All right, hold on.
[04:40.73]I got to tell my Steam group what's going on.
[04:46.34]Because I'm trying to do the transition from Twitch to YouTube.
[04:49.94]So we'll see how it goes.
[04:52.44]I got a lot of mixed responses.
[04:54.23]A lot of people are like, no, go to Twitch.
[04:56.07]And then people say, no, YouTube is much better.
[04:59.19]It's torn between two different places.
[05:01.87]But eventually, I'm going to be able to stream in HD on here.
[05:05.15]So that should be pretty cool.
[05:06.77]And why can't I go to my Steam group?
[05:09.42]Oh, right.
[05:10.06]I'm not even online.
[05:12.88]Whoops.
[05:23.46]Let's get to an event.
[05:24.66]Saturday, YouTube stream.
[05:31.97]Oh, potty.
[05:40.19]And flame.
[05:46.73]Woo-hoo.
[05:53.52]Alright, let's get a server here.
[06:08.13]Has nobody in it.
[06:13.03]Alright, 0 out of 28.
[06:15.39]Arena Lumberyard?
[06:16.28]I don't know if I want to go there.
[06:17.52]1, 2, 3.
[06:24.63]Let's get 0 out of 32.
[06:25.27]Here we go.
[06:26.23]Here we go.
[06:28.37]0 out of 32.
[06:29.17]That's what I'm looking for.
[06:33.18]Warm Front.
[06:34.62]Casbah.
[06:37.92]King of the Hill Nucleus.
[06:38.76]Let's go to Nucleus.
[06:43.79]Alright, guys.
[06:45.49]This is the server I'm playing on right now.
[06:57.84]And here it comes.
[06:59.54]Will everybody go?
[07:00.34]Yo!
[07:08.17]My stream's broken.
[07:11.63]My stream isn't broken, is it?
[07:19.62]Try and refresh it.
[07:21.90]Give it a good old refresh.
[07:34.84]Alright, join that, uh, I just put a IP into the chat.
[07:38.46]That's where I'm gonna be playing.
[07:41.35]Oh, using the Floggestinator!
[07:51.05]I'm not gonna play with that.
[07:52.77]Play Soldier.
[07:58.78]Anybody even in here?
[07:59.42]Alright, Weston.
[08:03.84]If some of you guys could repost the IP, I'd be very grateful.
[08:14.31]Give him hell.
[08:16.41]What's going on, chicken?
[08:21.63]So I have a new mouse.
[08:22.99]We're going to see how well this goes.
[08:27.48]How did I not hit that guy?
[08:29.46]I got a razor death adder.
[08:32.24]Ow.
[08:37.14]Yeah, Razor Death Adder, it's the blue one, the one that lights up blue.
[08:43.48]Never gonna give, never gonna give!
[08:48.65]So, a lot of people can't load the stream.
[08:51.79]I wonder why.
[09:02.99]Everything should be the same as it was last time.
[09:10.85]Is more than one person having stream problems, or is it just one or two people?
[09:18.90]Error, huh?
[09:20.58]Hold on a second.
[09:29.38]That's weird.
[09:32.14]The people that are having problems, what country are you from?
[09:38.72]It might be because you're from a country that doesn't support it or something.
[09:42.50]YouTube is still in kind of like the beta streaming stages.
[09:52.61]Oh my god.
[09:57.47]I can't believe I... wow.
[10:02.83]Ow.
[10:05.92]Yeah, I guess if you're having stream problems, just close out your browser and then come back or clear out some of your cookies or something like that.
[10:15.40]I don't know, I wish I knew what was going on.
[10:17.98]If everybody was having that problem, I would be like, darn!
[10:20.30]I'd have to fix it right away.
[10:21.42]Oh, that was so lucky.
[10:32.31]Oh, you're not a spy?
[10:34.70]all the stuff like that now let let let me just look at my own stream see what happens pull it up for a second here to see what looks like for me speedy a see
[11:06.56]Why don't I just get a double ad?
[11:10.28]I got a double ad on my own stream.
[11:19.08]Offer a sacrifice to YouTube.
[11:20.72]I mean, it looks... Hey, I'll show you guys.
[11:22.20]We'll do streamception.
[11:24.08]It looks alright on my end.
[11:26.49]I don't know.
[11:26.85]I'm not sure, guys.
[11:30.67]I apologize if it doesn't look like that on your screen.
[11:36.20]Oh my god, look at all these people.
[11:37.94]High five, baby.
[11:40.92]Oh, we're gonna get spawn trapped.
[11:42.82]Everyone's just in here hanging out.
[11:52.80]Oh, crit screen.
[11:53.56]Oh no.
[11:55.70]Putting a lot of pressure on me here.
[11:58.81]No, that's not a spy.
[12:02.69]Oh my god.
[12:03.65]It's lagging so bad.
[12:10.19]Oh, God.
[12:13.37]I just hit, like, a lag patch right there.
[12:14.97]That wasn't good.
[12:18.31]Oh, yeah, I'll show my loadouts.
[12:20.09]Good call.
[12:20.79]Good call, Lou.
[12:21.72]Oh, I just missed your name.
[12:23.56]Good call, Phoenix.
[12:26.14]So right now I'm using the black box, the reserve shooter, and the equalizer.
[12:30.98]And I got this stuff on, too.
[12:40.72]There we go, let's do it.
[12:50.90]Alright, so I'm getting a couple more messages saying the stream is all screwed up.
[13:05.29]Now we're going to do this, ready?
[13:06.51]We'll do this.
[13:09.01]I'm not sure if I can even restart it, to be honest.
[13:12.23]It might, like, screw a bunch of stuff up.
[13:27.16]Yes!
[13:34.58]We'll go scout.
[13:35.94]They got the Mad Milk, the Stalk,
[13:40.18]Stuck.
[13:41.69]Aw, crap.
[13:42.97]No, die!
[13:48.91]Well, the only thing I can say is if people are still having problems, then this should be uploaded to YouTube within the next hour or two.
[13:58.20]You should be able to watch it on YouTube.
[14:07.63]I don't know, maybe I'll try restarting it.
[14:09.57]Because it looks like more people are having problems.
[14:16.71]Control point unable, get going!
[14:23.28]Yeah, it's a Razor Death Adder.
[14:26.12]I like it, it's good.
[14:27.70]I'm not a big fan of big, bulky mice, but this is, uh... This fits comfortably.
[14:35.68]Oh, damn.
[14:48.99]Oh my god, they're right outside the door.
[14:50.53]That just like scared the crap out of me.
[14:55.66]No, I'm going this way.
[15:00.16]Let's get out of here.
[15:01.32]Come on, Spy, let's get the hell out of here.
[15:05.44]I'm lagging so bad.
[15:08.10]Look at how bad I'm lagging right now.
[15:09.53]Everyone's like a freaking slideshow.
[15:20.45]Streamception.
[15:27.56]Did I kill that guy?
[15:29.18]I just confused myself.
[15:35.92]I can't believe I made it.
[15:41.64]Logitech all day.
[15:50.75]Yeah, actually, you know what?
[15:51.85]If some of you guys will notice, I have quick switch on now.
[15:56.55]I am not using the regular non-quick switch anymore.
[15:59.53]Because I can do stuff like this!
[16:01.75]See how I switched to that?
[16:02.59]Because I got a button on my thumb now.
[16:08.23]I can use the button on my thumb to switch to the, um, to the melee slot.
[16:14.13]Cool, huh?
[16:15.23]No more, uh, no more slow switch for Jerma.
[16:18.35]Those are the days of the past.
[16:24.19]Oh my god, so many people up there.
[16:27.96]Kris Kreeg, oh my god.
[16:33.40]Hold on, I'm gonna go, uh, I'm going Soldier.
[16:37.95]No, no, no, no, no.
[16:39.71]Somebody said go combat, Engi.
[16:41.19]I will.
[16:41.67]I will go combat, Engi.
[16:45.62]Oh my god, they got us, like, spawn-trapped.
[16:52.60]We are spawn-trapped.
[17:03.35]Anybody up here?
[17:07.05]Center it down.
[17:10.39]Center it down?!
[17:14.55]How am I- Oh, it's giving me a break!
[17:17.05]I got one hit on that guy?
[17:20.53]Oh my god.
[17:21.34]I just realized something that I don't have the- I don't have the gunslinger on.
[17:26.68]I- Are you serious?
[17:29.00]Alright, well, whatever.
[17:29.92]This works.
[17:34.46]Nice.
[17:36.91]Big century, baby.
[17:42.91]Oh no.
[17:43.89]Oh no.
[17:44.65]Oh no, I have no metal.
[17:48.94]Oh, that's fine.
[17:49.46]Take it out.
[17:49.84]I don't care.
[17:52.08]What just even... What just even happened to me right there?
[17:54.44]What is going on?
[17:55.28]There's so much lag on this sermon.
[18:00.84]German, the girl I have is... Do you have any dating advice?
[18:05.44]Do I have any dating advice?
[18:06.92]Um... The only dating advice I could give is... I don't know.
[18:14.16]I'm not really the best at... Oh, I gotta take this off.
[18:19.28]I'm not really the best at dating advice, to be honest.
[18:23.32]If I had any, I would definitely give it to you.
[18:27.34]The only thing I can really say is don't pretend to be somebody you're not.
[18:31.42]Because after a while, people find out.
[18:35.45]That's pretty much the only advice I can really give.
[18:39.07]Oh, stair stab.
[18:45.68]Where did my sentry even go?
[18:47.20]What just happened?
[18:51.28]What even just happened to me?
[18:52.50]Uh, no, I am not stoned.
[18:56.82]I am not.
[18:58.60]I don't do that.
[18:59.96]Drug free up in here.
[19:03.08]Dating advice.
[19:03.98]It's a trap.
[19:15.25]We gotta get him away from the spawn.
[19:17.55]Go in the other one.
[19:18.19]My god.
[19:19.03]Rocket in the face.
[19:24.61]Wait, how did I not... No, I'm gonna die!
[19:28.09]And that's a spy.
[19:33.03]Oh yeah, I got like a dozen extra eggs here.
[19:37.49]I have two dozen eggs.
[19:38.81]No, I'm just kidding.
[19:40.33]No more eggs for me.
[19:42.47]Not unless I make a stupid bet with myself.
[19:46.71]Oh, did I make it?
[19:47.35]I made it.
[19:47.65]Alright, I made it.
[19:51.09]Made it out of the spawn door.
[19:56.27]I'll probably stream for an hour or two.
[20:03.90]Oh my god, that just scared the crap out of me.
[20:10.75]uh... yes I am playing in a window I am in a window get them off the park that puts his face x no I'm not from new jersey from boston I'm from the bean town
[20:42.98]And if you're just joining the stream, happy St.
[20:44.61]Patrick's Day.
[20:45.89]If you happen to be of Irish descent.
[20:48.51]I am of Irish descent, so... Later on, after this stream, I'm going with my family.
[20:53.83]We're going to go get some corned beef and cabbage at a restaurant.
[20:58.54]Should be a good time.
[21:00.94]Get to see some aunts and uncles I haven't seen in a little while, so... Should be cool.
[21:06.54]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[21:08.32]I can't... Oh my god!
[21:11.32]How did I survive that?
[21:13.62]Holy crap.
[21:15.60]I need, like, health.
[21:18.88]I can't believe I survived that.
[21:23.26]Come on, come on, come on.
[21:27.33]Just at least give me, like... Oh, what am I doing?
[21:31.07]My brain just, like, exploded right there.
[21:34.29]I'm trying to, like... Will I build something and just die with crits, I idiot?
[21:43.00]I just ran into a spy.
[21:43.90]At least I think I did.
[21:48.00]Are we really- are we doing this well?
[21:50.04]Over time?
[21:51.18]Yeah!
[21:53.79]I'll take that.
[21:56.63]Oh, jump over the rocket!
[21:57.69]I just rocket jumped with his rocket.
[22:01.73]Right now it is 6 p.m.
[22:04.73]Eastern Time.
[22:08.16]Do I like streaming on Twitch or YouTube?
[22:09.96]I think they both have their own little perks.
[22:14.36]For instance, I think more people can watch a Twitch livestream, because Twitch is available in more areas.
[22:23.89]Yeah, Twitch is available in more places.
[22:26.45]I think that the reason why people are having problems with this stream is YouTube streams are not available all over the place in the world.
[22:34.89]I'm pretty sure that's the problem people are having.
[22:40.95]Is there no damage spread on this server?
[22:44.06]How did I not hit him?
[22:47.38]Don't get yourself killed!
[22:48.72]Run away!
[22:53.32]Oh, come on.
[22:54.16]Oh my god.
[22:59.59]No, get that scout.
[23:02.67]Oh, what... What just... I... Oh, I thought I died from the flamethrower.
[23:13.15]Arby's corned beef.
[23:14.21]You know what?
[23:14.65]There is no Arby's around here.
[23:16.91]I wish there was an Arby's around here.
[23:18.27]I'd go there every day.
[23:20.83]Those of you that have Arby's near you, is it any good?
[23:23.94]I always see the commercials and I'm like, God, I want one of those roast beef sandwiches.
[23:31.80]Spy.
[23:33.84]Spy.
[23:35.74]Sure, why not.
[23:40.45]Mission begins in ten seconds.
[23:45.26]Oh, that's fine.
[23:45.92]That's fine with me.
[23:46.62]I'll just bump into you.
[23:49.90]I'll just bump into you.
[23:52.28]Look, I am heavy.
[23:54.31]Oh my god, that's such baloney.
[23:57.13]That is baloney.
[24:00.17]Slow-mo that back.
[24:01.31]I backstabbed him.
[24:06.69]Did we lose?
[24:08.44]What?
[24:09.97]How did it... Hold on, did you guys hear that?
[24:11.97]It just said, you fail victory.
[24:13.93]What was that?
[24:15.99]You fail victory.
[24:22.96]No, I told you!
[24:25.46]I actually hit him.
[24:27.48]Hit me with that crit rocket.
[24:32.87]Oh, get out of my way.
[24:34.87]Oh no, get out of my way.
[24:38.35]Look, I'm a heavy.
[24:41.28]Oh, sick minigun.
[24:47.43]Oh, boink.
[24:50.53]Oh, come on, get me behind all these bastards.
[24:56.85]My gloves are running urgently and I'm running wicked slow.
[25:03.00]Yeah, that's not like a total giveaway.
[25:04.48]Take you too.
[25:09.72]No, no, no more heavy disguise.
[25:12.41]Oh, this guy's eating a sandwich!
[25:13.81]No!
[25:21.35]Oh, boy.
[25:23.67]Damn it.
[25:26.23]So, Arby's really is terrible.
[25:30.57]My processor.
[25:31.37]How many gigahertz is your processor?
[25:32.97]It is 3.6 gigahertz, I believe.
[25:35.30]It's overclocked.
[25:37.10]It is an overclocked Intel i7950.
[25:39.86]Yeah, I'm a real engineer, don't worry.
[26:03.29]Oh, chaos stab!
[26:04.37]Give me a chaos stab!
[26:16.31]Yeah, I do apologize if you're getting errors on here.
[26:19.15]There's not a whole lot I can really do about it besides just not stream.
[26:22.77]Come on, back up a little bit.
[26:35.93]Damn.
[26:37.65]I got a GTX 470 NVIDIA.
[26:40.79]EVGA edition.
[26:42.89]I think that's also clocked, too.
[26:44.25]That's overclocked as well.
[26:46.77]I got a lot of overclocked stuff.
[26:53.89]It's not going to be good up here.
[27:06.70]Get away, get away, get away, get away.
[27:11.98]Talking about, like, face stabs, I still have not gotten a stair stab.
[27:15.96]Not once in the entire time I've ever played Team Fortress 2.
[27:19.60]Never gotten a... Oh my god.
[27:21.78]A stair stab.
[27:22.48]Oh, now I did!
[27:23.46]Nope.
[27:25.34]How did... There's, like, twelve people in this hallway.
[27:28.56]How did I get killed?
[27:41.21]Get that scout bastard.
[27:43.61]Oh, you're not gonna get away.
[27:44.45]Not gonna get away.
[27:52.00]Let's go, uh... I'm gonna go sniper costume.
[27:55.04]Let's go sniper costume, baby.
[28:01.66]Oh, I'm just sniping.
[28:03.16]Just sniping.
[28:03.66]Hold on, we gotta, like, be careful here.
[28:04.96]Like, let me in the spawn.
[28:06.84]Let me in, like, the spawn door.
[28:09.59]Damn it.
[28:15.80]Oh, boy.
[28:20.74]Run away, run away.
[28:30.14]Oh, no!
[28:30.94]That would have been my first stair stab ever!
[28:32.70]Hey, buddy.
[28:36.81]Damn it.
[28:37.97]That would have been my first stair stab ever.
[28:41.91]Oh, I will get one of those damn things.
[28:47.71]Damn.
[28:48.67]I... How did I not get that?
[28:51.27]I'm just gonna... I'm gonna get a stair stab.
[28:52.91]It's gonna happen.
[28:54.85]Shit.
[29:04.49]Today we're gonna go stair stabbing.
[29:08.25]I'll go heavy.
[29:08.97]We need a heavy.
[29:11.67]I'll go... Tommy Slob heavy.
[29:14.72]I got on the...
[29:16.61]Tommy Slav.
[29:18.03]What else do I got?
[29:19.79]No!
[29:21.25]Crit rocket.
[29:22.57]Damn.
[29:25.05]Yeah, after this round, we're gonna go to a new server.
[29:27.03]So, get to a new empty server.
[29:33.39]Yeah, I have... This is my heavy setup.
[29:36.91]Oh god, five seconds left.
[29:37.83]Are we, like, losing or winning?
[29:38.73]I don't even remember.
[29:39.79]Oh, looks like we're winning.
[29:43.64]Where's that guy coming from?
[29:50.23]We did it!
[29:52.99]Hooray!
[29:55.28]I'll follow you to the depths of hell.
[29:57.80]Alright, new server.
[30:04.50]The next server is going to be... refresh.
[30:11.42]Oh, stair-stab with a heavy.
[30:16.44]Okay.
[30:19.78]Let's go to... Hmm.
[30:28.17]Oh, these are 32.
[30:28.95]Here we go.
[30:29.85]Stop, refresh.
[30:31.19]Gold Rush.
[30:32.57]Control Point Kings.
[30:35.99]Looks like we're going to go here.
[30:42.28]New server.
[30:45.14]For stream.
[30:47.30]Here you go.
[30:53.68]Putting it in the chat right now.
[30:56.32]There it is.
[30:58.76]Everybody go there, if you can make it.
[31:02.93]I have not played Tribes of San Tony.
[31:06.71]I'm thinking about getting into it, thinking about trying to get into the open beta.
[31:09.31]I don't know, I just really haven't had time, to be honest.
[31:13.35]I've been doing a whole lot of TV watching lately.
[31:17.65]Plus I got that new dog, and I've been kind of busy lately, so...
[31:22.83]It's been tough to get into new games, at least the last week or so.
[31:25.59]Let's go red.
[31:40.99]Why do I... How come I keep getting defaulted to the pyro?
[31:49.77]Spray.
[32:05.30]I love that.
[32:06.48]I want to do that too.
[32:07.24]Quick!
[32:07.58]No!
[32:07.96]Too late.
[32:09.21]You know what?
[32:09.57]I'm going to play Engineer.
[32:10.37]I'm going to play real Engineer.
[32:13.35]I'm going to be a weird Engineer.
[32:14.93]A weird bastard.
[32:17.49]Put it down.
[32:19.67]What's my pain?
[32:22.87]I can see your comment.
[32:27.76]Help me build this pyro.
[32:28.72]Thanks, dude.
[32:32.88]My opinion on the very controversial subject of bread?
[32:36.33]Well, obviously bread is an incredibly, incredibly controversial subject.
[32:41.65]I think that the best kind of bread is wheat bread, but then of course the white bread will get really irritated with that, and the rye bread might rise up and take over the wheat country of Dilstalu.
[32:54.51]So I'm, you know, I like to stay pretty neutral.
[33:07.67]My brain just exploded right there.
[33:09.45]What am I doing?
[33:10.52]I thought I was on offense for a second.
[33:17.02]Where the hell is Shibby?
[33:18.68]Where is Shibby2142?
[33:20.04]Oh, he's probably working right now.
[33:22.58]He's a real working man now.
[33:26.63]Do we have six Engies?
[33:28.29]Oh my god.
[33:30.49]Oh, this is... Okay, let's do it.
[33:35.75]I'm happy with this at least.
[33:38.21]It's the least I can do.
[33:40.57]Oh my god!
[33:42.21]Oh, well, it looks like we crashed the server.
[33:45.11]Oh, don't worry everybody, we have every entrance secure.
[33:49.17]All we need is one pointing down the stairs, and you're talking about hystericalness.
[33:55.59]Oh my god, this server is laggy as hell.
[34:00.23]Oh my god.
[34:00.97]Alright, I'm moving.
[34:03.42]I'm going down here.
[34:06.34]I'm going right here.
[34:07.74]They don't even know I'm here either.
[34:11.96]Just give me the revenge crits.
[34:13.21]That's all I'm caring about right now.
[34:14.55]I'll change classes after this.
[34:18.25]Oh, that's a spy.
[34:20.13]What?
[34:20.79]What?
[34:21.47]What?
[34:22.33]What?
[34:25.11]Oh, it's because every- Oh my- Oh.
[34:27.68]My.
[34:28.42]God.
[34:29.64]Look at these pings.
[34:32.00]Look at these pings.
[34:35.11]Holy crap.
[34:40.58]Oh, well, looks like we just, like, broke this guy's server.
[34:45.90]Hey, uh, Mr.
[34:46.98]W.O.F., uh, sorry, but we broke your server.
[34:53.01]Yeah, new server.
[34:59.59]New server.
[35:00.29]Oh, God.
[35:04.32]Alright, time just to shoot people with a pistol until I die again, then I'm changing.
[35:07.08]Oh, I'm gonna go on a tirade.
[35:13.42]Yeah, new server.
[35:14.92]This place is ridiculous.
[35:16.12]How about... Hmm... What is Casbah?
[35:30.59]Do another refresh.
[35:35.88]Yeah, somebody in there had like 900 ping.
[35:38.98]Oh my god.
[35:40.97]Forget that.
[35:41.79]There we go.
[35:52.99]We might have to go into a 24 or 30.
[35:54.56]Let's see.
[35:55.88]This one's 29.
[35:56.32]We'll go to capture the flag.
[36:00.06]Well, why not?
[36:01.28]More spots.
[36:01.80]All right.
[36:05.56]This is where we're going.
[36:10.36]Dis new server.
[36:14.30]Here we are.
[36:21.95]Everyone head there.
[36:22.63]Hopefully this place doesn't like crash.
[36:30.29]Yeah, if you get in the stream error, try closing out your browser.
[36:34.32]and like clearing out like your browser history, like your cache and all that, and then try coming back in.
[36:39.92]That seems to have been working for some people.
[37:02.05]I just wrote the IP.
[37:10.68]Oh, let me write this.
[37:11.36]I don't think people can... Come on.
[37:20.44]Let's try it.
[37:30.85]I'm going to write this in the chat just because some people... There we go.
[37:40.69]There we go.
[37:44.73]Did that even go through?
[37:52.78]Oh god, this server is like no better.
[38:11.73]Yeah, I posted the IP earlier.
[38:13.21]That's a spy.
[38:16.72]I like the black box better.
[38:18.26]Personally, in my opinion.
[38:20.12]Oh my word!
[38:23.24]I just think the black box is just... I don't know.
[38:25.38]Oh, if I could buy the damn train!
[38:26.70]That was heinous.
[38:40.65]Oh, man, I've never done so many cartwheels in my life.
[38:44.63]Jeez.
[38:48.99]Give me that elf.
[38:53.28]Oh, bird of prey mode.
[38:56.94]Mmm, I'm in trouble here.
[38:59.14]Ah, damn.
[39:00.28]Mini sentry.
[39:05.09]Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[39:09.00]The enemy has dropped our intelligence.
[39:14.16]Whoa, what was that?
[39:16.22]I just heard a bunch of noise going on over there.
[39:19.56]You can't use your flames in here.
[39:24.70]Whoa.
[39:25.40]Nice dispenser.
[39:30.98]Yeah, screw that train.
[39:35.03]Now I'm not getting hit by the train again.
[39:37.01]That would have been two in a row.
[39:39.65]That would have been two trained travesties in a row.
[39:45.25]I want to kill that medic.
[39:46.07]Mmm, I'm on fire now.
[39:53.28]Get to that water.
[39:54.56]Gotta get in the water.
[39:59.04]Where'd he go?
[39:59.42]Where'd he go?
[40:00.16]Oh my god.
[40:01.88]Chaos.
[40:04.71]Oh, I'm so dead.
[40:10.14]No, I'm gonna drown!
[40:15.84]I'm making a run for it.
[40:16.86]Let's go, let's go like all the way to the back of their base.
[40:19.76]Now they got a big sentry over here.
[40:23.10]Oh, not that I can't, I can take it out.
[40:24.70]Oh!
[40:25.58]No!
[40:26.32]God, why did I crouch?
[40:29.81]What was the, why did I crouch?
[40:31.39]Oh my god.
[40:34.05]Oh, what the hell?
[40:38.27]That was... B... U... You know the rest.
[40:44.26]LL.
[40:46.70]Could've taken that thing out.
[40:58.37]Would I like to see TF3?
[40:59.49]I would love to see a TF3.
[41:01.89]I don't think it'll ever happen, though.
[41:03.77]I think they're kind of...
[41:05.29]I'm gonna stick with the community idea thing and let the community run with it, and I'm gonna die.
[41:09.03]I'll play Sniper.
[41:14.42]I'll play Sniper with the Cozy Camper.
[41:18.66]I got the Co- let's see what it looks like.
[41:19.82]Yeah, see, there it is.
[41:21.38]Cozy Camper.
[41:29.68]Are there really slot reservations here?
[41:31.89]Oh, what am I doing?
[41:33.15]Why am I running in there like that?
[41:34.37]Oh, I got the cozy camper.
[41:35.58]It doesn't even matter.
[41:36.20]I'm not going to flinch.
[41:41.62]Ugh.
[41:44.85]How am I missing this guy?
[41:50.41]Oh, how are they just running by us all?
[41:54.47]Come here, you bastard.
[42:00.75]What new items would I like to see in Team Fortress?
[42:04.03]A... What?
[42:05.33]Run!
[42:05.71]Run!
[42:06.09]No!
[42:06.75]My friend!
[42:10.63]Oh, come on.
[42:11.21]Come over here.
[42:15.95]Oh, come on!
[42:16.63]That would have been sick!
[42:21.11]No!
[42:21.41]Get that!
[42:21.79]A weapon I'd like to see in Team Fortress is a...
[42:28.31]New engineer primary that's not a shotgun.
[42:33.23]I guess they kinda already did that with the Pomsim.
[42:37.01]But it's still technically a shotgun.
[42:38.63]I'd like to see a total replacement for the shotgun.
[42:41.73]Damn.
[42:53.36]We'll protect that medic.
[42:56.62]Damn.
[42:57.57]I gotta put the... So is it true that this works, the Cozy Camper works with the Huntsman?
[43:11.46]Yeah, there's probably some bug in the YouTube streaming right now, to be honest, because this should not be double ads playing.
[43:16.90]That just should not be happening.
[43:25.68]Hold on, are you, like, stuck in an infinite add?
[43:32.86]Infinite add.
[43:42.56]Oh, watch it.
[43:46.50]Ow.
[43:51.11]So is the stream, was it in your sub boxes, guys?
[43:54.55]I'm just wondering.
[44:03.31]Oh, that was sick.
[44:08.54]Oh, lag.
[44:16.81]Maybe that's another part of the problem.
[44:18.33]I've had a couple people say that it wasn't in their subscription box.
[44:24.17]Or it should have been.
[44:28.66]Oh, too many people attacking!
[44:30.88]Oh, I don't know.
[44:31.80]I don't know what to do.
[44:32.48]Hold on, it has infinite adds?
[44:35.66]Are you serious?
[44:42.36]Oh my god.
[44:45.32]This is just a bug in the YouTube streaming, definitely.
[44:56.29]Infinite ads.
[45:00.11]Give me a break.
[45:01.19]Just reload the stream.
[45:08.87]I reload the street.
[45:17.07]Yeah, if you're getting infinite ads, if you get, like, stuck in an infinite ad, just reload the stream.
[45:23.45]YouTube.com!
[45:25.35]The best website in the world!
[45:34.60]Oof.
[45:40.04]Oh, and anybody can buy the train?
[45:42.90]Damn it.
[45:45.20]Damn it!
[45:46.88]I can't see him!
[45:48.32]The flames are blocking him.
[46:04.16]Yeah, if you're getting infinite adds, definitely just reload the stream, or just come back, because that's... that's stupid.
[46:13.35]That should absolutely not be happening.
[46:16.84]Oh, add, then add, then add.
[46:17.48]That's so dumb.
[46:34.00]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[46:38.00]Oh, that medic is standing still!
[46:41.00]I haven't- I didn't kill the medic?
[46:45.12]Who did I kill?
[46:45.74]That was weird.
[46:53.98]Oh god, oh god.
[46:55.32]No, why?
[46:56.74]Why?
[46:57.18]Oh, we buy any car.
[47:12.05]Yeah, I...
[47:14.57]Who did I just kill?
[47:15.95]Can somebody in the stream write that if you're getting, like, just reload the browser if you're getting an infinite add?
[47:23.01]Like, two or three of you say it, because the chat is quite fast.
[47:30.34]Because I wouldn't want someone just to sit there and be like, what is going on?
[47:35.16]I got crits.
[47:39.75]Get that health.
[47:45.35]No, no, no, no, get out of the range.
[47:55.69]After this round, I'm going to hop into some CSGO for a little bit.
[47:59.42]Should be interesting.
[48:07.26]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[48:12.16]Yeah, all the things you're seeing are...
[48:14.95]YouTube streaming bugs, apparently.
[48:16.89]None of this happened last time.
[48:18.79]Those of you that were here last time... I don't think I can restart the stream, that's the problem.
[48:31.76]The thing with YouTube is once you start, you have to either stop and remake an event, or you can't... I think it's weird like that.
[48:39.40]I've got a critscreen right now.
[48:41.14]Oh my god.
[48:45.07]I killed one person.
[48:57.40]Infinite adds, oh my god.
[48:59.82]Well, I guess the one possibly good thing is this thing will be watchable on YouTube.
[49:05.36]Hopefully, unless there's more bugs.
[49:13.27]When do I predict... Oh, he's going to fish kill me.
[49:15.99]No, he's going to fish kill me.
[49:17.33]He's going to fish kill me!
[49:18.43]He fish killed me.
[49:23.37]Alright, we'll go with three more deaths.
[49:35.94]And I'm going to hop on CSGO.
[49:38.51]I'll see if there's something I can do on my end.
[49:40.29]I don't think there is unless I turn off the stream and then, like, redo another live event.
[49:44.82]Which, I mean, it takes a little while to set these up on YouTube, so... YouTube bugs for the win.
[49:57.35]Damn, if I only lowered that a little bit... Ah, where are they getting these crits?
[50:06.51]What?
[50:06.99]What?
[50:07.23]Was that?
[50:08.03]No, that wasn't a medic.
[50:11.27]What was that?
[50:15.25]You're gonna be rolling that bacon, buddy.
[50:17.79]I don't think so.
[50:18.28]Maybe I'll get, like, banned.
[50:20.00]Like, they're probably gonna be like, oh, we saw that you loaded 25,000 ads to, like, you cheated.
[50:26.44]When in reality, it's just like a bug on their site.
[50:34.32]Yeah, CSGO is the new Counter-Strike.
[50:36.36]It's in beta.
[50:37.44]Alright, this is my last life.
[50:40.40]Last life, and I'm gonna hop on CSGO.
[50:41.86]Where am I going?
[50:47.34]Where is this guy going?
[50:49.60]Oh, another one!
[50:51.52]Oh, no!
[50:51.88]That didn't count.
[50:52.46]One more life.
[50:56.57]YouTube Premium.
[50:58.39]Only $30 a day.
[51:03.55]30 bucks a day.
[51:06.57]That's more money than my data plan for my phone is in a whole month.
[51:14.58]Oh, I got him to kill himself.
[51:21.30]First infinite ad, second... Wow.
[51:24.97]YouTube.
[51:26.91]Thank God for YouTube.
[51:28.39]And they're not buggy site at all.
[51:31.06]It works perfectly every single time you want to use it.
[51:35.86]How did I not hit him?
[51:40.64]Oh, alright.
[51:41.16]CS go time.
[51:46.16]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm gonna disconnect from here.
[51:49.51]Hold on a second.
[51:50.27]Let's figure this out.
[51:50.97]What the hell is going on?
[51:52.89]I'm gonna... I'm playing my own stream.
[51:56.89]Here we go.
[52:00.45]See what happens.
[52:02.21]I'm watching, okay, here's an ad.
[52:06.11]Let's see what happens after this ad.
[52:07.35]Alright, what do you got for me?
[52:13.95]You're gonna give me, like, another ad?
[52:15.61]What do you got?
[52:19.53]Oh, look, another ad!
[52:20.79]Are you serious?
[52:26.40]Wow.
[52:27.64]Alright, uh, yeah, this is, this is stupid.
[52:34.09]Oh my god, YouTube.
[52:35.87]Oh wait, it worked.
[52:40.67]Okay.
[52:42.31]I got two.
[52:45.63]Oh, thank god for YouTube.
[52:46.89]Alright, um, can I like, hold on, let me go to my video manager for a second.
[52:53.03]I'm just going to turn off all the ads now.
[52:55.26]See if I can even do that.
[52:59.74]Live event dashboard.
[53:03.64]No, the stream is in good health!
[53:05.97]Sure it is.
[53:10.25]Oh, sure it is!
[53:14.73]I don't understand.
[53:15.73]See, there's nothing... I have to turn off the stream.
[53:19.29]This is dumb.
[53:22.54]Alright, well... Your stream is in good health.
[53:30.92]Apparently not.
[53:37.98]Yeah, if you're still having the ad problem, or if you're just barely getting back from it, I apologize.
[53:42.57]That is not what was supposed to be happening.
[53:46.87]Hold on a second.
[53:48.51]See, the only thing I can do is just stop broadcasting.
[53:52.01]Which will turn off everything, and then I have to reset up a new event.
[53:59.85]Well, it should go right to YouTube.
[54:01.49]This should be uploaded to YouTube without any BS, so...
[54:06.83]I do apologize, though.
[54:14.57]Let's go to Counter-Strike GO.
[54:23.24]Oh, right.
[54:24.46]The screen's going to go black while I load up Counter-Strike GO.
[54:32.48]Counter- Global Offensive.
[54:36.86]Hold on.
[54:37.38]Bear with me for a second.
[54:41.00]Remove.
[54:42.02]Add.
[54:44.32]CSGO.
[54:47.00]Okay.
[55:00.03]So, Counter-Strike GO is...
[55:04.91]All of a sudden, 2,000 people quit the stream.
[55:07.49]I wouldn't blame them, man.
[55:08.55]That's stupid.
[55:09.11]That's annoying.
[55:10.57]If I was just sitting there wanting to watch a livestream and it was like, oh, here you go.
[55:13.74]Here's like 15 ads right next to each other in a row.
[55:17.92]I'd be pissed off, too.
[55:19.00]That's stupid.
[55:24.02]How did I get a beta key?
[55:25.30]From a really cool dude.
[55:26.82]His name, he just wants to go by Anonymous.
[55:30.40]If he's in the stream, if you're in the stream, Anonymous, then thank you so much.
[55:33.88]You are amazing.
[55:37.67]Alright.
[55:41.25]It looks like we're on... What map are we on?
[55:43.03]I've got to buy stuff.
[55:47.35]Pistols.
[55:47.87]Let's go with the... Do I have enough money for that?
[55:54.04]I do.
[55:54.30]Alright, let's do it!
[56:04.45]How much is CSGO?
[56:05.51]It's not out yet.
[56:06.67]I gotta turn, my sensitivity is way too high on this.
[56:09.55]Gonna change that.
[56:13.59]Oh, god.
[56:15.51]Oh, unsensitivity.
[56:17.59]Keyboard and mouse.
[56:18.81]Mouse sensitivity, come down.
[56:20.17]There we go.
[56:26.05]Audio.
[56:27.15]Turn the audio down.
[56:29.51]Resume.
[56:30.75]Alright, we lost.
[56:31.39]Alright, that's much better.
[56:39.86]Dual Berettas, baby.
[56:41.94]I need to start saving money.
[56:42.94]What am I doing?
[56:50.90]Click, click.
[56:53.80]The dust is dustier.
[57:02.28]Sorry, I just, like, unloaded a clip on you.
[57:04.40]Whoa, they take a long time to reload.
[57:07.97]These things take a long time to reload.
[57:14.39]Bang.
[57:16.82]Bang.
[57:17.28]I actually like these.
[57:21.96]I'm gonna keep these.
[57:22.56]Let's get a, uh... How much money do I have?
[57:27.15]Kevlar and Helmet.
[57:29.47]And... I'm gonna stick with these.
[57:31.41]I'm good with these.
[57:55.89]Long range pistol attacking.
[58:00.19]Let's get up there.
[58:05.31]Oh god!
[58:05.99]No, what am I doing?
[58:06.73]What did I just pick up?
[58:07.71]I didn't want that!
[58:09.93]What was up with that?
[58:15.27]I didn't want to pick up that weapon, that was BS.
[58:18.93]Is that the P90?
[58:20.07]Or the PPM, whatever it is?
[58:22.56]Let's watch this guy.
[58:23.18]Let's see how good this guy is.
[58:25.22]Oh, you just got smashed.
[58:29.92]You just got smashed.
[58:36.16]I think this is coming out in a couple months, maybe?
[58:39.81]I don't know.
[58:40.17]There's no release date for it yet.
[58:41.73]It's in beta.
[58:44.59]Let's go with PP.
[58:49.19]Check the PP out.
[58:52.76]If I get one car for free, I would want the most expensive car you could ever make.
[58:56.78]I would want, like, a Lamborghini, or, like, a Bentley.
[59:00.20]Give me, like, the absolute most expensive car you can buy, and then, like, then I'll just resell it.
[59:05.34]Oh, drop zone!
[59:08.54]Damn.
[59:09.08]I got one guy.
[59:09.79]I got, eh, I got one guy.
[59:10.87]Ticket.
[59:18.07]Abyss Lord.
[59:24.35]Am I, like... What's going on?
[59:25.51]Why is this guy just, like, sitting there?
[59:29.78]Is this guy camping with a deagle?
[59:37.04]How you get a copy of this is you have to go to... You have to take Valve's survey.
[59:42.48]They have, like, a CSGO survey.
[59:47.22]Oh, the FAMAS and Kevlar Helmet.
[59:52.62]I've been invited to join the group.
[59:54.24]Kills free gaming.
[59:57.90]So, is this a burst?
[59:59.62]This is a lot different than it is in Call of Duty, I'm assuming.
[60:10.85]Where is this guy?
[60:11.67]He's down there.
[60:12.67]Oh, no.
[60:14.43]No, no, no, no.
[60:15.07]Run away.
[60:15.41]Ah.

[60:51.24]I think you can do it through Steam as well.
[60:54.87]Maybe they aren't even doing it anymore.
[60:56.37]I'm not sure.
[60:56.77]If anybody knows... Where's the, uh... Is it the MP7?
[61:03.56]The one from Counter-Strike, the original, that I like?
[61:06.92]I think it might be.
[61:07.92]I forget.
[61:17.77]Oh yeah, they're not even close.
[61:19.23]Two totally different games.
[61:20.23]I'm going to go this way.
[61:20.83]I had more luck going this way before.
[61:23.99]Oh lord.
[61:29.21]I'm going to get flashed.
[61:31.59]I am going to get flashed.
[61:43.72]Damn, how did I not get that guy?
[61:45.20]Come on, that's ridiculous.
[61:47.11]That is redonkulous.
[61:49.05]I'm gonna turn my heat-seeking missile thing up.
[61:53.62]Or black screen for a second.
[61:57.80]Resume game.
[62:00.46]The beta ends probably when the game comes out.
[62:05.86]A scout asks for a dispenser.
[62:07.39]Will you give him one?
[62:09.97]Actually, the questions were kind of weird.
[62:13.31]It was like, let me ask you something.
[62:15.54]What does more damage in a round?
[62:17.64]The M4A1 or the AK-47?
[62:20.00]Which one do you think is more powerful?
[62:22.28]They ask you, like, actual real questions about it, so... That's not how I got into it, though.
[62:27.27]Somebody gave me a beta key.
[62:28.41]I'm gonna go... Let's go Terra side.
[62:36.21]Would I buy a Ferrari?
[62:38.23]If I had the money, like, to just throw away, I absolutely would.
[62:44.11]Go dual Berettas.
[62:55.18]Yeah, I need to buy a frag.
[62:56.07]What am I doing?
[63:00.23]I'm, like, not buying anything.
[63:01.33]Oh, they're behind us, too.
[63:06.07]Yikes.
[63:08.23]I'm gonna go around this way.
[63:09.19]I'm gonna surprise this bastard.
[63:12.60]Can I even go around this way?
[63:13.56]I don't think so.
[63:15.68]I would love to hear a joke.
[63:27.09]Where the hell is everybody?
[63:28.05]There's only two guys left on the team.
[63:29.29]There's one.
[63:32.59]Oh, I just totally gave myself away.
[63:35.90]Oh my god, what an idiot I am.
[63:40.62]I'm so stupid.
[63:46.82]Firing around in the air with dual pistols equals MLG Pro.
[63:52.21]Yeah, I want to buy... I want to get a rifle, man.
[63:56.60]Oh, that guy.
[63:58.24]That guy's unloaded.
[64:00.54]Oh, you're taking the survey now?
[64:01.46]Good.
[64:01.93]Good.
[64:05.25]I love potatoes.
[64:06.25]They are unbelievable.
[64:07.35]Alright, let me get a... What do we got for heavy?
[64:13.51]Nova?
[64:15.03]This thing is 5200 bucks?
[64:16.79]Oh my god.
[64:20.80]The Galil, okay.
[64:22.12]We'll take out the Galil.
[64:24.38]Nah, I want a grenade.
[64:26.14]I want a Molotov.
[64:27.02]I'm doing a Molotov right now.
[64:28.92]How do I switch to it?
[64:30.20]Is it... What is it?
[64:31.28]Three?
[64:31.92]Oh, it's four.
[64:32.38]Okay, four.
[64:32.84]I'm gonna throw it down the hall.
[64:40.21]Let's throw this down here.
[64:42.55]Molotov out!
[64:44.73]Oh, I'm so happy!
[64:47.29]Whoops.
[64:49.69]Hey, oh, I'm sorry.
[64:50.47]I just, like, totally ruined everything, teammate.
[64:52.37]I apologize for that.
[64:56.16]I thought that was a guy right there next to him.
[64:57.88]Oh my god.
[64:58.72]Oh my god, no.
[65:02.66]Ah!
[65:05.86]Mr. Cammy.
[65:06.86]I'll say your name.
[65:13.47]Counter-terrorists win.
[65:15.53]I lost all my money.
[65:19.25]Hmm.
[65:24.03]I want something with like a... This thing's got the highest fire rate, huh?
[65:28.39]None of these are that accurate.
[65:31.99]This thing, oh, it's a sniper.
[65:34.47]Oh, the AWP's back.
[65:36.77]I'll go with the Galil.
[65:37.63]I like the Galil.
[65:45.15]I need some more money.
[65:45.93]I gotta start killing people.
[65:49.26]Not like running around like an idiot.
[65:55.29]Alright, this is where the action is.
[65:57.35]Oh, my... Oh, I knew it.
[66:00.03]Why did I go around so carelessly?
[66:04.29]If I had a frag grenade, or if I had a molotov, that would have been game over.
[66:14.82]Super Taco, well, I'm glad to be your hero.
[66:18.44]If there's anything I can do to protect this country and this world, I will do it.
[66:28.92]This guy is so dead.
[66:35.01]He had the right idea right there.
[66:39.63]Leprechauns.
[66:41.35]Oh, come on, pull it off.
[66:42.27]Oh!
[66:43.29]Oh!
[66:46.13]Oh, damn.
[66:48.51]Look at that.
[66:50.47]He pulled it off.
[66:54.85]I bet you I will see that combat in The Awesome.
[66:57.46]Bet you I will.
[66:59.29]Alright, I want to go... I don't want the shotgun.
[67:04.63]Let's go with the 5.7.
[67:10.64]Kevlar.
[67:12.74]And I want a high explosive grenade.
[67:18.12]Alright.
[67:19.66]I'm not messing around anymore here.
[67:26.06]Read the word in Arabic?
[67:28.06]What word are you talking about?
[67:30.64]All right, this is the magic area.
[67:35.74]Boom.
[67:36.76]Get blown.
[67:41.32]Damn.
[67:42.26]I'm breathing.
[67:46.68]Damn.
[67:49.24]Reflexes like a cat, baby.
[67:50.86]I'll take your PM290, whatever it is.
[67:51.97]Ah.
[67:58.43]Every time I start talking, I'm like, yeah, I just get annihilated.
[68:03.73]Alright, I'm definitely buying that again.
[68:06.55]Because that's like, I did good with that.
[68:13.05]And I want... Okay, I'll take a flashbang.
[68:16.21]You can buy more than one grenade, I think.
[68:17.43]I don't know why I'm only buying one or two.
[68:22.09]Be prepared!
[68:24.47]What's that from?
[68:26.43]Fifteen Germa points, what's that from?
[68:28.79]Be prepared!
[68:33.91]Get flashed.
[68:36.93]I just flashed myself.
[68:38.51]Oh, what an imbecile.
[68:47.60]I'll take you down, too.
[68:48.66]Where you at, buddy?
[68:50.62]Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[68:57.15]MLG Glock.
[68:59.97]I like this gun.
[69:01.01]I need to start to stop being a turd and do well.
[69:07.97]And grenades.
[69:11.51]I'm going to go with another Molotov and a high explosive grenade.
[69:15.50]I'm going to have two different grenades.
[69:17.42]We'll go with the Molotov first.
[69:18.52]That's right, Lion King.
[69:23.30]Lion King, you all get it.
[69:26.47]Molotov, baby.
[69:27.45]What do you say?
[69:28.07]Let's light it up.
[69:30.03]Light it up, baby.
[69:31.67]What just happened?
[69:32.32]Oh my god, no.
[69:34.54]No.
[69:36.00]Oh god, this guy's so mad.
[69:38.58]I'm sorry.
[69:40.20]I'm so sorry.
[69:42.06]I'm so sorry.
[69:42.86]I just killed all my teammates.
[69:44.96]Oh my god.
[69:45.94]Oh.
[69:48.50]Oh.
[69:58.88]Damn it.
[70:01.82]Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[70:04.57]This guy is so mad.
[70:06.65]I have my voice turned off, but that guy is definitely screaming at me.
[70:13.17]I can guarantee you that.
[70:20.34]Is this a scope?
[70:21.76]It is.
[70:24.30]Ooh, I think I might like this thing.
[70:29.67]Alright, this time I'm not going to flashbang myself.
[70:35.71]Did we get anybody?
[70:39.34]Oh, for the love of God.
[70:42.66]Damn.
[70:46.48]Be prepared.
[70:49.70]Germo, why was there fruit punch on the floor?
[70:52.69]I don't know.
[70:53.83]People need to stop eating so much fruit punch.
[70:57.09]Well, that guy just totally... This guy, Kilroy, just killed the entire team.
[71:02.61]He legit just killed every single person.
[71:06.89]I gotta start using the SMGs.
[71:09.16]I am absolutely not one of those guys that can sit back and, like, do well by aiming.
[71:14.62]I just need to go like this.
[71:18.94]Oh, shit.
[71:21.44]This guy's so... Oh, he's a bot.
[71:23.36]Okay, never mind.
[71:23.88]He's a bot.
[71:25.84]Are these all bots?
[71:28.77]How come my team has the bots?
[71:30.05]Alright, let's go.
[71:36.45]Spray and pray, baby.
[71:46.69]Oh my god, how much does it take to kill the guy?
[71:52.19]What just happened?
[71:54.43]Where was that guy?
[71:57.84]What in the name of God?
[72:00.85]Can I really?
[72:01.31]That's pretty cool.
[72:07.21]I'm going with just straight up, I want money.
[72:10.69]So I got money.
[72:12.99]How about the shotgun?
[72:13.81]I'm gonna use the shotgun.
[72:17.51]Just because I feel like it.
[72:20.25]I did play Sea of Swords, I played 1.6.
[72:24.69]I wasn't really that good at it, though.
[72:26.89]My brother was really good.
[72:28.67]My older brother was really good at Counter-Strike.
[72:31.93]Me?
[72:32.57]Not so much.
[72:37.80]Let me get somebody to just play.
[72:39.26]Okay.
[72:39.82]I was going for a headshot.
[72:46.14]Damn it.
[72:49.80]That guy's good.
[72:51.98]It's not fair.
[72:52.56]That guy's too good at this game.
[72:56.38]I was using the shotgun.
[73:00.78]That guy Kilroy.
[73:02.48]I want to get on his team.
[73:05.86]I'm four and nine right now.
[73:07.58]Wow, I'm doing the best on this team?
[73:10.44]No way.
[73:12.46]I want to... What's the most expensive one?
[73:16.04]MP7.
[73:18.52]And grenades.
[73:20.09]High explosive grenade.
[73:21.41]And I want a Molotov.
[73:24.66]Can you put a silencer on stuff, too?
[73:26.00]Isn't that possible?
[73:29.78]Alright, this time I'm not going to light the entire team on fire, I promise.
[73:37.10]I have played some MMOs.
[73:38.20]I played World of Warcraft for so long.
[73:43.13]How am I... I can't believe I didn't kill that guy.
[73:46.23]That headshotted me.
[73:48.17]How did I not land
[73:50.64]That is ridiculous, in my opinion.
[73:53.59]Ridiculous!
[73:56.53]Unless he's, like, aimbotting.
[73:58.29]No, he's definitely not.
[74:01.55]He's just really good.
[74:05.58]I'm four and ten.
[74:06.62]Oh, if you die one more time, you need to eat an egg.
[74:17.05]I had the most success, to be totally honest, with the 5.7.
[74:23.77]Kevlar.
[74:25.22]Forget about the stupid grenades.
[74:27.08]One Molotov.
[74:27.94]Let's go.
[74:30.84]I've only killed people with this weapon.
[74:40.47]Alright, let's get some area denial down there.
[74:47.10]I didn't want this, I didn't want this!
[74:49.94]I didn't want that weapon.
[74:52.68]Dude, this guy Kilroy, seriously, is just destroying everybody.
[75:01.93]Kilroy.
[75:05.47]Look at my team and look at their team.
[75:07.57]Look at how many pros are on their team.
[75:09.67]Look at how many scrubs are on my team, including me.
[75:14.26]You got the ultimate scrub, which is me
[75:18.72]And then, like, two of those guys are, like, eight and two KDR.
[75:23.52]Alright, I'll definitely do that next time, CN.
[75:32.56]I'll take control of one of these bot bastards.
[75:37.15]Oh, God.
[75:39.51]Hey, white screen!
[75:48.71]Watch out, watch out!
[75:49.49]Get out of my way!
[75:52.58]Oh, I'm so dead.
[75:53.38]I'm going this way.
[76:00.40]Wow, we won.
[76:02.28]Cool.
[76:04.40]I shot like five people.
[76:08.67]An awesome Pro 360 controller user.
[76:11.27]I already got the Glock.
[76:17.60]No, the, uh, Fire 7, sorry.
[76:20.92]Let's do it!
[76:22.80]Oh, max out the pistol ammo!
[76:32.81]Okay, let's go.
[76:33.63]There's gonna be somebody right here, and I'm gonna get friggin' headshotted.
[76:43.57]Yeah, right here.
[76:45.65]That Kilroy, goddammit, headshot!
[76:48.83]Rage quit.
[76:50.37]I'm going to a different lobby.
[76:52.81]I'm going somewhere else.
[76:56.39]Watch me get put right into the same game.
[77:00.30]Oh, let's go right into the same game.
[77:02.14]With freaking Killjoy, the guy with 40 kills and like 3 deaths.
[77:12.51]Oof.
[77:14.93]Yeah, I gotta get my first MOAB in this game.
[77:22.43]Why am I not making commentaries about CS?
[77:24.97]I just got it.
[77:26.28]I just got it.
[77:30.54]I got CS go probably three or four days ago.
[77:33.70]All right, good, good.
[77:36.74]This is a new lobby.
[77:38.10]Oh, new map too.
[77:40.10]Very cool.
[77:43.21]New map.
[77:44.63]No, this is Italy, right?
[77:45.45]This is CS Italy.
[77:54.29]Hi, Mexican Koala.
[77:55.97]How are ya?
[77:57.49]Good to see ya.
[78:01.23]Need backup.
[78:01.95]I'm going this way.
[78:07.55]There we go.
[78:07.97]Let's clear this place out, gentlemen.
[78:15.20]Well, that's how you win.
[78:18.76]That's how you win.
[78:21.36]Alright, I got one.
[78:22.29]That's one... That's 24 away from a MOAB.
[78:32.57]Yeah, I don't know when the TF2 update's gonna come out, to be honest.
[78:35.38]I'm not sure.
[78:37.24]They've already started rolling out some changes, so... Probably in the near future.
[78:41.54]I'd say in the next...
[78:43.70]Probably in the next couple weeks, you'll probably see some more stuff in TF2.
[78:47.60]Hopefully, at least.
[78:50.28]Gonna be a bunch of people around this corner.
[78:53.32]Oh, right there!
[78:54.15]There's a guy!
[78:58.57]If only my reactions were better, and I didn't think that was a teammate.
[79:04.03]I use a Razor Death Adder.
[79:06.67]That's the mouse I use.
[79:09.43]Oh, take control of the bot!
[79:11.37]Oh, hey, what's up, hostages?
[79:19.44]Oh no, they got the hostages.
[79:21.16]What do we do?
[79:27.27]Those poor hostages.
[79:31.41]Oh, apparently my stream is just starting.
[79:33.87]That makes perfect sense.
[79:40.10]Oh, get away from me.
[79:42.72]I got one.
[79:46.84]Oh my god, look at all this fruit punch.
[79:48.48]Something happened here.
[79:50.50]He's right there.
[79:52.54]He's right there.
[79:57.07]Oh!
[79:58.81]Wayne!
[80:03.67]We lost.
[80:05.99]Oh, that's right, I got, like, my kills with them when I took control of bots.
[80:09.59]Whoops.
[80:11.79]Oh, we're gonna do some sniping.
[80:14.54]We're gonna do some straight-up, legit sniping.
[80:20.36]Oh yeah, this is gonna be sick.
[80:25.58]Hell yeah.
[80:29.32]Why did the chicken cross the road?
[80:31.90]To... Go meet his family for supper.
[80:41.47]Oh!
[80:44.13]Bastard, how am I not hitting you?
[80:52.97]Oh, quick scope.
[80:57.53]What?
[80:58.57]What?
[80:59.23]I was going to say, you're going to be, how did I miss that?
[81:04.77]That was going to be like, oh, I just die, I go walk up five feet away from you.
[81:08.82]I see this guy over here.
[81:19.44]Where is he?
[81:21.24]Oh, get dominated.
[81:26.65]Anybody else?
[81:27.31]There's two more guys.
[81:32.05]No, no, no, no, no.
[81:36.19]Shoot.
[81:40.43]Come on, come around the corner.
[81:44.03]Where's he going?
[81:45.21]That scares me.
[81:45.79]Where'd he go?
[81:49.10]Where is that... dude?
[81:54.49]Where the hell is he?
[81:56.49]Oh, it's- what?!
[81:57.25]What the hell was going- what the?!
[82:01.33]Wha- he was just sitting there?!
[82:04.39]You bot!
[82:10.08]Alright, we'll do... another two or three rounds.
[82:17.95]I wanna buy... Let's go with the PP.
[82:23.56]And I didn't buy the Kevlar, what am I thinking?
[82:26.52]Kevlar best.
[82:30.68]Oh, look at that fire rate!
[82:37.79]Yeah, well, to get a MOAB, I gotta kill more than, like, one person in a row.
[82:46.02]Two of them.
[82:47.27]Two of them.
[82:50.81]That's ridiculous.
[82:52.93]I can't believe I didn't kill him.
[82:55.09]That's ridiculous.
[82:56.89]I got a GTX 470 from Nvidia.
[82:59.21]That's the video card I got.
[83:04.03]Desert Eagle.
[83:05.95]Kevlar and helmet.
[83:08.65]And a high explosive.
[83:13.44]Oh yeah!
[83:13.70]Alright, this will probably be the last round before I end the stream, because I want to go back and look and see what was going on, see what kind of errors were happening.
[83:22.00]This will be on YouTube if you just came, if you missed the beginning.
[83:26.76]It's going... Oh, give me the whole line of people!
[83:34.23]Oh my god, I'm killing the whole line!
[83:36.85]I just killed like four people right there.
[83:39.97]Oh, look at that, ammo conservation.
[83:44.88]I was just aiming down there, aiming near heads, and I just killed everybody.
[83:48.70]But yeah, this is going to be uploaded to YouTube, so if you missed it, or if you couldn't watch it or something like that, this will be in your sub box as a watchable just straight through video.
[84:00.02]At least I hope it will.
[84:08.83]Have I used this gun yet?
[84:09.73]I don't know.
[84:10.19]I'm going to go up here.
[84:14.99]I'm gonna go up the log cabin.
[84:16.50]Oh, never mind.
[84:17.00]No, I'm not.
[84:17.92]It's too much work to do.
[84:27.30]This guy stopped talking?
[84:29.08]Listen to him.
[84:29.38]He's like, got nothing.
[84:30.28]It's clear.
[84:30.94]Hostages.
[84:31.60]Situation.
[84:32.68]Got it.
[84:33.28]Yep.
[84:34.10]Roger.
[84:38.75]Oh my... I don't even know how that... I don't even know how that happened.
[84:44.21]I don't even know how that happened.
[84:47.11]I want to watch that again.
[84:48.13]Because I had a Kevlar... I don't understand.
[84:55.76]I don't get it.
[84:58.56]I'll take control of you, buddy.
[85:01.24]Alright.
[85:02.28]Alright, hostages.
[85:04.09]Let's talk business.
[85:05.61]What do you know about the operation?
[85:07.89]Too late, you didn't ask fast enough.
[85:09.71]Answer fast enough.
[85:10.89]What about you?
[85:11.87]You like seeing your friend get shot like that?
[85:13.81]What do you know about the Organization X?
[85:16.55]Oh, I don't know, I just... I'm so scared, please just let me get... That's not the right answer.
[85:26.24]Oh, they rescued them.
[85:28.70]It's alright.
[85:31.08]How does that even...
[85:37.06]Don't ask me how that happened.
[85:38.70]I don't understand.
[85:39.24]I don't understand.
[85:41.92]Oh, this is the AUG.
[85:47.30]I didn't even see this.
[85:48.78]I used to love the AUG.
[85:56.06]The AUG.
[85:57.10]A-U-G.
[85:58.68]The OGIE.
[86:03.65]Come on, show yourself.
[86:16.20]Nothing here.
[86:19.92]Get out of my way.
[86:21.42]Get out of here.
[86:23.58]What am I doing?
[86:24.22]What are you doing?
[86:24.88]You're a bot.
[86:26.20]You listen to me.
[86:29.72]I can't kill him.
[86:34.61]Oh, look it.
[86:35.49]I'm gonna be the only one left.
[86:36.73]What's going on, random vids?
[86:45.58]I was gonna shoot the chicken.
[86:47.54]I was gonna shoot the chicken.
[86:53.00]How come these are all just bots?
[86:55.86]I just went to quick match.
[86:56.99]It's not like I said, please play with bots only.
[87:01.89]I just went into quick match.
[87:04.72]I don't understand.
[87:10.33]I- you know what?
[87:10.81]I kinda wanna just die.
[87:12.97]Ready?
[87:14.59]Oh, this is gonna be funny.
[87:18.13]Uh, do any of these- any of those guys have grenades?
[87:21.09]I hope they do.
[87:23.94]I just went so high!
[87:25.44]Alright.
[87:26.14]Let's see, uh... I want this guy- where are the hostages?
[87:32.20]Where are the hostages?! !
[87:40.64]Oh my god, the entire team is right there.
[87:48.18]Come on.
[87:49.26]Ah, damn it.
[87:50.74]All right, guys.
[87:52.14]That's enough for me.
[87:52.76]See, watch.
[87:53.10]Look, ready?
[87:53.50]Exit to main menu.
[87:54.18]I went to... I just went to quick match.
[87:58.33]Did I do quick match or create a game?
[87:59.65]I think I just did quick match.
[88:00.61]I don't know.
[88:02.99]But yeah.
[88:06.13]Thanks, everybody, for coming.
[88:08.38]If you missed it, or if you were having problems with the stream earlier, this should all be uploaded to YouTube, so you can watch the whole stream if you want from beginning to end.
[88:19.58]Thank you guys for watching, and I do apologize.
[88:21.96]I'm sorry for the shenanigans that happened earlier.
[88:27.29]I don't even know what was happening.
[88:28.61]Everyone was getting like 50 ads in a row, and that's not how it was set up.
[88:34.31]I apologize if you were having problems.
[88:36.58]But yeah, thank you guys so much.
[88:37.90]I'll talk to you guys soon.
[88:39.98]And take care, everybody.
[88:42.42]Next stream is going to be next Saturday, probably.
[88:44.59]Or, you know, I might do one during the week.
[88:47.25]I'm not sure yet.
[88:49.03]I don't know.
[88:50.33]I'm not sure.
[88:52.23]I assume that I'll probably do one, if not this coming Saturday at 6, then probably like Thursday, Wednesday, something like that, if I end up doing a midweek one.
[89:08.37]But I will check you guys soon.
[89:10.83]Thank you, everybody.
[89:11.45]Goodbye.
[89:12.89]See ya.
[89:15.16]Actually, how do I turn it off?
[89:17.08]I don't even know how to turn off my YouTube stream.
[89:20.48]Hold on.
[89:25.56]I can't stop streaming.
[89:28.60]Let me just go to YouTube.com.
[89:32.98]What if it was just locked forever?
[89:34.28]Like, oh, sorry.
[89:35.58]You're stuck on YouTube for the rest of your life.
[89:40.01]What is going on?
[89:40.59]Why can't I... Oh, I gotta open up a new tab.
[89:43.95]Here we go.
[89:44.70]Okay.
[89:50.46]Here we go.
[89:50.94]There it is!
[89:51.42]Alright, yep.
[89:53.55]Thank you, guys.
[89:54.51]See you soon.
[89:55.35]Take care, everybody.
