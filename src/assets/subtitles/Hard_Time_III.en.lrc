[01:47.04]Hey, what up?
[01:54.58]How was your Christmas?
[01:59.61]Was it good?
[02:03.67]At Christmas is old news.
[02:07.12]And I asked you that like two days ago.
[02:17.28]Now we look forward to the new year.
[02:21.17]And in doing so, some of the streams that I have promised to do.
[02:28.08]I'm gonna get you with a late Christmas present.
[02:32.26]A hard time was by the end of January.
[02:35.83]A hard time in January.
[02:38.22]It's still December.
[02:41.24]And I'm playing it today.
[02:45.54]If it's anything like the other M. Dickie games, Wrestling Empire is one of my favorite games.
[02:54.49]It's definitely in the top 250.
[03:02.29]This one's even crazier, apparently.
[03:06.10]I remember almost, I want to say 15 years ago.
[03:13.93]I remember people playing this game.
[03:17.27]This game has been around for almost two decades.
[03:20.93]Now, the one I'm playing Hard Time 3.
[03:26.38]I guess there was a two.
[03:28.27]I think MDickey had a website that he released stuff on and...
[03:32.13]Then he re-released it at...
[03:34.26]So Hard Time 3 is technically just the quintessential Hard Time.
[03:41.72]2 was a bootleg game, it was a mobile game.
[03:59.91]But this has been one of the most requested games to play.
[04:02.66]Apparently it's crazy, so I'm going to check it out.
[04:06.32]I'm not going to guarantee you I'm going to play this for six to seven hours.
[04:11.82]I'm going to give this a couple hours and we'll see.
[04:23.40]But this is one of those games that was like, dude, when are you gonna play Hard Time?
[04:27.30]When are you gonna play this?
[04:29.49]I'm like, I don't know.
[04:30.54]We'll do it now.
[04:31.24]And I'm like, I'm not doing it now.
[04:32.07]I'll do it next week.
[04:33.11]And it's been next week for about three years.
[04:36.23]So, here we are.
[04:42.55]I'm so excited.
[04:43.20]I love this game.
[04:47.49]Alright, well, we'll see.
[04:48.40]I'm going into it completely blind.
[04:55.43]And then after this, if I want to play this for a few hours or a couple hours or whatever it is, there's other things that I could do today.
[05:01.99]Or maybe I'll just, hey, guess what?
[05:04.03]I'm going to be live.
[05:06.11]for the very minimum, like 25 minutes, one more time.
[05:11.92]I want to hit the even 100.
[05:14.90]This is my 99th stream this year.
[05:16.92]I don't care if I go live for literally five seconds.
[05:20.32]I'm going to get to 100 streams.
[05:24.98]I was made aware of that, and I'm like, I'm doing it.
[05:33.01]Alright, here we go.
[05:36.37]Turn the stream off and on right now.
[05:43.40]Is the bird game on the board today?
[05:45.88]I don't know what that could be like a thousand different games.
[05:53.26]Alright, here we go.
[05:55.15]Also, I'm gonna be taking more frequent breaks.
[05:58.25]I'm not necessarily going to...
[06:01.39]I don't know.
[06:01.79]We've talked about putting the ads back on to take breaks with...
[06:06.47]But I'm not necessarily doing that today, but in the future I might actually start doing that again.
[06:16.68]latter incontinence well I mean it's that but it is helpful to be forced to get up every hour
[06:27.40]Let's see.
[06:30.59]Bird Game 3.
[06:31.70]Bird Game 3.
[06:36.83]It's called Angry Birds.
[06:38.12]Oh, my God.
[06:39.56]Alright.
[06:39.80]Hard time three.
[06:40.51]Let's go.
[06:40.95]We're going in.
[06:45.47]Here's your first Christmas present.
[06:54.09]Alright, do I make a prisoner?
[06:55.62]I did start it for a second just to make sure I could capture it.
[07:03.90]Does it matter where I go?
[07:04.84]There's North Block, East Block, South Block.
[07:13.25]Does this matter?
[07:19.54]Can I make my own prisoner?
[07:27.54]Yes, I can.
[07:28.43]How do I do that?
[07:32.72]Wait, I think I can pick somebody.
[07:34.97]Is it like Wrestling Empire?
[07:37.37]Just pick one?
[07:38.11]Okay.
[07:41.44]How about this guy?
[07:44.47]And then, okay, here we go.
[07:48.48]Okay, I'll be, what should my name be?
[07:54.71]How about Mr. Crime?
[08:07.69]That's a stupid name?
[08:09.43]Whatever.
[08:14.78]John Criminal.
[08:19.77]But if I'm Mr. Crime, if I commit crimes, then it's okay, whatever.
[08:26.69]Can I add like a thing on top so it's like French or something?
[08:30.67]Like Mr. Creamy.
[08:33.70]Can I do that?
[08:34.23]How do I do that?
[08:40.69]I'm keeping Mr. Crime, I don't care.
[08:44.41]I can't change any of this.
[08:47.32]Okay, costume.
[08:53.79]Okay.
[08:54.33]20 different hairstyles.
[08:57.54]Let's go with a... Should I just be bald?
[09:05.90]I kinda like this one.
[09:07.94]I'm not gonna lie.
[09:11.24]Keep these eyebrows?
[09:19.94]Bald is the best?
[09:22.03]Hold on.
[09:22.57]I actually, I kind of like this one.
[09:25.50]But we'll see.
[09:26.06]I think it's going to be this one.
[09:31.01]This reminds me of every other WWF wrestler from like 2000 to 2007.
[09:42.66]Variation.
[09:43.94]Oh, you can have it be the actual half.
[09:48.33]Extensions.
[09:51.53]Hmm.
[09:53.92]I don't think so.
[10:02.47]With a high ponytail?
[10:04.72]You could do pigtails.
[10:07.92]Alright, how about this for the bun?
[10:09.16]Alright, I think the bun is gonna, brings it all together for me.
[10:17.23]Mm.
[10:23.51]That's the one for sure.
[10:24.52]Uh, shave?
[10:29.33]How about a light shave on there?
[10:31.30]That looks good.
[10:32.56]Wait, how about just a regular haircut underneath this?
[10:37.50]Yeah.
[10:39.59]This is like a hairpiece.
[10:40.43]Yeah, I like that.
[10:44.45]Okay, what about the color?
[10:51.24]Should we get like red?
[10:52.71]No.
[10:53.07]No.
[10:57.82]Is this how you're gonna cut your hair?
[10:59.25]You know, I actually thought about doing something crazy.
[11:12.40]Let's go with like a gray.
[11:19.44]Alright, that's good.
[11:21.28]Alright, so now... Is that all I can do for my costume?
[11:27.12]Oh, here we go.
[11:27.54]Alright, face.
[11:36.51]I like that one.
[11:39.19]Alright.
[11:40.46]16 or...
[11:48.17]16, 26, 27 has completely jumped over every single other one.
[12:00.63]Uh, hold on, wait.
[12:02.09]30 is good too.
[12:03.16]33 is good.
[12:08.03]Half of these are good.
[12:12.32]I'm staying with this one.
[12:21.13]How about that?
[12:25.59]This needs to be gray.
[12:38.24]How do you make gray?
[12:41.62]Gray is void of color.
[12:51.98]Nah, that's too jokey.
[12:55.46]Nah, way too jokey.
[13:05.09]There we go.
[13:06.62]Less green.
[13:08.73]Good.
[13:12.26]Okay.
[13:12.38]What about masks?
[13:15.06]You can wear a mask?
[13:17.26]Did he just port every single mask from Wrestling Empire over here?
[13:25.07]It's like, well, I have the assets, I might as well just use them.
[13:32.14]Oh my god.
[13:33.31]Uh, no.
[13:33.63]No masks.
[13:34.98]No eyewear.
[13:35.66]How about glasses?
[13:40.60]You can wear a crown?
[13:41.76]The Gandalf hat?
[13:52.37]Why would you...
[13:57.21]I can wear a neck brace?
[13:58.24]I think I'm going to have a neck brace on the whole time.
[14:13.13]This really is just every asset from Wrestling Empire.
[14:15.66]This one's kind of snazzy though.
[14:33.16]Either that or wear the Gandalf hat.
[14:38.52]Can you take it off eventually?
[14:39.54]Head shape.
[14:44.99]Again, I'm a big jaw guy.
[14:46.21]I'm a big chin guy.
[14:49.90]That's the thing.
[14:50.61]I'm always going to be the big chin character creator guy and there's nothing you can do to stop me.
[14:57.78]I'm annoyed at myself that I do it almost every time.
[15:02.09]But there's nothing that gets me more than that.
[15:06.05]like that one too though hold on wait I like this one's good too never mind
[15:16.82]Okay, my demeanor is aggressive or...
[15:20.98]I kind of like the idea of being 5% friendly.
[15:27.23]Is that even friendly?
[15:29.12]That means you are 95% you don't really care at all.
[15:33.42]I think 5% friendly is funny.
[15:39.82]Okay.
[15:43.37]Can I have a baggy body?
[15:45.40]Yeah, baggy.
[15:48.35]That's fine.
[15:50.67]Okay, so how do I want to wear this?
[16:01.57]You can wear a jersey?
[16:03.54]I like the overalls.
[16:11.14]I'm gonna- Oh wait!
[16:12.34]Wrestling Empire!
[16:13.49]We're an ad for a different video game.
[16:15.47]That's funny.
[16:18.91]Do I have tattoos of this on me?
[16:33.55]Is that an American flag?
[16:35.80]Oh god, I'm not even wearing it.
[16:37.59]I don't hate that.
[16:49.21]Okay, I like the football pads.
[16:56.09]Oh, that's the under pattern.
[16:57.74]Okay, I'm gonna wear football pads.
[17:00.48]And...
[17:10.15]They're like a waist brace.
[17:13.58]What color do I want these?
[17:23.41]I like something dark.
[17:31.29]Blue?
[17:39.73]You look swag as hell.
[17:44.03]I mean, I look like I'm about to go to like, I don't know, like a 4th of July party or like a New Year's Eve party.
[17:52.50]I just need sparklers in my hands.
[17:55.27]Alright, that's fine.
[17:56.28]Collar?
[18:01.40]It has a bow on it.
[18:02.56]Alright, that's fine.

[19:08.80]Okay, I can change my reputation.
[19:10.23]75 in everything?
[19:16.73]I think I want...
[19:18.00]I don't care about my reputation, right?
[19:20.81]We definitely want more stamina and agility.
[19:31.73]Is that good?
[19:35.46]Do max strength?

[19:55.34]Alright, I think we're good.
[19:56.76]Do I really need to do all the moves?
[19:58.23]I don't think we're going to do all the moves.
[20:08.67]What's the special underhook DDT?
[20:10.52]That's fine.
[20:13.15]Wait, at least we got to see the specials, right?
[20:14.84]What's my...
[20:19.82]In the world where every prisoner is a professional wrestler.
[20:25.09]That's not bad.
[20:25.76]I like that one.
[20:27.81]How about throat toss?
[20:29.59]No.
[20:38.89]That's brutal.
[20:47.50]I don't even need to see any other move.
[20:55.89]Okay.
[20:57.55]Stats.
[20:58.35]Moves.
[20:58.71]Costume.
[20:59.19]Uh...

[21:03.87]Where do I do that?
[21:04.43]Wait, I can do my age.
[21:19.12]okay I think that's fine
[21:33.11]Four foot six is too small.
[21:34.44]It's going to break the game.
[21:35.18]How about like five?
[21:36.29]How about five feet tall?
[21:40.70]Gandalf the Dwarf.
[21:50.54]Alright, where do I change my crime?
[21:52.15]Oh, this is my civilian outfit.
[21:56.27]I'm gonna make this real quick, hold on.
[22:07.86]That's fine.
[22:16.40]Yeah, can I change what my crime is?
[22:19.05]I don't think so.
[22:23.45]I think I'm ready to go.
[22:34.45]Alright, I'm ready.
[22:37.71]Mr. Crime, this court has seen you accused of bribery.
[22:44.59]I find you guilty and sentence you to serve 22 days in prison.
[22:52.54]That may not be a long time, but it will be a hard time.
[22:55.55]You'll be lucky if you survive.
[22:59.19]That's a judge?
[23:00.60]Officer Monaco, get this animal out of my sight.
[23:03.58]I never want to see him here again.
[23:09.23]Who are all these people?

[24:17.34]You're gonna give me the gun?

[24:24.74]What?

[27:55.53]Okay, should I go to the hospital?
[27:58.52]Deliver a revolver to Doug Turner by five o'clock.
[28:10.69]This one doesn't open.
[28:11.57]Maybe it has to be a certain time of day.
[28:16.05]Alright, I'm gonna go to the hospital.
[28:17.04]Let's see, can I get like a, somebody help me?
[28:18.46]Can I get healed?

[28:27.18]What are you talking about?
[28:28.01]Why does he have a crossbow?
[28:36.10]I need to eat this stuff.
[28:37.03]Wait, wait, wait.
[28:37.90]I gotta get the eat.
[28:38.48]I have to eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[28:44.35]We'll see what the judge has to say about this?
[28:51.83]What?
[28:54.44]This court has convened to hear the case against Mr. Crime.
[28:57.28]Why is it a Canadian Mountie?
[29:01.78]as the arresting officer perhaps you could explain why we're here officer hodge
[29:09.18]Mr. Grime was caught with a revolver which is strictly prohibited for prisoners.
[29:17.09]I found that revolver and was on my way to report it when Officer Hodge grabbed me.
[29:24.85]After hearing what you have to say and reviewing the evidence, this court rules in favor of... Mr. Crime.
[29:33.89]Thank you.
[29:36.73]The important thing is that we retrieved the revolver before any serious harm was done.
[29:45.77]He's not happy about that.
[29:48.39]Okay.
[29:49.42]So...
[29:51.19]But now I can't deliver the...
[29:53.44]I don't have a quest anymore.
[29:54.50]Let me go back to... Can I sleep in my cell?
[30:08.26]Okay, it's not fair.
[30:09.58]This guy is sto- look at this.
[30:11.91]This guy is storing something.
[30:13.60]Is it a hair dryer?
[30:19.56]Did I just reload the hair driver like it was a machine gun?
[30:31.51]Did I just die?
[30:32.35]Did I kill myself with a hairdryer?
[30:36.32]Did I shoot myself in the head with a hairdryer?
[30:43.54]Is that how it ends?
[30:45.96]Excuse me?
[30:52.43]Oh, no, no, why did that happen?
[30:55.90]Alright, I'm going to bed.
[31:01.29]Okay, this is how you get, uh, health.
[31:06.19]Oh my god, I'm glad I did that.
[31:16.87]You guys can fight up there.
[31:17.71]I don't care.
[31:24.75]Who's chanting bullshit?
[31:29.31]Uh-huh.
[31:38.08]Alright, how do I make friends?
[31:41.05]Can you open this?
[31:42.08]Can you open this?
[31:53.44]I guess I could play with the ball.
[32:03.36]Can I play catch with people?
[32:06.07]No!
[32:06.75]Can somebody get my ball?
[32:23.58]Am I actually pissing into this?
[32:26.87]You can have a prison baby in this game with an on-screen birth.
[32:30.98]Wait, Officer Enrico is wanted for murder?
[32:35.56]What am I supposed to do about that?
[32:39.07]I just hear gunshots.
[32:40.22]How do I get out?
[32:50.88]I have to be in here for an hour?
[32:52.17]How come everybody else is out?
[32:54.58]No, that's my ball.
[32:55.20]Give me that ball.
[32:57.11]Give me that ball.
[32:57.67]Hey.
[32:59.10]Hey, over here.
[33:00.99]How do you can I talk?
[33:09.95]Hey, at least I'm not losing any health.
[33:11.57]I'll sleep for like the last 30 minutes.
[33:21.31]There is a talk button.
[33:22.47]Do you even know what it is?
[33:27.72]Open!
[33:31.63]That guy's...
[33:32.06]I'm getting that ball back from that guy.
[33:33.28]He's stealing property from me.
[33:35.94]You have to make gestures at them, okay?
[33:42.08]That's my property!
[33:51.19]Give that back!
[33:54.38]Give me back that baseball, Mr. Crimer.
[33:56.13]I'll show you what it's for.
[33:59.82]No, it's mine.
[34:00.58]It was mine to begin with, actually.
[34:04.30]Well, I hope it's worth it.
[34:09.45]What's your problem?
[34:10.32]Don't touch me!
[34:14.23]That's my ball.
[34:16.61]It's always been my ball.
[34:21.79]I'm keeping my shit in here.
[34:26.16]Okay.
[34:27.59]So it's a new day.
[34:28.45]I kind of understanding what's going on.
[34:34.54]Can I pick this guy up?
[34:36.59]Is this guy alright?
[34:37.88]Wait, that guy's dead.
[34:39.47]Oh, that guy's dead.
[34:40.07]Okay.
[34:40.65]Can I... Oh my god, I didn't want to do that.
[34:42.66]I wanted to pick him up.
[34:48.11]Am I... Am I carrying around a guy's dead body?
[34:50.43]Am I?
[35:00.34]Okay, you can pick him up.
[35:02.99]Alright, hey, can we talk?
[35:04.88]Do you have anything you want me to do?
[35:08.15]Um, can I have- let me have that.
[35:14.98]I'm not gonna get in trouble firing that.
[35:17.55]You go ahead and you do it.
[35:19.15]It's not gonna be me though.
[35:21.46]I do want to see what happens when somebody does that.
[35:27.07]This is a flamethrower.
[35:29.38]Alright, I'm not getting into trouble today.
[35:31.73]I want to go explore.
[35:32.97]So let's look at the map.
[35:35.62]Okay, I can go to the hall.
[35:37.45]Let me go to the... the cafe.
[35:38.90]It blows a hole in the wall and you can escape.
[35:46.05]Really?
[35:49.82]I'm wanted for theft now.
[35:58.38]I'm supposed to arrest you for theft!
[36:02.45]But since I'm so merciful, I could be persuaded to overlook it for $60!
[36:07.68]Okay, okay, here, take the $60.
[36:09.28]Let me go.
[36:09.96]Here.
[36:10.91]Thanks for your generous donation.
[36:13.12]I can't even remember who I was supposed to arrest you for.
[36:24.74]How do I get out?
[36:25.60]How do I get out?
[36:26.32]I have to prison break now.
[36:27.21]I have to prison break.
[36:29.72]It's the only way.
[36:30.27]It's the only way.
[36:31.81]I aggroed the entire prison.
[36:35.54]We can get out.
[36:48.60]Your time is up.
[36:49.20]You failed.
[36:50.24]Dude, I got arrested for it.
[36:54.61]That's the last time I ask you for a favor.
[36:56.29]Don't expect anything from me.
[36:59.28]Malcolm's stain has been found unconscious and will be recovering in the hospital.
[37:03.25]Okay, why do I, alright.
[37:08.98]Does anybody have any information?
[37:10.33]I don't know.
[37:11.14]I feel like I might have info.
[37:13.29]Everybody like stomped on him.
[37:25.94]I actually can't believe I'm not in trouble.
[37:27.98]I want to go to the hospital though.
[37:32.02]Okay.
[37:32.84]Put this down, because I stole that, and I don't want anyone to see that I stole that.
[37:35.71]Eat this food.
[37:37.25]Would you like this orange?
[37:38.18]Uh, I would have if you didn't throw it at me.
[37:44.12]Yes, thank you.
[37:48.55]You're welcome to it, Mr. Crime.
[37:49.66]That's what friends are for.
[37:50.66]Alright, Dr. Stanton is a friend of mine.
[37:52.85]Can I give him presents and stuff?
[37:57.04]How do I eat the orange?
[37:58.31]There we go.
[38:02.36]Alright, what if I give you this corn?
[38:03.68]Oh, I just shook his hand.
[38:09.18]You better stay away from me, Mr. Crime.
[38:10.72]Real criminals like me are in here for treason.
[38:13.53]Wait, isn't this the guy that was recovering in the hospital?
[38:20.65]I just saw a bed in the hotel, if that's what you're looking for.
[38:25.65]This guy does not look safe to be around.
[38:30.03]We can steal his handshake and hang out.
[38:36.13]Is there something you want to say to me, Mr. Crime?
[38:38.33]Yes, I'd like to be friends.
[38:43.84]Can you prescribe pain killers?
[38:48.34]For just $16, I could hook you up with some painkillers that will replenish your health.
[38:53.58]That's kind of a lot.
[38:55.82]Uh, no, I just need some rest, I think.
[38:58.75]How do I say no?
[39:02.97]That's your choice, but how do you intend to compete with people who are using this stuff?
[39:09.80]That's true.
[39:13.17]I wanted to grab the corn.
[39:16.03]I don't want any trouble with someone who's willing to use a bazooka.
[39:23.34]Here, take it back.
[39:25.01]You're faster than me, Mr. Crime.
[39:26.39]I don't want any trouble with you.
[39:27.44]That's right.
[39:29.45]Quit fucking around.
[39:31.47]I thought you were a real criminal.
[39:41.87]You don't want to mess with me.
[39:43.25]Okay.
[39:43.47]Now he's going to watch.
[39:44.32]Now he's going to start talking shit.
[39:50.61]Uh, or not.
[39:52.00]Okay.
[40:00.26]Is he telling me to leave?
[40:02.49]What is this guy doing?
[40:06.66]Okay, I'm gonna take something.
[40:08.17]I'm gonna carry this with me.
[40:09.31]Let's go this way.
[40:12.23]Can't go that way.
[40:13.03]Alright, where else can I go?
[40:13.92]Uh, Station, South Block.
[40:17.72]Let's go to South Block.
[40:19.55]Or, Courtroom?
[40:33.41]Alright, south block.
[40:36.67]Anything going on here?
[40:38.78]Anybody got a quest for me or anything?
[40:42.08]What about you?
[40:43.75]Spit roast.
[40:49.99]Is that guy sleeping standing up?
[40:55.50]There are too many things happening right now in self-blog.
[40:57.43]Wait, this guy wants some condom.
[41:02.26]You want anything?
[41:03.41]Is there something you want to say to me?
[41:04.53]Yes.
[41:06.56]Give me some rumors.
[41:11.85]Uh, would you like this table leg?
[41:17.51]Alright, I'll take that table leg off your hands.
[41:19.57]Thanks for thinking of me, Mr. Crime.
[41:24.08]You're welcome.
[41:31.30]I'm glad they moved me to cell seven off the south of the south block.
[41:39.05]Okay.
[41:43.44]We like to switch things up every now and then.
[41:45.34]So now you're in cell two of the self block.
[41:50.10]Oh.
[41:52.08]Okay.
[41:54.47]So I'm, I'm...
[41:56.11]Wait, I gotta get my ball.
[41:58.70]I love how the Joker is in here.
[42:11.20]Something you wanna say to me, Mr. Crime?
[42:19.32]Can you protect me?
[42:22.82]Got your back, Mr. Crime.
[42:23.87]I'll go wherever you go for a while.
[42:25.46]Alright.
[42:26.31]We have a good backup now.
[42:36.76]Should I be friends with the Joker?
[42:39.34]Alright, this is the Jester.
[42:52.41]Somebody got a hot dog in the toilet.
[42:55.16]Score.
[43:03.49]Who else has stuff I can just take?
[43:09.14]I think I want this.
[43:10.63]Yeah, I'll keep the knife.
[43:13.30]Oh wait, what's that?
[43:13.98]Is that a brick?
[43:16.49]What am I doing?
[43:18.37]Can I climb out?
[43:20.18]Watch there be a hole behind the clock.
[43:27.81]Okay, it is a brick.
[43:28.91]I want it.
[43:36.23]Oh, come on, dude.
[43:42.41]Alright, well, this is my, what was it, two?
[43:49.73]I think it's almost time for lights out, right?
[44:04.41]Is this what people do when they shit?
[44:13.98]Come on, Mr. Crime, didn't you hear the buzzer?
[44:15.77]Go and find something productive to do.
[44:17.75]Isn't it time to go to bed?
[44:18.60]I thought that was the go-to-bed buzzer.
[44:22.11]Hey, come on!
[44:23.82]Come on!
[44:30.30]Wake up, Mr. Crime!
[44:31.21]You can't sleep during the day!
[44:35.48]Why not?
[44:36.22]No, I'm sleeping.
[44:44.78]Well, if you insist on sleeping then I'll just have to give you a nightmare!
[44:47.53]Okay.
[44:58.18]Sorry if I'm staring at you, but I've never seen somebody go to the toilet while fully clothed.
[45:02.91]What is this guy doing?
[45:03.81]This guy in the cell with me.
[45:15.47]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[45:29.58]Dude, he's got a key.
[45:30.39]He's got like the master key.
[45:43.50]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[45:47.93]Okay, I will have a key.
[45:49.28]I have literally the key to everything.
[45:52.61]Oh my god, I'm in the police station.
[45:54.91]Should I crouch?
[45:57.50]Am I bad for being in here?
[45:58.60]Oh fuck, hold on.
[45:59.39]There's gotta be something I can take, right?
[46:03.57]Can I just run out?
[46:04.55]I can run out the door.
[46:06.77]Oh my god, this is the fucking entrance!
[46:11.13]Get out of the way!
[46:12.01]Get out of the way!
[46:14.99]What the fuck?
[46:15.69]Give me the bike!
[46:19.19]Get on the bike!
[46:20.72]Get on the bike!
[46:22.02]Get on- why are there wolves?
[46:24.44]Get on the bike!
[46:32.07]Go go go go go go go!
[46:39.56]Holy shit, there's a whole world out here!
[46:49.94]What do I do?
[47:00.91]I- okay, should I go in the entrance?
[47:02.49]No, where are the things are there to do?
[47:05.32]Studio, cinema, arc- I can go to- I'm gonna go to the arcade so bad.
[47:09.24]I'm gonna go to the arcade.
[47:12.87]Wait, let's go to the bar.
[47:25.22]Oh, I just smoked a cigarette again!
[47:27.93]Since you're so keen on exploring, let me show you the courtroom!
[47:33.01]I just wanted to smoke a cigarette!
[47:36.26]This court has convened to hear the case against Mr. Crime.
[47:41.98]As the arresting officer, perhaps you could explain why we are here.
[47:45.02]General genocide.
[47:50.25]Mr. Crime has no intention of serving his sentence properly.
[47:52.75]We caught him trying to escape.
[47:57.20]I wasn't trying to escape, I was trying to find my way back to my cell and got lost.
[48:00.91]What the fuck is going on?
[48:06.25]After corroborating this with the testimony of officer Bentley, this quote, wait, it wasn't an officer.
[48:11.39]Wait, what?
[48:14.72]Did they change his name?
[48:17.87]Mr. Crime, the only way to escape from prison is to serve your sentence.
[48:24.74]I hope you take this ordeal as a warning so that we never have to see you back here again.
[48:28.42]The whole system is rigged.
[48:33.30]Yeah.
[48:38.11]I think I'm gonna shit my pants.
[48:40.90]Seems we'll be sharing a cell, Mr. Crime.
[48:42.85]Let's try to get along to make this as easy as possible.
[48:50.73]Okay.
[49:00.65]Should we like... talk?
[49:02.30]I don't know.
[49:07.32]Can we be like friends?
[49:15.72]Do I have to sleep on the floor?
[49:17.61]Oh, I do sleep on the toilet, so it's fine.
[49:21.67]I'm alright sleeping on the toilet.
[49:22.75]That's fine with me.
[49:23.31]Wait, I should get some rest.
[49:24.12]Some actual rest, though.
[49:37.98]Alright.
[49:38.99]Let's go.
[49:40.33]I can't believe there's an entire world out there.
[49:48.32]Handcuffs?
[49:49.09]Is that what those are?
[49:52.30]Alright.
[49:52.58]I want to... Let me see.
[49:53.34]What else is there, Jewel?
[49:55.16]There's the hall, the hospital.
[49:57.06]Maybe I should go to, I'm going to go to the yard.
[50:09.23]You can earn money in the cafe.
[50:15.24]I can't believe they moved me to cell four of the south block.
[50:18.63]They do that frequently, don't they?
[50:25.38]Okay, cafe.
[50:27.23]Attention, Emile Tequila has been released after serving his sentence.
[50:31.60]Oh.
[50:33.19]Why are we doing like a moment of silence?
[50:35.34]We wish him the best of luck in the outside world so that others can follow his example.
[50:42.00]Okay.
[50:46.51]By the way, escaping from prison, running over a guy with a bike, and resisting arrest after escaping is worth one day in prison.
[50:55.22]I only had one a day was added, that's it.
[50:59.46]Can I play the guitar?
[51:04.51]You're getting a nice sound out of that guitar, Mr. Crime.
[51:06.71]Keep it up.
[51:15.03]My reputation is going to go up for this, right?
[51:19.29]Something you want to say to me, Mr. Crime?
[51:22.00]How about... No, you're good.
[51:28.39]Never mind.
[51:31.65]Stop gesturing to other people then because it sends the wrong message.
[51:34.36]What are you talking about?
[51:35.23]I'm playing the guitar.
[51:37.42]You know what?
[51:37.95]Fuck you.
[51:39.91]Back up.
[51:50.97]How do I get rid of, okay, I want to unequip the guitar.
[52:01.27]Eat the, eat.
[52:08.14]How do I unequip the guitar?
[52:14.19]I'm holding too many things.
[52:19.76]There we go.
[52:21.02]Holy shit, there's so much food in here.
[52:29.94]I just saw a desk in the courtroom.
[52:31.39]If that's what you're looking for, why would I be looking for a desk?
[52:37.99]That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard anybody say.
[52:40.53]I appreciate the help, though.
[52:44.59]Alright, how do I...
[52:48.14]I want to work.
[52:57.24]Hope you found my support useful, Mr. Crime, but I need to take care of something on my own.
[53:00.62]Wait, he's been following me this whole time?
[53:02.68]He's been following me the whole time.
[53:19.38]That's right, he was your bodyguard.
[53:20.77]That's right.
[53:23.52]I think I'm gonna level up.
[53:26.24]I'm getting kind of close.
[53:31.06]Um... What just happened?
[53:37.58]That thing just shattered on me.
[53:44.78]You ate too much and you puked.
[53:46.38]Well, why is this helping?
[53:51.00]You're allergic to it.
[54:00.91]Alright, buddy, get out of here.
[54:02.59]Wait, we should talk.
[54:09.01]Jack Union.
[54:12.43]No, I want to talk to you.
[54:14.00]We should plan something.
[54:19.63]We gotta figure out how to get out of here, the three of us.
[54:27.07]I don't think these two like each other.
[54:28.17]Yeah, let's talk.
[54:32.70]I do have something I want to say.
[54:39.06]Can you protect me?
[54:40.01]$12 to protect me.
[54:46.11]Well, we didn't agree to that until...
[54:47.34]Okay, whatever.
[54:55.70]That was... okay.
[54:56.89]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good!
[55:01.39]Let's go to the yard.
[55:08.00]Anybody want to fuck around?
[55:09.93]Hmm?
[55:11.04]Wait, hold on a second.
[55:12.65]Are you serious?
[55:16.59]I'm gonna be like every neighborhood dog.
[55:23.12]Dig a hole here to go to the other side of the fence.
[55:27.76]Why are there horses running around?
[55:35.88]Can you ride a horse?
[55:40.39]The guy with the ride is just a horse, man.
[55:45.94]What the fuck?!
[55:54.65]Jesus!
[55:56.15]Go back in!
[55:57.99]Go back in the hole!
[55:59.06]Go back in, go back in!
[56:03.87]Where the hell am I?
[56:06.53]Ah, yeah.
[56:08.39]Took a wrong turn in Albuquerque.
[56:10.12]And she was like, I just got out of, I escaped.
[56:12.21]Again.
[56:12.47]What's in the present?
[56:17.73]An omega key, again.
[56:19.34]What else is in here?
[56:23.52]Oh my god, wait.
[56:24.23]Is this the doctor's office?
[56:25.45]Is this his house?
[56:29.43]Okay.
[56:32.22]God damn it.
[56:37.00]I'm sorry.
[56:37.80]I'm sorry.
[56:38.38]I'm sorry.
[56:45.71]I don't want any trouble with someone who's willing to hit me with a weight.
[56:47.89]Alright, well don't tell on me.
[56:57.83]What the fuck?
[57:09.98]That officer just like killed like three people.
[57:15.05]What the fuck dude?
[57:18.40]Mr. Graham has no intention of serving a sentence if we caught him escaping.
[57:21.51]Whoa.
[57:25.24]You did an illegal cartwheel.
[57:27.81]I was trying to find... That actually was accurate.
[57:30.32]I actually was trying to find my way back to my cell and I got lost.
[57:33.34]That is...
[57:34.02]Even though I was escaping, I did... That's accurate.
[57:41.20]Yes, thank you very much, of course.
[57:44.25]I dug a hole.
[57:45.00]I was trying to make a joke to everybody else in the yard.
[57:50.11]If Mr. Crime escaped, then he wouldn't be here.
[57:53.42]That is unbelievably funny literal logic of like a four-year-old.
[58:05.66]Alright, well that was crazy.
[58:07.18]Hold on, I want to go back out to the yard.
[58:08.70]Let me sleep first.
[58:17.02]The hole might still just be there.
[58:28.09]What do you guys want?
[58:32.75]What do you want?
[58:33.19]Get it.
[58:33.68]Oh, come on.
[58:41.54]They didn't even know.
[58:42.12]They didn't add a single day because I was innocent.
[58:47.36]What the hell is going on?
[58:52.48]I guess we share an intimate moment together.
[58:57.58]I guess.
[59:07.21]Something you wanted to say to me?
[59:12.94]Uh... Can I join funny business?
[59:17.41]What does that mean?
[59:18.06]Is that code for something?
[59:20.88]Sorry, you don't have what it takes.
[59:22.10]Just try to stay out of our business.
[59:23.57]What the heck?
[59:25.97]What?
[59:31.91]Did I mean nothing to you?
[59:47.66]You don't think we can make this work?
[59:55.96]What the f-
[60:06.56]She didn't wake up.
[60:11.55]the toilet.
[60:13.08]Oh, I'm sorry.
[60:13.88]I didn't mean to break the toilet.
[60:16.06]I was just trying to get off the bed.
[60:17.56]No!
[60:20.73]Oh yeah, I got a ripple.
[60:24.97]What am I doing?
[60:28.96]Is that the funny business?
[60:31.53]Can I fix the toilet?
[60:38.05]Okay, there we go.
[60:46.15]This is fucking weird now.
[60:48.38]I don't like how weird this got.
[60:50.33]This got really weird in five seconds.
[61:02.08]How do I sleep on the ground?
[61:05.29]Get the fuck out of here.
[61:08.61]How do I sleep on the ground?
[61:12.61]Mr.
[61:13.07]Creep.
[61:13.57]No, I'm trying to sleep.
[61:15.64]And the camera just did an insane cinematography of me being a fucking weirdo.
[61:23.39]Sleep on the toilet, you cuck.
[61:27.77]Fine.
[61:35.47]Mr. Graham, how would you like to buy this table for $10?
[61:37.74]A table piece?
[61:40.44]Really?
[61:41.83]I'll gladly accept a piece of a table for $10.
[61:44.79]It was a pleasure doing business with you.
[61:45.96]Let you know if I... Oh, give it to me.
[61:47.26]Thank you.
[61:54.88]But where is it?
[61:57.99]Can you open this door?
[62:02.25]You can't keep me in here.
[62:04.66]You can't keep me in here.
[62:08.93]If I just harden my hands and muscles, I'll be able to get out of here.
[62:12.27]Oh, I think I broke my hand.
[62:20.65]Are we cool?
[62:24.90]Are we cool?
[62:30.58]It's hard to tell if we're cool or not.
[62:35.09]That does not look cool.
[62:44.39]Watch who you mess with, Mr. Crime.
[62:45.77]Harry Horn has my back and he'll break yours.
[62:48.10]You punched me in the face five times!
[62:52.64]We cool?
[62:55.15]What do you want?
[62:57.53]Take a picture, it'll last longer.
[63:05.58]Get him!
[63:06.89]Take it easy, Mr. Crime.
[63:07.64]I don't want any trouble with you and spit roast.
[63:10.19]That's right.
[63:10.84]Don't fuck with me.
[63:24.64]No!
[63:25.22]No!
[63:26.97]Oh my god, he's got a bayonet!
[63:29.27]Is this World War I?
[63:33.61]I gotta get to the yard.
[63:38.40]This camera!
[63:39.02]Change the camera!
[63:54.66]There's a new judge every single time.
[64:01.44]What did I even do wrong?
[64:03.31]A man was taunting me in front of the cell and he previously hit me in the face before.
[64:10.52]That's not even true.
[64:12.03]That's absolutely untrue.
[64:13.74]False statement leading.
[64:16.39]The wardens are always starting fights.
[64:17.74]They only ever complain when they lose.
[64:19.75]Thank you.
[64:31.46]That's bullshit.
[64:34.01]Bullshit.
[64:39.55]Now that was the warden.
[64:41.05]Well, what is he doing?
[64:43.06]Standing inside of another person's body.
[64:47.86]Bullshit!
[64:48.06]Bullshit!
[64:48.26]Bullshit!
[64:48.48]Bullshit!
[64:48.72]That's right.
[64:49.07]Everybody say it.
[64:55.68]Now I'm just locked in here.
[65:08.45]Gonna think about life for a little bit.
[65:16.64]Yeah.
[65:18.66]We'll just sleep.
[65:21.90]Well, I don't have to share a cell anymore.
[65:23.13]That's good.
[65:28.40]I don't get to come out?
[65:30.95]Like ever?
[65:37.02]I don't get to come out ever, apparently.
[65:49.24]I'll just chill.
[65:59.08]Karma finally caught up to you, Mr. Crime.
[66:00.83]Perhaps now you'll think twice about your behavior.
[66:05.07]Who is...
[66:05.74]Okay.
[66:08.17]That's fine.
[66:08.60]I'm just meditating.
[66:09.81]You can say whatever you want.
[66:11.18]It doesn't hurt me at all.
[66:16.76]This can be a dangerous place on your own, but I can shadow you if you pay me $8.
[66:22.88]Money is a construct.
[66:27.34]You can take your made-up paper.
[66:31.44]Lead the way.
[66:32.02]I'm in here, so come in here and open the cell.
[66:43.24]Yeah, I want to go in this cell, so come in this cell.
[66:50.71]You have to open the cell, though.
[66:51.68]It's not enough to see you lose, Mr. Crime.
[66:53.65]This doesn't end until you pay the ultimate price.
[66:57.56]And the person saying that is the guy with a shotgun in his hands.
[67:00.78]And it's the warden.
[67:02.08]And I think he's going to kill me with a crossbow.
[67:05.15]Like right now.
[67:06.91]I'm glad they moved me to cell five of the cell flock.
[67:13.35]Good for you.
[67:16.65]Why don't you open those doors, Warden?
[67:21.27]It's fine, you can have that crossbow.
[67:22.76]You can even load it too.
[67:25.56]Hey warden, load the crossbow, have somebody else open the door while you stand 20 feet back and open them and let me come at you.
[67:34.94]Go ahead.
[67:36.15]Open it.
[67:37.33]Since we're such good friends, I need you to do me a favor.
[67:38.92]I can't move.
[67:40.38]Your financial situation makes me embarrassed to be seen with you.
[67:44.26]Well, you took my last $8.
[67:47.14]She's running.
[67:48.03]You better save up $10 by four o'clock or it'll cost you a lot more.
[67:51.92]I can't do anything if I'm locked in a cell.
[67:56.36]What am I supposed to do?
[67:59.20]Sell my pee to people?
[68:00.45]What do you want me to do?
[68:09.67]Oh, somebody else is coming over here.
[68:11.76]It's Condom again.
[68:14.78]What's up?
[68:20.07]I could sell the hat?
[68:21.52]No, that's my whole identity.
[68:31.66]Can I like dig my hands down?
[68:34.99]Wait a minute.
[68:38.81]No, fuck you!
[68:39.86]I'm trying to...
[68:40.93]I'm trying to get out of the bars!
[68:43.72]Can I climb through this?
[68:54.61]My spine.
[68:57.48]Alright, we're in lockdown.
[68:58.44]Everybody else, run away.
[68:59.61]I guess I'm just gonna sleep again.
[69:08.55]475 pounds, you're not fitting through those bars, that's true.
[69:15.60]Huh?
[69:22.30]Punch your cell door?
[69:23.32]I was doing that.
[69:24.01]It didn't work.
[69:34.40]Hey.
[69:35.53]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[69:36.15]That person's shaking.
[69:37.20]That person's door is shaking.
[69:39.01]How did they do that?
[69:42.79]It's hard to sleep when you're still so full of energy.
[69:44.82]Spend some time to... Yeah, but I need to get out.
[69:51.56]Remember, you're on a mission to save $10 by 4.
[70:00.54]Well, let me out and let me make some... Oh!
[70:10.75]I don't care, give me, give me!
[70:13.57]No, don't throw it, pick it back up!
[70:35.27]Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[70:37.22]Go, go, go, go.
[70:39.30]Go out the door.
[70:45.14]That guy's got a fucking machine gun.
[70:46.47]No!
[70:51.44]God damn it!
[70:58.64]Okay, I cartwheeled into it and it opened.
[71:08.44]Mr. Graham was caught firing a crossbow.
[71:10.37]That's why... Oh my God.
[71:12.48]It's because I shot that guy in the chest with a crossbow.
[71:14.47]I didn't even hurt him.
[71:16.33]I was simply trying to hand in that crossbow when it accidentally went off in my hand.
[71:29.89]With me.
[71:31.38]Yeah, we're good.
[71:33.05]Alright, do I get out of solitary confinement?
[71:38.50]Mr. Crime never would have had a crossbow if you were doing your job, Officer Hodge.
[71:42.38]That's right.
[71:44.53]Dickhead.
[71:48.71]Let's go.
[71:49.27]New lease on life here.
[71:51.74]Perfect.
[71:55.23]The hell was that?
[72:00.10]Uh oh.
[72:02.03]Uh...
[72:10.22]What is he doing?
[72:11.23]He's not gonna start shooting, right?
[72:13.47]I don't think the Joker should have a gun.
[72:19.08]Haha.
[72:19.75]Oh.
[72:20.89]Haha.
[72:23.23]You're in there.
[72:29.02]No, don't- I need to make money.
[72:32.42]I need to make money and I need to chill.
[72:34.27]I can't get in any more trouble.
[72:41.73]Let's go east block.
[72:49.83]What is this?
[72:50.21]Is this food?
[72:52.09]Oh no, this is bullets.
[72:54.11]We can play with the ball.
[72:55.72]Anyone want to play?
[72:59.16]I failed.
[73:00.47]Come on, Mr. Crime, didn't you hear the buzzer?
[73:02.20]You need to get back to the south block.
[73:03.73]Oh, shit.
[73:15.72]Hey, Joker.
[73:18.38]If you're good at something, never do it for free.
[73:28.22]Okay.
[73:32.48]Spit- Where's- Oh, come on!
[73:39.31]Where's the Joker?
[73:39.92]Where's the Joker?
[73:40.47]Where's the Joker?
[73:55.68]That's the guy I'm looking for!
[74:06.49]How did I not get him?
[74:12.11]I literally swung at the guy four times with a chainsaw and it didn't connect once?
[74:18.85]What am I even in here for?
[74:19.87]Mr. Crime seems to have a problem with authority and refuses to follow orders.
[74:33.46]Officer Hodge is a control freak.
[74:34.97]Nothing I do is ever good enough for him.
[74:37.20]That's true.
[74:38.32]I think it's going to be in my favor again.
[74:48.24]Yeah.
[74:49.10]Yeah.
[74:49.43]I mean, they're just way too heavy-handed with it all.
[74:53.60]None of us should be in here wasting time over such a petty dispute.
[74:58.21]Hey, that officer told me they would give me $8 and protect me.
[75:02.76]We're going to talk about that one?
[75:05.68]Innocent.
[75:17.15]Alright, I'm going to go out to the yard and I'm actually going to do something today.
[75:29.47]Oh, there he is.
[75:30.17]I have my opportunity right now.
[75:32.16]I could get rid of the Joker.
[75:34.33]Yeah, these two are in cahoots.
[75:43.64]Yeah, guess what?
[75:45.27]Literally one day ago, she was banking out with me in that cell over there, just so you know.
[75:53.19]I never thought I'd say this, but I have to admit you have made some good points, Mr. Crime.
[75:57.74]Oh.
[76:00.35]Now that I understand your side a little better, I want you to know I don't hold anything against you.
[76:05.05]Alright, Hodge.
[76:08.43]Alright.
[76:09.92]Let's go.
[76:15.86]Don't forget who's... Don't forget who Big Dog is in here.
[76:17.93]Don't forget who the Big Dog is.
[76:25.76]Alright, I'm going to the yard.
[76:26.67]I have to pee.
[76:42.74]Come on!
[76:45.39]Why are they shooting me?
[76:47.99]Because I peed?
[77:03.44]I heard you pissed yourself.
[77:04.45]Yeah, I sure did.
[77:09.19]Come on, get me out of here!
[77:14.31]Oh shit, reversal!
[77:29.80]Stay away from me!
[77:31.85]Get away from me!
[77:37.25]What the fuck are you doing?
[77:38.80]Get up!
[77:45.38]Who?
[77:45.60]Is this the military?
[77:46.66]Since you need potty training, let me take you somewhere more private.
[77:52.25]This is gonna be in my favor again.
[77:55.40]I peed my pants.
[77:57.41]That's not a crime.
[77:58.50]It's not a crime to pee your pants.
[78:01.17]And this judge is going to understand.
[78:06.52]As the arresting officer, why did you arrest me?
[78:10.53]Because I peed my pants.
[78:13.81]Mr. Crime urinated all over the self-block instead of going to the toilet.
[78:17.13]Okay.
[78:21.52]You think I wanted to do that?
[78:22.75]I was caught short and had nowhere else to go.
[78:24.52]Urinating is not, peeing in your pants is not a crime.
[78:30.64]It just is what it is.
[78:36.64]Thank you.
[78:37.93]We've got some pretty, these judges have been great the last three times.
[78:41.86]Needing the toilet isn't a crime.
[78:43.59]Nobody made this much fuss when you soiled yourself.
[78:46.56]Yeah, you shit your pants like a month ago.
[78:50.41]There we go.
[78:54.18]Alright.
[78:55.56]I'm going to spend as much time as...
[78:57.01]I'm not going to hurt anybody.
[78:58.05]I'm not going to pee my pants.
[78:59.15]I'm not...
[78:59.41]I mean, but that was stupid.
[79:00.42]Peeing your pants is not a crime.
[79:02.42]Look.
[79:08.47]What?
[79:10.40]Are you gonna arrest me for peeing into the toilet now?
[79:13.04]Is that unsanitary behavior or something?
[79:14.75]What do you want?
[79:18.66]I need to go to sleep.
[79:24.58]What cell is mine?
[79:25.37]My actual cell?
[79:26.09]I don't even remember.
[79:34.14]Two.
[79:36.72]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[79:43.81]Fuck!
[79:46.02]I don't want to be on this horse.
[79:47.93]How do I get off?
[79:54.34]Maybe I can get out.
[79:54.97]Maybe this is my chance to get out of here.
[80:07.18]Get me out.
[80:07.62]Come on.
[80:12.10]Can you jump the fence?
[80:19.38]Come on, jump the fence!
[80:25.11]Come on!
[80:27.54]Come on, Bessie!
[80:33.37]Didn't you hear the buzzer?
[80:34.19]You need to get back into the block.
[80:40.96]God damn it.
[80:43.63]Wait a minute, it's just you out here.
[80:48.65]I don't know how to get off the horse, though.
[80:49.99]Like, honestly, unironically, I don't know how to get off.
[81:02.46]Get off the horse.
[81:03.04]Hold on.
[81:03.59]Hold on.
[81:03.85]I have to do this.
[81:04.35]I'm sorry.
[81:07.54]I'm sorry.
[81:08.94]It needs to be done.
[81:11.47]Please, horse, get out of the way.
[81:20.96]Oh my god!
[81:38.17]We good?
[81:39.40]I think we're good.
[81:42.10]Guys?
[81:46.54]We're back, we're fresh.
[81:49.02]Everybody back?
[81:53.56]Did we miss the bazooka blast?
[81:55.64]No.
[81:56.87]There's no ammo in the bazooka.
[81:58.93]I tried to fire it ten times.
[82:00.40]It clicked, clicked, clicked, clicked.
[82:02.24]He walked away.
[82:03.55]And I got out.
[82:09.73]Get up!
[82:15.70]As you may have suspected, it was my testimony that got you in trouble for your insubordination.
[82:20.71]I won't hesitate to report you again, so watch your back, Mr. Crime.
[82:24.79]Oh.
[82:28.49]I have to pee!
[82:30.53]Get on the motorcycle, it's way better than a bike!
[82:50.77]I just pissed my pants.
[82:53.37]I pissed my pants.
[82:54.22]No, put this down.
[82:57.27]Why are we all cold?
[83:03.49]I'm killing this guy right now.
[83:10.39]Alright, one-on-one, then nobody here.
[83:12.55]One-on-one, you versus me, let's go.
[83:14.24]You wanna fuck around?
[83:29.65]Get up, get up, get up, come on.
[83:31.41]Help me.
[83:42.39]Oh my god!
[83:51.73]Ha ha ha ha!
[83:57.89]Oh my god!
[83:59.48]What happened?
[84:02.91]I didn't want to hit the horse.
[84:05.24]Why did the horse run into the way?
[84:07.42]Why did the horse run into the way?
[84:10.96]Oh my god, what- I'm in the s- What?
[84:20.54]That's the guy!
[84:21.06]That's the guy!
[84:25.19]I'm not gonna get on a plane!
[84:26.55]I'm going to fucking Mexico!
[84:32.62]No!
[84:33.10]Not right at the plane!
[84:34.03]I'm at the plane!
[84:34.91]No, no, no, no!
[84:40.36]I gotta get on the plane!
[84:44.52]I can't move.
[84:47.88]I can't move.
[84:49.90]The car is running me over.
[84:51.41]How do you get run over by a parked car?
[84:53.42]Oh, my God, please.
[84:55.09]Come on.
[84:56.45]Come on.
[84:56.91]It's right there.
[84:58.48]Get up and get in the plane and go to Canada or something!
[85:03.76]Open!
[85:13.41]I can't go up there.
[85:15.84]I need a key.
[85:23.53]Can I hide?
[85:24.06]No, bad camera, bad camera, bad camera.
[85:30.62]I need money.
[85:31.45]There's gotta be money sitting around somewhere, right?
[85:41.02]You need $25 or $50 to get on the plane.
[85:43.80]Oh, come on.
[85:45.79]Is there money on the ground anywhere?
[85:56.68]What about the iPad?
[85:57.26]Can I get a ticket on the iPad?
[86:04.20]Can I make money with the iPad?
[86:13.54]I got a backpack now.
[86:18.98]Do a crypto scam on the iPad.
[86:22.65]10 seconds!
[86:27.51]Hey!
[86:28.25]It's me!
[86:29.25]It's one of the- I just made a new coin!
[86:30.42]Break out of prisoner coin!
[86:31.62]Ow!
[86:38.70]Get off me!
[86:43.05]I promise.
[86:43.71]I was going to say, I promise I won't rug pull it in 10 seconds.
[86:46.56]It's killing me.
[86:52.08]Give me the iPad, quick.
[86:53.87]Sell everything.
[86:54.86]Mark and sell all currency.
[86:57.31]Uh-oh.
[86:57.86]I'm dead.
[87:14.71]No.
[87:16.88]Alright.
[87:17.75]I'm not messing around this time.
[87:18.94]I'm making a huge guy.
[87:28.63]We're doing all strength.
[87:34.95]Who cares about reputation?
[87:36.13]It's meaningless.
[87:39.60]strength and agility.
[87:57.96]We're bringing out Mii strong.
[88:08.94]That's fine.
[88:09.77]Let's go.
[88:13.00]Eight feet tall.
[88:18.29]29.
[88:18.49]Alright, moves.
[88:20.97]I want just like a punch in face.
[88:30.90]Attack up, hip toss, DDT.
[88:41.60]Powerbomb is good.
[88:46.88]There we go.
[88:47.41]Yeah, that.
[88:48.55]I won't just punch in face hard.
[88:53.16]Running, I want...
[88:54.74]Spear is good.
[88:57.90]Pick up and then down, I want... No, we want something insane.
[89:04.19]This is a good... No.
[89:14.67]Yeah, just punches.
[89:19.17]Headbutt.
[89:23.87]Definitely this one too.
[89:24.62]This is when you hold them in the air to taunt them.
[89:36.27]That's good too.
[89:39.17]What about just regular?
[89:39.86]I think maybe regular punches are just regular punches.
[89:43.92]Okay, that looks good.
[89:44.90]We need to make prisoner outfit hair.
[89:56.02]I can't see his hair.
[90:12.59]Okay that's fine.
[90:21.01]That's fine.
[90:29.93]I need something messier.
[90:37.14]Uh, that's fine.
[90:40.35]That's fine.
[90:47.49]Okay, now we need to do the body.
[91:02.37]Should I just have no shirt on?
[91:05.68]Yeah, we're going no shirt.
[91:18.42]Why do I have sleeves?
[91:37.13]Um...
[91:38.94]Okay, well.
[91:40.67]I guess that's just the way it is.
[91:44.22]Flesh needs to be none.
[91:47.81]I have like green skin now?
[91:55.95]This is my skin!
[92:01.45]Okay, whatever.
[92:02.38]I guess he's gonna be green?
[92:13.82]Just make him the Hulk.
[92:17.46]That's fine.
[92:18.24]I don't know how to get rid of the, uh...
[92:20.84]This part.
[92:22.12]Oh, here we go.
[92:22.67]The arms.
[92:23.35]That's what it is.
[92:25.96]None.
[92:26.79]Flesh?
[92:27.41]One.
[92:27.79]Yeah, okay.
[92:34.45]So I gotta fix this then.
[92:35.74]How do I go back to the d- what's the default?
[92:51.23]Okay, there we go.
[92:54.43]Alright.
[92:59.11]Civilian clothes.
[93:00.01]That looks good.
[93:07.08]I haven't worn like four shirts.
[93:12.34]Okay, I'm ready.
[93:26.19]Alright, let's move.
[93:31.90]Be strong.
[93:32.36]This court has seen you accused of trolling.
[93:35.64]Time to go to prison.
[93:39.05]Find you guilty, 22 days in prison.
[93:47.12]Oh my goodness.
[93:51.26]Did you ever swallow something wrong and it makes you sneeze?
[93:53.09]Because that's about to happen.
[93:59.77]Oh, goodness.
[94:04.07]Attention, Mr. Crime has been found unconscious and will be recovering in the hospital.
[94:08.75]Huh?
[94:11.62]While we're investigating the incident, we ask anybody with a...
[94:13.71]Wait, I thought he was dead.
[94:25.88]Okay, well...
[94:30.23]I'm glad they moved me to cell four.
[94:32.66]What cell am I in?
[94:34.77]I don't give a shit what you fucking have to say.
[94:39.92]You're now known as Prisoner 16.
[94:46.43]Okay.
[94:50.19]This place is only as bad as you make it?
[94:53.16]Yep, yep, yep.
[94:59.78]Alright, 16's up top.
[95:01.73]What are you doing?
[95:04.58]Give me that.
[95:04.89]Is that an orange or a peach?
[95:06.77]You think I'm sharing my cell with you?
[95:08.32]Then you better get used to sleeping on the floor.
[95:10.10]This guy, I'm gonna kick the shit out of this guy.
[95:13.72]First chance I get.
[95:25.72]It's like a hidden pizza behind this?
[95:34.12]I'm at 99 stats in strength.
[95:37.66]That would be a huge mistake.
[95:40.11]By the way, I want this too.
[95:44.25]Because this is kind of the oh shit button, right?
[95:47.28]Here we go.
[95:47.79]This is my salvator.
[95:49.78]This is mine.
[95:55.96]What do you got, food?
[95:56.96]I'll be taking that.
[96:05.21]What's up, Hodge?
[96:07.74]Sup?
[96:10.90]You know how badly I want to just grab him and throw him over the edge?
[96:16.34]Okay, something I can do to keep myself busy.
[96:17.79]What do you got?
[96:21.68]I need a phone call.
[96:22.78]Could you answer it by 17?
[96:25.15]Where is the phone?
[96:28.73]Where's his telephone?
[96:31.98]Where's the phone?
[96:34.25]The office?
[96:35.99]Just down here in the main area?
[96:51.01]That guy's got a bag of jewels.
[96:57.81]What can you do with a battery?
[97:06.24]That's a huge weapon to get right now.
[97:10.79]But I don't want to get in trouble.
[97:20.18]He's looking for a phone down here.
[97:22.46]He said 17, right?
[97:23.61]1700?
[97:35.44]Oh, I'm trying to eat.
[97:36.06]I thought it was an apple.
[97:38.14]Anybody want to play?
[97:39.79]Want to play catch?
[97:45.22]What an idiot.
[97:46.39]Let's play catch.
[97:50.10]What do you want, Dundee?
[97:53.41]By 17.
[97:54.01]Oh, okay.
[97:55.16]I don't see if... Maybe I should go somewhere else.
[97:56.71]I don't see a phone anywhere.
[98:05.58]Cigarette on the ground.
[98:15.46]What the fuck was in that cigarette?
[98:23.31]It's currently fashionable to have hairstyle 11, but unfashionable to have a nervous breakdown.
[98:31.61]Anyone who fails to conform risks harming their popularity.
[98:34.96]I...
[98:35.67]I...
[98:36.07]I don't care what you have to say.
[98:37.73]Leave me alone.
[98:39.28]Okay, buddy.
[98:41.60]What is in here?
[98:49.72]Are there like gems in here?
[98:54.83]What the hell is going on?
[98:57.73]Is there fire?
[99:00.28]Where's the- where's there fire?
[99:11.61]Okay, maybe the phone's in here.
[99:18.49]I'm just chillin', I'm not gonna fight anybody.
[99:27.32]I don't see a phone.
[99:30.68]Oh, wait, right here.
[99:31.40]Okay.
[99:34.07]Can I play the piano?
[99:52.55]Phantom of the Opera.
[100:07.01]This is a demented piano.
[100:11.26]Okay, what about this?
[100:18.70]Hello?
[100:21.44]Hello?
[100:21.96]What the fuck?
[100:26.22]Where's the phone?
[100:31.73]Hello?
[100:32.17]This is an... Where's the other phone?
[100:37.30]There's another... What do you mean, other phone?
[100:39.23]Oh, come on!
[100:43.21]Hello?
[100:47.20]There's four phones.
[100:49.73]What the fuck, dude?
[100:52.04]I didn't know there were four telephones.
[100:55.33]Will any of them still work?
[101:07.64]Shit!
[101:13.83]Well, I tried
[101:19.12]You only have one earbud in?
[101:20.34]Yeah, I do.
[101:22.07]I just thought it was any phone.
[101:23.28]I thought it was like, that was the phone.
[101:28.19]I need to eat or something.
[101:37.07]Cost a dollar to eat.
[101:43.04]Okay, how many times, what do you mean I failed?
[101:45.00]Whatever, I know.
[101:46.23]Tell me the phone next time.
[101:55.95]It was at 17.
[101:57.28]I thought it was any time before.
[101:58.52]I thought you guys said it was any time before 17.
[102:01.25]Like, as of 17.
[102:02.48]I thought I failed it.
[102:07.63]It's at 17.
[102:08.88]Well, I was trolled by chat members.
[102:15.90]I said I failed it.
[102:18.30]It did say by 17.
[102:19.39]Well, that's why I thought I filled it.
[102:22.18]Who said you could steal the thumbtacks from my cell?
[102:24.67]I don't know what you're talking about.
[102:26.26]Because I did not actually pick up any thumbtacks at all.
[102:41.80]Alright, I still have 96 bucks.
[102:45.68]Would you be willing to sell that cue for $6?
[102:47.67]Ah, yes, I would absolutely love to sell you this.
[102:51.71]Take it.
[102:53.78]Go ahead.
[102:55.93]Thank you for doing business.
[103:00.77]Where are I in the positive now?
[103:02.09]I'm two bucks positive.
[103:04.77]That's unheard of.
[103:09.23]I don't like that you're walking over here like that.
[103:11.46]So, cut it out.
[103:16.23]Okay, do I get to see my family?
[103:23.11]Your time is up and it looks like you failed to do as I asked.
[103:26.21]Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
[103:30.23]If you're not interested in reducing your sentence, then we might as well increase it.
[103:33.45]Because I didn't answer your phone call.
[103:35.91]Are you kidding me?
[103:39.25]You gave me an extra day on my sentence.
[103:40.69]Where's my family?
[103:42.50]It's just a bunch of cops in here.
[103:43.79]Where is my son?
[104:03.65]Can I break the glass?
[104:11.48]Who are you visiting right now?
[104:16.17]Can one of you talk to me?
[104:17.02]Can we just have like a conversation or something through the wall?
[104:27.47]How's it going?
[104:30.02]Something you want to ask me?
[104:31.02]Yeah, we should be friends.
[104:36.04]Can you protect me?
[104:39.15]I shit my pants.
[104:40.13]I haven't got time to follow you around.
[104:41.38]I shit my pants in front of this person.
[104:46.03]I just gave her the finger and then flipped her off.
[104:52.75]Apparently I'm wanted for defecating.
[104:55.11]I'm gonna stay right here.
[104:57.41]Oh my god!
[105:07.37]What happened?
[105:16.14]I did not resist.
[105:18.57]I stood there and again, I shit my pants.
[105:21.56]So they started shooting me.
[105:28.43]They're gonna give me the same leniency that they did before.
[105:33.55]Defecated all over the police station instead of going to the toilet.
[105:35.88]Yeah, that is bullshit.
[105:38.79]I sat on a old Hershey's bar.
[105:41.02]It's been there since Halloween.
[105:45.64]I sat right on it.
[105:46.52]It was melted and it melted all into my underwear.
[105:56.22]Are you gonna be kidding me?
[105:57.88]Alright, what's the verdict here then?
[106:00.57]Whenever you need the toilet, you should try to find one before it's too late.
[106:04.60]Thanks a lot, dude.
[106:07.58]Hope you take this ordeal as a warning so that... Stop laughing.
[106:28.94]Where can I go?
[106:29.60]Well, I'm gonna sleep.
[106:50.54]Wait, this is the guy that's in my cell.
[106:51.85]That guy doesn't like me, does he?
[106:53.63]Didn't he talk a bunch of shit earlier?
[107:01.61]Do you want to be friends or am I going to have to beat you up?
[107:13.36]No one's even here to see me do this!
[107:24.07]Hey, you want this bazooka?
[107:27.21]Sorry, I wouldn't know what to do with a bazooka.
[107:28.78]Find somebody else to take it.
[107:48.39]No, I don't wanna shoot that way.
[108:01.38]You're faster than me, Meestrong.
[108:02.79]I don't want any trouble with you.
[108:03.79]Then that's why you don't talk shit when we get in here.
[108:07.08]Oh!
[108:10.23]Yeah!
[108:13.55]Come on!
[108:16.42]Oh, Officer Locke, is that you down there?
[108:18.13]Eat shit!
[108:35.69]I have to pee again.
[108:37.02]This guy pees too much.
[108:47.60]Get outta here, you fuckin' Zoomer iPad baby!
[108:50.08]Ow!
[108:53.05]Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that.
[108:56.06]I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it.
[108:58.25]I didn't mean it.
[108:58.92]Cocomelon's a good show.
[109:10.08]Ah.
[109:19.53]You'll be scarred for life.
[109:26.14]Bill Duggan injured himself in my presence and has no right to blame it on me.
[109:29.49]Those bazooka missiles fired themselves.
[109:35.92]In fact, it wasn't even in my cell in the first place.
[109:40.64]Oh.
[109:46.46]Do you have any remorse for what you did to Bill Duggan?
[109:49.21]28 days now.
[109:55.54]How are you supposed to ever play this game without just going insane every day?
[110:04.15]It's too fun to just like poop your pants.
[110:07.22]But I'm not even trying to do that.
[110:09.03]Hey, thanks for taking care of Bill Duggan.
[110:10.84]It's about time somebody taught him a lesson.
[110:12.31]Alright.
[110:15.86]That's right.
[110:16.42]Okay, cool.
[110:17.21]So should we like, we're okay.
[110:18.74]We're good.
[110:20.36]We're buddies.
[110:23.47]Okay.
[110:24.05]I gotta do, I'm gonna follow this guy around and help him do whatever he's doing.
[110:30.37]Everybody knows what you did to Bill Duggan.
[110:32.16]I'll make sure you suffer the same fate.
[110:35.42]See, somebody just walks up to you and says they're gonna, like, kick the shit out of you.
[110:38.61]So should I not...
[110:39.82]If I... Is this a...
[110:42.30]Look, me and you gotta be buddies, right?
[110:44.29]Did you know that Essa Carrera is the most agile prisoner in the city?
[110:49.42]I didn't.
[110:51.04]Why do you even know that?
[110:52.20]Why are you even telling... Why are you telling me that?
[110:57.13]I heard you pissed yourself, MeStrong.
[110:59.06]I tried to do it in the toilet next time.
[111:00.77]You're three... You're like three or four days late on that, by the way.
[111:10.06]Get with the program.
[111:10.81]I shit myself last night.
[111:22.84]Okay, so that's...
[111:23.44]I'm just saying thumbs down.
[111:24.75]Maybe it's right to...
[111:27.13]Okay, I had nothing.
[111:28.09]I did nothing.
[111:29.35]I did absolutely nothing.
[111:30.32]I'm not doing...
[111:30.88]I'm gonna not press any buttons.
[111:32.96]I didn't do anything.
[111:37.77]I did nothing.
[111:39.27]I'm not doing anything.
[111:41.18]Hey, there we go.
[111:41.82]There's my buddy.
[111:43.51]Get him.
[111:43.83]Get him.
[111:44.49]Get him.
[111:44.95]We both can get arrested again.
[111:46.94]Get him.
[111:51.89]Oh, now you're in fucking big trouble here.
[111:59.34]You gotta be kidding me.
[112:05.51]Woo!
[112:06.61]Woo!
[112:14.25]He attacked me.
[112:21.00]You took his iPad.
[112:22.34]I was trying to just reciprocate the fight.
[112:31.31]I wasn't trying to steal that tablet.
[112:32.66]I was simply taking back what belongs to me.
[112:35.17]Oh, that's bad.
[112:35.86]Just say he punched you in the face.
[112:38.27]It's true.
[112:46.72]Oh my god, this guy is just, he's paying off everybody.
[112:58.23]Well, I'm here for 31 more days.
[113:00.43]Whatever.
[113:09.28]Um... Am I alright?
[113:13.35]We both know that justice was done, Mii Strong.
[113:15.24]Why don't we put this all behind us and move on?
[113:18.50]I don't have control of my character anymore.
[113:22.93]I did not pick that.
[113:26.44]That won't be the last time.
[113:27.29]I didn't pick that.
[113:28.63]He has a mind of his own right now.
[113:29.77]He literally just went crazy and said that.
[113:31.64]I did not say that.
[113:34.06]I can't believe they moved me to cell two of the North Block.
[113:44.01]Karma finally caught up to you, me strong.
[113:46.10]Perhaps now you'll think twice about your behavior.
[113:50.14]Yeah.
[113:52.28]Get...
[113:53.09]Okay, this...
[113:53.68]They all have it out for me so bad!
[113:56.31]I'm sorry, but I'm taking this and it's just going to be, I'm fucking unloading.
[114:01.12]They won't let me do anything.
[114:02.24]I'm taking this and I'm unloading on this guy.
[114:09.78]Alright.
[114:10.07]No, he's backing off.
[114:10.90]He's backing off.
[114:20.83]This guy sucks.
[114:25.51]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[114:26.67]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[114:29.81]Okay, okay.
[114:36.48]Something's happening.
[114:48.32]Help!
[114:50.02]Shoot him!
[114:51.35]Shoot him!
[115:02.09]Don't think this changes anything.
[115:03.62]I only saved your life to avoid ruining mine.
[115:06.13]Oh, that was the biggest mistake of your whole life.
[115:10.01]biggest mistake of your entire life.
[115:19.03]He brought me back to kill me again.
[115:20.90]That's some diabolical, chaotic evil type shit.
[115:26.73]That's chaotic evil.
[115:28.38]And I'm sorry, I gotta, I gotta, it's time to retaliate.
[115:33.28]Stay focused on him before anything happens.
[115:35.45]Bro, I just got shot in the chest with a fucking bazooka three times.
[115:39.44]I'm on the...
[115:40.12]I'm literally lying on the ground!
[115:41.44]I'm...
[115:42.51]I'm...
[115:42.91]I'm... No, that was mine!
[115:46.78]That was my soda!
[115:50.00]I wouldn't be professional to say mad at each other forever if he's wrong.
[115:53.98]You know, you're right.
[115:55.45]You know, you're right.
[115:56.40]Let's bury the hatchet.
[115:57.62]Why don't we put it behind us so that we can both get on with our lives in peace?
[115:59.94]I agree.
[116:01.89]Yes, we should.
[116:05.27]Let's make peace.
[116:07.25]No more of this bullshit.
[116:08.92]Glad you agree.
[116:09.58]Thank you.
[116:10.87]Everybody can get along.
[116:11.74]You can have that soda too.
[116:13.17]I just opened it.
[116:13.99]The seal broke on it so you know it's fresh.
[116:32.86]Oh my god!
[116:36.39]He wants to make peace.
[116:40.11]Let's make peace, dude.
[116:41.39]I can see...
[116:48.07]I can't see us being friends, but at least we can be peaceful.
[116:52.06]You know what?
[116:52.84]Hey.
[116:53.97]You know what?
[116:55.09]Let's shake hands.
[116:55.99]You gotta shake on it, though.
[117:02.58]Something you want to say to me?
[117:06.51]Can you prescribe me some painkillers?
[117:10.38]Yeah, we should shake hands.
[117:11.44]For just $14, I could hook you up with some painkillers.
[117:13.87]That would replenish your health.
[117:19.15]I think he's dead.
[117:24.41]He's dead.
[117:31.15]He's alive.
[117:32.82]He's alive.
[117:33.52]Okay.
[117:34.22]Yes, I would love some painkillers, please, for $14.
[117:36.73]Sounds like a steal.
[117:37.56]Ugh.
[117:42.27]Alright.
[117:44.00]I'm back in action.
[117:46.14]You should have finished the job, Maestrong.
[117:47.67]Now I won't stop until you're finished.
[117:49.53]What are you talking about?
[117:50.68]This guy is all over the place.
[117:57.51]Oh my god!
[118:05.59]Shit on his head!
[118:06.69]Did I shit on him?
[118:08.42]I think I shit on him.
[118:10.18]I'm sorry!
[118:10.87]I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shit on his head.
[118:14.30]I gotta get out.
[118:19.82]I have to pee in this urinal.
[118:22.29]Okay.
[118:26.04]Alright.
[118:26.48]Alright.
[118:27.04]I'm out.
[118:27.24]I'm out.
[118:27.51]I'm out.
[118:27.75]I'm out.
[118:34.89]I'm taking this with me in case I need it.
[118:37.42]No, that makes me slow.
[118:39.39]Okay, what's my strategy?
[118:40.80]Climb over the fence, right?
[118:44.37]What did I just do?
[118:45.04]I just exited the game.
[119:02.56]Get out!
[119:03.64]Get out!
[119:07.50]The entire prison is in here.
[119:12.74]Thanks for getting rid of Doug!
[119:30.47]How am I still alive?
[119:32.02]The fucking mayor is here!
[119:44.17]Oh, fuck!
[119:44.90]I'm in the toilet!
[119:50.38]Get out of the way!
[119:50.86]Get out of the way!
[119:51.30]This is important, important, important!
[119:53.35]Dude, I got brass knuckles now.
[120:07.87]There's a hole right there.
[120:08.77]There's a hole in the ground.
[120:12.04]Here we go.
[120:13.11]Go.
[120:20.62]No, I don't wanna be in the courthouse!
[120:22.03]What are you doing?!
[120:24.57]No!
[120:27.70]It was a trap.
[120:28.34]It was a trap.
[120:28.80]They laid like a League of Legends 2 move.
[120:31.90]Officer Turner is dead because of you.
[120:37.92]I cannot believe they got me with the fake hole in the ground.
[120:42.43]Somebody literally put like a League of Legends move.
[120:44.64]That's like a two.
[120:45.36]That's like, oh, Teemo put down his fucking trap.
[120:54.32]Officer Turner is dead.
[121:01.26]I may have found Officer Turner dead, but that doesn't mean that I...
[121:05.18]The crowd of public opinion here is like, this guy's fucked up.
[121:08.73]Let's get rid of him.
[121:12.90]I don't think I'm going to get out of this one.
[121:16.73]Yeah.
[121:24.67]To be fair, Officer Turner did try to kill me three times before we squashed the beef.
[121:32.53]And then he attacked me again and then I did kill him.
[121:38.07]But we did squash the beef before he reengaged.
[121:49.47]Only four more days, yeah.
[121:50.77]This game is insane.
[121:52.32]And I knew it was going to be.
[121:56.64]I can't believe I shit on his head after I... Well, that just sounds like a horrible thing to say out loud.
[122:09.57]I failed a mission.
[122:10.70]I don't know.
[122:11.00]Dude, I was getting arrested for murder at that point.
[122:12.82]Sorry, man.
[122:17.30]High reputation gives you a chance of winning cases.
[122:19.68]Ah, okay.
[122:30.39]Alright, now we're going to play it as the straight man, right?
[122:32.87]I'm only going to be calm, collected, not going to make any jokes.
[122:36.39]We're going straight man here.
[122:38.97]I'm gonna be sharing a cell.
[122:40.95]Okay.
[122:41.55]That's fine.
[122:47.28]Okay, me and Boomtown seem to be friends.
[122:51.71]That's good.
[122:59.23]Get down from there.
[122:59.97]Don't hurt yourself.
[123:03.18]Let me just get through one full day of not doing anything insane.
[123:07.56]That's all I'm trying to do.
[123:10.87]I'm gonna go out to the yard.
[123:16.38]Oh man, you just left this here.
[123:18.21]Okay, I can sneak up.
[123:28.17]It's not enough to see you lose.
[123:29.30]You need to pay the ultimate price.
[123:31.05]No.
[123:33.79]That means I'm going to kill you.
[123:38.57]What does this guy even want me to do?
[123:51.53]Did this guy even give us a mission?
[123:53.06]I don't remember him doing anything.
[123:55.81]Okay, hold on.
[123:56.73]This is where we gotta go.
[123:58.60]We're out.
[124:03.86]Right at the front door, I got the key.
[124:11.97]See ya.
[124:19.20]Oh my God.
[124:20.35]Is the horse alive?
[124:30.36]I love how the NPCs out here are wrestlers.
[124:33.29]Alright, that's exactly what I'm looking for.
[124:36.94]That's fine.
[124:37.78]I'm getting out.
[124:38.25]I'm getting on the bus.
[124:47.05]Wrong way.
[124:59.45]Get down!
[125:00.11]Get down!
[125:10.98]I'm just trying to leave.
[125:11.66]I'm just trying to leave.
[125:14.86]Oh my god, we're actually moving.
[125:20.05]Sit down!
[125:30.64]Hello?
[125:31.02]Who's driving the bus?
[126:00.66]Sleep at the wheel!
[126:02.13]Oh no!
[126:10.39]Yeah, I would call somebody, too.
[126:12.00]Oh, man, people are getting... You can't wake me up.
[126:15.02]I'm such a heavy sleeper.
[126:23.27]Take it easy.
[126:25.76]My mobile phone is no match for your light tube.
[126:31.47]No, get off!
[126:32.33]Get up!
[126:33.24]Get- I wanna get off the bus!
[126:37.99]It's Hodge!
[126:44.01]Eh!
[127:10.16]Officer Hart almost died because of you.
[127:20.64]Okay, do you know what this game is like?
[127:23.27]And the other MDickey games are like this.
[127:26.09]Wrestling Empire was like this too.
[127:28.36]Imagine if you just constantly had three stars in GTA.
[127:34.77]And even the civilians treat you that way.
[127:37.27]There's probably a mod for GTA that's like that.
[127:42.23]It just feels like the entire game is hostile.
[127:44.76]Even people that just shouldn't be.
[127:48.09]It's just total hostility.
[127:56.77]Alright.
[127:58.80]Can I make it through one full day without getting arrested?
[128:08.35]I'm going to do it.
[128:09.43]This is the one right now
[128:16.53]That was a pretty good run, though.
[128:17.72]Is the goal to...
[128:20.43]Okay, if you try to escape, let's say you could serve out your whole sentence.
[128:23.74]If you escape, is it actually to try to get to the airport and get on a plane?
[128:27.39]And did I just not have enough money last time?
[128:34.10]Just do the quests?
[128:37.64]I think my reputation is so bad right now, I don't even know if I can...
[128:45.66]Subtitles by Subtitle Workshop
[128:55.78]Okay.
[128:57.03]New day.
[129:00.34]We're gonna just take a little browse around.
[129:01.85]Can't believe they moved me.
[129:03.53]Neither can I, bro.
[129:04.30]It's crazy.
[129:07.02]That's crazy.
[129:11.68]That's unbelievable.
[129:13.09]They moved me too.
[129:19.09]Okay, I'm not- this is bait because it- you get involved, somebody hits a stray punch, you shit on somebody accidentally, and then the whole world collapses.
[129:29.13]I'm going to the library.
[129:30.46]I'm just going to go read a book to make sure that I don't get in any trouble.
[129:38.71]See, look, we both know that justice was done.
[129:42.43]Why don't we put all this behind us?
[129:44.07]That, yes.
[129:47.78]That settles it.
[129:49.78]Now let me read.
[129:50.55]Oh my god.
[130:01.73]I'm just going to read a book.
[130:04.88]That's my seat.
[130:05.74]Get up before I sit on you.
[130:07.33]Okay.
[130:08.59]I did not know the seat was taken.
[130:09.77]I will get up.
[130:10.64]Absolutely.
[130:12.35]I'm so sorry, you can have it back.
[130:14.11]I did not know.
[130:16.22]That's right, this throne belongs to the king.
[130:18.11]You should sit at my feet to show some respect.
[130:22.39]Well, I'm not going to do that, but I appreciate the fact that you have your own seat here.
[130:28.91]Thanks for taking care of Kenny Hodge.
[130:30.26]It's about time somebody taught him a lesson.
[130:35.65]You're welcome, Sharon.
[130:38.05]Okay, now let me sit down.
[130:39.19]It's been a very stressful day.
[130:42.94]Says, Essa Carrera is the most agile prisoner in the city.
[130:47.22]Mm-hmm.
[130:48.88]Good.
[130:49.26]Alright.
[130:49.95]Well, let me sit at my...
[130:50.89]I'm going to sit here.
[130:51.55]Hopefully this isn't taken by anybody.
[130:55.89]And let me read my book.
[130:58.50]I'll use the computer too, that's fine.
[131:00.89]It says here it's more comfortable to sleep on a bed than anywhere else.
[131:06.76]That make sense?
[131:14.38]It says here scientists are studying people who have superhuman abilities.
[131:18.81]Wow, very interesting.
[131:27.49]Am I gaining stats?
[131:32.61]It says here you can aim by standing still before you fire a weapon.
[131:35.58]Good to know.
[131:40.18]I wanna read the book.
[131:46.45]We're spending the day reading.
[131:50.47]Looks like I managed to pull up the file of a civilian by the name of Mike Roman.
[131:55.60]Okay.
[131:57.11]What do you got?
[131:58.14]The 51-year-old stands at 5 feet 6 and weighs 283.
[132:01.05]Let's see what kind of stats that is good for.
[132:06.30]90% reputation, 76 strength, 85% skill.
[132:09.26]Did you give me this guy's stats?
[132:11.49]Is that supposed to be Joe Rogan?
[132:14.71]It's currently fashionable to show male flesh 14, but not fashionable to have tattoos, okay?
[132:26.11]It's currently fashionable to show male flesh 14.
[132:28.79]Maybe I should do that.
[132:32.42]Okay, that was an eventful day.
[132:38.92]I think I've learned some things.
[132:40.94]I'm good.
[132:42.15]We should be friends or something.
[132:49.25]Something you want to say?
[132:50.27]Yeah, let's be friends.
[132:57.33]Never mind.
[133:02.36]I didn't... Well, I just want to say hello.
[133:03.97]Okay, that's fine.
[133:11.20]You have to press left.
[133:13.52]Press left, does that mean, like, good?
[133:21.73]Left means, like, yes.
[133:27.24]Ow.
[133:29.33]Um...
[133:30.86]I'm not going to jail.
[133:32.34]I'm not going to jail.
[133:33.91]I'm not going to jail.
[133:36.84]But that guy just tried to clean... That guy's gonna die.
[133:39.35]It's not gonna be my fault.
[133:40.24]I didn't do anything.
[133:42.21]I did absolutely nothing.
[133:43.51]I have nothing to do with any of this.
[133:47.89]But shit's heating up right now.
[133:50.24]And I mean that both figuratively and, you know, I didn't touch anybody.
[133:56.72]There's witnesses here that show I didn't.
[134:02.03]I didn't touch anything.
[134:04.85]I'm just trying to get through one day without hurting anybody.
[134:08.78]Get the gun?
[134:09.47]No, I'm not doing anything, actually.
[134:12.56]I'm just hanging out.
[134:18.57]The library's on fire!
[134:19.83]Put it out before it's too late!
[134:22.87]Don't put this on me!
[134:24.71]What do you mean?
[134:27.24]Oh my god!
[134:28.31]I don't know, because it's gonna be my fault!
[134:37.08]Um, alright, fine.
[134:38.62]I don't know what to do.
[134:39.28]How do I put the fire out?
[134:49.82]That hurts!
[135:00.08]Put it out with the gun.
[135:00.97]I need a fire extinguisher.
[135:06.46]Why is there no fire extinguisher in here?
[135:09.70]You need to leave?
[135:14.85]Can you give me the finger?
[135:20.74]I don't have time to talk to you.
[135:22.10]Come on.
[135:27.32]Just get out of there and eat an orange.
[135:30.63]Okay, this is the workshop.
[135:32.67]Wouldn't it be great if we could share a cell, MeStrong?
[135:34.62]Why don't you join me in cell nine?
[135:36.06]This is the most agile guy in the prison.
[135:39.47]Yeah.
[135:43.62]Perfect.
[135:47.55]Okay.
[135:49.06]Uh, I'm gonna put out the fire.
[135:50.74]That's a good Samaritan thing to do, right?
[135:59.01]I got it.
[135:59.44]I'll take it.
[135:59.73]It's under control.
[136:10.35]I'm trying to aim down!
[136:11.76]How do I aim down?
[136:20.54]I mean, I kind of did it.
[136:22.60]The project's escaping!
[136:29.30]I can't escape.
[136:30.53]What happened to my voice there?
[136:31.50]My voice just exploded.
[136:43.85]What can I do in the workshop?
[136:48.29]Maybe I can paint?
[136:55.83]We're buds, right?
[137:01.90]Uh, can I have the broom?
[137:05.63]What am I supposed to be doing?
[137:07.36]Um...
[137:15.98]When did I get a time limit for that?
[137:19.67]Oh my god.
[137:23.22]I need a fire extinguisher right now.
[137:26.17]I tried to put it out too.
[137:28.14]Should I escape?
[137:29.36]Maybe I should just...
[137:34.44]I need a fire extinguisher right now.
[137:35.45]Go.
[137:40.55]Okay, good luck.
[137:41.55]I need a fire extinguisher.
[137:46.13]I don't see one anywhere.
[137:51.58]Is that one?
[137:52.18]Yep, right here.
[138:04.44]Hurry up.
[138:08.70]Do I have to go through the workshop?
[138:14.99]Please watch out.
[138:19.61]Oh my god, has it gotten worse?
[138:24.29]Dude, I actually cannot aim it.
[138:34.56]Oh, thank God.
[138:35.97]Alright, we're good.
[138:38.81]Oh my God, it's more shits on fire.
[138:44.79]Get out of the way, I'm trying!
[138:48.35]Turn the camera!
[138:49.88]Turn!
[138:50.36]Stop!
[138:51.58]Turn the camera!
[138:52.95]Turn the camera!
[138:54.09]Turn the camera!
[138:55.94]Turn the camera!
[138:58.09]Camera!
[138:59.97]What the fuck is happening?
[139:07.23]It's out.
[139:08.10]It's shits out.
[139:11.74]No, stop talking to me!
[139:13.19]Stop talking to me!
[139:19.64]Dude, I can't turn around.
[139:21.19]How do I turn around?
[139:22.24]How do I turn around?
[139:27.80]You can't.
[139:28.67]It's just making me face the direction.
[139:30.42]I cannot get off.
[139:33.48]There's no on target.
[139:41.12]Is it both bumpers at the same time?
[139:42.77]This is so annoying.
[139:45.54]I can't.
[139:54.52]I cannot untarget.
[139:56.17]D-pad up, D-pad down, D-pad left, D-pad right.
[139:59.52]There's no untarget button.
[140:04.19]I have to be tar- I have the book in my- Hold left bumper.
[140:09.82]Oh my God, dude.
[140:10.90]What the fuck?
[140:17.03]You have to hold down left bumper for like three seconds.
[140:26.66]Did I get it?
[140:32.69]Please escort me there.
[140:41.43]Hold the bumper.
[140:42.89]God, dude.
[140:46.55]You gotta be kidding me.
[140:48.87]Well, at least I got a book I can read.
[141:04.28]I was rolling around shooting random people with a fire extinguisher because I couldn't untarget from somebody.
[141:10.72]Oh my god.
[141:11.79]That is so... That is so funny.
[141:16.39]In every worst possible way.
[141:20.43]Yep.
[141:21.49]Mm-hmm.
[141:32.81]Uh-huh.
[141:34.82]That's fine.
[141:37.93]At least now I know how to do that.
[141:39.79]If I ever need to untarget somebody, you just hold the button.
[141:48.85]Wait, this book is burnt.
[141:58.70]No, I got to go full 24 hours.
[142:00.71]I'm not doing anything.
[142:09.43]What is this?
[142:18.10]What is this thing?
[142:20.45]It's like a leg of a table.
[142:25.96]What's up?
[142:28.52]Something you want to say to me?
[142:29.44]Yeah, let's um... Let's hang out.
[142:32.93]Where even is my... Can I have that hammer?
[142:39.74]You'll never get your hands on my hammer.
[142:41.19]Go find something else.
[142:46.53]Plus, left or right for dialog options.
[142:55.47]Hey.
[143:04.35]It's a menu?
[143:12.09]Select the options when... Oh, wait a minute.
[143:14.67]Really?
[143:16.64]So if I talk to this guy again...
[143:19.41]And he says, what do you want?
[143:21.21]If I press left or right, I can switch between different... Oh...
[143:28.46]Because I could do up and down with switching moods.
[143:30.51]Alright.
[143:30.99]Let me talk to you then.
[143:32.81]Since we're such good friends, I need you to do me a favor.
[143:34.60]Alright.
[143:35.42]I'm going to help you.
[143:36.68]And I need to get this done.
[143:39.98]You're too overweight to be friends with me.
[143:43.94]Damn dude.
[143:45.25]How do I lose weight?
[143:47.73]Reduce your weight to 535 by 17 or I'll have to reconsider the company.
[143:53.71]How do I lose my weight?
[143:57.06]Puke.
[143:58.37]Right?
[143:58.57]If I ate, if I eat and then puke?
[144:00.20]That's the only, I honestly, that's the only way I know how to do it.
[144:02.25]I don't know any other way.
[144:10.07]Is there a gym?
[144:11.07]Can I maybe go to the yard?
[144:20.35]Like, play basketball or something?
[144:21.59]Wait, wait, wait.
[144:27.46]How much weight?
[144:27.94]What do I have to be at?
[144:28.46]535?
[144:30.61]Dude, you want me to lose 10 pounds in four hours?
[144:32.86]Five hours?
[144:33.44]You crazy?
[144:52.16]Okay, I need to eat.
[145:02.89]You're gonna die, dude.
[145:04.04]No, I'm fine.
[145:05.88]I think I actually might be able to do this one.
[145:10.75]I hope you found my support useful, MeStrong.
[145:13.53]I need to take care of something on my own.
[145:15.33]You got it?
[145:24.46]Well, that was rude.
[145:26.08]Was that me telling him that his conversation was boring?
[145:28.93]Oh, fuck.
[145:29.69]I slept through the weight loss.
[145:36.64]No!
[145:37.59]What the hell?
[145:38.83]Oh my god, he's never going to be my friend.
[145:44.76]Oh shit, what if I hide?
[145:52.50]Come on.
[145:55.34]No.
[145:59.69]Please pass one quest.
[146:02.25]I just tried, man.
[146:03.61]I didn't know that sitting down was going to make me sleep.
[146:08.45]I guess because I had such low health from working out?
[146:12.22]Well, at least I have this friend here.
[146:16.63]What's up?
[146:20.89]How you doing?
[146:23.46]Come on, Grant, you and I.
[146:24.97]Something you want to say?
[146:25.57]Yeah, I want to talk to you.
[146:31.37]Okay.
[146:34.40]Uh, I can't switch dialog options?
[146:37.51]Whoa!
[146:38.15]Would you like to be friends?
[146:39.55]Do you need some money?
[146:42.10]Can I join?
[146:42.70]Okay.
[146:45.35]Is there anything I can do for you?
[146:48.89]I'm expecting an important phone call.
[146:50.23]Do you think you could answer it by one?
[146:51.74]Yes.
[146:59.65]I'm going to sleep through this request.
[147:16.32]Why am I sleeping so much?
[147:20.90]Ugh.
[147:21.00]Alright, well, fuck you.
[147:21.96]I don't care.
[147:22.64]I don't like you either.
[147:27.49]What about you?
[147:28.06]Can I make friends with somebody, please?
[147:30.09]Officer Newberry?
[147:39.74]Talk to me.
[147:54.00]Could you ever forgive me?
[147:57.78]Okay.
[147:58.81]Is there anything I can do for you?
[148:03.37]Could you deliver an extinguisher to the police station by nine this morning?
[148:07.65]Am I allowed in the police station?
[148:12.50]Why does he do this every time somebody talks to him?
[148:25.46]Wait, am I even gonna...
[148:26.80]I need an extinguisher.
[148:42.22]What are you doing?
[148:43.28]I need an extinguisher to bring back to the cell.
[148:49.33]I don't see anything in here.
[149:06.97]Get down.
[149:14.73]No, I need an extinguisher.
[149:20.35]Library, maybe?
[149:21.50]Come on.
[149:25.76]There you go.
[149:26.24]Okay.
[149:27.89]Bring it to the station.
[149:41.45]Okay, wait, it's not open yet.
[149:42.58]How do I even do this?
[149:45.30]You have to go through visitation.
[149:54.86]How do I get to the... Where is that?
[149:59.24]Visitors?
[150:03.75]Oh, right here.
[150:07.32]Alright.
[150:08.65]I have this.
[150:09.30]How do I give this to you?
[150:19.47]Maybe set it down?
[150:20.49]Oh my goodness.
[150:23.64]Listen to me, Strong.
[150:24.16]I'd appreciate it if you could do me a favor.
[150:25.77]I did it.
[150:29.79]Um, could you make sure that Luke answer gets a trophy by 2200 tonight?
[150:38.35]That's a long time.
[150:40.25]Alright, self-block.
[150:50.58]Where would I get a trophy?
[150:53.58]There's one in the yard.
[150:54.28]Nice work.
[150:55.34]That will get your sentence down to 36 days.
[150:57.41]Why did I lose reputation?
[150:59.83]It is a gun, too.
[151:07.30]You can let go of the gun now.
[151:10.34]Okay.
[151:12.16]You.
[151:12.37]I like you.
[151:16.37]You and me, friend.

[151:19.94]Yes, escort me there.
[151:25.77]Yes.
[151:34.08]There's a trophy on the ground!
[151:39.25]You shouldn't exert yourself that much this early.
[151:41.12]Only spend energy you have to spare.
[151:45.96]Okay, Joker.
[151:56.13]The door isn't going to open in any second.
[152:05.32]Wake up, MeStrong.
[152:06.29]You can't sleep during the day.
[152:09.72]Alright, I'm getting up.
[152:13.79]There's plenty of time to sleep between 20 and 8.
[152:20.87]Okay, I need a trophy.
[152:23.24]And bring it to south block.
[152:24.59]So it was in the hallway.
[152:26.17]Well, I hope it didn't despawn.

[152:59.06]Hey, I got something for you.
[153:00.67]Hey, Lucancer.
[153:01.25]I was sent by Amy Zola to give you this trophy.
[153:08.11]After I beat Zola to death with this trophy, I oughta give you a taste of it, me strong.
[153:15.45]Was that... he didn't like that?

[153:45.29]But what is going on over here?
[153:48.19]What is going on over here?
[153:49.22]Why is this guy like attached to a chain?

[154:21.43]Are you stupid?
[154:27.80]You don't know what to do with the key.
[154:34.58]I hate you so much, Hodge.

[159:08.64]Alright, everybody move!
[159:13.68]Um, shoot the flamethrower?
[159:24.97]It didn't even start a fire!
[159:26.00]God damn it!
[159:36.21]It didn't even work.
[159:39.20]The table exploded.
[159:40.44]Taunt plus pick up.
[159:58.26]That might work.
[160:05.55]Taunt and pick up at the same time.
[160:10.36]Oh, come on.
[160:11.08]Officer War.
[160:12.09]That's right.
[160:16.05]Officer War.
[160:16.99]Officer Kill.
[160:17.81]Officer Murder.
[160:24.38]That actually sucks.
[160:25.93]It's the money I just got.
[160:39.59]Well, I didn't do it, and now she hates me, so we're moving on to somebody else to be friends with.
[160:46.19]Okay, what if Amy likes us?
[160:48.64]We just did a mission for Amy.
[160:51.83]Who else in here likes us?
[160:54.34]Oh, Officer Newberry!
[160:56.78]I thought that was him saying that.
[161:01.69]Wait, I can still do it.
[161:14.00]Alright, taunt plus pick up, somebody said.
[161:23.43]For conspiracy?
[161:24.75]Alright, I did what you wanted!
[161:41.89]It's like Socrates.
[161:44.36]I'm ready for my sentencing.
[161:50.26]I will drink the canister.
[161:55.22]Because I know it is poisoned, but I don't care.
[161:59.46]The principle of my philosophy will show that I knew it was poisoned and they killed me.
[162:13.75]Burn more things in there?
[162:15.13]Is it not enough?
[162:20.85]Somebody shot at me.
[162:21.74]That was like Yosemite Sam.
[162:34.86]That's a riot!
[162:48.09]I better have gotten bonus points.
[163:02.94]Mii Strong is a known member of Mii Strong's gang.
[163:08.83]That is really sad.
[163:12.42]That's an insult that's wrapped up as a, that's an in-game coding insult.
[163:21.23]That's trying to tell me that I have no friends.
[163:24.95]Even the direct code that's baked in.
[163:31.20]I thought the judge just changed.
[163:37.25]The one horseman.
[163:43.03]What?
[163:46.45]Did they cut my arm off?
[163:49.57]They legitimately took my arm!
[163:58.90]Wait, I committed conspiracy with myself, so they cut my hand off.
[164:11.10]Can I get it back?
[164:30.46]Okay, well, now what?
[164:31.74]I gotta talk to, um, Harley Quinn.
[164:36.41]I lost a hand for Harley Quinn.
[164:41.07]That's crazy.
[164:45.28]Okay, nice shades.
[164:49.67]That guy's a dweeb.
[164:54.50]Alright, where's Harley Quinn?
[165:06.70]South block.
[165:13.45]Thanks, MeStrong.
[165:14.42]That's why I love you.
[165:15.44]I hope I can return the favor someday.
[165:17.35]Wait, you love me?
[165:30.24]Okay.
[165:33.40]So, should we do some more things?
[165:36.59]I feel like that's a... How do I not have more level up from that?
[165:42.61]The bar below the health is sanity not reputation.
[165:45.90]Oh.
[165:51.73]We can't see each other anymore.
[165:55.89]Can I do something for you?
[165:57.74]So this is my girlfriend?
[165:59.43]You're too overweight.
[166:00.39]Okay.
[166:01.74]You're too overweight to be a member of Funny Business.
[166:04.01]I need to lose how much weight?
[166:07.30]Reduce your weight.
[166:11.63]Excuse me.
[166:12.43]I need to...
[166:14.51]I need to lose 300 pounds?
[166:17.89]Hey!
[166:23.21]I'm on my way to the toilet if you want to come.
[166:25.26]Um, are we pissing together?

[166:33.52]Just follow me and I'll get you to the- wait, is this because I've gone to the bathroom so much that the game's Luigi-ing me?
[166:38.25]Into- hey, you need to go to the bathroom?
[166:53.66]Who's drinking piss?
[167:03.38]Speed shower.
[167:13.27]Was it- is it- were you doing drugs?
[167:15.10]Wait, where'd you get that?
[167:16.42]Hold on a second.
[167:19.56]Are you doing drugs?
[167:24.50]Dude, what do you got there?
[167:26.86]What is that?
[167:30.42]I gotta put the skateboard down.
[167:35.34]Hey.
[167:39.79]Could I have some of that?
[167:41.08]What is it?
[167:41.52]Wait, is it bad?
[167:51.28]Holy shit, they're doing drugs!
[167:53.98]Right in front of the military guy?
[168:03.77]Alright, there's something I can do for you.
[168:05.02]Should I take it?
[168:11.43]What am I supposed to be doing?
[168:12.48]Sorry.
[168:13.58]Do you have any advice?
[168:14.48]Can you give me some money?
[168:15.59]Do you need some money?
[168:16.49]Could we be more than friends?
[168:18.24]Why can't we be friends anymore?
[168:20.24]Can I join?
[168:20.90]Can you protect me?
[168:21.59]Can I have that syringe?
[168:26.18]Oh.
[168:27.05]Okay.
[168:36.16]Does it work?
[168:48.20]Bro, there's nothing left in here!
[168:49.31]He took it all!
[168:52.38]There's nothing left!
[169:04.32]Well, time for some flora watermelon.
[169:12.39]Okay, well.
[169:16.00]I gotta go find my girlfriend.
[169:21.14]I guess I could go to the hospital.
[169:22.10]How much is it to replace a limb?
[169:23.97]Oh, there you are.
[169:35.07]How are you doing?
[169:48.45]Are you sure that's sanity on the bottom?
[169:50.35]It feels like that's a relationship bar.
[169:54.57]Did you know that Brock Buster is the most popular prisoner in the city?
[169:57.56]Why are you telling me that?
[170:06.39]Yeah, something you want to say.
[170:07.35]She's trying to make you jealous, dude.
[170:11.90]Uh-oh.
[170:15.38]Give me some money.
[170:16.03]Uh, can I join?
[170:18.09]Um...
[170:23.16]I need to lose.
[170:24.35]Can I lose 300 pounds?
[170:25.75]How do you lose 300 pounds?
[170:37.54]I need a lifestyle change.
[170:49.30]Do you know you can use tissue if you can't make it to a toilet?
[170:54.46]Really?
[170:54.72]That's actually good advice.
[171:06.38]Okay, well.
[171:08.06]Uh, I need to talk to the doctor.
[171:09.71]Oh my god, I just punched her in the face.
[171:11.15]I'm so sorry.
[171:13.50]Alright, doctor, I need my limb replaced.
[171:19.83]Would you like this medical kit?
[171:20.79]Seems you need it.
[171:21.62]Yes.
[171:24.15]Hey, thanks Scott.
[171:30.83]You're welcome.
[171:31.73]That's what friends are for.
[171:34.12]Alright.
[171:35.56]Hell yeah.
[171:43.18]Alright, I got to talk to you.
[171:53.80]Can you restore my hand?
[171:55.10]Do you think it's worth paying $22 for the surgery?
[172:01.32]That's all the money I have, but I'm gonna do it.
[172:09.29]You'd be even better than you were before.
[172:13.13]Strength is back.
[172:13.76]Good.
[172:17.57]Perfect.
[172:18.58]Okay, now I need to be 75 pounds or she's breaking up with me.
[172:23.53]That's crazy.
[172:25.62]That's crazy.
[172:39.37]I don't think it's physically possible.
[172:43.88]Go play basketball?
[172:44.90]I'm not gonna lose 450 pounds in an hour.
[172:52.77]She's following you?
[173:03.13]What is she doing?
[173:07.31]What is going on right now?
[173:11.29]She is following me.
[173:17.14]Well, I got my arm back.
[173:20.26]Whoa!
[173:22.17]Whoa, dude, that now you're on a mission to reduce your weight to 74 pounds.
[173:27.91]It's impossible, dude.
[173:28.63]You're a doctor.
[173:29.19]You should know that.
[173:29.73]What an idiot.
[173:31.30]You wanna explain what you're doing here, dude?
[173:36.07]Go lose weight?
[173:37.01]I can't lose weight!
[173:38.72]My character is 500 pounds!
[173:42.67]What do you mean lose weight?
[174:06.50]Yeah, go pump iron.
[174:07.46]Sure.
[174:08.61]Time to lose one pound and delete all my health bar.
[174:12.77]Give me that dumbbell.
[174:24.44]Everything that you... Oh, wait.
[174:25.73]I can't play basketball.
[174:27.46]What if I get a shot?
[174:28.46]Let me try it.
[174:34.95]Okay, ready?
[174:41.63]Uh, I'd have to get this like 50 times and I'll... What are you looking for?
[174:45.79]Oh, she just wanted... She wanted a smooch.
[174:52.84]This is Italy.
[174:54.08]We're...
[174:56.71]Wanted for... Are we having sex?
[175:00.22]What are you talking about?
[175:03.86]Um...
[175:08.97]What?
[175:17.68]She just ran to the wall!
[175:25.41]Okay, so we have to take care of... Mick Bentley?
[175:28.72]Where is he?
[175:32.17]Apparently, I just had sex with Harley Quinn out in the prison yard.
[175:35.57]That's a sentence.
[175:40.51]He can't apparently.
[175:50.42]Don't worry, Meestrong.
[175:51.16]I'll take care of Officer Bentley for you.
[175:55.16]Get a room.
[175:55.95]Let me take you somewhere more private.
[176:00.74]Oh, we're both in here.
[176:09.23]What happened?
[176:16.22]Meestrong was caught kissing Haley King, which is strictly prohibited in prison.
[176:20.06]Wait, oh.
[176:22.70]We weren't having sex.
[176:25.03]I was simply greeting one of my friends and then the officer apparently grabbed me.
[176:29.60]We were kissing.
[176:39.84]It's not supposed to be a dating service.
[176:53.77]Let's see how I like being chained to Officer Bentley because I can't be trusted to roam free.
[176:59.89]This guy's dead.
[177:02.02]You're not locked up in here with me.
[177:04.16]You're unlocked- You're in- I'm locked up and you're DEAD!
[177:21.19]Grrrr!
[177:35.56]I trust you're as sick of being tied to me as I am of you, so let's never do this again.
[177:48.02]Oh.
[177:52.14]Okay.
[177:58.53]Well, that worked.
[178:02.84]I need some food.
[178:07.56]I didn't lose enough weight.
[178:08.95]Sorry, I couldn't lose 430 pounds in a day.
[178:15.34]Oh, I have to...
[178:15.74]I gotta go to... Where's my cell?
[178:17.71]What cell am I in?
[178:20.40]What are you doing in my cell?
[178:21.46]You're supposed to be in cell 9.
[178:22.38]I... Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[178:24.75]I'm going.
[178:44.80]Is that the toilet that talked to you?
[178:46.23]No.
[178:46.47]Wait, is this my cellmate?
[178:49.01]Why is our door not closed?
[178:54.73]Make her follow you and escape together.
[178:56.90]I could try that, but I don't want to get her killed.
[179:05.56]The only friend I have.
[179:19.92]Easy.
[179:21.11]Yeah, I know.
[179:22.38]It's impossible.
[179:26.40]Wait, what?
[179:28.13]You're trying your best.
[179:28.81]You have until six o'clock tomorrow.
[179:31.22]You can't keep adding time.
[179:38.92]Come on.
[179:40.18]That was intentional.
[179:41.55]That was intentional.
[179:55.86]How do we do that again?
[180:05.60]I wonder if she can follow me.
[180:12.07]You need to go exercise.
[180:13.05]It's not... Dude, it's not gonna work.
[180:19.71]It is not going to work.
[180:28.26]You haven't even tried?
[180:29.27]Okay.
[180:31.51]I will go lift weights and lose one pound.
[180:36.65]Edit your character in the main menu.
[180:40.42]Huh?
[180:46.76]How do I do that?
[180:58.49]I don't think I can.
[181:05.59]Find a hair dryer.
[181:06.49]Oh, good call.
[181:08.42]Hair dryer.
[181:10.53]What's wrong?
[181:11.02]What is it?
[181:11.40]They shot me for no reason.
[181:12.66]Why is he shooting me?
[181:14.67]Somebody want to explain what's going on?
[181:18.72]Why did you just shoot me for no reason?
[181:24.31]Alright, hair dryer, come on.
[181:30.68]I have time.
[181:49.28]Dude, where's a hair dryer when you need one?
[182:02.34]I think all you can edit in the menu is hair and clothes.
[182:07.53]Check the bathtub.
[182:09.98]Bathroom, maybe.
[182:16.30]Did you fail the quest already?
[182:17.40]She gave me till tomorrow.
[182:19.69]But, I mean, I think it is literally impossible.
[182:37.34]Uh, I don't think you can edit your prisoner in the main menu.
[182:42.02]I can start a new game, which...
[182:44.02]Okay, if I start a new game with a new character, and I edit this one too...
[182:48.53]I think we're just gonna fail it.
[182:50.82]Go to the hospital, you can get liposuction.
[182:52.90]I have zero dollars.
[183:04.37]Interact with the closet and you can do it there.
[183:09.85]Who said you could steal that orange from my cell?
[183:11.74]How would you know I took an orange from you?
[183:15.26]Dude's got spies everywhere.
[183:31.10]You find a lot of doors are closed to you if you don't have enough credit.
[183:36.90]Can I have some money?
[183:38.00]I'm asking a random person for money.
[183:41.55]You.
[183:43.37]Yeah.
[183:43.94]Can I have some money?
[183:52.50]Can you give me some money?
[183:55.54]Sorry, I can't spare any cash right now.
[183:56.81]You better work for it like everybody else.
[183:58.94]Somebody will do it.
[184:07.87]Might as well just go have sex with your girlfriend.
[184:15.00]I mean, you have a gun.
[184:15.72]That's crazy.
[184:16.29]But do you have any money?
[184:17.30]Can I please borrow some?
[184:24.68]Please.
[184:26.47]Please.
[184:26.95]Ask the girlfriend for money?
[184:32.53]Where is she?
[184:45.13]The Joker might have a bunch of money, that's true.
[184:54.65]Were they South Block?
[185:00.72]What an idiot.
[185:02.95]I remember my first day in prison, too.
[185:05.37]It's rough, dude.
[185:15.56]Where is she?
[185:16.08]I have not seen her at all.
[185:22.99]Okay, it's time.
[185:24.26]That's self-defense now, you know what I'm saying?
[185:26.05]Like, that's fucking ridiculous.
[185:39.67]Sup, dude?
[185:45.55]Why did you hit me when I hit the ground?
[185:47.07]Uh-huh.
[185:52.40]Leave me alone!
[185:54.58]Stop!
[185:55.42]Leave me alone!
[185:56.19]They just killed me!
[186:02.86]Oh, your spirit seems low.
[186:04.59]Look after your mental health before you snap.
[186:08.21]Yeah, let me look after my mental health.
[186:10.34]My physical health is really not great right now.
[186:13.59]Listen, after what happened, I realized none of this is worth dying for.
[186:19.30]Put this all behind us.
[186:21.26]You're a fucking dead dude.
[186:27.46]This guy, as long as you stay in this room... ...it's time for a fucking... ...Herson barbecue!
[186:35.56]How do I aim?
[186:39.04]We thought we lost you, B-Strong.
[186:40.26]Try to look after yourself in the future.
[186:45.80]Yeah.
[186:47.55]Well.
[186:49.59]Bad enough I can take from Officer fucking Dweeb.
[186:56.38]Am I peeing like a dog?
[187:02.77]Oh, it's empty.
[187:13.92]This is empty too!
[187:15.92]Can you guys leave anything for the rest of us please?
[187:39.74]Where is Harley Quinn?
[187:45.97]Why am I so slow?
[187:54.32]You're dying, bro.
[187:55.46]Go to the hospital.
[187:56.27]I'm alright.
[188:05.27]Uh, um, what'd I do?
[188:08.62]I slept in somebody else's bed?
[188:13.96]If it's that fucking dweeb, I swear to God.
[188:17.63]My God!
[188:27.50]What did I do?
[188:28.28]I didn't get in trouble for anything.
[188:40.52]They shot at you more than Mr. Crime.
[188:42.44]MeStrong seems to have a problem with authority and doesn't follow orders.
[188:45.60]What was the order?
[188:49.45]Oh, you're not allowed to sleep until...
[188:53.75]I slept too early.
[188:57.45]for having a sleep?
[188:58.56]A succulent Chinese sleep?
[189:05.30]That was a good one.
[189:06.24]Thank you.
[189:06.76]Finally.
[189:07.17]It's the first time it's happened in like six arrests.
[189:21.95]Alright.
[189:22.98]I'm getting my revenge eventually.
[189:26.80]But that's not today.
[189:31.54]Get your hand off of my penis.
[189:44.50]Yeah, my character is huge.
[189:47.57]It's funny, but it's also kind of unfortunate because he takes up so much ro-
[189:53.90]Oh wait, I got a friend now.
[189:57.42]Okay.
[189:58.67]Well, I appreciate that.
[190:08.24]Can you let me out?
[190:10.53]Can I have that handgun?
[190:14.82]Oh.
[190:21.71]I thought they were gonna start kissing.
[190:33.70]Come on, MeStrong, didn't you hear the buzzer?
[190:39.78]Alright, where is Harley Quinn?
[190:44.03]I'm actually genuinely confused.
[190:46.22]I haven't seen her in... is she still in prison?
[190:50.91]I'd be real sad if it turns out she got out.
[190:58.65]Did she actually get let out?
[191:04.86]No way.
[191:12.40]Wouldn't it say if she got out?
[191:18.41]Yeah, they announce the departures.
[191:19.53]Yeah, they do.
[191:22.56]I think I was getting unlucky.
[191:29.73]There she is.
[191:31.16]Yeah, I failed.
[191:35.36]I'm just gonna be too fat.
[191:36.87]That's too bad.
[191:40.23]No!
[191:41.01]Do you see that I'm eight feet tall?
[191:45.05]Do you not understand that I'm over eight feet tall?
[191:49.34]She just kicked me.
[191:50.24]They're beating me up.
[191:51.97]I'm, I'm, I'm too, I'm big.
[191:53.98]I'm, I'm a person, I'm a big person.
[191:55.83]I'm sorry.

[193:24.01]This is not my cell but I gotta find a cell that's empty.
[193:28.36]and see if I can get a nap in right here.
[193:31.79]I don't see any officers.
[193:41.46]Okay.

[193:47.88]Can I?
[193:52.85]You can sleep on a toilet.
[193:56.53]You know, maybe I can lay down in the hospital.
[193:59.28]Are you alright?
[194:01.09]Who is this guy?
[194:02.18]Officer, are you good?
[194:16.93]I have to pee.

[195:08.11]I was 540.
[195:17.00]Is this not the way to lose weight?
[195:18.74]Do I have to do cardio or something?
[195:36.14]There's a heavy bag I think outside.
[195:38.15]Do I have to escape?
[195:43.29]Doing the gymnastics is the best way.
[195:45.19]So if I just do cartwheels everywhere, it'll happen?
[195:55.73]It's in the yard Let me check the yard

[200:36.78]I got a Diagro.
[200:37.57]I got Diagro.
[200:45.20]They locked it.
[201:09.28]I was just running in circles.
[201:16.33]I was trying to de-aggro.
[201:18.50]Oh, I'm running out of gas.
[201:20.06]I'm running out of gas.
[201:27.48]He's dead.
[201:37.19]Ugh.
[201:43.81]I was trying to get to the hospital to kill the guy.
[201:46.26]Damn it.
[201:52.06]Alright, let me go pee.
[201:52.89]Let me take a break.
[201:56.20]This next person I'm making is going to be
[202:01.41]the most law-abiding...
[202:03.58]I'm going to make the ultimate dork that doesn't do anything, is always telling on people, is always doing the right thing.
[202:09.92]I'm going to be...
[202:10.83]Like, Good Boy Gary or something.
[202:14.51]Good Boy Greg.
[202:16.94]I'm going to be Greg Good Boy.
[202:18.47]This character's coming up.
[202:22.15]Have a great day.
[205:06.67]Alright, so who do we want to replace?
[205:12.30]How about this guy?
[205:14.63]Alright, everybody wants you to be so small.
[205:20.06]I'm gonna have a really good reputation.
[205:21.31]I don't need to be strong at all.
[205:23.70]We can be totally weak.
[205:24.69]We'll use our brain.
[205:43.50]What does skill directly corroborate with?
[205:48.06]What does it mean?
[205:57.85]Avoid conflict with do max rep.
[206:02.96]It lowers attitude.
[206:11.13]Um...
[206:14.66]I'll do 95 stamina.
[206:17.36]I want at least 90% reputation.
[206:21.12]We should just max it out.
[206:26.38]85 skill.
[206:29.89]91% stamina.
[206:32.13]And I'm just gonna be the ultimate good boy.
[206:55.58]Okay, goodest, goodest boy.
[207:08.98]It's not even possible to be under 74 pounds.
[207:10.93]Look at this.
[207:11.45]This is the minimum weight you can pick.
[207:24.31]That's fine.
[207:33.07]I like it.
[207:45.07]That looks good.
[207:53.71]This one's actually fine.
[207:55.28]That's Sylvester Stallone?
[208:14.47]I feel like half of these are actors.
[208:32.54]Oh, that's good.
[208:33.83]Alright, mail one.
[208:35.95]Mail one, mail three.
[208:43.58]Seven's good too, though.
[208:45.47]I think it might have to be nine.
[208:46.52]Look at this.
[208:59.96]Yep.
[209:02.41]No, no, maybe glasses.
[209:07.83]No, definitely that.
[209:13.31]No, no, no, no.
[209:14.22]What would the, what would the goodest boy wear?
[209:18.15]It'd just be glasses.
[209:25.71]Okay.
[209:33.57]He needs to be in a suit with like a collar.
[209:51.14]Hey, what about...
[210:20.46]It's like a nice bright color.
[210:24.62]Like big bright blue.
[210:29.86]Just put him in all in white.
[210:32.69]Mr. Angel.
[210:34.42]Okay, yeah, that's definitely like a bright white suit.
[210:37.69]That's so awful to look at though.
[210:44.71]Okay.
[211:05.21]No, no gloves.
[211:11.85]What about under pattern?
[211:12.87]We need a better shirt than that.
[211:28.33]That's better.
[211:28.77]A little too sleazy looking though.
[211:30.61]I need something better under.
[212:11.19]Goodness.
[212:39.49]How about a pair of jeans?
[212:42.24]Yeah, light jeans.
[212:45.86]Yeah.
[212:46.30]100%, yes.
[212:55.06]Perfect.
[212:57.16]Okay, there it is.
[212:57.72]There's Mr. Good Boy, whatever his name is.
[213:11.33]Alright, it needs to be like a slap.
[213:12.65]Yeah.
[213:13.65]Slap.
[213:24.09]Big boot.
[213:25.54]No.
[213:30.76]The shove.
[213:32.21]That's pretty good.
[213:40.64]Super kick.
[213:48.69]Good.
[213:49.60]Alright, the stomp is gonna be...
[213:55.75]Punch.
[213:57.26]Big Crush will be Frog Splash.
[214:01.12]Running Crush will be Double Stomp.
[214:05.67]He's ready.
[214:16.23]Godest boy, this court has seen you accused of ruining Disney.
[214:19.91]29 days.
[214:35.81]Alright, you know the drill.
[214:40.45]I'm going to only be good when never going to do anything bad.
[214:48.13]Is that the lawyer or is that me?
[214:53.04]Attention, MeStrong has been found dead.
[215:01.17]His death is thought to be related to a dispute with Julie Hines, who is now wanted for questioning.
[215:11.47]Although my hands, my arms are pink.
[215:13.33]I thought it was white.
[215:15.08]Okay, well, whatever.
[215:15.76]Here we are.
[215:16.31]I'm Mr. Good Boy.
[215:17.37]Hello there.
[215:18.42]Hi.
[215:18.86]Hello, fellow prisoner.
[215:25.22]Alright, good boy.
[215:26.14]That's you processed.
[215:27.57]You're in prisoner eight.
[215:29.67]Excellent.
[215:32.41]And can I just say, officer, it has been a pleasure to have you been arrested by you.
[215:35.68]8 and 20?
[215:38.27]Absolutely.
[215:38.81]I will make sure I'm in that cell at between 8 and 20.
[215:45.47]I'll make sure to stay out of trouble.
[215:47.05]Don't worry about me.
[215:53.87]Oh, what's on the ground here?
[215:57.08]Oh, I think that may have been somebody's fecal matter.
[215:59.90]That's okay.
[216:00.55]I can just wash my hands.
[216:04.32]Look at this picture down here.
[216:06.07]Oh, that's a beautiful picture.
[216:07.27]Let me rehang it.
[216:11.81]Oh, looks like I couldn't find the command strip that I could have put on there.
[216:16.38]Hello, neighbor.
[216:17.02]How are you?
[216:23.88]Oh, you see, you dropped a key here.
[216:27.03]Let me return that back to the police station where it belongs.
[216:34.86]Ah, boy, these stairs.
[216:39.21]A whole lot of steps in this one.
[216:48.13]Jeez, you get winded just going up the first few.
[216:52.40]Hello, cameras.
[216:53.12]Hi, how are you?
[216:55.21]Just returning something that lost and found.
[217:00.24]Oh, hello there.
[217:00.98]Yeah, that's a great painting.
[217:07.41]Something you want to say to me, goodest?
[217:10.84]huh well I I do have any advice
[217:22.01]Do you know that you can adjust the camera with the D-pad?
[217:25.67]That's not really blocking very much.
[217:29.39]Oh, I did not know about the D-pad.
[217:32.98]What was I?
[217:33.78]What number was I in?
[217:35.49]Oops, don't.
[217:36.09]I gotta be careful on that.
[217:37.56]You could fall and enter your leg.
[217:43.14]A light jog will do.
[217:47.63]Why aren't you wearing your prison colors?
[217:49.10]Get changed before you get in trouble!
[217:52.23]Wait.
[217:55.41]What do you mean, my prison colors?
[217:56.59]This is my outfit.
[218:02.26]Officer, this seems to be a misunderstanding of the law here.
[218:06.54]The law clearly states that I can have some civilian clothing on.
[218:09.55]Officer, what are you doing?
[218:12.02]Oh!
[218:16.52]What?
[218:16.84]I can't even be good?
[218:29.39]I'm in trouble for having different clothes on!
[218:31.42]Is that even...
[218:37.68]Why give the customization opposite?
[218:39.92]With so many different colors around the prison, isn't it clear what I'm supposed to be wearing?
[218:45.36]It's not even clear.
[218:55.01]What the fuck?!
[218:59.45]It's important that everybody knows you're a prisoner, including yourself.
[219:02.67]Well, I did not know the law, and now I do.
[219:09.11]Okay, I will change into appropriate attire.
[219:16.46]Hmm.
[219:20.27]Wait, I can't even...
[219:21.11]I can't.
[219:21.51]I wish I had this glass pane.
[219:28.80]Well, um...
[219:30.88]You can keep it.
[219:32.81]It's broken, so maybe you could get use out of it.
[219:35.96]My glass paint isn't good enough for you?
[219:37.51]I should beat you to death with it.
[219:41.31]Well, that would be a show of violence, which is not the way that things to be done in a prison.
[219:49.06]Look, I'll clean it up for you.
[219:51.78]Karma finally caught up to you, good boy.
[219:53.54]Perhaps now you'll think twice about your behavior.
[219:56.78]Well, I actually didn't do anything.
[219:58.53]I just wore clothing that they did not like.
[220:04.48]So I'm going to go change.
[220:18.62]Oh, dear.
[220:19.59]Oh, dear.
[220:20.85]I'm trying to change.
[220:24.12]Oh, please don't hurt me.
[220:25.65]Please don't hurt me.
[220:28.60]Somebody broke the law over here, officer, and they...
[220:38.01]Can you...
[220:47.80]I just... Can you give me some money?
[220:58.38]Dude, this character's dead.
[221:01.14]You didn't get a chance to RP.
[221:06.30]I'm being killed right now.
[221:08.06]She's killing him.
[221:12.46]I'm dying in the menu.
[221:27.34]I'm just trying to be a good boy!
[221:29.15]Will anybody get her off me?
[221:36.38]Why are you getting smaller?
[221:46.56]This is fucking twisted.
[221:52.12]Uh, could you protect me?
[221:56.14]Got your back, good boy!
[221:57.35]I'll go wherever you go!
[221:58.46]Uh, like, right now?
[222:04.48]Listen, good boy, I'm supposed to arrest you for impersonation.
[222:11.28]But since I'm so merciful, I could be persuaded to overlook it for 40 bucks.
[222:17.20]Oh, dear.
[222:17.97]Oh, my goodness.
[222:19.14]Alright, fine.
[222:19.67]Take the $40.
[222:20.67]Just please let go of me.
[222:23.48]Thanks for your generous donation.
[222:24.89]I can't even remember what I was supposed to arrest you for, dweeb.
[222:32.16]Hey!
[222:32.88]What the hell?
[222:33.64]Help me!
[222:35.75]Don't worry, good boy.
[222:36.80]I'll take care of Greg McMahon for you.
[222:39.07]Well, I would appreciate it if you would just not stand by the exit.
[222:44.19]he's dead
[222:51.85]I was saved by Ali Buna.
[223:02.50]I want the record to show on this stream that everybody that told me
[223:08.20]Dude, you're just like, why are you not doing anything?
[223:10.96]Why are you not following things?
[223:12.37]Why are you not doing the quest?
[223:13.96]I made a new character and took three steps before I was arrested twice for having clothing on.
[223:23.57]Well that settles it then.
[223:31.78]Okay.
[223:32.92]Yeah, we'll never be friends.
[223:33.87]That's fine.
[223:35.60]Okay.
[223:35.97]Well, I need a doctor.
[223:38.85]Why aren't you wearing your prison colors?
[223:41.41]Oh my God.
[223:42.44]Well, I'm on my way to the wardrobe, but I keep getting stopped.
[223:49.76]Uh, excuse me, doctor, I could use a little bit of attention, please.
[223:53.00]I've got a really bad headache.
[223:55.59]It's so bad.
[223:56.86]Oh, no!
[223:59.20]Oh no, I'm being arrested for impersonating somebody again.
[224:02.27]I just, I just, I need a doctor.
[224:05.15]You know what, sometimes a good voice snaps.
[224:14.57]This court has convened to hear the case against- I can't even make it to the wardrobe.
[224:34.82]This is a massive boo.
[224:36.31]I need to head to the wardrobe.
[224:42.99]Why am I holding... Am I missing a finger?
[224:47.83]I think my character is in the middle of dying.
[224:50.66]But it teleported me here.
[224:56.32]There we go, finally, some good luck for the good boy.
[224:59.01]Does that mean I get, like, a pass to do this now?
[225:10.63]The world is rigged against good boys.
[225:13.86]That's true.
[225:15.33]Okay, I need to go to the wardrobe.
[225:17.00]I'm gonna die, but I need to go there first.
[225:19.05]I thought you were dead, good boy.
[225:20.80]You won't be so lucky next time.
[225:22.21]Alright, well, let me just...
[225:23.08]I need to lay down.
[225:25.68]Stop talking to me!
[225:27.21]Stop, please!
[225:28.49]No!
[225:37.12]Okay, now he's dead.
[225:42.14]I can't, I, what the hell?
[225:47.26]Everybody hates the good boy.
[225:48.99]I thought my reputation was 100.
[225:51.67]I did 99.
[225:55.75]I did 99 for reputation and everybody hated me!
[225:59.23]Apparently I had more friends than anybody else!
[226:07.67]What is going on?
[226:15.77]Um...
[226:18.33]I... Well, now I'm making his brother.
[226:20.10]This is hor... That's horseshit.
[226:24.88]That's actual dog shit.
[226:26.78]Okay.
[226:31.06]And I'll put him in a prison outfit, apparently.
[226:52.20]the baddest boy?
[226:53.39]No, I want to be a good boy.
[227:01.97]Goodest boy, gooder boy.
[227:28.01]I can't believe that happened.
[227:34.33]Okay, what was the hair again?
[227:37.61]was this one it was pulled back it was a different color it was like
[227:46.67]That's fine.
[227:48.36]What face was it?
[227:55.02]Is this one here?
[228:04.53]100% friendly.
[228:11.36]Okay, now, let's go ahead and put on the right outfit!
[228:19.65]How is being naked?
[228:21.82]I don't understand that.
[228:22.69]So my second character was naked and that was fine.
[228:48.38]What is considered a prison attire then?
[228:56.87]Like, is this okay?
[229:00.21]Or does it have to be one of the first few?
[229:01.70]It needs to be the orange jumpsuit.
[229:08.74]It just needs to be orange.
[229:49.15]That's okay.
[229:49.65]There you go.
[229:50.02]Fine.
[229:51.66]Legs.
[229:53.94]Just make it orange.
[230:05.00]Chat is dumb.
[230:05.83]It's based on cell block.
[230:13.47]It's the cell block color.
[230:23.63]The what?
[230:29.85]You don't get your block until you're in.
[230:31.65]So I would need to...
[230:32.25]Okay, so if I get called out on this again, I need to change.
[230:41.36]Some sublocks are orange, others are green.
[230:43.66]Okay.
[230:54.04]I'm just going for it.
[231:06.52]Alright, let's go.
[231:11.12]Gooder boy, this court has seen you accused of sleeping.
[231:16.53]Your character started green.
[231:18.83]Oh no, are you serious?
[231:26.84]So I have to go change into green outfit like right now.
[231:42.96]It actually might be orange.
[231:45.55]No, East Block is orange.
[231:47.40]Attention, Goodest Boy has been found... dead.
[231:53.74]His death is thought to be related to a dispute with Mindy Jarden, who is now wanted for questioning.
[232:01.43]Till then, our thoughts are with his friends and family who also just happen to have been arrested.
[232:05.20]I've got tattoos all over me.
[232:11.78]Well, I mean... You're an E-10!
[232:22.90]Okay, that sounds good to me.
[232:24.06]Thank you for telling me where to go.
[232:30.04]Don't worry, this place is only as bad as you make it.
[232:37.65]Yeah, my brother was just in here, and he may have been a stickler for the rules, but I am also one of those rule sticklers.
[232:48.60]but I have a little bit more street smarts than he did.
[232:53.00]If you think I'm sharing my shell with you, then you better get used to sleeping on the floor.
[232:59.99]Well, there could be bugs on the floor, so I'm not going to be doing that, but I will take your feedback.
[233:13.61]You're supposed to be green, dude?
[233:15.29]Oh, fuck.
[233:15.96]I gotta go to the wardrobe.
[233:43.66]How green?
[233:48.94]Like how green is green?
[233:53.16]Is this green enough?
[233:57.97]Like very green.
[234:39.52]There.
[234:39.84]There we go.
[234:44.98]Now I fit in with everybody.
[234:47.14]Ooh, a delicious piece of watermelon on the floor.
[235:03.13]I've had enough of this!
[235:04.57]Give me that flamethrower!
[235:15.56]I'm getting out of here.
[235:17.14]Gooder boy is getting out tomorrow.
[235:25.71]Goodaboy's getting out and he's going to the arcade.
[235:30.92]Just put him in the default prison jumpsuit.
[235:32.89]I don't even know how to do that.
[235:42.28]You need numbers on your back?
[235:50.85]Hey, alright.
[235:51.98]I'm getting out.
[235:52.50]I'm literally climbing the fence right now.
[235:54.51]I don't care what I'm, I'm getting out of prison.
[235:56.82]I'm going to get a key and I'm walking out the front door and I'm getting a car.
[235:58.81]I'm leaving.
[236:03.30]I'm gonna act like I have six stars in GTA.
[236:07.06]I'm going to...
[236:07.92]Here we go.
[236:08.42]Just get out.
[236:09.77]Find a key on the ground.
[236:16.50]There's always a key just sitting on the ground.
[236:20.56]Yeah, whatever.
[236:23.31]I don't care.
[236:33.39]Thank you.
[236:39.08]Gooder boy is now evolving into bad boy.
[236:43.77]Kind of accurate.
[236:47.18]Yeah.
[236:47.67]I'm gonna ch- Oh, I'll change, alright.
[236:49.03]Okay.
[236:52.75]I'm just going over the fence.
[236:55.18]I don't see a key anywhere.
[237:03.04]You're too skinny.
[237:03.99]You're gonna make me go, what?
[237:05.51]I need to be 95 pounds or else.
[237:16.96]I need a key.
[237:18.65]Or I'm just climbing up.
[237:21.12]I'm just climbing over the fence.
[237:22.58]Fuck it.
[237:22.94]Let's get out of here.
[237:23.65]Gooder... Gooder boy is making a run for it.
[237:30.72]Head out to the yard.
[237:31.46]Oh, shut up.
[238:02.31]Okay, there's one guy here.
[238:03.56]He's really cold.
[238:05.79]I think I'm gonna be able to make it.
[238:16.78]Not so good anymore, am I?
[238:20.84]So long, suckers!
[238:37.25]No, no one would be at the airport!
[238:51.23]Where the hell am I going?
[238:55.17]I can get on the plane now?
[238:56.13]Oh my god, I can.
[239:05.37]How many people got in the car?
[239:09.62]I took the whole prison with me.
[239:11.03]The entire prison's got here.
[239:12.71]Let's get on the plane quick.
[239:16.00]You fucking idiots!
[239:17.18]Please get out of the way.
[239:20.16]Oh my god, I made it on the plane!
[239:27.76]You can't stop me.
[239:28.48]I'll take these drugs.
[239:40.11]Alright.
[239:41.28]Wouldn't it be great if we could share a cell, gooder boy?
[239:43.62]Why don't you join me?
[239:50.00]You know, I would love to move to your cell.
[239:51.97]That sounds wonderful.
[240:02.41]Okay.
[240:03.99]To Mexico!
[240:04.64]What should I go by in Mexico?
[240:08.46]I'm thinking if I'm good or boy...
[240:11.33]Maybe I could change my name.
[240:13.28]What is gooder boy in Spanish?
[240:15.99]Bueno boy.
[240:19.99]Bueno...
[240:21.29]Niño Bueno.
[240:27.11]Oh, I'm sorry.
[240:27.64]You can have your seat back.
[240:28.62]It is I, Niño Bueno.
[240:44.86]I really have to use the bathroom.
[240:48.70]Oh!
[240:49.46]I made it!
[240:49.89]I made it to Mexico!
[240:56.05]El Niño Bueno is finally here!
[241:07.73]Freedom!
[241:10.38]I did this all for my brother.
[241:11.79]Goodest boy.
[241:12.78]Oh, now there's a Canadian guy after me in Mexico.
[241:18.55]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, please, no!
[241:24.36]No!
[241:49.02]So many people just got arrested.
[241:53.54]I was not pretending to be a police officer.
[241:55.27]I was trying to run away.
[242:00.38]I was just trying to fulfill my dream of joining the Force.
[242:09.16]Change your clothes.
[242:11.28]Okay, apparently...
[242:13.89]Thank you.
[242:15.01]Appreciate that, Judge.
[242:16.75]Uh, the colors have to be correct.
[242:18.80]It's 95, 55, 10 for North.
[242:20.97]40, 50, 20 for South, 25, 40.
[242:23.24]How the hell was I going to know this?
[242:30.30]Alright, what?
[242:32.55]I'm in, am I in east block?
[242:34.64]So I need 40, 50, 20.
[242:49.06]Change the actual clothing, too.
[242:50.67]I'm not gonna get arrested in here, alright?
[242:59.59]It's not the color.
[243:00.88]It's that you're wearing something that counts as a police officer uniform.
[243:16.57]Pick the first outfit in every category.
[243:27.89]These are police glasses?
[243:31.04]That'd be so funny.
[243:51.16]Try cloning and copy someone's outfit.
[243:54.64]I mean, if I can make it to the wardrobe, I should be fine.
[243:58.11]Well...
[243:59.44]I still am gonna try to get there.
[244:09.78]fucked up.
[244:15.11]I can't believe they dragged your ass all the way here from Mexico to charge you with impersonation and lose the case.
[244:26.33]Alright, I think I'm just going to restart.
[244:29.69]We're going all out when I wake up.
[244:41.97]That's fine.
[244:44.52]I'm going all in.
[244:46.09]We'll go in absolute mayhem mode when I wake up.
[244:49.00]You just turned the gooder boy.
[244:52.87]into a bad man.
[245:10.56]Open those up.
[245:19.06]Yeah.
[245:20.10]Say hello to El Nino Bueno.
[245:34.44]Get out of here!
[245:39.35]Okay.
[245:41.56]So you're saying just do one for every category?
[245:50.80]Like this?
[246:07.23]Take those cop pants off.
[246:16.64]Like that?
[246:17.08]Check cloning.
[246:23.83]Wait, what about restore default?
[246:29.33]That's weird.
[246:30.18]Okay, that's the default apparently.
[246:40.66]You thought you could match with me.
[246:48.01]I like the new tattoo, Gooder Boy.
[246:49.64]Maybe I should get one like that.
[246:51.52]It's not Gooder Boy anymore.
[246:53.39]It's Bad Man.
[246:57.28]So, Henry...
[246:59.89]What do you say you and I get into business together?
[247:07.00]El niño, what is it?
[247:09.21]El Niño Mano.
[247:10.97]What is it?
[247:12.78]El Niño.
[247:13.44]El Niño Malo.
[247:16.09]That's me.
[247:17.79]Don't forget that either.
[247:20.45]I'm getting out now.
[247:43.95]What have you done to yourself, good or boy?
[247:45.30]You look like an unfu.
[247:46.55]What's that?
[247:48.92]Khloé Ra has been imprisoned.
[247:52.88]Okay.
[247:55.41]El Niño Malo.
[247:57.25]Revenge.
[248:01.13]I need to pee first.
[248:20.64]It's time to...
[248:33.92]Oh, I shot the wrong guy.
[248:35.49]I'm getting out of here.
[248:51.64]Oh, we're shooting.
[248:58.93]Get me out!
[249:06.02]What is going on?
[249:08.78]Oh my god, I just I shot them, okay.
[249:24.46]Oh, even the police aren't safe.
[249:26.21]The wards are always starting fights.
[249:27.69]They only complain when they lose.
[249:29.42]Or if I shoot at them.
[249:31.59]Come on.
[249:39.23]Is it possible to have a complete takeover?
[249:41.14]There probably is.
[249:58.94]Alright, I'm going to take a quick break.
[250:00.92]We'll end this arc when I get back.
[250:06.46]But I'm going to take a break.
[250:07.95]I'll be back.
[250:08.27]I'm going to pee.
[250:08.67]I'm going to take care of Otto.
[250:10.54]And I'll be back in like five-ish minutes.
[250:13.19]Maybe a little bit less.
[250:15.08]I'll be right back.
[250:18.26]We will finish out Gooder Boy's arc, don't worry.
[250:21.57]Be right back.
[263:30.39]Hello, I'm back.
[263:37.71]Sorry, that took a little longer than I thought.
[263:40.55]Auto needs a little bit of extra time these days.
[263:43.12]As I'm sure you're probably acutely aware.
[263:49.12]But he's good.
[263:49.76]He was hungry and he needed to go outside.
[263:53.47]But he's doing just fine.
[263:56.46]But I should be able to finish up this good boy arc.
[264:02.55]Yeah, right, dude.
[264:03.07]I bet you were vaping.
[264:15.63]Alright.
[264:16.51]What was I doing?
[264:19.00]Oh, that's right.
[264:24.44]Did I break my leg?
[264:33.82]Alright, I wanna go... to the hospital.
[264:37.20]Get fully geared.
[264:40.15]Is that a camera?
[264:48.37]Anyone who gets in my way will regret it.
[264:51.14]He's a gun.
[264:57.43]Shoot into the camera?
[265:04.45]I want to go to the hospital.
[265:12.84]And I want to gear up.
[265:16.07]And then I'm making another...
[265:16.83]I want to get in a car.
[265:18.46]But this time I don't want to just drive right to the airport and then go to the beach.
[265:25.26]Oh, don't.
[265:26.32]Why are you putting this here?
[265:30.23]I mean, I need to know, right?
[265:31.90]I need to know.
[265:34.22]You know who we're looking for.
[265:45.74]We're looking for Hodge.
[265:57.66]If he's even still here, honestly.
[266:11.12]Not here Excuse me
[266:22.75]The Texas Good Boy Massacre.
[266:27.02]No, sorry.
[266:27.56]It's the Texas El Niño Malo Bueno Massacre.
[266:32.74]Because that's me!
[266:39.20]Is that you?
[266:39.75]Wait, I don't like this guy either.
[266:42.63]Do we save it for Hodge?
[266:53.14]If I can even find them.
[267:01.65]I do need to go to the hospital and get full health.
[267:04.38]This is a full health scenario and I'm just gonna sit in the corner.
[267:09.31]I'm just going to literally me grind anybody that comes near me.
[267:21.96]I have not seen him.
[267:27.52]Do me a favor?
[267:34.01]Why don't you show us your skills by scoring a basket?
[267:37.29]I can do that.
[267:37.97]That's simple.
[267:38.81]Yeah, sure.
[267:43.51]I'm taking this chainsaw with me everywhere I go, though.
[267:51.51]This character is so slow.
[267:53.77]It's unbelievable.
[268:00.67]How much is a full heal?
[268:17.18]Uh, can you prescribe me painkillers?
[268:20.58]I think it was like, okay, 15 bucks.
[268:22.36]I'm doing it.
[268:24.01]Bring me back to full health and I'm going all in.
[268:26.85]I'm gonna get the backpack on.
[268:30.60]Yeah, we're going full backpack.
[268:33.68]Backpack on.
[268:35.94]Geared up.
[268:37.75]Drank up.
[268:38.45]Juiced up.
[268:40.90]Full heal.
[268:41.83]I'm gonna keep the health pack.
[268:43.20]Can I put it in the backpack?
[268:51.47]Okay.
[268:52.78]I'm ready.
[268:56.10]Let me pee in the toilet first.
[269:03.26]and head to the visitor center.
[269:07.35]Wait, there's drugs.
[269:08.53]Give those to me.
[269:12.85]Alright, I'm ready.
[269:32.19]So you're telling me I wanted to get this right.
[269:35.94]If I...
[269:37.20]If I climb up here, I can get out.
[269:40.05]But isn't it locked, isn't it?
[269:44.25]Isn't the front door locked?
[269:48.35]Maybe somebody else will break it because they're going crazy.
[269:59.85]That's Hodge?
[270:00.75]Where?
[270:05.25]Uh, what?
[270:05.77]Did I shit?
[270:07.30]I thought I already took a shit.
[270:08.46]Oh, I peed.
[270:10.22]Okay, I'll put it down.
[270:11.03]Put it down.
[270:11.33]Put it down.
[270:12.03]It's down.
[270:12.49]I put it down.
[270:14.04]I put it in the backpack.
[270:15.02]Does that count?
[270:19.09]No, put it away.
[270:22.10]He's too weak to lift a chair.
[270:23.69]That is embarrassing.
[270:26.51]I'm waiting for- okay, there's a- oh boy, there's a gun right here.
[270:30.13]I'm waiting for somebody to have a- like a meltdown and break- okay.
[270:34.47]You're in here for impersonating.
[270:35.46]I'm in here for snacking.
[270:40.80]Oh, well, that's okay.
[270:43.07]I'm sorry to hear that.
[270:48.24]Okay, maybe he'll do it.
[270:50.98]We need somebody to break...
[270:55.32]Phone.
[270:57.24]Where's that phone?
[271:01.05]Who is it?
[271:04.66]It's not this phone.
[271:06.91]How?
[271:09.24]Oh, fuck!
[271:10.38]Okay, I, uh, I, I, I, I, right, right, right, I, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, let's go.
[271:20.19]I don't care about shooting a basketball right now.
[271:22.96]Give me that.
[271:23.41]That's a better gun.
[271:26.36]El niño bueno.
[271:36.40]You fucking idiots!
[271:37.73]You're both so stupid!
[271:38.98]Why are there all these animals?
[271:40.71]Why are there all these animals?
[271:45.60]Oh my god, it's mayhem out on the street here.
[271:49.72]Please leave me alone.
[271:50.64]Aren't we all on the same team?
[271:52.16]Why is it just a crazy town out here?
[272:00.99]You shouldn't be carrying a rifle.
[272:02.19]I... Yeah.
[272:02.82]I...
[272:17.44]How have I not been spotted yet?
[272:23.19]Are you sure you want to walk out with that backpack?
[272:25.09]It'll cost you $50!
[272:29.73]Uh... You know what?
[272:36.01]I'll put the... Just drive the fucking car, dude.
[272:47.35]And apparently I killed a horse.
[272:51.80]You... Why is it on the ground?
[272:54.07]Who cares about the backpack?
[272:56.22]Just get me out of here.
[273:02.45]Okay, I wanna- where do I wanna go?
[273:03.71]There's the subway, the grocery store, the arcade, the cinema.
[273:08.57]I wanna go to the cinema.
[273:09.49]No, the arcade.
[273:11.90]The pool, the gym.
[273:13.58]How could... Why is...
[273:17.13]How are you supposed to get this so much video game out here?
[273:20.26]How are you supposed to get out here?
[273:31.27]I think I just killed somebody.
[273:41.57]I think I'm scared of somebody that has Dr.
[273:45.76]Dash as a backup friend.
[273:48.27]I want to go to the arcade, but I don't want to get in trouble.
[273:50.46]Putting the car in a perfect spot.
[273:55.93]Alright, get out.
[273:58.28]I wanna play one round of, like, fuckin' Donkey Kong.
[274:06.36]Oh, you've gotta be fucking kidding me.
[274:08.70]And it was this dickhead that got me.
[274:22.25]They were camping.
[274:24.47]I'm finding Officer Hodge and I'm running him over with a motorcycle.
[274:32.17]You can be a civilian.
[274:35.65]How do you start the game as a civilian?
[274:44.90]Yeah, it has to be unlocked.
[274:46.05]Oh.
[274:52.36]This game is crazy.
[274:54.73]I actually might return to this.
[274:58.61]But I'm probably going to call it here.
[275:05.98]There's too much going on in this game to not do something else.
[275:12.89]Everybody knows what you did to Lacey Spencer.
[275:14.69]What did I do?
[275:18.16]Oh, I have no control of the character.
[275:25.27]Oh, that's the person I ran over with the car.
[275:26.99]Okay.
[275:32.03]You know what?
[275:37.86]Oh, he's right there.
[275:38.54]Hold on a second.
[275:39.68]He's right there.
[275:49.51]I want justice.
[275:53.07]Should have known you couldn't be reasoned with.
[275:54.37]That won't be the last time you end up in trouble.
[275:59.71]Just wait till I get out.
[276:01.29]Just wait till it's daytime.
[276:11.33]Alright, whatever happens at the end of this day, that's going to be it.
[276:16.02]And then I'll be live again.
[276:17.11]I actually think I'm only going to go live for like 10 minutes as a joke.
[276:21.21]So I get to 100 streams for 2025.
[276:23.90]So don't be surprised if you see me live for literally five minutes.
[276:30.24]Thanks for the gun.
[276:33.42]Thanks for the gun.
[276:38.75]What am I doing?
[276:47.26]I...
[276:48.06]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[276:49.81]Stop.
[276:50.58]I don't want anything to do with you.
[277:00.79]Fuck you!
[277:02.93]Shoot him!
[277:04.82]I don't want to shoot you!
[277:10.75]Fuck you, officer!
[277:12.70]Oh my god.
[277:15.35]No, I know I'm not supposed to- Oh my fuck.
[277:27.12]Why did it explode?
[277:28.55]Officer Hodge, you are such a dick.
[277:37.63]Why did the gun explode?
[277:41.59]I had beef with nobody but Hodge.
[277:43.82]He's the only one.
[277:44.72]The only one I ever...
[277:46.47]Think about how many times I've opened a door and he has unloaded a machine gun on me for literally no reason.
[277:51.65]Just because I opened the door.
[277:54.44]It's the only one I had beef with.
[278:05.53]Alright, we'll pick it up probably sooner than you think, because I think this was really fun.
[278:12.37]I'll just pick up right where you left off.
[278:15.23]The arch nemesis, Officer Hodge.
[278:23.61]But yeah.
[278:23.97]I'm glad I played it.
[278:24.95]It's been on the back burner for a long time.
[278:30.36]But that's going to be it.
[278:33.67]Thanks for sticking around.
[278:34.47]Thanks for hanging out.
[278:36.24]I will see you guys in a few days or in two days, right?
[278:41.66]I might just go live and play this for an hour.
[278:44.81]Just to be like, haha, look, 100.
[278:49.33]It'll be in the title, so don't worry.
[278:50.56]It'll say this stream is only going to be one hour long.
[278:56.79]or less.
[279:05.21]Take care of yourselves.
[279:06.14]Thanks for watching.
[279:06.84]Game was hilarious.
[279:08.41]It's just as crazy as I thought it was going to be.
[279:10.10]It is by the same person that made Wrestling Empire, so it makes sense.
[279:14.80]Call your mother.
[279:15.44]See you later.
[279:16.45]Have a great rest of your day.
[279:20.47]See you soon.
[279:24.58]Yeah, Happy New Year.
[279:25.33]I will be live on New Year's Eve, which is this is what I'm talking about.
[279:29.63]So.
[279:32.26]I don't think I'm going to be live for the ball dropping, though.
[279:36.87]But I'll see you soon.
[279:40.17]Take it easy.
