[00:00.78]Comedy Central TV time.
[00:03.14]Ay-yay-yay.
[00:05.02]God damn it.
[00:07.16]You guys have no idea.
[00:10.16]I'll wait a little bit for people to come in for me to tell this story.
[00:14.86]Because to understand the end of the story, you have to understand the beginning.
[00:22.29]What is Guitar-O-Man?
[00:23.41]Ooh, you're in for a treat and so am I. Because I ain't ever played it either.
[00:29.88]And this is the ORIGINAL Guitar-O-Man.
[00:35.54]That's supposed to be the title.
[00:37.58]The ORIGINAL Guitar-O-Man.
[00:44.61]This ain't no hacked copy.
[00:46.81]This ain't the remake that was on PlayStation Portable.
[00:49.85]This is the ORIGINAL Guitar-O-Man for PlayStation 2.
[01:00.07]Am I going to do a stream on Rhythm Heaven?
[01:01.77]Maybe.
[01:02.71]But I wanted to break it up a little bit today.
[01:04.79]We've been doing horror games.
[01:06.61]That scary, scream-in-your-face games.
[01:09.85]For the last, like, two weeks.
[01:13.91]So I'm like, you know... It's time to break it up and do something a little more light-hearted.
[01:20.47]So today... We are going to do... Guitar-O-Man...
[01:26.78]And then tomorrow, we're going to do the new Trine with Star and Ashley.
[01:34.42]I believe that's what's happening tomorrow.
[01:39.92]So, we're gonna lighten it up a little bit.
[01:42.94]And then after that, we're gonna go to The Thing.
[01:47.63]We've got a whole plan for this next week or two straight.
[01:55.13]Yes, The Thing.
[02:00.25]What thing?
[02:01.45]THE thing.
[02:03.73]THE thing.
[02:06.03]But anyways, let's have a little discussion on what happened earlier today.
[02:13.04]The three trainers, that's right.
[02:15.98]Okay, so like I said, to understand the end of the story, you have to understand the beginning.
[02:20.09]So, as a lot of you know, I've been having some issues lately.
[02:26.35]Stomach issues.
[02:27.73]I've been having stomach pain, I've been having abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, and back pain for the last probably eight months.
[02:35.27]I've had a colonoscopy, we've gone through like all kinds of stuff.
[02:40.00]I've had a colonoscopy, I'm going in for like another endoscopy of my stomach.
[02:44.60]I have to get a liver scan.
[02:46.36]We're trying to find out what the fuck is wrong with me, right?
[02:48.36]Because we don't think it's related to colitis.
[02:51.40]Whatever it is, we're trying to figure it out.
[02:53.40]So I'm on a couple of new medications, right?
[02:56.04]And these medications... Let's just lay it out there, because you have to understand.
[03:00.54]Let's lay it out there.
[03:02.16]I don't care.
[03:04.50]I, right now, we're trying to do a few things.
[03:06.82]And one of them is to do with my intestines and my stomach.
[03:10.24]Right now, I am on a prescription-grade laxative.
[03:16.66]Let's get it out there!
[03:17.46]Like, what the fuck do I care?
[03:21.45]One of the reasons why I've had to say, wait, our streams are going to be like four or five, four hours this week is because I'm actually on a literal prescription grade laxative.
[03:35.28]so that's one of the that's one of the medications I'm on we're trying something to do it's I don't even I don't I don't need to tell you why I just am anyways so I know I'm on all this new medication and I know that I have a a liver scan coming up so I have a liver scan coming up in a couple weeks actually and I woke up
[04:00.18]This morning.
[04:01.38]Seemed like a pretty normal morning, right?
[04:03.28]Yeah, everything's normal.
[04:04.41]What's going on here?
[04:06.89]Just gonna get my coffee, gonna have some fun and just stream.
[04:10.21]That sounds like, yeah, we're gonna stream today too.
[04:12.53]So, those of you that know anything about liver problems, there is a certain condition that can come, that can arise when you have a pretty, a liver issue.
[04:25.41]One of those things is yellowing of the skin.
[04:27.79]It's called jaundice.
[04:29.81]So I woke up this morning and I didn't look in the mirror.
[04:33.12]I hadn't taken like a shower yet.
[04:34.42]I was making coffee.
[04:35.58]I was up and down the stairs.
[04:37.76]So about like an hour and a half or so before I was going to start the stream, I look in the mirror and I noticed that my skin is yellow.
[04:46.46]Like under my arms was bright Crayola yellow.
[04:52.46]And I'm going, no, this is, that's, that's jaundice, right?
[04:58.06]I'm on this new medication.
[04:59.90]Is it the new medicine?
[05:01.37]Oh, okay, I gotta figure this out.
[05:03.21]What the fuck is happening?
[05:04.73]So, I call Kim, and I'm like, Kim, I just want to let you know, I'm probably, I gotta go to the doctor.
[05:10.67]I'm not sure if this is something to do maybe with the liver thing that we were talking about, me and the doctor.
[05:16.51]So I gotta go get something done.
[05:19.39]I gotta get my blood work or something.
[05:20.85]Okay, so that's what's gonna happen.
[05:24.14]Just want to make sure I'm okay, everything's fine.
[05:25.62]And I'm about to literally go to the ER.
[05:31.72]Like I was gonna go to the ER.
[05:33.86]Because all the doctor's offices are closed on the weekends.
[05:36.34]By the way, why the fuck is that a thing?
[05:38.26]Why are doctor's offices closed on the weekend?
[05:42.12]What?
[05:42.90]What if you have a problem?
[05:45.25]But anyways, so I'm like getting ready to go with my yellow skin.
[05:53.25]And I stop for a second.
[05:55.32]And I take a wet wipe.
[06:02.50]And I start to wipe hard on the places that are yellow.
[06:09.77]And it's coming off.
[06:12.77]My skin was dyed yellow from a bath I took yesterday.
[06:21.30]I took a bath last night and put it in something like an essential oil thing.
[06:29.82]And it was green.
[06:34.89]It was from a bath bomb.
[06:36.61]It was turmeric oil.
[06:43.75]But you have to understand something.
[06:48.13]I've been told we need to check your liver.
[06:51.86]Your abdominal pain could be because you might have an enlarged liver.
[06:56.30]And liver jaundice.
[06:58.88]And my brain, I'm just going, this has to be it.
[07:07.51]So I dyed my skin yellow accidentally last night, taking a bath bomb bath.
[07:15.69]But it wasn't there.
[07:17.05]It was not there.
[07:20.67]I didn't get out of the bath and I wasn't like yellow.
[07:25.07]I woke up yellow.
[07:26.39]I didn't go to bed yellow.
[07:34.51]Can you imagine if I had gone to the doctor?
[07:39.54]Yes, what is it, Mr. Appleton?
[07:41.36]You've got some jaundice there.
[07:44.16]Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
[07:45.08]I would give him the whole story.
[07:47.10]Yeah, we're trying to figure it out.
[07:48.34]Me and my regular doctor, we're trying to figure out, like, I'm getting a liver exam, a liver scan.
[07:53.40]We think my liver might have some problem with it.
[07:56.82]I've been having abdominal pain, and this is all real.
[08:00.01]And he's like, oh, come here for a second.
[08:01.15]Let me take a look at you.
[08:01.93]Yeah, let's go.
[08:02.57]Let's put you through a bunch more tests.
[08:07.10]And he finds out that I just have yellow food coloring on me?
[08:13.47]What is that doctor gonna say to me?
[08:16.53]These medical grade wet wipes.
[08:19.65]He's gonna be like, uh, Jeremy.
[08:22.21]Did you... Are you, uh... Did you do this?
[08:27.58]Why do you have yellow food coloring on you coming to the doctor?
[08:32.55]Because if I didn't do that, it would be just as much of a surprise to me as it is to him.
[08:36.93]Or them.
[08:37.46]Whatever, right?
[08:38.74]It'd be like... I don't know.
[08:41.30]I don't know what that is.
[08:43.98]What's going on?
[08:44.90]I'm confused too.
[08:47.58]Did somebody paint me?
[08:48.74]Did somebody paint my body?
[08:51.73]I don't know.
[08:52.11]Doctor, I don't know what's going on.
[08:59.60]Imagine having to have that conversation of, like, this is, you have... That's, okay, you know when GameStop employees, uh, tell you about the crazy customer that comes in, and like, oh, it's a GameStopStories.reddit, whatever, right?
[09:15.59]I would be on the, like, doctor, like, crazy stories subreddit.
[09:20.58]Of the guy that came in with, with, like, the yellow paint on his body, telling the doctor he had jaundice.
[09:31.66]god damn it so that was my uh that was my afternoon I canceled the stream I came in here before the stream started and I canceled it I was like guys I've I've got like an issue I've got to figure out
[09:57.22]But the reason why this sucks so bad is, and I know that's like funny, but like, at the same time, I'm sitting there going, alright, so, we still gotta figure out what's wrong with me.
[10:09.83]I still have to go for those exams, you know what I mean?
[10:14.50]I still am on a prescription grade laxative, you know, that doesn't go away.
[10:25.06]But anyways, uh, so.
[10:26.72]Today we're gonna play Guitar-O-Man, that's- that was the story.
[10:38.19]He's fooling his chat live, like, I can't imagine how embarrassing that would be if I- if I actually went to the doctor.
[10:46.31]He would just take a wet- like a- like a medical grade wet wipe, and just go like that, and be like, Sir, what are you doing here?
[10:55.53]And like the cost, it would cost so much like money too.
[10:59.15]Imagine you go to the ER and it's just you had to wipe your skin with a wet wipe.
[11:03.33]Oh man.
[11:09.96]Anyways, we can move on now.
[11:11.56]I just figured I would let you guys know.
[11:13.96]That's why the stream is starting 40 minutes late.
[11:17.32]We had some huge donations come in here.
[11:20.22]We had Freddy Dread gave 10,000 bits.
[11:25.16]$100, 10,000 bits.
[11:27.53]Uh, Frigg, I can't watch the stream today, but game hard, boss.
[11:31.23]Uh-oh.
[11:33.15]This is a hard game.
[11:34.65]Okay.
[11:37.59]Thank you for the 10,000 bits, Freddy Dredd.
[11:39.42]I'll do my best.
[11:40.04]It's gonna be a relaxing stream.
[11:45.82]It's alright.
[11:46.84]And another thing, I've, like, come to, like, I've come to terms with the fact that
[11:52.39]shit like that just kind of happens to me you know it's just like you and whatever it's just another one he's telling you the game's hard yeah that's alright what's this somebody's got an image okay that's not even what I said what
[12:21.64]It's got an amazing... I misread it.
[12:24.26]They say... No, it says, uh, Frigg, I can't watch the stream today, but game hard, boss.
[12:32.36]Like, game hard?
[12:33.84]Like, game sucks.
[12:36.21]And they're calling me boss.
[12:40.75]Is this like a game hard?
[12:42.29]This game is hard?
[12:43.11]Or go for it.
[12:43.81]You game hard today.
[12:46.57]I don't know.
[12:50.13]I woke up yellow today, okay?
[12:51.71]I'm still getting over this.
[12:52.79]It was, like, very stressful.
[12:55.57]I was, like... I was, like, gonna call my mother and shit.
[12:58.39]Like, it was... This was not, like, a very good morning.
[13:06.02]That's a sentence.
[13:06.98]Oh, okay.
[13:08.12]But anyways, thank you, FreddyDread.
[13:09.28]And then thank you to Zipsil for the 10 community subs.
[13:13.52]Appreciate that.
[13:14.06]Thank you.
[13:17.56]I cannot do face cam today, because it's not plugged in.
[13:23.25]That's it.
[13:23.93]I've been doing a lot of face cam.
[13:26.11]We don't need face cam.
[13:26.99]This is a music stream.
[13:31.09]Speaking of music streams, why don't we take a look at it?
[13:37.51]And here it is.
[13:39.80]Or at least it should be there.
[13:41.38]Guitar-O-Man!
[13:42.34]Hey, yeah!
[13:43.40]I don't even know what it sounds like.
[13:44.54]What does it sound like?
[13:49.88]Why can I not hear this?
[13:51.26]Did it just stop?
[13:51.86]There we go.
[13:59.97]Alright.
[14:00.69]First things first.
[14:01.83]Like we do with every old console game.
[14:05.81]We need to test to make sure that this is synced up, okay?
[14:09.65]Here we go, you ready?
[14:10.27]1, 2, 3, 4.
[14:11.99]1, 2, 3, 4.
[14:12.63]1, 2, 3, 4.
[14:13.09]We good?
[14:22.01]Alright.
[14:24.11]So, uh, Guitar-O-Man is a game where you play the guitar and it's a rhythm game.
[14:28.17]And apparently it's a hard game, from what I've been told from some of the members of this community.
[14:32.68]Let's give it a try.
[14:38.02]We got a full motion video cutscene in the beginning, that's good.
[14:50.68]It's Snoopy!
[14:51.84]What the fuck is going on?
[14:53.56]Oh, it's gonna teach me how to play the guitar on a tennis racket.
[15:20.40]Me, when I'm on prescription grade laxatives.
[15:22.68]Alright.
[15:24.18]I'm telling you, I'm alright.
[15:26.14]I'll be completely transparent with it.
[15:30.13]Alright, guitar.
[15:36.69]What's one two?
[15:39.55]I don't have a one... Tilt your head forward.
[15:46.28]Your head, yeah.
[15:47.48]Like, give yourself a nerve neck.
[15:55.59]tilt it in any direction and spin around and round tilt your head forward relax your shoulders have bad air flow it's called the trace line yeah move the left analog stick to match the blue zone with this line when the line turns blue like this it means you're off center
[16:22.03]Wait, I actually have to use the analog?
[16:27.79]Rotate the left analog stick to follow the trace- Oh, shit.
[16:32.69]Oh, man.
[16:33.49]This is gonna be hard.
[16:34.31]This is a hard game, boss.
[16:44.91]Oh, Jesus.
[17:12.44]Okay, I'm ready.
[17:13.90]I'll try.
[17:15.24]Oh, this way.
[17:16.79]Oh shit!
[17:43.83]Come on, that's better than okay.
[17:45.50]Wait, that wasn't me doing that?
[17:47.20]I thought that was me doing that.
[17:58.82]Nice.
[18:00.84]It's Shido.
[18:01.42]Nice.
[18:10.78]I just spilled coffee literally all over my whole body.
[18:12.84]Give me a break.
[18:14.78]What a disaster.
[18:16.38]Whatever.
[18:16.98]Combat skills?
[18:17.65]What, I have like a Street Fighter meter?
[18:31.68]your timing's off, or if the trace line goes out of the blue zone, you won't gain power.
[18:36.13]You've got a battle to fight, so charge up all the power you can.
[18:39.59]Next, the battle.
[18:40.95]In the battle phase, there's the attack mode and the guard mode.
[18:43.51]You alternate between them.
[18:44.78]In attack mode, lay down the hottest rifts you can.
[18:48.26]The better you play, the more damage
[18:55.67]Oh no.
[18:56.13]Thank god this is on PlayStation controller.
[18:58.69]Here we go.
[18:59.05]Push! Push! Push! Push! Push!
[19:31.73]I don't need him to say push.
[19:32.99]Is that it?
[19:36.55]If your timing's off, or if you press the wrong button, you take damage!
[19:43.06]I mean, you're adorable, but I don't need you to say it.
[19:45.08]One, two, three, four!
[19:56.36]I don't like how they're not colored correctly.
[19:59.68]Oh, I guess they are.
[20:00.28]What am I talking about?
[20:01.96]Red is, uh... Yeah, pink is square.
[20:03.30]You got it!
[20:04.18]But don't let your guard down!
[20:05.72]Go soft on defense, and it's curtains for you!
[20:09.10]Lastly, the final.
[20:10.56]If you've reached final, it's really in the bank!
[20:13.42]Your opponent's been weakened, so attack, attack!
[20:16.65]But also keep an eye on that power gauge!
[20:18.31]So I get to, like, just strum random stuff?
[20:19.75]The first runner on the power loses!
[20:21.69]And remember, your own mistakes make you lose power, too!
[20:26.40]Okay, so don't make mistakes.
[20:28.02]Easy.
[20:33.18]Yeah, I just won't make any mistakes.
[20:34.58]Tutorial boss incoming.
[20:35.81]Good.
[20:57.10]Don't make any mistakes.
[21:26.14]Here we go, defense.
[21:28.98]It's just about timing.
[21:32.11]It's just right when the beat happens.
[21:34.59]I'll be really good at this.
[21:38.59]Now it's my turn.
[22:12.70]Oh, that's fucking hard when you go around in a circle.
[22:15.57]What's wrong?
[22:17.35]What's wrong?
[22:18.19]What's wrong?
[22:20.85]Why did he stop?
[22:27.68]Oh, I'm beat.
[22:29.04]This is too much.
[22:30.26]I can't do this.
[22:31.36]I'm Tempest, and I'm going to chop you in half.
[22:37.60]What the...
[22:41.16]Dude, you know it's getting real when their mouth turns into a square.
[22:46.48]That's how you know shit's hitting the fucking fan.
[22:48.42]Uh-oh, this is real.
[23:08.79]This is an issue.
[23:09.35]This is a little issue that I have here.
[23:11.73]I have an old... I have an... Hold on.
[23:14.63]Somebody's coming in the room.
[23:15.57]Could you just open this jar real quick?
[23:18.90]Sorry.
[23:19.12]I'm getting like jump scared from behind.
[23:21.96]Open this jar?
[23:22.84]How come every time... This is just what I do.
[23:33.23]Look at that.
[23:34.35]Thank you.
[23:35.41]I still got it.
[23:36.29]Thank you.
[23:37.21]I still got it.
[23:39.07]I just opened jars on stream.
[23:40.47]I'll give you one now.
[23:41.03]Sorry about that.
[23:48.46]The last, okay, I think the last three Kim appearances on stream have been open the jar, here comes the dog, open the jar.
[24:00.66]I'm fairly certain about that.
[24:05.08]Alright, here we go.
[24:06.66]Retry, no.
[24:09.56]Try again.
[24:11.36]I lost already?
[24:12.18]Alright.
[24:18.21]I'm ready.
[24:20.23]Why do you get full power?
[24:22.07]What I was gonna say is, I have a... I don't have an official PlayStation 2 controller.
[24:29.03]I can already see the issue here already.
[24:32.56]Okay, excuse me, let's go.
[24:37.56]It's very, uh, jagged.
[24:40.20]Yeah!
[25:01.95]What do you got?
[25:06.97]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[25:21.19]I got that right, what happened?
[25:24.49]Defense mode incoming.
[25:36.41]Why do I feel like I'm doing that wrong?
[25:43.66]Get out of here.
[25:54.87]Oops!
[26:02.33]This is actually really fun.
[26:08.16]Ja-ja-ja-ja-ja-ja-ja!
[26:28.61]I'll tell you one thing, though.
[26:30.05]This takes every single ounce of my concentration.
[26:34.87]I don't have room in my brain.
[26:44.80]Not today.
[26:47.08]It's taken up every spot in my mind.
[26:50.18]The final, here we go.
[27:07.81]Got it.
[27:19.62]What?
[27:21.50]I didn't know there was no lion.
[27:34.73]No!
[27:35.35]Sorry, I won't be bad anymore.
[27:38.36]I'll be good!
[27:43.98]Bad ending.
[27:47.16]Yeah, I won.
[27:52.70]You win.
[27:54.52]Who's the dinosaur?
[27:56.34]The game is way too fast.
[28:01.72]I got a V. I'll take a V.
[28:09.55]How many misses?
[28:10.58]Only 4%.
[28:12.04]I got mostly good.
[28:14.94]That's a B. I'll take a B. Replay this game.
[28:17.78]What?
[28:17.94]What are you talking about?
[28:21.64]Replay this game.
[28:25.23]Collection.
[28:25.79]Get.
[28:26.31]Save current game.
[28:27.33]Yes.
[28:32.13]Put it in slot 1.
[28:36.69]Which bank will you save game data in?
[28:40.86]I don't know.
[28:42.36]Like, the Toothbrush Lizard?
[28:53.27]Alright, sounds good.
[29:10.97]What?
[29:11.59]Wouldn't he be more injured?
[29:13.82]I feel like the first try I could do a better job dubbing that.
[29:23.56]I mean, maybe not like the quality of the voice, but like the quality of the singing.
[29:28.06]My dog can talk!
[29:28.52]That's a real quick way to get everyone to pay attention.
[30:00.22]No, but then it's like every television show that's ever had a talking animal in it.
[30:05.87]They'll come over and the dog won't talk.
[30:08.55]It'll just like pee on a hydrant or something.
[30:10.33]It won't speak.
[30:12.53]What the fuck is this?
[30:18.30]Remember the Warner Brothers frog?
[30:24.82]The guy that found the frog there, hello my baby, hello my darling, and nobody, he didn't do it in front of anybody else and the guy went nuts?
[30:40.98]That's a Boomer reference?
[30:41.86]No, that's a classic piece of animation history.
[30:46.46]Alright, get ready.
[30:48.12]Flying O. We're gonna stop the UFO invasion.
[31:00.25]This song is pretty good.
[31:01.23]I gotta get both headphones into this song.
[31:04.63]Nice!
[31:05.35]Pretty good!
[32:02.58]I'm sorry.
[32:06.08]Stop.
[32:06.34]What do you mean killing?
[32:07.44]I'm not killing anybody.
[32:09.30]I'm still winning.
[32:30.69]Slot machine.
[32:31.41]I love it.
[32:43.80]Damn it!
[32:44.24]This controller sucks.
[32:46.42]What brand is this?
[32:47.88]It's unbranded.
[32:48.87]That's the problem.
[32:49.37]I have an unbranded controller right now.
[32:52.05]That's bad.
[32:52.51]It's not even a Mad Catz.
[33:06.03]I'm still winning.
[33:07.27]Alright, y'all gotta pay attention.
[33:21.76]Come on!
[33:22.44]I was doing it!
[33:23.12]I haven't taken very much damage, that's alright.
[33:43.56]Okay, be ready.
[33:59.64]Oh, come on.
[34:01.14]This thing's unbranded.
[34:03.20]It's unbranded.
[34:05.60]It has a turbo though.
[34:12.84]Watch out, little lady.
[34:50.29]That's the last note again.
[34:53.63]You absolutely fucked the ending.
[35:12.00]You win!
[35:18.95]I still did okay.
[35:21.29]B. I'll take it.
[35:28.93]Why do I not have an official PS2 controller?
[35:33.08]What was I thinking?
[35:35.54]I mean, yes, this is a purchase from like three years ago.
[35:41.52]Go get one.
[35:42.02]No, I don't need one.
[35:43.28]I'll deal with it.
[35:43.76]It's an excuse.
[35:58.38]Can you imagine?
[35:59.18]Okay, so I don't want... I can't leave.
[36:00.48]I don't want to leave right now.
[36:01.46]Like, no, I can't.
[36:02.10]I don't want to leave.
[36:02.62]I just started the stream.
[36:06.01]Imagine, like, Uber Eatsing a PlayStation 2 controller.
[36:11.69]Like Postmates-ing an Uber Eats controller?
[36:14.98]I can't... You can't buy these, guys!
[36:19.30]There's no buying these!
[36:20.74]A PlayStation 2 controller, you can't buy them anywhere.
[36:25.26]You have to, like, special get them on, like, Amazon.
[36:34.69]Do Amazon Same Day Prime.
[36:37.07]Yeah, it'll be here in, like, 12 hours!
[36:42.46]Same day delivery.
[36:43.39]Yeah, it's 3 o'clock Pacific.
[36:53.27]Okay, let's go.
[36:56.41]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[36:58.35]No, don't.
[36:58.71]I already did it, didn't I?
[37:09.06]Yes!
[37:09.60]No!
[37:11.56]Sir, this is the last gitaro man.
[37:14.50]What are the gitaro?
[37:15.66]Get Amazon Ultra delivery.
[37:16.78]The legendary gitaro inside Flangle's body.
[37:19.56]Sir, sir, it's been taken!
[37:21.48]Listen up.
[37:22.88]We have lost two gitaros already.
[37:25.42]I want them back.
[37:26.70]And bring me his gitaro.
[37:27.96]The last gitaro.
[37:29.36]Do not fail me.
[37:31.23]Send Moto King B into the forest.
[37:33.25]The last gitaro.
[37:37.07]Okay, listen, you one.
[37:38.59]You're of the Gitaro Man bloodline, inheritor of the legendary Gitaro.
[37:41.98]Of course.
[37:42.42]If you can collect all of the Gitaros, you'll gain great powers and... Boom, huh?
[37:46.48]I have other plans.
[37:48.20]I'm gonna practice my skateboarding and Pico's gonna be like, wow, you're so cool.
[37:52.02]If you live in your dreams, you're gonna know future, you one.
[37:55.71]Are you sure that that dog's okay?
[37:57.35]It's got like a squashed head.
[38:24.82]Alright, here we go.
[38:39.78]I didn't even see the intro here.
[38:40.80]Frog?
[39:05.01]Alright, let's do it.
[39:30.61]Well, this is definitely the best song so far.
[39:35.98]Alright, battle time.
[40:12.99]That's all the commentary you're gonna get.
[40:14.28]That's the only thing I'm gonna say this whole stream.
[40:16.90]I guarantee it.
[40:19.64]Is... Yeah!
[40:21.80]Yeah!
[40:23.75]Just cap that and just play it over and over again.
[40:44.91]I'm not doing that bad this one, I'm not.
[40:53.78]Yeah!
[40:55.38]Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[41:27.60]I'm sorry.
[41:29.02]I'm sorry.
[41:30.84]I'm sorry.
[41:31.72]I was trying to think of what to say.
[41:33.72]I gotta come up with my bread and butter.
[41:43.78]Oh no!
[41:45.10]Oh shit, I have the whole thing screwed up.
[42:10.87]Did I win?
[42:13.94]Where?
[42:14.22]It's pretty, it's pretty close.
[42:39.32]God damn it.
[43:10.36]Here comes the finale!
[43:17.10]Oh my god.
[43:17.86]TIP!
[43:37.54]Kim POST MAKES ME A PlayStation 2 CONTROLLER!
[43:40.40]What?
[43:45.09]What do you mean try again?
[43:51.75]No.
[43:57.95]What, I can't press start?
[44:01.94]Hold on, if I pause the game, that's immediate retry?
[44:08.19]Oh, what?
[44:12.91]Oh, that's not good.
[44:15.66]There's no breaks.
[44:21.10]You actually can't fall.
[44:22.28]I guess I understand because it's cheating.
[44:25.61]There was like 30 seconds left in this song.
[44:39.38]Hold on a second.
[44:56.62]Okay.
[44:58.46]Here we go!
[45:01.60]It's the PS2 version of this game, not the controller.
[45:03.62]The controls are poopy.
[45:11.81]What the fuck?
[45:12.81]Why do I have half health?
[45:14.45]Alright, I'm gonna- this is the one.
[45:15.59]Here we go.
[45:17.61]Can you pause real quick?
[45:21.55]I need to pee.
[45:22.10]No, we're gonna turn it up.
[45:23.18]That's what we're gonna do.
[45:24.30]You got pee?
[45:27.32]Ah, that's too bad.
[45:33.04]You know what?
[45:33.52]I'm fine.
[45:33.96]I like the song.
[45:35.18]The song is good.
[45:35.94]Here we go.
[45:54.10]Alright.
[45:54.32]What happened here?
[46:00.08]Alright, something fucked up is going on here.
[46:04.04]Boom.
[46:08.29]Did this shit get harder because I retried it?
[46:10.21]I don't remember being as hard.
[46:42.97]Going from down to up or left to right is like... I think this shit didn't happen the last time I did this.
[47:01.74]Like, look, I'm not doing anything!
[47:04.92]I'm not doing... I wasn't doing anything.
[47:08.20]I was holding it in the same spot.
[47:29.07]I've never played DDR I'm serious not one time
[48:10.98]DDR was the only exercise I ever got.
[48:15.25]Nah, that's what I had Wii Sports for.
[48:52.48]Getting close.
[48:55.30]Alright, finale.
[49:10.29]This is it.
[49:13.01]Pause game.
[49:13.61]I'm not pausing!
[49:14.47]I can't!
[49:27.21]Come on!
[49:39.02]No!
[49:39.80]It's Stu!
[49:40.30]You don't get it!
[49:40.98]Look at the chain!
[49:43.35]Look at the chain!
[49:45.25]I'm sorry.
[49:45.75]Let's see!
[50:02.61]I didn't fuck that up!
[50:07.47]Alright, so if I... Look, see what happened?
[50:09.59]So I'm moving from... Like, I'm moving one degree.
[50:12.63]Sometimes you move one degree and it goes to, like, four o'clock.
[50:16.57]I think it's an o'clock.
[50:17.51]If you start at twelve and you want to move it to one, it will go to, like, four o'clock sometimes.
[50:26.23]I'm telling you.
[50:33.94]Hold on a second.
[50:48.58]It's not possible.
[50:51.14]You can't.
[50:52.24]I can't get a PS2 controller right now.
[50:53.74]I have to exercise those options.
[51:06.85]Okay.
[51:08.59]Looks good.
[51:09.11]This isn't happening, this isn't happening, this isn't happening.
[51:19.68]It's me, of course, Miranda the Elder.
[51:23.00]Quite impressive, Jitaru man, defeating such a powerful Gravillian agent.
[51:26.65]Gravillian?
[51:28.68]Oh-ho, we've prayed and waited for this moment.
[51:31.30]Kitaru has to come to Planet Kitaru immediately and free us prisoners from captivity.
[51:36.16]It's Stewie.
[51:38.00]What's Kitaru?
[51:39.31]Farewell.
[51:39.93]I await you on Planet Kitaru.
[51:42.17]It's one of Stewie's grand, like, steam costumes.
[51:45.79]Where'd he go?
[51:48.49]Huh?
[51:49.95]All systems A-OK, you one.
[51:52.39]Oh, no, I don't want to go.
[51:54.09]I don't... Whoa!
[51:55.01]Whoa!
[52:05.77]He just wants to learn how to skateboard.
[52:11.29]What?
[52:12.91]Everything in life is the consequence of your own acts.
[52:16.13]Master the waves.
[52:20.21]So you're here, Guitarroman.
[52:21.75]Release Benkei.
[52:22.61]Sir!
[52:22.73]Alright, here we are.
[52:28.99]Two moons!
[52:30.85]Hurry, Guitarroman, hurry!
[52:37.42]Like, wasn't that guy just... That's a shark?
[52:39.54]It's a hammerhead shark that plays music.
[52:44.44]Here we go.
[53:20.52]It's a weird beat.
[53:21.56]It's a little bit of a weird beat.
[53:23.22]It's hard to keep up with.
[53:24.82]Because there's off beats.
[53:39.19]Not that hard.
[53:40.53]It was.
[53:41.35]I'm not going to diminish the fact that it was very hard.
[54:06.58]Oh, I gotta pause the game.
[54:07.72]I gotta pause it.
[54:36.51]Oh my god, when can I fight him?
[54:44.10]Can I do damage?
[54:44.82]Is that just phase one?
[54:52.74]That's probably phase one.
[54:55.00]You made it.
[54:55.38]No, that's it, I did it.
[54:59.66]Alright, that was pretty tricky.
[55:10.99]The issue was the .
[55:12.59]So it goes and you have to press the .
[55:16.05]It can get tricky.
[55:19.05]Okay.
[55:25.22]Overwrite it.
[55:30.74]Save it.
[56:00.34]Is this first playthrough?
[56:01.22]Yes.
[56:01.82]I have never played this game before.
[56:05.24]Wait, what?
[56:06.36]Did he transform it into a deep turntable?
[56:13.96]Alright, that's pretty crazy.
[56:18.33]That's pretty crazy.
[56:33.28]The music for this level sucks.
[56:35.52]Does it?
[56:36.82]No.
[56:46.50]This is a good start.
[56:48.50]I love how I have a little band.
[56:53.50]I love it.
[56:53.90]Alright, let's do it.
[57:00.02]Mech battle.
[57:08.20]Follow me!
[57:30.26]These fucking controls, man.
[57:32.52]Like, give me a break.
[57:35.20]Like, look at that!
[57:36.44]How do I... Nah, there's no way.
[58:01.79]What the fuck did I do wrong here?
[58:19.18]No, no, no, look at- it's not- you see what happens here?
[58:24.16]No way!
[58:25.16]Uh-uh!
[58:25.70]It's not me, look!
[58:30.43]It's not me!
[58:31.15]Look what happens!
[58:32.18]Look at this!
[59:00.29]Why?
[59:00.77]Stop!
[59:00.91]I have to tilt my neck!
[59:27.93]I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this one.
[59:43.88]Oh my god, guys.
[59:47.20]I can't post-bait the controller, Kim already looked!
[59:50.26]It's alright, I can still win.
[60:11.12]Don't push the stick.
[60:12.43]So when you see it spaz out, that is probably one degree change.
[60:31.20]I can still win.
[60:31.84]That might become a real problem later on though.
[60:58.37]I've heard better reggae.
[61:02.94]Well, it doesn't help that half of the song is not being played.
[61:30.98]I'm still gonna win this game.
[61:32.44]I mean, my defense is just absolutely impenetrable.
[62:07.27]I almost paused the game for that one.
[62:09.11]Oh, I actually did it!
[62:10.00]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
[62:10.90]No!
[62:46.78]No.
[62:50.52]Any time there's a change of direction is where it becomes impossible.
[63:21.65]Finale incoming!
[63:22.59]Remember, I left the Baskin Robbins in the market to get these ice creams.
[63:27.01]Hash out to your hook.
[63:27.97]It's all your way to death.
[63:30.63]Okay.
[63:33.10]No, that's it.
[63:33.70]That was the finale.
[63:35.46]Use the D-pad?
[63:36.64]I don't think you can.
[63:39.56]This one's probably gonna be a C. I can't guarantee a B for this one.
[63:42.52]Yes, I can.
[63:51.89]Save, please.
[63:52.79]Save, please.
[63:53.35]What am I doing wrong?
[63:58.07]Save.
[63:59.45]Previously saved game data exists.
[64:00.99]Overwrite saved data.
[64:02.25]Yes.
[64:07.64]Hold on a second.
[64:11.44]Wouldn't the highlighted one be the one that's...
[64:22.43]Okay.
[64:24.21]Huh?
[64:25.61]What's that?
[64:27.87]I am the belly of the Grevilleans.
[64:29.98]You may hand over your guitar to me.
[64:31.72]Huh?
[64:33.84]That is the legendary last guitar I have been searching for all my life.
[64:36.86]Don't give it to him, you one!
[64:38.76]Of course not!
[64:41.16]Very well.
[64:42.49]Our empire is beginning its conquest of the universe.
[64:45.63]I'll start off with you, weaklings.
[64:47.23]You cannot possibly defeat me.
[64:50.23]Rick and Morty voice acting.
[64:51.93]Yeah, that's the demeanor that Justin Roiland does for every character that's a character that you're not supposed to care about.
[65:19.06]Hey, it's me.
[65:19.74]This character.
[65:20.58]The one that talks like this.
[65:21.88]I'm doing this.
[65:22.50]I'm in the bathtub.
[65:24.03]It's me.
[65:24.63]Bathtub.
[65:25.01]I'm the bathtub guy.
[65:26.51]What are you doing here?
[65:44.36]I didn't know, okay?
[65:46.20]I thought I had jaundice.
[65:47.34]Like I said, there's a whole... Alright, I'm not going to talk over custom.
[65:56.04]So, who is this Pico?
[65:57.94]Oh, just an old flame.
[65:59.92]Ah, love.
[66:01.89]I envy you.
[66:02.83]Love is something I can never hope for.
[66:05.13]Never?
[66:05.53]Oh, don't worry about it.
[66:07.29]I just came out for a walk to see the moon.
[66:09.57]But then I heard that...
[66:11.73]Is there a reason why every, like, anime young boy character is an old lady straining?
[66:39.30]The voice.
[66:40.99]That's- Isn't that strange?
[66:51.61]It's weird, right?
[66:55.25]Wait, this is like a- Hold on.
[67:03.21]I wrote this song for you!
[67:07.86]No, hold on.
[67:08.32]I've been practicing.
[67:13.57]Don't get up!
[67:14.07]Don't get up!
[67:14.51]Hold on.
[67:23.65]Oh, no.
[67:25.67]Sorry.
[67:26.15]I have to go home now.
[67:28.16]Wait!
[67:29.58]Can I offer you some tea?
[67:31.48]Or maybe...
[67:40.88]That's fucking funny.
[67:42.70]Alright, let's do it for real.
[67:49.01]You ruined this kid's day.
[67:50.65]Let's see what happens after a few weeks of practice.
[67:56.37]Actually, probably more like eight years of practice.
[67:59.23]10,000 hours of practice.
[68:08.29]He's gonna play Wonderwall.
[68:16.36]No, he's not.
[68:17.56]I love how she just looks over like, okay, come on.
[68:39.47]Come on.
[68:41.47]You fucked that one up.
[68:50.56]Why does she have a life bar?
[68:51.88]Why am I, like, killing her?
[68:56.36]I guess... I kind of would be, like, in this situation, right?
[69:03.43]Just gotta listen to this?
[69:17.52]Alright, he's got half the notes, okay.
[69:20.67]Nice job.
[69:33.27]That's the abrupt changes.
[69:57.31]I'm trying.
[70:06.26]Don't make me laugh.
[70:14.75]Don't make me laugh, please.
[70:17.17]It's almost over.
[70:28.36]I did it!
[70:37.97]I got another V. That's too generous.
[70:51.33]No, it's not.
[70:52.11]It's fine.
[70:57.71]Just in case anyone was curious, I have to press the down button on the D-pad.
[71:02.26]It's not left.
[71:03.04]It's not right.
[71:03.64]It's down on the D-pad.
[71:06.73]I'm sorry.
[71:07.21]And it was fucking completely silent too.
[71:11.95]The singer's voice was honey love.
[71:14.08]What?
[71:23.06]Where's Puma?
[71:24.62]Puma!
[71:25.20]Puma!
[71:26.90]Puma, where'd you go?
[71:28.12]Why'd you leave me?
[71:29.49]What am I gonna do all by myself?
[71:31.49]Puma!
[71:33.33]Oh no, not again!
[71:36.87]That's expensive.
[71:39.92]I have you now, Gitaroo Man.

[71:44.50]Puma, what's happened?
[71:45.92]Where could you have gone?
[71:46.97]I want those shoes.
[71:47.63]I'm so lonely, Puma.
[71:48.71]Those things are awesome.
[71:49.41]We've been together so long.
[71:51.15]That's why I said I didn't want to come to this stupid place.
[71:56.82]What?
[71:57.70]It's moving.
[71:58.44]Oh.
[71:58.50]Ah!
[72:02.59]I probably can get those at a mall kiosk.
[72:04.63]You know, like the big goofy sneakers, slippers.
[72:06.43]Don't say it.
[72:06.83]I know what they look like.
[72:24.50]This is gonna be fun.
[72:25.98]Alright, how's this one?
[72:26.56]Anybody know the songs?
[72:27.82]Is this one good?
[72:28.32]All of a sudden it's like.

[78:06.17]Alright, it's all about defense.
[78:07.81]Okay, that one's just doing it on its own.

[80:27.86]I don't know I
[80:38.88]I thought it was, like, redo it, like, do it again.
[80:41.54]I don't know that the game records everything you do.
[80:43.78]And by the way, MonkaS.
[80:59.66]God damn it.
[81:08.30]What the fuck?
[81:09.30]I just wanted to retry the level.
[81:10.70]Replay this level.
[81:11.60]When they're all collected, a great power will shake the sky.
[81:13.52]You can't allow Zoe to possess that power.
[81:37.36]Let's do it.
[81:42.82]We gotta get out of here.
[81:48.87]Okay, here we go.
[81:55.35]Just two more, that's it?
[81:56.46]I'm about to beat this fucking game.
[82:11.01]This is Gregorio... That's either the third, or that is... A scroll?
[82:18.96]Like a magic scroll?
[82:22.12]Or... It's a... A sand time thing that you turn upside down?
[82:28.89]This just sounds pretty good.
[82:34.39]Alright, let me get this done.
[82:36.53]Pull yourself together!
[82:37.59]Believe in yourself!
[82:48.39]Replay it.
[83:05.36]These last two might be very hard.
[83:13.97]Can I turn, like, sensitivity down?
[83:17.01]Definitely not.
[83:20.58]And look at it, it's so small!
[83:22.54]It's such a tiny increase!
[83:23.85]It's... it's stuck!
[83:25.47]There's no fucking way you can do this.
[83:33.17]With this control.
[83:34.21]It's not even possible, I don't think.
[83:46.99]No, I win.
[83:49.85]I'm trying so hard right now.
[84:18.26]Got it!
[84:22.52]Winning!

[85:47.71]Why did somebody just say- Oh, Mega Lull.
[85:49.31]For what reason?
[85:50.83]For what reason did you say that?
[86:00.49]Oh!
[86:28.97]I'm gonna win!
[86:46.76]Oh my god, it's too hard!
[86:50.10]I'm doing it wrong!
[86:50.70]I don't know what I'm doing wrong!
[86:52.88]It's okay.

[87:29.26]What?!
[87:32.22]Mama.
[87:34.06]I've done it again.
[87:38.45]It's so hard to control.
[87:40.35]It's so hard.
[87:42.55]It's the analog.
[87:43.95]Please.
[87:44.93]I'm telling you.
[87:45.71]Don't think I'm bad.
[87:47.01]It's not me.
[87:50.07]It's not me.
[87:51.11]Okay.
[87:52.50]Don't think that I'm not good.
[87:54.18]It's not me.
[87:56.28]This isn't me.
[87:57.54]It's not me.
[88:05.54]Alright.
[88:05.90]Focus.
[88:18.14]This guy gives me the creeps.
[88:21.22]It was the controller.
[88:23.92]Come on, Gwen.
[88:45.87]I didn't do anything!
[88:55.65]Alright, let's go.
[89:10.04]I just ripped to the side.
[89:11.44]Come on.
[89:15.07]Good.
[89:15.77]Here comes the battle part.
[89:29.84]Alright, get ready.
[89:37.79]I fucked it up last time.
[89:39.19]Bad.
[89:39.97]Not this time.
[89:47.59]What happened there?
[89:48.57]What was the problem?
[89:49.75]I don't get it.
[90:42.88]Get the fuck out of here!
[90:52.77]Alright, this is where it's hard.

[91:52.79]NOOO!
[91:54.53]Mama!
[91:56.35]I've done it again.
[91:57.36]That was a loud scream.
[92:19.85]That was like a bat just came in my room and flew right into my face like a pigeon got in here.
[92:34.42]It's like, da-da-da-da-da-da, but I'd say, goddammit, I have to have more health there.
[92:42.19]Somebody told me the emulator doesn't have this problem.
[92:58.23]Well, this is the original.
[93:00.03]We have to deal with how much it SUCKS.
[93:25.31]I'm gonna beat him this time.
[93:27.03]Alright, I'm ready.
[93:27.57]Here we go.

[93:30.77]This is it.
[93:31.21]Here we go.
[93:34.29]I'm not doing it this time.
[93:35.83]I think twice already.
[93:36.85]Imagine I did it.
[93:37.67]Pretend I did it.
[93:39.05]Nah, I got full health.
[95:05.27]Okay, here we go.
[95:06.15]Fuck, don't fuck it up.
[95:07.35]Don't fuck it up!
[95:08.55]It's hard, but don't screw it up.
[95:11.02]I gotta have both hands on the controller here.

[97:18.17]There's one more after this?
[97:25.50]I missed a lot.
[97:26.96]It's okay.
[97:29.36]The final boss is even worse.
[97:30.84]Shit.
[97:35.45]No, I don't want to replay this game.

[107:32.58]It's just you!
[107:33.26]What did you say, Poop?
[107:35.04]You think I can't beat you by myself?

[114:35.70]I think I won.
[114:37.84]I lost there for a second.
[114:44.34]I was joking.
[114:45.14]I was joking really hard at the end.
[114:47.49]But I did it.
[114:48.07]It's okay.
[114:51.09]Damn.
[114:55.23]That was a lot.
[114:59.72]32%.
[114:59.74]Great.
[115:03.35]36% good.
[115:03.63]This is gonna be an A. What?
[115:11.84]Oh, because B is purple.
[115:14.36]Okay, I get it.
[115:15.76]It's alright.
[115:16.26]Whatever.
[115:27.54]That song was wild.
[115:31.61]That was a good one.
[116:01.41]I did it!
[116:03.21]Hooray.
[116:04.77]It doesn't take much to turn impossible into I'm possible.
[116:09.87]What?
[116:10.91]I've taken the leap.
[116:12.27]It's your turn.
[116:15.10]This is a bad ending.
[116:19.47]Hey, Yuan.
[116:20.57]Oh, hi, Pico.
[116:21.81]Did you go somewhere this summer, Yuan?
[116:23.87]Huh?
[116:24.47]Oh, well, I, uh... Hey, Yuan.
[116:26.67]Why don't you give it up?
[116:27.93]You're starting to get on my nerves.
[116:30.51]Come on, Pico.
[116:31.17]This kid's a loser.
[116:32.59]You can't do anything.
[116:36.09]Just do the sprint.
[116:37.65]Bang!
[116:38.61]Here we go.
[116:39.01]Epilogue song.
[116:39.59]Come on.
[116:40.35]Let's go, Pico.
[116:41.73]Okay.
[116:43.75]Epilogue song.
[116:44.53]Come on.
[116:46.19]Time out fast on a train ran all by night
[116:50.66]You know my name?
[116:51.62]What does that mean?
[116:52.76]New hard mode.
[117:21.25]Oh, I mean, I know this board.
[117:24.23]We play the game.
[117:47.60]You can't hear me
[118:14.93]Somebody said, the game's only three hours.
[118:16.43]Perfect for someone with chronic intestinal problems.
[118:19.89]You're right.
[118:28.31]What the fuck are you talking about?
[118:37.48]Alright, skip.
[118:38.84]Skip it.
[118:53.42]What game is this?
[119:03.78]It's not open.
[119:11.35]And this is great.
[119:15.75]But it's not open.
[119:21.41]Turn the game off so you can refund it on Steam.
[119:24.13]This is a collector's item.
[119:26.47]Why would I refund a collector's item?
[119:33.60]Yeah, PS2 Steam game.
[119:46.28]Master's play.
[119:47.60]Oh no.
[119:49.92]Theater?
[119:51.08]What's theater?
[119:54.61]Oh, it's just the cutscenes.
[120:01.99]Master's play.
[120:03.09]There's more.
[120:04.87]Oh man, what is this?
[120:13.20]I don't know what that even meant.
[120:14.79]I don't understand.
[120:17.13]This is Master's... This is hard mode.
[120:20.09]What does it add?
[120:20.99]Just more...
[120:41.98]Timings?
[120:42.40]What beats and everything?
[120:45.72]What do you think about this?
[120:48.12]It starts you at like no health.
[120:54.73]This is a good song though.
[121:25.67]Oh, I didn't do that.
[121:53.99]Spinning, spinning, spinning!
[121:57.25]Oh yeah!
[122:14.87]No!
[122:32.14]No, it's not.
[122:32.66]I'm doing fine.
[122:33.10]What was this guy?
[122:42.69]Was this guy in the original?
[123:16.57]I should get a medal for floor tennis.
[123:20.62]Check me out!
[123:21.56]Ho!
[123:55.71]Come on!
[123:57.70]Come on!
[123:59.02]That was so close!
[124:40.59]Got it!
[124:41.17]That was easy.
[124:47.15]No, not really.
[124:48.17]You win!
[124:48.81]This would be fun to play high as fuck.
[125:11.51]I mean, or not.
[125:14.77]It doesn't matter, it could be normal.
[125:23.71]We're gonna hit a wall.
[125:25.89]Probably the next song, I would say.
[125:28.43]I'm gonna watch the cutscene.
[125:44.72]Alright, this one's gonna be tricky.
[125:58.63]Don't skip lore?
[125:59.91]We already saw it.
[126:03.57]On one of these I'm gonna do Sincerely Tired Leon.
[126:06.19]It's gonna be an embarrassment.
[127:21.52]Don't move!
[127:24.66]I'm not, no I'm not.
[127:29.70]Oh, fuck you.
[127:36.09]I did it, I did it fine!
[127:37.69]I just fell down.
[127:42.37]Oh, slot machine, remember?
[128:06.62]the PlayStation 2 is hooked up I have a couple of secret PlayStation 2 games back here secret ones
[128:37.84]That I have never played on this stream.
[128:45.87]Or... Or... I put in Um Jammer Lammy.
[128:53.67]And we continue the rhythm games.
[128:58.80]Probably Um Jammer Lammy requires... I have to switch out the PS2 and the PS1.
[129:11.54]So, I actually do need to take a small break.
[129:17.92]For reasons.
[129:19.58]So, I'm going to leave it up to you.
[129:22.63]We'll do another couple hours.
[129:29.17]So, let's do that.
[129:29.89]Let's be right back.
[129:31.01]I'll put a poll in here.
[129:33.11]Either secret PlayStation 2 games, or game, or I'm Jammer Lambie.
[129:38.39]But that requires me to switch out the PS1.
[129:44.18]Uh, Gitaro Man is actually pretty fun.
[129:47.56]I might actually try to do like one or two more levels in Gitaro Man.
[129:51.18]It's fun.
[129:52.12]It's hard to control, but it's fun.
[129:54.24]Okay.
[129:55.34]Which one?
[129:56.95]Um, Jammer.
[129:59.95]Lambie?
[130:02.57]Or... Secret PS2 game.
[130:06.35]Guess what?
[130:06.89]I don't even know what it is.
[130:09.65]It could be anything, because I don't even fucking know.
[130:15.61]Alright, I'll be right back.
[130:16.41]I'm gonna be a couple minutes, so... Go grab a snack if you want to.
[130:20.47]I'll be right back.
[130:27.54]The PS2 is backwards compatible!
[130:29.10]Are you fucking kidding me?
[130:30.06]Why would I do that?
[130:31.26]I almost just unhooked everything!
[130:36.28]I forgot!
[130:37.62]Wow!
[130:39.35]Okay.
[130:40.41]Alright, I'll be right back though, anyways.
