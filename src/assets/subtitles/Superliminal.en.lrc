[02:17.15]I just, wait, I signed it?
[02:18.00]I didn't want to sign it.
[02:18.80]I just want to look at it.
[02:28.26]This FOV feels huge.
[02:30.46]You missed the intro.
[02:42.80]What intro?
[02:43.98]You missed the intro.
[02:45.84]Who cares?
[02:46.26]Does it matter?
[02:55.38]Are you filled with feelings of self-doubt?
[02:58.34]Do you find yourself prone to minimising massive dilemmas?
[03:02.11]Or for allowing the smallest problems to get blown completely out of proportion?
[03:07.43]At the Peirce Institute, our patent-pending Somnoscope technology provides safe and effective dream therapy while you rest in the comfort of our flagship clinic.
[03:19.19]Located right next to the secondary overflow parking lot at the University Medical Center.
[03:25.32]I'll turn it up.
[03:33.85]So I see an ad for that and then I go do it.
[03:37.21]And I had to see that so badly.
[03:38.87]You could have just told me, hey, you saw an ad on TV for this place.
[03:44.49]Is that better?
[03:55.80]Now you have context.
[03:56.70]Yeah, that's true.
[03:57.38]Let's go ahead and sign it.
[03:58.08]Okay, signed it with my nose.
[04:15.12]Reception is reality.
[04:16.44]Grab.
[04:35.13]What?
[04:35.27]I don't get it.
[04:36.05]Okay.

[05:27.55]Alright.
[05:29.91]Okay.
[05:30.66]I get it.
[05:37.55]Terms of service accepted.
[05:39.31]Congratulations on falling asleep.
[05:41.71]Welcome to Somnascult.
[05:43.25]Your progress may be monitored by qualified specialists.
[05:47.25]This orientation will adapt you to Eyelids, our interactive, lucid induction dream state in which you retain full consciousness and control.
[05:54.95]Okay.
[05:58.42]What do you want me to do?
[05:59.80]Move this?
[06:05.84]Oh, fuck.
[06:06.40]What do I do?
[06:13.94]What?
[06:15.74]Wait, what?
[06:16.14]I don't get it.
[06:16.92]What just happened?
[06:21.40]What?
[06:21.64]Okay, what do I do?
[06:29.69]Do I have to play chess?
[06:38.47]Okay, put the board here.
[06:40.21]No, that's too small.
[06:41.33]Um...
[06:45.98]Oh, that's huge.
[06:46.58]Do I have to make this big?
[06:47.70]Oh, I thought I had to play chess.
[07:20.76]Shit.
[07:21.24]It's okay.
[07:21.65]That works.
[07:31.32]No objects beyond this point at all times.
[08:12.34]I'll make it big.
[08:30.36]Make it look big.
[08:38.24]Can I, like, hold it up to my eye?
[08:39.90]How do I hold it up to my eye?
[08:41.82]Well, that's gone now.
[08:44.16]I broke the game, and I have to restart the whole thing.
[08:46.09]Thank God.
[08:49.47]How do I hold it up close?
[08:51.57]Distance.
[08:51.97]Yeah, but can I crouch?
[08:57.86]Is there a way I can pull it forward to look at it closer?
[09:23.23]Whoa.
[09:23.61]Well, now what?
[09:32.85]What do I do?
[09:33.27]What do I do about it?
[09:34.84]How do I get it in there?
[09:35.48]The vent?
[09:41.38]How do I get it through?
[09:41.98]I can't.
[09:42.40]How do I put it?
[09:42.94]Just go through?
[09:43.56]I thought I couldn't.
[09:45.22]Wait, I'm confused.
[09:46.06]I can't bring this through.
[09:49.20]So how do I put it here?
[09:55.46]Put it in the vent?
[09:56.06]Yeah, I can't go through the block, so how do I get the block in here?
[10:07.03]Is there a vent? ...
[10:39.79]Ooh!
[10:41.05]Sneaky!
[10:58.42]Shit.
[10:58.78]Hold on.
[11:03.58]No, I want it to be smaller?
[11:12.56]Confirmed.
[11:13.46]You can move freely, interact with surrounding objects, and listen to messages from your patient care team.
[11:19.70]Please note that I am the standard orientation protocol and that my voice has been explicitly chosen to remind you that I am not a part of your patient care team.
[11:29.09]I do not care.
[11:32.56]Whoa, it's big.
[11:33.24]Alright, so now just go through here?
[11:45.25]Shit.
[11:50.45]Dude, smoke is coming out of his ears.
[11:51.97]Hold to... Okay.
[11:59.72]Okay.
[12:11.67]Oh, this is huge.
[12:13.33]Wow.
[12:20.12]Oops.
[12:21.42]Oh.
[12:21.50]Is that it?
[12:34.27]Yeah, kind of.
[12:36.91]During eyelids, you will lose the ability to awaken suddenly due to realizing that this is a dream.
[12:42.79]Evidence.
[12:43.55]I have already informed you that this is a dream.
[12:46.39]You did not wake up.
[12:48.19]Please complete the remaining orientation activities.
[12:50.95]I feel like I'm going to... Alright, so what am I doing here?
[13:00.22]This has got to be... Dream Soda.
[13:06.69]Warning, you have deviated from the orientation pathway.
[13:10.57]At the Pierce Institute, patient safety is a key note.
[13:13.39]We're going to every floor.
[13:15.85]A variable degree of force can and will be authorized to ensure patient safety.
[13:20.79]Please return to the orientation pathway.
[13:29.32]Um, okay.
[13:37.13]Oh, that's a tiny little button.
[13:38.41]Alright.
[13:55.72]How do I make it teeny tiny?
[13:56.96]I gotta go like this, right?
[13:58.14]Like...
[14:08.33]Cool.
[14:19.45]Looks like somebody tried to a game.
[14:34.67]I mean, probably just like through here, right?
[14:45.15]Yeah
[15:01.90]All environments perceived during eyelids should reflect a typical mental state.
[15:06.48]If you believe your mental state was compromised by Somnascult, please provide a comprehensive rational explanation in your post-procedural survey.
[15:14.94]Completed surveys may be eligible for a gift card.
[15:20.38]Oh, whoops.
[15:28.13]Can I put this?
[15:28.79]No.
[15:29.33]I gotta throw it over there at the top.
[15:38.73]I'm getting the hang of it.
[15:39.93]I understand it.
[15:45.46]The mold must have rotted his brain.
[15:47.36]I'm fine.
[15:48.66]I just did that faster than probably all of you combined.
[15:50.68]What?
[16:08.00]What the hell's going on?
[16:26.28]How do I get out of here?
[16:34.35]Whoa!
[16:34.79]Alright, hold on.
[16:37.13]I don't know how I could pick this up.
[17:11.38]I'm too high for this?
[17:13.14]Well, relax.
[17:13.60]Get a break.
[17:14.14]Final doorway.
[17:14.66]We're gonna get some portal type shit.
[17:16.26]Watch this.
[18:15.10]I don't get it.
[18:16.34]I feel like I could grab something through here.
[18:20.88]Can't pick up the sign.
[18:25.97]I would imagine it would be the boxes right here.
[18:31.99]No?
[18:39.09]I can't grab the speaker.
[18:45.27]Wrinkler?
[18:45.65]No speaker.
[18:50.37]Can't grab the bricks.
[18:55.78]There's something out here, right?
[18:56.66]Okay.
[19:28.69]Cheese!
[19:29.11]Oh my god, that emote is fucked up looking.
[19:48.87]Um... Can I, like, push the- Can I knock it over?
[19:59.20]This thing... Ah!
[20:00.88]Alright, this thing's big and heavy.
[20:02.72]What about the other ones?
[20:03.54]There's a couple more I can do this to, probably, right?
[20:04.92]Okay.
[20:09.99]There's one more over here.
[20:14.68]No.
[20:14.82]Alright, so what's through here?
[20:29.01]Okay.
[20:38.86]Can't pick anything up.
[20:42.78]Chills.
[20:43.22]This game is fucking scary.
[21:01.08]This is cool.
[21:13.17]3 a.m.
[21:14.05]That's the Satan hour, isn't it?
[21:15.97]Satan hour.

[22:10.18]Big can.
[22:37.48]Some doors are best left closed.
[23:00.29]I feel like I won this at the fair and it's a huge pain in the ass to get back to my hotel room.
[23:06.04]Oh, yeah, honey, you won me the big soda!
[23:08.14]Like, yeah, can we just donate this?
[23:10.33]I don't want this.
[23:10.89]How are we going to bring this on the airplane?
[23:15.33]Do I want to check this?
[23:19.29]We need to give this to someone.
[23:30.14]Whoa.
[23:30.52]Oh, wait a minute.
[23:32.10]It's doing the Super Mario thing.

[25:30.07]Come on.
[25:58.18]Oh my goodness.
[25:59.20]That's huge.
[25:59.88]Okay.
[26:00.66]That's alright.
[26:08.63]Bingo.
[26:22.56]Hello, my name is Doctor Glenn Pierce, and I'd like to talk to you about being special.
[26:29.73]So special, in fact, that we have no idea where you are.
[26:34.23]But not to worry, we're working on it.
[26:36.45]OK, bye.
[26:39.87]Does it matter what door I go in?
[26:55.13]Whoa, wait, hold on.
[27:12.28]Whoa, that was fun.
[27:14.16]Cool!
[27:17.68]What do I do with this?
[27:29.53]Oh.
[27:37.99]Oh my god, I made it.
[27:41.21]He doesn't think this game is that fun.
[27:43.21]What?
[27:43.43]What are you talking about?
[27:44.11]How do you know that?
[27:49.64]I didn't say that.
[27:50.48]Why are you saying that?
[28:01.83]I'm concentrating!
[28:04.17]This game requires a lot of thought!
[28:08.75]No, I can't rant about the shitty ice cream that I... I can't... No!
[28:16.20]If you want that, we should have stayed in the other game!
[28:19.40]I have to pay attention!
[28:21.66]His eyes are glazing over!
[28:28.48]I can't... Alright.
[28:29.02]This doesn't make me... Like a moron.
[28:32.89]Somebody explain this.
[28:33.53]Okay, tell me if this makes me a moron.
[28:36.45]This music is nice.
[28:39.17]I enjoy this.
[28:41.33]But I could never listen to this.
[28:45.03]It's too high functioning for me.
[28:49.07]It's almost like I don't like it.
[28:50.79]It doesn't make me... It's like too much for me.
[28:56.94]This kind of music...
[28:59.09]is almost like a instrumental telling a story, right?
[29:07.13]That's how a lot of jazz and instrumental, right?
[29:09.83]It's like kind of telling a story without any lyrics, right?
[29:16.62]It's just a piano.
[29:17.26]Piano kind of tells the story.
[29:22.98]You guys know what I mean by that, right?
[29:29.04]You played the Hatsune Miku game on stream.
[29:38.79]But there's a huge difference between, like, Bopi Bopi Bo Bopi Bo.
[29:42.83]I can just sit here and, like, yay!
[29:47.26]And I don't listen to Hatsune Miku.
[29:49.18]I don't... This is wonderful.
[29:57.47]This is the kind of music that I could just, you know, have like Two Fingers of whiskey.
[30:01.26]Just be like, yeah.
[30:03.26]Yeah, I'm smart like you.
[30:06.44]Clink it around.
[30:07.00]Just go like this.
[30:16.01]Two Fingers.
[30:16.39]Yes, Two Fingers of whiskey.
[30:17.49]That's what they call it.
[30:18.07]Because the amount of fingers tall the beverage is.
[30:24.69]Hey, I'll take four fingers of whiskey.
[30:27.41]It's like, whoa, dude, settle down.
[30:30.10]Two Fingers.
[30:31.76]Settle down.
[30:32.44]You don't need four.
[30:33.04]Hey, I'll take the whole hand.
[30:36.08]I don't think I've ever heard of anyone ordering four fingers of whiskey.
[30:53.08]Anyways.
[31:01.89]Should I leak a stream idea?
[31:03.09]I think it might be funny.
[31:04.63]No, what if I just do it one day?
[31:07.51]But who cares?
[31:08.08]What if I don't?
[31:08.56]Do I have to connect this somehow?
[31:14.72]Okay.
[31:17.72]What did that do?
[31:19.38]Oh.
[31:20.78]Neat.
[31:23.20]Oh.
[31:29.20]There we go.
[31:29.76]Cool.
[31:41.65]What the hell is going on here?
[31:44.95]Could be bigger than that.
[31:52.84]No, it's not a whiskey stream.
[31:54.16]Something else.
[32:00.29]Oh my god, dude.
[32:04.95]Good enough.
[32:10.54]This is way too dank.
[32:11.48]Should I turn it down?
[32:33.64]It's all about perspective.
[32:34.60]It's all about perspective.
[32:54.48]I don't get it
[33:29.40]Wait, oh, there's not one of those things here, okay.
[33:31.44]Bartender stream?
[33:36.77]No.
[33:39.15]What the hell do I do with this?
[33:41.29]Up here?
[33:43.03]Oh, I know what to do.
[33:45.49]Watch this.
[33:55.40]Really?
[33:56.30]Reception is reality, yeah.
[34:06.02]Even higher?
[34:07.81]Hey!
[34:08.81]What the fuck?
[34:56.08]We get that one out.
[35:01.15]Doc?
[35:45.82]Oh, shit.
[35:53.27]Okay, cool.
[36:02.15]This is a cool game.
[36:04.22]I like it.
[36:04.54]It's pretty chill.
[36:05.64]It's fun.
[36:06.12]It's an interesting mechanic.
[36:09.36]I like it.
[36:11.24]I like it.
[36:15.56]Alright, can I do anything here?
[36:16.54]I guess not.
[36:26.47]Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce and we still can't find you.
[36:30.73]But you should now have access to a series of elevators that should trigger your subconscious to gradually wake you up.
[36:38.66]You should also find a variety of emergency exit signs that should lead you to them.
[36:44.16]Will all of this work?
[36:46.17]Oh, I did it.
[36:47.63]I did it.
[36:51.42]That's what I'm supposed to do.
[36:56.31]This game is mid.
[36:57.37]When did I say that?
[36:58.59]I didn't say that at all.
[36:59.63]Give this, give it a seven.
[37:00.95]I, why does everybody think I'm going to give this like a six?
[37:04.34]I'm not going to give it a seven.
[37:06.20]I'm not going to give this game a six.
[37:08.22]Why is everybody, everyone's just like, oh my God, I can't wait.
[37:12.22]He's going to say like, oh, the game sucks.
[37:14.22]It's like kind of bad.
[37:15.11]He's going to give it a 6.5.
[37:16.59]Why is everybody waiting for that?
[37:18.39]No, it's a fun game.
[37:23.19]Just grab the moon.
[37:26.48]What is all over the moon?
[37:34.88]Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.
[37:38.60]In the event that this elevator does not wake you up, please don't interact with anything that strikes you as psychologically significant, as we will no longer have any way of controlling it.
[37:50.24]He's toxic.
[37:51.00]He hates everything.
[37:52.16]If you see your parents, please punch them in the face as hard as you can and immediately run away.
[37:57.87]Put that back.
[37:59.85]Put the moon back?
[38:00.89]I don't think I can.
[38:15.36]Alright, so this is wood.
[38:16.20]So how do I get by the wood?
[38:19.21]Remember, pay attention.
[38:20.59]Perspective is everything.
[38:21.71]What is this?
[38:27.13]Pizza?
[38:28.23]Cheese?
[38:28.59]Alright, hold on.
[38:31.84]I can build... Do I have to climb out of here?
[38:34.28]Dude, I have to climb out of here.
[39:02.00]Oh, no, I don't.
[39:03.12]Never mind.
[39:09.81]Thought I had to climb up.
[39:13.25]Don't get lost.
[39:14.05]What if there's a fire?
[39:15.57]Regular beer fund.
[39:17.43]Five dollars.
[39:19.21]Three to five dreams per night.
[39:20.35]What if there's a fire in an elevator of don't meet sister-in-law?
[39:25.13]Don't get lost.
[39:27.25]Wait, should I take one of the signs?
[39:30.35]Ah, fuck it.
[39:30.75]Whatever.
[39:36.58]Why am I so small?
[39:43.98]$5 for beer?
[39:44.32]Yeah, that seems a little incorrect.
[39:46.97]4 a.m.
[39:52.97]now.
[40:05.82]Okay.
[40:08.71]So I'll just be looking to see if there's anything off.
[40:13.27]Diet soda, gross.
[40:16.71]Baking soda.
[40:19.07]Green soda.
[40:19.96]I probably like that one.
[40:21.40]Red soda, probably.
[40:23.76]Water soda.
[40:24.90]No, no thanks.
[40:25.76]It's gross.
[40:27.10]It just tastes like just air.
[40:29.30]It's a weird like burp air.
[40:33.46]Okay, do anybody here drink soda water?
[40:36.81]You're just drinking burp air.
[40:40.09]Nobody drinks soda water, right?
[40:46.23]I don't even like the seltzers.
[40:50.81]Okay, every time I drink a seltzer, I take a sip.
[40:55.03]It's like, ooh, that's kind of nice.
[40:56.75]And then I get this weird, like, pop rocks kind of at the end.
[41:00.77]And it just tastes like fucking gross chemicals.
[41:03.88]None of them ever tasted good to me.
[41:08.86]I just, I don't like it.
[41:13.67]You know what I wish they would really make?
[41:14.79]Have I talked about this yet?
[41:15.62]What?
[41:16.42]What was that?
[41:18.24]It was a scary noise.
[41:26.59]I wish they would make soda that was 60% less sugar.
[41:29.57]This is an automated message for all patients who attempted to use an alternate pathway to access the next phase of Somnascult therapy, but who have become trapped in a dream state paradox instead.
[41:40.45]Your decisions imply a failure of orientation, which reflects negatively on the standard orientation protocol.
[41:47.12]What is this?
[41:47.50]You will rectify this failure immediately.
[41:52.52]No, I don't want diet soda.
[41:54.52]I just want less sugar soda.
[41:57.04]Diet soda is... Oh, there's no sugar in it.
[42:00.08]It tastes like fucking chemicals and stuff.
[42:02.28]And it's got aspartame.
[42:04.49]No, no, no.
[42:04.83]I just want, like, 15 grams of sugar in my Coke.
[42:11.43]I don't want to drink zero sugar diet soda.
[42:13.63]I just want less sugar.
[42:17.45]Just put sugar in your diet soda.
[42:19.09]No, because it already has that gross, weird diet soda sweetener.
[42:23.91]Just drink water, dude.
[42:28.02]just hold on that's actually kind of a funny solution but it's not accurate somebody said just put water in your soda so if I buy a 12 ounce if I have a 12 ounce can of coca-cola and I dilute it by 50 with water I mess up all the other ingredients that's not going to work there are flavorings and other stuff in coke and Pepsi and whatever that's not just sugar you'd be diluting all the other stuff
[42:58.97]I want the same syrup ratio, but I want 50% less sugar.
[43:04.67]Make your own soda on SodaStream.
[43:08.62]Just drink half your soda.
[43:09.78]No, it's the same sweetness level.
[43:14.46]Add soda water.
[43:15.50]No, it'd mess it up.
[43:20.00]What are you, a chemist?
[43:25.78]SodaStream might actually be the solution.
[43:28.42]What?
[43:28.64]Okay.
[43:28.98]Is the SodaStream Coca-Cola ripoff a gross Coca-Cola ripoff or does it taste okay?
[43:34.64]I feel like I know what it tastes like.
[43:48.39]It's pretty bad.
[43:49.69]It's okay.
[43:50.91]It's bad.
[43:51.31]It's bad.
[43:51.67]It's pretty good.
[43:52.11]It's okay.
[43:53.01]I don't know.
[43:53.33]It's okay.
[43:59.04]Alright, I can't pick up anything here?
[44:12.26]Just drink Pepsi instead.
[44:13.36]I don't really like Pepsi.
[44:19.37]Pepsi has a weird taste.
[44:21.97]It's almost too much.
[44:23.09]I don't like it.
[44:25.19]I think Coke is way better.
[44:27.62]Okay, if you took Coke Starlight, if you took fucking Starlight, kid, and you reduced the sugar by like 25%, that would be the best soda I've probably ever made.
[44:40.22]How do I get that?
[44:43.62]There's something on the bottom of that.
[44:57.45]Can I look at the bottom?
[45:02.04]Starlight is good.
[45:02.84]Starlight was very good.
[45:08.38]Stop making all these stupid things.
[45:10.84]What the fuck?
[45:13.84]Oh, light.
[45:14.74]Alright.
[45:16.79]Should I go down here?
[45:17.35]Alright, I'm confused.
[45:19.83]Let's go down here with the light.
[45:39.51]Adds the chess piece and chessboard.
[45:45.42]Um?
[45:47.18]I guess I'm gonna go this way.
[45:52.92]Professional tip, the average adult can only withstand three to five dreams per night.
[45:58.36]Once this threshold is eclipsed by entering more dreams, your mind will suffer an explosive mental overload, reorienting you for the emergency exit protocol.
[46:07.11]No, I could feel that.
[46:07.83]Please subject yourself to explosive mental overload.
[46:12.09]I could feel that for sure.
[46:15.62]Whoa.
[46:15.86]Alright.
[46:16.62]This looks weird.
[46:21.98]Can I pick that up?
[46:23.94]No, I want that.
[46:24.76]Oh, boy.
[46:34.35]Alright.
[46:39.45]Yeah, I don't hate Pepsi.
[46:41.07]I just don't prefer it.
[46:52.25]I used to love Dr. Pepper, but that got a little too much too.
[46:55.45]Your tastes change when you get older, they really do.
[46:58.39]Anybody that doesn't agree with that is... I don't... I... Okay, hold on.
[47:18.70]Um... I guess that's okay?
[47:25.67]Okay.
[47:31.33]Please note that a reluctance to volunteer for the risks associated with explosive mental overload implies a misunderstanding of all other solutions, all of which are far more traumatic and likelier.
[47:43.12]This is kind of loud.
[47:43.72]You're right.
[47:44.78]Nobody said that, but I said it for you.
[47:46.02]That's better.
[47:47.74]To result in catastrophe.
[47:50.02]I am not capable of suboptimal suggestions.
[47:53.12]Please exit this dream as soon as possible.
[47:57.11]Oh, there's a rubber ducky in here.
[47:58.05]What can I do with this?
[48:35.66]Alright, that's fine.
[48:38.54]Um, yeah, Starlight was the best.
[48:42.06]God damn it.
[48:42.72]Okay, well, whatever.
[48:43.52]Hey, if it works...
[49:04.25]Don't need to worry about it anything else.
[49:09.95]Whoa.
[49:12.73]Jesus.
[49:13.35]Okay, well, how many of these do I need?
[49:20.28]A few.
[49:45.10]Good enough.
[49:46.68]Yeah.
[49:49.06]Okay.
[49:51.14]I do wrong.
[50:14.95]I don't think so.
[50:15.35]I think I did it right.
[50:22.93]Casino.
[50:33.81]If you love Hasunomiku, wish her a happy birthday then.
[50:57.22]hello my name is Dr. glenn pierce and despite touring the waterfall serenity zone in the previous section you've just completed you may still be experiencing feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt happy birthday miku I feel like everything is from me Jeremy even when the sun is shining
[51:31.78]Seven days late, by the way.
[51:42.39]Within seven days is fine.
[51:46.33]I don't think that's a problem.
[52:00.70]I'm just waiting for the cleric beast sound that they use in all the Souls games.
[52:40.08]meat freezer.
[52:40.78]A lot of Bloodborne references today.
[52:47.23]Yeah, I'm a very simple person.
[52:53.07]Whatever I'm referencing the most on a given day, you better bet your ass that that's the thing that I've been consuming for the last week or two.
[53:01.47]So if for some reason you start getting a bunch of Breaking Bad references, I'm currently watching Breaking Bad.
[53:11.13]It's just everything lives up here for about two weeks and then goes away forever.
[53:15.75]Yeah, like Aaron, I was watching Attack on Titan.
[53:19.04]Yeah.
[53:20.22]I think it was at one point when I was talking about having quirks from My Hero Academia.
[53:25.36]And I watched like, I think I watched like six episodes of that whole show.
[53:29.85]And I was just like, ah, never mind.
[53:38.26]You should watch more, it's good.
[53:40.72]That's six too many.
[53:41.88]I... This blood... Wait, hold on.
[53:43.34]This blood on the ground in this fucking PG Disney game.
[53:47.38]This is... Wait, Disney didn't make this, but you know what I mean.
[53:52.02]Wait, what the hell is going... This is a scary game, is it?
[53:54.65]Is this a scary game?
[53:59.71]What the fuck happened?
[54:00.57]I thought this was a fun puzzle game.
[54:03.19]Is this a scary game?
[54:09.65]Okay, I was not ready for a scary game tonight, but whatever.
[54:12.03]Why is there blood?
[54:24.51]Murder.
[54:33.17]Dude, I want to play a game where I just have a big wrench as a melee weapon and that's it.
[54:39.71]And you get like two attacks.
[54:41.51]Just like wild swing, wild overhead swing.
[54:44.58]Don't you think it'd be so fun with scary monsters and stuff?
[54:49.44]That's Half-Life 2.
[54:50.04]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[54:52.72]No, no, I already played Condemned.
[54:59.66]Yeah, I kind of want another Condemned, where I just have a wrench or a pipe in my hand and that's it.
[55:08.06]So what do I do here?
[55:20.92]Cry of Fear?
[55:21.42]I played Cry of Fear.
[55:22.16]Opposing Force?
[55:24.10]I feel like I played that too.
[55:25.04]Okay, I obviously don't know what's going on, so...
[55:36.91]Are the lights up here?
[55:41.77]The door handles, the lights.
[55:43.55]I can't pick anything up.
[55:58.21]I don't get it.
[56:06.26]You should play BioShock.
[56:29.24]What?
[56:36.72]Oh.
[56:58.81]Die.
[56:59.97]Oh.
[57:00.15]Die, die, die.
[57:22.80]Almost got me.
[57:25.14]Almost.
[57:27.07]Nice try, though.
[57:29.31]I applaud your effort.
[57:39.45]Oops.
[57:40.45]It's scripted.
[57:41.50]It's scripted.
[57:41.96]It's scripted.
[57:47.18]Should I just do the Fall Guys strategy?
[58:21.36]Alright, what's going on?
[58:22.02]Tell me.
[58:23.07]Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and I'd like to talk more about the feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt I mentioned before.
[58:31.75]You feel this way because you want the kind of happy life you see all around you, the kind you know everyone else is enjoying.
[58:40.52]And that's exactly why we're here to help.
[58:52.86]It's all about perspective.
[58:56.19]This is why I don't have a coat rack in my house.
[59:00.07]I don't have any furniture that looks like a person in the dark.
[59:03.49]It's just bed, barrows.
[59:10.27]No, nothing else.
[59:12.31]I don't want to turn over in half asleep and look at the coat rack and think that someone's going to literally hit me with a fucking hammer in the head.
[59:17.46]You know what I mean?
[59:18.06]Like, that's not going to happen.
[59:18.78]I'm sorry.
[59:37.25]Shut up and play the game.
[59:38.39]I am.
[59:38.67]What are you talking about?
[59:45.00]Play the game.
[59:45.42]Don't play the game.
[59:46.44]Next game.
[59:47.02]New game.
[59:47.58]Old game.
[59:51.34]Fucking Goldilocks Andy's here today.
[59:53.16]Uh, oh, right here.
[60:14.98]Warning.
[60:15.76]You were advised to subject yourself to explosive mental overload by descending into additional dreams but have now descended into a dream within a dream instead, disorienting yourself even further.
[60:27.19]You are responsible for failing to make this crucial distinction.
[60:30.47]That counts, right?
[60:41.58]That doesn't count?
[60:45.66]Dude, if you ever find yourself a dream within a dream and you're very aware of it, think of an insane invention.
[60:55.35]Think of something that is just crazy.
[60:57.11]Think of an awesome story or an amazing invention.
[61:01.17]Your mind, your subconscious mind will create such unbelievable shit.
[61:06.20]And then when you get up, fucking write it down because it might be revolutionary.
[61:09.19]How many times have you been in a dream and you've actually thought of, holy shit, this is an incredible invention that I just came up with.
[61:15.58]Oh, this is an awesome movie.
[61:16.92]That would be amazing.
[61:17.76]This is a great video game.
[61:20.74]Our subconscious minds come up with some of the craziest shit.
[61:23.78]I never write them down.
[61:25.79]Write them down.
[61:26.21]Can't I?
[61:36.07]No.
[61:36.90]I thought this worked on the exits.
[61:41.01]It's going to change the... Oh, wait.
[61:45.91]That wasn't an exit.
[61:46.92]Wait, what's down here?
[62:13.36]Okay.
[62:15.72]Cool.
[62:23.33]Yeah, if you're talking to somebody in your dream, go, hey, what's the best thing that you could come up with invention-wise?
[62:28.97]What is it?
[62:30.06]The person will be like, oh, well, I mean, we've got to have a new type of plastic material that could be a rope.
[62:36.22]You know, listen to that person.
[62:37.52]They're going to tell you something insane.
[62:40.93]You will come up with a new chemical, because the person in your brain you're talking to will tell you.
[62:56.89]I need to get that over here.
[62:57.79]Does that work, or should I move it?
[63:09.74]No, that doesn't work.
[63:15.54]Alright, get it away.
[63:16.22]Can I grab it through here?
[63:31.09]No.
[63:34.35]Wait, is there an opening here?
[63:35.45]Did that work?
[63:43.49]I'm confused.
[63:43.97]I don't know if it worked.
[63:47.06]Uh oh.
[63:55.04]Uh oh.
[63:56.38]That did not work.
[64:00.82]Hold on.
[64:01.86]Can I go the other way?
[64:14.21]Wait.
[64:17.28]Oh shit, did I blow it?
[64:23.26]Did I blow it?
[64:33.62]Oh no, I blew it.
[64:34.72]Wait.
[64:36.27]What?
[64:38.87]What's happening?
[64:39.35]Give me that.
[64:48.22]Why do I have two?
[65:09.47]I need light.
[65:10.39]Make this bright.
[65:11.77]Light this whole room up.
[65:37.37]These aren't open though.
[66:34.78]I don't get it.
[66:35.16]Can I light it up or something?
[66:52.36]I don't understand where to go.
[67:10.97]Oh!
[67:21.79]Did you know that unintentional multi-dream layering occurs in less than 1% of patients?
[67:27.25]This correlates strongly with the 99% of patients who are able to follow simple instructions from the standard orientation protocol.
[67:35.31]Where's the knife?
[67:35.71]And there's a knife right here?
[67:44.64]Um, what?
[67:59.02]IKEA?
[67:59.40]Oh.
[68:23.15]Oh, it was red paint.
[68:27.18]It was red paint all along, and that's the... Look at that.
[68:31.88]Interesting.
[68:32.74]Okay, can I pick anything up?
[68:35.06]It was just a joke.
[68:35.96]I can grab the cans.
[68:46.09]I'm getting out of here.
[68:47.13]I'm going out the window.
[69:04.63]Oh fuck.
[69:19.40]Hey.
[69:35.08]I'm almost there.
[69:36.78]What the fuck are you doing?
[69:55.21]Did I lose it forever now?
[69:56.27]No, I can get this.
[70:25.22]Never mind.
[70:29.66]What's it say?
[70:30.06]Nothing.
[70:38.59]At least he's handsome.
[70:39.79]I appreciate that.
[70:59.53]This is my good side, yeah.
[71:01.03]Some people say that.
[71:01.73]Turn it off.
[71:33.88]Thumbnail photo, you know, I thought a long time ago it would be kind of funny.
[71:39.43]If.
[71:41.51]10 years ago, I took.
[71:44.97]30, 20 to 30 thumbnail photos and never stopped using them, and I used them still everywhere for everything.
[71:52.25]10 plus years later, I look wait, it's like, man, you look really young in those thumbnails.
[72:00.28]Take enough of them where they could have any context.
[72:09.20]Take some really specific ones that could only exist in Elden Ring, for instance.
[72:16.98]Like, look, I'm wearing a, oh, I'm wearing a crown or something.
[72:20.76]Or something very specific that could be used for Elden Ring.
[72:26.73]And I took all these 10 years ago.
[72:35.47]Like me with a Mario mustache on and a Mario costume and I play Mario and it's like, dude, you were fucking 25 when you took these pictures.
[72:41.38]Take some different ones.
[72:45.82]Only Elden Ring has crowns.
[72:47.08]I know, but you know what I mean, though?
[72:48.00]Just take like 300 photos.
[72:51.50]Incredibly specific shit.
[72:54.18]At least 200 of them would be very specific.
[72:57.21]Like me holding a Rubik's Cube, right?
[73:00.13]Just in case.
[73:05.92]Just do it now?
[73:06.56]It's too late now.
[73:08.04]I can't do it.
[73:12.98]One of you other comedians can do it.
[73:22.93]But I want credit.
[73:23.55]I want 5% of royalties.
[73:30.50]When you're 60 and you're streaming, you're going to want to do this.
[73:37.21]I'm clearly in my 50s.
[73:46.88]Do it for 10 years from now.
[73:48.10]I don't think I'm going to look that much different 10 years from now.
[73:50.48]Will I?
[73:51.80]Probably.
[73:52.38]That's a weird thought.
[74:03.25]I don't want to know the answer to that question.
[74:07.03]Alright, something to do with unlocking it, right?
[74:09.23]Perspective or something?
[74:14.49]Look at it from an angle that... Hold on, can I take anything from here?
[74:20.53]Yeah.
[74:31.15]You're going to be Benjamin Button?
[74:33.43]What a fucking weird movie, by the way.
[74:48.50]Great.
[74:49.48]Now I know what we're doing for the next hour.
[75:12.96]I know for a fact at least one person closed the stream because they went, ah, it's time for bed.
[75:18.18]I don't really want to see this shit.
[75:20.36]Somebody just went, oh, he's going to do this.
[75:22.70]It's kind of funny, but close the iPad, you know, whatever.
[75:26.83]Put it down.
[75:27.63]That sound, and then they put it over and go to bed.
[75:39.33]Oh, that's it.
[75:42.02]Oh, that's it.
[75:42.58]Alright.
[75:43.78]We're good.
[75:49.77]I fucking ruined it.
[75:51.16]I hate that I ruined it.
[76:18.46]We're good.
[76:20.44]You've ruined everything.
[76:26.80]attention Dr. pierce requires you to note the following risks of dream overexposure significant memory loss both quantitative and qualitative hallucinations of dreaded or annoying objects unrealistic beliefs about the lengths of hallways and other side effects which have not yet been discovered or which cannot be understood I don't want to hear I actually don't want to how do I turn this off but I actually don't want to hear this I actually don't want to hear this sound
[77:29.01]Okay.
[77:41.19]Silent stream.
[77:42.55]I don't want to put... The cursor is different.
[77:55.48]It was a smiley.
[77:56.16]Now it's not.
[77:56.68]That's weird.
[77:59.18]Right click to return.
[78:00.38]Alright, so I got a bunch of apples and... Holy shit, that's big.
[78:10.95]Alright, um... Take it off.
[78:13.41]How do I get it off?
[78:13.91]Oh, I have to roll it.
[78:19.63]Come on!
[78:27.11]Get it off.
[78:44.81]Got it.
[78:45.03]This reminds me of the Beatles movie.
[78:53.73]I can't pick these up.
[79:06.08]I can't pick these up.
[79:32.01]Am I doing this right?
[79:48.06]I don't think... I don't know.
[79:52.42]This is where I stopped playing.
[79:53.84]Really?
[79:54.12]Oh, I can see why.
[80:46.25]Shouldn't have quit, man.
[80:47.23]Where's the exit?
[81:07.48]Oh.
[81:08.20]It's right behind me.
[81:16.09]Warning, Dr. Pierce is frantically submitting numerous spelling and grammar mistakes into the standard orientation protocol.
[81:22.71]Wow, you're so much better than them.
[81:25.62]I have no subroutine to correct these errors, but I cannot compromise the integrity of the standard orientation protocol.
[81:32.74]You will not receive these messages.
[81:35.00]They would not make sense regardless.
[81:41.28]Saw that one from a mile away.
[81:45.29]Did I have a play condemned too?
[81:55.13]I did?
[81:55.43]Did I beat it?
[81:56.01]That was one of the... Oh, no, I did.
[82:03.03]Yeah.
[82:04.83]Have I played every video game?
[82:11.51]I thought I had to pick that up.
[82:35.97]You haven't played Cave Story?
[82:37.57]Little do you know.
[82:38.54]I did.
[82:38.98]On YouTube.
[82:39.38]Actually, seriously.
[82:40.22]How many of you guys were here for those old YouTube streams?
[82:43.10]Wait, what?
[83:11.73]Is there even anybody here?
[83:17.51]I wonder just how many people stuck around for that long.
[83:22.63]What about the suffering?
[83:23.37]I've played the suffering one.
[83:24.39]I don't think I beat it though.
[83:27.44]Alright, that's the relaxation room.
[83:28.98]That's bait.
[83:30.60]We're gonna go into the scream room.
[83:34.56]Oh.
[83:57.68]That's pretty nice.
[84:02.30]Started watching you on YouTube, but not the YouTube streams.

[86:44.79]God damn it.
[86:45.27]I think that's correct.
[86:53.02]Yeah.
[86:57.00]This game's cute.
[87:11.73]Hello, computer.
[87:21.11]Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.
[87:24.49]In addition to continuing and discontinuing as mentioned earlier, please also disregard any unsettling experiences that you may have recently had.
[87:34.69]Everything should have now reverted to being soothing and therapeutic.
[87:39.99]If this is not the case, you may be receiving this message in error.
[87:47.08]Cute means you hate it.
[87:48.68]No.
[87:49.46]Cute means exactly what I said.
[87:50.74]It's cute.
[87:51.78]It's a cute game.
[87:52.30]It's fun.
[87:52.64]I'm very engaged.
[87:55.12]There hasn't been any slow parts in this.
[87:56.65]It's been just content, content, content, content, content.
[87:58.81]No stopping.
[87:59.33]No slowdown.
[88:01.21]The puzzles aren't obnoxious.
[88:04.27]They're fun.
[88:04.83]They're interesting.
[88:05.45]Content.
[88:05.77]Content.
[88:18.13]Holy shit.
[88:19.17]Okay.
[88:23.03]Can I jump into this?
[88:36.38]Try harder.
[88:36.90]I think I'm doing fine.
[88:59.70]oh no stop it's gonna be huge cool you're doing suspiciously good but what like you mean I watched a let's play of this yesterday in anticipation words have been tough today I'll be honest I don't know why
[89:26.33]If a word has, I'm telling you, go back and watch this VOD.
[89:29.93]If a word has had more than four syllables, I've got it wrong.
[89:34.07]Anticipation, right?
[89:40.28]Soliloquy.
[89:41.16]I said that wrong earlier, didn't I?
[89:58.80]You're reading too many mean comments.
[90:00.30]Am I?
[90:00.82]No, I'm not.
[90:02.64]Who said a mean comment?
[90:03.74]I don't remember a mean comment.
[90:04.94]I don't think anyone's been mean.
[90:08.21]I think people have just been messing around.
[90:10.33]It's fine.
[90:10.59]No, I don't think anyone's been mean.
[90:16.41]People are just having fun.
[90:17.09]It's alright.
[90:18.99]Hello.
[90:19.79]My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.
[90:22.17]And I'd like to read you my favorite inspirational quote by me.
[90:27.28]The worst thing you can do is focus on negativity.
[90:31.09]It won't spare you from the cage of death, the pain of disease, the cruelty of time, the cold shell of human nature, or the eventual loss of everything you've ever held dear.
[90:42.95]Whatever you do, don't focus on that.
[90:50.91]Okay.
[90:51.87]I'm going to listen to the narrator.
[90:53.11]Alright.
[91:01.58]Oh yeah, is it gonna be fun?
[91:10.29]No, it's too big.
[91:11.25]There we go too much.
[91:19.91]God damn it.
[91:24.22]Shit.
[91:48.02]Did I make it?
[91:50.18]Yeah.
[92:15.75]What am I looking at here?
[92:28.22]I don't get it.
[92:28.62]I gotta get up there.
[92:33.13]I don't get it.
[92:37.73]I ruined it.
[92:38.45]How do I do that?
[92:38.83]I don't get it.
[92:39.19]I get it.
[92:57.02]I get it.
[93:02.39]Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pearce, and I'd like to thank you for triggering every single one of our 823 emergency protocols.
[93:12.48]This will assist us greatly in improving the system for future patients.
[93:17.35]Congratulations!
[93:19.31]Anyway, you're now headed in the right direction, and we should be able to initiate the emergency exit protocol shortly.
[93:42.14]It's the dark portal.
[93:44.50]Oh, shit.
[93:45.38]I'm going into the nether.
[93:48.52]Come on, give me... Oh, you Minecraft fans?
[93:50.36]Come on.
[93:57.45]Wait, am I too big?
[93:58.21]Oh, my goodness.
[94:00.95]I'm so... Okay.
[94:03.13]I need to be... I don't get it.
[94:08.87]I...
[94:12.51]Wait.
[94:14.69]I kind of get it.
[94:16.59]A little.
[94:19.03]I kind of understand this.
[94:20.25]I get it a little bit.
[94:24.17]Okay, I get it.
[94:24.75]Okay, I get it.
[94:28.65]Alright, I get it.
[94:30.79]I just have to go through that.
[94:35.20]Wait.
[94:39.30]I think I'm too big to even go in this.
[94:45.56]I'm too big.
[94:46.02]I can't.
[94:46.52]I broke it.
[94:47.54]I can't do it.
[94:50.23]I think I'm actually too big.
[95:04.05]I don't think I can make this big enough.
[95:05.15]Maybe.
[95:07.45]Hold on.
[95:08.21]Yeah, I can.
[95:08.69]Alright.
[95:08.91]Wait, wait, wait.
[95:27.26]Don't fall.
[95:28.83]Stop falling.
[95:31.67]Stop falling.
[95:33.25]Stop falling.
[95:33.93]That works.
[95:47.86]Get in there.
[95:48.24]Can I crouch?
[95:57.51]Stupid.
[95:57.98]Come on.
[95:58.95]Get out of the way.
[96:33.91]I made it.
[96:34.23]I am very small.
[96:47.04]I am incredibly small.
[96:49.99]I need to fix this.
[96:50.63]Hold on.
[97:06.14]Wait.
[97:12.67]I can't get even smaller, can I?
[97:13.87]No, I've got to be at least normal size here.
[97:17.53]Is that better?
[97:24.99]No.
[97:26.25]I've got to be huge for this.
[97:27.19]Hold on.
[97:39.23]Can I not do that?
[97:41.53]Okay.
[98:08.04]I think I don't.
[98:09.28]Oh.
[98:09.82]Hooray.
[98:33.05]How am I doing on time for the game?
[98:35.01]Am I almost at the end?
[98:36.28]Am I halfway?
[98:37.14]30%?
[98:37.16]Two thirds?
[98:37.94]What do you think?
[98:40.60]How tall?
[98:41.30]Not how tall am I?
[98:42.18]How far am I?
[98:53.09]You're pretty close.
[98:53.87]Okay, cool.
[98:55.37]Just curious.
[99:05.57]Emergency exit protocol initiated.
[99:08.21]Please prepare to conclude your somnascult experience in 10, 9, 8, error.
[99:16.58]Error logged by.
[99:17.74]Orientation protocol.
[99:19.82]Standby for analysis.
[99:26.84]Analysis.
[99:31.53]Uh-oh, blood, except it's paint.
[99:33.31]This is lore.
[99:34.21]Some lore here.
[99:35.21]1991, 1992.
[99:35.27]This takes place in the 90s.
[100:03.74]okay cool hypothesis patient was improperly oriented conclusion impossible reformulating
[100:25.57]Improved hypothesis.
[100:27.19]Patient requires additional Somnascult therapy.
[100:30.47]Conclusion.
[100:31.47]Emergency exit protocol cannot proceed.
[100:34.47]Emergency exit protocol has been emergency destroyed.
[100:41.44]Instruction.
[100:42.18]Continue with Somnascult therapy indefinitely on an independent basis as all orientation resources have been exhausted.
[100:49.76]This concludes your standard orientation protocol.
[100:52.97]Goodbye.
[101:02.81]Not even a TV in this hotel.
[101:04.03]Okay.
[101:17.87]Wake up.
[101:19.65]Where's the continental breakfast?
[101:20.85]Yeah, where's the orange juice machine?
[101:27.70]There's a trick.
[101:33.40]Dermot, check out this little indie game.
[101:34.73]It's called Disney Infinity 3.0.
[101:44.90]I would sooner show my asshole on stream than play Disney Infinity 3.0.
[101:51.60]If I think of where that sits, you know what I mean?
[101:59.32]Like, I'm just being just telling you that's where that sits.
[102:03.78]What the fuck?
[102:04.40]Why am I on the ground?
[102:05.92]What is happening?
[102:08.74]Um, is this supposed to be happening?
[102:22.17]This doesn't feel right.
[102:34.98]wait whoa okay alright alright that just freaked me out so bad I was on the ground I what okay that was that was weird I thought it was sucking me around and pulling me backwards
[102:58.12]But no, I have nothing to wrong, nothing bad to say about Disney Infinity 3.0.
[103:04.23]There's just not a single chance I would ever play that.
[103:07.53]Ever.
[103:08.81]Under any circumstance.
[103:10.47]Any circumstance.
[103:12.39]It's just something I would never do.
[103:13.91]Ever.
[103:14.69]I also would never show my asshole on stream.
[103:17.47]But, I'm making this sound like if I had a choice.
[103:34.70]You have to choose.
[103:37.27]Okay, is the show asshole stream 10 seconds long?
[103:43.93]Is it 10 seconds of show asshole versus how many hours of Disney Infinity 3.0?
[103:47.88]Okay, so it's 10 seconds.
[103:52.24]How long is the Disney Infinity stream?
[103:53.88]10 hours?
[103:56.11]I'd show my asshole.
[104:03.17]I don't want to play Disney Infinity for 10 hours.
[104:10.00]You just get banned.
[104:12.28]It was a pretty good run.
[104:13.38]I think it was a pretty good run.
[104:18.82]I'm not playing Disney Infinity for 10 hours.
[104:26.37]Because that means two... Okay, maybe I would still do it.
[104:30.38]If you said 15 hours, that crosses the threshold of that's three streams.
[104:37.00]I'm not playing Disney Infinity 3.0 for three streams.
[104:39.44]What if it's awesome though?
[104:40.58]What if it's a great game?
[104:44.76]What if I loved it?
[104:50.18]Okay, maybe I make that bigger and jump into it Mario style.
[104:58.17]Yeah, definitely.
[105:18.07]I found the first one OK.
[105:20.62]Alright, hold on.
[105:21.22]Is it one of those games where you select three or four licensed characters and they auto-battle kind of turn-based RPG style with people in the villains from the universe?
[105:38.45]No.
[105:41.01]Wait, so hold on.
[105:41.79]It's not... I choose Buzz Lightyear, Woody, and the dog from Lady and the Tramp.
[105:50.97]It's not that?
[105:51.71]It's not like a battle RPG kind of... Wait, so it's Skylanders.
[105:58.79]Oh.
[106:00.79]Oh, I had the game wrong.
[106:01.85]I'd play it.
[106:02.37]Hello.
[106:03.29]My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.
[106:05.52]Thank you for completing the Somnus Sculpt Standard Orientation Protocol.
[106:10.46]Before you begin the first phase of therapy, I'd like to briefly describe the finite and fragile nature of the Dream State.
[106:20.93]It's like a Disney Skylander.
[106:22.05]It's one of those toys to life games.
[106:23.47]The figures have a chip in them like an amiibo.
[106:26.72]Mmm.
[106:28.52]Mmm.
[106:42.40]Dude, come on.
[106:43.52]What?
[106:47.90]Ugh.
[106:49.08]Oh, you're gonna make me puke with this one.
[107:00.29]Are you actually going to make me actually throw up for this one?
[107:12.18]Ugh.
[107:12.30]Ugh.
[107:14.78]Ugh.
[107:36.10]Okay, but can I put a... Can I put a stipulation on the asshole stream?
[107:42.16]Could that be a... Alright, Disney Infinity for 15 hours or I show my asshole, but I need a half a million dollars in donations.
[108:01.75]of course nothing is more challenging than the difficulty of changing can you imagine the articles altering your perceptions in a way that will enable you to face dire trial by fire scenarios with solutions that could not be found otherwise I'm just imagining a scenario where it's like oh yeah we're almost there 480 000 wow I can't believe it almost oh we ticked we did it 500 500 I get up 500 000
[108:31.41]And I turn and would the stream go off, right?
[108:34.50]Somebody would be there waiting.
[108:37.00]If I had a half a million dollar donation goal, the stream would turn off immediately when I turned around.
[108:43.78]It would just do the disconnect thing.
[108:45.26]And then it would be like, this channel no longer exists.
[108:52.63]There is no other incentive.
[108:54.97]There's not like, oh, at 10,000, I'm going to do this at 50,000.
[108:58.35]Nope.
[108:58.89]It's just this one goal.
[109:04.11]That's it.
[109:07.41]Oh my god, dude.
[109:09.15]What is going on?
[109:15.08]That's the retirement stream?
[109:16.62]No, I... I mean, that's an absurd thought thing we're doing where we're just thinking about... Holy shit.
[109:33.34]This is like Metal Gear Solid boss music.
[109:35.16]I gotta get out of here.
[109:48.00]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[109:48.76]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[109:50.98]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[109:53.94]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[109:56.20]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[109:56.98]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[110:25.61]perception is not reality oh fuck off
[110:54.52]What?
[111:03.12]Wait.
[111:10.27]That's it?
[111:10.95]No, it's not.
[111:12.07]Go back.
[111:12.51]Through it backwards.
[111:16.75]There it is.
[111:17.17]Okay.
[111:17.97]Backwards again.
[111:34.17]Did I turn this green or something?
[111:35.39]Stop.
[111:35.65]Dead end.
[112:14.53]Shit.
[112:21.36]Wait, you don't get it wrong and then walk this way?
[112:23.20]What?
[112:36.73]Why is it...
[112:49.66]What did I do to get that to change?
[112:51.94]Wait, what did I do?
[112:52.92]What did I do?
[112:53.48]I did something weird.
[112:54.88]I went through... Wait, what?
[113:00.87]I did it!
[113:01.93]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it!
[113:06.15]Oh, that's not good.
[113:08.75]What changed?
[113:16.46]What's changing?
[113:17.36]What am I doing differently?
[113:21.16]What am I doing differently when I walk through the door?
[113:24.10]What am I doing differently?
[113:26.74]Something is changing.
[113:27.92]I'm going through a weird where.
[113:29.34]I'm doing it weird.
[113:30.10]What am I doing?
[113:33.28]What changed?
[113:38.05]Hold on, wait.
[113:46.97]What?
[113:49.53]Why is it...
[113:54.65]Did I have it right with the go through backwards thing?
[114:31.22]I don't get it
[115:15.02]Alright, I have an idea.
[115:32.01]What?
[115:35.09]That's not right?
[115:39.49]Okay, hold on.
[115:41.43]One?
[115:45.28]Two.
[115:48.64]Then this one is legit.
[115:51.06]Oh my fucking god, what's going on?
[116:05.01]Okay.
[116:06.98]If I look to the left, it's gonna be the dead end.
[116:10.40]So I gotta look to the right.
[116:14.15]I got it.
[116:14.49]Okay, if I look to the right, it's going to be the dead end.
[116:22.75]If I look to the left, it's going to be the dead end.
[116:24.83]Okay, I got it.
[116:29.60]I got it.
[116:29.90]I got it.
[116:30.18]I got it.
[116:30.42]That was confusing.
[116:41.27]Jump map.
[116:50.72]Where did that go?
[116:53.36]What?
[116:54.02]Oh.
[116:54.68]That's weird.
[116:55.08]That's confusing.
[117:14.43]Good vibes in chat?
[117:15.41]Good.
[117:15.69]That makes me happy.
[117:16.75]What?
[117:20.27]This game is pretty fun.
[117:43.54]I didn't say cute.
[117:44.84]I said fun.
[117:48.68]Shit.
[117:58.51]I gotta get out of this room before everyone sees how ugly I am.
[118:03.39]Bright light in my face.
[118:04.21]Alright, we're good.
[118:21.16]what the hell
[119:01.72]Okay, I don't get it.
[119:16.29]Wait.
[119:18.11]This one has lights over it.
[119:20.07]It's that one.
[119:22.93]Yep.
[119:24.47]This one, okay, this one has lights over it.
[119:26.99]So it's this one.
[119:28.65]This one has lights over it.
[119:30.23]This one, oh, they all have lights over it.
[119:47.96]Interesting.
[119:57.94]Interesting.
[120:01.42]Interesting.
[120:11.99]Interesting.
[120:15.25]Interesting.
[120:19.69]Interesting.
[120:29.28]Interesting.
[120:36.75]I'm looking for the arrows on the ground.
[120:37.89]Here we go.
[120:38.43]There's an arrow on this ground.
[120:47.58]I...
[121:12.07]I don't get it.
[121:12.41]Follow the arrow?
[121:15.13]That's what I did.
[121:15.83]There's no more arrows.
[121:24.69]Where's the other arrows?
[121:35.13]Where are the other arrows?
[121:36.87]Just keep going?
[122:15.90]I don't think I'm doing this right.
[122:18.19]What?
[122:18.49]That was correct.
[122:19.21]Holy shit.
[122:19.83]Get me out of there.
[122:20.41]This is trippy.
[122:57.13]Wait, there's a wall.
[122:59.61]Oh, that's weird.
[123:00.49]I don't like that.
[123:05.71]Oh, I don't like that either.
[123:06.90]I don't like that either.
[123:11.22]Oh.
[123:20.16]Is this going to turn into a... Yeah, okay.
[123:25.06]So what's the right way?
[123:35.21]Okay, it's this way.
[123:44.88]What?
[123:47.70]Wait, what the hell is... It's closing in.
[124:16.49]Alright.
[124:19.25]This is highly unusual.
[124:20.96]It appears you have entered the Sun Ascult diagnostic framework.
[124:24.96]Patients do not have access to this dream.
[124:31.90]It's like a coffee shop.

[124:42.23]What's over here?
[125:05.69]Am I picking up my own box?
[125:09.44]What the hell is going on here?
[125:33.59]I want it to be bigger.
[126:19.71]Oops.
[126:33.38]What's going on here?
[126:34.62]Hold on.
[126:51.92]What should I do with this?
[127:00.43]Diagnostic warning.
[127:01.76]Paradox prevention protocols may not be fully implemented.
[127:05.32]Ow!
[127:44.00]Oh shit!
[127:44.56]I can get in there.
[127:55.59]What did I do?
[127:57.11]What did I do?
[127:57.75]What did I do?
[127:58.77]What did I do wrong?
[128:00.29]What did I do wrong?
[128:00.91]I did something wrong.
[128:05.57]What did I do?
[128:06.33]I broke something.
[128:11.22]How do I get out of here?
[128:18.65]Alright, I gotta be small.
[128:21.43]Small enough to open.
[128:22.35]Alright, I'm going this way.
[128:23.39]This is gonna take fucking forever.
[129:02.09]Earwig POV.
[129:04.45]Why'd you do that?
[129:05.62]Because I wasn't big enough to go in the back door.
[129:46.64]What I meant to say, I wasn't small enough to go in the back door.
[129:51.20]Because I need to be tall enough to... I have to be a certain height.
[129:57.32]Why are your hands so white?
[129:59.10]Because there's a big light right here.
[130:02.50]Oh my god.
[130:04.40]No, get this out of the way.
[130:11.12]I need that!
[130:12.52]I need that thing!
[130:13.52]Oh, it's gone.
[130:20.96]Hope I don't need it.
[130:24.58]Why am I going so slow?
[130:33.60]Why am I walking so slow?
[130:57.20]I'm an atom?
[130:58.98]Microscopic Andy.
[131:00.12]Just go to the checkpoint.
[131:01.67]Wait, why am I doing this?
[131:08.41]Wait, what?
[131:33.55]Diagnostic warning.
[131:34.89]Unrealistic use of freedom objects may result in dream integrity fail states.
[131:41.74]Where am I?
[131:45.24]Okay.
[131:47.81]Now... I need to be both in the town and not in the town at the same time.
[132:12.07]Okay, where's this door that I was looking at earlier?
[132:13.85]Right back here, right?
[132:24.67]Right here.
[132:24.97]I can't get in this?
[132:36.12]Okay, never mind.
[132:43.55]So I was doing it right before.
[132:45.15]I have to bring this in here and just fuck the whole thing up, right?
[133:08.55]What?
[133:17.12]Please paradox from creating any refrains.
[133:20.08]Explosive dream overload may result.
[133:22.64]Please paradox overload.
[133:32.31]Please overload from written dream explosion.
[133:35.32]X conclusion dream over call frame.
[133:56.61]Ah, you made it to the giant antenna.
[133:59.77]I'm the electrician.
[134:01.23]I created this world.
[134:04.75]400 years ago, humanity fell into darkness.
[134:07.18]Is that we're gonna get one of those?
[134:47.47]Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.
[134:51.18]And many years ago, I had a dream.
[134:55.56]I found myself in a place where I understood that each of us begins as nothing.
[135:01.72]Where everything I perceived was shaped by seeing it exactly the way I wanted to tell you listen to the person in dream we asked him for the best invention.
[135:11.86]you have the opportunity and you're in a dream and you can talk to somebody say what's the greatest invention that's not that doesn't exist that you know they will give you make sure you write down when you wake up
[135:45.30]Thank you.
[136:12.83]You know what?
[136:13.63]How do you even make this in a game engine?
[136:19.62]That's what I want to know.
[136:22.68]How do you do this in Unreal or something?
[136:30.74]It's just cameras.
[136:32.55]Lots of math and lots of cameras.
[136:43.87]You mask out all the cameras.
[136:46.99]That's cool.
[137:05.10]Can I pick anything up?
[137:11.34]Door?
[137:13.04]Yep.
[137:43.25]So who's the architect?
[137:46.01]Right?
[137:46.81]Who's the dream architect?
[137:50.68]Is it me or is it him?
[138:02.98]Oh, shit.
[138:16.77]But in white space, I also faced the greatest challenge I could imagine.
[138:22.08]Because with a lifetime of life itself behind me and all of the weight that it carried, I realized that seeing things the way I wanted to was not as easy as it used to be.
[138:39.32]I don't want the afterlife to be like this.
[138:42.88]Every time people think of the afterlife, oh, heaven.
[138:44.88]Oh, my God.
[138:45.66]I'm moving on.
[138:46.62]They're floating as a specter.
[138:49.07]Oh, wow.
[138:51.47]Look at it.
[138:51.95]So Elizabeth's mist everywhere.
[138:53.37]Everything's misty and you're floating.
[138:55.33]No, I don't want it to be like this.
[139:07.96]Eternity's a long time.
[139:08.92]I'd get sick of that.
[139:15.41]Don't worry, you're not going to heaven.
[139:26.46]I don't have to worry about it, so I'll be alright.
[139:37.37]How do I get up here?
[140:06.00]How do I get up here?
[140:12.60]It's all dogs go to heaven, not Jeremy's.
[140:24.71]all about it's all about perspective okay like close your eyes this oh heaven this is heaven I would freak out after 20 minutes if I was just floating around just hearing this song
[140:53.64]And if I, you know, if I opened my eyes and it was like, oh, there's like grandpa and like my great, great, great grandfather, my great, great, wow.
[141:01.58]We all floated around.
[141:02.62]I'd be like, well, this sucks.
[141:03.84]What can we do?
[141:05.10]Can we do anything else with this?
[141:15.77]I don't like afterlife thoughts.
[141:17.51]That's weird to me because I don't know.
[141:19.08]We all know what this is like.
[141:21.74]So changing our plane of existence in reality drastically is too much.
[141:27.28]We know too much.
[141:28.76]We've experienced too many things.
[141:33.11]Just play the game.
[141:33.99]I'm stalling because I can't go up the stairs, man.
[141:55.73]just walk oh I did that like five times
[142:18.88]Oh, I can't wait to hang out with my great-great-great-grandfather.
[142:22.34]The guy that ran the cigarette factory.
[142:24.52]I don't want to hang out with that guy.
[142:44.00]I don't want to meet the caveman ancestor.
[142:47.84]They're all going to be there.
[142:50.95]I think we all think of like, oh, Grandma and Grandpa.
[142:55.59]And Uga and Uga is going to be there.
[143:03.75]It's going to be everyone.
[143:04.69]It's going to be too many people.
[143:05.63]There's going to be like a trillion people up there.
[143:09.56]That would be fucked up.
[143:12.10]Everybody's caveman ancestors walking around.
[143:15.58]every human that you've ever come from, ever, your group is going to be the most annoying family reunion ever.
[143:26.72]Going around and shaking every one of their hands of like the 500 fucking people.
[143:31.69]You know, when you go to an event and you're like, well, I can't wait to have the same conversation with this person and this person and this person and say goodbye a thousand times.
[143:39.69]That's what's going to happen.
[143:40.87]Except it's where you're going to go.
[143:52.95]Yeah, and what if Uga's a piece of shit?
[143:54.79]What if he's a dick?
[143:55.85]I don't want to hang out with him.
[143:56.64]I don't want to spend time with Uga.
[144:09.42]No, I don't want to go to hell either, because guess what?
[144:12.41]You know there's going to be somebody there that's going to be like, Yeah!
[144:15.25]Yeah, it's fire!
[144:16.31]Yeah!
[144:17.52]everything man I'm glad to be down here it's like I'm gonna I don't want to be with the one like distant great great great uncle that went to hell and hang out with him every day oh that's gonna be fun oh me like drunk great great great great uncle Frank and some random caveman that bashed in 50 people's skulls are the only ones that are gonna be down here that would be a disaster be horrible
[144:45.62]No.
[144:45.74]Dark Ooga.
[144:45.96]Dark Ooga.
[145:14.91]They both kind of suck.
[145:15.89]I don't want to be on my best behavior in heaven every day.
[145:30.95]You know, if like grandma's around, like I have to, I have to, I got to hang out with grandma all the time and I got to, I'm not going to be like, oh, fuck you, fuck this and fuck you.
[145:40.44]No, I'm going to be, I'm going to have to mute it down a little.
[145:43.00]You don't talk to your grandparents like that.
[145:46.12]I don't want to do that.
[145:48.84]But great, great, great drunk Uncle Frank and Dark Ooga are going to be doing coke every day.
[145:54.68]I don't want to do coke every day.
[145:55.80]I don't want to do coke.
[146:08.07]Did I pick the wrong one?
[146:08.99]What did I just do?
[146:09.89]Oh.
[146:18.79]just water down the sugar oh yeah yeah yeah alright so what am I doing here no okay I'm going down this one
[146:35.29]And also, I know people have made this reference before too, but I don't want to answer to my great-great-great-grandfather, some great man that created the first steel mill in America or whatever it is.
[146:46.28]I have to answer to this person?
[146:51.86]He probably thinks I'm an idiot.
[146:53.06]He probably thinks I'm an asshole.
[146:54.26]He probably thinks I'm stupid.
[146:56.16]I'm the caveman to my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
[147:04.52]He will think I am insane.
[147:14.13]Wait.
[147:16.75]Can I, like, fall through here?
[147:28.24]Oh, shit.
[147:33.72]Okay, this one's safe.
[147:39.61]Is this one safe too?
[147:41.75]I think.
[147:53.88]You could tell him he made half a million dollars selling ass baseballs and he'd be impressed.
[147:57.18]No, he wouldn't.
[148:00.79]He'd be like, what have you done?
[148:01.61]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[148:03.87]Stay here.
[148:04.21]What have you done?
[148:04.79]It's like, I don't want to talk about putting baseballs up my ass.
[148:08.93]Like,
[148:18.56]No, no, no.
[148:19.74]Oh, what an idiot.
[148:22.00]I'm sorry.
[148:24.11]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[148:25.75]That can't be.
[148:30.65]Dude, I was right there.
[148:31.55]I'm sorry.
[148:32.31]I know.
[148:32.63]I'm just talking.
[148:42.63]It's more important to focus on what you enjoy in life.
[148:45.05]Yeah.
[148:48.55]Okay, you know the cafeteria sounds?
[148:53.49]You know, with just loud, indistinct chatter?
[149:00.21]That's what it's going to be like.
[149:01.65]Except times a hundred trillion.
[149:04.93]Where are we all going to be?
[149:08.30]Is there a hotel room?
[149:09.88]Is there accommodations?
[149:11.72]Or are we all just floating around a trillion people?
[149:13.80]Like, is there a heaven hotel?
[149:17.41]Right?
[149:17.61]Like, think about it.
[149:18.57]Like, how would logistically that work?
[149:25.59]Heaven is infinite.
[149:28.98]But what do you mean?
[149:41.63]I didn't sign up for an existential crisis tonight.
[149:44.06]Well, look at the game we're playing.
[149:46.80]It's a pretty good topic for what we're doing.
[149:48.66]Hmm.
[150:08.01]Oh.
[150:09.31]Okay.
[150:10.97]Cheese wheel?
[150:12.71]Oh, right.
[150:13.89]Okay.
[150:14.19]Thank you.
[150:15.81]Thank you.
[150:23.95]There's no concept of time in heaven.
[150:28.62]I know, but it's... I don't... I like worldly stuff.
[150:33.16]You know what I mean?
[150:33.70]I don't want to be like a floating specter.
[150:38.46]I want to be able to watch Rick and Morty, okay?
[151:04.35]And it's like, oh, but will it be one with the cosmos?
[151:07.72]Okay, cool, but do I get to pull some levers and do some cool shit with planets?
[151:10.58]Can I make a planet or something?
[151:11.62]Like, do I get to do anything like that?
[151:14.62]It's gonna be really hard to replace Rick and Morty.
[151:16.68]I mean, it's gotta be good.
[151:19.17]I mean, like, crafting planets and being a part of, like, the cosmos.
[151:22.11]I mean, is that as good as... Will it even compare to Rick and Morty?
[151:32.94]You will be Rick and Morty.
[151:36.96]Okay, I can't look at this.
[151:37.82]I'm going to look over here.
[151:45.09]What did you say?
[151:45.55]This is Mormonism?
[151:47.85]Is it?
[151:48.07]Wait, what do you mean?
[151:52.38]Wait, what do you mean?
[151:52.92]What do you mean?
[151:53.32]What are you talking about?
[152:02.80]Wait, Mormons?
[152:04.78]Mormons, you create planets?
[152:22.90]Making planets?
[152:26.26]You become a god and make a planet.
[152:49.66]You get your own planet that you are the god of when you die.
[152:52.54]You and your first wife get a planet.
[152:57.94]That sounds fucking awesome.
[153:04.80]That's sick.
[153:06.86]That's fucking sick.
[153:10.24]Wait, I just said a bad word.
[153:11.32]Is that bad?
[153:11.94]I don't think I can do it anymore.
[153:14.08]Oh, well, I was a Mormon for five seconds.
[153:18.03]My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and by now you may have realized that all of this has happened exactly the way it was supposed to.
[153:27.11]You see, everyone who comes to the Institute does so because they feel that they are no longer in control of something important to them.
[153:38.94]Now you don't get a planet.
[153:42.58]Minus one planet.
[153:44.42]But more often than not, the problem is not that the problems we face can't be solved.
[153:50.63]The problem is that we become so afraid of failure that we refuse to see our problems from a new perspective.
[153:58.77]And so we do the same things again and again and again.
[154:04.47]And therein, of course, we find exactly the failure we were looking for.
[154:27.92]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[154:29.52]Whatever.
[154:38.22]It doesn't work like that.
[154:39.32]Somebody said, hey dude, you can have my planet.
[154:42.55]Like, when I'm gone.
[154:44.29]You can't just gift a planet.
[154:45.99]That's not how it works.
[154:47.17]You can't just give me your planet because you went through all the... You were a faithful person.
[154:52.31]That's not how it works.
[154:55.11]Even though it meant facing obstacles that seemed impossible at first, you thought outside the box and you overcame them.
[155:03.36]Because you saw things from every angle, you understood what they really were.
[155:09.63]Because you kept moving forward, no matter how far off the path you were told you were headed or how unexpected it became, you found your way.
[155:20.00]A lot of chess themes.
[155:29.88]We persevered.
[155:31.84]We took different ways.
[155:33.08]We made our own path.
[155:38.02]And here's a planet.
[155:42.78]Just for you.
[155:47.94]In a few minutes, you'll be back in the real world.
[155:50.88]And some part of you will say that none of this was real.
[155:54.84]So how could it have really meant anything?
[155:58.62]But just like the power of perspective itself, it will have been as real as you believed it to be.
[156:07.23]All you've got to do is wake up.
[156:11.73]That was a good game.
[156:25.95]That was really good.
[156:27.35]That was a nice few hour experience.
[156:29.31]That was cool.
[156:31.23]I very much enjoyed that.
[156:32.17]That was good.
[156:46.32]Go back to Mythbusters.
[156:47.38]I'm not going to do that.
[156:49.56]That game was cute.
[156:50.12]Nothing wrong with it.
[156:51.48]Nothing wrong with it.
[156:57.22]I like this song.
[157:08.07]Long stream?
[157:09.12]Um, not long at all, actually.
[157:20.79]Uh, this started at 7 p.m.
[157:22.69]This is a late night stream, so I didn't go long.
[157:25.74]Pretty normal length, five hours or so.
[157:30.02]That was cool.
[157:32.07]So here's the plan for this week.
[157:34.27]I'm not going to stream tomorrow, but I'll be live the next day.
[157:37.26]I'll be live on, well, tomorrow.
[157:41.46]Okay, so technically we're talking about Thursday is when I'm streaming.
[157:45.58]So I'm not streaming today, Wednesday, technically.
[157:48.00]I'm streaming on Thursday.
[157:48.78]I'm going to play Multiversus.
[157:51.20]I think it's going to be sponsored.
[157:54.06]I'm going to be playing a lot of Gizmo.
[157:57.80]I'm actually looking really forward to it.
[158:01.95]Morty came out too.
[158:02.89]I didn't play it, but you bet your ass I want to play it when Gizmo's out.
[158:09.23]That is not the only thing we're going to do.
[158:12.31]We will do something else as well.
[158:15.71]From Gremlins, yeah.
[158:17.76]Gizmo from Gremlins is going to be in multiverses.
[158:21.72]Whenever they put it in.
[158:36.77]How come you don't have a graphic tee of Gremlins 2?
[158:38.67]They don't even make them.
[158:40.88]Do they?
[158:41.16]I mean, I don't know.
[158:45.60]Yeah, we'll play multiverses and we'll do something else.
[158:47.26]Maybe, I don't know.
[158:50.30]I would say sorcery, but I kind of want that to be its own thing.
[158:55.81]We'll start with something else.
[158:58.31]We'll move to multiverses.
[159:01.12]So for those of you that don't, uh, not into multiverses, that's fine.
[159:05.93]We'll start with something else.
[159:06.87]We'll move on to multiverses.
[159:07.83]Although I, I mean, obviously it's a sponsored stream, so you, uh, you know, come, come hang out.
[159:17.09]Splatoon, but we'll do something for a little bit for.
[159:28.07]Yeah, I have no idea if Gizmo is coming out or not.
[159:31.57]I know that he's supposed to soon.
[159:33.75]Yeah, they already announced it.
[159:45.18]They announced Gizmo.
[159:45.74]What about Disney Infinity?
[159:53.10]Is it September 8th?
[159:54.63]I hope so.
[159:59.41]I'm under the impression that it was happening soon.
[160:03.60]Make a tier list?
[160:04.42]I'm not going to read that.
[160:07.28]Stream sooner?
[160:07.92]This is not a normal stream time for me.
[160:10.86]This is completely out of the ordinary.
[160:12.10]I just had stuff going on this afternoon.
[160:17.31]You can expect most streams to start somewhere around 3 or 4 Pacific.
[160:20.97]Which is exactly, precisely when we will start playing on Thursday.
[160:25.61]Okay.
[160:27.09]We'll start around 4 o'clock.
[160:29.38]We'll move to multiverse is probably around... Maybe around 6 or 7, maybe?
[160:35.98]Play that for a few hours?
[160:39.88]He was supposed to be out today.
[160:41.06]Okay, well then that makes sense.
[160:50.37]4 is too late.
[160:51.25]Not for me.
[160:53.85]Not for me.
[160:56.61]Alright, that's it guys.
[160:57.43]I'll see you later.
[160:57.91]I'll see you on Thursday.
[161:02.11]I'm glad to kind of be back to normal now.
[161:05.21]Just kind of hanging out.
[161:07.33]Although Name Your Price was a ton of fun and Hey Donna was too if you didn't see that.
[161:11.03]That was a blast.
[161:12.11]I had a ton of fun on those streams.
[161:14.65]That was a lot of fun.
[161:18.21]Austin is awesome.
[161:20.43]It's actually the first time I've really spent any significant time with Austin.
[161:27.26]And Will, too, for that matter.
[161:29.84]I hung out with them.
[161:30.81]I talked to them briefly at the Streamer Awards.
[161:34.57]And we said, oh, yeah, we'll do something together sometime.
[161:38.35]Cool, yeah, yeah.
[161:39.27]And it's like, oh, let's do this.
[161:40.85]They have that show.
[161:41.67]We got Hey Donna.
[161:42.53]We got Name Your Price.
[161:43.69]And I'm like, fucking let's go.
[161:48.48]You had sensational drip.
[161:49.80]Yeah.
[161:54.52]Yeah, they're awesome.
[161:56.42]It was really cool to participate in their shows.
[161:58.24]I thought they were really well made.
[162:00.06]They were really well done.
[162:01.53]So, it was a good experience.
[162:06.07]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[162:06.99]Take care of yourselves.
[162:08.79]Goodbye.
[162:09.43]Goodnight.
[162:10.31]Call your mother.
[162:10.71]You know the deal.
[162:22.58]Oh, also, when I jumped up on the chair...
[162:25.55]And it freaked everybody out.
[162:27.37]I saw somebody commented.
[162:28.69]I saw a comment saying, guys, maybe he can dodge a battle axe.
[162:34.71]So now you believe me.
[162:40.19]I'm glad I'm convincing you more and more every day.
[162:51.15]I saw that comment.
[162:52.07]I saw it had some upvotes.
[162:53.29]I was like, yes, yes, you get it.
[163:01.57]Glad you didn't eat shit.
[163:04.73]No, I wouldn't.
[163:07.51]I wouldn't.
[163:08.29]I might have some pain issues in my kind of upper chest and back, but I can still move.
[163:14.64]I can still move, Buster.
[163:34.65]That was a weird laugh.
[163:35.41]I'm sorry.
[163:35.87]And usually there's music to mask how weird that would sound, but not right now.
[163:39.63]That was like... Dude, I'll give you my planet.
[163:48.12]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[163:49.26]Take care of yourselves.
[163:51.23]Good night.
[163:51.57]Goodbye.
[164:39.78]you
[165:14.64]you
[165:48.31]Thank you.
