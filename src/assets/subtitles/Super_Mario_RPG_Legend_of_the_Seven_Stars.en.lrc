[00:01.23]What is going on in this chatroom?
[00:05.97]This is just... It's just a bunch of words.
[00:11.82]Just nonsense words.
[00:13.16]Wait, what do you mean Nightbot?
[00:22.17]Nightbot isn't modded?
[00:24.37]What?
[00:26.39]How?
[00:28.81]That makes no sense!
[00:29.67]What?
[00:32.45]Where is Nightbot?
[00:33.63]Where is he?
[00:37.87]So, there's this... Nightbot.
[00:40.10]Wait, I can't even see.
[00:41.56]Not... I gotta... Nightbot isn't... Why is Nightbot not modded?
[00:46.46]What the fuck?
[00:51.28]Alright, now it's... Now you... All the fun is over.
[00:54.82]Now I understand.
[00:56.00]Okay, I see.
[01:07.17]You've been purged.
[01:11.77]Yeah, Nightbot is my security guard who's sleeping at his desk.
[01:18.94]I just had to go and like shake his desk for a second.
[01:21.84]Okay, I just shook my desk and all my fucking monitors are screwed up.
[01:26.90]Hold on.
[01:28.34]What the fuck just happened?
[01:29.37]I just shook my desk and my desktop on my computer flickered.
[01:33.94]And all my icons have moved, and my... Hold on, I think my display thing pulled out.
[01:39.36]Yep.
[01:39.96]Okay.
[01:40.37]I don't know what to do about this.
[01:41.51]Yeah, okay.
[01:42.11]Well, it doesn't matter.
[01:42.65]Uh, I have three monitors, and the middle monitor's DVI cable just got unplugged.
[01:49.67]It's okay, because we don't need it.
[01:52.17]What do we need that for?
[01:52.91]You understand?
[01:55.85]You know what we're doing tonight, right?
[01:59.63]By popular demand, and I do mean popular...
[02:03.53]We're going to play my favorite video game of all time.
[02:10.84]Ever.
[02:14.14]I have a top five.
[02:18.62]It's up there.
[02:19.78]It's probably number one or two or three.
[02:23.38]I don't know.
[02:23.68]It's definitely in the... I would say, you know, it's not fair.
[02:28.27]To have a top five video games you've ever played in your whole life, they're all number one.
[02:33.43]You don't get to choose in that point, I don't think.
[02:39.17]We're going to play... Super Mario RPG.
[02:43.77]Legend of the Seven Stars.
[02:44.85]Now, when you ask me, why are we doing that?
[02:48.41]Because, a few weeks ago, we talked about our favorite games, and would you ever stream some of your old favorites?
[02:53.46]Or have, like, a nostalgia, relaxing kind of stream night?
[02:56.56]And I'm like, I don't know, I've played them a lot.
[02:58.94]Probably not.
[02:59.98]But then I just said, fuck it.
[03:02.84]Sure.
[03:03.74]Why not?
[03:05.30]So we're going to play Mario RPG.
[03:13.09]That's the plan?
[03:15.59]Didn't you say Chrono Trigger was your favorite?
[03:17.09]They're all my favorites.
[03:18.65]There's five or six of them.
[03:24.03]I have beaten this game many times, although I don't remember everything every time, right?
[03:30.33]Small details get lost.
[03:31.75]Even some of the large details do as well.
[03:33.98]But I do end up playing through this game like once every three to four years.
[03:44.60]It's a great one.
[03:45.30]If you've never seen this game, if you've never played it, then you're in for a treat.
[03:50.55]In fact, if you've never played this game before, just go get it.
[03:55.29]and delete me from right now.
[03:57.22]There's no- just enjoy it.
[03:58.68]It's a fucking fanta- or experience it with all of us, if you want to.
[04:08.24]And, why don't we switch over to it right now.
[04:14.37]This, by the way, has some of the best music ever from any video game.
[04:20.15]Uh, Yoko Shimomura, I believe, uh, is the composer.
[04:29.13]And I am a purist when it comes to this kind of things.
[04:33.72]This is Mario.
[04:35.48]This is not Jeremy.
[04:36.60]This is not Jex.
[04:38.22]This is Super Mario.
[04:43.32]I'm not going to name... All the characters have to be their actual names.
[04:51.65]I can't do it.
[04:53.43]Because every conversation that comes up throughout the course of this entire game
[05:00.53]It's Mario, Mario, Mario.
[05:02.13]Hey, Mario, Mario.
[05:03.61]I don't want to be called Pee Pants.
[05:05.71]Hey, Pee Pants!
[05:07.47]Hey, Larry!
[05:09.35]No, this is Mario.
[05:11.76]If there was character customization, sure.
[05:16.18]If I could change Mario's hat and pants color and take his mustache off and make his nose bigger, okay, then that's not Mario.
[05:23.44]But it is.
[05:23.72]I'm gonna do it just like it shows up on TV.
[05:31.06]No, I'm not gonna do Jario.
[05:33.66]I can't do that.
[05:34.64]This is, that's Mario right there.
[05:40.86]What do you mean boring?
[05:41.90]No, it's... You're ruining my childhood!
[05:46.89]Settle down!
[05:48.03]This is Super Mario!
[05:55.23]No, I'm supposed to be relaxing.
[06:23.57]You know what's funny about this?
[06:28.01]Everybody, when they were younger, just made this their name.
[06:36.15]And it's not correct.
[06:40.90]You would go to Blockbuster and rent this shit, and there would be a few save files from people that got, I don't know, a tenth of the way through the game, and it was like, Steve, Matt, Andrew,
[06:54.01]Catherine.
[06:54.61]Nobody ever did Mario.
[06:57.26]And that's who that is.
[07:24.47]No, I can't do that.
[07:25.53]I'm a purist.
[07:30.21]It's gonna be Mario.
[07:30.99]Come on, let's go.
[07:45.56]Who the fuck is Ralph?
[07:49.26]Ah, shit.
[07:49.54]That's right.
[07:50.32]I rented this from Blockbuster.
[07:51.48]That's right.
[08:05.30]Sometimes I forget where I got it.
[08:10.64]This is Zach.
[08:15.50]Calm the fuck down.
[08:16.48]This is not like an exciting game.
[08:17.94]It is.
[08:18.24]Alright, quiet.
[08:42.28]The game starts off like any other Mario game.
[08:49.77]You've got Bowser.
[08:50.97]You've got the princess.
[08:52.65]You've got the castle.
[08:55.70]And you've got Mario.
[09:02.24]We get in there.
[09:02.90]Ah, I remember this.
[09:06.81]Yep.
[09:07.99]Wow.
[09:12.24]So you can jump.
[09:13.24]You can run.
[09:17.66]That's pretty much what you do in every Mario game that you've ever played.
[09:23.07]You can jump.
[09:23.57]No, you can't.
[09:24.43]See, I'm one of these... This is my favorite kind of RPG.
[09:28.29]Oh, Jerma, how come you don't like most RPGs turn-based?
[09:30.53]Because... I don't like having to randomly fight enemies.
[09:34.62]Chrono Trigger did this same shit.
[09:37.17]You don't have to fight people.
[09:38.79]You can just run around them.
[09:39.73]There's no random battles.
[09:41.03]I hate random battles.
[09:42.59]I want to see them on the screen.
[09:46.91]Anyways, you got a B, an A, an X, and a Y, like the Super Nintendo controller.
[09:51.34]Y, by the way, is your special moves.
[09:52.92]B is defense and running away.
[09:55.02]X is items, and A is attack.
[09:58.26]Now, this game implemented one of the... I made this video.
[10:07.22]I've already made this video!
[10:11.21]I'm getting nostalgia not on the game, but on the video that I made like six years ago.
[10:17.27]Yes, there are timed hits, and there are timed defenses as well, and usually I'm pretty good at this, but you know, it's been a few years.
[10:25.62]No, I didn't get it.
[10:26.40]It's right after he lands, so it's like dun-dun-dun, A. A is the timed hit.
[10:35.73]Hey, it's time to hit when you block and when you are attacking.
[10:40.30]Although I'm not getting experience right now, that's why I don't want to really do much of this, so I just want to get through it.
[10:45.54]Because this is the tutorial, essentially.
[10:49.06]Is this a walkthrough?
[10:50.00]Yes.
[10:52.44]No, it's not.
[10:57.02]By the way, some fun trivia for you.
[10:58.66]This is the first isometric 3D-esque game that Nintendo decided to release.
[11:05.54]This game did not do that well because it was released at the very end of the Super Nintendo's life cycle.
[11:11.50]Which, as you know, most of the other consoles were already being released by then.
[11:17.37]It is a cult classic status at this point.
[11:21.69]And because it sucks.
[11:22.65]I'm not kidding, actually banned that person.
[11:25.39]For at least 10 minutes.
[11:28.11]Like, I mean, that's a 10 minute timeout.
[11:29.97]Like, how dare you.
[11:31.95]That's a block.
[11:32.91]Every time I grab my head, that means that I did it.
[11:38.37]You wanna see what a non-timed hit looks like?
[11:54.59]See, you can take zero damage in this game.
[11:56.43]Mario, the chain!
[11:58.13]Aim for the chain!
[11:59.69]See, if this is your first time playing, you'd be like, wait, what?
[12:02.54]Oh, what the fuck?
[12:03.74]I can aim for the chain!
[12:05.62]And you'd go, what?
[12:06.88]No, my brain is pro- Hit the chain, drop Bowser?
[12:10.42]Sounds like a plan.
[12:13.40]15 damage.
[12:13.70]You guys wanna see what a non-timed hit looks like?
[12:22.24]Because Toads are going to come out and explain all this.
[12:24.77]I'm giving you spoilers.
[12:26.13]I don't want to be the person that says, we're going to watch the movie and then I'm going to tell you everything that happens in the movie.
[12:30.47]Toads end this game.
[12:31.27]That's all you need to know.
[12:35.59]Mario, the chain.
[12:36.69]I am in for the chain.
[12:38.05]That's what I'm doing.
[12:41.95]Boom.
[12:44.33]What was that sound?
[12:48.23]No!
[12:49.93]It's a chain reaction.
[12:52.18]Hang on, Pink Link.
[13:01.59]Coming, Mario?
[13:06.75]Fight, Mario, fight!
[13:08.41]Fight!
[13:10.44]This should finish you.
[13:16.42]I can't do it.
[13:17.12]I was going to do the... You know what I'm talking about, the... You know what I mean.
[13:24.45]Did you think I was just going to give her to you?
[13:27.47]You're always in my way.
[13:29.37]This is it.
[13:30.73]I'm going to take you out, Mario.
[13:35.20]Foiled again.
[13:35.92]Shit.
[13:45.08]Oh, Mario.
[13:46.40]You had me so worried.
[13:48.28]Let's get out of here.
[13:52.52]I'm going to fall.
[13:56.45]Now, what the heck's happening here?
[13:57.53]You're probably saying, wait, well, this is not, this is, Mario beats Bowser, Princess Peach, they all go back and they, and that's it, but who the fuck is this guy?
[14:09.27]That's somebody I've never seen before.
[14:10.61]Ooh, and he went right into the castle, didn't he?
[14:19.92]Super Mario RPG.
[14:26.43]You're feeling sleepy.
[14:28.33]Very sleepy.
[14:31.44]And there go the stars.
[14:32.64]They were broken from the sword.
[14:34.98]And here's the overworld map.
[14:36.16]We get launched over here.
[14:36.86]What happened here?
[14:40.02]The sword went right into Mario's head.
[14:42.15]Don't narrate this anymore.
[14:47.83]I'm sorry.
[14:54.67]know I really am making the sword drops down and uh what happens here we got a problem I'm like the audiobook alright alright I'm good hey Mario lots of people use something called a door to go in and out of their houses anyway I came by to pick up toad school since she's a bit late
[15:21.98]Quiet, Archer.
[15:22.58]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[15:23.96]Thank you.
[15:24.24]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[15:28.16]You can jump on the bed.
[15:30.85]Let's go turn the light on.
[15:32.49]Watch this.
[15:33.17]Ready?
[15:35.89]Good night.
[15:41.44]Ah.
[15:42.16]Alright.
[15:42.64]What else can we do here?
[15:43.30]Lots of stuff.
[15:44.36]Here we go.
[15:49.23]First save point of the game.
[15:51.39]The save point's scattered around.
[15:55.81]Fuck you, Ralph.
[15:57.49]Oh no, Ralph's save!
[16:09.68]Actually, I feel bad about Ralph's save.
[16:15.80]Ralph's not even, I don't think, a real person.
[16:20.65]Hey, I thought the princess was here with you, Mario.
[16:22.77]Where is she?
[16:23.45]I hate this.
[16:25.20]Nobody can do Toad unless you do that.
[16:29.40]Toad is just Marge, but a little higher pitched.
[16:33.34]Mario, what's with the silent treatment?
[16:35.22]No, I'm not going to do that.
[16:36.68]You're not telling me something.
[16:39.30]It's Bowser again, isn't it?
[16:41.14]Oh no, here we go again.
[16:43.07]Mario, would you please bring her back like you always do?
[16:50.88]That's worse.
[16:53.55]It's not worse.
[16:54.17]It's better.
[16:55.01]Let's go up to Bowser's Keep.
[16:57.49]To Mike Tyson.
[17:02.85]Halt.
[17:09.12]Who goes there?
[17:09.84]A trespasser.
[17:12.48]This castle now belongs to us.
[17:15.14]The Smithy Gang.
[17:17.31]It's our first step towards taking over this world.
[17:20.87]And if it weren't for nosy characters like you, we'd practically own this world.
[17:27.86]So let's see you deal with this!
[17:30.18]I can't make it.
[17:50.12]He took out the bridge.
[17:50.86]So we, I mean, what do we do now?
[17:52.29]Why does this guy sound exactly like a Jerma character?
[17:54.73]Because I'm sitting here doing that.
[18:17.75]Alright, let's go.
[18:18.57]I'm excited.
[18:19.36]I love this game.
[18:21.36]Alright, Jay Leno, Mike Tyson, or Toad.
[18:25.38]Which one do you want me to do?
[18:26.92]Pick one.
[18:28.62]I'm seeing a lot of Leno.
[18:34.16]Okay.
[18:36.08]You're back so soon.
[18:37.16]Did you forget something?
[18:38.64]No?
[18:39.46]What happened out there?
[18:41.60]Oof.
[18:47.61]The bridge to Bowser's Keep is out now?
[18:49.93]Just wonderful.
[18:51.57]We gotta inform the Chancellor of Mushroom Kingdom at once.
[18:54.59]Let's go, Mario.
[18:55.33]We're gonna inform the Chancellor of what's going on.
[19:03.44]Come on, here we go.
[19:09.32]Oh, excuse me.
[19:10.72]Oh, that bump on your head reduced your HP level.
[19:14.00]One of Mushroom Kingdom's famous items at a peak.
[19:19.96]Received a mushroom.
[19:21.32]Do you know how to use items?
[19:23.28]Of course I do, Toad.
[19:25.35]Oh, I see.
[19:25.95]You're just so well-traveled and experienced, Mario.
[19:31.31]Now, why did I rush back?
[19:32.71]I had something to tell you.
[19:38.30]Oh, I remember.
[19:39.10]I came to warn you the mushroom was swarming with monsters.
[19:43.36]I just barely made it back here in one piece.
[19:46.48]This is Meowth.
[19:47.14]You're right.
[19:49.30]Mario, please do something.
[19:51.23]Perhaps I can help.
[19:51.97]Do you know about timed hits?
[19:54.99]Yeah.
[19:56.87]Hey, you better watch out.
[19:57.69]He knows about timed hits.
[19:58.93]He's going to punch your lights out.
[20:03.79]He's got more bark than bite, huh?
[20:07.65]Why did I rush back?
[20:08.41]I had something to tell you.
[20:11.53]Oh, that's right.
[20:12.03]We need to tell the Chancellor about Toadstool.
[20:14.51]I'll see you over at Mushroom Kingdom.
[20:16.55]Have you seen this?
[20:17.01]Have you heard about it?
[20:18.46]Just in case, take these with you.
[20:20.68]Three mushrooms.
[20:22.52]The Chancellor.
[20:34.53]I'm so glad Jerma isn't an actor.
[20:37.93]You don't... You don't... Give me a... What?
[20:41.91]I've played this game 500 times.
[20:44.35]I'm just having some fun with the voices, alright?
[20:46.27]You want me to really give you acting?
[20:47.66]Fine.
[20:57.98]On the next dialogue, you'll see what a real actor looks like.
[21:00.08]But first of all, we want to do this because this is the best song in the game!
[21:08.31]The battle music is the best.
[21:14.17]The mushrooms heal you, as you've probably become aware.
[21:20.85]I blocked that, it was 2 damage, what?
[21:25.93]You get random events like that?
[21:27.71]HP max, that's good.
[21:31.15]The boss music is very good as well.
[21:38.19]Yeah, this is also back when Mario punched hard with both hands.
[21:43.29]Now he kicks and flips, right?
[21:45.78]This experience, I don't really need this right now, but let's go ahead and get the coins, because the coins are currency.
[21:50.74]You use these to buy stuff at the shops, and upgrade weapons, and let's, you know, let's save Toad.
[22:12.85]Yeah.
[22:14.43]Toad gives you useful stuff as you go through here.
[22:18.75]Two EXP.
[22:19.75]Now I have to figure out how I want to do this.
[22:22.38]Alright.
[22:24.98]My life was flashing before my eyes for a second there.
[22:27.84]Here's a little something.
[22:28.70]Just thanks.
[22:29.16]I appreciate it.
[22:45.12]This is fine, because the XP is good.
[22:46.98]You level up.
[22:48.52]That's not a toad voice.
[22:49.78]Don't worry, I'm just getting one done.
[23:00.61]Now there are hidden blocks in the game, as you probably could have guessed.
[23:10.56]What are my first impressions of the game?
[23:11.84]Um, I don't know.
[23:13.40]Not that good.
[23:13.92]I mean, it's like, what is... I don't understand.
[23:16.02]It's an RPG?
[23:16.84]Like, turn-based?
[23:18.64]I fight two... This is not even hard.
[23:20.18]I fight two things at once.
[23:22.16]That's it?
[23:24.16]Um, like, okay.
[23:25.10]That's not hard.
[23:25.85]I only like hard games.
[23:28.37]No, I'm sorry.
[23:28.97]I don't like this.
[23:29.43]I only like hard games.
[23:39.33]Let's save Toad.
[23:43.31]Somebody says, me too, I only like hard games too.
[23:53.77]The game actually does get... The game does get a little challenging, just in regards to some facets of the game.
[24:03.62]Faucets of the game.
[24:04.28]How do you say that?
[24:07.01]Boy, that was a close call.
[24:08.37]Here's a token of my appreciation.
[24:10.85]Flower tab.
[24:12.52]So if you want to know what a flower tab does, this is the interesting part.
[24:16.60]Flower is mana.
[24:19.60]So, when you have, you can get flower tabs, flower boxes, flower jars, and they increase your maximum mana by one.
[24:31.77]Pretty neat, huh?
[24:32.45]That's pretty cool.
[24:33.55]Syrup is a mana potion.
[24:35.68]Think of mushrooms as health potions.
[24:37.32]And that's cool.
[24:43.48]It's fun.
[24:44.38]Check for secrets.
[24:45.08]You know, there could be secrets anywhere.
[24:48.50]The one thing that I never, ever actually did in this game, and never really explored, even though I've played this game a thousand times...
[24:57.45]...is the Frog Coins.
[24:59.97]I never did anything with them, and I never cared to.
[25:01.99]Alright, there is a... Toad is, I think, being beaten up.
[25:12.82]Oops.
[25:13.34]They're mostly useless.
[25:14.26]Oh shit, I shouldn't have Red Shattered.
[25:15.24]It just took a lot of damage.
[25:16.78]Uh, yeah, that's my understanding from that as well.
[25:19.24]Because Frog Coins are just very novelty things.
[25:22.27]Weird accessories that you can get.
[25:38.22]There is a permanently missable frog coin where you have to jump off a toad's head who starts walking during a cutscene.
[25:43.84]Really?
[25:44.87]See, that's the kind of shit I love.
[25:58.10]That's coming up really soon, actually.
[26:01.20]Is it?
[26:01.48]Uh-oh.
[26:02.24]I'm gonna miss it.
[26:04.50]I'm gonna need to heal, too.
[26:07.95]Three hour stream of Jerma fighting Kulex.
[26:10.31]No.
[26:11.13]Actually.
[26:12.61]I will beat Kulex first try.
[26:16.49]I hate to say it.
[26:17.03]I'm sorry to say it.
[26:23.09]Now, when I fight Kulex is another story.
[26:27.72]Where's Toad?
[26:28.98]I know you're over here somewhere.
[26:33.08]Where's Toad?
[26:36.28]Isn't he hidden over here?
[26:40.58]Oh, there he is.
[26:40.98]Alright.
[26:41.64]Ooh, that's scary.
[26:44.00]Uh-oh.
[26:46.52]Really gotta pad out this playthrough.
[26:48.32]This is the first mini boss in the game.
[26:55.19]Alright, gotta get a good voice.
[26:57.85]Hey, are you looking at me?
[27:00.73]My hammer and I don't like you.
[27:03.61]Mario, you better be careful.
[27:05.53]He's definitely got a mean streak.
[27:14.22]Now you got my hammer angry you shouldn't have done that And there's two the hammer brothers so we're gonna do something fun we're gonna just use jump 33 damage
[27:39.08]We're gonna use it over and over again just to get rid of this one gone.
[27:43.10]See you later.
[27:46.42]I do have to be careful because Valor up now means that they take more damage.
[27:50.98]And they dish it out too.
[27:53.22]Okay, six seconds is too much.
[28:03.19]See?
[28:03.35]Uh-oh, this is actually important.
[28:09.32]I didn't get it.
[28:09.74]Oh fuck, I'm gonna die.
[28:18.34]Die.
[28:18.60]I'm gonna die in my eleventh playthrough.
[28:22.36]Uh oh.
[28:23.38]I can just do it by hand.
[28:24.50]I don't wanna use the honey syrup.
[28:33.75]Okay, I gotta get this right.
[28:36.96]No, there it is.
[28:37.82]Okay.
[28:38.50]Some block, when you block shit, you might not get it right.
[28:43.55]They're weirdly timed.
[28:45.45]That whole animation has to go by first, before you block.
[28:48.27]Uh, I think... Yeah, I'm gonna do it again.
[29:01.31]I really want to just jump on him, but is it really worth me taking a Honey Syrup?
[29:04.05]He's probably, he's got like five health left.
[29:10.39]There it is.
[29:11.99]How did you know?
[29:12.63]I just do.
[29:19.84]Why is it that whenever I play bad games, you're here, but whenever I play good games, you're not here?
[29:25.44]Well, which one is this?
[29:30.22]I don't know which one is this.
[29:33.60]Got a flower jar, though, and we leveled up.
[29:43.50]Max HP 25, 23, 2.
[29:44.72]It's magic attack and magic defense.
[29:51.53]Level this up correctly or I'm gonna unfollow.
[29:53.67]See, when I was younger, I did a thing and I kind of just continue to do it.
[30:02.05]I pick one option and I do it every single time with each playable character.
[30:10.02]So I would just have, like, for instance, Mario would have hundreds of HP.
[30:19.13]And I don't, I never really changed that up.
[30:25.74]Because there's three people in your party, so I figured, alright, one of them's gonna be good at everything.
[30:32.96]I want health.
[30:34.02]I do.
[30:37.67]Actually, maybe... I gotta think about this.
[30:42.03]I'm gonna do health.
[30:46.14]Power, power.
[30:46.78]No, I'm gonna do health.
[30:48.18]Caring about HP.
[30:49.54]Yeah, you have to care about HP in this game.
[30:51.08]Otherwise, people die.
[30:53.44]You'll die.
[30:56.18]Let us pick.
[30:57.55]I'm gonna let you guys ruin my childhood again.
[31:03.03]Fine.
[31:05.33]I'll let you guys ruin my childhood again.
[31:06.97]You guys are really on to this recently, ruining my childhood every day.
[31:14.67]And when I mean every day, I don't mean every... I mean like just today.
[31:17.33]I don't know why I said every day.
[31:18.47]Okay.
[31:21.27]Uh, sure, why not?
[31:22.15]Here we go.
[31:23.55]You guys can pick.
[31:25.25]Don't fuck this up though, because like you literally will ruin this whole game.
[31:31.67]What do you want me to do?
[31:35.43]Like, really, don't fuck this up.
[31:36.79]Okay.
[31:37.09]Alright, we're doing power.
[31:38.61]Thank you for choosing the thing I'm going to pick for Mario every time.
[31:45.37]By the way, I forgot to mention that's what this was.
[32:10.74]Why can't I get this off the screen?
[32:16.64]Get off the screen!
[32:17.48]Why can't I attack?
[32:18.18]There we go.
[32:19.48]Alright, power.
[32:20.62]Attack went up from 23 to 24, defense 2 to 3.
[32:23.10]Now this is physical attack power.
[32:25.98]So if somebody casts a magic spell, this is not going to do shit.
[32:29.80]I hope you guys understand what you've just done.
[32:32.59]Alright.
[32:37.33]Thanks, Mario!
[32:38.21]I was running so fast, I wasn't watching where I was going!
[32:41.49]Whoa, Mushroom Kingdom's just ahead.
[32:44.13]We're almost there, Mario.
[32:46.43]Hey, where'd this hammer come from?
[32:49.47]Hmm.
[32:50.81]Hey, do you know what this is?
[32:55.57]It's the Hammer Brothers insignia.
[32:58.75]No one stands a chance against you when you warp them with this.
[33:05.51]You never know, it might come in handy.
[33:09.25]Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.
[33:12.27]Let's get a move on.
[33:13.75]I'll see you in Mushroom Kingdom.
[33:19.48]You can probably guess that that is a weapon.
[33:24.84]Attack power goes to 34.
[33:30.34]Now the game begins.
[33:38.96]Mushroom Kingdom.
[33:42.84]I thought this was for crafting?
[33:43.99]No.
[33:48.09]Here's the Mushroom Kingdom.
[33:51.35]Hey Mario, look what you're standing in!
[33:55.47]Gotcha!
[33:57.75]He made me jump.
[33:59.28]Just a fan.
[34:04.72]The star means it's an inn and a save point.
[34:07.77]And the mushroom means it's a shop and potentially... Yeah, catch a bit.
[34:13.83]Items and weapons and all that good stuff.
[34:18.72]Here we go.
[34:19.30]See?
[34:19.38]Shirt, pants, shoes.
[34:35.69]uh jumps you'll use jump attacks against any foe this is really good antidote pin prevents poison but I need you gotta get you gotta get armor first it's important get pants Mario's not wearing pants uh shirt and pants and I also did this when I played this game all the time I am going to get a lot of for this I already know it
[35:04.36]There's going to be a lot of RPG min-maxers that are going to be, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
[35:10.29]I max out my inventory with revives.
[35:13.35]Every time.
[35:15.27]I have like 20 pick-me-ups.
[35:19.35]Because I'm terrible at video games.
[35:21.59]So I just have a ton of heals and pick-me-ups.
[35:26.89]And I'm probably going to get made fun of.
[35:28.99]But I'm already accepting that.
[35:32.90]It's not optimal at all.
[35:34.89]I know.
[35:37.33]But for right now, this is fine.
[35:38.41]I don't have enough for the jump shoes.
[35:41.31]Let's equip.
[35:42.65]Somebody just gave a lot of money.
[35:46.11]Defense and magic defense.
[35:48.37]And pants, they're not for me.
[35:50.98]They're for somebody else.
[35:52.84]I wonder who.
[35:54.96]Phylactery, let's just give 100 bucks.
[36:03.85]Thank you for the $100.11.
[36:10.47]They say, I will give you $500 to play Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door on stream.
[36:16.86]Well, I'm sorry to say I will never get that money.
[36:20.76]I'm never going to receive that money.
[36:22.56]And I'm not going to do that.
[36:24.90]I appreciate it, though.
[36:25.80]Thank you so much for the $100.00.
[36:35.04]Oh, yeah, this is the person that's playing on the Game Boy.
[36:37.44]Wait, this is important stuff.
[36:41.18]But, no, File Actor lets you go to, like... You have to be up to over $500, $600, $700, $800.
[36:45.91]Thank you.
[36:47.33]Here we go, ready?
[36:48.87]Don't talk to me now!
[36:54.09]Nothing up there.
[36:58.70]He's on, like, the last level of the game or something.
[37:00.78]And all the ends...
[37:04.98]People are just sleeping.
[37:05.88]It's not like I'm always sleeping.
[37:09.06]Yes, it is.
[37:09.88]You're always sleeping.
[37:13.77]Don't talk to him.
[37:14.29]He's gaming.
[37:14.87]Paper Mario is better than this.
[37:18.83]Well, that's the thing about video game opinions.
[37:22.45]I get to have one, and so do you.
[37:25.08]And I happen to think this is the best game that Nintendo's probably ever made.
[37:30.48]And if you like it, then that's... If you like the other one better, I'm glad you do.
[37:36.75]but you're wrong.
[37:40.03]Just kidding.
[37:44.34]It's so nice to see our young ones having a good time, but you're not that old.
[37:50.58]I always look for boxes.
[37:54.52]Wrong, wrong, wrong.
[37:55.94]Oh, look, here's like the wicked, like, caffeine person.
[37:59.78]Mario, let's say you and I get hitched in a few years, okay?
[38:03.78]Just give me time to grow into my mother's wedding dress.
[38:11.45]I hope my grandchild turns out to be just like the princess.
[38:17.03]Alright, let's go.
[38:21.15]Hey, did you see a crocodile around here?
[38:23.46]He talks like a mobster wannabe.
[38:25.64]I'm sure he's up to no good.
[38:27.54]Hey, wait a second.
[38:28.14]My wallet's gone.
[38:31.50]Oh, shit.
[38:32.08]I'm sorry about your wallet.
[38:34.70]Alright, let's continue.
[38:35.52]I think there's... Anything else to see in here?
[38:41.76]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[38:43.24]This kid.
[38:45.28]One, two, three.
[38:46.77]Think if I practice enough, I'll jump as high as you, Mario?
[38:50.97]You're right, kid.
[38:52.73]Thanks a bunch.
[39:02.68]Think if I practice?
[39:04.68]Absolutely.
[39:06.68]Yes!
[39:07.24]I love that.
[39:11.84]There's the sprite going up and down.
[39:14.36]Look, I'll help you!
[39:21.16]In fact, you might be better than me, kid.
[39:23.84]Keep at it.
[39:24.22]Alright, let's go talk to the Chancellor.
[39:35.54]Do all toads, like, talk like Toad?
[39:38.85]Or is there some toads that talk like this?
[39:45.65]Mario, there you are.
[39:46.93]I'll tell the Chancellor you're here.
[39:48.69]I'll wait for you down the hallway.
[39:50.59]Because if I get there first... Wait, no!
[39:53.77]Is this the part?
[39:54.27]Is this the part you're talking about?
[39:55.55]This is the part you're talking about?
[39:56.91]This is the part you're talking about?
[39:58.31]Fuck, I ruined it.
[39:59.03]That's the part you're talking about, isn't it?
[40:02.51]I missed the coin.
[40:07.76]In all my years, I've never done that.
[40:09.82]I missed it.
[40:10.16]It's over.
[40:11.04]I might as well just delete this game and stop streaming.
[40:17.74]Sir, Mario has arrived!
[40:19.20]But what about this toad?
[40:20.06]This is a toad, right?
[40:26.13]This is a toad!
[40:27.57]So would he also talk like this?
[40:29.47]Or does he have a lower voice?
[40:38.68]Mario, thank goodness you're here.
[40:43.03]We heard the explosion or something at Bowser's Keep.
[40:46.07]It was so loud I almost popped my s'mores.
[40:51.33]Ah, excuse me, where's the princess?
[40:53.77]She departed for your house hours ago.
[41:00.98]I fear the worst.
[41:02.60]Could Bowser somehow be behind all of this?
[41:16.84]Spores alive.
[41:18.47]You're telling us that Bowser has abducted the princess again.
[41:22.07]Never mind.
[41:25.15]It will be up to you to enter the keep and rescue Princess Toadstool.
[41:29.88]No, you're not getting this.
[41:30.68]Yeah, guys, this is back before Mario talked.
[41:47.82]This is my favorite part.
[41:50.17]Not yet.
[41:53.17]Mario!
[42:14.98]Got a map.
[42:15.30]Where is it?
[42:15.60]Come on, it's over here somewhere.
[42:47.65]This is up.
[42:48.49]I believe this is going to this is a princess's room.
[42:50.63]Yeah The princess hasn't returned yet.
[42:55.83]Can you imagine how the Chancellor must feel?
[42:58.34]I'm just checking for stuff Found toadstools
[43:18.81]Hey, what are you doing?
[43:21.71]I'll give you this in exchange.
[43:22.83]Just leave everything where it was.
[43:28.50]What?
[43:47.05]okay Mario the chancellor has filled me in come let me show you around this is gonna get tiring help yourself to the treasures this mushroom will restore your hit points and flower points unfortunately mushrooms you find as items only restore your HP so beware
[44:12.73]This is a flower.
[44:13.85]The more gathering you do, the more flower points you'll have in battle.
[44:17.59]Find them.
[44:21.73]This is a coin.
[44:22.81]The small ones are worth one, and the large ones are worth 10.
[44:25.89]This one's a 10.
[44:30.37]Do you know about flower points?
[44:32.41]Yes.
[44:33.94]You sure are smart, Mario.
[44:35.68]Alright, now walk that way so I can get the secret.
[44:48.83]Alright, let's go.
[44:49.33]Hmm, I gotta think of one.
[45:00.29]Come back here!
[45:00.63]Ow!
[45:03.06]Get back here!
[45:30.06]Oh no, that reptile stole my grandpa's coin.
[45:32.98]I can't cry.
[45:37.28]Big boys don't cry, but it's just not fair.
[45:40.22]What am I gonna do?
[45:40.98]Good luck, kid.
[46:00.39]Yes?
[46:00.95]Gee, you're soaking wet, aren't you?
[46:05.22]I'm alright now, sorry.
[46:06.50]There's nothing like a good cry.
[46:08.54]But why was I crying?
[46:11.02]There was some reason.
[46:14.48]My grandpa asked me to buy some things for him here.
[46:17.20]When I walked into town, a croc stopped me.
[46:20.82]Oh yeah, he took it from me.
[46:21.94]He stole my coin.
[46:22.88]I chased him, but he was too fast.
[46:26.99]Hey Mario, let's see how you're gonna take on Bowser.
[46:31.97]Wow, he doesn't stand a chance.
[46:35.56]Wait, you're the Mario?
[46:37.88]I know all about you.
[46:38.92]You've got more jump in you than a box of frogs.
[46:41.88]I'm Mallow from Tadpole Pond.
[46:43.84]I'm a frog, but can you believe it?
[46:45.90]I can't jump.
[46:46.52]It's embarrassing.
[46:48.22]How about it, Mario?
[46:49.02]Will you help me catch that filthy thief?
[46:52.52]Yeah.
[46:56.33]The young frog, Mallow, who doesn't look at all like a frog, joins Mario in his quest.
[47:06.65]New party member.
[47:09.79]And... I planned ahead.
[47:13.90]Put on those pants, Mallow.
[47:19.82]What do I have for items?
[47:22.78]Mmm... I do have a flower jar.
[47:24.62]Let's use it.
[47:28.45]I need a couple of mushrooms, I think.
[47:33.31]First, let's save it.
[47:45.69]Wasted the flower jar?
[47:49.13]I did not.
[47:52.66]Alright, let's do, uh... Hey, Malo, what kept you?
[47:55.88]I was starting to worry.
[47:57.84]Wait until you hear this.
[47:58.92]You see... Wait, I've already heard.
[48:02.42]Old Frogfusus told me.
[48:03.74]He seems to know everything.
[48:05.46]Hold on.
[48:06.90]No, listen to me.
[48:08.18]The truth of the matter is, well, um...
[48:10.66]The coin was stolen.
[48:12.49]What?
[48:13.57]Well, if that's the case, I guess we can't trade.
[48:15.95]That's a shame.
[48:18.51]Oh, but there's no need to worry.
[48:19.63]Mario here is going to help us.
[48:22.07]Is that so?
[48:23.39]Well, if Mario's on your team, you'll have that coin back in a jiffy.
[48:28.54]Not so fast.
[48:29.20]Take this with you.
[48:30.42]You'll probably need it.
[48:33.62]Pick me up.
[48:38.12]But I need to buy a couple more.
[48:40.04]I love this job.
[48:41.04]What are you looking for?
[48:43.56]I'm looking for like a couple of these Want to do these?
[48:50.81]One more of these!
[48:53.25]Inefficient, but it's one more of those.
[48:54.93]Okay.
[49:06.64]Hey, what do you think you're doing?
[49:07.64]Get off there in a minute!
[49:18.37]I order you to stand before me.
[49:22.53]I now order you to jump.
[49:28.51]In this world, there are things called hidden treasures.
[49:31.89]Use your awesome jumping ability to look for them.
[49:37.46]I think he got one sitting right here somewhere, don't you?
[49:49.67]Okay, bye.
[49:49.97]Alright, so we have to try to... We have to go to Toad.
[49:55.51]Mario, I have something to report, sir!
[49:58.28]I saw him!
[49:58.80]He's here somewhere.
[50:00.00]He just zoomed past me a second ago.
[50:02.06]Did you see him?
[50:04.14]Did he look something like this?
[50:08.38]Why, yes, exactly.
[50:10.60]He's the one who took my coin.
[50:11.76]Why didn't you stop him?
[50:14.52]Because I forgot my bazooka at home.
[50:16.58]Sheesh, give me a break here.
[50:21.30]Get back here.
[50:24.76]You smugs will never catch me.
[50:26.20]A snail could outrun you morons.
[50:28.42]Later.
[50:36.62]That's him, hurry Mario, let's get him.
[50:38.28]You got anything for me?
[50:45.06]No.
[50:48.00]You're too slow, you're too slow.
[50:50.06]Bandit's way, let's go.
[50:54.94]Hmm.
[50:58.82]There he is, he probably stashed it in that bag.
[51:00.90]Let's nab him.
[51:02.70]Are you trying to tell me?
[51:03.68]Go on home to mommy before you get hurt, kid.
[51:14.67]He does a very high speed.
[51:29.78]One hit.
[51:30.40]One hit.
[51:32.90]Thunderbolt Malo.
[51:35.20]Use Malo's stretchy arms.
[51:44.13]I love the hammer sound.
[51:45.31]It sounds so great.
[51:53.15]You missed me.
[51:54.95]Now this is a frog.
[51:56.07]I mean, it's a... It's like a human frog.
[52:01.59]This game has battles and not just wacky dialogue.
[52:13.80]Um, no, there's lots of wacky dialogue and there are lots of battles.
[52:20.25]Oh, I forgot.
[52:20.77]This game doesn't just have wacky dialogue.
[52:23.05]I'm just checking.
[52:34.92]And he stole one of the coins.
[52:48.33]Oh, fuck.
[52:52.04]Alright, here we go.
[52:56.62]Is this when I... Oh, no.
[52:58.38]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:00.58]Where do you... Sometimes you get stars.
[53:02.32]I know there's something around here, isn't there?
[53:08.26]What about over here?
[53:11.88]Come on, there has to be.
[53:12.66]Right?
[53:13.74]Right?
[53:16.64]If you find a star in this game, you're guaranteed to level up, like, at least once or twice.
[53:21.01]At least.
[53:26.33]No.
[53:27.25]That is... Okay, it is the next room.
[53:28.37]You're right.
[53:28.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:35.01]Oof!
[53:35.43]You're a persistent bugger!
[53:37.23]But I'm a hundred miles ahead of you!
[53:42.01]He is pretty fast.
[53:54.76]Any chests or anything?
[54:07.84]He is fast.
[54:08.88]I feel like you lied when you played this game 500 times.
[54:17.40]No, I play it like once every three or four years.
[54:21.56]No, sorry, I don't go to sleep at night saying all of Croco's lines out loud.
[54:35.88]Why don't you?
[54:37.81]Wait.
[54:53.79]Stupid There he goes it's not worth it It's not a better thing you should be looking give up already that treasure box is tempting but now it's not the time I
[55:12.95]Oh, it is absolutely worth it.
[55:14.65]It's definitely worth it, because we're gonna level up like three times.
[55:20.20]This all counts as a full battle, by the way.
[55:25.12]There it is.
[55:29.36]Bingo.
[55:32.02]Valo has reached level three.
[55:37.11]His HP has gone up by four.
[55:39.53]His defense is terrible.
[55:45.10]His magic attack is... Mallow, I believe, has the best magic in the game.
[55:53.31]I think Peach has it.
[55:54.37]Oh, spoilers!
[55:55.43]Fuck!
[55:57.85]HP Rain.
[55:58.39]Alright, what do you guys think?
[55:59.11]Where should I go?
[56:15.93]Alright.
[56:18.77]Special.
[56:20.19]Magic attack, magic defense.
[56:28.69]I can't click down there.
[56:29.95]Alright, we're doing magic.
[56:31.52]Thank you for voting.
[56:32.28]So this brings us to 18 attack, 13.
[56:34.44]One point at each one.
[56:42.58]That's probably what I would have done too.
[56:44.60]Although, make sure you guys give Malo some HP because he is very, very, very weak.
[56:49.73]VERY weak.
[56:53.73]Like, super replaceable weak.
[56:57.65]Let me know.
[56:59.21]You guys not want me to use him.
[57:00.66]Okay.
[57:06.84]That's why you bring all the pickmails.
[57:10.40]Got another flower tab.
[57:11.18]Alright, I think there's something else I can do over here.
[57:15.28]Winter Squarsh.
[57:17.82]Just gave $50.
[57:19.53]Thank you, Winter Squarsh.
[57:22.25]5,000 bits.
[57:25.09]And they say... Jeremy, the other day I spilled pasta sauce on my keyboard and I ruined it.
[57:31.62]At first I was annoyed, but then I remembered the time you spilled PBR all over your keyboard.
[57:37.85]Live on stream, and I immediately felt better about myself.
[57:40.31]Keep up the good work, streamer.
[57:42.69]I don't drink PBR.
[57:44.29]I've never spilled PBR anywhere.
[57:47.61]That would imply that I had to have purchased it.
[58:02.01]Yes, that was not a PBR, though.
[58:04.83]I think there's no... I'm good.
[58:05.83]Let's go.
[58:10.24]dead end and they won't give up I'll just have to hide this is where he starts adding mileage every time you go find him he's gone into hiding let's see if we can sneak up behind him and catch him full health and okay hey what's up what's this you fools couldn't chase down a pumpkin
[58:40.64]Found you.
[58:43.09]Your eyes are much faster than your feet.
[58:45.01]At this rate, it'll take you 100 more years to catch me.
[58:52.31]Your eyes are faster than your feet.
[58:54.43]At this rate, it'll take you 50 more years to catch me.
[59:01.78]This is getting old.
[59:03.70]It'll still take you...
[59:07.89]Enough!
[59:08.93]You got me fair and square.
[59:10.85]I'll give you back your coin.
[59:15.27]Did you really believe me?
[59:16.11]I was lying!
[59:19.93]False time.
[59:35.40]Eight.
[59:35.86]Oh, he hurts.
[59:40.82]By the way, there are timed hits also on Special Attack.
[59:50.24]Oh, fuck.
[59:52.22]Well, I missed that one.
[59:53.64]I'm telling you, Mallow... Mallow is weak.
[59:57.13]Very weak.
[60:02.81]I might even have to take a mushroom.
[60:06.12]That picked me up.
[60:07.96]Oh boy.
[60:09.32]He's good.
[60:10.00]Alright, now I actually have to heal him.
[60:13.32]No, Mario does the damage.
[60:17.65]Heal yourself.
[60:23.55]Got a freebie.
[60:24.05]That means at the end of the game, or end of the round here, we get something cool.
[60:28.20]Mario's gonna heal now.
[60:31.02]Uh, should I go for damage?
[60:31.90]I'm just gonna go straight up and jump on him.
[60:34.40]And then Malo's gonna heal him.
[60:44.60]It means you didn't use the item.
[60:45.66]I was just testing you.
[60:48.97]He's almost dead.
[60:52.87]Shit.
[60:54.97]Yeah, Malo... Malo is kind of just straight up support.
[60:57.15]Alright, I'm gonna have to use the honey.
[61:04.23]This is a real game for real gamers?
[61:06.99]I mean, yeah it is.
[61:08.25]Did I get it?
[61:10.38]Fuck.
[61:10.90]I didn't get it again.
[61:11.72]Shit.
[61:18.62]I think you have to wait another second after the bomb blows up.
[61:23.48]Alright, I'm out of mana.
[61:30.68]I think he's close.
[61:31.28]Alright, let's go honey syrup.
[61:39.33]Do a raptor noise?
[61:41.75]No.
[61:42.85]I'm not gonna do a raptor.
[61:48.36]When do I get Psychopath?
[61:49.86]Psychopath is incredibly helpful.
[61:56.06]Do it, do it, do it!
[61:57.06]Alright.
[61:59.92]Weird mushroom.
[62:00.56]I think it's heal.
[62:03.05]Yeah.
[62:09.84]You know, fuck it.
[62:10.32]I'll show you this.
[62:11.00]I'll show you this.
[62:11.52]This is cool.
[62:12.78]See if I can get it.
[62:16.16]Got it.
[62:18.98]When you hit that second strike, that's the time tip.
[62:32.15]I think you can do this too.
[62:33.09]Let's see.
[62:33.43]When it flies over...
[62:37.75]Yeah, there it is.
[62:38.64]It's right at the very end when the cloud starts to close.
[62:41.58]Fuck!
[62:43.06]Seriously?
[62:43.52]God damn it.
[62:50.52]Yeah, that was a oof moment.
[62:54.77]You're right.
[62:55.13]Take the honey syrup.
[63:01.43]Finally.
[63:04.06]Alright.
[63:09.24]Still going.
[63:16.84]Why do you have so much health?
[63:22.84]Get out of here!
[63:24.56]How much health do you have?
[63:25.57]I only, okay, I only have two anyways.
[63:49.55]There it is.
[63:50.97]Give me back my coin or I'll beat you again.
[63:53.88]I'm going to pay you back in spades, kid.
[64:01.56]Go on.
[64:02.97]Take back your grubby old coin.
[64:05.75]Adios, amigos.
[64:09.95]Alright.
[64:11.15]We got it back.
[64:15.54]80 XP, 10 coins, flower tab and a Mario level up 20 after 30, that's a big jump for attack and defense that's a milestone of a level and I learned fire orb, yes I did okay don't mess it up
[64:47.48]Malo has more defense than Mario.
[64:54.73]Little dancing flowers.
[64:58.64]Alright, we'll go with power.
[65:01.32]Sounds good to me.
[65:07.31]I would have picked power as well.
[65:14.72]We did it.
[65:15.18]We got Grandpa's coin back.
[65:17.01]I can finish my errand now.
[65:18.83]Hey, look at this.
[65:19.35]That Croco guy left a wallet.
[65:22.09]Found a wallet.
[65:24.15]I'm going back to the shop at Mushroom Kingdom.
[65:25.87]Are you coming?
[65:29.35]There's the fast travel shortcut out.
[65:33.49]Got a wallet, too.
[65:34.21]Okay.
[65:37.57]So that is that part.
[65:39.63]And...
[65:52.91]Got a wallet.
[65:54.64]Let's actually... Let's... Yeah, I'm alright with this.
[65:57.52]Let's test this out.
[66:00.62]42.
[66:00.66]That's pretty good.
[66:14.49]time to grind.
[66:17.13]No, there actually is a spot in the close to the end game that is an insane grinding spot.
[66:23.83]You kill this same little blue thing and it has the most experience pound for pound.
[66:28.00]It takes one hit for the thing to die.
[66:31.52]It's pretty much cheating.
[66:36.88]Alright, back to Mushroom Kingdom.
[66:41.18]There's something wrong here.
[66:45.10]Something going on
[67:03.62]It looks normal to me.
[67:05.12]Shit.
[67:05.56]Alright.
[67:06.80]The fireballs always got me.
[67:08.90]They always did.
[67:09.56]I never block fireballs.
[67:12.72]It's after.
[67:13.68]Or is it before?
[67:14.46]Or is it like second after?
[67:15.70]I forget.
[67:16.74]The fireballs get me every time.
[67:23.69]Use Thunderbolt?
[67:24.39]Not yet.
[67:26.17]Thunderbolt is, yes, it is incredible against these enemies, but not unless there's more than two.
[67:29.89]It's a waste of flower power.
[67:33.34]In my opinion.
[67:39.23]The magic can't be blocked.
[67:41.11]I always thought some of it could, though.
[67:44.65]Like, you can block the slimes that come out of people.
[67:46.44]The little, like, globs that, like... Yeah, you have to... If stars don't come out of you, then yeah, that's true.
[67:53.86]Thanks, Mario.
[67:54.52]I'll continue to stand watch.
[67:55.76]But now everyone seems suspicious.
[67:58.45]By the way, look what I got.
[68:00.31]Alright.
[68:00.73]I need... I need... How many of these do I have?
[68:02.43]Ten coins for one of the... How many?
[68:03.59]Two?
[68:03.81]I already got pants.
[68:30.66]How many do I have?
[68:31.30]Four.
[68:32.02]I need, like, at least five or six of these.
[68:37.76]I'm gonna probably, I'm gonna get, like, seven, eight.
[68:40.84]Let's get another two.
[68:42.39]I'm gonna need them.
[68:43.11]And then another one of these.
[68:44.21]Two more of these.
[68:45.67]Okay.
[68:49.45]Alright.
[68:51.29]How am I doing?
[68:56.18]Looks like a pretty standard, um, pretty standard inventory.
[69:01.18]I got the Watsa worth $123.
[69:02.44]Yeah, that's true.
[69:03.30]Okay.
[69:05.34]Sell the wallet.
[69:09.24]How is this selling a wallet?
[69:10.64]Aren't I just taking the cash out and handing it to the person?
[69:18.03]Yeah, I got bad news for those of you that want me to return this wallet.
[69:28.40]Turns out it ain't worth it.
[69:32.52]I could get everything.
[69:33.34]Okay, fine.
[69:33.92]I'll be a good person.
[69:36.86]We got... Malice doesn't have a weapon.
[69:39.16]I don't think Malice gets a weapon for a while.
[69:45.73]Excuse me?
[69:46.85]You want to... What?
[69:49.05]How can you shop at a time like this?
[69:51.37]Just take what you want and leave some money.
[70:01.89]I wish you luck.
[70:02.94]Alright, let's go save everybody.
[70:11.50]Level up a little.
[70:20.77]He's too scared to stop you from jumping on his furniture.
[70:24.05]Now do it!
[70:26.32]Two damage.
[70:38.28]I thought it was 20.
[70:42.35]Ow.
[70:46.81]Jump on the furniture.
[70:47.79]No, I'm not gonna... Why would I do that?
[70:49.07]You guys... Okay.
[70:50.17]Return the wallet is something that is... Alright, come on, Balow.
[70:52.65]You can do more than two fucking damage.
[70:55.07]Return the wallet is a big deal to you guys.
[70:57.26]But jump on the scared guy's fucking nice furniture in his house is okay.
[71:01.24]Do you understand how I'm having trouble with this?
[71:05.32]With you guys?
[71:08.10]That was too darn close.
[71:09.08]Thanks for the hand, Mario.
[71:11.18]Hey, that's the wallet that the crocodile swiped from me.
[71:13.80]Can I have that wallet back?
[71:19.33]Sure.
[71:22.39]No way.
[71:30.95]Thank you so much.
[71:31.73]Here, I'll give you this as a reward.
[71:33.01]Go on, take it.
[71:35.07]Got a flower town.
[71:39.63]I could have had 123 points.
[71:40.67]But I had to do the right thing.
[71:49.32]Everyone safe in here?
[71:50.10]Just testing.
[71:53.76]So nice to see our young ones having a good time.
[71:57.60]It's scary outside, so let's play indoors, okay?
[72:01.80]But I want to play outside!
[72:04.65]It's too dangerous.
[72:06.99]Yeah, she's like... Oh, wow!
[72:08.19]Look, I can go higher.
[72:09.01]Mario, go fish!
[72:38.12]Yeah, she thinks it's cool because they're jumping.
[72:43.20]She's a huge fan of jumping.
[73:06.23]When is a Jerma jumping stream gonna happen?
[73:07.93]You saw it yesterday.
[73:10.89]The Kinect streams are Jerma jumping streams.
[73:17.71]Hey Mario, look what you're standing in!
[73:20.61]Gotcha!
[73:27.93]Still running the business.
[73:29.21]Still playing your game.
[73:38.07]Was the princess kidnapped by those things outside?
[73:41.03]Are they a part of this?
[73:44.83]Oh, shut up!
[73:53.43]See, I'm wide awake!
[73:55.20]Now I guess it's time for me to win big cash!
[74:01.82]There's a casino in this game.
[74:05.78]Bet you didn't know that.
[74:15.77]He's just bouncing on the door.
[74:23.39]Stop that!
[74:23.79]I'm trying to get at least one more level up for Mario.
[74:30.56]That's pretty important.
[74:35.21]Because Mallow is almost 100% useless right here.
[74:43.62]In a moment, Mallow will be very, very useful.
[74:51.83]Say that to his face.
[74:53.33]I'm standing behind them.
[74:55.48]But I'm talking pretty loudly.
[74:56.72]They can both hear me.
[75:05.60]In fact, Milo, they turn around and look at me.
[75:10.12]All the time.
[75:11.25]To ask me what they should be doing.
[75:17.99]Yeah, she's right.
[75:18.67]I guess we can put it off until things cool down around here.
[75:23.50]I found the perfect place for a wedding, but now we're all stuck inside.
[75:34.14]Everybody's stuck.
[75:35.50]Now we can leave.
[75:37.08]The town is being attacked.
[75:38.70]Eek!
[75:43.01]There are things in our kitchen!
[75:44.41]Help!
[75:45.71]Look, scary things!
[75:46.75]Get rid of them!
[75:50.94]Hope my little brother's okay!
[75:52.96]I'll handle this.
[76:15.95]It's too scary.
[76:17.01]There's two scary people here.
[76:22.55]Yeah, there's two in this room, and I feel a level up coming soon.
[76:33.58]Probably Mallow.
[76:38.70]No, I was wrong.
[76:45.46]Am I gonna beat this whole game on stream?
[76:48.82]Um, I don't, I don't know.
[76:51.94]Probably.
[76:54.68]Maybe not all today.
[76:56.94]It depends, I don't think I'll be able to do it in one sitting.
[77:06.01]This game is like a, this is like a 18 hour game.
[77:10.47]This game takes about 20 hours to go through.
[77:13.66]I don't think that'll be a one and done stream.
[77:26.83]Mallow, nope.
[77:28.97]Thanks, Mario.
[77:30.48]But what about my son upstairs?
[77:32.84]Oops, I forgot all about him.
[77:43.17]I'm scared!
[77:44.03]Boing, boing, boing!
[77:44.87]Now this guy can jump!
[77:45.83]Uh, Mal's gonna die.
[77:46.97]You're killing his friend.
[78:16.95]Why are you doing this?
[78:17.97]You're bashing his friend's head.
[78:20.29]Stop this!
[78:33.40]They were just playing Mario together.
[78:37.54]No, this is dangerous.
[78:39.36]They're monsters.
[78:39.88]They're trying to kill us.
[78:45.96]Really?
[78:46.34]Thank you so much for everything.
[78:48.96]Here's a little token of my appreciation.
[78:51.88]Got a flower tab.
[78:54.50]You're gonna grow up to be just like Mario.
[78:56.54]You hear?
[78:56.90]Am I?
[79:00.58]Yes!
[79:07.46]I can still jump to highest.
[79:08.82]I love this little kid.
[79:13.70]I love this little kid.
[79:17.58]Oh, that's... I love that little kid.
[79:19.56]He's so cute.
[79:20.90]Okay, let's go.
[79:23.68]Faster.
[79:24.22]Go faster.
[79:25.96]No, the poor kid's gonna throw up if you keep telling him to go faster.
[79:29.61]Alright, what do I get for health?
[79:35.51]It's not very good.
[79:38.17]Let's change that.
[79:38.87]What do I have for flower points?
[79:45.59]Eighteen.
[79:47.77]How many tabs do I have?
[79:50.25]I got a lot of tabs.
[79:51.61]I mean, technically I'm not supposed to use these, but I'm gonna need them.
[79:54.81]And when I say technically you're not supposed to use them, if you use a flower tab, it fills up.
[80:12.03]your flower mana all the way.
[80:16.39]But you can only do it from the menu, so that's why it's not what you're thinking.
[80:26.23]The flower tab's increased your max mana, yeah.
[80:28.55]And they fill up your mana as well.
[80:41.85]Here we go.
[80:42.98]Yes, there it is.
[80:44.12]Alright, Mallow is level 4.
[80:45.08]A nice jump on the HP.
[80:46.88]28 HP.
[80:47.24]Yes, you decide to.
[80:48.32]You do.
[81:12.56]Mario is hard carrying.
[81:14.00]Yeah, that's kind of how it is for the first hour or two of the game.
[81:18.59]Sometimes even more.
[81:19.31]For the first, like, two or three hours of the game, Mario is just hard carrying.
[81:24.79]Alright.
[81:27.59]That's it.
[81:31.25]We're doing a magic attack and magic defense.
[81:35.03]Again.
[81:43.28]I wonder if we can get Mario too.
[81:44.46]Now that was really scary.
[81:46.42]Everyone's hiding in the princess's bedroom.
[81:49.04]I and some others couldn't escape in time.
[81:50.60]I hope no one got hurt.
[81:51.78]Uh-oh.
[81:53.30]Toad's lagging out.
[81:53.88]Come on.
[81:54.24]Come on, cocks.
[81:54.70]God damn it.
[82:11.53]700 ping, Toad.
[82:24.23]He's getting the Gmod disconnect message.
[82:26.75]I don't even know what that is.
[82:30.61]Ooh, that magic defense is really helping, though.
[82:34.70]Only took 3 damage.
[82:35.44]Mario's taking 10.
[82:42.37]Oops.
[82:49.14]An aloe is better than Mario.
[82:50.76]Maybe eventually, but not right now.
[82:53.46]Use thunder?
[82:54.04]No.
[82:55.34]Not until it's necessary.
[82:58.30]Because I'm going to waste all of my flower points before I really need them.
[83:05.71]And I'm gonna really need them really soon.
[83:09.55]Saved by Mario again?
[83:10.67]How could I ever thank you?
[83:14.38]I love that.
[83:15.62]He goes like this and puts his back against the wall and slowly goes up the stairs.
[83:20.63]Trapped again.
[83:21.27]Not so fast, pal.
[83:29.32]Look at him.
[83:30.10]Can't even bounce.
[83:31.24]Hey, maybe we could bounce on his head.
[83:45.33]I mean, I don't need a device to bounce, though.
[83:48.01]I can jump higher than you, and I don't need a device to do it.
[83:52.27]So... If I had a device like yours, I wonder how high I could go.
[84:03.06]And then you walk out of the room.
[84:05.00]And that person just is floored.
[84:07.86]And they have to rethink everything.
[84:18.71]Come on, Mario.
[84:19.59]Aw.
[84:21.29]Saved by Mario again.
[84:22.57]How could I ever thank you enough?
[84:28.94]Toadstool's room.
[84:30.62]You're in one piece.
[84:32.46]Thanks to Mario, of course.
[84:34.86]Saved by Mario again.
[84:35.90]How could I ever thank you?
[84:38.76]Oh no, the Chancellor's still in the throne room.
[84:41.72]What?
[84:42.36]That's terrible.
[84:44.42]But with Mario around, we're safe, right?
[84:48.86]You bet.
[84:50.76]There we go.
[84:51.32]Now, hey, wait, hang on for a second.
[84:56.52]Please take this.
[84:57.58]The princess would be happy to know you have something of hers.
[85:00.98]Flower tab.
[85:05.24]I love how sometimes Mario just does like the gym from the office.
[85:10.19]Like flower tab.
[85:11.09]Right into the fucking camera.
[85:12.49]I'm like, geez, okay.
[85:15.15]Saved everybody.
[85:21.28]I'm scared.
[85:23.30]You may not sleep in the princess's bed.
[85:25.30]Have you no manners?
[85:34.98]Alright, I am going to... I'm taking the tabs.
[85:39.56]I don't care.
[85:41.02]I need them.
[85:43.41]What are you doing?
[85:44.29]Dude, what the fuck?
[85:45.23]Idiot.
[85:46.67]What the fuck, dude?
[85:47.89]What's wrong?
[85:48.51]Are you serious?
[85:51.91]I'm changing streams.
[85:52.89]Like, I'm going to a different stream.
[85:54.85]That was it for me.
[86:07.68]I did... I'm gonna do that anyways.
[86:09.54]Alright, relax.
[86:18.14]There we go.
[86:18.84]Now people are asking, when are you going to do Thunderbolt?
[86:21.56]When there's at least three.
[86:23.38]Watch what we can do here.
[86:30.05]Check this out.
[86:37.42]Goodbye.
[86:40.60]And that's a Mario level up right there.
[86:44.65]35 HP, 32 attack.
[86:47.45]Terrible defense.
[86:49.08]And I mean truly awful.
[86:51.00]Let's go.
[86:52.08]What do you think?
[86:53.08]What's the plot so far?
[86:54.46]Bowser... Kidnaps Princess.
[87:15.36]Mario, thwarts Bowser, saves the princess.
[87:20.52]Unfortunately, giant sword crashes down from the sky, at the very end, and knocks everybody out.
[87:27.07]And takes everybody out.
[87:29.09]Therefore, what the heck's going on with this giant sword that came out of the sky?
[87:33.49]That is not a spoiler, you just watched that part.
[87:38.57]We're at the same movie theater.
[87:40.47]And we just watched the same scene.
[87:42.95]Let's say, for instance... Oh, no!
[87:44.85]That's who did it!
[87:46.19]It was... It was Gary!
[87:47.79]Whoa!
[87:48.05]It just revealed on the screen!
[87:49.03]And I go, holy shit, dude, it was Gary?
[87:50.89]And you look over at me in the same fucking theater and you go, What the... Spoilers, dude!
[87:54.61]Idiot!
[87:54.87]Alright, we're gonna do power.
[88:02.16]Thank you, buddy.
[88:06.58]You gotta get Mario some HP, guys, or some magic power.
[88:14.35]Mario needs, like, not- not- alright, well, no HP.
[88:27.32]There just ain't- there ain't no point.
[88:30.96]Why would I get Mario's, like, arms tired for no reason?
[88:37.34]Never hear of a glass cannon.
[88:42.82]The vault!
[88:43.56]Guard!
[88:44.12]I come here to save him and he runs into the next room!
[88:46.96]Oh, so much for him!
[88:49.58]Damn.
[88:56.49]More free shit.
[88:57.17]I'll take it.
[89:06.62]You alright?
[89:09.20]Hey, it's safe.
[89:09.80]You good?
[89:12.56]Never mind that.
[89:13.24]Guess what I found?
[89:13.98]It's a gold coin!
[89:15.27]A gold coin, and it's all mine!
[89:16.81]Oh, hey, I found this in the cellar.
[89:19.47]You can have it.
[89:21.35]Wake up pin.
[89:22.07]Yeah!
[89:27.88]Prevents mute and sleep attacks.
[89:30.62]And it also gives you a little bit more defense.
[89:32.68]So I'm going to give this to Mario, because... I mean, look.
[89:37.53]1822 versus 1970.
[89:37.99]Like, that's much more important.
[89:40.89]Keep Mario.
[89:46.05]Mario is in need of it.
[89:47.69]Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[89:51.43]Okay.
[89:51.93]No one takes our treasure.
[89:52.93]That's true.
[89:59.71]Alright, let's go.
[90:00.99]I think I'm ready.
[90:01.91]I'm gonna save the game.
[90:16.78]I need Luigi.
[90:18.34]I'm gonna make everybody really, really upset about this, and I'm gonna say this, and people are gonna be very, very, very mad.
[90:25.90]Maybe not mad, but... This is a spoiler.
[90:29.06]Should I say it?
[90:29.62]Yeah.
[90:30.08]Who cares?
[90:30.54]It's not a big deal.
[90:35.99]Link from The Legend of Zelda is in this game more than Luigi.
[90:55.45]It's pretty bad.
[90:58.75]Where do you think everybody went?
[91:01.01]Well, look gang, looks like we have ourselves a new home.
[91:05.08]We can bounce around all day and there's no one here who can stand in our way.
[91:09.82]Yahoo, let's bounce the night away.
[91:12.46]Hey!
[91:12.54]Not so fast, pal.
[91:22.42]Look at him.
[91:22.88]Can't even bounce.
[91:23.80]Maybe we can bounce on his head.
[91:35.59]Listen up, gang.
[91:37.31]These guys are gonna put a stop to our party.
[91:41.75]Are we happy about this?
[91:44.61]You're asking for it.
[91:46.56]Ooh, you're gonna get it.
[91:48.44]You picked the wrong people to bounce with, bub.
[91:51.98]How about a fat lip to go with that ugly mustache?
[91:55.36]Here we go.
[92:07.01]Fire in the back.
[92:18.59]Check this out.
[92:25.94]Mac is stunned!
[92:28.16]Oh.
[92:28.72]Don't worry, only four damage, not a big deal.
[92:38.81]Mmm... oh, save it.
[93:00.80]I always tap A.
[93:01.34]6, 4, yeah, you got nothing.
[93:03.74]Alright, we're still fine.
[93:04.66]64, Nintendo 64?
[93:05.66]Alright, I guess I have to take care of Mario here.
[93:10.99]Oh, I got the 6.
[93:32.28]Um, hmm.
[93:34.31]I'm gonna use a mushroom.
[93:36.15]On Mari.
[93:39.15]And they're back.
[93:44.27]Also, I'm gonna use... How much do I... What do I have for flower points?
[93:48.50]Three.
[93:48.86]Alright, I'm gonna jump.
[93:51.24]No, I'm not.
[93:51.66]I'm just gonna hit them.
[93:52.76]I'm just gonna whack them.
[93:54.32]And then I'm gonna do Thunderbolt again.
[93:55.62]And stun them.
[93:57.20]And they can't do shit.
[93:57.94]Okay.
[94:07.19]Oops!
[94:09.57]Didn't work that time.
[94:10.61]I just got instant spawned.
[94:13.35]Alright, so let me do... the... This is kind of bad, actually.
[94:19.44]Alright, honey syrup.
[94:21.86]We both have pretty good health.
[94:26.14]Do it again, quick.
[94:35.89]Can you stun him?
[94:37.31]Stun him.
[94:37.77]That would be nice.
[94:46.48]Do it again!
[94:47.66]Stun him!
[94:51.06]This is why I wanted to save all those.
[94:54.91]You're wondering why I wasn't using the honey syrup.
[94:57.65]And why I wasn't doing thunderbolt, because shit like this happens, you can get destroyed.
[95:05.20]He's done Ain't gonna be much left after this This motherfucker can't even attack me Done.
[95:27.67]That's it.
[95:28.39]See you later
[95:40.51]Yeah, that boss is very easy.
[95:43.75]That boss is not easy.
[95:46.29]At all.
[95:47.41]If you don't understand that Mallow has Thunderbolt.
[95:57.54]If you don't use Thunderbolt.
[96:00.90]And then I got a star!
[96:01.64]I beat that when I was four.
[96:08.78]So did I. Well, I was like probably... I was probably like 12.
[96:18.37]This is not good.
[96:18.83]This is not good.
[96:19.31]The mustachioed one is strong.
[96:20.44]Strong, yes.
[96:20.72]We must warn the boss.
[96:44.20]I'm the fucking king.
[96:50.40]Gracious.
[96:51.52]Oh, it's you, Mario.
[96:52.78]What a relief.
[96:56.23]Once again, Mario to the rescue.
[97:00.21]But who were those... Chancellor!
[97:05.77]Sir, thank goodness you're alright.
[97:09.39]Mario, so it was you who got us through all this.
[97:11.85]We owe you a lot.
[97:17.89]Hmm.
[97:22.77]First the princess, and now this.
[97:25.37]It's too much to bear.
[97:28.81]Mario, how about we ask my grandpa for help?
[97:32.51]He knows everything.
[97:35.01]Excuse me, but who the fuck are you?
[97:38.13]Oh, hello.
[97:38.65]My name is Mallow.
[97:39.41]I'm from Tadpole Pond.
[97:42.13]Well, any friend of Mario's is welcome here in Mushroom Kingdom.

[98:21.45]Could Mac, the sword-like monster who crashed into Mushroom Kingdom, have anything to do with the star piece that Mario found?
[98:30.72]Our heroes move on towards the Kiro's sewers.
[98:38.48]Mario!
[98:41.12]All we can do is wait here.
[98:42.51]Don't let us down.
[98:50.61]Goodbye.
[98:54.30]Uh-oh, sewer level ResidentSleeper.
[98:58.57]Uh-oh, ResidentSleeper coming up.
[99:12.49]I think we just surpassed Ralph.
[99:15.79]Oh, wait, wait.
[99:18.39]Oh, wait, wait.
[99:20.99]Wait, hold on.
[99:22.17]This is the high score.
[99:24.85]Oh, now look.
[99:25.81]I lost because of you.
[99:27.97]Oh, you idiot.
[99:35.10]I'm like, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[99:43.62]Item shop.
[99:44.06]Alright, here we go.
[99:46.45]Hey, Mallow.
[99:47.01]What kept you?
[99:48.05]I was starting to worry.
[99:50.75]Hey, mister.
[99:51.63]I got my coin back.
[99:53.86]Oh, well done, lad.
[99:55.12]Okay, here's the thing I promised you.
[99:57.47]There, make sure it doesn't get stolen, eaten, or whatever.
[100:00.77]Your grandpa needs it, okay?
[100:03.51]Got a cricket pie.
[100:07.23]You bet.
[100:12.27]Mario, thank you so much.
[100:14.37]Grandpa will be delighted.
[100:19.09]You know, I hate to admit it, but I love this job.
[100:21.03]What are you looking for?
[100:22.68]Who are you?
[100:25.33]What do you mean, Luigi's in... Where's Luigi?
[100:27.37]Luigi's in this game more than he is in Mario 64.
[100:30.59]Where is Luigi?
[100:31.45]In here?
[100:31.77]I don't know that.
[100:36.45]Luigi's not here.
[100:44.26]Why does Mallow sound like your dog?
[100:46.78]Because they're both like seven.
[100:51.93]No, there's no Luigi.
[100:52.99]I've played this game 500 times.
[100:54.57]There's no Luigi.
[100:56.71]I know that for a fact.
[101:01.90]Okay, so I have plenty of items.
[101:05.76]Let's move on.
[101:06.30]We're going to go to the sewers.
[101:09.14]He's behind the big house.
[101:10.16]Luigi's not in this game.
[101:15.52]He really is here.
[101:16.48]Luigi, where is he then?
[101:23.70]Find the big house.
[101:29.89]Is this Luigi?
[101:33.95]Trample the monsters.
[101:35.51]Smash them all.
[101:36.55]It'll do you good.
[101:37.99]Trust me.
[101:39.25]On this one.
[101:40.05]Is that Luigi?
[101:48.70]Found him.
[101:55.32]That's not Luigi.
[101:57.96]That was a half-assed phone, didn't Luigi.
[101:59.78]Like, come on.
[102:00.66]I wasn't even trying.
[102:05.56]Kiro Sewers.
[102:11.35]This is the entrance.
[102:12.59]Grandpa says to watch out for Balon, whoever that is.
[102:16.53]It's probably a little dark down there, so keep alert.
[102:29.30]I love this.
[102:32.98]This is the best sound.
[102:34.00]One of the best top five sounds in the whole game.
[102:37.13]Alright, let's go.
[102:52.99]Alright, so this is a little bit of a maze scenario
[103:18.75]Although, I mean, not really.
[103:19.99]It is, but it isn't.
[103:20.91]It is.
[103:21.13]I'm just checking it out.
[103:23.17]I wanted to check it out, check out some stuff.
[103:28.68]There are pipes everywhere, leading to... God, who knows what.
[103:33.88]And there are rats, so this now became your favorite game.
[103:36.46]Shit.
[103:41.52]Shit.
[103:44.72]Shit.
[103:54.48]It's an automatic letter grade.
[104:03.81]Boink.
[104:06.41]He's tired now.
[104:09.69]These little mice.
[104:11.77]Yeah, they're kind of like, um, like little mousers, right?
[104:14.23]I know, this time to... It's okay.
[104:29.86]What was the name of the mouse in Mario?
[104:31.76]Mario 2.
[104:32.42]With the bombs?
[104:39.79]That was Mouser.
[104:41.43]Why am I getting question marks?
[104:46.49]Ooh, pure water.
[104:47.33]Alright, let's go... Here.
[104:53.93]Here.
[104:55.33]Let's go in this one.
[105:00.16]Shit just jumps out at you.
[105:01.32]This is, uh... The game that I make a reference to every... Oh, fuck.
[105:05.78]Oh, no, this is not good.
[105:06.84]This is very bad.
[105:08.02]I forgot about this.
[105:08.76]Alright, this thing's hard.
[105:10.36]This thing's really hard.
[105:11.64]Really hard.
[105:13.22]Um... I was gonna say it's a Dark Souls reference.
[105:15.73]I was gonna say it's one of the things that I reference every single fucking game.
[105:19.33]That's really high damage.
[105:35.27]Don't you dare.
[105:35.91]I didn't.
[105:36.53]So, I... I did not.
[105:46.28]That hurts.
[105:52.55]Does Thunderbolt do anything?
[105:54.03]I wonder how bad Thunderbolt is.
[105:58.83]Zero.
[105:59.91]Oh god.
[106:01.05]I'm dead.
[106:08.07]Good thing I got these.
[106:10.97]Because I'm a scrub.
[106:18.52]Oh, it hurts a lot.
[106:19.68]It don't matter.
[106:20.42]Okay, the Carnicus.
[106:21.62]I have to block.
[106:26.60]80.
[106:26.70]Come on.
[106:29.37]I think I'm just going to block.
[106:30.43]Because look at how much damage this is going to do.
[106:32.45]I'm going to heal Mario.
[106:36.43]With... No.
[106:39.61]Use the honey syrup.
[106:41.42]Pure water is for ghosts.
[106:45.74]Okay.
[106:47.66]Uh-oh.
[106:49.76]I didn't fucking block it.
[106:51.05]Shit!
[107:01.38]It's hard to block.
[107:02.10]It's after the sound?
[107:15.15]Alright, come on.
[107:15.71]This is it.
[107:17.81]Dead.
[107:20.35]Yes!
[107:20.65]A lot of- and flower jar, and a lot of coins.
[107:27.85]Good.
[107:29.19]And I got a true form pin.
[107:31.93]Fuck yeah.
[107:39.73]True form means you cannot be turned into a mushroom or a scarecrow.
[107:42.83]It just essentially turns you off.
[107:45.38]I'm going to get that to mellow.
[107:51.74]And I did get a jar, so what do I got?
[107:53.44]I don't have any pick-me-ups left.
[107:57.40]Well, I have two.
[107:59.03]I'm not going to use this yet.
[108:00.99]I'll use it later.
[108:04.65]But that was good.
[108:05.81]Now I have to go back and save it.
[108:08.97]I gotta make the speedrunner jump.
[108:15.72]I got it!
[108:16.10]I actually- I did it!
[108:16.72]I can't believe it.
[108:18.70]I actually cannot fucking believe it.
[108:19.86]That- literally speedrunners take hours doing that.
[108:22.26]I just did it.
[108:31.19]I watched somebody sit here for four hours doing that one time.
[108:42.18]Ah, I forget.
[108:42.62]I forget what to do.
[108:44.00]I forget where to go.
[108:47.78]That's alright.
[108:57.79]Still got what I wanted.
[109:14.85]Guys.
[109:18.69]I'm gonna have to fill two backpacks full of pick-me-ups if you don't start picking HP.
[109:36.51]You were gonna do that anyways.
[109:45.03]Whatever.
[109:54.86]No one gets HP.
[109:56.14]Yes, you have to have some... You have to have a tank.
[109:59.56]I wanna save it.
[110:08.73]There we go.
[110:14.96]Save it.
[110:16.38]Because I don't want to fight that stupid thing again.
[110:18.58]If you need a tank, you're not DPSing fast enough.
[110:29.03]What are you on about?
[110:31.49]How are you supposed to DPS?
[110:38.40]Without being protected first.
[110:45.81]You can't, like, attack something.
[110:51.77]It's not going to work.
[110:57.21]Drain the water.
[110:59.31]Ah, sorry.
[111:05.94]Miss.
[111:06.52]Fuck off with that.
[111:20.34]Got it.
[111:21.94]Sometimes they try to trick you.
[111:23.64]Not me.
[111:31.43]Endable.
[111:33.33]Use pure water?
[111:35.11]No.
[111:36.21]Too lazy.
[111:36.91]I have to hit X.
[111:49.78]Mario's level 5!
[111:51.86]Ooh, that's a big... that's a big increase.
[111:59.72]Help me, please.
[112:02.04]Pick something good!
[112:04.42]I hope you do.
[112:04.98]Mmm, now this is a fight.
[112:21.67]Damn.
[112:21.95]43-42.
[112:22.01]I can't do this.
[112:25.13]Alright.
[112:25.79]Seems HP has taken- no?
[112:52.69]Okay, uh, I'm gonna close this in ten seconds.
[113:03.75]Five.
[113:04.79]Four.
[113:05.85]Three.
[113:07.01]Two.
[113:08.21]One.
[113:09.12]Zero.
[113:09.72]I- What am I supposed to do?
[113:12.56]Ten.
[113:13.62]Nine.
[113:14.64]Eight.
[113:15.62]Seven.
[113:16.62]Six.
[113:17.64]Five.
[113:18.66]Four.
[113:19.60]Three.
[113:20.66]Two.
[113:21.78]One.
[113:23.27]HP.
[113:23.53]Thank you.
[113:23.83]The water's been drained.
[113:24.79]How is that rigged?
[113:57.23]That's not rigged.
[113:58.05]That wasn't a democracy election there.
[114:10.75]The water has been drained.
[114:12.55]Ah, it's okay.
[114:15.12]I'm glad we went through all that for 3 HP.
[114:21.62]3 HP could mean life or death, guys.
[114:36.20]Jeremiah, are you allowing multi-click on that?
[114:37.86]Because I think I single-handedly won HP.
[114:40.10]No, I'm not.
[114:42.30]It is only on one click.
[114:47.00]Are you openly admitting that you were spamming the click button?
[114:52.00]Openly admitting for manipulation?
[114:56.39]What the heck, man?
[114:58.67]Uh, yeah, I want to go in here.
[115:07.80]Okay.
[115:09.06]I want to get up there.
[115:10.24]I forget how you get up there.
[115:11.60]How do I get up there?
[115:16.42]I know this way to get up there.
[115:18.08]I gotta go through that one and then you jump up there and then you jump up there.
[115:21.04]Shit.
[115:21.43]How do I get that one?
[115:23.61]Okay, it is.
[115:45.29]This must be Bellone?
[115:48.99]Is that a fire hose or his tongue?
[115:54.77]It's a smack attack.
[115:56.39]And you're it, mate.
[116:06.58]Let's try fire.
[116:22.60]Room service has been kind to me.
[116:39.68]Good block.
[116:40.68]Perfect block.
[116:56.93]I can't stand it.
[116:59.15]The hunger.
[117:00.23]The hunger!
[117:02.47]He's dead.
[117:02.83]He's gone.
[117:04.39]That was one of the biggest things of this game when it first came out.
[117:07.30]I was trying to keep a seal on that.
[117:10.64]Because Malo's gone now.
[117:12.32]He picks a character and they're gone.
[117:14.02]He ate them.
[117:15.30]That was a big controversy when it first came out.
[117:17.44]It was like, what the fuck?
[117:18.28]The character's just gone?
[117:33.96]That was scary!
[117:38.88]That's weird.
[117:41.68]I must not have played past that part.
[117:43.00]And I don't think anybody else did either.
[117:46.21]I think when that happened, everyone just kind of assumed that was the... Like the end of that character that pissed a lot of people off.
[117:53.65]I don't think very many people played past that.
[117:55.19]That's why I believed it too.
[118:02.78]Ooh.
[118:04.44]Scarecrows cannot do anything but magic.
[118:06.70]That's fine.
[118:08.02]I'm gonna take a honey syrup.
[118:37.44]sleep sauce oh shit that's not good it's alright I'm just gonna keep jumping on him I'm already a scarecrow so I don't know
[119:06.06]Uh, I cannot do anything now.
[119:07.98]Let's hope that Malo wakes up.
[119:11.43]Oh, I wish that it just hit him.
[119:13.63]I can't do anything.
[119:16.27]I can just defend, that's it.
[119:17.99]Hey!
[119:18.61]Look, Malo woke up.
[119:21.23]I don't have any more honey.
[119:22.55]No, I don't.
[119:24.09]Nope.
[119:25.97]Uh, I have to punch him to death.
[119:33.67]Pure water?
[119:34.87]No, he's not a ghost.
[119:36.75]Uh... Uh-oh.
[119:42.19]I can't stand it!
[119:43.75]The hunger!
[119:45.40]Uh... Hey!
[119:46.94]Mario's back!
[119:51.02]Should be pretty close.
[119:59.30]Eh... That was scary.
[120:02.46]If you defeat me, you still won't beat me.
[120:06.42]Beware the flood.
[120:24.59]Balon must have been lying when he said water would come gushing out of here.
[120:31.37]Mario, do you hear something, or is it just me?
[120:36.53]It's water!
[120:37.95]Quick, Mario, hit the button before we're washed away!
[120:45.34]You couldn't have stood on the button?
[120:47.24]That means he's so light?
[120:49.52]That... He's like... a pound.
[120:55.42]This is the Midas River course.
[120:57.28]Wanna crash course?
[120:58.66]Nope.
[121:00.46]I know you've gotta float down.
[121:01.70]And you can swim.
[121:05.59]And there's coins to collect.
[121:11.63]There's a frog coin right here.
[121:16.05]Got it.
[121:18.81]Alright, I don't- I think I skipped this one, if I remember.
[121:30.58]Which side do I go on?
[121:31.56]Left side?
[121:35.88]Frog coin.
[121:36.40]And I'm going to go in.
[121:40.01]Should I go in this?
[121:41.53]I don't remember.
[121:42.07]I know you go in one of them.
[121:53.74]There it is.
[121:54.06]Come on.
[121:54.36]Give me it.
[121:56.20]Give me it.
[121:57.92]Give me that flower tab right now.
[122:02.03]No!
[122:03.54]Please!
[122:08.94]Get it!
[122:10.28]It's mine!
[122:13.72]Yeah!
[122:17.74]Yeah, now we're over here and we bounce.
[122:19.32]Well, we should get... We can't.
[122:38.70]I think I'm gonna go right this time.
[122:40.52]I'm gonna go in the right hole.
[122:51.17]Gimme it!
[122:52.33]Yes!
[122:57.50]Gimme those coins!
[122:58.86]Spray them!
[123:03.80]There we go again, getting spit out.
[123:04.96]I think that's the end of that.
[123:13.49]Oh, I remember this part.
[123:14.79]That's right.
[123:15.89]Now for the barrel jumping.
[123:17.67]Give me some point.
[123:18.21]I remember this, but hold on.
[123:19.93]You jump from barrel to barrel.
[123:21.60]Time your jumps and grab coins along the way.
[123:23.84]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[123:25.36]Jump onto the next barrel before they collide.
[123:27.54]Right, okay.
[123:28.86]Now I know exactly what's going on.
[123:30.42]You can stay on it.
[123:31.26]If you don't have to jump.
[123:34.21]Alright, let's go.
[123:36.65]Almost forgot to tell you, leap over the fish that pop up or you'll lose coins.
[123:39.82]Alright, let's go.
[123:45.22]Alright, straight.
[123:48.88]And... Again, straight.
[123:52.95]Change course.
[123:53.49]Watch out for the fish.
[123:57.31]Fuck, I missed one.
[124:07.93]No!
[124:08.31]I thought I got it!
[124:08.81]Oof!
[124:17.52]Change.
[124:25.21]Stay on this one.
[124:25.85]No!
[124:26.05]I want to stay on that one!
[124:26.89]I tried!
[124:35.34]Change course.
[124:35.74]Oof, that was close.
[124:44.43]What?
[124:44.65]How did I not get that?
[124:50.73]There it is.
[124:52.39]Wasn't that fun?
[124:53.07]You got 61 coins.
[124:56.43]Trade the coins you got from Midas River for frog coins.
[125:00.06]As a first-time only bonus, I'll give you one frog coin for 60 of your coins.
[125:04.91]If you didn't know, frog coins are the green ones, and tadpole pawns got more info on them.
[125:09.94]You got 61 coins, so you get one frog coin.
[125:13.74]Yeah.
[125:14.82]I will hold your one extra coin.
[125:17.74]Here's something I picked up, you can keep it for good luck.
[125:20.53]You got a knock-knock shell.
[125:24.89]Knock-knock shell... is Mario's... next... weapon.
[125:37.59]Knock-knock show.
[125:38.29]Kick to attack.
[125:38.95]By the way, I think you can do this over and over again.
[125:42.01]Alright, I'm gonna take the first P.
[126:10.14]I'm gonna pee my pants.
[126:10.98]I've been drinking water.
[126:13.58]I'll be right back.
[126:17.67]Two hours of no piss, that's a first.
[126:19.09]See ya.
[130:21.99]Hey.
[130:22.91]Sorry, I want to grab a drink too.
[130:26.79]Jesus.
[130:27.45]Is it time for PBR?
[130:29.29]No.
[130:29.79]This is a pineapple juice.
[130:34.93]Oh, just gonna have a cold one.
[130:53.95]That does sound really fucking weird.
[130:55.87]I'm just pouring a pineapple juice into here.
[130:58.39]Alright.
[131:06.33]Good.
[131:08.87]He's peeing in a glass.
[131:10.15]Alright, back to it.
[131:18.96]So we just got out of the sewers.
[131:21.91]We're now going to Tadpole Pond to go meet Grandpa.
[131:27.95]Where is this?
[131:29.39]It's over here.
[131:53.19]Hi, can I help you?
[131:56.41]Mallow, it's you.
[131:57.47]We've heard all about your adventures with Super Mario.
[132:01.37]You guys beat up Balom, right?
[132:07.50]You know about that?
[132:09.68]See, Mario, the waterways of the world bring news to us here all the time.
[132:15.80]That's why Grandpa knows all the news that's fit to hear.
[132:20.35]Are you really the Super Mario?
[132:22.84]Hey everybody, you'll never guess who's here!
[132:26.83]No, these are not talking frying pans, these are tadpoles, they're huge He's the real thing!
[132:35.79]Doesn't look anything like I thought he would They do say he can jump better than a froggy, I wonder if it's only a rumor I sure can
[132:55.33]Well, Grasshopper, what's new?
[133:02.17]Grandpa, Mario's been helping me.
[133:05.39]I know, child.
[133:06.69]That rainstorm we just had.
[133:08.79]That was you, wasn't it?
[133:13.84]Oh.
[133:14.86]Watch it up there.
[133:16.30]You're supposed to make me look like I'm floating.
[133:18.10]Oh.
[133:29.89]Welcome.
[133:31.11]So you are Mario, yes?
[133:33.27]I am Frogfucious.
[133:34.99]You've come to seek wisdom from me, have you not?
[133:37.91]I've been waiting for you.
[133:39.81]Yes, old wise people can often give good advice.
[133:50.05]But how rude of me.
[133:51.36]Let's get more comfortable.
[133:52.48]Come along and we'll talk.
[133:55.38]Clear.
[133:56.20]Full reverse.
[134:01.43]Tadpoles, don't just float there.
[134:02.97]Make yourselves useful.
[134:07.31]Form a bridge for Mario.
[134:16.70]And we're talking about the music.
[134:17.70]Mm, mm, mm.
[134:30.83]It stops for one second.
[134:35.85]Yes, come into my sanctuary and partake of my wisdom, children.
[134:40.91]Let's see.
[134:42.02]That smithy character that appeared at Bowser's Keep, he is quite formidable, yes?
[134:48.04]And Mario, you wish to rescue the princess quickly, do you not?
[134:51.68]But, oh, if only you knew the truth.
[134:54.38]Toadstool is no longer there.
[135:01.40]Uh, what?
[135:02.54]Patience, young one.
[135:05.12]Let me explain.
[135:06.76]Here is what happened.
[135:11.11]You were rescuing Toadstool from Bowser's keep.
[135:13.93]After defeating him, and just when you were about to free the princess, you heard a loud crash and saw a sword split the sky.
[135:20.43]Like this.
[135:24.24]Whoosh, out of the blue.
[135:26.30]The shark sent the three of you flying.
[135:29.76]Bowser and Toadstool are still lost somewhere out there.
[135:33.14]Now, listen to me.
[135:36.78]You're worried about the princess, but first you need to take care of Smitty.
[135:41.42]His underlings are wreaking havoc in our world.
[135:45.15]Mac, whom you defeated at Mushroom Kingdom, was one of them.
[135:48.75]More will be coming.
[135:52.17]Grandpa, I almost forgot to tell you something.
[135:54.25]We found a star in the castle at Mushroom Kingdom.
[135:56.63]Do you know why it was there?
[135:58.93]A star, eh?
[136:00.57]Most interesting.
[136:02.29]This may sound illogical, but I believe shooting stars can grant wishes.
[136:06.91]And now more than ever, I believe they will play a vital role in the fight against Smithy.
[136:13.87]Was that too much to absorb?
[136:15.59]Would you like a recap?
[136:19.00]No.
[136:20.82]It's quite a situation we have on our hands, eh?
[136:25.92]Wow, everything sounds so dire and serious.
[136:28.72]I guess Mac was only the first of many, Mario.
[136:30.90]Some of them will make Baja seem nice.
[136:34.81]Mallow, you speak as if these things do not concern you.
[136:38.29]You will accompany Mario on his adventure, too.
[136:40.61]Grandpa, what are you talking about?
[136:43.97]I'm only a simple tadpole.
[136:45.93]This adventure isn't for me.
[136:53.24]Mallow, my boy, I've kept this from you until now.
[136:58.41]But you're not a tadpole.
[137:05.16]What?
[137:09.08]I was sitting here on a rainy day, enjoying a snack of crickets, when I happened to see a basket floating down from the falls.
[137:18.43]I peeked inside and saw a little baby staring right back at me.
[137:22.79]The name Mallow was written on his belt.
[137:26.35]I felt sorry for the little bundle of puff and took him in to raise as my own grandchild.
[137:31.52]He had powerful magic and I knew he was more than a piece of fluff.
[137:37.02]I thought surely this child must be from some far off land.
[137:42.18]Grandpa, you mean I'm not a tadpole?
[137:48.92]Stop that!
[137:51.48]Mallow, now is not the time to cry.
[137:54.49]Go with Mario on his adventure and find your real family.
[137:57.85]Your real mother and father are out there somewhere.
[138:04.19]Hey, Mario.
[138:07.61]The boy's magic is sure to come in handy on your adventure.
[138:10.76]You'll take him along, right?
[138:14.78]Grandpa, I won't cry anymore.
[138:16.60]I'll go on this adventure with Mario and find my real family.
[138:20.28]Then it is settled.
[138:21.60]You must embark on your adventure immediately.
[138:25.33]First, go to Rosetown, where they need your help.
[138:41.34]It'll be quiet around here with Mallow gone.
[138:44.38]Maybe a snack will cheer me up.
[138:48.22]Wait a minute!
[138:49.00]That's right, I'd forgotten all about it!
[138:51.46]I'll give you something for the cricket pie you brought back.
[138:55.20]Oh, I... You shall have the staff I used when I was Mallow's age.
[138:58.98]Oh, which has to be in here somewhere.
[139:02.23]The froggy stick will come in handy.
[139:05.41]Do not forget to equip it.
[139:10.25]Froggy stick.
[139:13.33]Holy shit, boy, he's going off script.
[139:28.55]There we go.
[139:36.19]So you can also spend Frog Coins here.
[139:44.83]Welcome to the Frog Coin Emporium!
[139:46.97]You're a first-timer, aren't you?
[139:48.03]Listen up, the green coins you find periodically are Frog Coins.
[139:52.19]Accumulate them and you can buy items at Tadpole Pond.
[139:56.88]So, as you see, this is the real currency.
[140:02.70]Bracer.
[140:04.44]Raises defense, raises allies' battle power.
[140:09.15]Raises party's entire, all the party's defense.
[140:12.75]Raises the whole party's attack power.
[140:16.25]But, I don't, I never used them.
[140:20.03]This is the premium currency, yes.
[140:27.90]Welcome to the juice bar!
[140:28.96]Are you a card member?
[140:30.72]Even Todovsky has a membership here.
[140:33.48]Sorry, you're limited to this menu if you don't have a current membership card.
[140:36.43]I can buy a froggy drink.
[140:40.99]Party recovers 30 HP.
[140:46.93]These are actually pretty good.
[140:49.69]I'll buy a few of them.
[140:50.45]Let's put the froggy stick on.
[141:01.28]Did I get the secret coin that I only have one chance at?
[141:03.40]No.
[141:04.40]I didn't.
[141:12.92]Melody Bay.
[141:14.96]Play notes by jumping on the tadpoles.
[141:16.76]Let's hear your melody.
[141:20.18]Now this is... There are a ton of deep secrets in this game.
[141:31.50]You have to play certain songs for Todovsky.
[141:36.73]And some of them are very difficult to figure out which ones you should play.
[141:48.12]It takes playing through this whole game and knowing very specific random things.
[141:54.47]Is that something you composed?
[141:56.13]No, that's not the right melody at all.
[141:58.31]Yeah, he's looking for, like, the right melody.
[142:00.97]I'm the composer Todovsky.
[142:02.11]I am trying to create my next masterpiece, but I've got composer's block.
[142:06.61]You want a music lesson from moi?
[142:08.39]No.
[142:09.95]Fine, be that way.
[142:22.02]He's still explaining the game.
[142:30.20]I've got this dream of becoming a composer.
[142:32.96]I want to be as famous as Todovsky.
[142:35.75]My favorite song?
[142:37.61]Hmm.
[142:38.33]It's Frogfuscious's suite number 18, Sol ami re do re do re.
[142:44.09]Todovsky's fond of it, too.
[142:47.91]Okay.
[142:48.71]There it is.
[142:49.95]That's one of them.
[142:53.85]Sol ami re do re do re.
[142:56.12]I'm just gonna write it down.
[143:01.18]So, la, mi, re, do, re, do, re.
[143:05.78]So, la, mi, re, do, re, do, re.
[143:10.56]Okay.
[143:16.50]I don't know which one of these is do.
[143:18.22]It's the start, right?
[143:19.64]Do is the first one, right?
[143:20.60]It's do, re, mi, la.
[143:22.22]So up here would be do.
[143:26.11]Is it ascending or descending?
[143:27.13]I don't remember.
[143:28.33]So do, re, mi, fa, so.
[143:33.37]Do, re, mi, fa, so, la.
[143:35.11]So do, re, mi, fa, so, la.
[143:40.62]Do, re.

[143:43.28]Do, re.
[143:44.86]Do, re.
[143:47.20]Do, re.
[143:49.07]So now I just do this.
[144:06.07]Isn't that something you composed?
[144:08.85]No, it's the other way then.
[144:10.93]So it's up this way.
[144:13.19]I did it backwards.
[144:21.63]It was upside down.

[149:04.68]May I help you?
[149:06.05]Oh, an Alto card!
[149:07.31]What would you like?
[149:10.20]I can buy elixirs now.
[149:11.60]Party recovers 80 HP.
[149:14.08]That's a little out of budget, though.
[149:15.73]Alright, now I think... Let me go back here and ask another question.
[149:26.11]I think he's back, and he gives you vague... Yeah.
[149:30.13]He's gonna give me vague things that I need to find.
[149:32.30]Well, maybe not yet.
[149:34.82]I think I probably have to unlock it.
[149:46.86]Just grind until I have 99 elixirs.
[149:49.92]That would be the most boring fucking thing I could ever do.
[149:55.57]I would hate that so much.
[149:57.37]Okay, a roseway.
[150:05.90]You can't jump on or off when the block is blue.
[150:08.78]Try jumping when the block turns yellow.
[150:17.41]Now, these move around in different places.
[150:19.53]I can go... yeah.
[150:22.03]I have to go across.
[150:23.07]Shit.
[150:27.69]It's okay.
[150:30.31]Did he find Luigi?
[150:33.08]Umm... a long time ago.
[150:37.98]I did find Luigi.
[150:39.16]He's doing, like, crack behind one of the houses.
[150:52.61]Alright, I don't want to go that way yet.
[150:54.33]Let me just get that coin.
[150:55.49]No!
[150:55.57]Okay, can I go from here?
[150:57.43]That didn't... Really?
[151:19.76]I love the froggy stick.
[151:20.79]I was gonna say I hate the froggy stick, and I just immediately corrected myself.
[151:24.05]It's a giant enemy spider.
[151:36.31]Yeah, those things suck.
[151:38.27]I'm not blocking these at all.
[151:48.43]Alright, so I need to go around.
[151:50.51]I eventually will come around this way.
[151:57.05]Oh, I remember this part.
[152:02.18]I'm gonna knock them both off and go get the treasure.
[152:06.28]What a fun game.
[152:18.87]I'm not timing that right The giant enemy spider is based on real Japanese history Is it really?
[152:31.39]That's really cool
[152:46.98]Jebaited.
[152:47.44]He's jebaited.
[152:48.30]Are you sure?
[152:51.92]I feel like I've heard that before.
[152:53.02]Alright, I can't screw this up.
[153:03.40]I already did.
[153:03.88]I was gonna walk.
[153:09.59]Damn it.
[153:12.01]Damn it!
[153:14.48]Shit!
[153:15.76]Oh, I blew it!
[153:16.74]Oh no!
[153:17.60]Now I have to- Wait, hold on.
[153:25.54]Okay.
[153:41.83]I fucking desynced it.
[153:44.21]Now I have to desync enough times again to resync it.
[154:01.88]That's good enough.
[154:07.78]I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[154:19.66]Shit.
[154:20.60]I remember this.
[154:21.62]I remember even years later doing this and being like, nah, I kind of don't care.
[154:25.92]I just keep going.
[154:26.66]Alright, don't move.
[154:43.53]Got it.
[154:43.79]Frog coin.
[154:46.76]What?
[154:46.92]I can get that.
[154:48.00]Alright, wrappers around.
[154:49.50]Watch out for those bandits.
[154:51.38]They steal.
[155:16.35]A penny?
[155:16.75]No, that's 10.
[155:17.37]That's 10 coins, the big ones.
[155:24.95]Damn it.
[155:28.87]Miscalculated.
[155:34.52]He picked up a die.
[155:35.12]Yeah, money's worth a lot.
[155:39.00]Come on.
[155:40.48]I gotta spend money.
[155:44.90]Let's see, does it keep going this way?
[155:45.92]It does.
[155:48.18]I missed all of it.
[155:49.39]Every single one.
[155:50.27]I still didn't.
[155:51.75]Unbelievable.
[155:52.55]That's truly not fucking believable.
[155:54.15]Okay, let's go.
[156:15.31]No, hold on.
[156:15.75]I think there's other things I can do here.
[156:20.97]What else can I do?
[156:22.63]What else is this going to do for me?
[156:24.31]Something cool?
[156:25.62]Nothing cool at all?
[156:26.66]There's no secrets?
[156:28.86]There has to be a secret.
[156:32.30]No.
[156:32.94]No secret.
[156:33.56]Maybe there is.
[156:34.18]I don't remember.
[156:34.66]Alright, let's get the heck out of here.
[156:51.42]And... Full health.
[156:58.87]Watch out for the bandit.
[157:03.23]Damn it, he got it.
[157:09.54]Well, why did you run into me then, if you're just gonna run away?
[157:18.54]No facecam, ResidentSleeper, no tuber reactions.
[157:23.12]What am I even doing here?
[157:24.44]Holy shit, he almost insta-killed me.
[157:34.99]Fucking fart on stream.
[157:55.48]I'm not going to do that.
[157:57.56]So don't worry.
[157:58.02]Those of you that are concerned, don't ask me why.
[158:03.00]Those of you that are concerned saying, no, don't, don't do that.
[158:05.40]Why are you assuming that I would do something like that?
[158:15.59]Why would I do that?
[158:19.96]Why would I just turn my ass up and just go like... Why would I do that?
[158:35.71]Guys, I am a super embarrassed farter.
[158:38.63]I want to just explain this.
[158:41.05]I don't fart.
[158:42.43]Unless I go into a closed room and make sure that nobody is within 50 feet of me.
[158:53.64]If there are people within like a hundred foot radius of me, I don't do it and I like escape.
[159:04.70]This is actually kind of bad.
[159:05.60]I'm gonna die.
[159:19.49]Damn it.
[159:20.01]Why did he run away?
[159:21.73]Why did you run?
[159:25.89]Jerma, do you hear me?
[159:27.71]What?
[159:34.40]Snuck that one.
[159:41.91]Oh, it's cool!

[160:31.08]It's fucking awesome.
[160:38.94]Bowser and his troops must be on their way to Bowser's Keep.
[160:42.51]Come on, Rosetown's just up ahead.
[160:52.77]Rosetown.
[160:57.01]Ooh!
[160:58.91]You alright?
[161:01.35]See, arrows come flying out from the forest.
[161:03.67]And when you're hit, you can't move.
[161:06.42]See, look.
[161:07.78]I can't move a muscle.
[161:09.76]Now I know how a scarecrow feels.
[161:15.75]Since the day a shooting star fell into the forest, arrows have been showering our town.
[161:26.24]Get inside, quick, get inside.
[161:29.02]I tell ya, it's scary out here.
[161:31.17]But someone's gotta pump the water.
[161:32.55]Like this.
[161:37.15]One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.
[161:42.65]Someone's gotta do it.
[161:45.87]I'm desperately waiting for the comedic moment where I can make a noise when I get hit.
[161:51.23]But this ain't a comedy stream.
[161:53.48]This is a nostalgia stream.
[162:08.18]Item shop.
[162:12.69]Ding.
[162:16.49]And then to get this one, you gotta fall to the ceiling.
[162:23.87]But hey, why don't we, uh... Why don't we go in here?
[162:27.70]Should I go in here?
[162:28.52]What do you think?
[162:30.02]I think it's time to go in here.
[162:35.40]I know, I know.
[162:35.98]I'm just very excited.
[162:42.68]No, no.
[162:58.72]The audio's desynced?
[162:59.96]Like in the game?
[163:13.22]It's not.
[163:14.34]Luigi's behind the house.
[163:15.43]Oh, maybe I should go find him!
[163:28.55]That's weird.
[163:29.37]Here we go.
[163:37.43]Mario, help!
[163:43.10]Hey, Mario.
[163:43.82]I'll be taking care of the princess toadstool now.
[163:45.64]Boing, boing.
[163:48.77]Super jump attack.
[163:56.15]You think you can hurt me with your childish pranks?
[163:59.11]Attention Toadstool!
[164:00.23]You're coming with me!
[164:01.11]Zip your lip!
[164:02.75]Help!
[164:03.31]Help!

[164:29.40]Well, you have the hat and the funky stash.
[164:31.20]Are you really Mario?
[164:37.88]Wrong number.
[164:41.58]You bet.
[164:42.82]I am.
[164:44.17]How do I know it's you?
[164:45.09]You might just be pulling my leg.
[164:47.29]Show me.
[164:47.69]Prove it.
[164:52.17]Alright.
[164:52.73]Okay.
[164:53.31]Mario, you want to play with me?
[164:54.71]I'm playing Save the World.
[164:57.19]Now, Gaz, Mario might be a little tired, dear.
[165:01.11]Oh, come on, Mom.
[165:01.83]You never play with me.
[165:02.65]It's no fun playing alone.
[165:05.59]Oh, dear, Mario.
[165:07.54]I hate to ask, but could you play with Gaz for a little while?
[165:13.18]Yes!
[165:14.20]Okay, Mario just bought the farm, so you can be Bowser.
[165:18.90]I'll be Geno, okay?
[165:22.43]Ready?
[165:23.07]Let's play from where I left off.
[165:25.69]All set?
[165:29.44]Oh, scary.
[165:30.50]But just watch me.
[165:33.10]Better watch out, Bowser, because Geno's going to blow you away.
[165:35.98]Take this!
[165:39.78]Your turn, Bowser.
[165:42.94]Easy, Mario.
[165:46.19]It's just a game, Mario.
[165:47.99]It's just a kid.
[165:49.83]Ow!
[165:50.75]Oh, no.
[165:51.25]If he keeps this up, I'm finished.
[165:52.89]Alright, you asked for it.
[165:54.59]The super duper custom patented one star, one star at Yelp.
[165:59.45]Shooting star shot.
[166:03.91]Oops.
[166:04.59]I think I missed.
[166:06.97]Oh, Mario.
[166:07.73]Mario, you good?
[166:15.59]Everybody shut up.
[166:16.44]This is the most important thing in my whole life.
[166:46.96]There he is, there he is!
[167:29.35]It's not Luigi.
[167:29.97]You know, for the longest time I thought his name was Genno.
[167:41.12]I was like 12.
[167:42.24]I thought it was Genno.
[167:47.54]That was a 10 out of 10 Mario dream.
[167:59.70]Yeah, Mario, maybe you shouldn't eat like a pint of ice cream before bed anymore.
[168:03.88]Mom, you'll never believe what I just saw.
[168:05.38]It was amazing.
[168:07.88]I just saw Gino walk into the forest.
[168:10.02]Neat, huh?
[168:11.75]Yes, dear.
[168:12.23]That's nice, dear.
[168:13.15]And isn't Gino the one who broke my lamp the other day?
[168:16.05]Oh, my, it was just... This is real.
[168:20.07]I swear, Mom, really, it's true.
[168:22.29]I saw him outside.
[168:23.27]Alright, Gaz, let's hear it.
[168:25.30]What are you trying to get out of this this time?
[168:28.60]Mom, I didn't do anything!
[168:29.72]I've already shot Gino!
[168:30.92]And she's, uh, I guess it's implied that she's, like, screaming at him.
[168:39.89]Oh, this boy is impossible!
[168:43.45]Sorry if I hurt you, but what would Gino want in a forest?
[168:51.79]What would Gino want in a forest?
[169:00.31]I'm gonna buy some shit.
[169:05.49]Mario, good to have a customer at last.
[169:06.95]What do you need?
[169:08.40]What do I have?
[169:10.50]I have eight.
[169:11.36]I need syrups.
[169:12.32]I might as well get five of these.
[169:18.20]Maybe one or two of these.
[169:19.52]A couple more of these.
[169:20.56]Hey Mario, it's so nice of you to drop by the shop.
[169:28.69]What can I do for you?
[169:31.05]thick shirt, thick pants.
[169:34.98]Now we need thick shirt, thick pants.
[169:39.51]Jump shoes are actually really good.
[169:43.96]Wake up pin.
[169:46.24]Prevents sleep.
[169:47.30]You won't be turned into a mushroom.
[169:48.78]Prevents fear.
[169:50.06]These are way too expensive.
[169:54.48]Let's see, I'm gonna sell some stuff too.
[169:56.76]Jump shoes, they, as you see, drop your defense, but they make your magic attack really good.
[170:03.61]Which is my, obviously my, you know, my jump ability.
[170:08.03]What is my defense at right now?
[170:09.05]22 and 19.
[170:12.44]22, and my magic... That's actually... No, that's good.
[170:15.84]I go up to 23 magic attack.
[170:17.66]Yeah, I'm putting it on.
[170:20.10]True form versus wake up.
[170:23.40]Mushrooms, and it prevents mute.
[170:24.80]I don't think this upcoming boss... Does scarecrows.
[170:31.56]But do lose.
[170:32.24]That's right, put the thick pants on.
[170:35.60]Put the thick shirt on.
[170:41.68]I'm gonna keep the wake-up pin, but I'm gonna sell this other stuff.
[170:53.19]Okay.
[170:53.63]I think we're good.
[170:55.91]I'm gonna maybe get a couple more items.
[170:58.03]Alright.
[171:04.51]That should be alright, I think.
[171:09.23]If it's not, it's not.
[171:12.88]You're about to hear the best song in the whole game, by the way.
[171:15.94]I'm seeing a lot of ResidentSleepers.
[171:18.52]I would wake up for this one, because this is the best song in the whole game.
[171:29.27]Still in Rosetown.
[171:30.29]I'm laughing my ass off.
[171:32.99]Yeah, we're going to be bopping here real quick.
[171:35.27]Here we go.
[171:48.91]Into the forest maze.
[171:50.70]You ready?
[171:51.90]Are you ready?
[171:52.84]Are you ready?
[172:16.78]No, I don't, I don't, I don't want to hit the...
[172:46.76]Trip of the arrow.
[172:47.94]Alright, we got it.
[172:49.46]That's why I'm going to be sure to breathe hard the whole song.
[172:53.90]That was a lot of fucking damage.
[172:57.31]And now he's poisoned.
[172:58.27]That went pretty good.
[173:00.61]Uh, Malo's, like, dead.
[173:02.33]He is gonna die.
[173:03.69]Nope.
[173:17.34]I'm going to use one of the mushrooms because... Shit.
[173:21.01]He's almost dead.
[173:22.81]I don't want to use any... Unnecessary mushroom.
[173:32.46]Don't worry, guys.
[173:32.92]The song comes right back right now.
[173:51.24]Isn't there something in these?
[173:52.08]I know there is something.
[173:53.02]I think there's like a... frog coin or something in one of these.
[174:18.31]It's a star?
[174:18.99]Yeah, I think it is a star.
[174:20.39]And... nope.
[174:20.81]Where is it?
[174:21.67]Ahaha!
[174:22.55]You missed!
[174:23.69]What?
[174:24.15]What do you mean I missed?
[174:26.85]You missed!
[174:51.82]How does that make any sense?
[174:53.96]What the hell?
[174:56.15]Did I check this one?
[174:56.95]It's okay.
[175:03.59]What is this song called?
[175:04.59]The song is called Beware the Forest Mushrooms.
[175:09.17]There are probably 500 remixes of this song on YouTube.
[175:18.66]This is one of those songs that everybody just seems to love over and over and over again.
[175:22.91]And everybody thinks it's like the greatest song that Nintendo has ever put in a game.
[175:27.33]And they won't put it in any other fucking game.
[175:30.21]They won't put it anywhere.
[175:31.27]I don't even... Forget about like Geno and Smash Brothers.
[175:33.57]Why don't they just put this song in... Why?
[175:38.41]It's only in this game.
[175:39.60]And everyone's like, yeah, that's probably the best Mario song ever.
[175:44.58]I don't want to hear, like, 15 different Nintendo official remixes of Rainbow Road.
[175:48.98]I want this.
[175:50.64]Gosh darn it.
[175:56.04]Square owns the rights to the song?
[175:59.23]Do they?
[175:59.57]No, they don't.
[176:00.27]What?
[176:00.71]Alright, I need some levels here, guys.
[176:11.27]So there are these characters that Square owns in this game.
[176:14.48]But what the hell are you gonna do with these characters?
[176:18.00]I never understood that.
[176:19.48]Well, you see, the thing is, like, everybody, like, really loves these characters, but Square owns them.
[176:23.54]And, uh, they just lock them in a fucking box.
[176:27.10]And nobody can look at them.
[176:31.11]Nobody can buy them.
[176:32.43]Nobody can look at them.
[176:33.07]Hey, can you guys, like, do anything with those characters?
[176:37.65]No.
[176:39.13]Can you sell those characters to somebody that will?
[176:41.09]No.
[176:43.27]Please?
[176:43.61]Oh, I got Psychopathic.
[176:51.56]Please vote.
[176:55.36]I'm not even like Smash, but like, if, like, some of the characters that they brought into this game, into the universe, they're really cool.
[177:02.00]They're really fun, interesting characters.
[177:03.36]They could be put anywhere.
[177:04.24]You could put them in another Mario game, for all that matters.
[177:14.81]You guys are going straight up magic, huh?
[177:16.19]Alright.
[177:16.53]That's what we're doing.
[177:17.80]29, 30, 21, 22.
[177:18.14]He's doing a lot of damage.
[177:39.38]Square didn't even let Final Fantasy music in for the Final Fantasy characters in besides one track.
[177:47.56]Shit, I missed it.
[177:58.02]I wonder like how much.
[177:59.88]Was it just like a stupid amount or something?
[178:04.35]I wonder if Nintendo ever approached Square and said, Hey, can we just buy all the intellectual property of the characters that are in that Mario game?
[178:13.05]This seriously is like a Disney and Sony fucking bullshit.
[178:16.52]That really is what this is.
[178:18.52]Disney and Sony come together and do like Spider-Man movies.
[178:21.88]And then... Yeah, that's the exact same thing that happened.
[178:33.23]That was a rock.
[178:41.08]Because now there's a bunch of these cool characters that we... It's just... No, sorry.
[178:47.77]You can't say anything about them ever again.
[178:50.17]Just enjoy the thing that existed that one time.
[178:53.36]Why can't you just enjoy this thing?
[178:56.34]I do enjoy this thing.
[179:00.62]Well, good.
[179:01.08]This thing was 20 fucking years ago.
[179:04.21]Well, enjoy it.
[179:05.95]I know, but can I have another one?
[179:08.97]No, enjoy this one!
[179:10.61]I already do!
[179:12.94]I love it so much that I want you to do another one so I will buy it.
[179:16.24]No, go back and play that one again.
[179:17.64]Uh-oh, I'm getting angry.
[179:33.39]He's losing it.
[179:39.27]Ooh, first time, Ted, I didn't do all night.
[179:41.45]What an embarrassment.
[179:53.50]It's all Disney's fault.
[179:56.48]Alright, we got Mario here.
[179:59.84]Hey, thank you, JermaSucks, for the five community subs.
[180:05.37]Appreciate that.
[180:05.97]Thank you.
[180:07.72]We got Super Jump.
[180:17.69]What do you guys want to go now?
[180:20.36]Everybody gave me so much shit when I talked about it in the very beginning of this stream.
[180:24.20]That when I was younger, I just picked power only for a character, HP only for another character, and magic only for another character.
[180:32.87]And I was called a doofus.
[180:35.67]And now you guys are doing that exact thing.
[180:47.21]Okay.
[180:48.29]That's 65% want me to continue to do power.
[180:53.71]Uh, Jeff just came in with five community subs.
[180:55.47]Thank you, Jeff.
[180:58.67]Thank you, Jeff.
[181:00.21]And JermaSubs.
[181:01.01]Both of you.
[181:03.61]You said not to ruin your childhood.
[181:05.63]Yeah, oh, that's true.
[181:06.31]I did say that.
[181:07.17]Don't do that.
[181:14.06]I know what's in one of these.
[181:19.62]Is this the last one?
[181:20.66]Is it in this one?
[181:23.70]Did I, like, bait myself on a thing that I'm misremembering?
[181:27.44]Uh, thank you, The Fax Machine.
[181:31.68]This is three sub drops right in a row.
[181:34.56]Fax Machine with five community subs, thank you.
[181:37.48]Jeff, GermaSucks, and Fax Machine.
[181:39.24]This is just like E.T.
[181:46.63]on the Atari.
[181:48.73]Mal is dead.
[181:56.43]And like I said, it doesn't even need to be a Mario, like, just anywhere.
[182:01.22]I would love it if Mallow was, like, taught, like, fucking healthy eating habits in, like, a DS game or something.
[182:07.38]Like, I would, it'd be fine.
[182:08.44]It'd be cool.
[182:18.65]Why?
[182:20.35]It would be cool.
[182:21.47]I don't know.
[182:24.01]For your son or daughter to think it was cool.
[182:32.63]That would piss me off.
[182:35.71]Why would that make you so mad?
[182:38.75]That would piss me off if he was like in a vegetable eating tutorial game.
[182:48.42]Just play WoW Classic.
[182:51.79]No, I'm not gonna play WoW Classic.
[182:59.37]Alright, I think I'm... I got an opportunity here.
[183:01.91]I need to take a mushroom.
[183:04.19]How am I doing on... I got a flower jar.
[183:08.33]Let's just use it, might as well.
[183:09.45]Pick up... Whatever.
[183:17.91]I was gonna say, remind me to pick those up.
[183:24.32]Some of them are poisonous, though, I think, yeah.
[183:38.04]Pick those ones up.
[183:38.78]No one.
[183:40.88]I'm looking for secrets.
[183:41.72]Wait a minute.
[183:48.98]The first Jerma stream I tuned into was WoW and it put me off from watching you for years.
[183:55.76]Holy shit!
[184:01.21]Well, what are you doing here?
[184:02.57]What made you come back?
[184:10.47]You know, like, okay, as, like, a broadcaster, that is, that, like, is so horrible to hear that, but I understand why.
[184:17.94]That's the worst part about all that.
[184:21.30]Like, hearing that, oh, no, dude, I watched that stream and I was like, I'm not fucking watching this person for, like, years.
[184:26.04]Like, I'm like, oh, fuck, man, really?
[184:27.74]But I know why you said that.
[184:33.10]What do you mean, LOL broadcaster?
[184:37.05]What is this?
[184:40.59]I'm sorry.
[184:41.31]Am I doing like... Am I doing like messages in fucking... Like... I was gonna say smoke signals.
[184:52.44]But I couldn't find the word.
[184:56.18]Check this out.
[184:56.58]This is gonna be fucking awesome.
[185:09.73]No, don't all run away.
[185:10.89]I wanted to get this.
[185:17.44]Broadcaster LOL.
[185:20.66]That's a lot of coins.
[185:22.96]He thinks he's a broadcaster.
[185:29.02]Whatever.
[185:29.42]Alright, let's heal up.
[185:42.00]wasteful but I don't care and I'm gonna take this flower jar and I pissed off at least two people they're not gonna watch for years after I did that here we go
[186:03.58]Follow him.
[186:05.01]Now there is a secret in this forest.
[186:08.87]I forget what it is.
[186:11.05]You don't actually follow Juno.
[186:12.89]You do a different path and it gives you a huge treasure.
[186:15.79]I don't remember which way it is.
[186:17.03]I forget.
[186:19.23]I'm sure I'll come back.
[186:26.12]I just got double tapped.
[186:32.06]Do you want the directions?
[186:33.78]Ah!
[186:36.70]No.
[186:37.72]No, I don't think so.
[186:46.83]Somebody gives it to you eventually.
[186:53.03]I want this to be an organic experience.
[187:02.44]He thinks he's broadcasting right now.
[187:10.18]Where are you Gino?
[187:10.84]There you are.
[187:12.16]No!
[187:20.33]For some reason I have this weird image in my brain of if I ever did like an event where I was on a stage or something.
[187:26.97]I get for Twitch, like, oh, TwitchCon, and here's jermaOn A5.
[187:31.75]And all you guys come, a bunch of people are there that know me, and I'm doing something, something live in person.
[187:39.22]And they announce me as like, and here he is, ladies and gentlemen, your favorite broadcaster, Jerma, and the crowd just erupts in fucking laughter.
[187:48.26]You know, like, is that what would happen?
[187:52.21]Like, he takes you to the broadcaster.
[187:55.42]And then I would get wicked nervous backstage.
[187:58.04]I'd be like, what the fuck, man?
[188:01.08]I would have my magician's outfit on.
[188:02.62]I'd have all my cards, all my tricks, all my coins.
[188:06.45]And I would choke.
[188:07.13]I need to heal.
[188:23.56]Where'd he go?
[188:24.60]Was I too slow?
[188:29.96]Where is he?
[188:31.86]I'm lost.
[188:32.40]Where... No!
[188:33.42]Where did he go?
[188:38.13]Now I feel bad.
[188:38.93]Alright, where's the electricity?
[188:42.65]Man, that's a lot to the, uh, flying bug bees.
[189:02.98]Have I played any of the Mario & Luigi games?
[189:04.50]I have not.
[189:06.74]I have played... Actually, no, that's not true.
[189:08.96]I did play Super Star Saga.
[189:12.97]I played Super Star Saga, and that's it.
[189:20.25]Where'd you go?
[189:36.64]Come here.
[189:39.34]Got it.
[189:39.50]999, 998, 999, a thousand.
[189:39.92]A thousand arrows.
[189:40.42]For cover they run.
[189:50.91]Fun this is, yes.
[189:53.57]Another 1,000 I will shoot.
[190:06.50]Mario, this guy, he must be the one shooting all the arrows.
[190:14.02]Happy I am.
[190:15.40]Look at their expressions when freezed, they do.
[190:19.40]Whoa, they're standing like statues.
[190:23.41]Yeah, more practice do I need.
[190:29.63]Oh no, he's not stopping, we gotta do something.
[190:33.51]Who do you think you are, Bruce Lee?
[190:35.73]You can't just go in there with your fist flying.
[190:38.59]There's too many of them.
[190:39.33]We'll be creamed.
[190:42.50]Oh no, someone's coming.
[190:44.04]Let's hide and see what we can learn.
[190:50.30]Look what I found, boyer.
[190:53.54]Boyer.
[190:55.17]What?
[190:55.81]What?
[190:56.59]Disturb me?
[190:57.33]You must not.
[190:57.93]Practicing I am.
[190:59.49]More arrows must I shoot?
[191:00.71]More statues must I make?
[191:03.87]I don't know.
[191:04.67]I don't know what to do.
[191:07.12]Stop.
[191:07.78]No.
[191:08.56]Stop.
[191:09.28]Stop.

[191:21.10]Stop.
[191:21.40]Stop.
[191:26.91]Hold it right there.
[191:28.55]You don't know what you're doing.
[191:30.05]Return that star to me.
[191:33.85]Stranger you are, and strange looking at that.
[191:37.13]Teach you we must who's in charge.
[191:42.39]Yeah?
[191:43.49]And who might you be?
[191:46.16]I serve a higher authority.
[191:49.52]That star piece belongs to everyone.
[191:52.54]You can't keep it.
[191:57.43]Angry I am.
[192:00.19]A lesson I will teach you.
[192:06.48]The hedgehog.
[192:08.72]Hey, chill out.
[192:12.44]Mario, it's dangerous out there.
[192:17.85]You're gonna help, huh?
[192:19.21]Whack that weirdo?
[192:20.55]Save the guy in blue?
[192:22.63]Me too.
[192:24.21]I will do what I can.
[192:26.41]But from over here.
[192:34.22]I'm not afraid.
[192:35.02]And I'm not going to cry.
[192:37.44]Yes, you are.
[192:52.05]Stop it, that's enough!
[192:54.47]Hold on, I'll get a better one.
[192:58.63]Strong you are.
[192:59.55]But stronger am I. Hurt you I will.
[193:03.07]So long.
[193:04.43]Part now, we must.
[193:14.34]What the?
[193:17.28]Thanks for the help.
[193:18.58]But, who are you?
[193:24.67]Mario, you just ditched me back there.
[193:30.77]Huh?
[193:32.03]Don't I know you?
[193:33.51]You look familiar.
[193:36.84]So you're the Mario.
[193:39.36]We know about you.
[193:41.86]Knock, knock.
[193:43.30]Insulted I am.
[193:50.99]Do the Mario.
[193:56.63]Shit, I fucked it up.
[194:05.46]Now three against one.
[194:07.56]Not fair.
[194:08.98]Fix it, I will.
[194:10.52]Shoot it however I shall.
[194:12.30]When a target it hits, that button locked.
[194:30.57]Thank you.
[194:30.99]Alright, I gotta get it this time.
[194:47.27]Psychopath.
[194:54.36]556 HP.
[194:54.50]What's with these folks?
[194:58.60]No more Y. That hurts.
[195:03.50]Alright, no more Y. Should I heal?
[195:16.12]No.
[195:21.97]Ow.
[195:23.19]Fuck.
[195:23.93]That's like 50% of all of my health.
[195:25.71]Okay.
[195:26.35]I'm fine.
[195:28.33]Alright, no more A. Off.
[195:44.79]Bolt!
[195:47.23]Mario's dead.
[195:59.05]Try for it again.
[195:59.73]I got Y back.
[196:00.31]84!
[196:00.33]Just got destroyed.
[196:08.53]Psychopath! 290.
[196:30.13]That hurt.
[196:30.83]A lot.
[196:31.85]Geno beam!
[196:32.53]Here we go!
[196:34.33]This is why you came to this stream.
[196:41.58]I didn't do it right.
[196:58.94]Nice.
[197:05.59]Broadcaster.
[197:07.67]LOL.
[197:08.41]Alright, so if any- I can't die here.
[197:19.14]He's dead, don't worry.
[197:26.04]Here we go, let's do it again.
[197:32.43]I didn't do it right again!
[197:33.47]Fuck.
[197:33.89]What am I doing wrong?
[197:35.79]Because he like jumps in the air and lands.
[197:39.73]How am I timing that wrong?
[197:49.36]No more A's.
[197:52.80]Static!
[197:53.08]Uh-oh.
[197:56.44]That's not good.
[197:58.02]Uh...
[198:01.17]Use the mushrooms.
[198:01.87]This is a heal round.
[198:04.83]Yeah.
[198:12.54]Just YOLO it.
[198:14.66]No, I can't do that.
[198:15.38]I gotta play it safe. 12.
[198:29.11]Oh, shit.
[198:29.83]Okay.
[198:38.60]I still don't know the timing of the Geno specials.
[198:40.48]Neither do I. I really don't.
[198:51.95]Dead.
[198:52.71]Yeah!
[198:55.05]You just have to hold Y. Yeah, but then you let go and you hit Y again.
[198:57.61]And it does an extra thing.
[199:01.13]Flower Box.
[199:05.22]Thanks for the help.
[199:06.50]You really got me out of a jam.
[199:09.30]Why are you staring at me?
[199:11.06]You know I'm more than just a doll, don't you?
[199:16.08]The hell?
[199:17.61]Have you guessed the truth?
[199:18.55]I'm a visitor from above, and this is a form I'm borrowing briefly.
[199:27.28]You mean like from the sky or something?
[199:30.80]Higher than that, I'm afraid.
[199:33.69]Do you two know anything about the Star Road?
[199:36.37]Got it.
[199:38.39]Completely in the dark, eh?
[199:40.39]Well, it's a big mess up there right now, and it concerns you too.
[199:44.60]Let me explain.
[199:46.62]You've heard of wishing upon a shooting star.
[199:51.08]At the Star Road, your wish is transformed into a star.
[199:55.10]When it's granted, it then turns into a shooting star and falls down to Earth.
[200:00.83]So you see, the Star Road plays an integral role in granting wishes.
[200:06.38]But ever since the sword destroyed the Star Road, everything's come to a halt.
[200:11.38]No stars have been made since.
[200:13.62]The way things stand, yours is a world where wishes can't come true anymore.
[200:23.24]Are you saying this star is part of your star way?
[200:27.46]That star road, my fluffy little friend.
[200:30.64]Yes.
[200:32.04]That star is a broken piece of the star road.
[200:34.64]I'm here to find them all and repair the star road.
[200:38.58]The broken star pieces.
[200:40.86]There are seven altogether.
[200:44.21]For peace to return, we must get rid of Smithy, find the star pieces, and repair the star road.
[200:51.01]I'm...
[200:52.26]But it's hard to pronounce.
[200:53.68]So just call me Geno.
[200:55.13]After the door.
[200:57.67]I chose him because he looked the strongest out of all the dogs.
[201:02.43]Now grab the star, Mario.
[201:09.43]I don't know what to do for a voice.
[201:11.63]I've never had a headcanon for Geno.
[201:14.67]To me, it was always just do nothing.
[201:17.61]I don't have any headcanon for Geno.
[201:34.21]Two out of seven.
[201:38.82]That just means you thought he sounded like you.
[201:40.42]Yeah, alright, that's what he is.
[201:42.44]Come on, let's get this show on the road.
[201:47.58]Gino, who is searching for the pieces of the Star Road, joins Mario and Mallow.
[201:52.46]Things are definitely looking up.
[201:57.91]Whoa.
[202:00.56]I heard everything.
[202:02.06]Who would have known that that star was so important?
[202:05.43]I've got to inform Smitty.
[202:08.93]And I'm off!
[202:10.99]The secret to the shooting stars has been unraveled.
[202:13.70]Find the star pieces and bring peace back to Mario's world.
[202:19.84]On the next episode...
[202:28.40]I gotta get out of here.
[202:31.02]Back to Rosetown.
[202:31.78]Pipe Vault to Moleville.
[202:32.94]The game has now opened up.
[202:34.04]I'm gonna sneeze.
[202:37.23]Here's the real song for Rosetown.
[202:46.97]I wanna go meet my favorite character.
[202:54.81]What's taking Daddy so long?
[202:56.03]Do you think he's still looking for the treasure?
[203:05.49]What was that?
[203:11.23]He's out getting cigarettes.
[203:12.53]What the fuck?
[203:18.47]Thanks a million, Mario!
[203:20.03]Say, were my treasures okay?
[203:22.95]They sure were!
[203:24.05]Oh, that's great news!
[203:25.73]What a relief!
[203:37.15]What?
[203:37.31]They're gone!
[203:37.79]Mario, you're the only one who can reach them!
[203:39.50]I don't know anything Alright, I'll take your word for it Excuse me, I didn't hear you Uh, I'm sorry
[203:52.50]Oh, well.
[203:53.68]Since we didn't get hit by any arrows, I'll tell you a secret.
[203:56.36]Enter the forest when you hit an area with four paths.
[204:00.09]Go left, left, straight, right, in that order.
[204:04.59]You'll surely find something.
[204:06.21]Left, left, straight, right.
[204:09.03]Nice.
[204:21.24]Okay.
[204:23.07]Everyone's having fun again.
[204:27.15]There is a very elaborate thing in this town.
[204:34.49]I forget where it is.
[204:35.93]Where's the guy with the seed?
[204:42.30]Isn't there another part of this town?
[204:43.74]Alright, left, left, straight, right.
[204:59.93]Dude, I would bet anybody any amount of money that I would destroy them in Twitch sings of humming this song.
[205:32.40]It's off rhythm because it's out of sync.
[205:34.32]Hold on.
[205:38.24]So you tell me that game audio is early.

[210:40.04]Is he going insane?
[210:42.28]Um...
[210:47.55]I don't think so.
[210:52.05]What do you think?
[210:53.15]Tell me in the comment section.
[210:54.73]He thinks there's a comment section.
[210:59.57]What are you guys doing?
[211:17.62]Those comets.
[211:18.56]Pipe vault!
[211:21.96]Alright.
[211:22.85]Now, this is gonna be fun.
[211:25.23]If you guys don't know what the heck this is.
[211:29.77]Oh, yeah.
[211:32.51]Old school Mario.
[211:50.31]This is very high damage.
[211:57.11]Stop it!
[212:30.32]Which one which one which one which one last one which one which one which one which one No, I want to get the frog coin
[212:58.25]I'm gonna go on that one.
[213:00.09]No, I'm not.
[213:03.31]What was that?
[213:03.77]These guys have a lot of health!
[213:12.40]Oh my god, they have like 300 HP each!
[213:28.73]That was like a rare spawn.
[213:29.75]Alright, nothing in there.
[213:44.44]What an old school- this is just old school Mario, I love it.
[213:48.76]They don't make them like these anymore.
[213:49.98]They don't make these anymore.
[213:51.46]Except that's- that's- they still continue to.
[213:54.64]They've made- they keep making them.
[213:58.96]In fact, you can make them now.
[214:02.73]You, right now, can go make an entire Mario game, if you want.
[214:06.53]If you'd like to.
[214:07.09]Why can't they have... I want to make Mario RPG.
[214:14.22]Why can't they have... Why is there no Mario RPG template in Mario Maker?
[214:38.12]Because Square owns the rights.
[214:42.99]How much would it really cost for Mario RPG IP?
[214:48.79]Honestly.
[214:50.81]How much is that actually going to cost?
[214:57.46]It can't be worth more than a couple million dollars.
[215:00.86]Right?
[215:01.54]It can't be.
[215:04.51]Maybe like five to ten million dollars, maybe tops.
[215:10.19]Oh shit.
[215:21.77]Here we go.
[215:23.49]I can't wait.
[215:25.51]I love this place.
[215:27.73]It's my favorite.
[215:31.95]Oh, it's Yoshi's Island.
[215:53.29]This is when they used to have Yoshi be Donald Duck.
[215:58.16]Instead of chocolate dust!
[216:10.93]Mario!
[216:12.15]Glad you finally made it to Yoshi Island!
[216:14.27]Home of the Mushroom Derby!
[216:16.52]Say now, Yoshi, now that you're here, we could use your help!
[216:20.30]Please, talk to a few of my pals here, and- What?
[216:24.69]You can't understand them?
[216:26.23]Well, have a board and I'll be your interpreter!
[216:29.83]Oh, Yoshi!
[216:33.67]What are you, cracked?
[216:34.75]Racing's my life, and I could run all day.
[216:39.47]What are you looking at?
[216:41.48]If you want to challenge me, you have to bring cookies!
[216:56.14]It would be so much better if we could all race together.
[217:04.12]Boshi here is the fastest runner, but he's full of himself.
[217:13.23]What are you looking at?
[217:14.43]You want to challenge me?
[217:15.21]You can bring cookies!
[217:19.63]Where do you get cookies?
[217:20.32]I forget.
[217:23.64]Check the mail.
[217:26.04]Hey!
[217:27.10]There's a letter in here, but I can't read it.
[217:29.96]I can read.
[217:34.36]Honeymoon reservations for two.
[217:35.74]Mushroom travel agency.
[217:36.92]There's a letter in there.
[217:39.22]Honey... Wait, what?
[217:39.70]What is it?
[217:41.06]Honeymoon reservations for two.
[217:42.49]Mushroom travel agency.
[217:46.59]There's nothing in here.
[217:48.41]You gotta bring cookies and then he lets us, like, race together.
[217:57.76]Doesn't somebody give you free cookies somewhere?
[218:03.41]I swear somebody has a cookie.
[218:06.21]One of you guys has a cookie.
[218:09.87]Think you can beat Boshi?
[218:11.55]Take my cookies.
[218:12.41]Good luck.
[218:13.67]Here we go.
[218:15.45]Thanks.
[218:16.25]I've got major support on my side, so I can probably win today.
[218:19.31]Yoshi got some cookies.
[218:26.27]So, you want some cookies?
[218:28.43]Alright.
[218:29.47]Consider yourself lucky today.
[218:31.47]You got yourself a race.
[218:33.23]One on one.
[218:37.93]Hello again.
[218:38.81]Get ready.
[218:39.33]The Mushroom Derby is coming up.
[218:40.61]Want instructions.
[218:42.46]I actually don't remember how to do this.
[218:44.68]Press A and B alternately along with the rhythm.
[218:48.66]The tighter the rhythm, the faster you go.
[218:56.16]So, yeah, you have to go with the rhythm.
[218:57.71]So it's like... Press the Y button during a race to eat a cookie.
[219:04.75]It's energy and will help you go faster.
[219:06.07]Uh, I'm fine.
[219:11.97]Let's practice.
[219:12.53]One, two.
[219:16.29]One, two.
[219:19.33]One, two, three, four.
[219:26.59]I got it.
[219:27.11]I'm gonna destroy him.
[219:30.19]Let's go to the race!
[219:30.95]And... I'm ready!
[220:00.46]I cheated.
[220:05.77]Wow, unbelievable.
[220:06.81]You just beat Yoshi.
[220:09.03]Starting today, Yoshi can do water rugby.
[220:12.31]Since when have you been able to sprint like that?
[220:14.49]Oh, well, I had my day this time.
[220:15.85]Let me give you a tip.
[220:16.73]Race a bit slow.
[220:18.05]Then you'll be able to snatch away the cookies.
[220:26.35]But we don't need a boss.
[220:27.51]Anyway, I just want to race.
[220:31.10]Ow!
[220:31.48]What the fuck was that?
[220:33.06]It's got, like, bit by a bug.
[220:35.22]Come on, Boshi, let's see what you're made of!
[220:37.44]Hmm.
[220:38.48]Alright.
[220:40.26]Oh, here's the cookie stash.
[220:46.58]We don't need a boss.
[220:48.60]Thanks to you, Mario, I finally beat that rascal, and we can all race together now.
[220:52.90]Here's something to remember me by.
[220:54.94]Got a Yoshi cookie.
[220:58.64]What?
[221:00.07]You're carrying a lot of things.
[221:01.27]I'll store these two for you.
[221:02.61]Don't worry, I won't eat them.
[221:04.53]That makes a total of two.
[221:05.33]Next time you're in trouble during battle, use this.
[221:13.89]Give me a call.
[221:14.37]Yeah, you can... Yoshi has a summon, apparently.
[221:17.43]Um, I don't have any... I'm out of room?
[221:22.55]Oh, goddammit.
[221:26.03]I can get, like, a bunch of Yoshi cookies.
[221:27.87]Who needs to heal?
[221:29.12]Who cares?
[221:33.36]Yoshi, give me those back.
[221:39.56]How do I get the cookies?
[221:42.60]He said he's holding them for me.
[221:43.56]Where?
[221:46.57]There's nothing in here.
[221:47.35]Where's your cookie stash?
[221:56.23]Where's the cookie stash?
[221:58.88]He said he was going to store them.
[221:59.80]He said he wasn't going to eat them.
[222:04.08]You looking at me?
[222:04.62]No.
[222:07.66]Nice weather, huh?
[222:10.24]That can't happen twice.
[222:11.30]He gave you it.
[222:19.51]No, I want my cookies.
[222:20.59]He said I have two.
[222:25.19]He gave me one.
[222:29.05]I eated all the potato chips.
[222:30.65]What does that mean?
[222:33.38]Yoster Island.
[222:40.68]To Moleville.
[222:45.42]Here we go.
[222:46.18]Moleville.
[222:51.57]Somebody stole all of your cookies.
[222:55.71]Moleville.
[223:15.50]Dinah went to the mountain with little might but a star crashed into the mountain and now they will be trapped Ten coins for a night y'all stay in the night nope
[223:32.55]We're just coming in to save.
[223:40.10]The item shop.
[223:42.76]Come on in.
[223:43.46]Don't be shy.
[223:44.62]Everyone's... Oh, sorry.
[223:45.50]I've got to do it with a southern accent.
[223:46.80]Everyone's up on the mountain.
[223:48.23]But I've stuck mine in the store.
[223:50.19]So what you need?
[223:52.87]There we are.
[223:53.79]Punch glove.
[223:54.39]Finger shot.
[223:55.05]Symbols.
[223:55.65]Everything is so expensive.
[223:56.73]Okay.
[224:03.45]Punch gloves.
[224:04.33]Finger shot.
[224:05.97]Symbols.
[224:07.77]Mega shirt.
[224:10.17]And then work pants are really, really good too.
[224:12.39]Work pants.
[224:14.91]Who's going to wear the work pants?
[224:19.19]Probably Gino.
[224:22.15]Mega shirt, mega pants.
[224:23.19]Gino's going to wear the work pants.
[224:26.81]Let's get a couple of mid-mushrooms, a couple of maple syrups.
[224:34.16]Why didn't I finish Red Dead Redemption 2 on stream?
[224:36.27]Because the game is 150 hours.
[224:37.29]Okay, here we go.
[224:48.80]Punch glove.
[224:49.62]The shell.
[224:52.46]Finger shot.
[224:53.14]I beat the whole thing off stream.
[224:57.83]Mega shirt.
[224:59.46]Mega pants.
[225:01.20]And then work pants.
[225:03.52]Makes you do way more damage.
[225:08.48]I'll give you the wake-up pin too, because you need something.
[225:13.36]How many hours have I streamed Dark Souls?
[225:15.36]Um, I don't know.
[225:17.18]That's a good question.
[225:17.88]I can sell the rest of these.
[225:29.87]Sell items.
[225:30.41]I think it's time to get rid of these mushrooms.
[225:31.77]How much is a Yoshi cookie worth?
[225:34.45]One dollar.
[225:39.87]Damn, these are... 75 cents!
[225:42.09]75... Fuck it.
[225:45.91]Sell them.
[225:48.60]I'm not gonna use those.
[225:53.66]This... That's just... That's good stuff.
[225:56.79]Alright, that's alright.
[225:57.43]I have a lot of honey syrups.
[225:59.49]I'm gonna be replacing these with mid-mushrooms as we go.
[226:01.47]Alright, I've got plenty of money.
[226:03.83]I've got $3.43.
[226:06.93]Yeah, I guess.
[226:08.33]Alright, I've got a full inventory.
[226:17.13]It's an emergency!
[226:17.95]Dinah's trapped in the mines!
[226:34.79]Alright, we're gonna save somebody in the mines.
[226:37.69]A lot of houses.
[226:54.52]My ma and pa are helping out on the mountain.
[227:05.81]Do I have an Instagram?
[227:06.68]I don't have an Instagram.
[227:09.52]I think- I said this like years ago, I said if like anyone ever shows like their balls on Instagram and it's Mon- it's not me.
[227:24.69]It's Bowser.
[227:35.39]Most of our allies have run off.
[227:36.83]What does a Goomba even talk like?
[227:39.35]Bowser, most of our allies have run off.
[227:41.64]What are we going to do?
[227:42.40]We've only had experience fighting Mario.
[227:45.86]These new guys are too much.
[227:48.68]Shut up, all of you.
[227:50.14]I'm the biggest, baddest brood around, and you don't forget it.
[227:53.86]But if Mario hears that I've been kicked out of my own castle, my reputation will be ruined.
[228:00.49]Even I have an image to keep up, you know.
[228:03.03]Let's show them who's the boss around here.
[228:04.90]Alright.
[228:19.97]The mine.
[228:20.63]They're trapped in the mine.
[228:26.41]Everyone's trying to get in.
[228:28.56]Forgetting something over here.
[228:29.70]Let them in.
[228:30.30]I can't.
[228:58.39]Oh, dear.
[228:59.81]I sure hope the kids are okay.
[229:02.82]I know how you're feeling, but moping around here ain't gonna help a thing.
[229:12.68]That's what I've told her.
[229:13.94]But I don't know if I'd be feeling any different if I was her.
[229:17.54]We're getting nowhere fast.
[229:19.06]We'll never reach the kids at this rate.
[229:21.84]See that up there?
[229:22.94]That's the old entrance to the mines.
[229:25.16]But we can't reach it anymore.
[229:27.42]If only that fella, Mario, were here.
[229:30.84]He could reach that in a heartbeat.
[229:34.00]Well, speak of the devil.
[229:37.26]I'll be a goomba's uncle.
[229:38.92]If it ain't him in the flesh.
[229:40.66]Mario, you're a lifesaver.
[229:43.58]Mario, have you heard the news?
[229:45.74]I have.
[229:48.24]Will you rescue the kids?
[229:50.32]Yes.
[229:51.52]Thanks, Mario.
[229:52.26]Well, there's the entrance up there.
[229:54.38]Here, hop on our shoulders.
[230:07.47]There we go.
[230:08.71]It's time.
[230:10.51]To attack.
[230:17.52]These things are hard to, uh, no they're not.
[230:18.74]That was a lie.
[230:21.02]Lucky!
[230:24.84]Oh yeah, that's the one, two, three punch from Mario and symbols.
[230:28.25]The dumbest weapon in the game.
[230:31.91]Ow.
[230:41.31]Lucky means you get to bet.
[230:43.43]Want to double your coins?
[230:44.57]Challenge the system.
[230:46.01]Win big or lose it all.
[230:47.23]I'll do it.
[230:48.21]Where's the Yoshi?
[230:57.83]Mallow loves him.
[231:05.43]Please choose Mallow's next specialization.
[231:18.25]Are you guys actually going to do it?
[231:20.81]You're just... You're going to do the thing?
[231:27.32]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[231:28.30]I'm sorry.
[231:28.84]I just touched my microphone.
[231:30.44]I'm sorry.
[231:32.24]I apologize.
[231:32.88]Well, there you go.
[231:38.80]We're sticking with magic power and magic defense.
[231:45.45]Only.
[231:45.73]Oh god.
[231:50.03]I think there's a star in here.
[231:54.99]See how I dodged that shit?
[231:56.22]Goddammit.
[232:24.20]All these things back here are more dangerous.
[232:30.08]Lucky.
[232:30.46]Oh.
[232:30.60]Crystal...
[232:50.63]Damn it, I always miss these.
[232:52.67]Now.
[232:53.35]Ugh, okay, I got it.
[233:05.00]Why is Malo so bad?
[233:07.78]Uh... Because he's only had points put into magic damage and magic defense.
[233:21.20]Which means he's really, really, really, really good when you do any of his magic attacks.
[233:28.52]Other than that, not really worth having a party.
[233:40.41]One damage?
[233:41.53]Mario has the highest power of the whole group.
[233:44.22]What the fuck?
[233:49.29]This is why Geno just... gotta put him in every party.
[233:52.02]He's the best.
[233:54.01]Alright, I'm going for it.
[233:56.87]I'll do it.
[234:22.86]I'm going with the audience.
[234:33.85]You were right.
[234:34.49]You guys got it.
[234:35.43]Nice work.
[234:37.27]I am pleasantly surprised.
[235:09.93]You knew it was going to happen eventually, Mario.
[235:12.67]Uh-oh.
[235:13.56]Coins!
[235:14.82]Beautiful coins.
[235:15.70]Grab the coins.
[235:17.48]Listen up.
[235:18.06]Let's leave this half-wit Mario here and split.
[235:20.92]Anyone got beef with that?
[235:25.30]Oh, shit.
[235:25.92]He woke up.
[235:27.77]Oh, no.
[235:29.03]He took the coins.
[235:30.01]Chase Croco and get those coins back.
[235:37.21]oh boy it looks like a dead end here but not to worry I've got a bomb and never leave home without one don't stay so close he stole the coins that we won that is kind of what happened and they're off
[236:05.86]Ah!
[236:13.86]Once again- aw lucky.
[236:29.86]Huge overkill but I didn't want to fight it for that one.
[236:35.93]Here we go!
[236:45.64]What do you think?
[236:53.80]That one, there was no stakes on that one.
[236:57.04]You guys could have picked, but where are the stakes?
[236:59.11]There's two coins.
[237:00.69]The last one was like almost 20.
[237:18.54]You got all the flowers and Mario.
[237:20.49]Good.
[237:21.51]Good work.
[237:23.11]We're doing power again.
[237:24.03]Nice, you got the whole bottom row, yeah?
[237:38.82]Catch him!
[237:40.92]Catch him!
[237:44.20]Come here!
[237:50.75]Let's start this off with a bang.
[237:52.55]50.
[237:52.57]48.
[237:56.93]Thank god it missed.
[238:26.86]652.
[238:27.28]Oh, I'm good.
[238:28.10]It's better than... That's just... Oh, he's got the work pants on.
[238:36.70]Right.
[238:48.47]That wasn't very good.
[238:51.67]Not bad.
[239:06.76]Full HP.
[239:07.96]Let's go.
[239:09.98]Miss.
[239:10.52]I need to hydrate.
[239:14.79]I'll take another break in a minute here.
[239:22.35]18.
[239:25.21]Miss again.
[239:26.72]What the hell?
[239:32.53]I'm gonna use some mushrooms, because they're just taking up tons of space, and I want to get rid of them.
[239:39.74]Never mind.
[239:50.11]Drink water, drink now!
[239:51.31]I'm fine, I'm fine!
[239:55.37]Miss again?
[239:55.91]What's with all these misses?
[240:09.22]You want them back?
[240:10.70]You've got to take me down first.
[240:12.46]Uh-oh.
[240:19.32]Right.
[240:19.74]He takes your item.
[240:20.40]All of them.
[240:20.82]Alright.
[240:28.45]We need to heal with Mallow's heal.
[240:34.65]Chomp.
[240:39.89]If I didn't block that, that would have been really, really bad.
[240:41.77]HP ran to yourself.
[240:42.75]You need to stay alive.
[240:43.45]Alright, we're good.
[240:59.07]Another chomp.
[241:03.39]Twelve!
[241:04.14]We're fine.
[241:10.72]So what is the official speedrun on this game?
[241:14.80]What's the- what's the time on it?
[241:23.24]An hour?
[241:24.52]Two hours?
[241:29.53]Ten hours?
[241:31.23]Yo, Genuf!
[241:32.23]Here's your junk!
[241:33.59]I'm outta here.
[241:36.65]Two hours and forty-six minutes, damn it.
[241:39.31]50 coins and 10 experience.
[241:41.89]And Geno has reached level 7.
[241:46.00]Geno's max HP, his attack, his defense, his magic attack.
[241:49.70]You can take a quick look.
[241:52.20]And I'm going to let you guys decide on what you're going to pick.
[241:58.08]There's a glitch where if you pee in the cartridge, it sends you to the... Yep.
[242:01.56]Alright.
[242:03.30]Okay, guys.
[242:03.78]This is important.
[242:08.54]What do you want to do?
[242:19.02]Much harder than I thought it was going to be.
[242:22.22]This is going to have to stay up for a little bit.
[242:37.28]Y'all want different things.
[242:43.49]How do you vote?
[242:44.03]You just have to click the screen with your extension enabled.
[242:59.06]Okay.
[243:00.14]I have to call it.
[243:04.08]Ten.
[243:05.30]Nine.
[243:06.48]Eight.
[243:07.40]Seven.
[243:08.40]Six.
[243:09.56]Five.
[243:10.36]Four.
[243:11.26]Three.
[243:12.19]Two.
[243:13.35]One.
[243:14.27]HP it is.
[243:14.81]You got it.
[243:16.13]Good choice.
[243:17.49]It was a very good choice because it went up by a lot.
[243:26.26]Got the coins back and picked up a bomb, too.
[243:31.12]Hooray.
[243:47.24]We made it.
[243:47.98]We're out.
[243:51.84]Fuck.
[243:55.00]No, come on.
[243:56.98]Okay, we're good.
[244:05.79]That was a low brain move.
[244:13.54]Alright, here we go.
[244:15.48]Where's the secret item?
[244:16.60]I know it.
[244:17.78]Where's the secret?
[244:19.61]Seems like you found something mighty useful.
[244:21.29]My kid's done.
[244:22.01]I might have trapped back there.
[244:22.97]Let's blast through and find him.
[244:25.83]Thanks, Mario.
[244:26.61]Now stand back and let me get things going.
[244:34.79]Let's follow the tracks to the end.
[244:36.53]What the star?
[244:38.15]It's probably in the back.
[244:39.01]Thanks a million, Mario.
[244:41.37]Let's mosey along now.
[244:43.46]Oh, I guess you're right.
[244:44.06]I'd just be a burden on you fellas.
[244:45.48]Well, then I'm counting on you.
[244:46.94]Why can't we have, like, the mole guy?
[244:52.09]Thanks a lot, Mario.
[244:52.93]I guess I'll be going back to tell Ma about everything.
[244:55.75]Up.
[245:12.08]Oh, oh, oh, I forgot it's here.
[245:13.86]Oh, fuck.
[245:15.38]I forgot.
[245:16.32]I thought you had to...
[245:39.38]Damn it.
[245:41.66]I thought you had to buy it through somebody through a fence.
[245:49.05]I'm disappointed.
[245:51.33]That's a lot of coins.
[245:57.00]That's like a hundred coins.
[246:00.80]That's more than a hundred coins.
[246:10.28]Once again, no.
[246:10.78]That's way later in the game, is it?
[246:20.34]I guess it is.
[246:22.49]That was an absolute shitload of coins.
[246:39.82]541 coins.
[246:41.88]Are you kidding me?
[246:44.73]If I had only made it over here.
[246:46.73]Think about that.
[246:47.25]I would have gotten four... Oh, damn it.
[246:52.07]Oh, well.
[246:52.44]Oh, do it again.
[247:09.73]Got that.
[247:11.05]Anything else?
[247:11.65]I think I'm good.
[247:18.05]Get out of here.
[247:19.49]Just one bomb.
[247:24.46]There's a trick to getting the star as many times as you want, so you can overlevel really quickly here.
[247:29.16]A bunch of broken mechanics.
[247:34.54]Bugs.
[247:39.79]I mean like this.
[247:47.23]Good day.
[247:48.71]The name is Nello.
[247:51.14]Punchinello.
[247:53.42]Punchinello?
[247:54.88]Never heard of you.
[247:56.72]They say I'm a hothead, but I'll show them.
[248:00.46]You, you will make me famous.
[248:03.34]So long.
[248:18.36]Dark Shido.
[248:19.38]It actually kind of is Shido, isn't it?
[248:20.84]Huh.
[248:25.90]It's like that.
[248:39.29]Thousand health.
[248:40.25]Yee-haw!
[248:40.91]I see we're already famous!
[248:45.38]Oh yeah, this guy kind of is annoying.
[249:04.28]Is this emulated?
[249:05.16]It is not.
[249:06.10]I mean, I don't know.
[249:07.77]I have no idea.
[249:10.17]Is it emulated?
[249:10.75]It has to be.
[249:12.79]What am I talking about?
[249:15.82]This is the Super Nintendo thing.
[249:19.62]Like that Super Nintendo box with like the classic SNES box.
[249:24.18]Yeah, the SNES mini thing.
[249:35.28]It's on an actual NES, of course it's- of course!
[249:38.08]This is emulated, I don't even know why I thought that for a second.
[249:47.70]I'm going to jail.
[249:51.76]Not bad, not bad.
[249:54.20]Now let's up the ante.
[249:56.84]Bigger bombs.
[250:07.11]How are we doing on health?
[250:11.33]We're okay.
[250:19.80]Just keep up the punching.
[250:20.73]Go ahead and do a thunderbolt.
[250:28.33]Dammit.
[250:30.75]Alright.
[250:34.46]Settle down.
[250:34.94]Have I said a bad word?
[250:43.80]Alright.
[250:45.24]It's clobberin' time!
[250:53.80]I actually am going to use some stuff here, because these things will kill you.
[250:59.18]Ooh, that's not good.
[251:07.14]It's okay.
[251:09.84]Mushroom on Mallow.
[251:17.88]Use the Disney Lawsuit special move?
[251:21.72]What is the Disney Lawsuit move?
[251:27.71]What the hell does that mean?
[251:47.29]He said it's clobbering time.
[251:51.78]That's the thing, right?
[252:01.22]It's clobberin' time!
[252:02.82]Yeah.
[252:03.72]I don't think a thing has said that in any movie.
[252:15.30]I must be dreaming.
[252:16.58]I'm ruined.
[252:18.32]I didn't want to do this, but now I have no choice.
[252:22.16]I think he's bluffing.
[252:26.26]Simmer down, Fluffy.
[252:27.82]I'm not gonna waste this on you.
[252:29.48]Who knows what might happen?
[252:34.20]Take your best shot.
[252:36.90]Enough.
[252:38.36]Got my pride, now you're in for it.
[252:44.75]Huh?
[252:45.15]What the hey?
[252:47.79]Why isn't it working?
[252:56.22]Mario, if this thing explodes, we're history.
[253:02.12]This is a fine mess.
[253:04.44]Let's scram now!
[253:07.36]Yeah.
[253:08.90]Uh-oh.
[253:12.16]It's gonna blow!
[253:24.03]What on Earth was that?
[253:26.96]Well, we won the battle.
[253:28.48]Now I hope we don't lose the war.
[253:30.59]Where are Dinah and the star?
[253:34.73]Oh, there's the star.
[253:41.63]I guess my question's just been answered.
[253:46.68]Come on, Mario, let's go.
[253:47.58]Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[253:51.10]Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[253:56.08]yeah here it comes 39 I'm not 39.
[254:26.02]I hope I told you that was a fucking liar.
[254:33.58]Come on, let's get the show on the road.
[254:42.02]Who told you that?
[254:44.34]I wanna know.
[254:44.72]This... This won't budge.
[254:54.16]Help me.
[254:55.18]Here, give the mine a push.
[255:02.45]Care to read the warning?
[255:03.57]Of course.
[255:05.15]Mine car guidelines.
[255:06.27]Press A or Y to brake.
[255:07.87]Press B to jump.
[255:10.10]Get mushrooms and press X. Okay.
[255:15.98]To accelerate.
[255:17.36]Moorville Safety Board.
[255:21.43]I was gonna burp.
[255:29.61]I wonder what the record on this one is.
[255:30.85]3D.
[255:32.17]Alright, slow down, slow down, slow down!
[255:42.93]Ah, fuck.
[255:44.03]I forgot it's A.
[255:48.93]Okay, we're good.
[255:50.11]Grab that.
[255:52.95]I fucked it up, again.
[255:54.37]Alright, we're good.
[256:04.10]Watch this.
[256:16.06]Nice.
[256:17.76]The record's at minute 57.
[256:18.64]Is it?
[256:20.30]I mean, this is pretty damn good, whatever I'm doing.
[256:37.53]Shit.
[256:55.44]Give me another one.
[257:05.02]This is a flash game?
[257:06.24]I mean, I can see that.
[257:10.21]Ooh, that was close.
[257:21.48]I need another one.
[257:22.52]Quick!
[257:23.32]I gotta beat the record!
[257:24.04]I only have 10 more seconds!
[257:32.75]Nah, I didn't get the record.
[257:43.55]Fuck.
[257:44.85]I tried to slow down.
[257:45.70]Sorry.
[257:49.23]restarted this.
[257:49.95]I'm not gonna get the world record.
[258:04.27]I am going really fast though.
[258:08.17]Let's go!
[258:09.51]Hurry up!
[258:10.59]No, no slow!
[258:13.35]Where's the kid?
[258:13.89]Uh oh, I think I lost the kid on a turn.
[258:20.65]I wonder how those kids are doing.
[258:22.15]I sure wish they'd hurry home.
[258:24.97]Settle down.
[258:26.07]I asked Mario to help out, so I reckon he'll be back.
[258:30.71]I just have this odd feeling that they'll be dropping in at any moment.
[258:41.22]They still gotta use the door like everyone else.
[258:42.88]Ma, settle down.
[258:49.45]We're home.
[258:51.35]Gracious, they really did drop in on us.
[258:54.35]Oh, my poor babies.
[258:55.39]Are you okay?
[258:56.77]Little mite, are you hurt?
[259:00.65]No, we're okay, Ma.
[259:02.85]Isn't that right, mite?
[259:03.83]We had fun.
[259:09.17]Ma, Ma, Papa.
[259:13.43]He's been knocked unconscious.
[259:15.69]You poor baby, you're safe now.
[259:17.95]Donna, haven't I told you often enough to never go into the mines by yourself?
[259:23.33]That's enough, Ma.
[259:24.35]Just be happy to have him back.
[259:26.49]We haven't thanked Mario proper either.
[259:29.45]Thank you, Mario.
[259:30.53]I'm so embarrassed.
[259:32.57]We can't thank you enough for everything.
[259:34.43]What's that, the roof, you say?
[259:35.77]That don't matter, none.
[259:38.11]It ain't nothing at all.
[259:39.35]You just leave any repairs to me.
[259:41.44]Give me a holler if you ever need a hand with your place.
[259:44.26]Thanks again for bringing our babies back to us.
[259:47.42]Oh, and by the way...
[259:49.93]You've found Dinah, Might, and a Star Piece.
[259:52.37]But where is Toadstool?
[259:57.73]Just want to make sure you understand.
[259:59.97]It's me, Luigi.
[260:02.69]I drank a potion and turned into a mole.
[260:19.65]I'm back.
[260:19.93]I have to catch my breath after that one.
[260:29.72]Come back here, Mr. Beetle.
[260:31.38]Don't you want to come to Boosters and play?
[260:33.50]Yeah, don't you run away.
[260:36.08]We just want to play.
[260:37.34]We'll take good care of you.
[260:38.80]Oh, like what they said.
[260:41.35]Okay, Mr. Beetle.
[260:55.55]Don't you dare touch that beetle.
[260:57.55]It's a present for Booster.
[260:59.95]That's right.
[261:00.85]Just hand it over nice and easy.
[261:03.41]Yeah, like they said, or we won't be your friend.
[261:08.46]Booster really, really likes beetles, but he can't catch his own.
[261:12.74]That's right.
[261:13.38]He's busy keeping the princess from the sky entertained.
[261:17.00]Yeah, so we're catching beetles for him.
[261:21.50]So hand it over.
[261:23.00]That's right.
[261:24.36]Oh, please.
[261:27.96]Oh, no, it's getting away.
[261:29.91]Quick, catch it.
[261:31.45]Catch it.
[261:35.97]Bunch of fucking idiots.
[261:47.43]Welcome to my pretend store.
[261:57.46]Would you like a shiny stone?
[262:00.20]Yes.
[262:02.22]If you bring me fireworks, then you'll give me a shiny stone.
[262:05.84]God damn it.
[262:09.75]I can't.
[262:12.98]Hey there, remember me from the mines?
[262:14.28]I found some neat stuff and I'm opening a miner's store.
[262:17.05]Come and take a look.
[262:20.41]Yeah, I never really thought about this.
[262:21.71]Giving fireworks to a child.
[262:25.07]Item one, a lucky jewel.
[262:26.52]It's sure to bring you plenty of good luck.
[262:28.92]I'll sell it to you for a hundred coins.
[262:31.48]I'll take it.
[262:42.50]That's all I got for now.
[262:51.17]Someone's luck at will.
[262:52.69]What is this thing doing?
[262:53.67]This thing sucks.
[263:00.66]In the talk of the town, they say you save the kids.
[263:02.48]So what do you need?
[263:07.54]I need one.
[263:08.66]I don't have... Alright, I need to get rid of stuff.
[263:10.71]I'm gonna start selling stuff.
[263:12.89]Yep, it's time to clean it up.
[263:16.85]I know I'm losing money on this, but I have to free up some room.
[263:19.77]How much is Lucky Jewel?
[263:20.53]50.
[263:20.61]Okay, alright, alright.
[263:37.70]I'm so hungry.
[263:38.28]I sure wish I had a Carbo Cookie.
[263:43.02]I wish I had a Carbo Cookie too.
[263:52.40]What are you guys doing?
[263:54.84]Why is everybody ever doing the dot dot dot?
[263:57.00]There's a rumor that Booster's new girlfriend fell from the sky.
[264:06.02]She's supposed to be pretty too, just like Princess.
[264:10.42]Who would have thought a girl could fall out of the sky?
[264:12.28]Maybe it's Toadstool.
[264:13.54]Nah.
[264:17.50]This hole my wife dug is a shortcut to the trolley.
[264:20.26]It's an amusement ride I named Mowville Mountain.
[264:23.00]Ain't that nifty?
[264:24.68]Drop in here and you'll be right at the trolley tracks.
[264:26.46]It'll only cost you 10 coins.
[264:28.40]The high score is 2 minutes and 32 seconds.
[264:30.87]You wanna ride it?
[264:32.57]No.
[264:36.07]Fine, be that way.
[264:41.19]The record at Mova Mountain is 2 minutes 32.
[264:44.67]Just go to the inn and rest if you're tired.
[264:46.15]Ma and Pa say little ones aren't allowed on the trolley.
[264:52.13]I can't wait to get older.
[264:54.47]Now it's just a ride.
[264:55.31]Alright, let's go.
[265:04.00]Boost or pass?
[265:17.49]What?
[265:25.31]They're alive?
[265:32.61]They are, aren't they?
[265:33.33]Yeah, it's a fish in there.
[265:37.15]I forgot about the fish thing.
[265:46.89]Doesn't even hurt.
[265:49.85]Pre-recorded stream.
[265:50.71]Why are you saying that?
[265:52.20]What the fuck are you talking about?
[266:02.32]It's artichokes.
[266:06.85]How do I know which one is real and which one's fake?
[266:08.79]I don't know.
[266:09.23]I've never played this game before.
[266:10.43]You know what?
[266:14.59]I'm going for him.
[266:17.27]I'm gonna get him.
[266:17.75]I'm gonna take him out of the sky.
[266:22.85]Bingo.
[266:24.03]I knew there was one over here.
[266:27.97]Got him.
[266:28.25]Alright, let's get him.
[266:39.00]This guy knows magic?
[266:40.90]That hurt a lot.
[266:52.31]Six.
[266:53.31]I didn't even know that was here.
[266:54.17]I thought that was part of the background.
[266:55.68]That means someone's gonna die.
[266:59.20]Who's- alright, I have to be careful.
[267:00.60]Why is it- why is it my savior?
[267:09.64]Once again, there it is, finally.
[267:10.98]First time I've seen it.
[267:11.61]This is the worst speedrun I've ever seen.
[267:20.24]I'll... I'm sorry to hear that.
[267:22.74]Alright, I'm really not using items right now.
[267:34.20]I really need to.
[267:35.14]And I'm... He's still alive.
[267:42.27]He's dead now.
[267:43.83]Right?
[267:44.41]Like, that... Okay, this is getting a little ridiculous.
[267:58.09]Stench.
[267:58.57]Ew.
[267:58.75]You have so much HP.
[267:59.99]It's kind of annoying, actually.
[268:07.06]You guys have fucked.
[268:28.11]That's a good way to get rid of all your mushrooms that you don't want.
[268:31.55]Like that.
[268:32.25]Okay.
[268:38.59]Anything else down here?
[268:39.45]Nope.
[268:48.19]Don't touch that one.
[268:48.79]That one's fake.
[268:49.33]Two.
[268:52.11]Three.
[268:57.49]Close them all up.
[268:59.29]You've been sealed.
[269:00.11]Picked up a flower.
[269:12.36]What a god of a gamer.
[269:20.56]Booster Tower.
[269:23.34]This is one of the oddest parts of the game.
[269:28.11]The place is fucking weird.
[269:33.10]Booster has such a nice place.
[269:34.98]I miss my fortress.
[269:37.04]I miss the good old days.
[269:39.06]Toadstool screaming in terror, Mario rushing in to save her.
[269:45.66]Oh, Jesus, Mario.
[269:47.08]Oh, okay, okay.
[269:48.66]Calm down.
[269:49.55]Don't let him see you like this.
[269:51.77]Hey, how you been?
[269:52.75]No, not like that, idiot.
[269:54.47]Wrong tone needs more confidence.
[269:59.71]You!
[270:00.21]What are you doing here?
[270:02.05]If Toadstool were at my castle waiting to be rescued, she'd be crying like a baby!
[270:06.09]What are you doing?
[270:14.89]Oh!
[270:16.42]Did I just hear some voices?
[270:18.36]It couldn't be!
[270:21.08]I can't believe it!
[270:22.18]It's Mario!
[270:25.70]Mario!
[270:27.68]I'm up here!
[270:35.84]That voice.
[270:37.69]It's Toadstool.
[270:39.85]I thought she'd gone away, but she's been stuck here.
[270:46.43]Well, I guess I'll be returning to my castle now.
[270:51.96]Out of my way, shorty.
[271:18.27]It's locked.
[271:23.83]What?
[271:24.87]You're still here?
[271:25.51]That look on your face.
[271:29.08]I get it now.
[271:30.88]Out of my way shorty.
[271:38.95]Yeah, I'm a piece of work, ain't I?
[271:41.29]All this power and looks too, I know, I know what you're thinking.
[271:44.92]A big strong guy like him would be great to have along, right?
[271:48.58]I'm gonna do something I might regret later.
[271:52.12]I'll let you join the Koopa Troop.
[271:54.30]You can thank me later.
[271:56.92]Mario and his friends have joined the Koopa Troop, or so they're pretending.
[272:02.46]Bowser joins the group.
[272:08.60]By the way, for those of you wondering, this is the first game, and one of the only games, where Bowser is a playable character.
[272:22.29]It's the first time they did it.
[272:32.99]And yes, Milo is gone.
[272:45.68]Bowser's inside... Yeah, I said the... I said the... I said one of... It's the first and one of the only.
[272:50.25]I didn't say this is the only time they've ever done it.
[272:51.95]Wave goodbye to Mallow.
[272:54.63]He's gone.
[272:54.93]You'll never see him again.
[272:59.57]What do I want in the middle?
[273:03.11]You can't count Mario Kart.
[273:05.59]That's like saying that Waluigi is like a play... Well, I mean, you know what I'm saying?
[273:11.24]Party games don't count.
[273:13.26]I'm talking like a main, like, Mario video game.
[273:20.74]You can't count a party game.
[273:27.41]I can't, you cannot replace Mario, unfortunately.
[273:30.81]Uh, what do you have for items?
[273:38.59]Nothing.
[273:39.43]Nothing yet.
[273:47.15]Welcome to booster tower Hello there Boosters busy right now, so he can't play Come back some other time or you can try to force your way Right now
[274:34.30]Blizzard.
[274:35.40]It's chilly in here, isn't it?
[274:47.55]I still don't know what Terrorize even does.
[274:49.43]Ah, now I get to stand on your desk.
[275:00.19]Alright, so, uh, let's take a look over here, and over here, and over there.
[275:06.89]There's the Jester.
[275:07.59]We're gonna... Cut in the back.
[275:18.81]Kill the Clown.
[275:19.33]Yeah, I'm going for the Clown.
[275:29.52]First try Jevil.
[275:33.51]Any news on that game?
[275:34.57]Is Undertale, Delta Room, whatever, coming out soon?
[275:37.13]Or is that going to not be a thing for a long time?
[275:49.94]Seven years.
[275:55.17]What?
[275:56.33]I don't even want to fight you.
[276:02.11]Let's go back.
[276:05.58]This is a little fun puzzle.
[276:09.20]I can't do this right now, though.
[276:13.27]I can later.
[276:19.47]Booster the first.
[276:22.10]Booster the second.
[276:23.32]Booster the third.
[276:24.58]Booster the fourth.
[276:25.68]Booster the fifth.

[276:50.84]Booster's voice.
[276:54.13]Well, I want to make rush.
[277:00.65]Ahem.
[277:08.06]I'm Booster, and this is my famous tower of amusement.
[277:12.29]Normally, I welcome visitors to play with me and my sniff-its.
[277:16.79]However, a girl fell out of the sky and into my lap recently.
[277:22.63]Since then, I've been busy keeping her happy and entertained.
[277:26.99]I no longer have the time to play, so please enjoy yourself.
[277:31.73]You're on risk of death.
[277:46.46]Please refrain from bothering booster Holy shit, we did a lot of damage
[278:27.52]Let's heal while I still have a second.
[278:32.83]Mid-boss... I'll take a Honey Syrup, though.
[278:48.98]I love the bass on this one.
[278:53.71]Flower tap.
[278:56.13]He's just hiding.
[279:08.88]Alright, here we go.
[279:11.36]Remember I told you I was gonna have to do this later?
[279:15.85]Got it!
[279:17.21]First try, yeah!
[279:22.49]Found a masher!
[279:32.08]That is a new weapon for Mario.
[279:37.52]It's much better.
[279:40.14]Take a look at that.
[279:41.56]97 versus 77.
[279:45.00]It's ridiculous.
[279:52.90]97 attack now.
[279:54.76]In fact, now that Mario has that item, I'm going to give the work pants to Mario.
[280:02.99]Mario cannot use the work pants.
[280:05.49]Never mind.
[280:05.93]Give Bowser the work pants?
[280:17.92]Well, Geno's got the work pants and he's doing damage.
[280:28.93]Shit.
[280:29.59]Too fast.
[280:32.93]Did you miss Mallow?
[280:34.81]Well, you might see Mallow again.
[280:38.09]Eventually.
[280:48.68]What was that loud noise outside?
[280:50.12]Check out Booster's Pass!
[280:53.10]Yeah, there's a new area, I think.
[280:54.46]Are you guys ready?
[280:59.91]Are you ready?
[281:31.23]Oh no!
[281:32.61]How did they get the rights?
[281:36.15]I can't believe they got the rights to Mario.
[281:49.74]Oh, that thing on the left sucks.
[281:56.80]Doesn't take... It only takes damage from... Um...
[282:01.90]Magic, I think.
[282:03.14]It's a pain in the ass.
[282:05.86]Earwig.
[282:07.22]Well, that was not correct.
[282:08.60]I know that one of them is hard to kill.
[282:19.23]No, go back, back, back, back, back.
[282:20.11]That's the loop that... Oh, nice weather we're having!
[282:28.29]I wanna fight you.
[282:30.43]You wanna fight?
[282:32.15]I do.
[282:56.67]Bash his head.
[282:57.53]Sniffet 3 is the most powerful.
[282:58.87]Because he does static E. All three, uh, Sniffets are dead.
[283:31.01]Save point!
[283:34.67]Dang, Booster's Tower.
[283:37.19]Is this on the SNES?
[283:38.09]Yes, it is.
[283:39.91]Super Nintendo Entertainment System, you can get it from the little SNES MIDI, or... by some other means.
[283:48.18]I don't know how.
[283:51.16]Take a look at Booster's family portraits in order from the oldest to the youngest.
[283:56.02]Alright, can I remember this?
[284:03.96]Fuck.
[284:04.34]I tried to- I was doing- I was going for the one on the right!
[284:12.21]I wanted to go on the right.
[284:20.49]Someone's gonna level up soon here.
[284:22.99]Okay, here we go.
[284:24.93]Then it was... Okay, then I think I patch?
[284:32.27]Then it's a little messy for me here.
[284:33.85]I think then it's sunglasses, and then regular glasses, and then here we are.
[284:39.60]That's me!
[284:41.66]Got the key.
[284:45.59]The elder key.
[285:01.70]They gaze into each other's eyes.
[285:08.25]Mario, she's a bit shy.
[285:09.69]Look the other way, will you?
[285:10.47]You can turn around now.
[285:16.73]She says she's been locked up ever since she took a bite out of Booster.
[285:19.57]So now, she wants to help us Ster up a little trouble.
[285:28.27]Got the chomp.
[285:32.91]New party member unlocked.
[285:35.73]Chomp.
[285:37.15]Now you get to work.
[285:37.91]No you don't.
[285:41.57]Yeah.
[285:42.27]Chomp, work pants, 105 damage.
[285:46.61]Don't have any more armor for Geno, but that's fine.
[285:53.69]How are we doing?
[285:56.89]Ah, could be better.
[286:15.07]I did that in reverse.
[286:17.75]Sorry, I'm an idiot.
[286:22.71]Alright, got the chomp.
[286:28.03]New weapon for Bowser.
[286:31.32]And... here we go.
[286:34.90]I love the architecture of this place.
[286:37.04]It's just really weird and interesting.
[286:44.07]And there's full fire, that's great.
[286:52.78]Alright.
[286:53.74]Up.
[286:53.96]Uh, gotta go across this way.
[286:55.42]Oops.
[286:59.58]It is so weird.
[287:03.09]It is so weird.
[287:09.50]There's a Remocon.
[287:11.36]These things take hundreds of damage.
[287:14.95]That's the other one here in my life.
[287:16.75]The best part of the game is when Mario challenges you to a game of Yahtzee.
[287:23.49]I know what you're talking about.
[287:26.11]That is a pretty interesting part.
[287:35.81]So weird.
[287:36.49]Mid-mushroom.
[287:38.73]Good.
[287:40.39]Let me make these jumps.
[287:45.17]What's up there?
[287:47.23]Something?
[287:50.66]Wait.
[287:52.46]Check over behind there.
[287:53.34]There's always... Yeah.
[287:55.50]A frog cone.
[287:56.10]Got it.
[287:56.52]Nice.
[287:56.80]There's always something.
[288:04.19]Ah, I would have figured.
[288:05.03]I would have figured.
[288:07.57]No, really?
[288:08.21]I would have figured.
[288:36.58]Is Booster Wario's dad, do you think?
[288:41.63]I don't know.
[288:42.67]We'll never know the answer to that question.
[288:44.09]Wario's not in this game, so there's no spoiler.
[289:05.74]I want to get all the frog coins.
[289:09.49]It's important to me.
[289:11.57]Hey!
[289:12.13]Mallow reached level 8 without even doing anything.
[289:14.71]Pretty decent upgrades.
[289:15.71]Go ahead.
[289:16.17]I may as well just pick special every time.
[289:19.29]There's no way anyone's... You're never gonna pick anything else.
[289:22.90]Ever.
[289:39.47]I'm just gonna do special every time, because that's what you're gonna pick.
[289:41.61]So that's what he's doing.
[289:42.69]Ooh, that was two!
[289:43.62]It's from 38 to 40.
[289:44.02]Damn it.
[290:07.50]You know, I still don't know what the mechanic is in this room.
[290:11.89]Since I was 12, I just jump to the ones that are the tan tiles.
[290:20.47]And I think it works.
[290:21.57]That's the mechanic.
[290:29.30]Right.
[290:35.66]W-E-X-P.
[290:36.36]I'm not gonna involve you guys.
[290:41.17]How do I get it wrong every single time?
[290:45.47]Every time.
[290:45.93]Room key.
[290:47.19]What's that?
[290:47.73]Zoom shoes!
[290:48.39]Oh yeah, zoom shoes.
[291:03.83]Hmm.
[291:04.49]Alright, let me take a look here.
[291:07.86]67 Ds.
[291:08.08]Should I just give them to Bowser?
[291:11.68]Speed up by 10.
[291:16.89]Huge magic defense.
[291:19.94]Bowser's kind of unstoppable with these on.
[291:22.86]Yeah.
[291:23.22]Look at the Zoom shoes do it, Bowser.
[291:30.46]Zoomer.
[291:30.89]Ha ha ha.
[291:31.41]Funny.
[291:31.65]It's like the word Zoomer, but it's funny.
[291:33.17]Ha ha, Zoomer.
[291:35.69]I'm so glad that you just said all that and stuff, because I was gonna say, like, here are the zoomer shoots.
[291:39.55]So, like, thank you.
[291:43.51]Thank you for literally doing that before I did, so people won't make fun of me.
[291:46.58]Thank you.
[291:48.36]Alright, we got, uh... Fine.
[292:00.26]I should lob that person?
[292:01.67]Yeah.
[292:08.03]No, what do you mean, yeah?
[292:09.39]No.
[292:11.83]I used to be pretty good at avoiding these.
[292:13.78]This way.
[292:22.00]Bowser's beefed up.
[292:23.46]148 damage.
[292:24.04]The rest of this game is going to be a breeze.
[292:49.45]Why won't you say Bowser is hot?
[292:52.85]Can you time hits to do gaunt?
[292:56.95]Yeah.
[292:57.23]I ain't even gonna answer that one.
[293:25.92]Die!
[293:26.48]What the hell?
[293:27.16]Alright, somebody else level- Mario needs to level up, it's been a while There it is
[293:56.84]Big HP increase.
[293:58.04]Oh, don't do it yet.
[293:59.36]Now do it.
[294:00.10]Now, do it again.
[294:00.86]Stop.
[294:01.00]Try it again.
[294:02.13]I screwed that one up.
[294:04.43]Try it.
[294:38.12]Do I count the fact that Mario and HP are on the same plane?
[294:42.76]They're on the same, like, column?
[294:44.22]That's 39%.
[294:44.44]What do you mean, no?
[294:45.07]That's too bad.
[294:45.69]That's 35%.
[294:46.07]33%, that's it?
[294:46.47]Thanks for voting.
[295:20.03]What about the flowers?
[295:22.47]Those are very, look at that, they're overlapping into each other.
[295:27.88]That bubble is very, now people are panicking.
[295:30.56]Now you're freaking out.
[295:31.42]Those bubbles are overlapping.
[295:33.96]I have to count it.
[295:38.14]Look at this.
[295:42.29]Everybody's lost their damn mind.
[295:54.40]Thanks for voting.
[296:04.99]Chugga-chugga.
[296:09.97]Chugga-chugga.
[296:11.81]This is my personal railway.
[296:15.05]Eh?
[296:15.69]Ah, it's you again.
[296:21.63]I'm amazed you made it this far.
[296:23.69]It's quite amazing you are.
[296:25.75]Since you're here, maybe you can clear something up for me.
[296:29.55]My bride-to-be is chanting, Mario, help me, Mario, help me, Mario, help me.
[296:36.06]Is she showing her happiness?
[296:38.92]Hey, wait a second.
[296:40.48]Maybe Mario is another guy.
[296:44.16]What if you're this Mario she keeps talking about?
[296:48.37]I'm trying to take my bride away while I can take the best of the state.
[296:52.73]That didn't do it?
[296:57.60]I ran out of bombs.
[297:19.65]Not so long.
[297:56.72]That was the joke?
[298:03.11]Well, the joke was I was thinking about leaving that on for an hour.
[298:21.68]I was- that whole time that I was sitting there, I was internally debating if me muting my microphone and going- eating food downstairs.
[298:30.32]Just getting like some like pasta or something and just eating.
[298:34.16]And spend like a full hour down there.
[298:40.40]But then I was like, no, I want to play.
[298:41.90]I want to play this game.
[298:43.06]I want to like continue to go.
[298:50.35]Frog coin.
[298:58.32]How many frog coins do I have?
[298:59.28]Chat would go insane during that hour.
[299:03.30]Yeah, they would.
[299:04.22]No, this is where it gets weird, right?
[299:19.13]This Mario doll.
[299:21.87]Everybody's playing with action figures in this universe, huh?
[299:31.16]Mario!
[299:32.00]You did come to rescue me!
[299:33.30]I was so frightened and lonely!
[299:35.49]But now that you're here... The door won't open?
[299:40.57]I think we need boost or spell to undo the lock on it.
[299:43.37]What should we do?
[299:53.99]What should we do?
[299:54.49]Booster's returning, isn't he?
[299:56.51]I know!
[299:56.87]Hide somewhere and wait until he opens the door!
[299:58.33]You can move freely behind the curtains.
[300:05.47]Good luck hiding from Booster and his snippets.
[300:10.41]I failed this all the time when I was younger.
[300:14.23]This was so hard for me to do.
[300:17.83]Boy, shouldn't we be concentrating on the girl?
[300:22.31]Right!
[300:23.45]How about that girl in my life?
[300:25.21]Who thinks I should marry her?
[300:27.71]Well, speak up.
[300:30.78]A wedding ceremony would make a great party.
[300:34.66]Ah, a party.
[300:36.42]We would have one of those.
[300:37.64]It could be fun.
[300:39.18]So what is a party?
[300:41.88]Well, you drink punch and eat cake, I think.
[300:47.21]Drink punch, eat cake.
[300:49.79]It sounds complicated.
[300:51.98]I don't know if I can muster the energy to do it.
[300:55.04]Let's walk through it once.
[300:56.08]It's a wedding rehearsal time.
[301:00.64]We will now begin the ceremony.
[301:03.31]Walk down the aisle with the... Hey, turn away for a smile.
[301:06.53]Beautiful bride to be.
[301:10.01]Wait.
[301:11.13]Mario always shows up about now to ruin the fun.
[301:14.69]We've got to take that into consideration, you know?
[301:17.46]Someone go and get the Mario doll.
[301:23.48]It isn't here.
[301:26.59]Of course it's here, you lazy slobs.
[301:28.57]Couldn't find water if you were fish.
[301:32.73]It's behind those curtains.
[301:35.87]Number one, you go and look.
[302:04.07]I wouldn't go and lose my Mario doll, you idiots.
[302:08.85]Number two, you go look too.
[302:33.31]It isn't here.
[302:35.93]We can't give up.
[302:36.87]It's gotta be somewhere.
[302:38.77]Number three, it's your turn.
[302:46.27]Wait a minute.
[303:05.44]This is better than a party.
[303:07.82]Look out, because here I come.
[303:12.34]Wait.
[303:13.30]Wait a second.
[303:16.07]It's right up there.
[303:17.17]I found the Mario doll.
[303:22.45]But we're never going to be able to reach it up there.
[303:25.73]Oh, the sorrow.
[303:28.19]What am I going to do?
[303:34.01]I'm about to lose it.
[303:37.05]I can't get that doll.
[303:38.19]There's no way we're gonna be able to get it.
[303:41.61]How are we supposed to do this?
[303:43.77]I can't.
[303:48.93]Goodness, you're so kind.
[303:51.11]Thank you for getting my doll.
[303:54.53]I'd like to reward you.
[303:56.37]Here, take this.
[303:57.31]Got an idiom.
[304:01.53]May happiness follow you wherever you go.
[304:05.46]Alright, enough is enough.
[304:06.60]Cancel the rehearsal.
[304:07.44]We're going on with the show.
[304:11.10]Here's the password.
[304:13.34]Mario.
[304:40.18]I, like, killed my voice in the first, like, two hours of this game.
[304:45.48]Doing some, some fucking, wh- whoever it was.
[304:48.06]I, like, can't even do the booster I want to do.
[304:55.43]Wait!
[304:56.65]You took all the trouble to come here, so stick around!
[305:01.29]Knife guy.
[305:05.65]We got great guy and knife guy.
[305:17.53]Hmm, let's do some Terrorize.
[305:19.83]Snap.
[305:27.05]It worked!
[305:34.16]Ow.
[305:36.10]I didn't block that one.
[305:49.04]That does so much damage.
[305:50.04]It's so good.
[305:56.84]Echo finder.
[305:57.60]I gotta kill the knife guy first.
[306:08.15]I think he's the most dangerous.
[306:19.52]and oh you can't do anything right yeah that's right yes he is carrying a knife how many times did you beat this game uh probably two to three hundred times
[306:53.72]Something like that.
[306:54.38]Give or take maybe one or two.
[307:10.67]But you played at 500.
[307:11.25]Yeah, I haven't... I didn't beat it of those 500 attempts.
[307:15.81]I only beat it 200 times.
[307:26.79]Flour jar.
[307:27.65]And experience.
[307:28.59]Who's it going to be?
[307:29.87]Bowser.
[307:31.75]Good.
[307:31.99]Bowser, Bowser, Bowser.
[307:32.83]Click.
[307:33.05]Click while I go get a water.
[307:34.97]I'll be right back.
[307:36.39]Wait.
[307:38.42]Hold on.
[307:39.00]Don't click yet.
[307:39.58]Okay.
[307:40.02]Now click.
[308:07.52]Okay, well, I just realized, I forgot about something.
[308:09.28]Yes, uh, you guys ruined it.
[308:11.72]Uh, when I see penis time, everyone make a penis, it's penis time.
[308:14.53]Right?
[308:15.39]Now I know I'm gonna pick this, and then I'm gonna go be a bee.
[308:23.17]So, I mean, that's not gonna happen.
[308:26.95]Thank you for voting.
[308:30.65]And we're gonna do power.
[308:31.75]I would agree.
[308:39.09]90 attack power.
[308:42.17]And Geno as well.
[308:43.59]Give you a good look.
[308:49.80]Impossible.
[308:50.56]How did he know?
[308:52.64]Geno boost!
[308:53.18]One of the best abilities in the whole game.
[308:56.76]Alright, now I will be right back after this.
[309:00.61]I'm gonna refill my water.
[309:04.67]I'm gonna, like, eat, like, a snack.
[309:06.13]I wonder what I'm gonna do for a snack.
[309:07.85]Add your power to this.
[309:08.83]Okay.
[309:08.97]People, let's go.
[309:09.75]Thank you.
[309:38.18]30.
[309:38.22]Wow, that's a lot.
[309:39.54]33, 36.
[309:44.38]No, shit, I can't BRB yet.
[309:45.58]I have to do this first.
[309:48.48]You go right into this thing.
[309:49.83]Oh, yeah, with the bugs.
[309:53.77]Please let me go!
[309:54.59]Won't you please?
[309:56.25]Eh.
[309:57.21]Where's my bride-to-be?
[309:59.39]I want to play hide-and-seek, too.
[310:01.59]Yuck, I don't want to play anything with you.
[310:03.43]What a poor sport.
[310:04.48]Well, we really should hurry along.
[310:06.49]Here we cake is waiting for us after we climb this hill.
[310:09.37]Let's go.
[310:10.73]No, I don't want to marry you.
[310:14.43]Help Mario, help me.
[310:15.57]Oh, that's Mario.
[310:18.71]We didn't plan on this.
[310:21.41]Mario, you aren't invited to our wedding.
[310:24.36]Besides, we still have the rehearsal.
[310:26.72]I'll be happy to race you to the wedding hall, but it better not get in my way.
[310:30.86]Ready?
[310:31.84]Let's go.
[310:34.95]This is the Booster Hill track.
[310:36.81]Forget what you do here.
[310:38.23]You can only move left or right and jump.
[310:40.07]You can't go forward or backwards.
[310:41.11]They have a jump on their heads, I think.
[310:46.87]Touch the Sniffits or any of the barrels and you'll fall back.
[310:50.47]Yep.
[310:52.55]But, if you jump on a Sniffit, jump on a barrel with a Sniffit to sprint forward.
[310:58.81]And I believe every time you touch Toadstool, you get a flower tab.
[311:03.61]So it's a pretty big deal.
[311:04.41]Like, this is a really big deal.
[311:07.03]I don't want to screw this up.
[311:11.48]Got one.
[311:11.70]Damn it.
[311:11.90]Come here.
[311:26.06]Shit.
[311:26.92]What?
[311:27.26]Got it.
[311:27.80]Shit.
[311:55.98]I should have peed first.
[311:57.88]I should have peed first.
[311:58.68]This is Hurry Up and Pee, the song.
[312:03.47]This is in my head whenever I have to really pee.
[312:08.17]How am I not getting that?
[312:09.41]What?
[312:09.69]No fucking way!
[312:30.72]Oh no, it's getting... it's getting more intense!
[312:33.54]Come here!
[313:05.31]I've had it.
[313:07.25]You got six flowers.
[313:09.25]Congratulations.
[313:12.34]Okay.
[313:12.50]I have to pee.
[313:14.14]I'll be right back.
[313:26.49]do
[314:37.68]do
[315:37.64]Thank you.
[316:48.66]I have returned.
[316:49.83]Uh, so by the way, I have confirmed that tomorrow... Tomorrow, we will be trying to complete the base game of Terrarium.
[317:14.20]It may or may not be the last Terraria screen.
[317:19.70]Maybe.
[317:22.30]That is the plan.
[317:23.22]Unless something happens.
[317:26.15]I'm gonna beat Vanilla Terraria.
[317:28.75]Maybe.
[317:31.47]If we can do it, maybe.
[317:32.25]Okay.
[317:32.73]I'm just eating cheese right now.
[317:34.71]Don't mind me.
[317:49.57]What kind?
[317:49.93]It's white cheddar.
[317:50.89]One of those little cheese circles.
[317:53.43]They're good.
[317:53.99]Mm-hmm.
[317:54.29]Babybel.
[317:54.85]That's right.
[318:25.56]I'm the best photographer around.
[318:26.88]Would you like a wedding portrait?
[318:28.54]We'll take it.
[318:33.00]Then take a picture?
[318:39.77]I think it's later, actually.
[318:40.67]Alright, let's go.
[318:42.37]Let's do this.
[318:43.03]Every new town has a shop.
[318:45.47]We want to go in there.
[318:51.01]New stuff.
[318:53.95]I'd like to buy some things.
[318:57.13]And we've got Super Hammer.
[318:59.82]Handgun.
[319:01.42]Womp Glove.
[319:03.44]Chomp Shell.
[319:05.02]Happy Shirt, Happy Pants.
[319:06.92]Bee Tub Ring.
[319:10.76]What do I do with this?
[319:13.01]Well, let's get the... Hold on.
[319:18.51]I think the Masher and the Jump Shoes are better.
[319:21.77]The Zoom Shoes, at least.
[319:22.71]Work Pants.
[319:25.58]I don't think many of these are gonna be any good.
[319:27.38]Amulet.
[319:27.94]Great item, bad smell.
[319:30.70]Alright, this thing's crazy.
[319:34.23]I'm gonna give that to Juno.
[319:37.31]Juno needs armor.
[319:40.03]Uh, happy cape.
[319:49.49]Happy shirt.
[319:53.27]This is Mallow, but I'm not using Mallow right now.
[319:56.33]Handgun.
[319:57.09]Super Hammer.
[319:57.87]This is not as good.
[319:59.51]Should I buy the B-Tub Ring?
[320:05.11]I'm not sure I ever used this for anything.
[320:12.45]Every time I play through this game, I just go, What is that?
[320:14.39]And I don't do anything else about it.
[320:21.50]Handgun.
[320:24.10]These punch gloves I can get rid of.
[320:25.54]The mega shirt, get rid of.
[320:27.44]Finger shot, get rid of.
[320:28.55]Wake-up pin, I'm gonna keep just in case I need it.
[320:30.81]You're fine.
[320:45.88]Sell.
[320:53.73]What about mid-mushrooms?
[320:56.25]I have seven of them.
[320:56.99]I'll be fine.
[320:57.59]I'm gonna get another maple syrup, though.
[320:59.21]That should be good.
[321:00.53]Alright, let's go!
[321:01.56]Merry more!
[321:22.29]Oh, I'm so exhausted.
[321:23.35]I heard there's a casino where you can get big bucks.
[321:26.34]But I just can't find the place.
[321:27.70]Does it really exist?
[321:30.44]It does.
[321:31.90]It does, and I can't wait to go.
[321:47.85]Hello, how may I help you?
[321:48.83]It's locked.
[321:57.63]How am I happy today?
[321:58.31]I'd like to buy some things.
[321:59.09]I'd like to rest a while.
[322:00.11]I'd like to rest a while.

[324:03.27]I feel great.
[324:06.32]It's too small for you.
[324:07.20]What do you mean it's too small for you?
[324:09.16]What are you talking about?
[324:34.02]Mario, you're not supposed to take a shower with all your clothes on.
[324:38.24]I want some room service.
[324:47.81]Took you a full two seconds to get in here.
[324:51.51]I'm thirsty.
[324:54.13]Pick me up ten coins.
[324:55.73]Carro Carro Cola.
[324:57.58]I want the Carro Carro Cola.
[325:03.71]He looks like he wants a tip.
[325:04.83]Did I burn my skin?
[325:33.15]Just kidding.
[325:39.64]You want a tip from comp- you didn't do anything!
[325:41.80]Alright, I want a pick-mail.
[325:57.84]How much money am I giving this guy 84 cents
[326:40.80]roast.
[326:42.68]You paid for only one night stay.
[326:44.65]Would you like to stay longer?
[326:46.15]Yes.
[326:50.05]I don't have 200 bucks.
[326:52.23]What happens when I... No, like, honestly, what?
[326:59.77]I don't think I've ever done this.
[327:02.80]Yeah, stay again.

[327:21.65]Three days now.
[327:24.99]Okay, let's go.
[327:26.81]Have I ever done this before?
[327:30.20]Hello, how may I help you?
[327:39.43]Stay more?
[327:44.49]Sir, you seem to have stayed three times for the price of just one night!
[327:50.07]I'll have to receive a hundred coins for each night you have extended your stay.
[327:54.60]Wait a minute, you're broke!
[327:56.58]I have no choice but to make you work for the remaining amount.
[328:07.24]What do I have to do?
[328:14.09]Remember to do a good job.
[328:15.81]Okay, come on.
[328:16.23]This way.
[328:23.83]And then up here.
[328:26.30]Here you are.
[328:26.64]The suite.
[328:42.57]Disappear.
[328:43.11]Disappear.
[328:44.48]There's all those things.
[328:48.38]And, uh... I could use a tip.
[328:52.10]Phew, finally here.
[328:53.04]Hey, you're mighty handy around here.
[328:54.70]You deserve a tip.
[328:55.50]Go on, take it.
[329:04.09]Thank you.
[329:04.49]I just threw it away in front of her.
[329:12.72]Can I sleep in here?
[329:20.38]I'm gonna take a shower.
[329:23.63]In your shower now.
[329:28.65]Oh, come on.
[329:29.25]I can't sleep?
[329:33.85]Alright, I did it.
[329:45.64]Please see our guest out.
[329:48.80]What?
[329:50.18]I slept like a baby, thanks.
[329:53.59]I'm trying to flock her.
[329:54.77]Fuck.
[329:56.85]You are not a guest now.
[329:58.41]Please come here and we shall discuss this matter.
[330:03.07]You're not off the hook yet.
[330:13.38]What's going on?
[330:18.27]What's that what are they gonna complain what's going on?
[330:30.04]Bellhop escort this guest over to our suite.
[330:33.26]Can you please help me out?
[330:37.03]It's the same person
[330:53.84]Finally.

[330:58.22]A mushroom.
[330:58.72]Use the toilet.
[331:00.36]Please see our guest out.
[331:01.80]God damn it, totem.
[331:03.54]I'm trying to fucking stand here.
[331:27.31]Good job.
[331:27.95]Now don't you ever spend another night here without any money.
[331:30.67]Hello?
[331:57.82]Well, that was weird.
[332:02.06]Hi.
[332:02.42]What was the last thing you heard me say?
[332:09.07]I feel like I was gone for a while.
[332:10.29]Isn't this just splendid?
[332:19.55]This place is heaven even for the rich and famous.
[332:25.97]You went back up to the hotel room.
[332:27.29]Oh.
[332:28.27]Alright, well, hi.
[332:28.91]We're back.
[332:32.26]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[332:33.14]Hope you're having a good day.
[332:34.96]Hope you're having a good day.
[332:37.44]Lovely wedding hall in a four-star hotel.
[332:38.94]Please enjoy your stay here.
[332:40.18]What?
[332:40.40]You're seeking the man with the face of a totem pole?
[332:42.64]How could I forget him?
[332:43.26]He's up there at the wedding hall.
[332:44.38]Oh, right.
[332:45.82]Stop the wedding.
[332:47.12]Ah, shit.
[332:47.42]The wedding already happened, like, four days ago.
[332:49.68]Oops.
[332:59.67]I'm coming.
[333:00.24]I'm coming.
[333:04.52]Looks like he needs to go somewhere fast.
[333:06.56]Help!
[333:09.74]Booster's wedding is in progress.
[333:17.56]We've barricaded the door, so don't even bother trying to sneak inside.
[333:24.85]What the heck?
[333:27.47]Who's the guy with the totem pole for a face?
[333:29.93]He and Princess Toaster were... No, don't tell me they're getting married.
[333:36.76]I'm not letting you in here.
[333:38.20]And you can forget about the back entrance.
[333:40.22]It's locked.
[333:42.00]At least I think it is.
[333:55.24]Now that's the kind of adorable video game that I love.
[333:58.48]Here's the cake.
[334:09.58]Chef Tort.
[334:12.14]We bake a cake for ze big wedding.
[334:14.78]It must be masterpiece.
[334:18.72]Yeah, the groom-to-be ordered something special.
[334:21.88]Wait until he sees this.
[334:26.51]Can I just jump up there?
[334:32.35]Need a speedrun strat.
[334:33.03]I'm just checking.
[334:35.57]Check everything.
[334:38.77]That- What are you doing?
[334:41.58]Oh, that's nice.
[334:42.42]You stepped on t- You fools!
[334:52.28]Halt!
[334:52.82]Who goes in there?
[334:55.38]You look like Mario, but the door's shut tight.
[334:58.94]Listen, Mustache.
[335:00.32]You and your overgrown turtle friend can take a hike.
[335:03.52]Go scat.
[335:05.22]Make like Mario and jump out of here.
[335:07.46]Get lost.
[335:11.68]It's me.
[335:13.56]Oh, oops.
[335:14.30]We got a problem.
[335:16.14]I better go tell Booster.
[335:18.48]No.
[335:20.28]Ow.
[335:23.28]and we'll bunch.
[335:25.68]Say, you wanna help me bust this door down?
[335:29.04]On the count of three, we'll run together.
[335:31.60]Timing's the key.
[335:35.06]Ready, here we go.
[335:42.44]First try.
[335:47.88]Mr. Sir, Mario's here.
[335:51.96]You crowds!
[335:53.42]You don't break a door down with any... Shut it!
[335:57.20]Shut it!
[335:57.58]Shut it!
[335:57.98]Shut it!
[335:59.68]Mario!
[336:00.64]Is that you, Mario?
[336:01.84]I'm in here!
[336:03.78]Hurry!
[336:04.15]I'm scared!
[336:18.04]We're pretty sure Mr. Mustache can't break in here, but that turtle looks pretty mean.
[336:23.36]He could be trouble.
[336:26.68]They have no idea what they're up against.
[336:29.88]I'm lightning in a bottle.
[336:31.08]I'm an earthquake in a can.
[336:32.32]I'll bust this open in no time.
[336:46.86]I did it.
[336:48.90]Ow!
[336:49.14]Watch what you're doing!
[336:50.92]Great.
[336:54.02]Now I've dropped my shoes, my ring, my brooch, and my crown.
[336:58.43]He's T-posing, by the way.
[337:01.51]I don't think everyone noticed that.
[337:04.73]Booster, sir!
[337:05.59]Uh, Booster, I, uh...
[337:12.59]Don't bother me now.
[337:14.69]Okay, everyone, the bride is growing impatient.
[337:17.75]Let the wedding begin.
[337:20.37]What's this?
[337:21.79]Water coming from your eyes.
[337:24.13]Are you reeking, my dear?
[337:28.26]Ah, this tastes salty.
[337:32.40]Poster, sir, I believe that the bride may be crying.
[337:38.22]Crying?
[337:38.80]Well, that's what people do when they're sad.
[337:42.87]How disgusting.
[337:43.87]This stuff must be corrosive.
[337:46.25]It tastes like the sea.
[337:48.51]What could be making her cry, anyway?
[337:52.43]I believe she's crying because she has dropped some of her wedding gear.
[337:57.42]Ah, of course.
[337:58.64]She dropped her gear.
[338:00.40]Well, those tears will ruin the cake, make or stop, before Mario breaks in.
[338:07.84]Ah, but Mario's already in!
[338:13.23]Booster, sir, hurry and find her things.
[338:14.93]We have to get on with the wedding.
[338:16.49]In the meantime, perhaps we could do something about the cake.
[338:19.01]10-4, good buddy.
[338:22.13]You find her stuff.
[338:23.43]I'll move the ceremony forward.
[338:25.35]Hurry!
[338:29.08]Booster, sir, you're supposed to be on the right.
[338:32.02]The bride should be on your left.
[338:34.92]Just testing you.
[338:39.54]Booster, sir, I found the ring!
[338:44.88]Booster, here's the branch.
[338:48.78]Booster, sir, I found the shoes.
[338:52.23]Hey, wait.
[338:53.45]Wasn't there one more thing?
[338:56.63]Oh, you're right, the crown.
[338:58.97]Hurry and get all the accessories from the Sniffits and save Princess Toadstool.
[339:05.54]If you're quick, something good might happen.
[339:11.78]Maybe you'll get to see a sneak peek of the carnival.
[339:16.96]Ho ho!
[339:17.70]I'll look for the last one!
[339:18.54]Give this to Booster!
[339:20.42]Got the brooch.
[339:22.90]You're jumping to... You're the same person.
[339:28.42]I'll look for the last one!
[339:29.16]Go give this to Booster!
[339:29.94]I'll look for the last one!
[339:35.57]Give this to Booster!
[339:37.75]Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go!
[339:40.59]Crown!
[339:44.41]Oh, here it is!
[339:46.24]Hey, you're Mario.
[339:48.79]So you've come to crash my wedding, I presume.
[339:52.97]Mario, you're finally here.
[340:01.30]Shriek, what is Bowser doing here?
[340:05.08]What a waste of time.
[340:06.82]I got bigger fish to fry.
[340:10.24]You know, when Bowser and, um, and Boomer are in the same room.
[340:18.18]Kinda have to change it a little.
[340:20.54]I know I'm in good hands when you're around, Mario.
[340:22.70]Here's a kiss from my hero.
[340:26.94]Oh, isn't that just great?
[340:28.66]You're gonna kiss him when I'm the one who saved your skin.
[340:32.46]Me too, I want a reward.
[340:34.65]I'll take the kiss, give me a kiss.
[340:37.27]Stop it, all of you idiots.
[340:39.68]Mario, let's start with you.
[340:43.04]That wasn't fast enough.
[341:02.82]So now Toadstool and I are allies.
[341:05.42]I'll never live this down.
[341:08.54]What the?
[341:10.80]I love how he turned over and just was like, ha!
[341:14.99]Now that's one for the scrapbook.
[341:17.35]Come, Mario, let's get back to Mushroom Kingdom.
[341:19.89]The Chancellor's waiting pose.
[341:28.21]Sorry to have kept you waiting.
[341:34.72]We've made the most amazing cake.
[341:36.66]You won't believe it.
[341:39.29]Stop, stop, stop!
[342:09.06]Cake time.
[342:19.84]Zero.
[342:23.40]Go for the cake!
[342:26.31]Attack the cake!
[342:31.49]Kill the chefs, what?
[342:33.59]Stop, stop!
[342:37.15]Stop, stop!
[343:06.63]What are you doing chef toward the cake is moving That is not moving back to work I know it was moving I
[343:39.38]Ow, what is this?
[343:41.74]Now what?
[343:43.46]Chef Todd, the cake is moving.
[343:47.66]Talk no more of this.
[343:50.16]No, really, truly.
[343:51.76]Why would I lie?
[343:54.10]Because you are idiot.
[343:58.23]See?
[343:59.17]It is not moving.
[344:04.59]Oh.
[344:04.83]Oh, the cake's alive.
[344:06.39]Run.
[344:10.50]See, I was right!
[344:11.38]I don't know why the R rolls there.
[344:19.70]By the way, um... That sound that I made.
[344:24.27]I heard it, and then I saw it, and then I saw it again.
[344:26.93]That's the... when you hit with, uh... Undertale.
[344:30.27]That's the flower in Undertale.
[344:33.53]I'm gonna give spoilers for Undertale.
[344:37.49]So, just fucking, just don't listen to this for a second.
[344:41.84]There's a certain noise that that flower makes when you are doing, when something happens.
[344:50.06]Oh!
[344:50.32]It's, you just rewind that and listen to it.
[344:52.35]You don't know exactly what I'm talking about.
[344:53.87]Blow the candles out, here we go.
[344:56.89]I can't speak up because it's a spoiler for the game, and I don't want to spoil the game.
[344:59.51]What if you've never seen it before, you've never played it before?
[345:08.81]Alright, this guy actually sucks.
[345:10.03]I have to be careful here.
[345:12.05]Yeah, this actually is kinda hard.
[345:12.97]I have to- I- yeah, I'm gonna die.
[345:15.41]When was the last time I saved a game?
[345:27.98]Two hours ago.
[345:28.90]That's not true.
[345:41.97]He's got all the spells in the game.
[345:46.69]Have I saved all stream?
[345:47.71]I don't know how.
[345:51.35]Fuck.
[345:52.63]Yeah, that's bad.
[346:09.57]Attack up.
[346:10.03]Defense up.
[346:11.55]And let's super jump on this cake.
[346:25.84]Jump on cake.
[346:26.50]Let's do it.
[346:30.92]Uh-oh.
[346:33.54]First to go down.
[346:34.70]I have to pay attention.
[346:35.56]This is no more messing around.
[346:45.36]Uh, how many midbushes?
[346:51.48]How much longer am I gonna stream for?
[346:52.56]I'm probably going to call it a night after this town.
[346:58.50]That'll take us to cleanly just about like six over six hours.
[347:04.93]Six and a half hours, something like that.
[347:15.77]How far am I through the game?
[347:17.09]I am probably just at the... uh... probably just about the halfway point.
[347:24.53]Maybe another hour or two to get to, like, the halfway point?
[347:29.35]Alright, don't die.
[347:31.55]Mushroom, Mario.
[347:39.78]What does POG stand for?
[347:42.02]Um... yeah, PogChamp.
[347:43.74]It's an emote on Twitch.
[347:50.04]You're gonna stop playing your favorite game at 6 hours, but you're gonna play The Simpsons for 12.
[347:54.10]Yeah, but the difference between The Simpsons for me is I've never seen it before.
[348:01.34]Do you know what I mean?
[348:09.16]No.
[348:10.98]Plus, that was a mission.
[348:13.28]I was... I was on a full, complete mission.
[348:21.27]I love this game.
[348:21.85]This is like when I'm, you know, dead.
[348:26.78]I'm not on like a crazed mission to beat this game.
[348:42.19]Thank goodness.
[348:43.77]Alright, got the first part of the cake now.
[348:56.91]Is this a better game than Bloodborne?
[348:59.51]Uh... I don't think that's fair.
[349:03.76]Because, is this a better video game than Bloodborne?
[349:07.08]Probably not.
[349:10.56]But, it was, maybe, 20 years ago.
[349:19.35]It's hard to compare, is this better than this, even though this is 20 years older.
[349:25.02]They're both very, very, very good.
[349:26.92]One of them just happens to have 20 years of technology on the other one.
[349:35.91]Alright, I need to... I might need to take one of these froggy drinks.
[349:51.09]Was it 30 HP for everybody?
[349:53.23]Yeah.
[349:54.22]I'm going for it.
[350:00.78]Freebie!
[350:16.90]Good.
[350:17.25]140.
[350:17.29]That's pretty damn good.
[350:18.11]There we go!
[350:18.89]Alright.
[350:20.41]Oh, maybe we ought to wait.
[350:24.97]This is Booster's wedding cake.
[350:29.00]It'll have a fist!
[350:30.64]And sweet nibble on it!
[350:31.68]Hey.
[350:36.20]Hey, number one.
[350:37.68]Where's my cake?
[350:40.14]Mr. Uh, sir, there's a 70% chance the object that you're standing on is a cake.
[350:46.34]Is it at all?
[350:48.30]This thing is a cake?
[350:51.58]Okay, everyone.
[350:52.96]Here's the stuffer.
[350:54.82]How do we eat this?
[350:57.31]I say we boil it.
[350:59.53]Number two, what do you say?
[351:01.63]Oh, way too messy.
[351:02.99]Why don't you just swallow it?
[351:05.00]What?
[351:05.36]In one gulp?
[351:06.92]That's easier said than done.
[351:10.34]Come on, booster.
[351:11.60]You can do it.
[351:12.92]Open wide.
[351:16.18]My nerves are shot.
[351:17.88]I feel like I've forgotten to tie my cord before a bungee jump.
[351:22.37]Here it comes.
[351:25.23]Wait.
[351:26.65]Wait.
[351:27.33]Wait.
[351:28.07]What?
[351:29.64]Did the cake just move?
[351:32.20]Concentrate, sir.
[351:34.44]This doesn't feel right.
[351:44.90]It's so delicious.
[351:46.82]It's so good it makes me want to cry.
[351:50.16]Congratulations, sir.
[351:51.74]The wedding is now officially over.
[351:54.60]Thanks, everyone.
[351:57.28]It's a wrap.
[351:57.78]Let's go.
[352:03.35]I don't know, but when I was younger, that was one of my favorite things.
[352:05.21]They jump over you as they leave.
[352:07.58]It just was so... Like, why?
[352:17.42]That was wonderful, Mario!
[352:18.56]You're my knight in shining armor.
[352:21.12]Finally, let's get back.
[352:24.12]Oh, what a day.
[352:25.74]Can you believe it?
[352:26.44]I almost got married to that thing.
[352:28.98]But I hope someone marries me someday.
[352:33.57]Toadstool, Princess of Usher Kingdom, has joined the party.
[352:37.27]Be sure to bring her back safely.
[352:46.73]Oh, sorry.
[352:52.41]Wrong game.
[352:53.23]I'm thinking of Chrono Trigger.
[352:55.74]You play the organ and the fucking thing opens up.
[352:57.64]Right.
[352:57.88]Wrong also awesome best video game ever.
[353:01.04]Forgot.
[353:15.54]Colonel Cross is better?
[353:17.48]Uh, that's debatable.
[353:18.85]It is.
[353:20.05]I would tend to disagree.
[353:21.37]Although there's way more characters in Colonel Cross.
[353:25.19]The creepy guy just left.
[353:26.09]Does that mean we can go on with our wedding?
[353:29.97]Oh, Raz, I'm so happy.
[353:31.03]Let's get this wedding over with so we can stay in the suite.
[353:33.49]And then go on our honeymoon.
[353:35.53]Let's do it.
[353:37.35]Oh, right.
[353:37.79]You'll have to excuse us.
[353:39.29]Time to get married.
[353:41.35]Okay, everyone, we're going to start this from the beginning.
[353:45.33]Back inside, please.
[353:46.49]I'm supposed to officiate this wedding.
[353:50.69]I forgot.
[353:51.67]That's it.
[354:07.98]Good luck.
[354:10.36]I wish you both the best.
[354:11.32]Alright, isn't there like another thing to do here?
[354:20.24]Oh, here we go.
[354:21.94]This is it.
[354:24.82]Okay, get a little closer.
[354:26.14]Ready?
[354:26.78]One... Two... Hey, you!
[354:31.09]Why the long face?
[354:31.85]This isn't a funeral, you know.
[354:33.87]Alright, I'll only count to three.
[354:35.11]Say...
[354:41.06]Did you get it?
[354:43.86]Did you get it?
[354:47.71]You got it.
[354:50.39]Very cool.
[354:51.63]What is it?
[354:52.39]Lip smack?
[355:06.86]Like, for instance, when you... Hang on, I'll turn this... You get to turn the audio up too, you know what I'm saying?
[355:28.05]It's like this.
[355:30.06]Alright, let's get back to Mushroom Kingdom.
[355:37.61]Although, see how we're kind of at the halfway point?
[355:39.56]There's another whole side of the overworld there, but we still have a little way to go.
[355:47.30]Am I going to do a Mario RPG tomorrow?
[355:50.60]Tomorrow the plan is Terraria.
[356:03.08]And depending on how long we do that, I may... maybe we'll just transition back to play this.
[356:14.29]Let's say we play Terraria for like three, four, five hours, and we're like, alright, that's it.
[356:19.75]Maybe I'll hop back on this for another hour or two or something.
[356:24.58]And you get into the word problems part of the game with no walkthroughs.
[356:32.71]Word problems?
[356:33.33]What do you mean, word problem?
[356:34.35]I don't know what you mean Mario, welcome back!
[356:41.55]You look like you're in one piece!
[356:45.39]Princess!
[356:47.73]I'm finally home and with Mario And some wonderful new friends, they saved my life Let's go find the Chancellor!
[356:57.50]We don't How about Mario, we mustn't keep the Chancellor away
[357:05.49]Oh, I know what you're talking about.
[357:09.81]Holy shit, I forgot about that.
[357:12.29]That's hell.
[357:13.64]That area is actual living fucking hell.
[357:19.70]I love that area.
[357:22.22]That's the hardest part of the whole game.
[357:24.04]That's the only game that actually... That's the only part of the game that's a real true challenge.
[357:28.30]Besides...
[357:30.44]Maybe the ship.
[357:32.30]And then the last few encounters.
[357:40.51]That is hard.
[357:42.15]Very hard.
[357:46.39]Chancellor, the princess is back.
[357:51.04]Thank goodness.
[357:52.72]This has been a true nightmare.
[357:55.72]I'm a nervous wreck.
[357:58.02]I know I've worried everyone.
[358:01.06]But I'm fine.
[358:01.68]I can take care of myself.
[358:03.00]With a little help from Mario.
[358:07.08]Come, everyone.
[358:07.98]Let's get out of this drafty door.
[358:15.70]Mario, I hope you know how thankful we are.
[358:19.05]But you must tell me one thing.
[358:20.61]How on Earth can you trust Bowser?
[358:23.47]Trust Bowser?
[358:25.31]What are you talking about?
[358:29.61]Mario, what are you doing with... What is going on here?
[358:39.63]Big cats!
[358:41.73]Chancellor, listen, everyone relax.
[358:43.07]Mario's got things under control.
[358:44.35]Mario, you brought Bowser into the one place where all of his enemies are.
[358:54.26]Yes, yes, I see.
[358:57.10]Bowser, perhaps it's time you told us your story.
[359:00.22]What exactly did you mean when you said you had bigger fish to fry?
[359:03.96]Can't tell him the truth.
[359:07.48]If this gets out, I'm finished.
[359:17.44]Excuse me, sir.
[359:18.68]Perhaps I can set the stage, and the others can add their comments along the way.
[359:24.60]The Princess, Bowser, and Mario were thrown in different directions after a terrible explosion.
[359:29.50]Something huge crashed through the Star Road high above Bowser's place and... ...went... ...KABOOM.
[359:39.66]Where the fuck did Mario go?
[359:49.31]It was a gigantic sword.
[359:51.21]Now Bowser's keep has been taken over by monsters to work for some creep named Schmicky.
[359:57.17]They've thrown me out on my own.
[359:59.07]I mean, I decided to take a vacation.
[360:02.67]They can't do this to me.
[360:04.63]They can't do this to me.
[360:07.34]Anyway, I was working on a plan to get my house back.
[360:10.76]Mario walked up to me and begged me to let him join the Koopa troop.
[360:15.70]I had no choice but to let him in.
[360:17.52]It was pathetic.
[360:19.83]That's not what happened.
[360:20.89]No.
[360:22.45]It's okay, Mario.
[360:23.31]We know Bowser's stretching the truth a little.
[360:26.72]And Mallow, how about you?
[360:28.68]Why are you traveling with Mario?
[360:32.40]Well, because Mario is helping me find my real home and my parents.
[360:36.60]That's why we're on the road together.
[360:40.18]What?
[360:41.27]This is dreadful news.
[360:42.39]Awful horrible.
[360:43.15]I hope you find your real parents soon.
[360:47.33]And, um, Gino, was it?
[360:49.87]Why are you and Mario...
[360:52.95]The Star Road has been destroyed.
[360:55.59]I'm here to fix it.
[360:57.45]Mario is helping me search for the Star Pieces.
[361:00.69]I need them to rebuild the road.
[361:04.28]Star Pieces?
[361:08.22]The Star Road grants our wishes.
[361:10.48]Unless we find all the Star Pieces and fix the Star Road, we can kiss our dreams goodbye.
[361:16.50]What?
[361:17.02]This is dreadful news.
[361:17.90]Horrible.
[361:19.65]Isn't it?
[361:22.78]Indeed.
[361:24.74]For example, say Bowser kidnapped you.
[361:28.48]Without the aid of the Star Road, you'd probably never be rescued.
[361:34.32]Actually, that sounds pretty good to me.
[361:36.74]Let's just forget about all these Star things.
[361:40.30]Ah, great, Bowser.
[361:40.96]Then you can just kiss your precious keep goodbye.
[361:44.92]Hey, what?
[361:45.56]Ah, let's see.
[361:49.25]Mario can't find stars.
[361:50.85]Most of them will be mine.
[361:53.55]But I won't get my keep back unless Mario finds a star.
[361:56.39]So if I want my keep back, I need a star.
[361:58.69]Run that past me one more time.
[362:02.52]Just ignore that idiot.
[362:05.92]I just don't think I could take a world without wishes.
[362:08.34]We need to go and find those star pieces now.
[362:13.76]Princess.
[362:15.68]You can't be serious.
[362:16.58]You're not thinking of joining them, are you?
[362:20.47]This is sheer madness.
[362:21.39]You're a princess.
[362:23.01]What will people say?
[362:23.87]I don't care.
[362:26.43]Things seem so hopeless right now.
[362:29.25]I'm tired.
[362:30.17]I think I need to go lie down in my room for a while.
[362:35.77]Mario, Mallow, Gino, and Bowser.
[362:40.00]You too.
[362:42.42]Good luck.
[362:45.62]Wait.
[362:46.66]That's a fucking Mario thing.
[362:48.58]Now then.
[362:51.28]Thanks to Mario, the princess is back.
[362:53.00]I now declare this date to be known forever as... Hey, wait a minute.
[362:57.96]You don't suppose... Could it have been this Smithy who attacked our kingdom?
[363:02.72]I fear we have no cause to rejoice.
[363:04.18]In fact, Mario, we must ask you for yet another favor.
[363:08.59]Please, on behalf of all of us, you must defeat Smithy.
[363:11.83]It is the only way we shall ever live in peace again.
[363:18.40]Princess Toadstool is home, safe, but she has decided to stay with him.
[363:23.79]But, sorry guys, it ain't gonna be like that.
[363:54.19]Please, Mario, take me along with you, please!
[363:56.07]Don't worry.
[363:57.81]Grandma helped me through this one, so no one will ever notice that I'm gone.
[364:02.75]Let's find us a star.
[364:04.33]Hmm.
[364:05.23]But I wonder where it could be.
[364:06.13]I have absolutely no idea.
[364:07.47]Do you?
[364:08.97]Mario.
[364:10.85]I times like these.
[364:15.53]What should we do?
[364:18.00]We should ask Grandpa.
[364:19.96]My grandpa should know.
[364:22.14]Okay, then.
[364:22.78]Let's do it.
[364:26.36]Just as I thought.
[364:26.92]Toadstool joins the party once again.
[364:34.53]You want to go see how Toadstool is pretending to be still here? ...
[364:52.73]Grandma, thanks for putting up with all my selfish demands.
[364:55.77]Don't worry, Princess.
[364:58.73]A little invincible, do you?
[365:00.75]See the world and make some friends.
[365:03.03]Help destroy Smitty.
[365:07.23]Just make sure nobody looks at my face.
[365:10.42]Mario's beside me.
[365:11.24]Everything's going to be alright, so don't worry.
[365:13.88]You take care, Grandma.
[365:14.70]Are you here?
[365:19.26]I feel like I'm growing younger just talking with you people.
[365:25.71]I thought- you thought that was a cigar?
[365:36.31]That's fucked up.
[365:39.99]Alright.
[365:43.33]I did- I've already found the question mark.
[365:45.25]I did.
[365:45.53]I'm gonna save it.
[365:47.17]I think this is a pretty good stopping point.
[365:57.95]Boink.
[365:58.19]We're gonna hang out and do the bits and the subs and stuff.
[366:05.78]How long is the game?
[366:06.66]Probably another... Another full stream.
[366:11.66]We'll probably do it.
[366:13.64]There's probably like another seven-ish hours in the game.
[366:16.28]Six to seven hours.
[366:18.93]Something like that.
[366:20.05]Maybe a little bit more.
[366:21.15]Depending.
[366:26.03]But yeah, I love this game.
[366:33.84]I hope if you've never played it before, then you get to see and enjoy it too.
[366:37.16]And those of you that have played it before, remember how much fun it was.
[366:44.62]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[366:45.41]We're gonna mess this score up again.
[366:53.27]But there are a lot of little Easter eggs that we have not even seen yet, so we'll probably see those.
[366:57.70]Well, depending on how long we go tomorrow.
[367:08.07]This felt like a video gameplay.
[367:09.65]It was awesome.
[367:11.53]Yeah, sometimes... I mean, obviously I was doing, like, voices and stuff, but... It's fun just to hang out.
[367:23.53]Very comfy, for real.
[367:26.19]But I will see you guys tomorrow.
[367:28.25]We'll keep going.
[367:31.15]After Terraria, maybe I'll jump back on here for, like, another couple hours.
[367:38.88]depending on how it goes but that's where we're gonna end thank you for watching as always let's get the bits open and go back a little earlier today here we are see you tomorrow if you're coming back
[368:09.44]Or see you next time.
[368:11.42]Whenever you decide to join us again.
[368:18.42]And thank you to Gnarly for the $2.50.
[368:19.92]$2.50.
[368:20.04]I had this really weird dream last night.
[368:26.38]You were streaming Minecraft in the middle of the day with a bunch of mods installed.
[368:30.60]There were no jokes, gaffs, or even gaffs.
[368:35.39]Or even commentary from you.
[368:37.93]You kind of just kept quiet, occasionally mumbling to yourself.
[368:41.97]You seemed mad.
[368:43.89]At one point, there was a jump scare, and instead of reacting with a scream or a laugh, you just sighed and muttered, God damn it, under your breath.
[368:52.64]I wonder if you were even aware you were streaming.
[368:57.28]Ha ha ha ha.
[369:00.10]Ha ha ha ha.
[369:04.28]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[369:08.68]I will never, I don't think ever, have an accidental stream.
[369:15.02]I go through so many rituals before I press the start streaming button.
[369:20.67]There's no, it would be impossible.
[369:31.02]What do you mean rituals?
[369:32.72]I just have like rituals, like routines that I do before I start.
[369:41.97]Yeah, I mean, Chrono Trigger is one of them.
[369:52.38]After the next stream or two of Mario RPG, I could do that next.
[369:58.48]That's also one of those just, you know, greatest game of all time type stuff.
[370:07.73]Yeah, maybe.
[370:08.35]If people like this and people think this is a fun stream and a relaxing, chill stream, I think it is.
[370:15.57]It's kind of up to you guys.
[370:19.11]But it seems like this was fun for a lot of people tonight.
[370:22.57]I mean, I kind of was testing the waters tonight, so we'll see.
[370:31.23]But thank you to... We also had...
[370:38.37]Did... Lecronda gave $50 before I was live?
[370:46.16]Yeah, Lecronda gave 5,000 bits before I turned the stream on.
[370:50.78]Holy shit.
[370:53.26]They say, I go, why isn't Dermastreaming yet late streamer and you go live?
[370:57.29]What kind of witch are you?
[371:03.93]That's $50 pre-stream bits and I didn't even know it happened.
[371:10.05]Lacrondor, if you're still here, thank you.
[371:12.53]That's a lot.
[371:15.32]Really appreciate it.
[371:21.80]50 bucks.
[371:24.36]It's time for Slime Thanks to Three Dolls.
[371:26.40]Did you know Super Mario was originally going to be called Superb Mario until Miyamoto convinced Nintendo that they should drop the B from the title?
[371:38.91]Really?
[371:40.80]Is it gonna be Superb Mario?
[371:46.24]Miyamoto convinced President of Nintendo to drop the beat.
[371:51.88]Is this... is this bullsh- this might be bull- this is bullshit, isn't it?
[371:55.74]Superb?
[371:56.26]No, I'm getting- is it?
[371:57.76]I mean, it sounds like it could be.
[372:00.64]I don't know, though.
[372:04.58]You would adore Bowser's Inside Story?
[372:06.29]It has the same kind of goofy charm?
[372:09.82]No random encounters.
[372:12.18]That sounds cool.
[372:13.64]Why would they make that up?
[372:14.57]I don't know.
[372:14.99]I guess it's real.
[372:18.67]That's cool.
[372:19.17]I was much more relaxed today.
[372:23.23]Look at the stream title.
[372:34.81]Hey, smelly boy, thanks for the 250.
[372:36.47]Like, 15 minutes in and you're still in Let's Player mode.
[372:40.10]What?
[372:45.10]No, I was just describing... Look, I've played this game a lot of times, so I'm just like really excited to explain and talk about everything that I'm doing.
[373:03.19]You were explaining the concept of currency.
[373:06.05]But what if you don't know what that is?
[373:09.99]Oh my god.
[373:10.75]What the fuck.
[373:15.93]Jesus.
[373:25.42]69 again this is what is this the fifth fourth fifth sixth time fifth time in the last like two weeks that phylacter lich has given 69 subs this is like the fifth time you've done this maybe more they don't phylacter lich I don't remember
[373:54.03]Well, regardless, that's, um... That's another 69 subs.
[374:00.89]From Phylactery.
[374:02.47]On top of the... Hundreds and hundreds of bits worth of dollars.
[374:12.03]That's... That's crazy.
[374:16.56]Everyone will be a sub soon.
[374:19.16]Yeah.
[374:25.82]Sometimes I wonder what some of people's occupations are.
[374:30.80]I don't know, might be a doctor.
[374:35.16]In that case, can you look at that?
[374:37.90]I got this itchy thing on my back.
[374:39.42]Can you look at it?
[374:41.67]No, but for real, you've given an astronomical amount of money to the channel over the last month.
[374:49.51]So...
[374:50.48]Thank you.
[374:50.80]You are responsible for hundreds of fucking subs.
[374:53.66]You've given hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
[374:58.40]Thank you.
[375:01.84]I still cannot believe that you would give that many subs pretty much every single stream.
[375:12.44]Thanks a lot.
[375:15.70]We also had...
[375:23.18]Oh my goodness.
[375:24.62]Where are we?
[375:25.16]Over here.
[375:28.06]Alright, right here.
[375:30.41]Mae, thank you Mae Posting for the $5.
[375:32.57]I'm not sure.
[375:49.76]I don't know if I... I do know, like, the secret jokey part, but I'm not going to do it.
[375:56.31]I'm not going to do the joke.
[376:00.13]And those of you guys that know the Geno Whirl meme, I'm not going to do it this playthrough.
[376:04.03]I'm going to actually beat it, right?
[376:06.29]I'm going to actually beat it.
[376:10.73]But yes, I'm going to... I'm going to beat Kulix.
[376:17.71]On this playthrough, yes.
[376:23.75]No Now if I lack your list gave 18 subs to make it so they had 420 gifted subs on the channel think about that think of how many probably subs that is You are responsible for 420 subscriptions They have fulfilled their promise of 420 I
[376:57.14]That is true.
[376:58.16]Barlactor, you did say that before.
[377:01.22]And you've achieved that a few different ways.
[377:05.94]It's the weed number.
[377:06.76]It's the weed number.
[377:09.63]I know it's the weed number.
[377:10.63]I know what the weed number is.
[377:14.05]And then Fly4Shy... Not to be upstaged.
[377:17.97]Fly4Shy dropping 20 community subs.
[377:19.73]20. 20.
[377:30.90]I want one so bad.
[377:34.66]You stick around, you'll probably get one.
[377:41.36]Thank the both of you.
[377:42.32]That's 20 subs and then like 80 something.
[377:47.05]90 something, right?
[377:48.03]From phylactery.
[377:50.41]Thank you for the enormous sub drops.
[377:57.21]Subbing is a sign of weakness.
[377:59.09]Stay strong.
[378:13.63]I don't know why I think that's funny.
[378:19.64]But thank you, both of you, again.
[378:24.12]Hey, I don't even like Taco Bell.
[378:25.48]Gave $2.50.
[378:25.68]Thank you.
[378:25.98]I'm sorry.
[378:41.45]The duality of chat.
[378:43.67]Jerma, why do you have to do the best streams when I work?
[378:46.27]Jerma, why do I always catch your worst streams?
[378:52.97]That happened.
[378:53.97]Both of those happened tonight.
[378:56.79]And you know it.
[378:57.31]We caught it earlier.
[379:07.88]That's funny.
[379:09.98]Just pure duality.
[379:13.44]But, um, I don't know.
[379:15.27]I'm sorry that the streams that you want to watch are conflicting with your schedule.
[379:20.89]But you can watch the VOD.
[379:21.99]The VOD and the chat will exist for at least two months.
[379:27.39]It's not the same.
[379:28.18]I know it's not the same.
[379:29.50]But it's still something.
[379:33.00]Thank you, though.
[379:35.60]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[379:36.50]I don't even like Taco Bell.
[379:40.68]Also, thank you to Pigeon for the $2.50.
[379:44.68]Hey, Jerma, again.
[379:47.08]I'm so fucking excited to meet and hang out with you at TwitchCon.
[379:50.40]And I never really got into this game, but I played the shit out of Superstar Saga.
[379:54.27]What are your thoughts on the Mario and Luigi games?
[379:59.43]I played Superstar Saga, but not the other ones in the series.
[380:05.59]Because there is, what, two, three more after that?
[380:14.18]Something like that.
[380:14.79]The Superstar Saga.
[380:17.21]Then the Dream Team or something.
[380:20.71]Something like sleeping.
[380:21.75]Something about sleeping.
[380:23.09]They sleep in one of them.
[380:26.17]What's the one where they sleep?
[380:28.66]Superstar Saga.
[380:30.72]The one where they sleep.
[380:32.80]Bowser's Inside Story.
[380:42.03]The sleep one is the newest one.
[380:43.37]Oh.
[380:47.55]Luigi's Dream?
[380:49.77]It is Dream Team, isn't it?
[380:52.15]Partners in Time, Bowser's Inside Story, Dream Team, and Paper Jam.
[380:56.35]Okay.
[380:56.55]So there are quite a few of them.
[381:04.34]But yeah, I'll be at SwitchCon.
[381:07.48]I'll be poking around.
[381:08.20]I have no official meeting greets or anything.
[381:11.76]So I'm kind of just going to be just kind of walking around randomly.
[381:17.37]I don't really do any planned real meet and greets or anything.
[381:19.97]Like we talked about it a few times.
[381:24.12]I kind of just am gonna exist there.
[381:30.98]But I have nothing official.
[381:35.31]I'm probably gonna be like in a mustache and shit.
[381:37.01]I'm gonna be like on one of those like glasses and mustaches.
[381:45.56]Actually, if you find me, then you get like a thumbs up.
[381:49.50]I'm gonna be like Glass's mustache.
[381:52.22]Grow a beard.
[381:52.80]My mustache would be part of the beard, I guess.
[382:04.92]And I guess this is the part in the stream where we get a shitload of community subs, because, uh, ya boi just gave 10.
[382:17.08]20.
[382:17.10]20 came in... From Fly4Shy.
[382:26.04]And then... Almost 100 came in from PhylacteryLich.
[382:29.67]And then 10 now from you, boy.
[382:33.79]Oh my goodness.
[382:34.65]Thank you.
[382:38.29]Thank you for the subs.
[382:39.50]Thanks for the community subs, guys.
[382:42.58]You shock me every fucking day.
[382:46.10]I said I wasn't gonna swear on the Mario streams, I forgot.
[382:49.24]How am I ever gonna get that ad-FRIENDLY STREAM?!
[382:53.12]It's never gonna happen.
[382:53.78]Might as well just... forget about it now.
[382:59.64]But, uh, thank you.
[383:02.41]Thank you to, uh... Trampston for the ten bucks.
[383:07.51]Thousand bits from, uh, Trampston.
[383:09.53]McChicken Fund.
[383:11.63]This is for the McChicken Fund.
[383:18.59]I mean, that's at least three McChickens, so... And I'm going to use them for that.
[383:23.65]I promise.
[383:25.45]Thank you for the $10.
[383:30.49]Thank you, Gnarly, for the $2.50.
[383:31.35]I think it would be cool to see you play a Mario RPG game without prior knowledge of it, like Bowser's Inside Story.
[383:37.55]A lot of Bowser's Inside Story fans here, huh?
[383:47.89]There's a lot of people that say, play that one, play that one, play... It's really good.
[383:52.63]It's just a really good game.
[383:53.77]Okay.
[383:59.35]Superstar Saga is the best one.
[384:01.55]Geno's in Superstar Saga.
[384:02.89]A lot of people don't know that.
[384:06.84]Geno is actually in that game.
[384:11.02]Weirdly enough.
[384:17.53]That's true.
[384:20.54]Inside Story was the best one.
[384:22.98]Okay.
[384:29.38]Okay.
[384:30.46]I'll keep that all that knowledge upstairs in the brain.
[384:35.31]Hey, Game Watch.
[384:36.17]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[384:38.65]Game Watch.
[384:40.70]Hey Jeremy, I would meme, but today is my two-year sub-anniversary.
[384:45.56]I've loved your stuff since the first Raven's Cry video, and your streams are consistently the best part of my week.
[384:50.70]Here's to another two years.
[384:54.57]Raven's Cry is the best, worst game I've ever played.
[385:01.79]You know how sometimes you wish you could just memory wipe yourself and do something again?
[385:07.71]That first experience in Raven's Cry was so funny.
[385:18.56]It was so awful.
[385:21.10]But somehow was still worth playing.
[385:23.80]Just because you needed to know what was going to happen next.
[385:28.89]You can't be on that ship with the Be Brave guy and not play the rest of the game.
[385:33.59]At least put another few hours in.
[385:37.30]How could you do that?
[385:41.64]How could you get, like, launched across the map from an animal?
[385:44.19]Or watch, like, an animal throw... Wasn't there an animal throwing rocks at people?
[385:52.55]There was, like, a rock-throwing animal that was whipping rocks at people.
[386:00.38]Yeah, it was like a monkey or something, right?
[386:07.42]rocks at I wish that company would make I want them to make another game please do I hope they made enough money to make another game I really do I truly believe that it was worth playing it was worth it I don't care how much money it was they probably don't exist anymore though unfortunately
[386:36.62]But thank you GameWatch, or GameWatcher, for the 10 bucks.
[386:40.84]Here's to another two years.
[386:44.82]Uh, Erdemius, Erdemius, thanks for the 21 dollars, Erdemius.
[386:48.98]21 bucks coming in from Erdemius89.
[386:53.15]Hey streamer, it's my 21st birthday on Monday, and I wanted to thank you for all the years of top-tier content.
[386:59.77]I wanted to know if you had any life advice from a long-time boomer to a new one.
[387:05.87]Thanks.
[387:06.72]Well, first, thank you.
[387:07.60]Thanks for the $21, 2100 bits.
[387:11.54]Happy birthday on Monday, which is, I mean, I don't know if you're Eastern Time or what time zone you're in, but it might be Monday.
[387:21.25]So, happy birthday, probably.
[387:22.91]Maybe.
[387:23.57]Right now.
[387:27.21]But any life advice?
[387:32.27]Hmm.
[387:34.23]Let me think.
[387:34.59]That's a pretty open-ended question.
[387:38.24]I think the best advice, the just general life advice I can give... Is... Everybody figures it out eventually.
[387:49.95]Some people take longer than others.
[387:54.99]I took a long time.
[387:56.49]To figure it out.
[388:00.69]But eventually you do figure it out.
[388:02.69]For the most part.
[388:06.43]Drink water is a good one too.
[388:12.72]Now that actually is a great piece of general advice.
[388:16.58]Replace at least one or two drinks a day with a glass of water.
[388:26.83]You are going to exponentially help your entire life.
[388:41.38]When I was younger, I used to just drain Mountain Dew Code Reds.
[388:49.20]I didn't drink water when I was younger.
[388:51.08]I didn't.
[388:54.55]And it's really not good for you.
[389:00.52]I have since pretty much eliminated most of, and this is not, I'm not going to be like, I don't drink soda anymore because it's bad.
[389:10.53]That's not what I do.
[389:12.47]I just don't drink it for every single piece of liquid that goes in my body.
[389:20.62]I kind of was one of those people for a little while.
[389:24.41]I don't know why.
[389:25.21]You just kind of are.
[389:27.15]You'd go to, like, restaurants and you'd sit around and people would order.
[389:31.23]Oh, yeah, I'm taking my drink orders.
[389:33.03]What are you having?
[389:34.36]I'll have a Coke.
[389:35.52]I'll have a Coke.
[389:36.40]I'll have a Coke.
[389:37.54]Yeah, I'll take a Coke.
[389:40.12]I'll take a lemon tea, please.
[389:42.96]I don't drink soda.
[389:45.81]And everyone's like, ooh, there he is, the guy that doesn't order the Coke.
[389:53.70]But then I would just be envious.
[389:55.60]Like, watching everybody drink their Cokes, and I'm like, I kind of wish I had one of those.
[390:13.03]But, I drink soda sometimes.
[390:17.46]I'll drink soda just if, you know, sometimes you just feel like it.
[390:21.40]That's fine.
[390:23.58]Sometimes you just want to have a soda.
[390:26.86]Because I feel like it.
[390:29.44]Go for it.
[390:31.76]Sometimes you want to eat like three double cheeseburgers.
[390:35.21]From Burger King.
[390:36.35]Do it.
[390:37.37]And love every second of it.
[390:40.23]Just don't do it every day.
[390:47.27]In fact, don't do that like once a week.
[390:52.26]in fact don't ever do that you shouldn't you should go to you should go to in and out instead they have much better burgers don't they don't go there either make them at home
[391:21.38]Voice actor real stream.
[391:23.06]I don't know, I really am just like... I've gone through all of my range this whole stream.
[391:34.35]I'm reaching for new ones too.
[391:36.05]I'm reaching out to try to find other ones.
[391:40.39]You know, when you've got to do 50 characters, you kind of have to figure out which ones don't sound alike.
[391:47.78]And that concludes my life advice.
[391:51.80]But thank you, Erdemius, for the 21 bucks.
[391:56.81]Do Mickey?
[391:57.31]Uh-huh.
[392:00.17]Oh.
[392:01.03]Donald?
[392:01.27]What are you talking about?
[392:05.04]I almost had it.
[392:05.44]I was close.
[392:07.88]It was really close.
[392:08.94]I had it.
[392:10.54]If I worked on that, I could probably do it.
[392:21.29]Uh, thank you to Sy Chan for the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14... He gave about $15 here.
[392:31.57]Almost $20 here.
[392:34.74]And they say, I'm just posting a bunch to get all the food fight emotes.
[392:37.58]Don't mind me.
[392:41.30]Food fight emotes?
[392:46.02]What are those?
[392:48.29]Let me see.
[392:50.87]What?
[392:53.55]Where do you get that?
[392:56.20]Fight smoothie.
[392:58.22]Fight pup.
[393:00.24]Fight fries.
[393:01.06]Where do you get these pizza emotes and stuff?
[393:02.60]That's cool.
[393:05.26]Hamburgers and mashed potatoes.
[393:09.33]People just gift you them.
[393:10.97]If someone cheers, people get them randomly.
[393:13.03]Oh.
[393:15.79]Oh, that's weird.
[393:17.29]Cool, though.
[393:17.75]Well, I hope you got them.
[393:23.15]And they said, uh, this is a good game.
[393:29.84]They said, I know this is a little spammy.
[393:31.38]I'm sorry.
[393:31.86]I'm almost done.
[393:32.88]No, you're good.
[393:33.70]Don't worry.
[393:37.18]And I don't mind if he doesn't see these messages.
[393:39.10]Like I said, just getting all the emotes.
[393:46.23]Well, you're honest.
[393:47.57]That's good.
[393:48.39]Thank you so much, Sai.
[393:50.45]I think it's Sai Ai Chan.
[393:53.14]They say, enjoy your 20 bucks total.
[393:54.92]Thank you.
[393:55.40]I'm happy that you decided to give it to me.
[394:01.04]Hope you got your emotes.
[394:08.43]Thank you to GrayTax for the $5.
[394:09.71]Dermot, it's been a while.
[394:14.34]Sorry about that.
[394:15.12]This is not much, but I wanted to give you something because you've helped me so much.
[394:20.21]Last month here in the DC area, my house burnt down.
[394:24.45]Oh my god, I'm so sorry to fucking hear that.
[394:30.73]And today I found out that a co-worker that I liked has passed away.
[394:36.44]I've been watching your streams a lot and old videos to help cheer me up.
[394:39.44]Thank you for everything.
[394:40.04]Have a great day or stream.
[394:43.74]I'm really, really sorry to hear all that.
[394:46.42]That sounds like a really, really hard fucking time.
[394:53.11]Hopefully that gets completely situated.
[394:55.21]Hopefully you're safe, number one, and anybody else that was there, whoever it was, family, friends, hopefully you're all okay.
[395:07.86]And I'm sorry for your loss here, losing somebody that you cared about.
[395:12.42]That sounds like a shitload of things to go through in a small amount of time.
[395:21.21]But thank you GrayTax for the $5 and thank you for hanging out here.
[395:31.05]I, as well as everybody else here, are probably very happy to cheer you up.
[395:36.96]Or anybody, for that matter.
[395:38.06]So... Stay safe.
[395:43.70]Stay strong.
[395:45.20]Because that's a lot of stuff to go through.
[395:46.72]I wish you and your family the best.
[395:50.62]I really do.
[395:57.23]Have a great day.
[396:08.43]We also had community subs come in too.
[396:12.81]A lot.
[396:13.89]Not just the ones that came in very recently here.
[396:19.11]We had Otterfiend 10 subs tonight.
[396:21.47]JermaSucks with subs.
[396:23.03]Jeff with subs.
[396:24.98]The Fax Machine with subs.
[396:26.18]We touched upon them, but still.
[396:31.36]There's a lot of community subs tonight.
[396:32.82]I just want to make sure I touch on them again.
[396:37.22]Thank you to Paul Manafort for the $10.
[396:42.82]I like Gino.
[396:44.56]With a smiley.
[396:49.60]Thank you, Paul Manafort, for the thousand bits, the ten dollars.
[396:55.43]They say, I like Geno.
[396:56.65]I do, I do too.
[397:07.02]That's the guy from Smash Brothers.
[397:10.72]Um, Paul Manafort is not in Smash Brothers.
[397:13.00]No, you're talking about Geno.
[397:18.23]Oh.
[397:27.14]He's not.
[397:29.22]And Geno isn't either.
[397:30.60]So that's equally as funny.
[397:39.90]Oh, Geno is in Smash.
[397:41.90]As a... JPG image.
[397:46.22]Oh, I was seething.
[397:49.38]I was inconsolable.
[397:51.36]Because it's not even new artwork or new model.
[397:53.54]It's just like the PNG from the back of the fucking Super Nintendo box.
[397:59.56]You couldn't have had any new artwork.
[398:01.08]Somebody could have drawn them or something.
[398:02.68]Commission anything.
[398:03.76]Why does it have to be like the Super Nintendo image from like the Game Informer poster?
[398:14.94]He's coping right now.
[398:16.02]I am.
[398:16.28]I am.
[398:18.36]I am.
[398:25.69]Geno will never be in Smash.
[398:27.35]No.
[398:28.41]He won't.
[398:29.93]Absolutely not.
[398:31.53]It's never gonna happen.
[398:33.53]There's been almost two... There's been like 15 years of people demanding that Geno is a playable character in Smash Bros.
[398:40.94]And it's never gonna happen.
[398:43.76]They have had like three opportunities with tons of Square involvement.
[398:50.86]Yet Paul Manafort actually is a higher contender than Geno at this point.
[398:56.39]Because all the... Every bullet point, every single... It all pointed to Geno was probably going to be in this game.
[399:11.44]That's it.
[399:12.48]Unless they do a second season pass...
[399:17.01]And they just add, just fucking because.
[399:20.52]They add all the characters that everybody's upset aren't in the game.
[399:24.40]Okay, this is the only way this is going to happen.
[399:26.64]The next few DLC characters are going to be big, great reveals, right?
[399:31.46]Season Pass 2 is going to be like the, alright everybody, relax.
[399:35.23]Waluigi.
[399:36.67]Isaac from Golden Sun.
[399:38.19]Geno.
[399:41.27]They're going to do, if they do that, that's the only way it's going to happen.
[399:52.90]Isaac is never going to get a game, you delusional idiots.
[399:57.41]Well, I was a little nicer with my take on that.
[400:06.17]Yeah, that was a very mean take.
[400:09.05]I'm still holding up hope.
[400:12.57]Like somebody said earlier, the more that I say it'll never happen...
[400:16.66]The more that it maybe would.
[400:18.82]No, it won't.
[400:20.10]No, it's not gonna happen.
[400:24.24]At this stage, they would rather put in anybody else.
[400:34.53]It's nice to dream.
[400:37.35]People said Banjo would never happen, and look how that turned out.
[400:39.81]Yeah, but... But Microsoft...
[400:44.38]has really started to push its kind of collaborative efforts with the other big three, especially Nintendo.
[401:00.33]Square and Nintendo have a decent relationship, I guess.
[401:04.98]But Banjo is one of those characters
[401:09.27]That is such a huge, beloved, rare franchise from the Nintendo 64 era.
[401:18.01]Geno was in this game for 12 hours.
[401:23.20]And then you can see him in the background in Superstar Saga.
[401:27.78]I think he's a great character.
[401:29.12]He's a great character.
[401:29.96]He's really interesting, really cool.
[401:31.08]They could have developed him a little more.
[401:33.34]But Banjo getting in over Geno makes a lot more sense.
[401:41.58]They do have a Geno Mii skin, and it's hurting me.
[401:48.63]Nintendo is probably... The reason why they probably haven't done, like, a Geno DLC or something... Is I have to assume... They're probably scared that they'll release something like that... And, like... 112 people are gonna buy it.
[402:03.62]Because it's probably only 112 of us that actually care about this character.
[402:08.76]You could probably fit us all in an auditorium.
[402:16.15]They could be like a Geno... We love Geno convention.
[402:21.33]And you could fit us all on a school bus.
[402:30.27]I'd be there in my Geno hat, in my Geno shirt, my Geno shorts, my Geno lunchbox, and I'd be so fucking raring to go.
[402:37.15]It'd be awesome.
[402:39.51]But way more people are going to buy the Banjo DLC.
[402:44.32]And I know they have the pass, right?
[402:45.60]But I'm talking about like in years prior as well.
[402:47.48]I don't know.
[402:49.50]Did they even do a pass?
[402:51.28]For the Wii U 1?
[402:51.84]Or did you buy... Could you buy them solo?
[403:07.72]You're underestimating the size.
[403:09.14]I'm just... I'm taking the piss right now.
[403:13.33]My point is there's a lot fewer people that even know who this person is.
[403:17.64]Versus some of the more currently relevant Nintendo or not characters.
[403:32.52]I do love it.
[403:33.18]I think it's a great character.
[403:35.26]I think Mallow's a great character.
[403:36.34]I think Croco's a great character.
[403:37.48]I think some characters you haven't even seen yet are great characters too.
[403:41.97]Is Sans gonna be in Smash?
[403:45.73]I don't think so, no.
[403:51.63]I mean... I don't think that would happen.
[404:07.12]He said no, so he wants him in.
[404:11.95]He has insider information.
[404:14.99]Guys, nobody tells me anything.
[404:18.37]I don't know shit.
[404:20.95]I am the least informed person that you probably watch on Twitch.
[404:32.62]At least in regard... I mean, like, in regards to, like, video game stuff.
[404:39.94]Like, no, no, no, no, I'm talking, no, I'm not talking about like video game related news and information.
[404:46.56]This is not, I don't have any of that.
[404:57.37]Alright.
[405:06.22]But thank you, Paul Manafort for the $10.
[405:08.16]I really do love Gino as well.
[405:12.61]I look forward to maining you in Smash Bros.
[405:15.09]Switch 2.
[405:18.37]Hey, Aerolus, thanks for the $2.50.
[405:19.69]Jeremy Elberton is my favorite broadcaster.
[405:21.63]I think he's alright.
[405:26.91]Jeff Putis, thanks for the $2.50.
[405:28.62]Hey, Jerma, can you wish my good friend Daphne a happy 23rd birthday?
[405:31.64]Yes, absolutely.
[405:34.30]Happy birthday, Daphne.
[405:36.14]Have a good 23rd birthday.
[405:40.64]Jeff says hello.
[405:43.15]Happy birthday.
[405:45.44]Make it a good one.
[405:49.40]Wait, isn't Pluto a planet again?
[405:50.66]Remember when everyone laughed at me and talked shit to me and called me all kinds of names when I said that that was going to happen?
[405:58.15]Anybody remember that?
[406:02.33]Anybody remember that happening?
[406:08.07]I do.
[406:08.33]I do.
[406:17.03]One day ago, NASA boss jokingly declares Pluto a planet.
[406:29.07]Whatever.
[406:32.65]No, no, no, no, this is the real one.
[406:34.79]Is Pluto a planet?
[406:35.71]NASA administrator, a NASA administrator may reignite the argument
[406:45.07]Hold on.
[406:50.66]I'm gonna read this whole fucking thing.
[406:53.87]Strap in for this one.
[406:57.73]In 2006, the International Astronomical Union caused consternation when it declared that Pluto was no longer a planet.
[407:04.68]Several bodies of similar size had been found in the Kuiper Belt, so the IAU created a definition that included a criterion that a planet must clear the neighborhood around its orbit, which Pluto does not.
[407:17.87]Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.
[407:21.13]A dwarf planet.
[407:23.23]A dwarf planet.
[407:26.62]in a move which upset anyone who grew up learning about a solar system consisting of nine planets.
[407:33.33]Now, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has reignited the fierce debate over Pluto's status by unexpectedly coming out in favor of it being a planet.
[407:47.74]Just so you know, in my view, Pluto is a planet, he said in a tongue-in-cheek clip posted to Twitter.
[407:57.10]You can write that the NASA administrator declared Pluto a planet once again.
[408:01.28]I'm sticking by that.
[408:02.44]It's the way I learned it.
[408:03.48]I'm committed to it.
[408:06.88]Sorry.
[408:07.22]It's a planet.
[408:18.03]Link the article.
[408:18.93]Just type... You know how easy this article is to find?
[408:21.97]Just type in Pluto planet.
[408:23.81]It's in fucking Google.
[408:25.81]It's everywhere.
[408:37.57]Guys, there's a debate right now between is Pluto a planet or not.
[408:44.25]A dwarf planet is a dwarf- hold on, is it- remember when I said Pluto's a planet and everyone's like, it's not a planet!
[408:51.86]What does it come after?
[408:52.38]What comes after dwarf?
[408:55.40]It starts with a P. I don't know what that- what is it?
[408:58.88]What's the word that comes after dwarf?
[409:00.76]P. Something- lan- lanet?
[409:03.02]Planet?
[409:05.92]Planet a dwarf planet, but it's not a planet though, but it just gets called a dwarf planet.
[409:11.08]So what is it then a Broadcaster oh fuck off That's that's purge worthy.
[409:18.74]That's purge worthy for me.
[409:19.94]That's it.
[409:20.57]That's purge worthy It's a dwarf planet it's a planet
[409:48.91]Oh, the moons of Jupiter are planets too.
[409:51.67]No, because they're moons.
[409:53.43]They're not dwarf planets.
[410:02.06]Hey, thank you, Frodian Weapon, for the 250.
[410:03.44]I gotta say, it's fun hearing all your different voices for the dialogue.
[410:07.02]Quite the impressive range.
[410:08.12]Thank you.
[410:17.52]Thank you.
[410:21.19]Thank you Manboy for the three dolls.
[410:22.67]How about some director's commentary?
[410:26.21]What do you mean director's commentary?
[410:31.33]Super Mario RPG, my favorite game of all time.
[410:33.57]This is a nine minute video.
[410:35.61]Oh no, I'm not linking this.
[410:37.79]I'm not going to be the one that links this.
[410:39.97]This is like peak... This is like peak YouTuber voice.
[410:46.41]This is peak YouTuber voice, Jeremy.
[410:49.35]Hey everybody, welcome back to Enlighten, where I talk about one of my favorite games of all time.
[410:54.01]Yeah, this is, this is peak Tuber voice.
[410:56.91]It's fine, just type in fucking Tuber voice Jerma.
[411:00.46]Mario, type in Jerma Super Mario RPG favorite game of all time.
[411:05.30]Alright, you know what, fucking here you go.
[411:06.48]Just take, just here, take it.
[411:12.06]Don't watch that.
[411:14.02]If you do, tell me in the comments how you feel about it.
[411:22.84]Errolis gave $2.50 as well, and they say, please don't delete this.
[411:26.71]It's Otto's Big Adventure 2.
[411:29.29]I'm not going to delete Otto's Big Adventure 2.
[411:31.59]I actually have grown to love that video.
[411:35.45]Critical Chaos, thanks for the $10.
[411:38.32]$10 from Critical Chaos.
[411:41.12]Thanks for being funny.
[411:42.04]You never fail to make me laugh.
[411:45.38]Thank you for the $10.
[411:48.51]I'm happy you think that.
[411:49.35]I'm happy that you can have fun.
[411:55.40]Thank you so much, Critical Chaos.
[411:59.67]Wiki this thanks for three bucks.
[412:01.71]Friendship with Mallow has ended.
[412:03.27]Bowser is our new best friend.
[412:06.63]Until we potentially replace Bowser with Peach.
[412:09.87]I'm not sure.
[412:10.33]I usually do Mario, Bowser, Geno.
[412:15.11]It's what I've done every single time.
[412:16.79]So it might be time to change it up.
[412:19.37]Maybe we throw Peach in there.
[412:22.57]Maybe I replace Geno for the first time ever.
[412:26.60]That would be bad.
[412:27.62]I don't know if I can handle that.
[412:31.26]I don't think I could do that.
[412:31.94]I don't know.
[412:37.32]Hey, SirK9, thanks for the $5.
[412:38.50]Hey, Jerma, it's Kevin's mom from Kinect Sports.
[412:42.80]How have you been since you gave my son...
[412:51.43]Permanent.
[412:51.79]Okay.
[412:52.65]They're talking about, like, the boxing, whatever.
[412:55.28]I see you're streaming now.
[412:56.28]Hope that's going well for you.
[412:57.14]Remember Han Solo?
[412:57.98]That was the last song Kevin heard.
[413:14.72]Thank you, SirK9, for the five dollars.
[413:16.88]They end this with, good job, you hay shit.
[413:28.65]Thank you for the $5.
[413:31.83]Hey, shit.
[413:32.55]What was that, though?
[413:33.41]I couldn't pay that much attention to it.
[413:38.91]Hey, shit.
[413:39.80]What was that?
[413:43.44]Thank you, Superintendent Charlmush, for the $2.50.
[413:45.08]Joel has come across those Sims 4 mugs.
[413:49.62]Oh, I hope that he has a lot of fun.
[413:58.56]Those are the best mods ever.
[414:06.59]Hey shit.
[414:09.37]One guy called you hey shit and you read it out loud.
[414:12.33]Was there anything to it?
[414:20.25]Or was it just hey shit?
[414:26.45]No.
[414:29.85]Hey, shit.
[414:31.83]I love that.
[414:33.91]Joel is playing this right now.
[414:35.95]Alright, we're gonna have to raid Joel, because if they're doing a Sims 4, like, fucking horror house, you guys would probably really like that, so.
[414:49.76]But thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.
[414:51.46]Chalmers, thank you.
[414:52.32]Abomination 0 for the $4.
[414:55.28]Obligatory I give you money joke.
[414:58.67]Thanks for the money.
[415:00.63]Hey, Errorless, thanks for the $2.50.
[415:01.77]I loved this game as a kid and it was great seeing it again.
[415:04.05]Thanks.
[415:04.95]You'll probably see it again really soon.
[415:06.21]Because now that it's started, I would like to finish it way sooner rather than later.
[415:13.49]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $5 here total.
[415:17.69]Super Mario RPG, it is the only one for just me.
[415:20.82]When I play the game, I get lost in a phase.
[415:22.88]Then I find out I'm stuck in Geno's maze.
[415:27.24]It is tough.
[415:28.68]Especially when you don't know what you're doing.
[415:30.86]But I do.
[415:33.54]I do.
[415:37.08]And they say, I don't know about you, but I would love to see an HD remaster of this game.
[415:40.62]Not to say the original isn't awesome, but seeing these graphics in full HD would be amazing.
[415:45.35]Especially if the original renders were used.
[415:49.95]I would love that, and I would also love an actual Super Mario RPG 2.
[415:59.35]That would be great.
[416:01.35]They were going to do it, but they canned it.
[416:03.89]I don't know why.
[416:07.17]Problems.
[416:08.99]For some reason.
[416:12.02]But let's get the credits rolling.
[416:13.24]We only have a few more bits to do, so let's get those credits on screen.
[416:17.00]This is going to be a lot of subs on this list.
[416:22.04]Considering the amount of community subs that were given over the last 30 to 40 minutes.
[416:34.43]Was it going to be a sneak peek of the carnival tonight, or did I dream that?
[416:37.56]Oh, it's because it's like... That's going pretty fast.
[416:40.90]I already did the carnival.
[416:42.80]That was just a joke I was making.
[416:44.96]Because they said, like, if you're good, then you get something special.
[416:47.72]And I said that, like, yesterday, so... I did it last night.
[416:55.11]I did, and I'm incredibly excited for it.
[416:58.91]I almost cannot contain myself.
[417:07.96]Did the carnival stream happen?
[417:09.08]No, it's happening on the 21st of September.
[417:11.71]So in just about three weeks.
[417:16.89]Is everyone going to be the same or are subs going to have access to special stuff?
[417:20.35]Everyone is going to be on the same playing field.
[417:22.43]Completely.
[417:32.61]But we had... We had...
[417:37.43]$10 from Ahahua.
[417:40.26]Ahahua.
[417:41.54]Ahahua.
[417:42.26]I think I'm saying that right.
[417:43.78]It's Ahahua.
[417:45.40]If I'm doing it right.
[417:50.60]Thank you for the $10.
[417:51.28]They say, Thank you for the years of entertainment.
[417:52.63]Thank you for the years of your attention.
[418:04.56]Seven years is a long time to continue to still think that the things I say and do are interesting.
[418:10.33]So thanks for hanging around for that long.
[418:14.35]Thank you for the ten bucks.
[418:20.05]Even live for seven hours, you should have consumed a bunch of water.
[418:23.56]Yeah, I've refilled it a few times.
[418:25.00]I'm good.
[418:28.24]But thank you for the ten bucks.
[418:29.42]Appreciate it.
[418:31.21]All Mew, thanks for 250.
[418:32.43]Can I get an F in the chat for my frogs that died recently?
[418:35.89]No idea how or why and my week is ruined.
[418:39.03]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[418:44.92]Rest in peace to your frogs.
[418:50.64]I'm sure they were great, great, great pets.
[418:59.20]I love frogs.
[419:01.36]I love frogs.
[419:01.80]I love toads.
[419:05.77]Back in Massachusetts when it was a lot wetter, there were frogs and toads everywhere.
[419:12.39]Just randomly in the grass.
[419:14.21]Every time you'd see a toad or a frog, it would just be like, oh, yes!
[419:19.46]I'd walk over and just look at them.
[419:21.36]And they would just be staring up, just like hanging out.
[419:26.08]They're cute.
[419:31.47]And they eat a shitload of bugs.
[419:33.63]So they're awesome.
[419:36.43]The amount of frogs... The amount of bugs that... Mosquitoes and flies that frogs and toads eat... They're helping you out.
[419:45.92]They're taking care of you.
[419:47.32]You just don't know it.
[419:50.30]But thank you, Almu.
[419:51.20]And again, I'm really sorry to hear about you frogs.
[419:56.99]Take care.
[420:02.86]Thank you, OhChase for the $10.
[420:03.80]Love you, Jerm.
[420:05.10]Can I PM you?
[420:09.29]I do not have open PMs.
[420:12.77]I don't.
[420:14.15]Unless I'm in the Discord.
[420:18.00]And I do this because I found over the years that it's impossible to keep up with.
[420:25.92]used to have like Steam friends and Steam open and it can be added but it's just it's I'll be honest it's just kind of too much for me to handle and when I actually am streaming when I actually and after the streams and before streams I would rather focus on making content making streams hanging out
[420:51.86]I don't really have a whole lot of time to have like open PMs and just kind of talk to people.
[420:58.33]I do show up in the Discord all the time.
[421:01.83]Or in pre-stream chat.
[421:02.89]I'll hang out here for a couple hours.
[421:04.13]I was here two days ago.
[421:06.51]I was in the chat for about two or three hours just hanging out when I wasn't feeling good.
[421:17.04]But if there is something that you want to get across to me,
[421:22.88]And it's something important, right?
[421:25.86]And I would say important as in, you know, use your common sense and due diligence to know what would be important.
[421:34.44]Then there are mods that you can ping and PM and they can get the messages to me.
[421:47.08]But it also kind of
[421:49.68]That same type of way of thinking is the same reason why I don't do like reading bits and subs on stream anymore.
[421:59.16]I mean, obviously we hang out for like an hour or so at the end of streams.
[422:03.36]But when I'm like in, when I'm in like the mode to stream and hang out and talk and do all this stuff, that's what I want to do.
[422:18.49]So you don't have any nudes.
[422:20.91]nudes uh no but no I to kind of end that whole thing I don't do like open pms I don't really I the only way that I really reach out to like the collective community
[422:44.49]is through Discord, hanging out in the general, or in pre-stream.
[422:48.74]Unless if you want, if you need to ping a mod about something, that's something that you think is important, then we can figure it out.
[422:54.54]But thank you, I do appreciate it.
[422:55.90]Thank you for the $10.
[422:59.07]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[423:02.65]Do I browse my own subreddit?
[423:03.89]I do.
[423:06.33]Not all the time, but I do check in from time to time to see what they're doing over there.
[423:16.31]I'll check you know sometimes I just want to know you need to know what people are saying does he needs when he needs an ego boost no thank you snoozing coffin for the 250 hey I'm going to Dallas for a month
[423:40.53]It's pretty exciting because it'll be the longest time I'll be on my own, pretty much.
[423:44.45]I've only been on a plane twice.
[423:46.79]I'm still anxious about planes.
[423:49.37]You fly a lot now, don't you?
[423:51.09]To LA or California and back.
[423:53.05]How do you deal with that?
[423:53.69]Were you never scared about it or did you just normalize it with time?
[423:57.10]And it will be exciting in a different time zone, closer to the normal stream times too.
[424:04.40]I've flown on enough planes where it's just a car that goes in the air.
[424:18.32]It's a very loud car, yes.
[424:22.38]Flying used to make me nervous until I realized and I thought about there are people that fly three, four, five, six plus times a week.
[424:35.01]Every week.
[424:37.89]And they just kind of get on and get off.
[424:41.09]Get on, get off, go about their regular day.
[424:46.68]So, the one time that I would be flying, be like, oh shit, I really don't want to get on a plane.
[424:51.04]There's a guy walking by me with a briefcase that that's his sixth or seventh plane ride today.
[424:56.16]And I'm just like, oh.
[425:00.66]Why is... He seems like everything's cool.
[425:04.66]Alright.
[425:07.04]Yeah, this is easy then.
[425:12.20]The one thing I can't do is I can't sleep on planes.
[425:14.32]No matter how much I try.
[425:15.22]Because I could be the most exhausted in my entire life.
[425:18.04]I could stay awake for two or three straight days.
[425:20.74]And I would not be able to sleep on the plane.
[425:28.90]Those are actors?
[425:31.41]The guy walking around with a briefcase in the airport is not... He's just doing that because he wants people to think he's a businessman?
[425:38.39]That's what he does?
[425:40.71]On his days off, he just, I'm gonna, okay, it's my day off.
[425:44.13]I'm gonna put a bunch of blank computer paper in a briefcase.
[425:48.49]And like shuffle the papers around at the terminal and like check my watch.
[425:53.37]Open up a laptop and look at it, close it.
[425:56.75]And then I, ah, feels pretty good.
[426:02.27]No, they get paid to do that.
[426:03.47]No, why would anybody be paid to do that?
[426:13.29]He's hired by the airport to just be a guy.
[426:17.77]How many of these guys are there?
[426:20.73]They, what, they just have like a hundred fake business people having an illusion of people traveling?
[426:27.35]It's so people don't get, like you don't get scared by planes.
[426:40.01]So what about the people on the plane?
[426:43.12]there's like two three hundred people on that plane is like only four people that actually bought a ticket uh
[427:08.33]first class is a scam to make you think you're getting a good a cheap ticket so what all the people in first class it's not real and they're like oh those are like a thousand dollars a seat but they're not actually used so oh good thing I'm not sitting there that's too much crazy mine was only 342.
[427:36.48]what a shitty fucking imagine having to like imagine having to sit on an airplane and you're not even working you're not doing anything like flight attendants for instance right they fly every day multiple times a day but they are they're they're working
[427:57.05]They are getting drinks, talking to passengers, they're doing safety protocols, they're in contact with the work crews and the luggage.
[428:05.01]Imagine if like you just sat in the seat and you didn't do anything.
[428:13.94]I would not be able to do that job.
[428:19.36]What about an air marshal?
[428:20.25]Yeah, but an air marshal has like a specific, they're like a specific task.
[428:24.35]They're like security.
[428:27.27]Your job is to just be on the airplane with an iPad in your hand.
[428:35.32]I think I would lose my mind.
[428:41.20]You just get to watch movies on the airplane.
[428:42.94]But that's... Just bring a... I guess you could just...
[428:52.81]bring a DS and just play the DS or like Warcraft or something.
[428:57.31]But then the jig is up because wouldn't everybody do that?
[429:03.98]If you were a career pretend in the airplane actor, they're all going to have WoW accounts.
[429:10.96]And you're going to look around as the one person that bought the ticket and it's going to be like 60 laptops.
[429:16.07]People are going to be playing WoW in the same server.
[429:17.95]You're going to know who you're sitting next to.
[429:19.79]You're going to have your own like in-crew WoW server.
[429:31.09]It's gonna look strange when you're like, wait a minute, I just went up to go to the bathroom, and all these people in this strange, all these people on this plane are in the same Molten Core raid?
[429:43.71]That's kind of odd, is it?
[429:46.13]Is there a gaming convention going on, like, where I'm going?
[429:56.73]I've played Mario Kart DS multiplayer on airplanes with people.
[430:00.29]Well, we found the actor.
[430:03.19]How is it?
[430:05.61]Is it fun?
[430:12.24]Alright, alright, alright.
[430:15.14]But no.
[430:15.98]Planes, I take planes all the time.
[430:20.90]They can be stressful when they're long.
[430:23.64]And...
[430:25.52]when you can't really sleep but you do get to go across ridiculous amounts of land and sea like five thousand times faster than you would normally so it's kind it's it's worth it to you know gotta go through security you gotta go do all this you gotta sit on the plane who are you sitting with yeah how big is your seat oh I'm like gotta go to the bathroom
[430:52.42]However long it is, usually I... Anything less than like three to six hours for me is I can completely handle.
[430:59.64]Totally fine.
[431:01.52]I just wish I could sleep.
[431:05.91]They just changed the sets outside the airplane and it takes a couple hours.
[431:09.71]So what you're adding on top of this, saying that you're not actually leaving.
[431:15.33]The plane, where does the plane take you?
[431:17.35]So everyone gets in there, there's like 150 actors and there's three people that bought a ticket.
[431:21.86]And they put up a Gremlins 2 pretend outside scenery.
[431:28.64]They make some noise.
[431:31.75]And then, but how do you explain where you end up?
[431:34.81]Is that just down the street?
[431:37.87]Is that like the Truman Show?
[431:39.51]Where we have like two miles of actual livable Earth?
[431:48.49]The entire airport is moving.
[431:53.59]Like a floating disk island?
[432:00.62]You never wonder why all the trees look the same?
[432:04.34]That is true.
[432:05.10]Why the fuck do all trees look- Why are all trees the same?
[432:09.36]You might be onto something here.
[432:12.20]You just go on an elevator.
[432:16.18]So wait, you got like seven layers of hell.
[432:20.29]You just go in an elevator, and you go to, like, layer one, and that's, like, what, like, Cincinnati?
[432:25.47]Layer two is, like... I don't know, Boston?
[432:32.22]New York?
[432:35.68]Layer three is, what, just, like, in different layers of the crust?
[432:54.69]Just different classic WoW layers.
[433:06.33]I love this, it's so stupid.
[433:10.33]Alright, let's get out of here.
[433:16.55]Birds aren't real either.
[433:21.04]Alright, I'm done.
[433:21.64]Oh, we gotta move on.
[433:23.38]I'm going to bed.
[433:25.51]Thank you, Wolfgang, for the $5.
[433:28.51]Say you should have gone for the head in Mickey Mouse.
[433:31.85]Oh, you should have gone for the head, Donald.
[433:37.11]Why did I do that?
[433:49.98]Why is it always Donald?
[433:51.80]Anybody, listen.
[433:53.84]Tell somebody, doesn't matter who it is, to do a Mickey Mouse impression.
[433:59.30]They're going to go, I don't think I can do that.
[434:01.56]I'm not sure.
[434:03.18]And you go, no, no, just give it a try.
[434:05.26]They're always going to end whatever they say with Donald.
[434:11.25]Donald.
[434:12.01]Donald.
[434:28.07]And they always start with a laugh.
[434:29.23]Yeah, they always go like... It's, no, it's... It's... Alright, bye.
[434:43.10]Thank you, Future Game, for the 250.
[434:44.62]My family has a water cooler in their house, and it's amazing.
[434:49.39]I have a liter bottle I constantly fill it up with.
[434:53.09]That's awesome.
[434:54.59]Some services ship water in gallon jugs, but Walmart also has machines that you can use to refill jugs for really cheap.
[435:00.42]That also saves on plastic from not using water bottles.
[435:02.74]I really recommend, chat, get one.
[435:04.84]That's a great fucking idea.
[435:08.12]I'm gonna get one of those.
[435:14.21]Let's go raid Joel.
[435:15.41]Okay, goodbye.
[435:15.99]I'll see you tomorrow, Terraria.
[435:18.05]And, uh...
[435:20.65]However long we do that, maybe some more Mario RPG to close out the night.
[435:23.68]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[435:25.16]Take care.
[435:25.50]See you later.
[435:26.14]Go say hello to Joel.
[435:27.16]They're playing The Sims 4 modded.
[435:30.36]See you later.
[435:32.78]Now I have to spell their name correctly because I always fuck this up.
[435:43.59]Wait, Joel is ending the stream.
[435:49.03]Joel is ending the stream?
[435:53.92]Oh.
[435:57.48]Well, I already, like, pressed the button.
[436:01.66]Alright, go say goodnight.
[436:03.64]Say goodnight.
[436:08.03]Alright, hurry up.
[436:10.95]I'll see you later.
[436:11.95]Bye.
[436:13.11]Quickly.
[436:14.45]Before I... Before it runs out.
[436:23.45]See you tomorrow.
[436:24.11]Goodbye.
[436:30.97]Tell him to send you somewhere else.
