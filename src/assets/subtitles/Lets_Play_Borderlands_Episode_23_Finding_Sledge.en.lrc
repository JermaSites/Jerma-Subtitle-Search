[00:10.17]Just so I know for future reference.
[00:11.53]Over here.
[00:13.61]That is not my ammo.
[00:15.21]Okay.
[00:16.09]These are all... They look like maybe rockets, shotguns.
[00:19.17]These are shotgun shells.
[00:20.27]There's more stuff over here.
[00:26.54]Oh, okay.
[00:28.26]This is my ammo right here.
[00:29.46]These are sniper rifle cartridges.
[00:31.00]Where?
[00:31.90]This right here.
[00:32.30]The one to the left.
[00:34.20]Okay, good.
[00:35.78]Yeah, they even look like them.
[00:37.34]Cool.
[00:40.32]I know that they got dropped something but you know I think I said I picked it up just despite run over to grab it it was it was a explosive stick equipped to throw sticky grenades to create attached services and explode after a few seconds bagel looks like a badass are you all sniper the whole you know I have to just over this thing up top
[01:08.12]Oh yeah, so also, guys, we record in bulk.
[01:11.04]So, for example, right now we're recording like an hour and 15, an hour and 30.
[01:15.32]So, you just need to know that, keep that in mind.
[01:18.32]So, if it takes us time to fix whatever we need to fix in the series.
[01:23.88]Alright, what is this?
[01:24.92]My shield is better.
[01:26.26]On a shotgun and... Is this an SMG?
[01:28.42]Oh yeah, it's an SMG.
[01:30.10]Let me see this.
[01:31.98]The fire rate is up, the accuracy is up.
[01:37.21]Let me take that bad boy.
[01:39.63]I'm not gonna equip it though.
[01:43.17]Ooh!
[01:44.67]Light healing kit.
[01:47.88]They know we're here.
[01:51.72]I'm just gonna chuck a nade down there, you can stay.
[01:56.54]We'll leave that there for now.
[01:59.18]I'll go and flank.
[02:00.85]Oh shit, we have a bandit raider right next to us.
[02:03.03]Don't worry about those guys.
[02:05.53]Right out here, right out here.
[02:11.09]burn these guys.
[02:11.99]Let's see.
[02:20.92]Where are they?
[02:26.20]Back!
[02:26.78]Back.
[02:29.75]Die.
[02:30.75]Die.
[02:31.27]Die.
[02:32.19]I'm just waiting for my health.
[02:33.31]I already have full health.
[02:38.52]Alright.
[02:39.20]There's a lot of stuff here.
[02:40.40]This little stuff is nice.
[02:41.92]Yeah, I'll clear out this.
[02:44.06]Watch out, there's a propane tank there, just so you know.
[02:47.30]Well, let me shoot it.
[02:49.83]Let me stand right next to it and shoot it.
[02:53.25]That's what I did.
[02:55.11]Earlier in the series, when I used to shoot the barrels right next to us.
[02:58.71]Oh, boy.
[02:59.23]Okay.
[02:59.83]Ooh, okay, okay.
[03:00.87]Incendiary rifle.
[03:03.33]I don't know whether I should use that, because I'm not that good at rifles, I believe.
[03:07.73]Shit, okay, wait, I have to drop something.
[03:12.19]The patrol SMG, that's level four.
[03:14.27]Yeah, I'm gonna drop that.
[03:17.79]The scattergun, not my thing.
[03:19.36]Yeah, I'm pretty sure that your proficiency is SMGs.
[03:26.26]That's like your number one gun.
[03:28.34]But what about this... What did I just pick up?
[03:35.03]This, um, whatever.
[03:37.69]Okay, guys, blow us.
[03:38.89]Do they have shields?
[03:40.93]No.
[03:41.17]Okay, watch out, watch out.
[03:44.83]Oh, yeah, and whenever they have, like, an aura around them, it means that, here, that guy will burn out.
[03:52.37]Watch out, this guy's nading us from far.
[03:54.47]Oh, boy.
[03:55.15]I'm gonna go get him.
[03:56.13]I'll go get that guy.
[03:58.61]Never mind.
[04:02.07]God, I love that thing.
[04:03.13]Still out of reach.
[04:05.34]Oh my god, there are a lot of guys.
[04:06.80]I would come back here.
[04:15.56]There are a lot of guys here.
[04:20.53]I'm just trying to light them on fire just to get some help out of them.
[04:25.33]Oh boy.
[04:26.89]I'm losing health quickly.
[04:28.78]I need to get down there.
[04:30.22]You out?
[04:31.38]I'm down, yeah.
[04:41.58]Shit, me too.
[04:43.74]Try and get a kill on somebody.
[04:46.90]I'm getting blocked by this little... Here, maybe I should respawn.
[04:50.02]Yeah, I'm gonna respawn.
[04:52.95]I just don't want them to heal up, you know?
[04:55.89]Yeah, there was a lot of guys on, like, that top roof.
[04:58.43]Oh, not even that far.
[04:59.37]Oh, that's good.
[05:00.87]Oh, yeah, and if you guys hear any sound, we have some people getting housework done, so... Sorry about that.
[05:13.59]I'm coming.
[05:14.13]Alright, I'm right behind you.
[05:20.91]Well, those guys brought it.
[05:22.45]Yeah.
[05:22.63]There was like seven of them just shooting at us from far away.
[05:26.96]Alright.
[05:29.32]Alright, let's attack.
[05:29.88]Let's see, we got a guy down there.
[05:32.36]He's got shields.
[05:33.76]He's dead.
[05:34.24]Nice shot.
[05:35.72]He's dead.
[05:36.38]Holy crap.
[05:38.29]See how much those guys are shooting at us?
[05:40.07]Yeah.
[05:41.03]I would just sit back here and just try and pick them off.
[05:43.41]Yeah.
[05:44.19]I'm gonna go try and take one of them out.
[05:48.09]Good idea.
[05:48.37]Wow, that failed.
[05:49.10]That failed.
[05:49.50]That failed.
[05:49.96]Shit.
[05:50.36]Alright, I'm getting their shields down.
[05:55.14]Their shields are down.
[05:57.68]Headshots.
[06:03.27]Go.
[06:07.63]I think I should have done so the only guys up top was a guy on the left all that guy okay no wonder that guy's on a machine gun he's on like a minigun up there that's why we're getting destroyed shoot him he's just relentlessly level 17 to who I am I'm a level up so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go run over there where is he
[06:38.32]He's up on the, uh, on the top.
[06:41.99]Aim at me.
[06:43.57]Okay, wait, he's not aiming at me yet.
[06:44.77]Yeah, he's sitting there just shooting big.
[06:46.71]Alright, there we go.
[06:48.15]Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go like that, and I got him.
[06:52.54]Awesome.
[06:53.30]Shit, shit, I'm getting shot at from somewhere.
[07:03.22]Oh, I'll get this guy, don't worry.
[07:04.41]I'm not coming back.
[07:06.25]Oh, maybe I will.
[07:12.60]Are you good?
[07:13.70]Yeah, I'll be fine.
[07:15.36]Can you revive me?
[07:16.12]Oh, no, no.
[07:17.86]This guy will die.
[07:18.54]Don't worry.
[07:19.83]Oh, I have to respawn.
[07:23.03]Oh, sorry, man.
[07:23.63]I was trying to come.
[07:24.97]It's good.
[07:25.51]Here, I moved back.
[07:26.53]They're out of the gunner seat, though, just so you know.
[07:28.89]Yeah, that guy was wrecking us.
[07:30.93]Alright, I'm gonna use my experience point on decrease the cooldown of phase walk or killing an enemy causes your shield to quickly regenerate for a few seconds.
[07:44.16]I'm gonna level the hard-to-get one, which is... whatever.
[07:47.94]It's the decreased cooldown.
[07:51.72]What's good is when you use an experience point, it heals you up.
[07:55.00]It should, at least.
[07:56.24]Here, I'll take that healing kit.
[07:57.64]I needed that.
[07:59.40]Another one right here.
[08:04.13]That guy's weak as hell.
[08:05.01]Another healing kit right next to me.
[08:09.13]Here, I'll get it in a sec.
[08:10.93]Oh, I'm getting chased.
[08:17.17]No!
[08:19.19]He's dead.
[08:23.01]He's dead.
[08:24.07]Nice.
[08:24.95]Where was the healing kit?
[08:26.84]Right over here, right here.
[08:27.86]We have money over here.
[08:29.68]I'm standing right on it right now.

[08:49.24]You're into shotguns.
[08:50.50]There's a whole lot of them right there.
[08:52.36]I think shotguns are for the soldier.
[08:55.34]Or for the big guy.
[08:57.19]I think it's the big guy.
[08:58.37]The big guy's hilarious.
[08:59.67]His special ability is he just goes berserker mode and just runs up and punches people, I think.
[09:06.61]it's pretty much you pretty much the heavy strung up onto people and so we're we have to go to keep going this way to go up there somehow absolutely love my special ability ability ability yeah it is pretty pretty bad as I found some little little guy yeah just picking up the money that's in here aren't and seals

[09:44.46]Uh, we are not supposed to go in there.
[09:46.80]Nope.
[09:47.48]We're gonna go in this big, worn-down house.

[10:25.38]Yep.

[11:40.88]Yeah, I think there's a boss up here.
[11:43.28]We're about to fight a boss.
[11:45.36]I just want to sell my stuff.
[11:50.66]Alright, so the question is how do we get up there?

[12:04.67]You just shoot it.
[12:06.63]There must be something in here, too.
[12:07.89]In these houses, there's always some stuff.
[12:11.43]We have to get in this big house, somehow.
[12:14.87]Alright, let's figure this out.

[12:20.30]Get her to fly up there.
[12:22.34]Yeah, bring us up there, Bloodwing.
[12:23.42]What are you thinking?
[12:28.16]Oh, yeah, actually, you know what?
[12:29.09]Maybe we do have to go in this mine and go around.
[12:31.55]Yeah.
[12:34.15]So it looks like we've got thugs.
[12:40.81]Oh, I'm using the wrong SMG.
[12:43.29]I absolutely love this healing thing, because it gives you back health.
[12:52.72]Holy shit, who's laughing?
[12:54.14]Oh, Jesus.
[12:54.68]Oh, yeah, this guy's standing right next to you.
[13:04.87]Nice punch.
[13:05.79]See that aura he has around him?
[13:08.43]That means he's dazed, because I have a chance of dazing them when I use my skill.
[13:12.71]Oh, cool.
[13:13.03]Alright, keep going this way.
[13:18.00]Alright, let's see what we have right here.
[13:24.04]Oh, these checkpoints are godly.
[13:25.72]Oh, yes.
[13:26.34]Yeah, that's key right there.
