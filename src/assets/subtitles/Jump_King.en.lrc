[00:01.60]Hey, everybody.
[00:03.05]How are you?
[00:10.85]Hi.
[00:11.93]Don't upset him.
[00:14.23]That's right.
[00:15.66]Don't upset me right now.
[00:20.92]That's not 1 out of 10.
[00:22.36]You'll know when it's 1 out of 10.
[00:26.33]I'm giving myself a way to relax, you know?
[00:32.32]I'm giving myself a cutoff.
[00:34.30]Because if it happens 10 times, then I'm going to leave.
[00:40.81]I'll see you later.
[00:42.05]You know what I mean?
[00:43.19]You've got to give yourself a... It's not healthy to get angry and then bring it down like 50 times in one day.
[00:50.49]It's not good for you.
[00:51.75]It's not good for you.
[00:52.70]So we're going to cap it at 10.
[00:55.63]I got a mauve meter, that's right.
[00:59.63]Oh, by the way, I actually have to change that to two.
[01:05.60]My coffee got fucked up this morning, and I was very upset by it.
[01:09.84]And then I stubbed my toe coming out of bed.
[01:15.04]And I screamed into the pillow, so that's already two out of ten.
[01:23.76]Anyways, I want to talk about some stuff before we go forward.
[01:27.00]I want to talk about last night.
[01:29.44]I want to talk about the game.
[01:30.86]And I want to talk about some stuff.
[01:34.02]Because that was the first time we even turned that server on.
[01:36.56]We got a lot to discuss.
[01:39.40]First thing to discuss is... Well, hold on.
[01:42.40]Let me tweet this first.
[01:43.54]So people know that I'm live.
[01:45.64]You know what I mean?
[01:46.14]How would they know?
[01:48.36]By the way, where's the... Oh, there it is.
[01:53.27]Alright, let me tweet this beer back.
[01:56.47]Okay.
[02:18.85]So, last night we did the Minecraft FTK experiment.
[02:24.21]And it was very much an experiment, because none of the systems were in place last night.
[02:30.63]There was still some more development time.
[02:32.09]The thing needed about, like, another... at least probably four or five days in the oven.
[02:36.74]And we just said, you know what, fuck it, let's just open it up.
[02:39.24]Let's just essentially make this stress test 2.0.
[02:41.24]Uh, stream was an hour late.
[02:43.92]And we just were like, let's fucking go.
[02:45.62]There's no permadeath, no systems.
[02:47.74]Let's just see how many people join and let's just see if we can have any fun.
[02:50.83]So, uh, it came out undercooked.
[02:52.77]Yeah, it did.
[02:53.47]And that was to be expected.
[02:55.75]Because we did a stress test the day before.
[02:58.45]But...
[02:59.88]you you can never you can never have that exact experience that you're looking for with like even like a stress test because if I go in the Discord and I'm like hey can we get like a few hundred people to connect to the server and it's like alright yeah let's go uh times that by like 50 is hard to get that uh to get that to work time's upset today I'm not upset what are you talking about
[03:24.75]I had fun last night.
[03:26.01]I mean, the whole thing was a shit show, but I think that was to be expected at some point.
[03:30.47]But that was not what that game was going to be.
[03:35.53]So I have seen a lot of people, look, I'm taking the people who have been writing about, here's what I didn't like about it, here's what I would like changed, what was up with this, what was up with that.
[03:46.12]I totally hear you.
[03:47.72]And none of that last night was what the game was supposed to be.
[03:52.32]so we're gonna put it back in the oven for like another week or two and try it again but the data that was collected yesterday was so important there's no way we could have ever had any of the data we had last night unless we had a show last night you know what I mean it's almost like you have to take like an arrow to the arm before you're allowed to
[04:19.98]You know what I'm saying?
[04:21.06]Sometimes you don't have to take an arrow to the arm.
[04:22.96]You can just dodge, but just know that the arrow's coming.
[04:26.15]You have to get an arrow shot at you first.
[04:31.05]Just dodge.
[04:34.61]Long story short, yes.
[04:36.21]There's going to be more time is what we needed.
[04:42.37]Let's move over to Jump King.
[04:47.73]I still had fun last night, and I know a lot of people did too, and I know there was some dumb shit that happened last night, and it was fun.
[04:55.30]But that was a glorified stress test too.
[05:01.08]So don't worry, that was not the game.
[05:02.64]It's not like, oh, that was it?
[05:03.80]Okay, well, that was not what he described.
[05:07.02]Don't worry.
[05:08.80]Don't worry.
[05:13.44]Jump King.
[05:15.08]There is a smokin' hot babe at the top.
[05:18.14]Okay.
[05:20.32]So this is a game... What is Other Babes?
[05:25.91]Was that even here?
[05:26.57]I don't remember that being here.
[05:33.65]Is it a porn game?
[05:34.85]New game.
[05:35.35]Alright, so I'll be playing this with the controller or is that a bad idea?
[05:44.87]No, it's fine?
[05:45.33]Okay.
[05:46.47]You've heard the legend, too.
[05:50.39]So you're gonna get that babe, right?
[05:55.92]Go on, then.
[05:57.66]Get up there.
[06:00.76]Heh heh heh heh.
[06:11.00]Is it just jump?
[06:12.94]You hold the button.
[06:14.42]It's like Luigi.
[06:15.84]Does down also do it?
[06:16.74]So it's just hold button.
[06:22.03]I get it.
[06:23.15]Alright.
[06:25.11]It's like playing pool.
[06:27.45]It's like a pool video game.
[06:28.63]You have a power and then a spot that you move the bar to.
[06:34.06]Yeah.
[06:34.44]It's like playing a video game pool.
[06:36.06]I get it.
[06:38.68]Yep.
[06:42.51]The Red Crown Woods.
[06:43.43]So this is the game?
[06:44.05]Because I can't move in the air.
[06:50.39]Whoa boy.
[06:53.10]Okay, so how do I get these ones then?
[06:57.70]And if I press right?
[07:01.25]I'm not upset, I'm fine.
[07:04.20]If I press right, how much does it go right?
[07:06.72]Does it go all the way?
[07:07.54]If I, like, hold and press right, it's, okay, it's the whole thing.
[07:10.27]It just launches you.
[07:11.95]You can't do a small left or a small right.
[07:20.25]Fuck.
[07:23.60]Okay, this is gonna be... Oh, this is gonna be something.
[07:26.92]Alright, let's go.
[07:29.10]So I have to go like this.
[07:31.12]No, like this?
[07:33.94]From here.
[07:34.96]There it is.
[07:35.26]This is like the first five seconds of the game.
[07:46.38]I'm not upset, though.
[07:47.90]You can tell.
[07:49.14]I'm laughing.
[07:50.04]That means I'm not upset.
[07:55.37]Oh, for the love of... Not upset about anything.
[07:58.69]I'm just fine.
[08:04.65]That's not one.
[08:09.16]Just not that hard.
[08:10.20]There we go.
[08:10.72]Okay.
[08:11.86]So are there checkpoints in this game?
[08:20.13]She must really be something.
[08:31.14]There's definitely, like, little safe spots, like there are in getting over it.
[08:35.05]There has to be.
[08:45.93]Alright, this is that.
[08:47.27]Once you get it down, you really get it down.
[08:48.77]Alright, I'm thinking probably from back here.
[08:53.83]Yeah.
[08:55.15]Okay.
[08:56.81]Good.
[08:58.13]What the hell am I looking at here?
[09:05.49]I have to hit... What?
[09:13.66]Okay.
[09:14.94]So I've got to get in the middle?
[09:16.24]Oh, shit.
[09:22.89]Okay, now from here... I'm going to hit my head on the ceiling, though.
[09:37.57]Alright, I'm starting to get the hang of it.
[09:40.71]Don't go too far.
[09:41.95]Don't go too far.
[09:44.20]And then, let's go... Uh... From here, and then... Hold it down.
[09:53.54]Let go.
[09:54.46]Oof!
[09:55.82]Alright, don't hit your head.
[09:58.35]Good.
[10:00.47]Alright, from here I gotta go... I gotta take this very slow.
[10:03.33]I have to go slow.
[10:14.71]And then I'm thinking, on the left side here?
[10:16.82]Yeah.
[10:19.98]It's gotta be like this.
[10:21.80]I might fall here, but it's a good attempt.
[10:24.88]No, no, I'm not gonna fall.
[10:25.84]What the fuck are you talking about?
[10:26.82]It's alright.
[10:40.50]Ooh.
[10:42.00]Ooh!
[10:43.70]Okay, easy, easy.
[10:44.60]Don't get too confident.
[10:45.48]You're in the middle of the oak tree.
[10:56.32]Oops.
[10:58.59]Alright, I had it.
[10:59.31]Fuck.
[10:59.99]I'm not mad.
[11:03.65]What was this one?
[11:04.25]Like this?
[11:05.37]Yep.
[11:05.71]Alright.
[11:05.97]Easy, easy, easy.
[11:07.87]That's not too... That's not dropping too far.
[11:09.45]It really isn't.
[11:19.17]Okay.
[11:21.51]Slow down.
[11:26.79]I had the right idea though.
[11:27.76]That's the right idea, just not as long.
[11:41.26]My man, slow down, my man, slow down.
[11:43.46]Alright, I'll slow down, I'll slow down.
[11:44.76]I had it.
[11:45.80]What am I doing?
[11:48.53]God.
[11:49.49]Okay, alright, alright.
[11:50.45]It's not even that bad.
[11:52.03]I really just fucked it up, though.
[11:53.26]Bad.
[12:03.42]Faster.
[12:03.94]Don't tell me to go faster.
[12:04.78]That's not a good idea.
[12:08.84]Oh, man.
[12:09.48]Okay, I really do have to slow down.
[12:10.80]Alright, that's fine.
[12:15.16]And then this is the long one.
[12:17.14]Don't, you dear.
[12:20.15]Okay, and then up here.
[12:20.93]Okay, then like this.
[12:23.91]Alright.
[12:33.86]How do I get through here reliably?
[12:35.90]I have to like fall into it?
[12:38.58]I got it.
[12:39.48]I got it.
[12:42.12]What's this?
[12:45.29]How am I supposed to get up here?
[12:46.25]Do I have to bounce off the wall?
[12:59.84]I think I have to bounce off the wall.
[13:09.95]Just jump.
[13:21.82]I don't have to go down from... Hold on a second.
[13:38.34]From here?
[13:46.66]Is there any music in this game?
[13:52.59]The ledge on the left?
[13:56.37]Wait.
[13:56.55]What do you mean the ledge on the left?
[14:01.91]Wait, what?
[14:05.87]You mean like over here?
[14:15.04]What?
[14:15.34]How am I supposed to get over there?
[14:17.36]That's not even a ledge.
[14:18.34]That's like two pixels.
[14:27.66]Oh.
[14:28.48]Shit.
[14:33.40]Uh-oh.
[14:34.38]Alright.
[14:35.08]Good.
[14:35.46]Good.
[14:35.78]Just breathe.
[14:36.40]Breathe.
[14:36.78]Breathe.
[14:37.12]Breathe.
[14:37.44]Breathe.
[14:37.78]Breathe.
[14:39.90]You gotta go from far away here.
[14:41.64]Look at how small that area is.
[14:43.25]I don't want to fall.
[14:45.51]Holy fuck.
[14:46.91]Okay.
[14:55.30]Save it?
[14:57.38]There's no saving.
[14:59.36]Wrong one.
[15:01.52]Why is it here, though?
[15:05.66]I can't... I don't jump from here, right?
[15:12.86]If I do a huge jump from here, will I make it to the bottom one?
[15:18.23]No, I don't think so.
[15:24.16]I don't like this.
[15:31.90]I don't like this.
[15:36.98]Oh, I don't like this.
[15:37.60]I'm a Nancy Drew streamer, guys.
[15:39.44]I don't like this.
[15:41.50]But I'm kind of addicted to it.
[15:43.59]I'm not.
[15:43.99]That's not upset.
[15:45.49]I'm not upset.
[15:46.15]I'm just stating that I don't like this.
[15:48.05]That's not me being upset about something.
[15:51.48]Look, I can go to a restaurant and order food, take a bite out of the steak and go, I don't like this steak.
[15:57.70]I don't think I'm a meat person.
[15:59.50]I don't like meat.
[16:00.78]I'm not like, die, fucking meat shithead.
[16:04.13]I hate you.
[16:05.17]Meat sucks.
[16:06.07]And like stabbing it with my knife.
[16:07.57]I'm not not doing that.
[16:08.43]I'm just simply saying I don't like meat.
[16:13.35]That's not me being upset at the meat.
[16:14.91]That's me just telling you that I don't like it.
[16:16.97]I don't want it.
[16:22.55]Stop it.
[16:24.69]Oh god, no.
[16:37.14]This ain't even like the first five minutes of the game, too.
[16:39.50]Alright, that was pretty clean.
[16:52.88]Alright, that's clean, clean.
[16:55.96]Clean.
[16:57.56]Oh no!
[16:58.36]Oh, slob!
[16:58.82]Okay, how do I get over there?
[17:12.10]Some of you guys right now are sitting there going like, oh my, he didn't even know.
[17:17.02]Just wait till he gets to the broken down helicopter.
[17:29.37]Oh, fuck.
[17:30.53]Okay, I actually got mad there.
[17:31.87]I really did.
[17:32.93]That was... I am upset about that part.
[17:35.87]You can put one down.
[17:37.39]I have to change the stream title.
[17:43.55]There's gonna be... This VOD is gonna be eight or nine different VODs.
[17:51.03]And there's gonna be a number on each one.
[17:52.91]So you're just gonna be able to skip to your favorite chapter of angriness.
[18:02.51]That's one.
[18:03.29]Actually, that did piss me off.
[18:11.31]Scroll down the VOD list and see.
[18:16.51]Oh, well.
[18:17.57]Looks like Angry 8 to Angry 9 was six minutes of two different VODs.
[18:24.21]Wow, that's interesting.
[18:27.03]He really dialed it up there.
[18:32.73]Because from one to two, it was an hour.
[18:36.58]I wonder what happened here.
[19:00.04]I'm going down to the beginning.
[19:01.46]I'm gonna go down to the beginning.
[19:12.36]Oh my god, man!
[19:19.73]I'm even slowing down.
[19:21.89]I'm even slowing down, too.
[19:32.73]I was up there.
[19:33.36]I had it.
[19:35.16]I really did.
[19:36.64]I'm doing it way too long.
[19:38.62]What the hell am I doing?
[19:48.29]That's not upset.
[19:50.02]That's me asking a question.
[20:07.00]I'm just simply asking a question.
[20:10.94]If you think it's hard now, you will not beat this game.
[20:12.98]I didn't beat Getting Over It.
[20:21.59]I got like 40% of the way through Getting Over It.
[20:24.77]And then I think I remember actually saying, why am I playing this game?
[20:30.32]Like, what do you get from this?
[20:32.92]I'm not upset about anything.
[20:33.82]I'm just asking a question.
[20:35.09]What do you gain from playing this game?
[20:40.53]Taking up a smoking habit?
[20:41.87]I don't know.
[20:42.47]I don't get it.
[20:50.88]You get gamer points.
[20:55.12]Well, I don't need any more of those.
[21:03.75]Alright, here we go.
[21:04.75]I'm gonna get through this tree right now.
[21:08.27]I already have a gamer license.
[21:09.51]Yeah, I don't need a different gamer license.
[21:12.04]I already have mine.
[21:15.20]Alright, slow down.
[21:25.95]I don't understand how that was wrong.
[21:36.66]Come on.
[21:56.40]My webcam is the best part.
[21:57.74]I don't even have my webcam on.
[22:01.28]He can't jump.
[22:02.18]Omega lul.
[22:03.46]Yes, I can.
[22:04.10]I just need to get... I gotta get used to the control system.
[22:16.61]This one is just... This one's fucking me every time.
[22:19.53]It's just fucking me up every time.
[22:23.10]You gotta be so good with that one.
[22:28.10]He sucks.
[22:36.33]This game's fucking hard, man.
[22:37.97]Dude, the Jump King is hot.
[22:50.80]What the hell are you talking about?
[22:57.60]Alright.
[22:58.00]What am I doing wrong here?
[23:02.00]I got it.
[23:02.38]I got it.
[23:02.76]Alright.
[23:02.96]Everybody can relax.
[23:03.69]I got it.
[23:32.79]Alright, I'll tell you, you know what the worst thing about playing a game like this on stream is?
[23:38.54]If I was just alone in my room and no one was watching, that doesn't bother me at all.
[23:43.88]Fall and death, whatever, that's just gonna happen.
[23:45.89]This whole game was designed for you to fall a thousand times, right?
[23:49.89]But when you're in front of a bunch of people, everyone knows you just fell.
[23:55.46]Even though, even in my mind, whatever, who cares?
[23:58.97]This is a giant microscope being pointed down at my house.
[24:02.36]There's a bunch of alien scientists looking through my window right now with a fucking microscope.
[24:16.43]God damn it.
[24:19.79]It's because you're so small.
[24:23.48]No, you know what I mean, though?
[24:24.36]It's like, if you play a game like this, you're gonna, you're gonna, it's gonna take you 50 hours to get up here.
[24:31.27]And it don't matter.
[24:31.89]You don't have any alien, you don't have aliens with telescopes looking through your window.
[24:36.79]And then they go, oh, did you just eat that one?
[24:41.21]It's just you and your Eggo waffles.
[24:51.44]Got it.
[25:10.60]Fuck.
[25:11.12]Okay.
[25:13.64]Fuck.
[25:16.62]How am I gonna get over there?
[25:19.00]How do I get to that one?
[25:21.62]How do I get to that one?
[25:22.30]How do I get to that one?
[25:23.34]How do I get to that one?
[25:25.10]Oh my god, I got it.
[25:27.12]Um, now what?
[25:30.66]All the way over to the right.
[25:32.46]But is it all the way?
[25:33.82]I'm going all the way!
[25:34.56]Going all the way!
[25:36.66]I made it!
[25:37.24]I've made it!
[25:37.74]I did it!
[25:40.44]See, right now the aliens are looking down.
[25:42.07]They're going like, I can't believe he did it.
[25:45.11]On the laser.
[25:55.63]There's no reason to watch Earth Entertainment anymore.
[25:59.87]He beat Jump King Chapter 1.
[26:11.74]Got it.
[26:14.26]Uh oh.
[26:16.14]This is a safe spot right here though.
[26:20.48]That's okay, that's fine.
[26:22.06]I'm glad I cannot fall down this unless I really fuck this part up right here.
[26:30.34]Alright, that fucking guy driving the car.
[26:33.83]The guy in the fucking car that just sped by at a thousand miles per hour.
[26:39.59]It just screamed in my ear.
[26:47.37]Fuck, man.
[26:51.09]That's so annoying.
[26:52.33]That's so annoying.
[26:55.63]Whatever.
[26:56.27]That's two.
[26:57.39]Give me a break, though.
[26:59.05]Seriously, I get to be mad at that.
[27:03.60]I get to be upset about that.
[27:04.78]That's so annoying.
[27:06.04]Somebody just screaming outside your window as loud as they can.
[27:09.72]Like somebody just threw a glass bottle at my house while I took that jump.
[27:15.60]I'll get back up there.
[27:20.07]That was the alien laser.
[27:23.76]We missed.
[27:27.62]Fuck, don't make me laugh.
[27:29.00]Don't make me laugh.
[27:32.10]Okay, please get me up there.
[27:33.24]I just want to get past chapter one.
[27:34.85]Oh no.
[27:41.05]No.
[27:42.37]This is the guy driving the fucking car, man.
[27:45.85]I'm so easily distractible.
[27:51.37]Oh, I'm so easily distractible.
[27:52.95]I'm so distractible.
[27:54.45]I get so upset.
[27:55.73]It's like so easy to like turn me around.
[27:58.73]Alright, I gotta relax.
[28:05.11]Because right now in my head, I can't stop it.
[28:07.35]I can't stop it.
[28:09.35]There's a voice in my head that continues to say, fuck that guy.
[28:13.03]What's that guy's problem?
[28:14.91]That guy's a dick.
[28:15.76]Isn't that guy a dick?
[28:17.12]Don't you hate that guy?
[28:18.30]That guy sucks.
[28:18.96]And I'm just like, yeah, that guy sucks.
[28:21.22]Oh, I have to make a jump.
[28:22.02]Hold on.
[28:22.44]Hold on, Larry.
[28:31.38]Oh, my God.
[28:35.00]Oh, my God.
[28:37.60]Oh, my God.
[28:38.13]Okay, I'm back.
[28:44.68]This one actually is... This one's a challenge, actually.
[28:47.58]It really is.
[28:49.78]Now if I just get... Okay, relax.
[28:51.26]There's no cars now.
[28:52.98]There's no speeding... Alright, just make it over here.
[29:05.05]Got it.
[29:05.45]Done.
[29:05.83]Got it.
[29:06.13]Okay, we're good.
[29:12.47]Colossal Drain.
[29:17.82]Oh yeah, but this channel point's on the channel now.
[29:20.70]If you want to redeem them, I guess.
[29:23.28]I haven't done anything to them.
[29:24.60]It's just whatever they have for default.
[29:25.76]Okay, I definitely can't... I can't stand on that.
[29:36.05]That's a tiny little... Oh yeah, yeah.
[29:42.09]Really?
[29:44.10]How am I going to...
[29:52.20]Oh, shit.
[29:56.52]Okay, do I... Is this a jump-up scenario?
[30:00.28]It is.
[30:03.28]I need some trajectory here.
[30:04.42]Alright.
[30:13.52]Oh.
[30:14.89]Oh.
[30:15.33]Alright, I haven't made a major mistake in a little bit.
[30:21.11]Yes, I did.
[30:26.90]That's... Oh, that's... That sucks.
[30:31.66]That sucks.
[30:32.86]It sucks.
[30:33.54]I'm not upset about that, but that sucks.
[30:44.39]Okay, stop.
[30:50.65]Okay.
[30:54.04]Good.
[30:55.46]Same deal.
[31:01.03]Alright.
[31:04.17]Oh no!
[31:04.99]God!
[31:05.67]Oh no!
[31:06.19]Ah!
[31:06.89]Ah!
[31:07.01]Ah!
[31:08.15]Ah!
[31:10.19]Ah!
[31:13.07]That would have been three.
[31:13.97]That would have been three.
[31:14.59]It would have been.
[31:15.37]That's not, though.
[31:19.53]Okay, I'm gonna... I don't know how long to hold for that one, though.
[31:25.68]If you're not a Geo.
[31:27.26]It's the M, too.
[31:28.21]I'm good.
[31:29.05]How are you?
[31:29.47]This game's addicting, though.
[31:45.14]That's the one problem.
[32:07.98]Thankfully, this part's very easy.
[32:10.95]This one, though, is just... I can get this one every time.
[32:16.61]But this one... Not every time.
[32:21.13]Don't you dare.
[32:25.31]Alright, let's go.
[32:33.60]Got it.
[32:34.52]Ooh, it feels so good when you get it.
[32:36.36]You know what I mean?
[32:49.26]Oh, yay, yay.
[32:50.28]Um... Let me take a minute here.
[32:56.12]So... I have to bounce off the wall, or do I?
[33:00.37]Or should I just jump straight over?
[33:01.65]Is the rain gonna hit me?
[33:04.55]Is there obstacles in the game?
[33:05.87]Is there hazards?
[33:31.15]That's not a 3 out of 10.
[33:32.31]It's not.
[33:34.53]It's not that bad.
[33:37.58]He's... Okay, now it's bad.
[33:39.10]Now it is.
[33:39.62]Now it will be.
[33:40.44]It will be in a minute.
[33:42.36]It will be here.
[33:43.18]It's gonna be in a... Oh my god.
[33:46.32]Oh my god.
[33:46.92]I'm not mad.
[33:47.40]I'm not upset about it.
[33:48.52]Oh my god.
[33:50.20]I'm just surprised.
[33:51.30]And very, very sad.
[33:53.14]I'm just surprised about what happened.
[33:56.70]Oh man.
[33:56.86]Oh man.
[34:09.01]I'm just surprised.
[34:09.71]I went too far.
[34:11.00]I went way too far.
[34:42.52]Hold it in.
[34:43.08]Hold it in.
[34:43.54]Hold it in.
[34:44.18]Hold it in.
[34:44.58]Hold it in.
[34:46.06]Hold it in.
[34:47.38]YesIsOnline gave $5,000.
[34:51.94]Gave $50 right now.
[34:53.32]Good job getting past Chapter 1.
[34:57.01]Thanks.
[34:57.57]I'll take the congratulatory $50.
[35:01.33]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[35:03.97]YesIsOnline.
[35:04.97]Thank you.
[35:09.55]Are there save points?
[35:10.27]No.
[35:15.14]That's not mad, that's laughing.
[35:22.46]It's all being bottled up.
[35:29.55]Get up there.
[35:31.15]Don't make me mad.
[35:32.57]Okay.
[35:38.89]He's evolving?
[35:39.79]No, I'm good.
[35:46.47]Okay, we're good.
[36:01.18]Okay, alright, alright.
[36:02.94]Alright, alright, alright.
[36:04.78]Alright, okay.
[36:06.66]Crisis averted!
[36:08.90]Sorry.
[36:11.10]Sorry, I sat down on a thumbtack.
[36:15.27]I'm sorry about that.
[36:16.17]Why is this on my chair?
[36:18.41]Alright.
[36:35.20]This part just sucks.
[36:36.34]I know, I know.
[36:37.92]He doesn't know.
[36:38.50]Wait till you see the broken down helicopter.
[36:40.91]I know.
[36:42.01]But from my current perspective, in the current environment I'm in right this second, this part is hard for me.
[36:48.65]No, no, no, no.
[37:01.66]I hate this jump.
[37:03.35]Because if you get this wrong, even if it's easy... Okay.
[37:15.59]Is this a Shovel Knight guy?
[37:19.22]I'm just realizing this right now.
[37:24.78]Somebody just used a channel point.
[37:28.86]What did you do?
[37:38.36]Don't, you dare.
[37:40.60]That's exactly what I thought when I saw this.
[37:42.60]Somebody said, highlight my message, pee-pee-poo-poo.
[37:47.42]That's a good use of channel points.
[37:48.86]I don't even know what they do.
[37:59.25]No!
[38:00.29]It's gotta be longer than that, but it's scary because... Don't!
[38:06.73]It's gotta be longer than that.
[38:11.93]I'm just so scared to do a jump there.
[38:13.65]Uh, Atma Starfish, thanks for five community subs.
[38:19.06]Appreciate it.
[38:20.38]Thank you.
[38:30.35]Get me over here.
[38:31.17]Come on.
[38:33.67]Alright, come on.
[38:36.77]Come on.
[38:37.84]Now I'm good.
[38:40.08]I just have to figure out what they want, what they want me to do here.
[38:43.87]AdventureMFDan, five community subs.
[38:45.63]Thank you, Dan.
[38:47.31]Thanks a lot.
[38:48.71]Both of you.
[38:51.95]Is it... Okay.
[38:56.62]Alright, alright.
[38:57.46]Okay.
[38:59.02]Now, these are gonna fall, aren't they?
[39:03.74]These are gonna fall.
[39:05.40]I'm gonna jump on them and they're gonna fall down.
[39:10.93]No, they're not.
[39:15.79]Why did that go longer?
[39:16.55]Why did that go longer?
[39:17.23]Why did that go longer?
[39:18.91]Why did it go longer?
[39:19.65]Why did it go longer?
[39:21.40]What was that?
[39:23.74]Was that one differently spaced?
[39:26.16]I'm not mad.
[39:26.58]I'm asking a question.
[39:28.06]I'm not upset.
[39:29.32]I'm just asking a question.
[39:30.54]That's just... That's like... I feel like I'm on a politics show.
[39:41.29]No, no, no, I'm not upset.
[39:42.68]I'm just simply asking a question.
[39:47.24]Like, no, you're very clearly very upset.
[39:49.18]No.
[39:56.70]Do we have more subs coming?
[40:01.91]Fitty gave some community subs.
[40:03.77]Just farming channel points and emotes.
[40:05.91]Ignore, please.
[40:08.23]Well, thank you, Fitty.
[40:21.50]Friends are fun when you hang out together and you don't get upset about anything.
[40:35.79]I almost blew that one.
[40:37.83]He's malding.
[40:38.69]I'm not.
[40:39.63]You'll know.
[40:40.87]You'll know.
[40:46.03]It's been very clear when there's been a two.
[40:47.74]It's been very clear when two and three have happened.
[40:50.84]So...
[40:57.83]Three?
[40:58.11]That's cheated.
[41:03.58]Oh, no, no.
[41:08.48]There was no three.
[41:09.12]Yeah.
[41:09.78]You guys are just like... You guys are gaslighting me to think that I had a third one.
[41:14.04]Right.
[41:23.01]Witty username thanks to the five community subs.
[41:27.61]Oh, I like this game, though.
[41:29.03]It's fun.
[41:29.57]Even though I... I'm not a big fan of steak.
[41:33.15]But if it's prepared well, I'll, you know, I'll eat it.
[41:41.55]No.
[41:42.23]Alright.
[41:42.69]My hands are... It's that spot up here that's just killing me.
[41:51.08]Because I can do this without a problem now.
[41:53.74]This area is not a big deal to me at all.
[41:56.42]As I'm very clearly showing, not making a single mistake getting up to that point.
[42:04.77]For instance, like here is fine, over here is fine, up to this one, and then over here.
[42:12.11]So as you can tell, shit, I'm just, it's just this jump here that's causing me any problems at all.
[42:19.69]Why did it go to... What happened there?
[42:21.57]What?
[42:21.89]Hold on, I hope I can put my hands down.
[42:23.13]What happened?
[42:24.17]Did my analog go the other way?
[42:27.51]Lots of community subs.
[42:28.61]The acidic vengeance.
[42:30.13]Thanks for five community subs.
[42:35.58]Okay, seriously.
[42:36.56]No, no, no, no, no.
[42:37.84]What?
[42:38.22]What happened?
[42:38.82]What's going on?
[42:43.28]I don't understand.
[42:43.80]Okay, so now I'm being dead serious.
[42:45.32]Why does... What is going... Why is that happening?
[42:48.86]I'm not crazy.
[42:51.58]I don't know why.
[42:53.01]Why would I do that?
[42:56.07]Why would I do that?
[42:56.63]Why would I get all the way up there and do that?
[42:59.75]Use the D-pad?
[43:03.42]That's adding... That's fucking it up for me.
[43:05.44]I can't use the D-pad now.
[43:06.36]I'm too used to it.
[43:10.93]What did I... I don't... I just wish I knew what was going on.
[43:13.92]Mor... Mor... Morks... Morkus Borkus.
[43:16.70]Five community subs.
[43:17.66]That's another five community subs.
[43:20.30]I'm just asking... Yeah, I'm just asking a question.
[43:25.03]Don't you guys know that as long as you tell people you're not mad, you're not mad.
[43:29.21]It doesn't matter.
[43:30.15]Because you know who you... You know yourself.
[43:34.35]And even if your face is turning bright red, I'm not upset about this.
[43:43.30]You're only mad when you actually tell people you are.
[43:48.55]Alright, now what the fuck is going on over here?
[43:51.21]Alright, I gotta use the d-pad.
[43:57.37]It's getting in my head now.
[44:00.20]The d-pad thing's getting in my head.
[44:05.07]Too long, I know, but then it was too short, it was too long, then it was... It was too long, then it was too short, then it was too long, then it was too short, then it was too long.
[44:17.46]If you're gonna do the impression, you have to raise your voice a couple octaves.
[44:22.72]No, I can't do the D-pad.
[44:32.03]Shit, I can't devolve right now.
[44:34.24]No, no, no, no.
[44:34.70]Okay, I can't.
[44:35.88]I can't just devolve.
[44:37.32]You know what I'm saying?
[44:40.94]Yeah, you know what?
[44:41.88]It's happening.
[44:42.74]And I haven't even been playing for like an hour.
[44:46.15]The controls don't work.
[44:47.43]I'm playing a dream.
[44:48.37]I'm in a dream right now.
[44:50.49]I'm pressing the buttons in the wrong order and shit.
[44:53.93]Yep, you guys know what I'm talking about.
[44:55.41]You know when you get to a point where you're devolving and I'm pressing buttons in the wrong order.
[44:58.88]I'm pressing buttons in the wrong fucking order and it's over.
[45:01.62]Somebody came over and shook me.
[45:04.15]And I'm not even actually upset about anything.
[45:07.45]I'm just devolved.
[45:08.98]God damn it.
[45:10.52]I'm fucking devolved.
[45:13.32]Alright, add it.
[45:13.96]That's three.
[45:14.88]No, that counts.
[45:15.62]It does.
[45:16.12]No, fuck that.
[45:19.42]Count it.
[45:19.74]That's fine.
[45:22.29]I actually am annoyed by the fact that... But I'm not mad at the game.
[45:28.41]okay I don't I I did I I somebody came over and hit me and they have a wrench I can't like the buttons the controls of um are foreign to me now like let right and then a or like a and then right I it's foreign to me god okay I know it's just three buttons but when they they bleed together
[46:06.47]Okay, relax.
[46:09.39]Because, like, in my brain, it's like, left then A. Or A then left.
[46:13.56]Or A then right.
[46:14.42]No, A then right.
[46:15.60]Left then A. I'm doing moving and then jumping instead of jumping and then moving the analog.
[46:21.38]And I'm just doing it backwards.
[46:23.04]I'm fine.
[46:26.40]Next up, we have... Hold on.
[46:30.08]I can't do this joke unless I have a facecam.
[46:31.86]So I can't do this yet.
[46:34.78]Maybe later, because I'm too focused.
[47:06.17]why can't I do this one now I was doing it okay stop it okay I need to no don't whoa look at how many fails 62 fails where's my cam is it even plugged in no hold on
[48:07.09]Alright, let me get this ready.
[48:23.95]This is my break time.
[48:48.88]This is, uh, so what are you talking about?
[48:57.05]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back to Around Politics, where we talk about politics, we go over all the things in politics.
[49:04.81]Joining me now via satellite, who claims he is absolutely not angry at all.
[49:10.22]Via satellite from Las Vegas, Nevada, we're going to get the state of his political party.
[49:14.26]Sherman 985, are you with us?
[49:17.98]Yeah, yeah, Bob.
[49:24.91]What are the questions?
[49:32.56]Just have a few of those myself!
[49:53.65]Why is your face so red?
[49:54.59]We're talking about.
[49:56.85]I didn't tell you I was angry.
[49:57.89]I was just coming on the show to answer a few questions to give you some of my own.
[50:09.70]He's so livid.
[50:18.30]Mega milk.
[50:19.04]What is that?
[50:30.09]Stop.
[50:33.25]Stop.
[50:35.12]Oh, yeah.
[50:35.42]Ladies and gentlemen.
[50:36.84]Ladies and gentlemen.
[50:37.88]Hold on a minute here.
[50:38.72]I'm getting word.
[50:39.74]Oh, what's that?

[50:50.10]Ladies and gentlemen, if you are wearing a white shirt with blue sleeves on it, just getting the word right now.
[50:58.33]then you have to absolutely be referencing, what am I getting on my desk here?
[51:02.45]You absolutely have to be referencing some fucking weird anime shit, apparently.
[51:07.21]Yes, anytime you wear a blue-sleeved t-shirt.
[51:59.01]I don't know.
[52:00.39]Alright, let me at least get through chapter two.
[52:05.53]We're just having some fun today.
[52:11.55]What?
[52:12.33]Where am I?
[52:13.09]Where am I?
[52:13.51]Where am I?
[52:14.03]Where's my character?
[52:14.67]What happened?
[52:15.49]How did I get over here?
[52:16.07]Is this a secret?
[52:17.95]What happened?
[52:25.99]Yes?
[52:26.77]What do I do about this?
[52:28.77]Can I get anywhere from here?
[52:29.89]I think I have to go back up.
[52:40.07]Go down.
[52:44.24]What the fuck?
[52:47.90]I didn't know there were illusory walls in the game?
[52:50.68]What?
[52:52.12]Okay, now that I know that, that
[52:56.53]That doesn't really help me though.
[52:57.51]This kind of makes it harder.
[53:03.38]Why would I do that?
[53:04.38]That makes it harder.
[53:13.94]I just like burped and acid went up into my throat.
[53:20.98]Is that me being mad?
[53:22.00]That's my body being mad, right?
[53:25.91]Or I think that's my hernia.
[53:27.91]I think that's just a symptom of hiatal hernia.
[53:30.97]Yeah, I think so.
[53:31.71]Okay.
[53:32.97]So no, then no, that doesn't matter.
[53:39.71]That's five?
[53:40.56]Alright, I was up there so much.
[53:46.44]I just gotta get back to what I was doing.
[53:48.16]Just back to where I was.
[53:53.89]Holy shit, I almost just blew that.
[53:56.17]No, no, no, no, don't go straight down.
[53:58.14]Oh man, I had it too.
[54:02.08]I'm sitting at the roulette table.
[54:04.88]And I put a thousand dollars on like red 21.
[54:08.80]And it landed in the space next to it.
[54:12.92]So I was like, that's like, that's, that's $35,000.
[54:16.76]I had it.
[54:17.40]I mean, it was right there.
[54:19.04]I thought, you know, it'll happen again if I do it again.
[54:36.31]Okay, slow it down.
[54:41.41]Take a minute.
[54:43.08]That's Vegas humor.
[54:44.98]Stop.
[54:45.26]Why did I even read chat?
[54:46.28]What was the point of reading chat?
[54:47.26]Why did I look over?
[54:48.36]Why would I look over there?
[54:49.52]What would I look over at chat for for that reason?
[54:51.88]At that moment?
[54:52.44]Why would I do that?
[54:54.04]There's no reason for me to look over at the chat room when I'm in the middle of holding down a jump.
[55:04.11]Like, I'm just asking to lose.
[55:07.79]There's no reason to do what I just did.
[55:14.84]I'm not mad about this, I'm just stating a fact.
[55:44.15]Mad... Quiet.
[55:50.05]Quiet.
[55:59.84]Good.
[56:01.64]Good.
[56:03.18]Good.
[56:03.48]Now get over it.
[56:06.38]Alright.
[56:07.22]It took me long enough.
[56:08.00]No, just... No, that... It's something about... There's a bug in the game.
[56:11.58]There's a bug in the game.
[56:12.22]There has to be a bug in the game.
[56:13.02]There's a bug in the game.
[56:13.60]There's a bug in the game.
[56:14.12]There's a bug in the game.
[56:14.64]There's a bug in the game.
[56:15.18]That spot right there, there's a bug in the game.
[56:16.99]That's the third time that's happened.
[56:17.97]It's the only time it's happened the entire time I played the entire game for an hour.
[56:21.27]That's the only time that's happened.
[56:23.19]It's only in that spot.
[56:24.41]Why is it only in that spot?
[56:25.27]It makes no sense.
[56:26.15]That's the only time that's happened.
[56:29.39]Like, I'm trying to get that to happen right now, and it won't.
[56:35.52]You understand?
[56:36.50]Why?
[56:38.31]Why is that the only spot where that happened?
[56:41.35]Let's bug in again.
[56:46.14]Five.
[56:47.08]Maybe.
[56:52.34]I'll put it to the judges.
[56:53.32]We'll see.
[57:13.41]Get outta here.
[57:14.87]Is this a British Bake Off?
[57:21.23]These judges need to determine if he was actually angry or not.
[57:25.03]Ooh, alright.
[57:36.64]Now what?
[57:42.78]What's up here?
[57:47.66]I did it!
[57:47.98]I made it to, like, the shop.
[57:49.36]Okay, there's a shop right here.
[57:50.78]Now what?
[57:59.74]I did it!
[58:06.48]I'm so scared to do this.
[58:13.16]Oh, look at this next part.
[58:14.80]Look at this next part.
[58:26.49]False king's keep.
[58:29.91]This doesn't look that bad.
[58:31.07]You're right.
[58:31.91]It really doesn't, as long as I slow down.
[58:33.13]Hmm.
[58:37.67]I mean, that's... I think that's what I have to do.
[58:44.71]Yep.
[58:58.47]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[58:59.31]It's not that bad.
[58:59.93]It's not.
[59:00.21]Get the bird.
[59:00.77]Get the bird.
[59:01.21]No, I don't care about the bird.
[59:02.93]Why would I get the bird for?
[59:05.68]I'm not getting the bird.
[59:06.78]You want to go get the bird.
[59:11.72]Why would I do that?
[59:16.39]Just to get the good ending.
[59:17.29]Alright, the judges have determined that I was actually upset.
[59:32.62]Oops, I didn't mean... Okay, I meant to change it to 20.
[59:34.68]I don't...
[59:41.35]I meant to change it to 20.
[59:43.41]Yeah.
[59:43.97]I guess I leveled up.
[59:45.25]I guess I got more... I leveled up.
[59:49.21]Every time I go another floor, I get another 10.
[59:51.92]I leveled up.
[60:10.30]No, stop.
[60:11.34]Okay, just do what I was doing.
[60:25.17]Every time you fall down, you lose.
[60:26.83]No, that's not how it works.
[60:28.39]You don't take levels away, you just gain levels.
[60:33.60]You don't de-level in any video games.
[60:38.67]In what video game do you de-level for doing poorly?
[60:41.33]No, you just get stronger.
[60:46.82]How's that wrong?
[60:47.46]You de-level.
[60:56.04]Okay.
[60:57.50]Don't be stupid.
[61:07.23]These little jumps...
[61:09.49]Make me want to go to the dentist.
[61:13.12]And have them just drill without a novocaine.
[61:14.90]Am I mad?
[61:15.54]No?
[61:29.77]No.
[61:30.19]Okay.
[61:31.23]No, you're just a psycho.
[61:32.43]Okay, that doesn't mean I'm mad.
[61:34.63]How am I going to get up here?
[61:43.54]I have, wait, what?
[62:31.70]see I know I know all you guys are secretly rooting against me that's the thing you know what I mean I I I know it I know it's like I'm the bad guy I'm the I'm the guy that comes out during the wrestling event that knows he's gonna get booed when he comes up I'm the heel of this stream you want to see me fall you want to see me fall down
[63:11.68]These little jumps are making me giggle.
[63:15.92]Okay, stop.
[63:17.16]Stop, stop.
[63:17.94]I will actually fuck this all up.
[63:22.55]That's not mad.
[63:23.71]You guys have been around this channel for long enough to know what that actually means.
[63:32.35]Right?
[63:32.49]You guys are just waiting for someone to open the door and hit me in the back of the head with a fucking chair.
[63:37.54]You know how many PogChamps would happen if a guy in a speedo came in the back door here?
[63:42.59]And just smashed me in the back of the head with a fucking folding chair?
[64:19.20]Oh my.
[64:21.26]Oh my.
[64:26.57]Don't do it.
[64:27.13]I'm going to try to see if I can get to the next level.
[64:55.30]I didn't make it.
[64:56.40]I fell.
[64:56.77]Why is the audio so bad?
[65:09.34]When was this video uploaded?
[65:13.98]This video was uploaded two years ago.
[65:16.79]Why does it sound like a cell phone video?
[65:30.35]There are a lot, like can I just say, there are at least like three or four very large viewed WWE best chair shots.
[65:50.90]This is happening to me.
[66:07.43]I Was reacting oh dude oh What the oh
[66:33.22]Holy shit, those are brutal!
[66:34.70]I wasn't mad, I was reacting to the video.
[66:45.35]You know, you do something enough times that you probably have to figure out that it's not what you're supposed to do.
[66:52.57]I think I've hit that moment right now.
[67:02.34]No, you don't go that way.
[67:06.32]Gorilla Master's out.
[67:09.57]Is it mad if I tell that person to shut up?
[67:13.35]For spamming another streamer's stream in here?
[67:22.47]No, that's not mad.
[67:27.28]Okay, slow down.
[67:30.40]Now I gotta go from here to there.
[67:34.54]And then, damn, how am I going to get from here?
[67:37.73]Oh, that's such, that's, that's very, very, very difficult.
[67:40.39]That's very, very, very difficult.
[67:50.60]I can beat this?
[68:04.57]Oh man, oh man.
[68:05.61]Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man.
[68:24.44]Oh, this is hard.
[68:26.66]How do I get this one?
[68:30.06]Oh, that was close.
[68:31.39]That was very close.
[68:37.05]Man, that was close.
[68:39.88]Why did I hold it for that long?
[68:41.02]Okay, slow down.
[68:42.50]Get the bird.
[68:43.56]Okay, fine.
[68:46.32]No, I'm not getting the bird.
[68:47.44]I don't care.
[68:54.22]Don't, don't, don't.
[68:55.16]Don't get bird.
[68:55.72]Alright, I'm not going to get the bird.
[68:58.26]I don't even have the confidence to get the bird.
[69:00.00]I don't even have the confidence to go up this way.
[69:06.28]I'll have confidence.
[69:07.02]I will.
[69:13.06]There'll be that moment where I play You Say Run.
[69:32.58]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[69:34.65]I almost would rather fall down the whole thing than have to go up, because I'm just seeing this on repeat and it's killing me.
[69:48.03]Alright, god, get...
[70:05.33]Alright.
[70:06.01]1, 2, 3, go!
[70:08.15]No.
[70:08.93]No.
[70:09.61]No!
[70:10.39]No!
[70:11.29]No!
[70:13.32]No!
[70:14.80]That one is too hard.
[70:17.86]I'm gonna make a Steam review.
[70:19.34]And it's gonna say, I like the game a lot.
[70:22.10]It's very fun.
[70:23.40]But some of the jumps just feel like they're unfair.
[70:31.22]And I would know.
[70:33.60]Because...
[70:35.41]I have- I'm gonna write seven paragraphs about this game and all the things that I don't like about it, and how it's stupid and how I don't like it, uh, with .2 hours in-game.
[70:56.54]I'm gonna have a full Steam review about all the things I didn't like about it, and I may have not even gotten past the menu screen.
[71:10.84]I gotta try this.
[71:12.62]No, what a mistake.
[71:13.48]It's fine.
[71:16.96]Oh, it's this... I don't know what it is about this.
[71:19.56]I don't know what it is about this one.
[71:20.88]I just... I'm stuck here.
[71:21.78]I'm stuck.
[71:23.28]I'm just stuck in this one.
[71:25.74]Thank god I can't fall.
[71:27.06]I said I would rather fall, but no, I don't.
[71:29.14]Imagine if I had to come up here and do this all over again just to get to the top to miss that jump like five times.
[71:34.35]No, no, no.
[71:35.13]I don't want to do that.
[71:44.56]Okay, now what do I do?
[71:47.12]Should I jump up to the right?
[71:53.00]Don't click link.
[71:54.78]What do you mean, don't click link?
[71:58.13]I have to go left?
[71:59.27]No, I don't.
[72:02.29]I'm not clicking the link.
[72:03.29]I'm not clicking the link.
[72:04.01]Are you guys about to get, like, banned?
[72:07.63]Why did I jump this way?
[72:10.14]I have to jump this way.
[72:12.29]No, I don't.
[72:12.75]What's going on?
[72:14.25]Do I?
[72:14.55]Oh, no.
[72:29.18]Click the link.
[72:38.08]Get that fucking link out of here.
[72:40.13]Get that link out of here.
[72:41.49]Get that link out of here.
[72:43.57]Get that.
[72:47.21]Get the link out.
[72:50.51]Get that.
[72:50.93]I don't want to see that link again.
[72:57.31]Get rid of that.
[72:57.87]Somebody just posted it.
[72:58.63]Ban that person.
[72:59.89]Right there.
[73:00.17]Ban them.
[73:01.13]Good.
[73:03.41]I saw another one.
[73:03.89]Ban.
[73:04.83]Good ban.
[73:06.16]Ooh.
[73:12.67]Alright, a lot of people are getting banned right now.
[73:19.54]Watch out!
[73:20.86]Ooh, that one was in the mouth.
[73:22.20]Alright, that person's not going to be back for like four hours.
[73:24.58]Oh, shit.
[73:26.62]Banned in the mouth.
[73:27.78]Alright, what happened?
[73:39.56]Oh, I did it.
[73:40.00]I actually did it.
[73:41.58]I did it.
[73:42.02]I'm going to do it again.
[73:42.70]Oh, my God.
[73:44.20]I had it.
[73:44.68]I had it.
[73:58.65]No.
[73:59.43]No.
[73:59.70]Ladies and gentlemen, via satellite, let's see how he's doing.
[74:02.70]To discuss all politics.
[74:06.80]Larry Stevenson.
[74:18.87]I'm okay.
[74:19.43]I'm not red.
[74:20.53]I might have been red for a little bit.
[74:21.89]I'm all the way down here now, though.
[74:35.36]Okay.
[74:36.20]It's not that bad.
[74:40.92]You want me to get the chairs?
[74:52.97]Alright, guys, so I guess the Toronto Blue Jays need a new uniform.
[74:58.48]Toronto Blue Jays have to have all new uniforms now because they're the milk team.
[75:09.59]No, that counts.
[75:10.23]That does.
[75:10.87]Yeah.
[75:12.37]That counts as two.
[75:30.17]The Toronto... I don't even want to say this out loud, but how fucking stupid would that be?
[75:35.59]If they were the Toronto Mad Megum.
[75:40.88]That would be so stupid.
[75:44.28]Ow.
[75:45.16]Ow, that hurt my back.
[75:46.26]The Toronto... Imagine having to fucking say that as an announcer.
[75:55.77]How embarrassing.
[75:58.15]I can't say it out loud.
[75:59.59]I refuse to say it out loud.
[76:00.87]I don't even know what it is!
[76:02.11]I don't even know what it is!
[76:04.33]Why would I just talk about something that I don't know anything about?
[76:12.18]Fuck.
[76:12.54]Okay, I need to relax.
[76:16.16]Here's your Toronto!
[76:18.86]Your Toronto!
[76:21.24]Mega!
[76:27.53]Everybody just screams, cheers.
[76:29.35]Alright, stop.
[76:34.35]I have to do this right.
[76:38.13]Why does everything have to be funny?
[76:40.01]You know what I mean?
[76:40.72]Everything is funny.
[76:41.80]Why does everything have to be so funny?
[76:45.78]Jerma, why do you laugh so much?
[76:47.12]I don't know, because everything's funny.
[76:49.32]What am I supposed to do?
[77:04.84]Thank you, Bible Black, for the five community subs.
[77:08.72]Thank you, Bible.
[77:11.20]Appreciate it.
[77:17.04]What?
[77:17.96]That's apparently the funniest thing I've ever seen.
[77:20.50]What?
[77:21.18]Why is that so funny?
[77:23.65]What happened?
[77:32.88]Google it.
[77:33.46]No.
[77:34.32]Thanks for the subs though, appreciate it.
[77:46.15]No!
[77:49.19]Okay, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[78:04.27]You guys are an absolute menace.
[78:06.41]I didn't say it either.
[78:07.16]Alright, I keep having trouble with this shit.
[78:16.71]This one, that jump right there is one of the hardest.
[78:19.79]I read the Steam review.
[78:20.59]I remember them saying that part right here is the worst.
[78:32.48]Uh, nondescript civilian, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[78:35.87]10.
[78:37.25]Just dropped right now, thank you so much.
[78:39.17]Appreciate it.
[78:44.71]50 subs?
[78:45.03]What are you talking about?
[78:46.63]When?
[78:48.79]Dude, Pog, what?
[78:50.20]He said that.
[78:51.14]Oh, I don't know.
[78:53.38]How am I supposed to differentiate between what you guys have for, like, porn usernames?
[78:56.46]I don't know.
[78:59.08]Am I supposed to know the title of every porn ever invented?
[79:03.68]How am I supposed to know that?
[79:05.14]How am I supposed to do that?
[79:16.28]Yes.
[79:22.18]Damn it.
[79:24.66]Oh, nah, this one sucks.
[79:26.53]And I gotta do- I'm not-

[80:39.87]Oh, fuck!
[80:48.50]Go right, go right, go right, let me go right.
[80:50.24]I can't make that, right?

[80:59.64]Holy shit, I can... Oh my god, I was gonna get... I was gonna jump on the left.
[81:10.45]What is this?
[81:14.65]Shop?
[81:16.41]Greetings.
[81:19.29]These boots are fit for a legendary hero.
[81:23.55]Crafted by a distinguished master.
[81:25.41]With these, you'll get to that babe in no time.
[81:28.54]Upgrade?
[81:28.76]Upgrade?
[81:30.38]Since I like you, I'll cut you a deal.
[81:34.26]For only one measly coin, they are yours.
[81:38.46]What do you say, eh?
[81:40.58]Yeah!
[81:41.94]You don't have one coin.
[81:43.09]Afraid the price point is at the bare... It appears there aren't many other customers around.
[81:53.29]You don't happen to have any rich friends.
[81:58.08]It's the bird.
[82:16.84]I'm ready.
[82:18.90]The bird is right here.
[82:20.83]Is it right below me, or is it to the left?
[82:23.29]The bird with the gold coin.
[82:25.01]Wait, what?
[82:25.41]Everyone thinks I'm insane.
[82:26.33]No, I didn't just, like, fall off the edge for no reason.
[82:28.67]I'm coming to get the coin.
[82:30.45]It's all the way to the left edge, right?
[82:41.96]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do!
[82:46.14]Oh, yeah!
[82:47.22]Oh, yeah!
[82:48.60]Yeah!
[82:49.68]Oh, yeah!
[82:50.65]Alright, I'm, like, pumped up right now.
[82:57.05]Like, don't fuck it up.
[83:05.62]I'm losing it.
[83:06.80]I'm losing it.
[83:07.60]I'm losing it.
[83:09.54]Nah.
[83:10.50]You think I'm losing it?
[83:12.08]I lost it a long time ago.
[83:22.57]Nobody tell him.
[83:36.69]That's a level up, by the way.
[83:37.59]No, it's not.
[83:40.87]I didn't make it.
[83:41.55]No, I didn't.
[83:42.35]I technically did make it.
[83:44.63]Didn't I?
[83:48.57]Yeah, you don't go back in levels.
[83:49.91]I know some of you guys are like, well, I play on a modded... I play on a modded Wildstar server, and we have negative levels.
[83:57.85]I don't play that.
[83:59.42]I don't do that.
[84:07.62]Alright, my body's like a lightning rod right now after getting that goddamn bird coin.
[84:11.24]I gotta relax.
[84:23.79]Wait a minute.
[84:26.15]I can just jump that whole thing.
[84:27.79]Alright, cool.
[84:28.39]I love when you find something out about what you're doing.
[84:31.13]I love it.
[84:33.53]You didn't get it.
[84:34.21]It took it.
[84:34.91]It flew it away.
[84:35.55]What do you mean it flew it away?
[84:36.71]What are you talking about?
[84:39.91]I didn't get the coin.
[84:45.67]There we go.
[84:46.09]I should have done that from the beginning.
[84:47.17]What do you mean I didn't get the coin?
[85:06.22]No, I have it.
[85:06.88]I should, right?
[85:14.71]Where's this shop?
[85:15.95]Right here.
[85:18.41]Give me that coin.
[85:19.61]I got it.
[85:23.55]Never slip with these expert coins up there.
[85:36.09]Give me that thing, you little shit.
[85:44.52]How do I get over there?
[85:51.02]Do I have to... Oh my god.
[85:55.08]Did I get it?

[86:44.40]Oh god, I didn't mean to do that.
[86:45.80]Okay, you gotta go way lower than that.
[87:00.07]Okay.
[87:02.07]Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[87:05.97]Okay, let's see.
[87:06.62]What is this?
[87:07.10]What's this image that I'm going to be very, very mad at?
[87:10.26]PogChamp.
[87:10.80]Look at the picture.
[87:11.32]PogChamp.
[87:12.98]Yeah, that's funny.
[87:16.40]Yep.
[87:17.14]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[87:17.66]I got a t-shirt I like.
[87:19.37]I can't wear this ever again.
[87:20.51]Oh, shit.
[87:27.49]Okay.
[87:31.93]Oh no.
[87:33.35]I have to try.
[87:33.92]Oh.
[87:38.96]What the fuck was that?
[87:58.28]I can never wear that shirt again.
[88:00.76]Thanks, guys.
[88:11.63]He's seen it already.
[88:12.53]Yeah, that was after TwitchCon.
[88:14.93]I have seen it already.
[88:20.36]You should thank us.

[89:06.08]Thank you for your cooperation.
[89:07.28]They're just, they're slowing me down.
[89:18.86]Okay?
[89:19.42]Do you understand why would I do something like that?
[89:21.94]That's what I'm saying.
[89:22.78]Why would I do that?
[89:23.90]Why would I go that way?
[89:25.32]What would I do that for?
[89:26.02]Shit, that's gonna be fucking odd.
[89:47.42]That's gonna be hard to do, man.
[89:49.40]It's gonna be hard.
[89:51.31]No, no, no, please don't go all the way down.
[89:53.83]Okay, slow down.
[89:54.83]I actually have to take a break.
[89:55.91]Like, I have to take a mind break.
[90:04.53]Jerma is mega bad at this.
[90:06.33]You guys are getting channel points too quickly.
[90:07.73]I'm gonna have to slow that down.
[90:17.85]I was told to speed it up.
[90:30.10]He's still not going to give me the fucking coin?
[90:33.00]Where do I go from here?
[90:45.57]I can't tell.
[90:46.13]Do I have to not up right?
[90:49.39]No.
[90:49.45]To the right?
[90:55.19]Can I land on that?
[90:59.73]Oh my god.
[91:00.99]Oh my god.
[91:03.00]Oh my god.
[91:04.14]I almost didn't.
[91:05.20]Okay.
[91:05.66]Oh my god.
[91:08.88]Again.
[91:09.72]I'm telling you something's wrong.
[91:12.82]My heart hurts right now because of that.
[91:22.30]And then what, we go, huh?
[91:24.55]I have to go through the middle?
[91:39.39]What the fuck, man?
[91:48.16]Fucking dumbass controller.
[91:49.64]I swear to God.
[91:51.91]Why would I ever intentionally do something like that?
[91:54.87]What would I do that for?
[91:56.11]Like, just jump the wrong way on purpose?
[92:00.47]No, this thing sucks.
[92:03.19]Alright, yes, yes, yes.
[92:04.63]I know, I know.
[92:05.37]Go ahead, add it.
[92:06.53]Go ahead, keep a tally.
[92:07.55]That's fine.
[92:08.34]Hold on.
[92:09.10]Hold that thought.
[92:13.00]Why didn't I just use the D-pad from the very beginning?
[92:15.58]I can't even use it now because it's too...
[92:24.66]Okay, everyone relax.
[92:25.48]I got it.
[92:25.76]I got it.
[92:26.00]I got it.

[92:28.92]He did it.
[92:29.22]He's done it.
[92:29.68]I did it.
[92:29.98]What are you doing?
[92:32.06]Funny Discord lane.
[92:32.92]We stopped.

[92:56.30]Okay, I can fucking jump into walls and stuff.
[92:58.80]I'm safe in here.
[93:03.27]That one's going in the folder.
[93:05.81]There's the coin again.
[93:06.71]How am I gonna get that coin?
[93:30.60]How am I gonna do this?
[94:35.94]Sorry.
[94:42.60]I can't... I can't... I can't... I can't get the coin.
[94:46.00]Is the coin that necessary?
[94:48.45]And do I actually get the damn thing when I... How long does it take?
[94:51.93]I fall so far if I miss this.
[94:54.99]That's too far to fall.
[95:04.52]What?
[95:11.52]What the hell is this?
[95:29.41]Bright Crown Woods?
[95:39.84]Snow?
[95:40.40]I can't walk.
[95:47.84]Oh, man.
[95:48.52]This sucks.
[95:53.63]You need snowshoes.

[96:22.85]Even if you succeeded, she would refuse you.
[96:28.32]I know this.

[97:13.03]Um... Uh... Okay.
[97:15.77]Okay.

[99:33.35]It's alright.
[99:33.67]It can be salvaged.
[99:34.63]No.
[99:35.03]And they do it.
[99:36.69]They put it there.
[99:37.98]They put it there specifically because it's going to drop you all the way back.
[99:40.54]And they know what they're doing.
[99:42.44]They just dump you all the way fucking back here.
[99:46.33]It's not that far.
[99:47.17]It really isn't.
[99:48.47]It just looks like it is.
[99:55.67]It just looks bad.
[99:57.16]It's okay.
[99:57.56]I'm still back here.
[100:07.26]Okay, we're good.

[100:56.94]I don't understand.
[100:57.94]I almost want to turn- I'm gonna try to turn on like a hand cam on so you can see what- because you guys can be- Doesn't hand- doesn't a hand cam imply I know what I'm doing?
[101:15.47]For you to see like just how fast I press the buttons?

[101:28.20]I'm not... Okay, I need this is... I gotta get through this.
[101:49.86]I'm close to tilting.
[101:51.41]I am close.
[101:52.27]I'm not going to let it happen, though.
[101:55.21]Because once it happens, it's over.
[101:57.15]I feel like I'm making some decent progress, so why would I just go full shake the pinball machine, you know what I mean?
[102:12.50]Yeah, I'm making some pretty good progress.
[102:23.67]That was close It's hard it's scary cuz every jump could be your last He's crying
[102:52.65]I started every one of these to be my final job.
[102:55.45]Stop making jokes and play.
[103:09.62]No more joking around.
[103:10.32]I'm trying not to, but sometimes it's... That's how I cope with this kind of shit.
[103:22.28]It's okay.
[103:22.82]It's okay.
[103:28.43]No.
[103:28.79]Too much.
[103:29.35]Too long.
[103:41.31]Okay.
[103:43.99]Okay.
[103:44.17]I just had to get somebody to get hit in the head with a chair.
[103:45.79]I think I'll be alright now.
[103:58.05]This is a psycho.
[103:59.99]Actual psycho.
[104:09.37]This game looks easy.
[104:10.35]No, stop.
[104:13.48]Get outta here.
[104:16.46]This game looks easy, man.
[104:22.74]I can't, okay.
[104:23.90]Honestly, I did this part 5,000 times already.
[104:36.18]I'm just laughing about watching the undertaker hit somebody in the head with a chair to calm down.
[104:41.18]Yeah, guys, sorry.
[104:48.94]I just kind of need to relax.
[104:50.36]I just gotta watch him to get hit in the fucking head with a heavy object.
[104:56.75]That really just makes me comfy.
[105:07.63]Is that a real picture?
[105:08.71]I don't know.
[105:18.90]Sure.
[105:19.60]This is real, I guess.
[105:25.36]Alright.
[105:26.70]Do you ever look in the mirror and you really think that you look like this sometimes?
[105:37.19]I swear to God.
[105:39.01]There's been times when I've looked in the mirror just like kind of like I'm getting ready like maybe when I'm gonna go out or something.
[105:45.52]I feel like I look like this in the mirror sometimes.
[105:48.32]It's like weird.
[105:57.57]Imagine how big your brain would be though.
[106:03.97]You would be so smart.
[106:07.75]That's a brain that's two or three times... Oh, what if it was just skull only?
[106:13.03]The brain is the same size, but the skull is just four times as big.
[106:24.67]Or is this just how my head has hardened because of how many times I've been hit in the head with a chair?
[106:36.47]Lots of calcium.
[106:41.64]Alright, hold on.
[106:44.76]I almost just lost, but it's okay.
[106:46.78]This part really actually sucks, so hold on.
[106:51.48]No, fucking come on, man.
[106:53.08]Come the fuck on.
[106:55.90]Come the fuck on.
[106:56.96]Come on.
[106:57.97]Come the fuck on.
[107:00.15]Come on.
[107:01.11]It's just so easy to fuck that up.
[107:03.73]Okay.
[107:06.87]It's so easy to fuck that one up.
[107:08.99]It's a tiny little window.
[107:15.08]I'm not mad.
[107:16.24]I'm just spitting facts.
[107:31.35]He's spitting on us.
[107:32.59]I'm not spitting.
[107:34.14]Nobody said that.
[107:34.90]Why did I just say that?
[107:36.68]Oh my god.
[107:37.18]What am I doing?
[107:43.06]What?
[107:43.50]How is that wrong?
[107:44.30]Huh.
[107:58.72]The little ones are the worst because you just don't know.
[108:02.04]It's hard to determine what a tiny jump is.
[108:04.46]You have to do it for such a small amount of time.
[108:06.84]But at the same time, you have to still hold it down long enough to do it.
[108:10.72]It's like a... You know what I'm saying?
[108:11.88]Too much jump!
[108:12.28]Make 18.
[108:12.60]No, 17.
[108:14.05]Whatever it is.
[108:34.03]Just let it out.
[108:34.67]I just did.
[108:43.31]Did this guy fart on stream?
[108:45.69]How disgusting.
[108:46.99]You know how bad channel... I have to delete channel points.
[108:52.18]You guys can now get my attention.
[108:55.40]Insanely easily.
[108:56.52]By having this bright highlighted text.
[108:59.04]That I'm guaranteed to read.
[109:00.82]Guaranteed.
[109:01.90]Guaranteed to read it.
[109:04.68]All senior citizens should have life alert.
[109:07.95]I'm guaranteed to see it.
[109:09.07]Guaranteed.
[109:21.28]But what happens when people just only chat with channel points?
[109:26.32]There's no more regular chat.
[109:28.56]All I see is channel point chat.
[109:41.99]If everyone's using channel points, then nobody... I'm reading chat again.
[109:46.33]I'm not reading chat.
[109:48.05]Until I get to the next area.
[109:51.94]What does it say?
[109:52.66]Alright, how many... Look, look, I gotta ask you a question.

[112:43.73]I can't get over it.
[112:45.00]Okay, stop.
[112:46.42]Stop.
[112:46.98]This is not even... Look, I'm not... This is not bad.
[112:48.96]This is mania.
[112:50.69]No, it's not.
[112:51.55]I'm fine.
[112:52.35]I'm fine.
[112:54.45]You've seen way worse.
[113:10.87]You stupid motherfucker.
[113:12.13]I swear.
[113:12.48]Okay, that counts.
[113:13.98]I gotta be careful.
[113:14.66]I'm getting close.
[113:17.00]I'm at 18.
[113:17.32]I have to level up?
[113:23.74]I gotta level this shit up quick?
[113:26.86]No more?
[113:27.26]I can't make this jump.
[113:30.48]It's actually impossible.
[113:31.24]I have to do that instead.
[113:48.25]I'm good.
[113:49.37]I'm good.
[113:49.75]I know I'm up against an unfair point system.
[114:04.46]Yes, I know.
[114:04.98]I'm aware that I created this point system.
[114:07.20]That doesn't mean it's fair.
[114:11.80]Alright, come on.
[114:17.46]Good.
[114:17.86]Now let's get back on track.
[114:22.82]This is the part that always fucks me up.
[114:55.89]Sorry, I couldn't breathe there for a second.
[115:24.46]I don't want to do this again.
[115:31.32]Please just get up here.
[115:39.38]What the fuck are you doing?
[115:41.97]I'm just asking a question.
[115:42.93]What are you doing?
[115:46.67]I just have one simple question.
[115:56.25]No, I just have... How do we join each other's TVs?
[115:59.67]That's not 19.
[116:16.00]That's not 19.
[116:35.90]I don't remember, is it?
[116:36.88]What the hell is going on?
[116:38.20]Come on.
[116:44.88]What is going on?
[116:46.04]Somebody's calling me.
[116:51.95]Wait, what's this weird ringtone?
[116:57.29]I don't understand how we're on each other's TVs.
[117:13.14]Guys.
[117:22.09]No.
[117:22.25]Alright, I seriously might have to... I might have to just... I'm not done streaming.
[117:28.12]Of course.
[117:28.50]I'm not even at 20 yet, yo.
[117:30.38]I'm not even there yet.
[117:32.66]Oh, good.
[117:45.29]I'm gonna mess this up.
[117:46.29]I've had so many chances and I keep blowing it and I'm doing it so wrong.
[117:53.45]Holy shit, I can't believe I'm still getting these chances.
[118:01.28]I need to see... Okay, it's that way.
[118:07.58]Got it.
[118:10.52]Okay.
[118:10.62]Okay.
[118:17.20]Oh, fuck off with this.
[118:20.09]Okay.
[118:38.36]But now what?
[118:39.84]I have to bounce off the left one or off the right one?
[118:44.30]Off the left one or off the right one?
[118:45.90]Off the left one or off the right one?
[118:47.66]Off the left one or off the right one?
[118:50.78]Off the left one?
[118:51.46]Oh boy.
[118:55.07]I get 10 extra points, by the way.
[119:01.49]This is a new zone.
[119:12.70]I don't think it's possible for me to get... I don't know.
[119:34.00]I have this, like, theory.
[119:35.18]Where sometimes you just, like, you just have to go for it.
[119:39.46]You just have to... You just have to stop talking...
[119:43.44]Figure out what the heck you're doing on somebody else's TV.
[119:46.99]And get over there.
[119:47.81]You know what I'm saying?
[119:50.83]Like... I think Reed's gonna be your undoing.
[119:58.43]I need the coin, though, to get the special boots.
[120:00.41]That's the whole purpose.
[120:16.72]Oops.
[120:18.61]This dude doesn't even have boots.
[120:20.25]Omega lull.
[120:22.21]Yeah, you can omega all you want.
[120:27.10]You can omega all you want.
[120:30.34]You can omega lull all you want.
[120:33.26]Not gonna change my theory.
[120:46.74]Don't you fucking dare.
[120:49.74]Yeah, that counts.
[120:51.46]That counts.
[120:55.10]You know, I have some leeway here.
[120:57.46]I have some... Fuck!
[120:59.94]Okay.
[121:00.94]I got one out.
[121:15.83]I have enough points.
[121:45.61]Look at how hard this jump is.
[121:47.01]Are you kidding me?
[121:49.29]How do you get that?
[121:51.81]It's gotta be perfect.
[121:53.39]And how do you get back?
[121:58.05]I was trying to get the coin, but I missed.
[122:06.91]It's too small.
[122:07.93]I'm not getting the coin.
[122:08.98]I don't care.
[122:16.10]I got the coin! I got the coin! I got the coin! I got the coin! I got the coin!
[122:22.16]I got it!
[122:29.24]Yes, I was just a Disney side character.
[122:32.42]during one of their important end-of-the-movie missions, where I comically go pick up the item that needs to be picked up, and somehow I end up with it.
[122:40.61]And, like, you didn't expect the little squirrel fuck to have the coin.
[122:45.14]You thought it was gonna be the big main character.
[122:47.28]No, it's me.
[122:48.06]I got the coin!
[122:48.66]I did it!
[122:48.92]I got it!
[123:01.68]Left side's probably easier.
[123:04.13]Oh, Jesus.
[123:07.49]Oh, Jesus.
[123:08.09]Oh, Jesus.
[123:14.37]Holy Jesus.
[123:19.98]Oh, Jesus.
[123:20.72]I almost just screwed that all up.
[123:22.76]Geez.
[123:23.22]Alright, now from here, I gotta go.
[123:26.16]Um, what?
[123:26.89]What?
[123:37.33]I don't have to jump from here.
[123:38.45]I can't, that's not possible.
[123:41.41]A left bounce will not do anything for me.
[123:45.83]Do I actually have to go right?
[123:53.90]Well, this sucks.
[124:05.11]Use coin for boots.
[124:05.87]I didn't get the coin.
[124:12.32]I don't have a coin.
[124:14.50]The bird flew up, didn't it?
[124:15.50]I don't have the coin.
[124:21.50]What are you guys on about?
[124:22.29]Oh, no.
[124:27.99]You gotta go way shorter than that one.
[124:29.53]There we go.
[124:36.49]And then up.
[124:38.75]Careful, careful.
[124:40.45]It's a little too long, it's death.
[124:45.16]See what I mean by that.
[124:46.08]Ayayay.
[125:00.00]Jesus.
[125:01.93]And then we gotta go from here, we gotta go just jump left.
[125:05.63]All the way.
[125:06.07]Okay.
[125:07.59]Okay.
[125:12.98]I didn't want to jump that way with my computer.
[125:15.54]Something wrong with my computer.
[125:23.73]I had it.
[125:24.25]Fuck you.
[125:25.61]I had it.
[125:27.23]God.
[125:31.30]Okay, you don't understand.
[125:32.74]I'm turning on a fucking hand cam.
[125:35.98]I'm turning on a fucking hand cam.
[125:37.46]Seriously, like that's so...
[125:43.72]I like... I'm turning the hand cam on.
[125:47.64]Eventually.
[125:48.18]Not right now.
[125:59.37]No!
[126:03.20]No!
[126:03.30]Okay.
[126:04.02]Everything's fine.
[126:21.86]I SWEAR TO GOD I'M TURNING IT ON!
[126:24.33]I'M TURNING IT ON!
[126:36.08]How are we even gonna do this?
[126:48.31]Is this even possible?
[126:50.23]This is not possible without, like, a mount.
[126:53.09]I don't have a mount, guys.
[126:57.60]And I have to, like, put my hand in the screen?
[127:01.82]That's not gonna work.
[127:03.54]Tape it to my forehead.
[127:04.72]Just mount it.
[127:07.56]I don't have... Mount it what?
[127:08.75]On my teeth?
[127:14.19]Look, all you need... Here's what we're gonna do, okay?
[127:17.88]All you need is just the thumb anyways, so not like this fucking matters.
[127:22.78]There's no way I can really reliably do this.
[127:24.90]Hold on.
[127:25.26]Let me get my camera.
[127:30.51]You just need the thumb.
[127:35.59]So I'm going to go like this.
[127:37.65]No, this is not going to work.
[127:38.99]This is uncomfortable.
[127:39.70]This is uncomfortable.
[127:46.07]This is so this is so shitty I'm gonna try though.
[127:51.07]I got like long ass fingernails, too.
[127:55.40]This is like disgusting This just looks gross I don't like this this looks gross You just need to see Alright, I'm almost ready
[128:16.51]You just need the thumb.
[128:22.17]I'm trying to get it in a spot where it's going to be at least comfortable for me to play the game.
[128:26.18]Put it between your... Nope, not reading that.
[128:34.58]Okay.
[128:35.92]You can see that now.
[128:49.11]Hold on.
[128:59.86]Can you see?
[129:00.38]Look at how like fucking dirty this is.
[129:08.86]This is so dirty.
[129:10.68]I just cleaned it too.
[129:11.82]Hey remember that alien microscope?
[129:19.32]Okay, can you see now?
[129:31.15]You fucker.
[129:35.39]It's lying on my lap right now.
[129:53.41]This is all you need to see.
[129:55.75]I'm ready.
[130:00.17]See?
[130:01.04]Look at that fingernail.
[130:02.06]God damn it, it's disgusting.
[130:03.72]It's disgust- No, it's not.
[130:05.16]It's fine.
[130:07.54]It's fine.
[130:10.66]It's fine.
[130:11.46]Just pretend it's not even- It's-
[130:23.70]It's... It's this.
[130:25.86]I can't play like this.
[130:26.82]No, I don't care.
[130:27.34]Un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un
[131:00.15]Why would I use the stick?
[131:01.99]Because I'm a moron.
[131:03.95]And when the game first started, I started using the stick, and I got so used to the stick that when I went to the D-pad, I couldn't do it.
[131:11.42]And it was freaking me out.
[131:12.74]I'm just a stick user now.
[131:17.68]Did you see the new Gorillaz movie?
[131:19.06]No, I didn't.
[131:19.96]Okay, wait a minute.
[131:24.46]Okay.
[131:24.90]Oh my god.
[131:25.82]No.
[131:26.30]God.
[131:26.66]I was up there.
[131:27.52]I was up there.
[131:28.20]I actually was up there.
[131:30.02]And I did the like, look at my hands thing!
[131:31.94]And it's... Look at my hands, guys!
[131:36.37]Cool, huh?
[131:43.69]If I didn't balance the fucking webcam in between my legs, I would still be up there.
[131:56.33]And now all the way down here.
[132:12.47]Yeah, can we get, like, an actually mad counter?
[132:14.75]Okay, I'm gonna put it in brackets.
[132:16.67]How many, like, actually, actually angry?
[132:47.00]Just once?
[132:47.62]Yeah, I think.
[132:51.26]We'll tally it up at the end.
[133:03.56]Come on, that was in there, it was in there.
[133:06.78]What was wrong with that?
[133:19.13]Finally, finally.
[133:21.18]You know the game gets harder, right?
[133:23.40]Oh, I know.
[133:25.30]That's fine.
[133:27.88]Hey, I've made it this far.
[133:33.10]I've made it this far.
[133:56.09]Okay.
[133:58.55]Get me up there.
[133:59.27]Let's go.
[134:02.07]Let's go.
[134:04.32]Let's go.
[134:04.80]I don't get it.
[134:10.41]I don't understand.
[134:11.23]I don't get it.
[134:13.03]How do you do that?
[134:16.81]How do you do that?
[134:19.19]How do you do that?
[134:24.02]And give me a break.
[134:39.60]That's a huge channel point message.
[134:41.44]What the fuck?
[134:41.90]What?
[134:49.93]No.
[134:55.35]No.
[134:55.89]You!
[134:56.39]You!
[134:56.65]You!
[134:56.95]You!
[134:57.23]You!
[134:57.53]You!
[134:57.85]You!
[134:58.15]You!
[134:58.47]You!
[135:03.70]Mad?
[135:04.18]No.
[135:06.00]No!
[135:14.18]Okay.
[135:15.44]Wait, just, what am I doing?
[135:17.92]What am I doing?
[135:18.50]Why am I trying to jump to this?
[135:20.92]What the fuck am I trying to get on this little Tetris platform for?
[135:25.78]What was I doing?
[135:27.17]What's wrong with me?
[135:28.43]What?
[135:35.79]Okay.
[135:42.13]I got the coin.
[135:42.71]Got it.
[135:43.57]That's all I care about.
[135:44.17]This is safe, right?
[135:59.50]Um... I don't know.
[136:02.28]Up on the... Like, on that?
[136:09.13]And then over.
[136:13.89]Okay, now what?
[136:17.55]Fuck yeah, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[136:20.02]Yeah, here we go.
[136:23.74]That's the play.
[136:25.88]That's the play.
[136:35.23]That's the play right there.
[136:52.82]Oi!
[136:53.52]Ho ho!
[136:54.68]Mickey?
[136:55.10]Oh!
[136:56.46]Dr. Phil!
[137:05.91]That wasn't Dr. Phil!
[137:32.83]Oh no!
[137:34.35]Stop making me laugh.
[137:36.25]Stop making me laugh.
[137:37.89]That's worse than being mad because when I laugh, I'm like... When I'm mad, I just lock in and go...
[138:06.37]Shit.
[138:07.81]Oh, man.
[138:08.81]Oh, man.
[138:09.65]I'm almost at the top of the mountain.
[138:11.83]Almost at the top of the mountain.
[138:18.20]Hmm?
[138:20.90]A fellow jumper.
[138:22.82]How unusual.
[138:26.02]I salute you for coming this far.
[138:29.88]But I'm afraid this is the end of the game.
[138:32.76]Thank you for completing Jump King.
[138:35.99]Just wait until you see what is ahead.
[138:40.61]Pepe face.
[138:42.01]I will wait here.
[138:47.75]Cool.
[138:50.02]How do I get out of here now?
[138:58.82]I don't know why I thought that was gonna work.
[139:14.38]This is not too terrible.
[139:16.51]It can be very quickly, though.
[139:17.67]Like that.
[139:28.70]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[139:52.28]That wasn't angry, that was terrified.
[139:55.18]Oh no.
[140:10.75]Too far.
[140:11.17]Don't go too far.
[140:11.91]Okay, not bad, not bad.
[140:16.08]Now clean it up.
[140:23.96]Clean it up, Jeremy.
[140:24.98]Clean it up.
[140:25.76]Clean it up or I will punish you.
[140:28.02]Clean it up or I will punish you with some terrible 80s theme song from a cartoon.
[140:45.68]You had it, too.
[140:46.56]Just don't move.
[140:51.67]I'm so paranoid to jump too far.
[141:00.43]I keep having it.
[141:02.23]It's like I have no confidence that I'm gonna land on it, so I just turn.
[141:07.23]And now I went over it.
[141:09.21]Oh, good.
[141:09.95]Good job.
[141:11.31]Hey, excellent work, man.
[141:13.87]Hey, you going to the party later?
[141:16.63]Party with the fucking idiots?
[141:24.16]That counts.
[141:25.34]Yeah, it does.
[141:41.29]How is that a Sans voice?
[141:45.82]Sans.
[141:48.04]Why is everybody that talks like this gotta be Sans?
[141:50.94]No, it could be a bunch of different characters.
[141:54.02]Like Barney Rubble from Flintstones.
[141:56.40]That's the original Sans, eh?
[142:00.68]A guy that wears a leather jacket in any live action movie or TV show from the 90s or the early 2000s.
[142:13.60]Yogi Bear?
[142:14.42]Oh yeah, he was the original Sans.
[142:15.98]All you have to do to do Yogi Bear is instead of you just elongate the end of your words.
[142:23.06]It's pretty easy to do.
[142:45.51]Sheesh!
[142:53.87]No!
[142:54.57]Okay, stop!
[142:56.53]Stop.
[142:56.97]You have to stop.
[143:00.16]I need to find a new area before this game turns off.
[143:07.81]Stop, stop, I'll fall.
[143:09.83]I mean, I'll fall if I don't... Okay, see, I knew I was gonna... I'm right now... Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[143:21.43]This is... I cannot let this happen.
[143:24.16]I was doing pretty good, actually, until... I don't even remember.
[143:28.32]What happened?
[143:31.00]I started doing, like, cartoon character voices for some reason.
[143:42.06]There we go.
[143:49.94]Oh my god, Jeremy.
[143:51.64]You're gonna get punished.
[143:52.88]It's time to get punished.
[143:53.60]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[144:04.75]You deserved it.
[144:05.39]You deserved it.
[144:11.08]You deserve like ABC Mouse songs.
[144:15.16]You deserve the four hour long put your baby in front of the iPad children's music channels.
[144:36.57]no please no please yeah actually that would be me punishing you but you don't deserve to be you don't deserve that okay alright alright alright seriously this is the one wipe my hands of the oil like my body just has oil come out of it
[145:30.38]You just want to go so fast when you fuck it up.
[145:34.36]You want to go so fast when you just fuck it all up.
[145:36.38]You know what I mean?
[145:38.41]It's just human nature.
[145:40.33]You screwed it up.
[145:41.09]Go harder.
[145:41.61]You lose.
[145:42.05]Go hard.
[145:42.55]Go more.
[145:43.05]More.
[145:43.79]More.
[145:44.17]More.
[145:55.66]Okay.
[145:55.96]I stopped.
[145:56.34]Stop.
[145:56.66]Stop.
[145:56.88]Stop.
[145:57.12]This is the point where you have to stop.
[145:58.93]Because when you hit... I would say this area down here, where I am lying right now, face down on the ground.
[146:05.28]This is... If you tilt it and you're just out of control.
[146:09.76]You stop, pause it immediately.
[146:11.38]Because after this is when it all goes to shit.
[146:20.19]You know what I mean?
[146:21.29]If I keep going like... Then I'll turn the stream off.
[146:24.09]Because that'll count as like 10.
[146:31.50]get your bearings if you come down this far you get your bearings do it again see it's always in that spot every time that spot every time the analog I just I'm biting my mouth right now to make sure I don't scream
[147:10.36]He's blaming the controller.
[147:11.42]Well, why would I hold right?
[147:14.30]You know what I mean?
[147:14.98]Why would I ever do that?
[147:18.52]Well, it looks like I need to jump to the left because there's not even a platform on the right.
[147:22.53]I think I'll hold right.
[147:35.31]There's a wall over there.
[147:37.58]Hold right.
[147:49.78]And like, you know what?
[147:51.12]When you start getting, uh, no, count this, because this is, this is what happened.
[147:54.60]Yeah, count this.
[147:56.08]Seriously, count it.
[147:57.29]Because, uh, the cord of the controller just touched me.
[148:03.95]And I was like, get the fuck away from me.
[148:05.75]Like, get the fuck out of here.
[148:06.99]Get away from me.
[148:07.69]I moved it out of the way hard.
[148:12.85]It's like, the cord is pissing me off.
[148:16.00]It hasn't for the last almost two hours and a half.
[148:18.04]You alright?
[148:20.25]I touched my leg and I was like get the fuck away from me and when you know when you start to get angry at things touching you that are not that inanimate objects that are just then that's when alright I'm good
[148:45.02]Alright, I just gotta get to another area before I have to... I'm at my last two.
[148:50.83]Yeah, that won't happen.
[148:53.21]I'm just gonna be quiet.
[148:57.29]If I'm quiet, you guys won't even know if I'm upset about something.
[149:03.69]Take a break and play getting over it.
[149:05.07]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[149:16.10]Okay.
[150:06.72]Shit.
[150:10.78]Fuck.
[150:15.37]Okay.
[150:17.19]This game is nothing else.

[150:20.21]This game's nothing else, man.
[150:23.51]Am I high?
[150:24.24]What the fuck am I talking about?
[150:40.59]That's alright.
[150:41.73]I act like I've been here for like ten hours.
[150:43.31]It's been two and a half.

[151:28.46]Oh, no.
[151:28.77]Sorry.
[151:29.11]Sorry.
[151:29.27]That was a piece of chicken in my mouth.
[151:31.23]I had a piece of chicken stuck in my teeth from like six hours ago.
[151:55.24]Chicken in teeth, goblin nails.
[152:01.52]What do you guys think I'm like, I just get, go grab a chicken in the woods and like go on all fours and like.

[153:37.15]Speaking in tongues.
[153:39.37]What a strange thing, by the way.
[153:41.13]Can we just, like, address that?
[153:43.91]What is that even supposed to mean?
[153:48.57]What is speaking in tongues?
[153:50.46]I don't get, like, what is that?
[153:53.10]You just kind of go off and do, like, Adam Sandler gibberish, right?
[153:58.16]What's the difference between... That's what I'm thinking.
[153:59.84]Is that the right...
[154:09.06]Yeah.
[154:09.34]It's like... That's Adam Sandler speed.
[154:12.42]That's the same thing, right?
[154:37.82]By the way, up for probably best actor of the whole year.
[154:41.48]I know I've said this before and I'll say it again.
[154:43.14]Everyone's like, oh, hey, you're the Adam Sandler of Twitch.
[154:45.26]And it's like, oh, LOL, LOL.
[154:48.53]Oh, really?
[154:48.93]That guy's up for probably an Academy Award this year for being the best actor out of any actor in the whole year.
[154:54.93]Good, compare me.
[154:56.07]That's a growl.
[154:56.65]Take that comparison any day of the week.
[155:04.69]And the thing is, people just can't believe it.
[155:06.43]People just can't stand it.
[155:08.17]It's like they're being shown something that they're like, no, no, no, no, it can't be.
[155:11.91]No, Adam Sandler.
[155:12.99]Adam Sandler sucks.
[155:13.91]No, no, he can't.
[155:14.79]No.
[155:18.53]Okay, please.

[155:45.45]It can't be.
[155:48.25]I burnt my copy of Attack of the Pixels, whatever the hell that movie was.
[155:53.72]He can't win!
[156:08.07]Alright, I gotta pay attention again.
[156:11.71]Adam Sandler is nominated for literally nothing.
[156:14.37]Go look up the movie Uncut Gems.
[156:17.55]And you'll see.
[156:30.44]There are no Oscar nominations yet.
[156:34.72]There's no nominations yet.
[156:35.94]What are you talking about?
[156:40.75]the Oscar buzz is around that he's going he will be nominated for his performance in uncut gems okay can I please just get this jump before I start to have a little bit of a problem I'm gonna have a okay okay okay okay
[157:02.95]Video games suck.
[157:04.23]Video games suck.
[157:05.39]Video games suck.
[157:06.53]Video games suck.
[157:07.85]All video games.
[157:08.70]None of them are fun.
[157:09.48]All of them suck.
[157:10.30]All video games suck.
[157:11.74]I'm never playing a video game ever again.
[157:28.41]Hey, the last good video game I played was Doom back in like 86.
[157:32.18]They haven't even come close to another good one.
[157:36.85]Alright.
[157:58.00]By the way, how dare you fucking doubt Adam Sandler?
[158:00.51]That's what happened.
[158:01.55]That doesn't count as getting mad.
[158:02.87]I got mad about Adam Sandler and people thinking he doesn't deserve it.
[158:05.63]So that made me angry.
[158:06.55]Not the video game.
[158:07.81]All video games aren't fun.
[158:09.41]But, I mean, we already know that.
[158:11.81]It's the Adam Sandler thing that threw me off.
[158:43.62]Why would I stop playing this game?
[158:44.76]I'm having fun playing this.
[159:07.80]Wow, I'm having a fun time.
[159:12.77]Look, I got back up here.
[159:13.71]Look at that.
[159:14.31]That's not that bad when you know everything.
[159:16.87]See, I'm good.
[159:18.49]Next person that says anything bad about Adam Sandler, I'm getting rid of their channel points.
[159:24.36]Oh no, not my channel points.
[159:26.00]I need those.
[159:38.84]We're good.
[160:03.24]I knew that was going to be a problem.
[160:04.20]I hadn't done it in a long time.
[160:07.45]I hadn't done that one in a very long time.
[160:09.57]If I can get up there, though, I'm not going to let it beat me.
[160:11.67]You know what I'm saying?
[160:13.19]I'm in this still at least chapter three.
[160:23.53]He's evaporating?
[160:24.98]I'm fine.
[160:29.96]If I was truly evaporating, you would know.
[160:35.91]I knew this one was going to be tricky.
[160:38.79]There it is.
[160:39.87]There it is.
[160:42.09]There it is.
[160:42.71]Alright, boys and girls, we're back.
[160:53.59]It's like it never happened.
[160:58.99]Look at that.
[160:59.43]We're back.
[161:01.38]I could have just, like, malted and had new skin.
[161:04.18]No.
[161:04.78]New shell, whatever the hell you want.
[161:06.00]I'm back.
[161:09.45]It's okay.
[161:10.59]It's been a while since I've been up there.
[161:11.53]We're fine.
[161:17.45]When was the last time you guys had a chocolate malt?
[161:22.61]I'm talking, like, actual chocolate, like, malt.
[161:25.03]Not, like, a milkshake.
[161:26.01]A chocolate malt.
[161:28.67]Can you even still get those?
[161:33.38]No, it's okay.
[161:38.40]There's some specialty places that do it still.
[161:40.00]I don't think I want one right now.
[161:42.09]Is that weird?
[161:44.69]That was in the middle too.
[161:45.67]It was pretty close.
[161:51.51]The thing about a chocolate malt that's strange, I don't know why I want it.
[161:54.25]It just tastes like a gross sour milkshake, but I want one.
[162:10.95]That looks like it's going in, man.
[162:27.76]This jump actually sucks.
[162:31.07]It just does.
[162:31.97]And I know all of you are sitting there going like, yeah, fuck that jump.
[162:50.89]It actually is really easy, scrub.
[162:52.71]Ban that guy for life.
[163:02.60]Those of you that might be new to the channel, a lifetime ban on this tool, that's not true.
[163:05.75]That's me making that up.
[163:09.25]I don't want to be like, a lifetime ban is five minutes.
[163:13.27]That's not true.
[163:14.67]You can very, very, very much get banned from this channel for life.
[163:18.96]So don't think that that's reality.
[163:58.97]That was funny fuck it was funny, so I fucked it up No too far too far too far man too far slow it Come on
[164:32.39]tell you one thing I'm so glad that I had like a full lunch before playing this game I would have been gone like 30 minutes 30 30 minutes 30 minutes ago I would have been gone I would have been gone 30 minutes ago if it weren't for that steak and cheese sandwich I had earlier I would have been gone 30 minutes ago what am I doing

[170:28.76]This is the equivalent of eating hot peppers.
[170:33.62]Why would you do that?
[170:34.62]Why would you put hot sauce on everything?
[170:37.12]Oh, yeah, let me put some hot sauce on my eggs.
[170:42.32]Oh, that's a lot.
[170:42.92]That's a lot of hot sauce.

[172:07.81]Where, in a lot of these games, people have competitions as to how much hot sauce they can fucking eat in a row.
[172:14.58]Give me that bottle.
[172:19.28]I'll chug that fucking thing.
[172:23.21]Okay, I did it.

[180:50.61]He's doing it, Pepe.
[180:51.69]Pepe, look, he's doing it.
[180:52.87]Pepe!
[181:08.81]He's back!
[181:31.96]Oh man.
[181:33.14]Oh no, I'm not.
[181:34.50]Oh god, that sucks such asshole.
[181:37.58]That sucks asshole.
[181:41.67]I just gotta get this pixel perfect Jump King.
[181:45.53]And I have to do that stupid ass tube shot again.
[182:02.15]Oh, this is fantastic.
[182:04.61]Yeah, cool.
[182:05.29]You know what the worst part about this is?
[182:14.28]I'm way the fuck up there.
[182:19.26]But I somehow fucked it up.
[182:22.18]And now I can't even get back to like six screens above where I am.
[182:33.74]That's just, come on.
[182:36.04]I've done this like 600 times.
[182:39.39]I can get up here.
[183:26.41]You fucking piece of shit.
[183:28.95]You piece of shit.
[183:32.61]There's no fucking way.
[183:38.65]Seriously, how do people- how do we play these games?
[183:43.36]You know what I mean?
[183:45.78]How do we do this?
[183:47.08]How do we do this to ourselves?
[183:50.26]Have we gotten so bored as a species that this is entertainment to us?
[184:05.61]Jumping and falling down a hole?
[184:08.77]For three hours straight with a controller in your hand, jumping into holes?
[184:14.84]Super Mario is rolling over in his grave right now.
[184:18.88]That's right, he's dead.
[184:21.56]He's been dead.
[184:30.97]Super Mario, they've just, it's CG now, guys.
[184:37.59]Mario's been dead since 1997.
[185:09.55]What does this say?
[185:11.10]I'm a certified backseat gamer.
[185:12.94]No, I don't... I'm not upset at anybody here.
[185:16.38]What?
[185:19.50]I'm having a blast.
[185:21.44]I really actually am.
[185:22.44]This is like fun to me.
[185:28.50]Stop.
[185:29.16]I just have to get out.
[185:29.80]I'm sick of seeing this stupid ass town.
[185:33.99]Just... Just... This is the one.
[185:36.83]Right here.
[185:37.79]Okay.
[185:39.63]Don't fuck it up again.
[186:11.93]and and what is wrong with that what I'm doing don't go that far
[186:38.47]Don't- don't go to- I haven't updated the MAD meter in a while.
[186:41.28]What are we at, like fucking 20?
[187:44.65]Oh shit!
[187:46.07]Oh shit!
[187:50.58]I just jump scared you?
[187:51.52]I'm sorry.
[187:54.48]I don't mean to be like this.
[187:57.28]I really don't.
[188:13.03]He sounds exasperated.
[188:16.32]Uh, maybe a little.
[188:21.25]That one's hard to judge.
[188:22.89]That one's hard to judge.
[188:35.06]Oh, fuck.
[188:35.60]That's hard to judge.
[188:36.52]That's the one I'm going to have trouble with this whole time.
[188:38.50]That one is so difficult to judge.
[188:43.81]You know what, I'm gonna stand all the way in the back in the jump?
[188:46.06]That's an insane jump.
[189:03.57]No, come on.
[189:22.07]I was expecting a skinny person to beat this game.
[189:24.31]What on Earth are you talking about?
[189:44.50]Quick jermaOn A5 poll, do you guys think I'm gonna beat this game?
[189:57.88]What if I do, though?
[189:59.60]What if I did?
[189:59.98]I want at least... There's 6,600 people watching right now.
[190:13.14]I want at least 2,000 of you to guarantee me that if I beat this game, then I get... If I complete this game,
[190:26.44]then I get at least two Nancy Drew streams.
[191:31.72]This sucks.
[191:35.18]But I'll get Nancy Drew Streams out of this.
[191:37.59]I have to try.
[191:38.31]Like, are you kidding me?
[191:41.27]What a pog moment that would be.
[192:06.70]Wait a minute.
[192:07.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[192:17.03]I'm trying to get the coin, guys.
[192:18.51]I'm trying.
[192:31.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[192:42.86]What is... I... Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

[192:49.29]Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy.
[192:51.51]Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy.
[192:52.83]I did the thing.
[192:54.97]I did the thing I needed to do and I... I exhaled all of my energy and I fell off the mountain.
[193:02.63]You know what I mean?
[193:03.23]I just... Oh, fuck.
[193:05.99]Oh no, fuck.
[193:07.85]No, I fucked up everything.
[193:10.27]I literally fucking got the dumb coin and then like, fucking deflated.
[193:16.23]Oh, fuck me.
[193:20.66]Fuck me.
[193:22.18]Fuck me.
[193:23.10]Fuck me.
[193:23.88]Fuck me.
[193:24.64]Fuck me.
[193:27.90]Forget me.
[193:28.88]Forget me.
[193:29.96]Fuck.
[193:33.13]Fuck.
[193:34.17]Fuck.
[193:34.77]I was there and I was up.
[193:36.48]I got the coin.
[193:37.40]Fuck the coin.
[193:38.44]I don't care about the true ending.
[193:39.70]I don't need to read the back of the hot sauce label to know the game is fucking hot.
[193:44.73]I don't care.
[193:45.49]Why do I care?
[193:57.81]You have to get that coin so you get the true ending.
[194:00.78]By the way, it's probably three lines of dialog at the end credits.
[194:07.23]Oh, okay.
[195:31.10]Cheers to you.
[195:31.80]No, cheers to you doesn't work anymore.
[195:34.14]Cheers to you doesn't work.
[195:34.88]It only worked on the last boss in Dark Souls 3 DLC.
[195:37.66]That's the only place where it's usable.
[195:42.68]Give me a goddamn break.
[196:14.35]How many times have I tried this?
[196:15.41]Well, Kim, I've fallen down 340 times.
[196:19.69]And I've jumped 3,657 times.
[196:21.59]So I fell down.

[199:00.81]No.
[199:02.27]It's actually fucking me up.
[199:08.71]All I hear in the background, in my brain, is somebody behind me playing a piano.
[199:13.35]I've just stopped playing the piano.
[199:28.68]It's a great song, but not right now.
[199:39.34]Oh my fucking god.

[200:00.58]Now I can stream again.
[200:17.00]I had it too.

[203:09.06]You got to go accept the award now.
[203:10.37]Oh, I'm not ready.
[203:10.93]Yes, you are.

[205:43.37]It's so fucking hard.
[205:57.00]I bet you if I played Super Meat Boy after this, I feel like I would probably have won 100% every single level.
[206:03.67]You know what I mean?
[206:05.89]Where do we go from here?
[206:08.75]How do you top this?
[206:09.47]Where do we go from here?
[206:12.16]Are we, like, just pull your teeth out, put it in your CD tray, and it'll, like, determine if you ripped out your teeth or not?
[206:18.21]What's the next step?
[206:30.93]Sounds like a new genre.
[206:42.68]you gotta just jump back around yeah yeah yeah this is I ain't gonna try to jump on that one from here
[207:25.06]What do I do?
[207:28.79]What do I do from here?
[207:29.63]I have to get on that one on the right?
[207:34.23]Go up?
[207:34.69]I can't.
[207:37.31]Go left.
[207:38.21]I can't go left.
[207:40.15]Pull.
[207:40.47]You have to pull over here on the right.
[207:42.03]I know, but this is going to be hard.
[207:49.37]Go right there?
[207:49.93]I know.
[207:50.25]I know.
[207:50.81]Right and then left, but this is going to be tricky.
[207:57.61]Oh my god!
[207:58.46]Oh my god!
[207:59.02]This one's tricky!
[208:01.22]Oh my god!

[208:08.87]I made it to Windswept Bluff!
[208:10.45]That's a- that's a-
[208:28.91]This wind.
[208:49.84]Stupid crow for the fucking one line of dialog at the end of the game.
[209:00.87]Congratulations.
[209:02.35]You got the coins.
[209:04.91]Who gives a shit?
[209:08.71]Oh my god.
[209:09.55]It's actually fucking ridiculous.
[209:16.78]But, don't you know?
[209:18.74]That'll be on your Steve Achievement list.
[209:24.26]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[209:30.01]I haven't opened up my Steam achievement list in seven years, guys.
[209:32.70]I don't even know what's on there.
[209:51.89]Let's check it.
[209:53.19]Let's check it.
[209:58.66]I don't even know where it is.
[210:02.09]Oh man, I'm so- but I have to get the coin, right?
[210:05.89]I can't.
[210:08.28]I can't do it.
[210:09.34]Somebody- I'm about to look up what happens if you get all the coins.
[210:19.47]I'm just gonna go over the whole thing, I think.
[210:21.97]No, you can't.
[210:25.59]Less than 4% of people have beaten this game.
[210:40.50]So 4% of everybody that's bought this game has not beaten it.
[210:45.36]No, no, other way around.
[210:46.23]Other way around.
[210:55.14]The thing about those statistics is
[211:09.55]One fucking goddamn mistake, and you do it all over again.
[211:15.54]One tiny little fucking tiny pixel of a mistake.
[211:20.64]Can't wait to rip my teeth out in 2060.
[211:22.98]I got this new game!
[211:27.66]Yeah, it's called Rip Out Your Fucking Teeth!

[211:46.86]Oh, dude.
[211:48.52]What's that mean?
[211:49.26]I don't know what that word means.
[211:50.58]We're so stupid in the future.
[212:08.96]I'm not getting the coin.
[212:10.54]I'm not, you know, I know I'm not capable of it.
[212:13.92]I'm not capable of getting that coin.
[212:15.40]You all know it.
[212:16.84]And I know a lot of people are gonna be like, no, dude, you might be, just like... You sure?
[212:27.80]You sure?
[212:29.97]Oh my god.

[212:34.61]10 out of 10 in, like, what the fuck?
[212:40.72]Oh my god, and I have to do that all over.
[212:43.10]Welcome to the beginning of the fucking game.
[212:44.94]Oh my fucking god.

[214:33.40]Okay.
[214:34.72]I can't even.
[214:35.86]I can't do it.

[216:06.75]Uh, let me buy like fucking checkpoint gems and place them.
[216:12.81]That's the new meta.
[216:20.08]$1.99 for each checkpoint gem.
[216:23.52]They would make a hundred million dollars.
[216:31.84]How much would I buy?
[216:33.42]As many as I could afford to wipe out my bank account.
[216:46.02]I would get a call from the bank.
[216:49.60]Sir, it says here that you'd like to spend $1,600 on, am I getting this right, checkpoint gems.
[217:02.88]Are you sure your son doesn't have the iPad?

[217:58.76]It's like, I know there's mustard on my shirt.
[218:01.18]I know because I opened, it squared it all over my shirt.
[218:05.07]I have a huge ass mustard stain.
[218:07.01]You don't have to point at it and say, hey, you got a mustard stain on your shirt, huh?
[218:12.78]Yeah.
[218:13.54]Yeah, I do.
[218:14.66]I was here when I did it.
[218:16.32]And I'm embarrassed about it.
[218:17.22]Thanks for bringing it up.
[218:28.38]At my own wedding, even.
[218:30.08]You're gonna talk about the huge mustard stain all over me?
[218:43.42]Oh, man.
[218:49.04]Fucking goddamn molting them right now.
[218:53.75]I don't even remember.
[218:54.37]You know, like, I don't even remember half the words I've said this stream.
[218:58.64]You could play back something, and I wouldn't even know what I... I wouldn't... I would say it wasn't even me talking.
[219:07.26]Dog shit.
[219:07.94]I remember dog shit, because I fell down and bounced, like, three times.
[219:14.61]I remember saying that there was dog shit... Yeah, like that.
[219:17.37]Except I did that...
[219:23.97]How are we in each other's TVs?
[219:28.31]You know, I remember that one too.
[219:37.17]And I'm like not even making progress anymore.
[219:39.71]All because of the dumbass coin that doesn't fucking do anything.
[219:48.59]It just is there.
[219:49.79]It's only there for you to blow your run.
[219:53.42]That's the only reason why it exists.
[219:55.43]And I know it's going to be some like, oh, you really wanted that coin.
[219:58.31]Well, chasing the coin was the detriment the whole time.
[220:01.93]You didn't even need the coin.
[220:03.07]You don't even need those boots.
[220:04.25]The coin was the fucking variable that you don't need the boots to win.
[220:09.54]You had it in you the whole time.
[221:04.70]I can't find it, never mind.
[221:07.78]Is he smoking crack?
[221:10.66]Nope.
[221:21.73]How did we get here?
[221:22.55]How did we get here?
[221:25.21]I was up all the way.
[221:27.59]How did I get here?
[221:32.51]How did we get here?
[221:35.82]You're supposed to go up.
[221:39.08]You're absolutely shit at this game.
[221:40.38]Go play Nancy Drew.
[221:41.28]It's your pace.
[221:42.50]Apparently everyone's shit at this game.
[221:44.84]Because only 4% of people have completed it.
[221:47.57]So, by that logic, if there's 6,500 people right now, only 4% of you guys are any good at this.
[221:54.63]What's that number?
[221:57.19]What's that number?
[221:59.29]What, like fucking 60 of you?
[222:14.15]Look at me!
[222:14.71]Look at me!
[222:15.17]No, why did I look at you?
[222:29.46]Now I'm all the way back here.
[222:32.46]I can't give up there, though.
[222:33.82]I can't.
[222:34.60]I refuse to give up here.
[222:37.04]You know what I mean?
[222:37.64]Like, this is it.
[222:38.41]Like, I can't do that.
[222:48.51]If I called my father with the portal app from Facebook, first of all, he'd answer it.
[222:57.84]And he'd be like, how are you on my TV?
[223:00.74]And I'd be like, it's kind of new technology, Dad.
[223:03.22]But I'm not going to complete Jump King.
[223:05.68]He'd be like, wait, wait a minute.
[223:14.83]You get your ass back there and you finish it.
[223:17.75]That's what us Albertsons do.
[223:21.29]The first Elbertson was a blacksmith.
[223:26.09]And all of his swords broke and they sucked.
[223:28.15]And they weren't worth using in battle.
[223:31.11]And he overcharged for all of them.
[223:33.35]But he still beat them.
[223:34.33]He still completed them.
[223:36.95]I'm like, yeah, you're right, Dan.
[223:38.09]No matter how bad I'm terrible at something, and how much worse I am than everybody else that's ever played this game, I could still complete it.
[223:46.56]That's right, son.
[223:48.29]Oh, thanks, Dad.
[223:48.89]Thanks for the advice.
[223:52.35]Yeah.
[223:53.03]It doesn't matter how much you suck at something.
[223:54.79]Just finish it.
[223:57.01]Oh, cool.
[223:57.35]Thanks, Dad.
[223:59.57]And then we both... I don't, um... Do you... How do you hang up?
[224:04.27]I don't... You've called me.
[224:05.74]I don't know.
[224:06.08]Is it... Is there a button?
[224:07.38]I don't use this stupid app from Facebook.
[224:08.96]What is this?
[224:10.88]I... I'm gonna turn my TV off.
[224:13.48]Yeah, try turning off your TV like you actually physically turn off the television.
[224:18.61]Can you hear me?
[224:19.83]Yeah, I can still hear you.
[224:20.57]Hold on.
[224:22.64]What if I... I'm gonna call you from my phone and see if it, like, cuts it off.
[224:24.92]Yeah, there's no button to press.
[224:28.60]I found it.
[224:28.96]It's here.
[224:46.63]No, I... Now I'm stuck at this stupid jump.
[224:52.25]This is the wall now.
[224:54.79]This is the wall here.
[224:55.69]I can do it.
[224:57.73]I can do it.
[224:58.71]Just fail a million times.
[225:06.93]How far has he gotten?
[225:08.55]I don't know.
[225:09.15]Up until the snow level.
[225:11.45]Whatever that means.
[225:19.34]No, no, no.
[225:19.80]Yeah, the windy.
[225:20.93]Windy level.
[225:21.73]Jeff, thanks for the five community subs, Jeff.
[225:23.31]Thank you.
[225:24.79]I got to windy level.
[225:31.33]That's 25% through.
[225:32.51]That's not bad.
[225:33.25]I think I can do it.
[225:36.18]I think I can do it.
[225:39.54]Alright, get me in here.
[225:40.40]Let's go.
[225:41.98]Let's get some actual fucking music.
[225:43.40]Some actual good motivational music.
[225:49.35]I'm going to go for it.
[225:54.15]Workout motivation music.
[225:59.88]Rip Vaught.
[226:34.42]Rising up, back on the street.
[226:38.08]Did my time, took my chances.
[226:39.96]We're the distance now, I'm back on my feet.
[226:44.54]Just a man and his will to survive.
[226:48.09]It's the eye of the tiger, it's the cream of the fight.
[226:51.71]Rising up to the challenge of our rival.
[226:55.53]At the last, no survivor starts to spring the night.
[226:58.23]And he's watching us all in the eye.
[227:08.00]I don't like this song.
[227:08.72]New song.
[227:15.57]This is the song I was doing.
[227:16.57]This is the song I was doing earlier.
[227:17.67]I was doing this.
[227:20.10]This is the one.
[233:33.06]rat all this for a loaf of bread start singing you won't get away so easy you think that was easy
[233:55.55]You two, over that way.
[233:56.99]And you, follow me.
[233:58.17]We'll find him.
[233:59.41]Morning, ladies.
[234:00.51]Getting into trouble a little early.
[234:02.07]This is the song.
[234:02.91]It's not even the right scene.
[234:04.47]Trouble?
[234:05.43]No way.
[234:06.43]You're only in trouble... And I want to, like, watch Aladdin.
[234:09.14]Guys!
[234:14.54]I don't want to watch Aladdin.
[234:17.06]Did I just get sued by Disney?
[234:18.72]Hold on.
[234:19.08]Come on, let's get out of here.
[234:21.81]One swing ahead of a sword.
[234:23.31]I steal only what I can't afford.
[234:26.40]That's everything.
[234:27.86]One jump ahead of the lawmen.
[234:33.34]I can't get by this.
[234:35.14]No matter what I fucking do.
[234:37.32]It's this one jump.
[234:39.07]It's this one jump that I can't do.
[234:42.03]This one jump that's so excruciating for some reason.
[234:45.43]That jump to the left and there's nothing I can do.
[234:49.19]It's just a random event if I hit it or not.
[234:51.47]I've never been able to do it the whole time I've been playing.
[234:53.43]Not once.
[234:58.36]It's just been a random fucking guess to hit that jump every time.
[235:03.31]All these others, I know the timing for them.
[235:09.83]This shit's just a guess.
[235:12.27]It's a guess.
[235:15.09]Just guess.
[235:31.58]Yes.
[235:32.30]Just take a guess.
[235:33.49]Like half of the fucking jumps in this whole game, mademoiselle.
[235:53.28]Take a guess!
[235:54.36]I don't want to get sued by Disney.
[235:57.40]Let me get by this and then we'll put another song on.
[236:23.00]Take a fucking guess.
[236:25.99]It's just a, it's just a guess every time.
[236:32.45]I can't even get by this shit.
[236:34.41]I'm like 15 screens up this stupid part of the game.
[236:50.25]You need to hold the button down exactly 2.3.1.4525255 seconds.
[237:09.43]Okay, for the love of God.
[237:11.03]I am never doing that again.
[237:16.31]If I come back down here, if I fall back down here...
[237:19.85]Then I'm just... I'm not doing that again.
[237:22.09]I'll have somebody else do it for me.
[237:24.34]I will screenplay, share this, and somebody else will just do it for me.
[237:47.58]okay for the love of god it that was so that was so painful painful that was so painful listen to me mademoiselle Charlie Charlie
[238:13.35]be our guest be our guest put our service to the test tie your napkin round your whatever why your neck cherry and we will do the rest
[238:44.38]Just bang on the door and scare him when that's the what why would don't stop making me laugh Think fast think fast
[239:40.36]He jumped the wrong way again.
[239:42.56]For the up thousandth time.
[239:52.11]What am I doing?
[239:52.69]Why did I just do that?
[239:54.77]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[240:03.35]I wanna meet the people that completed this game.
[240:05.86]Like, on completion.
[240:07.74]I wonder how fucking red their eyes were.
[240:11.80]And if their back hurt.
[240:27.33]They didn't make it out.
[240:29.69]It consumed them.
[240:32.69]Oh god.
[240:45.28]Zoom in on that one, because that's the worst jump in the whole game so far.
[240:49.11]Absolutely, without a doubt.
[240:50.93]That is the worst jump in the entire fucking game.
[240:54.67]Without a thousand doubts.
[241:06.19]Like without a single doubt in my mind.
[241:12.02]I don't even have to think about that for a second.
[241:14.32]Hey, what was like the dumbest jump in the whole game?
[241:17.22]Oh, probably the one where you have to basketball yourself down a hole and it has to be exact or you fall down the whole thing.
[241:24.18]He doesn't know about the broken down helicopter.
[241:51.02]Like, the margin for human error.
[241:53.90]Can we just not give a shit about any of that?
[241:55.76]Or do robots have to play these games?
[241:57.19]Fucking Jump King.
[242:36.58]Somebody else is doing it for me.
[242:37.58]No, they're not.
[242:38.42]Oh, my God.
[242:39.06]How did I keep adding up down here?
[242:40.74]Because they have these... They have, like, three jumps that are so fucking finicky that if you... Like... Why are these not like that?
[242:51.81]Why is this jump right here not... Why is this jump right here not like that?
[242:55.13]I don't understand.
[243:00.25]It's fucking ridiculous.
[243:10.88]And it sucks because I know it's intentional.
[243:15.23]Like, there's a person right now standing in front of me.
[243:18.77]And I'm not supposed to get mad at this person.
[243:21.71]right but this person is going in my face la la la la la la la la la hey hey la la la la la la and I'm he's doing uh okay what should I do he had to be like get the away from me like that's what that's what this game is doing it's just like hey hey hey like right in my face it's like dude get the out of here no it's intentional therefore
[243:51.05]See, I got you.
[244:25.01]Did he make it yet?
[244:26.02]No.
[244:26.58]Not even close.
[244:41.22]It's just so... Like, humans are so imperfect, you know what I mean?
[244:50.65]This game goes against everything we know.
[244:53.01]As humans.
[244:55.35]Fuel burns are imperfect.
[244:57.67]We can't do perfect fucking things.
[245:01.65]We're not capable of that.
[245:17.00]You can't.
[245:17.62]The speed burn is five minutes.
[245:20.38]And that person probably spent...
[245:24.02]hundreds and hundreds of hours playing this.
[245:27.52]Those are some red ass eyes.
[245:39.79]It was five minutes.
[245:48.50]Don't make me laugh.
[245:49.18]I'm trying to get out of here.
[246:19.88]By the way, this guy wouldn't last in the fucking MCU.
[246:22.26]I got news for you.
[246:24.65]He would do this, and then get liquidated.
[247:01.54]That was just so long ago.
[247:04.57]Can we agree that I'm not gonna get the coin?
[247:07.47]I don't care.
[247:07.87]No coin.
[247:20.67]This is a coinless run.
[247:31.20]What was wrong with that?
[247:32.98]What was wrong with that?
[247:40.25]Who just gave money?
[247:43.25]Lots of money.
[247:46.87]Uh, Piggums gave 10,000 bits.
[247:53.48]Thank you, Piggums, for the huge amount of money.
[247:56.12]And there was also community subs, too, from Flinzenberg.
[247:59.24]Five community subs.
[248:00.44]But Piggum says, I've been watching your content for years now, and the laughs you've given me have carried me through undergrad and dental school.
[248:08.09]We got a dentist.
[248:10.01]Here's your cut from one of my first paychecks.
[248:11.83]Don't stop being you.
[248:12.73]We got a real dentist in the chat.
[248:14.35]You understand?
[248:22.00]Well, that's awesome to hear.
[248:27.11]Do that dental work.
[248:28.11]Do the good dental work.
[248:31.04]And thank you so much for the 100 bucks for 10,000 bits.
[248:33.44]That's a lot of money.
[248:34.10]Thank you.
[248:36.58]And good luck with those patients.
[248:51.12]God damn it, everything has to be 100, 100% perfect every fucking single time.
[249:04.27]You can't.
[249:05.73]There's no margin.
[249:08.27]Zero.
[249:09.79]Zero.
[249:11.08]You do it perfect every time or delete the game.
[249:20.79]Turn your facecam on.
[249:21.81]No, you don't want to see me right now.
[249:24.52]I look like shit.
[250:08.14]Check for his red eyes.
[250:10.08]Hold on.
[250:10.58]Hold on.
[250:10.92]Let me just get back up here.
[250:13.60]Let me just get up here again.
[250:14.90]Like, this is dog shit.
[250:16.54]Hold on.
[250:16.88]Oh, my fucking God.
[250:31.16]Hehehe.
[250:31.94]Hehehe.
[250:32.32]Hehehe.
[250:33.36]Hehehe.
[250:34.95]You look.
[250:35.29]You fell 50,000 times.
[250:36.03]Hehehe.
[250:58.83]No, I can't get that one.
[251:00.01]It's just... Oh my fucking god.
[251:04.27]Are you kidding me, man?
[251:05.60]No fucking way.
[251:07.70]This is unbearable.
[251:11.08]Un-fucking-bearable.
[251:13.56]Un-unbearable.
[251:19.66]It's unbearable.
[251:22.64]I can't bear it any longer.
[251:24.68]But I'll continue to do so.
[251:43.78]He's too impatient.
[251:49.14]It's hard to stay patient when you've fallen down the same ledge 500 times.
[251:56.81]Just stay patient, man.
[251:58.45]Come on.
[251:59.27]Just relax.
[252:01.59]You've been hitting your head against a wall for three hours.
[252:04.45]Hey, just sit down.
[252:05.41]Just do it.
[252:06.05]You're cool.
[252:06.63]You got it.
[252:22.28]Jerma's going to be great one day.
[252:24.78]Oh, I know.
[252:31.25]One day.
[252:39.20]That's another thing.
[252:40.30]If you're really patient, you lose your flow and then you fuck it all up.
[253:10.35]Just don't suck.
[253:11.99]I'll explain that to the other 96% of every human that's downloaded this game.
[253:16.72]We should get them in a call.
[253:24.14]Let's call up the 96% of every living person that has downloaded Jump King.
[253:29.25]Let's ask them that.
[253:30.03]Let's tell them that.
[253:41.09]Let's do it.
[253:54.14]Am I using it?
[253:54.60]I'm using a controller.
[253:57.57]Most probably haven't even played the game.
[253:59.23]Well, they probably got it on a Steam sale.
[254:01.95]And, oh boy, they probably can't wait.
[254:03.29]Ooh, Jump King!
[254:05.21]That sounds, like, kind of fun.
[254:15.07]four hairs left Jump King I could I could I could have been I could have been like I could I could have been somebody
[254:54.76]Oh, my fucking God in heaven.
[254:57.63]God damn it.
[255:02.59]Remember, hey, remember, boys and girls, I'm like 14 screens up from here in progression, but I'm, look at me, stuck here.
[255:32.54]He's so mad.
[255:33.46]What should I not be?
[255:40.30]What should I do?
[255:40.78]God, no.
[255:44.21]Please, god damn it.
[255:47.77]It's that same stupid ass jump.
[255:51.63]They always put one.
[255:54.77]One jump.
[255:56.97]That's just... You gotta get it perfect or you're falling all the fucking way down.
[256:16.05]Did the people talking about Sekiro Easy Mode open this game?
[256:20.07]I feel like they'd have a heart attack.
[256:40.64]Do they know this one exists?
[256:45.92]I feel like they would turn, like, green if they played this.
[257:10.51]Okay, can we get this back on track?
[257:14.45]We can get this back on track.
[257:16.41]This game is designed to make you mad?
[257:17.91]Oh, yeah, I know.
[257:18.35]That's why I'm not done playing it.
[257:24.80]I know.
[257:25.18]Oh, I know.
[257:26.24]That doesn't mean I'm not slightly a little bit irritated.
[257:28.94]I only caught the last half of the incident, but Jaren seriously went off the road a lot.
[257:39.01]You're a masochist.
[257:40.63]No, we already went over this.
[257:41.45]If you like hot sauce, then it's the same thing.
[257:46.82]Alright, I can't fuck this up.
[257:48.26]I really can't.
[257:49.08]I cannot fuck this up.
[257:53.32]I have to get the hell out of here and go back to where I was progressing through the damn game.
[257:57.07]Blame the bird.
[257:58.19]Blame the fake true ending.
[258:05.32]No, and I should have known that was going to happen, what just happened right there.
[258:08.04]It's designed to fuck with you.
[258:10.96]It's built meticulously.
[258:13.70]This mad scientist game developer sat at every corner, every single little corner, and was like, had cauldrons bubbling behind him.
[258:26.51]It was meticulously crafted to fuck with you.
[258:41.87]Gruntilda?
[258:44.40]Yeah, this game dev is the Gruntilda of game development.
[258:52.78]I've devised such a fun game!
[259:31.04]No, no!
[259:34.20]Stupid basketball jump.
[259:35.74]Let's just take another guess.
[259:55.05]Try to remember the exact, well it's not the position, it's just the time holding the button.
[259:59.53]Because no matter what, you'll... You're never going to do it the same length every time.
[260:04.95]You'll always miss it by like a quarter of a second, like a tenth of a second.
[260:08.42]It's just like, alright, nope, that was a little bit too high, but I still made it.
[260:10.96]This one, no.
[260:11.34]I'm going to stand right at the edge and go one and two.
[260:14.50]No, it's way too high.
[260:15.68]Way too long.
[260:16.20]Way too long.
[260:16.84]No, just guess.
[260:41.18]Down we go?
[260:41.88]No, no, no.
[260:42.74]We're not down we go.
[260:44.52]We're good.
[260:53.14]Fuck off with this.
[260:54.28]I'm done with this.
[260:55.18]Let's get out and get me to progression where I was before.
[260:57.83]I'm done with this part.
[260:59.55]I was done with this part two and a half hours ago.
[261:03.07]What are we doing here again?
[261:05.67]What happened to that jump?
[261:06.97]What happened there?
[261:07.71]Why did it go?
[261:08.39]Why did that happen?
[261:10.44]Why did that happen?
[261:13.38]Why did that happen?
[261:15.03]And why did that happen again?
[261:16.95]Why did that happen?
[261:19.33]What the fuck?
[261:20.95]I didn't even press anything.
[261:23.15]Why?
[261:23.71]My god.
[261:25.40]You gotta be shitting me.
[261:28.06]You've got to be shitting me.
[261:33.12]What, did I press the A or something?
[261:35.10]How?
[261:35.76]What?
[261:42.22]I, like, pressed it too early and hit the... Here we go again.
[261:49.42]No, not even close.
[261:55.86]I can't believe it.
[261:57.02]I can't believe it.
[261:59.76]I can't fucking believe it.
[262:03.08]I can't believe it.
[262:04.46]Oh...
[262:24.43]Like, you gotta let me in, man.
[262:26.61]Why?
[262:27.27]Like, why does it have to do that?
[262:31.79]I don't understand.
[262:32.93]What the fuck?
[262:42.21]You've got to be kidding.
[262:44.34]It's ridiculous.
[262:47.22]And now we're down here again.
[262:48.48]Oh my fucking god.
[262:56.73]There's no reason for that.
[262:59.01]It's 100 out of 100 in difficulty.
[263:04.70]100.
[263:04.72]Dude, Sekiro was like, for me, Sekiro was like an 88.
[263:09.74]This is a 100.
[263:18.06]This game's not hard.
[263:18.80]Yes, it is.
[263:26.62]This is a religious experience.
[263:27.94]Yeah, I feel like I'm going to start to see hallucinations here in a minute.
[263:44.39]Come on.
[263:45.91]Go eat something?
[263:46.67]I've already eaten.
[263:47.44]I had to stake them.
[263:56.39]Steakums.
[263:57.59]Steakums are pretty fucking good.
[264:10.40]Generally, are you okay?
[264:11.46]Don't make yourself unhealthy.
[264:14.98]I'm good.
[264:19.45]Guys, we're at like... Did you see The Simpsons hit and run stream?
[264:27.06]This is like a six out of Simpson's Hit and Run.
[264:35.07]I mean, that... Really?
[264:39.87]We're approaching it.
[264:44.98]Maybe.
[264:53.04]Guys, guys, it's been four and a half hours.
[264:58.20]Why does everybody act like I haven't drank water in three days?
[265:02.13]What?
[265:38.29]Oh, hey, don't mind me.
[265:39.23]Just Jerma985.
[265:39.99]Fifteen screens up is progression, but I'm still down at the tutorial.
[265:45.18]Hi.
[265:46.26]Hi, good to meet you.
[265:47.08]Good to see you.
[265:52.92]Because this tutorial zone has three jumps in it that suck balls.
[266:00.35]That sucks asshole.
[266:11.01]Uh-oh, he's getting crude.
[266:35.05]I'm laughing too hard right now.
[266:37.76]What, at me?
[266:38.36]Or did somebody tell you a joke?
[266:44.19]Dude, seriously.
[266:45.63]I've done this so many times.
[266:47.83]Why do I...
[266:58.66]oh god damn it that person that person screwed it all up I was oh god damn it you gotta be kidding me man you come on like really really where's the system in place so I don't have to fucking do this oh
[267:24.51]Use a keyboard.
[267:25.89]No way.
[267:26.54]Not four and a half hours into this.
[267:28.46]Not a chance, guys.
[267:31.60]All my memory.
[267:32.46]All my muscle memory.
[267:34.64]I can't go over that.
[267:35.60]I can't do that now.
[267:36.54]I just gotta get back up to where I was before.
[267:47.98]It's all this dumb bird coin.
[267:51.86]That's...
[267:59.26]I got a prediction.
[268:00.04]In like the alternate metaverse, I don't collect that stupid coin on the right.
[268:04.77]I'm probably still there, progressing.
[268:12.29]Fuck that coin.
[268:14.85]You ain't ever gonna see me get that coin again.
[268:20.58]Unless I get it on accident.
[269:26.46]It's the worst jump of the whole game.
[269:30.26]It's the worst.
[269:30.68]Just look at how fast I'm just going through all this shit.
[269:33.31]And then I hit that dumbass jump.
[269:38.59]And it all falls to shit.
[269:45.65]No.
[269:50.37]He's still here, Omega Lull.
[269:52.99]Yeah.
[269:56.38]Alright, quiet.
[269:58.58]I keep overshooting it.
[269:59.46]Yeah, when I try to undershoot it, when I try to not overshoot it, I undershoot it.
[270:03.54]And sometimes, I even go in the fucking thing, and then it spits me out.
[271:03.48]Do the DLC.
[271:04.36]Why would I do the DLC when I haven't done the original game?
[271:25.23]Some of these shouldn't be landing.
[271:26.73]Like, come on.
[271:28.47]What the fuck?
[271:35.76]And then immediately after is that stupid ass fucking jump.
[271:40.31]Oh my god, guys.
[271:43.05]Like, right after it is that other, like, tiny little perfect baby jump.
[271:49.77]Give me a break.
[271:58.82]I can't get out of this zone!
[272:02.92]I'm stuck here.
[272:03.76]Forever!
[272:09.64]Stuck here forever.
[272:12.06]I think I might be stuck here forever.
[272:36.91]I believe in you.
[272:38.11]I don't.
[272:55.07]fuck you game fuck you game fuck you game really let's be honest whoa whoa dude what the fuck I'm sorry that was uncalled for
[273:32.14]I screw this up every time.
[273:33.66]And I got- it's gotta be far away.
[273:37.25]Right?
[273:37.83]Oh.
[273:39.17]No.
[273:39.69]No.
[273:40.09]God damn it.
[273:45.25]Stop til- it has nothing to do with tilting.
[273:47.55]It has to do with that jump is so fucking precise.
[273:52.52]It's the only one in this whole zone that's like that.
[273:58.24]And even if you think you got it, you don't.
[273:59.90]Oh, you don't.
[274:00.62]Don't worry.
[274:01.34]You don't.
[274:11.83]My sanity meter is low?
[274:14.41]Don't read chat.
[274:15.29]Eh, nothing to do with chat.
[274:20.28]It has to do with I'm a mean game designer.
[274:23.34]And want players to suffer.
[274:26.78]That's what it is.
[274:34.71]That's the goal.
[275:35.09]Fucking analog.
[275:36.72]Sucks!
[275:46.78]I don't think I can hit it from here.
[275:49.97]I'm gonna just launch over.
[275:58.29]Yep.
[275:59.00]You just can't from there.
[276:01.12]Maybe you can.
[276:05.19]Can't hit it from the back.
[276:06.15]No, no, no, no.
[276:42.89]I just want to get back to where I was.
[277:01.69]Why did that happen?
[277:07.63]It's not about destination, it's about the journey.
[277:14.63]Now it's about the destination.
[277:17.56]At this point.
[277:18.66]It's about the destination.
[277:21.14]I want to get there.
[277:22.88]It's about getting there.
[277:23.70]It's about getting to the top.
[277:24.98]That's what it is.
[277:26.00]Oh, really?
[277:30.46]So we're driving across a country trip to go to Disney World?
[277:37.13]And I got four kids screaming in the back, singing songs while everyone's yelling.
[277:42.91]My wife's in the passenger seat with a map in her hands going like, I don't think you went the wrong, I think you went the wrong way.
[277:48.16]I didn't go the wrong way.
[277:54.96]No, you want to get to Disney World.
[278:00.40]Fuck the car ride to Disney World.
[278:02.60]You want to get to Disney World and go see Goofy.
[278:45.56]Get the coin.
[278:47.16]Don't get the coin.
[278:48.22]Don't get the coin.
[278:49.00]Don't get the coin.
[278:50.40]Don't get the coin.
[278:51.10]It's death.
[278:51.76]It's guaranteed to lose.
[278:53.30]You're guaranteed to lose if you get that coin in this wind now.
[278:56.23]Mean game developer.
[278:57.19]I told you.
[279:01.11]I got the coin.
[279:01.71]I got the coin.
[279:02.23]I got the coin.
[279:02.67]I got the coin.
[279:03.33]I got the coin.
[279:03.87]Okay.
[279:04.17]Coin.
[279:04.45]Got it.
[279:15.24]I got the coin.
[279:15.72]I got the coin.
[279:22.08]What happened there?
[279:22.86]What the fuck was that, man?
[279:25.29]What the fuck was that, man?
[279:27.35]What?
[279:28.35]I've done it the same way every single time, man.
[279:31.43]What do you... What?
[279:32.44]I've done it the same way every single time, man.
[279:55.44]That was a fun ride.
[280:00.30]I ain't driving Disney World fucking ever again.
[280:02.72]We're Ubering next time.
[280:15.67]I've done it the same fucking time.
[280:17.81]And like the two times out of like 60.
[280:20.21]It doesn't work apparently.
[280:24.68]The same exact approach!
[280:29.73]No, don't even do this!
[280:40.82]I'm doing it in the wrong direction?
[280:42.10]No, I'm not.
[280:53.38]No, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[280:55.98]They make these little jumps such a pain in the ass.
[280:58.93]Like, what a pain in the ass.
[281:01.73]What a pain in the ass.
[281:05.73]It's because of the fucking coin again.
[281:09.18]I'm gonna break this disk in half.
[281:11.62]And I don't even own one.
[281:13.38]I'm gonna go buy the disk version of this game and then break it.
[281:20.28]Back to the tutorial.
[281:21.57]Hi guys.
[281:22.51]Welcome.
[281:25.50]All because I picked up the fucking coin.
[281:28.70]Oh, alright.
[281:29.40]Now I have to... And we gotta do all these pains in the ass jumps again.
[281:41.28]When I bet you anything that all we would need to do is just simply go up like one screen at the wind level and we ain't ever gonna see this shit ever again.
[281:55.25]I would guarantee it.
[282:01.10]Boots, boots.
[282:02.04]What are you talking about boots?
[282:02.96]I can't buy the boots.
[282:03.70]What do you mean to use the coin?
[282:04.56]I don't have a coin.
[282:05.30]I don't have any coins.
[282:07.63]What are you talking about?
[282:26.71]Really?
[282:27.05]In the state I'm in right now?
[282:30.83]You're gonna do this to me in my current state?
[282:40.61]I can't fucking believe I'm down here again.
[282:42.35]And I was already... We saw it twice.
[282:44.96]I got a second chance to get back up there.
[282:49.58]At least there was progress.
[282:51.08]There was.
[282:51.88]At least a little bit.
[282:52.44]I did get... I picked up the coin.
[282:54.26]I did make the bird move.
[283:04.06]Can you imagine if I missed?
[283:10.61]Dude.
[283:29.58]jump sucks such ass it sucks to do that jump it sucks it's gotta be this little perfect fucking jump man and if you don't get it you are fucked
[284:04.05]I'm trying- no.
[284:10.00]Challenge Joel to beat this?
[284:11.74]No, no, I'd like to see Joel live a nice, healthy life.
[284:14.76]And not delete, like, three years of his life.
[284:17.40]Because he had to play the hot sauce game.
[284:19.14]No, no, no, no, no.
[284:20.22]Joel, don't play this.
[284:21.40]Don't.
[284:21.80]Don't do it.
[284:22.42]Do not do this.
[284:40.56]Don't.
[284:40.90]Don't do it.
[284:42.70]And then when you get to this part where you're going, What's with this fucking jump?
[284:47.72]Replay this clip.
[284:48.90]And just listen to my voice.
[284:51.66]I tried to tell you not to do it.
[284:53.79]I tried.
[284:54.93]Don't do it.
[284:55.89]Don't do it.
[284:56.55]Just play Nancy Drew.
[284:59.51]That's more our speed, you know?
[285:01.03]That's more our speed.
[285:31.02]It's just, like, a quarter of an inch too small, a quarter of an inch too long.
[285:34.76]It's like, come on.
[285:36.18]There's no, like, it's just, like, so, it doesn't make any sense to me.
[285:40.08]Like, what the fuck, man?
[285:43.93]Give me a break.
[285:48.25]Give me a fucking break.
[285:49.95]That's just unfair.
[285:51.79]That's just unfair.
[285:53.19]It is.
[285:54.27]That's unfair.
[285:57.27]Why are those the only two places where I have trouble?
[285:59.99]Why?
[286:01.39]Why?
[286:01.61]I could do everything else.
[286:07.40]Why those two places?
[286:08.96]Tweedledee and Tweedledum of annoying jumps.
[286:11.06]Back to back, right there.
[286:30.37]What the fuck, Mike?
[286:32.57]No, no, no, no, no.
[286:34.43]You don't understand.
[286:35.19]You don't understand.
[286:35.86]You don't understand.
[286:36.44]You don't know.
[286:37.40]You don't know.
[286:38.60]You don't know what happened.
[286:39.42]You don't know.
[286:40.10]Listen for the ding.
[286:40.78]Listen.
[286:42.86]Listen for it.
[286:51.71]I ripped the controller... I ripped the plug out of the controller.
[286:55.51]The controller... I ripped the plug out of the controller.
[286:59.96]I, uh... And then I pressed the... And then I pressed right.
[287:10.40]I can't believe I'm fucking down here again.
[287:11.92]I already beat this.
[287:15.12]Don't you understand just how stupid this is?
[287:20.46]Two coin attempts.
[287:22.08]And I was there already.
[287:23.82]Why did I have to do that again?
[287:29.98]What was the purpose of this?
[287:32.38]Can somebody- I don't- Just spoil the whole game.
[287:34.44]I don't care.
[287:36.12]What happens if you don't get the coin?
[287:37.48]What happens if you- What happens if you get the coin?
[287:38.92]Just- I don't give a shit.
[287:39.95]Spoil it.
[287:45.25]You get the boots.
[287:46.43]Who cares?
[288:07.63]Is all this pain worth the game?
[288:10.91]Uh, it depends on how you view pain.
[288:14.69]Um, it's up to you.
[288:18.64]If you, uh, if you like the feeling of all of your teeth falling out, this game's for you then.
[288:25.29]If you like the sound of nails on a chalkboard while somebody is punching you in the chest as hard as they can, I mean, this could be a game for you.
[288:49.09]If you like eating ice cream, like just yummy chocolate ice cream,
[288:55.41]I've got a game series you might like.
[288:58.33]Nancy Drew.
[289:09.28]I can't believe I'm back here again.
[289:11.60]Like, you could rewind this stream to when I made it back up to the wind place.
[289:17.66]Like, you gotta be kidding me.
[289:19.40]What am I doing down here again for a third?
[289:21.98]What's going on?
[289:25.49]You gotta be kidding me.
[289:27.61]Like, seriously?
[289:28.51]I can't even believe it.
[289:30.03]Like, I'm like, oh, and we're gonna hit the bottom of the game.
[289:34.95]Why did I get the coin?
[289:37.45]What was the purpose of me getting?
[289:39.83]This is the beginning.
[289:40.73]Welcome to the beginning of the game.
[289:42.60]Hi.
[289:43.96]Stay.
[289:44.78]Screen one.
[289:47.68]Yes.
[289:48.30]Yay.
[289:48.74]We did it, boys and girls.
[289:50.22]We made it to the end.
[289:51.28]We made it to the game.
[289:52.20]The end of the game.
[289:52.86]There it is.
[289:54.73]I did it!
[289:55.11]I saw it!
[290:05.36]Like, can I go back in time?
[290:07.61]And like... Belly to back suplex Jerma from fucking an hour ago?
[290:12.31]I think I'm gonna go get that coin!
[290:16.41]Can I like fucking scoop slam him?
[290:18.36]And take over his place?
[290:29.23]Like, I don't care if I'm the new Jerma.
[290:31.77]Jerma, if you're listening to me in the future, just come do it and be the Jerma.
[290:34.50]That's fine.
[290:50.37]That would create a time paradox.
[290:52.49]Worth it.
[290:52.75]That'd be worth it.
[291:10.46]Okay, here we go.
[291:11.18]Just get me... I will get back to the snow.
[291:13.96]You guys know it.
[291:14.58]It's gonna happen.
[291:17.24]Hey, I just got back from a four-hour gaming session.
[291:18.84]How's the progress going?
[291:23.68]Um... Not bad, actually.
[291:26.34]Pretty good.
[291:26.88]I think I'm doing okay.
[291:29.46]I wouldn't say I'm doing terribly.
[291:33.53]You know what I mean?
[291:36.05]He's on New Game Plus.
[291:37.15]Yeah, I mean, this is the New Game Plus version.
[291:51.78]Oh, I just... There's no more coin to get.
[291:54.92]And we can be over this pain.
[291:58.40]It'll be so great.
[291:59.76]The second we... I can't wait till we all start pogging our brains out.
[292:03.29]Dude, I'm gonna pog so hard I might pass out when I actually get to the snow level and go up once.
[292:11.37]I'm gonna pog my pants.
[292:23.93]I messed it up.
[292:26.00]Thank god the game had mercy.
[292:53.41]Don't fuck it up.
[292:54.17]You got it.
[292:54.65]You got this.
[292:55.17]I know you do.
[292:56.08]Everything's cool.
[293:04.88]It's not.
[293:11.07]I wish there was a Mega Man indicator.
[293:12.79]Like, the longer you held down, it was like... Rather than just... You know what I mean?
[293:19.87]I wish it was like a... Give me like an audio cue.
[293:40.86]What the fuck happened there, man?
[293:42.08]What the fuck?
[293:42.60]I'm getting sad.
[293:43.26]Not even angry, I'm getting sad.
[293:45.58]He's getting sad.
[293:46.12]He's gonna cry or dream.
[294:16.35]It's okay.
[294:16.87]It's alright.
[294:17.21]No, no, don't worry.
[294:17.85]Somebody just wrote.
[294:19.09]Somebody just wrote.
[294:19.79]Dude, you can play something else.
[294:21.65]It's okay.
[294:22.23]I feel bad for you.
[294:24.80]Don't worry.
[294:25.20]I'll be fucking around.
[294:25.92]Don't worry.
[294:27.48]Don't worry.
[294:27.88]Don't worry.
[294:30.54]Alright, that's like making me laugh.
[294:34.11]Dude, just play something else, man.
[294:35.59]Like, I feel really bad for you.
[294:39.95]You guys, it's all good.
[294:45.35]I feel bad for you.
[294:47.35]Oh.
[294:53.13]Don't feel bad.
[294:57.83]Just quit streaming.
[294:58.73]It's not for you.
[294:59.80]Yeah.
[295:00.44]I'm kidding.
[295:09.50]I'm just fucking kidding.
[295:11.02]Oh.
[295:17.08]I just want to get up to the snow part, and then that's, that's like my, I suck at the game.
[295:21.86]Like, I suck asshole at the game.
[295:23.72]Like, if I get to snow level three times, then I win.
[295:27.71]You know when, like, you have, like, a child play game, and they get to a portion, and you just want to play, so you just go, oh, you beat it, you won, you did it!
[295:34.31]I did?
[295:34.75]Yeah, I won.
[295:35.21]Yeah, you won!
[295:35.97]Nice work!
[295:38.67]Oh!
[295:39.43]Yeah, good job!
[295:40.63]And then you take it back, you're just like, I gotta get this away from this kid.
[295:52.41]It's like hands are like bright red.
[296:33.68]Hello?
[296:34.08]What's up?
[296:48.56]What, the internet died?
[296:49.56]Oh.
[296:50.12]Yeah, that makes sense.
[296:52.64]It is cocked internet, you know.
[296:53.78]Well, don't worry.
[296:55.56]That's just like another VOD.
[296:58.39]Actually, no, it shouldn't be.
[297:05.21]Okay.
[297:06.89]Same deal.
[297:08.29]Get me up there.
[297:09.79]Let's go, baby.
[297:11.60]This is the one.
[297:34.28]Chat's gonna be delayed on the VOD?
[297:35.75]Yeah, I know, that sucks.
[297:39.01]I almost wish, with that feature... I wish that that feature didn't have... Maybe if it paused the chat for a few minutes or something?
[297:50.73]Because it throws up the whole thing, doesn't it?
[297:54.15]Rip VOD watchers, yeah.
[297:55.41]Sorry, guys.
[297:59.14]Sorry!
[298:10.52]fall down if it's live what you think I'm pumping in like pre-recorded footage it's too far and it's too short then it's too far then it's too short then it's too far then it's too short then it's too far then it's too short then it's too far then it's too short then it's too far then it's too short
[298:40.06]Then it's too far, then it's too short, then it's too far, then it's too short, then it's too far.
[298:43.00]Then it's too far, then it's too short, then it's too far, then it's too short.
[298:47.24]It doesn't matter what you do.
[298:48.34]You'll fuck it up every time.
[298:52.13]Did you hold the button down for like a tenth of a second earlier?
[298:55.09]You missed.
[298:55.65]Did you hold it for a tenth of a second longer?
[298:57.27]You jumped into the wall, idiot.
[299:10.31]I want a supercut of every fall.
[299:11.71]Now that actually would be kind of interesting considering there's been 581 of them.
[299:35.81]Just skip through the VOD.
[299:37.25]This is the supercut.
[299:54.22]I really... I think this part is way harder than the next part.
[299:59.54]The part with the platforms.
[300:00.56]Like, I wish I could just fall down to that spot and not have to do this jump.
[300:04.21]Like that.
[300:04.91]Like, why?
[300:06.59]Why?
[300:06.97]Why?
[300:07.35]Why?
[300:07.83]Why?
[300:08.37]Like, why?
[300:14.01]I would rather do the top, the screen above that, a thousand more times.
[300:31.30]Jump.
[300:31.90]Jump.
[300:32.54]Jump.
[300:33.96]Jump.
[300:38.81]Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[300:48.24]Let's go.
[300:50.68]End of the stream?
[300:51.74]What?
[300:52.02]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[300:53.28]Not even close.
[300:57.53]If he didn't make that jump, he would have turned off the stream.
[301:00.11]No.
[301:00.17]No.
[301:55.97]Don't laugh at what that person just said.
[301:59.33]I almost just fucking started laughing.
[302:01.37]Somebody said, somebody said, please show facecam.
[302:05.14]I want to see a crying face.
[302:10.66]I have to laugh now.
[302:14.38]Just tears coming down my eyes.
[302:15.96]Okay.
[302:30.74]Haven't been here in a while.
[302:31.64]I haven't been here in a while.
[302:32.94]Oh, I haven't been here in a while.
[302:50.45]What?
[302:53.44]Stop playing badly.
[302:54.60]What are you talking about?
[302:57.38]I just haven't, it's been, it's been like 40 minutes since I've been up at that screen.
[303:08.40]No, it's okay, it's alright, it's alright.
[303:17.94]Don't overshoot it.
[303:25.11]Oh, no, it's okay, it's alright.
[303:32.13]No, god damn it.
[303:32.99]That's the worst thing that could happen.
[303:58.57]God damn it.
[304:22.38]What was wrong with that?
[304:23.52]What was wrong with that one?
[304:26.34]Get out of here.
[304:27.32]Fuck off.
[304:32.33]I just pogged.
[304:33.99]No, hold your pogs.
[304:34.97]Hold your pogs.
[304:35.59]Hold your pogs.
[304:36.35]Hold your pogs.
[304:39.37]No pogging.
[304:40.23]Hold them.
[305:56.11]I was doing the jump I was doing the jump and fucked it up I was doing the jump Keep it going
[306:15.62]I was doing the get pumped up thing and I slipped and pressed the button and I jumped off the fucking edge.
[306:23.42]Oh, God.
[306:24.08]Oh, my heart is racing right now.
[306:26.76]I thought I was going all the way down.
[306:29.10]It worked for a minute.
[306:31.83]It's like, I seriously thought I was going all the way down.
[306:34.91]I was like, no, please.
[306:36.63]Not again.
[306:37.03]Okay, relax.
[306:41.53]I'm not playing any more music.
[306:42.63]I'm just going to fucking do it.
[306:53.90]premature pogulation.
[307:03.75]What's wrong with that?
[307:06.82]Oh, goddammit, man.
[307:28.52]Get up there again.
[307:32.22]And I just, like, sweat.
[307:35.80]You know what I mean?
[307:37.32]Like, I just... I get... I'm covered in water.
[307:42.04]Like, my hands are just covered in water.
[307:45.58]Like, where's my compensation for... Like, where's my water compensation?
[307:49.32]I'm like a water player.
[308:07.66]That one sucks, too.
[308:10.67]This one... This one also sucks.
[308:16.61]Please beat this game, that's all I'm asking.
[308:19.09]We'll see.
[308:19.91]We'll see in another... We'll see when I get up here.
[308:29.05]Now, the answer is probably going to be no.
[308:47.03]off with this alright this is it I didn't even know you could hit your head on that slow down slow down slow down slow down slow down
[309:15.10]I don't know why I didn't realize you could get your head on that.
[309:17.84]And we're OK.
[309:39.95]Uh-huh.
[309:49.52]Man, it's so precise.
[309:51.79]It's so... It's so... It's so much.
[309:57.75]It's so much.
[310:02.93]What happened there?
[310:08.71]He thinks falling is funny.
[310:13.88]God damn it, man.
[310:18.85]It's just so hard to tell a lot of times what is and isn't going to land on certain things.
[310:29.08]He thinks this is a joke?
[310:33.16]Is it?
[310:33.40]I don't know.
[310:34.14]What do you think?
[310:59.37]No, come on.
[311:01.23]That jump right there, oh, it sucks because you have to get them right on that left edge to be able to make the platform on the left.
[311:22.00]no god damn it I've had it you can't go that far with it you can't go that far with it oh god damn it oh slow down slow down stop stop stop oh it's oh my god it's so hard it's the hardest thing I've ever done in my whole life
[311:47.48]And I've done open heart surgery on somebody.
[311:50.50]Guys, I'm a fucking surgeon.
[311:52.08]I didn't tell you that.
[311:52.82]That's a lawyer that you never had.
[311:55.96]Why do I think I'm late all the time?
[312:09.20]Doctor Strange.
[312:23.81]I held it down for long.
[312:25.29]I swear to God, I held that for the exact same amount of time I did last time.
[312:30.23]But there's no way for me to tell because there's no goddamn feedback as to how long you're doing anything.
[313:48.42]Pog and ball torture!
[313:52.77]ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[314:28.28]It's just... That is the hardest jump here.
[314:52.74]Fuck my foot my fuck my hands.
[314:55.52]Listen to this.
[314:56.48]That's oil.
[314:57.46]That is oil all over me That's fucking oil covered in my I'm covered in it It's like disgusting and I missed that because I my hand slid around I'm actually covered in oil
[315:23.50]I wish I could just play this with my eyes.
[315:28.75]When's that technology gonna come out that I don't use my greasy-ass hands anymore?
[315:39.91]Like, I need to... You know what I'm gonna install in my house?
[315:43.05]One of those in-the-bathroom hand dryers.
[315:46.74]Like the...
[315:52.90]I need it.
[315:53.54]I actually need that.
[315:56.01]I really do.
[316:01.35]Those things get germs everywhere.
[316:02.69]I don't care about germs as much as not having wet hands.
[316:22.80]Yeah, I have to go dry my hands.
[316:26.16]I need powder.
[316:28.53]I'm gonna cover my fucking hands in talcum powder.
[316:31.15]You think this is bullshit?
[316:32.43]I'm doing it right now.
[316:34.63]That's been a major problem this whole stream.
[316:59.52]You blame your biology for your skills?
[317:03.36]Yeah, guys, sorry.
[317:05.02]If I'm reading a book and the book is wet, the pages are gonna be fucked up.
[317:12.91]I'm gonna dry up these fucking hands.
[317:14.69]I'm gonna cover with a comical, a hysterical, like Jerry Lewis movie amount of powder all over my hands.
[317:23.80]I'll be right back.
[319:20.34]Alright.
[319:21.52]Better.
[319:22.88]Let's go.
[319:27.30]Better.
[319:28.14]Let's do it.
[319:33.79]Do a hand cam?
[319:34.69]No, no, no.
[319:36.39]You're not getting a goddamn hand cam.
[319:39.83]No hand cams.
[319:43.01]You've tried to do that, so I'll blow it all and we'll go back to the tutorial zone again.
[319:49.54]Feels a little better.
[319:50.10]My grip is a little bit better.
[320:11.39]If I didn't... That one always gets me because it's such a fucking weird angle.
[320:17.99]The angle there sucks.
[320:42.53]So now I'll tell you something that's disgusting that's going on.
[320:46.09]This made it worse.
[320:48.39]Because now the powder is turning into this disgusting clay substance on my hands.
[320:59.14]It's now a, uh, like molding clay.
[321:07.74]I'm gonna- do I need to go get winter gloves?
[321:10.54]No, because they'll be slipping around.
[321:17.71]Molding clay.
[321:19.77]Molding clay.
[321:21.09]That's correct.
[321:26.46]Can I retract my pog?
[321:28.58]Yes.
[321:29.26]Yes, you can.
[321:34.26]You only pog if we get up here.
[321:58.27]If they fuck with the background, fucks with you.
[322:00.66]It's intentional.
[322:20.78]No, that's... Oh my god.
[322:25.48]God damn perfect ass jumps.
[322:29.35]I guess it's not called walk king, right?
[322:31.49]It's called perfect ass no room for any pixel of error Jump King.
[322:37.72]Just call it pixel perfect king.
[322:40.56]It's the same damn thing.
[322:56.26]Greasy man covers hands in clay out of frustration with children's game.
[323:00.24]No children is gonna play this game.
[323:02.99]No child is gonna get past the first.
[323:04.75]They're gonna be stuck at the bottom.
[323:54.76]Kids beat this game.
[323:55.74]It's like so much worse.
[323:59.56]I have to like wash the controller.
[324:05.77]God damn it, you motherfucker.
[324:12.31]Oh, you motherfucker.
[324:16.15]Oh, it's so... It's too much.
[324:17.92]It's too much.
[324:21.50]It's too much.
[324:24.01]I'll be lucky to get through this.
[324:27.87]I'll be lucky to get to even 10% of the way through this fucking game.
[324:39.88]4% of chat beat this game.
[324:41.04]I know.
[324:41.28]I'm trying to be one of them.
[324:42.86]I'm trying to be one of them.
[324:44.98]I told you I want to be somebody.
[324:46.52]Here we go.
[324:46.96]It's my opportunity.
[325:10.54]Just bounce so I do it again.
[325:13.48]Make a good luck charm out of my clay.
[325:22.35]I can't hold this pog any longer.
[325:24.01]Well, you're going to have to, because I don't know when that's going to be available to you.
[325:30.07]I don't know.
[325:30.67]I have no idea.
[325:32.65]Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm jumping on four pixel-wide popsicle sticks.
[325:37.34]Give me one moment, please.
[326:03.40]Don't pog.
[326:04.20]Don't pog.
[326:04.68]Don't pog.
[326:05.14]Just hold on.
[326:21.97]God fucking damn it, man.
[326:25.09]Knife.
[326:28.23]Oh, yeah.
[326:30.96]Don't pog yet, hold on.
[326:32.21]You're gonna jinx me.
[327:23.75]Damn it, man.
[327:25.81]Are you fucking kidding me?
[327:27.73]Why do they have to make it like that?
[327:29.92]Why does it have to be like that?
[327:33.06]Like... So... Jumping on fucking popsicle sticks and if you fall, it's over.
[327:40.44]What the fuck were they thinking?
[327:53.25]thinking don't release the pogs don't do it there's no reason for it
[328:16.09]Those pogs are illegal.
[328:18.36]Jerma continued to lie about Jet Set Radio.
[328:20.64]I played Jet Set Radio and I got really angry at it and had to rage quit it.
[328:23.65]Do you remember that?
[328:45.34]It's either like you go way too far or you go not far enough.
[328:49.93]It's like that exact jump you have to do.
[328:53.55]You gotta get it right or it's never gonna happen.
[329:03.12]And now you get like so... There's just zero feedback.
[329:08.34]Makes me want to puke.
[329:25.08]Please stop blue pogging me.
[329:27.04]I'm sorry.
[329:29.14]I'm sorry.
[329:29.98]I have to get to the top of the mountain first before you're allowed to pog.
[329:33.63]Might as well, like you...
[330:15.75]Everyone wants to do it so bad, I know.
[330:18.68]I'd like you to as well.
[330:21.48]Trust me, I would.
[330:22.28]No, too far, too far.
[330:30.10]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, too far.
[330:31.68]Too, too short, too far, too short, too short, too short, too short, too far.
[330:38.04]Oh, wait, look at me.
[330:38.68]Oh, what's that?
[330:39.66]The room for error here is 0.1 seconds.
[330:42.12]Oh, that's too far.
[331:00.67]I ain't ever getting back up to that fucking dumb raven coin area.
[331:05.31]I ain't ever gonna get up there again.
[331:08.72]Am I?
[331:09.78]Am I just never gonna get up there again?
[331:11.20]Remember bandages in Meat Boy and how fun that mechanic was?
[331:24.00]I loved it.
[331:25.38]I thought it was awesome.
[331:30.18]This ain't it.
[331:40.25]Not even close.
[331:43.03]Oh my fucking god.
[331:46.35]Oh my fucking god.
[331:47.45]Oh my god.
[331:47.95]Oh my god.
[331:48.23]I'm turning the stream off.
[331:53.98]I don't care if I'm one of, like, 640 people on Earth that have beat this game.
[331:58.32]Who cares?
[331:59.44]Who fucking cares?
[332:11.27]Where's the redemption arc?
[332:12.37]I know, that's why I'm doing that.
[332:13.53]That's why I'm saying that, so I can fucking have a redemption arc.
[332:22.44]Well, the redemption arc has to happen, literally.
[332:25.00]Hey, welcome to the beginning of the game.
[332:26.71]Isn't this fun?
[332:28.25]Aren't you having a fun time?
[332:29.37]I have to go all the way to the beginning to go all the way to the end again.
[332:40.13]Yeah, you know, like, don't you know, like, you just, you have to go all the way to the back of the beginning of the game before you can do a full, true redemption arc?
[332:47.42]Here's the problem, guys.
[332:48.26]I'm sorry to make this, you know, about me here.
[332:51.92]We've had, like, six redemption arcs.
[332:54.68]I don't think my character's gonna live.
[332:57.28]I don't think I'm making it to season two, because we've had about six redemption arcs, and none of them worked out.
[333:09.22]I have to do this all again.
[333:10.23]God damn it man, like why?
[333:20.05]Why can't there be even anything?
[333:22.69]Why does it have to be like this?
[333:28.98]Why?
[333:30.44]Not like this.
[333:34.21]Because now, what happens is all of my memories, all of my shit is from spending two hours up fucking there.
[333:46.50]Not down here.
[333:47.62]I haven't been down here in like an hour and 20 minutes.
[333:52.24]So now I'm like, okay, let me... Oh, wait, I forgot.
[333:54.48]I have to do this whole thing again.
[333:58.81]Fucking...
[334:14.91]Any memories?
[334:15.47]I have a few.
[334:25.40]Just cheat.
[334:26.98]No.
[334:29.04]No.
[334:29.86]It's just the dumb bird mechanic.
[334:33.88]Stupid ass bird.
[334:36.08]And that, I thought I could fall straight down.
[334:47.20]And I gotta go all the way back up through that stupid bullshit.
[334:50.20]Oh, man.
[334:51.06]I am... I might be defeated here very soon.
[334:59.75]I may be defeated.
[335:00.65]It really depends.
[335:06.25]It depends on how many times I have to do the beginning of the video game again.
[335:23.51]Streamer defeated.
[335:24.43]Streamer defeated.
[335:25.57]Oh, yeah, fuck, man.
[335:29.49]This sucks.
[335:30.11]I don't wanna do the green Ninja Turtle level again.
[335:34.28]But I have to.
[335:48.89]Remember when I was playing Simpsons Hit and Run?
[335:51.69]And I spent, what, like maybe two hours on that last two levels?
[335:54.07]You know what I'd say?
[335:55.19]I was like, oh, fuck this.
[335:56.33]I'm out of here.
[335:56.87]This is stupid.
[335:57.47]Fucking dumb.
[335:58.27]I hate this.
[335:59.69]And what did I do?
[336:00.27]I could continue to complain for like another three hours at that same mission.
[336:05.37]But after that, after about four hours, what did I do?
[336:14.32]That's right.
[336:14.70]That's right.
[336:17.77]I beat it.
[336:18.67]I finished it.
[336:24.96]I think this is a lot different than Simpsons Hit and Run, though.
[336:28.76]Because I don't have to go back and do the first mission of Simpsons Hit and Run.
[336:34.77]I don't have to go back to Chapter 1 in Simpsons Hit and Run.
[336:39.73]It might be a little different.
[337:02.51]I just want to get back up to the wind.
[337:04.21]I just want to see new content.
[337:05.95]I just have to get up there.
[337:07.35]I just have to get up there for a third fucking time.
[337:10.08]Ugh.
[337:11.52]Fucking get the coin.
[337:13.76]Oh my god.
[337:14.38]And that's what this all stems from.
[337:15.90]All of this stems from get the coin forehead.
[337:21.72]All of this.
[337:44.11]Let that be a lesson to all of you watching.
[337:51.09]Don't chase the money.
[337:55.90]It'll fucking destroy you.
[338:00.12]Maybe that's the message.
[338:25.86]That was- I- God damn it man, like it's just why- I don't understand.
[338:31.62]Like I don't understand man.
[338:33.28]I don't understand.
[338:35.89]Like why does it fucking- Come on man.
[338:38.73]What the fuck?
[338:40.47]What the fuck?
[338:42.67]It's just like- What the fuck man?
[338:52.26]What the fuck, man?
[338:54.14]What the fuck, man?
[339:05.09]Take the dev path?
[339:08.48]Yeah, I need- I want confirmation that the dev could beat his own Mario Maker level.
[339:21.29]Is there a hidden dev door in here?
[339:43.62]What happened?
[339:44.50]Oh.
[339:46.95]The only shortcut is in the sewers.
[339:49.39]Interesting.
[339:51.38]That dentist believed in me?
[339:52.71]Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
[339:57.45]If I get into a race with a horse, I'm gonna lose.
[340:03.72]You can believe in me all you want.
[341:11.27]Get me the fuck up here so I can at least accomplish the thing that I had.
[341:15.89]You got to stay calm.
[341:16.85]I know, I know.
[341:17.53]I'm gonna get this.
[341:18.13]I'll get this.
[341:18.61]I'll get this.
[341:19.59]I'll get this.
[341:20.17]I'll get it.
[341:20.65]I'm gonna get it.
[341:21.17]I'll get this.
[341:22.81]Hey, you know, I think maybe we should have some music.
[343:53.20]Stop!
[344:01.14]Play!
[344:19.48]Oh my god!
[344:20.39]Play!
[344:21.25]Play!
[344:22.33]Play!
[344:23.07]Play!
[344:23.93]Play!
[344:24.63]What is that?
[344:25.87]Play.
[344:29.15]Play.
[344:30.13]What's that?
[344:32.98]What's that mean?
[344:33.48]What is that from?
[344:35.60]Play.
[344:44.76]It's from a game.
[344:52.00]It's from Raid Shadow Legends.
[344:56.27]Why is that... Is that thing a meme because... Why is that such a meme?
[345:00.35]Can somebody explain that to me?
[345:06.76]Is it because... Is it about like a sponsorship thing?
[345:11.86]I'm pogging.
[345:13.02]Not yet.
[345:13.54]It's an adventure game.
[345:18.84]That jump sucks such an asshole, it really does.
[345:21.97]You gotta get, like, in the exact perfect fucking spot.
[345:25.69]I shouldn't have grabbed the fucking coin.
[345:29.27]I shouldn't have grabbed the coin.
[345:31.80]You know what I'm saying?
[345:32.90]This whole thing is avoided.
[345:34.62]Like, the last two and a half hours.
[345:36.94]If I just don't touch the coin, I will say it like a broken fucking record.
[345:59.74]Come on, give me a fucking break.
[346:01.28]Oh my god.
[346:27.17]Oh my god.
[346:28.23]I can't take it anymore.
[346:31.83]Yeah, play it.
[346:34.33]Play it.
[346:34.81]You'll see.
[346:57.47]Ay, ay, ay, okay.
[346:58.91]Alright.
[346:59.57]I'm ready.
[347:52.85]Let's go!
[347:56.61]No more Sporups.
[348:57.53]I didn't know!
[348:57.95]I didn't know!
[348:58.29]I didn't know!
[348:58.63]I didn't know!
[348:59.07]I didn't know!
[348:59.61]I actually didn't know!
[349:00.61]I didn't know what was over there.
[349:02.86]I didn't know what was... Wait, what?
[349:14.55]And now we go all the way back down.
[349:16.29]Like, yeah, now we just go all the way back down.
[349:18.09]Because, oh, hey, welcome to the new area.
[349:19.51]You're gonna screw up.
[349:20.05]Go all the way back down.
[349:22.93]Hey, this is a brand new zone, but like, who knows where the fuck you're supposed to jump.
[349:26.22]Did you miss?
[349:26.66]Go all the way back down.
[349:29.58]Haha, got you.
[349:50.26]Maybe charge trial and error?
[349:51.42]Maybe some, some, some, some progress?
[349:53.16]Maybe, maybe, no, no, just go all the way back down.
[349:55.12]Do you miss the jump that you didn't know existed and that you haven't seen before?
[349:57.80]Go all the way back down to the beginning of the game.
[350:00.56]Go, go, go, idiot, go, go!
[350:01.80]What are you, stupid?
[350:02.44]Ha ha!
[350:11.10]Oh my god, I actually got fucking stuck.
[350:18.55]Now here we are again.
[350:26.73]Hey, I made it to the snow level.
[350:28.43]No, go all the way back down to the beginning of the game.
[350:30.61]What are you talking about progress?
[350:34.45]No, no!
[350:35.27]Go back down to the beginning.
[350:36.90]You dope, what are you doing?
[350:41.22]You want to do all this again?
[350:42.90]Oh, he's mad.
[350:43.66]Yeah, he's mad.
[350:45.20]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[351:00.66]I can feel his rage.
[351:13.11]I'm not even sure it's rage.
[351:16.23]I think it's just... Why?
[351:19.15]Like, why?
[351:21.47]Why?!
[351:27.10]It's a qu- I'm just si-
[351:42.35]Ladies and gentlemen, we have breaking news here.
[351:44.41]Let's see how DERBO995, how he's doing after six hours.
[351:48.18]He's here with us now.
[351:49.64]He said he's not angry at all.
[351:50.88]He's asking a question.
[351:53.16]Let's see what that means.
[351:56.40]DERBO, are you here?
[352:03.53]Yes, yes, I am.
[352:06.67]I simply am asking the question.
[352:11.75]Why?!
[352:17.57]I'm not even red.
[352:23.18]God, dude.
[352:38.84]I wish that you could just not have to go down this far.
[352:41.32]Like, game, you know that I beat this part.
[352:44.61]You already know.
[352:45.25]You know I beat this part like 20,000 times.
[352:49.56]Do I have to jump through the chimney again?
[352:51.92]Do I have to do this again?
[352:53.18]I've done this already!
[353:09.31]This game doesn't care about your feelings.
[353:11.96]Yeah, I know we already talked about that new genre of video game, right?
[353:16.50]This great new genre called... I don't care you do it or don't do it.
[353:22.33]Eat the hot sauce.
[353:43.28]He's still talking about the hot... Yeah, alright.
[353:45.90]Alright.
[353:46.66]Uh... I... Uh... The snow level looks like it's a new mechanic that's been added.
[353:53.24]Uh, to further frustrate me.
[353:54.92]So, uh... I don't know.
[353:56.10]We'll see if I even get... At least I got to play Thunderstruck for like a fifth time and delete my whole VOD.
[354:00.42]So, you know.
[354:11.94]Yeah, at least I got to delete my entire Vaude by playing Thunderstruck five times.
[354:17.72]That was furious.
[354:18.66]Look, I went like this.
[354:19.84]Dun-dun!
[354:20.70]Right?
[354:21.00]That's transformative.
[354:21.84]It's furious.
[354:39.53]Become one with the game.
[354:57.18]Jerma, why couldn't we have played Mario?
[354:59.92]I don't think you want me to play Mario.
[355:10.05]I just... It's like so...
[355:23.96]Shit shit shit shit shit man You should watch other streamers rage at this
[355:47.45]That's what I've done.
[355:48.49]I've just marketing bait for this game.
[355:51.19]Don't you guys understand?
[355:52.11]I can end up in a compilation now somewhere.
[355:56.32]That's just like, no, fuck this.
[355:58.12]Fuck this game.
[355:58.96]This game's fucking, fucking stupid.
[356:02.44]I just ended up in a fucking marketing compilation.
[356:05.28]That's the long game.
[356:06.36]That's the con.
[356:15.03]Have you heard about that fucking game that's so hard that it made Jerma985 shit his pants on camera?
[356:22.40]And then it cuts to me like, dude, I fucking fell down for another time.
[356:27.37]Guys, I shit my pants.
[356:28.53]I gotta go.
[356:29.13]Fuck this game.
[357:00.42]It's not a compilation, it's just six hours of me.
[357:03.01]That would be so fucking funny.
[357:08.89]It's just me.
[357:17.54]Why would it just be me?
[357:26.36]Hard jumps!
[357:28.16]This is fucking stupid!
[357:32.27]Up to 10 hours of in-game content!
[357:35.63]This game sucks!
[357:41.21]Secrets!
[357:42.19]Don't get the coin!
[357:43.29]Don't get the fucking coin!
[357:46.62]You're gonna get mad.
[357:49.03]I've covered my hands with, with, with chocolate powder.
[357:58.00]Watch this asshole screw it up over and over again.
[358:14.93]Jump King.
[358:16.45]Get it on Steam.
[358:18.43]Where I guarantee you, half of all these reviews are meme reviews talking about how much they hated themselves while they played the game.
[358:37.56]Jump King.
[358:39.14]Get it on Steam.
[358:50.76]Get it on the steam sail.
[359:02.85]At least take a breather or play a relaxing game so you don't have a heart attack.
[359:09.15]Why not?
[359:10.21]Why?
[359:10.87]I- Alright.
[359:15.21]I'm not gonna have a fucking heart attack.
[359:17.09]I'm gonna be fine.
[359:26.77]Don't have a heart attack.
[359:31.03]Imagine you had, like, a heart attack while you played this.
[359:37.57]Is this like a...
[359:57.98]Oh no, heart attack.
[359:59.02]I'm not having a heart attack.
[360:05.54]Every fucking time, man.
[360:06.62]It's either a hair too short or a hair too high.
[360:10.15]And then you end up all the way back down here.
[360:12.71]And then, like, the whole thing's fucked up.
[360:25.91]We're talking hairs.
[360:28.41]We're talking literal hairs.
[360:31.63]On your head.
[360:36.07]Are if you fall down to the beginning of the game or not.
[360:40.64]I think that deserves a fucking meme review.
[360:47.74]Just link this stream.
[360:49.36]I make a Steam review.
[360:50.90]Just link this whole stream.
[360:53.33]This is kind of what you can expect.
[360:57.33]Ah, the music's good.
[360:59.37]Uh, the sound effects are good too, I guess.
[361:29.37]Dude, this game's not that hard, LOL.
[361:32.73]That's alright.
[361:33.27]Whatever.
[361:34.07]Alright.
[361:40.36]Okay.
[361:41.56]Okay.
[361:42.68]I guess.
[361:44.38]It's not.
[361:53.75]Dermot, do the fit where you fall at the beginning again.
[361:55.51]I love that.
[361:56.03]It was very funny.
[362:01.62]Dude, go to the bit where you fall to the end again.
[362:05.00]That was my favorite part of the stream.
[362:08.59]God damn it.
[362:11.35]Come on, why?
[362:16.20]If I go that far down again, that's it.
[362:37.78]This jump right here fucks me every time.
[362:43.19]Okay.
[362:44.83]Don't let us get down there again.
[362:46.65]I don't want to even see those platforms.
[362:51.80]Those platforms that are up here after this part.
[362:55.44]And then the snow shit.
[362:57.22]If you fall, you go all the way back down.
[363:40.48]Is wrong with that done that the same way every fucking time Fuck man, I fit you hold the button down the whole time He's beginning to believe no, I'm not even close I Mean I'm beginning to believe to turn the game off and turn the stream off That's what you mean
[364:08.61]I'm beginning to believe that one.
[364:10.99]I'm believing that one.
[364:12.55]Again.
[364:13.07]It happened again.
[364:14.27]Again.
[364:14.81]For the second time in a row.
[364:20.45]You just hold the... You hold the jump the whole way and go left.
[364:27.30]Why did that not work twice in a row now?
[364:31.90]Hold the button.
[364:39.28]What is going on?
[364:43.26]What the fuck, man?
[364:49.22]Four percent.
[364:51.78]How many people have beaten Dark Souls?
[364:53.44]Like, on, like, PlayStation trophies?
[364:54.86]It's because I'm too far to the edge.
[365:03.37]At least three?
[365:04.63]Probably at least three.
[365:21.88]We are at, let us pog.
[365:23.44]Oops.
[365:47.96]I'm gonna take this so slow.
[365:50.14]Have I eaten anything?
[365:50.86]Yes, I have.
[365:51.74]I ate earlier today.
[365:53.44]Like, right before the stream started.
[365:56.50]Had some, uh... I don't even know.
[365:58.22]What did I eat?
[365:58.90]Something.
[366:03.07]I have no progress.
[366:04.37]I have no pog-gress, and I must pog.
[366:09.57]That's a pretty good one, actually.
[366:21.83]Okay, for the love of God.
[366:41.87]Omega LOL, not like this.
[366:43.63]Don't give in to cynicism.
[366:44.97]Uh, isn't this whole game based on cynicism and torturing yourself?
[366:50.07]That's the whole point of the game.
[367:10.97]It's pog and what was it torture?
[367:12.62]What was it?
[367:32.07]Oh my fucking god.
[367:41.76]I'm starting to move with the controller now, which means I'm really trying.
[367:49.35]Are you having fun?
[367:51.43]Uh, kind of.
[367:54.83]I was.
[367:56.32]And then that fun like translated into just accepting that I'm here.
[368:11.28]I'm just here.
[368:13.34]Why?
[368:14.00]If it's not fun.
[368:15.08]No, it is.
[368:17.48]I'm having fun.
[368:21.14]I'm at stage five fun acceptance.
[368:24.32]Stop.
[368:25.11]That's funny.
[368:26.33]But no, it's... Don't go all the way down.
[368:36.79]Fuck me, man.
[368:44.23]We're bound to fall.
[368:45.67]Okay, I'm reading chat and not playing the game.
[368:49.88]Let's stop that for now.
[368:53.18]Just do the DLC.
[368:53.98]You can't fall down as far.
[368:56.99]So is the DLC just better than this?
[369:05.23]It's harder.
[369:05.95]Oh god, I don't want to play it.
[369:18.73]Relax.
[369:25.39]Very funny.
[369:25.91]New level you won't see.
[369:27.19]Just unplug the PC.
[369:37.08]That's a great spam.
[369:39.68]That's a really good spam the streamer.
[369:53.65]too far I wish I could just have a system where I could just be able to attempt it again just bounce over here yeah once I get to up to the snow again we fall down again it's over
[370:20.94]I'm gonna go eat, like, a bag of McDonald's.
[370:32.49]Gross.
[370:33.37]Actually, yeah.
[370:33.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[370:34.48]That's a bad idea.
[370:38.52]That's not even... Yeah, that's not... How would I do that?
[371:07.92]Alright, snow level time.
[371:23.20]Just get up here.
[371:44.17]Alright.
[371:45.39]Alright.
[371:45.81]Alright.
[371:46.21]It's time to go.
[371:49.17]It's time to go.
[371:50.15]It's time to go.
[371:51.27]This is just... This ain't up my alley.
[371:54.27]You know what I mean?
[371:54.93]This ain't up my alley.
[371:55.81]This is not like this ain't up my alley.
[371:57.27]This ain't up the alley.
[372:00.76]This ain't up the alley.
[372:01.54]What did I get?
[372:02.38]25% of the ways through this game?
[372:10.38]Gamer license gone.
[372:11.36]No, this is not a game.
[372:12.12]This is a non-canon gamer license game.
[372:14.72]Not even close.
[372:18.02]This is like the extended universe for getting extra stamps on your gamer license.
[372:23.12]Not even getting one.
[372:27.18]I'm halfway through the game?
[372:28.16]What?
[372:30.14]No, I'm not.
[372:36.86]You are.
[372:40.19]What are you talking about?
[372:43.07]I'm halfway to my gamer license?
[372:53.21]What?
[373:02.23]Are you kidding me?
[373:06.58]No fucking way.
[373:07.66]We're halfway?
[373:08.24]Halfway?
[373:11.84]No, I don't believe you.
[373:15.68]I don't believe you.
[373:19.25]Could we be that close, though?
[373:20.97]I mean, what would we do if we were that close?
[373:23.31]We would probably maybe get a couple, maybe get some tunes on.
[374:01.35]Guys, this game is way too hard for me.
[374:04.34]It just is.
[374:04.94]I've been trying to fight with saying like, hey, is this game nearly impossible for me to complete?
[374:09.74]No, only 4% of all humans.
[374:13.04]No, I'm one of those 4% of all human beings.
[374:16.33]Yeah, that's me.
[374:17.89]That's me.
[374:18.45]I'll be up there with the trophy.
[374:20.11]No.
[374:20.93]No.
[374:26.96]I mean, my gamer skill at this point is literally like being able to read Kingdom Hearts 3 dialog.
[374:31.87]So, like, no.
[374:33.87]I don't think so.
[374:42.97]You want the trophy?
[374:44.23]You go get it.
[374:45.20]You go get it.
[374:46.40]And then we can have a conversation about how many teeth you have left.
[374:51.60]Because they're all going to be gone when you're done playing this one.
[375:26.10]Fuck that jump.
[375:27.24]And fuck this one, too.
[375:33.65]Oh, what's that?
[375:34.05]Hold on.
[375:34.25]Let me, let me.
[375:34.85]What's on the top of my head?
[375:36.83]Oh, that was a hair?
[375:38.19]Oh.
[375:40.43]Jump King.
[375:41.15]The video game.
[375:42.21]There.
[375:42.49]Just put it down on the table.
[376:00.45]You're going to play this next stream, right?
[376:03.27]No, I will never play this again.
[376:05.86]What you see tonight is what you get.
[376:09.54]I am ever, ever going to open this game.
[376:13.12]Ever again.
[376:15.78]If somebody came in the stream right now and said, Hey dude, I'm like a huge fan of Jump King.
[376:19.32]I'll pay you $50,000 right now to continue playing it tomorrow.
[376:23.25]I'd say, No.
[376:25.39]No.
[376:30.18]I'd say yes.
[376:30.70]I'm just kidding.
[376:31.22]Definitely would say yes.
[376:33.35]I would absolutely say yes.
[376:34.43]Like, immediately.
[376:35.07]It would probably be less, way less than that.
[376:37.45]It'd be like, way, way, way, way less than that.
[376:46.17]24 hour Jump King stream?
[376:47.73]Are you trying to kill me?
[376:50.05]That's how you kill someone.
[376:54.02]That's how, that's how you die.
[377:09.55]No, you guys are trying to truth serum me.
[377:12.94]You think that, like, the more that I play, and the more of this, like, drug game that I take in, and the more, like, fucked up I become, oh, there we go, now let's get some secrets out of him.
[377:22.91]Mm-mm.
[377:50.76]Is this too far?
[377:52.78]Too... Oh, I need to be up there.
[377:55.48]God damn it.
[377:56.22]Like, it's so easy to fuck this up.
[377:59.91]It's so easy to fuck everything in this game up.
[378:02.77]It's so easy.
[378:08.77]This is like playing Getting Over It, but you're sitting on a bed of nails.
[378:14.90]Like, it's real easy for you to shimmy and be like, God damn... Ow!
[378:17.38]Ow!
[378:39.83]I just want to see the snow one more time.
[378:42.14]I'm not going to be able to.
[378:43.08]I'm not going to be able to.
[378:44.74]I got memed in the meme game.
[378:46.16]Yeah, yeah.
[378:47.00]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[378:48.34]See you guys later.
[378:52.52]See you tomorrow.
[378:53.34]It's been fun.
[378:54.46]See you guys tomorrow.
[378:56.78]Lots of exciting things going on tomorrow.
[379:00.27]Absolutely not Jump King.
[379:02.39]Literally ever again.
[379:04.13]Just like, I mean, like actually.
[379:05.93]Like actually.
[379:06.75]Just never fucking again.
[379:08.09]Ever again.
[379:11.41]Ever.
[379:11.79]Again.
[379:12.11]Like, just... I mean, we're talking never again?
[379:14.75]Like, a 0% chance.
[379:16.23]You know, take that 50 grand and shove it.
[379:22.43]Fuck it.
[379:23.05]I don't want it.
[379:23.71]I'm not taking it.
[379:37.88]Uh, so...
[380:08.69]If I tilt my monitor upside down, you've been doing really well.
[380:13.29]Right.
[380:31.53]I'm telling you, you guys are fucking hilarious.
[380:36.86]You guys say some of the funniest shit, I swear to god.
[380:54.22]No.
[380:57.13]It's like, you know when you get deja vu?
[381:00.94]Just like over, I'm just over and over again getting deja vu, like you've just, you've been here before.
[381:07.41]Like motherfucker, you've been here before, you've done this already a bunch of times, you've been here before!
[381:25.52]And even though I've been here before, you still get lost.
[381:31.82]Watch the speedrun.
[381:34.52]I don't want to watch a speedrun of a game that I can't... I can't do.
[381:41.08]Because then I... It's spoilers.
[381:43.76]And I mean, I'm never playing this game literally ever again.
[381:48.52]But I'm playing it tonight.
[381:50.52]I'm still here.
[381:54.62]Guys, it's all bullshit.
[381:55.90]I'm just trying to make myself have to focus.
[381:58.43]You know what I'm saying?
[382:05.98]I'm like, I'm like bargaining with my own body, my own brain.
[382:10.76]That's, that's where you, yeah, if you fall there, uh, yeah, yeah, if you fall there, you, you said you fucked the whole thing up.
[382:17.96]Remember, if you do one mistake on one jump, it's specifically some of the, it ruins the entire thing.
[382:26.47]You know.
[382:33.22]Can't wait for it in ten years.
[382:34.86]Competitive eSport teeth pulling.
[382:37.37]Yeah, it's gonna be great.
[382:44.99]Or who can hit themselves in the face with a chair harder?
[382:49.93]Looks like... Ah, we got a... Me.
[382:56.73]Me!
[383:14.98]The new episode of The Mandalorian looks great.
[383:20.36]Yeah, I'm gonna have to call it here soon.
[383:22.06]I'm getting to the point where I don't want to see these images again.
[383:26.26]You know what I mean?
[383:28.68]It's getting close.
[383:29.68]It's not there yet, but it'll be there probably soon.
[383:34.00]I don't want to see the fucking birds in the background here anymore.
[383:36.82]Like, I don't want to see this anymore.
[383:38.76]You know what I mean?
[383:43.52]It's like I'm replaying the same level over and over again.
[383:47.36]It's like, I played level 2.
[383:48.70]I don't want to see level 2 no more.
[383:50.76]When you start winning, that's not true.
[384:01.73]Because even if you do start winning, that's the beauty of this game.
[384:05.26]Even if you do win, eventually you're going to miss a jump and come back to level 2.
[384:11.81]You will see level two again, my friend.
[384:13.61]Oh, yes, you will.
[384:14.95]Many times.
[384:28.77]He thinks he's not going to see level two again.
[384:46.60]You're getting better?
[384:49.86]I don't think so.
[384:51.26]I think I've devolved.
[385:06.45]Am I getting better?
[385:07.81]Do you actually think so?
[385:11.91]Am I getting better?
[385:12.49]Am I 50% of the way through the game?
[385:15.60]What's the point of leaving then?
[385:17.80]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[385:20.02]Why?
[385:20.44]I did the same thing I did last time.
[385:22.47]I did the same thing I did last time.
[385:23.53]I just wish it didn't go that far down.
[385:25.25]Like, I did the same damn thing I did last time.
[385:28.25]Just overshot it, and now we go all the way back down.
[385:32.97]And now we go all the way back down again.
[385:34.07]Hey, back to level one.
[385:38.81]That's it.
[385:39.56]Goodbye.
[385:43.13]That's it.
[385:44.14]I have to leave.
[385:45.66]I don't want to do this again.
[385:46.98]This is dumb.
[385:48.08]I don't want to do this again.
[385:54.92]Somebody came in and said, dude, this game is literal insanity.
[385:58.18]Now I see what you mean by that.
[386:09.18]Your concentration gets maxed out.
[386:11.00]Yeah, you get to, you just, everything just starts to blend together and you don't want to see the crows anymore.
[386:15.57]You don't want to see the green sewer anymore.
[386:17.87]And you, yeah, everything just maxes out.
[386:20.23]There's a finite amount of human brain energy.
[386:24.71]Oh man.
[386:25.29]I, why do I want to beat this?
[386:28.24]What is doing this to me?
[386:30.24]I don't want, I don't care.
[386:31.68]What, I, what do I care?
[386:33.08]I don't even care.
[386:48.52]Let it go, Jeremy.
[386:49.73]Let it go.
[386:50.43]I can't.
[386:51.09]I can't let it go.
[386:51.95]It's only been six and a half hours.
[386:53.53]It's not that long.
[386:55.19]Oh my fucking god.
[386:59.83]Like, just... That's just... I'm going to be in bed tonight.
[387:06.16]I'm going to be fucking furious.
[387:08.20]Because I'm just going to be like, God damn it.
[387:10.14]I could have gone farther.
[387:15.30]I could have gone further, you know what I mean?
[387:16.81]I could have done it, and I'm not going to have nightmares.
[387:25.49]Okay.
[387:32.16]We may have reached the maximum brain capacity, though.
[387:35.98]On the second or third thunderstruck that, I think we were at the end.
[387:39.63]Yeah.
[387:40.19]Like, at Thunderstruck replay number two is when I maxed out every ounce of my concentration.
[387:49.43]So, we did play, what, like three or four more times?
[387:54.99]You know, I bet you... Don't say it, Jeremy.
[388:00.43]Don't.
[388:01.11]Don't do it.
[388:03.73]Don't do it.
[388:04.41]Don't say it.
[388:05.34]Don't say it.
[388:08.04]Don't say it.
[388:08.72]Yeah, I'm gonna say it.
[388:09.58]I'm gonna say it.
[388:10.28]If I had... If I had... If I... If I had sleep and I came back and I had... I would... Don't say it.
[388:19.16]I'm not gonna say it.
[388:21.72]Don't say it.
[388:22.22]Don't do it.
[388:30.46]If I slept on it... If I... If I...
[388:35.78]Yeah, if I slept on it, I was 50... If I was 50% of the way through the game.
[388:41.96]If I sleep on it and I come back with... And I'm gonna eat a bunch of fucking cereal and shit.
[388:50.01]I'm gonna eat like... I'm gonna take like a riboflavin extract.
[388:54.07]I'm gonna take like a B vitamin complex multivitamin.
[389:02.57]We're playing it tomorrow.
[389:07.52]I'm going to take B vitamins and I'm going to do it.
[389:10.41]I will beat it.
[389:22.34]I just, I need, I just need energy.
[389:23.72]I need just like brain energy.
[389:25.29]You know what I mean?
[389:25.77]Because look, I, as much as it's hard, I know, I know this shit.
[389:30.19]And if I came back, if I listened to Thunderstruck on repeat with just earbuds into my, as far as I can shove them into my ears on max volume on repeat for the next 12 hours in bed, I think I could do it.
[389:50.63]Let me just get up here.
[389:54.21]Well, I have a question.
[389:55.87]If you save and exit, does it go where you are?
[390:00.70]Like, will it remember where I am?
[390:02.22]Or do I have to start from the beginning?
[390:09.30]Does it matter?
[390:09.80]I mean, kind of.
[390:12.09]Don't let the game defeat me?
[390:13.15]No, I'm not.
[390:13.73]No, no, no.
[390:14.37]I mean, I'm just talking bullshit.
[390:16.61]You know what I mean?
[390:17.21]Like, I'm just kidding around.
[390:18.99]This guy...
[390:22.84]There's two people talking right now.
[390:24.02]I don't want to play this tomorrow.
[390:27.31]I don't want to do... I don't want to play this tomorrow.
[390:30.59]Somebody else is talking.
[390:31.99]Don't listen to that person.
[390:33.55]They're absolutely incorrect.
[390:35.61]I don't want to do this.
[390:36.25]I don't want to play this.
[390:38.37]Why would I play this tomorrow?
[390:39.23]It's Fight Club.
[390:51.16]You know what I mean?
[390:53.42]Don't listen to that guy.
[390:54.24]Holy shit.
[391:04.59]AmnisticOW.
[391:07.55]Just gave 50 community subs.
[391:10.47]My goodness.
[391:14.12]That's a lot of subs.
[391:16.86]Thank you, seriously.
[391:19.25]Dodged again?
[391:19.99]Damn, that's a lot.
[391:21.19]That means you have to keep playing.
[391:22.59]Tomorrow we will.
[391:23.37]Let me just get to a position where I can save it.
[391:28.75]Uh... And Mestic, you also gave shit earlier too, so... That's a lot of subs.
[391:40.25]Which one's the real Jeremy?
[391:41.61]I told you that somebody came back in time and tried to stop me from getting the coin.
[391:45.82]We've been switching controllers ever since.
[392:04.76]Let the good Jeremy play the game?
[392:06.96]Um... Good as in, like, a good person?
[392:09.83]Or, like, good as in good at the game?
[392:10.97]Because it's good and evil.
[392:13.93]There's two of us here.
[392:14.91]I have good and evil in me.
[392:16.63]Oh, fuck.
[392:17.87]I'm sorry.
[392:30.69]I have... Yeah, I have... I'm good, but I'm also evil too.
[392:42.31]That should have been it.
[392:43.53]You know, that should have been it.
[392:45.61]Dog shit.
[392:47.27]Dog shit.
[392:48.45]Dog shit.
[392:49.51]Can we get a new emote called dog shit?
[392:54.33]What the fuck was wrong with that one?
[392:55.83]Dog shit.
[393:10.13]Alright, I've gotten back up here.
[393:11.93]What is it, six and a half hours?
[393:13.87]Damn, okay, that's pretty long.
[393:15.79]That's not that long, though.
[393:19.89]Am I alright?
[393:23.37]Yeah.
[393:25.89]Yeah, okay, alright.
[393:29.31]Let me just try to... Hold on.
[393:31.59]Why am I so addicted to this game?
[393:50.20]Alright, we're back up here.
[394:31.93]Not enough.
[394:32.64]Not enough.
[394:35.88]Not enough.
[394:36.76]You think you're on a flow, but then the game's just fucking unbearable.
[394:43.18]It's fucking unbearable.
[394:44.70]This is unbearable.
[394:47.45]This is unbearable.
[394:50.21]Right, Jeremy from four hours ago?
[394:52.01]Oh, it's unbearable.
[394:53.59]Yes, thank you for summoning me.
[394:55.71]It's unbearable.
[394:58.61]Jeremy didn't stop playing.
[394:59.67]No, it's...
[395:02.53]I won't do that.
[395:04.73]Why would I do that?
[395:05.85]I knew I should have held it for a tad longer.
[395:38.04]Yeah, okay, so now at this stage here, if I fall down again, it's over.
[395:46.35]If I get up to the snow area, we can stop.
[395:48.23]And I can just save it.
[395:48.97]And please tell me that if I haven't met that snow area, that that's it.
[395:52.13]And I can save it there.
[395:53.54]Right?
[395:55.50]Will it actually open up tomorrow there?
[396:10.76]It does not.
[396:15.15]Really?
[396:15.41]It says you can save the game.
[396:18.19]I'll be surprised if you can't do that.
[396:21.34]It will open up wherever you are.
[396:23.34]Yeah, okay.
[396:23.58]I was going to say, why would there be a save button?
[397:08.15]Too much, too much, too much.
[397:15.80]God damn it.
[397:19.58]That's it, that's it.
[397:21.77]Okay, that's it.
[397:24.45]Alright, guys.
[397:27.27]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[397:28.57]We'll see who wins the fight tomorrow in my nightmares.
[397:34.91]Is Rational Jerma going to win this battle, or is Jump King Jerma going to win that battle?
[397:39.71]You know what I mean?
[397:45.52]I don't know.
[397:46.98]At this point, it's completely up in the air.
[397:50.88]They're going to be fighting all night.
[397:58.67]It ain't gonna end well.
[398:31.76]Hey boys, heading up!
[398:39.93]Just kidding.
[398:43.25]Okay, so I just want to get up here.
[398:48.31]Just want to get up here, that's it.
[398:50.39]Just want to get right here.
[398:51.31]Now, what's the worst, what's the way to go?
[398:57.20]Save, you idiot.
[398:58.38]I know, I know this is a mistake.
[399:02.79]I'm up here, but hold on.
[399:03.63]Where am I?
[399:04.59]What was that explosion?
[399:05.83]What was that explosion for?
[399:17.40]Okay, so I go... You jump up, and then just get carried into there.
[399:26.67]Probably from...
[399:38.03]I got an idea.
[399:50.98]But should I go with the wind or without the wind?
[399:54.86]I shouldn't have gone.
[399:55.72]I'm fine.
[400:09.93]I, um... Like that?
[400:15.17]Fuck yeah!
[400:16.61]Fuck yeah, fuck yeah.
[400:35.70]Now, with...
[400:38.20]What about straight up?
[400:40.04]Yeah, I think that's the play.
[400:41.13]Straight up in the air.
[400:42.25]Fly.
[400:47.67]Oh my goodness, I did it.
[400:48.75]I did it.
[400:49.15]I did it.
[400:52.13]But I don't know what's up here.
[400:55.89]Oh my god.
[400:57.70]Okay.
[400:58.50]It's going well.
[400:59.12]50% of the way through the game?
[401:02.52]Release the pugs.
[401:07.78]That's not snow, though.
[401:21.73]That's from the Ninja Turtles.
[401:24.07]Turtles in Time.
[401:25.75]That's how Shredder laughs.
[401:51.49]I can't walk.
[401:54.23]I gotta get over there.
[401:55.81]I gotta get over there.
[401:57.19]But this is gonna drop me straight down.
[402:01.86]I don't know the trajectory.
[402:02.78]I really don't.
[402:06.98]Fuck.
[402:08.14]Will I make it into the snow?
[402:09.26]Okay.
[402:11.64]Then we go straight in the air.
[402:13.12]And get carried over to that side.
[402:19.27]Oh my fucking god.
[402:25.82]I can't walk.
[402:33.91]Okay.
[402:34.47]Fire, fire, fire.
[402:35.87]Shut up, idiot.
[402:37.45]Yeah, okay, idiot.
[403:03.71]If I get stuck... I'm not sure.
[403:08.69]I gotta jump into the wind.
[403:11.83]I just got raided?
[403:13.05]Oh shit!
[403:13.93]I just got raided!
[403:15.43]Raided right now during the middle of me trying... Oh god!
[403:22.40]Thanks for the raid!
[403:23.54]That was Ludwig.
[403:25.32]Holy shit.
[403:28.22]Welcome everybody.
[403:29.00]No, I can't stop!
[403:35.81]Thank you.
[403:36.15]I don't know.
[403:36.59]I'm not sure where you guys came from.
[403:38.81]What you were doing, but welcome.
[403:41.13]What's going on?
[403:43.16]I'm currently playing a game called Jump King.
[403:46.42]It's really, really fun.
[403:48.14]I can promise you that.
[403:49.26]It's a fun game.
[403:50.50]I was not 10 minutes ago talking about how I hated the game and I was not going to play it ever again.
[403:56.77]And I was going to end the stream.
[403:58.41]That didn't happen.
[403:59.05]None of that happened.
[403:59.63]Don't listen to anybody in the chat that says otherwise.
[404:01.51]They're just a bunch of fucking goofers.
[404:03.65]You know what I mean?
[404:05.20]But, thank you Ludwig.
[404:07.16]Uh, really appreciate that.
[404:08.04]Let's go.
[404:08.36]Pause the game?
[404:11.00]Oh, you would like to see.
[404:11.72]Yeah, there you go.
[404:18.63]I appreciate it, though.
[404:20.25]Welcome to the stream.
[404:26.85]800 and... That's actually kind of an interesting number. 8811811.
[404:33.79]I have to make a move here.
[404:35.69]I gotta make a move here.
[404:38.87]I'm gonna jump into the wind from here.
[404:41.41]A big one.
[404:46.64]And now I'm going from here.
[404:48.18]I'm gonna say it's gonna have to be a big one.
[404:52.30]Ay-yi-yi.
[404:53.48]Up in the air.
[404:53.96]Straight in the air.
[404:59.46]Okay.
[405:00.34]Now what the hell do I do?
[405:05.25]Um... Shit.
[405:10.17]Are these enemies?
[405:10.77]I think they're just... Watch.
[405:12.39]I tried to jump into one of them and talk to them, and I fell down all the way to the beginning of the game, so... Jump on the left one.
[405:21.89]First, let me just do a little hop so I can... I wonder if I... Go on the one on the left.
[405:31.50]Ay-yi-yi.
[405:32.38]Hold on.
[405:34.21]Save and reload?
[405:35.17]Quit the game?
[405:35.59]Why?
[405:35.75]I think this is a good spot.
[405:42.32]This is a good spot!
[405:42.98]Good spot!
[405:43.36]Good spot!
[405:43.72]Good spot!
[405:44.64]Almost.
[405:52.74]I think this is the one.
[405:53.30]I didn't jump high enough.
[406:00.25]Pay attention to the wind.
[406:02.71]I am.
[406:03.85]I'm just trying to get in a spot where I can get up there.
[406:06.89]Here we go.
[406:07.33]Ready?
[406:08.29]Let's try it.
[406:10.61]Ladies and gentlemen.
[406:12.35]I just did that.
[406:13.11]I just did it.
[406:13.89]I'm up here.
[406:14.51]Now what the hell do I do?
[406:21.94]To the right.
[406:23.10]A huge jump to the right.
[406:26.77]The right?
[406:28.15]To the right?
[406:29.29]The left or the right?
[406:30.04]The right?
[406:31.12]Jump with the wind to the right.
[406:32.52]Big, huge, full jump.
[406:34.40]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[406:37.10]I'm going for it.
[406:37.82]Max jump with the wind.
[406:45.51]Oh, it's... Oh, that... Oh.
[406:47.73]Oh.
[406:49.43]Oh.
[406:50.09]Oh.
[407:24.07]I can get up there.
[407:29.71]No, Jeremy, what are you thinking?
[407:34.19]Jeremy, what the hell are you doing?
[407:35.68]What am I doing?
[407:36.50]What the hell are you doing?
[407:39.28]The fuck are you doing?
[407:47.83]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[408:02.22]Okay, relax.
[408:11.88]I really want to get over... Jesus.
[408:20.08]There it is.
[408:20.38]Alright, we're good?
[408:30.71]Oh my god, what the hell are you thinking?
[408:37.11]Don't choke and be... Quit choking.
[408:38.93]What do you mean?
[408:39.87]I'm at the snow level.
[408:40.99]This is the longest I've been up here.
[408:43.84]Those of you that just joined the stream...
[408:47.28]I've had a lot of problems down there.
[408:49.70]I don't want to go back down there.
[408:51.46]I'm doing everything possible to not fall down there.
[409:08.10]Alright, let's do this again.
[409:09.68]So you're saying...
[409:16.30]More community subs.
[409:18.76]Nondescript civilian.
[409:20.70]Ten more community subs.
[409:21.96]Thank you.
[409:23.60]Damn.
[409:26.54]I'm scared to a full jump.
[409:29.74]Thank you so much, nondescript civilian.
[409:33.00]This is the spot, right?
[409:39.85]Fuck.
[409:40.99]Is this good, though?
[409:42.45]Maybe not a full jump.
[409:47.14]Fuck.
[409:47.90]It's not a full jump.
[409:49.02]It's not a full jump.
[409:49.90]It's a little bit... It's a little less than a full jump.
[409:55.62]It's not a full jump.
[409:59.04]Damn it.
[409:59.94]Damn it.
[410:04.02]Creatures!
[410:06.67]Thanks for the five community subs creatures rule.
[410:10.05]Five more coming in.
[410:12.93]Oh dear.
[410:18.15]More subs, yeah.
[410:26.37]That's not good for me.
[410:28.78]That's not good for me.
[410:30.68]I gotta catch it before the snow moves.
[410:33.58]Like, for instance, one, two, three, go now.
[410:37.08]There we go.
[410:38.71]Okay, is this good?
[410:41.43]I feel like it's not good enough.
[410:44.90]Oh shit.
[410:45.64]Okay.
[410:46.22]Not a full jump.
[410:47.05]Not a full jump.
[410:47.71]Not a full jump.
[410:48.27]Not a full jump.
[410:48.81]Not a full jump.
[410:52.49]Oh!
[410:52.87]Now what?
[410:54.51]Straight up in the air?
[410:55.59]I don't know.
[411:00.51]Jump to the left or jump up?
[411:07.33]I wonder if I can make it.
[411:08.03]Oh!
[411:10.99]Oh!
[411:18.57]I'm panicking.
[411:19.83]That was a panic attack.
[411:25.20]Well, I know.
[411:25.96]I fucking panicked.
[411:29.82]It's okay.
[411:30.18]We're good.
[411:43.46]god damn it oh am I up I don't know straight up trying to get to the right you think but then okay hold on I don't know when to go oh my god it saved me ready
[412:11.39]Nope.

[412:17.29]You gotta wall bounce real hard.
[412:23.64]Do you, though?
[412:25.34]I don't know.
[412:28.58]Um... I don't know.
[412:35.92]I can't go up from here.
[412:38.62]Uh...
[412:41.90]Up and to the right, I know, but I don't... Should I jump up when the wind is blowing left is when I should do it?
[412:52.75]Right?
[412:52.97]Here we go.
[412:58.15]Let's see if it works.
[413:04.27]Cross your fingers.
[413:10.15]Oh my god.
[413:12.19]Okay.
[413:14.04]Um... I think I go just a little bit just up, or a small little jump to the left.
[413:26.33]Done.
[413:27.55]And then we go all straight up in the air.
[413:40.84]Holy shit.
[413:41.84]It never ends.
[413:42.56]It never ends.
[413:44.50]This is horrible.
[413:46.10]God damn it, man.
[413:50.77]I don't think I'm in a good spot.
[414:04.27]It's just a small... I'm gonna hit my head on the ceiling.
[414:09.42]Here we go.
[414:13.98]My god, oh my god.
[414:16.56]Oh my god.

[415:04.68]I didn't want to go with the wind because I didn't want to get blown too far.
[415:06.94]I just didn't hold the button long enough.
[415:08.41]It's alright.
[415:09.45]It's alright.
[415:09.71]I'm not that far back.
[415:11.13]Oh, I could get... I could just say scream or fucking swear.

[415:20.39]Hold on.
[415:37.30]Oh, it's so... Okay, I'm gonna stay calm.
[415:45.58]Don't do a full jump.
[415:51.71]It's close.
[415:58.23]Same deal.
[415:58.93]How the hell did I even get up there?
[416:00.27]I don't even remember.
[416:05.97]It was a full to the right, but I gotta get over there first.
[416:09.39]Nope.
[416:10.33]Shit.
[416:11.43]That was a bad- I was in a terrible spot.
[416:12.91]It was a really bad spot.
[416:24.52]This is not a good spot either.
[416:41.41]Smile, I'm smiling.
[416:44.82]Little jump.
[416:45.68]Just a little one.
[416:50.16]It's in a bad spot.
[416:50.98]Uh-oh.
[416:52.84]I don't think it's not going to take me up there.
[417:00.35]I don't think it'll take me up.
[417:07.95]Here we go again.
[417:11.27]Full jump to the right.
[417:12.95]Into the wind.
[417:13.57]Let's go.
[417:24.77]Y'all gonna think I'm crazy for this?
[417:37.19]Oh, god damn it.
[417:39.97]I was just trying to get over there without the wind.
[417:45.78]This is hell.
[417:48.92]This is actually hell.
[417:54.34]Are you serious?
[418:03.39]What are you talking about?
[418:04.97]What are you talking about?
[418:08.99]What are you talking about?
[418:23.74]Jerma, please, you got this.
[418:25.66]I don't know.
[418:26.08]I don't know.
[418:48.03]Ay-yi-yi.
[418:49.31]Come on, man.
[418:55.56]Get up there.
[418:56.10]Alright, now can I please?
[419:06.42]No!
[419:06.92]Why?
[419:07.22]The wind won't grab me!
[419:09.44]Why won't it grab me in that spot?
[419:10.83]Do I have to go up?
[419:15.19]I don't understand.
[419:27.87]Shitty spot.
[419:28.54]I have to just go for it.
[419:36.44]I can't really get out of this.
[419:56.47]Okay.
[420:00.15]I'm trying to get in that spot over there.
[420:02.75]Go eat a brownie?
[420:03.53]That would be pretty good.
[420:04.75]I'd like that.
[420:08.37]Good.
[420:12.64]Again.
[420:14.18]Can I do this shit again, please?
[420:18.46]Here we go.
[420:30.99]That was in full... What happened?
[420:34.93]What's going on?
[420:37.19]I just did a full jump.
[420:38.21]I didn't do anything else.
[420:39.63]I just held down A. I think I have to get to the second ledge, I think.
[420:53.43]What the fuck?
[420:56.55]Just keep jumping.
[420:57.29]Just keep jumping.
[421:11.23]Fuck.
[421:14.09]Jump in the air is neutral?
[421:15.29]That's not a bad idea.
[421:24.80]I have to get in a better spot than this.
[421:28.25]That's not a better spot.
[421:54.10]Oh man.
[421:54.62]There's so many opportunities for you to fall in that snow level.
[422:02.89]Holy shit, man.
[422:04.15]This game is something else, I'll tell you.
[422:07.85]This game is something else.
[422:28.78]No, this game is something else.
[422:42.07]Ah, see you tomorrow.
[422:44.93]That was as close as I was going to get.
[422:46.47]See you tomorrow.
[422:55.19]Yeah, that's it.
[422:56.52]That's it.
[422:57.58]We'll see what I do tomorrow.
[422:59.20]I'm going to get in a fight with myself and my brain.
[423:04.44]I don't want to fall down from here.
[423:05.80]I don't want to do that bullshit again.
[423:07.26]I don't want to do that bullshit down there again.
[423:10.47]You saw how I acted.
[423:19.23]You know, you can always tell when I'm at... Okay, I don't want to fall down here.
[423:22.74]Save game.
[423:23.12]Exit.
[423:23.34]Done.
[423:24.16]Bye.
[423:31.69]I don't know what I'm talking about.
[424:14.26]I just wanted to see what happened.
[424:24.57]I just wanted to see what it looked like.
[424:25.87]I just wanted to make sure people weren't lying to me.
[424:28.58]And I lost progress too.
[424:30.20]Fuck me.
[424:30.88]Wait, what do you mean why did I save?
[424:42.85]It's not that far.
[424:43.91]It's like one screen down.
[424:46.43]It's not a big deal.
[424:47.29]Do you know how many times I did those two screens?
[424:51.81]Way too many times.
[424:56.45]Wait, you can save scum the game?
[424:59.97]What?
[425:03.13]What?
[425:09.64]What are you talking about?
[425:10.56]Hold on.
[425:14.95]What do you mean?
[425:22.05]If I fall down right now and I exit the game and don't save, will I come back here?
[425:32.35]You can't.
[425:32.83]Don't get your baby.
[425:33.63]Okay, fine.
[425:42.01]We'll see if I play it tomorrow.
[425:43.62]I don't know.
[425:46.25]We're gonna have to be in a mood to play it.
[425:48.56]We'll see what we do tomorrow.
[425:50.82]Thanks for watching, though.
[425:54.52]It's been fun.
[425:55.86]No, I only exit the game, though.
[426:08.03]That's so many falls.
[426:11.46]Oh my god.
[426:12.18]I feel like I get hit by like a train.
[426:23.61]Where's the achievements?
[426:27.31]Um, I don't even know where they are.
[426:32.46]The last few stages are incredibly difficult.
[426:40.21]No, that's, that's, I, that's... It was, that was fun, but I'm dead.
[426:53.50]That's, you're in world one.
[427:05.29]I can't believe you kept going.
[427:08.25]Well, sometimes you just have to go.
[427:10.59]You know what I mean?
[427:16.68]He quit streaming six times.
[427:20.32]Don't feel pressured to play it tomorrow.
[427:21.88]You can always take a break and return another time.
[427:23.80]I know, I know.
[427:24.50]But 95% of the stuff I was saying was bullshit anyways.
[427:27.30]You know that.
[427:29.38]Alright, let's go back.
[427:32.20]To... Let me make sure here.
[427:41.47]We are going to do the couple hours that we played that Minecraft event.
[427:48.94]I do want to go over some of them, at least the ones that I didn't get to catch.
[427:59.74]So these are from the Minecraft stream.
[428:10.51]So, from yesterday, we had 500 bits from Trident Jacks.
[428:13.85]Thank you, Trident Jacks.
[428:14.91]I said, what the fuck, Jerma?
[428:17.56]Sad Vega 250 yesterday.
[428:20.55]I greatly enjoyed this.
[428:21.51]You kind of went a little mad with power here, though.
[428:23.71]Yeah, if you didn't catch the beginning of the stream, that, what we did yesterday, was a glorified stress test beta test.
[428:33.82]None of the systems were in place.
[428:35.38]The Twitch integration wasn't in place.
[428:37.52]The server had some issues.
[428:40.60]And there was no permadeath.
[428:45.20]We just were like, you know what?
[428:46.64]Let's just go and just have collect data.
[428:51.23]Because even if you do a stress test, when potentially thousands of people are trying to do the same thing at the same time, there's a lot of things that you need to collect in regards to how that's even going to work.
[429:06.02]The next time we do that, it's going to be put in the oven for a little longer.
[429:12.54]So it will be more of the game that we were going to play rather than the streams an hour late.
[429:20.73]Let's just dump on a bunch of people with no whitelisting.
[429:27.77]In the future, the guards aren't going to be that powerful.
[429:30.83]They're not going to be able to teleport.
[429:32.89]It was really just to keep the peace for a stress test, essentially.
[429:41.34]They collected our data.
[429:42.96]No, no, no, no.
[429:43.54]I'm saying like for the server to be hit that hard.
[429:52.47]Keep the peace.
[429:54.19]Right.
[429:55.91]So thanks for helping us do that.
[429:58.73]Because the next time we do it, it'll be a lot more fleshed out.
[430:07.22]Thank you Nat for the 500 bits.
[430:09.97]Preacher's Rule gave five community subs yesterday as well.
[430:14.22]Siku gave $10 yesterday, 10,000 bits.
[430:16.58]They said it's 4 a.m.
[430:18.68]I've been up for a good 24 hours.
[430:20.42]Good morning.
[430:20.90]Apparently I get to catch the stream start for once.
[430:24.16]Damn.
[430:29.95]Yeah, none of the guards were in creative mode.
[430:32.67]They could just move around and...
[430:36.16]When the game is actually played, and there's actual permadeath involved, and there's actual stamina system is actually working correctly and everything, there will be things in place to make it so it's not just messy the first, like, hour that you play the game.
[430:55.74]Yeah, the devs were in creative, not the guards, right?
[430:58.88]Yeah.
[431:05.28]Is my Minecraft mod going to be more or less disappointing than Star Citizen?
[431:09.26]Well, I'll give you a couple of quick, strong differences here.
[431:12.92]My Minecraft mod events did not cost $150 million.
[431:17.74]And I didn't start making them 10 years ago.
[431:23.35]So, there's that.
[431:27.17]Oh, sorry, $280 million, right.
[431:27.91]Okay.
[431:34.93]But thank you, Siku.
[431:35.83]What?
[431:36.75]Can we play Cube World instead?
[431:37.57]Cube World.
[431:37.91]That's not cool.
[431:56.52]siku again thanks to the 500 bets buy a five dollar mic for an upgrade that will be fixed next time as well we were trying a different streaming setup so we could show different perspectives with cameras but there's probably just going to be two streams next time and I'm just going to squad with the other streaming account that's filming stuff so there'll be a squad stream of all the stuff going on but it'll be on a separate stream
[432:21.35]So then you can get, like, my actual full perspective if you don't ever want to see anything else.
[432:27.52]I'm guessing you were talking through Discord.
[432:29.84]Yeah, we've been... I had, like, a line into my ear where they could tell me things that were, you know, problems that were happening or whatever.
[432:40.21]Will that work for Avad?
[432:42.41]Um, you would just have to go to both channels and just queue them up at the same time and just play them at the same time.
[432:51.07]Because that seems like the best way to make it so I can actually just show my perspective always.
[433:04.89]Turn off channel points.
[433:05.79]They're garbage.
[433:06.63]This is not the Jeremy I love.
[433:09.77]I didn't even know they were on until they turned on into beta like six hours ago.
[433:18.41]I don't... I didn't even know I had him.
[433:21.41]I didn't even know I had him.
[433:24.76]I'm just gonna change him to be... It's gonna be like 50,000 points.
[433:31.50]To... Get me to do something.
[433:33.82]I don't know.
[433:38.05]I'm gonna up the value.
[433:38.93]I'm gonna up the values and add, like, three things.
[433:41.57]Like, you know, oh, you can use, like, the emote.
[433:43.03]I think that's interesting.
[433:44.15]Use emotes for a while.
[433:45.89]You can unlock an emote.
[433:47.16]Also, for 500 million channel points, like the old Pepsi commercials, you get a jet.
[434:02.94]Remember that?
[434:06.02]For 500 million Jerma channel points.
[434:09.41]And then the thing flies down and lands.
[434:11.19]And it's like, you could be an owner of a jet.
[434:18.82]didn't and somebody here's the funny thing somebody actually that was like a joke that Pepsi did and I think it was so out of reach that no one was ever going to be able to do it somebody did it and they didn't know what to do because they didn't have a jet right am I remembering this correctly yeah they got sued and they got a monetary prize instead yep that's so funny
[434:46.71]Some dude ended up with 10,000 Pepsi... 10 million Pepsi points, whatever.
[434:53.02]How would you get that many?
[434:58.56]They got sued over it.
[435:07.44]But, no, I'll have something stupid.
[435:09.38]Maybe... Maybe you can redeem, like, 10,000 channel points and I'll, like, turn my facecam on and, like, give you a wink.
[435:16.32]Although that would probably get kind of annoying.
[435:18.62]It would have to be high enough where it would not ruin every stream.
[435:23.35]So it would only happen, like, once in a while.
[435:24.87]But anyways...
[435:33.39]Once we actually get it off the ground, I at least want to do... I want to do one or two of them, at least, with all the rules in place and all the stuff in place.
[436:03.42]Last night is not an indicator of how those streams are going to go.
[436:11.63]So, just, you know, be aware of that.
[436:15.79]PeacefulHaley, thanks for the $2.50.
[436:16.87]Hey, Jerma, so glad you were doing a Minecraft stream.
[436:18.83]It was a ton of fun the two times I got in.
[436:21.53]But I can't wait till we get Twitch authorization in so we can have organized fun.
[436:25.20]But this was still awesome.
[436:26.58]Happy I got to play in the server with you and chat.
[436:28.16]Have a good night.
[436:30.74]Yeah, because there was, like you said, there was no whitelist.
[436:34.64]Anyone with Minecraft could just join that server.
[436:38.57]We had two, there's like three, four servers.
[436:43.63]Yeah, we just, we got this kinks to work out, and I knew that was going to happen.
[436:50.76]Should be fun once we get it truly off the ground, though.
[436:54.37]Oh, also important.
[436:56.91]Over the next couple of days, because we're getting to the end of the year here.
[437:04.17]There's going to be... I feel like once every two or three weeks, there's another channel that gets opened up into the Discord.
[437:12.31]I have more channels in my Discord than I think most people do.
[437:15.37]I just open up new channels every fucking week.
[437:18.95]There will be a new channel in the Discord to discuss nominations for the end of the year.
[437:25.51]For the New Year's Eve stream.
[437:28.23]I want to get that ball rolling.
[437:32.92]Because I want to be able to get the nomination videos ready and not scramble to get them done in three days like last year.
[437:43.70]So, expect some nomination discussions.
[437:47.21]I'm going to put a pinned message in there to make sure that people know the nominations and you can discuss them and nominate stuff.
[438:05.20]That stream feels like it was yesterday.
[438:07.00]Yeah.
[438:08.94]That was almost one full year ago.
[438:11.04]365 days ago.
[438:23.44]Do your best to ignore the pin.
[438:29.73]The passage of time.
[438:31.65]Yeah.
[438:33.67]But, uh, Vilemi gave 5,000 bits $50 yesterday.
[438:38.14]I want to make sure I talk about it because that's a lot of money to give and have not be addressed.
[438:42.50]They said, chat, now is the time to rise up.
[438:45.38]Viva la revolution.
[438:47.68]I may have even caught it, but I don't think I did.
[438:49.54]And I want to make sure I did.
[438:50.96]I was kind of locked in.
[438:55.85]Thank you, Vilemi.
[438:59.15]SadVega, thanks for the 250.
[439:00.19]I can't believe what a vile and wretched king you became so quickly.
[439:03.19]Mad with power, telling people to die simply for voicing their opinions about bread and a king's age.
[439:11.66]Your kingdom starves and you cackle with glee.
[439:19.15]Uh... Did I, though?
[439:22.85]Did I cackle?
[439:26.71]Alright, this is not even... This is really fucking funny, this one.
[439:37.00]This is not at the bit threshold, but I'm going to read it because this is actually really funny.
[439:43.50]Um... It's just funny.
[439:45.90]This is funny.
[439:48.14]Ultralaven said, I managed to throw an egg at you and land it three times.
[439:53.64]The first time, it almost crashed the server.
[439:57.10]I got really worried.
[440:03.25]Throwing an egg and going, oh shit, did I do that?
[440:08.77]It did crash the server.
[440:10.45]Oh yeah, because there were chickens that were spawned everywhere, right?
[440:15.82]Yeah, it spawned five chickens and the server went down.
[440:19.44]That's right.
[440:26.52]I'm surprised at what you guys could accomplish and like... Alright.
[440:29.90]Let's be real here.
[440:32.45]The amount of stuff that you guys did... I didn't even know what was going on outside the community.
[440:38.51]We were like killing people and I was trying not to die and we were walking around.
[440:42.63]I was putting people in fighting pits and shit and we walk around the community and there's like a whole...
[440:49.36]There's like farms that were done.
[440:52.16]There was a secret town.
[440:53.20]I was just running around like an idiot.
[441:03.80]Make a more static secondary server.
[441:07.08]Yeah, I... I'm trying to toy with the idea that if this goes well for a couple times, we just have fun for a few... Like the event.
[441:15.57]The event.
[441:16.75]The event.
[441:19.50]of permadeath and fighting and taking on each other and having stuff happen and if you die you're out and come fuck the king right it might actually be kind of fun just to have I can I'm not going to guarantee to have something like this permanently right
[441:43.08]But, like, to have a secondary server that's not as big, that's just a for fun server.
[441:55.12]It'd maybe like to have it up for, like, a few months.
[441:59.28]And just have people go in and play and do whatever they want and just put some interesting rules on it.
[442:03.69]And then we could go in and, you know, take a look at it every now and then.
[442:10.39]But I don't know.
[442:11.79]Last time I did that, I had a TF2 server for a while.
[442:14.23]And I just couldn't manage it.
[442:17.11]And I would have to bring on people to manage it and keep them around.
[442:20.61]And they'd have to be the ones managing everything.
[442:26.12]They would have to be people that were on call to run that server.
[442:29.40]And I don't know if I am ready to make that commitment right now.
[442:38.87]there's a bunch of other stuff that I currently want to do and I wouldn't be able to keep up with it really at all just make your mods do it no I what why would I do that hey alright now you guys now have to manage a Minecraft server thanks bye the mods are people man they got stuff going on they got to do they live lives
[443:08.08]Why would I want to tell them to do that?
[443:23.99]Volunteers?
[443:24.75]Yeah, anybody that volunteers time to help run a community.
[443:33.48]I'm not gonna be like, oh, hey, thanks.
[443:35.22]Oh, by the way, you're doing this stuff.
[443:37.76]Do this now, too.
[443:39.12]And for free, as well.
[443:40.09]Do that for free.
[443:42.69]Manage my entire Minecraft community every day.
[443:47.85]No.
[443:48.71]I'm not gonna do that.
[443:58.10]They're saying there's volunteers for the Minecraft server.
[444:01.78]Yeah, I mean, maybe some of you guys were into it and interested, but that would be a process to pick that, you know?
[444:07.94]I wouldn't want just to be like... It would have to... Maybe we'll go and get into that another time.
[444:17.87]But, let's keep going.
[444:20.15]Almost done with yesterday, and then we'll go through the next day quick, because it's getting late.
[444:25.96]1,500 bits from throwaway girl.
[444:27.52]Thank you.
[444:28.94]Thank you, throwaway girl.
[444:29.72]Appreciate it.
[444:30.12]They say, hey, you've been a big help to me as I'm about to begin my transition.
[444:34.76]I haven't told my family yet.
[444:36.02]Not all of them.
[444:37.12]Whenever I get nervous or anxious, I always have your streams to watch.
[444:39.70]Thanks so much for being a real funny dude.
[444:43.33]Good luck.
[444:51.09]Be the best person you know how to be.
[444:52.99]I've said that before and I'll say it again.
[444:57.02]It's as simple as that.
[445:06.16]Thank you so much for the 1500 bits.
[445:08.14]I wish you luck.
[445:09.92]Take care.
[445:16.36]Damn, I just woke up.
[445:17.06]It's VOD time.
[445:21.54]It is VOD time.
[445:24.06]How many VODs were there, by the way?
[445:29.73]Oh, is the VOD muted?
[445:33.53]Are there 12?
[445:34.27]12?
[445:34.65]There's 11 VODs?
[445:36.31]No, there's not.
[445:37.15]Are there really 11 VODs?
[445:39.07]What have I done?
[445:39.95]Why did I do that?
[445:40.57]Oh, no.
[445:46.05]Is it 1?
[445:46.48]Okay, this is 1.
[445:58.70]You just scared the shit out of me.
[446:00.03]I knew what was happening too.
[446:04.71]Soundwaves Park, thanks for the thousand bits.
[446:07.04]Jeremiah, I've been having an awful day and hearing you acknowledge the Garfield coffee pasta, which I started, made it a lot better.
[446:12.50]Thank you, Boomer King.
[446:14.66]Hope your day got better, I really do.
[446:16.69]Thanks for participating.
[446:19.07]If you're a viewer or you were a participator in the events last night, thanks for watching, thanks for being a part of it.
[446:25.21]And thank you, Garfield, for being the worst comic book character that has ever existed.
[446:31.74]Two scoops, thanks for the 500 bits.
[446:32.76]510.
[446:32.78]Hey, Jerm, I had a lot of fun tonight, even if it was a mess all the way through.
[446:36.74]Sad I didn't get to fight John Comcast.
[446:38.56]I really wish you did.
[446:40.27]Actually, you did, but I think that he killed you instantly.
[446:43.65]Right?
[446:44.21]Oh, yeah.
[446:44.91]Yeah, you did fight.
[446:45.75]You died instantly, right?
[446:48.77]John Comcast hit somebody once and they died immediately, because I think they were like three.
[446:57.06]what happened I remember oh that was Joan that was jonah's bonus right yeah they were two years old they had three health yeah they died in one hit that's so funny and we were walking around in like enchanted diamond armor that's how yesterday was not an indicator of how that game is going to go
[447:23.27]Stress testing.
[447:24.54]Data collection.
[447:26.50]Things breaking, things being fixed.
[447:30.56]Oh yeah, yeah.
[447:31.20]I had like 40 hearts.
[447:33.12]And I still died from a stone sword.
[447:34.68]How?
[447:35.00]Oh yeah, I took all my clothes off and went swimming.
[447:36.56]I forgot.
[447:40.06]But thank you, TwoScoops.
[447:42.20]They say, honestly, I was really just trying to become your queen instead.
[447:45.03]Why won't you love me?
[447:46.03]Also, have you thought about doing creative multiplayer builds similar to RTs?
[447:53.53]Um, probably not.
[447:56.39]Minecraft to me is... I don't think I would want to just kind of play Minecraft and build stuff in Minecraft.
[448:07.12]I mean, it could be fun.
[448:08.02]Look, if I'm going to have a server that can hold more than 200 people at the same time,
[448:15.04]Maybe it'll be fun before I get rid of this server to just get a bunch of people on and build a dirt deck.
[448:20.84]Like the biggest dirt deck that anyone's ever built in Minecraft.
[448:23.10]I don't know.
[448:25.56]Because, I mean, the server is fairly expensive.
[448:29.46]So, I'd like to use it.
[448:31.24]We'll see.
[448:41.31]Thank you for the $5.
[448:43.13]Two scoops, appreciate it.
[448:43.93]Thanks for participating.
[448:46.31]Dark Soul, thanks for the $2.50.
[448:48.33]Now, a story.
[448:49.81]I made a Cube World joke during the jackass PS2 stream.
[448:53.86]I was a newer viewer of only a few months, but realized later you had a Cube World video.
[449:00.12]I do?
[449:03.67]I have a Cube World video?
[449:05.17]No, I don't.
[449:13.35]What the fuck is this?
[449:14.53]I have a cube world video.
[449:18.41]I've never played this before.
[449:19.41]I don't remember any of this.
[449:20.67]Zero.
[449:23.39]It's a grandpa video?
[449:28.62]I get it.
[449:33.76]What?
[449:33.92]Well, you have to put it on the pot for two hours.
[449:41.84]Yeah, but what's the temperature?
[449:43.04]It sits in the pot for two hours.
[449:44.58]You have to cook it for two hours, otherwise it's not going to work.
[449:46.84]I get it.
[449:47.08]What temperature does it have to be set?
[449:51.08]We're going to watch this video on stream.
[449:54.06]I know everyone's tired and wants to go to bed, but we're watching this video on stream right now.
[450:01.65]I have no idea what this video is.
[450:14.62]Let's run.
[450:31.73]Can you see it?
[450:33.49]What's this doing?
[450:39.27]No, no fucking ads.
[450:40.97]Get out of here.
[450:41.61]Alright, there we go.
[450:53.17]Let's see.
[450:54.91]Well, you have to put it in the pot for two hours.
[451:03.74]Yeah, but what's the temperature?
[451:04.96]It sits in the pot for two hours.
[451:06.48]You have to cook it for two hours, otherwise it's not going to work.
[451:08.74]I get it.
[451:08.98]What temperature does it have to be set at?
[451:10.48]It's a fucking pot roast.
[451:11.60]You can't screw it up.
[451:12.60]Get out.
[451:13.34]I'm doing a video.
[451:14.80]What's the... You need to tell me... Get out!
[451:16.32]Oh, Jesus.
[451:17.70]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[451:19.84]It's Grandpa here.
[451:21.70]And today, I've got a special fucking video for you because I got access to Cube World.
[451:29.81]Okay, so this is Jerma's file.
[451:32.15]We can go ahead and fucking delete that.
[451:34.02]Start a new file for Grandpa's character.
[451:36.60]Let's get going there.
[451:37.52]Create.
[451:38.32]Click it, baby.
[451:39.14]Was that a guitar?
[451:41.40]I don't want to play the musician.
[451:43.20]What's this, a musician?
[451:44.76]We got ear musician.
[451:46.14]We got drunk guy.
[451:47.58]We got gremlin from Gremlins 2.
[451:49.11]It was a pretty good movie, but don't really want to play as a gremlin.
[451:53.19]We got the drunk goblin.
[451:54.81]I don't like the drunk goblin.
[451:56.01]The lizard, I like lizard people.
[451:58.15]Undead, I don't think I want to play.
[451:59.85]Fucking frog people.
[452:01.09]I'm playing as a fucking frog man.
[452:03.33]I'm not even going to go any further on the characters.
[452:06.72]So what you do in Minecraft is, it's pretty simple.
[452:09.63]You go around and you collect resources and you fight monsters.
[452:13.77]What the hell is it?
[452:14.37]What the fuck is this?
[452:15.45]What is going on here?
[452:16.37]What is this, the Ninja Turtles?
[452:18.61]What the fuck are the Ninja Turtles doing in this game?
[452:21.15]Look, it's Leonardo, that's Donatello behind him.
[452:23.77]Oh, what am I?
[452:24.85]Get the, ow!
[452:27.21]What do you do in this game?
[452:29.69]I don't, I have no, what am I supposed to even be doing?
[452:33.83]Does anybody know what you do in this game?
[452:37.28]I have not figured out... All I've done is... Was that a bee?
[452:40.02]It's a fucking bee!
[452:41.62]Come on, you bee judge.
[452:42.22]Still true.
[452:42.92]You see, the real awesome part about this game is the fact that I'm battling right now as a frog.
[452:49.15]There's never been a game in existence where you could fight people as frogs.
[452:52.93]It just never existed, and that's why I like it.
[452:56.75]And that's it.
[452:57.17]I have five experience points right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[452:59.53]I just figured out how to play Cube World.
[453:03.30]I'm concerned about the people that made this game, because they're going to get fucking sued.
[453:07.75]First it's the Ninja Turtles, and then look, it's the Seven Dwarfs.
[453:10.99]Disney is going to have a field day with these guys.
[453:13.73]Look, that's Snuffy, that's Gruffy, that's Poopy and Snoopy.
[453:16.91]See, that's the Seven Dwarfs.
[453:19.13]How are they not going to get sued by this?
[453:20.95]That's funny.
[453:22.03]I really am concerned.
[453:23.51]Let me go get a closer look here.
[453:25.45]Alright, Fluffy, you need to go back to Disney World, because I said so.
[453:30.24]What?! !
[453:34.18]What the... Actually, that was actually pretty surprising.
[453:37.95]The seven dwarves didn't have those fucking powers.
[453:42.63]Oh, would you look who it is, everybody.
[453:45.23]It's Donatello, by himself, without his boys.
[453:49.00]Hey, Donnie, how are you?
[453:50.32]How are the rest of the Ninja Turtles?
[453:52.24]Yeah, without them you aren't so fucking tough, now are you?
[453:55.34]Got something to say?
[453:57.48]I have my own house.
[454:00.59]Uh, Donatello, I think you might have a brain injury.
[454:05.96]Somebody help me!
[454:06.76]Somebody please help me!
[454:07.80]I got a bunch of animals following me!
[454:09.74]I got, like, two animal bug birds!
[454:12.28]Ah, what, what are they, what are you doing?
[454:15.22]The same thing happened three times in a row.
[454:17.45]I must have just run out of shit to do, because there was, what do you even do in Cube World?
[454:25.53]I think I committed to make a Cube World video, and then I was like, fuck, um, you just run away from enemies.
[454:34.56]Okay?
[454:35.00]Joey, what are you doing?
[454:36.13]Leave him alone!
[454:37.11]What did he do?
[454:38.48]What?
[454:39.14]What am I talking about?
[454:39.90]What am I talking about?
[454:40.90]Oh yeah, fuck that dude.
[455:08.37]Okay, I kind of feel bad about what just happened.
[455:13.63]How did I end up in a tree?
[455:15.77]What?
[455:17.36]Hello, Mr. Peacock.
[455:18.42]How are you?
[455:19.04]How are you doing today?
[455:19.96]Yes, I smell good.
[455:21.16]Thank you.
[455:21.90]Um, got some trouble here.
[455:23.48]Oh my god.
[455:24.82]Kick his ass.
[455:26.26]Kick his fucking ass.
[455:27.42]Look at this animation.
[455:28.64]Look at this awesome animation.
[455:30.21]He's skiing at him.
[455:31.55]Look at this.
[455:32.35]Oh my goodness gracious.
[455:33.57]You are... Oh, he died.
[455:36.35]Now I'm sad.
[455:38.44]I keep killing birds in this game.
[455:40.68]I feel terrible.
[455:41.64]I'm a bird killer.
[455:43.50]Do I still got it?
[455:45.06]I keep killing birds in this game.
[455:47.44]I just, I feel awful about it.
[455:49.36]I feel absolutely fucking terrible about all this.
[455:52.09]It shouldn't be a thing.
[455:53.41]We should have a... Yeah, I still got it.
[455:55.29]This video is like, this video is seven years old, by the way.
[455:58.73]To be fair here, guys, he did do that on his own.
[456:01.85]I didn't ask him to.
[456:03.23]He just flipped the fuck out and started skiing at the guy.
[456:06.49]And you know what?
[456:07.21]That's what we shoot the clouds.
[456:09.74]I like this game.
[456:12.00]Some kind of encampment over here.
[456:14.04]Looks like there could be some food and some supplies.
[456:16.80]There is nothing special.
[456:17.98]Well, there is some stuff here.
[456:20.30]Is this yours?
[456:21.94]What if I just reupload this video?
[456:23.12]Every week.
[456:23.42]Every Saturday.
[456:28.80]Come on up here.
[456:29.38]You want to make some food and stuff?
[456:30.58]We could be friends.
[456:31.90]Do you think people would even remember this video was uploaded?
[456:33.93]No, okay.
[456:34.19]Don't want to be friends.
[456:35.47]You just dug your own grave.
[456:38.39]Because I don't remember this video being uploaded.
[456:44.15]I made this video.
[456:46.11]And I just was telling that person I never made a Cube World video.
[456:51.27]See you later.
[456:52.27]Get fucking rapid fired.
[456:55.17]That's how you do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[456:56.57]You take his money.
[456:58.09]And then you go back and take his food too.
[457:00.17]That pineapple is mine.
[457:03.25]You had your chance to be friendly.
[457:05.35]Just wanted to share.
[457:06.95]If you liked this video, press the button.
[457:08.93]This is gonna taste real good, baby.
[457:10.78]Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[457:13.92]That's it.
[457:15.26]The only good part about this video, I think, is this part here.
[457:18.48]The first minute, the pot roast part is pretty funny.
[457:22.70]Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[457:27.40]Look, alright, so... Give me a break, guys.
[457:31.38]Let me tell you a little bit of a YouTuber's secret, okay?
[457:34.69]Well, not even a secret, you all know this by now.
[457:38.25]I put at the end of the video, it was only at the end of the video, it was just like, hey, if you liked the video, then give me a like, right?
[457:44.37]I didn't ever set it.
[457:46.09]It was just in the very end.
[457:47.44]You could even have clicked off the video by then.
[457:49.52]People used to do, like, hide content behind likes.
[457:55.40]Do you remember that shit?
[457:58.15]I will upload part five if this video gets 50,000.
[458:02.17]Like, dude, shut up.
[458:04.80]What are you talking about?
[458:06.48]You made 10 of these already.
[458:09.36]They're already uploaded.
[458:10.57]They're already ready to go.
[458:11.39]You just have to hit public on them.
[458:14.47]Guys, I really don't know if you want to see more of my Minecraft gameplay here.
[458:21.15]I don't know.
[458:21.69]This is episode three.
[458:22.83]Let me know in the comments.
[458:23.96]By the way, I already have 15 of these done.
[458:28.56]And they're already uploaded.
[458:30.74]I'm going to upload them regardless of what happens in this video.
[458:37.77]Do people still do that?
[458:40.47]They don't still do that, do they?
[458:51.63]They do.
[458:56.46]I thought that enough time would have gone by.
[458:58.36]Are people still giving away Xboxes?
[459:03.14]But now you gotta ring a bell too.
[459:13.18]They give away iPhones now.
[459:17.24]I remember doing a giveaway before.
[459:19.46]I remember I gave away like a mouse.
[459:23.03]I wonder if this person is still around in the community.
[459:27.55]Cause I, I got a mouse and I remember giving it, it was like a razor.
[459:32.93]It was one of the razor mice.
[459:37.29]It had nothing to do.
[459:38.13]There was no like sponsorship.
[459:39.57]It was just like, I had this mouse and I was like, oh fuck.
[459:41.81]I got, I think I didn't want it or I didn't like it or something.
[459:50.45]I think maybe I bought... I had two of them.
[459:52.63]I don't remember what... It was like 10 years ago.
[459:54.75]But I mailed somebody a mouse.
[460:00.25]I wonder if that person's still around.
[460:02.47]I wonder if they still have that mouse.
[460:10.46]Do you ever miss the old early days?
[460:14.70]Yeah, sometimes.
[460:16.94]I mean, it's like a different mindset, though.
[460:21.37]Sometimes, you know, I miss, like, making these old little YouTube videos, you know, like the ones from, like, 2012.
[460:30.54]I think it was a lot simpler back then.
[460:38.18]In regards to, like, Grandpa's gonna just do a Cube World video, and I'm gonna get, like, chased around by monsters for two minutes.
[460:48.43]You know what I mean?
[460:48.97]It was just, like, kind of simple.
[460:57.49]But if we're talking like 2011, 2012, I mean, that's just the kind of videos people were making.
[461:02.97]It's videos I thought were fun and interesting.
[461:04.79]2014, 15, 16 is when I really started to try to make a bunch of shit that I really wanted to put time and effort into.
[461:16.98]And yeah, I do miss the... It's just, it's never going to come back, though.
[461:21.29]That's not going to happen anymore.
[461:23.50]Like, 2013 to, like, 2016, 2017, really, is like... I spent... I mean, I stream.
[461:33.09]Like, this stream's almost eight hours long, right?
[461:34.81]I streamed yesterday for a few hours.
[461:37.57]I mean, that typically would be longer than that, but... Because we were testing the server.
[461:42.23]But it's not like I'm spending less time or more time.
[461:47.71]Sometimes I would spend four, three, four, five days straight on a video.
[461:52.38]You know, I'm live three or four times a week.
[461:57.77]I don't know what like I average for hours a week on stream, like actually turned on.
[462:02.37]It's probably, I mean, if my average stream is six and a half to seven hours, six to seven hours, seven, like 14, 21, maybe like 20 to 25 to 35 hours a week on stream, like on broadcast.
[462:25.04]If I was going to make a YouTube video on a game, it would probably be like 30 hours in one session to do like one video.
[462:36.49]So that makes sense.
[462:40.03]Do I have an alternate path in case Twitch doesn't work out?
[462:44.51]Well, here's the thing about that question.
[462:45.89]Twitch already has worked out.
[462:48.11]A lot.
[462:50.55]So...
[462:54.44]It's not like, oh, I have plans when, I don't know, whenever this starts to, people start to lose interest.
[463:03.41]I have like little contingency plans of what I want to do.
[463:08.15]But I wouldn't look back and be like, oh man, this didn't work out.
[463:15.40]I'm doing something that I've wanted to do my whole life.
[463:19.02]I've already achieved my dreams of just doing stuff like this.
[463:27.33]So...
[463:29.20]I would never look back and be like, oh, damn.
[463:31.26]Like, let's say this over the next few years, let's say viewership drops or, you know, it's okay.
[463:36.12]Well, that's whatever, you know, I, I, I did everything I wanted to do in regards to like audience level and engagement with people.
[463:46.65]And, but I don't even, I don't even look at it like that.
[463:52.21]Seriously.
[463:52.57]Like I, whatever happens tomorrow, I have to see what happens tomorrow.
[463:57.46]or three weeks from now we'll see I don't know I'm just riding the wave and just doing it for fun and just trying to stay on the I'm just trying to stay on the surfboard and we'll see where where the water goes I have no idea you're the number one Jump King streamer on Twitch I don't think that's true
[464:24.92]I think a lot of big streamers have played Jump King.
[464:28.78]I think I'd be pretty far down on that list.
[464:31.72]So I don't know about that.
[464:36.50]Probably not even now, right?
[464:41.04]But it's always nice to reminisce, and I do forget some things.
[464:44.22]What is this?
[464:44.66]Jermis Sandler.
[464:46.27]Oh, can anybody... Before I... We have, like, bits to do, but... Can I get somebody to link me some fucked up clips from tonight so I can know what I said?
[464:55.81]That's Adam Sandler speak, okay?
[465:00.14]That one was weird.
[465:09.36]any other like any other anything let me let me just say this anything else I should know about I mean like anything else I should know about goblin and chicken noises chicken and teeth goblin nails what do you guys think I'm like I just get go grab a chicken in the woods and like go on all fours like yeah
[465:39.80]That's not that bad.
[465:55.26]That's alright.
[465:57.20]Actual meltdown, though.
[465:59.42]When you put actual meltdown in the title, you know it's gonna be bad.
[466:02.08]Forget this jump!
[466:06.65]Can I please just get this jump before I start to have a little bit of a problem?
[466:12.04]I'm gonna have a... Okay.
[466:13.82]Okay.
[466:14.44]Okay.
[466:15.14]Okay.
[466:20.88]Video games suck.
[466:22.14]Video games suck.
[466:23.32]Video games suck.
[466:24.46]Video games suck.
[466:25.75]All video games.
[466:26.63]None of them are fun.
[466:27.43]All of them suck.
[466:28.25]All video games suck.
[466:29.67]I'm never playing a video game ever again.
[466:41.63]Uh, we'll do one more.
[466:43.29]Jesus.
[466:46.05]In my brain, it's just somebody behind me playing a piano.
[466:49.27]I'm just... Crusted the cloud?
[466:58.65]There's a lot of these.
[467:00.72]How many things did I do?
[467:01.76]Oh my god, I had it!
[467:02.42]I had it!
[467:03.62]Oh my god, I had it!
[467:04.28]I had it!
[467:14.88]No.
[467:18.61]No.
[467:19.43]Ladies and gentlemen, via satellite, let's see how he's doing.
[467:22.67]To discuss all politics.
[467:26.77]Larry Stevenson.
[467:36.30]Okay, alright.
[467:39.30]I don't want to see you anymore.
[467:40.82]I don't need to see you anymore.
[467:41.80]I don't need to see you anymore.
[467:43.94]I don't need to see anymore.
[467:44.96]The Toronto and Beckham filmmakers.
[468:00.47]Okay.
[468:00.83]Alright.
[468:01.67]I just need to make sure there was an, I need to make sure that I needed to, you know, be aware of them.
[468:07.91]Okay.
[468:08.25]Let's, let's do the bits, right?
[468:10.68]How does that sound?
[468:12.74]Oh, it's late.
[468:18.35]Finally!
[468:18.89]Oh no, Dark Soul!
[468:23.05]250 from Dark Soul.
[468:24.93]Thank you, Dark Soul.
[468:27.26]It's a cube world.
[468:28.38]Okay, you had a cube world video.
[468:31.98]Years ago, a friend told me this guy's hilarious and proceeded to show me only Grandpa Plays videos.
[468:37.46]So it turns out I did see your content years prior and thought you were a psycho who just pretended to be an old man in all your videos.
[468:44.93]Keep up the great work and keep the peasant children off the grass.
[468:50.03]Like, that's just what I did every video?
[468:51.87]Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[468:57.98]I had fun playing for five minutes until you died in the lake.
[469:00.46]For real, though, the best part of this stream, in my opinion, was seeing what the community built.
[469:03.76]I would love a community server that you visit every month or so.
[469:06.10]That's... maybe.
[469:07.96]We'll see.
[469:09.35]Maybe.
[469:10.03]Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
[469:11.53]I don't know.
[469:11.89]Maybe.
[469:12.99]Hold on to that idea.
[469:13.89]Sigmatic, thanks for the thousand bits.
[469:24.47]I'm gonna say a line and I want you to determine which stream it was from.
[469:28.79]If it was from today or from yesterday.
[469:33.50]This was the worst stream since the surge.
[469:39.24]Which day are they talking about here?
[469:40.54]Are they talking about today or yesterday?
[469:46.53]uh with some tweaking of the guards and fixing hardcore this would be sick as hell yes I know no stream is as bad as the surge was the surge is it was that was one of the worst just that really was the worst stream I probably ever did I don't remember it that's because it was so awful that you you just refused to acknowledge it existed
[470:18.27]the surge wasn't funny even in like a pity way no I know it was horrible it was awful it was evil within two is close to they were just awful just awful awful just I was in bad mood and by like I hated the games it was just really was not good I remember the evil within two I hated the game I was I hated that game and I was just like was it a bad I was in one of those moods and that is a bad mood
[470:47.10]Well, I remember it.
[470:51.58]Ugh.
[470:56.97]Surge?
[470:57.63]What is this?
[470:59.01]How do you have this ready?
[471:01.01]This game doesn't suck.
[471:01.89]I'm sorry for saying that.
[471:03.01]If you're like a developer and you're watching this game... Try fucking harder next time!
[471:19.38]Jesus Christ oh my god that's like so bad I'm sorry I'm like retroactively sorry I'm sorry that was I told you that was a bad stream that's the worst stream I've ever done that was from the search
[471:50.36]God damn it.
[471:52.28]I gotta... Okay, let's... Yeah, but thank you, Sigmatic, for the thousand bits.
[472:00.11]I appreciate it.
[472:02.41]Do The Surge 2.
[472:04.51]That title of that stream would be the... It's obvious it was meant as a joke.
[472:09.37]Yeah, I know, but I didn't know.
[472:13.57]If I play The Surge 2, the title of that stream will just be titled The Second Worst Dream I've Ever Done.
[472:24.54]What if I love the Surge 2?
[472:25.76]What if it's so good?
[472:27.44]What if I love it?
[472:28.92]Like, love it.
[472:30.98]It's possible.
[472:31.52]Alright.
[472:33.20]Let's fire through these.
[472:37.87]What's with the spam?
[472:39.87]Spamming.
[472:40.53]Derm is mad.
[472:41.19]Good job, Nicholas.
[472:43.45]Good job, Nicholas.
[472:45.33]Good luck in the first grade next week.
[472:49.28]God damn it, man.
[473:03.67]That stream was scary.
[473:07.53]Alright, but listen to me.
[473:08.99]This is important.
[473:09.89]We're going to go over this real quick.
[473:12.27]Does anyone know how many times I've broadcasted?
[473:15.87]Like how many times has the stream turned on?
[473:17.49]Does anybody know?
[473:23.31]It's been hundreds and hundreds of times.
[473:29.59]Like 700? 857?
[473:35.81]Alright, so if in 850 broadcasts... Alright, so I said the Surge sucked, and I told a first grader that I didn't like them or something.
[473:47.21]I mean, that's two instances of almost 900 streams.
[473:53.77]Right?
[473:54.49]That's not bad.
[473:55.15]That's not a bad ratio of being annoyed.
[474:03.18]I bullied Fortnite Jimmy.
[474:04.98]No, I was, I was bullied by Fortnite Jimmy.
[474:08.66]Don't get that twisted.
[474:09.78]Alright, let's do the bits.
[474:16.76]Bits, bits, bits, bits, bits, bits, bits, bits, bits.
[474:20.83]Yes is online.
[474:23.05]$50 from Yes is online.
[474:24.29]5,000 bits.
[474:24.49]Good job getting past chapter one.
[474:26.43]Thank you for the $50.
[474:27.17]I think we caught it.
[474:28.81]Thank you.
[474:33.56]That stream was... I fished, right?
[474:36.83]This is all coming back to me.
[474:39.21]I think I have a distinct memory of looking over a chat and people were just spamming, please do something else.
[474:47.75]Everyone was spamming it and I just didn't even listen to them.
[474:49.90]I just kept fishing.
[474:51.72]Right?
[474:52.20]I remember that.
[474:58.46]I actually really liked that stream.
[475:00.12]That was like a lot of fun for me.
[475:05.34]That was Nancy Drew.
[475:08.32]I think there's a lot of Nancy Drew supporters in this community.
[475:22.69]I mean, yeah, Nancy Drew, right?
[475:24.35]I'm telling you.
[475:24.99]Alright, let's keep going.
[475:27.46]Yes also gave $2.50.
[475:28.94]He'll get my name right one day.
[475:32.38]Yes?
[475:33.60]Yes is online.
[475:34.86]Is that correct?
[475:35.60]I think I got it.
[475:37.64]We had a shitload of community subs today.
[475:39.42]Some from AtmaStarfish5, AdventureMFDan5, Fitty3, a three drop.
[475:46.13]Fitty gave $5 as well right after that.
[475:47.71]Remember the Jess Farman channel points and emos?
[475:49.65]Ignore that, please.
[475:51.87]That's right.
[475:53.11]I ignored it.
[475:54.05]But I didn't, because you gave a lot of money.
[475:55.53]Thank you.
[475:56.91]Thank you, Zake, for the 250.
[475:57.77]They linked an image of a guy screaming and crying behind a smiling face.
[476:05.65]I think this is supposed to be me today.
[476:09.29]Is that me?
[476:09.75]I don't understand.
[476:11.97]What is that?
[476:12.91]That's me hiding behind like a smile.
[476:19.41]Well, I don't think so.
[476:23.83]uh desoid j captcha thanks for the thousand bits ten dollars are you finished with that book yet never finished it never even really started it I got like 10 pages in or something and it was like nah the same for me I'm not smart enough to do this

[476:47.57]Morkus Borkus, five.
[476:49.35]Desoid Kajadfa, five community subs.
[476:53.29]Thank you, all of you.
[476:55.91]Davey Davey gave some subs, too.
[476:57.71]Thank you for those community subs, Davey.
[477:01.12]That's the thing, though.
[477:01.68]Who watches you for the game?
[477:02.62]The game doesn't matter.
[477:04.64]It's you that makes it worth it.
[477:05.74]You're hilarious, and you make trash games funny.
[477:08.16]That's why there are Nancy Drew supporters.
[477:12.92]That's a really, thank you.
[477:14.30]That's a really nice thing to say.
[477:17.23]Yeah.
[477:18.15]I just, I hope you have fun.
[477:20.21]Regardless of what game is being played or what we're doing, I hope that you take at least some form of entertainment away from it.
[477:27.57]Whatever that is, right?
[477:31.62]Bible, thanks for the five subs.
[477:34.46]Nondescript civilian gave a bunch of subs to his 10 here.
[477:39.74]Lot of community subs tonight.
[477:40.84]Flugboy gave 250.
[477:43.10]Jerm, I hope you're doing well.
[477:43.92]Hope I get to make it into the next Fuck the King stream.
[477:47.84]Was wondering, are you aware of your meme that has suddenly blown up?
[477:50.60]It sounds similar to the defiant frenemy strider.
[477:55.85]I know, yes.
[477:56.63]I've been made aware of the giant enemy spider.
[478:00.99]And then...
[478:09.47]I know it.
[478:22.30]That's a pog moment.
[478:23.37]No way, he's the spider guy?
[478:25.13]That's right!
[478:50.62]Why did I just pretend to do that?
[478:52.65]That was weird.
[478:53.07]Hey, Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the 250 bits.
[478:57.75]Appreciate it.
[478:58.97]This is a... Ah, Molding Memories.
[479:03.96]Oh my god, please, Bob!
[479:04.82]I'm losing it.
[479:12.77]Jump King, I was way more, I was a way, Jump King was like times 10 of just absolutely all over the place, like psycho.
[479:30.35]It was like times 50.
[479:41.92]We're getting close to hit and run.
[479:44.10]Yep.
[479:47.97]At its very peak, we're probably seven out of hit and run.
[479:52.99]I'm not sure I'll ever get there ever again, though.
[479:56.21]You gotta remember, guys, hit and run was like 13 hours long.
[480:00.35]At hour number 12, if you're a 10 out of 10, 10 out of Simpsons, Simpsons out of Simpsons, it was like hour number 13.
[480:11.85]I was out of control.
[480:16.99]This stream was like... I played for like seven hours, which is still a lot for like a hard, kind of focused, crazy game like that.
[480:27.16]You were in such pain towards the end.
[480:28.88]I felt bad by proxy.
[480:30.34]Yeah, I know.
[480:31.96]I will never get there again, I don't think.
[480:34.84]It'd be hard to get there again.
[480:43.03]Adorable Cockroach, thanks for the thousand bits.
[480:44.91]Channel points are forever.
[480:48.29]Thanks for the ten bucks, Cockroach.
[480:52.65]And I'll figure out something fun to do with channel points.
[480:55.93]I'll tweak some of the numbers.
[480:59.11]Uh, pif flavor, thanks for the 500 bits.
[481:02.97]Dermasura, you okay?
[481:04.01]Your mental health is slipping.
[481:05.13]Also, pronounce my name right or I will lose it.
[481:07.97]It's pronounced pie flavor, not pee flavor.
[481:10.27]Well, I said it wrong.
[481:11.51]I didn't say it either one of those ways.
[481:13.22]Like you have said, you see it's pie, like the math number, but maybe you just don't know what that is.
[481:28.93]Oh.
[481:30.13]Do I?
[481:36.89]It's hard to get it to the 40th decimal, but I can do it.
[481:46.78]I did call you P-Flavor.
[481:47.76]I just called you Piff-Flavor, so it's Pie-Flavor.
[481:49.90]Got it.
[481:50.60]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[481:51.24]Appreciate it.
[481:57.59]Basic feral thanks for the 900 bits.
[481:59.27]30 out of 30 Jerm is snort.
[482:03.33]What is the... Oh, the title of the stream is wicked fucked up, isn't it?
[482:09.43]What is this title right now?
[482:11.33]Time's upset today.
[482:12.97]50 out of 40 with 2 in brackets.
[482:15.42]Stream turns off at 30.
[482:23.82]Okay, well that didn't happen.
[482:28.47]We had some type of system we were counting.
[482:34.21]Thank you, Basic Ferrell, for the nearly $10 in bits.
[482:36.49]Appreciate that.
[482:37.49]Abomination Zero, thanks for $2.50.
[482:38.91]We'd love a good meltdown stream.
[482:43.73]I... It was close.
[482:46.51]It was... This was like Mario Maker level of losing my mind, right?
[482:54.28]Yeah, this is Mario Maker 2... Yeah.
[482:58.55]This is not Simpsons 7 run.
[483:03.89]There's more than that?
[483:04.57]A little more?
[483:05.47]Mario Maker was less than that.
[483:06.81]Mario Maker... Okay.
[483:15.12]Maybe.
[483:16.88]You did say you hated all video games.
[483:20.82]Yeah, but we say things when we're angry that we don't mean, you know?
[483:24.42]We say things when we're angry.
[483:26.22]We're like, I don't mean that.
[483:27.54]I don't even know what that means.
[483:31.93]It's called opening up all your windows and just venting out the toxic air surrounding your body.
[483:48.25]Yelling out the window.
[483:49.45]I'm not yelling out the window.
[483:57.06]Using my points for something fun before you fuck them up.
[483:59.32]Balls, balls, balls.
[484:03.54]That's pretty good.
[484:04.72]Pretty good use.
[484:10.30]thank you abomination zero thank you uh ff12 pen elo for the 250 bits here some coke brand coke gaming coke because you're epic no sorry it's because you're epic here have some of this because you're epic
[484:31.89]Lord Repta, thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[484:34.47]$15 in bits from Lord Repta.
[484:37.55]They just say, love you, Jerm Jerm.
[484:38.71]Thank you.
[484:40.09]Thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[484:45.84]I really hope that that never happens to me.
[484:49.22]Because if this stream ever gets, like, 100 community subs from Coke Gaming, I'm just gonna, like, talk a bunch of shit and laugh at them and stuff.
[484:57.72]And, like, I'm not even thinking it's real.
[485:02.54]That's not good, right?
[485:03.50]I hope that never happens to me.
[485:07.28]Is that shit set up?
[485:08.35]Do we know?
[485:08.89]Anybody know?
[485:09.37]Is that shit just like set up?
[485:10.41]Or is that just like an ad?
[485:12.99]Was that an ad?
[485:13.47]Did I get added?
[485:14.49]I think I might have been... I think I got baited by the ad.
[485:16.85]Is that really happening?
[485:22.68]Is Coke Gaming giving community subs to people?
[485:26.38]Like Subway was?
[485:28.72]I don't know.
[485:30.29]You have to be partnered.
[485:32.31]Oh, you have to get partnered.
[485:34.93]Oh.
[485:37.60]So it's like a Coke Gaming partners you on Twitch sort of thing.
[485:45.40]Oh, I see.
[485:45.98]Okay.
[485:46.72]I don't know why, but I thought it was just Coke Gaming was going into random streams and just dropping subs and stuff.
[485:54.63]With like a message like this.
[487:14.08]You can always tell when a brand doesn't give a shit if they literally get your name wrong in what they're doing, or if they just pick a random video or a random stream that you've ever done.
[487:30.80]Dude, Jerma, we here at Brand so, so much loved Grandpa Plays Cube World.
[487:39.88]We really think you'd be great in our brand.
[487:49.30]Hey, Jerma, rock on.
[487:51.04]It's us here from Brand.
[487:53.93]Can we just say, oh, we are such big fans of the rats.
[488:01.13]How many do you own anyways?
[488:04.31]We think rats are cool too.
[488:08.76]I don't own any rats.
[488:09.72]You haven't even seen the video.
[488:16.33]No, you don't get it.
[488:17.47]You don't get it.
[488:18.85]I'm not a fan of rats.
[488:21.27]That's a reference to a video I made in a shitty animation program.
[488:24.42]You didn't see it, though.
[488:25.92]You think I actually have rats in my house and that I have my pets.
[488:29.30]I don't have any.
[488:31.52]Delete the email.
[488:39.20]Dude, Jeremy, we love your worst stream ever.
[488:41.92]Stream, please sponsor us.
[488:44.48]Oh, that is like the Mixer thing.
[488:46.76]Hey, Jeremy, this is Matt from Mixer.
[488:51.62]We're reaching out to you and your rat pack.
[488:53.65]We're big fans to offer you a deal.
[488:55.81]Oh, look, I have to say this because... When will we ever evolve advertising?
[489:09.94]and like PR shit, why does it have to be the same way that it's just been forever?
[489:17.28]Like that shit, nobody, that doesn't work.
[489:20.91]Nobody gives a shit about that.
[489:25.81]Like that, it doesn't do anything for anybody.
[489:29.85]We need to change the way that we advertise because the current system is just annoying.
[489:39.91]Don't you want your brand to not be associated with I'm fucking irritating?
[489:53.09]You sound like a TEDx talker.
[489:58.24]They're literally all out of touch.
[490:00.54]It's just gonna get worse.
[490:05.52]Do your own advertising and get paid for it.
[490:08.33]I think advertising needs to be... I don't know.
[490:13.07]I just feel like random video ads just don't do it anymore.
[490:26.18]Modern advertising is just dude relatable.
[490:28.34]Yeah, but it's dude relatable with like a 30-year-old medium that they're trying to still do.
[490:34.44]It's dude relatable, but with tactics that we've been doing since the 60s.
[490:39.64]You can't be dude relatable when you're not at all and you're using marketing strategies from 1965.
[490:45.40]What's something that I recently bought from an ad?
[491:02.27]Um...
[491:05.87]I don't know.
[491:10.67]Nothing on the internet.
[491:13.67]Because it seems like all internet ads are for like jokey food companies that I'm not going to eat.
[491:20.48]You know what I mean?
[491:21.76]Most of the online ads are weird shitty mobile games that nobody wants to play and 600 calorie per serving like garbage can fucking food.
[491:36.29]That doesn't appeal to me at all.
[491:49.60]And cars.
[491:51.54]Yeah, and cars.
[491:58.51]should do a stream where we watch ads and then rate them well found the account found found the like the hidden advertising account here oh dude yeah it's so up you should watch a bunch of ads on what he streamed that'd be like crazy right epic yeah epic but may I recommend some coke ads uh maybe if you think that would be cool
[492:28.36]They made a few good ones, I think, recently.
[492:31.36]There are some very cool Freezing Coke ads.
[492:33.44]You should check them out.
[492:34.22]Alright, let's go.
[492:45.08]Let's go.
[492:45.74]I could sit here all day and talk about brands and advertising.
[492:48.33]I never ran ads on this stream ever.
[492:56.50]Unless it was like a joke, because like, I don't, I don't care.
[493:02.29]If I'm going to, if someone's going to advertise to you, it's going to be me.
[493:05.59]You know what I mean?
[493:07.31]I want you to hear it from my mouth.
[493:09.93]I want you to hear it from me.
[493:35.27]Anybody get an ad?
[493:37.19]I don't think I get ads.
[493:38.79]I don't think my ads work on this channel.
[493:43.45]I don't think they do.
[493:44.07]I've tried to run ads.
[493:49.82]No, they don't.
[493:51.00]I have tried to run an ad from my dashboard.
[493:53.96]It's running right now.
[493:54.66]It says 28 seconds remaining.
[493:56.72]Did they remove my ads?
[493:58.72]Can I no longer send ads to anybody?
[494:00.84]Have I said this too many times?
[494:07.34]It's saying there's 15 seconds remaining.
[494:09.06]Alright, okay, 12 seconds.
[494:15.74]Why did I lose the ability to run ads on my channel?
[494:20.28]Three, two, one.
[494:24.07]Complete, okay, welcome back.
[494:26.95]Did anybody see an ad?
[494:32.03]No, no, no.
[494:40.46]okay so hey Twitch I just I just want to make sure that you have Twitch like Twitch listen to me um if I run an ad this is good data for you if I run an advertisement and nobody sees it what in the ever living is the reason for running ads
[495:09.23]What's the point of running ads if 75% of all people are not going to see them because they have ad block?
[495:16.09]They're subbed.
[495:17.37]What is this for?
[495:27.80]It's more like 95%.
[495:28.56]The last few times that I've ran ads, I have thought they have not worked because you guys tell me you don't get them.
[495:43.25]Isn't this something else that we could do here?
[495:45.53]Why do we... We're still doing ads, old school video ads that everyone's gonna skip anyways?
[495:52.74]That everyone is going to just not see because they block them?
[495:56.14]I don't get it.
[496:03.20]I don't get it.
[496:08.93]Hey, guys.
[496:11.13]Let's do another one.
[496:15.48]Why are we talking about ads?
[496:17.66]It's important stuff.
[496:18.40]I want you to be aware of it.
[496:20.78]No, I know.
[496:21.26]For like the 10% of you that actually get these, I'm not going to put you through that again.
[496:35.91]Jerma is deprogramming his audience.
[496:38.09]What?
[496:41.75]He's deprogramming his audience.
[496:45.99]what are you talking about you're unplugging I just don't see the point of running ads and Twitch is like oh give us feedback on our ad program here it is uh if there's 2600 people here let's say there was it was 6 000 people here 60 what 7 000 people here at the peak of the stream if like 300 of them get ads what's the point Twitch there you go this is my feedback

[500:32.50]Don't fucking come at me.
[500:33.78]Don't... It's so loud, too.
[500:36.72]It's so loud.
[500:41.34]That's the first thing people see.
[500:54.75]I'm just kidding.
[500:55.47]I love it.
[500:57.08]I love that clip.
[500:58.34]As embarrassing as it is.
[501:01.06]It's just so funny to me.
[501:03.40]Every time somebody comes in... If you're still here from Ludwig's community, I believe it was.
[501:12.12]Thanks for sticking around.
[501:13.71]Yeah, we talk ads here.
[501:15.03]And I stream for like nine hours.
[501:16.65]What the hell am I doing still live?
[501:25.96]They're all gone.

[501:31.69]One in the chat.
[501:34.75]Okay, I know at least two of these people are lying.
[501:43.75]Alright, that's a lot of people.
[501:45.03]I don't think that's that many people.
[501:53.48]Alright.
[501:53.90]I don't... I can't... I have no idea.
[501:56.00]Maybe some of you.
[502:02.30]Most of them are just subbed to you.
[502:03.56]Yeah, I know.
[502:07.89]Hey, Horace2, thanks for the 300 bits.
[502:09.77]I've been waiting days to pog.
[502:11.29]I'm not sure how long I can hold out.
[502:12.69]Good thing I got up to the snow.
[502:13.89]Otherwise, we would have had some pog problems.
[502:22.88]There you go.
[502:23.24]It was like three people.
[502:24.14]Well, hey.
[502:25.94]Three people thanks for coming.

[502:42.49]Gnarly thanks for the $2.50.
[502:43.65]Don't chase the money, says the guy with the 6% tax on his viewers' income.
[502:47.53]Just take your filthy bits, you greedy grinner.
[502:55.29]ice cut digital thanks for 250 Germany you mentioned uncut gems after watching the trailer for it I went and checked out another movie by the same studio called good time I and watched it the entire movie it was incredible when I reopened the stream you were still in the same spot yeah yep I did get up though
[503:20.96]I did get up there.
[503:22.10]I got like 60% of the way through the game.
[503:23.94]That's what everyone told me.
[503:25.52]Pretty cool.
[503:37.31]AmnesticOW gave 50... I forgot about the 50 community subs.
[503:42.25]That's a lot.
[503:45.43]That's a huge amount of money.

[504:04.08]Martin had a meme.
[504:04.72]Thanks for the 2,000 bits.
[504:10.62]$20 from Martin had a meme.
[504:11.34]Jeremy, you know you can't jump on an empty stomach.
[504:13.16]How about fixing that with the new crispy chicken pretzel fries at Burger King?
[504:17.30]Are those real?
[504:19.08]They're crunchy pretzel on the outside, tender white meat chicken on the inside.
[504:22.27]Only available... Is this a real product?
[504:23.79]Because those sound absolutely incredible.
[504:32.28]Don't lie to me here.
[504:32.94]Is that real?
[504:33.57]I'm going to get them.
[504:35.31]When was the last time an ad worked?
[504:37.43]Right now, when a viewer pretended to be a Burger King employee, a fake advertisement for a real product is making me want to buy the actual product.
[504:46.05]So there you go.
[504:47.25]There's the last time.
[504:47.91]It's right now.
[504:48.68]I'm going to go get those as soon as possible.
[504:54.60]Thank you, Martin Hadamine, for the 2,000 bits and the great tip there.
[505:03.70]Thank you Mr. Dask for the 1,500 bits.
[505:06.96]Hey Jerma, it was my birthday today and I just want to thank you for giving me and everyone that's been following you these moments to share.
[505:14.48]Even if Jex clocks out for the night, sometimes jermaJex, jermaMoon, BDWL.
[505:22.63]Seriously though, thanks for the incredible amount of hearty laughter and actual even moments over the years.
[505:28.01]It wasn't even.
[505:29.90]Here's to an awesome and positive holiday season and new year for everyone in jermaHeart.
[505:33.52]P.S.
[505:33.80]Can you say cheeky, breeky, L-U-L?
[505:40.28]There you go.
[505:43.22]First of all, happy birthday.
[505:45.57]Happy birthday.
[505:46.55]Don't know how old you are.
[505:48.19]Hope it's a good one.
[505:54.13]Thanks for watching.
[505:55.51]Thanks for sticking around.
[505:59.01]Have a great birthday.
[506:00.19]It probably isn't your birthday anymore.
[506:01.49]It depends on where you live.
[506:02.59]If you live in the United States, it's the next day.
[506:05.78]But happy birthday regardless.
[506:08.22]Thank you.
[506:11.30]Let's get the credits to roll.
[506:13.60]There was a lot of community subs here tonight, so I feel like this is going to go very quickly.
[506:17.20]And it is.
[506:19.07]Yeah, that's a lot.
[506:20.57]That's a lot of subs.
[506:22.95]All today.
[506:24.99]Clap, roll the credits.
[506:25.99]That's one.
[506:27.27]Zooming.
[506:32.90]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[506:35.46]Do you have a pet rat?
[506:36.16]You should get one.
[506:36.88]I was thinking about it.
[506:37.84]I also want a lizard.
[506:41.32]I wish I could just have a huge zoo.
[506:44.48]You know what I mean?
[506:46.84]If I had the money, the resources, and had just a huge house, I would want to have a bunch of animals.
[506:52.47]I should have a farm.
[506:56.31]Have like a bunch of lizards.
[506:58.55]Like a bunch of rats and ferrets and dogs and cats and shit.
[507:03.12]I think, you know what?
[507:03.66]That's probably my calling.
[507:05.00]I'll tell you for real.
[507:05.68]People saying, what are you going to do after this?
[507:07.81]What are you going to do after this?
[507:09.05]What would you do if Twitch doesn't work out anymore?
[507:10.47]What have you done?
[507:11.63]I'm just going to go be a zoo.
[507:13.92]I don't know.
[507:16.35]I'll go work for some pet store or go work for like a clinic or something like that.
[507:23.83]I volunteered already at an animal shelter and I loved it.
[507:27.49]That's what I'll do.
[507:28.33]That's what I'm going to do.
[507:28.97]That's probably what'll happen.
[507:40.83]Weird flex.
[507:41.65]What?
[507:42.53]Being a zoo?
[507:48.72]Let someone else build it.
[507:51.94]I forgot about the gull vet.
[507:53.27]That was so funny.
[507:54.59]But thank you seriously everybody for subbing.
[507:56.11]There's a shitload of you.
[507:58.42]Thank you.
[508:01.07]Uh, Snooze and Coffner, thanks for the 250.
[508:02.31]Hey, first of all, thanks for looking at my F-tier Sour Tower in the FTK stream.
[508:07.19]Looking forward to next time, it was really fun.
[508:08.83]So, can I get an audience with the king from my founder privileges?
[508:12.99]Well, so next time you see me, take a look at my skin from all sides.
[508:16.06]Also, can't wait for more Jump King at the end when everyone starts rooting for you.
[508:19.04]It's great!
[508:21.52]I do think you can make it to the top.
[508:22.84]It's more up your alley than getting over it, in my opinion.
[508:24.98]Also, apparently there's a Surge 2 now.
[508:29.06]guys did get behind me you did that's why I didn't stop I was like yeah talking a bunch of and I was you know a little angry and I was like but then you guys got behind me and you were just like cheering me on and I'm like I can't stop and then I had to pretend to be normal for a raid so and then we had we just kept going and that was a push that we needed
[509:03.94]And then you talk to yourself immediately after.
[509:06.04]Very normal.
[509:11.32]You pretend to be normal every raid.
[509:17.68]Do I?
[509:20.92]He does.
[509:25.43]What do you mean?
[509:27.01]What does that mean?
[509:31.39]You go into tuber mode?
[509:39.64]You have a raid personality.
[509:41.36]You act like you're in front of your parents.
[509:50.54]Yeah, but think about it.
[509:51.71]Okay, listen, this is important.
[509:54.11]If a bunch of new people that have never heard my voice before, they come to the stream, boom, they're put right in the middle of it.
[510:05.08]Do you think this is the first thing that they're going to want to hear?
[510:08.85]okay okay okay you know I don't know if that's the first thing you so I'm gonna be like hey I'm just trying to like introduce myself video games suck video games I'm just trying to give video games suck video games suck
[510:30.93]I'm just trying to give him a very normal, hey, this is what I'm doing, introduction.
[510:36.61]You're too formal.
[510:38.09]I can't help it.
[510:42.32]And we'll play The Surge 2 soon.
[510:44.56]I want to just make sure that I hate it.
[510:46.42]Why?
[510:47.54]Why would I do that?
[510:48.28]We're going to do it.
[510:49.32]Broluck, thanks for the 500 bits.
[510:51.36]You said it was simpler making 2012 YouTube videos.
[510:53.80]I couldn't think of something more simple than taking five hours to push a sleeping dog's character into an ocean.
[510:59.02]I did that, though.
[511:01.00]That's the thing that a lot of people, I don't, I'm not sure how many people realize, a lot of the stuff that's in some of these old videos, like the 2012, 13, 14, 15 kind of era of me making YouTube videos, I did that.
[511:15.33]I sat in a grenade room for like three or four hours.
[511:17.27]That was not a joke.
[511:18.21]That was real.
[511:21.47]I wasn't just saying that in the video.
[511:23.45]I couldn't, I was in there for a long time.
[511:27.91]I did that stuff off stream and recorded it and edited it down.
[511:33.85]Joel says he's going to punish you.
[511:34.97]Joel, don't.
[511:35.50]Joel, don't do it.
[511:36.36]Joel, don't do it.
[511:36.94]Don't do it.
[511:37.36]Joel, I'm telling you, listen to somebody that just like walked out.
[511:42.02]I just got out.
[511:46.84]You're going to... Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[511:48.98]Joel, if you do it, listen to me.
[511:50.90]I want to hear you.
[511:53.28]I need my bias to be confirmed.
[511:55.94]You're going to get to the basketball hoop.
[511:58.93]There's a jump that's a basketball hoop.
[512:02.29]That's all I need to tell you.
[512:03.45]And when you do it and you see it and you do it and you're going to miss it a few times and you're going to go, what's this dumbass basketball hoop?
[512:11.38]Oh, no, that's what Jerma was talking about.
[512:14.40]That's what he was saying.
[512:20.15]And you're not going to say it on stream.
[512:22.89]You're going to just internally be like, oh, fuck that.
[512:27.26]Fuck that.
[512:28.88]I should have listened to Jerma.
[512:31.56]He's smart.
[512:37.48]Race him.
[512:39.30]I'm not racing you in Jump King.
[512:40.64]No, no, you can't race somebody in Jump King.
[512:43.96]It's too hard.
[512:45.27]It's too fast.
[512:46.37]No, I can't do it.
[512:47.13]I'm not doing that.
[512:48.25]I'm not doing it.
[512:48.81]I'm not doing it.
[512:49.43]I don't want to get embarrassed.
[512:50.31]I don't want Joel to get embarrassed.
[512:52.39]I don't want to get embarrassed.
[512:53.87]No, no, no.
[512:54.69]Let's do like a who can click the mouse fastest.
[512:59.42]I got that one.
[513:06.71]Is he live right now?
[513:08.93]Did he just turn his stream on?
[513:18.17]He just turned his stream.
[513:20.21]He's been streaming.
[513:21.89]He's on your stream right now.
[513:24.77]Get out of here.
[513:27.61]Get out of my bedroom.
[513:30.23]Get out of here, mom.
[513:31.52]Why are you coming in here?
[513:34.30]Close the door.
[513:35.00]I need to lock this door.
[513:38.38]I'm playing my... I'm... Joel, if you play Jump King... And hi, everybody, on Joel's stream.
[513:46.02]Hope you're having a great night.
[513:49.25]Good to see you again, first of all.
[513:50.73]I wanted to say thank you for jumping on the stream and checking me out for a little bit.
[513:58.71]How are you?
[513:59.21]I hope you're doing good.
[513:59.83]If you're going to play Jump King, let me just give you a quick little tip about Jump King.
[514:02.37]You're going to get to a couple of parts where you're going to really, really, really be mad.
[514:06.83]And, alright, okay.
[514:09.73]Okay, okay, okay.
[514:10.81]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[514:12.49]What's he saying?
[514:13.15]I need to know.
[514:15.37]Hey, do you have all your channel points activated?
[514:21.16]Do you have anything cool for it?
[514:22.80]What, what, hey, what, if you, if you're gonna do something cool for your channel points, what would it be?
[514:25.50]So I can fucking steal it.
[514:28.00]If you gotta do something cool for your channel points, would you like, I don't know, do something cool and I can maybe take it from you?
[514:32.68]What are you doing for your channel points?
[514:38.57]He's not even, he's not even, what, he's on a black screen.
[514:45.97]Anyway, back to the game.
[514:50.06]Back to the game.
[514:52.49]You see... What?
[514:55.99]Why is it so funny?
[514:56.99]What is even happening?
[514:59.93]I don't understand.
[515:01.97]He doesn't know.
[515:02.73]He doesn't know that I made that game.
[515:08.48]He doesn't know.
[515:09.76]You know what I mean?
[515:12.64]He's watching you now.
[515:13.46]No, he's not.
[515:14.80]Now he's listening.
[515:15.42]Oh, yeah?
[515:16.58]Check it out.
[515:16.88]No, no, no.
[515:18.84]Yeah, so thanks for the subs.
[515:21.04]Appreciate that.
[515:24.88]Snoozycopter, thanks for the $2.50.
[515:27.32]No, that's a really cool conversation to have, though, about just advertising.
[515:32.26]Advertising is really strange.
[515:34.95]And the way that we advertise to each other, I think it's a human thing.
[515:41.67]We've got to be more human, way more human than we already are.
[515:48.66]so we can move on from that really really good deep uh intelligent conversation that's happening on my live stream that's what we do we have and that's why a ton of people if you're like into that kind of thing you like we have a lot of interesting conversations on this stream um yeah that's true we yeah we oh
[516:18.09]What's going on?
[516:19.47]Somebody's here.
[516:20.75]I don't understand.
[516:29.67]What?
[516:29.95]What do you mean somebody's here?
[516:32.77]Here's what we're going to do.
[516:35.38]I'm going to take his offer and say, yes, I'll play Jump King with him.
[516:40.12]I'll school him in it, you know.
[516:42.88]That's right.
[516:43.44]That's right, Jeremy.
[516:44.30]I know you're... Let's play...
[516:47.60]I'll say yes to it.
[516:50.36]Oh, fuck, he is a streamer.
[516:54.31]I'll say yes to it.
[516:55.01]Hey, hey, we have about... On my stream, we do... We have a... Once a month, we do this thing where we get together and read a book on stream.
[517:03.15]Um...
[517:05.74]We read a book on stream and we go over it with each other.
[517:08.56]Each person in chat does one page.
[517:12.70]And then we say it out loud.
[517:13.58]Kind of like, you guys remember how much fun that was?
[517:16.09]When we would, you'd go around the classroom and everyone would read like two paragraphs and it was the dumbest fucking thing on Earth.
[517:22.65]And for some reason, the teacher thought that that was a good idea.
[517:25.85]to have everybody not be able to do any reading comprehension and have like 25 to 30 people all read out loud in different voices for different characters I loved it when it got to my part because I would just I was always hoping there would be a quote you know what I mean because it was like oh and then that person said I would just put on voice on I'd be like get out of here you you bastard
[517:47.75]And everyone would go, whoa, that was such a good, you could do voices?
[517:52.18]And I'm like, yeah, I got to bow.
[517:55.30]And then I get up and I teach the class.
[517:58.76]And the teacher sits down and starts listening to me.
[518:02.47]See, Jerma has lost it.
[518:04.67]Jerma's having a cranky.
[518:16.60]Ego maniac, I see.
[518:25.10]What happened to, somebody said, what happened to Jump King?
[518:29.03]I beat it.
[518:30.41]It was easy.
[518:34.37]Wait, wait, wait, Joel.
[518:37.17]It wasn't easy.
[518:38.35]Quiet, quiet.
[518:38.81]This is important.
[518:39.35]I'm going to show something on the screen.
[518:41.75]Play Jump King with me.
[518:42.99]Just watch.
[518:43.43]I need you to look at something.
[518:44.91]I'm going to show you a t-shirt.
[518:46.13]I got a t-shirt on.
[518:47.35]No, forget about the t-shirt.
[518:48.27]Play Jump King with me.
[518:49.64]Listen, listen.
[518:50.66]I need you to watch.
[518:51.34]I'm going to show you a t-shirt.
[518:52.90]I got a t-shirt on.
[518:53.36]You know what I could do?
[518:54.08]I could just shut the stream off now.
[518:55.32]What do you think about this?
[518:56.16]What do you think about it?
[518:56.76]What is the first thing you think about when you see this?
[518:58.32]A little grumpy dumpy.
[519:00.26]The old Jerma grumpy dumpy.
[519:02.25]What do you think about it?
[519:03.11]What is the first thing you think about when you see this?
[519:05.09]A little grumpy dumpy.
[519:08.05]What do you think?
[519:09.53]Grumpy dumpy.
[519:10.23]Looser.
[519:10.39]Looser.
[519:10.57]I see what I see right now.
[519:11.67]There we go.
[519:11.97]What I see right now.
[519:26.34]Alright, he didn't say it.
[519:29.06]You guys are crazy.
[519:30.10]This stream sucks.
[519:32.14]Which one?
[519:32.54]Mine or yours?
[519:33.64]They're talking about you. They're talking about YOU.
[519:35.80]My stream's over. My stream is over.
[519:40.36]I'm done!
[519:41.36]My stream ain't been on for like an hour!
[519:43.22]Yeah, your stream is fucking over.
[519:45.10]When you come around, you pigeon shit.
[519:47.04]You pigeon poop all over my stream.
[519:50.22]You give me these challenges.
[519:54.01]Will, I got the end of my stream.
[519:58.34]-be fucking more loud on stream-
[519:59.34]Alright I'm- okay that's it. We're out.
[520:04.34]Thank you, thank- thank you for- it's like I'm getting deja vu.
[520:11.34]This just reminds me of the Tay Zonday.

[520:24.34]You dick.
[520:26.81]When are you gonna play Halo again?

[520:40.44]Let me tell you something.
[520:41.64]We're not gonna go down that road.
[520:43.12]Let me tell you something.
[520:45.28]Let me tell you something.
[520:46.46]We're not gonna go down that road.
[520:47.96]Let me tell you something.
[520:49.78]Dick. Dick. Dick. Dick. Dick. Dick. Dick. Dick. Dick. Dick.
[520:59.32]Why's he gotta be like that?
[521:04.15]What's with your echo? What's going on with your echo?
[521:11.15]You got me open in like 5 tabs? What the fuck are you doing dude? Relax.
[521:30.15]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[521:32.99]Goodnight, guy.
[521:40.64]Good luck on Jump King.
[521:41.50]The game sucks.
[522:00.73]Wait, is he still watching?
[522:01.65]Joel, are you still streaming?
[522:03.58]Meme.
[522:04.54]Is he actually turning the stream up or what?
[522:06.64]Meme and violent stream.
[522:10.02]Is he going to bed or is he doing something else?
[522:14.04]Alright, well we'll go rate him after.
[522:19.74]See you guys tomorrow.
[522:21.53]We did have a couple more bits come in during that nonsense there.
[522:24.88]We had Wince Ryan, thanks for the 300 bits, sliding it at the end, sorry.
[522:28.74]Don't apologize for giving me money.
[522:31.36]Thank you.
[522:32.42]Despite all the obstacles you guys faced, I'm so happy you were able to stream FTK for a bit.
[522:36.15]I was part of the Farmers Guild and spent the entire time just planting wheat and corralling chickens while hearing chaos in the background.
[522:42.73]It was fantastic.
[522:43.45]That's my favorite part.
[522:45.19]That's my favorite part.
[522:48.52]Is that people could just do whatever they want.
[522:50.94]And not have to even be participating at all.
[522:53.30]In, like, the ridiculous nonsense.
[522:56.62]Brawlock, thanks for the 500 bits.
[522:57.70]Have you heard of... DCDC?
[523:02.81]1032V.
[523:03.51]150W Boost Adjust Module Mobile.
[523:07.85]What is this?
[523:08.87]It's a really interesting thing from... I just thought they'd let you know.
[523:12.93]What the hell is... What is this?
[523:15.76]Laptop Car?
[523:20.29]From Bang?
[523:21.35]I don't want to say the rest of that.
[523:23.13]That's a website that has Bang in it.
[523:24.69]I'm not going to read the rest of that.
[523:30.95]And that's it.
[523:31.69]We'll see you tomorrow.
[523:37.34]See you tomorrow.
[523:38.22]Without knowing what we're playing, we're either going to play Jump King again, or we'll do Nancy Drew.
[523:42.50]I don't know.
[523:44.08]We'll figure it out.
[523:45.28]Have a great rest of your night and have a good sleep.
[523:46.86]We went very late tonight, I know.
[523:49.88]And go tell Joe hello.
[523:55.11]Let's go ahead and queue that up right now.
[523:57.13]Why don't we?
[524:04.25]See you tomorrow.
[524:08.65]Take care, guys.
[524:09.70]Good night.
[524:31.48]you
