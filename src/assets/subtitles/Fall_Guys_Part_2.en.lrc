[00:01.34]Alright.
[00:02.54]Let me just change the category.
[00:04.85]And... Oh, I need my controller.
[00:07.97]Do you guys play this game with a controller or do you play it with a keyboard and mouse?
[00:20.74]How the hell would you play this with keyboard and mouse?
[00:22.26]I think that would be really, really hard to do.
[00:31.37]Okay.
[00:33.55]You can't see anything yet.
[00:34.99]You will very soon.
[00:47.33]There we are.
[00:47.79]Okay, so... Oh, I forgot to turn the music off.
[01:00.56]We keep the music off.
[01:07.20]Eh, we'll keep it on.
[01:10.94]We just change the title and we can go.
[01:14.08]Uh, the title's, uh, gonna get out of prison today.
[01:18.10]Um, whatever, I don't care.
[01:20.20]That's, that's fine.
[01:31.42]This fits, I mean, a little bit.
[01:41.35]I'm definitely not going to come even close, by the way, to winning a single match.
[01:52.78]There's a lot of colors in this game, and... Change it to finally out of prison.
[02:07.06]Just keep making jokes like you're actually getting out of prison today.
[02:12.90]Like wait, why would they let me- I'm streaming Fall Guys from prison?
[02:28.59]Yes.
[02:32.19]You guys already all know that that's bullshit.
[02:35.59]It would be a thing that we do to the one person that ends up coming to the- and I- I'm gonna lose.
[02:50.83]Maybe not.
[02:51.43]Maybe not.
[02:51.79]There's always somebody worse than you and there's always somebody better than you.
[02:55.24]Remember that.
[02:55.66]It's a very important thing to remember in life.
[03:09.13]he's a sage sage I'm a sage that's pretty sage-like if he wins he goes free what like everyone all the other inmates are playing right now
[03:31.26]Whoever wins this gets the get-out-of-jail-free card?
[03:39.31]That's really messed up.
[03:46.29]It's already a series?
[03:48.39]Dead Man Wonderland.
[03:49.55]Is that like a show?
[04:01.64]I hate the egg one.
[04:02.34]The egg one's always too hard.
[04:06.19]Sorry.
[04:06.51]You just don't want to come in last.
[04:14.53]And I'm going to get that gold neg.
[04:17.50]I'll get it.
[04:18.12]Yeah.
[04:40.71]You know, this is not even that interesting to me because you just see this shit on Easter every year anyways.
[04:45.21]A bunch of little kids just fucking going nuts looking for the hidden eggs.
[04:57.70]Holy shit.
[05:00.88]You guys ever do that thing?
[05:01.86]Or you guys or your parents ever do that thing with somebody?
[05:03.76]It always caused a huge problem for some reason.
[05:06.71]It just did.
[05:09.14]all the little hidden eggs for Easter.
[05:11.98]And we're gonna do the egg hunt!
[05:13.86]And for some reason, like, one of the participants, somebody that came over that day, or somebody that was there, or an aunt, or an uncle, or a friend, or a family, doesn't matter, put, like, a $20 bill, or, like, a $50 bill in one of them.
[05:28.84]Like, a $10 bill would be in one of them.
[05:31.44]And it's like, dude, like, don't!
[05:33.91]You... Come on!
[05:35.31]Like, whoever gets that's gonna get, like, 50 bucks?! !
[05:39.68]These are like six-year-olds.
[05:41.27]They don't even know what money is.
[05:44.39]Don't do that.
[05:46.15]Put like a Reese's Pieces in there, man.
[05:48.67]Don't put like a $20 bill in there.
[05:51.07]You're going to start a fight.
[05:55.34]And then everyone just says, well, you know, we'll just use that for something.
[06:02.47]Like the kid doesn't even get the money like his parents do.
[06:11.36]Oh wow, you have little John got a $50 bill in there.
[06:16.79]Oh, good for you, sport.
[06:19.29]Mommy will hold on to that one.
[06:20.61]I think the parents, you just go out to a nice dinner with you and your husband.
[06:37.59]Somebody said, what's wrong with your family?
[06:45.12]I saw at least a handful of people say that that was something they remembered.
[06:52.98]You can't just do any amount of money is bad, because if you put a dollar in there, even a seven-year-old knows, oh, that's fucking nothing, dude.
[07:00.29]Like, even when you're like eight, nine years old, it's like, oh, this one's got money in it!
[07:04.73]It's two dollars!
[07:06.69]Oh, this is not, this is nothing.
[07:09.49]A dollar?
[07:10.97]Why is this even in the egg?
[07:15.89]And then you look over and your uncle's smoking a fucking cigarette in the corner like, YEAH YOU DON'T SPEND A DOLLAR IN ONE PLACE!
[07:25.33]Obviously it was a way of making a joke with one of the other uncles or aunts or something.
[07:32.86]We're winning.
[07:40.61]I literally cannot even buy candy with a dollar because of taxes.
[07:50.83]We literally might be related.
[07:52.31]I don't know.
[07:52.95]What are the 6,000 people here?
[07:56.63]What's the percentage that somebody in this chat might be like genetically related to me somehow?
[08:04.87]It's probably fairly high.
[08:17.90]Everyone.
[08:20.58]would be weird your mother watches the streams yeah but I mean not somebody that I know is watching like I'm sure one or two of you guys in this chat have shared some old like shoemaker back in like the 1400s or something
[08:55.77]Don't you understand?
[08:56.35]There was like 40 people on Earth at one point.
[09:03.23]There was like 2,000 people that lived in like Connecticut as of like 1442.
[09:08.52]There weren't that many people.
[09:26.95]They're not even gonna score one point.
[09:31.67]Classic American edu- Okay, somebody's cheating I think.
[09:34.13]I think we have a cheater.
[09:34.77]Is somebody cheating?
[09:37.58]We might have a cheater.
[09:40.02]No, I think we're just good.
[09:46.46]Yeah, all that mattered was you had like a little town and it was like 17 houses.
[09:53.52]And like a hundred people lived in your town.
[09:56.43]And one of you guys sold milk.
[09:57.85]The other one... Yeah, you had corn and shit.
[10:01.37]And some of you guys were like tough and were like defenders.
[10:04.45]And some of you guys had... You know, one of you guys was a blacksmith.
[10:07.55]We all just like got along.
[10:08.87]We all just spent a bunch of time together.
[10:10.75]Everybody had one job and we all just did it.
[10:24.95]Defenders?
[10:25.63]Yeah, I don't know.
[10:26.39]It'd be like fights.
[10:27.91]People would kind of try and steal the corn and we'd have to have somebody fight.
[10:30.63]It's not gonna be me.
[10:33.09]Look at me.
[10:33.51]I would be a wizard.
[10:44.67]I would be one of the fucking wizards.
[10:46.11]You know what I mean?
[10:48.90]Oh, I'm doing that thing again where I combine two things, one in real life and not one in real life.
[10:54.38]Alright, never mind.
[11:05.82]It's 10 to nothing.
[11:09.28]Holy shit.
[11:12.02]I feel like I'm watching Fall Guys.
[11:14.52]This is ridiculous.
[11:15.68]12 to nothing?
[11:22.07]Wait, that means I'm on a team with a really good player.
[11:35.04]Six people.
[11:36.76]Alright.
[11:37.38]If I win this one, I actually earned it.
[11:45.69]I won one game last stream.
[11:48.96]It's the tail one.
[11:55.46]The only game I won last stream is because the servers went offline and 35 people disconnected.
[12:06.94]This guy's got it.
[12:11.81]Yup.
[12:31.58]BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS!
[12:34.34]THEY FELL FOR THE SCOOBY-DOO TRICK!
[12:46.42]NOOOO!
[13:00.73]NOOOO!
[13:03.90]Alright, cut him off, cut him off, cut him off, he's gonna go this way, cut him, cut him, cut him, cut him, cut him, cut him!
[13:15.00]Why did you do that?
[13:24.00]You can't Scooby-Doo me.
[13:26.00]I'm the original goddamn fucking Scooby-Doo. You're not gonna be able to do that.
[13:55.43]No, he saw me!
[13:57.67]He saw me!
[14:07.90]He was running down there.
[14:09.12]I was waiting for him to run down.
[14:10.66]And he saw me at the last second.
[14:13.62]He instantly turned around.
[14:14.94]He freaked out and ripped the other direction.
[14:33.97]Damn it.
[14:38.91]Holy shit.
[14:39.53]Two crowns, bro.
[14:40.35]You got two crowns?
[14:41.31]Dude, pog.
[14:42.14]Two crowns?
[14:42.84]Uh, yeah.
[14:55.23]The first one was for free.
[14:58.15]Because I played long enough for them to give me one.
[15:01.29]The second one
[15:03.81]35 people disconnected.
[15:06.20]And I outlasted them all.
[15:07.74]With my fiber optic internet.
[15:21.13]That's a first, yeah.
[15:21.93]Alright, come on.
[15:28.91]But yes, I did technically win one.
[15:32.81]I've come pretty close two or three times.
[15:34.49]Maybe a little bit more than that.
[15:37.24]I've come pretty close maybe five or six times.
[15:40.02]Like the final three, final five.
[15:41.54]They really are ruining everything, aren't they?
[15:57.98]I'm going to take the initiative.
[15:58.83]I'm going the other way.
[16:24.05]Get out of my way.
[16:25.05]Every time I touch somebody, I fall over.
[16:26.91]Really?
[16:43.47]I'm in trouble.
[16:44.67]Wait, a bunch of people just got dumped.
[16:46.91]Okay, who is weighing this down?
[17:04.45]He's in for a life sentence.
[17:07.51]Yeah, I forgot the prison thing.
[17:17.47]I'll get there.
[17:18.04]I got it.
[17:18.40]I got it.
[17:18.72]I got it.
[17:19.00]I got it.
[17:30.44]When are you going to play Jailbreak on TF2?
[17:33.60]I played a bunch of Jailbreak for Counter-Strike a very long time ago, and I actually probably have three or four videos on the subject.
[17:50.75]And they're not, they're just stupid ass videos.
[17:54.41]It's,
[17:58.46]That was so much fun though back when it was really popular.
[18:00.89]Those are my only good videos?
[18:11.25]I disagree.
[18:11.79]But it's because I like free kill a bunch of people in those videos?
[18:27.30]Do you get the stamp of your approval?
[18:40.02]What's your best video in your opinion?
[18:42.26]Um... I don't think it's... I can't really do that.
[18:47.85]I feel like most videos I made, I really liked.
[18:55.43]for the most part yeah but I mean the live action Jerma rumble is like just that's that's like just the complete was the complete package for me it just I had so much fun making that it was so it was such a fun experience doing that and it was just so grueling to do it but I think it was so much fun and just like yeah like this just the setup for how that came to be in the first place was just I had a lot of fun doing it so
[19:27.56]or the uh the photos are in that was another one that really liked that one five six alright I'm gonna be in a good position again as long as we don't lose this in the last 10 seconds
[20:10.15]choking now we're good we're fine we're fine we're fine hey when are you gonna beat God Hand um I don't know I'm not sure I'm gonna go back to it I had my fun with it I don't know if I'm gonna do it it's a very hard game and it makes me very very nervous and scared and anxious when I play it because I might not beat the game and I have to try really hard
[20:40.46]It's very hard.
[20:41.08]It's a fun game.
[20:51.22]It's because of the casino, isn't it?
[20:53.06]No.
[20:53.31]Grab a tail.
[21:01.07]You know what?
[21:03.82]Everyone runs around like crazy.
[21:06.19]Trying desperately to grab somebody's tail in this.
[21:09.59]I'm going to show you the way that you should play this.
[21:13.27]And that is... Don't do anything.
[21:17.05]Just hang out and just scope out.
[21:18.73]Like the guy in the lower right.
[21:20.59]He is hiding right now.
[21:22.92]That's the guy I'm going to keep my eye on because... Never mind, he already lost it.
[21:27.24]You want to keep your eye on the people that are actually hiding.
[21:29.62]That aren't being seen by anybody but you.
[21:35.42]This person right here is the target.
[21:38.18]See them on the left?
[21:40.44]That person right there is the target.
[21:45.59]Like a fucking bald eagle.
[21:47.33]We are going to stalk this person.
[21:50.43]And we're going to strike at the very last moment.
[22:01.98]Just give me yours.
[22:02.92]You walked right by me.
[22:21.59]As you see, we got the fucking prey that we wanted.
[22:26.45]Told you I was gonna get that guy.
[22:38.86]That dropped a lot of people.
[22:48.38]Yeah, you hunted that child.
[22:50.30]We already talked about this the last time I played this game.
[22:53.78]Everyone says that it's a bunch of children, but we're all like 30 plus.
[22:58.06]At least 25 plus.
[23:00.76]Everyone says the, oh yeah, like, oh, I'm beating all these kids.
[23:04.20]And they're all just 27.
[23:05.82]Like, just sitting in their houses.
[23:13.14]Find the path?
[23:15.64]Oh, shit!
[23:19.26]Wait!
[23:20.64]Who knows the right way?
[23:22.14]Somebody move!
[23:29.14]Ow!
[23:29.20]Get out of the way!
[23:33.80]Out of the way!
[23:34.12]Out of the way!
[23:34.50]Out of the way!
[23:34.88]Out of the way!
[23:35.26]Out of the way!
[23:35.66]Out of the way!
[23:35.96]Get out of my way!
[23:40.61]You just have to get across the finish line.
[23:46.21]That bastard!
[23:53.95]Shit!
[23:58.75]Get out of my way!
[24:12.71]You fucking asshole!
[24:18.90]The first time I've ever seen that game.
[24:37.31]That one's fun.
[24:40.17]Okay, I want more fun, weird stuff like that, and less everybody run the same direction and get squished by the same door.
[24:50.62]I like stuff like that.
[24:52.06]It's fun.
[24:52.62]Like this one.
[24:53.40]This is the one I'm talking about.
[24:54.34]I don't like this one.
[25:07.05]This one would be funny with like five people or like ten people.
[25:13.52]As it stands right now, everyone just smushes everywhere and it doesn't matter.
[25:17.34]It's just someone's going to walk into one.
[25:25.64]Like if this was ten people, then a bunch of people would really have a problem.
[25:29.56]It would be fun.
[25:30.46]Funny.
[25:40.18]Because once one person goes through, every single person knows the answer.
[25:43.40]But if there was only like four or five of us, someone's gonna make a mistake.
[26:03.31]He hates it.
[26:08.80]I flew across the map.
[26:10.18]What, you mean like actually?
[26:11.06]Like flew or fell?
[26:25.89]Like flying and falling are two different actions.
[26:32.23]Like guy hacking flying and guy falling off edge.
[26:39.43]Got launched.
[26:46.32]Remember, we can see your cheat engine.
[26:48.36]Hold on.
[26:56.15]This is important.
[26:57.69]In a minute, this is important.
[27:05.89]Hug the right side.
[27:08.17]They all came on the right side.
[27:19.06]Yeah, we're good.
[27:23.82]Ooh, I just missed that one.
[27:26.96]Just missed, just missed, just missed, just missed, just missed, just missed.
[27:32.31]It's OK.
[27:33.71]Qualified.
[27:45.08]he's cheating confirm oh yeah hold on actually this is gonna be hard to do never mind I was gonna put a full screen video of like just computer glitch noises and words and scrambled letters
[28:14.28]And accidentally show it on stream.
[28:21.53]Wasn't worth it.
[28:25.13]Avoid the walls and stay on the platform.
[28:27.18]I haven't seen this one either.
[28:28.32]He didn't commit to it.
[28:34.42]Well, I'm currently in the middle of a game where I can't really stop.
[28:38.27]So what do we have to do?
[28:40.87]We have to fit through what?
[28:46.72]I get it.
[28:47.00]This person's cheating.
[28:51.82]How do you do that?
[28:52.24]How do you cheat?
[28:52.66]I think you have to jump on somebody else's head.
[29:01.35]You do.
[29:01.75]You do.
[29:02.21]You do.
[29:02.63]You do.
[29:03.03]You do.
[29:04.71]Why do I care about cheating?
[29:10.35]I could have just won that normally.
[29:12.07]I didn't have to do that.
[29:22.58]Definition of hubris, yeah.
[29:28.90]You gotta get up there before it even starts.
[29:30.80]Yeah.
[29:31.32]Oh, well.
[29:32.92]Shit, I was doing pretty good on that one, too.
[29:49.63]What happened to one or two rounds?
[29:52.20]I'm still having fun.
[29:56.48]I want to get to the final round again.
[29:59.92]Whatever happens, happens.
[30:12.09]Somebody fucked that whole thing up.
[30:13.25]I don't know who did, but apparently it ruined everybody.
[30:41.65]You can't just run forward.
[30:43.83]Oh no.
[30:47.65]I'm in trouble.
[30:48.51]I'm in trouble.
[30:49.17]I got... Can't lose the first round.
[30:54.33]Can't lose the first round, man.
[30:56.47]Can't... Just lose.
[30:57.97]I fell off.
[31:03.23]It's just... Let's smush everybody together.
[31:06.97]And somebody's always gonna get the short end of the stick.
[31:20.69]First round Andy.
[31:21.68]I was in the last round before that.
[31:42.07]Last round Larry.
[31:49.64]This is the worst fall guy streamer.
[31:51.42]I don't believe that for a second.
[31:53.30]No way.
[31:54.88]No way.
[31:57.38]Not a chance.
[31:58.94]You know how I know that?
[32:00.22]Because there are like 5,000 people playing this right now.
[32:04.84]That are streaming this.
[32:06.75]There's not a chance that I'm the worst one.
[32:08.37]Someone's always better than you.
[32:11.67]Someone's always worse than you though.
[32:12.79]Remember that.
[32:13.23]It's important.
[32:26.19]You are the worst.
[32:27.31]I'm not the worst Fall Guys player.
[32:30.17]Being, okay, being the worst Fall Guys player is like saying... It's like saying you're bad at like the jumpy house.
[32:49.56]No, it's, you're not, no one's bad at this game.
[32:53.28]No one's good at this game.
[33:03.71]There is no bad.
[33:04.47]There is no good.
[33:05.25]There is just Jumpy House.
[33:09.20]He's coping.
[33:10.48]Let me have it then.
[33:20.02]You don't have to come in first place.
[33:21.63]It doesn't matter if you come in last place.
[33:23.29]You got to jump in the Jumpy House.
[33:24.55]It's fine.
[33:30.97]I'm really not qualified.
[33:32.19]I'm at the fucking finish line.
[33:35.63]Shit.
[33:36.19]Maybe I am the worst streamer for this game.
[33:38.59]I really might be the worst Fall Guys streamer.
[33:40.90]That's sad to think about.
[33:43.08]My ego is getting in the way right now.
[33:44.40]And it sucks.
[33:45.12]Like my ego right now is like, no, no, it's not possible, Jeremy.
[33:47.80]You can't be.
[33:49.42]I mean, that's two in a row.
[33:51.03]If I make it three, then it's possible.
[33:56.76]Hey, no, I'm right.
[33:58.04]At least I got to jump in the jumpy house.
[34:00.48]It was kind of fun.
[34:05.20]Chat got to you.
[34:06.30]No, they didn't.
[34:13.11]No, don't lock me out.
[34:14.87]Don't lock me out after that.
[34:20.01]You didn't qualify for the next jumpy house.
[34:23.09]It's called a bouncy house?
[34:27.09]Open up a thesaurus and tell me what the word next to bouncy is.
[34:43.06]Jumpy is not a word.
[34:44.16]What do you mean it's not a word?
[34:57.10]Dude, there's so much... Jumpy... Oh my god, you guys.
[35:05.58]It's called a bouncy castle?
[35:07.24]It's a jumpy house!
[35:08.26]It doesn't matter!
[35:09.26]Is this the hill you want to die on?
[35:14.91]Actually, it's called bouncy castle, not jumpy house.
[35:18.97]That's the fucking bootleg shitty version.
[35:21.73]That's how you know it's a fake.
[35:37.17]Oh, that's funny.
[35:38.95]Okay, I can't do three.
[35:39.83]If I get three in a row, then I'm the worst Fall Guys streamer on Twitch.
[35:42.22]Alright, I agree with you.
[35:44.08]But that's not gonna happen.
[35:51.09]I'm so scared that it's going to, but it's not going to.
[35:53.35]I can't be the worst Fall Guys player on Twitch.
[36:16.29]What are you supposed to do?
[36:41.53]Why did you do that?
[36:43.73]He knows.
[36:44.45]He knows.
[36:45.01]He's new.
[36:57.94]Not the worst Fall Guys player on Twitch.
[37:03.08]He's screen cheating.
[37:10.02]Alright, boogers just- I just- good thing this is why I don't have a camera on, thank god.
[37:20.73]In the middle of all this, somebody just writes, Resident Evil 4.
[37:28.65]Not today.
[37:29.17]It's like Inception.
[37:35.56]I know it's an Inception campaign.
[37:40.28]I'm aware of it now.
[37:59.69]That's not good.
[38:00.27]Alright, I'll tell you, I'm solely responsible for two of our points.
[38:19.22]I mean, after offense and defense like that, you're gonna tell me I'm the worst ball guys player on Twitch?
[38:51.33]No, they- Why is Blue over here helping them?
[39:10.73]Can we get one?
[39:28.64]I was not the worst player.
[39:29.60]I was responsible for at least three points.
[39:31.22]Where did the points go?
[39:47.55]I'm not the whole team.
[39:48.89]The team has to step up and start moving stuff.
[39:56.44]Yeah, I'm out of prison.
[39:57.22]I made it.
[39:57.54]I made it out.
[40:00.17]An hour ago, actually.
[40:01.47]An hour and a half ago.
[40:02.83]A little less than that.
[40:04.27]Maybe like 40 minutes.
[40:11.50]Alright, this is my last one.
[40:13.16]I'm done after this.
[40:13.83]This better be a good one.
[40:30.56]He needs to get out of jumpy prison.
[40:32.03]Yes.
[41:22.52]It's not a bad one.
[41:24.34]It's not bad unless you are the first person to lose.
[41:27.80]If it's 40 people, as long as you're number 40, it wasn't a bad round.
[41:33.85]You got in.
[41:34.45]It doesn't matter.
[41:44.00]It only matters when you get down to the last round.
[41:46.04]You just have to qualify.
[42:02.12]And having good internet qualifies too, because if 25 people drop here... Still counts.
[42:10.11]I don't want to do this one again.
[42:11.05]Alright, how many premium skins do we have on our team?
[42:27.78]Two?
[42:40.75]Give me these ones Don't push it back
[43:12.73]I've just rolled this dude.
[43:14.33]I just rolled that guy.
[43:15.53]Unbelievable.
[43:17.81]I just like necked myself.
[43:19.59]I just like landed on my neck.
[43:25.50]How did I land?
[43:26.88]How did I just get necked?
[43:29.36]I just landed on my neck.
[43:37.62]I'm trying.
[43:41.84]Come on, we have an opportunity in 15 seconds.
[43:43.66]Here it is!
[43:44.06]Dude, why the fuck are we always at zero points?
[43:50.79]We have six fucking points?!
[43:56.81]I'm not done.
[44:07.99]Yellow always loses.
[44:10.05]This is like one of those things where somebody did the math a decade and a half ago and it was the alliance had a slight advantage on the lumber mill battlegrounds map.
[44:27.34]What's it called?
[44:28.48]The one with the capture the flag.
[44:35.40]It's a very old WoW reference.
[44:40.35]Not Arathi, no.
[44:43.41]Warsong Gulch, there it is, yeah.
[44:46.33]I think the Alliance had a tiny, actually really documented slight advantage on that map.
[44:56.17]Is that yellow in this game for that exact game mode?
[45:03.87]It was Horde.
[45:13.41]What was the actual problem, though?
[45:14.61]What was the issue?
[45:17.61]Bow is lame, and if you play it, you probably smell.
[45:23.07]Well, I guess 13 million people smell.
[45:25.53]That's probably accurate.
[45:28.71]It's probably way more than that.
[45:30.65]There's probably like 500 million people that smell right now in the world.
[45:34.91]So, get what I said.
[45:50.84]Oh no, I jumped at the wrong time, but it's okay.
[45:52.74]Look at all that extra weight.
[45:53.64]This guy knows.
[46:01.65]Yeah.
[46:02.65]Notice that guy turned around?
[46:05.23]He turned around.
[46:06.25]He went right away.
[46:08.56]He's trying to keep me as the worst player on Twitch.
[46:12.92]Mine too can play that game, dude.
[46:14.26]See?
[46:16.02]I did that.
[46:16.50]Wait, it was this guy.
[46:17.14]No, it wasn't.
[46:18.00]I can't tell.
[46:18.44]Everyone's the same.
[46:35.37]No.
[46:39.95]It's just about being in 40th place.
[46:44.71]And then eventually you get to first place.
[46:49.91]Haven't you guys ever read that book?
[46:53.29]The Fast Rabbit and the Slow Hare.
[46:55.54]Haven't you guys ever read that book?
[47:00.02]Fast Jerma and Purple Alien.
[47:02.90]They talk about that.
[47:13.02]Why?
[47:13.30]Okay, I feel like a lot of people are having a ton of problems right now.
[47:16.52]Why is this one so crappy?
[47:18.60]Are we just getting fucked with?
[47:19.94]What's going on?
[47:33.31]Oh, I'm the only one weighing this one down.
[47:34.97]Oh, come on.
[47:44.67]I'm not going to qualify.
[47:45.59]This guy!
[47:48.81]This guy!
[47:49.79]No!
[47:57.22]I got like grabbed and dumped off the A. Or, no, I'm not the worst ball guy streamer.
[48:08.09]No.
[48:12.73]This seems fun if you don't win.
[48:14.30]Yeah, it's because going in a jumpy house is fun if you- it doesn't matter.
[48:22.75]Okay, if you go in a jumpy house and you're the first person to go in the jumpy house and the first person to leave the jumpy house, you don't go in and go, I won.
[48:30.43]When was the last time you heard somebody open up the doors of a jumpy house, come out and go: I won!
[48:45.33]Was like a- was there a brawl in there?
[48:47.03]Like all the other people in there like unconscious like beat up?
[49:10.44]Hmm.
[49:15.70]Have a bounce.
[49:16.26]Yeah, you know what?
[49:17.28]Somebody said bouncy house rumble.
[49:18.82]This should just be a match at like the next live rumble.
[49:21.84]Where it's in a jumpy house.
[49:23.16]And like the shit just gets like popped.
[49:28.77]That's like collapsing on him.
[49:41.11]Spoilers?
[49:41.77]Don't worry.
[49:54.25]You had the same idea that I did.
[49:57.73]Second place, lock it in.
[49:58.65]We'll put it in the Jerm Olympics.
[50:04.01]Yeah, for those of you that maybe didn't miss, didn't catch the stream when we talked about this, but we're talking about having a Jerma Olympics where I just get a bunch of like, just like shit-faced friends and we like do like random dumb Olympic events.
[50:28.55]Like, balance the egg on your head.
[50:30.79]Like, okay, who's gonna get the gold medal for that one?
[50:37.69]Like, shot put.
[50:41.96]Floor exercise, that was another one.
[50:43.62]We're gonna do floor exercise.
[50:45.74]Synchronized swimming.
[50:51.02]No, that's not an Olympic event.
[50:53.43]Balance egg on your head is not.
[51:08.97]Synchronized sleeping.
[51:13.37]Synchronized sleeping.
[51:15.81]Everyone just turns off their lights at the same time.
[51:18.39]How would you win?
[51:20.26]Isn't the group that sleeps the longest?
[51:36.33]Two people in a sleeping competition.
[51:37.89]They're under the covers and they're just lying there and there's a timer.
[51:41.50]And what the people don't know is that they're both dead.
[51:47.08]Like seven days go by and it's like, wow, this is the most unbelievable match we've ever seen.
[51:54.19]And both of them are dead.
[51:55.99]They both died.
[52:02.27]Keep cutting back to it.
[52:03.19]It's been like 12 days.
[52:14.55]What are you doing?
[52:15.31]I don't know.
[52:16.13]I wasn't even looking.
[52:18.71]I wasn't looking and we're winning.
[52:20.98]That should tell you something.
[52:27.44]Imagine being that guy and being that good.
[52:30.96]Probably streaming the game right now.
[52:32.37]I wouldn't be surprised.
[52:33.11]That's probably a streamer.
[52:35.17]God damn it.
[52:35.95]I gotta... Why do I have to... How many people in here are streamers?
[52:50.53]Leave it.
[52:50.79]Leave it.
[52:51.03]Just defend these ones.
[52:53.39]Red's in trouble.
[53:04.23]No.
[53:04.69]Yes.
[53:05.99]I bet you... I wonder what your stream is.
[53:08.04]It's probably fucking awesome.
[53:18.79]No, no, no, overtime.
[53:19.71]What do you mean overtime?
[53:28.16]Get it to double overtime.
[53:29.00]No, get it to this way, this way.
[53:30.52]Double overtime, double overtime, double overtime, double overtime.
[53:46.42]Yellow just loses every game on that.
[53:48.66]I think actually Yellow loses every time.
[54:02.03]He just stood around.
[54:08.09]Wait.
[54:09.39]What?
[54:14.21]Am I in this?
[54:18.63]No, that's not me.
[54:19.33]I'm not in this.
[54:32.14]If I had to choose villain red, hero blue, and piss yellow, I'd choose anything but yellow.
[54:38.27]Um, I'm sorry.
[54:39.29]Rage red, blueberry popsicle blue, and mustard yellow.
[54:55.98]You got your colors mixed up there.
[55:03.03]Point still stands.
[55:03.99]Mustard sucks.
[55:06.81]Mustard does not suck.
[55:12.15]I'm seeing trues here.
[55:13.35]I'm seeing a lot of trues.
[55:14.46]That bothers me more than it should.
[55:18.08]Mustard?
[55:18.52]You guys don't like mustard?
[55:19.36]Why?
[55:20.32]What's wrong with it?
[55:31.73]It's like tangy.
[55:32.59]It's a little sour.
[55:33.47]It's kind of spicy.
[55:34.54]It hits you in the back of the throat You use just actually like mustard powder like you make like your own they make it like a hot mustard Hot mustard is incredible
[56:04.76]Do the mustard Andy.
[56:12.46]It's great that saying that you like something makes it your entire identity, apparently.
[56:18.64]Man, I actually really like mustard.
[56:22.74]Mustard Martin.
[56:28.61]You know, I got the PS3 the other day.
[56:30.37]PS3 fanboy.
[56:33.59]No, I kind of, whatever.
[56:35.07]Yeah, my washing machine works pretty well.
[56:41.44]It's a Whirlpool.
[56:42.26]Whirlpool Walrus.
[56:46.99]Okay.
[57:06.91]Oh, this one sucks.
[57:07.83]This is the worst one.
[57:12.34]You cracked the code.
[57:21.40]Those streamers can do it very well.
[57:23.56]Not us.
[57:25.10]We're in the bottom 5,000.
[57:39.03]Ooh, don't get hit by the next one.
[57:40.15]Don't get hit by the next one.
[57:53.92]Wait, you gotta wait, you gotta wait.
[58:49.54]Nooooooo!
[58:53.54]It's time for bed, Jeremy.
[58:56.18]No!
[58:58.53]Don't you fucking walrus-Andy me, I swear to God.
[59:01.51]Get off of me.
[59:02.63]Get off of me!
[59:03.13]Don't touch me.
[59:05.87]Don't touch me.
[59:14.26]Coward!
[59:33.12]Is this it?
[59:33.48]Are we at the end?
[59:33.98]Alright, we gotta be careful.
[59:42.49]We gotta be careful of Coward Andy.
[59:45.21]Why am I using Andy?
[59:46.49]Like, it's a thing I say.
[60:03.93]Oh, this one sucks.
[60:04.75]There's not very many people on this one.
[60:06.17]Alright.
[60:06.57]The deal is just let everybody lose and go.
[60:09.13]You guys want to see something crazy?
[60:18.68]Not that.
[60:33.11]Nobody knows what to do.
[60:47.59]We made it to the final seven.
[60:48.67]I'm ready.
[60:51.17]Okay.
[60:59.47]Come on.
[61:02.64]If it's the tail one, I got it in the bag.
[61:05.59]If it's not the tail one, I don't know.
[61:08.13]It's this one.
[61:08.89]Oh, no.
[61:09.63]Okay, I'm gonna be quiet for this.
[61:11.29]I gotta win my first fall guy.
[61:16.61]Okay.
[61:33.20]Hey dick like leave me alone Why is there maybe such a dick Oh
[62:26.38]this fucking thing.
[62:27.10]Damn it.
[62:58.62]I LOOKED- WHY DID I LOOK AT- I looked at chat!
[63:11.16]I don't know why!
[63:12.06]I was just like, what do they say now?
[63:14.80]Why?
[63:16.70]Why?
[63:17.60]Why?
[63:17.96]That one's so fucking- No!
[63:24.04]This game is just a carrot on a stick!
[63:26.56]Nobody wins this!
[63:28.87]I'm just going to go to the store and I'm going to get some lottery tickets and I'm just going to scratch them.
[63:34.40]I'm not going to win those either.
[63:39.12]But I'm going to know.
[63:40.32]I'm going to read on the news about the guy that won $50,000 from the scratch tickets.
[63:47.31]Oh, that means I can do it.
[63:55.98]Shit.
[63:56.60]I thought I could...
[63:58.67]It just takes like a lock-in concentration and that- I can't do that.
[64:02.47]It's impossible.
[64:05.27]I don't know why I glanced over with my- if you had- if I had a camera on you would have seen like my eyes just fucking glance over.
[64:25.42]You made me waste $20 opening TF2 crates.
[64:28.60]What?
[64:29.66]Now?
[64:31.21]Are you sure I did that?
[64:41.33]What does that have to do with me?
[64:49.22]I can't believe I looked.
[65:10.04]I need to have three crowns that I never spend and I just have.
[65:12.84]But I need to get one legitimately.
[65:18.41]One was given for free.
[65:20.09]One was... No, get this guy!
[65:33.87]Get him!
[65:34.83]Get this guy!
[65:35.41]Get this guy!
[65:36.84]What am I doing?
[65:37.48]Complete it.
[65:45.17]That guy was waiting at the ledge and pushing people off.
[65:47.73]Get him.
[66:01.88]I'm just going to continue to scratch tickets.
[66:10.87]This is worse than that.
[66:12.69]This is like getting a scratch ticket and scratching it, and you don't win any money, but one of the spaces that you scratch off says, turn this in to get the next layer of scratch ticket.
[66:24.98]There's an even higher chance that you could win.
[66:26.66]I have to just keep going back into the convenience store.
[66:31.05]I'm just trading back and forth until I do that seven times, six times.
[66:39.88]And then this one I might win money.
[66:47.12]But the ticket is free.
[66:48.10]No, the ticket was not free.
[66:59.57]BR lottery tickets.
[67:03.53]That would be... What a mess.
[67:05.05]Alright, I'm locking in.
[67:08.30]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[67:20.11]Not a bad idea.
[67:20.69]This guy gets it.
[68:05.01]Your friend just messed you up.
[68:07.04]Bad.
[68:07.38]Treadmill strat.
[68:16.50]Stay on it.
[68:31.37]Bone shield.
[68:43.06]Give me that shit back.
[68:44.62]Get out of here.
[68:54.47]Hey!
[68:59.95]AHH!
[69:06.12]I'm sorry.
[69:06.60]This is a game that makes me scream and I don't... I hate that.
[69:08.90]I'm sorry.
[69:09.32]I'm screaming.
[69:19.62]I need to put a muzzle on when I play these games.
[69:26.97]You have more viewers now than with Riddick.
[69:29.83]That's alright.
[69:32.55]I mean, that's not that surprising to me considering that this game is incredibly popular right now on Twitch and with a bunch of people and has like a million concurrent players and the Chronicles of Riddick Butcher's Bay came out in 2004 and I think four of you played it.
[69:50.93]That doesn't surprise me necessarily.
[69:58.33]It was still... I liked it.
[69:59.35]I thought it was good.
[70:00.39]I thought it was fun.
[70:00.95]It was worth playing.
[70:01.56]I'll put it that way.
[70:02.28]Alright, this is the one.
[70:05.64]Win or lose.
[70:08.82]Win or lose, that's it.
[70:18.00]Too many people.
[70:26.58]Did they have an Aquaman shirt on?
[70:27.70]That was pretty cool.
[70:29.06]I don't know what happened there.
[70:41.07]What's going on?
[71:09.45]I can't keep getting lottery tickets.
[71:11.17]I don't want any more lottery tickets.
[71:12.94]My trunk is full of them.
[71:14.70]They're just crumpled up.
[71:16.28]None of them are winners.
[71:19.90]They all say great job on them.
[71:36.79]You gotta get the expensive ones.
[71:42.04]This is it.
[71:42.64]This is actually the last one.
[71:43.99]I'm not doing another one after this.
[71:45.33]I'm leaving.
[71:45.99]I'm done.
[71:46.47]You won't see me until Sunday.
[71:49.17]Alright?
[71:49.73]That's it.
[71:50.27]This is it.
[71:51.22]And I'm gonna win.
[72:12.71]Quitting Jerry.
[72:13.61]That's not even... That one doesn't work.
[72:24.09]Quitting Quincy.
[72:25.43]Quitting Quincy.
[72:38.16]Quitting Quentin.
[72:39.10]I actually kind of like Quitting Jerry more.
[72:55.16]Quitting Quintin Tarantino.
[72:58.10]What?
[72:59.41]Quitting Quint... Quinting Tarantino.
[73:18.22]Alright.
[73:19.44]Alright, I've had enough.
[73:29.13]Quincy, Massachusetts.
[73:31.99]Yes, that is a place.
[73:52.86]Oh, that's my big break right there!
[73:54.76]No!
[74:01.99]That thing just fucking came out of nowhere.
[74:03.79]Quit Fisto.
[74:22.82]What happened to the mic?
[74:30.54]What's wrong with it?
[74:34.62]Should be fine.
[74:35.42]It should sound good right now.
[74:37.26]Because I'm leaning back in my chair.
[74:44.70]Maybe if I have a different voice the whole time, it'll be better.
[74:47.63]Okay, how about this?
[74:49.67]Ready?
[74:52.95]I'm just going to keep this on.
[74:55.81]Just right here.
[74:57.89]I'm going to pretend like it's not on.
[75:02.93]I'm just going to pitch shift myself down 20-30%.
[75:06.17]Okay.
[75:06.33]Here we go.
[75:21.16]Mute.
[75:22.04]Muted.
[75:22.52]I'm not muted.
[75:27.82]I'm going to prove that I'm not muted.
[75:29.32]Are you ready?
[75:41.56]okay told you just say that any of the things that chat will just go nuts over I'm gonna lose I'm gonna lose I'm gonna rip the ethernet cable out
[76:10.60]I'm focusing on this one.
[76:11.58]I'm putting my headphones in and I'm putting on fucking... I'm putting on, like, music.
[76:14.92]I'm putting on some fucking music.
[76:23.81]No, not Doom.
[76:24.81]It's gotta be something... Like, I'm... Like, Katy Perry Firework is what I'm thinking.
[76:33.13]But I can't play that.
[76:34.65]But that same vibe.
[76:40.72]Okay, is there any royalty-free like Katy Perry like firework music?
[76:44.94]It's a MIDI version?
[77:10.59]Can I actually play a MIDI version?
[77:12.63]I haven't heard that in a long time.
[77:18.84]Can you do that?
[77:43.72]Lawsuit Larry.
[77:49.58]Wait, can I not play a MIDI version of the song?
[77:59.53]Can I play- wait, can I play a lawsuit version of a song?
[78:05.35]Oh, I admit it.
[78:06.29]Can I play him?
[78:09.57]Shine the bright.
[78:11.77]Just open minds.
[78:15.57]Just open minds.
[78:19.28]Like the 4th of July.
[78:22.28]Cause maybe you're a firework.
[78:25.48]Maybe I'm showing.
[78:28.50]Ow!
[78:34.33]humans can't do that computers can sorry guys I hate to break it to you that was a cover of katy perry firework okay that I'm covering that song
[79:06.01]Am I- did I qualify?
[79:23.46]It was too close to the original, I'm gonna get flagged.
[79:30.79]What do you- what do you mean?
[79:37.71]Too close to the original.
[79:38.57]If you put that next to the original song, I bet you it was so bad that it probably wasn't even, like, 16% accurate.
[79:50.36]So, I don't know if I agree with that.
[79:51.50]Like, you could run that through the fucking, like, lawsuit computer, and it'd be like, oh, no, then let's hear what the sound song's like and what the singer song's like.
[80:07.71]Okay, that's what Katy Perry sounds like.
[80:09.98]What does Jerma985 sound like?
[80:12.70]Oh, this is fucking awful.
[80:13.92]This is not even close.
[80:15.90]He might even be singing a different song.
[80:17.42]He sucks so bad at this.
[80:20.54]No, no, no.
[80:21.04]Lawsuit dropped.
[80:28.12]What team am I on?
[80:29.32]Blue?
[80:29.44]Blue?
[80:41.54]Don't take it from me!
[80:42.14]That's mine!
[80:42.66]At least I got it.
[80:43.96]That's all that matters.
[81:01.51]Oh, the DMT is kicking in.
[81:03.07]No, not again.
[81:03.71]For impromptu Katy Perry trying to do that note...
[81:10.31]How was that?
[81:11.23]Out of 10.
[81:13.91]I need to know.
[81:21.91]Like a 4?
[81:26.11]What happens when it's all 4?
[81:31.31]Overtime.
[81:36.56]Literally 4 out of 10.
[81:39.50]Maybe something like that.
[81:42.34]I wasn't paying attention.
[81:43.99]We still won though, right?
[81:46.07]Why is it overtime again?
[81:46.85]Why are we getting overtime again?
[81:56.57]Maybe you're a firework.
[82:15.41]If I had some practice, I think I probably could do it.
[82:18.88]If I sat in the mirror for like two weeks and did it, I could probably come really close.
[82:30.55]Oh, that's... That's not... This has been on the whole time.
[82:38.55]I sang with this on, didn't I?
[82:45.77]I had this on.
[82:47.39]I sang with that on.
[82:49.43]I had a pitch shift down.
[82:52.92]It was pitched down.
[83:02.11]It wasn't.
[83:02.55]It had to be.
[83:08.11]It was never on.
[83:09.55]The DFX light was on.
[83:11.21]It had to be on.
[83:11.83]I need to pay attention.
[83:12.93]Hold on.
[83:24.72]Fools.
[83:25.51]You went at the wrong time.
[83:26.25]I couldn't go.
[83:48.28]I was gonna get pushed off if I had gone.
[83:53.27]If I had gone when the first pass, I would have got hit by the thing and knocked into you guys.
[83:56.65]I would have laughed anyways.
[83:57.69]Hold on, I want to hear this.
[84:19.80]Don't take it from me.
[84:21.49]This is not the... It was pitch shifted down.
[84:26.82]Don't take it from me.
[84:31.46]Firework lawyer version.
[84:38.83]Can I play?
[84:39.49]It is pitch shifted down.
[84:46.12]A tiny bit.
[84:48.10]That's pretty good.
[84:51.82]That's what people were saying.
[84:54.88]What's wrong with your mic?
[85:17.06]Because it sounded like weird and a little lower and shitty.
[85:21.12]Now I get it.
[85:36.69]The 4th of July part was good.
[85:38.79]But then the firework was like... I hit that... When you push the horn too hard... And it goes like... You don't want to push the horn too hard.
[85:49.50]Just enough.
[85:50.46]Not over put.
[85:51.46]Don't over squeeze the horn.
[86:08.22]I can't even see the chat right now.
[86:11.57]Now I can.
[86:22.07]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[86:23.51]Weigh us down.
[86:24.21]He's ignoring us?
[86:27.45]Now I can see you.
[86:29.14]Guys.
[86:32.32]Guys, why did I even jump over?
[86:33.84]I should have just followed the crowd.
[86:59.22]Stop.
[86:59.52]It's been six hours.
[87:00.46]I'm okay.
[87:01.92]Don't worry.
[87:02.56]I'm good.
[87:03.32]When I need to stop, I will stop.
[87:04.78]I promise.
[87:09.11]This is probably going to be the last one.
[87:25.94]You keep saying that.
[87:26.64]Yeah, I know, but this one really will be the final one.
[87:34.67]If it's the tail one, then I'm just gonna leave.
[87:57.65]I hate this one.
[87:58.39]I always... I either do very well or very, very poorly on this one.
[88:04.58]Alright.
[88:04.90]Focus.
[88:14.23]Oh.
[88:14.35]Every single person got hit.
[88:15.23]It's okay.
[88:28.10]React to that one.
[88:52.97]It's gonna be me!
[88:54.29]16, 17, I made it!
[88:56.47]ENQ, you're gonna have to write that another time.
[89:09.52]It's gonna be me.
[89:22.47]It's gonna be... No.
[89:26.77]Thought about it.
[89:29.59]Woop.
[89:29.97]Woosh.
[89:51.05]Oh, yeah?
[89:52.33]Run that back and replay that.
[89:53.59]I went through that.
[89:57.29]That was a blue point.
[90:06.01]Sorry, I just almost blew it for you.
[90:11.23]Call the umpire.
[90:18.61]And this one right here.
[90:22.77]What?
[90:22.97]Something's wrong with my computer.
[90:26.85]Something's wrong with my computer.
[90:40.84]Just go.
[90:41.18]I'll get him.
[90:44.68]Good defense.
[90:45.40]Yeah.
[90:45.56]Something's wrong with my computer.
[90:48.63]Come on.
[90:48.95]One's going to pop up right here.
[91:02.32]Nobody watch that.
[91:02.96]Nobody watch.
[91:15.06]I take responsibility.
[91:21.60]Get it.
[91:21.86]Just get it, dude.
[91:22.50]Come on.
[91:22.86]I'll high five you on your way down.
[91:44.85]I didn't get carried that hard.
[91:56.52]This is the end, right?
[91:58.06]Final round?
[91:58.52]Or is there one more?
[92:15.20]okay I'm gonna go for I'm gonna go for it I'm gonna go for the psycho move everyone's gonna panic at the beginning and not know where to go first I'm just gonna go
[92:54.72]No, we don't go down.
[92:55.58]What?
[92:57.84]How did he know that?
[92:59.58]Did he just guess?
[93:15.31]Hacking Henry.
[93:20.39]Okay, top seven.
[93:22.47]Give me, I got, alright.
[93:24.50]I need something, I need music or something.
[94:25.53]Music's not even fucking good.
[94:27.03]I just like it.
[94:30.87]Yeah, but what am I gonna do the last like 10 seconds?
[94:32.57]I'm gonna lose The beach ball at the concert went way too hard way too hard.
[94:40.16]Oh
[94:54.45]Damn it.
[94:56.17]Oh, I'm never going to win one on my own.
[94:58.13]I only won one with internet.
[95:02.34]Good.
[95:02.98]I have fiber.
[95:03.60]Alright.
[95:05.12]I'll see you later.
[95:06.08]I can't.
[95:06.46]I got to go.
[95:06.90]I want to get some lunch.
[95:10.00]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[95:17.23]Take care, guys.
[95:18.31]Let's run the credits.
[95:22.40]I really thought I was going to be able to win one tonight.
[95:24.88]Even though I only played it for like an hour and 20 minutes.
[95:26.53]Damn.
[95:31.89]Well, we'll see you later.
[95:34.37]This is not how the music is supposed to be right now.
[95:44.87]I assure you.
[95:53.95]What are we going to do on Sunday?
[95:55.91]That's a good question.
[95:59.33]Probably... I might... I don't know.
[96:04.61]There's a bunch of GameCube stuff that I want to do.
[96:06.44]I don't know.
[96:11.08]I still have... Custom Robo is one that I really wanted to play.
[96:18.46]Finish Saw, Super Monkey Ball.
[96:20.26]Yeah, but I'm going to wait for Saw 2.
[96:24.10]Wait for Saw 2.
[96:28.00]Custom Robo should be a lot of fun.
[96:29.57]Pikmin, I want to do that at some point too.
[96:33.97]But I do want to say thank you to Jerma.
[96:36.55]Okay, I just freaked out for a second.
[96:37.77]I saw Jerma985 gave 50 community subs and I forgot that I did that because we played a completely different game.
[96:44.47]And I said, I was about to say my account may have just got compromised.
[96:50.42]But I remember now.
[96:51.30]That was like two and a half hours ago.
[96:52.80]Three hours ago.
[96:55.24]Jetsnake gave $100.
[96:55.92]Thank you, Jetsnake, for the $100.
[96:58.39]And then James Morris gave 20 community subs.
[97:03.13]I wanted to say thanks.
[97:04.45]We also had a raid come in, too.
[97:05.73]Tyler McVicker.
[97:06.51]I missed earlier.
[97:08.49]Thanks for the raid.
[97:09.07]Appreciate it.
[97:11.25]If you guys stick around, thanks a lot.
[97:16.18]Let's see what the credits look like.
[97:19.99]Thanks to anybody that subs this channel.
[97:23.48]You are under no obligation, but I appreciate it nonetheless.
[97:28.92]And here are all of you that subbed today.
[97:35.36]Thanks a lot.
[97:36.04]He's doing the streamer voice.
[97:37.15]Yeah, I gotta pull it out sometimes.
[97:38.57]Play Pikmin on Sunday.
[97:47.63]Um...
[97:50.58]I don't know if I'm gonna... I don't think I'm gonna play Pikmin on Sunday.
[97:55.03]I'll tell you why I don't think I'm gonna play Pikmin on Sunday, because I don't have Pikmin on Sunday.
[98:00.37]I don't own it.
[98:02.13]Did I buy it before I went on break?
[98:03.71]Is it back here?
[98:07.16]Maybe I did.
[98:07.94]No, I don't think I did.
[98:12.32]What about Half-Life Alyx?
[98:16.82]VR is going to come back once I'm comfortable here and once I'm really, like, feeling like I'm ready to go and I feel better.
[98:27.43]And I can comfortably be in a VR headset for more than three hours or so.
[98:32.41]I want to do Half-Life Alyx.
[98:34.29]I want to do Boneworks.
[98:36.49]I want to do... There's like 10 new VR games that came out over the last six months.
[98:41.19]And some stuff that I didn't even do.
[98:42.47]I didn't even finish.
[98:46.95]I want to do Tilt Brush for a little while.
[98:48.63]I did it for like 10 minutes one time.
[98:51.75]Oh, this flipper had an HDTV.
[98:54.99]There's a lot to do.
[98:55.65]Yeah, there's a ton of stuff to do.
[98:56.74]So expect VR stuff soon.
[99:04.10]I also want to bring this up too because this is important.
[99:06.90]I brought this up in pre-stream chat, but I want to kind of make people aware of it now.
[99:12.17]As of today or last night,
[99:16.58]This work has been started on a choose-your-own-adventure custom-made game board that we are going to play on stream.
[99:29.33]Completely inspired by sorcery.
[99:31.19]There's going to be a ton of things to do, tons of choices.
[99:39.22]Trying to involve people that know kind of about that space and know how to use it and do things like that.
[99:43.82]There's a couple of really good art... That's all, folks.
[99:49.76]A couple of really good artists are going to be making the artwork for it.
[99:54.10]You know... I think you probably know both of them, I would assume.
[99:56.81]You know, Ashley is going to be making artwork for it.
[100:00.11]And John Silva.
[100:02.49]Star is going to be the head game, essentially, maker.
[100:07.37]Or the board maker, map maker.
[100:12.20]It should be a lot of fun.
[100:13.46]It's gonna be completely custom-made, just a sorcery-like choose-your-own-adventure game.
[100:22.97]I'm also gonna hit up some people about it.
[100:24.69]I want to talk to Arcadum about it, because he knows a ton about this shit.
[100:33.23]Get a bunch of input from him, because he obviously knows a lot about games like this.
[100:44.42]But my point is that you may hear about people working on this project, and I want you to hear it from the horse's mouth.
[100:54.30]So you might see, for instance, if Star is talking about it, or if John Silva is talking about it, then I want you to be like, wait, hold on, what are you talking about?
[101:03.39]So it's a real thing as of yesterday.
[101:11.72]That's the scariest way to hear anything.
[101:16.89]General ETA before November.
[101:19.45]That's kind of what we've decided.
[101:22.62]Star is going to be doing a ton of encounter making and we're going to sit down on a few calls and go over what I really want to see.
[101:32.14]And obviously he has a bunch of great ideas like everybody else does, right?
[101:36.52]But I want it to be a kind of a blind experience that you guys get to make choices too.
[101:43.14]So imagine sorcery, but it's completely custom made around sort of this community.
[101:51.96]And you guys will be able to participate by voting on what paths we can go down sometimes.
[101:58.68]So before November of this year is when it's supposed to happen.
[102:09.08]I'll give you more updates when they come.
[102:12.37]It should be a lot of fun.
[102:13.11]It's official as of yesterday.
[102:22.45]What's on Sunday?
[102:24.29]I'll have to figure that out over the next few days.
[102:26.82]There are a ton of options, so...
[102:32.24]October 31st, then.
[102:34.18]Well, maybe.
[102:36.06]It could be... I don't know.
[102:37.80]We can't give a date, but Star thinks that this could all be ready at some point, either before November or just barely into November.
[102:50.08]I'll figure it out, though.
[102:53.39]But I am gonna go... I'm gonna run.
[102:55.57]I'm gonna run away because I need to eat food.
[102:59.47]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[103:00.35]We'll figure out what we're gonna do.
[103:01.56]Thanks for watching.
[103:04.82]Take care of yourselves.
[103:05.50]Have a great night.
[103:08.00]Have a great start to your weekend.
[103:09.58]I'll see you at the end of it.
[103:12.98]And goodbye.
[103:45.63]Thank you.
