[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.33]Hi guys.
[00:04.23]Welcome back.
[00:07.29]It's me, Jeremy.
[00:13.43]That's hair in my mouth.
[00:18.77]I just took a big almost sip of my- I took an almost big sip of my coffee with just three or four hairs on the top of my tongue.
[00:27.91]Good afternoon.
[00:30.69]Starting about an hour or two early today again.
[00:34.39]For the sake of Sekiro, I'm gonna continue.
[00:38.25]If you just got a notification and you just came over here and- Oh my- Wait, J- Jeremy's streaming right now?
[00:43.13]Oh, I sure am.
[00:44.34]I sure admit Sekiro though, so you might- Oh, fuck, get me out of here!
[00:47.98]If you don't want to be spoiled, we are about eight hours into the game.
[00:54.06]Just want to make sure you're aware of that, so I don't press the button here and switch over, and you go, I just saw a huge spoiler.
[01:10.01]We are also going to go into sub only again for today.
[01:16.18]We did it with Dark Souls 3, and I think it's just warranted for a game like this.
[01:23.42]It keeps the spoilers and the potential spam of said spoilers at bay.
[01:36.20]I don't do it that often, but like I said, for games like this, it's something that I do.
[01:49.29]Sub only greedy streamer.
[01:52.12]The greed is taking him over.
[01:55.98]He's going to force us to pay money to speak.
[02:00.44]What's next?
[02:09.18]I want to watch you so bad, but I want to start playing.
[02:13.78]Well, the beauty of where you are right now is this is recorded.
[02:18.15]So if you really don't want to watch
[02:22.34]Let me play.
[02:23.84]You're really torn.
[02:24.57]You could play, and then you could just see how I do, you know?
[02:28.42]Or vice versa.
[02:31.69]You know, there's no obligation to watch.
[02:33.47]But remember, this is forever on the internet.
[02:36.49]Everything that I'm doing right now, no matter what, everything I'm saying is recorded forever.
[02:41.70]That's why I gotta be careful.
[02:43.40]You know, I gotta make sure I stay completely sane.
[02:46.38]I don't do anything weird.
[02:47.16]Don't say anything weird.
[02:48.46]Because that was permanently, this sentence I'm saying right now, permanently recorded forever.
[02:55.98]There's no going back and deleting.
[02:56.95]This is already here.
[02:58.19]Every single second forever recorded.
[03:03.40]Everything here.
[03:08.88]So I gotta be ready.
[03:14.83]No pressure.
[03:18.73]I actually am still sick, too.
[03:20.79]Just... It's been annoying.
[03:23.39]I'll be alright, though.
[03:24.39]I went eight hours yesterday.
[03:25.45]We'll see how we do today.
[03:28.11]With that being said, I think we can get off of the starting soon screen.
[03:33.58]I'm just sitting here in the inventory.
[03:35.58]And let's get that audio on, too.
[03:42.86]I really want to watch the stream, but I don't want the game to be spoiled.
[03:46.27]No, and I completely understand that.
[03:50.35]Well, hey, what you could do is... Here, I have a solution.
[03:54.75]You ready?
[03:55.95]Here's the solution.
[03:58.13]Go down to the quality settings that are on the bottom of your window here.
[04:03.77]Click on the little cog wheel.
[04:06.37]Make it like 360p, or like 160p, cell phone quality.
[04:13.27]Turn the screen brightness down on your monitor to about 10%.
[04:20.02]Once that's done, have a system make a script on your computer that auto-mutes the audio coming from the stream.
[04:30.86]every 10 seconds, and it stays muted for 15 seconds.
[04:35.26]So you'll get snippets of me talking.
[04:38.64]It won't spoil anything, because, like, what the hell could I be talking about?
[04:41.28]Have the audio just randomly cut off every 10 seconds for, like, 30 seconds.
[04:47.66]And at the same time, be working on something.
[04:50.44]Have, like, your other monitor or have, like, another device in your hand, like playing a game monitor or something, so you're not really paying that much attention.
[04:56.79]That's how you can do it.
[05:01.53]Or just play it on your own time and enjoy it.
[05:04.75]Because it's meant to be enjoyed.
[05:07.61]And speaking of things that are meant to be done.
[05:12.80]Also, write a script to donate big bits.
[05:16.06]Yeah, have a script, like, on your computer.
[05:17.48]It's an EXE file.
[05:18.36]You double-click it.
[05:19.38]And every, like, 20 minutes, like, $1,000 is given.
[05:27.70]Don't do that.
[05:28.34]That is absolutely the complete reverse.
[05:32.54]I know, and I had to say $1,000 too, right?
[05:34.73]I couldn't have said $1.
[05:37.97]Speaking of $1, those of you that weren't here yesterday, this is actually pretty funny.
[05:43.01]Somebody, I think it was Tingy that brought this up.
[05:46.76]Tingy, if you're here.
[05:48.77]They were saying that every time I die in Sekiro, because I made like a, I don't know, late last night, I kind of went out of my fucking mind.
[05:54.95]I went insane at one of the bosses and lost control of all of my bodily functions, including my motor speech vehicle.
[06:03.52]So what we decided to be funny is every time I die in Sekiro, tally it up.
[06:10.38]And at the end of the whole thing, whenever I stop playing it, I got to buy scratch ticket for every death.
[06:19.03]or every five deaths is one is like $5 scratch ticket and just scratch them on stream.
[06:25.83]And then whatever happens, whatever money comes from those scratch tickets goes back into the channel for community subs.
[06:38.75]So if I hit like 500 bucks on scratch ticket, $500 worth of community subs.
[06:46.53]Watch you win $20,000.
[06:47.43]Now that would be fucking hilarious.
[06:52.09]Because, what is $20,000?
[06:54.04]I would, there would be almost every single person, every single person on the channel would have a sub, right?
[07:04.04]That would be too many.
[07:04.93]I would, could I legally even do that though?
[07:07.93]I might get in trouble.
[07:08.75]If I do like 20 grand worth of community subs...
[07:13.93]Someone's going to take a look at that and be like, what's going on here?
[07:23.48]Anyways, I'm going to consume this memory to get some more attack power.
[07:25.90]This is the butterfly.
[07:26.60]This is the last boss that I just beat before moving on.
[07:33.89]What are you in for?
[07:35.99]Too many community subs.
[07:38.44]Alright, so the battle memory of an extraordinary foe, although distant, recollection of such a memory provided sustenance for the wolf.
[07:45.98]The phantom lady butterfly was appointed by the wolf's foster father as one of his mentors in shinobi techniques.
[07:52.95]These mentors employed strict methods.
[07:54.69]The cultivation of shinobi techniques can only be achieved in the midst of battle.
[08:00.47]Attack power has been enhanced.
[08:01.77]So I have attack power 3.
[08:03.59]I almost have another skill point, which... I'm looking forward to, because that means I get more... Hold on a second, let me see.
[08:12.58]I was going down this path.
[08:15.82]But I don't... I want this.
[08:20.13]This makes the heal better.
[08:25.79]Cough cough slash slash sounds like a League of Legends pro username.
[08:31.71]Well, somebody get it.
[08:34.33]Somebody get it and then win a tournament and give me 2%.
[08:36.10]That's all I ask.
[08:38.36]Not even, no, 1%.
[08:39.30]That's all I ask.
[08:43.56]Alright, so Emma taught this technique to the sculptor long ago.
[08:47.32]So just increase the healing effects of recovery items.
[08:49.52]I just, like, I need that.
[08:53.31]I want it.
[08:53.71]I'm gonna get it.
[08:56.59]So we were... The last thing we did, we cleared the chamber.
[09:01.11]And that brought us... I think this is where I was before.
[09:03.27]The castle gate, right?
[09:09.98]Freudian, you can't stick around for tonight's stream, but I wanted to drop in and show some support anyhow.
[09:14.36]Have a great night, Freudian.
[09:15.22]Thank you for dropping in.
[09:16.96]And you also get ten bucks, too.
[09:19.25]Have an awesome night.
[09:21.75]Thanks for sticking around.
[09:24.01]Well, thanks for hanging out for the few minutes that you were here.
[09:28.31]You just made me sub, god damn it.
[09:31.91]I'm sorry.
[09:32.65]I don't do sub only.
[09:36.15]It's only sometimes.
[09:40.45]It's for Sekiro.
[09:41.51]Shadows die twice.
[09:44.45]Seems a little loud to me.
[09:47.41]Is it a little loud to anybody else?
[09:53.88]No.
[09:55.06]It's because of the spoilers.
[10:01.39]So where were we?
[10:04.03]This way.
[10:06.89]Let me... I want to look at something first, though, because... Who are these people?
[10:17.17]The man who coughs has witnessed endless battle.
[10:19.17]Let me get my mouse off the screen.
[10:23.82]Okay.
[10:24.88]The sculptor is coughing.
[10:26.12]The maid is coughing.
[10:28.94]The fine son...
[10:31.55]The coughing and wheezing sounds of a man thinking only of his sick mother.
[10:36.25]The man who coughs has witnessed endless battles, making offerings to the dead in the battlefield outside Ashina Castle Gate.
[10:45.57]So there's that guy and his, the mother and the son, right?
[10:49.35]That's gotta remember where these people are.
[10:51.61]Because I don't think I can kill them.
[10:56.83]Oh, now it's too low.
[10:57.57]I'm gonna turn it back up.
[11:02.55]Submode is emote-only mode with words?
[11:07.83]Well, that's just chatting.
[11:13.88]What?
[11:16.28]Alright.
[11:18.08]Let's see here.
[11:18.98]Anybody else?
[11:20.42]Oh, God.
[11:20.92]I don't know how I pulled that off.
[11:26.16]Oh, shit.
[11:26.56]Get me back up here.
[11:27.30]This is not a place I want to be right now.
[11:33.56]Aye yai yai.
[11:35.96]Okay, um... Let's see, where are those dogs?
[11:42.25]I gotta get the dogs first.
[11:44.67]Wow.
[11:50.63]Dog.
[11:53.73]Shit, no, I want the dog.
[11:58.84]Oh no, these are the mushroom people are here too.
[12:04.09]I'm gonna aggro the whole city.
[12:06.84]Oh fu- I gotta get out of here.
[12:09.50]Run away.
[12:11.46]One at a time, please.
[12:12.80]I think I'm gonna die.
[12:17.02]Everyone's fighting me here.
[12:21.13]Something I learned from playing last night and yesterday.
[12:26.25]Not every fight can be won.
[12:28.37]Sometimes you just gotta run the hell away.
[12:31.31]You don't have to fight five people at the same time.
[12:34.17]Let's see if I can pick off the guy that was here.
[12:41.51]Was it two dogs, right?
[12:42.47]Was it three dogs?
[12:47.47]That's a coward's motto.
[12:54.09]That's not a coward's motto.
[12:55.31]That is a strategist's motto.
[13:01.75]Okay, there's another dog.
[13:03.01]Let's just kill this guy.
[13:09.87]Alright.
[13:11.25]How are you?
[13:15.37]That's a very cowardly strategist.
[13:18.78]Well, isn't the goal to live?
[13:21.56]If the goal is living... Isn't that correct?
[13:27.87]If you were that skilled, would you really want to just be able to die that easily?
[13:32.07]No one's Superman.
[13:32.91]Superman isn't real.
[13:36.57]In real life, you can't fight more than one person at the same time.
[13:42.34]Somebody's going to come from behind you with a chair and hit you in the back of the head.
[13:47.72]It's not going to happen.
[13:53.04]This guy's real.
[13:55.67]Oh, great.
[14:00.48]Alright, fuck the guy with the gun.
[14:02.02]Come here.
[14:08.32]Oh, perfect parries.
[14:12.50]Oh, absolutely perfect parries.
[14:21.74]Spoilers for real life.
[14:22.94]Yeah, you can say that.
[14:26.02]Wait, there's something over here.
[14:27.16]Let me see.
[14:29.83]Ooh, a ledge.
[14:34.21]Is this the guy that got good at Sekiro?
[14:35.81]I told you I had to just fucking save my game.
[14:44.64]I didn't get to the... Guys, I didn't get to the level up screen.
[14:48.52]Well, I can go around here.
[14:51.98]I dumped a bunch of experience points into my talent pool.
[14:55.76]And I didn't put the points in.
[14:57.66]I put him in.
[14:58.18]I fell asleep.
[14:58.90]I woke up with those skills.
[15:07.67]Is this the guy who beat Sekiro Shadows Die twice on stream?
[15:10.85]Well, only once.
[15:16.01]Oh, wait.
[15:16.31]I'm going to die if I do that.
[15:31.76]Best part about being sick is you get to do the wicked old man laugh whenever you want.
[15:36.63]I hope somebody clips that.
[15:46.83]I guess I can drop down from this way rather than... Well, let's just kill this guy in one hit.
[15:51.55]Who else is down here?
[15:52.71]Who's important?
[15:55.52]I think I can get him and get out.
[16:03.10]Let's get in, get out.
[16:04.04]And that's how you get in and get out.
[16:09.95]Any questions?
[16:12.43]What?
[16:12.97]Why did I just do that?
[16:15.95]Oh, I can take him.
[16:17.03]I can take him.
[16:17.65]It's just two.
[16:18.05]What are we going to do?
[16:31.23]I've never fought a big guy like this before.
[16:32.59]Just dodging.
[16:41.86]Wow, you have fucking lots of... I forget there's no stamina.
[16:53.34]Oh, fuck.
[17:04.12]Yeah, they can just keep swinging.
[17:05.17]Alright, where are we at?
[17:10.07]Let me go down here.
[17:14.91]Oh, let me just go down here.
[17:19.20]Can you deflect blunt objects?
[17:20.42]I think you can deflect anything.
[17:23.06]But... Dodging... When I have a chance to just dodge, I'm gonna take the chance.
[17:31.49]Just because I'm so much more used to that.
[17:33.87]Let's go this way.
[17:36.49]Anything else in here?
[17:37.23]Around the corner?
[17:39.89]I could have hid over here.
[17:40.71]Nope.
[17:44.92]Alright, well, let's go.
[17:47.88]Only seems to be one way to go.
[17:50.08]Wait, what about down here?
[17:52.76]That's death.
[17:56.41]What about behind the building?
[17:59.27]Aha!
[18:02.61]Clay.
[18:04.79]Are Boston Baked Beans a thing?
[18:06.17]Yeah.
[18:09.07]I think I can actually upgrade one of my tools now, but I don't know if I want to.
[18:14.37]Yeah, parrying is so much better now.
[18:15.91]You have to.
[18:18.15]You can't not parry.
[18:19.32]The whole game is based around you doing that.
[18:21.88]Dodging... If those of you that weren't here yesterday, that had no idea how the game plays...
[18:28.87]Well, first of all, that's five community subs from Kaiser.
[18:34.73]Thank you, Kaiser.
[18:40.43]I can't, my name is, not my name, your name.
[18:49.52]Doesn't discriminate between friend or foe.
[18:52.86]Wait, say that one more time.
[18:56.47]Alright, so wait, I'm assuming there's a boss or a mini-boss that I can have fight a person, right?
[19:10.40]But, um, thank you for the community subs and to keep that kind of question going.
[19:15.90]Yes, this game, I'm one of those people that wasn't very good at parrying in any of the Dark Souls games.
[19:26.03]I relied on dodging and iframes.
[19:28.49]And it's all I did.
[19:30.49]Sometimes I would parry regular enemies or Black Knights.
[19:35.34]You cannot do that anymore.
[19:38.06]There is no dodge every attack.
[19:39.90]You have to learn how to play this game.
[19:43.46]And it can be immensely frustrating.
[19:45.02]That's one of the reasons why everybody's saying this is the hardest one they've ever made.
[19:48.80]It's not the hardest game they've ever made.
[19:50.81]It's the fact that you have to use all the tools they give you when before you didn't have to.
[19:56.53]That's the problem.
[19:58.51]No one's used to doing this.
[20:00.97]You gotta, like, learn how to play this game, not just rely on iframes.
[20:06.62]And it can be immensely frustrating.
[20:09.64]But, it's... What?
[20:21.13]Wait, wait, wait.
[20:22.29]Where the fuck is this coming from?
[20:23.61]What the fuck is that thing?
[20:26.53]Did somebody's dog just get out?
[20:28.73]What the fuck?
[20:31.43]Okay, um... It's just talking about... Speaking of dodging and parrying, let's see if we can do it.
[20:50.88]No, I ain't gonna... There's no verticality here either.
[21:01.62]Are we really gonna use that thing?
[21:05.48]You mean this?
[21:06.60]Yeah.
[21:12.97]Alright, hold on.
[21:15.43]How do you parry a gigantic pig?
[21:24.11]If only I had health.
[21:30.87]Run around.
[21:31.33]There's no stamina!
[21:35.97]Oh boy, I'm dead.
[21:37.49]Okay.
[21:41.11]Um... Let's just die.
[21:50.62]Use the wa- I used it all, I don't have any left.
[21:57.90]Okay.
[21:59.92]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:02.24]I haven't even used this.
[22:12.80]Should I get the, let's see, dowsing powder.
[22:15.30]Burn resistance and resistance to burn damage.
[22:17.24]Help put that on.
[22:19.48]How does this work?
[22:20.02]It costs two to use.
[22:22.75]Okay.
[22:23.33]Explosive flash that briefly blinds foes and inflicts posture damage on beast-type enemies.
[22:27.29]It's got a wide frontward field of effect.
[22:33.42]Scaring beasts.
[22:35.56]Oh, sick.
[22:38.75]Do something funny.
[22:39.55]You got it.
[22:40.31]Hello, my baby.
[22:41.13]Hello, my darling.
[22:42.07]Hello, my ragtime gal.
[22:43.93]Send me a kiss, my mile.
[22:45.87]Baby, my heart's on fire.
[22:47.73]And if you refuse me, baby, you lose me.
[22:49.86]And you'll be left alone.
[22:51.08]And tell me, tell me that I'm the one and all.
[22:55.90]Happy?
[22:56.34]Can we move on?
[22:59.98]Okay.
[23:04.32]That sounds good.
[23:12.59]So, what's the point of fighting these guys?
[23:15.70]Just go over to the giant animal.
[23:19.72]Oh, you asshole.
[23:20.74]Now I have to reset it.
[23:28.20]Do something funny.
[23:30.44]You see, for you keen viewers, that wasn't funny.
[23:37.24]You know, he looks like an idiot.
[23:41.95]It's not me that looks like the idiot.
[23:44.44]He looks like the idiot, right?
[23:50.84]I gotta utilize this laugh while I have it.
[23:57.92]I have skill.
[24:02.16]Don't you show me that face.
[24:08.00]Here we go.
[24:10.36]Let's get it.
[24:13.23]My heal is better.
[24:14.09]It can be even better.
[24:16.57]I'm not gonna save up for that though.
[24:19.99]Don't show me that face.
[24:21.29]I don't want to see that face.
[24:26.74]Let's see how this works.
[24:27.58]Let's see the range on this.
[24:31.06]Okay, it's pretty much right in front of you.
[24:38.32]It's not that far.
[24:40.62]Can I put it like on his ass?
[24:50.77]Does it have to be right in the face?
[24:55.57]Not this time.
[25:06.40]So yeah, it doesn't understand friend or foe.
[25:08.64]So then let's just aggro the whole camp and have him kill everybody.
[25:14.96]What's the harm?
[25:20.94]Is this going to be a mess?
[25:21.94]This could turn into a real mess.
[25:29.36]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop.
[25:32.75]Okay, so here we go.
[25:36.39]Let's bring the whole... Bring everybody.
[25:41.17]Oh, god damn it.
[25:44.11]Oh, my god.
[25:45.01]Well...
[25:50.82]That worked out.
[26:01.19]Scare him!
[26:06.09]Okay, that's pretty effective.
[26:12.83]Oh, he's immune to it now.
[26:14.01]I can only do that once, it seems.
[26:25.70]No?
[26:26.02]Okay, it's only kind of a weird cooldown.
[26:36.27]Oh, this area is not that big to be diving around in.
[26:48.06]Just whittle him down.
[26:49.76]Ow!
[26:49.88]That hit me?
[26:50.36]Come on.
[26:55.56]Jesus oh That was that camera was fucking stupid did you see that camera?
[27:10.24]Who's can't what forget it fuck the camera Fuck the camera, why would I have it on?
[27:19.03]Shit
[27:34.08]He's almost down to half.
[27:47.36]Not bad.
[27:50.42]Let's just try and give it an attempt here.
[27:53.94]Fuck.
[27:56.06]He's got a little half delay on his dash.
[28:00.47]I'm like that.
[28:01.01]I'm fucked.
[28:10.39]That was decent.
[28:15.76]This run back is kind of a pain, though.
[28:18.60]Uh, I wonder.
[28:30.45]No, we'll keep this the way it is.
[28:40.36]Hello.
[28:41.52]Goodbye.
[28:44.30]How's the game so far?
[28:46.00]I think it's great.
[28:47.16]I love it.
[28:50.74]I have like one or two very slight minor issues with the game.
[28:55.51]But I don't even know if I would classify them as a real issue.
[29:01.79]Alright, the problem was last time I just got fucking screwed.
[29:04.39]Alright, stay back.
[29:07.65]This guy's gonna die.
[29:12.05]Alright.
[29:14.78]Oh my god!
[29:15.98]The start of it every time!
[29:31.72]Can I jump him?
[29:34.54]Oh, this motherfucker could get jumped.
[29:37.76]I just have to, like, ole him.
[29:43.09]Alright, now I'm just getting overzealous.
[29:44.43]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[29:45.35]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[29:46.41]Everything's fine.
[29:46.93]You can jump over.
[29:50.43]Come on in.
[30:03.30]Come on in.
[30:13.75]Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[30:14.81]Nothing too crazy.
[30:15.89]Wait for them to come in.
[30:21.33]Boys and girls, that's what we call... D.O.G.
[30:26.09]S.H.I.T.
[30:28.69]That was dog shit.
[30:35.62]I like didn't...
[30:51.04]You can clip on his head and not jump over him when he charges.
[30:54.58]Of course you can.
[30:55.20]That just threw me off.
[31:03.14]I should have jumped over him that time.
[31:04.90]Not the time you just saw, but of course.
[31:06.20]Are they always gonna put that guy... They gotta put this one guy with the gun that will accidentally... He's gonna shoot me once.
[31:20.18]And I'm gonna have to redo the whole thing.
[31:21.72]Run back.
[31:28.55]I beat this boss on first try, so haha.
[31:32.14]I hope you did.
[31:34.42]I bet you didn't though.
[31:36.34]No you didn't, no you didn't, no you didn't, no you didn't.
[31:45.66]Alright.
[31:46.28]Watch out!
[31:48.96]Oh no!
[31:49.70]I wonder what dog is gonna win this.
[31:52.74]How did a dog get in here?
[31:53.74]Oh, I have a bigger dog.
[32:05.85]No, that's not a good idea.
[32:07.01]I'm just gonna dodge.
[32:08.43]That's not reliable at all.
[32:09.73]It really isn't.
[32:32.55]I really should be trying just to run around him.
[32:33.88]Don't let him get in front of you.
[32:43.29]Do the chase!
[32:43.95]I didn't get the frame there.
[32:54.90]Woohoohoo!
[33:07.81]Oh, don't do that to me, man!
[33:12.71]That little spin.
[33:26.13]Alright, come here.
[33:29.19]Nooooo!
[33:34.57]Shit!
[33:34.79]Wrong button!
[33:38.11]Can only do this one more time.
[33:44.73]That was just bad timing.
[33:45.85]Let's use it now.
[33:56.56]Mm-hmm.
[34:17.13]Come on.
[34:26.01]Oh, come on.
[34:30.24]I really enjoy your Katamari cosplay, but come on, dude.
[34:33.94]Let me up.
[34:37.16]He's like wicked aggressive right now.
[34:46.76]Oh, yeah!
[34:51.16]Where am I going?
[34:53.09]He's got a new move!
[34:54.07]He's got a new move!
[34:55.97]I don't even... What a fantastic camera.
[35:03.83]I got him, I got him, I got him.
[35:07.36]No, I'm dead.
[35:08.06]Oh my fucking god.
[35:17.53]I just love having a camera just be like somebody was filming something else.
[35:34.13]The only way that would have been, you would have made that worse.
[35:36.81]It happened.
[35:37.39]It happened by the way.
[35:38.31]Look, it happened.
[35:39.39]It happens.
[35:40.07]Now I have to start over.
[35:46.65]Yeah, the only way that account would have been worse right there with the camera was if it was a vertical fucking video.
[36:07.28]Come on.
[36:10.47]Boom!
[36:11.13]Almost got him.
[36:12.97]Don't worry, I'll try again in like five minutes.
[36:20.83]Okay, FromSoftware, I got an idea for you.
[36:23.39]I have a really good, here's an idea for a next video game that you make.
[36:26.21]Alright, let me coat my weapon.
[36:29.22]And like, let me eat, okay, you have candy in this game.
[36:31.30]Let me take a bite of a candy that lasts five seconds.
[36:34.38]No, not even.
[36:35.18]The next enemy you kill is permanently dead.
[36:38.40]I would use it right there and kill that guy.
[36:42.11]They haven't thought of that.
[36:44.55]The next enemy that you kill with your blade is permanently dead.
[36:47.53]That doesn't respawn.
[36:50.01]That would sell millions.
[36:55.88]I want to try something.
[36:56.64]This is like the idiot run.
[36:58.10]Ready?
[37:02.96]That's not going to happen.
[37:20.34]How much does this do?
[37:21.14]What does this do for my posture?
[37:22.24]I haven't even tried it yet.
[37:27.67]It actually hurts me a lot.
[37:29.89]Nah, that's not a good idea.
[37:30.83]That's a horrible idea.
[37:32.43]That's not going to work.
[37:40.17]Got him in the head.
[37:41.37]The head is where I need to hit him.
[38:01.35]Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
[38:13.35]This was the idiot run, for a reason.
[38:14.89]I wanna see how much damage it takes to hit him in the head before he staggers.
[38:26.70]It makes it even worse because the thing on his head is such a distraction for where he's moving.
[38:36.13]How many hits does it take?
[38:37.25]I can't even tell.
[38:52.58]Upgrade your vitality.
[38:53.76]I already did.
[38:58.30]Try deflecting.
[39:05.35]Why the fuck does this have to be here?
[39:09.69]It's only purpose is to be annoying!
[39:12.99]This could be empty!
[39:14.79]Put a tree here!
[39:16.53]Just put a fucking bush here!
[39:18.51]And it's the same purpose!
[39:20.01]The same thing!
[39:22.03]Just put a fucking statue!
[39:25.11]Right here!
[39:52.19]It worked!
[40:02.84]My potion works!
[40:20.91]I had it that time too.
[40:22.17]I'm just, you know, this happens when you fucking shake.
[40:24.17]This is why you're not allowed to shake pinball machines.
[40:25.89]Because now the fucking machine doesn't work.
[40:38.95]The Pinwheel machine.
[40:41.90]Alright, here we go.
[40:42.74]I'm gonna try a couple of things here.
[40:51.22]Yes, game.
[40:51.72]That's the guy I wanted to lock onto.
[40:52.94]The one dickhead that's still here.
[40:57.06]Yes, that's the person I wanted to lock onto.
[40:59.70]Prioritize the fucking bald guy, game.
[41:02.05]Yeah, do that.
[41:07.07]Give me a break.
[41:26.75]I don't have the thing.
[41:27.94]I was going to try it.
[41:32.20]Why do I have the flame thing on?
[41:33.44]I was going to hit with the axe.
[41:57.43]This fucking camera, come on man, like what the fuck?
[42:13.22]You gotta like, I have to untarget him.
[42:15.36]That thing just spins around in a fucking circle.
[42:27.54]How did this guy get in here?
[42:28.42]I don't think I have any more... No, I'm dead.
[42:36.66]Not yet.
[42:40.77]No, I got nothing.
[42:48.83]Well, I'm gonna try it.
[42:50.05]It's possible.
[42:54.39]No, no it's not.
[43:07.90]This guy's arguably harder than the last person.
[43:10.48]Last person at least had... even remote.
[43:13.94]Don't you dare.
[43:16.47]The butterfly lady.
[43:18.95]I mean, at least you had a second.
[43:23.74]This is just a bull screaming and running in circles.
[43:34.72]You're the one that gets things down around here.
[43:36.51]No, I'm not gonna use that right now.
[43:39.15]This is very beatable, it's just... Did that dog drop on my back?
[43:42.83]Alright, lock it quick!
[43:48.98]Before anybody gets in!
[43:50.76]Shit, somebody got in.
[44:07.60]Oh my god.
[44:11.14]What?
[44:11.70]Oh, I didn't even have- just restarted.
[44:13.76]Man, jeez, you die in fucking one hit too.
[44:17.44]You die in like one or two hits in this game.
[44:20.68]You can't take any hits.
[44:24.37]You can't get hit in Sekiro.
[44:26.19]You can't take damage.
[44:28.13]Fuck!
[44:29.21]Fuck!
[44:37.28]This is the one... I don't know.
[44:43.19]The perfect world has to really happen here.
[44:47.01]Don't aggro in three bald guys that accidentally hit you with a sword that throws off the whole attempt.
[44:54.98]And perfect dodging.
[44:57.12]There's a lot of things that have to go right here.
[45:09.39]Yeah, see?
[45:09.95]And that's what I'm talking about.
[45:11.41]It happened.
[45:14.15]If I didn't turn around, that would have been... I would have screamed.
[45:20.45]Kill these guys, please!
[45:21.55]Ah, you actually hit me with a... Oh, my fucking god.
[45:27.17]Why?
[45:31.73]Why can those guys even come in that fucking room?
[45:36.92]Uhhh...
[45:48.46]Kill them before they come in?
[46:01.54]Just kill everybody.
[46:04.64]Before attempting a boss.
[46:05.78]I don't know if I want to do that.
[46:20.54]Alright, put it up.
[46:57.68]Fuck.
[47:00.60]Oh, he didn't... I thought he was gonna do a move.
[47:25.01]The thing about trying to deflect all of his moves is you still have to hit him.
[47:28.49]And by the time that you are done deflecting, it's time to... He's gonna... You're dead.
[47:32.63]He's gonna swing at you again.
[47:33.75]It's hard to get a word in edgewise.
[47:45.70]I think I'm still taking damage too.
[47:47.06]Anybody catch that?
[47:54.04]I didn't.
[48:03.62]I'm already dead.
[48:15.39]Well, I'm gonna try it a couple times by parrying.
[48:19.36]It's like, you know what it's gonna have to be?
[48:20.62]It's gonna be parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, and then get the attacks by using the skill that I have.
[48:38.72]No, that's a bad idea.
[48:39.46]I should have parried.
[48:56.98]What?
[48:57.20]What?
[49:04.22]I made the blocking parry sound.
[49:19.20]Chip damage?
[49:19.82]Yeah.
[49:23.72]See, I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm just gonna try to play as hyper-safe as I can.
[49:27.82]Because trying to dodge around him too is just... He moves around so much... That the... Even the camera... The camera just can't keep up with it.
[49:41.57]So we're gonna attempt a... Oh, this is a free kill.
[49:51.12]God fuck off.
[49:56.74]Alright.
[50:13.64]I also have that move too.
[50:14.84]Let me try this.
[50:19.48]This one.
[50:19.88]I wonder if it's worth stunning him and doing that behind him.
[50:24.06]Maybe.
[50:28.06]How did that not block?
[50:29.40]I'm sitting in a hole in it.
[50:42.27]I don't know, that's not worth doing.
[50:50.85]That's probably not worth doing.
[51:06.02]God damn.
[51:09.02]It's so hard!
[51:11.92]It's gonna make me fucking scream!
[51:13.72]No, that was a mistake.
[51:32.99]Chip damage, I'm dead.
[51:38.27]Is this the only spot I can beat?
[51:40.32]This is the wall.
[51:41.18]I have to beat this.
[51:42.04]I don't think there's anywhere else I can go.
[51:46.70]I just have to beat it.
[51:47.42]I have to win.
[51:47.90]I don't have any pellets left either.
[52:28.88]No, what?
[52:29.64]No, I just did it right in his face.
[52:31.24]What the fu- Come on, what?
[52:42.71]That was... That wasn't part of the cooldown?
[52:48.60]That was like... Hold on, let me reset because the statue that shoots the gun just shot me.
[52:55.87]Hold on, guys.
[53:25.78]I had it that time too.
[53:27.66]Unfortunately.
[53:33.53]Just fuck it, man.
[53:34.23]I'm just gonna run at him.
[53:35.61]I'm just going at him aggressive.
[53:37.51]I'm gonna be more aggressive than he is.
[54:07.33]Fuck, wrong button.
[54:59.29]Yeah, fuck the defense dog shit.
[55:00.69]Go at him.
[55:01.13]Let's go.
[55:03.61]Stop talking.
[55:35.76]NOOOOOO!
[56:04.85]Fucking camera Come here
[56:40.27]Oh my god, I didn't jump it.
[56:41.97]How?
[56:43.77]I don't believe it.
[56:46.17]I refuse to believe it.
[56:48.29]I'll get him right here.
[56:48.83]Here we go.
[57:16.33]yeah fucking game stupid fucking game stupid I don't like it I don't like this fucking game it's too hard it's too hard it's too hard it's too hard it's too hard hey I beat it
[57:51.16]Alright, so healing, effective, okay cool.
[57:53.00]Huh?
[58:01.81]That was fucking intense though.
[58:18.58]But here's the thing.
[58:19.18]I know this isn't Dark Souls.
[58:22.08]And I know it's like you gotta play it completely differently.
[58:23.90]But sometimes you don't.
[58:25.24]Sometimes you have to just play like you're playing a Bloodborne boss.
[58:28.84]That's what I did differently that one time right here.
[58:31.40]Is just fuck it.
[58:32.38]Forget about like... Just go after him.
[58:34.54]Dodge.
[58:34.88]Go after him.
[58:35.28]Go, go, go, go, go.
[58:40.21]Where is the bull though?
[58:41.03]For real.
[58:45.30]The more you stand there and like, oh, what move is he going to do next?
[58:47.74]Oh, watch out!
[58:55.55]Nothing in here?
[58:59.15]I hope this is a place for me to hide.
[59:02.99]He got disenchanted.
[59:04.26]Alright, let me just wait.
[59:06.10]Thank heavens.
[59:07.72]Thank heavens.
[59:08.14]Thank heavens.
[59:15.63]I have.
[59:15.91]I wish there was a forward... This was an up right bumper to kick down into the...
[59:46.09]I'll take it.
[59:46.47]Let me get that item.
[60:06.39]Well, let's take a look down here.
[60:07.93]Cool.
[60:16.00]More people that way.
[60:16.71]Let's check.
[60:17.81]Let me get the item first.
[60:18.71]Is this going to hurt?
[60:26.50]No.
[60:28.16]Alright, where's the item?
[60:32.99]Wasn't there an item down here?
[60:33.89]Or was it the other side?
[60:51.21]Uh... What?
[60:53.05]What is it?
[60:54.35]An item?
[61:05.41]Alright, that was weird.
[61:06.53]Oh, it's right here.
[61:09.37]Is it... It's just... Oh.
[61:13.18]Oh.
[61:15.20]It's just extra spirit emblems.
[61:18.62]Well, I'm down here.
[61:19.42]Might as well be down here.
[61:25.17]What?
[61:35.01]What?
[61:36.71]Okay, well, I need to get back up here.
[61:43.67]Yeah, no secret walls.
[61:45.50]How do I get... Is there a spot I can jump to?
[61:49.34]Or do I have to just live out the rest of my days down here?
[61:55.29]Here we go.
[62:04.65]There's a fucking wallpaper for you right there.
[62:06.37]No, no, no.
[62:06.73]Right, right, right.
[62:07.17]I'll tell you when.
[62:08.25]I'll tell you when.
[62:08.65]Ready?
[62:11.11]Now.
[62:11.65]No.
[62:12.59]Now.
[62:14.25]Now.
[62:15.65]Now.
[62:18.05]Hope you got a good screenshot there.
[62:19.83]And then just like smear out the shit on the bottom left and right.
[62:31.50]Gate is firmly sealed shut.
[62:36.28]Well, that's not good.
[62:37.99]Oh, look, a memory!
[63:02.95]No, I will.
[63:05.03]Why did you link the slap?
[63:09.16]Why, of all things?
[63:10.10]Alright, let's go this way.
[63:23.95]That's by far the most embarrassing thing I've done on Twitch.
[63:29.07]There's a lot of layers as to why that is.
[63:37.28]Well, I could go straight up the stairs, but there's a lot of people there.
[63:42.26]Does this open?
[63:43.86]This also opens.
[63:47.50]Worse than dinosaur on green screen?
[63:48.84]Yeah, way worse.
[63:51.42]The dinosaur on green screen was intentional.
[63:56.24]Ooh, iron.
[63:58.69]I need to go take a look at what I can do with these.
[64:00.69]Fuck, man.
[64:05.83]So much cool shit in this game.
[64:17.60]What is down here?
[64:21.72]Pellets.
[64:22.32]I need those.
[64:24.54]And a cellar?
[64:30.12]THE cellar?
[64:32.64]It's worse if you meant to do the raptor.
[64:37.52]Yeah, but that's my own doing.
[64:40.58]I really did not mean to hit myself in the face hard.
[64:46.16]That's another form of embarrassment.
[64:51.66]intentional whoops that was not like I shouldn't have done that I thought that was going to be different is a lot different than I just hit myself in the face as hard as I could but I didn't though wow that was really hard intentional embarrassment's not not worse no because I know what I knew what I was getting into
[65:21.22]When I put on the dinosaur ski mask, I knew what I was getting into.
[65:26.13]I had a moment off screen.
[65:27.97]I was stage right.
[65:29.41]I had the gloves on and I had the mask on and I'm like, I'm about to do this.
[65:33.59]Here I go.
[65:33.99]Hmm.
[65:45.40]Go this way.
[65:52.08]Machine of Reservoir?
[65:56.08]Did we find the... the branch that goes this way?
[66:01.44]I... that... we're just gonna go this way.
[66:08.73]Wow, that was almost death.
[66:12.71]Would I ever put the Raptor on again?
[66:13.95]No.
[66:15.63]I don't think so.
[66:16.85]Wait, no, this... this is the... this is the beginning of the game.
[66:23.53]We went all the way around a circle here.
[66:25.43]This is the very beginning of the game.
[66:30.07]Because I didn't have the grapple hook before.
[66:34.34]Oh, okay.
[66:36.92]Interesting.
[66:37.66]So does that mean that can I now go somewhere in the beginning that I couldn't go before?
[66:41.54]Because of the grapple hook?
[66:47.86]Oh, would you look at that?
[66:57.21]Uh oh.
[67:01.52]That's cool.
[67:02.80]I don't have the axe on.
[67:08.54]Doesn't really help me here.
[67:27.90]I gotta get some parries.
[67:29.42]Because no way I'm gonna take that head off without him.
[67:37.13]Come on!
[67:37.89]Take it off!
[67:39.63]Get your fucking hat off!
[67:44.86]Take that!
[67:48.84]Finally!
[67:49.28]Okay.
[67:56.18]Look at that R1 spam.
[67:58.70]Heavy coin purse and scrap iron.
[68:00.56]Cool.
[68:01.52]So it was really worth coming up here, wasn't it?
[68:05.68]Yeah.
[68:07.60]Oh boy.
[68:09.22]And I'm poisoned.
[68:15.58]Poison's a lot worse in this fucking game than any of the other ones!
[68:19.78]Whoa!
[68:21.30]That ticks fast.
[68:29.16]How long does it last for?
[68:43.27]Come on, man.
[68:43.87]Really?
[68:47.61]I think that's all I can do down here.
[68:51.68]It was worth coming to get the iron.
[68:59.22]I don't think there's much else I can do here.
[69:02.82]Maybe up this way.
[69:09.59]Stinky Sekiro.
[69:12.79]Nope.
[69:18.41]But I can go over here.
[69:26.79]So this leads back...
[69:28.88]Up to that second area.
[69:37.05]This leads to here.
[69:39.77]So then, let's go this way.
[69:41.81]Might as well just rest here.
[69:47.91]Speedrunners are beating this game in 20 minutes.
[69:50.71]It takes 20 minutes to run from that first zone probably to where I'm standing right now.
[69:56.36]I don't believe that yet.
[69:57.22]I don't think anyone's beaten the game yet.
[69:59.06]I looked on the steamachievements.org and 0% completion at the moment.
[70:06.72]So, I mean, nice jebait attempt.
[70:08.81]You almost jebaited me there.
[70:14.03]Speaking of trying to not die...
[70:21.72]I'm just going to have to get it done.
[70:22.60]You know what I mean?
[70:23.30]Like, just get it done.
[70:28.28]Dogs first.
[70:41.09]Get her dead.
[70:43.35]There's one time I went down to the store and I tell you... You guys know that guy's not really...
[70:52.80]That's just a character.
[70:53.48]You guys know that, right?
[71:01.11]I thought about this for a long time.
[71:05.11]You know, like, Grandpa?
[71:06.03]I had this conversation with myself.
[71:10.45]Is it worth, like, $50 million for me to have to become Grandpa?
[71:17.90]This is what I do.
[71:19.06]I'm just an old fucking guy every day.
[71:21.66]And that's me.
[71:23.96]I have to change everything.
[71:24.84]I have to just be grandpa.
[71:27.12]In my conversations with people, in my everyday life, in my, you know, shows, I just have to be grandpa.
[71:35.22]For life.
[71:38.98]That's what Larry the Cable Guy is doing right now.
[71:41.63]He's doing grandpa for life.
[71:52.61]I think I can jump up.
[71:53.45]Yeah, I can get up there.
[71:59.08]Probably not in private.
[72:01.08]I'm not so sure about that, though, guys.
[72:04.58]For one very important reason.
[72:06.98]If you do a voice for long enough, over and over again, you kind of just start to... It would just become your everyday life.
[72:17.61]If 8 out of 24 hours in a day you're talking like Grandpa, you're going to have a conversation with your mother like that.
[72:23.74]That's just going to happen.
[72:28.04]And maybe it would be a little different like this or something, but I talk like this every single second of every day.
[72:35.01]You would permanently change your vocal cords.
[72:36.61]And by the way, I'm kind of being stupid here.
[72:52.65]Can anybody see me?
[72:59.38]I cleared out the archers, that's good.
[73:03.40]Alright.
[73:05.38]Can he see?
[73:05.94]Are these not stealth bushes?
[73:08.42]Yeah, they are.
[73:09.96]Oh, shit, he's coming.
[73:13.26]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[73:15.33]Go after this one, this one, this one, this one.
[73:23.51]You punch too, do you?
[73:26.57]Shit.
[73:27.03]Okay.
[73:27.45]Stop it, stop it, stop it.
[73:28.43]Cut it out.
[73:35.27]No.
[73:36.39]It's always the slow ones that cause me so many problems.
[73:40.04]Every time.
[73:41.68]No!
[73:48.92]Watch out.
[73:49.26]This is going to jump on somebody's head here.
[74:08.33]Oh, you assholes.
[74:22.97]Don't even think about it.
[74:25.16]Fire?
[74:27.30]Fire doesn't really do much to you.
[74:28.74]Wow!
[74:37.40]What about you?
[74:37.76]Are you guys beasts?
[74:40.40]Kind of.
[74:41.92]Kind of.
[74:59.03]Oh my god!
[75:00.01]This is- come on!
[75:01.25]Jesus!
[75:03.93]How do I separate you two?
[75:09.47]If one's not swinging, the other one's getting ready to swing.
[75:27.35]Come on, come on, come on!
[75:28.57]Come on!
[75:29.11]Where's the fuck Kofu?
[75:32.57]Where was his bottom bar?
[75:34.77]Oh my god!
[75:42.58]His bottom bar was, like, blank.
[75:44.30]I'm just angry now, and it's causing a problem.
[75:48.80]I'm dead.
[75:53.39]No, I'm not.
[75:53.79]Fuck it.
[75:54.11]I'm not losing that shit.
[76:09.78]Oh.
[76:14.25]By the way, you just came from a boss that attacks 50 times a second, and I'm here to show you.
[76:30.82]I'm so mad right now.
[76:38.00]He's gonna kill me.
[76:38.88]I'm just gonna run.
[76:49.54]Just open a fucking door.
[76:50.96]It's locked.
[76:58.61]What do we got over here?
[77:30.85]I get the last laugh!
[77:32.85]No I don't.
[77:34.28]I thought I was gonna get an uh,
[77:55.38]It truly stirs my soul.
[77:57.90]Beautiful.
[77:59.36]And yet somehow sad.
[78:02.24]As if it yearns and calls for someone.
[78:07.96]Uh... Hey.
[78:10.47]Who are you calling?
[78:11.89]Hey.
[78:13.49]Let me hear it one more time.
[78:16.59]Hey, you.
[78:17.43]What?
[78:19.07]My name is Jinzaimon Kumano.
[78:21.94]My duty is to patrol the moat.
[78:24.74]I've not seen you around before.
[78:26.30]Hey there.
[78:26.82]Which clan are you?
[78:28.51]I cannot say.
[78:29.97]You cannot say, you say?
[78:33.91]So you are a shinobi then?
[78:35.67]I didn't even tell him.
[78:36.57]I cannot say.
[78:37.99]Your manners could use some work.
[78:40.11]No matter.
[78:40.83]If you are a shinobi, I won't press any further.
[78:46.87]Is that it?
[78:48.45]He's coughing.
[78:49.31]Have you ever heard someone playing the shamisen?
[78:52.47]Cough in my face.
[78:53.11]I need to go back and bring it to the lady.
[78:54.35]He has a huge sword.
[78:54.87]Yeah, that's right.
[79:27.00]Shamisen.
[79:28.24]Okay, so... The Shamisen is down here.
[79:35.50]What's up here?
[79:48.07]Uh... Well, I think I just figured out a way to take a full bar off that guy.
[79:52.27]Okay.
[79:58.65]Not right now, obviously, because I have no health.
[80:06.96]Hey, I'll be back.
[80:07.50]You stay there.
[80:07.94]Alright, I can go in here.
[80:25.10]Wait.
[80:27.68]This doesn't open.
[80:29.36]That I could go?
[80:29.90]This is the tutorial zone.
[80:31.64]Remember I went in here?
[80:32.36]Where's the big guy?
[80:42.08]I will have my revenge.
[80:43.04]There's somebody else here.
[80:47.05]Okay.
[80:59.25]I will have my revenge.
[81:15.51]Wait till he turns around, then I'm going to go right behind him.
[81:31.30]You didn't hear a thing.
[81:36.39]I just Kool-Aid man through this guy's apartment window.
[81:44.63]Alright, did it.
[81:47.67]I need, what the hell do I need?
[81:57.82]What?
[81:58.70]No, no, no, no!
[82:00.00]I need a save point!
[82:02.57]Not a boss!
[82:18.00]Oh!
[82:18.84]Ah!
[82:19.16]Ah!
[82:20.44]How do I... He's just guarding me.
[82:23.87]I just smash brothers all over again.
[82:27.88]Come on, Diddy Kong!
[82:29.12]Give me a break!
[82:29.74]What do you got in here?
[82:41.93]What are you guarding in here?
[82:42.61]Why are you doing this?
[82:44.77]What's in here?
[82:59.86]Rule number one, never leave your house.
[83:17.18]I didn't think he'd really come back in that quick.
[83:21.06]You scared the shit out of me.
[83:22.06]He's scared.
[83:22.60]Now somebody else is dying.
[83:28.18]Uh...
[83:29.68]Well, I know where two people are.
[83:31.24]Let's see if I can get there without causing any problems.
[83:37.33]The one dude's over there.
[83:38.79]Let's see if I can... Let's just go this way.
[83:40.93]Okay, so up there... No, not the guy with the frying pan!
[84:00.07]Okay.
[84:09.50]There wasn't anybody to alert anyways, so.
[84:12.56]Let's go this way.
[84:13.84]Why can't I just stand up here?
[84:20.31]I can't like break this and open that door from the other side?
[84:22.69]I probably can, right?
[84:32.45]Alright.
[84:35.33]I should be able to... I wonder if I can avoid the big guys and just fight the dude up on the stairs.
[84:44.46]Oh yeah, definitely.
[84:46.00]So this is the route to go.
[84:48.82]Somebody saw me.
[84:52.30]Although, can I?
[84:56.24]Who saw me?
[84:56.68]The big guy?
[85:14.25]question maybe I can I get behind him and take off one of his bars maybe now that would be cool I wonder let's go all the way around absolutely watch this shit I'm gonna go sneak through the house the door I the tutorial door and I'm gonna backstab him he can have no fucking idea
[85:44.40]on okay I don't know how that happened oh this is gonna be perfect but there's a cutscene let's okay let's watch the cutscene
[86:16.56]Rule number two, leave your house so you don't get back stabbed.
[86:34.62]Hello!
[86:36.86]I'll take a free bar, please.
[86:39.50]If you could.
[86:40.02]So he's gonna thrust.
[86:55.10]Thrust.
[86:55.84]What else you got?
[87:02.00]That's a sweep, okay.
[87:06.93]Oh, fuck.
[87:09.43]Fuck.
[87:09.95]I'm dead.
[87:12.59]Fuck.
[87:14.19]I might be able to still kill him, though.
[87:19.51]What?
[87:20.81]What the fuck?
[87:23.17]Why?
[87:25.69]You gotta be kidding me.
[87:28.02]One hit kill.
[87:28.96]Why did everybody have one of these?
[87:30.42]I gotta get that back.
[87:33.64]I just have no idea what the fuck he even does.
[87:38.41]This has got full baseball insta-kill.
[87:40.51]Unseen aid.
[87:41.15]Okay, well I... That doesn't... Who cares?
[87:46.83]Prediction mask.
[87:47.44]I got juggled.
[87:48.12]I'm like playing Street Fighter right now.
[87:58.70]GOD!
[88:02.00]Oh, come on!
[88:08.33]Bro, it's fantastic.
[88:12.91]Well, so he has a thrust, he has a sweep, and he also has a giant baseball swing, and now... The guy with the dinner plate now ruined the whole thing.
[88:28.96]I can beat this guy.
[88:29.56]I mean, it's very clearly I got one tick on him already.
[88:39.67]Just gonna hang on the ledge.
[88:56.70]Just run and get another backstab on him.
[89:01.30]I mean, I don't know if that's possible.
[89:03.94]If it is, this game doesn't know what kind of game it wants to be.
[89:07.92]If that's possible.
[89:11.91]Like, are you a stealth game or are you an action game, right?
[89:14.37]Because if I can backstab him, run away, and then backstab him, like, what the hell is going on here?
[89:30.89]If you run away, he gets two bars again.
[89:32.31]Okay, that's... I'm glad that happened.
[89:34.80]You shouldn't be able to do that.
[89:37.58]Otherwise, you could just do that to everybody.
[89:48.39]Let's go.
[89:54.71]That's a sweep.
[89:59.52]Oh, he digs it into the ground.
[90:00.78]He doesn't go straight forward.
[90:10.43]What?
[90:10.67]Just... Did he explode?
[90:18.25]Oh my god.
[90:28.34]Fuck.
[90:36.81]Oh man.
[90:39.21]It's so slow.
[90:49.20]Unlike any game I've ever played, the absolutely just tremendous amount of focus you have to have in each one of these fights.
[90:57.49]It doesn't matter who it is.
[90:58.51]I forgot about the guy with the fucking pan again.
[91:13.88]You always have to worry about the one guy.
[91:18.06]The one guy that makes every route annoying.
[91:20.72]They're always there.
[91:23.76]Don't forget about me!
[91:24.72]Ding, ding, ding!
[91:25.48]Remember me?
[91:26.02]I'm the one that causes all the fucking problems here!
[91:29.26]That's me!
[91:29.76]I'm one person that causes every issue!
[91:33.28]I'm the noise statue.
[91:34.76]You ran into the gun statue.
[91:37.78]Oh, sorry.
[91:38.72]I don't use weapons.
[91:39.70]I just smash my plates together and make everybody come after you.
[91:43.65]Oh, everybody else on the whole map?
[91:44.83]Fuck them.
[91:45.17]You don't need to worry about me.
[91:46.47]And only me.
[92:06.84]Who saw that?
[92:19.57]Oh, he saw me.
[92:33.86]Alright, here we go again.
[92:35.10]Hi.
[92:39.51]I'm here for you to baseball one hits kill me again.
[92:42.97]Just kidding.
[92:48.62]I saw him!
[92:49.04]I'm coming to help you!
[93:13.18]It's a sweep, not a fucking...
[93:39.80]Again, oh, it just takes up the whole fucking screen.
[94:00.02]God.
[94:05.08]I keep on trying to get it.
[94:06.08]He's got such quick...
[94:14.10]Not enough.
[94:14.50]Oh, I didn't get it.
[94:16.48]He just varies up his timing so much.
[94:18.88]It's either going to be a big baseball swing or a little... No, don't go.
[94:31.25]I'm going the wrong way.
[94:31.95]Just rest.
[94:35.81]It's like the rock, paper, scissors between sweep, stab.
[94:39.36]You've got that tenth of a second to figure it out.
[94:43.82]Fuck, this game is brutal.
[94:44.90]I'll get him.
[94:51.46]I made a fucking joke.
[94:52.86]I made a joke and he still hit it.
[95:05.35]I might just go reset.
[95:13.21]This game looks amazing.
[95:14.05]It is.
[95:14.75]Oh, it is.
[95:16.29]It's fucking unbelievable.
[95:17.89]It's just brutal.
[95:33.82]I fucked this whole thing up.
[95:56.81]It's like punishing.
[95:57.99]It really is like a fucking fighting game.
[96:02.59]The punishment for mistakes in Sekiro is way, way more aggressive than it is in any of the other games they've ever made.
[96:10.19]You make a mistake in Sekiro?
[96:11.87]Oh, fuck you.
[96:13.20]Fuck you.
[96:15.20]You made a mistake in like Dark Souls?
[96:16.88]You could take a few hits and you could fuck it up a couple times.
[96:21.28]You got like 10 Estus, sometimes 15 Estus flasks to drink.
[96:42.76]That big guy's gonna see me, isn't he?
[96:44.09]Alright, here we go.
[97:03.06]Ooh, I couldn't really block that.
[97:16.07]Careful.
[97:18.01]Got it.
[97:24.96]He's not gonna go off the... We're in such a stupid place right now.
[97:28.02]Come on.
[97:30.52]Why did we go over here?
[97:32.12]He's like just stuck over on the...
[97:48.61]I don't even know what the fuck that was.
[97:52.94]Got it.
[98:00.28]What?
[98:00.68]Come on!
[98:01.24]I didn't jump over it?
[98:02.48]What?
[98:05.87]What?
[98:12.29]I thought I clearly jumped over it.
[98:21.19]That was a big sweep, right?
[98:32.24]What are tools?
[98:34.36]I don't, like, don't know which one to use here.
[98:39.57]I'm just trying to get his moves down to fight him.
[98:41.23]I mean, it's one thing to use the tools.
[98:46.89]It's another thing to, like, I don't even... I gotta get down, like, how to even fight and parry him.
[99:14.11]That's not a sweep.
[99:15.41]Are you sure?
[99:15.81]It looks very sweep-ish.
[99:26.51]He comes, like, up with it.
[99:33.83]Let me see what else I got here.
[99:40.20]Dirt, oil...
[99:43.52]Go for equipment fire axe.
[99:46.22]I don't want to use that here I'll try throwing dirt at him firecracker.
[99:57.69]I don't know if it's gonna work very well, but I'll try I
[100:16.45]Alright.
[100:20.53]Somebody was saying, don't fight them on the stairs.
[100:22.06]Well, if I don't fight them on the stairs, if I bring them down, I have to clear the whole area.
[100:26.34]Right?
[100:26.56]Because if I bring them down there, there's like two big guys, like two archers, three... I'm going to fight them up here.
[100:35.09]I'll aggro the whole fucking town if I go down there.
[100:41.57]Alright, let's see.
[100:42.07]Here, eat some dirt.
[100:50.58]Okay, well it's parryable, but it hurts- it gives me a lot of bullshit.
[100:59.48]Yeah.
[101:00.75]Jesus Christ.
[101:10.38]Yeah, just- Eeeek.
[101:27.61]I didn't catch... No, I didn't want to do that.
[101:30.80]I didn't want to do that.
[101:33.54]No, no!
[101:33.98]I got the wrong thing equipped!
[101:34.84]Oh my god.
[101:55.25]It's hard to get around him too because I need to take his health down.
[101:58.67]I gotta dodge around him.
[102:02.22]I need to hurt him.
[102:02.82]I have no fucking idea what he was doing there.
[102:24.72]It's hard to tell with that what he's going to even do.
[102:42.99]Oh my goodness gracious.
[102:58.36]He does so much posture damage, even if you deflect him.
[103:16.97]No, I forgot again about the one guy with the fucking pan.
[103:20.07]I'm resetting it.
[103:26.49]I'm just so focused on fighting this guy that I happen to fucking... It's my one gripe with all these games.
[103:34.51]Like, you're so focused on fighting the guy that you want to fight that you just... I want to go fight that guy, not, like, run-through pan guy 30 times.
[103:41.34]Okay.
[103:59.39]What?
[103:59.83]Oh.
[104:02.72]Okay.
[104:03.50]Somebody can still see me.
[104:40.61]Use firecrackers?
[104:41.31]I'll give it a try.
[104:51.97]Hello?
[105:03.22]That guy went all the way around.
[105:20.63]Yeah, imagine not backstabbing this guy.
[105:23.59]God, it would be hell.
[105:47.87]I don't want to...
[105:49.66]That shit takes too much posture.
[105:51.28]I just gotta get away from it.
[105:57.60]Nope, there it is.
[105:58.66]It doesn't do it that often.
[106:04.37]Do you see how much recovery that, like... Okay, so I did... I did the fucking... I stepped on it for the Slash, and then it immediately does another move that I'm still stuck on animation.
[106:15.68]Like, I'm in the animation right now still.
[106:17.14]See?
[106:29.89]When you step on it, you have to parry.
[106:30.85]Yeah, but he, like, pulls it out.
[106:51.05]Go to the right instead.
[106:51.95]Let me see.
[107:02.73]Whatever, just bring it back to the fucking idle.
[107:04.73]Classic case of get good.
[107:07.73]Yeah.
[107:08.25]No, that's absolutely certain because you literally cannot play this game.
[107:14.01]Go look up like threads about people talking about this game.
[107:16.54]People are like giving up on the game because they can't do it.
[107:22.80]If you don't get good at Sekiro, you don't get to play.
[107:27.97]That's pretty much how it goes.
[107:29.29]So... Where am I?
[107:30.33]What am I doing?
[107:34.75]No.
[107:35.31]How can I reach it from there but not reach it from here?
[107:37.74]So what?
[107:51.52]You're saying like from this direction you mean?
[107:52.99]Let me just take a look.
[107:54.59]Let me just look at it.
[107:59.36]I'm gonna deal with these guys, but let me just see what you mean.
[108:04.37]Like up on the roof?
[108:05.27]Like over this way?
[108:05.95]So if I go from roof to here... Well... And then to here... Oh, alright.
[108:28.17]Yeah, but he sees you here though.
[108:32.15]Does he not see you?
[108:35.61]I guess he just doesn't see you if you do that.
[108:39.77]That's weird considering how good he is at everything else.
[108:44.60]I pulled everybody though.
[108:48.80]How did you not know this guy's coming over here to fight me?
[108:53.40]Does he know?
[108:58.84]He still doesn't know.
[109:03.40]He's just pretending.
[109:04.24]He's gonna turn in baseball swing and I'm gonna die.
[109:06.85]And then I'm gonna go on like the Reddit and be like, guys, I don't know if I can do this.
[109:12.15]It's fucking insane.
[109:26.22]I'm so much in trouble.
[109:28.68]I'm in trouble!
[109:41.43]God, I distracted him!
[109:47.49]I'm just gonna back away when he does it.
[109:49.35]I haven't figured out the reliable way.
[110:01.91]Fuck, why?
[110:03.45]I couldn't, I didn't, I didn't have enough.
[110:06.53]It's so, he strings it together so fast.
[110:16.00]No, that's the longer one.
[110:32.33]This guy's worse than the other bosses in the game.
[110:50.87]Worse than the ball?
[110:53.83]Maybe the bowl only had like one or two the bowl really only had one thing speed and Psycho didn't really have much out fucking pan guy Yes FromSoftware.
[111:05.86]I'm aware.
[111:06.30]I gotta kill the guy with the pan every time why am I coming over here?
[111:09.04]Oh?
[111:10.42]My god, I just want to fucking play the game Fuck it.
[111:16.42]I'm going this way Oh
[111:24.76]I'm about to go on Reddit.
[111:26.85]Yeah, guys, I'm having a lot of trouble with the game.
[111:29.05]There's this pan guy.
[111:31.29]Is there a way to spike the pan into his skull as hard as I can and make it so that enemy never comes back?
[111:49.89]I actually read an article.
[111:51.19]I looked up an article.
[111:52.19]There's an article that says, Is Sekiro the hardest game ever made?
[111:55.74]It might be.
[112:02.30]It might be.
[112:04.16]Maybe E.T.
[112:06.00]E.T.
[112:06.32]was impossible.
[112:14.20]Battletoads 2 was up there.
[112:23.80]So you got ET, Battletoads, and then Sekiro.
[112:36.77]Lock on to him.
[112:40.17]Is there somebody?
[112:42.13]Where are you coming from?
[112:46.43]Good, I like a challenge.
[112:47.42]Bring it on.
[113:12.02]Oh my... God.
[113:15.71]I gotta get off this fucking staircase.
[113:32.17]No, we're the fucking guy here.
[113:37.50]Have to fight him one-on-one.
[113:38.68]Otherwise, like, don't even fucking try.
[113:49.40]Use the dodge to step on his spear.
[113:50.60]I've done it like 30 times.
[113:54.10]I've done it.
[114:08.77]I don't know why left bumper wasn't working there.
[114:10.77]What the fuck, man?
[114:23.71]Listen for the clicks when I did this last time.
[114:27.65]And I'm going the wrong way again.
[114:40.24]What are you doing?
[114:41.70]What the fuck are you doing, game?
[114:45.46]Oh my god.
[114:47.51]Why are you like this?
[114:57.69]Am I playing Assassin's Creed?
[115:00.05]Is there a reason why?
[115:00.87]I was getting like fucking stuck on the ledge.
[115:09.81]What the fuck is happening right now?
[115:12.09]Come on.
[115:12.95]What?
[115:14.74]Oh my god.
[115:28.43]Just fucking kill me.
[115:29.29]I don't even care.
[115:29.97]Just reset it, please!
[115:32.55]Why did the lights turn off in my house?
[115:34.23]Like, come here!
[115:35.35]Alright, let's try this again.
[116:26.85]I have to kill this motherfucker.
[116:40.35]I don't, why?
[116:42.13]I don't know if I like coming this way.
[116:54.87]Unless, can I get there from up here or something?
[116:56.90]Who is even looking over here?
[116:58.82]What?
[116:59.40]You came all the way from the courtyard.
[117:27.24]He's just waiting for him.
[117:28.64]This way is... I don't know if I want to go this way.
[117:30.34]Because they keep wa... Come on.
[117:36.04]Come get me.
[117:36.52]Let's go.
[117:36.84]I don't even know where that guy came from.
[117:53.23]Do that again, but this way.
[118:00.98]No, what?
[118:01.64]Come on.
[118:06.80]Fall with me, at least make it worth it for me.
[118:13.93]Enemies don't fall off platforms in this game.
[118:17.48]Oh.
[118:23.23]I'm gonna go the route that I know.
[118:25.09]When I go that way, I just pull everybody.
[118:26.60]And then they walk this way.
[118:29.88]I just have to worry about stupid f***ing pan guy.
[119:04.32]Let's go.
[119:09.38]So, I can go that way, but will he see me, I wonder.
[119:13.00]I wonder.
[119:13.26]Let me just try this.
[119:21.27]I don't think he saw me do that.
[119:31.90]I'm so worried about this guy turning around.
[119:33.10]This guy's so oblivious to everything.
[119:36.66]But then again, big guy's still here.
[119:43.70]Hydrate?
[119:44.18]I will.
[119:44.44]I'll be fine.
[119:45.94]I will.
[119:49.64]That guy in the other hand is not leaving.
[119:54.54]Okay, turn around.
[119:55.74]Get out of here.
[119:59.68]Alright, if I don't beat him right here, I'm going to go get some water.
[120:02.83]And fucking... Just pee.
[120:06.95]And... No, I'm beating him right now.
[120:19.92]Okay.
[120:29.52]That was so delayed.
[120:31.32]It's so fucking delayed.
[120:32.78]It's so hard to time it.
[120:40.59]No, I've seen if I had frames on it.
[120:42.22]No, I'm dead.
[120:44.16]Jesus Christ.
[120:45.00]I'll have your back.
[122:49.56]Going offline.
[122:50.60]What?
[122:56.74]Fuck, this game is so brutal, man.
[122:59.28]It's so fucking brutal.
[123:02.50]It hates you.
[123:03.68]Everybody makes that joke.
[123:04.62]Like, oh, Dark Souls.
[123:06.24]FromSoftware.
[123:08.14]You're gonna die.
[123:09.48]You're gonna lose.
[123:11.12]You're gonna lose.
[123:14.01]Not only are you gonna lose in this game.
[123:17.75]But, man.
[123:21.58]FromSoftware's gonna make sure nobody goes to your funeral.
[123:25.54]You know what I mean?
[123:42.25]Easy game.
[123:47.95]Oh, hold on, my stream deck is fucked up.
[123:59.03]It's definitely because you're sick.
[124:00.47]No.
[124:02.14]Am I going to Pax East?
[124:02.92]I am not going to Pax East.
[124:05.80]Unfortunately.
[124:08.08]I live on the west coast now, just something that wasn't really in the cards anymore.
[124:11.32]He actually got that off.
[124:18.83]No he didn't.
[124:22.85]Hey, beat the game now.
[124:26.27]Stop trying.
[124:28.61]I'm trying.
[124:29.17]I miss the old Sekiro streams.
[124:39.08]There's only been two.
[124:41.12]One of them is yesterday.
[124:42.24]I miss the old Sekiro streams.
[124:44.94]You know, the one from yesterday.
[124:48.54]When he got so mad that he pretended to fall down a well in his fucking room.
[125:07.38]Yeah, the good old days, like yesterday.
[125:09.70]Alright.
[125:21.01]Wait for... Can I go up the stairs?
[125:39.07]There's nothing else up here.
[125:39.83]Alright.
[125:45.66]Come on.
[125:46.04]Just beat him.
[125:46.82]Beat this guy.
[125:47.56]This guy's giving me more trouble than anybody.
[125:49.26]And he's not even a real boss.
[125:51.18]He's a fake boss.
[126:08.16]Well, that was weird.
[127:26.18]I just want to thank everybody for supporting me this whole time.
[127:33.04]I want to thank my mom for giving me the constant support that she has for my entire life.
[127:43.75]Where's the emote?
[127:48.87]How do I do the emote?
[127:54.66]How do I... How do I, like, physics roll this guy off the cliff?
[127:59.99]And then do a full P-Stream down on his body.
[128:05.83]Oh, I'm so... Hardest game ever made, I'm telling you.
[128:18.30]Now how does it feel that you are like the second hardest thing I've done in this game?
[128:24.28]First hardest thing was even turning it on.
[128:27.06]You know?
[128:29.22]Who the hell are you?
[128:39.59]I got overconfidence now, let's go.
[128:42.27]I got my confidence back.
[128:49.35]What's that line?
[128:49.93]Alright, stop fucking around, get out of here.
[129:04.26]Get out, out, out, out, out, out.
[129:10.42]Going up top.
[129:17.65]I got four beads now.
[129:20.20]Ooh, the... Come on.
[129:28.81]Restore a node of Resurrective Power.
[129:37.79]To enslave a Jizo statue, it is to express... Okay, so I can... I'm so happy I beat that guy.
[129:48.11]Do you guys think this is the hardest game ever made?
[129:50.35]What do you guys think is the hardest game ever made?
[129:53.71]Okay, let me rephrase that.
[129:55.29]I know that there is modded Super Mario levels that are unbeatable.
[130:00.65]I'm talking about a game that was published by a major publisher.
[130:05.52]What do you think it is?
[130:22.48]The jewel.
[130:23.72]Ghosts and Goblins?
[130:26.97]Yeah, because I know people are going to tell me that, oh, boy, hold on a second, Jeremy.
[130:31.25]What about, like, Boshi?
[130:32.89]Right?
[130:33.27]Boshi is considered one of the hardest video games ever.
[130:40.23]But there's no ad for Boshi.
[130:41.96]There's no TV ads for Boshi.
[130:57.17]That's a bullshit requirement.
[130:59.17]No, I'm saying like a major AAA published game.
[131:03.68]And what do you think it is?
[131:05.20]Because there are a ton of indie titles that are insanely difficult.
[131:08.50]I'm talking about ones that are on the shelf at Walmart.
[131:20.31]I'm talking about games that you could just go and buy right now at GameStop.
[131:30.00]I asked that question 30 minutes ago, Jerma.
[131:31.62]Thanks for stealing my icebreaker conversation pieces.
[131:36.77]So, Sekiro is the hardest Walmart game.
[131:44.19]Yeah!
[131:45.22]Yeah!
[131:46.54]Okay?
[131:47.50]Sekiro is the... Sekiro is the hardest game you can buy at Walmart.
[131:55.54]Where am I supposed to go from here?
[132:13.09]Oh yeah, there was that... Oh yeah, wait, no, no, no.
[132:14.71]There's that other guy.
[132:15.39]Am I enjoying the game?
[132:17.42]I love this game.
[132:19.34]It's fucking awesome.
[132:21.34]It's making me... It's making me, like, question everything I've ever known in my life.
[132:26.29]It's testing me.
[132:29.79]You know, it's testing me like a true god should.
[132:43.78]What about the Surge?
[132:45.46]Are we talking about worst games you can buy at Walmart or hardest games you can buy at Walmart?
[133:06.83]The hardest Walmart game.
[133:08.39]That should be a tagline.
[133:10.07]Sekiro.
[133:14.03]Yeah.
[133:14.71]Sekiro.
[133:18.45]Be careful not to accidentally buy this.
[133:24.50]You will hate it.
[133:31.94]Sekiro.
[133:33.06]It's too hard for you, Grandma.
[133:35.69]Right?
[133:36.75]That would have been like a... If this was on Super Nintendo, that's what it would be.
[133:42.38]Alright, I need to get back up to... Where was that guy that was standing above the thing and he's like, Don't go down there unless you want to hear this music.
[133:48.82]I don't think that was back the other way, wasn't it?
[133:54.72]Have I even been over here?
[134:01.12]What's the point of me coming up here?
[134:14.78]What about this way?
[134:25.31]No, this is to come back out.
[134:26.65]Wait, is this that...?
[134:28.87]No.
[134:33.64]Your grandma definitely won't beat this game.
[134:35.72]But maybe she will.
[134:38.14]I don't know.
[134:38.54]It's possible.
[134:42.80]There's... Hold on.
[134:50.09]This is... Okay, right, yeah.
[134:52.67]Here we are.
[134:55.53]I didn't go up... I didn't go straight up there.
[135:01.89]How much money do I have?
[135:03.63]Well, I have enough to do this.
[135:09.82]Loose beads, more health, and more vitality.
[135:12.02]More posture.
[135:12.74]Alright, well then let's open up the new dialog then.
[135:23.31]What is the hardest fucking game?
[135:24.75]Ever.
[135:25.41]That is like a game and not an unbeatable joke troll game.
[135:37.80]You have the dragon rot.
[135:39.66]Ninjagate.
[135:41.72]Dragon's Lair.
[135:45.80]Wait, cough in my face.
[135:53.13]Take coughed up blood.
[135:58.79]I'm taking a blood sample.
[136:00.53]Please, if you could, do it directly into my mouth.
[136:07.72]Get as much of you can in there.
[136:21.94]What's the hardest movie to watch to get through, do you think?
[136:25.00]Because if we're going to have a video game definition, it has to be a movie and TV show definition.
[136:53.80]I got something for you.
[136:57.64]That's the hardest human activity.
[137:01.42]Without... Something that's not just like lifting weights.
[137:03.94]Something that's... Oh.
[137:05.77]Deadlift a thousand pounds.
[137:06.99]No.
[137:13.71]It's driving?
[137:15.05]It might be driving.
[137:16.73]Driving is a really difficult thing to do.
[137:19.34]It kind of just is.
[137:37.53]It's too easy sometimes, guys.
[137:38.94]Come on.
[137:40.48]Alright, what do I have here?
[137:41.32]Alright, I need to do one of these.
[137:47.28]What do I got?
[137:49.42]There's only a certain amount of these tools, though.
[137:57.07]Spring-loaded firecracker.
[138:01.96]Spring-loaded axe.
[138:14.60]We can go down Axe Tree.
[138:20.23]I kind of like the firecrackers, though.
[138:21.93]It's hard to mess up firecrackers.
[138:25.59]They're big radius.
[138:26.67]They sit around for a few frames.
[138:40.72]Cool down's not great though.
[138:43.46]I'm not really good with the slow weapons.
[138:49.81]Would you recommend this game to someone who just wants to have a good time or will I come to hate myself?
[138:54.71]It really depends on how you approach it.
[138:57.25]Because, I mean, you've seen, right?
[139:00.47]Anytime you play a game like this, you're going to hit that point.
[139:03.88]It happens to everybody.
[139:05.18]It does.
[139:06.38]And saying that it doesn't happen to you is just horseshit.
[139:09.62]And I don't believe you.
[139:11.20]And I would love to hook you up to a lie detector and have you say these words with a straight face.
[139:17.25]That you don't do these things.
[139:19.27]But...
[139:20.57]You're going to get upset at the game.
[139:22.87]It's going to happen.
[139:24.37]You're going to be irritated by something.
[139:26.89]You're going to lose over and over again, like you just watched me do in real time.
[139:33.75]You're going to lose like five times in a row to something and go, Why do I... Can I even do this?
[139:40.85]Am I capable of doing this?
[139:42.53]And you probably are, yeah.
[139:46.06]But if you are okay with getting through that sort of pushing a rock up a mountain, the experience is unforgettable.
[139:54.16]All these games.
[140:04.21]It happened to me like 10 minutes ago, yeah.
[140:08.38]It's very natural.
[140:11.71]to get upset at this game.
[140:13.87]Now, not to a point where, you know, obviously there's different levels of being upset.
[140:19.23]Because you can be like, what the fuck, like, fuck this, this is stupid, like, god, I blocked that!
[140:23.52]I blocked that!
[140:24.30]And then, like, you know, you obviously don't want to get to a level where you're, like, smashing shit and screaming as loud as you can and, like, if it's, you don't want, like, actual, like, real negative energy coming into your life because you can't beat a Sekiro boss.
[140:40.35]But as long as you, you know, you give yourself that limit.
[140:43.41]Take a break.
[140:44.49]I went downstairs and I drank some orange juice.
[140:58.54]Just smash the TV.
[141:00.12]No.
[141:05.65]But if you can put up with your own mind getting in the way.
[141:09.18]That's what happens.
[141:09.68]Every time I play these games, it happens.
[141:11.44]And I know it's going to happen.
[141:12.24]That's why I always push through it and just continue to go.
[141:14.96]Because no matter what I say, no matter how many things I say about... You know what?
[141:19.54]I think this is too hard.
[141:21.92]I'm not sure about this.
[141:22.60]This boss is... I think it's impossible.
[141:24.88]No, I can't do it.
[141:26.16]No, I'm going to try again.
[141:28.31]As long as you just fight through that devil on your shoulder telling you that you can't do it, you'll get better and you will.
[141:47.96]Also applies to life in general.
[141:49.96]There's a lot of symbolism while you play these games for, you know, getting in your own way, getting out of the way, trying, failing, succeeding.
[142:01.28]That's why they made these games.
[142:02.40]They knew what they were doing.
[142:09.61]Yeah, but how though?
[142:10.41]I really just keep dying.
[142:12.75]Uh...
[142:14.57]But that's a whole nother conversation entirely though.
[142:17.09]Maybe the game's just not for you.
[142:21.32]Like some people love that kind of intense punishing, punishing experience that forces you to do well, otherwise you won't do it at all.
[142:33.55]But you don't have to have it.
[142:35.17]You know, you don't have to do it.
[142:37.31]Look, that's what I'm here for, right?
[142:40.29]Just watch me.
[142:42.63]Scream at stuff and get upset about how bad I am at parrying something.
[142:53.38]But eventually I will beat it.
[142:55.94]I don't know when, but I'm trying to figure out what the hell I want to do here.
[143:00.38]I wonder what you unlock down.
[143:01.47]I might do firecrackers.
[143:02.67]Let's do it.
[143:08.09]Enemies in all directions.
[143:10.29]And then this...
[143:13.46]When you gave up on Celeste.
[143:14.54]I beat Celeste.
[143:15.12]I just didn't do the extra Celeste.
[143:20.93]Just got here.
[143:21.41]When does he play the game?
[143:24.25]I just was talking about like the difficulty and somebody asked like how hard it is to get into these games.
[143:28.84]Oh, I can't have like... I've been playing for like two and a half hours.
[143:32.16]I can't have like what?
[143:33.72]Two, three minutes of just talking for a second?
[143:40.11]Over the course of, like, what is going to be tonight, like, a ten-hour broadcast?
[143:45.11]No, no, no.
[143:45.95]How dare you spend three minutes talking about, like, somebody asked a question.
[143:49.01]What the fuck?
[143:49.59]Now I'm going to go down this path.
[144:01.86]I want to know what that is.
[144:03.72]Well, I don't have that tool.
[144:05.34]But I want it.
[144:07.00]Spring-loaded firecracker.
[144:08.04]I'm doing it.
[144:11.78]Long spark.
[144:15.83]Ooh.
[144:22.36]Long barrel.
[144:23.10]I wonder what this is.
[144:31.45]Yeah, I mean, this game is, like, really intense, too.
[144:34.17]So, if I... I just spent, like, almost an hour trying to beat that fucking samurai out in front of the steps there.
[144:41.66]I'm gonna take a second.
[144:43.38]I gotta collect myself a little, you know?
[144:48.92]But now... I'm glad you've come.
[144:54.42]Here's the sample.
[144:55.74]I've obtained one.
[144:56.51]A blood sample.
[144:58.51]Let me see.
[144:59.68]I know what BWL is.
[145:00.62]I beat that game, like, last week.
[145:01.82]Okay, do I have any seeds?
[145:27.95]BWL, he doesn't know.
[145:28.99]BWL, he doesn't know.
[145:31.47]Yes, I do.
[145:32.97]I looked up... I've got a confession to make.
[145:39.19]I really hate to say this, but I wanted to make sure I was prepared for the stream and that I'm like a streamer, you know?
[145:45.76]I read the Wikipedia page and I read every boss and every strategy and every reference and I know where every item is.
[145:52.42]Guys, I'm streaming it!
[145:53.66]I have to make sure I'm presenting it and I can keep going and don't get lost or stuck.
[145:59.65]I know everything.
[146:01.91]I know they did this weird thing, like... I know the last boss is... It's a giant... It's a snake with five heads.
[146:10.91]And then it transforms into a giant goat.
[146:15.91]And with horns and shit.
[146:16.91]I know what it is.
[146:19.19]I'm sorry.
[146:22.23]I'll try better next time.
[146:23.35]I'm sorry.
[146:24.57]Alright.
[146:27.06]Ooh, what's this stuff?
[146:30.71]Breath of Nature Light.
[146:33.23]Get that off the fucking screen.
[146:38.66]A latent skill increases the damage inflicted to posture upon performing a successful deflection.
[146:48.46]So, it's just more of this.
[146:53.09]No, that's not right.
[146:55.57]Recovers posture upon executing a successful deathblow.
[147:07.84]This reduces the amount of damage.
[147:09.12]I want this one.
[147:11.74]I'm gonna save up for this one.
[147:16.14]Isn't this too much of a normie game for me to be playing this?
[147:21.87]What?
[147:25.81]A normie game?
[147:30.03]Isn't this like the anti-normie game?
[147:35.41]This is not a game that, from your definition of a normie... What does that even mean?
[147:43.80]A normal person?
[147:45.08]What does that even mean?
[147:45.86]How dare you say that here?
[147:49.74]Walmart gaming.
[147:51.10]Unbelievable.
[147:58.77]Isn't this too much of a normie?
[148:00.27]I love fucking Dark Souls in these games.
[148:02.69]Come on, you've seen me play them all on stream.
[148:04.88]Too much of a normie game?
[148:09.16]What would you rather I play?
[148:10.36]I actually don't know where to go.
[148:18.98]It was... Was it the reservoir or was it the castle?
[148:25.43]Hold on a second.
[148:26.11]Where was it?
[148:31.24]It's the reservoir.
[148:31.98]No, it's not.
[148:38.84]Let me just go back here.
[148:46.21]Shrek Racing.
[148:48.37]They never made Shrek Racing.
[148:55.53]Hey, play some underground games.
[149:00.68]This is... Okay.
[149:02.02]I'm gonna really... I'm gonna hold up the shield here.
[149:04.44]I'm gonna defend... I'm gonna defend myself here.
[149:08.59]Can you guys name me the last... AAA release that I played on this stream?
[149:17.09]It's probably Resident Evil 2.
[149:26.36]Where was that guy?
[149:29.12]Down here?
[149:32.69]Yeah.
[149:34.48]No, where the fuck was he?
[149:40.50]Shit, no.
[149:41.14]Where is it?
[149:45.60]The guy that was looking over the well.
[149:49.76]It's over here, I think.
[150:05.86]I played Minecraft.
[150:07.04]I was forced to play Minecraft because I lost a bet.
[150:09.41]What are you doing?
[150:14.27]Anybody else find it funny that the time that I'm not trying to get there as fast as I can and kill Panguy, that Panguy doesn't make a sound.
[150:22.75]But when I get there really, really quickly, Panguy forgets... I know what happened here.
[150:28.34]This is a fucking actor.
[150:29.70]And he didn't expect me to come back.
[150:30.86]He was waiting for me those other times.
[150:34.50]So now he was surprised to see me.
[150:37.90]Oh, fuck!
[150:38.38]Wait, he's back here?
[150:40.04]Oh, there it is.
[150:45.66]Hey.
[150:51.05]I have not heard it, but I'm gonna go... Here we go.
[150:53.85]It's dropped down there.
[150:56.59]Check this out.
[151:02.01]Hey, look, another free orb.
[151:05.71]Hi there, how are you?
[151:14.61]Okay.
[151:26.50]Woof.
[151:29.14]Did I just hit him?
[151:32.10]Oh, ow ow ow ow ow ow.
[151:37.03]What is that?
[151:41.19]Where?
[151:42.09]And what does that classify as?
[152:04.90]What is that?
[152:05.44]Is that a thrust?
[152:07.80]Technically?
[152:08.26]It is, okay.
[152:10.94]That's a weird thrust.
[152:31.98]Not that time, buddy.
[152:36.94]Where the fuck am I?
[152:50.40]Fuck!
[152:50.74]It's okay.
[153:01.51]No!
[153:01.97]God damn it!
[153:04.09]My hand slipped!
[153:09.07]I just like, fuck, I had that too.
[153:13.89]My hands are like just covered in sweat.
[153:16.40]But you know what the problem was?
[153:20.26]Switching to this for no reason.
[153:22.70]In fact, just get it off the bar, you dumbass.
[153:24.80]What is it even there for?
[153:25.56]You know what I'm saying?
[153:31.52]Like, oh, let me switch to that.
[153:33.03]I already have it.
[153:34.71]Why would I need to do that?
[153:37.76]Fuck.
[153:42.80]I have the... Fuck.
[153:55.68]I bet that one was... When it gets orange... Never mind.
[154:05.87]I wish the indicator was bigger.
[154:10.89]What the fu- oh, come on!
[154:13.15]Why was that not a thing?
[154:14.75]Uh, bye game.
[154:36.11]I wasn't over him.
[154:39.47]This is kind of just what the hell I'm even doing this for at this point.
[154:59.41]The camera in here is so bad because of just how small the corridor is.
[155:42.85]See, that's a sweep.
[155:44.05]I haven't seen it yet.
[155:45.61]Sweep.
[156:10.52]Whoa, that didn't work!
[156:19.04]Alright, come here.
[156:42.83]Whoa, double kick, what the hell was that?
[157:05.21]Oh, goodbye.
[157:12.99]Just spam all the buttons.
[157:20.16]Oh, somebody else is dying now.
[157:25.48]Beautiful melody.
[157:26.42]Oh, that guy's sick too.
[157:27.33]The guy out here.
[157:43.62]Sorry, I had to do that.
[157:49.34]Cough in my face?
[157:50.00]I don't need any more blood.
[158:06.08]Alright, this time let me get a solid attempt here.
[158:10.03]By actually, like, getting the jumping stab.
[158:38.83]Oh, I'm in the corner.
[158:39.61]Bad.
[158:40.09]I can't fucking move.
[158:41.47]Oh my god.
[158:42.11]Why is that even possible?
[159:07.79]Welcome to Dark Souls games.
[159:10.09]If your back's in a corner, you may as well go microwave a fucking burrito.
[159:34.62]That's my motto too.
[159:42.98]Thankfully this is way easier to get back to than the other one.
[160:24.95]Oh, man.
[160:25.63]Oh, man.
[160:26.55]These movements are so erratic.
[160:43.36]It's pain.
[160:45.92]Am I alive?
[160:56.56]I can parry the kicks.
[160:57.48]I know, but when he fake pumps two of them, it's hard to do.
[161:18.06]Un-fucking-believable, man.
[161:19.97]Un-fucking-believable.
[161:21.23]I just want to get over there.
[162:21.74]Ah, I didn't even see it.
[162:24.90]He's breaking my posture so much, even when I parry.
[162:28.70]He's doing a dickload of posture damage, even when I'm blocking and parrying shit.
[162:35.09]Fuck.
[162:54.03]Nah, I gotta back up.
[163:03.19]Oh, she's broken!
[163:03.77]No, man, no!
[163:07.55]I gotta just... I can just go in.
[163:09.83]I'm just going in.
[163:10.35]I'm just doing the fucking... I'm gonna play the way of the game in a way that I know how.
[163:13.45]And that's fucking Burgah Boy technique.
[163:14.95]Just go in.
[163:15.45]It's not gonna work.
[163:30.33]The kick is just... When you think of countering a thrust, a foot is not what you think of.
[163:36.61]You think of a sword or a weapon and I keep thinking I have to dodge it or jump over it.
[163:50.08]Let me thrust you with my foot.
[164:01.11]Okay.
[164:32.69]That didn't stop him.
[165:59.58]What?
[166:37.90]I'm stuck in the fucking wall!
[166:54.45]What the hell?
[166:55.41]What the hell is this?
[167:09.02]Alright, come on, come on, get on.
[167:35.85]My stomach, it cut me!
[167:39.23]Open!
[167:42.15]Fucking hell.
[167:54.90]And I didn't even... I didn't even have the fucking... I didn't even get the drop-down orb removal.
[168:24.91]Fucking... I'm so mad that... Let's just fucking get this motherfucker.
[168:30.21]You know what I'm saying?
[168:32.45]My teeth are clenched.
[168:35.58]You ain't fucking doing this shit again, man.
[169:26.07]Unbearable, unbearable, unbearable pain.
[169:48.14]They just get right up on you so quickly.
[169:51.83]I still have a chance.
[169:52.67]No, I don't.
[170:05.98]Ah, that's a sweep.
[170:10.06]Give me my posture back, please.
[170:33.67]Nope.
[170:37.33]No, no, no.
[170:52.16]This time, let me actually get the dive down, and then it'll be fine.
[170:56.06]It'll be over.
[171:15.61]Is the second phase harder than the first?
[171:16.97]I don't think it is.
[171:17.63]I mean, maybe he adds like a move or two, but I should be able just to get this like this.
[171:21.86]I thought... The fucking goddamn ceiling bump.
[171:26.22]I... Seriously, man.
[171:27.62]Come on.
[171:28.94]What the fuck?
[171:29.90]Just kill me.
[171:47.03]Jump down.
[171:47.59]You saw what happened when I jumped down last time.
[171:49.00]I jumped way over him.
[172:16.81]Where the fuck is he?
[172:27.07]Oh my god.
[172:27.83]I did it like three times in a fucking row and I can't do it.
[172:31.15]Just kill me again.
[172:32.29]I'm like overthinking it.
[172:36.85]Just kill me.
[172:38.21]My god.
[172:40.07]No.
[172:42.41]Hurry off.
[172:43.09]Go.
[172:43.43]Yeah.
[172:43.77]Death.
[172:44.19]I know.
[172:44.58]I can't believe it.
[173:12.09]Wait, what do you mean jump down here?
[173:18.59]Are you fucking kidding me?
[173:21.67]Really?
[173:24.19]Hey, you lied to me!
[173:25.68]You lied to me!
[173:28.50]You lied to me!
[173:34.46]I'm gonna die!
[173:41.21]I'm sorry, I can't mute right now.
[174:06.90]Where am I going?
[174:07.50]I'm going the wrong way.
[174:08.46]I'm so fucking beyond.
[174:11.10]Oh, these mini-bosses are fucking... They're hell.
[174:15.70]They're actual hell.
[174:20.91]They weren't fucking around.
[174:22.35]They really weren't.
[174:26.83]These aren't even bosses.
[174:27.81]These are just guys that are strong.
[174:30.59]And I'm like, I'm getting hyper-tilted.
[174:34.47]by even dropping down on the guy and doing a back stab on him.
[174:40.87]Okay, here we go.
[174:42.14]Somebody says jump.
[174:43.48]I jumped.
[174:44.74]Okay, it's time to die.
[174:47.10]Alright, alright, here we go.
[174:49.34]Quiet on the set, please.
[175:09.61]He just kicked me!
[175:10.83]He kicked me, Mom!
[175:11.83]He kicked me in the face from across the fucking game!
[175:15.59]I'm so mad!
[175:17.76]I'm so angry at the world!
[176:29.06]I'm the best.
[176:30.16]I'm the best.
[176:31.08]You're not the best.
[176:32.46]I'm the best God damn it Magnetic or base material for prosthetic tool upgrades of intermediate and higher rank I
[176:58.97]And another bead.
[177:08.74]This game is something else.
[177:12.68]Hardest goddamn fucking game at Walmart, seriously.
[177:29.78]Okay, how many dies total?
[177:44.88]30?
[177:48.60]Yeah, like I said, that's a $1 scratch ticket.
[177:50.14]Every death is a $1 scratch ticket.
[177:57.52]And we'll see if you guys want to compile them.
[178:00.84]Oh, by the way, if you don't know, I just want to make sure everyone's aware of this.
[178:05.89]Because, I mean, I talked about it last night, late, and this morning.
[178:10.88]Every time I die... And I do have to confirm that this is, like, okay for Twitch terms of service.
[178:17.00]But every time I die, I was gonna buy a $1 scratch ticket.
[178:21.12]Or maybe upgrade them into, like, a bunch of $5 scratch tickets.
[178:25.51]And then scratch them at the end after I beat the game.
[178:27.73]If I do.
[178:28.25]Hopefully I do.
[178:28.87]This game's fucking brutal.
[178:30.63]But...
[178:31.77]Scratch them all, and whatever I get, money-wise, will just be paid community subs.
[178:38.43]Whatever it is.
[178:39.56]I need to make sure that that's, like, okay, though.
[178:49.22]I need to make sure that that's actually, like, not against, like, terms of service somehow.
[178:52.84]So I'm going to confirm that.
[178:58.68]I'm going into, like, a new area here.
[179:05.46]What is that?
[179:05.90]There's like a snake over there or something.
[179:07.28]Or like a toad or a crab?
[179:18.10]There's a sorcerer down there.
[179:20.22]Okay.
[179:23.44]Do I get any means of... Oh, it's just lizards.
[179:29.70]They're really, really, really easy.
[179:40.43]Okay.
[179:42.03]No shrine or anything?
[179:46.70]Of course it is.
[179:47.74]Of course I have to fight this thing.
[179:50.84]I see a shrine down there.
[179:52.94]Can I get there from here?
[179:54.70]Don't alert the boss.
[180:02.69]Can I make this jump?
[180:03.53]Okay.
[180:11.65]Bulging coin!
[180:15.57]Thank God.
[180:16.87]Safety.
[180:26.58]Let's... ...rest here.
[180:31.10]I only have $97.
[180:40.52]I mean, do I dare just see what this is?
[180:48.34]Shichimen Warrior.
[180:50.10]Ah, I just, like, ran into a stop sign.
[180:59.19]Oh, can I deflect these?
[181:02.49]I wonder.
[181:07.45]I don't know what that purple bar is.
[181:19.59]I don't think he does anything besides throw this shit out here.
[181:23.75]Terror.
[181:24.57]Oh, he did.
[181:25.13]I just want to avoid this.
[181:43.71]Dodging it.
[181:44.63]Oh, boy.
[182:00.48]Well, that's what that guy does.
[182:07.13]Maybe illusions, yeah.
[182:10.89]I don't, how many, I think I only have like one, where can I buy snap seeds?
[182:14.09]I only have like one.
[182:16.19]Well, I have one, let's just see what it does.
[182:21.69]Just get up there real quick and start smashing them.
[182:26.87]Watch out for the terror, terror, terror, terror, terror!
[182:28.75]Alright, illusions!
[182:38.76]Looks like it's real.
[182:40.87]Ghosts are real, guys.
[182:41.99]Can I bring him back down?
[182:44.57]Sure can.
[182:50.99]Huh.
[182:57.50]Well, I'm gonna go for... I'll have to see what's up here.
[183:06.61]I unlocked this zone.
[183:07.55]Might as well see what it is.
[183:16.74]Oh, this is like a lady.
[183:18.92]What?
[183:19.20]The depths of Ashina are over there.
[183:42.52]It's the stuff screaming.
[183:46.23]I don't know what's going on out there.
[183:48.11]Maybe like a fucking birthday party.
[183:50.85]I wonder if they got a clown.
[183:54.79]So I can... This is just Bloodborne.
[183:58.33]Yeah, this is just Bloodborne.
[184:06.74]I don't want to do this.
[184:09.80]I feel like I'm going to be stuck there.
[184:12.11]Let me go back.
[184:14.65]You are the clown.
[184:23.37]What do I have here?
[184:26.57]So this was those two mini-bosses.
[184:32.32]I could go back to the reservoir.
[184:33.58]This is the...
[184:42.96]Let's see if there's anything new here.
[184:52.30]Do you have any more info for me?
[184:53.44]I have one of these tears, but I don't know if I can use it yet.
[184:56.41]Oh, here we go.
[184:57.39]Okay.
[184:58.21]Yes.
[184:59.43]I found some answers.
[185:01.13]The source of the dragon rot is the stagnation in your blood.
[185:05.59]What causes the stagnation?
[185:07.63]The blood has only a limited amount of power available to it.
[185:12.29]let's say you've used all of this power and then you attempt to resurrect again the resurrection still occurs but it must draw on power equivalent exchange from those that have the dragon rod I believe so for those who have the dragon rod the natural life force that everyone has that allows them to live their lives and function as human beings
[185:38.30]has been taken from them.
[185:39.90]Their blood has stagnated.
[185:41.70]Can it be cured?
[185:42.92]Yes.
[185:44.11]By giving back what has been taken.
[185:46.73]Here you are.
[185:49.15]Dragon's blood droplet.
[185:51.43]So an item that is really... By the way, I'm going to mute this for a second because I'm going to bring up something.
[185:58.93]We're going to listen here for a second.
[186:00.87]Let me tell you something.
[186:01.53]Ready?
[186:04.31]I want to make a game show and title the game show
[186:09.05]Birds or small children?
[186:14.05]And see who can tell the difference.
[186:21.08]If you listen to this, could you actually tell?
[186:26.14]Because kids... Next time you're in a grocery store and there's a kid being like... They sound like birds.
[186:43.17]That could be like a bird habitat.
[186:48.82]Hold on.
[186:59.85]Oh, the birthday party must have gone inside.
[187:04.56]Yeah, I would have different birds making bird noises and then children outside or children at grocery store and see if anybody could really actually tell the difference.
[187:13.98]Sometimes you can't tell.
[187:14.72]Alright, recovery charm.
[187:27.03]So now I actually have this.
[187:31.78]So you can offer a dragon's blood droplet to a sculptor's adder to restore all afflicted with the dragon rot.
[187:38.98]Alright.
[187:40.22]So I have two of these now, right?
[187:47.49]I thought I had two of them.
[187:48.85]Didn't I buy one of these?
[187:49.71]Oh, there's one in storage, okay.
[187:57.40]Which, what is it now?
[187:57.92]7%.
[187:57.94]Now, I... The question that I have for this, though, is...
[188:27.55]Should I use these now, or should I... I have two.
[188:30.71]I wonder if I should save them, or will people just start dying?
[188:40.20]I feel like this is the weird... FromSoftware catch that's in all these games.
[188:45.80]What do I do with these?
[188:46.66]Should I hold on to them?
[188:50.72]I mean, maybe I could just do it... I have two.
[189:05.39]Dragonrod healed.
[189:10.39]So now I have another one.
[189:15.52]So it heals everybody, not just one person.
[189:18.88]Okay, that's cool.
[189:21.52]What do I got?
[189:22.28]Skills, right?
[189:23.12]I wanted to... This is five.
[189:26.46]How about down here?
[189:35.48]Ichimanji Double.
[189:38.00]Adds a follow-up overhead sword strike to Ichimanji, deals high posture damage, and also recovers one's own posture.
[189:45.06]The follow-up attack is especially useful for preventing enemy counterattacks.
[189:51.07]Yeah, it's just a much better version of this.
[189:57.87]Hmm.
[189:59.27]I want this one, though.
[190:01.29]I'm gonna get this one first.
[190:08.74]Alright.
[190:10.14]Now the real question of the evening here.
[190:13.74]Is where the fuck do I go now?
[190:16.52]That's a great question.
[190:20.80]A bottle of sake given by Emma.
[190:28.23]Sake is a drink meant for sharing.
[190:30.17]Doesn't contain water from the fountain.
[190:31.49]It is made from the purest of waters.
[190:33.41]And is a drink beloved by the people.
[190:34.73]Now I want some fucking drink.
[190:37.99]Get drunk.
[190:38.43]Give drink.
[190:41.16]Wait, you just... Oh, he just gave... Oh, okay.
[190:43.38]Okay.
[191:01.91]Maybe I'll make my own, like, brewed up fucking sake.
[191:04.17]Don't drink alcohol, you're sick.
[191:05.43]No, I'm not sick.
[191:06.57]I just have this lingering... I feel better.
[191:30.31]Trying to justify it.
[191:31.97]I feel great.
[191:32.59]Maybe it'll make me play better.
[191:33.95]You know, wait, we're done here.
[191:57.34]Wait, so I have the Ashina sake, I have this unrefined shit.
[192:01.22]So this is a case of, let me take the product from over there, give this guy the unrefined dog shit one, and then keep the one for myself and sell it.
[192:10.26]Which one?
[192:15.62]I wonder if this opens up something else.
[192:20.28]Take the good one.
[192:21.20]I brought some tea.
[192:24.16]Tea smells pretty good.
[192:26.02]Suppose I'll have some.
[192:27.66]Mix them together.
[192:31.67]Oh, I needed that.
[192:32.91]I like want one of those now.
[192:35.73]About Lady Emma's father.
[192:37.05]What?
[192:37.43]Dogen.
[192:38.78]He was an extraordinary doctor.
[192:41.08]He drank Emma's father used to pee in a cup?
[192:46.06]Better put, he was obsessed with mechanisms.
[192:49.38]This tastes just like Emma's father's pee.
[192:51.69]That's my favorite pee.
[192:53.99]But I owed him my life.
[192:56.77]And we could say that you owe him your life as well.
[193:00.69]I tell ya, it's too easy sometimes.
[193:21.78]What?
[193:22.48]He told me I needed to practice with the prosthetic in order to use it properly, so Emma would pester me into carving her spinning tops and other toys.
[193:33.58]After much training of that sort, it came to be called a shinobi fang.
[193:40.22]In other words, that prosthetic arm is Dogen's legacy.
[193:45.71]His legacy?
[193:53.18]so much time has passed while I have abandoned my shinobi ways that alone I could not bear to abandon okay so no matter what I do any buddhas is the fate of those who owe a deep karmic debt you'll understand when you try carving one for yourself so
[194:21.19]Okay, ask about alarm, alright.
[194:24.23]Purifying agents.
[194:26.59]Purifying agents.
[194:27.71]What about the unrefined one?
[194:30.36]Should I just give this to him?
[194:31.64]Or do I, can I, this is for a different...
[194:50.63]I wonder if you should just take this.
[194:53.41]Here, just take it.
[194:59.31]I brought some sake.
[195:00.65]Don't mind if I do.
[195:05.82]Oh, Spencer!
[195:06.92]Spencer, I got a question for you.
[195:08.08]Is it not tear-liking?
[195:09.90]No, it's damn good.
[195:15.33]Oh, you have no idea.
[195:16.39]Okay.
[195:17.03]You did it for my sake.
[195:19.90]Oh.
[195:47.79]I was on the verge of being consumed.
[195:50.65]Consumed by what?
[195:52.31]Shura.
[195:59.42]Well, they're talking about sake.
[196:01.58]Come on.
[196:03.62]I thought he, like, cut his arm off to get his secret Krabby Patty sake recipe.
[196:07.46]I don't know.
[196:22.82]okay I hope you enjoyed that sake I'm glad you've come alright I don't have any seeds so what do I need to do now look at that bad bad game design bad game design look at that blurry like bug patch right there bad game development game dev
[196:50.27]No, never mind.
[196:50.91]Alright, I've wasted enough time.
[197:04.64]Bottomless hole?
[197:05.38]I don't think there's anywhere else I can go.
[197:07.53]Let me go back here.
[197:19.22]Let's take a look.
[197:19.68]So this is the reservoir.
[197:20.94]No, that boss was up there.
[197:26.72]He's dead.
[197:32.72]I feel like there was another place to go.
[197:40.86]Wasn't there?
[197:41.26]This is the castle.
[197:48.19]Yeah, hold on, let me go back out.
[197:50.79]There was that spot up the stairs.
[197:53.93]Hold on.
[197:54.92]Yeah, right here.
[197:57.12]Up this way.
[198:06.78]I'm no lawyer, man, but I just read the terms of service and I feel like scratch cards are okay.
[198:11.65]But, here's another thing though, not just scratch cards.
[198:16.84]But whatever money is won off the scratch cards, I buy a bunch of community subs with that.
[198:24.81]That's a weird roundabout thing.
[198:26.59]I gotta ask.
[198:28.15]Maybe.
[198:31.77]Or it could just be to charity, too.
[198:38.36]Charity?
[198:38.64]Yeah, that's a good idea as well.
[198:46.68]Let's rest here, and then I'm going to take a look up the stairs.
[198:58.74]So there's that.
[198:59.42]Let me just see what's up this way.
[199:01.63]There's a... I could go this way.
[199:04.33]Let's check over here.
[199:11.31]No, I mean, I've been...
[199:15.99]I hate this game, I've been pretending this whole time.
[199:19.99]I'll probably see you guys tomorrow.
[199:41.88]No, no, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog in the stairs!
[199:51.56]That was perfectly executed.
[200:10.33]Oh, what hit me?
[200:15.10]Oh, you're... You have homing boomerang devices?
[200:19.22]What the hell are those?
[200:21.91]He's actually curving bullets at me!
[200:40.33]Is that it?
[200:46.41]Clear the area and then I'm gonna take a little exploration.
[200:48.79]What's in there?
[200:52.32]Oh boy, this goes up high.
[200:55.09]Hold on.
[200:57.27]Oh, um... Hmm... This stuff down here... I don't really want to just miss everything.
[201:14.30]Wait, just wait.
[201:15.02]Hold on.
[201:15.46]I need to...
[201:17.27]Yeah, I'm gonna slow this down.
[201:18.63]I don't want to just jump across.
[201:19.79]Let me just... Yeah, see this is what I want to do.
[201:24.05]Come over here.
[201:27.52]What did that incense pot do to me?
[201:28.94]You ever have an incense pot in your house?
[201:36.22]It's just, it's overpowering sometimes.
[201:46.05]This looks like the only way to go.
[201:50.13]It's a fire hazard.
[201:53.09]What the fuck?
[201:55.31]That's insane.
[202:24.60]Any more?
[202:25.30]I feel like this probably items are missing.
[202:28.22]Yeah, like over there.
[202:32.84]Security cameras.
[202:34.56]Look at this.
[202:34.82]There's like four security cameras right there.
[202:36.68]Right where my head is right now.
[202:37.68]See that?
[202:39.00]They'll get alerted.
[202:51.71]Alright, I gotta get across.
[203:00.00]Okay.
[203:31.01]Whatever.
[203:31.29]Alright, let me try.
[203:34.89]Can I jump from here and grab that?
[203:42.36]Balloon of wealth.
[203:42.96]I gotta use these, too.
[203:44.06]I have so many.
[203:44.72]Whoa, whoa.
[203:45.22]Who's looking?
[203:45.78]Who sees?
[203:47.38]Who sees me?
[203:54.11]Uh...
[204:00.49]Did I just backstab this guy?
[204:03.21]No, there's like five people here.
[204:04.51]That's a mistake.
[204:09.47]Vendor or something down there?
[204:14.74]Who are you?
[204:15.12]Hmm.
[204:15.78]But aren't you on the enemy team, maybe?
[204:18.06]Maybe I should say, yep.
[204:32.92]That's right.
[204:33.58]I thought so.
[204:36.42]In that case, say you didn't take care of some of the samurai around here.
[204:41.07]Some unfortunate things happened.
[204:43.97]And now they're after me day and night.
[204:46.35]I'm at the end of my rope here.
[204:48.73]I'm going to get a quest.
[204:50.07]You'd think they'd have bigger things to worry about than chasing after me anyway.
[204:57.38]So, selling info.
[204:57.92]Sure.
[204:58.22]How many do I have to kill?
[205:00.04]Do you have a number in mind?
[205:01.62]Or all of them?
[205:29.81]Just one.
[205:31.57]See ya later!
[205:41.68]Alright, I did it.
[205:45.04]Where's my info?
[205:48.50]Maybe I should get rid of all of them.
[205:52.66]Any more down here?
[206:00.91]Nope.
[206:01.93]Alright, I'll take that info, please.
[206:11.25]Take care of those shinobi, and I'll give you some info.
[206:20.23]Beacon memo.
[206:21.01]A note on smoke signals used by Ashina Shinobi, the Gray Night Jars.
[206:26.15]Pale pink smoke signals are placed along the rooftops of Ashina Castle.
[206:31.50]These signals guide the nightjar.
[206:34.12]The ashen feathered flock are surely the only ones able to follow such a trail.
[206:38.28]So the stuff, the burning incense stuff.
[206:43.39]Okay, so...
[206:59.58]Any more dialog?
[207:02.16]Okay.
[207:04.26]Well, that means, yes, I'll see you soon.
[207:06.19]Alright, so the smoke thing is on the top.
[207:11.17]I think it requires some investigating.
[207:12.77]There's one of those weird bird boomerangs up there.
[207:17.79]Item?
[207:26.18]Item?
[207:32.32]Yeah, where there's smoke, there's fire, you know what I mean?
[207:36.60]This one.
[207:37.74]Ooh, there's an item right here.
[207:52.51]I bet I have, like, 500 of those.
[208:04.62]Okay.
[208:10.80]I just don't even use him.
[208:16.32]Hey, sup?
[208:19.52]Okay, here we are.
[208:24.82]Anything else?
[208:30.60]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[208:31.98]I just fell down.
[208:34.89]No, come on, stop being so sloppy with this.
[208:37.05]Alright, up.
[208:51.06]There really is cameras.
[208:51.78]Oh, no, it's not.
[209:24.82]These guys are a pain.
[209:30.80]I'm not supposed to use it.
[209:33.96]Up there?
[209:34.68]No.
[209:37.16]This way.
[209:42.96]What the fuck?!
[209:51.45]Gonzo the Great just shot out of a cannon at me!
[209:56.82]Oh my god!
[210:12.42]Come on, Kermit!
[210:24.67]You got gnomed in the game.
[210:31.96]Why is an item this way?
[210:41.51]Um, um, uh-oh.
[210:43.79]Uh-oh, this was not a good idea.
[211:09.67]Oh my god, the whole baseball team is here.
[211:24.86]What the fuck?
[211:25.58]Oh, there's a bad guy!
[211:33.71]Okay, let's approach this differently.
[211:38.57]I gotta get back up here.
[211:40.05]Can I reach this from here?
[211:41.05]No.
[211:44.23]That was insane.
[211:45.29]I gotta go back the other way.
[211:46.19]I actually just jumped off the building.
[211:49.24]Just jumped off of the building and didn't care.
[211:51.20]I'm gonna wrap back around.
[212:07.79]Alright.
[212:09.23]Geez.
[212:22.38]They're all just standing here!
[212:26.66]They were waiting for me!
[212:28.71]They're all waiting for me!
[212:45.14]Oh, fuck!
[212:46.12]Oh, shit!
[212:49.28]Why?
[212:54.18]Come on, you, you, you, now!
[213:12.78]No, fuck, there's too many!
[213:19.36]That's too many!
[213:20.14]This is too many.
[213:20.90]It's five people!
[213:24.09]Fuck!
[213:34.53]Turn the corner and they're just all waiting for me.
[213:36.61]Four of them.
[213:38.53]Just waiting for me.
[213:42.65]At least I know where I'm going.
[213:43.53]Although I have to deal with all those people again.
[213:45.27]And this... I probably was so close to some form of...
[213:50.15]God damn it.
[213:57.56]Sorry.
[213:58.30]Whatever.
[214:12.41]Where are you going, man?
[214:21.53]Baseball teams thrive on rooftops.
[214:23.53]That's what I'm saying.
[214:33.48]Did you just see that?
[214:34.18]Why did my character freeze?
[214:35.30]Now I'm just rushing.
[214:53.90]Alright.
[214:56.51]This time, I gotta... Watch out for Gonzo.
[214:59.53]Gonzo's up here.
[215:24.82]Oh no, there's another one.
[215:25.67]Oh my god, I didn't make the... oh my god.
[215:37.62]This guy had to die, he was just down here.
[216:11.62]Okay, not this time.
[216:22.63]Phew!
[216:23.03]Alright.
[216:25.97]Come on, Gonzo.
[216:42.19]Okay, so I have one heal left and a resurrect.
[216:47.56]So let me see how the fuck I approach this.
[216:55.84]I've got two pellets.
[216:57.28]Alright.
[216:57.68]There's one there.
[217:03.41]See, I went this way.
[217:04.35]Maybe if I just hug this wall.
[217:07.59]Can I go down?
[217:08.21]Maybe I can go down a level.
[217:13.08]No, let me put on some shit.
[217:14.40]Let's throw the cans.
[217:18.78]Dermalight about Minecraft VR.
[217:20.14]Thanks for the five community subs.
[217:22.22]Welcome, subs!
[217:24.23]Thank you.
[217:25.43]Dermalight about Minecraft.
[217:31.41]For your five subs.
[217:33.11]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[217:40.08]I wonder if there's the only one there...
[217:47.52]Is there one down here?
[217:48.36]I don't think there's one over here.
[217:59.36]Maybe I don't... Lizard.
[218:08.57]I guess I'm going to try down here.
[218:18.12]I hear something walking.
[218:33.28]Oh.
[218:36.08]Poison, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[218:41.73]Is anything down here?
[218:48.51]No, just lizards.
[218:58.78]That's where I fought Spear Guy.
[219:00.42]There's a body of water over here.
[219:11.42]Nothing to jump to.
[219:14.53]I guess I'm gonna...
[219:23.42]Guess I'm gonna go for it.
[219:30.53]What is that?
[219:51.07]Doesn't open from this side.
[219:52.23]Shit!
[219:56.40]Oh, there's people there.
[220:00.26]Hold tight.
[220:00.62]Hold on.
[220:06.67]I am lost.
[220:09.21]Oh, there's spear wizards.
[220:10.91]There is a bonfire right there.
[220:34.23]Going first.
[220:42.75]Made it.
[220:45.05]Nice.
[220:50.42]Oh, where?
[220:51.06]I don't even know where I ended up.
[221:00.82]So where is this?
[221:02.90]So this is Old Grave?
[221:11.36]Hmm.
[221:12.00]What about this way?
[221:19.95]Well, that's another Dragon Root Heal.
[221:29.57]Cool.
[221:31.71]Item up there.
[221:36.53]Grave robber.
[221:44.36]Another sugar.
[221:45.02]So this is the stealth sugar.
[221:48.29]Let's just take a look.
[221:52.91]I gotta pee, but I'm curious about this area.
[222:01.87]Hey, you didn't see a little scoundrel come running through here, did you?
[222:05.23]We're after one, and I'm fairly sure he came this way.
[222:07.77]Hmm.
[222:08.79]What was he wearing?
[222:09.92]He had a black hat on.
[222:11.04]Short little guy.
[222:11.78]Black hat?
[222:12.28]I don't have one.
[222:12.70]The thing is, nobody's passed this way at all.
[222:15.18]The only thing that did look like some kind of animal.
[222:18.44]A raccoon?
[222:19.48]Maybe a badger?
[222:21.22]Couldn't say for sure.
[222:22.76]You sure you didn't mistake that animal for your criminal?
[222:25.63]Aw, come on!
[222:26.91]Ah, forget it.
[222:42.45]Mistake this.
[222:52.79]Oh, fuck it.
[222:53.27]Let's just go.
[222:53.69]Come on.
[223:04.46]Anything else?
[223:07.06]Nope.
[223:13.44]A lot of items here, though.
[223:15.81]Oh.
[223:17.19]Bald guy.
[223:19.37]Bald guy.
[223:21.69]Cannon guy.
[223:23.63]Whoa, who?
[223:25.21]Who saw me?
[223:27.99]The guy with the cannon saw me?
[223:30.65]I guess.
[223:32.05]Well, let's just pull this guy down.
[223:35.71]Oh, it's a pan guy!
[223:38.32]Ugh.
[223:45.59]Of course the guy with the fucking pan sees me.
[223:47.41]Yeah, well I got everything there.
[224:05.82]Is that not- I can't grab up there?
[224:08.06]Should be able to, right?
[224:23.47]I gotta just... Oh, I just got denied.
[224:33.08]And I got shot on the ground.
[224:37.55]Wow!
[224:38.29]I didn't even...
[224:52.33]I just got so denied.
[224:54.67]You gotta go first.
[225:08.48]Alright, now let's not try to get disrespected again.
[225:28.02]Fuck you.
[225:30.57]Not fair.
[225:31.47]Come on.
[225:34.25]Why can't you hurt yourself with that shit?
[225:54.40]I can't get him.
[225:56.14]I can't get him.
[226:05.51]Is he reloading?
[226:06.43]Alright.
[226:09.56]That guy was a pain in the ass.
[226:33.83]He shot so many times.
[226:35.96]And he had to reload his gun.
[226:41.26]That brings us to here.
[226:43.10]Nothing else I'm missing.
[226:44.40]No.
[226:45.04]But... Yes.
[226:46.12]Because I want to get that.
[226:52.69]Come on.
[226:52.97]I can't reach from here.
[226:57.35]Yeah, I can.
[227:00.09]There's a hole in this roof.
[227:01.95]Jeremy.
[227:02.21]Jeremy.
[227:04.88]Jeremy?
[227:06.74]Okay.
[227:12.04]More sugar.
[227:13.38]NPC?
[227:18.31]Uh...
[227:29.15]Told those morons to give it a rest.
[227:31.87]But they don't.
[227:33.05]They just keep sending more.
[227:35.47]Such a pain in my, huh?
[227:38.15]You one of them Nightjar cronies?
[227:40.29]No.
[227:41.35]Ah, of course not.
[227:42.79]There's something different about you.
[227:45.65]But I'd say you're in the same line of work.
[227:47.79]This is my favorite character.
[227:48.68]Name's Black Eyed Badger.
[227:50.34]What's yours?
[227:53.22]I don't know.
[227:53.76]Bender.
[227:54.58]Ooh, bite down on your controller.
[228:24.08]Secret Shinobi drug.
[228:26.16]When times call for death by one's own hand, samurai turn their swords on themselves as a matter of pride, while Shinobi demand a swifter means.
[228:34.63]Simply crush in the back teeth to die.
[228:38.58]Nothing more is required.
[228:41.40]Resurrection is not limited after use.
[228:47.57]Why would I want these?
[228:52.32]Resurrection is not limited after use, so what?
[228:54.16]I... This is the attack candy, but these iron fortress... Can be fit into the shinobi prosthetic, become a working prosthetic tool.
[229:14.77]Experienced iron-ribbed fan users can deflect arrows and even bullets using this tool.
[229:21.55]Ooh.
[229:29.36]It wouldn't be surprising if the next owner decided to wait was impractical.
[229:33.74]So it's just a giant metal shield to block from arrows and bullets.
[229:37.44]Okay, what about this?
[229:39.72]Anti-air... It's a shinobi martial art.
[229:41.93]Anti-air death blow.
[229:44.57]A technique which serves the shinobi who is not bound by the Earth in battle.
[229:48.17]Leap towards an opponent who has exposed himself in mid-air and strike, killing him before he hits the ground.
[229:58.63]Huh, okay.
[229:59.59]Well, I got money.
[230:00.43]I got coin bags.
[230:10.73]How many do I have?
[230:16.16]How much is this?
[230:16.68]Is this a thousand?
[230:23.68]I would assume this is at least $7.50.
[230:28.26]I could get them both.
[230:31.68]Thousand, okay.
[230:32.64]So that's, how much is it total for everything?
[230:34.20]So this is the anti-air death blow.
[230:43.59]Let me try it.
[230:44.85]And then it's another 1,600.
[230:45.57]Yep, and then, so I need, I need 1,350.
[230:50.87]I got 250, so I need 1,100.
[231:17.76]No, the light ones are not that much.
[231:20.14]Never mind.
[231:20.64]For some reason, I don't know why I thought that was going to be $500.
[231:35.22]So that's 13.
[231:35.56]That's 16.
[231:36.46]Okay.
[231:39.19]Should I get all the three?
[231:46.69]Should I get these three of them?
[231:49.02]Yeah, fuck it.
[231:49.34]Let's just buy them.
[232:07.25]so long yeah I gotta spend the money somewhere okay so that leaves me with I have to go learn the skill right and it's a prosthetic thanks guy anything else to say
[232:28.84]Hear about this one?
[232:30.14]Rats have been swarming into Ashina Castle these days.
[232:33.20]You know the ones I mean.
[232:34.62]But there's this hell-bent old-timer cutting them up like it was nothing.
[232:41.37]Oh.
[232:42.75]I know who that is.
[232:44.85]I know.
[232:46.89]Was he wearing a tengu mask?
[232:49.68]See, I killed for him.
[232:52.22]It was a quest.
[232:53.08]Who spoke?
[232:56.49]I hadn't heard.
[232:57.29]Yeah, I saw it.
[232:58.76]I knew it.
[232:59.16]I knew it.
[232:59.58]I knew it.
[233:03.88]I know.
[233:04.04]I know.
[233:04.20]So long.
[233:05.38]Okay.
[233:05.60]Okay.
[233:21.47]So I gotta be getting close to some kind of a door or something.
[233:25.21]A door or a new area or something, right?
[233:37.46]Yeah, so there's a... There we go.
[233:43.12]Here's the door.
[233:45.36]Let's go fit this shit.
[233:47.66]Wait.
[233:49.86]Let me just make sure I didn't... There's nothing else down there, right?
[233:52.74]Just that guy and then over this way.
[233:56.72]So go down to the right next time.
[234:01.59]Can I go this way?
[234:02.21]Let me just see what's over here.
[234:05.37]No, not really.
[234:09.73]Let me fit the prosthetic and... I gotta pee, too.
[234:14.50]I have not peed in four hours.
[234:15.70]It's kind of remarkable.
[234:25.84]We must go to the new area.
[234:27.50]I still uh... Come here.
[234:41.47]Fit new prosthetic tool.
[234:44.66]Loaded umbrella.
[234:49.59]Uh-huh.
[234:50.55]Iron-ripped umbrella to the arm costs spirit emblems to use.
[234:54.29]When spread open, it will protect against all attacks from all directions.
[234:59.05]Hold it out while moving to protect from light attacks.
[235:02.30]But this is an umbrella after all.
[235:03.88]It won't protect you from low attacks such as sweeps.
[235:09.10]Oh, shit.
[235:09.52]Really?
[235:09.78]Okay.
[235:16.98]Just want to see if it was on the...
[235:21.24]Let's test it out.
[235:23.29]Yeah, light attacks.
[235:24.69]Not all of them, yeah.
[235:27.47]What do I replace in here?
[235:28.43]Probably this.
[235:29.95]Loaded umbrella and... I like this.
[235:34.00]Let's see.
[235:34.92]Loaded umbrella.
[235:35.46]Cool.
[235:37.12]Now, I also have... Let's go to skills.
[235:39.34]Let me see what that looks like.
[235:41.80]I'm gonna pee my pants, fuck.
[235:50.41]I have enough to do what I wanted to do for this.
[235:57.43]But what was that skill?
[236:03.74]Anti-air death blow.
[236:05.70]It's a shinobi martial art.
[236:13.22]So is it just in here somewhere that I... Or do I just have it now?
[236:24.88]Is it one of these?
[236:26.74]You just have it, okay.
[236:29.30]Alright, I gotta pee.
[236:30.80]I'll be right back.
[236:33.49]See you in two seconds.
[236:34.31]Well, two minutes.
[239:47.01]I'm back.
[239:58.68]Good to go.
[240:02.60]What are you linking me here?
[240:05.49]It's the Mickey Mouse hat.
[240:19.05]That's fucking funny.
[240:21.41]Just sad.
[240:26.92]Just a sad boy trying to get through Sekiro.
[240:32.22]No, we're good.
[240:36.04]Oswald hat.
[240:36.72]Yeah, that's true.
[240:37.42]That's not Mickey Mouse.
[240:38.20]That is Oswald.
[240:38.86]You're right.
[240:42.12]Please correct me because I was speaking complete not-truths.
[240:47.52]Alrighty.
[240:49.80]From here... So I already have the skill.
[240:58.15]Which is... How do I do it, though?
[241:04.21]Do I... Is there a way... Can I... Does it just happen?
[241:15.24]Maybe I should train.
[241:25.20]Yeah, let's go visit the guy.
[241:26.04]We haven't seen this guy in a while.
[241:28.24]Oh.
[241:29.17]Speaking of people we haven't seen.
[241:30.85]There's... Well, alright.
[241:32.01]This is... I finally have somebody in the town to sell to.
[241:35.09]Uh, hi, King.
[241:35.35]Ten community subs.
[241:55.92]Thank you, milk, for your 10 community subs.
[242:01.02]The king of all milk.
[242:06.98]Ooh, finally.
[242:09.68]Yes, pellets.
[242:12.08]A seed!
[242:12.84]A gourd seed!
[242:13.40]Do I have enough to buy this?
[242:14.84]I might.
[242:20.92]Five?
[242:21.40]I do!
[242:22.32]No, I don't.
[242:22.80]That's a thousand.
[242:26.14]Shit, I don't have enough.
[242:28.34]What about selling?
[242:30.26]Is there anything here that I don't care about?
[242:35.24]No.
[242:39.18]There they go.
[242:47.83]The two coin purses will only get me to a thousand.
[242:51.45]And I need two thousand.
[242:54.71]What does this do?
[242:58.84]I don't know.
[242:59.78]Who knows?
[243:03.63]Pellet.
[243:06.01]Well, at least I have a place to actually buy and sell things.
[243:15.07]So that puts us in a position to... Right, I want to go talk to this guy.
[243:23.79]We haven't been up here in a while.
[243:26.71]I thought he was on fire for a second.
[243:28.90]Training.
[243:29.50]We already did these.
[243:30.98]Anything new?
[243:32.98]Yeah, we already... What about the box?
[243:34.18]Nothing in the box.
[243:37.08]Let's take a look at this one more time.
[243:59.58]Anti-air deathblow.
[244:02.48]So looking for anti-air deathblow in the skills menu.
[244:08.27]There it is.
[244:09.85]Okay.
[244:12.55]So it's just here.
[244:16.33]Right trigger near an enemy high up in the air.
[244:19.99]So it's a deathblow if they're in the air only, okay.
[244:28.43]I think it's time for me to go.
[244:30.05]So, where was I going?
[244:35.27]The old grave is where I was.
[244:39.44]And the bottomless hole.
[244:43.82]I'm gonna go just back to the old grave.
[244:50.46]End of the stream?
[244:51.14]No, I ain't stopping for a while.
[244:58.23]Okay, so let's see.
[244:59.68]I already did everything down there.
[245:07.96]Which leads us back this way, maybe?
[245:11.50]There's that general out here.
[245:13.89]I did kind of just speed through that area.
[245:22.39]What about over here?
[245:22.93]Did I already look through here?
[245:27.29]Yeah, that's what the grave was.
[245:28.21]Maybe, like, just take a peek out here.
[245:44.87]I don't think so.
[245:47.39]Remember I... I could not even fucking... I couldn't kill these guys.
[246:00.39]It's so weird just how you see how you progress through these games.
[246:06.10]I couldn't even attempt to fight those guys yesterday.
[246:08.92]Alright, so we got... Let's go this way.
[246:14.74]Cross the bridge.
[246:23.11]Eavesdropped.
[246:30.30]I do.
[246:30.78]I'm streaming secure.
[246:32.00]Salt.
[246:58.22]Who's the bigger threat?
[247:00.60]I don't know.
[247:03.88]This guy.
[247:05.14]His sword is big.
[247:06.62]Into the lake.
[247:33.12]I know.
[247:33.56]I'm going to regret not ever using one of these.
[247:35.72]Alright.
[247:41.48]Well, there is tall grass here to hide in.
[247:45.73]Something just fell from a tree.
[247:49.69]What are they?
[247:50.15]I don't know what they are.
[247:54.54]Is it people?
[247:55.38]Is it bugs?
[247:56.66]Blizzards?
[248:01.23]What?
[248:03.23]Is it gonna dash?
[248:05.27]What is it?
[248:05.67]It's a monkey!
[248:38.39]That was funny.
[248:45.25]They're not that dangerous.
[248:46.07]Let's see if there's anything else over here.
[248:49.35]Can I get on top of the trees?
[248:51.27]Makes sense, right?
[248:54.54]That sounded like me screaming.
[249:05.36]I'm a monster.
[249:06.40]Why?
[249:06.76]I'm being attacked.
[249:13.31]I'm being... swarmed.
[249:15.38]That didn't feel good.
[249:24.14]That felt bad.
[249:24.86]That was unnecessary.
[249:39.71]Anything else besides, like, chimpanzees?
[249:44.07]I think I'm good.
[249:48.11]But I'm gonna be cautious still.
[249:53.95]Uh... Alright.
[249:56.86]Uh, just a house.
[249:59.86]Anything inside of the house?
[250:01.12]That's a real question.
[250:09.79]Those balloons of spirit.
[250:16.25]Well, here we go.
[250:22.07]Always triple check.
[250:22.90]Uh-huh.
[250:26.24]Uh-huh.
[250:45.60]That leads us to here.
[250:52.50]Can I make this jump?
[250:55.14]I don't know.
[250:56.90]Maybe.
[250:57.16]I guess so, yeah.
[251:04.03]Ooh, shit.
[251:05.81]Um... What is down this way?
[251:12.35]Have I already gotten this?
[251:17.46]No.
[251:29.04]That is an item.
[251:32.87]Sunken Valley.
[251:34.93]Uh, I... I was on my way... This looks like another area.
[251:45.67]This is a new area.
[251:48.60]So Sunken Valley is down that way.
[251:50.06]I gotta remember that.
[251:52.44]Uh, I'm just gonna teleport back up to there.
[251:55.72]Wait, what about over here?
[251:58.13]God damn it.
[251:58.63]I mean, I kinda have to.
[251:59.59]Let me just see what's over here.
[252:11.85]Shit.
[252:12.58]That's quick.
[252:13.94]He's got a gun on top of that.
[252:18.27]Wow, that's a pretty cool weapon.
[252:23.79]That's a Bloodborne weapon.
[252:30.61]Well, I can go this way.
[252:33.90]Um... So many paths to choose from, I don't know which one to go through.
[252:52.44]I could go over here, I guess.
[252:59.07]Through the mist.
[253:01.99]Snowy.
[253:06.15]The outskirts.
[253:15.92]This looks like an area where you fight a guy like that.
[253:21.86]I don't know if this is a boss though.
[253:41.19]Cray slaughtered.
[253:50.08]What?
[253:53.12]Just a free prayer bead.
[253:59.10]And a pacifying agent.
[254:03.16]Okay, so it reduces terror buildup.
[254:12.19]It's just like a, that's cool.
[254:13.23]And there's like a little pond.
[254:19.87]Alright.
[254:21.57]Drink from pond.
[254:31.16]There's another one right here.
[254:35.50]They tried to be sneaky and hide it behind the ice.
[254:38.33]Another pacifying agent, okay.
[254:41.53]Cool.
[254:54.86]That's a cool little spot.
[254:57.56]I'll just take- I'll take the prayer bead.
[254:59.90]It's very useful.
[255:02.27]Nice.
[255:11.14]What was that guy doing down here?
[255:12.20]He was just like sharpening his wooden stick.
[255:32.25]I killed him for literally no reason.
[255:35.06]Well, I did kill him for a reason.
[255:36.68]Because if I didn't kill him, he was going to try to kill me.
[255:39.92]I preemptively killed that guy.
[255:42.02]To protect myself.
[255:46.41]Which leads to this way.
[255:49.67]Back to the... Um...
[256:00.41]Alright, now I can go down.
[256:02.27]That's okay.
[256:02.61]Sunken Valley down here, or I'm going to go back to that other teleporter that I just unlocked.
[256:11.92]And which one was it?
[256:17.48]This one right here.
[256:22.68]Jerma, can you play Minecraft now?
[256:24.18]Thanks in advance.
[256:28.43]Um, no.
[256:30.01]I'm not gonna play Minecraft.
[256:33.36]Sorry in advance.
[256:42.26]Eel Liver.
[256:46.61]Greatly reduces the amount of damage received from lightning attacks as well as shock status abnormality.
[256:58.47]Okay.
[256:59.65]Is there nothing else I can do over here?
[257:00.99]Hmm.
[257:16.70]Yeah, this brings me just back down to, like, Sunken Valley.
[257:21.11]Was there somewhere I missed behind?
[257:23.15]Maybe.
[257:23.47]I feel like I didn't get to the end of that last exploration over here.
[257:37.99]Uh-oh.
[257:38.41]Uh-oh.
[257:38.77]Uh-oh.
[257:39.01]Uh-oh.
[257:39.31]I'm gonna... Let me just turn around.
[257:59.72]Because... When the Gauntlets of the Great was flying down, I didn't keep going that way.
[258:07.15]I went down.
[258:09.61]So, if that's the case, then I should come back out here and go back up, right?
[258:15.01]Not this one.
[258:15.41]Which one was it?
[258:19.54]Is this the closest one?
[258:20.50]If I come out and go back around?
[258:21.66]I think it is.
[258:22.08]We'll find out in a second, won't we?
[258:31.79]Damn it.
[258:51.18]Okay, now... This way, and then... Is this the way?
[259:01.15]This is the monkeys, right?
[259:02.95]The monkeys move that way.
[259:04.99]Okay.
[259:12.21]Is there another way I could go from the monkey path?
[259:15.75]Because I went down from here.
[259:17.13]I wonder if I can go up or over here.
[259:22.57]Yeah, okay, so I went down this way.
[259:25.97]Can I do anything up here?
[259:32.52]No, hold on.
[259:35.50]Does this just take me back down to where I was?
[259:44.72]Hmm.
[259:47.78]I... Yeah, this is just a trine.
[259:49.90]Nah, I gotta go back the other way.
[259:50.92]Raid?
[259:51.36]A raid just came in?
[259:56.64]Massive raid?
[259:59.20]A huge raid.
[260:00.76]Hold on, I've got chimpanzees fighting me.
[260:07.63]Dan's gaming raid?
[260:10.13]Holy shit.
[260:11.97]Alright, hold on.
[260:12.41]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[260:15.12]I can't embarrass myself right now.
[260:16.54]Oh.
[260:25.89]What is it?
[260:29.69]No, that is real.
[260:30.69]Dan's Gaming, 2100.
[260:33.00]Thank you so much for the raid.
[260:37.16]That's, uh, welcome guys.
[260:41.52]Hope you had a good stream.
[260:47.54]I'm not sure if, uh... I'm not sure if Dan is also doing... you know, secure.
[260:54.72]Hopefully you're doing well.
[261:00.91]I'm struggling a bit, but it's fantastic so far.
[261:05.77]Welcome to the stream.
[261:07.51]As I try to climb, uh, walls you can't actually climb.
[261:11.93]Now I'm like nervous!
[261:13.49]Oh shit!
[261:14.95]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[261:16.31]Look, I'll show you how much of a gamer I am, I promise.
[261:22.24]So, where was I?
[261:23.18]Over here?
[261:28.78]Look at this idiot.
[261:30.70]Can I do that?
[261:31.42]Just wait.
[261:33.85]I promise, I'm pretty good at parrying.
[261:36.73]I can dodge, I can block.
[261:41.97]But, hi.
[261:42.91]Regardless.
[261:43.65]I think I've made it.
[261:44.40]Did I make it to the right spot?
[261:47.66]I gotta get back up.
[261:51.30]Can't open that door.
[261:54.16]Because this is... How did I get over here?
[261:58.06]It was over here, right?
[262:01.36]I'm lost.
[262:03.62]Hey, welcome to the stream!
[262:05.40]I'm also sick, too.
[262:07.98]What about through here?
[262:14.20]Yeah, I have a cough too, so if you're wondering, I'm fairly sick at the moment.
[262:20.94]I'm gonna go back to where I know where I was going.
[262:24.94]That's probably a better idea.
[262:25.70]Does the castle... Because this is where the stairs leading up to that guy with the... And if I keep going up this way...
[262:45.51]Yeah, right.
[262:45.99]Okay, so here we are.
[262:47.75]I didn't deal with this yet, but this is the way to go up, and this is where Gonzo the Great comes in.
[262:52.98]And then from Gonzo the Great... Alright, I gotta fight, though.
[262:56.36]Just... Wait, wait, wait, what's that?
[262:57.94]Item.
[263:08.29]Worth... I'm glad I saw that.
[263:09.71]I wouldn't have got that at all.
[263:12.53]Is that an item?
[263:14.01]Okay.
[263:23.26]Oh, shit, I can't open this.
[263:31.21]Thank you, Frility.
[263:32.95]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[263:38.89]Coming in with big subs.
[263:39.75]Thank you so much.
[263:42.97]Alright, let's do this again.
[263:43.87]That's probably a better place for me to jump up right here.
[263:48.92]Thank you for the 10 subs.
[263:51.79]Let me slow it down now.
[263:52.79]Here we go.
[263:53.27]I gotta go up there.
[263:56.83]We gotta beat the... Did I just aggro them?
[264:05.01]Alright, so up, around, back to where Gonzo is.
[264:10.10]Alright.
[264:17.66]I'm on the right path.
[264:24.51]Just gotta clean it out.
[264:25.15]I'm gonna take it slow, because I have full health.
[264:29.47]No reason for me to go crazy.
[264:30.59]Gonzo's gonna show up.
[264:31.63]Where are the other... people that are on top here?
[264:42.78]There's you.
[264:49.58]Come here.
[265:01.18]Make a jump quick!
[265:05.82]Yeah, I was supposed to put on the Japanese... I was gonna say Japanese dub for a second.
[265:10.19]I'm like, that's not how that fucking works.
[265:11.71]Gonzo!
[265:12.93]I forgot about Gonzo!
[265:15.11]Shit.
[265:16.54]Okay, that could have been real bad.
[265:30.85]Hold R1 to thrust.
[265:32.03]What?
[265:32.23]No, no, no, don't fuck this up.
[265:36.38]This is where I got collapsed on before.
[265:43.70]So I went down from here.
[265:44.60]I gotta go up from here.
[265:45.56]And watch out for the huge... Watch it.
[265:49.73]I need to pull somebody.
[265:54.79]Here.
[265:55.15]Just like... Well, that didn't do it.
[265:58.35]This guy.
[265:59.93]I...
[266:05.20]I have so many.
[266:05.90]Just follow me over here.
[266:08.68]Come on.
[266:09.76]One by one.
[266:10.16]Just pull them.
[266:11.87]Look at me.
[266:12.11]I'm here.
[266:23.54]I'm just barely not close enough to irritate you enough to...
[266:33.88]Okay.
[266:34.16]Bring it in.
[266:48.27]Come on, let me get rid of you before this guy comes over here, please.
[266:50.67]Oi!
[266:54.26]Alright, we're fine.
[266:54.86]Just pull him back.
[266:55.34]I don't want to...
[267:02.64]You got any more cards in your deck, asshole?
[267:04.58]Come on.
[267:14.77]Alright, that's two.
[267:15.49]There's only two more.
[267:22.67]Up top, and then... Let's just go.
[267:24.30]I'll aggro this guy.
[267:26.38]Maybe not.
[267:26.70]I can get behind him.
[267:28.64]Oh, this guy is stupid.
[267:36.62]Oops.
[267:39.37]No, I'm a stupid idiot.
[267:53.93]I didn't mean to do that.
[268:00.73]Alright.
[268:01.73]This is as far as I got last time coming up here, but there's an item this way.
[268:06.31]Let's get it.
[268:11.70]Can I trade these in?
[268:14.90]Can I seriously just sell these?
[268:18.10]Wait a minute.
[268:22.39]Will he see me do this?
[268:35.38]That was another Gonzo, but I don't think he didn't get me.
[268:40.34]Where was he?
[268:41.34]That guy just flew away.
[268:57.94]Why?
[269:00.04]Why did that happen?
[269:02.86]Was he the one making the sound?
[269:04.60]I don't understand.
[269:06.22]Okay, well.
[269:06.88]There's a chest here.
[269:20.94]Yes!
[269:22.18]Oh my goodness, thank god.
[269:23.26]There's a gourd seed here, I can buy a gourd seed.
[269:26.17]How much money do I have?
[269:29.03]550, do I have any more?
[269:31.17]Two heavy coin purses.
[269:34.01]That'll be 1500.
[269:34.39]It's not quite enough.
[269:44.51]But I'm gonna go... Because if I bring this... At least I'll get one gourd seed here.
[270:02.57]I'm glad you've come.
[270:09.43]Alright, there you go.
[270:10.47]That makes me five, right?
[270:14.01]I don't have enough money, so I'm just gonna store it.
[270:15.63]Let's just buy one.
[270:20.35]So, I'm gonna buy a heavy coin purse.
[270:22.75]Because I'm just gonna lose- I'm gonna die like 30 times here, probably.
[270:25.30]This is probably a boss.
[270:29.60]That'll put me at- yeah.
[270:30.88]Because that'll be 1500.
[270:39.64]I could also just grind for money, but I don't know if I really want to do that.
[270:49.26]Upper tower, antechamber.
[270:55.66]Hey, spoilers.
[270:56.25]This game has bosses.
[271:01.75]Oh, change the language.
[271:02.81]Right, right, right.
[271:03.49]I'm sorry.
[271:03.89]I keep forgetting to do that.
[271:11.12]Can you from here?
[271:11.82]I don't think you can change it from here.
[271:19.52]Oh, sorry guys.
[271:25.62]I did attempt.
[271:26.34]I made an attempt.
[271:38.35]Don't I know this guy?
[271:43.43]I swear to god, I know this guy.
[271:46.17]Oh, that's a thrust, okay.
[271:50.51]He's got a lot of fake outs.
[271:55.92]Oh, that gets a full second after that almost.
[272:15.20]This is the casting call for if you can fight this boss or not, apparently.
[272:18.78]Whoever's through this door.
[272:32.31]Alright.
[272:35.39]Nothing else in this house?
[272:39.17]Let's do that again.
[272:40.77]Discovery spawn.
[272:54.03]That's much easier.
[272:59.31]That's the real, that's canon right there.
[273:08.26]Oh, shit.
[273:09.52]Okay, there's a whole new area.
[273:15.12]Okay.
[273:17.14]Left, right.
[273:18.30]These are new enemies.
[273:20.94]There's a guy, like a window shop over there.
[273:23.02]Okay, let's try... Does this work?
[273:46.52]Yes.
[273:59.47]I'm surprised that actually did that.
[274:01.44]No, come on!
[274:02.28]What is this impasse here?
[274:03.30]Why don't you turn around?
[274:05.66]Which way are you gonna go?
[274:06.72]Go left.
[274:07.60]No!
[274:21.70]Shit.
[274:29.24]Back it up, back it up!
[274:30.38]I'm dead!
[274:35.59]Now you know that guy, don't you?
[274:41.85]There we go, it's always a thrust.
[274:48.17]There's a lady.
[274:50.80]Oh, please!
[274:52.44]No!
[274:53.29]Oh, I'm just a maid!
[274:55.17]For fuck's sake!
[275:00.13]Should I not have done that?
[275:17.30]Come on!
[275:17.72]Quickly!
[275:18.04]Get it!
[275:20.41]Is this guy not wearing pants?
[275:30.75]They both swing at the same time.
[275:31.91]I didn't block that one.
[275:41.28]Oh, I'm out of stamina or something.
[275:50.07]Alright, fighting you and your dad in the same room is not gonna work.
[276:10.17]Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna die again.
[276:11.73]Just get me the hell out of here.
[276:15.13]Where's my dad?
[276:15.93]How come I don't get a dad?
[276:43.58]Oh my god, I hate you.
[276:46.30]I hate you.
[276:46.72]Just give me all the stuff in case I die.
[277:01.63]That's pretty good, Scrap Iron.
[277:03.53]Ooh, sugar.
[277:21.73]Come on!
[277:23.05]Come on!
[277:24.05]Yes!
[277:27.07]I'll take a lock-on, please.
[277:30.11]No, DAD!
[277:31.10]Holy shit, he really is, like, pissed off about this.
[277:40.06]Oh my fucking god, he's gonna get a- he's gonna get vengeance for Dad, isn't he?
[277:42.96]I mean, not.
[277:51.49]Okay, that was way sloppier than it really needed to be.
[277:54.90]I have seven skill points.
[277:57.18]I think I should probably take care of this.
[277:58.46]I'm gonna go down.
[278:09.89]Oh man, okay.
[278:12.03]Uh, I gotta put some points in.
[278:19.26]I collected pretty much everything I needed to collect, right?
[278:30.15]This is important.
[278:30.73]So down here, I was doing this path.
[278:34.21]This one.
[278:34.63]Reduces the amount of damage to posture when attacked by an enemy with a sword.
[278:38.00]Cool.
[278:39.56]I really want this.
[278:44.62]Ashina Cross.
[278:46.98]Acquires the combat art Ashina Cross from a sheathed stance.
[278:52.25]Draw the blade at high speed.
[278:55.35]It costs spirit emblems to use.
[278:58.91]Hold the stance to intercept at will.
[279:04.97]Interesting.
[279:05.49]Okay.
[279:09.09]Wasn't there this?
[279:11.11]I'm going to wait for this one.
[279:12.49]I want the extra heal.
[279:15.25]Unless... This is not bad either.
[279:20.49]Excuse me.
[279:20.85]Just extra spirit emblems is just useful.
[279:25.23]I think I'll get it.
[279:31.53]What is this?
[279:33.35]Recovers vitality upon performing a successful death blow.
[279:37.36]That's also really good.
[279:42.24]Now get this one.
[279:45.64]Yeah.
[279:50.80]Doesn't go up by... Hold on a minute.
[279:52.36]Did that only go up by one emblem?
[279:59.16]That doesn't seem worth it.
[280:04.74]Um, okay.
[280:09.89]Interesting.
[280:11.99]Alright.
[280:13.87]Uh... Let's try to sneakily get through this area.
[280:17.32]Alright, up or down?
[280:23.50]Let's see.
[280:43.04]down, I guess, but does this not open?
[280:47.38]I feel like I should be able to open this.
[280:50.62]How did the guy with the no pants get in here?
[280:53.36]That's what I wonder.
[280:59.98]Alright, so now... I could fall down and try to kill one of them?
[281:10.91]Go for just a jump here?
[281:13.87]I think that's what I'm going to try.
[281:18.31]Imagine that happening in front of you.
[281:21.59]It just did.
[281:24.31]It did just happen.
[281:42.99]More eel liver.
[281:43.59]That's the electricity one.
[281:44.67]Alright.
[281:45.51]Room full of items.
[281:48.99]Posture damage.
[281:51.13]Alright, the next box.
[281:52.37]The next boss.
[281:54.67]We're already opening this one.
[281:57.24]I'm gonna try to eat those candies.
[281:59.06]Uh, is it a... An ancient Kodachi short sword.
[282:09.70]This is a new tool.
[282:11.30]Is it a second weapon?
[282:17.36]I don't think so.
[282:17.90]I think you only get the katana, right?
[282:29.94]This is the door I couldn't get in before.
[282:35.97]Cool.
[282:36.35]Okay.
[282:37.89]So then, if I wanted to... This is... Okay, there's this one there.
[282:45.50]Yeah, cool.
[282:46.66]Nice shortcut.
[282:48.34]That's a speed.
[282:51.94]Well, cool!
[282:55.57]Good thing I just lost half of my fucking money.
[283:04.60]Unbelievable.
[283:14.54]What's the point?
[283:15.44]Why do I even care about this shortcut?
[283:17.18]Why do I care about this?
[283:20.40]This just made this worse for me.
[283:21.90]This made it harder to get through.
[283:31.34]Right?
[283:31.91]Because this is just... Oh my god!
[283:35.29]I forgot about these guys respawning.
[283:39.07]I'm going back to town.
[283:40.17]I'm going back to town.
[283:46.92]I'm gonna buy the pouches.
[283:48.04]Because I have like 300, I need to just store it.
[284:03.45]I'll be so close.
[284:11.64]Can only afford two of these.
[284:12.62]This is just something stupid.
[284:18.91]How many vases do I have?
[284:19.99]Yeah, just sell, like, fucking two of these.
[284:22.07]That's all I need.
[284:30.49]Yeah, you're right.
[284:31.99]I haven't even opened the umbrella.
[284:33.15]That's true.
[284:41.43]So this puts us down here.
[284:45.29]Wait, no.
[284:51.55]Wait, which one was it?
[284:58.69]This one, right?
[285:01.93]I'll do prosthetic too.
[285:04.59]I'll do it in a minute.
[285:06.07]Shit.
[285:08.07]Damn it.
[285:08.79]There's a lot going on in my brain with this.
[285:14.17]I haven't even used the one I just got.
[285:23.43]I don't even know what it looks like.
[285:24.35]Alright, so it's the... Sabimaru.
[285:43.28]Let's take a look at it.
[285:54.11]The blue poisonous rust on the blade applies poison status.
[285:59.62]Prosthetic tool with the blade, allowing for a quick series of attacks together with the sword.
[286:09.74]I'll give it a try.
[286:11.03]And it does poison, that's cool.
[286:13.81]I already did the gourd seed, no.
[286:15.65]Okay, I have... I have... almost enough money to buy that seed.
[286:24.21]Let's keep progress moving here.
[286:35.56]Take your time, sweet boy.
[286:40.48]Show umbrella.
[286:44.98]Oh.
[286:47.38]It's just a- okay.
[286:48.76]Now what about this?
[286:54.45]That's not bad.
[287:02.89]It's really not.
[287:04.87]Probably supplement it for a little.
[287:06.39]Alright.
[287:12.55]Come on, you think you're gonna get it off?
[287:22.96]You're not gonna get it off.
[287:29.75]I'm at the bottom of this tower.
[287:35.28]Backstab the guy.
[287:36.16]Take out his buddies.
[287:38.46]And then... I'm not sure if there's anywhere I can go from here.
[288:01.63]Hello?
[288:08.17]The bonfire at the top as well.
[288:11.11]Yeah, that's true.
[288:11.71]I just want to see if there's anything else down here.
[288:13.99]Because it's easier to go from here than it is to go from the top.
[288:18.69]And there is a way over here.
[288:30.22]Another shortcut?
[288:35.80]Oh, this is the... I'm gonna go steal their fucking Lucky Charms and get out of here.
[288:40.60]This is the general here.
[288:41.47]Okay, hold on.
[288:49.76]I'm sure you are all aware already.
[288:52.67]This coming battle will determine the fate of all Ashina.
[288:56.81]We go now to risk our lives for Lord Ishii and the peoples of Ashina.
[289:04.11]We are Ashina!
[289:06.59]We are unbreakable!
[289:14.01]That's one way to stand up.
[289:15.79]Okay.
[289:15.97]I had to listen to the whole thing first.
[289:20.08]What's in here?
[289:23.98]Divine Grass.
[289:27.74]This is the full, complete, all heal that I'm not gonna use at all.
[289:33.95]I may have... You know what?
[289:34.83]I think I'm gonna sell that.
[289:38.79]Because realistically, think about it.
[289:40.11]In games like these, when they're so hard and you die all the time, you never know when to use them.
[289:45.15]I know a good opportunity.
[289:47.71]Sell it so you get money for it.
[289:49.91]Because if you use that and die at a boss, it's gone.
[289:53.49]You didn't kill the boss.
[289:57.74]I could use that money for other shit.
[290:08.45]This is probably a bad idea.
[290:21.41]Somebody behind me now?
[290:22.17]Who's behind me?
[290:23.60]Somebody's throwing rocks?
[290:24.60]Who's throwing rocks at me?
[290:32.42]That's a slash.
[290:33.12]Alright.
[290:34.60]Why is this idiot up here?
[290:41.39]Okay, I gotta memorize this shit.
[290:53.55]You fucking asshole.
[291:06.93]Shut up over here.
[291:07.71]God.
[291:33.76]Whatever.
[291:41.64]Does he have two?
[291:43.92]He's got them both back.
[291:45.74]I gotta fight him over here.
[291:46.78]Fuck.
[291:47.67]Whatever.
[291:48.79]Oh my god!
[291:51.35]I'm just boning back to the bonfire.
[291:53.67]For god's sake.
[292:05.18]There is a strategy that's possible, and that's just kill the guy next to him.
[292:08.79]No.
[292:09.89]Yeah, kill the guy next to him.
[292:12.49]Kill everybody.
[292:13.87]Then, once everyone's reset, go from there, right?
[292:26.10]So I can just keep picking them off one by one.
[292:33.63]And then he'll eventually reset with two, and I can just go behind him and kill him.
[292:39.19]I hope they don't come in here.
[292:58.58]They're not this stupid.
[292:59.50]They're too dumb to come in here, right?
[293:09.91]You ever played this game before, Jeremy?
[293:11.25]Come on.
[293:12.88]They did come in here.
[293:13.42]I knew it.
[293:17.92]Alright.
[293:33.77]So, let's see if that strategy works.
[293:56.43]Goodbye.
[293:57.43]Bye.
[293:57.77]Goodbye.
[294:01.71]Okay.
[294:06.05]You'll all forget I was here, and then you'll go back to doing whatever you were doing.
[294:11.53]Slap.
[294:11.79]People are linking the slap.
[294:13.21]That's great.
[294:18.30]We have a bunch of new people that came over from Dan's Gaming.
[294:20.62]Are you going to show them the slap as the first thing you show them?
[294:26.46]What about me beating Flame Lurker first try?
[294:28.58]Someone's got a clip of that one, right?
[294:29.76]I don't think they're gonna... I might just have to go kill them.
[294:42.71]They only have guns though.
[294:44.67]So, this one might not be as big of a deal.
[294:47.47]Yep, that's what we're doing.
[294:54.33]Get out again.
[294:58.60]Did I just... What am I locked onto still?
[295:12.60]He died to Pinwheel.
[295:13.72]Yeah, you can spelt that bullshit all you want.
[295:19.14]We all know the truth.
[295:26.78]C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
[295:58.63]Just go down and do it.
[296:00.63]What am I waiting for?
[296:03.30]Now I get the hell out of here.
[296:09.28]So hopefully this is easy.
[296:10.12]Let's see.
[296:10.48]Is he going to reset here?
[296:12.52]Don't come in this room.
[296:13.83]Oh, fuck.
[296:14.29]He came in this room.
[296:15.93]No, he's not.
[296:16.27]He doesn't know.
[296:25.19]What?
[296:25.65]Huh?
[296:26.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[296:28.43]Did he just fucking bait me to do this?
[296:32.90]Oh my god.
[296:35.60]Now where is he?
[296:41.44]Come on.
[296:43.24]Ugh.
[296:57.88]Is he going to come to square one?
[297:08.13]Come on, back out here so I can... Let me beat this guy first try.
[297:16.67]Come on, reset, reset, reset.
[297:17.85]I'll just hang off the ledge.
[297:19.07]I'm so hidden right now.
[297:22.07]I am twice overhidden.
[297:29.88]Drop down, yeah.
[297:39.47]Is he go- where is- is he still in there?
[297:42.87]Where is he?
[297:47.01]There he is.
[297:47.45]I don't know what the hell he's doing.
[297:51.41]I don't think he's gonna reset.
[298:02.38]I hate it.
[298:02.70]I love it.
[298:03.56]That's fast.
[298:43.82]He just sweeps and he just thrusts.
[298:47.67]Like that.
[299:00.57]Fuck that tracking though!
[299:14.33]Oh my god.
[299:34.62]Goodbye, I'm dead.
[299:54.01]Hey, thanks for the aid.
[299:59.51]When he's gonna hit you, move.
[300:02.95]Nah!
[300:04.22]Nah.
[300:09.12]I'm just gonna be a dumbass.
[300:09.94]Ready?
[300:10.16]Watch this.
[300:14.96]He's flocking the door.
[300:16.00]Never mind.
[300:26.89]Wanna see how you do this like an asshole?
[300:29.14]I'll show you.
[300:33.46]Nevermind.
[300:57.55]How many pizzas is it gonna take before you guys eat the whole pie?
[301:00.11]Come on.
[301:00.75]Here we go.
[301:02.13]Yep.
[301:02.83]Yep.
[301:06.39]Somebody else fighting down there?
[301:07.65]Okay.
[301:10.81]Okay, fine.
[301:16.74]Time to lose these ones now!
[301:25.93]So... What?
[301:28.51]Really?
[301:29.25]You're that far away and you still are doing this?
[301:33.85]What the fuck?
[301:36.81]Oh my... And now I'm back down here again.
[301:58.07]Can you leave me the fuck alone?
[302:03.76]Can you see him?
[302:04.50]Oh yeah, he's across the whole game.
[302:06.10]Oh don't worry, I have homing fucking boomerangs that I can throw.
[302:11.36]As long as I have line of sight from across the game, I'll hit him.
[302:17.87]This whole thing was just a mistake.
[302:26.14]I need to reset.
[302:27.20]Just reset the damn thing.
[302:28.97]My god.
[302:34.03]I went in there like an asshole and then had aim hacks pointed at my head.
[302:38.59]Fucking bald Gandalf over here.
[303:10.99]I'm at the stage again where, like, I just get shaken up.
[303:15.53]Somebody just bursted through the door, grabbed me by the back shoulder, and just rocked me back and forth as hard as they could.
[303:32.12]Come on, man!
[303:33.16]Let's go!
[303:34.22]He's got a backwards hat on.
[303:36.30]He's just, like, fucking funneling alcohol.
[303:37.90]Let's go, buddy!
[303:38.86]Come on!
[303:42.34]Then he leaves the room.
[303:43.66]I don't want to go down there.
[303:45.40]I don't want to fucking do that.
[303:47.70]What have I done?
[304:13.02]Alright, can I please stop being so stupid?
[304:18.10]Did I do that?
[304:18.80]I started coughing and I had to mute.
[304:21.20]How did I do that on purpose?
[304:22.36]I didn't... I'm just going to the front door.
[304:31.31]This is gonna be another one of those situations.
[304:32.55]It took me so long to kill... It took me so long to kill the last mini-boss.
[304:42.16]See, I'm looking up.
[304:43.04]I'm at the bottom of a giant skyscraper.
[304:47.96]And I just know it's gonna be a very long climb to get up there.
[304:53.45]And I got two plungers.
[304:56.51]They're guaranteed to work.
[304:57.79]They're not some weird, like, little fucking gremlin guy.
[305:00.61]Yeah, hey, I guarantee you these will work.
[305:05.72]100%.
[305:06.56]The plungers are perfectly fine.
[305:08.10]They work.
[305:11.77]But I have to climb up.
[305:13.77]Like that side of the Empire State Building plunges.
[305:17.21]And now, what if I'm already fucking it up?
[305:18.75]Isn't there one of those things up here?
[305:46.28]Why did it not grab the wall?
[305:50.65]Why?
[305:52.05]Can I not grab that?
[305:55.81]What?
[305:56.57]Why?
[305:57.11]I'm so flustered right now.
[306:01.39]I need to go eat like a Snickers.
[306:03.91]I'm gonna shove the Snickers up my fucking nose.
[306:17.24]Okay.
[306:19.04]What was my plan here, though?
[306:20.23]What's the plan?
[306:22.37]I don't have a plan.
[306:23.95]It was to kill guys?
[306:26.15]Don't even think about it.
[306:29.93]I don't have a plan.
[306:34.24]There's no plan.
[306:34.84]I have to come from this way.
[306:47.42]Where did they come from?
[306:48.64]I don't have a goddamn plan.
[306:51.68]I mean, the plan is to... You gotta backstab this big guy.
[307:00.64]And then just deal with all the other people.
[307:04.10]That's just how it works.
[307:05.19]I mean, that's how I'm gonna do it.
[307:06.49]I might be wrong.
[307:08.49]I'm definitely wrong.
[307:10.85]But every time I play the way I think is wrong, I end up winning.
[307:15.89]We all know it.
[307:17.19]Look at every boss fight, everything, every encounter.
[307:36.34]What do you got?
[307:44.00]Fight him in this stupid room.
[307:58.36]Slash?
[307:58.84]Dash?
[308:00.98]What?
[308:01.34]What would you do that for?
[308:03.67]He felt bad for me.
[308:04.57]He just gave me a free hit.
[308:06.89]Yeah, but you're doing really terribly.
[308:08.51]People are just making fun of you, so I'm gonna make it easy.
[308:10.33]I'm getting trolled right now by a guy in PvP.
[308:12.15]He knows he's gonna kick my ass.
[308:21.49]I think, actually, you know what's funny?
[308:22.53]I think this has actually happened before when I played in Dark Souls PvP.
[308:26.09]And then they one-hit kill me.
[308:26.95]What is this?
[308:38.06]What are you doing?
[308:38.66]Get in here.
[308:43.68]Are you not going to fight me inside?
[308:45.16]Why do you want to fight me over here?
[308:52.88]Fuck!
[308:53.26]Okay, at least he's in the room.
[308:59.34]That was the sweep.
[309:00.02]I thought it was the thrust.
[309:01.44]Fuck me.
[309:04.55]Look at his health, though.
[309:06.33]Like, come on.
[309:10.57]He's so close to this point.
[309:15.31]There's one.
[309:25.35]Oh, my frames are dying.
[309:27.17]Dropped frames everywhere.
[309:28.57]I think we're good.
[309:43.78]Dash?
[309:46.40]Holy fuck, how did he not hit me with that?
[309:47.62]I have no idea.
[309:51.24]I wish you would stay in this room!
[309:55.38]Oh, you such an asshole.
[310:24.85]oh why come on don't you think about this don't you think about this
[310:57.78]He doesn't like fireworks.
[311:00.06]Did you actually just do that?
[311:16.63]Hahahaha!
[311:42.02]Alright, cool.
[311:42.76]So, now what do I do?
[311:45.62]First try, more like... I want you to take a moment.
[311:49.92]Everybody.
[311:51.04]To understand.
[311:54.16]The first time, I did it the stupid fucking way that I wanted to do it, and it works.
[312:00.47]I have to just trust my instincts here.
[312:03.17]Dude, what if I, like, sneak up, you know, creep up behind him and get a backstab, and then go back around and bark, hey, bark, come on, get on the bus, bark.
[312:28.22]You don't know?
[312:28.58]That's Waldo from, uh, what's his name?
[312:30.60]Waldo from The Simpsons?
[312:32.18]I don't even know his name.
[312:33.72]The guy that drives the bus.
[312:35.10]Oh, fuck.
[312:35.70]They all have guns.
[312:37.18]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[312:52.75]Ow.
[312:53.89]Just...
[312:56.54]That's how this game works.
[312:57.44]I one-shot the drunk boss by killing his guys, running and rinse and repeat.
[313:01.88]Then I... I... I... Okay, can I please... No!
[313:07.69]Wait a... Now... Oh, excuse me!
[313:09.57]Did you forget about me?
[313:10.51]I don't want to throw utensils down!
[313:15.85]I don't... I think I can get out of here now.
[313:23.09]Hey, don't you forget about looking at me!
[313:29.46]I think that's it.
[313:30.38]There's nothing else I can do.
[313:31.18]I have to now go all the way up the tower, maybe?
[313:34.10]I don't know.
[313:45.29]Don't be a fool.
[314:08.48]What?
[314:08.82]Oh, right.
[314:15.38]Up the stairs?
[314:15.82]Ah, I don't think up the stairs.
[314:21.22]Maybe.
[314:23.00]Maybe.
[314:23.26]Um.
[314:27.73]I actually have no idea.
[314:30.93]What do we have?
[314:31.29]What do I have for places here?
[314:34.29]There's up here, where the, that first top of the tower is.
[314:40.42]There's... I could go back... I could go down to that sunken valley.
[314:45.15]Let me see.
[314:56.39]There's that way down towards the monkeys, but that goes down to the sunken village place.
[315:03.74]Let me go back up to the top of the building.
[315:13.39]Just go all the way up and see.
[315:22.92]The Japanese audio is in the options.
[315:24.72]I don't see it anywhere.
[315:45.80]Yeah, you have to do it at the menu.
[315:46.68]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[315:58.31]I'm so bad at stealth.
[316:03.95]So... What about back up front?
[316:08.31]Let me just see.
[316:10.51]Because I came in here...
[316:14.80]Is there more up?
[316:18.40]This is the explode guy.
[316:19.38]I thought he was already dead.
[316:42.63]I thought it was that guy right there that does the hoop.
[316:47.50]Um... I heard him, I just, for some reason, didn't think he... I thought he came from, like, down there.
[317:02.95]I didn't think he came from over here.
[317:04.63]So he was up there.
[317:05.29]Alright.
[317:08.31]Um, I don't think I can go higher from here.
[317:16.12]I'm just gonna rest again.
[317:31.31]He did it this time.
[317:32.67]Imagine being that strong that if you walk into a display, it just explodes in front of you.
[317:37.19]Imagine just the absolute balls you must have.
[317:43.09]And you just don't give a shit.
[317:44.17]It just explodes.
[317:47.63]Alright.
[317:51.01]Oh, that's that lady.
[317:54.11]So this door I can't open.
[317:56.18]I can go in that room.
[318:01.24]Yeah, I am sorry for all the coughing, guys.
[318:05.24]Oh, shit.
[318:06.42]Oh my god.
[318:06.76]Oh my god, what do I do?
[318:07.54]Oh my god, how do I stop this lady from doing anything?
[318:09.37]What do I do?
[318:14.77]I thought I had, like, a shuriken or something.
[318:16.39]I didn't.
[318:23.31]It's just one.
[318:23.77]Just one.
[318:24.19]One on one.
[318:24.69]One on one's fine.
[318:25.19]Poisoned him.
[318:53.94]Fuck, he broke my posture!
[318:55.14]I have a lot of trouble with these guys.
[319:01.06]I don't know why.
[319:04.24]They're just better than me in every way.
[319:09.35]Dude, you have no health.
[319:10.87]Will you just... Fuck off.
[319:14.31]That dude was already dead.
[319:15.29]That dude was dead three times.
[319:19.71]Oh, shit.
[319:25.93]That was just lag, man.
[319:26.95]I killed that guy, like, four times, and his computer and his internet connection caught up with him.
[319:38.76]Such bullshit.
[319:39.32]I hate when people, like, you know, rip out their ethernet code and plug it back in.
[319:43.92]Do you really want to win that bad?
[319:48.06]Oh, okay.
[319:48.38]Well, here's that room I couldn't go in.
[319:54.06]So we got an old lady with a cupcake and... ...this guy.
[320:02.82]Well, I can definitely get you.
[320:15.46]I didn't want her to start screaming and then all of a sudden we have a big problem.
[320:19.03]We have a big problem already.
[320:36.61]Bye.
[320:36.81]They're not going to follow me in here, right?
[320:42.92]They don't know where I am.
[320:46.36]It's just two people?
[320:47.14]It's three.
[320:52.90]It's the guy with no pants.
[320:54.42]Yeah, see?
[320:54.94]Two guys.
[320:55.80]It's actually four guys.
[320:57.78]Three guys.
[321:00.53]Just go after them.
[321:01.27]It's only two guys.
[321:02.15]It's three of them.
[321:12.46]There's no way I could have, like, pulled him.
[321:23.64]Oh my god.
[321:24.53]How many times do you have to block an attack before you fucking do something?
[321:52.60]Oh, just open this.
[321:57.34]Now I can just sneak in here.
[321:58.46]Why would I want to do that, though?
[322:02.37]Wait, what?
[322:04.59]Is there an item over here?
[322:05.37]These gross, gross mouth streamers, is what somebody just called me.
[322:24.35]Gross mouth.
[322:26.21]Hey, I'm sick.
[322:28.67]I get an excuse.
[322:35.68]You're killing my posture, man.
[322:44.90]Just destroy it.
[322:50.22]Back to back in a row.
[322:52.60]I hate you.
[323:17.35]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[323:21.25]Oh, did it work?
[323:25.41]Did I get it?
[323:27.14]I don't know if I did.
[323:40.59]You've got to be kidding me.
[323:45.11]No, don't do the magic.
[324:22.96]I'm going to be so angry at you if you beat me here.
[324:28.70]Okay, this guy kills me.
[324:31.17]I'm going to gift 600,000 community subs.
[324:40.99]I'll give a sub to everybody on Twitch.
[324:42.57]Everybody that has a Twitch account.
[324:45.11]I will contact Twitch directly to do this.
[324:52.75]Alright, don't have to do that.
[324:59.92]So, what is here?
[325:08.37]Well, I have a second here.
[325:09.39]How much money do I have?
[325:10.89]Alright, it's time.
[325:15.07]I need another gore.
[325:21.50]Double or nothing?
[325:22.24]No, I ain't doing that again.
[325:23.08]So now I have the pouches.
[325:30.75]So I got six, seven, eight, nine.
[325:33.49]Well, yeah, okay, I got plenty.
[325:37.13]So let me just do the math right here.
[325:38.73]So I have six, 73.
[325:39.52]Seven, eight, nine, 10.
[325:41.22]So four, so 11, uh...
[325:49.30]That'll bring me to... I need 2,000, right?
[326:01.41]And then I can sell some little piece of shit.
[326:06.81]Hey!
[326:07.21]I'm telling you, it's probably worth it.
[326:11.75]Alright, so I can just get rid of the vases.
[326:14.21]I don't use them.
[326:15.38]I hate these things.
[326:18.35]So I need... 73... 83... 93... Nope, not enough math.
[326:26.49]Wrong.
[326:27.61]What a dummy.
[326:29.27]What an idiot.
[326:33.36]Gord C. So this will bring me to 6, right?
[326:39.02]Yes!
[326:49.38]Maximum Gord's increased.
[326:52.00]While I'm still here, let's take a look at what I can do with the upgrade path here.
[326:58.30]Any new tools?
[326:59.34]No.
[327:01.80]Okay.
[327:05.18]This is what I've already purchased.
[327:15.30]Don't know what this is, though.
[327:18.68]I have the improved firecracker, which takes me down to spring-load flame vent.
[327:26.45]This is currently unavailable because I don't have this.
[327:28.99]I'm missing some new tool that I should probably have by now.
[327:36.20]Play the game where you spill the buckets.
[327:37.74]He's talking about... He's talking about this for cleanup detail.
[327:45.17]Why I've missed a cleanup detail?
[327:46.39]Cam on.
[327:47.09]What the fuck?
[327:47.55]That'd be bad because I don't have any clothes on.
[327:57.82]Some of these people say they should buy the memo.
[328:00.34]How much is it?
[328:02.64]Sabimaru memo.
[328:03.58]$500!
[328:03.90]Until next time.
[328:24.75]I don't have it.
[328:29.21]What's the memo?
[328:36.90]Does it unlock an ability for it or something?
[328:46.28]Am I sweaty?
[328:48.74]Yeah, probably.
[328:51.96]Upper tower.
[328:52.88]Here we go.
[328:59.05]I'm sick, don't want to be bothered with a facecam.
[329:00.83]Yeah.
[329:02.15]Yeah, I've been kind of under the web.
[329:13.99]So.
[329:16.84]There's a thing I can listen to right here, and I can go down, but hold on.
[329:21.10]Where does this bring me?
[329:24.20]That brings me here.
[329:24.92]Yay!
[329:28.15]Alright, let's listen to the memo.
[329:32.72]Lady Emma, tell me, what has caused the state of this man?
[329:38.32]Now, I know the door.
[329:40.36]That is what it is called.
[329:41.95]Are you telling me that this is Ashina's secret weapon?
[329:44.99]I just wanted to hear this.
[329:46.29]Those who drink it cannot fully die.
[329:49.86]No.
[329:50.84]They become unable to die at all.
[329:53.98]The rejuvenating water, it also... It springs from the dragon's blood, does it not?
[330:00.50]Yes, Lady Yama.
[330:03.02]I do not believe the dragon's blood is sacred.
[330:07.07]Not at all.
[330:09.29]Okay, Larry Lizard says, Streamer, please stop what you're doing.
[330:12.21]Can you play my favorite game?
[330:13.47]Yeah, what's up?
[330:13.87]Which one?
[330:14.17]I'll load it up right now.
[330:17.37]Which one?
[330:21.97]What's your character?
[330:23.19]Sekiro.
[330:24.19]Alright, let me load it up for a second, though.
[330:35.75]FromSoftware.
[330:37.87]That's Game of Thrones, but here we are.
[330:44.85]Is this it?
[330:58.01]Yeah, I aim to please.
[330:59.07]Yeah, I wasn't planning on playing Sekiro, but I guess I'll try it.
[331:04.93]Uh-oh.
[331:27.03]I'm gonna give you three seconds to come out with your hands up.
[331:31.63]One.
[331:33.31]Two.
[331:34.42]Three!
[331:41.36]Shoulda fuckin' listened.
[331:56.75]Should've listened.
[332:13.22]Oh, wow, that was overpowering.
[332:15.34]Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[332:33.29]That was, uh, I got him.
[332:37.81]Hanging scroll of an old battle.
[332:41.70]Ghosts once lurked the lands of Ashina.
[332:44.96]The ghosts.
[332:47.54]Lightning was of the Fountainhead Gods.
[332:49.76]Unstoppable by normal means.
[332:52.19]Avoid ground.
[332:53.63]Reverse the lightning.
[332:59.89]Lightning reversal.
[333:01.99]If one is standing on the ground, lightning surges through them, making movement impossible.
[333:08.37]But if one is struck while in the air, the lightning can be dispelled from the body and sent at an enemy instead.
[333:20.22]Don't stand on the ground.
[333:24.84]Get lightninged in the air.
[333:33.74]Okay.
[333:41.59]Can I go up here?
[333:43.51]No.
[333:48.27]Pellet.
[333:49.01]Well, we are getting items here.
[333:55.69]Gonna get introduced probably to a boss real soon, I think.
[334:06.58]I can see him.
[334:07.22]He's just waiting there.
[334:08.18]Look at him.
[334:14.60]He's gonna fly in, right?
[334:17.14]Who's whistling to me?
[334:24.90]Oh, no.
[334:25.52]Here it is.
[334:26.22]Okay, let's go.
[334:41.84]Lord Ishines.
[334:45.98]It's a wonder he is still with us.
[334:48.68]A miracle.
[334:51.95]Is that so?
[334:58.58]Rematch from the beginning.
[335:01.44]Divine Heir, I'll ask you once more.
[335:11.97]Accept me to your mortal oath.
[335:16.94]Intifada Refuse.
[335:20.64]The die.
[335:21.32]You cannot do that, Lord Genichiro.
[335:26.98]Your victory that day means nothing.
[335:30.94]He will risk his life to take me home.
[335:35.75]Is this the final boss?
[335:36.77]I don't think so.
[335:38.15]He is my shinobi.
[335:41.97]And he's also here.
[335:43.62]That's what I would say.
[335:45.10]He did the thing.
[335:45.70]He did the land.
[335:46.32]And he did the look up too.
[335:47.04]This...
[336:01.58]This will only take a moment.
[336:03.85]Now watch as I die 30 to 50 times.
[336:06.35]Your Highness, I hope you have about an hour and 45 minutes.
[336:12.11]That's how long it's going to take.
[336:13.97]Okay.
[336:30.72]Slash?
[336:31.44]That looks like a thrust.
[336:38.39]Don't let him break you.
[336:42.69]That's a... Let me get that poison.
[336:52.72]Come on.
[337:02.45]Ow.
[337:10.51]Ooh, that's also a thrust.
[337:12.71]He's got a lot of moves.
[337:35.37]He's got him to half.
[337:37.78]Back it up!
[337:44.56]Fuck!
[337:50.14]Come on, my cool shit didn't work on you?
[338:11.47]I got out of that one pretty unscathed.
[338:23.20]Whoa, that's a grab!
[338:24.46]That looked like a slash!
[338:25.44]To me, it looked like he was queuing up for a big swing!
[338:28.61]Fuck!
[338:30.25]I'm gonna save my pellets.
[338:31.07]It's not worth it.
[338:52.07]Alright, got him down to one.
[338:57.57]Maybe I should.
[338:59.81]Fuck it, let's do it.
[339:17.93]He's a lot more, that's not a, I don't think he even does a sweep.
[339:32.01]Uh-oh.
[339:43.43]Now every time, dude.
[339:58.69]That was close.
[340:40.54]Get first fucking tried.
[340:42.24]Let's go.
[340:43.94]Let's go.
[340:44.26]Now just cut his pinky toe off.
[340:50.93]And then say he can go.
[340:51.55]It did only take a moment, you're right.
[341:11.67]Oh.
[341:12.37]Fuck.
[341:22.05]No, no, I didn't.
[341:29.14]Lightning, jump and do lightning.
[341:30.88]Here comes the lightning.
[341:31.70]It was just too easy.
[341:32.56]They're not going to let me have that, are they?
[341:38.96]You're not gonna let me have that, are you?
[341:40.40]I'm still gonna do it.
[341:41.04]Let's go.
[341:46.02]Shit.
[342:00.74]No!
[342:07.68]Holy shit.
[342:11.42]Oh my god.
[342:13.08]Fuck, I have no healing.
[342:14.42]Oh, man.
[342:19.86]You gotta jump every time.
[342:21.24]Every time you see the lightning, you gotta jump.
[342:25.08]Damn it.
[342:27.00]All my confidence.
[342:27.92]There goes all my confidence.
[342:30.50]It built up, and I just shit it out all over the ground.
[342:40.56]I don't even remember where the hell that was.
[342:41.82]It was like an open window, right?
[342:51.77]Where the fuck was that?
[342:58.59]Oh, right there.
[342:59.15]Fuck.
[343:03.32]It's alright.
[343:03.92]I just gotta be... That wasn't that bad.
[343:05.66]First try.
[343:06.68]Alright.
[343:11.31]I did make it clean.
[343:12.16]That wasn't clean.
[343:19.70]That was very unclean.
[343:58.99]I'm gonna give this motherfucker a chance.
[344:00.17]Let's go.

[344:45.54]Seriously, lock that fucking guy up.
[344:49.14]Can you please give that guy like a $1500 speeding ticket?
[344:52.86]He's fucking obnoxious.
[344:55.52]Oh my god, I was doing so good too.
[345:01.69]And not over yet.
[345:10.68]Oh my god.

[349:31.90]Mom, I gotta revive, mom.
[349:34.52]Calm down.
[349:42.43]Oh, .
[350:03.97]I almost lost that.
[350:13.20]Genichiro battle memory.
[350:14.60]Nice.
[350:15.54]Nice.
[350:15.84]Ooh, what's this?
[350:22.34]YouTube is making race car noises.
[350:26.90]That was a cool fight.
[350:27.60]That was really fun.
[350:32.80]Turns the spraying blood of a victim to smoke.
[350:37.32]Activated after a backstab deathblow.
[350:40.84]The smoke screen allows for one to retake the element of surprise.
[350:45.47]Damn.
[350:48.41]Only be used after performing a backstab deathblow.
[350:51.71]They must be equipped in the equipment menu.
[350:55.63]Interesting.
[351:03.30]So, all the issues I was having with the group at the top of the stairs... Interesting.
[351:12.73]You can just go back into hiding.
[351:15.67]Yeah, there is XP and levels in the game.
[351:27.08]I don't have to do this again, do I?
[351:33.76]Do I have to fight him a third time?
[351:35.00]Phase 3?
[351:35.80]No.
[351:37.36]No.
[351:37.70]I even got the, like, unlock thing.
[351:40.71]Resurrection.
[352:15.41]So, you're final boss?
[352:17.75]You gonna turn into a demon or something?
[352:28.94]Okay, well... He's... self... I have seven points.
[352:38.48]What about my son?
[352:39.22]Where's my little, like, son?
[352:51.82]Hmm.
[352:55.52]Nope.
[352:55.92]This is it right here.
[352:56.52]Here we go.
[352:58.09]I wanted to buy this.
[353:01.05]So this makes the heal even better.
[353:02.79]What is the final move here?
[353:07.19]Living Force.
[353:13.11]Allows one to perform a follow-up attack with certain tools that imbues the sword with the tool's effect.
[353:19.95]Huh.
[353:22.69]After using certain prosthetic tools, right trigger is living force.
[353:26.26]The sword is imbued with the tool's effect.
[353:29.92]The only one that I have right now is flame vent, so I turn to a flame sword?
[353:38.27]Okay, cool.
[353:39.77]Still have two points.
[353:40.37]I don't know if I'm going to spend it on anything, though.
[353:47.27]I'll probably just get this.
[353:55.96]Either that or maybe this too.
[354:03.05]I'm not sure I want to go all the way down this tree.
[354:04.73]That doesn't seem that interesting to me.
[354:12.92]Or, no, this is cool too.
[354:14.44]No, I'm saving it.
[354:16.52]That's the moment you get health back.
[354:20.91]I'm actually going to pee again.
[354:22.67]So, I'm going to go use the bathroom.
[354:26.01]I'll see you guys in just a minute.
[354:29.72]We'll keep going.
[354:31.78]See you soon.
[357:16.11]Oops, sorry.
[357:18.85]We're back.
[357:23.55]Ooh!
[357:26.25]I can upgrade twice.
[357:27.27]This is more health and more posture, right?
[357:37.08]Very, very cool.
[357:40.46]I'm gonna move this out of the way, sorry.
[357:47.78]Alright, so rampaging beast and nothing more.
[357:51.62]Max health and posture.
[357:52.85]Then I can also do more attack power, right?
[357:58.13]From the Genichiro.
[358:02.41]Although distant recollection of such a memory provided sustenance to the wolf.
[358:06.25]Born a peasant, Genichiro Ashina was taken in by the Ashina after his mother's death.
[358:12.33]With his country on the brink of defeat, Genichiro took to heretical acts and mastered the lightning of Tomoe.
[358:20.83]Such heresy may be the key to saving her.
[358:25.98]Damn.
[358:29.55]Alright, awesome.
[358:31.37]Did the skills.
[358:34.15]Rested up a little.
[358:35.03]I guess we can talk to the lady?
[358:41.72]Seems the next course of progression here.
[358:44.04]Let's see.
[358:44.38]Epic prank?
[359:02.80]The hell are you guys doing?
[359:04.82]The hell are you guys doing?
[359:06.46]Lord Kuro is downstairs waiting for you.
[359:32.48]Okay.
[359:41.87]Is it another one already?
[359:44.51]Was this one here?
[359:45.09]There's one upstairs and one downstairs.
[359:46.55]Alright.
[359:48.29]I guess.
[359:50.83]What can I do for you?
[359:53.84]Want some?
[360:10.12]yes my lord I wished to save you I'm sure that I would do the same thing given another chance however undying begets stagnation the immortal oath the rejuvenating waters the dragon rot they all corrupt men to the point that they no longer live as men I wish to sever the chains of stagnation bred by the dragon's heritage wolf will you help me achieve this aim
[360:40.44]This sounds like the text-to-speech voice.
[360:53.71]I was trying to figure out in my head what that was.
[360:58.31]It is.
[361:04.34]How are these not the same thing?
[361:06.78]Help Kuro.
[361:07.84]Obey the Iron Code.
[361:09.24]Help Kuro.
[361:11.68]This is telltale level of choice here.
[361:20.29]Yeah, this is yes or hell yes.
[361:34.32]He wants to die.
[361:37.22]But what about my code?
[361:46.52]Yes or yes in a bad way.
[361:48.80]I think I have to obey the code.
[361:57.89]If I was in this position, I would say, dude, you know how many bosses I've had to fight and kill to protect you, to come find you?
[362:10.01]And for me just to kill you?
[362:11.23]You're not even a boss.
[362:15.71]Uh-uh.
[362:19.25]Obey the Iron Code.
[362:20.93]You severely underestimate how bad I am at the game.
[362:37.96]How many times have you died?
[362:39.82]Two?
[362:40.68]Three?
[362:42.94]Uh, yeah.
[362:44.20]Yeah, only three times.
[362:45.26]Yep.
[362:46.66]Yep, that's me.
[362:47.18]I'm really good.
[362:50.64]What does he know?
[363:06.06]If we are seeking to sever the immortal ties, I know a good place to start.
[363:10.62]Where?
[363:11.02]Tell me the next place to go.
[363:12.90]The Sunken Temple.
[363:14.56]Book from Kuro on the art of severing ties with the dragon's heritage.
[363:18.66]It looks old.
[363:19.94]The binding is torn and several pages are missing.
[363:22.76]Herein describes the means to perform the rite of immortal severance.
[363:26.72]Beyond the Fountainhead Palace, locate the sanctuary and imbibe the tears of the holy dragon of the divine realm.
[363:35.71]Okay.
[363:36.89]I can read.
[363:37.31]I can read.
[363:37.91]Just cuts him off.
[363:38.69]Puts his hand up close.
[363:39.91]Excuse me.
[364:06.66]OK.
[364:10.08]Now he's trying to slash.
[364:10.96]Is this cactus over here?
[364:13.85]Is there something special about it?
[364:15.91]Oh, no.
[364:16.27]It's a thimble.
[364:19.23]The text is...
[364:50.13]I might have to change the voice because of that.
[364:54.39]The text-to-speech fucking donation messages.
[365:02.92]Alright, well... Cool.
[365:08.96]Sounds good.
[365:10.46]Where do we go?
[365:11.22]Where to?
[365:12.04]Now, as to how I am certain, some of Lord Takeru's books remain in this castle.
[365:17.79]Books that he collected in order to find the divine realm.
[365:20.43]Find the books.
[365:21.31]I will search for them.
[365:22.75]In addition to finding a way to reach the divine realm, might we also look into how we might sever the immortal ties?
[365:30.80]A fine suggestion.
[365:32.58]Talk to Ishii.
[365:33.84]If anyone knows the answer, it is him.
[365:36.52]Wolf, come with me.
[365:45.07]I want to... What is the name of that thing?
[365:51.09]I want to clip... I want to put into the text-to-speech the last two or three sentences.
[366:00.82]And play the clips back.
[366:04.64]And just see if it's exact.
[366:08.08]I'm into this right now.
[366:08.80]Hold on.
[366:11.32]What is the name of that...
[366:16.66]Justin, text to speech.
[366:27.35]Is there a website where I can get that, or does it have to be through Streamlabs?
[366:33.75]How do you know that?
[366:43.10]I wonder.
[366:44.54]Let's see.
[366:48.32]This looks like the right place.
[366:49.94]Let's see if I can get.
[366:51.88]I think you guys might be crashing the server.
[367:10.22]Yeah, I can't.
[367:10.96]No, no, it's here.
[367:18.94]Hold on.
[367:20.50]I know it's in Streamlabs.
[367:22.34]Let me see if I can get it to test it.
[367:27.38]I'm pretty sure it is in Streamlabs, right?
[367:28.84]Let's see.
[367:29.38]This is going to take a minute, but it's worth it.
[367:35.14]OK.
[367:35.66]Let's go to my dashboard.
[367:38.21]And then let's go to, maybe I can just test the message.
[367:50.99]Okay.
[367:53.31]I wonder.
[367:56.51]Just donate to yourself with messages.
[367:58.91]I don't even have the link.
[368:03.17]Maybe I can do it with like bits.
[368:07.56]Alright, can I?
[368:19.86]Okay, here we go.
[368:27.84]I'm not sure I can get this to work.
[368:33.84]Oh, I don't think so.
[368:37.68]Unfortunately.
[368:38.32]Dude, how?
[368:45.33]Did they change where all this stuff is in Streamlabs?
[368:47.89]Where is all my shit?
[368:55.83]Spin wheel?
[368:56.93]Wheel spin?
[369:14.16]Oh, you got it?
[369:15.32]Is that it?
[369:15.66]Okay, here we go.
[369:21.54]Let's see.
[369:21.96]Is this it?
[369:33.41]I don't think it worked.
[369:49.17]No, it's not working.
[369:54.77]Can you guys hear that?
[369:55.47]Because when I pick a, like for instance, I just text and then play, it's not working.
[370:04.24]Let me try to link.
[370:07.75]Alright.
[370:15.53]Not working for me.
[370:16.27]Let it load.
[370:16.93]Yeah, it's loaded.
[370:21.35]Yeah, hit play.
[370:22.11]Hold on, let me see.
[370:31.62]Let me refresh this page.
[370:32.44]Maybe it's because I have this on.
[370:36.62]Yeah, okay, there it is.
[370:38.04]I think it's because I had a thing on Mozilla.
[370:55.03]What's the kid's name?
[371:02.79]Now it's not working.
[371:04.09]Alright, stop using the website!
[371:06.19]I think we're overloading the website with attempts.
[371:17.48]Justin doesn't work.
[371:19.38]No, nobody works.
[371:23.92]Hates me.
[371:27.22]Hates me.
[371:36.06]Hey, it's me.
[371:37.20]There it is.
[371:37.54]Okay.
[371:37.86]Alright.
[371:38.26]How loud is this?
[371:40.14]Hey, it's me.
[371:41.88]Let's get some dialog here.
[371:43.66]Let me make sure this works.
[371:50.90]Okay.
[371:52.60]Nobody use this website.
[371:53.38]You ready?
[371:58.67]I'm going to try to do this as best as I can.
[372:12.03]Oh fuck.
[372:13.18]Hold on, I need to turn, I need to put this like in a window.
[372:22.28]I'm gonna type everything he says on screen.
[372:35.41]You guys are not even gonna tell the difference.
[372:39.11]It's loud enough, right?
[372:47.49]test to see if it's loud enough okay let's go lord ishin is not within this castle citadel I'm told he is
[373:07.50]However, the path to his watchtower is closed.
[373:11.24]His health is a little... How do I get in?
[373:14.41]On the roof.
[373:15.45]There's a path patrolled by the Nightjar Ninja.
[373:18.21]It's intended for... Lord Isshin is not within this castle city.
[373:20.99]That won't be a problem.
[373:23.25]It's so fast.
[373:24.03]I've heard the Nightjar use smoke signals as landmarks.
[373:28.27]Yes.
[373:29.23]So if you follow their smoke signals, you should be able to reach Lord Isshin.
[373:34.09]And you can use this window to reach the roof.
[373:36.88]I can only do 5 seconds at a time.
[373:50.21]Find Lord Y'sheen and ask if he knows how we might sever the ties of immortality.
[373:56.34]He's recuperating in one of the watchtowers outside his castle.
[374:01.15]Reach the roof from that open window.
[374:03.53]Then follow the nightjar's footsteps.
[374:05.95]I entrust this task to you.
[374:07.83]I can't get him to do it.
[374:21.04]Come on, play.
[374:24.77]Stop loading that website.
[374:51.51]Dear Scarrow, head towards the Citadel and recover all the energy immediately.
[374:56.19]Wah, Mega Man.
[374:59.57]Okay, one more.
[375:02.59]Find Lord Isshin and ask if he knows how we might sever the ties of immortality.
[375:08.73]He's recuperating in one of the watchtowers outside this castle keep.
[375:13.54]Reach the roof from that open window, then follow the door to the castle.
[375:16.88]Find Lord Isshin and ask if he knows how we might sever the ties of immortality.
[375:21.74]Alright, I'm done.
[375:50.71]Come on!
[375:51.27]Okay, sure.
[376:26.88]Let me put this back in full screen.
[376:29.86]It's like just a typical donation.
[376:33.98]It's just a donation.
[376:41.28]Typical donation.
[376:43.74]Oh, that's so funny.
[376:52.29]Whoa, easy.
[376:55.29]Oh, we had our fun.
[376:59.64]Can you turn on donation text-to-speech just for this stream because of that voice?
[377:03.94]I don't even have that.
[377:04.88]I don't have a link.
[377:05.64]I don't have that set up.
[377:06.52]I don't have, like, a PayPal donation link.
[377:09.42]I don't have, like, text-to-speech for bits or anything.
[377:14.56]I don't have it.
[377:15.66]I don't even know how to set it up.
[377:16.73]That would take me, like, a while to figure that out.
[377:21.55]Alright.
[377:23.59]Well, that was fun.
[377:25.87]Let's go ahead and keep going.
[377:28.22]Wait, one last thing.
[377:29.70]I gotta move.
[377:32.94]It does take a bit to set up.
[377:34.12]Yeah.
[377:34.48]I finally.
[377:38.49]Only with that easy.
[377:39.17]Alright, here we go.
[377:42.57]Back to it.
[377:44.57]No, I don't do text-to-speech.
[377:47.53]I'm too easily distracted.
[377:49.00]I can never do it.
[377:53.86]And plus, I feel like when you have text-to-speech sometimes, if I'm... Let's say I was talking right now, and somebody did the get the key, you dumb fuck, they would be talking over me, and I'd be fighting with that voice.
[378:13.14]Okay, so I was supposed to follow him and then go... Let me just listen to this for real and actually comprehend it, because I was just...
[378:20.22]Find Lord Isshin.
[378:21.42]He's in one of the watchtowers outside this castle.
[378:25.32]Alright, follow the smoke signals, go out the roof.
[378:29.63]Did I already find that guy?
[378:52.32]I'm ready.
[378:54.86]Smoke signals.
[378:55.76]There they are.
[378:59.98]Jeremy, if you die, can I have your channel?
[379:04.01]No.
[379:05.53]It's going right to Burgah Boy.
[379:08.21]And he'll just get, like, TOS banned in, like, three days.
[379:10.63]And it won't even, like, matter.
[379:11.63]Alright, so we're going this way.
[379:23.25]Just want to make sure I walk around.
[379:25.34]They usually hide items back here in these random places.
[379:30.24]Hmm, okay.
[379:37.49]Stealth kill.
[379:54.96]Ow.
[379:56.21]Ow.
[379:57.01]Ow.
[380:00.55]Ow.
[380:00.69]Alright, every time I... Never mind.
[380:08.03]Somebody else is throwing shit at me.
[380:09.14]I gotta move.
[380:17.06]These people are making noises that I make.
[380:23.22]Follow the rooftops to find Ichi.
[380:30.59]Hey, streamer.
[380:44.86]You think that was actually a little kid that did those voices that recorded every one of those lines?
[380:48.96]Okay, great, fun, funny.
[380:52.08]Yeah, really funny.
[380:55.81]Like, 50 out of 50 humor there.
[380:59.83]Come on, man.
[381:07.90]Okay, if you don't have to fight, then just don't.
[381:11.52]Forehead.
[381:13.82]Just don't fight, Forehead.
[381:25.39]See you later.
[381:28.85]Didn't get the money though, unfortunately.
[381:32.82]Hey, it's me, Mr. Satan.
[381:33.98]Yup, that's me.
[381:36.10]Goku, what are you doing down here?
[381:37.70]Alright, okay, I'm gonna fall off the fucking building if I keep doing this.
[381:45.24]Might as well just keep it going for your own sake.
[381:52.64]It's the only way I can get strength.
[381:55.22]How do I get up there?
[381:56.40]I've already... I even told myself to stop doing it, and now I have to bone out of here.
[382:02.33]Wait, do I?
[382:07.67]Oh, what a dumb asshole I really am.
[382:22.05]Now we got Copypasta coming in, taking over my channel.
[382:34.26]Look at me!
[382:39.80]God, I wish when I said, don't do Copypasta, people would just listen to me.
[382:44.84]When people come in here and they spam Copypasta, it ruins my experience as a streamer.
[382:49.13]Because when I look over and I see spam...
[382:53.04]It distracts me and I need total chat concentration.
[383:02.43]Don't copy and paste this.
[383:11.11]Come on, I didn't get the indicator.
[383:21.82]Yeah, like, you know, hanging out in Jermis Street.
[383:23.60]You know, like, sometimes he just does, like, Mr. Satan and stuff.
[383:25.73]It's, like, so fun and funny.
[383:26.99]He's, like, just so lighthearted about everything.
[383:29.49]Last night, he did Mr. Satan, and he fell off the roof.
[383:34.56]And, oh, boy, the popcorn dropped out of the lap on that one.
[384:03.15]Can you do Vegeta?
[384:04.05]No.
[384:07.56]Nobody can do Vegeta.
[384:09.20]Nobody could, nobody.
[384:11.36]Nobody, nobody, nobody can do, nobody can do Vegeta.
[384:15.63]Not even me, Mr. Satan can't even do it.
[384:17.99]And I'll try, I'll try a lot.
[384:31.21]I forgot that we got raided by Dan.
[384:36.31]Sometimes I forget that there's, like, people here.
[384:38.73]Sorry.
[384:46.45]They all left?
[384:47.13]No, they didn't.
[384:48.03]They're all still here.
[384:48.77]Look.
[384:51.87]But seriously, though.
[384:52.51]Like, seriously.
[384:53.55]Thanks for sticking around if you have.
[384:57.50]I think I have to go that way.
[385:00.51]I gotta follow the smoke signals.
[385:02.69]There they are.
[385:03.11]And then... Why does this have two?
[385:13.66]You botched that blueprint.
[385:16.18]Did you just buy an extra one accidentally and you were like, eh, whatever.
[385:23.93]Well, I think I made it.
[385:25.93]Did I make it?
[385:27.55]Where am I supposed to go?
[385:34.85]I don't... What is it?
[385:40.45]He's in one of these towers.
[385:43.89]Whoops.
[385:45.01]I tripped.
[385:46.47]He's inside of one.
[385:48.19]Is it the one with two?
[385:49.10]Is that him?
[385:56.36]I think I found him.
[386:12.42]He said, follow the towers, follow the smoke signals, and he's in one of these.
[386:18.94]Do I just have to check the buildings?
[386:21.32]I think I might just have to check them.
[386:30.16]This one?
[386:32.62]No.
[386:36.98]Check.
[386:41.26]There's another one here.
[386:44.46]follow the smoke signals till you find him he's inside of one of the buildings make sure you don't fall off cliff not even close
[387:26.02]Oh no, Gonto!
[387:36.96]Where is this guy hiding?
[387:38.10]He said he was dying inside of a building somewhere.
[387:48.30]Smoke signals, dying in a building, upstairs, was it the guy?
[387:53.24]Wasn't there somebody?
[387:54.10]I swear there was somebody.
[388:01.82]Oh my god.
[388:29.98]Okay, where?
[388:31.22]Where are you?
[388:43.81]That's where the last one is.
[388:48.45]In this one?
[388:49.14]Alright, can I get inside of this tower?
[388:52.56]I don't know.
[389:00.90]This looks pretty big.
[389:12.16]My tongue is out right now.
[389:13.12]It's just sticking out.
[389:47.95]There's only three smoke signals.
[390:19.02]Noise joke.
[390:20.92]That's my favorite comment.
[390:40.53]Am I going crazy or... What the hell am I doing here?
[391:07.93]Go back to the kid.
[391:19.71]Dude, I'm trying!
[391:20.71]Dude, I don't know where to go!
[391:21.87]He said follow the smoke signals and he's been in a tower and I'm just trying.
[391:29.88]I don't know.
[391:30.34]I don't have a Wikipedia page open to tell me.
[391:34.90]Say it again, kid.
[391:38.57]Find him.
[391:39.34]Okay.
[391:40.60]He's in one of the watchtowers outside this castle.
[391:43.56]Reach the roof from that open window then follow the smoke signals.
[391:47.67]That's what I did.
[391:48.73]Kid.
[392:05.31]Look.
[392:06.39]Right there?
[392:07.69]There's a smoke signal.
[392:08.75]There's a smoke signal.
[392:11.15]Here we go.
[392:11.61]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[392:20.33]Really?
[392:23.29]What?
[392:23.59]How did I fuck that up?
[392:24.98]Where was the... That wasn't there before.
[392:28.80]How did I screw this up?
[392:30.36]Because there were other smoke signals all over the place.
[392:35.87]No!
[392:36.43]God damn it!
[392:39.43]Who cares what I... Who cares how I got here?
[392:42.58]Like, who gives a shit?
[392:54.99]I got there.
[392:55.53]I don't know how I got...
[393:07.33]Why would you put a smoke signal outside the front of your house?
[393:12.03]I can't... And by the way, that's not even on the roof.
[393:17.37]That smoke signal is clearly on his balcony.
[393:22.39]This guy's a grade-A dickhead.
[393:25.30]Tell him it's on the roof.
[393:26.40]Get to the roof.
[393:27.48]Oh, if I could slash him, I would.
[393:30.90]About the Divine Heir's life...
[393:33.13]Yes?
[393:34.05]There is something I wish to ask.
[393:36.74]Before that, Sakhi... What?
[393:39.28]You earned it.
[393:40.83]Take it.
[393:46.27]Are we gonna go back and give this to the guy?
[393:47.56]Taki is pretty good.
[393:48.00]We had him?
[394:12.68]The bonds that tie us are so deeply amusing.
[394:16.35]Don't you think, Sekiro?
[394:19.39]Wait, it's the guy with the mask.
[394:27.53]The divine heir's desire is to sever the ties of immortality.
[394:31.44]This is the guy that had me kill the rats.
[394:32.68]The mortal blade.
[394:35.30]If you had such a weapon...
[394:37.89]It may be the key to what you are after.
[394:40.34]The mortal blade.
[394:41.90]With it, you could kill one who cannot die through normal means.
[394:46.06]Yeah, if I gave that back to him, that would be really disrespectful.
[394:48.98]The infested, I believe they're called.
[394:51.90]I have not seen one before, but it said you could stab them through the heart or remove their head and they wouldn't die.
[395:01.93]If the stories are true, they'd surely be quite fearsome.
[395:08.19]To kill a monster such as that, you'd need the Mortal Blade.
[395:16.63]Where can I get that?
[395:18.29]Where is this Mortal Blade?
[395:20.23]Right here.
[395:20.55]I've heard it's held in Senpou Temple.
[395:23.23]However, they say the Mortal Blade can't be drawn.
[395:25.84]It's right behind me.
[395:26.30]Take it.
[395:27.02]What do you mean?
[395:28.42]I am not certain of the meaning.
[395:30.84]It's just here, sir.
[395:33.28]The gates to that temple are closed now, though.
[395:36.24]Who knows what those degenerates are doing shut away up there in the mountains.
[395:40.72]There aren't any decent roads leading there.
[395:43.39]How do I get there?
[395:44.59]The abandoned dungeon just outside of Ashina Castle.
[395:47.69]If you can pass through its waterways, you should find your way.
[395:55.91]Alright.
[395:56.71]You're leaving, Sekiro.
[395:58.37]Severing immortality.
[396:00.84]Sekiro or Sekiro?
[396:01.84]It's Sekiro.
[396:02.72]Sekiro.
[396:02.88]Sekiro.
[396:03.26]Sekiro.
[396:30.77]What?
[396:30.99]Hello?
[396:33.51]What's going on?
[396:38.11]Are they supposed to be in here?
[397:02.05]Uh, maybe... I don't think I want to fight him up with Grandpa.
[397:09.66]There's three of them in here!
[397:12.04]Something's not right... here.
[397:40.81]God damn it.
[397:41.59]Sekiro, hesitate for a second and you'll die.
[397:46.57]I have a training mission for you downstairs.
[397:49.69]Go fight fucking Snap, Crackle, Pop.
[397:54.15]Prove to me that you can take my Buddha idol thing on the ground over here.
[398:08.77]Who the fuck is not supposed to be in here?
[398:13.63]I'm fucking losing my mind Excellent, excellent
[398:37.26]It truly is the worst cereal, isn't it, Sekiro?
[398:41.96]Yeah, it is.
[398:44.20]Absolutely no redeeming qualities at all.
[398:47.76]Gets soggy in ten seconds, Sekiro.
[398:54.23]And tastes like cardboard pieces that went through a wood chipper.
[399:00.41]Yeah.
[399:07.15]So I'm just going here.
[399:26.22]Whoops.
[399:37.01]Alright.
[399:44.53]Running out of energy!
[399:46.87]Dude.
[399:52.19]Dude.
[400:09.07]Just, will you cease?
[400:10.79]Oh, nice hat.
[400:43.48]I have a note here.
[400:44.68]I wonder what it says.
[401:04.28]I don't even have the website anymore.
[401:12.31]I don't know.
[401:12.73]It's not even ahead of this shit.
[401:13.95]Hold on.
[401:37.37]Okay.
[401:38.33]So this is if Twitch chat gave this message.
[401:53.79]Let's see what it says.
[402:02.41]Wolf found something.
[402:04.39]I've opened a library.
[402:06.04]Meet me there.
[402:06.68]Thanks.
[402:07.40]Thanks.
[402:08.32]Appreciate it.
[402:31.89]Thanks for the, uh, thanks for the five dollars.
[402:40.30]Alright, let's, uh... What?
[402:53.37]Where are you?
[402:54.01]Are you here?
[403:01.57]so you've yes for defeating genichiro to think that lord genichiro would go as far as to drink the rejuvenating rejuvenating sediment that's what we call a particularly concentrated part
[403:17.09]of the rejuvenating waters.
[403:18.73]Oh, thanks.
[403:19.27]I'm sure you saw it for yourself.
[403:21.67]The rejuvenating sediment grants great resilience in one's flesh.
[403:27.07]One becomes able to withstand blows that would be fatal to anyone else.
[403:32.49]Nice.
[403:32.71]My mentor, Dogen, devoted much research to its uses, but all of his works, documents, medicines, everything, were burned and destroyed.
[403:47.43]But I heard one of the senior apprentices was able to salvage some of it.
[403:52.82]Probably Dojun.
[403:56.56]Did you ask Lord Kuro's thoughts on the matter?
[404:00.46]I did.
[404:01.36]And?
[404:02.08]We've decided to sever the ties of immortality.
[404:05.24]I see.
[404:06.15]I thank you for all of the help you've given me.
[404:09.33]Well, almost sounds like you're bidding me farewell.
[404:13.61]Ashen One.
[404:14.67]I've carried out my lord's orders.
[404:17.29]So I will stay here in the castle.
[404:19.52]Come and speak to me whenever you please.
[404:22.18]I will provide my assistance to you as a doctor.
[404:27.20]Oh, OK.
[404:29.84]This power, it's said to be a power of those who have been given the power of resurrection.
[404:35.29]So we have a new fire keeper is what I would classify it as.
[404:42.25]I don't think the power of resurrection comes without a cost.
[404:49.01]Goodbye.
[404:52.15]Goodbye.
[404:57.63]Gunfort Shrine Key.
[405:02.59]The gate behind the shrine's idol is made to be opened.
[405:06.75]The Sunken Valley Clan will shoot any stranger who approaches and the Snake Eye's guns are particularly feared.
[405:13.51]This elite group of women are descendants of the ancient Okami clan.
[405:17.20]Their especially sharp eyes allow them to snipe victims at great range.
[405:21.50]Got the key.
[405:28.08]Oh, this dust is awful.
[405:30.20]I have returned.
[405:31.54]Oh, Wolf, you're back.
[405:33.53]Did you meet with Lord Isshin?
[405:35.41]I did.
[405:35.95]He said the mortal blade, it could be the key to severing immortality.
[405:40.51]Well, the key's over there.
[405:41.31]The mortal blade.
[405:42.63]It's a sword.
[405:43.43]Why, smart clicks on?
[405:44.75]It shouldn't be.
[405:46.55]It can be found at Senpou Temple.
[405:48.63]I see.
[405:50.40]Yes, that seems promising.
[405:52.78]As you say.
[405:53.86]For my part, I hunted for any books that may contain clues about the aroma of the Fountainhead.
[406:00.03]It seems Lord Takeru indeed sought a way to reach the Divine Realm.
[406:05.45]So far, I've found one piece of relevant information.
[406:08.87]What is it?
[406:09.83]A flower.
[406:14.38]Show the droplet.
[406:15.52]Why are you streaming?
[406:16.42]I don't... That's kind of a loaded question.
[406:18.52]It's got a lot of answers to it.
[406:41.85]Give the droplet or keep the droplet.
[406:44.35]What are you going to do with it?
[406:45.07]I only have one more.
[406:46.63]I only have one of these.
[406:47.51]I already used one.
[406:58.58]I wonder what this does if you give it to him.
[407:07.52]If you should be so kind.
[407:09.34]Of course.
[407:10.31]Close your eyes.
[407:11.51]My lord.
[407:12.01]What?
[407:13.67]Lord Takeru's dragon blood lives on with you.
[407:18.55]Wait, he's... Wait.
[407:21.79]I humbly accept.
[407:25.30]Yes.
[407:31.08]What?
[407:32.86]You may open your eyes now.
[407:43.34]That was a boon granted by Lord Takeru.
[407:46.21]You can turn your monitor back on.
[407:50.07]Better resurrective power.
[407:56.79]It is said that relatives of Tomo once gathered the Fountainhead Fragrance and arrived at the palace.
[408:02.05]You may find a key where the waters of rejuvenation converge in a deep pool.
[408:07.10]And why a deeply fragrant flower?
[408:09.92]Lord Takeru left it behind.
[408:12.18]I was looking for information on the Fountainhead Aroma, and how it relates to the Divine Realm.
[408:18.18]There is water that flows from the Fountainhead through Ashina, and the book speaks of a white lotus flower that grows where the water pools deeply.
[408:28.49]That's the most expensive magic card.
[408:30.07]It's worth like $75,000.
[408:30.65]White lotus card.
[408:44.57]Do you prefer water with or without pulp?
[409:08.34]Uh, I really hate to tell you this, but if you're drinking water with pulp, that's like lead.
[409:14.94]You're drinking fucking all kinds of messed up, like, copper and minerals and shit.
[409:18.33]I don't know if you should drink, like, metal.
[409:22.81]I'm gonna say without.
[409:25.37]Crunchy water.
[409:26.05]Are you gonna turn on the Japanese voices or are you gonna make us suffer this shit?
[409:55.65]It's fine.
[409:56.81]What's wrong with it?
[409:58.55]It's just like, it's voice acting.
[410:01.99]What's wrong with it?
[410:10.94]My goodness.
[410:15.12]So little do you know, kid, and everybody that I've talked to in the game,
[410:23.64]Over the last 15 to 20 minutes.
[410:27.02]I... I have another rez.
[410:37.09]Really?
[410:41.52]Holy shit.
[410:44.28]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[410:46.22]Shadows die three times now.
[410:51.55]What was I saying?
[410:52.76]Right.
[410:53.60]I already have the sunken temple ready to go.
[410:56.38]It's like I'm ready to do it right now.
[410:57.54]I don't have to traverse anything.
[410:59.72]I've already explored down there already.
[411:03.18]Take a look at that.
[411:04.76]Oh, what's that?
[411:06.70]Made it.
[411:19.05]How did he get down here so quickly?
[411:22.18]Alright, now... Pop.
[411:28.38]There was... I went this... Which way was the right way?
[411:30.40]This way takes me to... No, that's not the right way.
[411:36.94]It said something about snipers, so good thing I had that hat.
[411:40.93]To protect from snipers.
[411:46.69]Hey.
[411:50.37]Can I just keep this on forever?
[412:04.07]Hmm.
[412:05.61]Very interesting stuff.
[412:07.71]I could keep going.
[412:10.03]Or I could go this way.
[412:16.34]Looks like certain death.
[412:18.96]Is it, though?
[412:21.10]Yeah.
[412:21.48]What's this here for?
[412:22.40]No.
[412:22.92]Wait.
[412:24.31]Can I make that jump?
[412:33.86]The guy down here... They're the most elite snipers in the entire world!
[412:45.97]A sniper... Looks like a can of tuna on top of a broomstick.
[412:59.44]I think I'm gonna be fine.
[413:03.30]Well...
[413:06.58]I always get... The hardest items to get in this game that are in the weirdest place are always the vases.
[413:12.23]They're just the ceramic shards.
[413:28.12]Any more?
[413:28.48]I think I have to get down eventually.
[413:29.94]No?
[413:33.34]I'll go in this way.
[413:36.36]This is where I was.
[413:38.52]What?
[413:41.10]What?
[413:41.70]Oh, whoa.
[413:45.32]I was supposed to.
[414:02.38]Hey, I mean, I could probably use a slice of pizza right now.
[414:08.60]Alright, somebody name food.
[414:10.16]Name like a food and I'll eat it tonight.
[414:12.22]Not on stream, but you know, a little bit when I go eat.
[414:17.80]Burger, sushi, a burrito.
[414:21.28]Ass, cool.
[414:23.34]I'm talking about something I can consume and eat for sustenance.
[414:32.07]Panini?
[414:32.45]That actually sounds pretty good.
[414:34.62]That's a good call.
[414:42.18]A gyro?
[414:43.38]I love gyros.
[414:46.08]Gyro, gyro, gyro, however you pronounce it.
[414:50.78]I think it's gyro, right?
[415:00.04]I've heard people say gyro
[415:07.98]It's Sekiro.
[415:09.56]Sekiro.
[415:11.89]Sekiro.
[415:12.63]Sekiro.
[415:13.31]I just saw somebody walk over here.
[415:29.28]Just keep going.
[415:29.88]I think I can get a kill here.
[415:36.36]If I didn't teleport inside.
[415:38.37]Nice fucking slide.
[415:44.61]That dude's playing Apex.
[415:55.92]The cough's so bad.
[416:15.69]Oh, my eyes are watering.
[416:16.59]That was the worst one all night.
[416:20.01]I'm so glad nobody heard that.
[416:22.69]That was purely just disgusting.
[416:26.22]It was absolutely fucking horrible.
[416:41.81]Oh, what a nice reload.
[416:43.25]Go on when he's reloading.
[417:05.61]Dr. Okra's Pizza?
[417:06.57]I had one of those on stream.
[417:08.97]It's the only time I've really ever eaten on stream was for that.
[417:11.21]Alright, let's take a look.
[417:15.77]Looking for stuff.
[417:18.85]Materials.
[417:20.73]Or... Trinkets.
[417:24.41]Or... Oh, it's that guy.
[417:29.95]Would you have a cook on stream?
[417:31.21]No.
[417:34.09]No.
[417:36.73]Not really.
[417:37.15]Probably not.
[417:42.55]Maybe it's a joke or something.
[417:44.43]The gunfort.
[417:49.83]It was even more formidable than we'd heard.
[417:53.62]We were reckless to go in unprepared.
[417:59.24]It takes me back.
[418:01.48]I can hear the sent boat temple bell.
[418:05.36]Would you... Would I cook meth on screen?
[418:15.32]Last hit.
[418:15.96]I need the gold.
[418:17.64]Um... No.
[418:20.44]I don't... Why would I do that?
[418:27.19]Aha!
[418:28.13]Well, there's... Here's this.
[418:36.15]Just gonna do a dive.
[418:44.27]That's what I brought this for.
[418:45.74]Nice shot.
[418:50.76]See, you probably saw at least three or four streamers play this part.
[418:55.62]And they were probably getting just... What happened there?
[419:04.61]I don't... Why didn't... Why couldn't I jump to that?
[419:09.31]For real?
[419:10.35]You guys... I mean, it's not like I didn't try.
[419:11.74]Oh, no.
[419:16.04]And they're shooting sniper rifles at me?
[419:18.02]Is this person... a gun?
[419:20.34]What?
[419:40.29]God damn it!
[419:41.15]Give me a second!
[419:42.65]Fuck!
[419:46.09]I don't know what it does!
[420:07.37]I gotta deflect there.
[420:08.23]Wow.
[420:08.91]Okay.
[420:13.78]Where's my gun?
[420:15.76]Oh, you're alive!
[420:16.38]This guy's gonna die every time, isn't he?
[420:20.60]Alright.
[420:21.10]Well, at least it's right here.
[420:44.26]Oh my fucking god, why Jeremy?
[420:46.22]Just do it the right way first.
[420:47.54]I'm gonna get shot right now.
[421:04.91]See, I can just block it.
[421:18.05]Fucking hell.
[421:20.53]What is that classified as?
[421:31.56]A grab?
[421:31.98]I think that's a grab.
[421:34.80]This is just a wacky moveset.
[421:56.20]That's not what I wanted to do.
[422:03.98]I got my own fucking bombs.
[422:21.67]Back it up.
[422:22.35]Back it up.
[422:23.39]Oh, god damn.
[422:39.59]Ah, that posture damage is bad.
[422:41.47]Almost.
[423:15.94]I almost have one down
[423:37.84]Parrying is just... Everybody... It's so hard because everybody is so different.
[423:42.65]Everybody's movesets are so completely different.
[423:45.11]It's relearning the whole video.
[423:46.81]It's like really... What is that?
[423:49.77]Like spin 360 degrees around in a goddamn circle.
[423:54.55]Really?
[423:56.93]I'm going for it.
[423:57.49]Fuck it.
[424:45.57]I'm out of posture out of posture That oh fuck I can't oh my goodness that's not good No Oh
[425:20.82]I wasted one of my resurrects, too.
[425:22.36]Alright, come on.
[425:31.34]Let's just...
[425:57.19]Alright.
[425:58.25]Come on.
[426:01.02]If you back up like that, I'm just gonna go for it.
[426:40.57]Getting the distance on this person is difficult.
[426:49.43]Oh my god, again!
[426:51.20]Come on!
[426:52.28]Oh, I'm so actually frustrated.
[426:58.04]That's, come on.
[427:00.00]Dodging and she just still stays there and just tilts with you and magnetizes to your head.
[427:08.52]And now I lost all of the fucking progress.
[427:10.92]That didn't happen that time.
[427:34.87]Gonna wait till the last second to dodge through.
[427:36.77]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[428:34.69]Get away from me!
[428:35.65]You pushed me off this cliff.
[428:54.24]I swear to God, guys.
[429:15.51]Where am I jumping to?
[429:18.83]Come on.
[429:20.27]Fuck that grab.
[429:21.15]Fuck that, like, Dark Souls 2 magnetized to somebody.

[429:28.10]Nobody wanted that.
[429:29.70]Nobody wants that.

[430:53.72]I just lost control there for a second.
[431:26.32]Nobody wants that.
[431:27.06]Nobody likes that.
[431:33.15]One B. Oh!
[431:39.08]Put the hat back on.
[431:54.29]One down, only 300 more to go.
[431:57.69]Nobody wants that.
[431:58.39]Nobody likes that.
[431:59.07]Nobody wants that.
[432:13.87]But I want that.
[432:22.12]That's fine.
[432:22.66]I can make it.
[432:24.67]Fuck you, snipers!

[432:34.14]Nothing.
[432:40.86]Just checking.
[432:47.25]This rain is bad.
[432:52.70]If that is a piece of glass, if that's a glass vase, I'm going to throw my controller into the sixth dimension.
[433:24.80]Okay, it's not.
[433:29.80]How do I get the fuck out of here, though?
[433:32.24]How do I get out of this?

[446:42.25]I may have to take a day.
[446:44.77]Because if this is going to be a problem, I'm going to get like laryngitis.
[446:51.44]So we're going to pick up exactly where we left off here.
[446:56.50]Hold on.
[446:56.76]Let me try to like... No, that's probably going to make it worse.
[447:02.72]Right where we left off here is where we're going to start.
[447:05.24]Not tomorrow.
[447:05.66]I'm going to take tomorrow.
[447:07.25]Because it really is probably the better idea.
[447:10.97]This is a lot of fun.
[447:11.77]Thanks for joining.
[447:14.41]We got a huge raid today.
[447:15.95]Happy to have you.
[447:20.90]Why is Larry David here?

[447:43.89]Really, really cool.
[447:44.53]Really cool of you.
[447:45.03]Thank you.
[447:47.80]So, I am going to just take this out.
[447:52.18]We had a bunch of bits.
[447:55.86]But I'm not sure I can read them all.
[448:00.08]No, yeah, I can.
[448:00.94]Yeah, I can.
[448:02.02]There's not very many.
[448:04.72]Your Boston accent is stronger.
[448:07.66]Hey, look at that computer.
[448:11.57]Read them in the voice.
[448:14.37]This is gonna end up just getting better randomly, and, like, I'll be fine.
[448:18.83]But I feel like I'm using... Use the Justin TTS.
[448:24.81]No, no, no, no.
[448:25.73]We'll go through.
[448:28.17]Unfortunately, I can't read every single paragraph and message right now.
[448:32.76]But... Okay, here we go.
[448:36.12]That's actually a really good idea.
[448:38.18]Here we go.
[448:39.82]I'm gonna mute this.
[448:42.31]I'm going to come out of here.
[448:47.52]Let's have Justin read these bits.
[448:51.38]Turn it up a little.
[448:53.04]And move this.
[448:58.24]Turn Sekiro down.
[448:59.34]Alright, so I'm just going to copy and paste here.

[449:34.01]This next one is from Freudian Weapon.
[449:39.79]Thank you, Freudian, for the 10 bucks, Freudian.
[449:49.92]Oh.
[449:50.26]Well, sorry.
[449:50.76]Sorry about that.
[449:51.28]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[449:53.44]Thank you.
[449:53.68]You as well, Freudian.
[449:54.18]Really appreciate it.
[449:54.66]This next one's from Sad Vega for $2.50.
[450:14.80]Frankers250 this game is great.
[450:17.20]I have a cough IRL and I blamed you for my dragon rot.
[450:20.70]Fix it already you jerk.
[450:22.70]Seriously though my only complaint is the AI in this game resets way too easy from watching you kill its friends to being perfectly fine.
[450:34.28]Really the only gripes that I have about Sekiro are the fact that it's a stealth game, but then it's also like a Dark Souls game too, and it can be confusing sometimes.
[450:46.09]Because there's certain sections of the game that are stealth only, that essentially you can hide in bushes and stuff.
[450:54.14]But thank you for the $2.50.
[450:56.34]Just takes some getting used to, that's all.
[450:59.21]This next one is $15 from Ufawa.
[451:03.27]Thank you.
[451:05.05]Cheer 1500 chat has been painful these past two days.
[451:08.77]Thanks for always being a positive energy and you always brighten my day.
[451:12.88]Hope you feel better less than three.
[451:14.88]Thank you.
[451:15.62]Appreciate it.
[451:16.08]Thanks for the $15.
[451:16.64]This feels really weird.
[451:18.42]I'm not going to lie.
[451:19.08]This is fucking freaking me out.
[451:22.52]I'm talking to somebody, but I'm not talking to them.
[451:29.14]Thank you.
[451:29.60]SomethingAurota for the 250.
[451:30.40]Yeah, moderating a channel is hard.
[451:32.96]It's... They do their best.
[451:33.62]They're trying.
[451:59.11]But sometimes there are a lot of people here and it's hard to manage that many people.
[452:02.93]It just is.
[452:06.17]But they do try.
[452:07.17]They are trying.
[452:10.92]Thank you something or other for the $2.50.
[452:12.64]Appreciate it.
[452:16.58]Next we have Internet Jorge for $25.
[452:18.52]Thank you, Internet Jorge.
[452:20.02]$25.
[452:20.04]Thank you.
[452:25.31]Streamer blames boomer cough on cold.
[452:27.27]Cheer 1,000.
[452:27.59]Cheer 1,000.
[452:27.87]Cheer 100.
[452:28.33]Cheer 100.
[452:28.59]Cheer 100.
[452:28.89]Cheer 100.
[452:29.37]Cheer 100.
[452:29.67]Probably shouldn't copy and paste those parts.
[452:31.55]But thank you for the 25 bucks.
[452:32.75]It's a lot of money.
[452:33.44]Radbrews, thanks for the 250.
[452:52.94]Cheer 250 doing straight shots of lemon juice is actually way better than cough syrup.
[452:58.39]I don't know if I could do that, unfortunately, because I have digestive problems, and I think doing straight lemon juice would probably be a really bad thing for me to do.
[453:12.10]But vitamin C, that's what you're looking for, right?
[453:20.10]Okay, sorry.
[453:22.64]This next one is for Soul Harry.
[453:25.56]Thanks for the three, wow.
[453:26.96]Thanks for the $3, Soul Harry.
[453:31.21]I'm getting even, it's getting even worse.
[453:33.69]It's turning into, who is this?
[453:36.05]I don't know, this is a different voice now.
[453:39.05]Wow.
[453:41.39]I'm turning into Old Morty.
[453:43.59]Old Morty.
[453:48.89]We're gonna have to dial back.
[453:50.45]Oh, it's four people talking.
[453:53.68]Undo this and find the four people talking.
[453:56.20]Larry.
[453:56.90]Larry.
[453:57.72]You came over my house.
[453:59.28]And my wife is here.
[454:00.86]And you're going to talk about this swan.
[454:04.05]I don't want to talk about the swan, Larry.
[454:07.29]I just don't want to hear it anymore.
[454:10.11]We're trying to have a nice meal here with our families.
[454:13.49]And you keep bringing it up like an asshole.
[454:17.51]That's super, Dave.
[454:19.15]Got it.
[454:21.07]Anyways.
[454:25.30]Thank you, Sol Harry, for the three bucks.
[454:31.14]Solav100, Solav100, Solav100, Yerma.
[454:34.19]Question, I appreciate you wanting to upload highlights to second Yerma rather than your main channel.
[454:39.43]Yerma.
[454:39.89]But is there some reason that you feel you can upload videos like Meet the Albertsons to your main?
[454:45.07]They are basically the bigger projects you talk.
[454:49.43]Oh, I ran out of words.
[454:53.98]Alright, but basically, I'll just finish the rest of this.
[454:57.28]It's basically like the bigger projects I talked about.
[454:59.28]Just seems like over half a million subs are going to waste, so I have this question you're tired of answering.
[455:04.23]Whatever you do, you'll be the giant rat always.
[455:06.89]The thing about the YouTube channel, right, is it's almost like it's on ice, and it's a great archive of the shit that I used to do.
[455:15.88]And I've sort of transitioned and adapted over to Twitch and over to live content.
[455:22.56]But remember, I did the YouTube thing for five, six years.
[455:26.04]It was a long time.
[455:27.26]And I made a lot of videos.
[455:29.44]And the reason why something like the, you know, Meet the Elbertsons is not on the main channel is because in my mind, the original thought was...
[455:39.64]I will put video gaming and stream highlight stuff on the second channel and then spend a bunch of time on videos that I spend like two weeks on or a week on or whatever, three weeks on for the main channel.
[455:51.51]And what happened was I'm just one person and I ran out of time.
[455:56.95]I couldn't do it all.
[455:57.71]It was impossible.
[455:58.93]To stream three or four days a week and make a video that's been two or three weeks on, streaming wouldn't happen.
[456:05.82]I would have to take way more days off.
[456:07.20]I'd only be able to stream like once or twice a week.
[456:08.76]And I wanted to really give Twitch a real shot.
[456:13.06]And that also was in the same realm of, in the same time frame of YouTube really kind of shitting the bed for everybody.
[456:20.69]Ad revenue was down.
[456:22.09]Content ID was out of control.
[456:23.77]And I just figured, you know what, fuck it.
[456:25.13]I'm going to move on.
[456:27.09]And the second channel really exists to have a place for people that don't want to or can't watch entire streams.
[456:37.16]They're still able to stick around and watch videos of the jokes and the streams that happen still, you know?
[456:47.42]That's kind of the point of that second channel is to have a means for other people that can maybe not... I mean, this stream has been going on for almost eight hours.
[456:56.67]And a video that's 10 to 20 minutes is much easier for a lot of people to consume and still get the gist of kind of a lot of things that may have happened, right?
[457:07.57]But I never wanted to abandon the YouTube channel.
[457:10.72]That was never the point.
[457:12.26]It was always just... I mean, you saw Star tweeted about this a week ago or so.
[457:19.36]For the type of content that I want to make on YouTube, it's just not viable to do anymore.
[457:26.75]The amount of time it takes versus what you get out of it is... It's just hard to do now.
[457:32.96]And... Hold on.
[457:40.24]And unfortunately, unless you have like a big sponsorship or you have like a Patreon, which is another thing that I floated, but then I thought about it again.
[457:45.13]It's like, there are thousands of subs on this channel and like there's already a Patreon.
[457:50.21]It already kind of exists and it's people paying a month on here.
[457:56.04]You know, it's, hey, I'm going to pay you a Patreon once a month.
[457:58.88]And oh, by the way, I'm also going to be subscribed on Twitch too.
[458:01.77]It feels like double dipping people.
[458:03.37]And you know, I don't want to, I don't want to have like three different income revenues to try and bleed everybody dry because I want to make a YouTube video tomorrow.
[458:12.36]You know, this people are, you guys already pay me to make content, which is the streams, right?
[458:17.74]And I guess it is possible to do another Patreon, but I feel like you guys already pay.
[458:23.03]You guys already pay the fee in quotes.
[458:27.79]Why would I want to make you guys like pay again?
[458:29.53]Oh yeah, people pay $5 a month.
[458:31.49]Give me $5 a month too.
[458:36.62]And I don't even want to look at it like a fee to, you know, watch the content.
[458:39.47]I want the content to always be free, always accessible, always people that you don't have to pay them any money to hang out here and watch, right?
[458:46.27]I never want that.
[458:50.81]But streams started to take that, the time that I was going to put into stuff on YouTube turned into stuff that I put a bunch of time on in Twitch.
[458:58.82]And I've done it a few times already this year and even last year.
[459:01.96]And once the summertime rolls around, you're going to see a lot more of that.
[459:06.54]Oh, we're going to be in the studio this week and we're doing something interesting.
[459:11.03]You know, the weather's starting to get nicer.
[459:12.31]There's more opportunities to do stuff.
[459:14.63]And you'll be seeing a lot of that in the summer.
[459:17.81]So the time and energy and resources and money that was going to go into the main YouTube channel is just here now.
[459:26.89]Hopefully that makes sense.
[459:31.60]But really appreciate it.
[459:32.56]Thank you.
[459:34.22]And the main channel at this point, I'm only going to, I'd rather even probably call it like the archive channel.
[459:40.12]Because it would have to take some, there would have to be some reason why I would go back and make another video that I spend like a week or two on.
[459:55.06]Voice is sounding a little better now.
[459:56.20]Yeah, it's starting to even out, but it still sounds like shit.
[460:01.52]It's like barely at that point where it might fall back into Joan Rivers.
[460:10.15]But, we're good.
[460:13.13]Alright, fuck this text-to-speech, I'm fine.
[460:16.77]Thank you, Sly161, for the 250.
[460:18.35]Hey, Jerm, I'm not sure if this is ass already, but do you know if we're gonna get a three-year subscriber badge?
[460:23.80]I just hit three years this month.
[460:25.44]Keep up the great streams.
[460:26.36]That's insane.
[460:27.92]Yeah, I just, I gotta get in touch with Blordow.
[460:29.70]I gotta talk to him.
[460:30.48]I gotta, like, send the message.
[460:31.97]I just haven't been around.
[460:36.50]But yes, there's gonna be three-year, four-year, there's gonna be cheer emotes, there's gonna be new emotes, there's gonna be new channel artwork, channel animations, the whole thing's gonna get done.
[460:46.00]I just have to... Yeah, I'll probably do that.
[460:48.02]I'll probably reach out to him tomorrow.
[460:51.86]But yeah, that's... There you go.
[460:53.16]That's what we're doing.
[460:55.34]Hey, cadbtv, thanks for the $2.50.
[460:57.61]The hardest thing to do in life is fart without shitting your pants.
[461:03.11]I don't think that's... That's really not that hard.
[461:10.14]It's not that hard.
[461:13.47]Thank you, Dorkube, for the 250.
[461:14.67]I know this game has made you mad, but holy hell, some of these noises you made while fighting the long swordsman made me bust a gut so bad.
[461:21.57]That's just the nature of the game, though.
[461:22.61]I love this game.
[461:24.54]Don't take my frustration and anger and shit-talking as a I don't like what I'm doing.
[461:31.34]I love this game.
[461:32.12]It's great.
[461:32.88]It's fantastic.
[461:34.48]It's so fucking hard.
[461:36.15]It's so different.
[461:36.85]It's so... Ugh.
[461:39.76]It's refreshing to lose over and over again and not be able to fall back on the shit that you used to do in their other games.
[461:45.65]Because I would just dodge.
[461:47.53]Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[461:49.08]I-frame, I-frame, I-frame, I-frame.
[461:51.22]Here comes... He's going to swing seven times in a row.
[461:53.80]I-frame, I-frame, I-frame, I-frame, I-frame, I-frame, swing, swing, swing.
[462:04.42]But I will keep my final assessment of the game until I get further or I beat it, right?
[462:11.64]That's how everybody played.
[462:12.56]Yeah, now you can't do that anymore.
[462:15.22]You have to block, you have to parry, you have to dodge certain attacks, and it changes everything.
[462:21.30]It throws your brain into... It snowballs it down until the snowball's huge, and then you die three times.
[462:29.84]Music's muted?
[462:30.47]Oh, shit, right.
[462:32.15]Thanks for that.
[462:34.72]Callie Brady, thanks for the $25, Callie Brady.
[462:37.86]25 bucks.
[462:38.56]Hey, Jerma, glad to see you enjoying Sekiro.
[462:40.46]Sekiro.
[462:42.08]I've never had the patience for Soulsborne games, so I have to enjoy you through it.
[462:46.56]Keep the fun coming.
[462:48.06]For sure.
[462:50.20]I'm going to try my hardest to complete the game on stream.
[462:55.24]That's exactly what we're going to be doing when I come back the day after tomorrow.
[463:02.62]Thank you.
[463:04.75]Literally what we were just talking about.
[463:05.75]But watching you play this is genuinely beautiful at times.
[463:24.28]Yeah, I'm trying to, because for me, I'm just trying to time parries and not get hit by moves and dodge.
[463:31.95]But I imagine from a viewer's standpoint, it actually looks pretty cool when you land two or three good parries and a dodge and then a reversal.
[463:39.66]Probably looks cool.
[463:43.91]It feels really good to play, too.
[463:45.09]It's not sloppy.
[463:46.23]The camera is really... That's a complaint for every FromSoftware game.
[463:51.11]But a game that's this fast and this visceral, that's... I remember I told you about my two gripes with the game.
[463:58.41]One is the camera, because sometimes it really just spins in circles and gets locked somewhere.
[464:05.21]But that's pretty much it.
[464:07.73]It's a pretty minor complaint, like I was telling you.
[464:11.82]I think it's great.
[464:14.67]The thing is, you can get over that really quickly.
[464:17.21]It's not something that's a game-breaker.
[464:21.39]But thank you, Smellyboy.
[464:24.65]Thank you, MangosEvoWins, for the $10.
[464:29.19]Thank you, Mango.
[464:31.07]They say, long time fan since 2010.
[464:32.67]I've seen most of your YouTube videos on your main and second channel.
[464:35.05]Just thought I'd hop over to Twitch and give you some cash.
[464:36.99]Well, thank you.
[464:39.75]Thank you, thank you, thank you. 2010.
[464:45.65]What am I gonna do for my 10-year anniversary for being online?
[464:49.23]What am I gonna do?
[464:51.38]I have to do something for 10 years of YouTube and Twitch?
[464:55.64]That's a big deal for me.
[464:57.16]That's a big deal for me, being able to stick to something like that for this long.
[465:04.78]I can't believe and can't imagine that I would be doing the same thing, doing this still, for 10 years.
[465:15.62]I could barely do anything for six months straight, let alone ten fucking years.
[465:22.56]Rent a pony.
[465:25.40]But thank you, Mango, for the ten dollars.
[465:26.55]Really appreciate it.
[465:28.03]Well, I've been trying to swing at him randomly.
[465:56.73]Sorry, that was a big one.
[465:59.83]That was a big one.
[466:01.81]But yeah, I'll check more often.
[466:03.65]It seems like some of them could... I could have seen maybe a few of them.
[466:08.34]Scooby-Doo walls.
[466:09.78]But thank you for the tip.
[466:12.62]And thanks for the $2.50.
[466:14.40]Ben Eleanor, thanks for the $25, Ben.
[466:16.32]$25, they say.
[466:18.59]You zap, please.
[466:21.53]I kind of did.
[466:22.09]I threw the zap right back in his face.
[466:26.91]But thank you so much, Ben, for the $25.
[466:28.09]Good old zap.
[466:32.03]Hugs, not drugs.
[466:32.95]Thanks for the $5.
[466:34.55]Close, my man.
[466:36.47]Close.
[466:38.43]I think that was the Gen Ichiro fight, right?
[466:42.13]That did come kind of close.
[466:43.55]I kind of did.
[466:45.69]Hey, Kamira, thanks for the $2.50.
[466:49.08]Lord Isshin is not within this castle.
[466:54.10]You could say that.
[466:54.74]I don't know where the hell I was going.
[466:55.88]I was so lost.
[466:59.98]Hey, Snooze and Cofter, thanks for the 250.
[467:02.68]Every time you play one of the new FromSoftware games, I actually play ahead so I can watch the stream.
[467:07.66]You take the route I didn't take.
[467:09.78]Same in Dark Souls 3, so now I gotta watch the VOD.
[467:12.90]I love all your Dark Souls and Demon's Souls streams, by the way.
[467:15.71]They always have a certain charm to it.
[467:17.35]Looking forward to watching the rest of the stream once I've progressed far enough.
[467:20.89]Sekiro is a blast, enjoy yourself.
[467:22.85]I'll see you when you've reached the temple, the monk temple.
[467:27.33]I'm looking forward to it.
[467:29.07]I'm looking forward to fucking scraping that off the bottom of my shoe after I stomp it.
[467:36.73]I'm gonna destroy that place.
[467:41.82]Hey!
[467:44.16]Thank you, compact viewer, for the $25.
[467:48.61]A lot of 25, 25, 25.
[467:50.07]You guys give me a lot of fucking money.
[467:51.99]Hey Jerma, I have two extra tickets to Star Wars Celebration because my only two friends bailed on me.
[467:57.02]Serious offer, no joke.
[467:58.72]Also great stream, as usual.
[468:02.00]Star Wars Celebration?
[468:05.60]What is Star Wars Celebration?
[468:10.32]Like Star Wars, like a movie?
[468:11.92]Or, oh wait, there's like, wait, the Star Wars in the opening of the Star Wars park.
[468:20.21]The opening... I'm sorry.
[468:21.11]I didn't mean that.
[468:21.83]I didn't come back.
[468:23.37]Sorry about that.
[468:25.25]Star Wars Park?
[468:26.45]In Disney?
[468:31.73]Well... Tell them to go!
[468:34.57]Why would they not go to that?
[468:39.49]But thank you for the $25.
[468:40.03]Hope you have fun.
[468:47.39]Seems cool.
[468:48.95]Because Star Wars sucks.
[468:50.09]Come on, get that out of here.
[468:51.95]I don't want to see that.
[468:54.49]Hey, Tingy, thanks for the $2.50.
[468:56.02]You might actually have to do one or five dollars per death for scratch tickets.
[469:00.76]I went back through yesterday's stream and counted the deaths.
[469:02.76]It was 34.
[469:04.96]Jess, you got it, and I kept count today, and it was 44.
[469:08.08]If a mod is around and wants to make a death counter, you're at 78 deaths total.
[469:14.75]So, one dollar scratch tickets.
[469:16.67]Let's go.
[469:18.86]Why not?
[469:19.94]It's going to take so long to scratch.
[469:25.00]No, it has to be.
[469:27.10]It's got... I don't even know what to do about that.
[469:30.36]Am I going to scratch like 150 scratch tickets on stream?
[469:37.56]I don't think that's going to... That'll take like four hours.
[469:42.71]We're going to have to condense these a little.
[469:47.42]I'm still gonna do it, but instead of $1 per death, it's gonna be, you know, a $5 ticket.
[469:53.23]So I don't have to sit there for like six hours scratching $1 tickets.
[470:00.17]But thank you.
[470:01.29]Thank you Flying Sombrero for the $2.50, the first video in years, and the last video to your main channel should be One Last Otto's Big Adventure.
[470:09.12]That's only 20 to 30 seconds long.
[470:11.46]One final send-off from Otto.
[470:19.03]A final auto send-off.
[470:22.35]I don't know about that.
[470:25.19]Here comes the credits.
[470:25.87]These are tonight's subs and resubs.
[470:27.17]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[470:32.59]Thank you for your continued support of the channel.
[470:34.17]You guys are fucking amazing.
[470:34.99]Thank you.
[470:35.29]What?
[470:37.56]Didn't somebody say this like an hour, two hours ago?
[470:48.15]But thank you.
[470:49.93]That one felt... That one felt the most involved.
[470:51.79]I felt like I was actually winning and beating that boss.
[470:53.49]The ball was cool.
[470:54.45]But a little all over the place.
[471:16.12]The butterfly lady was cool, was interesting too.
[471:20.96]That'd be hard to think about.
[471:22.92]The horseman was really cool.
[471:26.34]They were all just generally interesting fights.
[471:29.89]With something different going on.
[471:33.01]But the Genichiro fight, it felt more like I was having a real sword fight with somebody, with the Genichiro fight.
[471:42.67]But that's going to wrap it up.
[471:45.12]Uh, special thanks to Danes Gaming for the raid.
[471:51.63]Thank you.
[471:54.25]Good luck to you if you're playing, uh, Sekiro, if you come across this.
[471:59.77]Wish you the best of luck.
[472:03.55]And that's my time.
[472:04.37]I'll see you guys.
[472:04.97]Yeah, I'm going to take tomorrow just because I... I feel like if I stream tomorrow and do some more screaming, that I might have to go out of commission for like four or five days or something.
[472:14.09]I will, like, fuck up my voice.
[472:18.16]So I'll see you guys on... On Monday.
[472:23.38]I'll update the sauce and everything, so... We'll go from there.
[472:31.07]You're allowed to take tomorrow off only if you talk to Florida.
[472:39.84]I will don't worry.
[472:49.31]Get well.
[472:50.43]Thank you.
[472:53.03]Oh, I'm gonna take a... You know, I was supposed to take a bath last night.
[472:55.55]I'm gonna take a bath tonight.
[472:56.81]Tonight's the bath night.
[473:00.90]Good stream?
[473:01.70]No, I had a blast.
[473:02.94]It was great.
[473:04.04]I loved it.
[473:09.81]Oh, you mean stream the bathtub.
[473:11.61]Stream myself in the bathtub.
[473:13.19]I'm not going to do that.
[473:14.11]I'm not going to break the terms of service.
[473:20.99]Have a wonderful rest of your weekend, everybody.
[473:24.90]See you real soon.
[473:25.98]Take care.
[473:26.82]Ta-ta.
[473:30.87]Farewell for now.
[473:32.69]Oh, and by the way, I didn't even mention it.
[473:34.05]Go follow Dan's Gaming.
[473:36.85]He's one of the fucking grandfathers of all live streaming.
[473:47.02]If you aren't already.
[473:51.73]Take care, guys.
[474:08.96]you
