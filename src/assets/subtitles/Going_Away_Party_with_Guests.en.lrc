[00:16.82]No, we don't have an intro anymore.
[00:19.04]There is no intro.
[00:20.94]Not anymore.
[00:24.48]Yeah, hold on, hold on.
[00:26.52]Hold on a second here.
[00:27.68]We've got a lot to talk about today.
[00:30.33]A lot.
[00:32.69]Here we go.
[00:33.39]Jump scare.
[00:33.95]Oh, right, right, right.
[00:34.51]Because I just turned it on.
[00:38.35]I do forget just how great it is to have an intro.
[00:43.11]Because when I turn a stream on, it's just like...
[00:47.31]Oh, hi.
[00:48.07]Yeah, it's me.
[00:49.45]Usually there's like music and cartoon characters.
[00:53.19]But we will... We'll talk about this in just a minute here, but if you guys don't know, I just tweeted it out.
[01:00.22]Let's wait.
[01:01.48]Wait like two minutes.
[01:03.50]Is that cider?
[01:04.78]No.
[01:06.10]That's champagne.
[01:08.18]I wanted to do something a little bit more special today, just today, because it is the last stream...
[01:14.96]It is the final stream from this house.
[01:18.08]So... I'm eating sunflower seeds.
[01:20.71]Sorry.
[01:23.41]I barely ate today.
[01:24.45]So I've been trying to snack.
[01:27.17]Sunflower seeds.
[01:28.11]Delicious.
[01:29.13]I highly recommend them.
[01:30.49]But yeah, the last stream from this place.
[01:32.23]This is the last one.
[01:33.09]Am I in the right category?
[01:39.23]They suck?
[01:40.05]What?
[01:41.96]How could you say that sunflower seeds suck?
[01:46.09]They're like oily and salty like what?
[01:49.94]Last stream ever no no no no this is the final stream from this place After tonight the Internet's getting turned off and then it's time to go to Vegas man So I want to do something special like I said so today Not only are there going to be Quite a few special guests That's right.
[02:10.58]Why do you think I have all this shit set up back here?
[02:13.42]special guests
[02:15.24]Some people you may have seen on the channel before are going to make a triumphant return.
[02:21.56]So first of all, though, I do want to say we are going to start with something else.
[02:26.74]I have not checked my mail in about, I don't know, it's been like a rough, pretty much a rough week or two here.
[02:32.97]So I barely checked my mail.
[02:35.05]We're going to go over, I got some birthday cards, it looks like.
[02:37.95]I got some well wishes cards.
[02:39.93]I'd like to go over them.
[02:41.33]So, and right, we got, hold on, we got five community subs here.
[02:46.25]From Kazzy.
[02:46.99]Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs.
[02:50.32]This is pre-recorded.
[02:51.06]It's not.
[02:53.32]Tax stream incoming.
[02:56.86]You want me to prove it?
[02:59.18]Somebody tell me to do something.
[03:01.90]Tell me to do something.
[03:04.38]No one said that.
[03:05.12]Quick, shake my arms.
[03:06.40]What do you want me to do?
[03:08.14]I'm not going to eat ass.
[03:10.34]Why would I do that?
[03:10.90]That's illegal to do on this stream and I would not do it in the first place.
[03:16.91]And I just, why the fuck did I even respond to that?
[03:19.37]Chunky baloney gave out 10 community subs right here.
[03:23.93]I'm not going to dab either.
[03:25.45]You can write your fucking nose wipe.
[03:27.25]You can wipe your damn nose for all I care.
[03:30.77]10 jumping jacks.
[03:31.39]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[03:31.97]There you go.
[03:33.59]You just saw my like fucking sweat stains.
[03:35.22]That's great.
[03:39.18]No, we're not doing a house tour.
[03:40.10]Look, I have mail.
[03:42.06]I have mail here and I'd like to go over it.
[03:45.46]I figured it would be a fun thing to do on stream because it's the final time you're going to see me, right?
[03:50.28]Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:51.48]I mean like, I mean like from this house, not like ever.
[03:55.03]I'm talking about from this location.
[03:56.09]They're going to be another stream here.
[03:58.21]Anyways, this is to me.
[04:00.79]Let's see what it is.

[09:13.10]Is that real?
[09:16.98]I owe $44.
[09:19.17]I've been trying to contact you since August of 2017.
[09:21.57]Is that a real law?
[09:26.56]That's not a real law, is it?
[09:29.46]If I open up a mail and it's a bill, do I have to pay?
[09:32.06]I didn't see it though, but I did just see it.
[09:34.30]They knew what they were fucking doing.
[09:45.55]I'm going to delete the VOD.
[09:46.41]This is what has to happen.
[09:49.23]Thank you everybody.
[09:50.57]All the well wishes that I got from friends and family members.
[09:54.62]Thank you all for those things.
[09:56.24]That's just wonderful.
[09:58.60]But regardless, like who gives a shit about any of that?
[10:01.41]I'm dropping fucking seeds everywhere.
[10:07.15]Okay, so let's explain what's going on back here.
[10:11.57]I've got some champagne.
[10:13.29]I've got some fun glasses with the stars in them for fun.
[10:16.67]And I've got the joke bell.
[10:19.31]And I figured maybe it'd be fun.
[10:20.37]It'd be really funny thing to do if I could get some people here and we could go to reminisce on funny things I've done over the last two years of the channel.
[10:28.41]And if you remember something, you got to hit that bell.
[10:31.12]You know what I mean?
[10:32.10]And we can laugh about it.
[10:33.18]Anytime there's a joke that's made for the remainder of the stream, we're going to press that button.
[10:37.10]so uh they all should be showing up fairly soon here I would assume over the next and I told them all uh like five o'clock uh you know you got to give somebody like a half an hour that's what I say you know I mean 30 minutes I think is okay anything longer than that you got to start to wonder like hey like you're a little late but it's alright uh we got might as well try I don't even do I even
[11:03.63]I don't even know how to open these.
[11:05.53]I have no idea how to open a bottle of champagne.
[11:08.27]Like, not a single clue.
[11:12.11]Just clean this shit.
[11:17.28]Got a text here, hold on.
[11:22.12]Who the fuck is texting me right now?
[11:25.58]No, I can't.
[11:27.90]Hey, sorry dude, I'm running late.
[11:29.54]Okay, well that's fine.
[11:31.28]That's okay, he-

[12:07.87]No, he's been screaming in the backseat.
[12:09.48]That's fine.
[12:11.40]No, it's okay.
[12:11.88]Maybe you can come over tomorrow or something.
[12:16.88]Alright, yeah.

[12:20.99]Alright, dude.
[12:22.03]Thanks a lot.

[12:33.54]The favorite doctor's going to be here.
[12:34.72]The scary Goosebumps guy's going to be here.

[13:37.74]Just hold on a second here.
[13:40.52]Just wait.
[13:41.78]I planned this for the last week.
[13:43.89]And all these people told me they made sure that their schedules were open and that I was going to be able to do this shit.
[13:48.67]Okay?
[13:49.78]Don't tell me that you're going to show up to a party and not fucking show up and call me 10 minutes, 30 minutes late and then say that you can't go.
[13:57.35]That's absolutely fucking ridiculous.
[14:04.12]There's one more person that I need to fucking get in contact with because... Are you... God fucking damn it.
[14:16.34]Hey, let me guess.
[14:17.04]You're not going.
[14:17.93]You're not going, are you, Burgah Boy?
[14:20.49]That's just wonderful.
[14:21.73]Yeah.
[14:22.35]Great.
[14:25.15]I don't care how far away you live.
[14:26.69]You told me you were going to do this shit.
[14:28.01]Alright.
[14:28.49]I gotta go.
[14:28.99]Bye.
[14:30.09]Bye.
[14:35.01]Fuck.
[14:35.77]Okay.
[14:39.21]Sometimes a party gets canceled.
[14:41.09]But I don't cancel parties.
[14:46.40]Just give me one fucking second.
[14:47.46]Hold on.
[14:47.78]Don't go anywhere.
[14:51.86]Just wait a minute.
[14:52.98]I'm fucking having a party whether I like it or not.
[15:00.02]Give me one second.
[15:01.02]One minute.
[16:20.69]Like the other two other neighbors weren't responding.
[16:26.74]So just sit over here.
[16:27.58]I just need some help with something real quick.
[16:29.82]Just have a seat over there.
[16:32.84]Thank you for answering the door, by the way.
[16:34.22]That was really nice of you.
[16:35.36]Okay.
[16:37.27]Um, just change this.
[16:42.63]Do you like, do you like champagne?
[16:45.88]No.
[16:46.42]Yeah, I just need to... Let me just... So this is my neighbor.
[16:49.95]He's... Neighbor Gil.
[16:52.93]Your name's Gil, right?
[16:53.89]Who are you talking to?
[16:56.51]We're doing a video feed here.
[16:57.87]I just wanted to worry about it.
[16:59.29]I got a couple of questions for you.
[17:00.83]I got two or three questions for you.
[17:02.15]Alright?
[17:03.53]First question is, what's it like to be Jerma985's neighbor?
[17:07.80]Huh?
[17:11.16]Jerma985?
[17:11.50]Yeah.
[17:12.50]Huh?
[17:14.66]Very good.
[17:15.98]Yeah.
[17:17.36]Always loud.
[17:19.76]And that's what we call a joke there, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:22.20]That's a pretty good joke.
[17:24.00]That's the joke bell.
[17:24.72]Anytime you say something funny, you gotta press the button, because that was funny.
[17:28.70]Do you know how to open this?
[17:30.48]Yeah.
[17:33.16]Just nice and slow, just so people can... I want it to go pop, too, you know?
[17:37.18]I want it to go like... So what would you say is your favorite moment of my channel, would you say?
[17:42.46]I don't know.
[17:44.76]What channel?
[17:45.26]TV channel?
[17:46.02]My favorite TV channel?
[17:47.36]Yeah.
[17:47.66]What's your favorite TV channel?
[17:51.06]ESPN.
[17:52.40]You're a fan of the... I don't follow sports.
[17:55.05]Is it the... Boston has a team, right?
[17:58.03]Yeah, they have one.
[17:59.39]How many teams does Boston have?
[18:00.49]Just open it and... Be careful now.
[18:03.23]I didn't make a joke, though.
[18:05.03]Just be careful.
[18:06.34]I don't want to make it take somebody's life.
[18:20.29]Hey!
[18:22.23]Wasn't that funny?
[18:23.59]That was a funny joke.
[18:25.41]Hey, do you want a glass of this?
[18:28.13]No, thanks.
[18:31.01]And that's just delicious stuff.
[18:33.73]So, about me, right?
[18:35.01]About my channel.
[18:36.63]Would you say that I'm more a stand-up comedian or a gotcha comedian?
[18:42.77]What would you call me?
[18:45.15]If you had to guess.
[18:46.93]A terrible neighbor.
[18:51.15]Okay, well, that's great and all.
[18:53.85]Do you eat seeds?
[18:54.47]No.
[18:56.65]No, you don't?
[18:57.15]Okay.
[18:58.25]So what was the worst thing I've ever done, then, if I'm so inclined to ask?
[19:02.94]You don't do anything.
[19:04.12]Your yard's a mess.
[19:06.52]There's a smell coming from your house.
[19:08.62]We've called, I think, three times.
[19:11.60]You haven't done anything about it.
[19:12.96]Your weeds are growing everywhere.
[19:16.49]But, I mean, of all the things that I've said to you, how fun were they?
[19:27.23]Okay, could you look at the light before you go?
[19:29.98]I mean, I think you've obviously got your eye.
[19:35.44]Yeah, just got home from work.
[19:37.68]Cool.
[19:39.54]The toilet upstairs next door.
[19:41.86]I got my kids next door.
[19:44.54]Just look at the toilet upstairs before you.
[19:45.86]Could you do that and the lights?
[19:46.96]I know you're a contractor.
[19:49.24]No, I can't.
[19:51.87]Hey, thanks for coming to the party.
[19:54.48]What a great guy here.
[19:56.74]Yeah, you're welcome.
[19:57.92]Yeah, I'll see you.
[19:58.76]Alright, see you later.
[20:04.92]Go.
[20:05.86]Well, you could go that way.
[20:06.74]Don't fuck this up, man.
[20:09.26]I'm just kidding, boy.
[20:12.08]Got it.
[20:17.64]The world is fun when you have it.
[20:22.31]Uh, well, here's the thing.
[20:25.73]I got another guest for you.
[20:28.29]I got another guest.
[20:33.51]Kim!
[20:35.79]Kim!
[20:48.28]Yeah, it's not a big deal.
[20:49.10]Just...
[20:51.36]You know how people are, right?
[20:52.64]They cancel on you and all the stupid shit.
[20:55.40]Just come over here.
[20:56.68]Welcome to the party.
[20:58.82]Right over there.
[20:59.28]Just sit right there.
[21:03.72]So, uh... Hey, Kim!
[21:06.66]This is my girlfriend, Kim, if you don't know.
[21:08.88]We're going to Vegas soon.
[21:11.26]Say hi, if you could.
[21:13.12]Oh, hi.
[21:14.17]Right.
[21:14.55]Make sure you say hello to him.
[21:16.67]But anyways, well...
[21:19.93]There is some stress going on here with the move, obviously.
[21:24.57]And if you were to take a guess, what do you think is my favorite stream I've ever done?
[21:35.92]What would you say?
[21:36.36]I don't know.
[21:39.64]Maybe your paint stream?
[21:41.20]Maybe.
[21:41.46]Maybe.
[21:42.36]Stand up for a second.
[21:44.71]Do you see that?
[21:45.21]I just want to make sure I got that.
[21:49.26]Let's get this here.
[21:52.52]Look, do you see that?
[21:53.82]Try to get that for me.
[21:56.31]Do you not see that?
[21:57.71]Because I've got to put it in my sunflower seed case.
[22:01.65]I've been dropping them on the ground for the last, like, couple of minutes.
[22:06.81]Just make sure you can see it.
[22:07.65]Do you see it?
[22:10.18]What's wrong?
[22:13.74]Nothing.
[22:14.96]What do you mean?
[22:16.64]You good?
[22:18.86]Yeah, I
[22:25.06]You want, like, a drink or something?
[22:25.98]How you doing?
[22:30.79]Uh... Alright.
[22:32.11]How are you?
[22:33.33]I'm doing just fine.
[22:34.47]Alright.
[22:35.87]You wanna sit down or you wanna talk?
[22:37.41]What do you wanna do?
[22:40.91]What?
[22:41.05]You look all fucked up.
[22:41.75]What's going on?
[22:44.72]Nothing.
[22:45.14]You know, I'm really busy.
[22:47.28]I gotta take Otto for a walk.
[22:48.60]I gotta, like, you know... Yeah, okay.
[22:50.98]Clean up and stuff.
[22:52.32]You know, real busy upstairs.
[22:55.32]Yeah, go do what you gotta do.
[22:56.60]Thanks for coming to the party.
[22:57.70]Come here, honey.
[23:01.65]Thank you.
[23:03.33]Alright, let's go.
[23:04.91]Alright, see you later.
[23:06.51]Bye.
[23:09.11]What the fuck was that?
[23:12.30]That was fucking weird.
[23:23.46]What?
[23:47.36]Guys, we have no containers left.
[23:49.62]I don't have any way to put my shit.
[23:51.94]What am I supposed to do with my seeds?
[23:55.56]All the Tupperware is gone.
[23:56.70]All of our pots and pans are gone.
[23:59.06]I've got to make sure.
[24:00.32]My doctor told me I need to be snacking at least once an hour.
[24:15.45]Fucking ridiculous.
[24:16.21]What am I going to do with all this shit?
[24:25.63]Anyways.
[24:27.43]Tonight... Tonight we're going to play... We're going to play a game.
[24:33.84]We're going to play L.A.
[24:34.64]Noire.
[24:36.48]Thanks for coming to the last stream in the house party.
[24:38.54]We're going to go until the internet turns off.
[24:42.95]Why is everybody calling me such a bad person?
[24:50.97]I don't understand.
[24:52.53]Did I break some social rule or something?
[24:58.72]Alright, let's go.
[25:05.02]I got my PlayStation 4 right here.
[25:06.58]And we're going to play L.A.
[25:08.65]Noire.
[25:13.35]I'm a monster.
[25:14.13]I got nowhere to put my seeds.
[25:19.63]Cursed streamer.
[25:20.70]Why am I a cursed streamer?
[25:28.31]check the booze I drank like two sips out of there Bloodborne or pre I don't even have Bloodborne instead actually I do it's right here why do I look so ghastly today what did you say ghastly alright I gotta change this to la noir
[25:59.01]That's what we're actually playing.
[26:04.41]Well, that's all the memories I have for you.
[26:06.31]I really wanted, like, ten people to show up.
[26:10.56]But that's the way it fucking is.
[26:16.36]Nev, don't trust anybody, by the way.
[26:19.51]Oh, be there.
[26:20.23]No, you won't.
[26:20.85]Don't fucking lie to me.

[26:29.24]Okay, there it is.
[26:33.56]Open up LA Noire.
[26:35.54]We're gonna go right where we left off.
[26:36.86]By the way, what I said was true.
[26:39.62]We are going to stream until the internet gets turned off.
[26:42.70]So, I have, I don't know how long.
[26:44.82]It might be all night.
[26:45.76]It might be like... That's not gonna work.
[26:50.79]I gotta plug you into here.
[26:53.77]Chug the drink?
[26:55.85]Chug the drink.
[26:57.11]I don't chug drinks.
[27:03.00]What if they don't turn it off?
[27:05.20]Then we're gonna be live for quite a while.
[27:09.66]Oh my god, don't drop it.
[27:11.06]No, I'm fine.
[27:13.92]Let me plug this in.
[27:14.84]Sorry, guys.
[27:20.90]Ow.
[27:25.26]Wasn't that funny.
[27:27.61]I like that thing, though.
[27:28.57]I want to get rid of that.
[27:29.27]I'm gonna take that with me to Vegas.
[27:32.24]So, before we start, before we transition to L.A.
[27:34.74]Noire, I do want to tell you, thank you everybody.
[27:39.84]This is not the last stream until Vegas, but there's going to be like another one or two streams.
[27:43.99]But I started streaming here, right?
[27:48.53]And I'm moving on from this place.
[27:51.41]So, thank you for the journey of the last two and a half years or so.
[27:57.80]I started streaming with a schedule here.
[28:00.66]And we leave.
[28:02.76]In a few days.
[28:03.94]Four days, maybe?
[28:05.64]I don't know.
[28:07.58]Move you out of the way.
[28:09.36]Okay.
[28:13.09]I opened it.
[28:14.31]Might as well drink out of it.
[28:16.57]I'm going to transition from here to... I'd jail anywhere, right?
[28:22.95]That's the right thing?
[28:26.55]I believe it's...
