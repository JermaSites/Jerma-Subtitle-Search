[00:22.96]Oh, sorry.
[00:23.46]Hi, guys.
[00:27.12]It's fucking early.
[00:31.67]It's too hot.
[00:32.21]I can't drink this coffee.
[00:38.19]Alright.
[00:41.92]What time is it?
[00:42.62]It's time to go, right?
[00:44.12]I'm good.
[00:44.36]I thought it was just an Iron Man game.
[00:46.55]Sure.
[00:46.81]Just an Iron Man game.
[00:47.95]We're here.
[00:48.33]We're here.
[00:50.75]I've got to be quiet, though.
[00:52.41]Because everybody in the fucking house is sleeping right now.
[00:56.71]So I can't be loud.
[00:59.87]I've got to contain my joy.
[01:10.99]I can't be loud.
[01:13.93]Loud joke time?
[01:14.86]No.
[01:19.96]This shit is fucking... I seriously, like, made this too hot.
[01:26.12]This is the Nintendo... Yeah, this is the official Nintendo Direct Robe.
[01:33.84]I have to like this cool.
[01:34.66]It's like a fucking baked potato.
[01:36.65]What the fuck?
[01:39.04]Do I care about Nintendo?
[01:40.10]Yeah, I do.
[01:40.84]I have a Switch.
[01:42.62]It's literally in my bedroom.
[01:44.61]I play it all the time.
[01:46.49]Welcome to day three.
[01:51.71]Do I really?
[01:52.15]Yeah, I was playing Slay the Spire on it, like... 16 hours ago, whatever it was, like two nights ago.
[02:01.25]Two nights ago.
[02:02.53]Look at this hair back here.
[02:04.49]It's disgusting.
[02:07.97]What time is it in Vegas?
[02:08.99]It's 9am.
[02:10.29]Well, almost 9am.
[02:20.60]Do I play Smash?
[02:22.10]No, I don't.
[02:23.50]I'm not good enough.
[02:25.95]I got my ass kicked way too many times.
[02:27.85]Actually, it was like three times online and I decided I'm not doing this ever again.
[02:34.73]It shut me off of the game for the rest of my life.
[02:37.52]I do think it's a great game, though.
[02:42.68]I got juggled around... Actually, Etalyx and I played co-op together.
[02:48.33]And we went in, we practiced for a little bit, we were like, yeah, let's go.
[02:51.75]I'm ready to fucking go for it.
[02:53.31]We're gonna go online, we're gonna try to really win games.
[02:56.87]We got just so stomped so badly...
[03:01.38]Like three or four games in a row.
[03:02.58]We just were getting juggled around, thrown.
[03:04.26]It was just like embarrassing.
[03:05.68]And we just looked at each other.
[03:06.52]We were just like.
[03:06.98]I think I was the first person to say something.
[03:13.18]I think it was just like.
[03:15.72]Hey, I don't like you.
[03:16.88]Are you good?
[03:18.40]You look good.
[03:19.74]He's like, yeah.
[03:21.12]Yeah, I'm good.
[03:23.09]We just never played it ever again.
[03:24.49]And he got controllers for it, too.
[03:26.07]He was like completely prepared for it.
[03:29.48]It was like, I'm going to get the GameCube controllers.
[03:33.56]It was not good.
[03:34.66]It was bad.
[03:35.24]Yeah, I am being too loud, but whatever.
[03:42.38]Switch to the Nintendo stream.
[03:44.64]Is it coming up right now?
[03:49.09]Just watch it.
[03:49.63]I mean, it's going to transition over right now.
[03:54.91]Yeah, we're good.
[03:57.92]I also heard through some... I don't know how reliable sources... I don't think I'm allowed to stream things that are not on the official Twitch broadcast.
[04:11.37]So I think the AMD stream may have been illegal.
[04:19.71]So don't tell anybody.
[04:20.49]Alright, here we go.
[04:24.39]Here comes the Nintendo Direct.
[04:27.43]I'm excited.
[04:28.03]You're excited.
[04:30.35]I'm excited as I can be for waking up 15 minutes ago, 20 minutes ago.
[04:33.49]I thought that was my browser for a second.
[04:36.89]I was like, what the hell is happening?
[04:42.21]Those coordinates?
[04:46.89]The switch LA 3 10 20 20.
[04:48.59]Is that somebody's IP?
[04:52.11]Is that my IP?
[04:55.96]No, that's a lot of...
[04:59.20]Well, no, no, no, no, no!
[05:03.92]No, no, no, no, no!
[05:09.03]No!
[05:09.65]Oh, goddammit.
[05:13.81]Oh, thank god.
[05:14.75]I was gonna say, I was about to have to...
[05:23.69]Smash Brothers That was me
[05:59.27]And?
[06:00.72]Who is it?
[06:05.82]The hero draws near.
[06:23.21]so this this does this confirm this confirms all the leaks
[07:00.20]He's the only one left.
[07:12.10]Wait.
[07:21.39]So is all of them.
[07:23.15]It's the whole party.
[07:37.96]snooze like snooze it's like this is like Pok√©mon trainer is it no that's like final smash
[08:07.34]Dragon Quest Echoes of an Elusive Age S Definitive Edition.
[08:15.24]So I gotta say, I don't want any spoilers or anything or any leaks in the chat or anything like that, but I think that confirms all the characters on that list.
[08:25.34]Please do not put them in here.
[08:47.63]More monsters to ride.
[08:49.04]Monsters.
[08:50.50]Monsters.
[08:52.50]Good commentary.
[08:53.34]I'm just reading the text.
[08:55.46]It's so early.
[08:56.40]My brain can't even do anything.
[09:20.00]Well, I mean, I'm going to play it because... Hello, everyone.
[09:24.08]I'm Yoshiaki Koizumi from Nintendo.
[09:26.72]In this Nintendo Direct for E3 2019, we'll showcase a variety of games, many of them coming soon.
[09:34.08]But before we dig into the next game, there is someone I'd like to introduce first.
[09:40.70]What?
[09:41.46]What are you doing here?
[09:48.64]Oh, is that... Doug Bowser?
[09:49.28]They should've just had him talk through Bowser.
[09:52.05]That would've been great.
[09:53.31]If like, he's just like... That's just what he does.
[10:16.44]Not this way.
[10:17.86]No, no.
[10:18.90]This way.
[10:20.73]Bye-bye.
[10:22.07]Maybe next time.
[10:25.11]Are you related?
[10:27.25]No, but we get that a lot.
[10:31.94]Well, let's get back to it.
[10:33.40]Please, take it away.
[10:35.49]Poor Bowser.
[10:36.27]Hi, everyone.
[10:37.21]I'm Doug Bowser from Nintendo of America, and I'm thrilled to join you for today's Nintendo Direct.
[10:42.84]This is our chance to show the world we have games for every type of player on Nintendo Switch.
[10:48.60]Whether you love action, RPGs, or you're just looking for something new, I love Pac-Man.
[10:53.06]I got you covered.
[10:55.18]Okay.
[10:55.74]You got something for me, Doug?
[10:56.74]One of those games by taking a tour of Luigi's Mansion 3.
[11:02.09]Luigi's Mansion 3?
[11:04.94]Oh, shit.
[11:08.80]Hello?
[11:11.81]Mario.
[11:17.91]Luigi's invited to a gorgeous hotel with Mario, Peach and the others.
[11:24.48]Oh, lucky him.
[11:30.45]Luigi's Mansion 3.
[11:33.09]This hotel is much more than meets the eye.
[11:35.83]For not long after Luigi arrives, things take a dark turn.
[11:40.68]We begin our tour by taking in some sights and sounds.
[11:43.94]You may never leave.
[11:45.92]You want to leave.
[11:49.00]The other guests don't plan to move on.
[11:51.55]They're ghosts, after all.
[11:53.43]And they're rather aggressive.
[11:55.45]Simply scare them with the strobe bulb, then suck them up.
[11:59.42]Luigi's new Poltergust G-00 has the powerful suction capabilities required and other new features as well.
[12:09.40]It's like WWE stuff.
[12:36.27]I'm gonna chokeslam fruit.
[12:57.09]Professor Egad, namely Gooigi.
[13:00.73]Change between Luigi and Gooigi to use both their skills.
[13:05.00]Gooigi can do everything from slipping through metal fences to walking on spikes.
[13:11.52]Indeed, there are obstacles too great for Luigi to handle on his own.
[13:16.12]How do you make Gooigi?
[13:17.44]What's he made out of?
[13:18.10]Don't answer that.
[13:18.72]What?
[13:44.94]Of course they gotta have the toads.
[13:47.94]Oh, that's gonna be annoying.
[13:49.72]It's gonna fill your ears.
[14:03.57]15 people.
[14:04.17]Dark Souls.
[14:04.59]That's all I got.
[14:33.60]Good commentary.
[14:36.12]So that was Luigi's Mansion 3, the latest game in a series that I personally love.
[14:41.14]And we can look forward to seeing some of the new gameplay elements that await in this strange hotel as we dive deeper into this title on Nintendo Treehouse, live at E3 2019.
[14:50.74]We'll be streaming content, some you've never seen before, right from the show floor, including live gameplay of Super Mario Maker 2.
[15:00.81]And on day three, our Treehouse staff will get their hands on some promising indie games that are new to Nintendo Switch.
[15:07.73]While you watch today's Nintendo Direct, keep an eye out for this icon to learn what other games will appear on Nintendo Treehouse.
[15:14.00]Oh, shit.
[15:14.72]No, that's me.
[15:15.68]I gotta move me.
[15:16.38]I like them.
[15:16.74]I like them.
[15:28.22]Ogre slept too long.
[15:30.73]Far too long.
[15:32.63]Oh, this is the Dark Crystal, right?
[15:37.17]Thra!
[15:37.81]No!
[15:41.85]What have they done?
[15:45.45]Avarice unchecked for an age.
[15:48.05]Are they doing a Dark Crystal game?
[15:51.17]Darkness spreads.
[15:54.58]Now that's a go.
[15:56.04]Strategy game!
[16:02.24]Yeah, the Dark Crystal's coming back.
[16:12.73]It's on Netflix.
[16:14.57]It's like a TV show.
[16:15.61]Soon.
[16:16.09]It's a little tie-in game. ...
[16:33.62]I'm definitely not going to play it, but I'll probably watch the show.
[16:43.93]Lost ashore, a strange land, a castaway will seek the truth.
[16:49.19]Animal Crossing?
[16:57.13]Only first he must awaken.
[17:07.78]Can Link escape Koholint Island?
[17:12.21]This is Link Treasure Tracker?
[17:15.29]They're finally giving Link a Toad game.
[17:16.87]Oh, no they're not.
[17:17.65]This looks cute.
[17:38.60]I'd love to see a StarTropics revival here.
[17:50.38]You can make your own dungeon?
[18:09.97]That's really cool You can just make your own dungeons Zelda maker That's cool
[18:39.57]Giant egg?
[18:42.56]What's the egg?
[18:50.81]It's the egg.
[18:51.57]No, but what is the egg?
[19:26.53]Never know what to say what for these games because I have no I have no idea what I would even say Every time I think of something to say I'm always just like I Know I don't know
[19:47.17]They're probably fun games, but I always just find myself going like... The meta games were fun, though.
[20:09.72]Later today, they're just rolling them out, huh?
[20:24.63]Wait, The Witcher?
[20:25.29]Is The Witcher actually coming to Switch?
[20:46.30]You know what?
[20:46.80]I'm excited for that.
[20:49.03]For one reason only.
[20:50.59]I've never played The Witcher 3 because I don't want to sit at my desk for 400 hours.
[20:54.61]I'll lie in bed for 400 hours.
[20:56.23]I already have.
[20:57.69]Let's all agree to meet back at the monastery exactly five years from today.
[21:01.77]Like a class reunion?
[21:03.19]You will come, won't you?
[21:08.11]Years ago, we fought here as classmates.
[21:11.72]As big class reunions go, this one's gotta be the worst in history.
[21:16.92]What should we do, Teach?
[21:18.64]Kill every last one of them!
[21:23.99]Somebody said something funny.
[21:26.43]I'll wait till after the movie.
[21:32.41]Still, we have no choice but to eliminate those who cling to unreasonable ideas of justice.
[21:39.26]Someone must put a stop to this cycle of the strong trampling the weak.
[21:43.66]This sort of hellstorm consumes even the darkness itself.
[21:51.65]Yet we have the strength to scale the walls between us, to reach out our hands, so we can open our true hearts to one another.
[21:59.56]That's how we win!
[22:01.58]Just do that from the beginning.
[22:02.90]Teacher, both sides of time are revealed to you.
[22:06.78]What shall you do?
[22:16.53]How lovely it would be for this moment to last forever.
[22:23.51]You can click that, but I don't think you can.
[22:25.13]I don't think it's clickable on MySpace.
[22:29.41]Nintendo Switch is the only gaming console you can play, not only on your TV at home, but anywhere you go.
[22:35.55]Best part.
[22:37.15]That's why it's so good.
[22:38.53]With a system like this, it might be fun to play Resident Evil at a location like this.
[22:45.92]What?
[22:51.78]You gonna play Resident Evil?
[22:54.13]Just play just in the doctor's office?
[22:58.73]No, that would have been funny.
[22:59.75]He like screams at the waiting room.
[23:15.37]Oh, uh, somebody said that, why do I only look the same for my E3 presentations, but I never look that way ever again?
[23:24.64]Because I get possessed by the fucking E.T.
[23:26.66]demon, the E3 demon.
[23:28.48]Okay.
[23:28.68]Let's do this.
[23:32.27]Resident Evil.
[23:39.43]Can you open it?
[23:40.59]Try it.
[23:41.64]Why would you walk into a scary place to play a horror game?
[23:44.76]This is like next level meta get- I wanna get scared.
[23:47.12]People are still like, oh I'm gonna go walk around at night in a scary abandoned mansion.
[23:54.39]But I'm gonna bring my switch this time and instead of exploring the scary mansion, we're gonna like play the switch in the scary mansion.
[24:02.52]Why don't you- why don't you explore the scary mansion?
[24:10.65]Is this like the zoomer?
[24:11.87]Is this like the new zoomer, how to get scared?
[24:35.24]Well, one of those is a really good game.
[24:47.77]playing a Resident Evil game in a place like that might not be my way to play but I bet you could find your way to play don't you think that on the bathroom on the toilet every time please take a look I've only played the switch lying in bed and while I'm in the bathroom that's my only way I played was today the fourth of July if not is the empire striking back or what
[25:16.31]Looks like things are gonna get weird today.
[25:18.27]What the hell?
[25:35.69]Get down!
[25:38.19]Oh man.
[25:38.63]Oh, come on.
[25:39.25]Have it be real.
[25:40.58]Have this be real.
[25:42.30]Not some shitty top-down game.
[25:43.62]Have this be real.
[25:44.20]Please.
[26:03.47]No more heroes.
[26:05.41]No more heroes 3.
[26:07.97]Oh, that's a- I'm so far- I can't wait.
[26:27.14]They didn't show shit, and there's nothing here.
[26:29.08]But, like, in a couple of years or whatever.
[26:31.54]Welcome back, Travis, to the Garden of Madness.
[26:34.74]These games were batshit.
[26:36.90]They were insane.
[26:40.08]I'm excited for that.
[26:40.74]That actually is hopefully gonna be good.
[26:42.54]Because they came up with that, like, Travis touchdown, virtual reality top-down.
[26:46.02]That thing was... What the hell was that?
[26:48.46]He led an elite team of Contras during war.
[26:51.86]Hungry beast!
[26:53.33]HB is actually a cyborg.
[26:55.15]I love him so much.
[26:56.95]This is Ms.
[26:57.49]Harakiri and her alien gut bucket.
[27:00.25]They survive by merging together during the alien wars.
[27:04.47]The gentlemen, the sweetest bug you'll ever meet.
[27:08.32]Soiled by Allah!
[27:19.87]There it is.
[27:20.41]There's more of it.
[27:23.74]The world sucks!
[27:25.92]All the time!
[27:27.60]You know what I'm saying?
[27:28.34]Imagine just, like, living in a fucking hut somewhere, like, in these worlds.
[27:41.11]It's like, the world sucks!
[27:46.58]Oh, I wish I was living in the Harry Potter universe!
[27:50.11]You know how many fucked up shitty worlds there are that have been made?
[27:54.10]People say, oh, I want to get reincarnated as a butterfly.
[27:57.38]You're going to be an ant.
[27:59.06]There's like 900 billion of them.
[28:00.84]You're going to get in one of those worlds.
[28:02.28]Not Harry Potter.
[28:02.99]Harry Potter.
[28:23.57]Reincarnate into Harry Potter.
[28:38.76]No, I'm just making like... That's even rarer.
[28:44.88]That's like a hundred percent more rare.
[28:50.70]I was making the point that there's so many, like, fucked up shitty universes that, like, people want to live in the Harry Potter world.
[28:57.76]Well, you're gonna get reincarnated into, like, fucking... Gundam suit mobile game 2.
[29:03.28]Am I ins- are you hearing that?
[29:15.03]Am I insane or are you guys hearing this too?
[29:16.55]There's, like, two streams playing.
[29:29.45]Is this Panzer Dragoon?
[29:34.54]Holy shit!
[30:03.46]Yeah, I think it's the feed that I'm pulling because I don't have anything else going on.
[30:11.33]I'll play that.

[32:29.15]At this rate, all of humankind will be pulled into the Chimera's dimension.
[32:35.03]We're facing down the end of the world.
[32:40.04]Through blood, sweat, and years of research, we finally made it.
[32:46.36]The ultimate counter-Chimeric weapon.
[32:50.21]By neurologically syncing captured Chimeras with human operators, we established control.
[32:57.59]Cut the hell.
[32:59.99]Here's your 9am fucking commentary from Jerma985.
[33:05.17]what the hell I'll give you some parting advice your power what the hell nothing you think it is when a legion and a legion are perfect I can't stream it I don't care it's like they're two parts of one body no use the override release isn't going through that's impossible and when half of that body is about to die the legion's survival instincts kick in to save it
[33:32.04]No way.
[33:33.10]There's no way.
[33:34.92]What good could it possibly be?
[33:37.58]It's a long shot, but it's the only shot we have.
[33:40.28]It's all up to you, my friend.
[33:41.96]A blessing from the Legion.
[33:44.50]Or maybe I should say, a curse.
[33:50.24]We can't turn back now.
[33:53.27]I've got to know the whole truth.
[34:01.15]Why don't we just let him win?
[34:05.76]Is there ever a scenario where it's just like, yeah, just let the aliens win.
[34:08.90]We can't beat them.
[34:11.42]Just let them win, and then have something else happen.
[34:25.59]Destroy all humans.
[34:27.69]Yeah.
[34:29.31]Oh, wishy.
[34:43.74]It's like the original um like gangsters game I remember that game I think it was called actually I think it was called gangsters death by our hands is not an honor they have earned
[35:11.65]They deserve something much worse Even with this stone at my command this may not be a battle we can win Magneto has a stone we can beat it keep fighting
[35:36.83]That was Ultimate Alliance 3, isn't it?
[35:39.41]I actually am excited to play this.
[35:48.96]Alright.
[35:56.84]I got some... I might have some unpopular opinions here.
[35:58.94]I do.
[35:59.70]No, maybe I don't.
[36:00.74]But they probably are.
[36:04.11]Turn down your particle effects.
[36:07.28]They don't have... It just gets in the way.
[36:08.54]It's like Overwatch syndrome.
[36:10.06]You know what I mean?
[36:10.56]I don't... Just turn them down.
[36:11.72]Does it really... Does anybody care that much?
[36:15.57]That's what slows all these fucking games down to a crawl, is they have like 5,000 particle effects.
[36:21.69]I want to just turn them off.
[36:23.79]Well, give me an option to turn them off.
[36:34.56]It just looks messy.
[36:38.58]We want you to feel powerful and have explosions!
[36:41.41]Yeah, but, like, I already am powerful.
[36:44.53]I'm Tony goddamn Stark.
[36:46.15]I already know how powerful I am.
[36:47.29]You don't have to blow up my screen.
[36:49.43]This looks pretty cool.
[37:03.44]Oh, man.
[37:05.04]This is so cool.
[37:17.79]Zelda Crypt of the Necrodancer Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games 2020 I'm gonna be playing the shit out of this This is a boomer game
[37:48.51]Why?
[37:48.88]Because of the Olympics?
[38:12.22]Eggman really has such an odd body.
[38:14.52]He looks like an ant.
[38:16.42]Or like a spider.
[38:17.18]I think it looks pretty good.
[38:19.29]Follow-up info from... You guys get me for like five seconds.
[38:21.45]Animal Crossing.
[38:44.71]Animal Crossing hybrid.
[38:46.67]It runs off of electrical power.
[39:07.12]A flimsy axe, no.
[39:31.27]Aww.
[39:32.53]The snow.
[39:36.79]As I've gotten older, I've learned to appreciate these games way more.
[39:40.80]Oh, here's my reaction to this.
[39:52.24]Hooray.
[39:53.98]Right?
[39:54.20]That's it.
[39:54.92]That's all you have to say.
[39:58.52]There's no conflict.
[39:59.66]Just dead.
[39:59.96]Just conflict on its own right.
[40:01.66]Constant.
[40:03.16]The worst kind of conflict.
[40:05.72]The worst, most terrible conflict.
[40:26.49]We hope you look forward to the latest installment of Animal Crossing.
[40:33.66]On Nintendo Treehouse Live, the game's producer, Mr. Nogami, and the director, Ms.
[40:38.28]Kyogoku, will come on for a live demonstration of some early moments in the game, so please stick around until it starts.
[40:45.32]By the way, there are many different types of games coming to Nintendo Switch from Nintendo and our partners.
[40:52.10]So we've prepared a highlight reel to show you what's in store for 2019 and beyond Let's have a look they've got more shit to show they got some more stuff Oh god, it's probably gonna be re-releases Spyro
[41:30.37]I'm gonna play that.
[41:31.41]You can make fun of me all you want.
[41:34.41]I'm gonna play that a lot.
[41:38.59]What is this?
[41:39.09]You didn't see the Minecraft?
[41:43.97]This game will be fun too.
[41:49.47]This is some good shit.
[41:52.07]The stuff that I'm not supposed to be excited for is the stuff that I'm excited for at this E3, and it feels strange.
[41:58.28]Maybe it's because not very much was really shown here.
[42:01.30]All the AAA studios have made the same constant conflict game, and if we get this other stuff, it seems pretty cool.
[42:37.73]What is that?
[42:38.35]Three?
[42:39.44]Something three the game?
[42:40.76]I don't know why.
[42:54.00]I thought that was conquer.
[42:55.05]I was going to say, why would they not have something more substantial for this?
[43:08.18]Mario Maker 2.
[43:08.80]Very cool.
[43:24.18]No actual gameplay of what?
[43:29.34]Oh.
[43:31.60]Donkey Kong Country 4!
[43:32.82]Donkey Kong Country 4!
[43:33.50]Do it!
[43:37.26]Or like a tropical freeze.
[43:39.72]Do they have roommates now?
[43:55.55]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[44:10.04]It's gonna, it's gonna happen.
[44:12.54]Oh, you guys, it's fucking unbelievable.
[44:14.82]Oh, yeah.
[44:20.40]Wow.
[44:23.21]I didn't think this was gonna happen.
[44:24.41]I really didn't.
[44:26.29]I can't fucking believe it.
[44:27.55]I thought this was bullshit.
[44:36.19]Wow.
[44:38.54]They actually did it.
[44:51.29]I can't fucking believe it.
[45:22.61]Smash Brothers and Banjo-Kazooie.
[45:30.50]Wow.
[45:39.70]That obviously wasn't Duck Hunt's silhouette, was it?
[45:42.12]Explode!
[45:43.64]Stay tuned for more information about DLC in the future.
[45:48.37]As for Nintendo Switch, we have more games in development beyond what we've shown you today.
[45:53.29]I'm looking forward to the day we can introduce them to you.
[45:58.65]Not today.
[46:00.23]Speaking of, before we end this Direct, I actually have one more thing to show you.
[46:08.84]Come on.
[46:09.96]What do we got?
[46:14.35]It better be Metroid.
[46:15.29]Get off the screen!
[46:16.91]I still can't believe Banjo-Kazooie is in Smash Bros.
[47:03.20]I didn't play Breath of the Wild, did I just spoil everything?
[47:26.23]This I thought this was like DLC the sequel.
[47:29.38]It's not DLC.
[47:30.22]It's a sequel full-blown sequel.
[47:33.50]Oh Damn Alright That's it extra cool shit Dude, that's what the first one was missing would have been a 10 out of 10.
[47:46.94]That's awesome.
[47:48.04]Very cool Oh, yeah, yeah
[47:54.78]Is it?
[47:56.06]Do the joke.
[47:56.92]No, I can't, like, I can't recycle the same, like, I'm pretending to be on the podcast joke.
[48:02.43]I've done it, like, three times in three days.
[48:05.03]For each day there's been an E3, I've pretended to be on somebody else's show.
[48:10.40]I've... I'll tell you, I did... Banjo being in Smash means that, like, anything's possible now.
[48:20.86]They can put anybody in there now.
[48:23.23]I mean, Microsoft had to have had something to do with that, so who knows?
[48:28.01]Who knows who the hell you'll see there in a couple years.
[48:35.85]Sans.
[48:38.91]I don't know about that.
[48:40.17]I don't know about that.
[48:46.77]Do the joke.
[48:48.90]No, ugh.
[48:51.30]I just closed out the browser.
[48:53.16]It's not here anymore.
[48:57.64]Alright.
[48:58.98]So, hold on.
[49:00.92]It has been... Let me give you my total, my complete assessment here.
[49:05.18]Because this is now an assessment stream.
[49:21.19]Here we go.
[49:21.79]Okay, so.
[49:25.03]This is what I think about E3.
[49:29.23]AMD.
[49:30.54]With their lightning-fast processors.
[49:32.74]And their extremely affordable graphics processing units.
[49:42.10]I'll tell you one thing that I am disappointed on.
[49:44.06]And I'm disappointed with this every single year that is a Nintendo Direct for E3.
[49:48.07]Or anytime Nintendo does anything where they announce anything.
[49:52.70]No WarioWare.
[49:53.94]No, like, actual, real, new WarioWare.
[49:58.11]Every year, I'm just like... Are they gonna do it?
[50:01.37]And they just don't.
[50:03.87]So... They did that Game & Wario game for the Wii U, and it was stupid.
[50:09.78]It was, like, 16 games.
[50:12.06]It was just... Whatever.
[50:13.20]It wasn't really that good.
[50:13.96]It was pretty bad.
[50:17.20]It's been, like, 10 years since there's been, like, a real WarioWare.
[50:19.94]And those are my favorite fucking games that Nintendo's probably ever made.
[50:28.72]They did the one on the DS.
[50:31.42]WarioWare is dead.
[50:35.48]WarioWare Gold?
[50:36.44]No, but I mean like a console.
[50:41.84]WarioWare is shit?
[50:43.18]Oh, it is the shit.
[50:50.22]I want like a full-on WarioWare Switch.
[50:53.59]You know how much fun shit they could do with those two little controllers?
[50:57.37]They could have, like, you could have so many different things with the two.
[51:00.57]Just like they did with the Wii.
[51:04.41]And the screen, you could, they got a touch screen and they have motion controllers.
[51:10.99]Rhythm Heaven, that would be, yeah, anything like that would be good.
[51:16.13]Nobody buys them?
[51:16.93]I buy them.
[51:18.62]Isn't that enough?
[51:23.26]That should be enough.
[51:26.33]One guy, that's... Get one sale from me every time, Nintendo, that's a guarantee.
[51:36.58]Dude, if there was a collector's edition for Wario or Switch, and it was like, I don't know, like a Wario mask, and like, caffeine pills or something, like, I'd get it.
[51:54.41]he's drinking pac-man's brains he killed yeah like I fucking murdered pac-man and I turned him into a drink no this is this is a novelty device that came for fun um no no more heroes three uh looks at I don't know how it looks because we don't get to see it uh no more heroes three
[52:23.25]I was a big fan of the first two.
[52:25.25]I played the shit out of them in college.
[52:27.91]I'm sure it'll be alright.
[52:28.91]I'm sure it'll be good.
[52:32.51]What else was there?
[52:33.25]Watch Dogs 3.
[52:34.45]Lots of threes.
[52:35.19]Lots of threes that I think will be fun.
[52:38.19]Watch Dogs 3 is in this weird space where I think it'll be fun for like 12 hours and then I'll never play it ever again.
[52:44.85]Which, I don't know.
[52:51.57]The Minecraft, yeah, Diablo Minecraft.
[52:54.03]I will play that.
[52:56.07]Animal Crossing, I'll play that.
[52:58.89]Dragon Builders.
[53:01.42]I'll probably play that for, like, 40 minutes and then realize that it's way too complicated for me and that I've... I've got to go, like, file some, like, reports or something, like taxes, and I won't do it.
[53:12.59]Chivalry 2, I'm not... I'm not... I...
[53:20.67]I'm not excited for Chivalry 2.
[53:23.85]I just... It's not like I think it's not good.
[53:25.95]I just don't... It's not doing it for me.
[53:28.11]I feel like I played Mordhau.
[53:30.59]And... Chivalry 2 would have to be... Way better than Mordhau for me to care about it.
[53:41.33]Terraria.
[53:42.25]Yeah, I gotta play that.
[53:43.71]I've gotta play... I'm just... There's so many things to do.
[53:53.54]Elden Ring, yeah.
[53:54.92]It's hard to get excited about a game that is... Okay, remember when Sekiro got teased and it was just like a close-up of his prosthetic?
[54:02.79]It was just like... That's it.
[54:06.45]It's hard to be like, oh, I can't wait to play that.
[54:08.19]We didn't even know what it was.
[54:09.47]It was like, oh, I can't wait to play with that guy's bones.
[54:11.33]I thought it was a guy's bones.
[54:13.57]So it's hard to know what it's going to even be like.
[54:22.45]Yeah, it was a close-up of his prosthetic, and it was like crunching.
[54:25.19]I didn't even know it was a prosthetic.
[54:33.82]Did I download Roller Champions?
[54:35.98]I did not.
[54:39.12]Banjo- Alright, here's the thing about Banjo-Kazooie, that means... There's gonna be... Okay, I really hope this doesn't happen, but it's very possible.
[54:53.68]I mean, they might be like a Nintendo and Microsoft collaboration where they make Banjo-Kazooie 3.
[54:59.94]That's a great scenario.
[55:01.14]What a fucking awesome scenario.
[55:04.38]Potentially more likely is Microsoft rides this hype train from Smash Bros.
[55:11.13]and makes Nuts and Bolts 2.
[55:16.82]That's probably a real scenario.
[55:19.44]It's possible.
[55:20.74]There's an equal and opposite potential way to go here.
[55:26.99]Or we'll get like a Banjo-Kazooie mobile card game.
[55:31.67]Or a remastered Banjo-Kazooie 1 and 2.
[55:36.72]The ultimate scenario is that Microsoft decides to ride this train all the way up and makes Banjo-Kazooie 3.
[55:45.22]But I don't even hear people get so excited about Banjo-Kazooie 3.
[55:48.52]It's not even saying people anymore, right?
[55:50.06]It's like that studio has been... I mean, even if it was Banjo-Kazooie 3.
[55:57.24]It's like, oh, I wish there was a new game in the Chrono series.
[56:00.06]Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross.
[56:01.66]I can't wait for the next Chrono.
[56:02.70]None of the people are even still there.
[56:04.34]It would be different.
[56:05.24]It wouldn't be the same.
[56:07.28]And we essentially all locked ourselves in this, like, nostalgia box for, like, two decades.
[56:12.63]Just like, let me out, let me out, I can't wait to see you, I can't... And then finally you get to see it and it's like, some of these people don't even work here anymore.
[56:22.84]Because it's been, like, too long.
[56:25.02]That's the one problem.
[56:26.72]All these sequels and all these things that we, like, can't wait to see, it's been a very long time.
[56:31.18]So...
[56:33.54]It's like somebody writing a series of books, and then halfway through, somebody else comes in and finishes that person's story.
[56:42.69]It's like, alright, I guess it's the same characters, but... It can be tough, though, and a lot of people have trouble with it.
[57:01.78]Game of Thrones.
[57:07.38]Didn't want to say anything.
[57:12.53]That happened to Hitchhiker's Guide.
[57:15.67]It's actually happened quite a few times throughout history.
[57:22.79]Why do I look like a character from Greece?
[57:25.49]Because this is my E3 persona.
[57:31.03]What time is it?
[57:33.57]My phone's dead.
[57:38.17]What do I use in my hair?
[57:40.45]I use shampoo.
[57:43.12]And then I rinse it out.
[57:44.44]This is... My hair... Look it.
[57:45.74]Let me tell you something.
[57:47.64]My hair looks like this for like maybe two or three hours and then it just goes crazy.
[57:56.09]I use conditioner.
[57:57.49]Not every single day, but I do.
[58:06.52]I mean, I think that the banjo part of the name is pretty much enough, right?
[58:10.28]Just always thought of different kind of banjo one... What do you mean?
[58:14.88]I went by too fast.
[58:17.48]Am I graying?
[58:18.24]No.
[58:19.56]I probably will not have gray hair.
[58:21.62]Ever.
[58:23.08]I turned 33 this year.
[58:24.51]I mean, 35.
[58:24.87]That's a lie.
[58:25.71]I turned 34.
[58:26.53]I turned 34 this year and I'm... I got no gray.
[58:29.45]None.
[58:36.83]I'll be bald before it turns gray.
[58:38.21]Yeah, I'll be bald before it turns completely gray.
[58:41.51]There's plenty of time.
[58:42.63]There is a lot of time left.
[58:47.82]But anyway, so we got Nintendo.
[58:50.48]I mean, whatever they decide to do, hopefully somebody cares about it and we get something fun.
[58:56.40]Obviously, this is the one thing that...
[59:00.27]Alright, so Sakurai has his hands on Banjo, and he's making Banjo, and Banjo looks really, really great and really cool.
[59:11.16]But he might make it too good, and then Microsoft gets it, and they don't make it right.
[59:17.72]It's like Sonic Boom when Microsoft makes it.
[59:23.94]That's what you should be concerned with.
[59:34.69]That goes without saying.
[59:35.61]Yeah!
[59:37.51]Sakurai, seriously, like, he's so talented at making characters and making them the way that they, like, really should be, right?
[59:48.66]Every time a new character is introduced in Smash, you're like, oh my, holy shit, I can't wait to see this because it's gonna be so true and so awesome to what the source material was.
[59:58.98]There'll be little, like, Easter eggs with the moves and stuff.
[60:01.43]They do a great job.
[60:03.58]They do it better than the people that made the game did.
[60:09.64]Does Sakurai just make every game?
[60:13.33]We haven't figured out cloning yet?
[60:15.45]Just clone him a hundred times.
[60:17.95]And just have him make every single video game.
[60:20.11]It'll probably be good.
[60:30.63]He works himself to the bone.
[60:31.65]Yeah, he does.
[60:32.39]I mean...
[60:35.33]He really does.
[60:39.29]They have to, and do understand flavor when it comes to characters.
[60:42.01]The actual people who own the IP forget.
[60:46.35]Yeah, typically.
[60:47.45]I mean, well, think about it.
[60:48.35]If you have a character that's from franchises from 15 years ago, and nobody on your development staff has ever even worked with it before, and you make something else with that character, it's just like...
[61:00.81]Oh, I guess we do still have this character to work with.
[61:04.03]And then you give it to Sakurai and he makes it look easy.
[61:10.51]But, no, that's really cool to see that there's actual collaboration between... Because this shit, it gets so tiring.
[61:17.89]Everyone, like, in constant conflict with each other.
[61:22.65]Console wars.
[61:23.80]Get out of here, this is my exclusive, motherfucker!
[61:27.66]I'm supposed to be quiet.
[61:31.31]We got to see, for the first time in a long time, we got to see conflict resolved.
[61:36.90]We got Microsoft and Nintendo.
[61:40.08]No conflict.
[61:42.26]It's all I wanted.
[61:50.27]I didn't realize that Sony was streaming, like, right now.
[61:59.88]What is this?
[62:00.70]Click the link.
[62:05.43]Vermintide 2 is getting a versus mode.
[62:07.47]Rats, the rats, where the rats?
[62:12.29]What?
[62:13.61]Is that actually part of the article?
[62:18.71]That's fucking funny.
[62:22.76]The rats, the rats, where the rats?
[62:24.36]I mean, it could mean anything.
[62:30.13]That's versus well, though.
[62:31.63]That's pretty funny.
[62:32.83]That's pretty cool.
[62:35.27]Do I have any more info up here in my brain that I would like to get out?
[62:37.95]Yeah, probably.
[62:41.68]Square Enix... I'll be honest.
[62:44.44]I just don't get it.
[62:46.04]I just don't get... I'm not saying that I don't think those games are good.
[62:49.80]I just don't get it.
[62:50.52]I just don't get them.
[62:51.66]Like I told you last night.
[62:53.06]I was kind of sitting there not knowing what to do or say.
[62:56.13]Just because...
[62:58.59]I made the comment about it's like turning on a movie 45 minutes in and just being like, who the fuck are all these people?
[63:08.31]That's like, okay, that's like going like Lord of the Rings, right?
[63:12.63]Some of these games and some of these series are in like the 10th or 11th iteration.
[63:17.82]Oh, this is Dragon Quest XI!
[63:19.68]And I know they're different from story to story, but still, I mean, it's like... Some of these games are two or three iterations in.
[63:26.34]They have, like, books and novels and animes behind them.
[63:29.86]It's like walking in to a convention for one of these games, where people already are all really big fans, and they already know everything that's going on, and you're in, like, a Super Mario t-shirt.
[63:43.03]And you're like, I thought this was... This is not Super Mario?
[63:45.69]And they're like, what are you talking about?
[63:46.95]Oh, it's...
[63:48.67]But they would probably be happy.
[63:49.65]They'd be like, oh, I love Super Mario.
[63:50.97]But then you'd be like, I don't know who your character is.
[63:52.73]And I'd be like, I don't understand.
[63:59.05]It's hard to distinguish.
[64:00.24]Just because I don't really follow any of them.
[64:08.06]I look like a mob boss.
[64:09.90]No, I look like the mob boss's fucking sleazy accountant.
[64:15.95]I'm the guy that's like, yeah, man, what do you need?
[64:17.75]I can make that work for you.
[64:24.32]uh but that's not to say any of those franchises of games aren't any good it's just I I don't get them I don't understand it's like watching a three it's like watching a three-part trilogy movie in the last movie and not knowing any of the characters names but some of the things they did show were interesting uh but I don't really have much to say about it anyways uh what else we got we had Ubisoft
[64:53.28]I don't remember anything from Ubisoft.
[64:55.14]Not one thing.
[64:58.12]I remember the color of Todd's jacket.
[65:03.58]That's it.
[65:06.02]Oh, Watch Dogs 3.
[65:08.48]Right, okay.
[65:09.02]Alright, Watch Dogs 3.
[65:14.55]No, that was Bethesda.
[65:16.41]So, no, I'm like putting Bethesda into a different stage because there was Bethesda with a problem there.
[65:22.61]Okay, so not Ubisoft.
[65:25.30]Bethesda.
[65:30.06]I just know the color of Todd's jacket.
[65:31.34]That's why I was putting him in with Ubisoft.
[65:34.16]What color was the jacket?
[65:35.04]It was like a taupe.
[65:37.54]It was like a green beige.
[65:40.06]Did I get that wrong?
[65:46.25]Is it not that color?
[65:49.45]It was tan?
[65:51.42]It wasn't like a green olive?
[65:54.18]It wasn't an olive?
[66:01.71]Somebody give me a screenshot.
[66:02.71]Did I get that wrong?
[66:03.93]Was their conference that bad that I don't even know the color of Todd's jacket?
[66:08.05]That's the most important thing.
[66:12.23]What even was in Bethesda?
[66:15.68]Fallout 77.
[66:17.80]Fallout 76 is still a video game.
[66:20.14]Please, God, come play it.
[66:22.22]Was one.
[66:24.62]Doom!
[66:25.23]Oh yeah, Doom.
[66:29.81]There was Doom.
[66:30.47]Doom Eternal.
[66:31.67]Alright, that's cool.
[66:38.02]What else?
[66:38.72]Oh yeah, there was that Deathloop game.
[66:41.06]Let me see.
[66:44.63]Is this, did I get it wrong?
[66:46.23]I got it wrong.
[66:46.69]I'm not paying attention to what matters here.
[67:11.44]Why did I think it was like an olive color?
[67:14.44]Like a dark olive green, like, taupe.
[67:22.14]But, you know what?
[67:22.96]Having no Sony, just, it feels weird.
[67:25.86]It feels like, oh, I wish I could see some of that stuff.
[67:28.10]But, we don't, alright, this is, here's another potentially unpopular opinion.
[67:33.96]Follow these tonight.
[67:35.20]Today.
[67:35.56]It's 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock in the morning.
[67:37.56]Not tonight.
[67:38.52]My brain is just fried.
[67:40.43]Um,
[67:42.11]Do we really need an E3 every single year?
[67:48.43]Do we really need that?
[67:51.37]Not really, right?
[67:54.01]Why don't we have like a mini E3?
[67:57.80]Like E2.
[68:00.76]E3 could be like the big one when everyone has stuff to show.
[68:03.64]And E2 could be the Electronic Entertainment Expo.
[68:07.20]How about just like the Electronic Expo?
[68:13.41]Does it have to be E3?
[68:18.23]Yeah, look at some of these companies.
[68:19.89]Nintendo already does this.
[68:25.05]Sony decided this year that they weren't going to do this.
[68:28.04]Nintendo decided years ago that they weren't going to really do that anymore.
[68:34.84]It's not entertaining.
[68:37.02]No, they should just call it the EAE.
[68:43.72]The Electronic Ads Expo.
[68:46.66]Because I'll tell you, I really did feel like it.
[68:50.54]I really did feel like we just watched a bunch of YouTube pre-rolls on some of these conferences.
[69:03.39]EAE.
[69:08.75]It's called Growing Up.
[69:10.77]Wait, what?
[69:14.90]We need more gameplay demos.
[69:17.80]I just, I don't know.
[69:19.62]I think maybe I am getting old.
[69:24.48]It's always been that.
[69:25.08]But I feel like there's been more to talk about.
[69:28.78]But what I like, I like is how some of these indie games and indie companies are really starting to kind of flow up here and start to outshine some of these AAA games and companies.
[69:39.50]Doesn't everybody say that Devolver didn't even have a conference like three or four years ago?
[69:45.11]That's new.
[69:48.03]It's not like Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo.
[69:50.09]Devolver Digital.
[69:55.61]So it's interesting to see that there are some companies that are starting to actually come up here.
[70:01.05]AMD, yeah.
[70:06.91]They didn't have a car.
[70:07.59]No, but I mean like a presentation.
[70:10.09]They had a presentation.
[70:16.05]But maybe we just don't need an E3 every single year.
[70:19.04]Maybe stuff like the Nintendo Directs are the future.
[70:26.28]But I mean, next year, this won't be an E2 next year.
[70:30.42]It'll be an E3.
[70:33.48]They'll be... I would assume we'll get an announcement from Sony.
[70:37.58]There'll be consoles next year that they're showing.
[70:39.58]We'll get a full-on, completely just... The Microsoft Xbox... What is it called?
[70:48.04]What's the name of the thing?
[70:50.05]The Stellaris?
[70:50.75]The Xbox Stellaris?
[70:51.65]The Microsoft Stellaris?
[70:54.59]What is it called?
[70:57.11]The Scarlet.
[70:59.61]The Microsoft Scarlet.
[71:03.30]That'll be on a desk in the middle of the stage.
[71:06.40]It's going to be a little circle.
[71:07.66]It's going to be as big as an Amazon Echo.
[71:09.96]It'll be this big.
[71:12.84]A donut will be bigger than this thing.
[71:14.35]I'm just making a prediction here.
[71:16.61]A donut's going to be bigger than the scarlet.
[71:26.48]How is that going to run anything?
[71:28.32]It might be.
[71:28.76]I'm just telling you.
[71:29.52]It could be.
[71:32.25]It's going to be a little thing in the middle, and they're going to sell it like it's Cortana.
[71:38.64]Whatever the thing is called.
[71:39.40]The Halo.
[71:39.84]Halo.
[71:43.40]What's the Halo person?
[71:47.47]Bet on it.
[71:49.45]I'll buy it if you're right.
[71:51.41]Good.
[71:52.43]By the way, I love this.
[71:54.15]I love, like, the... They just... Nintendo just does with... Ugh.
[72:01.18]That transition is like, and now... You know how many times they probably recorded that snap to get that perfect?
[72:12.28]There was an audio engineer sitting in a room for potentially two to three straight weeks.
[72:19.47]Hiring different people to come like snap and like mixing it to get it perfect.
[72:25.35]Months even, yeah.
[72:30.17]That was the original snap of John Nintendo.
[72:36.71]Oh my god.
[72:40.65]He snapped at an investor meeting one time, and they picked it up through the phone.
[72:46.36]1948.
[72:46.38]1962.
[72:47.80]Yeah, that's not even actually a snap.
[72:49.14]Yeah.
[72:59.82]If it's a Foley artist, yeah, like somebody said, they probably, like, squished a bag of carrots and, like, mixed it together with, like, somebody dropping a book on the ground.
[73:12.18]To get that.
[73:12.64]And they pulled one out.
[73:13.46]Like, oh, get that little part right here where, like, the carrots squished.
[73:16.00]Right there.
[73:16.66]Just like... It's a Foley artist.
[73:20.51]A Foley artist, that's what they do.
[73:26.77]I don't think that's a human snap.
[73:28.07]It probably isn't.
[73:34.32]Audio editing is a ton of fun.
[73:35.38]It really is.
[73:36.40]Audio editing is like some of the most fun you'll ever have.
[73:40.51]What time is it?
[73:41.65]We don't have to go just yet, but I have to drive.
[73:44.21]Because Kim knew that I was getting up this early, she's like, oh, can you drive me here?
[73:48.81]And I'm like, yeah, I can drive you here.
[73:50.03]So I'm going to drive Kim somewhere.
[73:54.68]Because she knew I was going to be awake.
[73:59.66]Yeah, I'm not usually awake at 9 o'clock in the morning.
[74:08.51]I'm asleep in the chair.
[74:10.11]Can you imagine if I just fucking passed out?
[74:12.03]No, I drank coffee.
[74:13.45]Imagine if I just like fell asleep here like this and she like eventually comes in just like, are you fucking gonna drive me?
[74:19.07]I'm just like, yeah.
[74:30.64]9 a.m.
[74:30.86]for Germany is 5 a.m.
[74:32.16]for the rest of us.
[74:36.78]Please.
[74:40.35]You trying to tell me that most of you fucking guys wake up at 5 a.m.?
[74:45.47]No.
[74:47.65]Some of you do.
[74:51.65]No, I don't believe that at all.
[74:55.18]Yeah, well, most of us get up at 5.
[74:57.42]No, most of you get up at like 11, 10.
[75:01.66]You know why?
[75:02.94]Some of you, especially during the summertime.
[75:05.10]You know, I've got demographics on my Twitch analytics page.
[75:10.44]I know, I know exactly how old most of you guys are.
[75:15.11]I know how old you are.
[75:15.85]And that's it.
[75:21.45]So, I mean, college age is what a lot of you guys are.
[75:26.56]You guys are in college.
[75:28.74]When I was in college, I didn't get up till fucking like 6 p.m.
[75:35.64]So, oh yeah, we get up at 5 every day.
[75:41.08]Eh, sorry.
[75:42.88]The data says otherwise.
[75:44.31]How do I know how old you are?
[75:51.53]I have morning classes.
[75:53.21]Not right now.
[75:55.36]What time?
[75:55.66]Are you in high school or college right now?
[76:01.92]You're out.
[76:05.52]You're out of school.
[76:07.32]You got up at like fucking 8 o'clock this afternoon.
[76:09.62]I use it as afternoon.
[76:12.49]Oh, you got up this afternoon at 8 o'clock.
[76:14.81]That's how you can tell I fucking stay up really late.
[76:18.11]8 p.m.
[76:18.51]is like in the middle of the afternoon.
[76:27.10]I stayed up all night.
[76:28.36]I was thinking about doing that because I didn't want to miss this because I really did not want to tell everybody that I was going to be here at 9 o'clock in the morning and just not show up.
[76:35.87]So I was like, fuck, I really don't want to sleep through an alarm or something.
[76:38.53]Should I just stay up the whole time and then come and sit down here?
[76:42.83]I thought about it.
[76:43.79]No, I slept.
[76:44.85]I did.
[76:47.30]I would have been delirious.
[76:58.12]I didn't?
[76:58.62]Well, why didn't you?
[76:59.26]You should have gone to bed.
[77:11.34]You don't want to see that.
[77:14.04]Oh, you should do that.
[77:14.90]I've done that before, and I just... Okay, do you remember the first 15 to 20 minutes of this stream?
[77:23.65]Go watch it.
[77:25.37]That was an hour and 20 minutes ago.
[77:26.83]But do you remember?
[77:27.73]Go watch that.
[77:28.90]I was sitting here just turning the stream on, just barely had woken up.
[77:31.86]And I'm just like, I was weird.
[77:35.34]I was a weirdo.
[77:37.40]I couldn't really make any references.
[77:39.58]My brain was just like starting to turn on.
[77:41.84]Okay, here's my operating system.
[77:43.52]Let me give you a good example here.
[77:45.90]I have a really, really, really good computer up here.
[77:49.24]It works.
[77:50.38]I mean, maybe I might be kind of full.
[77:52.74]My hard drive might be failing a little.
[77:55.16]But it's still really good.
[77:56.08]It still works just fine.
[77:57.24]And the graphics card works.
[77:58.71]Everything works.
[78:00.03]But I have like a 7 to 10 minute boot up sequence.
[78:03.85]Like if you turned your computer on, it took like 15 minutes to turn on.
[78:07.45]But once it's on, it goes.
[78:11.45]So I can't get an SSD.
[78:13.35]I have a hard drive up here.
[78:14.49]I have a, I can't, what am I going to take my brain out?
[78:20.46]Now some of you guys, some of you guys were born with an SSD in your head and that's good.
[78:25.16]That's great.
[78:25.60]You can get up in the morning and bang, you're ready to go.
[78:28.16]Some of you guys can, it also takes me like 20 minutes to like boot the computer down.
[78:34.10]It takes... I have so many viruses.
[78:36.48]You know when somebody has like a shitload of viruses?
[78:38.91]And it takes like 20 minutes for the computer to turn off and turn on?
[78:43.69]I'm like your grandfather's computer.
[78:46.83]I have a bunch of viruses in my operating system that I can't get rid of.
[78:53.37]Too much bloatware.
[78:58.76]But...
[79:00.95]I've got too many toolbars.
[79:01.91]I've got too many tabs open, too.
[79:03.23]That's another thing.
[79:05.02]I have, like, a hundred Firefox tabs open with an operating system from fucking Windows Vista.
[79:16.00]What the fuck?
[79:19.27]Still using Internet Explorer.
[79:22.43]But it takes me a long time to boot up.
[79:24.67]A very long... I still am not boot... completely boot up.
[79:27.91]So that's why when you watch the stream for the first 20 minutes...
[79:31.63]I am fucking useless.
[79:34.25]Absolutely useless.
[79:35.67]I better not ever in my whole life ever have a job where I gotta get up in the morning and be ready to pull the lever.
[79:43.38]You know what I mean?
[79:45.30]I'll miss it by a nanosecond.
[79:46.94]You know what I mean?
[79:48.28]I can't have that.
[79:50.27]Alright, here's your job.
[79:51.35]Your job is to get in here at exactly 6 a.m.
[79:53.46]You sit right here, and you wake up at 5.30 in the morning.
[79:56.62]You got to get here, and you sit.
[79:57.92]All your job is just to pull the lever at 5.10 exactly.
[80:01.94]I'll miss it.
[80:05.17]That's the whole, that's all I have to do.
[80:06.25]I don't have to do anything.
[80:07.91]I'm the person that turns on the factory.
[80:09.73]You know what I mean?
[80:10.43]I just have to, like, turn it on and catch it when it's going to its next, like, the transmission.
[80:15.25]Like, it's going to, like, into drive.
[80:16.45]I have to, like, catch it.
[80:17.07]That's how you turn on every factory.
[80:20.10]I just gotta pull that lever.
[80:22.28]That's it.
[80:22.68]I wouldn't be able to do it.
[80:25.55]I would, like, fucking pass out at, like, 5.08.
[80:28.89]And at 5.10, when it's supposed to be pulled, I would, like, snap out of it and pull it at, like, 5.11.
[80:33.05]And, like, the factory would turn off.
[80:35.92]And, like, it would be $600 million in damages to that place.
[80:40.66]What SCP are you talking about?
[80:47.38]What SCP am I to have to contain?
[80:51.13]I gotta catch it at the right second.
[80:52.69]I'm the guy.
[80:53.65]I'm the guy in that factory that is like catching the SCP.
[80:56.89]I have to do everything in tandem.
[80:59.11]I'm the guy that lets him out.
[81:00.81]You play all those games.
[81:02.33]Holy shit, I can't believe SCP-666 got out of his containment facility.
[81:07.96]It's because Jerma-985 woke up too late and like got in there and fell asleep at his desk.
[81:13.72]I'm that person that has that happen.
[81:19.93]But anyways, what else was there?
[81:21.09]Microsoft.
[81:21.59]SCP isn't a game.
[81:28.82]No, I know.
[81:29.28]I'm just saying, like, the game that you've played based on your favorite... certain... service certain protocol monster.
[81:43.71]I don't know.
[81:43.97]Whatever the hell.
[81:44.33]What is it called?
[81:46.19]What does SCP stand for?
[81:55.74]Secure, contain, protect.
[81:57.26]What did I say?
[82:01.82]Secure socket?
[82:04.90]SSL?
[82:05.97]Secure socket encryption.
[82:12.33]Grow a beard?
[82:12.81]I can't.
[82:13.27]It's not possible.
[82:13.95]It just looks like shit.
[82:14.93]It already does.
[82:15.91]This is where it starts and then it looks horrible in like 12 hours.
[82:27.30]Service Certain Protocol.
[82:29.42]That was close.
[82:34.55]But anyways, Microsoft... Games as a service is going to be a reality sooner than you think.
[82:46.81]That's pretty much what you need to know from that, is that games as a service is happening sooner than you probably think.
[82:57.13]senior citizen pee pants I'm so glad that pee pants is gonna be a thing on this channel it's been a thing between friends me and my friends especially burger boy for like a decade more than that almost no no when did smite come out 2012 2013. since smite like released and was able to go into like private rooms it's been a thing that we call each other
[83:31.38]Jerma cries.
[83:32.14]When did I cry?
[83:35.06]I love this mug.
[83:35.72]You can get it on Amazon.
[83:38.76]Just type this in and then put mug after it.
[83:43.99]You'll find a couple of them.
[83:50.59]Why am I drinking this like I'm drinking a goblet?
[83:54.27]Why am I holding it like this?
[83:58.74]You're breathtaking.
[83:59.58]You're breathtaking!
[84:00.56]That's it, right?
[84:09.26]Can I tell you that I feel bad about that?
[84:11.20]Because that is the meme of the 2019 E3 conferences.
[84:17.50]That's the meme.
[84:18.70]That's the thing that everyone is so glad that they got to see.
[84:23.52]And I covered it up.
[84:25.42]I actually was covering that when it was happening.
[84:34.56]So, if you watched my version of E3, you didn't get to see the, like, your breathtaking, like, the live meme.
[84:43.31]I've ruined it.
[84:44.31]I covered it.
[84:45.01]I, like, literally covered him up.
[84:48.31]And Twitch highlighted it, yeah.
[84:53.98]Twitch tweeted it.
[84:55.62]Yeah.
[84:58.10]Eh, whatever.
[84:59.62]Maybe we'll get some new friends.
[85:07.21]link it it's if you just go to official twitch.tv Twitter scroll down will you find it the guy who said that is getting a free copy of cyberpunk collector's edition what do you mean the guy who said what the guy who's but what the guy
[85:36.72]Oh, the breathtaking guy.
[85:39.16]Oh, well, when we talk about guy, there's a lot of one guys on this channel.
[85:49.56]When I see, like, oh, the guy, I'm thinking of what one guy?
[85:52.64]Where?
[85:55.56]It is a real-life one guy scenario.
[86:01.15]The guy.
[86:02.65]Which one guy?
[86:03.63]There's...
[86:06.84]One guy is getting cyberpunk.
[86:08.26]That's... That's fun.
[86:11.19]That's fun.
[86:13.41]I'm glad people can have a good time.
[86:19.11]Keanu Reeves.
[86:20.51]They're giving it to Keanu Reeves.
[86:23.28]They loved that segment so much that Keanu Reeves is getting a collector's edition.
[86:34.32]But I got a skedaddle here in a few minutes.
[86:37.66]So who won?
[86:38.70]Okay, yeah, I got that up there.
[86:39.94]Who won E3?
[86:44.60]All of us.
[86:45.00]Because we get to experience... Probably Nintendo.
[87:04.36]um micro okay Microsoft won in like a by the stock sense because of the new console right so Microsoft won okay if there's two if there's like people that like video games and then like businessmen in suits that trade stocks back and forth Microsoft won to these guys and probably I
[87:33.34]I mean, Nintendo just had stuff that I... Nintendo had the most stuff that I was like, ooh!
[87:38.36]Ooh!
[87:40.38]That didn't happen that many other times.
[87:42.76]So just judging by my ooh and ah meter, I would have to say it was probably Nintendo.
[87:51.69]Watch Dogs 3 looks really, really fun, but the ooh and ah meter was higher, I- I think, for stuff that Nintendo showed.
[88:01.55]And it was not that long either.
[88:03.93]Who had the most disappointing conference?
[88:07.01]I think the whole thing was just kind of... Disappointing is not really the right word, but... Nothing really was grabbing me.
[88:17.64]But yeah, Bethesda.
[88:19.10]Bethesda spent the first 30 or 40 minutes talking about how...
[88:26.94]How much they love the community and Fallout 76.
[88:32.84]Hey, we're like, don't you like us?
[88:35.31]We like you.
[88:36.59]Fallout 76, we like you.
[88:38.91]Have you heard about this game, Fallout 76?
[88:40.55]We really like you.
[88:45.01]They've had so many missteps.
[88:52.15]They realized everyone started hating them.
[88:57.31]yeah let's just hope that they kind of turn it around here it looks like it looks like they're trying it does with some of these things doom is really the thing that's like doom has doom is like a a canoe right and like like they just sit the the the creator of doom eternal is like sitting in a canoe and he has like six thousand pounds in that canoe
[89:28.42]And he has to fucking like row it across an ocean.
[89:33.06]Worst analogy, what?
[89:39.14]How is that not true?
[89:45.41]They got like a fucking boat full of like stuff that people don't think is cool.
[89:50.53]And then they've got Doom, which people think is awesome.
[89:55.31]That's a bet.
[89:55.81]I'm going to veto that.
[89:57.19]That's the best analogy of 2019.
[89:58.23]I veto everyone in the chat.
[90:04.67]Sorry.
[90:06.77]Vroom Eternal.
[90:08.09]I think Just Dance will probably be... I just realized Just Dance is Madden.
[90:22.43]It's new Madden.
[90:25.12]Damn.
[90:25.58]Okay.
[90:29.88]What else was there?
[90:30.44]I think that's it.
[90:37.69]What am I going to do?
[90:38.15]A Jess Dance stream?
[90:39.79]I would do a Jess Dance stream.
[90:42.65]No, I wouldn't.
[90:43.15]I'm not even going to say this number because it's way too high.
[90:45.11]And I don't know.
[90:47.27]Somebody might just like fucking find a way.
[90:49.46]So I'm not going to say it.
[90:54.40]I never underestimate people in this community.
[90:59.33]I won't.
[90:59.75]I don't do that.
[91:05.29]Dermot lied about Just Dance.
[91:06.53]Dermot didn't even make a statement about Just Dance.
[91:08.50]He just said it was Madden.
[91:10.54]It's new Madden.
[91:15.00]But I think that's...
[91:17.48]worsted out I just said a guy was in a boat carrying other like he was throwing his anchor filled boat which was bethesda that's not an analogy that's an analogy I said a guy was in a boat and all of a sudden that's the worst analogy I've ever heard an anchor filled boat I talked about like reincarnating into Harry Potter today and apparently that that was better
[91:52.87]Boats.
[91:55.87]Alright, well... Yeah.
[92:00.95]I think that's it.
[92:02.31]That's E3.
[92:02.61]The last three days have been fun to hang out with everybody.
[92:07.31]Hopefully you had a good time.
[92:12.39]I've got to go take Kim.
[92:13.37]I've got to drive Kim.
[92:15.62]And... Yeah, I'll see you guys... I'll see you guys for this stuff.
[92:22.92]The next stream that you see on this channel is going to be... We're going to have fun.
[92:27.42]Friday night, we're going to do an unlock.
[92:29.14]Going to have some wine, probably.
[92:34.86]No, I'll do the bits.
[92:35.70]I've still got time for that.
[92:36.84]I want to make sure I had enough time to do it, so... What is that?
[92:43.50]Well... You're going to have to just see.
[92:47.00]You're going to have to come on Friday night.
[92:48.52]You're going to have to come to the stream.
[92:52.19]Find out what that is?
[92:55.81]Five Nights at Freddy's... What's... I... Okay, somebody explain this.
[93:01.47]Is this Five Nights at Freddy's VR spam thing?
[93:04.77]Is this like a... Do I have to go look this up on Memepedia later?
[93:08.41]What is this?
[93:13.69]Is this like pull the lever?
[93:16.06]Is this like a thing I have to look up?
[93:18.22]I know it's a real game, but is there like a... Is there something I'm missing here?
[93:26.86]It's a game.
[93:27.34]Alright, so do you just want me to play this game?
[93:31.08]Well, if you have a recommendation for a video game, put it in the recommendation channel in the Discord.
[93:41.91]I mean, it's VR.
[93:43.25]We have to wait for another VR night.
[93:48.95]He doesn't check.
[93:49.53]I checked the recommendations like two days ago.
[93:51.63]What are you guys trying to tell me?
[93:59.67]We'll get... Oh, he's getting salty.
[94:01.19]He's getting salty.
[94:02.23]Here comes... No, I'm getting peppery.
[94:05.40]Salty implies that, like, I'm irritated.
[94:07.74]Peppery is like... I'm just like... It's like the nasal passages.
[94:10.66]I'm getting a little peppered up.
[94:16.52]I'm not salty.
[94:17.34]I'm fucking, like, Cayenne.
[94:20.78]It hits... What?
[94:23.58]What?
[94:28.12]How about triggered?
[94:29.08]No.
[94:31.76]Dude, I don't really don't care about Five Nights at Freddy's.
[94:35.19]This is not like making me angry.
[94:38.63]I can't believe they're saying Five Nights at Freddy's VR.
[94:40.65]I fucking... I hate it.
[94:42.79]That's fine.
[94:45.11]I'll play it.
[94:49.19]When we do, he's turning red.
[94:50.55]No, I'm turning red because I'm sweaty.
[94:59.69]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[95:08.22]Once people talk about how, like, sweaty I look, that's when I have to turn the camera off.
[95:15.82]Go check out, uh, the Nintendo Treehouse, right?
[95:18.13]That's going on right now.
[95:19.43]If you want to see more of that stuff.
[95:21.79]Uh, this stream was not going to be very long.
[95:23.09]Just want to do the Nintendo Direct and sit for, like, 20-30 minutes and talk about E3.
[95:29.57]Thank you, as always, for watching.
[95:31.22]If you got up early for this, hopefully you saw something you liked.
[95:35.28]And we'll go through the bits here.
[95:36.54]There's not very many.
[95:37.22]It'll take very, very quickly.
[95:40.06]See you Friday night for Unlock Wine Drinking Stream.
[95:48.91]I'm looking forward to it.
[95:52.81]Anywho.
[95:55.55]What do you say we get two back here?
[95:59.29]a couple hours ago.
[96:01.41]We had $3, 300 bits from Niall Orian.
[96:06.06]Do you do villain hair every year as a meme or what?
[96:09.68]No, I do villain hair every year because
[96:13.50]I have to be here when the conferences go live.
[96:17.68]I can't turn my stream on like 10, 20 minutes later so my hair doesn't dry.
[96:22.84]So I can't be late to E3 streams.
[96:26.08]So I get out of the shower and just get the fuck in here.
[96:30.08]I can't be late to these.
[96:36.36]Guys, every time I'm late to the stream, I'm just waiting for my hair to dry so I look alright.
[96:42.73]Regardless if I turn the webcam on, ever.
[96:45.98]I have to, like, look good.
[96:49.24]Villain shower.
[96:50.70]But, no.
[96:51.60]Yeah.
[96:52.28]Yes.
[96:55.44]I don't use a hair dryer?
[96:56.50]I don't have time for a hair dryer.
[97:02.31]But, plus, it's kind of like a thing now.
[97:06.11]Bathrobe and showered hair is just kind of the way it is.
[97:09.65]It's what I'm going to do every year.
[97:11.88]If I go to E3 next year, I'm going to have that haircut, that hairstyle.
[97:19.91]I'm just going to be in a bathrobe, too.
[97:22.29]Is that allowed?
[97:22.81]If I have clothes on, it is, right?
[97:28.56]Maybe.
[97:31.64]But yeah.
[97:32.54]Thank you, Niall Orion.
[97:34.54]I do not look like Travis Touchdown.
[97:35.78]No.
[97:35.84]I don't.
[97:36.12]Thank you for the $5, though.
[97:37.64]Really appreciate it.
[97:38.16]I do?
[97:38.28]No, I don't.
[98:07.08]Hey, Niall Aureon, again!
[98:08.34]Niall Aureon.
[98:11.00]Thanks for the three dollars.
[98:13.44]Yeah, the MC from Persona 5, Banjo and Kazooie are gonna be in the next Smash.
[98:17.52]Things I never would have expected a year ago.
[98:21.35]No?
[98:22.63]I-I-I-Sma- There was a lot of rumors going around that Banjo- Oh, Banjo's in the game!
[98:28.41]Remember, like, two years ago, a year ago, whatever?
[98:30.77]It was like, oh.
[98:35.82]Bullshit.
[98:36.50]And then it got debunked, and then it got debunked again, and everyone kind of lost hope.
[98:44.67]That's really, really cool.
[98:45.73]It's exciting to see that.
[98:49.85]But... Yes, that is true.
[98:51.99]I never would have thought the same thing.
[98:54.35]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $2.50.
[98:57.73]Mr. Butt Woman, thanks for the $10.
[98:59.71]Here's a better analogy for Doom.
[99:03.40]Doom.
[99:06.60]Is a bird... picking up somebody?
[99:15.81]No, the analogy is... Doom is sitting in a boat, and he's rowing across a huge ocean.
[99:27.04]And he has like 500 Fallout 76 game discs in his boat.
[99:32.14]I just made it better.
[99:35.05]That's so much better, okay?
[99:37.01]Can I, like, retract that and change the joke?
[99:41.03]He has, like, 400... He has, like, 200,000 Fallout 76 game discs.
[99:47.16]That's better.
[99:47.66]That's funny.
[99:58.14]Okay, let's see.
[99:59.66]One person said it was funny.
[100:02.18]Thank you, Mr. Buttwoman, for the $10...
[100:12.10]Fallout 76 isn't on disk.
[100:13.90]Yes, it is.
[100:14.28]I remember being in Best Buy and it being on the shelf.
[100:16.96]And very, very specifically, there was a big display for it.
[100:20.80]And there were a ton of sealed packages.
[100:23.48]And it was a perfect new Jenga.
[100:27.54]It had not even been touched.
[100:29.38]Right next to it was Red Dead Redemption 2, and that shit was empty.
[100:36.93]There were two discs, like little disk boxes things, to bring up to the front.
[100:48.09]So... Put them in the boat.
[100:52.84]They're just empty boxes.
[100:54.22]Yeah, but they... They personify a disk.
[100:58.74]They're in a case, and they're on a display.
[101:08.17]Cardboard discs with codes.
[101:12.35]Yeah, there ain't gonna be any more discs anymore, guys.
[101:15.73]It's not gonna happen.
[101:16.79]We're gonna go completely onto a disk.
[101:23.01]No, I mean like a solid state drive.
[101:26.23]Like a hard disk.
[101:27.13]You know what I'm saying?
[101:33.32]Like an HDD.
[101:35.04]SD.
[101:37.86]Guys, we're moving from disk to disk.
[101:43.50]The cloud.
[101:45.27]I don't think we're ready for the cloud yet.
[101:47.09]Computers aren't fast enough.
[101:48.55]The internet's not, like, good enough for cloud computing to really be worth using yet.
[101:52.70]Maybe like another five to ten years.
[101:54.18]Maybe.
[101:54.42]I don't think it's there.
[102:04.67]Do you remember when Microsoft made it a huge deal that they were going to do cloud computing for Crackdown 3?
[102:11.84]And that never happened because they probably got halfway through development and realized that it was not possible.
[102:15.84]Do you remember that?
[102:20.95]Crackdown 3, the buildings are all going to be cloud computing.
[102:25.79]You don't even need the processing.
[102:27.21]Oh, that didn't happen.
[102:28.01]We got Crackdown 1 reskinned.
[102:40.36]They probably had ambitious plans for that, but they did.
[102:44.50]And it just wasn't there yet, probably.
[102:51.72]I think in another five to ten years, there will be no more consoles.
[102:55.10]There will be like the Microsoft login.
[102:59.22]And that's it.
[103:00.10]You log into Microsoft, and everything's just there.
[103:04.04]And you might have a little box, a little small Amazon Echo box, that plugs into your TV.
[103:13.17]There's not gonna... I don't think there'll be... There's gonna be total packages.
[103:19.76]It's gonna happen.
[103:23.38]Listen to me, guys.
[103:26.42]I... I predicted the video game Olympics.
[103:29.07]And people said I was wrong.
[103:31.27]I'll be wrong again in 2019.
[103:32.65]I'll be correct in 2025.
[103:43.84]Nobody else predicted that.
[103:44.64]That was me.
[103:49.18]Somebody will write up... And look, it's written in stone.
[103:55.51]20 years from now... I'll be... My picture will be, like, on the fucking... $100 bill of video gaming history.
[104:05.17]They'll be having... I'll be one of those, like, old commentators that they... Oh, and remember, we... Interestingly enough... Back in 2012...
[104:15.18]one of our most celebrated video game commentators to ever live.
[104:21.76]Jerma985 gave us a little tidbit, and people thought it wasn't real back then, and I'll get like a whole celebrated piece.
[104:37.82]Egomaniac, humble streamer.
[104:48.62]ego maniac imagine really thinking and like hoping that somebody like writes a book about something you said in like a TF2 gameplay commentary there has to be people that'll like that right I mean you
[105:12.31]Alright, let's move on.
[105:12.93]Um... I don't know.
[105:13.89]Favorite game... My absolute favorite one.
[105:35.08]Yeah, it's really easy to say Elden Ring, but I feel like that's such an easy answer that there's got to be another one that I would say instead.
[105:46.13]No more Heroes 3, probably.
[105:52.21]I really, really loved those games.
[105:53.99]I thought they were so much fun.
[105:55.73]No gameplay, but it's a thing and it's real, so...
[106:04.33]What did I like about Elden Ring?
[106:05.69]It's just another FromSoftware game and George R.R.
[106:07.66]Martin is helping to make the world.
[106:09.18]That's enough for me to be like, that's a... I love that.
[106:13.26]But... That's why I said it's such an easy answer.
[106:22.49]I don't know if a game can essentially even win this year.
[106:27.20]You know what game probably won this year's E3?
[106:29.94]Doom Eternal, because it's one of the only video games that showed more than one minute of gameplay.
[106:38.96]If you're just going by that.
[106:47.96]So, if you want, that probably is what won the whole E3.
[106:52.84]But, by that logic, Star Wars is in the top five.
[106:59.16]Because it was one of the only ones to show anything.
[107:05.74]I like to keep my expectations very low.
[107:08.20]Just because of all the... I mean, we've seen the videos of... Hey, watchdogs!
[107:13.36]Let's go through, like, five filters after release of what the game actually is.
[107:19.04]So... I'm looking... Let's put it this way.
[107:22.06]I'm not excited for it, but I'm looking forward to... No More Heroes 3.
[107:28.42]Elden Ring.
[107:33.53]And I gotta get a third one.
[107:35.96]Come on, I gotta get a third one.
[107:38.46]Cyberpunk is really easy to say too, but no.
[107:41.02]What's a third one that I really, really cared about?
[107:45.10]Breath of the Wild?
[107:45.76]No, I didn't play the first one.
[107:46.92]I didn't play Breath of the Wild.
[107:48.71]Minecraft Diablo?
[107:50.61]Is that it?
[107:52.23]Might be.
[107:57.37]It really might be.
[108:00.14]Oh, Fall Guys.
[108:01.22]Yep, that's another one.
[108:02.33]Yeah.
[108:03.77]That looks like it's gonna be a ton of fun.
[108:06.91]Or that Heroes of Might and Magic.
[108:08.93]I forgot about it.
[108:09.49]I watched those trailers yesterday.
[108:14.78]I'm not really excited for Meat Fortress.
[108:16.58]I think it's cool and I'll definitely do it.
[108:18.88]But that's not like a video game to be excited about.
[108:22.56]That's like a cool tech display that's gonna be in another game.
[108:33.34]There they go.
[108:33.78]Those are probably the three.
[108:34.42]Or four.
[108:38.12]Pretty cool.
[108:40.64]Let's get the credits on screen.
[108:42.20]This is probably going to be... This is probably going to be fairly quick here.
[108:48.97]Actually, it's going to be really slow, isn't it?
[108:51.53]Watch this.
[108:54.45]This is going to be weird.
[108:55.81]Watch, ready?
[108:57.99]The faster it is, the more people have subscribed.
[109:05.77]Thanks for supporting the stream.
[109:12.35]Less than a couple hours, but... Still, thank you guys.
[109:18.64]All of you.
[109:20.58]VR Friday?
[109:21.74]No.
[109:22.30]We're doing Unlock Friday.
[109:26.80]Read them.
[109:27.32]Read them.
[109:27.74]I can't.
[109:28.22]I can't read them.
[109:28.72]You know why I can't read them?
[109:30.75]Because I don't read anybody else's.
[109:33.07]And, like, this is... If I read these, then that's...
[109:36.97]That's not fair.
[109:41.74]If I read these, then like, it's not fair for people that I don't read.
[109:45.52]Read one.
[109:46.12]Okay.
[109:46.52]I'll pick out one.
[109:52.48]Who's it gonna be?
[109:56.26]Who am I gonna read?
[109:56.98]Fro- No?
[110:03.61]Grill?
[110:05.97]No.
[110:22.29]Thank you so much, Phil25, for your subscription, Phil25.
[110:45.68]Alright, right now, this person's like... The notifications are going crazy.
[110:50.72]That person probably thinks there's an earthquake.
[110:53.10]Or like a meteor is hitting Earth.
[110:55.20]What's happening?
[110:56.40]What's happening?
[110:56.98]There's a meteor.
[111:01.56]They're not here.
[111:02.04]Well, whatever.
[111:06.63]Anywho.
[111:07.43]There's only a couple more.
[111:08.65]We got CluelessSniper250.
[111:09.59]Thank you for the 250.
[111:12.55]Thanks for getting up early to stream.
[111:14.25]I think we got that already, but...
[111:17.32]Yeah, that was a favorite game, right.
[111:19.82]Hopefully I gave you the ones that I remembered.
[111:22.62]It's been a lot, so... Lucas, thank you Lucas for the five dollars.
[111:28.01]What do you think of the Valve Index?
[111:30.17]Did you get one?
[111:31.81]No, I have a Vive.
[111:35.07]I bought a Vive like two months before all these cool new devices were announced.
[111:42.77]So I have the original Vive.
[111:45.33]I'm not gonna be getting the Index.
[111:50.96]The Vive works just fine.
[111:53.96]So, I probably won't be getting the Index either at all or immediately.
[111:58.02]Maybe I'll upgrade some of the pieces.
[111:59.14]I want the controllers.
[112:01.76]So, I'll definitely get the controllers.
[112:06.17]Because I like the Vive controllers aren't uncomfortable, but sometimes I really do feel like I'm an air traffic controller with these big cones in my hands.
[112:14.51]So, I will definitely get the new knuckle controllers.
[112:23.79]At least.
[112:27.33]But thank you, Lucas, for the $5.
[112:30.56]And finally, Niall Oregon, thanks for the $3.
[112:33.08]You can't tell me this isn't you.
[112:39.30]No, it's not.
[112:40.44]It isn't.
[112:41.92]Look.
[112:49.25]This is not me.
[112:55.01]Do you see a scar on my face?
[112:58.67]It doesn't look anything like me.
[112:59.64]I don't have a scar there.
[113:05.50]Not yet?
[113:06.10]What?
[113:10.28]What do you mean, not yet?
[113:16.47]Jesus.
[113:20.23]Compare.
[113:21.05]I can't compare it right now.
[113:24.97]I don't look anything like this right now.
[113:46.93]No, I've got more fatty deposits on my face.
[113:55.70]Yeah, I've got like fatty cheek deposits up here.
[113:57.96]He doesn't have that.
[114:00.59]Imagine if I turned this on and I made it like a big makeup scar right here.
[114:06.00]Too bad.
[114:15.17]Alright, guys.
[114:16.04]Happy E3.
[114:18.06]And, by the way, I've got a skedaddle, but... Today, I didn't even really even think about this.
[114:24.66]Today is my 8th year on the Internet.
[114:28.83]Starting on YouTube anniversary.
[114:30.67]I didn't even know that.
[114:31.25]This is my I'm on the Internet 8 years.
[114:36.05]And somebody made a video.
[114:39.62]It's like a 40 minute long video.
[114:43.74]I wish I could watch it, but I can't at the moment.
[114:46.26]I've got to get out of here.
[114:47.46]I've got to go.
[114:51.93]I did it.
[114:52.25]It was me.
[114:53.87]Awesome, Triss.
[114:54.37]Thank you for that video.
[114:56.23]And... Yeah, that's eight years.
[115:01.37]I don't really have much to say.
[115:05.01]Besides, it's still fun.
[115:07.77]And I lose interest in things very quickly.
[115:09.81]And I have not lost interest in this.
[115:12.68]So, I can't believe that it's been eight years and it's been climbing up almost a decade.
[115:17.77]It's still just as fun as it was eight fucking years ago.
[115:25.97]So, thank you for joining me.
[115:29.06]Thanks for all you guys do every year, every day, every month, every week.
[115:36.13]And I will see you guys on Friday.
[115:38.31]We're going to do the unlock webcam wine stream.
[115:44.99]If it's not what I expect and it's not that fun, then we're just going to... You know, we just look like we do every time.
[115:52.92]We're just going to make our own fun.
[115:55.92]See you guys on Friday.
[115:58.06]Have a great next couple of days.
[116:00.42]Happy E3.
[116:01.50]Enjoy the rest of it.
[116:03.24]Take care.
[116:04.52]And goodbye.
