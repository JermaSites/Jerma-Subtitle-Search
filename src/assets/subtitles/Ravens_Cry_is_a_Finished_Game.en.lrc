[00:03.28]This guy looks like he's waiting for a bus.
[00:13.22]Get out of my way.
[00:14.63]Yeah, fuck you.
[00:17.85]It's the same person talking.
[00:21.49]I didn't even do that.
[00:22.31]I didn't even do that.
[00:23.15]Why?
[00:23.61]I did not press any button to hit him.
[00:25.31]He just hit him.
[00:27.47]Uh-oh.
[00:28.42]There's pirates here waiting for me.
[00:32.67]And there's no, none of you, none of you, you let me have the flag and here you stand.
[00:37.11]Mind telling me how that's possible?
[00:39.25]My name is Christopher Raven.
[00:40.47]Yeah, my name is Batman.
[00:41.97]That's more, that drunken asshole.
[00:43.97]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:51.88]So what's next?
[00:55.16]Be brave, motherfuckers.
[01:03.20]Alright, this really does sound like... This sounds like somebody was just at like a bar drinking with their buddies and held a microphone in front of someone or their friends and was just like, hey, can you... Can you do like a fucking shitty pirate voice for me?
[01:20.29]Alright, this swear guy is seriously driving me crazy.
[01:29.16]Be brave, motherfuckers.
[01:31.46]This is all he does.
[01:33.06]There's a guy on this boat that's just saying a variation of the same insult.
[01:37.57]Be brave, pile of shit.
[01:39.57]It's like he's telling us to be brave and at the same sentence he's calling us names.
[01:43.93]Which one is it?
[01:46.07]Be brave, fuckers.
[01:48.29]We're sinking.
[01:54.38]We don't die today, you bitches.
[01:56.22]What?
[02:13.14]Well, first I'm gonna stab him.
[02:14.62]And then I'm gonna butt him.
[02:15.98]And then I'm gonna butt him again.
[02:17.42]And then I'm gonna butt him again.
[02:18.84]And then I'm gonna stab him.
[02:20.21]And then I'm gonna stab him.
[02:25.11]I guess a cup of drinks would make me figure this all out.
[02:27.23]You in trouble?
[02:29.93]Why does it keep telling me to do the fear skill?
[02:32.73]Do I have to... I did not mean to shoot that guy.
[02:34.78]Didn't mean to kill that guy.
[02:35.60]I really didn't.
[02:36.18]I'm trying to do the fear skill.
[02:38.44]Nobody seems to care, though.
[02:39.52]Apparently that guy... Nobody cares about that guy.
[02:42.74]Everyone's cool.
[02:43.36]We're all right.
[02:43.88]We're good.
[02:46.66]Oh, look.
[02:46.94]A guy sleeping on the dock.
[02:48.72]What do you know?
[02:50.33]Hey, who's got a gun here?
[02:51.39]You're gonna put a gun on me?
[02:52.05]What, are you crazy, man?
[02:52.73]I just didn't put somebody's eye out.
[02:54.31]I'm tired.
[02:54.81]I'm going back to bed.
[02:56.01]I think I'm go- No, wait!
[02:56.83]You got a gun still?
[02:57.49]Oh, my God, dude.
[02:58.01]You're gonna kill somebody with that thing.
[02:59.57]I'm sleepy.
[03:00.25]I'm going back- I'm not tired anymore.
[03:01.85]You think I'm tired?
[03:02.85]No, I am tired.
[03:03.93]No, I'm gonna wake up now because you got a gun.
[03:05.79]I think this guy's crazy.
[03:06.91]I'm tired again.
[03:07.81]No, I'm not tired.
[03:08.63]You think I'm tired?
[03:09.27]Fuck you.
[03:09.79]I'm tired again.
[03:10.62]Oh, hey!
[03:13.46]I don't want to fight these guys.
[03:15.87]I'm riding around like a dinghy boat, and these guys are shooting like 300.
[03:19.17]Oh my god.
[03:23.49]There's no way I'm gonna be able to fight these guys.
[03:26.61]I just, at like 2%, I did like not even 1% damage.
[03:30.10]We're like instantly getting killed.
[03:32.74]I can't even turn the wheel.
[03:36.56]You need me.
[03:38.50]No.
[03:44.89]Who's saying you need me?
[03:47.69]No.
[03:49.22]Why is that the fucking reverse of yeah?
[03:53.12]No.
[03:55.18]No.
[03:55.90]No.
[03:58.83]Oh shit, there's a prisoner in here.
[04:01.03]Get me out of here!
[04:03.93]That's not a very secure prison.
[04:07.89]Excuse me.
[04:08.61]Just go the other way.
[04:10.11]Could I use half a crown now?
[04:12.19]I don't even know what that means.
[04:13.69]You just said a nonsense statement.
[04:15.53]Just please go out the door.
[04:16.27]I'm sorry, I'm on my way.
[04:17.41]Yeah, get on your way.
[04:18.21]Go.
[04:19.71]I'm gonna block this side of the door, so you have to fucking go this way.
[04:22.37]I'm sorry, I'm on my way.
[04:27.35]Go.
[04:27.41]Turd sniffer?
[04:28.27]Did he just call me a turd sniffer?
[04:35.48]They're all, like, bumbling all over each other and, like, saying, excuse me, and, like, oh, I don't want any trouble.
[04:39.81]Whoa!
[04:40.83]Oh!
[04:42.09]Oh!
[04:45.09]God, dude, this is... I can't beat this.
[04:50.76]I can't beat this, like, hen house.
[04:55.54]That's all I hear.
[04:56.24]This is literally the only... That's all I fucking hear right now.
[05:00.52]It's making me want to die!
[05:03.52]Go, go, go, go, go.
[05:07.26]I mean, did I get out?
[05:09.51]Please tell me I got out of that nightmare.
[05:15.79]You cannot be serious right now.
[05:17.71]What?
[05:35.73]Wait a second.
[05:36.57]Don't even tell me.
[05:39.13]Is this lady...
[05:40.33]What?!
[05:41.89]No!
[05:44.24]Yeah, this is a lady pissing into a bush.
[05:48.88]God, they keep tempting me.
[05:50.18]Stop tempting me with this!
[05:52.32]Come on!
[05:53.88]I, like, don't want to do this!
[05:55.64]They keep putting them in the perfect spot for you to push them off the giant scaffolding.
[06:01.27]Do you have any idea how hard it is to not do that?
[06:04.29]Look, again!
[06:05.31]And this guy's pissing!
[06:09.12]No, he's not.
[06:10.16]What is this guy doing?
[06:14.00]Oh, he's throwing up.
[06:15.06]He's throwing up into an invisible ground.
[06:23.17]I don't know why.
[06:25.25]Wait, was that the guy I was supposed to talk to?
[06:29.34]You guys notice something?
[06:35.15]Anything seem a little off to you guys at all?
[06:38.53]Just listen.
[06:40.51]They patched him out of the game.
[06:48.58]The last clip you saw was like two and a half days ago.
[06:52.19]They removed... This is all new dialogue on the boat.
[06:55.97]Anytime you go on the boat now, it's this.
[06:58.89]What were the patch notes?
[07:00.05]Did they say like, oh, we removed the scream, swears, be brave guy.
[07:04.01]We apologize for his uncalled for insults.
[07:08.51]And he has been removed.
[07:09.47]I want him back.
[07:10.67]Where is he?
[07:11.55]He was an integral part of my crew.
