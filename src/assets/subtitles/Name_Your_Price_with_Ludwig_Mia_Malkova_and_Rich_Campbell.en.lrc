[00:05.64]President Nixon's favorite show.
[00:07.76]Name your prize.
[00:09.00]Absolutely.
[00:09.68]Our next contestant is definitely not photoshopped and is very caked up.
[00:15.63]Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Jerma!
[00:23.13]Jerma, welcome to the show.
[00:24.61]How are you, my friend?
[00:25.73]Great to be here.
[00:26.39]Great to be here.
[00:26.91]I tell you what, Will, when I heard Jerma was going to be on the show, I blacked out and woke up wearing nothing but a cigarette.
[00:32.70]Wow.
[00:33.46]Yeah.
[00:34.12]That's a great outfit.
[00:34.90]That happens to you a lot.
[00:35.44]That's a great outfit.
[00:36.30]Yeah, it does.
[00:37.28]It's a fantastic outfit.
[00:38.78]You've got bugs.
[00:39.84]Yeah.
[00:40.32]Where was the cigarette?
[00:41.30]You've got bugs.
[00:42.98]Now, let me tell you something, folks.
[00:46.29]We've had a couple episodes to name your prize.

[00:48.99]Let me tell you.
[00:49.73]We're two seasons in.
[00:50.85]Yeah, we're two seasons in.
[00:52.33]The first episode this season was an absolute mess.
[00:55.28]Last week came down, or a couple weeks ago, came down to the wire.
[00:58.42]Wire?
[00:58.78]Between Sycuno and Leslie.
[01:00.76]Oh, yeah.
[01:01.14]It was an intense round.
[01:02.18]Real barn burner.
[01:03.00]Real barn burner.
[01:04.06]Speaking of wires, when do we get paid?
[01:07.51]Alright!
[01:08.51]Okay.
[01:10.13]Well, how much do you get paid?
[01:11.87]I get a membership to the Jelly of the Month Club here in Pocat... whatever, whatever.
[01:16.62]Pocatello.
[01:17.32]I don't know what city we're in.
[01:18.96]You don't even know what city we're in.
[01:20.64]I'm dyslexic, okay?
[01:22.60]It's a Nickelodeon T-shirt from the listing.
[01:25.88]This vintage 1990 Nickelodeon Studios T-shirt
[01:30.06]It comes from Universal Studios Florida.
[01:32.02]It's a green shirt with a single stitch and short sleeves.
[01:34.82]It ships from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
[01:38.24]Look at it.
[01:39.26]Hey, now.
[01:39.90]Rich.
[01:40.24]It's a cotton or polyester?
[01:41.96]Oh, it's cotton.
[01:43.16]OK.
[01:43.42]Alright.
[01:44.30]OK.
[01:45.24]Taking half of everything.
[01:46.12]I don't want you to know.
[01:46.95]Ludwig, get your eyes off of him.
[01:48.21]What?
[01:48.91]Eyes off of him.
[01:49.73]I wasn't looking.
[01:50.25]I was looking at his cock.
[01:51.79]Oh.
[01:53.07]That's allowed.
[01:54.45]Jerma, let's hear it.
[01:55.17]You said cotton?
[01:59.50]You said cotton.
[02:00.73]Cotton.

[02:07.25]$29.99.
[02:07.39]That's a good answer.
[02:08.87]That's actually a good answer.
[02:11.35]Ladies and gentlemen, the first points of the day go to Ludwig.
[02:17.39]Ludwig, $55.
[02:19.27]What if that is overpriced?
[02:21.27]$55.
[02:21.57]Oh, my god.
[02:22.13]Is he sick?
[02:22.71]What the hell?
[02:23.11]Is he screaming?
[02:23.87]Let's go.
[02:24.17]Get away from me.
[02:25.31]Get away from me.
[02:35.32]Here we go.
[02:36.24]This next item right here is a Chippendales calendar.
[02:41.14]Oh, yeah.
[02:42.88]Look at that.
[02:44.40]Look at those hunks.
[02:45.62]Oh, my God.
[02:47.64]Oh, let's keep flipping through the pages.
[02:49.28]Why is there a box?
[02:50.63]Oh!
[02:52.91]Oh, my God.
[02:54.37]Wowzer.

[03:03.84]Flip through it.
[03:04.42]Flip through it.
[03:05.84]I wouldn't lick it too much there, buddy.
[03:07.73]Well, that's a full page.
[03:08.59]Alright.
[03:09.53]Whoa.
[03:10.53]Whoa.
[03:10.87]What do we got for September?
[03:11.85]Oh, that guy's hot.
[03:12.75]Look at that.
[03:13.67]Hold on.
[03:14.07]Hold on.
[03:14.47]I got to wait till I get to my month.
[03:18.38]Wow.
[03:18.64]Is that my month?
[03:19.46]Wow.
[03:21.01]Alright.
[03:21.45]There we go.
[03:22.25]There we go.
[03:23.95]Rick!
[03:24.25]Rick!
[03:24.49]Rick, would you just stay at your podium?
[03:27.06]Rick, please.
[03:27.60]What's this tiny tank top?
[03:28.96]Look at that.
[03:30.40]Thanks.
[03:30.80]Put that in my dressing room.
[03:31.82]I have insider info, Jeremy.
[03:33.16]Oh, you do?
[03:34.96]What you don't know is that it had the price on the back.
[03:37.86]It had the price on the back?
[03:38.90]That's right.
[03:40.36]You didn't take the price off the back?
[03:41.48]Wait, it had the price on the back?
[03:42.56]Yeah, it did.
[03:43.32]It did.
[03:43.64]Alright, but it's what we paid for it, Ludwig.
[03:46.29]What are you telling me?
[03:47.01]You're not paying retail?
[03:48.65]No, of course not.
[03:49.65]What do you pay above retail?
[03:50.63]They're not paying retail, Ludwig.
[03:52.29]Above retail?
[03:53.53]Jerma, what do you think?
[03:56.85]What do you think, Jerma?
[03:57.67]$15.
[03:58.37]$15! $15!
[04:02.93]$15, okay.
[04:03.89]All these $9.99, $8.99, $10.
[04:04.67]No, no, no, no.
[04:06.21]Alright, Ludwig said he had the secret sauce.
[04:11.76]$9.99.
[04:13.40]Retail price was $7.95.
[04:15.38]I think this one's all Jerma.
[04:16.98]But hold on, wait a second.
[04:18.38]Ludwig, it was from 1994.
[04:21.66]It's from 1994.
[04:22.72]And you know what?
[04:23.36]You know who knew that best and calculated that into their prediction?
[04:27.11]Jerma, 10 points.
[04:30.31]Alright.
[04:31.19]Alright.
[04:31.87]$15.
[04:32.35]Actual price, $53.
[04:33.09]No, $59.
[04:33.65]$59.98.
[04:33.69]You weren't even close.
[04:35.91]I'm going to be honest with you, Will.
[04:38.93]We way overpaid for that.
[04:40.55]Well, that's because they were bidding against you.
[04:42.60]Alright, look at this.
[04:43.58]Here we go.
[04:44.66]It's a first aid kit.
[04:47.46]First aid.
[04:48.41]It's a first aid kit right down here.
[04:52.33]There's Mercury in this.
[04:54.22]What?
[04:55.38]Gotta keep that temperature down.
[04:56.75]Wait, is that...
[04:58.38]Oh, man.
[04:59.82]There's Mercury in there?
[05:01.22]Oh, yeah.
[05:02.02]Oh, yeah.
[05:02.78]Good God.
[05:03.50]Do not inhale that box.
[05:05.04]Good God.
[05:05.64]Alright.
[05:05.96]We're on an asbestos set.
[05:07.40]You're really getting picky about Mercury now?
[05:09.20]Minx!
[05:09.92]Minx!
[05:10.36]This is... Wait, what the hell is a cockroach doing?
[05:14.56]They nest in the asbestos.
[05:16.56]They're multiplying on this table.
[05:18.10]There's a lot.
[05:18.92]Look at this.
[05:19.32]We found it.
[05:20.00]Look at the cockroach.
[05:21.18]Jerma just threw a cockroach.
[05:23.40]Look at this.
[05:23.76]Can we get this?
[05:25.79]Where is it?
[05:26.51]Why is it?
[05:27.19]That's disgusting.
[05:27.83]It's on the ground.
[05:28.31]There's a few of them.
[05:28.84]That disgusts me.
[05:30.24]Look at that.
[05:31.16]Well, there's no BASA tracing.
[05:33.07]There were only two adhesive bandages.
[05:37.07]$12.
[05:37.09]$12.
[05:37.27]$12.
[05:37.29]$12.
[05:37.75]Yeah, you didn't even write it.
[05:41.69]He didn't write a price down.
[05:42.83]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[05:43.33]He wrote 13 by now.
[05:44.71]Whoa.
[05:44.95]He didn't write a price down.
[05:47.41]He copied my answer.
[05:48.44]He copied my answer.
[05:49.14]He put 13 down just now.
[05:49.92]Actually, I wasn't going to bring this up.
[05:51.86]His podium's bigger than mine.
[05:52.98]I want to replace him.
[05:54.60]Look, it's at least a quarter of an inch higher than mine.
[05:57.26]He's got podium envy.
[05:58.32]Did you not read my rider?
[05:59.52]Let me tell you something, you bastard.
[06:01.58]Let me tell you something.
[06:03.39]My podium might be one or two inches bigger than yours, but that doesn't matter.
[06:05.95]You need to relax and go back to what you were doing.
[06:07.79]Yeah, get back to what you were doing.
[06:10.47]Rick, please.
[06:10.85]Hi, lady.
[06:11.49]Rick, please, stand behind your podium.
[06:13.93]And hey, Jerma, we didn't see it this time, but we're going to let it slide.
[06:17.30]But next time, Rick, we're going to be looking at you.
[06:19.20]We've got a bunch of cameras in here, okay?
[06:21.18]Ladies and gentlemen, getting on the board for the first time, Rick Hogg, everybody!
[06:27.00]What?! !
[06:29.22]He looked at my answer.
[06:31.02]$20.
[06:31.10]Good job, honey.
[06:31.78]Jerma, to be honest with you, we didn't see it.
[06:34.33]Oh, we did not.
[06:35.79]There's like 60 people in here.
[06:37.47]We did not see it.
[06:38.59]But Jerma, we're going to review the tape.
[06:41.03]Ladies and gentlemen, when we come back from this commercial break, we're going to have a verdict on whether Rick cheated or not.
[06:46.10]Back with more Name Your Price in a minute, OK?
[06:47.60]This show's a farce.
[06:52.35]we've revealed some footage folks and let me tell you that footage is very scary ferdinand it's very scary ladies and gentlemen rick hogg before honey they finally caught up to us the last round answered 13 when Jerma answered 12. we reviewed the tape
[07:16.58]And we have found that Rick cheated!
[07:19.24]Oh!
[07:20.24]Oh, my God!
[07:22.45]Rick cheated!
[07:23.83]But it's a little long conclusion, so we're going to take away two points from Rick, and we're going to give two points to Jerma, ladies and gentlemen!
[07:32.21]Rick, you're still on the board with three points from the listing, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:40.11]Whoa!
[07:41.85]Whoa!
[07:43.11]Ladies sold separately.
[07:45.94]This chair right here, this one ships from, you guessed it, Bakersfield, California.
[07:52.31]Bakersfield.

[07:56.03]Oh, Jesus.
[07:56.91]Oh, God.
[07:57.33]Alright, just stay right there, Minx.
[07:58.89]You want to see me do a front flip?
[08:00.31]No.
[08:00.95]Yes.
[08:01.27]You have insurance?
[08:04.17]No.
[08:08.92]What do you guys think?
[08:10.02]How much do you think we paid for this?
[08:10.98]It's weirdly tall.
[08:12.22]It could only fit Jerma's frame.
[08:13.84]Not only is it weirdly tall, it was originally designed for CBT.
[08:19.19]I haven't seen that, Jerma.
[08:20.47]I haven't seen that.
[08:22.61]Bring that down for him, Will.
[08:24.47]Oh!
[08:24.83]Wow.
[08:26.18]The athleticism.
[08:28.18]Oh, look at that.
[08:28.98]Okay.
[08:29.78]Okay.
[08:30.62]Alright.
[08:32.64]We are not insured for this.
[08:34.36]Wow, look at that.
[08:35.48]I signed the death warrant.
[08:37.06]The death, whatever it is.
[08:39.32]The death warrant.
[08:40.00]I'm telling you.
[08:41.22]Rick the Hog hasn't guessed anything.
[08:42.88]Do we know how old it is?
[08:43.94]Rick, get your foot off the podium, Rick.
[08:47.56]Rick, stop that, Rick.
[08:49.40]Okay, Jerma, let's hear from you.
[08:53.64]The height is a little bit taller than most chairs.
[08:56.66]Yes.
[08:57.42]The seat was a little rough, but I do think it's made out of mahogany, if I'm correct.
[09:01.19]That's correct.
[09:01.75]Could be.
[09:02.07]$72.
[09:02.09]$72.
[09:02.11]72 smackers.
[09:03.61]Hernan, a little bit more thinking.
[09:07.33]I think that seat was rough.
[09:09.18]You should meet up with me after the show.
[09:11.86]$242!
[09:11.88]$242!
[09:15.02]Ladies and gentlemen, we have the first, second time in history of Name Your Price where somebody has gotten the exact value.
[09:22.11]Oh my gosh!
[09:23.09]Which is going to give them double points.
[09:25.25]Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Mia Balcombe!
[09:28.94]You get to keep the item, too.
[09:30.42]Can I keep the chair?
[09:31.44]He's going over that chair right there.
[09:34.49]The chair is yours.
[09:36.21]Oh, my gosh.
[09:37.75]I mean, you should be off your feet.
[09:39.57]I should be off my feet.
[09:40.55]The listing says... How are they selling it for that much?
[09:43.21]It goes great with leather.
[09:44.73]Round of applause here, folks.
[09:46.11]Let's take a look at the points.
[09:48.17]Let's take a look at the points.
[09:49.32]We've got Ludwig.
[09:50.38]He started off strong.

[09:51.88]He's got 10 points.
[09:53.16]Jerma with 12 points.
[09:54.94]Rick with eight.

[10:11.71]What is this?
[10:14.67]Oh my god, look at that.
[10:16.74]He's beautiful.
[10:17.24]He's a desperado.
[10:18.49]Oh!
[10:19.85]What's going on, Will?
[10:20.69]What is that?
[10:22.96]What's that?
[10:23.56]Mother of God!
[10:25.22]Oh, my goodness!
[10:26.68]It's a showdown!
[10:28.12]Oh, my God!
[10:29.79]This is nuts.
[10:30.71]This town ain't big enough for the two of them.
[10:33.25]Oh, my God!
[10:34.83]Well, it looks like we have a showdown.
[10:38.67]Which one of these gunslingers do you think will win in a shootout?
[10:42.39]Contestants, write down your answer.
[10:45.08]Alright.
[10:46.62]Here we go.
[10:48.18]Ready?

[10:52.83]Two!
[10:53.05]One!
[11:00.44]Oh my god!
[11:03.42]He's dead!
[11:04.48]They both died!
[11:05.50]They both died!
[11:10.06]Oh my god!
[11:12.00]Gun violence is horrible!
[11:14.12]Oh my god!
[11:15.40]It's not like it is in the movies!
[11:17.16]It's not glamorous!
[11:18.44]Okay, no!
[11:21.29]Alright, I want to ask you guys, seriously.
[11:24.11]Yeah.
[11:25.19]How much do you think we... Chuck, you put a cigarette on his eye!
[11:30.99]How?
[11:32.58]I want to ask you seriously.
[11:33.88]I want you to...
[11:35.81]How much do you think we paid to bury these two taxidermy after they're on time?
[11:41.48]Indian burial ground in Pocatello.
[11:43.68]That's right, that's right.
[11:44.54]We're going to bury them under the haunted board.
[11:46.68]Yes.
[11:47.32]Can you imagine if you died and somebody like propped you up with a fucking sun and a taxidermy?
[11:51.24]Yeah, so the chipmunk has been... What the hell?
[11:53.12]...specialty taxidermied to look like an old Western hero.
[11:57.75]You can see...
[11:59.49]He looks like Clint Eastwood there.
[12:01.25]Yeah.
[12:01.59]Alright.
[12:01.81]He's got a snarl.
[12:02.53]He looks like he can be racist.
[12:04.09]This is the most expensive item that we've ever paid.
[12:06.43]What the fuck?
[12:07.36]Okay.
[12:07.90]I mean, that changes everything.
[12:08.90]That's the most expensive item ever.
[12:10.38]It was extra to get the Clint Eastwood edition stand-your-ground chipmunk.
[12:13.40]Most expensive ever.
[12:14.38]What do you mean?
[12:15.28]That we've ever purchased on Name Your Price.
[12:16.78]Ever?
[12:17.26]Ever.
[12:17.88]Yes.
[12:18.59]No, actually, the car was more.
[12:20.59]There was a car that was more expensive than a squirrel?
[12:22.75]Yes.
[12:23.61]Oh, a squirrel and a chipmunk.
[12:24.91]What?
[12:25.63]Yes.
[12:26.03]Hold on.
[12:26.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12:27.35]There was a car that was not as expensive as a squirrel.
[12:31.11]And a chipmunk.
[12:31.77]And a chipmunk.
[12:32.31]No, no, there was a car that was a little bit more expensive.
[12:34.40]Oh, my goodness.
[12:35.64]I got this.
[12:38.66]It's $360.
[12:39.44]$360.
[12:39.46]And I voted for the small guy.
[12:42.52]What happened?
[12:43.76]Why does your board look like you've written a manifesto?
[12:46.85]At one point, I saw I'm running out of $700, and I felt like an idiot.
[12:50.07]No, it's because when you said, who's going to win the fight?
[12:52.21]I said the small guy was going to win.
[12:53.43]There's a $700.
[12:54.01]Oh, I got you.
[12:54.49]That was silly of you.
[12:55.19]It was silly.
[12:55.75]Dramma, you would pick the small guy.
[12:58.97]Of course I would, because the small guy has the biggest package.
[13:01.70]I'm going to go really, really high and say $1,000.
[13:04.20]$1,000.
[13:07.00]Let me tell you.
[13:07.78]You go big or you go home.
[13:09.20]Let me tell you, we paid a grand total of $349.99.
[13:12.94]Dramma, you got it.
[13:19.53]Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
[13:20.73]I had a Steve Harvey moment.
[13:22.44]In $649.99, Rick got it.
[13:24.30]Rick got it.
[13:28.02]I guess it's true what they say.
[13:29.46]Good things come in small packages.
[13:32.13]All righty.
[13:36.47]We are going to show you an image of a person.
[13:39.19]You're going to have to tell me what they do.
[13:41.40]What they do.
[13:42.44]However, whoever answers correctly will receive 20 points.
[13:47.56]Alright?
[13:47.94]20 points.
[13:48.16]Is it a multiple choice scenario?
[13:49.76]It's a multiple choice scenario.
[13:51.22]OK?
[13:52.30]Alright.
[13:53.44]Alright.
[13:54.36]Here we go.
[13:54.96]First, first individual.
[13:57.16]Oh, look at that.
[13:58.02]Oh, look at that.
[14:00.14]I was wondering what he was doing.
[14:01.22]Look at that.
[14:02.18]What did they do?
[14:03.87]Did they deface historical landmarks with spray paint, steal, drove stolen ambulances, drove a stolen ambulance home while detained in a hospital, or return a bag with $120,000 that fell off a truck?
[14:21.50]It's like they refunded Ninja Streamer Academy.
[14:24.86]I also think you don't get your picture taken during a, hold on, let me.
[14:30.59]I also don't think you get your picture taken for, you know, doing a good deed.
[14:33.55]I think that this usually happens.
[14:35.36]That background, the gray background, I think is potentially a person potentially detained.
[14:40.88]Okay.
[14:41.32]I'm going to say two.
[14:42.68]Drove stolen ambulance home.
[14:44.52]Two is not on the board.
[14:45.62]Two is not an option.
[14:47.07]It was B. B, alright.
[14:47.95]Alright, alright.
[14:49.05]He's not saying that because he might have done that at some point.
[14:52.31]Rich.
[14:52.89]He looks like somebody who's in a hospital.
[14:55.31]I'm going to go with B. B. Everybody, everybody chose B. Everybody is wrong.
[15:04.63]Everybody is wrong.
[15:08.39]They defaced a historical landmark with spray paint.
[15:12.63]That's right.
[15:13.39]That's terrible.
[15:14.13]Right here in Pocatello, Idaho.
[15:17.36]Oh, yes.
[15:18.04]Yes.
[15:18.66]He defaced one of those landmarks that everybody's trying to get taken down.
[15:24.28]He defaced the historical Mentos factory.
[15:26.64]That's right.
[15:27.80]Did they get nicknamed the Breakfast Bandit for stealing food from hotel buffets, plead guilty to making meth in a college laboratory, or recover a missing prosthetic leg while on lifeguard duty?
[15:39.68]Oh, shit.
[15:41.20]Rick, I need you to write your answer down.
[15:43.44]Oh, you can't back up more than us.
[15:45.48]Wait, wait, hold on a second.
[15:47.82]You don't want to try me.
[15:48.95]Rick!
[15:50.47]Rick!
[15:51.03]Don't let him see what we're doing.
[15:52.24]Whoa, hey, hey, hey!
[15:54.12]Oh!
[15:54.72]Oh, my God!
[15:56.14]I have my answer.
[15:57.08]Alright.
[15:57.88]No, we need Rick to go first.
[15:59.26]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[16:00.86]Rick's been cheating his face off.
[16:02.62]I have been first, writing down every time, and I feel like everyone's been copying me.
[16:05.72]Jeremy, you've been very good.
[16:07.03]Rick has been a real slime bag.
[16:09.17]I'm going to go with C. C. C. Alright.
[16:13.63]Jerma, what do you think?
[16:14.81]I'd say C, too.
[16:15.90]C, my God.
[16:16.94]There's waves in the background.
[16:18.50]Is it bait?
[16:19.22]Like, oh, he's in front of the ocean.
[16:21.04]That's a lie.
[16:21.92]Ludwig is going down a path less traveled.
[16:24.54]He's going with the breakfast bandit.
[16:26.24]Breakfast bandit.
[16:27.56]Well, let me tell you what they did.
[16:29.84]Let's see.
[16:31.06]It is, Ludwig, you are incorrect.
[16:35.82]Yeah, it was.
[16:37.26]We got it.
[16:37.94]They recovered a missing prosthetic leg while on lifeguard duty.
[16:40.80]Correct.
[16:41.10]20 points to Jerma, Rick, and Mia.
[16:43.28]Yes.
[16:44.64]No, that's a D. That's a D. That's an A. What is this?
[16:49.90]I don't know.
[16:50.62]I'm scratching them out as we go.
[16:52.43]I'm from Atlantic City.
[16:53.83]You'd be amazed the limbs you can find on that beach.
[16:55.79]This is not an answer.
[16:56.73]Alright.
[16:57.47]You can find many limbs in Atlantic City.
[16:59.53]All you got to do is look.
[17:01.19]Okay.
[17:01.33]That's right.
[17:02.53]Alright.
[17:02.99]Here we go.
[17:04.71]What did they do?
[17:06.63]What'd they do?
[17:07.51]How can you not get the title right?
[17:08.81]Alright, whatever.
[17:09.65]What'd they do?
[17:10.91]What'd they do?
[17:12.19]What does it make sense?
[17:13.63]What does it make sense?
[17:14.37]Did they get arrested?
[17:15.60]Did they get arrested for torching their business for insurance money, portray a lawyer in a stock photo, or become president and COO of Coca-Cola?
[17:27.66]Jerma, what do you think?
[17:29.22]If this was the president and CEO of Coca-Cola, there'd be a Coca-Cola brand label behind them.
[17:33.76]Ah, good answer.
[17:35.42]Hey, okay.
[17:38.83]Ludwig, what do you think?
[17:39.81]This is Mark Sherrill, the president and CEO of Coca-Cola.
[17:43.25]Ludwig!
[17:44.09]And I believe this is the man who changed Coke's recipe to the new recipe, and then they had to change it to Coke Classic.
[17:51.33]Thanks for the dividends, Mark.
[17:52.57]Ladies and gentlemen, Ludwig, you're correct!
[17:56.26]20 points for Ludwig.
[17:58.47]Incorrect.
[17:59.13]Ludwig, you've gotten yourself back in the game with 30 points.
[18:03.11]Did they punch their Domino's delivery driver for forgetting garlic knots?
[18:06.89]Oh, we've all been there.
[18:08.51]Throw a live alligator through a Wendy's drive-thru window.
[18:11.38]Oh, we've all been there.
[18:12.60]That's right.
[18:13.48]Or set a Guinness World Record for drinking two liters of soda in 18 seconds.
[18:17.44]I have not been there.
[18:18.84]You've not been there?
[18:19.54]I have not been there.
[18:21.04]Okay.
[18:21.94]Jeremiah?
[18:23.56]What do you think?
[18:24.24]You should get two answers.
[18:25.12]I think B is logistically not possible.
[18:28.06]Okay.
[18:28.48]How do you do that?
[18:29.07]How would that even be possible?
[18:29.95]Very carefully.
[18:30.65]I think A is... Back to front.
[18:33.25]I mean, the Badlands Chug is obviously legendary, but I think C. C.
[18:39.23]Nobody chucks like Mr. Bennett.
[18:40.93]Okay.
[18:41.79]What'd they do?
[18:43.11]What'd they do?
[18:44.76]The correct answer is they actually threw a live alligator through.
[18:48.76]What?
[18:49.00]Oh, yeah.
[18:51.02]What?
[18:51.64]In West Palm Beach, Florida, Ludwig, 20 points.
[18:54.86]LUDWIG HAS BEEN ON A TEAR.
[18:57.08]LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, LUDWIG, WITH THAT, YOU HAVE TAKEN THE BREAK.
[19:01.67]YOU HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD THIS NEXT GAME, WILL.
[19:05.89]LET'S TAKE THAT OUT HERE.
[19:06.75]WE HAVE ANOTHER GAME WE'RE GOING TO PLAY HERE ON NAME YOUR PRIZE, BUT FIRST LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE POINTS.
[19:11.71]LUDWIG WITH THE LEAD.
[19:12.85]50 POINTS, EVERYBODY.
[19:14.69]WOW.
[19:15.96]Jerma with 32, Rick with 38, and Mia with 40.
[19:20.32]It's anybody's game, Will.
[19:22.36]Here, this is what we're going to do.
[19:23.64]We got another game to play.
[19:25.12]This game, 30 points per correct answer.
[19:28.88]We are going to bring out some sealed food, products in their original packaging.
[19:35.93]Based on looks, you're going to tell me the month and year that it expired.
[19:40.43]Alright.
[19:40.89]This is a game we like to call Certified Fresh.
[19:44.65]Okay.
[19:45.51]That is correct.
[19:47.16]Alright.
[19:48.08]This next item, first item, I should say, is Hawaiian Punch.
[19:52.84]It contains seven real fruit juices.
[19:55.86]The label says it has 100% vitamin C, and it's packaged in a glass bottle.
[20:02.60]Look at that.
[20:03.58]Be very careful.
[20:04.40]You really got to see the shade of brown that this is.
[20:06.44]Look at this.
[20:07.18]So when did this expire?
[20:08.88]That's what we're guessing.
[20:10.22]Month and year or just year?
[20:11.75]I'm trying to look, Ludwig.
[20:13.79]I see Ludwig.
[20:14.95]They taped it up, those fuckers.
[20:16.65]Yeah, we taped it.
[20:17.57]Month and year.
[20:19.78]That last bottle, I believe, was discontinued somewhere into the mid-90s.
[20:23.78]Okay.
[20:24.70]I love Hawaiian Punch.
[20:25.66]It's one of my favorite beverages ever made.
[20:27.14]Yep.
[20:27.54]Let's see.
[20:27.90]I'm going to say this expired in June 1995.
[20:30.32]June 1995.
[20:34.31]June 1995.
[20:35.31]Here we go.
[20:35.97]Come on.
[20:36.51]This expired in the year.
[20:38.11]Come on.
[20:38.49]No whammies.
[20:38.93]1982, March 1982.
[20:41.79]Ludwig, you're correct.
[20:43.37]No!
[20:43.51]No!
[20:49.38]20 points for Ludwig.
[20:53.07]What a guess.
[20:54.57]Peko Flake Bar.
[20:56.95]Oh, it's a peko flake.
[20:59.03]This candy bar contains peanuts, corn, and coconut.
[21:02.11]It feels both incredibly dense, yet brittle.
[21:04.70]The price on the packaging is listed for 39 cents.
[21:07.86]All this peko flake, just 39 cents.
[21:10.80]That's right.
[21:13.32]He hasn't cheated at all.
[21:14.54]39 cents, Chad.
[21:15.23]You can guess the year if you want.
[21:16.65]Is it okay if I touch the sweets?
[21:19.85]What?
[21:21.45]Oh.
[21:22.66]1986.
[21:22.84]1980.
[21:22.92]No month.
[21:25.13]No month.
[21:27.49]Minx, no.
[21:28.63]Minx, no.
[21:29.71]Minx, no.
[21:30.61]Minx, no.
[21:31.67]Minx, no.
[21:32.61]Minx, I can smell the peckle flakes already.
[21:35.13]It smells nuclear.
[21:37.08]Please, Minx.
[21:38.74]Minx, please.
[21:40.00]Get off.
[21:40.66]Get the baloney from the fridge.
[21:41.96]She's so strong.
[21:43.10]Why does she look so strong?
[21:44.30]She's so strong.
[21:44.96]Oh, my God.
[21:45.50]Minx.
[21:45.70]Oh, it's ripping.
[21:47.50]Oh.
[21:48.21]Oh.
[21:49.95]Oh.
[21:51.20]Oh my god!
[21:52.20]This caused an outbreak!
[21:54.08]Oh my god!
[21:55.10]You are running the show for the peco disease it caused.
[21:59.41]Oh, my God.
[22:00.11]Does it smell?
[22:01.23]Okay.
[22:02.23]Alright.
[22:02.75]Minx, if you keep it up, you're not invited to Thanksgiving.
[22:05.05]Okay.
[22:06.19]Okay.
[22:07.07]Alright.
[22:07.55]That was a very extreme reaction.
[22:09.23]I think I got it right on the money.
[22:10.33]I think this is February 1971.
[22:11.85]February 1971.
[22:12.25]2016.
[22:12.47]December 1969.
[22:13.47]December 1969.
[22:16.53]That was nice.
[22:19.61]It was December 1969.
[22:21.23]Mia, that was really close, but not close enough.
[22:23.18]Jerma, 20 points.
[22:23.80]Yeah.
[22:25.68]This expired in July of 1974.
[22:30.18]The packaging is destroyed.
[22:31.84]There's nothing to show.
[22:32.73]Good my God.
[22:34.17]Here we go.
[22:35.25]This is no cough cough syrup.
[22:37.45]This is a honey flavored cough syrup for kids.
[22:39.91]The bottle says it's for coughs made from colds.
[22:42.86]Wow.
[22:43.64]Spelled N-O-K-O-F, by the way.
[22:46.18]No call.
[22:46.54]Manufactured for Bacon Products Company.
[22:49.50]Was made in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
[22:52.22]Side effects may include deep sleep.
[22:55.02]C-O-C-I-L-A-N-A.
[22:56.91]Co-Celina.
[22:58.97]Co-Celana.
[22:59.79]What the heck is that?
[23:01.39]Yeah, Co-Celina.
[23:02.23]Cock-a-line.
[23:02.53]Cock-a-line.
[23:03.11]No, no thanks.
[23:04.87]Oh.
[23:08.71]Non-zero chance Minx drinks that.
[23:10.31]He's gonna get sick.
[23:10.73]Please.
[23:10.89]No, no, no, Minx, please don't.
[23:11.91]Please.
[23:12.79]Austin's doing the dad voice where he whispers.
[23:15.05]Please.
[23:15.39]I don't know if drinking random decades potentially old chemicals is a good idea.
[23:19.64]So you think it's decades old.
[23:20.64]That's a hint.
[23:21.30]Jeez.
[23:22.24]It's perfectly intact.
[23:24.00]Don't worry.
[23:25.54]That bottle looks very old.
[23:27.08]Yes.
[23:27.38]And the packaging looks very old, too.
[23:28.88]I'm thinking October 1955.
[23:29.64]October 1955.
[23:29.96]Thank you.
[23:34.38]By God, he's not very old.
[23:36.36]Alright.
[23:37.30]The correct answer.
[23:38.35]It's got to be Jerma.
[23:40.37]Let's peel off the expiration date.
[23:42.57]No, it's right on the back.
[23:44.11]December 1963.
[23:44.96]Jerma, you're correct.
[23:50.07]Good guess.
[23:50.51]It was old, but it wasn't that old.
[23:52.07]20 points.
[23:53.16]You're in the lead now.
[23:54.14]We, Chad, I'm hearing right now from our producers, we need to get a hazmat team in here to clean up this set.
[24:01.24]When we come back, it'll be completely safe for everybody to be here.
[24:06.12]We'll be back with more Name Your Price.
[24:07.28]Such a bad reputation for asbestos.
[24:09.20]Yes.
[24:10.38]Can't believe it.
[24:11.68]Can I get some hand sanitizer?
[24:13.72]We got some more games to play here, but let's get a quick score recap.
[24:18.00]Ladies and gentlemen, we've got Ludwig with 70 points, but Jerma just took the lead before the break at 72 points.
[24:25.82]This next game is called Finish Me Off.
[24:32.71]Alright.
[24:35.18]I'm going to show you something we typed into a search engine, and you're going to have to tell me one of the 10 predictive search terms that popped up.
[24:44.83]Oh, love this game.
[24:46.65]Ooh, Ludwig is dialed in.
[24:47.79]I'll give you an example.
[24:48.81]If we typed in, why does my, one of the predictive searches that pops up,
[24:54.31]is why does my cat wake me up so early?
[24:57.95]Here we go.
[24:58.67]Finish me off.
[25:00.41]I have a crush on my... Blank.
[25:04.87]Alright, Jerma.
[25:05.77]I have a crush on my... I mean, on my friend.
[25:09.86]On my friend.
[25:10.90]Good answer.
[25:11.68]Good answer.
[25:12.16]It is up there.
[25:13.08]20 points for Jerma.
[25:14.18]It's on the board.
[25:15.60]Here we go.
[25:16.40]Finish me off, Jerma.
[25:18.12]How do I tell my partner... También.
[25:22.02]Ooh.
[25:24.16]Jerma?
[25:24.56]Whoa.
[25:26.57]Jerma is deep in thought.
[25:28.55]He's playing an imaginary trombone now.
[25:31.19]I got mine.
[25:33.43]I want to break up.
[25:34.37]Whoa!
[25:36.05]How do I tell my partner I want to break up?
[25:39.15]Correct!
[25:41.47]25!
[25:41.63]Yes!
[25:42.93]Alright.
[25:43.63]Next one.
[25:44.31]Rick, you're going to go first here.
[25:45.85]Finish me off.
[25:47.47]Why does it feel good to... Oh, daddy.
[25:53.58]What about... Why does it feel good to jerk off your little pee-pee?
[26:01.35]Why does it feel good to jerk off your little pee-pee?
[26:03.71]Why did you describe it as little?
[26:05.37]It is not on the board!
[26:08.11]That's a pretty clear-cut answer.
[26:10.66]Yeah, why would somebody search that?
[26:11.86]What if you don't know how it works?
[26:13.84]Why does it feel good?
[26:15.60]Do you know why?
[26:16.42]Why does it feel good?
[26:17.40]Because you're doing it.
[26:19.20]Alright, Jeremy, you can take a commanding lead right here.
[26:21.83]Oh, and I am about to.
[26:23.41]I'm about to.
[26:23.99]If you produce a better answer than jerking off your little boy, Pee-Pee.
[26:27.25]Yeah.
[26:28.01]Jesus Christ, so many words.
[26:30.69]Say this.
[26:31.73]Why does it feel good to fart?
[26:33.77]To fart?
[26:34.93]To fart.
[26:35.57]It's not a good answer.
[26:38.58]No, no, no.
[26:40.62]Was poop on there?
[26:42.73]Poop was on there.
[26:43.82]I was going to say must be.
[26:45.86]Twitch streamers are, Mia, you're going first.
[26:49.46]Finish us off, Mia.
[26:51.82]Jerma, what do you think?
[26:54.60]Twitch streamers are cringe.
[26:57.07]Oh.
[26:57.23]Cringe.
[26:58.15]That is on there, 20 points.
[27:00.87]That's not a Google search.
[27:02.45]That's a Reddit post.
[27:03.27]What is this?
[27:04.71]All righty.
[27:05.53]We've got a close game, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:07.64]Ludwig with 90 points.
[27:09.52]Well, close game with these two.
[27:11.76]The rest of them.
[27:12.94]Well, actually, Mia's in there, too.
[27:14.70]Ludwig, 90 points.
[27:16.40]Jerma with 132.
[27:18.10]Rick with 58.
[27:19.36]Mia with 80.
[27:19.80]It's still anybody's game when we come back for more Name Your Bras.
[27:29.37]This game...
[27:36.70]I'm going to show you an item, and you're going to guess how much that item weighs.
[27:42.96]Whoever guesses closest to the actual weight will win 30 points.
[27:47.52]Alright.
[27:49.32]That's a lot of points.
[27:50.56]We've got a wheelbarrow full of books.
[27:55.42]Okay.
[27:57.04]Wheelbarrow full of books.
[27:58.76]Here we go.
[27:59.54]Oh, my God.
[28:00.28]Oh, my God.
[28:02.02]Oh, my God.
[28:04.17]Oh, my God.
[28:05.27]Okay.
[28:06.05]Careful now, Migs.
[28:07.11]Careful, Migs.
[28:08.29]You got it.
[28:08.91]You got it, Migs.
[28:10.29]Oh.
[28:10.75]Oh.
[28:11.25]Okay.
[28:11.81]Alright.
[28:12.15]Here we go.
[28:13.25]Here we have a copy of Lord, I Need Another Bowl of Popcorn.
[28:19.34]Wow.
[28:19.76]Is it a fake book?
[28:20.74]No, it's a page turner.
[28:21.56]No, it's a very real book.
[28:23.69]Jerma?
[28:24.29]Solid.
[28:25.35]I would say 180 or 86 kilograms.
[28:28.35]180 or 86 kilograms.
[28:31.45]I know a little bit about science.
[28:32.93]Ludwig?
[28:33.73]201 pounds.
[28:36.21]201 pounds.
[28:37.41]Will, let's put it on the weight machine.
[28:41.30]Alright, mate.
[28:41.90]You mean a scale?
[28:42.76]Yes.
[28:43.44]Add that book on there, too.
[28:45.02]Yeah, don't forget that last book.
[28:45.82]That book's got to be up there.
[28:46.62]Don't forget that.
[28:47.06]And you've got to put it down with all...
[28:49.36]Alright, we really tested this one, didn't we?
[28:51.23]Oh, Jerma's guess is so good.
[28:52.83]150 pounds.
[28:53.81]Add that book.
[28:57.27]Add that book.
[28:58.09]50 pounds.
[29:00.79]Oh, wait.
[29:01.33]230 pounds.
[29:02.97]I'm just kidding.
[29:04.67]150 pounds.
[29:05.47]Jerma, you're correct.
[29:06.79]30 points.
[29:07.57]How does that weigh less than me?
[29:08.97]There we go.
[29:11.17]Nice and easy.
[29:13.63]Okay.
[29:15.15]Alright.
[29:16.21]God, we didn't really think this one through, did we?
[29:18.19]No, we didn't.
[29:18.77]There you go.
[29:19.29]That's going to be there the rest of the time.
[29:21.20]Okay.
[29:21.46]Alright.
[29:22.72]Next item.
[29:24.08]Oh, God.
[29:25.10]Oh, shit.
[29:26.10]Okay.
[29:26.60]Where's the popcorn book?
[29:27.98]I do think the placement matters.
[29:29.60]If you modify the fulcrum, it's going to completely rig it.
[29:33.27]Rich, would you shut up?
[29:34.13]You're not going to win the game anyway.
[29:36.03]We've got the next item.
[29:37.35]Jerma, get out of the books.
[29:38.33]I want that popcorn book.
[29:39.27]I want to read the whole thing.
[29:40.09]No, Jerma.
[29:40.73]No, I'm keeping Lord.
[29:41.81]I'm dead serious.
[29:42.81]I want that.
[29:43.10]Jerma, we'll get you the popcorn book.
[29:44.90]How's that more than 13 sentences?
[29:47.28]We'll get you the book.
[29:48.72]Can we get the popcorn book?
[29:50.22]Next item here, held by the lovely minx, is... Oh, there's one of them.
[29:56.03]A bunch of old cell phones.
[29:57.61]I used to have to do that in my old job.
[29:59.19]Yes.
[29:59.89]Wait a minute.
[30:00.85]How much...
[30:03.06]Does this box of cell phones weigh?
[30:05.48]Put it in here, Rick.
[30:06.00]We need the weight, sir.
[30:07.04]Rick, we need the weight.
[30:08.14]I need more batteries for my juicer.
[30:09.80]Can I feel this?
[30:10.58]Because that wasn't fair.
[30:11.52]Okay.
[30:12.04]Okay.
[30:12.98]This actually kind of seems like a pretty touching story.
[30:14.53]Yeah.
[30:15.15]Oh, is that funny?
[30:17.77]Alright.
[30:18.25]We need your guesses, folks.
[30:20.81]30 pounds.
[30:21.59]30 pounds.
[30:22.69]Did he see it?
[30:23.43]He probably saw it.
[30:24.27]Let's hear your guess.
[30:25.99]Maybe 15 pounds?
[30:29.03]Maybe 15.
[30:29.53]22 pounds from Ludwig and Jerma.
[30:31.29]28.
[30:31.81]28 pounds.
[30:33.93]Actual guess, exactly 25 pounds.
[30:39.46]Ludwig, 30 points!
[30:40.76]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[30:42.42]We're both equal distance away.
[30:43.90]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[30:44.46]Wait, no, no, no.
[30:45.74]No, hold on.
[30:46.10]We need to zoom in.
[30:46.83]This is 24 pounds.
[30:47.77]24 pounds?
[30:48.29]Which means Ludwig gets 30 points!
[30:53.90]120 points for Ludwig, 162 for Jerma, 58 for Rick, and 80 for Ludwig.
[31:03.13]Alright.
[31:04.01]We've got one last item to weigh here.
[31:07.37]Ooh, that's right.
[31:08.11]It's Fast and Furious.
[31:09.37]It's Fast and Furious.
[31:10.89]Our next item coming in is... Oh, my God.
[31:15.58]It's a Power Whip.
[31:17.02]Oh, God.
[31:17.74]Oh, Jesus.
[31:18.34]Oh, my God.
[31:19.46]No.
[31:19.96]Thanks.
[31:20.80]Not...
[31:21.94]Oh, no, Manx, stop!
[31:23.12]Put your foot off the gas!
[31:24.88]Foot off the gas!
[31:26.18]Manx!
[31:27.06]Foot off the gas!
[31:28.36]That's the... Don't!
[31:29.61]No more!
[31:30.33]Alright.
[31:31.65]Without Manx.
[31:32.71]What?
[31:33.03]That was a question.
[31:34.23]Manx!
[31:34.55]Oh, my God!
[31:35.17]Alright, I'll hold it back.
[31:37.31]Austin, hold it back.
[31:38.09]She's aiming for our podium.
[31:40.09]You do not have the liability insurance for this.
[31:42.15]I know that.
[31:42.61]No, Manx.
[31:43.53]I'm stepping back.
[31:44.18]Don't!
[31:45.04]Manx, you promised nothing.
[31:45.94]Manx, if you crash into electrical electricity... I know, I know.
[31:48.72]Okay.
[31:54.09]She's got something in her eyes that tells me she's going to do it a third time.
[31:56.49]Okay, here we go.
[31:57.25]I'd be more than get fired if I did that.
[32:00.33]Okay.
[32:02.39]You thought, I mean, show that guess.
[32:05.20]Alright.
[32:05.80]And it's okay.
[32:06.54]Rick, Rick, let's see your guess.
[32:08.06]Show his guess.
[32:09.24]Rick.
[32:09.48]You thought she cleanly picked up and then curled 160?
[32:12.08]That's so much work.
[32:13.90]Rich.
[32:14.16]Rich.
[32:15.64]Rich.
[32:15.94]I don't think three of us.
[32:17.42]We've got Rich's guess.
[32:18.74]He thinks it weighs 160 pounds.
[32:20.59]That would take all of us.
[32:22.99]Is that a lot?
[32:23.83]It's a lot.
[32:24.73]I'm 160.
[32:25.21]What?
[32:25.65]I'm 160.
[32:25.77]Yeah.
[32:28.27]Alright, Ludwig, what do you think?
[32:29.27]Or Jerma, what do you think?
[32:30.63]I also said 50 pounds.
[32:32.49]50 pounds?
[32:33.33]It's going to be, come on.
[32:35.73]It's going to be like a month.
[32:36.83]48.
[32:36.89]Alright.
[32:37.41]46.
[32:37.45]No, no, this is going to be like, because the scale's offset by like 15 pounds.
[32:41.62]It pops in.
[32:42.26]It's perfect.
[32:42.66]That's true.
[32:43.28]Alright.
[32:43.88]I think it's going to be like 77.
[32:46.28]I think my guess is good.
[32:47.26]Alright.
[32:48.14]Everybody's guessed.
[32:49.06]Show it to me.
[32:49.40]Put it on the scale.
[32:50.14]Here we go.
[32:50.72]Hold on.
[32:51.08]Ready?
[32:51.76]I'd like to lift it.
[32:52.68]No, Megs.
[32:54.76]Alright.
[32:55.54]Okay.
[32:57.40]Jesus Christ.
[32:58.12]Why are you so weak?
[32:59.64]It looks decently.
[33:00.62]It doesn't look 50 pounds.
[33:01.66]I'll tell you what.
[33:03.18]Nice job.
[33:03.68]We need that on there.
[33:04.36]Nice job, Will.
[33:05.08]We need that on there.
[33:05.74]60.
[33:10.49]We need this on there.
[33:11.21]Bitch.
[33:11.41]Bitch.
[33:11.69]Everybody stop touching it.
[33:13.11]This is part of it.
[33:14.95]I won.
[33:16.87]No, wait.
[33:17.21]Meg, stop.
[33:18.17]No, people are putting weight on it.
[33:19.31]You're putting weight on it.
[33:20.55]Hold on, everybody.
[33:21.35]Back away.
[33:24.03]60.
[33:24.63]That's like 69.
[33:25.97]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[33:30.05]Are we sure that it's all on the scale?
[33:31.47]What if we adjust it a bit?
[33:33.21]It's all on the scale.
[33:34.31]That's 60.
[33:34.55]Hey, hey, hey, it's going to come forward a little bit.
[33:36.87]It's leaning.
[33:38.20]Hold on.
[33:38.50]Oh, it's true.
[33:39.76]Thank you.
[33:40.22]Can you show us?
[33:41.18]I don't think the viewers can see.
[33:42.30]There we go.
[33:43.24]Just bring it forward just a skosh.
[33:45.46]Hey, also, don't let it rest on your hands.
[33:47.98]I'm not letting it rest.
[33:48.76]Hey, Phil, let's show us all here.
[33:50.02]What do you think?
[33:51.42]Alright, here we go.
[33:53.38]Watch that elbow.
[33:54.43]It is 90, real 90.
[33:55.75]Phil, can you hear me?
[33:56.67]Show us all here.
[33:58.21]It looks like it's 61.
[33:59.23]I think they're both right.
[34:00.13]This doesn't matter until the end.
[34:01.81]Alright.
[34:02.80]Rich!
[34:04.32]Okay.
[34:05.48]Alright.
[34:08.24]Yeah, it's 61.
[34:09.48]62 pounds, which means Jerma and me are right.
[34:14.12]Jerma and Mia are correct.
[34:16.48]Each of them, 30 points.
[34:20.56]Welcome back to Name Your Prize.
[34:25.92]Alright.
[34:27.58]Ladies and gentlemen, I've been telling you all, all show.
[34:30.98]Oh, yeah.
[34:32.14]That it's still anybody's game right up until the end.
[34:35.76]That's right.
[34:37.11]Ladies and gentlemen.
[34:39.91]Oh, boy.
[34:40.17]That's me.
[34:41.01]That's me.
[34:41.63]Who's got their cell phone on?
[34:43.39]Hello?
[34:44.95]No, what do you mean?
[34:46.53]No, he can walk home.
[34:48.88]It's only 10 miles.
[34:51.50]No, he's fine.
[34:52.70]Okay, okay, okay.
[34:54.68]Austin, I gotta go.
[34:55.70]I left my kid at karate.
[34:57.35]You left your kid at, you have a kid?
[34:58.99]Yeah, I left him there yesterday.
[35:01.67]Will, you dropped him off 10 years ago.
[35:03.41]I was hoping he'd turn into some martial arts legend, but apparently he's just hungry.
[35:07.93]Okay, alright.
[35:08.66]I gotta go.
[35:09.36]Alright, Will, go pick up your kid.
[35:10.88]Deal with your business, I guess.
[35:12.64]Ladies and gentlemen, say hi to the very scary Haunted Board.
[35:20.22]Scary.
[35:21.06]Very scary Haunted Board.
[35:23.47]Behind each one of these numbers are points.
[35:29.41]Some of which you could win.
[35:31.72]Some of which you could lose.
[35:33.60]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[35:35.74]No, we don't applause that.
[35:37.02]That's thunder.
[35:37.50]That's scary.
[35:38.12]There we go.
[35:38.62]Yeah.
[35:39.50]Jerma, you're still in the lead with 192.
[35:42.09]Why don't you pick a number from the board?
[35:46.81]One's got to be low.
[35:49.01]Ludwig, why are you, he knows you're not, he's not going to try to, you're not going to try to help him.
[35:52.41]I want low here.
[35:53.84]Do I want low?
[35:54.94]It's always been me and you, baby.
[35:56.14]It's always been me and you.
[35:58.32]I'm going to go with six.
[35:59.92]Number six.
[36:04.58]25 points, not bad.
[36:05.74]That's high.
[36:06.64]Not bad, Jerma.
[36:07.42]I'm cringing.
[36:07.98]You know, Jerma, you're in an interesting position because even if you get it right or wrong, you're still really in the game here.
[36:14.26]But it would really help to get that 25-point boost.
[36:16.84]You may be able to put it away here, Jerma.
[36:22.18]Alright.
[36:23.78]All you got to do, Jerma, is tell me whether these snap-in store containers
[36:32.69]Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher.
[36:35.61]Wait, wait, wait.
[36:36.71]What's the brand?
[36:37.27]What's the brand?
[36:37.71]It's generic.
[36:38.11]It's a Walmart brand.
[36:39.52]This is a generic brand.
[36:40.52]It looks like a Duane Reade.
[36:41.60]What's the brand?
[36:42.72]This is a up and up.
[36:45.54]Up and up.
[36:47.46]Up and up.
[36:47.82]Why are you guys helping each other?
[36:49.06]Up and up, go higher.
[36:50.00]Up and up, go higher.
[36:51.06]That's probably like $11.
[36:51.88]And that's more than $10.
[36:54.43]I know.
[36:55.07]Up and up.
[36:55.47]We're going to go up.
[36:56.41]Up and up.
[36:56.67]You're going to go up?
[36:57.11]Up and up.
[36:57.47]It's probably like $11.
[36:58.91]Jerma.
[37:00.27]Jerma, I respect the way you play this game, but that was an interesting decision because it's wrong!
[37:06.99]Minus 25 points, man.
[37:09.83]Jerma, back to you, sir.
[37:11.83]If I looked correctly when I cheated and saw number five, I think it was 20, which would give you enough to beat me up.
[37:17.38]Wait.
[37:19.20]Jerma, for the record, there's no way you could see behind that.
[37:21.06]Don't you forget, like, pulling it off earlier?
[37:23.00]No.
[37:23.34]Okay.
[37:25.14]I don't think I remember.
[37:27.84]Nice turtleneck, loser.
[37:30.34]am I a loser no no no no sorry I'm I'm gay I can say these things we're gonna go with alright Jerma what do you think we're gonna go number one come on because that was number one here we go yes that's enough for first wait are you guys on the same team I'm very confused no
[37:53.29]Jerma, you need to tell me whether this dog toy costs more or less than this baseball bat and ball.
[38:00.57]I know this.
[38:01.31]My dogs only have bark.
[38:02.75]Tell them what it is.
[38:03.35]Oh, I thought it was because it said double stuffed on it.
[38:05.71]Take a look.
[38:07.09]You can even squeeze.
[38:08.01]Let's see.
[38:08.59]Not even in the game.
[38:14.14]Does it open?
[38:15.52]I think it opens.
[38:19.36]Oh, my heavens.
[38:22.42]I GOT TO Google WHY THAT FEELS GOOD.
[38:25.76]OH, MY GOD, IT'S PROBABLY $9 AND I'M GOING TO FREAK OUT.
[38:30.19]A LOT OF POINTS ON THE LINE HERE, Jerma.
[38:31.79]WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?
[38:32.89]IT'S HIGHER.
[38:36.51]Jerma, IF YOU GET THIS WRONG, YOU'RE PROBABLY OUT OF THE GAME WITH 20 POINTS DOWN.
[38:41.60]REALLY SEPARATE YOUR VIEW.
[38:42.62]BUT Jerma, LET'S GET A SHOT OF Jerma HERE.
[38:45.68]HE'S EVEN TURNED AROUND FROM HIS PODIUM.
[38:47.78]Jerma, YOU ARE CORRECT!
[38:54.97]11.99 was the cost of the dog toy, bringing your point total to 187, taking a narrow lead.
[39:00.87]Jerma has 187 points.
[39:03.37]Mia has 185 points.
[39:05.55]Oh, goodness.
[39:06.45]Jerma, since you're in the lead, I'm going to flip the tables here, let you pick the number that you would like to first.
[39:12.54]Whoa.
[39:13.50]Or you can let her go first.
[39:14.52]Whoa.
[39:16.38]I don't know why you would let her go first.
[39:18.88]Ladies first.
[39:20.30]Jerma?
[39:20.78]Do you want to win a gentleman or die a loser?
[39:25.60]Yeah, Jerma.
[39:26.82]Never mind.
[39:27.29]She's being snarky.
[39:28.15]Take it back.
[39:28.61]Take it back from her.
[39:29.65]Take what's ours.
[39:30.75]Four plus seven is seven.
[39:32.05]Four plus three is seven.
[39:33.05]That's lucky seven.
[39:35.17]So I definitely wouldn't want to go first because I would want to... Hold on.
[39:37.89]Four plus seven is seven.
[39:40.47]You can go first.
[39:42.23]Go math, please.
[39:43.21]Four plus three is seven.
[39:45.03]Four.
[39:45.33]Number four.
[39:46.03]That is exactly what I wanted.
[39:47.29]I was laughing.
[39:47.79]How do you know?
[39:48.45]That is exactly what I wanted.
[39:51.19]And you're going to get it wrong.
[39:51.87]And you're going to get it wrong.
[39:52.87]And you're going to get it wrong.
[39:54.69]Oh, my lord have mercy.
[39:56.01]Can we show what three is right now for the drama?
[39:58.29]What's three?
[39:58.79]What's three?
[39:59.13]We're going to do it all, and then we're going to reveal who got it right and wrong.
[40:02.07]Oh.
[40:02.37]Alright.
[40:03.17]Jerma, let's see what is behind three.
[40:06.74]Jerma, 30 points.
[40:08.06]Oh, they're close.
[40:09.80]OK, so this is the situation.
[40:11.76]Basically, if both of you get it right, Mia's going to take home the cake.
[40:16.92]If you both get it wrong, Mia's gonna take home the cake.
[40:19.70]No, because she loses 45.
[40:20.62]Oh, no, you're right.
[40:21.50]If you both get it wrong, Jerma's gonna take home the cake.
[40:25.16]Tell me, Mia, right here, if this package of microfiber cloths costs more or less than this baseball and bat.
[40:34.46]Let me hold it.
[40:34.92]Which is $10, okay?
[40:35.84]I've never even heard of this brand.
[40:38.34]Okay.
[40:39.94]It's because you have a house cleaner, Mia.
[40:41.38]Of course you've never... Don't talk about me like that.
[40:44.80]So if she gets this right, it's over.
[40:47.97]Well, he won't tell you, right?
[40:49.07]I won't tell you.
[40:49.99]Less.
[40:50.57]Less.
[40:50.77]You think it's less.
[40:51.47]Yeah.
[40:52.39]Jerma.
[40:53.57]Yes.
[40:55.25]Does this downy in-wash booster beads... Does this cost more or less than this baseball bat and ball?
[41:10.25]Yes.
[41:11.75]What?
[41:12.15]100%.
[41:12.17]Yeah, I'm going to agree with it.
[41:13.81]More or less?
[41:14.87]Way more.
[41:15.41]You think this costs way more?
[41:16.43]Way more.
[41:16.91]Yeah.
[41:17.05]It's pretty smart.
[41:18.15]Good answer.
[41:18.77]Good answer.
[41:19.77]Way more.
[41:20.39]Alright.
[41:21.55]She guessed that these microfiber rags, or cloths, excuse me, were worth less than this baseball bat and ball.
[41:31.84]There's no way they're more.
[41:34.48]Jerma guessed that these downy in-wash booster beads
[41:40.46]are worth more than this baseball bat and ball.
[41:45.90]Let me tell you something, folks.
[41:48.75]Only one of you is correct.
[41:50.75]Whoa, whoa.
[41:54.05]But who is it?
[41:54.63]You should do Jerma first, because it doesn't matter.
[42:00.27]Just say who wins first, and then you can say.
[42:03.89]I don't know what you're going to do.
[42:05.46]It's just scary, though.
[42:06.90]I don't know.
[42:07.24]Is this the most intense music we have?
[42:09.85]You're giving me anxiety.
[42:10.85]Add lightning.
[42:11.53]This is actually quite scary.
[42:12.91]Lightning.
[42:13.53]Oh, Fernandez.
[42:14.87]We got high hats now.
[42:16.25]Oh, shit.
[42:16.47]We're grooving.
[42:17.53]If Jerma and Mia both got it wrong, Ludwig, you could have won.
[42:21.66]Oh, that's true.
[42:22.66]You said that there was no way mathematically that he could have.
[42:25.66]So you called me a loser for like five minutes with a buzzer for nothing?
[42:28.70]But that didn't happen because you're still a loser.
[42:36.19]Do it again.
[42:39.79]If you want to throw these.
[42:40.61]Okay, Ferdinand, back to the other one.
[42:41.87]If you weren't gay, you'd be homophobic.
[42:42.97]Oh, that's true.
[42:44.58]Well, yes, I'd be cancer by now.
[42:46.94]The winner of Name Your Price between Jerma and Mia is...
[43:02.20]Congratulations!
[43:04.94]The microfiber rags cost more than the baseball bat and ball at $14.59.
[43:10.27]I was thinking $3.
[43:14.05]These cost more than the baseball bat and ball at $12.99.
[43:19.33]Ladies and gentlemen, what a fabulous episode, and name your prize!
[43:24.55]Let's get the lights up on the contestants here, folks, and give it up for them.
[43:29.01]Round of applause.
[43:29.93]Let's give a big round of applause.
[43:32.53]How much money?
[43:33.45]How much money is this?
[43:35.43]$19.87.
[43:35.61]Alright.
[43:36.77]Yeah.
[43:37.43]That's amazing.
[43:40.77]Look at that.
