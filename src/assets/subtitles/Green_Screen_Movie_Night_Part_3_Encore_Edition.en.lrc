[00:07.64]I should have it ready to go.
[00:08.56]Alright, so this is, like I said, a compilation of videos that have been submitted, and they have been viewed, and they have not been bought by me.
[00:28.89]So it's still a surprise, so don't worry.
[00:32.53]There are 55 videos
[00:37.15]We're going to watch them all.
[00:40.79]I'm going to change the title to Just Brain Screen Encore Night.
[00:46.49]Hopefully Cox behaves.
[00:49.15]Because it looks like it's trying to not behave.
[00:50.95]Let me go like this.
[00:54.51]Alright.
[00:56.21]I believe we are ready.
[01:02.56]Here comes a Windows sound.

[01:07.83]Are you ready?
[01:11.22]55 downloads.
[01:17.02]Welcome to the Green Screen Encore movie experience.
[01:21.56]It should take us about an hour to an hour and a half maybe plus to get through all these.
[01:27.41]Go to like the just chatting section because that's kind of just what we're doing.
[01:31.85]We're just hanging out.
[01:37.82]And here we go.
[01:39.56]This first one is called Slap Tales.
[01:44.30]Slap Tales.
[01:44.90]Let me make sure you can hear it.
[01:47.36]Yes, you can.
[01:49.95]Let's turn this shit up, though.
[01:51.79]Slap Tales.
[02:02.73]How's that sound?

[03:55.72]When Chef Ramsay went into the men's bathroom, can't believe it, he saw something he would never see in his entire life.
[04:03.68]You have bleach inside of the sink.
[04:06.94]How will the blue team be able to recover from this?
[04:09.87]Will the red team capitalize in the women's bathroom?
[04:13.65]I just... I couldn't believe it.
[04:16.07]She actually was trying to hurt me.
[04:18.33]There's a shotgun in the fucking bathroom.
[04:20.72]Let's tune in next time.
[04:23.94]The fuck is happening?
[04:26.44]With Gordon Ramsay.
[04:29.92]Activate windows.
[04:33.58]You're using like a bootleg copy of Windows?

[08:06.21]I'm like cross-eyed.
[08:08.03]What's going on here?
[08:10.21]Did you do this to me or did I actually look like this?
[08:15.54]One eye is going this way, the other eye is going the complete opposite direction.
[08:23.30]Oh man, that was fucking hilarious.
[08:25.10]Alright, moving on.
[08:27.82]Here comes the next one.

[11:42.49]It's gonna be burned in my brain.
[11:45.49]I'm gonna see these images in my head.
[12:19.63]That's a great song.
[12:20.43]Come on, Anakin.
[12:24.19]I have the high ground.
[12:25.19]It's easy for you to say.
[12:26.57]You're an evil Sith.
[12:29.27]Don't try it.
[12:32.25]I'll let you die.

[13:49.79]Plus, the new story I'm writing is here.

[14:27.09]I don't know.
[14:29.03]First one I found dates back to the 60s.
[14:30.63]The only link between all these cases is the symbol.
[14:36.50]The symbol is associated with a pagan deity named Bagul.
[14:40.70]He consumes the souls of human children.
[14:49.40]I have never been onto something this big before.
[14:56.38]actually lived in the images themselves and that they were gateways into his realm.

[76:35.64]That's the broken bone!
[76:56.73]My favorite part is, like I said before, the into the stomach puke.
[77:02.57]I got hit during that green screen when I was in front of it.
[77:08.13]I took like, in the shoulder, in the back, like 10 different injuries into the stomach.
[77:14.84]But everybody just uses the puke and I think that's, I love that.
[77:19.52]Because there's so many other options.
[77:22.70]Do we already see this one?
[77:23.92]I don't remember.
[77:25.56]This Jerm is in the kitchen.

[78:45.10]I want to show you something that I care about.
[78:47.84]Something that I want to show.

[92:27.68]Well, you know what they say.
[92:30.38]Smoke them if you got them.

[95:56.42]And what will it mean for the wider region?
[95:59.36]I think one of your children has just walked in.
[96:00.76]I mean, shifting sands in the region, do you think relations with the North may change?
[96:07.42]I would be surprised if they do.

[103:07.97]They're already here.
[103:10.59]The Elder Scrolls told of their return.
[103:15.86]Their defeat was merely a delay.
[103:21.03]To the time after Oblivion opened.
[103:26.71]When the Sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.
[103:30.01]But no one wanted to believe.
[103:40.59]Believe they even existed.
[103:43.71]And when the truth finally dawns, it dawns in fire.
[103:56.05]But there's one they fear.
[104:00.63]In their tongue is Dovahkiin, Dragonborn.
[104:08.92]Absolutely terrible.
[104:09.42]Eat your vegetables and fruits too.
[104:42.15]This is opportunity knocking.
[104:46.15]You know, the closer you get to them, the more you become a target.
[104:49.93]The closer I get, the better chance we have to stop them.
[104:52.53]You're a scientist.
[104:53.95]I've ordered Silver Sable and her team to shoot you on sight.
[105:00.85]These cities had enough of your vigilante.
[105:07.91]Come on, Peter.
[105:23.75]I'm something of a scientist myself.
[105:26.21]It's time for you to pay!
[105:28.13]Oh my god.
[105:31.01]Ugh.
[105:34.16]So why do good girls like bad guys?
[105:38.14]I had this question for a real long time.
[105:41.19]I've been a bad boy and it's plain to see.
[105:44.83]So why do good girls fall in love with me?
[106:22.46]I see it I'm gonna die that's me getting killed
[107:06.92]It's like, imagine being that bad with a lightsaber, you die instantly.
[107:11.91]You wouldn't even get it out of the academy.
[107:14.73]Oh no.
[107:54.07]Oh shit, Scream's hacked.
[108:30.14]Yeah, yeah.
[108:35.19]They're going as a roll.
[109:23.60]I'm just shitting my pants!
[109:55.15]air long ago the four nations lived together in harmony then everything changed when the fire nation attacked
[110:28.11]What the fuck is that?
[110:31.29]That was great.
[110:53.08]Oh, the emote!
[110:53.68]That's cool.
[110:56.10]So that was all Kiwo, by the way, until we just got to the next one here.
[111:23.98]I'm trying not to just, like, be a cackling psycho over these, so I'm muting sometimes.
[111:29.60]Oh, man.
[111:32.34]I think we're getting close to the end, though.
[111:39.05]Don't mute, don't mute.
[111:40.25]Well, I haven't been muting that much.
[111:47.23]But yeah, that was all Kewo.
[111:49.79]So I think we only have a handful more, like five or six more, maybe.
[111:52.94]I'm not sure.
[111:56.23]But here we go, this is Ultra Compact Dream Streamer.
[111:59.49]Yeah.
[112:23.97]This is really good.
[112:25.77]This is really good.
[112:26.58]This is New York.
[112:27.42]Peter in New York City, but 50% of its population is Jermos.
[112:31.22]Oh god.
[112:51.39]Peter, I hear you like a scientist.
[112:54.16]Well, I'm something of a scientist, by the way.
[113:18.66]Ugh.
[113:47.75]my face.
[113:50.47]Why are we all psychos?
[113:51.85]Why are we all like fucking NPCs with like our aggression turned up to 100?
[113:56.09]I need to see this one again.
[114:06.25]Why?
[114:06.49]Like there's one of them hiding behind the taxi?
[114:10.09]Holy shit, that was fucking funny.
[114:13.11]Again.
[114:19.86]Peter, I hear you like a scientist.
[114:22.60]Well, I'm something of a scientist, by the way.
[114:29.27]That's my guy right there.
[114:32.51]That's my guy right there.
[114:34.11]Why would you hide?
[114:46.29]We're also like fucked up I didn't want to knock you up
[115:12.59]Why would they be in a fight?
[115:15.57]There's no reason.
[115:16.61]They didn't do anything.
[115:19.93]Hold on.
[115:21.11]Oh.
[115:42.94]Jesus Christ.
[115:45.96]My fucking head is killing me right now.
[115:48.43]Hold on.
[115:50.07]Give me one second.
[115:51.64]Ugh.
[116:15.06]Okay.
[116:15.98]I'm back.
[116:18.18]Holy shit.
[116:21.98]It's just... This is perfect.
[116:27.95]I think we're at the end.
[116:31.27]Here comes the... I think this is the last video on the list.
[116:40.01]End of the movie night voice.
[116:44.17]Ugh.
[116:46.93]This is number 56 or 57, I think.
[116:49.65]So here we go.
[116:58.00]Happy eighth anniversary.
[117:02.02]It's been eight years.
[118:09.43]What e-vote is that?
[118:10.80]Oh, that's... Is that Mars?
[118:12.04]No.
[118:12.32]We are the Rex.
[118:13.66]We are the Rex.
[118:14.38]We are the Rex.
[118:14.82]We are the Rex.
[118:16.70]We are the Rex.
[118:53.56]Thank you for that.
[118:56.62]My God.
[119:01.10]It's my pleasure.
[119:03.80]It's been an eventful eight years.
[119:11.29]And that is going to take us to the end.
[119:14.71]We'll get a shitload of community subs that are coming in.
[119:17.63]Bingo Sunshine, thanks for five.
[119:18.99]Great Canadian Frick Club, thanks for ten.
[119:21.31]Gnarly, thanks for five.
[119:25.94]Oh, man.
[119:34.03]That was the encore presentation of green screen footage.
[119:43.06]Oh, man.
[119:43.66]I'm like a broken record now.
[119:46.18]Oh, man.
[119:46.76]Oh, geez.
[119:47.42]Oh, man.
[119:49.22]My head is fucking flying around in circles right now.
[119:55.12]Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs.
[119:57.94]And yeah, it actually, like last week or something, was eight years on Twitch and YouTube combined.
[120:04.94]It's been a long time.
[120:05.64]I want to just thank everybody for all the awesome shit that they made.
[120:10.18]If your video didn't make it through, that doesn't mean it wasn't any good.
[120:12.84]I just wanted to condense this down to like a couple hours.
[120:16.82]Like one to two hours.
[120:21.79]So the playlist, I think, let me make sure there's that.
[120:25.23]There might be one, there might be another one.
[120:26.83]Let me see.
[120:28.50]Let's just check the playlist to see just in case something was added.
[120:32.80]No, that's it.
[120:35.86]So I got the playlist.
[120:38.70]It will be publiced.
[120:39.98]It's not going to be unlisted.
[120:41.72]Grump is publicing this right now.
[120:45.38]Here is the playlist if you'd like to watch everything that was there.
[120:50.95]You guys surprise me every single day with your creativity and how fucking funny and interesting the shit you put together is.
[121:01.60]All I could do this stream is just enjoy it.
[121:04.80]So, thank you for all these awesome videos.
[121:07.92]And thanks for participating.
[121:09.71]Here is a link to the playlist.
[121:14.37]That is the current playlist.
[121:17.95]55 videos, it's about an hour and 20 minutes.
[121:20.51]Hour and 10 minutes or so.
[121:27.65]So I am going to... I'm probably going to call it early because I have seriously like slapped myself into like an even worse headache than I had like an hour ago.
[121:39.84]So I'm probably going to have to call it early.
[121:43.92]But...
[121:48.34]What's today?
[121:48.80]Today is Saturday.
[121:51.20]I will see you guys... Let me see here.
[121:59.01]Today is Saturday.
[122:00.15]I got some work to do on the carnival.
[122:02.27]So I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[122:03.75]We'll do Tuesday.
[122:04.49]I am like... My like sensory overload here is... That last New York City one.
[122:14.64]Holy shit.
[122:15.20]I almost died.
[122:18.04]The what?
[122:18.52]Oh, if you don't know, I'll be talking about it a lot more over the next few weeks, but there's going to be a Twitch-controlled robot carnival stream that is going to be on this stream within the next couple months.
[122:30.07]And I kind of have to dial back streams to work on it, so... Should be a lot of fun.
[122:36.31]So I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[122:37.51]I'm going to just take a quick break.
[122:38.55]I'm going to grab a water, and we'll come back and do the bits and the subs and everything.
[122:44.28]But thank you so much for being part of this community.
[122:47.48]And if you just watch, if you make this kind of shit, thank you.
[122:51.61]I love every second of it.
[122:52.75]So I will be right back.
[122:57.15]I'm going to like throw some water in my face.
[123:00.61]And we'll continue for another like probably 20, 30 minutes.
[123:02.81]I'll be right back.
[124:52.09]Okay, I am back.
[124:59.68]Let us get to the end here.
[125:05.20]Stream is over.
[125:07.20]Well, kind of.
[125:10.20]Let's do the bits.
[125:11.04]I also want to do the credits, too.
[125:13.96]We had a shitload of community subs tonight.
[125:16.75]Like, so many.
[125:18.09]Like, more than at least a few hundred, probably.
[125:21.01]At least 200-300 subs tonight, so... That's a fucking entire... Like... Baseball stadium full of people.
[125:29.43]Well, I mean, not really.
[125:30.89]If there was 200 people at a baseball game, it would probably be... Well, whatever.
[125:34.55]It's our baseball stadium.
[125:42.23]That's a Little League stadium.
[125:43.72]Yeah, if 250 people showed up to a Little League game... Wow, that's huge.
[125:48.92]Ugh.
[125:53.17]But thanks again, regardless, everybody.
[125:55.87]All the community subs.
[125:56.61]Let's go back to earlier today.
[126:01.10]We had TrustNoOne.
[126:04.04]Gave $2.50.
[126:04.28]Awesome, awesome job, TrustNoOne.
[126:13.46]It was a hell of a job.
[126:14.94]They say, the movie night is finally over, but my green screen videos playlist is not.
[126:20.26]After a rich dinner, let's have some sweet desserts.
[126:23.52]It will last less than 10 minutes.
[126:25.25]Don't worry.
[126:26.75]Love to you, Dad.
[126:27.97]Love to chat.
[126:30.35]Green screen movie encore night desserts.
[126:40.12]We got desserts?
[126:47.26]Oh man, we've got some desserts.
[126:52.31]Okay.
[127:03.69]This is Trust No One.
[127:06.11]Made of that insanely awesome 9 minute full short movie.
[127:14.48]We're gonna get the after credits scene here then.
[127:21.01]Why not, right?
[127:23.18]I'm going to get it on the screen.
[127:26.30]Here are the desserts.
[127:30.14]These are all by Trust No One.
[127:31.88]Less than 10 minutes or so here.
[127:35.68]We will continue with the bits after this, but this is truly, like, I mean, if we're here, let's do it.
[127:50.29]I just need to make this bigger.
[127:51.63]And... Here we go.
[127:57.22]This is chat.
[127:58.26]Jerma's chat during a stream.
[128:03.39]I will link this playlist as well.
[128:22.95]These were the final levels.
[128:28.34]Oh, what?
[128:31.26]Good, good.
[128:35.10]Kill him.
[128:36.42]What?
[128:37.96]Kill him now.
[128:39.78]What the fuck?
[128:42.41]Do it.
[128:48.99]Please welcome, the guy who will finally beat Team 17-1 on stream!
[129:09.13]That's true.
[129:09.79]Life is pain!
[129:14.40]Jeremah's tie issue.
[129:18.76]I don't fucking care about this tie.
[129:35.25]Ow!
[129:35.37]My head.
[129:46.44]I'm a scat man.
[130:22.45]Zap.
[130:22.53]You got something to say?
[130:25.05]Oh, murder me!
[130:34.20]Murder me!
[130:36.94]Murder me!
[130:37.36]Murder me!
[130:39.80]Wait, it's a spoiler!
[130:41.32]It's a spoiler incoming!
[130:43.98]It's possible spoiler alert!
[130:47.05]For I don't know what movie.
[130:48.49]They've made like 16 of these.
[130:50.71]I don't know which one.
[130:52.63]Just be ready.
[131:21.72]Bugs Bungie Special.
[131:26.52]You really fucking watching this shit?
[131:33.89]Please.
[131:34.33]Oh my god.
[131:37.49]Fuck you.
[132:14.67]Wait, this is interview... Jerma 2019... Jerma 2019 interviewing Jerma 2017.
[132:23.59]What is this?
[132:31.99]Excuse me, excuse me, like Walgreens.
[132:33.99]Are you here for the interview?
[132:38.19]No, just sit down, sit down, sit down, absolutely.
[132:41.36]What's your name?
[132:42.68]Chairman 985.
[132:44.39]Oh, I was looking at your resume.
[132:46.23]I had a good resume.
[132:48.25]It looks like you've got some.
[132:50.07]Content creator on YouTube.com with over 700,000 subscribers and over 1,000 videos made.
[132:57.38]Unbelievable.
[132:58.14]That's really, really great.
[132:59.34]Well, you know.
[133:01.44]Okay.
[133:01.82]Alright.
[133:02.82]So what is it about this company that you think that you can add, you know, some worth to?
[133:10.77]I can do this.
[133:13.78]You can do this.
[133:16.99]Do this.
[133:19.37]Right.
[133:21.17]Okay.
[133:27.33]Okay.
[133:27.45]Well, we're going to need a lot of that.
[133:29.33]So it's really, really important that you understand.
[133:31.97]I need valuable team members and well, I can do this.
[133:37.04]What's that?
[133:38.14]I can fucking count to 10.
[133:43.46]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[133:49.84]OK.
[133:50.50]Well, I don't think the position is for you.
[133:53.06]The position already has been filled.
[133:54.92]So what can you do?
[133:57.96]Just so you know who you're dealing with.
[134:05.53]Nobody used any of that.
[134:08.37]That's the only one that used guy at desk interviewing somebody.
[134:18.04]I sat there on January 1st and I did like five of those.
[134:22.32]This is back to formula.
[134:29.56]Who is this?
[134:45.93]Is this me?
[135:06.67]What?
[135:07.27]Check this out.
[135:08.03]Why don't you do all the filming for us while I run the branch?
[135:11.47]I'm going to give you this camera, but first let me just say... Ooh, I got it.
[135:14.79]Number one, don't talk... Alright, I'm getting the hang of it.
[135:21.47]Like, this guy sucks.
[135:22.91]Hey, it's time to play Dark Souls Remastered.
[135:33.23]What do you guys say?
[135:34.72]You ready?
[135:41.03]No, no, no, no.
[135:43.25]Damn it.
[135:43.81]There it is.
[135:44.55]Oh, I'm fucking dead.
[135:46.89]Oh my God.
[135:47.57]This guy is horrible.
[135:56.04]What about peppers and cheese?
[135:58.24]Is that going to work?
[136:04.61]Absolutely terrible.
[136:07.25]Nothing about this is good.
[136:08.55]Not one thing.
[136:10.51]God, I hate this.
[136:11.69]I hate this.
[136:12.43]This is terrible.
[136:13.23]This, by far, is absolute perfection.
[136:36.00]Boomer!
[136:36.84]Boomer!
[136:38.36]Boomer!
[136:40.22]Boomer!
[136:41.16]We got a boomer!
[136:47.61]I can't even keep up, man.
[136:50.05]Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
[136:52.41]I'm going to pick Jeremy.
[136:55.25]I'm going to beat this little shit.
[136:57.25]Oh, fuck.
[136:58.21]Now that's a...
[137:04.49]Oh boy.
[137:05.03]It is time to say those eight magic words.
[137:08.17]I am not smarter than a fifth grader.
[137:11.31]Hey, it's Jerma from Jerma985, and you're watching...
[137:40.89]Wait, is this implying that, like, my channel sucks?
[137:54.15]Hi, Squash.
[137:55.46]Oh, hi.
[137:57.22]What are you playing as?
[137:58.86]I'm playing as... What are you playing as?
[138:01.12]I'm going to be playing Team Fortress 2 as... Woohoo!
[138:05.78]Hey!
[138:06.24]I have it all for you!
[138:14.36]But I like that!
[138:16.88]Sign out!
[138:19.45]What?
[138:22.19]I don't- what?
[138:23.29]What the fuck?
[138:24.49]I don't- what?
[138:25.11]Why do I have to delete system 32?
[138:47.95]Well, that was Trust No One's playlist of desserts.
[138:51.91]Those were fucking great.
[138:57.17]No, I know that that was a watcher watching me.
[138:59.73]That was a chatter.
[139:02.07]But, like, I'm pretending to be that chatter.
[139:03.91]Like, why would I delete?
[139:04.69]Why would I need to do that?
[139:05.91]It's my motivation of being a chatter in the chat, you know?
[139:11.67]But, let's go back to saying goodnight.
[139:15.55]Trust no one.
[139:16.25]Again, great ship.
[139:18.07]Awesome.
[139:20.21]You knocked it out of the park.
[139:23.53]I feel like I've exhaled, like, like probably 30 to 40 times tonight.
[139:40.74]I've done the get... I've been seated for so long as a 75 year old man.
[139:47.72]And that's the noise that you make when you get up after about an hour of sitting done.
[139:55.95]That was fucking awesome.
[140:01.15]But let's get back to the bits.
[140:04.11]Good shit as always.
[140:08.42]We also had...
[140:10.62]Too many community subs to even count.
[140:13.74]Like I said earlier.
[140:15.82]Thank you, everybody.
[140:18.00]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $2.50.
[140:19.74]I swear, Jeremy, if there's a single JoJo dance meme in the playlist, I will unsub and sue you.
[140:25.71]Also, can you show Otto?
[140:27.61]Otto's currently downstairs.
[140:31.87]But I'm sorry that you have to unsubscribe.
[140:35.45]I'm really sorry about that.
[140:36.90]But there was at least one JoJo dance clip.
[140:47.81]Thank you, Peaceful Hayley, for the 250.
[140:51.53]Hey, Jeremy, I don't really watch your streams that much anymore.
[140:53.88]I'm sorry.
[140:54.94]But I'd like to stop in from time to time to donate.
[140:57.10]And finally, I got some voiceover gigs.
[141:00.08]It's nothing fancy, just reading articles and something for e-learning.
[141:03.30]But I'm so happy I finally got something.
[141:05.56]And there's even more gigs to come.
[141:07.62]Can't wait for whatever's in store.
[141:09.79]Anyways, hope you enjoy playing this baby game.
[141:11.99]Mario is not a baby game.
[141:13.17]It's not a game for adults.
[141:14.13]It's a game for an adult.
[141:17.63]But it's good to hear.
[141:18.27]Awesome.
[141:21.41]Keep chipping at it.
[141:24.70]Thank you so much for the $2.50s.
[141:25.96]Thanks for stopping by.
[141:30.58]Happy to have you whenever you end up dropping by to say hello.
[141:34.80]And good luck.
[141:36.15]Hopefully you get some more stuff going on.
[141:41.57]A Mr. Comcast gave $5 earlier.
[141:44.01]Hey, Jerma, John Comcast here.
[141:46.55]Been sitting alone in my shitty rip-off version of the Batcave, the Comcave.
[141:50.67]You know, because I'm rich.
[141:53.12]But I've been very lonely without you.
[141:54.80]Going away for a week.
[141:55.78]Disgraceful.
[141:57.10]Anyway, I filed, uh, filled that time with writing short stories about you.
[142:03.06]I hope you enjoy.
[142:03.82]Um...
[142:08.91]Yeah, this is like three pages long.
[142:13.75]Yeah, I used to know jermaOn 8-5.
[142:15.30]We go way back, further than I can remember.
[142:17.50]Back in those days, he was a somewhat normal functioning member of society.
[142:20.90]We'd hang around bingo halls, giving high fives to old ladies as they left.
[142:25.04]We'd go to see movies and eat food at places that sell food.
[142:27.96]Sometimes we'd even go and eat food at the movies.
[142:30.37]Life was great, tranquil, perfect.
[142:32.91]It didn't last.
[142:33.53]Nothing good lasts forever.
[142:36.27]I noticed the change somewhere around 2010.
[142:40.27]Instead of hanging out, he'd want to stay in.
[142:42.32]We grew distant around that time.
[142:44.54]If I only knew back then what I know now, I'd have to try harder to get him to talk to save him, but I was foolish.
[142:51.88]Hanging out with Jerma became stranger.
[142:53.56]It started somewhat innocent.
[142:55.73]He'd go up to people, put on dumb voices, say dumb things.
[142:58.63]But that was mostly the extent of it.
[143:00.65]It got worse as time went on, though.
[143:02.19]He went from putting on voices to actually being the characters of the voices he did.
[143:07.87]He'd hide in my closet pretending to be a crazy old grandpa, mocking me for being bad at Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
[143:15.47]His words hurt, but not long after his fist did too.
[143:34.05]Thank you for the five dollars, Mr. Comcast.
[143:36.31]Thanks for the story that this creative writing assignment that you've given yourself.
[143:51.14]Okay.
[143:52.64]If you'd like to read more, you can read more at your own pace.
[144:02.05]Did I cut off my own mic?
[144:03.25]No, I cut off my own throat.
[144:05.57]I mean, I cut off my own... I... I silenced myself.
[144:16.29]I stopped talking, is what I... Ah!
[144:18.47]Ah!
[144:19.85]Ah!
[144:20.57]Ah!
[144:25.03]Thank you, oh my god, Taeyeon, for the 250.
[144:28.07]Great stream today, Jerma.
[144:29.35]Can't wait for the 20 second Switch Block Blast stream tomorrow.
[144:35.88]Fourth consecutive line, thanks for the five bucks.
[144:37.60]It's okay, Jerma, you're the world record holder in our hearts.
[144:41.60]Aw, hey, thank you.
[144:44.16]Thank you.
[144:49.10]That means a lot.
[144:51.67]I'm not even going to read that out loud.
[144:52.61]But thank you for the $2.50.
[144:53.21]I really appreciate it.
[144:53.93]Thank you, Sir Rock.
[145:18.00]Also, DrewWord, thanks for the $3.10.
[145:21.83]Nice driving world record in my book.
[145:28.41]Thank you.
[145:32.87]Thank you, DrewWord.
[145:35.99]We also had, not that long ago, we had TwitchChatMain gave $5.00.
[145:44.15]PogChamped all over my pants.
[145:50.22]You shit your pants?
[145:51.36]What's that mean?
[145:57.38]But thank you.
[146:00.46]I hope he cleaned up.
[146:03.62]Seas of the Roman, thanks for the five dollars.
[146:05.99]Any gifters in chat?
[146:08.47]Any oil princes?
[146:09.45]Any hedge fund managers?
[146:11.45]Any tiger owners?
[146:14.29]Any oil princes?
[146:16.87]Oh, this is during the insane sub blast that we got.
[146:21.08]Me, me, me.
[146:27.03]Thank you to Avery Dropped Dead for the $10.
[146:33.31]No, it's not much, but I just want to show support to my favorite streamer.
[146:37.57]Well, thank you.
[146:39.15]You got me out of a rough place a couple years ago in the laughs.
[146:41.49]You gave me a priceless.
[146:43.37]Thank you for being your wonderful self.
[146:46.79]I love you and trans rights.

[147:13.71]Thank you, PeacefulHaley.
[147:16.01]On top of your... donation from earlier.
[147:18.69]Thanks a lot.
[147:21.50]You're my favorite streamer.
[147:24.76]Thanks, guys.
[147:26.72]Hey, JermaHedgeFundManager here.
[147:28.00]I'd like to donate $100,000 to you, but I can only do so if you give me your Twitch username and password so I can deposit it in your account directly.
[147:34.76]I await your response.
[147:37.00]Oh.
[147:37.84]Yeah, okay.
[147:41.50]I mean, that makes sense, because how else would you be able to... How else would you do that, right?
[147:46.48]I think I get it.
[147:50.80]Because that's like a large amount of money I get.
[147:52.58]No, that makes sense.
[147:55.40]My username is obviously Jerma985.
[147:57.48]It's my username.
[147:58.86]It's what it is.
[148:01.02]And... My password... 2... 4.
[148:15.17]So... Did my stream cut out?
[148:17.59]I got a long password.
[148:18.55]It's like 600 characters.
[148:19.61]I think I got it all.
[148:22.97]What happened to the internet?
[148:24.85]No, I'm here.
[148:26.07]Did you get it?
[148:26.47]Yeah, it's like a 600 character password.
[148:35.46]I'll just, I'll send it to you.
[148:39.49]Thanks though.
[148:40.93]When should I expect the money?
[148:53.43]nine eight five two four two two four germinate five two four I can't believe it hey thank you too honey chain for the three bucks Jerma you have beautiful hair thank you I take very good care of it I wash it
[149:21.74]And I condition it.
[149:23.19]And I comb it.
[149:24.39]And I brush it.
[149:25.81]And I eat lots of vitamin E. And I eat lots of high fatty omega-3s to make sure it's luscious.
[149:33.03]I take care of it.
[149:33.67]I don't want to lose it.
[149:42.72]But thank you.
[149:43.70]For the $3.
[149:44.24]Another hungry hedgehog.
[149:47.61]Thanks for the $3.
[149:48.55]I can't stress enough how much I needed this tonight.
[149:50.29]Thanks.
[149:53.65]I'm glad you enjoyed it, because it's always a blast, it's always awesome.
[149:56.65]I just wanted to make sure, you know, months ago when I talked about doing this... I wanted to have enough time to go by, because this kind of shit is really overstimulating.
[150:10.70]So... I don't usually like to do the same thing twice.
[150:18.50]And if it's something that a lot of people really want, and enough time goes by, then we can kind of do it again.
[150:25.12]So definitely worth doing, for sure.
[150:27.24]Cyanide0 coming in with 10 community subs.
[150:30.06]Thank you, Cyanide.
[150:31.68]Lots of subs tonight.
[150:33.06]Wait till you see the credits roll by.
[150:38.65]It's like 300.
[150:43.43]But thank you.
[150:45.29]Really appreciate that.
[150:48.32]There was so... I think I missed community subs, too, just because there were so many in a row.
[150:52.42]But whoever you are, however much you gave, thanks.
[150:58.05]Really.
[151:03.63]Yeah, I'll be alright.
[151:08.67]I just... I had a headache last night.
[151:10.79]And I woke up with a migraine.
[151:14.17]And I knew that this was going to happen tonight, so I kind of was preparing for this to be a thing.
[151:23.77]But for sure.
[151:24.43]Yeah.
[151:27.75]Also, I missed from earlier, Never Trust a Purple Gate, $50.
[151:33.52]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[151:34.68]There was a huge amount of big donations that came in about 20 minutes ago.
[151:42.70]But Never Trust Purple get 50 bucks.
[151:44.26]Thank you so much, Purple.
[151:45.88]Been here for longer than I can remember, man.
[151:48.09]You've always had such a positive, positive impact on my life and so many others.
[151:51.71]Eight years of laughs and positivity.
[151:53.43]Keep it on, keep it on.
[151:57.03]I'm gonna try.
[151:57.51]There's lots of stuff that I still want to do.
[152:01.41]And I'm still trying to keep myself interested, so.
[152:05.99]We'll see at 10 years.
[152:09.71]That's gonna be so weird.
[152:17.92]10 straight years is coming up.
[152:19.38]Well, I mean, it's going to take like two years to do it, but still.
[152:26.13]Never thought I would be doing something like this for that long.
[152:29.16]So thank you guys.
[152:30.32]Thanks for watching.
[152:34.08]thank you purple for the 50 bucks thank you snoozing copter for the 250. wonderful second movie night love the talent and creativity this community offers even though it's a bunch of bad jokes sometimes I always think about all the things I want to write in a bit message but I end up not saying or asking any of the things I thought about anyway do you plan on playing viewer levels in Mario Maker because I made some yes
[152:58.77]I will actually do a proper Mario Maker stream.
[153:04.79]I just wanted to give some time a couple hours before the movie night.
[153:11.13]So we will do one.
[153:16.57]It'll be proper.
[153:19.06]Hopefully he didn't burn out by playing the expert levels.
[153:21.12]No, no, I was just... I was just tilting myself.
[153:25.06]So, don't worry.
[153:26.76]We will return to Mario Maker 2.
[153:29.79]Let's go, actually, let's think about next week here.
[153:31.75]So, Tuesday.
[153:32.97]You know what?
[153:36.89]Tuesday is probably a good day to do it because Wednesday and Thursday I want to do Dark Souls Randomizer.
[153:42.94]At least on Wednesday.
[153:44.38]So, Tuesday will be Mario Maker 2.
[153:48.78]Actual online levels, viewer levels.
[153:53.02]Wednesday will be Dark Souls Randomizer.
[153:56.20]Thursday, depending on how much fun I'm having in either one of those things, we might return to Cook, Serve, Delicious, or that item shop game.
[154:08.32]That's kind of the plan for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
[154:11.44]We'll see.
[154:17.96]That item shop game.
[154:19.35]Yeah, I can't say it.
[154:20.99]It's like Recettear or something.
[154:26.17]We'll see.
[154:30.15]Uh, thank you, Cripple Crusader, for the five dollars.
[154:32.73]It's been eight years.
[154:33.65]The time really flies when you're having fun.

[154:37.25]Thanks for the years of content.
[154:41.58]Thanks for the five bucks.
[154:44.18]That is how you say it.
[154:44.86]Oh, that's good.
[154:47.90]I got it right.
[154:50.64]Yeah, time does fly.
[154:51.50]As I get older, the clock seems to be in times two speed.
[155:02.64]But I'm having a great time.
[155:06.64]So, I cherish every moment here.
[155:11.59]Great Canadian Frick Club gave $100.

[155:51.66]I don't know who leaked this video, but I'm looking forward to the carnival stream.
[155:54.46]Who leaked this video?
[155:55.64]I don't know who leaked what.
[156:09.76]Well, I mean, we kind of have to watch this.
[156:17.76]Oh, shit.
[156:27.35]Interesting thought process.
[156:28.63]Oh, wait.
[156:29.15]Oh, fuck.

[159:14.12]Thank you, Razlik, for your five dollars.
[159:17.42]And the, uh, really nice, nice words.
[159:21.60]Look at that image.
[159:22.38]What image?
[159:22.86]That's scary.
[159:29.51]That is a creepy face.
[159:43.78]Jerm of Grin.
[159:46.90]That is a shit-eating grin.
[159:59.20]Maybe we'll add it to the list.
[160:04.38]Hey Tingy, thanks for the 250.
[160:06.52]Streams like these are so much fun.
[160:07.77]There are so many talented people in chat.

[160:50.08]You've been around for a long time, Purple, so thank you.
[160:57.00]Let's keep going, right?
[160:58.76]Let's keep trying new things.
[161:03.15]Couple more.
[161:03.55]Here we have Nickname Jack for the 250.
[161:05.88]Amazing encore.
[161:06.76]Thanks for the laughs tonight.
[161:08.58]So many talents in chat.
[161:10.30]Love you all.
[161:17.38]Thank you, Nickname Jack.
[161:22.05]Really appreciate it.
[161:24.35]Thank you, SirBlackMage, for the 250.
[161:26.33]Hey, Jermbo, EU pleb here.
[161:28.33]It's 4 a.m.
[161:29.27]in Austria, and I'm falling asleep at my desk.
[161:32.51]But it was worth staying up for this hysterical stream.
[161:35.01]Also been watching you since 2004 or something.
[161:42.55]That's a long fucking time!
[161:47.17]Back in 20- 2004!
[161:47.57]I don't think you noticed.
[161:55.98]Well, however long, that's a long time.
[162:00.81]Back in 1985.
[162:04.77]But hopefully you didn't have to stay up too late for this.
[162:08.45]SirBlackMage, thanks for the $2.50.
[162:10.71]Glad you enjoyed it.
[162:11.75]And thanks for watching for so damn long.
[162:13.83]That's a long time.
[162:17.62]Thank you.
[162:20.06]And then at the very end here, NicoCat gave $10 right at the very end.
[162:26.43]Hey Jerma, always enjoyed your stream.
[162:27.77]You're one of the best, most genuine streamers on the site.
[162:30.19]Gotta ask though, did you ever think you'd play Cave Story on stream?
[162:35.00]Interestingly enough, first of all, thank you.
[162:37.76]And secondly, I did.
[162:42.85]Anyone remember the old YouTube streams from 2012, 2013?
[162:46.49]I streamed Cave Story a few times.
[162:58.50]Those old YouTube streams from 2004.
[163:04.00]You did YouTube streams?
[163:05.32]Yeah, I did YouTube streams.
[163:08.04]But this is before YouTube gaming.
[163:10.00]This is years before that.
[163:13.62]Yeah, I streamed like Diablo 3.
[163:17.23]And a few other things.
[163:18.95]10 million.
[163:19.51]I remember those streams.
[163:20.23]I remember my power going out.
[163:21.33]I remember lightning struck a mile away from my house and turned off my entire street's power.
[163:32.06]I remember I didn't watch the TF2 streams because I was like gross live.
[163:36.98]Well, streaming wasn't really that popular back then either.
[163:40.72]Didn't really catch on until somewhere in... 2013?
[163:46.99]2012?
[163:50.61]But, that's my time.
[163:52.51]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[163:55.17]We will do some fun stuff.
[163:57.92]Have a wonderful rest of your weekend.
[163:59.62]Hope you enjoyed the encore.
[164:01.22]Thank you again to all the incredibly talented fucking people that made great shit.
[164:05.42]And thanks for sticking around and watching it.
[164:10.91]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[164:17.97]Good evening.
[164:18.43]Good evening.
[164:31.85]Hey, why is my stuff, why is my stuff broken?
[164:40.37]Who's streaming right now?
[164:41.25]We got Nova, we got Talon.
[164:43.44]What's Nova doing?
[164:46.10]Alright, Nova's playing Mario Maker 2.
[164:49.32]I wanna go, go see.
[164:54.73]I want you guys to prepare for my stream for Mario Maker 2.
[165:04.10]It's been a long time since we've said hello to James, so... Like, it's more than a few months.
[165:10.41]And he's playing Mario Maker 2, so it's pretty relevant right now.
[165:25.35]I'll say hello.
[165:38.19]What's our battle cry?
[165:39.21]Um.
[165:43.07]Sup.
[165:45.83]Say.
[165:46.71]Sup.
[165:48.11]And I want you to pay attention to how good Nova is at this game.
[165:51.47]Because you need to be ready to watch me.
[165:55.02]He ain't gonna get a world record on a speedrun.
[165:56.68]Here we go.
[166:12.23]Are we ready?
[166:12.63]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[166:16.51]Take care.
[166:19.46]Much love to you.
[166:23.66]Have a great night.
[166:41.13]Thank you.
