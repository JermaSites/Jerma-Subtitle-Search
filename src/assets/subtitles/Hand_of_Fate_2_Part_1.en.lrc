[00:31.35]Ayyyy, it's-a me, Fonzie!
[00:34.25]It's-a me, Fonzie!
[00:36.75]That's not how he does it, but something like that.
[00:38.78]Hi, guys.
[00:41.08]How are you?
[00:44.50]No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:45.86]I, like, just... I just turned on the stream.
[00:50.32]I need to wait.
[00:51.30]I'm gonna redo my hellos.
[00:54.62]And intros.
[00:56.94]Like, nobody even, like, got here yet.
[00:58.66]Wait.
[01:00.70]Pretend like you've been watching this screen for a little while.
[01:03.43]I'll be right back.
[01:04.75]Hold on.
[01:50.90]Hey, what's up everybody?
[01:52.40]How are you?
[01:53.84]Welcome to the stream.
[01:57.71]My name's Jeremy.
[02:00.27]I did a preemptive tweet, so we're all set there.
[02:02.93]Don't have to worry about that at all.
[02:10.48]I accidentally swallowed a clipped toenail.
[02:13.84]How the hell did you accidentally swallow a clipped toenail?
[02:16.40]How does that make any sense?
[02:19.42]Did you... Alright, were you like clipping your toenail and like you opened your mouth right when it went... And you... Like a bee flew down your throat?
[02:28.06]How is that possible?
[02:28.82]What have you done?
[02:29.32]Right off the bat, thank you Stix for the 342.
[02:36.96]Can't wait to see Zumbinius today.
[02:38.28]Nope.
[02:38.92]We have a plan for this week.
[02:40.92]I've got a plan for video games for the next two weeks.
[02:43.99]Do you understand?
[02:44.93]Two weeks we got planned.
[02:47.44]Here's how it's all going to go down.
[02:48.54]I'm not going to say it yet because there's zero viewers here.
[02:51.30]My Twitch hasn't updated.
[02:52.34]First of all, I highly recommend you start drinking.
[02:56.43]No, I'm not going to.
[02:57.25]No, forget it.
[02:58.85]If you know what this is, if you can tell what this is, then you know what I'm drinking.
[03:04.85]Here we go.
[03:11.62]Okay, there's your sponsor.
[03:13.08]There's your advertisement.
[03:20.88]No, it's not a Heineken.
[03:29.15]No, you guys all got it all wrong.
[03:35.87]It's coconut water, come on!
[03:42.22]Ladies and gentlemen, if you want a refreshing drink,
[03:47.30]one that cleanses the palate and makes you feel a little bit lighter and brighter in your shoes.
[03:54.28]Vita Cocoa, pure coconut water.
[03:58.29]Drained from the Alps inside the mountain, we take our drills and we go straight in and we get them right out of the side of the mountain.
[04:12.08]From the freshest coconut mountain springs,
[04:24.21]I had one the other day, I hated it.
[04:25.35]No, no, don't drink the regular one.
[04:26.69]Wait, wait, wait, slow down.
[04:28.17]Everybody slow down for a second.
[04:30.78]Do not drink normal coconut water.
[04:33.46]It tastes like stomach acid.
[04:35.36]Don't drink it.
[04:36.30]What you want to do is you want to get the pineapple-flavored coconut water or the mango-flavored coconut water.
[04:44.46]It takes away the disgusting, smelly, stomach acid, battery acid, puke taste and smell.
[04:51.37]And then it tastes good.
[04:55.92]Coconut water is good for you.
[04:58.22]It's just expensive and, you know, you can just drink regular water.
[05:01.90]But it doesn't have it big.
[05:02.94]But does regular water have as much potassium as coconut water does?
[05:07.25]I don't think so.
[05:07.79]Don't think.
[05:08.11]Yeah, you couldn't answer me that one, could you?
[05:11.43]Anyone know the motto?
[05:12.17]You want to know Vita Coco's motto?
[05:13.89]Let's get... What's their tagline?
[05:19.17]Chill it.
[05:20.11]Don't spill it.
[05:21.49]That's how you fucking write a tagline, I'll tell you.
[05:24.44]Honest to God.
[05:27.54]That is how you make a proper got you advertisement.
[05:38.84]Potassium is radioactive?
[05:40.42]What the fuck are you talking about?
[05:42.69]Potassium is radioactive.
[05:45.73]You know what else is radioactive?
[05:47.57]Everything.
[05:49.93]Your shoes are radioactive.
[05:52.79]The dirt is radioactive.
[05:59.01]Like, if you're sitting in a basement right now, I'm sitting inside of a basement.
[06:03.53]I'm down in my basement.
[06:05.41]It is radioactive down here.
[06:07.95]I had to do a radioactive radon test to see if I, like, wanted to, like, buy this place.
[06:13.22]And guess what?
[06:14.10]It was, like, kind of, it was, like, just barely at, like, the acceptable level.
[06:17.98]Everything's radioactive.
[06:19.78]I'm breathing in radiation right now.
[06:23.40]I just am.
[06:27.72]Anyways, I went to play Hand of Fate 2 tonight, a game that I've been looking forward to, if you remember from years ago, like two years ago, three years ago.
[06:38.08]I made a video on this game, on the original one, not this one, and it was one of my favorites.
[06:44.37]They had a really great idea.
[06:45.75]It was a small team, and it looks like they got a bunch of more development time and a
[06:53.99]We'll see if Hand of Fate 2 is apparently much better than the first one.
[06:58.29]So we'll try it out.
[07:01.48]You don't know what I'm drinking, but it's not coconut water.
[07:03.48]Yes, I am.
[07:04.58]It says it on the front label.
[07:06.44]Pure coconut water.
[07:08.12]They can't lie to me like that.
[07:12.55]Anyways.
[07:14.59]Thank you, Stix.
[07:16.25]They said, can't wait for the Zumbinis.
[07:17.75]Wait, wait, wait, before we go.
[07:19.49]Let's talk about... No, we'll talk about the schedule in a little bit.
[07:24.14]Thank you, Turian, for the $5.88.
[07:27.87]Thank you, Gunther, for the $5.
[07:30.25]You made a bet that I was going to be late and you lost.
[07:32.03]Well, I'm sorry, man.
[07:33.23]Sometimes you go to the casino and you lose.
[07:35.89]Turian7, thanks for the $5.88.
[07:38.09]Good, you opened this message.
[07:39.31]This isn't actually a... What are we talking about?
[07:43.85]Military commands.
[07:47.33]No, I'm not reading it.
[07:48.87]Thanks for the six dollars though.
[07:50.75]Uh, Commander, thanks for the bits.
[07:52.05]Cool Cat, thanks for the two dollars.
[07:53.21]Do you have any favorite Pok√©mon?
[07:54.53]Squirtle.
[07:54.85]It's classic.
[07:56.49]I like it because he looks like a mini blue ninja turtle.
[07:58.71]So, there you go.
[07:59.61]Sue me.
[08:00.69]Heretic Anchorite, thanks for the fifty cents.
[08:02.57]Hey Jerma, I'm just waking up in the morning.
[08:04.01]Got to, thank God, I don't know, but today seems kind of odd.
[08:07.33]No barking from the dock.
[08:08.43]What is with you guys and songs?
[08:10.15]Honest to God.
[08:11.91]Who, like, started the song shit?
[08:13.79]Moo means moo.
[08:14.49]Thanks for the five dollars.
[08:16.23]I heard Dean Dingus is promising to give a foot massage to each voter.
[08:19.96]That's what the middle class is all about.
[08:21.44]I'm voting for that guy.
[08:22.34]Don't vote for that guy.
[08:23.68]Vote for me.
[08:25.84]And Sam N. Thank you, Sam, for the bits.
[08:30.58]Are you trying to convince me to be healthy?
[08:34.06]Uh, no.
[08:35.56]Not necessarily.
[08:37.46]Alright.
[08:38.48]Cutscene!
[08:42.26]Bigot!
[08:45.54]What?
[08:48.71]Probably log.
[08:49.85]Your memories are fading even now.
[08:52.63]Gone to form the soul of the game we play.
[08:55.95]Oh, this is running bad.
[08:56.71]These pieces are new, as are the stakes.
[09:01.11]Life, death, and vengeance.
[09:04.20]What's going on with this frame break?
[09:05.64]We must ride, for time is short, and you have much to learn.
[09:11.01]Make your first choice, and let us set these wheels in motion once more.
[09:17.05]Oh, the dealer is back.
[09:19.39]Is this running, like, terrible for anybody else?
[09:23.80]We'll see.
[09:24.08]Might have to change.
[09:25.36]Might have to make a few changes.
[09:27.78]Alright, so do I want to be Adam or Reeve?
[09:32.70]Looks like Eve gets, like, dire wolf spells.
[09:37.06]And she has a bird.
[09:37.88]She has a godly bird in the top.
[09:39.49]Look, I... Mom, I can't talk to you right now.
[09:45.81]Looks like... Adam is the... We're going to be Adam.
[09:51.36]Mom, you really threw me off.
[09:54.82]These cards represent your history and our game.
[09:59.70]We know where they end, for you are here.
[10:02.79]Therefore, these cards must guide you to my side.
[10:06.19]Talk to you, Mom.
[10:07.43]Look, no.
[10:07.71]I texted her earlier.
[10:09.89]She gets it.
[10:12.55]The Fool.
[10:13.69]The Fool steps into nothingness because they know no better.
[10:18.69]In the same way, you must step into the void.
[10:22.25]So this is not a card game.
[10:23.25]You are a blank slate, and together we will write your history.
[10:29.30]This is not a traditional card game.
[10:31.30]You fight this.
[10:31.92]It's a brawler.
[10:34.78]You've stumbled many miles through this forest in search of the thieves who robbed you.
[10:39.53]Though exhausted and hungry, you are determined to reclaim your father's amulet.
[10:44.77]Forest Ambush.
[10:47.45]Four of Greed and the Leader.
[10:50.85]How are you on?
[10:51.39]Wait a second.
[10:52.79]Is this too fucking loud?
[10:58.09]I feel like this is a little loud.
[10:59.27]I'm going to drop it by like this much.
[11:01.91]See if that works.
[11:08.58]You finally catch up to the thieves hacking at a large tree and arguing among themselves.
[11:14.86]Move closer to eavesdrop or keep your distance?
[11:16.68]I'm going to sneak up and eavesdrop on them.
[11:20.28]I think that's a good idea.
[11:24.56]Alright, so... He's gonna explain it, I don't need to.
[11:26.58]So I have a 75% chance to succeed on this one.
[11:43.35]If you don't know how this works, you get a series of choices that you can make.
[11:48.03]And you have to actually roll to see if you get those choices.
[11:51.03]And by roll, he dishes out cards.
[11:53.81]Four cards.
[11:54.89]Sometimes it's gonna be 50-50.
[11:56.44]Sometimes it's gonna be 75-25.
[11:59.30]Sometimes it's gonna be very, very difficult to do.
[12:02.98]So this should be a... I mean, it's a 75% chance.
[12:04.96]And we failed.
[12:05.38]Okay.
[12:12.88]Turn on Twitch voting.
[12:17.30]I actually, I'm probably gonna play this on Thursday.
[12:20.12]So, we'll, I wanna like play the game like just like solo.
[12:24.95]Just solo.
[12:26.93]And then on Thursday we'll turn on the Twitch integration.
[12:30.21]So, for tonight, we're just gonna play the regular game.
[12:33.41]Because Twitch integration, everyone's gonna like fuck me over and do a bunch of awful shit to me.
[12:37.87]I'd rather like experience just the regular game first.
[12:42.05]So you try to eavesdrop on the conspiring thieves, but their voices are muffled by the bushes.
[12:47.01]You shuffle closer to get a better view.
[12:49.77]You soon spot a group of farmers coming around the corner, bringing their wares to market.
[12:55.29]The thieves fell the tree into the path of the unsuspecting farmers and leap out, weapons brandished.
[13:00.74]Give us all your food!
[13:03.32]You leap to the farmer's defense, offer to help the farmers, warning them it won't come for free.
[13:09.00]Help the thieves with their extortion.
[13:11.84]Well, as the Joker would say, if you're good at something, never do it for free.
[13:18.50]Offer to help the farmers, warning them it won't come for free.
[13:22.35]We have no gold, but half our crop is yours if you protect us.
[13:28.65]You got it.
[13:29.01]The thieves eye you nervously.
[13:31.61]The farmers look at you hopefully.
[13:34.63]Did you ask for more food?
[13:36.39]No.
[13:37.23]No, I'm not going to be that mean.
[13:39.97]We'll go with five food.
[13:43.30]Except you draw your weapon with practiced skill.
[13:49.09]Well, you hear the leader's voice.
[13:51.35]You lads handle this.
[13:52.99]I'll beat you when you're done.
[13:57.55]And now we go fight at eight frames a second, apparently, for some reason.
[14:03.78]There's equipment, there's items, there's thieves, there's imagery, there's graphics, there's...
[14:09.20]Vulcal lines.
[14:09.88]Alright, something ain't right here.
[14:13.18]Something ain't right here.
[14:14.68]Thug.
[14:15.20]Violence for the sake of violence and theft for the sake of money.
[14:17.99]Thieves attack frequently and can evade standard attacks, making heavy weapons less effective.
[14:23.87]Let's see.
[14:24.53]Okay, yeah.
[14:25.17]I know how to play.
[14:26.33]This is just Batman.
[14:28.20]It's just Arkham Asylum.
[14:30.18]Shadow of War.
[14:31.14]Same exact thing.
[14:33.27]But this is not running well.
[14:38.39]I don't know why.
[14:39.31]Let me try something here.
[14:40.37]Does that fix it?
[14:44.17]Does that help?
[14:44.95]That helps a little bit.
[14:48.53]I wonder what's going on here.
[14:53.53]I wonder what is going on here.
[14:58.75]Low-end PC.
[14:59.61]Dude, I got a 6-core 1080i.
[15:08.09]Let's just see if that helps at all.
[15:11.61]That actually does help an extreme amount.
[15:14.05]That is like fixed.
[15:16.93]Alright, so remember, this is Batman Arkham Asylum.
[15:20.29]So hitting Y is defend, your standard X is your attack.
[15:27.35]Okay, so the prompt is actually a little bit different than the last game.
[15:34.46]Okay, so it's when the green pops up over their head.
[15:36.88]Just like that.
[15:37.42]Okay.
[15:39.19]And then you can finish him off by sticking the sword directly in his neck.
[15:46.17]This is way better than the last game.
[15:47.91]I can already tell you that.
[15:52.47]This game... Was it green before?
[15:55.88]I think you could swi- I think I might switch it.
[15:58.10]I think you can switch it to yellow.
[16:02.14]Anywho, with the bad guys dispatched, the farmers turn to you.
[16:08.42]I hope your price doesn't prove too high.
[16:11.08]If the next harvest comes short, we'll starve regardless.
[16:14.95]Well, remember, if you're good at something, never do it for free.
[16:19.31]You fall on the food with a sigh, shoveling bread in your mouth to quell your hunger.
[16:24.89]Your satisfaction lasts only a moment before you realize your father's amulet is not among the takings.
[16:30.90]You consume one food.
[16:34.67]Their leader must still have it.
[16:36.51]You set to your feet, determined to find him.
[16:40.70]And we keep going this way.
[16:42.92]A friend in need.
[16:44.88]While enjoying a moment besides the fire, you spy a strange figure approaching your camp.
[16:50.26]It's a goblin dressed in what must pass for goblin finery.
[16:54.19]From beneath a filthy fox pelt serving as an ill-fitting wig, the goblin winks at you with wild red eyes.
[17:02.40]I've been roaming for hours trying to find you.
[17:04.70]We must get this over with quickly, if I have any hope of getting to all these people on my list before sunrise.
[17:10.34]It lowers his sack from its shoulder.
[17:12.45]Now, from within my sack, I can conjure whatever your heart desires.
[17:16.29]The goblin's voice trails off as he examines his sack.
[17:18.95]Well, I could if there wasn't a booming great big hole in it.
[17:22.37]His head disappears entirely into the bag, and his bulbous nose protrudes from the breech.
[17:29.45]A new plan, then!
[17:30.51]The goblin pulls out his last trinkets.
[17:39.74]Warriors, axe.
[17:42.44]Soldiers, a sword, axe, or a shield.
[17:45.90]I want to go with sword.
[17:49.06]So, this has crit.
[17:51.88]One-handed weapon, critical strike.
[17:52.86]Perform a powerful critical strike.
[17:54.32]So, this has crits.
[17:55.56]I can do a parry.
[17:57.98]One-handed.
[17:59.79]This is crits, armor breaker, and heavy.
[18:03.24]This is a heavy weapon.
[18:04.80]I'm going to stay light.
[18:05.88]Let's stay light.
[18:06.64]The shield is obviously just a shield.
[18:07.90]We're going to go with the sword.
[18:10.68]Damage 15.
[18:12.24]Go axe.
[18:12.64]You want me to do the axe?
[18:14.09]Everybody wants to be the axe man?
[18:18.15]Riposte.
[18:18.71]I know, but I like to say parry because I'm a moron.
[18:20.41]Alright, we'll do axe.
[18:21.41]Fine.
[18:24.21]We'll equip the axe.
[18:26.38]Shield.
[18:29.80]Alright.
[18:30.56]Yes, I would like to equip the warrior's axe.
[18:35.26]A wise choice.
[18:36.24]Now I must go.
[18:37.24]There are many others I must visit before I can rest.
[18:40.30]The goblin runs off into the night, his fox wig flapping in the evening breeze.
[18:44.30]You can change equipment in the inventory.
[18:46.09]Let's keep going.
[18:51.35]But first of all, thanks.
[18:52.17]Never trust a purple for the ten bucks.
[18:54.17]Make sure you run for the cave with gold in it and die getting to it.
[18:57.61]Getting hit in the head with boulders.
[18:59.49]Proving you've learned nothing in six years.
[19:02.19]That's probably gonna happen.
[19:03.37]But thanks, dude.
[19:04.81]Galaxia, thank you for the $5.
[19:06.93]Since yesterday was the third anniversary of Rat Movie Mystery of the Mayan Treasure, will we get any Rat-related content in the near future?
[19:14.16]Probably not.
[19:14.94]Unless it's in this game.
[19:16.18]Maybe.
[19:17.80]Thank you, Rytanic, for the bits.
[19:19.02]Also, Stix for the bits again.
[19:20.10]Does any of your family members watch you?
[19:21.44]What do they think of your YouTube and Twitch?
[19:24.94]No, they don't.
[19:25.42]My family doesn't like me.
[19:26.56]This card has a token.
[19:28.33]Can you find it?
[19:30.39]To get a token, you have to do something perfect, from what I remember.
[19:36.29]Your journey through a forest is interrupted by an inquisitive child.
[19:41.14]Are you searching for the forest folk?
[19:44.12]My uncle says that they used to walk these woods giving out gifts.
[19:48.08]I want to find one and ask for a lemon cake.
[19:53.50]As they dash off to peer under a nearby log, the child shouts back.
[19:59.82]Remember, if you meet the Forest Folk, get me a lemon cake.
[20:04.98]In the other direction, an eerie song hangs in the air.
[20:07.30]You attempt to find its origin.
[20:11.18]So this time, I think you can watch or try to... God damn it!
[20:15.99]I fucking failed twice in a row and it's 75% fucking chance!
[20:22.58]You've spent hours traveling in circles until night falls, bringing an unnatural silence to the forest.
[20:27.88]You consume one food.
[20:28.88]We don't get the token!
[20:29.82]God damn it!
[20:35.42]Fail only run coming up here.
[20:37.70]Nothing could be more fitting now than meeting the mage who started this all.
[20:42.17]Or at least started it all for you.
[20:45.10]A trail of fallen trees and distraught farmers leads you to the thieves who had stolen your amulet.
[20:50.21]It seems their infighting has only gotten worse.
[20:52.69]The bandits surround their former leader, weapons drawn.
[20:57.67]Everyone will get their fair share.
[21:00.02]There's no need for violence.
[21:01.98]The leader implores.
[21:04.58]Who ever heard of a thief talk about fair shares?
[21:08.20]You turn up and boss us around and we've barely stabbed anyone.
[21:11.73]It's been days since I've stabbed anyone.
[21:13.95]Days.
[21:15.54]The leader notices you approaching and waves you over.
[21:18.34]As much as I'd love to continue this discussion regarding my stabbings, I'm afraid I have urgent business with my associate here.
[21:25.78]As he greets you, he whispers, Keep me alive and there'll be plenty of gold for your trouble.
[21:33.13]Tell him gold cannot replace the amulet he stole.
[21:35.93]Tell him he will pay in blood for his thievery.
[21:43.05]I don't know.
[21:47.69]Should we work with this guy?
[21:51.16]Paying blood?
[21:51.72]I think... I don't know.
[21:53.38]I think this guy deserves a little bit of a... Blood for the blood god.
[21:58.93]What?
[22:02.44]Ah, tell him you will pay in blood for his thievery.
[22:06.25]He grins.
[22:08.11]Here's a thought.
[22:09.59]Does it have to be my blood specifically?
[22:12.93]Kill my associates and I will gladly return your amulet.
[22:16.63]Ever reliable, the thieves draw their blades to mug you.
[22:19.61]The leader hurries away to hide.
[22:21.03]Okay.
[22:24.81]Give us your stuff or we'll stab you up, growls one of them.
[22:28.01]You consider your options.
[22:29.99]Fight?
[22:30.35]Give them all of your food and gold.
[22:34.02]You think like four shitty fucking bandits are gonna make me give all my food?
[22:37.92]No, fight them.
[22:39.94]You draw your weapon and prepare to deal with the miscreants.
[22:42.60]The miscreants.
[22:44.45]Thieves evade heavy weapons more frequently.
[22:46.59]You can change equipment in the inventory.
[22:48.15]Well, looks like I'm about to lose.
[22:55.57]Here we go.
[23:00.11]It's only four.
[23:01.57]Three, two, one, fight!
[23:06.69]I am going to change this to yellow.
[23:11.59]Nah, get out of here.
[23:16.49]One thing I do like about this game, it doesn't just auto-swing across the whole map at somebody.
[23:22.06]Have you noticed that in some of these Batman-style games?
[23:26.58]Right now, if I hit right and attack, I would launch over across the whole screen.
[23:32.28]It's not in this game.
[23:36.22]Alright, that's cool.
[23:41.30]They haven't evaded one time.
[23:42.46]Well, I think they're just teaching me.
[23:44.01]Telling me.
[23:48.25]Combat is vastly improved, it seems.
[23:51.67]With the battle resolved, the thief leader nods in approval at the carnage before him.
[23:56.47]He holds out a hand.
[23:59.57]The name's Malacalypse.
[24:01.14]Malacalypse.
[24:02.22]You can just call me Malacca.
[24:05.46]By an extraordinary!
[24:07.58]His smile fades under your withering glare.
[24:10.10]Sensing your anger, he raises his hands in surrender.
[24:12.72]Wait a minute, let's not be hasty.
[24:16.00]We're on the same side here.
[24:17.96]I'm an upstanding citizen, just like you.
[24:20.36]I've been working with the thieves, yes, but only for the greater good.
[24:24.24]No really, they were killing people before I came along.
[24:27.90]I know it seems bad, but look.
[24:30.15]He pulls out an amulet from his pocket and presses it into your hands.
[24:34.11]All is forgiven.
[24:35.45]Yeah?
[24:38.20]You stare at the amulet.
[24:39.18]It does not look familiar.
[24:41.84]Oh!
[24:43.50]Sorry about that.
[24:45.26]So which one of these is yours?
[24:46.70]And he opens up a satchel in front of him.
[24:50.80]Choose your father's amulet.
[24:54.06]Hmm.
[24:58.02]His accent got more southern as he kept talking.
[25:01.01]Well, he's a thief.
[25:01.71]He's a liar.
[25:02.31]He's a swindler.
[25:02.99]He's making up an accent Okay, well we got the lion Okay, the lion the witch in the wardrobe and the bird If I was gonna pick one of these, okay, let's go over this I wouldn't be the lion I
[25:26.43]I definitely wouldn't be the pharaoh.
[25:29.88]I definitely wouldn't be the bull or the ox.
[25:34.60]I think I would have to go with the... I think I'm gonna have to go with the bird.
[25:38.58]I would assume I would call myself like a falcon if I had to.
[25:46.31]I know it's a sphinx!
[25:47.51]Do you understand?
[25:48.57]I'm being the bird!
[25:50.07]Choose your father's amulet.
[25:53.51]Ah, the Eagle Amulet.
[25:55.29]That suits you.
[25:56.07]Very similar facial structure.
[25:58.45]Say, you know what?
[26:00.09]I'm lonely.
[26:01.03]You're lonely?
[26:02.39]We should work together.
[26:04.19]You've befriended Malocalypse the Trickster.
[26:10.93]We should probably get to know one another.
[26:12.93]See it as we're going to be friends for life.
[26:15.64]Tell me, where are you from?
[26:23.57]Where am I from?
[26:30.17]No, that's not like the right voice for him.
[26:31.79]I gotta change his voice again.
[26:33.07]Alright, here we go.
[26:35.43]Who am I?
[26:35.85]Do I have to pick like a random... I'm a bird!
[26:41.91]Oh.
[26:44.11]Uh... Choose an appearance.
[26:46.75]Oh, you just have to pick like a random appearance.
[26:50.13]I have to make like me.
[26:53.88]Do I change his haircut?
[26:56.28]Alright, well, I'm going, like, fucking bald, so... No, I don't like that.
[27:04.21]No, I don't like that either.
[27:09.53]Should I just do, like, the tuft on the top of his head?
[27:13.75]Alright, we're gonna do... No.
[27:14.95]We're just gonna go bald.
[27:18.39]What is this?
[27:19.94]Choose an outfit color.
[27:21.28]Oh.
[27:22.16]Well, where's the Jerma985 colors?
[27:23.72]That's the closest one.
[27:25.66]These are the closest ones to the Jerma985 colors.
[27:30.00]Okay, that should be good.
[27:34.30]That should be good.
[27:42.02]Generic bald guy.
[27:43.30]Yeah, I know.
[27:47.66]From the Eastern Belt, you don't say?
[27:50.44]Good sorts from the Eastern Belt, very trusting.
[27:53.20]That's more appropriate.
[27:55.58]Oh, by the way, I mean, we, friend, owe money to Vignus the Thieves' Guild.
[28:01.20]He's quite angry with us.
[28:02.92]We should journey to Mire Bridge together to appease him.
[28:05.72]Some gold might help.
[28:08.53]Come to think of it, I'm rather busy.
[28:10.89]Malacalypse Eye is a pretty traitor hiking up the road.
[28:14.33]So, it'd be best if you get the gold and I beat you there.
[28:20.38]No, it's not.
[28:21.60]It's worse.
[28:25.20]That doesn't work.
[28:25.82]Look at him.
[28:26.14]He was like a little squirrely guy with a fucking cartoon bandana and like a cartoon banjo.
[28:33.30]He's a bard.
[28:33.70]In a cartoon house!
[28:52.26]You enter a competition of strength at a fair.
[28:54.35]A gold prize is available to the winner.
[28:56.07]10 gold.
[28:58.03]In the first round of the competition, your opponent is the diminutive Roland, a halfling from a traveling troop of acrobats.
[29:03.89]Oh, we gotta roll dice here?
[29:07.51]Okay, two rolls, we need 10.
[29:08.49]These dice are another small game embedded in our game.
[29:11.64]No, these are more mechanics.
[29:16.24]Okay, so we gotta shake him up and throw.
[29:21.42]Oh, I can't remember.
[29:22.96]Eleven, baby.
[29:26.96]Oh, man.
[29:28.90]Even more like RNG in the RNG game.
[29:32.53]That's so funny.
[29:34.21]Roland is no match for your strength.
[29:35.59]He gives a disappointed backflip off the table and collects his meager winnings.
[29:40.21]Then cartwheels out the door.
[29:43.53]You got 20 gold.
[29:45.13]You take your reward from the purser on the way out of the tavern.
[29:48.74]When you return, you will compete in the next round for a larger prize.
[29:53.32]Return.
[29:55.68]Can you actually go backwards now?
[29:58.12]Let's go up.
[29:58.48]Deep water.
[30:00.36]While crossing a stone bridge...
[30:08.30]What concern is worrying at your mind?
[30:11.48]This is deep water.
[30:12.26]Let it fall into the waters beneath.
[30:14.45]So eventually, if you guys don't know, let's just break down.
[30:17.83]People have no idea what's going on.
[30:20.14]I'm eventually going to make a deck that I have to play through.
[30:24.56]And it'll be... Well, there's other people's decks that they put their own cards in your deck.
[30:32.06]And you have to essentially play through a deck of cards that have different, like, choose-your-own-adventure options or brawls or fights.
[30:39.02]And it can be pretty interesting.
[30:41.40]So, let's keep going.
[30:44.20]While crossing a stone bridge, you suddenly find yourself confronted by a villainous band.
[30:49.88]Four of Blight.
[30:51.96]So that Four of Blight means that there are four people of this certain type of enemy.
[30:57.02]So if that was like a Six of Blight or like a Two of Blight, sometimes you get more than one card.
[31:02.99]You could stand and fight the fiends or throw yourself to the mercy of the river below.
[31:07.39]Stand and fight or lay... No, we're going to fight.
[31:09.56]You ready your weapon.
[31:10.96]Always fight.
[31:11.82]Kick everybody's ass.
[31:22.09]Abandoned quest.
[31:23.77]So these are like ghouls.
[31:24.66]Blight is like ghouls.
[31:26.74]So these guys inflicted.
[31:29.60]The graphics are definitely ten times better than they used to be.
[31:33.20]The first touches of corruption bring forth the darkest elements of their victims.
[31:37.33]Infected enemies are feeble, causing them to become knocked down when health is low.
[31:41.53]Use a finisher before they recover.
[31:44.27]Okay, so I guess I guess they have to be finished.
[31:47.08]I don't think I can just kill them.
[31:52.69]Like, for instance, this guy.
[31:54.33]Like that.
[32:00.61]Six out of six.
[32:01.51]I'm not sure what that means.
[32:03.21]Oh, that's bad.
[32:04.15]Okay.
[32:07.59]There is a dodge.
[32:08.39]Whoops, a daisy.
[32:09.30]Yeah, there is a dodge.
[32:10.08]I'm just showing you.
[32:11.44]Showing you what it looks like.
[32:14.68]Left trigger, it seems to be the execute.
[32:17.22]So these guys have to be... No, I guess they don't have to be executed.
[32:24.69]That's actually a pretty clever combination of gameplay with monster tropes.
[32:31.01]This game is awesome.
[32:32.73]The first one was awesome, too.
[32:34.13]It was just extraordinarily difficult.
[32:36.65]The first game was full of so much RNG that it was nearly impossible to beat the game.
[32:41.79]From what I remember.
[32:42.47]I remember getting to the final deck, and it was just uncompletable.
[32:46.96]I just couldn't do it.
[32:48.66]It was like rolling dice.
[32:49.64]It was like throwing 100 dice in the air and looking for 50 sixes.
[32:53.28]That's what it was like for me in the first game.
[32:56.16]But it's very, very, very, very fun.
[32:59.68]If you have never played the first one, it is a trek, but it is very good.
[33:06.99]Having spilled your enemy's blood, you search the bodies for anything useful.
[33:10.83]Gain an armory card.
[33:11.85]So, you get to pick one.
[33:13.19]I already have a soldier's sword.
[33:14.73]Wait, is it better than mine?
[33:16.47]No.
[33:17.89]I can't put this on, because I'm two-handing right now.
[33:21.89]I'll just take the shield.
[33:24.35]Hand of Fate is my only Twitch highlight.
[33:27.51]It really is.
[33:30.28]From, like, four years ago.
[33:32.02]So, nearing the sleep... This is called Carnival.
[33:45.37]Follow the parade, ask local about what's going on, or carry on.
[33:47.13]I'm gonna follow the parade.
[34:08.74]The parade ends in the town square.
[34:10.24]You watch as the villagers take turns smashing the statue with a club and gathering the food and gold that spills out.
[34:16.30]A local notices your interest and asks if you would like a turn.
[34:26.48]I'm gonna watch a local go first.
[34:28.04]Because, I don't know, it might be, like, cursed.
[34:34.06]You allow a young girl to go ahead of you in the queue, an act of courtesy that grants you the opportunity to see how this works.
[34:40.72]The crowd cheers enthusiastically as the child smacks the lizard man's ankle with the club and gathers a few coins and a wrapped sweetbread that fall out.
[34:50.01]It's soon your turn.
[34:51.53]You accept the blindfold and take the club into your hands.
[34:55.43]Alright, we get a huge success chance.
[34:57.18]I think it's this one.
[35:00.34]Oh my fucking god.
[35:06.64]I'm never gonna win.
[35:11.56]You wield the club with all your strength, however the blindfold affects your balance and you bring the weapon down on your own foot.
[35:19.48]Oh my god.
[35:20.38]5 damage.
[35:29.81]Engulfed in shame, you leave the town to their celebrations and hope no tales are told of this day.
[35:40.26]The roads have become even more deadly since the Empire has come to power, despite their promises of the opposite.
[35:50.47]The road ahead is blocked by an overturned carriage and a woman calling for help.
[35:55.33]Please help!
[35:56.65]I've been robbed by a band of thugs!
[35:58.81]Is there anything you can do?
[36:01.66]I feel like this is an act.
[36:03.41]Alright, we're going to get 12.
[36:05.03]Let's try it.
[36:05.49]Assist the distressed woman.
[36:08.25]Two rolls remaining.
[36:08.97]We're trying to get to a target of 12.
[36:10.19]12.
[36:10.37]Exact.
[36:13.87]I'm good at dice.
[36:14.47]I'm not good at picking cards, though.
[36:19.24]Thank you, the woman says as you help her from the carriage.
[36:22.60]Please accept this as a token of my gratitude.
[36:24.68]10 gold.
[36:28.63]Two gold cards.
[36:29.35]Nice.
[36:31.79]You thank the woman and continue on your way.
[36:34.44]So let me see what... I want to do this.
[36:36.62]What happens if I go back here?
[36:37.78]No.
[36:40.44]Because it said on your way back.
[36:42.40]So this is the exit here.
[36:44.61]Here we come to the end of the beginning.
[36:47.03]Running errands for mages.
[36:48.43]She didn't even need help.
[36:49.51]This will become a theme, I dare say.
[36:54.03]Okay, dead drop.
[36:55.37]You arrive at Mire Bridge as the sun begins to dip below the horizon.
[36:58.93]And this is a chance for a coin.
[37:00.61]A coin, if you don't know, a coin is a card pack.
[37:03.69]That's what that is.
[37:04.75]You want these.
[37:05.75]You want to get as many of these as possible.
[37:09.64]You find Molokolips perusing a selection of cheeses by the market.
[37:15.06]Ah, if it isn't my good friend, the adventurer.
[37:18.24]Did you bring the gold?
[37:19.76]Vignes has arranged to meet at the graveyard.
[37:28.13]Loot boxes.
[37:29.03]There is no paid loot boxes in this game.
[37:31.33]You only earn them.
[37:32.24]You have to earn them.
[37:33.08]You gotta work for them and you got... I just... My nail just went into the wood.
[37:37.50]Am I that strong?
[37:38.66]Well.
[37:40.42]We're gonna... The only way you get the card pack is if you do the encounter perfectly.
[37:55.42]You have to do it perfectly.
[38:01.02]I'm gonna keep exploring.
[38:02.81]No.
[38:03.15]Oh, damn it.
[38:03.75]I thought that meant, like, I thought that meant, like, explore the area.
[38:05.89]Okay.
[38:06.33]Well, fine.
[38:08.51]Go to the graveyard.
[38:10.29]You wonder whether the spot was chosen for its seclusion or for easy body disposal.
[38:15.73]Vignus greets Melancholyps with a sly grin.
[38:19.57]Looks like you turned up after all.
[38:21.99]With a lackey in tow.
[38:27.85]Vignis cracks his knuckles and giggles.
[38:31.39]You reveal your gold as Malacalypse scrounges in his pockets for some too.
[38:47.44]The heavy satchel of riches lands at Vignus' feet with a thud that echoes through the silence of the cemetery.
[38:53.66]You lose 45 gold.
[38:58.52]That's our deal, Malacalypse says, worry obvious in his voice.
[39:03.32]No need for further troubles.
[39:06.08]I'm sorry, Val.
[39:08.26]You should have known the guild was never going to let you pay with cash stolen from our members in the first place.
[39:17.73]And a fight ensues.
[39:24.26]It's a boss.
[39:29.80]There he is.
[39:30.68]Ashley, I'm drinkin', I'm smokin', I'm drinkin'.
[39:33.68]Vignus the Crazed.
[39:35.34]He's not crazy enough.
[39:36.30]I'll change his voice.
[39:37.90]Treacherous and greedy, a dangerous combination.
[39:40.62]Anarchists throw flaming bombs that cause fire damage.
[39:43.91]Your armor is no use to you here.
[39:46.68]Bigness the Crazed.
[39:47.79]Oh, and he's got a lot of lackeys!
[39:53.87]He doesn't know I have a dodge roll, does he?
[39:55.71]Yikes!
[40:05.63]Gotta take out the lackeys first.
[40:07.89]Bingo!
[40:11.50]These guys have a lot of health.
[40:23.40]I wanted to get no hit there.
[40:24.40]I wanted to not get hit once.
[40:25.58]He didn't hit me.
[40:37.88]Are there iframes there?
[40:48.33]He's dead.
[40:48.69]Woo!
[40:54.67]See you later.
[40:57.07]And cut off his head!
[41:00.26]Goodbye.
[41:05.86]Do I get to do a dying voice line?
[41:11.96]And I got the fucking coin.
[41:13.70]Here we go.
[41:14.66]Open the card pack.
[41:15.32]Different accent again.
[41:40.24]This looks way too easy.
[41:41.36]Oh boy!
[41:42.36]I'm going to have to ask you to hold on and excuse me for that one.
[41:46.90]This is like the tutorial.
[41:51.21]Judging by the first one, the first one was an outrageously punishing, excruciatingly difficult game after the first two decks.
[41:59.85]So, just be aware of that.
[42:02.66]This is like the intro to the game.
[42:05.96]Alright, for Completing the Fool, you got a Cardinal Blade and a Bastion of Purification.
[42:12.75]For Completing the Fool, again, Market Thief.
[42:16.65]Tarts, pies, and exotic lies, fork in the road, arm wrestling.
[42:22.38]And that Market Thief has a point there.
[42:24.84]For Befriending Malacalypse, Malacalypse's problem and the trickster.
[42:31.17]I'm saying his name so wrong.
[42:34.20]Welcome to my challenges.
[42:36.28]Together, we will traverse 22 paths of wisdom and despair in the hope of awakening.
[42:43.68]22 separate decks, I guess, is how this is going to work.
[42:47.45]So the fool, the magician, is the next challenge.
[42:52.75]Let's go.
[42:57.69]Rescue the missing Empire soldiers from a town plagued with corruption.
[43:02.43]Growing scourge.
[43:04.09]Prepare to fight corrupted.
[43:06.17]Avoid Empire.
[43:07.05]Lose gold for every Empire killed.
[43:11.41]So this is where we get to kind of make our own encounters, right?
[43:15.24]So I can put in... I think I have more than five, right?
[43:19.60]So let's put in... This is unknown.
[43:22.94]If you don't know what the card does...
[43:28.00]You have to just land on it in the random deck, right?
[43:31.78]Fill your deck with encounter cards.
[43:33.12]These are the places you visit on your journey.
[43:35.78]So I guess we're going to do... We'll do... Let's do the ones that have tokens, right?
[43:40.91]Market Thief.
[43:43.25]Finding... Finding Forest Folk.
[43:47.03]And what other one have we not seen?
[43:48.11]This one... Tarts, Pies, and Lies.
[43:50.71]And Fork in the Road.
[43:56.33]See what if I inspect this Draw this encounter during a challenge to discover his traits.
[44:01.28]I can't like I can't game the system here, you know That's five encounters and then we put in equipment cards, too So cardinal blade.
[44:11.28]I don't know what it is because I haven't seen it.
[44:13.48]So we're gonna do Those two obviously in these three that's what we have to have and companion is malacca lips
[44:25.87]Let's try the new cards we haven't seen.
[44:30.11]Anyways, thank you to AJ Dog for the $1.
[44:33.82]Hey, Jerma, when you take your next vacation, I would suggest going to Penn-Is-Land.
[44:43.30]It's a great spot.
[44:46.61]Well, thanks for the $1, but let me just say...
[44:52.94]I'm going to read... You put a space there.
[44:55.28]I'm going to read that as pen is.
[44:58.83]There's a space.
[45:00.91]Maybe when I read it, I was like, whoa, look at that.
[45:05.42]Thanks, though.
[45:07.81]KJ8011, thanks for the $4.
[45:09.55]Rewind to Flanker.
[45:11.08]I am getting some Sorcery vibes from this, which is why I love this game so much.
[45:14.38]And it's a predecessor.
[45:15.26]But thank you for the $4, dude.
[45:18.16]Darkstar7000, thanks for the $1.
[45:19.80]Oh man, this is reminding me of Sorcery.
[45:21.52]Huh?
[45:22.74]No, I know, I know, I know.
[45:24.10]I know, I understand.
[45:29.36]Um, but thank you for the one dollar.
[45:30.62]This is reminding me of sorcery.
[45:31.85]It is.
[45:32.09]It's that same kind of choose-your-own-adventure.
[45:35.55]Uh, encounter.
[45:37.58]Surprises.
[45:38.06]But thank you, dude.
[45:39.88]Thank you to, uh, Cersei Tentones for the five dollars.
[45:43.92]I wish I was half as good at making voices for characters like you for Pathfinder and D&D games.
[45:49.33]Don't listen to chat.
[45:50.17]Those were good voices.
[45:53.25]Thank you, dude.
[45:54.13]Thanks for the $5.
[45:55.86]Even though all of my voices are a variation of the same one voice.
[46:00.92]It's either like this, or like this, or like this, or like this, or like this.
[46:06.37]I got range.
[46:07.28]I do have range.
[46:08.04]I'll prove it to you.
[46:08.68]I'm going to prove it to you this encounter.
[46:10.10]The next thing, watch this next voice you get.
[46:13.18]Give me a demon and you'll hear the gravelly shit.
[46:15.60]I don't need a fucking pitch shifter.
[46:16.90]I don't need a voice changer.
[46:18.26]Go listen to any of these guys that do fucking voice acting and shit.
[46:21.80]They have a studio where the person is making all these changes.
[46:25.33]Remember when Peter Dinklage was the Destiny robot?
[46:29.39]I mean, it was awful.
[46:30.99]But they pitch shifted him and gave him robot voices.
[46:34.13]They didn't do that to me.
[46:35.21]I didn't get that.
[46:38.68]That's what I'm talking about.
[46:40.80]Anyways, thank you Rytanic for the bits, Glorels for the bits as well, and Mr. Celsius.
[46:46.71]Thank you.
[46:48.11]$51.
[46:48.15]Any plans for Condemned 2?
[46:51.55]Yes.
[46:52.53]Condemned 2 is going to be on Friday.
[46:53.49]A casual call to heroism.
[46:56.58]How many adventures start thus?
[46:58.54]We're going to play Condemned 2.
[47:00.40]We're going to start it on Friday.
[47:06.73]For 100 years I have thought about nothing but the game.
[47:09.88]I was defeated.
[47:12.30]It is true.
[47:13.92]I became complacent long before then.
[47:17.01]I thought I knew everything about the game and what it could be.
[47:21.28]Now you see before you the extent of my research.
[47:25.44]I have crafted this game anew.
[47:27.70]So it looks like it's not decks anymore.
[47:29.28]It's just kind of like missions.
[47:31.14]Interesting.
[47:32.70]Anyways, Whispers from the West.
[47:34.90]Your conversation with a fur trader is interrupted as Maloclips arrives in a flurry.
[47:41.88]The whispers speak of trouble at the edge of the Empire.
[47:44.34]The town of Westwind is suffering against the Blight.
[47:48.60]Find out more about Westwind.
[47:51.24]What do you want to know?
[47:53.82]Where is it?
[47:55.80]Westwind sits on the outer edge of the Empire.
[47:58.47]While the Emperor focuses on the capital, its nobles and merchants, those of the fringes are neglected.
[48:03.79]Okay, so it's right in the middle.
[48:08.33]What makes this place so special?
[48:10.85]I've traveled far to escape the oppression of the Empire.
[48:13.61]Westwind gave me my freedom, and I intend to return the favor.
[48:18.47]What about your protection?
[48:20.79]A small garrison is meant to be protecting the town, but apparently they are all either dead, missing, or drunk.
[48:27.78]That's enough.
[48:29.90]Alright, let's go.
[48:31.94]You return to the markets and ask if any traders headed to Westwyn might need an escort.
[48:37.46]There are three options.
[48:39.70]A stone Mason, a food wagon, or a weaponsmith.
[48:45.03]So, I'm gonna say food, because I want food.
[48:52.29]A food wagon headed to a nearby wedding offers you a ride.
[48:55.49]They gift you some food in exchange for not taking you the whole way.
[48:59.17]Oh, fuck you.
[49:01.11]That's alright, five food.
[49:01.97]Food is important, you use food every time you take a step.
[49:05.49]You arrive at the town of Westwyn.
[49:06.91]To defend the town, you'll need to locate as many Empire soldiers as you can before the Blight invades.
[49:13.47]Oh shit, okay.
[49:15.46]I need to recruit soldiers?
[49:18.36]Alright, there's an opportunity for a card pack here.
[49:23.46]Your journey through a forest is interrupted by an inquisitive child.
[49:26.46]Oh yeah, this is this one.
[49:31.07]You know the voice.
[49:32.79]Are you searching for the forest folk?
[49:34.81]My uncle says that they used to walk these woods giving out gifts.
[49:38.13]I want to find one and ask for a lemon cake!
[49:41.64]As they dash off to peer under a nearby log, the child shouts back, Remember, if you meet the forest folk, get me a lemon cake!
[49:48.06]In the other direction, an eerie song hangs in the air.
[49:50.14]You attempt to find its origin.
[49:51.70]Okay, like, let me do this one.
[49:56.71]Thank you.
[50:00.11]Success.
[50:02.17]You follow the song through a thicket and stream until you find an open glade bathed in golden sunlight.
[50:07.75]You find an aged maiden, her posture bent like the bows of a forest.
[50:14.43]It has been twelve winters since I had a visitor.
[50:17.91]Her voice is a whisper, yet it thunders in your ears.
[50:23.65]You may visit me when you are in need, adventurer.
[50:28.18]I found the Forest Maiden.
[50:29.14]Doink.
[50:29.87]Okay.
[50:30.01]Malacalypse is possible.
[50:50.19]Uh, so hold on.
[50:52.09]I remember in the first game, it was, you could, I thought you can't follow the cards.
[50:56.47]I thought that that was just like an illusion, that everyone was like, you can watch them!
[50:59.73]And I thought, is that actually true?
[51:02.46]Because like, I've tried to do that before, and sometimes it just doesn't work.
[51:07.06]Or is it actually just, it's just randomly sprayed out?
[51:09.76]This guy's a villain.
[51:15.64]You actually can.
[51:18.12]You can watch them now.
[51:20.53]You could always follow the car.
[51:21.59]I feel like it was impossible to do.
[51:28.13]You can watch them now.
[51:29.01]You couldn't in first game.
[51:31.75]I think you could.
[51:34.45]Sometimes they're hidden.
[51:35.57]Whatever, we'll figure it out.
[51:38.57]You arrive at the city markets to meet with Malacalypse's associate.
[51:41.99]You find him sitting on a blanket by the sewer gates.
[51:44.25]You can't tell whether he's a goblin, a human, or an animate pile of greasy rags.
[51:49.81]A few wilted daisies and duckweed tied with rope are flopped on the ground around him.
[51:55.64]Merk!
[51:56.66]Malacalypse calls to the creature, arms outstretched.
[51:59.58]I have a favor to ask of you, my handsome friend.
[52:02.82]The greasy goblin man raises a hand to stop the bard's prattle.
[52:07.30]Ten gold threats, you know that.
[52:12.58]I only have ten gold.
[52:16.07]Let's do it.
[52:18.35]Molocalypse steps forward as Merc counts the coins.
[52:21.99]Merc, I'll be in.
[52:24.57]I require help in removing a certain illness.
[52:29.15]Merc considers Molocalypse for a while.
[52:31.97]That kind of information costs more than a few coins.
[52:36.37]You splutter indignantly.
[52:39.95]I will require a test of skill from him.
[52:46.87]Pick a flower and eat it.
[52:49.78]The greasy florist displays his meager wares.
[52:53.08]Monocalypse nods as if this were a fair request.
[52:59.54]Eat a daisy.
[53:00.79]Eat a forget-me-not.
[53:02.35]Eat the luminous purple flower.
[53:12.29]Eat a forget-me-not.
[53:13.25]Am I going to lose my memory?
[53:19.76]Alright, let's go with two.
[53:22.54]Eat it, forget me not.
[53:23.98]The flower tastes pleasantly of berries and grass.
[53:28.36]Oh, Lord.
[53:29.08]Okay, we need a 12.
[53:30.52]Oh, God, we need two sixes?
[53:35.35]Oh, no, okay.
[53:36.67]I thought there was two die there.
[53:38.29]I was about to freak out.
[53:39.57]We got it.
[53:42.45]You feel a little starry-eyed.
[53:45.49]Quick, what day is it?
[53:47.39]Melocalypse and Merc wait urgently for your answer.
[53:52.71]It's a good day.
[53:55.83]Callous day, the fourth of the second winter.
[53:58.30]It's a good day.
[54:01.12]The florist and the bard exchange an approving glance.
[54:06.59]Merc nods, happy with the results.
[54:09.29]He beckons Melocalypse closer.
[54:12.34]Got it.
[54:12.58]Oh no, not her.
[54:31.89]Wait, no, no.
[54:32.61]Oh, no, not her!
[54:34.45]Malacalypse straightens his neck, shawled nervously.
[54:37.49]The greasy goblin man giggles maniacally.
[54:40.44]That's her.
[54:41.80]She'll likely eat your bones before she lets you speak.
[54:47.14]Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a business to run.
[54:50.80]With that, Malacalypse's associate turns away and hurls a bouquet at a shocked passerby.
[54:56.13]Flowers!
[54:56.93]Fresh flowers!
[54:58.13]Buy them or I'll eat your eyes!
[55:04.59]You find some Imperial soldiers... You find some Imperial soldiers strung up by Northerners.
[55:19.12]Okay, they can't... Oh, fuck.
[55:22.08]Fight to free them, I can't pay.
[55:24.55]No Imperial soldiers can die, right?
[55:29.79]I'm starving.
[55:31.19]We had nothing but forget-me-nots for three days.
[55:34.48]Fight.
[55:36.08]One-handed weapons are recommended against northerners.
[55:38.06]You can exchange equipment in the inventory.
[55:41.20]Okay, so I guess I just have my inventory.
[55:45.52]I don't have a sword.
[55:47.67]I have a villager's axe.
[55:49.47]Yes, I do.
[55:49.87]I have a neglected sword.
[55:53.89]And I have this shield, and yeah.
[55:55.65]Alright, so I do have just like a piece of shit.
[55:57.89]I have like a... I have a nerf foam sword.
[56:01.33]Alright, one-handed weapons are recommended against northerners.
[56:06.47]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:07.23]Let us see if the mage can help you here.
[56:10.27]Yeah, I thought you... the companions do something, right?
[56:17.35]There's different companions in the game you unlock over the course of the game, right?
[56:23.70]Take a bow!
[56:27.96]You'll need my book for help!
[56:29.35]What am I doing?
[56:30.01]Am I doing like a Street Fighter intro for this guy?
[56:34.07]A magician, a jester, and a vagabond.
[56:36.61]When activated, Melacalypse casts a protective spell on you that can block a single hit.
[56:45.04]Companion ability is Left Bumper.
[56:48.08]If nothing else, I'll get a song out of this!
[56:50.16]I told you that's how his voice was!
[56:53.07]See, everyone's like, that doesn't fit, doesn't fit.
[56:54.57]That is his voice.
[56:58.53]Now I don't have to do it anymore.
[57:02.48]Let's try it.
[57:03.22]Can you do it?
[57:04.22]I don't have it yet.
[57:08.30]So I had the voice correct.
[57:10.58]Oh shit, I'm gonna get fucked up here.
[57:15.73]Can you do it?
[57:16.11]I can do it.
[57:17.85]I'm trying to test the spell and I can't do it apparently.
[57:23.17]I wonder why.
[57:23.67]Oh, that guy just instantly died.
[57:35.60]Ow, I'm gonna, like, die.
[57:39.06]Alright, the left button, like, how do I get him to do the spell?
[57:47.21]Oh, I have to be standing right next to it.
[57:49.31]Okay, I get it.
[57:52.12]Okay, now that was weird.
[57:55.46]I have to be right next to it.
[57:58.78]It can take one hit.
[58:04.33]I took way too many hit points there.
[58:07.99]Actually, Cardinal Blade.
[58:08.79]Here we go.
[58:10.73]One-handed weapon.
[58:12.37]Fire magical blades in eight directions when activated.
[58:14.47]Blades cost 20 damage or 40 damage to corrupted.
[58:18.55]Bash causes an additional damage to armor.
[58:22.62]Can repose between enemy combo attacks.
[58:24.44]Additional defense from a shield is useful.
[58:26.82]Yeah, let's get it.
[58:27.40]I want to try it.
[58:28.30]Let's put it on.
[58:28.92]Like a compass, it indicates the truth of all directions.
[58:35.70]Has a shield, never uses it.
[58:37.16]I don't think you can block.
[58:38.20]I think you can only do, like, the Batman, like, triangle-wide block.
[58:45.03]With the northerners dead, you free the soldiers.
[58:46.35]You gain two recruits.
[58:53.57]The general store.
[58:56.44]The shopkeeper nods to you as you enter.
[58:59.34]Adventurer!
[59:00.52]How's the world out there?
[59:03.31]Buy equipment, buy food, buy healing.
[59:06.51]Well, let's buy healing.
[59:11.15]I can get 10 health.
[59:12.95]Can I sell anything?
[59:15.71]No, I'm not selling that.
[59:16.73]Yeah, I need to eat.
[59:18.90]I need healing.
[59:21.00]Let's spend 8 gold for 10 health.
[59:24.70]Yep.
[59:28.22]And that's enough.
[59:30.47]What do you get for equipment?
[59:32.23]Yeah, nothing.
[59:33.77]Sell the old sword?
[59:34.73]I don't think I can.
[59:35.77]Yeah, I can only sell the card in a blade.
[59:44.00]No food.
[59:44.86]No food.
[59:45.70]Isn't that a six?
[59:51.04]Alright.
[59:51.59]Wait, wait, wait.
[59:52.97]I know there's Twitch integration.
[59:54.35]Listen.

[60:35.07]And then Friday's going to be Condemned 2.
[60:36.37]I'm going to start Condemned 2 on Friday.
[60:40.81]I am right here, and we have things to do.
[60:43.74]Oh, he's getting angry at me.
[60:55.76]Viewers get to vote, but I still get to pick yeah, but I don't know I feel like if everybody if people have like know what the encounters are I've seen what the encounters are I don't want to get it like right or wrong every time like You guys don't know talking about it.
[61:08.91]Oh, I wonder what I have to do 80% of Twitch voted for that one specific thing that they knew was how to win or lose instantly and their Objectives you'll see even those numbers which were once the stairs now vary per challenge as you will see I
[61:24.85]Check and vote on buffs and nerfs.
[61:29.35]The DM is getting impatient.
[61:34.70]Twitch integrated PC build.
[61:36.88]Oh god.
[61:39.34]Alright, so we're in Westwind's Plague.
[61:45.76]The Westwind Tower bell chimes feverishly.
[61:48.37]The town crier bellows.
[61:51.14]This corrupted inside the town.
[61:53.30]They broke through the sewers and into the Louie's Lane.
[61:55.98]Our brave soldiers have gone down there to sort it out.
[62:02.19]You arrive to find Westwyn's few remaining soldiers huddled at the entrance to its poorest area, Lois Lane.
[62:10.40]We cannot let the corruption spread.
[62:12.30]For the good of the town, we must dispose of anyone who's been tainted, even a little.
[62:19.15]Yeah, let's join them.
[62:21.07]We join in the fight against the corrupted.
[62:22.71]Here we go.
[62:33.99]Cognoblade.
[62:39.15]And here it is.
[62:40.75]Aw yeah.
[62:44.51]Prepared for violence in every major direction.
[62:49.41]Sounds good.
[62:49.85]Oh, okay.
[62:50.27]These guys can't die.
[62:51.37]Cardinal Braid is pretty sick!
[63:06.00]Execute.
[63:06.76]Execute.
[63:08.15]Let's test out with the ability pass.
[63:10.95]That's actually pretty great.
[63:14.27]That's pretty great!
[63:20.43]That's really good, actually.
[63:24.34]The combat looks better.
[63:25.12]The combat is way better.
[63:28.68]With the corrupted threat removed, you've ensured that these soldiers survive to aid the town's defense.
[63:34.82]The soldiers help you scavenge what you can from the remains of the poor souls taken by the corruption.
[63:41.09]Get an equipment card.
[63:41.97]It's just the...
[63:47.58]Wooden shield is what I have now.
[63:49.32]It's a bastion of purification.
[63:51.56]Against corrupted, defend causes 30% of your weapon damage to attackers.
[63:55.81]That's cool.
[63:57.41]Reduces your movement speed by 10%.
[63:59.21]And I can use defend to block attacks from ranged enemies.
[64:06.61]Alrighty.
[64:06.93]Got some food.
[64:10.26]Actually, way more than that.
[64:13.78]Here's the remainder.
[64:16.24]I'm gonna go in my inventory.
[64:17.18]I have the bolt on, right?
[64:18.24]Yeah.
[64:19.40]Alright, I'm gonna go... Let's go right.
[64:21.38]That sounds like a plan.
[64:27.79]More captured soldiers.
[64:30.21]Yeah, let's just fight three of them.
[64:33.21]You ready your weapon?
[64:33.83]Let's go on.
[64:37.74]Do I have an actual block now?
[64:46.12]Is there a backstory on the character playing the game?
[64:48.22]Oh, I'm actually not sure.
[64:51.18]Raider, from the frozen darkness of the far north they come.
[64:53.84]Northerners can perform a combo attacks.
[64:56.76]Use riposte with single-handed weapons to deal extra damage immediately after you defend.
[65:01.92]Right, okay.
[65:07.88]Like that.
[65:13.04]Let's try that again.
[65:14.59]There it is.
[65:27.31]Did I get them both?
[65:28.63]I did.
[65:32.36]I got them both in one super move.
[65:39.20]Five max life.
[65:40.44]Fifteen gold.
[65:42.92]And I got two recruits.
[65:44.42]Eight recruits in total.
[65:49.44]Hey, thank you, Cree, uh, Krazy.
[65:52.28]Krazy CEO for the $1.
[65:54.04]I love your streams.
[65:54.66]They make me laugh in some of the hardest times of my life.
[65:58.16]Heart.
[65:58.46]Well, thank you, Krazy.
[66:00.16]Appreciate it.
[66:01.68]They place themselves in these dire positions.
[66:04.42]Thank you, Pika Flare for the $1.
[66:05.32]And then expect a hero to come rescue them when things become too much.
[66:10.46]Uh, no, this is not Battletoads.
[66:11.60]Not quite.
[66:12.90]Thank you, Pika.
[66:14.26]Harvey Birdman, thanks for the $2.50.
[66:15.18]Just wanted to let you know, Rat Movie is definitely in my top 200 movies.
[66:19.86]I show it to all my friends and they love it for some odd reason.
[66:23.12]Well, I'm glad to be in your top 200 movies.
[66:28.02]Honest to God, um... That actually, I don't know, is that an insult?
[66:34.89]I'm not sure because... Top 200?
[66:39.55]I can't even name you like 30 or 40 movies I've ever seen.
[66:45.99]You can name 200 movies you've ever watched, that's more movies than I've ever seen in my entire life.
[66:52.50]If you do the math here, if I watch, let's say if I go to the movie theater, like, I probably watch like 10 movies a year, right?
[67:02.62]So, 10 fucking movies a year, I'm 32.
[67:07.83]So let's see, that means I have to be able to, I don't think I'm even, I couldn't even do it.
[67:14.45]That's 100 movies in 10 years.
[67:17.91]200 movies in 20 years.
[67:18.91]I don't think I've even seen that many movies.
[67:22.64]Is that an insult?
[67:23.60]Or what?
[67:24.92]Thank you.
[67:28.20]320 movies.
[67:28.70]I'm not talking... You don't watch movies when you're one years old.
[67:33.04]I know the math.
[67:33.68]I know it's 320 movies, but I'm not... What am I going to watch as a movie when I'm one?
[67:38.53]Or two?
[67:39.53]Three?
[67:40.43]You don't watch movies when you're that young.
[67:44.19]Your parents put up like a dream catcher above your head and they spin it around.
[67:49.36]And it's got little toys and planes and helicopters and bugs.
[67:53.64]And it makes like the same shitty wind-up song.
[67:56.10]You're not watching a movie.
[67:56.92]That's not a movie.
[68:00.66]Let's go from like 10.
[68:01.94]From 10 years old.
[68:03.96]There you go.
[68:05.00]That's 220 movies.
[68:12.01]I've watched 500 movies easily.
[68:20.82]I'm not 320 years old.
[68:21.80]Oh, my God.
[68:22.60]Alright, let's keep going.
[68:24.92]Thank you, though.
[68:28.69]Thank you, Mr. Celsius, Gloria, Glowrels, and Rytanic for the bits as well.
[68:35.80]Let's keep going.
[68:36.32]Stranded noble.
[68:37.84]While patrolling the outskirts of Westwind, you hear the clash of steel and the unmistakable groan of corrupted.
[68:43.34]Your investigation leads you to a distressed nobleman perched on the roof of his carriage.
[68:48.43]Thank the gods.
[68:49.77]I was heading to tea with the Duke Gilbert when we were ambushed.
[68:54.65]My footmen left me here to fight them off, but the brawl has now dispersed into the forest.
[68:59.44]The noble peers fearfully at the tree line.
[69:02.41]If you stay here and protect me, I can pay.
[69:04.51]Yeah.
[69:13.07]Wow.
[69:14.20]That's a nobleman's purse.
[69:17.02]Oh, great maker.
[69:17.92]Thank you.
[69:19.28]You linger near the nobleman's carriage in case the corrupted reappear.
[69:22.84]Just beyond the trees, you can hear the blood-curdling sounds of combat.
[69:27.11]screams and shouts echo long into the night.
[69:29.93]You wait, but no soldiers return from the battle.
[69:32.65]The nobleman climbs inside his carriage, curls into a ball, and sobs uncontrollably.
[69:38.04]He will not be moved or roused.
[69:42.10]Aroused.
[69:42.66]He will not be aroused.
[69:43.62]You return to Westwyn.
[69:45.88]Okay, well.
[69:48.38]Whoops.
[69:51.24]Thank you, Mr. Zombie Jesus, for the two dollars.
[69:53.12]If you dream... Did you dream catch a movie?
[69:54.88]Have any crushed bird juice when you were a kid?
[69:57.60]Yes.
[70:00.48]Here we go.
[70:00.86]General Store.
[70:01.38]You guys think that was a mistake?
[70:02.58]No.
[70:02.76]I have 37 coins now.
[70:05.16]The shopkeeper nods to you as you enter.
[70:06.66]Adventurer!
[70:07.28]How's the world out there?
[70:08.34]Okay, let's see.
[70:09.26]I have eight food.
[70:10.62]What do you got for equipment?
[70:13.36]Merchant's Ring.
[70:17.54]Merchant's Ring reveals shops...
[70:21.44]This just reveals the shops.
[70:23.04]Might as well just buy it.
[70:28.64]Yeah, let's just buy it.
[70:31.16]Put it on.
[70:32.54]A healing.
[70:34.38]Let's buy some healing.
[70:37.04]Yeah, might as well.
[70:40.70]And let's also buy... How much food could I buy?
[70:44.36]Uh, let's buy... Let's just... We got plenty of food.
[70:49.73]Just get to the, like, 11 food.
[70:50.73]Be good to go.
[70:51.71]Just, like, because I want to explore everything.
[70:55.83]Alright, let me... Select.
[71:01.25]So I can't sell these.
[71:02.21]Okay, I have the ring on.
[71:07.19]Yeah, I can't sell any of the Mourn ship.
[71:11.09]I can sell... No, I want to keep these all on.
[71:13.23]Do I have to, like, do I have to equip it to sell it?
[71:17.37]Let's just see.
[71:22.72]No.
[71:24.48]Nope.
[71:30.26]Alright, we're good.
[71:39.44]Leave.
[71:40.14]Last stand.
[71:41.22]I'm not ready for this.
[71:42.46]I want to see the other three cards.
[71:47.67]Uh, do you wish to summon the soldiers you have recruited?
[71:49.61]I want to search for more recruits.
[71:52.15]You retreat from the bell tower and westwind to search for more recruits, so we're going to go left.
[71:57.65]Market Thief, and we get a chance for a coin.
[71:58.75]In my day, thieves kept their distance.
[72:00.83]None would pickpocket a mage for fear of failure, or worse, success.
[72:08.24]The Market Bazaar is a hive of activity.
[72:10.82]Traders from across the lands call out to passersby to sell their wares.
[72:14.96]As the sun beats down on the crowded street, you pause briefly to draw water from a fountain.
[72:20.22]You feel something tug on the inside of your tunic.
[72:23.16]Turning quickly, you discover a pickpocket making off with some of your belongings.
[72:31.20]You jump to your feet and catch a glimpse of the thief as they weave through the crowd.
[72:35.82]Okay.
[72:36.22]Oh, Jesus.
[72:39.92]Fuck.
[72:41.56]I had it until the last pass.
[72:43.12]It's one of these ones.
[72:43.74]Shit!
[72:52.40]Tangled maze of people proves too much for you and the thief makes their escape You guys all had it wrong everyone saying three, but everyone's yelling at me it was one or two you lost it Name he made his name damn it.
[73:11.95]I want that coin fuck
[73:17.17]Tarts, pies, and exotic lies.
[73:26.65]You chance upon a wooden cart overflowing with pears, pies, and many other items.
[73:31.51]Otherwise, a wonderful smell wafts from the cart.
[73:37.80]Malaklip shakes his head.
[73:39.98]Poor old Chester.
[73:41.52]This is why you should never be seduced by the wiles of women, coin slave.
[73:45.67]They'll break your heart and leave you selling your lemon tarts with little business sense.
[73:50.39]The old farmer hawks his wares to pass it by.
[73:52.61]Tarts, pies, and exotic lies.
[73:58.36]Chester glares at two passing lovers walking hand in hand.
[74:02.64]To be young and naive, I...
[74:08.07]I have one coin.
[74:09.49]Buy an exotic lye.
[74:11.99]He passes you a bag of luminous blue apples.
[74:15.89]Have you ever felt the feeling of your heart being torn from your chest?
[74:20.85]I have.
[74:22.13]Chester stares so forlornly at you that you are forced to comfort him before the transaction can proceed.
[74:29.97]Chester stares in a kind of wistful gloom at the exotic fruits for a while before he finally decides on a price.
[74:38.42]Ten gold?
[74:38.92]Oh, God.
[74:39.18]It's this one.
[74:39.66]No, it's not!
[74:40.04]Shit!
[74:40.16]I only have one gold.
[75:02.94]In your life, you will have wandered endless intersections yet this one sticks with you.
[75:09.86]Why?
[75:10.22]Why?
[75:11.26]Fork in the road.
[75:11.90]What is it in your memory that catches here?
[75:16.78]You arrive at a signpost detailing the possible path north and south.
[75:21.90]Milokov sniffs the air.
[75:29.22]My magical senses are pulling me toward the north.
[75:34.51]It smells like someone is baking cinnamon pie somewhere up ahead.
[75:39.53]What?
[75:39.69]That's it?
[75:40.82]Okay.
[75:48.29]Well, here we are.
[75:49.73]The top western town hall is a large bell tower.
[75:55.41]It is used to signal the day's end for the workers in the mines and surrounding fields.
[76:00.13]But now it will summon Westwyn's defenders.
[76:02.33]Do you wish to summon the soldiers you have recruited?
[76:04.98]Ring the bell.
[76:07.26]As night cloaks Westwyn, you can sense the corruption rising from the shadows all around you.
[76:12.10]You survey any soldiers you've managed to recruit.
[76:16.58]Eight of steel.
[76:18.31]You've gathered a large group of soldiers to defend the town.
[76:21.03]Here's hoping you won't need any more.
[76:24.39]Versus seven of blight and a terror blight.
[76:29.65]Okay.
[76:31.65]You must survive till morning when imperial reinforcements will arrive.
[76:35.59]Give a rousing speech or remain silent.
[76:37.79]No, you gotta give like a rousing, like, come on, men!
[76:40.31]Like in Braveheart.
[76:42.48]Oh, goddammit.
[76:46.02]I have no idea.
[76:46.58]Fuck.
[76:49.24]I think it's four or one.
[76:50.84]I think it's four.
[76:56.54]It's over... I think it's over here.
[76:58.18]I think it's four.
[77:01.38]Sorry, everyone in chat.
[77:05.96]It's... I don't know.
[77:07.50]One.
[77:08.36]Got it!
[77:11.09]Inspired.
[77:14.41]I told you it was either four or one.
[77:15.91]I just didn't know which... I just... Wherever it went.
[77:20.53]Your rousing speech imbues the soldiers with confidence and zeal.
[77:26.41]So when you get that, it... Allied Empire deal more damage now.
[77:32.49]Well, that helps me.
[77:34.11]This is going to be like a fucking Royal Rumble.
[77:36.51]There's going to be like 20 people on the screen.
[77:40.94]Is there actually going to be like fucking 20 units on the screen?
[77:45.58]Nobody can die, by the way.
[77:46.48]Oh lord.
[77:48.96]Terror of Westwind.
[77:51.04]As the final vestiges of humanity are erased, the terror wakes.
[77:56.23]Use bash to break the terror's corrupted armor and defeat it with a finisher before it regenerates.
[78:02.77]Men!
[78:03.83]Let's go!
[78:06.47]Oh, this is fucking actually pretty cool.
[78:12.36]Nobody died, right?
[78:19.22]Cut his head off.
[78:20.54]Alright, we have to surround.
[78:21.81]Okay, nobody dead yet.
[78:22.97]Watch out.
[78:29.69]Break it.
[78:30.33]Give me another one.
[78:35.47]Give me another one.
[78:37.95]Is everyone still alive?
[78:42.93]Alright, shield is broken.
[78:49.01]Oh, wow, that was a huge amount of damage.
[78:50.97]He grows back.
[78:53.83]Break the shield again.
[79:04.70]Oh, come on, man.
[79:05.40]Don't be such a baby.
[79:06.62]Rip scroll back.
[79:07.92]No, no, no.
[79:08.16]Dead.
[79:17.43]I think the zombies are defenseless.
[79:23.55]A mighty creature of chaos felled by your power.
[79:27.29]I've got to make a fucking reference.
[79:28.69]Does it satisfy you, this bloodshed?
[79:32.41]Knowing those you destroy were once simple peasants.
[79:35.93]I still make, look, just because I don't play TF2, I can't make like a TF2 reference because it's like, I do, I like, seven, eight years of my life was that game.
[79:47.42]Look, if you talk about like 320 movies, right?
[79:51.44]I have watched 150 movies worth of time in TF2.
[79:57.86]It's surprising I don't reference it every 15 seconds.
[80:00.88]Think about that, like 200 movies worth of time was watched in my screen facing me for TF2.
[80:08.26]What?
[80:09.16]Only 100?
[80:11.22]No, that's more than that.
[80:12.04]I have like two or three thousand hours in that game.
[80:14.51]How many movies is that?
[80:15.37]Hold on, let's do some math.
[80:17.21]Let's ask, how many movies is 2,000 hours?
[80:24.34]Siri, how many movies is 2,000 hours?
[80:26.22]Alright, so if your average movie, let's say I have 3,000 hours in TF2, divided by, the average movie is 90 minutes.
[80:36.29]That's 33 movies!
[80:37.58]No, wait a minute!
[80:38.32]No, I did it wrong.
[80:39.80]3000 hours.
[80:40.16]Divided by... 1.5.
[80:40.76]That's 2000 movies!
[80:41.46]I've watched 2000 movies!
[80:43.12]Imagine if like a movie was like fucking... 250 hours long.
[81:07.94]Oh, that'd be so stupid.
[81:09.01]200,000 movies!
[81:12.79]Alright, last stand.
[81:13.63]Give me that coin.
[81:33.52]The magician returns to the deck.
[81:36.56]But now we only begin our stories of fate, folly, and magic.
[81:41.42]Do not think I'm satisfied with this, but at least we have a place to begin.
[81:49.41]Now you have learned the simplest of ways to build your day.
[81:53.27]Each challenge will provide its own unique trials.
[81:56.30]Here are some more tools to keep you in good stead.
[81:59.20]Imagine if a movie really... Alright, hold on.
[82:01.08]Imagine if a movie really was, like, 1600 hours long.
[82:05.62]Or, like... Movie theaters would be houses.
[82:10.20]They'd be beds.
[82:11.46]And bathrooms.
[82:13.38]And kitchens.
[82:14.96]Imagine just living... Imagine sharing a space.
[82:18.19]with like 150 people in this room and you all live there and you all like somebody has to make food people are like going in and out you're missing the movie if you take a vacation think about that think of like if you were to leave and go to work and you miss like six hours of the movie that's a huge amount of material that someone's gonna have to catch you back up on that'd be fucking crazy
[82:46.79]Hey, can you catch me?
[82:47.87]Hey, dude, I went on vacation.
[82:49.13]I went to like Maui for like two weeks.
[82:51.12]Hey, what happened in the last two weeks in the movie that was on the screen?
[82:55.40]It'd be like, oh, Jesus Christ, man.
[82:58.60]Hold on.
[82:58.98]That's like hundreds of hours of content.
[83:02.90]I don't know.
[83:06.89]Alright, this is for saving the town.
[83:08.99]Ruby Ring.
[83:09.71]Valiant Regis.
[83:11.55]Valiant Aegis?
[83:12.63]Valiant Regis?
[83:14.29]You're on the belly of dollars.
[83:15.85]Winter's Bane.
[83:19.00]Man-Eating Tree.
[83:20.24]Gnomish Exchange.
[83:21.46]Lost Boy.
[83:23.30]Popper Plague.
[83:24.60]And West Wind Tavern.
[83:28.22]This is the coin card pack for doing one of the coin card pack things.
[83:33.48]For finding the Forest Folk, you've got the Old Maiden.
[83:36.96]There she is.
[83:40.72]Mm-hmm.
[83:42.78]For convincing Merc to help, Miloklips.
[83:46.45]The Underneath.
[83:47.05]Uh, ring-ding-ding.
[83:52.93]Let's go.
[83:57.12]As you play, you will find more options open to you.
[84:00.93]Cool.
[84:01.87]Should you find yourself blocked or overly challenged, take the time to explore the board.
[84:08.23]Unlocking cards will give you options you have not yet considered.
[84:12.22]Okay, so...
[84:16.54]We have the High... Alright, we have... We have three options here now.
[84:19.40]We have the High Priestess, the Empress, and the Emperor.
[84:22.78]And I'm going to pee my fucking pants.
[84:25.02]So... Remember, one hour goes by in one of my streams and I have to pee for like a full two minutes.
[84:33.21]Give me one second.
[84:33.77]I'll be right back.
[84:34.39]I will BRB.
[85:33.54]so so
[86:57.36]You are now entering the Empress.
[87:00.56]What are you guys doing?
[87:04.36]What are you guys up to here?
[87:06.88]Something going on?
[87:08.99]Somebody trying to do Jupiters?
[87:09.87]What's going on here?
[87:12.45]Uh, anyways.
[87:15.49]I missed so much of the movie.
[87:16.53]No way.
[87:18.52]Because, like, six hours of a movie that was a thousand hours long would be, like, the equivalent of going to the bathroom and sprinting back during, like, Harrison Ford's big speech and you whisper to your friend, you know, you guys know what I'm talking about, you go to pee and, like, you know that, like, more than, like, three or four minutes have gone by.
[87:38.05]And it was in the middle, right before Harrison Ford, like, turns and goes, like, don't you, and you're like, fuck, I gotta, like, run out.
[87:43.40]And you run, run, run, run, run, you pee, pee, pee, pee, pee, quicker, come on, come on, come on, you're, like, pushing it as hard as you can.
[87:47.68]You get there, you sprint back, and, like, there's, like, two guys, like, lying on the ground, and, like, Harrison Ford has the pistol, and he's like, and that's what happens when you fuck with me!
[87:55.55]And you whisper your friend like, dude, what the fuck happened?
[87:57.71]And he looks at you and he's like, shut the fuck up, man.
[87:59.67]And like, he looks back at the screen and you keep tapping and you're like, dude, why did those guys die?
[88:03.91]What happened?
[88:04.73]And he's like, dude, you fucking touched me again.
[88:07.01]And you are never getting a ride to the movie theater.
[88:08.96]And then the person behind you is like, shut the fuck up.
[88:11.82]And then you turn and you're like, I'm sorry.
[88:14.22]I just don't, why are those two guys lying on the ground?
[88:16.94]And he's like, alright.
[88:18.38]Harrison Ford was the killer.
[88:21.48]And it turns out that the guy that's on the ground on the left, you see the left?
[88:25.57]Yeah.
[88:27.37]That guy accidentally killed Harrison Ford's wife, and she's actually not dead.
[88:33.43]She's been in a coma.
[88:34.51]A coma?
[88:35.03]Yeah.
[88:36.65]How much of the movie did I miss?
[88:43.46]Just watch the fucking movie.
[88:52.18]Nice stand-up routine.
[88:54.04]Not a stand-up routine.
[89:00.14]No, but that guy would understand.
[89:02.14]He would be like, did you pee during the movie?
[89:04.26]Yeah, I saw you go out.
[89:05.92]I know, my bladder sucks too.
[89:08.97]And then we would go like this.
[89:11.21]And I would blow him a kiss and he would catch it and go... Anyway.

[90:19.92]and let's keep moving yeah I feel better I feel pretty better dragoon we got a large support network in here everybody here's uh we around we talk about this sometimes but everyone is really like you guys are all good shits so they need to talk to anybody then you know obviously there's plenty of people around so let's uh alright the empress the emperor or the high priestess
[90:49.78]Let's go right in the middle, the Empress.
[90:52.96]So this is 10 encounter cards.
[90:54.38]Okay, so here we go, the Empress.
[90:58.22]Earn fame in order to wield the legendary weapon, Fretha's Ire.
[91:04.11]Villages on the northern outskirts are under assault from northern raiders.
[91:07.35]Defeat the mighty shaman who is leading their raids.
[91:11.23]Gain enough fame to wield the mighty Fretha's Ire.
[91:14.79]Encounters with northerners are common in these parts.
[91:18.56]Okay, let's try it.
[91:21.18]We can deal with the Northerners.
[91:23.42]Let's do the cards we have not seen.
[91:24.52]The Underneath.
[91:25.98]The Tavern.
[91:26.60]Gnomish Exchange.
[91:28.84]Lost Boy.
[91:30.08]Man-Eating Tree.
[91:31.93]Popper Plague.
[91:32.55]The Old Maiden.
[91:33.91]Market Thief.
[91:34.77]I want to try to get that one.
[91:37.13]Arm Wrestling.
[91:39.55]And... I want to do this one.
[91:47.50]I feel like this one could lead pretty well.
[91:52.73]yeah and equipment let's do the cardinal blade winter's bane the bastion two rings and we have to take them all because we only have his eight alright let's give it a go let's try to beat the empress
[92:15.91]In this case, the empress is a symbol, a leader of the northern clans, but not their only one.
[92:26.13]What does the moon mean?
[92:29.24]Now we come to one of the new nuances of our game.
[92:32.68]More mechanics.
[92:33.52]The hunt for fame and esteem would not work for all players, but it works for you.
[92:41.34]I can sense it in you.
[92:43.68]Your pride.
[92:44.65]hmm your skill okay in time we will learn all of you so many mechanics elder's gift raiders have destroyed our village the elder of talos explains in a hushed voice they were sent by a dark shaman of the north
[93:07.56]They were searching for this.
[93:09.42]He draws a large warhammer from his cloak.
[93:12.72]Shathrasaya, it is the only weapon that will break the seal protecting their encampment.
[93:18.70]He hands you the weapon.
[93:21.88]Well, okay, here it is.
[93:27.34]Shockwave.
[93:28.34]Requires eight hits.
[93:29.12]Perform a powerful strike that causes knockdown to a single target.
[93:32.78]Impact tracks enemies and causes stun.
[93:36.78]armor breaker and its heavy bash deals additional damage to armor and enemies wealthy blocks so I don't have enough fame to to use it I need 20 fame oh it's an it's an actual new card mechanic it's a fourth card okay the weapon is heavier than you imagined perhaps weighed down by some hidden magic preventing you from wielding it to its potential you require 20 fame to equip this weapon earn fame by completing encounters
[94:08.41]The elder looks straight in your eyes as though peering into your soul.
[94:12.01]Not all weapons are for men.
[94:14.45]All of them.
[94:16.73]Can I do that one again?
[94:19.44]Yeah, just try it one more time.
[94:21.12]Okay, thanks.
[94:22.58]From the top.
[94:24.90]Not all weapons are for all men.
[94:27.64]Only those who have deem it... Can I try that again?
[94:31.59]I'm slipping up on the middle of the line there.
[94:35.37]Yeah, just do it one more time.
[94:37.05]This time, just slow it down when you get to the middle.
[94:41.19]Okay.
[94:41.41]Yeah.
[94:41.53]Can I change one of the words in there?
[94:42.81]It's, like, really fucking me up.
[94:46.23]Okay, yeah.
[94:46.63]I'll do it.
[94:47.53]From the top.
[94:50.43]Not all weapons are for all men.
[94:53.07]Only those who have demonstrated great acts of valor and courage may bear hath resire.
[94:58.76]You do well to remember that.
[95:02.76]Okay.
[95:03.50]Let's ask some questions.
[95:06.26]What would you like to know?
[95:07.38]Make it quick.
[95:09.56]Uh... Bye.
[95:15.02]You must find the courage to wield this weapon and defeat the shaman before the fifth village falls.
[95:20.77]The villagers need a hero.
[95:22.57]The town of Braden is surely in danger and must be warned.
[95:29.13]Oh.
[95:30.51]Well, thanks for revealing the place I need to go.
[95:35.90]Thank you.
[95:37.00]I trust the sacrifice of Talos.
[95:38.96]Not go in vain.
[95:40.55]He bows his head.
[95:41.99]May the gods have mercy on your soul.
[95:44.75]I was thinking about doing a little bit of a... added a little bit of flair there.
[95:48.61]I don't feel like the character didn't want to say that line in my mind, in my motivation.
[95:56.40]Let's go.
[95:58.62]Let's go... go down.
[96:01.70]children lost by it's hard to conceive that either of us were ever such he's just a small child you over here a deeper voice growls we have to take him to the dungeons or else he'll run straight to whatever northern clan he spawned from and show them where our outpost is that's a shifty looking kid I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him
[96:32.25]Shave the boy.
[96:33.09]That's all I can do.
[96:35.87]Unsheathing your weapon, you demand they let the boy go.
[96:39.77]Okay.
[96:40.17]The Empire soldiers are unmoved by your threat.
[96:44.91]Am I fighting against them?
[96:49.59]I thought I was just... Alright.
[96:54.38]I guess I have to... I'm being a bad guy now.
[97:00.99]Watchman.
[97:01.97]Taken from the dregs of society, elevated to petty positions of power.
[97:06.01]Watchmans can block.
[97:07.61]Greatly reducing incoming damage.
[97:09.11]Use bash to open them up.
[97:17.11]Get out of my town!
[97:18.23]Get out of my town!
[97:20.62]Okay, I thought that was shooting me.
[97:22.46]I like how you can do the double block.
[97:27.50]It's like a crow hop.
[97:35.02]Oh, what?
[97:37.92]What the fuck?
[97:42.40]Hi-yah, hi-yah, hi-yah.
[97:50.24]Go ahead, block it.
[97:51.26]That's fine.
[97:52.34]And you.
[97:53.24]Whoa, that was weird.
[98:05.82]Am I using this shitty sword?
[98:06.96]I am, because you start over every mission you start over.
[98:11.74]You don't carry over the same items that you had before.
[98:17.23]Gain 10 life.
[98:19.43]As you check on the unconscious guards, you notice the boy looking at you warily, as if sizing you up.
[98:26.07]Oh, what?
[98:26.75]Oh, God.
[98:27.17]13.
[98:27.99]Shit.
[98:31.84]Choose which dice to reroll.
[98:33.20]What is that?
[98:34.00]What is that?
[98:35.62]Is that a one?
[98:36.26]That's just a skull.
[98:37.58]It's a skull of one.
[98:42.53]I think... I don't know.
[98:45.79]Well, I got it.
[98:51.47]You brought your items?
[98:52.81]I did not bring any items.
[98:54.75]I put those items into the possible cards that are out there now.
[98:59.54]I don't have them in my inventory.
[99:04.87]See, if I go to my inventory, right?
[99:07.39]I only have this.
[99:08.65]I can't use this.
[99:09.73]And I have a shitty axe or a shitty sword.
[99:13.25]All I did was, at the beginning of the adventure, I said, Hey, I'd like to be able to use, potentially, these things I put in the deck.
[99:21.67]But, okay.
[99:22.29]He fiddles with a little dried plant hung around his neck.
[99:25.53]Nervously.
[99:27.97]Okay.
[99:28.89]I will tell you.
[99:30.53]There was an Empire ambush on our village, and I ran with Mother.
[99:34.45]We got separated.
[99:36.41]He wipes some tears from his face angrily.
[99:39.03]But I'm not afraid.
[99:40.70]I am of Clan Cat's Foot, and we are great Pathfinders.
[99:44.44]I will find my way home.
[99:46.62]The boy tells you what he knows of the area.
[99:51.54]Okay.
[99:53.33]Uh, well, I know everything now.
[99:56.43]Is this Harry Potter?
[100:01.50]The small northerner boy refuses any and all help.
[100:04.70]You can only wish him luck as his town, as his small form disappears into the forest.
[100:08.42]Yeah, he ain't too vain.
[100:11.18]Well, I want to, like, see everything.
[100:16.23]At what point does honor bend to pragmatism?
[100:20.73]Uh, yeah, she just gives you food.
[100:21.93]I've been robbed by a band of thugs.
[100:24.29]Is there anything you can do?
[100:25.09]Yeah, you roll dice and she gives you food.
[100:31.32]12, shit.
[100:31.98]Okay, well, this one.
[100:35.95]Fuck!
[100:38.89]The dice are fair, and thus you have lost this round.
[100:43.19]Why, thank you.
[100:44.35]Now, if you'd be so kind as to give me all of your gold.
[100:46.59]The woman draws a pair of concealed blades from her corset.
[100:48.91]Come on out, boys!
[100:51.84]You have no time to react as a group of bandits spring from hiding.
[100:57.32]And these guys, three of greed.
[100:58.48]These guys are going to get fucking destroyed.
[100:59.98]It's alright.
[101:06.20]Is this a new enemy, though?
[101:07.54]Greed?
[101:08.90]Oh, it's not.
[101:09.20]It's a thief.
[101:12.78]Stop helping people.
[101:21.51]Whoa!
[101:21.91]You came out of nowhere, but it's okay.
[101:33.56]Get out of my life.
[101:34.48]You're dead.
[101:35.72]Snake eyes.
[101:45.21]With the thugs defeated, you search their bodies for valuables.
[101:48.90]Alright, this is an easy roll.
[101:51.54]999.
[101:51.62]Got 10.
[101:53.16]Beautiful.
[101:53.70]Beautiful.
[101:55.51]You find some food amongst their possessions, and I got four fame.
[101:59.29]Seven food.
[101:59.75]Holy shit.
[102:01.49]Oh my god.
[102:02.13]Okay.
[102:03.17]Well, that was worth doing.
[102:06.69]The Underneath.
[102:07.49]This is part of this quest.
[102:08.75]Jeremiah and his trusted dickhead guitarist.
[102:10.65]David the Knight.
[102:11.39]Thank you for the $15.00.
[102:24.61]I forgot to type something last time I cheered, but just wanted to say you are actually the best streamer on Twitch.
[102:31.47]Well, thank you so much.
[102:33.87]That is a very humbling thing to say.
[102:37.79]For me to hear, is what I meant to say.
[102:40.30]That was a very nice thing to say, and it's a humbling thing to hear.
[102:43.18]So thank you, David, the Knight.
[102:45.88]I appreciate that.
[102:48.62]I'm trying my best.
[102:50.96]What would happen if I tried my worst?
[102:53.91]I don't know.
[102:55.81]I don't think there's ever been a stream where I just, like, wasn't trying.
[102:58.67]Like, I didn't give a fuck.
[103:00.21]I think that's never gonna happen.
[103:03.90]I'll tell you if that happens, though.
[103:05.16]I'm gonna be like, guys, today I just, like, don't give a fuck.
[103:08.12]We'll see what happened.
[103:08.74]I don't know.
[103:12.14]I would make Otto's adventure.
[103:17.21]Thanks, though.
[103:17.71]Thank you, Reaper, for the five dollars.
[103:21.01]Rat Movie 2 is better than Rat Movie, which is better than all other movies.
[103:24.99]I have to make a third one.
[103:26.05]I really do.
[103:26.71]And, like, who knows when the hell that's going to be.
[103:28.27]Remember my book?
[103:29.57]Remember when I copy and pasted random excerpts from my book like a week ago?
[103:34.45]But thank you.
[103:36.11]Thank you also to Deception, or Decepticon Seeker, Pika Flare, and Spectre for the bits as well.
[103:41.55]Just want to say you've helped me get through some tough times in my life.
[103:43.77]Thanks for all the laughs.
[103:45.35]Well, thank you for being around, Spectre.
[103:48.38]And Pika Flare as well.
[103:49.42]Is this Mario Odyssey?
[103:50.30]No, it is not.
[103:52.16]I don't have a funny hat with eyes that turns people into my personal slaves and makes them do things against their will.
[104:03.49]Sorry.
[104:04.21]I'm playing a good-natured game.
[104:06.41]Not like a I take over your mind and you do whatever I say mind control game.
[104:12.16]I don't like that.
[104:16.44]They really fucked up Mario a lot, huh?
[104:22.20]It's a wholesome game.
[104:27.26]Following Molecalypse's ecliptic directions, many of which involve borrowing farm animals, you arrive at the edge of a vast and lonely lake.
[104:38.51]There, you uncover a cave entrance blocked by a stone door.
[104:45.31]That's pretty fucked up.
[104:48.53]We must seek out Ira of the Vale, in the underneath, the bard had explained as you followed a frightened cow around the previous night.
[104:56.77]Continue.
[104:58.83]The bespectacled... The bespectacled?
[105:03.01]Is that a word?
[105:05.03]The bespectacled?
[105:06.83]Ogre manning the door to the underneath doesn't look up from his book as you approach.
[105:13.88]Ten food items per entry.
[105:17.80]Rubbery!
[105:18.90]If you're trying to hustle us, sir, I'll have you know that I can shoot lightning from my fingertips.
[105:24.49]Times are hard for us, ma'am.
[105:26.13]You'll see when you get in there.
[105:29.89]His voice is bad.
[105:32.81]Give him ten food.
[105:33.53]Let's do it.
[105:35.83]The ogre places his book down, and with a mighty push, the stone door rolls open.
[105:40.94]You'll lose ten food.
[105:42.82]A narrow tunnel takes you deep below the Earth, opening into a vast limestone cavern.
[105:48.10]Twinkling on the edge of an underground lake lies a small shanty town, red lanterns lining the quiet streets.
[105:55.29]Malaklis leads on.
[105:57.53]Welcome to the underneath, coin slave.
[105:59.91]Since that bothersome empire edict, we've had to hide away in places like this.
[106:05.28]This used to be quite the hub of activity.
[106:07.24]But now... I guess the Empire is increasing its forces.
[106:12.92]A few mages eye you suspiciously as they pass by.
[106:19.67]Find Ira.
[106:21.09]Enter the Devil's Ears Tavern.
[106:22.41]Peruse the stores.
[106:26.67]Let's go to the tavern.
[106:30.83]Alright, we're gonna talk to the eyeball.
[106:58.46]The creature watches you approach with interest.
[107:00.66]A smile breaks out in the knotted flesh at its base.
[107:07.08]Would you care to dance, small one?
[107:11.81]Uh... Ask what it is.
[107:17.21]The creature chuckles and the fleshy tendrils on its underbelly shake heartily.
[107:22.86]The creature's eye is so large that it is difficult to tell whether it is looking at you or somewhere behind you.
[107:31.61]Dance.
[107:33.41]It is a slow, circling dance, the creature humming an old harvest song all the while.
[107:39.39]After some indeterminate amount of time, the dance ends.
[107:45.14]Ah, that took me back to my youth.
[107:49.13]The creature's eye is so large that you can't tell if he's looking at you or somewhere.
[107:52.93]That was it?
[107:53.81]Alright.
[107:57.11]Ask to trade.
[108:00.68]This is an item that I kept from the last warrior I ate.
[108:04.74]It regurgitates an item onto the floor with a clatter.
[108:16.59]Grr!
[108:17.65]Grr!
[108:21.31]Let's get it.
[108:23.65]That's it?
[108:27.99]That's it.
[108:30.53]A Warrior's Axe.
[108:32.49]What would you offer in return?
[108:35.95]No!
[108:36.29]What?
[108:37.21]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[108:39.09]I don't want to give this.
[108:41.48]I need this item.
[108:42.34]I need this one.
[108:43.10]I don't... I... I can't... I don't want to do... How do I delete this?
[108:49.80]I'm giving this guy a legendary artifact.
[109:00.72]This is literally nothing I can do.
[109:11.77]It inspects the equipment.
[109:13.71]Yes, this will be a lovely addition to my collection.
[109:30.25]You want to trade again?
[109:34.25]My stomach is only so large.
[109:36.03]That was all I could carry around today.
[109:38.67]I plan to do a spot of shopping later.
[109:44.88]We can't do a take back?
[109:50.92]Do I have to use that item?
[109:55.51]Your lightsaber will make a fine addition to my collection.
[109:59.24]Let's go to the ogres.
[110:00.49]Can I not win?
[110:06.87]The ogres are arguing joyfully about winnings.
[110:11.25]They seem to be caught up in some kind of dice gambling game.
[110:13.45]That has to play.
[110:19.85]The largest ogre throws you the dice and pulls out a shimmering scroll containing the blessing you're playing for.
[110:26.74]Second wind.
[110:31.02]Roll 18 and this spell scroll will grant... And this spelled scroll will grant to you.
[110:39.79]This game is not... I mean, 18.
[110:43.89]I don't... Is that even possible?
[110:49.69]That game's... This is not... This is impossible.
[110:51.72]Three die?
[110:58.08]I don't know about this.
[111:00.51]That's impossible.
[111:01.13]This game's not fair.
[111:03.81]The ogres bristle.
[111:04.89]One grips his club menacingly.
[111:07.11]As he rises to his height of two men, you are quickly reminded that you are dealing with ogres here.
[111:19.65]Um... Let's buy a round.
[111:24.59]As the ogres sink their drinks, they warm to you.
[111:27.77]The dealer reduces the dice gambit by two.
[111:31.13]Okay.
[111:35.69]Let's do it.
[111:38.09]I need to get 16.
[111:40.01]Come on.
[111:41.43]I don't have any blessings.
[111:42.55]What do you mean?
[111:43.09]What?
[111:44.73]Oh, god.
[111:45.71]All I've done is lost shit.
[111:51.61]Oh, my fucking god.
[111:52.75]I didn't do anything.
[111:53.93]All I did was lose everything.
[112:01.09]Let's peruse the stores.
[112:05.43]Among the abandoned stalls, you find an ancient-looking shopfront.
[112:09.13]Through red lantern light, you read, Lelot's Oddments, Used Stones, Directions.
[112:15.67]There are also signs pointing out a path to curses and blessings.
[112:20.90]Enter Lelot's Oddments.
[112:23.62]Malaklip sniffs and backs away.
[112:25.52]I'm not allowed in there after I stole all those stupid pebbles.
[112:28.78]He lets you go on ahead.
[112:31.91]With a jangle, you enter the dusty store.
[112:33.95]You find it filled with shells, baskets, glass cases, with rocks of varying shapes and sizes.
[112:40.51]The wise and shopkeeper, Leelot, peers over the counter at you.
[112:46.34]Why would you take, uh, inquire about these stones?
[112:50.90]Leelot lights up at the suggestion.
[112:53.38]He waves his wrinkled hand at his wares.
[112:55.28]You see baskets of giant boulders, smooth pebbles, and tucked away in the corner, a basket of rings.
[113:03.21]I don't have any money.
[113:04.87]What would you like to buy?
[113:05.61]Everything is 20 gold.
[113:07.93]Oh, goddammit.
[113:08.67]What about directions?
[113:11.61]Where's the nearest fight?
[113:13.96]Leelot peers at the map, dusting parts with his shaking, freckled hands.
[113:18.26]No blood will be shed around these pots today.
[113:19.94]A terrible shame.
[113:20.78]Alright.
[113:23.50]Return to the town center.
[113:25.59]Let's go find Ira.
[113:26.45]God.
[113:29.67]God.
[113:35.11]Whatever, Molocalypse leads the way through the dim, lonely streets to Iris' house.
[113:38.83]You can hear screaming coming from within.
[113:40.49]A woman in robes adorned with silver ornaments greets you at the door.
[113:46.82]Merc said you would come begging for help.
[113:49.00]Regardless, you are late.
[113:53.30]Molocalypse bows with a grin.
[113:54.93]I have an illness.
[113:57.21]I'm hoping to purchase a cure.
[114:00.10]Ira of the Vale frowns for a bit, before nodding and letting you into her house.
[114:05.02]You enter the sitting room, and the source of the wailing is made clear.
[114:08.94]A man is locked in a cage, crying in fevered agony.
[114:13.03]Sores of corruption fester on his body.
[114:16.27]Without warning, she opens the cage, and the man rushes at you.
[114:19.27]But with surprising strength, Ira subdues the mad, writhing creature.
[114:24.50]This is the mage Cohen.
[114:26.44]He thought he could fight off the corruption, but he could not.
[114:30.26]Abra watches Monocalypse carefully as Cohen's cries get more and more guttural.
[114:35.41]What should I do with him?
[114:37.21]The bard looks away, disgust and fear on his face.
[114:40.07]He appears close to passing out.
[114:43.01]She nods before turning to you.
[114:45.98]What will you do?
[114:51.28]You gotta kill him.
[114:54.98]You gotta smash this guy's head open, right?
[114:57.80]Take him out, kill the mage.
[114:59.24]As Ira holds him down, you end the mage's life.
[115:02.88]With that dealt with, Ira begins tinkering at a table strewn with dead and shiny things.
[115:07.22]That's it?
[115:08.00]We're just gonna move on?
[115:10.03]Okay, let's hold him down and let's murder him.
[115:13.01]Let's continue the conversation.
[115:15.03]I do have a cure, but as you know, nothing comes free with our kind.
[115:19.11]She taps silver dust from a bottle.
[115:22.50]Save the stolen mage children for me and I will give you the cure.
[115:28.00]Got it.
[115:31.45]Those empire bastards have taken them to some walled fort in the docks of the city.
[115:36.71]And you better hurry.
[115:39.07]That illness can't be held at bay for much longer, I'd wager.
[115:42.69]The bard avoids her gaze.
[115:46.25]What's the illness?
[115:48.37]He hasn't told you.
[115:49.67]Then it's not my place to say.
[115:51.53]But know this, friend of Metalocalypse.
[115:54.09]If he doesn't find a cure soon, you're in grave danger.
[115:58.66]Nonsense!
[115:59.64]No, that's not his voice.
[116:00.62]Nonsense!
[116:03.82]Okay.
[116:05.68]So he's, like, sick.
[116:06.88]He's gonna turn into a monster.
[116:08.48]Let's leave.
[116:11.52]Uh, well.
[116:13.48]Ira of the Vale finds you again just as you begin your ascent.
[116:17.89]Mal?
[116:19.05]The bard turns around.
[116:20.59]You catch a glimpse of hope in his eyes.
[116:23.19]She avoids his gaze.
[116:25.05]Take the children to the madmen near Fort Forstford.
[116:29.33]They run an orphanage.
[116:30.69]I fear it is no longer safe here.
[116:34.81]The villages burn.
[116:37.57]What?
[116:44.27]What did I do?
[116:49.60]I think I lost.
[116:54.30]Well, we got the stolen ones.
[117:00.43]Okay.
[117:03.51]Well, don't give the legendary weapon to a floating eyeball.
[117:09.95]Alright, let's go.
[117:10.59]Let's do it again.
[117:15.03]The stolen ones.
[117:17.22]What can I remove here?
[117:21.41]Lost boy sucks.
[117:26.17]Deep water is fine.
[117:27.51]I lost the fucking hammer.
[117:32.20]God damn it.
[117:32.78]Alright, what about equipment?
[117:33.50]Did I get anything new?
[117:37.82]What did I get new?
[117:42.30]No, I got nothing new.
[117:43.08]Alright, let's do it again.
[117:46.18]I'm not going to fuck up this time.
[117:51.22]Now we touch on the true aspects of heroism.
[117:54.46]This story can begin with your irrelevance, but it cannot end in that fashion.
[117:59.52]Okay, let's do it.
[118:00.66]Come on.
[118:02.42]I did get the next step of that quest, though.
[118:04.26]I am so much more of this world than ever I was.
[118:07.44]He will take this weapon.
[118:10.68]Don't lose it.
[118:12.80]Don't lose that weapon and get 20 fame.
[118:16.38]Goodbye.
[118:16.94]Alright, we're going to go same deal.
[118:25.57]May the gods sacrifice your soul.
[118:27.83]Okay, we're gonna go... Same deal.
[118:30.79]Market Thief.
[118:32.31]Market Bazaar is a hive of activity.
[118:33.75]Traders from across the lands call to pass or buy to sell their wares.
[118:37.47]As the sun beats down on the crowded street, you pause to drink from a fountain.
[118:41.49]Somebody steals something from you, and you have to go get it back.
[118:47.42]You can see him run through the crowd.
[118:50.08]God damn it.
[119:06.08]Raider's ambush.
[119:07.11]Turn the eyeball again.
[119:16.85]Double down.
[119:18.59]A rustling behind you is all the money you get that your life is in danger.
[119:21.31]Your turn is the cords of a northern bolla wrap around your body.
[119:26.88]A party of northerners charges at you as you break free.
[119:29.84]Let's go.
[119:36.88]No, I can't restart.
[119:37.82]We got it.
[119:38.18]We're gonna do this one.
[119:39.02]It's gonna be fine.
[119:43.50]These guys are different.
[119:45.84]Trapper.
[119:46.86]On the frozen plains, prey are few and far between.
[119:49.34]The keen eyes of a trapper see all.
[119:51.56]Trappers throw hunting traps that snare their targets.
[119:54.31]Use evade to avoid traps or change move direction rapidly to break free.
[120:00.45]Okay.
[120:04.58]It's that easy, folks.
[120:06.44]It's that easy, folks.
[120:07.98]Let's get rid of these guys first.
[120:15.47]I need to riposte.
[120:22.58]Actually, let's get up there.
[120:24.00]Smash somebody.
[120:29.86]Two down.
[120:32.44]Wow, okay.
[120:33.42]I thought the dome... Whatever.
[120:34.60]I thought the hit would be right in the face.
[120:42.16]See ya.
[120:47.70]That's a very, very good tactic if you... Guys, tactic?
[120:51.66]Riposte.
[120:52.96]It's very, very effective.
[121:03.29]Hey, Billy Uppercut Zero, thanks for the $15.
[121:06.35]Zapple.
[121:07.97]I wouldn't if I could.
[121:09.74]If I could try.
[121:10.66]But thank you for the $15, man.
[121:13.86]Much appreciated.
[121:16.90]Billy Uppercut Zero.
[121:19.41]With the Raiders defeated, you contemplate your next move.
[121:21.97]Search for spoils.
[121:22.67]Oh, God.
[121:24.59]Paint.
[121:29.07]God damn it.
[121:30.03]Fucking shit.
[121:30.90]I was about to scream.
[121:32.86]I seriously thought that was... Hold on.
[121:39.92]It said he grabs me and stabs me, but I bleed gold apparently.
[121:45.69]Arm wrestling.
[121:46.35]I need to make some money.
[121:53.19]In the second round of the competition, you sit opposite the aged frame of Huntly Toothless.
[122:02.72]He boasts about once being a silencer for the Thieves Guild.
[122:07.90]Gotta roll more than a 12.
[122:12.05]Oh shit in my face.
[122:23.18]god damn it the haggard x hitman appears to know some type of hand grip that numbs your muscles you're defeated after being knocked out in the second round you receive only a small prize hey that's better than nothing you take the lesser reward for losing in the competition of strength when you return a new contest will begin so cards have multiple tiers in them and that's really awesome I like that a lot
[122:51.21]I have one food.
[122:52.07]Alright, I need food.
[122:53.69]Buy food.
[122:56.63]Three food?
[122:57.43]Haha.
[122:58.41]Gains?
[122:58.97]Bah.
[123:01.67]He has... I gotta buy three.
[123:03.23]I have to.
[123:03.54]I won't be able to keep walking.
[123:08.94]Thanks.
[123:09.58]I don't have any equipment, right?
[123:12.10]Hahaha.
[123:15.97]I sold this fucking thing.
[123:17.86]That was such a mistake.
[123:18.82]Alright, let's go.
[123:22.22]Sell the hammer.
[123:23.04]Alright, here we go.
[123:25.88]Tarts, pies, and exotic lies.
[123:27.55]Uh, wait, it doesn't even matter.
[123:32.97]I can't buy anything.
[123:33.63]I have zero gold.
[123:34.67]Alright, well, that's great.
[123:36.16]Alright, what about this card?
[123:38.66]Distressed damsel.
[123:43.07]Please help.
[123:43.91]I've been robbed by a band of thugs.
[123:45.37]Anything?
[123:45.73]Yes.
[123:46.19]Assist?
[123:46.77]I need 14.
[123:47.47]Um, I've been pretty lucky with the dice.
[123:52.45]Okay, 11.
[123:54.41]All I need.
[123:54.97]Just, come on.
[123:59.33]Thank god.
[124:05.37]thank you the woman says as you help her from the carriage please accept this as a token of my gratitude free food two supply cards got fame and we got food thank you we're okay the king's road with the next town homes let's continue to the next village dusk falls as you continue on your quest
[124:34.42]A village burns.
[124:37.61]You arrive... Oh.
[124:39.35]You arrive at Braden at dusk to find it under attack from raiders.
[124:46.27]As the village burns, three brave farmers attempt to defend the last of the surviving villagers.
[124:51.79]One calls out, Please help!
[124:54.22]We must stop these savages before all is lost!
[124:57.24]You draw your weapon and rush to their aid.
[124:58.60]Yeah.
[125:10.85]I need better armor.
[125:13.63]Oh boy, there's a lot of people here actually.
[125:17.21]Oh shit.
[125:19.38]Come on, get the nail out of the socket!
[125:20.94]They're gonna wiggle out the screw.
[125:34.69]I get rid of you.
[125:35.47]You fucking suck.
[125:36.83]Die.
[125:42.42]The guy with the bola.
[125:44.12]Gotta go.
[125:44.58]Could use a better weapon, too.
[125:49.48]This thing sucks.
[125:52.46]Did I lose anybody?
[125:54.10]No, no, no, no.
[125:54.62]I don't want to lose anybody.
[125:58.03]Shit.
[125:58.23]Did I lose one guy?
[125:58.89]I may have.
[126:00.51]I think one guy died.
[126:04.41]Oh, well.
[126:05.13]I think I got...
[126:13.16]I think I did okay.
[126:19.38]You probably get something for more people being alive.
[126:23.15]You gain a community armor.
[126:24.71]Okay, soldier's sword.
[126:25.67]It's better than the piece of shit that I currently have, so yes.
[126:32.37]The surviving villagers rush to their farmer's aides and tend their wounds.
[126:38.18]Ahem.
[126:40.05]Thank you, hero.
[126:41.39]You've saved our people, but sadly our village is no more.
[126:44.63]Please accept this small token as our gratitude.
[126:46.59]Alright, fucking stop doing Kermit the Frog.
[126:50.61]For saving all the peasants you get for fame.
[126:53.99]And a bunch of food.
[126:59.67]It's not time to celebrate.
[127:01.01]They're surely must... Don't do it again.
[127:04.23]It's not time to celebrate.
[127:05.25]They're surely mustering to raid the town of Taran.
[127:10.43]They point further south down the riverbank.
[127:13.59]If you're our true hero, you will surely save them.
[127:17.56]With another village lost to the northerners, you seek out Ray Romano for the next town.
[127:26.58]So there's the end of that one.
[127:27.46]Pop or play?
[127:29.24]So here we go.
[127:35.41]The town crier announces the Empire seeks mercenaries to join the battle against corruption.
[127:39.55]You seek out the watchtower where the recruitment is taking place.
[127:44.93]You arrive in time to hear Sir Malifowl's plan to wipe out the pauper's district.
[127:50.79]The outbreak began there and we cannot risk sparing any of their lives.
[127:56.16]Sir Malifal the Green leads the mercenaries to the pauper district where the poor and sick have been walled off from the rest of the city.
[128:03.32]As you hear the wailing of the corrupted, Sir Malifal gives his command to charge.
[128:14.53]Uh... I don't know.
[128:20.41]This is some Warcraft 3 flashbacks here.
[128:22.69]Frozen Throne shit.
[128:25.19]I'm gonna refuse to kill them.
[128:27.79]Your refusal does not sit well with the Imperial soldiers, traitor!
[128:32.43]One of them shouts.
[128:34.80]Imperial soldiers surround you, shackles at the ready.
[128:39.12]You draw your weapon and prepare for their wrath.
[128:41.78]Heavy weapons are recommended against Empire.
[128:43.58]You can change equipment in the inventory.
[128:45.04]Well, I don't have that, so... I guess I have, like, a shitty axe, right?
[128:51.95]Let's put the axe on.
[129:06.61]Mr. Mustard Musket?
[129:07.77]What does that guy got?
[129:10.75]These guys have mustard?
[129:14.63]Musketeer.
[129:15.21]There's a lot of new enemy types.
[129:18.78]Deadly at a distance, only the most skilled are recruited into musketry.
[129:22.82]Musketeers fire heavy attacks.
[129:24.24]Defend with a shield, else evade for your life.
[129:28.54]All I heard was kill those guys first.
[129:31.30]Oh, it's only these guys.
[129:38.06]Whoa, they're shooting off screen.
[129:44.78]Whoa, whoa!
[129:53.47]Anybody shooting?
[129:53.99]Anybody shooting?
[129:54.75]Nobody?
[129:55.15]Nobody?
[130:05.00]Not this time.
[130:05.94]Right in the back.
[130:20.93]Got him.
[130:25.56]Moon aim?
[130:26.28]These guys do have moon aim.
[130:34.97]Fearful of your wrath, the rest of the soldiers retreat.
[130:38.37]You spot a peasant woman with a child hiding behind some barrels.
[130:42.17]You lead them past the wall, past gatekeepers who look pointedly in other directions.
[130:48.35]Bless your heart, she says, holding back tears.
[130:51.63]Please accept this token of our appreciation.
[130:55.56]Okay, I got a little bit of fame and I got a lot of food.
[130:57.40]I have a lot of food now.
[131:01.62]The Stolen Ones.
[131:03.05]This is the third part of the companion quest, right?
[131:16.39]You linger near a fort in the abandoned docks of the great city.
[131:20.56]Malacalypse silds... I think that's slides.
[131:24.34]Malacalypse...
[131:26.50]Mala?
[131:28.14]Mela?
[131:28.60]How do you say this, guys?
[131:30.08]Maloclips?
[131:30.98]Maloclips?
[131:31.70]Maloclips.
[131:32.76]Slides out of an alley and strokes his mustache.
[131:36.10]Well, Coinslave, the Empire has stolen the mage children hidden away in there.
[131:40.99]They have them in there.
[131:43.23]Now, I'm not fond of children, as you well know.
[131:46.69]You recall a time when Maloclips was asked to relinquish his last sweet roll to a crying child.
[131:53.03]He refused.
[131:54.72]But Ira won't give me the cure if we don't rescue them.
[131:58.59]He outlines the plan to you.
[132:00.09]It is worryingly brief.
[132:02.31]These forts are all interconnected.
[132:04.43]So even if we defeat one lot of guards, they're bound to call reinforcements.
[132:08.95]We'll have to get in and get out quick.
[132:13.15]Defeat two steel monster crabs within 60 seconds.
[132:18.05]Defeat monster crabs.
[132:19.67]Another monster crab.
[132:22.38]Okay, got it.
[132:23.60]Whileocalypse has drawn a helpful diagram in the dirt, the self-portrait is particularly generous.
[132:29.80]Find a way in.
[132:30.42]Ask about the plan again.
[132:31.20]Ask why the Empire would kidnap Maeve.
[132:32.80]Find a way in.
[132:35.28]Holy shit.
[132:38.88]I have no idea.
[132:40.26]And they're all huge failures, except for this one.
[132:42.08]It's either three or one.
[132:45.76]I think it's on this side.
[132:46.94]I'm pretty sure it's three.
[132:57.93]I thought it was three.
[133:02.37]Yep.
[133:03.09]Got it.
[133:03.63]Thank God.
[133:06.41]Hidden beneath a pile of refuse, you find a grate that leads, presumably, under the fort.
[133:13.88]Without considering your wishes, Malocalypse wedges the grate open and descends into the gloom.
[133:19.38]You follow suit, as you don't quite trust him on his own.
[133:23.08]The rough stone walls of the narrow passageway grate against your skin as you feel your way through the sewers.
[133:28.37]You stumble blindly into Melanclips' body and clumsily plunge into the water.
[133:36.49]The commotion rouses a group of corrupted creatures taking refuge in the sewers.
[133:40.91]They don't take kindly to your intrusion.
[133:44.45]Alright, well let's fuck him up.
[133:51.71]Refuse him.
[133:56.48]Just one guy.
[133:57.46]One Terra.
[133:58.66]One Terra of the deep.
[133:59.60]Might as well just take this because it's free.
[134:05.73]Smash that shit off his back.
[134:14.37]Take off his head.
[134:15.43]Easy.
[134:16.75]Easy money.
[134:20.39]Easy money.
[134:26.92]The final monstrosity falls, gurgling.
[134:30.58]Malacalypse gazes at the bodies with a troubled look on his face.
[134:33.79]Well, apparently we're on drugs.
[134:36.69]Because there was only one guy.
[134:38.77]This one is wearing a necklace.
[134:40.65]Looks like a family heirloom.
[134:42.91]The bard, usually fond of looting and stealing, doesn't allow you to touch the necklace.
[134:47.88]Huh.
[134:50.62]You peer up at the access tunnel.
[134:52.94]It is set too high into the wall.
[134:54.66]You won't be able to go back that way.
[134:58.44]Explore the sewers.
[135:05.11]Oh god dammit!
[135:07.95]No!
[135:11.67]How many of these 75% fucking chances am I going to not... You peer up at the access tunnel.
[135:22.52]It is set too high into the wall.
[135:24.16]You won't be able to go back that way.
[135:32.04]It's this one.
[135:37.06]Milocalypse beckons you to a wrought iron gate.
[135:39.84]If I'm not mistaken, and I never am, how dare you question me?
[135:43.90]This will take us directly into the fort.
[135:46.82]He allows you to go first.
[135:49.32]You leave the moisture and murk of the sewers behind you.
[135:52.80]You find yourself in a cellar.
[135:54.28]There are wine caskets, jars of pickled vegetables, and a sizable iron cage wreathed in pulsing light.
[136:01.55]Within the cage, the missing mage children huddle, unsure of your intentions.
[136:06.79]Malacalypse reaches for the heavy lock upon the cage's gate.
[136:10.34]It sizzles, and he drops it quickly.
[136:12.70]Yaiyo!
[136:13.38]By Frida's skirts!
[136:14.36]That burns!
[136:15.92]He presses a long metal implement into your hand and steps back.
[136:19.50]You tentatively touch the lock.
[136:21.80]It doesn't burn you.
[136:24.37]You attempt to pick the lock.
[136:26.94]What the fuck is this?
[136:28.48]What is this?
[136:29.50]What is this?
[136:33.37]Oh.
[136:36.71]Um... What... What do I need to do?
[136:41.55]Do I need to hit the gold one?
[136:43.49]The blue?
[136:45.11]He didn't tell me what to do here.
[136:46.39]I'm gonna... Is it gold?
[136:52.67]Gold.
[136:54.51]Nicely timed.
[137:00.55]We don't go for just a general success.
[137:02.63]We go for the fucking gold.
[137:05.55]Don't you guys, you know that game at the arcade where you drop the cubes down and you have to make a tower of cubes?
[137:11.59]You know how many times I've gotten past that first line and won the grand prize?
[137:16.19]It's a thing I do to show off when I go to Dave & Buster's.
[137:20.07]I'm that guy.
[137:21.35]I'm the guy that walks by and goes, you know, you pretend like you don't really care about the machine.
[137:25.87]You look at it, you're like, oh, what's that?
[137:27.15]The cube drop?
[137:28.11]The tower cube machine thing?
[137:30.43]Oh, yeah.
[137:31.39]Maybe I'll give it a try.
[137:33.53]I'm kind of good at stuff like this.
[137:35.41]But they don't know.
[137:35.95]They don't know that I'm a fucking master at that shit.
[137:40.48]And I destroy it perfectly every time.
[137:42.74]And all the people are cheering.
[137:44.96]They're like, whoa!
[137:47.21]How could you do something that was fucking awesome?
[137:49.13]And I'm like, I don't know, you know, whatever.
[137:52.49]With a click, the lock pops open and clatters to the floor.
[137:55.65]Malacalypse shouts triumphantly.
[137:57.27]Waited 100 years for my revenge.
[138:01.58]It appears I must wait 100 more.
[138:04.20]Shouts triumphantly and swings the door open.
[138:06.24]Shaking, one of the older children pipes up.
[138:09.40]Excuse me?
[138:11.42]Malacalypse crosses his arms at the lack of applause.
[138:14.42]The girl continues, eyes wide with fear.
[138:17.84]I can enchant the scouts with the spell of befuddlement.
[138:22.96]That will buy us some time.
[138:25.11]The child pulls out a small worn notebook she draws from its power.
[138:29.31]Defeat two steel monster crabs within 90 seconds.
[138:34.29]Okay, children.
[138:37.40]Your mother and I are going to go kill the bad men.
[138:39.92]You stay here.
[138:41.32]Unless we die, in which case you're on your own.
[138:44.16]The children nod, numb with terror.
[138:47.35]You sneak up the stairs and survey the scene before you.
[138:49.57]The soldiers mill about the fort's courtyard.
[138:52.99]Moloch Lips draws his spellbook.
[138:55.33]I have an incantation that will covertly teleport a few soldiers far away from here, potentially to their deaths.
[139:01.55]But I'll require some of your blood.
[139:06.65]Now fight this.
[139:07.47]I can kill these guys in 90 seconds.
[139:09.81]You don't need to do, like, blood magic.
[139:14.47]You stride into the courtyard and draw your weapon.
[139:20.50]Shouts of intruder echo around the fort.
[139:26.29]We don't need to do the blood magic cheats.
[139:28.23]We got this.
[139:30.71]It's gonna bury an axe in these guys faces and I don't even matter.
[139:34.37]Although the axe does suck.
[139:35.54]Well, there's a lot of people here.
[139:36.54]Defeat them all.
[139:37.32]Oh boy.
[139:40.68]Oh, he hit like shot me in the head.
[139:42.32]Oh god, I'm gonna lose.
[139:51.83]It takes a lot longer than I thought.
[140:02.17]Die!
[140:03.34]Oh my god, this axe is so bad.
[140:04.58]I might not do it.
[140:17.83]Come on!
[140:19.74]I don't have time for this shit.
[140:25.11]Alright, we're good.
[140:28.95]What am I talking about?
[140:29.59]I was fine.
[140:34.51]I was scared for no reason.
[140:44.76]The bard sucks.
[140:46.36]He's alright.
[140:48.76]Nicely done.
[140:49.28]Now onward, children!
[140:50.82]Malacalypse leads.
[141:07.01]Covertly, the children onto a covered barge by the docks.
[141:10.93]Onward to your new home with the madmen of Frostfold.
[141:14.72]The children glance at you in alarm as they meekly duck into the boat.
[141:17.62]You gain four fame.
[141:20.92]Nice.
[141:22.64]Nice.
[141:23.14]Whoa!
[141:25.48]What the hell happened to the channel?
[141:28.86]Did I just get like 2,000 fucking people?
[141:30.28]Holy shit.
[141:30.99]What happened?
[141:34.69]What happened?
[141:38.05]Did somebody raid the channel?
[141:42.29]Is somebody hosting me or something?
[141:45.81]Oh, Admiral!
[141:46.87]Holy shit.
[141:51.20]Wow.
[141:51.92]Thanks, dude.
[141:53.34]Thanks for the host.
[141:55.74]There's like 3,000 people that just came from Admiral's channel.
[142:03.25]Uh, that's... Thanks, man.
[142:05.92]Hopefully... Are you playing this game, too?
[142:07.64]Are you here?
[142:10.32]Admiral Bafrou!
[142:11.80]Bafrou!
[142:13.80]I love, like, butchering people's fucking names, by the way.
[142:18.63]Uh, thanks a lot, man.
[142:20.09]Hi, guys.
[142:20.87]My name's Jerma985.
[142:23.19]I'm a fucking loser.
[142:25.39]I don't know why he hosted me.
[142:27.61]What is the point of this?
[142:29.64]No, thanks, guys.
[142:30.94]Hello.
[142:32.20]We're going to continue to play.
[142:38.02]Leave while you still can.
[142:39.26]Let's keep going.
[142:46.81]Low quality.
[142:50.21]Oh, he's gonna get stage fright.
[142:55.21]Well, not gonna get stage fright.
[142:56.45]There was already like 2,000.
[142:57.07]There was like 25 people here.
[143:00.10]There was 25 times 2,000 here.
[143:02.92]I'm alright.
[143:04.64]Anyways, we got ambushed again.
[143:06.72]Wrestling behind you is all the warning you get that your life is in danger.
[143:09.46]You turn and there's a bunch of northern men.
[143:13.20]A lot of them, apparently.
[143:20.43]Yeah, 25,000 chickens.
[143:27.61]Alright, let's do it.
[143:30.41]Whoops, I missed.
[143:36.15]I gotta take out the bola guys first.
[143:38.99]Oh, wait, I can't, um... Oh, I can't riposte.
[143:42.53]That's not good.
[143:45.17]I gotta take this axe out.
[143:48.34]I need to put the sword back on so I can actually... Because there's a lot of northerners now, right?
[143:51.22]I have to deal with the northern men.
[143:54.14]Oh, I can't double tap?
[143:59.79]Where's, uh, where's Celebrimbor?
[144:01.27]I'm used to being able to do that.
[144:13.69]Yep.
[144:17.86]One more Bolo guy?
[144:18.54]No, two.
[144:20.14]Don't you love how I said, kill the Bolo guys first?
[144:23.16]And I only killed one.
[144:24.30]I left the other two standing.
[144:34.09]Dead.
[144:37.61]Hi, new viewer.
[144:38.27]Welcome to Simple Jerm of Phrases.
[144:40.39]Today's phrase can be used... Wait, what?
[144:45.87]Losing people fast.
[144:49.94]That's fucking funny.
[144:51.88]With the Raiders defeated, you contemplate your next move.
[144:54.04]Search for spoils.
[144:56.38]Gain, gain.
[144:56.98]Alright, I want the first gain.
[144:59.78]Got it.
[145:01.38]Fucking... Why am I so bad at this?
[145:05.44]I was 100% confident that that was going to be a gain.
[145:09.32]What a fucking idiot.
[145:12.22]I just pressed A immediately because I was certain.
[145:16.74]As you search for valuables, one of the northerners spits in your face and you fucking die and you take five health.
[145:21.61]Okay.
[145:26.01]This again, I can do this.
[145:27.37]This is the damsel.
[145:28.21]You go over to the cart.
[145:31.11]You gotta shake some dice.
[145:32.17]You gotta play Yahtzee and she gives you free stuff.
[145:34.75]Okay, well we're definitely gonna redo the two.
[145:40.09]And we got it.
[145:40.83]No, we didn't.
[145:41.25]What?
[145:42.41]Recount that.
[145:42.97]Five, ten...
[145:49.35]Now I get ambushed.
[145:50.23]Fuck.
[145:52.64]Alright.
[145:56.82]Well, at least I can practice my swinging.
[145:59.16]I should have re-rolled the three.
[146:05.79]I... I know.
[146:07.55]What a moron.
[146:11.31]It's alright.
[146:11.89]Pyromaniac.
[146:20.67]Get out of the way, the dancer's in the way.
[146:22.58]I don't like the dancing guy.
[146:23.90]What's his name, the magician?
[146:27.96]They gotta get these guys easier names to say.
[146:32.62]This guy's name is Malocalypse.
[146:36.08]He should be like Dan.
[146:37.04]Hey, that guy just stepped on his own grenade.
[146:51.17]Valeria.
[146:56.25]Dan the man.
[146:56.85]No, Dan the bard.
[146:57.67]Easy.
[147:00.74]It's actually not, like, terrible to do it that way because... I'm gonna... Am I gonna get money here or food?
[147:07.74]No, I gotta roll for, uh... I gotta roll to see if I get a six.
[147:11.37]Give me a break.
[147:13.69]No, no, no, no, no.
[147:14.27]I wanna go back.
[147:15.23]I didn't wanna roll this.
[147:16.51]I wanted to roll them both.
[147:18.95]I accidentally...
[147:21.63]Now the power is yours to use.
[147:22.77]It appears you are worthy to wield the weapon of champions.
[147:24.67]The raiders will hide from you no longer.
[147:48.87]You know what?
[147:49.65]Here's what it is.
[147:51.82]X is continue in this game.
[147:54.10]It's kind of odd.
[147:57.22]Pressing X is normally where A would be.
[148:00.54]I would think back.
[148:01.42]I don't know.
[148:02.28]I'm making up excuses.
[148:03.88]But I wanted to roll the second one and I accidentally pressed X and that's continue.
[148:10.25]Whatever.
[148:10.55]Maybe the X is upside down.
[148:32.31]The Sanctum is now there.
[148:33.55]Remembering the Elder of Talos' instructions, you set out toward the Sanctum of the Shaman.
[148:38.07]Locate and defeat the Shaman.
[148:55.87]But first, look at this new card.
[148:58.55]Deepwater.
[149:00.47]While crossing the stone bridge, you suddenly find yourself confronted by a villainous band.
[149:10.89]Let's go into the river.
[149:12.11]Let's actually try to leap into the river this time.
[149:13.63]I want to see what the other one is.
[149:15.13]You dive over the side of the bridge just in time, plunging into the cold water.
[149:19.55]We just have to do an 11.
[149:23.21]Okay.
[149:24.47]This is where select, select, re-roll.
[149:26.21]Oh.
[149:26.27]My.
[149:26.35]God.
[149:26.49]God damn it.
[149:26.81]Well, that was fun.
[149:28.01]I have this equipped, right?
[149:28.95]Yes.
[149:51.91]No shield anymore.
[149:57.35]It is as the Talos Elder said.
[150:00.67]The Shaman Sanctum is protected by a magical barrier.
[150:04.31]Best you try that hammer.
[150:07.37]Lift it up and swing it down.
[150:09.74]You raise Frethra's ire above your head and bring it down against the magical wall with all of your might.
[150:15.02]The hammer finds its mark, and you are immediately engulfed in a blizzard of snow and ice.
[150:20.03]The howling winds spin you this way and that, then vanish as quickly as they had appeared.
[150:25.17]Disoriented, you look around for Malacalypse, but he is nowhere to be found.
[150:30.80]You find your bearings and realize you are standing in a forest clearing, covered in newly fallen snow.
[150:36.52]You step back and bump into something.
[150:38.66]Turning, you see a towering northern clansman, bald and brutal.
[150:43.66]He has brute strength, if nothing else.
[150:46.90]He does not flinch, nor seems even the slightest bit interested in you.
[150:51.52]He stands with weapons drawn and brow lowered.
[150:54.66]You turn to follow his gaze.
[150:59.30]Then you see her, sitting on a throne of wicker and thorns, small straw play dead charms and oddities hanging from the trees behind her, before her kneel countless raiders, worshipping their leader in an eerie stillness.
[151:14.79]The defender of villages and the exiled one, the shaman says with a hiss.
[151:21.04]She steps down from her throne.
[151:24.78]I know why you have come.
[151:28.82]Let this end.
[151:33.70]I hope you know how to fight, hero, says the bald northerner calmly.
[151:38.05]There are more warriors here than we can kill.
[151:40.63]To defeat a snake, you must cut off his head.
[151:44.45]You ready your weapon as the shaman and her clansmen surround you.
[151:51.77]Let's go.
[152:00.43]Calmly.
[152:02.60]Yeah, very calm.
[152:06.36]Raid leader Gerda.
[152:07.82]Raid leaders are the front line of the northern assault, centers of tactical and religious guidance.
[152:12.68]The shaman casts spells that heal her allies.
[152:15.77]Attack her quickly to interrupt her spells.
[152:20.07]Come, hero!
[152:22.15]I need to interrupt that spell.
[152:27.10]Alright, where is he?
[152:28.64]Why is there like a fucking Garfield bubble over there?
[152:30.57]Oh wait, hold on, that's him.
[152:33.55]What does he do?
[152:34.01]I don't know what that does.
[152:36.05]Okay, that's cool.
[152:40.31]I'm kind of like losing track.
[152:42.29]What the fuck was that?
[152:43.27]That was awesome.
[152:46.66]Alright, she's gotta go.
[152:51.48]Whoa!
[152:53.32]Oh shit.
[152:55.40]No, shit.
[152:56.36]I'm taking a lot of damage.
[152:57.76]No, she has like a heal.
[153:02.62]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose.
[153:03.52]No, I'm not.
[153:04.44]Be confident.
[153:12.45]She disappears.
[153:14.59]What is this?
[153:14.97]What is this?
[153:15.55]The skull.
[153:15.87]What's wrong with the skull?
[153:16.49]What's happening?
[153:17.79]Oh.
[153:18.75]Just gotta kill her.
[153:21.01]Oh my god.
[153:21.57]Oh my god.
[153:26.58]I got her.
[153:27.92]She just put her head down to get executed.
[153:34.92]She teleported away from me to execute her.
[153:36.88]Okay, that's good.
[153:40.92]The shaman's body writhes as a dark spirit leaves her chest and vanishes into the air.
[153:45.58]The remaining raiders flee into the forest.
[153:49.22]As the skies clear, the sun beams down on the colossal warrior that had fought alongside you.
[153:55.38]I am Coborn.
[153:56.38]I was born into the northern clans, but I am clanless now.
[153:58.56]You do not tell us, but we are always not like this.
[154:00.64]Perhaps one day the clans will return to the tradition we have lost.
[154:03.26]You've befriended Colbjorn, the wanderer.
[154:10.19]Who's talking?
[154:13.83]You and I have cleared a small part of the stain away from my honor this day.
[154:16.13]If you call me, I will answer.
[154:17.37]He reaches out a massive hand and clasps your forearm.
[154:20.69]Let us head back and find your friend.
[154:22.13]And with that, you and Corbo make your way back through the forest in search of Melaklops.
[154:28.07]Another card returns to my deck.
[154:30.21]Do not worry.
[154:30.91]I have more challenges before you get ready to face my foe.
[154:34.77]Minus 300 viewer joke.
[154:35.27]Hey, come on.
[154:41.03]We're defeating the Shaman.
[154:46.00]Armor of Gluttony, Ring of Food, Pious Robes, and Frontier Barbot.
[154:54.56]That's the first new armor we've gotten, so.
[154:58.69]This also is for the Shaman.
[154:59.95]Fame and Shame, Watchtower, Raider's Ambush, and Bridge Skirmish.
[155:07.07]This is for doing the legendary quest.
[155:10.61]You just get to put this in your deck now.
[155:12.47]That's cool.
[155:14.76]For befriending Kolbjorn, Clan Eyebright, and the Wanderer.
[155:20.02]So I have a choice between two companions now.
[155:25.50]For defending all of the villages, Elder's Gift.
[155:29.26]I don't understand.
[155:33.58]Does he give you a new weapon or something?
[155:39.50]For rescuing the mage children.
[155:41.64]The madmen.
[155:44.14]Interesting.
[155:48.97]So... That one is done.
[155:53.09]Do I unlock any others?
[155:53.95]No.
[155:54.13]Complete more challenges to unlock.
[155:55.33]So we can do... The High Priestess.
[155:58.71]The Emperor.
[156:00.29]Let's kind of go in succession here.
[156:01.64]I skipped this one.
[156:03.82]Let's do the High Priestess.
[156:11.11]Okay, the High Priestess.
[156:13.83]Collect blessings in order to enter the ritual house at the summit of the Mount Freitas and negotiate a treaty with the Northerners there.
[156:22.94]So, a tribute.
[156:23.58]Gain blessings to increase your chances of success.
[156:27.90]Do not expect to be welcomed by Northerners while treading in their lands.
[156:33.56]Survive Mount Freitas by restoring life at camp.
[156:39.78]okay so this is interesting can I like I doubt the northerner can offer you anything time will tell bonus dice melee fight what do you mean bonus dice range magic re-spin wheel magic shield bone like what a re-spin wheel
[157:10.24]I don't understand.
[157:13.86]I kind of like the idea of bonus dice.
[157:16.18]And plus, we've been with this guy the whole time, so... Okay, so... I can only put six encounter cards in here.
[157:31.35]Well, I mean, if we have this guy here now, maybe we should start his quest.
[157:37.15]I can't do this one.
[157:37.89]I need Milaclips for this.
[157:39.27]That's cool that you can only pick a card if you can continue the quest line.
[157:42.22]That's awesome.
[157:45.02]I don't know.
[157:45.36]I don't want to put the Tavern in there because this is... Isn't this the one with the... No, I've not seen this one yet.
[157:51.96]I thought this was the one... No, that was like in the hole.
[157:54.94]Ridge Skirmish.
[157:56.42]Fame and Shame.
[157:57.28]There's a lot of cards we haven't seen.
[158:02.56]Man-Eating Tree.
[158:05.97]And...
[158:08.40]Let's do the Old Maiden.
[158:09.88]Why not?
[158:10.18]Let's put this in.
[158:14.89]Let's also put in Winter's Bane.
[158:19.87]Actually, I don't know about this.
[158:22.79]We have to get a... Hold on.
[158:25.97]I don't know what this... Armor of Gluttony.
[158:30.23]Ring of Food.
[158:31.03]I can only take five cards.
[158:35.45]I mean, do I... I think I need fame to wield this, don't I?
[158:41.33]Who gives a shit?
[158:50.69]Um... Do I need... Yeah, you need 20 fame.
[158:56.33]I don't think I want to deal with that right now.
[158:58.22]I'd rather just... Have other options.
[159:03.98]Like... This.
[159:06.66]New shield.
[159:07.22]We'll go with swords this time, right?
[159:10.70]Yeah, whatever.
[159:13.68]Let's give it a try.
[159:18.38]On the onion ring.
[159:19.10]Alright.
[159:19.30]The High Priestess?
[159:29.40]You feel like puking.
[159:30.30]Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[159:31.84]Now it begins.
[159:33.38]Negotiations on behalf of the Empire.
[159:36.11]Alright.
[159:36.93]We will see how that story ends.
[159:38.49]Shit, do I have to keep up that guy's voice?
[159:40.41]He's with me now, right?
[159:42.67]Foothill.
[159:43.83]You are assigned a mission to travel across the northern border on behalf of the Empire.
[159:48.10]General Brandstrom instructs.
[159:50.88]Don't come back until you convince these prisoners.
[159:53.64]Taught to stop ordering raids on our people.
[159:57.39]He gives you supplies to consume on your trek up the mountain.
[160:01.13]Like a bird flew by in the middle of that guy's sentence and distracted him.
[160:05.74]Try to make sure there's no bears around before you set camp.
[160:12.23]That's a lot of food.
[160:15.10]This woman does not take kindly to high Earth stones, so I suggest you find a way to gain their favor.
[160:20.32]He says as he sends you off.
[160:21.48]This guy sucks.
[160:22.14]I blew it.
[160:23.50]I blew this guy like a long time ago.
[160:26.66]Collect at least six blessings before meeting the high priestess.
[160:30.56]Alright.
[160:31.54]One.
[160:32.62]Temple prayers.
[160:33.10]Not every temple has crumbled into the dust.
[160:35.23]More's the pity.
[160:37.07]The Temple of Divine Providence provides blessings in exchange for a simple gold donation.
[160:43.48]Okay, well, I'll make a... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[160:47.11]Hold on, wait.
[160:47.61]What, what, what?
[160:49.85]What are these?
[160:51.51]Six gold, Gambler's Banquet, Gold Zealot, Monk's Vitality, Beggar's Charm, Second Wind.
[160:59.69]Um... Let's go with Beggar's Charm.
[161:07.92]Oh, I can read them.
[161:08.66]Okay, Gambler's Banquet.
[161:11.50]Receive plus 4 food after every dice gambit.
[161:13.84]That's pretty cool.
[161:15.62]Receive plus 15 life for every gold gain card you receive.
[161:20.72]If your max life is less than 150, you may discard food gain or equipment gain to receive plus 5 max health.
[161:28.79]Gain up to 20 gold at the beginning of a new map if you have less than 20 gold.
[161:33.83]And combat boosts life to 75 when life drops below 25.
[161:36.37]Alright, well, let's go with... I mean, this is... Where's the max health one?
[161:41.91]Let's go... No, I already have enough food.
[161:43.49]No, let's go with this.
[161:46.23]Let's go with long life.
[161:50.29]If your max health is less than 150, I can get rid of food cards and get plus 5 max health.
[161:54.57]Let's try this one.
[161:58.91]Uh-huh.
[162:01.27]Oh, thank you.
[162:02.31]You lose 6 gold.
[162:05.78]And down.
[162:08.30]Bridge skirmish.
[162:11.34]As you approach a bridge high in the mountains, you see that it is already occupied.
[162:16.53]From your viewing angle, you notice that the bridge... It's just all fucked up.
[162:21.37]With luck, you may be able to knock out one of the supports with a thrown object, causing the bridge to collapse.
[162:29.49]I don't have any... Throw a rock.
[162:31.91]Will you risk throwing one of your belongings at the bridge or charge... Let's throw... Let's get a big rock and throw it.
[162:37.79]You quickly look around and settle for a hefty stone.
[162:39.91]Alright, here we go.
[162:46.56]Ayayadias mio!
[162:47.78]That was fucking hard.
[162:58.48]Your rock flies into the canyon, alerting the enemies to your presence.
[163:03.44]One-handed weapons are recommended against northerners you can exchange.
[163:08.19]Give me this.
[163:09.21]I don't have it.
[163:10.45]Give me a neglected sword.
[163:11.93]Okay.
[163:14.83]Let's go.
[163:16.67]What are you supposed to do?
[163:19.53]You're supposed to not touch any red and only touch the blue or gold pieces.
[163:28.51]After all that bragging.
[163:29.79]That was so close too.
[163:34.16]Why can't I be this character?
[163:41.44]I'm gonna call him... I'm gonna call him... Colby.
[163:45.53]His family lost, his clan turned against him.
[163:47.99]Colby has traveled south in search of meaning.
[163:50.79]When activated, Colby performs a charging attack that causes stun and may knock down weakened enemies.
[163:55.66]Stay close to charge his ability faster.
[163:58.70]So if I'm, like, near him... Okay, I thought he just stunned... I thought that was a stun to me.
[164:14.15]Execute.
[164:16.55]Execute.
[164:21.61]Combat is so fun.
[164:24.08]What a huge improvement over the last game, for real.
[164:29.94]The last game's combat is not even in the same category as this one.
[164:32.72]It feels so much more fluid.
[164:34.50]It's so much less clunky.
[164:49.62]Just go for it.
[164:52.68]So he charges forward.
[164:53.93]I guess you can't direct him at all, huh?
[164:58.59]It's all good.
[165:02.23]It's a better game.
[165:03.39]Is this for the Nintendo Switch?
[165:04.95]I don't think so.
[165:07.67]I don't even know what platforms this is for.
[165:10.15]I have no idea.
[165:11.83]You search the Fallen for anything of value.
[165:14.00]You gain 4 fame.
[165:16.92]Okay, I can gain discard for max 5 life.
[165:22.36]Side of the portent there.
[165:24.20]Armory, gain equipment.
[165:25.28]I think I... No.
[165:26.28]I want to gain equipment.
[165:28.01]Because I have, like, nothing.
[165:33.03]Bastion of Purification.
[165:34.85]That's better than my wooden baby shield.
[165:38.65]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[165:39.81]Please put that on.
[165:43.00]Again, food.
[165:44.20]Okay, now I will discard this because that's a lot of food and I'd rather get the plus 5 HP.
[165:53.37]Let's take a left.
[165:56.07]Blizzard.
[165:56.83]Um... Okay, well I didn't have a say in that.
[166:00.95]Nice blessing.
[166:01.93]What?
[166:02.79]That is a good blessing.
[166:04.83]The climb becomes unbearable as ferocious blizzard sweeps the mountain.
[166:09.02]You seek shelter in caves.
[166:11.06]and desperately fight off the onset of frostbite.
[166:13.32]Oh, fuck.
[166:18.63]It's this one.
[166:19.65]Right?
[166:20.21]It's this one.
[166:21.21]Yes.
[166:23.03]When the howling winds ease, you clear the snow from the cave entrance to discover the dark clouds have passed.
[166:30.65]Colby forages for... Colby forages for firewood, saying...
[166:39.14]God damn it.
[166:39.60]Why did I do this?
[166:41.05]Can I change this voice?
[166:41.79]Are you guys gonna let me do that?
[166:43.15]Can I change this guy's voice?
[166:44.07]I need a, like a, a pass for this one, right?
[166:55.40]No.
[166:56.54]Absolutely not.
[166:57.14]Nope.
[166:57.46]Change it.
[166:58.12]I'm seeing way, way too many no's.
[167:00.88]I'm changing it.
[167:07.44]This log is dry enough.
[167:08.16]We can set up camp here for the night.
[167:10.56]Access the campfire at any time between encounters.
[167:12.72]The campfire can be used to consume food, trade, or review your mission.
[167:17.24]Okay.
[167:20.42]Well, I guess I can camp.
[167:22.52]Let's just see what it does.
[167:23.26]Campfires will always offer warmth and heat, but they also change with each challenge.
[167:31.89]Be prepared.
[167:33.93]A figure appears from out of a swirl of frost and snow.
[167:36.63]It is a northerner.
[167:41.90]I come in peace.
[167:43.80]I make the pilgrimage to the high priestess.
[167:45.98]I mean you no harm.
[167:47.96]Without waiting for approval, he slumps down beside you and warms his hands by the fire.
[167:53.40]My clan's village is only several days' walk from here.
[167:57.91]Colby frowns at him.
[168:02.69]Change appearance.
[168:03.53]Change appearance?
[168:06.45]What?
[168:10.63]Wait, because I get to go to a campfire, I can change everything about my character?
[168:20.84]Do you unlock hairstyles?
[168:27.30]Alright, there we go.
[168:29.42]I warmed my body by the fire.
[168:31.00]I grew a mohawk.
[168:38.37]Okay.
[168:40.15]Colby looks calmer here in the bracing chill of Mount Freydis.
[168:45.19]One food restores five health.
[168:46.67]Let's just do it.
[168:49.05]I have enough health.
[168:50.41]Might as well get to full.
[168:52.35]Trade.
[168:53.83]The pilgrim offers what he can.
[168:56.79]What does he got for equipment?
[168:58.75]Ring of food.
[168:59.57]Well... What does it do?
[169:04.55]Food gain.
[169:05.05]Optionally discard any non-food gain card to receive +2 food.
[169:09.49]So that's it.
[169:10.31]So I can... It's kind of what I have already, but instead of health, it's food.
[169:16.73]Okay.
[169:19.51]Do I have anything to sell?
[169:21.35]No.
[169:23.85]Let's finish trading.
[169:26.78]You warm your frozen hands.
[169:28.14]Let's review the mission, I guess.
[169:31.46]Uh-oh.
[169:39.54]It has been many years... It has been many years since I've talked... It has been many years since I've talked... It has been many years since I've talked wisdom to the High Priestess.
[169:46.53]She will not look fondly about me.
[169:50.33]Alright, let's break camp.
[169:52.17]You sleep through the long, cold night.
[169:53.49]In the morning, you pack your things and continue your climb up the mountain.
[169:59.62]Keep going.
[170:01.84]Avalanche, oh lord.
[170:03.22]Nature, true wild nature, will not bring fury in its domain unless it is its own.
[170:14.03]High up on the mountain you see the silhouette of a man approaching through the heavy snow.
[170:18.47]He bellows through the roaring wind.
[170:24.30]Who dares trespass in the sacred grounds of our priestess?
[170:29.28]Hidden raiders spring down the mountain with dexterity of mountain goats.
[170:32.48]That's not good at all.
[170:33.20]That's terrible.
[170:33.86]These guys suck.
[170:35.34]The dexterity of a mountain goat?
[170:38.87]So these guys are gonna be easy.
[170:46.57]That's not how you describe dexterity.
[170:51.84]New shield.
[170:55.36]Bastion of Purification.
[170:57.32]Nihal was a wildly inventive craftsman and also quite, quite mad.
[171:02.74]Flavor text.
[171:03.46]You got it.
[171:05.14]Go get him.
[171:06.60]Dude, go get him!
[171:07.46]Oh my god, you're an idiot.
[171:15.21]He's also quite mad.
[171:16.21]I'm gonna do the riposte one.
[171:29.88]and the cyanide through the chest oh my god somebody just gave fifty dollars hold on I gotta see what this says 50 bucks from Duke Nukem thank you Duke Nukem for the fifty dollars five thousand bits
[171:54.21]And they say... Why are you giving me presents on your birthday?

[172:01.76]You're giving me $50 on your birthday?
[172:02.88]It's not my birthday.
[172:25.22]And no, you don't have to worry about doubling that money.
[172:29.41]But happy birthday, dude.

[172:38.77]Like I said this before, I'll say it again.
[172:40.75]I'm gonna make it very clear like I always do whenever I get amounts of money where people say I wish they could have given me more money.
[172:49.46]Don't even fucking worry about that, please.
[172:51.94]Like, you giving me 50 fucking dollars and being like, ah, shit, I wish I could give you 100.
[172:57.45]No, man, like, that... You don't have to give a damn thing.
[173:02.75]And if you do at all, any of it is appreciated.
[173:05.20]So don't worry about that at all, please.
[173:07.64]But happy birthday, Duke Nukem.
[173:08.90]Thank you for the 50 fucking dollars.

[173:32.49]You know, you had me when you first were talking about your girlfriend.
[173:35.67]Is that real?

[175:00.92]That's bad.
[175:02.40]That's like a 40%.
[175:04.71]To see me after class, I'd have to fucking get a parent's signature if I got a 40.
[175:10.43]Anyways.
[175:12.51]A B-minus streamer demands compliments.
[175:17.56]I'm kind of a try-hard.

[175:33.43]Hello, friend.
[175:36.49]Press the green... Please leave a message after the beep.
[175:43.26]I... Yeah, it's me.
[175:44.14]Who am I calling?
[175:46.04]Music fun.
[175:47.13]Picture fun.
[175:48.15]I heard you have some beautiful... Shut the fuck up.
[175:51.31]Ringtone.
[175:52.13]Use the arrow button.
[175:53.53]Number quiz.
[175:54.60]Are you ready?
[175:56.32]Which one is the number?
[175:57.82]Zero.
[175:58.42]Use the arrow buttons to pick a number and then press enter.
[176:02.72]This one.
[176:03.38]Zero.
[176:04.82]Great.
[176:05.50]I did it.
[176:07.00]Goodbye.
[176:07.70]Okay.
[176:08.48]Bye.
[176:08.81]Thanks for calling.
[176:09.39]So anyway, thank you to... Thank you, Ghoul Champ, as well as...
[176:17.16]Stix Redegade and Nick Flair for the bits.
[176:20.02]Appreciate it.
[176:22.90]Winner's Bane.
[176:24.66]Let's play the game.
[176:27.96]Knockdown Northerner requires 10 hits.
[176:30.49]Perform a powerful strike that causes knockdown to Northerners only.
[176:35.11]Enemies in knockdown can be defeated with a finisher.
[176:41.25]Riposte charge against Northerners.
[176:42.85]Riposte deals 100.
[176:43.69]That's awesome.
[176:45.85]So that's just, you want to riposte against northerners one-handed?
[176:48.34]Yeah, definitely.
[176:49.36]Please put this on.
[176:50.08]Let's go.
[176:53.00]The clash of steel rings out, echoing through the peaks.
[176:55.44]The mountains answer with a low, ominous rumble as a wall of white rushes toward the melee, sweeping away everything in its path.
[177:03.47]Shit.
[177:03.71]Wait, don't I get extra dice?
[177:06.87]Where's this guy's, um... God damn it.
[177:13.48]Come on, don't fuck me here.
[177:16.20]Oh, my God.
[177:18.11]Oh, wait a minute.
[177:20.11]He offers another die.
[177:20.99]Yes, I will accept the other die, please.
[177:23.31]Wow, what a bailout.
[177:28.43]Okay, well, thanks for the bailout, man.
[177:29.99]I appreciate it.
[177:34.17]We just cheated and won.
[177:35.47]That's good.
[177:37.27]You seek shelter against a bluff, pressing close to the rock face as the avalanche roars overhead.
[177:43.43]When the trembling stops, you are miraculously unscathed.
[177:47.67]Your assailant's weapon juts from the snow.
[177:50.05]As you near, you realize it is still clenched in his hand, his body buried to the wrist by the avalanche.
[177:57.86]Dig him out.
[177:59.61]You brave the cold and free the raider from his icy grave.
[178:02.91]He takes a moment to catch his breath and says, You saved me.
[178:08.15]Though we are enemies by blood, take my blessing and leave me to my thoughts.
[178:14.35]You gain two fame and a blessing.
[178:15.69]Allies return.
[178:17.25]That was worth doing.
[178:19.83]Revive companion.
[178:20.77]Revive your companion at the beginning of each new map.
[178:24.66]If they're dead, I guess.
[178:27.98]I need a bunch more blessings.
[178:34.02]Did I notice that the game has Twitch chat participation?
[178:36.22]Yeah, I'll touch upon it again.
[178:39.38]So, I'm gonna play this game again on Thursday.
[178:42.03]We're doing the PC build stream tomorrow.
[178:44.15]So, tomorrow we're building that fucking computer.
[178:48.09]On stream.
[178:49.67]And then Thursday, I'm going to implement the integration.
[178:54.01]We're gonna play this on Thursday.
[178:55.89]And then Friday, we're gonna start Condemned 2.
[178:59.65]So, that's the plan.
[179:04.09]Let's go.
[179:06.40]Ascension.
[179:07.86]A sudden blizzard slows your progress through Mount Freydis.
[179:12.18]The bitter winds pierce your skin like shards of glass.
[179:16.48]Well, ascend.
[179:19.61]Oh, boy.
[179:20.69]Wait, what?
[179:21.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[179:25.25]Oh, that was the keep going.
[179:26.99]Oh, well.
[179:27.55]It's okay.
[179:28.03]Shit.
[179:30.25]Shit.
[179:33.62]I can't go back, can I?
[179:34.76]I thought that was just a regular card or something.
[179:38.00]It's alright.
[179:39.50]It's okay.
[179:40.02]We just need to do every single blessing correctly.
[179:43.99]As you ascend the snowy Mount Freydis, you happen upon a cottage with pungent smoke wafting out of the chimney.
[179:49.89]A frail old lady sweeping snow off the path beckons you to come in.
[179:56.33]You better go bearing blessings if you want to get on the high priestess's good side.
[180:00.93]I'm fixing a batch right now if you like a taste.
[180:03.95]I've got it right this time.
[180:05.61]You can take to her.
[180:08.42]I'm stirring, but you can't see.
[180:10.42]Colby bows.
[180:12.52]I have a word that you are better known for your poisons.
[180:15.28]I have some of that too, but it's thanks to my blessings that I have such keen hearing.
[180:21.48]Oh.
[180:25.83]Oh my god.
[180:33.92]Every fucking time.
[180:36.08]Every fucking time.
[180:38.04]I've not won one of those.
[180:40.42]Not won this whole stream.
[180:43.30]I've been streaming for nearly three hours.
[180:47.36]And not one fucking time have I got that right with a 75% chance to win.
[180:51.19]I don't understand.
[181:05.54]You take a sip of the putrid potion and feel your stomach churn.
[181:08.04]I knew I shouldn't have substituted the cloudberries or fogberries.
[181:14.42]Don't worry.
[181:15.50]Choose the righteous path and you'll find blessings on your own way.
[181:19.05]I'm sure of it.
[181:21.89]I'm going to lose because I need four.
[181:23.85]You step outside into the blistering cold and continue up Mount Freitas.
[181:26.87]That was a free blessing.
[181:28.61]I didn't even get the free blessing, guys.
[181:34.27]Why is my facecam on?
[181:35.27]What are you talking about?
[181:35.91]Why is my facecam on?
[181:37.55]I don't have a facecam on.
[181:41.03]Why is my facecam on?
[181:43.19]It's not.
[181:47.03]I'm not turning my facecam on.
[181:48.64]Because I don't want you to see.
[181:49.62]I don't want you to see the setup that's behind me.
[181:54.34]It's pretty elaborate.
[181:56.76]Do I have pimples?
[181:58.50]Why?
[182:02.64]Facecam's not on.
[182:04.77]I made sure of that.
[182:05.63]Alright, let's go.
[182:09.03]Hopefully I can get four more.
[182:09.97]Blizzard.
[182:10.21]Oh, he's making a joke about the guy.
[182:11.01]Oh.
[182:11.07]Well, you got me, I guess.
[182:11.75]We've already done this one.
[182:12.45]You need to find shelter.
[182:33.69]Right here.
[182:34.91]Oh.
[182:37.25]I'm so over it.
[182:42.31]I think this might be a reset, guys.
[182:45.90]I'm not muted either!
[182:49.12]Stop this nonsense!
[182:50.26]I'm not fucking muted!
[182:52.08]What is this?
[182:53.74]Why are you guys doing like Twitch chat jokes from like 2014?
[182:59.13]The wretched smell of fish meat and stale sweat alerts you to the presence of a bear rousing from hibernation.
[183:05.15]The ferocious beast bares its teeth and swipes at you with giant paws.
[183:08.71]And I got hurt badly.
[183:10.94]You flee the cave, having barely survived the savage attack.
[183:13.68]Luckily, the blizzard has passed.
[183:16.52]Colby forges for firewood, saying, This is a log.
[183:19.34]Is it dry enough?
[183:20.26]And we can camp if you fucking want to.
[183:22.38]Sure thing.
[183:26.95]Uh...
[183:28.48]As though you are being stalked, the gentle northerner pilgrim emerges from the darkness slumping down beside you.
[183:34.62]What was this guy's voice?
[183:37.60]Was this guy Irish?
[183:39.27]No, he was like French.
[183:41.57]I think, right?
[183:42.89]Whatever.
[183:45.03]Mount Freitas does never bite, does it, no?
[183:47.87]I love her hushkies and bitter golden braids.
[183:50.51]Another day's good climb.
[183:54.38]My clan's village is only several days walk from here.
[183:57.68]That's the wrong actor.
[184:00.71]Cook food.
[184:02.69]Yum.
[184:03.67]Yum.
[184:04.65]Yeah.
[184:05.77]Yes.
[184:07.05]Yes.
[184:07.77]Trade.
[184:08.03]What do you got for equipment?
[184:10.43]I can't even afford it.
[184:12.07]What can I do?
[184:13.63]I can sell US.
[184:14.93]No, I'm not.
[184:16.91]Finish trading.
[184:18.67]Goodbye.
[184:21.61]Comcast strikes again.
[184:22.50]What happened?
[184:25.94]I'm good.
[184:26.26]We've got no frames dropped.
[184:29.41]Another fucking Blizzard.
[184:30.57]What the hell?
[184:31.23]Is this all you have?
[184:32.51]Is Blizzard cards?
[184:34.85]Are Blizzard cards?
[184:39.15]Yeah, the stream's still going.
[184:42.57]The climb becomes unbearable.
[184:43.89]Here comes another Blizzard.
[184:45.09]Oh my god!
[184:58.76]I was so sure of that.
[185:04.90]You guys in the... everybody in the chat can agree with me here.
[185:08.49]Two... it was two.
[185:10.41]Everybody would have said two.
[185:11.33]I gotta stop picking immediately, because I want a bunch of other people to be wrong with me.
[185:16.63]So then I can't get made fun of.
[185:20.63]You are alerted to the sound of shuffling footsteps.
[185:22.45]You can barely make out the silhouettes of the menacing figures who have invaded your shelter.
[185:27.70]Oh god.
[185:28.20]They're not the sort you'd want to be in such close quarters with.
[185:30.80]Now we have to fight.
[185:41.58]That's why there's Twitch chat integration.
[185:48.59]Now we have Berserkers.
[185:51.55]They're imbued with ice that slow their enemies' attacks.
[185:53.25]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[185:53.99]Slow.
[185:55.07]Don't have to worry about that, though.
[186:01.40]I got to riposte.
[186:02.42]Yeah.
[186:08.07]And there's that.
[186:09.63]Execute.
[186:10.49]Watch it.
[186:19.48]One more over here.
[186:20.80]Oh, two guys.
[186:21.16]That's right.
[186:21.84]Yeah.
[186:28.58]Through the gullet.
[186:31.69]You get him.
[186:34.89]Nice job.
[186:37.20]Nice work, dude.
[186:38.18]You did a wonderful work job.
[186:44.72]Why does my hair look like shit?
[186:46.40]There's no facecam on.
[186:49.68]Stop this nonsense.
[186:54.06]I got food at least.
[186:55.62]Discard from Ag- No, I'm gonna keep the- No.
[186:58.66]Keep the food.
[187:00.11]Probably gonna need it.
[187:03.02]As the blizzard eases, the intruders make their escape.
[187:05.80]I can campfire.
[187:06.68]I don't need to do a campfire right now.
[187:10.98]No.
[187:11.40]I'm not.
[187:12.02]Do not.
[187:12.68]Turn back.
[187:13.14]Turn back.
[187:13.71]Turn back.
[187:14.61]We need to get blessings.
[187:16.73]Fame and shame.
[187:17.41]Here we go.
[187:18.05]I knew you were approaching and tailored things around your lust for fame.
[187:30.61]You follow the sound of hammering into the town hall.
[187:33.33]Inside, a tiny man stands atop a stool, clipping away at a row of marble sculptures.
[187:39.47]Impressive, is it not?
[187:41.09]Sir Malifowl of Cadare is a great patron of the arts.
[187:44.97]You could be too.
[187:47.83]Commission a ceramic sculpture.
[187:51.78]Fucking hell.
[187:55.08]Alright, so, I'll get you out.
[187:57.32]Which one was that?
[187:59.72]Which one?
[188:01.98]Hmm?
[188:05.20]Which one?
[188:09.61]I think it was a huge failure.
[188:14.69]I- I was gonna say three.
[188:21.92]Okay.
[188:23.98]All you guys writing one, or two,
[188:30.23]Sometime later, you return to see the finished product.
[188:32.39]An exact replica of you stands in the town hall among sculptures of nobles.
[188:37.13]I guarantee such a status symbol will earn you great admiration from the people of the Empire.
[188:43.34]Thanks.
[188:46.04]That's not a blessing, though.
[188:49.68]Here we go.
[188:51.66]The Temple of Divine Providence's make a donation, get a blessing.
[188:55.93]What is Longshot?
[188:58.15]Score the exact target value in a dice gambit to draw five equipment cards.
[189:04.55]Holy shit.
[189:06.28]That's kind of insane.
[189:12.20]I mean, this is good, but... I mean... I kind of want this.
[189:19.85]Either that or this.
[189:20.45]Yeah, we're going to go with this one.
[189:29.51]Gain up to 20 gold at the beginning of a new map if you have less than 20 gold.
[189:34.17]I have three of six blessings.
[189:35.95]Hopefully I can... Hopefully I can actually... Is another quest.
[189:40.73]Nope.
[189:54.36]Westwind's only tavern, the Rusty Razor, is a safe harbor among the many dangers of the outer reaches of the Empire.
[190:01.61]Its barkeep sits outside his establishment with a look of resigned defeat.
[190:07.32]Upon your arrival, he jokes straight up and a smile almost breaks out across his face.
[190:11.20]At last, someone from the guild is here.
[190:13.64]These Empire soldiers have almost ruined me.
[190:16.49]Before you can disagree, the owner swings open the saloon doors and pushes you inside.
[190:20.47]Come in, please get in here, please come in.
[190:22.95]Inside, you discover a handful of Empire soldiers enjoying ale rather than doing their duty.
[190:28.23]The freshly invigorated barkeep hops onto a table and shouts above the noise...
[190:33.21]You lazy drunken deserters are done!
[190:35.95]The Steward's Guild has sent an enforcer here, and now all of you are going to have to get back to your posts!
[190:42.43]This town needs defending!
[190:45.89]One of the soldiers rises with a slight sway.
[190:48.75]Aye, we got three days until our shift ends and we return to civilization.
[190:53.00]So we're not doing any fighting unless they threaten to supply a veil.
[190:57.14]Right, lads?
[190:58.65]A raucous cheer erupts and beer tankards smash together all around.
[191:01.59]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[191:04.15]So why don't you take your shiny little badge and shove off?
[191:08.69]The barkeep turns to you.
[191:10.43]What are you gonna do, man?
[191:15.33]Threaten.
[191:17.33]You suggest with menace that the soldiers should report to duty or they'll report to the healer.
[191:23.65]God damn it.
[191:27.53]It's one.
[191:29.42]It's one, right?
[191:33.50]I would say one.
[191:35.65]If I was hopefully correct about it.
[191:43.18]It's one.
[191:43.88]It has to be one.
[191:45.68]It was definitely one.
[191:48.66]Oh my god.
[191:54.61]Well, a huge amount of you guys got it wrong too.
[191:59.62]Because it was four.
[192:02.06]I won't be threatened by the likes of you, the soldier grumbles as he rises, followed by his friends.
[192:15.54]We can pretend we are lying.
[192:21.04]Yeah, but only you get hurt.
[192:23.11]That's not... I guess.
[192:26.57]Winter's Bane.
[192:27.21]Used to defend those in need.
[192:28.55]I think these guys are easy.
[192:33.75]Oh, I can block ranged?
[192:35.00]Shit.
[192:38.58]I could have blocked that.
[192:50.06]I'm waiting to see the thing over there in the corner.
[192:54.68]What does this dude have?
[192:56.72]51 damage.
[192:56.98]Holy shit.
[192:57.49]That's a lot.
[193:03.01]You came out of nowhere.
[193:03.97]Well, I completely missed him, but they got the job done.
[193:17.66]Shit.
[193:17.98]Could have executed him.
[193:29.15]Alright, that was just a pitcher pitching a pitch.
[193:34.36]You know what I'm saying.
[193:35.06]That was just a pitcher throwing a fastball, and I was the batter waiting for it.
[193:38.76]I was sitting on that.
[193:39.54]That was a home run.
[193:47.76]There you go.
[193:49.61]Game five, max health.
[193:52.41]Five food.
[193:53.41]Yeah, I'm going to take it.
[193:58.62]As soldiers fall under yet another blow from your weapon, the leader shouts out, Stop!
[194:02.46]Alright, we'll do our part.
[194:03.77]Just stop cracking our skulls!
[194:07.13]I got it.
[194:07.43]Alright, that's it, right?
[194:11.77]Gotta go.
[194:12.51]Gotta ascend.
[194:13.69]I don't think there's gonna be enough.
[194:15.13]I don't know if I have enough.
[194:16.19]Well, I got 12 gold.
[194:17.56]That's pretty huge.
[194:24.09]Blessed Brew.
[194:24.83]Oh, come on.
[194:26.72]I have to get this.
[194:27.76]Otherwise, it's a reset.
[194:34.62]Further up the mountain, the blizzard becomes so intense you barely see the tiny college engulfed in snow.
[194:39.50]An old lady beckons you in.
[194:41.91]I've received word from my sister's hawk, and I've been expecting you.
[194:46.39]I may not be as skilled as her, but this blessing potion I've whipped up is my best yet.
[194:51.89]Do you think it's good enough to take to the high priestess?
[194:55.59]She says, blowing up the steam from a simmering liquid in...
[195:07.94]Okay, sacrifice.
[195:10.58]Prior to combat with two or more monster card, optionally discard a basic monster card but lose your companion for three turns.
[195:17.12]So I guess I can drop the companion and make it easier, I guess.
[195:26.59]Okay, I need two more blessings.
[195:31.05]You take a sip from the aromatic potion and feel a warm fuzzy feeling flowing through your body.
[195:36.07]Looks like my recipe is a success.
[195:39.02]I'm sure the high priestess will appreciate this one.
[195:41.32]Forgot I had an Irish accent.
[195:43.08]Well, at least my sister did.
[195:44.74]Suddenly means I need a slight one at the end here.
[195:48.42]You thank the old lady for continuing up the mist.
[195:50.80]No quotes here.
[195:52.29]Don't pay attention to me.
[195:54.57]You pay no heed to my brewing.
[195:56.39]Goodbye.
[196:00.76]Shit, I'm sorry.
[196:05.89]Man-eating tree.
[196:10.11]High on a misty mountaintop, you discover a vicious-looking plant.
[196:15.27]Its gaping mouth looks more than capable of shredding you to pieces, but at its base you notice some unusual fruit.
[196:22.97]If you throw something, you may be able to distract the savage mouth, thus allowing you to steal some fruit.
[196:28.76]Throw a piece of equipment to distract the mouth.
[196:32.83]Inspect your supplies for something suitable.
[196:36.73]Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
[196:39.03]I didn't... I can't go back.
[196:49.28]Take the shield.
[196:50.74]Whatever.
[196:53.86]No, I don't throw my equipment.
[196:55.34]There we go.
[196:56.22]Keep my equipment.
[196:57.90]You look for something suitable on the ground to throw, but quickly lose your way in the mist.
[197:02.72]Duh, I ain't losing that shit.
[197:05.33]For what?
[197:05.69]Walking through a shady forest, you encounter a frail old maiden.
[197:08.77]She stops to greet you.
[197:17.73]For centuries, I have helped the mortals who find themselves lost in my forest.
[197:23.39]Is there anything that I'm able to help with you on your journey?
[197:30.26]Give me some money.
[197:32.74]No amount of gold will satisfy a mortal, but if that is what you wish, your voice is ancient and falters and it's all fucked up.
[197:39.05]And you got ten gold.
[197:42.53]Look, we got three old ladies in a row, okay?
[197:47.58]What am I supposed to do?
[197:49.61]I gotta differentiate them somehow.
[197:54.27]Avalanche again.
[198:00.43]Is this Broadway?
[198:01.87]Yeah.
[198:05.21]High up on the mountain, you see the silhouette of a man approaching through the heavy snow.
[198:08.57]He bellows through the roaring wind.
[198:15.51]Hey!
[198:18.36]Hidden raiders spring down the mountain with the dexterity of mountain goats.
[198:21.42]We've done this before.
[198:22.18]We just have to beat them.
[198:24.00]Sacrifice your companion to discard a monster card.
[198:26.70]No.
[198:27.68]These guys are easy.
[198:36.97]Hey, Arnold.
[198:40.57]I got all my equipment still.
[198:43.89]Let's head back out there.
[198:51.74]Riposte!
[198:54.14]Riposte!
[199:00.04]That's how you take out two birds with one stone.
[199:02.77]Yep.
[199:08.91]See you later.
[199:15.29]I don't really like the ability power this thing has.
[199:17.85]Who's the last guy?
[199:22.09]Oh.
[199:26.79]You get it.
[199:27.63]Get it.
[199:27.85]Nice job.
[199:33.23]What's Colby swinging at?
[199:34.39]I have no idea.
[199:36.15]This guy's kind of useless.
[199:37.21]I don't like this guy.
[199:37.89]But I'm going to keep him around for the dice.
[199:40.35]That is a huge reason to keep him around.
[199:44.02]Gain one equipment from two.
[199:48.64]No, I want to... Let's do it.
[199:52.62]Ring of food or armor of gluttony.
[199:54.12]Let's see what this one is.
[199:56.00]Food defense.
[199:57.72]Gain plus three defense if you have 20 plus food.
[200:00.90]Gain an extra three defense for each additional five food.
[200:04.38]Receive plus one food for every gain food or gain gold you receive.
[200:09.85]Yes, I will definitely take that.
[200:12.07]I got a lot of food.
[200:15.67]How to handle hunger and resources during battles.
[200:20.85]Alright, well, now I got... There we go.
[200:22.33]Now I got the 20 food.
[200:24.69]Fat armor.
[200:26.46]The clash of steel rings out, echoing through the peaks.
[200:28.46]The mountains answer with a low, ominous rumble as a wall of white rushes towards the melee, sweeping away everything in its path.
[200:36.60]Don't worry, I got my buddy here, so if I don't roll well, then, um... Let's just... This one, come on.
[200:44.33]There we go.
[200:48.81]And I win.
[200:50.95]You seek shelter against a bluff, pressing close to the rock face.
[200:53.69]You are fine.
[200:55.77]Your assailant's weapon juts from the snow.
[200:58.07]As you near, you realize it's still clenched.
[200:59.77]Um, dig him out again.
[201:02.77]You save me, though we are enemies by blood.
[201:04.95]Take my blessing and lead me to my thoughts.
[201:07.33]They divide Providence.
[201:09.65]Adds +2 to each of your dice during a dice game, but that's insane.
[201:14.08]I need one more blessing.
[201:15.90]Please.
[201:22.50]The climb becomes unbearable.
[201:23.68]Here comes the blizzard.
[201:25.65]Don't fail.
[201:31.75]Got it that time.
[201:33.81]When the hotling winds ease, you clear the snow from the cave entrance.
[201:37.21]The clouds have passed.
[201:38.95]You can set up camp if you'd like.
[201:40.35]I don't need to.
[201:41.53]Clan Eyebright.
[201:44.30]And his reasons for leaving.
[201:49.74]Okay, so Colby returns to his home village to partake and toil the ritual cleaning of his people's ancestral grave mounds.
[201:57.09]He invites you to accompany him.
[202:00.79]Do I have to give up a blessing to do this?
[202:03.70]I'm kind of scared to hit this button.
[202:06.86]Because it requires one blessing.
[202:09.10]Does that mean I have to give one?
[202:14.63]I don't know if I want to do this right now.
[202:23.60]You keep it.
[202:24.89]Okay, so you do it.
[202:25.89]It's fine.
[202:26.65]Okay.
[202:29.19]Clan Ibright's village, hidden in the forests of Mount Freydis, is a burned-out husk.
[202:33.85]You see no inhabitants within the collapsed walls and fallen roofs.
[202:38.03]Colby leads you through the trees to the grave mounds, a flat, snowy field dotted with bloody, bawdy-sized hillocks.
[202:45.80]A few villagers are here, kneeling by the certain... Learn how to read.
[202:50.60]A few villagers are here, kneeling by the cairns in prayer.
[202:55.78]You realize they are all either old or enfeebled.
[202:59.15]Your stout companion kneels before three graves.
[203:01.85]They look fresh, the grasses yet to grow over them.
[203:06.23]He empties a flask of amoror spirits over the mounds and lets a blessing fall into the cold Earth by them.
[203:14.66]Oh, you fucking assholes.
[203:21.21]god damn it I can't believe I listened to you guys unbelievable why would I ever I'm never listening to chat ever again unbelievable god damn it I lost
[203:45.82]You kneel on the cold, hard ground besides him as he bends his head in prayer.
[203:49.44]The tranquility is shattered by a jagged rock bouncing off your companion's back.
[203:55.79]You draw your weapon and turn to see an old northerner woman bent over with rage.
[204:01.05]And she's aged, clutching a basket of rocks.
[204:03.69]Fierce hatred burns behind her eyes.
[204:06.30]Get out!
[204:06.96]Get out of here!
[204:07.60]Betrayer!
[204:08.14]Life-burner!
[204:09.18]Let's see what happens.
[204:09.86]What happened?
[204:11.04]What?
[204:33.94]An elder, his head wreathed in bone and blossom, steps forward, his wrinkled fists clenched with anger.
[204:40.28]Why have you returned?
[204:43.19]Colby waves a massive hand at the three grave mounds.
[204:48.37]Your duty was to die for this clan or your hearth, but you were too cowardly to do either.
[204:54.74]Why couldn't you do it?
[204:56.96]I had a daughter.
[204:58.53]Your sons.
[204:59.77]They burnt everything.
[205:01.39]All because you could not die for us.
[205:04.55]Colby merely stares blankly into the distance.
[205:08.50]Pay the villagers 30 gold to see reason.
[205:12.12]Oh my fucking lord, that's too much money.
[205:24.90]A win here sets the tone for your challenge.
[205:36.15]The Elder looks hungrily at the gold.
[205:39.33]Coint will buy us food and warmth.
[205:41.57]Perhaps it will ward off the other clans from coming to pick at our remains.
[205:45.71]He accepts the goal.
[205:46.49]The villagers seem less angry now, though their sadness remains.
[205:50.40]The elder sighs.
[205:52.36]We have nothing.
[205:53.54]Only anger drives me now.
[205:56.14]Betrayer Colby, prove yourself in the Hoarfrost trial.
[206:00.34]Prove you are worthy of dying for Clan Eibright again.
[206:03.28]We all must seek redemption along this road, for all have made errors.
[206:09.03]So, I think this is a failure, because I don't think it's possible for me to win.
[206:14.30]It's not.
[206:15.22]No.
[206:17.78]So, I lose.
[206:20.52]The winds clear, the dark clouds reveal the spire of a ritual house.
[206:25.56]You press on through thick snow to find the wooden structure, but I couldn't do it anyways.
[206:29.57]So, I lost anyways.
[206:32.53]What happens if I go in?
[206:34.47]Just go in.
[206:35.83]I don't have six blessings.
[206:36.79]Who gives a shit?
[206:37.49]Fuck this lady.
[206:39.36]As you enter the Great Hall, the towering arch doors swing open with a heavy creak.
[206:43.80]A giantess in a velvet robe enters, accompanied by raiders.
[206:48.22]Colby throws himself down to the floor in reverence.
[206:51.46]The giantess glances at him lazily.
[206:54.97]What have we here?
[206:55.89]A northerner in one of the Empire?
[206:59.65]What did you bring to appease my wrath?
[207:03.65]Only four blessings?
[207:05.23]What a pitiful effort!
[207:06.77]With the flick of her wrist, bolts of lightning strike you.
[207:09.18]Ooh!
[207:09.82]For not bringing enough blessings, you have failed to win the gold token.
[207:12.90]Oh!
[207:17.72]Only four blessings?
[207:20.61]What are you thinking, mate?
[207:23.13]The giant just claps, the sound ringing in the silent, cold hall.
[207:28.43]This small thing survived it.
[207:30.21]Impressive.
[207:31.49]But if you wish to speak to me of a treaty, you must prove yourself against my champion.
[207:36.56]A raider's charge toward you.
[207:48.90]So I can't get her token.
[207:49.92]So I'm going to have to come back here another time.
[207:54.79]There he is.
[207:55.21]Oh my god.
[207:57.41]It's the...
[207:58.71]It's the father from Undertale!
[208:01.23]Dad!
[208:01.87]What's his name?
[208:02.63]Argus!
[208:04.95]Fierce, loyal, and relentless.
[208:06.63]Champion of the High Priestess.
[208:07.79]Berserker weapons are imbued with ice that slows their enemies.
[208:14.20]Let's just make it happen.
[208:17.70]Fuck.
[208:26.03]Whoa!
[208:27.88]Whoa, somebody's killing somebody.
[208:34.73]One at a time.
[208:35.25]Good thing I'm so glad that I can block that.
[208:39.95]And... LT!
[208:59.64]Steven Universe.
[209:02.02]What is that from?
[209:03.63]What is Steven Universe from?
[209:06.57]I know it's a show on Cartoon Network.
[209:09.67]Everybody calm down.
[209:11.75]I need to beat this guy.
[209:12.57]Alright, here we go.
[209:25.54]Left bumper.
[209:27.22]And let's end it.
[209:33.22]Cuphead.
[209:33.78]Oh, right, right, right.
[209:34.42]Okay, I remember.
[209:36.99]Now I remember.
[209:39.35]Well, we beat the mission, but we didn't actually beat the mission.
[209:44.59]Even though you failed to bring me your offering, I'm impressed with how you wield your sword.
[209:49.10]Now hear my terms.
[209:51.52]The High Priestess draws herself up, a towering figure, draped in fur and wrath.
[209:56.78]The North will never bend to the Empire.
[209:59.80]Blood for blood for blood.
[210:02.18]Those are my terms.
[210:03.58]Shall you listen, small one?
[210:05.80]Let your leaders hear it and quake.
[210:08.60]With that, you make a quick descent to relay the message back to General.
[210:11.77]Run!
[210:16.79]We still got this.
[210:20.53]Humble Hammer, Berserker's Creed, and an Extinguisher.
[210:25.96]Winter Solstice, Burning Building, Temple Prayers, and Cartographer.
[210:32.11]For ascending Mount Freitas, your supplies have been added to Viput, Warrior's Axe, Soldier's Sword.
[210:41.54]And this is for clearing out the Rusty Razor.
[210:46.16]Friendly Innkeeper.
[210:51.54]For convincing Clan Eyebright to give Kolbjorn another chance.
[210:54.46]Ooh.
[210:56.45]Hoarfrost Trial.
[210:57.49]Why is this?
[210:58.07]Is it legendary?
[210:59.97]Why is it on fire?
[211:03.93]Interesting.
[211:04.39]Cool.
[211:07.31]Alright.
[211:08.01]Well, I didn't get the gold medal.
[211:11.11]You understand the basic rules of the game now.
[211:14.33]Beat the tutorial, guys.
[211:15.39]Congratulations.
[211:17.03]They will change.
[211:19.31]What?
[211:20.67]Hey, let me spend a long time explaining you the rules of the game.
[211:25.02]It's been about four hours.
[211:27.08]By the way, now that you know the rules, they all change now.
[211:32.10]What's with the four-hour tutorial for another four-hour tutorial?
[211:34.48]I'm just kidding.
[211:36.69]The Hierophant, the Lovers, the Chariot...
[211:41.10]Um, let me pee.
[211:43.96]Let me just go to the bathroom.
[211:44.70]I'll be right back.
[211:46.63]Take this opportunity to BRB yourself.
[211:49.07]See you guys in a moment.
[211:50.53]And we're going to do, what's going to do one?
[211:52.11]We'll do the Keyblades.
[211:53.77]We'll do the Keyblades.
[211:55.95]Be right back.
[214:11.31]Thank you.
[214:48.19]Alright, I am back.
[214:50.51]How's everybody doing?
[214:51.13]Good?
[214:53.01]Remember, we heard a window open.
[214:55.53]That's interesting.
[214:56.23]I wonder who it could be.
[214:58.21]I don't know.
[215:01.33]I don't care.
[215:02.25]I'm not gonna turn around.
[215:03.03]You know what I mean?
[215:05.63]Like, yeah, you guys heard a window open behind me?
[215:07.99]I'm not turning around.
[215:11.45]So, whatever.
[215:12.09]And that.
[215:16.77]Bring this back up.
[215:17.63]Okay.

[215:30.33]Well, I've read it.
[215:30.95]I'm sorry.
[215:31.83]Thank you, Max.
[215:33.85]Welcome to the stream.
[215:35.23]Welcome to the non-lurk.
[215:37.71]Because now you are no longer a lurker.
[215:39.14]Because now I've said your name.
[215:41.36]And now I've said you out loud.
[215:44.40]Hey guys, wait, wait, wait.
[215:44.92]What am I drinking?
[215:45.38]What am I drinking?

[216:28.12]Probably not.
[216:29.50]Unless I got really, you know, over the course of the next three or four months.
[216:34.70]I'll want to tap back into some older games.
[216:37.21]Because I do still have a backlog of stuff to play that's more than five or ten years old.
[216:43.15]We still have to do Condemned 2, which Condemned 1 was a fucking absolute joy.
[216:48.64]So I'm obviously going to play through all of Condemned 2.
[216:51.95]We have this to play.
[216:54.57]We'll see where we're at in a few weeks.
[216:56.97]And we'll go from there.
[216:58.19]We'll see.

[217:20.31]Appreciate it.
[217:21.91]With that, let's keep going.
[217:24.52]What did I say?
[217:24.88]We're going to do the Keyblades, right?
[217:26.08]The Hierophant.
[217:29.62]Discover which assassin seeks to kill Father Godfrey.
[217:32.68]Here comes a sneeze.
[217:33.78]And it's not going to be good, and I can't mute.
[217:35.62]I'm sorry.
[217:36.46]I'm so sorry.
[217:38.14]Okay, let's take... The bonus dice or so.
[217:46.40]I can't.
[217:47.10]I have to take them.
[217:48.71]Alright.
[217:51.33]Let's add this.
[217:52.33]Max Brimstone cards?
[217:54.98]Platinum cards?
[217:57.76]Okay, I'm sorry.
[217:58.30]I gotta... This is kind of freaking me out a little bit here.
[218:00.58]Inspect.
[218:01.96]Draw this encounter card during a challenge to discover its traits.
[218:04.54]Maybe a... I'll just take it.
[218:05.58]Let's see what it fucking does.
[218:09.68]Friendly Innkeeper.
[218:10.52]I can do eight.
[218:12.06]Gnomish Exchange.
[218:14.40]Winter Solstice.
[218:15.22]This looks interesting.
[218:17.87]I still have to get Market Thief.
[218:19.71]I still need Market Thief.
[218:20.99]I have to do that.
[218:23.97]I can't do this without Meloclips.
[218:27.09]Cartographer and Burning Building.
[218:30.47]Go with those.
[218:34.92]Let's see here.
[218:35.60]I have a lot of options.
[218:39.52]Berserker's Creed.
[218:42.82]Helmet.
[218:43.88]Extinguisher.
[218:45.96]Ruby Ring.
[218:46.54]I should probably add some weapons.
[218:49.98]Humble Hammer.
[218:52.56]And... Cartoblade and Valiant Aegis.
[219:02.91]Okay, let's take two supply cards.
[219:06.23]Why do these have... That's weird.
[219:09.50]I don't understand.
[219:10.82]These guys have a card pack on them?
[219:13.46]I guess we're going to try them.
[219:16.19]Let's go.
[219:16.43]We need to find out who's going to kill the king.
[219:27.31]It's just like fucking Malfurion.
[219:37.16]With Malacalypse's encouragement, well it's a few murders in the grand scheme of things, you find yourself sat opposite the opulently dressed leader of the Thieves Guild.
[219:45.83]or one of the leaders.
[219:47.07]It's a shadowy organization.
[219:49.53]He takes a sip of wine and leans back to savor the taste.
[220:01.30]I am scheduled to be assassinated.
[220:06.08]The new assassin has been determined, and so the tale begins.
[220:10.04]I believe the suspect is one of my own.
[220:13.87]With subtle nods, he indicates a bearded man, a woman with red hair, and a man with gray eyes.
[220:20.61]Borden, Rowena, and Gwyndon, my three personal silencers.
[220:28.73]One of them left me this note, I am sure.
[220:32.05]When the red candle's flame burns out, on his last evening at the Milbury Inn, the false priest will have his sins appeased.
[220:40.13]He points out the red candle upon the fireplace.
[220:43.75]The assassin favors theatrics over secrecy, it seems.
[220:48.51]He's apparently fucking Ichabod Crane.
[220:52.33]What's the Johnny Depp?
[220:54.05]What's his name?
[220:55.38]What's the guy's name?
[220:56.04]The fucking pirate.
[220:58.90]Johnny Depp.
[220:59.52]No, what's the pirate's name?
[221:01.06]Captain Jack Sparrow.
[221:02.76]There it is.
[221:05.68]Find the assassin for me to do that.
[221:08.37]You will likely need gold.
[221:09.67]Thieves will tell you anything for gold.
[221:14.57]Gary Busey.
[221:18.73]Ask for more information about the assassin.
[221:21.31]A note was left to me.
[221:22.04]Without being a fucking dickhead, let me read this.
[221:25.44]When the red candle's flame burns out, on his last evening at the Mulberry Inn, the false priest will have his sins appeased.
[221:32.62]Okay.
[221:35.89]What about Borden?
[221:38.87]Borden is the eldest of my employ, a simple, nervous kid.
[221:43.30]I highly doubt that he would have the heart nor the finesse to assassinate me, unless he has hidden his true nature all this time.
[221:51.34]Galfrey said that Borden has worked for him a long time.
[221:55.16]I'd say you'd have to pour a few meads into him if you want him to talk.
[221:59.75]Okay, so get him drunk.
[222:03.93]Find the assassin for me.
[222:05.19]To do that, you need gold.
[222:06.73]Okay, what about Rowena?
[222:10.96]Rowena has been one of my silences for as long as I've been in this position.
[222:14.98]And that is a very long time indeed.
[222:17.54]Rowena has worked for him for a long time.
[222:19.97]I ask that she infiltrate the Third Legion of the Imperial Army and eliminate their captain.
[222:24.75]She did so, of course, as efficient as anything.
[222:28.09]So she was in the Third Legion of the Empire Army.
[222:32.19]I suspect that she is only a Jupiter.
[222:34.71]What is going on in the chat here?
[222:36.63]What is going on?
[222:37.09]Jupiter?
[222:37.25]Why?
[222:37.41]Why so many?
[222:42.32]That emote is now banned for life.
[222:45.56]I suspect that she is only truly loyal to gold, but she is quite a valuable asset to the guild.
[222:51.18]So I would be ashamed if she intends to assassinate me.
[222:56.97]Romana will always tell the truth for money.
[222:58.95]Okay.
[223:01.61]What about the last guy?
[223:04.75]Everyone's worked for this guy for a long time.
[223:07.71]Gaffrey said that Grindon makes wild accusations when drunk.
[223:10.47]He's prone to making the most preposterous claims, many of which are untrue.
[223:13.47]I'd be wary of his exaggerations, even if he isn't the assassin, and especially when he's had too much to drink.
[223:20.85]Okay.
[223:22.06]Who are you?
[223:22.48]I am known as Father Galfrey, though it is not my true name.
[223:28.12]Of course, I keep track of accounts in this region.
[223:31.70]Bye.
[223:32.74]Good night.
[223:36.77]Alright, we got clues.
[223:39.33]And here's... Here we go.
[223:45.74]Colby the Betrayer, you are to survive in the forest with neither sustenance or warmth.
[223:50.80]The elder of Clan Eibright awaits you both at the edge of the Grim Wilds, a glacial forest of blizzards, beasts, and treachery.
[223:59.05]If the ancestors see you through this night, you are forgiven.
[224:03.01]You place your foodstuffs into a basket.
[224:05.11]You lose four food.
[224:08.58]The elder can't help but look longingly at the charming miniature pies you've recently bought.
[224:14.67]I don't want to beg, but many in the clan go hungry each night.
[224:17.79]I don't have any more food.
[224:22.15]No, I'm keeping my fucking food.
[224:25.79]Each crumb will be returned to you should you return tomorrow, yeah.
[224:28.57]With little ceremony, Colby descends into the Grim Wilds.
[224:31.86]He gives you a word of warning.
[224:40.75]The Grim Wilds will offer us no refuge from the cold.
[224:44.11]We must keep moving if we want to survive.
[224:47.92]Now he's just the other guy.
[224:49.66]It is still bright out as you delve further in.
[224:51.54]The metal handle of your weapon chills your side.
[224:53.68]It is early afternoon.
[224:54.50]Keep moving.
[224:56.80]The intense cold makes it hard to think.
[224:58.90]It is difficult to remember whether a path or tree is familiar or new.
[225:07.64]What happened to my chat room?
[225:11.88]What happened to the chat?
[225:12.75]The chat is going fucking crazy.
[225:15.85]The forest leads you to a large frozen pond cut into the mountain.
[225:21.03]Drink from the pond.
[225:26.81]It takes some strength, but you manage to crack open the ice and scoop a handful of water into your mouth.
[225:32.05]The chill numbs your wounds.
[225:35.60]Well...
[225:37.48]Uh, explore someplace else.
[225:41.32]It is still bright out as you delve further in.
[225:43.36]The metal handle of your weapon chills.
[225:44.92]Keep moving.
[225:45.42]Uh, keep moving.
[225:47.90]The intense cold makes it hard to think.
[225:50.35]Oh, God.
[225:51.83]I have to wander around in a circle until I find the right place.
[225:54.23]Oh, great.
[225:55.53]There we go.
[226:02.51]Too many Jupiters.
[226:04.15]Too many Jupes.
[226:04.91]Chat ruined.
[226:07.85]You stumble across a small stone shrine, a roughly chiseled figurine of a vulture, or is it a human, sits within.
[226:14.52]Colby drops a few coins into the shrine and prays.
[226:18.02]Let's do the same.
[226:19.62]You drop a few coins into the frozen offering bowl and bend your head in prayer.
[226:24.89]I'm just gaining life.
[226:25.89]This is not doing anything.
[226:28.87]I only have three nights until this guy gets assassinated.
[226:34.95]Okay, let's keep going.
[226:36.69]We're like walking around having a... Like past the peace pipe, you know what I mean?
[226:42.73]What are we doing?
[226:43.09]We're having like a voyage out in the forest?
[226:46.12]We're gonna find ourselves?
[226:49.14]The sun is setting, bathing the grim wilds in warm orange.
[226:52.50]If you were not knee-deep in icy snow, you could perhaps enjoy the beauty of it.
[226:57.02]Colby stands like a morse code, a morose statue, ignoring the sunset.
[227:03.67]Keep going.
[227:04.97]The intense cold makes it hard to think.
[227:06.83]You don't know where you're going.
[227:09.46]Neither do I. Eleven.
[227:11.82]Well, we're obviously re-rolling this one.
[227:16.12]Just barely.
[227:19.40]Is there a mod-only mode?
[227:22.56]What is fucking happening?
[227:25.33]Stop it.
[227:26.39]Stop it.
[227:26.93]I demand you stop it.
[227:28.57]Cease it once.
[227:30.38]See, ban emotes.
[227:32.56]Emote, how do you do reverse emote only mode?
[227:35.33]Can you do no emote only mode?
[227:37.71]Only text mode.
[227:46.15]There's a mod only mode.
[227:47.61]No.
[227:47.85]What are you doing to the owl?
[227:51.03]What's with the bulge, the penis bulge owl face now?
[227:58.02]Crow cocks its head at you and speaks in the common tongue.
[228:02.80]How now, wanderers in the grim?
[228:04.92]Are the wanderers lost?
[228:06.24]Do they require resistance?
[228:11.06]Give him the axe.
[228:15.85]You place the weapon at the crow's feet.
[228:17.91]Fuck.
[228:22.25]I think it's two.
[228:26.57]Help me out here, guys.
[228:27.87]This has to be a victory.
[228:29.29]I believe it's two.
[228:30.05]It's either two or three.
[228:37.18]Stop it with the emotes!
[228:38.86]And help me win the game.
[228:41.84]Is emote only mode actually turned on?
[228:44.81]What the fuck is going on?
[228:49.03]Why can't they help me?
[228:50.41]What, you turned them off?
[228:52.55]It's two.
[228:53.77]Got it.
[228:54.17]Didn't even need your help.
[228:55.73]I didn't even need Chat's help.
[228:59.72]The crow flaps its wings excitedly, tapping the weapon with its beak.
[229:03.64]Yes, this is perfect for acquaintance to the treasure or cave I will lead.
[229:09.74]Then it flies off into the forest.
[229:11.81]Tree by tree it flies like an inky black beacon leading you to a cave.
[229:17.69]Treasure awaits.
[229:21.15]If you find a shining scale, that is mine.
[229:25.14]Only appears in the night, it does.
[229:29.54]Beneath a fallen earring.
[229:33.00]He's not a fucking seagull.
[229:35.13]Beneath a fallen overhang of immense rock, you find a small opening leading to a treasure cave.
[229:40.48]I'm so sorry.
[229:41.16]That was fucking awful.
[229:44.68]Within the frozen cave is a singular large chest.
[229:47.52]Small animal bones litter the icy floor.
[229:50.74]Loot the chest.
[229:51.96]You throw open the lid to reveal a collection of trinkets and baubles.
[229:55.97]You got ten gold.
[229:57.63]You got ten food.
[229:59.59]And you got three encounters.
[230:02.89]Oh, shit.
[230:03.41]Okay.
[230:05.79]That doesn't matter.
[230:09.28]You can just see everything.
[230:10.98]More food.
[230:12.96]Tons of gold.
[230:16.10]Within the frozen cave, is it looted again?
[230:17.62]Oh.
[230:18.46]Okay, go somewhere else.
[230:21.06]The hours pass.
[230:23.66]Find the pawn, find the talking crow, keep moving.
[230:27.28]This is a long encounter card.
[230:28.87]Holy shit.
[230:31.36]It is night.
[230:31.80]Keep going.
[230:32.12]It's your companion's main questline?
[231:00.44]Yeah, I mean... The other guy's questline... It was like over the course of like five cards.
[231:08.01]This is the first questline card for this guy.
[231:10.05]I think it's because it... I think it's because it's been dipped in chocolate.
[231:12.91]That's why it's worth more.
[231:15.67]You know?
[231:17.05]I think that's why.
[231:18.57]You move through the trees, shivering, finding only more dense forests.
[231:20.97]He warns you not to stray too far.
[231:23.99]You try to keep moving through the pits, sharp pains wrack your limbs.
[231:26.67]Alright, so what?
[231:27.17]Just go back to the pond?
[231:30.46]Try to find the pond again.
[231:31.40]I don't understand.
[231:35.83]We just have to survive the night.
[231:42.23]Got it.
[231:46.17]Drink from the pond.
[231:47.86]Crack open the ice.
[231:49.28]It freezes your blood.
[231:52.94]What?
[231:53.38]I thought this was a healing pond.
[231:57.62]What is this?
[231:58.26]Alcohol?
[232:00.21]Explore somewhere else.
[232:01.03]Okay, it's getting harder and harder to be alive.
[232:10.72]The hours pass.
[232:12.74]Sharp pains rack you.
[232:14.80]Oh my god.
[232:16.30]Okay, can we find that shrine?
[232:17.98]What are we doing?
[232:21.83]Can we find the talking crow?
[232:23.69]No, go back to the pond.
[232:34.22]Just drink from the dirty pond again Alright drink Take some strength.
[232:43.20]We managed to crack open the ice and scoop a handful.
[232:44.90]The water is so cold.
[232:45.58]It freezes your blood Minus 15, but it's okay.
[232:48.46]We get plus we get plus 20 25.
[232:50.00]We just gained a little bit of health Drink from it again Freezes your blood
[232:57.88]I think we can just sit here and chug this, right?
[233:03.12]Drink again.
[233:06.49]Minus 5 life.
[233:08.91]And plus 20.
[233:09.25]Just drink again.
[233:15.15]I'm going to do this until we get to 100%.
[233:16.00]80.
[233:16.02]Drink again. 5.
[233:27.56]20.
[233:27.84]Alright, we're good.
[233:29.34]Let's keep going.
[233:31.59]Try to keep moving, um... Pain.
[233:33.73]There it is.
[233:35.93]It is night.
[233:36.41]Try to find the pawn.
[233:37.11]Try to find the shrine.
[233:42.78]The shrine, I guess?
[233:48.88]18.
[233:49.20]That's a beauty right there.
[233:50.16]Do I get anything for a perfect roll?
[233:56.48]I drank all the pond water.
[233:58.51]Alright, we're going to give three golden prey.
[234:03.89]There's a mournful sound of wooden flutes in the distance, and suddenly before you stands a spectral figure, a woman with no eyes.
[234:10.93]Colby continues to bow his head in prayer.
[234:12.47]He seems unperturbed by this sudden apparition.
[234:17.17]Barefoot with a thin shawl clutched around her, she stands before you and speaks in a deep voice, each word ringing out like a gong.
[234:26.85]Stab myself and pray.
[234:29.68]Feeling strangely compelled, you take the dagger from your belt and drive it hard into your stomach.
[234:50.77]The spirit smiles as your blood splatters onto the snow.
[234:53.31]Immediately you feel the frost touch the wound.
[234:55.87]The ghost blesses you as it fades away.
[235:01.31]Okay.
[235:02.83]Uh, gain.
[235:05.47]Draw a gain card at the beginning of each new map.
[235:08.07]If it is an equipment card, then keep it, otherwise discard it.
[235:13.19]Can I go home now?
[235:18.45]How do I get out of here?
[235:21.70]Try to find the treasure cave.
[235:26.93]It is night.
[235:27.41]How do I go to bed?
[235:28.43]How do we stay alive?
[235:31.45]How do we leave?
[235:40.95]Back to the bones.
[235:42.21]I hope you have learned to be their master.
[235:44.75]Can I really do the whole thing?
[235:45.89]No, fuck.
[235:52.17]I'm a deep shit here.
[235:54.17]I gotta get lucky with this.
[235:55.23]I really do.
[235:58.15]Come on!
[236:00.07]UGH!
[236:03.08]Come on!
[236:04.46]Shit!
[236:05.96]Shit!
[236:06.40]Fuck!
[236:06.94]Asshole!
[236:07.50]No!
[236:08.36]Ugh!
[236:14.44]A crow cocks his head.
[236:15.40]There's the crow.
[236:16.72]Give him an equipment.
[236:18.67]Here, take this dumb shitty sword that I don't want.
[236:46.35]I get... What the fuck?
[236:51.82]So how am I supposed to even do this now?
[236:55.16]I have to, like, sleep in that cave.
[236:58.22]I'm gonna die here.
[237:00.06]I'm gonna die.
[237:13.09]God fucking dammit.
[237:21.50]Lord in all heaven You've lost your bearings the hours past Do I just have to I Don't know I don't what how do I I need to go to bed as a lot that break did wait I win The elder should find us soon.
[237:44.67]I Go to the pond and fucking drink
[237:56.21]Drink from the pond.
[237:59.61]They numb your wounds.
[238:01.37]Okay, we're good.
[238:04.46]Let's drink from the pond again.
[238:05.54]25 health.
[238:08.38]We're back up to max.
[238:09.96]Okay, we're good.
[238:11.60]Explore.
[238:14.14]We just have to keep moving around.
[238:16.31]We're looking for the elder.
[238:20.43]Here we are.
[238:22.12]As day breaks, the elder of Clan Eyebright greets you with a tin cup of steaming tea.
[238:26.86]You gulp it down quickly, sighing, with relief as the elixir's warmth spreads through your whole body.
[238:32.46]The ancestors have judged you worthy.
[238:34.30]And he's wrinkly.
[238:38.28]And I got eight fame.
[238:39.42]And I got the token.
[238:41.63]Jesus.
[238:43.31]The elder watches a small bird alights on the tree beside him.
[238:47.42]Okay, um...
[239:11.53]Let me camp here for a second.
[239:14.39]Yeah, well, I haven't had... Dude, I spent, like, all night.
[239:22.50]All night, literally.
[239:24.34]Walking in circles.
[239:25.50]What do you have for equipment?
[239:26.64]Humble Hammer.
[239:27.40]Fucking 49.
[239:33.44]Goddammit.
[239:36.16]Well.
[239:37.57]Can't really do anything about this.
[239:38.71]It's okay.
[239:40.19]Go for the clues.
[239:44.08]Everyone's worked for him for a long time.
[239:47.58]Who's the guy?
[239:48.24]Griffin said they worked for him for a long time.
[239:50.66]Griffin makes wild accusations.
[239:52.46]Wait, who's the guy that tells the truth when he's drunk?
[239:55.26]Borden will spill more truth when he's drunk.
[239:58.22]Okay.
[240:02.29]Do something else.
[240:03.15]Break camp.
[240:05.88]We just have to go, keep going.
[240:07.30]There's only one way to go.
[240:08.32]Goblins.
[240:10.26]Uh, you've been ambushed.
[240:12.52]You turn to see a few goblins running away, giggling and pointing at you.
[240:16.68]With no time to check what it was stolen, you rush after the thieving devils.
[240:19.45]Defeat the goblins before they blow their horn and escape.
[240:23.33]Some highwaymen emerge from the bushes to protect the goblins.
[240:26.63]Thieves Guild.
[240:28.99]That's fantastic.
[240:33.15]Three nights until the assassination.
[240:35.11]I need to find out who did what.
[240:41.62]Diablo treasure goblins.
[240:43.66]This sucks.
[240:44.08]Well, isn't that just wonderful?
[241:01.36]I'm not losing it.
[241:02.20]I'm not losing a single drop.
[241:09.84]Come here.
[241:10.06]Come here.
[241:10.42]Come here.
[241:11.44]Get over here.
[241:18.91]Don't let him get away.
[241:23.25]One more.
[241:24.97]I don't even care about taking hits.
[241:25.98]I'm not losing on my items.
[241:31.75]Dead.
[241:32.49]Okay, we got it.
[241:36.38]Goblins can't escape because they're all dead.
[241:45.60]You can't run away!
[241:46.50]Did you say somebody has a golden Kappa?
[241:57.65]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[241:58.77]Rock, paper, scissors.
[242:00.05]My guy was dead the whole time.
[242:02.44]Yeah, not a single drop of gold was lost.
[242:04.00]I have nothing!
[242:08.64]I have like 37 gold!
[242:12.50]Unfortunately, your coin purse feels a little lighter, the thieving devils.
[242:15.43]Did one of them make a bite from a pasty in your haversack?
[242:20.75]What?
[242:23.51]Search for valuables.
[242:24.33]At least I got an equipment card.
[242:26.87]And the thing that... Okay.
[242:30.31]The thing that I was going to buy for 40-something gold is here for free.
[242:35.03]Humble Hammer.
[242:36.12]Slam.
[242:36.52]Perform a strike that causes damage to an area when activated.
[242:39.30]Deals 120% damage for every enemy hit.
[242:43.18]Weapon deals less damage the higher the welder's fame.
[242:47.94]Okay.
[242:49.86]And it's a heavy weapon.
[242:50.62]Let's put it on.
[242:54.23]Got some food back.
[242:54.93]Can I get some money too?
[242:55.59]No.
[242:55.89]No.
[242:59.04]Elder's Gift.
[243:00.36]Alright, so this is... I get it.
[243:10.00]So if you put a platinum card in your deck, you have to put a platinum item, too.
[243:15.20]So this is... You just put these in here.
[243:16.60]This is how you get the... I get it.
[243:17.92]Okay.
[243:19.94]I got eight fame.
[243:21.50]I don't... I did not want that.
[243:22.84]That's making my item... My item's gonna be useless.
[243:26.53]Once again, we return to the inn, seeking clues to save a life.
[243:31.75]Let's go into the inn.
[243:32.45]When we look into memories, so many things are left unsaid.
[243:37.31]Here we go.
[243:39.39]Why this life?
[243:42.38]Why this inn?
[243:45.38]You enter the Mulberry Inn and find Father Gaffrey at his usual table by the fireplace.
[243:51.36]You sit down across from him.
[243:53.27]He scratches some numbers on one of many rolls of paper strewn across the table, then glances up at you.
[244:01.62]Three days until the assassin comes for me, and three suspects.
[244:06.10]How appropriate.
[244:07.48]Three days to uncover the liar.
[244:11.36]I would like you to follow one of my silencers on a job, trading trusts for information.
[244:17.20]Pay for what it is if you must.
[244:21.11]Okay, um... We're gonna go with Borden.
[244:25.49]Borden is going to pick up some lamps from Shipwrecked Port that have been, let's say, repossessed from their owners.
[244:33.86]This guy, you get this guy, gotta get this guy drunk.
[244:36.44]You note the meeting point on your map and retire for the night.
[244:39.66]The Guild.
[244:57.21]So I need to go that way.
[244:58.87]Wait, what?
[245:05.37]I need to go to the guild, right?
[245:06.57]I only have two days until he dies.
[245:08.97]Should I explore first?
[245:13.03]Probably.
[245:15.97]I'm gonna look around.
[245:21.59]Down.
[245:25.05]No, keep exploring.
[245:28.98]What about over here?
[245:30.60]General Store.
[245:31.46]Perfect.
[245:33.82]What do you got?
[245:36.48]Extinguisher.
[245:38.36]Fire is 40% less effective.
[245:40.50]Okay.
[245:43.76]Berserker's Creed.
[245:46.88]Deal more damage the more life you lose in combat.
[245:49.55]And you get extra gold.
[245:53.04]Okay.
[245:54.08]That's kind of cool.
[245:54.62]What about this?
[245:56.72]Weakened block.
[245:57.62]Bash an enemy in block or remove their armor to cause a brief stun.
[246:02.76]After every encounter with a gambit, reveal one random encounter card.
[246:07.45]Okay.
[246:10.29]Or the cardinal blade, which I can't use.
[246:14.07]Let's go with... Let's go with this one.
[246:19.01]Let's try to do it.
[246:19.47]I'm going to put this on.
[246:27.11]The power Rage grants is often misunderstood.
[246:30.02]I got food.
[246:31.46]I got plenty of food.
[246:32.32]I don't need any healing.
[246:34.98]Sell equipment.
[246:35.56]Can I sell anything now?
[246:37.02]I can sell the soldier's sword.
[246:38.10]Yeah, just get rid of it.
[246:44.74]How do I get the token from this?
[246:46.12]I have no idea.
[246:46.76]Alright, let's leap.
[246:57.25]Cartographer.
[246:58.67]A traveling cartographer in the process of making the first full map... I'll wait till he's done.
[247:08.71]A traveling cartographer in the process of making the first full map of the Empire wishes to pay you gold for information on areas you have seen in your recent travels.
[247:17.54]I need not know every stream or stone that lies from here to the capital.
[247:21.22]I'm sure whatever knowledge you can provide will be some worth.
[247:24.42]There are four revealed encounters on the map.
[247:27.88]um except eight gold is payment for your information uh or I could I'm assuming I'll just come back no because I I guess I guess you have to do them all first right just take uh just give me the money give me that money
[247:52.69]You spend several hours in his company until he is satisfied that you have nothing else useful to add.
[247:56.83]You gotta explore the whole thing.
[247:57.92]I'm gonna have to come back like a different time.
[248:01.08]So that one, you need to explore every single spot and then land on this card, right?
[248:07.56]I guess.
[248:08.58]More goblins.
[248:09.46]Cool.
[248:12.95]Oh no, not this shit.
[248:16.65]That's a lot of people.
[248:18.23]I'm gonna lose some items here.
[248:27.43]chat got exhausted after spamming everybody was like hashing down like mashing their keyboard whoa what the is going on right now what weapons do I have equipped what's going on what the is happening I'm serious what what weapons do I have on did I put these on

[249:11.85]Die!
[249:14.41]He's dead.
[249:14.93]Got it.
[249:18.51]What?
[249:18.69]I blocked that.
[249:19.21]Oh my fucking god, easy here.
[249:20.55]I'm gonna like, die.
[249:26.46]My guy is dead.
[249:33.82]Bring him back.
[249:34.24]Why not?

[249:36.78]Okay, don't fuck around here.
[249:38.12]I like, I got two like con- I'm gonna shut the fuck up right now.
[249:49.85]You dickhead!
[249:51.85]Ugh!
[249:52.01]He, I fucking, he was blocking my dodge!
[249:55.11]Ugh!
[250:00.30]That runs over.
[250:01.76]Un-fucking-believable.
[250:05.00]Oh, my fucking god.
[250:09.08]I was too busy just, like, spamming X, like, dashing around in circles.
[250:13.29]Oh, what a fucking idiot.
[250:16.01]Well, I'm gonna do this again.
[250:18.19]Goddamn gracious.
[250:18.69]That's so irritating.
[250:31.97]Give me this thing.
[250:32.53]Give me the watchtower.
[250:35.41]Get rid of this card.
[250:36.11]This is useless.
[250:37.25]Unless I put in the axe.
[250:42.15]Let's see.
[250:43.29]That's like an easy stupid one that doesn't matter.
[250:46.00]This one.
[250:46.36]The fucking pie one.
[250:47.26]Who cares?
[250:47.70]Get rid of that.
[250:57.34]Get rid of that too.
[250:58.06]I don't like that thing.
[251:08.99]I haven't seen what those do.
[251:12.61]Alright, let's go.
[251:18.96]Honestly though, what weapon did I even have on?
[251:22.88]What was that?
[251:26.77]You have to start over from the very beginning of the whole encounter.
[251:29.05]That's how it works, apparently.
[251:30.65]A new assassin has been determined.
[251:31.93]It was an axe?
[251:32.37]Okay.
[251:32.57]Yeah, the Borden... These are the names.
[251:33.93]I know the names.
[251:56.49]uh I think when I think that changes let's see no alright so all the information is the same that's good to know so always this girl the girl always tell the truth for money uh this is the guy that when he he's drunk he makes wild accusations uh alright let's see if we can get in that there's the note retire let's go
[252:24.80]Berta's Bedding House.
[252:26.32]Uh, beside a busy Empire Road you spy a ramshackle stall whereupon a few ramshackle people are seated on stools rolling dice.
[252:37.69]You approach the stall and behind the table is a little girl practicing on a poorly tuned violin.
[252:43.23]Beside her waits a squat lady clad in a flowery apron.
[252:47.28]Welcome, have a seat.
[252:48.64]Do try the spice cakes, I baked them for this morning.
[252:52.21]Birda smiles at you warmly.
[252:54.21]What would you like to play?
[252:55.23]I've got dice, I've got cards, and buckets of coins for winnings.
[252:59.27]Uh, let's play... You pull up a stool between two gamblers, smiling as you sit down.
[253:05.32]Pretending to be interested in their card game, you attempt to pick their pockets.
[253:12.10]Oh lord.
[253:15.74]Can you even get the gold?
[253:17.58]Okay, there it is.
[253:18.12]Ring...
[253:25.24]I'll get it.
[253:28.54]Oh, it changes erratically.
[253:31.86]There we go.
[253:32.32]Right.
[253:37.95]Got it.
[253:41.61]Father Galfrey's pointers pay off and you managed to pull a purse heavy with gold.
[253:45.53]15 gold.
[253:46.91]20 gold.
[253:47.37]Alright.
[253:52.51]Games remaining today.
[253:53.73]Three.
[253:54.37]Let's play dice.
[253:55.29]And let's bet 18 gold.
[254:01.21]Remember, Poppet, it's double or nothing.
[254:03.05]Berta hands you three well-worn dice.
[254:05.03]If your third roll is the highest, you'll win enough to buy your sweetheart something from the market.
[254:10.20]Let's do it.
[254:16.38]Nine.
[254:17.62]What does that mean?
[254:18.74]Well done.
[254:20.30]You continue to impress.
[254:22.39]Now for your second roll.
[254:23.45]Roll higher than 8 on your third and final roll.
[254:26.11]Ooh!
[254:33.76]Smoked it!
[254:36.64]This is your last roll.
[254:38.38]The grubby gamblers beside you watch on eagerly.
[254:40.60]Roll higher than 12 on your third roll.
[254:44.92]Come on!
[254:48.43]It's okay.
[254:53.50]This is gonna be it.
[254:55.28]Oh, you fuck!
[254:57.54]Oh!
[254:57.94]I forgot, I forgot.
[254:58.62]I have, like, my best friend.
[255:00.66]I get to cheat in this game.
[255:06.28]I win.
[255:09.38]Congratulations, dear.
[255:10.32]You've won 36 gold.
[255:13.94]Alright.
[255:14.94]What about cards?
[255:16.52]How much are you looking to bet?
[255:17.46]These are our rates today.
[255:18.28]Let's just do a conservative bet of 5 gold.
[255:22.88]No.
[255:28.76]Hey, that's how you make out on your investment.
[255:32.56]They got $65 now.
[255:35.26]Burda insists on pressing a few roasted chestnuts into your hand before you go.
[255:40.10]Well, thank you.
[255:42.17]Didn't learn any new clues.
[255:44.43]Keep exploring.
[255:48.77]Burning building.
[255:49.55]This is a potential coin here.
[255:50.49]You hear shouting up ahead as you make your way down the cobbled street.
[255:53.73]You see lights flickering on the road in front of you.
[256:07.46]As you approach, you see a building, flames and smoke billowing out of its upper room windows.
[256:13.45]A crowd has formed outside, passing buckets of water between one another to temper the blaze.
[256:18.87]As you push your way through the crowd, you see a woman frantically pleading to the villagers.
[256:25.83]Help me.
[256:26.33]My family's in there.
[256:27.12]Anyone, please help me.
[256:28.98]I'm here.
[256:31.51]The fuck is this?
[256:32.97]What?
[256:34.32]I don't get it.
[256:36.06]What do I need to... What do I want to land on here?
[256:45.87]How do I... What point do I need to be... I don't even understand how this was even played.
[256:54.85]I didn't even know.
[256:55.59]I didn't even know what the fuck was going on.
[256:58.67]Apparently, you have to stop it, and it stopped, and I lose.
[257:06.92]Come on, you can't give me that shit.
[257:09.92]Every single wheel that has ever existed, you stop the wheel, and it goes like, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, guk, and that's what it lands on.
[257:21.51]It just, ah, stop.
[257:22.77]I didn't know that.
[257:23.47]Now I know.
[257:25.69]Now the smoke is too thick and you find yourself disoriented, eyes burning, you fumble out of the building and... Wait, what?
[257:32.24]The woman sees you emerge empty-handed and the woman lets out a cry.
[257:36.04]My husband!
[257:37.08]Did you see my husband?
[257:38.56]He's still in there, please help me!
[257:40.74]The dealer adds another Life is Pain card to the wheel of Gambit.
[257:45.68]Let's try it again.
[257:46.20]Alright, so right when you see... It's gotta be... Now.
[257:55.06]Injury pain.
[258:01.20]Oh, no.
[258:03.48]Sorry, I didn't save your husband.
[258:05.87]I'm just continuously... I'll go back in.
[258:07.85]I'm gonna go back in.
[258:12.41]Oh, shit.
[258:19.13]I didn't see him.
[258:20.15]I didn't see him.
[258:22.62]Let me try again.
[258:23.56]Wait, what?
[258:24.82]As you exit the building, it collapses behind you.
[258:26.86]While you are unable to save everyone, the villagers are grateful for your valiant effort.
[258:34.17]I got real famous for running into a burning building four times.
[258:39.55]Okay.
[258:41.95]We need to buy food.
[258:43.29]Bad.
[258:46.13]Ten food.
[258:47.77]I'm gonna buy ten food.
[258:53.35]And we're also going to buy equipment.
[258:56.61]Here we go.
[258:57.39]Let's see.
[258:58.27]Corrupted inflicts 25% less damage.
[259:02.19]You lose one max life instead of taking starvation damage.
[259:07.45]Interesting.
[259:08.67]What does more damage?
[259:10.36]18.
[259:10.38]18.
[259:11.74]I like this one.
[259:13.14]I think I'm going to get the card level 8.
[259:16.30]Or what about...
[259:19.76]I don't have enough food to make this worthwhile.
[259:22.64]I want the blade.
[259:23.14]I like this thing.
[259:27.74]This thing's good.
[259:31.05]Okay, um... Can I buy any healing?
[259:34.29]Nope.
[259:36.49]I mean, I can sell the axes and stuff, but... Maybe I should.
[259:43.95]I mean, I have the armor already.
[259:44.99]Let's just get rid of this shit.
[259:51.01]Still, I need to understand how this token works.
[259:54.05]So that's how I... If you riposte 25 northerners by attacking them, you unlock that token.
[260:00.04]That's cool.
[260:01.78]For another time.
[260:02.38]So now... Let me look at my inventory.
[260:10.19]So I didn't have that on.
[260:11.13]Okay.
[260:13.91]What was I going to do?
[260:14.43]Healing, right?
[260:16.31]Let's just get 10 health.
[260:20.55]Cool.
[260:22.27]Cool.
[260:23.39]Leave.
[260:25.15]Let's have this time not instantly lose and die because I'm a moron.
[260:30.67]Enter the inn.
[260:32.73]Here we are.
[260:33.19]We're going to go with the guy that you make him drunk and he tells the truth.
[260:39.18]This is the guy that when he drinks, he tells the truth.
[260:43.28]He's going to pick up some lamps from the port and go to the port.
[260:49.76]You note the meeting point on your map and retire for the night.
[260:52.76]There it is.
[260:59.13]Equip my equipables.
[261:00.49]They are already equipped.
[261:03.77]See, cardinal blade.
[261:04.59]Already got it.
[261:07.03]Wooden shield, already got it.
[261:08.51]And I only have this.
[261:11.64]I don't want to put on these things.
[261:13.24]I'm going to keep the cardinal blade.
[261:18.29]Please equip the new sword.
[261:19.39]What do you mean?
[261:20.11]It gets... You equip it.
[261:23.45]Once you open it, once you unlock it, you can equip it immediately.
[261:25.69]See?
[261:32.17]Yep.
[261:33.09]Yep, yep, yep.
[261:33.73]Let's go.
[261:33.96]New card.
[261:34.96]Winter Solstice.
[261:35.60]This looks interesting.
[261:45.70]On the longest night of winter, the townsfolk of Steigl set up around a huge bonfire to celebrate the victory of light over darkness.
[261:52.98]The one night the Empire turns a blind eye to the outlawed use of magic.
[261:57.12]You join a group of peasants close to the fire.
[261:59.27]Taking a sip, the woman beside you offers a goblet.
[262:02.11]You politely accept the pungent potion and take a quick swig.
[262:05.57]Warmth rushes through your body, and you fall into a deep, hypnotic trance as you stare into the dancing flames.
[262:12.98]You wake to find yourself in a stable nestled among a herd of cows.
[262:19.25]On your way out, you spot a few unconscious empire guards huddled together outside the stable.
[262:24.79]No blessing cards found in the inventory.
[262:28.13]So, do you just get shit stolen from you, or what?
[262:32.88]Goblins.
[262:33.46]Great.
[262:35.76]Uh-huh.
[262:37.82]Mm-hmm.
[262:41.39]This one has the annoying goblins.
[262:46.35]Getting turnt with cows.
[262:48.17]I'm so fucking sorry about that.
[262:53.38]Accepting drinks from a random dude.
[262:55.04]Wait, hold on.
[262:55.66]Why not?
[262:59.38]I'm confused right now.
[263:03.50]Why is my sword not on?
[263:05.14]It was equipped in the menu.
[263:06.51]I just had it on.
[263:07.39]This is not it.
[263:12.35]Is this... I'm so fucking confused.
[263:25.74]Oh, these guys are like dressed... This guy didn't even have anything.
[263:29.00]They're gonna get away with a bunch of shit.
[263:32.10]I'm like not even paying attention.
[263:34.28]Oh, the fucking goblins have it.
[263:35.80]Oh, god damn it.
[263:37.00]What a crock of shit.
[263:41.93]I'm trying to figure out what the hell is going on.
[263:43.37]You took it out of my hand.
[263:49.69]Oh my lord.
[263:52.36]Getting so distracted by that.
[263:54.02]I thought the game was like broken.
[263:55.46]And no, no, no, no.
[263:56.20]They took the sword out of my hand.
[264:06.92]Fuck these pyromancer enemies.
[264:08.64]When there's like more than two or three of them.
[264:09.94]They have such a pain.
[264:10.89]Did I die?
[264:14.06]I lost... I got one guy out of two.
[264:22.06]And I lost my sword.
[264:26.33]Oh, good.
[264:26.65]I take my cardinal blade.
[264:28.33]Thank God he was one of the guys that had it.
[264:33.21]They took my gold.
[264:36.13]Oh, fuck those enemies.
[264:40.23]I guess I'm going to put this on.
[264:48.02]Well, okay, so... Nothing terrible happened.
[264:53.11]Nothing awful happened there.
[264:54.85]I gotta camp.
[264:59.75]Let's make some food.
[265:04.70]Not that much, though.
[265:09.74]Go down.
[265:11.50]Here we go.
[265:11.92]Cakes, pies, and lies.
[265:14.78]So, buy pie, buy lies.
[265:16.38]I don't think I have enough money for this.
[265:18.56]How much is a pie?
[265:21.21]Vegetable pie?
[265:21.85]It smells of herbs.
[265:24.35]Pies have been selling steadily.
[265:25.51]Chester considers this coin chest for a while.
[265:27.33]Before he finally decides on a price.
[265:30.19]God damn it.
[265:30.93]It doesn't even matter.
[265:31.93]I can't even do it.
[265:35.05]Decline the purchase.
[265:38.09]I can't even do it.
[265:40.61]This is return to the inn.
[265:41.57]No, keep exploring.
[265:43.60]The guild.
[265:44.58]So we need to pay attention here.
[265:46.88]Shipwreck ports.
[265:48.74]Only two knights.
[265:49.78]Hopefully this guy's the killer.
[265:51.64]Okay, you travel to shipwreck port by wagon.
[265:56.20]You ride in relative silence until Borden turns to you and asks quite seriously...
[266:12.83]What do you think of the boss?
[266:15.27]Tell him that you are proud to be working under such a great man.
[266:18.87]Tell him that you find Father Galfrey hard to read.
[266:23.93]Hard to read.
[266:25.81]God fucking dammit.
[266:28.95]Who trusts their boss?
[266:30.56]Nobody does.
[266:33.02]What do you think of the boss?
[266:34.48]Ah, like he sucks.
[266:35.42]That's what everybody says.
[266:36.44]Nobody likes the guy they're working for.
[266:40.93]At the port, you are approached by a pirate bearing a load of stolen lamps.
[266:44.91]Borden goes to give him a sack of gold, presumably payment.
[266:49.51]The usually pale pirate shakes his head.
[266:51.25]No.
[266:52.83]He pulls out a rusty bucket and his sword.
[266:55.55]I want blood.
[266:57.11]Theirs.
[266:58.64]Borden looks at you expectantly, as if you shouldn't protest.
[267:07.00]Fine.
[267:08.92]I'm just, like, cutting myself for this guy?
[267:13.74]Borden trusts you a little more.
[267:15.12]Hey, thanks for cutting your body and bleeding into a bucket for me.
[267:18.80]Thanks, man.
[267:19.22]Appreciate it.
[267:23.16]You retrieve the crates of stolen lamps and pile them onto the wagon before setting off.
[267:28.43]When you arrive at the drop-off point, Borden is seized with a sudden emotion.
[267:33.67]I'm sorry I asked you to give blood.
[267:35.95]I'm a terrible person, aren't I?
[267:39.50]Tell him that he is quite a terrible person.
[267:41.26]Comfort him.
[267:47.25]This one's not hard.
[267:52.60]You're not a terrible person.
[267:56.22]Borden trusts you a little more.
[267:58.82]Borden wrings his hands as if he would very much like to leave.
[268:03.07]I should go.
[268:05.77]What's your favorite food?
[268:08.39]Ask about his family, ask about his past.
[268:14.47]What's his favorite food?
[268:18.08]Uh, Blackberry Tart.
[268:18.94]Or maybe Apple Tart.
[268:19.80]I don't know.
[268:20.82]Borden begins to sweat, seemingly from the pressure of the question.
[268:26.98]Borden... I should go.
[268:28.57]Blackberry Tart?
[268:31.49]Ask about his family.
[268:34.25]I don't know if I should be telling you that kind of thing.
[268:39.45]This guy doesn't take bribes.
[268:42.48]Uh... Ask about his past.
[268:46.89]What do you think about Father Galfry?
[268:48.91]The boss always makes sure we get our cut.
[268:50.87]You can't ask for any better, really, in a guild of scoundrels like us.
[268:56.51]Doesn't he trust me?
[268:59.13]He didn't know there was going to be a quiz.
[269:00.93]Alright, passed.
[269:02.21]Five gold.
[269:03.43]He nervously takes your money.
[269:06.67]Goddammit.
[269:07.55]I only have two die for this.
[269:11.91]No, I don't.
[269:12.47]Three.
[269:14.30]They all suck.
[269:15.44]I should just redo the whole damn thing.
[269:19.51]Redo the whole damn thing.
[269:20.67]No.
[269:22.15]Yeah.
[269:22.59]These are all fucking awful.
[269:26.91]And it's even fucking worse.
[269:29.29]Come on.
[269:29.65]Oh, fucking God.
[269:32.26]I hate my life.
[269:33.04]Okay, bye.
[269:45.37]He didn't tell me anything.
[269:46.89]I couldn't do anything.
[269:50.32]Fucking rolling dice to get a question answered so I can beat the game.
[269:56.58]There he is at his table.
[269:58.76]He glances up at you.
[269:59.82]I hope the job was a fruitful.
[270:01.14]You're not dead with a knife in your back.
[270:03.22]Hey, make sure you get him drunk at work, which you can't do.
[270:12.40]Tomorrow, who will you follow?
[270:14.95]Okay, who's the one that... I don't have any money.
[270:19.30]Grendan.
[270:20.84]Talk about your goblin problem, Grendan.
[270:25.80]I've told Grendan to stake out the castle by Moorhammer Lake for any movement in or out.
[270:30.58]The lady of the castle owes us a considerable debt.
[270:35.94]You know the meeting point on your map.
[270:40.08]I think I'm going to go right for it.
[270:42.51]At this point, I'm kind of fucked.
[270:46.44]No camp.
[270:46.84]I don't have any money.
[270:48.63]Market thief.
[270:49.41]Here it is again.
[270:52.01]I just have to... I don't have any money.
[270:54.39]He can't steal anything.
[270:55.35]I just have to get it right.
[270:57.21]The guy bumps into me.
[270:58.77]He pickpockets nothing.
[271:00.84]Okay, he took one food.
[271:02.48]That actually is bad.
[271:05.22]Where did he go?
[271:15.46]I don't know.
[271:16.71]I lost it on the second... I lost it on the second dart.
[271:21.61]I would say here.
[271:23.93]One of these two.
[271:24.91]I think it's two.
[271:29.60]Nope.
[271:32.50]It was three.
[271:33.04]It wasn't one or two.
[271:38.19]Everybody's screaming two in the chat.
[271:40.53]It wasn't correct.
[271:41.73]A simple part of every story, especially a tale spent in the company of allies and boon companions.
[271:48.97]Friendly innkeeper, give me something here.
[271:51.39]As night draws in, you return to the Rusty Razor.
[271:53.26]The proprietor greets you warmly.
[271:55.54]What can I provide to the savior of the Rusty Razor?
[272:00.32]Rumors.
[272:01.98]The innkeeper tells you that the recent cheese festival has kept the inn busy and his coffers full.
[272:07.23]That's not what I want.
[272:07.81]I'm looking for clues.
[272:09.69]I don't care about your cheese festival.
[272:14.47]Looking for lodgings, eh?
[272:15.55]Your friend here seems like they could do with the rest.
[272:18.12]It's free, of course, assuming you have some provisions.
[272:22.12]I don't have anything.
[272:24.62]Okay, leave.
[272:26.20]I'm not going to be able to get anything out of anybody.
[272:29.06]Now I'm taking 10 damage.
[272:30.20]And now here are goblins.
[272:32.43]Shit.
[272:34.21]And they're going to steal things.
[272:39.45]Oh my lord.
[272:40.27]I take 10 damage a step now because I have no food.
[272:45.43]Oh my god.
[272:48.40]I think this might be a boss.
[272:56.54]I'm pretty sure it is.
[273:01.20]Hopefully they didn't take my sword.
[273:04.80]So many people here too.
[273:05.96]This is awful.
[273:06.66]It is a new enemy type.
[273:08.46]Cut your throat or cut your purse.
[273:09.84]It makes no mind to them.
[273:11.27]Silencer.
[273:13.41]I don't have any weapons.
[273:19.33]Come here.
[273:21.68]Get over here.
[273:22.18]They're just running in a fucking circle.
[273:24.20]Fuck you guys.
[273:27.85]7 damage.
[273:28.57]This guy has my sword.
[273:30.61]This guy has my fucking sword on his back.
[273:33.51]Dead?
[273:34.95]Thank god.
[273:42.40]Give me back my stuff.
[273:48.95]At least one of them is going to get away.
[273:50.61]Whatever.
[273:54.77]Maybe not.
[273:56.27]Oh, get the fuck over there, dude.
[273:57.87]Just get out of the way.
[273:59.75]He's gone.
[274:01.33]Whatever.
[274:03.27]I'm glad I get to use my toothpicks to fight people and not hurt them.
[274:16.06]My super move does 10 damage.
[274:18.32]That's fantastic.
[274:27.78]Come here.
[274:35.56]Ow.
[274:37.58]Why am I surrendering?
[274:38.68]What?
[274:40.39]I'm not surrendering.
[274:44.11]Is this a tabletop game or an action RPG?
[274:46.15]It's a combination of both.
[274:48.11]It is a card game.
[274:48.95]It is a deck building game.
[274:50.43]It is an RPG.
[274:51.13]It's an action game.
[274:52.53]It's a tabletop game.
[274:53.59]It's everything.
[274:56.11]You got my cardinal blade.
[274:58.65]They've stolen all your food.
[275:00.49]Even the stale pie you were planning to throw away.
[275:04.69]Well.
[275:07.29]At least I have this stuff still on.
[275:09.49]Don't I get food?
[275:10.57]What does this do?
[275:11.25]Hold on.
[275:13.62]Receive plus one food for every gained food or gained gold card you receive.
[275:16.88]I need to get some money.
[275:21.14]I have to do it.
[275:21.84]I can't do it.
[275:22.60]I have to.
[275:23.04]I have 20 health.
[275:27.41]Yeah, I have this nice sword that I haven't got to use yet.
[275:30.97]With a shout, Grendan signals your arrival at the castle by Moorhammer Lake.
[275:35.35]You find some long grass and settle down for the day.
[275:38.45]Despite being a stakeout, Grendan happily talks quite loudly.
[275:42.45]You know, my sources tell me that the lady inside this wanted for high treason.
[275:48.12]He suddenly pulls out a bit of charcoal and paper.
[275:50.88]Would you like my autograph?
[275:53.33]Yes, absolutely.
[275:55.13]You allow him to scribble his name on the roll of paper.
[275:57.29]He tucks it lovingly into your hand.
[276:00.43]Grendan trusts you now.
[276:02.39]Time passes, but nobody leaves or enters the modest castle.
[276:06.80]I say, who are you anyway?
[276:09.50]Grendan retrieves a boiled sweet from a paper bag and pops it in his mouth.
[276:13.76]I've not seen you around before.
[276:17.30]Say you're a new recruit.
[276:18.50]Say you're the leader of the Thieves Guild in disguise.
[276:22.59]Well, I gotta beta male this guy, you know what I mean?
[276:26.55]No, I'm new.
[276:28.44]Yes, I would love your autograph.
[276:30.48]He's obviously an alpha male.
[276:34.42]Oh, really?
[276:35.00]I heard we didn't need any more recruits.
[276:38.25]That we're struggling to feed the mouths we already have.
[276:41.17]Grendan squints at you, suspiciously stroking his head.
[276:43.65]Tell me!
[276:44.72]What did you do to get recruited?
[276:48.84]Say that you stole the shoes off Father Galfrey while he was sleeping.
[276:52.56]Say that you stole the stars from the sky and put them in his eyes.
[277:00.21]The gaudy thief blushes.
[277:03.27]He trusts me more.
[277:06.01]Little else happens during the stakeout.
[277:07.85]You spend most of the time watching a dog sleep.
[277:11.41]Before you head your separate ways, you take the chance to question Grendan.
[277:15.74]Okay.
[277:19.18]He's gonna... We don't have to bribe him.
[277:21.18]We're in love.
[277:22.62]What's your favorite food?
[277:24.24]Aha!
[277:24.56]Great question!
[277:25.46]It would be berry pudding, without a doubt.
[277:27.24]Okay, berry pudding.
[277:31.08]What about your family?
[277:32.60]Who needs family when I have so many devoted followers?
[277:36.56]Okay, ask about his past.
[277:40.07]I was specifically asked to join the guild many moons ago after I slew a manticore only using a dagger with no shoes on.
[277:49.52]Rindon said that he joined the guild many moons ago and slew a manticore with no shoes on.
[277:58.18]Ask what he thinks of Father Galfrey.
[278:00.68]Father Galfrey?
[278:01.62]A dollar-ring old fool.
[278:02.90]I'm surprised he hasn't already been replaced by a younger, more dashing guild member.
[278:08.23]He's gone soft at his old age.
[278:09.75]The other day he let one of his... the rabble go free after they mucked up a job.
[278:14.87]No thumbs chopped off or nothing.
[278:17.47]Grandin is checking his appearance in the reflection of the blade.
[278:21.53]Goodbye.
[278:23.25]You wonder how much he told you is a lie.
[278:24.79]Well, you don't... Who cares?
[278:29.81]What clues did I learn about assassination attempts?
[278:31.97]The guy told a lie about how cool he was by killing a manticore.
[278:37.44]That guy's not the assassin.
[278:38.54]That guy's just a tool.
[278:42.62]I'm going to die.
[278:44.48]Enter the inn.
[278:46.90]I sit down across from him.
[278:48.30]I'm going to die in two moves.
[278:50.26]I need food now.
[278:53.42]For once, Father Gaffrey is merely sitting and staring silently at his papers.
[278:57.16]The quill is stationary in his hand.
[279:00.01]Tomorrow evening I may die.
[279:03.73]For the briefest moment, fatigue crosses his face.
[279:06.11]Father Gaffrey appears all at once very old.
[279:09.89]I hope you will know who the assassin is before then.
[279:15.65]Ask to borrow gold from the guild's coffers.
[279:17.45]Yes.
[279:18.67]I cannot.
[279:19.99]I'd have to lie on the guild's records.
[279:21.93]Father Gavrija was quivering shock at the suggestion.
[279:29.98]Go on a job with Rowena.
[279:33.28]Rowena has been tasked with kidnapping the child of Lady Fielding as they journey to the capital.
[279:39.02]I need to camp or something.
[279:42.13]The meeting point.
[279:42.95]Please have it be right in front of me.
[279:44.97]Shit.
[279:46.37]Oh, I'm dead.
[279:49.52]I can camp here, but I don't... I can't do anything.
[279:54.92]Trade.
[279:56.24]Here he comes.
[279:57.06]Buy food.
[279:58.96]I can't even buy one food.
[280:00.18]I have to sell a bunch of shit.
[280:02.79]Like, I have to sell... I gotta sell the armor.
[280:06.11]Have to.
[280:08.23]I gotta sell them both.
[280:10.79]Don't I?
[280:14.90]I can get three food.
[280:17.06]Oh my god.
[280:18.66]Hold on.
[280:22.36]I can buy some food.
[280:23.90]All is not lost yet.
[280:27.53]Let's catch up with some bits because somebody just gave $100.
[280:29.49]Bunnies.
[280:29.97]Bunnies gave $100.
[280:32.97]$10,000 bits.
[280:35.25]And they say, love you Jerm.
[280:35.99]Cheer $10,000.
[280:44.09]Well, now I have $100 to buy food.
[280:45.53]That would be nice.
[280:46.83]If it was, like, in the game, too.
[280:49.01]But... That's a huge... Thank you, bunnies.
[280:52.29]For your 100 fucking dollars.
[280:57.16]Love you, too.
[280:58.46]Love you back.
[281:00.72]Now I'm gonna immediately spend it on loot cases.
[281:06.62]But... In all honesty, that's... That's a large amount of money.
[281:12.83]For someone to give.
[281:13.43]So... Very much appreciate it, dude.
[281:16.30]Thank you so much.
[281:18.72]That's ten loot boxes.
[281:21.82]Much love, man.
[281:24.82]Okay, I thought somebody was just in, like, team speak.
[281:28.17]I don't know why I got scared of this.
[281:30.59]For a second, I thought somebody was in my computer.
[281:34.33]And they were just gonna fucking... They were just talking.
[281:36.55]And they were gonna take off my stream or something.

[283:01.20]At least it'll get me over there.
[283:04.50]And I can't fuck around.
[283:05.36]We can't explore.
[283:06.70]We have to just... I can camp and I can eat this food.
[283:13.21]No.
[283:14.09]No, I can't.
[283:15.73]I can't do it.
[283:17.05]We have to just go.
[283:19.01]Why would I do that?
[283:19.63]Gnomish exchange.
[283:21.89]Halt!
[283:22.01]No, no, no.
[283:23.45]I can do better than that.
[283:24.60]Gnomish exchange.
[283:25.64]A voice calls out as a dozen small creatures leap from the trees behind you.
[283:41.38]It takes a moment to realize they are gnomes, dirty, poorly armed gnomes.
[283:45.31]A few hold spears, but most have only a rock or a sharpened stick.
[283:50.73]We seek arms to defend ourselves, a gnome declares loudly.
[283:54.69]Hand over some of your equipment and we'll release you.
[283:57.57]We can even pay you something.
[284:00.97]I'll give you some food for a helmet, one of the small folk exclaims.
[284:03.83]No, give me some armor and I'll give you a health potion.
[284:06.95]The gnomes all loudly shout their own offers, trying to drown each other out.
[284:12.63]I'll give him something.
[284:14.15]No, do not give them that.
[284:17.83]Refuse!
[284:19.23]You refuse and the gnomes attack.
[284:20.85]A collection of sharp sticks and rocks fly in your direction.
[284:25.22]Oh!
[284:26.22]No!
[284:28.44]Now death comes to you.
[284:31.52]This story ends here.
[284:33.18]Hmm.
[284:47.18]Fucking gnomes.
[284:50.47]Not even gonna give me a chance card to... A chance... Ayayay.
[284:53.33]God damn it.
[284:56.31]Fuck.
[284:59.30]It... Dude, it told me that they had... Ayayay.
[285:01.94]Oh, well.
[285:04.12]This one's hard.
[285:12.35]One last attempt here.
[285:13.77]One more try.
[285:14.59]I know I can do this.
[285:16.15]Let's make this work, though.
[285:18.31]Encounters.
[285:21.14]Get rid of this.
[285:22.26]No, keep that.
[285:23.10]Forget about this one.
[285:26.72]I want the gnomish exchange.
[285:29.38]Get rid of this.
[285:31.32]The burning building can stay.
[285:33.00]This friendly innkeeper can stay.
[285:40.49]Some of these are really easy to go through.
[285:42.43]Lost Boy.
[285:45.65]Temple Prayers is like six bucks.
[285:47.59]No.
[285:48.75]The Old Maiden.
[285:49.35]I want the Old Maiden.
[285:52.85]She just gives you free shit.
[285:55.51]Friendly Innkeeper.
[285:59.53]This one's not terrible.
[286:00.59]I mean, I don't want to do his encounter.
[286:07.87]We'll do arm wrestling as well.
[286:11.07]Let's go with equipment here.
[286:12.51]Let's go with... I haven't even seen these.
[286:19.42]This is fine.
[286:21.58]A ring of food, maybe.
[286:22.58]Yeah, let's get a ring of food in there.
[286:29.13]And... Um...
[286:34.93]Let's get this in there too, just in case I come across it.
[286:38.41]Supplies.
[286:39.11]I'm going to remove this and go with some food.
[286:44.69]Because I just need it.
[286:46.41]Alright, we're going to win this one.
[286:48.80]It's time to win.
[286:50.36]After this attempt is the end of the stream.
[286:53.42]Let's beat this fucking encounter.
[286:59.46]Win or lose, the stream is going to end here.
[287:02.96]At the end of this run.
[287:07.92]The Hierophant.
[287:10.38]We know most of what happens here.
[287:13.10]The new assassin has been determined, and so the tale begins.
[287:18.32]Make sure they're all the same.
[287:22.72]Make sure, because it could be different.
[287:24.63]Work for a long time.
[287:25.53]Okay, they all spill the truth when they're drunk.
[287:28.69]I mean, he does.
[287:30.21]Rowena.
[287:31.63]Long time.
[287:32.25]She's the third legion of the Empire Army.
[287:36.13]She's very bribable.
[287:39.09]Galfrey's worked for a long time.
[287:40.89]Makes wild accusations when drunk.
[287:42.71]He wasn't drunk.
[287:46.96]Who are you?
[287:48.70]Retire.
[287:49.72]Let's get right to it.
[287:55.06]Arm wrestling.
[287:56.82]Yeah, yeah.
[287:57.88]Here comes the acrobat.
[288:00.58]He's set to roll.
[288:05.02]Easy money.
[288:07.86]I win.
[288:09.24]You gain two fame.
[288:10.36]Roland's no match for your strength.
[288:12.36]He cartwheels out the door.
[288:13.46]You get some gold.
[288:15.02]And then the next time you come back, it's time to try to win again.
[288:19.04]General store.
[288:21.10]What do you got for equipment?
[288:23.26]Ring of food.
[288:27.76]Um... I really want a weapon, unfortunately.
[288:39.54]This will come in handy, though.
[288:43.76]I'm gonna get it.
[288:47.94]I was so food-starved last time.
[288:50.50]Alright.
[288:55.00]Let's just get one... No, I'm gonna keep some coins.
[288:57.89]Let's leave.
[289:01.71]Goblins attack.
[289:04.79]Here we go.
[289:09.14]Ring of food sucks.
[289:11.06]I mean, it kind of does, but... I could... You saw what happened last time.
[289:14.96]I lost like 40 or 50 HP because of food.
[289:18.90]And these goblins are going to steal money.
[289:29.47]Each one needs to die.
[289:30.87]Just focus on them.
[289:35.31]Who cares... The guy is... What does this guy have?
[289:40.42]This guy has an item.
[289:45.28]Get out of the way.
[289:49.04]It's two down.
[289:49.64]No, he's not dead.
[289:50.41]Now he is.
[289:51.59]12 seconds.
[289:51.93]Get out of the way, please.
[289:54.91]Where'd he go?
[289:57.21]Ay-yi-yi.
[290:02.83]He's gonna open up the portal, but I'm gonna kill him before then.
[290:04.87]Thank god.
[290:06.29]Alright, we're good.
[290:17.22]Maybe I shouldn't be bringing this guy.
[290:20.54]The magician seems to be more effective.
[290:22.82]This guy just kind of dies.
[290:24.14]Alright, let's do it.
[290:31.56]At least I don't take my sword.
[290:32.64]Yeah.
[290:33.40]Well, I would be left with two rusty daggers.
[290:44.01]Got some more fame.
[290:44.81]I got the soldier's sword back.
[290:50.15]And he took some food.
[290:52.85]How did he take gold?
[290:53.63]I gained gold.
[290:56.67]Okay, here we go.
[290:58.21]Discard this to gain two food.
[290:59.43]No.
[291:00.31]Do not discard that.
[291:04.19]Cardinal blade.
[291:05.81]Yes, please.
[291:08.67]Although... Yeah, give it to me.
[291:14.00]Give it to me.
[291:14.90]Ten food.
[291:15.72]Doesn't even matter.
[291:17.60]Game over.
[291:18.64]Back to the inn.
[291:20.80]Enter the inn.
[291:22.60]Now let's go... Let's try... Let's do this again.
[291:24.74]I know how to talk to Grindon.
[291:26.63]Oh, no.
[291:26.83]Let's go to Rowena.
[291:27.63]Let's do this first.
[291:30.95]We have to kidnap the child of Lady Fielding.
[291:37.66]There's the meeting point.
[291:38.46]It's gonna be at the very end.
[291:39.38]Oh, no, it's not.
[291:39.80]That's fine.
[291:45.88]Make our way.
[291:46.72]Speedrun.
[291:47.50]Here's the betting house.
[291:49.48]Uh... This is the... No.
[291:55.28]No.
[291:56.76]We gotta get... We're going right to the guild.
[292:00.69]No, burning building.
[292:01.57]You're shouting up ahead as you make your way down the cobbled street.
[292:05.35]You see lights flickering on the road.
[292:09.02]Let me get in there.
[292:10.36]Okay.
[292:11.48]Wait, hold on.
[292:16.50]As you push your way through the crowd, you see a woman frantically... He can do it too?
[292:20.06]Alright, let him go.
[292:22.10]Without a word, Colburn draws one of his mighty swords and enters the blazing building.
[292:27.88]Oh, it turns it into a wheel.
[292:29.10]And look at all these failures.
[292:30.32]There's only one success.
[292:31.94]And it's right here.
[292:32.52]And I didn't get it.
[292:37.57]I'm still having trouble with this one.
[292:40.87]Well, you lose... I lost Colburn for three turns.
[292:45.19]You think you can make out some shapes coming from the smoke.
[292:47.13]Did Colburn manage to save them all?
[292:50.19]I don't... I don't know.
[292:51.67]Did he?
[293:00.82]Two figures fall out into the open air, coughing and sputtering.
[293:03.76]The villagers rush in and aid the family.
[293:06.64]While he was unable to save everyone, the villagers are grateful for your valiant effort.
[293:10.06]He didn't get it.
[293:14.06]God damn it.
[293:20.63]The market bazaar is a hive.
[293:22.03]Yeah.
[293:22.57]Push through the crowd and get... Yeah, he stole five gold.
[293:25.69]I need to get this.
[293:26.53]Pay attention, everybody.
[293:27.53]Everyone pay attention now.
[293:31.31]I think it's two.
[293:46.16]Four?
[293:48.78]I was gonna say two or three.
[293:53.60]Shit, I wasn't paying attention.
[293:59.05]Is it not random?
[293:59.89]That's what I thought, but apparently you can watch them.
[294:05.33]I'm feeling a two.
[294:13.53]I'm never gonna get this.
[294:17.28]I'm never gonna get that fucking thing.
[294:18.74]Alright, here we go.
[294:23.48]The carriage is protected by a contingent of guards to defeat all enemies before the timer to impress Rowena.
[294:31.14]Heavy weapons are recommended against Empire.
[294:32.70]You can exchange it.
[294:33.76]It doesn't matter.
[294:34.22]I don't have anything else.
[294:35.16]So I have to do this in time to impress this girl.
[294:40.06]It's completely random.
[294:40.92]Watching doesn't do anything.
[294:42.88]Well, there's like a big debate in chat right now whether or not that's the case.
[294:48.23]I thought it was random and it didn't matter.
[294:51.25]Alright, we need to impress this person.
[295:05.20]I like that.
[295:05.64]It really keeps everybody at bay.
[295:14.71]Nope.
[295:16.73]Make it snappy, come on.
[295:24.21]Tell me everything you know about how you're gonna kill the king.
[295:29.58]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[295:33.17]She's dead.
[295:33.59]Alright, well, I can't impress Rowana because she died.
[295:36.47]She just got her head cut off.
[295:43.67]Did I lose?
[295:44.19]Okay, no, she's impressed.
[295:52.20]She trusts you a little more.
[295:54.26]You open the carriage door to see a woman dressed in silks and gems clutching her son.
[295:58.10]Please!
[295:59.36]Take this gold!
[296:00.16]He's just a child!
[296:02.50]Without a second thought, Rowena pockets the heavy pouch of coins from the weeping mother and closes the door on them.
[296:09.77]She stares at you coldly.
[296:11.67]It's foolish to be loyal to anything but gold.
[296:14.05]I trust you agree.
[296:16.35]Swear yourself to secrecy.
[296:18.27]Because she's all about money.
[296:22.33]If there's nothing else, I have business elsewhere.
[296:24.25]Okay, this is... Ask about her favorite food.
[296:28.44]Roasted apple.
[296:31.04]Ask about her family.
[296:32.75]I have family in the capital.
[296:34.01]I do not talk to them.
[296:37.23]Ask about her past.
[296:39.25]I joined the guild after I murdered the captain of the Third Legion.
[296:43.31]Rowena said that she was in the Third Legion of the Empire and killed her captain.
[296:49.35]Okay, so she's already a murderer.
[296:51.03]What do you think of the father?
[296:53.19]He sits in his finery counting coins.
[296:55.41]I expect he will do so until the day he dies.
[296:58.83]She considers you for a bit.
[297:00.57]I wouldn't trust him so much.
[297:02.41]He's in a guild of thieves just like us after all.
[297:06.95]So that's true.
[297:11.90]So she did kill somebody.
[297:20.67]Let's go to the inn.
[297:22.79]Okay.
[297:25.97]I hope the job with Verwana was fruitful today.
[297:27.55]You are not dead with a knife in your back, so I presume yes.
[297:31.64]Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[297:34.52]So, let's do this one, this guy again, and not fuck it up.
[297:43.10]Warden is going to pick up some lamps from the port, right?
[297:45.95]So, what did we screw up this time here?
[297:49.79]What was the actual screw up?
[297:50.99]I don't, I don't, I'm not sure.
[297:55.65]I would assume this guy, it's either her, this guy or the girl.
[298:01.68]So let's go get more goblins.
[298:07.38]Defeat the goblins before they blow their horn and hopefully nobody steals anything.
[298:17.44]The gates are open, man.
[298:19.54]Flee!
[298:24.01]Yeah, somebody has my weapon.
[298:25.67]Who has it?
[298:25.99]The guy in the middle.
[298:27.79]You know... Can you run at them, please?
[298:30.06]Make a distraction for me.
[298:34.44]I need that weapon back.
[298:35.24]Like, I need that weapon back.
[298:36.68]For the love of God.
[298:41.76]If I lose anything else, I don't care.
[298:42.92]But, like, being able to do no damage is awful.
[298:49.25]This is the worst.
[298:50.05]This is the fucking worst.
[298:52.89]Oh my god, this is the worst!
[298:55.14]Please!
[298:55.58]I can't even kill a stupid fucking goblin!
[299:01.96]Whatever.
[299:02.28]They're gonna get away.
[299:11.51]Don't let him in the tunnel!
[299:13.57]Don't let him in the tunnel!
[299:19.92]Oh, I hate these fucking goblins.
[299:21.92]I hate this card.
[299:23.02]It's the worst.
[299:25.30]This is just fucking... The guys throwing the bombs, the goblins running around the circle.
[299:31.09]I'm gonna lose because I'm just fucking angry.
[299:42.57]I can't hurt anybody!
[299:44.17]Like, this is stupid!
[299:49.17]Oh, my fucking rage is gonna make me lose this whole game.
[299:55.82]Oh my god, my sheer fucking rage was gonna make me just lose.
[300:01.23]Jesus Christ.
[300:05.23]Walking around doing seven damage a swing to people.
[300:09.78]Fuck me in the face.
[300:18.71]I need food.
[300:20.05]I have to discard this.
[300:26.29]I need to drink this.
[300:30.33]Easy, easy!
[300:32.07]Oh my god, I was gonna have a literal aneurysm.
[300:40.84]Still doesn't realize the double daggers do the same damage because they hit twice.
[300:46.43]Yeah, but still, it takes double the animation time.
[300:48.69]It's like 1-2 instead of 1.
[300:50.21]It's double.
[300:50.71]It takes twice as much time.
[300:54.55]Oh, literal.
[300:55.43]Oh, shit.
[300:58.13]Alright, on the edge of the empire.
[300:59.64]I think I just need to go.
[301:00.56]I'm like hungry.
[301:03.00]I've failed this fucking mission like three times now.
[301:07.78]But like, go ask questions.
[301:11.22]The ask questions mission.
[301:15.59]Let's look at the giant Tetris block and see what the hell is going on.
[301:20.24]On the edge of the Empire, far from the capital, sits a lonely Tetris fucking watchtower block.
[301:24.26]You approach with caution, knowing that few travelers are allowed near it.
[301:29.74]Halt, calls one of the soldiers as you approach.
[301:31.48]None may cross the border from the northern lands into the Empire.
[301:34.02]Okay, I'm not going to... I don't have enough... There's no way this is going to happen.
[301:40.94]I only have three gold.
[301:41.98]I'm going to have to go the long way.
[301:45.11]You spend a few days finding another path far from the watchful eyes of the tower.
[301:51.94]Okay, I was about to say, did I lose because I walked around for two days?
[301:54.42]I was about to be really sad.
[302:01.32]Ay-yi-yi.
[302:05.22]Okay.
[302:06.96]So this guy, you have to tell him that Father Gaffrey's a great person, right?
[302:13.68]Smiles when he hears your answer.
[302:14.88]Yep.
[302:15.18]Borden trusts you.
[302:17.00]At the port, you are approached by a pirate bearing a load of... Oh, I have to stab myself, don't I?
[302:20.96]Unusual pale pirate shakes his head.
[302:24.80]No, he pulls out.
[302:25.52]I want his blood.
[302:26.86]Ay-yi-yi.
[302:27.98]Am I gonna die here?
[302:42.04]Borden trusts you.
[302:44.09]Alright, we're fine.
[302:44.83]Everything's gonna be fine.
[302:46.97]You retrieve the crates of stolen lamps and pile them onto the wagon.
[302:50.88]Okay.
[302:51.84]When you arrive at the drop-off point, I have to attempt to comfort him.
[302:57.82]Which is just... This is the metronome.
[302:59.87]This one's not hard.
[303:00.93]Just don't screw it up.
[303:09.39]Borden trusts you.
[303:11.16]So now he should tell me things that I want to know.
[303:14.02]Are there really 19 clues you can get?
[303:15.70]Uh, what's your favorite food?
[303:19.33]Blackberry tart or apple tart?
[303:21.45]Borden begins to sweat.
[303:22.43]So like the... Apples or blueberries?
[303:27.37]What about your family?
[303:29.11]Borden looks sadly to the ground.
[303:30.69]She left me for a traitor.
[303:32.41]You don't want to probe any further.
[303:33.87]Borden said that his wife left him for a traitor.
[303:37.74]What about your past?
[303:39.32]I was a farmer before this.
[303:40.52]What do you think of the father?
[303:43.00]The boss always makes sure we get our cut.
[303:44.36]You can ask her any better, really, in a guild.
[303:47.11]That's it?
[303:49.51]That's all this guy's gonna give me?
[303:53.65]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[303:55.39]I can't even walk to the left.
[303:59.49]This is it.
[304:00.61]It's over.
[304:05.97]I need to sell, like, everything.
[304:11.52]I need to literally sell all my shit.
[304:14.76]I have to sell the food.
[304:15.58]I have to sell the sword.
[304:16.49]I might even have to sell the blade.
[304:21.35]Goddamn.
[304:22.91]How much is the food?
[304:23.75]Three food.
[304:25.11]I can get four food here for 15 to 21.
[304:26.63]Alright.
[304:26.85]Well...
[304:45.14]Let's do this.
[304:48.46]No, wait a minute.
[304:57.19]Oh, six.
[305:03.15]Should I sell the food ring?
[305:07.67]I'm gonna end up with a rusty ass sword.
[305:09.77]No, we're gonna have to try to do this with three food.
[305:17.12]Can we?
[305:17.44]Let's see.
[305:17.96]That's one, two, three.
[305:20.74]I'll be able to land on the next card.
[305:26.04]Eat the ring.
[305:28.18]Just, like, stuff it down your throat.
[305:33.78]I think I have... I think I'll be okay.
[305:41.01]Let's break camp.
[305:41.95]That's always...
[305:44.89]Yeah, that's all I can do.
[305:45.81]I just have to go down.
[305:46.71]Let me just make sure I have my stuff on.
[305:49.61]I want... Get these out of here.
[305:54.39]Soldier's sword.
[305:55.11]At least still have that.
[305:57.15]I have this, and I have the food ring.
[305:59.09]Okay.
[306:00.99]Let's go.
[306:03.86]So, where is the way out?
[306:06.06]I really don't want to do any more than I have to here.
[306:08.76]Friendly innkeeper.
[306:12.80]By healing...
[306:15.26]Draw a life gain card for 10 gold.
[306:18.74]I don't have enough.
[306:19.32]I can't ask about lodging.
[306:21.30]Rest.
[306:21.68]One food heals five health.
[306:24.16]Even though, no.
[306:25.10]That's not what I'm going to do.
[306:27.52]How is the cheese festival?
[306:31.00]Oh, well, there we go.
[306:35.52]We just have to keep moving.
[306:39.50]Regardless of the outcome here, we need to enter the inn.
[306:45.35]Uh, this is where he says, tomorrow I die.
[306:49.77]So, go on the, I know how to do the whole job with, with Grendan.
[306:57.98]This is, this is like such a, just a speed run.
[307:01.54]We've done this like three times now.
[307:03.06]Alright, thank, it's right there.
[307:08.18]Please, give me an encounter that gives me food.
[307:12.01]Ugh.
[307:17.39]Hate this fucking card.
[307:21.49]Oh No, this is where it ends I Look at how many people are here at four five six seven eight nine people Nine
[307:45.29]Look at how many people are here!
[307:46.75]Oh my lord!
[307:51.33]It doesn't even matter if they escape or not, honestly.
[307:53.83]That guy just has my soldier's sword.
[307:58.90]I just need to get that back.
[308:02.98]Nothing else matters.
[308:03.80]Fighting an entire camp of people.
[308:16.79]At least I got my sword.
[308:21.37]Stun these guys.
[308:26.15]Can I please kill him?
[308:33.51]That guy just like told me to fuck myself.
[308:36.61]That guy did the fuck you.
[308:38.17]Yeah, that's what they're doing.
[308:41.25]That's actually kind of funny.
[308:43.57]They jump in the teleporter and they just give you like the finger.
[308:54.87]Kill, kill, kill.
[309:04.63]Get rid of you.
[309:07.28]That's not fair.
[309:08.68]That's not fair.
[309:09.78]He didn't... He fucking just sniped me in midair and blew...
[309:29.94]My companion's dead again.
[309:37.17]Oh, fucking lord.
[309:39.73]Look, I just want to find out who the murderer is.
[309:41.75]Why do you have to throw, like, fucking ten enemies at me with the goblin?
[309:45.25]Oh, my lord.
[310:02.44]I gotta bring him back.
[310:03.70]Go for it.
[310:10.30]Come here, you.
[310:12.18]Okay.
[310:13.04]This should be a little bit better now.
[310:17.46]He's dead.
[310:19.34]Oh my god!
[310:20.18]Damn it!
[310:21.14]Jesus Christ!
[310:29.50]Why?
[310:30.02]Alright, well that's it.
[310:55.62]I'm not sure if this mission sucks or if I'm terrible.
[310:59.26]I don't know.
[311:02.94]I did all of these without a problem at all.
[311:05.54]And then all of a sudden, this is not possible for me to complete.
[311:10.81]Whatever.
[311:13.59]Maybe I'm just doing them in the wrong order.
[311:15.03]Sigh.
[311:42.04]You aren't valid.
[311:42.94]Goblins are basic.
[311:44.20]Yeah, the goblins are fucking dumb.
[311:47.69]I think the goblins take way too many hits.
[311:51.89]Especially considering every time you go into a goblin fight, they take your weapon.
[312:00.27]It's like, fight these goblins.
[312:01.35]Oh, by the way, you don't have a weapon now.
[312:03.03]And it takes like fucking 16, 20 hits to kill a goblin.
[312:13.55]Alright, that's it.
[312:15.78]I'm done.
[312:18.36]I'm going to get some rest.
[312:22.98]On Thursday, we're going to turn on Twitch integration.
[312:29.33]And tomorrow is the PC build stream.
[312:33.79]We're going to come back to this game on Thursday.
[312:39.37]Thank you for watching.
[312:40.75]Much appreciated, everybody.
[312:45.33]This game is fantastic.
[312:48.73]Except the goblins are fucking stupid.
[312:53.11]Game is a 10 out of 10 experience.
[312:56.01]The goblins make it a 4.
[313:01.14]I'm just kidding.
[313:01.72]That's a joke.
[313:04.11]It's supposed to be hard.
[313:05.19]It's supposed to be annoying.
[313:06.21]That's like the whole purpose of the game.
[313:10.85]That's the entire point of Hand of Fate is it's supposed to just be obnoxious.
[313:14.89]That's like... That's what it is.
[313:18.99]Good night, everybody.
[313:20.01]I'll see you tomorrow.
[313:21.07]Probably... Probably like... It's probably going to happen after 6 or 7.
[313:28.25]Because it's not scheduled tomorrow.
[313:30.01]But...
[313:33.08]I hope you enjoy it.
[313:34.04]We're going to have some fun tomorrow.
[313:37.70]Make sure I didn't miss any bits here.

[314:32.64]See you tomorrow.
[314:35.14]Am I saying his name wrong?
[314:37.30]Is it Buru?
[314:38.02]I think it's Buru.
[314:42.49]Buru.
[314:43.63]Buru, no.
[314:45.03]I'm going to look it up on Google.
[314:46.35]How do you say Buru?
[314:53.19]Buru, okay, yeah.
[314:54.21]Well, thank you regardless.
[314:57.18]Good night, everybody.
