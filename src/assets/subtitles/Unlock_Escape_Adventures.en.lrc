[00:00.81]Alright, that was fucking weird.
[00:04.58]So apparently, I don't know why this is, but I guess most of Twitch's servers are down?
[00:16.82]So let me explain why this is possible.
[00:19.65]I usually stream to a server in Arizona, right?
[00:26.01]So I picked the Arizona server.
[00:27.67]That's the one I usually stream to because Etalyx and I run from the same box.
[00:35.81]We both decided we shouldn't probably run to the same server.
[00:40.41]So I was just like scrolling through picking new servers.
[00:46.73]Which one of these is going to work?
[00:48.53]And then you guys saying this stream was fine.
[00:50.25]So I'm like, well, let's just go to the same one.
[00:53.74]So we're both going to the same server and there's no problems at all.
[00:56.68]So I was freaking out.
[00:58.16]I thought there was a major problem with like my computer or something.
[01:01.30]No, it's just the Twitch servers are all fucked up.
[01:07.58]I guess that's just what's going on.
[01:10.26]So, welcome.
[01:12.24]Sorry for that.
[01:12.92]I wish I was live 15, 20 minutes ago.
[01:19.35]Anyways, I need a coaster.
[01:22.57]Get that down here.
[01:24.33]I feel like I should retweet again.
[01:26.13]But it's alright.
[01:31.94]Let's just get started here.
[01:33.42]There we go.
[01:38.68]What is happening on stream today?
[01:40.00]Well, give me a second to explain it.
[01:43.44]I just turned it on.
[01:44.14]I just was able to be live for a minute.
[01:46.30]Just making sure it's gonna work.
[01:51.58]Now, now, now, now, now, now!
[01:54.56]Alright, everybody relax.
[01:55.62]I just- I just, like, dodged a major, like, computer bullet, okay?
[02:00.91]And this is what we got here, okay?
[02:03.27]Hi, by the way.
[02:04.95]I'm a little flustered.
[02:06.19]I'm a little, like, fucking angry.
[02:08.27]I just- I can't help that.
[02:10.37]I gotta come down off of, like, being upset.
[02:12.76]Because I was just really upset.
[02:15.40]I was just very, very irritated.
[02:17.74]But not anymore.
[02:20.54]I think we're- I'm just making sure this is good.
[02:25.30]Nice table.
[02:26.00]Well, this is a fuck you table.
[02:28.16]You don't know what a fuck you table is.
[02:30.06]It's a table that you just do whatever you want on it.
[02:32.38]You don't really care.
[02:34.74]You paint on it.
[02:35.52]You play card games on it.
[02:37.96]You, like, pick it up over your head and throw it down a flight of stairs just because you felt like it.
[02:44.51]I got here three decks.
[02:46.11]This is the thing I was talking about, like, last week.
[02:48.03]You're probably like, why do you got a fucking iPad here?
[02:51.41]First of all, I know people are going to talk about it, so let's just show it.
[02:54.70]Yes, this is broken.
[02:55.72]I don't know if you can see this.
[02:59.56]All down there is a big crack down the middle.
[03:02.82]I stepped on this out of bed one day.
[03:08.32]And now there's a big giant slice down the middle and it's cracked and the volume doesn't work anymore.
[03:15.17]I was lying in bed sleeping.
[03:16.67]Sometimes what I do, I don't know why I do this, I'm just a fucking idiot.
[03:20.19]And I have an end table that's to my left.
[03:24.44]So instead of just like putting it on the end table when I'm tired, I like, I just like, I'm falling asleep and just go like, and just like hang it over the edge and let go.
[03:37.46]I don't know why I don't, I'm just fucking crazy.
[03:39.98]I just get so tired that I just like hang it over the edge and just, and then fall asleep.
[03:46.10]So I forgot that I did that and I got out of bed one day and I just put the heel down like right in the middle and then stepped again.
[03:53.48]and uh that no no no no don't don't no no no I'm not ready I'm not ready yet I'm not ready yet don't press this button I gotta like god be so fucking mad right I'm so mad right now I was like about to like fucking elbow through the screen I was gonna like WWE off the top rope like through the middle of my screen I was so fucking angry I I gotta I gotta like how do I how do you what's it give me like an exercise can I do something
[04:18.73]How do I, like, make this right?
[04:20.05]How do I, like, change this attitude?
[04:22.51]I've got such a fucking bad attitude right now.
[04:29.52]Give me a minute.
[04:37.05]I've got such a bad attitude right now.
[04:38.89]I can hear it.
[04:40.31]I sound different.
[04:41.21]I sound like an attitude boy.
[04:44.69]It's not like, let it go over the bed, like, whatever.
[04:48.74]I can feel it.
[04:50.66]But... Should I tweet again?
[04:52.80]Everybody like... Are we good?
[04:56.84]Or should I like tweet again?
[05:00.30]No.
[05:00.52]I think I'm alright.
[05:01.85]Anywho.
[05:03.15]I don't know which one of these I want to play.
[05:05.43]This game... There's like 20 of them, right?
[05:08.37]So I got these three.
[05:12.47]Maybe you guys could pick which one we want to do.
[05:14.49]I don't know.
[05:15.57]I was going to just like...
[05:17.91]randomize and like let my finger stop on one of them we've got the clown world like clown in the town we've got wild west world we've got dinosaur world so I don't know which one of these three we want to do let us click well I think people want to do clown from my from what it was before my understanding
[05:46.44]Squeakin' Sausage Day.
[05:47.44]Now, I have no idea how this is played.
[05:48.90]This might be the worst spring we've ever been to.
[05:51.04]Or it might be the best spring we've ever been to.
[05:54.10]It's one of those, like, flip the coin, which one of these is it going to be?
[05:59.14]But each one of these has a deck, which I very specifically was yelled at.
[06:04.50]Because look at this, ready?
[06:05.28]You open the box.
[06:06.09]Look at this.
[06:06.37]This is cool.
[06:07.75]Unlock.
[06:08.91]Important.
[06:10.07]Do not look through the card decks.
[06:12.80]It's like, don't fucking touch this.
[06:14.82]So I'm like, okay.
[06:16.16]So I haven't even opened them.
[06:17.12]They're just here.
[06:17.60]It says, just don't touch it.
[06:20.88]So I want people to know that I didn't fuck with this.
[06:24.90]Sealed.
[06:26.38]Inside of the shrink.
[06:27.69]I haven't done anything to that.
[06:28.79]I want to make sure you understand that.
[06:29.75]I'm not trying to cheat here.
[06:32.25]The goal of these decks is it is an escape game, which pairs itself with this.
[06:40.68]You pick one from here, and then you've got to escape the game.
[06:44.56]I don't know how the fuck... Yeah, I've got my fingerprints on it now.
[06:48.46]Alright.
[06:49.54]So you understand how it works.
[06:51.36]Well, I mean, as much as I do.
[06:52.61]There's fingerprints all over this.
[06:54.49]Yeah, I mean... Yeah, if you want to dust this, you're going to find all kinds of fucking fingerprints on this.
[07:00.61]You'll find footprints on this, too.
[07:03.54]You'll find nose prints.
[07:04.69]You know when a dog, when there's a sliding door at somebody's house, and at the bottom of the glass where the sliding door is, there's dog nose prints literally all over it?
[07:14.13]That's definitely on here.
[07:15.55]I've gotten close before, and my nose is streaked down the middle.
[07:19.03]So my nose print's on here.
[07:21.35]Alright, let's just do the clown one.
[07:23.08]That one sounds like the most fun.
[07:25.44]I think that's the one I want to do.
[07:29.97]And look, these are supposed to take... You have your time to do these.
[07:33.13]You have 60 minutes to complete them.
[07:36.43]And I'm going to try just to do one.
[07:40.97]So how do I... Let's see.
[07:47.09]Unlock.
[07:47.57]Ages 10 and up.
[07:50.17]60 minutes.
[07:51.21]One to six players.
[07:55.31]So if I had six... Okay, I might go over a little bit of time here.
[08:01.26]because if it's 60 minutes and you're gonna have six people working together, I mean, I'm gonna take the whole 60 minutes, right?
[08:07.88]It's gonna take me like a long time.
[08:10.19]Alright, hold on.
[08:12.45]Important, do not look through the card decks before starting to play.
[08:15.57]There's a 10 card tutorial deck and then a 60 card deck.
[08:21.13]Each deck is a full independent scenario.
[08:24.55]Enter an immersive adventure and work together to complete your mission.
[08:28.36]You have one hour in real time
[08:31.04]to overcome the many challenges.
[08:36.25]I gotta go like smell like a rose.
[08:38.59]I'm gonna go get a flower, I'll be right back.
[09:13.14]I was about to leave.
[09:13.80]Never mind.
[09:14.48]I'm still here.
[09:15.72]No, get this off.
[09:16.34]I'm just... God, I gotta fucking get this out of me.
[09:20.59]I'm gonna scream, okay?
[09:21.85]I think that'll work.
[09:25.39]I need to, like, scream.
[09:26.91]Like, I'm gonna scream.
[09:42.88]I feel a little bit better.
[09:45.79]Alright.
[09:47.07]I think I'm good.
[09:48.37]Did that work?
[09:51.67]There's like a devil just sitting right here.
[09:53.53]There's no angel here.
[09:54.35]There's two devils.
[09:55.89]And they're both just like fucking throwing darts into my neck.
[09:59.35]Just like... I should really go get like a drink.
[10:04.64]But it's like fucking four o'clock in the afternoon.
[10:07.78]Oh, I gotta just like relax.
[10:10.10]I gotta beat the clown game, okay?
[10:13.70]It's over, I'm live, everything's fine, everything's fixed.

[10:19.98]Okay, so, I'm like fucking happy Gilmore, Ray, I swear to God.
[10:24.86]Alright, welcome to Unlock.
[10:28.68]I don't think I need this anymore, do I?
[10:32.98]Maybe I should put that up here.
[10:37.08]Feels nice.
[10:41.97]Get a better table.
[10:43.74]Don't, don't push me right now.
[10:45.74]I'm already fucking flustered.
[10:46.92]Don't push me.
[10:49.72]Okay, so you guys are not going to be able to read these that well.
[10:53.95]So, I just like looked at the fuck, I just saw all the answers I think.
[10:56.91]The fact, this is like a teacher's guide.
[11:03.23]This is like a teacher's guide.
[11:06.59]No, I did not.
[11:07.55]I didn't, right?
[11:11.46]That's not what's on the back.
[11:12.76]Why did it not say don't look at the back?
[11:16.14]Oh, do I look at that either?
[11:17.12]Okay.
[11:19.89]I didn't see anything, I swear to God.
[11:21.27]How do I get this open without seeing the answers?
[11:27.75]I swear to God there is like a full on cheat sheet back here.
[11:38.77]Am I supposed to open the deck?
[11:41.08]I am, right?

[11:54.99]Tutorial.
[11:55.47]Welcome to Unlocky will find all the sensations of an escape room game in this game.
[12:02.75]You'll be confronted with puzzles, codes to decipher, objects to put together, and tricks to discover.
[12:10.45]For this first adventure, you are at an interview in the unlocked secret society on the top floor of an office building.
[12:18.44]The manager who welcomes you smirks and leaves you in a seemingly trivial room, locking the door behind him.
[12:26.04]Oh, a secret society.
[12:27.52]Alright, here we go.
[12:34.76]Alright, I'm ready.
[12:37.14]I gotta get excited for this shit.
[12:42.42]This is like in ten point font by the way.
[12:44.88]Hopefully they're not all like this.
[12:46.42]Alright.
[12:47.66]Launch the app.
[12:48.52]Select the scenario tutorial.
[12:52.49]Okay.
[12:54.71]There's like all kinds of weird shit on here.
[13:00.61]And then press start.
[13:04.90]You now have ten minutes to get out of your first unlock adventure.
[13:09.04]Are you stuck?
[13:10.39]You may ask for hints in the application by entering the card number.
[13:17.67]Okay, I gotta go.
[13:18.53]Ten minutes remaining.
[13:20.33]Turn over this card.
[13:27.90]This is the office.
[13:30.86]Here is the room where you are locked in.
[13:32.52]Several elements are visible.
[13:33.82]You may now search and reveal the five cards whose number you can see.
[13:41.37]Okay, search and reveal the five cards whose numbers you can see.
[13:45.09]You guys get a good look at that?
[13:47.45]Make sure you can see that.
[13:50.63]Okay.
[13:53.19]Okay, honestly, like I will tell you what's happening because I got 10 minutes.
[13:56.22]Okay, what is it?
[13:57.30]20, what card?
[13:59.16]Search and reveal the five cards whose number you can see.
[14:03.76]I need 11, 21.
[14:06.36]There's a fucking million of these.
[14:07.78]Alright, 21.
[14:11.19]21, it's gonna take me 10 minutes to find these.
[14:13.70]67.
[14:17.62]Okay, I gotta put this out in a good area here, because this 21's down here, 67's up here.
[14:21.30]Do I have anything else in there that I need?
[14:25.56]I don't think so.
[14:26.86]Okay, wait, nothing else in there?
[14:28.18]Okay, 21, 67's a room up here.
[14:30.42]35.
[14:30.44]35. 42.
[14:44.42]Okay, 8 minutes and 33 seconds.
[14:46.12]Okay, 42 and then, hold on, let's get this in a better spot.
[14:49.64]And 11.
[14:52.10]Alright.
[14:54.45]Here's the room where you're locked in.
[14:55.73]Several elements are visible.
[14:56.65]Okay, I can see a trash can, a desk, a window, a switch.
[15:02.23]Alright.
[15:03.27]You may now search and reveal the cards.
[15:05.41]What's over here?
[15:06.68]We've got a key.
[15:10.34]We've got an exit door.
[15:14.84]We've got a grid with five centimeter apart pins.
[15:21.35]Okay.
[15:23.89]We got a locked cabinet.
[15:27.71]And we also have a TV screen.
[15:30.17]Can you guys see this shit?
[15:30.95]Do I have to like turn the brightness up on the sun?
[15:35.78]Okay, so we got, this is the office here.
[15:39.34]Key.
[15:42.32]No.
[15:45.35]I'll play like this.
[15:50.16]You can combine this object with a red object or the red number of a machine.
[15:57.94]To do so, add their numbers together.
[15:59.68]If the total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card.
[16:04.09]So I can combine this with a red object or a red number.
[16:05.99]I can do key and TV.
[16:10.83]Okay, so should I open the TV with the key?
[16:13.82]Keys don't have TVs.
[16:18.04]Add their numbers together.
[16:21.74]To do so, add their numbers together.
[16:23.18]If the total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card.
[16:28.75]53.
[16:31.31]No, I cannot use the key on the TV, guys.
[16:34.93]A locked cabinet.
[16:35.63]You can combine this object, but you can't.
[16:38.65]Key on cabinet, which means 48.
[16:42.58]5, 46.
[16:42.90]So 46, we're gonna do key on, yeah, there it is, 46, we can open that cabinet with this key.
[16:49.73]So then, here we go, ready?
[17:00.35]Oh, sick, very good, the cabinet is open!
[17:03.59]Discard cards 11 and 35.
[17:08.09]Look closely at the picture.
[17:09.23]There are two interesting elements.
[17:10.89]If you see a number, reveal the card.
[17:20.27]We opened the cabinet.
[17:24.43]16.
[17:27.63]I see it, okay.
[17:30.79]Boom.
[17:33.97]I gotta like turn the sun up.
[17:35.78]I'm turning up the sun.
[17:40.64]And give me something like music, too.
[17:44.14]No, that's for the dinosaur one.
[17:45.20]What's the clown one, right?
[17:50.31]Let me turn up the sun.
[17:55.73]There we go.
[17:56.91]Okay, now you guys can see what's going on here.
[18:00.42]Now you can see what's going on.
[18:03.54]Maybe a little too bright.
[18:09.61]That's better.
[18:10.87]Alright, here we go.
[18:13.31]So this is a, uh... What is this?
[18:17.15]Did I actually make it worse?
[18:21.53]Electrical wire, you can find that... Okay, combine this with a red number or... I'm running out of time here.
[18:29.62]Now it's too bright.
[18:31.36]So I got a red wire.
[18:32.28]I can add it to a machine.
[18:33.26]If I have red wire on TV...
[18:43.46]I think that might be better.
[18:45.35]Alright, red wire on TV.
[18:47.61]That's what I'm gonna say.
[18:49.39]So that's 16 plus 42 is 52, 58.
[18:54.17]No, no wire on TV.
[18:59.84]Red wire on this weird grid over here, possibly.
[19:06.60]This is a machine.
[19:09.14]Your goal is to obtain a single red number.
[19:18.92]Then add that number to the blue object and modifier.
[19:23.60]Single red number.
[19:26.60]I don't have a single red number.
[19:30.20]Are you telling me I can't use that on here?
[19:33.36]What about the exit?
[19:36.98]There's a four-digit, alright.
[19:39.12]I see a skull right now.
[19:44.78]What am I supposed to do with this wire?
[19:51.83]It ends in rings.
[19:53.05]No, I definitely have to put it on here.
[19:56.27]That's definitely where that red wire goes.
[20:01.52]Obtain a sum of one or more black numbers.
[20:04.82]I don't even know what the fuck that's even talking about.
[20:14.10]I can't just use that on here?
[20:17.54]I can use this on a machine, but there's no cards in here for that.
[20:25.83]crawl under the door TV is a red number yeah that's so I could but that there's no card here that that could make any sense you add these two numbers together 16 and 42 that there's no number in here that matches that should I just flip these cards over and see what they are
[21:00.73]I have two minutes left.
[21:02.43]It's definitely this and this.
[21:04.33]Why would it not be?
[21:05.09]It's a single red number.
[21:19.54]I discard these.
[21:24.76]Should I just get a hint?
[21:27.55]Take the 16, add two of the numbers on the 67 card.
[21:38.84]10 and up, man.
[21:41.46]I'm not old enough to play this, I don't think.
[21:49.02]So I have to combine, like, two black numbers together?
[21:51.57]Not these.
[21:58.88]I don't even have a hint.
[22:01.64]Oh, uh, 16.
[22:03.38]No, I want a hint.
[22:05.40]Card number 16.
[22:09.35]Could be inserted into the machine.
[22:11.97]That's what I'm saying.
[22:12.83]So why, what, I just did that.
[22:16.45]So what the hell's going on here?
[22:21.79]If the total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card.
[22:24.41]It doesn't.
[22:28.36]Two black numbers plus 16.
[22:34.82]Didn't I discard these?
[22:39.03]Discard cards 11 and 35.
[22:40.81]So I discard these.
[22:45.23]How do I combine two black cards?
[22:49.66]If there's only one available here.
[22:57.48]Use the app.
[23:01.40]Machine, what, wait, what?
[23:06.56]Hold on, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:08.05]This is the machine?
[23:08.85]I'm dead.
[23:26.28]Combine this with a red object or the red number of a machine.
[23:46.27]I have to add two num... Oh, I thought they were talking about, like, cards!
[23:56.22]Single red number, sum of one or more of the black numbers.
[23:59.76]Okay, so I thought they were talking about, like, this shit up here.
[24:02.94]That's alright, we've only been dead for 48 seconds.
[24:08.63]We can come back.
[24:11.01]Okay, so...
[24:15.46]So we need a single red number from four +2?
[24:25.74]So then add that, okay, so what about six plus 16?
[24:30.50]So we gotta get two of these and then it's gonna correspond to a card in here.
[24:33.50]Okay, so 25 minus 16.
[24:37.75]Alright, I fucking get it.
[24:40.73]Don't worry, everybody relax, it's okay.
[24:42.59]We're just figuring, this is the tutorial.
[24:48.74]So it's gonna be... 9, right?
[24:51.92]7.
[24:56.00]8, 9.
[24:57.82]Plus 16.
[24:58.14]Okay.
[24:59.98]I thought I had to, like, do something with this shit.
[25:01.98]Apparently not.
[25:04.42]What 9?
[25:06.73]Wrong.
[25:09.71]I'm gonna flip the table in a fucking second and I'm gonna play, like, fucking pee pants.
[25:16.01]I have to enter 67 into the app?
[25:19.37]No I don't.
[25:20.87]No I do not.
[25:24.99]Oh my fucking god damn it dude, are you serious?
[25:37.84]You lose one minute per error.
[25:39.70]It is best to first understand which are the right pins before using it.
[25:43.64]Okay, alright, everybody relax.
[25:46.36]I'm starting to understand here.
[25:48.61]When you have a machine card, you have to use the machine, the actual machine that you have in your hand, which is the iPad device.
[25:56.06]Should've went and got that rose.
[25:57.62]Okay.
[26:00.58]So, we need to have, it's 25 minus 16, and we've got this here.
[26:10.93]We need nine.
[26:13.63]So, you've got seven in the top left and two in the top right.
[26:18.74]And there you go.
[26:19.82]Thank you.
[26:20.46]Okay.
[26:21.40]I lost a minute.
[26:29.21]What?
[26:31.79]What are you talking about?
[26:32.65]25 minus 16 is 9.
[26:50.68]I don't understand what's going on.
[26:57.27]Can you help me?
[26:58.97]I don't fucking understand.
[27:00.05]A single red number.
[27:07.83]Some or more of the black numbers, right?
[27:11.17]Some of one or more, and then add that to this blue object, which is the wire.
[27:18.01]If the total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card.
[27:25.49]So... Why can't it just be... Does it have to be a certain... How is that... I don't understand.
[27:35.67]How is 7 and 2 not 9?
[27:36.75]Why is 6 plus 3 9 and 7 plus 2 not 9?
[27:48.93]So I did 7 and 2, and it said wrong.
[28:08.73]Cabinet.
[28:12.29]Look at the cabinet.
[28:16.03]I didn't know that was important information.
[28:17.85]I didn't know that.
[28:18.85]Alright, I'm gonna start to... 25, are you ready?
[28:32.57]Well done.
[28:34.65]You have restored the electricity by placing the wire on the machine.
[28:37.94]Discard 16, 46, and 67.
[28:38.28]16, discard.
[28:44.44]46, discard.
[28:45.58]I didn't know I still needed that!
[28:49.19]And where's 47?
[28:49.53]It's already discarded.
[28:52.39]67, I mean.
[28:56.83]Got it.
[28:57.37]Alright, the power is back on.
[29:00.96]Plus 6.
[29:03.18]Plus 6 is a modifier that you can add to a red object, or the red number of machine, okay.
[29:08.74]If the total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card.
[29:12.51]42 plus six.
[29:19.21]Well played, the screen lights up.
[29:21.91]Seven, two, three, nine.
[29:25.06]Well played, the screen is on.
[29:26.06]This should help you out to get out discards 25 and 42.
[29:28.56]There it goes.
[29:31.48]Hey, you can enter a code into the application thanks to these four digits.
[29:39.91]To get out and finish the tutorial, you must enter a four-digit code into the application.
[29:44.39]What's that?
[29:45.69]Code.
[29:46.07]72397239.
[29:46.09]No.
[29:46.89]What?
[29:47.11]No, these are the correct numbers, but they aren't in the right order.
[29:54.17]What?
[29:54.37]Oh, this is...
[30:04.43]Red.
[30:05.46]Red, yellow, blue, green.
[30:08.58]I gotta pay attention to these cards.
[30:10.68]It's color-coded.
[30:11.50]9-3.
[30:13.42]9-3.
[30:13.46]9-3.
[30:14.46]7-2.
[30:15.82]Alright.
[30:22.15]Alright, boys and girls.
[30:24.79]I did it.
[30:27.29]I understand it now.
[30:28.17]I get it.
[30:28.69]I get it.
[30:30.81]Check your score.
[30:31.90]Your time in the penalty is in court.

[31:15.54]The sun's like going up in a random... I'm gonna zoom the fuck in.
[31:18.92]I got an idea.
[31:29.68]You guys can probably read that a little bit better.
[31:31.36]I mean, not really.
[31:38.54]That's better, right?
[31:40.44]Enhanced?
[31:41.84]Now I got this right here for you to check that out.
[31:45.47]Yeah, there's no way anybody's going to read this.
[31:47.51]So what I'm going to have to do is I'm going to have to go like this.
[31:52.71]But even still, you can't read that.
[31:54.67]Nobody can.
[31:56.39]Just trust me, I'm going to read it to you, and you'll get the gist of it from there.
[32:01.57]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[32:04.81]Are you guys ready?
[32:06.13]This is called Squeak and Sausage.

[32:47.95]But you have courageously slipped into his headquarters to prevent it.
[32:52.58]While you wander in the corridors of this old shack, a trap door opens beneath your feet and you fall into a dark and damp dungeon.
[33:02.12]Your screams will not help you.
[33:04.47]You are prisoners of the professor.
[33:06.75]The world is lost forever.
[33:08.81]Unless you can get out of here and sabotage the plans of Nocide, you are our last hope.

[34:13.06]Turn over this card.
[34:21.66]You are plunged into darkness.

[37:49.07]I'm not even playing an escape game.
[37:55.31]Where is J?
[37:56.35]This is not even in this deck?
[38:06.14]Am I fucking crazy?

[39:23.75]I just got a hidden object!
[39:26.99]Wait, I just pressed the X!
[39:28.75]How do I get back to that?
[39:39.55]One.
[39:39.77]Okay, good.
[39:42.66]Whoa, alright.
[39:45.18]We can see now.
[39:47.44]Get a good look.
[39:50.98]Okay, storeroom.
[39:53.28]Hallelujah, the room that you were locked in from the start is a storeroom.
[39:58.52]Okay, we can look at all these other things.
[40:02.11]Finally, we can see.
[40:03.43]So we got a fridge, we got a TV, we've got a cabinet.
[40:07.89]What is M?
[40:09.53]What the hell is M?
[40:13.25]You guys take a, okay ready?
[40:14.29]Take a screenshot.
[40:15.61]And like, put it up on your screen.
[40:19.92]Like that, there you go.
[40:21.56]Okay, now you know where it is.
[40:23.52]I'm gonna say, there's a little pouch over here, let's go for M. What's this thing?
[40:28.78]M. I don't know how much more of this clown music I can take.
[40:32.75]I can't even hear it.
[40:35.85]I can very faintly hear the clown music.
[40:39.13]And it's like, probably annoying a lot of people.
[40:44.40]do I discard these now I feel like I need I discard this m can I just like spread these out on the ground I'm gonna put these on the ground alright m let's see what m is
[41:15.69]What the hell does this mean?
[41:20.18]I'm peering in, it's like a... 25?
[41:21.64]25, 79, and then plus one.
[41:28.58]They're all pluses.
[41:31.15]Strange.
[41:31.37]Okay.
[41:45.07]So now, I mean, I don't know what that means.
[41:47.79]91?
[41:47.89]Let's check out 91.
[41:53.06]It's 90.
[41:59.06]So I have to add those together somehow.
[42:04.42]I want to, like, make my own one of these.
[42:09.24]And have some of them, like, have, like... Never mind. 91.
[42:19.45]I'm putting him on the ground.
[42:21.81]Did I already go buy it?
[42:23.37]No, of course it's the last one that I got here.
[42:25.47]Alright, 91 is this cabinet over here.
[42:27.97]Let's see where it is.
[42:28.57]I'm gonna get this in the right spot.
[42:31.62]Let's move these out of the way.
[42:34.04]So 91 is like a radio.
[42:37.02]A dilapidated old VCR.
[42:40.98]So that's here, that's what's over the cabinet.
[42:46.33]You're playing an escape room by yourself.
[42:47.81]Yeah, I got locked down here by myself.
[42:49.37]I, like, fell down some weird hole.
[42:51.85]It's one to six players.
[42:53.85]For those of us that are alone in a room.
[43:00.72]Okay.
[43:02.40]VCR.
[43:02.88]We also got 11.
[43:03.74]11's the TV.
[43:05.36]I'm turning off.
[43:08.75]I'm turning that fucking music off.
[43:10.43]I keep hearing the same loop.
[43:17.50]Yeah, I'm not having that play for like a fucking hour.
[43:19.28]11.
[43:20.40]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[43:23.72]I got 50 minutes.
[43:27.27]11, got it.
[43:30.83]This is the TV.
[43:32.43]An ancient TV VCR combo.
[43:35.56]And weirdly enough, guys, what detective work can you see there?
[43:39.84]The rewind button.
[43:42.26]is broken.
[43:43.04]It's popped off.
[43:44.40]Why is that?
[43:45.46]I'm gonna have to figure that out.
[43:46.52]I'm turning this fucking music off.
[43:49.14]And I'm gonna put on... I'm not putting on Doom.
[44:00.64]Has anybody uploaded like background clown music?
[44:05.21]Here we go.
[44:05.51]How about this one?
[44:05.97]This is creepy circus clown music.
[44:09.83]Is that any worse?
[44:18.68]Okay.
[44:20.46]I got, I got, I got, I'm, I'm, I'm timed.
[44:21.70]Alright.
[44:23.34]An ancient TBVCR.
[44:25.66]Alright.
[44:25.86]Now we got to avoid, we got H. See, this is how, this is why you play with two people because like somebody's the banker in Monopoly.
[44:34.69]So this is the fridge.
[44:38.89]Make sure you guys can still see everything we're looking at here.
[44:41.49]Here's the fridge.
[44:42.67]A high-tech refrigerator.
[44:43.93]It makes ice in different shapes.
[44:46.92]The instructions are simple.
[44:48.20]Add water, choose the shape of your ice.
[44:51.23]Enjoy.
[44:51.71]Okay.
[44:58.67]So we need, so now let's do P. That's P, right?
[45:17.47]P is... This door is locked with a digital code.
[45:21.33]Here's the exit.
[45:23.11]And it's the weird doctor who's looking at me.
[45:25.59]So this is the door.
[45:27.27]And then we got 14, which is this little cabinet over here.
[45:34.52]That's pretty creepy, actually.
[45:35.54]He's just, like, staring at you out of the window.
[45:37.32]14.
[45:42.02]There's a lot of little scenarios in here.
[45:47.37]Why do they all have to have the alien sound?
[45:49.75]This is a different song.
[45:51.95]This is a completely different video.
[45:54.43]Ooh!
[45:55.80]A bag containing little seeds.
[45:58.84]Alright, we got them all, let's take a look.
[46:06.18]A bag containing seeds with this, I can combine this.
[46:09.49]Seeds, high-tech fridge, an ancient DVR combo, VCR,
[46:16.86]And then this thing over here with pluses on it.
[46:21.76]79 plus... Okay.
[46:30.36]Put seeds in the VCR.
[46:33.80]Seeds in VCR?
[46:39.42]No, that wouldn't fucking do anything.
[46:44.84]Seeds into this here.
[46:47.75]so that's fourteen plus thirty right now I can drop those in there, but I can't drop them in the ice machine that's like a little game, alright, so fourteen plus thirty eight so I need forty eight forty nine fifty, fifty one, fifty two fifty two so we're gonna combine these, we're gonna put the seeds into this little like weird machine oh no no no, wait wait wait no, I have to combine them, right?
[47:10.78]yeah, it's fifty two
[47:17.70]How's your fucking Sunday going, by the way?
[47:19.68]What day is it?
[47:26.99]52!
[47:27.01]52!
[47:27.65]There it is!
[47:31.57]It's a machine, so, but, yeah, but don't I have to combine them and then?
[47:35.12]Machine.
[47:35.46]38?
[47:35.82]This machine is special.
[47:39.26]To access it, enter the sum of the four pieces which form it.
[47:47.92]Some of the four pieces that form it.
[47:56.82]There's one, two, three.
[47:57.86]Is it 52?
[47:58.04]The four pieces that form it.
[47:58.90]38, one, 25, 79.
[48:16.69]So, just add them?
[48:20.67]Yeah, there's another piece of the maze.
[48:28.36]If there's another piece of the maze, then... How do I get from... I'm gonna put the fucking seeds into the... Makes ice.
[48:38.60]This is no water, right?
[48:39.46]These are just seeds.
[48:41.93]If I get one more of those alien spaceships...
[48:45.73]What about the 31?
[48:46.23]Let's try the ice machine.
[48:50.89]31.
[48:51.01]Okay.
[49:00.49]35, 30, 47.
[49:03.97]Makes ice in different shapes.
[49:06.59]Do I need a shape?
[49:11.46]What about, let's just, this one, a star.
[49:17.40]35.
[49:18.18]Add this result to a blue number.
[49:23.70]35.
[49:23.72]14.
[49:30.55]Can I put it in the bag?
[49:31.55]Can I dump it out and put the ice in the bag?
[49:33.15]I don't know, I don't have any water.
[49:41.59]How do I get water?
[49:44.85]Can I like turn the TV on?
[49:51.41]Put the seeds in the VHS.
[49:53.15]Yeah, but I don't think that... Does a number correspond with that?
[49:55.65]I don't think it does.
[49:59.11]Melt the TV.
[50:01.54]Pee into the ice machine.
[50:02.78]I don't think that's how it works.
[50:04.22]Pause it.
[50:04.62]Alright.
[50:12.42]Alright.
[50:14.10]Hold on.
[50:17.56]You can only combine...
[50:23.92]I'm just trying to think.
[50:25.50]I'm not cheating.
[50:26.36]I just had to take a sip.
[50:27.76]When I sip, it doesn't count.
[50:31.23]Um... A bag containing strange little seeds.
[50:38.15]An ancient TV VCR, but these are... Can I put the seeds into the TV?
[50:47.54]I feel like I need to combine these two.
[50:52.02]Uh-oh.
[51:01.24]38 requires, I need the other piece of this.
[51:02.92]So where's the other piece of that?
[51:06.67]Is there like, hold on.
[51:07.41]Is there like a, something I could do to like find that?
[51:09.95]You know what I'm saying?
[51:13.19]Like, is there something on this piece that will show me?
[51:29.06]Use the VCR.
[51:31.67]But I, can I, is that a, is that, that's not a machine though.
[51:35.03]91, that's not a machine.
[51:35.89]The machine is orange, is green.
[51:38.89]I can't use the VCR, I can't use the TV.
[51:44.22]I can only, I can make ice, but I need water.
[51:49.00]Or whatever, I can make ice cubes in different shapes.
[51:54.54]But then, when I have an ice cube, I have to combine that ice cube with a blue number.
[51:59.36]But this is just a bag of seeds.
[52:12.32]Will it grow into a bush?
[52:20.97]Am I going to do a hint right now?
[52:27.31]Okay, I'm going to... We're going to do... Here's what I'm going to do.
[52:32.17]31.
[52:33.45]And I'm going to make... I'm going to take... I don't know.
[52:34.96]How about the skull?
[52:41.01]Add this result to a blue.
[52:43.85]Okay, 30.
[52:44.13]44.
[52:44.95]Let's just, what happens with 44?
[52:47.48]Is 44 in here?
[52:49.60]Will it do anything?
[52:55.75]See, this is good because you guys are part of the other people.
[53:00.03]There'd be like four people all being like, hmm, with the TV, and I'm just, I gotta do it on my own.
[53:06.68]I'm the kind of guy that when somebody starts to say a good idea, I finish their sentence with them and act like I had the idea too.
[53:15.72]So I can't do that right now, it kind of sucks.
[53:20.68]So yeah, we take the seeds and we put it into the, yeah, that's what I was gonna say, exactly.
[53:32.59]Yeah, you and I are on the same page.
[53:36.30]There's no 44 in here.
[53:38.42]So... This is 41.
[53:46.94]So that's not correct.
[53:49.21]What about one of the other ones?
[53:50.07]I'll go back.
[53:57.57]Can I just put these two together?
[54:00.06]38, 48, 49, 50... I'm gonna look at 52.
[54:03.72]I'm looking at it.
[54:04.98]That's what I would do.
[54:05.70]I would say that.
[54:09.06]That's not it.
[54:09.56]That's something else.
[54:10.99]That's like a big rat.
[54:13.31]I don't know what that was.
[54:26.30]I don't know what to do.
[54:30.34]The high-tech refrigerator.
[54:33.80]35 plus 14?
[54:35.12]30, okay, 31.
[54:40.42]35 plus 14.
[54:43.61]Ice to the seeds?
[54:45.59]I'm doing a hint.
[54:46.05]I don't care.
[54:49.81]A hint for 14.
[54:55.25]You could always try to plant them, but without soil, they're useless.
[55:01.33]Where am I supposed to get soil?
[55:05.59]I have 40 minutes to beat this whole mission.
[55:12.21]I'm gonna just... I... I only have a few options here.
[55:15.63]And those options are... Just combine these with these.
[55:19.82]So that's 35.
[55:20.22]So this is... Yeah, so this would be... 35 and 14.
[55:22.92]Let's just see if it's in here.
[55:31.84]That's 41.
[55:32.58]That's 55.
[55:32.94]45.
[55:33.10]Is 45 in here?
[55:34.64]41.
[55:34.66]I don't think there's any 40s in here, but that's 41.
[55:42.76]46. 46.
[56:00.71]Come on, what?
[56:06.05]Where are you guys getting 49?
[56:12.97]49?
[56:12.99]Where are you combining 49 from?
[56:16.29]What's 49?
[56:22.82]35 plus 14.
[56:23.54]Oh, alright, I'm a fucking moron.
[56:29.08]Sorry, I forget sometimes.
[56:35.33]49.
[56:35.59]I don't think it's even in here.
[56:41.02]There's no 49.
[56:42.12]We're stuck here.
[56:42.92]We're dead.
[56:43.34]We're going to die in here.
[56:44.66]There's 46.
[56:52.10]We're literally going to die down here.
[56:57.66]Yeah, guys, we're dead.
[56:58.92]We're dead down here.
[56:59.97]We're going to starve to death.
[57:10.11]There's a fucking number on here.
[57:11.61]There's a number.
[57:14.93]Do you see that?
[57:16.00]There's a number right there.
[57:19.22]It's tiny.
[57:20.12]It's 18.
[57:24.40]God damn it.
[57:25.14]Alright, there's 18 down there.
[57:26.84]Should I just grab 18?
[57:33.53]Do I have to combine it with something? 18.
[57:41.81]No.
[57:45.55]The VCR has 18 down underneath.
[57:52.63]49 and 18.
[57:53.13]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[57:56.19]Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
[57:58.05]Why would we go water to seeds into the VCR?
[58:02.96]I just have to get 18.
[58:03.50]I see it.
[58:05.02]I'm like looking at it, right? 18.
[58:15.42]I don't understand this at all.
[58:18.47]There's 18 on this VCR, but what does that even mean?
[58:24.82]I'm going to look at 18.
[58:28.84]If there's no 18 in here, I'm throwing the deck in the air.
[58:48.53]89, 39C, 18.
[58:51.31]Alright, crisis averted.
[58:55.63]Got it.
[58:56.55]A VHS cassette comes out of the video recorder with difficulty.
[59:00.86]Alright, now I got... Now I got VCR into the... Can I play it?
[59:11.72]Into the TV.
[59:13.28]18, plus 11.
[59:14.24]Into the TV.
[59:17.97]That gives us 28.
[59:19.71]29.
[59:19.73]39.
[59:21.65]What?
[59:27.12]It's 29.
[59:31.14]29.
[59:32.56]It only took us... It only took me.
[59:34.74]I'll be honest with you.
[59:35.56]I'll be real with you.
[59:36.10]It took me that much time.
[59:39.53]Gotta pay more attention to the random shit that's all over these things.
[59:44.13]29.
[59:44.47]There it is.
[59:45.73]What is it?
[59:46.82]Boom!
[59:47.72]The cassette is not rewound and the rewind button on the old VCR combo is unfortunately damaged.
[59:52.39]It takes time to come out.
[59:54.97]Press the penalty button.
[60:03.83]Three minutes!
[60:04.60]That's such precious time!
[60:06.70]What?
[60:13.78]What's the fucking point of the VCR?
[60:19.47]So what do I do with the fucking... I discard this, right?
[60:25.69]That's what that means.
[60:26.51]I think I throw this away.
[60:29.69]What is the point of the fucking... So I hurt myself and now I have just a random tape and that don't work.
[60:42.40]Is there anything on the rewind button?
[60:53.58]use the use the VCR back into here 18 and 91. machine 91. no I've what is it what I did is that going to work 18 and 91 is 99 99 99 18 uh 91 99 109 okay there's definitely not a 109 in here
[61:26.18]There's no way.
[61:28.98]They're all double digit numbers.
[61:30.42]There's no triple digits in here.
[61:34.90]No, that's not going to work.
[61:36.42]I just spent all this time for no reason putting a stupid cassette into a TV for no reason.
[61:42.98]No, there are no triple digits, guys.
[61:46.72]And this is... 91 doesn't do anything.
[61:51.28]So what the hell am I supposed to do with this?
[61:56.47]Um, I thought that was gonna be it too.
[62:01.35]What is the tape?
[62:01.91]The tape says, please be kind, rewind.
[62:06.89]There's nothing else on it.
[62:10.59]But I can't rewind it.
[62:12.32]I can't, can I put it back in here and then hit the rewind button?
[62:15.88]No, the rewind button's broken on here.
[62:21.70]Are there any more fucking like numbers that are hidden in here?
[62:28.55]I don't see any.
[62:29.73]What about on the door?
[62:35.05]Nothing on his face?
[62:45.22]Nothing on the pouch?
[62:46.44]No?
[62:50.36]This is still... I need four of these.
[63:00.77]Anybody see anything?
[63:10.12]Look at chat.
[63:10.50]What are you talking about?
[63:13.68]What?
[63:19.62]What's this?
[63:21.90]My... My Kimazi.
[63:24.69]My Kimazi?
[63:32.67]79?
[63:32.79]No, but these are... That's the artist.
[63:43.24]Fuck.
[63:45.38]Where is anything?
[63:46.32]I'm almost going to lose and we have like a thousand cards remaining.
[64:00.12]91 minus 18.
[64:00.80]What do you mean minus 18?
[64:04.86]Why would we... we don't minus from the cards.
[64:12.05]Yeah, 91 is discarded at this point.
[64:14.49]Look.
[64:15.17]See on the top?
[64:16.41]91 has an extra root.
[64:19.37]Once this came out, I had to get rid of 91.
[64:30.28]I'm gonna get a hint for 31.
[64:35.69]I'm gonna get a hint for 31.
[64:40.47]What shape might you actually need, and most of all, what for?
[64:45.72]I don't fucking know.
[64:48.20]A heart, a skull, or a star?
[64:51.28]Doesn't do anything for me at all.
[64:52.72]Zero.
[64:58.38]What shape do I need?
[64:59.56]There are no shapes that I need.
[65:02.10]There's a crack through the TV, the rewind button's broken, and there's a light on the top left.
[65:22.06]Is there anything else?
[65:23.18]I can't see anything else on here.
[65:29.30]You've made zero progress.
[65:35.46]Yeah, I'm very well aware.
[65:38.16]Okay, I'm gonna use a hint for 11.
[65:48.83]You must rewind the tape manually.
[65:53.65]What are you talking about?
[65:56.54]Rewind the tape manually.
[66:03.72]This shit's 81.
[66:04.44]It's 81.
[66:10.06]Are you kidding me?
[66:11.86]Are you fucking serious?
[66:20.33]Rewind the tape.
[66:21.69]Rewind the tape, huh?
[66:24.03]18 becomes 81.
[66:24.35]Why would I have done that?
[66:32.69]Is this the impossible quiz?
[66:40.28]81.
[66:40.74]Come on, let me be right.
[66:44.18]Yeah, yup.
[66:45.12]81.
[66:45.50]Watch this shit.
[66:46.14]Ready?

[67:00.75]Unbelievable.
[67:07.58]Okay, 81 plus 11.
[67:10.58]A bunch of bullshit.
[67:20.51]You gotta start thinking outside the box here.
[67:24.91]Alright, 81 plus 11, get it together, bang, put it in.
[67:30.07]It was 92.
[67:34.63]You found out my diabolical puzzle.
[67:39.82]There was no puzzle.
[67:45.37]Bang.
[67:46.35]Here comes they.
[67:51.17]The despicable Professor No-Side appears.
[67:54.27]You're at my mercy.
[67:55.93]I will destroy this planet and no one, not even you, can stop my evil plan.
[68:05.48]That's it.
[68:07.10]Discard 11 and 81.
[68:14.87]What's on the TV?
[68:15.53]Anything?
[68:15.95]I see hee-hee.
[68:18.32]So what was the point of this?
[68:19.06]I see hee-hee.
[68:26.94]Hee-hee?
[68:27.28]34, 34?
[68:27.32]34?
[68:27.34]Is it 34 plus 34?
[68:30.06]What are these puzzles?
[68:43.64]Is it just 34?
[68:44.32]This guy, like, vaped and blew out, like, a Riddler puzzle.
[68:50.52]Like, give me a break.
[68:55.14]34.
[68:55.20]Is it in here?
[68:55.66]Either that or it's 34 plus 34.
[69:01.77]32.
[69:01.79]13.
[69:01.81]Come on.
[69:14.15]I only have 20 minutes to beat this.
[69:15.47]There's no 34 in here.
[69:18.37]34, right?
[69:18.61]What's 34 and 34?
[69:18.99]34 and 34 is 68.
[69:21.07]68, come on.

[69:45.03]57.
[69:45.11]13.

[70:45.17]Piers, you're at my mercy.
[70:46.21]I will destroy this planet.

[74:18.27]This is not even the right one.
[74:19.29]This is the wrong one.
[74:19.95]That doesn't connect correctly.
[74:21.43]Alright, that was Z. T.

[75:44.76]Oh, don't worry, I'll show them to you, but you guys need to be able to see more.
[75:48.25]Because we're getting way too many items.
[75:51.77]There we go.
[75:52.01]That's a little better.
[75:52.61]Okay.
[75:53.55]We're getting more items so you can know what we have.
[75:56.94]Yeah, we're expanding.
[75:58.00]Okay, so that's 24.
[76:00.12]What?
[76:00.34]Wait.
[76:00.80]Don't go anywhere.
[76:01.54]Check this before.
[76:03.72]Do you see anything on there?
[76:05.02]I'm just waiting for somebody in chat to say something.
[76:09.62]I don't see anything.
[76:15.99]No hidden numbers, no hidden thing.
[76:17.87]I don't see shit.
[76:21.09]I think that's it.
[76:22.31]So that was C. Now we're going to go to A. A is the other puzzle piece, I think, on the side of the wall there.
[76:27.99]Do you remember I told you how I kept on hearing the alien?
[76:36.93]Pause it.
[76:38.75]Do you remember when I told you I was hearing the alien sound?
[76:43.02]And I was like, shut the fuck up, this fucking alien sound is pissing me off.
[76:46.42]It's coming from here.
[76:48.84]It's actually, like, sounds on the iPad.
[76:55.17]Uh... I'll show you.
[77:00.59]How do I, like, turn the volume up?
[77:02.77]Oh, right.
[77:05.19]I'm gonna take a pic of you guys.
[77:12.27]You ready?
[77:25.71]This music was just playing.
[77:33.19]Well, that's enough of that.
[77:38.93]Alright.
[77:39.29]What were we doing?
[77:42.24]A, right?
[77:43.44]Or A, yeah.
[77:43.78]Here we go.
[77:44.52]I have 14 minutes.
[77:47.46]I turned off the music.
[77:52.50]Okay, here we go.
[77:54.94]Oh.
[77:55.62]Music.
[77:56.82]Got it.
[77:59.61]Louder.
[78:00.19]46 minutes gone.
[78:00.81]I know, I know.
[78:01.55]But we're just learning.
[78:02.33]Alright.
[78:02.69]A. I need more space.
[78:04.49]Okay.
[78:05.11]Sorry.
[78:06.01]I just fucking bumped into you.
[78:08.43]A. There's another one of these.
[78:11.12]God damn it.
[78:11.56]There's gonna be another one.
[78:12.38]There's gonna be four of these fucking things.
[78:15.28]How the hell am I gonna figure this out?
[78:16.80]There's like ten numbers on here.
[78:20.38]Well, that's the correct one there.
[78:24.46]and this is not correct yes it is fuck this fuck you table sucks okay that's a uh what about three or three or seven let's go three there we go
[78:53.96]Kitchen, please do not enter.
[78:55.54]So this is the kitchen.
[79:00.10]Can I like... Skull on the fucking door.
[79:04.24]Get skull, ice cube, put it in the door.
[79:06.52]Got it.
[79:09.06]Uh, before we go, let's see, seven.
[79:18.12]Seven is an entrance and obviously an exit.
[79:23.46]And there's also V. There's another layer here.
[79:27.30]I gotta put these together.
[79:29.15]I gotta... This is starting to freak me out.
[79:31.13]Alright.
[79:33.17]Let's move this.
[79:34.11]So this is this door.
[79:36.65]This code goes... I'm going to do like this.
[79:40.19]Because I'm starting to get a lot of things here.
[79:43.03]Let's go like that.
[79:44.14]So these are connected together.
[79:46.36]And then this is... So I need V now, which is like a close-up of the door.
[79:59.02]What?
[80:02.04]Did I just open the door?
[80:05.12]The door opens onto a pretty garden in the middle of which stands Nocide's shed laboratory.
[80:11.50]You need to enter.
[80:12.92]An aggressive guard dog stands in front of it.
[80:15.37]It's impossible to get past while the monster is still here.
[80:22.67]Okay.
[80:24.49]So he has a guard dog that just sits out front.
[80:30.29]Alright.
[80:31.57]Um... Well, shit.
[80:33.83]Now, um... Go back.
[80:37.11]So this is the water.
[80:38.60]I can do... I can get the cube.
[80:40.74]So I have the water, which gives me number 31, which gives me 30.
[80:46.42]So machine, we're gonna do 31.
[80:52.02]Get the skull.
[80:55.69]Add this result to a blue number. 30...
[81:00.13]and 24.
[81:04.97]Go back, what do you mean go back?
[81:08.83]Hold on, one thing at a time.
[81:11.84]So this and this makes the ice cube, which is 30 for 55.
[81:26.98]56, 55, 55, 55, 55, 54.
[81:27.18]31 and 24 is 55.
[81:28.76]Yes, it is.
[81:29.44]Is there no 55?
[81:30.14]Shit.
[81:30.54]What do you mean 54?
[81:33.50]31, 41.
[81:33.58]Oh, it's the... It's not the number up here.
[81:37.02]It's the number right there.
[81:42.11]It's 54.
[81:42.59]No, don't leave game.
[82:09.52]54, got it.
[82:10.99]Ice in the shape of a skull.
[82:13.19]Discard... What?
[82:17.65]Discard 11.
[82:18.07]H and 24?
[82:18.65]Discard... What is this?
[82:20.91]H or 11?
[82:21.33]I don't have an 11.
[82:24.19]I don't see 11.
[82:24.99]What number is this?
[82:25.67]Is it H or 11?
[82:26.39]It's too blurry.
[82:26.93]This webcam sucks.
[82:38.12]And even though it's new.
[82:39.80]It don't matter.
[82:42.28]What did I not discard?
[82:43.14]I... H?
[82:51.13]I don't have that.
[82:52.29]Alright.
[82:53.09]So now we're going to do 54 into 3, which is the skull.
[82:59.98]So we're going to do 54, 55, 56, 57.
[83:08.00]This is gonna get into the kit.
[83:08.86]We're gonna have, like, a whole another, like, thing to do.
[83:11.40]I'm gonna have to get, like, another table.
[83:12.72]56.
[83:16.52]Where's 57?
[83:16.86]57?
[83:17.00]Opens the door.
[83:17.46]Fucking goddammit.
[83:18.30]Get rid of 3 and 54.
[83:20.61]You got it.
[83:21.05]The kitchen.
[83:22.31]Oh, shit.
[83:22.59]Um.
[83:39.64]Here, you can see a good view of this.
[83:46.12]So we've got a stove, a microwave, and then a weird thing over here next to the sink.
[83:53.33]Let's go to the stove first.
[83:55.15]The stove is 89.
[83:59.59]89.
[83:59.79]I can do this shit in a minute.
[84:08.51]89.
[84:08.55]Got it.
[84:08.95]Okay.
[84:09.61]Let's open the stove.
[84:14.34]It's an oven in which little cakes are baking.
[84:16.62]A message is stuck on the door.
[84:18.18]And that's... The message is 73.
[84:19.40]73.
[84:19.72]Okay.
[84:19.88]73 is the... I need to get 73.
[84:27.00]Okay.
[84:27.30]Stove.
[84:27.54]Oven.
[84:27.72]73. 73.
[84:37.13]is the note on the door.
[84:43.69]77, 51, 36, 73.
[84:45.95]Oh, I can't read this fucking thing.
[84:51.36]It's so small.
[84:55.28]Dear, the message left by the oven, probably by the cook.
[85:01.79]Dear Professor, here are the chalk cheddar cupcakes you asked for.
[85:06.79]I've gone to do some shopping.
[85:08.11]If you could just add the cheese at the right time, it would help me.
[85:12.27]P.S.
[85:13.17]To stop the cheddar being eaten by you-know-who, I've locked it in the cupboard.
[85:18.18]I won't give you the code.
[85:19.32]I know you love deduction games, given your intelligence.
[85:23.14]You shouldn't have any problems guessing it.
[85:25.68]P.S.
[85:26.02]Don't burn everything like last time.
[85:31.20]Alright, the cheddar, if you just add the cheese at the right time, it would help me stop the cheddar by being eaten by the mouse.
[85:38.46]We already got spoiled on that, unfortunately.
[85:41.99]It's locked in the cupboard.
[85:43.23]I won't give you the code.
[85:44.21]I know you love deductions.
[85:45.41]We've got to get the code to the cupboard.
[85:47.23]Cupboard is 63.
[85:48.29]Let's go, go, go.
[85:49.17]I have to get another fuck you table, I think.
[85:55.23]63.
[85:55.25]Bingo.
[85:55.55]Here it is.
[85:59.13]A cupboard shut with a combination lock.
[86:01.76]Contains cheese and flies.
[86:04.48]So here's the lock to this.
[86:07.42]So this is the lock.
[86:10.34]It's a four-digit code.
[86:12.88]We got E. E is another one of these.
[86:16.31]This is the... Oh shit, this has like a sausage on it.
[86:27.38]Okay, so that's complete now, but what the hell?
[86:32.58]How do I get to the sausage?
[86:33.78]Okay, hold on.
[86:35.48]I've got six minutes to beat this.
[86:40.37]So, hold on.
[86:42.83]41 is another, I can look at something else here. 41.
[86:52.61]There's a little, like, a window to look through.
[86:54.27]41 is a window.
[86:55.29]A poster of questionable taste decorates the decrepit wall.
[87:01.86]Questionable taste.
[87:05.04]Uh, purple, red, green.
[87:08.88]Oh, wait!
[87:10.54]Hold on, hold on.
[87:11.16]Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
[87:19.17]How many purple... Alright, I got it.
[87:22.73]No, I don't.
[87:28.60]There are one, two, three, there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven purple.
[87:38.18]One, two, three, four, five green.
[87:41.85]And then one, two, three, four, five, six orange.
[87:50.60]But how does that correspond to these four numbers?
[87:53.48]Is it just the same?
[87:54.10]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[87:58.10]So it's just going to be 6, 6.
[88:00.82]We're going to lose.
[88:04.23]It's obvious, very obvious.
[88:05.19]We're going to lose this one.
[88:05.89]But who cares?
[88:06.97]This is fun.
[88:08.01]Okay.
[88:09.17]So it's 7, 6.
[88:09.47]7, 6, 5, 6.
[88:15.42]You got it.
[88:16.73]Done.
[88:18.35]7-6.
[88:19.83]This is the desk over here.
[88:21.29]So 7-6-5-6.
[88:21.79]So I need to do code into code 7-6-5-6.
[88:32.34]The drawer slides open.
[88:33.82]It's overflowing with papers and various documents.
[88:42.19]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[88:51.15]I forgot like where I was.
[88:52.87]Alright.
[89:03.29]Pause it.
[89:04.51]This doesn't count anymore.
[89:05.86]What was it?
[89:06.72]I don't even know what the card just told me.
[89:08.24]Seven, six.
[89:12.94]Shut up.
[89:15.18]I don't want to hear you.
[89:15.78]I want to hear my music.
[89:16.74]The creepy one.
[89:19.74]And I already see people clipping it.
[89:21.66]And that's great.
[89:22.50]I'm pausing it.
[89:23.24]No, wait.
[89:23.70]I need to... 7, 6, 5, 6.
[89:29.82]Draw opens.
[89:30.48]I need card number 9.
[89:31.67]I'm pausing it.
[89:33.55]I don't care.
[89:34.11]Card number 9.
[89:40.89]That's like I just got a surprise birthday present.
[89:46.27]Number 9.
[89:46.67]What's in it?
[89:47.03]Alright.
[89:47.23]What do you guys think is in here?
[89:53.23]Alright, get rid of T and get rid of 41.
[89:55.03]Finally I can start to actually discard this shit.
[90:01.86]Alright, well that leaves us with these rooms, the dog, the maze, the gold, the cheese, the icebox.
[90:10.40]What do I still need this for?
[90:12.88]The drawer is full of papers and gadgets of all kind.
[90:15.83]There's pills in here.
[90:20.55]That's six.
[90:22.06]There's also a number four in there.
[90:23.34]Do you see that?
[90:27.08]I need to like move the camera for the next one.
[90:28.64]Let's go six.
[90:38.73]Six.
[90:43.51]There we go.
[90:44.78]What are these?
[90:45.26]It's a sleeping pill.
[90:48.20]On the dog?
[90:52.32]I think it's the sleeping pill on the dog, right?
[90:57.71]The monster?
[90:59.19]Because it's impossible to get through.
[91:00.75]The monster is still here.
[91:01.73]I'm going to hold on to that for a minute.
[91:04.49]Now put the items up here.
[91:05.53]Do it right.
[91:06.60]Items go up top.
[91:09.18]That's all I got in here.
[91:11.20]That was in this draw.
[91:12.08]Let me just put it underneath so we know.
[91:15.49]There's also a number four with a purple envelope there.
[91:17.79]Don't let me forget that, or I'll never fucking stream again.
[91:20.70]Okay, so... Let's put the timer back on.
[91:24.48]No, we're not.
[91:33.99]Where are we?
[91:34.45]Okay, the oven.
[91:37.77]The... I have the sleeping pill.
[91:43.24]Um...
[91:46.75]The door, the pill, the monster, this.
[91:52.73]I mean, let me see, can I like, where does this, where do you start?
[91:57.14]Where's like the entrance here?
[92:00.70]I have no idea.
[92:04.10]63 is up there, I need the code to open the cheese box.
[92:09.08]I gotta get through here somehow.
[92:11.82]I have the pill, I have the bag of seeds.
[92:21.30]I have this, like, sausage.
[92:25.86]Alright.
[92:26.36]Sausage.
[92:26.76]I'm gonna... Here we go.
[92:27.72]Ready?
[92:29.46]I need to do... I gotta do the maze.
[92:31.09]I gotta do the maze to get to the sausage.
[92:34.25]Hello?
[92:34.89]You will only find four useful objects in the drawer.
[92:37.73]What?
[92:39.33]You will only find four useful objects in the drawer.
[92:41.89]What are you talking about?
[92:46.52]Holy shit, there's a cupcake on here.
[92:47.88]Hold on, there's a...
[92:52.25]78 is that cupcake.
[92:57.51]Oh shit, there's degrees on here too.
[93:00.80]Start time 1217, 300 degrees.
[93:01.82]Does that matter?
[93:02.42]78?
[93:02.52]Should I get 78?
[93:03.08]Because it looks like a... 78.
[93:06.96]And then 4. 4.
[93:29.01]78?
[93:31.51]Oh my god, it's like a whole recipe.
[93:33.15]The page torn from a recipe book.
[93:36.89]Bah.
[93:38.82]Beat three ounce softened butter with 2.5 ounces sugar.
[93:43.28]Add two eggs and the melted chocolate.
[93:46.36]Sift in four and a half ounces flour and a pinch of baking powder.
[93:50.74]Mix well, then add fourth cup of milk.
[93:54.55]Fill the molds with this delicious mixture and bake for 30 minutes at 300 degrees.
[93:59.66]When almost ready, add the cheddar and continue baking until golden.
[94:06.20]Okay, and then four.
[94:11.15]So that's the recipe.
[94:16.49]That's four, come on.
[94:19.05]Four is another part of this book.
[94:23.28]Assembly instructions for a Swedish toy kit.
[94:27.68]Thank you for purchasing the My Key Maze rodent maze.
[94:32.58]To... What do you mean, cheater?
[94:41.47]Cheating?
[94:44.85]Look at... I said that already.
[94:47.67]Look at, four is right there in the green book.
[94:52.27]What are you talking about?
[94:54.94]So here we go.
[94:57.00]To enjoy it, start by fixing the parts of the maze together.
[94:59.96]I did that.
[95:01.12]It's right there.
[95:02.88]Then slip your favorite rodent in the right hole and watch him happily romp around.
[95:10.68]Okay.
[95:13.52]What fun for you and your small pet.
[95:15.36]If he finds the correct path, a well-deserved reward will be released.
[95:19.36]So we gotta pick the right one of these.
[95:22.49]This is instructions for, so we gotta pick whatever one is the right one that gets to the sausage.
[95:30.43]Okay, so I gotta do this, I gotta do this.
[95:33.13]Unpause, I'm not gonna unpause.
[95:35.66]Until I'm confident that it's gonna take one minute and 13 seconds to beat the rest of the game.
[95:42.42]Alright, fine, I was loose.
[95:49.18]Is there still horror music playing?
[95:55.07]I still have fucking scary music playing.
[95:58.39]What do you mean no?
[96:02.27]What do you mean there never was?
[96:05.66]What's playing right now?
[96:09.46]What is going... I see the levels going up and down.
[96:12.43]What is playing?
[96:22.80]There is music playing right now.
[96:34.83]You don't hear this.
[96:37.73]No, that's a live.
[96:38.47]You guys can hear this.
[96:49.72]You don't hear this.
[96:50.58]That's bullshit.
[96:57.40]Ah!
[97:04.30]The countdown timer.
[97:05.84]I thought I heard like an explosion.
[97:10.44]Oh.
[97:11.28]OK.
[97:12.40]The countdown has finished, but time continues.
[97:14.29]You can finish the adventure.
[97:15.45]Alright.
[97:15.81]Well, at least you got the background music.
[97:19.45]Alright.
[97:19.73]So I got to start.
[97:21.17]Let's put that up here.
[97:23.43]I got to find the right one.
[97:24.93]Now bear with me here, because this is really little.
[97:29.88]Sausage out this way.
[97:35.22]Up here.
[97:35.62]Nope.
[97:36.30]This way.
[97:36.90]Around.
[97:38.82]Nope.
[97:39.48]It's hard to do this.
[97:40.30]They're not connected right.
[97:46.86]Fucking come on, man.
[98:04.51]Okay.
[98:21.24]I'm gonna draw on this.
[98:22.50]I need to.
[98:22.86]I have to.
[98:35.37]They all blend together like a magic eye.
[98:38.41]Wait, hold on.
[98:44.82]Fuck.
[98:51.11]God damn it.
[98:51.63]Okay, it's not nine.
[98:53.13]What about this one?
[98:53.77]18?
[98:53.79]18 plus?
[99:16.09]That's not 18+.
[99:16.57]It has to come through this way.
[99:36.18]God damn it!
[99:37.12]I'm gonna get a pen.
[99:38.62]Use the iPad?
[99:39.10]What do you mean, use the iPad?
[99:50.96]Wait, hold on.
[99:52.21]This is a machine.
[99:54.17]It's a machine.
[99:55.75]So 38 into the sum of the four pieces.
[100:00.23]OK.
[100:00.37]26 plus 21 plus 38 plus 15.
[100:15.77]38, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 53, 63, 73, 74, 84, 94, 100.
[100:16.63]No, that's not right.
[100:17.69]26, 36, 46, 47, 57, 58 to nine, 60, 61, 62, 72, 82, now it's 100.
[100:45.10]there's no 100 in here oh my fucking god damn it alright so um can I draw what do you guys think
[101:17.19]No, not that way.
[101:19.83]It is, it's gonna be over here somewhere.
[101:24.11]So down here, around this thing, up and down, right here?
[101:33.61]Oh, it's, that's, whatever.
[101:37.17]It's this one right here.
[101:42.73]Add this number to a blue number.
[101:47.89]One?
[101:49.67]Plus... 15?
[101:51.59]15?
[101:53.67]Because of the seeds?
[101:55.53]No.
[101:58.62]I don't have a number.
[101:59.56]I don't have a... I need a... The pills?
[102:11.82]No, it wouldn't be... I need the sausage.
[102:16.42]What am I missing here?
[102:25.89]I need, like, the mouse.
[102:26.89]63 is locked.
[102:33.82]I'm gonna pee so bad.
[102:37.90]The oven.
[102:38.68]I'm gonna pee so fucking bad.
[102:40.97]I'll be right back.
[103:55.85]Thank you.
[104:51.54]I almost just knocked over all this shit.
[104:54.20]I was really close.
[104:56.45]Okay.
[104:57.87]So how do I... I need to get a mouse.
[105:00.47]Or a rat or something.
[105:08.49]We're back.
[105:09.70]Okay, I need a mouse or a rat to get the cheese inside of this maze.
[105:17.28]How would you do that, do you think?
[105:23.21]A cupboard shop with a combination lock contains cheese and flies.
[105:26.99]I have the recipe for the cheese recipe.
[105:29.93]Is there anything else on here?
[105:32.07]There are the sleeping pills, the recipe, the instructions, and then there's a book.
[105:36.96]Ah, there's a book in here.
[105:39.48]Take a look at that book.
[105:41.76]You can't see it that well, but there is a 37 on that left book.
[105:48.34]I am seriously like, sometimes I think that like I'm the smartest fucking person in the room.
[105:59.32]Yeah.
[106:01.06]I am.
[106:01.24]I'm the only person in the room.
[106:06.18]37.
[106:07.64]37.
[106:07.68]So I am technically the smartest person in this room.
[106:16.12]But I also might be... I could be the dumbest person in the room, too.
[106:21.83]Yeah, I am the smartest and stupidest fucking person in this room.
[106:27.77]There's nobody else in here.
[106:29.21]I'm also the most handsome person in the room.
[106:31.13]I'm also the ugliest person in the room.
[106:44.11]Okay.
[106:46.12]Uh, this is notes.
[106:52.86]Music score, ta-ta-da-da-da-da-dum.
[106:56.92]333135.
[106:57.04]Is there a piano?
[107:06.18]I don't see like a piano or something. 333135.
[107:14.15]I don't understand how that plays into anything else, but it is a musical score.
[107:25.61]Nothing else on here, right?
[107:32.20]This is probably the code.
[107:37.92]This could also be just added together.
[107:43.75]But if it's 18, then why would that matter?
[107:49.37]Is there 18 still in here?
[107:57.92]I don't think 18's still in here.
[108:00.22]18 was already out.
[108:03.16]Yeah, well, 18 was the cassette tape.
[108:07.01]Huh.
[108:09.57]Musical score.
[108:10.63]Maybe the stove?
[108:13.07]I can't, like,
[108:19.21]Put that away for now.
[108:19.91]Let me see if there's anything else.
[108:22.31]There's the door with the dog.
[108:23.65]There's nothing else on there.
[108:25.60]There's a doggy door.
[108:27.26]There's the cage with the cheese in it.
[108:29.62]There's the fridge with the ice in it that I still... I think I'm supposed to... Yeah, I'm supposed to get rid of that.
[108:34.48]Okay.
[108:35.80]I have seeds.
[108:36.48]I have sleeping pills.
[108:39.04]There's the kitchen.
[108:41.20]The maze, which is already done, but I need the mouse.
[108:44.89]So I need to do this shit in the kitchen.
[108:47.13]I gotta do the stove.
[108:54.44]Okay.
[109:00.02]Cheese and... Alright.
[109:01.06]Let me see this.
[109:05.75]Page 12.
[109:06.03]This is the recipe book.
[109:08.51]The start time of the oven is 1217 and it's 300 degrees.
[109:13.85]Fill the molds with this delicious mixture and bake for 30 minutes at 300.
[109:18.74]So it started at 30 minutes and now it's at 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
[109:25.30]Which then bleeds into... Is... could that be... is that four digits?
[109:32.51]Is it just this oven timer thing?
[109:36.65]Let's see.
[109:40.04]Code.
[109:40.38]1217?
[109:42.22]Nope.
[109:42.70]It's not 1217.
[109:47.46]That's wrong.
[109:56.62]Is it whatever was before that?
[110:01.63]It's not 8008.
[110:03.83]It's not that.
[110:10.78]I have no idea.
[110:15.90]Add the cheese at the right time.
[110:17.28]The cheese is locked up.
[110:21.52]It's locked up because the mouse is going to eat it.
[110:27.32]Don't burn everything.
[110:29.84]These are in the oven already.
[110:30.94]Is it... Maybe it's the time that it already was cooking for.
[110:39.16]I think it's the time it was already in there for.
[110:41.56]So, 30 minus 12, 7, that's... What?
[110:42.40]17 minutes and... 17...
[110:57.28]17, um... 30... 40... 17, 40... 43.
[111:04.42]Come on.
[111:11.16]What?
[111:12.68]What the fuck?
[111:13.48]What is it then?
[111:17.15]How do I get this mouse?
[111:19.27]What is this musical score for?
[111:28.35]What are these, the pouch of the seeds for?
[111:33.58]Ugh.
[111:36.02]Sleeping pill.
[111:38.68]Sleeping pill for... Wait, did I do that wrong?
[111:48.84]Alright, I'm gonna use a hint.
[111:50.86]Hint for 89.
[111:54.04]The cooking started at 12.17pm.
[111:58.25]Therefore... Oh, that's what time it is.
[112:05.50]30 minutes.
[112:10.16]So 12... It's gonna be 12... 47.
[112:15.34]Got it.
[112:23.27]You open the cupboard and take the cheese that's hidden behind a cloud of flies.
[112:26.55]Take the card 32.
[112:29.56]Alright.
[112:33.52]Sometimes you gotta use a hint, and we're like 20 minutes over.
[112:37.77]But it's okay.
[112:41.05]32.
[112:42.99]A small piece of cheddar matured for 18 months.
[112:47.84]Alright, I got a lot of things to discard here.
[112:50.08]Oh, don't drop the whole deck.
[112:51.86]Hold on, I must drop the whole deck.
[112:56.34]okay get rid of 68 or 63 which is the one we just opened 63 get rid of 73 78 so get rid of 73 78 63 89 okay so 63 73 78 89 bringing up some space here alright get that over here
[113:27.94]So now I have a piece of cheese.
[113:30.32]Cheese plus the maze, I think.
[113:40.97]Cheese, because that would mean the mouse would come in?
[113:50.97]No, I need cheese plus the dog door?
[113:57.39]Cheese in the sleeping pill?
[114:02.36]Because that... No, no, no, hold on.
[114:03.94]Can I add?
[114:04.52]No, no, no, no, no.
[114:06.28]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[114:08.24]So, hold on.
[114:10.02]Go back to here.
[114:12.48]This was 100.
[114:12.87]And it was... Which one?
[114:15.65]This one, right?
[114:18.69]I don't... I really just don't remember.
[114:19.99]I think it is this one.
[114:23.15]There's a mouse in the kitchen.
[114:25.82]It just yelled at me.
[114:27.79]There's a mouse in the kitchen?
[114:35.72]Oh god damn it, guys.
[114:41.40]Deep, deep, deep in that hole there is a tiny little faint 20.
[114:45.59]You can barely see it. 20!
[115:02.57]There he is.
[115:02.95]A mouse hole.
[115:05.50]20 plus 32 is going to give us the mouse.
[115:12.26]52.
[115:14.26]It's right here.
[115:15.06]Bingo.
[115:16.38]Found him.
[115:21.83]He looks so sad.
[115:24.93]Lured by the cheese, a mouse comes out of the hole.
[115:27.19]You have difficulty catching it, but you succeed in the end.
[115:31.02]now we do this and the maze hold on I gotta clean this up move this over here looks pretty good alright I think I can get rid of this I don't think okay so now which one was it it was up here right this one so now 52
[115:56.11]Plus, so 53, because we already got that one.
[116:00.69]53.
[116:07.65]I think it's in the back.
[116:08.47]I saw it already.
[116:09.25]53.
[116:09.67]No!
[116:09.77]No.
[116:09.87]Just no.
[116:12.35]No.
[116:18.23]No.
[116:27.65]Alright.
[116:32.42]So, what do you mean, no?
[116:43.27]Okay.
[116:46.35]I have maze, correct maze and mouse is not the right answer.
[116:53.67]Correct, what?
[116:58.65]Was it the wrong... Was it the wrong place to go?
[117:03.38]Was it the wrong maze?
[117:12.68]Alright.
[117:14.76]I guess let's try this one over here.
[117:16.04]It must be this one then.
[117:24.47]No, it's not.
[117:35.46]No.
[117:40.02]No.
[117:42.66]These are all wrong.
[117:43.50]None of these are even right.
[118:03.71]This music sucks.
[118:05.62]I don't even know what it is.
[118:06.34]Oh, it's the Halloween music.
[118:09.61]How about, um... Here, I'll make everybody happy for like five seconds.
[118:12.81]Let's put it on Yoshi's Island.
[118:28.74]Everybody thought it was going to be Doom, but you're wrong.
[118:37.52]Alright, that's cute.
[118:40.00]I'm getting to the end here in like another three hours.
[118:43.27]So what's... No, that was correct.
[118:44.99]Because look at all these other ones.
[118:46.87]Oh, shit.
[118:47.93]Okay, hold on.
[118:48.57]52 plus 9.
[119:06.06]60, 60, 61.
[119:07.06]Alright, this is it, right?
[119:18.44]No.
[119:22.91]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[119:30.59]I'm seeing a lot of ResidentSleepers.
[119:33.51]I'm gonna have to wake you guys up.
[119:49.42]oh no no that was a bad idea because well just pretend I didn't do that I was trying to wake everybody up oh it's because of the lullaby and here I am thinking I gotta like do something crazy to wake everybody up and it's the music that's playing and I'm I just added I just ruined the whole playthrough for myself
[120:14.91]I thought everyone was like, oh shit, I'm bored.
[120:18.05]And I'm just like, oh yeah.
[120:22.56]Fuck, it's alright.
[120:24.04]There's gonna be like 40 penalties, but it's not real.
[120:26.30]Okay, so what the hell is, what do I do then?
[120:31.12]So it's not that one, it's not this one.
[120:32.38]Maybe it's this one.
[120:35.02]The one that starts in the corner over here.
[120:46.53]This is it.
[120:47.75]That's not it.
[120:55.18]Got it!
[121:01.47]77.
[121:08.19]Snossage!
[121:09.37]Alright, I got it.
[121:10.11]A sausage that was released when the mouse went over the opening button of the maze's trap door.
[121:15.99]Big subs came.
[121:16.65]Oh, fuck, they did.
[121:19.11]Cyanide.
[121:19.77]Thank you for the 10 community subs, Cyanide.
[121:21.59]Appreciate that.
[121:24.51]Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[121:27.26]Much love to you.
[121:28.00]Thank you.
[121:29.42]We got the sausage.
[121:31.52]That means I can get rid of all this.
[121:40.07]And I can get rid of C4 and 52.
[121:40.83]Mouse is gone.
[121:45.00]Desk does not need to be used anymore.
[121:46.94]C4 and 52.
[121:48.74]Okay.
[121:49.04]Alright.
[121:51.67]We've cleaned up the space a little bit.
[121:54.21]Now I can take the sausage and the dog.
[122:02.85]Right?
[122:03.43]So I can take 77 plus 49.
[122:06.04]That's not going to do anything though.
[122:10.14]I have this sausage.
[122:10.64]Sausage.
[122:15.09]Anything on the sausage?
[122:18.91]Sausage and the pill here.
[122:21.31]Alright, yeah, let's bingo.
[122:26.06]So that's 77, 78, 79, 88, 81, 82, 83.
[122:26.56]83.
[122:26.60]It's a sausage sleep.
[122:45.78]But the sausage can send anybody into the arms of Morpheus.
[122:49.30]I don't know what Morpheus is supposed to be, but now we have 83, which can be used on the monster, right?
[123:02.22]So 83, there's a little doggy door.
[123:06.10]83 and 7?
[123:07.31]Put it like in front of the door?
[123:10.59]That sounds about right.
[123:12.19]I think that's a good idea.
[123:14.95]So 83 and 7.
[123:15.67]Let's get a 90.
[123:17.30]Maybe he'll come through the door.
[123:25.77]There it is.
[123:26.17]Sausage on the door.
[123:29.45]You open the door slightly and carefully throw the sausage in the garden.
[123:32.99]Noises of something being wolfed down can be heard immediately.
[123:36.35]After a few seconds, chewing noises are replaced by deep snore as the dog has fallen asleep.
[123:41.50]You will finally be able to get out, but No-Side's voice suddenly comes from a loudspeaker.
[123:49.13]Did you really think it would work so easily and I let you go like that?
[123:53.89]Click clack, the door is now locked.
[123:55.65]The evil professor really does not want you to save the Earth.
[123:58.93]Take card five.
[124:00.07]783.
[124:00.09]783 and V. Alright, take card five.
[124:16.32]This music doesn't really fit, but it's okay.
[124:22.39]Five.
[124:22.77]What's the big secret here?
[124:25.63]The door is now locked.
[124:31.08]So there's no reason to do any of that.
[124:37.52]What?
[124:38.76]We're just back in.
[124:39.42]The door is now locked.
[124:41.24]There's just a big key.
[124:44.72]Anything else on the door?
[124:49.15]What the hell am I supposed to do now?
[125:08.80]Seeds on the door.
[125:10.34]What's that gonna do?
[125:10.94]A bag of magic seeds.
[125:14.14]That's not gonna do anything.
[125:18.02]Do I still need to do something with this?
[125:20.12]The musical note.
[125:25.96]I can't climb through the doggy door.
[125:27.88]It's not gonna work.
[125:31.78]Can I do seeds on the- why would that work? 19?
[125:45.37]No.
[125:47.64]I sprinkled the seeds in front of the door.
[125:50.16]That's not gonna do anything.
[125:55.42]There's nothing on here?
[125:57.78]Nothing, did I lose?
[126:13.25]The bear?
[126:16.95]Guys... You can't see it, but the doormat in front of the door... That's 46 on it.
[126:26.59]I was trying to do something cool and it didn't work.
[126:43.00]You found a key!
[126:43.92]That's that!
[126:44.46]Why do you keep... Don't keep your key!
[126:47.05]under a rock in the front of your house.
[126:49.54]That's a really stupid idea.
[126:51.84]I know a lot of you guys do that.
[126:53.20]Let me tell you something.
[126:54.42]That is the equivalent of having your password be password.
[126:57.44]It's been... This shit's been happening for fucking hundreds of years.
[127:04.25]Why do people do that?
[127:07.21]Oh, where's your key?
[127:07.97]Oh, I just have the way to get inside of my house just right in the fucking front of the door underneath the mat.
[127:16.52]So just leave your door open the whole time.
[127:19.08]Criminals will exploit that.
[127:20.34]Don't do that.
[127:21.54]Have a... Windows open this time.
[127:28.43]Got him.
[127:31.45]I honed in on the license plate.
[127:33.07]I could see it.
[127:33.53]Alright, so I got a key.
[127:37.89]Key 46 plus this goes obviously into this door.
[127:41.22]Oh, you'll never escape.
[127:44.82]Can I, like, break into his fucking bank account, too, with the 123456, which is his idiot, like, boomer password?
[127:51.91]Alright.
[127:54.77]46.
[128:04.83]A charming little garden worthy of a house in the suburbs.
[128:07.61]Oh, would you look at that?
[128:08.47]Discard 5 and 46.
[128:09.03]So we got a faucet.
[128:15.27]We've got a dirt, and we've got an R here.
[128:19.45]R is the lock.
[128:21.09]So let's take a look at 56, which is... I'm going to make sure you get a screenshot of that so you can see what we're doing.
[128:28.57]Okay.
[128:29.65]Let's go with the water faucet, 56.
[128:31.10]I'm almost out.
[128:35.52]56 is the water faucet.
[128:37.94]Oh.
[128:39.37]Do you guys remember the very beginning of the stream when I saw the card that I thought was the teacher's aid, like teacher's cheat sheet?
[128:45.00]This is the one.
[128:48.14]The water inlet pipes have fallen down.
[128:50.20]You must find the right ones to get water.
[128:59.63]well it's a machine so I can I'm gonna use the machine over here alright so let's not hold on don't get too hasty here don't get too hasty we're still going 58 is just the dirt in the ground there it is right everybody everybody do it everybody do it I know you're going to so let's wait like five minutes for you to get it out of your system
[129:33.95]I know I need a haircut, stop saying it.
[129:35.41]Uh, a brown substance, granular and slightly damp.
[129:40.01]It's, yes, it's soil.
[129:42.69]Didn't I need soil?
[129:43.59]I need soil for the seeds.
[129:45.93]Okay.
[129:47.02]Hold on here.
[129:52.04]This fucking Super Nintendo music.
[129:54.48]I'm not sure if it's keeping people or driving people away.
[129:57.72]And thank you, Cyanide, for the 10 more community.
[129:59.63]I got it right away.
[130:01.36]Thank you for the 10 community sub sign, I appreciate it.
[130:03.76]10 more.
[130:07.98]On top of the ones you gave earlier too, thank you.
[130:10.67]Alright, um, R. You need to get in, this room contains a weapon of mass destruction.
[130:29.45]Okay, inside of his shed is like a nuclear bomb of some sort.
[130:35.12]Okay.
[130:37.06]So that's it.
[130:38.74]So let's go ahead and think about this.
[130:40.12]We're going to do the soil and the seeds.
[130:42.68]So that's 58 plus 14 is 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72.
[130:58.97]Tada!
[130:59.43]The seeds are well planted in the nourishing soil.
[131:04.21]So now we've got seeds in the soil.
[131:06.23]Get rid of these two cards now, we don't need them anymore.
[131:09.68]Sick.
[131:10.92]Okay, now we gotta do the water here.
[131:14.10]So 50, we got the machine, 56.
[131:17.18]Alright.
[131:19.22]So I need to... The water inlet pipes have fallen down, you must find the right ones to get water.
[131:29.52]how do I which one goes first down left find the right ones one okay hold on do I press this button and then hit okay no I'm trying but what do you mean find the right ones
[131:59.56]I need one, two, three.
[132:02.46]I need like four of them.
[132:05.42]Or three of them.
[132:12.99]I can't like drag and drop though.
[132:15.43]It's one connection, two, three.
[132:17.69]Maybe three of them.
[132:19.45]It looks like this one here.
[132:21.33]So it needs to go like down, down.
[132:23.77]This one.
[132:26.77]Do I have to press them all?
[132:27.79]Okay, I'm an idiot.
[132:29.17]Alright, so.
[132:30.53]It's this one.
[132:31.93]And then we need like a little snake one.
[132:34.82]So this one.
[132:36.64]And then we need this one.
[132:38.28]How does that make any sense?
[132:40.50]What are you talking about?
[132:41.10]I lose one minute?
[132:50.83]Yeah, because look, it goes... I need one that goes down like this.
[132:55.57]So it's this one here.
[132:57.65]Right?
[132:58.67]That makes sense.
[133:00.15]That's right there.
[133:03.42]And then I need one that goes bang, bang, bang.
[133:06.30]Which is this one here.
[133:10.12]And then one that goes bang, bang.
[133:14.99]Straight down.
[133:15.91]It's this one right here.
[133:17.73]How's that wrong?
[133:23.62]Yes, yes, this is it.
[133:27.14]Yes, I did it, right?
[133:28.90]Yes, I did it.
[133:30.76]Everyone's like dancing, I must have done it.
[133:38.84]What?
[133:43.02]So two, three, nine.
[133:45.40]That's nine.
[133:51.95]Nine plus 72?
[134:10.49]Wait, wait, wait, it's not even, it's not showing the other side!
[134:14.89]Why is it not showing the bottom left?
[134:21.88]Hold on a minute.
[134:27.64]This, it's not showing me the whole thing over here.
[134:36.67]So it needs to go down, down, down, down.
[134:40.55]Okay, okay, I got it, I got it.
[134:41.88]So it's... Because this is not on here.
[134:47.24]That's bullshit.
[134:51.18]So it is this one.
[134:52.00]And then it goes this one.
[134:57.48]And then it has to go to the other one down there.
[134:59.38]So it's this one...
[135:10.98]I have no idea what the fuck is going on here.
[135:15.26]Because I don't know why it's missing the ones on this.
[135:20.56]Wouldn't it just be all of them except for one?
[135:26.27]Because then it would be this... I don't even... I don't understand why you would even... You got all these numbers here.
[135:36.21]What are the numbers for?
[135:38.80]But at least everyone's having a fucking fun time dancing.
[135:40.72]I must be doing something right.
[135:43.04]Alright, so then 16 plus 72.
[135:45.70]Because of obviously this.
[135:46.70]72.
[135:49.34]82.
[135:49.36]88.
[135:49.50]Bingo.
[135:49.90]What is it growing?
[135:59.55]Piranha plants?
[136:04.33]Massive subs just came in.
[136:05.71]Holy god.
[136:08.72]20 community subs.
[136:10.80]Atrolux Atrox gave 20 community subs.
[136:15.86]Holy fuck.
[136:20.83]That's... Thank you.
[136:22.33]That's a lot.
[136:23.43]Thank you so much for the 20 subs.
[136:31.08]That's a lot of subs.
[136:33.22]56 can go, 72 can go.
[136:34.88]I can't wait till my like grandkids play this.
[136:38.42]Ooh, the flowers grow instantly, both a magical and beautiful show.
[136:44.12]So what?
[136:45.48]What did that even do for us?
[136:49.30]Is there something?
[136:50.02]Wait a minute, there's the different colors.
[136:54.06]Orange, purple, orange, purple, orange, purple, purple, orange.
[136:56.98]What does that mean?
[136:58.28]What is that for?
[137:01.18]It's the musical notes.
[137:02.55]Take a look at this shit.
[137:03.19]Look at this.
[137:07.79]Look at that.
[137:09.67]Three, three, three.
[137:11.09]One.
[137:12.95]Three.
[137:14.02]Fuck.
[137:17.22]Never mind.
[137:17.64]There's an extra one.
[137:33.40]one three three one three five there's too many one two three four five six one two three four five six seven eight so where are these this is that one and this is that one so these two are both six or something
[138:03.59]What the fuck is happening right now?
[138:05.70]Flutters just gave 30 subs.
[138:10.24]30 community subs from Flutters.
[138:13.40]30.
[138:14.14]20 from Atchalux.
[138:15.26]30 from Flutters.
[138:19.62]Thank you for the huge amount of community subs.
[138:22.90]You guys are way too generous.
[138:23.90]Thank you.
[138:26.61]I was just about to rip this in half, but then how would my grandkids ever be able to finish it?
[138:32.87]That's a lot.
[138:33.75]Thank you for the fucking huge amount of subs.
[138:40.16]I'm gonna turn the brightness up so you guys can see.
[138:41.97]Because it's getting a little darker outside.
[138:59.09]There we go.
[138:59.55]Okay.
[138:59.73]What?
[138:59.87]Um... It's something to do with the notes.
[139:07.57]The musical notes.
[139:08.21]But what?
[139:08.45]It's really washed out now?
[139:09.41]I got you.
[139:09.71]Hold on.
[139:40.88]Better?
[139:51.41]No?
[139:52.69]Better?
[139:53.21]Better.
[139:54.11]Better!
[139:56.47]Okay, we got... these.
[139:59.67]The timer's broken.
[140:00.69]No, it's because I went like this.
[140:03.95]This whole- this is meaningless.
[140:05.05]We're just using this for the machine portion.
[140:08.01]Alright, hidden numbers.
[140:12.49]I don't see anything on here that's a hidden number.
[140:14.15]I need like a magnifying glass.
[140:28.61]But when, what do I?
[140:29.67]I need to get in this room.
[140:32.45]98, what's, what, hold on.
[140:33.65]Machine, no, code.
[140:58.96]1, 2, 3, 4... Well, they're... 3... 3... 3... 5?
[141:01.52]3, 3, 3, 5?
[141:01.70]Is that it?
[141:02.84]Did I get it?
[141:28.60]Incorrect.
[141:33.70]Are you... lacking?
[141:36.50]No, I don't think so.
[141:40.22]Three, three... How about three, one?
[141:43.25]Three, one... Five?
[141:57.30]3, 3, 3, 6.
[141:57.38]No.
[141:57.44]3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1.
[141:57.56]5, 3, 1, 6, 5?
[141:57.66]3, 1, 6, 5.
[141:57.74]Let's see if that does it.
[142:32.64]God, does this have anything on it?
[142:35.46]It's, alright, look, this one's purple.
[142:39.07]It's purple.
[142:39.51]It's the purple ones.
[142:40.21]Whatever the purple ones are.
[142:41.29]It has a little purple face on it.
[142:42.47]Can you see that?
[142:44.95]You can't.
[142:45.93]But trust me, it's purple right here.
[142:48.59]It's a little purple guy.
[142:51.08]Alright, so then it's 3, 1... 4, 5?
[142:52.36]3, 1, 5, 4? 4?
[143:01.33]Because those aren't on there.
[143:02.93]3, 1, 5, 4?
[143:05.59]Ah!
[143:09.87]That's really washed out, but it's okay.
[143:12.61]Uh, the laboratory contains a huge screen showing a satellite image of the Earth, towards which a hundred missiles are pointing.
[143:19.79]How can you stop it?
[143:20.89]Yes, look at the ceiling.
[143:22.43]Take card 36.
[143:23.13]He has a bunch of missiles pointed at Earth.
[143:33.17]Yeah, usually in like these Saturday morning kids cartoon villains, they like... They don't do anything like this.
[143:41.98]Usually it's something like... I stole the ice cream maker.
[143:46.74]And now you'll never make ice cream again, and no one will ever be happy.
[143:49.72]Or like, oh, my rainbow machine is... I stole it.
[143:53.83]This guy is trying to destroy the fucking Earth with missiles.
[143:57.89]This doesn't happen.
[144:03.23]Okay, so get rid of pretty much everything.
[144:04.87]We got one more really clever puzzle to do to get rid of this one.
[144:09.97]Get rid of 9, 37, 51.
[144:10.55]9, 37, 51.
[144:10.61]88.
[144:11.03]51 is already gone.
[144:11.85]No, it's not.
[144:12.61]Okay.
[144:14.58]That leaves us with this.
[144:15.46]Why do I still have the kitchen and shit out here?
[144:28.88]Alright.
[144:30.22]Let's get these in the good view here.
[144:32.17]So we got this machine.
[144:33.29]A cage is hanging by a chain from the ceiling.
[144:37.31]Choose the right maneuver to get down.
[144:41.21]Push the lever to the left.
[144:43.33]Take card G to do that.
[144:45.83]Or push the lever to the right.
[144:47.11]Take card D. This might be a death scenario.
[144:53.45]So push the lever to the left or the lever to the right?
[144:57.75]So if I push the lever to the right, that would mean we would be going this way.
[145:07.63]So this way, which would make this purple one go this way, which would make... You know, it's the same amount of... It's the same chance as roulette.
[145:22.04]So, I mean, just put it on black or red.
[145:26.02]I'm going to say put it on red.
[145:28.49]push it over to the right this way means it'll go this way which will spin this this way which will move this one this way which will move this one
[145:58.33]this way which will move this one this way which will move this one this way and it'll go down we're taking card D it's to the right D here we go
[146:36.03]Nothing in my hand, right?
[146:37.69]Nothing in my hand at all.
[146:38.45]I got nothing... The cage slowly descends.
[146:45.15]Creaking, it is closed by a coded lock.
[146:47.26]Hurry to open it and press the button that will stop the destruction of the planet!
[146:55.12]I think that already happened.
[146:57.34]See, I don't know.
[146:57.88]I haven't been outside in like fucking probably four hours.
[147:01.02]So I might just be in the bunker and the Earth is probably gone.
[147:07.32]Hurry to open it and press the button.
[147:08.74]What do you mean?
[147:09.14]How do I... Hurry up and press it.
[147:11.98]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[147:12.50]Okay.
[147:13.80]The cage slowly... What's the code?
[147:16.90]I see... Okay, I see... Dash?
[147:21.65]Do you see that?
[147:24.77]On the bottom of the cage, there's a dash, star, dash, dash, dash, star, dash, star, dash, dash, dash, star, dash.
[147:31.21]Is that Morse code?
[147:31.95]I'll show it to you.
[147:33.75]Look.
[147:38.96]It's so fine.
[147:40.91]It's hard to see it.
[147:47.63]So, 1... Hurry up and do it before the bomb explodes.
[147:52.71]1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1.
[147:54.77]1, 3, 1, 3, 1.
[147:55.95]Um...
[148:10.38]You mean congrats.
[148:12.99]Why is everybody saying good job?
[148:18.19]Congrats.
[148:25.77]Oh, the music.
[148:32.12]Okay.
[148:36.40]I'm like, we're getting like gross lips right now.
[148:38.66]The cage slowly...
[148:40.74]Hurry up, or the planet will be destroyed.
[148:45.85]Dash star dash one three one three one one three one one one three one one.
[148:53.17]What's that mean?
[149:00.10]One, one two three, four and two.
[149:03.94]I don't know.
[149:14.63]Read it upside down.
[149:18.13]Dash?
[149:18.41]No, that doesn't have to do anything.
[149:21.21]Uh, code.
[149:22.78]I'm gonna say... Alright, we gotta move this out of the way.
[149:26.92]Um... It's four digits, so... I have... I don't fucking have any idea what it... The star... There's two different numbers.
[149:38.33]1, 3, 1, 3...
[149:49.38]1, 3, 1, 3, 1.
[149:50.60]1, 4, 3, 1?
[149:51.98]1, 4, fucking... Everyone's dead by this point.
[150:16.94]This cage makes you think of a code with bars.
[150:19.81]Where do we usually find barcodes?
[150:24.81]How the hell does that help me?
[150:28.49]I know.
[150:32.98]Look for the answer on...
[151:01.74]Am I really getting Metal Gear Solid right now?
[151:08.63]This is not even the right box.
[151:11.07]Where's the bottom of the box?
[151:24.62]There's the barcode.
[151:33.28]Uh, it is... You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[151:37.25]It's this barcode on the bottom.
[151:39.73]It's the actual barcode on the box.
[151:44.25]I would have never figured that out in a million years.
[151:46.73]I would have gave up.
[151:47.43]I would have had to quit.
[151:48.51]I would have started flipping cards over.
[151:53.50]The code is 3... 5... 8... 3... What?
[151:55.10]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[151:59.88]The code is... 5... 8... 0... 6.
[152:01.72]That's...
[152:24.62]That's some Metal Gear Solid shit right there.
[152:26.56]You press the button and no side's evil device stops after releasing a few electrical flashes.
[152:30.69]Well done, you have saved the world!
[152:33.57]That's all, folks.
[152:37.88]What about these other cards?
[152:55.16]That was not 112 minutes.
[152:56.48]I pressed the button a million times.
[152:58.02]60 minutes of added stuff.
[153:00.34]It would have been three stars.
[153:01.36]It would have been.
[153:04.26]I would have had a nice three stars on this.
[153:09.26]I would have.
[153:12.47]I pressed the penalty button like 30 times.
[153:14.39]What's with the other cards?
[153:15.73]Should we reveal these?
[153:19.15]I'm not going to play this again.
[153:20.03]No.
[153:22.41]No.
[153:25.32]No!
[153:25.60]Oh, these are all damage, like, you, these are all you lose cards.
[153:30.58]No.
[153:32.10]Yes, of course.
[153:33.10]Yeah, these are all, like, you failed.
[153:35.18]I didn't see very many of these.
[153:36.96]So.
[153:38.98]Alright!
[153:39.60]That's, well, that one's done.
[153:40.94]That was, uh, the sausage one.
[153:42.38]So, let me ask you this.
[153:45.48]Uh, for this, I got two more of these.
[153:53.17]It's time to transition.
[153:56.45]It's time to transition to a little bit of wine.
[154:03.16]Or should we put this away?
[154:11.52]No more!
[154:14.50]What, you didn't like squeakin' sausage?
[154:16.70]You didn't like this?
[154:19.56]It was fun.
[154:21.54]I thought it was good.
[154:26.79]What are you saying?
[154:27.23]I can't even see what you're saying.
[154:28.19]What are you saying?
[154:37.40]What is... Alright, get this shit out of here.
[154:41.86]You scratched your iPad.

[159:57.53]And we have to move on.
[160:00.29]I'm really going to try.
[160:10.72]Get really drunk and then gamble with Mario.
[160:12.58]I'm not going to get that drunk.
[160:16.62]Alright, let me grab something to drink.
[160:19.47]That was a little trial run.
[160:20.57]I know what I'm doing now.
[160:29.64]I think, what do you think?
[160:30.72]Dinosaur or Wild West?
[160:34.32]Plus, the tutorial was like 20 minutes.
[160:36.66]I had no idea what the hell I was doing.
[160:40.40]Wild West or dinosaurs?
[160:41.86]I'm going to say dinosaur.
[160:45.31]This one apparently is hard.
[160:48.71]This is the hardest one that I have.
[160:50.93]So I've got to fucking get this shit done in exactly one hour.
[160:57.44]And for every penalty I have to drink.
[161:00.16]I'm just kidding.
[161:01.06]I'm not doing that.
[161:10.60]Is this one ages 12 and up?
[161:12.25]This one is still 10 and up.
[161:13.85]Alright, I'm not going to reveal the deck yet.
[161:16.83]And hold on.
[161:17.27]You know what?
[161:17.55]I'm going to make this faster.
[161:18.65]I'm going to make this quick.
[161:19.41]Hold on.
[161:22.61]Alright.
[161:22.93]Let me go.

[161:32.13]I'll be right back.
[163:14.45]Alright, I got something a little different here.
[163:19.23]This is not the usual wine, unfortunately, guys.
[163:25.11]I'm sorry to say.
[163:25.89]I got something else.
[163:33.15]Kim was telling me, what are you doing?
[163:35.53]Where are you going with that?
[163:40.68]And I was like, no, I'm not going anywhere.
[163:42.64]Hold on.
[163:52.90]I've got some sake.

[164:26.79]You're drinking Liquid Evil.
[164:29.45]Why do you say that?
[164:32.09]Drink with every card pull?
[164:35.79]I am not going to fucking do that.
[164:41.42]Pull for which deck?
[164:42.28]Alright, that's the hour.
[164:43.14]You know, if this is going to be the one.
[164:45.44]This is the one, then that's a good idea.
[164:47.60]We'll pull with the Dinosaurs or Wild West.
[164:51.40]I am already messing up my words.
[164:56.98]This is the only reason why anybody voted for this.
[165:02.15]Hey, you want to do another fucking card game?
[165:05.07]No, no, no, anything but that.
[165:07.35]Do anything else.
[165:09.03]I don't want to see this again.
[165:11.45]Hey, but... I'm going to be drinking.
[165:16.75]Okay, alright.
[165:18.49]That sounds great.
[165:21.37]Do that.
[165:24.17]Alright, let's do Dinosaur World Wild West.
[165:29.46]Ew.
[165:29.64]Alright, give me another poll because that makes sense.
[165:34.15]We should do it like that.
[165:40.13]You only do boring shit drunk.
[165:43.55]Would you rather I do exciting shit drunk?
[165:46.54]No.
[165:52.12]I make this... What could I do exciting?
[165:58.10]Well, what can I play right now that's exciting?
[165:59.76]Drunk.

[166:03.10]I got one hour.
[166:06.27]Alright, guys.
[166:07.05]Which one do you want to see?
[166:07.85]Which deck?
[166:08.25]This is important.
[166:08.95]This is the last time you're going to see this.
[166:13.27]You should play Just Dance.
[166:14.93]Why would I ever turn that game on?
[166:18.30]Why would I... I don't want this to be biased.
[166:20.22]Hold on.
[166:25.38]There you go.
[166:31.18]For our entertainment.
[166:34.00]Oh, but for those of you that... I've got some news for everybody here.
[166:37.94]People are going to like this.
[166:41.38]There's something that I told you about that I was working on that is going to happen now, probably.
[166:51.43]Got a good lead?
[166:53.97]There is a very interesting stream coming up here in the next... I don't know.
[166:59.49]I actually got a good lead on it.
[167:03.59]You'll see.
[167:03.95]I've talked about it a few times.
[167:07.32]And it's going to be more elaborate than I think you think.
[167:11.12]I think people think this is going to be a little one and done little thing, but just wait.
[167:14.32]There could be way more on top of this.
[167:25.75]Dino it is.
[167:31.23]We're going to unlock the dino deck.
[167:34.29]And just because I wanted to be completely prepared for this, I am completely prepared for this.
[167:39.47]I've got Super Mario dinosaur music.
[167:43.21]And I'm not gonna waste any fucking time.
[167:47.15]So here comes dinosaur music.

[168:46.80]Something like that.

[169:34.14]By the way, don't drink unless you're fucking the right, correct age to be able to do it and enjoy it and... Be responsible when you drink.
[169:42.28]Go get a card game and play it with some friends and shit.
[169:45.90]I don't know.
[169:46.60]Don't be an idiot.
[169:51.24]I've never even had sake before.

[170:38.42]Something like that.
[170:38.92]Alright, are we ready?

[172:34.05]And it's going to be a problem for me, so... That's better?

[173:41.36]Good idea.
[173:42.38]Very good idea.
[174:10.44]They're already sorted.
[174:11.76]There's no, um, there's no letters.
[174:13.92]It's already sorted.
[174:16.42]There are fucking a million of these.
[174:20.54]Okay, you ready?
[174:24.30]A young woman knocks at the door of your agency, your private investigating agency.
[174:31.02]Sort by number.
[174:33.28]You know how long that's gonna take to do that?
[174:38.31]I have to, you want me to put every single one of these in order?
[174:41.76]That would take like fucking 30 minutes.
[174:42.86]What do you mean do it?
[174:45.52]No, I'm not going to sort it.
[174:46.74]No, I can't.
[174:47.42]That's the part of the game.
[174:50.40]That's, I have to go one, I have to go one to a hundred.
[174:56.77]I'm going to throw them.
[174:58.11]I'm going to fucking throw them if you keep this up.
[175:00.55]Don't fuck with me.
[175:01.25]I'll do it.
[175:03.03]I'm just going to whip them to the back of my door.
[175:08.17]Don't do it.
[175:08.61]Don't make me do that.
[175:10.81]I'm fucking gonna do it.
[175:11.73]I see it.
[175:12.17]If I see one more of these... You won't do it.
[175:17.02]No, I won't.
[175:17.40]You're right.
[175:18.02]That person.
[175:18.64]Thanks for saving the stream.
[175:20.12]Alright, here we go.
[175:23.58]My name is Gladys Ungerton.
[175:26.69]My friend Ned Malone has gone missing.
[175:29.55]You've probably heard about him.
[175:31.51]He's one of the members of Professor Challenger's Expedition.
[175:34.86]They've recently returned from the Lost Valley full of strange creatures.
[175:38.78]I just received this notebook and this odd message.
[175:42.29]I don't understand a word of any of it.
[175:43.79]Can you please go to the offices of Professor Challenger?
[175:49.17]If you are true to your reputation, you will bring Ned back to me.
[175:53.79]Should you accept to help Gladys take the survival guide and card 53?
[175:57.59]I need that thing.
[176:13.03]There it is.
[176:16.75]Okay, I need 53.
[176:19.48]And then launch the app and hit start, and then flip this card over when you start it.
[176:23.48]So I need card 53.
[176:29.08]Don't start the, you don't start the timer yet.
[176:36.02]By the way, if I do this in one hour, and I actually get to the end in one hour,
[176:41.67]I want 5,000 subs.
[176:53.32]If I don't get to the end of an hour, I want negative 5,000 subs.
[176:58.05]So I'll just kill my whole channel. 53.
[177:11.74]I'm going all in on this one.
[177:14.14]Big bits came in.
[177:16.26]Cyanide, another $50.
[177:17.54]Do it, coward.
[177:19.56]What do you think I'm doing?
[177:23.36]Okay, I got my survival guide.
[177:24.79]I've got my 53.
[177:49.74]I'm not taking it.
[177:50.32]I'm just getting it ready so I don't waste any time.
[177:52.65]How many pauses am I allowed?
[177:53.57]Go.
[177:56.17]We got a desk.
[177:57.41]I got a little light.
[178:00.61]Fifty-three.
[178:01.77]Fifty-three.

[179:22.49]That's the book I need to get into.
[179:24.11]In addition to Alice in Wonderland, it's impossible to open the book as long as it bears this combination padlock.
[179:28.52]So there's a combination padlock on it.
[179:30.04]It's got an F and a C on it, and one of them is cold.

[179:57.30]Hydrate.
[179:57.94]Okay.
[180:04.01]Anything on the candle?
[180:11.75]This says it in the book.
[180:12.71]Okay.

[181:38.47]It's not 1050.
[181:39.15]It would be... No, it's 5010.
[181:49.60]I don't want to lose any more time.
[181:50.56]5 fucking thousand subs are on the line.
[181:55.32]I...

[182:20.38]Fourteen.
[182:34.85]I'm fucking doing, I'm trying so hard.
[182:37.53]14, I can see 14 in the corner from the painting.
[182:41.44]16, 80, 99, 25.
[182:41.74]Give me, what is fucking 14?
[182:48.70]What?
[182:48.88]It's a coconut.
[182:58.34]Behind the painting you find a strange coconut Coconut, smash the coconut with the horn 42, okay, a high quality shoehorn, smash the coconut 42 plus 14 Is 42, 52, 56 It's right on top, 56 is right on top Smash the coconut
[183:25.97]I am so fucking- I'm on top of this right now.
[183:28.27]I ain't gonna lose.
[183:30.29]I need a discard pile up here.
[183:33.37]The coconut opens in the middle.
[183:34.77]It holds a mysterious machine.
[183:37.72]Latitude, longitude.
[183:39.26]What is that?
[183:39.64]56.
[183:42.40]Machine, 56?
[183:44.58]Enter destination.
[183:45.60]Latitude, no.
[183:46.82]Longitude, no.
[183:47.76]I need a map?
[183:50.57]A map.
[183:52.69]I need latitude and longitude.
[183:59.34]Alright, I gotta get a map.
[184:00.34]I gotta find a map.
[184:00.80]Okay, I got a candle.
[184:03.22]This painting's still.
[184:06.86]Okay, I don't have any.
[184:08.06]I got nothing for that.
[184:11.62]What?
[184:11.94]How do I get in this fucking book?
[184:16.59]What's this supposed to... 36.
[184:24.51]15.
[184:24.53]How do I get in the fucking book?
[184:27.31]F and C?
[184:27.79]F?
[184:35.40]I don't know how to get in the book.
[184:36.17]I don't know what this even means.
[184:47.59]I know it's Fahrenheit and Celsius, but there's no other information on this book to give me any leads.
[184:55.00]It's like not 50 and 10.
[184:57.58]So what the hell is it?
[185:00.30]Fahrenheit, Celsius.
[185:05.17]I got no longitude.
[185:06.09]I got no latitude.
[185:07.03]I've got a painting, but there's nothing on that painting.
[185:08.67]I got this weird scissors.
[185:10.43]Rock, paper, scissors.
[185:12.77]Lemons.
[185:18.55]Can I... burn these two?
[185:22.37]Oh!
[185:29.13]50, 60, 70, 80. 86?
[185:35.96]87, 89?
[185:37.10]Burn the, burn it?
[185:38.04]89, come on!
[185:47.81]Come on!
[185:48.17]89, 89, 89, 89, 89, 89.
[185:53.61]80. 88.
[186:07.41]87... 89.
[186:10.98]What?
[186:11.18]36... Alright, what the fuck happened?
[186:17.80]Okay, discard 36 and 53.
[186:21.28]Get rid of these.
[186:21.84]I just did it.
[186:22.40]Okay, discard.
[186:24.70]What the fuck does this even say?
[186:27.93]Woods, in the form of our voyage and a few of natural history and Gito...
[186:35.37]could of interest to the general public help enter both latitude and longitude rates by teleporter to our, the five of us.
[186:44.96]We are in great danger.
[186:46.38]Ned.
[186:48.96]Each coordinate is made of a ka followed by two, I will, nobody can read that.
[186:58.46]Each, there's more of this.
[187:01.69]I'll help you with the it is for minute, ugh.
[187:13.79]Each coordinate is made of a K followed by two.
[187:17.15]I will help you with the, it is the for minutes and look on the lower right side for the other row.
[187:25.52]Beat the and enter Challenger's initials.
[187:32.16]Lower right side of what?
[187:49.79]Of the car!
[187:51.17]A look on the lower right side of the car.
[187:52.72]I have to get into this book.
[187:58.50]Fahrenheit, Celsius.
[188:01.40]It's 50 and then this is 10.
[188:06.97]But then there's that weird little symbol that's flying around.
[188:17.85]What is that symbol?
[188:18.67]Is there like a squiggly?
[188:55.72]Latitude?
[188:56.16]No, that's not it.
[188:59.72]It's his initials and then something.
[189:01.82]I'd have no idea.
[189:15.10]Enter both latitude and longitude rates.
[189:17.35]Be teleported to our... The five of us.
[189:20.97]We are in great danger.
[189:24.92]The rock?
[189:28.32]N rock?
[189:29.08]E scissor?
[189:30.12]W paper?
[189:33.19]What the fuck does this even mean?
[190:04.01]dot dot dash dot dash dot dash dot Is F and C on here?
[190:12.95]Yeah, but that's just Morse code, but I need to translate that into four digits.
[190:32.07]50-10- I tried 50-10 earlier, it didn't do anything.
[190:48.22]This is fucking bogus!
[190:57.92]This painting is Japanese, but I don't have that information in my book.
[191:12.07]How the fuck are you supposed to do this in 60 seconds?
[191:15.87]I mean, very clearly, F and C are right here.
[191:20.94]Why would it be F and C?
[191:24.88]With the squiggles around it.
[191:43.80]These are just the dinosaurs.
[191:45.08]There's no squiggly lines.
[191:53.29]Do you see squiggly lines on here?
[191:56.43]I don't.
[191:56.75]His name is G.E.
[192:03.37]Challenger is his initial.
[192:04.91]So it's G.E. 5010?
[192:15.68]Wait, there was, there was, where were they?
[192:17.18]Where, where, what are you talking about?
[192:18.10]Where?
[192:18.22]What are you talking about?
[192:23.62]Where do you see them?
[192:24.08]I don't see them.
[192:28.09]What do you mean right there?
[192:29.11]Where do you see these?
[192:38.55]No, you're lying to me.
[192:39.39]There's nothing here.
[192:44.06]There's nothing on this map that has squiggly lines on it.
[192:54.35]I can't even get the fuck out of this first puzzle.
[193:02.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[193:04.22]Is there F and C here?
[193:12.74]No.
[193:18.91]G, E. But then I need the longitude and latitude.
[193:21.84]It's like rock, paper, scissor.
[193:23.80]F, C. But is the wave, is this the wave, the painting?
[193:31.57]14?
[193:31.59]C is 14?
[193:31.91]No.
[193:32.03]What the fuck?
[193:48.43]There's no lettered cards.
[193:59.71]C in blue is for Celsius, F is for Fahrenheit.
[194:03.99]So what the fuck are you talking about, game?
[194:09.36]F is clearly on 50, C is very clearly on 10.
[194:17.01]5010.
[194:17.89]How does this make no sense?
[194:19.33]I tried that already.
[194:23.59]GE 5010?
[194:24.91]On this dumb machine?
[194:26.29]No, but this is like latitude, latitude, north.
[194:41.92]Scissors.
[194:42.30]This doesn't make any sense.
[194:46.12]This makes no sense.
[194:49.72]I have rock, paper, scissor.
[194:53.55]And then 50 and 10.
[194:58.09]Is this like element shit?
[195:03.05]Rock is north, but what is... Rock?
[195:14.60]See...
[195:19.69]North Rock.
[195:25.97]East Scissor.
[195:43.99]I got no fucking idea.
[195:49.97]Like zero idea what the hell they want me to do.
[195:55.51]There's no way I'm gonna do this.
[195:56.67]Okay, minus five fucking thousand subs.
[195:58.55]This is not possible.
[196:05.20]What the fuck are you talking about?
[196:06.44]Okay, let me tell you how dumb this is, okay?
[196:13.96]Apparently the red number is for boiling temperature.
[196:21.15]Why would I ever, ever, ever, ever, ever think that?
[196:30.02]How would I, what information is here?
[196:33.30]Boiling temperature?
[196:37.56]What?
[196:42.49]I'm gonna boil the card.
[196:44.97]So, it's...
[196:48.05]Oh, but boiling in Fahrenheit is what, 212?
[196:53.69]So 212, and then the Celsius is just, what, for freezing, which is zero.
[197:01.44]2120.
[197:02.32]What a dumb fucking thing.
[197:05.64]By the way, that means it's boiling, if you didn't catch that.
[197:10.00]This game owes me 5,000 subs.
[197:19.04]It's not open.
[197:19.64]Five.
[197:20.10]Take the card five.
[197:20.82]Padlock opens.
[197:21.46]Five.
[197:31.66]A number is at the bottom of the book page.
[197:32.95]Ooh, there's it.
[197:33.45]Really?
[197:34.17]There is.
[197:34.41]Yep.
[197:34.57]Thank you for that.
[197:35.29]I didn't press that.
[197:36.39]It just gave it to me.
[197:37.09]Okay, here we go.
[197:38.11]36 minutes.
[197:38.61]I can do it.
[197:38.93]Discard.
[197:43.31]How am I supposed to read?
[197:44.03]The book is open.
[197:44.59]It says 34 and there's a
[197:48.36]not supposed to read that okay it's a bunny and a lady 34. come on come on please I'm fighting for my life here
[198:16.08]34.
[198:16.20]Look at how... Do you see how much text is on this?
[198:23.89]This volume holds, in the form of a diary, the account of our voyage and a few short remarks about natural history and geology that I believe could be of interest to the general public.
[198:34.05]We needed to study the lands and follow the right coordinates left behind by the previous explorers so to confirm whether or not there was a hidden valley in which huge animals hid and needed to be saved from the desert people who killed them out of fear.
[198:50.57]We also wanted to check on the coordinate pointing to a bird called the Red Cardinal presumably living on the highest point.
[198:59.80]We were missing several of the digits and therefore we couldn't find the latitude
[199:04.59]We went as far... This is a joke.
[199:08.93]The text gets smaller.
[199:10.69]They couldn't fit it, so they shrunk it.
[199:15.25]We had planned to... We went as far as we could to the south.
[199:18.92]We had planned to stay, but after a few seconds, we were attacked by a very big dinosaur and chased by an even bigger rabbit.
[199:43.30]There's like lines going through this.
[199:48.90]L-C-D-G?
[199:53.57]The line is... What a disaster.
[200:06.75]There's clearly a line here.
[200:10.79]Going through...
[200:14.52]You're supposed to do this in an hour.
[200:17.26]No.
[200:18.24]No way.
[200:19.05]Well, like, two or three.
[200:30.08]I have to read this whole essay again.
[200:31.54]Hold on.
[200:43.55]What the fuck does this even mean?
[200:46.25]Cardinals?
[200:48.89]Check on the coordinate pointing to a bird.
[200:50.89]The red cardinal.
[201:13.19]I wanna see a dinosaur.
[201:14.19]Dude, I got no fucking idea.
[201:19.97]A bird called the Red Cardinal, presumably living on the highest point.
[201:29.32]We were missing several of the digits.
[201:35.04]And therefore we couldn't find the latitude.
[201:36.66]We went as far as we could to the south.
[201:38.92]We had planned to stay, but after a few seconds we were attacked by a dinosaur.
[201:55.81]I'm going to smash the table.
[202:05.73]This is like so convoluted.
[202:09.79]I need magnifying glasses to read this.
[202:20.39]Camp.
[202:23.33]Stream.
[202:24.27]Central Lake.
[203:07.53]A rabbit and a lady?
[203:14.30]None of this makes any sense to me.
[203:16.43]Just give me a hint.
[203:17.75]I don't even understand.
[203:21.53]The rabbit has a strange posture.
[203:23.40]What is it playing at?
[203:37.09]Is this supposed to be like a constellation?
[203:45.37]Rock.
[203:48.01]He's doing rock.
[203:51.17]But... But who cares?
[203:53.39]He's doing rock.
[203:55.81]North.
[203:56.33]Rabbit north.
[203:59.67]North?
[204:04.55]Rock north?
[204:09.18]is she doing paper north but what does the rabbit even mean is there like a rabbit up north a rabbit named anything
[204:43.66]Why do I even have this still up here?
[204:57.98]Have I tried solving the puzzle?
[205:00.20]I'm returning this one.
[205:01.02]This one doesn't count.
[205:04.96]Nah, this one don't count.
[205:20.15]It's like you gotta find this one little thing.
[205:23.02]How did you not know that F was talking about boiling water?
[205:26.74]You're supposed to know that the rabbit was pointing to a rock, which was the cardinal, which the cardinal was shouting.
[205:33.22]Oh, give me a break.
[205:42.87]Dude, your driving exam, your driver's ed exam has text bigger than this.
[205:49.91]When you put your eyes in the fucking microscope thing.
[206:02.68]When you do like the test to see if you need glasses for like the driving exam.
[206:09.00]They're bigger than this.
[206:10.73]So thankfully I don't need glasses to operate a car.
[206:16.97]We went as far south as we...
[206:22.26]I don't fucking know.
[206:23.34]Rock.
[206:23.92]North.
[206:24.74]Rabbit.
[206:29.11]I don't know.
[206:30.07]Rabbit.
[206:30.57]North.
[206:30.95]Rock.
[206:31.75]But what is rock?
[206:32.63]Rock is rock on here?
[206:40.86]Coconut.
[206:41.82]Painting doesn't do anything.
[206:44.00]Any hidden numbers?
[206:45.70]We already have 34.
[206:51.03]34.
[206:51.07]Anything on the cardinal?
[206:53.07]How is this ages 10 plus?
[207:18.03]No, no, you got help by like four adults.
[207:20.57]You're not doing this at 10 plus.
[207:23.63]You can't even fucking read at 10.
[207:26.09]You can't read at 10 years old.
[207:31.48]Age is 10 and up.
[207:32.24]No, that's like the fucking ESRB rating.
[207:35.28]There's no blood in this game.
[207:45.81]I have no idea.
[207:49.61]Just give me the fucking solution, I'm done.
[207:54.69]I have the solution here, I don't care.
[207:57.17]This makes no sense.
[208:06.78]Okay, so it's... Here's... Listen to me, okay?
[208:13.15]It's north... It's the page... It's the pages in the book that are the...
[208:19.84]No, no one would.
[208:20.58]Why would you ever?
[208:21.45]That's not even like.
[208:53.23]It's bullshit.
[208:55.86]And you know it.
[208:57.32]You all know it, I don't have to say anything, you know it.
[209:04.38]It's the page, it's the page, it's the latitude.
[209:07.18]Not like any of these other, it doesn't matter.
[209:09.00]Oh, come on.
[209:15.90]They got a lot on the line here.
[209:17.12]34 and, where's 89?
[209:23.40]already over there now what this okay so this just changed this is now very important apparently you have been
[209:51.21]You've been teleported to Challenger's Base Camp in the Lost Valley.
[209:55.09]You must find Ned.
[209:56.77]To obtain a better score, you will have the opportunity to find and save the other members of the expedition.
[210:01.31]Their health deteriorates every night.
[210:06.13]Use the app to indicate your movements and take the shown cards to reconstitute the map.
[210:13.65]To interact with a card with an anchor, you must be on its space.
[210:19.25]The other objects are transported with you.
[210:21.25]Good luck and be careful.
[210:22.79]Now take card 81.
[210:24.13]It's the first part of the map.
[210:41.50]81.
[210:42.56]The air is humid and stuffy.
[210:47.08]So we got the tent and then the ground.
[210:49.16]So 93, 45.
[210:49.34]Did I go by 93 already?
[210:49.84]Is the timer still on?
[211:19.61]93 and 45.
[211:20.89]You got an empty bottle and a used chalk stick.
[211:29.64]Day one.
[211:31.84]Okay.
[211:32.94]Chalk and bottle?
[211:41.68]Any hidden numbers buried in the back of the tent?
[211:45.98]I don't think so.
[211:48.84]We're going to go left.
[211:52.20]You come to a mangrove.
[211:53.46]Take the card 87.
[211:53.94]We're going to get the timer erupt.
[212:05.37]88, 90, 75, 27, 87.
[212:05.49]Okay.
[212:22.39]There's a... there's a pterodactyl here.
[212:30.71]Uh, let's... a four?
[212:32.23]I guess we're gonna see what the pterodactyl does.
[212:34.25]Can we tame the pterodactyl?
[212:36.65]This strange creature is playing with a rope.
[212:40.44]Empty bottle and rope?
[212:43.42]This also has an anchor, though.
[212:44.46]What's the anchor mean again?
[212:49.56]You must be on its space.
[212:53.50]I have to be on the anchor space to use that.
[212:59.05]So, I have to be here.
[213:03.55]Should I do rope and bottle?
[213:05.05]What would that even do?
[213:08.95]Well, let's do 26.
[213:11.61]A torch.
[213:17.78]Chalk, bottle, torch, pterodactyl.
[213:28.78]The torch is not lit.
[213:31.42]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[213:33.24]Day 2.
[213:36.04]A vast lowland is laying in front of you.
[213:37.89]Take 52.
[213:38.23]Okay.
[213:47.53]There's a buck?
[213:48.55]A huge deer stands in this lowland.
[213:50.33]It looks peaceful.
[213:51.03]40.
[213:51.05]A huge rock.
[214:00.35]Okay, we got a huge rock, torch, bottle.
[214:03.09]Can I light the rock on fire?
[214:08.81]I don't think so.
[214:11.21]Torch on rock.
[214:11.97]Chalk on rock.
[214:13.45]Chalk on rock.
[214:15.17]Mark the rock.
[214:19.10]No.
[214:19.88]Let's go right.
[214:21.90]Swampy, you're moving slowly in a swamp 82.
[214:34.61]84, 13, 28.
[214:34.69]Come on, 82.
[214:35.37]82.
[214:35.39]I'm running out of room here.
[214:42.30]82.
[214:44.54]That is a huge animal's trudge in the marsh.
[214:49.53]We need 7 and 21.
[214:50.33]I'm gonna have to fucking knock the table over and just do it on the ground.
[214:56.75]Use rock on self.
[214:58.83]Like smash the rock into my own head?
[215:00.22]I don't think that's a good idea.
[215:09.75]Seven.
[215:14.20]There it is.
[215:17.70]A boot.
[215:18.66]A lightly laced shoe.
[215:20.38]Okay.
[215:22.34]Shoe.
[215:24.72]Look at the swamp water.
[215:25.74]21?
[215:30.84]What does that mean?
[215:32.77]I need 21. 21.
[215:39.18]23, 19, 31, come on, 21.
[215:39.70]There's a gun in here.
[215:53.50]Uh, Roxton's rifle, his name is engraved on the butt.
[215:58.53]Okay, I got a gun.
[216:01.15]Machine, 21.
[216:02.71]Use gun.
[216:03.97]How many bullets?
[216:09.35]I have two bullets left.
[216:19.28]God damn it, there's only two bullets left.
[216:24.74]Look closely at the swamp.
[216:26.10]Hold on.
[216:26.46]94. 94.
[216:52.01]Oh, I found him!
[216:54.31]Leaning against a tree, Roxton speaks incoherently.
[216:59.80]You must find a way to lower his body temperature or he will die.
[217:06.20]A torch on Roxton.
[217:10.23]Get the torch out.
[217:12.65]Rock.
[217:14.53]His body temperature... Alright, hold on.
[217:19.03]Okay, he's here we need a torch a bottle of warm sake Okay, I got torch shoe let's go over here You retrace your steps that's a forest, okay, wait whatever Night is coming you make a makeshift camp Wait, wait, wait, he's right there.
[217:47.18]He's right there.
[217:47.58]I found him.
[217:47.90]Oh
[217:49.99]So, these are the people that are alive still.
[217:52.41]I don't know what that person is.
[217:54.37]He's okay.
[217:56.11]Day two.
[217:58.33]Um, alright, I... Shoot the pterodactyl with a gun?
[218:07.13]Shore of a huge lake.
[218:08.35]It's impossible to cross at ten.
[218:14.22]Lake.
[218:15.16]Bottle of water.
[218:16.68]I'm gonna try to scoop up some water, I think.
[218:24.18]This huge lake goes all the way down to a dangerous rapid.
[218:29.04]And then this 32... There's so many fucking cards here.
[218:33.26]You need like 10 people to play this game to keep track of this shit.
[218:37.54]I'm going at unfair odds here.
[218:40.96]So there's a paddle over on that clearing.
[218:48.45]So I've got a large lake, maybe a boat?
[218:56.57]That's nothing down here.
[218:59.73]There's nothing over here either, I gotta go up.
[219:04.01]No, what?
[219:15.01]I know that, I know.
[219:18.16]The ground is shaking under your feet, you hear an immense din, 29.
[219:24.69]I'm just like picking up items.
[219:26.15]I'm not doing these things.
[219:37.35]A huge geyser periodically blasts hot boiling water.
[219:42.54]Okay.
[219:44.02]Boiling water into the bottle and then like dump it on the guy.
[219:51.24]So we get 28.
[219:54.64]Or would you make him drink it?
[220:05.56]28.
[220:05.82]Bang.
[220:06.76]A narrow fissure.
[220:10.04]Okay, this is a machine, so 28.
[220:11.10]So what?
[220:27.10]What is it what about how is this a machine what is this supposed to what am I doing here?
[220:30.08]What does that mean Is that morse code if that's morse code then that's ridiculous 51 You're on a huge cliff
[220:59.81]The faces of this cliff are too steep to be climbed up and there's something on 13.
[221:05.61]Oh my god.
[221:06.26]I'm so overwhelmed right now.
[221:08.30]I have no fucking idea.
[221:09.30]13.
[221:09.32]A cave at the foot of a cliff.
[221:24.53]So there's a cave I can go in.
[221:27.29]Torch in cave.
[221:29.44]26 plus 13.
[221:30.02]Let's do it.
[221:30.42]26 and 13.
[221:30.58]26, 36, 39.
[221:32.84]Let's go.
[221:33.12]No.
[221:33.18]I can't even press the penalty button.
[221:35.52]There is no penalty.
[222:04.23]So, uh, no torch in cave.
[222:08.18]Unfortunately.
[222:20.01]Graveyard, 97%.
[222:27.38]No penalty, just disappointment.
[222:28.90]Yeah, oh my... This... I need... There's more cards out than I have room on my table.
[222:44.44]Uh, gimme $20 just gave $100.
[222:45.48]Well, you gave me $100.
[222:46.26]So, apparently, it's gimme $100.
[222:47.14]Uh, thank you for the $100.
[222:57.25]If you stream Layers of Fear 2, please bring back the Orson Welles sub sound.
[223:04.16]Well, thank you Gimme20Dollars for the $100.
[223:05.84]And... I don't know if I could ever bring that sound back.
[223:12.46]Because that's all you would hear the whole stream.
[223:16.25]He wants you to give him $20.
[223:17.63]Well, I can't.
[223:24.17]Speaking of can't.
[223:27.48]I'm about to drag my hand across this.
[223:32.66]I don't have enough room for this.
[223:43.39]Sixteen.
[223:44.09]How long have I been streaming for?
[223:47.01]Almost four hours?
[223:49.25]Why does it feel like ten minutes?
[223:52.21]Sixteen.
[223:52.97]Hold on, hold on.
[223:53.59]Just give me a second.
[223:54.99]A small clock.
[224:01.02]There's too many cards.
[224:04.38]Do I have a bowling alley or do I have like a desk?
[224:15.05]Like, couldn't you just do this whole game in the app?
[224:17.65]What do I need the deck of cards for?
[224:18.77]I'm slowly coming to this realization here.
[224:30.15]Recent chalk, look at this.
[224:46.61]This is a three star dip.
[224:48.29]10 years old, give me a fucking break.
[224:51.09]A 10 year old is gonna do this?
[224:52.65]10? 10?
[225:01.31]The skull of a strange creature.
[225:02.93]That's 19.
[225:03.31]Unlock would like to access the microphone.
[225:10.85]Why do you want to access my microphone?
[225:24.51]Hello?
[225:27.23]Hello?
[225:29.34]Hello?
[225:34.89]Hello, hello, hello.
[225:36.71]19.
[225:53.15]Hello?
[225:54.97]Is anybody listening to me?
[225:55.99]Why did I just give that permission to my microphone?
[225:58.37]Ah!
[226:09.71]This is the skull of a possegolovosurflas blow into the horn to communicate.
[226:39.15]Where is the mic on the iPad?
[226:44.45]I'm gonna pass out if I keep doing that.
[226:58.36]Approach your mouth to the mic of your device and then blow into it.
[227:03.66]Where's the mic?
[227:10.30]I don't know where the microphone is.
[227:24.81]You hear heavy steps getting closer.
[227:26.59]It's the T-Rex.
[227:29.19]You'd be better off not provoking it for the time being.
[227:41.38]What was the point of that?
[227:44.74]Alright, I have so many items.
[227:46.01]Let me just... I thought that was a siren, like the cops were here.
[227:52.93]People are dying.
[227:54.87]I'm looking at my items.
[227:56.21]Alright, you suddenly wake up alarmed by raptors' groans.
[227:59.42]Hurry, you must flee from them.
[228:01.54]The raptors surround you.
[228:07.93]Uh, two, five.
[228:09.61]Uh, six, uh, three.
[228:11.81]Oh, that's incorrect.
[228:13.13]What?
[228:16.28]Should I take the gun?
[228:22.58]The gunshot scares the raptors.
[228:24.02]They run away.
[228:24.64]You can resume your adventure.
[228:29.02]I have one bullet left.
[228:35.64]Hold on.
[228:36.18]Or chop.
[228:37.67]Knife.
[228:39.91]Rock.
[228:41.27]Smash the rock with the ore.
[228:43.39]Step on the rock with the boot.
[228:45.33]Put the ore in the fissure.
[228:46.91]Put the torch up the rock.
[228:51.25]Put the rock inside of the fissure.
[228:56.81]The rope.
[228:57.29]The pterodactyl has a rope.
[228:59.83]Burn the rope that the pterodactyl is holding and he'll explode.
[229:03.00]It'll be like an explosion.
[229:05.02]Um, there's like hylogryphics here.
[229:09.86]Take the tooth.
[229:14.08]Put the boot onto the tooth.
[229:16.66]Alright, it was Morse code.
[229:29.95]I can't believe it.
[229:30.65]Get to the fissure.
[229:32.41]Where's that fissure?
[229:39.44]28 dang dang dang
[230:09.19]S O S There's somebody inside this fissure, but how do I get in there?
[230:30.14]How do I do that?
[230:30.56]There's somebody in there?
[230:35.58]I need the rope from the pterodactyl, but how do I get that- shoot the pterodactyl!
[230:45.75]Four, here's the pterodactyl.
[230:48.97]Throw- hit him with the oar?
[230:58.90]I still have to- there's still shit up here that I can't see.
[231:05.22]Alright, well, this guy up here is dead.
[231:11.31]No, dense forest.
[231:12.25]I can't even go over to these.
[231:14.61]Nothing.
[231:15.31]Why haven't I had them on the map?
[231:18.05]I gotta get the rope from the pterodactyl.
[231:29.34]He's very close.
[231:35.37]When you wake, you discover a dumbfound that you have set up your camp next to a nest of triceratops.
[231:39.47]What can you do to pass unnoticed?
[231:46.19]Unlock would like to access speech recognition.
[231:48.70]Speech data from this app will be sent to Apple to process your requests.
[231:52.12]This will also help Apple improve its speech technology, useful for some riddles.
[232:05.03]Hey, get out of the way, you stupid!
[232:10.75]Get out of my way!
[232:13.11]Hey!
[232:24.06]Do I really have to scream into this?
[232:27.80]Oh.
[232:29.10]You slip through silently and resume your adventure.
[232:32.22]I was supposed to be quiet.
[232:42.94]How do I get the rope from the pterodactyl?
[232:47.04]This is the ultimate expedition here.
[232:54.65]Glass boot... Boot on... Bottle on the tooth?
[233:02.39]What about 45 and 16?
[233:06.68]I feel like I'm going coupon hunting with you guys.
[233:10.75]Can I put the tooth in the bottle?
[233:18.49]Boot on head.
[233:23.83]Is there a Spongebob song playing in the background?
[233:31.92]Oops.
[233:32.78]Shoe on head.
[233:45.92]How much time do I have left?
[233:51.66]Chalk.
[233:53.02]Let me look at the chalk.
[233:53.58]Wait, there might be a number on the chalk.
[234:00.98]Hold on.
[234:04.46]A used small chalk stick.
[234:09.83]This is the worst stream of 2019.
[234:24.12]Cheers.
[234:27.87]T-Rex!
[234:28.17]Run!
[234:30.39]What's happening?
[234:31.47]What's going on?
[234:32.11]What is... Why do I hear, like, screaming?
[234:40.88]Why are we getting chased?
[234:42.46]There's nothing here.
[234:43.20]We got T-Rex.
[234:44.96]You do?
[234:45.62]Awesome.
[234:46.00]You guys have sleepy dart blaster.
[234:48.21]Can you take on T-Rex for us?
[234:49.59]Yeah.
[234:49.83]Okay, come on.
[234:50.55]Here, we'll just hide behind you.
[234:53.78]What?
[234:59.76]I don't know what card this is.
[235:02.53]It's Rick and Morty.
[235:05.09]Who's Rick?
[235:26.13]I'm not putting that back on.
[235:37.99]Fuck.
[235:38.27]I thought this was going to be fun.
[235:40.29]It kind of is, but it's not.
[235:43.73]I'll be honest.
[235:44.97]I'm trying, you know?
[235:45.99]I'm trying.
[235:46.67]I'm trying.
[235:49.73]What do I do?
[235:58.37]Okay, um, so what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[236:08.15]Okay, I've got chalk, I've got a gun, I've got a paddle, I've got a fissure, I've got an SOS, I've got a cave, I've got a pterodactyl with a snake in his mouth, I've got, um, the horn, I've got my pamphlet, I've got, uh, the boot,
[236:29.45]I'm going to shoot the pterodactyl.
[236:33.45]Shoot the deer.
[236:36.27]Can I shoot the deer?
[236:42.14]So there's a deer here.
[236:43.36]It's 52.
[236:43.56]Alright.
[236:45.98]Shoot deer.
[236:48.96]I hope you're right.
[237:00.13]The deer runs away and comes back a few minutes later.
[237:02.59]I don't have any bullets left.
[237:11.34]Fuck.
[237:12.72]Okay.
[237:23.05]I need that rope.
[237:23.91]I need...
[237:27.40]I have to feed this creature.
[237:28.70]I need to feed the pterodactyl to get the rope from the pterodactyl.
[237:32.12]I don't have any food.
[237:34.42]I can't get any food.
[237:35.20]I just tried to get food by shooting the deer, but the deer wouldn't die.
[237:54.57]Paddle in the
[238:21.45]You think you heard a noise under the rock.
[238:24.22]Find a means to lift it.
[238:28.88]Why would I ever do this though?
[238:30.20]Like the paddle and the rock, it's just such an obscure thing to do.
[238:35.48]This card does not emanate a noise.
[238:39.22]There's no sound on this card.
[238:41.48]I can't fucking hear anything.
[238:44.52]Why would there be a noise here?
[238:50.88]That just said, you heard a sound from under the car!
[238:52.92]And I did a hint on this car.
[238:54.00]Why would I hear a sound from under here?
[238:57.91]Why would I ever think to do the ore in the rock?
[239:00.59]Unless I did that hint.
[239:01.47]72.
[239:05.21]Let's see if there's somebody under the rock.
[239:16.36]The huge rock wobbles and gives you access to a cave.
[239:22.75]Progress, let's go.
[239:26.85]Go in the cave, 72.
[239:48.07]But how do I use the torch in the cave?
[239:53.31]26 and 72?
[239:54.17]98?
[239:59.74]How do I use the torch?
[240:09.26]Did the timer run out?
[240:10.14]Not yet.
[240:10.60]Timer's still going.
[240:16.73]Sparkles could help you light the torch.
[240:18.73]I don't have the torch lit, so I can't go in here.
[240:22.99]That was for nothing.
[240:25.05]I need Sparks.
[240:27.83]Didn't I have a candle?
[240:29.27]Is that gone?
[240:34.29]What about the claw?
[240:37.36]26 and 16, could I like... Let's try that.
[240:40.90]36. 42.
[240:54.03]Let's see it.
[240:54.47]Let's see if I can get some Sparks.
[241:02.87]There's no 42.
[241:03.23]Wait.
[241:03.48]26, 36.
[241:03.64]37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42.
[241:04.60]It's 42.
[241:05.54]There's no 42.
[241:05.98]I have to see this to the end.
[241:26.88]Torch on the boot?
[241:28.40]Like Tom and Jerry style?
[241:29.46]Like a cartoon?
[241:34.82]The gun is empty.
[241:38.16]What did the horn even do?
[241:42.87]The horn didn't do anything.
[241:46.37]Huge lake?
[241:50.13]45 and 10 maybe?
[241:50.97]To get some water from the lake?
[241:52.09]45 and 10.
[241:55.46]55 let's see let's see there we go bottles filled with water now get rid of 45 alright I got a bottle of water now so now I gotta give the bottle of water to this guy roxton speaks you must find a way to lower his body temperature or he's gonna die give him the water how the hell do I bring this guy the water
[242:24.01]How do I do that?
[242:28.63]Hydrate, okay.
[242:30.71]Good call.
[242:45.58]By the way, people that are freaking out right now, just be aware
[242:50.56]the uh sake is a very low alcohol content so it's not it's like a little bit it's like a little bit higher than wine it's not like drinking like shots of straight liquor so don't worry it's essentially wine so it's not that much alcohol pretty nice liquidated company um
[243:33.63]It's hitting me now.
[243:36.03]Not this.
[243:37.97]This.
[243:55.47]I ain't done.
[243:57.09]I'm going to see this shit to the end because this was like 50 bucks.
[244:00.97]for all of these and I'm gonna do it and then me and Kim are gonna play the fucking Wild West one on our own don't fucking blow it now I'm almost done and then as long as I beat this within the timer I get five thousand fucking chops
[244:27.97]Alright.
[244:28.95]Dinosaur.
[244:30.19]How do I get the fucking thing out of his mouth?
[244:34.22]Have we got any ideas?
[244:41.12]I got a full bottle of water now.
[244:45.81]SOS.
[244:46.67]I need the rope to get in there.
[244:47.83]I need meat.
[244:54.09]I don't know.
[244:55.11]I don't know what to do.
[244:56.05]I'm going to...
[244:57.86]Boot and claw.
[245:01.78]What's the boot for?
[245:02.64]I'm going to throw the boot.
[245:04.50]I'm throwing the boot at the fucking pterodactyl.
[245:06.63]Seven and four.
[245:09.45]Eleven.
[245:09.91]I'm throwing the boot at the pterodactyl.
[245:14.07]Now, if this works, and it's a boot, and it's made out of leather, and the pterodactyl eats it, then this is the worst game ever made.
[245:20.72]Let's find out.
[245:28.15]Thank God.
[245:32.46]I still have this cave down here, but I can't... That doesn't do anything.
[245:36.88]I need to light this.
[245:42.16]I need to climb this.
[245:45.70]I'm taking a hint.
[245:47.24]A hint for... 55.
[245:49.08]Hint.

[269:14.24]In 60 minutes.
[269:17.10]Now that could be upside down or that could be right side up.
[269:20.52]I didn't specify that.
