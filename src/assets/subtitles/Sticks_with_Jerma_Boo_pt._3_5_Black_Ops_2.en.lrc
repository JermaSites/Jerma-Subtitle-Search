[00:01.01]Or what map do you like to play?
[00:02.31]Definitely Stanoff.
[00:03.43]Stanoff is my map.
[00:04.53]Stanoff is the map where I do my thing.
[00:06.15]So definitely go ahead and vote Stanoff.
[00:07.95]So what if we do Classified, just to spite you?
[00:10.94]That would make me very sad and kind of question our friendship a bit.
[00:13.96]Are you sure you don't want to join Berg?
[00:18.46]Wait, what are you offering me?
[00:20.08]What is my deal?
[00:22.71]For every video that you upload with the clan tag Berg, the Berg CEO of Berg Industries gives you $5,000.
[00:29.59]$5,000?
[00:29.85]Yeah.
[00:30.09]Now we're talking about the CEO of Berg Associates.
[00:37.92]This is one of the biggest corporations in the world.
[00:41.42]Yeah, I can clearly tell that this is serious stuff.
[00:44.69]But you have to give me time.
[00:45.59]I have to, you know, talk this over with my agent.
[00:47.97]Well, in each upload, I forgot to mention, this is part of the stipulation, in each upload, you have to be completely naked.
[00:54.21]And there has to be a facecam on you.
[00:56.25]No, I'm totally fine with that.
[00:57.45]I'm totally fine with that.
[01:00.36]No, that's not a problem at all.
[01:02.90]No, but I mean, can I do the uploads on livejasmin.com?
[01:06.28]Is that okay?
[01:07.34]No, it has to be on YouTube.
[01:11.86]Well, I mean... You can make, like, separate accounts.
[01:13.86]Yeah.
[01:14.86]I guess I will have to do that.
[01:16.34]Somebody actually has a McDonald's.
[01:20.39]Somebody actually has a... Oh, hello, Boo.
[01:22.35]Somebody actually has a McDonald's logo.
[01:26.73]I find that hilarious.
[01:31.64]Well, Orb is off to a great start here.
[01:33.58]He is going big.
[01:34.76]Going ham.
[01:36.78]I'm in the middle, guys.
[01:37.76]Come fight me.
[01:38.62]I keep forgetting that left click is not like melee.
[01:40.93]I keep trying to left click and I throw a friggin' blazeball.
[01:46.07]How does that make you feel?
[01:47.83]You're getting excited now.
[01:50.66]I am getting very excited.
[01:53.94]You didn't even throw it.
[01:55.44]On my screen I did.
[01:57.14]No, not on my screen.
[01:58.76]You're just holding it for really long.
[02:01.00]Yeah, Sweden ping, bro.
[02:04.34]Okay, so now the ping game starts.
[02:06.56]Yeah, it's like, dude, come on, my ping.
[02:09.45]Dude, totally, dude.
[02:11.61]Oh, I have two tongue-outs.
[02:14.19]My A button on my controller doesn't work.
[02:16.09]Like, I don't know.
[02:17.13]Oh, no.
[02:18.99]You actually invented that excuse back in the day.
[02:32.33]I thought you backed me.
[02:33.01]I thought you backed me first.
[02:34.31]I was close.
[02:37.86]It's so back too because I'm doing the climb maneuver so I can't do anything while I'm climbing.
[02:45.70]Okay, meet me, listen, okay?
[02:47.34]Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock, okay?
[02:50.28]I don't know where the statue is.
[02:51.96]Oh, wait, I'm gonna bank.
[02:53.12]No, what?
[02:53.72]Oh, what was that?
[02:54.72]What?
[02:54.96]What are you gonna do?
[02:55.94]You're gonna bank me?
[02:58.12]Oh, okay, I'm coming for you.
[03:00.02]Oh, there we go.
[03:00.66]There we go.
[03:01.36]I came back.
[03:02.12]I came back.
[03:04.04]Okay, now meet me at the statue.
[03:06.24]Meet me at the statue.
[03:07.60]Oh, oh.
[03:09.37]You said meet me at the statue.
[03:11.23]You didn't say I'm gonna kill you at the statue.
[03:12.85]I'm like, just stay out of here.
[03:15.28]Okay, I'm on the statue.
[03:16.45]Oh!
[03:16.91]GG at the statue.
[03:18.11]That means, like, we're gonna, like, hang out.
[03:19.76]Not you're gonna throw a knife at my head.
[03:23.53]Alright, where are you, Q?
[03:24.31]No!
[03:25.11]Oh, look at that!
[03:25.83]Look at that killcam!
[03:26.71]Look at that killcam!
[03:28.23]What did I just do to you?
[03:29.26]What did I just do to you, Q?
[03:30.32]I came to the statue!
[03:31.48]I'm still trying to be your friend!
[03:32.66]What?
[03:34.32]What are you doing?
[03:35.00]You're the worst... I mean, you're the best opponent ever, I mean.
[03:38.46]Now, you see, when you talk... When you break the friendship trust into the statue, Q, now you get bankrupt.
[03:44.93]What did you expect?
[03:45.73]What did you expect?
[03:46.59]That we were gonna hug and, like, talk... I thought we were gonna, like... Drink hot cocoa.
[03:50.37]You know what?
[03:51.13]Watch this.
[03:51.45]That's what I do with all my friends.
[03:52.43]Watch this!
[03:55.26]Where you yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm right here.
[03:59.94]Oh Somebody somebody was behind you do alright boo.
[04:04.02]I think I was gonna knife you and I have to kill him.
[04:05.51]Oh
[04:06.21]Well, once again, Orb is in the lead here with quite a solid 125 points.
[04:11.68]It looks like another victory here for Orb.
[04:14.36]He is going to try and not really play it cool because he doesn't really believe in it.
[04:19.16]Only Orb will shellcast his own live gameplay about how good he is.
[04:22.45]It took me two games to really get into character, but now I'm here.
[04:25.65]Now I'm ready.
[04:31.33]I'ma slap you with my axe.
[04:33.27]No, I'm sorry, Boo!
[04:35.00]You!
[04:35.88]Yes!
[04:38.68]It's you!
[04:39.12]Okay, come to the statue now.
[04:40.30]Fight me, Jerma.
[04:41.40]And Boo.
[04:41.92]No, no.
[04:42.40]Hey, hey.
[04:43.14]Hey, Boo.
[04:45.54]I didn't mean to.
[04:47.79]I'm by the statue.
[04:48.67]Come here, guys.
[04:49.65]I'm by the statue, guys.
[04:52.13]Where are you guys?
[04:53.86]Me and Boo have a mission right now to come destroy you.
[04:56.98]You're really pre-aiming me?
[04:59.49]Really?
[05:00.93]Okay, I see how it is.
[05:02.99]Let's see how we're gonna play this.
[05:04.65]Oh, shit.
[05:07.83]I'm go- No, no, no.
[05:09.82]I don't have anything.
[05:10.88]No.
[05:11.16]Where is he?
[05:11.80]No.
[05:12.90]No.
[05:14.18]Behind you, what are you doing?
[05:16.10]What are you doing?
[05:17.44]What are you doing?
[05:18.82]I was behind you for the longest time.
[05:20.43]I missed everything.
[05:22.27]Well, 145 points, guys.
[05:23.01]I believe we got... I believe we have another W in the vicinity of this game.
[05:26.73]Well, guys, we've come to that part of the game again where I like to talk.
[05:28.93]And, well...
[05:42.33]145 points on the on the scoreboard here and it's looking like it's got to be another victory here for war he's been playing consistently throughout this tournament and uh he is going to uh to uh you know not really try because it's already really set in stone it's got to be a victory here but he's pretty much just gonna walk around and try to let the opponents bank him here
[06:04.33]NO, MY Jesus Christ!
[06:07.61]Okay, well... Listen, I don't... I don't believe in... It lagged.
[06:13.36]I lagged right there.
[06:14.68]I lagged.
[06:17.46]Nice host.
[06:19.02]I lagged.
[06:21.74]Nice host.
[06:22.88]I lagged, guys.
[06:24.41]Okay.
[06:25.31]Is that... Are you really gonna DDoS me?
[06:27.21]Are you gonna... Are you really gonna DDoS me right now, guys?
[06:30.93]Are you that... Are you that amped to win?
[06:33.25]You're gonna DDoS me?
[06:35.50]See how it is.
[06:36.74]So much for friendship.
