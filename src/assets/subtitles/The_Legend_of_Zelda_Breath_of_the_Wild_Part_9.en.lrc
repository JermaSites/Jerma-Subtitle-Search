[00:28.94]Alright, sorry I ruined the birthday.
[00:31.36]I walked back into the door.
[00:34.90]And I... I didn't forget that this was here, but I kind of did.
[00:38.98]And I... I took down the... I walked into the thing that was hanging.
[00:47.55]Okay.
[00:48.85]So now... That was a ton of fun.
[00:54.29]I'm really surprised I had that much fun on Roblox.
[00:58.50]I thought that was going to be like 20 minutes of just like, oh, whatever, let's just play something or like an hour or something.
[01:04.51]That was really fun.
[01:12.69]Yeah, I walked into the banner.
[01:13.63]I'll show you.
[01:17.22]Um, let me turn my switch on.
[01:24.17]What about Five Nights at Freddy's?
[01:26.15]I think Stuart was just tired and he just was like taking off.
[01:35.44]Because it's... Yeah, we're late night Andes over here.
[01:41.67]That's it.
[01:41.95]We'll do it again.
[01:42.33]We'll do something else later.
[01:43.15]That's fine.
[01:53.48]I want to play that game with Poke too, the scary one.
[02:05.49]Let me make sure I am capturing this correctly.
[02:10.59]On one sec.
[02:18.96]They're making a new FNAF movie.
[02:22.90]Holy shit.
[02:30.14]Yeah, actually, when I was VRB, Holly was like, I thought you were hot-miking.
[02:38.11]No.
[02:41.89]I'm just stupid and had my desktop audio muted.
[02:54.58]Why is my switch not working?
[03:08.61]Is this not even plugged in?
[03:09.73]Oh, shit.
[03:10.23]Hold on.
[03:11.47]Give me one more second.
[03:12.21]I got to unplug the switch for something else.
[04:55.53]Okay.
[04:56.05]Wait, did you not hear when I said I was going to leave?
[04:58.49]Wait, what?
[05:00.55]I said I had to plug my switch in because it was unplugged.
[05:03.75]You didn't hear that?
[05:06.06]Wait, what?
[05:08.06]My audio is not delayed still, is it?
[05:10.78]It shouldn't be.
[05:11.26]That's weird.
[05:13.98]Okay.
[05:26.14]Alright, let me just plug my headphones in.
[05:27.38]You should be able to see it now.
[05:33.68]Or in a second.
[05:37.88]Hey, there it is.
[05:44.70]Let me just plug my actual headphones in.
[06:21.59]Alright, it's time to play.
[06:23.61]What was the last thing I did?
[06:24.45]What did I do last?
[06:28.73]I do need to do this.
[06:34.56]And if I'm going to have any facecam, I need to do this.
[06:37.22]Like this.
[06:41.82]Hold on.
[06:44.74]Oh, you want to see the... Yeah.
[06:45.66]Here, I'll show you.
[06:52.40]Oh, hold on.
[06:52.82]I fucked it up.
[07:01.87]Did I fuck it up?
[07:09.15]Uh, yeah.
[07:09.96]I accidentally walked into it.
[07:12.04]I tore it down.
[07:15.87]I hit my fucking head on the birthday.
[07:18.19]No, I ducked.
[07:18.91]I was ducking down.
[07:20.85]That would mean I was very small.
[07:22.75]Well, it's okay.
[07:29.66]Let me fix this because I need to delay this camera.
[07:40.04]That should do it.
[07:42.70]Alright.
[07:45.00]I am officially ready to play Breath of the Wild.
[07:50.14]Happy... Yeah.
[08:05.03]And get... Rip the decorations down when you fuck a puzzle up.
[08:15.49]Alright, this is the last Divine Feast.
[08:21.09]But I don't want to do that right now.
[08:23.69]I think I want to do... What are some side... There's like the trials, right?
[08:40.08]Should I do those?
[08:47.12]Go get your horse.
[08:47.62]Bottom right.
[08:48.10]Are we going to play Minecraft again?
[09:04.09]There's an island with a really cool side quest down here.
[09:05.91]Let's check it out.
[09:18.89]Ignored?
[09:19.33]What happened?
[09:23.88]What did I ignore?
[09:28.00]Ignore what?
[09:32.06]Oh, the horse.
[09:32.74]That's right.
[09:33.36]I'm imagining it's probably over here.
[09:36.76]Not the horse, but this... Is this the island down here you're talking about?
[09:40.94]Ooh.
[09:41.74]There is an island down... Wait, I was here before.
[09:43.52]Isn't there like a big troll here?
[09:58.10]Is this a stupid thing I'm doing?
[10:15.97]I think I'm gonna make it.
[10:16.67]I think I'll be alright.
[10:28.70]I have stamina drinks.
[10:29.38]Can you finally sing happy birthday?
[10:34.00]Yeah, I said I wasn't, but fine.
[10:36.39]Happy birthday to you.
[10:37.85]Happy birthday to you.
[10:39.41]Happy birthday to whoever you're watching.
[10:42.57]Whoever's watching, right?
[10:43.43]And you distracted me.
[10:44.55]And you probably got me killed.
[11:00.66]How do I get down there?
[11:06.90]Do I just have to make it with stamina?
[11:11.31]I need stamina potions.
[11:13.01]I think I have some, don't I?
[11:21.63]Nah, this is haste.
[11:25.31]Is there any stamina food?
[11:29.38]Need a boat.
[11:30.18]Stamina potions.
[11:31.77]Maybe I can't do it yet.
[11:40.77]Stealth.
[11:42.33]Cook a durian.
[11:49.24]Well, I definitely can't do it yet.
[11:50.44]There's a boat to your left.
[11:55.36]Wait a minute.
[11:58.82]Over there?
[12:08.07]Yeah, I think I remember that.
[12:10.41]Actually, I can make this too, right?
[12:18.30]I can teleport to the shrine.
[12:19.67]What am I doing?
[12:28.22]My mom said you made her day by playing Roblox.
[12:31.13]It was fun.
[12:31.59]That was... That was some of the most fun I've had on stream, I think, in... I don't know.
[12:37.05]It's been like a month or two.
[12:39.01]That was awesome.
[12:39.45]That was just super fun, super funny.
[12:49.20]There we go.
[12:49.82]Oh, wait.
[12:54.13]I need a leaf or something, don't I?
[13:01.60]Isn't that usually like a leaf?
[13:10.93]What's that?
[13:13.19]Cut a tree down?
[13:21.73]Oh, there's it.
[13:22.11]There it is.

[13:27.14]Oh, I'm gonna drop.
[13:28.48]What should I drop?
[13:32.57]I'm dropping this.
[13:33.11]I can get it later.
[13:40.90]Drop the Master Sword?
[13:42.16]That would be awful.
[13:42.88]I'm going to turn that thing back on.

[25:06.44]I'm terrified of this.
[25:30.44]Can I golf it over there?
[25:40.72]Am I going to lose it if I go in here with this?
[25:42.28]I am, aren't I?
[25:54.51]No, wait.
[25:56.11]I won't lose it.
[26:00.09]This is very conflicting.
[26:00.99]I don't know what to do.
[26:02.70]I have an idea.
[26:47.74]Alright, I'm not supposed to do it like this.
[26:51.44]I'm just going to go for it and whatever happens, happens because I just want to test and see if this is even possible.
[26:57.89]Am I going to lose this shit?
[27:01.61]No, this is bad.
[27:02.35]This is a bad idea.
[27:08.23]Is there another spot on the map where one of those is?
[27:15.14]Don't even do that.
[27:22.13]Rebranch.
[27:28.84]I'm so paranoid just to walk over there with it.
[27:36.30]I probably can just walk over there.
[27:38.77]Whatever.
[27:39.63]People are going to laugh at me.
[27:40.39]It's fine.
[27:49.92]Okay, I didn't lose it though.
[27:51.52]I had the right idea.
[27:58.82]I thought it was gonna disappear.
[28:06.71]Yeah, I was just paranoid that it wasn't gonna go away.
[28:08.59]Like it was just gonna disappear.
[28:34.04]Let's go.
[28:34.74]Alright, there's one.
[28:40.77]And what does that do?
[28:41.71]Okay, so I got... I just need to put three in there and I'm good.
[28:54.08]What is happening?
[29:00.69]Thank God I just did that.
[29:02.46]That would have been a disaster.
[29:07.24]Okay.
[29:08.64]There are two more balls on the island.
[29:10.14]Gotta find them.
[29:17.59]That was almost frame perfect.
[29:38.95]I'm going to have to kill that thing, aren't I, eventually?
[29:43.94]I'm going up.
[29:44.40]I know there's another one up there.
[29:45.28]I remember seeing it.
[29:55.67]So the play is just don't aggro the big guy, right?
[30:00.79]That's what I would think.
[30:16.14]OK, oh shit, there's another one.
[30:27.94]Oh.
[30:34.14]It'll get solid.
[30:45.12]Do they notice this?
[30:57.76]Ah!
[31:02.31]Ah!
[31:03.25]How do I move this?
[31:12.05]Ah!
[31:44.15]Wait!
[31:45.77]Does that actually work?
[31:50.04]That's gonna get struck by lightning, right?
[31:51.12]Do I have to have it equipped?
[32:12.06]Alright, how do I give this a strike?
[32:41.21]Oh, come on.
[32:41.89]I don't even know who I'm walking onto.
[32:46.13]Go!
[32:50.33]Come on!
[32:51.25]Where's the flurry?
[33:32.46]You gotta be fucking kidding me, dude.
[33:35.94]Can I stand up here?
[33:36.78]There's a spot right there.
[33:44.10]Come on.
[33:45.85]Nooo!
[33:47.07]Yes!
[33:48.25]Oh, thank god.

[34:11.20]Just do it normally.
[34:32.78]Yes.
[34:33.26]Alright.
[34:34.18]Do I have any food?
[34:35.04]I do.
[34:37.98]I'm just eating them.
[34:46.55]Okay.
[34:48.29]Can I clear it with my lightning move?
[35:01.96]I just killed everything else.
[35:07.09]I wouldn't even close.
[35:07.89]I just killed everything else in the whole map.
[35:11.11]What?
[35:11.37]Ooh, I can cook here.
[35:13.71]Alright, let me clear this.

[45:53.38]What's wrong with him?
[45:54.50]What's he doing?
[45:56.72]What is he doing?
[45:59.72]Everybody fuck off for a second.
[46:01.54]I'm just...
[46:10.25]Just get out of the fucking way!
[46:24.50]Oh!
[46:28.30]That didn't even hurt him.
[46:41.81]I'm like zooming in on his crotch.
[46:54.76]I hit myself with it.
[47:02.70]I'm fine.
[47:03.94]I'm fine.
[47:05.28]I am gonna be just fine.
[47:16.29]I just have to smear this all over his fucking head a few more times.
[47:26.04]Get out of here!
[47:42.02]You fuck off!
[47:42.92]Can I punch you?
[48:01.55]Oh, let's go.
[48:01.97]Oh!
[48:02.03]I got him.
[48:32.22]Stop!
[48:33.38]Stop moving.
[48:34.06]Stop moving.
[48:34.72]Stop moving.
[48:50.08]So close.
[48:56.14]What happened?
[48:56.64]Stop.
[48:56.94]You have... What?
[48:58.60]It's not over?
[48:59.18]What do you mean?
[48:59.82]Wait, what time is it?
[49:05.01]What is it?
[49:05.95]What time is it?
[49:10.07]You're at 30... Oh, I'm at 31 minutes.
[49:19.66]I didn't know that lightning instantly killed him.
[49:22.82]I didn't have it charged either.
[49:23.82]Spawns one of these.
[49:41.63]Cool.
[49:42.93]So now there's a shrine up there.
[49:47.88]Come and enter the shrine.
[49:51.70]You could have just walked up and taken his necklace while he was sleeping.
[49:54.40]Oh.
[49:57.97]Well, that's good to know.
[50:15.71]Is it on my face?
[50:16.45]Oh, I don't know.
[50:18.59]My face is kind of weird.
[50:33.00]It was really close?
[50:33.76]Yeah.
[50:36.04]I should probably cook some food, but I'm not going to.
[50:41.16]That was fun.
[50:49.67]Is there an easy way to get up here?
[50:53.65]It's fine.
[50:55.63]Alright, so what's in here?
[51:13.00]Your eyes are all messed up.
[51:24.99]So many of my teeth.
[51:38.82]Everyone's cyber-bullying him.
[51:40.42]Dude, Roblox was so fun.
[51:45.79]We should definitely do it again.
[52:02.36]300 rupees.
[52:04.86]Okay, I'll take it.
[52:20.87]Oh, also, people started getting their Grotto Beasts.
[52:23.85]We've seen a lot of people writing, like, hey, look what I got, look what I got, look what I got.
[52:28.31]I think a lot of the kits have gone out, so...
[52:32.56]If you have ordered it, keep an eye out.
[52:36.75]I would anticipate it very soon if you ordered in the first week or so of the presale.
[52:42.81]Got mine yesterday.
[52:46.61]Also, the FAQ and the quick start rules should be on the site now.
[52:55.21]They should be there on the bottom of the page.
[52:58.52]Should be like a PDF or something.
[53:04.76]Oh, actually, let me talk about this too.
[53:06.61]So a while back, I talked about the maybe being a digital version.
[53:13.71]So over the last, I want to say a couple of weeks, two or three weeks, we've been really trying to figure out what that meant and what a digital version was going to be.
[53:22.69]So I will tell you right now what we are doing right now, what we're exploring right now.
[53:27.74]And it's currently the thing that we are doing.
[53:32.90]We're gonna do a tabletop simulator mod.
[53:35.34]A free mod.
[53:37.02]That... There's a person here.
[53:41.16]Is gonna have all 200 cards available.
[53:44.88]And the idea was to make it so... So the actual experience is not gonna be like card pack pay openings or anything.
[53:54.06]It's not like, oh yeah, let's buy more card packs digitally.
[53:59.16]we understand that there's a lot of people that want to play with other people but just don't really have any way to do that because there is a game right there's a game on top of it so the game designer and we're going to get some um other people like uh the uh the core art team and uh maybe a 3D designer is going to come in and we're going to make a whole experience in tabletop simulator
[54:23.04]just tons of little toys and it's gonna be a whole experience it's not just gonna be here's a wooden desk with all 200 cards good luck uh they're gonna debit out so if you don't have tabletop simulator that's I mean that I think that it goes on sale a lot doesn't it I think it's pretty cheap too it's not I think it's only like what 10 15 bucks 20 bucks yeah very often
[54:56.58]But it also gives an opportunity for the, so the game designer is going to be kind of curating that space on top of the art team.
[55:04.21]So it's just going to be free.
[55:06.29]You can have fun, play with it, play with your friends.
[55:09.75]That's kind of the idea.
[55:14.06]I'm seeking adventure.
[55:16.42]You and I have that in common.
[55:17.30]It is only from here that I can probably hear the wind.
[55:25.12]I want to live as the wind does, free and unrestricted.
[55:27.04]To bide here and listen to its voice offers a taste of that freedom.
[55:31.37]Don't you long to be like the wind too?
[55:33.11]Didn't really occur to me.
[55:40.47]We can read the messages ourselves.
[55:42.28]These?
[55:45.02]You don't want me to read them to you?
[55:46.06]Okay.
[55:53.23]Is there anything else to do with this person?
[55:55.10]Have you returned a train to become the wind?
[55:58.86]Okay.
[56:01.52]20 rupees.
[56:02.02]Alright, let's go.
[56:04.94]Wait here while I prepare the course.
[56:07.04]Obstacle course?
[56:07.54]Okay.
[56:17.02]Okay.
[56:22.28]So I gotta fly through these?
[56:25.35]Gotta go faster than this.
[56:52.92]Goku?
[56:59.71]No.
[57:00.07]All the way up?
[57:04.41]Oh, over here.
[57:11.27]Whoops.
[57:12.15]Wait, go down.
[57:15.23]Oh!
[57:16.01]I'm gonna... I gotta go.
[57:18.49]Wait, what happened?
[57:20.03]Why do I have no stamina?
[57:21.73]Am I gonna fall?
[57:22.73]Wait.
[57:24.45]Why did I run out of stamina?
[57:28.18]Do I not have enough stamina to do it?
[57:29.14]I need to eat stamina food.
[57:41.58]23 rings.
[57:51.67]He gave me my money back.
[57:56.15]You know what?
[57:56.47]Here, take it back.
[57:57.16]Let's do it again.
[58:01.90]Release the glider when you're descending.
[58:03.54]Oh, that's true.
[58:04.96]Alright, let's go.
[58:24.52]Do I have an opportunity to release it, though?
[58:27.24]How did I not go through it?
[58:53.76]Oh, shit.
[58:55.37]Alright, I got it.
[58:58.49]That's a tricky one.
[59:08.03]Hmm.
[59:12.26]Let go in the middle.
[59:14.36]And then press it again.
[59:15.04]No, I want to do it again.
[59:19.14]Yeah.
[59:21.08]Ah.
[59:26.91]You gonna beat the game tonight?
[59:27.99]No, no.
[59:28.45]I'm just gonna do some side stuff.
[59:32.75]Eat stamina food.
[59:33.55]I don't have any.
[59:34.17]I'm gonna have to come back here when I do.
[59:56.69]I went through it.
[59:58.09]You saw me do that.
[59:59.11]I went right through the middle.
[60:02.00]What the fuck just happened?
[60:34.33]Whatever, I got 25.
[60:34.79]Okay, I made money.
[60:52.08]I want it again.
[60:55.94]That's the end of the course, right?
[60:57.44]Is that the end?
[61:03.49]Oh, it's not.
[61:08.45]Clip!
[62:02.56]Did you actually play Roblox?
[62:05.23]Uh, yeah.
[62:06.33]V-Poke and Ster.
[62:08.84]It was a ton of fun.
[62:10.04]Poke is fucking hilarious too.
[62:14.56]So Ster.
[62:17.22]The vibe of that group was really fun.
[62:19.78]Let me go this way.
[62:33.67]Alright, I got a lot more air this time.
[62:43.97]Alright, much better.
[62:45.83]Come on, dude.

[63:59.51]31, the biggest one?
[64:03.53]Alright, let's go.
[64:24.04]That was risky, but I did it.
[64:36.13]Don't even fucking think about it!
[64:44.56]Don't strike me with lightning, please!
[64:51.07]That was going so well, too.
[64:52.61]That was going so well.
[64:57.57]That was like the best.
[64:58.37]I probably was going to 100% that.
[65:12.56]That was going so good, too.
[65:14.16]Take off the armor?
[65:14.80]Alright.
[65:28.79]I'm dead.
[65:29.33]Okay, I don't have any gear on anymore.
[65:42.19]I shouldn't get struck by lightning.
[65:52.76]Can I get a bunch of bananas or something?
[65:58.24]Alright, let's go.
[65:58.66]Hmm.
[65:58.78]I think I screwed it up.
[66:33.71]I think I'm alright.
[66:37.84]No.
[66:38.76]No, the first one was so much better.
[66:49.68]What is happening with that shit?
[66:52.95]Why do I go through, but it doesn't count?
[66:55.37]Like, what's going on?
[66:56.45]I just went through it three times.
[67:04.86]I have to do it.
[67:05.48]Why do I keep doing this with my mouth?
[67:24.99]Like this?
[67:29.99]Hmm.
[67:34.10]had at that time did I get struck by lightning alright last try and that's it no matter what oh
[68:08.17]I tried to get too flashy with it.
[68:09.53]No, just try it.
[68:10.29]No, no, no.
[68:10.79]Just try again.
[68:11.25]Try again.
[68:11.61]I was being flashy.
[68:12.89]I was blind.
[68:13.25]Ugh.
[68:13.63]I was trying to be so flashy.
[68:16.61]That was stupid.
[68:25.18]Aww.
[68:28.40]Alright, this is actually the last one no matter what.
[68:35.67]Ah.
[68:44.25]Let's go.
[69:03.92]Go, come on.
[69:10.60]What are you talking?
[69:11.90]What happened?
[69:40.52]I'm giving all the money back that I just won.
[69:42.38]I left out my... Just go.
[69:52.25]I need to get the money back.
[69:58.29]I was gonna say, I love how my, like, knees can go through, but if my head goes through, it doesn't count.
[70:07.95]Why am I losing so much momentum now?
[70:11.83]Why can I not do it anymore?
[70:12.83]I don't get it.
[70:16.69]I've done this, like, ten times.
[70:17.83]These last three times, I've just fallen on the ground.
[70:24.32]Aww.
[70:32.81]Alright, this is the last one.
[70:57.31]Shit.
[70:57.85]It's alright.
[71:01.47]It's okay.
[71:01.71]I think I'm fine.
[71:06.52]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[71:17.94]What part of your body has to go through the rings?
[71:19.34]Because sometimes my knees go through and it doesn't work.
[71:21.10]Sometimes my head goes through and it does.
[71:27.54]The middle of my body has to go through.
[71:33.90]Oh.
[71:35.92]Why does this keep screwing up?
[71:36.93]I've done this like 15 times now.
[71:40.22]I'm doing it the exact way I did it before.
[72:09.96]GAH!
[72:11.70]Oh my god.
[72:14.04]Just go, just go, just go.
[72:36.40]Dude, I can do that.

[72:39.86]I know I can do that.
[72:52.67]Alright, I made all my money back.
[72:57.07]We're good.
[72:57.43]I can do it again.
[72:58.13]I made it all back.
[73:02.32]We're good.
[73:02.62]Everything's fine.
[73:07.00]Oh, you guys are betting on these.
[73:08.18]I think I'm going too quick for you to bet.
[73:12.32]Alright, this is actually going to be the one for real.
[73:14.71]No more messing around.
[73:53.60]WHAT are you talking about?
[73:57.08]Why is this so finicky?
[73:58.96]I wha- how- WHAT?!
[73:59.96]Are you crazy?!
[74:00.62]WHAT?! !
[74:26.69]I'm making money, but what the hell?
[74:33.48]How can I get the first one and not the second one?
[74:36.44]I just got the first one.
[74:37.56]It's a fucking air vent.
[75:09.69]BEEP
[75:47.71]Yes!
[75:49.47]There it is.
[75:49.87]I got it.
[75:51.81]What happened?
[75:54.19]Oh no, people are still betting.
[76:16.42]Oh, I only get 100?
[76:19.69]Oh, I thought I was going to get something more.
[76:25.18]Well, I left it with like 300 extra dollars.
[76:27.40]That's cool.
[76:38.45]I missed one?
[76:40.05]No, don't tell me that.
[76:41.31]I'm not going to do it anymore.
[76:44.57]Alright, where should I go from here?
[76:46.68]That was cool.
[76:47.60]I can remove this.
[76:55.79]It's 35, not 34.
[76:56.59]Eh, it's alright.
[77:05.54]I want... Can I upgrade my gear?
[77:10.54]Where was that?
[77:11.08]It's like over here, isn't it?
[77:23.65]Upgrade the Master Sword?
[77:31.94]50 plus is the top reward?
[77:33.09]How would you even do that?
[77:42.67]Where's the... Where's the Kakariko?
[77:46.29]Whatever it is.
[77:56.84]Stamina upgrade?
[77:59.12]Southeast.
[78:07.53]Where is it?
[78:09.33]Hyrule Field.
[78:10.05]It's east.
[78:19.55]Oh, it's right here.
[78:22.69]Isn't it?
[78:23.17]Where is it?
[78:23.47]Right here?
[78:25.43]Where's the upgrade person?
[78:26.25]I want to upgrade.
[78:39.25]It's marked with a leaf.
[78:43.73]Cool.
[78:52.86]Isn't this where I have to... It's a big forest, big bunch of trees and shit, and I have to go... Like, this way, right?
[79:01.35]Yeah, right here.
[79:15.65]What's that?
[79:20.15]Is that something cool?
[79:21.23]I don't even know if I have any ingredients to do this.
[79:39.23]Find out.
[79:46.37]I probably do.
[79:46.88]It's been like six to ten in-game hours.
[79:59.67]I can do this.
[80:00.43]I mean, might as well.
[80:14.38]Put your clothes back on?
[80:15.98]Wait, can you not?
[80:18.80]I can do it with my clothes on?
[80:27.10]I think it just said I couldn't really do anything.
[80:28.96]I don't think it's worth it.
[80:38.79]Yeah, no, it didn't have to be on.
[80:41.45]Uh, nah.
[80:43.77]I want this one.
[80:44.63]I like this stuff.
[80:49.08]Swim speed is cool, but I think I already did that area.
[80:51.20]I feel like I really need it.
[80:55.56]Although those horns, I feel like I have a lot of those.
[80:57.68]I don't know how rare those horns are.
[81:00.84]Go find another fairy.
[81:05.58]Four upgrades per piece.
[81:06.86]Okay.
[81:09.50]Doesn't cost, like, nothing.
[81:17.12]There's other fairy fountains.
[81:18.80]Oh, okay.
[81:23.89]I'll just do it.
[81:24.61]Why not?
[81:25.89]Hmm.
[81:46.53]Set bonuses I have.
[81:57.30]So I said follow the path behind this area.
[82:00.94]Follow the path and there's something to do.
[82:06.06]I'll check it out.
[82:25.96]Cool.
[82:26.74]Okay.
[82:27.40]Follow the path.
[82:32.58]Uh... Like, the actual path path?
[82:37.77]Like, the road?
[82:39.03]Or is there some, like, secret over here I haven't seen?
[82:46.82]When's your bedtime?
[82:49.92]Um, maybe a little bit.
[82:51.76]It's northeast.
[82:56.82]Like over here?
[83:02.32]Do I have to climb out of here?
[83:22.58]uh am I going am I going the right way path does not mean climb I mean I feel like I'm at the end of the forest here in the northern section just kind of stay I mean you mean like over here
[83:52.01]I think this is it.
[84:17.83]Birthday raid song?
[84:28.40]I don't have any weapons equipped.
[84:29.61]That's kind of bad.
[84:41.11]Who's my horse?
[84:41.69]Um... I don't know.
[84:45.81]I never seem to have the horse.
[84:51.26]About a year ago, I was walking along the road here at night when I suddenly saw a blinding light in the sky.
[84:55.58]When my eyes finally adjusted, I found myself looking at a shimmering object floating overhead.
[84:58.56]I couldn't look away.
[85:00.34]I was bathed in light when I came to.
[85:01.74]I woke up in bed covered in sweat.
[85:06.53]What do you think about that?
[85:07.71]That sounds like a dream.
[85:08.43]Okay.
[85:14.64]Bed full of liquid in an empty room.
[85:16.54]And when I looked in the corner, there was a weird glowing device.
[85:20.22]When I touched the device, I was overwhelmed with a feeling of familiarity.
[85:24.18]When I came to, I was here.
[85:25.08]What do you think about that?
[85:27.22]Does that sound familiar?
[85:29.84]Hylian Champion from Master Koga.
[85:33.70]I ain't dying here.
[86:06.30]Got ya.
[86:08.79]Ooh.
[86:11.95]Demon Carver.
[86:12.81]Alright.
[86:13.31]What can I drop?
[86:13.89]That's not what I wanted.
[86:24.78]Okay.
[86:28.28]So, left or right here?
[86:29.24]I'm going to say right.
[86:30.74]Right looks kind of interesting.
[86:33.42]Keep the leaf.
[86:34.10]Keep the leaf, please.
[86:41.95]Keep the leaf.
[86:47.55]That's a lot of damage.
[86:48.29]In exchange for what?
[86:53.18]I don't have to drop.
[86:54.40]You don't need the leaf.
[86:55.71]Oh, people are trolling.
[86:56.49]Okay.
[87:02.81]Yeah, there's a million trees in this world.
[87:05.33]I'll find another one.
[87:23.33]Interesting.
[87:23.87]Okay.
[87:24.11]Do you think you could beat Ganon with a leaf?
[87:38.99]Probably not.
[87:40.73]I highly doubt that.
[88:05.77]Shit.
[88:18.19]How do you break these without blowing them up?
[88:25.39]Do I have to blow these up with the magnet?
[88:31.40]Just by smashing them?
[88:51.07]Nice.
[88:51.27]I got a lot of money.
[88:52.77]I could probably buy something nice.
[88:55.91]Okay, cool.
[89:18.40]You need a big two-hander to break him?
[89:24.16]I mean, this is effective and doesn't really... Do it a couple times.
[89:55.03]That did not hit me.
[90:00.71]Master sword's... Where's the master sword?
[90:16.08]I mean, it recharges in time.
[90:17.56]Yeah, how come it's not on the menu though?
[90:20.58]That's kind of freaking me out.
[90:36.33]Yes, that's it.
[90:40.95]That's very good.
[90:48.24]Ooh.
[90:52.00]Down here.
[90:52.84]Oh, that's why everybody wanted me to get a leaf.
[90:58.10]Now I understand.
[91:07.94]Yeah, I can swim in this.
[91:09.06]That's not a problem.
[91:12.75]It's not even deep.
[91:17.75]Where's the actual... Hold on.
[91:24.18]Underwater?
[91:29.02]Underwater.
[91:44.06]alright get up get on the thing what are you doing hey nice
[92:26.99]As long as I don't dash, I think I can wait on my swim.
[92:30.50]I just upgraded it.
[92:41.25]How come you're not listening to us?
[92:45.55]I'm going to find the waterfall, right?
[93:06.82]Swim upwards.
[93:07.36]SWIM UPWARDS QUICK!
[93:08.18]I don't even know what just happened.
[93:38.15]Alright, what's wrong?
[93:50.58]That's a very good idea.
[93:52.50]I think I'll do it.
[93:59.19]How do I get under there though?
[94:22.49]private oh yep
[94:44.21]What is in here?
[94:44.77]This looks pretty expensive, whatever it is.
[94:52.68]Soldier's broadsword.
[94:53.84]Should I get rid of this?
[95:02.89]This thing is 60 damage.
[95:04.81]That's ridiculous.
[95:09.90]Not worth it.
[95:11.50]It's terrible.
[95:12.12]Got extra durability, though.
[95:19.87]Not worth it.
[95:21.11]Yeah.
[95:44.71]Okay, so now what's the deal here?
[95:48.22]Should I just swim up?
[95:52.64]How do I get down?
[95:56.63]Swim under?
[95:57.23]I don't think there is like a dive, right?
[96:05.50]Swim through.
[96:06.04]It's behind it.
[96:14.06]Oh, okay.
[96:18.52]So now what?
[96:29.23]Uh, where am I?
[96:33.11]Look up?
[96:36.17]I'm gonna fucking die.
[96:36.93]Hold on.
[96:39.25]What?
[96:39.75]No.
[96:39.95]Dude, stop.
[96:40.71]Just let...
[96:44.42]You're killing me here.
[96:58.71]I can't go down.
[96:59.53]Do you say it was underwater or is it up above here?
[97:13.04]It's not down.
[97:14.14]Oh, I thought people tell me to dive down.
[97:24.69]Cat is dumb.
[97:25.33]It's behind the waterfall.
[97:29.07]What?
[97:42.69]What the hell is up here?
[97:43.79]Am I moving OK?
[98:03.37]I thought it was under.
[98:03.93]I thought it was down like in the under the water or something.
[98:05.99]OK, this makes way more sense.
[98:18.24]I saw, like, the reflection in the water.
[98:20.22]I thought it was, like, down in the water.
[98:22.04]That shit wouldn't even reflect that far.
[98:28.89]Unrealistic.
[98:29.43]Alright, what is this?
[98:48.59]I don't think we're doing any coding or betting.
[98:50.59]Alright, chest.
[99:03.66]You're going to turn emote only on though and you're going to kill me.
[99:09.98]You're going to get me killed because I can't see the chat and they can't help me.
[99:19.83]Alright.
[99:26.40]Big button.
[99:29.22]Big button can't... Ooh, okay, hold on.
[99:36.24]What does this big button need?
[99:37.84]Can I put, like, a chest on it?
[99:41.84]Okay.
[99:44.16]I think it's just a weight thing.
[99:55.42]Is it a wait thing?
[100:04.66]It's gotta be it, right?
[100:22.68]Yep.
[100:27.17]OK.
[100:34.33]That's enough weight.
[100:51.38]OK, this goes over here.
[100:58.72]And then I climb that.
[100:59.76]Wait, let me get the items first.
[101:00.72]This is not going to mess with the weight, is it?
[101:06.13]I hope not.
[101:10.15]Zora sword.
[101:10.79]I don't know if that's any better than what I have.
[101:23.55]Sorcerer, meh.
[101:26.91]14 damage.
[101:28.60]That's really not that much.
[101:43.69]Hmm, how do I?
[101:44.63]Oh, like this.
[101:52.10]That's it.
[101:54.26]Well, I hit the wrong button.
[102:15.29]Do I have four?
[102:15.87]I feel like I need way more stamina.
[102:21.15]How many do I have?
[102:23.88]two you can't see it but it's two nice very cool what else is down here anything else I should do probably
[102:58.20]Can you just do a shrine normally?
[102:59.96]Yeah.
[103:03.80]There's a memory down here apparently.
[103:05.56]Okay.
[103:05.78]Hold on.
[103:08.72]Let me get this.
[103:20.01]Ooh, wait.
[103:20.53]What's this?
[103:41.70]Are you more like Zelda or Link?
[103:44.48]What's that little, what's that little weird guy?
[103:47.80]He like does confetti and like flies around.
[103:50.78]What's his name?
[103:54.68]Tingle.
[103:55.36]Yeah.
[104:09.35]I wonder if I should just keep going that way.
[104:11.35]But, I'm intrigued.
[104:23.26]Vinny also said he's like Tingle.
[104:26.34]Wow, Vinny.
[104:28.52]Vinny's a smart fucking guy.
[104:29.76]Okay.
[104:43.99]Get away from me.
[104:47.99]I'm going across this bridge.
[104:50.69]I'm not going to fight these.
[104:51.69]Why would I?
[104:55.67]You can't both be tingled.
[105:00.87]Who can I be?
[105:12.06]Ganon?
[105:13.50]No, no way.
[105:15.54]I'm way too lazy to be Ganon.
[105:23.92]The prospect of taking over the entire universe.
[105:27.11]Like, oh, yeah, alright.
[105:28.69]The whole fucking universe.
[105:29.97]Let's, uh, I kind of just want to watch The Office on Netflix.
[105:32.85]Never mind.
[105:34.25]That was a, eh, I don't care.
[105:44.91]Check your iPad.
[105:51.22]Memories.
[106:08.55]Found it.
[106:23.50]Oh, that's right.
[106:24.28]Okay.
[106:54.00]Let's see.
[106:54.32]So you didn't feel anything?
[106:59.74]No power at all?
[107:01.10]I'm sorry, no.
[107:01.70]Then let's move on.
[107:22.73]One second, I felt like I was still in Roblox.
[107:25.60]Feeling sorry for yourself won't be of any help.
[107:28.84]After all, it's not like your last shot was up there on Mount Lanayru.
[107:32.86]Anything could finally spark the power to seal Ganon away.
[107:36.26]We just have to keep looking for that thing.
[107:42.60]That's kind of you.
[107:47.10]I'm actually quite embarrassed to say it.
[107:57.65]But I was thinking about what I do when I'm healing.
[108:01.47]You know, what usually goes through my mind.
[108:05.22]It helps when I think about...
[108:32.62]I was here.
[108:34.20]This is it, then.
[108:35.34]Are you sure?
[108:37.08]Positive.
[108:38.34]It's awake.
[108:40.83]Ganon.
[108:46.31]Let's stop wasting time.
[108:48.11]We're gonna need everything we got to take that thing down.
[108:51.87]Now, champions!
[108:53.24]To your divine beasts!
[108:55.10]Show that swirling swine who's boss!
[108:57.80]Link will need to meet Ganon head-on when we attack.
[109:00.18]This needs to be a unified assault.
[109:03.22]Little guy, you get-get to Hyrule Castle.
[109:07.59]You can count on us for support, but it's up to you to pound Ganon into oblivion.
[109:14.41]Come.
[109:15.11]We should go.
[109:16.49]We need to get you someplace safe.
[109:20.87]No, I'm not a child anymore.
[109:23.67]I didn't.
[109:24.05]I'm sorry.
[109:24.45]There must be something I can do to help.
[109:25.93]I dragged it over.
[109:50.93]Because I have to be on a different input on my monitor.
[109:56.91]And I can't see what's actually on my desktop behind the screen.
[110:02.85]That was cool.
[110:05.09]That was a dramatic moment.
[110:07.13]It was fine.
[110:13.55]There.
[110:14.15]We'll We'll go facecam off.
[110:18.13]Live tingle reaction.
[110:20.19]Alright, cool.
[110:35.10]Let's do it.
[110:40.52]Oh, it's one of these guys.
[110:42.40]Alright.
[110:44.56]Okay.
[110:50.23]Oops.
[111:00.03]Where is...
[111:22.35]Stop!
[111:23.33]For one second!
[111:24.35]I can't... What's going on?
[111:27.20]What are you doing?
[111:48.44]The blood moon rises once again.
[112:12.83]I don't even know what direction he is swinging that.
[112:15.19]Is it vertical or horizontal?
[112:17.43]I need a shield.
[112:31.70]Oh, right.
[112:32.18]I unequipped my shield.
[112:33.58]There's a stupid lightning dog shit.
[112:36.46]And now I can can't parry this dog shit.
[112:39.88]Okay.
[112:57.91]Oh my god, you have a lot of health.
[112:59.03]Don't!
[113:25.92]I need a weapon.
[113:27.18]Put a weapon on.
[113:28.18]What's going on?
[113:29.08]Oh my goodness gracious.
[113:34.66]What can I even eat?
[113:48.84]I have to eat all this stuff.
[113:50.20]I have to.
[113:51.74]Eat it all.
[113:52.18]Just eat everything.
[113:52.76]It doesn't matter.
[114:06.64]oh you do that more than a few times oh that wasn't a swing I think I'm dead here oh I'm in so much trouble
[114:53.48]Oh, missed it.
[114:54.24]One more hit.
[114:55.12]Yeah!
[114:55.98]Very nice.
[114:57.62]What do I get?
[115:23.33]Sword.
[115:23.77]The mighty Lynel Bow.
[115:30.22]Well, I absolutely am getting rid of something.
[115:31.86]Holy shit.
[115:34.08]Alright, awesome.
[115:34.80]What should I get rid of?
[115:36.70]Golden Bow?
[115:37.16]I feel like this is the worst out of all of them.
[115:50.38]Golden Bow.
[115:51.54]Another Lynel Shield.
[115:57.91]What is better?
[115:58.45]A Night Shield or a Lynel Shield?
[116:01.05]Probably the Night Shield, yeah.
[116:15.18]Lynel Shield does damage when you parry.
[116:25.43]That one's about to break.
[116:27.10]Yeah, this one's new though, isn't it?
[116:30.80]Drop the old Lionel shield.
[116:34.18]Actually, good idea.
[116:35.98]But how much have I used it?
[116:55.33]I have used that a lot.
[116:58.53]Sparkle means new.
[117:10.02]Go back to Impa.
[117:13.58]Is that all I can do here?
[117:18.04]I think that was part of it, right?
[117:27.03]Keep going up the mountain.
[117:29.97]It's kind of chilly here.
[117:36.69]Wait, even with your current?
[117:37.70]I don't think I have anything, do I?
[117:55.78]Flame sword?
[117:57.60]Is that enough, though?
[118:04.30]No.
[118:04.52]I don't think I can do this.
[118:17.42]I need special armor.
[118:18.30]That's what I figured.
[118:19.04]Alright.
[118:19.40]Sweet.
[118:25.55]Imagine there's something up here.
[118:27.85]There is, eventually.
[118:29.17]Uh, where's Impa?
[118:39.38]Somebody said go talk to Impa now.
[118:48.79]Mark it.
[118:49.65]Uh, I'm gonna mark...
[118:54.64]I don't want to mark this spot right here, because I'll be confused how to get there.
[118:57.00]How did I get up here?
[118:58.04]It was kind of... It was through the waterfall.
[119:01.50]Alright, I'll mark it just to... Uh, the leaf.
[119:12.60]Okay.
[119:14.30]Oh, shit.
[119:28.00]I don't know if that was a question.
[119:48.33]Let's turn it in.
[120:03.58]What do you got for me?
[120:08.62]Kimpa uses a neti pot, do you?
[120:12.18]I've used it before, but... Not in a while.
[120:15.22]Kind of feels weird.
[120:29.15]Okay.
[120:29.41]Okay.
[120:41.16]I'll hand this over to you now before I forget.
[120:43.78]Champion's tunic.
[120:47.62]In ancient Hyrule, this garment could only be worn by one who had earned the respect of the royal family.
[120:51.74]Equipment will reveal an enemy's life gauge.
[120:54.20]Ooh.
[120:55.09]Wait.
[120:55.55]Don't I already have that?
[120:59.15]Doesn't it already show people's health bars?
[121:12.98]Exact values.
[121:14.50]Oh.
[121:18.16]Wait, is it telling me to go kill the divine beasts?
[121:30.14]I already got three down.
[121:33.82]Let me see that thing.
[121:34.44]Five.
[121:45.23]Oh, cool.
[121:51.08]So if I upgrade this, it's already going to be... Alright, that's cool.
[121:54.70]Do I have enough materials to upgrade it?
[122:09.19]I don't think I do.
[122:15.08]Be careful.
[122:17.18]You're dressed like a dork right now.
[122:18.68]I think I look pretty cool.
[122:27.07]When it's fully upgraded, it's one of the strongest in the game.
[122:28.89]Well, alright.
[122:29.51]I'll keep it for sure.
[122:30.11]Alright.
[122:34.31]I think that's probably a good place to call it.
[122:38.42]I think this is a good time.
[122:39.92]1115.
[122:40.00]Five hours and some change.
[122:46.82]I gotta get some food, too.
[122:47.58]It was a really fun night, though.
[122:52.05]I had a great time.
[122:54.61]I feel like the vibes were on, um, tonight, so.
[122:59.35]It was a good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good night.
[123:08.67]Do the DLC.
[123:17.22]Uh, yeah, I... I'm just going to play it.
[123:21.34]I'll play it just to turn it on.
[123:25.88]And I got really nothing else going on.
[123:30.85]I think the next thing I really want to do... I did that.
[123:38.17]I want to at least get this area uncovered.
[123:41.53]Uncovered?
[123:47.59]Because I want the whole map sort of revealed at this point.
[123:50.21]At least from here.
[124:02.29]Baron is really cool.
[124:03.62]Cool.
[124:03.74]When are you going to do no-cam chill streams?
[124:08.64]Yeah, I feel like they've been a little crazy recently, but there's been a lot going on.
[124:17.62]We'll slow it down a little bit.
[124:18.58]I said that last week, but... I mean it this time.
[124:24.35]We're gonna... Pull the... I'm gonna put the brakes on.
[124:35.75]Yeah, I mean, next stream... I don't know if I'm gonna play Breath of the Wild next.
[124:38.74]Maybe I will.
[124:40.82]Let's say... Friday?
[124:43.62]Okay.
[124:44.87]Oh, also, something else I really want to do.
[124:47.99]I want to do another, like, 80s and 90s commercial watch stream.
[124:52.37]I feel like people really enjoyed that.
[124:53.67]I thought that was really fun.
[124:57.63]I think we'll probably do that at some point, too.
[125:01.37]People have been asking for that again, and I've just kind of been like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[125:06.23]Maybe we'll do that, I don't know, at some point this weekend, maybe a little bit after this weekend.
[125:11.02]I'll get it set up.
[125:17.15]Resident Evil 4 Mercenaries launches tomorrow.
[125:18.99]Ooh, maybe we'll do that on Friday.
[125:28.16]Yeah, I still have to watch Ster play Five Nights at Freddy's.
[125:34.16]But I think we played Roblox for like three hours.
[125:37.21]And I think, I don't know if we anticipated we were going to do that.
[125:46.87]But yeah, there's a couple games that me and Ster are going to play at some point too.
[125:50.92]The next week, probably.
[126:01.41]More Roblox.
[126:04.65]I... Roblox is like the kind of game that I kind of like.
[126:12.20]It's just, you can just jump in a game and who cares?
[126:15.38]It doesn't even matter.
[126:16.23]30 minutes can go by and you can just leave.
[126:19.73]Or you can play for like two hours.
[126:25.21]There's no shame.
[126:34.74]No, that was great.
[126:35.58]Thanks again.
[126:36.40]Big thanks to Poke and obviously Stirr.
[126:39.75]Vibes were immaculate tonight.
[126:41.47]It was really fun, really funny.
[126:46.81]And I'll see you guys on Friday.
[127:00.16]I don't know exactly what we'll do on Friday.
[127:02.22]Anticipate either Resident Evil 4 Mercenaries, maybe Breath of the Wild, maybe, you know, maybe I might just turn on something random.
[127:09.60]Just play it.
[127:10.58]We'll see.
[127:12.81]Friday's stream is going to be slowed down.
[127:14.77]We're going to chill out.
[127:16.79]And then at some point, maybe this weekend, we'll do the 80s and 90s ads.
[127:24.86]Let's see if I can get it set up.
[127:26.70]I'll let you know.
[127:41.55]Yeah, Hylics too.
[127:43.27]Definitely do that.
[128:01.19]Okay, sorry, I'm typing to somebody.
[128:04.25]Can we submit videos?
[128:05.89]Um... No, I have a lot of compilations that we didn't even see.
[128:12.37]So if I ever get to a point where.
[128:13.63]I need more, which I don't know how often I do this kind of stuff, so.
[128:21.77]I don't know if I do it at the frequency to need to have a bunch of submissions or something, because still a lot that I have we have not even looked at.
[128:37.45]There's the music.
[128:38.17]Oh shit, sorry.
[128:42.44]Oh, well, it's... We're at the end anyways.
[128:48.64]Vinny might have some good playlists, especially for terrible video game ads.
[128:55.50]Yeah, I'll be talking to him soon anyways.
[128:57.34]Maybe I'll see if he's got any good ones.
[129:05.73]But yeah.
