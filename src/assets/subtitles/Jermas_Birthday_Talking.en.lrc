[01:47.47]What kind of fucking moron are you, Windows?
[01:49.97]What did you do?
[01:51.43]What- What have you done?
[01:53.92]What have you done?
[01:54.96]It doesn't even know my- It doesn't even know- It doesn't even recognize my other monitor now.
[02:02.36]I- I don't have a- I don't have a monitor anymore.
[02:06.20]Oh my fucking god.
[02:07.38]Yeah, I don't have a second.

[02:20.64]Happy birthday.
[02:21.80]I'm 32.
[02:22.02]I should be angry at this.
[02:35.65]Why?
[02:35.93]Why?
[02:36.23]I don't... Do I have to like unplug this fucking thing and plug it back in?
[02:45.41]Hold on a minute.
[02:50.53]What the fuck?
[02:56.82]I fucking hate computers.
[02:59.68]Technology sucks.
[03:01.98]Everybody just keeps fucking it up.
[03:04.71]You know what I'm saying?
[03:05.33]Everybody keeps fucking up technology.
[03:07.63]Nobody gets it right.
[03:08.59]They always just keep shitting on it.
[03:10.07]I can't even plug the fucking thing back in.
[03:25.44]Get out of my fucking way.
[03:27.10]Get out of my way thing.
[03:28.38]Like, oh my god.

[04:21.64]Am I afraid?
[04:23.48]No.
[04:34.77]This is not making it fucking easier.
[04:36.29]I updated my windows and I don't have another computer.
[04:40.05]I don't have another fucking computer screen.
[04:55.40]Alright, shut up.
[04:56.35]Shut this fucking shit off for a minute.
[04:58.81]Turn this off for a minute.
[05:02.09]I need to figure out why my fucking computer doesn't work.
[05:07.05]We'll turn that back on in a moment.
[05:08.82]I gotta go through the money and shit.
[05:10.76]This is so stupid.
[05:15.86]I don't have a... I told you, everything I fucking touch breaks.
[05:20.97]Everything.
[05:21.47]No matter what it is.
[05:25.25]It doesn't matter what it is.
[05:25.99]It doesn't matter what the scenario is.
[05:33.91]What?
[05:39.08]This monitor apparently is broken.
[05:43.22]The stupid fucking Windows update broke this monitor.
[05:45.76]It doesn't even work.
[05:46.78]I'm looking over on this fucking thing.
[05:48.13]Look at this.
[05:49.89]Like, this is the shit I'm looking at.
[05:55.01]Somebody explain this to me.
[05:56.54]I'm going to show this.
[05:59.48]What is that?
[06:03.20]That's my monitor?
[06:04.10]Okay.
[06:05.88]What is going on here?
[06:07.62]Show only on two.
[06:08.82]Extend these displays.
[06:10.80]Sorry.
[06:11.48]Keep this?
[06:15.61]What on Earth are you doing?
[06:18.37]This is not monitor one.
[06:19.63]Very clearly.
[06:31.02]Is the other monitor on?
[06:32.01]Yeah, I was just using it.
[06:35.85]The same thing happened to you?
[06:39.89]Ayayay.
[06:40.83]Like, ayayay.
[06:42.09]That's all I can say is ayayay.
[06:43.76]There's been like fucking five or six ayayays tonight.
[06:46.20]It's my birthday.
[06:48.50]I just turned 22.
[06:54.75]Unplug and rip.
[06:55.35]I just did that.
[06:55.99]I ripped out the cord and I plugged it back in.
[07:00.04]I'm going to have to restart the computer eventually or something.
[07:02.48]I have to restart Windows.
[07:14.59]That means I have to turn the stream off.
[07:16.81]So we're not going to do that yet.
[07:17.91]In fact, I'm going to put you over here.
[07:21.18]That's better.
[07:26.34]Because this is my shit monitor that apparently is the only one that works.
[07:31.57]I don't like that.
[07:32.09]I don't like this.
[07:32.57]You know what I mean?
[07:34.59]I feel like I should be playing, like, Counter-Strike.
[07:37.48]If I'm gonna play like this.
[07:41.38]I gotta move this to IRL.
[07:48.50]You know, I blame that fucking... I blame that long-winded game that we started with.
[07:53.75]You know what I mean?
[08:08.72]I sat there for like an hour and 40 minutes trying to play this game.
[08:22.74]It's the wrong camera.
[08:23.98]I'm showing this to the PlayStation Eye camera.
[08:26.68]There.
[08:27.66]Halloween sound effects.
[08:28.62]Drew's original.
[08:29.48]Alright, let me fix this too.
[08:33.98]This camera should be way more high quality than this.
[08:41.39]Advanced.
[08:42.67]No, no, no, no, no.
[08:45.21]Resolution needs to be 1080p.
[08:52.60]Or at least 1280 by 720.
[08:55.04]Well, that's way too much.
[08:58.03]Whoops-a-daisy.
[08:59.01]There we go.
[09:03.25]Anyways.
[09:04.73]Hi.
[09:04.93]There we go.
[09:05.33]Now you can actually see me in full high definition.
[09:09.45]which sorry for you uh door that's my window what am I drinking I'm drinking down east this this this the last I wasn't drinking it I wasn't gonna drink at all I was gonna have like a coffee and relax and like play a game but that didn't happen and and and now I'm drinking alcohol
[09:39.54]Go on a walk?
[09:42.02]No.
[09:43.64]Something at the window?
[09:48.42]That does actually, that scares me sometimes, I will tell you.
[09:50.50]That, like, actually freaks me out a little bit.
[09:53.14]I feel like somebody could just, like, open that up and, like, come in here with, like, a knife.
[09:59.76]Now I'm, I can't stop looking, I can't stop thinking about that now.
[10:03.86]Yeah, thank you for the birthday wishes, guys.
[10:06.74]Sorry for a stream that, like, wasn't even a stream.
[10:09.25]This is, like, the only stream I could even do this week because I'm fucking all over the place.
[10:14.03]I got birthday stuff this weekend.
[10:17.23]And then, like, next weekend, I think I'm going to Los Angeles.
[10:22.70]Or maybe, I don't know.
[10:23.62]And then, like, the weekend after that, the weekend after that is TwitchCon.
[10:26.34]Like, I don't know.
[10:27.00]I'm just, I just, I want a lot of stuff in my brain.
[10:31.03]A lot of stuff going on.
[10:31.85]So...
[10:33.61]Fishing for compliments?
[10:34.71]No, I don't care.
[10:35.31]You could call me a fucking dumb dickhead McGee and I wouldn't even care.
[10:38.12]I mean, I would.
[10:39.70]It might hurt my feelings a little bit, but it wouldn't cause me pain.
[10:43.60]It would hurt.
[10:44.22]Don't do that.
[10:44.62]It would be mean.
[10:50.06]Is that Pac-Man?
[10:50.62]This is a Pac-Man shirt.
[10:51.65]Absolutely.
[10:53.65]It's a vintage Pac-Man shirt.
[10:57.25]Probably the best video game character ever.
[11:01.41]Now I'm looking at the window.
[11:04.91]Don't do that to me.
[11:08.35]But yeah.
[11:10.18]Sorry sometimes we get a little scatterbrained all over the place.
[11:14.06]The last week or two has been a little... I mean, besides, Demon's Souls has been fun.
[11:18.24]But I've been off schedule a lot and like changing and shit.
[11:22.12]So not particularly happy about that.
[11:26.62]And especially when I have problems like technical issues and physical medical issues at the same time.
[11:33.68]You know what I need?
[11:35.64]Remember those workout dummies that they used to sell?
[11:39.38]And the workout was you beat the shit out of the dummy?
[11:42.86]You kick this dummy's ass and that's a workout.
[11:45.96]And it gives you points for punching him in the face.
[11:49.27]I want one of those.
[11:49.91]I don't think they even make those anymore.
[11:52.05]But I need them.
[11:52.55]I need one of those.
[11:53.03]I need to take my stress out a little bit.
[11:56.43]I just want to beat his face up and get 10,000 points.
[11:59.31]What was it called?
[12:02.95]What was that thing called?
[12:06.29]Boppo?
[12:06.83]No, it was like a workout thing.
[12:08.43]I'm going to look it up.
[12:09.09]Give me a second.
[12:09.63]I'm going to find this.
[12:11.75]It was a thing you beat the shit out of.
[12:13.16]It was like a dummy that you beat up and it was like, nice shot.
[12:16.06]Good job.
[12:17.62]Dummy punch workout.
[12:20.36]Let's see.
[12:25.12]Yeah, there it is.
[12:25.82]I got it right here.
[12:30.99]I think this is it.
[12:32.83]Let's play this.
[12:35.39]I think this is it.
[12:38.74]It's called Bob.
[12:41.54]You just beat his ass.
[12:45.26]Let's take a look.
[12:50.64]Let me get this on a browser source.
[13:02.44]Okay, we might have to watch an ad.
[13:04.02]Alright guys, so a couple days ago I bought myself a Bob.
[13:06.54]See?
[13:06.88]I've been wanting one for a couple of years, but I didn't want to pay full price for it, so I decided to look on eBay, Craigslist, stuff like that.
[13:13.69]You kicked this guy's ass.
[13:15.31]So I've got it down here, I've got the base filled up and everything, and I'm ready to have my first workout with it.
[13:19.65]Okay.
[13:21.03]See?
[13:26.11]See?
[13:32.39]You just, oh, that probably hurt.
[13:36.94]See, I need to do this to this guy.
[13:38.78]Alright, we're going to look up a video of a guy like, I can't close the ad.
[13:58.89]That's so stupid.
[13:59.95]I love it.
[14:03.72]Oh shit!
[14:08.04]Alright, so you understand.
[14:10.42]That's what I needed.
[14:13.11]That's what I want.
[14:15.67]I want one of those.
[14:18.95]No gloves?
[14:19.85]Just like, just wreck the fucking guy.
[14:21.91]Alright, let's look up like somebody breaking it.
[14:24.24]Let's see.
[14:24.64]Bob workout break.
[14:38.29]No, I don't think... You know, I'll be the first one to upload that video.
[14:44.29]I don't see any YouTube videos with anybody breaking, like, punching Bob's head off of his shoulders.
[14:51.52]What about this guy?
[14:52.30]This is from seven years ago.
[14:53.60]Let's take a look at this one.
[15:05.94]I bet you I could punch harder than this guy.
[15:08.10]I could do a YouTube video of me knocking his head off.
[15:11.38]Let's take a look at this one.
[15:21.57]Holy shit.
[15:29.95]I don't know.
[15:30.79]Maybe not.
[15:31.70]This guy is kind of kicking his ass.
[15:35.38]Jesus Christ.
[15:46.29]See?
[15:46.49]He's going to knock his head off.
[15:51.51]See these arms?
[15:52.85]Look at these arms.
[15:53.71]They're strong.
[15:54.45]What is that?
[15:59.03]The bug bite or something?
[16:02.89]No, you know what reminds me?
[16:05.05]How many of you guys had those wrestling buddies?
[16:07.15]Remember those things?
[16:08.53]They were the little guys.
[16:10.13]They were like this.
[16:11.30]It was stupid.
[16:12.68]Like this.
[16:14.92]And you picked them up and suplexed them and shit.
[16:16.92]I used to have four of those.
[16:18.62]They were awesome.
[16:21.38]You know what I mean?
[16:22.69]It's like a new version of those.
[16:25.92]They had, like, Ted DiBiase, they had Jake the Snake Roberts, they had, um, like, Hulk Hogan.
[16:36.80]No, they go like this.
[16:38.26]What were they called?
[16:38.74]They were called, like, Brawlin' Buddies.
[16:41.34]I don't know what they were.
[16:52.55]They were tiny.
[16:53.03]They were, like, this big.
[16:55.00]I used to be on the trampoline and I would do like a double backflip suplex and I thought I was awesome.
[17:00.45]And I was.
[17:00.79]I was.
[17:11.90]So I'm 32.
[17:13.94]32 years old.
[17:18.26]What do I got?
[17:19.02]I got a text message.
[17:19.62]It says happy birthday.
[17:24.99]Guess who it is.
[17:27.56]I made it up.
[17:29.00]Nobody did.
[17:32.04]Bullshit.
[17:32.60]I'm 32.
[17:33.14]Yes, sir.
[17:34.20]32 years old.

[18:20.99]You'll see.
[18:29.74]You thought I was going to scream in the mic, didn't you?
[18:31.76]You thought I was going to just absolutely... I'm not like that.
[18:43.31]I broke the audio.
[18:44.37]I did that on purpose.
[18:50.65]So I'm not going to be around for the next three days.
[18:54.07]And then I'm going to be in Los Angeles next weekend.

[19:37.98]Anyways.
[19:40.70]I am going to go.
[19:41.26]I'm going to take off.
[19:44.88]We only had just under a four hour stream today.
[19:47.84]Like eight, nine, ten, eleven.
[19:49.08]Yeah, just about.
[19:49.72]Maybe like three and a half.
[19:53.06]So, um, uh, why am I not celebrating?
[19:55.62]Well, I mean, technically, technically it's like 12, 15 birthday.
[20:00.90]Like I can't, today is my birthday.
[20:03.78]So like when I go to bed and wake up, it'll be like my birthday, you know?
[20:09.22]Uh, before I go though, I do want to say, first of all, I'm going to get off IRL.
[20:12.72]Uh, thanks for sticking around.
[20:15.16]Sorry if, uh, it was a shit show tonight, but you know, but sometimes that happens with this stream.
[20:22.35]I'm going to read some of the bits.
[20:24.13]I didn't have a chance.
[20:24.93]I was all over the place tonight.
[20:25.99]So I'm going to read my bits.
[20:28.05]I will see you later.
[20:28.79]Take care.
[20:29.29]Have fun.
[20:29.81]Goodbye.

[20:34.83]Thank you everybody for watching.
[20:36.97]Nothing tomorrow.
[20:38.73]I'm going to be out.
[20:39.77]I'm not going to be even at my house.
[20:42.11]So I'm not going to be around.
[20:45.30]Much love everybody.
[20:47.98]I am hopeful that you will see me again very soon.
[20:53.09]And if we don't... Cuphead comes out very soon here, right?
[20:59.29]Either like next weekend or like in the middle of this coming week, right?
[21:03.08]So me and Etalyx are going to play the shit out of that.
[21:04.98]There's more Demon's Souls to play.
[21:06.94]I want to play through more Demon's Souls.
[21:09.46]And that's going to be pretty fun because I'm into that game right now.
[21:13.70]So... Thought there was going to be a little bit different of a stream tonight.
[21:17.62]Oh, whoops.
[21:34.33]This is called Dying and Crying from the Halloween CD.
[21:38.33]That person just laughed.
[21:42.96]That's it.
[21:43.82]That was it.
[21:44.14]That was it.
[21:44.46]That was literally the whole track.
[21:45.72]That was it.
[21:49.62]How about Stretch Your Bones?
[22:03.03]That's somebody playing with bubble wrap.
[22:04.53]What the fuck?
[22:08.79]Alright, anyways.
[22:14.08]Thanks, everybody.
[22:14.62]Let me get to the bits here.
[22:16.76]Because there was a lot of money given earlier.
[22:22.36]Turn over the window.
[22:26.70]You'll buy that CD off me.
[22:28.00]I don't think you want this CD, man.
[22:31.11]It is a solid 1 out of 10.
