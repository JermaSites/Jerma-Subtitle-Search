[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.93]We might be here for a little while with this one.
[00:03.19]We might have to give this one a good 40 minutes.
[00:04.61]I don't know.
[00:05.31]I'm not sure yet.
[00:07.62]We'll find out.
[00:09.60]This is a classic.
[00:11.94]And by classic, I mean, actually, it is classic.
[00:15.38]Yeah, it is.
[00:18.00]I think it is, at least.
[00:21.87]It's Dead to Rights Retribution.
[00:23.43]Retribution.
[00:23.79]Retribution.
[00:31.88]No, not Starcraft.
[00:33.92]Dead to Rights.
[00:38.16]God Hand was a classic.
[00:39.06]God Hand is a classic!
[00:39.98]I never said God Hand wasn't a classic.
[00:47.81]Game save data automatically.
[00:49.25]I'm gonna change the... the data here that says what game I'm streaming.
[00:55.83]Is Dead to Rights.
[01:01.22]The hell's the name of this game?
[01:03.58]Dead to Rights Retribution.
[01:08.82]How many Dead to Rights are there?
[01:10.00]Holy shit.
[01:15.52]You didn't even try God Hand.
[01:17.59]We might go back to try that at the end.
[01:21.51]Yeah, this is fun.
[01:24.89]Dead to Rights is an atmospheric and immersive title.
[01:27.51]We recommend you adjust this setting to get the most enjoyment from the game.
[01:33.37]It's sort of an odd image to be showing me.
[01:34.87]Okay, cadet, officer, or detective?
[01:39.86]We'll just go officer.
[01:44.82]Use bark to lure, am I a dog?
[01:49.52]Do you play this game as a dog?
[01:55.73]Thank you, TwoScoops for the bits.
[01:57.03]RadioVidya for the bits.
[01:58.69]Turian7, thank you for the $5 from a little while ago.
[02:02.20]Mothers... Mothers... Wait, what are you saying?
[02:09.68]It's something about leaving a lair with some mothers or something.
[02:12.83]Thank you, Turian, for the $5.
[02:15.27]Appreciate it.
[02:16.89]MostlyLost, thank you for the $10.
[02:20.07]Here's a contribution to the Play Tony Hawk Again Fund.
[02:23.85]Thanks for the ten bucks, dude.
[02:24.87]Um, this is not gonna happen.
[02:26.55]Like, I can't calibrate it.
[02:28.43]It doesn't work.
[02:28.92]I tried.
[02:33.92]Mothers be aware.
[02:34.70]What does mothers be aware of?
[02:36.12]What?
[02:37.86]What the fuck just happened to me?
[02:40.02]Am I drunk?
[02:42.46]I think I just drunkenly fell off.
[02:46.65]Oh, but thank you.
[02:47.73]Monks are lost.
[02:48.77]Maybe we'll try it one more time.
[02:51.74]Soyjoy4040, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[02:54.19]Haircut stream tomorrow.
[02:55.79]Oh.
[02:56.21]This is one of those swear games.
[02:59.73]That's cool.
[03:01.59]No, no haircuts.
[03:02.37]If I'm gonna do a, I probably, I'll try to do an IRL thing from TwitchCon.
[03:07.33]Just, I might, I don't know.
[03:08.83]I'm not gonna promise anything.
[03:10.85]Oh my god.
[03:13.47]Oh, it's a Siberian Husky.
[03:14.77]They're so cute.
[03:22.36]That was an interesting runaway.
[03:24.58]I actually do play as a dog.
[03:25.84]This is a dog game.
[03:30.16]I really thought this was going to be a game where you play as a cop.
[03:41.37]It's a dog game.
[03:42.19]This is awesome.
[03:47.67]Alright.
[03:50.23]I think we found our new favorite game.
[03:55.20]How do I attack?
[03:58.54]Jesus.
[04:00.94]I can like... This is crazy.
[04:11.59]Oh, I can sneak?
[04:13.69]You can drag bodies around.
[04:15.05]So I just have like a hurt human that I have to protect.
[04:26.89]Alright, can I, like, lick him?
[04:29.77]Everything's gonna be alright, don't worry.
[04:32.77]Alright, I gotta go up the stairs.
[04:39.00]This game is a meme?
[04:40.08]Was it a meme?
[04:40.56]I mean, this is from a long time ago.
[04:47.48]Is there a sneak button?
[04:50.02]No.
[04:50.54]I can just run around and bite necks.
[04:56.71]Why wouldn't you shoot?
[04:57.49]Doesn't that seem a little strange that the guy wouldn't pull the trigger?
[05:02.96]I mean, you know, I probably wouldn't either.
[05:07.58]Actually, I'm 99% sure I wouldn't do that.
[05:11.48]Alright, I'll take him.
[05:17.61]Let's drag him.
[05:20.55]I'm pulling him by the hair.
[05:25.42]Oh, come on.
[05:26.40]There's even more of this shit?
[05:30.08]Oh my lord.
[05:32.23]What's the sprint button again?
[05:35.99]Oh, he's alive.
[05:41.51]This dog is fucking... This dog has, like, issues, man.
[05:44.77]Now what?
[05:53.31]Up top?
[05:58.15]Oh, there's one guy over there, of course.
[05:59.45]That's a leaping attack.
[06:04.91]Rip his neck out.
[06:05.57]This game's actually kind of fun.
[06:12.37]Where's this last guy?
[06:13.09]I think eventually I'm gonna get a gun and my guy's gonna feel better.
[06:26.93]Do I only have execute buttons?
[06:30.85]Wait, what?
[06:35.81]Okay.
[06:36.83]Alright, I knocked his legs up.
[06:38.99]And then I fucking cheesesteaked him.
[06:43.64]End credits.
[06:48.02]I bit that guy's hand until he died.
[06:54.93]Okay, we're gonna give this one a little while I feel like this one's a top quality Use guard break to do a strike breaker Next game next game.
[07:10.05]No, don't you guys know the rule for PlayStation hell?
[07:14.33]You got to have 40 we got to give at least 30 to 40 minutes per game With the exception of God Hand because I was angry
[07:25.87]I was just a dog for like two minutes.
[07:27.85]I get to actually play the game now.
[07:32.74]What are you guys smoking?
[07:42.29]Pretty good default proca- pro- procagonist protagonist.
[07:49.45]What about Tony Hawk?
[07:50.17]But Tony Hawk didn't work.
[07:52.24]I can't play a game for 40 minutes that doesn't work.
[07:54.10]Throw a tractor.
[07:54.58]Luchador game is by far the best thing ever.
[07:56.88]My controller was backwards.
[08:16.83]Alright, I'm gonna say this one more time to make sure it's very clear.
[08:21.07]Before the stream started, I spent probably an hour and 40 minutes trying to get that to work every potential direction.
[08:29.10]And it wouldn't work.
[08:31.58]Every perpendicular, left, right, up, down, doesn't matter.
[08:36.34]It just doesn't work.
[08:39.64]I want to make that very clear.
[08:42.77]I want to make that perfectly clear.
[08:45.71]It's a lie.
[08:47.08]Actually, no, you try it.
[08:48.42]Who cares?
[08:49.80]Skip the shit.
[08:51.70]I can't even skip the truth.
[08:53.22]Oh well.
[08:56.50]Hey, the game knew.
[08:59.48]First it was two hours, then three hours, then an hour and forty minutes.
[09:02.46]Look, you fucking give your guess.
[09:04.22]I'm guessing the time.
[09:06.13]And Zool is up there.
[09:08.01]Watch out for the Ghostbusters.
[09:09.15]23!
[09:09.17]Number 23 down there, boys.
[09:09.83]Boys and girls.
[09:14.60]I fucking told you it was everywhere.
[09:16.35]What the fuck?
[09:17.07]That was me that did that.
[09:18.35]That's kind of a dick move.
[09:19.45]Temple Tower, 30 hours ago.
[09:41.17]Oh boy.
[09:41.39]23 was a shitty movie.
[09:42.07]Give me that thing.
[09:42.91]I'm gonna yell into it.
[09:44.15]Give me that thing.
[09:44.85]Have you checked your Verizon bill?
[09:46.19]It's so high.
[10:11.22]Go to T-Mobile and whatever that commercial is, that's what I'm gonna do.
[10:17.79]Well, that was a person.
[10:18.73]Alright, you've just... Can, uh... Okay.
[10:25.37]That wasn't a joke, I was just making a statement.
[10:41.74]Send SWAT to back me up if they ever show.
[10:43.64]I'm giving you a direct order, detective.
[10:45.36]You go in there.
[10:46.22]I'm taking your shield and your gun.
[10:51.24]Dang it.
[10:52.52]What?
[10:52.96]You point it in that direction and you pull this to make it go bang.
[10:58.70]Feel free to point it at a bad guy if you ever end up facing one.
[11:05.83]I kind of need that.
[11:06.51]Do I have to go in there punching?
[11:15.19]Save the hostage.
[11:15.79]Civilians are being executed.
[11:17.04]Save them.
[11:17.62]Okay.
[11:20.08]Okay, that's how you block.
[11:23.26]What is punch?
[11:24.12]Okay, it's... You can't hurt anybody here.
[11:29.22]Okay, just testing.
[11:30.16]How do we sprint?
[11:32.37]You know what I was trying to do.
[11:33.55]It didn't work.
[11:34.03]Whatever these guys had planned, they'd planned it well.
[11:49.91]Left jab that lady as she walked by.
[11:51.41]Alright, jump over the metal detectors.
[11:55.80]Sprint?
[12:00.12]Nah, we gotta do next game.
[12:01.02]There's no dog here.
[12:02.26]That's unfortunate.
[12:04.24]The Union, Iron, and Fury.
[12:05.54]Okay.
[12:10.43]Fast attack, guard break, strong attack.
[12:12.61]Just God Hand again.
[12:15.07]God Hand 2.
[12:17.32]Except this time, it's PlayStation 3.
[12:24.73]He's dead.
[12:33.74]What's the goal here?
[12:34.38]This really is just God Hand again.
[12:41.36]It actually is.
[12:46.16]Okay, block and dash.
[12:47.74]God damn it.
[12:48.24]Come on.
[12:48.62]What was that kick?
[13:12.49]I didn't dodge that.
[13:14.57]Does block block actual... Oh, okay.
[13:17.42]You can counter.
[13:23.20]No, we're not nexting yet.
[13:24.70]Not gonna happen.
[13:27.72]You gotta give it at least a few minutes.
[13:31.86]First boss.
[13:34.31]The Union Dockhand.
[13:42.13]Okay, well, he can't be... I have to, like, dodge around.
[13:44.39]Punch.
[13:49.23]Okay.
[13:50.27]Easy enough.
[13:58.90]Okay, quick change attack to lead to take them.
[14:00.74]My throat is, like, killing me.
[14:02.80]I think I'm coming out with a cold.
[14:03.82]I really think I am.
[14:04.57]That sucks.
[14:05.99]Right before TwitchCon?
[14:06.69]Are you really fucking kidding me?
[14:08.67]I'm gonna get sick before TwitchCon?
[14:10.17]That's great.
[14:10.47]Okay.
[14:22.15]I can like feel it in the back of my neck just like that usually happens after you go to an event like that but apparently it's happening before yeah pull your ears away from your headphones because it's going to go into your brain I'm going to get wait how did I get up there what the
[14:49.12]Oh my god.
[14:50.12]Did I just do that up there?
[14:53.14]I just did that.
[14:53.98]They are not, like, holding back here.
[15:00.25]What the hell?
[15:05.69]Alright, well, that's an interesting start.
[15:12.43]It's gonna be some clone bullshit.
[15:16.19]Clone of my clone.
[15:17.80]Did something terrible.
[15:20.09]It's not going to happen to me, too, is it?
[15:21.34]It's going to happen to me.
[15:24.78]We can do the same thing.
[15:26.58]They couldn't afford more than three character models.
[15:30.12]What does L2 do?
[15:31.62]Kind of zoom in.
[15:32.48]Uh-uh.
[15:52.57]You got a rocket launcher?
[15:53.95]Alright.
[15:59.20]Perform a disarm with X. How do I shoot the... How do you shoot the gun?
[16:07.22]How do you shoot gun?
[16:10.26]R2... I'm pressing R2, guys.
[16:17.23]R2 doesn't work.
[16:19.09]Okay, the gun... I can't shoot the gun.
[16:31.41]I broke his neck in half.
[16:32.75]What a sick Lucha move.
[16:33.89]Alright.
[16:34.77]L2 does nothing.
[16:36.97]R1 pulls gun out.
[16:39.47]R1.
[16:40.45]X. Circle.
[16:41.99]Nope.
[16:42.75]Triangle.
[16:43.59]R2.
[16:48.17]At least this guy's letting me do this.
[16:53.62]Well, okay, so that's L1.
[16:57.42]L1 shoots.
[16:59.55]So it's... Okay, it's R2 to zoom in and L1 to shoot the gun.
[17:05.61]What kind of fucked up world are we living in where that's the case?
[17:10.60]Cover, of course.
[17:16.36]Here we go.
[17:23.47]Alright, is it a new gun?
[17:25.33]Hold R1 to pick up a new gun.
[17:39.72]The bindings are wrong.
[17:42.18]Oh well.
[17:43.72]It's not like we're gonna be here for very long.
[17:53.96]Isn't there... There's a slow motion here, isn't there?
[17:55.72]Just fuck.
[18:03.31]Got him.
[18:05.05]This has to be a slow motion.
[18:06.15]It's a game that came out in like 2005.
[18:07.04]What's a reload?
[18:12.28]Not that.
[18:20.03]Clinch.
[18:21.37]Hostage.
[18:22.13]Throw.
[18:23.39]The game just got ten times better.
[18:27.00]So you use this, you grab, and then the person's a hostage, and then you can throw them.
[18:34.64]Let's clinch.
[18:35.53]Let's clinch the playoffs here.
[18:36.67]Let's get somebody.
[18:37.29]Okay, now he's a hostage.
[18:44.69]And now we can throw him.
[18:46.03]So we're obviously throwing him this way.
[18:49.49]No, we're not.
[18:50.83]He goes forward.
[18:56.00]Come here, you fucking idiot!
[18:57.32]Okay, it worked.
[19:04.06]Now you guys... Now we have to stay in here.
[19:06.99]We can't leave this game.
[19:11.47]Because you know we're gonna be able to throw somebody into like a train.
[19:18.77]Can we throw somebody into somebody else?
[19:22.47]These guys do- we're really moving in sync together very well.
[19:27.71]Like, we planned this.
[19:28.61]It's like a dance.
[19:36.44]Shoot!
[19:36.68]Just shoot him!
[19:41.12]Come here!
[19:42.10]Oh my god, just grab him!
[19:44.80]For the love of god.
[19:50.37]This backwards shit is really annoying.
[19:52.49]These guys all sound like Bill Burr.
[19:56.22]Okay.
[20:05.04]Uh... Can I pick up the phone?
[20:10.02]Probably not.
[20:14.58]Oh shit!
[20:15.20]Oh Jesus!
[20:15.96]Oh God!
[20:21.49]What?
[20:25.73]L1 activates focus mode.
[20:34.10]Okay, so I didn't save that one.
[20:36.02]I got turned into spaghetti.
[20:47.45]Dude, come on.
[20:48.47]L1 has been not the same.
[20:52.94]Does that eventually kill him?
[20:57.19]Yeah, L1 is shoot, guys.
[21:04.35]R2 and L... Oh, my lord.
[21:06.87]Focus mode.
[21:08.15]Use skill to gain focus reward.
[21:11.59]Headshots, takedown combos, counters.
[21:13.29]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:13.97]Jack and... Jack Sparrow's kills, whatever.
[21:16.30]Champion kills.
[21:21.90]Was that a hostage?
[21:22.62]I don't know.
[21:23.42]That guy had a... It might have been.
[21:28.25]I'm not sure.
[21:35.33]Okay, bilber!
[21:36.15]Need to find cover!
[21:40.72]That already puts me into focus mode, doesn't it?
[21:44.66]Oh shit, I have no guns.
[21:54.51]What am I doing?
[21:55.81]What's going on?
[21:57.77]What's going on with this guy's neck?
[22:01.70]Oh, I can karate chop him.
[22:04.94]Does that do anything?
[22:06.12]Oh, no.
[22:07.12]Give me your gun.
[22:12.41]Give me the gun.
[22:13.29]Give me his gun.
[22:17.21]Oh, God.
[22:18.51]Just fucking punch him in the face till he dies.
[22:28.41]This is Max Payne, you're right.
[22:29.85]There's a version of Max Payne that's not very good.
[22:34.41]Fucking god damn it.
[22:46.32]You can do a clothesline?
[22:47.86]That works.
[22:50.36]I have to go into the... Okay, how do I go into the options here?
[22:52.58]Because this shit is so fucked up.
[22:54.34]It's actually making me annoyed.
[22:55.90]Alright, controls.
[23:00.11]I don't think I can change them.
[23:06.67]Gore level?
[23:08.09]Hi.
[23:10.11]Yeah.
[23:12.90]You press the eject button on the disc.
[23:20.64]Yep.
[23:23.02]Here's a machine gun.
[23:23.80]Why am I not getting any focus?
[23:31.03]I've got like five headshots.
[23:34.41]Why would you run in front of me?
[23:36.17]Fuck, my shoot gun is tied to focus.
[23:39.11]I can't... Every time I press L1, it starts the focus, and that's the only way I can shoot my gun.
[23:56.29]Yep, that's fairly sad.
[24:03.83]Where's this- where's this heavy guy?
[24:06.17]Out here?
[24:10.76]Get- Eee, fuck off.
[24:17.72]Alright, how do I take out the helicopter?
[24:22.09]What does it want me to do?
[24:23.65]What do you want me to do?
[24:26.94]I think he's shooting missiles over here or something.
[24:34.17]Is this gonna save me?
[24:41.43]R1 does not reload.
[24:42.89]Yes, it does.
[24:46.41]Why would you shoot a rocket launcher that close?
[24:48.55]Honest to God.
[24:49.69]And how are you still alive?
[24:52.44]How would you be able to live through that?
[24:54.44]My gun is still firing.
[24:56.32]What the fuck, man?
[25:01.49]That guy didn't take any damage from that.
[25:08.31]Something tells me that's a load of shit.
[25:11.27]It's okay, though.
[25:11.95]Let's move forward.
[25:17.33]Watch out for the guy with the fucking rocket launcher.
[25:20.63]God damn it.
[25:21.13]He's going to shoot it over here.
[25:27.52]okay watch out guy with the fucking rocket launcher is seriously he is a psycho did he kill die come here oh my god don't do it why would you use this as a pistol why would you shoot this as a pistol who is that
[25:57.11]I don't have time for this shit.
[26:04.67]I guess he killed a hostage.
[26:07.79]Whatever.
[26:08.11]I'm gonna have to, like, snipe him, because that's gonna keep happening.
[26:18.50]Okay, I'll be fine here.
[26:24.74]And you're talking about that fucking PogChamp scenario right there.
[26:28.34]Behind the... That is the equivalent of standing at the very end of the court.
[26:32.32]Backwards.
[26:33.18]And throwing the fucking basketball behind you and getting it all across the court.
[26:36.91]There it is again.
[26:42.07]I just figured out how to play this game.
[26:54.11]Alright, didn't work that time, but it's alright.
[26:57.69]Holy shit, man.
[27:04.27]Jesus Christ!
[27:07.10]Did you notice how he was looking left and right?
[27:10.34]Okay, we got another guy to shoot.
[27:14.68]That's good.
[27:16.80]Pinpoint accuracy.
[27:17.82]He's gonna do it again.
[27:18.50]Okay, we're fine.
[27:27.07]Where's the hostage?
[27:27.83]There's a hostage right in there.
[27:30.47]Right next to him.
[27:33.33]No, don't.
[27:36.31]I'm gonna bait it out.
[27:46.03]Jesus!
[27:47.49]No, no!
[27:48.13]There's nothing left to go this way.
[27:50.27]Go to the right, go to the right, go to the right, go to the right.
[27:54.37]Jesus!
[28:05.78]That was some Scooby-Doo shit right there.
[28:07.90]That was like an anime battle.
[28:14.08]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[28:16.56]Wait, wait, wait.
[28:18.42]Don't fucking shoot him.
[28:20.17]Wait until I get to a better position.
[28:23.81]This guy doesn't...
[28:35.56]What's happening?
[28:42.82]Oh my god.
[28:44.32]What happened to my rocket launcher?
[28:48.64]Those of you guys wanted to next this game and that was a mistake.
[28:52.32]We just barely got into it.
[28:54.51]What am I doing?
[29:06.66]That's... Go take a ride!
[29:19.03]I think I just... Oh, I'm never gonna fucking extract her.
[29:21.68]It's not gonna happen.
[29:23.98]This is the guy that I shot.
[29:24.86]Where's the rocket launcher?
[29:31.32]Well, is she gonna follow me?
[29:37.51]I will never beat this mission, by the way.
[29:38.93]It's never gonna happen.
[29:40.99]See, they're adapting.
[29:41.73]That guy was just trying to do a thing I've been doing the whole game.
[29:45.94]I'm a duck.
[29:52.40]I'm so sad that I just... I can't even... I spend this shit every second.
[29:58.22]You know what?
[29:58.58]It's because of the controller.
[30:00.50]It's a DualShock 4.
[30:01.26]Is she coming?
[30:05.27]Okay, good.
[30:10.95]There it is again.
[30:13.03]Where did you come from?
[30:16.13]Alright, how do I break his neck?
[30:21.99]Not like that.
[30:28.11]How do I break his neck?
[30:29.00]I know there's a way.
[30:31.74]No, that's like, that's to use the guy as a shield.
[30:38.94]Is that guy on our team?
[30:40.04]I'm not sure.
[30:40.68]Maybe I should shoot him.
[30:42.08]Did that guy just lie and say that I got him?
[30:49.57]Wait, what?
[30:54.15]He just broke his cuffs off.
[30:56.47]Oh, fuck.
[30:57.29]I don't have a clear shot.
[31:05.10]Sounds like I'm still alive.
[31:09.26]What the fuck?
[31:11.16]There we go.
[31:11.54]Finally.
[31:11.80]Somebody finally fucking killed him.
[31:13.20]It only took like 20 minutes.
[31:16.04]Where's my gun?
[31:19.22]Somebody get that goddamn phone.
[31:20.64]Alright, well, there it is over here.
[31:30.51]You have the right to remain silent.
[31:32.87]You have the right to remain silent.
[31:34.15]Anything you say, will, or do turn you into a fucking jello ball.
[31:38.75]Then I'll juggle your ass.
[31:44.91]Dammit.
[31:45.41]Okay, well I gotta sprint and grab... Wait.
[31:47.59]There's one there.
[31:49.55]What happened to the dog?
[32:00.06]Well, that was a big mistake, because now I'm gonna do the funny joke.
[32:05.87]Hey, now everybody in chat's gonna write, L-U-L.
[32:08.59]Watch, it's gonna be, fucking everyone's gonna start laughing.
[32:12.51]What the hell was that?
[32:16.21]Did that guy just land?
[32:16.89]That guy just landed right then.
[32:20.42]Alright, now that was kind of funny.
[32:23.66]Where is this, like, diplomat?
[32:29.76]What are you doing?
[32:32.88]How do I get... How do I extradite this person?
[32:34.82]Come on!
[32:37.14]You can't pretend to be a trash can anymore.
[32:39.00]We have to go.
[32:39.42]We gotta leave.
[32:46.47]That was... That's like a 700 caliber bullet.
[32:48.75]Come on!
[32:53.42]Aren't I supposed to like rescue this hostage?
[33:00.07]Let's go!
[33:05.05]Do I actually have to do this to the door?
[33:12.10]Something might have screwed up here.
[33:23.07]You're not going to move, are you?
[33:26.11]Okay, now she's going to move.
[33:31.78]All I did was just give her ruby slippers.
[33:34.53]Fucking click those a few times, Dorothy.
[33:36.35]Maybe you end up at the house.
[33:39.87]Fucking laughing about him a little bit, just a tiny bit.
[33:42.41]Come on.
[33:44.17]Go.
[33:47.41]Go.
[33:48.57]What is stopping this person from moving?
[34:00.99]The game is just chugging.
[34:02.51]It's having lots of trouble.
[34:03.75]I don't think I can... I think I have to kill it.
[34:07.17]I'm gonna have to, like, throw her into a wall or something, because I think she has to, like, touch... She has to, like, grab something or touch something, right?
[34:14.44]We're gonna go down the elevator?
[34:16.88]Nope.
[34:17.34]Uh, Union Sniper!
[34:20.86]Thanks for letting me come out of the cutscene.
[34:24.50]Where is she now?
[34:27.32]She's still back here.
[34:30.59]I mean, I got the cutscene, but she's still hanging out here.
[34:35.09]No, now she's curled up here.
[34:36.63]Alright, we have to get her out there.
[34:44.20]This might take a little while, but I ain't gonna fail the mission because she's sitting back here.
[34:49.26]I'll fail the mission because she's gonna get sniped.
[34:52.00]That's a risk I'm willing to take.
[34:53.11]Do you guys notice that the phone rings when I cross a certain threshold?
[35:05.63]The phone loads.
[35:08.25]That's great.
[35:08.89]I love it.
[35:11.05]I can't pick her up.
[35:11.78]I wish I could.
[35:16.76]I can't move her.
[35:18.70]She'll move in a minute.
[35:28.95]She's not taking damage.
[35:30.13]We're just acting.
[35:31.99]That's an act, guys.
[35:33.74]Notice how, look, I'm not even... Look at the screen.
[35:36.36]I'm not even coming close.
[35:38.30]It's the seat.
[35:38.80]She has full health.
[35:41.34]We're just practicing for, like, one of our... We're doing, like, a Shakespeare play later.
[35:49.50]This is gonna be not worth it.
[35:50.78]She's gonna walk out here.
[35:51.46]She's gonna get instantly headshot.
[35:54.92]She's, like, doing a little fucking egg impersonation she's doing.
[36:01.09]This is what you came for, guys.
[36:05.85]We're almost there.
[36:09.36]She only likes to move in one direction.
[36:13.44]And then you slip off a little.
[36:14.52]Alright, let's try, like, this is easier.
[36:18.73]Alright, let's go.
[36:21.71]Time to go visit the fucking sniper.
[36:25.59]I have to, like, make her move.
[36:26.73]I have to, like, get her up.
[36:27.99]Get... Alright.
[36:28.83]So, if I, like, shoot her in, like, the... I'm not gonna shoot her... I'm not actually gonna shoot her.
[36:31.67]I'm gonna shoot the heel.
[36:33.69]See?
[36:35.55]I'm just gonna walk... Alright, I got it.
[36:41.17]See?
[36:41.67]Her shoes are red.
[36:42.79]That... That just means I, like, hurt the shoes.
[36:45.97]Oh, God.
[36:46.43]There it is.
[36:49.11]He's got... He's got a line of sight right here, I think.
[36:52.31]Does he have a line?
[36:55.44]I don't think he has a line.
[36:59.43]I'm not even sure this person can get shot.
[37:01.75]This might be a waste of time.
[37:05.31]Well, he's sniping me.
[37:13.63]Alright, well, it... We got her this far, I might as well get her through the door.
[37:20.94]The last, like, nine minutes has been this, so might as well, like, just finish it up.
[37:30.44]Can I crouch?
[37:36.00]No, the sniper doesn't even care.
[37:37.06]They don't care.
[37:37.76]Because I... I can just leave her all... Okay, now, if I just leave her there... No one's going to even attack her.
[37:46.45]She's like an invisible NPC to everybody.
[37:53.05]Well, it was worth a shot.
[37:53.93]I may not have even given up yet.
[38:01.53]Oh, fuck it.
[38:02.01]Let's go.
[38:02.27]Yeah, all they care about is me.
[38:09.33]That's fine.
[38:16.89]Oh, that wasn't even the sniper.
[38:19.17]Where's the sniper?
[38:22.31]Oh, there's the sniper.
[38:24.29]You know, you would think the sniper would be shooting when I was in... When I was really far away.
[38:30.40]Not when I got really close.
[38:34.68]I thought I was going to turn around.
[38:35.62]There I am.
[38:42.67]You're the worst fucking sniper ever.
[38:46.09]Ever.
[38:49.99]Why is she running?
[38:50.57]Where are you going?
[38:51.23]Why are you doing this now?
[38:55.97]This elevator will lead you to the 974.
[38:58.50]The broadcast studio is in that parking area.
[39:06.65]Good luck.
[39:14.33]God damn it!
[39:16.96]No!
[39:25.61]Thought it was oh my god.
[39:26.97]I thought it was seriously like it.
[39:29.06]I have no excuse guys I thought that that would hurt like story arc was over Let's go quick do it quick Just do it quick.
[39:38.46]Just do it quick.
[39:39.11]Please just we can't leave this game yet.
[39:41.11]Oh
[39:42.48]Kill him.
[39:43.00]Kill him.
[39:43.42]Fucking shoot him.
[39:45.54]Shoot this guy, please.
[39:46.54]How do I shoot him?
[39:51.68]Shoot him!
[39:54.12]I'm so-
[40:07.09]Oh, man.
[40:08.89]Oh, well.
[40:09.99]Look, I know.
[40:11.72]I'm sorry.
[40:14.46]We're going to go real quick.
[40:15.84]She runs up anyways.
[40:17.46]Kill the sniper.
[40:19.06]Watch out for the guys that are unarmed that run over here.
[40:25.52]That's good.
[40:27.44]Go.
[40:28.57]Speedrun this part.
[40:29.31]We don't have to stick around for anything.
[40:32.07]Sniper is going to get the cutscene for the sniper.
[40:41.13]Grab his gun.
[40:41.61]You fucking idiot.
[40:47.39]Funny joke.
[40:50.71]Got it.
[40:54.01]There you go.
[40:54.59]Pistol.
[40:55.01]Shoot him.
[40:56.31]There comes the sniper.
[41:01.39]There he is.
[41:02.23]Good.
[41:03.82]We're back where we were.
[41:08.91]Not a drop of milk was spilled.
[41:11.05]Don't worry, guys.
[41:11.79]Here she comes.
[41:18.75]Grab the sniper rifle.
[41:21.05]Utilize it on an actual bad guy.
[41:22.70]One more.
[41:31.56]Okay.
[41:32.64]Everything is good.
[41:33.50]Escort the civilian to the elevator.
[41:37.26]Here she is.
[41:38.76]Give me the cutscene.
[41:39.92]Don't shoot her.
[41:46.66]Okay, so now let me explain my theory here.
[41:48.58]I was like, I thought, oh, you did it.
[41:51.48]She's just like a regular shitty NPC now.
[41:53.04]You know what I mean?
[41:55.32]I was certain of that.
[41:57.34]Good.
[41:57.76]Now we're fine.
[42:00.08]Let me keep going.
[42:07.61]There was still no sign of SWAT.
[42:09.79]Why would I kill them?
[42:10.93]No way.
[42:11.83]Something else going on in the city.
[42:14.29]Something that would draw SWAT away from the tower and keep them busy.
[42:19.53]I can't shoot the TV.
[42:21.61]It's kind of annoying.
[42:25.52]No, we're not next in yet.
[42:29.62]The games we have left are even worse than this, just to let you know.
[42:33.76]I'm going to be real with you guys.
[42:37.75]The next two or three games are the worst of the whole night.
[42:41.27]This is a long elevator sequence.
[42:47.46]I was going to say, Jesus.
[42:59.32]Oh, what that was perfect.
[43:01.92]He's just killing hostages.
[43:03.34]What?
[43:04.34]Okay, that's the worst guy in every game you have like fucking siege Don't run away.
[43:21.17]He's picking up a gun.
[43:23.53]Holy shit.
[43:24.65]Okay Let's do it
[43:34.23]Somebody just went by my face.
[43:37.39]Okay, well.
[43:42.52]Whoops.
[43:44.12]No, don't let him die.
[43:44.96]Is he a hostage or what?
[43:46.38]I don't know who to shoot.
[43:48.12]This guy's like a fitted L. I love it.
[43:59.95]This is perfect.
[44:06.64]I wish I... He's okay.
[44:10.66]He's fine.
[44:12.08]I might have had a bullet bite and gone through him, but it's okay.
[44:14.38]Don't worry.
[44:14.64]You're worried about guns?
[44:18.97]Can we trade guns?
[44:23.07]Anything over there?
[44:24.49]Can you light on fire?
[44:26.53]No.
[44:28.30]Keep coming this way.
[44:30.36]You're way better than me at the game, so you need to stay with me.
[44:34.87]Alright, go for it.
[44:36.63]We already got the guys that are all over there.
[44:41.62]I wish I had, like, three hostage friends.
[44:43.38]I don't understand why they do that.
[44:48.54]That's such a stupid move.
[44:49.64]That guy didn't even know where he was.
[44:57.51]What the fuck was that?
[44:58.35]Did somebody just- are some people throwing grenades?
[45:09.63]I wanted to see if he could do it.
[45:10.85]There's a guy back there throwing grenades.
[45:20.73]Is there anybody even back there?
[45:23.27]Holy shit, there's a lot of people here.
[45:32.72]Oh, he's got a gun.
[45:33.74]Don't let him get a gun.
[45:39.30]Give me the gun.
[45:41.80]Got it.
[45:42.46]Alright, let's move forward.
[45:46.24]I can't feel my hands.
[45:52.69]I'm confused here.
[45:53.59]What am I looking at?
[45:57.01]Where is this camera?
[46:02.25]That just looked like it was my person.
[46:03.43]I thought there was a person back here.
[46:04.53]I thought that was like a hole.
[46:07.18]Weird camera angle.
[46:08.28]Look, see?
[46:09.24]Who's taking these photos?
[46:10.28]How do you know where I was, dude?
[46:17.46]Come on.
[46:18.99]Come here.
[46:26.89]Give me the weapon.
[46:36.04]And I missed.
[46:38.60]I actually missed that.
[46:39.85]You gotta be shitting me.
[46:42.83]How the fuck am I still alive?
[46:46.91]Honestly, how?
[46:53.40]Shoot the gun!
[46:58.00]I'm actually having fun.
[46:59.03]This game is actually fun.
[47:00.45]It's a fun game.
[47:01.27]How big is your vocabulary when you say fun?
[47:04.17]Fun.
[47:04.37]The game's fun.
[47:04.97]Fun game.
[47:05.55]Fun.
[47:05.83]I think I took more than a few shots.
[47:17.90]Look, we didn't even get the grenades yet.
[47:19.14]There's still potential to get grenades.
[47:28.36]Channel 23, news at 10.
[47:29.28]Locate the TV studio.
[47:30.77]Oh shit, I think I have to save that guy.
[47:46.33]Alright, this is where I need the sniper rifle.
[47:53.26]I'm gonna take him out, right?
[47:55.28]Save the hostages.
[47:55.94]Save Temple and the remaining civilians.
[47:57.58]I need a sniper.
[47:59.48]Can I just shoot him from back here?
[48:02.26]I might be able to.
[48:03.63]Like, scout scattergun.
[48:05.11]They don't hear me.
[48:09.45]That must have been a bird.
[48:19.80]I guess we have to go around.
[48:21.18]Right?
[48:22.38]Didn't I come from here?
[48:23.92]No, don't sit on the couch.
[48:25.80]I just came this way.
[48:27.94]Yeah, it's a scattergun.
[48:52.64]Can I open this door?
[48:57.46]I guess.
[48:58.22]Whatever.
[49:05.39]I was going to go for it.
[49:06.33]I was going to try.
[49:08.31]Oh, god damn.
[49:10.61]He's going to kill... Did I get it?
[49:13.26]I saved the hostage.
[49:18.22]I have to shoot the gun again to turn off focus mode.
[49:23.54]Oh, boink!
[49:27.44]That's a hostage!
[49:28.74]That's a good thing I missed.
[49:31.04]I was gonna make a fucking scout joke.
[49:35.09]He's dead, right?
[49:35.67]Yeah, he's dead.
[49:52.62]Give me that scattergun.
[49:53.48]This is the best one.
[49:59.39]You don't still stand from that.
[50:00.61]I'm sorry, dude.
[50:01.51]No, not a chance.
[50:02.69]What is this?
[50:04.45]What is this?
[50:04.95]Dynamite?
[50:06.77]C4?
[50:08.01]Grenade.
[50:09.34]How do you throw a grenade?
[50:17.88]Was that a grenade or was that like a firework?
[50:20.48]That didn't do anything.
[50:22.50]Just startled him.
[50:23.22]I just jump scared that guy with a grenade.
[50:25.40]Huh?
[50:29.78]Nice dud.
[50:32.58]Alright, so I gotta be careful there.
[50:33.67]I gotta pull out... What do I do?
[50:35.69]Do I have any other weapons?
[50:38.01]Wish I had that fucking grenade now.
[50:39.35]Okay, here we go.
[50:43.89]Open the door.
[50:47.47]Can I open the door gently?
[50:50.09]No.
[50:56.17]I already threw the grenade.
[50:56.99]See?
[50:57.21]The grenades don't even do anything.
[50:58.31]Explosions don't hurt anybody in this game.
[51:04.88]He was never hurt from again.
[51:05.78]He died.
[51:12.70]Don't let him get away.
[51:16.81]Uh, well, which way did he go?
[51:18.28]I guess he went this way.
[51:24.14]I'm going to find him.
[51:24.72]I'm going to sprint around him.
[51:28.73]I've saved pretty much all the hostages.
[51:31.91]And by all, I mean maybe three people gone otherwise.
[51:34.49]It's okay, though.
[51:42.62]I'm gonna throw guys off the cliff.
[51:43.76]No, we're throwing them back in the cliff.
[51:49.01]Alright, but I'll do it.
[51:52.59]I'll get it.
[51:57.09]Take this guy to the peak.
[51:59.79]And then throw him over.
[52:00.67]No, let's just throw him over now.
[52:03.22]Come here.
[52:11.24]You know, it's not funny like the fifth time.
[52:21.66]But it's funny the sixth time!
[52:30.92]The flare wore off a long time ago.
[52:34.86]Is that guy from fucking Resident Evil?
[52:36.24]What's that guy's name?
[52:36.86]HUD?
[52:39.62]HUD, right?
[52:41.42]Mud?
[52:41.70]What's the guy, what's the Resident Evil guy's name?
[52:50.66]What?
[52:50.86]Come on.
[52:51.44]Dude, that's... Give me a break.
[52:58.43]Oh, God.
[52:59.41]My, like, internet's dying.
[53:05.61]Uh...
[53:07.43]Well, this isn't good.
[53:08.77]Comcast is like dying right now.
[53:11.43]My internet's shit in the bed.
[53:19.87]Well, let's wait a second.
[53:22.96]See if this evens out.
[53:33.94]It looks pretty bad.
[53:42.80]I'm looking over at my... It seems to be okay now.
[53:48.26]It did just kind of take a dump on itself.
[53:53.54]I think we're okay.
[53:57.77]Might have just been a small hiccup.
[54:01.75]Let's hope so.
[54:03.31]Alright, we're good.
[54:05.99]Back to normal.
[54:12.14]Old cast.
[54:13.78]I wish I could do something besides Comcast, but I think it's alright now.
[54:16.64]Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be chasing somebody.
[54:19.93]I can do that move too.
[54:35.73]It is.
[54:36.11]You know what?
[54:36.99]It's actually easier just to do this.
[54:38.84]That didn't kill him, did it?
[54:42.10]No, he's dead.
[54:42.70]I was going to say, that would be terrible.
[54:47.62]It's been 40 minutes?
[54:48.64]Yeah, but we're still interested.
[54:52.43]It's still interesting.
[54:53.29]He's doing a very good job to avoid my bullets.
[54:58.81]Come here.
[55:10.42]I gotta run, chase, right?
[55:12.70]Chase him.
[55:15.74]That guy's not even facing the correct direction.
[55:21.38]Who killed that guy?
[55:22.71]That guy was sitting down, aiming over here.
[55:26.81]What the fuck?
[55:29.29]That guy took my gun.
[55:34.80]These frames are killing me.
[55:46.50]I got another gun.
[55:48.68]Easy enough.
[55:51.48]I don't want to use any bolts.
[55:53.16]Why would I use bolts?
[55:53.89]I don't have to.
[55:58.33]Alright, let's go.
[56:03.11]Frame dropping, yeah.
[56:08.38]Okay, bye.
[56:11.54]Bye, Wilhelm.
[56:14.36]He's one of their highly trained snipers.
[56:21.76]He's gonna headshot this guy.
[56:25.26]Come on, headshot him.
[56:27.36]Be a good sniper.
[56:28.40]Well, almost.
[56:32.02]Nice.
[56:32.86]Two body shots.
[56:33.70]This guy's not even a good sniper.
[56:39.58]At least I get the rifle.
[56:44.46]No!
[56:45.00]Shit, the rifle fell off the goddamn cliff.
[56:50.38]Fuck, I really wanted that.
[56:55.81]no skill body shot yeah pretty much see that guy wasn't me he just looked like me
[57:21.98]It's a cliff.
[57:22.76]Don't you guys understand?
[57:25.47]Every single long fall is a cliff.
[57:27.71]He's giving me the finger.
[57:28.85]So far, so good.
[57:53.58]Boom.
[57:57.90]You understand next.
[57:59.60]That's alright.
