[00:53.53]Somebody said, hey, can you address the Labubu controversy?
[00:59.03]I didn't know what it was right now in the offline chat.
[01:04.06]And I guess apparently I have to address it.
[01:08.61]Okay, there you go.
[01:15.40]What about the cheese crepe controversy?
[01:17.76]That was you in chat said, hey, you should have cheese crepes for dinner.
[01:21.68]And I said, okay, dude.
[01:23.55]And then we moved on.
[01:24.45]I don't know what the fuck you guys are talking about today.
[01:33.96]What about the Elden Ring movie?
[01:37.22]I don't know.
[01:37.68]Maybe I'll watch it.
[01:39.32]Who knows?
[01:39.93]Maybe it's good.
[02:01.80]Chat's going too fast.
[02:03.66]I can't read all these.
[02:05.25]What's your favorite kind of type of bagel and topping?
[02:09.13]Onion bagel.
[02:12.23]And a chive cream cheese or onion bagel with a, you know, an egg sandwich.
[02:19.48]Egg cheese.
[02:20.16]Maybe a little bit of ham.
[02:21.12]Maybe sausage.
[02:23.14]An onion bagel.
[02:23.75]That's right.
[02:25.99]Hello, everybody.
[02:26.73]Welcome.
[02:27.21]Hi.
[02:27.77]Today.
[02:29.53]Very special day today.
[02:31.89]because today we are going to try to power through Dracula 3.
[02:39.30]If you joined us the last time we played Dracula 3, the game was dog shit.
[02:44.72]And it was a very, very slow burn.
[02:47.71]I made about 40 to 50 phone calls.
[02:52.13]It ended up being like a detective game.
[02:54.05]Dracula hasn't even shown up yet.
[02:55.27]We don't even know what he looks like in this game.
[02:58.36]So here's the deal.
[03:00.50]I have made a cocktail.
[03:06.58]Wait, what is it?
[03:07.31]It says ad in progress.
[03:09.95]Is there an ads right now?
[03:13.55]It says that I'm running 17 minutes of ads right now.
[03:19.58]That is not accurate.
[03:20.98]I looked over and said, wait, what the fuck are you talking about?
[03:28.23]Anyways, today we are going to play this game.
[03:38.68]And we're gonna have a good time doing it.
[03:40.98]If this game truly sucks.
[03:44.41]Truly.
[03:49.09]After like two or three hours of powering through this, and I don't care.
[03:52.43]I will cheat.
[03:58.76]If I just say, hey mods, what's the answer to this question?
[04:02.64]We'll just move on, right?
[04:04.64]We have to at least see Dracula once.
[04:08.23]I want to see Dracula one time.
[04:12.87]In at least one cutscene.
[04:14.10]That is the goal for tonight.
[04:19.62]So, I think ads are technically playing right now.
[04:21.63]So, I'll just wait.
[04:24.61]My ad miniature is weird right now.
[04:26.71]It is fucked up.
[04:41.56]But yeah.
[04:42.88]If we want to do something else, and by we, I mean me... Remember, just because you don't like Dracula 3's phone call system, doesn't mean that I don't like it.
[04:54.24]So, we're gonna go by how I feel.
[04:58.72]Dude, my- it's- okay, I'm looking at my Twitch dashboard.
[05:01.69]It's counting backwards.
[05:04.41]Usually I see how long a stream has been.
[05:07.23]It's negative five minutes right now.
[05:09.35]It's counting down backwards.
[05:12.20]Negative numbers.
[05:13.28]Go to zero.
[05:13.68]I don't know what the fuck's going on here.
[05:20.85]Anyways, let us get started.
[05:25.68]I think we're ready to go.
[05:32.00]I'm already loaded up.
[05:33.00]I'm already ready.
[05:33.70]And yes, you better believe it.
[05:35.94]I got something up here today.
[05:38.54]I think a lot of you would be very happy to see this.
[05:41.47]Hey, I got a bush light for tonight.
[05:42.83]Are you drinking a cocktail?
[05:44.09]Wow.
[05:46.81]Well, okay.
[05:47.92]Listen.
[05:49.36]I don't like drinking beer when it's over 100 degrees outside.
[05:54.28]I am a 75 to 98 degree beer drinker.
[06:00.05]I want an iced cocktail today.
[06:03.52]What the?
[06:03.96]No, no, it's not a what the fuck moment.
[06:05.54]It's too hot.
[06:11.23]You drink warm beer.
[06:12.33]No, I just beer.
[06:13.15]It's like it's very it can be kind of busy and carbonation and.
[06:18.15]I don't know, it's it's like too hot for me to drink beer.
[06:25.62]I want a freezing cold.
[06:28.88]Vodka cranberry and that's exactly what I've made.
[06:31.73]Why are you an absolutionist?
[06:35.55]Because I have a preference for what I like to drink during the summer?
[06:43.26]Am I the weird one?
[06:44.04]I don't think so.
[06:52.73]Alright, let's go.
[06:53.38]We know what's going on.
[06:54.92]We know what we're getting into.
[06:57.10]Here we go.
[07:06.09]Take a look.
[07:11.60]Take a look.
[07:15.92]Back.
[07:16.40]You know what that means.
[07:19.97]Let me get my stuff situated.
[07:27.38]Ah.
[07:31.60]Okay.
[07:33.52]So.
[07:34.78]Are we ready?
[07:36.70]And I'm, look what I'm drinking this out of.
[07:38.24]I know people are gonna think I'm a weirdo.
[07:39.33]It's like a fucking, it's like a cup.
[07:41.63]You get it like this.
[07:42.57]It's not a cool cup.
[07:48.14]It's summery.
[07:50.02]Look at, and look, it looks like blood.
[07:51.83]So it's like Dracula.
[07:53.95]That was my, uh, that was my mindset.
[07:58.00]You're such a millennial.
[08:03.86]Ah, okay.
[08:05.53]Hey, drink that.
[08:06.33]I'm not drinking that.
[08:07.05]You guys need to shut up.
[08:11.02]Alright, we were in Budapest, I remember.
[08:14.52]Wait, which Budapest?
[08:19.15]Is this correct?
[08:21.91]Alright, so the last thing I remember before I fell asleep on the stream last time.
[08:27.50]was we have to go do something.
[08:30.66]We gotta go... We did this like... We did this shit and it was... It was dumb and we figured it out, but whatever.
[08:36.87]He hates this game.
[08:41.25]I don't like this game.
[08:42.41]I don't know if I hate this game.
[08:46.97]Okay, hold on.
[08:47.52]Where's my options?
[08:52.24]Alright, everything looks good.
[08:53.08]Subtitles are on.
[08:55.40]Okay.
[08:55.52]Alright, here we go.
[08:57.60]The last thing we had to do.
[09:00.97]I gotta get to a phone.
[09:04.01]I can't talk to you anymore.
[09:05.29]Okay.
[09:07.05]Yeah, I remember this.
[09:13.78]This is the letter from Bram Stoker.
[09:17.91]Okay.
[09:18.79]Alright, so I should just leave, right?
[09:20.19]We got everything we need?
[09:22.32]It's a container of acid.
[09:24.43]If anyone tries to force the strongbox... Stop saying his name like that.
[09:27.77]I like saying his name like that.
[09:31.61]This is no time to take my leave.
[09:34.08]I'm sure the professor has even more things to teach me.
[09:37.14]Alright, well, teach him to me.
[09:41.78]Teach me!
[09:43.17]I'm sitting here waiting.
[09:44.13]This cylinder was cut with a process that's no longer in use.
[09:47.79]I have to find a machine that can read it.
[09:49.95]I'll keep you informed.
[09:51.67]Okay, we need a machine that can read that.
[09:58.37]This way?
[10:01.16]Do I have to read any of these books?
[10:04.88]What was the last thing we did?
[10:05.80]I don't have to do all these, right?
[10:13.85]Do I have to do all seven of these?
[10:18.31]This is the book that I have to do.
[10:20.21]No, it's not.
[10:23.88]I don't have to do all of these, do I?
[10:27.95]Dude, the wind is already out of my sails.
[10:29.95]Don't say... We haven't even started.
[10:33.34]We just opened the game.
[10:34.94]Everybody relax.
[10:36.76]What do you mean it's already over for you?
[10:39.88]No, just chill.
[10:40.81]We just started the game.
[10:45.51]It's already over for me.
[10:50.88]Ah, that's good.
[10:51.56]Okay.
[10:51.68]Okay.
[10:53.90]Might have to solve all these puzzles.
[10:58.27]I don't want to fucking do this.
[11:01.51]Yeah, last time we did this, we were looking for, like, incinerate.
[11:04.70]Oh, like, cataclysm.
[11:05.96]And we instead, the actual answer was ellipsur sack.
[11:11.05]How would I have ever known that?
[11:20.62]Alright, let's do it.
[11:30.61]Brrr... Rum.
[11:39.42]Saint?
[11:42.10]Sin?
[11:47.21]He's drunk?
[11:54.06]Maude, just give me the answer to this.
[11:56.35]I'm not sitting here and doing this for like four hours.
[11:59.03]What's the answer for page three?
[12:00.43]Just what are they?
[12:01.33]What are the answers?
[12:02.93]I don't care about any of this.
[12:04.25]Do you know what I mean?
[12:04.90]I don't think anybody else does either.
[12:07.16]I don't think anybody here cares about this particular puzzle.
[12:12.96]Why are you so impatient?
[12:13.97]No, I'm not impatient.
[12:14.87]It's just look at the last one we had to do.
[12:17.30]It's not words that... It's just... It's weird stuff.
[12:20.64]It's... I see Huel here.
[12:22.57]Right?
[12:22.81]And I mean, I love that fucking drink.
[12:25.17]But I don't know what it has to do with 14th century Europe.
[12:39.21]Maybe I don't have to do that.
[12:40.35]The intro just started.
[12:41.95]Does everybody relax?
[12:43.47]Without this catalog...
[12:44.79]Okay.
[12:46.91]Maybe it's this book.
[12:49.43]We have to prove that we read it?
[12:52.40]Eventually you just talk to her and then you get to leave.
[12:56.34]It won't let me talk to her.
[12:58.18]Maybe I have to solve one more?
[13:03.09]Stop saying it's over!
[13:07.66]We gotta get this one.
[13:08.38]You guys gotta help me.
[13:10.86]Go through all the objects on the table.
[13:16.04]We did this.
[13:16.62]I remember it was the spot the difference.
[13:18.69]We did it.
[13:19.95]Well, he did it.
[13:21.83]Okay, here's all the pages of this book.
[13:24.51]Very cool.
[13:25.93]Here's the note.
[13:26.84]I already read the note.
[13:31.26]That's the cylinder.
[13:32.36]Okay, but that book is fine.
[13:36.93]What about something behind you?
[13:40.19]Where's Dracula?
[13:50.94]Maybe something else I can click on?
[13:53.16]This is no time to take my leave.
[13:56.63]Spoiler page three.
[13:58.49]Oh, hell yeah.
[14:00.45]Alright, we got a page three solution in the mod chat right now.
[14:15.21]I can't see this.
[14:16.70]Okay, hold on.
[14:18.70]Wait, I think they're trolling me.
[14:30.99]Hey, there it is, guys.
[14:32.25]Did you get on your bingo?
[14:33.29]Did you get Oriensoul?
[14:36.22]Did you guys get that?
[14:38.02]Everyone that was making fun of me for the last five minutes, did you get that one?
[14:40.68]Did you get Oriensoul?
[14:45.33]How about, uh,
[14:49.18]How about this one?
[14:50.18]How about... Miparium.
[15:00.07]That one doesn't work.
[15:17.49]I don't... What?
[15:18.05]What?
[15:26.37]The hell is this knee?
[15:33.08]Why is this one not working?
[15:48.50]I hovered over that one like five times.
[15:49.82]You saw it.
[15:50.62]You saw me do this one like five times.
[15:58.75]Yes, I did that five times.
[16:04.00]Okay.
[16:04.76]And then... How come this one doesn't work?
[16:16.79]I can't get that last one to work.
[16:22.44]The difference in each walkthrough?
[16:28.13]You're lucky you can stream for money.
[16:31.85]Dude, I... Okay, every review of this game from 25 years ago said this game sucked.
[16:40.94]They didn't think the puzzles were good.
[16:42.23]They thought they were lame.
[16:42.89]They thought they were boring.
[16:43.57]They thought they were confusing.
[16:44.73]Every single person from 20 years ago said this same exact thing.
[16:48.37]Except for you.
[16:49.25]30 years later.
[16:52.66]Except for you.
[16:55.42]Alright, what?
[16:57.24]How do I... What...
[16:58.98]I just got a completely different answer in the chat.
[17:01.68]Hold on.
[17:09.65]Oh, shit.
[17:10.01]I don't know.
[17:16.50]That chatter just decimated you.
[17:20.38]And we didn't.
[17:27.75]I'm just fine.
[17:29.25]Why is there fucking ads?
[17:31.70]What?
[17:40.03]Why did I get a warning about this?
[17:42.71]Just pretended it on purpose.
[17:51.21]Okay.
[17:54.69]How many do you have to solve?
[17:55.67]Three?
[17:55.97]More than four?
[18:07.41]I remember reading that this was the most convoluted puzzle in the entire game.
[18:10.71]I heard there's like two or three of these that are just like, why am I doing this?
[18:19.92]So why won't this, why won't some of these work?
[18:25.81]Bro, it's a word search.
[18:26.91]It's a word search for Latin words.
[18:29.01]I don't know.
[18:29.65]I don't know what these words are.
[18:40.50]So where do you guys see another one?
[18:51.69]The Blood Puzzle puzzles were different too.
[18:54.26]Just go learn Latin, bro.
[18:58.44]I really hope I don't have to do a fucking third one of these.
[19:00.28]What if I have to do a fourth one?
[19:03.53]Tribuni at the bottom?
[19:10.10]And, like, you can't even highlight the... Dude, what the fuck is going on here?
[19:15.27]Why do I... Why can't I highlight... I can't highlight this way.
[19:17.51]I don't think that's right.
[19:36.04]No, that's not right.
[19:40.57]Is it top left?
[19:41.51]Capra?
[19:45.88]What the fuck is this?
[19:46.84]What is going on?
[19:53.25]Hey, you should have a basic grasp of Latin if you're a streamer.
[19:59.20]Huh?
[20:05.73]Yeah, this is page one.
[20:06.71]This is page two.
[20:11.29]So this is page three.
[20:13.85]I've got three and page three, so I need, what, one more?
[20:17.60]Two more words, apparently?
[20:18.62]I don't know what even words we're even looking for.
[20:22.12]She handed us this book and said, yeah, look, it's a word search.
[20:25.73]I'm not going to tell you what words you should look for.
[20:29.30]I hope you know fucking Latin, like that one guy in your chat.
[20:44.66]just spit all over this because like that's come on man how about like give me a break so where's the last word yeah I bet you I bet you half the people here right now could not use this word in a sentence let alone say it correctly out loud okay that's that's my defense
[21:16.63]Secundum?
[21:18.81]Secundum?
[21:21.78]Where do you see Secundum?
[21:34.10]Next to the M in Imperium.
[21:51.22]Can I talk to her again?
[21:52.22]I didn't even finish her word puzzle.
[21:56.47]No, I have to finish this fucking word search.
[22:00.25]The upper M?
[22:04.66]You guys said secundum.
[22:06.24]Secundum?
[22:06.67]Where do you see secundum?
[22:08.47]I'm going to go off chats.
[22:09.41]Answer here.
[22:16.75]So in Mod Chat, they're linking me the solution for this page, and it's all that we've done so far.
[22:21.60]The first M of Imperium.
[22:29.98]This apparently is the answer.
[22:32.63]That's all for this page.
[22:33.97]But what about page four?
[22:38.63]Why would you do this in a Dracula game?
[22:41.58]Okay, let me just...
[22:47.72]First of all, who wants to do a fucking word search in the Dracula game?
[22:54.85]Nobody, not a single human on Earth.
[22:58.81]They only do two pages in the walkthrough and then they can talk to her.
[23:02.76]Did we not finish the second page or the first page?
[23:08.27]A fucking Latin word search that I don't, I don't get it.
[23:11.97]I'm fucking flustered.
[23:19.36]Try the other books.
[23:26.75]I just want to leave this lady's fucking office.
[23:30.45]Sacrificia on the bottom second page.
[23:33.79]I think we tried that before.
[23:44.48]Let me leave your house.
[24:02.07]I can't even talk to her.
[24:05.67]Page one?
[24:07.56]You need to solve the three riddles.
[24:15.53]Your character is supposed to talk in the crucifixion book about having that same picture.
[24:22.42]The picture book with the cross again?
[24:33.07]Do not let your blood flow in vain.
[24:37.33]Okay.
[24:45.08]Is it bugged?
[24:53.47]Leave to the town.
[24:54.25]You're done.
[24:54.63]Leave to the-
[24:57.94]this is no time to take my leave I'm sure the professor has even more things to teach me yeah because we we did I remember doing the we did the we like remember oh the different is it because I'm holding a bunch of in my inventory because remember we did this it was the oh find the two differences and it was like well we found all the differences we did that last time I'm I think I'm soft locked somehow
[25:32.59]Read the... Wait, maybe the... Yeah, they'll go to the Bible pages?
[25:38.03]I completely forgot about that.
[25:45.26]Why is this red?
[25:59.54]Yeah, we did this last time.
[26:03.18]And he's like, oh, there's an engraving here.
[26:05.36]We talked about it last time.
[26:06.80]We did it last time.
[26:11.21]Is there another hint in this?
[26:24.84]I don't think there's another hint.
[26:30.27]You should probably try Rollercoaster Tycoon instead.
[26:35.95]You know what's the funniest part about this?
[26:38.43]When you have, um, there are about 10,000 people here.
[26:43.92]Five people I'm completely aware of have walkthroughs open on their computers.
[26:51.84]And we still can't get through this.
[26:56.40]I think you might need to cook the game a little, a little longer.
[27:00.59]Uh, 25 years in the future.
[27:06.51]We have, like, four people have walkthroughs open.
[27:09.46]I'm sitting here, you guys are all here, and we can't fucking get through this goddamn game?
[27:28.22]One of the mods said, hey, this walkthrough has a crossfade to this.
[27:32.13]Not sure how far you got last time, and it's like a statue.
[27:35.89]I don't fucking have any idea what's going on, man.
[27:39.79]They think it's bugged.
[27:42.42]Is it actually, is the game actually bugged?
[27:46.10]I'm so confused, man.
[27:49.74]Like what the hell is going on?
[27:53.47]You're crashing out right now.
[27:54.81]I am crashed in.
[27:57.81]I said I was going to have a fucking cocktail and we were going to get through Dracula 3.
[28:02.98]It's going to be a long night.
[28:08.16]Watch it from here.
[28:18.87]Yeah, we did that.
[28:26.76]I don't know why I can't talk to her again.
[28:29.35]I have no idea.
[28:33.77]I don't know why it won't let me leave her office.
[28:38.40]I just skipped forward five seconds and he's sleeping on a train.
[28:44.68]Let me go back to this photo.
[29:07.05]What happened to the audio?
[29:09.02]Oh, there it is.
[29:12.45]I'm trying to look at a walkthrough and it thinks I'm a bot.
[29:18.26]Interact with a cylinder on the table?
[29:20.50]I already did.
[29:22.07]I need a machine that can read it.
[29:26.27]I don't have a machine that can read it.
[29:27.73]I mean, I've got like berries if you want to mush them up and eat them.
[29:32.32]This is the GOG version.
[29:33.50]This is not the Steam version.
[29:48.14]This is unbelievable.
[30:00.54]Yes, your favorite thing to do in the whole game.
[30:07.57]The only thing this guy does is call people on the phone, and he doesn't want to do it now.
[30:12.71]I don't know what happened to the series after two.
[30:15.17]I'll be honest with you.
[30:16.54]One and two were like weird and funny and crazy.
[30:19.32]This one is awful.
[30:21.26]Like a 0.0.
[30:26.71]What happened between two and three?
[30:28.94]This is no time.
[30:37.97]All that happens is she talks and then you can leave.
[30:44.94]Okay, let's... Let's relax.
[30:47.44]Let's get through this.
[30:50.35]Let's get through this.
[30:53.77]Restart this?
[30:54.97]Like, restart it.
[30:56.92]Hold on.
[31:06.49]Should I pick this one?
[31:07.63]I mean, they both... I only have two saves.
[31:13.08]I feel like that's going to be worse.
[31:14.50]Hold on.
[31:21.04]Is there a word that I did?
[31:22.66]Okay, according to the walkthrough, once you do two pages, it's over.
[31:26.30]And then she starts talking to you.
[31:29.93]Read the cream-colored book on the table.
[31:33.92]I did.
[31:34.84]We already did this.
[31:35.48]There's a thing right here, and they both talk about it for a second, and then that's it.
[31:45.57]There's only one page.
[32:02.94]Yeah, the chalice right here, but that was from the two that we didn't know the difference between the two of them.
[32:15.13]Yeah, I can't get... Every time I click to talk, it just does this.
[32:19.92]Like, something's wrong.
[32:20.90]Something's fucked up.
[32:23.36]Alright, should I just reload the... close the game?
[32:29.13]Sacrifice you and not sacrifice... Hold on.
[32:37.11]I don't even know why I can even still do this.
[32:40.37]This is fucking crazy.
[32:43.44]I thought you hated this game.
[32:44.34]Oh, I do.
[32:44.76]This game's awful.
[32:46.14]It's the worst in the series.
[32:47.12]This might be one of the worst games I've ever played.
[32:49.21]But I'm not stopping until we see Dracula.
[32:51.17]And then I'm Alt-F4ing him.
[32:55.62]I want to see Dracula's face and then we can Alt-F4.
[33:14.50]Yeah, I have all the answers on page three.
[33:22.04]This is fucking crazy.
[33:39.60]Is it bad that I would watch him struggle to figure this out for the next hour?
[33:43.60]Well, it's already been like 15 minutes.
[33:45.70]And I'm fucking losing my mind.
[33:48.29]Already.
[33:50.21]I'm going to reload the save and see what happens.
[34:01.99]What about the save before that?
[34:21.43]I definitely don't have to solve this whole book, do I?
[34:27.98]Literally all that happens is solves the first two puzzles here, dialog about going to the library, then you can leave.
[34:37.88]Dude, what the fuck is going on?
[34:40.04]How far away is this one?
[34:54.29]Okay, we're back at the beginning here.
[34:56.95]Okay.
[35:02.60]Alright, now this is personal papers.
[35:07.33]Please open this.
[35:10.39]Okay.
[35:12.20]This one is M. This one here.
[35:23.92]I fucking hate this game.
[35:47.74]It was definitely bugged apparently.
[35:53.87]I'm gonna be so mad when we- when this is just done immediately.
[35:56.70]Thank you for opening the strongbox, father.
[35:59.14]Give me this stupid fucking thumb.
[36:01.40]There you go.
[36:01.84]A wax cylinder and a letter.
[36:11.01]Very interesting.
[36:12.85]Are you familiar with the name of Bram Stoker?
[36:15.85]He's the author of Dracula.
[36:19.94]This is a letter for Mr. Stoker.
[36:22.17]Read the letter.
[36:23.09]Don't care.
[36:24.88]Read it.
[36:27.56]The second half better be fucking... They better be like explosions.
[36:36.89]They better be like betrayal.
[36:38.56]They better be chest stabs.
[36:40.14]They better be people's eyes coming out of their heads.
[36:42.80]This has been the worst first act I've ever seen.
[36:46.30]In no way.
[36:47.86]Somebody said there better be sex.
[36:50.47]That irresponsible man didn't understand half of what I told him.
[36:56.53]Okay.
[36:56.99]Hey, your library I heard is remarkable.
[36:58.76]But it's very hard to find one's way in it.
[37:00.66]Without this catalog... Okay.
[37:03.00]Every time I take a volume... Great.
[37:05.42]Ghosts.
[37:06.36]Yes.
[37:07.13]There are ghosts in the library.
[37:07.85]There are ghosts in the library.
[37:09.45]That's what we call...
[37:11.87]The first trace we have stems from ancient Babylon.
[37:15.37]But it's in Europe.
[37:16.25]Got it.
[37:16.57]For example.
[37:17.56]Got it.
[37:18.80]Good.
[37:19.10]It's very wide.
[37:20.08]Great.
[37:22.50]Let them talk.
[37:24.65]It has to.
[37:25.81]Reports describe hundreds of grave openings.
[37:28.65]Dude, Dracula's going to be in the library?
[37:30.07]I'm going to shit my pants if he is.
[37:30.97]Because it's perfectly conserved.
[37:33.12]It often appears swollen by the blood it has absorbed.
[37:38.46]Do vampires really exist?
[37:44.02]Okay.
[37:45.62]Yes.
[37:47.59]We did this already.
[37:48.29]Take a look at this book.
[37:50.20]Wow, look at this.
[37:50.88]The Lords of Twilight.
[37:53.70]That was crazy.
[37:54.50]What an awesome book that was.
[37:55.70]Now what?
[37:56.56]Mm-hmm.
[37:57.37]Yep.
[38:00.73]Good.
[38:01.05]Okay.
[38:03.83]Let's exhaust all the dialog.
[38:05.37]He's so angry.
[38:06.32]No, I'm angry at that one guy that said, I don't know Latin, so I'm stupid.
[38:18.79]And it's just like, bro, what the fuck?
[38:20.89]Come on!
[38:23.47]You got one guy.
[38:27.94]Whatever.
[38:28.90]It worked.
[38:34.35]You're still thinking about that guy.
[38:40.60]Alright, hold on.
[38:44.64]Hey, hey, hey.
[38:49.00]This page reveals the origin of the... Give me the answers.
[38:51.84]I don't care.
[38:52.82]Give me all the answers.
[38:53.45]Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo.
[38:56.53]The event that would submerge the world in horror had been announced... Really?
[39:01.39]This page?
[39:01.83]Forget the direction you ordinarily read in.
[39:04.44]Try to compose words... Oh.
[39:06.12]Okay, he did it.
[39:07.68]Exactly.
[39:08.96]The prophecy contains two other terms that cross the first one.
[39:12.83]Look for them... Okay.
[39:15.37]Look.
[39:16.05]Wait.
[39:25.27]Okay.
[39:34.74]Good.
[39:34.86]Thanks.
[39:35.02]Good.
[39:35.34]E. Ove.
[39:45.03]I can't.
[39:48.01]I can't.
[39:48.75]I can't.
[39:51.91]Got it.
[39:53.79]Very odd.
[39:55.02]I grant you that.
[39:59.00]Uh-huh.
[40:08.18]Got it.
[40:29.14]There's the date!
[40:38.00]There is- Why is she not talking?
[40:42.39]She should be talking, right?
[40:52.41]So now everything is clear.
[40:54.47]At the instigation of the Thule Society, evil will triumph in Germany in 1936.
[40:59.72]And there will be massacres.
[41:01.81]So this prophecy is at the root of your mistrust.
[41:05.48]It's just one element among many others.
[41:07.78]Believe me, those people have no notion of compassion.
[41:17.20]Okay.
[41:18.80]Sure.
[41:23.30]Absolutely.
[41:30.95]Sacraments.
[41:31.57]Seven stages.
[41:34.06]Path of the Dragon.
[41:36.02]In a document.
[41:38.70]Good.
[41:39.54]We already did this!
[41:45.02]Excellent memory.
[41:46.62]It is indeed a copy.
[41:48.11]We already did this.
[41:50.67]Yes, the differences.
[41:51.97]Here's the difference right here.
[41:57.19]That is not the required action.
[42:02.92]What are you talking about, dude?
[42:07.64]In the original painting, the angel on the left holds two chalices.
[42:11.71]Sure does.
[42:12.41]To be sure.
[42:13.33]I remember that very well.
[42:14.69]Mm-hmm.
[42:19.30]There's another one.
[42:22.18]Uh-huh.
[42:27.25]It's right here?
[42:34.68]Herman?
[42:50.03]Okay.
[42:51.57]Herman?
[42:52.11]Herman was convinced that the variations in the documents revealed the secrets of the path.
[43:06.66]Imagine yourself as a copyist, seeking to transmit a message to initiates.
[43:11.88]fighting ghosts in the chat about how I was too dumb to do the puzzle and it was the game was just broken or more subtly you remove one the chalice yes it's absent from the copy and I think it's a way to draw attention to it the devil leaves his signature in its absence herman said then the chalice is important
[43:32.26]Okay.
[43:32.95]I'm starting to feel bad for you.
[43:42.48]Don't.
[43:42.70]I'm fine.
[43:43.70]Your ego wouldn't let you... Kind of true.
[43:51.76]My ego wouldn't let me give up, even if... Okay, so you guys are saying it was broken.
[43:57.29]I was just like, I have to figure this out because my ego got in the way.
[44:01.92]I mean, there is some truth to that.
[44:03.75]I will say there is truth to that statement.
[44:06.36]Because I was like, there's no way it's broken.
[44:10.95]But I guess it was.
[44:12.03]Okay.
[44:14.49]if you want to transmit forbidden knowledge it's an advantage to plagiarize sacred art okay will be piously conserved by simple folk who don't even suspect what you've hidden there professor I don't want to take up too much of your time this visit was most interesting damn it even if I must admit your opinions hardly go in the sense my hierarchy expected
[44:37.03]It's regrettable that the Catholic Church is so rigid.
[44:40.13]Oh, can I use your phone?
[44:41.14]The existence of vampires may be doubted.
[44:42.68]The existence of the Thule Society... I'm finishing the rest of this blanket if he says that.
[44:47.06]Beware of it, Father.
[44:48.55]I'll gather some documents that will show you all of the malevolence of this organization.
[44:53.11]Where can I send them to you?
[44:54.87]At the Vlado Vista Inn, if you'd be so kind.
[44:57.08]No, I don't want to go back to the inn.
[44:57.96]Thank you for receiving me so graciously, Professor.
[45:00.42]I wish you a safe journey back to Transylvania, Father.
[45:03.39]I'll keep you.
[45:04.39]would have rather that been a phone call what an astonishing conversation this was in mod chat this was in mod chat this was literally in mod chat they were like I don't know how you get here but you're supposed to get here to know his opinion that's awesome okay we gotta talk to herman we're gonna get back oh my god dude
[45:45.95]I'm so annoyed right now.
[45:48.51]That could have happened 27 minutes ago.
[46:00.10]Alright, back to the inn.
[46:02.13]Save the game here.
[46:09.12]Okay.
[46:10.70]Hey, we're back.
[46:15.43]Check the mail.
[46:20.91]I told you, we're not stopping.
[46:21.73]I'm not turning the stream off until we see Dracula.
[46:24.72]It could be... It could be 12 hours.
[46:26.76]I don't care.
[46:30.65]Oh, wait.
[46:30.93]I gotta...
[46:39.80]Who's this guy?
[46:42.46]Huh?
[46:49.94]Is he drinking?
[46:53.70]Oh, I thought that was like a bag with like booze in it.
[46:59.95]Yes, I'm very good.
[47:02.57]But since Ariel left, I have no one left to play with.
[47:06.50]I can play.
[47:06.74]Oh, can two play that?
[47:08.38]Of course.
[47:09.94]There are different rules, but what I prefer is playing against the wall.
[47:15.03]Explain it to me.
[47:16.35]Each player throws his disk.
[47:18.65]The one who arrives the closest to the wall without touching it wins the point.
[47:23.64]The first one to get two points wins the game.
[47:26.79]And if you hit the wall?
[47:28.80]That's bad luck.
[47:30.34]You lose the point immediately.
[47:32.49]Okay, don't hit the wall.
[47:33.01]Got it.
[47:33.19]Even if the other guy hasn't played yet.
[47:35.55]Got it.
[47:35.71]Oh, then the one who plays second has an advantage.
[47:39.32]For sure.
[47:40.54]That's why we draw lots the first time.
[47:43.34]Then it's always... I don't want to ask this kid any of this.
[47:50.61]Do you want to?
[47:51.44]Let's play discs.
[47:52.04]Great!
[47:53.34]But usually grown-ups aren't interested in playing discs.
[47:58.16]Alright, let's go.
[48:02.63]Good flip.
[48:06.37]I'll take heads.
[48:08.64]Are we putting money on this?
[48:15.26]How much are we putting on this?
[48:20.03]This is a phenomenal throw.
[48:20.99]Okay.
[48:21.81]Click on the disk and keep the left button of the mouse pressed.
[48:28.99]Okay, well, you... Let me click out of the dialog box.
[48:39.95]I got it.
[48:44.98]I got it.
[48:54.99]What are you doing?
[48:55.87]Restart.
[48:59.00]Can you even get closer than the kid just got?
[49:10.07]You're losing to a Victorian orphan kid.
[49:16.22]Who spends every waking moment of his life throwing discs at a wall.
[49:20.38]Okay?
[49:21.36]I'm a journalist.
[49:22.34]I'm a scientist.
[49:23.54]I'm a priest.
[49:24.22]I'm a doctor.
[49:24.89]I've got a lot of shit to do every day.
[49:26.79]So, okay.
[49:27.73]That's fine.
[49:29.29]Ooh, too bad, kid.
[49:33.74]Got it in the bag.
[49:42.15]Done.
[49:53.32]Excellent.
[49:54.74]You're really in the game now.
[49:56.96]In any case, it's fantastic to play with someone who handles stuff so well.
[50:00.53]What do you know about Dracula?
[50:01.75]Now, I'd like to show you my treasures.
[50:04.41]Look in my bag.
[50:09.80]Oh, dude's got tons of stuff in here.
[50:11.32]A silver needle?
[50:16.25]Take it.
[50:16.95]I'll give it to you.
[50:19.19]Trade for it.
[50:21.41]That doesn't look like berries.
[50:28.84]Hey, the Bible!
[50:45.93]The Bible, kid!
[50:47.18]That's my sling.
[50:48.08]Yes, I don't.
[50:48.87]I don't.
[50:50.45]I see you like music.
[50:53.13]I found that in the attic of a demolished house.
[50:57.55]Why would he need a slingshot?
[50:58.93]I don't know.
[50:59.27]He picked up these bright pebbles near a waterfall.
[51:02.78]Defend himself?
[51:03.60]I don't know.
[51:06.68]Just be like Bart Simpson people.
[51:08.84]If somebody's trying to like attack him or like a fucking wild hog.
[51:13.07]I don't know.
[51:13.89]Who knows?
[51:16.85]Okay.
[51:21.88]Well, I got a silver needle.
[51:29.10]Alright, let's go back here.
[51:30.24]See if there's any mail.
[51:32.17]Go talk to the headset dent guy in the inn.
[51:37.17]High FPS is probably bugging the game.
[51:47.06]You need to cap your frame rate if it happens again.
[51:53.89]Got it.
[51:54.99]Alright, I got a lot of shit to talk to you.
[52:03.72]Headset dent guy.
[52:07.95]You see?
[52:08.37]Are you ready to help me at last?
[52:10.49]When do we leave for Turkey?
[52:11.83]I don't think that my superiors would appreciate that initiative.
[52:15.40]However, I promise that I'll think about it.
[52:19.58]Very well.
[52:21.00]I think I'll have to venture onto the path of the dragon alone.
[52:24.53]This guy's dead.
[52:26.27]This guy's dead.
[52:27.09]He's going to be... Okay, you know in RPGs, when you go into a dungeon, and there's usually a singular skeleton somewhere right into the entrance...
[52:37.92]He's gonna be that guy.
[52:39.26]He's gonna be the RPG first cave skeleton on the ground.
[52:47.09]Okay.
[52:48.68]He used to correspond regularly with Martha before the war.
[52:52.33]He didn't believe in vampires.
[52:54.03]He looks like a Candyland character to represent... Wafers?
[52:58.78]It was during the war that she understood the truth.
[53:04.00]He actually does.
[53:05.39]He does look like Candyland's wafer fucking representative.
[53:13.02]That was a good one.
[53:14.78]Actually a good one.
[53:18.09]I better get my head bitten off by Dracula.
[53:26.50]There better be a cutscene where my head is removed from my shoulders by him biting it off and swallowing it.
[53:38.87]I just want to make sure I don't miss anything here.
[53:50.77]Yeah, and I want to hear that... That's like the scream that has to happen.
[54:01.73]Or I'm going to refund the game.
[54:04.05]Martha said it was the only way to discover objects and symbols related to each trial.
[54:09.78]She added that without that knowledge... Alright, get out of here.
[54:14.79]Candyland motherfucker.
[54:18.01]Hello?
[54:18.51]Telephone call!
[54:24.42]I'd like to talk to, uh, Herman.
[54:43.30]Gotta go talk to the other guy that's up at the ruins.
[54:56.68]Why's it doing this?
[54:58.36]Oh, that's normal.
[55:01.09]Alright bro, I found out a lot of shit.
[55:08.80]Hello, Father Arnold.
[55:10.54]Are you back from Budapest?
[55:11.98]Just this afternoon.
[55:13.04]I spoke at length with Professor Boxoff.
[55:15.49]She takes testimony about vampirism very seriously.
[55:21.36]Age makes many academics lose touch with reality.
[55:25.32]But it wasn't necessary.
[55:26.76]I was able to procure a printed edition, which... Okay.
[55:32.59]Uh... The Thule Society.
[55:35.08]You know I'm not very interested in esotericism.
[55:39.21]Is this a game you'd see on those TV menu restaurants?
[55:44.09]What?
[55:46.64]Alright, what's the over-under of a bare-ass Dracula in this one as well?
[56:00.40]Don't spoil it.
[56:03.28]Do we?
[56:03.68]Do you think we're going to see Dracula's bare ass in this?
[56:06.56]He made them labor naked on the enlargement of his castle till they died of exhaustion.
[56:11.35]I think he's gonna get, like, resurrected, and he's gonna stand up, and he's gonna be nude, and there'll be a back-behind shot of his bare ass.
[56:17.09]You know what I mean?
[56:19.28]Like, it's Path of the Dragon.
[56:20.22]Like, we're getting, like, a resurrection thing potentially here.
[56:22.54]Vlad was acting for the best.
[56:24.86]That's one view of things.
[56:31.48]It's a journey of initiation that some traditions associate with Vlad Tepes.
[56:37.03]Most likely because Vlad was called Dracula.
[56:40.34]Which means the dragon or the devil.
[56:44.84]Okay, so we did this.
[56:46.02]Okay.
[56:46.96]So I talked to both of them.
[56:52.17]Now I have to... I have this needle.
[56:57.70]This is done.
[56:58.22]This is good.
[57:02.74]Now I have to call Von Krueger.
[57:07.06]Okay.
[57:07.18]I figured.
[57:19.54]What is wrong with y'all?
[57:28.59]Okay.
[57:29.96]I'd like to... Now will he be available?
[57:35.09]No.
[57:38.41]What was the other number I had to call?
[57:42.76]Kruger?
[57:45.12]Yep, we got him.
[57:53.31]Okay, uh, let's just go through them all.
[57:59.42]The lava lamp is going to be perfect in like five minutes.
[58:04.38]Oh yeah.
[58:09.01]Yep, the P-Syndrome.
[58:11.91]Okay.
[58:18.83]Do vampires exist?
[58:33.66]Where's the bush light?
[58:37.04]I covered this at the beginning of the stream.
[58:38.41]Unfortunately, no bush light tonight.
[58:40.09]It was very hot.
[58:42.01]It's very hot out today in Vegas.
[58:44.02]I opted for a vodka cranberry.
[58:46.24]And I did go through this one very fast.
[58:49.87]So we're going to make another one a little bit later.
[58:57.64]I was, I was drinking it like it was like a regular just soda because I was just totally, I was, I was, I was on the chat earlier.
[59:09.29]Okay.
[59:12.63]That's Dracula code.
[59:13.49]I figured it kind of looked like blood.
[59:14.63]So it was like Dracula.
[59:16.43]You don't have any allergies, do you?
[59:18.50]No, not at all.
[59:20.20]Good.
[59:21.28]Well, I, I don't think there's anything to worry about, but call me if you notice any allergic reactions.
[59:30.68]Okay.
[59:31.98]Unfortunately, yes.
[59:33.68]Bad book.
[59:34.08]You're too severe.
[59:35.61]I won't tell you what I think.
[59:36.75]Let's see.
[59:37.69]Stoker affirms that those who die as victims of a vampire should become one in turn.
[59:42.39]So at that rate... Double-cupping the vodka crayon is gangster?
[59:45.78]...with a growth rate faster than Sibonacci's famous immortal sequence.
[59:50.46]In a first stage, all of mankind would be vampirized.
[59:53.52]Do you think that's either and cool?
[59:55.48]The vampires would also disappear, not having any victims left to feed on.
[60:00.04]So Stoker's hypothesis is therefore perfectly absurd.
[60:03.95]No species can live without regulation.
[60:11.22]Yeah, I noticed they coincided with epidemics of the plague.
[60:15.04]Masses of people died.
[60:16.55]They were buried quickly, and sometimes when they were still alive, they torrent themselves.
[60:21.99]Did I give this game a zero point?
[60:23.04]I've been given 0.0s out recently.
[60:25.14]Is that bad?
[60:26.36]Bodies were found bloodied.
[60:27.84]In short, they made perfect vampires.
[60:31.29]Cases of premature burial like that aren't uncommon, you know.
[60:34.79]Even today, a colleague told me... I gave it a 0.0.
[60:38.96]I did.
[60:39.60]Yeah.
[60:40.38]The poor lady died of suffocation.
[60:41.98]It's because you're upset.
[60:46.74]Decomposition is not a very systematic phenomenon.
[60:51.10]How many points will Dracula's ass raise this?
[60:53.18]If we see Dracula's bare ass, this will go up to a 55.
[60:57.11]It's still an F. And you'll always find one pseudo-vampire.
[61:01.13]Anyway, why associate the absence of decomposition with vampirism?
[61:05.74]The phenomenon has been observed with many holy figures.
[61:09.00]For example,
[61:11.63]Somebody said, why are we listening to Dr. Evil?
[61:13.61]Yep.
[61:14.23]There's so much dialog.
[61:21.42]Alright.
[61:22.58]What is the important dialog?
[61:25.26]At this rate, this phone call would be like 50,000 fucking US dollars.
[61:29.16]This is an expensive phone call.
[61:30.29]Back in the day, you had to get what you wanted out quick.
[61:34.31]Himmel, esotericism, secret societies, initiatory journeys.
[61:40.05]What an old-fashioned hodgepodge.
[61:43.28]We couldn't sit and talk for 30 minutes.
[61:53.86]Decomposition produces gases that can give the cadaver a swollen aspect.
[61:59.38]The liquid that oozes from corpses is an odd phenomenon, but... Yeah, long-distance phone calls... Okay, if we're talking like 30 years ago, 40 years ago...
[62:10.69]What was it like fucking $10 a minute to call like fucking Budapest from the US?
[62:18.16]It was something crazy.
[62:25.97]What exactly did the professor say?
[62:28.39]Great evil will come forth in Germany in some 15 years.
[62:31.67]Do you think this takes place 40 years ago?
[62:33.04]This takes place in like 1914.
[62:35.64]It'd be even more expensive.
[62:38.80]Alright, this guy eventually is going to have to go like this.
[62:57.60]He's going to get his copy of his book to read it to me over the phone.
[63:03.16]And look.
[63:07.95]Hey, look, it didn't take me long to find something.
[63:11.59]0.0.
[63:12.81]But I'll leave you the pleasure of the hunt.
[63:21.08]This is this is 0.0.
[63:32.15]Why am I not getting?
[63:33.43]Yeah, it's not it's not telling me that ads are coming or anything.
[63:38.27]My dashboard is like fucking bright.
[63:42.46]That's a good place to take a break.
[63:43.71]I'm going to get another drink.
[63:44.65]That's unbelievable.
[63:45.73]I'll be back.
[63:46.92]See you guys in like two minutes.
[70:18.36]Okay, I'm back.
[70:20.90]And funny how he... funny how he's able to send me this word search over the telephone.
[70:43.40]Is that not correct?
[70:49.48]Okay, how come I can't do this one?
[71:06.68]By the way, uh, I have some very bad news for everybody here.
[71:13.13]Do you want me to say it?
[71:20.46]I have been made aware.
[71:26.71]I've been given some information.
[71:30.35]Dracula?
[71:32.59]Ain't even in the fucking game!
[71:39.30]Dracula's not in the fucking game!
[71:55.21]I was told by a very close source hey I know you're like doing this thing where like you want to see Dracula but like I do you want me to tell you something very very very important uh I I I don't know how much longer the game is
[72:24.87]We need to finish this.
[72:29.08]Apparently, spoiler alert, Dracula the guy, apparently it's like a one of those, hey, the movie's about to end.
[72:42.05]Remember this guy?
[72:42.83]And I think it's not, it's like you see him for like a half a second.
[72:55.97]So, here's what... So I just threw an hour of this stream in the fucking trash.
[73:03.32]Alright, well, I had fun.
[73:04.58]I had fun fucking around.
[73:06.69]Alright, so here's what I want to do.
[73:08.65]I'm going to keep going.
[73:14.59]But there's a lot of games.
[73:15.36]I got a lot of games to play.
[73:16.12]Don't worry.
[73:18.10]I don't think this is a bear ass.
[73:22.28]Secret societies.
[73:24.27]Initiatory journeys.
[73:26.20]But, uh, no, there is no Dracula 4.
[73:33.68]I think this is like the trilogy.
[73:36.76]And then I think there's other ones after this.
[73:47.93]There is a Dracula 4.
[73:49.22]Okay.
[73:53.38]Uh, alright.
[73:56.49]I'm gonna hang this phone up.
[73:58.33]We're gonna see what the next area is.
[74:01.17]And then I'm gonna probably pivot to something else.
[74:08.84]There's a timecode on this video if you wanna just see Dracula.
[74:12.92]I don't care.
[74:13.59]I wanna see it.
[74:14.99]Should I just put it on stream?
[74:30.84]Alright, alright, alright.
[74:33.47]We're about a fourth of the way through the walkthrough.
[74:35.51]Hey, this might be like a fun detective game.
[74:37.81]This might be a fun experience.
[74:41.64]I want to fight like Dracula and his minions and shit.
[74:51.45]I think I'm throwing this one into the no container.
[74:56.66]And we're going to do something else.
[75:00.85]Um, I'm gonna, let's spoil the whole game.
[75:04.05]Uh, let's get it on screen.
[75:05.57]Give me one second.
[75:07.21]Uh, this apparently is the only time you see Dracula in the whole game.
[75:11.22]So, let's see.
[75:12.96]This is what I wanted to see, and I don't know if I'm willing to put seven and a half hours into seeing this, uh, while we call people on the phone and do word searches.
[75:23.67]This is, I would call this a rage quit, I would.
[75:27.07]You're absolutely correct.
[75:29.96]Alright, so here is... Here, let me open it.
[75:38.10]Let's see if this would have been worth it.
[75:39.91]So I want you all to sit here and tell me if this would have been worth it to you.
[75:44.49]Or me, right?
[75:45.17]I gotta be honest too.
[75:47.41]Would this have been worth it if we waited to see this?
[75:51.98]And I'm gonna be very, very upfront.
[75:57.26]Okay, hold on a second.
[76:02.20]Here we go.
[76:02.77]Alright, you ready?
[76:04.54]We're spoiling Dracula 3.
[76:07.11]I hope you're aware of that.
[76:08.46]Everyone's aware of that.
[76:35.43]What to do now?
[76:37.41]My God, guide me.
[76:42.20]When you explode, do you blow his coffin up?
[76:45.29]Oh, come on, man.
[76:46.11]You don't blow his coffin up?
[76:57.87]I saw the dynamite in the... That's it?
[77:12.66]Wait, this isn't him?
[77:16.76]What are we doing?
[77:18.44]What is- who is this guy?
[77:19.99]Oh, the berries!
[77:24.37]The berries from the beginning of the game!
[77:33.38]Wait, other one, other one.
[77:34.48]Wrong time code?
[77:36.91]Who are we killing in here?
[77:38.43]Okay, wait.
[77:39.07]Wrong time code.
[77:40.63]That was wrong?
[77:41.37]That was just a guy.
[77:42.52]That was just some guy.
[77:44.96]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[77:46.36]This is apparently Dracula.
[77:49.91]Okay, hold on.
[77:58.52]This is a different crypt.
[78:04.93]Dude, come on.
[78:10.27]Here he is.
[78:10.81]My God.
[78:15.24]Approach me very close.
[78:19.43]I'll be able to act.
[78:32.41]Uh-huh.
[78:39.42]This ain't Dracula from the...
[79:01.54]And you end up just talking to his ass.
[79:04.26]You have a in-person phone call with Dracula at the end of this game.
[79:10.01]By the way.
[79:10.73]Perhaps you have spoken well.
[79:13.76]Or perhaps you are already condemned.
[79:17.81]You shall not know until after you satisfy my curiosity.
[79:26.54]Look at the time code.
[79:37.07]Can we kill him?
[79:45.82]I hope he does a word search.
[79:57.59]Don't make a single mistake on this ghastly word search.
[80:03.42]You acted a very different way.
[80:08.09]Twice, your enemy, Janos, was at your mercy and you spared him.
[80:17.67]Why?
[80:24.21]I'd be really disappointed if I got here.
[80:49.81]I'm so glad we just skipped the whole game.
[80:52.52]Yeah, he's teleporting like three yards.
[81:09.27]Somebody said he's only teleporting five yards.
[81:11.19]Yeah, why?
[81:11.57]He's not going far at all.
[81:13.64]You could have just walked over there and it would have been kind of scarier.
[81:23.47]What a strange priest you are.
[81:32.26]Level one blink.
[81:33.90]Men insult you in hushed voices.
[81:38.05]But you hear them, do you not?
[81:42.95]That was a VRJosh special.
[81:45.37]And you see in the dark like a nocturnal beast.
[81:49.98]you are beginning to resemble me priest do you know why I have traveled the path yes as did I before yeah but let us see how far your knowledge stretches will you be able to tell me who initiated me
[82:13.35]Please do it.
[82:16.28]Please do some trivia.
[82:18.62]Yeah, it's trivia.
[82:21.11]But what if you get it wrong?
[82:24.90]You have spoken.
[82:26.42]And the words you uttered will determine if you live or if you die.
[82:35.12]I hear your heart beat and your arteries throb.
[82:43.07]It has been a long while since I drank the blood of a priest.
[82:48.68]Do you fear me?
[83:01.06]I sense on you the odor of tears, of sweat, of blood.
[83:07.34]And this is not the Dracula from the first two games.
[83:12.11]He was extravagant and eccentric.
[83:14.49]This is like a completely different guy.
[83:17.23]The absurd idea of fighting me.
[83:24.28]Good answer.
[83:27.22]What is it?
[83:29.74]Why is it so loud?
[83:31.34]This is the menu music.
[83:37.05]To your hands, Lord, I entrust my soul.
[84:00.61]That is... That is not... That looks like fucking Ursula.
[84:14.77]That did... Like... Not Ursula.
[84:17.38]It looked like the thing that Ursula turns people into.
[84:20.62]We'll never reach the crypts.
[84:22.38]Don't talk that way, Beckermeyer.
[84:25.94]What the fuck dude?
[84:45.43]Oh my god.
[85:01.12]What is going on?
[85:03.81]Post-credits explosion scene?
[85:13.25]Dracula started World War II.
[85:19.38]Huh?
[85:19.90]Wait, what?
[85:38.50]The game is up.
[85:39.99]You're a spy in the Third Reich.
[85:42.41]What the fuck?
[85:43.29]In August 1941, you left England carrying secret documents, which were stolen, needless to say, and met Heinrich von Kruger.
[85:54.97]A few weeks later, this same Kruger was in Romania, in your company, where you both participated in a top secret mission.
[86:06.09]Operation D. You seem to know.
[86:09.60]Dracula.
[86:12.60]Captain Cunningham.
[86:14.39]Oh, God.
[86:15.35]But what we don't know is the nature of Operation D. You will give us an explanation, I trust.
[86:25.02]Skipping was the right call.
[86:26.59]I think it was.
[86:27.63]I had to make a decision.
[86:30.05]Vlad Tepes.
[86:31.39]Dracula.
[86:32.50]The vampire.
[86:34.09]You don't believe in vampires, Captain?
[86:38.13]If you had seen what I have seen, you would know that I am in deadly earnest.
[86:53.07]Why is this guy here first?
[86:54.95]Do you know what I mean?
[86:55.51]Like, write that cutscene, Hens.
[86:56.74]I don't know if you put this guy here first.
[87:01.68]It's a little too... That was extremes.
[87:06.99]Okay.
[87:09.77]Well, that was Dracula 3.
[87:13.64]And I'm sorry for those of you that wanted to see Dracula 3 in its entirety, but that just was not going to happen.
[87:23.35]When I got hit with that word search over the telephone, that was it.
[87:26.09]That was the end of the game for me.
[87:29.44]So TL;DR, Dracula doesn't show up until the last two minutes of the game.
[87:34.53]He literally just stands around.
[87:35.75]You blow him up with dynamite.
[87:37.67]He flies out completely unscathed while you are dead because you blew yourself up with dynamite and he gets away and starts World War II.
[87:47.51]Okay.
[87:49.45]We just saved ourselves five to six hours of phone calls.
[87:55.48]Okay, so moving on.
[87:57.82]I got a lot of other stuff to play.
[88:03.68]This guy's like, oh, this is awkward.
[88:07.94]So you skip to the end of the game?
[88:12.53]Oh.
[88:15.00]So you know, like, everything?
[88:17.06]Do you know everything, everything?
[88:19.20]Yeah, we know everything.
[88:20.20]Oh, I've just been on the phone this whole time.
[88:23.81]They call it expressionism.
[88:26.47]But for me... Ugh.
[88:32.25]Alright, these are the horror games I got.
[88:34.45]I want to play them.
[88:35.53]There's a couple that are in particular.
[88:37.23]I even have other Dracula games, by the way.
[88:41.84]Give me one second while I load it up.
[88:45.41]But yeah, we're going to pivot from this.
[88:47.85]Hey, at least we got to see the first act of Dracula 3.
[88:51.56]It's all good.
[88:53.22]Goodbye, Professor.
[88:53.96]Goodbye.
[88:56.04]See you later, Professor.
[89:02.30]Okay.
