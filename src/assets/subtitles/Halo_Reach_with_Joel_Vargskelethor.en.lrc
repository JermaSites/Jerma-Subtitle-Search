[00:03.21]Hey!
[00:04.63]What's up?
[00:06.05]Computers are difficult.
[00:07.79]Computers are hard to use.
[00:10.23]We're connecting across the whole world to each other, alright?
[00:14.71]First of all, we had to get... Listen.
[00:16.77]Hold on.
[00:17.05]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:18.11]Everyone slow down.
[00:20.92]We had to get our Xbox Live accounts to go through Steam to connect to the Microsoft servers to then add somebody through Steam to then connect through Steam through the Microsoft Xbox servers to play Halo Ridge.
[00:33.15]It's 2019.
[00:33.85]We're still doing this shit?
[00:42.39]It's 2000.
[00:43.56]It's almost 2020.
[00:44.28]And we're still doing this.
[00:52.74]Traffic was fucking slow.
[00:56.48]But anyways, today... Welcome, everybody.
[01:03.77]Got something special for you today.
[01:07.29]Joel and I are going to be playing Halo Reach Co-op Legendary difficulty.
[01:16.46]That's right.
[01:18.64]That's what you're here for.
[01:20.56]That's why you showed up.
[01:26.60]On Legendary.
[01:28.04]That's right.
[01:33.81]Should be fun.
[01:36.29]We are currently... We tried to set this up, and there's a lot of random things that go into setting this up.
[01:44.71]Because it's all peer-to-peer.
[01:47.20]So, you'll see.
[01:49.50]You'll see.
[01:50.82]This is a you'll see scenario.
[01:55.54]But we're going to do squad stream, and when Joel's... I think Joel's doing his intro now, too.
[02:03.29]You'll see.
[02:04.35]P2P Omega Lull.
[02:07.25]P pants to P pants.
[02:10.18]Yes, no.
[02:10.72]P to pants is what it is.
[02:16.10]P to pants.
[02:21.32]And they got like seven of these coming out, don't they?
[02:28.43]This is like Halo.
[02:29.63]This is not even Halo 1.
[02:33.05]This is Halo 0.
[02:33.87]If you don't know how this works.
[02:38.87]This is Halo 0.
[02:39.39]Well, this technically is Halo 1, right?
[02:44.29]Halo 1 is... Halo 2?
[02:47.19]Or something?
[02:47.77]It's a prequel.
[02:48.31]Yeah, right.
[02:50.93]Let me, uh, let me ping him.
[02:52.17]Let's see.
[02:52.71]What's the deal?
[02:53.68]Let's see.
[02:54.02]He's gonna say... Oh, I think he is doing his intro.
[02:59.96]Alright, so...
[03:01.88]Uh, yeah, we're gonna play this.
[03:03.18]I have to make a tweet, too.
[03:05.92]Oh, ping him.
[03:06.76]Oh, I'm just gonna ping him.
[03:09.60]That's the professional term.
[03:12.00]Guys, we've never played a game on this channel with Joel before.
[03:16.41]I gotta use the professional terms.
[03:17.67]I'm gonna ping him.
[03:20.43]I'll get right on that.
[03:21.83]You know what I mean?
[03:26.15]Let's see if we can lock this down.
[03:27.71]Right?
[03:27.93]Shhh!
[03:38.19]I'm currently typing.
[03:43.77]I'm going to say, come on in.
[03:49.15]Oh, here we go.
[03:51.89]Let me tweet.
[03:52.37]I'll be right there.
[03:53.62]Stay tuned for Halo Reach.
[03:56.86]And make sure you go to Burger King.
[04:00.46]Just for no reason.
[04:02.28]Okay, I'm sorry.
[04:03.18]I panicked.
[04:41.46]Have you guys heard about Raid Shadow Legends?
[04:47.99]Let me call them.
[04:49.57]Here we go.
[04:50.11]Okay.
[04:52.99]Okay.
[04:53.27]New friend, okay?
[04:55.93]So...
[05:07.83]hello hey hey is it working yeah let's go ahead and lock this down alright um I was just talking about this but uh uh we uh we used to play a lot of halo together me and Jerma uh I don't know if you guys are familiar with x2 clan uh that was us back in 2009 uh you know and we didn't know each other we didn't know each other we thought um
[05:29.99]we had played, or rather, you know, when I discovered that Jerema was DPP on Feed Farm Exploit, I... PPP?
[05:44.61]No, which one was it?
[05:46.87]PPP?
[05:48.95]No, no.
[05:50.09]Back before they reinstated the server fix on the KDR stuff.
[05:56.34]Oh, no.
[05:57.10]That was bullshit.
[05:58.48]Do you remember the ghost cycling they did?
[06:00.86]I got on the top of the leaderboards from that.
[06:02.73]And I'm sorry.
[06:04.35]If you're realizing an exploit doesn't count, please.
[06:08.25]They left it in the game.
[06:09.95]That was before QQ recycling, I think.
[06:13.11]Yeah, that's before I cleared out my recycling bin, so... That was CCC... There was a lot of shit in there too, there was a ton of stuff in there.
[06:19.33]Yeah, yeah, I agree.
[06:21.23]There was like probably 60 gigs worth of stuff.
[06:23.82]And then I did that and I lost all my fucking exploits.
[06:26.36]Do you know where I got Clan X2 from?
[06:32.67]What is Clan X2?
[06:35.01]I was just thinking of X-Men 2 and the fucking poster.
[06:38.23]I was thinking, what is the most outrageous clan name I can think of?
[06:43.13]X-Men movie poster.
[06:46.66]What the fuck?
[06:48.28]I was just like, what kind of aggressive gamer terminology can I throw at the audience before they're like... Ghost recycling?
[06:58.61]I don't know.
[06:59.07]I don't know any real gaming terminology.
[07:01.45]I'm just like...
[07:02.75]Yeah, stats and exploits and... Ghost recycling.
[07:07.49]I don't fucking know.
[07:10.05]Well, anyway, so... Anyway, legendary.
[07:15.50]Yeah, we're going to do this on Legendary because we're big boys.
[07:18.96]That's right.
[07:20.55]We did play a lot of Halo back in the day.
[07:22.48]We actually really did.
[07:23.62]That's not even a joke.
[07:24.50]Everyone thinks it's the first time you guys have hung out.
[07:26.76]No, no, no, no, no.
[07:29.36]I threw a guy at work.
[07:31.34]I actually met Joel a long, long fucking time ago.
[07:34.72]And a lot of people don't actually know this.
[07:37.45]But I've known you since we were like, what, 15?
[07:40.75]Yeah.
[07:42.15]no we we went to high school together man we went we took uh theater together just go from another made-up story to another made-up story
[08:01.15]I was gonna cover the story how you're like you smash your niece or something like that and I was gonna fuck with you and just be like this is before you your name was like Biffy Nobody knows it's real on these channels anymore.
[08:18.66]Is your squad stream working?
[08:21.08]I think so, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:22.00]Alright, guys, by the way, this is a squad stream, so you got two streams open potentially.
[08:27.46]Let's get an evite going.
[08:28.82]How do you invite me?
[08:31.26]Hang on, let me see.
[08:33.67]So yeah, but for real though, we sat around here and not to imply that we didn't just do something that was real, but the brass tacks of it is that we set up the Master Chief Collection here and it just came out and
[08:48.88]Yeah, you know, not to poo-poo on a game that is so beloved by both of us, but the problem about it is that the UI is, like, fucking horrible.
[08:58.04]Because they're using Xbox Live.
[08:59.60]Yeah.
[09:00.80]And, you know... Through Microsoft.
[09:03.67]Yeah.
[09:04.25]Back to Steam.
[09:05.15]Back to you.
[09:07.19]Back to me.
[09:08.37]Back to Steam.
[09:10.37]And then we have to... What's the point of the Xbox account?
[09:13.81]Is what I don't understand.
[09:16.12]If you can invite somebody through Steam, what's the point of the Xbox?
[09:18.82]Just to, like, track your achievements or something?
[09:23.02]The Steam achievements.
[09:23.80]Are there Steam achievements for this game?
[09:25.20]If there is, then I'm gonna laugh.
[09:27.38]Are there Steam achievements for this game?
[09:30.76]Well, back in the day... Back in the day, uh... God.
[09:38.02]me and uh what was your name again what's my name oh um it's uh tended d ragoon 74 so so me and and and tended raccoon back in the day this is before the accident of course uh we used to be known as the chivo hunters uh nothing to do with the achievement hunter but we used to collect chivos on on Xbox live and uh you know
[10:06.33]Dude, there's 700 Steam achievements.
[10:09.01]How do you even make that many achievements?
[10:10.79]Is this game, like, 600 hours long?
[10:13.41]How are there 700 Steam achievements?
[10:17.38]Alright.
[10:18.02]Let's see if we can mic you here.

[10:51.49]It's great.
[10:54.61]And I remember it fondly.
[10:57.71]There's something you guys don't know, though.
[10:59.07]There's something you don't know.
[11:01.33]We know something you don't know about our connection.
[11:04.58]It's bad.
[11:06.76]That's it.
[11:07.02]Nah!
[11:10.44]No, because, um... Uh, somebody else is in the game.

[13:03.78]We, uh...
[13:05.68]You know, we sat around for probably approximately an hour off stream, just bashing our heads together, but this is like oddly deja vu, a thing that I experienced like five minutes ago.
[13:17.40]So, you know.
[13:19.32]Imagine setting up like a stream for like 45 minutes before the stream and it still has problems.
[13:25.00]This happens on every like multiplayer game.
[13:29.50]Alright, we'll do, uh... I was joking with Jeremy, like, if this doesn't work out, let's just, like, go on, like, a Super Nintendo emulator and, like, hook up fucking, like, Bomberman and play that instead.
[13:41.45]I'll just come over your house.
[13:43.77]Okay.
[13:46.34]I'll take the Elon Musk fucking under the Earth tunnel and I'll be there in, like, 40 minutes.
[13:51.49]People keep joining my fucking lobby.
[13:52.82]I don't know how to, like, close up the lobby.
[13:54.48]It's like a bleeding wound.
[13:58.58]People keep fucking joining.
[13:59.70]I don't know what to do.

[15:11.51]This is way harder than the game.

[15:15.13]Alright, hang on.
[15:15.67]Uh...
[15:17.08]But I can't invite you now, what the fuck?

[15:29.76]But guys, guys, this is all a meta joke.
[15:32.58]You see, we set this up to be as hard as possible because we know that true gamers recognize skill.
[15:39.30]And tonight we're gonna show you that not only are we the master of overcoming challenges, but we're also the master of halos.

[17:51.20]You know, now you're all familiar with our content, and this should be no surprise that we will be doing this on Legendary.
[17:59.78]We might do the extra DP levels afterwards, but right now, we're going to be focusing on solo right now.
[18:05.21]We're going to find all the secret tokens.

[18:38.77]Look, I got a question.
[18:39.80]I know absolutely, I mean, all jokes aside, I have no fucking idea what any of the stuff on the screen is.
[18:47.50]Is it like the Star Wars Stormtroopers where there's a bunch of Master Chiefs and then there's... Is that how it works?
[18:55.39]Is everybody dressed like that?
[18:57.93]Okay, dude.
[18:59.05]Hang on.

[19:37.25]So that's our new number six.
[19:38.75]So that's Master Chief.
[19:57.69]Chat, I gotta ask you a serious question here, but how memorable is the mission?
[20:03.56]Because we remember it really well, but I'm asking you guys.
[20:06.57]Not much?
[20:06.89]Very?
[20:14.95]pretty memorable.
[20:16.25]Reach is too damn important.
[20:18.07]You know how people have their FromSoftware list of Dark Souls 1, then Dark Souls 2, then Dark Souls 3.
[20:26.87]Everybody has their own little... Where does Halo Reach sit in the Dark Souls tier list?
[20:31.76]That's Cat, Noble 2, Mule and George, 4 and 5.
[20:35.14]You're riding with me, Noble 6.
[20:36.58]Is Halo Reach the Bloodborne of FromSoftware games, or where does it sit?
[20:40.68]The rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled.
[20:44.53]What's the Dark Souls 2 of Halo?
[20:45.75]What are they saying?
[20:47.56]I mean, I know it's worth it.
[21:02.76]Halo 5 is the Dark Souls 2 FromSoftware games of Microsoft games.
[21:07.09]Cool.
[21:07.69]Dude, if I didn't have fucking brain damage already trying to configure this shit, now I have that.
[21:11.01]This is the Dark Souls of Bloodborne type stranding games.
[21:17.96]What even happened in that cutscene?
[21:19.32]Were you paying any attention at all?
[21:24.12]Um... Things happened and... There was a cutscene and...
[21:35.65]Oh, come on.
[21:38.25]Okay, no, we're fine now.
[21:39.77]We're fine now.
[21:41.03]Somebody just grabbed your internet hose and, like, kinked it for a second.
[21:44.83]Dude, let me tell you something.
[21:46.05]My CPU is, like, made out of, like, silly putty and, like, um... What do you have for a CPU?

[22:53.11]Alright, and investigate the distress beacon.
[22:56.71]Okay, so if you nod up and down, that's you.
[22:59.63]Okay, so what does 117 mean?
[23:02.04]Have we figured that out?
[23:06.46]What is 117?
[23:06.84]Is that our ping?
[23:08.02]We thought it was the ping at first, but you're going to discover soon that it might be more like looking like a telephone number after we reviewed how it looks.
[23:18.89]So we have to investigate the beacon.
[23:20.13]How easy is this game?
[23:21.35]Anybody remember?
[23:23.86]Alright, noble team.
[23:25.12]Okay.
[23:26.34]Watch the approach.
[23:28.46]How did you do emotes?
[23:32.79]It's very hard.
[23:35.09]Is this aim down sights?
[23:38.28]No, it's just standard gamer.
[23:41.20]Alright, I want you guys to experience... Standard gamer.
[23:46.23]I want you to experience how, mamma mia, this fantastic latency between Mexico and Sweden or wherever you live.
[23:55.55]Check this out.
[23:56.27]I'm going to jump.
[23:57.05]Ready?
[24:00.07]It looks great on my end, but not on his end.
[24:03.36]This is my end.
[24:07.71]Do you understand how fucking bad this is?
[24:10.27]It's really bad.
[24:11.35]If you look at his end, it's very, very bad.
[24:14.06]So the training wheels are on.
[24:15.86]You know when people jog and they walk and they have the ankle bracelets and wrist bracelets on?
[24:21.08]That's what this is.
[24:23.12]You know what, though, Jerma?
[24:24.32]You know how much of a gamer I am?
[24:26.80]We wouldn't be playing on Legendary if we weren't gamers.
[24:30.50]Listen, listen.
[24:31.16]Here's why I'm classy.
[24:32.98]You're streaming with a PC.
[24:34.66]I'm using something new.
[24:36.08]I'm using Google Stadia.
[24:37.94]I'm going to show you what latest is all about.
[24:40.39]You know, I was literally trying to figure out what the fuck Stadia is even for.
[24:46.59]I figured it out.
[24:48.65]Do you want to know the secret of what Stadia is for?
[24:51.20]Sloths.
[24:52.22]No, it's for in 20 years when the internet is good enough, like 8G is good enough, they will be the ones that are here.
[25:00.74]It's a long play.
[25:02.04]It's completely worthless right now.
[25:04.28]And it'll be worthless for probably five plus years.
[25:06.66]It is only here for 8G in like 2040.
[25:11.01]So you're saying that that Google start is basically what's that thing?
[25:14.07]We're like people froze themselves down in the 80s a little fall damage, by the way, that's called cryogenic So it's crying cryogenic internet.
[25:23.09]There's the cry engine It's called the cry engine
[25:29.74]Okay, this is... We tried this off a little bit off-string and said, like, this is fine now that I'm actually doing it.
[25:35.99]It's like a fucking nightmare to play.
[25:41.40]I would have been the person with the training wheels on.
[25:45.18]I wish we could switch hosts.
[25:49.25]Let's keep going for a little bit.
[25:50.55]I mean, I can accept this.
[25:52.57]You want to switch levels after this?
[25:54.67]Like, after we do this?
[25:55.65]Oh, yeah, let's do that.
[25:58.17]I'll put the training wheels on.
[25:59.47]I can handle it.
[26:00.15]I think it was a little better on my end.
[26:02.51]When did this game come out again?
[26:06.07]I forget.
[26:06.59]2006.
[26:06.69]No, it didn't.
[26:07.47]Is this gate open?
[26:08.35]2010?
[26:08.37]Well, this is, of course, our 10-year anniversary.
[26:11.19]Don't you remember?
[26:20.83]Oh, fuck, there's like... Are these enemies?
[26:22.04]I don't think those are enemies.
[26:27.42]I saw the radar.
[26:30.04]Happy Thanksgiving, you killed some fucking Mars turkey.
[26:34.95]Alright, where are you?
[26:35.89]Oh, you're the one with the 117, okay.
[26:37.89]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:42.81]Is there friendly fire in this?
[26:44.39]Is there friendly fire?
[26:45.56]Yes.
[26:46.54]Where's my health?
[26:49.42]I think I just murdered you.
[26:50.44]You did, but I respawned.
[26:52.62]But your corpse is still there.
[26:54.28]Wait, hang on.
[26:55.20]You're standing on your corpse.
[26:56.62]Do it again.
[26:58.53]No, no.
[26:58.89]Kill me.
[26:59.83]Kill me, and I'll materialize on top of myself.
[27:02.39]Yes.
[27:02.87]Like an existential crisis.
[27:03.97]We're going to do this until there's 50 corpses.
[27:11.95]Okay, yeah.
[27:12.59]Good.
[27:13.84]So we couldn't get it to deathmatch because it took like 25 minutes to get into a lobby.
[27:18.99]So instead we'll just make a makeshift one right here on the stairs.
[27:21.33]This is not actually gonna work, right?
[27:25.49]There's no way this will work.
[27:26.47]You just fell off the edge.
[27:30.03]Are you dead?
[27:30.49]Tell you what, tell you what, tell you what.
[27:34.41]I'm right behind you.
[27:35.75]Let's jump at the same time.
[27:37.66]This is going to kill the server.
[27:38.82]We're going to have to start the mission over.
[27:41.08]No, no, no.
[27:41.84]I just want to experiment.
[27:42.90]I want to see the falling animation.
[27:45.52]Are you ready to do this?
[27:46.36]Okay, ready?
[27:47.82]Three, two, one, go.
[27:55.54]What?
[27:56.48]Oh.
[27:58.04]No, dude, we have to block a door with our bodies.
[28:02.20]Alright, we have to make a door.
[28:03.35]We have to block this whole door.
[28:05.75]Okay.
[28:06.45]Just kill me.
[28:09.72]I don't- I think the actual bodies are like ragdoll, but- Boot player?
[28:12.66]You- I can boot you from the game.
[28:21.75]Kill me here.
[28:22.55]Kill me, come here.
[28:24.17]I'm gonna boot you from your own hosted game.
[28:27.69]No, this is my game.
[28:29.99]No, I forgive you.
[28:30.91]I don't.
[28:36.10]Wait, don't shoot that guy.
[28:38.41]How many bodies do you think we can actually put here?
[28:40.83]I don't know, but... Keep palling up.
[28:43.15]Shoot me too, man.
[28:43.82]Alright, don't boot me.
[28:46.88]Don't boot me.
[28:49.00]Make sure you stay in the designated body area.
[28:50.60]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[28:52.34]Hang on.
[28:55.16]You don't... What if... You were trade by 10.
[28:57.56]Press X, you're gonna boot this for me.
[28:58.88]No, forgive.
[28:59.30]Forgive.
[29:02.02]Yeah, don't accidentally boot me.
[29:05.69]It's always escape.
[29:07.49]Is anything despawning?
[29:08.39]No, I don't think so.
[29:17.73]Something real bad is in this room.
[29:29.68]Legendary gamers here.
[29:34.08]True, true legendary gamers.
[29:38.29]Let's do this until the server turns off.
[29:42.57]You've heard of those, like, Counter-Strike AIs that keep on playing on offline servers for, like, 20 years?
[29:47.22]Yeah.
[29:47.74]That's what we're gonna be doing right now, except there's, like, nothing but, like, piles and piles of feet sticking up.
[29:54.61]You guys can't hear the game?
[29:55.43]Okay, let me fix that.
[29:58.53]I can't believe this is working.
[30:03.03]I don't think this has been one despawn.
[30:08.35]Is there grenades?
[30:11.17]I think so.
[30:11.61]Can you guys hear this better now?
[30:14.65]I know we're supposed to be playing Halo Reach on Legendary difficulty, but what if we just make the ground that we're walking on made out of bodies?
[30:27.09]And I'm talking, like, most of the ground that you see.
[30:30.22]Like, at least this whole deck.
[30:34.04]We're gonna show you how to, like, go to the secret, uh, places in the game.
[30:37.60]And it's just, like, a pile of fucking, like, limbs.
[30:41.64]Oh.
[30:41.90]How do you throw grenades?
[30:42.84]It's G. Okay, it's G. Oh, fuck.
[30:48.45]All the cores are gonna scatter if we grenade them.
[30:50.57]Wait.
[30:51.81]Oh, no!
[30:52.51]No!
[30:53.87]It respawns the area if we both die.
[30:56.67]OOOH!
[30:57.79]Oh, fuck!
[30:58.59]Alright, we'll start the panning over here.
[31:01.33]Okay, hang on.
[31:01.87]Let me redo the audio here, because everything crapped out.
[31:04.73]Hang on.
[31:04.99]It's not safe here.
[31:08.67]Okay.
[31:09.41]Right here?
[31:10.29]Yeah.
[31:10.63]Just because we're gonna... Don't you want to make the whole deck?
[31:13.75]Alright, let's do it.
[31:18.86]Everyone's saying no.
[31:20.50]What?
[31:24.44]Uh...
[31:26.00]You okay?
[31:26.94]I can't respawn.
[31:28.26]I'm... What's going on?
[31:32.79]I keep spawning in the air over the edge and dying over and over again.
[31:38.65]I can't do anything about this.
[31:40.23]We don't even need to... Which one is me?
[31:45.33]Why is that one falling?
[31:51.45]I'm so blocked.
[31:55.90]You have to jump in.
[31:57.26]You have to jump in.
[31:59.28]Otherwise this area is unsafe.
[32:02.32]No, no, no, you're good.
[32:03.30]Okay, hang on.
[32:07.13]We don't even need to do... Okay, we're good.
[32:08.83]Alright.
[32:11.31]So, Halo is this way, I guess.
[32:14.71]Halo is this way, apparently.
[32:17.90]legendary gamers I thought that was in the game streamers oh god I'm seeing heat six in the structure ahead two streams bad guys on your knees they're not rebels they're farmers kill them
[32:36.61]I didn't do it.
[32:38.07]I didn't do it.
[32:39.59]That was a full clip.
[32:41.45]Hey, hey, you quit that.
[32:43.03]That dodge.
[32:43.81]Wait, why did that kill me?
[32:45.24]And did you... Did you softlock the game?
[32:48.26]Did you softlock the game?
[33:07.16]He's fucking... He's dead.
[33:08.32]Why is this person dead?
[33:14.22]Yeah, hold on.
[33:19.16]I can't... Let me turn up the audio, too.
[33:22.52]I can't barely hear what they're saying.
[33:23.86]Neither can I. The audio is, like, weird in this game.
[33:30.08]Yeah, I've heard, like, there's complaints about the audio being, like, total assholes in this, but...
[33:36.33]You unloaded a whole clip on that guy, and he didn't kill him, and you're telling me that, like, a little bit of a splash from a grenade?
[33:42.49]Was that at the end of his health pool?
[33:44.77]Where are you?
[33:46.31]Okay, I'm right behind you.
[33:53.67]Hang on.
[33:54.33]Oh, the campaign audio is fucked up.
[33:55.85]The audio has a huge encoding issue.
[33:59.25]Oh.
[34:01.05]Did you guys know that this is Jerma's first table game?
[34:04.47]Yeah, this is the first time I've ever held this weapon.
[34:07.55]In fake life.
[34:11.30]Press Q. It's a punch.
[34:15.94]Alright.
[34:16.38]I'm almost dead.
[34:19.71]Wait, oh!
[34:20.15]First enemy!
[34:20.77]Our first enemy!
[34:23.79]I was about to boot you.
[34:32.71]I think this difficulty here is not going to stem from the actual game being difficult.
[34:35.57]It's us having, like, collective brain diarrhea.
[34:38.17]Too much fun.
[34:40.39]AKA too much fun.
[34:42.90]There is too much fun.
[34:45.60]Can never have too much fun.
[34:46.54]Alright, checkpoint.
[34:48.96]Where are the enemies?
[34:50.98]Tell me, I have a question.
[34:52.04]Can you see other bullet decals?
[34:53.48]If I do this?
[34:55.78]Yeah, I can see that.
[34:57.61]Okay.
[34:59.51]You want to draw some shit on the walls?
[35:00.79]Sure.
[35:02.17]Okay, um, unfortunately, fuck, Bullock- Ah, they despawned.
[35:07.59]Okay, quick one.
[35:10.97]Alright, this is win, lose, or draw.
[35:13.13]I'm gonna just think, what is it, what is it?
[35:15.07]Let's see.
[35:17.13]Um, I don't know.
[35:17.83]Circle?
[35:19.63]This is like a drawful.
[35:21.75]Alright, ready?
[35:22.87]Here you go.
[35:24.01]Okay.
[35:25.43]Okay, okay.
[35:26.15]I'm gonna mute and I'm gonna tell my stream what it is.
[35:28.75]Okay.
[35:31.11]It's gonna be Super Mario.
[35:32.25]Okay, so.
[35:45.60]What is that?
[35:46.86]Man with two arms.
[35:47.86]It was Super Mario, close.
[35:52.30]Movement.
[35:52.98]Did you pick the guns up?
[35:59.19]I don't know how, how do you pick them up?
[36:00.91]Enemies!
[36:01.39]Alright, shoot.
[36:01.85]If they were talking.
[36:05.48]I just heard a gun.
[36:08.02]If I start dying, I'm gonna start playing with you.
[36:11.42]They're behind us.
[36:13.04]Oh, okay.
[36:13.67]Are they somebody in the room?
[36:15.89]That's a fucking teammate!
[36:16.75]That's a guy!
[36:17.27]Oh, you just killed that guy.
[36:18.57]They're coming in the house.
[36:20.67]Are they?
[36:21.03]What this?
[36:21.45]Okay, the mini-map is fucking crazy.
[36:26.70]Okay.
[36:28.16]This is not helping the fact that I have like 9,800,000 ping.
[36:30.93]It's a nightmare to play this.
[36:36.09]It is a nightmare.
[36:37.37]I'm dead.
[36:39.21]Oh, fuck.
[36:39.43]I'm dead too.
[36:43.49]Area's not safe.
[36:45.45]Yeah, you have probably 1,000 milliseconds.
[36:51.01]Okay, here's what we'll do.
[36:52.15]I have a proposal, right?
[36:53.45]Because it's going to be impossible for me to shoot, right?
[36:56.29]Here's what we do.
[36:58.07]I'm gonna chase, or rather, you just chase me.
[37:00.31]I just run the fuck forward, alright?
[37:02.14]Run forward?
[37:04.06]Yeah, yeah, okay, no, basically, basically, I'll, I'll... I'll skirmish ahead, and you protect me, alright?
[37:10.06]I think we can do this.
[37:11.20]You go ahead, yeah, go for it.
[37:12.76]I'll protect you.
[37:13.20]Alright, let's go.
[37:13.71]I don't even know where you are, but go for it.
[37:15.71]Just fucking come on!
[37:17.15]Yeah, I'm... Did you... Watch out.
[37:21.83]It's you doing that.
[37:23.03]Hey!
[37:24.43]Get the... Follow me, man.
[37:26.59]You gotta follow me.
[37:27.81]What the fuck?
[37:29.33]Okay, I'm following you.
[37:30.57]I'm following.
[37:31.03]I'm following.
[37:31.59]Okay, we're good.
[37:32.41]Okay.
[37:38.46]Get in the barnyard.
[37:39.18]Is there a crunch?
[37:41.62]Yeah, yeah.
[37:45.98]Okay.
[37:46.96]Nice.
[37:47.64]Watch it.
[37:47.92]Watch it.
[37:50.85]Yo, we got a plasma rifle down here if you want it.
[37:52.91]Is it really?
[37:54.19]Yeah.
[37:55.31]Right here.
[37:56.03]Nice.
[37:56.37]Let me see that.
[37:59.23]Ooh.
[37:59.35]You gotta be careful with that thing.
[38:00.39]Hold E to swap.
[38:04.58]Yep.
[38:05.12]I like this thing a lot.
[38:07.36]Now I... I get it now.
[38:10.26]I get it.
[38:11.32]I've been playing for less than five minutes.
[38:13.80]I get it.
[38:14.14]Oh, dude.
[38:16.02]What's behind you, dude?
[38:18.80]What?
[38:20.41]Where are you?
[38:22.07]Right here.
[38:24.87]Dude, do you get it?
[38:25.91]Do you, like, get it now?
[38:26.83]Like, after playing?
[38:27.45]Like, just the way the weapons feel and the environment.
[38:30.19]I feel it.
[38:31.99]It's coming back to me, man.
[38:33.27]It's like I never left.
[38:34.24]They never left, boys.
[38:35.24]Alright.
[38:36.72]Listen, we got to get some vehicles or something.
[38:38.40]Because as soon as we get in the car or something, that's when the gamer skills unlock.
[38:43.16]Yeah, absolutely.
[38:44.28]I agree.
[38:46.94]Any more down there?
[38:51.02]What the fuck's falling from the sky?
[38:52.00]I don't know.
[38:53.38]It's just like space trash.
[38:56.10]Someone's just dropping trash on us.
[39:00.10]Alright, this is legendary and we're doing just fine.
[39:02.71]We are doing fine.
[39:03.63]We haven't even died once.
[39:05.93]No.
[39:06.57]Not yet.
[39:06.91]Alright, get the space boogers.
[39:13.99]Cross the bridge.
[39:15.47]They're dropping.
[39:18.35]There's a range on this thing.
[39:21.70]I'm listening to out of ammo.
[39:22.84]Oh, fuck.
[39:24.85]Careful of those grenades.
[39:25.73]Is there any guns?
[39:28.83]You see any guns?
[39:32.07]You have fucking infinite ammo, yet you're complaining about, like, guns?
[39:34.77]What?
[39:35.03]You do?
[39:35.33]This infinite ammo?
[39:38.95]I think... You're out of ammo?
[39:41.15]I... Yeah, I didn't have any left.
[39:43.69]Oh.
[39:44.03]Oh, okay.
[39:44.89]Well, you switched out for... You switched out for the fucking, like, cock and ball gun.
[39:48.67]Yeah, this thing sucks.
[39:51.12]Dude, you never use the pistol in any video game.
[39:53.66]It's, like, the worst weapon in every video game.
[39:55.58]No, in Halo 1, the pistol in Halo 1 is great.
[39:58.58]Is it?
[39:59.22]It's the only game that's good, yeah.
[40:03.81]Holy shit, it really is, like, kind of good.
[40:05.79]You're right.
[40:06.17]Well, I don't know about this game, but I know in the previous ones, it's pretty alright.
[40:11.01]Shit, there might be some vehicles around.
[40:12.13]I think I see the remains of, like, a space scooter or something.
[40:15.69]Hang on.
[40:16.43]Dude, in the amount of time it takes to develop the pistol in most video games that are modern video games, you could have, like, just maybe, like, fixed some of the netcode.
[40:26.04]Most of the video games you play, the pistol don't do shit.
[40:32.34]The shotguns in the Halo games are great, because they literally fire half a meter.
[40:38.01]They are disgustingly bad, but they're good, like, because you don't get a lot of range in Halo, but they are completely useless.
[40:47.01]People are talking about how I just have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about.
[40:51.43]So it's a typical Wednesday.
[40:53.86]Okay, I don't know where the fuck I am.
[40:57.96]Oh, there you are.
[40:58.58]Okay.
[40:58.74]Yeah, I was just following you.
[41:00.04]I'm just on slash follow.
[41:05.53]Are there bosses in Halo?
[41:08.71]There might be.
[41:10.41]Oh, get him, get him.
[41:11.59]Get him.
[41:13.52]I heard get him.
[41:14.13]Get those guys.
[41:15.39]Get him.
[41:18.25]Imagine those good orders from the commander.
[41:23.87]Get him.
[41:25.75]Shoot Nate to shoot the barnyard.
[41:27.15]Who, sir?
[41:27.90]I don't know.
[41:28.76]Him.
[41:30.72]Oh, fuck.
[41:31.72]I'm dead.
[41:32.16]You're good, you're good, you're good.
[41:33.50]You can spawn on me.
[41:34.58]Okay, where the fuck are you?
[41:38.34]I'm using this fucking underdeveloped pistol.
[41:43.36]They could've fixed the netcode!
[41:45.86]I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
[41:46.88]I'm gonna die.
[41:50.12]Why the fuck am I, like... Charge it?
[41:53.96]What?
[41:55.86]Hey!
[41:59.11]I'm not fucking going out there!
[42:01.69]No, I don't wanna go out there.
[42:04.73]Everybody, die!
[42:06.57]This is just the... Alright, you played WoW Battlegrounds when it was like 40 versus 40?
[42:12.01]Did you play Warcraft back in the day?
[42:13.45]I'm a big World of Warcraft player, actually.
[42:15.87]I have a big, big history with that game.
[42:19.90]Sometimes you'll aim and just hit a random person, and then everyone else is doing a bunch of work for you.
[42:24.82]This is just Altered Valley, yeah.
[42:27.06]I think I did something.
[42:29.44]I put a dot on a guy.
[42:34.18]Okay, well, listen, I'm gonna get the space turkeys.
[42:37.05]Oh my god, I just took so many hits.
[42:39.15]I have no ammo.
[42:41.41]You know what, this game needs big sniper rifles so you can like take pot shots from like two countries away.
[42:46.49]Because you don't want to be in this oatmeal of like fire and lasers.
[42:49.97]No, you don't.
[42:50.73]I need a weapon.
[42:51.99]Ow.
[42:52.63]I'm dead.
[42:54.23]Can I just like give you my weapon?
[42:55.81]This is ridiculous.
[42:56.65]Oh shit, we both dead.
[42:59.56]No, I'm still here.
[43:00.40]I'm still here.
[43:00.94]Okay, there we go.
[43:01.38]This is what I'm talking about.
[43:07.28]Playing this feels like I'm drunk.
[43:09.12]It feels like...
[43:10.79]I woke up in this game and they sprayed my pillow with PCP and said, here, have a gun, shoot.
[43:16.67]This feels disgusting to play.
[43:18.27]I can't tell you why this is so off.
[43:21.27]You might be like, you're playing like shit, Joel, but... I feel like these guys are so hard.
[43:27.65]Why are these guys so hard?
[43:30.65]Are these enemies throwing grenades in here?
[43:35.42]Okay, listen.
[43:36.41]Here's my strategy.
[43:37.77]Okay, check this out, check this out.
[43:41.25]They're standing over there.
[43:42.53]Let's not deal with that.
[43:43.71]Let's just do this instead.
[43:45.15]Fuck it.
[43:48.83]Whatever the fuck's going on over there, we just... I hesitated for a second.
[43:55.90]Okay, don't we have to go over here, though, for the objective?
[44:00.34]I found a fucking vehicle!
[44:01.16]Hang on, hang on!
[44:01.76]Wait, you found a car?
[44:02.28]I think so.
[44:04.26]I think that's it.
[44:04.78]Oh, please get us in that car.
[44:07.52]Oh, no.
[44:07.76]It's not a car.
[44:08.80]It's a remains of something.
[44:10.02]Oh, hang on.
[44:12.15]I found you a gun.
[44:12.61]I found you a gun.
[44:13.15]I found you one of these.
[44:14.69]Whatever it is.
[44:19.33]Is this thing good?
[44:21.45]Alright.
[44:24.57]Let's go.
[44:24.89]Let's go help our friend.
[44:30.53]This is like an auto stapler.
[44:32.25]This is a staple.
[44:33.81]There's a stapler.
[44:34.57]Is the stapler any good?
[44:37.85]I don't remember, but maybe.
[44:43.69]Are you winning?
[44:44.11]Are you winning?
[44:45.33]I don't know.
[44:46.21]I don't think so.
[44:49.26]It seems like you're doing it.
[44:50.50]I'm hiding behind a tree.
[44:51.32]Okay, listen.
[44:56.60]Oh my god, these guys are all like, these guys are all bosses.
[45:04.02]I don't know if you see the same shit on my screen, but... Oh, that guy's dead?
[45:07.34]Get over here.
[45:08.10]Okay, I'm coming.
[45:09.64]Is the Corpus on local or is it multiplayer?
[45:12.00]Because I see this one dude and it's like... Do you see this?
[45:16.74]Yeah, this guy?
[45:21.92]Just make sure he's dead.
[45:25.80]What's the heal button?
[45:27.84]You think there's a heal button?
[45:29.25]It's old Halo, hard.
[45:31.95]Right?
[45:32.41]Right?
[45:32.97]That's what everyone's gonna say?
[45:33.69]Okay, Boomer.
[45:34.63]Okay, Boomer.
[45:43.50]Alright, this guy's gonna kill me.
[45:45.06]T?
[45:46.50]T doesn't do anything?
[45:50.75]They took all my shields off.
[45:54.54]This game, like, again, I don't want to criticize this game, but it feels like we've taken on a task.
[46:01.24]It feels like everybody's, like, it's the equivalent of, like, being in a room full of, like, neurosurgeons, and you don't know what the fuck's going on, and you're standing there with a suit on saying, yes, I agree.
[46:13.63]Like, there's so much shit happening, and I can't contribute.
[46:16.91]Do headshots matter?
[46:17.81]Yeah.
[46:18.63]We're in a room full of surgeons.
[46:19.83]It's true.
[46:20.93]And they just all handed us scalpels and they're like, alright, this guy needs a new brain.
[46:25.11]Go for it.
[46:25.47]Like, oh, what does this scalpel do?
[46:32.16]Do headshots do anything?
[46:33.00]That should be it.
[46:34.40]Confirm.
[46:35.00]Don't give me that.
[46:35.58]Oh, we did it.
[46:36.32]We did it.
[46:37.00]We did it.
[46:38.22]Commander, I'm seeing more hostile activity.
[46:40.04]Look at the space turkey.
[46:41.72]You guys didn't think we were going to do it.
[46:42.86]Camille, you're with Kat.
[46:44.24]Six and I will run interference on the ground.
[46:46.14]We'll meet you at the
[46:47.83]Look at this disgusting fucking creature.
[46:51.13]Look at these things.
[46:51.87]It's a waste of imagination.
[46:54.06]Look at him.
[46:55.48]Is that a mouth?
[46:58.04]Oh, that's his mouth.
[46:59.48]You think there's a god after looking at that thing?
[47:01.88]Look at him.
[47:03.15]This is just a Power Rangers villain.
[47:04.79]You're looking at his ass.
[47:11.27]We're looking at the wrong way.
[47:14.42]How do you heal?
[47:16.56]Oh, I found cars!
[47:18.10]How do you heal?
[47:20.88]Can you heal me?
[47:22.88]Just get in the car.
[47:24.14]Wait, we're gonna get in our own cars?
[47:26.28]No, no, no.
[47:27.47]Okay, fine.
[47:28.27]You wanna fucking drive?
[47:29.01]Wait.
[47:29.11]Hang on.
[47:32.03]Ready to rock and roll.
[47:33.21]Wait, they all get in this car?
[47:35.55]No, no, no.
[47:36.21]I'm coming in.
[47:37.09]Now I'm riding in a shotgun.
[47:38.47]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:41.01]What the fuck are you doing?
[47:44.38]Um, flip it.
[47:46.61]No.
[47:46.83]Wait, what the fuck?
[47:50.21]I was gonna- I was gonna put a grenade underneath the carcass.
[47:53.63]I forgot to, like, manually flip them, and I accidentally, like, murder-fucked you.
[47:57.41]I'm sorry.
[47:57.85]Okay, well, I hit a rock.
[47:59.60]Whatever.
[47:59.90]We have to wait for our friends to get in.
[48:01.26]It's bumbling, fuck.
[48:05.10]Let's go.
[48:07.48]Alright, so now where do we have to go?
[48:09.40]Don't crash.
[48:13.27]Careful.
[48:13.87]Rebels don't leave plasma burns.
[48:16.39]Why am I getting like a breaking news bolt?
[48:18.49]What was that?
[48:18.97]Vehicles control like shit in Halo, so watch out.
[48:22.69]Yes.
[48:23.87]I can't even turn the car left.
[48:26.32]No, use the mouse, dude.
[48:27.74]You drive with a mouse?
[48:29.54]What the fuck?
[48:30.42]Yes.
[48:33.42]You're running on a turkey.
[48:34.36]Fuck him, fuck him.
[48:34.92]Hang on.
[48:37.88]An alligator by you.
[48:39.40]Well...
[48:41.70]There are enemies here.
[48:42.87]There are actual enemies here, and we get both the turkeys.
[48:46.29]Alright, I'm going to get a good spot.
[48:48.99]Okay.
[48:49.23]Where are they?
[48:51.63]Where are they?
[48:52.79]Up there.
[48:56.07]Alright, get them.
[48:59.59]Nice.
[49:00.09]Excellent work.
[49:00.63]That's right.
[49:04.27]There we go.
[49:05.93]That was pretty good.
[49:07.04]It's as if you don't even... It's just that you don't have 10,000 ping.
[49:13.90]Hey, I try my best.
[49:14.98]I probably shouldn't have gone this way.
[49:17.92]We have a blue guy after us.
[49:19.90]I don't know if we're supposed to pick him up or... Is it a blue guy?
[49:22.74]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:24.44]They're like, swerve a little bit more.
[49:27.02]That guy, that guy right there.
[49:28.00]Is he going in the car or... Hey, honk.
[49:32.30]Not like this.
[49:32.84]Not like this.
[49:36.29]I don't think... I think he just stands around.
[49:38.25]Alright, let me get on the road.
[49:43.75]Can you do me a favor?
[49:44.23]Can you just, like, smash into a Mach 5?
[49:46.03]Oh!
[49:49.31]Oh, hang on!
[49:53.38]This actually is kind of hard to control.
[49:55.48]Because in my brain, it's A and D. What's that?

[52:08.91]Okay, but it's not GTA logic.
[52:11.39]Is it GTA logic?
[52:12.33]No, no, it's not GTA logic.
[52:14.47]It's not going to explode.
[52:15.57]Okay, I hope so.
[52:16.33]It'll be fine.
[52:17.16]It'll be fine.
[52:17.62]Get in the car.
[52:18.52]But don't we have to kill these mutants?
[52:21.64]Yeah, but you're safer with me, ironically.
[52:26.76]Ironically.

[56:07.84]Alright.
[56:08.14]There we go.
[56:11.14]Alright.
[56:11.74]You drive.
[56:12.58]I ride shotgun this time.
[56:13.68]Okay.
[56:13.92]And if we can't have it, nobody can.
[56:18.81]Shit.
[56:18.93]I'm out of ammo.
[56:19.47]I don't think you can even destroy it.
[56:23.49]You want to ram it and see if you can?
[56:27.80]We got a brand new set of wheels.
[56:29.08]Alright, grab the ordnance.
[56:31.16]Okay.
[56:37.68]I don't know why, but this feels like... This doesn't feel like a space shooter.
[56:45.21]It feels like some redneck molasses game.
[56:49.75]Alright, we gotta hide back here.
[56:50.95]Okay, but I'm fucking dead.
[56:54.36]Okay, well, I'm gonna not die.
[56:56.37]Here we go.
[56:57.05]We just defend this point.
[56:58.21]Grab the ordnance.
[56:58.99]Where's the... There's an ordnance somewhere.
[57:03.11]What's an ordnance?
[57:04.63]What is an ordnance?
[57:08.12]Hey gamers, welcome back to another Let's Play of ToeJam & Earl.
[57:19.18]I don't want to give this game shit once again, but this feels so disorienting, and I don't know if it's because of the lag.
[57:23.98]Oh, it's definitely because of your input lag.
[57:27.56]You might as well have one eye closed, and, like, three spoonfuls of peanut butter in your mouth.
[57:34.60]That's what it feels like.
[57:37.52]Oh, and both your socks are soaking fucking wet.
[57:41.80]And your shoes.
[57:42.30]You're in shoes and socks, and it's like you stood in a puddle and you just kept them on.
[57:46.16]Fucking god, I'm dead.
[57:51.14]You know, I'm going to get a little real with you.
[57:55.44]I don't think playing on Legendary is a great idea for this.
[57:57.67]No, no, it wasn't.
[57:59.29]But we have to.
[58:00.21]If you don't play... Look, you know how many people are streaming this game right now and they're playing on Legendary?
[58:04.05]We have to keep up with the streamers.
[58:06.05]Alright.
[58:08.15]They're going to leave us in the dust if we don't.
[58:11.31]That's what we're going to do.
[58:14.16]I got a little tip for you.
[58:17.52]Get the fuck out of here.
[58:19.36]Just leave.
[58:19.96]We're going to get battlefielded.
[58:21.10]It's going to say you're moving too far away.
[58:22.64]No, no, no, no, no.
[58:26.14]I see checkpoint done.
[58:28.23]What?
[58:29.61]It said checkpoint done, so I'm doing something right.
[58:32.25]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[58:39.17]Are we not softlocked?
[58:40.25]Can we get unsoftlocked?
[58:42.41]I don't know.
[58:43.87]We've already been here.
[58:47.04]Can't the AI, like, just play with himself for a little bit and, you know... People are saying, like, turn on V-Sync and it'll be done.
[58:53.73]Or, like, it'll be better, but... Have we reset the checkpoint?
[59:01.53]We're seeing set pieces we're not supposed to see yet.
[59:05.02]The cameras aren't here yet.
[59:06.22]I'm gonna ask you something.
[59:10.93]Go for it.
[59:11.87]Vsync?
[59:13.42]What the fuck is Vsync?
[59:14.44]It's called vertical sync.
[59:16.08]It syncs every frame as it is rendered.
[59:19.74]Because after years of streaming, Vsync for me has just become synonymous with turn the shit off because it doesn't work.
[59:24.35]Yeah, it locks your frame rate down to your monitor's refresh rate.
[59:28.47]Which can help in some scenarios.
[59:30.39]It gets rid of screen tearing, but it will not let you go to the maximum where your graphics card is capable.
[59:35.82]So let's say if you have V-sync turned on and you have a 60hz 60 refresh rate monitor, it'll look a little chunky and we're dead.
[59:43.88]In fact, I think I came into two pieces.
[59:45.86]Alright, so we're gonna put it to heroic difficulty.
[59:51.15]I gotta turn that shit down.
[59:52.15]Alright, how do we turn it on?
[59:53.92]I think you have to do it.
[59:55.02]Do I have to do it?
[59:55.68]You're the host.
[59:56.44]Okay, hold on.
[59:57.30]Where is settings?
[60:00.08]Okay, difficulty.
[60:03.12]Gameplay.
[60:07.70]I think we have to go... We have to exit the game.
[60:10.11]Alright, we're gonna try it for real one more time.
[60:13.61]One more try?
[60:14.23]Alright.
[60:14.61]I'm down to clown.
[60:15.59]Try it for real?
[60:17.29]But you promise me... You will do your absolute best this time, alright?
[60:22.31]like concentrate all your our gamer juices into one one one shot here alright yeah I can't I can't change it here alright let's try it let's do this I really like like just a little quick side note I really wish we could just do like team slayer or something like that or captain the flag because this feels so oh good lord
[60:50.31]We have to get to the first boss.
[60:52.43]Oh, hey, look at this checkpoint!
[60:53.83]Oh, nice.
[60:55.23]Alright, this is perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.
[60:56.71]Now we can... Okay.
[60:58.99]Now they don't even know we're here.
[61:03.39]My teammates are screaming, but I don't give a fuck.
[61:07.28]This is perfect, actually.
[61:08.26]Holy shit, this worked.
[61:10.06]Hey.
[61:15.04]Okay, you just be careful here.
[61:18.03]Remember, you gotta press U to get the health up real quick.
[61:23.31]Is that really doing anything?
[61:24.55]U?
[61:25.39]Yeah.
[61:26.27]What?
[61:26.55]I thought it was people saying T. No, it's U. Was I lied to?
[61:29.61]No.
[61:34.09]U. Legendary is hard, especially if you are too... Alright.
[61:42.69]Alright, whatever.
[61:43.71]Whatever you say.
[61:48.25]I feel like this thing has a scope on it.
[61:53.99]How you doing?
[61:54.65]You doing good?
[61:56.11]Yeah, I'm doing excellent.
[61:57.97]It's coming back to me, man.
[62:03.06]Also, make sure this is a pro tip that I heard from the chat, because I apparently was doing poorly.
[62:07.54]If you don't hold the button down, it's more accurate.
[62:15.30]Jeremiah, don't take this the wrong way, but...
[62:18.81]Do you play video games?
[62:33.18]Yes, I do.
[62:35.52]Did you do that?
[62:36.10]Have you ever been in a video game before?
[62:41.27]Yeah.
[62:41.59]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[62:42.61]Wait a minute here.
[62:43.41]Hold on.
[62:45.32]Have you?
[62:47.72]Have you beaten Sekiro?
[62:54.51]Listen, I don't know if you know this, but I happen to know someone.
[62:59.53]His name is Jeff Keighley, and he's hosting the Video Game Olympics.
[63:02.83]Do you know?
[63:03.31]Do you actually know him?
[63:04.95]When I go on the Video Game Olympics stage, and someone gets a little, you know, snort, snort, wink at the camera, I know it's from me.
[63:19.20]So that was a very long-winded way to say no.
[63:23.29]I've never beaten Sekiro.
[63:25.97]Oh, well.
[63:27.47]I think I've got a couple more gamer Boy Scout badges.
[63:35.06]Where are you?
[63:35.64]Yeah.
[63:41.82]I'll tell you what.
[63:42.32]Here's what we're going to do.
[63:43.50]We're going to settle this with some... Actually, there might be shit behind us that's... Okay, I was going to do a cowboy duel.
[63:51.28]Whatever strongest weapon we have, we shoot each other in the head.
[63:52.99]And whoever loses, loses the argument.
[63:55.85]Okay.
[63:57.41]Wait, you mean... No, you mean like here in the game.
[64:00.41]Yes, in the game.
[64:04.86]Yeah, I just fucking murder you.
[64:06.04]Alright.
[64:10.33]That's the easiest.
[64:13.99]Fuckin' easy.
[64:14.87]Oh yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
[64:19.96]I go first though.
[64:20.92]Oh, okay, fine, that's fair.
[64:27.80]Why are we like green?
[64:29.45]I don't know.
[64:32.73]What happened to that bridge?
[64:35.71]Oh, no, no, okay, you activate Night Vision with 4?
[64:38.65]If you press 4... Oh!
[64:40.83]It's not Night Vision, it's like... Goom mode?
[64:44.29]Yeah, this is not Night Vision, this is just highlight everybody with neon markers.
[64:50.95]People are saying in chat, welcome to Fallout 3.
[64:54.58]Fallout 3?
[64:54.90]Did you play Fallout 3?
[65:00.20]Um... I did.
[65:02.56]Not very long, though.
[65:03.32]I played New Vegas.
[65:06.18]You know something called VATS?
[65:08.54]Yeah.
[65:09.74]I've got visual.
[65:11.42]What about it?
[65:12.02]The one where you freeze and it goes .
[65:16.52]I can't fucking end the call right now, because after hearing that, I'm going to have a coronary.
[65:21.48]Alright, we have to play.
[65:26.56]We have to play.
[65:27.22]Get ready to play.
[65:27.94]Alright.
[65:35.99]And then we turn the difficulty down, and then we switch, so you don't have to deal with the insane, horrible problem.
[65:45.35]Oh, dude, watch out!
[65:45.91]It's him!
[65:47.07]What?
[65:48.19]It's him!
[65:48.91]Who's him?
[65:49.31]Who?
[65:50.56]Who?
[65:50.72]That guy!
[65:51.84]Me?
[65:52.04]Behind you, dude!
[65:52.80]No!
[65:53.12]No, behind you, dude!
[65:54.02]Dude, no, no, no, no!
[65:55.00]No!
[65:55.62]The forward!
[65:56.10]No, no!
[65:57.94]What happened?
[66:00.56]Who?
[66:00.94]Him?
[66:01.68]Who's him?
[66:02.38]Who?
[66:03.42]Who are you referring to?
[66:05.50]Who?
[66:05.94]The collective who, like, them, you know, like, multiples.
[66:09.88]Watch out for that grenade.
[66:11.97]What the fuck?
[66:13.13]No, why?
[66:13.93]I, I warned you about it.
[66:16.15]What happened?
[66:16.67]What happened?
[66:18.89]I, I did, let's just say I did a very good job.
[66:22.19]Okay.
[66:25.38]You're not Jeremiah.
[66:26.74]I gotta drop the facetious bullshit here for a second, but I think this might be the worst fucking gameplay of Halo Reach out on Twitch right now in the world.
[66:38.32]No way.
[66:40.40]No, I can't.
[66:41.12]No way.
[66:41.60]No way.
[66:42.10]We're in legendary difficulty.
[66:43.20]There's people that are playing this uneasy right now.
[66:45.21]Come on.
[66:48.65]Yeah, but we're playing like limbless toddlers.
[66:55.73]And we're doing a great job.
[67:02.66]I think we're doing just fine.
[67:05.58]Oh dude, watch out!
[67:06.08]They're gonna get you again, man!
[67:10.21]Fuck, you looking at me?
[67:11.63]That wasn't me!
[67:12.91]Oh, there's a sniper rifle here!
[67:15.95]No, no, no!
[67:16.25]Serious!
[67:17.55]I'm fucking serious!
[67:19.73]You betrayed my tender dragoon!
[67:21.94]I'll take that sniper rifle.
[67:25.41]Where is it?
[67:27.48]Okay, hang on, hang on.
[67:28.32]Wait.
[67:29.80]Put on the night vision.
[67:31.46]Okay, hold on.
[67:33.10]Is that it?
[67:35.64]You didn't take it already?
[67:37.04]No, where is it?
[67:37.56]Hold still, hold still.
[67:39.51]Are you holding it?
[67:41.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[67:42.59]No, if I was holding it, that would be embarrassing.
[67:44.93]Am I blind?
[67:47.87]No, I can't pick it up.
[67:49.00]Is that it on the ground right here?
[67:50.81]No, no, no, no, there was one that was like a burst rifle.
[67:53.41]Am I, am I holding it?
[67:54.47]No, no, no, no, god damn it, no.
[67:57.82]Guys, you saw the fucking battle right, it's on the wall?
[67:59.74]What do you mean on the wall?
[68:02.92]Oh, no, there, okay, there it is, there it is.
[68:04.48]Oh, fuck.
[68:05.54]I thought it was like on the ground, alright.
[68:07.86]Me too.
[68:11.66]Listen, I think it's really awful of you guys to talk down to an extremist that has porcelain eyes like us.
[68:21.68]And I want to make a public awareness PSA about, you know, there are gamers with two porcelain eyes, and we exist, and you should stop being so condescending all the time.
[68:36.81]Can you hear how many key presses I'm pressing?
[68:39.87]That means I'm doing great.
[68:45.92]Porcelain eyes?
[68:51.42]Are you sniping?
[68:53.02]No, no, no, no, no.
[68:53.60]There's a guy over there.
[68:54.86]Hang on.
[68:57.51]Did you get the sniper rifle?
[68:58.43]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[68:59.11]Are we supposed to be doing something in particular here?
[69:00.71]Yeah, we need to fall back into autopilot.
[69:03.05]Alright, we need to keep Kat and Ernie alive.
[69:07.49]Well, Emily.
[69:09.85]Ernie?
[69:12.41]Headshot this guy.
[69:13.27]Nice.
[69:14.49]Okay, somebody says we need to get the forklift.
[69:18.67]We can drive the forklift?
[69:21.42]Wait, you can drop a forklift?
[69:22.96]Apparently, chat's saying that.
[69:25.35]That's pretty sick, really?
[69:26.35]I don't know.
[69:30.07]I'm gonna rip... I like the sniper rifle.
[69:31.49]I'm a real precise, precision gamer.
[69:39.90]No, I'm just dead.
[69:40.44]Alright, we're closing in.
[69:41.32]Good.
[69:41.48]You can't... Okay, good.
[69:44.18]Alright, I dare you to stand right in the middle and get crushed by the elevator doors.
[69:47.81]You wanna do it at the same time?
[69:50.72]Is that gonna happen?
[69:52.58]You wanna fuckin' get strawberry jammed?
[69:55.38]Alright, let's go, let's go.
[69:56.28]Oh, no, it did the thing!
[69:58.72]It did the thing where the elevator just opens back up!
[70:05.19]Like, you know when you go to the elevator and somebody's like, oh shit, hold it for you, and they make the sensor open?
[70:12.27]Alright, well... Give me a rifle.
[70:15.90]Are you talking to me?

[70:52.51]Yeah.
[70:52.61]Are you seriously?
[70:53.41]When are you talking to me?
[71:06.95]You need to realize something.
[71:08.25]I don't have an off switch.
[71:09.35]Off switch?
[71:09.67]Off switch?
[71:09.95]So which one of these is Halo?
[71:37.21]I think I died.
[71:40.26]Alright, here we go.

[71:58.58]Yeah, there's the forklift.
[71:59.66]Alright.
[72:19.91]Guys, I have a really dumb question, but... I can't drive it.
[72:23.23]Oh my god.
[72:23.55]Can you get in?
[72:24.05]I don't think I can get in.
[72:26.19]I think it's only you.
[72:27.37]You're just in the street sweeper.
[72:29.94]Can you lift me?
[72:31.66]Can you move me?
[72:34.64]Can you get out of here?
[72:36.80]Yep.
[72:37.60]I guess.
[72:39.44]Nope.
[72:42.58]Can you actually activate the prongs?
[72:46.10]Can I?
[72:46.38]What the fuck happened?
[72:49.71]I'm upside down.
[72:50.45]Alright, there you are.
[72:55.93]Good.
[72:56.69]Alright, go fork somebody.
[72:59.54]I'll try, hang on.
[73:01.08]Oh, they're behind us.
[73:02.78]In the complete opposite direction.
[73:07.90]Oh fuck, I'm stuck on some boxes.
[73:12.40]Hey, welcome back to Shenmue, everybody.
[73:17.21]Can this music start?
[73:20.06]I feel like this music is about to start, but it won't.
[73:26.28]What the fuck was that?
[73:30.69]I'm having serious problems with this fucking forklift.
[73:34.23]Why do you like to drive this thing?
[73:35.71]It's awful.
[73:36.49]You're just a forklift guy now, so...
[73:42.24]It's the Home Depot theme.
[73:44.56]You know what I love about this forklift piece of shit?
[73:47.46]What?
[73:48.42]Sometime in the space future, they decided that normal boxy forklifts
[73:53.04]didn't cut it anymore.
[73:53.90]They had to like overcomplicate the design to make it look like a giant fucking VR headset.
[74:00.38]All you really need is the fork part, right?
[74:02.86]And the engine.
[74:03.36]Yeah.
[74:04.44]Why does it look like that?
[74:05.44]What's all this other stuff here?
[74:07.06]This is a... What's the thing that cleans the ice?
[74:11.70]The Zamboni?
[74:12.72]Yeah.
[74:16.06]I'm trying to get on the forklift here, but... Again, I'm just... Oh, fuck.
[74:22.12]Not like that.
[74:24.65]What is this copypasta right now?
[74:26.07]What is going on?
[74:26.69]There's like a horrendous copypasta going on.
[74:30.39]Yeah, mine's going on.
[74:34.43]I have no idea what's going on here.
[74:36.17]I don't know what started that.
[74:38.97]I... But it's taken over everything.
[74:43.12]Something about going to the... I don't know.
[74:46.24]Taco Bell and wiping your ass?
[74:48.26]I don't know.
[74:48.62]I have no idea.
[74:51.64]Oh god.
[74:53.18]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[74:59.61]What's the funniest injury you've ever sustained in real life?
[75:02.97]Funniest injury I've ever sustained in my real life?
[75:05.53]Yeah.
[75:07.57]Probably when I was, I don't know, probably like 12 years old.
[75:13.31]And me and my brother were playing karate fighters on our bed, on a big pull-out mattress.
[75:22.57]Yeah, karate fighters.
[75:24.61]Yeah, we were really into like ninjas and like karate and it was Ninja Turtles and Power Rangers it was like big and everything so he ended up we were just doing like fake kind of like you know like the punches and kicks and stuff and He's just like in 1949 or something.
[75:43.32]Yeah, I
[75:46.15]So he accidentally during our just very, it was not, we were not trying to hurt each other.
[75:51.31]It was just, he went, he went too far forward on the bed and I got like actually slightly kicked into like the chest area, uh, which made me fall flying back off of the, uh, pull out mattress.
[76:05.87]And I hit the back of my head on the fireplace.
[76:10.13]And I had to get, like, six staples in the back of my head.
[76:13.39]Jesus.
[76:18.24]What about you?
[76:20.76]Well, I have a couple of funny injuries, actually.
[76:23.36]I learned a lot about, like, the body.
[76:29.28]Well, weird twist here.
[76:30.04]But anyway, I learned a lot about, like, how your blood works and shit like that.
[76:35.22]I must have been, like, 10 or 9 or whatever.
[76:36.64]And me and my friend...
[76:39.17]we were biking.
[76:40.07]And coincidentally, super hot that day, had our shorts on.
[76:45.66]I was thrown off the bike on a street bump or whatever it was, right?
[76:51.82]And I immediately thought that what's the best way of sustaining a fall?
[76:58.25]Oh, I used your knees.
[76:58.77]Mm-hmm.
[77:00.96]And you know those, like, the who of rock slides they do on stage where they just kind of go with their knees, like, scraping on pure asphalt?
[77:10.44]I did, like, a whole meter.
[77:13.05]Where were your shin pads?
[77:14.95]Where were your shin pads?
[77:18.19]So what happened was, here's the morbid part.
[77:23.13]My friend just took off because he didn't want to deal with it.
[77:26.88]What?
[77:29.40]Well...
[77:30.73]What do you mean he took off?
[77:32.53]Yeah, he took off.
[77:33.11]He didn't want to deal with it.
[77:33.93]So I walked home to my mom.
[77:35.83]What?
[77:36.01]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[77:37.73]No, no, no.
[77:38.11]I was hardcore, man.
[77:39.13]Here's the thing.
[77:39.87]I was so shocked.
[77:41.49]I was so shocked on what had happened that I came home and I didn't realize the full grasp of what had happened.
[77:49.74]Extended your injury.
[77:51.48]Yeah, exactly.
[77:52.04]So I came home and I expected my mother to be sympathetic.
[77:55.06]Like, oh my God, what have you done, Joel?
[77:56.71]But she kept screaming at me.
[77:59.27]God.
[78:00.94]And I remember it was really bad, but the worst part, this is setting up a funny story here.
[78:08.89]I'm like puking my asshole off.
[78:10.49]But anyway, the point being is that I learned that you have like yellow goo in your knees.
[78:17.41]Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no.
[78:20.53]These things are called fat balls.
[78:22.18]Oh, man.
[78:26.48]Yellow guck came out of my knees.
[78:34.88]Everything was fine, really.
[78:35.84]It's just one of those things where your joints kind of bend.
[78:41.66]I'll make this torture stop.
[78:44.54]The funny part is this, basically.
[78:46.10]I was a big boy.
[78:47.52]They put me down on surgery, or they just stitched me up, really.
[78:51.41]But they kept popping popsicles in my mouth to shut me up.
[78:55.87]That's when I can never eat popsicles again.
[78:59.64]Holy shit.
[79:01.06]I've never heard... And you know what?
[79:03.14]Here's the worst part of what you just said.
[79:04.38]I, like... Somehow, I don't know why, but I know what you're talking about.
[79:11.20]I don't even... I shouldn't, but I... Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[79:14.73]Like, we have, like, platelets and shit and, like, proteins and fat and stuff.
[79:19.23]So, I... Oh, God.
[79:26.07]You want to know an even funnier story?
[79:30.25]I won't sustain brain injuries from playing Halo online.
[79:36.04]Is this like a new injury?
[79:39.45]Is this a new injury from recently?
[79:42.73]I just saw you run it.
[79:46.91]It happened three seconds ago.
[79:53.51]know when you're playing a game and you're like there's no consequence or like anything anymore you're just like get me through the area you're just like on autopilot running forward that's so funny oh god just make it stop there was some we were talking before before uh on stream you said there was some story that I should have saved for um
[80:17.54]the stream right what was that what was that there was there was there was a thing to talk about some some some oh yeah okay okay so we've been trying to set up some to stream for weeks on end right we're gonna do pogo stuff and all that stuff okay and here's the thing here's how I work Jerma uh I need to like not walk around and gain something like story because I I can't multitask alright sorry I'll be the gamer
[80:42.17]okay okay well check this out so I I thought I thought that Jerma was seriously super into halo I don't know where this fucking came from but I thought because we were trying to set this up jerome messages me and say you want to play halo and I say sure
[80:59.16]Because I know you as the Tea Forkers 2 guy, I thought, you must have been, like, drowning in pussy back in the Halo days.
[81:06.06]Like, you must have been suffocating in the amount of, like, puss.
[81:09.28]And I was afraid of actually playing with you.
[81:10.94]I thought, this is someone who's been playing, like, Halo since it came out day one.
[81:17.21]So I actually got anxious even hitting you up about it.
[81:20.41]I was thinking...
[81:22.11]I'm gonna get slaughtered online.
[81:23.51]It's gonna be humiliating.
[81:25.57]And... I was just so intimidated by it.
[81:28.47]And then... Today... I call you up.
[81:32.91]And today I call you up and you say... I've never played Halo in my entire fucking life.
[81:39.29]Yeah.
[81:39.99]What you're seeing right now is the first time I've ever actually sat down and truly tried to play it.
[81:47.06]And I gotta say...
[81:49.57]Pretty fun.
[81:51.33]Pretty fun game.
[81:53.76]It's kind of like going to the dentist.
[82:01.18]I was going to make some sort of smart analogy, but I'm like, nah, fuck it, I dropped that.
[82:05.12]I mean, I love dentists.
[82:06.49]You're speaking my language.
[82:09.43]That's a grenade.
[82:09.93]I tried to pick it up off the ground.
[82:11.15]Are you fucking kidding me?
[82:12.07]What an idiot.
[82:20.82]Alright, after this, these guys are gonna be done.
[82:29.18]You know when I said that we should probably play something else together?
[82:31.82]Just be like, play some Bomberman or Super Nintendo or something like that.
[82:35.26]I started off making that joke, but now I actually, like, I'm thinking about it.
[82:38.02]I'm like, dude, I probably have more fun.
[82:39.79]Fucking fun bomber, man.
[82:41.93]I mean, this game isn't bad, but it's like, it's, it's, it's like, I'm sedated.
[82:48.25]I mean, I'm going in for surgery or something.
[82:50.15]Like, I'm at the dentist.
[82:51.49]They're putting the fucking laugh mask on me.
[82:53.14]Like, you know.
[82:54.52]Hey, you want to go clean a room and visit our cleanup detail?
[82:57.70]Yeah, sure.
[82:58.12]I got the sword now.
[83:11.06]Wait, we did it.
[83:11.80]How long?
[83:13.62]That's us.
[83:16.34]Is that actually the two of us?
[83:18.34]I don't know.
[83:19.16]I don't think so.
[83:20.96]That's how Jerma gets you.
[83:21.90]Yeah, he brings up... He brings up, uh... Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[83:24.66]Yeah, all streams end in Viscera... That's true.
[83:26.38]Find out what she knows.
[83:40.05]You ever stuck your arm in a drain pipe?
[83:44.67]Wait, what?
[83:46.28]You ever stuck your arm in a drain pipe?
[83:48.14]How does your arm fit in a drain pipe?
[83:50.58]Like, what kind of drain?
[83:52.82]Have you ever, like, gotten so much hair in the shower drain or anything like that, and you had to, like, buckle up and become a big boy?
[84:02.25]And reach down into your shower drain?
[84:05.39]Yeah.
[84:06.23]And just get in there?
[84:08.09]Yeah.
[84:08.65]You know they make snakes for that, right?
[84:10.49]Where you, like, snake it down and pull up... You don't have to use your hand.
[84:14.81]Snakes?
[84:15.49]Yeah, they're like drain snakes.
[84:18.21]You slide down into the drain, you move around, you pull it up.
[84:21.57]Are you talking about contraceptive?
[84:24.19]No, it's a snake!
[84:26.63]It's a snake that... It's a drain snake!
[84:30.19]The body stays here.
[84:31.64]Thank you, sir.
[84:32.59]Like a hand condom, for like... No!
[84:35.78]Alright, let me up, okay.
[84:36.76]There's a device, that's, you just, you pulled my leg here.
[84:40.66]There's a device, I'm still gonna say it.
[84:42.32]It's a device that's made out of plastic.
[84:43.78]Wait, wait, wait, are you saying D-R-A-A and snake?
[84:47.60]Or are you saying trained snake?
[84:49.46]What are you saying?
[84:49.92]I don't understand your English.
[84:51.06]Drain?
[84:52.70]D-R-A-E-N.
[84:54.36]Okay, I thought you were saying trained snake.
[84:57.22]Drain, like... There are no rebels.
[85:00.22]And then I'm like, he can't be saying that.
[85:02.60]He must be saying something else.
[85:03.82]He's just saying sort of like... Armor?
[85:06.22]For his fucking arm?
[85:08.64]Like... Drains?
[85:10.13]Oh, no.
[85:11.97]You said that you reach... Alright, you opened the conversation.
[85:14.63]You said, hey, you ever reach down your fucking drain?
[85:17.43]And I'm like, no, he's a drain snake.
[85:19.25]And then you're like, what are you talking about?
[85:20.77]And I'm like, drain snake.
[85:21.45]And now here we are.
[85:22.11]I thought you were saying train snakes.
[85:24.61]Train snakes?
[85:26.27]Train snakes.
[85:28.58]Okay, listen, this game is not good for us.
[85:29.98]We're fucking dropping, like, the last few brain cells we have.
[85:33.02]Oh, I lost those about two or three years ago.
[85:34.55]There you go.
[85:38.53]I want you to recite what the fuck happened in that cutscene, Jeremiah.
[85:42.22]Okay, no, seriously?
[85:42.90]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[85:47.08]Somebody was kneeling down fixing something.
[85:50.40]For a second, they handed in, like, the machine.
[85:53.99]If you paid me $10,000 and said, I'm only going to give you $10,000, if you can tell me one sentence or even a small retelling of what that cutscene was, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[86:05.68]I would not be able to do it.
[86:06.92]I don't think it would work fucking hard.
[86:09.79]I got such, my brain is hurting so bad from that conversation, I would actually, in a Mandela-confused attempt, just say there was something about putting your hand down the fucking drain in the alien cage.
[86:23.19]Like, Master Chief came over and, like, unclogged my pipes.
[86:26.85]That's all good.
[86:27.63]Fucking $10,000.
[86:31.72]I couldn't pay attention to the story because and look what I'm doing doing it again We're doing it right now and don't we're not paying something about teen noble intervention to help secure a sword base Alright, where are you?
[86:44.22]Alright, so?
[86:44.78]This game
[87:01.18]is giving me cataclysmic diarrhea if we continue we need to stop I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna die if I keep playing this my brain is hurting I can't do this anymore
[87:19.99]Cataclysmic Diary.
[87:24.57]Alright, so, what, anything, what would, I just headshot that guy like ten times in a row.
[87:33.94]Let me guess, let me guess, if I paid you like three billion dollars, you would say that Halo reaches a game where Master Chief gets Cataclysmic Diary.
[87:43.27]Yeah.
[87:46.54]This is a fun game, actually.
[87:48.64]They have shields.
[87:49.06]You know what's the worst part of this?
[87:50.30]This is the only time I'm going to be playing Halo Reach and I'm an old man on my deathbed.
[87:55.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[87:56.36]How old are you?
[87:58.40]Like, for real.
[87:59.38]Like, how old are you?
[88:00.50]Not like you're... Like, this is what I say on Twitch how old I am, but I'm actually like three years old.
[88:04.60]I want you to embarrass yourself.
[88:06.12]How old do you think I am?
[88:08.28]Um... How old do I think I am?
[88:11.52]I'm going to say...
[88:14.46]Well, I mean, you've made at least one or two Nintendo 64 references that I've seen.
[88:20.24]So, there's no way that you're... You're older than 20, 21, 22.
[88:24.61]You're probably... I don't think you're 30, though.
[88:28.71]I would say... Yeah, I'm going to say 27.
[88:34.76]Close.
[88:35.10]I'm a little younger, though.
[88:37.42]A little younger?
[88:38.56]Oh, much younger.
[88:43.22]How about this?
[88:44.30]25.
[88:45.36]If I told you that, I seriously thought you were 43, would you believe me?
[88:49.81]Wait, what?
[88:51.25]Just kidding, I was fucking with you.
[88:57.59]43?
[88:57.61]43?
[88:58.81]I don't know if you're asking, if you're shocked as in, like, what the fuck?
[89:02.61]Like, are you... What happened to you, Joel?
[89:07.41]Or are you asking, are you saying 43 as in, like...
[89:11.00]I'm a little younger than that like what are you reacting 43 as in like decade off okay because I thought he were like well you know what 40 how old do you really think I was okay uh I don't know 53.
[89:35.81]If I was actually 53 years old, I would talk like this.
[89:39.52]It would seriously be like this.
[89:41.42]And then this is the only way that you tell that somebody's like over 45 years old is if they speak just like this.
[89:46.66]And this is their actual speaking voice.
[89:48.18]This is how they talk.
[89:49.47]Like if you're 50 years old, it's just how you talk.
[89:53.62]So, I mean, my voice sounds like this.
[89:56.50]Young.
[89:57.58]Elegant.
[89:58.79]Smooth.
[90:00.33]Slightly, slightly moving towards... You know what I love about your voice?
[90:06.93]You describe your own voice as if it is a cigarette filter.
[90:10.24]Ironically, you're saying... Like, you're fucking putting it on.
[90:14.92]You're old as fuck, man.
[90:17.55]You're basically walking, talking nicotine.
[90:22.75]Smooth.
[90:23.19]Elegant.
[90:24.39]May have failed quite a few classes in high school.
[90:28.35]But still made it.
[90:30.85]Barely.
[90:33.40]You're not wrong.
[90:37.64]Wait, hold on.
[90:38.96]What's your opinion on vaping?
[90:44.56]Well, as a gamer...
[90:46.98]As a lifestyle choice.
[90:49.32]I think it's important that we... I was going to give you some shit, but I gave up.
[91:02.23]Are you asking me seriously what I think of vaping?
[91:04.95]Yeah.
[91:09.40]I mean...
[91:14.99]What the fuck do you want me to say?
[91:16.17]You should choose your words more carefully next time.
[91:19.84]Loki.
[91:24.16]Jeremiah, do you vape?
[91:26.98]Are you like a big vape gamer?
[91:40.23]I think I'm going insane, somebody wrote.
[91:43.01]I think I'm going insane.
[91:46.10]I'm fine.
[91:48.18]Oh, by the way, I feel like I've been sitting in the same spot on the same side of the map for, like, an hour and ten minutes.
[91:53.38]I feel like this game is, like, what do you call this, like, old-timey, like, VR goggles, but it's, like, one picture and you switch it out?
[92:02.22]Like, whoop.
[92:03.10]What do you call it?
[92:04.46]Stereo...
[92:06.94]stereo something stereo stereotropic uh 3d with the blue and the red you mean no like Viewfinder I'm talking like 1920s like entertainment a view master view view master yeah okay yeah yeah it feels like that where there's like five pictures that you just kind of cycle around there's not no change and just like nothing changes but the scenery that's this fucking game
[92:32.37]legendary difficulty I saw somebody write hey man you probably shouldn't have done legendary difficulty because I like how the the story there is we had to we have to be like the gamers do I vape I don't know I don't vape and neither does Joel good that was awesome put that in somewhere
[92:58.70]Listen, I don't like that you're assuming that you know me, alright?
[93:04.24]Do I not know you?
[93:05.36]Actually, I don't know you at all.
[93:10.03]I know you very, like, you know, slightly.
[93:13.69]I don't fucking vape, but alright, thanks.
[93:20.29]Are you drinking vape juice right now?
[93:21.91]Is that what you're doing?
[93:23.47]Am I drinking vape juice?
[93:26.46]Yeah.
[93:26.78]Do you know about a thing called Jenkem?
[93:29.78]I don't know what that is.
[93:31.36]You don't know about Jenkem, Jerma?
[93:32.91]Yeah, I know what Jenga is.
[93:34.51]It's a game where you pull blocks out until the house falls down.
[93:39.29]Well, I'll tell you what.
[93:40.85]If you want to read, but... Emphasis on read, but Jenkem is... The stream is done.
[93:48.80]You want to know my official stance on vaping?
[93:51.22]Check out Jenkem.
[93:53.36]I'm kind of scared to do that.
[93:56.20]No, no, it's good and clean.
[94:00.38]What does this ordnance do?
[94:02.34]Get the hell off my lawn.

[94:53.98]It's so annoying.
[94:54.85]Oh no, they locked me out.
[94:56.57]What?
[94:57.75]They fucking locked... No, no, no, wait!

[95:16.35]God damn it.
[95:18.03]I didn't even get to see the thing I did.
[95:19.69]Hey man, you probably shouldn't have done Legendary difficulty.
[95:27.66]Why am I just lying so- What are you talking about?
[95:28.92]We're having the fucking time of our lives.
[95:31.58]Where am I?
[95:33.56]Where am I?
[95:34.60]Hey man.
[95:38.16]Hey man, uh, just so I ask, you probably shouldn't have done Legendary.
[95:42.20]Hey man, just wanted to let you know.
[95:43.40]What am I doing?
[95:43.86]What is this power move thing?
[95:49.27]That wasn't me.
[95:51.37]I'll give you the health.
[95:52.07]Alright, so this is... I'm gonna leave this up to you.
[95:56.69]You have the big red button in front of you.
[96:00.51]And don't press it yet.
[96:01.63]Until you find out what it is.
[96:03.73]I know it's big and shiny and you want to smash it right now.
[96:06.64]But that big red button in front of you... Is the... Is the get out of Halo.
[96:12.48]Like... Get out of Halo and open up viscera cleanup detail.
[96:17.74]That's what the big red button is.
[96:20.89]I want to make sure you're having fun.
[96:22.33]I'm having fun, alright.
[96:31.21]Yo, watch out, dude!
[96:32.77]Oh, I'm having fun, alright.

[97:37.53]Are you controlling it?
[97:40.11]I don't know if I am.

[98:58.35]Yeah, I'm having fun.
[99:00.68]I'm having fun.
[99:04.46]I just saw in my mind, I just saw Joel's hand just hover over that button and just like, God!
[99:10.38]And he almost pressed it.
[99:15.45]Alright.
[99:22.97]Wait, what happened?
[99:24.43]My head... Why did we go... What happened?
[99:26.40]We just started over?

[102:56.64]I was like, who the fuck are they?
[103:03.39]Jerma, I gotta say something.
[103:06.09]I literally clicked on your stream and I opened it and it was like chat is there and there's like some girl sitting in the chair.
[103:11.09]And I was like is this the stream? Is this the video? What's- what am I watching?

[104:00.58]Oh, shit, I pressed it for you!
[104:03.06]See, I got tons of buttons, but you don't understand.
[104:05.02]I've got, on every live stream that I've ever done, there's like 25 different buttons here.

[106:20.38]Hold on.
[106:20.68]The red button was to... Dude, did you choose lower difficulty and get host in Halo?
[106:29.70]Or did you choose Exit Halo, Visceral Cleanup DT?
[106:32.68]Sorry, Jeremiah was getting into my gamer hole there for a second.
[106:35.80]What the fuck was he saying?
[106:38.34]What was he saying?
[106:39.98]Joel, cut the blue wire.
[106:45.79]Lower difficulty.
[106:49.47]Okay, well, we're playing Halo now, or... Oh, God.
[106:53.59]Green...
[106:57.84]I love this.
[106:58.28]This is fucking awesome.
[106:59.55]Alright, so I'm going to look.
[107:02.57]Let me ask you.
[107:05.55]Would you like just no fucking messing around, no jokes, no comedy?
[107:10.55]No.
[107:11.08]Would you like to continue to play Halo?
[107:13.52]Straight up.
[107:14.36]Straight up.
[107:14.74]Let's play some Halo.
[107:16.22]Would you?
[107:17.66]The answer is no.
[107:18.78]Nope, no bit bopping.
[107:20.20]Okay.
[107:21.00]Straight up.
[107:21.48]Alright, just Halo.
[107:24.15]Okay.
[107:24.76]Halo.
[107:26.28]So, the answer to that is no.
[107:32.47]Fuck this game.
[107:33.57]You don't... Oh no.
[107:36.53]Oh no.
[107:41.99]Okay.
[107:42.85]So, uh... I don't want to play anymore Halo, dude.
[107:46.43]If I play more Halo, I'm going to have fucking... I'm going to start vomiting.
[107:50.06]Out of my skull.
[107:51.58]I can't do anymore.
[107:53.71]Alright, quick follow-up question.
[107:55.73]Jeremiah, I just realized something.
[107:58.47]Okay, hold that thought just for a second.
[108:00.35]Just keep it in the oven, alright?
[108:01.97]You know what fucking game we need to play?
[108:03.45]I realize that we are the most inept ever.
[108:06.31]Our brains are not aligned at all to interact with each other.
[108:08.87]We need to play that fucking bomb game.
[108:11.17]You know when you got to defuse a bomb?
[108:12.93]Don't keep talking in the... We would be killer at that.
[108:19.25]Like right now?
[108:20.90]Not right now, but at some point.
[108:29.36]That would be the most fucked bad yes stream ever.
[108:33.88]That would be so bad, people are saying.
[108:36.03]Okay.
[108:37.13]Why don't we just do it right now?
[108:40.39]Do I have it?
[108:40.97]Hang on.
[108:41.95]Let me ask you this question.
[108:46.02]Did you want to play Halo at all?
[108:52.10]No.
[108:52.72]From the very beginning.
[108:53.90]Were you just humoring me that whole time?
[108:59.65]It started off...
[109:01.68]with you presenting these button scenarios for me, and there was something about Wendy's in there, but then I thought about something about the drain pipe and you training snakes, and that steered me off the fucking road for a second.
[109:13.96]And then you watched my stream, and you mentioned there was another streamer on my stream, so I said, okay, I'm clicking out, I'm conking out of this situation, alright?
[109:22.10]And then at some point you started saying, do you want to lower the difficulty?
[109:25.43]And I said...
[109:28.57]No, and then I said, I don't want to play anymore.
[109:30.97]I want to go take a nap.
[109:34.97]I don't want to do this.
[109:36.64]You thought I was like a Halo pro.
[109:41.10]You thought this was going to be so easy.
[109:43.54]So, alright, let me back up completely all the way to the very beginning.
[109:46.85]We're talking two hours ago.
[109:49.36]Or even like four days ago, five days ago, right?
[109:52.34]Okay, okay.
[109:53.44]Hey, so you want, like, let's play Halo.
[109:57.30]You're thinking, oh, this guy's just a Halo channel.
[109:59.85]He's fucking knows what he's doing.
[110:02.21]That's what he does on his channel.
[110:03.43]No fucking point, Jerma.
[110:04.49]Did I refer to you as like, oh, this guy's a Halo channel?
[110:08.67]Like, I might be stupid, but I'm not a fucking amoeba, alright?
[110:11.99]I have some brain cells jumping around in my big peanut, alright?
[110:15.96]Like, you think I'm in a coma?
[110:19.66]Like, you think I woke up one day and I said, yeah, Jerm has a Halo channel.
[110:24.24]Like, yeah, maybe you played Halo down the line, but at no fucking point did I interact with you over the years and say, yeah, he played Halo all his life.
[110:32.29]What the fuck?
[110:34.30]think before you speak what are you saying hey you don't want to talk about reaching into the toilet and like pulling up like drain pipes alright so what are we doing what do we want what do you want to play I'm gonna play I want to um I don't know if I want to play uh bomberman on super Nintendo um
[110:57.95]The bomb game?
[110:58.57]Will you keep talking and nobody explodes?
