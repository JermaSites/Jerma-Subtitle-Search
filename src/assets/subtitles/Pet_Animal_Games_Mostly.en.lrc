[04:06.11]No, I'm not gonna... Alright, let's do it.
[04:08.71]Let's get this going.
[04:10.81]Tonight's a pets and animals stream, and I'll tell you how this happened.
[04:15.89]So pretty much, I'm gonna- we're gonna- intro goes off. We're already here. Let's go ahead and put it on so I can explain why the fuck this is happening.
[04:29.00]Wowee.
[04:32.00]No, it's not an Otto. No. No Otto. It's not an actual pets and animals. It's fake pets and animals.
[04:44.44]Really important though is can you guys actually see this?
[04:53.18]Okay, you can yeah, I can already tell this is gonna be this is gonna be an A plus stream How did we get here listen this is how we got here so I was in chat trying to figure out what I wanted to play tonight and
[05:12.81]And, ah, god, I can already tell this is gonna be a fucking disaster.
[05:15.80]I just already know.
[05:18.58]Um... What is this piece of crap?
[05:27.54]22 pet games that I bought 15 minutes ago, and this is because Everyone wanted me to play neo pets we were hanging out in the chat Just talking you know having a little bit having a little bit of a back and forth and people started talking about neo pets and I made a neo pets account and
[05:44.33]And it's just a static image of a frog.
[05:46.24]It was fucking stupid.
[05:48.18]It's just, you like feed them and sometimes the image will change.
[05:51.60]And there's like hundreds of virus games on that site.
[05:54.86]And I didn't want to do it.
[05:56.26]It looked like it was going to be boring.
[05:58.40]So then I got this bright idea.
[05:59.55]I was going to go on Steam.
[06:00.97]And look, oh, what about like, they have like a Neopets on Steam.
[06:03.93]Or like on GOG or Amazon.
[06:07.21]and then here we are I bought like 20 other virus games on Steam that these are we're gonna play like we're gonna play like 20 pet games each of these we're gonna play for like five minutes okay because it's not gonna be like a seven hour stream tonight how much did I spend not that much because these things are cheap and actually some of these are like 10 25. alright this first one's called why do I do this I don't know why I do this to myself
[06:36.40]Why can't I just play like... This game is $20.
[06:39.97]Is this game $20 on Steam?
[06:41.29]How much was this one?
[06:45.39]I think this game was $10.

[07:21.01]Get out now?
[07:21.89]No, I'm not gonna get out now.
[07:23.55]This game was the more expensive one.
[07:26.03]Plus, half of these games aren't even gonna work, so the ones that actually do work, I gotta give it a little bit of time.
[07:30.40]Alright, character.
[07:35.87]Okay, so you can be... Alright, is there any difference?
[07:40.05]Alright, why is it some of them just have like a different shaped face?
[07:50.57]This guy is this guy.
[07:53.33]Except the hair.
[07:54.27]It's like they removed the eyes and added a little bit more hair.
[08:01.33]This looks kind of good, let's see.
[08:04.78]That's pretty normal here.
[08:06.04]That's the kind of hairstyle.
[08:08.20]I'm bald.
[08:11.08]There's only two hairstyles.
[08:13.60]There's this one and this one.

[11:19.55]Well, where's the town?
[11:23.85]And why are there only dirt roads?
[11:31.44]How far can I take the camera?
[11:32.90]Like, where's the town hall?
[11:38.96]What kind of fucking veterinarian just runs around in a t-shirt?
[11:45.90]Go into town?
[11:48.82]Isn't this the town?
[11:53.87]This is just 3D Stardew Valley.
[12:02.65]What is this?
[12:03.07]A caterer?
[12:04.61]There's a caterer over here.
[12:06.11]Just in case we need to get a couple of fucking trays of lasagna.
[12:10.53]There's a caterer.
[12:13.86]It's some chicken broccoli ziti with some candles under it.
[12:17.46]Oh shit.
[12:19.14]Is this guy holding a goldfish?
[12:21.28]It's our first customer.
[12:22.30]He's holding a goldfish.
[12:24.23]I don't even have any medicine.
[12:26.91]What do you have for an animal?
[12:32.41]Call.
[12:33.46]I don't have any medicine.
[12:40.29]My animal's eye is clearly injured.
[12:42.03]It is red and the animal is clenching it shut all the time.
[12:45.53]It is also very watery.
[12:47.60]Well, how did it happen, sir?
[12:50.96]Examine the eyes of the magnifying glass.
[12:52.56]Okay, eyes.
[13:04.50]I don't know what happened, I dropped my Guinea pig on the ground.
[13:10.63]I just had it, it said eyes.
[13:11.73]Alright, see, if you guys didn't know, you gotta shove a thermometer up an animal's ass.
[13:27.90]That's how you get to tell the right temperature.
[13:30.82]Ultrasound, is the Guinea pig pregnant?
[13:34.59]Let's see.
[13:35.01]I don't know.
[13:37.99]I don't know if the Guinea pig is... There might be a girl in there.
[13:43.25]Nothing special can be seen, huh?
[13:44.65]You're not pregnant.
[13:48.01]Oh, okay.
[13:48.29]You have to just go like this.
[13:49.33]This is dumb.
[13:59.78]Nothing special can be seen.
[14:03.84]What am I supposed to be?
[14:05.64]Wow, are you kidding me?
[14:07.20]What?
[14:07.48]There we go.
[14:10.86]I'm just waving like a magic wand around his head.
[14:15.79]Alright, what's wrong with his eye?
[14:20.61]Got it, alright.
[14:21.45]The eye is pinched and reddened.
[14:23.61]A strong tear flow can be seen.
[14:26.12]On closer examination, a small wound is visible.
[14:30.15]You don't have enough medicine left to perform the treatment.
[14:41.04]You didn't give the animal the treatment it needed.
[14:42.66]Its owner is not happy and won't come back here in a hurry.
[14:45.60]Zero earnings.
[14:48.10]Is that me saying that?
[14:50.92]I gotta get medicine.
[14:52.18]Hold on.
[14:53.64]Excuse me, ma'am.
[14:54.28]I'll be right back.
[14:56.39]I have to actually have a veterinary practice.
[15:01.82]Yeah, you're about to have a real big problem.
[15:11.49]You're gonna have to go to the doctor soon, too, buddy.
[15:13.63]Alright, where's the medicine department?
[15:16.15]Where do I buy medicine in this fucked up town?
[15:20.46]Complete overview.
[15:21.38]There it is.
[15:31.82]Where's the ta- Where's the fucking medicine supply store?
[15:39.24]Additional housing for cats.
[15:44.20]Where do I buy medicine?
[15:51.70]Oh look, this little didgeridoo!
[15:54.74]No, get out.
[15:59.96]Go to the town and stock up on your medicine.
[16:04.00]Yeah, what is it?
[16:05.12]I'm in the town.
[16:08.77]Oh shit, another Guinea pig.
[16:10.11]Wait, wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[16:12.53]Is this going out?
[16:13.91]Of course it is.
[16:15.61]Great, you've managed to find the town.
[16:16.97]Now head towards the pharmacy.
[16:20.49]Once you purchase medication, you can return to the clinic and start your work.
[16:23.03]It will not be long before there is a pet owner in your waiting room.
[16:25.93]Call them in and treat their animal.
[16:27.01]You can get more information by pressing the task button.
[16:29.41]Alright, we're in town.
[16:30.81]Quickly.
[16:31.17]I need to run to grab some eye drops.
[16:35.65]That's the bank.
[16:38.72]You guys didn't think this was going to be open world, did you?
[16:41.74]Pharmacy, pharmacy, pharmacy, pharmacy, pharmacy.
[16:43.88]Good day.
[16:45.42]May I help you with anything else?
[16:47.12]Yes.
[16:48.75]Here, you can buy medicine to treat your patients.
[16:50.27]Thank you.
[16:50.57]Okay, we got anti-parasitic and anti-micotic ointment.
[16:57.62]Yes, I would like one of those.
[17:00.18]Healing ointment.
[17:01.32]Give me one of those.
[17:02.68]Anti-inflammatory.
[17:03.30]Give me one of those.
[17:05.18]Dewormer.
[17:05.66]Give me one of those.
[17:06.34]Antibiotic.
[17:06.78]Give me one of those.
[17:09.74]And... Eye drops.
[17:22.75]May I help you with anything else?
[17:25.93]Take care.
[17:28.35]I spent $550 in the first 10 seconds of the game on a new patio.
[17:33.09]So I guess animals aren't gonna get treated.
[17:34.95]Go this way.
[17:40.44]Back out here.
[17:41.98]Is it really that loud?
[17:51.71]How's that?
[17:52.01]Is that better?
[17:56.87]Can you get, is it, are we good?
[18:00.47]Much better?
[18:00.85]Alright, let's get into the clinic.
[18:06.58]Okay, here we are.
[18:07.68]So we got Guinea pig.
[18:09.36]We have, how many Guinea pigs do we got?
[18:14.78]Customer, call hamster.
[18:18.07]What about this one?
[18:18.67]This is both two hamsters?
[18:20.51]Alright, let's get the hamster.
[18:21.81]I think the hamster guy's been waiting the longest.
[18:23.69]I would like to have my pet vaccinated so it will stay healthy and happy.
[18:27.69]Listen to the chest using the stenographer.
[18:30.49]Measure the enemy's body temperature using the thermometer on its rear.
[18:34.27]Got it.
[18:34.81]Right?
[18:35.01]Told you.
[18:35.91]Up his ass.
[18:36.97]Thermometer.
[18:37.61]Rear.
[18:39.81]Temperature seems okay.
[18:44.78]There it is.
[18:47.52]Uh, now we gotta do a injection.
[18:53.83]Where is it?
[18:55.37]Wait, I just did it.
[18:57.45]Okay, now get down here.
[19:01.07]Where's my vaccine?
[19:02.69]I have one vaccine.
[19:10.62]What's wrong with him?
[19:11.34]Is he dead?
[19:13.90]Oh my god, it's telling me I'm failing it.
[19:15.70]Alright, we're good.
[19:17.48]The heart sounds healthy.
[19:19.27]Give a vaccine injection to the hind legs.
[19:22.31]You don't have the vaccine.
[19:25.83]Thank you for coming.
[19:27.33]Your pet is healthy enough for a vaccine eventually in a while.
[19:31.82]Okay, what about you?
[19:32.50]What does your pet need?
[19:36.05]Next, please.
[19:36.83]I'm worried about my pet.
[19:38.71]Can you please take a look?
[19:39.89]Our pet is sniffling, and its eyes are watering.
[19:41.72]It's not eating properly, and it seems to get tired more quickly than usual.
[19:45.80]Chest.
[19:47.52]Perform a palpitation on the chest using the glove.
[19:50.34]And then shove a thermometer up his ass.
[19:51.84]OK.
[19:51.96]I'm going to use a stethoscope.
[19:58.49]And glove.
[20:00.21]And then we're going to put some antibacterial ointment up your Guinea pig's ass.
[20:05.05]Let's see if that helps.
[20:07.17]Seems to be breathing normally.
[20:08.21]Okay, glove.
[20:10.29]Chest.
[20:11.70]Give him a couple of scratches.
[20:16.64]Hmm, let's see here.
[20:21.08]No, it doesn't feel like it.
[20:21.88]Doesn't feel like it.
[20:26.24]Mm-hmm.
[20:26.96]I felt a lump in there.
[20:28.38]Nothing unusual.
[20:30.39]So now I can do a... What's on the task list?
[20:35.79]Measure the animal's body.
[20:36.71]Okay, thermometer.
[20:40.56]Look, I'm just doing diagnostics.
[20:41.76]It's okay.
[20:43.76]Category.
[20:44.50]Wait, I spelled category wrong?
[20:48.16]No, I didn't, did I?
[20:51.52]Category.
[20:52.53]I got it right now.
[20:59.61]Look, it's been a long day, okay?
[21:03.95]It's been a long day.
[21:08.57]He's got a slight fever.
[21:09.81]Inject an antibiotic into the hind legs and inject a strengthening drug into his hind legs.
[21:14.39]I don't... I don't have any of this stuff.
[21:17.51]I need to restart the fucking game is what I need to do.
[21:20.39]Because I don't have any money.
[21:23.64]I need to buy, at least tomorrow I'll have an upgraded patio.
[21:27.04]Oh my god.
[21:27.32]Examine the chest, magnifying glass.
[21:28.74]I actually need to restart the game.
[21:30.75]Unfortunately.
[21:51.27]Is that Sean Bean?
[21:53.55]It might be.
[21:56.43]Uh, small reddish spots can be seen on the animal's skin.
[21:58.39]Actually, I might be able to get one here.
[21:59.31]Because I have, um... His chest.
[22:05.99]Yeah, I think I'll get this one.
[22:07.21]Because it's going to need to be, like, antibiotic ointment that I'm going to have to spread all over him.
[22:14.06]Put it down?
[22:14.74]No, I'm not going to put the animal down.
[22:17.30]What?
[22:22.06]Alright.
[22:24.98]Disinfect the chest, disinfect the abdomen, apply anti-parasitic, and I got that.
[22:30.19]Okay, disinfect the chest, disinfect the abdomen.
[22:33.77]Why?
[22:34.75]Why do I not have this stuff?
[22:36.73]I don't understand.
[23:02.88]We're doing this right.
[23:03.64]At least once.
[23:08.58]Jeremy's clinic got shut down.
[23:10.90]He didn't buy any medicine.
[23:17.81]Use the money cheat code.
[23:19.15]No, we're not doing that.
[23:19.85]At least I know where to go now.
[23:28.56]Pharmacist, buy medicine.
[23:31.98]Here we go.
[23:32.76]Let's get one of everything.

[23:53.25]Three.
[23:54.66]Cartilage Strengthener.
[23:55.86]Three.
[23:57.46]All of them.
[23:57.94]Just to make sure I can do at least a few pets in a row.
[24:07.95]These are expensive, damn.
[24:15.11]Steve Werber.
[24:16.71]Anti-inflammatory.
[24:17.79]There's 20 more games left.
[24:19.42]I gotta go.
[24:21.10]We gotta do the other ones now.
[24:22.00]Alright, I got everything.
[24:28.06]Do you like a bag?
[24:31.56]No, I wanna carry it around loosely in my arms.
[24:38.53]What about when it expires?
[24:39.89]What do you mean when it expires?
[24:41.01]You think we're gonna play that long to see that play out?
[24:47.65]Split it into two streams.
[24:49.47]I don't know.
[24:51.58]Is this what you guys want to see?
[24:52.76]You want to see terrible fucking pet games?
[24:54.56]Alright, I'm ready for my first customer.
[24:59.56]And I can buy a new TV, can't I?
[25:02.36]Change outfit.
[25:07.59]And at that time, somebody came in here.
[25:09.07]Okay, we got a Guinea pig.
[25:12.23]Sniffling and his eyes are watering.
[25:15.89]Alright, so listen to the chest.
[25:18.39]Listen to the beat.
[25:20.07]Listen to the heart.
[25:21.59]Listen to your heart.
[25:22.45]Listen to the beat.
[25:23.53]Listen to the... That's like, don't hug me, I'm scared, right?
[25:25.69]Something like that.
[25:26.71]That first one.
[25:29.07]Palpitation.
[25:29.57]Measure the animal's body temperature like chest.
[25:31.20]Okay, here we go.
[25:31.70]Fast.
[25:32.52]Fast.
[25:38.73]Come on, hurry up.
[25:40.97]Got it.
[25:43.25]The breathing speed is increased.
[25:45.53]Did I just level the Guinea pig up?
[25:49.30]I had enough experience to do like extra breathing speed.
[25:51.60]Alright, perform a palpitation using the gloves.
[26:00.62]I hate this.
[26:05.73]I hate this fucking feature.
[26:11.41]Alright, we're actually going to get one pet served.
[26:15.12]And the last thing is measure the animal's body temperature.
[26:18.76]Why did I not have to buy these?
[26:25.19]Normal.
[26:28.27]Inject an antibiotic into the hind legs and a strengthening agent.
[26:32.65]I got them both.
[26:34.81]Syringe.
[26:38.97]Well, wait a minute.
[26:40.79]Oh, boy, wait a minute.
[26:41.77]What does it want me to do?
[26:43.94]What color do I have to paint this fucking Guinea pig?
[26:47.54]What was it?
[26:47.94]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[26:50.42]Remember from Putt-Putt's Great Adventure in the Zoo?
[26:53.46]It's those same containers.
[26:55.30]Antibiotic and a strengthening drug.
[26:57.17]Okay, hind legs.
[27:04.67]And a strengthening drug.
[27:12.22]First pet actually treated.
[27:14.48]The treatment was a success.
[27:15.54]The pet can be taken home.
[27:16.46]58 bucks.
[27:18.24]Get well and see you soon.
[27:20.20]Nice.
[27:20.78]Treat a rabbit.
[27:21.40]See you soon.
[27:23.83]See you soon.
[27:24.35]No, actually, you don't want to see me soon.
[27:26.89]Next, please.
[27:27.71]I'm worried about my animal.
[27:29.41]Can you please take a look?
[27:31.23]This sucks.
[27:32.97]This is what the game is going to be the whole time.
[27:34.59]But we're going to do... When we get to our first cat is when we're going to move on.
[27:39.73]No, we're going to move on now.
[27:41.79]What if the other games don't work?
[27:43.25]Then we have to come back.
[27:46.75]I have to go to the next game.
[27:48.63]Wait, hold on.
[27:49.27]Let's get to the first cat.
[27:58.15]Everyone wants me to go so bad.
[28:00.08]Alright, fine.
[28:02.03]But let me like save the game.
[28:04.06]How do I save the game?
[28:08.14]Okay.
[28:08.90]Let's try.
[28:09.76]Alright.
[28:10.06]Quit.
[28:10.94]Let's do the next one.
[28:13.34]Oh god.
[28:13.74]This is really what the next one is.
[28:14.93]Alright.
[28:20.69]This one is called Block Your Ears.
[28:25.49]Block Your Ears.
[28:26.29]Not kidding.
[28:27.09]It's going to be loud.
[28:28.18]All of them will be.
[28:31.10]Did it crash?
[28:37.71]Is it by the same company?
[28:40.33]Block your ears!
[28:46.82]Is this gonna get captured?
[28:47.72]Okay, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:54.45]Hold on, guys.
[28:55.43]Hold on.
[28:57.51]This is, uh... This is, uh...
[29:07.51]This one looks a little weird.
[29:08.67]Okay, we're gonna go with the little boy.
[29:13.65]Customize your character.
[29:15.03]Hold on.
[29:30.50]B, F?
[29:35.00]This is a pet game.
[29:36.04]It is a pet game.
[29:37.36]Don't tell me it's not.
[29:39.38]I'm gonna go with BF.
[29:40.46]This game is called Fetch It Again.
[29:43.84]Fetch It Again.
[29:45.74]Choose your pet.
[29:46.46]Here we go.
[29:46.84]We could do a husky.
[29:52.78]A retriever.
[29:53.56]A dalmatian.
[29:57.96]Where's the dachshund?
[29:59.35]Jerma shepherd.
[30:00.01]Where's the dog?
[30:00.43]Do I have to unlock animals?
[30:02.85]Special dog.
[30:04.63]Okay, well there's a special dog.
[30:05.93]Siamese.
[30:08.15]Cats don't know how to fetch.
[30:09.13]What the hell is this game talking about?
[30:10.27]Alright, we're gonna go with British Blue.
[30:24.13]Um... That's clever.
[30:32.20]Alright, so here we go.
[30:32.82]This is called Fetch It Again.
[30:33.76]So here we go.
[30:34.96]Checkup, feeding, wash and groom, maintenance, petting.
[30:38.28]Okay, let's do maintenance.
[30:42.12]This game lets you clean the pet's home.
[30:43.91]Most indoor activities can make the pet house dirty.
[30:46.73]In addition, the pet brings in dirt from outside.
[30:48.81]Okay.
[30:52.89]Yeah, this cat just shits and pisses all over the house.
[31:01.18]What am I supposed to do?
[31:01.92]Am I supposed to just get it off the screen?
[31:06.66]That is not how you clean a house.
[31:08.48]You don't just push the dirt somewhere else.
[31:10.58]I know, I was fucking 12 once and I pretended to clean my room.
[31:15.53]That's not how it works.
[31:19.13]Alright, where's the, uh... How do I get my other tools?
[31:25.28]I can't pick up shit and piss with a broom.
[31:30.74]Okay, now we're gonna do a Spray Cleaner.
[31:32.16]Alright, give us the mop.
[31:42.74]Look at the stats!
[31:45.05]His stats are going down.
[31:46.23]What do these even mean?
[31:47.39]68 Red, 7... Oh, this is his Confidence, his Bond... Repletion?
[31:56.23]Hygiene, Health, Ability, and Energy.
[32:00.50]There are more stats in this game than there are in a standard RPG.
[32:06.13]He's slowly dying.
[32:07.09]He'll be alright.
[32:08.77]If he dies before I clean the fucking house, then this pet never should have had a chance to begin with.
[32:18.78]Dust and dirt, 9%.
[32:23.54]How do I get the puke stain?
[32:26.27]Should I vacuum up the puke?
[32:28.36]Of course you do!
[32:30.40]Everybody knows you vacuum up cat puke with a handheld map.
[32:33.21]It's much easier.
[32:34.15]What about the gum?
[32:40.85]How do I get rid of the gum?
[32:41.49]Do I have to put the mop in the cat bed?
[32:53.28]Spray it?
[32:54.52]Okay.
[32:55.84]Done.
[32:56.38]The pet house is clean.
[32:59.76]okay feeding feeding your pet will stock up its energy basic diet is always free but the other diets can be bought each diet has benefits let's make this cat a fat anti basic anti-worms very healthy and rich and oily
[33:23.61]Looked like something I'd feed my cat.
[33:25.89]That looks like somebody took a chicken pot pie, put it in the microwave and sat on it.
[33:32.14]Okay, well apparently, apparently he's alright.
[33:34.10]Oh, and it was rotten too.
[33:37.90]Alright, how about, um... How about wash and groom?
[33:42.66]Why is this called fetch and catch?
[33:51.39]How did you get this dirty?
[33:52.76]Alright.
[33:53.90]Glossy aloe vera anti-fungal anti-flea.
[33:56.92]Or how about anti-shit?
[34:03.42]When did you roll around in all this?
[34:04.76]Look at that.
[34:11.97]Look at that.
[34:13.13]Didn't get... That's not even on his body.
[34:15.85]It is a... superimposed image.
[34:24.10]I don't know.
[34:24.48]This hurts.
[34:25.06]I'm not sure if I'm hurting him or not.
[34:28.75]We got that one dead.
[34:29.63]Why is this called fetch and release?
[34:31.71]I don't know.
[34:32.15]Fetch and catch.
[34:32.81]Throw and catch and release.
[34:34.17]I don't understand.
[34:37.41]Let's pet him.
[34:39.99]This game is great for boosting your pet's bond, but be careful not to... Alright, well, we had to go to bed.
[34:50.42]Save complete.
[34:55.14]He's doing alright.
[34:56.36]His confidence is pretty low, though.
[34:59.72]How do I wake him up?
[35:04.86]How long do they sleep for?
[35:05.92]How do I... There we go.
[35:11.32]Okay, gray cat.
[35:12.24]Let's have a pet session.
[35:14.20]Okay, don't overdo it, it says.
[35:24.64]How do you overdo this?
[35:27.06]I'm just kind of pushing him around.
[35:31.12]Why did a red dot sight just appeared on the cat's chest?
[35:37.15]Who's going to shoot my cat in the face?
[35:39.21]Please don't do that.
[35:46.22]I should be more concerned about the guy that's aiming through my window.
[35:53.87]Look at that avatar change.
[36:00.37]What's he doing?
[36:01.73]What is he doing right now?
[36:02.65]He's getting real close.
[36:03.74]Those eyes.
[36:11.38]I think I did something else.
[36:23.74]Hey, you want some very healthy food?
[36:27.20]It's green beans, carrots, tomatoes, corn, butter.
[36:35.68]Look at how cute he is.
[36:39.23]Alright, now, how do I do anything else?
[36:44.37]Did I click the right game?
[36:47.21]Let's go for a checkup.
[36:52.21]I thought that was a woman in the house screaming.
[36:53.69]Alright.
[36:55.03]Cat's fine.
[36:55.63]Keep it up.
[37:02.50]How do you make any money?
[37:08.38]The courtyard is locked for now.
[37:10.22]Either your pet is ill or in need of better property development.
[37:19.21]Property development?
[37:20.35]What are you talking about?
[37:25.99]is there a real estate button feed the cat again alright you can get like basic ground up worms where's your hunger energy's fine land development uh eating eating gives them confidence
[37:55.53]That's hamburger meat sprinkled on Romano... Romano... Romano... Yeah, that's sprinkled on Ray Romano cheese.
[38:04.30]Why can I not say this?
[38:07.20]Maintenance?
[38:07.69]I don't have any money.
[38:16.13]I'm not feeding the cat again.
[38:17.17]That's irresponsible.
[38:28.23]You guys think that this is it?
[38:29.59]We got way more of these to play tonight.
[38:33.31]Alright, go to bed.
[38:35.59]Get some sleep.
[38:37.51]I got five bucks.
[38:42.22]You know, just go to sleep.
[38:43.42]I think I get five dollars every time we go to bed.
[38:50.96]Sleep for until the next day.
[38:54.32]Yeah, I get five coins every time we go to bed.
[38:59.08]And now I know how to play the game.
[39:06.48]Five coins.
[39:06.90]Look at that.
[39:14.13]Whoa!
[39:18.07]What is... Your pet is fine, but the pet house is in a bad state.
[39:20.93]What do you mean it's in a bad state?
[39:22.83]Hold on.
[39:23.13]Wait, wait, wait.
[39:23.57]Maintenance.
[39:24.99]Oh my fucking god.
[39:30.27]Okay, my house is 74% dirt and dust.
[39:41.48]This is not... I don't want to do this.
[39:56.99]Clean it all with fire.
[40:02.25]Can we please go outside now?
[40:03.75]The one dust bunny that you just shove is... What's the point of having this?
[40:14.56]I don't even know.
[40:24.41]What else is left besides the mop?
[40:29.99]Where's this last 3%?
[40:31.22]I don't know.
[40:32.08]Let's go.
[40:32.44]I don't care.
[40:33.30]Alright, how do... I don't think I can do anything here.
[40:39.80]The courtyard is locked.
[40:41.36]Just leave.
[40:41.80]I can't even quit the game.
[40:42.96]How do you quit the game?
[40:43.80]Okay, exit game.
[40:48.83]Get the fuck out of here.
[40:52.13]Nice work.
[40:54.67]To the whole team.
[40:56.49]This is one of those old games that forced you to look at the credits when the game was turned off.
[41:02.56]Remember these?
[41:02.94]Okay.
[41:08.20]That was actually called Fetch It Again.
[41:10.51]And the screen I'm looking at in the background is not the game we just played.
[41:15.67]Fetch It Again.
[41:16.83]There's an actual game somewhere buried there.
[41:19.99]It's alright.
[41:20.57]So let's go with the next one.
[41:24.68]Careful for your ears.
[41:25.42]This one might be loud.
[41:26.32]Sorry about that.
[41:27.00]If it is... This one is called... This one's called Jerry Rice and Nitis' Dog Football.
[41:47.56]So I can't wait to play a full season.
[41:49.62]I'm not gonna do a full season.
[41:56.99]And by the way, if you're curious, I... Turn that fucking down.
[42:04.38]I bought this game, I think, like three years ago.
[42:08.74]And I opened it.
[42:10.30]And I closed it.
[42:12.12]After maybe like ten minutes.
[42:14.08]So I have played this game once before.
[42:16.92]Because I was like, maybe I can make a video of it.
[42:18.54]No.
[42:19.32]No, I couldn't.
[42:23.40]Like three years.
[42:27.15]Let's turn this up.
[42:30.21]Yes, I did pay for this.
[42:31.77]There's a lot of characters in the game.
[42:35.23]Alright, we're gonna go all Doxxon.
[42:38.57]No, you can't.
[42:39.33]We're gonna unlock everything.
[42:40.28]That's fine.
[42:43.74]That's our team.
[42:44.88]We're gonna play at... We're gonna play at... The Golden Cliffs.
[42:56.39]Now it's too loud.
[43:01.97]Welcome to the Golden Cliffs.
[43:05.90]Thanks, Jerry.
[43:08.48]McGrady versus Madison.
[43:10.92]There's like a little stent of his dialog that was recorded over the course of 16 minutes in a booth somewhere in California.
[43:19.65]Hiss or tails?
[43:22.25]Hiss.
[43:23.33]Flip it.
[43:27.37]Come on.
[43:28.95]Oh, I got the dog's ass.
[43:35.97]Let's go.
[43:40.90]First quarter.
[43:41.62]First quarter kickoff.
[43:42.50]We're going to go push right.
[43:44.18]Steady.
[43:47.38]It's alright.
[43:48.16]There's a good enough power.
[43:51.22]I think it was a WASD.
[43:55.50]How do you attack them?
[43:57.49]You just fell down on your own.
[43:58.67]I didn't do anything.
[44:00.76]Now the game is loud.
[44:01.92]Fuck.
[44:05.12]There we go.
[44:05.48]Okay, we're gonna stop the run.
[44:07.98]We're gonna stop the pass.
[44:10.04]Heavy left.
[44:10.94]We're gonna get a touchdown.
[44:18.77]It's alright.
[44:21.77]IGN gave this game a 7 out of 10.
[44:26.26]I mean, I probably would give this a 7 out of 10.
[44:30.98]When it came out.
[44:33.42]Interception, come on.
[44:36.60]This is Football with Dogs, yes.
[44:39.58]Really?
[44:39.92]I mean, when did the game come out?
[44:41.92]Because remember, every year that a game didn't... Let's go before 2010.
[44:49.75]Each year a video game came out the previous year...
[44:53.85]They get like a 10% letter grade increase by today's standards.
[45:00.12]So if this game came out in like 2003, then it gets 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[45:03.44]It gets 5, 10, 15, 20, 21, 22.
[45:04.88]It gets about like 35% higher grade than it would because of inflation.
[45:10.02]It's video game inflation.
[45:21.25]Game came out in 2011.
[45:22.47]Okay, well then it gets a zero.
[45:23.55]That's fine.
[45:32.86]No, no, don't throw a bo- Will you tackle the lady?
[45:36.48]She had somebody wide open too.
[45:38.02]Oh god, they're gonna be in touch.
[45:39.56]Where's my math?
[45:40.50]I'm just- Bite that little dog's head.
[45:46.51]Where's the touchdown?
[45:47.99]You fucking idiot.
[45:50.73]I love how they jump over the rocks too.
[46:00.96]Big money sign.
[46:06.00]Instant stop.
[46:09.92]The Steam page for the game features the IGN review.
[46:15.45]I just want to pass the ball twice and then we can move on.
[46:22.61]Well, that's a touchdown.
[46:24.13]Okay.
[46:24.47]Let me stop that ARF attempt.
[46:27.21]Is that a two-point conversion?
[46:32.51]Alright.
[46:37.72]Let it be my turn.
[46:42.30]We're gonna go da- We're gonna go right up the middle.
[46:44.16]Good thing that girl got her ALF bonus.
[46:52.55]And run.
[46:55.02]Is there anything else I can do besides run?
[46:59.28]How dumb is the AI?
[47:01.46]It's pretty... It's not... Okay, it's not that dumb.
[47:05.67]One bomb pass.
[47:06.67]That's all I do.
[47:07.29]Just Hail Mary.
[47:08.47]Bagpipes.
[47:10.05]Select a treat.
[47:10.73]What the hell does that do?
[47:12.70]Quit scratching!
[47:19.38]Wait, you can cheat?
[47:21.50]You can use performance enhancing drugs during the game on the field.
[47:27.64]Okay.
[47:27.92]Let's go.
[47:31.04]Did I just bump into my own dog and fall down?
[47:49.83]Oh my fucking god.
[47:52.00]How do I throw the ball?
[47:53.32]That's how you do it.
[48:02.48]That's how you get a guaranteed touchdown.
[48:06.89]Yeah, fuck your dog drugs.
[48:08.67]Ain't gonna help you.
[48:12.21]Oh, what's that?
[48:15.47]Almost got it.
[48:19.70]What is this?
[48:23.95]Alright, for a second I was like... Pass it again.
[48:28.77]I'm gonna go... This one.
[48:32.13]Just wanna get one touchdown.
[48:34.85]You know, if... Somebody block him!
[48:42.52]If this game came out, like, right after Austin Powers... I would understand why that guy, this character exists.
[48:49.78]Gonna go with a run play and I'm gonna QB sneak it through as the fat Scottish guy.
[48:57.24]Here we go.
[48:58.76]What?
[49:06.04]That's not fair.
[49:10.32]You shouldn't be able to play as the people versus the dogs.
[49:13.04]That's not cool.
[49:15.81]If I get a football and run, I'm going to be able to beat a dog in football.
[49:19.21]I shouldn't be able to play like this.
[49:24.27]I'm going to do the same exact thing.
[49:30.97]Humans versus animals.
[49:32.07]Humans are going to win every time.
[49:40.17]What doesn't matter like who cares Especially a little dog like that Tiny animals like that I would beat them a thousand times Anyways, let's move on we have more to do we have this one I
[50:06.49]Oh boy.
[50:09.26]Some of these are going to be just the same game that you've seen already like five times.
[50:13.08]Alright, well here we go.
[50:17.66]Here comes this one.
[50:19.02]Hopefully this one works.
[50:19.98]I feel like this is going to break my computer.
[50:21.02]This one's going to probably crash my computer.
[50:26.27]Steam won't even launch this game.
[50:28.11]There we go.
[50:35.11]See if it can get captured.
[50:40.64]And?
[50:41.54]Hey, look at that.
[50:42.62]It's the same fucking exact company.
[50:50.76]This one's called Ride Your Horse.
[50:53.67]Or something.
[50:54.07]Got one of those names.
[51:02.51]Alright, so this one is very, very basic it seems.
[51:05.49]Press enter.
[51:07.05]Quick game career.
[51:09.47]Let's go with quick game.
[51:12.47]Dressage show jumping.
[51:15.07]Ride across the country.
[51:21.23]Alright, we're going to go across the whole country.
[51:28.59]We're going to start here and we're going to go...
[51:31.24]Pass the cardboard cutout, people.
[51:32.76]The first thing's first.
[51:34.27]We have to attempt to run the people over, right?
[51:35.59]I think the mouse seems to be moving.
[51:37.37]You can't run into these people.
[51:38.39]Can the water go get a drink?
[52:04.74]No.
[52:05.46]The water... Wow.
[52:07.48]Yeah, actually, we can do this.
[52:15.94]Okay.
[52:17.42]Apparently, you can't do that.
[52:20.40]These controls are so bad.
[52:22.04]Can I use the mouse and keyboard instead?
[52:26.43]I think I can.
[52:28.35]No, I can't.
[52:32.72]How do you drive?
[52:35.24]How do you ride the horse?
[52:41.77]He's refusing to jump over it.
[52:47.41]Yeah, that's the wow auction house noise.
[52:50.73]Let me go check and see if my Titanite is going to sell.
[52:53.53]No, my Titanium.
[52:54.71]No, my Thorium.
[52:55.55]Sorry, that's the right one.
[53:00.41]Figured it out.
[53:00.89]We're good.
[53:05.29]Now we just ride it into the sunset.
[53:07.56]Although the horse is a little... stamina-wise, just like Red Dead Redemption.
[53:12.46]Just follow the discs.
[53:24.11]Alright, we've seen everything this game has to offer.
[53:26.39]There is nothing else to see.
[53:31.39]Can you imagine selling this game?
[53:36.63]We're gonna check out another course to make sure we're not missing something here.
[53:41.02]Ah, fucko.
[53:41.52]We missed the ARF attempt.
[53:42.70]Oh, no.
[53:47.76]What is this one?
[53:48.56]Is this dressage course?
[53:55.82]So this is just an empty lot.
[53:57.08]What do you do here?
[54:04.26]I think I have to put a show on.
[54:05.44]What is a dress?
[54:06.96]What do you do with a dressage?
[54:08.56]Do I just have to strut my stuff in a straight line?
[54:12.21]Is this like a drunk test?
[54:32.14]Collected... I just have to walk around.
[54:33.70]Yeah, medium trot.
[54:38.18]This seems like a medium trot to me.
[54:41.42]Yeah, collected canter.
[54:44.04]Well, I don't know what that means.
[54:45.32]These are all just saying the same thing.
[54:51.59]Extended trot.
[54:57.35]Yeah, somebody just picked up a thesaurus.
[55:01.04]And is just reading different ways to say this.
[55:04.05]Oh shit, I fucked it up.
[55:05.43]Extended block.
[55:16.12]How am I getting zero points?
[55:19.68]Collected trot.
[55:30.39]Isn't a decanter like a science equipment?
[55:32.83]What's a canter?
[55:35.53]What's a decanter?
[55:36.67]That's like a cup, right?
[55:50.25]This is just another... It's a boiling flask.
[55:53.93]Alright, so a canter is a cold flask.
[56:01.01]Oh, fuck.
[56:01.49]I screwed it up.
[56:02.71]I've ran into the wall.
[56:04.05]Oh, no.
[56:06.05]The judges really saw that one.
[56:07.41]He walked into the wall three times.
[56:11.92]Oh, and he did it in front of the judges, too.
[56:14.26]You just hate to see that.
[56:15.78]That's such a terrible thing to see.
[56:17.06]So that's it.
[56:33.81]Okay.
[56:35.71]That's not the name.
[56:36.80]That's not my horse's name.
[56:41.72]Okay.
[56:47.43]That's it for that one.
[56:52.01]What's next?
[56:55.37]We got Jerry Rice's Dog Football.
[56:57.23]We had...
[57:04.03]This is not a dog or a cat game.
[57:12.68]This was in the dog and cat game bundle.
[57:16.08]I bought a bundle that had all dog and cat games.
[57:22.99]This is not one of them.
[57:26.93]Hold on.
[57:37.22]I guess we're gonna... I guess we're gonna play this.
[57:43.18]If it even captures.
[57:46.30]Let me just do this.
[57:48.77]No.
[58:22.64]This was in the dog and cat game bu- We're gonna fix that real quick.
[58:28.96]Uh, this was in the dog and cat game bundle.
[58:32.38]There we go, there's Patrick.
[58:34.24]No, which one of these is Patrick?
[58:39.03]I think- I think that- this- no, that's not Patrick.
[58:41.33]This is a... This is not pets.
[58:45.79]I- I know, where are the pets?
[58:47.21]Where's the- I would've laughed so hard if we kept going and it was like a dog.
[58:52.75]Is there... It's one of these... No.
[58:55.38]Whatever.
[58:55.74]Let's be like this chick here.
[58:59.96]Freestyle.
[59:00.64]The show must go on.
[59:05.66]Anything goes.
[59:08.38]Design a gown.
[59:10.17]I can only do one.
[59:11.63]I have to do this one first.
[59:13.87]Welcome to Mission Runway.
[59:14.89]I'm your host, Regina Albright.
[59:20.83]Here are the judges.
[59:23.22]I don't- we don't need to- this is all just backstory nonsense.
[59:28.74]So this is the competition?
[59:30.26]Why is there like a life-size girl scout here?
[59:37.00]Is that what that is?
[59:37.56]Okay, let's go.
[59:42.19]The game's gonna go for us.
[59:43.61]Oh god, okay, get some- Get some- guy, there he goes!
[59:48.59]Now it's over, we got our dress selected.
[59:51.29]We got our dress selected.
[59:58.35]How do I zoom into the face?
[60:06.19]Why?
[60:06.49]What am I looking at here?
[60:07.53]Okay, I just painted a cat face on me.
[60:10.47]Why is this the only makeup I can do?
[60:13.44]I can do like a powder face or a cat face.
[60:16.26]We got this.
[60:26.96]Bright blue eyeliner.
[60:30.82]Keep the cat face.
[60:38.57]Let's go with like green, no like pink hair.
[60:43.63]Green eyes.
[60:45.27]Accessories.
[60:50.54]Clothes.
[60:54.72]There's emojis?
[60:55.52]There's emojis in this game.
[60:57.02]Polka dots.
[61:00.46]We're going to go with the lava.
[61:01.90]We're going to go inside of a lava spout.
[61:05.75]Oh, shit.
[61:06.37]Okay, that.
[61:09.13]That looks good.
[61:10.05]Jackets, that's fine.
[61:11.09]Okay.
[61:15.47]Get a little bit of lava there.
[61:16.43]And stripes.
[61:19.97]Stripes.
[61:23.02]And lava.
[61:23.66]No, we'll go with the outer space.
[61:25.33]No, we'll go with the... Let's go with funfetti cake.
[61:31.41]There are no accessories.
[61:32.69]Here we go.
[61:33.25]Gloves.
[61:34.33]OJ gloves are fine.
[61:35.31]I don't have any jewelry unlocked.
[61:37.63]Hats.
[61:41.59]Bags.
[61:41.99]Are you going to carry on a bag?
[61:43.59]That's good.
[61:45.77]Make it gold.
[61:47.19]Glasses.
[61:48.95]Make it nice and weird and funky.
[61:50.35]Make it nice and funky, man!
[61:53.45]Oh, nice.
[61:53.89]Oh, it's a funky.
[61:56.60]These and a shawl.
[61:58.86]Alright, there we go.
[61:59.40]Now she's like a fucking pirate.
[62:00.80]She's a pirate panther.
[62:03.64]Red Baron Pizza.
[62:04.68]That looks good.
[62:08.18]And... Lights, camera, action!
[62:11.19]Confirm the design.
[62:12.19]Yes.
[62:19.17]Let's see how they look on the runway.
[62:38.29]Look at the judges' faces.
[62:42.01]The judges' faces are like speechless.
[62:50.53]It's like, wow, how do we tell this person to go fucking home?
[62:53.24]Do they hold up signs like 0 out of 10?
[63:02.34]Why are they, this is a long shot.
[63:04.74]It didn't take me this long to get out here.
[63:12.07]Oh, your look sucks.
[63:13.29]Not even close.
[63:16.27]Tiffany.
[63:17.53]Go back to the drawing board.
[63:18.73]It's a white t-shirt and a fucking shitty little skirt.
[63:22.29]Did you see my molten lava inspired cat person?
[63:28.05]Yeah.
[63:29.45]Not good.
[63:34.79]Yeah, let's get some- that's boring.
[63:46.06]Where are her shoes?
[63:48.24]Where are her shoes?
[63:50.72]Is that a summer look on the beach?
[63:52.82]I don't understand.
[63:59.37]Alright, who wins?
[64:00.31]Alright, now this is a little bit better.
[64:04.49]This one's designed by Jarba.
[64:09.67]Polka dots that zoom in on one of the audience members with a blank stare.
[64:16.72]They all do the same fucking thing.
[64:18.46]No shoes either.
[64:22.03]None of the judges seem to be that impressed.
[64:33.17]You can't say there were no pets or animals involved because I had a fucking cheetah person.
[64:41.48]Listen how loud this is in my ear.
[64:45.28]I can't even wear it.
[64:46.62]Alright, is that it?
[64:50.53]How many more people are in this competition?
[64:52.13]Alright, that's just... Clearly, that's just Dante from Devil May Cry.
[64:58.55]There's no difference at all.
[65:04.30]I think this one's gonna win.
[65:14.48]Click the check in the corner, but that's gonna skip them all, don't we wanna see?
[65:18.77]These brick shoes.
[65:27.79]Yeah, but don't we, is this gonna skip the whole thing?
[65:32.14]Might skip the whole thing.
[65:36.30]Don't you dare skip, how many are there?
[65:38.20]Oh my god, I just realized there's like fucking 30 people in this competition.
[65:45.63]Oh my god, we're gonna be here for a long time.
[65:47.99]Boo, get it out of here.
[65:51.67]This outfit's terrible.
[65:53.73]Same thing, it's a typical tank top with a picnic basket fucking miniskirt.
[65:59.82]No shoes, get it out of here.
[66:01.84]Boo.
[66:01.98]What do you mean it's clipping?
[66:05.59]What's clipping?
[66:07.27]The clothes?
[66:07.87]Oh yeah, I would assume.
[66:12.32]Why are they all holding a pizza?
[66:13.58]They're doing an imaginary waiter thing here.
[66:16.30]I don't get it.
[66:16.78]Imagine this is on TV.
[66:24.31]The expressionless judges don't make any sense.
[66:27.05]They really don't.
[66:30.69]There we are.
[66:32.86]Now you got me.
[66:33.68]Now you got me with the female Wario.
[66:35.68]Now I'm interested.
[66:36.42]This one's a high up on the list.
[66:39.50]Say he likes it.
[66:41.31]Fucking Moby likes it.
[66:54.38]Oh my god, I can't do it anymore, I have to get out of here.
[67:03.22]With the black gloves.
[67:05.34]They don't, nobody reacts.
[67:14.38]That's a pretty good cheese nip costume here.
[67:21.44]And again, basic, terrible.
[67:24.90]Paul designed this one.
[67:27.34]Sunglasses.
[67:30.02]Checkerboard pattern.
[67:33.99]That's like a 1998 outfit.
[67:37.59]At least this person has shoes and socks on.
[67:45.43]Not a great look.
[67:49.17]I appreciate the attempt with the star necklace there, like at least you're trying to add like an accessory.
[67:54.58]Cut.
[67:57.70]I'm just not gonna cut it.
[67:58.42]It doesn't even fit her.
[68:06.59]That's a size too big for that lady.
[68:12.88]Oh boy.
[68:14.47]This one's by Daniel.
[68:18.43]I like this one.
[68:20.31]Wait, is it zoom- is it- I think it's zooming in on the people that made the costume, the outfit.
[68:29.00]This is like Morpheus Crocodile Lady.
[68:35.32]Those are very clearly Morpheus sunglasses, right?
[68:42.81]Those are knitted pants.
[68:43.81]Are they really?
[68:49.32]It's a honeydew melon.
[68:56.86]Honeydew melon.
[69:02.02]This person has ice skates on.
[69:05.98]Nice job, Martin.
[69:06.80]I like it.
[69:07.20]There you go.
[69:10.82]Nice work.
[69:11.34]This one's pretty good.
[69:14.61]There's a lot of contrast here.
[69:15.89]This is like Starry Night's guy.
[69:18.15]I see where the inspiration was.
[69:19.67]It was Van Gogh's Starry Night was the inspiration.
[69:22.99]And the hood, this is a piece that you gotta pay attention to.
[69:34.81]Somebody just said it looks like a Russian hacker.
[69:46.50]It's a fucking Russian hacker.
[69:50.20]Oh my God.
[69:51.00]Oh, get out of here.
[69:52.58]Get out of here.
[69:53.08]Like Kim wore this like to bed last night.
[69:55.98]This is literally just like pajamas.
[70:00.42]James, you're the worst.
[70:01.62]Look at his costume.
[70:03.49]Your outfit sucks, James.
[70:05.81]Go back to Humpty Dumpty where you fucking belong.
[70:10.93]You just went to fucking Kohl's and went to the women's pajama section.
[70:18.28]Fucking dickhead.
[70:26.92]This is a Pets Game stream, remember guys.
[70:32.32]The outfit that James is wearing is better than the one he made for the show.
[70:40.79]Alright, we got an accessory here.
[70:46.13]Alright, this is what every small child dresses themselves like.
[70:53.71]Do you know anybody?
[70:54.51]Do you have like a niece?
[70:56.55]Because this is what your niece probably was wearing right now.
[71:00.82]Just like fucking around in the closet and putting on random clothes and carrying around a bag.
[71:04.82]The only thing that's missing is the oversized sunglasses.
[71:08.84]Like wearing mom's sunglasses.
[71:17.67]This is just, like, little girl got, like, just got into, like, mom's closet and was just fucking around.
[71:27.81]It was designed by a... Oh, okay, wait.
[71:30.75]Let's see what our judges thought of them.
[71:36.29]That was a poor first start.
[71:37.46]I feel the worst for you.
[71:38.46]The clothes looked fab, and I really liked your coordination of the materials.
[71:44.58]Wait, that couldn't be more hot and cold.
[71:46.88]Even taking into account this is your first challenge, I'm not sure you have what it takes.
[71:51.69]Oh, no.
[71:56.53]Mission Runway is all about potential, and even though this is only the first week, I can't see you getting very far in this competition.
[72:02.17]The politest thing I can say about your makeup is that it looks- it lacks finesse, and that would mean- What?
[72:09.27]Wait, so one of us has to leave?
[72:15.44]Okay.
[72:16.60]Who's leaving this week?
[72:19.14]One of you will have to leave Mission Runway Studio.
[72:21.10]Who will it be?
[72:25.84]It's gonna be James.
[72:28.36]It's gonna be James.
[72:29.58]No, it's Daniel.
[72:31.02]It's Daniel.
[72:34.38]See you later, Daniel.
[72:37.52]See you next week.
[72:39.80]I get to play another round.
[72:44.39]Congratulations, you're going to the next challenge.
[72:48.55]What was Daniel's clothes?
[72:50.15]What did Daniel have for clothes?
[72:54.86]Alright, now how do I keep, how do I keep going?
[72:58.46]Fashion of the Opera.
[73:00.24]Okay.
[73:01.28]Oh, fuck me, man.
[73:03.48]Did this just turn into, next?
[73:05.87]Would, uh, I kind of have to go until I lose, guys.
[73:09.17]I don't know if you know how this works.
[73:12.95]From bargain bin to high class, our contestants design a gown to dazzle the crowds.
[73:23.02]Do not do it again.
[73:24.89]Oh, God.
[73:25.51]Our judges this evening are these guys.
[73:31.73]Okay, whatever.
[73:32.83]I need to make a dress.
[73:35.52]The game crashed.
[73:38.54]Mission runway executable has stopped working.
[73:42.70]So we lose.
[73:44.22]Let's just pretend we went home.
[73:45.29]Because there it goes.
[73:57.60]I mean, I guess some part of me is disappointed in that.
[74:05.50]I tied for first.
[74:06.58]Are you serious?
[74:08.60]Alright, well, let's open up the next game.
[74:13.54]The show must go on.
[74:21.13]I think double-clicking on this may have hard-locked the whole computer.
[74:24.11]No, I think we're alright.
[74:28.50]I was getting into hating on James.
[74:32.07]This one is called... Before we even start this one, let's make sure that we're all aware of how this one is starting.
[74:46.57]As you can clearly see, this is not the same game.
[74:50.87]I promise you that.
[74:56.13]This one is a different game.
[75:00.87]We already played this.
[75:02.65]We're gonna go with Satan Boy.
[75:07.80]We already did this.
[75:08.70]Jerma Shepherd.
[75:09.40]No, we'll do Golden Retriever.
[75:14.10]Why is this the same game?
[75:25.09]This is the same video game.
[75:28.91]What?
[75:29.35]No.
[75:29.63]Get out of here.
[75:30.13]What are you talking about?
[75:30.83]This is not fetching... This is not fetching catch.
[75:41.63]Did it... Did the two games have the same name?
[75:48.70]My Best Friends Cats and Dogs.
[75:51.46]Fetch it again.
[75:55.95]Okay, I just... I need to see this for a second here.
[75:57.89]Because this one's called Fetch It Again.
[75:59.57]I gotta make sure I clicked on the right one.
[76:09.46]I must... I... I must have clicked the wrong fucking game.
[76:12.21]Because this is different.
[76:18.57]No, it's not.
[76:19.73]No, it's not.
[76:20.11]Is it...
[76:25.85]No, see?
[76:28.67]I didn't even click on the same game.
[76:30.37]See, there's Gray Cat.
[76:32.79]Holy shit.
[76:33.60]Wow, what a scam.
[76:40.00]Thanks a lot, Harold.
[76:45.26]You guys actually watched me get scammed on stream.
[76:49.88]I purchased the same game like two or three times.
[76:53.55]Let's check the other ones here.
[76:56.87]We actually have a couple that aren't pet related that somehow found our way into the bundle.
[77:00.29]We have to play them.
[77:01.95]So stick around.
[77:02.91]Because one of them that we're going to play in maybe like 30-40 minutes or so is my boyfriend.
[77:08.24]He loves me.
[77:08.94]He loves me not.
[77:10.30]I don't know how this got in.
[77:12.42]Just like Project Runway got in here somehow.
[77:19.36]These ones are going to be so bad.
[77:20.54]I don't even want to play them.
[77:27.88]We already did this shit already.
[77:29.67]Like, I don't even want to play these.
[77:30.99]I don't want to play these.
[77:36.11]But yeah, I guess I have to.
[77:37.15]Here we go.
[77:38.19]This one's called My Pet Hotel.
[77:49.29]Watch this one be the same game again.
[77:55.43]There it is.
[77:57.01]It should work.
[77:58.43]Does it work?
[78:06.40]I just have a white screen.
[78:08.46]I don't have an actual game here.
[78:11.26]Nope.
[78:12.22]It actually stopped working.
[78:13.46]We're going to try this one more time and then we're going to open up Pet Hotel 2.
[78:20.36]If it doesn't work.
[78:29.17]It works.
[78:31.27]New game.
[78:33.21]Medium's fine.
[78:36.31]Choice of scenario.
[78:38.43]All good things have small beginnings.
[78:40.57]Time for expansion of cats and little tigers.
[78:44.14]Don't let things go to the dogs.
[78:46.54]Horsey business.
[78:48.12]The little animal circus.
[78:52.32]I can't select these.
[78:53.94]I can only do the first one.
[79:01.74]All great things have small beginnings.
[79:04.50]Here you stand at the front.
[79:06.82]Wow!
[79:09.66]Why did that happen?
[79:11.26]Their welfare.
[79:13.02]You have now inherited this pet hotel from a- No, dude!
[79:16.88]Wow!
[79:18.90]Wow.
[79:31.85]It's gone.
[79:35.09]This is just the vet game again.
[79:36.91]God damn it.
[79:37.77]Okay, let's do it again.
[79:51.14]Don't scream at me, please.
[79:55.06]All great things have small beginnings.
[79:57.64]Here you stand at the front door of your very own...
[80:06.14]You have now inherited this pet hotel from a great uncle who re- It just chooses a word to make extremely loud.
[80:20.34]Hold on.
[80:21.62]Third time's a charm.
[80:22.60]This is third time's a charm.
[80:26.92]We're gonna try this last time.
[80:28.22]Ayayayay.
[80:33.74]I'm gonna take my hands off the fucking keyboard.
[80:36.70]They're in the air.
[80:38.26]All great things have small beginnings.
[80:41.02]Here you stand at the front door of your very own pet hotel.
[80:44.06]We made it so far?
[80:45.00]You enjoy looking after animals and taking care of their welfare.
[80:49.55]You have now inherited this pet hotel from a great uncle who recently passed away.
[80:54.91]He left it to you with the request to properly manage it so that it becomes one of the best and most popular in the country.
[81:02.51]I'm afraid to touch anything.
[81:03.57]Your first test will be to take care of five tortoises and five rabbits and eventually return them healthy and contented to their owners.
[81:13.76]Are they gonna race?
[81:14.56]Is that what this is?
[81:15.26]Good luck in the running of your own pet hotel.
[81:17.66]Okay, I'm touching it.
[81:18.34]Prepare yourself to take care of the animals unselfishly and with kindness.
[81:24.12]This just reminds me of- And have you guys ever played Twinson's Odyssey?
[81:32.41]This is Twinson's House from Twinson's Odyssey.
[81:34.85]Little Big Adventure 2.
[81:35.57]It just is.
[81:39.47]Oh boy, what is going on here?
[81:44.91]Speaking of that, I should play Twinson's Odyssey.
[81:47.68]That game is fucking awesome.
[81:48.78]Alright, what do I do?
[81:52.51]Besides, get scared at this guy.
[81:56.45]Special food.
[81:59.25]I don't... Where's my money?
[82:04.37]Alright, what about rabbit food?
[82:09.11]Why is this guy's face here?
[82:10.53]Is it gambling?
[82:11.25]Okay, I got rabbit hoop.
[82:15.59]Uh, nesting box.
[82:16.61]I got some food trays.
[82:25.44]Okay, got plenty of food.
[82:26.16]Where's the first customer?
[82:29.74]Alright, there's the old lady, first customer.
[82:31.70]No, that's just grandma.
[82:34.21]Alright, what do you want?
[82:36.51]Uh... Hunger low, hygiene low, treats low, attention...
[82:51.81]I never understood toilet, like, at what point do you just own a rock?
[82:58.17]Right?
[82:59.57]I don't need to feed it.
[83:00.43]I don't need to bathe it, really.
[83:02.89]I don't need to have any exercise.
[83:05.55]I don't even need to give it treats.
[83:06.65]I don't even need to pay attention to it.
[83:09.81]Just go get a fucking cinder block and put it in your living room.
[83:15.19]We love Aggie so much, but we can't take care of her for three days.
[83:20.95]Would you be able to look after it for that time?
[83:23.85]Actually likes cucumber.
[83:25.51]Play with bite ring.
[83:28.13]Place is still available.
[83:29.43]Feast for this animal.
[83:31.21]Three days for 20 pounds.
[83:35.39]Sure.
[83:35.75]So long.
[83:37.49]Goodbye.
[83:38.69]So where do I store the animals?
[83:45.66]It's a theoretical storing of animals.
[83:55.38]Is there anything else I can do?
[83:56.88]Because I don't see any tortoises.
[83:58.18]If I come to another customer, it's gonna be a rabbit.
[84:04.46]Wait, what about over here?
[84:05.14]Is this the tortoise den?
[84:12.20]Where do the rabbits stay?
[84:13.22]Up here?
[84:13.54]Oh shit, there's the tortoise!
[84:19.10]I see, I see.
[84:22.23]Good day to you.
[84:23.21]You're very welcome.
[84:24.53]Yeah, go ahead, bring another dumb tortoise in here.
[84:26.10]See you soon.
[84:27.36]Bye.
[84:27.54]Alright, let's go.
[84:29.08]We're going to play feed the lolly, feed cucumbers.
[84:32.50]This is Adgy.
[84:34.86]Adgy likes cucumbers.
[84:35.98]Here you are.
[84:36.58]Here comes another one.
[84:41.82]Alright, and we're going to play spot the eye.
[84:51.60]No, I just actually stare at them.
[84:53.70]That's really dumb.
[84:59.73]Good pet.
[85:01.55]What am I doing?
[85:02.51]Oh, okay.
[85:05.31]Alright, this was fun.
[85:11.98]Here comes all of the credits again.
[85:15.78]Panini.
[85:16.30]That's not a great name for a company.
[85:18.34]It's the name of a sandwich.
[85:25.44]Do I even dare double click on My Pet Hotel 2?
[85:30.91]It's probably going to be the same game.
[85:33.45]With absolutely no differences.
[85:35.93]They probably added like three.
[85:37.71]It's going to be what amounts to DLC.
[85:42.06]That they made another game to make more money.
[85:46.48]Okay.
[85:47.22]Let's do it.
[85:54.08]I bought the damn thing.
[85:55.42]Might as well play the fucking thing, you know?
[85:59.46]Young Entertainment.
[86:00.18]There it is.
[86:00.60]Panini.
[86:01.07]There it is again.
[86:01.73]Electronic Arts.
[86:04.67]Or LucasArts.
[86:05.79]Hey, please confuse people to have the LucasArts logo.
[86:12.47]New name.
[86:13.51]This one's a little different.
[86:26.66]This one you can actually have hairstyles.
[86:29.00]I like this one.
[86:33.02]Can I put like a chin strap on this like eight-year-old?
[86:36.31]Alright, that works.
[86:39.49]Let's go.
[86:44.99]Play.
[86:47.19]This one seems very different.
[86:48.45]I don't know why.
[86:49.98]Normal game, free game.
[86:51.94]Riding.
[86:54.50]I ride on a dog?
[86:58.45]No, it's one of these.
[86:59.21]How do I go faster?
[87:13.13]Nope, that's not how you do it.
[87:24.13]I love how we got the Daria theme song playing in the background.
[87:43.49]I don't even want to play the actual game, but that's what we're gonna do.
[87:46.39]Your pet hotel.
[87:48.75]Small pet hotel becomes really big.
[87:51.51]What a success story.
[87:53.61]A Paradise on Earth for Bello, Mitzvah, and Paul.
[87:57.59]I don't want to get political, but that was a Trump line right there.
[88:03.04]That was a Trump line.
[88:04.30]Owners, animal lovers, and animal protection groups are unanimous in proclaiming that whether it be tortoises, kittens, or ponies, these four-legged
[88:15.98]Come on like just listen to this and imagine this is this kind of sounds like Trump to like this is Donald Trump your pet hotel Small pet hotel becomes really big.
[88:26.61]What a success story a Paradise on Earth for bellow Mitzi and Polly Wow, there's nowhere better Come on That was like a breath was pretty much a Trump tweet alright
[88:44.96]Hello, and welcome to your pet hotel.
[88:47.63]If you listen carefully to me, you will learn everything there is to know about how to successfully build up the hotel.
[88:54.19]Oh my god.
[88:57.55]Of course!
[88:58.73]Oh no, they do fucking like Warcraft acknowledgment movement voice lines.
[89:08.46]Roger that.
[89:09.50]A sound plan.
[89:10.84]Gotcha.
[89:13.61]Oh, thank god they don't.
[89:14.35]They actually don't.
[89:14.83]Yeah, they do.
[89:15.09]This is the same game, but they made the movement way more complicated.
[89:42.77]How do I get this out of the way?
[89:46.63]That's the same lady.
[89:55.45]Splatoon?
[89:56.35]That does sound like Splatoon as well.
[89:59.68]Computer.
[90:00.34]Buy luxuries.
[90:01.10]I don't know what that is, but what's the most expensive thing here?
[90:11.66]How can I not afford... Somebody explain this to me.
[90:16.69]How can I not afford this?
[90:19.99]This everlasting gobstopper.
[90:21.89]But I can afford this.
[90:24.41]It's the same price.
[90:27.61]A tuna sandwich with the middle cut out.
[90:29.29]Alright, I bought it.
[90:32.61]And I bought a rotten Cheeto.
[90:35.29]What else can I buy?
[90:36.90]Not much.
[90:43.60]Not possible.
[90:44.58]I can't.
[90:46.32]Wardrobe.
[90:53.23]I can't buy.
[90:53.83]I don't have anything.
[90:55.09]I can't buy anything.
[90:57.49]How do I?
[90:58.11]Where's my pet hotel?
[91:00.39]I can't.
[91:00.80]Very good.
[91:01.34]Now try turning the mouse wheel.
[91:04.00]This lets you zoom in and out.
[91:05.56]Turn the mouse wheel.
[91:06.50]Yeah, here you go.
[91:10.08]Splendid.
[91:11.36]Now you can learn how to rotate the view.
[91:13.62]Little Gary.
[91:15.43]Thank you.
[91:15.89]Computer!
[91:18.31]Get in there!
[91:19.01]Feeding bowl.
[91:42.99]Buy food.
[91:43.41]Now using the arrow key.
[91:44.59]Did the music just correspond with everything I just did there?
[91:49.79]I bought... Rodent mix?
[91:54.67]Rodent mix.
[91:55.03]You did that very well.
[91:57.41]The food is made out of rodents?
[91:59.01]Not everything can be purchased using the computer.
[92:01.61]There is a button in the computer menu.
[92:07.31]I can't... This music is going to get to me real quick.
[92:09.85]Now you can buy...
[92:15.77]Bread.
[92:18.09]Worms.
[92:18.57]And larvae.
[92:20.95]Alright.
[92:21.35]Treats.
[92:22.17]Toys.
[92:24.57]Fish medicine.
[92:25.81]There's a lot of shit here.
[92:29.44]Okay, let's go.
[92:29.98]No, I don't want to hear the tweet again.
[92:34.60]Alright.
[92:34.84]Get.
[92:34.92]Of course!
[92:50.81]What did I not do here?
[93:01.50]Background music needs to be unassuming and be able to sit there without causing a problem.
[93:08.91]This shit is so unbearable.
[93:14.37]It was cool for the first 10 seconds.
[93:22.40]How do I buy it?
[93:24.46]Your pet hotel.
[93:25.52]No!
[93:36.73]I somehow ended up in a skill tree.
[93:43.87]So the final thing is I can summon animals.
[93:48.77]So we got the three different paths to go.
[93:51.31]Fish is definitely dexterity.
[93:54.27]Hawk is gonna be strength and speed.
[93:56.19]And the rapid's gonna be a balance between the two.
[93:58.87]So do we want dexterity, speed, or balance?
[94:04.87]Down here you get the bull charge.
[94:06.03]That's the... You can put three points in that.
[94:08.53]It's 30% damage per point.
[94:12.96]Looks like you can combine, you can turn the bull charge into... It's kind of like Path of Exile where it doesn't matter what weapon you use, but different things can be combined and you can make kind of your own abilities.
[94:26.00]You know what fucking dumb joke I'm making?
[94:27.88]Like, we're going to move on to the next game.
[94:30.76]That's usually where the exit game is.
[94:35.49]First of all, let's find out who the voice actress is.
[94:48.53]They won't even tell me.
[94:50.27]Won't even tell us.
[94:55.31]Nope.
[94:57.57]Oh, well.
[94:59.17]It's too bad.
[95:01.58]Well, that was My Pet Hotel and My Pet Hotel 2.
[95:09.16]Now we're going to move on to... This one's called Paws and Claws Pampered Pets.
[95:22.66]Alright, so I have Malwarebytes, right?
[95:25.10]Oh God, look at this offering.
[95:28.57]I wish you just saw that splash screen.
[95:30.17]It was perfect.
[95:30.95]Hold on.
[95:39.85]I have Malwarebytes, like I was just saying.
[95:43.72]And I went to go capture.
[95:46.10]I went to go to do game capture.
[95:48.64]And when I clicked it down, I saw the word Malware.
[95:52.83]And I got really scared for a second.
[95:57.80]Alright, that's good.
[96:01.42]Noises.
[96:03.02]Voices.
[96:03.80]Music.
[96:04.18]I think that's alright.
[96:13.05]Turn it up a little bit.
[96:13.89]That's fine.
[96:15.35]Back to main menu.
[96:16.95]New game.
[96:22.35]You guys can't see this.
[96:25.27]Our screens are very different.
[96:29.01]I don't know how this happened.
[96:35.14]You absolutely are seeing something that you shouldn't.
[96:38.08]I don't even know how this is possible, so I'm going to turn the facecam on.
[96:41.08]Because I don't even know what you're seeing here and how it's even possible.
[96:46.04]The colors are even different.
[96:48.98]Look at this shit.
[96:56.42]I'm just capping the game.
[97:03.42]So, ready?
[97:05.92]Let's full screen this so you can see what I'm talking about.
[97:11.63]Okay, so.
[97:17.11]Well, that doesn't look right, now does it?
[97:22.33]Give me a second.
[97:25.36]Alright, I can't- I can't do that.
[97:30.85]Shit.
[97:31.37]I can't do that.
[97:31.99]Hold on.
[97:38.77]Okay, here we go.
[97:41.40]So, why am I shi- You guys are- That's what you guys can see.
[97:43.86]You guys can already see this.
[97:46.24]What the fuck?
[97:50.39]That's not, that's different for you.
[97:51.87]See how it's different for you?
[97:54.05]It's different for you again.
[97:56.01]Seems.
[97:59.35]This is what you're supposed to be seeing.
[98:01.86]But instead you're seeing that.
[98:04.20]And before you were seeing something else.
[98:06.80]We've gone upside down, but this is what, that's what I see.
[98:11.60]Okay.
[98:11.82]So I'm going to go ahead and, there's my like swimming guy.
[98:23.04]Alright.
[98:24.86]Cool.
[98:26.88]I don't know why you're seeing this.
[98:32.22]I've absolutely... Not only is it upside down... Hold on.
[98:44.33]The world doesn't make any sense right now.
[98:51.00]Malware.
[98:51.32]Malware.
[98:54.04]Move this.
[98:59.26]What the fuck?
[99:00.50]Why is it doing that?
[99:04.99]We're just not supposed to play this game.
[99:08.43]I'm just gonna leave it as is.
[99:14.75]Why is it so squished?
[99:26.42]What is it?
[99:30.46]Oh!
[99:37.54]I got it.
[99:38.68]Nobody move.
[99:39.64]Nobody breathe.
[99:41.79]Okay, we're good.
[99:43.79]A new mission is ready.
[99:44.57]Open up your PDA.
[99:45.33]A new mission ready.
[99:47.69]Wash three dogs and take one dog for a walk.
[99:52.25]Okay.
[99:59.13]I'm gonna wash three dogs.
[100:00.15]Double-clicking runs.
[100:04.50]Okay, we got a health bar here.
[100:05.48]Do I have to kick this guy's ass?
[100:11.30]Oh, no, no, no.
[100:12.00]That's the dog's health bar.
[100:13.10]Why does the dog have a health bar?
[100:19.28]I think I have to be behind the desk.
[100:20.89]I don't understand.
[100:22.55]What am I supposed to do?
[100:32.85]So, I can't go in here.
[100:34.05]Why are you upside down?
[100:41.16]That's not... That's not what it's supposed to look like.
[100:50.57]You better be good.
[100:51.87]My pet deserves the best.
[100:53.15]I'll take your dog for a walk.
[100:56.48]Do I get a leash?
[100:57.00]Do I have to put a leash on the dog?
[100:58.36]The dog just follows you.
[101:01.28]You guys are looking up underneath glass.
[101:08.99]How long do I have to take the dog for a walk for?
[101:11.75]I can't control the game.
[101:12.97]I don't have control anymore.
[101:13.93]It's over.
[101:16.73]The game is playing itself.
[101:18.21]Let's see what it does.
[101:22.32]Take the dog for a walk.
[101:24.76]The game says.
[101:26.44]As I very clearly lose the dog.
[101:29.24]I'm not with the dog anymore, I'm just going for a run.
[101:35.38]I think I lost the dog.
[101:37.48]I don't think that lady's gonna get her dog back.
[101:39.00]I just ran to the- no, there we go.
[101:45.98]Alright, follow me.
[101:53.43]No.
[101:54.69]I'm calling the dog.
[101:59.53]This game is malware.
[102:01.67]Alright, $50.
[102:03.05]I got $50 from that scumbag.
[102:06.27]Alright, thank you.
[102:08.23]Alright, give me the axe.
[102:17.04]Again, I have no control of the character.
[102:18.36]Goddammit, why?
[102:23.80]Here we are.
[102:25.62]There seems to be a threshold that when we cross it, you guys seem to go upside down.
[102:35.30]You can keep the dog now.
[102:44.09]Logistically, this doesn't make any sense to me.
[102:46.45]It's just capturing the game.
[102:53.29]Many thanks, see you later.
[102:55.41]Can I correct it if I go outside?
[102:57.23]Is this MY car?
[103:04.40]Why am I about to go on a plane?
[103:09.42]What?
[103:16.11]What the fuck is going on in this game?
[103:24.69]Whose car is this?
[103:25.74]Why do I own this car?
[103:35.13]That is like an obnoxious car to own.
[103:41.06]There are no other customers.
[103:44.72]Alright, wait.
[103:45.88]There's a customer.
[103:46.64]You want me to walk your dog?
[103:51.24]Yeah, I'm looking for a little pet sitting.
[103:59.91]Again, I don't have any control.
[104:15.58]Where are we going to?
[104:16.70]Where are we going for a walk?
[104:18.84]This music is killing my soul.
[104:25.30]Are we actually gonna next here?
[104:27.20]I'm just gonna run to the beach and then run back again.
[104:32.44]Yeah.
[104:35.09]Yeah, you're right.
[104:42.23]No, go back.
[104:45.18]New game.
[104:49.88]How do I exit?
[104:52.08]End game.
[104:52.46]There we go.
[104:54.66]That's how you do it.
[104:58.74]So that was Paws and Claws Pampered Pets.
[105:03.47]This next one is also by Paws and Claws and this one is called Pet School.
[105:10.45]Let's see how this one is.
[105:23.16]If I get a virus on stream, then whatever.
[105:26.30]THQ actually had something to do with this one.
[105:30.64]Old defunct THQ.
[105:36.91]And we've got a pause and clause nebula assertion.
[105:43.93]Runtime error nebula insertion.
[105:46.07]Petschool.exe has stopped working.
[105:47.97]Well, that's unfortunate.
[105:52.83]Let's try it again.
[105:57.53]What is a nebula assertion?
[106:00.29]Anybody in here know computers?
[106:04.92]I got it to run.
[106:05.44]It's working.
[106:07.42]But you guys can't see this, huh?
[106:10.66]Hmm.
[106:10.84]I think it was because I had to alt tab.
[106:17.46]Hmm.
[106:20.55]Hey, there we go.
[106:22.64]Paws and Claws Pet School.
[106:26.10]New game.
[106:31.74]What is the point of ever customizing?
[106:33.44]What's with these games and having a custom avatar?
[106:37.26]With like 15 shirts.
[106:40.24]They're all the same.
[106:41.10]They're all so boring.
[106:41.96]It doesn't even matter.
[106:42.68]There's no reason to ever do any of these things.
[106:48.65]Just have a default character.
[106:53.11]Select the pet you want to start the game with.
[106:55.09]Small animal, young animal, dog or a cat.
[106:57.97]Which one?
[107:08.00]Dog.
[107:08.78]We haven't seen a dog all stream.
[107:13.92]We have not interacted with a real dog here.
[107:19.77]I feel like this is important.
[107:20.61]We're going to do a poll.
[107:24.63]This is the most important decision all night.
[107:27.43]So, here's straw poll.
[107:35.93]Which animal are we going to do here?
[107:39.10]Small.
[107:42.26]Dog.
[107:44.56]Cat.
[107:46.02]Or young.
[107:46.74]Here you go.
[107:54.11]Please vote on that poll if you would.
[107:58.23]Appreciate it.
[108:03.50]Now don't vote for fucking rodents.
[108:05.86]Oh my god.
[108:08.62]This whole stream has been rodents and tortoises, gerbils, gophers.
[108:13.97]And that's what's going to win.
[108:22.59]It's already winning by more than 100 votes.
[108:24.01]Do you guys really want to see more of the same rodents?
[108:29.97]There's only like two rodents.
[108:33.41]It's the same two companies.
[108:34.87]They probably shared assets with each other.
[108:36.88]And you guys want to see the same thing you've already seen again?
[108:39.08]Alright.
[108:49.51]The poll is closing in 10 seconds.
[108:57.28]cat's face.
[109:02.49]Alright, that's it.
[109:03.31]We're doing small.
[109:11.29]Yeah, this cat really does have, like, a crack face.
[109:16.14]This is one of those... If you could zoom in a little bit.
[109:19.10]I'll do it.
[109:20.16]I'll do it for you guys.
[109:21.40]Don't worry.
[109:22.20]I'll take care of it.
[109:25.17]We're going to make a meme on stream.
[109:28.37]How's that sound?
[109:31.08]I'll do it for you.
[109:33.14]I lost the feed.
[109:35.50]God damn it.
[109:35.96]Come on.
[109:36.56]This is going to be funny.
[109:37.88]Come on.
[109:39.26]Get back here.
[109:45.17]I can clearly see the damn thing.
[109:52.09]Come on, man.
[109:53.33]What the fuck?
[109:54.41]This is so irritating.
[109:58.53]Pull it in.
[109:59.55]Pet school.
[110:04.29]There it is.
[110:04.81]Okay.
[110:05.88]Oh, you stupid asshole.
[110:07.32]Why are you doing this?
[110:10.14]Oh my god.
[110:10.78]It shrunk resolutions too.
[110:14.16]Oh, this is such potential.
[110:15.48]I'm just going to take a fucking screenshot.
[110:17.78]We have to make a couple of memes here.
[110:23.30]You'll see exactly what I'm talking about.
[110:25.16]Just give me a minute.
[110:29.78]You guys are going to know exactly what I'm talking about.
[110:36.22]Yeah.
[110:37.35]Yeah, see?
[110:38.01]You will.
[110:38.31]Okay, save as PNG.
[110:50.01]Okay, I think my disk tray just opened.
[110:52.27]No, it didn't.
[110:52.71]Okay, good.
[110:57.97]So here, you ready for this?
[111:00.09]Let's get it nice and big.
[111:18.65]Let's do some cropping action here.
[111:27.68]Just wait.
[111:28.02]We're going to do it for the dog too, don't worry.
[111:43.06]Like here, that looks alright.
[111:44.96]You guys are going to know exactly what I'm talking about.
[111:59.41]Alright, here we go.
[111:59.85]Let's make a meme.
[112:00.39]Here we go.
[112:00.97]Let's do it.
[112:01.57]So it's going to be like a that face when, right?
[112:10.62]So it's that face when.
[112:11.94]I'm going to put that there.
[112:25.36]Uh, that face when... Oh no, that face when... Uh, pop quiz.
[112:42.09]See?
[112:44.06]Like, you got a pop quiz in math.
[112:46.10]And you didn't fucking study.
[112:47.26]Not we're gonna... Let's make it a little better.
[112:48.66]Hold on.
[112:49.68]Wait.
[112:53.66]Hold on.
[112:55.28]We'll change that.
[112:57.63]That feeling when it hits.
[113:00.23]Yeah, that feeling when the catnip hits.
[113:17.99]So that face when too much catnip.
[113:20.85]That's a pretty good one.
[113:25.49]Now let's go a little bit more meta here.
[113:27.73]How about this one?
[113:31.19]Let's do that.
[113:46.04]OK.
[113:47.90]As you can see, I'm pretty well versed.
[113:57.31]No, I'm not sure if catnip.
[114:15.81]Fuck.
[114:16.55]It's not right.
[114:17.22]Okay, now I'm going to move on to the dog.
[114:26.54]The dog one will be easier because this one is instead of didn't study for the... Hold on.
[114:32.15]I'm giving it away.
[114:33.07]I'm giving away the meme.
[114:34.25]I didn't want to do that.
[114:34.93]Okay.
[114:47.52]Okay.
[115:00.56]They are.
[115:03.50]Like that.
[115:04.73]Didn't study.
[115:06.57]Got an A anyway.
[115:15.71]I can do you one more.
[115:17.33]I can do you one more.
[115:19.33]Didn't think I was going to have one ready for the fucking two animals, did you?
[115:22.17]Hmm.
[115:41.10]Didn't think I was gonna have two more!
[115:44.55]How's that for a meme?
[115:45.41]Mm-hmm.
[115:51.27]I got one more for you.
[115:56.97]What about that?
[115:58.43]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[115:59.37]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[116:00.55]Look at the cat's face.
[116:02.41]So the cat just obviously does not want to be with the dog.
[116:09.40]No, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[116:12.93]Uh, like my, like, my boyfriend, no, girlfriend.
[116:17.33]Girlfriend, uh, my girlfriend sucks.
[116:20.33]My boyfriend sucks.
[116:24.47]Uh, something like that.
[116:30.71]Hold on, I'll get it.
[116:31.49]Um.
[116:36.50]No, no, no, not doctor.
[116:38.32]Not doctor, doc.
[116:46.28]I can't think of one.
[116:56.20]You got three quality memes from me.
[116:57.86]You're not gonna get a fourth one.
[117:09.77]How do I get this off the screen?
[117:14.51]Asshole doctor.
[117:28.53]Do a fourth one or I'm going to leave.
[117:30.29]Come on.
[117:31.07]Wait a minute.
[117:32.23]I got it.
[117:32.73]I'll get it.
[117:33.49]Just give me a minute.
[117:36.36]Oh, hold on.
[117:37.40]It's got to be about how like this one, the person on the left obviously does not is like at a party and the drugs hit too fast.
[117:46.79]You drank too much weed.
[117:48.35]You smoke too much weed.
[117:49.53]And like the person next to you is, you know, here we go.
[118:03.51]So that reaction when... There we go.
[118:17.30]That one, that's pretty good.
[118:24.59]So this is that reaction when you just shit your pants at your wedding.
[118:27.45]Because this is the bride and the groom.
[118:33.75]Get it off the fucking screen.
[118:34.61]I don't even want to see it.
[118:44.76]And I lost the capture now.
[118:54.71]I can't pull it back.
[118:55.69]I can't get the game to capture again.
[118:59.95]Not bad for a normie.
[119:05.43]talking about and will the game please capture I will do whatever I'll do anything to get this to capture it just won't and guys could you guess you don't even need to see this shit because it's not even it's nothing the game is a fucking piece of crap
[119:34.43]Don't worry.
[119:35.25]You're not missing much.
[119:39.82]I would love to get this on the screen.
[119:43.62]Setup.
[119:46.54]There's only two resolutions.
[119:50.40]Oh my god.
[119:51.44]What the fuck are you doing?
[119:52.78]Alright.
[119:58.26]We gotta go to another game because we can't even choose the pet because the game will not capture anymore.
[120:04.32]That's where we are.
[120:05.64]That's how we've gotten here.
[120:13.76]Last try.
[120:18.38]Got it.
[120:19.86]I'm not going to change that.
[120:21.46]I can't alt tab.
[120:23.16]If I alt tab, the whole thing is going down.
[120:26.14]I don't care what I look like.
[120:29.00]Small animals.
[120:29.58]You're going to have to deal with that.
[120:33.27]Because if I alt-tab, it's gonna disappear.
[120:37.59]And look, it's the same game we already played.
[120:39.25]We welcome you to our pet school.
[120:41.79]This course will introduce you to the pet school management.
[120:46.13]God.
[120:50.46]Why is there a Minecraft chest?
[120:53.54]That is yawned.
[120:54.40]That's how you can tell that I gotta get out of this one.
[120:57.92]Warehouse.
[120:58.46]That warehouse looks oddly like a mini-fridge.
[121:08.97]No, I got nothing here.
[121:10.93]I know how to use the fucking mouse.
[121:12.77]It's the same narrator?
[121:13.83]No, I don't think it is.
[121:14.45]I think it's a different narrator.
[121:16.35]Alright, well, small animals were sure were cool, weren't they?
[121:25.90]Okay, just as long as you guys have realized, this is the small animal's hideout.
[121:30.56]This is where they're gonna have all their fun.
[121:33.72]See?
[121:36.30]They sleep on hay.
[121:43.28]Alright.
[121:46.70]That's that one.
[121:49.52]We are getting to the point where we only have another few left to go.
[121:57.97]Should I just throw in the towel and open this?
[121:59.43]Yeah, I am.
[122:00.17]I'm throwing in the towel.
[122:10.81]I don't know what this is going to say.
[122:14.20]but let's just make sure I can get it captured because there's a lot of dialog apparently here.
[122:23.38]Just another day in Paradise.
[122:25.74]Welcome to your beautiful beach vacation.
[122:28.37]Everything is perfect on this island.
[122:30.05]The weather, the atmosphere, and the people here are friendly too.
[122:33.13]Whether you're relaxing, dancing at the club, or just hanging out, you will find exactly what you're looking for.
[122:41.08]Sometimes even everlasting love.
[122:48.74]This is part of the bundle.
[122:49.90]This is My Boyfriend 2.
[122:54.98]Nice resolution.
[122:58.94]This is the sound it makes when you get a slot machine bonus.
[123:02.66]Like, oh, there's one, there's two, I got the bonus!
[123:06.07]And then it goes ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[123:10.87]Why is the music at zero?
[123:18.56]Well, now I know why it's at zero to start.
[123:26.15]We'll do 4%.
[123:30.35]This is also when you win like 200 cents at a slot machine.
[123:37.12]This whole thing is...
[123:42.96]Alright, so let's go for a scenario here.
[123:46.48]We're going to win some money at a slot machine.
[123:48.56]So remember, you pull the machine down.
[123:50.20]I won fucking 15 bucks.
[123:57.90]Excellent.
[123:58.24]Let's do it again.
[123:58.68]20 bucks.
[124:04.72]And then I say... Ah, sehr gut.
[124:06.61]Dankeschön.
[124:07.35]Dankeschön.
[124:08.25]Sorry.
[124:21.22]Look, just do me a favor.
[124:23.96]Just like, bear with me here.
[124:25.22]This, there's not a whole lot to go.
[124:27.56]Of course, like this, I'm reaching for material with this one.
[124:35.51]Left click and hold the 1.
[124:36.61]This is just The Sims.
[124:37.39]This is the exact copy of The Sims 4.
[124:40.13]Sims 3.
[124:40.41]I'm not even trying to hide it.
[124:43.50]The same dresser is in the background.
[124:47.03]In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this was the same fucking paint and you guys can't even see it.
[124:52.86]You guys can't see it.
[124:54.38]So, never mind.
[124:57.52]Never mind, because we're not seeing the same thing again.
[125:15.37]So, um...
[125:18.22]You mean to tell me that you're not seeing this?
[125:26.15]Interesting.
[125:27.69]Well, that's what I'm seeing.
[125:30.61]You didn't get to even see my funny jokes.
[125:35.67]There's the dresser I was talking about.
[125:37.87]I remember I said I wouldn't be surprised if that's the same painting that's in The Sims 3, The Sims 4.
[125:47.45]Okay, so back to it.
[125:50.00]Let's just pull this back.
[125:52.48]Put the game capture back where it belongs, and good luck.
[125:58.58]Because I don't know what else you guys are going to see.
[126:02.70]Could be anything at this point.
[126:06.56]I'm going to make a random name.
[126:11.84]Oh god, now she's wearing no clothes.
[126:16.05]She actually is not wearing any clothes.
[126:20.47]I wish you guys could see this.
[126:21.61]This is a Mickey Mouse shirt, but it's not even Mickey Mouse.
[126:27.07]I don't even care.
[126:30.92]What you got?
[126:31.36]You know, it don't even matter.
[126:39.16]You guys can't see it.
[126:39.92]I'll just make him fucking naked.
[126:42.30]Doesn't even matter.
[126:55.01]Underwear and sneakers.
[127:04.64]I... I don't think you guys can see this either.
[127:13.67]Yeah.
[127:20.43]Hey, did you unpack your bikini yet?
[127:21.77]We're inside of my bedroom.
[127:22.77]Did you put it in your closet?
[127:24.49]Come on, what are you waiting for?
[127:26.51]Put it on and let's hit the surf.
[127:28.25]It's in my closet.
[127:29.47]Just give me a minute and I'll get it.
[127:30.91]You guys are currently inside of the wall.
[127:41.05]You guys get to be the camera?
[127:45.56]I think there's another house down there.
[127:49.77]What house is down there?
[127:52.05]There are three houses.
[127:53.21]There's an entire neighborhood down there.
[127:54.99]I don't see that shit.
[128:05.64]This is... There!
[128:06.44]See?
[128:06.52]This is what I see.
[128:15.32]I'm going to the shower.
[128:19.99]Is this forever?
[128:20.93]I think it might be.
[128:22.97]There's no... No, that's not a wreck, is it?
[128:28.97]It is.
[128:30.27]I think it is.
[128:33.60]Oh, no.
[128:34.04]Damn it.
[128:34.34]I thought that was me all the way down there.
[128:36.44]It actually might be me all the way down there.
[128:37.98]It is, isn't it?
[128:39.92]Yeah, it is.
[128:42.54]Somebody zoom in and enhance.
[128:46.34]I need to know.
[128:48.39]This is way more important than this stupid fucking game.
[128:53.32]Somebody take a picture right there.
[128:55.22]Screenshot that.
[128:59.38]I can't do it.
[129:05.93]And zoom in all the way.
[129:16.30]How do I just go?
[129:20.62]There's so much this game could be as well, and we don't even get to see it because you guys are like, can't even see.
[129:28.10]Can I put it in a window?
[129:29.38]What if I change the resolution?
[129:33.93]No.
[129:38.11]I don't know what I did.
[129:39.35]I just made it way worse.
[129:40.45]The quality is so bad now.
[129:43.31]What the fuck did I do?
[129:49.82]I just made it way more pixelated and awful looking.
[130:04.97]Just do monitor capture.
[130:06.19]Alright, we're going to pull out.
[130:13.31]My computer crashed.
[130:16.93]Let's try it.
[130:20.05]Can I just sort of get a window capture?
[130:23.38]It's possible.
[130:25.00]There we go.
[130:27.30]Look at that.
[130:27.68]Alright, say goodbye to this one.
[130:31.60]You guys, we can actually play the game now.
[130:39.93]Oh, dickhead.
[130:41.09]No, I just lost it.
[130:43.26]Why must you do that?
[130:45.22]Oh my god, you fucking god.
[130:53.67]Got it.
[130:56.01]So, this is what I've been seeing the whole time.
[130:58.79]Nothing more, nothing less.
[131:01.37]Let's talk to this person.
[131:03.14]I don't know how we're supposed to talk to them.
[131:07.61]Logbook.
[131:09.00]We're here.
[131:11.14]Inventory.
[131:11.68]I got a towel.
[131:12.34]I don't know what that does.
[131:19.54]Just like graph.
[131:22.21]Look at this.
[131:22.65]Sprint button.
[131:26.19]How do I leave?
[131:26.93]What did she say?
[131:27.51]How do I leave the hotel room?
[131:32.72]Well, isn't that just a fucking awful place for that?
[131:38.63]Wear a swimsuit.
[131:42.41]Get me out of here.
[131:43.73]What's the button to leave the house?
[131:46.17]Oh, I have to... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[131:54.80]See, this is what I was talking about.
[131:56.04]Look at that Mickey Mouse clone right here.
[132:01.24]Chat's not ready to handle the bikini.
[132:03.08]Oh, here it is.
[132:04.60]Swimwear.
[132:05.12]Now let's go to the beach.
[132:13.51]Here we go.
[132:14.03]Now I gotta meet up with some dudes.
[132:16.01]Yes.
[132:16.39]I'd like to know where you found the most generic tattoos you could ever have.
[132:20.75]He just has like a barbed wire on his arm.
[132:22.65]Alright.
[132:22.95]Whatever.
[132:23.16]Right now I just want to spend time cruising around.
[132:39.17]Whatever.
[132:40.09]Right now, I just want to spend some time cruising around.
[132:42.73]That's not the tone that I wanted to use.
[132:43.67]Maybe I'll have some questions for you later.
[132:45.23]No problem.
[132:46.21]Just come to the surf school here on the beach if you want to ask me any questions.
[132:49.91]I'm usually here.
[132:50.96]Will do.
[132:51.96]Thanks.
[132:55.00]That's my first... This is the first guy that I'm going to date.
[132:57.72]Is there a jump?
[133:00.80]It's a big place.
[133:06.65]That's sociability, beauty care, fitness.
[133:08.67]Let's get all the way down to fitness.
[133:11.70]Now we're in the swimming pool.
[133:12.82]Now we're up.
[133:13.84]And let's go ahead and order a drink.
[133:20.30]How can I help you?
[133:21.58]I would like a beer.
[133:23.08]I would like something to drink.
[133:24.60]What can I get you?
[133:25.32]A glass of cola.
[133:28.60]A glass of milk.
[133:30.70]Or a glass of water.
[133:33.04]If you walk up to a bar...
[133:35.47]And you order a glass of milk.
[133:39.23]There are dead people that are buried inside of your house.
[133:44.03]It just is.
[133:46.72]You have people down in your basement and there ain't coming out.
[133:51.86]Fucking love milk, by the way.
[134:11.93]Wait, does that mean... You don't go to a bar and order a milk?
[134:21.12]They don't serve milk at a bar, guys.
[134:25.48]They serve shitty blue Bud Light bottles.
[134:31.57]And expensive Jack and Cokes that are $18.
[134:40.24]Is it weird for me to say that I really love this water?
[134:48.73]White Russian?
[134:49.49]They use powder.
[134:50.69]It's a powdered mix.
[134:53.51]Not a real drink.
[134:56.53]They take water, they go behind the counter, and they dump the Russian... The... White Russian mix into the water and spin it around.
[135:05.16]Let me give it to you.
[135:09.22]So, um, I think I'm done with this one.
[135:16.09]But we kind of need to get, like, we need to get, like, a kiss.
[135:18.31]Isn't that how it works?
[135:20.37]I can't go in there.
[135:25.05]Fitness room.
[135:30.70]Let's lift some weights, maybe, on the treadmill.
[135:38.87]I can't go on any of these.
[135:43.40]Where's the random good-looking yoga instructor, right?
[135:46.96]You know he's gonna be in the game.
[135:53.30]They've nailed pets down, as you can see.
[135:56.81]That's pretty much the only game they make, so of course they have a handful of assets lying around.
[136:01.49]Go to the beach.
[136:10.39]Down here.
[136:18.84]Okay.
[136:26.26]Beach!
[136:30.15]Kiss the dog.
[136:31.07]I made a second character.
[136:39.62]Where is he?
[136:42.06]I actually made the love interest.
[136:48.61]Can I be down here?
[136:49.31]Can I swim to the island?
[136:53.03]These are all questions I'm asking out loud.
[136:54.71]Alright, Steven.
[137:04.34]I'm not a waitress.
[137:07.25]You know, it'd be great if you could just get me a drink.
[137:09.29]I'll tip you.
[137:09.95]Fuck yourself, dude.
[137:17.80]I'm gonna get eaten by a shark.
[137:36.84]What is over here?
[137:41.96]There's something here.
[137:42.74]It's a backpack.
[137:46.98]There's a duckbill.
[137:48.32]There's a giant fortune cookie.
[137:52.84]Is she your BFF?
[137:54.52]Interested in if your best friend is really a friend or just out for herself?
[137:59.77]When you go shopping together, what does she do?
[138:04.05]She lets me try on ridiculous clothes and then she laughs about me.
[138:10.77]We've strived for excellence here, going right into paranoia in our own head.
[138:16.90]She calls you on the phone.
[138:17.88]What do you talk about?
[138:21.66]She asked me about my problems.
[138:22.70]She talks about herself and her many admirers.
[138:27.99]Why is there a telephone in the fortune cookie?
[138:34.86]We're doing a personality test for another character, not me.
[138:46.67]We done?
[138:50.41]Why are we doing this?
[138:51.87]You hold a party.
[138:52.71]What does she wear?
[138:53.47]She'll probably have the same dress as me.
[138:57.63]She loves it when we look identical.
[139:00.64]Something stunning.
[139:07.15]Oh my god.
[139:08.00]You have to leave her alone with your new boyfriend.
[139:10.16]How do you feel?
[139:12.58]I'm afraid that she will snatch him from me.
[139:14.44]She's done it before.
[139:19.60]Do you want the sword, the staff, or the shield?
[139:28.69]Total rivals.
[139:29.77]With friends like that, who needs enemies?
[139:31.47]A friend is not someone who is only interested...
[139:38.63]I've done it before.
[139:39.47]Alright, what about the bonfire?
[139:49.69]No.
[139:51.07]There's no health in this game.
[139:52.31]I can't just burn myself to death.
[139:56.48]As much as I would love to do that right now.
[140:03.60]No.
[140:04.66]They knew people were going to do that.
[140:18.32]You're a violent person.
[140:19.74]What?
[140:20.82]I'm not a violent person.
[140:22.99]I'm a violent video game person.
[140:25.63]What's the difference?
[140:30.45]There we go.
[140:32.55]There are the Jacuzzis.
[140:33.79]That's a two-person Jacuzzi.
[140:38.58]Another two-person Jacuzzi.
[140:42.73]Here are the men.
[140:44.43]Here are... There he is!
[140:45.79]This is my guy!
[140:46.39]This is my guy.
[140:47.95]Alright.
[140:48.55]Billy.
[140:50.73]I wish I had some free time.
[140:52.77]So I could go swimming.
[140:53.89]I made this person.
[141:00.75]What do you mean you wish I had some free time?
[141:06.73]That shirt says, learn to play.
[141:11.23]Yay, okay.
[141:12.07]How do I get him like to get awesome off time?
[141:16.19]What was the point of me making an NPC if I can't do anything about it?
[141:19.27]I have to work out to look good.
[141:21.05]Have you gone to the gym today?
[141:22.13]What are you trying to say?
[141:30.76]Why are these guys all being downvoted?
[141:40.02]I have yet to beat Ringo at step aerobics.
[141:43.44]I need to practice.
[141:44.30]I have yet to beat Ringo at step aerobics.
[141:51.49]I need to practice.
[141:52.37]Can he come with me in the boat?
[141:58.83]Well, he said he would go with me.
[142:04.48]Gnarly waves out there.
[142:06.06]I just love surfing.
[142:10.73]I'm about to give up.
[142:15.83]Yeah.
[142:22.26]Getting close to the give up stage.
[142:29.38]Casper the friendly ghost.
[142:34.55]What can I get you?
[142:36.52]I would like something to drink.

[143:35.57]Okay, but please do come back if you need anything.
[143:37.93]Ay, ay, ay.
[143:38.55]Hey, check out those beets.
[143:40.79]Check out those beets?
[143:42.73]What beets?
[143:45.51]Oh.
[143:46.61]Oh, these beets.
[143:53.03]These beets.
[144:00.49]I wouldn't call this a beet.
[144:10.20]Check out those beats.
[144:11.20]Alright, let's go work out.
[144:16.72]I'm just gonna listen to the music.
[144:27.99]Wait, ice cream.
[144:44.68]I'd like an ice cream.
[144:47.10]Three scoops.
[144:48.26]I'd like an ice cream with three scoops and a cone.
[144:51.02]What kind would you like?
[144:53.00]I would like lemon ice cream because I'm a fucking weirdo.

[145:28.89]Speaking of porn music... What else can we buy?
[145:37.99]Those are huge!
[145:40.17]Look at the size of those things!
[145:43.39]These are like size 18!
[145:46.72]These are clown shoes.
[145:51.22]No, these definitely aren't shoes.
[145:53.13]These are the Mall Kiosk Sneaker Slippers.
[145:56.37]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[145:59.09]The big, oversized, plushy sneakers?
[146:04.13]Sure, I'll take a pair.
[146:18.65]I like a pair of clown shoes.
[146:19.86]There's a club.
[146:21.06]We have to keep playing.
[146:22.04]I'm sorry, guys.
[146:23.06]We have to keep playing.
[146:23.74]That's barely even underwear.
[146:42.82]Is that a stethoscope?
[146:43.74]No.
[146:44.88]Okay.
[146:45.50]Definitely not this.
[146:46.26]We need something hot to wear to the club.
[146:52.21]That's sporty.
[146:54.61]Okay, that's casual.
[146:56.23]Okay.
[147:03.31]Now we want a little top.
[147:15.89]Alright, somebody from the last game made this outfit.
[147:20.29]That, like, runway game.
[147:21.61]Somebody made this.
[147:26.89]Gotta have Mickey Mouse.
[147:27.61]Mm-hmm.
[147:29.78]And shoes.
[147:30.28]Gonna go with... What the hell are these?
[147:36.74]The giant sneakers.
[147:37.48]No, we gotta get, like... Yeah, these are the... Right here.
[147:44.32]Now can I impress anybody?
[147:47.27]What the fuck?
[147:47.85]Alright, that's it for this game.
[147:51.99]So... There are no animals in this one.
[148:01.20]Sorry, guys.
[148:09.04]This is supposed to be only an animal stream.
[148:11.74]No, I'm not going to the club.
[148:12.96]It's not happening.
[148:17.49]We only have, like, a couple left.
[148:21.05]We have... Oh, man.
[148:27.11]Here's another one.
[148:27.73]You're not going to want to watch this one.
[148:34.06]This one is so fucking stupid.
[148:37.74]This is just the vet game three more times.
[148:40.16]This is my vet practice marine patrol.
[148:44.20]Alright.
[148:44.50]I'll open it.
[148:45.44]Alright.
[148:50.78]I'll at least open it.
[148:56.24]You're not going to get much else from me, though.
[149:09.57]That's fine.
[149:20.24]This release might be fun.
[149:21.28]Start game.
[149:22.10]Empty.
[149:22.44]Wait, come back.
[149:23.10]It's loud.
[149:23.42]It's way too loud.
[149:23.86]These are your only options.
[149:24.72]That's nice.
[149:25.26]Go with this doctor.
[149:26.92]Enter your name.
[149:51.71]Matt with three T's I'm different I'm ready I understand
[150:22.42]This one's third person, so... Hey, look, it's the intro to Diablo 3.
[150:45.00]How is Diablo 3 doing?
[150:46.00]No, what?
[150:49.56]The ranger from, um...
[150:53.01]Yogi Bear is here.
[150:56.77]Almost ran over this animal.
[150:57.91]The poor thing was just lying there helpless.
[150:59.43]Could you take a look at it?
[151:00.29]Of course, I'll have to examine it in the surgery.
[151:04.51]Hope you can save it.
[151:05.25]Every animal deserves a chance.
[151:09.01]It's a seagull.
[151:12.55]Alright, let's open him up.
[151:19.76]Let's see what we're working with here.
[151:21.38]Take out his guts.
[151:22.28]Use the stethoscope.
[151:23.84]How do I do this?
[151:26.40]Too far.
[151:26.74]Do they put it on his heart?
[151:49.74]Super!
[151:53.75]I need to hold it down, don't I?
[151:59.57]Hold down your left mouse button.
[152:00.77]Try to guess where the heart is.
[152:02.65]I don't need to guess where the heart is.
[152:05.20]The heart is like right here.
[152:06.42]I got five stars.
[152:17.53]Okay, there are no life-threatening wounds, just small ones.
[152:19.74]First, clean and disinfect the wounds.
[152:20.98]Inject an antibiotic.
[152:24.66]It's perfect.
[152:27.82]Oh, boy!
[152:28.68]The seagull seems to have gold embedded in its wings.
[152:37.24]Oh, I've like... I've... I've like clocked out here, guys.
[152:48.38]I'm roughing marshmallows all over these.
[152:51.34]These are actually wounds.
[152:53.30]Gross.
[152:54.28]What was that surgery game for the Wii?
[153:03.82]Total Action Drama Island.
[153:05.48]What was it called?
[153:06.04]Total Sur... What was the name of the surgery game for the Wii?
[153:09.18]Where bugs were inside of people.
[153:11.08]And you had to zap them with laser beams.
[153:14.20]Crisis Center.
[153:14.86]What was it?
[153:15.34]Crisis... What was it called?
[153:16.94]Trauma Center.
[153:26.12]Oh, that's what- you can just hold it.
[153:31.43]Yeah, total- total trauma island.
[153:39.91]Didn't this kid go to college?
[153:41.31]Yeah, I- like, I know.
[153:42.75]He doesn't need, like, some doctor to tell him how to put disinfectant in a wound.
[153:53.40]Alright, I'm kind of clocking out, so I'm reading this weirdly.
[153:57.12]The animal requires an injection.
[153:59.32]We have a supply of three very powerful medicines.
[154:02.32]One is full of vitamins, while the other will KILL the animal.
[154:06.25]Like, I don't know why, like, I'm just sitting there like, wait, what?
[154:08.47]Alright, we can effectively treat almost any disease.
[154:18.61]The symbol on the animal's skin represents the medicine's color.
[154:21.45]Easy.
[154:24.85]Got it.
[154:25.71]So he needs one star and two pink moons.
[154:36.65]Place it on the spot, mouse button, and then use the injection.
[154:40.81]Okay.
[154:49.82]Can you tell I was trying to inject it into his eye?
[154:52.38]You can't.
[155:01.57]Ointments help the animal's skin.
[155:05.78]Tap the ointment.
[155:07.42]Cover the skin.
[155:08.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[155:09.02]This is Jalenus in school.
[155:10.22]No, I don't remember this.
[155:11.22]I'm fucking useless.
[155:18.23]Use the spatula?
[155:22.75]They don't slap a spatula on somebody's body.
[155:34.84]At least this actually has a video game here.
[155:36.46]I don't get... Why am I taking it off?
[155:47.35]I guess I did good.
[155:49.13]That's not a spatula.
[156:07.88]Alright, say goodbye to the animal.
[156:09.03]Alright, let's get a real animal now.
[156:15.81]No more seagulls.
[156:17.17]Give us a fox.
[156:21.88]Stranded animal on the beach.
[156:23.08]Could you examine it?
[156:23.94]It did not resist capture.
[156:25.20]Alright, let's go.
[156:28.18]Into surgery.
[156:30.74]It's not a fucking seagull.
[156:37.69]This place is just littered with fucking birds.
[156:52.04]Vets don't treat to seagulls, okay?
[156:55.70]I got news for you.
[156:57.94]If a seagull is injured on the beach, that motherfucker dies.
[157:03.00]Nobody saves that seagull.
[157:07.26]That's just the way it is.
[157:08.04]It's terrible, but it's horrible to know that.
[157:11.00]You know how many seagulls die a day?
[157:14.39]Like 500,000.
[157:15.79]They'll be endangered in no time.
[157:30.64]You see, look.
[157:31.66]They only brought it in here because that's 250 pound weights.
[157:34.36]We're gonna crush the seagull.
[157:45.00]They seem to be eating well.
[157:45.88]Yeah, they do.
[157:50.77]Six gallons of seagulls a year.
[157:52.47]Alright, if there's another seagull, look, I love seagulls.
[157:58.83]Seagulls are a very sweet animal.
[158:00.85]It's really funny when they eat french fries on the beach that people throw at them.
[158:05.11]They really are funny when they eat, like, bread that, like, random fucking drunk patrons throw in the air.
[158:11.29]They're like, oh, the seagulls will get it.
[158:14.14]They're cute, and they're funny, and I think they're really cool.
[158:16.09]They have a nice sound.
[158:18.93]But we're clogging up the... There are tigers that need to be seen.
[158:24.03]There are elephants that need medical attention right now.
[158:31.31]Got another seagull.
[158:40.99]Alright, what do I have to do?
[158:43.33]I have to... Am I guessing the seagull's weight?
[158:47.77]Are we at the county fair?
[158:49.77]Is he gonna get tickets?
[158:52.63]This seagull is not 625 pounds.
[158:54.15]Oh, okay.
[158:54.55]The goddamn music.
[159:12.59]Alright, what's wrong with the seagull?
[159:13.88]Let's give him some vitamins.
[159:16.56]That's this one.
[159:17.60]Okay.
[159:18.98]Like an expert.
[159:40.09]Yeah, I can't turn off the music.
[159:45.97]Sorry guys, the seagull doctor can't turn off the music.
[159:55.30]I can't, there's no menu.
[159:57.20]I can't turn off the music.
[159:59.62]Found a stranded animal.
[160:00.64]I believe you're the right person to come to.
[160:01.86]Can you take a look at it?
[160:04.22]Well, that depends.
[160:05.40]A ranger?
[160:08.04]Is it a fucking seagull?
[160:29.28]What a boring fucking town If you're treating seagulls only you live in a real fucking boring place Seagull pet
[161:01.36]No, no, this seagull's allergic to something.
[161:05.57]I'm not sure.
[161:06.29]Let's figure it out.
[161:07.03]Let's spend like a thousand dollars in taxpayer money to diagnose what the seagull is allergic to.
[161:16.28]Okay.
[161:17.80]That sounds great.
[161:19.22]Great use of our state taxes.
[161:21.04]Let's find out.
[161:32.23]I think he might be allergic to French fries.
[161:38.47]What am I running out?
[161:39.23]Spread it around.
[161:42.28]Good.
[162:02.56]Yeah, seagulls, like Sam, you're right.
[162:05.45]Seagulls don't know what an allergy is.
[162:08.47]So what's the point of diagnosing an allergy if they're allergic to fucking soiled diapers?
[162:15.33]They're gonna keep eating them.
[162:16.25]They don't get it.
[162:16.79]They don't understand what they're doing.
[162:23.10]If a seagull's gonna eat shit, it's gonna eat shit.
[162:25.28]It doesn't know if it's allergic to it.
[162:26.44]It doesn't understand the concept of an allergy.
[162:30.24]Oh, hold on, guys.
[162:31.84]I'd love to walk for... We've got another call here.
[162:36.62]What can I help you with, Ranger?
[162:38.48]Oh, well, good day.
[162:39.22]While patrolling the outer perimeter, I found this animal in distress.
[162:43.25]Could you please take a look at it, vet?
[162:45.99]Of course.
[162:47.27]Leave the animal in the surgery tank.
[162:48.89]I'll take a look right away.
[162:51.54]Sure, and please keep me updated on its status.
[162:54.56]I'm just so into fucking seagulls.
[162:57.82]I just need to make sure that they're all okay.
[163:16.79]You know, part of me blames the ranger for this.
[163:24.55]It's the same one.
[163:26.83]There are only, like, only seagulls in the world.
[163:30.85]I can't even do it.
[163:32.17]I can't even do it.
[163:32.98]There's no words.
[163:35.62]This one's supposed to be fat?
[163:36.60]Okay.
[163:54.66]Here you go, take some vitamins!
[164:00.42]Two pound bird, and he's underweight.
[164:05.71]They're often affected by storms.
[164:08.33]Unable to catch fish in the Tempest.
[164:11.87]They lose weight and finally strand.
[164:14.45]You did an awesome job with this patient.
[164:17.81]This guy's heavier than all the other seagulls.
[164:19.91]So this one's underweight and malnourished?
[164:24.04]Good news, this animal's not strong enough to be released.
[164:25.92]Say goodbye!
[164:30.65]Pretty experienced.
[164:33.71]Okay.
[164:36.43]Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
[164:38.61]If... If this... If this is the seagull again...
[164:48.15]I don't think it's going to happen.
[164:49.19]I really don't.
[164:50.05]I don't think we're going to get five seagulls in a row.
[164:52.57]That seems absolutely, totally ludicrous.
[164:55.89]So, if we get five seagulls in a row, I will donate $100 to charity.
[165:02.24]I really don't think it's going to happen.
[165:03.96]I don't think it's going to be five seagulls.
[165:07.14]We're going to get a new animal that's going to get introduced.
[165:14.71]Animal in distress.
[165:21.89]It's not gonna be a seagull.
[165:25.71]Keep me updated.
[165:26.39]Okay.
[165:55.05]My local food pantry just got $100.
[165:57.13]I'm gonna do it tomorrow.
[166:11.10]Donated to a seagull's foundation.
[166:16.58]Is there a seagull foundation?
[166:19.01]They might be.
[166:20.03]Somebody figure that out.
[166:26.89]Donated to the American Association of Seagull Relief.
[166:35.36]This seagull got hit by the propeller of a boat.
[166:39.44]I don't know how.
[166:47.31]There's a foundation to kill seagulls.
[166:49.13]It's me and my baseball bat.
[166:50.75]Oh my god, dude.
[166:52.26]Easy.
[166:55.88]Easy.
[166:56.32]Holy shit, dude.
[166:58.12]Wow.
[166:59.40]That was... Why did I... Of all the things in chat, that's the one that I happened to read?
[167:04.14]Jesus Christ.
[167:07.16]Oh, no.
[167:07.72]That's...
[167:16.08]Oh my god, that's so terrible.
[167:18.06]That's so terrible.
[167:21.12]Oh my god, that's terrible.
[167:22.86]I can't... I'm... This one's dirty.
[167:26.15]This one is.
[167:33.29]It's just a bunch of infected seagulls.
[167:38.80]Jesus Christ.
[167:40.80]That was like one of the most heinous things I've ever read.
[167:45.01]Teagulls are like fucking friendly.
[167:47.67]This isn't holding here.
[168:19.07]It better not be another seagull.
[168:27.47]I'm actually like crying right now.
[168:29.07]Am I even kidding?
[168:30.86]If it's another seagull, I don't know if I'm gonna make it.
[168:54.94]Some of the shit you guys are saying is fucking driving me crazy, man.
[169:01.15]Good news, Xeno's not strong enough to go.
[169:10.13]Okay.
[169:11.39]I still haven't been able to walk five feet forward.
[169:18.38]I almost ran this animal over.
[169:25.39]Thank you, hope you can save it.
[169:26.81]Every animal deserves a chance.
[169:29.11]Every seagull deserves a chance.
[169:49.32]Oh, this is like a penguin seagull.
[169:59.36]I was driving around in my car, and I almost ran over a seagull.
[170:06.27]Oh, I'm fine.
[170:09.71]Seagulls fucking fly, man.
[170:11.33]Like, you don't run over a seagull.
[170:15.01]Fuck, I don't know why this is doing this to me, but it is.
[170:18.62]This why of all things is why I think it's this funny.
[170:25.86]Ugh.
[170:26.12]Seagulls, yeah, seagulls of what are they?
[170:27.30]A flightless bird?
[170:33.66]What kind of car are you driving?
[170:36.48]You sure you're not driving around in a fucking airplane?
[170:39.86]No, no more seagulls.
[170:42.52]I don't want to see any other seagulls, please.
[170:45.58]No, you didn't...
[170:47.64]You didn't just run over with your car.
[170:49.96]There's no way.
[170:51.02]This one's 800 pounds.
[171:10.15]My god, please give me another animal that's not a seagull.
[171:21.76]She's attacking the seagulls.
[171:22.92]Yeah, that's the only explanation.
[171:27.29]She is grabbing seagulls and like wringing their necks and bringing them to me.
[171:33.65]I think this animal suffers from some allergic disease.
[171:38.29]Let's do some more diagnostics.
[171:40.43]Alright.
[171:44.14]Honest to God, somebody be real with me.
[171:46.44]This is seven or eight seagulls in a row.
[171:55.26]Is it seven?
[172:00.60]It's eight.
[172:02.15]I can't believe I've been playing this game for eight seagulls worth of time.
[172:05.67]That's a new denomination of time for me in this stream.
[172:09.65]Seven seagulls worth of time.
[172:12.29]My nose is like stuffed up from laughing at that.
[172:14.66]Alright, I'm gonna walk around for a second.
[172:33.62]No, no, don't even answer it.
[172:35.74]Don't answer it, because I know what it's gonna be.
[172:37.44]I'm gonna... It's gonna be another seagull.
[172:40.96]No, I can't even open doors.
[172:42.65]You can't enter this building at the moment.
[172:44.79]To access this building, you need to be... You need the required authorization.
[172:47.87]Once available, you can buy them.
[172:51.11]So, no, there's work to be done.
[172:52.27]Apparently, it's such an emergency that I can't go in any buildings.
[172:58.51]No.
[173:00.29]I don't want to answer this.
[173:02.98]You cannot enter this building at the moment.
[173:04.69]To access this building, you need the required authorization.
[173:15.05]Okay.
[173:16.51]I think we're good.
[173:17.75]No, we're not.
[173:26.14]I think you handled your first patient very well.
[173:43.54]I'm not gonna look.
[173:46.56]I'm not gonna look.
[173:50.08]I'm literally, my hands are covering my eyes.
[173:55.84]Is it gonna be eight seagulls in a row?
[173:57.56]I'm not looking yet.
[174:01.93]That's the music!
[174:04.41]It's a seagull!
[174:16.97]Get me away from this.
[174:19.75]I need to play this game until it's proven to me that there's another animal worth saving.
[174:23.39]The game... What do you mean that you don't think the game has other animals?
[174:31.36]And at the title screen, there were dolphins.
[174:36.72]There were seals.
[174:41.10]What happens if you just fail?
[174:42.64]I don't know.
[174:49.29]Give this one vitamins.
[174:50.55]Okay.
[174:55.90]Where's my PDA?
[174:58.82]Shop.
[174:59.42]I have 1280.
[175:17.36]No, guys.
[175:19.10]I can't do anything.
[175:23.42]There is no moving.
[175:25.14]There's nothing.
[175:26.64]There is only seagulls.
[175:32.96]Open the PDA, they say.
[175:36.80]Tasks.
[175:39.95]Examine and treat two seagulls!
[175:45.29]Where have you been?
[175:47.64]I've done way more than two.
[175:50.80]Huh?
[175:56.45]I wonder what it's gonna be.
[175:58.29]Hmm?
[175:59.63]Good day.
[176:00.07]While patrolling the eye, I found an animal.
[176:02.29]I wonder.
[176:04.07]Keeping updated on the seagull population.
[176:17.52]Charge my iPad Yeah, yeah, yeah get rid of all the seagulls warts it's fine I'm doing this till we get to see the other animal Then I'm going to bed
[176:50.08]Come on, hurry up!
[176:57.58]Yeah, we've almost been playing this for 10 seagulls worth of time.
[177:00.93]That's too much.
[177:01.57]We need to see the puffin.
[177:02.73]It's a penguin, right?
[177:03.69]Dude, this is my favorite part of the stream.
[177:18.23]This is definitely the best game.
[177:22.24]Give him some vitamins.
[177:25.90]Okay, we only have to do this one more time.
[177:37.95]Go!
[177:38.35]Do it!
[177:40.95]Smear it around!
[177:41.65]I hate these ones.
[177:47.16]These take the longest amount of time.
[177:51.96]Okay.
[177:52.42]You've taken care of this seagull.
[177:53.76]Good.
[177:54.14]Thank you.
[177:54.51]Now you can release him to the wild.
[177:55.73]He's strong enough.
[177:58.47]Animal treat is bird.
[178:04.77]That's not the scientific way to say bird, right?
[178:08.23]Bird?
[178:10.31]I'm just picking that up for the first time.
[178:15.78]Alright.
[178:16.20]We got it.
[178:17.40]Tasks.
[178:19.88]We got our two seagulls are done.
[178:23.35]Our iPad was charged.
[178:25.15]Here comes a puffin.
[178:28.37]We have found another stranded animal.
[178:31.40]I believe you're the right person to come to.
[178:36.78]Can you take a look at it?
[178:38.70]Gladly.
[178:39.10]Could you please bring the animal to the surgery?
[178:41.98]Will do.
[178:42.48]Thanks a lot.
[178:43.51]It's time for our first new animal.
[178:47.55]A puffin.
[178:48.87]Yes!
[178:50.35]It's a puffin.
[178:51.01]No seagull.
[178:52.27]It's a puffin.
[178:54.63]Not a seagull!
[178:56.89]Okay, that's a fucking creepy... How much do you weigh?
[179:06.36]You're not that heavy.
[179:07.30]Finally!
[179:26.76]Oh, wow.
[179:30.04]This is just an Owen Wilson bird.
[179:33.64]Oh, wow.
[179:37.16]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[179:47.37]Good.
[179:47.73]We got a new animal there.
[179:48.87]Cool.
[179:51.89]Yes.
[179:57.71]Now we completed the tutorial.
[180:00.67]I'm so done now.
[180:03.31]That was an Olivia.
[180:07.53]Okay.
[180:08.83]Thank you for completing the tutorial.
[180:11.37]You've done it.
[180:13.26]Your goal summary is done.
[180:14.60]The day is complete.
[180:17.22]End day and save the game.
[180:18.98]Yes.
[180:20.30]End of the day.
[180:22.98]Got nine seagulls.
[180:26.38]One puffin.
[180:28.77]And apparently ten rangers died in the process.
[180:33.45]Who are these ten rangers?
[180:38.47]Alright, it's a new day.
[180:40.87]New day, new animal.
[180:43.51]You did a great job with those birds.
[180:45.74]I also see that you treated a puffin.
[180:48.48]Did you know that besides penguins, puffins are the only birds that swim with their wings?
[180:51.90]I guess that's why their wings are shorter and almost look like fins.
[180:55.18]But dog, can't puffins fly as well?
[180:56.88]Why do we care about puffins and not seagulls?
[181:00.92]This is some extreme puffin bias here.
[181:03.48]It's a beautiful beach, yeah.
[181:10.88]Every day the tide brings in more garbage.
[181:12.86]I have to go clean up the rubbish.
[181:17.20]Almost one million birds and other animals are killed every year.
[181:21.55]See?
[181:22.19]Killed by floating garbage.
[181:24.27]Seagulls, I told you, like 500,000 seagulls die a day.
[181:28.57]One million?
[181:29.25]That's horrible.
[181:30.69]You now see why it's important to clean it up.
[181:32.95]I hope you're not afraid of getting your hands a little dirty.
[181:35.39]He cares about the puffins.
[181:36.35]He doesn't give a shit about the seagulls.
[181:41.23]Alright, so we gotta go down to the beach.
[181:43.93]And clean up the ocean.
[181:51.88]Okay.
[181:56.24]I wanna go to the beach first.
[181:59.49]I know what that's gonna be.
[182:02.77]That's gonna be a seagull.
[182:05.57]See, look at the bias here.
[182:06.79]Look at the bias.
[182:09.16]Dolphin.
[182:13.44]Otter.
[182:15.94]Puffin.
[182:19.51]No seagull.
[182:22.41]That's a lot of bias there for the amount of seagulls I've treated.
[182:26.19]Look at how many seagulls there are.
[182:32.66]Alright, if this is a seagull, I'm gonna end the game.
[182:35.68]Are you guys ready?
[182:41.83]If this is another seagull, I'm going to leave the game.
[182:57.62]I ain't doing that again.
[183:06.07]That seagull did die.
[183:19.25]You're right.
[183:27.34]I can do 10 seagulls is my limit.
[183:30.62]At some point, you gotta be done.
[183:36.46]We have one more game to play and it has nothing to do with animals.
[183:44.49]In fact, it is so far removed from animals that I'm not entirely sure I even want to give it a chance.
[183:57.91]Because this game is called Miss Popularity.
[184:02.93]It's the only other game that's in this package that I have here.
[184:15.10]This popularity.
[184:17.83]We're going out on this one, by the way.
[184:23.85]How many seagulls long in this game?
[184:25.03]Well, each seagull... Each seagull... Let's not count.
[184:30.48]We're going to go nine seagulls of time.
[184:33.06]That was nine seagulls.
[184:35.86]And then maybe if you... The two seconds, I could add it for the tenth.
[184:39.30]So each seagull appointment was, what, a minute and like 10 seconds?
[184:43.60]A minute and 10 seconds?
[184:44.60]A minute and 20 seconds?
[184:46.56]So let's just say 2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 6, 2... I'd say about 12 minutes.
[184:55.42]Like 12 minutes of seagull time.
[184:58.54]There's 9 seagulls.
[185:01.40]And this game ain't even gonna open, is it?
[185:06.57]Oh, Jesus.
[185:13.04]Miss popularity is as taking over the computer And there's a laugh track mostly lost.
[185:19.94]Thanks for the hundred dollars, dude.
[185:21.24]I'm gonna get to that in a second.
[185:22.38]Thank you so much But my computer is literally gonna break and there's a laugh track here I'm gonna go over all the bits before the stream is over.
[185:30.19]I promise but thank you so much, dude That is fucking a hundred seagulls worth of money That's that is each that's a hundred fucking seagulls worth of money I
[185:48.86]Missed popularity.
[185:52.72]Come on, you.
[185:57.36]And THQ.
[186:00.07]Oddly enough.
[186:02.61]Play campaign.
[186:03.97]Free game.
[186:04.57]If I click this, I get a free game.
[186:06.41]Information.
[186:07.15]Play campaign.
[186:10.25]New game.
[186:12.54]I'm not ready for this, I don't think.
[186:15.50]First name.
[186:24.92]Star line.
[186:25.71]I am... What am I?
[186:40.92]Anthony Banthony.
[186:44.50]No, I'm not a cancer.
[186:48.10]I am a... I am a...
[186:51.94]Cap, uh, Aquarius.
[186:54.28]No, I'm a Virgo.
[186:56.19]Where is it?
[186:56.61]Right there.
[186:57.71]Best girlfriend.
[187:01.83]Um, I mean, is this asking me who my girlfriend is?
[187:19.96]Everybody writes Jim.
[187:21.71]I don't have anything else.
[187:25.93]I think this is where I have to be.
[187:27.05]Okay, exit styling.
[187:33.37]I'm waiting for my best friend to get in touch.
[187:35.26]We actually were supposed to meet today.
[187:36.68]Oh, no.
[187:41.92]Take a psychological.
[187:46.84]Take a psychological.
[187:48.23]Let's take it.
[187:49.95]One boy will strut about when you're near.
[187:51.65]Another will totally ignore you but keep staring at you.
[187:54.05]Have you ever wondered what goes through their heads at moments like that?
[187:57.75]Or two, you have a second sense and know everything they're thinking.
[188:00.78]Our test will tell you.
[188:01.70]Another fucking test.
[188:09.88]I just want to skip this.
[188:11.04]I'm just going to pick random answers.
[188:18.61]Somebody's beeping.
[188:25.18]Boris, for you are an unknown quantity.
[188:27.14]You think you know them, but you actually have no idea what takes place in their heads.
[188:31.12]Not all boys are thoughtless machos who only think of themselves.
[188:34.50]They also have their sensitive side.
[188:37.78]But you will only begin to appreciate this if you put aside your prejudices.
[188:42.77]Alright.
[188:45.57]I guess I don't know what makes a man tick.
[188:51.15]Is there a sprint?
[188:53.87]Somebody was beeping, so it's time to get out of the house.
[188:58.99]Okay, I'm off to have a shower.
[189:15.64]What is going on in that toilet?
[189:19.38]Ugh.
[189:23.75]Taking my morning shower in the toilet.
[189:34.68]Why can't I leave?
[189:40.28]Call girlfriend.
[189:41.45]And then?
[189:42.55]Really?
[189:42.89]And then she just went off.
[189:47.03]That's so cool.
[189:49.71]Yes.
[189:50.19]No.
[189:51.67]Really?
[189:52.99]It's gonna be my new resub sound.
[189:56.41]Oh, look, it's... Hi, I'm on the way to the bench by the roundabout in the park.
[190:02.55]I'll wait for you there.
[190:05.51]That's an SMS from you.
[190:23.95]Let's see, let's wash the dishes.
[190:34.38]Who else is eating here with me?
[190:35.88]There's a lot of loud noises.
[190:36.94]Okay, well, what else?
[190:39.10]Cook?
[190:43.81]I love how eating has a full plate, but cooking is an empty pan.
[190:49.99]This is a kind of a chicken before the egg scenario.
[190:54.62]Don't make no sense.
[191:00.32]I'm on the roof of the house.
[191:02.77]No, I'm not.
[191:03.91]I'm outside.
[191:05.45]A guy.
[191:05.95]Man.
[191:06.73]A man.
[191:06.97]There's a man.
[191:07.61]A man.
[191:08.17]A man.
[191:14.81]I can't get out of my house.
[191:16.23]Excuse me.
[191:16.76]Can you help me?
[191:17.34]Excuse me.
[191:19.42]Man.
[191:19.94]Man.
[191:20.18]Oh.
[191:22.56]Oh.
[191:25.73]How do I leave?
[191:26.27]I ate the food before cooking it.
[191:32.73]That doesn't make any sense.
[191:33.47]What else can I do?
[191:34.01]Listen to music?
[191:34.73]This is a creepy fucking girl.
[191:47.23]Okay.
[191:52.57]Hello?
[191:55.81]Oh, this is Dad.
[191:58.11]Okay.
[191:59.47]Dad, you kind of crept up on me here.
[192:01.59]How about us having a campfire barbecue again?
[192:07.22]Oh, yeah, Dad.
[192:08.14]Just like last year.
[192:09.18]It was great.
[192:10.18]I really never knew the fire was so hot.
[192:12.34]I remember you have to put a cloth over your arm when you turn the sausages on the grill tray.
[192:16.91]Oh, yeah.
[192:17.25]Then we roasted marshmallows on sticks.
[192:19.39]Oh, I'm really looking forward to it.
[192:23.29]Because that was his listening meter.
[192:26.03]And he clocked out halfway through I was done with my story.
[192:31.98]Thanks, Dad.
[192:35.46]What else do we got?
[192:36.30]What else can we do here?
[192:38.30]Restyle.
[192:39.76]Learn.
[192:40.84]Take a look.
[192:41.54]Let's learn.
[192:55.12]Alright, so I'm an all green right now.
[192:57.74]That means I am a prime candidate for a man.
[193:00.24]Okay, I'm off to have a shower.
[193:02.03]You just took a shower.
[193:10.19]I just imagine somebody pulling up the toilet seat, pulling up the other toilet seat, and just like stepping in and then squatting in the toilet and taking a ladle and just dumping water all over themselves and then flushing the fucking toilet.
[193:30.30]I'm going to the park, mom, okay?
[193:31.76]His mom.
[193:33.18]Friends and fresh air are wonderful, but when are you going to spend some time with the family?
[193:38.34]If you want to go out in the evening,
[193:40.04]Man!
[193:40.16]Nah, he's boring
[194:02.95]Let me drive the car.
[194:03.69]Please let me drive the car.
[194:04.59]Please let me drive the car.
[194:05.95]Every game that has a car you can drive gets a full fucking letter grade.
[194:09.40]Let me drive the car.
[194:12.40]Now, this same game company has the one part of their engine where it's clean the thing.
[194:18.13]It's the same color.
[194:19.59]It's the same mechanic.
[194:21.21]It's the same code.
[194:22.03]They put it in every one of their fucking games.
[194:24.33]Clean up the dirt.
[194:26.09]Man!
[194:38.44]You're boring.
[194:42.97]Clean the car with the left mouse button.
[194:53.15]This sponge just got way bigger.
[194:56.01]Oh, no.
[194:56.47]Okay, I'm holding it in front of my face.
[195:00.67]$7.2.
[195:03.88]What if I get the whole thing?
[195:17.58]Whose car is that?
[195:21.62]Actually, that's some pretty cool tech.
[195:25.21]You can't give me shit.
[195:26.03]There is a doghouse here.
[195:33.19]Take dog out.
[195:34.95]Press the left mouse button as soon as the level reaches the green zone.
[195:40.93]How much longer do I have to do this?
[196:13.54]557 um I'm gonna be real with you guys if I ever did a job and somebody paid me six dollars and 47 cents it's like you're not even gonna round up to 50.
[196:33.71]You're going to go to the decimal for the work that you think I deserve?
[196:39.83]You round it up to 10, dickhead.
[196:41.43]What are you looking at?
[196:50.41]That was a whole seagull treatment.
[196:56.54]Your first job was $6.55 an hour?
[196:58.58]That's fucking... That's bullshit.
[197:00.54]It should have been $7.
[197:02.26]At least.
[197:02.68]Pick up trash.
[197:11.29]Why am I doing all this stuff in the town?
[197:15.06]I'm running errands for people.
[197:16.34]I'm running random errands for people that don't.
[197:18.12]There's a cat too.
[197:19.54]Is that a dog?
[197:20.66]Is that a cat or a dog?
[197:22.36]What is that?
[197:24.74]That is a cat.
[197:38.23]Interaction for the sake of interaction.
[197:39.95]Alright, well I lost the trash gig.
[197:45.13]So where is boyfriend part of the game?
[197:53.10]Looks like I might have a potential boyfriend situation over here.
[197:57.90]No, that's mom.
[197:58.58]Should I sneak out?
[198:02.86]Oh, I just woke up from a fucking dream.
[198:11.41]Alright, what have we got?
[198:12.01]A couple of things to do here, right?
[198:16.29]We've got distribute flyers.
[198:27.10]How much money do I get for this?
[198:30.00]Man.
[198:30.52]Man.
[198:30.64]I think we've got a man right here.
[198:32.18]No.
[198:32.58]Sorry.
[198:32.84]He's bald.
[198:38.83]Oh, you did it.
[198:39.35]Hooray.
[198:41.32]Carry your bag.
[198:42.10]How nice of you, honey, to help me carry these heavy shopping bags.
[198:47.22]They didn't even want to give an animation.
[198:48.74]Wait, did I bring it all the way back to this person's house?
[198:53.61]Why did I bring her shop- I just stole those shopping bags.
[198:57.21]I lied to that lady.
[199:01.23]Oh yeah, ma'am, let me help you with your groceries.
[199:02.81]And I just went to my house.
[199:05.84]What do you think about that, dad?
[199:07.34]Didn't you want to do something in the garden with your mother?
[199:10.90]Well done, Dad.
[199:11.94]We've put gladioli behind the wall since they grow the tallest.
[199:15.10]And then there are dark red asters in front of them.
[199:18.25]And in front of them, there are busy lizzies, red and white ones alternately.
[199:23.21]And then I planted sweet peas near the wall.
[199:25.33]I hope they come up.
[199:27.19]That's nice, honey.
[199:28.02]I thought this was Mom.
[199:35.17]Mom, how do you make great pancakes?
[199:37.17]This was Mom.
[199:38.35]Oh, it's actually quite simple.
[199:39.89]Oh, first you take a couple of eggs.
[199:42.15]You take flour, eggs, sugar, a pinch of salt, don't forget that, and some creamed butter, and you mix it all together into a thick, smooth batter.
[199:50.56]Then you put some fat into a hot pan and you cook portions of the mixture until golden brown.
[199:55.24]There it is.
[200:02.31]Mom was at the mall, too.
[200:03.45]You can't be two places at once.
[200:11.46]I'm gonna explore just a little bit more.
[200:16.86]That mall had a, maybe, this is the last game, guys.
[200:19.52]This is it.
[200:24.17]There's nothing else after this.
[200:33.81]Go to the park.
[200:34.49]I have no idea where the park is.
[200:44.95]Have I played this for longer than 10 seagulls?
[200:49.43]I'm not sure I have.
[200:50.79]Not yet.
[200:51.09]This is a fucking dead end.
[201:14.61]There is no next.
[201:15.77]You guys don't understand.
[201:19.59]There is no next.
[201:30.78]What's that thing right there?
[201:31.64]There's another place to go down here.
[201:33.40]The park is probably down here.
[201:34.24]I'm going to assume.
[201:41.49]Here we go.
[201:45.01]Here we go!
[201:47.57]No, no shopping center.
[201:48.95]We're going to meet Julie.
[201:54.94]At the school.
[202:03.80]God.
[202:07.49]I'm about to give it up.
[202:08.77]I'm about to give up.
[202:10.41]I'm getting real close to giving up.
[202:13.13]I'm gonna give up.
[202:15.05]I got about 10 seconds before I give up.
[202:22.59]I'm giving up.
[202:25.91]Time to give up.
[202:26.55]I'm giving up.
[202:30.20]I'm leaning really far back in my chair.
[202:41.05]What's this?
[202:42.59]No, it's just wrapping... I... I give up.
[202:45.95]That's it.
[202:46.74]I'm done.
[202:49.20]The morale is really being tested.
[202:51.62]I'm going to have to go to the shopping mall and just go into a funny store.
[203:06.57]What's this?
[203:09.67]I'm not going to take a psychology test here.
[203:15.31]Lounge Club.
[203:16.17]Is this open?
[203:20.99]It is open.
[203:22.73]Open from 7pm.
[203:27.64]What on Earth?
[203:28.66]Am I in a recording studio?
[203:32.96]Play the guitar.
[203:35.24]Press the displayed number keys 1 to 6.
[203:38.96]As soon as they appear in the reaction area.
[203:43.30]Oh my lord.
[203:47.36]Great song.
[203:49.44]You're doing a wonderful job.
[203:52.63]You're doing a great fucking job.
[203:54.47]I can play a better song than this.
[203:59.55]I'm certain of it.
[204:13.59]Seven, seven o'clock.
[204:15.15]How do I come back?
[204:17.03]Open from seven.
[204:20.29]How do I just pass time?
[204:27.60]More workout equipment.
[204:28.60]I need to pass time.
[204:43.41]1833, is this real time?
[204:46.11]Press the arrow keys.
[204:56.72]That really wasn't very good.
[204:58.16]Oh.
[205:00.14]Whoops.
[205:00.30]Look at his tiny feet.
[205:11.41]This thing is like size two.
[205:17.55]It's like doll feet.
[205:29.74]I give up.
[205:31.00]I'm trying.
[205:34.30]Oh my god, I'm trying.
[205:42.73]I can't.
[205:44.45]I got to get out of here.
[205:48.38]I got to get out of here.
[205:54.02]Mom, let's go back home.
[205:58.60]Can I buy anything?
[206:02.36]Buy presents.
[206:08.26]Skateboard bag.
[206:15.95]I can't buy anything.

[214:09.33]Yeah, it's going to be nothing.
[214:17.65]It's not going to be worth doing at all.
[214:26.65]Wow, you're still at this part?
[214:28.27]Yeah.
[214:30.85]You must suck.

[215:05.62]Enjoy the movie.
[215:08.89]Oh my god, of course.
[215:11.31]Just a black fucking screen.
[215:12.67]Nice.
[215:13.05]Thanks for the five dollar deduction.
[215:15.79]Wait, I gotta... That was a lot of time.
[215:17.39]I was gonna watch like five movies.
[215:28.46]I can only watch one movie a day.
[215:36.74]We're almost to seven.
[215:38.02]I'm gonna just wait in front of the club like a weirdo.
[215:52.97]Where's the ice cream?
[215:53.97]I want ice cream.
[215:58.20]You and me are the two sorry losers that are gonna wait here.
[216:06.48]So what did you do today?
[216:09.10]Nothing much.
[216:10.53]Oh, cool.
[216:16.57]This is going to take five minutes.
[216:22.71]IRL streaming though.
[216:23.61]I can't alt tab.
[216:24.47]Yeah.
[216:30.78]How about this?
[216:32.34]I'll give you, I'll give you guys some audio.
[216:35.11]Is that like an audio clip?
[216:38.41]Let's see.
[216:38.69]What can I pull up here?
[216:41.22]Nothing, because my phone battery is at 1%.
[216:43.88]I would have loved to have done something here.
[216:47.92]That would have been nice.
[216:50.72]3 minutes.
[216:59.75]3 stooges.
[217:06.06]Actually, I think I can.
[217:06.86]Can I alt-tab and read bits?
[217:08.42]Alright, I'll be able to read, like, the first handful here.
[217:12.28]There you go.
[217:16.08]SirFeline, thanks for the $1.
[217:17.70]Seagull subsound.
[217:18.84]Also, don't forget your donation tomorrow.
[217:20.66]I won't.
[217:21.98]I will do that as part of my errands tomorrow.
[217:27.98]I know exactly where I'm going to do it.
[217:31.11]But thank you, SirFeline.
[217:31.97]Thank you to ScionTF2 for the $2.
[217:35.83]Just so you know, when Jerma made the Owen Wilson puffin joke, he got that by reading my comment.
[217:41.66]You all laughed with him, but it was my joke.
[217:45.18]I'm going to have to disagree with you.
[217:49.16]Parallel thinking.
[217:49.86]I think we both thought the same thing.
[217:55.75]It was my joke.
[218:00.61]Joke thief.
[218:09.67]You guys do realize.
[218:10.79]Here's something that you guys don't understand.
[218:12.78]Ready?
[218:15.10]Like, it takes me... From when I see something on the screen, you guys see it about 10 to 15 seconds later.
[218:22.32]So, for instance, I'm going to clap right now.
[218:24.59]Ready?
[218:24.81]We're going to do a test.
[218:25.81]Ready?
[218:25.99]Check this out.
[218:26.41]Ready?
[218:27.05]Bang!
[218:27.43]Tell me when you hear that.
[218:28.57]Ready?
[218:29.99]Let's see it.
[218:30.65]I don't see it yet.
[218:32.35]I don't see it.
[218:35.06]Still not there.
[218:38.63]There you go.
[218:39.11]There it is.
[218:40.39]So let's try it one more time.
[218:41.97]We're going to count the amount of seconds, the amount of seagulls it takes before I can see you guys seeing what I just saw.
[218:50.47]Okay, so ready?
[218:52.29]No, I can't do this because everyone's doing it right now.
[218:54.49]How long was that?
[218:55.52]That was about like 8 to 10 seconds.
[219:00.54]Now I hear you.
[219:01.64]I just heard the first clap.
[219:05.38]And the point is,
[219:07.03]is me talking and playing the game, like right here.
[219:11.30]You're going to see this like 10 to 15 seconds after I do it.
[219:16.00]That's how it works.
[219:17.34]There's like a 10 to 15 second delay on Twitch.
[219:21.97]So, come on man.
[219:27.05]There's a clap.
[219:29.49]Anyways, thank you though, thank you sign.
[219:33.33]Latency to broadcaster is seven seconds.
[219:36.67]So I'm in the fucking, I am in the future right now, guys.
[219:45.03]You guys are seeing I'm from the future.
[219:50.62]If I get, if something crazy happens, okay, let's just say, let's say there's an earthquake right now.
[219:57.08]I'm going to feel it.
[219:58.28]Holy shit, a fucking earthquake.
[220:00.65]What?
[220:01.25]And then seven seconds later, you guys are going to get the earthquake.
[220:04.43]That's how it works.
[220:06.06]And then you're gonna shake around and be like, holy fuck, what?
[220:12.92]Anyways, thank you, though.
[220:15.02]Thank you also.
[220:15.60]Mostly Lost gave $100 earlier.
[220:18.70]Thank you so much, Most Lost.
[220:21.72]Press F to pay respects for our dead bard friend.
[220:28.38]I'm so glad that fucking seagulls turned into a stupid joke.
[220:34.38]I can't, like, that was just so dumb.
[220:36.30]Everything about that was fucking perfect.
[220:37.82]I loved it every second of it.
[220:40.40]But thank you, MostlyLost, for the $100.
[220:41.82]That's incredibly generous of you.
[220:48.95]McJams, thanks for the $1.
[220:50.55]Good memes, good seagulls, good stream.
[220:52.39]Thanks, Jeremy.
[220:52.85]Well, thank you.
[220:53.61]Thank you, McJams.
[220:55.67]Oh, 7 o'clock.
[220:56.57]7 o'clock.
[220:56.77]7, 7, 7, 7.
[220:56.87]Let's go.
[221:07.64]I'll take one of you scientists in chat to explain to me how that's possible.
[221:18.85]It doesn't even exist.
[221:19.53]It's fake.
[221:19.97]It's a lie.
[221:22.51]We said it for no reason.
[221:24.87]Open from 7pm.
[221:25.37]17 is 5.
[221:25.55]What are you talking about? 12...
[221:34.47]I don't go on, I go on regular minus 12 time.
[221:40.47]It's 5, fuck it, 5 p.m.
[221:46.08]It's 5 p.m., I know, but I'm like reading bits over here, I'm like trying to catch the fucking train to the club.
[221:52.46]I'm like reading chat, reading bits, reading the screen, like there's a lot going on here.
[222:01.56]I'm ten seconds in the fucking future, like, there's a lot in my brain swimming around.
[222:05.35]1900.
[222:09.35]Anyways, thank you to, uh, thank you Jauntman for the five dollars.
[222:19.89]They just say, um, they just say the word, they just, okay, they just, they just say the word, come.
[222:27.44]Like, come over here.
[222:29.90]Like, come on over.
[222:32.82]For some reason.
[222:33.34]I don't know why.
[222:35.58]Phil White, thanks for the $1.
[222:36.86]I've watched your channel for hundreds of seagulls, Jerma.
[222:39.13]Oh, that's good.
[222:42.21]That's good.
[222:44.73]That's actually, that's not that long.
[222:47.91]Yeah, it is.
[222:48.33]Holy shit.
[222:48.79]That's like fucking, that's like 60 hours.
[222:52.92]Thank you so much, dude.
[222:54.32]Glad you're still sticking around.
[222:57.20]Hey, Peter the Peter, thanks for the $1.
[223:00.35]Thank you so much, Peter.
[223:00.91]I hope you enjoy the streams.
[223:32.32]Any amount of happiness I can give to anybody means a lot.
[223:38.61]I'm glad you think so.
[223:42.39]So, thank you, dude.
[223:47.06]We are exactly 12 seconds away from going into the club.
[223:54.26]I cannot wait.
[223:57.72]The last 30 minutes of this stream have been for this moment.
[224:01.33]Let's hope it's worth it.
[224:05.36]Count it down.
[224:06.28]Three, two, one.
[224:08.64]Here it goes.
[224:17.47]What?
[224:17.73]Your mom just told me that you were out for the whole day again.
[224:20.13]Tonight is going to be a family occasion.
[224:24.54]Oh, fuck you, dad.
[224:26.64]I'm going to dance at the club.
[224:37.07]Aren't you glad we waited for this?
[224:55.28]That's very much a sidelines dance.
[225:02.49]This is a terrible club.
[225:03.63]Is that a DJ?
[225:07.20]Nice.
[225:11.27]Sing the rat song to this?
[225:16.79]It actually kind of is that song.
[225:18.67]Yeah, it works.
[225:36.72]Well, that was fun.
[225:40.96]Let's play the guitar.
[225:41.82]No, that's it.
[225:43.04]Exit.
[225:45.94]That's it.
[225:46.22]The stream's over.
[225:52.18]That's the end of the stream.
[225:53.30]Thank you for watching.
[225:58.22]Hey, Paranoia, thank you for the $1.
[226:00.17]Jermo, you're a pretty swell guy.
[226:01.83]Been around since 2013.
[226:02.45]Love you.
[226:02.71]Well...
[226:06.01]Let's time travel 2013.
[226:07.39]There's at least two or three of you that have said that.
[226:11.09]Thank you, Paranoia.
[226:12.31]Thank you, Peter.
[226:14.57]From the past, 2013.
[226:21.07]Kaltari, thanks for the $1.

[226:29.74]Thank you, Kaltari.

[226:40.48]Am... Amco the Terrible, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[226:47.11]Go home to your family, young man.
[226:52.15]You gotta listen to dad.
[226:52.90]When dad tells you to do something...
[226:57.36]You have to do it, otherwise you're in big fucking trouble.
[226:59.78]I don't want to be in big trouble, so I quit the game.
[227:02.22]I don't want them to see me, what I'm doing.
[227:08.26]Hey, Seven Nation, thanks for the bits.
[227:10.72]I can't believe I've been watching this shitty content for five years.
[227:18.44]What is that?
[227:18.86]Does that say something about me, or does that say something about you?
[227:21.84]I'm not sure.
[227:25.99]Does that say something about me?
[227:29.25]Who's at fault here or there?
[227:30.17]I'm not sure.
[227:32.87]Ban that guy for life.
[227:33.71]Anyways, thank you, little dude.
[227:44.88]Thank you.
[227:50.35]I can't believe I've been watching this shitty streamer for 6,000 seagulls.
[227:53.41]Oh, you guys are fucking awesome.
[227:59.69]Appreciate it, though, man.
[228:00.67]Thank you.
[228:03.07]SirFeline, thanks for the $1 rap movie post-stream joke.
[228:05.99]I just did... Everyone that was asking for a rap movie, I just did it.
[228:08.77]I just did it live.
[228:09.84]I did the whole... I did the whole movie.
[228:15.22]key and enter thank you for the one dollar hey Jerma thanks for all that you do you work hard for the streams and your videos and I've been watching your shame do the same shitty content for god knows how long I have uh well he didn't he didn't actually say that I'm just adding that to it's a comical context for a previous
[228:35.21]But, uh, they say, You work hard for the streams and your videos, and I've been watching you for god knows how long.
[228:40.37]I too have struggled emotionally, but I always get so goddamn happy when I see a video or stream from you.
[228:45.59]I love your content.
[228:46.29]Please keep doing what you do.
[228:50.45]I will.
[228:53.35]For as long as I can.
[228:55.39]I don't know how long that'll be.
[228:58.73]Who knows?
[229:00.53]I might be still making videos and streaming and whatever the next platform is.
[229:06.49]For another 10 years.
[229:08.17]I don't have any idea.
[229:10.81]I never got into this with any intention to do something that I wasn't interested in.
[229:15.35]You know?
[229:19.29]Once you guys will know when I'm done.
[229:21.79]When I don't have any fun anymore.
[229:24.39]Because if I don't have any more fun, then it's not going to be worth doing.
[229:30.83]If I don't have any more ideas, if I don't have any more fun things I'd like to try, that's when you'll know, and I'm not gonna get there for a very long time.
[229:41.60]An eternal servitude to Twitch.
[229:46.38]But there's no way to tell anything, you know, like... I didn't even know, when I first started making videos, that I was gonna make more than three.
[229:59.07]I made two videos in one day, and then one more video, like, two days later.
[230:04.25]And I was like, alright, that was cool!
[230:07.53]That was kind of fun!
[230:09.47]Yeah, that was, that was interesting.
[230:11.29]I'm not, probably not gonna do that again.
[230:13.97]And then, like, somebody started watching.
[230:16.91]And then I got, like, a couple viewers.
[230:20.99]There are people here.
[230:22.67]There are people watching this?
[230:25.29]Wow, cool, okay!
[230:26.89]Let's make another one!
[230:28.46]I thought that maybe, like, I'd pick another ten.
[230:31.16]And then a thousand videos later, and hundreds of hours at this point on stream, here we are.
[230:36.93]Six or seven years later, just about.
[230:38.55]Six years or so?
[230:43.41]Well, I have not found a reason to stop yet, so why would I know?
[230:47.39]Thank you.
[230:47.69]Appreciate it.
[230:53.29]Key and enter again, thanks for the $1.
[230:55.27]Accidentally inspired a speech from him.
[230:57.13]Whoops.
[231:00.80]I'm a talker, man.
[231:03.16]Thanks, though.
[231:03.58]Thank you, SirFelan, for the $1.
[231:04.70]Are the seagulls replacing the rats now?
[231:06.46]Save the rats.
[231:07.34]Hashtag.
[231:09.12]You can never save the rats, even though seagulls eat rats.
[231:12.70]So maybe you should be scared about it.
[231:15.83]Zeno, Pika, thanks for the $1.
[231:17.47]Thanks for the laughs tonight, man.
[231:18.99]Thank you for being here.
[231:20.21]Thanks for sticking around.
[231:20.93]Thanks for...
[231:22.59]bearing with the weird shit.
[231:27.16]Thank you.
[231:29.54]Uh, Clink180 with $1.
[231:31.66]Hey, Jerma, it's me again.
[231:32.64]My 23rd birthday is on Friday.
[231:34.46]A lot of birthdays.
[231:35.94]Honestly, a lot of birthdays last, like, a week or two.
[231:39.42]I've noticed.
[231:39.82]I've got some fall birthdays in here.
[231:43.11]Fall into winter.
[231:44.57]I'm really looking forward to a stream then rather than seeing the new Star Wars movie.
[231:48.57]Keep up the good work.
[231:49.23]Fuck, the new Star Wars movie does come out.
[231:55.56]I gotta get, I gotta, I gotta watch that.
[231:59.42]Not on opening day.
[232:01.44]Never go to a Star Wars movie on opening day.
[232:04.80]There's gonna be like, there's gonna be at least like 12 adults there dressed in costumes.
[232:11.28]There'll be like four Darth Vader's and they'll be fighting down, pretending to have a sword battle in the front row.
[232:17.79]And nobody ever shuts the fuck up during a premiere.
[232:21.00]If you go to a very, very hugely, highly anticipated film during its opening night and everybody screams and cheers and shit when something good happens, like Han Solo will go, Don't get down, kid!
[232:34.73]Look out!
[232:36.77]Yeah!
[232:37.67]Yeah!
[232:38.51]It's like fucking... I'm just trying to watch the movie.
[232:40.75]Everyone laughs their ass off at the marginally funny jokes.
[232:49.86]Don't ever go to a movie on its premiere night.
[232:51.68]You go like two or three days later.
[232:57.03]I clapped when I saw things I remembered.
[232:59.33]Yeah, exactly.
[233:02.49]The Millennium Falcon drives by and you got like the eight guys in the back that are like, that's what I'm talking about.
[233:09.97]Bring it back, baby.
[233:12.65]And that's when I stand up.
[233:13.51]I stand up and be like, this whole movie was made.
[233:18.62]Just to appease you fuck faces.
[233:21.58]The entire film was made.
[233:23.22]Disney bought this franchise for you to clap in the back like you just did.
[233:28.06]Thank you for proving this correct.
[233:33.40]Go buy another commemorative mug.
[233:36.66]And then I sit down and all of a sudden I hear a couple of claps over here.
[233:39.51]All of a sudden two people down there start clapping.
[233:42.25]I get a raucous, a roarous applause.
[233:45.97]And then I stand up.
[233:48.62]And I take a bow.
[233:50.74]And then it becomes my movie.
[233:56.44]Yeah, I can see that.
[234:04.62]And then it cuts to me in the back of a squad car.
[234:09.47]But thank you to...
[234:12.80]Thank you too.
[234:14.14]Let's go down here.
[234:16.44]Hey, you just came in there.
[234:17.76]Chowderhead.
[234:19.26]For the $1.
[234:20.82]Jerma, I'm sorry for the comments about wanting baseball bat seagulls to death.
[234:24.79]I just live on Boston's North Shore and around here they are just the worst.
[234:31.09]It's alright.
[234:35.19]Chowderhead.
[234:35.87]That threw me on a rollercoaster.
[234:42.41]I was crying laughing during that, because at that point, that was like the sixth or seventh seagull in a row.
[234:48.89]It was a chain of events.
[234:49.95]But, thank you, dude.
[234:54.90]Also, the May- the Maybe Dog, for one dollar.
[234:58.28]Hey, Jern and Science Twist.
[235:02.04]The Trick and Tip.
[235:03.46]Counting from the twelve... From twelve, the hour always work, you see?
[235:10.22]Smiley face.
[235:13.57]Um, you might want to figure out who, right before you wrote what you wrote, hit you in the head with a wrench.
[235:19.34]Did somebody just, like... Because it was all jarbled.
[235:23.90]I don't know that.
[235:27.08]I would get angry at the person that just kind of, like, dropped a piano on your head.
[235:35.16]Thank you, MaybeDog.
[235:39.47]Okay, did you just put into Google Translate a bunch of random stuff?
[235:47.78]To me, that comes out as a Google Translate.
[235:53.26]Seagulls fight back.
[235:55.08]Now, all jokes aside, thank you so much, MaybeDuck.
[235:58.10]Appreciate it.
[236:02.86]and Going back some father.
[236:04.86]We got gaming trickster.
[236:05.84]Thanks for the bits.
[236:06.40]I don't understand.
[236:07.06]Can you convert that to seagulls?
[236:12.74]Yeah, sir feline thanks for the $1 we got these going down to Fill white thanks for the $1 frisky moose.
[236:28.55]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[236:29.13]I
[236:30.99]I'm playing Pokémon while watching and managed to catch a shiny buzzwool during the stream.
[236:36.11]I'm naming him Jermuscle in honor of the best streamer.
[236:41.02]Frisky Moose, congratulations on your shiny.
[236:45.62]Don't know what that is.
[236:47.16]Although I did watch a video a long time ago of a kid that had like eight Game Boy Advances set up.
[236:54.80]And he was just spamming in the grass on all of them.
[236:58.76]something it's a task he had apparently been doing for at least like four or five hours straight and and he finally got one and just started screaming there it is there it is there it is there it is it's a really funny video congratulations yeah I I did make sam watch that video I did
[237:28.73]Thank you to the chowderhead, again, a couple times here for two bucks.
[237:34.30]Do you see now why I must do my civic duty?
[237:36.62]Sky rats are a plague upon us all.
[237:38.94]Cats can't see.
[237:40.71]Vets because too many seagulls are clogging up vet offices.
[237:43.77]They must die so that others can live.
[237:46.19]Give me the money, Jerma.
[237:47.31]Give me a new bat so that I can perform my god-given tasks.
[237:53.45]And then he wrote, Jerma, it's me, the guy who hates seagulls.
[237:56.79]When I was... Like, really on this seagull thing.
[238:02.13]When I was six, a seagull swooped down and stole my grilled cheese sandwich.
[238:07.32]And I've had nothing but terrible experiences with those goddamn sky rats.
[238:11.40]Please, Jerma, for the love of all that is holy, give me money for more bats so that I can... Holy shit.
[238:21.87]That's a deep-seated hatred Thank You techno toast with bits cool cat thanks for the 245 seagull doctor is my new favorite joke My new favorite Jerm a joke.
[238:35.56]I can't stop laughing.
[238:36.46]Thank you so much.
[238:37.04]I Think we all got quite a lot of enjoyment from the seagull Colin Jett's thanks for the $1 seagull vet the movie the game.
[238:50.77]I
[238:52.83]Kind of what we planned.
[238:56.83]Sorry.
[239:02.96]I want to, like, take myself back to when he originally wrote that comment in the chat and just put myself back to where, like, I was cry laughing at, like, that whole thing.
[239:11.78]If I could rewind time and, like, relive that moment, I would love to.
[239:16.19]That's a relive this moment part that I would love to do.
[239:27.91]Wait, Jerma made fun of a foreign guy?
[239:29.97]What are you talking about?
[239:31.05]You're talking about the Hello Jerma science twist, the trick and tip guy?
[239:43.52]Well, I apologize if that's the case.
[239:54.41]I didn't make fun of him!
[239:55.41]I didn't make fun of him!
[239:57.05]I didn't do that!
[240:09.40]I'm not mean.
[240:10.18]No, I'm not mean.
[240:11.71]Look, people fuck with me all the time.
[240:14.07]Go on.
[240:15.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[240:16.23]Rewind.
[240:19.51]Breaks.
[240:20.78]People fuck with me all the time.
[240:22.92]People write such crazy shit in these messages.
[240:26.83]That sometimes... You said he got his head bashed.
[240:31.31]No, that's not what I've said.
[240:33.53]That's not what I meant.
[240:34.97]I thought this was somebody messing around with me.
[240:37.99]Making a little, you know, gotcha jebaited kind of joke here.
[240:40.91]You said he...
[240:50.93]Oh wait, so when you get bullied, you're allowed to bully.
[240:53.74]That's not it!
[240:54.58]No!
[240:55.62]I thought, alright, we're gonna move on from this.
[240:57.38]Ow, my fingernail.
[241:00.20]Oh wait, you did get me.
[241:02.32]This isn't your baby yet.
[241:11.47]You're making him self-conscious.
[241:14.27]You guys gotta give me break.
[241:15.29]I get fucked with like hundreds of times a day when I stream.
[241:20.57]In the chat, in messages, on Twitter.
[241:25.09]Sometimes it's hard to tell what could be real and what could be fake.
[241:27.99]It doesn't even matter.
[241:28.51]I told you like 80% of the... Okay, let's go ahead.
[241:31.13]I've made my apology.
[241:32.91]I've made my public apology.
[241:34.93]I'm sorry.
[241:37.89]Let's go.
[241:41.03]You're still at this part.
[241:42.09]Alright, let's go back all the way to the beginning.
[241:47.06]Four hours ago.
[241:48.95]Thank you, uh, NorthrendFP for the three bucks.
[241:54.73]Cheer, cheer, cheer.
[241:55.35]Here's the hundred bits I promised I would give if Etalyx dabbed.
[241:58.90]The rest is for my favorite putt-putt speedrunner.
[242:02.32]I will deposit that into Etalyx' bank account.
[242:04.94]Thank you so much, NorthrendFP, for the three bucks.
[242:08.52]Uh, Tell, thank you, Tell, for the $7.55.
[242:10.64]Jerma, I'll give you $7.55 bits if you play Neopets.
[242:17.02]Except I already am giving you it with this message.
[242:21.00]I mean, I did technically play Neopets.
[242:24.54]I played Neopets.
[242:27.37]I didn't like it.
[242:27.93]Like, it was weird.
[242:28.89]It was just a webpage.
[242:31.15]I couldn't get it set up right.
[242:32.05]And it wasn't going to be that fun on stream.
[242:33.33]So, yeah, I mean, I technically did.
[242:34.75]So, thanks for the $7.55, dude.
[242:36.13]Appreciate it.
[242:39.07]SpicySkeletor, NightfangX7, thanks for the $1.00.
[242:42.37]BrainZero, thanks for the $1.00.
[242:45.26]Nightfang says, Some of those action games that are like Darksiders and Devil May Cry, God of War, I never got into any of them.
[243:11.63]So correct me if I'm wrong here.
[243:13.83]I'm not saying that any of these are not good games.
[243:16.35]I just want to make sure I have the genre correct.
[243:21.04]Is Darksiders one of those... Here's your giant across the screen health bar.
[243:27.12]And you have a meter that builds up.
[243:29.98]And you hack and slash the fuck out of enemies.
[243:32.14]A bunch of enemies fill an area.
[243:34.40]You hack and slash the fuck out of them with a bunch of different combos.
[243:37.60]And then you move on to the next area and do it all over again.
[243:43.08]Is that what it is?
[243:50.29]Nope, it's Zelda.
[243:52.11]Okay.
[243:54.57]Dark Shadows 1 is more of a Zelda game.
[243:59.49]The way I see like a lot of those Devil May Cry, God of War type games is like Doom, but third-person hack and slash.
[244:08.64]Fill a bunch of enemies in a room, get cool combos and cool abilities, and then do it all over again.
[244:15.62]Darksiders is more like Zelda.
[244:16.70]Oh, I didn't know that.
[244:17.32]Okay.
[244:18.70]Interesting.
[244:20.37]No, I never played it.
[244:22.19]Hey, Jeremy, you're dumb.
[244:26.59]Well, I'm rubber and you're glue, and whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.
[244:31.91]Sorry about that, man.
[244:41.34]Thank you to Cardboard Crackling for the $5.
[244:46.02]Cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer.
[244:47.26]Memes.
[244:48.50]Thank you.
[244:49.40]Cardboard Crackling.
[244:51.76]Albert McMull, thanks for the $1.
[244:53.42]Hey, Jerma, my last donation I think you got.
[244:55.25]I think I got you mixed up with someone else.
[244:58.77]But anyway, I can't wait for your guest appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast next week.
[245:09.04]Well, uh, you got some misinformation there.
[245:16.25]Yeah, I'll be on the Joe Rogan podcast next week, talking about deprivation chambers.
[245:25.54]Hey, Stompy, thanks for the $5.15.
[245:28.54]If I could fall into the sky, do you think time would pass me by?
[245:33.24]Oh, because you know I'd walk a thousand miles just to see Otto on a stream tonight.
[245:40.31]Thank you, Stompy, for the $5.15.
[245:41.25]I'm not, I'm not, I'm just, that was, that was like a joke about, like, I'm not gonna be on the fucking Joe Rogan podcast.
[245:53.43]Why would I be on there?
[245:56.82]Of all the people that could be on the Joe Rogan podcast, in this scene, in this area, in this platform, why would it be me?
[246:08.78]The stream is over.
[246:09.76]Can't you see the screen?
[246:10.54]Yeah, it is.
[246:14.30]Thank you, OG Jeff Tor, for the ten bucks.
[246:17.35]I've had these bits since Thanksgiving with the intent to give them to you, but haven't caught a stream since.
[246:21.75]You're the best, Jerry.
[246:23.09]Hope you're still here, OG Jeff Tor.
[246:25.37]Because thank you for the ten dollars.
[246:28.24]You are a fucking awesome, generous person.
[246:33.40]Thank you.
[246:36.16]Don't be so humble.
[246:40.13]If Joe Rogan sees a Jerma rumble, he'll lump you on.
[246:43.87]No, he won't.
[246:44.53]He's a UFC guy.
[246:48.17]He doesn't give a shit about, like, the Milkman from fucking WWE 2K14.
[246:56.56]Eleanor, thank you for the $5.
[246:59.54]I just finished watching your Getting Over It VOD and saw you were streaming.
[247:02.92]Thank you for a four-hour-long comedy show.
[247:05.86]Never laughed so much for so long.
[247:08.60]That game was...
[247:10.45]That game was painful.
[247:14.17]My brain turned off halfway through that stream.
[247:17.64]And... I don't know what took over.
[247:20.38]Something else took over.
[247:21.26]Like a demon.
[247:22.00]I got possessed during that stream.
[247:24.16]I don't even remember half that stream.
[247:26.06]And I was totally of sound mind and body.
[247:32.08]Thank you, Bird Robot.
[247:33.92]Bird Robot.
[247:35.66]Captain Clutch TM.
[247:39.42]Uh, what is your favorite animal and do you prefer them crispy or grilled?
[247:42.64]Uh, well, if you're talking about food, I'd probably say chicken or turkey.
[247:47.01]If you're talking about a domesticated house animal, I'd be a dog and they're not eaten.
[247:55.17]They're my friend.
[247:58.79]Uh, Xenopika, thanks for the $1.
[248:00.17]What the hell is this stream?
[248:03.35]Well, maybe you figured it out while you were here.
[248:08.69]Sometimes you get a taste.
[248:11.19]You came in, you get a taste.
[248:12.15]It's a little bit sour at first.
[248:13.28]A little bitter.
[248:15.50]Kind of stinks a little bit when you put it in your mouth.
[248:18.20]And then eventually you get the sweetness.
[248:20.38]The outer coating.
[248:21.44]The bitter outer coating falls away and you got a little bit of cream there.
[248:24.86]You got some creamy, sugary shit there in your mouth.
[248:28.53]And then it dissolves.
[248:29.41]And the very center is just pure bacon fat.
[248:36.51]It's delish.
[248:38.53]Welcome.
[248:39.05]Enjoy your stay.
[248:41.34]Smokewise Ganja, thanks for the $3.
[248:44.38]When are we getting Jerm of Fashion from?
[248:47.94]Soon.
[248:49.66]Oh, that's also my... The two favorite parts of the stream for me were the runway contest and Vetsiegel.
[248:58.51]It was great stuff.
[249:01.43]A lot of fun.
[249:02.67]Forest Tournament, thanks for the $1.
[249:03.93]What a success story.
[249:05.05]Thank you.
[249:05.81]Talking about me, I think.
[249:07.33]Lenzy6, thanks for the $3.
[249:09.39]Finlandia.
[249:11.55]Finlandia.
[249:16.20]And then a bunch of stuff.
[249:19.28]A bunch of stuff that I don't know how to pronounce.
[249:22.60]A lot of words here, and a lot of what seem to be accents on them.
[249:27.44]But I can't, I don't know what they are.
[249:29.87]But thank you, Lenzy6, for the $3.
[249:34.75]Finland isn't real.
[249:36.05]What?
[249:41.23]Bullied?
[249:41.83]No, I just, I don't, I don't want to like butcher this.
[249:45.08]I don't want to read this out loud and sound like a fucking dickie.
[249:53.62]That's embarrassing.
[249:54.58]I don't, that's like, that's, that is like worse than me reading it.
[250:04.16]But thank you, LenZ6.
[250:06.82]Also, thank you to TechnoToast again.
[250:08.58]And bless your computer, because I think that game cursed your PC.
[250:15.39]It definitely did.
[250:17.87]Oh, NightfangX, thanks for the $1.00.
[250:22.71]No, actually, you know, the real next anime that's on the list for me to watch?
[250:28.05]I give myself a quota and a limit.
[250:32.35]There's a quota and a limit of one anime per year that I will watch.
[250:38.58]One a year.
[250:41.88]Last year was Steins Gate.
[250:44.42]And thumbs down on that one.
[250:48.59]I was, like, sad that my yearly quota and limit was taken up by Steins Gate.
[250:52.74]Thumbs down on that one.
[250:54.38]And I could argue with it about why all day.
[251:01.02]What do you mean, what?
[251:04.76]What do you mean, what?
[251:05.42]Yeah, I was told to watch it.
[251:06.96]I was told it had an interesting concept.
[251:12.65]I didn't like it.
[251:16.61]So now, like, this year's limit is My Hero Academia.
[251:21.54]Is that.
[251:22.98]It seems like it could be alright.
[251:29.42]Thumbs down on Steins Gate?
[251:30.96]Are you high?
[251:35.86]Don't call me a normie, because I didn't like Steins Gate.
[251:42.80]I'm not gonna talk about Steins Gate because I don't want to spoil it.
[251:45.90]There is no spoiler!
[251:53.64]Oh no, this normie doesn't like Steins Gate.
[251:56.94]Oh god.
[252:04.54]You are a normie if you watch Hero AC instead of JoJo.
[252:11.56]But that guy, I have a year.
[252:14.23]Do you want me to go over my yearly quota?
[252:17.29]And limit.
[252:20.33]JoJo is the ultimate normie anime.
[252:23.17]What is this normie shit?
[252:26.27]I am kind of a normal guy.
[252:28.69]With really weird tendencies.
[252:38.94]No, Heroes AC is good.
[252:47.35]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[252:48.57]No, you don't understand.
[252:51.53]Like, there's no in-between.
[252:52.53]This is what's wrong with the world now.
[252:55.27]You're not allowed to fucking be in-between.
[252:57.49]It's either you're a normie, or you're like a fucking, like, neckbeard loser turd.
[253:02.88]Like, there's no in-between.
[253:05.22]Like, you're a normie, or you're a fucking basement-dwelling neckbeard.
[253:10.80]It's like, can't I have a beard on my neck and be a normal person?
[253:16.91]Can't I, can't I, like, browse the internet?
[253:21.11]Can't I browse dumb fucking crazy websites, but also have like a fucking degree, like PhD?
[253:28.61]No.
[253:29.93]No.
[253:32.41]Why can't I do both?
[253:34.86]Why can't I be a fucking weirdo and then put on a suit and be a fucking normal person at a wedding?
[253:44.64]Why can't I collect jars of my own spit?
[253:49.46]Full of, I have full jars of my own saliva that I keep on my shelf and I label them, I number them and I label them.
[253:59.06]Why can't I do that but also go on a skiing trip with my family?
[254:06.00]You gotta have fucking, you gotta be one.
[254:08.06]You can't be anything, you can't, be everything.
[254:11.59]Don't be one thing.
[254:21.44]I guess he could just... He could do that last one.
[254:29.14]He crossed the line.
[254:30.72]Wait, what is he talking about?
[254:31.64]I'm talking about like... I'm making a... We're just being weird.
[254:35.86]See?
[254:36.44]Would a fucking normie have this kind of conversation?
[254:39.21]No.
[254:40.51]They wouldn't.
[254:42.17]They would talk about their fantasy fucking football.
[254:46.24]And you know what?
[254:46.68]That's fine.
[254:47.82]That's fine.
[254:48.52]You could be... You could, like, enjoy fantasy football.
[254:52.74]And also... Like to... Go, like, ice skating.
[254:59.01]Naked.
[255:00.63]That's alright.
[255:01.97]As long as it's, like, in your backyard and you have a big fence.
[255:06.01]It's alright.
[255:07.57]And, like, nobody can see you.
[255:08.45]It's privacy of your own home.
[255:10.17]Who cares?
[255:16.61]Anyways, thank you to Travelboy for the $1.
[255:20.73]This is why you're a meme streamer.
[255:23.27]Meme streamer confirmed by Mostly Lost.
[255:26.39]Super Smash Bros.
[255:27.17]Melee, Icarus, $5.
[255:28.09]Hey, Jerma, since you're already playing pet games, will you play Okami HD?
[255:37.94]Um... Without, like, stepping on any toes and making anybody angry at what I'm saying here...
[255:45.39]Didn't Okami HD, like, come out already, like, four years ago?
[255:50.29]Wasn't there, like, an Okami remake they already did?
[255:53.25]Is this a remake?
[255:54.17]Is this an HD remake of the HD remake that came out?
[256:02.23]Okami HD is an HD remake of the HD remake that they remade Okami original remake. ...
[256:15.17]Was Okami on PC before this one?
[256:24.88]So it's a double HD.
[256:27.40]Okay, that's alright.
[256:29.16]So it's an HD HD.
[256:33.63]You ice skating freak.
[256:38.01]There was no Okami on PC.
[256:40.09]Alright, okay.
[256:41.71]Let me back up.
[256:43.22]Alright, cool.
[256:45.74]I was under the assumption that the game had gotten, like, an HD remake already.
[256:49.94]And it did.
[256:50.90]On, like, the Wii.
[256:51.36]And then after that.
[256:55.04]But it's never been on PC, that's cool.
[256:57.16]You get to see great PC game development here.
[257:02.37]Tested through the annals of history.
[257:07.44]We get a PC release for like one of the greatest video games in quotes of all time.
[257:11.32]Like six years after it comes out.
[257:14.36]It's a long time.
[257:18.80]Thanks, guys.
[257:20.70]Thank you also to... Fourth consecutive line for the $5.
[257:29.69]$5 to stop.
[257:30.03]That will be soon, don't worry.
[257:35.97]Dan with wings, thanks for the $5.
[257:37.47]Let's be honest, at this point, that was the peak of this stream.
[257:39.92]Tiki-taka, seagulls.
[257:43.12]Uh, hey, Ratuna, thanks for the bits.
[257:44.70]Hey, Jerm, are those animal meme faces gonna possibly be emotes?
[257:49.08]No, I feel like I forgot I even did that.
[257:51.31]You just reminded me of what everyone will arguably tell you is the worst part of this stream.
[257:59.75]I forgot I did it.
[258:00.61]I already burned that in my brain furnace.
[258:05.04]It's already gone.
[258:07.21]Thank you.
[258:08.90]Official blue apron.
[258:12.50]Hey Jerma, follow the one blue apron on Twitter to get a real sponsorship.
[258:16.68]Haha, don't tell them it's fake chat.
[258:20.86]You did get me yesterday, you did.
[258:23.34]I honestly thought that was actually the official blue apron because everyone was telling me that they were hitting me up on Twitter.
[258:27.59]And I was like shilling them as a joke.
[258:31.85]But thanks.
[258:34.63]Uh, Crimble's
[258:39.68]They say, hey, crumbles crunchy.
[258:41.60]Thank you, crunchy.
[258:43.76]For the 80 cents.
[258:47.06]Commander, thanks for the 35 bits.
[258:48.48]Hey, why do you subject yourself to so much punishment?
[258:52.02]I don't think it's punishment.
[258:57.17]Cyan, TF2, thanks for the $1.
[258:58.79]Google tells me 13 million birds die a day in the US.
[259:03.71]I believe it.
[259:05.11]There's more birds than people on Earth.
[259:08.54]There are like 11 billion people on Earth.
[259:11.73]I think at last scientific count, there were 40 or 50 billion birds.
[259:19.59]And 30 or 40 billion of them are seagulls.
[259:21.57]So, it makes sense.
[259:25.87]E-Cookie, thanks for the bits.
[259:26.75]Daddy, Jerma, when are you and Mommy going to get the house back?
[259:30.53]I don't know.
[259:33.22]The Pat Marcins, thanks for the $1.
[259:36.36]Buy $100 of french fries to give to the gulls.
[259:43.46]dolls.
[259:45.68]And I think that... I think that catches me up.
[259:48.82]Let's see if I missed any from the last couple minutes.
[259:53.84]Chowderhead, thanks for the $1 five minutes ago.
[259:57.83]Show us the jars, you normie neckbeard weeboo Chad.
[260:01.25]Nah, I ain't fucking... No labels, man.
[260:07.48]No labels for me.
[260:10.10]You know what I am?
[260:10.90]You know who I am?
[260:13.20]Me.
[260:16.30]Is it?
[260:19.38]Farathor, thank you for the $1.
[260:20.87]Hey, Jerma, how long does it usually take you to make the Jerma Rumble characters?
[260:23.83]Um... I feel like it depends.
[260:29.61]Between like 45 minutes to like an hour and a half for each character.
[260:34.40]Like Earthworm Jim took like an hour and 45 minutes.
[260:37.85]Probably the longest character that I've ever made.
[260:41.13]I was just trying to get him perfect.
[260:43.27]It was more than an hour at least.
[260:46.60]So, yeah.
[260:47.90]On average, probably like 45 minutes per character.
[260:53.02]Maybe a little more.
[260:57.24]And also to Seabear, thanks for the 30 cents.
[260:59.96]Oh, 30 cents!
[261:00.84]That's right.
[261:02.08]Justin BK, thanks for the 25 cents.
[261:03.54]Thanks for being such a great meme streamer.
[261:05.91]Well, that label's gonna... That's gonna stick now.
[261:09.13]So, it's okay.
[261:09.87]We'll let it stick.
[261:13.87]It's about three or four seagulls worth of time.
[261:16.99]I gotta start... I have to start using that denomination.
[261:21.15]I gotta be on top of that.

[262:44.94]It's a cringy, awful video.
[262:48.06]I thought I was, like, really, like, tough and, like, cool and, like, hot.
[262:53.54]Fuck.
[262:58.02]That video will never get deleted.
[262:59.75]I refuse.
[263:03.63]And that's gonna be it, everybody.
[263:06.37]Obviously nothing tomorrow.
[263:08.29]We've gone three days in a row here to make up for nothing on Thursday and Friday last week.
[263:15.19]So... Expect on... I'm not sure what's happening Thursday and Friday.
[263:22.77]I have a plan, but if the plan works or not, we'll see if that's the case.
[263:28.63]So, if anything comes up, I'll obviously let you know on Twitter, but Thursday and Friday should be a go.
