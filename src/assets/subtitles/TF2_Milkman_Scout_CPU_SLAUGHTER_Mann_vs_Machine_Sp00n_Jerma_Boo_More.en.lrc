[ve:60.16.100]

[00:11.40]Now watch me die.
[00:12.82]No.
[00:14.36]No.
[00:15.92]I'm going to do like a different tactic this time.

[00:19.91]No, no, I'm going to, I have the, the, uh, Uber Star on.
[00:26.43]I'm going to use a Uber Canteen.
[00:30.93]That was my spray before I meet the Pyro.
[00:36.45]Once that big scary wave comes, we'll see what happens.
[00:39.57]We'll see what happens.
[00:40.35]Yeah.
[00:41.75]Holy Scouts.
[00:42.85]Yeah, the big wave of soldiers is brutal.
[00:44.77]Here it is.
[00:45.19]Getting all that money.
[00:48.36]I'm Pyros.
[00:52.26]Alright.
[00:52.48]Holy shit.
[00:56.44]We need a Buff Banner.
[01:00.06]Should work.
[01:04.20]It does work pretty well.
[01:05.24]I can do that every single time.
[01:09.00]Oh, I got an achievement.
[01:11.12]Turbo charge.
[01:11.68]Yeah, you like charge everyone on the team.
[01:17.99]No!

[01:22.47]I need a dispenser.
[01:23.41]Oh my gosh.
[01:25.79]I got a new run in like two seconds.
[01:29.51]Oh.
[01:30.09]Century Buster.
[01:32.14]Don't even target the sentry buster, I'm just going to walk away from it.
[01:34.85]Oh, just kidding, because now I'm dead.
[01:37.53]This will just kill me in like one second.
[01:40.33]Everything in mine is dead.
[01:42.65]No, it's okay.
[01:45.23]What?
[01:45.57]Oh.
[01:47.25]There you go.
[01:51.47]Oh, they're going crazy.
[01:52.83]Get that money.
[01:56.03]Boon, come here.
[01:57.89]Oh my gosh.
[02:01.16]The sniper's going crazy.
[02:03.08]There's a sniper in.
[02:04.95]I got him.
[02:10.31]Oh, there's a sniper behind us.
[02:11.69]Got him.
[02:14.55]Yeah, the sniper's, like, camping everything.
[02:18.85]Alright, we gotta take out these medics.
[02:20.33]Alright, uh, team over.
[02:22.57]Coming up in two seconds.
[02:24.83]Jump down here.
[02:25.72]Freaking die.
[02:27.36]I'm extremely oom.
[02:29.38]Out of mana.
[02:32.36]If you have to explain it, it's not worth abbreviating.
[02:35.68]I'm extremely out of mana.
[02:43.34]Thank you, General.
[02:44.90]Loadout not available.
[02:46.10]Contacting items, sir.
[02:47.39]Alright, they're coming heavy right side.
[02:49.67]Need help.
[02:50.51]This is really disappointing.
[02:55.71]Bring the sentry back.
[02:57.11]Oh, they're right behind us.
[02:59.37]Boo behind us, too.
[03:00.07]Oh, what?
[03:01.73]Huh?
[03:03.57]Freaking die, you scout!
[03:07.02]I'm reloading!
[03:08.42]Can't do anything.
[03:09.12]Alright, hold on.
[03:10.78]We got this, we got this.
[03:14.59]Medic down.
[03:15.85]Nice.
[03:18.01]Good, watch out on the right.
[03:20.34]Dang it.
[03:22.00]I can't do anything when the Uber focuses me first.
[03:24.71]We're good, we're good.
[03:26.45]We're not good, my sentry's gone.
[03:28.47]Yeah, but we're at the end of the way.
[03:29.61]Yeah, but you're really good looking.
[03:36.07]No.
[03:37.23]Oh my god, please don't let me die.
[03:39.58]No.
[03:41.64]Oh no, this is not good.
[03:42.90]They got an Uber.
[03:45.46]Get in front of them.
[03:47.18]Uh...
[03:49.95]Oh shit, we lost.
[03:51.39]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:53.92]Got it.
[03:55.84]Look for money, look for money.
[03:56.76]Yeah, we definitely did not get all the money.
[03:58.22]We didn't get any of the money.
[03:59.34]Money, money, money.
[04:00.10]Yeah, but we also got a lot more money first round than I think we ever have.
[04:06.23]That's because this is like the hardest.
[04:09.61]This is really, really hard.
[04:12.59]Alright, so now like Tio, the idea is to go back to the store and spend your money.
[04:17.21]Oh, well, I have 172.
[04:17.71]There's not much I could buy with that.
[04:19.89]You could.
[04:20.25]There's stuff for 150.
[04:20.75]Wait, what?
[04:23.35]I mean, did you... Wait, no.
[04:24.79]No, no, no.
[04:25.35]You should have, like, 700-something.
[04:27.13]Oh, no, no, no.
[04:28.01]I've been... Oh, okay, yeah.
[04:28.99]I've been buying while we've been playing.
[04:30.63]I have, like... I've been buying reload speed to the fullest and, like, the firing speed.
[04:36.04]Should I not do that while we're playing?
[04:37.40]No, you can't, like... Sometimes I'll spawn and just pop something and run off.
[04:41.52]Yeah, that's what I've been doing.
[04:42.82]Yeah, that makes sense.
[04:43.48]You got the timing, yeah?
[04:44.86]Go for it, yeah?
[04:46.04]For sure?
[04:47.50]Oh shit.
[04:52.82]So where is my KD listed, hm?
[04:55.26]Uh, kill tab.
[04:56.34]I'm 125 and 14.
[04:56.54]I'm 55 and 12, I died 12 times, fuck this game.
[04:58.80]Ah ha, spoon sucks.
[05:09.63]That's not news to anybody.
[05:12.37]Alright, super soldiers.
[05:13.81]Spoons in a rage.
[05:15.49]Yeah, I will just quit.
[05:17.57]I will quit this.
[05:18.37]I will turn this car around.
[05:24.33]Oh, we got a bunch of scouts.
[05:26.13]Oh, I got two out of that?
[05:30.23]Fuck you, game.
[05:33.52]Oh my god.
[05:34.46]What the hell?
[05:36.80]Stay on the front lines.
[05:37.74]Yep, just get them from him.
[05:40.38]Open fire!
[05:41.16]Okay.
[05:45.96]Now the theory is, when they drop down here, I'm going to get an instant Uber.
[05:51.15]Oh my gosh.
[05:52.13]That's the theory.
[05:53.83]That soldier needs to die.
[05:55.79]Alright, somebody come down here.
[06:02.43]Oh, what the hell?
[06:04.38]Super soldier coming, I'm grabbing the money.
[06:09.85]Got him.
[06:10.27]See if I can do it again.
[06:11.27]Alright, super solid.
[06:14.39]Get them down.
[06:17.89]There's a medic.
[06:18.29]Watch those crits.
[06:18.69]I might have to cancel that.
[06:20.69]Oh, he got me.
[06:20.99]He got me with the crit.
[06:22.19]What the hell was that thing?
[06:24.01]Super soldier.
[06:25.67]I did a thousand damage to it.
[06:27.68]Nice.
[06:29.98]400 health, take it out.
[06:31.04]Nice.
[06:31.80]Yay.
[06:34.16]Medic, oh.
[06:35.14]Oh my god.
[06:35.46]Oh, thanks Jim.
[06:41.58]There's a lot of money down there.
[06:42.46]Super soldier.
[06:44.30]Oh, my demo knights.
[06:45.26]Jesus Christ.
[06:45.78]Whoa!
[06:46.46]You just took your head off in one swing.
[06:47.94]Sentry buster coming.
[06:48.58]Watch out.
[06:48.92]Get away from it.
[06:51.34]Nice.
[06:54.16]That sniper is aiming for me.
[06:55.66]Another sentry buster.
[07:01.50]Oh, he's coming around the corner.
[07:02.52]1,000 health.
[07:04.35]1,400.
[07:04.37]900 health, 600.
[07:04.61]400.
[07:04.67]Oh, why didn't it activate?
[07:06.87]Why didn't my uber activate?
[07:08.53]That was stupid.
[07:09.05]Oh my god, somebody harries.
[07:10.77]What the fuck?
[07:11.25]Demoknight, Demoknight.
[07:22.99]The hell, I'm out of fucking rockets.
[07:25.03]Nice.
[07:25.23]Oh my god, I walked out the door and got insta-sniped.
[07:27.61]Instantly.
[07:28.01]Really?
[07:29.57]Yeah, like, the gate opened and I died.
[07:32.68]Oh, god damn you!
[07:33.60]Who's the engineer?
[07:34.66]Selfie took the ammo just as I went on it.
[07:37.62]I have a dispenser.
[07:39.20]Oh.
[07:40.20]Hurry up with it.
[07:41.52]I need to sacrifice myse- Oh, and it would get over.
[07:45.38]Right at the perfect time.
[07:46.58]Need ammo for the shot, for the rocket.
[07:49.01]Oh wow, I can't hold up.
[07:49.95]Here they come.
[07:54.30]Ah, it's a Demoman!
[07:55.60]Get out of here!
[08:00.49]That's racist, Spoon.
[08:01.31]Are black people not allowed?
[08:02.27]Oh wow, that's freaking a lot of money that we're missing again.
[08:04.95]Oh, 21 dollars.
[08:06.83]121 bucks.
[08:07.55]You got the Machina achievement.
[08:12.07]You guys!
[08:14.47]I mean... Hey, you guys!
[08:19.71]I think I'm going to have to cancel my upload.
[08:21.57]Do it.
[08:22.31]What is it?
[08:22.63]What's it at?
[08:23.65]I've been uploading for an hour and a half.
[08:25.41]It's only 50% done.
[08:26.03]Wow.
[08:26.13]Yeah, I was having problems uploading too.
[08:30.67]Yeah, I mean, maybe it's because I uploaded earlier.
[08:32.47]Weird.
[08:36.85]I'm ready to die.
[08:38.75]This is pissing me off.
[08:40.28]This is at least the third or fourth time this month that it's happened.
[08:43.48]That it cancels a whole day of video.
[08:46.72]My bad.
[08:47.98]Let's do it.
[08:48.38]Yeah, that's...
[08:50.89]Hopefully it's fixed tomorrow.
[08:54.62]Hopefully.
[08:55.64]Charma, charma, charma!
[09:07.01]Did you guys see what was coming this round?
[09:08.29]I didn't look.
[09:09.63]Four demo nights.
[09:10.83]Super demo nights.
[09:12.45]Super demos?
[09:13.25]I don't think I've ever seen those before.
[09:17.29]I've seen the big rapid-fire ones.
[09:18.69]They're horrible.
[09:20.05]Deflector soldiers.
[09:23.31]Deflector.
[09:26.40]Ah, three rockets.
[09:27.68]Whoever has knockback right now is awesome.
[09:32.98]Can you do that on rockets?
[09:34.86]I don't know, it looks like you're kind of juggling them.
[09:36.71]He's tough.
[09:37.29]It might just be my missiles, I don't know.
[09:38.65]Oh, Super Demoknight.
[09:39.77]Nice.
[09:40.03]Oh, my Demoknight.
[09:40.73]Jesus, he's huge.
[09:42.07]I've never seen that before.
[09:43.17]How useless is he?
[09:45.89]What a cutie.
[09:46.71]That's why it sucks.
[09:49.63]Hey, turn around.
[09:50.42]Help me with the spies.
[09:51.34]Yeah, turn around, turn around.
[09:53.21]Spy shibby.
[09:54.33]There's one.
[09:56.01]It's so scary.
[09:56.89]I see spy Jerma.
[09:57.92]Another spy shibby.
[09:59.34]Spy going to spy shibby.
[10:05.76]Got him.
[10:08.00]I was going to die if I didn't.
[10:09.10]How are we doing on money?
[10:10.36]Good?
[10:13.92]Not so good.
[10:14.36]This one down there.
[10:15.82]Going, going, going.
[10:16.60]I'm lagging.
[10:19.20]I'm lagging hard.
[10:24.03]Oh my god, look at all the scouts coming.
[10:25.55]No!
[10:31.01]Sentry buster.
[10:34.91]Wow, so much death going on right there.
[10:38.37]Spy, spy, spy.
[10:41.97]Buster's coming in, buster's coming in.
[10:43.37]Spy is ass-faced, he's chasing me.
[10:44.87]Yeah, spy is me.
[10:46.55]Yep, he's dead.
[10:49.15]I'm being chased, I'm being chased.
[10:50.45]Spy is sentry buster.
[10:52.65]Oh my God.
[10:53.21]Oh, come on.
[10:54.25]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[10:55.13]I have a sentry in my hand.
[10:56.05]Can nobody kill the five spies around me?
[10:57.85]Geez.
[10:59.05]There's a Demoknight, like, nine feet tall chasing us.
[11:02.07]I'm gonna milk him.
[11:05.45]There's so many scouts in your backup.
[11:08.30]Spies, spies, spies.
[11:14.60]Oh my God.
[11:16.16]Wait, is the super demo carrying the bomb?
[11:18.78]Yeah.
[11:18.94]Oh, that's good.
[11:19.64]He needs to die right now.
[11:22.19]I'm laying into him.
[11:22.95]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:24.83]Dead.
[11:25.11]Uh, just wave of spies left to clean him out, clean him out.
[11:29.38]Everyone shoot everyone.
[11:30.18]I need ammo.
[11:32.36]All the spies are dead.
[11:34.82]Uh, one super demo left.
[11:36.02]I'm going back and getting ammo.
[11:37.14]No, wait, ammo.
[11:37.80]Don't take that.
[11:39.67]Laying into him.
[11:40.95]He's got 2,000 left.
[11:41.73]I have ammo.
[11:46.45]Nice.
[11:47.09]Yay!
[11:51.09]That's not bad.
[11:52.17]I'm looking for it.
[11:55.29]Well done, Spoon.
[12:00.69]Don't talk to me.
[12:03.91]I can't believe people are actually spectating this.
[12:09.73]I can't believe we have to spectate this.
[12:12.79]Who's spectating?
[12:14.01]Just peeps.
[12:17.67]What the F?
[12:20.03]Fanboys of the creatures.
[12:21.45]What the hell?
[12:23.47]Fanboys of the, uh, the Ubers.
[12:25.39]Or whatever our team name would be.
[12:27.13]The Ubers.
[12:27.91]Uh, we're, um, we're called, um, Ibby.
[12:33.12]Teo, did you crash?
[12:33.98]Oh, never mind.
[12:35.08]Uh, no, I died.
[12:37.30]Oh, okay.
[12:37.94]Gotcha.
[12:38.76]Hey, Spoon, doing that crazy dance.
[12:40.54]Alright, let's, uh, let's focus down that tank.
[12:42.54]Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[12:44.00]I want to shove this bottle in your butt.
[12:46.42]There's a tank?
[12:47.86]Yeah.
[12:48.18]Dude, that's a little too far.
[12:49.66]Tank!
[12:54.36]Alright, guys.
[12:55.24]I think we need to focus on the tank.
[12:57.15]Yeah.
[12:57.51]Just my thought.
[12:59.77]I think there's more damage if I just swing it a little bit.
[13:01.87]That's my idea.
[13:03.13]The needles.
[13:05.43]Heavy's coming.
[13:07.97]It's almost dead.
[13:08.70]No, it's not.
[13:10.82]I made you look.
[13:17.96]Alright, um... Need ammo.
[13:20.76]T, do you wanna hop down?
[13:21.96]Oh, Poo, you wanna hop down there?
[13:24.56]Um, not quite, but, uh... I got an Uber for you.
[13:28.84]You are invincible, man.
[13:30.60]Oh, man.
[13:30.94]I don't know how many of these guys I can kill, though.
[13:33.30]Pull back, pull back, pull back.
[13:35.48]But there's so much money.
[13:37.93]I'll get it.
[13:39.09]No, we did good.
[13:39.67]You guys, turn!
[13:40.39]Come back, we're gonna get a tank.
[13:42.93]I'll body block.
[13:48.65]Yeah, that tank is about to go down.
[13:49.95]Oh my god.
[13:50.47]That's a lot of snipers.
[13:51.67]Oh my goodness gracious.
[13:53.05]Oh my god.
[13:56.15]Hm.
[14:15.84]We got a bunch of snipers only doing 170 damage.
[14:21.80]We got this.
[14:23.12]Come on, come on, come on.
[14:25.32]Don't get crushed.
[14:27.64]Oh, we got a bunch of heavies coming.
[14:29.44]Jesus Christ.
[14:31.92]Yes!
[14:32.48]You ready?
[14:34.60]I have no ammo.
[14:37.34]It's alright.
[14:38.42]Oh, come here.
[14:39.14]Come here, Stevie.
[14:40.54]Oh, it's alright.
[14:42.79]I'll keep you alive.
[14:43.61]Oh, you would.
[14:47.78]Oh, that uber is gonna kill me.
[14:49.28]No, these safety sleepers, Jesus.
[14:50.80]No, hold on.
[14:53.32]Backstab.
[14:53.54]This is so hard.
[14:55.96]Oh, they're up top too.
[14:57.42]Crap.
[14:58.08]Sniper.
[14:58.48]Crap.
[15:01.19]Dude, that heavy looks gross.
[15:04.13]What?
[15:04.45]He's like, I hope not.
[15:06.61]Heavy, I just laid into you.
[15:11.95]Wow, there's a lot of them up there.
[15:15.94]Oh, Teo, get out there.
[15:17.97]Oh my gosh, no.
[15:20.07]No, no, no.
[15:21.69]Oh, thank goodness.
[15:22.93]They're like dropping on top of me, aren't they?
[15:24.55]Yeah, they're coming up right behind you.
[15:27.05]Really annoying.
[15:28.17]I'm going, I'm going.
[15:29.67]Those snipers are insane.
[15:33.08]It's like they have aimbot.
[15:34.28]Oh, jeez, the bomb is like right on top of me.
[15:37.20]Oh, God.
[15:38.16]Give us food, get them.
[15:40.24]I'm trying.
[15:40.76]Yeah.

[20:23.54]Why is there so much lag?
[20:26.06]I don't know.
[20:27.36]It's a European, I think.
[20:30.12]Seems to be closest to Sweden.
[20:32.52]Oh, there's so many scouts.
[20:35.02]Oh, wow.
[20:35.88]Why is that even there?
[20:36.86]Did we get the heavy?

[21:36.04]I'm not really sure people even know the value yet.
[21:38.06]I bet you.
[21:40.21]I mean, those golden ones are probably pretty rare.
[21:43.19]Yeah, like a strange golden, I think.
