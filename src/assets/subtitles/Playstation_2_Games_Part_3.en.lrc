[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.15]Wait, you guys didn't think I was gonna go live after I told you, like, three times?
[00:05.57]After I tried to, like, wind down and wean you guys off the fact that there was gonna be a stream today?
[00:11.88]Tonight?
[00:13.24]Oh, you know, I don't know.
[00:14.34]It might not happen, though.
[00:15.58]I'm, like, trying to get it ready.
[00:18.92]No.
[00:19.92]This is the first time I've ever streamed twice in one day.
[00:23.80]I'm confident that that's the case.
[00:28.24]I was live at like noon today.
[00:30.96]For like an hour or two, doing the E3 conference.
[00:35.20]And then, here we are now.
[00:37.08]About to play some PlayStation 2.
[00:43.27]Uh, there are four new emotes.
[00:44.49]I'm sure you've seen them already.
[00:51.47]What is that?
[00:52.53]That's Jex!
[00:53.21]That's Trevor Jex!
[00:55.81]It's the hand with the little finger gun and the smoke coming off, like... Look at how good he just did.
[01:00.53]And it's shaped like a J, too.
[01:05.59]Alright, what do we got?
[01:06.69]We got a lot of random things over here.
[01:08.38]This is not going to be very long.
[01:10.84]Probably only going to stream for a couple hours, maybe.
[01:14.10]Just hang out, chill.
[01:16.82]Turn the night down.
[01:19.72]You gotta pay $9.99 a month for a beer.
[01:23.10]Or $24.99 for a picture I did in MS Paint.
[01:28.53]Yeah, Jerma Mercury's here.
[01:33.85]The smoke can only get seen in dark mode.
[01:35.65]Well, then that's an extra special part of the emote for people that get to do night mode.
[01:40.33]Alright, I'm just gonna grab one.
[01:49.40]Okay, this one is called Made Man, Confessions of the Family Blood.
[01:53.77]I don't know, it's going to be like a Godfather simulator or something.
[02:01.91]Let's check it out.
[02:06.45]Head over here.
[02:08.29]And hey, look at that.
[02:09.11]There's a PlayStation there.
[02:11.00]A PlayStation 2.
[02:12.96]Hopefully it's queued up right.
[02:13.93]Oh, ready?
[02:14.45]Let's do a test.
[02:18.31]Ready?
[02:19.59]Was it good?
[02:20.73]Good.
[02:22.17]Let me know if it was off.
[02:36.56]Better twitch.tv doesn't work on your browser.
[02:38.29]This is blurry and it's not just on your screen.
[02:44.32]That's blurry for all of us.
[02:46.86]Oh boy.
[02:47.34]Oh man, this is ugly.
[02:54.80]Okay, hold on.
[02:55.38]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:57.98]Let me just open up my stream lab.
[03:01.56]I haven't even done that yet.
[03:05.77]This is what happens when you try to upscale a game that's 240p into 1080p.
[03:09.79]Which just don't work.
[03:12.13]Or 720p, for that matter.
[03:13.33]He's a made man.
[03:17.48]That's a bit of a mess.
[03:26.02]Like, dashboard... Okay.
[03:27.72]I never even played this game.
[03:36.45]This game was not two cents.
[03:38.65]It was more than that.
[03:39.37]Okay, we're good.
[03:50.03]Made Man.
[03:50.49]Is this based on a TV show?
[03:53.72]I feel like this is a TV show game.
[03:56.32]Half of PlayStation 2's arsenal of video games were fucking PlayStation 2 games.
[04:02.32]What?
[04:03.50]You okay, Joey?
[04:06.60]Look, this is a very big day for me.
[04:13.58]Philly called.
[04:15.38]By the end of the day, I'm either going to be a made man or I'm going to be dead.
[04:20.73]So what do you have to do?
[04:21.59]Do I drink that?
[04:22.11]Do I grab the car?
[04:22.91]It's about money.
[04:25.81]This time it's gold, but it's always about fucking money.
[04:29.40]Look, you really sure you want to know what this is all about?
[04:32.04]Crash.
[04:32.50]And then we're going to get chased.
[04:34.10]Alright, listen.
[04:35.64]When we got back from Nam, eggs said... Eyes on the road.
[04:37.83]Eyes on the road.
[04:38.57]Jesus.
[04:39.13]Johnny eggs, right?
[04:40.29]I heard him.
[04:40.91]Johnny eggs beyond them.
[04:41.95]Anyway, listen.
[04:43.41]Jared Leto's Joker.
[04:44.59]I know.
[04:45.15]It was terrible.
[04:46.93]Suicide Squad was one of the worst movies ever.
[04:48.47]Hey, do you hear that they're doing a Joker-Jared Leto movie?
[04:51.96]Doesn't that piss you off?
[04:52.88]Little Italy.
[04:54.14]That's where I first met Philly Lombardi.
[04:56.93]Hey, so you're Joey.
[04:58.33]I want to thank you for looking after my boy.
[05:01.67]That's not the voice that would come out of that guy's mouth.
[05:03.85]So I understand you're looking for work.
[05:05.97]Look, I got a little business in North Carolina you can take care of for me.
[05:08.35]This guy just inhaled sodium hexafluoride.
[05:12.47]That's a guy having an orc voice.
[05:14.05]What most monsters do on a day-to-day basis to earn is mundane.
[05:17.09]Like buying cigarettes cheaply in North Carolina and reselling them in New York.
[05:21.15]Without collecting any tax, of course.
[05:23.96]That's a Jerma voice.
[05:26.54]I mean, it could have been.
[05:28.72]North Carolina, June 7th, 1971.
[05:30.01]Is this discount mafia?
[05:40.69]We'll find out.
[05:43.84]What can I get you, handsome?
[05:45.86]Coffee and a smile, sweetheart.
[05:47.86]Both of those things.
[05:49.36]And no particular order.
[05:50.36]This guy had an orc voice too.
[05:51.32]Look around with that right analog stick.
[06:17.14]The service in here sucks.
[06:19.02]I didn't put Tabasco on my eggs like I asked!
[06:22.07]A little service around here would be nice.
[06:25.77]Elmar, you wait your turn like everybody else.
[06:29.46]Jesus.
[06:32.16]I only want coffee.
[06:44.16]Don't eat him, man.
[06:45.44]Don't give this place a three on Yelp.
[06:47.62]Okay, Benny, I've just about had enough.
[06:53.92]Come on, get out of here.
[06:54.90]Benny, ain't that your brother's messing with that truck?
[06:58.40]Oh, I thought they were kicking me out.
[06:59.58]I thought they were kicking me out.
[07:02.35]And don't you go getting any ideas either, partner.
[07:06.13]I got you down.
[07:06.87]Put that thing down, Benny.
[07:08.17]I don't know what to say about you, Dory.
[07:10.05]I thought you were throwing it out.
[07:18.81]I can't move.
[07:19.83]Who am I really shooting?
[07:22.57]Walk to them.
[07:23.82]Collect the weapons and ammo by walking to them.
[07:25.76]Alright, I got one.
[07:27.02]R1 to fire guns.
[07:32.16]Alright, you can't do that.
[07:37.40]Alright, hide behind the counter.
[07:41.51]This is just from the movie.
[07:42.81]This is no lip syncing.
[07:44.59]Game's too loud?
[07:45.11]Alright, I'll turn the game down.
[07:45.91]I was gonna be a maid man!
[08:07.65]Alright, lock the door.
[08:08.58]There's pills.
[08:09.14]I can't really leave.
[08:09.82]There's a sneak.
[08:10.20]Okay, that's how you aim.
[08:10.88]Do I have limited ammo?
[08:36.64]Alright, what am I supposed to do?
[08:40.24]Use square to reload your weapon.
[08:41.28]Change weapon using directional button up and down.
[08:43.10]Oh, okay.
[08:47.80]What are you aiming at?
[08:49.86]What's he aiming at?
[08:51.89]I'll do it too.
[08:53.07]I'm shadowing this guy.
[09:01.61]Let's touch guns.
[09:02.57]Let's do the Goku thing that he does with Vegeta.
[09:07.04]He didn't like that.
[09:07.68]Okay, I guess I'm just gonna go.
[09:13.52]No, it's a cover shooter.
[09:14.88]Don't even... Yeah, it's a cover shooter.
[09:19.85]I didn't shoot that guy.
[09:21.21]I don't know how that guy died.
[09:22.15]I have absolutely no idea.
[09:24.65]Well...
[09:38.91]Why'd you do that?
[09:40.57]Let's do the same thing except it's me this time.
[09:47.71]See, now I did it to you.
[09:50.94]How do you like it?
[09:53.76]Sucks to be old, don't it?
[09:54.82]Alright, I like this game.
[09:57.80]I'm playing this one for like the next 16 straight hours.
[10:01.32]What?
[10:01.48]What are you doing?
[10:09.80]Why was he doing that?
[10:10.60]What?
[10:10.74]I don't understand.
[10:13.42]These are bad guys.
[10:16.32]Open doors using circle.
[10:24.11]How do I put this away?
[10:24.79]Alright, here.
[10:25.45]Okay, I can't do anything about that.
[10:30.65]So we're just going to put the gun back up.
[10:35.83]What game is this?
[10:36.37]This is Made Man for the PlayStation 2.
[10:41.23]Moving while crouched makes no noise.
[10:43.13]To toggle in and out, it's L2.
[10:44.77]Yeah.
[10:48.83]So, sneak around.
[10:49.59]Is there a stealth kill?
[10:53.74]Where are they?
[11:11.41]Does anybody know where they're coming from?
[11:12.41]I don't know where they are.
[11:15.19]Should I just open the door?
[11:18.45]I was sneaking.
[11:19.29]How would they see me through here?
[11:23.56]Oh, he's right there.
[11:24.58]Okay.
[11:25.88]He's hiding behind the glass.
[11:30.20]Not a smart place to hide.
[11:32.14]Can I break the windows?
[11:33.96]Yeah, I can.
[11:39.30]That's good.
[11:39.86]Alright, where is he?
[11:43.00]Don't know.
[11:43.34]We're going to go this way.
[11:49.51]Melee attack using circle.
[11:51.21]Yeah, we just tried it.
[11:52.15]This is what I was asking.
[11:55.25]Can you do a stealth kill?
[11:58.11]I mean, kind of.
[11:59.56]You just Donkey Kong the back of the back and they die.
[12:02.46]That's good.
[12:07.93]Okay, I can do two shootings.
[12:10.35]Two shootings, yeah.
[12:12.03]Can you tell I'm tired?
[12:14.43]I can do two-shoot gun.
[12:17.35]One in each hand.
[12:18.38]Back of their back.
[12:19.02]Yeah, you just shoot him in the back.
[12:20.72]How do I shoot both?
[12:22.42]Can I... R1 is the same thing?
[12:38.02]Alright, let's speedrun this.
[12:40.44]It's not that hard.
[12:41.40]I missed.
[12:41.78]Whoops.
[12:59.57]Imagine this guy was doing this.
[13:05.83]While running around shooting at you.
[13:08.03]You know, it was hard for me to figure out how to use a gun.
[13:11.81]But I've been using guns since I was two years old.
[13:14.01]That's the weird thing about guns.
[13:15.89]When you pick them up and you put them in your hand.
[13:17.45]They make all kinds of weird fucking noises as you pull the trigger.
[13:20.87]It's weird though.
[13:21.33]When I was 14, I got arrested for the first time.
[13:24.44]Getting arrested sucks, I'll tell you.
[13:26.84]There's nothing fun about that.
[13:32.05]What does it say about triangle So I've been around stuff all I've been around fucked up stuff my whole life, you know I stole the Reese's behind the fucking counter
[13:56.02]Mods fix the game.
[13:57.16]What do you mean?
[13:58.52]Oh, I thought you were telling me to go download mods to fix the game How am I gonna do that?
[14:03.47]Got his hat too
[14:22.76]What the fuck do you want, buddy?
[14:23.66]I just couldn't fucking understand.
[14:25.18]Can I aim?
[14:25.62]Well... It's not that easy to aim in this game.
[14:28.41]Considering it's like... It's not easy.
[14:52.77]You see, touching the controller just goes... I think it's the uncensored patch.
[15:03.01]That just scared the shit out of me.
[15:04.25]I was like, what the fuck is that?
[15:06.58]Okay, sniper rifle?
[15:12.86]I can only hold the sniper rifle.
[15:17.87]How am I supposed to use this?
[15:20.87]The thing is, I picked up a sniper rifle, but I had no fucking idea how to look down the scope.
[15:24.90]When I was 14, I was trying to figure this out.
[15:28.54]I just absolutely couldn't fucking... Oh, there it is.
[15:30.42]I'll have to hold on to it.
[15:36.69]There's no more bullets in the sniper rifle, so I put it back down.
[15:40.37]No, no, no.
[15:40.81]I need this, right?
[15:49.74]Can I get ammo for it?
[15:52.26]I don't think I can.
[15:52.92]There's a guy up here that needs to die.
[15:58.54]That's Jerma Mercury.
[15:59.21]What do you mean, what the hell is that?
[16:04.11]I'm gonna try to drop a car on me.
[16:17.94]Oh, do you think I'm stupid?
[16:19.34]Where's he gonna put me?
[16:38.52]I graduated first grade, I thought I was stupid.
[16:47.14]Never mind.
[16:57.02]I was 14 when I had a car drop off me.
[16:59.12]Oh, no.
[16:59.72]How far away is this?
[17:00.34]Alright, I'm just... We're just going.
[17:01.36]Those guys ran into each other.
[17:15.01]They're just three stooges to death.
[17:16.33]I didn't do anything.
[17:17.01]Alright, let's get the sniper rifle.
[17:18.09]I'm not gonna fucking around.
[17:18.73]Let's go.
[17:19.05]Keep going.
[17:26.88]That's for using a controller.
[17:28.50]That's for using a controller!
[17:31.18]Playing a shooting game!
[17:34.86]You deserve this!
[17:35.95]Thought that was a guy.
[17:43.37]It's not.
[17:43.81]Alright.
[17:49.42]Alright, do it.
[17:52.03]Shoot the guy operating the crane and then I'm gonna drop it on somebody else.
[17:57.81]That's a very long sentence of dialog that didn't really need to be said.
[17:59.55]He just said everything.
[18:00.21]All information.
[18:16.96]Okay, we're good.
[18:19.30]We're safe.
[18:23.56]Oh, I was trying to get a collateral.
[18:34.23]Okay, I don't have any guns left.
[18:36.71]Yeah, I do.
[18:36.99]I got this one.
[18:37.79]Nice shot.
[18:48.94]Hold to retort.
[18:49.76]Did I just shoot myself?
[18:57.18]What happened?
[19:01.21]I don't even know who I shot there.
[19:02.35]That guy's clearly not dead.
[19:05.09]Did I miss?
[19:11.45]I may have missed.
[19:14.29]I think I accidentally killed my co-op partner.
[19:22.08]What noise is that from?
[19:24.64]Oh, what is that?
[19:28.40]It's in so much stuff.
[19:29.52]I just don't know.
[19:30.06]This guy goes on to be the Bastion narrator.
[19:53.04]Uh, I'm afraid Merv didn't make it all the time.
[19:56.29]He's dead?
[19:56.63]Oh, fuck.
[19:58.25]Weasel Walt and his boys have gone too far this time.
[20:01.05]You know where I can find this guy?
[20:03.61]Yeah, but I got a more pressing problem, boy.
[20:05.83]While we stand here getting acquainted, Walt's boys are busy raiding my store.
[20:09.28]Is that a mannequin or is that two guys?
[20:10.20]I ain't as young as I used to be, and sure could use a hand here.
[20:14.42]Well, I figured it.
[20:16.62]I'm gonna read the back of this box, because this looks a lot more interesting.
[20:21.78]Where is it?
[20:22.86]Uh, it didn't even come in a box.
[20:24.94]It came in a single disk.
[20:26.26]Alright, I shot that guy's head off, but it was actually a mansion.
[20:36.99]Alright, I understand.
[20:49.10]Oh god!
[20:56.58]Shoot over the counter, not the wall!
[20:58.35]I almost died.
[21:06.11]Oh, I found a body armor.
[21:10.71]Alright, don't let old Ned die.
[21:19.59]That was a one, two, three headshot.
[21:21.33]Did you see that?
[21:21.91]That's supposed to be a cigarette.
[21:24.45]Yeah, you're just smoking a cigarette.
[21:26.67]Made man.
[21:26.89]Oddly enough, I haven't stopped playing this yet.
[21:50.55]I'm not entirely sure why that is.
[21:52.11]This guy has a machine gun.
[21:54.25]Oh my fucking god.
[22:12.59]There we go.
[22:13.15]You just have to strafe around.
[22:14.15]That's the only thing you can do.
[22:16.29]Why is Jack smoking?
[22:16.83]That's a finger gun, and the gun is smoking because he's doing so well.
[22:19.07]Is that already here?
[22:41.09]What is it, the mouse?
[22:42.31]Get the cheese?
[22:42.87]I gotta get the cheese, alright.
[22:45.47]Alright, I got the cheese.
[22:50.68]Oh, fuck.
[23:11.76]God damn it, man.
[23:12.54]Give me a break.
[23:15.58]Is Jax naked?
[23:17.53]He doesn't have to be, but he might be.
[23:19.87]Maybe in your reality.
[23:23.33]Next?
[23:24.67]Well, it has been like 30 minutes.
[23:26.23]You're right.
[23:26.77]And if this is only going to be like a couple hour stream, then I better get to the next one.
[23:36.10]When I reached the gun store, there was no one around, and since I wasn't planning on doing this, I killed everybody else.
[23:41.79]And then I opened up the door, and I... I'm here, boy.
[23:44.71]There was this fucking old guy, and he pointed... Alright.
[23:46.65]That was alright.
[23:47.03]That was pretty fun.
[24:12.18]Get it in there quick.
[24:16.22]From one to the other.
[24:19.00]That's what I have to say.
[24:24.89]New game.
[24:26.79]This is a new game.
[24:30.99]That's right.
[24:42.30]I like to call this one, uh... Wait for it, you'll see.
[25:02.57]Oh, Maid Van 2!
[25:06.69]A.K.A.
[25:10.02]I was gonna say The Garfield.
[25:11.74]Godfather, limited edition.
[25:16.20]Two, like, Italian mob stories, back to back.
[25:29.41]Yeah, E3 just is going on right now.
[25:31.35]These are all the new PlayStation 3 games.
[25:33.05]PlayStation 2 games, sorry.
[25:35.05]From 2005.
[25:39.31]Have you not played this?
[25:40.11]I've never played this, no.
[25:46.61]Someday, and that day may never come, I may call upon you to do a service for me.
[25:55.26]Until that day, accept this as a gift.
[26:00.26]Doesn't matter how many times you hear this.
[26:02.92]This is now somebody doing a joke voice.
[26:04.42]Always.
[26:08.47]You're doing that for us, Don Corleone.
[26:11.90]You're making a reference.
[26:13.42]You're being a funny guy.
[26:14.52]This is a Saturday Night Live skit starting here.
[26:17.42]Don Corleone, how are you?
[26:18.78]Why so bright?
[26:22.45]Here's a week's take.
[26:23.73]Nice.
[26:25.05]Good week, huh?
[26:26.33]Yeah, some high rollers.
[26:28.55]I'm gonna celebrate tonight, taking Serafina to the Continental Club.
[26:40.72]Hey, baby.
[26:44.53]That literally sounds like you.
[26:46.97]He's been playing handball in the alley all day.
[26:48.61]I thought the noise was going to drive me nuts.
[26:50.47]It's just that it's like a Joker voice.
[26:53.35]Good.
[26:54.13]What the hell was that?
[26:57.27]Is this how the movie started?
[27:03.63]Oh, my God.
[27:05.19]My boy.
[27:06.03]Oh, Christ.
[27:12.44]Oh shit!
[27:13.44]It's the Riddler's Henchmen!
[27:17.06]I've never seen this movie.
[27:18.22]I've never seen the movie.
[27:20.62]I've never seen any of these movies.
[27:23.94]Hold L1.
[27:27.05]It's an analog stick fighting game?
[27:30.61]Oh my lord.
[27:32.71]It is.
[27:33.03]He like, walks around.
[27:34.39]Can I dodge?
[27:47.36]Alright, I got the bat.
[27:54.59]You have to queue it up.
[27:58.82]Where did I end up?
[27:59.72]Why are we fighting in a fire?
[28:12.75]Watch the movies first.
[28:14.11]Alright, we're gonna put the movie on screen, half the screen, and see if we can play through the movie and the game and get the same plot points at the same time.
[28:22.47]Give it to him.
[28:32.67]You think you killed me?
[28:34.97]I have like 40 points in HP.
[28:40.51]Look at all the guns all over the ground.
[28:41.59]Why are there so many guns?
[28:42.51]There's bazookas and shit.
[28:43.61]Look at bazooka, handguns, machine guns, pipes.
[28:57.88]Papa?
[28:59.48]Look away.
[28:59.98]It's good.
[29:01.79]You know who I am.
[29:06.65]How are you doing?
[29:10.58]I'm all grown up now.
[29:12.16]Wait, you make a character?
[29:40.47]Character creation.
[29:42.09]Sweet.
[29:44.33]Alright, maybe a little bit of shiny forehead.
[29:46.83]Forehead intensity.
[29:47.73]Looks alright.
[29:51.96]Forehead mole?
[29:53.34]Sure.
[29:55.30]Let's get two balls.
[29:57.66]So we can look like a bug, like a spider.
[29:59.44]You know the spider has his eyes up?
[30:02.76]And all that shit that you see in the spider's face is not... Those are our eyes.
[30:05.76]The stuff that you see with the eyebrows, that's not our eyes.
[30:10.75]Let's get like zits all over us.
[30:16.04]Let's get a little more pale here.
[30:19.60]That's alright.
[30:21.30]Can I do hair?
[30:26.22]I can't tell... Hold on.
[30:28.00]Let's randomize.
[30:28.70]Alright, this is clearly just the same guy...
[30:40.24]From different stages of life.
[30:41.52]This is me when I gained 40 pounds.
[30:45.88]This is me when I got back from Malibu.
[30:51.41]What's the difference?
[30:54.43]We're gonna go with this one.
[30:59.11]Anything else?
[31:00.13]Min?
[31:00.41]Max?
[31:04.85]We'll go with that.
[31:05.65]That's fine.
[31:06.52]Whatever.
[31:07.94]Into the tailor shop.
[31:10.41]Alright, shirt and coat combos.
[31:18.58]I'm gonna make myself look like a real fucking idiot real quick here.
[31:22.30]Come on, I want that.
[31:25.68]2100 bucks.
[31:25.98]I don't have any money.
[31:31.71]I'm making myself a Sims character.
[31:33.19]Alright, let's go back.
[31:34.79]Vests.
[31:35.15]We're gonna go... I can't.
[31:37.27]I don't have any money to buy these.
[31:41.15]Zero dollars.
[31:42.27]Sport coats?
[31:46.05]We're gonna just go with this.
[31:47.03]Pants.
[31:52.84]Alright, now I'm a farmer.
[31:53.98]I'm like, go get the cattle while you're out there!
[32:03.45]No hat.
[32:05.67]No glasses.
[32:10.56]Alright, visit the barber.
[32:11.44]This is what I want.
[32:12.16]Face and head.
[32:13.66]Hair.
[32:18.43]Again, these are all the same thing.
[32:19.81]Alright, let's just go bald.
[32:22.17]Wait, hair length.
[32:29.66]Can I have like a big long ponytail?
[32:31.24]How do you have longer hair if you're bald?
[32:35.54]You just don't.
[32:35.94]Okay.
[32:36.22]Okay.
[32:42.66]Let's go with, uh, sideburns.
[32:45.96]Can I go no eyebrows?
[32:51.63]I'll go with villain.
[33:01.34]No, no, no.
[33:07.48]I think he looks the stupidest like this.
[33:09.10]Yeah, he does.
[33:11.82]No facial hair.
[33:13.66]What are the family secrets?
[33:19.10]It's just a really... It's a family secret.
[33:24.90]More ads.
[33:26.02]Every licensed video game had DVD ads on it.
[33:29.61]Every one.
[33:30.03]I spent my life protecting my family!
[33:37.47]Okay, what about this one?
[33:41.55]How do I have these unlocked?
[33:44.17]Film archive.
[33:45.93]Movie 1 out of 25.
[33:47.36]Wait, do you unlock piece by piece the whole movie?
[33:59.61]That's so funny.
[34:02.13]It's a condensed version.
[34:06.43]Join the family.
[34:07.57]Enter name.
[34:08.47]Aldo.
[34:08.73]No, no, no, no.
[34:12.88]It's not the whole movie?
[34:14.60]Well, close enough.
[34:18.44]I think I have a decent name here.
[34:21.76]How about Greco?
[34:26.22]No.
[34:27.12]Not Jex.
[34:27.76]Jex does not belong in this game.

[36:33.52]That's Tim Italian.
[36:38.42]What- how do I do this?
[36:41.96]Oh, there we go.
[36:42.32]I'm not going- worst name so far.
[36:55.89]We're only gonna play this for like 30 minutes.
[36:57.37]Who cares?
[37:01.36]We spent more time doing that than I probably will do in this game.
[37:06.50]It's Tim the Italian.
[37:11.06]Hi, welcome to the wedding.
[37:14.20]You know the drill.
[37:15.90]You've seen this fucking movie 50 times.
[37:18.94]On this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
[37:22.07]You're the favorite I want to give to you, of course.
[37:24.39]Everybody knows this fucking scene.
[37:25.99]Godfather?
[37:33.00]My husband was always loyal to you.
[37:34.60]Yes, yes, he was, yes.
[37:36.70]He died for that loyalty.
[37:41.87]I'm not going to fall for it.
[37:46.57]I have not forgotten him, nor the loss that you have suffered.
[37:51.51]Have you ever wanted for anything?
[37:54.15]Haven't I always taken good care of you?
[37:57.05]Padrino, forgive me.
[37:59.10]Goddammit, he didn't say anything.
[38:32.11]And I hope that their first child be a masculine child.
[38:37.91]Thank you, Luca.
[38:39.23]My most valued friend.
[38:41.19]Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you now because I know that you are... Thank you.
[38:49.37]One more thing, my friend.
[38:51.05]I need you to do something for me.
[38:57.26]I need to do more scenes of this.
[38:58.26]Stop.
[38:58.48]I forgot we made this guy.
[39:28.43]Get up.
[39:28.99]I gotta get you back to your own universe.
[39:32.57]You definitely don't belong in this one.
[39:39.72]I jumped out of a time portal.
[39:41.08]You do.
[39:41.82]You just stay right there.
[39:43.68]You're gonna help me teach the kid how to look after me.
[39:47.14]You got it.
[39:48.62]Now, let's see what you got.
[39:50.40]Locked on move.
[39:52.17]Just do what he says.
[39:55.66]While locked on move, the right analytics are down, then up.
[39:58.50]For a power move.
[40:00.20]That's a grab.
[40:06.55]Nice moves.
[40:09.53]Alright, now what?
[40:15.01]Grab him again.
[40:17.05]Bring him to his feet.
[40:29.27]Oh, alright.
[40:34.11]Get up!
[40:35.27]Get- This is actually kind of fun.
[40:39.80]He just hit him on the other knee.
[40:41.96]He went off one knee and bounced off the other one.
[40:44.80]Who needs power moves when you got speed?
[40:54.53]So, kid, you and me, we got some business.
[40:59.55]Come take a walk.
[41:00.19]This game's actually really good.
[41:04.58]I mean, it seems like it's pretty fun.
[41:05.98]We're gonna get real close, see?
[41:10.74]Talk in front of anyone.
[41:11.94]You'll need a map.
[41:13.34]Help you find your way around.
[41:15.44]Together with your notepad, you'll be able to find all the hardest spots in town.
[41:21.39]I still forget where the hell I am from time to time.
[41:25.13]Okay, a mini-map.
[41:26.42]Use a mini-map to help you navigate to objectives, job locations, or businesses.
[41:30.38]Use a mark to your safe house.
[41:32.12]See the map in the pause menu.
[41:33.08]You got a mission objective or a safe house?
[41:36.54]Get to the Corleone safe house.
[41:39.67]So this is a GTA game?
[41:41.77]Can I steal cars?
[41:47.47]What are you going to do?
[41:48.35]Stop me?
[41:50.14]Wow!
[41:51.90]Oh my god, you can actually drive cars!
[41:53.32]How do I get out?
[42:01.17]Well, it looks like you can't get caught.
[42:09.53]Alright.
[42:10.75]That's fine, though.
[42:13.91]Can you get hit by cars?
[42:21.60]Yes.
[42:22.53]Yes, you can.
[42:23.57]What is this guy doing?
[42:27.39]This guy's just driving over people.
[42:29.91]He's erratic.
[42:31.85]He's doing the thing with like a little kid when he's standing there pushing the car back and forth with his knees on the ground.
[42:39.32]Leaving the mission area.
[42:40.46]Am I?
[42:40.92]Alright.
[42:41.70]Give me a car.
[42:48.33]How do I drive?
[42:50.13]Plus 50 heat.
[42:50.68]Okay, now how do you drive the car?
[42:52.06]Okay, it's X. That's odd.
[42:56.00]Alright, that turned... Car's turning off.
[42:58.20]They turned on the diamond.
[43:04.76]Okay, that... I don't care what anybody says.
[43:06.90]That was scary.
[43:08.32]That was very scary.
[43:10.90]They were trying to hurt me.
[43:18.68]This is my own house.
[43:19.32]Who has a gun?
[43:20.52]Running from somebody with a gun?
[43:22.50]Okay, this is the safe house.
[43:26.30]Deirdre Bannon.
[43:53.03]shot in the fucking head.
[43:55.21]Why did you... Why would they do that?
[44:00.49]Those cops?
[44:05.74]Jesus Christ.
[44:09.54]Head upstairs to your safe house.
[44:15.81]Welcome to your...
[44:20.97]I just grabbed her shirt and let her go and somebody shot her.
[44:27.31]Guilty by association.
[44:29.55]Safe houses allow you to save your game progress and they can be used as hideouts from the police.
[44:33.11]Go upstairs and save the game.
[44:42.22]I did not know this game was this elaborate.
[44:56.55]Mafia, become human.
[45:01.78]Save successfully.
[45:03.82]You've earned a new respect level and have gained health and skill points.
[45:07.40]Go to the skill screen in the pause menu to upgrade your attributes.
[45:10.36]Okay.
[45:13.61]Got 500 bucks, 500 respect, and I unlocked part one of the Godfather.
[45:18.47]Answer the telephone downstairs.
[45:21.69]Let's go to the pause menu here.
[45:25.32]Fighting, shooting, speed, street smarts.
[45:32.26]How many points?
[45:33.30]Would I have one point right now?
[45:34.56]Fighting.
[45:34.88]Increases grab time.
[45:38.78]Negotiation pressure.
[45:39.93]Increase aiming speed.
[45:42.31]More health.
[45:43.89]Sprint duration.
[45:50.79]Speed?
[45:52.97]Should I just run everywhere?
[45:58.48]Okay, well that's all I got.
[45:59.37]Alright, let's go.
[46:03.53]Answer the phone downstairs.
[46:11.26]Can I answer any ringing phone?
[46:15.64]Can I just pick up random phones on the street?
[46:18.16]Alright, meet with Luca outside.
[46:24.53]Walking into a blue halo will start the next Corleone mission.
[46:28.86]Why not?
[46:38.27]You ever do a funny voice?
[46:39.57]Hey kid.
[46:40.21]Let's take a walk.
[46:44.83]I don't know any funny voices, I'm sorry.
[46:47.87]It's less crowded now.
[46:49.79]I like that.
[46:51.38]Makes it easier for a man to get his business done.
[46:56.95]I make good money.
[46:57.83]I help the family.
[46:59.53]I get a little action on the side.
[47:02.91]But one thing must be understood.
[47:06.05]I would never go against the Godfather.
[47:14.38]Don Corleone is a man I respect.
[47:21.89]What are the sideburns?
[47:26.16]They're painted on.
[47:28.98]Looks like.
[47:32.26]I'll go rough somebody up.
[47:41.24]What game has my attention or got my attention?
[47:43.91]I mean, I'm looking forward to Dreams.
[47:45.67]Spider-Man.
[47:48.65]Battletoads.
[47:49.77]Cuphead DLC.
[47:51.86]cyberpunk and hitman 2 probably I'd say uh alright I want you to have a word with emilio convince him to pay his dues to the call he owns think you know what to do sort of how should I handle it
[48:07.07]Oh, yeah, the FromSoftware stuff, too.
[48:08.57]We didn't really get a good look at it, though.
[48:10.73]We just kind of got, like, a trailer.
[48:13.99]I want to see more of actual what the game is.
[48:16.61]Alright.
[48:16.87]Extort the Butcher.
[48:37.97]I think I can do that.
[48:42.19]Let's extort the butcher.
[48:50.29]No, I can't fit in there.
[48:51.27]I was gonna try to drive in.
[48:54.17]Some people have a pressure meter that appears below their health bar.
[48:56.87]When the meter is filled past the green, that person fears you enough to do what you ask.
[49:02.72]Threaten or use violence.
[49:05.44]When the pressure meter turns red, you've pushed a person too far.
[49:09.09]You won't get anything from them, and you can expect them to fight back hard.
[49:13.91]Okay.
[49:15.55]So... Cast?
[49:20.62]Register?
[49:23.02]Just open up the register.
[49:28.81]What are you doing up back here?
[49:30.09]We're close.
[49:35.27]Alright, pressure.
[49:38.94]Extort him.
[49:46.46]Destroy property or attack Emilio until the pressure meter shows that he'll give in and press that button to extort him.
[49:54.71]Okay.
[49:56.91]Alright, how about... What about this way?
[50:01.27]You just got this finished, didn't you?
[50:08.11]No, come on.
[50:09.89]Alright, I gotta extort, extort.
[50:17.55]No!
[50:18.05]Get him!
[50:22.45]I was trying to get as much money as I could.
[50:24.15]I didn't think it was gonna fill the whole meter up.
[50:26.45]Remember me?
[50:40.01]Oh, yeah?
[50:45.89]How does this sound, buddy?
[50:49.53]Weak spot bonus.
[50:50.35]Yeah, he really likes that scale.
[50:51.95]He likes his money, too.
[50:55.20]Oh, yeah?
[50:57.02]You should eat shit.
[51:02.32]Alright.
[51:03.66]Payout.
[51:04.00]Go, go, go.
[51:07.04]Come on.
[51:07.26]A little bit more.
[51:07.82]A little bit more.
[51:09.50]Get to like 1400.
[51:09.88]You've extorted a merchant.
[51:12.00]The owner will now pay protection money to the Corleone family each week if you can keep him alive and his business intact.
[51:33.23]Weak spot bonus plus weekly income.
[51:34.85]Keep him alive.
[51:36.77]Some businesses are fronts for illegal activity.
[51:39.23]Rackets.
[51:40.05]Once you've extorted a merchant, the door to the back room becomes unlocked.
[51:43.98]Keep your eyes open for doors leading to back rooms.
[51:47.98]Back door unlocked.
[51:49.04]So you forcibly take over a business and then run it into the ground until the old business never exists anymore and disappears forever.
[52:05.57]Sounds a lot like Microsoft at this E3 conference.
[52:10.85]The last five years.
[52:13.87]Relevant humor.
[52:15.57]Relevant humor.
[52:17.93]New racket.
[52:23.99]So what's the deal?
[52:25.77]Welcome to the casino.
[52:30.43]Can I play?
[52:31.87]Don't tell me.
[52:32.43]I can play casino games here?
[52:33.92]Can I?
[52:38.75]Taking up rackets.
[52:39.41]Talk to the racket boss first when you want to control his operation.
[52:43.25]If he respects you and a buyout is offered, it will guarantee maximum long-term profits.
[52:47.52]If not, you need to turn up the pressure to convince him.
[52:50.26]That was gonna have to hit his head on the piano.
[53:07.47]Took it over.
[53:08.07]As it earns money, you'll automatically get a cut of the profits.
[53:10.88]800 bucks.
[53:14.40]Business takeover.
[53:18.74]Can I play craps?
[53:19.46]Alright.
[53:22.47]Well, that's interesting.
[53:23.31]Firm handshake.
[53:24.29]Let's go.
[53:24.65]I didn't have to hurt anybody.
[53:26.29]Alright.
[53:26.73]Is that it?
[53:40.74]Is he breaking the safe?
[53:45.29]I don't think he can break the safe.
[53:47.75]I'm strong, but not that strong.
[53:51.59]Alright, let's go back downstairs.
[53:59.56]Need dynamite?
[54:01.48]That's cool that you can even do that, though.
[54:03.26]Bribe the police sergeant!
[54:08.59]If you punch a safe, your health should go down.
[54:11.11]That's true.
[54:11.45]A cop on your payroll helps get the heat off your back for a little while, at least for small crimes.
[54:16.09]The green bribe meter indicates how long the police will look the other way.
[54:39.85]That's... How come I never played this game?
[54:44.05]This seems really good.
[54:52.82]Yeah, I extorted the guy, then extorted the business that was running under that guy, and then extorted the cops that were coming to put pressure on the extorted business that was under extortion.
[55:04.44]Interesting.
[55:11.06]Alright, a thousand bucks.
[55:13.77]Part two of the movie unlocked.
[55:17.19]Alright, meet this guy at the nightclub.
[55:19.47]Okay, I want to, like, just check out some stuff.
[55:23.11]Let's just... Let's go this way.
[55:32.30]That was very bright.
[55:33.10]Alright, what else can I do?
[55:38.52]Is it your safe house periodically saved?
[55:40.04]Okay, there's no auto-save.
[55:42.81]So, I am going to save it right now.
[55:44.61]This is the safe house, right?
[55:53.81]Up to bed.
[55:54.27]This is my house, right?
[56:00.12]Oh, a bat.
[56:01.56]Nice.
[56:04.10]I don't think this is my house.
[56:06.14]But, whatever.
[56:06.72]Let's save it regardless.
[56:12.42]What the fuck is going on?
[56:15.08]What was that?
[56:16.26]Why did that happen?
[56:22.12]Did I press, like, spacebar?
[56:25.04]I think I pressed a button with my controller accidentally.
[56:32.07]That wasn't a joke, I accidentally pressed a button on my keyboard that changed scene.
[56:43.99]How long was that on there for?
[56:45.53]It couldn't have been that long.
[56:48.31]It has not been 20 minutes, more like 30 seconds.
[56:59.66]I can't believe how long I did that for.
[57:06.08]It was not more than a minute.
[57:10.49]Alright, back in the vehicle, let's go!
[57:20.74]What's reverse?
[57:22.22]Okay, square is reverse.
[57:24.50]That's camera.
[57:31.75]Mobsters wearing black jackets are Corleone allies.
[57:34.66]Okay.
[57:34.78]That's good to know.
[57:50.66]The stream is worse than Sony's press conference.
[57:53.63]What?
[57:57.46]What are you on about?
[58:04.88]You should play The Godfather 2.
[58:05.52]I'm looking for Paulie Gatto.
[58:06.72]Luca.
[58:07.80]Luca sends his love.
[58:08.96]Were these on PC or only PlayStation 2 and what, PS3?
[58:12.48]Hey, take a joke, why don't you?
[58:14.20]Take it easy, take it easy.
[58:16.26]Look, Luca told us about you.
[58:18.18]He's just busting your balls, Paulie.
[58:21.07]Right, Paulie?
[58:21.93]Thinks he's a comedian.
[58:22.83]Meet Marty Malone.
[58:23.93]He ain't a pretty sight, but- My friends call me Monk.
[58:27.09]Pleased to meet you.
[58:28.15]Likewise.
[58:28.63]Okay, okay, this ain't no tea party.
[58:30.29]My friends call me Paul.
[58:30.85]Got work to do.
[58:31.97]Now follow me.
[58:32.87]It's right around the corner.
[58:37.02]Yeah, Baldy McCracken.
[58:38.00]Reservoir dog.
[59:06.40]The eyebrows look like they're drawn onto the underside of my brow.
[59:13.24]Yeah, I shaved him off and got eyebrow tattoos.
[59:20.46]I tattooed all my makeup on.
[59:21.88]Permanently.
[59:22.30]Beat up the college punks?
[59:24.76]What's the sprint button?
[59:37.07]Just hit him again.
[59:43.59]You guys go get the other one.
[59:44.33]I'll take care of this guy.
[59:45.11]I'll take care of Archie Bunker.
[59:46.49]You go get Jughead.
[59:47.61]I wonder what was left of his bones here.
[60:04.74]He's dead.
[60:05.12]I killed that guy.
[60:06.10]What are we supposed to kill?
[60:07.74]Are we supposed to kill them?
[60:09.07]Can I hit his head on this thing?
[60:11.07]Why does this guy have a head made of titanium?
[60:35.97]Oh, you can actually throw him around.
[60:41.55]You whip him around, you let go.
[60:42.63]That's great.
[60:42.99]He's turning into Manhunt.
[60:58.89]Hold on, did I call that guy Archie Bunker?
[61:00.98]That's wrong.
[61:01.48]Archie Bunker was that fat guy.
[61:03.94]With the wife that sounded like Elmo.
[61:05.84]Right?
[61:06.08]Fifteen hundred bucks.
[61:07.60]Got it.
[61:31.19]It's important to upgrade your attributes in the skills screen now.
[61:41.38]Only speed.
[61:45.06]All speed.
[61:45.68]You think it's a joke?
[61:52.50]Alright, let's talk.
[61:53.18]Meet Luca at the Bowery in Little Italy.
[61:56.39]That sprint.
[61:56.97]Okay, there we go.
[61:57.87]That was like a your teeth all broke.
[62:23.89]I'm running too fast.
[62:24.95]The car's not even moving.
[62:27.11]I haven't saved the game.
[62:28.19]So just... I know that's very... I think it's very funny.
[62:32.67]But I can't do that again.
[62:35.47]I cannot stone cold start on myself on somebody's car anymore.
[62:43.49]Okay, let's go this way.
[62:50.21]I'm going too fast.
[62:51.33]That's not my problem.
[62:52.29]It's the game's problem.
[63:02.83]Next if I die?
[63:03.63]No, I'm not gonna die.
[63:04.99]Learn how to shoot.
[63:10.83]I was thinking maybe I could run into the wall and smash my face on it.
[63:15.27]I would have gone into orbit if that happened.
[63:17.37]If I could fucking just like toddler ran into the wall.
[63:25.89]This ain't no weapon like from your army boy days, but it'll do the job.
[63:31.18]Next, if you die, you guys want me to move on from this one?
[63:35.82]I'm having a good time in this game.
[63:37.58]Scars away curious people.
[63:40.00]Can't be traced, neither.
[63:43.32]Give that dummy a few slugs to the chest.
[63:46.22]Lock on, press L1.
[63:48.90]Press R1.
[63:53.43]What if your target's wearing vest?
[63:55.11]Then you gotta aim for an arm or leg.
[63:56.85]See?
[63:57.03]Learn fast, kid.
[63:57.45]Okay, tough guy.
[64:24.21]Approach and face the wall and take cover.
[64:26.33]Shoot while L1 and press R1.
[64:31.97]Yep.
[64:35.29]Locked on.
[64:35.77]Release then quickly press and hold L1 again when... Fire when switched.
[64:42.34]Okay.
[64:44.46]Step away from the wall.
[64:46.56]Free aim.
[65:04.29]I'm telling you right now, the number one thing not to yell out the window if you hear gunfire next to your building is shut the fuck up.
[65:11.64]Because, uh... This person probably ain't that stable.
[65:21.24]Reload is up.
[65:25.79]And that's concealed weapon.
[65:30.07]Shut the fuck up.
[65:35.22]It's not like kids playing basketball and bouncing off your wall.
[65:38.80]It's like a guy shooting a truck with a gun.
[65:41.30]This game is legit.
[65:42.28]Feels like it.
[65:55.21]Let's do it.
[65:58.03]I need health.
[65:59.03]Gas.
[65:59.39]Brake.
[65:59.75]Handbrake is circle.
[66:02.39]That's what I was looking for.
[66:12.44]What's a nitro?
[66:14.98]Why am I having a Marlon Brando fever creep right now?
[66:23.51]Drugs did you give me, Tony?
[66:24.69]Oh!
[66:24.81]I'm fine.
[66:31.39]Don Corleone, I am honored to be asked to carry out this task for you.
[66:37.16]I will not fail.
[66:38.80]Thank you, Don Corleone.
[66:40.46]Drive, drive, drive, drive.
[66:46.64]Police running.
[66:48.86]Didn't I pay somebody a hundred bucks to make sure I never could get caught for a crime ever again?
[66:55.12]That $100 is supposed to keep me safe, even if I run people over.
[67:09.19]Damn it.
[67:13.09]I headbutted that lady.
[67:19.25]Here we go.
[67:20.13]We're at the meeting.
[67:20.73]It's only minor crimes.
[67:30.03]Yeah, I know.
[67:30.39]I'm just being a dick.
[67:30.87]There's an alley over there where you can keep an eye on the meeting.
[67:34.48]If anything happens, get out of there fast and find Mark.
[67:40.20]Get out of the fast and find mom.
[67:43.88]Mom will come bail us out.
[67:46.90]He's dead.
[68:08.65]They let you smoke one cigarette.
[68:11.49]And then they kill you.
[68:13.00]Yep.
[68:21.80]Oh, they just showed him the Microsoft E3 press conference.
[68:25.36]He can't believe it.
[68:29.55]Oh shit, I'm not supposed to be here.
[68:30.89]This is a private E3 event.
[68:32.19]Fuck.
[68:33.95]I gotta get out of here.
[68:37.34]Oh no, I'm not allowed.
[68:38.32]I didn't buy a ticket in time.
[68:43.97]Right here.
[68:46.79]We gotta go.
[68:49.21]What?
[68:51.87]Okay, um.
[68:56.09]That's a good one.
[68:58.53]Oh no, oh no, that's not good.
[69:00.21]Okay, I'm fine.
[69:05.12]I forgot everything they just told me.
[69:07.60]There we go.
[69:08.12]It's up.
[69:08.44]This guy right here.
[69:15.97]This is the dude.
[69:22.21]There he is.
[69:26.39]Ooh.
[69:27.27]Smoked him out there.
[69:28.31]Let's do it.
[69:42.22]Oh!
[69:43.78]Shoot it!
[69:44.32]Shoot the gun!
[69:45.64]Shoot the gun!
[69:46.20]That was actually awesome, but I kind of blew it.
[69:54.18]Alright, stop sprinting around.
[69:55.24]Reload.
[70:16.70]Kneecap.
[70:17.30]That's it.
[70:20.04]Alright, let's go.
[70:20.84]Reload it.
[70:21.24]Anybody that way?
[70:27.43]Doesn't look like it.
[70:28.95]I don't want to get shot and die right here.
[70:33.13]Five dollars.
[70:33.79]Whoa!
[70:35.19]Fuck.
[70:47.23]They're gonna shoot me.
[70:53.62]Get out of here.
[71:11.10]I win!
[71:12.97]Get to your safe house in Little Italy.
[71:14.81]That guy's naked!
[71:17.65]No, he's not.
[71:21.15]Picked up some cash.
[71:21.97]Okay, I can leave it here, right?
[71:34.36]Put the gun down.
[71:35.90]Oh, I forgot I had a gun.
[71:37.44]What is this thing?
[71:39.28]What do I have in my hands?
[71:40.16]Put that away, too.
[71:45.05]No, I don't have a bat out.
[71:46.03]I'm just taking different weapons out.
[71:48.59]Put all the weapons down!
[71:49.99]Oh my god!
[71:51.83]How do I put the weapon down?
[71:53.72]Hey, I got this weapon too, and I got this one.
[72:04.56]If you've seen this weapon, I also own this.
[72:11.27]Gonna lose the cops here.
[72:14.45]I was pressing down on the deep end.
[72:17.09]I was changing weapons.
[72:19.03]Don't you dare.
[72:26.92]Don't drive this close to me when you're on fire, you dick!
[72:33.92]Fine.
[72:39.52]That was sneaky right there, right through the middle.
[72:51.12]come on big turn move lady is this mafia uh this is the godfather what get out of the car get out of the car
[73:18.91]Stop, stop, stop.
[73:20.19]Get out now.
[73:20.83]Get out, get out, get out.
[73:22.19]Get out.
[73:28.75]I can still make it.
[73:29.76]44 seconds.
[73:30.14]I'm almost there.
[73:35.36]This is just the movies again.
[73:36.64]Did I miss?
[73:39.65]I think I missed my turn.
[73:42.45]No, I didn't.
[73:43.21]It's right here, right here.
[73:51.14]Move out of the way.
[73:58.26]Get out of the car!
[74:06.14]I'm fine.
[74:22.23]I turned into a fucking chimpanzee for a second.
[74:25.47]Sorry.
[74:26.43]You guys just got a trip to the zoo.
[74:28.95]2,000 bucks.
[74:29.21]3,500 respect.
[74:29.43]We're good.
[74:51.74]So I leveled up.
[74:53.34]Save the game now.
[74:58.50]Let's upgrade our skills.
[75:02.38]Got one, two points.
[75:04.39]This is more weapon reloading and reveal and conceal.
[75:08.15]And this is sprint duration.
[75:12.69]I need more health.
[75:13.67]I can't just do all speed, can I?
[75:16.68]That would be a bad idea.
[75:20.88]Movement speed.
[75:24.44]Shooting.
[75:24.88]Increasing aiming speed.
[75:26.02]Like, I'm going to be so useless, guys.
[75:30.58]Those of you that think it's funny that I only put points in speed, I mean, yeah.
[75:35.63]Laugh out loud.
[75:37.15]But I'm going to be worthless.
[75:42.61]At least, like, a point into shooting.
[75:46.27]Precision aiming.
[75:47.71]Disarm chance.
[75:51.60]Fighting.
[75:52.06]I mean, these are all important.
[75:56.76]Negotiate.
[75:57.40]No, we're going to put... I'm doing street smarts.
[75:59.42]I'll be really fast.
[76:00.30]I'll be a really fast talker and really fast physically.
[76:05.59]That's good.
[76:08.49]We get minus 10% heat and vendetta earned.
[76:12.09]We get plus 3 seconds breaking point revealed.
[76:14.99]We need these.
[76:16.73]Carry limit.
[76:17.93]There's dynamite in this game.
[76:23.42]These are the weapons, okay.
[76:28.08]Garote wire.
[76:29.02]Alright, save again.
[76:33.14]This game's fun, I like this game.
[76:39.33]The whole run is fucked now?
[76:41.59]How so?
[76:46.89]Starting to plan ahead.
[76:57.15]I mean, I only planned on streaming for like a couple hours tonight.
[77:00.74]This was... Because if you didn't know, streamed earlier today.
[77:07.08]Streamed tonight.
[77:08.50]And then streaming at midnight.
[77:10.59]Three streams in one day.
[77:13.47]No, I'm kidding.
[77:14.25]That's a lie.
[77:17.41]I think I want to keep playing this game.
[77:21.96]I don't think I want to stop playing this.
[77:25.12]This seems to be a lot of random little mini-games.
[77:26.84]I want to buy stuff.
[77:28.21]I want to buy some new clothes and... I want to buy a car.
[77:32.47]What, is running fast considered a crime now?
[77:55.96]Alright, so now what's an objective?
[77:59.66]I'll just move around?
[78:04.50]What's this guy?
[78:04.96]Okay, here's a shop.
[78:08.50]Hello.
[78:08.74]Alright, let me in.
[78:10.34]Let me in.
[78:19.29]Ooh, extortion.
[78:19.95]Okay.
[78:20.61]What's going on?
[78:21.23]What are you doing here?
[78:21.93]What's with the blue guys?
[78:55.50]Oh my God.
[78:57.06]Okay, I just executed that guy.
[79:00.54]Oh my God.
[79:03.41]Okay, alright.
[79:04.23]Are you gonna pay?
[79:05.73]Good.
[79:05.97]Let's see what you got in here, dickhead.
[79:12.49]A table.
[79:15.31]You like this table, don't you?
[79:16.45]Your wife gave this table to you, didn't she?
[79:26.07]I can't hit his head.
[79:30.87]God damn it.
[80:06.37]Well, I got confused.
[80:09.41]I got all fucking confused because like two guys came in to fight me and I didn't know what the hell was going on.
[80:14.14]Did I lose this forever?
[80:18.36]I didn't lose this forever, did I?
[80:19.40]So I'm gonna be back there tomorrow.
[80:21.84]How do I go road?
[80:38.31]No, I'm trying to garrote.
[80:41.06]I just want to test it on somebody.
[80:48.12]How do I garrote the guy?
[80:50.76]I don't understand how this works.
[81:01.67]I mean, I have this.
[81:03.77]Baseball bat?
[81:04.75]I don't understand.
[81:10.23]Because that takes it out, and then this switches.
[81:11.61]Somebody call the cops!
[81:16.43]Baseball bat.
[81:17.27]Okay.
[81:19.25]Wait, it's out.
[81:20.90]Is there just some random dude back here I can test this on?
[81:27.22]You have to take it out.
[81:28.82]I thought I had it selected.
[81:29.62]Alright, what's my gross income?
[81:34.50]Bracket establishment, $1,800.
[81:36.26]Total income, Corleone tribute, 70%.
[81:41.83]Why do I have to pay that much money to the Corleones?
[81:45.17]I'm gonna be a net loss soon enough.
[81:46.83]Okay, I have it out.
[81:52.60]I'll do whatever you say!
[82:01.42]You lunatic!
[82:02.54]Alright, you win!
[82:04.62]Probably have to be behind them.
[82:07.82]Pardon me.
[82:15.42]I have it out.
[82:17.24]I just don't understand how it works.
[82:18.77]It's currently out right now.
[82:24.51]Oh, there we go.
[82:25.01]Okay, let him go.
[82:27.81]He's fine.
[82:29.57]You have to be sneaky.
[82:30.43]You can't just wrap it around the neck.
[82:33.86]Alright, new business right here.
[82:35.32]I'm not going to fuck this up.
[82:40.66]There are a lot of people in here, though.
[82:43.44]You don't need to check on me.
[82:46.38]The Corleones will get their share.
[82:47.96]Do I already own this place?
[82:55.59]I really am hit, man.
[82:56.51]I have the ball head and everything.
[82:57.85]Alright, let's go.
[82:58.63]What do I need to do?
[83:01.53]Do I have a mission?
[83:04.95]This is huge.
[83:09.09]Okay, we're getting targeted there.
[83:13.25]Let's go... Let's go down here.
[83:17.85]To the weapon shop.
[83:21.05]Right there.
[83:28.50]Go get the phone?
[83:35.22]Where's the phone?
[83:42.57]I can hear it.
[83:43.19]Where's the phone?
[83:47.47]I'm in the guy's house now.
[83:49.89]He's having to study.
[83:50.89]I don't know where his phone is.
[83:51.85]Yeah, I didn't think I got a secret fucking movie.
[84:12.03]Can't see?
[84:12.59]Uh, yeah.
[84:13.77]It's hard to see, actually.
[84:14.91]This is a PlayStation 2 game pulling in through a fucking machine.
[84:18.23]Shh.
[84:33.67]It's Monk.
[84:34.29]Told you not to talk about this on the phone.
[84:37.59]Just meet me at the barbershop in Little Italy.
[84:42.91]Okay, so that's the phone.
[84:45.61]That was the phone I had to pick up.
[84:48.31]Good.
[84:49.15]Where's my car?
[84:57.23]I still have a cough from like three months ago.
[84:59.49]Isn't that annoying?
[85:01.27]I hate that so much.
[85:10.68]I gave her a lot of warnings.
[85:13.96]Too many, one would say.
[85:15.18]Oh, a car.
[85:16.34]Wow.
[85:16.74]Next mission.
[85:17.78]Do I get a haircut now?
[85:36.70]What kind of tea have I been drinking?
[85:38.70]Lemon ginger.
[85:40.18]That's my new favorite.
[85:43.10]If you guys are playing a drinking game right now, is take a shot every time you hear that little ditty.
[86:00.29]That single bagpipe.
[86:03.72]He'd be dead in minutes.
[86:28.81]He just woke me up.
[86:29.35]I was sleeping?
[86:31.11]Wait, this is too far into the movie.
[86:35.84]I know how this happens.
[86:36.58]He gets, like, shot here.
[86:37.28]I remember this scene from the movie!
[86:39.68]Hold on, I know this scene from the movie!
[86:42.54]He's got a bag of donuts and stuff and they shoot him in the chest and he goes up in the car and... Oh no!
[86:55.57]Holy shit, this is fast forwarding.
[86:59.88]I'm the Don now.
[87:00.66]It's my Corleone at this point.
[87:01.80]Protect Frankie from the assassins.
[87:04.34]Sure thing.
[87:05.62]Let's do it.
[87:38.67]I'm going for the speed thing.
[87:41.03]Everyone points into speed.
[87:42.51]God damn, I can't.
[87:54.33]It's not possible.
[87:55.37]It'll never be possible.
[87:56.61]I'm sorry, guys.
[87:57.61]I can't.
[87:57.97]Get out there and do that.
[87:58.69]We're gonna have to shoot them.
[87:59.55]Alright, watch out.
[88:07.01]Keep Frankie alive.
[88:09.41]Here we go.
[88:26.11]I think I just shot Frankie.
[88:27.89]I did.
[88:28.55]Yeah, I did.
[88:29.41]I shot her.
[88:31.75]Okay.
[89:00.61]That was an execution.
[89:07.49]He was holding her.
[89:08.61]What did I came up with?
[89:09.61]Executed her.
[89:10.15]Alright, no more funny stuff.
[89:13.75]No more funny games.
[89:19.22]Can I shoot him?
[89:21.54]Why am I holding this at the hip?
[89:22.90]Can I aim the gun?
[89:24.85]Why am I holding this like a two-year-old?
[89:27.37]Pow!
[89:27.59]I don't know.
[89:34.13]Was that a bad guy?
[89:35.97]That's it, right?
[89:40.27]Okay, and then this guy.
[89:43.31]I gotta get it right.
[89:43.91]Right in the head.
[89:49.15]Did I?
[89:49.59]Okay, that didn't shoot her.
[89:50.59]Good.
[89:57.17]It's just some guy.
[89:59.91]Run.
[90:00.47]Run away.
[90:00.99]Why are you walking around the streets?
[90:05.06]You're Frankie, right?
[90:06.04]Monk's sister.
[90:06.96]Yeah, why?
[90:08.04]He's been shot.
[90:09.08]Oh, God.
[90:10.26]What happened?
[90:11.28]It was a hit.
[90:12.30]I think the Don is dead.
[90:17.71]Hey, you gotta help me get my pup to the hospital.
[90:20.41]Get in.
[90:20.75]We'll follow the ambulance.
[90:29.87]Why is she not getting in the car?
[90:32.17]Shouldn't she be getting in here?
[90:35.55]To Dawn's health.
[90:38.61]Okay.
[90:41.85]You gotta go quick.
[90:42.89]Where is this again?
[90:46.03]Oh, he's inside that.
[90:47.73]He's in like the hearse ambulance.
[90:49.83]Is that the ambulance?
[90:53.11]Okay, that's the ambulance.
[90:53.96]Alright, I'm just making sure I'm following the right thing.
[91:01.03]I can't shoot here.
[91:01.95]I have to just drive.
[91:02.69]I have no say in this.
[91:10.00]Do I have cargo faster?
[91:11.44]This guy's taking the most roundabout way to the hospital.
[91:20.22]He could have just drove in a straight line.
[91:22.58]He's working.
[91:24.08]Shit.
[91:32.49]Here.
[91:33.31]Don't lose him.
[91:37.01]Watch out, lady.
[91:40.79]Music's pretty good.
[91:44.77]Back in, like, 2001 or 2006, this game was pretty great.
[91:51.50]No.
[91:52.68]No!
[91:56.84]It's good because this game doesn't have the fire infection like every other game does.
[92:03.76]If a car touches you on fire in any open-world driving game, you also get the fire infection.
[92:08.40]This game doesn't have it.
[92:11.42]And it can spread forever.
[92:12.20]I hope I didn't find it.
[92:31.22]What, did fucking Lakitu pick you up and put you over here?
[92:40.69]Oh, interrogate the capo and find out who ordered the... Come here.
[92:53.45]That's not the right guy.
[93:00.52]I just... I just karate jumped.
[93:12.85]Okay.
[93:16.41]Alright, it's this guy.
[93:19.99]It's any of them.
[93:21.31]It don't matter.
[93:21.93]It doesn't matter who it is.
[93:36.92]Give me the fucking gun.
[93:38.00]I'm shooting two of them.
[93:39.92]Alright, make sure you interrogate the guy.
[93:58.42]One last dick.
[94:07.62]Alright, I gotta put this down.
[94:13.65]What do you know?
[94:16.49]What's going on here?
[94:17.99]Tell me.
[94:19.03]I'm scared of you.
[94:22.88]Not scared of me, huh?
[94:24.74]Well, let's see how you're scared of this.
[94:30.34]Scared of this?
[94:31.92]Stop.
[94:33.45]I got information.
[94:39.11]He's gonna die!
[94:40.95]He's already dead.
[94:43.28]Okay.
[94:43.46]So, what is that?
[94:44.04]What do I do now?
[94:44.54]This game is... I love this game.
[95:09.86]I couldn't kill him.
[95:10.44]Drive the ambulance to the hospital.
[95:12.00]It's on the north side of Little Italy, near East Houston Street.
[95:20.77]But you wouldn't try to get out of the way.
[95:25.13]I could.
[95:26.01]I did.
[95:26.35]I killed him.
[95:26.79]He's dead.
[95:29.27]Step on it.
[95:29.97]We gotta find the hospital.
[95:34.40]The Don's gonna die.
[95:35.32]Doesn't he just... He just dies anyways.
[95:36.78]Keep going.
[95:38.06]Keep going and hurry!
[95:40.00]This is one of those things, if I get into car accidents, then the dawn dies if I get into too many accidents.
[95:52.26]Hold on, Tom.
[95:54.48]Hold on.
[95:54.88]Almost there.
[95:55.66]You're gonna make it.
[95:58.86]You're gonna make it.
[95:59.88]Alright.
[96:01.59]So we get to change the history here.
[96:03.70]The movie, he dies.
[96:04.68]But in this version, I got there with like 10% health.
[96:08.68]So he gets to stay alive in this movie.
[96:09.72]Let's get some help over here.
[96:17.27]Hey, Fred.
[96:17.77]What the hell happened?
[96:19.35]Sonny, Sonny, I... Pop, god damn it.
[96:25.75]Back away, back away.
[96:31.22]What's this guy watching a movie?
[96:32.52]Get him out of here.
[96:35.45]That was good.
[96:37.29]Get your ass over here.
[96:38.33]So is this a situation where I'm playing as the invisible guy in the movie?
[96:43.23]Don't mind, sonny.
[96:44.66]It's just that... Like, I don't even exist in the movie, but they can put me here.
[96:49.82]And it doesn't matter.
[96:50.64]I can be the character that just is invisible.
[96:52.16]Your dad said something about Salazzo and your consigliere.
[96:55.63]Consigliere?
[96:57.46]Tom, what else did he say, kid?
[96:59.60]This is important.
[97:00.30]Yeah, so this is not a character that he's ever... This guy's not an important character anywhere.
[97:04.02]Christ.
[97:05.57]I hope Tom is okay.
[97:07.37]He's not the fighting type.
[97:09.63]We'll take it from here, kid.
[97:12.41]Head on over to the compound.
[97:18.57]Nearly a 50 year old movie and people are complaining about spoilers.
[97:25.47]And honest to God, what you are describing is as if you would get upset about opening up your textbook and reading about the Spanish Inquisition.
[97:36.47]No, I don't know.
[97:37.11]That's a spoiler for something that happened.
[97:39.25]I don't want to read that.
[97:43.75]Ah, see, I don't think so.
[97:44.89]I don't think I want to hear about this.
[97:49.53]World War I?
[97:51.02]No, don't read that out loud, teacher.
[97:52.40]That's a spoiler.
[97:58.64]I haven't seen the movie that somebody made.
[98:01.06]I didn't see Marching on the Battlefield.
[98:04.93]What's that famous movie?
[98:05.87]This belongs to me now.
[98:20.23]Jesus dies and comes back.
[98:30.17]That's like being mad about knowing the end of a Charlie Chaplin movie.
[98:36.35]Wait, hold on a second.
[98:36.97]He does a funny thing and he twirls an umbrella around?
[98:41.03]And the lady, like, throws a drink in his face?
[98:43.85]How dare you tell me that?
[98:45.77]It's only been a hundred years since that piece of... I'm going the wrong way.
[99:03.68]Spoiling history.
[99:05.96]Oh, level up.
[99:09.03]Got some level ups here.
[99:09.87]Hold on.
[99:21.88]Rival business.
[99:29.76]This guy's in red shirts.
[99:32.28]Don't think the peace will last forever, kid.
[99:35.04]Yeah.
[99:36.06]So there's blue coats, red coats, yellow coats, green coats.
[99:41.12]What color of the rainbow are we?
[99:45.34]I should probably just start picking people up now, right?
[99:50.62]New venue.
[99:53.18]Show some respect, or I might get mad.
[99:56.06]Notifying you next to Ken, Mac?
[99:59.13]Alright, here we go.
[100:00.01]These guys are not happy about me.
[100:04.27]You, look.
[100:05.55]Yep.
[100:05.77]Extort.
[100:06.25]I don't think I can extort this lady.
[100:16.66]Let's pick somebody's gun up off the table.
[100:21.97]Alright, excuse me.
[100:24.01]Yeah, yeah, everybody's thirsty.
[100:29.44]If you couldn't tell, they don't like you.
[100:34.34]I guess there's nobody to extort.
[100:40.18]Nope.
[100:41.62]This is a point of interest, though.
[100:48.31]Phone.
[100:50.47]I hear a phone that I have to pick up.
[100:57.27]Where's that goddamn phone?
[101:00.79]Is it out here?
[101:01.31]I have to pick up the phone.
[101:09.40]Oh!
[101:12.06]How about letting me poke around inside for a bit?
[101:14.22]Yeah, whatever, Mac.
[101:15.58]This job don't pay that well.
[101:17.41]Get inside.
[101:21.61]There it is.
[101:25.69]It's Tom.
[101:26.91]Come over to the compound.
[101:28.93]We want to talk about your future.
[101:31.36]Okay, I got another place to go.
[101:32.90]Oh, no, that's the same.
[101:33.93]They just call every business and hope that I'm there.
[101:35.93]What are we talking about here?
[101:44.55]Okay, nothing.
[101:50.36]Anybody know where the kid is?
[101:51.78]Nah, nah.
[101:52.34]Just call every single business in all of New York City.
[101:57.15]He might be in one of those and he's a weirdo.
[101:58.69]He picks up the phone no matter where he is.
[102:00.49]He's fucked up.
[102:01.67]He's a really fucking weird guy.
[102:07.28]I just was doing a little shimmy.
[102:10.16]Is she singing?
[102:10.86]Interesting.
[102:11.54]Okay.
[102:11.82]Well...
[102:28.04]What do I got?
[102:28.56]I got my gun, right?
[102:30.55]Give her a second.
[102:33.89]Nah, I'm gonna go... Pot shot, pot shot.
[102:38.93]Shot put, and then a shot put over there.
[102:41.41]And I'm gonna grab this guy.
[102:46.89]Fuck over here.
[102:58.61]Yeah, there's only one name in this town.
[103:01.21]It's called Leon's.
[103:02.61]Oh, really?
[103:02.99]Mmm, not gonna pay a thing, are ya?
[103:04.05]What if I do this?
[103:35.77]Don't execute him don't execute him.
[103:38.77]You don't want to get me angry Break all this stuff I want to smash it smash the smash this thing.
[104:00.97]I want your cooperation.
[104:02.43]Ah
[104:05.95]Break his stuff.
[104:08.75]No, I don't want to hit him.
[104:09.89]I don't want to kill this guy.
[104:10.90]I just want to break stuff.
[104:11.80]Oh my fucking god.
[104:13.88]Can I scare him?
[104:26.56]I got it.
[104:26.96]I got it.
[104:27.38]I got it.
[104:27.72]I don't...
[104:30.50]I can't, like... I have to be, like, locked onto something to swing.
[104:35.11]I'm holding L1.
[104:35.77]It doesn't seem to do anything.
[104:39.91]Holding L1 and then using the right stick just seems to not... I don't... It's weird.
[104:44.99]Alright, he's paying.
[104:48.74]He's paying.
[104:49.14]He's paying.
[104:49.96]He's almost dead, too.
[104:50.92]I gotta do something drastic in front of him.
[105:07.64]Is that enough?
[105:08.04]You're going to pay more money?
[105:11.52]Where's the money?
[105:15.22]I could have gotten more.
[105:18.23]I need to get this down because it's strange.
[105:27.49]You have it in your hand, so right stick doesn't do anything.
[105:29.51]Holding down L1 is supposed to get you ready to swing.
[105:33.93]It doesn't do anything.
[105:37.20]You have to be locked on to somebody to swing.
[105:46.32]And you have to be close enough with a bat.
[105:48.71]What about just with your hands?
[105:51.73]Just put this away.
[106:02.69]No.
[106:05.24]L2?
[106:05.38]No, it's not doing anything.
[106:08.89]I think you have to... Certain things can be broken.
[106:12.45]I just don't think you can just throw around your hands for no reason.
[106:16.65]Is this the back... Try the free aim with the bat?
[106:21.96]That's a good idea.
[106:22.54]Let's try that.
[106:25.68]Free aim.
[106:28.64]No.
[106:29.08]I think it just has to be designated stuff like this.
[106:37.73]Yeah, only items in the indicator.
[106:39.03]Okay.
[106:40.59]Well, I was flailing around like a moron, so... Let's go!
[106:45.75]Put it away.
[106:56.36]You need dynamite?
[106:57.00]Yeah, I'm just... Whoa, that's a shotgun.
[107:00.26]Cool.
[107:00.68]Okay.
[107:07.59]on the phone alright get me out of here I spent enough time in here let's go to the mission when did I make the face that I that was used for Jerma um I don't know that's a good question
[107:38.57]Blordow made these last four emotes, so... I just gave him the guidelines of what I was looking for, and he just kind of went to town.
[107:50.32]Oh, fuck.
[107:53.25]Go back to maid, man!
[107:54.41]No!
[107:55.93]Let's run around in a circle.
[107:57.99]Wait, let me look at the map.
[108:02.79]Alright, so it looks like...
[108:06.29]Just gotta take a left out of here, and then... Left.
[108:09.53]Left.
[108:10.27]Left.
[108:14.13]God, get out of the way.
[108:18.25]There's no painted lines on the road, that's why it's so hard.
[108:20.97]They didn't add painted lines until like the 50s.
[108:24.01]This is the 50s.
[108:24.59]They didn't add painted lines until the 80s.
[108:26.11]I'm gonna explode.
[108:39.52]Don't tell me to take a right.
[108:40.44]It's, you know, it's a left, left, left.
[108:57.17]At the back of the day when GPS was not a thing.
[108:59.31]That's right.
[109:03.05]Stop driving against the other cars.
[109:04.61]Or what?
[109:04.99]It's the fastest route to get to Don Corleone's house.
[109:19.58]It's the music.
[109:20.20]That's where it ends.
[109:21.44]It's the end of the movie.
[109:23.42]He gets in a fucking brutal car accident with a parked car.
[109:26.30]Hey, tough guy.
[109:35.00]Hey, what do you got for me?
[109:36.58]I'm going to miss Luca Brasi.
[109:38.92]I want to be just like him.
[109:40.86]I remember one time he killed one of our own guys just for giving the Corleones a bad name.
[109:45.96]You're not going to give the Corleones a bad name, are you?
[109:52.24]I don't think so.
[109:54.11]I'm going to try not to be.
[109:55.15]Pick one, man.
[109:55.47]You're a little up and down about this.
[109:57.27]Alright, let's go to the... Let's go to the... I think I got those upgrades.
[110:22.69]Right over here.
[110:28.21]Nope, that's Mom.
[110:35.96]Nope, Mama Corleone has plot armor.
[110:39.22]She can't be killed.
[110:41.60]That's too bad.
[110:43.35]Can't even be targeted.
[110:44.57]Mom Corleone, unkillable.
[110:46.45]Need to make sure we have ultra-thick plot armor for her.
[111:00.69]Let me speak plainly.
[111:02.65]The Corleone family has need of men like you because as we speak, our enemies encircle us, waiting to prey on any sign of weakness.
[111:11.75]What can I do for the family?
[111:14.34]We would like to offer you a role as an unofficial enforcer for the family.
[111:20.42]See that we maintain control in the streets and help us to regain our true balance.
[111:25.22]In time,
[111:26.63]you will become a trusted associate to our family.
[111:29.32]And then, God willing, you will become one of our made men.
[111:33.68]Except the title of the last game.
[111:36.40]Let's go buy some clothes.
[111:38.69]I want to look even more ridiculous.
[111:44.73]Promotion to Enforcer.
[111:45.67]Okay.
[111:47.58]Okay.
[111:51.40]One point.
[111:52.10]I gotta pee.
[111:52.68]I'll be right back.
[111:54.32]Let's do a point in health.
[111:57.69]Alright, I gotta pee.
[112:00.45]I'll be right back.
[112:01.63]We're probably not going to stream for that much longer just because I really only was going to go for a couple hours tonight.
[112:07.41]I've got some stuff to do tomorrow morning that I need to get to sleep for, but I'll be back.
[112:11.97]We'll stream for like another hour or so.
[115:07.20]Hi there.
[115:08.78]So I'm about to do this thing, and I'm really gonna probably make somebody sick here.
[115:11.98]I'm really gonna piss somebody off, but it's, you know, it's just me, and this is, that's what you get right now, you know what I'm saying?
[115:20.49]So, uh, one of my favorite snacks, sort of a weird thing that I do, I take, uh, peanut butter, a jar of, it's gotta be Jif creamy peanut butter, don't get any of the other shit.
[115:34.27]I know this is the... GIF is the Coca-Cola of peanut butter.
[115:38.85]I understand that.
[115:40.57]GIF, creamy peanut butter.
[115:42.87]And same size.
[115:45.25]They gotta be the same size.
[115:47.29]Equal parts marshmallow fluff.
[115:50.77]GIF, fluff.
[115:53.29]Open them up.
[115:54.95]Open up the peanut butter first.
[115:56.97]Get rid of... Don't fuck the bread.
[115:58.57]What's the bread for?
[116:00.91]open up the little jar of peanut butter fluff and what you do take a spoon slide a little bit of peanut butter right into the mouth go into the fluff about maybe like 30 of what you just took in peanut butter into the mouth it's my one of my favorite things in the world clock clock
[116:31.95]That's the best sandwich yet, but it takes time to spread it.
[116:35.00]It gets all messy.
[116:36.70]It's not good.
[116:45.10]Okay.
[116:51.03]Although talking can be a little harder.
[116:55.41]But I'm going to do my darndest.
[116:57.87]That's not a door.
[117:03.53]Anything else in here?
[117:07.05]I don't believe there is.
[117:16.36]Put on the facecam?
[117:20.23]No, I don't want you to watch me eat.
[117:21.21]Listen to this guy die in season 3?

[117:35.44]No, come here.
[117:36.02]Yes.

[118:27.77]Alright, keep this guy with fists.
[118:35.38]What about you?
[118:35.86]Trucks are a good place to start.
[118:38.30]I started by robbing trucks.
[118:40.16]He's a glass of milk.
[118:40.70]I remember telling Pop.
[118:43.03]I like it when it gets stuck.
[118:44.35]I like when it gets stuck down there and I like.
[118:46.41]Every man has one destiny.
[118:52.08]I can, like, feel the world closing in.
[118:53.48]Like, the blackness around me.
[118:55.10]Like, tunnel vision.
[118:55.88]You still here from the accident?
[118:57.62]Get out of here.
[118:58.10]Do I know you?
[119:19.76]Yeah, I just crashed into you.
[119:21.24]And ran away.
[119:36.89]He's not dead.
[119:37.59]He's fine.
[119:42.59]That's a dead end.
[119:43.27]That's a trap right there.
[119:48.26]How much am I into the jungle?
[119:50.78]Should have got the attack buff.
[119:55.62]It kind of... Look, that's the first thing I thought of.
[119:58.34]Just reminded me of, like, a MOBA jungle.
[119:59.71]I don't know why.
[120:00.29]The way the lane looked.
[120:03.59]You can read.
[120:04.07]You can figure it out.
[120:09.61]Let's go get the money.

[120:25.69]I just said yes.
[120:41.62]Can I extort it out of him?
[121:01.42]Need a new car.
[121:11.21]Why do they always get out that other side?
[121:16.03]You know how hard that is to do?
[121:20.75]Next time you get a chance.
[121:21.51]When you're driving a car.
[121:24.97]Put it in park.
[121:27.65]Try to just get out to the passenger seat as fast as you can in less than a second You won't do it.
[121:33.04]It's not it's hard to go over the console the the Terminator the transmission the all the shit in the middle It's impossible This is my turn.

[122:13.50]You're free to go, citizen.
[122:15.90]How do I do, like, the salute?
[122:19.32]No, that was easy.
[122:21.28]That was the most money I've made for the least amount of work.
[122:24.61]I'm having fun in this game, and I know it's supposed to be a bunch of other PlayStation 3... Alright, should I change games?
[122:30.23]I'm gonna put this in the pile.
[122:32.01]Like, I'm gonna put this in The Simpsons hit-and-run pile.
[122:35.42]Ones that we're going to give it extra time to.
[122:37.10]You know?
[122:47.03]No, no.

[123:11.15]We're gonna do this last mission here, and save it.
[123:12.73]And we'll go from there.
[123:36.49]Hey, it's me.
[123:37.09]Are we gonna sing?
[123:37.57]Yeah, we'll give extra computer time with this one at some point.
[123:41.31]Yeah, I gotta be careful.
[123:42.17]You can't eat that much peanut butter or else you'll die.
[124:06.31]If you eat a jar of peanut butter, it'll kill you.
[124:12.14]It turns back into peanuts in your stomach.
[124:15.26]Don't do it.
[124:18.78]Yeah, yeah, yeah, trucks.
[124:19.82]Attack the trucks.
[124:22.79]Keep the driver alive.
[124:23.75]Those smugglers are always part of some racket.
[124:29.59]Find out where they're going and talk to the boss.
[124:32.65]You might be able to take over the whole shebang.
[124:35.30]You're allergic.
[124:37.30]It never specified.
[124:38.12]Dawn's still in bad shape.
[124:39.90]Why don't you go over to the hospital in Little Italy and keep an eye on things?
[124:44.46]You think there's going to be trouble?
[124:45.90]The police got the building under wraps, but they're not our guys, and I don't trust them.
[124:53.57]Alright, go to the hospital.
[124:56.69]Interesting.
[124:57.11]Alright.
[124:59.05]What's my feelings on chunky peanut butter?
[125:02.36]I mean, it has a place, I think.
[125:03.52]It has a time and place.
[125:04.30]I just don't like it.
[125:06.80]75% of the time.
[125:07.56]I used to know somebody that put in their car that, like, has a horn.
[125:10.16]She used to scare the shit out of people.
[125:33.03]We were parked at like a Dairy Queen, or we'd get an ice cream, or we got like the drive-thru at McDonald's.
[125:38.63]She would aruga people, and... The look on people's faces, you could never even... It's probably priceless.
[125:49.44]Everybody goes, and turns around and has this shit face.
[126:05.69]Yeah, it's very loud.
[126:08.06]You know when somebody wants to pass you, or if you're at a four-way stop, and everybody stops, and you, oh yeah, like, beep-beep, like, you go.
[126:16.70]You can't do that with that horn.
[126:19.26]You will scare that person into a car accident.
[126:23.52]Because there is no little, there is no small light.
[126:28.09]Once you press that button, it was always just 100% or 0%.
[126:35.07]You like chunky peanut butter with mayo and turkey?
[126:37.27]I mean, I know that's a joke, but... It's revolting.
[127:04.64]She banned that person?
[127:07.64]Holy shit.
[127:07.86]What?
[127:07.96]What does that mean?
[127:35.05]What was that?
[127:35.63]I don't know.
[127:36.09]I can't take that.
[127:37.05]What kind of signal was that?
[127:39.27]By the way, that loading screen is Snoopy's cousin Spike's face.
[127:43.54]How's it going there, Chief?
[127:45.80]With the whiskers coming down, that's his face.
[127:49.68]Hey, no weapons inside.
[127:51.60]Hand him over.
[127:52.52]No problem.
[127:53.74]You know where Monk Malone is?
[127:55.50]You mean Marty Malone?
[127:56.99]He's upstairs, second floor.
[128:01.39]You get all this back when you leave.
[128:07.18]Alright, that didn't work.
[128:08.88]Find Monk's room.
[128:10.76]Let's go find his room.
[128:16.33]Just aggressive to everybody.
[128:17.85]Look at how comfy he looks.
[128:22.41]I envy his level of comfort right now.
[128:30.41]So you decided to come look up my little brother after all?
[128:33.50]Stop squaring up.
[128:34.32]What was that?
[128:35.38]Oh no!
[128:36.72]It's an assassin!
[128:37.20]We don't have any weapons.
[128:37.86]We're unarmed.
[129:07.41]Can I throw something at him?
[129:10.71]Three, two, one, go!
[129:11.81]Why is he blocking this?
[129:15.07]Why you block- Okay, time to stop this.
[129:18.72]Alright, I'm good.
[129:38.04]Is that it?
[129:41.53]Hospitals are pretty locked down.
[129:43.13]I don't know how that would be possible to get in there.
[129:44.95]Who are you?
[129:48.01]Think of his gun?
[129:48.61]We don't need guns.
[130:03.77]I'm going to get the nurse to move my father to another room.
[130:06.19]You better get your girl out of here.
[130:07.55]There's a way out through the basement.
[130:08.87]Go find Tom Hagen.
[130:10.07]Tell him what's going on.
[130:12.29]Keep away from the front door.
[130:13.49]They may be out there already.
[130:18.12]Don't eat chunky peanut butter.
[130:19.22]It's gross.
[130:19.82]Spike.
[130:20.74]There he is.
[130:23.82]That stairway's over here.
[130:36.40]We need a weapon.
[130:37.20]I need a plank of wood or something.
[130:39.42]Somewhere.
[130:40.46]Anywhere.
[130:40.80]There we go.
[130:43.06]Apparently the doctors and nurses keep long-barreled shotguns just hanging out in the hospital.
[130:50.01]Okay.
[130:51.75]I'd believe it.
[130:55.41]This is locked.
[130:56.07]Alright, let's make this quick.
[131:00.19]Did he say don't shoot?
[131:01.15]Oh, I think that was a good guy.
[131:21.41]I need health.
[131:21.95]I only got one more bullet with the shotgun.
[131:31.32]Oh, that's too bad.
[131:34.08]I really thought I had that.
[131:42.10]That's it, right?
[131:49.87]Come on out.
[131:59.76]Nothing else drop?
[132:00.42]There's a guy right here and he's gonna kill me.
[132:09.84]I'm gonna execute somebody with the gun.
[132:13.50]Gotta get close enough.
[132:18.97]What is she doing?
[132:19.79]Why is she staring at me through here?
[132:35.67]Alright, we're good.
[132:39.68]Out!
[132:43.66]Is Don Corleone still in here?
[132:46.90]Oh, thanks for coming in here.
[132:49.80]I thought I was gonna bleed out.
[132:52.59]I've been in this pack of this thing for four days.
[132:55.01]Look at there.
[133:01.79]Health packs or anything.
[133:08.29]Gonna go back upstairs.
[133:10.27]Hey, there we go.
[133:11.75]That's what I'm talking about.
[133:12.87]Nothing else?
[133:24.96]Itchy face, hold on.
[133:26.00]There we go.
[133:27.64]Where's that goddamn staircase?
[133:48.43]Get down.
[133:50.27]Oh, shit.
[133:50.87]I broke his neck with this thing.
[133:59.03]That was actually pretty cool.
[133:59.95]Okay, give me some.
[134:10.90]Still need more ammo.
[134:14.84]Oh!
[134:17.02]No, that's... Okay, that's him.
[134:18.91]Follow me.
[134:19.97]We've got to cover the front entrance.
[134:29.07]I thought I got all you Guinea-hoods locked up.
[134:33.04]What the hell are you doing here?
[134:34.26]What's a Turk paying you to set up my father, Captain?
[134:36.86]Take a hold of him.
[134:38.00]Stand him up.
[134:38.96]Stand him up straight.
[134:42.28]Told you not to get involved, didn't I?
[134:48.37]I'm an attorney for the Corleone family.
[134:50.65]These men are private detectives hired to protect Vito Corleone.
[134:54.31]If you interfere, you'll have to appear before a judge in the morning to show cause.
[134:59.79]He punches that guy in the face, too.
[135:07.81]I just don't belong here.
[135:09.54]I don't look like I belong to the Corleone family.
[135:12.90]Alright, let's go.
[135:15.56]I want to buy some stuff.
[135:19.21]Let's see what we can get for actual interesting things.
[135:30.16]Save, and I need a save house.
[135:36.82]Which is right here.
[135:41.27]No, right here.
[135:43.81]Close enough, don't matter.
[135:50.91]I hate this name.
[135:51.67]Tim Italian.
[135:59.39]That's a bad name, isn't it?
[136:01.01]Who came up with this?
[136:04.01]Alright, I need a legend.
[136:14.10]Because I want to go to the clothing store, but I can't see what any of these are because they're really bright and blurry.
[136:20.39]Which one of these is a place where I can buy clothes?
[136:22.61]Or do I have to do it in the main menu?
[136:24.57]I would assume I probably have to do it in the main menu.
[136:27.20]Let's save the game.
[136:30.64]Buy some clothes and then we'll probably stop there.
[136:34.20]What time is it?
[136:40.49]1030.
[136:41.13]I'm gonna have to get going here.
[136:44.27]We'll do one more.
[136:44.99]We'll do one more game.
[136:47.33]But I have to skedaddle.
[136:51.57]Things to do in the morning.
[137:01.39]Wait, did you say why is Jerma Mercury Thanos?
[137:07.46]No, the new emote is not Thanos.
[137:11.20]Although you could, I guess if you want to be.
[137:19.43]The new emotes are Jerma Mercury, Jerma Jaxx, Jerma Jaxx 2, and the Golden Biaya Artifact, which is 10 bucks.
[137:30.61]Not to be confused with the $25 MS Paint one, yeah.
[137:33.69]Those are the new emotes.
[137:37.07]And very soon here, because I told you at... There was a point where we're doing an emote contest.
[137:44.68]So, I'm not sure if I want to do it in more than five slots at first.
[137:54.43]But it will probably be for five slots.
[138:00.94]We'll get into that later.
[138:01.80]Probably next week.
[138:06.32]I want to go... Oh, here we go.
[138:09.73]Hold on.
[138:11.51]No, I don't want to watch this.
[138:15.57]Uh, load game.
[138:18.81]How did we get to that screen where it was... Oh, check out the store!
[138:26.00]Dammit man, was I really playing this for like almost two hours?
[138:28.02]Or is it just gonna put me in a- Here we go, enter the tailor shop.
[138:43.71]No, that looks awful.
[138:45.39]Continue shopping.
[138:48.75]Horn, rims, no I don't want glasses.
[138:50.51]Hats.
[138:53.76]Oh, I just bought it.
[138:54.36]I bought it.
[138:55.26]Didn't even mean to.
[138:56.56]Oh, well.
[139:00.78]It's on there now.
[139:01.54]Pants.
[139:06.47]Shirt and coat.
[139:07.61]Double-breasted coats.
[139:09.23]Dress shirts.
[139:14.69]Something I already have on.
[139:19.28]Rolled up a tie.
[139:20.30]What about double-breasted coats?
[139:33.95]Come on, you can't give me anything else besides darks, purple, brown.
[139:38.42]I just look like a shitty reporter from the Spider-Man universe.
[139:43.64]Fine.
[139:58.67]There we go.
[140:03.35]Alright, so let's do the film archive.
[140:05.42]Here we go.
[140:05.84]Movie.
[140:06.18]Let's watch the Godfather.
[140:13.26]You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
[140:14.66]No, no.
[140:15.16]I slept on a plane.
[140:16.26]Huh?
[140:16.46]I got the Sollozzo notes here.
[140:20.46]Now.
[140:20.96]I'm not going to get banned.
[140:21.71]This is just one scene of the whole movie.
[140:23.85]Sollozzo is known as the Turk.
[140:27.13]He's supposed to be very good with a knife, but only in matters of business with some sort of reasonable complaint.
[140:34.12]Uh, his business is narcotic.
[140:36.20]That's the whole movie.
[140:40.74]Alright, what about... Uh... No, we're not gonna sit here and watch The Godfather.
[140:47.47]Alright, last one.
[140:48.43]I'm gonna put it in right now.
[140:49.27]Let's get it.
[140:51.33]Before I go.
[140:52.71]Okay.
[141:04.93]You guys have no idea.
[141:07.23]This is not playing.
[141:11.14]And the final one of the night.
[141:13.93]Let's do it.
[141:35.03]Just wait.
[141:48.28]It was destiny.
[141:50.10]It had to be done.
[142:06.16]Yeah, The Sopranos.
[142:09.10]Do I have... How many fucking Italian crime family PlayStation 2 games do I own?
[142:24.87]Yeah, Sopranos.
[142:26.31]Road to being a made godfather.
[142:30.11]By the way, I think the disk is broken.
[142:31.45]No, we're good.
[142:37.77]I don't want any more of this, please.
[142:42.49]Well, don't worry.
[142:43.07]You're probably never going to see half of these ever again.
[142:48.53]Shut the door.
[142:48.93]The door's closed.
[142:55.76]This game has nudity.
[142:57.72]Oh, well.
[143:04.90]Am I going to play Destroy All Humans?
[143:06.24]Oh, yeah.
[143:07.62]I have both.
[143:08.16]I have Destroy All Humans 1 and 2.
[143:09.34]We're going to play through a lot more of the first one and then I want to at least jump in the second one for a while.
[143:17.53]People were telling me to skip to the second one already because they just said it's a lot better and a lot more.
[143:23.79]Can this start or is this just going to end now?
[143:29.94]What's wrong with this disk?
[143:45.89]This one's having trouble, but it's here.
[143:53.58]It's loading up the entire Sopranos show, but that's bullshit because we just loaded up the entire Godfather show.
[144:03.56]It's a troll face?
[144:05.60]No, that's just my face.
[144:15.70]Yeah, they cut to black right in the beginning.
[144:18.54]It's over.
[144:20.10]Oh, I gotta clean the disk or something.
[144:22.02]Hold on.
[144:24.59]Was it like dirty?
[144:25.33]Let me try this one more time.
[144:29.71]Should I spit on it?
[144:38.29]Problem?
[144:38.99]No.
[144:39.91]It's not a fucking troll face.
[144:41.45]Don't use it like that.
[144:59.24]Blow on it?
[144:59.72]I just wiped it.
[145:02.21]I wiped it with some wetness and my shirt.
[145:05.57]Should be fine.
[145:09.07]No, I think this is inevitable.
[145:11.97]The Sopranos doesn't work.
[145:13.93]There's another disk in here, though.
[145:15.01]What is this one?
[145:18.32]No, this is bonus content.
[145:19.70]This is going to be DVD and cast interview trailers and stuff.
[145:28.87]Alright.
[145:29.39]Well, that's... What else?
[145:34.45]Do I have anything else that I could throw in there right now?
[145:37.05]That's so dumb.
[145:37.79]Why is it broken or something?
[145:44.45]Do I got any more?
[145:45.11]I got any more Mafia or Italian mob themed games?
[145:50.79]No, I don't.
[145:51.45]That's it.
[145:57.15]Are you mad?
[145:59.67]I mean, I'm kind of mad because I bought this.
[146:03.17]Oh, shit.
[146:04.33]Here we are.
[146:04.77]We're good.
[146:11.06]Play poker.
[146:20.92]No.
[146:21.64]People would rather me turn the stream off than have this work.
[146:24.14]That's so funny.
[146:33.17]Back to the peanut butter.
[146:33.89]We'll watch the intro.
[146:47.38]God damn it.
[146:50.40]Just load up the song.
[147:00.03]hey Jimmy just want to say that wow we got flashed I'm sorry about that peanut butter and mayonnaise alright come on just go to sleep the first scene

[147:33.31]Thanks.
[147:33.81]Yeah, you're welcome.
[147:36.15]This is what we actually waited this long for?
[147:37.99]What?
[147:38.11]I don't know.
[147:38.93]Right at the very beginning?
[147:42.30]Hold L1 to grab.
[147:43.10]R1 to interrogate and punch.
[147:56.06]You use the left analog stick to move and the right analog stick to look around.
[148:08.34]Beat up the drunk.
[148:10.88]Grab enemies when you get close.

[149:12.04]Go get that guy.
[149:13.48]Sure.
[149:15.98]You can't fight people.
[149:16.80]Am I actually about to go in here?
[149:22.65]It's not actual.
[149:23.57]It's PlayStation 2 nudity.
[149:26.31]That means there is none.
[149:34.01]There were no games like this that had nudity on the PlayStation 2.
[149:42.70]See?
[149:43.94]Right at the very beginning.
[149:51.92]Oh, fuck.
[149:52.80]Something drunk pinched Jasmine's ass.
[149:58.17]Was that the CD or was that the game?
[149:59.59]Oh, look this way.
[150:00.90]Okay, I'm gonna try.
[150:02.44]I'll try to avoid it as best I can.
[150:30.98]Okay, nobody in here.
[150:31.86]Up the stairs, we're good.
[150:42.45]Nudity gone.
[150:43.55]Do you think these girls put out?
[150:48.87]If you pay them enough.
[150:53.56]Keeping you busy, Joey?
[150:55.36]I just do what I'm told.
[150:58.25]I'm actually sick.
[150:59.69]No, stop looking out there.
[151:01.27]What?
[151:04.53]How do I stop?
[151:05.94]Skip it.
[151:08.20]Oh, it's because I pressed look at.
[151:10.12]Oh my god.
[151:13.84]No, they're everywhere.
[151:15.00]I can't escape them.
[151:23.58]Choose an attitude?
[151:27.57]Can't complain.
[151:28.67]Listen, Nicky, you gotta mix it up a little.
[151:30.75]The girls are getting pissy.
[151:34.48]Tough.
[151:40.28]Tough.
[151:41.90]I want to be tough with him.
[151:45.71]So, what's new?
[151:46.77]You need to smash the table with your fist for a second.
[151:53.33]And consider it an order, asswipe.
[151:55.41]Change it.
[151:55.93]Just turn around and bump the table.
[151:57.51]Silvio says I can play what I want.
[152:00.28]Your loving cousin also said I could break your fucking head.
[152:04.48]The Scylla's gonna fucking hear about this.
[152:06.32]I guarantee you.
[152:08.36]Here.
[152:10.04]Okay, maybe this'll shut him up.
[152:11.70]What?
[152:16.66]Alright, return to Dippy.
[152:20.32]Now this I can dance to.
[152:22.24]Wanna watch?
[152:23.78]You know, I usually charge big time for this.
[152:25.77]Hey, I'm happy to pay, beautiful.
[152:29.47]Your mother raised you right, Joey, but this one's on me.
[152:51.74]It's like I'm giving him the lap dance now.
[152:55.89]We're good.
[153:07.29]How is this a chrono game?
[153:15.93]Hey G, what are you doing here?
[153:18.45]Thought I'd say hello.
[153:20.25]Find out if you talk to Paulie, you know, about me.
[153:22.73]Give him a laugh.
[153:23.98]This ain't a club, Rich.
[153:25.48]They don't need new members.
[153:27.02]Hey, Joey.
[153:28.82]Oh, I know that guy.
[153:29.74]That's the dog from Family Guy.
[153:32.42]Remember when Brian died and they got a new dog?
[153:35.30]It's that guy.
[153:45.67]Where are they?
[153:51.65]Weren't they just in this room?
[153:52.91]Did they just call my name from in this room?
[154:02.14]I haven't lost my mind, have I?
[154:07.64]Is it?
[154:09.56]There he is.
[154:13.19]Not lately.
[154:20.34]I'm not asking for a second opinion.
[154:22.12]Gonna be tough every time.
[154:23.08]I heard the man.
[154:24.14]Tony.
[154:25.22]His voice.
[154:26.13]Just a mirage, my friend.
[154:28.07]He ain't here.
[154:29.43]Don't be so fucking stupid.
[154:31.11]You see a mirage, you don't hear it.
[154:33.31]Who doesn't know that?
[154:35.15]Son of a bitch!
[154:37.37]Now go clean up.
[154:38.69]Before I do something with Bopper.
[154:42.27]I'm ready to get kind of stops and burps for a second.
[154:44.19]Where the hell were you?
[154:45.73]I'm starving out here.
[154:46.99]Now you get out of here before I do something I'm going to regret.
[154:50.23]Get me a pastrami sandwich with Dijon mustard.
[154:53.01]And see if Tony wants anything.
[154:55.66]I thought he wasn't here.
[154:57.26]You thought wrong, bonehead.
[154:58.98]He's in the office.
[155:01.14]Get the order.
[155:02.40]Is it in the bathroom?
[155:18.35]Why did I just hit the exit on that door?
[155:19.83]It's gonna take us three minutes to load this.
[155:29.07]Your first quest is make him a sandwich.
[155:47.28]Got any funny jokes?
[155:50.19]Um... Yeah.
[155:53.69]That's called, see how far we can run before the game doesn't let us anymore.
[155:57.65]Fuck that.
[155:58.49]That's it.
[155:59.39]We found it.
[156:00.29]That's it.
[156:01.41]That's as far as you can go.
[156:04.59]Oh, nice.
[156:19.18]I'm gonna troll everybody.
[156:22.98]Fucking troll face.
[156:24.06]I don't even care.
[156:25.70]Alright, we're gonna go to the office.
[156:38.05]What's the deal?
[156:38.51]Is this the guy's grunge band thing?
[156:40.29]Where's the office here?
[156:44.62]This game runs at like nine frames a second, so I'm sorry.
[156:47.62]It's hard to do anything.
[156:53.63]If this game runs out, it hurts.
[156:58.13]Is this the office?
[157:01.45]No.
[157:03.65]Stop this song.
[157:05.49]I can't stop this song.
[157:07.91]Just go get the remaster.
[157:21.55]There's no way.
[157:28.72]Go to the other door?
[157:29.72]I thought that was an emergency exit.
[157:33.54]You don't make your employees only a red and white s- That's emergency exit!
[157:39.55]Employees only emergency exit.
[157:46.47]Hey, Jeremy Jordan.
[157:48.03]I just want to say that my son really likes your epic new... Oh, you did the thing that everyone has done.
[157:52.25]You did the thing that everyone's about spamming here.
[157:54.17]What's this good joke?
[157:54.95]What is this?
[157:57.08]Got any funny joke?
[157:59.84]Yeah.
[158:01.66]That's called... I didn't make a joke.
[158:03.56]I was actually seeing that.
[158:13.89]Hey, Paul.
[158:14.41]You want to dance?
[158:16.26]Hey, Joey.
[158:16.94]Only fine woman here.
[158:18.98]How come you don't have a girlfriend?
[158:20.92]I like to spread the wealth.
[158:27.87]Oh, man.
[158:30.83]Buddy, you don't come to a strip club to play the golf arcade cabinet.
[158:38.82]This is awful dancing.
[158:42.22]This is not enjoyable.
[158:43.24]Why would this be very unenjoyable?
[158:46.18]I would laugh at this person.
[158:54.86]Damn it, LaRocca!
[158:55.86]Your score's going down!
[159:06.61]Well, I'm not gonna get banned.
[159:11.47]How you been, Charlie?
[159:12.49]You're looking sharp.
[159:13.83]Trying to keep the weight off, you know?
[159:17.77]That's the human.
[159:19.27]That's the human from World of Warcraft.
[159:20.61]That's the guy from two nights ago.
[159:22.45]That's the human.
[159:23.61]I walked into an apothecary.
[159:26.05]It is.
[159:26.95]That's the human from World of Warcraft.
[159:31.39]What was he in?
[159:32.85]Destroy all humans.
[159:33.45]It happens.
[159:46.12]Alright, is there like a super secret employee room or what?
[159:55.31]I can't go in any of these doors.
[159:57.63]What about these guys in the corner?
[159:59.69]Hey Joey, you wanna play poker later?
[160:01.47]Sure.
[160:02.01]Move a little ca- Oh!
[160:04.14]Oh!
[160:05.14]Do I know you?
[160:07.34]My cousin, Joey.
[160:08.20]Yeah, he didn't mean nothin'.
[160:09.72]Hey, I didn't know the guy was mobbed up.
[160:12.70]Just keep your fuckin' mouth shut.
[160:17.37]Is there anywhere else I can go?
[160:18.67]Over here?
[160:20.76]That's the exit.
[160:24.34]Okay, I found it.
[160:25.14]Yeah, what are your sandwich orders?
[160:30.13]Which must mean you're buying.
[160:31.87]Give me a salami on rye, lettuce, mayo, mustard.
[160:34.45]Chicken soup with rice.
[160:36.85]Lots of pickles.
[160:37.51]Cheeseburger and a vanilla shake.
[160:41.33]Sounds like this.
[160:42.17]If it's chocolate, you're fucking taking it back.
[160:44.22]Got it?
[160:45.80]It's like grandpa mixed with Don Corleone.
[160:47.38]Thanks.
[160:47.88]I'm off the AC.
[160:49.10]Then I'm dropping by the bachelor party.
[160:50.78]You're gonna spy on your future son-in-law and then tell your daughter?
[160:55.14]He can look but not touch.
[160:56.70]Those are the rules.
[160:58.94]Hey, you're a defense attorney, counselor, not a prosecutor.
[161:02.32]I feel sorry for the fucking kid, marrying into the Perry Mason family.
[161:07.46]I added that emote, and it's... I'm deleting it.
[161:11.84]Tonight.
[161:13.14]How's Paulie's little meeting going out there?
[161:15.57]The guy's a fucking moron, if you ask me.
[161:18.87]Considering his family, not a big surprise.
[161:21.53]Who is he?
[161:22.74]If you needed to know, you'd already know.
[161:24.14]Is that actually Jonathan Alexander?
[161:26.22]He's in a lounge.
[161:27.80]The man might be hungry.
[161:28.88]Hi.
[161:37.05]What's his name?
[161:39.95]Jeremy Gandolfini?
[161:41.79]James Gandolfini.
[161:43.43]There it is.
[161:47.32]Do I really want to get a sandwich for somebody?
[161:52.19]Return to Pauly.
[161:56.19]Where am I going?
[161:57.05]What door did I just open?
[161:59.05]I opened a loading screen door.
[162:00.27]It was mustard with... No, I'm good.
[162:19.96]Alright, where's Pauly?
[162:22.88]Where's Paulie?
[162:23.86]He's over here.
[162:25.54]Paulie?
[162:25.96]Did you get Tony's order?
[162:28.94]Tony, Chris, Silvio, got them all.
[162:31.67]You forgot that fat fuck Vito.
[162:33.93]You think he ain't hungry?
[162:35.51]Go check the lounge.
[162:36.87]Oh, my God.
[162:39.23]Sorry, Paulie.
[162:40.39]Will do.
[162:40.81]Go get that fat fuck's order.
[162:44.87]Hey, did you go up there and get that fat fuck's order?
[162:52.24]There he is, that fat fuck.
[162:55.04]You ever talk to Tony?
[162:56.32]Like I tell you.
[162:58.06]Wait.
[162:58.34]Do I have to go back?
[163:01.74]The lounge.
[163:13.06]Go piss on somebody else, okay?
[163:14.92]What do you want for a sandwich?
[163:18.78]Do I have to go back?
[163:19.40]Tony was in the f- uh, n-noth of the- Ah, I gotta go back?
[163:25.28]He asked me why I don't have a girlfriend.
[163:45.55]You're getting trolled.
[163:49.46]I actually do have to go back there.
[163:50.82]Oh my god, that fat fuck.
[164:05.23]I have to at least do the first mission before I leave the stream.
[164:16.31]He's in the stripper room.
[164:18.92]He's next to Arcade Guy.
[164:23.04]Yeah, Arcade Guy was in here.
[164:24.18]There's that fat fuck.
[164:29.18]Vito, I'm ordering takeout.
[164:31.32]Hey, my friend was talking to one of the strippers.
[164:33.92]I hear you fucking threw him out.
[164:36.50]Yeah, then I beat his ass.
[164:39.14]He pinched Jasmine.
[164:41.50]You fucking dick.
[164:43.64]Whoa.
[164:45.14]I hurt your friend pretty bad.
[164:46.66]You want to be next?
[164:48.46]You tell him, Joey.
[164:50.34]Get out of here, Jez.
[164:50.96]This ain't something a lady should see.
[164:53.36]You want me to act all scared?
[164:54.84]Well, fuck you.
[164:56.38]I ain't scared.
[164:56.86]Do you just beat up drunk people in this game?
[165:02.08]Got a madman over here.
[165:08.05]Eat this.
[165:08.53]The shove.
[165:09.65]It's breaking your nose.
[165:10.75]You know who you're fucking... Not bad, rookie.
[165:15.08]Thanks, Vito.
[165:16.44]So like I was saying before douchebag number two interrupted, I'm getting takeout.
[165:20.61]You want something?
[165:22.79]Low-fat turkey, no bread, no mayo, no potato salad.
[165:26.81]Just meat and a pickle.
[165:28.17]That's some real boobs right there.
[165:32.77]We just got to see real boobs.
[165:37.00]God damn it.
[165:40.34]Why am I reacting like a fucking 14-year-old?
[165:52.77]Whatever.
[165:55.35]Those were digital.
[166:03.94]Can't shut up.
[166:05.30]Alright, another order.
[166:06.56]Use the bathroom.
[166:19.82]I thought that was me.
[166:21.70]I was gonna say, why?
[166:23.79]This guy- Huh?
[166:28.85]What's happening?
[166:31.53]Take- What am I supposed to do?
[166:36.83]Why are we standing here?
[166:37.69]I could- Alright, I- The desk is skipping.
[166:45.44]But I couldn't tell because the song sounds exactly the same.
[166:53.10]There was no difference.
[167:03.04]What is his order?
[167:04.30]What happened?
[167:07.04]I'm this cocksucker.
[167:08.42]Well, maybe you like seeing your captain disrespect.
[167:13.12]Fuck this guy.
[167:14.22]He's lucky he ain't fucking dead.
[167:16.74]Hey, you never know.
[167:17.94]You know what I mean?
[167:18.66]He was like, uh.
[167:20.63]Another drunk guy to beat up.
[167:21.81]Let's see if this wall's a mirage.
[167:24.62]Whatever you say, Paulie.
[167:30.68]It's pretty real to me.
[167:32.06]I'm playing.
[167:33.18]Enough already.
[167:34.02]Clean him up.
[167:35.30]At first.
[167:40.83]What if I don't?
[167:46.17]Just a little bit closer.
[167:47.81]Just a little closer.
[167:49.97]Yeah, I know.
[167:52.07]Just right there.
[167:52.57]Okay, you're going to feel a pinch in your neck here.
[167:55.82]What I want you to do is I want you to just slowly pull your left arm backwards.
[167:58.68]There you go.
[167:59.02]You're going to hear a slight crunch, but that's because we're working out the lumbar section of your back, as you understand.
[168:06.43]This is what you came here for, so lean forward.
[168:09.55]Okay, quick pinch.
[168:17.56]Alright, forget that fuck.
[168:19.36]Now go pick up my sandwich.
[168:23.74]I didn't call it in yet, Paulie.
[168:24.82]I've been running non-stop.
[168:26.60]I'll do it right now.
[168:28.78]You killed him.
[168:32.62]You stupid shit.
[168:34.94]Why did you hit his head so hard?
[168:36.79]What is going on?
[168:38.41]Hey, we both kicked his ass, Paulie.
[168:39.89]I think the disk is really fucked up.
[168:41.31]I didn't think it was going to fucking die.
[168:43.43]Get him out of here.
[168:45.13]He got dropped.
[168:49.76]Yeah, you.
[168:50.60]Get rid of the body, his car, his piece.
[168:56.04]There's bloodbath, all of it.
[168:58.06]And no fuck-ups.
[169:01.13]Can Reggie give me a hand?
[169:02.23]That idiot out front?
[169:04.63]If anything happens, it's your red.
[169:06.91]You hear?
[169:07.49]Yeah.
[169:08.13]Sure thing.
[169:08.71]All I can do is laugh at this man.
[169:10.67]I got nothing to say.
[169:13.08]New move unlocked.
[169:14.10]What is this song?
[169:18.94]Cosa Nostra Catnap, choke enemy.
[169:26.30]No, I won't be playing this again.
[169:33.06]So wait, I don't go get sandwiches?
[169:40.01]I didn't even take his order.
[169:47.63]I thought I was going to get sandwiches.
[169:57.89]We were just driving that car backwards.
[170:01.33]I got a good feeling about this.
[170:04.20]About dumping a dead guy?
[170:06.24]Paulie asked me to help.
[170:08.56]I think he's going to give me a shot working on his crew.
[170:11.98]Reggie, he called you that idiot out front.
[170:14.88]Why did he back up?
[170:15.98]Just busting my balls.
[170:18.65]They usually do that to your face.
[170:20.87]Believe what you want.
[170:22.51]But I deserve this.
[170:23.66]This is my car.
[170:26.06]Not all of us grew up knowing Tony Soprano.
[170:29.04]Fuck you.
[170:30.25]Like I don't hear enough of that shit from Christopher?
[170:33.52]You know what I mean.
[170:34.53]I ain't trying to be a dick, Joey.
[170:36.73]I just want what you have.
[170:37.71]I'm so tired right now that, like, everything's making me laugh.
[170:39.59]You mean her father was a fucking legend for being a rat?
[170:41.89]Who betrayed his oldest friends, then fucking disappeared?
[170:45.03]I got shit, Reggie.
[170:47.09]And where is this?
[170:48.54]Another drunk, guys.
[170:49.90]This is beat up the drunks.
[170:52.20]He shall die.
[170:54.08]He shall die as it was written.
[170:56.82]Just what we need, a preacher on Rotgut.
[170:59.26]Hey, you, shut the fuck up.
[171:04.84]This guy just hates people that consume alcohol, apparently.
[171:09.83]Special attacks.
[171:17.65]Yeah, this is just the Punisher.
[171:27.67]Yeah, you can hold it and you can throw.
[171:32.03]Forget about him!
[171:37.38]Hurry it up, Joey.
[171:38.26]We got work to do.
[171:39.30]Can I drive over him with the car?
[171:42.13]We're fucking around.
[171:45.99]Will he attack him?
[172:00.45]Alright, I got it.
[172:08.81]Man, I could smell that stinkin' bum from here.
[172:12.35]Just grab the load, okay?
[172:15.51]Goddammit.
[172:18.05]Now we gotta put him in the trunk too.
[172:19.98]We gotta bury them both.
[172:29.20]Toss the body into the water.
[172:30.39]Alright, gimme it.
[172:32.63]Let's go.
[172:38.79]You're not actually gonna move that slowly, are you?
[172:42.43]Oh, for the love of God.
[172:44.31]Escort mission.
[173:06.45]He's in mid-strive, but he's not moving.
[173:09.75]Go on, explore.
[173:11.31]I'll just wait here with a fucking stiff over my shoulder.
[173:14.17]Alright, I think it's time.
[173:16.71]In a moment here.
[173:20.23]How you doing?
[173:21.52]Hey, hey, what the hell is that?
[173:24.30]It's a roller carpet.
[173:26.36]You pay extra for the feet sticking out?
[173:29.20]Get back in your fucking truck.
[173:31.40]How about I call the cops instead?
[173:35.85]Did he just turn into that guy?
[173:41.64]The guy that was standing behind- the guy with the body just turned into this dude.
[173:48.08]Oh my god.
[173:48.58]Pick up or drop weapons with triangle.
[173:51.77]Weapons deal more damage than other attacks.
[173:54.95]Well that was easy.
[174:04.64]Let's sink that fucker and get out of here.
[174:06.80]That was very easy.
[174:07.40]You're not going in there, are you?
[174:08.88]He's lying directly on top of his body.
[174:11.30]He got in the same sleeping bag.
[174:14.74]That was awesome.
[174:21.90]That ain't worth shit.
[174:22.80]They both died in the exact same place.
[174:24.44]Oh my god, that's gonna be so rare.
[174:28.16]That's gonna be so rare.
[174:29.24]Dude, look at how fucking rare that is.
[174:41.87]Of course, vintage porn.
[174:42.99]Okay.
[174:44.45]Hotspot attack.
[174:45.59]Look at how much that's closing.
[174:54.85]Oh my god.
[174:57.37]That just hurt me.
[174:59.27]I felt that.
[175:12.54]Clear my god it ain't worth much, but I imagine has already doing that to you This is the Punisher you weren't kidding Joey what are you doing here?
[175:28.75]I already paid for me Six more months.

[175:37.74]Wait, he's got a sledgehammer?
[175:38.88]Okay, sledgehammer versus handsaw.
[176:07.29]I just knocked his glasses off.
[176:08.37]I just broke his glasses in half.
[176:10.75]I hit him so hard.
[176:27.76]Alright.
[176:30.70]Let's go.
[176:34.92]Let's see what he's carrying.
[176:55.07]Must be a thousand bucks here.

[177:03.87]Gotta be worth five hundred at least.
[177:07.58]Paulie said to disappear the guy and his stuff.
[177:10.88]Fuck Paulie.
[177:11.92]You get the... Uh-oh, we have an argument here.
[177:14.60]I'm gonna have to settle this with the smooth or tough.
[177:17.32]I get the watch.
[177:19.04]Fine.
[177:19.73]You finished?
[177:20.69]What about the piece?
[177:22.03]Give it to me.
[177:25.10]Let's get rid of this guy.
[177:26.82]You bring those blocks?
[177:29.40]Shit, I forgot.
[177:30.80]I saw some chains back there.
[177:32.36]We could weigh them down with those.
[177:40.27]There we go.
[177:40.91]Get it.
[177:46.57]There.
[177:51.97]It's like when I couldn't scream.
[177:53.57]Like dropping screams.
[177:55.57]Which I haven't done tonight, so.
[177:58.51]Remarkable.
[177:59.17]Usually at like 8, 9, 10 o'clock.
[178:01.37]This is where shit is the fan.
[178:04.61]Somebody took him.
[178:07.17]Nah, I don't think so.
[178:14.54]Too much for me.
[178:17.24]And with that.
[178:19.27]Thank you everybody for coming out for this shorter stream at night.
[178:23.79]Stream in the morning and we stream at night.
[178:27.36]Hope you had some fun.
[178:32.68]So let's talk about the game plan.
[178:36.87]I didn't need to turn this on.
[178:43.84]Game plan is nothing tomorrow.
[178:47.12]And we're just going to go with the normal summer schedule here.
[178:50.62]So you can expect to see me Friday and Saturday.
[178:55.67]And probably, you know, there's a lot to do.
[179:00.45]So I might expect Friday is like the next scheduled stream, but I might do a thing here where it's maybe Thursday, Friday, Sunday, or Friday, Sunday, Monday, something like that.
[179:14.84]Because there's a lot of stuff we have to do.
[179:16.20]If Dark Souls Remastered, I want to start.
[179:18.48]Destroy All Humans, I want to keep going through that, especially the second one.
[179:23.92]uh those are going to be at least three to four streams each Dark Souls remastered is gonna I'm gonna beat the whole thing as much as I can right so I got a feeling that will be at least a couple weeks worth of streams so we should have a lot of fun doing that but uh I will let you know just look the market on your calendar for Friday and if something happens else in between I will definitely let you know
[179:53.29]Hope you enjoyed the E3 conferences.

[183:31.61]Bro, look, thanks for the $1.
[183:33.67]Here is my Ethereum address.
[183:35.19]If you want a potential alternative to something like PayPal, here you go.
[183:40.33]No, my Ethereum address that I never deleted.
[183:44.45]Yeah.
[183:45.55]It's there.
[183:47.77]Thanks for all that.
[183:49.05]Thank you Stix Renegade for the one dollar.
[183:50.57]Jerma Expensive truly shows your master skill at the fine arts.
[183:53.97]I would like to commission you to draw my fursona.
[183:58.00]That's more than a dollar.
[184:00.06]For me to draw your fursona would be at least one and a half of those.
[184:04.22]Why are you guys spamming my Ethereum address?
[184:09.60]Why is that a joke now?
[184:13.51]My copypasta should not... You shouldn't do like a copypasta with my F address.
[184:22.62]Anywho.
[184:24.70]Thank you, Stix.
[184:25.92]Thank you, SirFeline, for the $1.
[184:27.16]Why does jermaJex kind of look like a troll face?
[184:35.15]I'm gonna, like, contact Blordow and be like, alright, can we, like, extend his chin out and, like, close his lips just a little so people aren't gonna, like, spam my Ethereum troll face?
[184:51.68]But thanks, Freeline.
[184:53.14]Thank you, Snooze and Copter, for the $1.
[184:54.52]We got Emotions Origins for the planet emotes.
[184:58.18]Which emotion is Jerma Merc?
[185:00.52]Now.
[185:01.57]I love this emote to death.
[185:02.73]That's, like, smug.
[185:05.61]You know, super confident butt chin.
[185:09.13]Looking to the side and kind of down like... That is smugness.
[185:13.60]That is scoffing.
[185:14.40]That is... Just like what you think.
[185:18.34]You think that you can do this to me?
[185:21.26]You think that I'm not gonna... You think I'm not capable of that?
[185:30.23]Jerma smug.
[185:31.85]Jerma Thanos.
[185:34.13]It really is.
[185:34.81]That's funny.
[185:37.86]I love the new emotes.
[185:38.44]Um... I mean, Resident Evil 7 is awesome in PSVR.
[185:41.80]That's the best one, I think.
[185:44.06]Besides that... Um, what were some other good PSVR games that I played?
[186:10.61]There's a lot of random PS4, yeah, what was them?
[186:17.17]Good, good, you don't spam my Ethereum address.
[186:20.87]Good, I don't keep putting, spam it.
[186:23.25]Then more people will see it.
[186:24.81]And more people might get interested.
[186:27.81]And then maybe those people will look into what Ethereum is.
[186:30.48]Look into what, you know, the blockchain is.
[186:32.06]Maybe they'll get interested.
[186:33.88]Maybe they'll put $285 into the space like I have.
[186:39.09]You know, maybe they'll put down like $277 like I did and be really invested in the system.
[186:58.61]Fucking troll face.
[187:03.89]Ugh.
[187:06.70]But yeah, Resident Evil 7 is the best one I can give you.
[187:13.27]Thank you GarfieldTheMondayKiller for the one dollar.
[187:16.19]Garfield's coming at you live from Disney World.
[187:19.19]They got a show with the actual Muppets every half hour.
[187:22.13]Seeing a Muppet up close is Garfield of Garfed Up.
[187:25.63]Meanwhile, Universal just made a Jimmy Fallon ride where all he does is spout memes and numbers from his show.
[187:33.81]I don't know.
[187:35.23]John seemed to like it.
[187:36.73]I'm glad the rest of the park is more like Disney and doesn't pander as much.
[187:41.89]There was a Star Wars light and fireworks show that I'm sure you'd like.
[187:45.30]Speaking of Disney, what's your favorite Disney movie?
[187:47.48]Alright.
[187:50.48]Anybody else love the fact that Garfield... So Garfield gives us like these paragraphs of LARPing and then a like actual legitimate question in the last sentence.
[188:04.77]Actual question hidden in the Garfield paragraph My favorite Disney movie is probably Deadpool 2 Thank You Son of Jenova for the $1 hi Jermbo is this supposed to be a cigarette Also, you don't like Jerma mark
[188:31.65]No, it's a finger.
[188:33.88]Like, don't, look.
[188:35.78]You see, like, hold on.
[188:38.38]This shit, it's like, you know, like, like, fucking blew that out.
[188:43.54]That's what it's supposed to be.
[188:44.86]And it's shaped like a J. It's a J with, like, the, the, no, like the, because I'm going the other way.
[188:51.35]I'm mirrored.
[188:57.65]That's not Disney?
[188:58.29]Yes, it is.
[188:59.57]Deadpool 2 is a Disney movie.
[189:02.12]Sorry, but it is.
[189:11.47]Yeah, the sync is off because I had to do the... That's the way... I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[189:18.21]I didn't switch it from this morning.
[189:20.43]From the Nintendo conference.
[189:29.64]Disney owned is not Disney made.
[189:31.28]They still get to stamp their name on it.
[189:34.72]It's still a Disney movie.
[189:42.13]No, but for real though, my favorite Disney movie, like actual Disney movie is probably, if it's not something like, I would say Hercules is one of my favorites.
[189:49.65]And Beauty and the Beast, the original.
[189:56.80]And
[190:08.99]That'd be the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
[190:12.53]If I had to give a top three, like favorite Disney animated films.
[190:27.31]Not Frozen, no.
[190:28.37]Frozen was, no.
[190:34.08]Hunchback was dark for a Disney movie.
[190:37.50]Yeah, but it was still, it was a good movie though.
[190:41.14]Do I think a Ratatouille video game exists?
[190:42.98]Yes, of course.
[190:43.68]Every video game, there's a correlation.
[190:46.08]Every single movie that was a movie for kids or an animated movie has a counterpart that is a video game.
[190:51.44]Almost every single one.
[190:52.43]So, of course there is.
[190:56.65]But thank you to Dr. Drosophilia for the $1.
[191:03.71]Dear Jimmy, I'm writing to let you know that you have two very outstanding individuals in your chat.
[191:10.96]Jack Snow and CRISPR informed a co-op Jupiter a mere seven seconds after my request.
[191:17.23]I bet even you couldn't make a juke that quickly since your reaction time has likely degraded significantly due to your old age.
[191:27.19]Regards.
[191:27.97]Thanks.
[191:30.19]Some of you guys have these macros set up that are just ready to go.
[191:37.54]I applaud you.
[191:40.37]Thank you, bro.
[191:40.79]Look for the $1.
[191:41.51]Can't wait for the stream, dude.
[191:42.65]Thanks, man.
[191:44.21]Wait, what?
[191:45.49]Chunky Bologna, thanks for the $15.
[191:47.45]15 bucks, Chunky Bologna.
[191:50.65]This is one of my favorite games ever.
[191:52.21]So happy to see you play it.
[191:54.35]If you want to beat the whole thing, it takes about 20 hours to finish the missions and take over everything.
[192:01.82]By the way, you had the wrong screen up for like five minutes.
[192:08.88]I'm sorry.
[192:10.17]But thank you.
[192:10.87]That was a fun game.
[192:12.35]That one's going onto the shelf.
[192:13.95]Because I had fun.
[192:17.69]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[192:19.11]Of course you start driving on the wrong side of the road again.
[192:21.13]It's just a habit.
[192:21.83]I have to.
[192:23.43]Thank you, Broluck, again for the $1.
[192:24.85]Sonic the Henchman.
[192:29.02]Thank you.
[192:31.00]Official EFJ.
[192:32.58]Thanks for the $2.
[192:34.68]No message, but appreciate it.
[192:35.96]Thank you, man.
[192:37.59]Darkstar7000, thanks for the $1.
[192:39.67]Hey there, Jeremiah.
[192:40.25]Wanted to update you on the job.
[192:43.27]Without bragging, I'll simply say that I got a surprising chunk of change for the small amount of time I worked.
[192:49.89]I'm so glad I quit that Dunkin' Donuts job the first day.
[192:54.38]God bless.
[192:57.20]Making a chunk of change?
[193:00.56]Good for you, dude.
[193:03.76]Make some money.
[193:05.72]Store it.
[193:08.41]Keep it.
[193:09.69]Don't buy a bunch of nonsense.
[193:11.61]Hold on to it.
[193:15.12]Put it under your bed in a briefcase.
[193:19.10]Buy like four bricks of gold and just put them in your bathroom somewhere where no one's going to look.
[193:26.08]Put them in your bathroom behind, you know, you got like the cabinet in the bathroom that has the towels in it behind the towels.
[193:34.03]No one's going in there to find your gold.
[193:37.05]They haven't done it for me, so why would they do it for you?
[193:41.47]Just have your toilet be crafted out of gold, and then you can just know where it is at all times.
[193:47.83]Gold doesn't retain value.
[193:52.51]Yeah, we'll see.
[193:53.79]We'll see when the zombie apocalypse happens.
[193:55.86]And everybody's looking for gold, and I got all the gold.
[193:57.92]And guess what?
[194:00.30]You can use that as a weapon, too.
[194:01.62]I can bash your head in.
[194:09.21]But congratulations, Darkstar.
[194:13.91]Glad you're doing well.
[194:16.53]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[194:17.79]They just say, ooh, with a bunch of O's.
[194:20.96]Zarina, Alexandra, thanks for the $1.
[194:23.14]Tonight, a horrid tragedy.
[194:25.50]After local streamers spoiled the end of the First World War for millions of schoolchildren, many took to taking their own lives.
[194:33.38]The streets were littered with corpses, and one can only say, why, Jeremy, why?
[194:42.01]That took a really, really extreme turn that I wasn't prepared for.
[194:45.86]I was not prepared for that.
[194:55.82]Troll.
[194:58.25]Every time I look over and I see the troll face, it just makes me unimaginably angry.
[195:06.15]This fucking like... I can't even do my own emote.
[195:10.37]Why?
[195:11.89]Why am I not allowed to do my own emote?
[195:13.99]I just tried to do my own emote.
[195:15.13]It's not there.
[195:15.57]Oh, it's still on the game screen.
[195:23.54]Whoops.
[195:27.68]It's staying.
[195:28.40]Fuck it.
[195:30.02]Yeah, I'm not going to take it off.
[195:33.10]Thank you, Serena.
[195:35.72]Thank you, Convo Breaker, for the $1.
[195:37.54]Paint is a low-cost marking and has been in widespread use since approximately the early 1950s.
[195:45.82]Meaning you were right the first time and are also a genius and the game is wrong.
[195:53.74]What are you referring to?
[195:56.66]Paint is a low-cost marking and has been in widespread use since approximately the 1950s.
[196:01.81]Oh, the lines on the road.
[196:03.71]Okay, so I was right.
[196:05.17]I get it.
[196:05.43]Okay.
[196:10.51]Yeah, alright, so that... Thank you.
[196:14.30]Appreciate that combo.
[196:16.72]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[196:17.84]This game is awesome.
[196:18.64]I used to play it a lot when I was a kid.
[196:19.92]Also, could you say hi to Mika and Marta the Rat?
[196:24.26]Thanks.
[196:25.66]Love you.
[196:27.50]Hi, Mika and Marta the Rat.
[196:32.67]They watching the stream too?
[196:33.83]They got about on the couch and they're kind of like running around, sneaking around and getting in the cracks.
[196:42.49]Apparently rats are really good pets.
[196:45.57]Rats are like a combination of a ferret, a dog, and a cat in the same animal.
[196:49.84]They're apparently really fun.
[196:54.86]But thank you, Sanjinova.
[197:01.05]Thank you, SirFeline, for the five dollars.
[197:04.73]Found what I thought would be a great coffee pasta on the subreddit, Jerma.
[197:08.10]I'll give you five times my normal donation because of how painful this will be for you.
[197:12.50]It will be my next donation.
[197:16.92]Wait, I don't understand.
[197:17.72]What do you mean?
[197:20.44]I need to read this and you're gonna give me five times... You're gonna give me... five times five dollars.
[197:30.97]I'm going to get $25 from you.
[197:34.25]Okay, you got it.
[197:36.63]It's the next one after this one.
[197:37.79]Casey, thanks for the $1.
[197:40.79]If Jif is Coke and Skippy is Pepsi, what is the RC Cola of peanut butter brands?
[197:46.76]Whatever your local grocery store brand is.
[197:50.96]You know, like the CVS brand is what it would be.
[197:55.75]Okay, here it is.
[197:56.21]So I'm going to get $25 if I read this.
[198:00.07]The whole thing, okay?
[198:03.09]Thank you, SirFeline, first, for your one dollar here, and, uh, it's... Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[198:11.89]Welcome to episode one of JomaCraft.
[198:15.05]With the series when I play Minecraft, this is gonna be a single-player Let's Play.
[198:21.03]And what I've saved... This is for $25, guys.
[198:31.40]Would you do this for $25?
[198:37.49]We're halfway through.
[198:38.43]Halfway.
[198:46.63]And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely.
[198:50.82]Because I'm an idiot in this game.
[198:53.52]You're going to see lots of fails.
[198:55.64]You're going to see lots of triumphs.
[198:57.90]At least I'm hoping.
[199:08.25]So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.
[199:11.15]Hot cup of cocoa.
[199:13.91]Got it.
[199:14.67]It's my $25.
[199:15.19]I just made it.
[199:16.49]That's it.
[199:20.85]That's the whole thing.
[199:22.47]I just did that for $25.
[199:28.83]I'm not proud of myself at all.
[199:31.71]In fact, delete that.
[199:33.95]Get rid of that.
[199:34.41]Delete that from the internet.
[199:36.23]I don't want anybody to see that on the internet.
[199:37.67]You know what I mean?
[199:38.84]Get rid of that.
[199:41.66]He left.
[199:44.62]He's gone.
[199:46.00]He's gone.
[199:49.38]He meant $5?
[199:50.18]What are you talking about?
[199:56.11]He said, found what I thought would be a great coffee poster on the subreddit.
[199:59.23]I'll give you five times my normal donation.
[200:03.44]Oh, his normal donation is a dollar, and I got... I reverse-jebaited myself.
[200:10.71]That was for five bucks.
[200:15.33]Met five times, one dollar, so five dollars.
[200:17.47]There it is, five dollars from Sir Feline.
[200:22.49]Well, it's alright, I'll take it.
[200:24.93]Thank you, Sir Feline.
[200:26.99]Appreciate that, dude.
[200:28.94]Assumptions.
[200:30.44]That's why we gotta have this shit in writing, man.
[200:42.45]Anyways.
[200:47.77]Let's go to Bobboy.
[200:54.45]Bobboy, thank you for the five, six dollars here?
[200:59.70]Seven bucks just about.
[201:00.64]Thank you for the seven dollars, Bobboy.
[201:03.20]Please finish Half-Life 2 in your free time.
[201:05.00]You don't want to stream it.
[201:05.88]That's fine.
[201:07.76]I feel like you're missing out if you don't finish it.
[201:10.39]I've actually seen Half-Life 2 played
[201:14.33]When I was in college, I watched people play it.
[201:16.93]I've experienced most of everything in the game.
[201:19.31]Except for, like, six... There's, like, a 70% part.
[201:22.94]Like, 60% of the way.
[201:23.98]Halfway or so.
[201:25.12]Maybe a little bit more.
[201:26.56]Where I didn't see for, like, an hour or two.
[201:28.72]And then I saw the end.
[201:29.72]I saw when G-Man comes out.
[201:32.46]He goes, Mr. Rayman.
[201:36.20]And then you, like, the train explodes.
[201:38.05]And you get off the train.
[201:38.73]And where am I?
[201:40.03]You look around.
[201:40.37]You get the portal gun.
[201:41.09]I've seen it.
[201:50.56]Spoilers Yeah, and we also got some snack advice from Bob boy, okay Get some chocolate numenos and a glass of milk Just full enough to cover the cookie fully side up now this takes a while, but trust me It's worth it one at a time hold the cookies in the milk until they sink to the bottom on their own cram as many as you like in there then put the cup in the fridge for 20 to 40 minutes
[202:20.58]The longer, the better.
[202:22.54]But I suppose only about five minutes is long enough to work.
[202:25.84]Once you're done waiting for the cookies, get a spoon to dig them out.
[202:28.54]It's so good.
[202:32.52]That is a deep... That's a deep amount of work.
[202:40.75]That's a lot of snack work.
[202:45.95]Oh, so drink the milk before getting the cookies out.
[202:48.43]Oh wait, so you- Okay, so you get the- That's- That'd be like a- You'd have like a cookie- That's a cookie sludge at the bottom of your cup, right?
[202:58.97]How did you even get to that point?
[203:04.15]Like, what makes you- What goes around- What makes you go like, You know what?
[203:06.75]I got an idea.
[203:07.33]I'm gonna make an Oreo cookie mud pie.
[203:14.66]How is putting milk... Hold on a second.
[203:18.54]How is putting Oreos in milk and waiting for 30 minutes a lot of work?
[203:23.50]Well, you just said it right there.
[203:27.23]The 30 minute part.
[203:29.75]You know, you're talking about if I want a snack, I want like something right.
[203:32.93]Give me the bag of Doritos.
[203:34.09]Open it.
[203:34.91]Eat.
[203:36.29]I got to work for it.
[203:36.87]I got to like tend my garden to have a snack.
[203:39.96]I just want to open up the bag and just eat them.
[203:48.80]I'm gonna try that.
[203:49.60]I'll come back to you and let you know.
[203:56.70]Nothing better than digging it out of a cup.
[203:59.87]But thank you, Bobboy, for your just under $7 there.
[204:02.49]Thanks, man.
[204:04.01]Darkstar, thanks for the $1, Darkstar.
[204:05.89]I got this game for my brother who was obsessed with The Sopranos last Christmas.
[204:10.49]It was really just a gag gift, but the madman played through the entire thing and he loved it.
[204:20.05]Well, I mean, if I was, I'm not like a huge fan of The Sopranos.
[204:23.89]I mean, it's a great show.
[204:28.27]But if you're a huge fan of anything, getting more of that thing is always a good thing.
[204:34.02]Because you get to have more of it.
[204:36.32]You get to hear Pauly say more lines than just the stuff that's in the TV show.
[204:41.94]That's why I'm a huge Game of Thrones fan.
[204:44.79]And, you know, the movies, the books, not the movies, the TV show, the books and all that stuff, the video games, the Telltale video game, I was like that.
[204:54.91]I couldn't wait for it.
[204:56.13]It was like, give me, please put it in my hands, I can't wait to play it.
[204:59.35]And it came out, and it was by a million margins, one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a video game.
[205:08.84]So...
[205:10.46]I mean, sometimes it doesn't work out that way, even things that you love so much.
[205:20.41]So let me, like, completely go against everything I just said.
[205:24.77]I'm glad your brother likes The Sopranos, and I'm glad he got through it.
[205:32.25]Thank you, VATS, for the two bucks.
[205:34.65]Thanks for keeping me company on my break.
[205:36.41]Now back to my 12-hour shift.
[205:38.28]Damn.
[205:39.80]Also, with the summer schedule, does that mean that streams will be longer?
[205:44.92]Yeah, I mean, I've tried to... I've been trying to increase the stream lengths lately.
[205:53.08]The last at least three or four months.
[205:55.56]Trying to at least go for five plus hours of stream.
[206:01.63]And you might be saying, well, you've only been streaming for like three hours, three and a half hours tonight.
[206:05.65]I mean, if you count earlier today, this would be about five to six hours for the day, right?
[206:14.43]I used to only go for like two and a half to four.
[206:16.75]I'm trying to push to like five to seven.
[206:22.82]So technically, yes.
[206:26.82]Thank you, Vets, for the two bucks.
[206:30.46]Thank you, Neo Gore, for the $1.
[206:31.94]No message.
[206:33.04]Thank you.
[206:33.86]Zero Coal, thanks for the $1.
[206:37.05]Note, please only utilize this payment method if you have a basic understanding of how cryptocurrency works.
[206:42.15]Also note, these donations will not show up on screen during a stream.
[206:44.91]Thank you for even considering.
[206:47.52]Well, you know why that's there, right?
[206:50.27]Because sending a payment, sending an Ethereum transaction to somebody that doesn't know what they're doing, you could lose all your fucking money.
[206:59.92]You could send it to the wrong address somehow, if you don't know what's going on, and it's gone, and you'll never get it back.
[207:07.13]It's not, hey, I sent that to the wrong address, can I get that money back?
[207:11.47]Nope.
[207:12.19]It's gone forever, and you will never get it back.
[207:14.53]So that's why you have to, I have to put that note there.
[207:17.79]Because if you don't understand the process of how that works, then I don't want to give somebody a possibility to be like, Oh, he wants me to give Ethereum?
[207:24.15]I better give him a dickload of it right now.
[207:26.16]How do I do this?
[207:26.90]It's kind of complicated.
[207:28.08]Fuck it.
[207:28.52]Send.
[207:29.56]Oh, he's going to be so happy that he got like five grand in Ethereum.
[207:33.38]What happened?
[207:35.72]I gave it to some random guy and I'll never get it back.
[207:38.75]Oh.
[207:41.55]We had this talk.
[207:42.35]I know, but you have to have the talk again sometimes.
[207:44.83]Because remember...
[207:47.70]How many people are here?
[207:48.28]There's like just under a thousand people here, right?
[207:55.86]It's not the same people every stream.
[207:58.70]So if I say like something and we talk about something, then like two or three weeks later, it's not the same.
[208:03.96]You're not the same people that were here like three weeks ago.
[208:07.65]A lot of you were here.
[208:14.90]Okay, how many people put right?
[208:17.46]Wait, hold on a second.
[208:18.76]I need to know this.
[208:19.54]This is a good experiment anyways.
[208:21.95]Don't lie to me.
[208:23.31]Tell me the truth.
[208:23.77]I'm going to give you a poll.
[208:28.93]This is just, I want to know.
[208:31.13]From my own NSA steal information demographics.
[208:37.43]Okay, this is... Were you at the stream on Monday?
[208:44.90]Were you at the stream?
[208:46.70]No, there was no stream on Monday.
[208:49.12]Sunday.
[208:50.70]Were you at Sunday's stream?
[208:55.30]Just literally two days ago.
[209:01.64]There you go.
[209:02.76]Were you at Sunday's stream?
[209:06.25]And I want you to tell me the truth.
[209:11.85]Come on.
[209:13.03]There we go.
[209:15.96]That was the E3 stream, yeah.
[209:19.28]Sunday was the E3 conferences and Destroy All Humans.
[209:28.84]Alright, so as we go here, you'll see that about 32% of everybody in this chat was not here on Sunday.
[209:36.83]So, whatever I said on Sunday, no matter what it is, 30% of you didn't hear it.
[209:43.60]You know, you might be hearing it for the first time.
[209:45.14]Maybe you didn't even know that I was streaming on Sunday.
[209:48.14]Oh, shit, you streamed on Sunday.
[209:49.26]Yeah, whatever.
[209:49.54]So, you know what I mean?
[209:55.38]So, you know, sometimes you get asked questions about something that you talked about, like, weeks ago or months ago.
[210:02.61]I mean, Jeremy, what's going on?
[210:03.95]Are you still having a baby on stream?
[210:07.19]Oh, no, no.
[210:08.83]Shit, I gotta talk about that.
[210:10.01]You know, it's 30%.
[210:15.07]What if we don't remember?
[210:22.76]The stream where I almost missed 30 minutes of the show.
[210:24.72]What do you mean?
[210:25.46]I started right at the Xbox conference.
[210:33.92]The Xbox conference was exactly when I turned on the stream.
[210:39.46]But that's interesting for me to know, just out of curiosity.
[210:45.84]Anyways, almost done here.
[210:47.06]Wrapping it up.
[210:48.92]Brolock, thanks again for the $1.
[210:50.40]It's my Ethereum address.
[210:51.46]That's the latest in copy-paste memes that we're utilizing here.
[210:59.60]Thank you.
[211:01.84]Trodungle, thanks for the $1.
[211:03.08]Hey, Jerma, I know you.
[211:06.86]How are you?
[211:07.30]How you doing?
[211:08.48]Good to know you.
[211:10.68]Good to know you.
[211:16.33]Uh, thank you Trodungle again for the one dollar.
[211:19.47]God fucking dammit, I was gonna ask a real question about the problems of power consumption in Bitcoin mining and its ill effects for the environment, but then I accidentally hit enter and left an incredibly disconcerting bit donation.
[211:33.50]I had to buy more bits just to clear this up so I don't become the guy who accidentally posted a bit donation too.
[211:41.16]Alright, well, that's a really good clarification.
[211:44.16]Because, hey, Jerma, I know you.
[211:46.66]Is... I would say in the same ballpark as, hey, Jerma, look out the window and you're out there standing.
[211:54.81]Hey.
[211:56.51]I know you.
[211:59.16]You do?
[211:59.80]Alright.
[212:03.90]But, to answer your question, Jero, that's what proof of stake and...
[212:08.80]Some of the other scaling solutions are for.
[212:10.54]Not everything has to be proof of work.
[212:14.74]They're proof of capacity.
[212:17.11]There's other things in that space that will solve some of those problems.
[212:26.97]Don't look behind you.
[212:29.15]I won't.
[212:31.75]But thank you, Troy Dungle.
[212:33.08]Thank you, Torxdra, for the $1.00.
[212:36.39]And Trodungle again for the $1.
[212:37.80]And he just says early.
[212:40.48]So his last message was, who accidentally posted a bit donation too, and the next one's early.
[212:45.80]That's his next joke.
[212:51.62]That's his next joke.
[212:52.69]That's part of his routine.
[213:01.71]Thank you NullScore for the $1.
[213:03.35]Hey, Jerma just got here.
[213:04.75]So I don't know if you already covered this.
[213:07.81]Hey, hold on a minute.
[213:10.25]Thank you for even saying that, because thank- You just- you just gave me all the fuel for the last 20 minutes.
[213:19.85]Hey Jerma, just got here, so I don't know if you've already covered this.
[213:23.53]Dot dot dot dot dot dot dot.
[213:25.69]But when you play Dark Souls, if you're playing it on PC, you'd be better off playing the Prepare to Die edition with the DS fix.
[213:33.56]And the connectivity mod.
[213:35.62]Rather than the remaster.
[213:36.82]Obviously, it's up to you, but as I understand, the PC remaster is full of hackers and mega-ganks.
[213:46.58]I will be playing the remaster.
[213:50.96]Just because I want to play the latest version of the game.
[213:58.58]And I'm probably going to play the game offline.
[214:02.75]So...
[214:04.36]I don't have to worry about that.
[214:09.20]Remaster is active.
[214:11.42]What?
[214:13.76]Remaster will be active.
[214:19.26]Play the remaster on a console?
[214:21.11]Why would a console fix that?
[214:26.77]Hackers, I guess you can't.
[214:29.13]I guess that's true.
[214:31.29]Should I play it on PS4?
[214:36.95]Yeah, active player base.
[214:41.35]PC with controller is the best.
[214:43.11]Okay, does it run at 60 on the PlayStation 4?
[214:52.25]I don't have a PS4 Pro, so... Is it gonna be, like, the same experience either way?
[215:01.92]PS4 at 60 FPS?
[215:02.26]Okay.
[215:07.85]There's motion blur though.
[215:15.36]Runs well.
[215:18.48]That's going to be kind of a... I'm going to have to figure that out.
[215:24.16]You can't turn off the motion blur.
[215:26.33]So it's either play the game online with motion blur, or play the game offline without motion blur and the best fidelity, but...
[215:36.98]Turn it on, the online mode, and face hackers, probably.
[215:45.61]So, I guess the question is, do I want to have the game be online to experience the whole thing online?
[215:52.93]Or just play the game offline on PC?
[215:56.16]That's a game time decision.
[215:57.28]I'm not sure.
[216:03.76]But...
[216:05.15]uh thank you for the information and the tips appreciate that a lot if you play the remaster online on pc you will pretty much lose save files and our hackers can get you banned from the game yeah I saw that I heard about people talking about that do password online I probably will just play it on pc
[216:36.11]I mean, are the chances that high that someone's gonna get into my game and hack me and I'm gonna lose everything?
[216:42.15]I mean, there are probably millions of people playing this game right now.
[216:45.47]At least thousands.
[216:49.00]Stream snipers, I mean, whatever.
[216:56.04]It's very high.
[216:57.16]Okay, so... Yes, they're going to target me.
[217:01.75]Alright, well, hey, the PlayStation 4 is a great system, apparently.
[217:08.74]Well, alrighty, well, we'll see.
[217:14.24]But, thank you.
[217:15.16]Thank you, uh, Niall, uh, Nilathoa for the $5.
[217:18.64]They say Minecraft.
[217:20.56]Thank you for the $5, and the Minecraft donation.
[217:25.42]Sir Feline, thanks for the $5.
[217:26.40]You gave it earlier, talking about how it was your, um, not $25, but $5.
[217:33.34]Thanks for that.
[217:40.04]This is going to be a disaster.
[217:45.25]Just stay not human.
[217:48.31]I kind of like the idea of people invading, though.
[217:50.05]It makes it fun.
[217:50.71]It makes it interesting.
[217:51.69]You can turn it off if you want and just play the game.
[217:57.87]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[217:59.29]Hey, Jerma, thanks for the two-stream combo today.
[218:01.61]You're spoiling us.
[218:03.85]I really hope you go back to the Godfather game.
[218:05.85]I really was enjoying that one.
[218:07.01]It's like GTA, but in the 1930s or so.
[218:10.07]Loving the PS2 games so far.
[218:11.85]Looking forward to the rest.
[218:12.65]If there's more, can't wait for Dreamcast as well.
[218:16.72]Take care.
[218:18.88]Thank you, Dr. Clay.
[218:20.56]And yes, there are plenty.
[218:23.30]There are probably at least 10 to 15 games sitting over here that we haven't played.
[218:31.49]And yes, Dreamcast as well.
[218:33.21]But that's for another day.
[218:36.97]Thank you, SirFeline, for the one dollar.
[218:38.88]Two dollars, actually, in a row.
[218:41.06]In other words, Jerma, what can I say?
[218:42.66]I don't know, but, you know, I got places to be.
[218:46.72]I gotta go to work.
[218:49.52]Thank you, SirFeline, again.
[218:51.52]Also, Jerma, if you add up my donations from the past couple of streams, you've made far more than $25.
[218:55.27]Also, jermaJex.
[219:05.67]Why are we counting?
[219:06.65]Why are we counting?
[219:07.39]Excuse me.
[219:11.45]Excuse me.
[219:15.41]Excuse me.
[219:22.14]Thank you, feline.
[219:22.80]Thank you, Bobboy, for the $2.50.
[219:28.23]You say it's not a mud pie.
[219:30.51]Newman O's middle cream is structured enough...
[219:33.82]that the cookie biscuit bit is full of milk while the cream is still as soft and undeformed as when you started.
[219:42.12]Honestly, if you can use the spoon to pick out the cookies one by one and eat them as such, it's worth it.
[219:50.12]I will... I will give it a try.
[219:51.71]I will take your word for it, because you sound like a cookie scientist.
[219:55.39]And I will take it seriously.
[220:00.01]But thanks, man.
[220:00.57]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the five dollars.
[220:03.58]No, you didn't have to give me another $5, feline.
[220:06.98]And now I have to read this.
[220:08.22]And now I understand why you gave this extra little bit of bits here.
[220:12.41]Because you say, Thank you very much, Jeremy.
[220:17.17]I have now donated the total $25 as requested for you to weave your upcoming OWO craft streams.
[220:29.72]Thanks, man.
[220:34.98]Thank you for that.
[220:36.42]Thanks for the $26 total.
[220:43.93]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[220:44.87]Hey, Jeremiah, I'm outside your window.
[220:46.25]Keep in mind, I'm all the way in Australia, so you might not see me.
[220:51.19]I like that.
[220:51.53]That's a good one.
[220:53.48]Thank you, CheezitChrist, for the $1.
[220:56.64]Save the polar bears.
[220:57.70]That's a good cause.
[220:58.50]I agree.
[220:59.93]Uh, Investigate 311, thanks for the $1.
[221:02.15]Hey Jeremy, it's your buddy Kanye West.
[221:04.36]Thanks for keeping it, uh, thanks for keeping it wavy?
[221:09.18]PS Kaka is stored in the butt cheeks.
[221:13.10]God bless you.
[221:13.78]God bless you too.
[221:14.76]Thank you.
[221:15.98]Uh, Ermine, thanks for the $5.
[221:17.14]Ermine762.
[221:20.88]How much would I have to pay you to buy some pet rats and have a rat camp?
[221:32.60]Um, no, I can't.
[221:33.70]I'm moving.
[221:35.66]I can't have any more animals.
[221:38.48]I'm moving across the country in less than a couple months, so I can't have any more small animals.
[221:47.07]As much as I would love to.
[221:49.75]Thank you, Irmai, for the five bucks.
[221:52.43]And finally, to wrap it up here, SirFeline, for the one dollar, I'm sorry for torturing you, Jerma.
[221:56.23]Feels bad, man.
[221:58.11]No, it's all in good fun.
[222:01.20]Thank you, SirFeline.
[222:03.13]It's only good fun.
[222:05.25]And that's it.
[222:06.39]I will see you guys definitely on Friday.
[222:08.62]Maybe more.
[222:09.38]Maybe less.
[222:10.32]But plan on Friday.
[222:13.10]Got a lot of shit to do.
[222:16.28]There might even be a couple of surprises.
[222:18.22]There might even be a surprise.
[222:21.73]There might be something that happens that you might not know is going to happen.
[222:25.83]Maybe.
[222:25.95]Maybe.
[222:27.49]But, goodnight.
[222:28.57]And thank you, Smelly Boy, for the $1.
[222:30.29]What would you do if you were playing the new Smash Bros.
[222:32.04]and the default me face was the life is pain face?
[222:36.08]What would a legitimate reaction be?
[222:39.14]That's easy.
[222:40.56]Where's my money?
[222:43.74]It'd be very, very simple.
[222:44.84]It'd be like, Nintendo, where's my money?
[222:49.91]Because if I don't open up my mailbox and there's a check for $16,945...
[222:56.91]then I'm going to lawyer up.
[223:00.09]And we're going in there together.
[223:02.51]Me and my like $14 an hour lawyer that I found from the Yellow Pages.
[223:13.72]Thank you, Stapler, for the $1.
[223:15.38]Hey, Jim, a big fan.
[223:16.16]Just going to get straight to the point on this one.
[223:17.67]What would you do if we kissed on the bus?
[223:21.93]On the battle bus.
[223:22.77]What is this?
[223:26.02]Is that a Fortnite thing?
[223:27.24]You're doing a Fortnite meme here?
[223:29.58]That's what it is.
[223:30.06]You're doing a... You're Fortnite-ing me.
[223:31.22]Alright.
[223:36.64]Good night, everybody.
[223:37.62]I'll see you soon.
[223:38.66]Take care.
[223:40.58]Brush your teeth.
[224:00.25]you
