[00:03.03]I'm on time.
[00:04.65]We're waiting pa- I'm on time.
[00:06.03]I'm here.
[00:11.23]I pressed the button at 2 o'clock.
[00:14.01]It took an extra 45 seconds to get through the internet tubes, okay?
[00:19.98]You understand the remarkable tech- My throat is all spurred up.
[00:24.26]Let me be honest with you.
[00:27.00]Ugh.
[00:28.45]Well, my nose is.
[00:29.17]Gotta figure out what's going on inside the, uh, inside the nasal passages here.
[00:34.03]Some of you know, I've had some nasal problems over the last six months or so, last few months at least.
[00:40.61]Just got, I just went to the doctor recently again.
[00:42.99]Probably why my nose is irritated.
[00:48.81]I've got these annoying things that I have to deal with, and it's stupid.
[00:55.32]It's stupid.
[00:57.95]Anyways, how you doing?
[00:59.01]He's drunk.
[01:00.77]Ah, by the way, I drank a fucking pint.
[01:06.88]This guy's, it's too much cocaine.
[01:11.20]No.
[01:16.88]I've, I just, no.
[01:18.62]God.
[01:20.38]Alright, let me tweet.
[01:20.90]We're gonna do some tier lists today.
[01:23.20]And some browser, uh, just stuff.
[01:28.85]We're going to do, essentially what we're doing today.
[01:31.63]You know what?
[01:32.13]I'll tell you in a minute.
[01:33.10]I'll tell you in like a minute or two.
[01:34.62]Let me tweet this and I'll be right back.
[02:36.17]It's a boring title.
[02:39.64]What do you want me to have the title?
[02:40.96]What should the title be?
[02:44.30]My titles tell you precisely what is going to happen on this stream.
[02:49.96]It's just quick.
[02:51.78]It's to the point.
[02:52.54]You know what you're going to get, right?
[02:57.87]Facecam?
[02:59.77]I don't know.
[03:00.27]I don't know about today.
[03:02.37]Of course there's going to be a facecam.
[03:04.65]Stop asking for it!
[03:06.41]Stop asking for it!
[03:10.51]Sorry, I just got a little upset about that one.
[03:17.44]I'm in another mood today.
[03:18.78]This is going to be a weird stream.
[03:25.70]I'm already in a... This is two streams in a row where I'm just in one of those moods.
[03:37.14]Did you strangle somebody behind a dumpster?
[03:38.98]No.
[03:41.30]Why would I ever say yes?
[03:46.61]What kind of question?
[03:47.23]Why would I ever say yes to that question?
[03:54.71]Nobody asked that.
[04:01.47]Do I like art?
[04:05.01]Yeah, of course I do.
[04:10.62]Alright, you guys ready?
[04:16.38]Are you ready?
[04:16.74]Hi.
[04:22.09]So, as you see, it's kind of dark in here, isn't it?
[04:27.42]Whatever.
[04:28.30]It's too big.
[04:35.32]Okay, so I have to update my fast food tier list.
[04:40.90]Some of these are updates.
[04:44.99]I've eaten at a lot more of these places, but actually there's still a lot that I have not.
[04:49.45]And pardon my voice.
[04:51.41]Every so often it's going to go with sounds and words coming out, and I'm going to have to go apologize for that.
[05:00.99]You got a haircut?
[05:01.61]When was the last time you guys saw me on camera?
[05:11.72]How long has it been since I've been on camera?
[05:12.88]A couple weeks?
[05:16.24]No, I don't think so.
[05:17.58]Smoker?
[05:18.88]I don't smoke cigarettes.
[05:20.37]I don't smoke anything.
[05:24.97]I need to make it a little... Hold on.
[05:32.84]The brightness has to come up a little bit.
[05:35.72]Right?
[05:37.24]Yeah.
[05:39.06]Yeah, it does.
[05:40.62]Hold on.
[05:43.12]Uh, you look drunk.
[05:43.80]I don't look drunk.
[05:46.80]I don't look drunk.
[05:52.92]Dude, are you drunk?
[05:54.36]I'm not drunk!
[05:55.16]Okay, I want, like, brightness.
[06:08.47]That's better.
[06:09.03]Well, that's kind of weird.
[06:09.95]It looks, like, pixelated, doesn't it?
[06:16.31]Is it better?
[06:16.63]That's a little better, right?
[06:22.75]Okay, I think that's okay for now.
[06:29.41]Alright.
[06:30.84]Okay, I'm done stalling.
[06:36.78]Don't worry, I'm high too.
[06:38.44]I'm not high.
[06:45.30]Put the contrast down or up?
[06:52.76]Okay, we're gonna start.
[06:53.96]I'm gonna update some tier lists.
[06:56.20]Hi, everybody.
[06:57.06]Welcome back.
[06:58.02]Be entertaining.
[07:01.72]The curtain hasn't even gone up yet!
[07:04.04]Relax!
[07:05.34]I just stopped screaming at you.
[07:06.30]Alright, A and W. We're gonna start here.
[07:11.76]A and W.
[07:16.76]I like the root beer, but I've never eaten at an A&W restaurant before.
[07:24.04]But I... Do they even exist?
[07:32.74]Is A&W like Blockbuster?
[07:34.62]Like this one left somewhere?
[07:36.33]Like in the middle of like Ohio or something somewhere?
[07:39.53]Where is it?
[07:41.33]I've never heard of this.
[07:43.85]It's in Canada.
[07:44.57]Canada.
[07:47.20]I think he just woke up.
[07:48.82]I did not just wake up.
[07:50.62]I know I had, look.
[07:54.02]Excuse me.
[07:55.28]I need to tell you this.
[07:56.55]So, over the last, like, few months, whatever.
[07:58.51]You know what I mean?
[07:59.33]Like, okay.
[08:02.13]I have, like, permanent wake-up voice.
[08:05.93]If that makes any sense.
[08:08.09]I have permanent wake-up voice.
[08:10.95]From this nasal shit going on that has not gone away.
[08:17.38]I don't think it's... I'm not getting old.
[08:19.72]I have like these cysts that are in my sinuses.
[08:22.36]There's one... There's one right here in particular.
[08:24.76]Like right there in the back.
[08:26.87]It's like this big or something.
[08:28.91]It's like maybe this.
[08:30.35]Like here.
[08:31.49]Right there.
[08:32.79]Like that.
[08:33.79]Like that.
[08:34.81]They're like these little circles.
[08:38.71]And they're pissing me off.
[08:39.85]They're causing me all kinds of fucking problems.
[08:42.32]Are you pregnant?
[08:44.14]Are you pregnant?
[08:56.02]Arby's sucks.
[08:56.96]I have... I've had it like... I... I... Okay.
[08:59.10]The last time I did this tier list... Uh... I ha... I think I said the same thing.
[09:05.61]I haven't eaten Arby's in a long time.
[09:08.71]I think I've had it one time, and it was the same opinion that I had... When I had it like two years ago.
[09:14.17]Three years ago, right?
[09:16.41]I just don't... I don't like it.
[09:18.55]If I'm... Okay.
[09:19.48]If I'm gonna have a deli sandwich... I'm just gonna... I'm gonna make it at my house.
[09:25.41]If I want like a turkey and cheese deli sandwich, I could just do that at my house.
[09:33.13]That's like the reason why I don't really care about Arby's.
[09:37.39]When I go to like a restaurant, I like to get stuff that I can't really get at my house.
[09:42.30]Stuff that tastes different, is prepared differently, right?
[09:47.70]Maybe it's not, you know, it's probably not fair to put it in poor, because it's just, like, deli sandwiches.
[09:53.78]It's not, like, bad.
[09:54.88]I did just say it sucks, but that's, like, that's fake.
[09:58.89]I didn't mean that.
[10:02.15]Alright, this is, uh... Ob... Ob... Obon Payne.
[10:10.83]I actually have walked, I think, by this restaurant, like, three or four times.
[10:16.00]I think I've seen it on, like, Google Maps.
[10:20.18]I've never eaten here.
[10:27.34]I've, like, opened up, like, Google Maps to look for food, and I've seen it pop up.
[10:34.75]But I've just never... I've just, like, why?
[10:36.03]Uh, Ani-Anne's is...
[10:41.52]I don't like the buttery pretzel.
[10:43.47]I like a hard, like, bronze pretzel on the outside.
[10:47.39]That's kind of crunchy.
[10:49.73]Onions is, like, kind of soft and buttery.
[10:52.29]I don't like... It's more bread than pretzel to me.
[10:55.80]I hope you die.
[10:56.38]Get a load of this guy.
[11:08.35]I like, uh, really like crusty kind of dark pretzel on the outside.
[11:13.82]And Ani-An's is, it's kind of like bread.
[11:17.18]It's not, I know pretzels are bread, I know, I get it.
[11:21.30]But it's like eating bread, not like pretzel bread.
[11:24.89]Does that make any sense?
[11:27.43]I feel like when I go to Ani-An's, I'm eating like a, uh, like a dinner roll, not a pretzel.
[11:33.95]Am I insane?
[11:34.87]I don't think I am.
[11:36.74]I like it, but I'd rather have a different kind of pretzel.
[11:45.21]You have awful taste.
[11:46.55]Oh, just wait till we get Domino's.
[11:50.66]You have no idea.
[11:51.62]It's going S tier.
[11:57.72]Okay, Baja Fresh.
[11:59.08]I've never had it.
[12:02.61]This is Baskin Robbins.
[12:06.12]I'm gonna put Baskin Robbins in good because of one particular I got my fingernails are a little too long I'm gonna put Baskin Robbins up in good because of one type of ice cream they have and that is their mom's making cookies ice cream it's so unbelievably good it's like one of the best ice creams I've ever had in my life I made a tweet about it yeah
[12:31.19]And the tweet, like, sucks.
[12:32.21]I went back and, like, looked at that old, like, tweet, and I was like, this joke sucks, and I wanted to delete it, but I didn't.
[12:38.27]Just keep it there.
[12:40.97]Uh... But yeah, MomsMakingCookies puts this in good.
[12:44.95]This stuff is good there, too.
[12:48.44]I would probably put it here if it wasn't for that one type.
[12:52.89]Now, here's the worst part.
[12:54.03]Actually, I'm considering dropping it down to average.
[12:56.55]And because that shit's not year-round.
[13:00.33]It's like a weird seasonal thing that they put up sometimes.
[13:04.49]It's the best flavor you've ever had.
[13:06.95]You can... Baskin Robbins, listen to me, please, God.
[13:11.39]You can take off, like, strawberry cheesecake...
[13:17.11]You can take off, like, Rocky Road.
[13:20.57]Just put it up there.
[13:23.09]Take off strawberry cheesecake and put this on.
[13:27.27]You know how many times you've gone to, like, Baskin Robbins and there's a tub that, like, had not even been used?
[13:32.85]Like, shit's not even been opened.
[13:34.09]Nobody's ordering it.
[13:35.85]They definitely have data.
[13:37.05]Just take the one that, like, nobody's ordering and fucking just replace it with mom's making cookies permanently.
[13:42.36]I don't know why it's not there permanently.
[13:43.64]It's the best thing they have.
[13:47.42]Okay, strawberry cheesecake was... I mean, that was just me saying a random one.
[13:53.06]I'm just saying.
[13:53.62]There's ones there that have been there forever.
[13:55.40]And I'm going to be... Maybe I'll sound like a weirdo here.
[14:00.24]Why do we have vanilla ice cream still there?
[14:06.14]I don't think I've ordered a just vanilla ice cream in 10 to 15 years.
[14:10.65]Ever.
[14:12.15]Ever.
[14:13.49]When was the last time you ordered just like, oh, yeah, I'll take one scoop of vanilla ice cream, please, from one of these places?
[14:22.34]I mean, like, yeah, everyone, it's good.
[14:23.94]It is good.
[14:24.52]But, like, put it in the back in a freezer.
[14:28.20]There's nobody, people don't order it.
[14:30.14]Who orders a vanilla ice cream?
[14:31.57]You order, like, I want, like, half Oreo cookie.
[14:34.25]I want, like, half cheesecake.
[14:36.05]Nobody gets just vanilla ice cream in a cup.
[14:40.15]This is the worst take?
[14:41.17]I don't think it is.
[14:48.65]You can get vanilla ice cream everywhere.
[14:50.73]Baskin-Robbins, all these, uh, like, craft ice cream places.
[14:54.41]It's like, oh, look at all our crazy craft ice creams.
[14:56.81]And then you got vanilla ice cream just sitting there.
[14:59.44]Not even vanilla bean, by the way.
[15:01.00]Excuse me.
[15:05.87]I can get vanilla ice cream anywhere.
[15:07.05]I tell you, my restaurant opinions are based on getting things that I can't get anywhere else.
[15:13.79]I can't get mom's making cookies anywhere else but Baskin Robbins for like two months out of the year or whatever it is.
[15:19.52]I can get vanilla ice cream in 700 fucking locations within five miles from my current location.
[15:28.84]I don't think I have to explain this.
[15:33.32]It's staying in average.
[15:39.67]I have eaten full tubs of Ben & Jerry's pint ice creams more than like 5,000 to 10,000 times, I think.
[15:46.11]Well, that's way too much.
[15:50.36]Half-baked is the best probably ice cream you can get at any grocery store or any place.
[15:56.14]Half-baked, and Ben & Jerry's does this awesome thing that other ice cream places don't do.
[16:01.82]So Ben & Jerry's does this thing, and I may have had this opinion a few years ago, but I'm going to reiterate it.
[16:08.64]They don't fucking skimp on the cookie dough.
[16:11.96]It's not these little teeny little sand crystals of cookie dough.
[16:16.01]They give you these like gobs of cookie dough.
[16:19.65]Huge chunks of fudge brownie.
[16:22.16]That's why they're up here.
[16:25.49]There's nothing more that I hate than eating a cookie dough ice cream and you get to like the four or five little chunks of cookie dough that are in there and the rest of it is just ice cream and you have like half of your entire treat that is just ice cream and there's no cookie dough left at all.
[16:43.75]Ben & Jerry's has cookie dough or fudge in almost every single bite if you want to.
[16:50.12]And that's the best part about it.
[16:51.00]You can maneuver around Ben & Jerry's tub.
[16:54.62]Let's say you don't want a bite that has cookie dough in it.
[16:57.72]Oh, it's available for you.
[16:59.12]It's available.
[16:59.44]There's a little space right there you can carve into.
[17:03.01]That's by far the best ice cream brand that you can just buy at a store.
[17:09.91]I don't know what Biscuitville is.
[17:15.38]Bruh, that's not a restaurant.
[17:21.11]Wait.
[17:21.69]Yes, it is.
[17:23.21]Don't they have... Yes, it is.
[17:26.45]They have Ben & Jerry's.
[17:27.61]Like, little restaurants and stuff.
[17:29.79]Yeah, they do.
[17:32.75]Yeah, they have locations.
[17:34.91]Yeah.
[17:38.35]A Blaze Pizza.
[17:47.55]I'm going to put Blaze... Hold on.
[17:49.85]I know everyone's freaking out.
[17:52.33]Blaze Pizza might sit somewhere here, but... I almost feel like it's unfair for... Okay, I'm going to go on.
[18:02.40]I'm going to tell you a cookie dough rant here for Blaze Pizza.
[18:07.74]Blaze Pizza does half pies.
[18:09.96]Half pies.
[18:14.40]It's a little rectangle box and it's half a pizza.
[18:19.49]It's actually pretty awesome.
[18:22.03]Forget about the taste.
[18:22.99]Just the fact that they packaged that that way.
[18:24.71]You can order a half pizza.
[18:26.09]And you can DIY the whole thing, yeah?
[18:36.16]I'm going to keep it here for now.
[18:37.44]Because I think I've only had it like a handful of times.
[18:40.50]And I don't really remember how much I liked or disliked it.
[18:46.18]It's definitely better than Domino's.
[18:53.22]Blimpie?
[18:54.82]Blimpie?
[19:01.52]Why does this look like somebody wanted to put, like, Subway in a video game and not get, like, copyright striked?
[19:08.27]That's, like, what I'm seeing.
[19:09.49]What is this?
[19:14.03]I never heard of it.
[19:16.13]limpy I don't know I love subs though it sucks I've never had it you can't I can't say that uh Bob evans restaurant uh I've had Bob evans mashed potatoes the microwave ones and those are can I rate those can I rate the whole restaurant based only on the mashed potatoes that the microwave section
[19:49.16]Is this even the same person?
[19:50.62]Is this even the same company?
[19:53.72]Make a new meme.
[19:58.00]No, because the rest of the place is not... It's your tier list.
[20:03.63]I don't think that's fair.
[20:04.85]I would put their mashed potatoes like somewhere up here though.
[20:08.51]Although they could be a little too salty sometimes.
[20:10.51]Depends.
[20:11.71]But the microwave Bob Evans is pretty good.
[20:16.07]I don't know about the rest of the restaurant.
[20:19.48]Uh, Bojangles, I've not had.
[20:22.50]Boston Market, it's been a long time.
[20:26.45]But it's good.
[20:29.81]I think it's very good.
[20:31.45]But I don't remember how good.
[20:34.89]Make a meme.
[20:35.55]Alright, fine!
[20:37.43]No, nevermind.
[20:38.21]I was gonna just show you all my teeth and I don't wanna do that.
[20:42.14]I was gonna put my fingers in like this and just go like that.
[20:45.84]No, that would be very bad.
[20:48.50]I've never had it.
[20:53.32]Brewsters?
[20:55.02]I've never had this.
[20:58.10]Burger Fi.
[21:01.60]Or is that Burger Florida?
[21:06.22]I don't know.
[21:06.62]I've never had it.
[21:08.60]What is this one?
[21:09.36]Burger M?
[21:11.08]What's Burger Fi and Burger M?
[21:14.06]Are these two the same place?
[21:18.04]I don't know.
[21:18.78]Burger M and Burger Fi.
[21:33.51]Burger King's just... It's just not.
[21:35.43]Okay, I'm trying to think if I would rather eat Burger King or Domino's.
[21:47.97]And I would rather eat Burger King.
[21:52.03]This is going to get cleaned up.
[21:53.89]Relax.
[21:54.35]I'm going to clean this up.
[21:55.29]So people are saying, I can't believe Arby's is ahead of Burger King.
[21:58.69]I'm going to clean it up.
[21:59.83]And Auntie Anne's should absolutely be ahead of Arby's for sure, without a doubt.
[22:06.74]We're going to sort this.
[22:08.22]Just hold on.
[22:10.20]California Pizza Kitchen I've had once, and I don't even remember what it tasted like.
[22:14.58]I can't rate it.
[22:17.92]I had it one time.
[22:19.08]I have no idea.
[22:20.48]I have no memory of what it tasted like.
[22:25.26]captain d's Charles jr I've never had it Charlie's philly cheesesteaks I've I think I've had this once how many places have I had
[22:50.51]You're insane for putting Blaze Pizza above Domino's.
[22:54.13]I'm telling you, I'm going to clean this up.
[22:55.71]This is just to get it in a general location.
[23:01.97]Okay.
[23:03.03]A lot of sandwich, hot sandwich places, I go to local places for this.
[23:10.70]I don't go to most chains to get a Philly steak, Philly cheesesteak.
[23:15.78]I go to like a local place.
[23:19.17]I may have had this once, but not really.
[23:23.31]I've not had this at all.
[23:24.61]Alright, Chick-fil-A is going up here.
[23:29.19]I don't know.
[23:34.11]I think I would rather have Boston Market.
[23:39.32]Although this... Okay, here's one thing about... Okay.
[23:43.92]I didn't like that drive-thru experience.
[23:48.94]It's good, though.
[23:56.51]It's, like, too crowded.
[23:57.49]I don't know.
[23:59.89]Is it too crowded and too obscene to, like, go get that for how much I think I like it?
[24:11.16]We'll see.
[24:14.34]Auntie Anne's is better?
[24:16.06]Auntie Anne's probably should be here.
[24:18.38]I would think that was a little too harsh.
[24:19.76]I think it was a little too harsh on Auntie Anne's.
[24:23.20]I think so.
[24:26.68]Maybe, should I put Auntie Anne's up to good?
[24:29.64]McChicken will always shine brighter.
[24:33.84]I am going to, okay, let's just do it now because people are going to fucking freak out.
[24:38.35]McDonald's is up here.
[24:39.55]I love this place.
[24:41.21]Like, I'm sorry.
[24:42.37]I do.
[24:43.43]I love McDonald's.
[24:45.87]People are going to fucking freak out.
[24:47.03]I know you are.
[24:50.66]I know.
[24:51.36]Look, it's like I grew up eating McDonald's.
[24:56.07]It was like a childhood memory.
[25:01.95]The McChicken is so good.
[25:04.27]It brings me back memories and stuff.
[25:07.72]I don't know.
[25:10.36]I love McDonald's.
[25:12.16]You can call me a fucking disgusting loser all you want.
[25:15.92]I actually really do like it.
[25:19.50]Look, I don't just put how much I like the food.
[25:21.80]I put, like, memories.
[25:24.62]Atmosphere.
[25:26.96]500 cars in the drive-thru.
[25:29.92]You know what I mean?
[25:30.68]Like, I... This all comes into my brain.
[25:34.06]Right?
[25:36.02]So when I'm sitting here going... Seven years old.
[25:41.52]Four-piece chicken nuggets.
[25:43.04]Apple slice.
[25:44.46]Not...
[25:45.60]A thousand fucking people at the restaurant screaming at each other.
[25:52.02]Good.
[25:52.96]Good, delicious McChickens.
[25:55.15]McDoubles.
[25:55.67]Everything.
[25:55.99]Oh, yeah.
[25:56.89]It's up there.
[25:59.75]You using nostalgia?
[26:00.57]Yeah, I am.
[26:01.83]It's not about just how good quotes the food is.
[26:04.89]There's other things that factor in.
[26:09.58]A play place.
[26:10.28]Yeah.
[26:12.82]Oh, fuck this.
[26:13.84]It's going up.
[26:14.30]No, it's not.
[26:20.47]You're literally conditioned to like McDonald's.
[26:25.60]That's fucking so stupid.
[26:32.82]Yeah, I remember that comment from last time.
[26:34.54]Eat a McDick.
[26:37.06]Oh, I remember that one.
[26:38.38]I knew three years later, two years later, I was gonna have to defend this again.
[26:48.07]Oh, man.
[26:50.38]People are gonna be really mad.
[26:51.70]I don't think... I think this is very overrated.
[26:54.70]Like very, very overrated.
[26:57.52]But it's better than Arby's.
[27:13.87]Look.
[27:15.49]I don't think it's bad.
[27:17.81]But I'm telling you right now, there are, especially here, especially in the southwestern United States, there are some incredible local Mexican restaurants that I would rather go to a hundred times over.
[27:36.60]I find them 10 million times better, in my opinion.
[27:41.25]And a lot of times they might even be cheaper or the same price.
[27:46.41]It's like a thousand times better.
[27:47.93]If there's a Chipotle, like, here, and across the street is like a local Mexican, like, restaurant that serves, like, authentic Mexican, I'm gonna go here.
[28:00.90]I'm not gonna go here.
[28:01.88]I'm gonna go here.
[28:08.72]Chipotle is the definition of sus.
[28:11.76]I don't think it's good.
[28:13.22]Like, I've eaten Chipotle more than a few times.
[28:17.26]But it's literally at the bottom of the list.
[28:21.29]If there's even one decent Mexican restaurant, like a local Mexican restaurant, it's not even on my mind to even think to go there.
[28:34.18]But that doesn't mean the food is bad, right?
[28:35.94]Like, I just... It's probably like... It's probably like here.
[28:49.92]Realistically, it's probably here, but no, no, I don't know.
[28:56.92]Put CC's in F if you've never been.
[29:09.55]I've not had Church's Chicken.
[29:12.55]CC's Pizza.
[29:15.71]I mean, I haven't had it, so...
[29:19.04]Bro, rate Taco Bell.
[29:23.88]Cinnabon is so good, but I mean, I haven't had it in a long time.
[29:32.26]Cold Stone Creamery.
[29:36.81]Cold Stone is good.
[29:38.19]It is.
[29:43.43]Cold Stone is really good, isn't it?
[29:46.61]Wait, hold on.
[29:47.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[29:49.23]Cold Stone is the place that doesn't have sizes, right?
[29:53.51]It has like, I like it, I love it, I really love you, right?
[29:57.28]Is that what it is?
[30:02.44]And if you tip, they have to sing a song.
[30:04.12]No, no, let me just give the money to the person.
[30:05.86]Like, yeah, this is going down here.
[30:14.16]No, I just want to, I just want to, you know what, like, I just want to, like, put, like, fucking cash in an envelope and, like, tape it to the fucking back of the door in front of the restaurant and just be like, and just fucking leave.
[30:26.20]You know what I mean?
[30:28.88]I don't want to be sung to.
[30:30.12]I don't like being sung to.
[30:32.45]I hate, I don't want to be sung to.
[30:33.97]Especially, even at, like, restaurants, birthday shit, when they come over and, like, clap.
[30:36.71]No, please leave me alone.
[30:38.21]Please.
[30:39.19]I don't, even if you're going to give me, like, a free cupcake, I don't want it.
[30:42.61]I do, please leave me alone.
[30:47.07]I would rather just have us do a transaction and then be done with it.
[30:49.65]I don't want to look around and be like, oh, yeah!
[30:56.09]No, because it feels weird.
[30:57.31]I don't like it.
[31:03.19]You placed Arby's above Domino's.
[31:05.13]Do you have bad taste buds?
[31:06.73]Look, it's not done.
[31:07.61]I'm just getting everything in the right spot.
[31:10.73]A Cold Stone doesn't do that.
[31:12.47]Did they get rid of it?
[31:18.61]Wait, I want to read what this person said.
[31:20.49]If you put KFC low, I'm going to buy you a ticket to Europe so you can see how much better it is here.
[31:26.20]I think KFC is... I like KFC.
[31:33.19]But... I like... Kostan's ice cream is good.
[31:36.97]But...
[31:38.20]I don't know what it's being sung to.
[31:40.00]Maybe I'm just a weirdo.
[31:41.90]It's good.
[31:42.30]The ice cream is good.
[31:43.36]But they do, like, the weird size names.
[31:48.35]I know, like, I'm not the first person on the internet to talk about this.
[31:51.35]I know everyone has made a comment on this.
[31:55.23]But it's just small, medium, and large.
[31:57.87]It's so fucking easy.
[31:59.27]It's so simple.
[31:59.99]I don't know why we have to, like... I don't know.
[32:03.21]Alright.
[32:04.09]We'll see.
[32:04.40]Cookout.
[32:06.60]Cookout.
[32:08.36]I've never had it.
[32:10.86]Culver's?
[32:12.20]I think I've heard of this, but I haven't had it.
[32:13.72]Dairy Queen.
[32:16.02]I had a cheeseburger from Dairy Queen one time.
[32:30.47]I had a cheeseburger from Dairy Queen one time, and I'm trying to remember how bad it was.
[32:51.07]Hold on, wait.
[32:51.73]I gotta put myself back.
[32:58.47]Cheese is melted, okay?
[33:02.69]It smells good.
[33:04.73]I've been waiting.
[33:05.23]I've been standing around, waiting.
[33:07.03]I can smell.
[33:09.37]Cheese is melted.
[33:10.62]There's crispy lettuce on it.
[33:13.26]Took a while, though.
[33:17.98]Okay.
[33:19.82]Mmm, I wasn't a fan of the selection.
[33:23.06]Okay, I got it.
[33:27.88]You're a psycho?
[33:28.50]What?
[33:28.92]I'm just, I can time travel in my own head.
[33:31.23]What, you guys can't do that?
[33:35.51]You know that you can time travel?
[33:37.61]Like, you just go back into, like, your own memories and just time travel back to a different time?
[33:42.15]Isn't that insane that you can do that?
[33:45.51]Like, I can literally close my eyes and just, like, be, like, at some point, like, in the past.
[33:55.13]Can't even rotate a cube in their head.
[34:04.40]Yeah, people gave me shit for this before.
[34:06.06]It's just a memory, I know.
[34:07.76]But isn't a memory... We've already had this conversation.
[34:10.66]A memory is, like, internal time travel.
[34:15.37]I like Del Taco a lot.
[34:19.97]This is going to be very hard.
[34:32.46]You know why I like Del Taco?
[34:35.89]Because Del Taco has fries.
[34:39.65]That's kind of cool.
[34:44.58]It's like, no, that's pretty cool.
[34:48.89]Yeah, they have fries.
[34:52.41]What an American.
[34:59.95]As somebody that grew up, like, in Boston, in the Boston area, it feels horrible to put this here.
[35:07.36]But it's fucking awful now.
[35:11.34]Awful.
[35:14.20]It sucks because 10 years ago, this would have been like up here.
[35:19.36]Maybe here.
[35:22.37]My opinion was solidified on Dunkin' Donuts recently, like within the last year.
[35:28.37]I had it.
[35:30.11]And it was probably the worst coffee I've ever had in my entire life.
[35:36.33]And I remember just taking like a few sips and being like, what the fuck, man?
[35:40.75]Like what happened?
[35:47.14]Mmm, but... But hold on, but about, like, what about, like, Dave's making the donuts, you know what I mean?
[35:54.69]The guy with the mustache?
[35:57.71]And he would turn around to the camera with a big tray?
[36:11.12]Yeah, I remember Dave, Dave from Dunkin' Donuts.
[36:13.42]It was like he was supposed to be like the owner.
[36:15.52]He like owned the restaurant and he made the donuts.
[36:21.28]It was like, it's me, Dave, from Dunkin' Donuts.
[36:27.14]That's the only reason why it's up here.
[36:29.70]But it's just, it's not, in my personal opinion, it's just not, it's not very good.
[36:35.69]And I remember maybe, maybe it, maybe it, was it always bad?
[36:38.75]I don't know.
[36:40.71]I remember like at least five to ten years ago, it was like, holy shit, a blueberry iced coffee.
[36:44.69]You know, you guys have seen me drink this shit on camera.
[36:47.94]Oh, blueberry iced coffee!
[36:49.14]It was like a joke on the channel like five, six years ago.
[36:52.06]Right?
[36:52.22]I don't know what happened.
[36:54.84]I don't like it anymore.
[36:57.18]But holy shit, the blueberry iced coffee from Dunkin' Donuts was the best thing I ever drank.
[37:03.91]Denny's gets points because they've never closed ever in, like, the history of the human race.
[37:10.39]Like, that's the only reason why they get points.
[37:16.97]Like, Galileo was going to Denny's.
[37:19.57]And, like, they never closed, and they've always been open since then.
[37:23.76]So, it belongs up in, like, it's okay.
[37:26.58]I like it.
[37:27.42]It's alright.
[37:42.88]Dunkin' is of all franchises.
[37:45.10]I'm sure it's total shit on the West Coast.
[37:46.98]It's still fire on the East Coast, I promise.
[37:50.39]But I'm... I have this opinion, okay?
[37:55.43]If you have a good product, and it's really good and people love it, you need to make sure that that product is good everywhere.
[38:02.41]You cannot have your name on a product and just blow it over and just over-expand to a point where the product is not the same product.
[38:10.01]It's a worse product.
[38:12.24]If you have that good product, it's gotta be good everywhere.
[38:20.60]Like, if I go to the East Coast and get a blueberry iced coffee and I go, holy shit, this is incredible.
[38:25.19]What the fuck am I drinking over here?
[38:26.47]You know what I mean?
[38:27.37]That's why... Is this even Dunkin' Donuts?
[38:31.13]Does it have to be called something else?
[38:37.11]Dave works at every store.
[38:46.10]They can't control every one of them.
[38:50.23]I'm just saying, I've been to at least three or four separate locations of Dunkin' Donuts in the last, like, three or four years.
[38:59.53]And it's not... I have been... Personally thought it was not very good each time.
[39:09.50]These are good.
[39:11.32]But I've... Have I not had it enough?
[39:16.04]Eat a Dunkin... Whatever, time that person out for like five minutes.
[39:27.41]Look at the fuck.
[39:29.41]Okay.
[39:31.33]Uh... Yeah, I remember this place being pretty good.
[39:38.33]Fuck, I've still not had this.
[39:42.45]Okay, I'm going to put this up here because I want this.
[39:45.52]I see it.
[39:46.14]It's everywhere.
[39:48.02]I want this.
[39:49.86]I need to have this.
[39:53.20]I've not had El Pollo Loco.
[39:55.04]Not yet.
[39:58.99]It's okay.
[40:01.93]We have it in down... Yeah, I heard it's good.
[40:03.77]I heard it's like... Because they give you...
[40:08.10]It's like a chicken drumstick and like sides.
[40:11.78]It's like a fast food, but it's not, right?
[40:14.92]It's like a KFC if there wasn't like breading on the chicken, right?
[40:18.06]But do I have that correct?
[40:24.05]It's pretty healthy.
[40:27.39]Yeah, I want to try it.
[40:28.31]I've seen a thousand of these locations and I'm just like, fuck, I want to have it one day.
[40:36.27]But this falls into the same category of the problem that I have, like, eating Chipotle, right?
[40:40.32]Is, like, El Pollo Loco will be there, and I'm like, oh, El Pollo Loco!
[40:47.42]Local Mexican restaurant, right here.
[40:49.24]Yeah, that's where I'm going.
[40:50.54]It's tough for me to do.
[40:51.96]Mexican food is, like, my number one.
[40:53.90]Probably at least one or two.
[40:55.68]Favorite food in the world.
[40:57.60]So, I, like, always don't have an opportunity to go here, because if I'm like, I want to try El Pollo Loco!
[41:04.69]That place has a burrito that's fucking incredible, and it's the best burrito I've had in, like, my whole life.
[41:10.01]I'd like, it's hard for me to go there, to El Pollo Loco.
[41:15.14]Alright, Fatburger.
[41:16.36]Uh, I've had, I don't, have I, have I had this?
[41:21.60]Maybe?
[41:24.52]Why do I remember this, for some reason?
[41:33.07]Maybe I've had it, like, once.
[41:37.15]This logo is familiar, and I, like, I remember the logo, and I remember, like, it tasting good.
[41:45.61]I'm gonna put it here for now.
[41:46.52]This has to move.
[41:48.64]I'll fix this in a minute.
[41:49.44]Don't worry.
[41:53.46]I've not had Zolies.
[41:58.92]I'm gonna burp, and it's gonna be gross.
[42:01.74]No, I didn't.
[42:02.74]Okay.
[42:03.18]Uh, Firehouse Subs is good.
[42:11.69]Hmm.
[42:16.69]Although, I like Firehouse subs.
[42:21.53]But I feel like this selection is a little limited for me.
[42:26.71]They have a handful of their specialty sandwiches.
[42:32.85]But again, I would not go to Firehouse if I could go, like, you know, Frank Pizza's Pizzeria!
[42:40.13]And it's, like, fucking great.
[42:41.33]And it's, like, subs and shit and pizza.
[42:42.67]Like, I don't know.
[42:47.43]I actually genuinely think it's better than... Yeah, we'll have to go through this again.
[42:55.80]Five Guys is really good.
[42:59.76]It is.
[43:00.83]But their fries are total absolute ass.
[43:12.14]I know people think that's a weird opinion, but I think the fries are fucking awful.
[43:20.65]Their burgers are amazing.
[43:30.08]I'm gonna, okay, the perfect french fry to me, and you guys will know what I'm talking about, and maybe, okay, whatever your opinion on me after this is how you're gonna have the opinion, right?
[43:41.07]French fry.
[43:42.47]I like the orange french fries that are crunchy on the outside, and they're a little bit long and thicker, they're like crunchy, and they're orange.
[43:52.98]You guys know exactly what I'm talking about, they're like a dark orange color.
[43:57.74]They're like, crunch.
[43:59.66]And there's like, it's, it's, they're, they're crunchy, and they have like this potato in the middle.
[44:04.04]Not a carrot!
[44:04.88]I'm not eating carrots!
[44:06.78]Not sweet potato.
[44:08.44]It's like from takeout restaurants, the dark orange, long french fry.
[44:15.97]Not a wedge, no.
[44:19.79]I know that some people will know exactly what I'm talking about.
[44:22.39]It's like that, they're, yeah.
[44:26.65]They're like orange.
[44:29.15]I don't like French.
[44:30.49]Okay, this is... How many times have I said, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[44:38.37]How many times have I said, listen, okay, okay.
[44:42.64]I know that french fries are potatoes that you just julienne them and you put them in some oil and that's a- that's a french fry, right?
[44:52.88]But I don't like, like, potatoey french fries.
[44:56.80]I like my french fries to be crispy on the outside with, like, a good crunch with some of that, like, potatoey in the middle.
[45:11.23]You're insane.
[45:14.79]You guys don't know what Julianne slice?
[45:19.83]You guys don't know what that means?
[45:24.64]They're too mushy.
[45:25.26]Yeah, they are.
[45:29.56]Chefs in chat, what's going on here?
[45:32.14]Does he know that he's on stream?
[45:35.13]Alright, for a second I thought I had like a electrode on my temple.
[45:41.05]Because this, I just like glanced over here, like at the preview.
[45:46.14]So you're here, and the preview's here.
[45:49.46]I just looked over here, and was like, what the fuck is attached to my head?
[45:54.89]Am I like, what am I connected to?
[46:02.20]Electrode.
[46:05.62]Okay.
[46:05.72]Okay.
[46:10.94]It's been a very long time since I've even seen a Friendly's, but I remember it being in the same tier as, like, Denny's.
[46:21.25]But... They had this thing called a Jubilee Roll at Friendly's.
[46:28.87]And it was this ice cream roll that had, like, frosting on top, and you had to cut it.
[46:34.48]It was, like, ice cream roll.
[46:35.54]That puts it ahead.
[46:43.34]puts it ahead.
[46:46.27]Arby's has mozzarella sticks.
[46:47.41]Sorry, I came here to defend Arby's.
[46:54.83]I gave my opinion on Arby's.
[46:56.47]If I want a turkey sandwich, deli-sliced roast beef sandwich, I just can get that at the deli.
[47:04.46]I can make it literally from the fridge.
[47:07.66]That's not to say it's bad.
[47:13.33]RB's defenders exist.
[47:22.59]Fuddruckers.
[47:23.59]I've had it.
[47:25.23]It was good, but not good enough for me to remember and go, oh, yeah.
[47:32.20]I feel like it was better than this, though.
[47:39.00]Crash.
[47:41.28]Green Burrito.
[47:41.90]I've never had it.
[47:43.79]Uh, Hardee's and Carl's Jr.
[47:45.99]This is like a, correct me if I'm wrong, but Carl's Jr.
[47:49.19]or Hardee's is just a League of Legends skin of Carl's Jr., right?
[47:56.12]I've not had either one of them.
[48:00.86]Harvey's.
[48:01.44]Huddle House.
[48:05.60]IHOP is kind of in the Denny's tier.
[48:07.70]It's just always open.
[48:11.19]But I think I would rather go to Denny's.
[48:13.57]Uh-oh.
[48:28.48]Turn the alarm off.
[48:34.03]Oh shit, there's a lot of new viewers.
[48:35.53]There are a lot of new people here.
[48:37.61]Uh-oh.
[48:48.12]How many people are here?
[48:48.92]I think the average concurrent viewers that I had when I did this last time was probably like 4,000.
[48:54.19]There's a shitload of new people that probably love this place.
[48:59.43]And I'm about to literally just... I'm about to literally just fucking make you probably leave the channel.
[49:21.72]What do I say to them?
[49:22.28]Okay.
[49:23.94]In-N-Out is good.
[49:26.30]But I put it in the same category as... No, that's not fair.
[49:29.64]I was going to say Chipotle.
[49:30.78]That's unfair.
[49:31.66]It's way better than Chipotle.
[49:32.82]And I like it.
[49:33.68]I would rather go there than Chipotle.
[49:37.52]It... It's good.
[49:40.62]But it's not so good that I would... It's not S tier.
[49:48.22]I have a problem...
[49:50.01]with the secret menu in a lot of these places.
[49:54.62]I have to, there's like 10,000 plus more people here than were last time.
[49:57.42]I have to tell, I have to tell them about this.
[50:02.56]They have a menu and then they have this secret menu, but like who fucking cares?
[50:08.52]Why is it even on, why?
[50:10.00]Just put it on the menu and wrap the burgers.
[50:13.94]I don't want like half open and it's like in a bag that I got like through the drive-thru.
[50:21.60]It's not a secret anymore.
[50:23.22]Animal style fries.
[50:24.40]It's not like, oh, quiet.
[50:27.68]Hey, I think I'll order that burger.
[50:30.57]Animal style.
[50:31.91]Whoa.
[50:32.93]What happened?
[50:34.13]What did he say?
[50:34.57]Dude, don't fucking say that so loud.
[50:37.75]What is wrong with you?
[50:38.51]Don't say that so loud.
[50:41.64]Just put it on the menu.
[50:45.58]Wait.
[50:49.12]Wait a minute.
[50:51.21]I was told that In-N-Out, this is another problem I have with it, okay?
[50:57.77]Big problem I have with In-N-Out.
[50:59.83]I ordered In-N-Out the way I am supposed to order the burger, right?
[51:05.27]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[51:06.09]You can't just go to In-N-Out and order the burger on the menu.
[51:08.83]Nope.
[51:09.09]You've got to do animal style with grilled onions and make sure that they put it in a to-go box.
[51:15.82]Just why do I have to order this thing so special to make it taste the way that it's supposed to be?
[51:20.99]Like every time you talk to somebody that loves In-N-Out, they tell you don't order fucking anything off the menu.
[51:24.79]You have to change everything.
[51:30.05]But I'll tell you, I ordered a burger with the grilled onions in a takeout box.
[51:37.10]And I sat there and I ate it and I said, holy shit, this is fucking really, really good.
[51:43.14]Way better than the default burger that you just order off the menu.
[51:46.97]Way better.
[51:48.17]And I mean like probably like a hundred times better.
[51:54.67]so I'm going to okay you ready internet's going up here but then it's being it's being like it's being like changed right like it's up here then it comes down here this is like the the hold on this is this is up like this can't be here neither can this neither can that
[52:26.79]Ear pressure change.
[52:27.53]No.
[52:28.55]I'm just telling you that I finally ate In-N-Out the way that I was told I was supposed to, quote, order special the burger.
[52:36.30]And it was better than just ordering it off the menu.
[52:40.94]Which makes me want to put it down here.
[52:45.20]Eat an animal-style dick!
[53:09.08]And this is another place that's fucking crowded all the time.
[53:12.40]It's just like, look, if I'm hungry and I want like a quick burger or something, like, time to go sit in an In-N-Out line for like 10 to 15 minutes.
[53:21.52]Sometimes that line is like as the same as like Chick-fil-A.
[53:33.31]I want to make this clear.
[53:34.51]I don't think In-N-Out is bad.
[53:36.59]I think it's good.
[53:38.22]But the process to get it to be good is a little irritating to me.
[53:45.99]And wrap the burgers up like every fucking other restaurant does.
[53:48.75]Every other restaurant does this.
[53:50.83]If it was like one or two other places did this, it's fine.
[53:53.65]Every single fast food burger place does not have your burger out in the open in the bag.
[54:00.56]Wrap the burger up.
[54:01.42]I don't care.
[54:02.08]I don't care.
[54:03.16]Just please put it in a wrapper.
[54:04.36]Let me wrap it and put it in a bag, please.
[54:15.25]Get out of here.
[54:18.84]Jack in the Box?
[54:22.70]Why is In-N-Out before McDonald's?
[54:24.06]Because that's where it is.
[54:29.37]If you want a wrapper, you ask for the takeout box.
[54:34.53]If you're driving in your car...
[54:38.17]and they give you a cardboard box that's like this cardboard fucking shoe box that you're supposed to... I want a bag!
[54:47.10]I don't want like this cardboard box that like somebody has to fucking hold like this.
[54:52.44]I want a bag.
[54:53.50]Put it in a bag and wrap it.
[55:06.20]It's a box in a bag.
[55:13.19]You just put it in a bag!
[55:20.31]Like, Joe McDonald figured this out in like the 1910 or whenever the fuck this was.
[55:27.50]He figured this out in like the fucking 1800s when McDonald's opened for the first time.
[55:32.78]You just like wrap it in a little bit of paper and you give it to the customer.
[55:38.41]I'm not going to stay on this.
[55:39.59]Just know I like the taste.
[55:40.94]I think it's fucking good, but... The Simpsons.
[55:55.09]Wait, did we do this already?
[55:56.05]Hold on.
[56:02.75]I'm freaking out.
[56:04.03]Simpsons.
[56:05.20]Intro.
[56:05.44]Intro.
[56:19.36]I'm loving it.
[56:23.74]Yeah, that's weird.
[56:28.70]What is Jack's?
[56:29.50]Is Jack's not Jack in the Box?
[56:39.28]Is this the same?
[56:45.29]You can see the insanity in his eyes.
[56:46.65]Why do you like your burger mushed to shit?
[56:58.87]Okay, if I eat in the restaurant in In-N-Out, I... But, I need to be fair.
[57:06.88]I cannot remember the last time
[57:10.37]that I went into a fast food restaurant to sit down and eat there.
[57:14.79]It's been... I can't even remember when I did that last.
[57:20.55]I knew I was going to have to defend this to the new viewers here.
[57:23.49]Hey, Paul.
[57:32.87]I don't... This is not Jack in the Box.
[57:34.28]I don't know what it is.
[57:35.40]I've never had, um... Jamba Juice?
[57:38.48]No.
[57:39.86]Uh, Jason's Deli is just Panera Bread with a different name.
[57:44.56]I... I mean, that's just kind of how I see it.
[57:49.98]Um... Jason's Deli is for men.
[58:06.63]What do you mean it's for men?
[58:10.41]It's like the number one at Jason's Deli, like a steak sandwich with a beer.
[58:15.76]And it comes with a free lawnmower coupon.
[58:18.18]What do you mean for men?
[58:21.32]Does it come with like aftershave?
[58:22.66]What are you talking about?
[58:23.46]It comes...
[58:36.68]Uh, I've had it before.
[58:38.06]It's... I thought it was good.
[58:39.86]I thought... I mean, I don't know if I'd put it, like, up into, like, our coveted In-N-Out tier.
[58:50.85]And I don't know if I... I'd rather probably just go to... Okay.
[58:58.55]I ate at a restaurant.
[58:59.39]Is this weird?
[59:00.11]This is kind of a completely off-topic story.
[59:04.27]I ate at a... I feel like people, like... I don't know.
[59:07.60]I ate at a restaurant one time.
[59:09.46]And then I walked.
[59:10.36]I finished my full meal at this restaurant.
[59:13.59]And there was a Baskin Robbins right next to it.
[59:16.37]Connected to this place.
[59:17.71]Connected to the restaurant.
[59:20.39]And I walked out of the restaurant.
[59:22.87]I ate a full meal.
[59:24.13]I was full.
[59:24.95]It was a lot.
[59:25.33]It was food, right?
[59:27.02]And I walked out and like into the Baskin Robbins.
[59:31.52]And like I felt like it was, I don't know.
[59:33.08]Something was weird about it.
[59:35.44]Like, I walked out and then in, and they came out with a big ice cream.
[59:39.00]And I don't know, I feel like the workers were probably just like, holy shit, this guy's fucking hungry.
[59:44.28]This dude got, like, a large, big ice cream?
[59:47.28]He just had, like, a full dinner.
[59:48.62]Yeah, the munchies.
[59:57.52]But it was, I don't know.
[59:59.02]Because it was immediately after I finished.
[60:01.74]It was like, thank you.
[60:03.62]No, that was great.
[60:04.29]Thank you.
[60:07.63]In the other door.
[60:13.75]Jersey Mike's, or what I like to call this place, Oregano Mike's, because it's on every sandwich.
[60:20.34]I'm actually not that big of a fan of this place.
[60:31.60]But it's good.
[60:36.07]It's just Oregano Subway.
[60:43.60]Yeah, I... It's definitely better than, like, fucking... It's probably better than Arby's.
[60:54.76]I had a turkey sandwich from this place before.
[60:58.12]And it was like, that was fine.
[61:00.70]It was just too much oregano on it.
[61:02.66]I think I ordered it the wrong way.
[61:06.52]It was fine.
[61:07.04]It's not like, oh, wow!
[61:12.64]Um...
[61:14.57]I would probably rather go to Firehouse than Jersey Mike's.
[61:18.71]Jimmy John's.
[61:20.47]These are just the same place in my brain.
[61:30.36]I cannot distinguish between the two of these in my head.
[61:39.44]But I should be able to, right?
[61:42.39]I feel like... If I have to remember the few times I've had both of these... I don't know.
[61:52.38]I just don't know.
[61:59.30]Johnny Rockets?
[62:00.22]Oh, man.
[62:06.64]I got boogers coming out of my nose, I think.
[62:07.96]Just be aware.
[62:09.94]Johnny Rockets is good.
[62:11.92]But how good?
[62:12.76]That's the question.
[62:20.03]Keep in mind, I ate at this restaurant last time.
[62:22.85]I was probably 11.
[62:23.61]So I don't know how much of an opinion I can form here.
[62:39.78]Eat your boogers, booger boy.
[62:47.84]I cannot speak to it.
[62:49.44]And unfortunately, if I haven't had it in over 10 plus years, it has to go down here.
[62:54.01]It just does.
[62:57.05]Jollibee is a really interesting place.
[62:59.45]Jollibee is one of the only like fast food restaurants that has like fucking spaghetti.
[63:05.65]It was like, holy shit, what?
[63:17.56]I've had it a couple times, and I like it.
[63:18.98]That doesn't mean it's good.
[63:28.85]Well, now, why am I... I'm too bright now.
[63:30.31]What happened here?
[63:40.21]Okay.
[63:43.88]Um, I don't remember being like, holy shit, this is good.
[63:47.72]Five Guys should not be here, and neither should Chick-fil-A.
[63:49.92]McDonald's should be here.
[63:51.52]Ah, oh my god, Jerma.
[63:52.70]Oh my god, based.
[63:54.36]Yeah, thanks.
[64:04.48]Was that one guy in the chat that said that he was going to be mad if I did this?
[64:11.95]I like this place.
[64:14.99]You know what sucks about KFC?
[64:17.58]Doesn't it suck being the only person in the group of your group of friends that recommends this place and wants to go but nobody else does?
[64:24.66]Ever?
[64:28.91]What do you want to get for food, guys?
[64:31.23]Oh, you know, let's think about it.
[64:33.61]KFC is around.
[64:34.43]There's a KFC.
[64:35.61]We could go to KFC.
[64:37.88]No, no, yeah, we could, but we could go here, we could go here.
[64:40.94]Oh, okay, we're not going.
[64:42.85]It's like, I feel like I'm the only person that ever recommends to ever go here.
[64:46.93]Like, ever, in all my groups I've ever been in.
[64:50.57]So I don't get to have it that often, because it's like, it's hard.
[64:53.45]Okay.
[64:54.91]When I think of going to KFC, I think of, you get, like, all the sides.
[65:00.42]You get the bucket of chicken.
[65:02.10]You get all the biscuits.
[65:04.54]I don't really want to go to KFC to order, like, just one little thing.
[65:09.63]I only want to go to KFC if I get, like, the whole spread.
[65:18.46]But I like it.
[65:19.70]I do.
[65:22.76]Their mashed potatoes are great.
[65:24.30]Their macaroni and cheese is awesome.
[65:25.90]Their corn.
[65:26.66]I love that watery-ass corn, don't you?
[65:29.91]God, I love it.
[65:32.55]I try to deliberately get the water in my mouth.
[65:34.79]I deliberately try to get, like, the liquid.
[65:37.57]Oh, I love it.
[65:45.36]I'm sitting here thinking about, like, that watery-ass corn, and I want it up here.
[65:49.84]Fuck, this is, like, just kind of, like... I haven't eaten today.
[65:52.50]I have not eaten.
[65:55.05]So, right now, you are... I'm just realizing what's going on.
[66:00.13]I'm rating these based on what I want, like, tonight for dinner.
[66:03.23]Not about how good they are.
[66:06.41]I want that fucking watery corn tonight.
[66:11.32]So, that's happening.
[66:12.06]Okay.
[66:18.21]Okay.
[66:19.07]Krispy Kreme, I mean, this is like the meme.
[66:24.46]It's good.
[66:24.92]I mean... It's good.
[66:29.40]How good, though?
[66:33.06]It's... I remember biting into a Krispy Kreme donut, and before I could chew, it was gone.
[66:41.53]And I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
[66:47.40]It was like, it's like the cotton candy of donuts.
[66:51.62]It's just gone.
[67:02.83]This is kind of unfair, though, because Krispy Kreme just does one, like, meme thing where it's like the Krispy Kreme delicious, yummy Krispy Kreme sugary melts-in-your-mouth donut, but I would, I'm not gonna go to Krispy Kreme instead of Firehouse Subs.
[67:14.79]It's a different world.
[67:23.20]I'm going to keep it here for now.
[67:25.16]I've never had this.
[67:25.88]I haven't had this since I was probably like 12.
[67:32.61]But I like the little guy.
[67:33.87]So he's going up here.
[67:36.51]I've not had Long John Silver's.
[67:38.39]I've never had Marco's.
[67:39.95]I've never had McAllister's.
[67:44.35]Maude.
[67:46.78]Moe's.
[67:50.00]Moe's is fucking good.
[67:53.03]Moe's is way better.
[67:55.78]Way better.
[67:56.36]But it's been a long time.
[67:59.60]Moe's is better than Chipotle.
[68:02.22]It is.
[68:02.82]It's far better.
[68:03.52]It's far superior.
[68:04.61]Hold on.
[68:10.03]Why am I so blown out?
[68:11.53]Where's this light coming from?
[68:22.76]Heavily disagree.
[68:25.28]You know, honestly, if you think Moe's is better than Chipotle, like that, to me, to hear somebody say that, to me, that's like, oh, yeah, okay.
[68:34.11]You and I are on the same page.
[68:36.31]Based.
[68:37.21]Like, that's my based.
[68:40.45]For me.
[68:41.73]If you say Chipotle is better than Moe's, it's like, oh, you and I are not going to get along.
[68:47.50]We're just not at all.
[68:49.32]We may just delete my number from your phone.
[68:50.92]Like, we're not going to hang up.
[69:00.08]I keep saying based.
[69:01.96]I don't know why.
[69:02.86]It's just like it's in the brain now.
[69:06.62]Oh, I know why it's because the light's not on in this room.
[69:13.45]I was wondering like why does it look so weird in here?
[69:20.17]I'm sitting kind of in like a dark room and I didn't realize it.
[69:25.75]Now it looks like normal.
[69:27.11]Okay, that was weird.
[69:35.56]There we go.
[69:36.06]Okay.
[69:36.16]What are you guys saying?
[69:45.51]Noodles?
[69:48.61]Panda Express.
[69:50.97]Wait, what did I just put up?
[69:52.07]I put something.
[69:52.73]What was it?
[69:53.37]Oh, Little Caesars.
[69:54.13]Okay.
[69:55.47]Panda Express is hard.
[69:59.20]This is not Panda Express?
[70:02.34]Yes.
[70:05.73]Anyways, it is fun.
[70:12.06]What else would it be?
[70:12.58]Yeah, what are you talking about?
[70:13.44]There's another panda?
[70:19.80]Stop ignoring us.
[70:20.61]What are you talking about?
[70:24.05]I don't think I've...
[70:28.02]I think I ate.
[70:29.16]I tried it off of somebody's plate.
[70:31.16]Somebody ordered it, and I was like, oh, I'll try it.
[70:33.80]And I ate like one piece of chicken, but I've never really eaten it.
[70:37.58]I haven't.
[70:41.64]Did you forget about the phenomenal tier?
[70:43.06]No.
[70:44.10]I just need to make sure that stuff that goes up there is stuff that I absolutely am certain of.
[70:48.04]And then some of those might move.
[70:49.26]So we're going to move a lot of this shit around.
[70:52.96]Is Panera... Panera's... Alright.
[70:56.38]Alright.
[70:59.94]I do like cheddar broccoli soup in a bread bowl.
[71:04.02]As much as people want to talk about Panera, you gotta remember something.
[71:07.62]Panera was like the first restaurant to really do shit like that.
[71:13.22]Wait, I can get like soup in a bread bowl?
[71:15.39]Like nobody did that shit like 10, 20 years ago.
[71:22.59]So they kind of paved the way for a lot of these restaurants that you see now.
[71:28.59]It's hospital food.
[71:34.13]um if you really think that friendlies is better like for you what is friendlies then what would you consider friendlies to be in in this scenario quality
[71:58.06]Okay.
[72:00.08]It's alright.
[72:00.66]It's better.
[72:00.94]I'll fix it.
[72:01.58]But I don't think it's, like, great.
[72:03.02]I think it's good.
[72:03.52]I've had it a bunch of times.
[72:05.76]Papa John's, I think I've had it once.
[72:13.42]I think I've had it one time.
[72:14.66]I don't, like... I haven't, like, had it.
[72:21.16]I don't... I don't really order from very many pizza chains.
[72:24.37]Like I said before, if there's a local place, I would get it.
[72:28.94]So, it's not even on the list.
[72:31.02]I don't eat it.
[72:34.54]Papa... Papa Murphy?
[72:37.38]East Coast Subs.
[72:41.26]Pita Pit?
[72:43.53]Pizza Hut goes way up here because it has the stuffed crust.
[72:46.49]And everybody... All these other pretenders that did stuffed crust.
[72:51.45]It's not even remotely the same.
[72:53.73]It's not even fucking close.
[72:56.23]Stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut.
[72:57.71]I don't know what they put in that crust.
[72:59.05]I don't know what they do to it.
[73:01.07]I love it.
[73:02.21]I love it so much.
[73:03.54]And other people have tried to imitate, and it's just not even close.
[73:14.64]But it should be up here.
[73:17.09]The only thing I order at the whole restaurant.
[73:19.09]Nothing else.
[73:21.75]Dude, tripping.
[73:22.59]Pizza Hut is garbage.
[73:25.53]Have you had the stuffed crust pizza?
[73:26.99]Have you had a stuffed crust pepperoni pizza from Pizza Hut?
[73:29.23]I understand your concerns here.
[73:31.93]Have you ever gone, I know, like, oh, I had a pizza at Pizza Hut, it sucked.
[73:35.67]Yes, but answer my question.
[73:37.67]Have you ever had a stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut?
[73:43.13]If you have not, you need to rethink it a little bit.
[73:50.35]Even if you hate Pizza Hut,
[73:53.43]only thing that is on the menu that I order it's just like Taco Bell and Taco Bell let's just put it up there because I'm going to right like let's just do it let's do it now because this is where it belongs the cheesy gordita crunch is the single best menu item on any fast food restaurant that has ever come out across every country on Earth
[74:19.74]Everything else at Taco Bell can suck.
[74:22.90]Can be disgusting and worthless.
[74:25.30]It does not matter.
[74:26.30]It doesn't fucking matter.
[74:27.84]It doesn't matter.
[74:29.14]Cheesy Godita Crunch puts this up here just on its own.
[74:32.56]It carries the whole rest of the team.
[74:36.04]The entire team.
[74:39.45]The Cheesy Godita Crunch scored like 100 points in the basketball game and everybody else on the team was sleeping on the court.
[74:48.34]They still won the game, didn't they?
[74:50.10]Doesn't matter.
[74:50.52]It has to be there.
[75:00.71]Like Quidditch.
[75:02.79]Yeah.
[75:03.71]And Team fucking Gryffindor won that match.
[75:11.18]Like Quidditch.
[75:14.02]I fucking love this place.
[75:16.16]There are times when I know I've eaten Taco Bell yesterday, and I sit there and I go... Fuck it, I'm doing it again.
[75:25.98]Doesn't happen that often, but... It is the only place that I will reliably say I would eat that instead of the local Mexican restaurants.
[75:37.64]It's the only one.
[75:40.04]It's the only exception.
[75:44.19]Local Mexican restaurants are so good and you put Taco Bell up in S tier.
[75:49.26]I have very, very specific reasons why though.
[75:51.38]Very specific.
[75:58.72]That, oh, especially, holy shit, if you get the Doritos taco, if you get the, you want to talk about this shit goes up?
[76:06.04]This shit goes into the stratosphere.
[76:08.41]Aliens, aliens wouldn't even see this.
[76:10.41]It's going to go so high into the goddamn cosmos.
[76:12.65]If you put the Doritos Locos taco in the cheesy gordita crunch, it can't even be on the list anymore.
[76:19.39]It'd be gone.
[76:21.14]You would think I removed it.
[76:22.24]In fact, we should take it off.
[76:30.12]I haven't had it.
[76:31.50]Ever.
[76:31.94]And I always say I want it.
[76:34.50]I say I always want it.
[76:35.52]I always say I want it.
[76:39.06]But I've never got it.
[76:39.62]I've never eaten it.
[76:42.34]And I really do feel like if I had, if I did eat it, that it would probably be up here.
[76:48.15]I've seen, like, I've seen other people eat it.
[76:50.91]I've seen, like, commercials.
[76:52.71]And I'm just like, holy shit, that's right up my alley.
[76:55.57]But I've never eaten it.
[76:57.69]They have the fries you like.
[76:59.15]Are you serious?
[77:06.12]Wait, hold on, explain it to me.
[77:08.27]What are the fries like at... Are you kidding me?
[77:22.95]Are these the fries that I... Are these the actual fries that I like?
[77:25.65]Oh my god, they are, aren't they?
[77:33.73]I'm eating this tonight.
[77:34.47]I'm gonna get it tonight.
[77:37.81]Yeah.
[77:38.87]Type Popeye's fries and go to images.
[77:42.96]Holy shit.
[77:43.68]This is exactly what I want.
[77:44.84]This is the exact thing.
[77:46.32]The orange French fry and they're crunchy and they're crispy.
[77:51.72]Holy shit.
[77:52.54]This is precisely what I want.
[77:54.22]Alright.
[77:55.23]This is going up.
[77:55.83]This is going up here.
[77:56.71]I don't even care if I've never eaten it.
[77:58.29]It's going up here because like it just has the French.
[78:00.37]It has the absolute best French fry you could possibly want.
[78:03.09]It's going up there.
[78:03.95]I don't even I know what those taste like.
[78:05.45]I can put it up here.
[78:11.81]Holy shit, this is unbelievable.
[78:19.57]Let me show you.
[78:20.01]Let me show you here.
[78:31.20]This is what I was talking about.
[78:38.04]Where is it?
[78:48.46]That is exactly what I want.
[78:53.48]I know what they taste like.
[79:00.30]I know the exact sound that those make too.
[79:03.66]It's like... So Popeye's is going up here.
[79:11.59]Just because I know what those taste like.
[79:12.77]Okay.
[79:16.57]Let's continue.
[79:19.59]Fortilos?
[79:22.09]Hotbelly?
[79:22.65]I think I've only had Qdoba once.
[79:28.58]Quiznos, oh man, the honey bacon club from Quiznos puts this up here.
[79:34.24]But I have not had it in a long time.
[79:42.07]Did Quiznos go out of business?
[79:51.82]Stop moving McDonald's.
[79:53.30]It's dynamic.
[79:53.86]It's going to be moving around.
[79:54.64]I have to make sure it's in the right place.
[79:57.22]Quiznos is bankrupt.
[80:02.44]What a fucking unfair world.
[80:04.06]What an unfair world that Quiznos has to go away, but Subway continues to be on every other street corner.
[80:12.90]What world are we in?
[80:15.66]Why?
[80:16.26]That seems so unbelievably unfair.
[80:18.48]And because of that, it's going up into S tier.
[80:21.58]I can't believe it.
[80:23.48]That place was incredible.
[80:24.42]It was the best fast food sub place I've ever had.
[80:31.65]What happened?
[80:35.17]Cane's?
[80:37.37]Cane's is very, very good.
[80:39.73]Cane's is very good.
[80:41.81]And Cane's, in fact, is probably going up here.
[80:57.58]I would absolutely rather have Cane's than anything on this list.
[81:01.84]Yeah, I think so.
[81:06.20]It might even level up here.
[81:07.79]It's possible.
[81:10.67]Cane's is the best fast food restaurant.
[81:12.49]Well, it's one of them because it's obviously top four right now.
[81:17.69]Boston Market cannot be in my top five favorite fast food restaurants.
[81:21.84]I haven't had it in like fucking 10 years.
[81:25.44]Because of that reason, it's going down here.
[81:38.14]It gets hometown advantage.
[81:39.46]Yeah, I can't.
[81:42.08]No.
[81:44.07]Rita's.
[81:47.03]Roy Rogers.
[81:47.99]I just know the drink Roy Rogers.
[81:49.45]I've never eaten there.
[81:50.93]Sbarro's.
[81:51.59]This is the pizza that you see at every airport and every mall.
[81:54.35]It's okay.
[81:55.84]I think it's alright.
[81:57.10]I would say it's better than Pizza Hut.
[82:04.48]We'll see.
[82:07.66]Shake Shack.
[82:08.56]I remember Shake Shack was in S tier.
[82:12.42]The last time I did this, I said Shake Shack was the best burger of any restaurant, like fast food or other, that I've had.
[82:19.78]But I need to update it.
[82:21.50]I need to update it.
[82:27.80]This has dropped for me.
[82:30.46]It's still very good.
[82:32.88]But the last few times I've had it, something changed.
[82:38.83]It was okay.
[82:39.75]It was very... When I say okay, I mean it was very, very good.
[82:45.09]There's something different about it the last year or two.
[82:47.41]I don't know.
[82:50.58]It's dropping.
[82:51.38]It came down.
[82:55.96]Sheets?
[82:57.38]Never had it.
[82:59.10]Smash Burger?
[82:59.92]I want it, but I've never had it.
[83:02.98]Smoothie King?
[83:03.72]I don't think I've ever had it.
[83:05.44]Sonic?
[83:06.76]It's fucking horrible.
[83:07.82]It's horrible.
[83:10.74]All the wonderful drinks at Sonic try desperately to push this up here.
[83:15.75]But when you eat, like, for the fifth time in a row, just cold food, it's just like, no, fucking stay down there.
[83:27.07]I'm not kidding.
[83:29.05]I'm not trying to say anything bad, but I have to be honest.
[83:33.83]I have never had hot food from Sonic.
[83:37.15]I've only had it like four or five times maybe in my life.
[83:40.89]I have never had food that was even remotely warm from this place.
[83:45.85]Ever.
[83:46.95]Not one time.
[83:50.12]Even if the food's good, it's not allowed to be up there.
[83:59.81]You only get drinks at Sonic.
[84:01.43]Okay, can we split Sonic into two different companies?
[84:05.83]Can it be like Sonic Food and Sonic Drink?
[84:08.47]Because Sonic Drink is like up here.
[84:14.64]Sonic Drink is probably somewhere up in this area, I'd say, at least.
[84:20.14]But the whole rest of the whole restaurant is fucking awful.
[84:25.77]In fact, I think Sonic could probably save a bunch of money and like redo their whole business as just being like a dessert drive-thru place.
[84:34.06]I feel like way more people would care.
[84:35.46]Add more like desserts.
[84:40.30]Have it be like a cool dessert drink drive-thru place.
[84:46.10]Because if it was just that, it's up here.
[84:50.53]It really is.
[84:50.97]It's good.
[84:52.43]But I cannot give that rating.
[84:53.91]It's not fair to do that.
[85:00.17]The drinks are, like, A tier.
[85:02.51]Everything else, oof.
[85:05.39]This place sucks, too.
[85:11.62]Have I become, like, a coffee, like, snob or something?
[85:17.22]Like, I... Again, over-expansion, right?
[85:25.85]Right?
[85:28.66]Starbucks has got, this is, okay.
[85:31.79]Starbucks has gotten to the point where there are so many of them that they're now infiltrating grocery stores, targets, like malls, like, what?
[85:46.19]They have five locations in a mile radius.
[85:49.61]That's not enough.
[85:50.41]They need to be in your, they need to be in your target, in your grocery store, in your
[85:56.46]Like, gas stations.
[85:57.52]Like, why do they have to be... Why do you have to be in so many places?
[86:00.50]Why?
[86:05.35]Like, when I go to, like, a Target, it's just like... There's a Starbucks in here.
[86:11.23]It has just attached itself to every single other business.
[86:16.61]Relax.
[86:18.07]Alright.
[86:18.49]Alright, man.
[86:18.93]Alright.
[86:19.65]Alright.
[86:19.95]I'm going to relax.
[86:20.42]Alright.
[86:21.95]In your house.
[86:22.59]Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if one day I just like walked out of my bedroom and there was a kiosk over here.
[86:28.97]Just sitting like in the hallway.
[86:31.91]What can I get you?
[86:34.89]I fucking don't want a Starbucks right now.
[86:38.92]I'm going to go down to the bathroom and like use the bathroom and like wash my hands and like fucking coffee is going to come out of the faucet.
[86:46.24]And this is just gonna be a counter, like a money counter, just of how much money I'm spending by using my own fucking toilet.
[86:53.37]I'm gonna flush the toilet and the coffee's gonna go down the toilet.
[87:02.37]Starbucks, I've had it many, many times.
[87:07.18]But holy shit, it does, like, it's in too many places.
[87:13.72]It's so, it's too much.
[87:18.32]That's not coffee, dude.
[87:19.22]That's poo-poo.
[87:30.31]All I'm saying is... When you expand so much... What happens when you can't expand anymore?
[87:43.48]There's a point where there's no longer any further you can go.
[87:47.18]They're in every fucking store.
[87:51.34]You, then you win.
[87:54.38]So, it's like, is Starbucks gonna go on to, like, the Nasdaq or whatever, like, one of these days, and just, like, smash the gavel and be like, Boom!
[88:02.23]We won!
[88:03.67]We win!
[88:05.79]And then, like, they're gonna just take the D-list, the stock?
[88:08.57]What, uh, you know what I mean?
[88:09.45]What the fuck is gonna happen?
[88:12.32]I just want everyone to know that, yeah, Starbucks, we are in every single location.
[88:16.79]We're in everybody's house.
[88:18.13]We're attached to everybody's skateboards and bicycles.
[88:20.65]We have a nozzle on the back of your hose, on the back of your house.
[88:24.49]We win.
[88:27.27]And then, yeah, they'll move on to do something else.
[88:30.10]It'll be, it's going to be like fucking Starbucks Prime.
[88:35.36]No, I got to get Starbucks Prime.
[88:36.48]Yeah, they're going to ship me my fucking, like, they're going to ship me my fucking deodorant that I ordered.
[88:40.56]They're going to start getting the shipping business.
[88:52.79]The coffee's okay.
[88:53.45]I thought you meant, like, like, Optimus Prime.
[89:04.98]What, every Starbucks comes together?
[89:07.36]That's the big master plan?
[89:10.38]They just, like, press the button that activates every Starbucks building, and they all come together in, like, Minecraft block, make a gigantic transformer, and, like, take over the fucking galaxy?
[89:26.41]It's all operated by like baristas doing like espresso machines.
[89:29.79]It's like steam powered.
[89:37.54]Anyways.
[89:40.60]I've never had it.
[89:41.66]I know people love this shit, but I've never had it.
[89:44.84]I've seen a bunch of these.
[89:49.55]Well, here's a great way you can call me out on my bullshit, right?
[89:52.77]You want to see, like, you want to, like, compare data?
[89:55.76]See how much of a liar I possibly am, right?
[89:59.28]I did this, like, three years ago, and I'm updating it.
[90:02.92]Did I, like, fake Andy, like, pretend that this place was good because everybody likes it and put it, like, up here?
[90:08.12]Like, oh, yeah, Steak 'n Shake.
[90:10.87]It's good shit, man.
[90:11.73]Like, did I, like, fake pretend, like, pander Andy, everybody?
[90:18.42]Because now you can, like, compare this list, especially to, like, places that I don't really remember eating, and be like, he put, he put, like, Steak 'n Shake there.
[90:36.35]You did that with Popeye's.
[90:46.39]Yeah, this is illegal.
[90:47.21]It can't be there.
[90:50.02]I have never eaten it.
[90:50.74]I can't say I like the way the menu looks and put it in A tier.
[90:54.31]That's not fair.
[90:56.09]That's so unfair.
[91:01.20]I hate this place.
[91:02.00]I'm sorry.
[91:25.37]I was standing in front of a subway one time.
[91:28.95]And there were other restaurants like around this place.
[91:32.53]I was really hungry.
[91:35.27]And I looked up the other restaurant on like Yelp.
[91:40.69]And this shit had like a three on Yelp.
[91:43.61]Like a three, four.
[91:45.89]I was like, oh.
[91:50.06]Oh, I don't know about that.
[91:55.39]And I didn't go to the subway.
[92:09.55]Alright, I'm going to say this too.
[92:11.01]I probably said this before.
[92:14.98]Oh, I'm going to be elitist Andy.
[92:17.26]No, I'm not.
[92:19.34]If you don't have at least a high 3 or a 4.0, at least I'm not going to your restaurant.
[92:29.98]Like, you gotta have at least like a high 3.
[92:33.62]I refuse to go.
[92:34.96]I'm not going to go.
[92:45.12]None of these count, by the way.
[92:48.05]Because you want to do an experiment?
[92:52.03]Go type in McDonald's into your Google Maps or Apple Maps or whatever, right?
[93:00.56]And try to find a McDonald's or any of these fast food kind of restaurants, right?
[93:05.62]That are over like a 2.5.
[93:08.42]They're all like 2.6, yeah.
[93:11.16]All these fast food restaurants match my GPA that I had in fucking like high school and college.
[93:21.45]I'm talking about like a non-chain restaurant.
[93:25.74]If you're a non-chain restaurant and you don't have at least like a 3637 on like Google and Yelp, I'm not eating it.
[93:34.88]I'm not going to eat there.
[93:37.20]It's very powerful.
[93:38.04]It's incredibly powerful.
[93:48.31]45, 43, 48.
[93:49.85]What's wrong with your McDonald's?
[93:53.85]Wait, you guys have high-ranking McDonald's near you?
[93:58.50]My local one's a 3.5.
[93:59.84]What?
[94:00.56]Why is every McDonald's I've been to like a 2, a 1?
[94:04.32]Like a 1.5.
[94:04.80]It's because you live in a city.
[94:14.70]My McDonald's has a 3.8.
[94:16.26]What?
[94:18.62]It's because you live in Las Vegas.
[94:29.31]I think most of the McDonald's around here, I think have like high twos or like mid twos.
[94:37.32]Or at least three or low threes.
[94:40.56]Hold on, I gotta fucking see.
[94:51.94]Yours is 3.9?
[94:53.44]No way!
[94:54.32]I don't believe that.
[94:56.16]Everybody f- look, the reason why I'm saying this is not because all these- those restaurants are like twos, it's because people find reasons to fucking hate fast food restaurants.
[95:08.47]I don't know what it is, but like, you will read some of these reviews and you will- I- I- I'll be- okay.
[95:14.28]I'll be like in the drive-thru and you like overhear the things that people are saying, and it's just like, why is this person such a dick?
[95:23.58]Like, what is it with people that are like, I don't understand.
[95:28.42]Like, let me tell you something.
[95:30.12]There was a ketchup packet that wasn't put in my bag.
[95:33.91]And the food's fucking awful.
[95:35.25]It was awful, by the way.
[95:36.67]It wasn't like the most high quality five star restaurant food that I come to expect when I pay good money for something.
[95:42.51]It's like, dude, you're at McDonald's.
[95:43.95]Like, what are you talking about?
[95:46.80]People put, like, fast food on this, like, fucking insane pedestal.
[95:52.86]Where it's like... Is that burger Angus beef?
[95:58.68]Better be.
[95:59.64]It's like, what?
[96:00.14]It's fucking McDonald's, man.
[96:01.20]Relax.
[96:01.72]It's like Burger King.
[96:04.10]And a lot of those workers are, like, trying to fucking help you.
[96:09.97]Like, I feel for some of these fucking workers.
[96:12.97]Seriously.
[96:14.07]Because...
[96:15.73]Man, you hear the stories of people that just... You just... Mean, just shit people through the fucking drive-thru.
[96:20.54]People fucking with the restaurant and stuff.
[96:23.66]Holy shit, man.
[96:32.31]Give me your money.
[96:36.65]Why did I read that person?
[96:37.93]Anyways.
[96:39.35]Anyways.
[96:42.32]I've never had Taco Bueno.
[96:44.80]I've never had this.
[96:45.44]I've never had this.
[96:47.24]I've never had this.
[96:49.01]I've never had this.
[96:51.15]I don't live in Canada.
[96:54.55]I've never had this.
[96:55.21]I've never had Waffle House.
[96:59.27]I've never had Wawa.
[97:01.17]I've had Wendy's.
[97:13.66]This is not done.
[97:15.62]It's not done.
[97:16.48]I'm not done.
[97:17.73]I've not had Wawa.
[97:27.01]This is unfair, though, because I'm biased towards Mexican food.
[97:31.71]Would I rather have Wendy's or Del Taco?
[97:35.50]I'm completely biased to Mexican food.
[97:40.70]So, I would probably rather go to Del Taco.
[97:44.18]Or Taco Bell.
[97:45.82]Or fast food.
[97:50.78]You put Wendy's behind Del Taco because of fries.
[97:55.98]I would rather go to a Mexican restaurant than a burger restaurant.
[97:59.96]I just told you that Mexican food is my number one favorite food of all the genres.
[98:09.13]It goes Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian.
[98:13.90]Done.
[98:16.98]Or some of those, sometimes depending on the day, that flips.
[98:23.73]I've not had Whataburger.
[98:27.15]White Castle is, like, should be here, but I've never really had it.
[98:31.81]I've seen it in, like, the freezers.
[98:37.50]Wait, I think maybe I've had it once.
[98:40.52]Some of these places that I just don't remember eating, I've had maybe one time.
[98:46.31]Fuck.
[98:48.87]Which... Which... Which sandwiches?
[98:55.11]Never had Wienerschnitzel.
[98:57.95]I've never had Wingstop.
[98:59.13]I don't know what this place is.
[99:01.79]I don't know what this place is.
[99:11.19]I never had, wait, no, I never had it.
[99:15.66]Okay.
[99:16.64]It's time to clean this up a little bit.
[99:19.68]And get this in a spot where I'm comfortable.
[99:32.25]We gotta start at the bottom.
[99:34.15]You have, this is, I've been here for two hours?
[99:35.67]Holy shit, this is a lot of fun.
[99:37.59]I like, I love this.
[99:38.57]This is great fun.
[99:42.11]Oh, fucking blast.
[99:43.11]I love this.
[99:43.49]Alright, Subway.
[99:49.51]We have so many more things to do today.
[99:52.89]Look, this is the longest one because this has the most amount of things on it.
[99:56.21]This is probably arguably the most important to a lot of you.
[99:58.67]This is the big one, so we're going to do the big one first.
[100:01.64]You know what I'm saying?
[100:02.94]Alright, Subway and Sonic.
[100:04.82]I would probably rather... I would rather go to Subway than Sonic just because I know the food will be fucking warm.
[100:12.26]I just really hate to say it, but I do mean that.
[100:16.08]I'd rather go to Subway than Dunkin' Donuts.
[100:19.16]But I don't know if I would put Dunkin' Donuts down.
[100:20.86]It's disgusting.
[100:23.40]I know this is so itchy.
[100:26.08]Would I rather go to Subway than Domino's?
[100:42.94]I don't think so.
[100:45.52]Would I rather go to Burger King or Domino's?
[100:47.74]Burger King.
[100:53.70]Yeah, I can say that.
[100:54.64]Would I rather go to Burger King or Dairy Queen?
[101:01.78]I would rather go to Burger King.
[101:03.83]But... Does that mean that Dairy Queen should be down at poor?
[101:15.61]Would I rather go to Domino's than Dairy Queen?
[101:19.87]Nope, because of the ice cream.
[101:21.31]That stays.
[101:30.88]Yeah.
[101:32.14]Would I rather go to Burger King than Cinnabon?
[101:36.58]Yeah, Cinnabon is just like a one menu Andy.
[101:39.56]Yeah, I probably would.
[101:40.68]Would I rather go to Dairy Queen than Cinnabon?
[101:42.20]Yes.
[101:49.34]That can stay an average.
[101:53.06]One menu item, Andy.
[101:57.07]But it's good.
[101:57.77]I just don't... If we're basing this on where I would rather go, or what I would deem to be better to go.
[102:04.45]I mean, I could just rate on the merits of just quality of the food.
[102:15.49]But then this shouldn't be up here.
[102:19.30]You know what I mean?
[102:20.38]I'm basing this on what I would prefer to do.
[102:22.50]Where I would want to go.
[102:23.50]Where I would go.
[102:24.24]I'm going to keep it for now.
[102:35.46]Alright, would I rather go to Burger King than Starbucks?
[102:41.12]Probably not.
[102:41.64]I'd probably rather go to Starbucks.
[102:46.19]Denny's or Starbucks?
[102:48.87]Starbucks.
[102:50.35]IHOP or Starbucks?
[102:51.79]What's better?
[102:52.39]Probably Starbucks.
[102:55.80]Hold on.
[102:56.20]We're moving a lot of people around here.
[102:58.36]Burger King or Denny's?
[102:59.42]I'd rather go to Burger King.
[103:00.46]No.
[103:00.84]I'd rather go to Denny's.
[103:02.24]No.
[103:02.80]Depends on the day.
[103:04.22]What time is it?
[103:07.88]What time is it right now?
[103:10.73]Is it over midnight?
[103:12.39]Is it like 2 a.m.?
[103:14.59]If it's 2 a.m., this is up here.
[103:17.95]If it's like 4 o'clock in the afternoon, it's like down here.
[103:25.48]This is hard.
[103:30.94]I would probably rather go to Denny's than Burger King.
[103:33.72]No, I wouldn't.
[103:37.91]I would rather go to Denny's than IHOP, that's for sure.
[103:40.03]So this has to go down here.
[103:46.39]Uh, do I think Arby's is better than Cold Stone?
[103:48.87]No.
[103:49.29]Do I think Starbucks is better than Arby's?
[103:50.65]Yes.
[103:53.01]Like in just like a quality and like food and like what I'd rather have.
[103:59.76]I'd rather go to Denny's than Arby's.
[104:00.92]I'd rather go to Burger King than Arby's.
[104:06.26]Would I rather go to... Do I think Dairy Queen's better than Arby's?
[104:09.71]Yes.
[104:11.95]Because they have ice cream.
[104:20.42]But Arby's too disgusting.
[104:29.84]Arby's has ice cream.
[104:31.54]Dairy Queen is known for their blizzards and ice cream.
[104:34.50]That's not the same.
[104:38.68]Are you wearing lipstick today?
[104:39.93]I am using chapstick because my lips get very dry.
[104:43.51]Thanks for reminding me to do it.
[104:50.46]Good.
[104:54.48]But Arby's has a funny Twitter.
[104:58.22]If you honestly think I give a shit about what is going on on a fast food Twitter, I don't fucking care.
[105:08.70]That's the last thing I can think of that I would care about.
[105:13.32]What does Arby's have to say about this?
[105:15.76]I...
[105:21.74]It's funny, I guess, right?
[105:23.00]Like, if they say something funny.
[105:25.62]But I'm not, like, actively searching for what, like, Dairy Queen had to say about something like a topic.
[105:30.91]I don't... Have you seen Twitter?
[105:38.34]Guys, I'm on social media maybe once or twice a month, maybe.
[105:45.25]I like Twitter, Discord, it doesn't matter.
[105:50.33]I don't use social media really that much at all.
[105:55.16]So if I miss the cool thing that Burger King said, I'm going to miss it.
[106:00.66]Make a tier below disgusting and put Arby's in it.
[106:03.48]No, because I don't, I can't speak to that.
[106:05.68]I've had it a few times and I don't remember it being like horrendous.
[106:09.82]I remember it was just, it was fine.
[106:13.14]And that's sometimes all you want is fine.
[106:15.66]You don't need to have every single restaurant.
[106:18.47]Everything in average is not bad.
[106:21.95]It's stuff that I would eat.
[106:23.23]If you presented me with a Jimmy John's sandwich right now and said, would you eat that?
[106:29.01]I'd go,
[106:30.76]Yeah.
[106:32.40]Yeah, I would.
[106:34.15]If you presented me with a fresh Cinnabon, I'd go, yeah, sure, I'll take it.
[106:39.53]If you presented me with a roast grilled cheese from Friendly's.
[106:47.36]Yeah.
[107:00.50]I'd eat it, but I wouldn't be very happy about it.
[107:06.38]But Friendly's shouldn't... Friendly's is like a restaurant for kids.
[107:11.51]Okay, Friendly's is a place where the whole menu is the kids menu.
[107:18.26]I'm doing it, I think, a little bit of a disservice here by putting it here.
[107:31.11]But I think I'm going to keep it here.
[107:32.09]It's a great place to take, like, kids.
[107:35.81]I've been to a few, at least three or four friendlies before in my life.
[107:40.25]And the people were really nice.
[107:42.25]They were really, you know, if you go with, like, a couple of kids, it's like they come and get milkshakes.
[107:46.03]And, like, the staff was really friendly.
[107:47.73]And everyone was like, it was fine.
[107:48.91]It was good.
[107:49.27]It was fine.
[107:53.86]So I'm not going to put it down here.
[107:55.74]I don't think it deserves to be down there.
[108:00.85]It's a place to get like an ice cream and bring like the kids to have like a lunch or something.
[108:04.73]And the kids get to go to a restaurant.
[108:07.13]Excuse me, I'm putting this up.
[108:09.43]They give you the little thing with the crayons.
[108:12.39]They give you a piece of paper with like activities and quizzes on it and stuff.
[108:16.61]Yeah, this is not fair at all.
[108:18.49]It's unfair.
[108:20.90]This is a nice place.
[108:22.54]It's a really just nice little place.
[108:31.39]I'll fix it later.
[108:37.03]Every time I've gone to friendlies, the response from the children was, that was great.
[108:45.07]That was a great time.
[108:46.75]And if that's what they're trying to do, then no, they're not going to go down here.
[108:51.57]No, they're not.
[108:57.63]What children?
[108:58.59]I...
[109:01.29]Guys, I have nieces and nephews.
[109:02.97]I have, like, siblings.
[109:04.81]It's a place to take the kids!
[109:11.88]Okay.
[109:13.78]I gotta hurry up, because we have, like, 30 things to do.
[109:16.70]And I'm already, like, on this for three hours.
[109:21.63]Cold Stone is good, but it's hard to rate the ice cream places.
[109:27.69]Because they only do ice cream.
[109:28.99]It's hard to do this.
[109:31.09]So I'm just going to say I probably would go to Starbucks.
[109:34.79]I would probably go to Panera.
[109:37.45]Yeah, I'd go to Panera.
[109:39.75]Friendly's, yeah, I mean, of course.
[109:41.19]Take those kids.
[109:42.91]Chipotle can stay here.
[109:44.61]Moe's can stay here.
[109:45.40]Einstein Brothers Bagels needs to come way up.
[109:47.42]Little Caesar has to come way down.
[109:51.70]Jason's Deli needs to go down as well.
[109:55.10]I would actually have to put these here.
[109:57.32]And I would rather go to Panera.
[109:59.66]Like, just straight up.
[110:05.42]They are, they are like equal in my brain, but I would, that cheddar broccoli soup from Panera, you just, I can't, you can't beat it.
[110:17.81]I'm imagining me going into Jason's Deli and getting like what I would order at Jason's Deli, and then the cheddar broccoli soup in a bread bowl.
[110:25.96]And I want that more.
[110:32.84]What are you eating at Starbucks?
[110:35.66]Like I said, that's why it's hard to do some of these restaurants that only have one product.
[110:40.11]Alright.
[110:45.31]Little Caesars.
[110:46.35]These are kind of on the same... These are all on the same tier for me, I think.
[110:50.00]These are on the same tier, but I'd rather go here.
[110:52.93]I'd rather go here than all these places combined.
[110:56.33]I'd rather go to KFC.
[110:58.35]I'd rather go to KFC than Pizza Hut.
[111:01.61]I'd rather go to Einstein Brothers Bagels than all these.
[111:04.88]Sbarro's good.
[111:10.20]Where do I put Jack in the Box?
[111:12.28]I would probably rather go to KFC than Jack.
[111:16.26]No, I wouldn't.
[111:16.90]Those little mini tacos.
[111:19.30]Holy shit.
[111:22.23]A little mini ones.
[111:23.31]It's like taco popcorn.
[111:35.38]Fuddruckers is coming down a little bit because to me Fuddruckers is... It's like an attraction restaurant to me.
[111:43.14]I've been to a couple of attractions that had a Fuddruckers there.
[111:51.35]and I've never seen it anywhere else and I think I've only had I think it was like it was good it was I think I've only had it like once though twice maybe I don't remember how much I liked it but I would probably I would rather go here if I'm honest
[112:21.40]Alright, this is where it gets interesting.
[112:22.66]Would I rather go to Jack in the Box?
[112:27.59]I'd rather go to... I'd rather go to Moe's than Blaze Pizza.
[112:32.25]Blaze Pizza I think is lower than Moe's.
[112:34.39]Jimmy John's has to come way down.
[112:36.28]Krispy Kreme come way down.
[112:38.52]Jersey Mike's way down.
[112:46.67]These are only down here because they're just... You go get a donut.
[112:50.67]You go get a Cinnabon.
[112:54.24]What do you want me to do?
[112:57.14]They're good, but it's like there's only one thing you can do.
[113:02.28]Firehouse does not stay.
[113:03.32]Firehouse is going to move.
[113:15.61]Do a dessert category.
[113:17.33]That's probably not a bad idea.
[113:19.55]That's not a bad idea.
[113:21.49]To just have dessert be a separate category.
[113:23.71]But is there even enough to do a separate category?
[113:25.97]One, two, three, four, five.
[113:28.13]There is.
[113:28.55]Okay.
[113:33.14]Play Elden Ring.
[113:33.94]It's not out yet.
[113:37.22]And I'm going to piss my pants.
[113:39.08]I've been drinking fucking coffee.
[113:41.24]I'll be right back.
[113:45.16]BRB.
[116:00.82]Thank you.
[119:57.35]I have returned.
[120:07.60]How are you?
[120:08.14]Alright, what were we doing?
[120:20.09]Oh yeah, I was showing you my awesome tier list that everyone's going to agree with.
[120:33.87]So, oh, whatever.
[120:36.84]I got to get the top done, right?
[120:44.98]Do another tier list.
[120:47.20]I have a lot of tier lists.
[120:48.54]We're going to have to go quick for some of these.
[120:55.04]I think I like this.
[120:56.16]I like how this is.
[120:56.96]I would rather go to Jack in the Box than Annie Ants.
[121:03.50]I probably would rather go... I don't know if I would rather go to Jollibee.
[121:08.67]It's good, but not Sabara.
[121:10.95]I think this is accurate.
[121:16.29]You need to put a time limit on yourself?
[121:17.73]I don't have to put a time limit.
[121:19.51]Look, I'm going to be live for a while.
[121:21.67]I said a few hours, but I should have said several.
[121:26.55]I should have said several hours.
[121:28.17]Because this is going to be a lot longer than I think it is.
[121:41.89]I'm so burpy.
[121:43.01]Fuck.
[121:43.74]Okay.
[121:45.10]Alright, let's go.
[121:45.88]Let's do it.
[121:47.30]I'd rather go to Del Taco than Wendy's.
[121:49.46]I just would.
[121:50.14]I would rather go to In-N-Out than Del Taco.
[121:52.84]I think that Boston Market probably can stay there.
[121:56.12]That's just bias from the part of the country that I have lived in most of my life.
[122:02.28]So I don't know if it should be there.
[122:03.76]I would... Five Guys...
[122:15.42]Hains is so good.
[122:23.53]This is a battle because I've had both of these pretty re- I've had them pretty recently.
[123:02.73]Ben and Jerry's just, Ben and Jerry's shouldn't be up here.
[123:05.81]I, I like eating the pints of Ben and Jerry's from the grocery store.
[123:09.85]This shouldn't be up here.
[123:11.27]I'm going to keep it here, but I'm going to move it because like it honestly shouldn't be here.
[123:15.93]This is really what it probably looks like.
[123:17.67]We're just, this is because like nostalgia purposes, this is here.
[123:20.97]Here you go.
[123:23.65]I have completed my updated tier list.
[123:42.64]Quiznos being too high.
[123:51.05]The reason, okay, the reason why Canes is number one is I just imagined myself taking that hot dog roll Texas toast thing and dunking it in the sauce and biting it.
[124:06.34]And it was a far better experience than everything else on this whole list.
[124:13.50]On the whole list.
[124:16.44]So that's why I think it deserves to be there on my updated list.
[124:25.13]Hainsaw sucks.
[124:29.01]What do we do with him?
[124:31.99]You decide.
[124:32.79]What do we do with him?
[124:33.83]What do we do with him?
[124:35.91]What do we do with him?
[124:39.06]That's really cross-eyed.
[124:40.88]What do we do with that guy?
[124:43.02]What do we do with him?
[124:45.91]What do we do with that guy?
[124:53.75]You guys didn't know I could move one eye?
[125:11.53]Don't do that, it like, it sucks.
[125:16.06]Stop, I can- Oh shit, I forgot!
[125:20.38]I forgot there's a screencap feature.
[125:23.46]New meme.
[125:31.51]Yeah, what did it look like?
[125:32.73]I already regret it.
[125:34.37]Yeah, I regret it already.
[125:43.60]Can I see it?
[125:51.09]When the cane sauce hits.
[126:01.00]Hold on.
[126:02.08]I'm gonna get out of here.
[126:04.46]I'm leaving.
[126:21.28]With the cane sausage.
[126:23.36]Oh, no.
[126:45.87]I gotta zoom in.
[126:46.63]Hold on.
[126:47.29]No, I can't.
[126:47.85]I'll mess up the whole thing.
[126:52.07]Okay.
[126:52.71]I'm moving on to the next list.
[126:57.96]Here's my final thoughts on that one.
[127:00.76]There it is.
[127:06.28]That's the new worst face.
[127:10.10]I don't think it consequences for any of my actions, unfortunately.
[127:13.94]Here you go.
[127:14.87]It has been completed.
[127:25.10]There it is.
[127:26.04]There is my official updated list.
[127:28.50]We're going to move on to the next one.
[127:31.60]Take a look.
[127:31.94]There you go.
[127:32.28]If you want your screenshot, there it is.
[127:35.42]What do you think about that?
[127:40.75]Oh, wait.
[127:41.55]I was facing the wrong way.
[127:42.69]Who cares?
[127:44.77]This next one is an update called Best Fruits.
[127:49.02]I've done this already.
[127:49.74]Let's see if I can... Let's see.
[127:51.00]This is going to take a long time.
[127:56.41]This is going to take a while.
[127:57.31]I've been eating a lot more fruits.
[127:59.77]I've been eating a lot more vegetables and fruits lately.
[128:03.60]I'm going to see... We'll compare it to the last one.
[128:07.54]I'm going to do this very quick.
[128:09.44]Okay?
[128:10.28]Lemon.
[128:11.48]S. Banana.
[128:14.06]S. Hair.
[128:17.28]B. Green apple.
[128:19.52]A. Red apple.
[128:21.24]D. Fuck red apples.
[128:23.59]Apricots.
[128:25.48]I don't really eat it.
[128:26.22]I've never had one.
[128:26.84]Avocado.
[128:28.36]B. Blackberry.
[128:33.00]Flavor.
[128:33.92]S. Practice.
[128:37.01]C. I don't like the fucking popcorn shells you get in your mouth.
[128:40.27]All the berries.
[128:41.85]Raspberries.
[128:42.95]Blackberries.
[128:45.71]Any of the berries that have the seeds.
[128:47.65]Because you'll bite them.
[128:48.55]You'll eat them.
[128:49.80]And you get the fucking popcorn shells.
[128:53.49]And it's like, oh, I feel like a little like hard ball.
[128:58.27]Don't like it.
[128:59.67]They taste phenomenal, though, but we're just going on.
[129:01.35]I have to be fair to myself.
[129:03.49]Kiwis, S. No, they're A.
[129:06.73]I've only ever had blackcurrant juice and blackcurrant jam.
[129:10.69]I've never actually eaten the real fruit, so I'm going to put it down here.
[129:13.25]Blueberry.
[129:14.77]That's going to be low A, and I'm putting blueberry in low A and not S where it belongs because blueberries are very interesting.
[129:23.18]They either are awful, like mushy and gross, or if you get a good pack, if you get good ones, they're unbelievable.
[129:30.84]They're better than anything in the world.
[129:33.34]So I have to take that into consideration.
[129:36.80]Cantaloupe.
[129:37.76]D. Worst.
[129:40.53]Absolute worst.
[129:42.75]I hate melon.
[129:43.49]I hate it.
[129:44.17]I think it's awful.
[129:45.99]Cantaloupe is the stuff, again, I'll say it again.
[129:47.65]I probably said this a few years ago.
[129:49.57]Cantaloupe is the stuff that you pick around in a fruit salad and you just leave.
[129:54.51]And then if you still are really, really hungry and you still... Whoa!
[130:00.40]If you're still really, really hungry, you'll eat those last if you really are still feeling it.
[130:07.52]Cherries, the actual fruit is probably like a C, but cherry juice and cherry stuff is higher, but I'm just basing- I'm basing this not on flavor.
[130:16.79]I'm basing this on if I were to eat this thing.
[130:20.41]So that means this should not be up here.
[130:22.41]But I do that shit.
[130:23.23]I'm a weirdo.
[130:26.45]I'm a weird motherfucker.
[130:27.87]I like- And go- Dragon fruit is- I think dragon fruit takes over lemon.
[130:40.10]But is it flavor?
[130:41.38]I think we have to take everything into consideration.
[130:47.44]Dragon fruit is what I want blackberries and raspberries to be.
[130:52.92]Because the little seeds in dragon fruit are wonderful.
[130:57.05]You bite into a dragon fruit and it's like this little nice crispy crunch go through the seed.
[131:03.81]It's so wonderful.
[131:05.13]You can't do that with blackberries and raspberries.
[131:09.02]Biting into a blackberry, it's like... Dragon fruit, it's like pillowy, little crispy seeds.
[131:19.44]I love dragon fruit.
[131:23.94]Coconut.
[131:25.74]The coconut flavor is F. But the coconut water, coconut milk, and coconut flavor is somewhere around here.
[131:34.68]So that's where we'll average it out.
[131:36.85]Cranberries.
[131:37.79]See you later.
[131:40.11]Flavor, S. Texture, S. Health factor, S. Tanginess, S. Sweetness, F. Ugh.
[132:04.63]I've never had it, but I know it smells...
[132:08.41]Uh, figs are... depends on how they're prepared.
[132:11.35]I'm gonna put them in C. Gooseberries, they got a funny name, but I've never had them.
[132:15.81]Grapefruit is F. Grapefruit just tastes like stomach acid.
[132:21.80]Uh, I think I've said this before, I've... I've had burps that taste better than grapefruit.
[132:29.82]I get to use that joke again, don't I?
[132:35.21]Uh, okay, grapes.
[132:37.39]Grapes are like blueberries.
[132:39.51]If you get really good, like, firm, juicy, cold grapes, they're amazing.
[132:44.65]But if you get the fucking wilty kind of, like, sludge kind, they can go really low.
[132:55.59]I love them, though.
[132:56.31]They're good.
[132:57.77]Especially frozen grapes.
[133:01.80]We might have to update this.
[133:04.42]Lime-esque?
[133:07.19]The only time I've ever had lychee is when it was in, like, a weird, like, booze drink.
[133:11.59]So, not really.
[133:13.01]Mango?
[133:13.83]Mmm.
[133:14.19]What could it be is alright.
[133:15.50]Nectarine?
[133:16.16]Excuse me.
[133:17.54]This goes up here.
[133:19.78]Orange the fruit sucks worse than probably everything.
[133:24.22]But the flavor is unbelievable.
[133:28.62]I hate eating oranges because of the weird, gross sinew that's in an orange.
[133:36.02]That, like, white sinew, like, it's like a fucking, like, no.
[133:42.50]Disgusting.
[133:45.64]I'm going to put it down at C because I love orange juice and I love orange flavor.
[133:50.95]But I cannot eat oranges.
[133:52.77]That's, like, weird.
[133:53.71]It's got that, okay, you know, like, a raw chicken?
[133:56.37]Like, the raw chicken, like, fat that's on it that you, like, kind of have to take off?
[134:01.01]That's what it's like on an orange.
[134:04.89]papaya I don't really I don't really eat papaya I don't really eat passion fruit it's just on every single box that has like tea in the name oh it's got passion fruit tea passion fruit like I don't know peaches are underneath nectarine but they're still really good although I'd probably put them down here but permission I don't know what that is pineapple is up here as well I love fruits as you can tell plums uh I like the way they taste but they're hard they're kind of like weird
[134:35.68]Pomegranate are also like weird alien fruits.
[134:40.03]But they taste really good.
[134:41.23]They're just hard to eat.
[134:42.05]I don't know.
[134:42.75]They're difficult to eat.
[134:48.01]I don't know what this is.
[134:49.83]Red current.
[134:50.25]I don't know what that is.
[134:50.79]I'm going to put it next to this one.
[134:52.84]Star fruit.
[134:53.84]I mean, like, if I was 12, I would probably put this higher because it's like a Super Mario star, but like, I don't really, I've never had it.
[134:59.84]I don't care.
[135:00.96]Strawberries up here somewhere.
[135:02.28]Probably, I would say, probably above, it's probably A. Tangerine gets to stay with orange because they have the both, they have the gross sinew bullshit.
[135:10.16]Watermelon is A at least.
[135:12.85]Honeydew melon, F.
[135:15.47]With cantaloupe, not as bad as grapefruit though.
[135:18.11]I've never really had an Asian pear.
[135:20.13]I've never really had guava.
[135:22.17]Blood orange, it's kind of just like a grosser version of a grapefruit.
[135:25.64]It's like just weird.
[135:26.44]Like, I don't know.
[135:28.26]It's like, it's too deep.
[135:30.56]It's too like, it's too heavy.
[135:34.26]Grapefruit, at least to me, has like that acidic taste.
[135:37.51]Blood orange has like the acidic taste and like the deep flavor.
[135:40.87]I don't like it.
[135:43.11]It's like an orange.
[135:44.71]It's like the sinew of the orange and the grossness of the grapefruit to me.
[135:51.39]Mm-mm.
[135:58.22]I mean, I like... The flavor is there for me, but it's just like the combination of how... I don't like citrus fruits, eating them like this.
[136:06.28]Unless I'm going to bite into a lemon and be a weirdo.
[136:09.12]The citrus fruits have all that gross shit in it.
[136:12.32]Especially oranges.
[136:13.98]And things in the orange family.
[136:17.56]Stop saying sinew.
[136:18.93]Why?
[136:19.07]Because it's a cool new word that I found out?
[136:23.01]What is a custard apple?
[136:24.17]I don't know.
[136:26.13]I've never had a kumquat.
[136:27.65]I've never had a mulberry.
[136:29.31]Raisins, if I'm in the mood for it, are very high.
[136:31.91]But you have to be in the mood for it.
[136:35.00]Jackfruit.
[136:37.18]Have I ever had jackfruit?
[136:38.30]Maybe like once.
[136:41.52]Sour cherry.
[136:43.08]I've not had really any of these.
[136:44.73]Alright, let's get this right.
[136:53.79]Bananas are... I don't know if I would... Dragon fruit is like here.
[136:58.67]Pineapple's higher than this.
[136:59.83]Pineapple's probably here.
[137:03.12]I would rather just eat a bowl of pineapples.
[137:05.42]I know it's got the bromelain in it, right?
[137:07.68]It kind of hurts your mouth after a while, but it's really good.
[137:13.23]I'd rather have a nectarine.
[137:15.00]I'd rather have a nectarine.
[137:16.92]That's good.
[137:19.08]You know when you get a good nectarine, when you need a napkin in your other hand to take one bite, because it's going to, you're going to get sprayed with like a super soaker.
[137:27.88]That's how you know it's a good one.
[137:33.63]That's just one of the, it's just the, it's arguably the best fruit, but I like bananas flavor a little better.
[137:43.19]Strawberry is... No, it's not.
[137:46.43]No, it's not.
[137:46.87]And you know why strawberry doesn't get to level up?
[137:48.73]And strawberry might actually come down.
[137:51.41]How many times have you gotten strawberries and it's just texture?
[137:55.39]There's just nothing there.
[137:56.19]You can't taste anything.
[137:58.92]Oh, a strawberry!
[137:59.78]A bite.
[138:01.02]Mmm!
[138:01.34]You don't taste anything.
[138:03.84]It's just like... You kind of can smell strawberry, but you don't taste strawberry.
[138:11.59]I'm going to put them down here because they live in the same world.
[138:14.91]They need to be really, really picked at the right time and in the right place for them to taste the way and be texturally the way that I want them to be.
[138:25.92]So it has to come down here.
[138:33.78]Green apple is so good.
[138:34.66]You know what's funny about green apple?
[138:37.46]The only reason why I like green apple is because of Jolly Ranchers.
[138:41.94]That's it.
[138:43.62]When I was younger, I loved green apple Jolly Ranchers to a point that it made me want to eat the fruit.
[138:51.60]And ever since, it's been my favorite apple.
[138:56.01]Red Delicious is S tier.
[138:57.29]Is that what you said?
[138:57.83]Because that's probably one of the most incorrect things I've ever heard.
[139:11.09]There's no nutritional value in Las Vegas.
[139:16.27]Strawberries have the same problem everywhere.
[139:18.51]Back when I was in Massachusetts, I had the same problem too.
[139:20.98]It's not like, oh, everything in Vegas is devoid of all flavor.
[139:26.20]No, what?
[139:29.04]Some of the best restaurants in the world that I've ever been to have been here.
[139:33.18]Excuse me.
[139:33.64]I'm going to have fucking a reason to stay.
[139:35.56]Okay.
[139:40.69]Okay.
[139:43.34]Kiwis are amazing.
[139:44.30]You know what I've come to realize?
[139:47.90]I love crunchy seeds that you can eat.
[139:51.56]I love that texture of biting into a kiwi and you get to the seed part and it's like that little crunch.
[139:56.92]I love it.
[140:03.73]I don't know.
[140:04.21]Avocado shouldn't be on here.
[140:05.47]I know it's a fruit, but it's not used the way that fruits are used.
[140:08.81]I'm taking it off the list.
[140:11.02]Avocado's a vegetable.
[140:12.89]And I know it's not.
[140:14.59]I know.
[140:15.33]But I don't care.
[140:18.59]Avocado is like A tier in a vegetable list.
[140:24.47]I don't put pineapple on my like cheeseburgers.
[140:28.16]I don't put like a slice of nectarine on like a sandwich.
[140:33.74]I'm just saying.
[140:41.69]That sounds good.
[140:42.35]It's literally not a vegetable, though.
[140:43.73]And where's tomato, then?
[140:45.73]Show me the tomato.
[140:46.41]Where's the tomato?
[140:49.84]Where's the tomato?
[140:53.86]You want to fight semantics on me here?
[140:56.90]Find me the tomato.
[141:05.93]Fine, it'll... Fine, it stays up here.
[141:14.20]I would probably rather eat an apple than an orange, a red apple.
[141:22.71]Little Macintosh apples are amazing, but nobody fucking has them.
[141:25.57]Nobody sells them.
[141:26.21]I don't know why.
[141:29.71]Why?
[141:30.17]How come I've not, why have I not been able to find a Macintosh little apple in like the last five years?
[141:36.70]Why?
[141:36.94]They're better.
[141:37.88]They're the best.
[141:42.49]No, even when I was in Massachusetts, I couldn't find them.
[141:52.55]I love Macintosh apples.
[141:53.77]They're the only red apple I like.
[141:56.74]Okay, I think this is good.
[141:59.60]I'm happy with this.
[142:01.58]Lemon-lime is just... It goes on everything.
[142:04.22]It goes well in everything.
[142:05.22]Lemon water.
[142:06.58]Lemon candies.
[142:08.34]Lemon... Like a slice of lemon on something.
[142:10.66]Like a squeeze of lime on stuff.
[142:13.73]I mean, you can't beat it.
[142:17.68]I think this is good.
[142:18.76]I'd rather have a nectarine than eating a banana.
[142:23.94]There it is.
[142:28.83]You just proved your avocado point wrong with lemon and lime.
[142:37.55]Ow.
[142:37.61]What do you mean?
[142:48.48]Macintosh sucks so bad.
[142:49.74]I'm still not over that.
[142:50.90]It's fucking... I love it.
[142:58.11]Would you just eat a lemon or a lime?
[143:00.35]Yes.
[143:03.19]Every time that there's a lemon or a lime from a restaurant that they put on the side or something, I always just go... Every time.
[143:13.24]I love it.
[143:16.14]Prove it.
[143:18.30]Do you really want me to prove this by biting into and enjoying a lime on stream?
[143:22.65]That's not hard to do.
[143:23.59]That's very easy.
[143:24.43]That's a very easy thing to do.
[143:25.51]It's not like eating a raw onion.
[143:32.31]Limes are not as harsh as a lemon is.
[143:36.04]It's not like biting into an onion.
[143:47.51]Okay, here you go.
[143:48.23]Let's move on to the next one.
[143:49.17]We did that one quick.
[143:50.53]That's good.
[143:50.87]Alright, this is a American Mammals tier list.
[143:57.50]Why am I even doing this one?
[143:58.50]Who cares?
[143:59.98]Who gives a shit?
[144:03.26]Who actually gives a shit about this one?
[144:07.42]You know what I mean?
[144:07.96]Like, who cares?
[144:08.60]Alright, how about we need some music?
[144:14.37]Yeah, we could use some music.
[144:21.53]What's an OST you want here?
[144:29.53]Mario Party OST?
[144:30.58]How about Deltarune?
[144:35.26]Oh yeah, that's not a bad one.
[144:36.02]That's not a bad one.
[144:39.20]That's not a bad one.
[144:49.40]Alright.
[144:50.84]It's nice and low.
[144:52.14]Just in the background.
[144:52.78]We don't need to be loud.
[144:55.08]Just a good chill in the background.
[144:56.30]You know what I'm saying?
[144:57.50]You know what I mean, Vern?
[145:01.41]Alright.
[145:01.87]Let's continue.
[145:03.69]Armadillo is S tier.
[145:06.47]What a cool animal.
[145:10.87]Badger.
[145:14.11]Okay, wait.
[145:14.91]What's the criteria here, though?
[145:16.95]Is it animals that I think are, like, cool?
[145:21.41]That I think are cool?
[145:22.47]Or what's, like, the strongest one?
[145:24.55]Just coolness factor.
[145:25.52]Okay.
[145:27.70]I can do coolness factor.
[145:28.58]How about... Alright.
[145:31.38]Bats are pretty cool.
[145:33.36]They're very cool, actually.
[145:35.54]Um... My dad is the only person other than you that says...
[145:41.19]You know what I mean, Vern?
[145:43.55]Well, your father is a hyper-intelligent individual who consumed countless hours of earnest.
[145:49.57]So, that's... Your dad is a very smart person.
[145:56.01]Uh, beaver, um... Beavers are, I would say, probably B tier.
[146:00.42]Sheep, bighorn sheep, C. Wisons, they're, like, big and cool.
[146:04.78]Blackbears, S. They're the cutest things in the world.
[146:08.54]They're just so... I just want to see if we have Otto.
[146:13.53]Bobcat.
[146:14.51]Hi, B. Caribou, C. Chipmunk is A, just because it's fun to watch them kind of scurry around and stuff.
[146:24.25]Yeah.
[146:25.96]Coyotes, B. Deer, B. Well, a baby deer is like, holy shit, what an adorable... The world is at peace right now when you look at a baby deer.
[146:40.29]But, hmm.
[146:47.88]Dolphins.
[146:49.82]Dolphins are kind of cool.
[146:52.36]All the horned mammals, I think, come down to about C for me.
[146:59.28]Fox, I feel like is S tier for too many people, which I'm a contrarian, so I'm going to put it down at C. Because I can't like the things that everybody else likes.
[147:07.45]How could I?
[147:08.09]I can't.
[147:08.43]I have to be the contrarian.
[147:10.51]I like armadillos.
[147:11.31]I'm different.
[147:12.25]I'm not like everybody else.
[147:14.67]Gophers are funny.
[147:17.10]Grizzly bears are just huge.
[147:19.30]Grizzly bears are the bear of the bear world, I think.
[147:24.14]So, they get to be up pretty high.
[147:26.98]Groundhogs and gophers are just like the same animal in my head, so.
[147:32.24]I don't even know what that is.
[147:35.85]A javelina?
[147:37.65]What's a javelina?
[147:43.01]Manatee is pretty high.
[147:45.57]We might upgrade the manatee.
[147:49.28]A Mar- Marmot?
[147:51.52]Eh, it's kind of like a beaver.
[147:53.42]Martin?
[147:53.80]It's kind of like a... It's like a ferret.
[147:57.08]Moles are S tier.
[147:58.44]They're so weird.
[147:59.48]What a strange animal.
[148:03.22]Moose?
[148:03.72]Get to upgrade from the horned animals list up to somewhere in B because they're just so huge.
[148:08.51]They're massive.
[148:09.47]It's interesting.
[148:12.99]What is that?
[148:14.09]What the fuck is that?
[148:14.93]I thought that was a dog.
[148:19.72]That looks like somebody drew like a Chad Brian the dog.
[148:24.51]It's a mountain goat?
[148:29.95]Why does it look so photoshopped?
[148:36.39]Mountain lion.
[148:37.19]You guys can hang out in the same place.
[148:39.07]Mouse.
[148:40.63]A tier.
[148:41.81]I love mice.
[148:42.63]I love mice and I love rats.
[148:45.69]Oh, a musk of the muskrat.
[148:50.06]Kind of cool.
[148:50.62]Possums are weird.
[148:51.88]Like, so, it's too weird to not be S. Oh, Otto!
[148:58.91]I love otters.
[148:59.85]I love when they go like this.
[149:05.25]I love, yeah.
[149:05.89]They, just because of this, is the reason why they're up here.
[149:09.23]Mmm.
[149:16.87]I mean, like the sea mammals are really cool.
[149:19.03]Whales go up really high.
[149:21.48]Just because this thing is just how does it even exist?
[149:24.44]This is a dinosaur.
[149:29.71]We have so many weird an- okay, when people talk about- I wonder what they- imagine like how crazy shit would look on other planets.
[149:36.40]Wow, like how fucked up and crazy would the animals be?
[149:39.22]They'd have like antennas coming out of their heads.
[149:41.53]They'd be- This is- look at a whale.
[149:44.19]Look at like a big blue whale.
[149:46.13]And you try to tell me that that wouldn't be insane to see that if you were from another planet.
[149:52.52]They're a big floating mass of just, like, soft tissue, and they have these huge, huge, like, muppet mouths that go like... It's... They're completely strange.
[150:06.55]They're abnormal.
[150:07.65]They're not from Earth.
[150:08.37]They're like living machines in a way.
[150:13.43]They're just giant, hulking, like, monolith machines.
[150:16.82]It's crazy.
[150:18.36]They belong in us.
[150:24.01]Why'd you cut my mic?
[150:24.97]Why?
[150:27.81]Um, that's kind of cool.
[150:28.71]Whatever that is.
[150:30.31]Porcupine's kind of cool.
[150:32.31]Prairie dogs are kind of like... Hmm, they're alright.
[150:38.49]It's kind of like another dog with horns.
[150:41.43]This is a Jerma Shepherd with horns.
[150:43.11]What is this?
[150:44.76]A pronghorn?
[150:48.24]Rabbits are pretty cool.
[150:50.56]Raccoons are really cool.
[150:53.33]Rats are us here.
[150:54.55]We'll mess with this in a little bit.
[150:56.69]This thing's kind of cool.
[150:58.39]Sea lions are kind of cool.
[151:01.51]Seals are kind of... Seals are alright.
[151:03.59]I like when they go like this.
[151:05.04]And their whole head kind of stuffs into their neck.
[151:08.84]A shrew!
[151:09.50]Oh yeah, shrew is up here.
[151:12.44]Skunks are fun.
[151:14.60]Squirrels are cool, but there's just like...
[151:16.97]It's an oversaturated market for squirrels.
[151:18.76]You know what I mean?
[151:19.70]It's not interesting to see a squirrel.
[151:21.84]Even though they're really cool and they're really funny.
[151:24.26]It's a very... It's a very oversaturated market.
[151:27.32]I think.
[151:27.54]Uh... Vols are cool.
[151:31.20]I don't know if they're S tier though.
[151:35.47]Weasels are S tier.
[151:37.75]Walrus is kind of like... I don't know.
[151:39.45]Weird to me.
[151:40.11]Wolf is... I mean, it's just like so easy.
[151:42.93]Wolverine's just so angry.
[151:44.13]It's funny.
[151:45.45]Okay.
[151:45.55]Okay.
[151:47.26]Let's get this accurate.
[151:54.36]Which one is your fursona?
[151:55.27]It's one of these in S tier.
[151:56.83]Alright, armadillo versus rat.
[152:02.89]Armadillo versus otter.
[152:04.95]Yeah, armadillo is cool.
[152:09.17]I think skunks are funnier than black bears.
[152:11.31]I don't know why.
[152:14.86]Mole, Weasel, Possum.
[152:17.05]Whale, I think, comes up high, like here.
[152:19.29]Alright.
[152:23.65]Mouse.
[152:23.95]Manatee.
[152:26.57]Chipmunk.
[152:29.14]Orca.
[152:29.66]Orca and Whale.
[152:30.48]They're just so huge and hulking.
[152:33.22]It's so interesting.
[152:36.88]Where's Wolverine?
[152:37.58]Wolverine has to come up.
[152:38.77]Yeah.
[152:46.00]Well, that's not fair.
[152:47.90]I'm basing the opinion of bringing the fox up, not because I want to be the contrarian, but because of that video of the fox going like... That's such a cute video, I love it.
[153:02.55]It's like one of the cutest videos ever.
[153:05.27]The fox is so happy, and just like, it's like... It starts just making noise, and it's so happy.
[153:15.08]Like, they're about to get a treat, and they're just like, oh my god!
[153:17.38]Yay!
[153:18.16]What?
[153:24.75]What do you mean, what?
[153:25.79]You guys have not seen that video?
[153:31.47]That video is so good.
[153:32.33]Yeah, how many of you guys have not seen that video?
[153:36.15]I'm supposed to be the one that doesn't know anything about the internet.
[153:38.50]You guys are supposed to know all this.
[153:44.91]Okay, rabbit.
[153:45.61]Yeah, I think this is good.
[153:46.39]I don't think I need to change anything.
[153:47.81]You can probably tell that I think most of the animals with horns are kind of interesting, but not really.
[153:54.39]They always do this.
[153:55.99]Okay.
[153:57.41]The horned animals are like the Ford truck commercial of the animal world.
[154:03.77]They always take the same picture of them sideways turned head.
[154:07.86]Like, looking in the camera.
[154:09.52]Like, sideways profile, head turned.
[154:16.31]I feel like it's like a car commercial.
[154:18.63]It's just a model pose, yeah.
[154:21.97]I think my drink is leaking.
[154:23.37]I just have to drink it faster.
[154:27.28]Oh, American made.
[154:30.00]Yeah, this is what I think of.
[154:31.04]This thing's going to start to leak.
[154:39.17]It's starting to kind of compress on itself.
[154:40.81]I don't know why.
[154:42.61]Alright, there you go.
[154:47.58]Animal tier list, that means my fursona is an armadillo.
[154:50.67]Or a rat, or an otter.
[154:52.53]Or a skunk.
[154:54.83]I don't want to be a skunk, though.
[154:55.83]I think I would be an armadillo.
[154:56.87]What's next?
[155:01.27]Uh... These are fast food mascots I could beat in a fight.
[155:12.90]Okay.
[155:14.78]Well, I'm going to tell you right off the bat, I'm just going to stomp this guy.
[155:19.00]You know what I mean?
[155:20.14]One shoe print is going to instantly kill and break every bone in this thing's body.
[155:26.13]This is going to be like, and it's going to be squished.
[155:32.35]So that's guaranteed.
[155:36.55]Wendy, I'm not so sure.
[155:38.58]I think I get beat up, Wendy.
[155:42.58]You might kick the shit out of me, though.
[155:50.67]I feel like I would- I might actually get my ass kicked from Wendy.
[155:56.42]I would not be prepared for what Wendy would do.
[155:59.50]Like, I feel like she would come with like a fucking pitchfork or something.
[156:08.88]Wendy's 12.
[156:17.93]Well, what would you like me to say about the baby then?
[156:21.19]What do you want me to say about the baby?
[156:25.37]What should we say about the literal infant baby on this list?
[156:31.11]Okay.
[156:41.52]This guy's going to kill me.
[156:43.22]I've already died.
[156:44.28]The Quaker Road guy's fucking going to kill me.
[156:47.51]Hawaiian Punch, I'm just going through this.
[156:49.09]Okay, the Happy Meal guy.
[156:51.16]The Happy Meal guy.
[156:52.26]I would just go like this and like fold him.
[156:56.23]And just crush him.
[157:01.03]Uh, this flight involved here, I'm, I don't like, I, I love bees, I love what they do for the environment.
[157:06.19]I, we need to protect bees at all costs.
[157:08.93]But if one bee, like, gets, like, too close to me, I'm gonna go like this.
[157:14.61]And fucking run.
[157:15.81]So, I don't know.
[157:17.87]I'm not sure if I would be able to do it.
[157:23.38]These, uh, these, these three little guys here.
[157:28.53]They could, they could like be anywhere.
[157:29.71]Aren't they like this big?
[157:31.97]They're like this big.
[157:32.83]And they, okay, not only are they small, but they have like sentience, like human sentience.
[157:39.62]They're like intelligent beings, right?
[157:42.72]They could literally just poison my drink.
[157:47.46]Yeah, they could come in with like a cyanide capsule and fucking just like heave it up there, get up there and dump it into like my coffee.
[157:54.18]I would lose absolutely.
[157:58.48]Tony the Tiger?
[157:59.10]Oh, it's not even gonna be a fight.
[158:02.92]Tony the Tiger would destroy me.
[158:11.72]Okay, this is like an old revolutionary guy, right?
[158:14.49]I feel like this guy would just shoot me.
[158:18.71]Chuck E. Cheese, that's a fair fight.
[158:22.57]Yeah.
[158:24.21]Why is a jelly bean even on this list?
[158:29.15]It would be... I would just eat him.
[158:30.35]I would just be like, oh, you want to fight?
[158:35.33]And then I'd go, oh, you were popcorn.
[158:37.55]Ugh.
[158:41.96]Wakers were pacifists.
[158:43.32]Wait, they were?
[158:44.40]Oh.
[158:48.08]I'm getting deja vu.
[158:49.00]Did we have the same conversation like three years ago?
[158:58.03]We did the same thing.
[159:01.11]We did the same thing.
[159:04.02]Did I do the same list?
[159:05.46]Why am I acting like this is so different?
[159:09.63]Mr. Peanut, easy.
[159:16.25]Grimace?
[159:16.71]This is... I don't know.
[159:17.91]Grimace... Grimace, I feel like, doesn't have very much access to his hands.
[159:21.95]So, all it would take would be, like, a full sprint dropkick right into his stomach, and he would just tumble off a cliff, and it'd be over.
[159:29.00]So, I think I would... I would think I would destroy Grimace.
[159:35.69]Mmm...
[159:49.39]I could beat.
[159:50.23]I could beat.
[159:51.09]I could absolutely beat the Lucky Charms Leprechaun.
[159:56.78]Again, we have the same problem here.
[159:59.24]The same problem here.
[160:00.24]I could just get poisoned.
[160:02.96]I could just get poisoned.
[160:04.84]Just a cyanide pill.
[160:06.26]They're like this tall, right?
[160:12.56]I would be in big trouble.
[160:14.90]Poison isn't a fight.
[160:16.55]What do you mean?
[160:21.65]Wait, it's not which one of these could, like, murder you in your sleep?
[160:25.32]It's fight.
[160:27.34]Oh.
[160:27.46]Oh, okay.
[160:35.34]Um, then, yeah.
[160:36.26]It would be pretty easy.
[160:38.06]That would be very easy.
[160:45.74]What's the point of this whole list?
[160:48.00]This is an old man.
[160:52.13]Like... Nobody on this list could stand a chance besides Tony the Tiger and maybe Chef Boyardee.
[161:05.68]Bouquet and Sam has flight, which is very important.
[161:07.60]This is just another... Another, like... This is like another little kid.
[161:14.74]What's the difference between these two?
[161:21.45]What's the difference?
[161:25.54]We already did this.
[161:26.32]I don't even need to do this again.
[161:29.11]Uh, this is a cow.
[161:30.25]So, I don't- I mean... I feel like I could get, like, really fucked up.
[161:36.41]This is a- This is a cheetah.
[161:39.41]Which I would be- Alright, what's more dangerous?
[161:41.70]A tiger or a cheetah?
[161:43.84]By the way, like, a cracked out cheetah.
[161:47.98]Tony the Tiger is, like, fit, and he wants to help, and he wants you to go and have a great time, and go out inside and play soccer, and this guy's like, Cheetos!
[161:58.64]Yeah!
[161:59.56]Like, this guy's fucked.
[162:01.54]I don't know about this guy.
[162:05.08]Junk food, motherfuckers!
[162:06.38]Like, this, yeah, this guy's an absolute, this is mayhem.
[162:09.37]I would, this is S tier for sure.
[162:19.16]Who's this?
[162:20.14]I mean, I would annihilate you.
[162:23.46]This is the Taco Bell dog.
[162:25.93]This is very important because there's a very high chance that there could be a 90s comedy scene where he, like, bites my balls.
[162:33.93]Right?
[162:34.35]And I gotta be like, oh, the dog!
[162:36.13]This could be very, very difficult.
[162:45.07]The Keebler elves, goodbye.
[162:46.65]The M&Ms, goodbye.
[162:47.67]They're just like, they're like an inch tall.
[162:51.84]Why are you on here twice?
[162:52.84]I would kill both hands.
[162:54.90]Your left and your right.
[162:59.14]Ronald McDonald, I would put up here.
[163:00.87]Yeah.
[163:02.05]Yeah.
[163:04.55]I don't know why I'm just imagining Ronald McDonald with a pissed face in like a candid TikTok video for some reason.
[163:14.34]Like just slapping me in the fucking face.
[163:18.58]Like somebody's filming it on TikTok or something.
[163:21.64]I don't know why, I'm just imagining me sitting there like, fuck you, you piece of shit.
[163:24.56]And he just goes like... And I go... Yeah, so he'd win.
[163:31.13]He would kick the shit out of me.
[163:39.09]Because this happened.
[163:52.40]The Kool-Aid Man.
[163:53.20]He's got size.
[163:56.88]But I would absolutely beat them.
[163:58.32]Because he just made it a glass.
[164:02.44]I would just pick up a rock and throw it as hard as I could.
[164:05.02]And it would just...
[164:12.37]Kool-Aid Man is also, like, cracked out.
[164:14.35]It doesn't, no.
[164:15.27]But the Kool-Aid Man's made out of glass.
[164:19.35]He's made out of bulletproof glass?
[164:21.03]Where do you, who said that?
[164:23.53]He breaks through walls.
[164:24.75]Oh, shit, he does.
[164:26.30]That's a, that's a big problem.
[164:36.24]I feel like, like, the Hawaiian punch in the stomach would probably hurt, but that would just, probably just dropkick him after that.
[164:46.55]I think I can do it.
[164:48.49]Oh, here's another, like, this is another, like, cracked out guy, you know what I mean?
[164:53.21]I don't know if he's higher than, he's up here.
[164:57.35]This is somebody that when they eat chocolate, they turn to, like, it's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
[165:03.27]So, I don't know, if I kept chocolate away from the Cocoa Puffs bird, I think I would be able to do it.
[165:08.30]But if he, like, Popeye the Sailor Man spinach, like, crushed, like, a chocolate bar in his mouth, I'm gonna run.
[165:18.48]But that's up in the air.
[165:19.18]I'm not sure.
[165:25.08]Sun?
[165:25.58]Oh, raisins.
[165:26.26]Okay.
[165:31.80]I think that'd be pretty... Mmm.
[165:44.59]Farmers are ripped.
[165:45.67]Yeah.
[165:46.49]That's why I'm sitting here thinking about this.
[165:56.71]You're out in the sun, you're doing stuff.
[166:01.04]I'm such a soft, supple, fucking blob person at this point.
[166:07.74]I would probably crumble in one fucking hit.
[166:12.30]I have like... My stomach is made out of... It's like shakes now.
[166:27.03]I would probably lose.
[166:33.32]I would probably lose.
[166:34.26]Especially if you caught me on like... You're dead.
[166:45.11]No, it would be fair.
[166:45.89]It would be a fair fight.
[166:46.85]No, it wouldn't.
[166:56.98]Your supple?
[166:57.76]Well, I mean just like my supple.
[166:59.70]I don't have words to describe.
[167:01.10]There you go.
[167:03.13]There's the list of food mascots I could beat in a fight.
[167:08.75]Tier list maker.
[167:14.19]M&Ms are human-sized.
[167:16.57]No, they're not.
[167:18.47]What are you talking about?
[167:21.49]A human-sized M&M is just grimace.
[167:25.07]That's wrong.
[167:26.15]What?
[167:26.81]No, it's not.
[167:32.46]It does exist.
[167:33.76]They do exist.
[167:35.62]They're like up to his shin.
[167:37.60]They're not even up to his knees, guys, in that Santa Claus commercial.
[167:41.84]What are you talking about?
[167:43.73]They're not human size.
[167:45.65]They're tiny.
[167:46.39]They're like two feet tall.
[167:52.70]Santa's huge.
[167:53.58]Santa's not like 15 feet tall.
[167:57.30]Hey, sorry.
[167:58.64]Santa's not as tall as a monster, okay?
[168:00.62]Santa's not as tall as a monster, alright?
[168:03.90]Come on.
[168:05.12]You guys trying to say that?
[168:08.38]Yes, he is.
[168:08.88]Santa is not fucking 30 feet tall.
[168:14.02]No, he's not.
[168:15.68]I'm gonna... How tall is... How tall is Santa?
[168:25.77]How tall is he?
[168:28.43]He's 6'6".
[168:36.75]Okay, but if you're 6'6", somebody that's... M&M's come up to his shins.
[168:43.73]We're watching that fucking commercial, and I'm gonna put this to rest.
[168:53.86]Oh yeah, they're human-sized!
[168:54.98]They're not even- they're not even to the base of the Christmas tree!
[169:08.83]This ad is not canon.
[169:11.99]Oh, please.
[169:15.43]I'm putting it on here.
[169:18.44]What do you mean not canon?
[169:26.84]You guys ready?
[169:28.82]Don't listen to that ad.
[169:49.32]This is the checkers game.
[169:53.37]Okay, you ready?
[170:00.47]Look at how pissed I look.
[170:01.91]I'm like... Alright, we're going to watch this because I want to prove once and for all that you guys are completely wrong.
[170:15.00]So, what we have here... Stop.
[170:19.02]Can you see it?
[170:19.54]No, you can't see it.
[170:23.68]Let's find out how tall the M&Ms are.
[170:36.83]So, you think Santa will like these red and green M&Ms?
[170:39.51]I don't know.
[170:40.37]I never met the guy.
[170:42.99]Okay.
[170:44.47]Explain to me how this guy that's 6'6".
[170:47.39]He's 6 feet tall.
[170:49.27]6 1⁄2 feet tall.
[170:52.51]So, if you go up one foot... These guys are like maybe 9 to 10, like 12 inches tall.
[171:03.11]He does exist!
[171:04.25]They do exist.
[171:07.88]And by the way, all it took was for them to see Santa Claus, and he fainted.
[171:12.97]I would kick the shit out of these two.
[171:17.61]Are you kidding me?
[171:18.23]Imagine meeting Jerma985.
[171:19.81]Imagine you meet me.
[171:23.37]Well, Jerma985!
[171:23.93]I rest my case.
[171:33.42]It's over.
[171:42.88]Oh my god, he does exist.
[171:45.08]I do exist.
[171:50.60]That's what I would do.
[171:51.36]I wouldn't faint.
[172:01.71]Why is it so bright in my room?
[172:02.83]I hate cameras.

[172:57.22]It's a lot.

[174:42.60]I don't understand this whole pair alcohol with shit.
[174:45.06]No.
[174:45.26]I want to drink alcohol separately.
[174:50.77]I don't get it.
[174:53.79]I don't want to drink.
[174:55.41]Give me like a Sprite.
[174:57.23]I would take a glass of milk over a red wine at dinner.
[175:01.40]I don't like drinking.
[175:02.34]I love wine.
[175:03.12]Don't get me wrong.
[175:04.16]Red wine is S tier for me.
[175:05.88]And alcohol?
[175:06.40]Oh, pair it with this meat.
[175:09.88]What the fuck are you talking about?
[175:10.92]I feel like you're just making that up.
[175:16.16]Do you feel like the people just make that up?
[175:17.92]That they just go like, oh, oh, oh, yeah, oh, and that piece of steak.
[175:22.80]Oh, yes, that, oh, that, that, that.
[175:24.96]Wow.
[175:25.34]I feel like you're just making it up to, like, seem sophisticated.
[175:31.14]I've done that before, and it's just like this.
[175:32.34]It tastes like I just drank wine after eating, like, a piece of meat.
[175:38.32]And guess what I did?
[175:40.24]Guess what I did after I did that?
[175:44.54]Oh, yeah.
[175:45.00]Oh, no, that pairs very well.
[175:47.26]You know what I want to try?
[175:48.14]I want to try that with the fish.
[175:50.02]I want to try that with the fish.
[175:51.63]It's like, what the fuck are you talking?
[175:52.59]Stop.
[175:52.81]You're making this up.
[175:55.67]I have done this at least a handful of times before.
[176:04.45]And then you're at dinner and you tell other people and you don't give a shit about any of this, but you just do because then that person thinks you know what you're talking about because you've like had that experience before where it's like, oh, you're getting the chicken?
[176:22.15]Let me tell you something.
[176:23.75]I'd recommend a Malbec.
[176:25.17]I'd recommend a Malbec.
[176:27.77]It's like, oh, wow, you... You know wine.
[176:31.25]You must... You're much more sophisticated.
[176:33.19]I thought you just ate McDonald's McChickens and ate Capri Sun juice boxes.
[176:38.21]Nope.
[176:39.17]I do more.
[176:42.28]I just don't get it.
[176:43.14]Maybe call me, like, uncultured weirdo.
[176:46.08]I want to drink wine out of the bottle.
[176:49.12]Just, like, drink it.
[176:51.52]I don't want, like, the... Here, have you want some wine at dinner?
[176:54.78]Oh, here.
[176:56.00]Here you go, sir.
[176:58.84]Okay, great.
[177:00.10]What am I supposed to do with this?
[177:03.60]What am I supposed to do with that?
[177:08.60]Thanks for the sip of wine.
[177:09.69]Oh, that'll be like, that'll be like $19, by the way.
[177:15.77]The whole meal was like fucking 20 bucks.
[177:30.45]Oh, yeah.
[177:31.59]Yeah, I could see that.
[177:32.61]I could see that with a casserole.
[177:40.89]Alright, let's backtrack a little bit.
[177:42.29]If you like, like what?
[177:43.48]No, no, I'm not backtracking on this one.
[177:49.10]Roasted vegetables are pretty good.
[177:52.82]Scalloped potatoes.
[177:53.56]Holy shit.
[177:54.24]Absolutely.
[177:55.72]Sparkling juice.
[177:57.94]Yep.
[178:00.12]That, I don't have to pretend with that one.
[178:02.74]It's just like, it's sparkling like grape juice.
[178:05.20]And I go, oh my god, this is great.
[178:07.35]I love this.
[178:09.95]I don't have to take the sparkling grape juice and go, Oh, yum.
[178:16.11]Oh, no.
[178:16.81]Just give me the fucking goddamn grape juice.
[178:18.75]I don't, you know what I mean?
[178:23.88]Sweet potato casserole.
[178:25.08]It's alright.
[178:25.76]It's good.
[178:31.27]Fuck you, you put dinner rolls at a hard pass.
[178:33.64]Well, because I... There's only enough real estate on your... Your plate to have... Dinner rolls, biscuits, they take up a lot of real estate.
[178:43.06]Because they're kind of... They're a big, like, solid shape.
[178:45.95]And they have to, like... You really want, like, more than one or two.
[178:49.15]But they kind of slide around.
[178:50.21]They take up a lot of space.
[178:53.64]I like everything separated, by the way.
[178:55.66]When I go up for Thanksgiving dinner, and, like, if I, like, somebody made it, because I don't fucking do that.
[179:01.66]I fucking don't know how to cook.
[179:03.65]I don't know how... I'm not a good... Like, if my mother were to make Thanksgiving dinner, it's not going to be me.
[179:10.25]I'm going to go separate everything.
[179:13.09]You go up more than once.
[179:14.79]The people... You're at the kids' table.
[179:16.80]No, I'm not.
[179:17.50]I'm a grown-up.
[179:18.94]But... So...
[179:22.48]You go get enough.
[179:23.86]I don't like putting everything on top of each other.
[179:25.24]You look at like, oh, I'll go Jerry over there.
[179:28.10]And he's got a plate this high and he's putting stuff on top of the biscuits and shit.
[179:33.28]It's like, just come back.
[179:34.74]Like you can come back up again.
[179:36.36]You don't have to do that.
[179:38.87]You don't, like, you don't, like, oh, here's the big turkey.
[179:41.31]Here's, like, the biscuits.
[179:42.09]Here's the cranberry sauce.
[179:43.65]Like, Uncle Jerry, you don't have to, like, put everything on the plate at the same time.
[179:48.63]I like having turkey sectioned.
[179:51.47]Stuffing sectioned.
[179:53.39]Everything has to have its own place.
[179:56.91]I don't like when everything's just mixed together and mashed together.
[179:59.37]No, I like it in its own place.
[180:04.17]It gets too messy.
[180:05.94]Things start to blend into each other.
[180:11.43]I would definitely say that... I'm going to put this at great.
[180:21.04]Scalloped potatoes I'd rather have than... That's not accurate.
[180:27.32]You put pie in hard pass.
[180:29.84]Banana cream pie is the only pie I like.
[180:33.46]Chocolate cream and banana cream pie are the only two pies that I like to eat.
[180:37.12]I don't like any other pie.
[180:39.65]I'm sorry that everyone doesn't like that.
[180:41.71]Let me put some lip balm on.
[180:46.26]I just realized my eyes have been open for a long time.
[180:51.40]The pie opinion is wrong?
[180:52.42]I just don't really like pie.
[180:57.06]I don't like hot pies.
[180:58.48]Like warm pies.
[180:59.30]I'm starting to realize this.
[181:01.26]I know the pumpkin pie isn't necessarily warm, but
[181:08.96]Turn on the music?
[181:09.60]What happened?
[181:09.96]Did we lose it?
[181:13.96]What about with ice cream?
[181:14.86]No.
[181:16.74]Nope.
[181:17.48]Because the ice cream just like melts and turns into liquid.
[181:19.84]And then it's like you... It's weird to scoop it up.
[181:21.96]I don't like it.
[181:24.38]Um... What happened to the Delta Ruin soundtrack?
[181:35.07]Okay, here we go.
[181:41.39]Okay.
[181:44.69]Hard pass on ham?
[181:45.65]Yeah, to me, Thanksgiving's turkey.
[181:48.25]I'd rather not have ham.
[181:50.13]I'm actually not really a ham guy, if I'm honest, too.
[181:57.25]Crusty lips?
[181:57.95]I know, that's why I have to continuously lubricate them.
[182:01.11]I'm aware.
[182:04.09]I think this is good.
[182:06.25]This is good.
[182:09.65]What's up next?
[182:12.50]This one is a create a Christmas movies tier list.
[182:20.69]I'm not even sure I've seen half of these.
[182:28.96]Um, we'll find out.
[182:33.65]I remember this movie, because there's a scene in this movie at the end where Bill Murray is trying to rile up a crowd.
[182:43.09]And he's like, yeah, let's hear everybody start screaming.
[182:46.54]Alright, just the parents.
[182:49.42]Oh, just the men.
[182:51.68]Oh, just the children.
[182:53.54]Oh, and then he goes, and you, you that's been talking through the whole movie.
[182:58.54]And I freaked out.
[182:59.54]I thought he was talking to me.
[183:04.30]I thought he was talking to me.
[183:05.68]I was terrified.
[183:06.24]I was like, I was talking through the whole movie.
[183:10.78]He knows.
[183:12.16]Skip what?
[183:12.60]Skip?
[183:16.24]What do you mean skip?
[183:17.70]It's November.
[183:25.21]Alright, can I just find where my favorite Christmas movie is?
[183:27.79]There it is.
[183:31.95]These one and two
[183:33.86]Or up here.
[183:34.60]And this one.
[183:35.72]Alright.
[183:36.40]Can I- I- I- I- I- This is not gonna take me very long.
[183:45.88]Everything else doesn't even need- I don't even need to put anything else up here.
[184:00.95]Yeah, I'm done.
[184:01.43]I did-
[184:03.86]Oh, wait, this one, yeah.
[184:07.40]Uh... Where's the... Where's the claymation, Rudolph?
[184:19.55]Where's the Frosty the Snowman?
[184:21.14]The claymation, is it on here?
[184:25.24]Oh, there it is.
[184:31.07]Yeah, this is absolutely legendary.
[184:33.81]What about Die Hard?
[184:34.80]I'm not going to watch... Die Hard's not... I'm not going to watch... Oh, my God.
[184:38.30]I didn't even see it.
[184:41.22]Ernest saves Christmas.
[184:42.40]Mm-hmm.
[184:49.03]Okay.
[184:57.15]I've never seen any of the Die Hard movies.
[184:58.87]None of them.
[185:00.93]Never.
[185:01.15]Never seen Elf.
[185:07.04]I don't know why, but like... These... These are all... These are all Tim Allen to me.
[185:31.60]I don't know why it's all Tim Allen.
[185:35.61]Every single time that I see, like, Santa, it's Tim Allen.
[185:40.09]But it's not.
[185:40.83]But why is that happening?
[185:43.97]Is this Tim Allen?
[185:49.28]I don't know.
[186:01.66]Jingle all the way is Arnold, yeah.
[186:03.96]And by the way, that's a great one.
[186:10.09]But like, are these all Tim Allen?
[186:12.67]I feel like there was a point in Tim Allen's career where he just was Santa Claus for like 10 years straight.
[186:16.61]Put that cookie down.
[186:25.04]Now.
[186:28.93]The list is over.
[186:29.77]Okay, we'll move on.
[186:32.29]This is create a Kevin MacLeod royalty-free songs tier list.

[188:49.26]Okay, I would put this one at S, but unfortunately it's been in like 40% of every mobile game I've ever played.
[188:56.56]So it's got to come down a little bit.

[191:18.68]Hmm.
[191:28.17]It's alright.
[191:32.07]It's okay.
[191:35.73]Yeah, it's alright.
[191:37.93]I guess it could be used for some kind of action sequence, right?
[191:44.33]This one's called Jaunty Gumption.
[191:54.78]This is Gloom Man's fucking original entrance music.
[191:58.51]Yep, there's the... Penis music?
[192:01.05]Kind of.
[192:22.51]Yeah, that's probably the best one so far.
[192:23.91]Alright, local forecast.
[192:26.23]How about that one?
[192:42.44]Oh, this is in so many things, too.
[192:44.12]This is in so many games and, like, ads.
[192:46.89]Oh, I just, like...
[192:53.91]I keep seeing it.
[192:55.37]No, I can't put it in an S. I've heard too many things that traumatized me.
[192:59.76]I'll put it in an A. Okay, this one's called Look Busy.
[193:31.88]This is a classic, but I don't know if it should be up all the way at S. It's good, it's good, but I put it above this, I think.
[193:51.96]Yeah.
[193:56.24]Okay, Meatball Parade.
[194:05.44]I feel like I know this one.
[194:07.32]Oh, yeah, it's... Without a doubt.
[194:20.01]This is the cartoon music I played when I streamed Overwatch back in like 2016.
[194:23.45]Yep.
[194:35.46]Okay.
[194:36.22]That's brap music.
[194:37.18]I don't even know what that means.
[194:39.62]Alright, uh, merry-go.
[194:47.95]Merry-go.
[194:51.40]Mm-mm-mm.
[194:54.46]Mm-mm.
[195:11.89]No, I hate this one.
[195:12.86]I hate this one It's not because the music's bad because I've just seen it and heard it so many times and play it just I don't like it Monkeys spinning monkeys Oh God
[195:34.85]I can recite this one by heart, so it has to be up here.
[196:03.54]Alright, Pixel Peeker Polka.
[196:26.20]It's good, but... It can't beat the classics for me.
[196:42.85]Yep, I think it belongs there.
[196:44.75]This Run Amok, I feel like this is the ultimate YouTuber one, right?
[196:49.57]I think this is the ultimate YouTuber song, isn't it?
[197:04.50]Find out.
[197:10.40]Oh, no, no, this is it.
[197:11.80]This is the... Wait, this is Glue Man.
[197:14.40]This is Glue Man.
[197:17.14]Wait, no, this is... Okay, this is Glue Man 2.
[197:26.01]Yeah.
[197:26.81]This is Glue Man's second entrance music.
[197:31.07]I actually like this one better.
[197:36.80]Dun-dun.
[197:38.34]Dun-dun.
[197:48.90]I don't like that part.
[197:52.16]That's the only part I don't like.
[197:55.16]Alright, uh, Scheming Weasel.
[198:23.47]does this take over fluffing a duck I think this is I think this is like a better version of fluffing a duck I think we have to change that yep okay sneaky adventure
[198:50.40]This is in the archaeology stream.
[199:09.11]Right?
[199:09.67]Or was it?
[199:10.01]Is this in Kerbal Space Program?
[199:19.09]Dude, look at this fucking thing.
[199:20.33]Ready?
[199:21.23]Look at this.
[199:23.43]Do you see the bottom of this cup?
[199:26.71]It's like starting to get like so wet down here that it's like losing its... It's gonna come out.
[199:37.72]The bottom's gonna fall out of this thing.
[199:43.81]Yeah, look at this.
[199:49.72]It should not be doing this.
[199:54.66]Drink it faster.
[199:55.76]I'm slowing down.
[199:58.46]It's alright.
[200:00.12]We already know what sneaky snitch sounds like.
[200:05.95]But let's just put it up there.
[200:07.75]It's going to be lower than I think a lot of you guys think.
[200:20.89]I don't like it.
[200:23.03]I used this song in Otto's dog farts messing up my game and I hate it ever since What a bad video Jesus Christ Okay, like I thought to record
[200:45.37]Put music on that, render it, upload it, and publish it.
[200:49.27]I don't know why.
[200:53.70]Why?
[200:55.24]You know what it was?
[200:57.06]That was, oh my god, it's been like three days without a video.
[201:00.42]I don't have anything ready.
[201:02.66]I need to do something.
[201:05.06]Sometimes that would happen.
[201:07.60]Yeah, that's the YouTuber panic mode where it's been four days.
[201:13.20]I have to upload something.
[201:16.21]That really only happened, like, maybe 10 times total.
[201:23.35]And then after, like... After, like, 2013, 2014, I did not really give a shit about that anymore.
[201:32.67]And it was Smite gameplay.
[201:33.85]Yeah.
[201:34.35]Watch that.
[201:34.93]Watch it.
[201:35.33]Delete it on stream.
[201:40.47]Like...
[201:53.04]I don't want to watch this video.
[202:00.24]This is two minutes.
[202:05.08]I'm only going to stomach this video for like 30 seconds, I think.
[202:10.93]If you want to eat healthy and feel your best.
[202:13.37]That's not my video.
[202:23.38]Alright, I'm willing to give this 30 seconds.
[202:36.09]Here comes the music.
[202:41.24]An ally has been... Oh my god.
[202:44.46]Oh, my dog just farted.
[202:45.58]I farted!
[202:47.02]Oh, this sucks.
[202:48.24]It's horrible, dude.
[202:48.96]I can't even... You're shitting me right now.
[202:52.04]I can't even, like, play the game.
[202:55.63]Be careful, they're right here.
[202:57.11]I can't even... I can't get... Smite's one of those games where you can't leave.
[202:59.79]I can't leave right now.
[203:00.51]I have to, like, accept this for what happened.
[203:04.59]It's not like I can just get up and, like, walk away right now.
[203:08.86]Seriously?
[203:10.12]Man, this is horrendous.
[203:13.33]It's the whole video.
[203:14.25]Oh, God.
[203:14.99]Hold on.
[203:16.49]No, I'm serious, Ryan.
[203:17.51]Hold on a second.
[203:18.73]I'm freaking sorry.
[203:21.41]Oh, my God.
[203:22.95]What happened to your voice?
[203:23.75]I aged 10 years.
[203:24.97]Here I come.
[203:25.51]Oh, you guys don't even need my help, do you?
[203:31.44]My ult didn't even go off.
[203:32.54]I got him.
[203:34.50]No, I'm sorry.
[203:35.74]Seriously, alright.
[203:37.43]Alright, go on.
[203:39.89]Shoo.
[203:41.61]Dude, can you imagine if I just like, if you guys both died right there?
[203:45.31]What?
[203:46.77]Yeah, that was weird.
[203:49.95]I saw that.
[203:51.10]No, that was miles away.
[203:52.48]Boston wore off with age.
[203:53.74]Yeah, it did.
[203:54.94]What?
[203:56.56]Especially since moving too, like three years ago.
[203:59.70]I was losing it a little bit, but then it's almost... It still pops up now and then.
[204:03.69]No!
[204:03.89]No!
[204:04.13]I just saw him.
[204:07.85]Fucking dog.
[204:18.48]Blame the dog for your bad... Your dog didn't fart in my face.
[204:24.09]That would not have happened.
[204:25.17]He didn't poop.
[204:26.87]No, he didn't.
[204:27.39]He's right here.
[204:29.67]Have you checked the floor?
[204:31.57]No, there's no... That completely threw my game off.
[204:38.20]We were doing like... Actually, we killed him, but... I was doing well, and then the dog farted in my face, and it was just over.
[204:47.08]That's the entire video.
[204:49.95]Is it?
[204:50.33]Say, did you like that video?
[204:51.51]Make sure you, like, like the video if you did.
[204:53.23]Oh, I lost.
[204:57.42]Oh, what the fuck, dog?
[204:58.60]I can't believe you did that.
[204:59.90]Please, God, upload a video.
[205:02.08]It's funny.
[205:02.50]It's funny enough.
[205:03.68]It can go up.
[205:13.69]What a terrible video.
[205:18.36]Apologize to Otto.
[205:26.69]Did he actually fart?
[205:27.89]What, you think I made it up?
[205:30.09]I made that whole thing up for, like, the video?
[205:33.55]No.
[205:36.13]That would have been so stupid.
[205:40.17]That was, yeah, it's called Uncensored.
[205:49.26]Back when swearing, I was concerned about.
[205:56.42]Jesus Christ.
[205:58.74]I didn't pretend, it really happened, it did.
[206:00.44]And what happened to your voice?
[206:04.06]Well, I have a new, it's an old mic from like almost 10 years ago.
[206:10.75]And I've aged 10 years.
[206:18.48]Wow, that guy is so funny.
[206:20.58]Where did you find this guy?
[206:22.06]What?
[206:25.76]Not even watching VODs from last year, you sound different.
[206:30.14]I also got like an XL, a GoXLR too.
[206:32.76]I remember when I changed over to the GoXLR, everyone was like, what the fuck happened to your voice?
[206:36.84]That was like a year and a half ago, two years ago.
[206:39.10]Yeah.
[206:40.66]I changed like my setup.
[206:43.98]I had a different mic and everything, so.
[206:46.62]I miss the old Jerma's voice.
[206:48.24]Well, it's never coming back because apparently I've got like all kinds of sinus and throat weird issues on top of my other medical problems.
[206:54.85]I'm just, I'm getting old.
[206:55.89]I'm going to start talking like this.
[206:57.97]Once I start talking like this, that's how you know that things are, I'm getting a little older.
[207:01.28]I'm going to, this is exactly how I'm going to sound by the time I'm like 55, I think.
[207:06.64]So I'm just, it's just going there.
[207:08.16]Alright, we'll get a wallpaper.
[207:12.06]Let's watch that one.
[207:21.35]wallpaper okay let's see let's do it I don't remember this one what is this one yep this one's in every mobile game as well f I don't think it's f it's just not that high
[207:53.54]Okay, how about, there it is.
[207:59.91]What keeps happening to the Deltarune soundtrack?
[208:03.65]I just keep deleting it.
[208:04.49]I was wondering, I was like, where is it?
[208:30.98]Okay, yeah.
[208:32.48]That's not porn music.
[208:33.73]Ooh, likes to party.
[208:37.74]To wrap it up.
[208:38.30]Let's see.
[208:48.42]This is climbing.
[208:56.99]Falling back.
[208:58.85]It's losing traction.
[209:01.15]Wait, I like that little organ.
[209:08.91]There you are.
[209:09.73]There's your Kevin, your Kevin MacLeod tier list for royalty-free songs.
[209:22.01]There it is.
[209:28.27]Collapse.
[209:28.99]A loss of collapse, yeah.
[209:31.45]Okay.
[209:32.54]Now...
[209:35.06]Difficult games tier list.
[209:40.09]Either... I have to rate these by impossible to like angry to... This is going to be hard.
[209:47.01]Some of these I haven't played.
[209:47.79]Alright.
[209:51.76]Lord of the Rings.
[209:52.66]Fuck this game.
[209:54.58]I would say... Not that I can't beat it.
[209:57.78]But, it was just stupid.
[209:59.22]Okay, that's going all the way up here.
[210:01.44]Cuphead was... I got angry, but I was able to do it.
[210:04.68]Jump King was unbearable as well.
[210:09.66]And everyone wanted me to do the DLC, and I was like, I refuse.
[210:12.66]I absolutely refuse to do the DLC.
[210:14.20]I won't be able to get through it.
[210:16.32]Uh, Ikaruga.
[210:18.66]I... I don't remember.
[210:22.90]I think I played this for like... An hour.
[210:25.50]An hour.
[210:29.52]I don't remember.
[210:30.10]I cheated.
[210:37.01]Yeah, but can't... Okay.
[210:38.69]Can't beat it to me as... I beat all these games.
[210:42.61]But... Should this be... Okay, so this should be on the list of things I actually just did not play.
[210:49.37]You played Ikaruga as a joke.
[210:50.78]Yeah, alright.
[210:51.24]So, let's put it down here.
[210:53.74]What is this?
[210:56.88]What game is that?
[210:57.50]I can't tell.
[210:58.46]What is that?
[211:01.92]What is it?
[211:06.24]Is it Monster Hunter?
[211:10.41]I don't think... Monster Hunter is kind of hard, but it's... I thought it was fine.
[211:14.81]I thought there was some annoyance.
[211:20.15]What is this?
[211:22.88]I can't tell what that is.
[211:27.14]Oh, it's a different Monster Hunter.
[211:28.32]Okay, well, I haven't played it.
[211:29.32]What's this one?
[211:35.67]I don't think I've ever played this one either.
[211:39.04]That's... What is it?
[211:41.56]Mushi... Oh, I haven't played it.
[211:45.14]Salt and Sanctuary was hard, but that wasn't that bad.
[211:49.16]There was some annoyance there.
[211:53.03]I don't think I've played this either.
[211:54.29]I don't know what that is.
[212:01.17]What is this one?
[212:02.63]There's all these Monster Hunter.
[212:03.67]Monster Hunter 2?
[212:04.70]No.
[212:05.92]Dwarf Fortress?
[212:06.90]Never played it.
[212:09.32]Spelunky?
[212:10.80]I didn't really like it.
[212:13.14]I wasn't into it.
[212:16.42]Should I put it at can't beat it?
[212:17.49]But I played it, but I just didn't like it.
[212:19.27]So I'm going to put that down here.
[212:22.41]Battle...
[212:24.74]Gariga?
[212:26.28]I don't know what that is.
[212:27.68]Overwhelm?
[212:28.34]I don't know what that is.
[212:30.22]Ninja Gaiden.
[212:32.01]Ninja Gaiden... Ninja Gaiden Black.
[212:33.85]I don't think I've ever played this.
[212:37.85]I never played this one.
[212:39.39]Binding of Isaac is... It depends on your run, I think.
[212:44.94]Oh, I've- everyone's- okay.
[212:46.90]I was completely ignoring everybody saying Deltarune, because I was- I thought you said it was- you were saying it was on this list.
[212:53.61]And I was like, they just say it's not on this list.
[212:55.19]Why are they saying it's a hard game?
[212:56.29]It's like- people are like, Deltarune, Deltarune, Deltarune.
[213:00.32]It's like, it's not even on here.
[213:01.26]Why are people saying that?
[213:02.54]And then I realized what was going on.
[213:14.87]Okay.
[213:23.20]I have not played FTL.
[213:24.26]I have not played Into the Breach.
[213:27.54]I have not played Battletech.
[213:28.98]I have not.
[213:30.04]I've played Enter the Gungeon for a little bit.
[213:32.42]But I didn't really play it.
[213:33.18]I didn't really care too much.
[213:34.98]Hotline Miami.
[213:35.78]This game is fucking unbelievably unbearable.
[213:38.31]Although the second one is way worse.
[213:39.79]This one is still up here.
[213:40.63]The Witness?
[213:42.47]The Witness?
[213:47.16]I didn't play.
[213:47.62]That's just like the line puzzle game, right?
[213:49.14]I didn't play it.
[213:54.85]Mario the Lost levels, they're pretty bad.
[213:57.97]But not really.
[213:59.29]Hades was challenging, but it was still doable.
[214:04.87]Hades is probably... No, Cuphead's probably more annoying.
[214:10.49]Bloodborne is up here too, but I don't think it was... I wouldn't say Bloodborne is...
[214:17.72]It's up there pretty high.
[214:19.38]Some of those bosses were horrible.
[214:21.00]This is literally an uncompletable video game.
[214:23.36]You cannot beat this without cheats.
[214:27.17]It's not possible to beat this without a game genie.
[214:30.01]Would it be louder?
[214:34.65]I'll give you 10% louder.
[214:38.76]What else we got?
[214:39.34]Stuntman?
[214:40.04]Why is this on here?
[214:41.02]Did you make this list specifically for me?
[214:46.62]If this... Wait, why is Stuntman Ignition on here?
[214:55.13]I was like pissed at this game, but this is not considered a hard game.
[214:58.97]Is it?
[214:59.21]Is it?
[215:04.33]I don't know.
[215:06.50]What an egomaniac.
[215:08.64]Alright.
[215:10.08]What is this?
[215:11.22]Drifter?
[215:11.72]Never played it.
[215:13.46]I think Celeste was Balanced.
[215:18.76]I don't think I got too annoyed with Celeste.
[215:21.09]Noida, on the other hand, I just can't fucking do it.
[215:24.39]I cannot fucking do it.
[215:26.67]Super Meat Boy, it was bad, but it was possible.
[215:29.57]I don't think it was that high up, though.
[215:33.13]Original Castlevania was annoying, but who's going to play that right now?
[215:41.52]Like, um, it's like, oh, okay.
[215:42.84]Like, Castlevania, the original one.
[215:44.28]Like, yeah, it's... It was hard back then, but can it compare to, like, Jump King?
[215:50.91]It's, like, kind of two different... Eh.
[215:52.01]I don't know what this is.
[215:55.31]I didn't play it.
[215:57.03]The original Dark Souls... What's harder?
[216:03.47]Bloodborne or Dark Souls?
[216:05.11]I feel like they're hard for different reasons.
[216:10.58]The original Dark Souls is probably more annoying.
[216:13.94]Yeah.
[216:18.65]Super Meat Boy is not really hard, it just takes memorization.
[216:21.65]Like, you just have to memorize levels.
[216:24.84]Which you could say the same thing about Dark Souls bosses, but not really.
[216:28.17]Because Dark Souls bosses, unlike Super Meat Boy, they have a range of attacks that they will do, but you don't know which attack they're going to do.
[216:38.12]In Super Meat Boy, you know the levels are just the same, you just have to memorize the level.
[216:43.13]So.
[216:50.42]That's probably a good spot.
[216:52.94]Isaac, eh.
[216:55.37]Isaac can be really annoying sometimes, but... Demon's Souls was probably harder than... Just like the world tendency shit made this game so fucking hard sometimes.
[217:11.42]Hard or frustrating?
[217:20.33]I feel like the first few worlds, like the first two or three worlds in Demon's Souls were not that hard.
[217:29.83]It's still annoying.
[217:33.09]Desert bus?
[217:35.37]I mean, why even?
[217:36.13]There's no reason to do that.
[217:37.73]I have not played any of the Devil May Cry games.
[217:39.87]I, um... I got through some of Hollow Knight on stream.
[217:43.96]But people are mad that I never went back to it, but just the way it is.
[217:47.56]Surge, um...
[217:55.37]We have a lot of new viewers.
[218:00.97]I said a lot of mean things about The Surge.
[218:05.79]I remember streaming The Surge to like 600 viewers or something.
[218:10.08]I had like 500 viewers at the time, but like less than a thousand at the time, right?
[218:12.88]That was the very beginning of my Twitch life.
[218:18.08]Holy fuck, I hated that whole thing.
[218:21.16]I was infuriated by that whole experience.
[218:26.04]You said it was literally the worst video game ever made.
[218:28.77]It's a good game, you're just a literal baby.
[218:37.19]Does anybody have like a clip from that stream?
[218:48.61]Any of you guys, some of you like lore masters that have like a saved clip of me being like a psycho on that stream?
[218:58.77]I'm sure somebody does.
[219:04.48]Okay.
[219:05.30]Well, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna put it down here because I played it for like maybe an hour and a half.
[219:14.44]Just watch the VOD.
[219:16.58]Okay, hold on.
[219:22.37]I'm gonna... Let's see.
[219:26.97]Let's get it.
[219:29.47]It's definitely on the archive.
[219:30.51]The Surge.
[219:37.66]Yeah, okay, this is from like five years ago?
[219:40.56]Oh boy, oh boy, okay.
[219:43.86]You guys ready to see what my thought, where should I put the Surge on this tier list?
[219:53.37]We're gonna skip through, we're not gonna watch the whole thing.
[220:01.72]Okay.
[220:05.19]How long did I stream this for?
[220:09.21]I wonder.
[220:16.89]We'll find out.
[220:19.37]So this is the Surge.
[220:23.38]An hour and 55 minutes?
[220:25.20]Holy shit.
[220:27.61]And the first 10 to 20 minutes is absolutely me, like, introduction.
[220:31.28]And the last probably 40 minutes is doing the old bit readings, right?
[220:34.50]I played this for probably an hour.
[220:46.49]How excited do I sound, do you think?
[220:50.68]Boo-hoo.
[220:51.22]Boo-fucking-hoo.
[220:51.90]Cry.
[220:53.16]Crying.
[220:54.10]Tears are streaming down my face.
[220:55.86]Angry.
[220:56.48]What the fuck is going on?
[221:04.15]Yeah.
[221:07.57]Oh, wait.
[221:07.89]This is one of those plant the trees.
[221:09.51]What is going on?
[221:10.13]What is making that clicking sound?
[221:21.95]This is when they turned me into Darth Vader.
[221:23.37]I was just gonna say that!
[221:24.26]I was just gonna say that!
[221:25.94]I was just gonna say that!
[221:27.76]Cool.
[221:38.46]This is where I practice punching things, right?
[221:40.12]Alright, here we go.
[221:42.30]How much do I hate it?
[221:47.39]Press circle to heal.
[221:49.29]Use your vital injection.
[221:52.51]That's quick.
[221:53.77]R3 is lock on.
[221:54.76]Sure.
[221:56.04]R1 is horizontal.
[221:57.00]R2 is vertical.
[222:01.80]Okay.
[222:02.26]Can they be strung together?
[222:03.04]Okay.
[222:06.12]Whoever made this game, fuck you.
[222:12.75]Oh, shit.
[222:14.47]Oh, shit.
[222:19.91]Um, I don't actually I don't actually mean that by the way, I was just like frustrated at the game Who made this game fuck you Dark Souls is way better.
[222:33.57]Oh my god.
[222:34.19]I'm such a dick.
[222:35.51]What the hell?
[222:36.65]What's wrong?
[222:37.49]No, I'm this is not who I am.
[222:41.01]I
[222:48.06]Delete this!
[222:48.72]Delete this from... Delete it!
[222:54.53]Is he writing this right now?
[222:56.37]Moronic in a game like this.
[222:57.91]Fucking stuff.
[223:02.57]Why is there time-based retrieval?
[223:04.27]That's fucking moronic in a game like this.
[223:11.20]Alright.
[223:15.56]I ain't thrown in the towel yet.
[223:18.38]Not yet, not yet, not yet.
[223:19.70]Toxic.
[223:28.21]How much does this block?
[223:29.66]Okay.
[223:32.18]I gotta be very, very real with everybody here.
[223:34.78]So...
[223:36.87]There's been a lot of times I've played a game, and on stream, I never, you never want to, like, just, like, talk shit about, like, a game company, because you don't know, right?
[223:45.36]Like, just a game might not be for you, or, like, maybe it's, like, it's better later, or maybe you just, like, have to learn, like, it's a learning curve.
[223:54.94]I always hate talking shit on stream because I try to condense my rage to not get that far.
[224:05.41]So when you hear me do that, when you ever hear me do that on this broadcast, I have been holding it in and I just have to fucking say something.
[224:15.97]I've hit the boiling point at that point.
[224:20.36]And sometimes it happens really quickly, and sometimes it happens over an hour.
[224:23.72]But I always try to, like, bottle it, because I don't want to, like, obviously be, like, a dick or anything.
[224:27.56]But, like, holy shit, listen to this guy.
[224:29.75]This stream looks like ass, too, by the way.
[224:39.09]Was I streaming at, like, 480p?
[224:41.16]What, four years ago?
[224:41.96]Five years ago?
[224:42.48]Come here, you motherfucker.
[224:47.81]Was it 720?
[224:48.71]It was probably 720.
[224:49.77]No.
[224:54.82]It's probably a low bitrate, though.
[224:59.16]My bitrate that I'm doing has probably doubled since, like, 2015, 2016.
[225:02.24]Alright.
[225:11.29]And... Wait, this guy might kill me.
[225:14.33]Oh, I got hit.
[225:15.43]Immediate anger.
[225:17.99]Oh, I got hit.
[225:18.53]Apparently, I didn't have invincibility.
[225:20.51]Apparently.
[225:21.23]Apparently.
[225:22.52]Apparently.
[225:23.36]And he's gonna go... Okay.
[225:27.34]See, apparently means it's not my fault that I got hit because, like, apparently you get hit if you do that.
[225:32.34]Like, I'm... It's not my fault, right?
[225:41.09]It's this clip here.
[225:42.03]Well, I mean, where is that in the timestamp of the stream?
[225:46.82]I need a new weapon.
[225:48.02]Or something.
[225:48.82]I'm literally in the stream right now.
[225:52.64]No!
[225:52.72]Oh.
[225:52.78]This game's awful.
[226:00.70]This game is fucking terrible.
[226:03.93]I give it a zero out of fucking ten.
[226:05.29]This game's awful.
[226:07.07]Oh my god.
[226:08.25]Don't fucking buy this game.
[226:09.71]Oh my god!
[226:10.13]You want a Dark Souls game?
[226:11.03]Go play Dark Souls.
[226:11.83]This game sucks, asshole.
[226:14.77]I can't.
[226:15.43]This is awful.
[226:17.32]This is awful!
[226:17.90]I would rather you... I would rather you... No, I'm not even going to say it, because that's like lewd and fucked up.
[226:23.56]What?
[226:25.46]I was about to say something like fucked up right there.
[226:32.90]So glad I didn't watch the rest of it.
[226:40.55]Say it, say it!
[226:41.87]What if I don't say it?
[226:42.71]I don't know what he's going to say.
[226:43.65]This game's just fucking bad.
[226:50.68]How did this game get an 8?
[226:53.26]Who gave this game an 8?
[226:54.46]No.
[226:55.06]Don't.
[226:55.46]Don't.
[226:55.72]This is a fucking 6 game at best.
[226:58.42]Maybe a 5.
[227:03.08]It's probably fine.
[227:04.66]I'm just such a fucking overdramatic asshole.
[227:11.76]What the fuck is even happening with this guy?
[227:20.63]I don't know.
[227:23.30]I'm speechless.
[227:24.80]I'm just speechless.
[227:28.10]We want all Jerma?
[227:29.50]No.
[227:29.94]I literally said fuck Capcom like six weeks ago.
[227:36.65]What are you talking about?
[227:37.53]He never left.
[227:54.48]It's under.
[227:55.04]It's try harder.
[227:56.78]Oh, I'm almost there.
[228:00.58]No, I don't want to hear it.
[228:02.79]I don't want to hear it.
[228:06.09]What if I don't want to hear it, though?
[228:07.09]I don't want to hear it.
[228:07.85]I fucking hate this game.
[228:10.29]I hate this game.
[228:12.53]Honestly, this is the first game of 2017 that I fucking despise.
[228:16.18]I hate this game.
[228:19.94]I fucking hate this game.
[228:23.22]This must have been so miserable to watch live.
[228:24.98]This is the first game of 2017.
[228:26.66]That I fucking hate.
[228:28.28]Oh, listen to that.
[228:29.10]Fuck.
[228:30.12]That's not like, oh, I fucking hate this.
[228:31.83]That's I fucking, I fucking hate this.
[228:35.23]Wow.
[228:38.03]If you want to add a list, make a list.
[228:39.39]This is the first one.
[228:48.06]No, actually, I didn't... Outlast 2 was like... I wasn't a huge fan of it, but it was, you know, it was alright.
[228:54.18]I didn't mind it.
[228:54.68]It was okay.
[228:57.60]Outlast 2 was like... It wasn't really like... It didn't feel like... I said a lot of swears and stuff, but like, you know, whatever.
[229:03.68]What?
[229:04.64]What are you talking about?
[229:06.74]What are you talking about?
[229:07.96]I actually hate this game.
[229:14.16]I didn't say any swears.
[229:14.86]Outlast 2 was funny in some places.
[229:16.58]It was like fun.
[229:18.88]Well, I don't think it was as good as the first game, but I enjoyed it.
[229:22.61]Okay, so where do I say this thing?
[229:24.43]I recommend it.
[229:24.95]Didn't I give it the stamp of recommended if you like those games, right?
[229:31.27]For me, at least this year, this is the first true game sucks.
[229:34.72]Like, for me.
[229:36.80]This was the first year that I watched The Scream?
[229:38.38]You are more than welcome to enjoy this game.
[229:40.90]It's $1.53?
[229:41.38]I hope you bought it.
[229:42.60]I hope you love it.
[229:43.18]That was the Asylum Demon.

[231:32.31]I'm done.
[231:32.79]Game, I'm done playing.
[231:35.62]This is a fun game.
[231:38.14]Etalyx, where are you?
[231:43.20]Etalyx, where are you?
[231:44.85]Are you here?
[231:54.29]I tried to warn you, I played for an hour and refunded attacks.
[231:56.75]Where are you?
[231:59.21]He beat the Surge on stream.
[232:02.71]Just watch the clip.
[232:03.65]Oh, hold on.
[232:08.09]Why are you referencing Bible verses?
[232:09.73]What are you talking about?
[232:11.28]Fuck this game.
[232:11.90]I don't even care if I won.
[232:13.28]I feel, like, good about winning.
[232:14.40]No, I don't.
[232:14.94]I don't.
[232:15.16]That was, like, the tutorial boss.
[232:16.18]That was the Asylum Demon.
[232:17.64]I don't care.
[232:18.16]This game doesn't suck.
[232:21.12]I'm sorry for saying that.
[232:22.24]If you're, like, a developer and you're watching this game...
[232:26.81]Try fucking harder next time.
[232:34.13]Oh my God.
[232:37.47]Oh my God.
[232:40.60]Okay.
[232:45.98]So, uh, I'm going to say that it should probably, uh, on the, on the tier list of the surge.
[232:57.47]Should probably be on a game that I couldn't beat.
[232:59.79]I can't beat.
[233:03.20]Phew.
[233:06.10]Whew.
[233:06.50]Okay, you know what?
[233:14.83]You know what?
[233:15.17]Okay.
[233:15.31]Like...
[233:29.64]I have to get out of here.
[233:31.06]I have to get out of here.
[233:31.70]I'm not allowed on here.
[233:32.50]Alright, uh, this is F-Zero.
[233:36.24]I never played F-Zero.
[233:39.94]Oh, I did, I hated Nioh as well, didn't I?
[233:43.57]I, didn't I talk a bunch of shit about this game too?
[233:49.09]No!
[233:55.60]I remember being like, this fucking game, like, fucking sucks.
[233:57.92]No, no.
[233:59.32]I couldn't do it.
[234:07.51]No, to be fair, I was like shit-faced when I played this game, wasn't I?
[234:11.03]No.
[234:17.03]No.
[234:17.75]We're moving on.
[234:20.68]What is this one?
[234:26.06]I remember people saying, hey, you should go play Nioh 2.
[234:31.52]I don't think so.
[234:34.30]I don't think that's going to happen.
[234:39.24]No, I've not seen it.
[234:41.50]No, I've not seen it.
[234:42.64]I'm not looking at it.
[234:43.28]I gotta go pee.
[234:48.04]I'm peeing.
[234:48.74]I'm not even here.
[234:49.34]I'm leaving.
[234:55.79]I gotta pee.

[240:10.85]I kept... Oh, no.
[240:13.25]Don't clip me another one.
[240:26.36]I did it again.
[240:28.62]I talk about how much this game sucks and how it's fucking terrible.
[240:45.51]Jesus.
[240:46.49]Is it in this clip?
[241:01.68]I just think when I play hard games, I just get really, really mad.
[241:06.82]Things just piss me off.
[241:07.56]I don't know why.
[241:09.32]I just get so infuriated.
[241:13.20]That has requested this game a million times.
[241:17.50]Snoozen, are you here?
[241:18.16]That's the only reason why I'm doing this.
[241:20.94]It's like I'm playing a fighting game in the arcade.
[241:28.25]Stinger.
[241:30.07]What is that?
[241:30.53]What button is that supposed to be?
[241:34.26]Pretty good DDT.
[241:36.32]He's not here.
[241:44.30]he's not even here he's gonna shit his pants when he realizes he missed this stream but I hope the guy is here that has requested this game a million times there's not any more like clips of me talking about how like oh yeah there is
[242:08.44]Every game on this list.
[242:10.70]Don't you understand, guys?
[242:12.77]Every single game on this list, there is a whole VOD of me talking about how much the game is a piece of shit and how I fucking hate it.
[242:20.23]And it's like the worst game I've ever played.
[242:22.77]Everyone on this list.
[242:33.26]That was really high, though.
[242:36.26]Ugh.
[242:39.03]I didn't beat this one.
[242:41.41]I did not beat getting over it.
[242:46.72]Show the hit and run meltdown clip.
[242:48.87]It's the whole broadcast.
[242:51.67]It's the entire broadcast.
[242:54.47]That was like a 12-hour stream.
[242:57.28]After the first 45 minutes, that's all it was.
[243:00.38]That stream, Simpsons hit and run, that one day of streaming Simpsons hit and run, I believe was the equivalent of me smoking 5,000 to 6,000 packs of cigarettes.
[243:11.28]That's like the amount of damage it did to my life.
[243:13.42]That's the amount of damage it did to my brain.
[243:22.03]Like if I went to get like a chest x-ray, they'd be like, what's happened?
[243:25.87]Do you smoke?
[243:27.49]Do you smoke cigarettes?
[243:28.89]It looks like you've been a smoker for a long time.
[243:31.21]I'd be like, no, I haven't smoked ever in my whole life.
[243:34.72]Oh.
[243:36.16]What happened then?
[243:37.14]Oh, well, you know.
[243:39.12]A few of these fucking games that, you know, hard games like Simpsons hit and run.
[243:44.64]Like I would have damage that you could see on like an x-ray.
[243:52.73]Anyways.
[243:55.85]I didn't play this.
[244:06.20]There's a clip in that one too.
[244:07.90]When I talk about how stupid the devs are.
[244:11.72]This is a horrible epiphany I'm having.
[244:14.69]I'm being shown all of my demons at once.
[244:18.33]Are you sweating?
[244:20.33]Yeah, it's fucking hot.
[244:24.94]Yeah, there's a part where I'm in the Steam room and I'm like, this is the worst game I've ever played.
[244:27.92]Like, all the devs are fucking morons.
[244:33.97]Like, I am being shown all of my bullshit right now.
[244:43.35]I mean, Hotline Miami 2 was so unbearable.
[244:46.61]I would put it here.
[244:47.21]But at least I beat it.
[244:50.80]Was that worse than Hit Simpsons?
[244:52.42]Probably not.
[244:59.78]I haven't played Ghouls and Ghosts.
[245:03.56]My Summer Car.
[245:06.02]I mean, I played it, but I thought it wasn't hard or anything, was it?

[245:12.32]Didn't really play it.
[245:13.56]Didn't play Boshi.

[245:19.81]Didn't play Dead Cells.

[246:32.28]Okay.
[246:38.94]Um... Your Thanksgiving tier list was awful, but this is a redemption.
[246:47.90]Dark Souls 2 is... Eh, it's kind of... I don't know if it was harder than all these, but it was a lot of stuff going on.
[246:56.72]I wasn't a big fan of Dark Souls 2.
[246:58.38]Um...
[247:02.84]Darkest Dungeon was really annoying, but it was still doable.
[247:07.65]Although, no, I never beat it.
[247:08.51]I actually did not beat the Darkest Dungeon.
[247:10.41]I did not.

[249:23.44]Good job, Nicholas.
[249:24.22]I mean, that was kind of rude, but I... It was like... I said a lot more awful things, I think, on this one.

[267:11.01]If I get it wrong, I'm just going to skip.
[267:12.05]I don't even care.
[267:14.11]So North Carolina, South Carolina.
[267:17.27]Yep.
[267:17.93]West Virginia.

[267:46.47]Alabama.
[267:49.80]Mississippi, Alabama, or Alabama, Mississippi.
[268:01.47]North Dakota is north.
[268:02.95]Yeah, I know, but I don't know exactly where the borders are.
[268:05.71]Because, like, Wyoming's huge.
[268:07.52]Montana's huge, aren't they?
[268:09.46]It's like here.
[268:11.72]I got it.
[268:12.14]Okay.
[268:16.02]So what is next to North Dakota?
[268:23.83]What is this?
[268:24.99]What the hell is this place?
[268:27.55]Missouri?
[268:28.17]That's Missouri.
[268:28.57]Missouri.
[269:05.23]Okay.
[269:08.19]How do I make it?
[269:11.47]To Europe?
[269:12.47]Okay, this is Neuroblender.
[269:15.18]Jerma has a fun day at the beach.
[269:16.40]He makes a sand castle.
[269:17.62]How does this work?
[269:30.42]In progress.
[269:33.67]Neuroblender can be unsafe for work sometimes.
[269:36.53]Oh, shit.
[269:37.51]Well, let's go ahead and fucking make sure I don't show that.
[269:44.41]It takes a little bit to make it right.
[269:45.73]How about this one?
[269:50.15]How about the video game sound effects quiz?
[269:53.27]Let's see if I can get this right.
[269:54.23]Let's go like this.
[270:08.95]Make it a little bit bigger.
[270:19.96]Drink it more.
[270:21.00]Okay, so I just input what I think it is.
[270:23.10]Okay, well, I'll try.
[270:36.66]Alright, number one is... That hurt my head, but that is Mario?
[270:45.97]Input answer, like Mario Jump?
[270:54.94]Does it have to be like Super Mario?
[270:57.90]Oh, okay, good, okay.
[271:06.42]World of Warcraft, that is the you completed a quest sound.
[271:13.46]World of Warcraft?

[271:19.65]Super hot?
[271:20.07]I mean, that was pretty easy.
[271:27.21]Major fracture detected.
[271:29.16]That's a Half-Life.
[271:36.20]Thank you.
[271:36.70]What was the name before?
[271:38.09]I only know that because I do that voice like every week.
[271:43.95]What was the name before?
[271:50.84]What was that?
[271:56.40]Put it in emote only mode.
[271:57.92]Emote only.
[271:58.53]Emote only.
[271:59.07]Emote only.
[271:59.49]I don't want to see it.
[272:09.52]I don't know.
[272:11.12]Die, monster.
[272:12.74]You don't belong in this world.

[272:50.66]What is it?
[272:51.08]How do I spell it?
[272:55.51]Duke Nukem.
[272:56.75]Nukem.
[272:57.41]Nukem.
[272:58.21]Am I spelling it wrong?
[272:58.97]Hail to the king, baby.
[273:02.53]It's Duke Nukem.
[273:11.90]How do I spell this?
[273:18.70]Is it not?
[273:19.34]It's not Duke Nukem?
[273:23.14]Duke Nukem.

[273:41.84]It's Tony Hawk.
[273:44.81]That's Tony Hawk's pro skater.
[273:46.81]What?
[273:48.75]That's when you do like a trick.
[273:49.77]Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[273:52.25]Tony Hawk.
[273:56.91]It has to be completely spelled accurately.
[274:00.73]That's The Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time.
[274:03.56]Thank you.
[274:14.73]Uh, Final Fantasy X. Dark Souls.
[274:24.68]That's the new area.
[274:25.44]You found a new area in Dark Souls.
[274:28.46]Or, like, you just, you resurrected.

[275:05.92]A pathetic creature of meat and bone.

[275:25.62]This is a new day on a game.
[275:28.60]This is a new day.
[275:29.92]We started a new day.
[275:35.46]But what game is this a new day of?
[275:45.73]Shit, I'll come back to it.
[275:46.97]That's Mario.
[275:50.29]Super- Do I have to get the whole thing?
[275:52.45]Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island.

[276:08.14]How do I say- It's Excite-A-Bike.
[276:09.62]Excite-Bike.
[276:15.08]Excite a bike?
[276:17.85]Excite bike.
[276:20.35]That's right, though, isn't it?
[276:26.91]Excite bike.
[276:30.68]I don't think I got that.
[276:31.60]Maybe it's not right.
[276:33.04]Sonic the Hedgehog, rings, rim removed.
[276:38.00]How come Sonic the Hedgehog doesn't need to be spelled out, but the other ones do?
[276:44.47]Minecraft.

[279:43.24]It's a party game.
[279:44.28]It's Mario... Golf?
[279:47.04]It's Mario Golf.
[279:47.68]Alright, what other games is Waluigi in?

[281:47.85]What have I got?
[281:49.61]Crash Bandicoot.
[282:00.78]It's like hitting the back button in a game.
[282:02.26]It's like a Resident Evil type game.
[282:05.30]Might be Resident Evil 3, maybe Resident Evil.
[282:07.94]Let's see if I get it.
[282:09.62]No, what is it?
[282:10.58]It's like one of those kinds of games.

[284:08.35]It's some kind of Mario game.
[284:09.61]I don't know which one though.
[284:10.71]What's going on with my hair?
[284:11.73]What happened?
[284:16.25]It could be anything.
[284:18.15]I don't know, like Toy Story?
[284:27.06]Aliens?
[284:36.35]I don't know.
[284:37.91]Doesn't somebody go like... Like Goofy who falls down?
[284:54.25]Something like that, right?
[284:55.06]What is it?
[285:06.77]No fucking idea.
[285:08.99]Okay.

[285:20.72]I have absolutely no- Silent Hill, maybe?
[285:24.04]Silent Hill 2?
[285:24.88]No, it's not Silent Hill.
[285:34.36]Just sounds like the guy from Silent Hill 2.
[285:42.65]This is a heartbeat, maybe?
[285:43.79]I don't know.
[285:44.73]Hail to the king, baby.
[285:46.29]How is this not Duke Nukem?
[285:48.63]Somebody explain that to me.
[285:50.31]Duke Nuke Dashum?
[285:53.61]Duke Nukem.
[285:56.61]This is Duke Nukem.
[285:59.81]Duke Nukem.
[286:02.30]How do you spell it?
[286:07.15]This is Duke Nukem.
[286:16.67]How am I getting this so wrong?
[286:18.46]Duke Nukem.
[286:29.16]It's not like... No, it's a K.
[286:32.81]Duke Nukem.
[286:34.73]Nukem.
[286:35.45]Nukem.
[286:36.85]Nukem.
[286:38.57]Nukem.
[286:40.07]Nukem.
[286:40.97]No, it's Duke Nukem.

[286:47.05]What?
[286:47.39]Duke Nukem.
[286:48.31]Duke... Duke...
[286:59.13]Is it one word?
[286:59.93]No spaces or anything?
[287:02.57]Is it an underscore?
[287:03.57]I think it's an underscore.
[287:10.98]Hail to the king, baby.
[287:12.66]Why are you guys doing Doritos?
[287:16.58]Hail to the king, baby.
[287:18.34]I don't get it.
[287:20.56]I don't know why.
[287:21.08]I don't know what that... I can't spell it.
[287:26.64]This is like a railgun.
[287:28.48]Wake up.
[287:32.80]What was the Unreal?
[287:37.08]Unreal Tournament?
[287:39.12]Why are you guys doing all the Doritos stuff?
[287:51.33]I just had it in my head.
[287:52.29]I just had it.
[287:52.69]It's Heroes of Might and Magic.
[287:56.89]I had it.
[288:03.65]Got it.
[288:03.91]This is another one of the dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[288:11.94]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[288:13.68]Pokémon.
[288:17.99]Yep.
[288:22.33]I'm never going to get this.
[288:23.77]I will never get this one.
[288:31.65]Probably not going to get that one either.
[288:32.83]Jason!
[288:34.23]Or that one.
[288:36.03]Is this Team Fortress?
[288:46.93]No.
[288:50.78]I was thinking like the sniper rifle.
[288:53.62]No, that's Call of Duty.
[288:58.34]CS, go.
[288:58.82]Counter-strike.
[289:04.30]Yes, there it is.
[289:05.52]It's the same sounds.
[289:06.90]They used the source engine.
[289:07.84]Same goddamn sounds.
[289:12.43]Professor.
[289:12.87]Professor Layton.
[289:16.87]What?
[289:21.49]That's Professor Layton.
[289:24.05]It's a raid?
[289:24.80]Oh shit, who raided?
[289:25.52]Did we get a raid?
[289:33.89]Can't see it from here.
[289:34.49]Hold on.
[289:40.68]Who raided?
[289:41.82]We're in emote-only mode right now?
[289:44.02]You're liars.
[289:44.80]Nobody raided.
[289:45.42]There's no raid.
[289:47.63]You guys are lying.
[289:48.37]There's no raid.
[289:52.89]Anyways, what were we doing?
[289:53.93]Right.
[289:57.15]That's like Professor Layton.
[289:59.27]In all the Professor Layton games, I have no idea what they're... There's a colon, and then it's like a bunch of word soup.
[290:05.07]It could be... Professor Layton and the ungodly kitty from London.
[290:08.94]Like, I have no idea what the fuck these names are.
[290:15.10]Professor Layton and the magical grandfather clock.
[290:17.34]I don't... I should be able to get this one.
[290:23.09]You guys keep saying raid.
[290:23.95]I don't see any raids.
[290:24.83]Why are you saying raid?
[290:32.37]Oh, you're just a spoiler!
[290:45.72]Thank you.
[290:46.50]I appreciate it.
[290:53.62]I don't under- What could this possibly be?
[290:59.35]Mario Golf, Mario Tennis, Mario Soccer.
[291:02.85]Let me spell it out.
[291:04.15]Mario Super Star Sluggers or something, right?
[291:14.10]Maybe it's Mario Party, like, I have to maybe put a number?
[291:25.54]I don't know.
[291:28.62]Mario Party.
[291:29.46]Mario Pizza.
[291:31.88]That's not a game.
[291:32.50]I don't know why I'm thinking that.
[291:33.58]Mario... Singing.
[291:44.16]It's Waluigi, but I don't have any idea.
[291:47.64]He's not in any other games, is he?
[291:55.17]Combine?
[291:55.61]This is Half-Life.
[291:59.44]It's not the Combine.
[292:00.50]It's something like that.
[292:08.38]I don't know.
[292:08.84]I can't get it.
[292:10.78]This is like you're in the menu.
[292:19.28]You're in like and you're like... I don't know what menu it is though.
[292:25.44]Is that like Bowser?
[292:37.80]Or is this Luigi's Mansion?
[292:44.56]That's like a Mario enemy.
[292:46.50]Mario, not 64.
[292:47.38]Mario Sunshine?
[292:49.66]Mario Odyssey?
[293:00.13]It's like Bowser.
[293:00.97]He comes over and he's like... Ninja Kazooie?
[293:18.12]That's Mario Party.
[293:26.44]Ow.
[293:33.21]No, that's Pikmin!
[293:39.97]No, that could be a guy doing that.
[293:43.11]It's not even like a sound effect from a game.
[293:55.27]Animal Crossing?
[293:55.95]I feel like it might be Animal Crossing.
[294:06.18]I don't know.
[294:10.50]This one.
[294:12.12]What is it?
[294:13.36]It's like...

[294:19.81]It goes like... It's... Right?
[294:36.65]Oh my god, what is it?
[294:39.61]Somebody over this sound makes like a high-pitched sound effect.
[294:42.87]It's like...
[294:59.93]That's something going... What is it though?
[295:06.49]It's like a star or like a collectible and it blows up.
[295:08.91]What is it?
[295:14.65]It shows up on the screen.
[295:15.97]Boom!
[295:16.31]You collected it.
[295:20.37]Maybe this is Mario Odyssey.
[295:24.63]How the fuck do you spell Odyssey?
[295:27.97]Mario Galaxy.
[295:33.62]Mario Sunshine Mario 60 no Mario 64 goes here we go die monster you don't belong in this world um house of the dead I feel like it could be house of the dead

[296:10.40]You don't belong in this world.
[296:15.21]Hail to the king, baby.
[296:17.73]Doesn't make any sense that this is not Duke Nukem.
[296:19.79]There's nobody else that is.
[296:20.97]That's Duke Nukem talking.
[296:27.50]Jason!

[296:51.71]Cheesy?
[296:52.97]Cheezum.

[297:02.07]Cheez it?
[297:02.59]I don't know.
[297:03.07]What are you trying to say?

[297:14.34]I don't know what you're trying to convey to me.
[297:15.82]I don't know.
[297:16.52]I can't figure it out.
[297:18.14]I have no idea.
[297:20.24]I think I'm going to have to reveal.
[297:24.23]This is like Galaga or... It's an old game, like an old Atari game.

[298:20.04]I thought I was losing my mind.
[298:21.28]I was like, who else is this supposed to be?
[298:26.30]Alien Isolation.

[299:18.35]I thought that was Waluigi winning a game of Mario Tennis.
[299:23.16]Where did I write Luigi's Mansion?
[299:28.36]I wrote Luigi's Mansion for one of these and I got it wrong.

[309:07.29]Still in progress.
[309:08.15]It's taking a while.
[309:08.95]It's trying to figure out what to do.
[309:14.57]And I'm going to do the thing I do every time I do this.
[309:17.41]I hopefully doesn't take this.
[309:18.43]It takes between 10 minutes and 15 minutes.
[309:20.79]We're just, we're just going to do another fucking IQ test.
[309:22.81]Like, I mean, I'm going to do this.
[309:25.06]I'm not really ready.
[309:27.00]I haven't like eaten any protein today or anything.
[309:29.42]So I'm telling you right now, this is probably going to be very inaccurate.
[309:32.98]We take an IQ test every time just to make sure that I'm still above at least like 60 IQ.
[309:38.88]Who knows?
[309:39.33]Here we go again.
[309:40.59]Begin assessment.

[313:06.46]For example, the two shapes below are the same, just viewed from a different direction.
[313:11.92]But the next two shapes are actually different.
[313:14.28]See the animation that shows they are mirror images.
[313:18.58]So I have to pick the things that are the same image.
[313:30.93]Which of these shapes are the same?
[313:35.25]Oh god, I'm gonna get an F. Relax.
[313:47.93]Not this one.

[315:46.51]I'm practically intelligent.
[315:49.23]I'm not on paper intelligent.
[315:50.29]I'm practically intelligent.
[315:58.29]Where do you use this?
[315:59.22]Alright.
[315:59.72]Go out and find me a situation where you can, like, get yourself out of trouble with this one.
[316:07.25]How do you solve a problem with this one?
[316:17.22]It's not, okay, it's not this one.
[316:19.16]It isn't.
[316:19.82]Not this one.
[316:21.26]Not this one.
[316:21.96]Wait, maybe it is this one.
[316:23.84]It is this one.
[316:27.33]This is going the wrong direction.
[316:28.61]Nope, it's this one.
[316:37.11]How do I spin this?
[316:38.01]It's this one?
[316:40.25]Turn it, tilt it, spin it.
[316:41.11]Flat.
[316:41.23]Turn it.
[316:41.71]This is wrong.
[316:42.55]Flat.
[316:42.67]Turn it.
[316:43.15]Put it flat.
[316:43.51]What do we want?
[316:44.49]Wrong.
[316:44.77]Okay, flat.
[316:45.11]This way.
[317:17.12]stop it this one goes wing wing wing goes wing wing wing goes wrong this one goes this one
[317:47.24]off this one this is incorrect it's going the wrong way if I take this and I turn it it would be going this is correct if I put it flat and turn it this is wrong
[318:11.80]it's cringe alright you know if I if you had 10 50 500 000 people breathing down your neck while you take an IQ test you don't think you'd have a little bit of trouble there's like 500 000 people breathing down my neck right now I I can't get away from me okay let's relax and go for it this is going this way this one's wrong in the lower left
[318:36.26]I believe this one's accurate.
[318:37.20]If I flip it up, going this way, that way, and if I turn it, this one's correct.
[318:45.51]This one might be correct.
[318:46.41]Hold on.
[318:46.69]If I take it like this, and I flip it, no, if I flip it this way, no, it's wrong.
[318:53.87]If I stand this one up, turn it, this one's correct.
[319:05.27]Oh, yikes.
[319:07.55]What is playing right now?
[319:10.51]Oh, my God.
[319:11.13]This is like Fortnite music?
[319:17.53]What do you mean, no?
[319:18.37]Whatever.
[319:18.67]You take it.
[319:19.09]Okay.
[319:20.75]Can I just skip this one and just get enough?
[319:21.89]This one... Oh, yeah.
[319:28.01]It goes down.
[319:30.29]It goes right down, left down.
[319:34.10]Right down, left down.
[319:35.34]So if I take this one and I flip it up, go right down, left down.
[319:41.68]Holy shit.
[319:42.24]This is hard.
[319:46.49]I turn this one.
[319:47.41]This is correct.
[319:56.78]I put this up and turn it.
[320:00.00]It goes that way down, right down.
[320:04.04]This is not correct.
[320:07.39]I take this one and I flip it.
[320:09.77]Oh yeah, this is fucking hard.
[320:11.27]This is really hard.
[320:20.69]If I turn this one that way, it goes... Yeah, it's this one.
[320:23.88]Alright, I'm done.
[320:25.88]Visual memory subtest.
[320:27.08]You'll be shown a grid with some cells shaded for five seconds.
[320:32.14]Then you'll have to reproduce that sample pattern from memory as best as you can.
[320:35.74]Okay?
[320:36.70]So just fill in the shades.
[320:40.59]Memorize the arrangement.
[320:41.55]Got it.
[320:48.70]Thank you.
[321:41.01]Fuck, where was this one?
[321:41.67]I don't remember.
[322:02.41]Nailed it!
[322:04.83]In this section, you'll be- you will be a list.
[322:08.41]You'll see a list of scrambled letters.
[322:10.99]And ask to find as many as you can that can be unscrambled into real English words.
[322:16.95]Oh, shit.
[322:18.45]Okay, I have to unsc... Oh, I'm so bad at these ones.
[322:20.45]I'm so bad at this.
[322:21.39]Select as many po... Wait, hold on.
[322:27.76]Select as many as possible that can be unscrambled into an English word.
[322:34.20]Uh... Or...

[324:02.70]Ah, I fucked it up.
[324:03.72]That.
[324:04.80]I've screwed it up.
[324:06.92]I can't concentrate anymore.
[324:13.06]Disk.
[324:15.66]Brain.
[324:16.06]Tail.

[325:00.50]Thep.
[325:02.80]Peth.
[325:03.90]Peths.
[325:07.61]Hep.
[325:10.84]I'm so bad at these.
[325:33.13]I can't.
[325:34.17]I can't do it.
[325:35.09]My brain can't do it.
[325:36.53]I can't do these.
[325:37.37]I'm so fucking bad at these.
[325:40.14]Oh no.
[325:41.48]This doesn't even mean anything.
[325:42.78]I'm gonna try to fucking destroy you in arm wrestling, okay?
[325:46.46]It's an old joke.
[325:48.40]Alright, in this task you'll be given a grid with some points shaded in green.
[325:52.69]You will need to select the point that is most in the middle of all of them.
[326:03.60]The one that has the lowest average distance from it to each of the green points.
[326:07.84]For example, in the grid below, what point is closest to all three green points at the same time?
[326:14.59]It would be like 1, 2, 3.
[326:18.13]1, 2, 3.
[326:19.23]Something like here, maybe?
[326:20.33]Here?
[326:24.26]Here?
[326:27.46]Two possible answers are below.
[326:29.72]Blue lines have been added to show how good each is.
[326:35.63]So it has to be like an equal distance away from everything.
[326:38.45]Do I have that correct?
[326:39.60]Did I get that right?
[326:40.64]I just got resident sleepered.
[326:43.46]Sorry, man.
[326:44.66]What happened to my... So it has to be like an equal distance away from all of them.
[326:49.22]Alright, let's just go for it.
[326:50.30]No, I got that wrong?
[326:51.06]What do you mean?
[326:54.13]It was the most in the middle of all of them.
[326:57.71]Oh, I see.
[326:58.13]Okay.
[327:02.73]This one.
[327:05.93]Oh, I thought I got it wrong.
[327:06.87]I was like, what the fuck?
[327:07.61]Okay.
[327:13.73]What?
[327:22.58]Point closest to all the points.
[327:26.02]It would have to be, like, up.
[327:28.54]What?
[327:28.82]Oh, no.
[327:32.61]Oh.
[327:39.74]I don't know.
[327:41.23]I can't get this open.
[327:46.21]I can't physically open this.
[327:48.75]Oh, it's because I have to take the seal off.
[327:51.47]The point closest to all the green points.
[327:53.31]It just has to be one of these, right?
[327:58.14]It doesn't matter which one.
[328:00.84]Oh, that is a trick question.
[328:02.24]Okay.
[328:04.18]Closest to all the green points.
[328:07.78]It'd be like here.
[328:09.76]Here.
[328:11.60]Here.
[328:14.24]What?
[328:14.44]This is the point in the middle?
[328:17.72]It'd be like this one.
[328:25.78]I don't know.
[328:32.69]I thought... I'm thinking like... I don't know why I thought that.
[328:37.58]I'm thinking like they all like meet at this point.
[328:40.54]I'm getting it wrong Jesus Christ It's me the middle the middle most point Okay, it's definitely like here.
[328:52.49]We're here here here What the fuck are you talking about?
[328:59.15]What?
[328:59.45]Because this has to travel this has to travel this has to travel
[329:13.78]Who fucking cares about this?
[329:25.59]Here?
[329:28.32]Oh, come on.
[329:29.98]That's close.
[329:33.42]The middle most point from here.
[329:35.58]This has to be like here or here, right?
[329:39.15]I don't get it.
[329:41.43]How is this the middle-most point?
[329:43.85]What?
[329:44.95]I don't get it.
[329:52.93]I don't understand how that's the middle-most point.
[329:54.57]Closest to all of them.
[330:02.53]Holy shit, I'm gonna... They're gonna ask me if I'm alive.
[330:07.48]I'm going to get a thing at the end.
[330:08.42]This is going to say, hey, please, it's funny, but no dead people can take this test.
[330:16.20]I've been just putting this on.
[330:17.26]It's all over my mouth.
[330:27.44]That was close.
[330:31.50]It definitely has to be up here somewhere.
[330:33.72]Like here.
[330:34.92]Something stupid.
[330:36.40]That was also close.
[330:37.30]The difficult ones are getting better.
[330:44.69]Almost nailed it.
[330:45.51]I'm getting better.
[330:52.42]This is probably right in the middle.
[330:54.56]Getting better.
[330:55.00]Right here.
[331:00.72]I'm like within one or two spots each time.
[331:02.96]So I'm not, I'm not upset about this.
[331:06.34]This one could be anywhere.
[331:09.20]Do I have Fortnite music on?
[331:12.32]Let me get this shit off.
[331:23.57]I'm also listening to like Fortnite music.
[331:25.47]Like you don't think that's messing with my head doing the IQ test?
[331:41.21]we go okay better close oh I did wait did you kick me out did I fail I was only like 16. I was getting too many wrong I got slaughter ruled
[332:03.76]In this subtest, you'll be shown a sequence of icons one at a time.
[332:07.08]Then you'll be shown eight icons and asked which were in the sequence you just saw.
[332:11.40]So I'm going to be shown icons and I have to say which ones were in which order.
[332:18.84]Okay.
[332:39.05]I fucked it up.
[332:40.15]I started listening to Stardew Valley music.
[332:43.75]I was just like, oh, Stardew Valley is really cool, and it was gone.
[333:00.88]What if it's not on here?
[333:05.95]Wait.
[333:06.95]Hold on a second.
[333:09.25]Wait, wait a minute.
[333:10.35]Wait a minute.
[333:10.99]It's not show- I'm not clicking them in sequence.
[333:13.87]I have to- Oh, I- Well, now I have no fucking idea.
[333:19.94]I did not understand the instructions.
[333:28.06]God, I- I don't know.
[333:29.29]I think this- I don't know.
[333:32.07]Now I get it.
[333:48.76]It's too hard to remember these.
[334:25.29]No, they put a check on it.
[334:26.37]They're fucking with me.
[334:29.67]Man, I mean, this was the first one.
[334:31.78]This one... No, this is... Was this one?
[334:35.30]This one.
[334:36.62]This one.
[334:37.32]This one.
[334:37.76]I think.
[334:39.42]I think.
[335:02.44]Oh, I did it.
[335:04.74]You want to answer some research questions?
[335:06.28]No.
[335:07.99]Okay, what is it?
[335:12.35]Get out of here!
[335:17.89]117.
[335:23.45]Oh, I don't know where I am, but... Oh, I thought it was going to be like 85.
[335:28.61]Okay.
[335:35.32]1.17, it's gone down.
[335:37.47]I want to make that clear.
[335:39.19]I've taken an IQ test before, a real one, twice.
[335:44.76]The first time I took it, and by the way, IQ test takes usually like a couple of hours.
[335:48.16]Like it takes like an hour plus.
[335:53.75]When I first took an IQ test when I was like 17 or so, I had 126.
[335:56.28]And then it went down to like 124.
[335:58.52]And now it's 117.
[335:58.82]It was 124 in college.
[335:59.38]And now it's apparently 117.
[335:59.96]It's probably lower than this.
[336:01.54]It's probably like... It's probably like 110, probably, for real.
[336:04.18]99.
[336:04.20]Look at my memory.
[336:04.62]I'm doing fine.
[336:21.96]Look at this!
[336:22.83]Come on!
[336:23.53]Look where I am!
[336:26.47]This is where I sit.
[336:29.97]This isn't a real test.
[336:31.11]Are you sure?
[336:34.38]I thought a psychologist was giving this to me.
[336:36.68]Are you sure we can't use this in court or whatever?
[336:38.92]Oh, IQ tests are bullshit anyways!
[336:51.86]Imagine if I got, like, fucking, like, 140.
[336:53.86]There, print it.
[337:01.08]Print screen.
[337:04.23]Well, this explains why I have a lot of trouble, like, walking around a concrete building in Hitman.
[337:10.05]I do have a pretty good memory.
[337:18.62]Pretty good.
[337:19.40]Not great.
[337:20.76]Pretty good.
[337:22.34]Alright, what the hell?
[337:23.11]Oh, right, the neural network thing.
[337:25.27]Make sure it's not somebody's ball sack or something.
[337:28.51]Let's find out.
[337:37.52]I can't.
[337:37.96]It's hard to tell what this is.
[337:49.02]It's so hard to tell if this is like an asshole or something.
[337:53.06]Because I don't know.
[337:57.70]It could be.
[338:02.81]Let me just make sure it's not.
[338:04.65]Hold on.
[338:16.42]Yeah, I don't know.
[338:17.32]I can't tell.
[338:22.42]This is like a pair of legs on the left and it's like somebody's asshole.
[338:26.46]Like going up to their asshole or something.
[338:28.06]I'm not showing it.
[338:30.31]This is... Jerma enjoys his favorite cheeseburger restaurant.
[338:50.25]What's the website?
[338:51.04]It's neuralblender.com apparently.
[338:57.19]I'll try another one.
[338:57.77]What should I do?
[339:00.01]Let's see.
[339:20.64]I have no idea what's going to happen with this one.
[339:26.44]We'll see.
[339:26.66]Alright.
[339:32.86]What time is it?
[339:33.54]Maybe time for a little bit more.
[339:35.24]What is this one?
[339:38.16]Oh, people want to be able to play this.
[339:43.64]This is called Monster Breeder.
[339:46.02]Is this game fun?
[339:58.58]This might take a full stream.
[340:00.44]It's really fun.
[340:02.70]Oh.
[340:06.75]You think so?
[340:13.51]Do I do music?
[340:15.11]What's... Somebody just said, what's the shitty music?
[340:22.94]I'm sorry.
[340:23.28]I just had a gastric upset there.
[340:25.20]I had an epigastric reflux there for a second.
[340:27.68]What did you say?
[340:29.54]You said Stardew Valley's music is bad?
[340:40.15]Come on, man.
[340:41.63]Come on.
[340:43.27]Okay.
[340:46.37]I'll check this out for a little bit.
[340:50.56]Have I been really streaming for, like, six hours?
[340:52.54]What the hell happened?
[340:53.14]Alright, music.
[340:59.04]Why not?
[341:03.46]I'll give it a try.
[341:06.38]You spent two hours on fast food.
