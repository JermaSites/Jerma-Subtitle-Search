[00:01.29]How are you doing?
[00:06.85]Good.
[00:08.03]Really, really good.
[00:11.23]I am glad to hear it.
[00:15.08]Stream's going to be bopping in the next minute or two.
[00:24.96]Tonight, we're going to do Kinect again.
[00:29.09]But we're going to be focused, laser focused, on horror games.
[00:37.90]We've got quite a selection.
[00:41.02]There are two.
[00:46.12]There are two of them.
[00:48.96]And one of them has really bad reviews.
[00:52.97]And the other one has really good reviews.
[00:56.83]So we're going to do them both.
[00:57.65]Because that's what we do here.
[01:00.83]We explore the entire gaming atmosphere.
[01:11.18]And I've got an even better hair solution today.
[01:13.78]I'll show you in just a second.
[01:18.35]Oh, and by the way, if you're good, I'm going to show you something remarkable later.
[01:28.16]Only if you're good.
[01:30.64]Only if you're good.
[01:40.54]I got my coffee.
[01:41.93]I've got my large water.
[01:46.73]I'm never going to be good.
[01:49.59]Well, you better be good.
[01:51.99]If that guy that said that is not good today, it ain't happening.
[01:58.93]We're going to start with Rise of Nightmares.
[02:03.24]It's going to be a coin flip to which one of these sucks.
[02:08.96]But I'm going to give it some time.
[02:13.24]I also lowered the volume of the lights in the room, too.
[02:18.63]I don't want it to be too loud in here.
[02:21.11]And yes, there are some denominations.
[02:23.27]Sound can be used as volume.
[02:28.47]That's a scientific term.
[02:30.67]It's dB.
[02:37.85]Let's go.
[02:41.80]Why didn't you just spit it out?
[02:42.60]Where the fuck are you going?
[02:46.16]Get in there.
[02:48.93]So here comes Rise of Nightmares.
[02:50.17]We're gonna start off like this.
[02:54.51]You should see it right now.
[02:56.91]You should also see me.
[02:57.99]Uh oh, they don't see me.
[03:06.53]Hold on, I gotta like fix this.
[03:08.29]It looks like I have a warped head.
[03:10.51]I promise I don't have a warped head.
[03:15.16]I had to have some kind of solution.
[03:17.32]Oh, this is gonna be up a little higher.
[03:21.36]What the fuck is this doing?
[03:22.96]Alright, the connect is moving.
[03:25.14]The connect is moving on its own.
[03:30.52]Okay, is this back better?
[03:39.25]Extend your hand forward to start.
[03:40.67]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:42.33]I gotta make sure this is in the right spot.
[03:46.89]That looks alright.
[03:49.26]Is it too loud?
[03:50.76]Well, it's a horror game.
[03:51.50]It's supposed to be fucking loud.
[03:53.86]You don't turn the volume down on a horror game.
[03:56.26]You turn it UP.
[03:57.48]Ah, today we're gonna play as Dave.
[04:13.77]Alright, we... I might need to recalibrate this thing.
[04:17.02]It's been a week.
[04:29.10]Create new save.
[04:29.92]Yes, please do.
[04:31.79]Is that one like the first element holding your hand this way?
[04:39.83]Wait, position check.
[04:40.91]You are now in the optimal play area.
[04:42.79]Extend your arm forward to begin.
[04:43.94]Is this matched up?
[04:46.20]Should be.
[04:46.54]Did you hear it?
[04:56.49]Brightness.
[04:57.95]Adjust the brightness so the triangle edge is visible, but the inner crest is not.
[05:06.56]I need to be able to see, you know what I mean?
[05:08.18]I don't know how people play horror games like this.
[05:14.92]Why would you ever turn it down like this?
[05:16.93]You can't see shit.
[05:18.19]You can't even play the game.
[05:22.77]Alright, we're gonna go right there, because I can see the outline.
[05:27.87]That's better, hold on.
[05:32.88]It feels good every time.
[05:36.02]New game, alright, play from the very beginning.
[05:37.58]I'm gonna get ready, because this is gonna scare my socks off.
[05:40.90]Wait, the camera's on a good spot, wait.
[05:47.16]I feel like I'm about to send a fucking birthday greeting to grandma.
[05:50.48]Wait, hold on, okay.
[05:53.17]Grandma, hap... No, look a little lower.
[05:59.92]Here we go.
[06:08.32]Uh, no mercy humane, or... Or, uh, every time streamer says something that has any base in science at all.
[06:20.65]Any time streamer says something...
[06:23.68]that you disagree with.
[06:27.09]Anytime a streamer says something that you didn't know before, but now you know now.
[06:36.01]No mercy.
[06:38.51]There we go.
[06:45.36]Is no mercy okay?
[06:46.58]The game difficulty can be changed.
[06:48.48]Yeah, that's fine.
[06:49.14]Let's go.
[06:55.78]Hold on real quick.
[06:58.74]This one's for moving, this one's for grooving.
[07:00.80]You know what I'm saying?
[07:04.80]No, don't even need it.
[07:09.46]Oh, he's going to spill it and it's going to be hilarious.
[07:15.81]Oh, question mark, he said something.
[07:17.27]Who the hell am I?
[07:28.17]Turn your shoulders left and right to rotate the camera.
[07:30.93]What was this shit?
[07:35.13]When you extend and hold your arm out towards the screen, the target pointer will be displayed.
[07:39.49]Okay.
[07:43.65]Interact with any object that has an interaction icon.
[07:47.90]That me?
[07:49.02]I don't speak French.
[07:51.64]She's gonna be like, crap!
[08:05.31]When you extend and hold your arm out towards the screen, the target pointer will be displayed.
[08:08.73]Yeah, alright.
[08:10.61]There's a pipe?
[08:11.15]I didn't even pick that up.
[08:18.66]By holding your arms like you're boxing, you will do a fighting stance.
[08:23.20]You can attack by swinging the weapon you're holding.
[08:33.75]Okay.
[08:34.89]Hit the chain.
[08:37.77]Hit the chain!
[08:39.85]It's a cutscene, isn't it?
[08:43.62]Chains holding doors shut can be broken with a weapon.
[08:45.82]First hit.
[08:48.58]Alright, now go on.
[08:58.36]Try opening this door just like you would in real life.
[09:02.05]How do you move?
[09:04.83]How do you walk?
[09:07.61]How do you walk?
[09:08.39]To move forward, place a foot out in front of you.
[09:11.30]Your speed changes based on how... Why am I walking like that?
[09:30.39]What the fuck is that?
[09:33.92]stop doing that I'm like the warner brothers frog this is odd alright hold on walk
[10:03.75]What the fuck?
[10:04.53]I can't move around.
[10:11.63]What?
[10:11.99]When you see an auto-movement icon displayed, hold up your right arm to move automatically.
[10:16.24]Yeah.
[10:17.24]Let's go.
[10:18.06]Automatically, please.
[10:21.98]Again.
[10:22.22]There ain't no way I'm gonna be able to do this.
[10:25.14]Somebody in here?
[10:35.56]Oh, there is somebody in here.
[10:45.53]Open the door.
[10:48.71]Alright, here we go.
[10:52.43]No.
[10:53.49]Can you get me back on track, please?
[10:55.37]Thank you.
[10:56.49]Can you do that again?
[10:57.87]Just get me back on track.
[10:58.93]I would appreciate it.
[11:01.07]Okay, thank you.
[11:05.80]Oh, you just hold it!
[11:08.18]You don't have to actually walk, you just slide your foot out.
[11:19.35]Can't open that door.
[11:23.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait, I go this way.
[11:28.99]Wait, wait, there's a thing!
[11:32.47]Pull up down.
[11:33.29]When the icon is displayed, you will need to perform a situational gesture.
[11:36.28]Ah, it's a pole.
[11:45.06]Uh-oh.
[11:50.67]I'm glad they closed the doors behind them.
[11:54.29]While in fighting stance, you don't have to make them focus on...
[12:10.28]Alright, that feels alright.
[12:12.52]Now what?
[12:19.05]How do I get over there?
[12:26.83]I pulled the lever- oh, there's another guy right here.
[12:39.51]Who's next?
[12:44.59]Can I run?
[12:45.21]Or do I just have to walk like this?
[12:47.53]Turning... You won't be able to turn while focused, so remember to drop both arms when you want to turn.
[12:52.85]Oh.
[13:04.72]They're just waiting for you to kill them.
[13:07.61]Got it.
[13:12.95]Open the door.
[13:16.89]That's bullshit.
[13:18.25]Alright, let me tell you something.
[13:19.23]If you are like a building contractor or you're like an architect, handle is pull, plate is push.
[13:26.10]I don't know, how the fuck do we not understand this?
[13:28.60]It's been like 60 years of this.
[13:32.98]What am I supposed to do in here?
[13:39.76]And sometimes some buildings have half of them are push for plate and half of them are like push.
[13:46.34]They go half and half.
[13:47.20]It's fucked up.
[13:50.22]Why am I in here?
[13:54.39]Just do it for me.
[13:59.47]Boy, that went both ways.
[14:01.89]That door is on like an axle.
[14:05.37]Do it for me.
[14:15.25]Hey, it's me.
[14:16.62]I thought I got you.
[14:17.50]Now what?
[14:22.31]Are you looking to follow me?
[14:33.54]What are you saying?
[14:34.56]You're on autopilot.
[14:35.46]Big bits can't prove it.
[14:36.96]Shit, I can't feel it.
[14:38.72]Uh-oh.
[14:38.84]It's one of those monsters!
[14:39.54]Where did you go?
[14:40.06]Where did you go?
[15:09.67]How do you run?
[15:17.43]It's blood.
[15:17.85]I don't like this.
[15:18.73]I don't like blood.
[15:19.53]Oh, shit.
[15:22.29]Okay.
[15:24.68]I can do it!
[15:53.51]Well, we both died.
[16:08.40]Now I'm going to be a reporter.
[16:10.24]Coming to investigate the scene, right?
[16:21.15]The ice is already melted.
[16:22.90]It's so hot here.
[16:23.68]Alright, that was a cool game.
[16:26.03]What's next?
[16:27.47]This.
[16:30.21]But, like, the next seven to twelve hundred... I'm gonna be a reporter.
[16:37.43]Come on.
[16:44.85]Notice how I said seven to twelve hundred.
[16:48.43]That is seven with no digits after it.
[16:50.74]Can you hear me?
[16:53.02]Hey, can you take those out for a minute?
[16:56.35]Hey, wake up.
[16:57.23]Come on, Josh, it's our vacation.
[17:01.13]Oh, shit, the walls.
[17:02.59]The train.
[17:03.85]Listen, I want to talk to you about something.
[17:10.24]Don't worry.
[17:11.34]It's good news.
[17:17.29]Josh?
[17:18.77]You're hiding booze in your jacket?
[17:20.31]I take my eyes off of you for... Why would you take it out of your pocket?
[17:29.34]When I asked you to cut back on the drinking, I didn't mean you should start hiding it.
[17:37.07]Look, I hate sounding like a nagging wife, but I've been putting up with this for five years.
[17:45.41]When do you grow up?
[17:52.11]Excuse you work Josh, but I can't with you at the bottom.
[17:55.26]We don't typically listen to private conversations I can't do this right now, okay?
[18:03.48]I'm sorry.
[18:04.12]I was just completely eavesdropping in front of you of your private conversation Alright, let's go need to wake up head to the bath a splash of cold water will help oh
[18:16.74]Bathroom.
[18:18.86]We don't have a pause menu, but okay.
[18:28.56]I am like drunk right now.
[18:32.84]Where's that bathroom?
[18:35.67]I think it's this one.
[18:38.65]He's gonna go
[18:47.45]Ready?
[18:48.05]One, two, three.
[18:53.89]Into the mirror.
[18:55.21]Whoa, what were you drinking?
[19:05.28]What the hell?
[19:16.46]Did he have, like, horns?
[19:21.40]Find Kate.
[19:25.78]What did you do?
[19:27.40]What did you do?
[19:28.68]You did something.
[19:30.40]Help.
[19:51.56]Where's the letter?
[19:54.18]Sorry I got angry.
[19:56.12]I'm not myself lately.
[19:58.10]Meet me in the dining car.
[20:00.18]One for Kate.
[20:01.52]Kate, you used way too much paper for this.
[20:05.06]Now, the way to correct this would be to write it gigantically.
[20:09.80]Like a second-grader.
[20:11.92]I would not be as angry as I am now.
[20:16.11]Head to the dining car.
[20:31.72]This really is very difficult to navigate.
[20:37.34]Alright, wait, stop, stop, don't walk into the wall.
[20:40.98]I'm not moving.
[20:48.26]Look out the window?
[20:50.72]Looks like it's gonna rain.
[20:52.06]Guess the weather has a sense of humor.
[20:58.82]Are you gonna cheat me for looking out the fucking window?
[21:02.68]God, they really tacked these on back in the 360 day.
[21:05.04]Remember this shit?
[21:09.32]Oh yeah, this game has 120,000 achievements!
[21:15.78]Five points!
[21:18.18]For shooting your first round!
[21:23.28]Attencie la traversaria in Trevavani.
[21:33.29]Can I pass this?
[21:33.81]What are you doing?
[21:38.91]Can I go by?
[21:39.21]Excuse me, I'd like to pass.
[21:40.37]What do I have to do?
[21:40.99]Is this going to teach me how to crouch?
[22:02.92]I actually have to, are you serious?
[22:07.62]Why wouldn't you just put your down to the leg?
[22:15.12]What's so funny over here?
[22:18.60]Hey.
[22:18.74]Hi guys.
[22:19.02]Yeah.
[22:30.86]They're disconnected from Xbox.
[22:47.35]I know this trick.
[22:48.87]They did this shoot at the weekend at Bernie's.
[22:50.91]That guy's not real.
[22:51.83]That guy's not alive.
[22:52.61]There's somebody up in the luggage cabin holding him up.
[23:20.33]Are you on a phone?
[23:29.97]I'm just rude.
[23:31.79]Oh!
[23:33.31]Ow!
[23:33.59]Sorry.
[23:33.93]These old Soviet rail cars buck like Shropshire ponies.
[23:41.77]So who's this?
[23:43.47]Right.
[23:44.29]Well, I'm sure I'll see you around.
[23:50.20]I'm gonna, I'm missing something.
[23:51.86]Right?
[23:52.50]I'm missing something.
[23:55.06]That was like the oldest trick in the book.
[23:56.30]That's the like, I bumped into you and like my colleague came and like grabbed like something out of your backpack.
[24:02.42]What?
[24:03.56]What am I doing?
[24:04.06]The fuck?
[24:12.20]What was I supposed to do?
[24:15.89]I was supposed to find like the dinner card.
[24:18.27]It's taking a lot more time than I thought it was going to take.
[24:22.33]Anyone in there?
[24:34.80]Oh, we've got somebody in here.
[24:35.88]Gentlemen?
[24:40.33]How are you?
[24:41.61]American.
[24:44.51]Whoa, I'm a friendly bunch.
[24:48.12]Actually, uh, I'm Canadian.
[24:52.85]Fucking assholes.
[24:59.23]Free shit?
[25:06.55]Oh, right this way, sir!
[25:07.47]Come on, tell me where to go.
[25:08.85]Why'd you just drop everything?
[25:15.78]I'm not going in there.
[25:16.78]You can't pass without your ticket.
[25:18.99]Well, it's in there.
[25:20.01]Can you go in there?
[25:22.65]Can you knock on the curtain?
[25:29.75]You want to find your wife?
[25:34.74]Sit.
[25:35.74]What the fuck?
[25:37.68]That guy's waiting up there.
[25:38.68]He's probably like, what the fuck's going on in here?
[25:40.98]This will help.
[25:44.15]Flip the card.
[25:46.15]Go on.
[25:47.35]Sir, did you get your ticket yet?
[25:49.23]Shut up, man.
[25:49.65]This is cool.
[25:52.07]Which card?
[25:52.55]Say it.
[25:53.31]This card is your past.
[25:55.25]The lovers.
[25:59.57]This is very good.
[26:03.22]You love your wife very much.
[26:06.00]And she loves you.
[26:10.76]This is the present.
[26:13.54]Go on, turn it.
[26:16.76]The fool.
[26:24.67]This is your problem.
[26:27.85]Somewhere, you have lost your way.
[26:30.91]Don't worry.
[26:31.43]We still have your future.
[26:40.31]Oh my fucking god.
[26:41.29]Here's the death card!
[26:42.71]Did he get it?
[26:46.01]The Alak- the Alakaz- the Ala- what was it?
[26:47.83]The Alchemist?
[26:48.29]Somebody just gave like sixty fucking subs.
[26:52.10]If I liked her, let's just give sixty-nine subs.
[26:58.04]Jesus.
[27:02.28]That's a lot.
[27:05.14]On top of the two plus hundred, I think, that you were responsible for already.
[27:10.14]Thank you.
[27:11.22]That is a shitload of subs.
[27:13.56]Oh.
[27:14.50]Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry.
[27:15.30]I just said there was something going on there.
[27:16.84]I had to do that real quick.
[27:22.47]This is my conversation.
[27:25.81]I mean, I just, I don't, I just want to... Dude, out.
[27:41.18]I'll give you a hundred bucks if you eat that pen.
[27:42.72]Alright, I can't even fucking look at him.
[27:44.90]Let's go.
[27:57.14]How many cars are there?
[27:58.12]I probably shouldn't be holding like a hot coffee in my hand.
[28:03.23]This is like a jump scare game.
[28:05.59]Right?
[28:06.03]Okay.
[28:09.82]Like, this is the worst thing you could possibly do.
[28:11.54]Did I ever tell you guys the idea that I wanted to do, but I never did it because I'm just full of empty ideas?
[28:19.72]I wanted to play a horror game.
[28:20.94]This is back in the YouTube days.
[28:23.52]I wanted to play a horror game and have various annoying things in my lap.
[28:28.43]Like, I have, I think, a popcorn that when I jump scare, the popcorn goes up on me.
[28:31.59]Get, like, a stand-up mixer and be, like, making fucking, like, cookies and batter and shit.
[28:35.95]And then another jump scare, like, oh, the cookies and batter went all over me.
[28:41.22]What am I doing?
[28:41.84]Here, here's my ticket.
[28:48.96]Excuse me.
[28:49.74]Fucking metaghost.
[28:51.86]I'm Canadian!
[28:53.78]Asshole.
[28:58.12]What the hell?

[29:23.66]Kate, where are you?
[29:29.92]Help!
[29:31.00]Help me!
[29:32.05]I can't do it on my own.
[29:33.43]Is there blood?
[29:37.91]Blood on the train.
[29:40.79]Hold on, this is important.
[29:41.75]I gotta get ready for this.
[30:02.74]Okay, well... I'm gonna go talk to security.
[30:07.73]Because...
[30:11.93]We're just happening back there Can I do anything with this stuff?
[30:25.06]Alright, I'll go in Bar tender joke.
[30:33.55]Hey anybody need anything?
[30:38.41]Alright, let's go in.
[30:39.75]Here we go.
[30:40.39]Scary horror game.
[30:43.71]I said I was going to play it, and I'm like, I'm pumped up.
[30:45.80]I'm hyped.
[30:46.18]My god, help!
[31:06.19]Somebody help!
[31:06.53]Oh, perfect.
[31:07.87]Shoot it!
[31:08.95]Shoot it!
[31:18.02]Shoot it!
[31:18.86]Oh shit!
[31:26.72]It's Scorpion in the $12 skin!
[31:29.61]Get the fuck out quick!
[31:30.67]That guy's got money!
[31:31.75]Get out of here!
[31:55.01]That's how tacked on these achievements are.
[31:56.31]That achievement was just called the train.
[32:01.37]I didn't fucking do anything.
[32:03.87]The train.
[32:05.86]I got 10 points.
[32:13.12]Hmm.
[32:14.34]Did the train derail?
[32:17.12]Oh, God.
[32:17.94]What about Kate?
[32:21.02]Escape from the train.
[32:22.26]I get up right there.
[32:23.34]Bleeding in what?
[32:45.65]Where are you?
[32:47.73]Restricted... Restricted auto.
[32:49.65]There are some situations where you won't be able to auto-move.
[32:52.17]Okay.
[32:55.04]Where is this person?
[32:55.86]Oh, I found the exit.
[32:59.70]Do I have to jump?
[33:08.35]God, I really shouldn't be drunk doing this.
[33:10.27]Mm-hmm.
[33:10.55]I knew it.
[33:22.42]Stay balanced?
[33:27.12]How is that not balanced?
[33:37.57]That was... I was doing the pencil.
[33:45.51]Do I have to put weight down on my right foot?
[33:47.69]Stay balanced.
[33:52.51]It's the train.
[33:56.05]Okay, I gotta go left.
[34:08.97]Why can't I do auto-movement?
[34:12.15]Okay, balance.
[34:13.13]Stay to the left.
[34:21.71]Good.
[34:24.63]Alright, let's go.
[34:26.83]Should I go try to get the secret that's over here on the left?
[34:42.56]There's no secret over here.
[34:49.92]This shit's gonna make me sick.
[34:52.10]Alright, now where?
[35:01.03]I'm good, I'm good.
[35:07.36]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[35:11.90]Okay.
[35:20.35]He walked backwards off the train.
[35:38.61]He walked backwards.
[35:39.60]I put my foot forward.
[35:40.44]You saw it.
[35:41.50]I walked fucking forward.
[35:44.04]Why can't you even walk backwards?
[35:50.36]Oh no, I got Luigi.
[35:51.32]How do I run?
[36:11.65]The whole game that you're supposed to go, like, put your foot forward to automatically move, now I have to all of a sudden run?
[36:22.29]Alright.
[36:23.73]This is how you move the whole game.
[36:25.13]Now fucking sprint, dude, hurry!
[36:26.99]Gotta move it.
[36:27.97]The train's not gonna hold.
[36:29.85]This man is just sitting on the top of the hill.
[36:58.65]It's backwards, so you know.
[36:59.87]Fuck.
[37:00.13]Achievement.
[37:00.63]Run for it.
[37:01.67]No?
[37:28.15]You're just standing very close to the fire.
[37:29.69]Signal.
[37:33.19]No, why would you throw the phone?
[37:34.98]People always do that in fucking movies and TV shows.
[37:37.48]What if it works?
[37:39.06]What if you get a signal from over here?
[37:40.48]Get any closer, you're gonna get burned.
[37:41.96]Like, a hundred feet that way.
[37:43.42]We just survived a fucking train crash.
[37:46.41]We're lost in the middle of nowhere in a fucking cave.
[37:49.35]You relax.
[37:50.87]Somebody's going to come for us!
[37:52.32]I mean, at least, like, take pictures of shit on your phone.
[37:56.30]Like, document a trail so they can figure out, like, what happened.
[38:01.40]And then, once you document the whole trail, throw it as fucking far as you can.
[38:05.48]And it'll get washed up and somebody will decipher the photos and find you.
[38:08.49]What the hell are these guys talking about?
[38:09.87]They say this land is... Blastamat.
[38:13.83]It's Romanian for cursed.
[38:15.99]He thinks it's dangerous to go out there at night.
[38:19.44]How did you know?
[38:21.74]I'm studying foreign languages.
[38:23.94]Romanian is one of them.
[38:25.66]Great.
[38:26.90]Derailed into a cursed forest.
[38:28.78]This keeps getting better and better.
[38:32.00]I thought that was the person in the fire.
[38:36.34]Hey, is this maybe another way out?
[38:39.62]I thought it was the person in the fire.
[38:41.12]I thought that guy was on fire.
[38:44.58]Oh shit, I got too close.
[38:47.60]Let me lead the way.
[38:53.19]So we've got the old man, the train conductor, the badass, the college educated, the journalist.
[39:08.22]There's one more.
[39:13.80]There's one more.
[39:24.81]I can't, I physically cannot see this.
[39:26.33]It's so blurry, but from back here.
[39:30.13]The funny guy.
[39:31.07]Wait, is that me?
[39:31.57]Are we supposed to go over here?
[39:40.07]Is everyone alright?
[39:46.52]Super.
[39:47.90]Uh, train conductor's gone.
[39:55.95]Already.
[39:56.89]And then, okay, now we've got some train conductors.
[39:59.53]We don't care, apparently.
[40:04.05]Nobody is upset about the fact that the train conductor just literally got sucked underneath by a giant alligator.
[40:29.38]What's on me?
[40:30.56]I'm coming in leeches?
[40:31.76]Hold on, I can't do that right now.
[40:43.22]Alright, if I just stood there, would everybody have just gotten all their blood drained?
[40:52.99]By the way, you cannot swat off leeches.
[41:01.48]Doesn't work like that.
[41:02.14]Alright, he's next to go.
[41:05.72]I think... I think... I think this guy is next to go.
[41:37.07]See, he's first.
[41:44.13]No, no, go forward.
[41:46.49]Just auto.
[41:55.44]Come on, I'm always the last person!
[42:05.23]What did you guys see?
[42:11.03]Is that a person right here?
[42:15.00]Oh, it's the fortune teller.
[42:17.72]Okay.
[42:30.82]I want somebody else to do their fortune, which is a bunch of gold.
[42:34.11]Oh, it's the fortune card.
[42:35.15]It's the gold card.
[42:36.47]You're going to make a lot of money.
[42:38.25]They're like, oh, cool.
[42:41.03]They get on the fucking helicopter at the end and leave.
[42:47.20]What the hell is going on?
[42:48.69]Where is the Romany woman?
[42:52.93]What are you talking about?
[42:55.00]It's just me and the Ruski twins.
[42:57.02]Well, we saw someone.
[42:58.94]She has to be here.
[43:00.24]Maybe she went down there.
[43:03.34]Down in the creepy fucking basement basement?
[43:05.66]Good luck with that.
[43:17.31]Somebody will come.
[43:18.43]I just know it.
[43:19.67]Alright, let's talk.
[43:21.49]Don't punch guy in head.
[43:23.31]I saw it interact.
[43:26.60]Well, now that you made it seem like... Now that you gave me an opportunity.
[43:30.50]Like, I kind of have to know.
[43:33.44]Shit, traveling through Europe seemed like such a good idea.
[43:40.52]No, you can't.
[43:42.26]You cannot.
[43:43.45]I know everybody wanted me to try, so I did.
[43:50.53]So fortune teller went down here.
[43:57.80]That's what I'm understanding, right?
[44:15.89]Just do it for me.
[44:16.77]I don't want to walk down this.
[44:23.25]What's in here?
[44:28.17]Is a body in here?
[44:32.16]Who is this?
[44:50.57]What happened?
[44:51.51]Is this not working?
[44:52.53]Do I need a weapon or something?
[45:07.45]I did it!
[45:07.97]Alright, so... That doesn't count.
[45:14.23]That negates each other.
[45:16.43]Oh god, just go.
[45:20.79]How many times do I have to punch something in the face?
[45:22.85]Is there a dodge mechanic that I didn't see?
[45:31.77]I'll handle this.
[45:33.51]Got it.
[45:34.23]Alright, anything else in here?
[45:47.15]Health potion?
[45:50.02]Okay, let's go.
[45:50.60]Here comes the jump scare.
[45:53.88]Here it comes.
[45:54.32]Just want to make sure I get everything in the way.
[45:57.20]Let's go.
[46:00.66]Got it.
[46:05.64]Did you just lock me in here?
[46:09.51]What is wrong with you?
[46:18.27]Do you block attacks?
[46:19.40]How do you block?
[46:26.04]I'm just gonna go for it.
[46:35.89]Is this even doing anything?
[46:37.87]Why is it still fighting?
[46:58.31]I... I... You get rid of the brain, you get rid of the head, and it's gone.
[47:03.65]What?
[47:03.89]Oh god!
[47:15.62]Did that one just move?
[47:20.16]The brain is in their legs.
[47:21.82]I didn't even get the fucking knife.
[47:25.24]No, I'm getting out of this.
[47:26.48]I'm fucking winning this.
[47:32.24]No, we're not neck- we're not going to the next one.
[47:34.58]I have to kill these three zombies.
[47:36.28]Okay, here we go.
[47:45.73]Here we go, let's do it.
[47:52.82]Get out here.
[48:23.19]Open the door.
[48:26.80]Out.
[48:26.98]Forward.
[48:28.94]Just go forward.
[48:29.84]Watch out, watch out.
[48:30.52]They're gonna come up, come up.
[48:45.19]This is fucking ridiculous, man.
[48:48.24]I'm just gonna...
[49:21.49]Open the door, quick!
[49:22.19]Alright, out, out, out, out, out.
[49:24.91]We're good, right?
[49:25.29]There's someone from behind me.
[49:33.67]What happened?
[49:34.27]Escape the-
[49:53.56]Oh, he's got acid!
[49:59.81]How do I get out of here?
[50:01.46]Iron pipe?
[50:02.04]Give me that!
[50:26.66]Just go.
[50:27.56]You can kick your enemies.
[50:35.28]What are you... What the fuck?
[51:08.66]I'm not done yet.
[51:09.72]Not yet.
[51:10.28]I gotta get out of the cemetery first.
[51:12.76]Here we go.
[51:13.24]I'm getting out of here.
[51:20.30]What are you doing?
[51:21.55]Go forward.
[51:25.31]Why am I moving backwards?
[51:28.19]This is... I need that pipe.
[51:52.48]What the fuck, man?
[51:53.90]Why is there so much acid?
[52:00.14]Go for it!
[52:02.02]I don't even care.
[52:04.62]Alright, I'm just gonna kill this thing.
[52:06.02]I'm not gonna do the tutorial kick.
[52:09.84]Now focus on the person over that way.
[52:12.34]They're this way, turn.
[52:42.81]Put your hands up!
[52:47.01]Alright, I told you I couldn't fucking get through this.
[52:51.99]Watch out.
[52:52.70]Is it a chest?
[53:00.10]Bunch of chests.
[53:01.86]How do I open these?
[53:09.47]Got it?
[53:14.28]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
[53:26.01]Oh shit, this is not good.
[53:31.77]PUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!
[53:49.37]No!
[53:50.05]I have to get out of here.
[54:02.14]I have to get out of this.
[54:03.02]I have to.
[54:33.91]I still am moving backwards for some dumb reason.
[54:38.63]Hey, shit.
[54:39.25]Hey, shit.
[54:40.25]Shit.
[54:40.59]Get the machete.
[54:41.53]What?
[54:44.28]Hey, shit.
[54:45.10]Get the machete.
[54:45.84]What do you mean, hey, shit?
[54:49.12]Where's the machete?
[54:52.78]Hey, shit.
[54:53.74]Get the machete.
[54:57.24]I don't see a machete.
[55:01.57]Hey, shit.
[55:07.23]Lower the difficulty.
[55:09.75]Just too late.
[55:10.33]I'm going for it.
[55:11.03]I can do it.
[55:14.35]Alright.
[55:14.83]I'm gonna make it.
[55:15.29]Here we go.
[55:16.67]Fight.
[55:17.13]Just kill them.
[55:23.18]Hands up.
[55:30.04]Why are you backing up?
[55:32.48]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[56:10.62]Where is it?
[56:10.94]Is it over here?
[56:21.65]I don't- I don't see a Crescetti.
[56:23.01]What's that?
[56:24.49]Iron pipe.
[56:24.97]I got two pipes now.
[56:25.69]I got two- both hands?
[56:45.52]Ow, let's go.
[56:51.10]Alright, this is where I died last time.
[56:53.88]Hey, shit!
[57:00.77]Why are my hands not up?! !
[57:19.80]Could it be that I'm delirious from fatigue?
[57:23.00]Or... or am I dreaming this?
[57:25.20]The corpse... just suddenly came back to life.
[57:31.14]It could be cold by now.
[57:33.33]How am I to describe them?
[57:35.25]I'm wondering what the corpse is made of, divine machine.
[57:39.63]How'd he kill this guy?
[57:40.83]Get rid of the arm.
[57:43.79]He cut his hand off!
[57:46.84]Did I win?
[58:08.04]Oh my god, oh my god!
[58:09.74]What the fuck?!
[58:11.74]Put your fucking hands up over this guy!
[58:28.96]Please!
[58:34.86]Still, still, still, still, still, still, still!
[58:37.19]Where is he?
[58:42.78]Where?
[58:43.56]Where?
[58:44.08]Where's my weapon?
[58:44.92]I can't see.
[58:46.30]Knife arm.
[58:50.81]Get it.
[59:03.40]Can I please be done with this?
[59:15.81]Oh, thank God!
[59:17.77]No!
[59:18.41]No!
[59:19.09]Stop!
[59:24.52]Jesus.
[59:26.98]No!
[59:31.36]Okay, that was fucking brutal.
[59:57.94]It's doing a lot of good Arnold noises there.
[60:10.02]He looks like a fucking jester.
[60:11.48]I saw him at your place.
[60:24.67]Oh, Shia!
[60:25.09]Uh-oh, it's the mad doctor.
[60:26.87]That guy had pretty weak arms.
[60:29.01]That was like... He was doing like a little tap.
[60:31.61]I see.
[60:56.65]What is this for?
[60:59.19]Right?
[60:59.51]They always have like the crazy fucking butcher, doctor, psycho in all these things.
[61:03.73]What are you doing this for?
[61:05.19]Is someone going to answer that?
[61:12.10]Hello?
[61:14.38]Ah, sweetheart.
[61:15.96]That wasn't an experiment.
[61:18.92]He just put an axe in that person's head.
[61:20.74]That was not like a... Oh, and I'm doing a test on the globulation of human skulls.
[61:27.69]There's always fucked up music in the background.
[61:32.70]Why can't there be like a top ten song here?
[61:38.66]He waves first!
[61:57.12]Hey, instead of waving, just get it done.
[61:58.76]Like, oh, hey, I'm about to save your life.
[62:00.78]Hey, just remember me, right?
[62:02.35]I'm the fucking old guy.
[62:04.15]We've got to hurry.
[62:06.67]This place is crazy.
[62:10.05]Let's get out of here.
[62:15.89]Wait.
[62:16.27]Wait.
[62:16.51]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[62:17.32]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[62:17.96]Put it down.
[62:18.28]Put it down.
[62:19.12]I want to go back in there.
[62:20.18]Probably it's like an item.
[62:22.38]Watch out.
[62:26.70]Is there like a saw or an axe or something?
[62:30.25]You gotta have something in here, right?
[62:34.71]Nothing?
[62:37.79]God damn it.
[62:39.07]Fine.
[62:46.22]Take the hand.
[62:46.94]What do you mean take the hand?
[62:48.02]I can't take the fucking hand.
[62:53.13]I'm very indecisive, old man.
[62:54.59]I'm sorry.
[63:02.98]You can't.
[63:03.46]You can't.
[63:03.84]Guys, you can't.
[63:04.44]Alright, where to now?
[63:13.06]Let's let the game tell us.
[63:21.31]Monsters in here?
[63:21.95]Does he have a weapon?
[63:33.89]I'm alright, I'll be fine.
[63:35.03]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming!
[63:47.60]Let me help you down.
[63:49.90]Was this person just saying that?
[64:00.05]No, blue tunnel.
[64:05.57]Alright, I just... I activate something.
[64:17.73]Oops.
[64:18.35]I tried... You're trying to save me, man.
[64:22.13]I'm just trying to save you.
[64:32.38]I'm surprised that you could actually do that.
[64:37.06]No, no, don't go back in this room.
[64:38.44]I don't need to be in there.
[64:39.39]No.
[64:39.87]I want the old man to go in there first.
[64:49.20]No weapons.
[64:49.70]Just go.
[65:09.15]Okay, what if I don't... No.
[65:13.96]Is it safe to go over there?
[65:23.42]I can't, okay.
[65:23.86]So what do I do now?
[65:24.82]Reach for the key?
[65:42.33]Alright, I got the key.
[65:45.07]Key for unlocking a closed door.
[65:46.79]No shit.
[65:54.20]Alright.
[66:00.20]I hear another person.
[66:07.66]Device over here.
[66:09.77]What's this do?
[66:18.05]Alright, should I go through the hole?
[66:21.03]There is a hole right there.
[66:22.32]No, I can't even go through it.
[66:40.05]A lot of walking.
[66:40.85]There's gotta be something in here.
[66:46.47]There's gotta be another person in here.
[66:54.10]I don't know, downstairs?
[66:55.13]This is a giant hallway.
[67:13.87]It's fresh.
[67:15.98]Could be another survivor.
[67:17.34]Oh, Jesus.
[67:19.86]I didn't even get...
[67:23.46]You don't even get to fucking have one minute with any NPCs.
[67:31.88]Every single NPC is gone in less than a minute.
[67:37.70]I want to get closer to feel the fucking wind on my face.
[67:56.78]Oh, that's close.
[68:07.53]The tip of my nose is gone.
[68:10.27]Ugh.
[68:22.70]Really?
[68:35.67]There's a lot of ways you can die in this game.
[68:45.94]Alright, survival level, let's go.
[68:53.36]Do I have to fight the doctor?
[68:54.82]I probably am.
[69:02.89]Alright, I'm gonna have to fight.
[69:04.60]This is the worst part about this game, is the actual fighting.
[69:10.26]Everything else is kinda cool, but the fighting is the worst.
[69:16.83]Victor Fleischer, my quarry.
[69:19.05]A scholar hailing from Ingolstadt.
[69:21.73]An authority in medicine, science, philosophy, history, and more besides.
[69:26.60]The purportedly brilliant man vanished without warning, according to my client.
[69:30.88]I'm curiously attracted to him.
[69:32.98]While not related, I feel to have an urgent need to have him found.
[69:38.18]But sympathy serves no purpose to an investigator.
[69:40.34]It only clouds judgment.
[69:44.23]Besides, she played generously with me.
[69:46.15]Can I reach?
[69:47.93]No.
[69:48.03]Turn this way.
[70:01.24]Oh, alright.
[70:05.02]What's that?
[70:06.43]Shlaw's?
[70:07.43]Shlow's?
[70:08.31]Scalpel.
[70:13.67]A surgical scalpel to be hurled at enemies.
[70:16.37]That's throwing knives?
[70:17.53]Alright, easy.
[70:31.82]Straight down here.
[70:37.83]What's the rhyme or reason for this?
[70:38.89]I just throw them at their heads or something?
[70:50.28]Alright, this is- I love these.
[70:53.40]You don't even have to fight anything, it's great.
[71:01.24]I'm just gonna get to the first boss.
[71:04.33]When I get to the first boss, we'll go to the next one.
[71:07.15]But I gotta get to the first boss.
[71:08.75]Hands up.
[71:11.81]Put your hands up.
[71:20.87]Put your hands up.
[71:21.51]Put your hands up.
[71:22.55]Put your hands up.
[71:25.11]Put your hands up.
[71:25.65]I don't know why you're not putting them up.
[71:33.56]Who the fuck is she?
[71:35.10]God damn it.
[71:41.22]Okay.
[71:42.15]Download the hatch.
[71:49.43]What?
[71:49.69]I- I- Yeah, it's them.
[71:51.29]Yeah!
[71:53.73]First boss is gonna be the doctor.
[72:00.07]I'm gonna kill the doctor.
[72:05.23]Who made this game?
[72:22.77]What company did this?
[72:23.73]I forgot you can't ask that question.
[72:44.97]Alright, who's next?
[72:48.33]There's somebody behind me!
[72:51.61]Somebody's in a fucking stall!
[73:03.43]What?
[73:05.01]Go into the... You can splash the toilet?
[73:08.95]Block?
[73:09.29]Pick up?
[73:09.67]Why would I put my hands in here?
[73:17.54]Alright, I'm glad I turned to look in here because there's no way I would have ever gone over there.
[73:23.38]I would have never in a million years ever opened that.
[73:28.27]And I would have freaked out.
[73:29.51]I would have been like, this game is fucking stupid.
[73:33.89]I mean, this game is stupid.
[73:35.27]But I would have been even more stupid.
[73:46.10]It's not bad, though.
[73:49.45]It really isn't.
[73:53.22]It's not the worst game I've ever played.
[73:57.00]I mean, it's up there in the top like probably top like 50 worst games I've ever played, but it's not the top 10 worst games I've ever played.
[74:04.28]Being in the top like 50 worst game ever means you're like probably like a, I don't know, like a five and a half, six.
[74:13.13]Now that's not even fair.
[74:14.31]I wouldn't put this in the top 50 worst games ever.
[74:19.28]I put this in, like, the top.
[74:20.38]Anyway.
[74:20.64]Oh.
[74:21.22]Sorry.
[74:22.22]I gotta be quiet.
[74:28.24]There's no way I'm gonna get through this.
[74:41.07]Oh my god.
[74:41.85]I just died.
[74:44.65]Okay.
[74:44.87]So... I need to go across...
[75:09.46]Focus!
[75:09.88]Focus on this!
[75:10.52]Focus!
[75:11.12]Focus before he spits on you!
[75:18.05]What the fuck?
[75:20.47]What?
[75:21.39]No, go forward.
[75:25.75]Alright, who's next?
[75:28.92]Is that it?
[75:33.90]Okay.
[75:35.06]Let's go.
[75:37.34]Saw, saw, saw, saw.
[75:38.82]No, I'm not just gonna get hit by the saw.
[75:41.92]I made it through already.
[75:48.03]I can't get killed by every single trap in the whole game, okay?
[75:53.19]We gotta put our foot down somewhere.
[76:30.22]Just punch him in the chest.
[76:33.90]Ah, I got him.
[76:52.59]Wait, what is that?
[77:07.65]What's that thing?
[77:12.79]Is somebody trying to get my attention?
[77:15.63]Is somebody standing right here?
[77:17.77]Did you throw that all the way from down there?
[77:21.31]Holy shit man, that's pretty impressive.
[77:32.31]Get the knife!
[77:34.39]Get the knife!
[77:36.07]Shit.
[77:42.60]Wait, hold on.
[77:52.76]Are you going over there to fight the guy that just spit at you?
[78:04.78]Kill that one in the middle.
[78:16.53]I gotta get... Just thread it in.
[78:22.73]Where's the knife?
[78:31.44]God damn it!
[78:32.06]Go back, back, back, back, back, back, back!
[78:34.36]No, what are you doing?
[78:35.48]Stop!
[78:36.92]What am I doing?
[78:38.34]I'm not doing this.
[78:40.79]I'm not doing this at all.
[78:43.19]He just helped me get through.
[78:44.55]Thank you, sir.
[78:45.49]Open the door, open the door, open the door, open the door.
[78:59.20]Do I need a key?
[79:09.77]Oh, but... Okay, no, that was me.
[79:13.35]Okay.
[79:14.37]I need to turn the power on.
[79:15.89]Of course I do.
[79:16.83]There's gotta be something in here I can use.
[79:18.25]In this little, uh, office area?
[79:24.68]A knife or a board or a plank or a...
[79:27.70]Something, a piece of wood.
[79:30.68]A 2x4.
[79:31.14]Or a... What the hell is in here?
[79:38.66]Have I been down here?
[79:39.40]I'm just checking them.
[79:52.30]Volatile test tube.
[79:54.12]They're gonna come alive.
[79:54.90]I gotta get something in this room right now.
[80:02.30]Okay, filled with unstable chemicals.
[80:07.18]What's that?
[80:07.70]Test tube?
[80:08.08]Okay, I've got like an explosion or something.
[80:13.73]Not bad.
[80:15.61]What are you saying?
[80:26.18]What are you saying?
[80:28.50]Hey, shit!
[80:29.83]Tape!
[80:30.23]Tape!
[80:30.47]We don't need to listen to the tape.
[80:32.55]That's not a problem.
[80:44.15]I could turn the power on, and then get back up there and open that door.
[80:47.48]And then throw acid in the doctor's face.
[80:54.86]Hold on.
[80:56.18]More test tubes.
[80:57.02]Give me them.
[80:58.78]I'll have 21.
[80:59.88]Here's the generator.
[81:03.97]So this is where this game is going to become stupid, because I'm going to turn the generator on, and then 20 enemies are going to spawn.
[81:12.63]Get ready for that.
[81:20.49]Okay, power's up and running.
[81:22.59]Maybe that door upstairs is open now.
[81:26.50]Yeah.
[81:26.64]Of course.
[81:28.40]And now they're electrified.
[81:30.22]I just electrified them.
[81:31.28]Is that from steroid arms?
[81:41.63]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[81:42.71]Give me that.
[81:45.09]I'm gonna wait for them to come down here.
[81:48.29]Where is this other one?
[81:51.37]No, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[81:52.45]Don't stay there.
[82:07.59]Oh, no.
[82:09.57]I can't go that way.
[82:14.08]No, I want the knife bomb.
[82:16.42]Give me the knife.
[82:17.32]Stop moving.
[82:19.22]Okay, I can't go that way.
[82:27.41]Break your bones.
[82:28.27]Move bones.
[82:38.99]Can I fit in here?
[82:52.97]Can I fucking kill this guy?
[83:05.66]There are spikes behind me, by the way.
[83:10.48]I don't want to walk forward.
[83:11.94]What the fuck?
[83:13.02]Oh my god.
[83:26.85]Did somebody just spit on me?
[83:53.35]I'm gonna go backwards.
[83:54.05]There's something on the ground right here, on my right.
[84:07.35]Ah!
[84:08.91]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[84:16.80]I'm just scraping my back.
[84:19.80]Okay.
[84:26.73]Forward!
[84:27.49]Forward!
[84:33.82]I know they're behind me, I'm trying to go forward!
[84:45.84]Thank god.
[84:46.42]I have to kill the first boss, I refuse to go next until the first boss is dead.
[85:02.60]Stop!
[85:03.30]Back up.
[85:03.88]Give me the thing on the ground, right here.
[85:09.08]Where is it?
[85:11.83]Knife?
[85:12.77]Oh my god, game.
[85:26.88]Alright, I want to pick up the thing on the ground.
[85:30.13]Oh my god, the millions of dollars that this took to make.
[85:59.72]Pick it up, now!
[86:10.05]Okay, I'm good.
[86:10.77]Let's go.
[86:11.71]End of the hall.
[86:17.63]That's a spit guy.
[86:18.33]Spit, spit, spit.
[86:31.97]Don't bump into that.
[86:33.53]Don't bump a fucking cannon still!
[86:58.34]Get me the fuck out of this place.
[87:00.16]Seems to be closed off.
[87:03.65]Chainsaw?
[87:09.44]Alright, I'm going to get the chainsaw.
[87:10.72]Wait, what's that?
[87:13.32]What is this thing?
[87:15.56]There's a thing on the wall.
[87:17.92]Can I do that?
[87:18.42]No?
[87:22.94]Where's the chainsaw?
[87:29.55]What is that?
[87:30.55]Bloody chainsaw?
[87:32.87]Ooh, wow, you're not lying!
[87:34.89]I thought that was a gas can.
[87:44.30]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[87:56.61]Alright.
[88:00.57]How do I turn it on?
[88:13.67]This thing sucks, get me out of this!
[88:15.99]Climb up!
[88:16.87]Up!
[88:17.67]Climb!
[88:24.24]Okay, then... Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what do I do?
[88:35.18]I would love it if you would walk forward.
[88:49.05]Oh shit!
[88:50.85]No!
[88:51.99]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[88:53.17]Okay, there's another one right here, right?
[89:12.50]This is a thing, it's a game, I knew it!
[89:14.40]I knew it, that's why I was waiting.
[89:17.05]Okay, now, this is where we turn it on and we just drag it across the screen and hit everybody here.
[89:23.06]Okay?
[89:24.16]That's what's gonna happen.
[89:24.86]Alright?
[89:25.80]Are we aware of that?
[89:26.84]We are?
[89:27.38]Good.
[89:34.16]There's so many people in this room.
[89:36.82]How am I supposed to do this?
[89:41.58]These guys have, like, electro-zapper things.
[89:51.27]This guy ain't doing shit over here, but he's freaking me out.
[90:02.41]What?
[90:05.15]Where?
[90:05.83]What happened?
[90:06.23]I think I have to run for it.
[90:12.06]Straight through there, right?
[90:16.38]I can't read what you guys are saying.
[90:17.46]You're probably giving me some really good advice right now, but I can't see it.
[90:23.82]God dammit.
[90:27.54]They're on like this interval.
[90:28.74]I'm gonna have to squawk.
[90:38.88]Hey!
[90:39.14]Get it, get it, get it, get it!
[91:00.85]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[91:02.50]Easy.
[91:09.00]What's he doing?
[91:26.07]Why do I have to be so drunk?
[91:34.31]He's gonna kill me with that thing.
[91:35.37]It hurts, it still- I gotta move.
[91:43.23]Oh my god!
[91:55.46]Oh my god!
[92:06.54]Excuse me, excuse me.
[92:09.81]Excuse me.
[92:10.39]Oh, this got in my eye.
[92:23.80]I'm lying.
[92:26.30]Here comes the first boss.
[92:33.05]Fish, anybody got a fish comment?
[92:35.98]The movement's fucked up because it... What are you talking about?
[92:39.29]Escape with your life.
[92:44.43]What's that?
[92:45.99]Vase.
[92:49.14]Why would I want to use this as a weapon?
[92:58.88]Alright, where's the doctor?
[92:59.76]Let me smash this man's head.
[93:05.51]Let me just sneak up behind the doctor and bash him with this thing.
[93:08.41]Uh, so those can explode.
[93:11.88]Sure thing!
[93:40.86]I'm just gonna walk by it.
[93:43.84]Alright, just get over there.
[93:52.17]I'm just walking.
[93:53.25]I don't even care.
[93:53.93]There's no points, you don't level up.
[94:07.09]I don't want to hit the thing.
[94:10.97]there's no level up system there's no way who cares just trying to get around them there are points you do level up that's horseshit no they aren't there are not
[94:42.94]Somebody get me in one of those things.
[94:48.69]What are you doing?
[94:56.55]This game kind of reminds me of... If House of the Dead fell down the stairs.
[95:00.89]What is he talking about?
[95:17.95]Here it goes.
[95:18.27]You're gonna get mad at one of these.
[95:19.71]Oh no, watch out!
[95:26.43]No, alright.
[95:27.07]Well, no trope.
[95:39.73]Let's go.
[95:40.25]Here we go.
[95:41.01]This is it.
[95:42.20]This is the reason why I've been playing for this long.
[95:48.15]Sorry.
[95:49.17]It's you.
[95:51.01]Thank God.
[95:52.75]You're alive.
[95:54.25]You've got to cry.
[95:55.63]Just get right by her face.
[95:56.99]Alright, well, remember, how long has she been on screen for?
[96:01.42]One minute?
[96:01.78]Two minutes?
[96:04.02]We are at that threshold where she's going to get thrown off the bridge here.
[96:20.71]The bad guy's just gonna crawl up and just put both of his hands like this and just squirt at him.
[96:24.65]Here we go.
[96:28.85]Uh, Piano's gonna fall.
[96:57.97]And like a snake.
[96:59.64]Yup.
[96:59.92]Right through the chest.
[97:02.42]Just like... This guy's name isn't Ernest.
[97:28.79]His name's fucking Ernest.
[97:33.03]That's not scary.
[97:34.43]That's not scary at all.
[97:35.83]Oh, you are pretty stupid.
[98:00.33]Oh, hold on.
[98:01.01]Be careful.
[98:01.51]He's going to turn around.
[98:04.99]Quick.
[98:06.39]Take the phone.
[98:10.03]Put your phone on silent.
[98:25.28]Where are they?
[98:25.64]Can I move?
[98:33.71]I guess.
[98:42.31]Where'd she go?
[98:46.03]No, go this way.
[98:54.25]Uh, I think you're gonna- you went over here?
[99:00.39]There you are, okay.
[99:05.62]Fucking easy.
[99:06.14]So what do we do now?
[99:14.81]Knife?
[99:15.01]I told you.
[99:16.79]Hand.
[99:16.91]I knew it!
[99:17.19]Squish!
[99:37.81]Not even two minutes!
[99:39.56]Not even two minutes on screen!
[99:41.44]Count it!
[99:57.03]Give me that.
[100:09.29]No, let him bite me.
[100:11.09]Come on.
[100:13.13]I can fucking take it.
[100:14.05]One more.
[100:18.71]Alright, alright, alright, I've had enough.
[100:23.83]What's in there?
[100:26.11]No.
[100:26.37]Just a bunch of gross shit.
[100:33.83]That corpse is rather suspicious.
[100:36.68]It sure is.
[100:37.86]I should probably kill it now.
[100:50.76]Am I going... digging around in here?
[100:54.13]I don't wanna do that.
[100:56.63]Ugh!
[101:02.19]Yeah, well... I guess it turns out you just had gas.
[101:06.54]Huh.
[101:08.84]Ancient key.
[101:15.96]Key for unlocking a clue?
[101:19.32]Somebody's next to me?
[101:20.20]Somebody's around here and I... Oh shit!
[101:25.80]Why are my hands not in the air?
[101:32.97]This video game...
[101:35.27]Just got bumped up to top 50 worst games.
[101:41.81]It happened on stream.
[101:42.96]I'm gonna have a huge red mark on my head right here.
[102:00.44]Alright, here we go.
[102:02.62]Yeah.
[102:02.86]Get in there, dig in there, get the key.
[102:09.72]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[102:10.12]I'm gonna take my hand out.
[102:31.09]Pick up the key.
[102:37.70]I'm not leaving until I do.
[103:00.45]Oh, what is that?
[103:01.07]A meat hammer.
[103:03.35]Nice.
[103:17.71]Alright, easy.
[103:18.77]I don't want that vase.
[103:26.19]I don't need it.
[103:29.91]I got an ancient key for the ancient door.
[103:32.61]No good.
[103:33.37]It won't budge.
[103:34.92]What is it?
[103:42.00]The valve?
[103:46.12]Ancient door for the ancient key?
[103:49.65]There it is.
[103:50.79]Okay.
[103:59.74]He's not actually going to beat this whole game, is he?
[104:02.52]No, I don't think he will.
[104:03.64]I mean, sometimes he does that, but I mean, this is just, I don't think even him, I don't think he would even want to do this.
[104:11.39]It is Kinect Horror Night, though, so don't be surprised if he does.
[104:14.30]Yeah, I guess it's true.
[104:46.90]I can't get up.
[104:48.04]I got through my backup going down that fast.
[104:52.82]I can't.
[104:56.33]I gotta go.
[104:57.99]Just kidding.
[104:59.17]I don't have to start all the way back, do I?
[105:01.39]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[105:04.75]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[105:05.59]I don't want to do this again.
[105:06.39]I'm about to turn it off.
[105:07.33]I'm about to.
[105:08.30]I'm fighting it.
[105:09.08]I'm fighting the urge to turn it off.
[105:11.06]I'm fighting it.
[105:16.74]Do it.
[105:17.04]Do it.
[105:17.50]Do it.
[105:21.80]Oh, I want it so bad.
[105:22.56]Hold on.
[105:23.12]I want it so bad.
[105:24.40]I want it so bad.
[105:25.16]Okay, I'm going to do it.
[105:27.01]I'm not going to think about it.
[105:29.33]I'm just going to turn it off.
[105:33.55]Last try, last attempt, this final attempt.
[105:35.83]No matter what happens, if I don't lose again, it's over.
[105:38.39]I'm moving on to the other one.
[105:39.61]The other one's called Hunt.
[105:53.71]Key, fight the people, walk down the hall, open the door.
[105:56.88]Here we go, turn, check it out.
[105:59.40]Got my hands up already.
[106:09.69]I'm good.
[106:10.35]I saw.
[106:10.97]I want that.
[106:11.35]No, I don't.
[106:11.77]Just keep this.
[106:12.19]Who cares?
[106:12.77]Go.
[106:13.41]It's all the same item.
[106:14.15]Every item is the same item.
[106:29.37]Here we go.
[106:33.04]Same deal.
[106:33.90]Get the fire poker.
[106:34.78]I will take that.
[106:35.30]That's an extra, like, 0% damage.
[106:38.41]Done.
[106:38.81]Good.
[106:39.23]Done.
[106:39.65]Let's go.
[107:02.39]Now what?
[107:02.65]Can I stand up?
[107:03.05]Do I have to duck again?
[107:08.29]Why am I going this way?
[107:08.99]What are you doing?
[107:10.65]What are you doing?
[107:11.11]What are you doing?
[107:12.70]Why is the auto thing going the other way?
[107:28.48]Alright, come on.
[107:29.58]No more deaths.
[107:31.68]I just have to kill the guy.
[107:32.82]I just have to get rid of the guy.
[107:37.90]Whoa, the audience turns on me.
[107:41.60]What the fuck?
[107:46.87]You go through the wall?
[107:52.25]No, come on.
[107:52.81]I want to finish this.
[107:53.67]Don't do this.
[107:54.26]I want to... It's just moving on its own, no?
[107:56.44]Okay, it's not good.
[107:57.62]I'm turning it off.
[108:11.33]No it's not, it's not time to turn it off yet.
[108:14.57]Alright, quick, go this way and touch the thing.
[108:16.63]Did I already do this?
[108:19.31]I don't even remember.
[108:20.51]Did I turn the valve already?
[108:22.97]Did I?
[108:23.29]Oh my god, yes, yes.
[108:27.20]Did I turn it already?
[108:28.56]Yes.
[108:28.80]Run, okay I did.
[108:52.35]Don't ever buy this
[109:23.54]If you go like this, you don't have your fucking hands up.
[109:26.60]Sometimes it works, but sometimes it just doesn't if you just stand there.
[109:31.10]Go like this instead.
[109:33.08]You're like, the other two guys will slash you.
[109:36.67]Holy shit.
[109:39.69]Shred it?
[109:40.13]Alright.
[109:46.05]Fine.
[109:47.56]Fine.
[109:51.18]Give me this fucking thing.
[110:01.47]Let's shred it.
[110:15.97]Let's shred this fucking thing.
[110:17.17]What do you say?
[110:18.47]Let's go.
[110:27.24]Hey, what's this one?
[110:28.58]Oh, Kung Fu.
[110:29.44]Remember that game?
[110:30.06]That was a lot of fun too.
[110:31.12]Let me get it in there.
[110:31.80]Fucking dumb thing.
[110:37.14]It's a fucking crap.
[110:40.74]Oh yeah, remember the Power Rangers game?
[110:42.52]That game sure was fun, wasn't it?
[110:44.10]Fucking piece of crap.
[110:50.00]All these games suck.
[110:51.06]Fuck the Kinect.
[110:52.12]What's this one?
[110:53.92]Stuntman Ignite.
[110:54.78]No, that was a good one.
[110:55.48]That was a fun game.
[110:58.31]This one, oh yeah, remember the Pets game?
[111:00.45]Fuckin' dumbass game.
[111:06.14]Oh!
[111:08.14]My tie!
[111:09.80]It got my tie!
[111:11.80]Just like in the fuckin' Gremlins movie!
[111:14.70]Oh shit!
[111:18.19]Oh!
[111:32.09]Uh, now we're gonna play Haunt.
[111:35.05]Should be fun.
[111:38.79]At least I hope it is.
[111:43.63]And somebody just gave a fuckin' hundred bucks!
[111:49.14]Oh, no, no, no, Xbox, no, Xbox, stop.
[111:51.90]Xbox, stop it.
[111:54.14]Cancel.
[111:56.04]Cancel, okay.
[112:02.27]It was AB Joe.
[112:04.87]Just gave a hundred bucks.
[112:08.69]Thank you so much, AB Joe.
[112:11.25]They say, hey, Yerma.
[112:14.91]Good to see you up and about again.
[112:16.11]I got your Night Sky t-shirt a while back and I've had six strangers compliment the shirt so far.
[112:21.84]Feels good, man.
[112:23.80]You've always been there to help us all through the hard times.
[112:26.14]Know that if you ever run into some rough times of your own, know that we're all here for you.
[112:29.92]Love you, man.
[112:30.42]Keep up the good work.
[112:32.67]Thanks a lot.
[112:33.43]Thank you.
[112:36.36]You know, I... Sometimes, you know, sometimes I feel pretty down too.
[112:41.76]I'm just like anybody else, right?
[112:43.96]You got good days, you got bad days.
[112:46.48]But I really appreciate that.
[112:47.74]Thank you.
[112:50.74]I'm not going to shred the Kinect.
[112:55.58]But seriously though, thank you so much.
[112:58.02]We also had five community subs from Local Boomer.
[113:01.44]Thank you, Local Boomer.
[113:03.83]And then Phylactery gave 50 more fucking dollars.
[113:08.00]Use this to buy some new legs.
[113:10.12]Also, there's a machete and a tape down in that tomb you left.
[113:17.48]Okay.
[113:19.20]Thank you.
[113:19.66]Alright, so this is called Haunt.
[113:24.25]I'm gonna change the name of the game.
[113:25.47]Is this even- I don't think this is even on Twitch.
[113:38.46]I guess it is.
[113:40.90]Alright.
[113:42.03]Let's go.
[113:45.39]I'm ready.
[113:45.93]Wait.
[113:47.01]I'm not ready.
[113:54.92]Haunt.
[114:03.80]I think this one's a little more lighthearted than the other one.
[114:06.26]Is that right?
[114:09.15]I don't know.
[114:10.17]I think this one's supposed to be a better game.
[114:15.72]Start game leaderboard is helping out with downloadable content.
[114:19.24]Let's just go.
[114:24.84]New game.
[114:29.21]To ensure that Haunt functions correctly, please ensure that the Xbox 360 Kinect sensor and microphone are calibrated.
[114:35.25]Would you like to... No.
[114:36.17]I've already done this.
[114:38.29]I did this, like, fucking all day.
[114:44.27]You can use either hand to control your flashlight.
[114:46.01]If one arm gets tired, just change to the other.
[114:48.39]So I got a flashlight in one hand.
[114:53.46]Shredded.
[114:54.14]I can't shred this one.
[114:55.16]It's digital download only, so it cannot be shredded.
[114:57.94]As much as I would fucking love to.
[115:07.25]I like a Jerma, well, that was a coffee pasta that I haven't seen in a while.
[115:10.80]Alright, let's go.
[115:16.20]Avatar Award unlocked.
[115:17.98]Hey, hey, hello down there, buddy.
[115:21.62]Hey, hello.
[115:23.10]Gamer picture?
[115:23.88]Are you alright?
[115:24.94]Can you hear me?
[115:26.68]You're not dead, are you?
[115:27.84]Pick up that flashlight if you're not dead.
[115:29.48]Just reach out your arm and grab it.
[115:34.23]What's a pickup flashlight?
[115:39.43]Guess I got it.
[115:43.16]Oh Wow, you're not dead.
[115:45.02]That's a nice surprise and now you can see where you're going, which is good To aim the flashlight move your arm just like you're holding a real flashlight Hey, can you test something for me?
[115:59.34]There are some suits of armor around you try turning towards them and shining your flashlight at them turn the left or right look up and look down
[116:10.47]Pretty scary game.
[116:31.88]Hey, who's that handsome fellow?
[116:33.80]Why, it's me, Benjamin.
[116:35.80]Surprise!
[116:36.50]I mean, if you think Harry Potter is scary, this could probably be in that same universe.
[116:41.04]As you can see, I am stuck in this painting, but the good news is I can possess any portrait in the house, so I've got that going for me.
[116:49.37]Still, I wish I could walk around freely like you can.
[116:52.41]Hey, wait, you can still walk around, right?
[116:54.71]He's doing monkey hats.
[117:02.86]What is it?
[117:03.24]To move in the direction you're facing, simply walk on the spot.
[117:18.63]That's so much more intuitive.
[117:19.41]Left.
[117:32.47]When you're approaching corridor junction, arrows like this will appear to show you the available directions.
[117:38.09]To choose which way to go and your flashlight in the direction you want to take, the arrows will change to show the selected direction.
[117:45.18]Then just keep walking.
[117:47.02]There's no need to stop while you decide.
[117:49.66]If you'd rather move around freely, you can turn assistive movement off at any time on the settings page.
[117:54.26]I ain't gonna do that.
[117:56.84]Absolutely not.
[117:59.34]We're gonna stay on aim assist.
[118:22.88]Alright You made it welcome to my grand hall it's pretty grand right I mean under all the dust and stuff Let me take what are you guys saying?
[118:37.10]No, no, no, no, no, no, no Okay, you want a little tour I'll move to another painting and you try to find me.
[118:42.91]Okay.
[118:43.85]Oh, this is going to be fun Trying to find the painting that Benjamin moved to
[119:00.27]This kid's game?
[119:02.17]I didn't look that up.
[119:03.15]No, this is supposed to be good.
[119:14.13]What painting?
[119:19.17]I got you.
[119:19.53]Right here.
[119:21.40]But I can't interact with the chat room!
[119:59.61]Alright.
[120:00.19]Am I on my own yet?
[120:03.73]That was a little scary.
[120:04.71]I'm going to go left or right.
[120:05.43]I'll say left.
[120:05.81]I made the right call.
[120:07.21]Okay.
[120:07.37]Open it.
[120:36.84]nothing in there aha look at that vitality sweet delicious vitality there's vitality in there physical form I bet you've never seen that before have you I've got a bunch of it hidden around the place and you're gonna need it uh not that this job is dangerous or anything but if you do lose all your vitality then well let's just say I can't be held responsible let's keep moving
[121:04.21]Benjamin will often have useful, interesting, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[121:07.22]If you're stuck or no, I am not, I'm not, I'm not a kid.
[121:11.18]I'm ready.
[121:14.30]Let's go.
[121:23.67]Dodge.
[121:38.01]Alright, this is where it gets scary, guys.
[121:40.29]Turn the lights down in your house.
[121:43.75]I don't want to listen to Benjamin.
[121:55.08]Fine.
[121:55.84]What do you have to say?
[121:57.84]This next room has something really great in it.
[122:00.36]Or was it something really dangerous?
[122:02.06]I can't remember.
[122:03.34]Either way, open the door because I'm dying to find out.
[122:08.63]Doors work like any other objects, just hold the light on it and- Vitality.
[122:24.30]What was that?
[122:41.96]Alright, I'm gonna get full vitality here.
[122:45.90]Man, I am seeing some monk-a-esses right now, and I agree with you.
[122:51.29]I completely agree.
[122:52.31]Oh!
[123:12.06]Don't be something in here.
[123:13.46]Don't be something in here.
[123:17.72]No, it's vitality.
[123:18.84]Good.
[123:28.01]Was it a slug?
[123:30.41]Extra vitality vial found.
[123:33.96]What does that do?
[123:36.50]Ooh, a vitality vial.
[123:38.62]Hey, you guys are shaking out here in the comments.
[123:43.33]Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

[124:19.55]Oh, there it is.
[124:29.52]Collect the key and unlock the door.
[124:31.04]When a specific item is needed to proceed, an icon showing what's required will appear on the screen.

[126:22.19]Wanna punch him?
[126:42.27]He already punched the ghost.
[126:43.77]This is not even a horror game.
[126:45.79]We only played one horror- There's only one horror game for the Kinect.
[126:55.19]And we played it.
[127:11.87]Alright, be done.

[128:18.09]Hold on, let's get in here and see if the game's any good.

[130:17.55]Have you been good?
[130:20.90]I think you've been good.
[130:25.08]This game sucks.
[130:27.60]Don't say that yet.
[130:28.39]We have to get out of the tutorial.
[130:30.67]Hold on, though.
[130:33.49]If you've been good... I've got something to show you.
[130:43.91]So, what I'm about to show you guys...
[130:49.76]is something really exciting.
[130:55.05]This is a sneak peek at one of the robots for the carnival coming up in a few weeks.
[131:04.83]So, if you do not want to be spoiled, close your eyes and block your ears.

[140:27.03]Like that's pretty rare.
[140:28.53]That's pretty rare for the streamer to be bored.
[140:30.49]It is.
[140:32.45]I don't typically get bored of a game.
[140:34.75]Like, I'm bored.

[150:05.35]Guy Fieri, come on.
[150:08.17]I'm Guy Fieri, and this is Minute to Win It.
[150:11.27]Our contestants have been practicing these mind-blowing games using household items.
[150:18.92]But how will they do in front of a million viewers?
[150:21.80]Whoa!
[150:22.04]With a million dollars on the line, it's time to find out.
[150:24.40]It's a million people here.

[151:48.37]Number of clicks?
[151:49.69]Trigger your arm pedometers by moving the correct arm.

[153:47.24]How the fuck can somebody do that?
[153:52.79]Total clicks.
[153:53.49]How many clicks on my left leg?
[153:55.11]Five?

[155:32.55]It's not easy.
[155:50.79]It's do or die on this one, so now you know what to do.

[157:18.82]I'm gonna throw up.
[157:45.37]No matter what happens, no matter what challenge is put in front of you, you've banked $1,000.
[157:49.69]The question is, do you want to stay and play, or do you want to take the cash?
[157:55.38]Guys, and no.
[157:57.72]No, there's not somebody mowing the lawn out here.
[158:04.47]There are no lawns.
[158:05.23]This is Las Vegas.

[158:24.62]Nah, it's another fucking running one.

[159:18.29]One life.
[159:18.91]Okay.
[159:19.33]How many points?
[159:19.91]Nine?

[159:54.08]Great job!
[160:40.09]Am I taking a shit?
[160:40.99]I don't know, what does it look like?

[215:27.93]Got to do it again?
[215:28.55]Alright.
[215:33.97]Nice header.
[215:34.81]Nice goal.
[215:36.67]Okay.
[215:37.53]He's cheering.
[215:38.83]I'm cheering him on.
[215:39.77]Go for it.
[215:40.35]You can do it.
[215:43.01]Good kick.
[215:47.44]No!
[215:48.84]No!
[215:49.91]The teams were neck and neck there, but the better team just went that little bit further.
[215:55.33]I wasn't paying attention.
[216:09.05]That was a workout.
[216:10.47]Here are your best bits.
[216:17.90]Why does it look like my pants don't... My lower body looks like it's not part of my upper body.
[216:27.68]Why do I have, like, Humpty Dumpty pants?
[216:31.10]Doesn't it look like somebody just screwed me on?
[216:32.90]It's weird.
[216:44.06]It's a two-person.
[216:44.70]Yeah, it's a two-person.
[216:50.75]Alright, change sport.
[216:56.95]Alright, I got, uh, beach volleyball.
[216:59.35]I'm gonna do... What do I wanna do?
[217:05.48]Hmm, table tennis?
[217:07.00]Sounds like fun.
[217:12.36]Bowling?
[217:12.72]I'll do bowling after.
[217:13.38]We'll do them all.
[217:19.38]Stay with that professional skill level, too.
[217:22.54]That makes the most sense.
[217:35.21]So it's right in?
[217:35.79]I think so.
[217:36.69]We've got a professional gamer here.
[217:45.51]I'm going to have to take a shower after this.
[217:49.67]I'm like 5,000 degrees right now.
[217:55.65]I'm going to take a bath.
[217:56.75]I'm just going to lie in the bath.
[217:58.31]I'm going to lie in the bath so I can just go under and just move my hair around.
[218:06.07]I'm not doing those movements.
[218:09.93]We all have high hopes for this match.
[218:21.18]Would you call yourself a table tennis star?
[218:26.21]No.
[218:27.23]I'd call myself a only-play-table-tennis-when-it's-part-of-a-video-game-like-this.
[218:32.59]And never any other circumstance.
[218:35.11]Same thing with tennis.
[218:40.39]Tennis, to me, whenever I played tennis, was always just to end up being, okay, here we go, it's a really, really finesse-based game, but I just hit it so hard every time it just soars over the whole thing.
[218:51.64]I can't do it.
[218:52.99]It'll be like, I'll get one volley, like, dunk, dunk.
[218:57.31]And the thing will just, it's like, I can't do it.
[218:59.53]It's gone.
[219:03.43]It always goes, like, way out of control.
[219:09.24]Move backwards.
[219:09.78]Ah, shit, sorry.
[219:10.44]Alright, let's go.
[219:11.82]Read the paddle.
[219:14.80]Right hand.
[219:15.20]Into the action we go.
[219:26.73]Stop celebrating, you idiot.
[219:40.26]They're off screen.
[219:42.46]I'm supposed to stay way back.
[219:55.33]Nice forehand return.
[219:57.77]That's a net ball.
[219:58.75]Woo!
[220:01.74]Unbelievable.
[220:03.10]That's it.
[220:03.58]I got it.
[220:03.94]Right on the side.
[220:06.80]That works.
[220:13.74]Check.
[220:14.16]It's clipped the net on its way over.
[220:21.50]It's out of play, sadly.
[220:23.05]It's a foul.
[220:25.47]I'm gonna go as far as I can.
[220:26.73]You stink!
[220:55.19]Fuck, I was trying to give him a thing to serve up.
[221:04.56]You know how much it costs to license that song?
[221:13.85]For it to play for one or two seconds?
[221:19.59]That has to be hundreds of thousands of dollars to license that song.
[221:24.96]You gotta have a whole montage with that song or it's not worth it.
[221:29.06]That's so stupid, I crossed the plane of the Kinect.
[222:00.06]That was a smash.
[222:05.20]Yeah, that's a 6-5.
[222:28.86]I got my eye on you, buddy.
[222:30.56]This is an even game.
[222:35.90]Service change.
[222:40.91]Such an evenly matched game, this.
[222:53.15]Shit.
[222:56.00]Not much between these two.
[223:24.34]He's gonna beat me!
[223:29.42]He's gonna beat me.
[223:32.12]I'm gonna lose.
[223:43.51]I'm out of gas.
[223:48.78]I've rented a gas already.
[223:50.48]It's only been like four and a half hours.
[223:52.87]I'm out of gas already.
[223:54.09]Need contact with the net.
[224:26.21]That was a great match.
[224:29.89]Choke.
[224:31.84]Come on.
[224:32.48]That was intense.
[224:56.86]Hadn't even been four hours.
[224:58.14]It's been four.
[224:59.28]Oh, it's got the D to my property?
[225:14.85]Is that what we were playing for?
[225:16.29]I wasn't aware.
[225:26.15]Alright, time for bowling.
[225:28.19]Everybody wants to see bowling.
[225:50.21]Throw your hands overhead.
[225:59.57]Alright, let's go.
[226:03.61]It's kind of getting dark in here.
[226:04.63]I think I need to turn the lights up just a little while we have some lighting.
[226:14.96]Let's go over now to our own bowling Paradise, Neon Lanes.
[226:18.80]Enjoy.
[226:20.10]Welcome, and thanks for joining for what looks like great magic.
[226:27.86]This looks like
[226:32.11]Spin on the ball?
[226:35.21]Maybe?
[226:35.65]Possibly?
[226:41.35]Reach to the right or left to pick up a ball.
[226:45.53]Reach with your arms straight out.
[226:48.19]OK, and then back, forward, toss.
[226:51.01]Swing your arms straight back and then forwards to bowl the ball.
[226:57.03]Yeah.
[226:57.84]What about spin?
[227:01.65]spin is very important how do I do it if you want to add spin bring your arm across your body alright let's go
[227:37.55]Not bad.
[227:37.83]Alright Sarge, your turn.
[227:39.30]Oh, you got a strike.
[227:51.06]Okay.
[228:06.46]I would have loved to seen it.
[228:17.75]No, I'm trying to do like a cool thing.
[228:19.73]Into the gutter it goes.
[228:26.73]Here's the scoreboard.
[228:28.55]Wow, will you look at that?
[228:39.26]Time now for frame three that means you got two.
[228:43.61]Okay.
[228:45.47]I'll believe it.
[228:46.01]Sure Bullshit It's bear oh, come on that sucks
[229:08.90]It's a product placement ball?
[229:11.04]How so?
[229:18.81]This guy just only gets strikes?
[229:30.31]Get one of me too!
[229:42.60]Bear.
[229:44.26]Finally!
[229:46.11]Jeez.
[229:48.41]I have to earn these.
[229:51.09]Well, it's alright.
[229:51.65]He'll choke like four or five times.
[229:53.03]Three pins, two pins, three pins, three pins, four pins, three pins, three pins, I win.
[229:57.58]I'm getting destroyed.
[230:17.97]That would have been cool if it actually spun.
[230:29.49]Yes!
[230:33.17]This game tried to one-up Wii Sports.
[230:35.69]You can smell the desperation.
[230:48.70]I have to get some strikes, but this is it.
[230:59.31]Come on!
[231:00.73]Wii Sports is way better.
[231:03.01]Remember, like, Wii Sports, you could, like, go all the way back here and be like, bang!
[231:07.15]And it would spin all the way down?
[231:11.91]You could go, like, whack!
[231:28.36]What's an average bowling score?
[231:33.75]Like 150?
[231:34.41]120?
[231:34.43]How did it spin the other way?
[231:43.46]How did it spin the other way?
[231:45.54]You know what?
[231:45.88]Fuck it.
[231:46.14]We're going the other way.
[231:54.62]That's what we call an open frame, I'm afraid.
[231:57.12]Here's the scoreboard.
[231:58.56]Wow, will you look at that?
[232:09.54]We're heading into the eighth frame now.
[232:26.65]I didn't think you could do that.
[232:37.81]You can actually break it.
[232:39.60]I have to see that again.
[232:41.52]Well, the scores say it all.
[232:46.12]This is better than Wii Sports because of that alone.
[232:50.18]Might be.
[232:52.14]Oh no, you got eight pins for the first time.
[232:54.24]Oh no.
[232:54.87]Who knows.
[232:55.55]Oh god.
[232:56.87]Oh god.
[232:57.33]I was trying to do the dive protecting.
[233:12.30]That went way too fast for what I'm trying to do.
[233:24.73]Anytime somebody makes fun of you, when you go bowling, and you do that, and you get like four or five strikes, don't ever feel ashamed of that.
[233:37.04]Well, people are sitting there going like, no, cool, cool.
[233:43.60]I went like this, straight down going really slow to knock to every single fucking pin over.
[233:49.53]It's not how cool you look doing it, it's how many pins you knock down.
[233:57.35]That would be not true.
[234:04.57]It's how many pins you knocked down.
[234:08.52]You could turn around backwards and go like this through your legs.
[234:12.62]It doesn't matter.
[234:13.48]Did you knock down all the pins?
[234:42.35]94!
[234:42.41]Not even 100.
[234:43.73]So how does all this affect the scores?
[234:45.76]198.
[234:52.56]This player will really mature with time spent practicing.
[234:59.36]Bullshit.
[235:02.99]Absolute dog shit.
[235:05.13]You've just moved up a level!
[235:17.06]I don't get it.
[235:32.48]He's still level 1.
[235:34.38]How do you level up in this game?
[235:37.04]I don't get it.
[235:37.48]I don't understand.
[235:42.42]You lost to 10 Pinwheels.
[235:46.87]Clever.
[235:48.85]That was cute.
[235:49.39]That was cute.
[235:53.22]You're right.
[235:53.86]Alright, track and field I feel like I'm gonna do really good at.
[236:01.02]It's just moving your body violently around in a circle.
[236:03.58]I'm gonna go champion.
[236:04.72]I'm gonna get, here we go.
[236:10.20]This is all about just moving violently, like shaking violently.
[236:16.86]I should nail it.
[236:26.06]You're gonna break a bone?
[236:27.80]That's not, you can't break your bone here unless I like slipped.
[236:31.05]Okay, if I like was going like freaking out, like wildly moving around and then I went like that and my leg flew up underneath and I went back and landed like on my neck or something.
[236:40.39]That's impossible.
[236:54.77]What happened to my hair?
[236:57.33]I just have a hat on so it's easy to keep it away from my facade.
[237:00.13]You saw how it looked the other time we played this.
[237:02.73]It was all over the place.
[237:04.96]It looked crazy.
[237:06.38]I looked crazed.
[237:07.82]And I didn't want to look crazed anymore.
[237:13.20]Here comes the falling gag.
[237:21.65]Okay, he's gonna shake.
[237:23.17]Run in place.
[237:25.22]See, here's what I'm gonna try here, because I'm not gonna take my feet off the ground.
[237:32.30]See if I can just go with my back here and just... Hey, what you doing?
[237:45.57]Hey, what you doing?
[237:46.73]Mind and body in perfect harmony.
[237:48.85]That's what breaks world records.
[237:51.03]Alright, here we go.
[237:53.55]No!
[238:21.57]look at the results for that event much as we thought catching up with the scores now and just look at that alright javelin I will join us at the beginning of the javelin event okay I'll do this one again right or left to grab a javelin grab a javelin reach with your arms straight out okay run in place to get to the throw zone
[238:53.11]Hold the javelin.
[238:58.99]When the ground turns green, throw the javelin.
[239:01.91]Throw.
[239:03.65]Throw high.
[239:04.41]Alright, that was pretty.
[239:13.08]Alright, let's go.
[239:18.90]And this throw needs to be good.
[239:33.52]Come on, man.
[239:47.50]Now the results from that event have been processed.
[239:50.12]We can see where we're at.
[239:51.27]32 is so bad.
[240:18.51]Well, here's the last event's results.
[240:20.91]Make what you will of that.
[240:23.89]Third throw now.
[240:25.61]How do these athletes cope with such tension?
[240:45.64]Let's see how that event's results affect where we stand.
[240:50.66]At this point in time, that's how it's looking.
[240:55.44]Sprint, javelin, high jump, discuss?
[240:57.96]What are we discussing?
[240:59.10]It's like a debate platform?
[241:03.78]Run in place to get to the jump zone.
[241:07.67]Lift your knees.
[241:12.27]I will destroy in the discuss.
[241:15.03]I can sit there and talk about anything for hours.
[241:17.45]People will leave because I'll bore them.
[241:19.61]Okay, so run, run, and jump.
[241:20.91]I have to, like, explode out of this.
[241:31.26]A firm footing and calm nerves is what's needed here.
[242:04.35]It's got to be a record.
[242:16.50]The previous event's results make reading.
[242:21.81]The second jump and an improvement is vital now.
[242:25.35]Stop moving.
[242:34.67]Dumb game.
[242:37.65]I don't know how to make this go faster.
[242:39.63]Okay, just take a look at the results from the previous event.
[242:47.85]No, stop!
[242:48.71]I figured it out.
[242:55.45]I figured it out.
[243:08.29]I think when you stand at a certain length away and you throw it, the most power comes from when you're spinning around the momentum.
[243:38.90]LOL.
[243:40.08]That's it.
[243:41.08]Do I need to spin?
[243:55.37]This athlete will be wanting a good base to build from with their first attempt.
[244:08.28]And the results are in for that last event.
[244:22.45]I'm just a fucking clown.
[244:24.07]I'm like the comedy routine that's here at the Olympics.
[244:27.37]The pressure is on.
[244:28.93]Going way past the 40 meter mark.
[244:33.88]It's a new personal best for this athlete.
[244:40.01]Straight into the sky.
[244:44.84]That person's not even trying.
[244:47.12]That person's not trying.
[244:48.86]A quick look at the results for that event.
[244:51.80]Much as we thought.
[244:54.54]Third throw.
[244:55.85]And if ever there had to be success, it's now.
[245:03.31]Results from the last event, and my, my, take a look.
[245:08.67]Take a look at these scores.
[245:10.89]Who would have believed it?
[245:13.63]It's daunting for the athletes, but their hurdles are next.
[245:20.38]I can't do it.
[245:20.90]At least it fucking helps.
[245:23.02]Run in place.
[245:26.40]Lift your knees.
[245:35.11]As soon as the hurdle turns green, jump in place.
[245:40.83]Jump with both feet off the ground.
[245:59.64]Do any of these athletes have what it takes to beat the current world record?
[246:10.82]On your marks.
[246:46.74]Fuck all of this!
[246:47.56]I ain't crossin'!
[247:03.50]Today for this athlete, it was the taking part that mattered.
[247:10.23]You've climbed one level!
[247:41.42]Now for your sporting highlights!
[247:53.51]That's like I'm trying not to fall over.
[248:02.54]That's like I'm shimmying on the edge of the cliff.
[248:18.05]Volleyball is the last one.
[248:34.34]How many Kinect games came out for the Xbox One?
[248:39.38]I wanna say three.
[248:48.73]That was so many for the 360.
[248:54.62]Alright, so volleyball is just table tennis with a bigger ball and larger people.
[249:14.33]You gotta be tall to play volleyball.
[249:16.19]All the volleyball players I've ever known were like 6'2".
[249:18.99]You gotta like get over the net and like stuff.
[249:37.71]That's right.
[249:38.57]You join us live at Waveside, where the crowd are really turning up the heat for today's hot match.
[249:48.05]People paddle?
[249:49.31]Toss the ball upwards, then hit it with your hand as it falls.
[250:01.65]Move to the target and hit the ball with your hand.
[250:04.89]And then dunk.
[250:12.23]Jump.
[250:13.63]Jump, and then you have to stuff it.
[250:15.46]Jump.
[250:15.94]Stuff.
[250:16.18]Alright.
[250:16.54]I got it.
[250:16.82]What just fucking happened?
[250:43.54]I have no idea what's going on.
[250:46.90]Okay.
[250:49.04]Ooh, big dive.
[251:27.09]Ooh, nice
[251:57.01]Change ends.
[251:58.68]Power serve, like it.
[252:05.54]Take the shot.
[252:06.22]What can they do with this?
[252:13.15]Shit.
[252:17.65]One, four.
[252:22.17]My body is so sweaty.
[252:25.73]I can't even keep my earphones up.
[252:33.09]Two hands.
[252:55.51]The serve goes to the other side after that point.
[253:01.85]The ball is served and it's game on.
[253:04.05]Is that legal?
[253:07.41]Can they make the cut?
[253:10.19]Each player knows exactly what the other is doing.
[253:20.96]Steady progression of superb moves here.
[253:25.41]That's an amazing block.
[253:28.62]Serve it up.
[253:29.58]Let's go.
[253:29.94]Give it to me.
[253:37.76]Don't jump higher than that.
[253:42.29]Why are you waiting so long?
[253:45.01]You're killing me.
[253:49.03]He's killing me.
[253:59.45]Come on Take the shot
[254:40.01]Pretty good.
[254:41.29]Thinking of the win.
[254:42.41]I'm blaming it all on my teammate.
[254:43.65]See how far I've jumped?
[254:57.12]I've jumped really high.
[255:09.43]I am too.
[255:10.15]I just threw the game.
[255:11.73]I'm tired.
[255:16.19]I'm tired.
[255:42.49]Nothing in the air?
[255:43.15]How can you not take a picture in the air?
[255:47.19]Like, why?
[255:47.71]Get me up here.
[255:48.65]Jumping in the... Come on.

[297:51.36]Thank you for being a great streamer and love you chat.
[297:54.66]Chat doesn't get enough credit sometimes.
[297:58.24]I'm glad that you are shouting out your fellow chat members.
[298:04.00]It's good stuff.
[298:07.27]Happy birthday, ThunderSquid.

[298:24.45]Or for the both of us.
[298:26.88]I'm not sure.
[298:29.72]Why don't we get the credits rolling?
[298:33.49]There's still some bits to do, but let's get it rolling.
[298:36.69]I will see you guys tomorrow for Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.
[298:40.89]It's going to be a nostalgia stream tomorrow.
[298:46.55]If I were you, I would show up if you think that's interesting and you'd like to watch that stream.
[298:58.89]thank you everybody all the subs the huge amount of community subs that came in earlier as well much love to y'all Super Mario RPG is the best SNES game I would I would agree Chrono Trigger's up there too
[299:24.36]There are a few.
[299:25.50]And most of... Honestly, like, at least the top five Super Nintendo games for me are RPGs.
[299:34.25]At least three of the top five, I think, are.
[299:38.93]It was just kind of the golden era for RPGs.
[299:42.61]Turn-based, at least.
[299:45.23]But thank you to Tingy for the $2.50.
[299:50.07]I was talking about the first game where it makes you put your hands to your side, still as a board, and turning your shoulders.
[299:56.07]You kind of look like this.
[300:04.46]So many of these games require so much, like, random T-posing.
[300:07.34]Hold on, I gotta load it.
[300:16.22]Yeah, like a luge.
[300:20.14]I did do this a lot, you're right.
[300:31.36]You are right.
[300:32.06]That is a terrifying sport, by the way.
[300:43.26]What a scary sport this is.
[300:46.09]Don't you go more than 50, 60, 70 miles per hour on this thing?
[300:51.60]Can you imagine the speeds?
[300:58.96]You're just on, like, what amounts to a potato wedge.
[301:06.05]That takes some skill to be able to maneuver that thing around.
[301:14.67]But thank you, Tinky.
[301:15.35]Thank you, Bone Jackal, for the five dollars.
[301:18.85]Jeremy, you may not believe me, but you were my substitute teacher back when I was in middle school.
[301:26.54]The rest of this comment is just horseshit.
[301:30.50]I'm not going to read the rest of this.
[301:35.43]That is not real, and I'm not going to even read it.
[301:39.45]Thank you for the five dollars, Bone Jackal.
[301:42.11]I appreciate it.
[301:42.73]Thank you.
[301:51.36]I... No.
[301:52.24]Okay.
[301:52.58]Thank you for the $5.
[301:55.04]Skin!
[301:58.12]Bone Jackal the Bullshitter.
[301:59.73]Yeah, that's the new nickname there.
[302:03.31]Being rude to your old students.
[302:07.15]Why don't you scroll back and see what they wrote.
[302:09.49]And then tell me if you want me to say that on stream.
[302:12.55]Hey, Lieutenant Campbell, thanks for the $2.50.
[302:18.39]Hey, Jeremy, long-time viewer, first-time tipper.
[302:20.07]I just want to say, don't let the balders and olders get you down.
[302:24.46]You have hair that rivals Matt Mercer's, and he's an actual god made flesh.
[302:29.22]I'm going to be hunkered down for the hurricane reaming into Florida.
[302:32.92]I hope.
[302:34.56]Oh, that's true.
[302:35.54]Everybody stay safe.
[302:36.96]Is it here now?
[302:45.55]I know that was happening in the next day or so.
[302:49.73]Take care of yourselves, guys.
[302:51.85]Your safety is way more important than anything else.
[303:07.98]I wonder when it's at.
[303:11.23]It's going to be over, is it Miami?
[303:14.25]Something like that, right?
[303:18.36]Just be careful, guys.
[303:19.90]That shit is scary.
[303:24.47]Do what you need to do.
[303:25.33]Stock up on the things you need to stock up on.
[303:26.95]Make sure your friends and family are safe.
[303:29.61]Hurricanes are no joke, especially when they're... as powerful as they, you know, possibly could be with this one, so...
[303:42.96]But I wish you the best of luck.
[303:45.71]Thank you.
[303:46.11]That was Lieutenant Campbell.
[303:47.81]Stay safe.
[303:51.21]Thank you so much for the $2.50.
[303:55.27]Thank you PretendDeer for the $2.50.
[303:57.50]Feel like I gotta throw some bits to you for the amazing stream today.
[304:01.64]That's not necessary.
[304:04.00]But I will accept them.
[304:05.96]Thank you.
[304:07.86]For the $2.50.
[304:08.10]Much love to you.

[305:06.34]Didn't Ah!
[305:06.96]Real Monsters used to do that?
[305:10.96]That was the whole premise of that show, right?
[305:12.58]You'd be sleeping and they would crawl into your ears?
[305:17.30]And give you nightmares and stuff?
[305:19.47]That's a scary show.
[305:31.53]No, that's true, yeah.
[305:33.95]Ah, real monsters.
[305:35.21]That was their job, wasn't it?
[305:36.75]That was part of their career.
[305:38.77]As a monster.
[305:39.57]Like, an ah, real monster.
[305:40.63]You had to go and, like, scare people and give them nightmares.
[305:53.17]That's not Monsters, Inc.
[305:54.01]That's our real monsters.
[306:02.12]Thank you, Peaceful Haley, for the 250.
[306:05.26]Jerma, it's been a while, but I want to tell you in chat that I got a role in Dragon Ball GT Abridged.

[306:26.64]That's pretty fucking awesome.
[306:36.15]I've never seen Dragon Ball.
[306:40.57]But that's fucking cool.
[306:41.69]That's really cool.
[306:53.49]Because Dragon Ball, every time it's ever explained to me, there's like four or five different Dragon Ball series, right?
[307:05.06]There's Dragon Ball Dragon Ball.
[307:06.84]There's Dragon Ball Kai.
[307:09.12]There's Dragon Ball GT.
[307:10.44]There's Dragon Ball Super.
[307:12.70]And don't they follow a different timeline or something?
[307:25.89]He knows.
[307:26.85]Yeah, I know.
[307:33.13]I've never seen it, though.
[307:33.97]But good luck to you.

[307:49.78]Thank you, PeacefulHaley.
[307:50.42]Too good.
[307:54.15]Hey, NefariousBear, thanks for the three dollars.
[307:55.93]Thanks for being one of the only streamers to make me bust my gut laughing on a regular basis.
[308:00.01]If you're still taking videos, here's an extremely late green screen video.
[308:05.53]Uh, we're gonna hold on to it.
[308:07.91]Add it to the list of things.
[308:09.22]We're going to have a submission room probably this weekend.
[308:14.32]For community stuff.
[308:15.06]Because I want that, well, maybe, yeah.
[308:19.12]Either tomorrow or Monday or so.
[308:21.62]I want it to be up there fairly quickly.
[308:25.02]Art showcase, video showcase, content showcase.
[308:28.78]We're going to do it once a month or so.
[308:31.26]When we feel like we have enough stuff.
[308:34.88]There is no deadline on these things.
[308:37.40]It's not, oh, well, you have to get it in there by September 6th.
[308:41.79]Otherwise, there's no way it's ever going to be shown.
[308:44.41]No, it's just going to be an open submission platform on that Discord channel.
[308:49.87]And we're just going to take stuff.
[308:51.53]I'm going to pull stuff into some slides and we're just going to make it.
[308:55.71]There'll be, obviously, rules for submitting.
[309:00.89]But there's no deadline.
[309:02.38]Tomorrow's in like 30 minutes.
[309:03.64]Well, it'll be there within the next few days.
[309:06.44]In the Discord channel.
[309:07.64]Also, there is Discord channels for the Activity Book stream.
[309:12.94]Which I keep, like, pushing forward and forward and forward and forward.
[309:16.40]But it will happen.
[309:17.65]That stream is going to happen once there's enough interesting stuff that comes in.
[309:22.59]Activity-wise.
[309:25.51]I mean backwards, not backwards and backwards and backwards and backwards, not forwards.
[309:32.46]But thank you NefariousBear, I look forward to seeing it.
[309:36.24]Is the activity book stream even real?
[309:37.84]It will be.
[309:41.15]It will be.
[309:46.35]SirK9 thanks for the five dollars.
[309:50.69]I'm feeling like a star.
[309:52.69]You can't stop my shine.
[309:54.01]I'm loving Cloud City I'm so long.
[309:58.23]You just didn't say it's just the W thing with every other letter is a W Thanks for the five dollars, I appreciate it.
[310:07.48]C4G, thanks for the 250 Today is Hatsune Miku's birthday.
[310:13.49]Did you remember to tell her happy birthday?
[310:15.11]Happy birthday!
[310:16.69]Happy birthday!
[310:24.22]Is it?
[310:25.59]What?
[310:31.99]I can't believe it.
[310:36.81]That's the... the... the... SEGA Pop Star, right?
[310:42.63]I just told you who that... You wrote in all caps, do you even know who that is?
[310:45.55]I do, and I know exactly who that is.
[310:49.02]That's the Pop Star made by SEGA.
[310:55.23]I couldn't tell you one of the songs.
[310:58.93]I don't know any of them.
[311:00.73]I just know that they keep making games.
[311:09.71]I don't know what they are.
[311:10.53]Are they like singing and dancing games?
[311:13.21]Song games?
[311:16.69]Does Hatsune Miku have albums or is it just games?
[311:19.37]Rhythm games.
[311:25.86]No, there are songs.
[311:30.08]It's just a music program.
[311:36.67]Well, I'll make sure to play the entire OST of Hatsune Miku's artificial existence after I take a bath.
[311:48.94]But thank you.
[311:49.96]Happy birthday to... I don't know why I'm saying happy birthday to this entity.
[311:57.66]I guess, alright, let's have it.
[311:59.00]I guess I'm gonna say it again.
[312:01.87]She created Minecraft.
[312:04.69]Wow.
[312:05.67]That's quite an achievement.
[312:08.29]Yeah, I really did want to do a GTA casino stream.
[312:24.35]But, I don't know, maybe.
[312:25.99]Maybe I'll just, who cares, and just join a public lobby.
[312:29.77]You gotta be careful, though.
[312:32.51]Isn't GTA, like, the easiest game on Earth?
[312:36.37]To have your, like, IP just get grabbed?
[312:38.93]That's why I haven't done it yet.
[312:47.60]Yes, it is.
[312:48.50]Yeah.
[312:50.44]Yeah.
[312:52.06]That's Roblox.
[312:57.67]You can literally hack into single-player GTA V games.
[313:05.25]How would you even... I do use a VPN.
[313:12.06]But to me, I don't know, I haven't used a VPN for that long.
[313:14.98]I really feel like a VPN is a guy that, like, is standing outside my door.
[313:19.86]And, like, what if you punch the guy in the face that's standing there guarding the door?
[313:24.92]And he just falls over.
[313:25.88]Is it possible?
[313:28.89]Yes, it is a paid VPN.
[313:38.11]No.
[313:39.43]Oh, okay.
[313:40.75]Cool.
[313:49.10]Nice.
[313:50.70]Alright, maybe I will do it then.
[313:53.52]Alright, that sounds like fun.
[313:57.18]Add to the list.
[313:59.24]But thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.
[314:00.59]Yes, the answer is yes.
[314:01.41]I do still want to do that.
