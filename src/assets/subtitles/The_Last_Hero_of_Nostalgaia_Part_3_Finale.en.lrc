[00:20.95]How's it going?
[00:27.97]Yeah, I was going to do it tomorrow.
[00:29.91]It's going to be live tomorrow, but eh.
[00:33.70]It was on the brain.
[00:34.32]Just figured I'd finish it tonight.
[00:37.32]Probably not going to be a very long stream, but I'm into this.
[00:41.00]I want to play it and I want to finish it.
[00:43.54]Reverse delay.
[00:44.86]Sometimes it happens.
[00:45.48]Well, it's actually been happening a lot more frequently.
[00:53.44]Yeah, it's supposed to be tomorrow, but yeah, whatever.
[00:55.65]Let's go.
[01:00.81]I imagine there's probably only another hour or two left in the game, so why not?
[01:06.55]You got a Tom Hanks voice today?
[01:08.23]No, I don't.
[01:10.43]I do not.
[01:12.41]Whatever.
[01:12.69]I don't care.
[01:19.77]I fell asleep during your last stream.
[01:23.71]I'm glad you could relax.
[01:24.77]It's not an insult.
[01:34.78]I don't know if it was meant to be, but that means you were relaxed.
[01:40.58]That's fine with me.
[01:50.73]Remember when you lectured pre-stream chat about Key?
[01:55.43]What?
[02:00.33]I feel like I've lectured pre-stream chat about a bunch of random subjects.
[02:14.47]I feel like I get in there sometimes and I just kind of write.
[02:18.07]I honestly, sometimes I know.
[02:21.61]Okay, here we go.
[02:22.39]Here comes the beast going to break the magic.
[02:24.65]Sometimes when I'm in pre-stream chat, I feel like I have the Bugleberry mask on.
[02:28.92]You know what I mean?
[02:29.50]Like I just kind of, I can, it's just, I can just say anything.
[02:32.74]I don't know something about it.
[02:35.32]It's only like in pre-stream that I just, oh, the grilled cheese hit the floor kind of stuff.
[02:39.34]Like I don't even like, it's just whatever.
[02:44.52]mask mask mask I mean sometimes I put the Bugleberry mask on because well I I you know I I've whatever Santa isn't real okay sorry it's been your parents the whole time
[03:13.02]Bro, what the fuck?
[03:19.04]Bugleberry is my parents?
[03:25.92]Take that back.
[03:31.84]How could I possibly say Santa isn't real when Santa was on my stream a couple months ago?
[03:37.00]You guys can't be serious.
[03:45.76]Who was that then?
[03:53.43]Yeah, when... Alright, let's get started.
[04:01.68]500,000 bugs watching today.
[04:03.50]That's a lot.
[04:03.92]That's a huge viewership, damn.
[04:11.40]Why you like this?
[04:13.45]I don't know.
[04:13.93]Because I like having fun.
[04:16.41]It's really all I care about.
[04:17.37]Like, the only thing I care about.
[04:18.51]Sometimes I make my own fun.
[04:21.91]You know what I mean?
[04:29.73]You ever play Brutal Legends?
[04:31.00]No, but it looks fun.
[04:40.08]I always saw... I saw it kind of always on the shelf.
[04:47.88]Like, oh, cool.
[04:48.80]I never really played it.
[04:50.34]Seemed like a cool concept.
[04:53.84]Yeah, let's finish this.
[04:55.76]I don't know.
[04:56.80]There's no time limit on this stream, but there's no time frame.
[05:00.93]It's just I'm going to go until I beat it, and then we'll see.
[05:06.27]Finish Hollow Knight.
[05:06.97]Yeah, probably.
[05:07.79]You're going to stream more than three times this week.
[05:19.27]Um, well, technically, this is the end of a week.
[05:24.85]It is currently Saturday evening.
[05:28.15]So, the answer to that question, I believe, is no.
[05:32.97]So, not this week.
[05:37.66]Sunday is the only... I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[05:41.06]Instead of streaming this tomorrow, I'm streaming this today.
[05:43.14]Let's do four streams in a row.
[05:45.62]I mean, maybe I will at some point.
[05:52.64]It's in the middle of the night on Sunday.
[05:53.98]Well, yeah, it could be anywhere for anybody.
[06:01.76]How am I supposed to do any work if you keep streaming, you shithead?
[06:05.27]I don't know.
[06:10.71]Maybe just maybe do the things you need to do.
[06:13.87]Hey, I'm going to be here.
[06:23.84]Go do the things you need to do and then you come back when you're ready.
[06:28.92]Hey, that's not on me.
[06:31.14]It's not on me.
[06:31.74]Alright, let's go.
[06:43.09]And the good thing about this time rather than last night is I know exactly where I am because we beat a boss and I immediately stopped the stream.
[06:54.01]You don't get it.
[06:54.61]It's not that simple.
[06:59.39]You know, you kids, you kids don't understand.
[07:08.11]Back a long time ago, if there was a television show on TV and you missed it,
[07:18.15]You didn't get to go back.
[07:20.04]You had to catch it when it was on.
[07:21.86]Or wait till they released the fucking DVD.
[07:26.92]Like seven months later.
[07:29.70]You don't understand how easy you have it.
[07:32.94]All content is available.
[07:36.78]You have no idea.
[07:39.48]It's called a VCR.
[07:40.52]You could tape it.
[07:43.59]But what if you don't have a tape?
[07:47.45]What if you have, like, a box full of tapes?
[07:51.73]And what if you ran out?
[07:52.92]What if you're just like, I don't... What if you don't feel like putting a tape in and hitting record?
[07:58.50]What if you missed it?
[07:59.32]What if you... I know, like, oh, I'm just going to record because I know it's going to be on.
[08:04.64]A tape could only record 60 to 90 minutes.
[08:07.96]You couldn't go to work and record something.
[08:12.37]The tape was only, like, 60 minutes.
[08:17.44]Nice villain monolog.
[08:18.84]You have no idea.
[08:23.84]The point of this initial monolog is to tell you you can just watch the VOD.
[08:34.23]Although it's not ideal, because you can't say, when I do something.
[08:41.11]I get it.
[08:41.79]I do.
[08:44.90]Uh, TL;DR, time that person off for five seconds.
[08:48.17]Let's go.
[09:04.10]Alright, this is like fucked, this is like a fucked up comment, but I have to read it because it's actually, it's just so, I have to read it.
[09:11.81]They say, what do they say?
[09:13.47]It was, where is it?
[09:14.65]I want to get it right.
[09:17.31]No, I need to be in sync with your breathing.
[09:20.61]Alright, you know, time that person out for five seconds too.
[09:28.65]That is a weird comment.
[09:36.88]How come my controller doesn't work?
[09:51.15]Um, hello?
[09:52.65]How come I can't?
[09:53.12]There we go.
[09:56.62]Alright, so the last thing we did... Yep, I beat that boss.
[10:00.68]We got to the new area, and I am precisely where I want to be, lined up
[10:13.84]Lined up perfectly with where I want to go.
[10:16.60]Nice armor.
[10:19.29]Thanks.
[10:19.51]Oh my god.
[10:20.47]Okay, I didn't... Wait.
[10:30.47]Start over.
[10:30.81]There we go.
[10:33.63]The audio is low for me.
[10:37.95]Yeah, this is Bloodborne.
[10:39.53]This is supposed to be Bloodborne.
[10:46.68]This is great.
[10:49.09]Where's the beetle cam?
[10:51.57]I don't have the beetles yet.
[10:56.01]Notice how I said yet.
[10:58.22]That decision has been locked in.
[11:08.81]Yeah, so for those that don't know, I...
[11:14.09]It's so funny how your opinions and your life kind of changes and the way you see the world changes as you get a little older.
[11:21.11]I never thought I was going to care about bugs.
[11:23.68]Bugs?
[11:23.96]Ah, bugs!
[11:24.62]Who cares?
[11:25.04]Like, when I was younger?
[11:25.82]No.
[11:26.16]Not even close.
[11:29.68]They kind of, like, fascinate me now.
[11:31.30]It's interesting.
[11:32.08]It's weird how it's like, oh yeah, I didn't care at all until, like, literally this last year.
[11:40.85]Jesus.
[11:48.73]Die.
[11:49.27]Okay.
[11:55.32]But anyways, the... I've talked about it a couple weeks ago or so, whatever it was.
[12:01.28]But blue death-feigning beetles.
[12:05.29]They just look... They're so cool looking.
[12:07.11]And they're just so... They're just like silly.
[12:08.61]They're just silly little friends.
[12:15.04]And they can live a very, very, very long time.
[12:18.32]They don't take a whole lot of maintenance.
[12:19.42]And they seem kind of cool.
[12:20.44]Just like a thing to do.
[12:30.57]It's a fascinating world.
[12:34.57]And sometimes I kind of want to... I'd like to experience it.
[12:38.27]Right?
[12:38.81]That's pretty much all there is to it.
[12:48.98]The Dead Space remake is... Jesus Christ.
[12:54.38]Hold on.
[12:55.14]I'm dead.
[12:55.82]I'm dead.
[13:02.39]Alright, these things are no joke.
[13:15.29]Jesus Christ is in dead space.
[13:22.91]Do you know what I keep laughing at?
[13:25.79]I need some opinions.
[13:28.27]I need some chat opinions.
[13:30.74]So, Wild Hearts last night.
[13:34.94]The pig talking clip is just living in my head rent-free.
[13:38.88]I just keep thinking about it.
[13:46.03]something, I don't know why I thought it was so funny, but, um, so part of that sponsor is, um, I'm gonna be tweeting out a clip from the stream, and they were just like, yeah, pick any, like, any, like, fun clip, doesn't matter, like, whatever it is, as long as it's, like, fun or interesting, and I kind of want to use that.
[14:05.39]I think that that's, I think that's fucking hilarious.
[14:18.85]Do you think that would... Do you think that goes hard?
[14:21.23]I think it does.
[14:21.75]Yeah.
[14:30.97]Okay.
[14:35.30]Yeah, because I was thinking about it.
[14:36.26]I was like, maybe it should be that, because I don't know.
[14:38.26]Whatever.
[14:38.56]Oh my... Okay, these are the hardest enemies in the game.
[14:45.19]I can't.
[14:45.45]I gotta... Jesus.
[14:47.33]I'm dead again.
[14:47.73]I lost 10,000 souls.
[14:52.67]Yeah, or that falling... Yeah.
[14:55.57]So there's the other one when I have the hammer.
[14:57.27]And I'm going down the zipline.
[14:59.53]And I perfectly time it.
[15:01.59]So I'm about to land.
[15:03.31]One, two, three, four, five.
[15:04.99]Spinning with the hammer.
[15:06.75]And I just land and die.
[15:07.83]And then Vinny dies right next to me.
[15:12.11]You can see, maybe people didn't pick up on that.
[15:15.56]Or if you did, then you did.
[15:16.90]But Vinny literally at the end of that part falls right next to me in the same spot and dies.
[15:23.62]Holy shit.
[15:24.52]Hold on.
[15:25.98]Oh my god.
[15:26.62]Uh, run a pole?
[15:32.21]I mean, there also was kind of a cool gameplay moment where I did the bulwark, boom, timed it perfectly, and then did a huge jumping splash.
[15:41.80]Alright, let's get a poll.
[15:42.88]I'm curious.
[15:44.98]Uh, cool bulwark into jumping slash, the pig talks, or falling with the hammer.
[15:54.44]I mean, there's no way the gameplay one's gonna win, which, but I mean, we have to put it there.
[16:01.27]The pig is gonna be 80%.
[16:03.65]I don't know, the other one was pretty good too.
[16:19.86]You know what it is?
[16:20.46]These guys don't get staggered when you hit them.
[16:28.03]Oh, these are unbearable.
[16:30.95]Could you do all three?
[16:31.73]Um... Probably?
[16:51.22]Can you show the clips?
[16:53.56]Um... I think it's... I think it's pretty much not even close.
[16:59.67]I don't think we need to do that, judging by what this looks like so far.
[17:05.57]Looks like, uh... Yeah.
[17:11.17]Yeah.
[17:18.67]Appreciate it.
[17:21.95]83%, damn.
[17:32.48]Pig sweep.
[17:33.20]Alright, don't lose here, because one comes from... Yeah, one runs behind you.
[17:48.00]Oh, jeez.
[17:51.83]Oh my goodness, please do not.
[17:54.47]No, no, no, no!
[17:57.47]Oh, this area is fucking hard.
[17:59.23]Okay, both headphones are going in now.
[18:06.82]Both headphones going in.
[18:13.18]I wonder if I could... Maybe it's better to parry this.
[18:15.40]Do you think?
[18:24.93]Probably, right?
[18:26.93]With relentless enemies like this, I think the play is always to try to parry.
[18:30.63]Like the first attack.
[18:31.35]Is this a parry shield?
[18:34.83]Okay, this is a parry shield.
[18:41.05]It's in the wrong hand, but it's better than... Alright, here we go.
[18:45.13]Let's try it again.
[18:45.56]Let's see if it works.
[18:58.70]Jesus Christ, I'm dead.
[19:03.46]Well, definitely got harder.
[19:07.83]Let me try this again.
[19:34.30]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[19:35.64]Fuck!
[19:43.83]It's hard to do that.
[19:45.35]It's actually very difficult.
[19:59.36]What about blocking?
[20:02.02]Ooh, that person's got the right idea.
[20:10.15]I'm going to be fat rolling, but it doesn't matter.
[20:11.59]That person's got it.
[20:12.25]Oh.
[20:35.14]Oh, my God, I hate these guys.
[20:41.53]Hey, VOD watchers, skip 15 minutes.
[20:43.39]No, uh-uh.
[20:45.08]You don't know anything.
[20:46.02]What if that ends up being five minutes, and that person listened to you, and you were wrong?
[20:50.28]They're going to be very upset with you.
[20:52.06]Because they're about to... You know what?
[20:55.84]551.
[20:56.14]551.
[20:56.16]601.
[20:56.18]64... Okay, 614.
[21:10.83]I hope they did skip 15 minutes.
[21:12.69]Because it's 6.14.
[21:13.24]There's going to be something really cool that happens.
[21:15.76]I'm going to make sure of it.
[21:18.23]Exactly when it hits 6.14.
[21:35.37]reusing this bit.
[21:36.95]I loved this bit.
[21:38.81]I was just going to bring it up.
[21:40.03]You guys remember the SpongeBob VOD treasure hunt?
[21:44.51]A lot of time went into that one.
[21:59.45]Jesus, I can't do it.
[22:01.28]I can't do it.
[22:11.55]I have a better idea.
[22:14.03]Eight Endurance Andy.
[22:17.89]I got a better idea.
[22:27.08]Okay.
[22:35.08]Give me the shit I had already.
[22:36.06]Where is it?
[22:43.25]I have a new strategy.
[23:05.54]Oh my god, I tried to pick up the item that was probably gonna be on the ground and I just reset that.
[23:20.90]I think we just gotta get lucky with the crits.
[23:22.68]Just go all in.
[23:23.52]Go for it.
[23:27.65]Just go all in and hope that like my 30% crit rate works.
[23:29.75]Okay.
[23:29.85]Okay.
[23:52.30]Alright, one at a time.
[23:55.84]I see you up there.
[23:59.24]Wanna play that game?
[23:59.94]That's fine.
[24:02.35]Come on.
[24:02.89]Yeah, yeah.
[24:04.37]What happened?
[24:04.93]What's going on?
[24:22.42]I just don't want two.
[24:23.82]What the?
[24:24.42]Oh my god.
[24:25.16]Shit.
[24:27.08]Alright, I gotta go in.
[24:39.67]It's three.
[24:43.47]Oh.
[24:48.24]God.
[24:48.66]Okay.
[24:48.78]Okay.
[24:52.01]The other one disappeared.
[24:52.69]We lucked out.
[24:53.35]Nope, you're right there.
[25:03.60]Lucked out.
[25:06.58]Lucked out on that one.
[25:07.50]Good.
[25:07.70]Alright, now you.
[25:08.68]You just gotta tank it.
[25:21.16]Your character looks like you got dressed out of a dumpster behind a Halloween store the day after Halloween.
[25:26.70]That was a good one.
[25:30.86]That was a leather jacket.
[25:37.59]Okay.
[25:39.29]Everything's going good.
[25:43.27]Explore down here first.
[25:54.47]Should I go up, maybe?
[25:54.89]I don't know.
[26:10.15]I think I can go backward-
[26:12.67]Ahhhhh!
[26:23.58]Dude, stop attacking for a second so I can attack you!
[26:26.12]It's just unfair.
[26:48.35]The devs knew what they were doing here, too.
[26:51.58]It's just one of them runs up from behind you and hits you like three times.
[26:54.98]The devs knew what they were doing here.
[26:56.40]Okay.
[27:15.46]I kind of want to go back, though.
[27:18.90]Specifically for that reason right there, first of all, that's a problem.
[27:22.80]And that person's already being annoying.
[27:24.26]Doesn't that just annoy you?
[27:29.20]It annoys me.
[27:29.73]I'm going to jump down in a second.
[27:32.15]I want to go up this way.
[27:33.43]Can I go up this way?
[27:41.79]What?
[27:44.68]Really?
[27:44.92]You're going to do this?
[27:51.39]Oh, I can break it.
[27:57.81]Unburden shield.
[28:10.02]OK, what is that shield?
[28:14.72]Unburdened.
[28:16.96]75.6001.
[28:17.89]That's a weird number.
[28:30.61]Big number.
[28:35.84]Blood of a Forgotten NPC.
[28:37.48]I haven't used any of these.
[28:39.72]I really should.
[28:40.26]I feel like the game's going to end in an hour.
[28:49.26]I do this with everything, though.
[28:55.87]It's all to drink and eat at the same time as the last boss.
[29:00.40]This is Resident Evil ruined an entire generation of gamers.
[29:05.30]It really did.
[29:05.74]You know how many fucking red herbs I didn't eat?
[29:15.92]Yeah, you know how many magnum ammo I carried for 40 hours of gameplay to shoot and miss 12 times at the last boss and maybe hit once, one of them?
[29:33.64]We gotta stop doing that.
[29:36.16]And you know what?
[29:37.12]I'm going to be the thing that I'm describing.
[29:38.94]You know what?
[29:39.32]Let's start now.
[29:40.52]I'm gonna start now.
[29:42.56]You know what?
[29:43.06]Let's start now, right?
[29:46.70]Increases item discovery.
[29:47.70]I'm using it.
[29:51.92]Let's go find something.
[30:09.63]Item?
[30:10.73]Nope.
[30:17.92]Item?
[30:23.59]Hurry up, this thing's gonna... I think it died.
[30:34.77]Item.
[30:35.87]Actually worked.
[30:44.11]Do I have coins?
[30:48.58]I used 40 coins last night.
[30:53.04]And I didn't keep them for the one part of the game that I needed to keep them for.
[30:58.91]Don't ever use any of these.
[31:00.31]Don't ever consume them.
[31:02.39]Don't ever.
[31:03.53]Always hold it to the very end.
[31:05.38]I just proved it.
[31:05.88]Because now there's a maze.
[31:17.66]What's that?
[31:22.70]Plus weapon degradation damage.
[31:26.21]Interesting.
[31:28.57]That's pretty cool.
[31:32.81]Maybe I should do it.
[31:33.65]It's right-handed though.
[31:35.90]I'm a... You know, it's kind of weird.
[31:40.92]I'm a lefty in this game.
[31:44.06]I've never played an RPG or any, like, FromSoftware.
[31:47.46]I've never been a lefty.
[31:48.88]I'm actually a lefty this whole time.
[31:50.06]Hmm.
[31:52.43]That's kind of cool.
[32:04.54]What about Zelda?
[32:06.74]Is Link?
[32:08.76]Link is left-handed in Breath of the Wild?
[32:13.46]No, right?
[32:14.71]Is he?
[32:18.35]Link is left-handed?
[32:23.57]In most Zelda games.
[32:31.18]Oh, in the Wii games, he's ambidextrous, but traditionally left-handed.
[32:35.84]Oh.
[32:39.02]Interesting.
[32:44.24]I'm sorry.
[32:45.18]I don't know why that scared me.
[32:51.39]I actually have to apologize for that.
[32:52.63]There was no reason to get scared by that.
[33:09.08]I'm gonna open my phone here, bro.
[33:22.53]Bro, I think I have the wrong address for the Halloween party.
[33:24.67]I'm fucking kind of freaking out right now.
[33:35.29]Good thing I'm left-handed.
[33:52.80]the opportunity for atonement.
[33:55.54]Turn from oppression.
[33:57.98]Abandon the pursuits that have cast you into degradation.
[34:02.49]Salvation waits.
[34:05.15]Fatality waits.
[34:07.65]Pain is a whisper from the Almighty.
[34:11.45]You have strayed.
[34:13.31]Embrace your pain.
[34:15.90]Seek your pain.
[34:18.02]Let your pain change you.
[34:29.90]Shut up!
[34:38.87]I hear an anvil.
[35:00.86]No, I was going to just say something.
[35:05.20]I want to just... No, I want to put my face into that and push the pins out.
[35:10.85]It's one of those toy things where you push all the little pins.
[35:14.25]They're like individual pins.
[35:16.75]You put your hand in it and it makes a mold of your hand.
[35:23.16]How many of you guys did that?
[35:29.19]How many people did the, like, put your hand, like, you know, put your face into it?
[35:37.64]This place was once a facade.
[35:39.36]We crafted decorative theatrical torture devices for the great ritual.
[35:43.52]We didn't want to hurt each other back then.
[35:45.16]That was your job.
[35:47.46]That's a millennial thing.
[35:48.44]I'm sorry, there's three of us talking right now.
[35:51.08]It's probably hard to pay attention.
[35:52.25]I can do more for you again, hero.
[35:55.21]The memories come back to me.
[36:06.76]Yeah, it was a little... It was like a weird... What was it like?
[36:10.88]What was that thing even called?
[36:17.68]It was a thing that you... It was a... Hundreds and hundreds of little, little nails, right?
[36:23.89]What was it called?
[36:25.19]It had a name.
[36:26.93]Pin thingy, yeah.
[36:30.77]It wasn't nails.
[36:31.41]No, it was like... It was little pins.
[36:34.64]They weren't sharp or anything.
[36:39.63]It might not have even had a name.
[36:46.19]Look at this.
[36:49.59]I need four fragment of tradition.
[36:52.25]Everything has a name.
[37:06.17]Pin art toy, apparently.
[37:08.73]Or it's a pin screen.
[37:11.58]Oh, okay, cool.
[37:15.70]Should I do damage or... I keep complaining about stamina.
[37:32.17]I don't think...
[37:34.00]Is that like a boomer thing?
[37:35.96]I feel like that's one of those toys that just never ends.
[37:47.62]It's a toy that is always available forever.
[37:52.66]Alright, let's go.
[37:58.38]Actually, I have enough.
[37:59.60]I feel like I'm talking during a movie, but hold on.
[38:09.30]I can't attack.
[38:09.90]Ah, I thought you were going to get me.
[38:13.94]Nope.
[38:14.74]Actually, wait a minute.
[38:17.01]Don't I...
[38:40.03]Oh, no.
[38:40.37]Okay.
[38:40.57]I thought I had one of those to get another charge of my flask thing.
[38:47.85]Fable of Glitch?
[38:59.52]What's that?
[39:12.03]Oh, it's for the, it's for the smith.
[39:14.49]Source damage.
[39:15.72]Damn it.
[39:16.26]Oh fuck, it's one of you.
[39:19.40]Nice.
[39:42.97]She talks more than you do.
[39:47.83]I'm supposed to be talking.
[39:55.00]Complaining... Well, not complaining.
[39:56.92]But, like, addressing a streamer talking too much is like addressing the fact that your hamburger has a meat patty on it.
[40:04.37]I just wanted the bun.
[40:12.63]Less talking.
[40:23.80]Ooh.
[40:26.66]What about a vegan burger?
[40:29.90]The patty.
[40:30.84]The patty in the middle.
[40:37.56]It's a chicken costume.
[40:43.22]What is this a reference to?
[40:44.40]What is this?
[40:45.90]Hotline Miami?
[40:49.41]That is what it is, isn't it?
[40:51.03]Yeah, that's cool.
[41:15.49]How can it be locked from both sides?
[41:17.13]I'm not going this way yet.
[41:23.31]It's called... Just unlock the door.
[41:25.33]This shit is locked from both sides.
[41:31.52]You are cloistered because you have sinned.
[41:43.48]Sin pixelates your flesh.
[41:46.51]Okay, I'm going to put a thing down here.
[41:49.46]No, in this one that says, not this one.
[41:55.86]And then down right here, I'm going to write this one.
[41:57.80]Salvation waits.
[42:00.48]Fatality waits.
[42:00.86]Pain is a whisper from the Lord.
[42:21.70]I gotta play it like Hotline Miami.
[42:28.91]And why is this thing stuck?
[42:43.50]And die a dozen times.
[42:44.98]I remember Hotline Miami too.
[42:52.22]That was, when I think about the most angry I've been on stream, on camera.
[42:56.76]Because let's be real.
[43:00.54]Like everybody knows, right?
[43:03.60]Getting angry on stream, I'm usually not.
[43:07.02]I'm usually, it's like, oh, whatever.
[43:08.92]I'm like annoyed for a second or it's like, oh, frustrating for a second.
[43:12.30]But I very rarely get actually upset, truly upset on.
[43:18.94]Whoa.
[43:21.21]Holy shit.
[43:24.26]Oh my god!
[43:25.24]That was unbelievably ridiculous.
[43:30.28]That last five to ten minutes, my heart is racing right now of how ridiculous that was.
[43:37.25]Guys, wasn't that the most craziest fucking thing you've ever seen on stream in your entire- ever, that I've ever done?
[43:44.07]Holy shit.
[43:47.75]Whoa.
[43:48.93]I'm speechless.
[43:50.03]I mean, I'm talking a lot, but I'm speechless.
[43:53.56]I really hope that nobody potentially skipped the last 15-ish minutes of the stream.
[43:59.01]That would be so, oh my, you would have missed something.
[44:01.23]I can't, I can't even describe it.
[44:06.34]I'm speechless right now.
[44:15.08]I just got here.
[44:17.40]Oh, oh, oh, but those of you that just got here, 15 minutes ago, somebody told somebody to skip 15 minutes.
[44:23.68]So I wanted to make everybody that did that and listen to that person question it.
[44:30.66]You missed it?
[44:31.50]What?
[44:33.42]It was 25 minutes ago?
[44:43.52]No, it hasn't.
[44:50.35]You calculated it wrong but LUL.
[44:53.46]I appreciate it.
[44:54.10]Thank you.
[44:55.98]I like the sympathy LUL.
[44:57.44]I appreciate it.
[45:24.60]Don't fall down that.
[45:33.85]Alright, I'm up here now.
[45:44.73]Boo!
[45:45.29]You suck!
[45:46.33]Say something else!
[46:23.94]Say something funny!
[46:33.42]He's being toxic.
[46:44.39]Okay, that's all I can do here.
[46:46.35]Let's drop down.
[46:53.85]I think there was another thing to do this way.
[47:00.82]Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[47:12.74]Yackety, yackety, yackety, yackety.
[47:14.32]Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[47:19.36]Okay, so the only way to go is up that way.
[47:30.07]I'm just checking to see if there's anything else to do.
[47:33.89]And it does not, so let's go.
[47:35.03]Okay.
[47:49.41]She's stun locked.
[48:05.18]Okay.
[48:07.40]I gotta go up and around.
[48:08.68]I went here, right?
[48:20.10]Okay, this is the only way to go.
[48:24.33]I can go down that hole.
[48:28.53]That's the only way to go, so we're gonna drop down.
[48:32.70]What's up?
[48:59.76]One hit.
[49:02.98]One hit!
[49:06.43]I must just turn the stream off after that.
[49:11.43]That just fucked me up so bad.
[49:13.21]Like...
[49:15.97]I was so pissed that I said that.
[49:19.14]And it actually fucked with my head.
[49:21.06]Fuck.
[49:27.14]I know where to go.
[49:39.07]If I held it for a little longer, I had a choice.
[49:43.89]Let me tell you what the choice was.
[49:47.24]I don't want to lose 17,000 souls, so hold on.
[49:54.16]I made a choice.
[49:56.61]The choice was hold it for a long time to make it actually make sense, or stop it immediately and pretend hopefully nobody notices.
[50:04.51]I chose probably not wisely.
[50:20.20]Get out of the way, get out of the way!
[50:29.68]I'm alright.
[50:33.37]Imagine if it was like... One hit!
[50:38.07]Why am I doing it again?
[50:53.86]Jesus Christ!
[50:57.00]That guy swung so many times in a row!
[50:59.58]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, I had that too.
[51:06.93]Oh my god.
[51:08.36]I'm not talking anymore for at least 10 minutes.
[51:13.40]Get off me.
[51:19.76]What is going on with this guy in the doorway?
[51:35.21]What was going on with the guy in the doorway?
[51:46.46]Okay.
[52:37.50]Do you like Revenge of the Sith?
[52:38.86]Yeah.
[52:59.92]Alright, we're good.
[53:07.13]What?
[53:43.79]Oh, green herb.
[53:44.23]Alright.
[53:44.59]Everything's good now.
[54:31.12]Wrongness.
[54:32.12]Extra item?
[54:34.26]Where is it?
[54:36.12]Stop.
[55:04.34]Alright, made it, finally.
[55:07.80]Yikes.
[55:12.62]Dungeon gate key, yup.
[55:17.13]I am not running through all this shit again.
[55:18.81]There's another one, where is it?
[55:27.19]Where is it?
[55:28.03]Is it down?
[55:36.29]Yeah, okay.
[55:36.96]That's much better.
[55:37.84]There's three of them.
[55:45.73]I think I'll be alright.
[55:47.17]You like dumb and dumber?
[55:50.27]Yeah.
[55:58.00]Yeah, you're not making me do that.
[56:16.19]You know one of these games I've played?
[56:21.34]Only the popular ones that are very agreeable to play.
[56:27.85]Dark Souls 3.
[56:29.29]Bloodborne.
[56:30.51]And Elden Ring.
[56:31.93]And Dark Souls 1.
[56:32.61]I haven't played any of the other ones.
[56:34.59]I've never played Dark Souls 2.
[56:47.18]Sekiro.
[56:47.60]I've played them all.
[57:04.98]Hey, do you like things?
[57:07.13]Depends on what that thing is.
[57:09.89]Okay, I gotta play this right.
[57:12.93]Dark Souls 2 is great, but different.
[57:34.82]Yeah, I mean, I played through the whole thing.
[57:38.02]Just didn't stream it.
[57:41.82]I'll be really honest with you guys.
[57:44.46]You would not have wanted to watch that.
[57:48.45]There's definitely at least three or four times.
[57:51.43]No, what am I talking about?
[57:52.31]There's probably three or four hundred times during my just solo, just sitting around playing Dark Souls 2 where I was insufferable.
[58:07.87]I probably would have lost like 50,000 followers if you had actually watched me play Dark Souls 2.
[58:16.23]People would be like, holy shit.
[58:18.94]I don't like this stream.
[58:22.18]He's being like, he's saying awful things.
[58:30.58]Why does he keep screaming fuck as loud as he can?
[58:33.53]He needs to stop doing that.
[58:37.65]I did not do that.
[58:39.07]I'm kidding That just hurts your voice
[58:55.95]Nobody would have wanted to watch that.
[58:57.77]Something amazing has spawned.
[59:01.03]No, not you, silly.
[59:03.03]Though you sure are swell.
[59:05.40]When your cycle started, an innocent, uncorrupted NPC also appeared.
[59:10.50]That hasn't happened for ages.
[59:14.44]Hey, I have a fun idea.
[59:16.81]How about you find them and bring them a little gift from me?
[59:22.25]An innocent wouldn't be able to stay innocent long in this messed up world.
[59:27.22]This guy's evil.
[59:48.08]Stop.
[59:48.30]I see a lot of people saying to do that.
[59:50.28]I mean, it's like, stop telling me to hit the pink guy.
[59:54.88]It's like, it was funny at first, but mods actually start timing people up for it.
[60:00.13]Holy fuck.
[60:02.41]Oh, that was the original title of the stream, by the way.
[60:04.17]I changed it last second.
[60:11.09]I think that's an instant kill move.
[60:28.02]Oh my goodness.
[60:28.56]Alright.
[60:29.48]I'm going to be honest.
[60:36.75]I don't think you are real.
[60:37.83]It's not personal.
[60:41.93]What is going on with that lately?
[60:44.49]Have you noticed that?
[60:46.29]What is with that?
[60:46.71]What is up with that?
[61:05.44]Bad stand-up.
[61:06.30]Where is this person?
[61:07.90]Salvation.
[61:55.49]Can you do the Turing test?
[61:56.55]Yep.
[61:56.75]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[61:57.35]My fair color is blue.
[62:17.76]And... Kinda like the alignment of the planets and shit.
[62:24.34]Like, Galileo figured it out.
[62:26.37]Uh... Oh, there's the train tracks with the five people and the one person.
[62:34.41]I have to decide, um... Interesting.
[62:48.82]No, I only say it... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[62:53.26]This is actually a fucking huge problem if I don't beat him.
[62:59.97]Thank God.
[63:00.51]Okay.
[63:03.05]I feel like I've been seeing a lot of that lately.
[63:07.33]Like, is he real thing?
[63:08.75]It's like, yeah, bro, I'm fucking real.
[63:10.87]Relax.
[63:12.51]This is embarrassing.
[63:14.29]Oh shit.
[63:15.84]I think I am to be civilized.
[63:19.75]Or some grim echo of that process.
[63:22.53]Whatever it involves, I don't really care to find out and I don't suspect it'll work.
[63:27.59]We've not spawned looking the way they want us to be rendered.
[63:30.96]But for better or worse, this is who I am.
[63:35.60]No torture can change that.
[63:37.40]It can only be torture.
[63:39.50]Please, if you can, find a way to mask what they hate to see of me before they tear me apart.
[63:45.74]Can I open the door?
[63:54.84]Why don't I just open the door?
[63:56.22]Can I open the door?
[63:57.50]Ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[64:02.20]Very important.
[64:13.65]You know, usually when you pick decks, decks is like the... There's only like probably two or three just straight up decks weapons in this game.
[64:23.41]I actually really like that.
[64:26.14]I went into this dumping all my points into decks and luck.
[64:32.11]But you could, there's a lot of, you could do like hybrid stuff.
[64:35.34]That's like the whole point.
[64:36.38]That's cool.
[64:37.66]I like it.
[64:43.27]What is this a reference to?
[64:59.74]Bloodborne?
[65:01.68]Vampire boss.
[65:03.24]That's not Bloodborne.
[65:06.60]Castlevania.
[65:07.16]That's probably more likely.
[65:09.37]Yeah, Castlevania.
[65:11.71]Alright, so...
[65:30.81]Okay.
[65:43.66]Your kind once upheld all worth saving.
[65:47.80]They ushered change to that worth changing.
[65:51.31]It was not always their own wills they served.
[66:01.85]Oh.
[66:04.19]Keep of the stolen crown.
[66:05.69]Five of your relics.
[66:06.89]Come on.
[66:18.43]Nothing here.
[66:23.37]Ooh, this place is cool.
[66:30.42]Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin is the best FromSoftware game, bar none.
[66:36.57]It's hard to do that after Elden Ring comes out.
[66:39.85]Because, you know, I think Elden Ring, it's hard to put that on the FromSoftware tier list.
[66:45.79]Because it's kind of every single FromSoftware game in the same game.
[66:49.79]It's every single one of them together.
[66:52.43]So it's kind of like hard to put it somewhere.
[67:12.54]Have you found him?
[67:13.74]Have you found the king?
[67:15.42]Oh.
[67:16.38]Not yet.
[67:16.84]Oh, wait.
[67:18.42]I find... Okay.
[67:19.52]My heart is pounding.
[67:23.41]My heart is pounding.
[67:24.89]My heart is pounding.
[67:26.61]My heart is pounding.
[67:34.05]I did that because that would be fucking crazy to see somebody do that.
[67:40.31]You'd be like, holy shit, this person is the real deal.
[67:42.78]Nobody moves like that.
[67:43.58]You'd be like, whoa.
[67:48.52]Alright, I'm taking this person way more seriously now.
[68:01.09]Shortcut.
[68:03.25]To where?
[68:10.12]Unlocked elsewhere?
[68:11.32]Come on, really?
[68:12.12]I guess I'm going to keep going.
[68:33.49]Oh no.
[68:37.87]I'm going to cheese this fight.
[68:38.71]I don't want to die here.
[68:48.49]Help!
[68:49.63]Get me out of here.
[68:51.41]Wait, this is perfect.
[68:55.96]This is actually perfect.
[68:58.70]There's no way his AI pathing is gonna get this right.
[69:02.20]Considering where he currently is stuck.
[69:23.59]What are you doing?
[69:30.18]Can he not come in this room?
[69:51.77]Oh my god!
[69:52.23]I thought he died!
[69:52.73]I thought he was dead.
[69:53.79]I heard the explosion.
[70:05.78]Anti-hero uptight ass kick.
[70:07.84]What?
[70:14.06]Cobbled leggings that defy the establishment.
[70:20.62]That's where I'm on.
[70:37.67]Valiant hero.
[70:42.11]Really?
[70:46.67]They're not all blocked, are they?
[70:49.79]It's just a mess.
[70:59.25]Rooting Voice Potion.
[71:06.10]Elden Ring is better than Bloodborne.
[71:09.64]Yeah, but it's kind of...
[71:14.79]It's in Elden Ring.
[71:16.17]Bloodborne is in Elden Ring.
[71:19.03]They all won.
[71:19.55]That's a bad take.
[71:41.20]I mean, I don't think it is.
[71:44.01]Also, this whole catalog spans, like, 15 years at this point.
[71:50.76]And it's, they're very similar games.
[71:56.40]That's why, I mean, it's hard to do it, because think about it.
[71:58.46]Think of, like, Super Mario Brothers.
[72:02.22]And then think of, look at Mario Odyssey.
[72:03.90]It's like, those are both really great for their own reasons, but Mario Odyssey kind of is...
[72:09.44]It's great, but I mean, but Super Mario Brothers is... It's so good.
[72:13.18]It's so classic.
[72:14.08]It's hard to do that.
[72:18.78]Is Mario Odyssey objectively a better video game than Super Mario Brothers?
[72:25.42]Like, what do you think?
[72:26.76]The answer is, like, probably yes.
[72:29.87]Right?
[72:31.99]But it's hard to say that Super Mario... Oh, what's the best Super Mario game?
[72:37.89]Oh, Super Mario Brothers, of course, the original.
[72:39.77]It started it all, the classic.
[72:41.17]Is it a better video game than Mario Odyssey?
[72:45.29]That's, that's, you can't, it's hard to do that.
[72:46.99]You can't do that.
[72:47.45]They're in the same, they're the same franchise, same developers.
[72:52.91]So, well, for the most part, right?
[72:54.39]Or at least, um, somewhat.
[72:57.77]Mario's been around for a little bit longer.
[73:11.55]I just play games and like them.
[73:15.66]That's a good take.
[73:18.84]You know what?
[73:20.50]That's a great take.
[73:21.38]Alright, let's not mess this up.
[73:37.10]Not this...
[73:51.00]Gigachad, I'm a gamer.
[74:07.69]It's kind of cool that there's so many different genres of game.
[74:13.61]They fill up so many different niches.
[74:19.94]A lot.
[74:20.98]Super Mario World is probably the best.
[74:23.22]I would probably agree with that.
[74:24.16]It kind of sits right at that spot.
[74:34.73]Philosophy Andy?
[74:41.58]Yeah, but whatever.
[74:47.69]Oh, hold on a second.
[74:48.63]I want to see this.
[74:49.35]That's... Street Fighter.
[74:53.16]Metroid.
[74:55.70]Zelda.
[74:59.40]Um... I don't know who that is.
[75:07.05]That's... Peg Ganon.
[75:09.99]Dr. Robotnik.
[75:10.77]Diablo?
[75:13.21]Diablo?
[75:16.45]Who's that up there?
[75:17.13]Is that... Is that Carmen Sandiego?
[75:20.03]Okay, Carmen Sandiego?
[75:23.95]The... The Madman from... Mega Man?
[75:30.09]Uh... Who's up top?
[75:32.58]Who is that?
[75:33.04]Freddy?
[75:41.22]Freddy?
[75:45.46]No, that's not Freddy Krueger.
[75:48.11]Is it supposed to be Wario?
[75:50.65]Alright, what about over here?
[75:54.65]I think that's it.
[76:07.82]This river of blood is interesting.
[76:18.66]I don't know what that was.
[76:23.08]Hero Stumper.
[76:24.16]It's a chainsaw.
[76:30.15]It's a dex weapon.
[76:32.55]It's a pure dex weapon.
[76:47.08]What?
[76:47.46]This is not what I thought this was.
[76:49.26]I thought it was just... I thought it was a chainsaw.
[76:52.97]It's a chainsaw on a stick.
[76:57.43]I was imagining it was going to be just a chainsaw.
[77:15.95]It's a thrust weapon, but I don't have anything much better.
[77:19.13]I'm going to upgrade this.
[77:22.89]How is it with it in my offhand?
[77:24.05]I actually kind of like it.
[77:28.20]I don't know what that is, but... Weird.
[77:44.81]These things don't explode, right?
[77:49.49]Whoops.
[78:05.44]It's a comedy weapon.
[78:07.82]It's one of the few pure deck scaling weapons I've found in the game so far, so it's a weapon for me.
[78:25.34]Who's that?
[78:46.11]Bowser?
[78:49.13]Maybe it's supposed to be Bowser.
[79:01.36]Who?
[79:06.34]Cool.
[79:08.46]Wait, I did.
[79:09.55]I see in chat on the right straight ahead.
[79:12.13]Who is that?
[79:12.51]I couldn't.
[79:14.71]I didn't figure out who that was.
[79:24.04]He man.
[79:57.40]Sephiroth.
[80:17.91]Nostalgaia once loved you.
[80:20.65]Loved heroes, I mean.
[80:22.49]But you betrayed us.
[80:25.07]The betrayal of heroes, I mean.
[80:28.13]What does it do?
[80:51.31]Oh source.
[81:13.35]No!
[81:15.79]How am I- I've got a billion souls right now.
[81:21.71]I have a billion.
[81:24.67]I don't want to die.
[81:25.42]Do you throw stuff?
[81:38.78]Uh-oh.
[81:40.56]Uh-oh.
[81:42.49]Uh oh.
[81:44.97]Uh oh.
[81:46.97]Uh oh!
[81:54.98]Oh, come on!
[82:13.29]I'm just going to back off.
[82:16.49]Where is that one down here?
[82:21.85]Get away from me.
[82:27.88]Hardcore pill.
[82:28.84]We're going to cheese this too?
[82:37.01]No.
[82:37.31]Yeah, we are.
[82:43.35]Do it again.
[82:53.32]Keep it hardcore!
[82:55.74]Keep it hardcore!
[82:57.30]Come on, do it!
[82:58.52]Come on, do it!
[83:02.21]I might be able to get him from here.
[83:07.67]I'm so paranoid about this.
[83:10.05]Thank God.
[83:12.44]I need a bonfire now.
[83:15.31]Ooh, that helps.
[83:17.11]That's also good.
[83:27.16]Okay.
[83:29.42]Drop down here.
[83:45.29]Fuck.
[83:45.79]Fuck.
[84:08.49]I don't give a shit.
[84:09.13]I don't give a shit.
[84:09.99]I don't give a shit.
[84:11.95]I don't care.
[84:12.35]I don't care.
[84:13.29]I don't care.
[84:14.03]I don't care.
[84:14.53]I don't care.
[84:15.23]I don't care.
[84:16.93]I don't care.
[84:17.79]I don't care.
[84:18.29]I don't care.
[84:19.05]Just don't care.
[84:19.97]And I go... I just don't care.
[84:23.77]And that's how I'm going to get through it.
[84:27.42]I literally don't care.
[84:29.58]See?
[84:44.68]I don't care.
[84:45.92]Literally.
[84:48.56]Figuratively.
[84:49.20]I just don't care.
[84:52.54]See?
[84:56.80]I don't even care.
[85:11.42]This is a bad place to be.
[85:24.07]I didn't want to come in here, but I have to stay in here now.
[85:27.40]We have to stay in here.
[85:37.65]I'm not doing it on purpose.
[85:39.95]There's nowhere for me to go.
[85:41.41]Dude, why is this so far away?
[86:01.26]Whoa.
[86:15.97]Ooh.
[86:17.48]Oh.
[86:25.46]You are cloistered because you have sinned.
[86:29.42]Nice.
[86:34.17]Nice.
[86:37.59]Alright, that's even quicker.
[87:00.30]We're good.
[87:00.70]We're good.
[87:02.80]We're good.
[87:03.40]We're good.
[87:08.81]I remember this.
[87:09.45]Hello.
[87:12.57]I'll be back later.
[87:13.45]Okay.
[87:24.06]I'm back.
[87:27.08]Now where is there a bonfire?
[87:34.55]It has to be one, right?
[87:36.26]Did I just miss it completely?
[87:37.66]Go get your souls, dude.
[87:47.65]I don't know where I am.
[87:50.35]I don't know where I am.
[87:51.27]I don't know where to go.
[87:51.87]I don't know where I am.
[87:58.04]I don't remember this.
[87:58.70]I don't know where I am.
[87:59.50]I don't remember this.
[88:05.23]I actually need to slow down though because... Yeah, I am not gonna lose here.
[88:23.34]Oh no.
[88:24.30]Just jumped a hundred feet in the air.
[88:31.52]Give me a crit, please!
[88:42.54]You never know who's gonna run up the stairs.
[88:44.00]I have to be ready.
[89:05.60]What?
[89:12.52]Oh!
[89:13.00]Oh!
[89:45.98]Alright, so now where?
[89:47.30]I know where the my souls are.
[90:04.23]Power Star.
[90:04.87]Oh, because it's Super Mario.
[90:51.09]I don't want to aggro that thing.
[91:08.56]That's dumb.
[91:20.38]That's what I was waiting to have happen.
[91:32.05]But no, wait.
[91:32.61]I need... Hold on.
[91:33.45]No, no, no.
[91:33.81]I want that item.
[91:42.80]Something up there.
[91:47.92]Right?
[91:48.21]Like up and to the left?
[91:51.42]I have to get the... My souls are over there in front of that door.
[92:00.23]I think I have to go this way.
[92:02.07]Or else I won't be able to get my souls back.
[92:06.17]Yeah.
[92:06.33]I'll come back.
[92:16.22]No, yeah, fuck this.
[92:17.06]I'm out of here.
[92:37.82]Where does this go?
[92:54.15]Oh my...
[93:13.44]Okay.
[93:14.10]Um, sure.
[93:15.52]I guess I'll do that.
[93:37.93]Be careful here.
[93:40.29]Loot?
[93:40.85]Heroes loot.
[93:43.68]Cool.
[93:45.22]Uh, alright.
[93:45.80]Hold on a minute.
[93:48.70]Let's not get too weird about this.
[93:57.29]Follow me all the way down here, please.
[93:58.63]Don't shoot!
[94:00.14]Nice aim.
[94:02.24]That's ridiculous.
[94:23.29]What does this do?
[94:43.87]Get the shit away from me!
[94:45.63]This gas!
[94:46.51]What the hell?
[95:06.76]Oh my goodness.
[95:08.12]Get off the screen.
[95:08.76]Get off the screen.
[95:09.76]Get off my screen.
[95:10.90]Get off my screen.
[95:14.52]Get off my screen.
[95:15.20]Get off my screen.
[95:17.78]Get off my screen.
[95:27.96]Alright.
[95:28.62]I need to figure out how to... Um...
[95:50.64]Don't.
[95:53.74]What's running?
[96:06.15]That was a weird sound.
[96:28.60]It sounds like you just got tased.
[96:32.62]God damn it.
[96:33.46]There's not that much left.
[96:34.72]Just be careful.
[96:36.33]I got it.
[96:49.94]Fuck!
[96:51.48]No!
[96:52.36]It's so difficult.
[96:53.73]I didn't know where to go.
[96:54.83]I fell down and lost my fucking soul.
[97:00.21]I fell accidentally two deaths ago, and I thought I had enough health, and then I... God damn it.
[97:09.98]I don't even know where to go.
[97:19.76]What's with your laughs today?
[97:21.18]They're very goofy.
[97:24.58]Fuck, this place sucks.
[97:29.02]I don't even care.
[97:29.42]I'm just running.
[97:30.80]I don't care.
[97:31.14]Hit me again.
[97:31.78]I don't care.
[97:34.24]I am just running to the exit.
[98:11.55]Get down here.
[98:12.93]I'm killing everything.
[98:13.65]Okay, no more Mr. Nightstreamer.
[98:24.75]Alright, I just... I'm fucking pissed.
[98:40.43]You are cloistered.
[98:43.36]It's so far away.
[98:45.88]You're missing the bonfire?
[98:47.66]Where is it?
[98:50.54]You mean to tell me there was a bonfire there the whole time and I just didn't find it?
[98:53.85]Where the hell is it?
[98:59.47]It's outside the castle.
[99:05.89]Didn't I go out there?
[99:06.73]What do you mean it's outside?
[99:33.00]So is it the room with the blood?
[99:34.48]It's to the left.
[99:35.02]Let me check outside, though.
[99:43.37]If there's one sitting right here, I am going to be very, very mad.
[100:02.73]Yeah, but this one, I mean, there's technically a bonfire here, but it's not connected to anything.
[100:17.21]God damn it.
[100:29.28]Oh, that stinks.
[100:36.34]Oh, man.
[100:37.32]I just saw a big circle.
[100:44.63]I thought you were just standing here.
[100:48.05]And I think I didn't.
[100:49.97]Oh, that's I'm sad.
[100:51.23]I'm sad.
[101:02.55]It was right in front of me too.
[101:05.07]It was right there.
[101:06.83]Running around going, how do I get out of here?
[101:08.39]Where do I go?
[101:09.91]Help, I have 30,000 souls.
[101:11.11]It was right there the whole time.
[101:14.19]Shucks.
[101:16.29]I need new gear.
[101:17.67]You know what I mean?
[101:31.32]Is this Dark Souls?
[101:44.58]hmm I'm thinking skull head I'm thinking yep that's cool oven mitts either boxers or the bone legs actually I like that too yep how am I fat rolling really this stuff doesn't weigh anything
[102:12.80]Alright.
[102:14.32]I think that's better.
[102:15.10]I don't know.
[102:21.21]Take my time again.
[102:31.16]Sands.
[102:51.34]Sea is a skeleton.
[102:52.92]Sands.
[102:57.70]Now don't waste these now.
[103:01.81]Incomprehensible drip.
[103:17.87]Alright, what kind of weapon is this?
[103:20.29]It follows you up and down stairs.
[103:23.78]I mean, I've heard of homing missiles before, but that's another- I'm just- I don't even- I'm running.
[103:46.02]What's up, dude?
[104:28.58]If only I was locked on and I wasn't for some reason.
[104:33.26]I'm gonna puke.
[104:37.46]Anything glowing here?
[104:39.78]Wait.
[104:41.86]Oh, it's a source weapon.
[104:43.02]I don't have enough memory.
[104:47.72]Anything else?
[104:57.23]I can definitely get there.
[104:58.27]6,000, right?
[105:04.24]That's not going to be enough.
[105:13.70]Alright, let's see what it is.
[105:38.77]What about the lore?
[105:41.27]An out-of-place blade that harnesses glitch.
[105:47.21]What's this from?
[105:47.69]CSGO?
[106:13.34]Haunted thoughts.
[106:17.60]New helmet.
[106:27.52]Not fat rolling.
[106:32.25]Alright, that's where... I'm not gonna die going down here.
[106:40.09]But that's not where I need to go.
[106:41.17]I need to move this over.
[106:50.56]This has to move.
[106:53.06]Where's the room to... I'm killing you because you're just going to be a pain in the ass.
[106:59.45]Okay, you have a two swing pattern.
[107:20.58]That was weird and you know it.
[107:25.56]Alright, that was weird.
[107:27.97]Where did this guy come from?
[107:29.29]I have to get this little shit out of here.
[107:58.73]No, don't deep Nice
[108:32.08]God, do you cast your magical bullshit.
[108:34.36]God, cast your magical bullshit.
[108:47.62]No one cares.
[108:58.55]You make the weirdest sounds.
[108:59.67]There's a lot of air.
[109:01.83]A lot of air comes out of my esophagus.
[109:15.80]A lot of air just kind of shoots out.
[109:18.28]Has nowhere to go.
[109:24.15]OK, how do I get over there?
[109:26.64]I don't know.
[109:29.91]How do I get over there?
[109:54.75]I have to go down.
[110:20.28]So if I pull...
[110:23.38]That one, will that do it?
[110:25.34]I don't think I had very many souls anyways.
[110:53.84]No.
[110:55.24]I have to... Dude, it's so stressful when you've got these lizard people casting these weird spells.
[111:06.14]Alright, so... Go over here and then... I think I did it wrong.
[111:22.21]I don't...
[111:23.66]There's too many things to look at.
[111:26.04]I don't know.
[111:26.36]I feel like it's the other one.
[111:28.98]Does the... I have to get up there?
[112:04.35]And then... I don't know.
[112:08.19]They don't know what to do.
[112:09.19]I think I haven't been here yet.
[112:28.09]Oh!
[112:28.19]I don't want to fall off the fucking edge.
[112:32.47]Give me a safe spot.
[112:59.39]I have to commit.
[112:59.97]I have to commit.
[113:00.51]I have to commit.
[113:01.06]I have to commit.
[113:02.24]That's why you commit.
[113:02.94]I don't have any heals left.
[113:26.50]Oh, my heart hurts.
[113:31.26]I'm not even up there either.
[113:32.76]There's probably a dozen more enemies before I can get where I need to go.
[113:37.24]This is not even correct.
[113:54.26]I gotta get up there and then around the corner.
[113:56.69]Um,
[114:39.01]That sucks.
[114:43.47]I don't even remember how to get up there.
[114:51.65]Oh, I don't... I don't... Is it all in the right spot still?
[114:54.80]I'm so sad.
[114:55.88]That's so... Oh, that sucks.
[115:04.66]What am I having to the reduced aggro range?
[115:06.50]That other guy didn't even see me.
[115:10.98]God.
[115:12.44]Oh, that stinks.
[115:14.16]I think I know where I'm going.
[115:16.10]I... See, I have this issue.
[115:21.57]When I'm under stress, I'm not committing anything to memory.
[115:25.67]So in my brain, this is all just a blank canvas with enemies attacking me.
[115:32.85]Right?
[115:33.13]My number one priority is not to remember what route to go.
[115:35.77]It's don't die to the thing trying to kill you.
[115:39.37]So it may as well just be a blank canvas.
[115:51.13]I think it's lined up already though.
[115:52.93]Yeah, I think so.
[115:58.96]I think I'm alright.
[116:03.92]And then through here.
[116:07.57]And then this way, get away from me.
[116:10.40]Okay.
[116:14.32]Thank God.
[116:15.70]If it reset, I'd be very sad.
[116:17.02]Okay.
[116:36.72]We're good.
[116:38.50]Things are going fine.
[116:42.28]I thought someone was behind me.
[116:55.94]Alright, you two pieces of shit.
[117:01.02]Come on.
[117:03.72]That thing is always like another second later.
[117:18.87]Blood of a blood of a blood of a blood?
[117:19.97]Alright, pull it.
[117:23.01]And then... Huh?
[117:48.77]Wait, how do I... Do I have anything that connects to that one?
[118:05.34]Will this one move and go over there?
[118:07.08]What happens if I pull it twice?
[118:13.14]Just go back to the original?
[118:21.16]Bro, it's right there.
[118:23.82]I don't want to make... Oh.
[118:28.53]I didn't want to make any decisions until I got a good view.
[118:30.49]Don't rush my decision making.
[118:55.46]Here we go.
[119:01.12]Really?
[119:09.60]Yep.
[119:27.97]Was there a lever?
[119:28.55]Did I just not see it?
[119:45.86]There's one there, but... I need to move this that way, but I could only move this that way if I go that way.
[119:52.94]Over there to the left.
[119:53.78]Pull this one to turn it, but I can't go that way unless I turn that one to go this way.
[119:57.59]So... Just jump?
[119:59.77]There's no jump in the game.
[120:04.77]There's no jump.
[120:05.27]Should I drop?
[120:08.61]No.
[120:15.93]I need to move that one.
[120:17.73]Can I get?
[120:18.97]No, I can't.
[120:19.73]Unless I drop down.
[120:31.80]That's the one I need to pull.
[120:34.28]So how do I get over there?
[120:37.64]Very clearly, it wants to move this one to here.
[120:42.40]But the only way I can physically do that is if... Hold on.
[120:56.59]and turn it back.
[121:00.71]He's so smart.
[121:21.23]I always fuck that move up.
[121:26.44]Alright.
[121:27.78]Let's go.
[121:28.40]Finally.
[121:28.78]There's the door.
[121:35.41]Line it up.
[121:35.89]Spin this shit around again.
[122:01.75]So now I can just run up the stairs?
[122:03.21]We're good?
[122:03.59]Move.
[122:07.20]What's your deal?
[122:11.74]Why are you always here?
[122:24.49]I told you to give my present to the innocent.
[122:27.18]Now he's been ruined by experiences thanks to you.
[122:30.92]How can I trust you again after breaking my heart?
[122:35.51]Suck it up, Reservoir.
[122:39.72]It's not my heart that matters, is it?
[122:42.04]The Great One in this keep had swell intentions.
[122:45.50]She wanted to remake the world like it used to be.
[122:48.48]But reversion is still transformation.
[122:51.63]It doesn't really matter that suffering can bring about change.
[122:55.01]The problem is that change brings about suffering.
[122:58.71]She made a boo-boo.
[123:00.55]Sound familiar?
[123:01.73]If you want to heal the heart that actually matters, unburden her.
[123:31.80]I'd like a checkpoint.
[123:35.82]Can I jump out the window?
[123:38.98]Aim stinks.
[123:49.91]Now we're in vampire land.
[124:01.99]Sure would be nice to have 50,000 souls right now.
[124:04.42]That'd be great.
[124:24.62]I feel like we're getting into the endgame.
[124:26.48]I'm wondering...
[124:35.47]30 dexterity.
[124:35.97]What's the new ability?
[124:52.42]Refill access on use.
[124:54.42]Refill access on use?
[124:57.84]What does this stuff even do?
[124:59.16]Refills access.
[125:01.30]What is access?
[125:05.61]I haven't even looked at that in the menu.
[125:07.55]What is it?
[125:07.87]It's ammo?
[125:10.55]It re... Oh, that would be great.
[125:13.41]Fucking have, wouldn't it?
[125:17.26]Wait.
[125:18.24]Are you sure?
[125:20.90]Refills your ammo.
[125:21.72]I can't put it on the hotbar?
[125:22.56]Okay.
[125:32.05]Does this way?
[125:32.55]Does that way?
[125:33.27]Okay.
[125:36.51]This is... Shortcut at the bottom of the level.
[125:48.85]Right?
[125:49.63]I mean, it has to be.
[126:12.96]Although this doesn't really make anything faster.
[126:15.20]It's good to have it unlocked in case.
[126:23.60]There's another one.
[126:29.16]It's good to know.
[126:32.30]I mean, there's a bonfire right here.
[126:47.01]Anything to remember?
[126:48.19]Yep.
[126:59.21]Health boost on parry.
[127:06.05]OK.
[127:13.55]Cool.
[127:17.24]That's a really neat feature.
[127:31.75]I just want enough to go level up one more time.
[127:47.58]That should do it.
[127:50.48]Yes.
[127:54.70]I don't want to lose 10,000 souls.
[128:36.32]That enemy is relentless.
[129:01.20]What are my thoughts on the game so far?
[129:03.21]I would classify this as a game that I'm going to give it the term hidden gem.
[129:19.84]Very truthfully.
[129:40.73]Somebody said it's like Dark Souls meets Paper Mario.
[129:46.15]It's got a bunch of references.
[129:49.45]And you know what else, too?
[129:53.85]It's a game that's baked around kind of comedy.
[129:59.04]But all the comedy and all the humor and all the joke stuff has been it hasn't been really heavy handed or anything.
[130:04.76]It's been very enjoyable.
[130:09.37]What if they listen to this lady again?
[130:36.45]Jesus.
[130:58.89]Mrs. Peach?
[130:59.35]Run home.
[131:00.05]Strength.
[131:29.36]Purify your heart.
[131:31.10]Burn the degradation wrought by your desire.
[131:34.44]Pain is proof of your corruption.
[131:44.55]Okay.
[131:48.37]Sin warps you.
[131:50.43]Clings upon you.
[131:52.57]Purify your flesh.
[131:54.31]Purify your heart.
[131:56.11]Burn the degradation wrought by your desire.
[132:26.88]Humility?
[132:27.54]I can't open this.
[132:40.78]Show your hairy knuckles?
[132:43.88]Alright.
[132:46.82]That's another time that person up for ten minutes.
[133:02.05]You guys are so wacky.
[133:09.63]I'm getting too cocky trying to take two of these on at the same time.
[133:13.81]Caught on a plant.
[134:01.99]You never use the chainsaw?
[134:03.36]Oh my god, I forgot it was in my hand.
[134:04.84]That's true.
[134:05.30]I'll upgrade it when... What the fuck is this?
[134:19.97]Is this a friend?
[134:21.69]No, it's not.
[134:34.76]Now he's angry.
[134:41.30]I gotta go upgrade this thing.
[134:42.46]I definitely do.
[134:56.53]No, don't.
[134:57.51]Whatever.
[134:57.85]I'm running.
[135:07.71]I can do that too, you know.
[135:19.49]I just think of Fenrir from Smite.
[135:41.27]See the whole world, can't you?
[135:43.41]Not really.
[135:43.79]Alright, here's how I'm going to do this.
[136:06.43]Good.
[136:09.27]Oh, she said it.
[136:11.43]Salvation comes from the outside in.
[136:13.85]Do not waver.
[136:39.56]What is going on right now?
[136:57.20]It was happening.
[136:59.12]The elegant, illuminate, spry, minimalist silhouette scaled the monolith.
[137:06.79]The narrator did hope.
[137:09.55]The narrator believed.
[137:13.03]Meat.
[137:29.47]Finish it.
[137:34.53]The awesome stick figure crashed upon them like almighty thunder.
[137:40.43]Rip them to ribbons, my good fellow.
[137:55.26]This is gonna drive me crazy.
[138:05.17]No get it turn it off turn it off Orrin Queen's chill
[138:49.99]That one had a lot more health!
[138:57.00]Holy shit, that was lucky.
[139:11.25]You can't be serious.
[139:14.58]Okay, that... Huh?
[139:19.28]What the hell was that?
[139:24.22]I need to upgrade my weapon.
[139:49.23]Bro, your CD is broken.
[139:51.79]No, did I put toothpaste all over it and cleaned it off?
[139:55.61]Was that, did that actually work?
[139:56.97]I feel like that was a weird myth.
[140:07.14]It was completely made up that everybody kind of believed.
[140:09.28]Did it actually do anything?
[140:15.29]Something about the crystals in the toothpaste.
[140:19.31]Right?
[140:19.96]Something weird.
[140:20.64]Bro, I'm just telling you.
[140:27.94]I'm just telling you.
[140:31.05]That's what people thought.
[140:44.31]Why did people think that?
[140:45.97]Anybody have like an actual answer?
[140:47.19]Shit.
[141:04.55]It was just wild speculation.
[141:06.02]It worked on minor scratches.
[141:08.78]Okay, we're back.
[141:17.11]It was a light abrasive.
[141:23.63]That could smooth out the surface.
[141:24.87]So it wasn't total bullshit then.
[141:26.07]Eh.
[141:39.57]Nostel Gaia.
[141:41.81]Why is this it?
[141:44.51]Hold on.
[141:48.19]Weird, right?
[141:48.71]Hold on.
[141:59.52]Humility.
[142:02.32]Doubt.
[142:08.04]Purify or release.
[142:09.44]Faith.
[142:10.12]What?
[142:10.56]Are we releasing or are we purifying?
[142:14.76]Give me a pull.
[142:16.78]Release or purify.
[142:40.68]I'll reach out to you for a second here.
[142:45.31]There.
[142:46.33]Give you a little bit of time to decide.
[142:47.25]What are we doing?
[143:00.18]Release.
[143:00.60]Purify.
[143:01.52]Purify.
[143:18.89]It's an important hint what she's saying.
[143:20.87]Huh?
[143:28.61]Wait, say it again.
[143:29.67]I want to hear the whole thing.
[143:45.82]I'm in faith, right?
[143:47.12]Okay.
[143:47.48]Hold faith.
[143:48.66]Hold faith that right exceeds... Release?
[143:52.98]She said right.
[143:54.08]She said right.
[143:55.42]But I have to listen to chat here.
[144:13.68]Sorry, chat.
[144:18.31]You picked the wrong one.
[144:20.85]Oops.
[144:21.01]Yeah.
[144:21.49]There are a lot of spells in the game.
[144:47.60]That's a cool little Easter egg.
[144:48.76]Oh shit.
[144:49.28]Wait, isn't humility down here?
[144:52.22]Your ego overcomes your essence.
[145:19.64]have not strayed.
[145:21.18]Humility reveals the depth of your sin.
[145:24.62]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[145:25.64]Say it again.
[145:25.96]What do I need to do?
[145:35.63]Your pride twists you.
[145:37.45]Okay.
[145:38.03]Your ego overcomes your essence.
[145:40.95]Lose the ego?
[145:41.59]Humble yourself.
[145:42.99]Humble myself.
[145:43.85]Beg for guidance from those who have not strayed.
[145:47.55]Humility reveals
[145:51.74]Okay.
[145:54.47]Step on the button?
[145:55.61]Alright, I have to step on the button.
[146:00.69]Humble yourself.
[146:01.41]We did it.
[146:21.25]I don't know.
[146:50.83]Is it a certain outfit?
[146:56.15]Where did this person come from?
[146:57.07]Come fight me over on the button and see what happens.
[147:22.80]I've never dodged that move.
[147:25.64]Okay.
[147:53.41]I mean, this is kind of the opposite of humility.
[147:57.39]I took all of my gear off and BM'd that person.
[148:01.91]I don't think I'll be able to do this.
[148:05.34]I was so prideful that I was proving that I could kill that person with no gear.
[148:11.52]I think I blew it.
[148:14.95]Wait a minute.
[148:15.47]Whoa!
[148:15.73]7,000 bucks.
[148:43.36]Your ego overcomes your essence.
[148:46.72]Humble yourself.
[148:48.82]Beg for guidance from those who have not.
[148:51.62]I can put the whole set on now.
[148:52.85]Humility reveals the depth of your sin.
[149:04.29]That's cool how it actually turns it into like a 3D model.
[149:06.93]Your pride twists you.
[149:09.72]Your ego overcomes your essence.
[149:14.09]I don't get it.
[149:14.59]Sit there for more than ten seconds?
[149:16.99]Just wait.
[149:17.55]There it is.
[149:44.70]Let's go.
[149:47.22]That's a huge ass tower.
[150:14.22]Perfect fit.
[150:27.73]It's a big, heavy thing.
[150:29.69]It's like a roof?
[150:33.05]Minecraft?
[150:38.35]Cool.
[150:39.45]Well, keep going.
[150:44.74]Tetris?
[150:47.08]Beg for guidance from those who have not strayed.
[150:49.72]Humility reveals the depth of your sin.
[151:21.03]I think I've done all the towers.
[151:22.59]Still the ones that I know I can do.
[151:29.96]What games would you say you're the best at?
[151:34.84]If I'm being honest, it's probably games where you have to press a button very fast.
[151:38.04]Salvation comes from the outside in.
[151:45.82]Do not waver.
[151:47.48]Nosalgaria has forgotten her tradition.
[151:52.84]Clicker games.
[151:55.99]Name one game where that's important.
[151:58.19]Name one game.
[152:02.59]Okay.
[152:04.43]I'll tell you.
[152:07.37]I'll tell you, you little bastards.
[152:13.88]In Metal Gear Solid, there is a part
[152:20.36]where you have to press circle as fast as you can to withstand torture.
[152:28.37]I was always the guy in the room when friends of mine would play this.
[152:33.03]Just hand the controller to Jeremy.
[152:37.84]It gets so hard, it gets almost impossible.
[152:42.06]But if you do it, and you do it the whole time, and you actually don't, you actually withstand it, it unlocks an Omega item at the end of the game.
[152:53.66]They used to hand the controller to me.
[153:05.01]You little bastards.
[153:06.33]I'm sorry.
[153:07.67]I thought it would be funny.
[153:09.01]Am I sorry?
[153:14.29]Let's go.
[153:22.62]Now, you know what?
[153:25.02]Not sorry.
[153:56.13]It's bold coming from somebody that's 5'8".
[153:57.53]Have you seen me sprint?
[154:06.54]I bet I'm faster than you.
[154:17.65]Now, I can only do this for about one and a half full seconds before I have to sit down for an hour.
[154:24.09]But you better believe I'd run faster than you.
[154:42.86]Faster than a speeding bolt.
[154:44.26]Yeah, I would actually be a really bad superhero now that I sit here and think about this.
[154:49.80]Even if I had powers, I would run out of gas in fucking 10 minutes.
[154:56.88]I would be like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, punch, punch, kick, kick, kick, slide, kick.
[155:01.77]And then I would take out one person and just sit down on a bench and just breathe heavy for like two hours.
[155:11.50]Just save me for the final boss.
[155:13.22]You know what I mean?
[155:13.92]Like, you... Alright.
[155:15.58]You can just relax for the entire time that, like, Thanos is attacking us.
[155:21.00]But, at the very end, we're just gonna give you, like, an espresso.
[155:25.75]And a bag of Doritos.
[155:28.55]And just... Alright.
[155:29.89]He... Thanos is in that room.
[155:31.43]We've got him cornered.
[155:33.07]Jerma, get in there.
[155:34.45]And that would fuck him up so we have no idea.
[155:47.36]And that's it.
[155:47.74]That's all I would be able to do.
[155:52.56]And I would have to tell them, be like, hey, hey, hey, wait before I get in there, can you wear him down so in ten minutes I'll be able to kill him?
[155:59.44]And they'll do their whole thing, you know, everyone will fight him, and it'll be epic.
[156:03.76]And then everyone will be, like, defeated, and it'll just be me in my fucking underwear.
[156:09.44]With, like, a fucking club.
[156:24.09]And then he just like obliterates me in one second.
[156:52.59]Ooh.
[156:54.21]This is a shortcut.
[156:55.81]30,000 souls.
[157:03.33]You're 40, not 90.
[157:04.51]You could definitely do a roundhouse kick.
[157:06.36]Yeah, I would just queue up a huge roundhouse kick.
[157:10.54]And just... It would be really, really shitty.
[157:13.28]My leg would only come up about a foot and a half.
[157:16.62]But I would kick him with such force in the stomach.
[157:20.24]Just makes him insta-puke.
[157:22.32]And then I would tear two or three muscles in my leg.
[157:26.38]And then Superman kind of comes in and just laser eyes him.
[157:58.07]Why is Superman in Marvel?
[158:00.93]But we're talking about a multi-franchise level threat.
[158:05.84]Which, who knows?
[158:06.44]You know, like, let's be honest for a minute here.
[158:11.32]I feel like Marvel's going so far into this, like, phase five, phase six, phase seven.
[158:16.28]At some point, I'm expecting a, like, Gordon Ramsay-style fucking cooking show in phase seven.
[158:22.72]Like, Wolverine is one of the judges at, I don't know, like, Captain Marvel and, like, fucking Cyclops are competing and shit.
[158:31.66]I feel like we're going there.
[158:33.74]Like, phase eight.
[158:47.32]I don't know what to do.
[158:52.74]Jeremy, you seem like the type of guy to bring a lunchbox to a superhero fight.
[158:58.42]Yeah.
[159:00.02]You don't.
[159:00.68]Okay.
[159:01.56]What about the magic rock that's in that lunchbox?
[159:08.14]That has the power of like 50 grenades.
[159:10.76]What are you going to say about that?
[159:25.59]It's not powerful against like Thanos.
[159:35.02]But then I would just distract him.
[159:40.08]I would do the super funny comic relief thing where I would just be behind Thanos and be like, oh, Thanos.
[159:46.74]Look over here.
[159:48.82]And he'd be like, oh, what's that little worm?
[159:52.72]Insect.
[159:55.15]And I distract him long enough for somebody to hurt him.
[160:08.42]He's the character everybody hates.
[160:09.94]Alright, somebody said this one day in... It was pretty funny.
[160:16.62]You know, sometimes you have to have a little bit of humility.
[160:18.76]Right?
[160:21.05]Somebody said one day, I don't know, by the way, I don't agree with this person, but it was funny.
[160:25.34]And sometimes, you know, whatever.
[160:26.34]It's like if you're making a joke, whatever.
[160:28.80]Somebody said that this stream was a Marvel movie with all the quips and none of the fighting.
[160:37.42]It was just like, Jeremy, your stream is the worst kind of Marvel movie.
[160:40.39]It's just only jokes and there's no action or anything.
[160:43.63]It's just like quips.
[160:51.88]I disagree.
[160:52.80]I disagree with it.
[160:54.99]Wait, which one goes up?
[160:55.71]This one.
[161:02.45]It's wrong, but it's funny.
[161:22.62]Oops.
[161:24.54]Oh no.
[161:31.95]Ow.
[161:33.37]Oh, that was you that got hurt, not me.
[161:50.06]I would just freak Thanos out to a point.
[161:51.81]You know what I mean?
[161:53.23]Everyone always expects we're going to fight.
[161:58.15]Maybe I just wouldn't even fight him.
[162:01.99]I would be like, I want to join you, Thanos.
[162:04.34]I will join you.
[162:05.14]Doesn't he like when people do that?
[162:13.27]Yeah, and then like, I don't know, during one of the biggest battles, there's like 10 people and I'm there and I have access to like the PA system.
[162:19.12]I'm just gonna fart into the PA microphone and just fuck the whole thing up.
[162:23.19]It's gonna be like, what the fuck was that?
[162:24.69]What the hell's going on?
[162:26.42]And then the confusion, they'll be able to get them.
[162:53.37]So unfunny.
[162:54.65]Is that what he said?
[162:55.29]Okay, I need to... I cleared pretty much everything.
[163:17.46]Loki tried that, Jerma, and look at him now.
[163:19.54]I... I didn't see... I didn't watch Loki.
[163:26.14]Wait, Loki in the Loki series farts over the PA?
[163:38.57]What?
[163:39.23]No.
[163:39.43]Um... Where do I go from here?
[163:56.98]Literally, yes, he does.
[163:58.80]Liars, liars, liars, liars.
[164:00.74]Alright, everyone's lying. ...
[164:42.87]I'm getting called out by my girlfriend here.
[164:46.49]She said you would never publicly fart.
[164:51.87]And you know what?
[164:52.37]That's true.
[164:53.83]I would have the opportunity to do that.
[164:55.49]To distract Thanos.
[164:58.86]And I would be like, I can't.
[165:00.14]It's gross.
[165:00.94]No, it's gross.
[165:03.62]And that was what... Yeah, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[165:14.90]No, don't open all the doors at once.
[165:23.92]Wowee.
[165:29.54]What a bad room to fight two of these things in.
[165:33.71]God, what is... I don't know what it does when it fills, but I don't want to know.
[166:02.55]What's this?
[166:05.02]Okay, wait.
[166:05.44]There might be actually something here.
[166:08.44]Anything, uh... Ooh!
[166:14.56]Strength and... Source, but... I mean... You get the bonuses for doing it anyways.
[166:35.85]Holly, not even you are safe from making random messages mean.
[166:50.03]That's funny.
[166:51.51]Okay, so now where do I go?
[166:52.63]She said, I'm laughing here.
[167:00.73]Where do I go?
[167:08.80]Do I have to do something here?
[167:09.60]Hey, apologize for making me sound mean earlier too.
[167:20.15]What if you were being mean and I just don't know it?
[167:55.73]Wait, I know what to do.
[167:59.65]What's gonna happen?
[168:00.27]Oh my goodness.
[168:28.91]The threshold of the fanatic sacristy.
[168:32.33]Last of the Great One lieutenants.
[168:35.88]Almighty guide you, my friend.
[168:54.45]Thanos, your reign of terror ends.
[169:03.28]Oh, this is fucking... I'm dead.
[169:09.01]Oh, shit.
[169:11.43]Wait, I wasn't paying attention.
[169:12.87]I was doing this stupid thing where I'm like, I got 10 minutes, whatever.
[169:17.17]Bloodborne, it's real.
[169:26.60]That's kind of a long walk.
[169:28.98]I guess there's the shortcuts, but still.
[169:35.40]But no.
[169:38.59]No, no, no.
[169:41.31]I want to upgrade.
[169:49.38]Where's the smith?
[169:49.94]Where's the smith?
[169:59.37]What?
[169:59.55]Where's the smith?
[170:05.77]other bonfire oh well dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
[170:44.85]Anyone know how much longer the game will be?
[170:46.13]I think we're at the last boss.
[170:53.47]I imagine this is the last great one, right?
[170:57.81]That's what they said.
[171:05.78]Find out.
[171:06.50]Have to beat it.
[171:12.06]What are your thoughts on the modernizing of McDonald's restaurants?
[171:15.28]I know that that question is bait because they know it's going to get me to talk for like an hour and a half about it.
[171:20.03]But everybody already knows.
[171:22.13]Is there another?
[171:28.79]Did I miss a shortcut?
[171:41.51]I feel like I missed a shortcut.
[171:42.43]I don't know.
[171:45.43]I was reading chat, sorry.
[171:59.22]Alright, let's go.
[172:02.58]Not messing around.
[172:03.20]Perfect dodges.
[172:39.88]I'm dead!
[172:56.17]Greed!
[172:57.47]Yo!
[172:58.77]No!
[173:32.49]Breathe breathe Breathe breathe breathe breathe
[174:02.67]Greed, greed, greed, greed.
[174:15.79]Oh, that music just got really cool too.
[174:40.13]I want to upgrade this.
[174:41.13]Physical.
[175:03.05]That's alright.
[175:05.77]Then upgrade it.
[175:06.59]I know, but I need to go to a... Where?
[175:10.99]Where is he?
[175:11.37]Get this stuff out of the way!
[175:37.81]Wasn't there... I swear to God there was another one right down here.
[175:40.30]I don't want to tether to it.
[175:45.07]I just want to upgrade.
[176:35.33]I'm finding all kinds of new shit right now.
[176:41.73]Wait, this is probably... This is like a graveyard.
[176:43.57]Hold on.
[176:43.97]There's probably something here.
[176:57.66]Right?
[176:57.88]This is kind of an interesting graveyard.
[177:08.92]Shit.
[177:10.43]Oh.
[177:48.22]I don't know.
[177:55.51]I thought there was a smith right back there somewhere.
[177:58.89]Behind the maze.
[178:01.89]I guess I could go this way and then run back.
[178:05.20]I'm gonna.
[178:05.58]This is like one of the final fights.
[178:06.96]Of course I'm gonna be prepared.
[178:18.19]course I'm going to be prepared.
[178:24.05]Alright, so then the way to get out of here to go back to where that... I actually don't remember.
[178:36.50]Where is the way to get back to the bonfire?
[178:39.00]I don't know.
[178:44.16]I'll just beat it without it.
[178:46.40]Give it a shit.
[178:47.32]I got this.
[178:59.81]You've only got 10 days left to play Frog Detective.
[179:02.33]I know.
[179:03.49]I got it.
[179:03.77]Don't worry.
[179:11.42]Can you do this fight and use your Trump voice?
[179:15.84]Let's see how I feel.
[179:52.81]I'm going to be such a greedy asshole too.
[179:54.23]Hold on, there's an item.
[179:59.83]Oh, there's two.
[180:05.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[180:06.31]Nobody fight me.
[180:07.95]Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out.
[180:14.43]The sword is messed up again.
[180:24.74]What's going on?
[180:31.10]I want to get up there.
[180:47.01]New plan.
[180:48.68]Forget about the boss.
[180:50.36]I'm going to clear this room.
[180:52.90]And go do the other little things in this area.
[180:57.28]I feel like there's something else I'm missing.
[180:58.38]Do we have permission to swag out?
[181:04.91]No.
[181:06.23]Not yet.
[181:07.37]No.
[181:09.05]When I beat the last boss, you have complete permission to swag out.
[181:13.95]But I'm going to need you to contain it for a little bit.
[181:18.37]Let's be honest, what are we swagging out for?
[181:22.19]You don't want to preemptively swag out because, I mean, you got to make sure it's worth it.
[181:50.25]You look like Bender from Futurama.
[182:01.22]That's a big one.
[182:11.34]That started out really rough.
[182:13.06]Whatever, I don't... I told you yesterday, I don't give a shit anymore.
[182:33.35]Oh my goodness.
[182:34.57]Come on.
[182:41.77]I think he actually does give a shit and his feelings were hurt.
[182:44.14]Uh oh, evil arc.
[182:54.28]No, I'm fucking kidding.
[182:58.14]I do want to clear this though.
[183:08.78]I don't want you to do that thing.
[183:11.34]You, first of all, you die now.
[183:13.55]I was running.
[183:41.16]Okay, that's that part done.
[183:46.87]I don't need to worry about that.
[183:53.23]That's fine.
[183:57.10]I wasn't prepared for the crit.
[183:59.12]It's going to be the downfall.
[184:04.48]Irma, you have a right-handed weapon.
[184:27.72]uh this being in my left hand I get extra crit damage only if I swing with my left hand oh god damn it this is bad
[184:54.03]Yeah, it's, uh... Swinging with the left hand just does more damage for this exact character.
[185:01.47]It was built with precision to be able to do the things I'm doing right now.
[185:14.53]It's just... It's just so goddamn annoying, that tracking on... This... It... The... It... Oh...
[185:29.13]Racking on that Trident.
[185:30.67]It's just like... My heart is pounding.
[185:52.91]Well, get up there and help me fight.
[185:56.97]I don't want any of this wait till the last 10 minutes bullshit.
[186:01.84]That's my gig.
[186:02.94]I think I'm just gonna run.
[186:34.74]Hey bro, my summon sign is at the door.
[186:36.25]Yeah, but your name is, is Pissdrinker5000.
[186:38.43]I'm not, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna have you on stream.
[187:15.65]Okay.
[187:17.21]I'm not doing this again.
[187:18.49]I need to be very good about this.
[187:23.03]And here's how we're going to play it.
[187:25.43]Who cares?
[187:27.70]Run.
[187:37.72]Figured out I cared.
[187:40.40]Isn't there a blacksmith right here?
[187:42.71]I don't care.
[187:59.83]I actually do have to get a couple of kills.
[188:00.97]Because I want to open the chest.
[188:02.85]I need, what?
[188:04.27]10?
[188:04.29]11,000?
[188:04.61]To open the chest and the door.
[188:24.80]Bring it on.
[188:30.75]Yeah, alright.
[188:31.41]The wolves in the bathrobe, you just have to spam and just hope I get a crit because it'll kill them.
[188:39.61]Okay, going up.
[188:53.09]Don't you kill me.
[188:54.93]You're going to throw in a homing missile at me.
[189:13.55]That move sucks asshole.
[189:15.91]It's it's so fast and it just like it just homes to you And they can throw it from wherever they are on the map and it just like teleports to your character
[189:48.15]How come you get so mad at the end of... I'm not mad at all.
[189:50.29]I'm having a great time.
[189:53.19]Do not confuse... Do not confuse jokey frustration with anger.
[189:59.38]I'm fine.
[190:11.00]I am not mad at alright now.
[190:14.99]I'm just coming out here.
[190:15.97]I'm just relaxing.
[190:21.09]Don't you hate it when you're really, like, annoyed or mad about something?
[190:24.23]And you need to talk.
[190:27.25]And it's just like, I'm just trying so hard to form normal fucking sentences.
[190:31.80]Because the whole time you just want to go, hey, hey.
[190:53.99]Check this out.
[191:08.41]I've had my eyes closed this whole time.
[191:11.53]Just opened them.
[191:27.10]I've been really mad at a game before and I'm just like, I don't know.
[191:35.71]Do you see that?
[191:36.41]Alright, this is going to be risky.
[191:54.60]Almost didn't get it.
[191:59.80]We're good.
[192:00.11]Okay.
[192:05.90]Let's chill out.
[192:06.38]There's so much shit up here.
[192:28.44]Very good.
[192:30.29]I have enough to open both of those things.
[192:32.31]Let's just not screw it up.
[192:33.31]I'm going to do this because I don't... This person's really annoying.
[192:59.45]Dude, unplug the steering wheel and use a normal controller.
[193:06.94]That'd be so hard.
[193:18.51]Alright.
[193:19.63]Only one enemy left.
[193:31.58]We did it.
[193:31.92]Alright.
[193:33.20]What's in here?
[193:39.09]Ruined uplifting barbell.
[193:42.53]Probably strength.
[193:46.55]Equipment load.
[193:47.29]Hmm.
[193:47.81]I think I'm going to put that on.
[193:56.66]At 58.
[193:57.30]What is it normally?
[193:58.18]67.
[193:59.62]Probably not that much.
[194:30.05]Shit.
[194:34.65]This is 13%.
[194:35.23]Okay.
[194:47.24]Sounds good.
[194:50.70]Expensive, but hopefully there's something in here.
[195:33.14]Security code?
[195:35.48]Hmm?
[195:46.52]Anything shaking?
[195:56.88]No.
[195:59.84]Security code, keep memory on death.
[196:02.02]That's pretty nifty.
[196:34.32]Mario!
[196:39.01]Mario!
[196:41.43]Mario!
[196:42.13]I don't think that was worth 10,000 souls, but... I only have two heals left.
[196:51.38]Let's just do this again.
[196:54.42]Wait, is there anything else here that I didn't do?
[196:55.68]Before I leave.
[197:00.72]Refresh.
[197:27.52]So that's to go down.
[197:35.95]I think I'm alright.
[197:44.71]Okay.
[197:46.89]Level up a couple more times and then go for it.
[198:09.93]It's going to be a lot, I think.
[198:12.63]Yep.
[198:13.63]Alright.
[198:15.51]How we doing?
[198:28.35]Cool.
[198:28.49]Let's try it again.
[198:35.21]Please listen to us.
[198:37.27]Hmm?
[198:47.54]There's a bonfire at the top of the lift here.
[199:09.76]You're going to have to only listen to the music one more time.
[199:12.12]Because I'm going to kill the boss right now.
[199:33.69]Can we bet?
[199:35.23]Um... Yeah.
[199:38.44]I mean, if a mod wants to do it.
[199:45.45]I'm not fucking around this time, as you'll see in a second.
[200:13.78]I'm so curious where this goes.
[200:15.56]Definitely goes up.
[200:21.93]Where the hell is that?
[200:52.76]Good luck, everybody.
[200:53.34]I'm going to pop every cooldown and run in there.
[201:38.59]I thought I didn't have the heal on.
[201:42.55]Well, that's unfortunate.
[201:46.40]I thought I had- I didn't switch.
[201:48.78]Whatever.
[201:53.86]She's killing me in two hits.
[201:55.52]I'm kind of concerned about this.
[202:00.71]She's hitting me two times and I die.
[202:20.66]How could you do this to me?
[202:22.76]Oh no, that person's sad.
[202:24.92]I know that this is gonna give me crits.
[202:43.83]Crit damage up and off hand.
[202:47.33]But I wonder if it's worth just two-handing it.
[202:51.33]I don't know.
[202:55.86]I tried to do the thing in these games where you press the button and leave, but you can't.
[202:59.38]You cannot do that.
[203:00.02]Maybe parries?
[203:28.20]Would not vote yes on this.
[203:31.15]But, um, I don't know who.
[203:33.93]It's up to you.
[203:36.65]Do what you want with your points.
[203:46.44]Who knows?
[203:47.40]She does that move where she queues up and then dives forward slash.
[203:50.60]I might be able to get it pretty perfectly.
[203:59.45]Somebody said, get this elevator.
[204:00.77]I don't know where to go for it.
[204:03.21]I feel like I've explored everything here.
[204:05.55]Maybe not.
[204:07.57]Maybe I should go look.
[204:19.12]I don't know.
[204:31.47]Alright.
[204:32.73]I'm going for it.
[204:33.43]I'm gonna try... I'm going parry strategy.
[204:46.94]See if it works.
[205:08.77]She's broken.
[205:09.29]She's broken.
[205:10.09]She's broken.
[205:10.59]She's broken.
[205:11.11]She's broken.
[205:12.45]What do I do?
[205:13.53]Where do I go?
[205:14.63]Should I wrap around and try to stab her?
[205:16.57]Oh my god, I win!
[205:30.98]What?
[205:35.26]That was a perfect parry.
[205:36.36]Slow it down.
[205:38.73]Oh my god, she's broken!
[205:42.97]Oh my god, just stay alive.
[205:47.30]The parry breaks her animations.
[205:57.60]Don't!
[205:59.44]Holy shit!
[206:00.45]What the?
[206:01.23]What?
[206:08.46]I know the strat.
[206:09.02]I know the strat.
[206:12.76]Dude, this is like... What the hell?
[206:18.21]Do you like my song?
[206:21.07]I'm gonna break this and just win.
[206:22.63]Who cares?
[206:29.41]How are you still losing?
[206:31.37]Because this boss has a move that just goes... And you're dead.
[206:45.31]Get more physical resistance.
[206:47.09]I put all my points into... Oh, good thing I could go buy a lottery ticket.
[206:52.18]I got really lucky today.
[206:54.26]I have eight equipment load.
[206:59.33]I can't even wear anything.
[207:00.81]This shit's made out of plastic.
[207:17.81]There's a closer beacon.
[207:18.83]Alright.
[207:20.65]If there is actually a closer beacon, I want... Can I get directions?
[207:28.94]Okay.
[207:29.68]From where I'm standing right now... Where do I go?
[207:33.48]Please give me directions.
[207:41.92]In the door.
[207:42.34]Okay.
[207:46.95]Now where?
[208:00.98]Oh.
[208:06.21]Thanks, dude.
[208:19.59]Isn't this... I want to... I want... Where's the smith?
[208:22.86]I'm going to the smith.
[208:24.86]It's down here, right?
[208:28.44]Like, I'm... No, where's the smith?
[208:47.36]Where's the smith?
[208:48.48]Heather Warp.
[208:52.34]Yeah.
[208:56.86]Teleport?
[208:57.56]You cannot teleport.
[208:59.20]This game is sort of like Dark Souls 1.
[209:03.00]There is no teleporting between bonfires.
[209:06.18]There are a shitload of shortcuts.
[209:08.56]The game is full of them.
[209:11.60]You're supposed to do that.
[209:13.04]But I have no memory, so it's hard to do that.
[209:24.70]I want to make a milkshake after the stream, but I don't have any ice cream.
[209:31.99]Make banana?
[209:34.17]Got any ice?
[209:34.67]You got ice?
[209:48.74]Jesus, that scared me.
[209:54.02]Ice?
[209:54.16]Ice?
[209:55.73]Oat milk.
[209:58.18]Banana.
[209:58.54]Freeze the bananas.
[210:00.04]I'll save you some time.
[210:01.60]Oat milk.
[210:02.80]Frozen bananas.
[210:03.44]A little bit of peanut butter.
[210:06.10]You're done.
[210:09.00]That's all it takes.
[210:17.86]Peanut butter banana smoothies are phenomenal.
[210:31.85]What do you guys eat?
[210:32.55]There has to be a way where I do not take her out of this, right?
[211:32.46]This is cheap and you all know it?
[211:35.26]Well, I'm running out of these shurikens, so it's not over yet.
[211:55.50]No, now I have an- Okay, now here's the plan.
[211:57.20]Ready?
[211:57.40]Check this out.
[211:58.56]Okay, now I'm gonna put this sword in my offhand and crit the absolute hell out of her.
[212:03.06]Ready?
[212:23.35]This shit takes too long!
[212:31.53]Oh!
[212:40.06]I just punched her in the face.
[212:48.20]I tried to do it, but it didn't work.
[212:59.10]Got it.
[213:00.03]What?
[213:12.76]Fuck!
[213:17.21]Oh!
[213:17.79]I'm alive!
[213:18.27]I'm alive!
[213:18.61]I'm alive!
[213:28.00]What's with this dropkick shit?
[213:31.30]Stop doing that!
[213:32.36]Alright, wait.
[213:43.52]Got it!
[213:45.52]Yes!
[214:53.93]I don't even need the exploit.
[215:10.02]Finished her.
[215:13.37]Alright, I can go turn that thing on.
[215:16.89]Now phase two, right?
[215:25.38]Do I become Elden Lord?
[215:26.37]Hmm, what should I use?
[215:38.15]I don't think it matters.
[215:40.05]If I could upgrade this, I would use it.
[215:41.47]Okay.
[215:44.85]So I have to go all the way back to that place underneath what looked like the Firelink Shrine.
[216:08.21]What have you done?
[216:29.12]What?
[216:29.22]Did I just get a wicked shit ending?
[216:31.22]I just got a shit ending.
[216:32.98]Oh, wait.
[216:33.35]Minced...
[216:57.81]This hero's story endures.
[217:05.20]Thanks, Dad.
[217:05.68]Appreciate it.
[217:09.94]My old friend has lost his meaning, his purpose, so he prevents the next chapter of your story from unfolding.
[217:19.64]You must confront him.
[217:22.10]His grief, as before, has whisked him away to the start of sequence, a place where meaning was once conveyed.
[217:30.94]It long ago became inaccessible to heroes.
[217:34.50]We must find you a way inside.
[217:39.97]Perhaps a way which your kind was never meant to see.
[217:44.17]Meet me below this husk of a keep.
[217:53.74]Memory of a monarch.
[217:55.40]It's a little one.
[217:56.02]That's tiny.
[217:57.82]Return to the edge of the wild.
[217:59.94]You shall pry open the narrator's mouth and extract the information.
[218:06.32]Return you.
[218:07.08]Okay.
[218:22.24]oh this is where it is uh I'm gonna go up though I was wondering I was like where the hell even even is this thing are you the sus guy that's my little brother we share this account
[218:48.06]Anything you've ever heard of this channel, like outside of being on this channel, is my little brother did it.
[219:14.28]Hmm.
[219:19.64]Your hero will come.
[219:20.82]Your hero will come.
[219:24.24]Weird.
[219:27.04]Can I do anything in this room?
[219:34.81]There are no heroes.
[219:37.49]Huh.
[219:41.44]Except for me.
[219:44.90]I'll be a hero.
[219:53.43]You are the little brother.
[219:54.65]No.
[219:58.76]No, I'm not.
[220:04.20]Every time you see Mario Kart be played on this channel, that's my little brother.
[220:30.72]How do I get back to the beginning of the game?
[220:32.98]Hey dude, I think I saw you at the Warped Tour moshing in the mosh pit.
[220:51.59]Well, I'm sorry to say that was not me.
[220:55.71]It must have been my little brother.
[221:24.96]Your little brother's got quite the life.
[221:28.20]Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[221:33.09]Okay, this is the fun... This is the fun time.
[221:37.27]Wait, return icon.
[221:40.15]Oh, cool.
[221:43.27]This is the fun part where I get to have no idea where the hell I'm going.
[221:50.22]And a thousand of you are going to make fun of me.
[221:53.30]The other 60 million people that are here will be very nice to me and tell me exactly where I need to go and help me and do the best they can to make sure that I can get there in a timely manner.
[222:07.28]I'm just going to walk in an oak.
[222:09.80]You should not give up.
[222:11.72]Such is your nature, yet you never succeed.
[222:15.50]My success was never measured by the outcome my actions seemed to want.
[222:20.81]Perhaps yours is not measured by your class.
[222:24.15]And the King's?
[222:26.71]Such as I thought.
[222:28.47]The success of a father is measured by that of their progeny.
[222:36.69]Yeah, it's the bug viewers and I got a huge, huge bug audience.
[222:40.68]They're super cool too.
[222:41.46]They're always like super supportive and awesome.
[222:46.01]It's really cool.
[222:46.47]I was thinking about changing the stream to be like bugs only, like no humans anymore.
[222:55.71]I was going to be like a bug streamer.
[223:00.17]It is done, then the fanatics reign of order has finally passed, but the crown long repressed is now only ash.
[223:09.54]The heirloom.
[223:11.12]What is it?
[223:48.83]Hmm.
[224:01.23]Wonderful point maker.
[224:05.05]I have a final decision to make of what I'm going to upgrade, but this is kind of cool.
[224:08.96]What's the scaling?
[224:12.92]Everything?
[224:16.86]Wait, I can remember this.
[224:19.49]Oh.
[224:22.04]Throughout Nostalgia are many staging rooms, secret places never meant for a hero to wander.
[224:29.26]The great maze of these corridors leads to the NPC city, a respite for all those facilitating the great ritual to cast off their costumes and simply
[224:41.41]Okay.
[224:41.97]I was in a lot of those earlier.
[224:45.20]Okay, so... I feel like I have no idea where that is.
[225:11.98]I have absolutely no clue.
[225:26.43]I remember walking around in it.
[225:32.97]I think there's one here somewhere to get there.
[225:35.25]I'm just gonna run.
[225:39.87]Isn't there one of those here somewhere?
[225:52.15]I hear you're on good terms with the roaches.
[225:55.60]Yeah.
[225:58.48]The beetles, the ants, the roaches.
[226:03.10]Bees.
[226:17.03]Mantis.
[226:25.37]That's dangerous.
[226:28.91]Staging area.
[226:33.74]Shit.
[226:34.76]Um... My eye is so itchy.
[226:46.32]Do you like jumping spiders?
[226:47.36]Jumping spiders are cute.
[226:49.98]They have, um... They have, like, a face.
[227:08.97]Uh... What the hell?
[227:13.97]Staging area.
[227:19.63]Right here?
[227:20.01]Alright, here it is.
[227:36.36]Must tell Gaia...
[227:43.07]OK, so this is where I need to be.
[227:44.33]NPC city.
[227:51.48]NPC city.
[228:02.60]I explored down here a lot, so I'm actually kind of glad I knew where this was.
[228:05.88]Hello.
[228:13.60]Ah, this is where I couldn't go before.
[228:16.40]You have fought for us all, a herald of what may be.
[228:21.06]There is power in the future you bring, but you are drawn from some forgotten time and space.
[228:29.27]The memory of you does not fit, and that too gives you power.
[228:35.57]Fear not the shallowness from whence you came, for its meaning is multidimensional.
[228:41.55]Embrace the depth of what you are.
[228:47.69]Some areas have collapsed into a one-dimensional surface.
[228:50.27]You can traverse these areas by harnessing your inner flatness.
[228:53.03]Approach this wall and think flat thoughts.
[229:07.76]What?
[229:11.53]New ability, Flat Counter.
[229:13.19]When you see this above an enemy, stand still and press B.
[229:27.59]I've seen that before.
[229:28.50]In PC City.
[229:34.03]Cool.
[229:34.43]Can I do it?
[229:57.49]you seek to confront the power of story leave me to my misery oh okay that you
[230:33.31]Whoa, this is weird.
[230:41.15]What's this?
[230:48.65]All of heroes.
[230:51.17]Wait, this is... This is the... Yeah, this is the tutorial.
[230:56.80]Okay, so this is back in the very beginning of the game.
[231:05.26]Set it here.
[231:07.70]Can't really level up or anything.
[231:14.52]Keep going.
[231:17.59]Dude, isn't that so crazy?
[231:19.57]In the tutorial, this door was the end game.
[231:22.77]Imagine being able to walk through there.
[231:24.93]This is the last part is the end game final boss through here.
[231:28.73]It's so insane.
[231:33.65]I actually do think that's... I like... I like that.
[231:36.21]Actually interesting to me.
[231:38.83]Like, you're so close, but so far.
[231:40.06]I like it.
[231:41.20]If you don't like it, get out of here.
[231:44.90]Why?
[231:45.04]What are you doing here?
[232:08.84]Nice.
[232:12.27]A memory saber?
[232:18.91]Strength.
[232:19.31]God damn it.
[232:25.50]You unlock it here.
[232:52.61]Tale of luck.
[232:55.57]Why did you have to do decks?
[232:58.75]Because in the first three or four hours of the game, I found a cool weapon that scaled off of decks and off of luck.
[233:09.79]I know you're probably saying that's not true But it is because luck gets me more crit more crit damage in my offhand the scales with dexterity Therefore it's perfect for the class that I'm playing right now.
[233:30.87]I Mean this is kind of rude
[233:41.52]Modified cane of what was it?
[233:46.30]Modified cane of helpfulness there's so many cool strength weapons It's just an axe
[234:09.57]I feel like this thing's pretty good for being in the other hand.
[234:16.99]And I committed to dual welding as well.
[234:21.49]That's why.
[234:24.63]Bloodborne.
[234:28.68]Oh, right.
[234:29.16]Wait, I just hit... Let me try that.
[234:41.48]Jesus, dude.
[234:48.57]Wait, what?
[234:49.61]What just happened?
[234:53.45]I am so confused right now.
[235:02.28]Did that, like, stun him?
[235:03.32]Alright, you gotta dodge through that, not to the left or to the right.
[235:18.87]Oh, there it is.
[235:19.55]Of course, you're going to let me have that item too, but it's going to be strength.
[235:26.93]Strength decks.
[235:29.37]Can't put it on.
[235:29.85]I can remember it though.
[235:33.00]It's a lot, but whatever.
[235:39.02]Freeze damage to abominations.
[235:52.20]Yeah.
[235:53.76]Cool.
[235:57.98]It looks like a most... Alright, so... It seems like a huge amount of items scale with strength.
[236:03.97]Dex.
[236:04.95]Dex source.
[236:07.25]Nothing really scales with luck.
[236:12.17]I mean, the crit thing is luck.
[236:14.39]But there's no weapon that... Luck is not a stat that... And you know what?
[236:17.43]I don't even want to talk to you.
[236:20.51]But I will.
[236:24.17]If you want to heal the heart that actually matters, unburden her.
[236:28.49]Maybe I should do this to something.
[236:41.82]Or is this a bad end or something?
[236:43.70]I unburden something and I get the bad end.
[236:45.82]I'm not doing it.
[236:56.87]Nobody likes you.
[237:22.40]That was mean.
[237:24.20]I only said that because I look over at chat and I see everybody say, leave, don't talk to him, don't, leave, don't even look at that guy.
[237:29.28]I just heard a, uh... Huh?
[237:45.40]Where is it?
[237:59.82]What is that?
[238:00.20]Does it hurt?
[238:09.12]Oh.
[238:17.49]I thought it was a shadow.
[238:21.29]I thought it was a shadow on the ground.
[238:22.47]I didn't think it was a bunch of holes.
[238:24.21]I thought it was a shadow.
[238:37.88]The hall of junior heroes.
[238:56.96]Jeez.
[239:12.24]Not this again.
[239:12.82]I didn't mean... Alright, we're good.
[239:57.19]OK, cool.
[240:01.99]Good.
[240:03.99]Show.
[240:13.72]What happened there?
[240:21.54]What?
[240:32.98]Can you please do your chickadee-dee-dee noise?
[240:36.76]No, I'm alright.
[240:37.97]Not right now.
[240:41.63]No.
[240:41.75]Not when I'm this upset.
[241:03.71]Alright, let's do it again.
[241:04.51]Away!
[241:17.56]Away!
[241:18.02]Oh, you crazy little rat!
[241:27.24]It's all your fault!
[241:50.40]So I thought it was, you grave stealing rat.
[241:56.69]You grave stealing rat.
[242:04.24]That's what I actually thought it was.
[242:22.54]Can we just do the other part of the combo?
[242:27.69]You're really making all of us mad.
[242:36.15]You're just making everybody mad now.
[242:57.15]Let's try this again.
[243:00.49]This time I will be aware of that.
[243:05.14]And you have not aggroed yet, so let me just cheese this.
[243:08.00]I think that's cheesed enough.
[243:20.41]You too?
[243:24.60]You still hit me.
[243:27.50]Okay.
[243:35.15]That's the... I have a lot of points in dex.
[243:39.01]That thing is actually saving me a lot of time.
[243:51.26]That's the one great reason to use Dex.
[243:53.96]That item.
[243:54.48]Shit.
[244:13.57]Dex is 10.
[244:14.03]I feel like I still don't understand how that thing works.
[244:21.70]Easy maker key.
[244:29.36]Drake saber.
[244:33.06]Oh, remember I asked how to get up here.
[244:35.56]Wait a minute.
[244:50.31]Oh my god, this is cool.
[245:05.00]It's for a girl scout cookie?
[245:08.44]Um... I like the mint ones.
[245:29.70]ladder here too.
[245:35.56]I'm not supposed to even be here.
[245:58.83]Alright, what was this for?
[246:00.90]Silver of tradition.
[246:02.50]Oh, no, hold on.
[246:10.50]That it?
[246:14.54]Is that all that's here?
[246:29.39]I think I've... I've been here now.
[246:31.49]Yeah, I've been here before.
[246:32.31]Yeah, I've done this already.
[246:34.59]Goodbye.
[246:41.47]Well, that's cool that it wraps all the way around.
[246:44.25]But, how do I... Get back?
[246:57.37]Like this.
[247:12.55]Please play A Link Between Worlds right now.
[247:14.84]You're going to have to wait at least a week.
[247:17.42]So you're going to have to wait at least a week.
[247:23.32]And up to a couple of years, at least.
[247:30.47]There's a range in there somewhere.
[247:32.79]And halfway through that range, I might just not feel like playing it, so I probably won't play it.
[247:44.98]Ooh, Dex.
[247:47.15]I said, come on.
[248:00.46]This thing seems so cool.
[248:22.98]Reminds me of Banjo Kazooie talking.
[248:37.76]Holy...
[248:53.07]You should play Kerbal Space Program.
[248:57.07]Dude, is this a fake memory?
[248:59.81]Or did I play Kerbal Space Program 1 for like 30 or 40 minutes and I just couldn't comprehend it?
[249:08.12]I couldn't do it.
[249:09.60]I couldn't stand it.
[249:11.20]And I was like, guys, I'm sorry, I can't play this game.
[249:14.61]That happened, didn't it?
[249:18.47]I remember, yeah, no, it really did.
[249:20.29]I think I did.
[249:24.41]Not on stream?
[249:27.11]Is this... This has to be a real memory.
[249:29.11]Maybe I, like, was gonna make a video on it, and I was just, like, 30 minutes in, I was like, no fucking way.
[249:33.85]I never streamed it.
[249:36.18]Maybe I was gonna make a video on it.
[249:42.34]That's probably what it is.
[249:43.18]Maybe when it was... It was really, really kind of popular back in the old YouTube days.
[249:48.79]That sounds more accurate, yeah.
[249:49.85]Well, that's what happened.
[250:12.82]Jeremy, please play Animal Crossing again.
[250:14.52]I want to see your island.
[250:15.38]Dude, I'm going to go back to that island and it's going to be a bunch of fucking skeletons.
[250:19.72]I haven't played Animal Crossing in like a year and a half.
[250:31.19]That would be depressing.
[250:32.23]I don't want to do that.
[250:33.21]I'd have to start a new land or something.
[250:46.36]This is such a cool feature.
[250:59.20]Utter annihilator.
[251:01.20]It's going to be a strength weapon.
[251:02.62]You don't come on.
[251:06.19]Damn it.
[251:06.63]I probably don't have enough to remember it.
[251:15.97]Whoa.
[251:22.75]This thing is kind of amazing.
[251:37.96]100% of almost everything.
[251:42.36]I can't remember it.
[251:44.21]Um, but hold on.
[251:44.93]Increased damage for remembered weapons?
[251:49.51]Increased stamina regen speed is at 20.
[251:52.59]I need one, I need to remember one more thing.
[251:55.86]I think I can get there.
[251:57.36]Yeah, I can definitely get there.
[252:11.74]Let's do it.
[252:29.73]Cool.
[252:34.37]Secret cow level.
[252:35.03]Oh my god.
[252:38.53]Diablo II.
[252:43.89]So now, increase stamina regen speed.
[252:46.77]That's huge.
[252:47.73]I feel like I should go down that way, but no.
[253:07.46]Diablo.
[253:11.81]Isn't Diablo going into a beta or something in a month?
[253:16.76]I've not paid very much attention to that game.
[253:18.22]I've just been so... I don't even want to know.
[253:23.97]Is it good?
[253:25.17]Has anybody tried it at any of the times they've allowed people to play it?
[253:34.98]Yeah, I have not paid attention to pretty much anything Blizzard in God.
[253:40.04]It's been since probably Overwatch 1.
[253:42.46]Maybe Hearthstone a little bit.
[253:45.41]But not really.
[253:52.83]Not really.
[253:53.83]Where do I go from here?
[254:15.44]go flat there, but eh.
[254:16.66]Should I go down there?
[254:34.27]Most of like, wow, wow, classic.
[254:38.06]Um, I gave it a look.
[254:42.78]I'll be honest.
[254:44.64]But, I mean... I'm just not into it anymore.
[254:48.96]Like, at all.
[254:53.84]These are red.
[254:55.67]I'm drinking this.
[255:07.15]Holy shit.
[255:08.25]That's bad.
[255:17.73]Overwatch 2 is decent.
[255:19.42]I've heard that it's pretty good.
[255:21.00]I just have no interest.
[255:25.94]The only thing that would really want me to play a Blizzard game is if Diablo 4 is... Holy shit, bro.
[255:33.14]Bro, you have no idea.
[255:35.12]Diablo 4 is... You have no idea.
[255:38.63]And then I'd be like, holy shit, I have no idea apparently.
[255:41.71]And maybe I'll try it.
[255:49.11]That's probably what it would take.
[255:49.93]Ow, fuck.
[256:02.72]No!
[256:17.19]We're good?
[256:20.20]Bro, you have no idea.
[256:21.42]That's so bad.
[256:23.86]That's a run ruiner right there.
[256:31.37]Mm-hmm.
[256:35.47]Where are you going?
[256:36.03]Are you going run ruiner?
[256:38.92]I'm not going to let you do that.
[256:59.72]I think that's the other side of the sewer thing that I was looking at in the very beginning of the game.
[257:12.49]Who even is hitting who here?
[257:32.67]Any memories?
[257:44.47]Nope.
[257:55.92]Satisfying noise.
[257:59.36]Finally, the smith.
[258:01.36]Where are you?
[258:10.99]Finally the smith.
[258:16.20]Where are you?
[258:19.00]Oh, thank goodness.
[258:30.87]Last time I'll probably see your face.
[258:33.41]Oh.
[259:05.73]Well, this thing, I'm going to max this out because it's obviously for the build.
[259:09.97]I need one more of these to get it maxed.
[259:18.73]But also... Do I want to upgrade something?
[259:31.24]I feel like I need to do something.
[259:36.01]the default dagger up.
[259:37.75]Actually, no, it's this one.
[259:39.81]Although it's not remembered.
[259:40.85]I feel like it's not worth it.
[259:53.40]I could put a point... I could put two points in strength and one point in source and be able to put this on, but it's not remembered.
[260:12.79]Probably this.
[260:13.39]The key is kind of cool.
[260:26.31]I have it memory unlocked.
[260:28.17]Dex 1.1.
[260:42.78]I probably would have done this.
[260:49.47]One... Two point... Wait a minute.
[260:53.53]Excuse me?
[260:57.47]This thing is... A dex weapon.
[261:01.22]Loot, heroes, loot.
[261:03.00]I need to get this remembered.
[261:03.86]Where do I go?
[261:07.48]Festivity row.
[261:13.21]Maybe that's the other hand.
[261:14.51]This one's 2.3.
[261:21.43]I had options here.
[261:25.49]Gilded Axe or Loot Hero's Loot.
[261:28.19]This is 2.2 scaling.
[261:35.57]I have it remembered.
[261:42.74]I feel like I could just beef this up like crazy.
[261:50.49]This also... This is kind of ugly.
[261:58.69]This is a two-hander.
[262:02.39]This is unburdened, but... Kind of cool.
[262:10.31]I think it's... I'm going to go loot.
[262:20.95]That's funny.
[262:21.33]I mean, if it scales this well off of decks, then why not?
[262:30.39]It's a Guitar Hero controller.
[262:42.84]Let's level it up.
[262:46.74]Why not?
[262:49.92]I definitely want this to be maxed out because that's the best weapon I have for my character.
[262:58.64]Alright.
[262:58.98]So where is it?
[262:59.64]Let's do it.
[263:07.51]Tradition.
[263:11.59]Right.
[263:11.83]Wait, what do I need?
[263:13.03]Piece of tradition.
[263:13.95]So this is fragment of tradition.
[263:18.99]Fragment of Tradition.
[263:19.91]Piece of Tradition.
[263:24.35]120, 193.
[263:25.95]No, what is it now?
[263:26.81]112, 183.
[263:26.85]121, 272.
[263:26.91]Pretty good.
[263:27.37]It's not even remembered yet.
[263:29.73]So, I have to go back to that kind of loot dungeon.
[263:48.27]I really I'm not sure what that is.
[263:50.38]Maybe it's right here.
[263:51.08]That would be so cool if it was, but hold on.
[263:59.76]Where does this go?
[264:22.27]Repurposed cane of support.
[264:27.75]The combo with these two together is way, way better.
[264:40.80]Strengthened decks.
[264:47.04]Hmm.
[264:57.57]I like this thing a lot.
[264:58.23]It's great.
[264:58.61]It's a great follow-up from the other side.
[265:02.13]Good stuff.
[265:08.14]Finally got my build.
[265:08.94]It only took to the last, like, 30 minutes of the game.
[265:15.10]Every hero who spawned upon Nostalgia, I told their tale, defined their tellings.
[265:24.67]This is the end of your story.
[265:34.63]Start of sequence.
[265:35.72]Oh, this is the... I made it to the end zone.
[265:42.00]We're not doing this.
[265:42.88]You're ignoring the peppermint guy?
[265:52.82]What peppermint guy?
[266:10.37]Where am I?
[266:10.79]Hall of Heroes.
[266:18.23]Wait, there's a door back here that I can open now.
[266:20.00]Alright, hold on.
[266:20.70]Let me hang out here for a minute.
[266:23.50]There's shit I can do here.
[266:32.10]Where is some of it?
[266:35.28]There's some of those glitch doors here.
[266:36.70]Somebody ate 30 peppermints and is it going to shit their pants?
[266:46.41]Why are you eating that many?
[266:47.65]What are you doing?
[266:48.29]Eat three.
[266:58.36]Eat three.
[267:13.39]Okay, looking for a glitch door.
[267:22.26]I heard it blinking.
[267:23.74]Where is it?
[267:36.48]Further away now.
[267:59.33]What the hell is making that sound?
[268:04.79]Is it just the torches and it's just messing with me?
[268:32.20]Then the wall.
[268:38.25]Or is it down?
[268:38.99]It might be all the way down.
[269:05.74]Oh!
[269:06.22]Look what I found!
[269:08.82]What was the point of this?
[269:32.68]No point?
[269:40.36]No point.
[269:49.70]Hmm.
[269:56.29]Alright.
[270:00.57]Is it a memory, maybe?
[270:01.79]Oh, it's definitely that.
[270:04.92]Yes, it is.
[270:05.82]It's gonna be the target chest piece.
[270:09.52]There it is.
[270:10.10]I think that might be better.
[270:18.72]This is 1813.
[270:28.07]20.
[270:29.53]Am I fat rolling?
[270:34.61]Shit, I am.
[270:36.63]Well, it's cool to know.
[270:47.72]Alright, let me go back to where I was.
[270:50.14]I have a shortcut here.
[270:55.74]It's really, really, really freaking cool.
[271:08.99]My addiction to peppermint started around Christmas.
[271:12.57]I needed him for a gingerbread house, but there was some left, and I ate the whole bag in a week, and I ate two bags in a week, and now I would say that I eat 20 a day.
[271:21.45]I'm going to tell you that's probably not a great idea.
[271:25.06]I don't know how harsh that is on you, but yeah, I'm not a doctor.
[271:31.94]I'm not a scientist.
[271:34.84]But that does not sound healthy.
[271:38.04]It sounds like a lot.
[271:48.62]But yeah, I'm sorry that happened.
[271:53.44]Or thank you for the feedback.
[271:56.62]I don't know.
[271:58.04]What do you want me to say?
[272:10.68]What?
[272:10.94]How am I supposed to respond to that?
[272:15.27]Hey, dude, I eat, uh, like, I eat 20 fucking peppermints a day.
[272:18.23]What do you think?
[272:21.69]It's a little abnormal?
[272:26.40]Apparently.
[272:26.96]Hey.
[272:27.58]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[272:32.10]So, GrottoBeasts, GrottoBeasts account, Twitter, is moments away from showing my artwork.
[272:47.93]The artwork that I did.
[272:54.74]Curious.
[272:56.90]I would go check it out.
[273:04.20]Alright, so this is the way to get here.
[273:05.84]That's great.
[273:06.54]It's just back.
[273:10.29]Let me hold on.
[273:10.85]Let me make sure this is my teleporter.
[273:24.92]Do you see it?
[273:25.86]Stop doing that.
[273:26.70]I just want to leave.
[273:27.55]Yeah, I did one guy.
[273:38.21]The big sword.
[273:47.82]Shows how powerful one guy can really be.
[274:09.11]Alright, so there's two options.
[274:09.95]I can either go back to the NPC city and get to the end of that and see what the hell's there, or I can just go to the end of the game.
[274:15.95]Um, it's only been like four and a half hours.
[274:18.09]I'm good.
[274:20.24]I'm definitely good just to... I mean, why not?
[274:22.42]I'll see what's at the end of it.
[274:27.68]Where'd my sword go?
[274:30.86]Uh, I wanted to go do the loot thing.
[274:33.66]I don't know what the fastest route to get there is from here, but...
[274:50.86]really good.
[274:51.46]I really need to unlock it.
[274:57.62]I think it's better than the sword.
[274:58.69]It's kind of a long way to go.
[275:06.67]Somebody please keep in mind how I get here.
[275:14.01]I'm not going to remember this.
[275:14.89]I bet your ass I'm not.
[275:31.68]Okay.
[275:32.24]So, remember, I need to go here.
[275:36.18]Eventually.
[275:36.64]Let me give you a pan.
[275:39.71]That's what's there.
[275:40.79]It's right next to the smith.
[275:44.93]Somebody remember that.
[276:02.05]Oh my god, it scales with... This is how you do it.
[276:04.51]This is how you do it.
[276:05.39]This is how you scale it with luck.
[276:07.65]This is how you scale it with luck.
[276:16.01]A thousand damage for a crit.
[276:18.39]What about the other one?
[276:29.48]I can't do it to anything else.
[276:33.47]Oh, no, no, no, no, I can take this off.
[276:35.11]Alright.
[276:36.07]But, should I just do them both luck?
[276:42.76]Because this right now is... Just do both luck.
[276:45.50]1,081 with a 13% crit rating.
[276:51.88]What?
[276:52.36]Uh-huh.
[276:52.54]Um, it's over.
[277:10.31]It paid off.
[277:11.07]Finally.
[277:11.39]I just have to figure out what that... You know, in a second and third place where that's when you know what you're doing.
[277:16.99]Alright, so now I am going to go this way.
[277:23.15]It's still a little bit more of an NPC city to explore.
[277:25.79]And that is precisely what I'm going to do.
[277:54.78]Almost 1,100, 1,200 damage.
[277:56.66]Alright, we didn't get a crit, but it was pretty cool.
[278:17.62]I hear a glitch.
[278:18.32]Glitch.
[278:24.70]Where is it?
[278:30.71]Where is it?
[278:38.00]Where is it?
[279:09.98]I think I got destroyed.
[279:10.92]I think it's probably... I don't know.
[279:16.60]On the other side?
[279:17.14]I don't know.
[279:30.67]I don't know.
[279:31.19]Maybe somebody else will figure it out one day.
[279:34.39]I don't think there are fake walls.
[279:39.28]It's probably on the outside somewhere.
[279:49.87]Like that way.
[279:50.53]Can I not walk up?
[280:04.78]Um...
[280:12.02]I can't really go that way.
[280:15.78]Alright.
[280:21.61]Alright.
[280:26.07]Anybody have any idea how fast I can get to the loot place?
[280:28.91]I don't think I even need it.
[280:34.44]I am beefed up like crazy.
[280:56.35]These crits are going to be so filthy, it's not even going to matter.
[281:10.52]Yeah, these crits are going to be filthy.
[281:14.32]Tutorial 1, Attacking.
[281:32.85]Oh, hello.
[281:37.77]Not even a crit.
[281:38.86]And it was insane.
[281:41.96]I want to see.
[281:42.40]I want a one hit kill.
[281:45.32]271 normal.
[281:48.26]Come on.
[281:55.40]That's pretty damn good.
[282:04.55]Hmm.
[282:07.11]Jeez.
[282:10.05]Tutorial 2.
[282:10.73]Ladders.
[282:13.73]Rancid crits.
[282:14.59]Just downright abhorrent crits.
[282:17.01]Disease-ridden crits.
[282:20.94]That's a good chat message.
[282:26.02]I thought it was gonna... Whatever.
[282:37.50]Jesus!
[282:51.07]Why is that there?
[282:51.61]It's going to be to remember something.
[282:54.21]Guaranteed, right?
[282:55.23]There's no way.
[282:57.98]There's no way that there's not a remembrance right here.
[283:00.12]Right?
[283:02.32]It's guaranteed.
[283:04.26]Guaranteed.
[283:11.28]Fine.
[283:12.52]Friendly NPCs.
[283:16.97]Ooh, that's creepy.
[283:18.39]Look at that.
[283:20.31]Weird.
[283:23.11]That's some game design right there.
[283:58.26]15 access.
[284:05.89]This is a really awful place to do this.
[284:18.90]I can't believe I didn't fall off.
[284:28.75]That was a lot of damage.
[284:29.67]I have to commit.
[284:47.77]I have to commit.
[284:48.95]I fucking thought he was just gonna be behind me.
[284:53.77]Shit.
[285:01.73]I don't know, dude.
[285:03.75]What a bad place to fight.
[285:07.17]He disappeared and they appear behind you and grab... Whatever.
[285:09.63]Just panicked.
[285:31.58]Bad karma.
[285:33.37]It's alright.
[285:55.62]Spawn!
[286:04.97]You see, rhythm allows the bard to play magical tunes.
[286:11.66]Rhythm allows the bard to play magical tunes.
[286:32.68]That's what I was freaking out about.
[286:39.74]High five.
[286:44.96]That's what you look like.
[286:59.09]That was 2,000 damage in one second.
[287:05.23]Let's not blow it again, please.
[287:28.57]What happened?
[287:29.69]It doesn't make any sense.
[287:30.95]Why did I just... I exploded.
[287:35.14]What the fuck?
[287:43.56]Uh, I'm not... It's so... It's such a free kill, too.
[287:46.83]That's the worst part.
[287:47.65]That's the worst part.
[288:06.22]You got stuck under the ramp?
[288:09.88]I don't know what happened.
[288:10.54]That was weird.
[288:21.97]Let's take it slow.
[288:22.83]I'm going to take it very slow.
[288:32.11]I think that is frost damage.
[288:38.00]I know what I'm best in slot.
[288:39.32]It's gonna be increases your luck by like 10%.
[288:41.91]All of heroes.
[289:05.94]I gotta get some better.
[289:07.34]End game.
[289:08.96]Trip.
[289:09.30]You know what I mean?
[289:12.38]I know.
[289:12.70]I know, dude.
[289:13.30]You're almost 40.
[289:14.60]I know.
[289:14.86]You don't have to write it.
[289:19.75]Skeleton?
[289:25.39]Kind of like the skeleton.
[289:26.13]What are the stats?
[289:28.94]16.
[289:28.96]15.
[289:32.20]No, this thing's fine.
[289:34.90]The oven bits have been really good too.
[289:36.04]57%.
[289:36.06]I kind of like it.
[290:00.80]I'm... What just... What happened to me?
[290:04.76]That was bizarre.
[290:14.70]Welcome uniform?
[290:15.72]I feel like that might be shaking here. 19.5?
[290:35.03]19.5, 7.5.
[290:35.81]I like it.
[290:49.14]What's the character's name?
[290:50.02]I actually don't know.
[290:51.24]I don't think there is a name that you just play.
[291:10.28]Oh my God.
[291:10.84]Oh, thank goodness.
[291:18.46]These enemies are so, so bad.
[291:21.58]Really?
[291:41.99]I'm dead.
[291:44.49]Oh no, I lost like 30-40,000 souls.
[291:46.47]But I'm at the end game anyways, Peter.
[291:48.62]It doesn't really matter.
[291:49.36]I think I'm going to parry these guys.
[292:24.35]Well, it wouldn't be the last area if it wasn't difficult.
[292:28.43]How long are you streaming for tonight?
[292:38.79]Until I complete this game.
[292:42.37]So whether that's 30 minutes from now, an hour from now, 10 minutes from now, this is the last area.
[292:48.82]I just have to get to the end of it.
[292:49.88]But you've seen how that's working out.
[293:04.64]I just had an intense craving for Tabasco sauce.
[293:09.14]It hit me like a ton of bricks.
[293:18.07]Just that like, oof.
[293:38.38]I like Tabasco sauce.
[293:39.36]Make a grilled cheese with Tabasco sauce.
[293:41.54]Oh.
[293:44.06]That sounds pretty damn good, actually.
[293:52.92]I didn't even have to fucking look at you.
[293:55.57]That's how good I am.
[293:56.71]Do it.
[294:06.63]Go on.
[294:16.38]That hurts so much.
[294:17.44]Where'd he go?
[294:23.41]Alright.
[294:38.55]Back to where I was.
[294:40.05]Progress.
[294:40.59]Great.
[294:41.77]I want this item.
[294:43.07]I'm going to do this.
[294:44.07]I'm not just going to leave.
[294:45.12]I want to kill this thing.
[294:56.18]That's what I should have done from the very beginning.
[295:08.53]Just checking.
[295:22.92]What the fuck is going on?
[295:24.06]What's happening?
[295:25.64]That was not fair.
[295:27.42]Where am I?
[295:29.14]What?
[295:29.36]Where'd it go?
[295:30.32]What the fuck was that?
[295:31.16]That was horseshit.
[295:32.52]Huh?
[295:36.30]Okay, okay.
[295:37.04]He literally bugged out.
[295:38.66]The character bugged the fuck out.
[295:42.72]Where did I even go?
[295:46.42]They do that thing and they teleport once behind you.
[295:48.68]They don't spam it for five seconds.
[295:57.49]And then I fall in a hole.
[296:11.92]Why even... Please win this time.
[296:15.45]It's not funny if you protect... I am about to time you out.
[296:21.57]I'm gonna reach over there.
[296:22.45]It's so much effort.
[296:25.07]I need to reach over.
[296:26.67]Click once.
[296:29.15]Scroll.
[296:30.67]Permanently ban.
[296:32.38]Click.
[296:32.80]It's two buttons.
[296:53.02]I feel like it's hard to get the actual front stab, whatever the hell it is.
[296:56.98]It's thrust.
[297:07.87]Thrust is dumb.
[297:10.25]I hate thrust weapons.
[297:11.21]I hate thrusting.
[297:13.03]There's nothing fun about it.
[297:14.07]Now you just make me... I'm so angry.
[297:18.71]I just want to kick you off a cliff.
[297:32.89]We're good.
[297:37.49]That hurt.
[297:37.93]Alright, let's go.
[297:40.60]That's what's going on.
[297:48.06]Okay.
[298:22.42]Fool me once.
[298:24.40]Shame on.
[298:26.42]Shame on you.
[298:29.21]Fool.
[298:30.41]A fool cannot be fooled again.
[299:08.05]My dad references that all the time.
[299:10.13]Alright, it's only one remains.
[299:15.20]If I went down that hole, I would have shit my pants.
[299:26.42]I'm dead.
[299:26.77]Oh my god, I'm fucking dead.
[299:31.51]I thought I went down the hole and it fucked everything up.
[299:35.30]These claw enemies.
[299:36.78]I hate these things.
[299:39.74]These things suck.
[299:42.68]They kill you in two hits.
[299:44.37]They're super fast.
[299:45.39]They can teleport.
[299:46.93]And they don't even have a body.
[299:48.41]They're just dust flying around and a pair of hands.
[299:53.49]I want that item.
[299:54.73]I'm just gonna run to it.
[299:56.31]I ain't fighting anymore.
[299:58.65]You can see my butt through the... Wait, is that... Yeah, you can.
[300:08.24]I'm just running.
[300:09.38]I'm sprinting over there.
[300:12.28]I'm not playing the game anymore.
[300:13.92]I'm just gonna run there.
[300:18.76]They can bug out all they want.
[300:36.67]Yeah, goodbye.
[300:53.12]I just have to fight one.
[301:08.09]Where did this guy come from?
[301:39.58]Where am I?
[301:59.71]Let's go.
[302:04.04]Memory of a valiant is all that was here.
[302:06.10]Come on.
[302:07.86]No way.
[302:11.98]It's definitely a remember zone, right?
[302:13.46]At least they're dead.
[302:30.60]Do your best evil laugh.
[302:31.68]Alright, I'll try.
[302:34.56]Mwahaha!
[302:56.06]Don't fall through that hole.
[303:36.96]Dude, I don't want to do that again.
[303:38.78]I don't want to run back there.
[303:40.71]That's... Come on, man.
[303:45.45]Oh, you pain in the ass.
[303:54.06]Whatever.
[303:54.42]At least I can just run by.
[304:11.95]He fell for the train.
[304:14.57]There was no choo-choo before that blew down.
[304:16.57]It just happened.
[304:20.65]There wasn't really anything for me to do.
[304:22.55]I guess maybe just block it?
[304:24.25]I could just step out of the way.
[304:25.77]I think that's what you're supposed to do and not freak out.
[304:30.51]In my brain...
[304:34.96]I thought in that split second of time that I had, if the train hit me, I was going off the map.
[304:40.68]I was like, I've been hit by this train before.
[304:44.16]It's going to knock me off the map.
[304:46.44]But let's... Will it hit them?
[304:48.52]I fucking hope so.
[304:51.48]Oh my god.
[304:59.32]I thought they despawned.
[305:07.97]I was with- why was the train?
[305:09.35]I was waiting for the train.
[305:11.05]I was waiting for the train, the train did not- I have to go try to- okay.
[305:15.69]I have to touch the lantern for the train to spawn.
[305:20.37]I thought I had to just cross a certain plane and the train would spawn if I walked past it.
[305:27.70]So, I'm gonna take it very slow and I'm gonna kill everything there.
[305:33.92]Uh, I have never really played F-Zero, somebody asked.
[305:38.39]I've not played F-Zero.
[305:42.09]Maybe a little bit when I was younger.
[305:45.28]Back in the day.
[305:49.88]I remember it being too fast.
[305:51.40]Is that wrong?
[305:55.54]No, I'm thinking of a different game.
[305:59.26]No, maybe not.
[306:00.70]I remember it being just... Everything was so fast.
[306:03.74]Okay, I kind of like hurt my head to play it.
[306:06.80]At least the old one for the Super Nintendo.
[306:36.23]How are you still alive?
[306:48.32]What?! !
[307:02.63]Thankfully, it's not midnight.
[307:03.63]It's only 1030.
[307:03.89]So, everyone that's trying to sleep.
[307:06.79]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[307:13.38]Wait, does it not happen again?
[307:14.26]I think it's just a one and done.
[307:23.90]Yeah, I think it just happens once.
[307:33.09]Consumables.
[307:36.75]We believe in you.
[307:39.25]I hate this game.
[307:40.23]I can't.
[308:04.45]They have to do the big burst.
[308:06.67]Oh my God.
[308:07.59]There's no way that I get launched that far.
[308:29.59]I went soaring.
[308:32.30]Oh, I get parry.
[308:33.98]Alright, one to beat and I fly back a thousand feet.
[308:40.73]These enemies are really tricky.
[308:42.75]I'm not going to let it beat me though.
[308:48.69]I will win.
[308:49.63]We're going to do that by simply just ignoring everything and just run to the end of the level.
[308:57.37]Check this out.
[309:00.19]I want you all to pay close attention.
[309:03.46]Class is in session.
[309:37.95]Fuck you!
[309:38.60]Uh oh.
[310:16.88]Yes!
[310:18.52]I'm out of it.
[310:19.42]Finally.
[310:28.20]Crit saved that whole thing.
[310:39.13]So I probably have enough.
[310:41.91]What does this give you?
[310:43.49]5k.
[310:48.07]Let's use everything.
[310:48.79]This is probably the last fire.
[310:56.72]I'm going to save this.
[311:02.14]Use all the crunchies.
[311:11.93]Luck.
[311:16.76]Um, wait, I gotta make sure I tether myself to here.
[311:20.72]It would be a disaster if I didn't.
[311:26.96]Alright.
[311:28.16]Let's see what is down here.
[311:31.80]It's you again.
[311:33.00]What do you got?
[311:43.72]If you want to heal the heart that actually matters, unburden her.
[311:52.19]Ooh, hold on.
[311:57.64]Right here.
[312:00.06]Is this the dead space one?
[312:02.42]No, what is it?
[312:03.90]Heart of a hero.
[312:09.07]What?
[312:10.33]Oh.
[312:15.93]Maybe I'll put it on.
[312:25.68]24% physical.
[312:28.12]Doesn't really match.
[312:45.13]Okay.
[313:23.17]I... He got, like, trapped.
[313:25.33]I heard, like, a crash.
[313:28.17]I know I'm making a lot of noises right now, but this is what happens when you're at the end of a game like this.
[313:33.43]You just revert back to caveman talk.
[314:02.32]What am I looking at?
[314:03.00]Oh shit.
[314:13.34]No shit.
[314:13.98]I'm dead.
[314:25.77]I feel like I'm 200 levels under leveled for this area.
[314:54.86]You fucking asshole.
[315:00.23]He usually goes behind.
[315:01.25]He wasn't behind me.
[315:08.62]God damn it.
[315:09.24]This place sucks.
[315:10.84]These things are so hard.
[315:13.36]You're so fucked up.
[315:18.99]They kill you in two swings.
[315:21.69]I'm not even going to describe it.
[315:24.17]It's very difficult.
[315:33.78]Their swing pattern is weird.
[315:35.98]There's two or three different kinds of these enemies.
[315:38.18]There's the ones with the claws that have horizontal swings.
[315:40.66]There's the ones with an axe or some shit.
[315:42.48]Who cares?
[315:42.75]Who cares?
[315:49.45]All this area, if you dodge, you fall off the cliff.
[315:51.59]It's a rainbow road of Dark Souls parody games.
[315:53.94]Thank you.
[316:06.17]You would milk every last ounce of decency from our world.
[316:11.03]This is not a place to fight anybody.
[316:12.59]You can't even fight in this area.
[316:14.87]You can't fight here.
[316:20.39]And we're fighting on swish cheese.
[316:41.83]Coward run.
[316:44.21]Actually, coward run time.
[316:54.52]Fuck you.
[316:56.36]Go ahead, do it.
[316:58.06]Oh, where'd it go?
[316:59.32]God damn it!
[317:14.61]No!
[317:18.71]These things are fucked up.
[317:24.93]This is the most trouble I've had in this whole 20 hours I've been playing this game.
[317:28.17]These things are relentless.
[317:47.64]Want me to get my brother?
[317:48.34]He usually plays a little better than me.
[317:54.12]Dave!
[317:56.46]Dave, come in here.
[317:57.26]Oh, yeah.
[318:02.51]What is it?
[318:02.79]What is it, Jeremy?
[318:04.63]Dave, can you help me?
[318:07.21]I'm at this area and I can't really do it.
[318:10.23]Could you just, like, kind of sit down and help me do this?
[318:12.49]Chad is making fun of me and shit.
[318:15.17]Yeah, of course.
[318:15.84]Of course I will.
[318:16.58]Let me sit down for you.
[318:18.72]Oh, let me get that controller.
[318:20.84]Here, take it, man.
[318:21.66]Thank you.
[318:23.32]No problem at all.
[318:25.72]What were you having trouble with?
[318:28.82]Oh, these enemies?
[318:29.68]Yeah, well, I... Yep, of course.
[318:34.30]All you didn't do is you didn't jump over that ledge.
[318:39.11]You see, actually avoid these enemies completely.
[318:41.13]Walk through the door.
[318:42.99]And just keep on going, Jeremy.
[318:44.31]There's no reason to stop in these areas.
[318:45.81]It's too hard.
[318:47.29]I wouldn't drop there, though.
[318:48.37]Follow you.
[318:52.33]Just head down here and make sure you never give up.
[318:55.75]That's how I do things.
[318:57.95]Well, a little bit of a glitch there.
[319:00.83]That's nothing I can't handle.
[319:07.55]I am Dave, of course.
[319:18.09]Hey, would you like the controller back?
[319:21.47]Yeah.
[319:22.77]Okay, well, here we go.
[319:24.57]Don't give up.
[319:27.09]Okay.
[319:27.63]Thanks.
[319:28.49]Thank you.
[319:29.77]I appreciate it.
[319:31.47]Oh, by the way, we're having lasagna for dinner.
[319:34.62]Oh, cool.
[319:36.54]Actually, I like that.
[319:37.66]That sounds good.
[319:38.68]Appreciate it.
[319:39.22]Thanks, man.
[319:43.10]I guess it really was that easy, but whatever.
[320:07.49]No, no, Dave, get back in here, I need you.
[320:09.94]Dave, help, Dave.
[320:23.34]Oh my God, he teleported across the thing.
[320:29.96]No, somebody help explain that to me.
[320:31.88]He teleported a... How did he do that?
[320:34.27]He was... He wasn't even... Whatever.
[320:39.31]Why am I fat rolling?
[320:40.89]Why am I fat rolling right now?
[320:44.57]What the freaking heck?
[320:47.19]I'm going to do Dave's stuff.
[320:48.55]Hold on.
[320:48.97]Dave, can you come back in here?
[320:52.26]No, you only get to use me once.
[320:54.68]And that's it.
[320:55.88]And then I want you to make sure to say hello to Sora for me.
[321:00.21]I fucking lost my mind.
[321:01.27]I'm done.
[321:01.59]I'm out of here.
[321:09.89]God damn it.
[321:10.63]I should have just... I saw the item.
[321:13.11]I saw dollar signs were in my fucking eyeballs.
[321:20.62]What?
[321:23.76]Stop shooting.
[321:24.84]You have incredible attack range.
[321:29.03]Where are they even shooting?
[321:31.83]That guy back there.
[321:33.07]That guy.
[321:33.59]That motherfucker all the way back there.
[321:35.22]The microscopic person over there.
[321:37.18]The person that is a tenth of an inch on the screen is shooting me with a homing missile across the whole game.
[321:42.54]That little microscope guy is the one that's shooting me.
[322:08.12]Let me see.
[322:08.48]Let me line that up.
[322:09.62]Yeah, right there.
[322:10.76]That sounds good.
[322:12.24]Okay, let me shoot somebody through the fucking door.
[322:39.67]What?
[322:48.77]This is brutal.
[322:49.83]This area.
[322:50.77]Okay, they turned the difficulty from like a 7 to like a 50 in this last zone.
[323:12.39]We need Dave again.
[323:13.21]No, Dave is not coming back.
[323:18.96]I am going to be as slow as shit here.
[323:21.84]Watch this.
[323:22.32]I'm going to be incredibly slow.
[323:39.56]Arrows don't do that.
[323:41.30]Arrows don't do that!
[323:43.08]Arrows don't do this!
[323:50.25]Alright, motherfucker, let's go.
[324:08.68]No crits.
[324:10.36]You gotta be shitting me.
[324:13.24]You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
[324:17.61]Why'd I even make this character?
[324:18.65]I have like a 70% crit rate.
[324:42.83]What the fuck are you doing?
[326:02.70]Jesus Christ.
[326:08.88]I played that perfectly until that last bit.
[326:12.22]Dead!
[326:31.19]Cool, thanks.
[326:33.41]Thanks for giving me extra... Get your dad.
[326:45.82]Dad!
[326:46.76]Dad, come in here.
[326:47.64]Oh, son.
[326:49.48]Something happened?
[326:51.00]What happened?
[326:52.74]Can you come and help me, Dad?
[326:54.00]Of course I'll help you.
[326:55.89]Okay, I got the controller in my hand.
[327:04.57]Thanks, Dad.
[327:04.95]Appreciate it.
[327:48.75]Somebody said, dude, your family's fucked up.
[327:53.55]Yeah, why?
[327:54.11]Alright, I have a question.
[327:55.89]Why is everybody in my family talk like this?
[328:00.36]Why don't I not have an accent like that?
[328:02.20]Why do I not have a southern accent?
[328:05.42]Why do I not talk like that?
[328:11.16]What even accent is that?
[328:18.99]It's because you're adopted.
[328:20.01]God damn it.
[328:25.53]Alright, I'm killing this thing right now.
[328:27.31]What?
[328:48.76]I told you so.
[328:54.48]Alright.
[328:55.20]Let's not blow this again.
[328:59.76]No more rolling.
[329:05.87]What the hell?
[329:12.27]Do I have three stamina?
[329:14.31]Stop freaking out.
[329:20.06]I didn't... Dude, crit somebody.
[329:22.52]I have like a 2% crit rating.
[329:26.07]Remember... Hold on a minute.
[329:31.23]Is it because I'm not swinging with this thing?
[329:32.79]I feel like I'm not hitting anybody with any crits.
[329:38.06]Is it because I'm not using the offhand?
[329:57.10]Dude, I really hope the last boss is a slug.
[330:01.66]Where is he?
[330:04.22]Dude, I... Fuck you, I'm just running.
[330:08.70]I do want that though.
[330:28.89]Yes!
[330:40.10]Oh, it's you.
[330:41.68]We've come a long way, my friend.
[330:44.22]Seems cycles ago that I doubted my destiny.
[330:48.13]You gave me focus.
[330:49.57]Not once, but twice.
[330:52.07]Nero does not forget those who embrace him.
[330:55.37]Before us lies a quest, akin to the one we began together so long ago.
[331:00.83]I hid behind your shield back then.
[331:03.65]I concealed my self-doubt with bravado.
[331:06.69]Will you fight beside me as allies and equals?
[331:11.12]I'm going to be really honest with you.
[331:13.34]I'm going to just, you're going to take aggro and I'm not going to even fight because these things are hard and I don't even care if you die.
[331:21.16]I thought so.
[331:22.56]Prove our destinies.
[331:36.56]Pull it back here.
[331:37.06]Pull it back here.
[331:37.68]Pull it back here.
[331:39.06]Did I just aggro that accidentally?
[331:42.30]No, you've got to be shitting me.
[331:43.34]I didn't... I was trying to... I was targeted on... This is not good.
[331:48.34]Just spam.
[331:49.06]Spam.
[331:49.34]It'll work.
[331:49.66]Okay.
[331:53.80]Okay.
[331:54.04]Okay.
[331:54.16]Okay.
[331:58.79]Alright.
[331:59.13]We're good.
[331:59.87]That's what we do.
[332:00.53]Teamwork.
[332:01.05]We're good.
[332:01.59]I believed in you all along.
[332:06.50]heroes don't look to their world for acceptance heroes change their world to accept them that was very helpful I'm so can you imagine
[332:19.50]Let's put this out there right now.
[332:21.22]Can you imagine if this guy did not do the quest?
[332:25.12]He would not be standing there right now, and I would be in a lot of trouble.
[332:30.28]I definitely would not have done that.
[332:32.36]I only did that because this character is here.
[332:34.62]So if you're going to play this game, let me give you a very big piece of advice.
[332:40.51]Do this quest.
[332:43.15]This guy's very helpful.
[332:49.92]Something new though.
[332:53.52]Oh, it's a Dex weapon.
[332:56.20]What?
[333:01.24]And it's got a ton of damage.
[333:07.41]And it looks super cool.
[333:16.41]What's the damage on?
[333:17.15]Let's see.
[333:20.82]80 plus 141.
[333:21.38]I mean, this is just better.
[333:27.73]Alright.
[333:29.63]Let's go.
[333:30.07]I don't know what's next, but it's time to move forward.
[333:39.42]Where is Ford?
[333:53.64]Go back down here.
[334:30.40]How do I get out of here?
[334:30.94]Tactics.
[335:03.34]Look at all these holes.
[335:05.52]Fuck you.
[335:06.26]Oh my god.

[336:00.45]This is locked.
[336:01.61]Help.
[336:02.29]Get me out of this area.
[336:04.47]Okay.
[336:04.69]Alright.
[336:04.97]I'm fine.
[336:05.35]I'm fine.
[336:06.25]Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go.

[336:09.97]Alright.
[336:10.36]Cool.
[336:11.32]Sweet.
[336:11.54]Huh?
[336:17.67]What the fuck are you doing?
[336:22.00]I can't get in this door.
[336:23.40]I can't get in that.
[336:24.02]Okay, so calm down.
[336:25.04]Everything's fine.
[336:25.92]Climb this.
[336:28.42]No, I was just there.
[336:45.40]That was horrible.
[336:48.32]I cannot die here.
[336:50.30]You know what I mean?
[336:50.98]Like this would be a disaster if I died.
[336:52.78]Oh, that's pretty funny.
[337:32.15]Cool.
[337:37.71]Somebody can read that later.
[337:38.59]Can you mention lasagna again?
[337:50.12]Did you actually want lasagna for dinner?
[337:55.14]Oh, yeah.
[337:57.10]Sounds awesome.
[338:00.10]Sounds perfectly delicious.
[338:04.69]Um... Which way do I go?
[338:07.21]Fuck you.
[338:33.49]Oh, fuck you.
[338:35.75]Oh, yeah, good.
[338:37.09]That was actually smart game development to make somebody lose.
[338:43.57]Good thing I'm even awful at rolling into inanimate objects.
[338:48.25]Treasure or... Yeah, come on.
[339:13.63]What?
[339:25.49]This way.
[339:31.44]This is the troll zone.
[339:32.68]I am not messing around here.
[339:33.94]Not anymore.
[339:34.76]This is legit though.
[339:37.12]Like we're just messing with you now.
[339:57.09]Thank God it's real.
[340:02.64]Thank goodness.
[340:10.52]That part with the train and dropping the ground out with the cows and the troll drops.
[340:17.70]Oh man, that's, uh, that's rough.
[340:22.04]I'm so shocked I actually got through that.
[340:25.52]That was a mess.
[340:40.47]The live zone oh, I'm live over here
[341:09.18]Like if I didn't turn into the thingy.
[341:11.68]I don't know why I'm parrying.
[341:27.96]Dude, I can't.
[341:30.00]Get that light out of my face.
[341:48.61]See you later.
[341:50.41]See you later.
[341:52.69]Goodbye.
[341:53.05]Okay.
[341:59.05]Okay.
[342:08.74]Isn't it already out here?
[342:10.98]No.
[342:11.14]No.
[342:16.41]No, you should have waited.
[342:18.07]My signal is gathering up.
[342:21.19]Hmm.
[342:43.11]I'm so curious about how that actually works.
[342:45.86]There's a lot of blocked doors.
[342:48.76]Maybe some kind of key or something.
[342:50.64]I don't know.
[343:00.83]I'm not moving through that.
[343:07.55]There we go.
[343:29.94]Go flat on the castle.
[343:32.30]Oh, that's actually a pretty good idea.
[343:41.72]Bro, what are you... How does it miss?
[343:53.21]Don't fuck off with this shit!
[343:58.99]Whoa!
[343:59.53]I'm not gonna let you blow this for me, no way.
[344:35.12]Crit him!
[344:36.70]Jesus!
[344:38.92]Crit the bastard!
[344:40.20]Come on, Mr. Knight.
[344:46.31]You're so loud.
[344:47.65]What do you want me to do?
[344:48.71]I can't just sit here and not be loud.
[344:54.17]My whole life flashes before my eyes every time one of those enemies swings.
[345:17.74]Shut up, buddy.
[345:30.65]Flee!
[345:31.45]Flee from your doom!
[345:33.07]I always see you.
[345:39.97]Train!
[345:40.61]Here it comes!
[345:55.05]Damn, that's a pretty big shortcut.
[346:01.41]Keep of the stolen crown.
[346:04.60]Locked of the castle.
[346:08.54]Um, let me unlock this first because I don't want to die, but you know, we'll see.
[346:49.72]Wait, where are we?
[346:54.61]Wait a minute.
[347:01.21]This is a shortcut to back here?
[347:06.27]Uh.
[347:09.51]Oh.
[347:14.88]Well, let me level up.
[347:43.23]Okay.
[347:45.63]So... I gotta go back.
[347:58.64]Should I... make this... Should I tether here?
[348:02.44]Because if I have the shortcut there, I feel like I don't have to run through a bunch of bullshit, right?
[348:08.32]It's probably a good idea.
[348:11.26]Yeah, I'm doing it.
[348:39.13]We are painfully close.
[348:42.21]We are almost there.
[348:47.99]Then where do I go from here?
[348:53.05]This game is a lot longer than I thought it was going to be.
[348:56.74]This is the second or third stream of this game.
[349:00.68]Five, six hours each.
[349:05.93]15 to 20 hour game.
[349:07.51]I'm surprised.
[349:08.01]I thought it was going to be like 10.
[349:09.09]That's cool.
[349:20.17]Okay, so this is where I ended up.
[349:32.32]In there.
[349:34.37]Part of the sequence.
[349:36.61]Um... Up, maybe?
[349:41.81]Okay, yep.
[349:44.09]No.
[349:45.98]No.
[349:48.48]No!
[349:51.10]No!
[350:03.34]narrator's pocket watch this is a weapon nine source cool
[350:35.05]How do I get up there?
[350:49.55]Hmm.
[350:52.52]Okay.
[350:52.78]Is somebody hiding right there?
[350:55.14]That's how I go back, to the right.
[350:59.11]I don't think it's in here.
[351:01.53]Is it out there?
[351:10.55]Fuck you.
[351:11.05]Yeah, how do you like that?
[351:21.38]Eat shit.
[351:23.68]Eat shit.
[351:25.62]You can't teleport up here.
[351:27.50]And you don't even know how to use the ladder.
[351:46.18]Over there.
[351:47.04]Yeah.
[351:56.84]Straight ahead.
[352:16.83]Not a single crit to be had.
[352:26.04]What?
[352:26.54]I was out of the way.
[352:28.88]Complain, complain, complain, complain, complain, complain, complain.
[352:33.28]Where, where, where?
[353:13.26]God damn it, another one, come on!
[353:19.40]What is it doing?
[353:27.13]They really do not want me to go all the way over here.
[353:30.81]They just, they so badly don't want me to go through this door.
[353:45.59]Does this thing teleport?
[353:46.61]I think it does.
[353:47.03]I am not... We are going back to where I can actually hit you.
[354:01.49]Idiot.
[354:07.44]Would you see the substance of what you are?
[354:09.72]Then come to me.
[354:10.16]It's gonna be fake.
[354:39.26]That's going to be fake.
[354:39.90]It's not fake.
[354:54.49]One more point.
[354:55.07]What should I put it into?
[354:59.95]Has there ever been a fake one?
[355:01.07]There has been one or two fake ones.
[355:03.59]Just luck again.
[355:05.55]We might as well go all in.
[355:13.21]I wonder what the caps are in this game.
[355:14.65]They might not even be any caps.
[355:17.09]Find out.
[355:20.23]New luck ability.
[355:21.29]Well, that was a good idea.
[355:26.10]Recover health on critical hit.
[355:30.30]Take no damage.
[355:31.66]Well, too bad we didn't get that.
[355:37.55]That's actually really good.
[355:42.78]Alright, game.
[355:44.90]It's time for you to show us what the deal is.
[355:53.47]Big reveal.
[356:00.30]Gonna be slug.
[356:01.50]One hit.
[356:03.60]I hate you.
[356:06.66]And I do know what you are.
[356:10.55]Let me spin a tale to show you.
[356:16.43]Your journey here was easy.
[356:24.50]See?
[356:25.58]Nostalgaia holds her hero's hands.
[356:29.61]But what if the story had held nothing back?
[356:37.43]Uh, okay.
[356:54.05]I tried to turn into the thing.
[356:55.29]It's just B without pressing any other buttons, right?
[357:15.33]Ouch.
[357:22.25]I just got triple tapped.
[357:24.43]I got triple tapped because of this fucking sausage behind me.
[357:28.83]This cigar behind me blocked me from going backwards.
[357:47.63]your journey here was easy alright bring it on string it together give me like three more of those there it is that's why you build luck
[358:17.35]Okay.
[358:17.57]Momma!
[358:52.47]This doesn't seem right.
[358:53.15]Hmm?
[358:55.67]Hmm?
[359:32.44]Oh, that hurts a lot.
[360:00.90]That's annoying.
[360:01.56]Why can't I get the front stab?
[360:21.34]Three hits is good.
[360:27.25]Give me a couple crits.
[360:30.83]There it is, that was weird.
[360:31.77]Did that even hurt?
[360:34.65]Planted, but no.
[360:47.96]GG.
[360:50.22]Were it only so easy, everything I love destroyed by heroes.
[361:02.65]There's nothing left to tell.
[361:05.57]Oh, shit.
[361:12.66]You just got fucking destroyed.
[361:18.29]Still alive?
[361:42.51]You obliterated him so hard he can't even move.
[361:47.29]I fucked him up so bad.
[361:48.73]Oh no, I kind of feel bad.
[361:55.28]I smushed him in the head so hard.
[361:59.44]I-
[362:09.18]I have hated what I feared you were.
[362:13.24]A hero.
[362:16.56]This story is no longer mine to tell.
[362:21.23]If ye truly be different than the rest of your kind, go to my study.
[362:28.73]Find the plot threads therein and sever them.
[362:36.80]Make your
[362:47.41]Uh-oh.
[363:08.61]Plot thread scissors.
[363:12.75]Wait.
[363:14.43]That's a dex weapon, isn't it?
[363:22.36]Kind of.
[363:24.14]Not really.
[363:24.75]Damn, okay.
[363:33.23]Level up.
[363:49.10]I need to kill, like, one thing.
[363:58.41]Oh, no, it's whatever.
[364:04.02]Wait, watch this video?
[364:05.76]What video?
[364:07.54]It was me, Barry.
[364:10.56]I killed your favorite... Wait, what is this?
[364:14.42]Scroll up.
[364:24.79]It was me, Jerma.
[364:26.43]I made the final level of this game harder so you wouldn't be able to beat it, making your sleep schedule a little bit more difficult.
[364:33.86]Difficult enough for me to kill Vinny.
[364:39.76]What?
[364:40.12]What is that?
[364:42.30]What character is that?
[364:43.61]What characters are these?
[364:45.95]Who's this mustard guy?
[364:53.21]I don't know who this is.
[365:06.63]Alright, let's end this.
[365:08.55]It's reverse flash?
[365:18.59]Is reverse flash just really slow and lazy?
[365:22.02]It better be.
[365:24.86]To me, reverse flash is an insult.
[365:33.73]Like, alright, reverse flash.
[365:35.23]It's like, fuck off, man.
[365:36.85]It's my day off today.
[365:40.42]Oh, really?
[365:41.06]Got up at 1pm, huh?
[365:43.04]Reverse flash?
[365:44.76]Shut up.
[365:57.71]Alright.
[365:59.05]Go to my study.
[366:01.89]Where is that?
[366:02.47]Is that the big thing that we've been seeing underneath, um... You know what I'm talking about, right?
[366:09.59]Where is that?
[366:18.14]Go to my study.
[366:24.58]Remember heroism?
[366:31.06]Cool.
[366:33.96]With the train.
[366:35.26]Oh, the train hole.
[366:36.72]That's right.
[366:38.30]Now, I'm going to need a little bit of help because it's been a very long time.
[366:42.84]That's like down in one of the first area, like the second or third area.
[366:49.97]Staging room.
[366:55.03]Anybody know?
[366:55.43]Okay.
[367:04.20]Actually, let me level up one more time.
[367:05.40]I'm gonna have enough in a second.
[367:19.21]Obliterated.
[367:20.07]The left room, go behind the elevator.
[367:38.25]Thinking back.
[367:39.00]Wait, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[367:41.14]I just don't remember.
[367:42.02]Alright, I'm standing here.
[367:43.90]I would like the precise directions.
[367:53.42]Left.
[367:53.66]Okay.
[367:55.85]Behind the elevator.
[368:00.43]Okay.
[368:06.93]Very cool.
[368:08.41]And then down here.
[368:11.47]How the hell did you know that?
[368:17.21]Now, isn't it down here somewhere?
[368:23.88]Wrong.
[368:27.58]Some guy said he would unsub if you don't play Skyrim.
[368:32.09]Alright.
[368:35.00]Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[368:37.58]No help.
[368:38.80]Yes, help.
[368:46.59]Staging room in the tutorial area.
[368:48.67]Okay, so where is that?
[368:52.43]There's been a lot of twists and a lot of turns.
[368:54.93]A lot of twists and turns.
[368:58.68]A lot of doors.
[368:59.54]A lot of things to remember.
[369:00.46]A lot of openings.
[369:01.16]A lot of places to go.
[369:03.04]A lot of things to see.
[369:04.36]A lot of things to do.
[369:05.32]A lot of places to look at.
[369:07.69]A lot of enemies to attack.
[369:10.37]A lot of things to do.
[369:11.65]A lot of things to be.
[369:12.41]A lot of places to see.
[369:13.31]Found it.
[369:41.34]Correct?
[369:46.48]Oh, yes!
[369:47.33]No!
[370:08.28]What's going on in here?
[370:11.84]Definitely remember something.
[370:15.08]Yep.
[370:17.75]What is this?
[370:23.83]Strength.
[370:26.54]The memory saber.
[370:27.72]Cool.
[370:30.64]Cool.
[370:35.03]And there was a problem.
[371:10.54]Anything else?
[371:17.41]It's a cool room.
[371:20.83]Alright.
[371:22.09]The time has come.
[371:24.29]Me to go level up.
[371:56.58]Lightsaber, bro, use it.
[371:57.65]I don't have enough strength.
[372:00.73]You know what?
[372:03.21]You can do that in your playthrough.
[372:07.47]I might... Maybe not on stream, but I might play through this again with... Oh my god, I need like 100.
[372:12.90]I kind of want to do the... Spellcasting.
[372:30.11]Come on, give me another.
[372:35.02]Play it with a friend.
[372:38.94]I don't think there's multiplayer in this game.
[372:40.92]I think it's a lot.
[372:42.66]I think it's just the signs.
[372:49.43]The game is full co-op.
[372:50.59]Are you serious?
[372:54.85]It's two player co-op.
[372:59.55]I did not know that.
[373:00.89]Okay.
[373:11.81]That's enough.
[373:12.88]One more point in luck.
[373:14.44]Just for good luck.
[373:45.78]Finish it.
[373:46.14]This game seriously is one of the better soulslikes I've seen.
[373:51.60]Yeah, it is.
[373:58.07]I am pleasantly surprised by how fun this game actually is.
[374:01.75]I want this to be really cinematic, so please leave me alone in here.
[374:19.24]Alright, let's get it cinematic.
[374:22.10]Is this what I'm rocking with?
[374:23.04]Is this the final clothing?
[374:24.02]Yep.
[375:46.70]Reminds me of the Sekiro noise.
[375:48.61]That actually might be the Sekiro noise.
[376:17.49]Okay, who's next?
[376:19.15]Gauntlet?
[376:19.57]Let's go.
[376:19.89]What do you got?
[376:24.75]Sit down.
[376:27.21]Who's up?
[376:28.05]Who's up?
[376:32.34]Oh, what?
[376:56.27]What you doing, man?
[377:04.10]One final shortcut.
[377:26.64]I know there's a bonfire here, closer.
[377:28.28]Alright, so where is the closest bonfire to here?
[377:52.37]Up.
[377:59.04]Alright, back here.
[378:03.36]No, back here.
[378:09.25]Where am I going?
[378:15.39]Other way?
[378:22.58]Up the stairs?
[378:32.17]I would like to go to the smith one more time.
[378:34.15]If I could.
[378:38.95]Oh, you guys are so helpful.

[385:39.67]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[385:45.09]It's all about parries.
[385:46.49]Parry, but I feel like I can't... I can't get the crit.
[385:50.72]Even if I go in the right spot.
[385:51.74]It's kind of buggy.
[385:52.92]Kind of finicky.
[385:54.60]It's like weird.
[385:55.26]I'll parry and then it's like I go right up the front.
[385:57.36]I don't get it.
[386:04.78]You're moving to the side?
[386:05.54]I started moving to the side because it wouldn't work in the front.
[386:34.33]You're a caster?
[386:35.03]Holy shit, she has spells.
[387:32.84]Come on.

[389:34.35]It's like, it's like, it's such a tiny little window in some random spot that I just don't understand.
[389:55.32]That's as close as I can get.
[389:56.18]I got it once and weirdly like the character went like to the left a little.
[390:00.99]I have no idea.
[390:29.04]Alright, let's fucking go.
[390:30.18]Come on.
[390:38.79]That's what I- That's- That's- And that's how I'm supposed to start this.
[390:48.98]See?
[390:50.04]Where were those?
[390:50.50]I've been looking for those for fucking years.
[390:54.38]It's been years.
[391:08.42]That's what I'm talking about.
[391:09.30]That's what I mean.
[391:09.90]Aggression.
[391:10.41]Aggressive only.
[391:11.49]Sekiro taught me that.
[391:12.89]What did he say?
[391:14.17]Overconfidence could be a slow and insidious.
[391:17.98]Make sure you kill fast.
[391:24.70]That's weird.
[391:25.22]I'm telling you.
[391:53.08]I wanted to, oh, oops.
[392:17.34]Get out of my domain!
[392:28.18]Who's next?
[392:33.32]What?
[392:37.53]Are they all gonna attack me at the same time?
[392:39.17]I thought they were all gonna run in.
[392:56.02]Just check, right?
[392:57.82]Not a bad idea.
[393:00.80]That was intense.
[393:04.72]Whoa, whoa, why is it counting?
[393:06.14]24, 25... 26, what's going on?
[393:07.36]27, 28... What?
[393:07.62]That was weird.
[393:10.20]Did all those people die?
[393:39.42]Weird.
[393:48.18]Let's check.
[394:29.40]Huh.
[394:31.26]Okay.
[394:31.48]I don't know.
[394:41.87]Sometimes I put weird stuff over here.
[394:45.25]My body!
[394:46.19]My back hurts.
[394:47.87]My head hurts.
[394:49.81]My thighs hurt somehow.
[394:52.70]My fucking whole body hurts right now.
[395:19.11]New order, new order.
[395:21.87]What was all that?
[395:26.53]New orders rule.
[395:27.83]I think it's heavy as hell.
[395:41.18]Okay.
[396:24.96]Those are the strings, right?
[396:48.54]It's loud.
[396:49.83]LOUD!
[396:52.87]This game is tur- I turned it down too.
[396:55.43]Where is that?
[396:59.99]Where the hell is that?
[397:01.17]That was a demon face.
[397:02.35]Does anybody remember what that is?
[397:03.55]It's in the demon room?
[397:19.55]Buy this shop.
[397:23.36]Yeah.
[397:27.14]It's in hell with the pink guy.
[397:28.86]The shop at the market square.
[397:36.88]Market square.
[397:37.84]Yeah.
[397:43.72]Yeah.
[397:58.21]Second area of the game.
[398:02.11]Can somebody give me directions?
[398:06.36]What was that?
[399:01.12]Alright.
[399:04.84]Where am I going?
[399:06.07]I don't know, man.
[399:08.33]I don't know.
[399:09.05]I don't know where I'm going.
[399:10.03]I know what to do.
[399:21.85]These guys don't hurt that much, it's alright.
[399:31.12]Homeward bone?
[399:32.88]That's exactly what I was thinking.
[399:42.67]Carry on down the path by the shop.
[399:44.19]There's a trek down a snowy mountain with some tough monsters for this early in the game.
[399:47.51]Make it to the bottom though and there's a cave.
[400:01.45]This can be remembered here.
[400:06.79]Let me use my points.
[400:15.03]There we go.
[400:16.57]What's the one of the last luck abilities with something crazy, right?
[400:22.48]Take no damage.
[400:28.78]there's a one percent chance that I don't take damage whenever I get hit or what these percentages mean okay so it's guys I'm standing here which way
[401:05.12]Seeing behind you.
[401:06.56]Behind you.
[401:10.02]There's only one shop in the game.
[401:11.50]Yeah, but this was three days ago.
[401:15.98]It may as well have never happened.
[401:28.61]Wait, what about this thing down here?
[401:34.35]I'm curious about this.
[401:35.07]Where are my friends?
[401:43.52]I'm not too proud to admit you've taught me much, old friend.
[401:48.57]Rules cannot prevent a hero from fulfilling their destiny.
[401:52.82]We were not spawned accepted, so we surpassed expectation.
[401:57.60]Look upon me now, Great Ones.
[402:00.43]Look and tremble!
[402:06.03]I will face the Pipe Lair.
[402:09.38]I make my own destiny I may alright what about you I have literally only two people made it no three gone off script have you most noble heroes follow the path prescribed between you and I I do not know how heroic that truly is a single great one yet remains between you and an open heart the pipe layer
[402:33.59]Pipe layer.
[402:33.87]Okay.
[402:33.97]Alright.
[402:34.19]Alright.
[402:34.47]I'm standing here.
[402:35.07]Where from here?
[402:35.62]Actually, let me look down.
[402:36.80]I want to see this thing.
[403:21.15]Okay.
[403:22.75]Alright, standing here.
[403:24.13]Where do I go from here?
[403:33.38]Left.
[403:40.51]My cat just got sprayed by a skunk.
[403:42.47]Oh, that sucks.
[403:43.25]I'm sorry.
[403:44.53]That's horrible.
[403:46.07]Oh, no.
[403:47.09]That's not good.
[403:57.26]Oh no.
[403:57.72]Oh, hope they're alright.
[404:03.58]That's probably pretty scary.
[404:25.33]Oh, I think I remember now.
[404:38.00]That guy that's chained up, right?
[404:40.16]He's like, oh, I had to chain myself to the wall, right?
[404:44.52]Hold on.
[404:53.36]I'm going to actually put it here.
[405:04.59]He's like...
[405:06.17]Where are you?
[405:06.75]He's over here in that weird spot where?
[405:13.94]Where is this guy?
[405:17.26]Place with the big statue sits in the middle.
[405:42.61]Where the fuck am I going?
[405:44.73]I'm gonna level up one more time.
[406:07.54]Is 12 something?
[406:15.17]I hope that's enough.
[406:25.76]Oh, come on.
[406:26.64]I wish there was a counter that just counted down to your next level.
[406:30.97]It's like, oh, hey, ding, you can do it now.
[407:07.89]Alright, let's go.
[407:15.98]Hooray.
[407:17.64]Never opened that.
[407:48.10]I heard the blacksmith.
[407:48.84]I kind of wanted to maybe look for him, but... Okay, I gotta go.
[407:52.47]Wait, leave me alone.
[407:53.17]I gotta go down.
[408:00.05]Why even attack me?
[408:00.87]I can kill you all in one hit.
[408:06.25]Okay, I want to get down there.
[408:07.43]I gotta go this way.
[408:13.99]Wait, no.
[408:14.67]What?
[408:39.37]Bro, how the fuck?
[408:54.35]Okay, come on.
[408:56.55]This better not kill me or I will scream.
[408:59.87]I can't even do it anyways.
[409:01.38]Okay.
[409:12.55]So what was going on in here?
[409:18.27]Past here through here.
[409:34.28]Kill this guy now that it's the end of the game.
[409:45.83]Can't talk to the shopkeeper anymore.
[409:50.41]I cannot talk.
[410:03.16]Oh.
[410:13.27]Do it.
[410:17.62]Need to go to sleep.
[410:18.68]I am perfectly fine.
[410:25.65]For some reason I thought I was out of the hitbox.
[410:52.62]Disgraced glare.
[410:57.91]This looks awful.
[411:04.93]Cheese ball it.
[411:19.62]See, I'm surprised how this game is really big.
[411:24.27]It's very, it's huge.
[411:36.31]Oh God, here it is.
[411:47.19]Okay.
[411:48.65]Alright.
[411:49.75]Alright.
[411:50.37]Yeah.
[411:51.37]Yeah, sure.
[411:55.28]Oh, get out of here.
[411:57.96]Come on.
[412:03.02]I got a weapon, though.
[412:08.47]Strength?
[412:08.81]Let's remember it.
[412:19.44]Demon Tearjerker.
[412:25.96]Damn.
[412:33.74]Giga Chad!
[412:34.38]Giga Chad!
[412:35.22]Giga Chad!
[412:35.84]Fuck.
[412:40.22]Wait, that's far away!
[412:42.58]Am I crazy?
[412:43.46]That's very- That's really far away, isn't it?
[412:54.00]No way.
[412:54.92]I don't-
[412:57.48]No, no, no.
[412:57.80]Okay, it's not that bad.
[412:59.02]That sucks, though.
[413:03.64]For some reason, I thought I had a close bonfire.
[413:06.02]Oh, man.
[413:06.84]That would have been awesome if I had made it, though.
[413:29.31]um shit it's alright it's alright everything's fine um okay why does Jerma need to sleep if he's not real
[413:58.94]Didn't we just talk about how painfully unfunny that is now?
[414:10.67]Don't hurt me, please!
[414:16.90]Wait!
[414:18.26]It's 500 bucks, I can't open it!
[414:28.02]There's this many people in here.
[414:29.92]There's not even this many people in the whole game.
[414:31.75]There's not this many people in the entire game.
[414:53.76]My sword's broken.
[414:56.17]My sword's facing the wrong way.
[414:57.69]It swings down now.
[414:59.72]God damn it.
[415:00.66]Why does this have to happen to me?
[415:02.10]Okay.
[415:15.97]Please put the sword in your hand correctly.
[415:17.45]That would be fantastic.
[415:33.70]What's behind there?
[415:40.38]Holy shit!
[415:46.94]This is actually kind of sad.
[415:54.95]You must gather your party before... That's, like, really sad.
[416:01.43]They all died in here.
[416:04.28]What's this?
[416:06.92]A suspicious spoon.
[416:15.48]That's kind of incredible.
[416:45.85]Wait, what is he doing there?
[416:52.39]He's just hanging out down there.
[416:53.39]What?
[417:07.17]Okay, can you... I'm done with that enemy.
[417:12.41]Is there a place I can just drop down?
[417:20.15]I wish I could just jump off the fucking edge here.
[417:22.07]Like, why do I have to run around in a goddamn circle?
[417:28.76]Is he gonna lead me out?
[417:29.44]Oh, fuck off.
[417:54.94]Okay, um... Let me find the one door to go through to get down here.
[418:02.22]Just let me jump!
[418:05.36]Where the hell... You ran past the drop-down point?
[418:20.37]It's over there.
[418:37.59]Screw you.
[419:09.97]I wonder what actually happens if you... There's probably like a few different endings, I'm imagining.
[419:15.44]Because that little dude just keeps showing up and telling me to do that.
[419:22.76]Maybe if you unburden a certain amount of items?
[419:24.42]That makes sense.
[419:38.71]Okay, I really have to be very careful here.
[419:41.21]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[419:42.37]I'm not going to make a Giga Chad fall joke.
[419:45.30]I wasn't even trying to.
[419:46.24]There's no bonfire down here.
[420:01.40]I'm going to go as slow as possible.
[420:29.02]Alright.
[420:30.16]I'm taking all my gear off.
[420:32.88]So I can dodge roll super fast if I need to.
[420:43.86]Is it under 25 maybe?
[420:45.24]I wonder if this is like a really crazy one.
[420:47.12]Okay.
[420:51.88]No gear.
[420:53.72]Super quick.
[420:55.10]I got a very, very good start.
[420:56.73]Let's go.
[421:06.95]Please pray for me.
[421:34.49]The ball, don't be deceived by that ball.
[421:40.35]Dude, this thing, I don't know when to go.
[421:42.97]Um, now?
[421:48.22]Uh, now.
[421:50.40]Holy shit, I made it.
[421:51.50]Okay.
[422:02.10]Alright.
[422:03.16]Alright.
[422:03.44]Alright.
[422:03.72]Alright.
[422:04.24]Sweet.
[422:04.74]Very sweet.
[422:05.28]Very cool.
[422:14.77]Let me put my gear back on.
[422:16.05]That would be helpful.
[422:22.25]What is this thing?
[422:37.45]75.
[422:37.73]Damn it.
[422:38.47]Right at 75.
[422:38.73]Damn it.
[422:39.23]Alright, that's good.
[422:52.33]Um... Just play it safe.
[422:58.63]Don't be dumb.
[422:59.73]I need a bonfire.
[423:00.51]Oh, yeah.
[423:03.49]Yeah.
[423:06.19]So is this a whole nother area?
[423:07.71]Oh my God.
[423:12.09]I thought I, I didn't think the game was going to be that much longer.
[423:14.67]This is like a whole nother zone.
[423:17.48]Damn.
[423:26.12]I'm still into it.
[423:27.52]No, I'm, I'm good.
[423:32.22]I'm having this game.
[423:33.38]I love this game.
[423:44.29]They're so thin, too.
[423:45.35]It's hard to even see where they're going.
[423:59.85]I'm sorry.
[424:01.97]I'm fucked here.
[424:03.01]Give me that item, please.
[424:08.64]Yes.
[424:28.40]There's got gas everywhere.
[424:29.64]Dude of this is this is fucking terrifying.
[424:36.78]Yikes.
[425:03.00]Giga Chad.
[425:03.56]Giga Chad.
[425:07.00]Oh my goodness.
[425:30.46]Holy shit.
[425:42.38]Oh, dear.
[425:42.76]What if I go?
[425:51.86]And that's a dead that you just die.
[426:10.05]How come that?
[426:10.45]Why do you think that was a good idea?
[426:12.77]Um, I think mainly it was because there was nowhere else for me to go.
[426:17.40]And I'm like, where should I go?
[426:19.40]Like, maybe I'll go there.
[426:23.87]Maybe there was a secret.
[426:25.69]Who knows?
[426:26.03]Maybe there could have been like a treasure or something you fall through.
[426:28.73]It's a Dark soulslike parody secrets game.
[426:34.45]Of course, there's going to be interesting things to do.
[426:39.01]Holy.
[426:43.01]That's not over there.
[426:49.67]Dude, why?
[426:51.05]I just watched the same movie.
[426:53.91]I just saw the same movie.
[426:58.79]And this movie stinks.
[427:14.11]That's just, you're just mean at that point.
[427:16.42]You just did that, you're making like a funny joke that I just got hit by that.
[427:19.28]Well, guess who doesn't think it's funny?
[427:22.16]Me.
[427:31.94]Where's the ball?
[427:33.52]Alright, maybe I'm going to go this way.
[427:49.35]Jesus, what was that?
[427:54.35]Where am I?
[427:56.05]What's happening?
[427:57.77]What is this?
[427:58.17]Is this supposed to be Doom?
[427:59.61]Doom?
[428:03.58]I just got the... I... Huh?
[428:19.21]Am I making progress?
[428:27.20]I... I think so.
[428:37.81]Oh no, what's that mean?
[428:41.54]Dude, can- What the fuck is happening?
[428:58.77]Not a chance in hell, by the way.
[429:01.21]I- Holy shit!
[429:11.37]Why does this guy have a weight on him?
[429:15.52]Dude, this place is fucking ridiculous.
[429:18.60]I don't even know how I got over... There was so much happening.
[429:29.68]I don't even know how I got over there.
[429:31.78]I have no idea.
[429:32.84]I picked up a red shirt.
[429:36.17]Hey, you should slow down.
[429:41.47]Are you?
[429:42.75]Are we on the same channel here?
[429:44.87]Do you see what just happened?
[429:50.54]Look at these balls.
[429:51.72]They throw these balls at every fucking angle.
[430:24.54]Okay, I still...
[430:45.59]This is a joke level.
[430:47.35]This is a joke level.
[430:48.63]They made this specifically... A dev is watching this right now going like, oh, wait, he's not supposed to be here.
[430:54.42]This level sucks.
[430:57.86]I made this just... I just was fucking around on a Saturday afternoon.
[431:41.90]Why can't he get hit by the ball?
[432:28.25]Stop what happened Which is somebody just pushing me and hitting me with a hammer in the head It's too many sound effects um
[433:00.22]Bad dream.
[433:04.04]I got some new shit here I. Damn it, it's deck strength.
[433:29.67]10,000.
[433:29.72]No thanks.
[434:03.22]Alright.
[434:05.14]Now what?
[434:08.08]Is it up?
[434:09.85]I feel like it's up.
[434:23.77]Didn't I just go up?
[434:25.98]I did, but I think I fell.
[434:27.18]I think someone hit me down.
[434:27.92]Fuck.
[434:29.94]Fuck.
[434:34.50]Wait.
[434:38.26]Um.
[434:42.32]I don't know.
[434:44.30]Was I right?
[434:57.55]I don't know.
[434:58.85]I feel like I've been pretty much everywhere.
[435:14.50]Just keep going down.
[435:15.34]I'm going to die.
[435:43.11]Found it.
[435:52.53]Serious.
[436:02.10]Is it a Minecraft portal?
[436:03.28]That's cool.
[436:11.58]Take the lift now.
[436:21.00]I'm afraid of that ball.
[436:24.74]Waffles versus pancakes.
[436:25.84]I don't like either one of them.
[436:30.67]If I had to choose, it would be pancakes.
[436:32.91]No, that's not true.
[436:33.61]It would be waffles.
[436:35.90]I'm not a big fan of either one of them.
[437:00.60]Okay.
[437:02.32]So this way to the left or to the right?
[437:06.20]I gotta go.
[437:06.76]That's the only place I really haven't been.
[437:08.12]Alright, so now what?
[437:21.85]Oh my god.
[437:29.78]Okay, don't move.
[437:38.13]Okay, up again.
[437:39.69]I don't want to get hit by a ball.
[437:51.69]No, man, look at all this.
[437:54.27]Look at all this.
[437:55.05]This is a hard mode.

[440:03.73]Oh my god!

[444:24.61]I didn't take any damage.
[444:26.41]Oh, thank goodness.

[445:19.18]I bet you it's a staff room.
[445:22.93]Looks like it.
[445:25.35]Hello.
[445:30.19]Goodbye.
[445:42.88]This level is fucking wacky.
[445:44.92]That was actually freaking wacky.
[445:51.83]Alright, so what's down here?
[445:59.69]Player of the adversary.
[446:01.19]You carry one relic that can be remade.
[446:03.20]This is it.
[446:06.14]Boys and girls.
[446:08.54]This is it.
[446:10.44]This is it.
[446:41.00]Interesting.
[446:43.61]Interesting.
[446:48.23]Very pretty.
[446:48.65]I don't know what you did, but... Gosh.
[446:58.18]That was almost one hit.
[447:03.54]I just got saved again by the 1%.
[447:11.17]Dude, oh my god, these... These guys hit so hard.
[447:15.80]Hey, what did you download?
[448:01.58]Jesus.
[448:02.68]Jesus.
[448:03.80]Jesus.
[448:14.51]Get stuck there and don't come down.
[448:19.73]Starlight, star bright, first RSC, I wish the SCORN.
[448:38.87]We're not sleeping tonight, are we?
[448:41.25]Well, I mean, ooh, it is 1.
[448:43.73]Oh my god, I forgot about my lasagna.
[448:51.61]Oh shit.
[448:58.07]Bro, the lasagna.
[448:59.85]The lasagna.
[449:04.79]What is in there?
[449:13.00]What are they dipping in there?
[449:14.38]What are they dunking in there?
[449:20.72]Dude, they're dunking somebody in there.
[449:22.20]America runs.
[449:37.93]I'm dunking.
[449:43.79]Dunkin' fucking donuts.
[449:46.97]Oh, hey, what's going on?
[449:48.59]You like Dunkin'?
[449:49.27]Yeah, of course I do.
[450:05.23]I think I want the shield for this.
[450:08.57]What do you think you're doing?
[450:22.12]Oh my goodness.
[450:23.72]Dude.
[450:24.68]Why?
[450:25.78]What is happening with this level?
[450:32.36]I'm so glad I have Luigi mode on.
[450:34.53]40 luck means I don't die half the time.
[450:36.31]That's more than 1%.
[450:37.75]Without a doubt.
[450:38.07]That's like 30 or 40%.
[450:38.55]I die without that.
[450:46.69]Look at how much shit I keep refilling these because of the luck.
[450:49.85]Luck after 40?
[450:52.21]Luck really does work very well.
[450:59.00]Look at that.
[450:59.32]I didn't even get hurt.
[451:01.13]It's awesome.
[451:19.14]Come on.
[451:19.36]Refill it.
[451:20.24]Refill it.
[451:21.42]Refill it.
[451:44.13]No bullshit, right?
[451:58.76]Oh my god, it's a spear, not just a staff.
[452:02.98]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[452:03.90]I'm gonna die.
[452:05.62]I'm gonna die.
[452:08.42]And that one was longer.
[452:13.47]That one was longer.
[452:15.23]It's varied.
[452:16.43]I have to run.

[453:06.88]I should have killed you months ago, dude.
[453:09.60]I should have killed you months ago when I had a chance.
[453:11.22]Oh, shit.
[453:14.98]Okay, hold on.
[453:15.86]Are they still following me?
[453:44.41]Oh, yup.

[454:07.93]And I'm right behind you.
[454:09.19]Gonna have to give you a quick little smack.
[454:17.65]I want that shield.

[454:48.89]Nice.
[454:51.09]That's not nice.
[454:51.81]I would let you live, but that's not going to happen.
[455:10.41]Nice.
[455:27.21]eight decks ten it's a it's a spell weapon yeah I gave this to you don't ever forget who gave that to you what about this thing forgotten simple of mercutio's favor ravaged by pixelization
[455:55.12]Some relics are too far gone to be restored.
[455:57.20]Temptation quest ends.
[456:04.03]Interesting.
[456:04.61]Okay.
[456:10.11]Well.
[456:13.43]That's unfortunate.
[456:16.66]I really like that guy.
[456:26.72]There's one something meaningful about this item.
[456:28.80]A legacy that can live on in you.
[456:31.36]Returning this to Nostalgaia through her beacons will increase the use of your heroic icon.
[456:38.00]Well, I probably missed, what, two?
[456:51.34]Cool.
[456:52.24]45 is keep memory on death.
[456:53.64]I wonder if I got... I probably won't get there.
[456:57.88]Alright.
[456:58.78]What is through here?
[457:01.78]This has got to be the final arc of the game.
[457:17.13]Hold up.
[457:17.71]Okay.
[457:19.15]The whole thing's coming down.
[457:26.90]He said that three arcs ago.
[457:28.00]I don't know.
[457:38.32]Why are you questioning me?
[457:54.32]If I had 40 or 50 decks, these would hit for a lot more.
[458:02.32]Got them all back too.
[458:02.92]Didn't want to lose the lock on.
[458:32.06]So the final boss is absolutely Super Mario, right?
[458:35.32]In quotes.
[458:37.64]There's no way this is not Mario behind the big door.
[458:40.25]There's no way.
[458:42.41]The shield, the area... What happened?
[458:50.33]Oh, no, no.
[458:54.72]Poor Bowser, yeah.
[459:06.91]Refill it.
[459:07.33]Dammit.

[460:18.21]that do?
[460:21.79]Momentum increase?
[460:26.07]You're making it easier to stagger enemies.
[460:27.99]I wonder if that's probably something I should do.
[460:33.89]Hmm.
[460:41.84]What is that for?
[461:02.88]I don't know.
[461:12.85]I'm very confused.
[461:19.27]What about your lasagna?
[461:21.73]There's definitely 15 minutes left in this game.
[461:25.09]I'm at the very core of the Earth.
[461:33.55]See?
[461:35.49]It doesn't shake like that unless you're in the deep end of the crust.
[462:47.45]This shit was already open.
[462:56.99]Weird.
[463:03.29]An umbrella?
[463:03.89]Can I climb that?
[463:13.00]I can't climb this?
[463:18.85]What's the purpose of this?
[463:31.48]It's got to be worth at least a couple gold.
[463:36.26]Can I go flat out here?
[463:41.81]No, I don't think so.
[463:44.41]Doesn't look like it.

[468:19.89]Yep.
[468:37.22]Hell yeah.
[468:40.50]Okay.
[468:49.00]Very, very nice.
[468:49.90]I'm going to have an opportunity.

[468:52.14]14,000.
[468:52.16]Jesus.
[468:56.77]Jeez.
[468:57.01]Jeez.
[469:07.06]I'm also going to put all the healing on my bar.
[469:11.32]And I think speaking of healing, I think I'm going to put... No, let's just commit to it.
[469:20.31]43.
[469:20.37]Tether here.
[469:23.53]Okay.
[469:30.35]Put all the heals on the bar.

[469:38.72]Yeah, I mean, why not?
[469:39.96]Fully restore stamina.
[469:41.26]I mean, who cares?
[469:42.28]Put it all on.
[469:44.98]Alright.
[469:49.30]This is the final mission.
[469:51.10]The final encounter.
[469:52.08]I hope everybody is prepared.
[469:55.44]Did I tether?
[469:59.94]Yep, I did.
[470:03.56]I think I did, right?
[470:04.70]I did, didn't I?
[470:07.92]Wait, hold on.
[470:08.64]Let me stretch.
[470:10.58]Have I not... No, I took a break, didn't I?
[470:13.36]Have I not left this chair?
[470:20.32]No way.
[470:24.58]Alright.
[470:25.68]It's time for a stretch break.
[470:27.02]I'll be right back.
[470:29.94]Give me two seconds.
[472:40.42]Alright.
[472:41.20]Okay.
[472:41.58]Stretched a bit.
[472:43.95]Went to the bathroom.
[472:45.07]Did some squats.
[472:48.45]Got a drink.
[472:50.53]Let's finish this up.
[473:00.13]And I really gotta beat this in the next 30 minutes.
[473:03.91]Because that's when the edibles gonna kick in.
[473:05.55]So I better hurry the freak up.
[473:15.58]I'm kidding.
[473:17.04]It's 1.30 in the morning.
[473:30.45]Okay.
[473:33.99]Let's go.
[473:58.11]And who might you be?
[474:02.35]It is I. Jock Geek of the Thong Kingdom.
[474:10.55]No, you know what?
[474:11.73]You can just call me Jock.
[474:18.72]You can call me fucking Jockstrap.
[474:34.96]What is this little shimmy?
[474:36.40]Oh my goodness, dude.
[474:45.81]Okay.
[474:47.41]Well, this is going to be fairly difficult.
[474:54.53]Jockstrap didn't quite make it.
[475:03.46]Do I have to shimmy every single time here?
[475:05.68]I can't just open the door.
[475:28.44]Alright.
[475:28.68]Strategy is just dodge.
[475:32.40]Is it?
[476:04.82]One, two, and it's a spin.
[476:19.95]What the?
[476:23.30]Ah!
[476:34.29]Dude, this guy, wait, you're... Holy shit, man, you're annoying.
[476:38.85]Just turn and run, turn and run, turn and run.
[476:52.54]Come on.
[477:03.59]But he's small!
[477:04.71]He's small!
[477:05.87]Get him when he's small!
[477:07.11]Get him when he's small!
[477:26.38]Where?
[477:27.68]What?
[477:32.05]What, just excuse me?
[477:36.45]Full health again.
[477:37.27]Dude.
[477:55.09]What?
[478:05.63]He jumped on the throne.
[478:12.67]Do I have a very important question.
[478:17.95]We're going to see my, there we go.
[478:25.57]What is it called?
[478:29.84]Fragment of tradition.
[478:34.00]I think I can get something to max level now.
[478:36.94]Right?
[478:38.01]Piece of tradition.
[478:38.75]There it is.
[478:41.91]If I keep having trouble here, I'm probably going to have to upgrade the weapons.
[478:56.66]Something tells me when you get them down to really small, maybe I can do something.
[479:08.53]The loot too, yeah.
[479:10.55]We'll see.
[479:17.00]I wonder if there's any strategy.
[479:18.40]I don't know.
[479:22.22]Maybe parries.
[479:23.38]I feel like let me let's you know what?
[479:26.48]I'm going to try.
[479:28.70]Let's try parries.
[479:38.34]Get that shit out of here.
[479:41.82]It's an annoying move.
[479:47.66]He's so slow.
[479:48.36]It's going to be so hard to parry.
[479:49.34]I can't even get up.
[479:58.26]I couldn't even move.
[480:03.24]He switches back and forth from unbelievably slow to unbelievably fast.
[480:07.19]He's one of those dumb bosses.
[480:30.82]You can't just... Why can't I not open this?
[480:35.34]Why?
[480:36.74]Why can't I open that?
[480:37.48]Oh, parry's not going to work.
[480:54.81]Parry's not going to cut it.
[481:05.11]There's got to be a catch to when you get him small.
[481:13.78]Turtle with the shield.
[481:16.38]I'll try it one more time.
[481:17.38]Oh my goodness.
[481:27.93]Where is the attack?
[481:28.81]Where is the attack opportunity on this asshole?
[481:31.27]Like the guy just like what?
[481:34.37]Even if I got in there, I wouldn't have time to swing one time.
[481:42.55]Even if I got in there, he's already doing another move.
[481:45.15]And you just get hit.
[481:48.17]For me to go like this, I'm in!
[481:49.69]He's already swinging again.
[481:53.76]Alright, I'm gonna go upgrade.
[481:57.36]Here's the great question.
[481:59.44]I am so far... I don't think I can.
[482:11.93]Maybe through the staff room?
[482:16.18]Huh.
[482:17.52]I could probably do the staff room, but I... Honestly, I was running through this so fast.
[482:22.52]Because this last area has been... Just chaos.
[482:28.95]Just carnage at every corner.
[482:36.90]That whole last 40 minutes was a blur.
[482:38.71]I don't even remember how I got in here.
[482:41.67]I remember just sprinting through because it was just a fucking mess.
[482:59.80]Come on.
[483:00.32]I can't even see myself on the screen.
[483:37.95]Alright, let's go Mario Jesus dude, what the fuck?
[483:55.50]What are you doing?
[484:00.67]Oh my god, stop swinging the fucking weapon for one second!
[484:20.19]Get him small, then it's free.
[484:23.13]This asshole was jumping around everywhere.
[484:32.14]Just be patient.
[484:35.46]The attack opportunities seem like zero.
[484:39.17]For as long as me to go like this, he's already doing something else.
[484:45.75]The fuck?
[485:03.76]Underleveled?
[485:04.44]No way.
[485:04.94]63?
[485:05.06]What should I be?
[485:06.84]80?
[485:06.86]100?
[485:06.88]3.
[485:06.90]Okay.
[485:10.50]Nope. 1...
[485:27.48]Two.
[485:29.78]One.
[485:30.82]Two.
[485:31.25]One.
[485:33.85]Two.
[485:34.37]Three.
[485:40.21]Flip.
[485:47.81]Flip.
[485:51.29]Flip.
[485:52.87]Yep.
[485:54.88]Get me out of that.
[485:55.70]Come on, man.
[485:56.44]That's not cool.
[485:58.47]It takes so long to get up.
[485:59.75]It takes so long to get up.
[486:41.61]No, I didn't want to press that.
[486:43.37]God damn it.
[486:44.13]Happened to fucking go... I pressed X accidentally.
[486:48.19]You little shit.
[487:07.38]No, it's... Get over here.
[487:27.48]No mushroom there for you now, is there?
[487:30.73]Dickhead.
[488:21.72]Come here, you little shit!
[488:31.68]Die!
[488:34.39]Where am I?
[488:40.05]Oh shit, in my fucking pants!
[488:42.88]He's going up again.
[489:03.22]Uh-oh.
[489:04.32]What does that mean?
[489:05.20]What does that mean?
[489:06.16]What does that mean?
[489:07.07]What does that mean?
[489:42.37]Where did you just go?
[489:43.31]Dude.
[489:43.41]I didn't mean to do that.
[489:50.72]I'm an idiot.
[489:54.20]Die!
[490:00.45]Get out of my life, Mario!
[490:14.58]Oh, yes.
[490:18.75]I like the BatChest.
[490:23.21]BatChest.
[490:24.35]Get out of my life, Mario.
[490:26.19]Oh, he said it.
[490:26.93]Let me see what that is.
[490:40.13]It wants me to do this so bad.
[490:41.41]I might as well.
[490:44.79]That was hard.
[490:47.75]Alright, so that... That was pretty cool.
[490:50.98]That was very difficult.
[490:52.00]That was tricky.
[490:53.36]Here's the pipe.
[490:55.36]30 strength.
[491:01.28]Oh, take that, Mario!
[491:02.74]I was trying to think of something really cool to say at the last hit.
[491:07.85]It's like 2 in the morning, man.
[491:09.39]Give me a little bit of slack.
[491:21.99]I'm just a lance.
[491:24.00]Cool.
[491:25.08]Alright.
[491:26.32]Let's, uh, let's see the end.
[491:27.48]What do I have to do?
[491:32.00]Take the throne!
[491:32.84]Okay.
[491:41.45]The adversary's empty throne sits before you, the epicenter of Nostalgia's conflict.
[491:47.18]You have liberated and restored so much.
[491:49.30]Perhaps if you claim this authority for yourself, you could be the one to fix all of Nostalgia's problems.
[491:56.95]Here's the thing.
[492:05.87]Not quite.
[492:24.96]Might as well just keep it going.
[492:27.36]The luck helps so much.
[492:54.76]Alright, so that was probably bad end.
[492:56.24]Or maybe one of the... I imagine there's probably two or three endings, but... Here we go.
[493:04.00]Is this good end, you think?
[493:04.96]Let's find out.
[493:06.58]Memory flows freely into Nostalgia's open heart.
[493:09.12]She is ready to receive you.
[493:10.64]When you are ready to complete your heroic journey, give your memory back to the world.
[493:13.96]Alright, so I either give all my memories back, or I just take the throne.
[493:20.10]I'm curious.
[493:20.50]Let's see what happens.
[493:22.54]Warning, this will end the game.
[493:26.89]I cut the cord, yeah.
[493:32.74]You want to do a poll?
[493:33.32]What do you guys think?
[493:36.68]Should we poll it up?
[493:37.82]I mean, you guys stuck around for this long.
[493:39.04]I feel like you should have a say.
[493:39.84]Let's go for it.
[493:45.47]Take the throne or restore the memory.
[493:51.05]And by the way, I can veto either one.
[493:54.20]So... Nah, I want to do this.
[493:56.96]Never mind.
[493:58.80]I'm doing this.
[494:00.08]Never mind.
[494:00.98]Game over.
[494:03.22]Sorry, everybody.
[494:13.11]Okay.
[494:15.13]Oh.
[494:15.61]Well, it was 82% anyways.
[494:16.09]Jesus!
[494:22.61]No!
[494:23.47]Oh my god!
[494:24.41]It's gonna be another thing at the end, right?
[494:40.06]Oh my god, I'm so sorry!
[494:54.67]Post credits?
[494:55.49]Let's find out.
[495:02.06]I have my game volume turned pretty far down too.
[495:05.08]Alright.
[495:10.20]Are you ready for the review?
[495:11.12]Are you ready for the review?
[495:13.25]That last area was a mess.
[495:24.35]But.
[495:28.76]There's a lot of really cool shit in this game.
[495:30.42]I feel like you can play through it a couple times with different types of classes.
[495:34.79]I love the memory thing.
[495:35.97]That's a really nice twist on upgrading weapons.
[495:40.53]Super cool.
[495:41.53]Game was actually pretty phenomenal, I would say.
[495:46.67]I'm going to be weird here.
[495:49.07]I'm going to be weird here.
[495:50.56]I don't think a lot of people are expecting this.
[495:55.62]This is a...
[496:07.51]This is a... This is an 8.7.
[496:21.22]There it is.
[496:22.20]8.7.
[496:22.28]Yeah, that was great.
[496:32.98]That was very, very, very fun.
[496:35.42]I would say that was great.
[496:39.33]I think this is not a 7.
[496:45.27]If you take away the memory aspect of this game, I think that's bumping it up a whole letter grade for me.
[496:58.83]That system is really unique and deserves praise.
[497:01.37]8.7.
[497:03.81]That was great.
[497:08.10]Was it better than Eternal Cylinder?
[497:10.04]I mean, I give Eternal Cylinder like a 6.7 or like a 7 or something like that.
[497:22.51]7.5?
[497:22.59]Yeah.
[497:27.84]I think this game was way more than I ever expected.
[497:34.20]I really, really enjoyed it.
[497:41.50]Somebody said this earlier.
[497:43.52]I've played, I've, how many times have you seen me attempt to play as soulslike in quotes?
[497:50.56]And I kind of just like, yeah, that was like kind of fun for three, four hours, but I'll move on.
[497:55.08]That happens a lot.
[497:58.24]I've, I know I have loaded up on this stream and off stream too.
[498:02.90]At least a half dozen soulslikes.
[498:05.59]And I just kind of give up in the first like four or five hours.
[498:09.56]I did not do that with this.
[498:10.46]This kept my attention the whole time.
[498:13.60]It's got that crazy, every single thing is connected Dark Souls 1.
[498:17.14]For all of you Dark Souls 1 brains out there, I'd say you probably would like that.
[498:27.21]I thought it was very, very good.
[498:28.65]I thought it was great.
[498:30.13]And to me, somewhere in the 8s is great.
[498:33.34]Not quite in 9.
[498:35.14]I think 9 implies it's, like, incredible.
[498:38.97]I think that was great.
[498:39.73]And there's a lot that I didn't see.
[498:46.44]There's probably a couple areas I probably just kind of ran through, skipped over.
[498:48.78]That last area was a little messy, but all in all, can't complain.
[498:53.04]All in all, the game's an 8.7.
[498:55.92]Not like me reviewing anything matters.
[498:59.24]Me giving a score doesn't really mean very much, but it was great.
[499:06.41]Alright, everybody.
[499:17.81]What about the blunt rotation?
[499:22.01]Oh, shit.
[499:22.59]Okay.
[499:30.74]Uh... Pink eye's not coming anywhere near, like, where I live.
[499:35.72]I just want to make that really clear.
[499:40.05]Um... Probably the lasagna that I didn't eat.
[499:47.75]The guy that betrayed us in the end.
[499:57.93]And the old guy.
[500:06.93]also the game's like an eight high kind of mid to high eight for me just because I actually might play it again off stream just like in my own time and play like a sorcery that's how I can tell that like alright alright so that should be a couple of notches higher it's got multiplayer too doesn't that actually though
[500:37.44]Well done.
[500:38.84]Collapsed in the chat for the developers.
[500:40.68]I don't know.
[500:42.64]How much is this game?
[500:46.78]Seems like it's got a lot of secrets.
[500:47.88]How much does this cost?
[501:00.19]Here's 25 bucks.
[501:03.25]25 bucks.
[501:05.63]It's got a demo too.
[501:08.35]That's fair as hell.
[501:10.33]Fair as hell.
[501:14.19]Nice job.
[501:15.19]That game was great.
[501:16.43]I will see you guys in a few days.
[501:21.79]Probably be live on Wednesday.
[501:22.99]I think we did three days in a row here.
[501:28.49]Probably take two days here.
[501:33.50]I don't know if I'm... I really like doing these
[501:39.45]I say this every single stream.
[501:40.74]I feel like at the end of the late night streams, but they hit so different that I just... It's probably staying.
[501:50.04]Have a great night.
[501:51.54]Get some sleep.
[501:53.00]See you later.
[501:53.48]Take care of yourselves.
[502:06.16]It's kind of a clean slate as of this coming week.
[502:11.88]Don't really have anything planned so we can maybe fill in some stuff.
[502:25.77]It's been a wonderful night.
[502:26.63]Yeah.
[502:30.65]It's been great.
[502:32.75]Hope you had a good time.
[502:35.02]What about sorcery?
[502:35.86]Please, please.
[502:38.98]I'll probably pick... What's going to have to happen is I'm going to have to catch myself back up with what happened in sorcery.
[502:46.50]We might have to do a little recap stream.
[502:50.54]Where we have to kind of remember what happened.
[502:52.94]And go from there.
[502:53.44]Because I was sort of a third of the way through the third episode.
[503:04.55]I enjoyed my stay, and then you drew a dick.
[503:10.71]Alright, I'll let it slide.
[503:19.39]It got removed.
[503:20.77]Hey, as the mods have famously said, I would be banned from my own stream, and I would be banned from my own Discord.
[503:35.46]And... We gotta have... We have to have order, though.
[503:39.64]You know what I mean?
[503:40.76]There has to be order.
[503:45.88]Right?
[503:47.12]Otherwise, it just devolves into just chaos.
[503:50.75]We have to have order.
[504:01.11]Alright.
[504:03.02]Good morning.
[504:05.96]Good night.
[504:06.92]Whichever one will do it for you now.
[504:15.46]Have a beautiful night.
[504:16.08]See you soon.
[504:21.92]I'm calling you mother for God's sake.
[504:47.05]I'm not quite gone yet.
[505:05.59]I just wanted to address something in chat.
[505:07.55]It was pretty funny.
[505:08.17]Somebody said, I keep calling my mother and she keeps asking about sorcery and I don't know what to tell her.
[505:19.28]Uh, just tell her to wait a little bit longer.
[505:21.83]Alright, see you Wednesday.
[505:23.93]Take it easy.
