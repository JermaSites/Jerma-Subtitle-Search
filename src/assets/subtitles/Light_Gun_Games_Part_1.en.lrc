[ve:60.16.100]

[00:46.22]I probably sound a little different today because my whole entire downstairs studio, that's right, it's a studio.
[00:56.42]I get shit for that.
[01:01.06]My whole room's been rearranged to bring in a fucking huge, like 40 inch, 500 fucking pounds CRT TV.
[01:16.03]And you know what?
[01:17.67]Earlier today, it was working just fine.
[01:21.13]This is gonna be like a just sit here and talk shit while you look at scan lines.
[01:31.27]Give me a second.
[01:32.05]I'll show you.
[01:32.73]Look, I had this grand scheme idea.
[01:35.09]And the idea was gonna be alright.
[01:38.28]It was gonna be cool.
[01:40.88]It was gonna be fun.
[01:41.68]And you'll see what the problem is.
[01:45.44]Got some fucking detectives in the chat.
[01:46.98]We'll figure this out.
[01:53.35]So, here we go.
[01:56.11]Let's just get out.
[01:56.89]You're going to see my ass.
[01:58.71]So, like, get ready for my ass in camp.
[02:01.97]Hold on.
[02:03.69]What do we got here?
[02:05.91]Hi.
[02:07.36]Hey.
[02:09.32]Thanks for the bits.
[02:11.40]So, here's the issue we have here.
[02:14.06]Uh, it was gonna be, look, it was gonna be so cool.
[02:16.58]You guys have no idea.
[02:17.62]Look, just watch.
[02:19.74]I was ready, I have this, and it was gonna be like this.
[02:22.64]You know what I mean?
[02:26.88]Like, and you guys can't even see that.
[02:30.74]And it could, here, watch what happens when I do this.
[02:34.78]To make it so you can actually see what's going on.
[02:36.50]Like, already bring down, like, that's on me.
[02:41.46]I don't want it on me, you fucking idiot.
[02:46.05]What just happened?
[02:48.03]Like, can you guys even see?
[02:49.42]Yeah, okay, you can see it now.
[02:51.78]So watch what happened.
[02:52.76]Every few seconds, you see how that just like, it's like the screen is water.
[02:58.34]The screen's like underwater.
[03:04.29]Because, alright, here's what happened.
[03:07.13]Pulling in, there's the PlayStation 1 is down there.
[03:10.27]That, like, takes a little stress out, though.
[03:13.79]Like...
[03:14.98]PlayStation 1, get the fuck out of it.
[03:16.40]Anyways, so PlayStation 1's down there.
[03:19.92]It connects to the TV.
[03:21.46]I was gonna pull in the video from this TV, but the problem with that is if I do that, take a look what happens when I pull the trigger every single fucking time.
[03:33.83]Oh, let me like shoot a guy out of that.
[03:37.07]Like that's gonna flash in your face and it's gonna drive people crazy.
[03:40.47]It gave me a headache just by, I was sitting real close to the screen like I used to do when I was 10.
[03:46.44]Anyways, how's that for audio?
[03:52.58]Am I delayed here?
[03:53.60]What's going on?
[03:58.31]Get the TV in this room.
[03:59.73]I'm going to stand next to the TV so you can see just how fucking big this thing is.
[04:04.45]Wait a second.
[04:06.30]Looks are deceiving here.
[04:08.96]This is a big fucking TV.
[04:12.63]I could, like, lie across this TV.
[04:14.33]This is like a 40-inch CRT TV.
[04:17.48]It's big, it's clunky, and it's annoying.
[04:22.08]This thing, we dropped it on the ground.
[04:24.16]I dropped this fucking TV on the ground.
[04:26.70]We were bringing it down the stairs, and it, like, go, go, go, like, straight into the ground here.
[04:31.26]Maybe that's why it's fucked up.
[04:34.69]Anyways, though, let me, like, calibrate the gun.
[04:38.43]Might as well just, like, I'm gonna, like, drink a shitload.
[04:42.39]So let's get that calibrated.
[04:47.86]Yeah, that's good.
[04:50.14]Let me get one more like that.
[04:53.50]Is that alright?
[04:54.02]That's okay.
[04:58.08]So like, this is not ideal, obviously.
[05:02.57]I'll turn it up, don't worry.
[05:05.03]You have no idea how long I was trying to fucking figure this shit out.
[05:09.09]This has been an all day affair.
[05:13.33]You know what I mean?
[05:14.23]I've been having an affair all day.
[05:18.25]Let me just, like, tweet that we're playing, like, shitty light gun.
[05:22.27]Somebody just call me thick.
[05:27.32]We'll live.
[05:28.26]No, but just wait till we get in the game.
[05:29.70]Look, I'm a perfectionist, okay?
[05:31.42]When I make a project, it better be the best that you could ever imagine.
[05:36.56]Otherwise, I don't want to do it at all.
[05:38.58]You understand?
[05:39.61]You understand?
[05:46.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:46.60]Why is this playing?
[05:48.63]Has my stream been playing the whole fucking time?
[05:51.75]Wait, don't... Alright.
[06:00.47]The TV size joke was worth it.
[06:02.39]It's a fucking huge TV.
[06:04.79]Look, I don't even know if... You guys want me to turn this up?
[06:07.74]I'm not sure I want to turn it up this loud.
[06:09.34]People are going to think there's a fucking violence in here.
[06:14.75]You know what I mean?
[06:15.17]What if I'm gonna be like, oh yeah, that's fun!
[06:19.38]My neighbors are gonna think I'm murdering somebody.
[06:21.38]I'm gonna turn this down.
[06:29.83]Louder on the mic, I can't.
[06:31.21]I don't want anyone to think there's a violence going on in here, you know what I mean?
[06:39.61]Okay, let me make a tweet, hold on.
[06:44.02]ass thing I swear to God it wasn't even doing this shit you know what I mean alright and this thing's done this thing I didn't even get the right one let's talk about this for a second hold on let me let me tweet something just wait just everybody calm down I can make a tweet my phone just died
[07:12.25]I can't tweet now.
[07:14.05]Oh my god, just hold on a minute.
[07:15.82]I'm starting soon.
[08:42.38]Alright, hold on.
[08:43.10]Wait for that to charge.
[08:46.57]Wait for my telephone to charge.
[08:50.79]Where'd I go?
[08:52.39]Oh, there I am.
[08:54.87]I just spilled orange juice all over.
[08:57.36]What a joke.
[08:59.78]Do you know how big that fucking TV is?
[09:03.76]And by the way, I feel like if I want to look at chat... Oh god, I'm going to knock this over.
[09:07.81]I know it.
[09:11.73]I have to go, like, to look at chat, I have to go like this.
[09:15.63]Hey, what are you guys saying?
[09:17.57]My voice, like, my voice is not going to be quiet because I'm going to be standing here.
[09:20.51]This is going to be, like, my area right here.
[09:24.84]What did I do to the camera?
[09:25.72]Alright, do I have enough battery?
[09:30.18]No.
[09:30.62]Why am I holding my phone?
[09:32.38]It's been a long day.
[09:34.20]So we'll tweet in a minute.
[09:36.08]Let's calibrate the gun.
[09:39.74]Okay, right here.
[09:42.53]Is the light gun aligned correctly?
[09:45.29]I believe it is.
[09:47.31]That's a technique if you don't know how to do that.
[09:49.97]Because then it was like, my theory was, why are we, what happened to the camera?
[10:00.04]What the fuck?
[10:04.24]Yeah, that's an umbrella just in case I get fucking chilly.
[10:07.97]How's that?
[10:08.27]Is that better?
[10:08.91]That's better.
[10:10.11]See what I mean?
[10:10.53]See how, like, I'm pointing at the TV?
[10:12.93]Like, that's much cooler.
[10:13.87]Alright.
[10:15.57]There we go.
[10:19.08]That looks good.
[10:19.80]That looks aligned.
[10:24.36]And what's going on with the frame rate here?
[10:29.46]Fucking highest FPS.
[10:30.94]Give me a fucking break.
[10:37.75]Alright.
[10:39.74]Here we go.
[10:41.42]Let's play Time Crisis until you guys get sick of how awful it looks on the TV.
[10:48.66]Don't worry, I'll make a few jokes.
[10:50.60]Here we go.
[10:51.00]Let's turn it up.
[10:55.15]I'm okay with the volume being loud here.
[10:58.21]What the hell is it?
[10:58.83]No, you guys, there we go.
[11:01.45]There's been a kidnapping.
[11:03.03]It's Rachel, the daughter of the president of Sertia.
[11:06.19]Look at this fucking quality.
[11:11.17]Hey, how many times?
[11:13.45]I have to like talk over this.
[11:16.83]So as I was setting this up, interestingly enough, you know when you're at the arcade and this machine was there and this intro played over and over and over and over and over again?
[11:30.32]This was playing like this loud the entire time I was having problems trying to set the TV up.
[11:36.65]So I was like stuck in a fucking arcade back in the 90s in front of a time crisis machine.
[11:44.77]Point at an actual television.
[11:49.02]Alright, let's get it going.
[11:49.82]There we go, that's better.
[11:59.08]I told you this was going to be not fucking good.
[12:01.54]I told you guys.
[12:03.18]I tried to warn you.
[12:04.87]This has been a disaster trying to get this to work.
[12:08.01]Just pretend like it's YouTube in fucking 2006.
[12:10.31]Alright, I'm ready.
[12:12.81]Arcade special.
[12:13.71]We're going to do arcade.
[12:17.09]Should I make it bigger?
[12:17.73]How does that look?
[12:21.51]Hold on, let me make it a little bigger so it's not so shitty looking.
[12:26.79]It's like an IRL stream.
[12:27.63]You know what I mean?
[12:28.61]Like, I'm here.
[12:29.27]I'm going to do story game.
[12:35.08]No, I need to be louder?
[12:36.34]Hold on.
[12:38.26]Let me just make sure it works.
[12:41.66]This nation will soon be mine.
[12:46.65]That takes a little low now.
[12:49.53]Hold on.
[12:49.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[12:50.67]That doesn't look right.
[12:52.17]Your father will take a price for destroying the imperial rule.
[12:58.13]That's not what it looks like on my screen.
[13:07.10]I think I have overscan problems too.
[13:08.72]Alright, here we go.
[13:11.28]I'm actually really good at light gun games.
[13:12.90]I'll prove it here in a second.
[13:15.52]Watch this.
[13:15.90]I don't have a pedal.
[13:16.44]I don't have a pedal.
[13:17.09]I don't have a pedal.
[13:19.47]How do you use it?
[13:20.19]Oh, I gotta hold the button.
[13:23.11]Okay.
[13:26.83]I'm pretty good at light gun games.
[13:28.22]Why am I looking behind me?
[13:33.36]Got that guy in the back.
[13:34.72]That brings me back to the fucking old arcades back in the 60s.
[13:46.23]I'm telling you, I'm actually pretty good.
[13:52.36]I wasn't making that up.
[14:02.58]I don't like that.
[14:03.06]I want the pedal.
[14:06.74]I'm going to be at 60 seconds this whole time.
[14:08.54]Wait, why is everybody laughing?
[14:11.23]Why is everybody laughing at me?
[14:19.49]I move till I move with the game.
[14:20.97]I swear to God.
[14:31.33]I don't like how I have to look behind.
[14:32.98]Sorry, sometimes you lose a life at the very end.
[14:35.16]I gotta, blah, blah, blah.
[14:40.18]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[14:47.04]But this is like, this is kind of blown out here.
[14:51.46]Can I not like change this?
[14:53.88]I gotta like change the white balance on this camera.
[15:07.05]I swear to god I'm not this weird in real life.
[15:09.95]I swear to god.
[15:12.95]I might have to recalibrate.
[15:23.46]This is actually really- I'm glad I got the real thing.
[15:28.66]I gotta- I gotta pay- That was bullshit.
[15:36.88]How many lives do I have?
[15:38.38]One more?
[15:38.92]We're good.
[15:40.74]I'm fine.
[15:41.20]51% rating.
[15:42.48]It's a light.
[15:44.32]Hold on.
[15:45.20]It's a light.
[15:47.88]Let me turn the lights off.
[16:06.29]How do I pause the game?
[16:08.93]Hold on.
[16:09.50]How do I pause the game?
[16:11.16]I can't pause the game.
[16:11.96]There we go.
[16:12.28]Alright.
[16:13.42]Hold on.
[16:13.66]Let me do something real quick.
[16:16.08]Let me make a tweet.
[16:22.70]51%.
[16:22.72]That's pretty good.
[16:23.48]Come on.
[16:24.76]Alright.
[16:25.14]Hold on.
[16:26.14]I need to change the lights in here.
[16:27.76]Maybe that'll help.
[16:32.14]How many tickets did I get?
[16:37.04]Yeah, that's right.
[16:37.88]These games never gave tickets.
[16:42.61]How's that?
[16:43.17]Is that like a little cooler looking?
[16:45.43]Where it's focusing on the screen?
[16:47.17]It needs to be louder.
[16:56.84]That's like nice and dark, right?
[17:00.62]Too dark?
[17:04.00]Well, that made it worse.
[17:11.62]Red equals violence.
[17:19.58]Now it's too bright.
[17:20.38]Oh, let me do this.
[17:21.40]Now it's too blue.
[17:27.60]That's alright.
[17:31.07]That's good.
[17:31.83]That's fine.
[17:32.51]Let me tweet.
[17:34.41]I'm going to beat this whole game in one sitting.
[17:38.53]Just watch.
[17:43.17]Turn down the white balance on the TV.
[17:45.71]No, it's like, just trust me when I say I've been trying to make this fucking work for like six hours.
[17:57.74]I'm going to turn the brightness down on the TV.
[17:59.59]That'll probably help.
[18:07.15]Trying to play old light gun games.
[18:13.56]No, not drinking gin.
[18:15.20]That's not what I wanted to say.
[18:16.18]I can't even, like, why can't I not type right now?
[18:27.45]I think I'm just so fucked up from... This last week has been fucking crazy.
[18:34.70]That TV, man.
[18:35.92]I wanted to fucking seriously put my hand through it.
[18:42.56]Now let me see if I can, if I can, oh, Jesus Christ, don't do that.
[18:46.12]Alright, hold on a minute.
[18:48.06]What can I?
[18:51.50]Is this thing not gonna let me do this?
[18:56.92]No, it isn't.
[18:57.64]God damn it, of course not.
[19:05.05]Actually, you might be able to do it through here.
[19:09.35]Let's try this.
[19:19.48]Hey, that looks a little better.
[19:23.63]It's more closely related to what I have here.
[19:33.29]And then I'll go look.
[19:34.49]And by the way, I had to get one of these like universal TV remotes.
[19:39.53]That was such a pain in the ass.
[19:41.13]Alright, what do we got?
[19:42.39]Like fucking color?
[19:44.05]Brightness?
[19:48.52]Move the tint down too a little bit.
[19:54.35]Maximum purple light.
[19:58.05]I think I might just pull in like the actual raw footage and just like paste it into the TV tomorrow.
[20:03.57]I really think that's what I'm going to do.
[20:05.55]That seems like more of a better idea.
[20:07.55]More of a better idea.
[20:09.19]More better.
[20:09.65]Let's see.
[20:12.79]Color.
[20:13.43]The color needs to be dropped a little bit.
[20:26.89]What's with the fucking focus here?
[20:33.39]I'm gonna paste gameplay footage into the TV.
[20:38.54]I swear to God, that's happening.
[20:41.52]Alright, am I ready for this?
[20:42.32]Somebody gave $100, wait a minute.
[20:46.44]Polo Juice gave 100 bucks.
[20:56.05]Check the GunCon connection and point the gun at the screen.
[21:00.21]I'm going for it.
[21:01.41]Thank you, Polo, for the $100.
[21:02.49]I'm sorry, I've been all fucked up.
[21:05.48]I'm telling you, tomorrow I'm pulling in the footage and then I'm putting it on this fucking TV here in the square.
[21:15.62]See, I would have done that in the first place, but the reason why I didn't is because that white flash could seriously fuck with a bunch of people.
[21:24.84]But thank you so much, Polo.
[21:26.50]I really appreciate it.
[21:29.56]Now, let me like really terribly beat this game on camera.
[21:34.60]No, it's not.
[21:35.48]That's like the correct, whatever.
[21:37.50]I'm trying to turn it up.
[21:38.38]Who gives a shit?
[21:39.13]I'm drinking too.
[21:40.61]This is going to be so loud.
[21:43.51]Don't tell anybody I did this.
[21:49.57]Here's another problem.
[21:50.85]Adjusting the camera exposure.
[21:53.29]If I do that, oh boy, oh boy, you can't even see it.
[21:56.20]It gets terrible.
[22:01.10]Yeah, don't wait.
[22:01.74]Dude, let me just tell you something.
[22:03.74]This is a growing pains with trying to figure this out.
[22:06.68]I have so many light gun games that like, I don't give a fuck.
[22:10.66]We're getting this to work.
[22:12.08]I don't care if I have to spend like a thousand dollars to get it to work.
[22:15.12]I already have like spent that much money on all this shit.
[22:18.24]So we ain't fucking giving up.
[22:19.46]You understand?
[22:21.77]Just tonight is going to be a little shitty.
[22:28.45]Don't tell anybody I did this.
[22:32.16]This stuff sucks, by the way.
[22:43.02]Keep your fucking mouth shut.
[22:46.39]I wasted it.
[22:47.13]You idiot.
[22:52.66]These are the only two I have.
[22:53.92]I don't have any more.
[22:57.75]Hand sanitizer.
[23:00.23]Yeah, I like to drink hand sanitizer.
[23:02.07]Don't tell anybody I did that.
[23:14.01]And it's not good, if you were curious.
[23:19.45]Alright.
[23:23.92]Here we go.
[23:32.21]What, did this get louder?
[23:34.71]Wait, no, I can't, wait.
[23:36.51]The gun sound is different, the gun sound changed.
[23:41.27]Why is the gun a different sound?
[23:43.99]See, I'm not insane, the gun is different.
[24:08.17]Whoa, two guys with hammers.
[24:20.15]God damn it.
[24:23.73]I hate having to hold down the button.
[24:41.22]I'm good.
[24:44.42]We're good.
[24:47.31]I really didn't even like drop the exposure.
[24:57.48]God damn it.
[25:01.18]What's the danger for?
[25:10.98]I got time.
[25:12.34]What am I doing?
[25:18.61]I'm, like, timed to do this.
[25:25.95]I need to, like, drop the exposure even more, I think.
[25:29.65]What if I do this?
[25:33.87]Oh, damn it.
[25:35.11]Oh, no!
[25:40.46]I just, like, shined that in your face.
[25:42.85]Ay-yi-yi.
[25:43.28]Here goes the boss.
[26:14.88]Got him.
[26:24.97]Last second.
[26:29.05]We got Magneto here.
[26:30.57]We shot Magneto's face off.
[26:32.01]I need to turn this way.
[26:33.97]The camera should have been over there.
[26:36.13]So I could talk this way into the mic.
[26:38.19]Instead of having to look this way.
[26:43.60]It goes up life insurance.
[26:44.62]What do you mean life insurance?
[26:48.88]If I type in capitals, the stream will see my message.
[26:51.22]That's true.
[26:52.14]Right.
[26:55.65]These guys look like storm wind guards.
[26:58.77]Oh shit.
[27:14.54]I want to stay at 60 seconds.
[27:20.00]Fuck.
[27:23.31]How long is the original time crisis?
[27:25.33]I don't even remember.
[27:30.79]There we go.
[27:31.97]I get infinity continues, right?
[27:36.55]I think I need to recalibrate the gun.
[27:42.44]Action!
[27:44.40]I can't.
[27:48.59]It's a little off.
[27:49.27]Feels a little off to me.
[27:56.11]Almost got hit.
[27:57.17]Not quite, though.
[28:01.39]Every... I... Fuck it.
[28:03.47]What the fuck?
[28:05.49]Oh!

[28:15.81]Is it in the right spot?
[28:16.83]Is it in the right spot?
[28:19.02]Action.
[28:19.96]Action.
[28:23.02]Alright.
[28:24.38]I'm not looking to walk into a grenade again.
[28:25.84]Action.
[28:29.31]Not again.
[28:37.72]Here we go.
[28:45.88]I fucking missed.
[28:47.44]I don't jump into the grenade.
[28:54.91]Good.
[28:55.51]Bring me up there.
[28:56.09]60 seconds.
[28:56.31]What the fuck?
[28:57.05]Action!
[29:06.45]Come on, give me that one.
[29:08.67]Shit!
[29:09.45]You got this.
[29:10.31]You're great.

[29:11.13]Clear.
[29:11.53]Right, Dunk Moore?
[29:13.39]Wait, are you gonna...
[29:36.66]Is that the other button it's for?
[29:39.11]Damn.
[29:39.39]No, no, no, that's just pause.
[29:40.33]God damn it!
[30:12.80]Come on, come on, show yourself.
[30:14.36]Show yourself on the left side, come on.
[30:22.26]Ooh.

[30:52.09]Come on!
[30:57.65]Come on!
[31:06.85]I need more time.
[31:07.72]I'm not gonna beat the boss like this.
[31:16.28]I'm a cheater.
[31:16.60]Why am I a cheater?
[31:17.24]What are you talking about?
[31:20.04]Why am I a cheater?
[31:22.78]My eyes.
[31:23.50]I'm telling you.
[31:24.00]This is why I didn't want to do it from capture card.
[31:26.74]I'm going to burn you guys' retinas out.
[31:29.13]See?
[31:29.25]It's a different sound.
[31:29.93]He's going to jump in front of me.
[31:46.72]Watch it.
[31:47.86]Watch it.
[31:48.32]Good.
[31:50.28]Damn it!
[31:50.68]Why is it so bright?
[31:53.36]I'm right here.
[32:13.27]Oh shit, that's far away.
[32:14.63]Why is it, it's off!
[32:39.44]I'm getting so angry, but for no reason.
[32:50.22]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[32:51.76]You're blowing it.
[32:57.97]Woo!
[32:59.49]God.
[33:05.58]What the?
[33:08.34]That was not good.
[33:10.82]Oh, you fucking loser.
[33:12.06]Come on, you loser.
[33:19.83]I wish I had some commentary, but I don't.
[33:27.65]Wow, don't hit me.
[33:33.48]Alright.
[33:37.24]There's only like three levels in this whole game.
[33:42.11]I'll beat the whole game, don't worry.
[33:44.73]Who's that?
[33:46.07]Oh.
[33:58.04]Listen, folks.
[33:58.86]Sorry, boys.
[33:59.64]I know.
[34:00.36]How do I?
[34:00.80]Hold on.
[34:01.02]Wait, wait.
[34:01.44]I've got to pause it.
[34:04.96]I'm going to say, like, you will be flashed.
[34:08.47]I remember the knife guy.
[34:09.41]I can't even see you.
[34:14.24]So, you are the fool.
[34:15.88]49%.
[34:15.92]That's good.
[34:16.88]If he's had half the shots I took, I shot him.
[34:19.38]So very far.
[34:20.68]Be my guest and let me entertain you.
[34:23.12]Alright, hold on.
[34:25.26]Let me just pause it.
[34:26.30]I've got plenty of time.
[34:27.30]I think the game crashed.
[34:31.94]Action.
[34:32.84]Okay, hold on.
[34:38.43]Let me put a thing that says you're going to get flashed.
[34:43.51]text doesn't matter what it says there in the morning you will be flashed let's put this like down here looks good right
[35:11.76]Also, I'm going to do this right now because I'm looking at it and it's pissing me off.
[35:17.40]So give me a second.
[35:22.98]I'm looking at it and it's fucking really making me angry.
[35:35.15]Let me change the white balance here.
[35:40.54]This shit is incorrect.
[35:53.29]Dude, this whole thing is fucked up.
[35:54.69]Like, is my... Look at me.
[35:57.80]I'm, like, superimposed in an 80s... I'm just in the 80s.
[36:03.76]That's it.
[36:05.20]Why is this so fucked up right now?
[36:08.04]Hold on.
[36:10.22]Like, it doesn't even know what to do.
[36:11.90]It's purple.
[36:14.36]Why is it purple right now?
[36:25.41]Holy shit.
[36:26.45]This is totally fucked.
[36:33.07]There's too much white now.
[36:34.76]There we go.
[36:37.76]Alright, this looks a little better.
[36:43.83]I don't know why it's fucking purple.
[37:00.99]This is so fucked up.
[37:02.65]Like, I have no idea why it's purple.
[37:06.28]Literally, you could pay me a fucking trillion dollars and I would not be able to tell you why this is.
[37:13.46]Like, look at how fucked up this is.
[37:16.89]There's no rhyme or reason to any of this.
[37:19.13]We're pulling the raw footage next time.
[37:27.29]Look at just even the way that this whole thing looks.
[37:32.23]It's just, this is so fucked.
[37:43.44]It's like The Incredible Hulk, but reversed.
[37:46.55]I think I may have, like, scrambled my webcam's brain.
[37:54.87]I wonder what happens, like, what do I look like in this?
[38:07.37]I don't even know what's going on there.
[38:10.27]We're gonna have to live with it, though.
[38:15.18]We're just going to have to live with it.
[38:18.28]This purple TV.
[38:20.98]Oh my god, why?
[38:22.05]I have an idea.
[38:23.47]I'm going to just refresh the damn thing.
[38:34.49]Morning, you will be flashed.
[38:35.69]Yeah, you're going to be flashed here soon.
[38:37.23]Let's see.
[38:41.76]Okay, okay.
[38:44.38]Now, like, it seems... Okay, now look at what happened here.
[38:48.04]Look at how much better this looks.
[38:51.15]What?
[38:51.35]Like, what?
[38:53.37]This looks a thousand times better.
[39:00.71]Oh, my God.
[39:01.64]What a disaster.
[39:08.64]I didn't do anything.
[39:13.86]Alright.
[39:14.26]Okay.
[39:14.62]Alright.
[39:15.02]I'm liking that.
[39:15.80]Okay.
[39:19.56]Just pretend like you're at your grandmother's house.
[39:21.04]That's what this is.
[39:25.26]That looks better.
[39:26.00]Alright.
[39:26.26]Now I'm going to plug the other one in.
[39:32.15]And then we're going to be good to go.
[39:33.39]Please don't crash.
[39:35.09]If this crashes, I'm going to be really fucking sad.
[39:38.05]Don't do it.
[39:39.03]Don't you do it.
[39:40.75]I know it wants to.
[39:41.49]Don't do it.

[47:22.76]I fucking give up.
[47:23.58]Got him.
[47:24.08]Finally.
[47:24.90]Alright, come on.

[47:26.95]Reload!

[47:50.48]Yeah!
[47:51.22]I don't have time for this!
[48:00.64]It's over, I lose.
[48:18.78]Whatever.
[48:19.62]First try.
[48:20.62]First time on a grandma TV.
[48:22.64]Getting to level three.
[48:25.20]First time ever on a grandma TV.
[48:26.60]That's pretty good.
[48:27.74]Look it.
[48:28.02]See?
[48:30.44]I'm not even on there.
[48:42.66]Where's point blank?
[48:45.80]You think...
[48:52.47]What's special?
[48:56.01]What does that mean?
[48:57.01]Special?
[48:57.39]Richard, long time no see.
[48:58.58]I hope you're ready to hear your next objective.
[49:01.84]Your mission is to uncover the plan of the organization Kantaras.
[49:06.38]This is their headquarters.
[49:07.54]The hotel is actually a front for their- Who gives a shit?
[49:12.38]What is special?
[49:22.63]This is different.
[49:24.16]Alright.
[49:24.66]I'm ready.
[49:26.78]Add a little bit of warm-up and not fade in the game.
[49:31.58]Two seconds.
[49:32.22]And I shot the bellhop.
[49:54.49]Let's get 80% accuracy.
[49:55.44]By scanning, I can scan a whole room in a quarter of a second.
[50:24.57]That probably looks so fucking dumb right now.
[50:28.59]Got the bell off.
[50:41.14]Wow!
[50:42.38]Wow!
[50:42.83]Better?
[50:46.83]I'm doing better.
[50:54.86]Cleaned up what?
[50:55.42]Got that guy three times.
[50:58.00]Where is he?
[50:58.78]You drove the car over here.
[51:00.08]You want me to cheat?
[51:24.30]Fuck, that's not gonna work.
[51:26.24]Right in the head.
[51:28.36]Getting time here.
[51:30.56]Making the right moves.
[51:55.46]I'm guaranteeing that.
[51:57.67]What's going on?
[51:59.35]What am I doing?
[52:00.05]Oh, alright, we're good.
[52:05.15]Answer the door.
[52:06.01]Maybe answer the door.
[52:07.55]I've improved.
[52:33.78]Alright, come on, Grandma.
[52:40.65]Get your head.
[52:41.13]Oh, the guy in the back.
[53:01.28]Just needed some warm up, that's all.
[53:08.87]My face was just so angry.
[53:12.13]That was not me messing around, that was actually a fucking infuriated face.
[53:18.77]I don't even know what that looks like.
[53:20.22]I wouldn't know what that fucking looks like.
[53:26.78]Now I'm putting it on.
[53:28.52]Now I'm putting it on.
[53:30.16]I won't say.
[53:34.14]Why am I putting the... I don't have to do that.
[53:42.61]Not in this game.
[53:55.03]I've really improved since the Wii game.
[53:56.89]I've been trying.
[53:59.87]In the air, got him.
[54:01.03]All good.
[54:24.11]Is there a boss in the end of this?
[54:27.17]I don't remember this at all from the arcade.
[54:31.52]Was this in the arcade?
[54:43.22]I got a lot of continues.
[54:44.84]That's pretty good, actually.
[54:51.23]Oh, while we still...
[54:56.36]Fast.
[54:56.76]I don't care about accuracy, go.
[55:02.54]Just wait till we get to point blank!
[55:32.13]Just like I remember.
[55:33.25]I'm getting actually pretty nostalgic if I'm not gonna lie.
[55:36.55]Is this too loud?
[55:39.93]This is too loud, right?
[55:41.47]Is it?
[55:42.27]Oh, you stupid, who cares?
[55:46.73]Who gives a shit?
[55:50.29]Just do it!
[55:58.36]Turn it down.
[55:59.46]Turn it down.
[56:00.04]That's too loud.
[56:06.22]Who cares?
[56:07.34]Just do it.
[56:08.54]And then you hear fucking gunfire.
[56:10.36]Oh, man.
[56:11.31]No, no, no.
[56:12.47]Not good.
[56:12.87]Oh, my God.
[56:14.27]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[56:18.53]Alright.
[56:19.65]I want to play point blank while we have time here.
[56:25.49]I want to play point blank.
[56:27.80]So give me one second.
[56:29.69]I'll be right back.
[56:30.21]It's upstairs.
[56:30.67]I've got to go get it.
[56:32.01]Give me a moment.
[58:08.20]Alright, this is Point Blank.
[58:11.38]Point Blank is an old one.
[58:15.50]I'm like trying to go off camera and like drink the rest of this.
[58:18.96]I love this fucking game, by the way.
[58:23.18]This is one of my favorite.
[58:24.45]This is one of my favorite games ever.
[58:32.39]Anybody remember this game?
[58:33.43]I'm gonna move this out of the way.
[58:58.95]Oh, God, this game.
[58:59.87]No, this game is awesome.
[59:02.23]I'm very, very good at this game, by the way.
[59:05.21]I say that now, but who knows if that's a lie or not.
[59:07.37]It probably is a lie.
[59:12.00]Do I have the Jurassic Park one?
[59:13.68]I do not have the Jurassic Park game.
[59:15.90]Although, if I can get a reliable way to capture this shit, I'm willing to do... This TV ain't going anywhere.
[59:21.12]Let's be real clear about this.
[59:24.23]I physically can't move this TV from my room now.
[59:28.01]It's here forever.
[59:29.51]Until I decide to throw it in the trash.
[59:32.11]So... It's going to take like three people to get it out of here.
[59:37.79]So let's get our money's worth.
[59:41.22]Anyways.
[59:41.50]Let's play point play.
[59:44.78]This is just a game.
[59:45.94]Oh, they're going to change the... I'm going to write a good old...
[59:55.67]Good old point blank.
[60:00.28]Because it is a classic.
[60:08.58]There's a lot of point blanks, too.
[60:10.12]I have three of them.
[60:13.58]Is that even, that's not even right.
[60:22.26]Alright, there we go.
[60:27.60]I need to set this up to make sure it's perfect.
[60:33.97]Because it is a very, very high opportunity for me.
[60:38.38]Let me turn it up.
[60:40.18]We can raise the volume now.
[60:56.76]That's that good?
[61:00.50]Sounds good to me.
[61:03.10]Would you like to load the data?
[61:05.26]Uh, no.
[61:06.55]We want a new game.
[61:09.41]Arcade.
[61:12.15]Start.
[61:13.87]Here we go.
[61:17.57]Shoot at the window to prove this is not pre-recorded.
[61:22.06]Here.
[61:23.49]Whatever.
[61:24.27]It's not.
[61:24.65]Who cares?
[61:25.07]I haven't overscanned problems, though.
[61:27.83]Oh, well.
[61:30.07]What I remember, this game's all about point scoring.
[61:34.84]There's like a... What?
[61:36.98]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[61:39.36]Okay.
[61:45.46]Okay.
[61:45.82]One life is lost when a player fails to reach the quota or shoots an incorrect target.
[61:50.45]Don't shoot civilians...
[61:52.89]or the other color.
[61:56.37]See, look at this shit.
[61:59.39]It's like playing Mortal Kombat against yourself.
[62:01.11]Let's just do, we'll do training.
[62:04.25]We'll do this one.
[62:06.13]It's just pure skill.
[62:07.73]Shoot 15 targets, don't shoot the bombs.
[62:11.18]That's it.
[62:11.84]That's the whole name of the game here.
[62:35.83]Let's just start off with 100% accuracy right now, right off the bat.
[62:48.29]This is, you gotta keep the leaf in the air.
[62:49.55]Remember this one?
[62:50.03]This one's great.
[62:50.53]Shoot, shoot the falling leaf.
[62:52.54]Keep it in the air.
[62:53.16]Let's go.
[62:55.70]I got one bullet and I have five seconds to hit it.
[62:57.98]Kind of like WarioWare.
[63:02.04]This is the WarioWare of light gun games.
[63:03.88]These games are so good.
[63:09.67]They get much harder as you go.
[63:11.01]It goes like this.
[63:11.83]Here we go.
[63:16.54]Protect Dr. Dan and Dr. Dawn from Volcano's hot lava.
[63:19.12]It's just Mario, Luigi, or Bert and Ernie, however you want to look at it.
[63:22.36]20 seconds.
[63:24.02]Come on, Dr. Dawn, Dr. Dan.
[63:47.24]I missed.
[63:49.30]It's alright.
[63:50.16]I'll take 80% accuracy, that's pretty good.
[63:55.83]One more training round, then we're gonna get to the real game.
[64:00.59]Shoot 12 criminals, do not shoot the good guys.
[64:05.22]Shoot the criminals!
[64:30.81]Get that dust off my shoulder.
[64:40.68]Really, nobody said that.
[64:44.47]I did pretty good.
[64:50.31]Try the expert game.
[64:52.95]This thing wants me to do fucking expert already.
[64:55.29]We just did the training round, goddammit.
[64:59.28]Now we'll do beginner.
[65:01.89]And as the games progress, there's Point Blank 1, Point Blank 3.
[65:05.95]By the way, I'll show it in a minute.
[65:10.49]But this PlayStation 1, the new PlayStation 1s you can buy, are like little toasters.
[65:16.70]They're tiny.
[65:18.18]It's remarkable that this game can actually be played on this.
[65:21.04]It looks like an iPhone 6 Plus.
[65:23.86]That's how big it is.
[65:35.66]Whoa, expert.
[65:38.35]Alright, let's do it again.
[65:39.31]This time we're going to do beginner so we can warm up.
[65:42.61]When I was a kid, I remember playing this and trying and getting 100% on every single level.
[65:48.89]It was just truly remarkable.
[65:50.19]I was such a talented, gifted, young Mensa child.
[65:54.84]Basic rules.
[65:55.50]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[65:56.02]There we go.
[65:59.24]See, now we go.
[66:00.74]Let's go with William Tell.
[66:07.00]Shoot one apple.
[66:08.28]That's it.
[66:10.71]Got 10 seconds.
[66:15.39]Whoa!
[66:16.01]I almost shot him right in the head.
[66:16.89]I almost shot Bald Mario Bert.
[66:21.31]Oh no, Ernie.
[66:22.03]Bald Mario Ernie.
[66:24.09]Bald Ernie Mario.
[66:25.93]And Bald Bert Luigi.
[66:28.56]Let's see this one.
[66:34.96]I forget what this one is.
[66:37.00]Protect him from the hungry piranhas.
[66:40.25]And don't shoot the bombs.
[66:41.63]Got unlimited bullets, 20 second time limit.
[66:43.55]Let's go.
[67:13.61]the game has aim assist the game does not have aim assist the game has aim assist uh this game came out in like 19 97 there's no such thing as 94. there's no such thing as aim assist don't miss
[67:49.49]Someone's shooting for me off screen.
[67:51.69]That'd be so dumb.
[67:55.43]Someone's just off camera shooting for me.
[67:57.31]Alright, shoot 20 ninjas.
[68:00.61]Easy.
[68:00.85]Not easy.
[68:32.02]Aim assist.
[68:33.16]You tell me I got aim assist.

[70:18.33]I didn't do it for you.
[70:21.83]Shit.

[70:26.05]No, that was for you.

[71:27.35]I got one ball in 10 seconds.
[71:30.65]I gotta pick right.

[71:33.69]Gotta pick the right pack.

[71:43.89]Okay, I'll take it thanks game There we go very hard always do the very hard one first Shoot each meteorite before they reach the Earth.

[72:51.07]Shoot red, don't shoot blue, don't shoot bombs.
[72:52.77]You get five seconds.
[72:53.83]Get out of here.
[73:01.54]I redeemed myself with that one.
[73:08.64]Why am I a false prophet?

[73:16.27]Shoot 18 targets.

[73:54.80]Sorry about that.
[73:55.56]I'm sorry about that Shoot 26 targets don't shoot a bomb sure thing.
[74:04.33]Oh
[74:26.29]That sounds perverted.
[74:35.95]Well, that's because it is perverted.
[74:39.11]Very hard.
[74:39.77]First.
[74:40.19]Every time.
[74:40.63]Very hard.
[74:41.13]It's that light.
[74:45.47]Shoot 24 or more ducks of your color.
[74:47.39]Don't shoot blue.
[74:48.09]Don't shoot bombs.
[74:49.13]Shoot red only.
[74:51.03]Sure thing.
[75:14.89]Oh!
[75:16.93]I just barely got that.
[75:19.93]25, 24, Jesus Christ.
[75:23.72]I got it, I passed it.
[75:26.52]I remember this one, I love this one.
[75:28.52]Shoot the car 60 times.
[75:31.26]You ready?
[75:32.95]Check this out.
[76:00.03]Find the matching target, shoot eight or more.
[76:02.65]So I have to shoot eight of the matching target that I see on the lower left, I believe.
[76:14.75]Almost shot the bomb.
[76:17.50]They fuck with you here, they make everything look the same.
[76:19.06]Ooh!
[76:42.00]Yeah, we have a lot of light gun games, so I need to figure out the best way to capture these for real.
[76:47.66]Because I'm going to try to pull it in for tomorrow.
[76:51.15]Shoot 30 birds.
[76:51.95]Don't shoot any bombs.
[76:53.07]You got it.
[76:53.73]Easy.
[76:55.63]I was born for this.
[76:57.17]That was intentional.
[77:23.19]99%, come on!
[77:24.35]98%.
[77:27.91]I hate when that happens.
[77:36.16]Here we go.
[77:37.68]Now we fight a boss.
[77:38.54]We do like a boss mode.
[77:39.70]I believe it's a... I got three lines.
[77:44.54]Shoot the targets and watch the fireworks.
[77:49.08]Five seconds.
[77:58.40]Oh, got it!
[78:03.36]Got them all!
[78:05.48]That's actually pretty hard to do that.
[78:20.01]Hey, happy new year, everybody.
[78:21.69]Hope you had a good new year.
[78:28.36]Congratulations.
[78:29.82]You get it.
[78:38.64]Now we're gonna do the hard ones.
[78:41.29]I think it, uh, I'm pretty sure it randomizes every time.
[78:44.65]So even if you do beginner, you'll get different levels every time, I think that's how it works.
[78:56.84]Shoot, you're a necessary, oh, hold on.
[79:00.13]Oh, I get it.
[79:00.55]Okay.
[79:01.23]Enter initials in 10 seconds.
[79:06.67]What?
[79:06.93]I don't know.
[79:07.55]What are my initials?
[79:09.96]No, that's not my... No, it's Jax.
[79:13.58]It's Jax.
[79:17.32]Oh, yeah.
[79:17.88]Jax.
[79:19.06]That's my new fucking name now.
[79:20.20]That's what I want you all to call me.
[79:26.25]You think I look sweaty?
[79:27.99]It's because I am sweaty.
[79:29.23]I'm very fucking sweaty.
[79:31.83]I'm extraordinarily sweaty.
[79:34.49]To a fault.
[79:35.13]Yeah, these are by far my favorite Lycan games.
[79:45.28]Point Blank 2 is even better.
[79:47.76]But... I don't think... I'm not sure I ever played Point Blank 3.
[79:55.58]Point Blank 2 is awesome.
[79:57.68]And by the way, why have they never made one of these games?
[80:00.84]These games are so good.
[80:01.96]Why wouldn't they make a fourth one for like the Wii or the Wii U or anything?
[80:06.58]Make one for VR for all I care.
[80:08.02]I love these games.
[80:09.88]Namco, quit making like dog shit Pac-Man games and make one of these.
[80:13.82]This is just sitting on a shelf somewhere in Namco's vault.
[80:20.21]That sounds like a dog name.
[80:21.81]Now come here, Jex.
[80:25.26]Yeah, let's try the hard ones.
[80:26.94]Here we go.
[80:28.82]We got expert, and then we have very hard.
[80:30.62]So here we go.
[80:31.10]We're doing expert.
[80:31.84]This is where... This is not a joke, by the way.
[80:35.12]This is no joke.
[80:35.80]I might not fucking beat these.
[80:37.00]We might have to do these a few times.
[80:38.16]22 targets, 15 seconds.
[80:42.57]Let's give it a try.
[81:03.73]Why am I so bad at Wii shooters, but so good at this?
[81:06.59]Well, because the Wiimote is not, it's not a, this is a CRT TV.
[81:11.78]This is not like the Wiimote in the sensor with a little bit of lag.
[81:14.76]This is, I'm playing this on a fucking grandma TV.
[81:17.62]Aim for the center of the target, score 540 points.
[81:20.62]Alright, I gotta get this right in the middle.
[81:24.18]Nope, right in the corner.
[81:29.32]Wait, what?
[81:31.66]I just freaked out.
[81:32.68]What did I just do?
[81:34.40]I think I'm alright.
[81:36.38]I thought I had one.
[81:39.98]I thought I had one shot.
[81:44.07]Sorry.
[81:44.31]I thought I had only one shot.
[81:48.05]Come on, that was very hard on expert.
[81:50.57]This is gonna be hard too, fuck.
[81:51.97]Alright, don't.
[81:54.27]30 pinatas.
[81:57.63]10 seconds to get 30 pinatas.
[81:59.83]Alright, sweaty.
[82:11.02]I don't know if I did it.
[82:12.56]Oh!
[82:15.88]I got it.
[82:17.63]Make sure you do your stretches when you're playing a game standing up.
[82:19.65]Make sure you do your stretches.
[82:26.03]Alright, shoot 28 criminals.
[82:27.17]Don't shoot any innocent people.
[82:29.17]Don't shoot any civilians.
[82:30.99]And get the criminals only.
[82:32.32]Criminal.
[82:58.77]Although, I don't like having two lives though.
[83:02.86]I want more than two lives.
[83:07.48]I don't remember.
[83:08.16]Let's do this one.
[83:09.55]I think you have to get them all in one shot.
[83:11.61]Shoot all three balls with only one shot.
[83:14.19]You gotta land it right in the middle.
[83:15.53]Oh, this sucks.
[83:16.97]I might not get this.
[83:29.35]That's so hard.
[83:30.63]I got a hard one.
[83:42.53]Shoot the beehive and hit 18 or more bees.
[83:45.97]Remember, I'm relearning a lot of these minigames too.
[84:05.01]It's alright, we'll come back strong.
[84:10.62]It's alright.
[84:16.24]I got something continuous.
[84:43.68]I'm on national television right now.
[84:48.72]What do you mean on national television?
[84:50.98]What did I do?
[84:51.36]What have I done?
[84:54.02]This is where we lose, boys and girls.
[84:56.49]Very hard.
[85:01.03]Come on.
[85:01.79]I got a reboot here.
[85:05.69]Come on.
[85:25.48]Ah!
[85:25.92]Fucking hell!
[85:26.96]God damn it!
[85:27.92]I beat it, but Jesus Christ, I lost three lives!
[85:31.82]Oh!
[85:33.98]I think I... I think I blew my load there on the last level we did.
[85:38.74]Shit.
[85:45.06]Whatever, that one tears.
[85:49.38]Didn't get the life.
[85:56.22]What do you mean?
[85:57.80]That is like a lewd term, isn't it?
[86:00.81]Shit, it is.
[86:02.55]That's a really lewd term.
[86:03.87]Might as well get it out of the way.
[86:09.21]Why would I say that?
[86:10.16]What an imbecile.
[86:11.68]Alright, come on.
[86:12.32]Get it together here.
[86:14.48]Let's stand it off for like two or three hours.
[86:15.88]Two hours, come on.
[86:30.64]I think we're at that stage where I'm just seeing colors.
[86:33.48]How long am I gonna stand up here for?
[86:40.95]Like an hour and a half?
[86:41.57]It's like playing VR.
[86:59.45]God, I was about to say so many awful swears.
[87:13.56]Fuck.
[87:18.59]I'm like losing, I didn't like protein.
[87:44.88]over did that too.
[87:47.16]Officer Jax.
[87:51.15]Officer Jax reporting for duty, sir.
[87:59.44]Shoot all the balls.
[88:02.22]Ten seconds.
[88:17.94]Look at my vein!
[88:21.67]I'm overdoing it now.
[88:22.93]I'm overthinking it.
[88:23.97]Fuck.
[88:29.39]I'm just overthinking it now.
[88:30.65]I'm not in the zone anymore.
[88:32.37]We were in the zone for that last game.
[88:35.19]I got all 30 fireworks.
[88:36.31]Don't ever forget that.
[89:12.29]Chex is good.
[89:12.63]I feel like you're talking about Chex.
[89:18.89]Oh, not one of these ones.
[89:19.97]This is one where you get the line and you have to shoot 35 times and not miss.
[89:24.05]I could cheat on this.
[89:24.91]I could show you how you cheat on this.
[89:26.70]And it's very, very effective.
[89:27.96]But I don't know if I want to do that.
[89:28.92]No, I don't.
[89:29.48]Just get them all.
[89:39.24]Just get them all and show everybody that you're still good.
[89:42.88]If I missed three of those, it's over.
[89:48.35]Yes, you put your gun right after the TV screen and you don't miss.
[89:51.75]We don't do that bullshit on this stream.
[89:57.00]I'm good at the criminal ones.
[89:57.88]I'm good at shooting at criminals.
[90:34.45]Oh, eyes are watering.
[90:38.87]Did you see my fucking Nightwing shirt?
[90:40.69]That was really loud.
[90:45.56]Shoot the vultures, catch 12 hostages in a boat of your color.
[91:12.16]Yes, I didn't get 12.
[91:13.80]I got 13.
[91:14.04]That merchandise.
[91:20.35]I like this shirt.
[91:20.95]It's comfy and it gives me a nice warmth.
[91:23.57]Alright, here we go.
[91:25.95]Fireworks.
[91:27.85]I don't know if I'll do it.
[91:29.17]That was a tough one last time.
[91:31.82]Getting every firework is almost impossible.
[91:35.46]Especially on an expert.
[91:36.96]Let's try it.
[91:37.50]Five seconds.
[91:38.32]Good luck.
[91:39.24]Same amount of time.
[91:52.56]I got it last time, you don't even need to worry about it.
[91:59.82]Did somebody get 50 dollars?
[92:07.15]Uh, Edgemon gave 50 bucks earlier.
[92:10.29]I wonder if General was ever this mad at Chuck E. Cheese arcades playing these games.
[92:16.58]Yes.
[92:19.22]One time, this is completely unrelated, but one time I was playing mini golf.
[92:23.95]Something about mini golf just drives me insane.
[92:25.87]I don't know what it is about the mini golf, but let me turn this down.
[92:31.59]It's an important story.
[92:33.35]So, it's something about how slow the game is, the par of the course, not getting that first try.
[92:41.56]Mini golf enrages me, okay?
[92:44.34]I don't care who I'm with.
[92:45.70]I could be with my family.
[92:46.94]I could be with my girlfriend.
[92:48.42]I could be with some strangers that I've never met in my entire life, never met in my whole life.
[92:53.43]If I go like one or two strokes over par on a mini golf course, we could be fine the whole time.
[93:00.32]We'd be okay the entire time we've been out there.
[93:02.72]Maybe we had a couple of drinks.
[93:03.86]Maybe we had some food.
[93:04.76]Doesn't matter.
[93:05.90]The night is ruined when I go two or three over par.
[93:09.10]Because I get up to the fucking hole, and it's like I miss.
[93:12.93]I'm like two feet away.
[93:14.95]Miss.
[93:16.43]And at this point, it's embarrassing.
[93:17.77]Wait, what's going on?
[93:23.56]xbg x xbm xbm xbj xbj there you go Jackson xbj like three two top guys anyways uh so one time I so remember that's really embarrassing when you go like three over par at a fucking mini golf course
[93:44.61]It's an embarrassing endeavor because everyone's like, holy shit, dude, you can't even tap it in.
[93:49.08]Really?
[93:49.88]You can't hit it like four inches into the hole?
[93:52.66]Like, slow down.
[93:53.54]You fucking, you're like pissing me off because how bad you are at this, right?
[93:57.73]Well, that's at least what I think in my brain.
[94:00.05]So one time we were out, this was like 15 years ago.
[94:03.05]I was probably like 14.
[94:06.84]I was like three or four over par, two or three holes in a row.
[94:10.44]And I just lifted up the fucking golf club, the little baby mini golf club that has like the bubble gum colored neon green end.
[94:19.72]And I just smashed it into the ground and I think broke in half.
[94:26.22]And then I returned it.
[94:27.20]And I returned it and said that the thing was a little wobbly.
[94:31.66]The thing was broken in fucking half.
[94:34.67]Remember, I was like 14 and I broke it in half.
[94:37.61]Not at the end.
[94:38.83]In half.
[94:42.61]I smashed it.
[94:43.45]I couldn't take it.
[94:44.81]I fucking hate mini golf.
[94:46.05]Don't ever take my mini golf.
[94:47.05]Why was that just Mario 3?
[94:48.77]That was Super Mario Bros.
[94:49.97]3, the intro to Mario 3.
[94:50.86]Now that we have a little bit of warm up, let's try this again.
[94:55.20]Let's do expert again.
[95:01.64]We can do... Alright.
[95:10.31]Everything is very hard.
[95:11.19]I'm going to lose, but it's alright.
[95:13.63]I think this is the counting one.
[95:16.25]In order, shoot the numbers 1 to 16.
[95:21.40]10 seconds.
[95:22.42]16 bullets, by the way.
[95:33.44]Fucking restart the goddamn game.
[95:34.78]Fuck.
[95:46.83]Get out of here, get out of my fucking way.
[95:49.29]Shoot six clay targets of war, I probably have 20 bullets, 20 seconds.
[95:57.56]This is so hard.
[96:12.25]I got it.
[96:16.08]Six.
[96:16.94]Seven.
[96:21.46]Don't forget the fireworks.
[96:22.58]Never forget the fireworks.
[96:23.48]They're always coming up.
[96:24.30]Point Blank 2 is somewhere around here.
[96:25.64]I wonder where it is.
[96:29.20]Let's go with this one.
[96:30.24]I really don't want to do the piranhas.
[96:31.68]I'm going to lose so hard on that one.
[96:34.08]Just not in the darkness.
[96:35.78]The darkness makes it so impossible.
[96:39.43]25 seconds in limited shots.
[96:40.57]Good to go.
[97:03.30]Almost got her.
[97:06.64]Almost hit the lady.
[97:07.96]That was close.
[97:20.31]Do I have ghoul panic?
[97:22.79]I have a lot of things upstairs.
[97:24.81]But I think I'm going to try capturing the game tomorrow rather than pulling it through the TV.
[97:28.99]That's going to be a pain in the fucking ass.
[97:30.27]We'll see if I can figure it out.
[98:00.05]Yeah, so tomorrow I have this.
[98:02.49]Where is it?
[98:04.81]I have this thing, right?
[98:06.40]Which I can pull a video feed out.
[98:09.50]But the only problem is... I don't even know what just happened.
[98:12.60]It picks up for me.
[98:14.06]I'm going to have to split this between the PlayStation 1 and the TV.
[98:18.11]Because otherwise I can't see what I'm doing if I pull the video and audio through there.
[98:22.23]And I have to go through Elgato.
[98:23.15]It's going to be...
[98:36.80]This is like an audio-video converter to HDMI.
[98:45.56]Let's go with this one.
[98:46.48]Very hard, but it's okay.
[98:51.81]Shoot 32 targets or more.
[98:54.55]Don't fuck it up for 20 seconds.
[99:32.10]I swear to God I'm gonna put I'm gonna put the footage like on this TV even if I pull it in
[99:40.88]So don't worry.
[99:41.80]Tomorrow should be a much cleaner image than this.
[99:45.17]Even if I act like an idiot and do what I told you I was going to do.
[99:48.89]But it's fun to be on camera.
[99:50.07]You can see what I'm doing.
[99:51.11]You can see my arm, my hands going.
[99:52.50]What do I have to do?
[100:18.80]Wow, that would have been bad.
[100:23.60]Leave the TV shot.
[100:25.57]I don't know, something about, I really just don't, I don't like the scan lines that keep showing up.
[100:30.05]Every like five to 10 seconds, you'll see it.
[100:32.97]And then you won't be able to unsee it ever again.
[100:35.29]The scan lines go like every like seven seconds.
[100:39.94]And it drives me nuts.
[100:41.58]And I will do anything to stop that from happening.
[100:43.08]It drives me fucking crazy.
[100:48.74]Shoot the criminals!
[100:55.76]Did I get it?
[101:17.71]It's a feature.
[101:18.47]It's immersion lines.
[101:20.71]No, you guys don't want that shit.
[101:22.23]Trust me.
[101:22.93]I'm going to turn the TV a little bit.
[101:24.68]You won't even know what's happening.
[101:25.88]You won't even understand it's like a change.
[101:32.02]You like the scan lines add a nice little aesthetic.
[101:36.86]They like, they infuriate me.
[101:38.91]I didn't get the life, but it's alright.
[101:48.92]I got this one easily.
[101:49.90]This is a very hard on super hard mode.
[101:53.28]Gonna shoot 70 times.
[101:56.74]You know the technique.
[101:57.79]12 seconds.
[102:13.48]You get a nice 2005 vibe from this thing.
[102:18.88]I'll never lose that.
[102:20.08]You can make that three seconds easier.
[102:21.92]Or harder.
[102:22.36]It's a mystery level.
[102:25.05]We got a mystery level coming up here.
[102:30.35]Trick with this one, do it the second it's on the screen.
[102:33.01]Don't hesitate.
[102:51.25]Sand Aquarium time.
[102:54.73]That was way off.
[102:56.90]Shoot 34 octopi or more.
[102:59.60]No bombs, no bullshit.
[103:27.19]girl flashes my audience with my weenus don't talk like that I don't even know what this one is I'm so bad at these ones with the different colors they just get in my head just get out of my head get out of my head
[104:05.63]I'm terrible at the colors.
[104:07.25]I can't do the color ones.
[104:08.33]Just barely.
[104:14.00]Damn it.
[104:14.88]I'm terrible at those ones.
[104:18.54]I'm just panicking.
[104:19.56]I know.
[104:21.44]Get it over with because I'm not going to be able to do it.
[104:26.58]Shoot all three balls with one shot.
[104:28.28]Yeah, I got one shot.
[104:38.91]Fuck, I just don't know when to take the shot.
[104:42.56]Oh, that's so... I just did like the nervous neck scratch.
[104:51.40]That's how you know that that was not what I wanted.
[104:53.32]I'm doing like the... Shit, man.
[104:55.40]I'm good at this one.
[104:57.21]I'll get this one.
[104:57.69]This one will be no problem.
[105:01.65]48 birds.
[105:02.63]Wipe the sweat off.
[105:03.41]I'm good at this one.
[105:04.13]This is the Cuckoo Cocoa Puffs one.
[105:05.97]I got this one.
[105:06.53]25 seconds.
[105:06.71]Easy.
[105:42.79]Just like that kid in the meme.
[105:44.79]Yeah!
[105:47.27]Was it, uh, was that one, like the little baby?
[105:54.06]That's a colored one, I don't like these ones.
[106:10.10]Duck, duck, goose.
[106:18.00]Jesus.
[106:24.27]Okay, I'm sorry.
[106:25.09]I'm done.
[106:26.05]I won't do that ever again.
[106:39.16]I won't do that ever again.
[106:50.43]Sick!
[107:14.18]I would do it over again.
[107:15.30]I promise.
[107:24.35]The gins get it.
[107:25.37]Look, you want to see how much I've drank tonight?
[107:28.03]It's like a confusingly annoying, not quiet.
[107:31.15]Just do that in a minute.
[107:33.29]All of them.
[107:43.95]If you lose one, you lose them all, and I... Look, that's it.
[107:51.46]There's no alcohol in the whole house.
[108:00.56]I got it once.
[108:01.24]That is so hard to do that.
[108:03.58]Doesn't matter what difficulty.
[108:05.83]It's all five seconds of a go.
[108:09.83]Put the camera closer.
[108:10.45]You got it!
[108:12.08]No, actually, I'll rip it out of the computer.
[108:14.40]Can't do that right now.
[108:26.39]Go more like this.
[108:29.75]Yeah, that gives it a nice fucking grandma feel.
[108:31.41]Alright, let's do... Alright, we gotta give it another funny name, right?
[108:46.35]Dick.
[108:47.11]Right?
[108:47.85]Funny.
[108:48.07]Whatever.
[108:52.35]Who cares?
[108:55.25]XDD.
[108:57.11]XDD.
[108:59.33]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[109:06.57]Let's do one more on point blank one.
[109:09.06]Although I could fucking play this all night.
[109:13.19]I am getting a little, like, fatigued, though.
[109:16.93]We should never have started with Time Crisis.
[109:18.43]That game sucks.
[109:22.43]Objectively, that game sucks, okay?
[109:25.85]Look, everyone thinks it's a great nostalgia, light gun, cool, like it's a first ever light gun game.
[109:29.48]That's right, first ever.
[109:31.92]But the game, objectively, is terrible.
[109:33.38]So, like, you know, whatever.
[109:35.36]We all can agree on that.
[109:37.59]That makes sense.
[109:38.27]Time Crisis 1, first ever light gun game.
[109:40.85]Get it?
[109:41.17]It belongs in the fucking National Museum of Congress.
[109:44.44]But it doesn't belong in your PlayStation 1 in 2017.
[109:46.50]No, no, no, sir.
[109:54.90]It's a great game.
[109:55.55]I'm kidding.
[109:57.65]Well, sorry, because we have, like, fucking a few of them to play.
[110:00.29]We've got, like, I have one behind me we could put in.
[110:03.97]Although I want to keep playing, playing, playing.
[110:07.76]Alright, come on.
[110:08.72]Give me some new ones.
[110:09.32]Alright, shake the cobwebs off.
[110:14.63]Let's make this a good one.
[110:45.47]That freaked me out.
[110:45.99]They came in the same spot.
[110:50.23]Say 2018 or pre-recorded.
[110:51.43]I just did.
[110:56.23]Sweat check.
[110:59.50]It's not bad.
[110:59.96]It's not bad at all.
[111:08.04]Why did I think this?
[111:08.90]Whatever.
[111:09.24]I had this like grand scheme in my brain.
[111:43.58]I love this game.
[111:46.34]Alright, this time I'm only going to go like this.
[111:48.08]I'm going to shoot backwards and I'm only going to use the chat for guidance.
[111:51.64]Just fucking kidding.
[111:54.26]Criminals.
[111:55.26]Got it.
[112:19.61]Sometimes I just lock in and it's impossible to beat me.
[112:28.40]Officer Jax, I haven't failed any yet.
[112:30.64]This is very hard still.
[112:32.50]Alright, we gotta get the pinatas.
[112:50.61]Come on, I got 30, right?
[112:57.51]Yeah, they're piñatas.
[112:59.59]They're orange and yellow and they hang from the ceiling and you whack them with a fucking stick.
[113:04.53]Haven't seen this one yet.
[113:07.31]Shoot the dragon's head 24 times.
[113:12.07]15 seconds.
[113:13.34]Haven't done this one yet.
[113:28.39]You're like, I'm like, I'm just swaying back and forth.
[113:32.29]I can't imagine being like Officer Jerma on the case, like, Sprint!
[113:36.02]Freeze, dirtbag!
[113:38.16]Like, my knees, like, if you can see my knees right now.
[113:42.78]I'm like, I'll point the camera at me.
[113:46.02]I look fucking ridiculous.
[113:48.58]Shoot 24 of your ducks.
[114:15.92]I was gonna say, there wasn't even enough ducks on the screen to shoot at.
[114:19.25]I like Jecks better than Jerma.
[114:27.31]Get the tough one out of the way.
[114:30.07]Six, just be easy, guide your hand.
[114:33.78]20 bullets.
[114:51.51]I got it.
[114:54.71]Party time.
[114:58.79]That's what I'm saying!
[115:05.68]You like Jex better than Jerma?
[115:11.10]Oh well.
[115:12.47]Alright, same deal again.
[115:14.47]Right when it shows up, don't get, because it goes crazy after the first second.
[115:17.69]Alright, you know what, you know what, you got it.
[115:21.34]See?
[115:24.36]If you don't shoot that immediately, it just goes like.
[115:35.66]I did it.
[115:37.74]I haven't lost any lives either.
[115:40.24]Moving up in the world, right?
[115:50.69]That's the one I want.
[115:53.89]I got the extra life, good.
[115:55.73]Not that we're gonna need it or anything.
[116:00.22]Because I'm just that good.
[116:05.28]Oh no, not typing of the dead.
[116:07.90]Type the same three-letter word.
[116:09.88]Type four or more.
[116:10.86]I gotta get the right words?
[116:12.86]Oh Jesus.
[116:29.01]Did I do it?
[116:30.03]What's the heart?
[116:34.91]I'm sorry, there's no heart on a QWERTY keyboard.
[116:40.05]What is the heart on your keyboard?
[116:41.61]You don't have one.
[116:42.81]Don't give me crap for that one.
[116:44.73]It should have been the Windows key.
[116:47.21]Whatever, we're fine.
[116:48.69]I'm gonna lose this one.
[116:50.19]I'm almost certain of that.
[116:52.83]Shoot all balls.
[117:17.27]Asteroids Alright, come on Dr. Don Dr. Dan
[117:47.30]Oh shit!
[117:47.78]Did it.
[117:49.74]Look at this.
[117:52.98]Look at this egg.
[117:55.41]Look at this egg.
[117:56.91]Alright, hold on a second.
[117:58.03]I'm pretty much like a Skeksie from the Dark Crystal.
[118:00.49]Look at this.
[118:02.59]Jesus, man.
[118:04.84]Stand up straight.
[118:09.42]What is this one?
[118:10.34]Very hard?
[118:12.52]Fat.
[118:16.51]Oh wait, criminals!
[118:18.55]Freeze!
[118:47.71]Got it, got it, got it.
[118:54.25]Alright, this is the same one that we did before, the will you tell, on very hard.
[119:01.23]This time, I think he moves around in this one.
[119:02.71]Shoot one apple, one shot, and it takes only a few seconds.
[119:06.89]One bullet, he fucking moves around.
[119:12.75]What?
[119:21.45]Don't pull the PlayStation.
[119:23.32]It's right in the fucking head.
[119:27.76]Sorry.
[119:29.58]Sorry.
[119:30.12]Oops.
[119:35.45]He's dead.
[119:37.17]Protect Dr. Dan from the torches.
[119:43.68]I can't laugh.
[120:07.95]Two clubs.
[120:08.45]How many do I need?
[120:17.56]I can't, I got 30.
[120:19.18]That's a lot for the time limit here.
[120:22.33]20, that means I have to shoot one and a half every second.
[120:55.81]Got it.
[120:56.15]I just like, I give you guys like the uh-huh eyes.
[121:01.37]Losing it.
[121:01.87]Shoot all targets if you color.
[121:03.05]Gonna lose this one.
[121:08.35]Only red.
[121:22.37]That's tough because the pixel perfect, it's just hard to do that.
[121:26.91]That far away, technology from fucking 1991.
[121:30.13]Sorry, we'll try to get all the fireworks.
[121:36.37]See if I can do it.
[121:39.53]Hey Abby, I got to everything.
[121:41.29]I only lost one stage.
[121:46.69]Calm down, nice and easy, nice and calm.
[122:04.01]I'm like itching my... Alright, I already did it once.
[122:12.32]Look, just like Disney World.
[122:13.34]Remember when you go to Elsa's Castle?
[122:14.70]Because it's Elsa's Castle now.
[122:18.30]Why is it Elsa's Castle now?
[122:20.64]It's Cinderella's Castle.
[122:21.78]You can't just cover it in ice and call it something else.
[122:24.53]Just because the fucking kids these days would rather it be Elsa's Castle.
[122:29.45]No, that's too bad.
[122:32.28]You don't just paint it blue and put glitter on it and call it Elsa's Castle.
[122:36.08]You understand, Disney?
[122:42.43]Yeah.
[122:48.65]Alright, we'll do, let's do... Let's do one more very hard and then we'll try this.
[122:55.80]I'm going to put this awful fucking game in.
[123:13.31]Really?
[123:13.67]Oh, that was... That's still not better than what I did on the beginning.
[123:20.55]This is an insane light gun game.
[123:21.88]I don't even know what it is.
[123:22.58]We're going to play it, though.
[123:24.10]We'll do like three tonight.
[123:25.78]Maybe like another hour or so.
[123:29.04]I do want to do very hard one more time.
[123:33.31]Z, Z, Z.
[123:43.43]You see that?
[123:43.85]You see, like, the... It eats the screen, like, every, like, fucking five seconds.
[123:49.17]Stop eating my screen.
[124:00.26]Sick gun toss.
[124:04.72]No, not credits.
[124:06.38]No, not credits.
[124:07.80]You can shoot the credits.
[124:08.76]It's kind of fun.
[124:10.84]Let's do one more very, very, very hard.
[124:18.30]Hmm.
[124:22.79]Very hard.
[124:23.59]Let's try the pick the stuffed animal one.
[124:28.17]I feel like I'm gonna be alright here.
[124:31.52]Find the matching target, shoot 11.
[124:34.24]So you just have to do more and you have less time.
[124:36.08]So I think it's 30 seconds.
[124:37.84]Let's get it.
[125:04.24]It's going so fast!
[125:06.04]Jesus Christ!
[125:08.18]You don't even have time to do it!
[125:09.50]Ayayay, this is how I'm messing around here.
[125:17.97]Do I have windows in my house?
[125:21.13]Of course I have windows in my house.
[125:23.41]What are you fucking talking about?
[125:27.57]20 ninjas.
[125:30.40]It's on ultimate mode.
[125:54.06]It's going to be 18.
[125:55.18]Dang it, dog.
[126:01.04]Oh, well.
[126:09.16]I've got to get to the end of this one.
[126:10.93]Come on.
[126:11.35]And then I want to play the weird skeleton game.
[126:13.61]It's going to be awful, but, you know, I bought it.
[126:16.45]I'm a fucking psycho.
[126:47.17]I'll always beat that one.
[126:48.19]I swear to God I will.
[126:52.85]My eyes are bleeding.
[126:54.26]I'm so sorry that's happening to you.
[127:03.65]Okay, Dr. Dan from the volcano.
[127:18.47]Holy shit!
[127:19.61]That's so hard.
[127:23.74]My window is not open.
[127:24.82]The window's closed.
[127:27.78]It's closed.
[127:32.70]Go outside and shoot inside the window.
[127:34.94]Why would I do something like that?
[127:41.41]That's D-U-M-B.
[127:41.89]D-U-M-B.
[127:48.29]Full bullets unlimited.
[127:49.17]100%.
[127:50.61]That was actually pretty close.
[128:17.45]I almost did not.
[128:18.53]I almost didn't win.
[128:21.45]This is like Fruit Ninja.
[128:25.09]I'm not good at this one.
[128:26.01]Any of the ones that they zoom across the screen and they're a different color freaks me out.
[128:30.35]I'm really good at the just aim and point at things that appear on screen.
[128:33.86]Not zoom screen.
[128:57.05]Wow.
[128:58.65]You have to like completely focus.
[129:04.61]Was it really worth dragging my heavy ass TV?
[129:06.69]That's a funny story about this TV.
[129:08.05]This is not my TV.
[129:10.80]I had to, do you know how difficult it is to track down a large, large, remember this is, I'm doing light gun, right?
[129:18.10]So it has to be big enough where I can actually use the system.
[129:20.94]This is so hard to track one of these down.
[129:27.08]Did I already lose?
[129:28.12]It's already fucking over.
[129:34.26]The thing is just not perfect.
[129:43.23]Yeah, it's not easy to find a TV like this.
[129:46.07]I don't even know what the hell I'm gonna do with it, to be honest.
[129:48.71]I'm gonna lose this one too.
[129:55.99]I'm gonna try to get him on the second box.
[130:04.40]Breaking my own fucking rule.
[130:16.48]Jesus Christ!
[130:18.78]I passed it, but I've still lost every life.
[130:26.24]play Cuphead with this?
[130:27.24]How would you even, can you even do that?
[130:29.15]I don't think you can even do that.
[130:31.39]This is like an old CRT TV.
[130:35.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah, just pick one.
[130:36.85]Oops.
[130:37.01]Remember the leaf one from the very beginning, like an hour ago?
[130:53.82]This is much harder, it swoops around like crazy.
[130:57.60]It's gonna, five seconds, it's gonna go like this.
[131:01.77]Shoot the following week.
[131:09.03]What do you mean you'd be flashed?
[131:18.04]I'm talking about the screen, the screen just flashes white.
[131:24.34]It's gonna be, it's probably gonna be worse tomorrow if I could figure out a way to capture this shit and actually pull it into OBS.
[131:31.18]I'm gonna have to figure out... Not working!
[131:33.60]That almost didn't work.
[131:55.03]Again, right at the buzzer.
[131:56.98]Jesus.
[131:59.00]It sounds like my hand is killing me.
[132:03.57]Right on time.
[132:06.47]24 targets.
[132:07.15]This one is the one where they just flip around real fast in different order.
[132:27.09]Okay, I almost blew it.
[132:36.38]Is Jex going to TwitchCon?
[132:39.08]Jex went to TwitchCon this past year.
[132:40.74]I'm assuming it probably would.
[132:43.92]I don't know.
[132:44.20]I think conventions for me this year.
[132:45.66]I want to be low-key man this year.
[132:48.38]What do I have to do?
[133:08.74]You dumb fuck!
[133:09.38]You dumb fuck!
[133:10.34]Fuck!
[133:11.66]I beat it up!
[133:12.40]Slow down!
[133:18.68]You're putting me on your Snapchat story so all your friends see how cute I am.
[133:25.45]Get that for your Snapchat.
[133:26.35]I'll give you a good Snapchat on this one.
[133:33.89]Alright, aim for the center!
[133:35.53]Get that fucking cream filling!
[133:49.68]I even cheated and it didn't matter.
[133:54.32]That's how you know it's fucking calibration whenever you go after.
[133:56.55]Let's do this one.
[134:07.37]They come down and they act erratically.
[134:10.39]The technique is to try to shoot them before they even hit the parachute portion.
[134:38.09]Can't even cheat right.
[134:41.51]That's the only time we've cheated the entire time we've played anything tonight.
[134:43.99]I'm gonna lose this one too.
[134:53.80]As long as you slow down and you just actually pace yourself.
[135:25.39]pace yourself.
[135:27.39]Once you start spam shooting, that's when you start hitting bombs and it doesn't end well for you.
[135:32.60]I've been there.
[135:37.36]Can't even cheat right gives you constipations.
[135:40.04]52 ninjas.
[135:40.20]What?
[136:24.74]That was everything and very, very hard, right?
[136:27.12]One continue, two continues.
[136:29.18]Here we go.
[136:29.80]Come on.
[136:30.10]To cap out point blank one.
[136:32.36]Get it.
[136:33.97]Don't panic.
[136:34.51]Use your stance.
[136:35.87]This is very hard.
[136:38.55]This is the hardest.
[136:39.13]It doesn't matter.
[136:39.79]Shh.
[136:39.93]Shh.
[136:52.90]You miss it one time, you're fucked.
[136:55.24]It's alright.
[137:02.61]Same spot, do the same thing again.
[137:04.33]Yep.
[137:05.31]That just shows you absolute total muscle memory, how my body has trained itself, where to shoot, at what point in the screen.
[137:13.66]It's a bunch of bullshit.
[137:16.68]That was the hardest difficulty in the entire game.
[137:20.14]I have to be, that's not higher than when I first did it on beginner?
[137:24.59]I guess not.
[137:27.73]Two continues.
[137:31.13]Give me sharpshooter.
[137:31.77]Oh well.
[137:39.88]So now let me, let's shoot the credits first.
[137:44.60]We're gonna have to put our name in here, good name.
[137:55.57]a good name quick how about uh nope no I want it to be nope spit n jex z jex is the best really I can't I can't beat jex he's not beatable alright let me go get the uh other game uh well let me shoot the credits first and we'll go from there
[138:23.44]This is a fun game, though.
[138:25.00]If you have any access to... And look, you can do this on... You can get an emulator.
[138:29.90]You can use your mouse as the gun.
[138:32.93]There's a lot of hoops you gotta jump through.
[138:35.51]But if you can ever get your hands on a light gun and a PS1 and an old grandma TV, this is a lot of fun.
[138:44.62]It's fun just to be able to do this.
[138:45.86]Because, man, CRTVs versus HDTVs is a lot different.
[138:50.56]So the amount of...
[138:54.44]It's so perfectly one-to-one when you actually play on a CRT TV.
[138:59.02]I don't think they'll ever be able to do it ever again, to ever have it be one-to-one, like true, actual one-to-one, like it is on CRT.
[139:06.95]Let's just play it.
[139:07.55]Credit, free play, whatever, who cares.
[139:15.70]You have everything but the gun.
[139:17.28]These guns are, they're not, what's it called?
[139:20.78]Credit, am I missing something here?
[139:25.12]Probably.
[139:28.30]Whatever.
[139:31.61]I'm pretty dumb, probably, yeah.
[139:32.85]I think they're like 15 bucks, maybe 20 bucks for one of the, I won one of the hammer ones, one of the when you shoot.
[139:40.39]I think those are a little bit more expensive.
[139:41.51]I thought that's the one I bought, but I guess that's not the case.
[139:45.01]Let me just go grab the other game.
[139:47.01]We will get started here in a second.
[139:49.71]I'll see you in a minute.
[141:36.44]I can't speak to how this one's going to be.
[141:42.62]But this one is called Crypt Killer.
[141:53.89]Crypt Killer, arcade shooter action.
[141:59.98]This is probably going to be really bad.
[142:05.02]So I cannot guarantee that anyone will have any fun.
[142:14.63]Crypt killer sounds so 30s.
[142:17.75]Stand in front of the door and place the eyes of guidance on the door.
[142:21.45]Oh, I thought they were talking to the thing.
[142:22.63]Oh, stand in front of the door.
[142:24.03]Alright, whatever.
[142:26.03]This isn't a light gun game, right?
[142:27.79]That's what it said.
[142:28.33]Why don't this be really fun?
[142:32.04]Crypt killer.
[142:33.14]Let's turn this one off.
[142:40.73]Game start.
[143:07.39]Okay, what?
[143:09.74]How do I use... I didn't even calibrate the gun!
[143:24.65]What the fuck?
[143:29.66]No, I wanna... No, unplug this.
[143:38.86]There we go.
[143:39.54]Okay.
[143:42.10]I have no idea what's going on.
[143:44.94]Why is this on the screen still?
[143:51.99]Are we playing?
[143:53.93]Is this the game?
[143:56.15]Okay.
[144:08.14]This is Professor Xavier.
[144:12.64]Do I have to, I don't even know if I use this.
[144:14.74]I just threw a bomb.
[144:22.67]I can't shoot the gun.
[144:29.08]Be careful.
[144:47.85]Okay.
[144:47.99]Let's try it again.
[145:11.21]Time for the next one.
[145:12.47]There's another Time Crisis back here I would want to probably put in.
[145:15.41]This is weird.
[145:18.07]I'd like to save some of the other ones for later.
[145:21.75]But this is Time Crisis Project Titan.
[145:23.87]Where does this one even fall?
[145:26.25]In the series, I wonder.
[145:29.81]I'm using a Namco gun on a Konami game.
[145:36.66]Konami.
[145:37.26]Konami.
[145:39.10]It's working now.
[145:40.00]Maybe that was weird.
[145:44.14]Press the Start button.
[145:47.16]Start.
[145:47.80]Maybe Game Options?
[145:50.78]Now I can't do anything.
[145:51.58]Let me see if I can activate the light gun with the controller.
[146:05.68]Difficulty.
[146:06.78]Gun Looseness.
[146:12.50]Gun Adjust.
[146:23.19]Gun adjust.
[146:25.62]Gun adjust.
[146:35.95]That's not going to work.
[146:37.03]Gun adjust.
[146:40.99]Gun adjust.
[146:43.99]one player two player this no this is this is uh I wasted I wasted some money on this one might not be compatible with this light gun that sucks um okay well let's try this time crisis because I want to play point blank two and point blank three tomorrow
[147:13.17]Because I know I'll put at least an hour into both of those games.
[147:18.45]And let's talk about tomorrow's stream because I'm kind of juggling going back and forth to my parents' house.
[147:29.37]Because I'm not sure if everybody knows this or not, but my mother recently had surgery.
[147:33.95]uh she's completely fine this is not a any situation that's a bad situation or anything but she needs like help uh moving around and stuff so I think I'm supposed to go over there tomorrow at some point so I'm the next obviously the last week of streams it was kind of all over the place I didn't even stream at all last week
[147:56.23]but until it might not be against the realm of possibility that I'll have to just kind of juggle everything around and stream maybe not at the time that you think I'm going to stream I might stream early tomorrow I might have to push it back it depends on how long I need to be there for so bear with me over the next week because it's already been one week and she's starting to completely recover here in the next week so we'll be back to completely to normal
[148:27.57]next week.
[148:28.47]Not this coming week, obviously, like next week.
[148:31.57]So, yeah, I just, I want to make sure I say that because I don't, I don't want to like have you guys think I'm just kind of like disappearing and no, no, I'm just going to stream like once in a week and he'll never fucking see me again.
[148:42.92]Like, I don't really want you to think that.
[148:45.94]Let's try this time crisis out.
[148:50.22]So if I can't stream tomorrow, I will make sure to tell you guys.
[148:54.42]There'll be a sus command.
[148:56.64]I'm not sure I want to tweet about it anymore.
[148:58.15]I feel like it's getting to a point where, like, half of my tweets the last, like, few, like, at least a month or two have been, Hey, uh...
[149:06.49]I'm streaming like next time, not today.
[149:09.27]See you next time.
[149:10.13]I don't really want to do that anymore.
[149:13.07]I'd rather just have it be a sus command.
[149:14.57]I've got to think of some tweet jokes to make.
[149:18.77]I had a good one the other day.
[149:19.83]I really did.
[149:21.59]It goes through my brain and then I don't do it.
[149:23.91]And then I never do it.
[149:28.17]But this is the other time crisis that I have.
[149:32.42]I have, I think,
[149:37.23]This looks good.
[149:39.65]Now that I had some warm-up time, although I hate having to hold the button.
[149:45.49]I should have bought the, I really should have got the pedal, if it even exists for the PlayStation 1, because that sucks having to go like that.
[149:53.77]It really does, holding the button down.
[149:56.97]How much did I spend on all this?
[150:00.59]That's a good question.
[150:04.43]That's fine.
[150:07.85]I spent probably, I don't know, five bucks?
[150:14.01]No, that's a lie.
[150:21.36]I don't know.
[150:24.30]$500 maybe total?
[150:25.72]$450?
[150:25.76]Well, that's not true.
[150:27.20]That doesn't include the Dreamcast that I have that's back in the other room, the PlayStation 2 that's down here.
[150:34.62]I'm going to have to keep this TV here because we're going to have a lot of old games to play.
[150:39.24]It's just a question of capturing them.
[150:40.72]I didn't want to capture this because of the flashing on the screen.
[150:45.29]I mean, in total, I'll probably spend about two grand.
[150:49.39]I'm talking every Dreamcast game, every PlayStation 2 game, every fucking console, everything.
[150:53.77]Yeah.
[150:58.12]How much was the TV?
[150:58.92]The TV was free.
[151:01.32]Somebody was giving this TV away because it sucks so much to put this anywhere.
[151:05.03]And nobody wants this in their house.
[151:12.47]If I'm going to think of it, it's probably like between $1,500 and $2,000 for everything.
[151:19.78]But here's the thing.
[151:22.30]Where do you think that money came from?
[151:26.52]Right?
[151:27.60]Like, this is a lot of money from you guys, right?
[151:34.38]I'm putting this back into the fucking stream.
[151:37.01]Where is he?
[151:38.77]Where is he?
[151:44.97]No, but for real though, you guys want to know, a large portion of the money you guys give me, I buy all this fucking crazy shit.
[151:55.21]That's kind of what I do with it.
[151:57.31]That's kind of what I do with the money.
[151:59.45]And buy a shitload of cryptocurrencies and lose it all.
[152:01.70]But it's alright, not a big deal.
[152:02.68]It's alright, not a big deal.
[152:04.68]Let's play.
[152:07.32]The money came out of the Vive fund.
[152:08.70]No, that's not true.
[152:13.02]Easy.
[152:14.40]No, I wanna... Can I only do easy?
[152:23.50]I think, oh wait, no, I think that's all, wait.
[152:26.20]Okay, there we go.
[152:27.18]Story mode.
[152:28.64]This one's, I think, a little bit, another year or two later.
[152:33.42]Sponsored by Bald's Coin.
[152:35.12]Let's watch the cutscene.
[152:39.88]I do want to show you the PlayStation 1 because it's tiny and weird.
[152:46.22]We've been reading your email, Marissa, and you've been a very, very naughty girl.
[152:53.04]Action!
[152:53.46]Why did I skip the cutscene?
[152:57.33]I just said let's watch the cutscene.
[152:59.45]Just pull your fucking pants up.
[153:05.67]Let's do it.
[153:11.26]This is a new game.
[153:14.04]This one's, I don't like this one.
[153:18.02]This one's slow.
[153:22.65]It's like laggy.
[153:24.08]Thank God it has the 007 Goldeneye, Guy Got Shot sound.
[153:53.22]You know what's something I'm noticing?
[153:56.08]I'll tell you in a second.
[153:58.13]So, hold on.
[154:02.07]Fuck you.
[154:02.61]Get out of here.
[154:03.15]Fuck off.
[154:04.67]Really?
[154:10.73]So, in the newer games, the red circle comes around the enemy when they're about to hit you, when you know they're going to shoot at you.
[154:19.86]That's not in these games, huh?
[154:23.83]You have to be very, very careful.
[154:32.30]Fuck.
[154:44.50]Got him.
[154:45.16]Yeah, the red circle that goes like, so you know you have to duck back down.
[154:49.03]I kind of missed that.
[154:54.48]Makes it much easier.
[154:56.44]Wow, really?
[154:58.23]There it is!
[155:00.33]Shit!
[155:01.77]Alright.
[155:24.66]Get there with all continuous plan.
[155:26.22]Screen gun!
[155:29.38]Shoot the helicopter?
[155:33.47]No, not yet.
[155:57.93]I'm doing alright.
[155:58.51]Whoa, what the fuck?
[156:00.51]You didn't give me any time at all.
[156:10.68]Stupid fucking hook.
[156:11.84]I need an extra life bad right now.
[156:28.31]My accuracy's gotten better.
[156:29.83]It was like 49% last game.
[156:31.83]Warmed up a little bit.
[156:33.71]Bingo.
[156:34.97]Shoot him!
[156:48.59]Traitor!
[156:49.81]That's the same guy.
[156:54.23]Same actor, look it up.
[157:17.53]Sucks.
[157:17.97]Whatever.
[157:18.59]That was a load of horseshit, y'all know it.
[157:26.44]Got it.
[157:55.84]Not this time.
[157:57.26]Got him.
[157:58.58]Got two of them.
[158:26.49]Nothing.
[158:27.09]Nothing at all.
[158:44.34]Somebody warmed up!
[158:49.62]Oh shit, the Swedish chef!
[159:14.70]Gotta be quiet, sorry.
[159:15.76]Ah!
[159:16.29]Is he dead?
[159:17.73]Okay.
[159:18.19]Poor guy doesn't stand a chance with just a knife.
[159:43.99]was that guy like got uppercutted in portal combat landed came up and died that's what I help why are they all dressed like tennis players
[160:22.54]Not fucking around anymore, guys.
[160:23.76]We're gonna stay at 60 seconds the whole damn time.
[160:26.88]Boss?
[160:27.14]Alright, this is the real boss.
[160:29.84]You try and save your spy girlfriend.
[160:31.22]Come on, bring it on.
[160:51.57]On the Schwarzenegger?
[160:58.25]What the fuck?!
[161:00.69]Oh.
[161:02.47]New game mechanics.
[161:46.58]Shit!
[161:47.83]Where the fuck is he?
[162:21.76]Come on, what do you got?
[162:28.16]Woo!
[162:31.90]Got him.
[162:32.40]Fuck you.
[162:33.80]Jesus.
[162:36.76]That was much harder than I thought it was going to be.
[162:40.55]Did I get taller?
[162:47.71]He's turning into the game, saying only a few words.
[162:54.03]It's actually really hard to talk and do this at the same time.
[162:58.37]Just enjoy my immensely impressive gameplay.
[163:02.43]You don't need to lean in person to lean in the game?
[163:11.66]I got it from my father.
[163:12.52]My father and my mother used to do this when they were playing Mario, the old school Mario.
[163:16.02]I can't even talk.
[163:19.41]No, that's volume up.
[163:26.76]That's not funny.
[163:28.20]Anyway, so my mother, when we used to play Mario together, Super Mario Brothers, the first one, first game I ever played in my life.
[163:35.28]So my father and my mother, when they would jump in Mario, they would go like this.
[163:40.41]So let's say I had a big gap to cross in Mario.
[163:43.59]They would have to go like this.
[163:45.81]And they would go with the jump.
[163:48.01]That's why I do it.
[163:50.66]Great story.
[163:52.48]Back to the action.
[163:56.32]Some high quality Jex lore.
[164:01.99]I had this, I had this TV.
[164:03.95]Did you really?
[164:19.34]No damage.
[164:19.80]Hold on.
[164:20.12]No damage.
[164:20.50]Got him in the back.
[164:24.55]Didn't think I saw that guy.
[164:26.41]I got eyes like a fucking piranha.
[164:29.31]I would have had him.
[164:34.91]I would have got him.
[164:49.21]Wow.
[164:50.25]That was bullshit.
[164:50.89]Did I move?
[164:53.93]Shit.
[165:19.36]I'm just getting tired of this.
[165:29.47]Fuck you.
[165:38.83]Ah!
[165:39.43]The lactic acid is building up in my fucking forearm!
[165:49.69]Let's go.
[165:51.09]I gotta stop panicking.
[165:53.75]I can't even shoot that guy.
[165:56.05]Alright, let's calm it down here.
[166:30.57]I really do go like this.
[166:33.57]This is more immersive than VR.
[166:34.89]It is, I'm sorry.
[166:35.67]It just is.
[166:37.11]That's not even right.
[166:38.07]Why would I even say something so grossly incorrect?
[166:56.28]Wow, that was close.
[166:59.06]Come on!
[167:03.22]Jesus, that was bullshit.
[167:08.43]Don't come out.
[167:13.61]Game's getting a little hard.
[167:31.42]Warning, you will be flashed.
[167:33.77]Random people coming in probably just like, what the fuck is going on here?
[167:47.78]Really?
[167:48.68]Really?
[167:49.46]Really?
[167:50.42]Really, God?
[167:51.58]Really, God?
[167:52.20]God?
[168:03.61]Here we go.
[168:11.04]I'm so silent.
[168:19.94]I'm supposed to be like being like, whoa guys, so what I'm doing here is I'm aiming at the enemies and I'm shooting with the light gun.
[168:27.84]That's what I'm supposed to be doing, right?
[168:29.47]Gonna get funny commentary.
[168:30.77]Hey, what are these, soldiers?
[168:35.77]Yes!
[168:40.23]Who could've thought?
[168:49.18]I missed everybody.
[169:00.19]No time for that?
[169:00.91]Oh, there he is again.
[169:04.49]Leave a like if you think it's huge.
[169:07.82]Don't make him escape!
[169:08.66]I repeat, don't make him escape!
[169:10.30]Get in the taxi!
[169:18.29]Welcome to Caruba, senor.
[169:22.90]I looked over at the webcam and I thought this was the divider between my legs.
[169:26.74]And I was like, why do I have such tiny legs?
[169:31.08]I thought that was the divider.
[169:32.18]And I thought I was standing in a different... My legs were spread out.
[169:36.13]They're not.
[169:36.81]But they are.
[169:37.73]I thought I was standing like this.
[169:51.18]Somebody drew me.
[169:52.88]Somebody drew me.
[169:54.62]Drew me.
[169:55.10]Somebody drawed me.
[169:56.30]Somebody drew me.
[169:57.60]Why does that word not sound right?
[169:59.12]Somebody drawed.
[170:01.30]Somebody drawed me.
[170:02.64]Somebody drawed on me.
[170:06.08]Wow!
[170:24.41]Who did it?
[170:27.17]There was nobody.
[170:28.49]Relax.
[170:33.01]Guy on the roof, got him.
[170:58.67]Don't even get a chance.
[170:59.53]None of you got a fucking chance.
[171:02.69]None.
[171:04.81]Alright, boss done.
[171:14.14]I almost just pulled the whole thing down.
[171:15.28]Let's see who the boss is.
[171:19.50]I've never played this one.
[171:23.71]This is one I've not encountered.
[171:27.85]Funny scream That's a lot of red guys
[171:58.52]Fuck you, man.
[171:59.55]Nobody...
[172:25.49]give me a fucking great man
[172:58.59]Fuck me, Jesus Christ.
[172:59.93]I swear to God, you fucking dummy.
[173:42.19]I can't, what?
[173:45.04]What was that move?
[173:46.00]I'm gonna lose.
[173:47.18]I'm just panicking.
[173:47.94]I got him.
[173:48.36]Man, that was tough.
[174:16.13]You'll never find out the truth, Mira.
[174:18.43]You're just a pawn in our game.
[174:26.64]I'll kill you all if you're next, Miller.
[174:30.96]He double-crossed me.
[174:32.38]Is it me holding him?
[174:33.52]Get him.
[174:34.66]He's at Rio Oro.
[174:38.56]His lab, Rio Oro.
[174:41.99]An island.
[174:50.38]Great.
[174:50.66]Alright, this is my last attempt here.
[174:53.68]I got one more continue, we're at the last level.
[174:55.52]Look, this is only three levels in every single time crisis.
[174:58.98]Just trying to get to the boss, I probably won't.
[175:09.11]I'm a little tired.
[175:28.52]As long as you stay over 40 seconds, you're fine in these games.
[175:30.99]That's a fact.
[175:33.79]Oh no, my camera.
[175:34.93]My camera's gonna fall.
[175:37.41]It's gonna fall.
[175:38.95]Nothing I can do about it.
[175:40.17]I'm sorry, camera's gonna fall.
[175:41.53]Last continue?
[175:42.58]Oh...
[175:58.43]That's not cool.
[176:09.93]Whoops.
[176:12.76]Well... I want to play Point Blank again.
[176:20.78]Don't worry, Point Blank 2 and Point Blank 3 are both going to be tomorrow.
[176:23.62]Those are some of my favorite games.
[176:29.19]Yeah, that's it.
[176:31.54]We're going to try a different tactic tomorrow.
[176:35.04]Again, stream might be pushed around a little bit.
[176:40.58]I can't guarantee it.
[176:42.20]But there'll be a guaranteed stream tomorrow.
[176:44.41]I'm going to try.
[176:46.15]But if there is a reason why, I'll let you know beforehand.
[176:52.45]It'll be on the title of the stream and everything.
[176:57.71]This is actually a lot of fun.
[176:58.86]I just wish the capture wasn't as fucked up as it kind of is.
[177:03.14]I know a lot of people say that's not like a huge deal, but I mean, it is.
[177:05.68]I mean, it is.
[177:11.22]With that, I'm going to just kind of, my whole room is completely redesigned.
[177:14.62]So redesigned, like, oh yeah, I designed it.
[177:16.72]I put up some paintings and I moved some furniture around.
[177:19.28]It looks beautiful.
[177:20.04]It looks fantastic.
[177:24.66]Okay.
[177:26.35]Let's put this down.
[177:26.99]We're going to do Point Blank 2 and 3 tomorrow.
[177:32.11]I have another one or two games for tomorrow, maybe.
[177:36.05]But I hope you enjoyed.
[177:37.19]We're going to do the bits.
[177:38.85]If you just stumbled in and saw this mess, thanks for sticking around.
[177:43.66]Hopefully you had some fun.
[177:46.92]With that, let's move over here.
[177:50.84]Let's talk about bits.
[177:54.51]bits that I missed a lot of them I need to move the mic back as well hold on for just temporarily
[178:21.23]That's actually the best I can do with the mic right now.
[178:25.97]I can't really move it that much further.
[178:28.91]That's as far as it's going to go.
[178:33.66]Okay, and with that... Let's start back here.
[178:44.28]Thank you, Sam.
[178:45.26]Sam, in for the $1.
[178:46.26]What did the pirate say when he turned 80?
[178:47.86]He said...
[178:52.65]Uh, aye, matey.
[178:56.19]Oh.
[179:01.20]Oh.
[179:02.56]I get it.
[179:04.41]Thanks, Styx Renegade for the one dollar.
[179:06.10]Roses red, I am not alone.
[179:07.50]It was the appropriate time to use this poem.
[179:09.78]The time had passed, but I would like to say these special words to you today.
[179:13.10]Now to the point, the violets are blue.
[179:16.30]I think we can all agree that we all love you.
[179:18.88]Well, maybe not all of us, maybe not love, love, especially since some of the memes were sent to the heavens above.
[179:23.90]But despite all that, I just mainly wanted to say, Jeremy, happy belated Valentine's Day.
[179:27.72]Dab.
[179:28.44]Thanks, man.
[179:29.94]That was a big paragraph.
[179:32.42]Brew.
[179:33.74]Hey, I wrote you a brew via yellow.
[179:37.84]Thank you, Sticks.
[179:38.80]Hopefully you had a good Valentine's Day as well.
[179:41.57]Hope you all had a good Valentine's Day.
[179:43.59]I haven't seen you guys in like a week.
[179:46.47]I forget that sometimes.
[179:51.98]I think this is probably the only time since I've been streaming three times a week, four times a week, that I've ever not streamed for like a full week.
[180:00.75]That's true, right?
[180:02.93]Maybe once before during like E3 or something?
[180:05.13]I can't remember.
[180:06.86]I hate to be away for this long, I really do.
[180:08.56]Because I have so much fun doing this.
[180:10.02]It's just life kind of gets in the way sometimes.
[180:14.62]And it will continue to.
[180:16.84]Like I said, I need to... Family at this moment is priority number one.
[180:22.37]So if I can't stream, I just can't.
[180:24.43]And we'll do it when we can, you know?
[180:28.03]But happy Valentine's Day, belated to everybody.
[180:31.84]Thank you, Antrita, for the $1.
[180:33.18]I saw a kid on my way back to work today that looked like you, so I pulled over and kicked him in the head.
[180:38.68]Well, first of all, that's absolutely something you should not be doing.
[180:44.07]That's, first of all, very, very, very inappropriate behavior.
[180:47.55]That should be corrected.
[180:49.27]I'm not sure how, but that was very mean.
[180:53.15]But thank you for the $1.
[180:54.81]Hopefully you sort out why you're injuring people and hurting people that don't deserve it.
[181:01.57]Thank you, Bisk, for the 69 cents.
[181:04.56]Did you say cheers 69?
[181:05.60]Thanks a lot, man.
[181:07.14]Sly161, thanks for the $2.
[181:08.88]My birthday was yesterday.
[181:09.82]Can I get a cool birthday song, please?
[181:13.76]Yeah.
[181:14.54]There.
[181:15.00]Let's get you a happy birthday, Sly.
[181:19.73]Happy birthday.
[181:20.99]Wait, yesterday, yeah, it's 9 p.m.
[181:22.45]still.
[181:22.67]Never mind.
[181:22.95]I was going to say, what if it was like midnight?
[181:24.49]Then it'd be the next day.
[181:25.83]What am I talking about?
[181:27.39]Let's see.
[181:27.75]Happy birthday to you.
[181:33.22]Here we go.
[181:34.14]Here it is.
[181:34.64]Happy birthday to you.
[181:38.46]And it is the... This is by Alvin and the Chipmunks, I believe.
[181:46.65]Is it?
[181:48.09]Why is it not even playing?
[181:51.11]What's going on here?
[181:53.19]Why is this not playing?
[181:57.41]Alvin and the Chipmunks are supposed to be singing happy birthday to you right now.
[182:01.84]Well, I tried.
[182:02.46]Happy birthday, Salai.
[182:03.44]Hopefully you had a good one.
[182:06.48]Do the stream again.
[182:09.26]Happy birthday to you.
[182:11.96]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $1.
[182:13.92]Waiting for six hours for my EU stream.
[182:16.69]Now it's 040 hours, but fuck it.
[182:19.51]I'll try and stay away for as long as I can.
[182:20.89]Glad to have you back.
[182:22.27]We've missed you.
[182:22.91]I'm sorry about that.
[182:23.87]I really thought this wasn't going to give me this much of a pain in the ass.
[182:28.41]I really thought I was going to be streaming at like 11 to 12 o'clock today.
[182:34.60]I do apologize for potentially making people wait around.
[182:39.22]Because that, like, sucks.
[182:41.64]Sorry, guys.
[182:43.90]You have no idea the rage.
[182:46.02]I went upstairs at one point to grab the orange juice.
[182:49.19]And I remember just, I was sitting on the couch.
[182:51.33]And I was just going like, fuck.
[182:53.87]What the, this is so stupid.
[182:57.67]I was just squeezing oranges in both hands.
[183:01.06]It's good stress relief.
[183:01.84]Just pay a whole load of glasses and then drink them.
[183:04.60]Uh, but, yeah.
[183:08.40]Uh, hopefully it was worth watching.
[183:10.68]And I gotta stop saying, uh, in between these, you know.
[183:13.08]Uh, and uh, you know.
[183:14.41]Uh, uh, I don't do uh.
[183:16.63]Why am I doing uh today?
[183:17.61]I don't do uh.
[183:19.41]Uh.
[183:20.31]And uh, the thing, uh, I don't do that.
[183:22.25]It's only today.
[183:23.95]Wake up!
[183:25.85]Super seal, thanks for the five dollars.
[183:27.98]Thick.
[183:30.80]Recently, maybe.
[183:32.82]Command Rabbit, thanks for the $1.
[183:34.00]What a great gift you're giving us for your comeback.
[183:35.84]That is this stream.
[183:37.84]Hopefully you enjoyed it.
[183:39.86]There's much more to see.
[183:42.30]Maybe we can get some better capturing tomorrow.
[183:46.55]Polo Juice, again, thanks for the $100 you gave earlier.
[183:49.35]That's a lot of money to give.
[183:53.67]Thank you, dude.
[183:54.25]Thank you so much.
[183:56.21]Polo Juice.
[183:58.95]Niall Aureon, thanks for the $1.
[184:00.61]Turn it up so your neighbors can guest star in the stream.
[184:06.26]So I can have somebody come over here and, like, can you turn the noise down?
[184:14.28]Nah, it's fine.
[184:15.40]I'm far enough away from any neighbors.
[184:18.36]I live in a goddamn gated community, okay?
[184:21.54]It's me, and that's it.
[184:24.38]And I got one of those big gates.
[184:26.26]I got two security officers that stand out there and they have the big bar that lifts anything, you know, for people to come in.
[184:31.09]You have to do the intercom.
[184:33.99]You go, it's upstairs.
[184:37.09]And I look at, I got like 90 security cameras and I see who you are.
[184:40.21]I'm like, who the fuck is it?
[184:41.73]And I relay down to one of the two security officers.
[184:44.77]They'll, you know, open up the gate and let them in.
[184:50.27]That's not a community.
[184:52.27]It's me.
[184:53.45]It's my community.
[184:54.43]How do you know that?
[184:55.51]How do you know there's not like 40 people that live in this house?
[184:59.92]Like it's my giant super mansion that's a theme park and a house together.
[185:05.88]But there's potentially 150 people that live here.
[185:07.90]How do you know that?
[185:10.24]Thank you Topek for the 10 bucks.
[185:14.27]Use the gun to end the strength.

[186:18.48]Topac, thank you for the 10 bucks again here.
[186:20.68]Remote taller than streamer.
[186:24.06]No.
[186:26.06]Look, anything that's on camera is so deceivingly small.
[186:31.21]Videotape your 75 inch TV.
[186:34.59]Okay?
[186:35.69]And then go look at that footage.
[186:36.95]Your TV is going to look kind of small.
[186:42.69]Delete this idiot.
[186:45.91]This TV's gigantic.
[186:47.68]It's so large.
[186:50.88]It was a miracle that this could be brought into the house and brought down here.
[186:54.52]Miracle.
[186:57.16]Thank you, though.
[186:58.30]Thank you, SmishySmash, for the $2.
[186:59.48]This is the kind of content I like to see.
[187:02.65]Well, I'm glad that you enjoyed it.
[187:05.47]Thank you so much for the $2, dude.
[187:08.80]Not dead mod Kyle.
[187:10.18]Thanks to the $1.50.
[187:11.52]Hello Germany.
[187:12.06]You probably noticed my name.
[187:13.81]It's a funny story behind that Last stream in an effort to be funny.
[187:17.75]I changed my name to what it is now I had mentored meant for it to be a 10-minute joke max Unfortunately, I didn't know about the 60-day cooldown period so now because of my ignorance and your kill the meme stream I'm stuck as Kyle for two months Well first thanks for the dollar fifty
[187:39.51]And sorry you're stuck with this name.
[187:40.91]Because now you have this name for a while.
[187:43.67]Might as well keep it at that point.
[187:45.67]Two months is 40 years on the internet.
[187:50.12]That is just your name now.
[187:53.10]Ivory, thanks for the three bucks.
[187:54.18]Hey Jerma, welcome back from your trip with your family.
[187:56.78]Even though it's been one week since you streamed, I'm happy to hear everything has gone well.
[188:00.68]Quick question, as you were that kid with the power glove in the arcades, can you confirm if people who watched you could place quarters
[188:08.66]on your screen to encourage you to play more I've only seen it in movies and shows but not sure if that ever happened um I hated the power glove I like despised that thing they marketed that thing as a way to use it to play race car games why would you ever do that that's so bad
[188:34.50]You'd put your hand out and turn your fist left and right to drive.
[188:37.86]Nobody drives with one hand.
[188:40.52]You'd drive a car with, maybe with two power gloves.
[188:43.85]And you could hold both hands out and turn the wheel.
[188:47.91]What a disaster of a product.
[188:50.85]Shove it up Rob's ass, Nintendo.
[188:52.70]Seriously.
[188:57.31]Johnny Geek, thanks for the $2.50.
[188:58.29]Thank you so much for all the laughs throughout the years.
[189:02.53]Hope you have just as much fun and more in the future.

[189:43.95]We're still going to be playing light gun games.
[189:46.97]I'll be playing like the point blank 30.
[189:50.69]But good luck to you.
[189:51.93]Take care.
[189:52.69]Thank you so much for even watching in the first place.
[189:56.47]Much love to you, dude.

[190:06.58]Still doesn't own a Vive.
[190:10.08]How do you know that?
[190:12.00]How do you know I couldn't just turn on the webcam right now and prove that I own a Vive?
[190:15.76]Huh?
[190:18.06]Didn't think I would be able to turn on the fucking webcam and prove to you that I have a Vive, did you?
[190:23.71]You didn't think that that was going to happen, did you?
[190:26.35]Hmm.
[190:27.03]Oh, what's that?
[190:29.47]There it is.
[190:32.35]Uh-huh.
[190:34.31]Here is the cord that goes with it.
[190:40.47]Don't pull this down.
[190:44.84]There's the cord that goes with it.
[190:46.10]That plugs into here, and then this.
[190:48.80]Alright, that's all.
[190:50.06]Give us a demonstration.
[190:51.92]God, people are fucking, just every time.
[190:54.70]So what you do, you open up this.
[190:56.81]This is where your eyes go.
[190:59.09]Like this.
[191:03.59]So then it's kind of tricky to put on.
[191:06.09]Once that's on, see the two eyes here?
[191:11.61]It actually works pretty well.
[191:13.43]I don't want to fuck with it yet, you know?
[191:16.32]I'd rather make sure it's...
[191:21.32]All the connections are made and it's calibrated and I don't want to... Oh, by the way, I'm kneeling.
[191:29.33]Please.
[191:29.83]I'm like kneeling down.
[191:32.59]Look at this.
[191:33.59]I'm like hunched down like this, kneeling.
[191:37.19]And I just... My ass is probably sweating.
[191:39.85]Just get off the fucking screen.
[191:44.15]Please don't tell me you just saw, like, a run down my fucking underwear.
[191:48.46]No, not my underwear.
[191:49.30]My pants.
[191:50.20]They would not be a run down my underwear.
[191:52.44]Ay-yi-yi.
[191:54.88]Like a fucking sweat line.
[191:59.50]It's been a rough night.
[192:02.61]I showered in these pants.
[192:05.21]Uh, thank you.

[192:42.36]Recommend it.
[192:44.48]Thank you, Bug Pal, for the five bucks.
[192:47.60]Mr. Destructoid, this feels like I'm eight years old in the arcade watching my older brother play this and our mom is about to come yell at him for exposing eight-year-old me to violence.
[192:59.47]Nobody can be angry at point blank.
[193:02.85]Point Blank is a... You're like shooting paper.
[193:07.91]It's the equivalent of shooting a piece of glass.
[193:14.71]No parent can be angry at Point Blank.
[193:19.61]It's pretty much the equivalent of violence in Sesame Street.
[193:25.23]You know what I mean?
[193:26.11]Sometimes Snuffleupagus turns around and knocks into the trash can or knocks into Big Bird's face.
[193:31.66]It's comic mischief.
[193:33.20]It's not like, it's comic mischief.
[193:36.80]My parents would be.
[193:40.80]What shampoo and conditioner do I use?
[193:43.57]It's a secret.
[193:46.09]But thank you all for the $1.
[193:49.71]They called me Taziki.
[193:51.39]They called me a Taziki-ku streamer.
[193:54.76]What is it?
[193:55.66]Taziki is a dipping sauce.
[193:57.92]Why are you calling me that?
[193:58.86]What happened?
[194:00.38]Stix Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[194:01.28]Hey Gerber, there are apparently rooms you can add to Twitch chat.
[194:04.90]Make a dead meme room to curb the rule breakers.
[194:07.27]Let's look into that.
[194:10.87]I might have to look into that one.
[194:14.09]Edgemont, thanks again for the $50 earlier with your Chuck E. Cheese comment.
[194:18.63]I wonder how Matt... Yeah, that's what sparked the... Talking about smashing golf clubs.

[194:29.84]Smelly boy, thanks for the $1.
[194:31.14]People are going to edit you shooting that gun into unsavory... Look, it's a fucking light gun.
[194:36.74]It's not real.
[194:39.99]Look, I told you.
[194:40.57]It's the equivalent of having a fun time at the arcade shooting clay discs.
[194:46.73]Okay?
[194:52.41]Lily P. Top, thanks for the $1.
[194:55.49]TV breaking joke win.
[194:57.19]I will never...
[194:59.35]Nope.
[195:00.59]You understand the catastrophe that's going to cause?
[195:05.45]If this TV ever fell down and smashed, we're talking about an actual dangerous situation.
[195:11.89]That's like a 500 pound TV.
[195:12.42]A tube TV.
[195:16.98]Those things, tube TVs, when they break, if they shatter, that, like, gas gets in the air.
[195:22.64]You don't want to breathe in, like, the tube TV gas.
[195:24.44]That's a dangerous, no.
[195:25.80]There's no joke there.
[195:27.61]If that thing falls, you knew it fell because I didn't plan that.
[195:33.57]There's, like, gas in those tubes.
[195:34.93]You don't want to fucking breathe it in.
[195:39.73]Thank you, Parsnips, for the $1.
[195:40.90]Do you use NVIDIA for those sick shots?
[195:43.18]Also, nice hair.

[195:47.76]Yes.
[195:49.14]Thank you, Jesus Prospect, for the $4.30.
[195:51.36]Jerma, I've never cheered to you, and I watch your old vids all the time.
[195:56.06]I still have inside jokes with my friend that you made in your videos.
[196:02.63]You helped me through hard times.
[196:04.23]Thanks for everything.
[196:06.87]Thank you, Jesus, for the $4.30.
[196:08.03]Welcome to the first ever cheer club.
[196:15.17]glad you can watch those old videos I still watch some of those old videos sometimes to get some nostalgia I laugh at like my old look I I open up my own videos and laugh at them what a narcissist no I'm just kidding I um from time to time somebody will bring up a part in the video or I want to relive it thank you Jesus
[196:41.70]Thank you Molotov bartender for the $1.
[196:43.90]Dab squid, dab for a squid.
[196:46.74]Nope, no, don't think so, but thank you.
[196:49.40]Dearly beloved, thanks for the five bucks.
[196:52.51]Hey Jerma, I know the stream was a pain in the ass to set up, but I really appreciate how much effort you put into your streams to make them unique and fun.
[196:59.13]Light gun games were always my absolute favorites growing up and it's been such a pleasure so far to watch you play them and kind of relive the games myself.
[197:06.13]Keep up the good work.
[197:07.63]Thank you dearly beloved for the $5.
[197:12.20]Yeah, I just figured... I mean, let's put it this way.
[197:16.39]I knew I wanted to go back and do a bunch of old games.
[197:19.89]And... If I have access to a PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 1 games and I can buy a bunch of shit on Amazon, there are a few local electronic stores, GameStops, random places that just have these old games.
[197:36.43]eBay...
[197:38.21]Why not play them and try to put them on stream if I have some access to them?
[197:43.08]So it's something I want to do for a long time and we're pulling the trigger on it now.
[197:49.12]We'll see how it goes, but I'm glad you can relive some of these games.
[197:52.36]There are plenty more on the way.
[197:55.80]Thanks so much.
[197:57.58]SuperSeal, thanks for the $1.
[197:58.96]I think the name Jex is very Jexy.
[198:04.64]Yeah, Officer Jex is on fucking duty.
[198:07.38]Keep your nose clean.
[198:10.08]Nightfang, thanks for the $1.
[198:11.40]Get a haircut, Gerber.
[198:12.12]You're starting to look like Mr. Wink from Mr. Weedy.
[198:15.16]Mr. Meedy.
[198:17.44]I don't know who that is.
[198:19.82]I've wanted to get a haircut for a long time, I promise.
[198:22.38]I just can't.
[198:23.06]I can't go sit in the chair.
[198:26.46]I don't want to go sit.
[198:27.38]I'm like a nine-year-old.
[198:28.86]I don't want to go get a haircut.
[198:30.34]I don't want to.
[198:32.86]I will eventually.
[198:35.54]Thank you Molotov Bartender for the 25 cents.
[198:37.44]When's the gun cam?
[198:39.14]I would have set that up if I wasn't so in a total rage trying to get all this other shit going tonight.
[198:45.46]Maybe we'll try that over the next week or so.
[198:49.14]SawedOffLaser, thanks for the $10.
[198:50.70]Been a fan for years.
[198:51.56]Finally get to pay it back.
[198:52.64]Cheers, Jerma.
[198:53.26]Keep up the awesome work.
[198:55.42]Thank you, SawedOffLaser, for your $10,000 bits.
[199:01.41]Every time I hear that somebody's been watching for years, it just makes me feel good.
[199:07.33]Because that means that you've literally, you are, you've been around for enough time where you just get it.
[199:18.00]You know what I mean?
[199:18.60]You guys just get it.
[199:20.30]If you've been watching for like five years, you just get it.
[199:24.79]You know, we like get each other.
[199:28.87]That sounds like a little weird.
[199:31.17]You know, we click.
[199:32.85]We just get each other.
[199:33.65]But thank you, though.
[199:36.78]Hearing that just makes me happy.
[199:39.60]I'm surprised every time somebody tells me that they've been watching for that long.
[199:44.04]It's very humbling.
[199:45.00]Thank you, dude.
[199:48.20]TheCubeRight.
[199:50.10]Thank you, TheCubeRightBandit for the $0.25.

[200:00.43]Hey, Jerm, I've been a fan for a few years.
[200:02.59]Again, right?
[200:03.21]And now, just wanted to show my appreciation for the years of entertainment.
[200:05.77]Also, nice shooting there, Jax.
[200:10.02]Again, thank you so much for giving me money and watching me do things for years.
[200:18.92]I've only been watching for one year.
[200:21.26]Well, Pablo, it's not...
[200:23.87]It's not a competition to see, like, who's been watching the longest.
[200:28.63]I'm appreciative and honored that anybody will watch this stream for more than 10 minutes.
[200:34.14]You know what I mean?
[200:37.18]Thank you.
[200:38.76]Whether you've been here for 5 years, 10 years, well, like, it's been about 6 or 7, right?
[200:43.72]Or 2 weeks.
[200:46.17]I'm just glad that you can hang out here and we can have fun.
[200:49.21]That's all I fucking care about.
[200:53.58]So thank you.
[200:56.18]D Jack, thanks for 10 bucks.
[200:57.52]No, one dollar.
[200:58.36]No, one dollar.
[201:00.17]After watching you get all 21 of the fireworks in five seconds, me and your chat are proud to re-award you with your gamer license.
[201:06.27]It was revoked after you played Binding of Isaac, but with your recent excellency, you've earned this, Officer Jax.
[201:14.71]I got my license back, did I?
[201:19.26]I'll take it.
[201:20.36]I'll take my gamer license back.
[201:23.55]I'm telling you, the 21 fireworks is not easy to do that.
[201:28.75]That is incredibly difficult.
[201:30.29]I will gladly walk down the aisle again and get married to my gamer license.
[201:35.98]Thank you.
[201:38.60]You guys were all there for me, I know it.
[201:42.54]But thanks, Djack.
[201:44.62]Thank you to Bia345 for the $1.
[201:48.43]Have you ever considered dressing up as George Washington?
[201:52.13]Also, bring back Jex, you hack.
[201:58.52]I gotta get rid of this hair, like, as soon as possible.
[202:01.62]No more George Washington jokes.
[202:04.02]I'll actually look like a fucking human.
[202:09.00]Topac, again, thanks for $15.
[202:10.90]This is like the third large donation tonight.
[202:14.46]Thanks, Topac.

[202:25.43]Sure she will appreciate that.
[202:28.59]Thank you, Darkstar7000 for the $1.
[202:30.79]I super duper love you and respecting your elders is fucking rad.
[202:34.22]Hope your ma's doing fine.
[202:35.56]Thank you.
[202:36.68]She is.
[202:39.44]She's doing just fine.
[202:44.87]Appreciate the concern.
[202:46.49]Guys, thank you.
[202:49.75]Mostly lost.
[202:50.45]Hey, mostly lost.
[202:51.27]What's up, dude?
[202:52.07]Thanks for the $5.
[202:53.59]Buy her some chocolate, too, or whatever she's capable of eating.
[202:57.35]She actually just recently, maybe two days ago, like yesterday, was able to eat real food.
[203:04.92]She ate pizza.
[203:06.98]We got pizza.
[203:08.00]She's like, you know, I want pizza.
[203:09.66]I was like, alright, you got it, ma.
[203:13.80]I guess when you haven't been able to eat for four or five days in a row,
[203:18.50]Well, like when you really have like real solid food, food, food, you know what I'm saying?
[203:24.34]Pizza is a pretty good choice if you're starving and you're hungry and holy shit.
[203:28.86]I've been eating like pureed bananas for two days.
[203:34.92]She had pizza.
[203:35.58]It was a good pizza too.
[203:39.63]But thank you, Mostly Lost, for the five bucks.
[203:40.97]Appreciate it.
[203:42.19]So does she.
[203:44.27]Inun Porter, thanks for the 25 cents.
[203:48.29]And you say, here are the last bits I have.
[203:51.54]Heart.
[203:53.34]Thank you, Nunn.
[203:56.04]So much.
[203:56.38]Appreciate it.
[203:59.62]Giving me your last bits.
[204:00.84]It's incredibly nice of you.
[204:04.62]Darkstar7000, thanks for the $1.
[204:07.10]Jerma985, the only streamer who would rather spend $2,000 on buying every single Dreamcast game than spend a few hundred on a VR setup.
[204:16.48]But that's not even true.
[204:18.72]That's not true.
[204:19.62]Thank you, first of all, Darkstar.
[204:21.00]But let me rebuttal and let me get a little bit of defense here for myself.
[204:25.75]I bought a PS, I bought a, look.
[204:28.75]I bought a PSVR when they were $500, right?
[204:34.77]So I have to like get as much out of the PSVR as I can.
[204:37.96]All the PSVR exclusives that come out from time to time.
[204:42.04]I bought it at like the highest fucking possible price.
[204:46.30]A PSVR is like $200 now.
[204:51.34]So I had to get everything out of the PSVR, so now I wouldn't feel bad owning the PSVR and the Vive.
[205:00.36]That's two VR setups.
[205:03.13]And yeah, I know the PSVR is a piece of shit, and we all know that.
[205:09.20]That $140 game.
[205:10.42]Well, I bought... The reason why I have a PSVR and not a Vive is because a long time ago, like a year and a half ago, I saw that Resident Evil 7 was only going to be VR on the PSVR.
[205:24.65]It was going to be a six month or so limited exclusivity to the PSVR.
[205:30.35]I really wanted to stream.
[205:32.90]Resident Evil 7.
[205:34.26]And what's that?
[205:35.06]Holy shit.
[205:36.10]I can stream the whole game in VR and maybe that'll be fun.
[205:40.95]That's why I own it.
[205:41.83]I would never have bought the PSVR if that wasn't a caveat there.
[205:48.31]So that's my defense.
[205:50.95]I'm going to own a Vive.
[205:52.49]Don't worry.
[205:53.55]And we're going to play... There's so much backlog of Vive games.
[205:57.36]I'll play Accounting.
[205:58.84]They're like Rick and Morty games.
[205:59.96]Don't you want to be playing that game?
[206:00.84]Hey, that's on PSVR.
[206:03.53]Don't even need a Vive.
[206:04.71]What do I want a Vive for?
[206:07.31]Jibbait it.
[206:07.75]Why am I getting jibbaited?
[206:10.39]Was it really worth it for $500?
[206:12.03]No.
[206:13.09]But I did it anyways.
[206:16.43]It was worth it for the memes, but now you can sell it.
[206:18.81]That's true.
[206:21.15]But thank you.
[206:23.39]Thank you, Darkstar.
[206:25.54]Thank you, SmishySmash for the $1.
[206:27.28]Are you an only child?
[206:28.40]No.
[206:29.20]I have an older brother and an older sister.
[206:32.16]I'm the youngest.
[206:33.38]I'm the baby.
[206:35.28]Darkstar7000 thanks for the two bucks.
[206:36.95]They just say I. Not sure if that was a mistake.
[206:40.79]And it was.
[206:41.77]Because Darkstar7000 with a dollar, right after that, I messed up that last one.
[206:46.69]I was going to say I'm glad streaming is your focus now.
[206:48.91]It seriously has helped me stay sane while taking a 5 to 7.50 p.m.
[206:54.50]chem course.
[206:56.14]Hope you aren't tired of hearing this, but I love you very much.
[207:01.39]I mean, honestly, it's hard to get tired of that.
[207:07.79]I wish I could say, you know, get real.
[207:11.62]No, I don't wish I could say this.
[207:12.86]Let me rephrase this.
[207:15.34]It's not like you're ever going to hear me be like, you know, thanks for all the love and respect.
[207:20.74]Get real sick of that shit, man.
[207:22.46]Can you just stop telling me that?
[207:25.56]It feels nice when people say these things.
[207:32.34]It inflates my ego.
[207:34.10]But then I do something real stupid, even off stream, and I come right back down to planet Earth.
[207:40.95]You know what I mean?
[207:42.67]Like, oh, Jerma, I love you very much.
[207:45.11]You're so awesome.
[207:45.77]These streams are great.
[207:46.89]That's right.
[207:47.77]That's right.
[207:48.55]I'm fucking great, aren't I?
[207:50.25]And then I turn the stream off and I'm like walking tall with my chest out.
[207:54.36]And then I forgot to pay my electric bill.
[207:57.44]And I'm like, fuck!
[207:59.72]I'm an idiot!
[208:01.00]What a stupid idiot!
[208:02.25]And I come right back down to Earth.
[208:10.81]No, but in reality, it means a lot.
[208:14.27]I wish there was more I could say besides... You guys are fucking awesome.
[208:22.95]I could not ask for something more than what you guys have given me over the last six plus years.
[208:28.61]I could not ask for more.
[208:32.18]You guys have given me so much, so fucking much, monetarily and in life.
[208:40.62]I could never ask for more, so thank you.
[208:44.86]Thank you to Casey for the five bucks.
[208:48.08]Jerma, you're a damn fine cop, but you're a Loose Cannon.
[208:51.21]We can't have somebody so reckless on the force hand over your badge and your gun.
[208:58.22]Fine.
[208:59.72]Just you know I'm going to get that guy on my own like in every fucking movie.
[209:04.32]I'll just let you know I'm going to put my badge and my gun on the table which doesn't ever mean anything.
[209:10.58]Why are they not watching that guy?
[209:12.88]After that person has to hand over their badge and gun, where's the surveillance to make sure that I'm not going to do something insane, right?
[209:21.69]Am I just supposed to, does the police chief just take at face value that Bruce Willis isn't going to immediately leave the fucking office and go do what he just said he wasn't going to do?
[209:33.66]Have somebody follow him.
[209:34.70]It's not that hard.
[209:38.17]And just, right when he gets out of the car to go to where he's not supposed to be, like get out of the car and be like, Bruce, Bruce, you're not supposed to be doing this.
[209:47.21]Go home.
[209:49.10]And then he's like, gosh, shit.
[209:52.38]And he gets in the car and he goes home.
[209:53.44]And the rest of the movie is him eating ramen noodles out of a sock.
[209:57.88]I'd watch it.
[210:01.28]Thank you, though.
[210:03.33]Thank you to Peaceful Haley for the $1.
[210:05.97]So I haven't watched you in about two months.
[210:08.51]And then today when I came back, you never cut your hair.
[210:11.11]And it's so long.
[210:12.03]So I wonder if I stop watching for another two months, how long is your hair going to be?
[210:17.84]No, this week, this hair is all getting cut off.
[210:22.62]I'm going to turn it into a mohawk.
[210:25.44]Thank you, Peaceful Haley.
[210:27.36]And Trina, thanks for the $1.
[210:28.52]I mean, he was only like three foot tall.
[210:29.92]It was pretty easy.
[210:32.06]What?
[210:32.26]I don't know what you mean.
[210:34.24]But Goop Snatch, thanks for the $1.50.
[210:36.08]Your name is gross.
[210:39.64]It is.
[210:40.18]Like that's, what is that?
[210:42.08]Goop Snatch?
[210:44.89]That's such a great, disgusting name.
[210:46.97]I love it.
[210:47.91]Like, ugh.
[210:50.73]Thanks.
[210:51.71]Prove it.
[210:53.41]Prove that you live in a private mansion guarded by a security team of 40.
[211:01.42]I don't have to do anything.
[211:02.88]These accusations are baseless, and I don't need to say... If I had to say anything to everybody that accused me of being a liar...
[211:13.00]I would be at my full-time job.
[211:15.60]I don't have to prove anything.
[211:17.90]That is from The Darkest Hour.
[211:20.16]Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill talking to a room full of people about how he doesn't have to prove that he lives in a mansion with 40 guards.
[211:30.00]Thank you to Antrita again for the two bucks.
[211:34.41]The guy in the window wasn't part of the joke.
[211:39.19]uh don't scare me like that me no but like but hold up let's but don't scare me like that comma like you you know what I mean you know like the me was not you know what I'm saying that was like oh no my goodness no that's not wasn't me saying that you know you don't understand thanks for the mostly lost thanks for the two bucks Jerma from one adhd person to another how do you get out of your comfort zone
[212:07.98]by buying or by getting a 45 inch TV, painfully bringing this 400 pound piece of gigantic cement filled trash down the stairs, lifting it up and hurting my back, asking my girlfriend who is a five foot tall, hundred and like 10 pound girl to help me do this.
[212:33.49]That's how, that's how I get out of my comfort zone.
[212:39.26]Poor Kim.
[212:39.72]I was like, hey, can you help me, like, lift a 400-pound TV?
[212:44.12]She's like, uh, what?
[212:47.32]Thank you.
[212:49.10]Thank you for the two bucks, though, man.
[212:51.38]But honestly, just do shit that you don't do every day.
[212:54.29]Try something new every day.
[212:56.07]Or at least once a week.
[212:56.89]Every day can be, like, that gets expensive.
[212:58.71]Don't try something new every day.
[213:00.87]A lot of people will give you this advice, like, oh, do something different and crazy and fun every day.
[213:06.15]No, do something maybe, like, once a week.
[213:08.85]Don't go crazy.
[213:09.59]Life is expensive.
[213:12.95]Just take care of yourself, you know?
[213:16.29]Machete Mario, thanks for the $1.50.
[213:17.90]That's a nice ass you have.
[213:20.20]Thanks.
[213:21.68]Snooze and Copter, thanks for the $1.00.
[213:24.58]Can you say and take care of everybody at the end of the stream just for, like, old time's sake?
[213:28.30]You don't have to, though.
[213:29.87]I listened to your old outro song.
[213:31.93]Bloom Bombs recently just threw me back.

[214:08.88]Just a couple more here.
[214:09.76]Thank you, Rainy David, for the $4.
[214:11.22]They just say cheer $400.
[214:13.98]Thank you, Rainy David.
[214:16.36]It's going to be a real snowy David here in about two hours.
[214:20.86]I think we're supposed to get a lot of snow tonight.
[214:22.74]It's going to be interesting.
[214:26.46]Thank you, though, Rainy David.
[214:28.64]Make01, thanks for the $5.

[214:32.22]Appreciate that.
[214:32.80]Thank you, Make.
[214:35.15]She's doing well.
[214:36.29]She's recovering.
[214:37.76]Probably going to be going over there tomorrow.
[214:39.28]So, like I said, before the stream gets turned off, expect over the next four or five days more erratic streams where there might not be one tomorrow.
[214:49.40]I'm going to try, but it might be Monday, Wednesday, Saturday.
[214:53.46]It's going to be weird over the next week.
[214:56.18]I'm going to try to get as many on the schedule as I can, but if not, then you'll see me soon.
[215:02.36]Don't worry.
[215:02.77]I'm not going to disappear.
[215:04.76]But thank you, Mick.
[215:05.38]I appreciate that.
[215:06.66]And then Flabjackbubby thanks for the $1.
[215:09.08]Are you going to be playing Kingdom Come Deliverance?
[215:11.14]Yes.
[215:12.24]Also, I'm a startup developer and looking for a voice actor.
[215:14.42]Are you still doing that kind of stuff?
[215:17.19]Not so much anymore.
[215:18.47]I'm kind of focusing on a few other things.
[215:21.03]There's a couple other projects that I'm trying to focus on besides streaming.
[215:24.79]And they're kind of taking up any other time I would have had.
[215:33.15]But thank you for the $1.
[215:35.82]Yes, I'm going to be playing Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[215:38.78]I've heard it is a very, very interesting video game.
[215:42.94]We'll throw that in here over the next week.
[215:45.37]Maybe the next couple weeks.
[215:47.37]But yes.
[215:50.13]Was it from you?
[215:51.05]What is it?
[215:51.93]From you or not?
[215:53.28]What is what from me?
[215:53.86]What are you talking about?
[215:59.41]Jerma Knight?
[216:00.02]God, I sound like a prick.
[216:01.16]Why?
[216:01.52]What?
[216:02.22]Why do you sound like a prick?
[216:05.34]Thank you.
[216:05.66]Mostly loss at the very end.
[216:06.72]We're the subbies, damn it.
[216:07.78]Get it right.
[216:08.20]That's right.
[216:08.76]Oh, man.
[216:09.42]I forgot about that.
[216:10.84]Thank you for just reminding me.
[216:14.17]And that's it, guys.
[216:16.11]If you don't see anything tomorrow around like 5, 6, 7 o'clock, then expect me the next day.
[216:23.13]I'm going to try to be as... It's going to be jumbled, but we've got way more light gun stuff to do.
[216:27.94]It should be fun.
[216:30.23]And I'll see you guys next time.
[216:33.01]Thank you for bearing with me today.
[216:34.51]I'm sorry that I was supposed to stream like seven fucking hours ago.
[216:39.07]But it didn't happen.
[216:42.16]Take care, everybody.
[216:43.50]Thank you.
[216:44.88]And good night.
[217:24.01]Thank you.
[217:58.88]Thank you.
