[00:06.67]Hello.
[00:07.21]Should I leave the title as Buying and Selling Organs?
[00:09.69]I feel like that's kind of morbid for the next game we're playing.
[00:22.54]What are they doing?
[00:24.76]What is the chat doing right now?
[00:28.78]What's the meaning of this?
[00:38.40]I broke the chat?
[00:40.82]What did I do?
[00:45.14]Why are you revolting against me?
[00:46.70]What are you doing?
[00:47.12]Put us back in emote only mode.
[00:52.66]I will.
[00:52.96]Now I'm going to drop this volume a little bit.
[01:03.57]What's this bit that they're doing?
[01:06.23]What little routine is this?
[01:17.20]Let me capture this game.
[01:18.70]Okay.
[01:28.77]What do they add?
[01:31.65]Is it actually a big substantial update?
[01:33.03]That's pretty cool.
[01:34.33]I love this game too.
[01:38.87]Video quality.
[01:41.25]Supercomputer.
[01:44.75]Looks fine.
[01:45.59]Mouth sensitivity.
[01:46.23]Bring that down.
[01:48.84]Leaderboards?
[01:49.32]I don't need leaderboards.
[01:50.14]Who cares?
[01:52.74]Do 90 FOV.
[01:56.04]I do need to do this.
[01:57.58]I remember the sound effects were very loud.
[01:59.37]Turn that up.
[02:10.35]Okay.
[02:11.09]Go back to the organ game.
[02:12.91]Don't make me scream into my monitor.
[02:14.15]I really will.
[02:17.14]Okay.
[02:17.52]So...
[02:19.64]I think I'm just going to do the... sort of birthday mode.
[02:22.88]Because I just want to play the new stuff.
[02:24.22]Survival takes a little too long, I think.
[02:25.50]Quick play.
[02:28.20]Oh, shit.
[02:28.56]That's cool.
[02:32.42]Let's just do birthday mode.
[02:38.78]Go back to the Oregon game.
[02:40.88]You guys... You guys... Stop being such buttheads, okay?
[02:47.34]You guys are being buttheads.
[02:53.20]I'm gonna tell mom.
[02:54.30]This is like the untelling mom.
[02:56.14]You're like holding your finger and putting it in my face.
[02:57.99]Like, I'm not touching you.
[02:58.77]I'm not touching you.
[02:59.35]I'm about to yell for mom.
[03:11.41]Alright, here we go.
[03:14.33]So what's the additions?
[03:20.74]Uh, which arcade should I go to?
[03:26.83]Did I shoot myself in the head?
[03:28.45]I thought it was... What do you mean, new text message?
[03:34.37]Happy birthday, kid.
[03:35.17]Alright, I got 200 bucks.
[03:37.59]The bullet went backwards.
[03:40.39]Go to the... Please don't listen to chat.
[03:45.38]Don't change the title.
[03:48.08]One-Eyed Billy's.
[03:48.74]Oh, okay.
[03:49.00]I forget what One-Eyed Billy's is.
[03:54.57]Barry's Pawn Shop, Larry's Arcade.
[03:56.83]Isn't it down on the coast somewhere?
[03:58.49]We'll find it.
[04:01.07]This is very loud.
[04:09.20]This is exactly what I was talking about.
[04:16.00]Outside of this arcade looks like a strip club.
[04:18.98]Stuff.
[04:25.53]I do appreciate the GPS that's here, though.
[04:32.55]Alright, one-eyed.
[04:37.73]Aww.
[04:37.89]Okay.
[04:40.15]Don't hit me again, please.
[04:41.41]Okay.
[04:43.45]Stuff it.
[04:51.55]Where is one-eyed, at least?
[04:54.43]Did they add another arcade or did they add more machines?
[04:56.69]Oh, One Eye Blaze is this way.
[05:03.50]Oh my god, dude.
[05:04.46]There's a whole new arcade?
[05:16.83]What?
[05:20.44]Holy shit, dude, you wouldn't believe it.
[05:21.42]The Oregon game just got a huge update.
[05:23.02]You should check it out.
[05:25.26]You dick.
[05:30.22]How do I reliably get over there?
[05:45.33]I guess I have to run.
[05:47.93]Jeremy, your stream gave me acne.
[05:53.38]I didn't do anything.
[06:05.19]Eating animals, that doesn't work right now.
[06:06.83]Alright, one of my abilities is right here.
[06:14.07]Let's go check it out.
[06:15.66]I'm actually very interested.
[06:26.30]By the way, I'm just realizing, aren't I like 13 or something?
[06:29.92]I feel like this would be incredible.
[06:33.18]Where are my parents?
[06:33.84]This would be really dangerous.
[06:34.85]Alright, one-eyed billies.
[06:49.37]Adventure and fun center.
[06:54.36]celtics lost I have not seen a celtics player shoot a basket in probably like 11 years I have not watched a single game I'm sorry alright should we get pizza 24 hour delivery earn money today pirate pizza wait what deliver pirate pizzas click here to accept a delivery
[07:26.24]Fried baked pizzas.
[07:28.24]Pizza delivery, $7.
[07:29.02]Wait, did I just buy a pizza?
[07:34.90]Why am I purchasing this?
[07:38.46]What?
[07:39.50]Why did I have to buy this?
[07:41.47]Who am I delivering this to?
[07:44.33]Who is supposed to be getting this?
[07:46.81]Oh my fucking god.
[07:48.01]Where's my car?
[07:53.17]Where's my car?
[07:54.43]Where's the car?
[07:58.72]Did you expect it for free?
[07:59.96]I don't expect to pay for a customer's order and then bring it to them.
[08:04.10]The customer pays for it and then I get paid to bring it.
[08:11.99]Why do I have to pay for the customer's food?
[08:13.43]How come the sound just got removed?
[08:21.93]Can I just run there?
[08:22.68]I definitely can run there.
[08:31.43]out your window.
[08:32.03]It's like you order like Uber Eats or something and you look out your window and there's a guy just fucking sprinting down your street with a bag of food in his hand.
[08:47.08]He's in full stride.
[08:50.66]And he still comes up as a car on the app when you look at the app and you know you can see where the car is going.
[08:58.57]Where am I?
[09:01.63]Where am I?
[09:05.96]Where am I?
[09:09.50]Where am I?
[09:12.08]Where am I?
[09:15.76]I don't know.
[09:16.34]What am I?
[09:17.12]Where am I?
[09:18.50]I'm the red?
[09:19.12]Is this their house?
[09:28.71]Oh, pizza.
[09:29.17]Pizza.
[09:37.16]How do I get my inventory?
[09:42.35]No, wait, hey!
[09:43.63]No, don't call my limo!
[09:45.35]What are you doing?
[09:47.01]Where am I?
[09:47.65]Did I just... No, I don't care.
[09:50.25]I don't... I want to go back to deliver that pizza.
[09:53.05]No, I need to... Can you take me to the place I just was?
[09:54.97]I need to go back and deliver that pizza.
[09:59.08]I need to... My limo... Can I take the... Where am I?
[10:02.06]No, wait!
[10:05.64]Oh, for the love of God.
[10:07.04]Okay, hold on.
[10:07.42]Wait, wait, wait.
[10:08.02]I have a car.
[10:12.26]Don't I have a bike?
[10:13.53]Don't I have something to... I don't have a car or anything.
[10:17.67]Okay, this way.
[10:27.17]Oh, it looks like my Uber Eats driver is right down the street.
[10:31.89]Let me open up the blinds and see.
[10:34.52]He's sprinting down the street.
[10:36.04]He's got a bag in his hand.
[10:38.46]He's here!
[10:39.10]Oh, he just got hit by a car.
[10:42.18]I hope he's okay.
[10:44.70]Oh, a limo just pulled up.
[10:46.20]He's standing outside the door.
[10:47.23]He just got in the limo.
[10:50.99]He left.
[10:53.53]He's back.
[10:53.91]Running.
[10:54.71]Running.
[11:03.38]Okay, straight.
[11:08.54]Do I have a flashlight?
[11:09.66]I thought I did.
[11:10.82]I do.
[11:11.02]You're not going to make it?
[11:15.22]Yes, I have 124 seconds.
[11:16.86]I'm running 125 miles per hour.
[11:18.68]I'll be okay.
[11:25.39]Which house is it?
[11:26.19]It's this one right here.
[11:28.21]But where's my inventory?
[11:30.45]I... I haven't played this in a long time.
[11:35.65]I have my credit card.
[11:40.33]K is inventory.
[11:41.13]I don't think so.
[11:45.43]It's on the watch.
[11:51.30]Is it tab?
[11:52.08]Alright, where the hell is this place?
[11:55.28]It's right ahead.
[11:56.50]It's not this building.
[12:01.74]It's the building right in front of me.
[12:04.96]I need to take it out.
[12:06.28]Golf cart, beach, billies, warehouse, factory.
[12:10.54]There it is.
[12:18.43]Which house is it?
[12:23.35]Is this place?
[12:23.89]Okay, it's right here.
[12:31.07]Where?
[12:31.59]Where is it?
[12:35.52]Right here?
[12:38.08]Oh, God.
[12:45.67]This one?
[12:49.75]Where is this house?
[12:51.37]What's happening?
[12:52.05]Is this house right here?
[12:53.07]A dollar tip.
[13:00.77]And he slammed...
[13:09.24]I actually just got one dollar tip.
[13:14.74]Okay.
[13:15.54]Where's my limo?
[13:27.27]Get in here.
[13:30.63]Let me in my car.
[13:35.61]Why can I not get in here?
[13:40.89]I locked myself out of my own car.
[13:49.47]I can't take this off.
[13:53.10]Put the card in the slot.
[13:55.56]Oh my god.
[13:56.28]Can I go to, um, One-Eyed Billy's already?
[14:16.06]Not impounded, it's fine.
[14:18.56]Drive your car up here.
[14:25.08]It's not even that steep.
[14:26.78]Please.
[14:32.04]Remember, you should play at least the painful.
[14:33.70]There's an arcade machine here.
[14:35.46]At least the painful.
[14:42.85]Alright, finally.
[14:45.49]Let's play some of the new games.
[14:47.21]Very excited.
[14:53.19]There are no brakes.
[14:53.73]I don't have brakes.
[14:54.39]I don't have brakes.
[15:03.87]Randomizing the play tables in coin.
[15:05.40]What do you mean play tables?
[15:09.62]You said there was a new boat ride to take, which we'll do.
[15:12.98]That sounds like fun.
[15:16.55]Oh, I wanna do this.
[15:17.13]This is fun.
[15:19.52]High score is 175.
[15:20.54]I think I've done this already, but I love this game.
[15:48.05]I can't do it.
[15:48.45]My AD is just freaking out.
[15:51.21]Remember I told you guys I can't trace anything?
[15:53.37]I also can't do this either.
[15:54.37]It makes me, like, want to puke.
[15:57.42]Oh, I did it.
[16:03.96]Ooh.
[16:05.26]You play against another person?
[16:07.64]What's happening?
[16:08.37]Why am I getting attacked?
[16:12.01]What was that?
[16:18.20]Who just did that?
[16:28.52]I'm gonna fuck with me again.
[16:36.58]Oh, hoops.
[16:54.52]I gotta get it in the spot.
[16:57.90]A little higher.
[17:05.79]Come on.
[17:11.65]What's the point of a backboard?
[17:12.75]They always say aim for the backboard, but you never see NBA players do that.
[17:17.93]They always just swish it or dunk it.
[17:32.63]Mountain Dew.
[17:34.23]Not really Mountain Dew.
[17:35.05]Ooh, what's this one?
[17:39.43]You see these in like Dave and Buster sometimes and you always wonder, there's so much room.
[17:44.17]This is such a huge, gigantic machine.
[17:48.96]It's so unnecessary.
[17:53.36]And this is, by the way, this is one of the worst machines in the entire arcade.
[17:55.90]This thing sucks.
[17:57.14]Nobody likes playing this.
[17:59.52]I've never seen anybody have fun playing this game.
[18:04.26]They always, like, swipe their card, they press it once, and they go, oh, alright, this is, alright.
[18:08.54]What's over there?
[18:09.12]What's that over there?
[18:09.70]Is that, uh, Time Crisis?
[18:11.04]Nobody likes this game.
[18:17.57]And by the way, this game is always one of the most expensive ones in the entire casino.
[18:21.57]50 tickets, hell yeah.
[18:29.21]30 tickets.
[18:34.91]Hell yeah.
[18:39.36]In the middle.
[18:42.08]What'd I get?
[18:47.92]What was that?
[18:50.60]What?
[18:50.70]559.
[18:50.93]That got the jackpot?
[18:52.07]Oh my god.
[18:54.73]Fake.
[18:54.97]Come on, give me another one.
[19:06.80]This is roulette for children.
[19:13.63]How many balls do I get?
[19:14.57]Ah, tickets.
[19:18.87]Awesome.
[19:19.11]Yeah, I'll do it again.
[19:26.03]Say how much this sucks again?
[19:27.17]I think I just did it again.
[19:32.09]Holy shit.
[19:33.77]Alright.
[19:35.51]I'm getting really lucky.
[19:44.38]Is he going to... Mystery.
[19:49.48]What's a mystery?
[19:54.53]Wow, that's a lot.
[19:56.13]This is a really good return on my investment.
[20:01.93]Turn it up a little bit.
[20:02.41]It's kind of low.
[20:02.83]Can I do it again?
[20:10.55]What is wrong with me, by the way?
[20:17.56]Okay.
[20:29.52]Okay.
[20:33.00]I'm just gravitating towards this.
[20:37.57]This is all the little kids at the skee-ball machine.
[20:39.37]You just open up Chuck E. Cheese and it's just like... Oops.
[20:49.39]They just keep... Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[20:50.75]Play skee-ball, skee-ball, skee-ball, skee-ski-ski.
[20:55.97]I think I might... This might be broken.
[21:01.77]I'm not sure what to do about this.
[21:02.65]Can I take my tickets?
[21:09.09]I think I might as well leave and come back.
[21:18.40]alright well this one's broken just like at every fucking arcade I'm not let me tell you at every arcade I've ever been to it's always like one or two of these are just not working and they always have the best prizes in them is that some is that crazy conspiracy it's always the ones that are not on that have the best prizes inside
[21:48.00]This one's kind of cool.
[21:48.60]And what they should do is take the prizes out of the one that's broken and put it in the one you can actually use.
[21:59.04]There's a fidget spinner in here.
[22:07.07]Are these my tickets?
[22:19.01]Oh, those are 80 tickets.
[22:19.93]Alright.
[22:28.27]I want the fidget spinner.
[22:29.65]I'm going to get it.
[22:30.11]I like the golf balls.
[22:35.45]This is cool.
[22:35.93]Is that money?
[22:36.49]I don't think I can rotate it.
[22:45.53]Settle down.
[22:50.96]That was way off.
[22:52.16]I think I got it though.
[22:54.82]Oh, come on.
[22:55.34]Was it a razor?
[22:55.96]Do it again.
[23:01.76]What's the biggest prize I've ever won?
[23:09.40]Probably the flaming finger.
[23:17.35]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[23:19.15]The guy goes, flamed finger.
[23:20.77]Get your flame on.
[23:21.99]And you have to go like, with your finger.
[23:27.11]You have to trace inside the lines.
[23:29.97]I've beaten that one before and I got, I think, like a thousand tickets.
[23:32.72]Whatever the jackpot was, I actually beat it.
[23:38.24]I made this up.
[23:38.74]It's an actual game.
[23:42.06]Hold on.
[23:42.34]No, I'm not done.
[23:42.90]I want that.
[23:43.60]Whatever it is.
[23:48.91]There's a strategy with that, though, is you don't... You get friction if you use the pad of your finger.
[23:54.49]So you have to use almost like the top of your nail and the top part of your finger.
[23:59.41]So you use almost your fingernail and the small part of the pad of the top right where the fingernail reaches.
[24:06.11]Like right where your fingernail touches the pad of your finger.
[24:08.76]That's what you should be using to play Flaming Finger.
[24:10.54]Give me the money.
[24:23.02]Oh my goodness, come on.
[24:27.51]What is Flaming Finger?
[24:28.59]Flaming Finger is an arcade game.
[24:31.35]You have to trace inside of a gigantic maze in five seconds, the whole maze.
[24:40.42]Is that not in arcades anymore?
[24:43.82]I feel like I've seen it.
[24:50.82]Oh my goodness, please just give that to me.
[25:00.16]I need one of the fidget spinners.
[25:08.34]Why is it swaying so much?
[25:10.58]That's how they get you.
[25:11.36]Stop swaying.
[25:23.04]Give it to me.
[25:30.18]You're doing great.
[25:33.22]He doesn't have his makeup on.
[25:34.24]That's why the face cam isn't on.
[25:37.47]There, you got me.
[25:41.37]I don't want movement.
[25:42.23]Can I see?
[25:55.32]I can't see from the other side.
[25:59.65]Oh my god, stop moving around so much.
[26:05.79]All these golf balls are messing everything up.
[26:07.79]Just leave.
[26:09.09]I'll come back later.
[26:13.05]Just leave.
[26:13.33]I'm done.
[26:15.21]What's this one?
[26:16.29]Fishy, fishy.
[26:17.37]Ooh, this is cool.
[26:24.26]This definitely wasn't here last time.
[26:29.98]Another crane.
[26:32.32]I wonder how much this, you know.
[26:35.56]Let's see.
[26:36.48]I'm going for the flam.
[26:39.45]The shell.
[26:40.33]Whatever it is.
[26:40.75]Right in front.
[26:45.81]That one down right there.
[26:46.71]Grab it.
[26:49.39]Let's see it.
[26:49.79]First try.
[26:50.19]Come on.
[26:51.83]Got it.
[26:52.59]Hell yeah.
[26:56.53]Give me another one.
[27:02.56]I think I got this one.
[27:03.24]This one should be easy.
[27:06.88]Oh, yeah.
[27:07.56]If that grips... No, it's okay.
[27:13.79]Get the snail.
[27:15.91]I'll get it.
[27:17.57]How much is this worth?
[27:20.43]Probably sell that.
[27:25.10]I want to play the air hockey.
[27:26.36]Should I play against someone?
[27:32.45]Oh, okay.
[27:36.25]What the hell?
[27:36.97]What?
[27:37.45]Don't laugh at me.
[27:38.11]You guys have to understand the strategy with air hockey is you just stay completely still right in the middle and your friend will fuck everything up.
[27:56.20]You just don't have to move.
[27:57.00]They're going to try to be like, it's going to bounce all over the place.
[28:01.62]Well, this was an AI.
[28:04.70]Your goal is you want to go straight forward.
[28:06.66]Let your friend just do a bunch of crazy shit.
[28:08.26]They're going to screw up.
[28:08.86]Because they're always going to bounce to the edges.
[28:15.90]Just defend this middle part and you'll be completely fine.
[28:18.84]See what happened?
[28:21.12]Is a crowd forming?
[28:27.05]This like four or five inches right here is the only thing you should be concerned about at all.
[28:33.56]Just wait for your buddy to rear back and go SMASH!
[28:37.20]And then it bounces kink kink kink kink back and hits him in the fucking finger.
[28:40.48]And he's gonna go OH SHIT!
[28:42.40]And it's gonna be inside- it's- you don't have to do anything.
[28:57.99]Varying speeds too.
[29:00.89]That doesn't make any sense.
[29:01.93]This went right for my buddy.
[29:09.07]Doesn't make any sense either.
[29:10.15]Get over here.
[29:13.77]Somebody else.
[29:16.68]Or, you know what another strategy is?
[29:18.18]And I've used this before too.
[29:19.44]And it really, really pisses people off.
[29:21.96]Is you just go like this.
[29:26.26]You just go... Like that.
[29:33.12]I mean, it's going to make you sick if I keep doing it.
[29:34.86]But you get the idea.
[29:37.95]And then if they'll eventually score on themself.
[29:41.75]That's classic.
[29:52.11]Oh, yeah.
[29:53.09]Hold on.
[29:53.53]I am reaching that far?
[29:54.95]That seems like too far to reach.
[30:02.65]Oh, is it a yo-yo?
[30:18.69]I'm not doing the strategy and it's not working.
[30:20.59]That's a new game idea.
[30:27.86]That'd be really dangerous.
[30:28.72]I don't think that'd be safe.
[30:29.68]I don't know if it'd hurt.
[30:36.96]You know what I also think too?
[30:39.00]I also think that these paddles should be heavy.
[30:42.74]They should be weighted.
[30:44.36]And I'll tell you one reason why.
[30:46.80]The amount of people that get on these machines and act like absolute assholes and just swing as hard as they can and smash this shit across the arcade.
[30:56.06]If these things were like seven to, if they were like 10 pounds and you had to like drag them around and actually you couldn't like swing like crazy and knock it off the thing.
[31:09.99]And they should be attached.
[31:12.19]These should be attached to here.
[31:15.92]This should be on a track that's literally here.
[31:18.70]Like this.
[31:19.96]And it should weigh like fucking five pounds.
[31:32.95]just make it yeah and somebody is maybe two other people no wait I have to let me rephrase that it should be tethered to a wire or something that can only move like this far right so not like a track but on a tether so it can move like this right on a wire or whatever the tether it has to be on and it needs to weigh like at least a few pounds
[32:02.23]Are you losing to a little kid?
[32:04.11]I'm barely even playing the game.
[32:05.21]I'm explaining how to make this game better.
[32:06.61]I think I've mentioned this before, but, uh, you know, lying on top of one of these things, just letting the air hit every fucking pore of your body, that's, like, I, like, want that.
[32:19.34]I want a, um, air hockey table in my house not to play it.
[32:23.22]It would have to be a relaxation zone.
[32:27.88]Is that weird for me to say that?
[32:33.19]In the middle of like the hottest days of summer when it's 110, 115 plus degrees here.
[32:38.99]Lying on top of one of these and having hundreds of little air jets hit you in every corner of your body.
[32:47.28]I wouldn't even play this thing.
[33:01.77]And get one.
[33:03.39]Just take a shower.
[33:04.25]I don't want to get wet.
[33:15.26]Who's winning right now?
[33:16.18]I can't even tell.
[33:16.74]Is this supposed to be a little kid?
[33:22.52]Stop talking about your fetishes.
[33:40.29]That's very specific.
[33:44.17]Yeah, I see what happens as I get off to lying on my back on an air hockey table.
[33:48.35]I'm letting the air hit me in the back.
[33:52.35]Good luck finding pornography for that.
[33:54.06]There's probably three videos on the internet where that happens.
[33:58.86]You're gonna have to cycle between like two videos.
[34:19.53]You could just corner the market.
[34:27.20]I don't think there's a very large market for that.
[34:33.84]If you're talking about like a business expense for yourself, I'm not sure you would ever recoup the cost of the table.
[34:55.64]Does anybody else think this is getting a little ridiculous that this is still going?
[35:01.60]And I have to admit, this happens when I play regular ice hockey.
[35:05.34]Not ice hockey.
[35:06.56]Table hockey.
[35:07.24]Whatever the hell this is called.
[35:09.90]After about five minutes, neither person wants to play anymore, but nobody wants to back away because this was $4.
[35:15.65]I won.
[35:21.09]I just kicked his ass.
[35:26.81]That's pretty good tickets.
[35:34.03]I am not kidding.
[35:34.91]I have left games without being completed.
[35:37.23]There have been people waiting to play air hockey.
[35:41.87]Sort of another couple group or kids or something.
[35:45.49]And I've gotten like two to two.
[35:47.71]Like one to three or something versus somebody.
[35:50.31]And we just leave.
[35:52.63]Like, oh, that was fun.
[35:53.87]I know, you guys can just take it.
[35:58.28]I actually, in fact, will say I think air hockey is the worst thing that's in the arcades, because it takes up so much space, and I find it to be, after five minutes, a game I don't want to play anymore.
[36:10.17]Like, not even two minutes.
[36:23.39]I would rather there be... I want more games, like video games.
[36:29.16]And not just the same video game where they give you a machine gun, a plastic machine gun to fire at aliens.
[36:36.26]I'm sick of those too.
[36:37.56]Arcades nowadays have seriously become like 10 plastic machine gun shooters, 10 car games, and then a bunch of like coin pushers.
[36:56.19]Where's the Mortal Kombat?
[36:58.73]They tucked that shit in the corner.
[37:00.79]Where's Turtles in Time?
[37:01.93]They put that stuff in like the jokey retro section where there's three cabinets.
[37:05.73]They're covered in dust.
[37:08.37]Nobody plays them.
[37:15.93]Air hockey's a fun game.
[37:19.13]I don't know.
[37:20.05]I think it takes up too much space.
[37:30.61]Go to a retro arcade.
[37:31.73]Yeah, but those are so few and far between.
[37:44.64]I think it's fun, but please remove it from all arcades.
[37:46.64]I didn't say remove.
[37:47.76]I'm just talking about there's usually like four or five of them that take up a huge amount of real estate because you have to have a huge amount of real estate to put them down.
[38:01.08]And there are these things.
[38:01.80]Do you know how many Simpsons arcade games could fit just right here?
[38:11.41]Like eight.
[38:12.67]You could fit six arcade cabinets.
[38:14.95]One, two, three, four, five.
[38:16.43]Go.
[38:30.64]How am I supposed to get it down?
[38:32.96]All the golf balls are in the way.
[38:39.89]Haven Busters is all that we have.
[38:43.69]Yeah, I think that kind of... I don't know.
[38:48.39]Here's the weird thing about arcades nowadays.
[38:52.90]is all these companies bait everybody now with nostalgia yet no one will make an arcade that has the old games in it and then really have it be like a big business like they just pull on all of our nostalgia heartstrings but they won't put any of these like old cool arcade games even busters is just like the same this kind of everywhere
[39:23.24]There's, yeah, they exist, but it's maybe one in one.
[39:27.30]Every major city maybe has one.
[39:29.98]Maybe.
[39:33.80]Round one does do it.
[39:34.88]Round one does it to an extent.
[39:39.12]But I really do kind of miss just like the old just arcade games where you just, the cabinets.
[39:44.79]You just played a game and you had to put, you know, coins in for lives and stuff.
[39:49.11]I miss that.
[39:58.47]Arcades are the way to go.
[40:00.14]That's true.
[40:02.16]That's true.
[40:04.94]I'm just trying to get these golf balls out of the way.
[40:06.46]There's not a market for it anymore.
[40:10.80]Yeah, but that's my point, though.
[40:13.35]There's not a market for it anymore, yet they keep remaking video games and movies and stuff.
[40:19.99]I think there is.
[40:21.15]It's just nobody really wants to put the time and money into doing it.
[40:28.92]I so badly want this fidget spinner.
[40:37.27]Old arcade cabinets are hard to maintain.
[40:41.51]Yeah, I'm just a salty old person.
[40:50.83]I will get this before I turn the stream off.
[40:53.30]I promise.
[40:53.80]In fact, I'm getting it right now.
[40:59.06]Nope, I'm going too far up.
[41:03.46]Some anime conventions have big arcades.
[41:06.84]I remember, I think like some of the packs at some point had this old retro arcade room.
[41:13.89]It was awesome.
[41:16.47]It was like 50 cabinets old, like Donkey Kong, like Joust and all that stuff.
[41:20.73]It was so cool.
[41:21.27]I think that might be it.
[41:27.06]There it is.
[41:31.46]Hold on a little longer stuff swinging around so much.
[41:33.90]Yeah.
[41:36.22]Alright, let's go.
[41:40.19]Where is it?
[41:46.19]Um, where's my fidget spinner?
[41:52.27]It was just $5.
[41:52.85]Ooh, what's this?
[42:01.75]What is this?
[42:02.15]Time score?
[42:03.93]I have to shoot like a water cannon?
[42:06.39]This is cool.
[42:12.88]What boat am I?
[42:13.36]What am I supposed to do?
[42:21.28]Pick up the... Oh, okay.
[42:23.96]I have to pick these up.
[42:31.01]Oh boy, I have no idea where I am.
[42:36.92]Earn.
[42:41.60]I'm blue in the corner.
[42:47.15]This is cool.
[42:59.00]I love those old Midway games, too.
[43:01.04]We have to spray the water into the hole.
[43:03.16]If I was ever a billionaire, I would probably lose $50,000 a day on this project.
[43:15.36]I would love to just have a huge, awesome arcade that had so much of this stuff.
[43:19.68]All the old classics, just like 100-plus old retro arcade cabinets.
[43:25.28]All the old stuff that remembers.
[43:30.32]I would probably just lose money every day.
[43:42.71]I can't tell even what direction I am.
[43:44.35]Did I turn around?
[43:52.22]Rent out an arcade instead.
[43:57.86]Say, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[44:00.56]That was so fun, dude.
[44:05.98]Honestly, the way that that boat over on the left was, I thought it was Spongebob in the water.
[44:15.78]Vegas is probably the place to do that.
[44:19.34]That was cool.
[44:22.54]I got tickets for that?
[44:26.77]How do I get off?
[44:29.95]Oh.
[44:31.47]That's a lot.
[44:32.05]It's 600 tickets.
[44:33.31]I did that one.
[44:41.28]I got that one.
[44:41.80]I beat that one.
[44:47.52]Did I?
[44:48.34]Oh, there's mini golf.
[44:49.58]I don't think I did mini golf.
[44:50.55]Did I?
[44:52.11]Last time I played it?
[44:57.11]I've got to put all the new viewers, I've got to impress the hell out of them, right?
[45:01.68]How could I not impress the new viewers with this?
[45:05.70]Plus.
[45:08.48]I mean, I've got to show what I can do here.
[45:11.10]You know when I got this?
[45:21.81]What was it, like five or six times in a row?
[45:37.01]This was the Ayaya game.
[45:38.51]Yes, it was.
[45:43.55]I gotta get it twice in a row.
[45:52.20]Come on.
[45:57.00]Apologize.
[45:57.70]Apologize.
[45:58.20]Apologize.
[45:58.64]Apologize.
[46:01.16]I am so sorry.
[46:03.00]I am so sorry.
[46:05.24]It's two.
[46:06.18]Three in a row.
[46:10.21]What was this point?
[46:11.11]I just got distracted.
[46:14.01]Get out of here.
[46:20.24]Come on.
[46:23.20]Three times in a row.
[46:31.80]Ew.
[46:33.14]Oh, I forgot about this.
[46:34.12]You can just keep going.
[46:36.69]Why should I crash the whole game and just try to fill this entire arcade with tickets until everybody has to run out?
[46:47.32]This is really loud.
[46:48.18]You're right, it is.
[46:55.04]Now what?
[46:55.50]What's going on here?
[47:09.76]What happened to the organ game?
[47:17.09]Um, I got two endings.
[47:21.45]And... I thought it was a really fun game.
[47:25.93]I realized that Coin Game had an update that I didn't know about.
[47:29.46]And now chat was very, very excited about it.
[47:31.96]Incredibly excited about this update.
[47:35.92]So I was like, you know what?
[47:36.94]Fine.
[47:37.80]We'll play this too.
[47:40.95]OrganDev, thank you on Twitter.
[47:42.16]It was really sweet.
[47:42.78]That game was very, very, very fun.
[47:47.46]That was, like, I would give that at least, I mean, something high.
[47:51.14]That was fucking really good.
[47:52.86]I might play it again on my own time.
[47:59.14]You got bullied into playing Coin Game.
[48:06.90]This game is really fun, too.
[48:10.49]There it is.
[48:10.97]Finally.
[48:11.45]Alright.
[48:11.95]I got three.
[48:12.41]Alright.
[48:18.28]One more.
[48:20.52]One more jackpot and I'm done.
[48:30.48]Come on.
[48:31.20]One more.
[48:38.55]Come on.
[48:40.58]You gotta play Dizzy Bird?
[48:41.34]I'll play Dizzy Bird.
[48:44.14]I've lost my magic here.
[48:45.24]There we go.
[48:48.74]Get away from my ship.
[49:01.39]Okay.
[49:11.57]So much dopamine.
[49:12.73]There really is dopamine.
[49:13.77]I'll play this one too.
[49:18.06]Is this one new?
[49:23.44]It's not bad.
[49:27.67]2500 is on there too.
[49:29.59]Holy crap.
[49:38.15]I never play these when I go to the arcade.
[49:39.40]They feel too random.
[49:40.14]I feel like I have no control over what's going on right now.
[49:50.26]The organ game actually updated for you.
[49:53.42]No, it did not.
[49:58.23]The organ trader dev actually updated the game to spite chat.
[50:01.91]What?
[50:04.51]No, they didn't.
[50:05.67]Hold on.
[50:13.42]What was the update?
[50:15.76]No joke.
[50:20.84]Hold on.
[50:21.44]What was the Twitter again?
[50:23.26]I just moved out.
[50:24.48]I just closed out of the window.
[50:25.88]Oh, hey, chat.
[50:34.11]You got proof?
[50:38.51]Okay.
[50:45.18]Okay.
[50:45.44]What was the update?
[50:51.33]It said, I do not fuck around.
[50:54.67]Update queued.
[51:01.28]Wait, hold on.
[51:02.02]This is actually hilarious.
[51:09.64]Okay.
[51:14.77]Okay, let me read this.
[51:19.15]He found his Kinect.
[51:23.46]He read the tweets live on stream like my parents on Christmas.
[51:30.20]Jerma putting even more cash into XCormic's remnants to drive down his average price paid and justified in his investment with a big meme face.
[51:41.00]He gets it.
[51:44.36]Portions of the chat kept asking for a different game so often that he switched to emote only so they'd shut the fuck up and he could concentrate on trading organs.
[51:51.37]That might be the best endorsement I've seen of the game so far, holy shit.
[51:58.64]He was holding his urine for four hours to keep playing.
[52:07.50]Building and uploading a new Steam version specifically so that the chat isn't gaslighting Jerma about a new update anymore.
[52:19.36]Are you kidding me?
[52:20.16]That's actually hilarious.
[52:32.39]One guy in this chat
[52:35.29]said, hey dude, go back, they updated Oregon Trading Simulator, LOL.
[52:39.16]I was like, ah, that's funny.
[52:43.80]They go and update it, and you actually were correct about that.
[52:48.50]That's a pretty huge one-guy moment.
[52:53.24]Just to spite the chat.
[52:54.32]There's an update actually queued for it.
[52:57.28]That's so funny.
[53:03.05]That's too funny.
[53:06.33]Well, they said thanks for playing the game.
[53:07.60]I mean, the game's great.
[53:09.26]You should be very proud of what you've made.
[53:13.24]It's very fun.
[53:18.92]Give me my cards back.
[53:20.81]I like playing these.
[53:21.35]These are fun.
[53:27.93]See if I get the bonus.
[53:34.49]I always like to... I queue up the coins.
[53:35.99]I don't like doing one and then wait.
[53:37.37]I just... At the arcade, I go one.
[53:40.07]Two.
[53:41.09]Three.
[53:41.33]Four.
[53:42.43]Bonus.
[53:43.11]Five.
[53:43.35]Bonus.
[53:44.09]Six.
[53:44.35]Bonus.
[53:45.01]Seven.
[53:45.27]Bonus.
[53:45.63]Right?
[53:45.79]Then you stop.
[53:49.55]See?
[53:50.13]I'm throwing off.
[53:55.62]Where's Dizzy Bird?
[53:56.14]I want to play Dizzy Bird.
[53:58.42]After this.
[54:08.64]Okay.
[54:09.06]Well, I... That was... I think the game was broken.
[54:11.36]That was weird.
[54:11.82]Give me this.
[54:21.38]Flying around this place.
[54:26.06]Why am I LARPing here?
[54:27.54]What am I doing?
[54:31.90]Whee!
[54:32.20]Yay!
[54:39.11]Let me put the... Ooh.
[54:51.40]I remember watching the Critical video.
[54:54.66]Where he just literally won this every single time.
[54:56.88]That video is actually like an S video.
[55:00.29]S+.
[55:28.75]First try, let's go.
[55:31.19]How much is that?
[55:31.65]2,000 tickets?
[55:32.53]I'll take them.
[55:32.89]You have to understand something.
[55:37.72]I watched that critical video.
[55:41.06]I can beat this every time.
[55:48.40]I think these are new.
[55:49.06]I don't remember these being here.
[55:50.04]Yeah, this is definitely new stuff.
[56:01.24]What?
[56:12.49]What?
[56:16.71]Networking Andy.
[56:21.53]I said I was a fan of Critical's videos.
[56:25.27]That's not networking Andy, that's recognizing a good content creator.
[56:53.47]Pinball machine drops frames.
[56:56.51]That's alright.
[56:57.07]It's fine.
[57:00.85]Oh my god.
[57:01.59]Why do those exist?
[57:04.53]Biggest scam in the pinball industry ever is having that spot on the left and right where the ball just drops down.
[57:09.33]It's so dumb.
[57:09.91]If a pinball game is supposed to be about skill, then what the hell is the point of those?
[57:27.07]There's nothing fun about the left and right traps.
[57:29.89]Nothing.
[57:32.68]Nothing fun about pinball in general.
[57:34.72]Like, I don't even know why I play it.
[57:36.10]Like, it's literally, why would I play pinball?
[57:43.08]Oh!
[57:44.32]What?
[57:49.92]What is this?
[57:51.88]Space invaders?
[58:00.93]This is so cool.
[58:05.25]The dev of this game seriously put so much time into this.
[58:09.76]What are there?
[58:11.02]Like 60 or 70 machines now to play?
[58:12.96]Maybe more.
[58:13.70]I don't even know.
[58:14.26]There's a lot in this game.
[58:15.82]This is like the fourth plus, I think, fourth or fifth time I've played this on stream.
[58:20.30]They just keep adding stuff.
[58:29.39]I'll get it.
[58:29.67]I'll get it.
[58:30.27]I got it.
[58:38.00]Alright, come on.
[58:38.58]Are these little popcorns?
[58:44.73]What are they?
[58:45.11]Do mini-golf?
[58:47.89]Yeah, I'll do mini-golf after this.
[58:56.70]I forgot this.
[58:57.18]I thought this was a different day.
[58:59.42]And I was under the desk with that hair.
[59:01.22]I thought that was four days ago.
[59:12.24]Alright, you gotta use defense here.
[59:16.73]Oh, shit.
[59:17.27]Alright, I lost.
[59:17.99]Nah, I don't want to play this anymore.
[59:27.51]Oops.
[59:33.59]Get in!
[59:33.99]What's wrong with me?
[59:41.25]Uh...
[59:44.74]Do I think this is the- what- what am- Oh no, I'm trapped in here.
[59:52.03]I can't grab anything.
[59:53.07]What's wrong with my arms?
[59:56.49]What?
[60:21.31]Good.
[60:30.77]Let us peep the horror.
[60:33.64]No!
[60:36.08]I'm busy.
[60:36.56]It's like the third time I've said that today, isn't it?
[60:39.16]Alright, cool.
[60:41.14]What else is here that's new?
[60:43.84]This one?
[60:44.16]Ooh...
[60:50.28]Oh, shit.
[60:50.88]Alright.
[60:52.30]I get it.
[60:58.60]You just don't want to get it in the big ones.
[61:00.10]Okay, I see.
[61:03.32]Bonus spin.
[61:06.85]Hell yeah.
[61:07.29]Let's go.
[61:11.89]What do I get?
[61:12.29]Give me the whole 3,000.
[61:21.12]Eh, that's alright.
[61:30.51]Not bad.
[61:31.83]That's not bad.
[61:33.29]That's not bad.
[61:35.97]I think that one was here.
[61:37.17]These three definitely were not.
[61:42.93]Oh, this shit.
[61:44.21]Not this again.
[61:44.99]I was obsessed with this.
[61:49.57]Wait.
[61:57.08]Now this is the children's roulette.
[61:58.92]Yeah.
[61:59.54]I had it wrong.
[62:09.89]I'm not going to spend time here.
[62:11.09]Don't worry.
[62:11.37]I'm out.
[62:11.63]I'm going to do mini golf.
[62:20.23]Should I count my tickets?
[62:21.03]How many tickets do I have?
[62:26.50]Where's the ticket counting machine?
[62:27.84]Alright, mini golf.
[62:35.82]I'll play 18 holes.
[62:36.84]That might be way too much.
[62:39.98]Oh boy, that's probably... I made a mistake.
[62:42.01]Nice vans?
[62:55.45]Hey, thanks.
[62:58.44]Is it a part two?
[62:59.38]Alright.
[63:00.52]Let's go.
[63:00.82]Check this out.
[63:04.86]Hole-in-one.
[63:06.69]Hole-in-one arrival gift.
[63:11.05]Ten... Dollars.
[63:16.83]Auto.
[63:18.09]For a new toy.
[63:18.69]Alright.
[63:24.75]Hole-in-one right here.
[63:29.25]I will... Never mind.
[63:38.00]Those are the real stakes.
[63:42.43]Does anybody else not have the patience for mini-golf at all?
[63:50.79]There's nothing in this world that infuriates me more than this game.
[63:57.76]Because once you go over three or four strokes, you just get pissed and kind of embarrassed.
[64:07.10]Especially if your ball bounces out of the play field.
[64:14.66]And then you end up just dragging the ball over into the cup.
[64:29.11]I used to hate mini golf.
[64:30.23]I really did.
[64:32.69]It's kind of weird because I really don't like mini golf and I don't like bowling either.
[64:37.45]I just get frustrated and annoyed and impatient.
[64:47.78]Bowling is sick, dude.
[64:49.40]Trust me, I know.
[64:50.98]I like watching good bowlers.
[64:52.48]I don't like to bowl myself.
[64:53.60]I just can't.
[64:59.06]Let me break.
[64:59.40]At this point I'm going to go on the right side.
[65:04.28]Come on.
[65:13.21]Really?
[65:13.49]That's it right there.
[65:28.14]That would have been great.
[65:33.72]Too hard.
[65:35.64]See, right now, my lips just went like this.
[65:37.86]Okay, if I'm actually in the mini golf place, my mouth just went like this.
[65:45.00]That happens.
[65:55.17]My lips go, mm-hmm.
[66:02.49]Oh, right up here.
[66:08.75]Okay, if I get a hole-in-one at any point during this course, then I'm going to eat a pepperoni pizza tonight.
[66:18.37]If not, then it's all salads.
[66:21.03]We're talking kale, spinach, radishes, maybe some red onion.
[66:27.37]No, I want a hole-in-one and I'm going to get a pepperoni pizza.
[66:29.89]Or I have to eat a gross salad.
[66:44.15]Oh, I was gonna say it's pizza tonight!
[66:45.87]No, I don't want to eat a salad.
[66:49.73]I like salads, but I don't want them for dinner.
[67:00.17]You are so dumb.
[67:01.51]Why would I go with-
[67:15.52]How's it going?
[67:18.82]Salad night tonight.
[67:21.42]It's looking more and more like salad night.
[67:27.34]This is my chance.
[67:28.08]This is, yeah, this is my chance.
[67:30.74]Right at the end, right there.
[67:35.04]That'll do it.
[67:37.45]Oh, no.
[67:46.84]Doesn't want to eat vegetables.
[67:54.33]Oh, golf sucks.
[67:56.05]I hate this sport so much.
[67:59.29]It just perplexes me.
[68:01.45]It intrigues me.
[68:03.27]I don't want to play this.
[68:05.22]Oh, you want to have a round of golf?
[68:09.50]No.
[68:09.74]No.
[68:10.78]No.
[68:16.07]Like, can't we play frisbee?
[68:17.77]That sounds like more fun.
[68:18.75]I don't want to play golf.
[68:22.81]Once you hit like 35 years old or like 30, it's almost like you're supposed to like this.
[68:29.84]I don't.
[68:30.30]And it's treated so like, oh my god, it's the best.
[68:38.29]It's so much fun.
[68:38.85]It's so incredible.
[68:40.67]I don't like, I don't want to walk around and chase balls.
[68:49.73]I don't want to take like a big drive and have the ball slice across.
[68:52.85]No.
[68:57.35]It takes so long.
[68:58.39]It takes an entire day to play.
[69:05.11]It takes way too long to play.
[69:07.15]And you can't play three rounds.
[69:08.81]You can't do three holes.
[69:10.11]People will be like, no, I want to do nine.
[69:12.39]Let's do nine.
[69:14.13]By the way, let's wake up at four o'clock in the morning.
[69:16.17]What are you doing?
[69:22.88]It's like everything I hate about the whole universe.
[69:26.80]Wake up wicked early, walk around like miles, and swing and try to hit a tiny little thing.
[69:37.29]It's like all my least favorite things in the world.
[69:39.13]I don't like anything about it.
[69:40.31]Anything about it.
[69:49.95]Why is her name Gascan?
[69:52.88]I don't know, because it's easy to remember.
[69:54.24]That counts, I get pizza.
[69:59.04]That counts, I get pepperoni pizza tonight.
[70:11.41]I like this little lightning they're doing here.
[70:19.16]I don't mind golf.
[70:29.04]It's so ASMR.
[70:32.76]Golf is the original ASMR.
[70:34.14]It looks like he's going to be at the... He's in the sand pit here.
[70:49.01]See if he can try to get his way out of that.
[70:52.64]One small little swing will do it, I think.
[71:08.85]Why don't they just put the announcers?
[71:14.15]Why is it such a big deal?
[71:17.93]We have people that go up to bat in baseball games in stadiums full of 60,000 to 70,000 people screaming.
[71:24.15]Everybody's going to be so quiet at the golf course.
[71:29.50]He's going to swing and hit this thing.
[71:31.48]They have to swing and hit things in baseball.
[71:34.28]The things that are coming at them 100 miles per hour.
[71:49.97]Imagine a stadium for golf.
[71:51.29]I actually would probably like it a little bit more.
[71:53.97]I'm not kidding.
[71:57.01]If there was like a putting competition and everyone was just fucking chugging beers and like freaking out and screaming.
[72:04.67]I think that would be so entertaining.
[72:05.99]I think that would be so funny.
[72:13.48]Mini golf.
[72:13.90]Why is there not a mini golf stadium event?
[72:21.50]I think that would be so awesome.
[72:34.57]Oh, don't even.
[72:35.65]Please don't give me more ideas.
[72:41.92]Can you imagine how dumb that would be?
[72:45.03]There was like a stadium with like 40,000 people in it.
[72:48.57]And it was just a mini golf course.
[72:49.85]And the course was wicked fucked up.
[72:52.22]Just crazy shit happening.
[73:00.12]Let me do baseball first and then we'll see.
[73:09.75]No, I'm obviously just messing around.
[73:12.47]Golf is fine.
[73:13.23]I just find it to be boring.
[73:15.33]But, I mean, everyone has to be quiet.
[73:27.63]Wait, somebody said Viva La Bam did that in 2004.
[73:31.11]Did they really?
[73:33.61]What?
[73:35.67]How do you remember that?
[73:55.24]You're describing holy moly?
[73:58.42]Wait a minute.
[74:00.50]I'm very curious at this point.
[74:02.60]What is holy moly?
[74:04.20]Holy moly show?
[74:09.33]Uh-huh.
[74:25.18]Everyone has two chapters in their lives.
[74:27.62]Oh, everyone wants a McDonald's.
[74:29.73]The first Big Mac.
[74:30.79]And after their first Big Mac.
[74:32.39]Oh, delicious McDonald's chicken McNuggets.
[74:35.15]This is a real show.
[74:49.78]I can't believe this is a real show.
[74:51.93]Holy moly.
[74:52.65]Is it Bam Margera?
[74:53.57]What?
[74:53.81]They got celebrities to do this?
[74:55.91]And maybe at the end.
[75:14.39]Now sit back and relax.
[75:16.27]I don't know why I thought that was a big Mac for McDonald's I thought there was another ad playing or he was in this or something.
[75:23.03]This is holy moly I Can't believe this is real
[75:45.39]Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.
[75:49.33]Why do they have to do this?
[75:51.37]Why do they have to go up the aggro crag?
[75:54.31]What does this have to do with mini golf?
[76:17.53]It's Ninja Warrior, Most Extreme Elimination Challenge, Wipeout, and Golf.
[76:24.23]Is this on TV still?
[76:25.09]This is June of 2019 is this trailer.
[76:53.08]He said no shot.
[76:54.78]No shot?
[76:55.64]Hold on.
[76:56.02]Let me see.
[76:56.48]Holy Moly canceled.
[76:57.78]Let me type that.
[76:59.45]Holy Moly canceled.
[77:05.27]Holy Moly has been renewed through a fourth season.
[77:07.77]Season 3 will debut June 17th, 2021.
[77:12.16]Still on the air.
[77:16.10]Well, never mind.
[77:17.32]There goes that idea.
[77:18.74]It was a good one.
[77:24.03]I just accidentally just did that to 12,000 people.
[77:26.89]I just gave you an advertisement to go watch that show.
[77:31.27]Well, let me know how it is.
[77:33.35]Alright.
[77:46.06]Hey, I got a hole in one.
[77:48.48]That means I get pepperoni pizza.
[77:50.66]1,000 tickets.
[77:51.36]Holy moly.
[77:56.67]I gotta go to McDonald's first.
[77:57.69]You need to go to McDonald's to get yourself a quarter pounder with extra cheese.
[78:07.77]Why do I keep doing that?
[78:14.86]Oh, now I want McDonald's.
[78:17.30]Why does all advertising work?
[78:31.17]Don't spray me.
[78:35.17]I love these little things.
[78:36.21]Nice.
[78:37.15]Right there.
[78:37.89]Get that rat.
[78:38.85]Got it.
[78:53.70]What did it land on?
[78:54.63]Ten bucks?
[78:59.77]I think I got them all.
[79:04.33]Got them alright.
[79:08.55]The title.
[79:09.49]Oh, the title is Buying and Selling Organs.
[79:12.10]You're right.
[79:12.64]It's alright.
[79:18.56]Don't shoot again.
[79:19.06]Where's my mouse?
[79:21.85]I lost my mouse.
[79:24.71]No.
[79:27.87]This is not good.
[79:28.59]Where'd my mouse go?
[79:32.34]Mouse.
[79:33.42]On the screen.
[79:33.96]This is bad.
[79:41.83]Okay.
[79:42.37]Did I see everything in the update?
[79:48.13]I can't get out of this.
[79:55.50]I have seen... Okay.
[79:57.62]I got to alt-tab.
[79:59.89]Alright, we're going to go just chatting for three minutes.
[80:05.56]I want to make this really clear.
[80:06.42]I mean, we've been going for like five hours.
[80:08.10]I think we're okay.
[80:09.28]I did what I wanted to do.
[80:09.95]We're going to go just chatting for like five minutes.
[80:16.95]Because I need to have it be over five hours, so it makes it look like I streamed for five hours.
[80:23.68]Very important, before anybody leaves, I know I'm saying, alright, that's it, but listen here, it's very important.

[81:23.61]I'm just gonna go like this for a minute.
[81:24.82]What's up?
[81:34.19]Oh, my lips are like purple.
[81:35.17]I think it's the white balance.
[81:37.45]Yeah, the white balance is so off.
[81:44.26]What did I get, Otto for Christmas?
[81:46.40]This little carton, it's a little milk carton, and there's cookies in it.
[81:50.31]And he can fish out the cookies, and they're tethered to the inside of the milk carton, and they squeak.
[81:55.05]Is this a Reddit shirt?
[82:00.16]Okay.
[82:01.90]There's not many things that I get upset about, but this is an Andy Mark shirt.
[82:07.23]And Andy Mark is... You do not talk about Andy Mark like that.
[82:12.05]How dare you.
[82:13.58]This is an Andy Mark shirt.
[82:17.32]You just saw like this top part.
[82:23.28]And if you don't know, Andy Mark is responsible for the carnival robots.
[82:27.07]And they're also responsible for putting almost the entire dollhouse set together.
[82:33.33]And all like the little kind of toys and tools that went into that.
[82:37.61]But also with like a set director too.
[82:39.37]Or a set designer.
[82:42.34]They pretty much were responsible for almost that whole thing.
[82:45.60]Andy Mark.
[82:48.02]We love Andy Mark here.
[82:48.88]We really do.
[82:51.20]Are you going to stream any more Monster Rancher?
[82:52.88]I want to stream more Monster Rancher, but I'm just... Other things come up.
[82:58.09]I did promise we would beat S rank, and I'm going to adhere to that promise.
[83:03.43]I promise we will.
[83:04.37]Eventually.
[83:07.02]What do Americans eat for Christmas?
[83:09.58]Um, it depends.
[83:11.58]Ham?
[83:13.46]Ash potatoes?
[83:15.14]Corned beef?
[83:16.58]A big, like, corned beef and cabbage?
[83:19.54]Hot roast?
[83:20.25]Roast beef?
[83:23.85]Yeah, roast beef.
[83:24.85]Turkey.

[83:33.20]Did you get any cool toys for Christmas?
[83:37.60]Hold on.
[83:37.92]Somebody said, please never do a best errand category again.
[83:40.86]It causes me physical pain.
[83:42.09]What do you mean?
[83:53.21]I'll take that feedback.
[83:54.79]I'll take that feedback and I'll process that feedback.
[83:58.61]Do you eat liver and onions?
[83:59.94]Liver and onions are disgusting.
[84:00.88]Liver is disgusting.
[84:03.48]Liver is such an incredible thing to eat.
[84:05.16]It has like the most iron your body can possibly get.
[84:07.70]It's so dense in nutrients.
[84:09.96]But it is revolting.
[84:11.48]I find it to be disgusting.
[84:16.00]I don't like golf and I don't like liver.
[84:18.87]Sorry.
[84:18.99]Sorry.
[84:25.39]So fuck you, I love liver.
[84:29.43]Alright, I'm out.
