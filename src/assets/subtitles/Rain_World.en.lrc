[00:46.39]Anybody notice the name of the stream and the game of the stream?
[00:53.27]Nose pimple?
[00:56.07]Hold on, let me turn this up.
[01:01.47]Nose pimple?
[01:02.15]Where?
[01:02.41]I don't see a nose pimple.
[01:14.68]What are you talking about?
[01:17.75]No, we're good.
[01:21.15]Turn to the side.
[01:29.47]I got nothing there.
[01:30.19]You guys are lying.
[01:30.79]Alright, let's play Rain World for a little bit.
[01:39.26]By the way, I'm going into this upset.
[01:42.64]Let's see if it makes me happy.
[01:44.68]I'm going to this upset.
[01:46.44]Let's see if it like, if you guys were right.
[01:51.80]And I am not going to hold back any criticisms of this game.
[01:55.27]I'm going to criticize it if I don't like it because it was your choice.
[01:58.71]Five of you.
[02:06.66]Is this a controller game or what?
[02:16.10]Controller, yeah.
[02:18.48]Let's plug it in.
[02:27.29]Fucking hell.
[02:28.77]Alright, here, here.
[02:29.37]You think I'm not lying to you?
[02:30.77]I'm not lying.
[02:31.90]It's actually opening.
[02:32.92]It's opening right now.
[02:36.52]I swear to God.
[02:37.92]People think I'm making it up.
[02:39.00]No, I didn't.
[02:39.44]Yeah, I did.
[02:49.61]Alright, here I come.
[03:17.92]I have an Xbox controller.
[03:23.38]Don't swim?
[03:26.99]Actual Rain World.
[03:31.67]We played him like a fiddle.
[03:39.75]I want to know.
[03:44.74]Rain World.
[03:47.20]The monk.
[03:51.16]Weak of body but strong of spirit, in tune with the mysteries of the world, and empathetic to its creatures, your journey will be a significantly more peaceful one.
[04:00.64]The Survivor.
[04:01.98]A nimble omnivore, both predator and prey, lost in a harsh and indifferent land, you must make your own way, with wit and caution as your greatest asset.
[04:12.67]The Hunter.
[04:13.73]Strong and quick, with a fierce metabolism, requiring a steady diet of meat.
[04:18.33]The stomach won't be your only concern as the path of the hunter is one of extreme peril.
[04:29.22]Omnivore?
[04:31.66]I'll do Omnivore.
[04:32.34]I need meat and plants.
[04:36.19]That sounds good.
[05:05.09]Okay, and this is where we call to F4.
[05:18.20]Don't ever tell me to fucking play a game.
[05:19.92]Don't ever force me to quit a game ever again.
[05:32.28]So what happened?
[05:44.81]Oh no, I'm falling!
[06:13.63]How's this game played?
[06:17.79]Was there an actual wink?
[06:18.55]There was.
[06:18.85]Yeah, there was.
[06:23.73]Move this down.
[06:24.37]Just keep it on.
[06:32.13]Alright, we have a map.
[06:35.52]Eat, throw, and jump.
[06:40.22]Eat.
[06:42.46]Pick up and eat.
[06:43.66]This is the map.
[06:44.32]Okay.
[06:47.52]This is pause.
[06:48.72]Alright.
[06:48.92]And there's also throw.
[06:52.49]Okay.
[06:57.95]Okay.
[07:01.58]Can I climb?
[07:02.22]Can I climb up on stuff?
[07:05.13]You are hungry.
[07:05.75]Find food.
[07:06.33]What do I eat?
[07:11.63]Play Elderborn or I am leaving.
[07:13.22]You bastard.
[07:21.20]Can I eat that?
[07:34.48]What is it doing?
[07:45.51]It's just following me around.
[08:01.63]I can't eat it.
[08:02.34]I can't eat that.
[08:11.05]Oh, this is the tutorial.
[08:14.51]I'm trying to eat the tutorial friend.
[08:28.24]Catch and eat them.
[08:29.54]Oh, eat it.
[08:35.30]And it's x to eat?
[08:36.24]OK.
[08:47.03]4 is enough to hibernate.
[08:48.27]Hibernate?
[08:52.35]How do you hibernate?
[09:17.44]character's pretty cute do you evolve or something jump and grab them they're delicious I thought I said I was already full additional food above four is kept for later
[09:47.91]Kept for later.
[09:55.56]Okay, you are full.
[09:58.30]I can't eat any more food?
[10:01.46]I can't hear anything.
[10:03.20]I'll fix that.
[10:06.02]Okay.
[10:08.04]Let's go.
[10:19.97]Elderborn waiting room?
[10:21.83]Nope.
[10:24.73]This is what you get in Leap the Gap.
[10:32.87]That didn't work.
[10:42.30]This game is terrifying.
[10:47.96]And then Old A?
[10:54.14]Okay.
[10:56.90]Down... Down A. What the fuck are you trying to tell me to do?
[11:07.22]Okay.
[11:14.57]Briefly tap down to crouch.
[11:16.83]That's what I just did.
[11:18.25]When crouching, hold the jump button without giving other input.
[11:24.18]And then let it go and move in a direction.
[11:26.72]Okay, that was not very clear.
[11:31.80]Rain is coming.
[11:32.60]Find shelter.
[11:38.07]Does this count as shelter?
[11:44.99]Run.
[11:45.51]What do you mean run?
[11:49.97]This place is safe.
[11:50.97]Stay here to hibernate.
[12:06.22]Continue?
[12:06.88]Should I go?
[12:09.44]Two.
[12:11.21]I evolved.
[12:12.01]I think I'm a new creature.
[12:31.19]Go explore.
[12:31.65]There is food and shelter to be found, but beware of predators.
[12:33.93]Alright.
[12:37.74]Oh my god, this is a big map.
[12:39.64]Alright, so we're going to go up.
[12:41.80]Up this way.
[12:45.48]Game's kind of rad.
[12:48.87]We'll see.
[12:50.31]We'll see.
[12:51.31]Objects can be picked up, carried, and tossed.
[13:00.26]Why would I want to do this, though?
[13:02.60]What am I throwing it at?
[13:03.46]I mean, that's definitely to fight off shit.
[13:07.14]Alright, let's eat all this food.
[13:17.37]Eat?
[13:17.91]Eat the food?
[13:21.59]I can't eat two at the same time?
[13:22.65]Why not?
[13:22.93]Okay.
[13:37.93]Okay.
[13:38.77]Two more.
[13:41.19]What happens if I'm out in the rain?
[13:43.57]Will I get... Did you die?
[13:45.15]Is that, like, the death scenario?
[13:46.11]Alright, well, I've eaten.
[13:57.30]I can make that.
[14:04.13]Come on.
[14:12.64]Maybe I can't.
[14:14.60]I can just climb it?
[14:15.38]Oh.
[14:23.39]Well, there's nothing even over here.
[14:33.73]Oops.
[14:34.33]What?
[14:36.79]Oh.
[14:37.90]Well, I didn't know you could do that.
[14:41.59]Okay.
[14:42.43]Okay.
[14:45.71]Well, now you know.
[14:46.41]Did that really do very much?
[14:56.52]I guess I could go that way.
[14:57.84]Did I climb up?
[15:06.64]Let's go over here.
[15:12.64]What, any smilers?
[15:14.02]What does that... What do you mean, any smilers?
[15:15.44]I need a stick to throw over there.
[15:41.09]Enable smile on BTTV.
[15:43.05]Should I?
[15:45.44]I can't get in here yet.
[15:46.28]Can I go from here up?
[15:51.90]No.
[15:55.56]I think I need to throw a stick over there.
[15:58.20]What about down here?
[16:04.13]Oh, I got it.
[16:04.73]There's a stick right here.
[16:12.76]Alright, climb this.
[16:14.20]What's in my hand?
[16:19.28]It's a rock, okay.
[16:23.86]Can't climb this?
[16:28.09]There we go.
[16:28.43]Alright, and then can I climb from here?
[16:48.83]I guess I'm just gonna go this way.
[16:49.74]Is there some life support?
[16:53.20]I'm trying to, like, go up there.
[16:54.38]I mean, I know this exists.
[16:59.76]I was trying to see if I could do this first.
[17:01.04]What the fuck is that? ...
[17:20.61]Can I kill it?
[17:28.56]Here is a strange energy.
[17:30.14]Alright, hold on.
[17:36.32]I'm going way too far.
[17:37.54]I'm going way too fast.
[17:41.11]Can I eat this thing?
[17:41.91]Eat the weird flower?
[17:53.92]Alright, pick up the rock in case that lizard comes back and I'll throw it right in his head.
[18:15.64]Okay, probably should leave.
[18:19.62]This is probably a bad idea.
[18:20.66]Whoa!
[18:21.50]Am I prey?
[18:23.33]Am I prey to this guy?
[18:24.45]I might be prey.
[18:30.47]Alright, I'm gonna say... What do the blue circles mean?
[18:35.09]Does that mean, like, hey, go here?
[18:36.81]You gotta go here?
[18:37.43]I'm gonna go right.
[18:43.71]You're prey to everything.
[18:44.83]Alright, where am I now?
[18:45.57]Maybe I should go up?
[18:50.25]Oh, fuck it.
[19:06.08]Or should I go from here?
[19:08.40]I'm gonna go up, I guess.
[19:11.83]And then... I got a stick.
[19:13.43]I'm bringing a stick over here.
[19:25.15]Encourage the cowardly dog.
[19:30.01]OST.
[19:31.79]Why does it have to be an OST?
[19:34.47]Alright, so now I have a stick.
[19:39.18]now let up I go up here okay and then up again okay um this is shelter
[20:09.73]I've never done that.
[20:12.61]Oh, okay.
[20:21.56]I don't understand what this is doing.
[20:24.36]Is it a link?
[20:34.92]I still don't know what this does.
[20:42.36]Hold on, my eyes are getting flooded.
[20:44.30]Okay.
[20:46.38]Need to eat more food.
[20:47.74]I'm gonna go down, I'm gonna go to the left.
[20:49.86]Down and left.
[20:51.38]Still have my stick?
[20:52.98]I do.
[20:56.48]It's crying.
[21:04.47]What do you want?
[21:05.15]Oh, it's saying, food, food, down here.
[21:06.55]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[21:07.09]There's probably food over here.
[21:19.00]I'm going to keep going left.
[21:20.51]Can I eat those?
[21:21.35]Can I eat the plants?
[21:23.09]Can I eat these?
[21:24.40]I'd like to tear something off and eat it.
[21:48.81]Who wins?
[21:51.12]Can I come in there and clean up the meeting?
[22:12.60]No, they're still alive.
[22:13.61]What?
[22:13.81]I don't think I can... I guess I'm going to go over here.
[22:20.03]It's booed that way.
[22:26.01]Can I go up?
[22:26.55]Alright, I'm going to sneak around here.
[22:29.68]Why am I going this way?
[22:33.02]This seems like a really bad idea.
[22:42.83]Food?
[22:47.37]I don't think I should be doing this.
[22:58.68]They're gonna come back and kill me or something.
[23:16.56]Oh, he's dead.
[23:17.10]Alright.
[23:17.58]Now throw this spear in the back of his head.
[23:20.71]Alright, I'm gonna get the scraps.
[23:30.81]Alright, bring him back to my cave!
[23:44.47]This is food for a week!
[23:45.35]Uh-oh!
[23:52.54]Uh-oh!
[23:53.22]Uh-oh!
[23:53.40]Do you know I'm here?
[24:05.83]Eat this!
[24:06.29]Why can't I eat it?
[24:07.15]Eat it!
[24:07.39]Eat it!
[24:08.85]Eat it!
[24:09.95]Eat it!
[24:11.25]Why won't he eat it?
[24:13.11]I don't want to hear that.
[24:44.12]I don't know what the fuck I was thinking, Mark.
[24:46.36]I was thinking maybe that would work.
[24:50.64]What is this in here?
[24:52.70]Gee.
[24:55.87]Alright, give me a bat.
[25:07.81]I need to eat something.
[25:23.18]I don't think I should be out in the open like this.
[25:25.64]Oh my god.
[25:27.30]Eat that plant!
[25:29.04]Eat this plant!
[25:31.56]Quick, eat it!
[25:32.26]Hide!
[25:53.73]Eat.
[25:54.27]Why can I eat this?
[25:56.13]Eat.
[25:57.13]It's X, right?
[25:57.99]Eat?
[26:01.21]How do I eat this plant?
[26:06.71]It's not food?
[26:08.46]Everything is food in the goddamn wild.
[26:10.56]Come here.
[26:33.42]Oh fuck, I think I just- Whoa, okay.
[26:35.31]Are you stupid?
[26:51.35]Oh my god, they're finding me.
[26:52.29]Get in that hole!
[26:55.09]Come here.
[26:56.83]He's chasing me.
[26:57.77]Wait.
[26:59.65]Oh, the rain's coming!
[27:20.81]What's this shelter look like?
[27:22.83]What's this shelter look like?
[27:31.93]I don't know.
[27:32.55]What do you mean you don't know?
[27:33.95]I don't know what a shelter looks like on the minimap.
[27:47.96]Am I safe in here?
[27:53.79]Oh my god.
[28:03.24]Holy shit!
[28:06.44]Where'd I go?
[28:07.04]I can't go anywhere.
[28:31.66]Game over.
[28:41.55]But that's it.
[28:43.07]That's it.
[28:49.13]No, it's not.
[28:49.53]I'm right here.
[28:53.65]Okay, what does it actually look like?
[29:02.01]That's fear.
[29:02.57]Hold on.
[29:04.29]They have that...
[29:07.07]Like a circle.
[29:08.29]It's a square.
[29:08.97]Okay.
[29:13.66]This is pretty cool, actually.
[29:18.00]So, let me remember where this is.
[29:20.60]So, right there is... So, we're going to go right this time.
[29:24.00]We'll go down to the left.
[29:27.18]That was right again.
[29:28.00]I don't love it.
[29:29.22]I think it's alright.
[29:30.05]I think it's alright.
[29:49.36]I'm gonna go right.
[29:52.40]Alright, any food?
[30:04.13]Will you leave me alone, dude?
[30:05.49]Alright, so left and then up.
[30:15.25]So up here is a shelter.
[30:16.35]Gotta remember that.
[30:23.21]Oh, fuck.
[30:24.31]We just went by each other.
[30:29.96]We just called each other at the same time.
[30:31.48]Okay.
[30:47.25]Still way to go over this way.
[31:09.91]Wait.
[31:10.35]Bats.
[31:13.39]Eat.
[31:15.11]Eat a bat.
[31:15.51]Alright, good.
[31:17.49]Alright.
[31:19.61]Better than last time.
[31:24.65]I got a full stomach.
[31:25.69]I'm gonna go underneath.
[31:31.63]Now I'm gonna go hibernate.
[31:35.89]But I want... I want more food.
[31:38.93]I want even more food than this.
[31:40.85]I know.
[31:41.05]I got like a bad nerd neck.
[31:42.17]I know.
[31:42.51]Trust me.
[31:42.83]I'm aware of it.
[31:49.16]Alright.
[31:49.38]Now we're good.
[31:50.65]Now we go back to... Is that spikes?
[31:52.51]Alright.
[31:53.77]Let's go.
[31:54.07]Let's get out of here.
[32:04.98]Wait, there's a shelter right here.
[32:06.88]Who's saying shelter?
[32:07.66]Shelter right here.
[32:08.39]Shelter.
[32:08.75]I can't reach that.
[32:41.80]I can't.
[32:44.22]Oh!
[32:44.38]Am I down?
[32:46.30]Where am I?
[32:47.84]We're both in the same tunnel.
[32:49.40]Get out of my way.
[32:57.91]Alright.
[32:58.19]I'm fucking out.
[32:58.87]I'm just going.
[32:59.37]Just go.
[32:59.71]Go.
[32:59.91]Go.
[33:00.09]Just get out.
[33:00.45]Get the fuck out of here.
[33:01.21]Get out.
[33:04.93]Just go.
[33:05.25]Get me out.
[33:05.61]Get me the fuck out.
[33:06.47]Get me the fuck out.
[33:07.03]I'm just going to the other shelter I was in before.
[33:08.56]Get me the fuck out.
[33:09.84]What is that?
[33:14.89]Why is there so much shit over here?
[33:34.38]Okay.
[33:35.06]Let's go left.
[33:53.31]Up again.
[33:53.71]And then there's a shelter right in here.
[33:57.53]Right is right.
[34:00.59]What is it?
[34:01.92]Left and then up.
[34:03.04]Okay.
[34:03.50]Cool.
[34:06.38]Oh, right.
[34:06.98]My stream title is still that.
[34:10.94]Only streaming for 20 minutes.
[34:15.92]Oh, man.
[34:25.75]It really does say that.
[34:26.67]Whatever.
[34:26.99]Alright, let's hibernate.
[34:40.00]This is my house.
[34:40.74]Get out of here.
[34:44.02]He can't come up here, can he?
[34:54.61]Alright, so now we level up again.
[34:58.12]What is this?
[34:58.46]I thought you were going to play Wayne's World.
[35:02.00]No, I tried to play another game that I got annoyed by.
[35:04.50]And then everyone was... Jumping on... Like, five people told me to play this.
[35:12.08]And I was like, alright, this game's kind of cool.
[35:13.66]And then... And then... But you can't hear me right, because I don't know why this game is so loud.
[35:21.56]Why is it so loud and then so quiet?
[35:26.12]Alright, let's keep going.
[35:26.86]Where do I go from here?
[35:30.22]Just anywhere, right?
[35:31.20]Doesn't matter.
[35:31.60]Should I keep going right?
[35:42.84]I feel like there's something over there.
[35:46.90]There's food down here.
[35:56.19]Get over here.
[35:56.57]Did I get it?
[35:57.15]Nice.
[35:57.31]Eat it.
[35:58.07]Is this a pack of cigarettes?
[36:02.58]What the fuck is that?
[36:04.86]What?
[36:11.50]Eat him.
[36:13.42]Okay.
[36:17.35]Holy shit, there's a lot of food over here.
[36:26.27]We're gonna get back over this way.
[36:30.35]You are also food.
[36:51.62]Exhibit A.
[37:07.45]Cycle three, outskirts.
[37:10.75]Cycle three.
[37:14.99]You are also food.
[37:16.45]Yes, I am.
[37:17.49]Let's go eat.
[37:25.02]Fill up.
[37:30.42]You don't want a bat?
[37:31.16]What?
[37:34.64]Fill up, and I'm going right back to fucking bed again.
[37:42.64]Eat it.
[37:45.18]Watch out for that weird lizard snake thing.
[38:01.77]Don't wake him up.
[38:02.95]I feel like I'm playing Oddworld.
[38:08.94]Alright, back to bed.
[38:16.26]Alright, where's the shelter?
[38:16.96]It's down?
[38:24.59]Should I just go back up?
[38:25.43]No, I could go all the way down.
[38:28.27]You know what?
[38:32.21]Down and to the left.
[38:33.33]That's like far away, though.
[38:34.53]Might as well just go right and then up.
[38:40.56]Or I've already eaten enough food.
[38:41.52]Alright, let's just go back.
[38:56.01]No, let's go down.
[38:56.73]Down, down, down, down, down.
[39:01.07]I've been up here for a long time.
[39:02.45]Let's go down again.
[39:04.33]Okay, we're going to go down.
[39:18.82]And then when I come out, I'm going to go right and then down.
[39:25.92]I'm fully fed.
[39:26.72]Alright, let's go to sleep.
[39:32.99]Close my door.
[39:33.67]Close the window.
[39:47.32]Wait, what?
[39:54.68]Evolve?
[40:08.77]Okay.
[40:17.70]So I'm gonna go all the way right.
[40:23.60]There is no evolving.
[40:24.52]Slugcat is a perfect being.
[40:26.42]Alright, where do I want to go?
[40:33.32]I want to go down this way.
[40:34.50]So we're going to go up, right, and then down.
[40:41.09]Why is this bigger?
[40:42.09]Wait, what are you doing?
[40:44.25]You're showing me like a movie.
[40:55.02]He's still going.
[40:55.76]Yeah, I said today was going to be longer.
[41:00.74]Can I go down from here?
[41:09.01]I guess I can't go down.
[41:13.59]Where does this take me if I go up?
[41:19.95]I can't go down?
[41:27.03]Shit.
[41:27.69]Okay.
[41:40.28]I'll keep going right.
[41:41.72]I got stuffed last time.
[41:47.53]Right, and then right again, and then right.
[41:49.19]I was gonna go right until I can't go right anymore.
[41:56.24]Uh, don't get killed by... Oh, fuck.
[41:59.94]Just run away.
[42:08.34]Why are there two of them now?
[42:09.16]Alright.
[42:14.86]Oh.
[42:18.28]The game is really quiet?
[42:19.42]Yeah, it's unfortunate because the game is really quiet, and then when I get bit, it goes to five million decibels.
[42:38.09]Okay, this is where I ended up last time and I freaked out.
[42:40.29]Because there was like a giant mosquito over here last time.
[42:51.24]Yeah, we gotta go right and then up.
[42:53.21]So here we go.
[42:57.47]Can I eventually eat the giant mosquito?
[42:58.97]Alright, I gotta go where he is.
[43:03.17]He doesn't know where I am, right?
[43:04.01]Like, how do I get in there?
[43:11.93]Actually, anything will do in here.
[43:16.03]I have a stick.
[43:26.22]I gotta get this stick to stick on there.
[43:35.00]I'm gonna kill him.
[43:36.65]Should I throw it at him?
[43:50.18]Can I get this to stick right here?
[43:51.78]Shit.
[44:02.06]If I jump, no.
[44:03.05]I want to try to get it.
[44:03.69]Not going to happen.
[44:06.33]Because I can't, like, get up here.
[44:10.87]Wait, how did you do that?
[44:13.75]Wait, how do you do that?
[44:22.13]hey thanks for the tip and let's get in here okay this is new now this is how you get up here and then I'm gonna go up
[44:55.54]Can't grab this?
[44:57.28]No?
[45:05.91]Wait, can I go in here?
[45:06.83]Oh, alright.
[45:10.45]This goes all the way up.
[45:23.29]Get in there.
[45:25.12]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[45:28.12]That's not what I wanted to do.
[45:34.55]Is there even a way to go?
[45:35.53]No, this is like the top of the world.
[45:37.23]There's nothing even over here.
[45:44.43]There's nothing in here, right?
[45:51.39]No, there's nothing here.
[46:01.58]No, I can't do anything about this.
[46:03.54]I gotta go.
[46:07.42]Like, let's go.
[46:08.26]Right now.
[46:17.81]Okay, go.
[46:18.63]Go.
[46:19.09]I need to find a shelter for the rain now.
[46:20.65]I haven't even eaten.

[47:53.02]Oh, come on.
[47:55.50]Ugh!
[48:28.24]Okay, now I actually have to eat a ton of stuff.
[48:33.26]So this is the final point before I go another way?
[48:36.12]The survivor.
[48:36.84]Alright, I gotta go to... I thought I was in uncharted territory, but apparently not.
[48:48.95]Where do I go?
[48:51.31]All the way left?
[48:55.43]All the way down?
[48:58.55]I'm going to say left.
[49:02.87]I need to eat food on the way there, though, before it's a disaster.
[49:07.22]Nothing?
[49:08.56]No bugs or anything I can eat?
[49:12.52]Alright.
[49:14.88]Left.
[49:16.59]Okay, I haven't been all the way down.
[49:18.15]Alright, we're going to just go left, all the way left, left, left, left, left.
[49:21.25]Bottom left.
[49:33.84]Get away from me.
[49:34.62]Get away from me.
[49:35.18]Get away from me.
[49:50.39]What?
[49:51.15]That just stunned him.
[49:53.15]Alright, move.
[49:54.43]Is he going up or down or around?
[49:55.95]He's going... What is he doing?
[49:58.24]Oh, fuck.
[49:59.44]I'm going to do that too.
[50:13.99]Hello?
[50:14.47]What?
[50:14.99]Why do I have my hand?
[50:20.91]Oh.
[50:36.50]No!
[50:45.97]Give me another kid!
[50:49.74]Where the fuck am I?
[51:18.35]Where am I?
[51:20.79]Ah!
[51:21.91]Oh!
[51:59.06]Can I die?
[52:00.46]Okay.
[52:02.58]In the vent.
[52:04.14]Can that thing kill me in a vent?
[52:07.08]I feel like it could have.
[52:07.90]That's why I was freaking out.
[52:09.76]Yes, yes, it can.
[52:10.66]Okay, yeah, of course it can.
[52:21.53]Alright, same deal.
[52:23.11]That's a cool move.
[52:23.59]Let's go.
[52:29.63]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[52:35.20]I went two screens.
[52:36.32]I know.
[52:39.86]I know.
[52:40.14]I know.
[52:44.44]I know.
[52:49.87]Can I eat those weird mushrooms?
[52:53.39]Alright, where am I?
[52:53.97]Something over there on the left.
[52:57.55]What's this?
[52:58.11]Is it food over here?
[53:00.92]Can I eat this?
[53:13.46]Wait, what?
[53:21.63]What's the food that's right here?
[53:24.45]Bones or something?
[53:25.19]I don't understand.
[53:26.77]What is here?
[53:33.12]What does the bones mean?
[53:37.26]Is food on the floor?
[53:38.34]I don't see anything.
[53:51.23]You died here.
[53:53.89]Oh.
[53:55.77]Okay.
[53:56.61]Wait.
[54:01.97]No, forget it.
[54:22.62]Bat's in here.
[54:26.38]Double bat snack.
[54:28.84]Nice.
[54:29.12]Okay, I just need one more.
[54:33.78]I don't know what this G thing is.
[54:35.52]Let's go all the way up and left.
[54:42.66]What is that indicator for?
[54:43.52]Hmm.
[54:53.39]Can I...
[55:03.02]Can't get in there?
[55:38.31]My hands hurt.
[55:42.39]And this doesn't do anything.
[55:43.11]I can't eat this either, right?
[55:55.96]There's one spot to go over here.
[56:00.98]Can I go anywhere else from here?
[56:04.48]Blink.
[56:04.76]I already did.
[56:28.38]I'll just eat.
[56:32.36]I have eaten completely.
[56:33.45]Maybe I should just sleep.
[56:43.35]I missed one to the left.
[56:47.96]Go down.
[56:55.59]Eat and then sleep.
[56:57.25]Eat and then sleep.
[57:05.84]Is this just a shelter, right here?
[57:08.32]Well, um... God, there's berries over there, though.
[57:14.94]Where the hell am I going?
[57:16.20]Um... What is... What is that?
[57:27.20]It's like a villain vine.
[57:28.96]Don't touch that.
[57:31.36]That's like an evil vine.
[57:33.45]Don't eat it.
[57:37.75]Can I buy it?
[57:42.78]Should I let these two fight or something?
[58:28.06]Uh... Is this a dead end?
[58:31.00]What's this one?
[58:44.57]Also a dead end?
[58:50.47]You gotta hurry.
[58:51.05]Oh, fuck.
[58:52.67]Alright, I know there's something down here, though.
[58:54.37]Alright, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[58:59.43]Um, but is that thing gonna, is this thing alive?
[59:02.81]This thing looks, it's alive, isn't it?
[59:10.09]Get out of the fucking way, man.
[59:13.01]Get out of the fucking way.
[59:18.37]Go get, fight each other or something.
[59:22.03]Go down there and start getting attacked and run away.
[59:25.49]Run.
[59:26.37]Out.
[59:27.27]Out.
[59:28.05]Out.
[59:28.69]Get out of the way.
[59:29.97]Oh, come on.
[59:30.65]Get out of the way.
[59:43.48]What?
[59:45.34]What?
[59:46.18]I grabbed it before.
[59:48.96]I grabbed it before and it didn't do anything.
[59:53.18]I just lost fucking points for that.
[59:59.24]Can I get off of that?
[59:59.95]Yeah, that was horrible.
[60:04.57]Alright, let's do it again.
[60:10.81]Same place.
[60:11.27]I want to go to the same place.
[60:12.05]But that fucking stupid lizard didn't go like this way, that way, this way, that way, this way, that way, this way, that way, this way.
[60:17.54]I would have been fine.
[60:32.05]He was scared of the vine.
[60:33.50]He eventually did it.
[60:40.10]Otto, this way, that way.
[60:45.11]That's very cute.
[60:46.61]What a cute dog.
[60:49.39]Alright.
[60:50.41]Again, all the way to the left.
[60:53.41]And then we go... Down...
[61:00.62]This way, that way, this way, that way, this way, that way.
[61:09.08]Can't get into G. Alright, it's tempting, but don't do it.
[61:21.94]Just got to go down.
[61:41.83]I want to eat a berry.
[61:49.09]Eat.
[61:50.95]Stand up and eat.
[61:52.23]What are you doing?
[62:08.65]Eat.
[62:08.85]Where's the other one?
[62:12.47]It was over there.
[63:01.47]Helter.
[63:01.97]Alright.
[63:02.21]Give me a couple of bats.
[63:04.87]Hey, but wait.
[63:08.83]I'm good.
[63:09.21]I can explore.
[63:11.45]I want to eat a couple of bats.
[63:20.28]Bats.
[63:28.74]Oh, come here.
[63:29.30]Just wait.
[63:29.68]They'll come back out.
[63:30.82]I wasn't even ready for it.
[63:32.40]I wasn't even ready for that when it came out.
[63:34.00]I wasn't even ready.
[63:45.04]Did I let you go?
[63:46.14]What am I... Fishing?
[63:49.11]Oh, fuck.
[63:50.19]You got it.
[63:51.37]You...
[64:31.54]Alright, let's get back.
[64:36.00]What is this thing?
[64:36.42]Is this evil?
[64:44.36]That looks like an evil plant.
[64:46.73]It is.
[64:48.97]It is evil.
[64:51.69]Okay.
[64:58.05]I'm going to bed.
[65:00.97]Get me out.
[65:11.23]So I gotta go... It was down... Where was it?
[65:15.79]Down to the right.
[65:17.95]Watch out, this... Alright, get me in here.
[65:26.49]Shalta.
[65:27.05]Nice.
[65:27.53]Shalta.
[65:34.44]Watch out for the vine.
[65:35.52]Alright, well now at least I get to go back up where I was.
[65:48.97]Hold on.
[65:49.59]I have to crack my chest.
[65:55.63]What do we think of this game?
[65:57.65]It's fun.
[65:58.31]It's good.
[66:05.05]It's very, very interesting.
[66:06.59]It's very fun.
[66:12.04]Alright, now I want to go... I want to go down.
[66:18.03]Wait, somebody said there was an evil vine down here.
[66:19.91]Oh my god, it was this one.
[66:30.24]How do I go down?
[66:33.57]Can I go down from here?
[66:34.39]I don't think I can go down from here.
[66:37.49]Oh, I hate this thing.
[66:53.63]Can I go down here?
[66:55.91]No, no, no, no.
[66:56.79]Don't.
[66:57.17]Don't even.
[66:57.69]Come on.
[66:58.95]Really?
[66:59.69]Really?
[66:59.91]You're gonna dump through two alligators on me?
[67:04.28]I gotta go through this.
[67:04.88]Okay, there's berries here.
[67:10.52]What is that thing?
[67:11.83]What the hell is that?
[67:14.89]Why are they doing this?
[67:15.47]Is it a snake?
[67:33.64]I'm going down.
[67:38.86]Where am I?
[67:39.12]Oh.
[67:39.56]Uh, there's a weird beetle coming over here.
[67:47.96]Alright, I got full, uh... I got full food.
[68:04.35]Where is this?
[68:04.89]I'm going to go down.
[68:15.97]It's just water.
[68:16.57]It's fine.
[68:25.79]Right up.
[68:55.46]Huh?
[68:58.46]Sandbox item unlocked.
[69:02.28]Sandbox item?
[69:08.94]New arenas unlocked.
[69:22.41]Hello?
[69:22.63]What was that?
[69:37.40]Open the door.
[69:38.20]Open.
[69:38.82]Open the door?
[69:41.14]Open.
[69:42.20]Open, open, open, open.
[69:56.41]Drainage system.
[70:13.34]Wink.
[70:29.94]Why am I going over here to swim with this guy?
[70:32.22]Hold on.
[70:35.24]I hear Otto.
[70:36.90]I think I have to go talk to Otto.
[70:38.31]Otto is like... Okay, let me go get Otto.
[70:44.16]Am I dead?
[70:48.92]Why can I not go in there anymore?
[70:51.87]Wait, what?
[70:52.43]I... Hold on.
[70:53.87]Let me go get Otto.
[70:54.69]I'll be right back.
[71:31.39]So you can drown.
[71:32.39]You can drown.
[71:33.13]I guess I am an animal.
[71:42.50]It makes sense.
[71:44.86]Cho, Otto?
[71:45.72]Hey.
[71:46.58]Hey, you.
[71:48.02]You want to be on camera?
[71:51.68]Please read important.
[71:52.44]The sewer is... You're going the wrong way.
[71:57.08]This is not the way you...
[72:01.08]Wait, what if I'm going the wrong way?
[72:02.38]Hold on.
[72:03.74]Fuck, I'm going back down again.
[72:05.60]That's an optional hard area.
[72:07.44]Alright.
[72:09.48]You want to be on camera?
[72:10.12]Hold on.
[72:38.55]He doesn't want to be on camera.
[72:39.67]He wants to go outside.
[72:42.27]He's like, I didn't want to come in here, dude.
[72:45.47]He's like, I wanted you to take me out.
[72:46.59]He's like, get me out of here.
[72:54.09]Get me out of here.
[72:54.93]He wants to go outside.
[72:59.93]I'll be right back.
[77:04.10]He also wanted some food.
[77:05.28]So I gave him some food.
[77:09.24]He's just down there having a good time with Otto.
[77:11.45]I just drowned too, didn't I?
[77:24.43]Did I devolve again?
[77:25.35]I did, didn't I?
[77:36.57]On a scale of... This way, that way, this way.
[77:39.21]Oh my fucking god, I wouldn't even... And that concludes the super stream!
[77:44.27]I'm done!
[77:44.91]Damn it!
[77:47.61]Oh, it's evolved again.
[77:56.76]Fuck!
[77:56.86]Oh, come on.
[78:02.28]That was the best 20 minutes ever.
[78:05.74]Fuck.
[78:06.48]No.
[78:08.23]Alright, one more try.
[78:09.13]What are you doing in here?
[78:26.02]Get out of here.
[78:26.48]This is... We both did the same thing.
[78:30.10]Are we both streaming the same time?

[78:34.66]He's afraid of me.
[78:35.18]Wait, he's afraid of me.
[78:35.72]He's afraid of me.
[78:36.14]Can I kill him?
[78:37.79]He's afraid of me.

[81:18.92]I was trying to crack my ribs.
[81:32.93]God dammit, why does my rib cage have to suck?
[81:37.84]What's wrong with him?
[81:40.07]I'm trying to like... Push my red cage so I go... Fuck.
[81:46.44]Hold on.
[82:16.68]Alright.
[82:17.56]I have auto step on it.
[82:21.60]That's not going to work.
[82:22.69]Okay.
[82:24.79]Alright.
[82:27.61]For those of you that don't know what's happening.
[82:31.09]So I have costochondritis and sometimes it fucking really, really hurts like in here and like back here.
[82:41.00]So if I
[82:47.25]We're good!
[82:47.59]Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.
[82:57.23]It's a real pain in the ass.
[82:58.45]You just got diagnosed with that, too.
[82:59.59]Are you serious?
[83:02.78]It sucks.
[83:04.04]It's a real... I'm not touching the flower.
[83:15.12]Where do I want to go from here?
[83:18.72]Can I go up from this way?
[83:40.66]I'm gonna call it.
[83:42.22]I'm gonna call it here.
[83:47.98]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[83:50.75]So I can stretch and move around.
[83:52.43]Probably take a bath.
[83:55.59]Yeah, I don't want to push it.
[83:57.79]You know, if I'm sitting down.
[83:59.89]Fuck.
[84:03.57]You want to do stretching with Jerma?
[84:06.37]There we go.
[84:06.75]Ready?
[84:11.44]Okay.
[84:13.46]I'm not sweaty.
[84:14.68]Okay.
[84:19.68]Okay, that feels good.
[84:24.40]Sweaty yoga.
[84:29.52]If I push my chest out like this, it feels better.
[84:37.07]That felt pretty good.
[84:38.07]Did that feel good for you guys, chat?
[84:41.47]Do a full screen?
[84:42.47]No, I'm so disgusting right now.
[84:43.97]Alright, ready?
[85:03.60]You know what actually feels really great?
[85:05.74]Is if I bear hug myself and, like, squeeze... Pimple on nose.
[85:22.83]Oh, I'm hugging you guys!
[85:25.11]Come over here!
[85:31.09]Ugh.
[85:31.23]Okay.
[85:34.03]Yeah, yeah.
[85:36.53]As much as I want to stick around for another hour or so.
[85:39.51]I'm going to call it here.
[85:42.01]I'll call it here.
[85:42.69]I'll call it.
[85:43.27]I got to take care of my fucking body.
[85:45.71]Drink plenty of water.
[85:52.71]Okay.
[85:54.81]Yeah, I think it's... You know what it is?
[85:58.03]Maybe it's the way I'm... I don't have my fucking boomer brace on.
[86:06.79]Idiot.
[86:08.03]Fucking idiot.
[86:12.04]I'm not wearing my boomer bracelet.
[86:13.30]I'm sitting here for eight and a half hours.
[86:14.58]What the fuck am I thinking?
[86:16.58]Actual idiot.
[86:18.14]Rookie mistake.
[86:20.34]Yeah, we'll slow it down here.
[86:21.68]We'll call it here.
[86:23.49]I'll be live tomorrow with either Mega Man Legends or Nintendo Wii.
[86:34.13]Last stream ever.
[86:35.21]That's not true.
[86:43.06]uh no more heroes is on the table but I kind of want to play the bachelor I could keep playing this too tomorrow maybe we could start with uh this or start with the wii or something because this game is actually pretty fun
[87:10.42]Rain World and then The Bachelor.
[87:22.53]Two quality games.
[87:28.31]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[87:30.67]Tomorrow we're going to start at the normal time.
[87:34.09]So we're not starting at noon tomorrow.
[87:35.91]We'll be starting around 2.
[87:40.15]Thanks for sticking around.
[87:41.39]I'm glad at least I got to sit here for at least eight and a half hours.
[87:43.75]A little more because we're doing the end of the stream, so.
[87:46.66]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[87:49.44]I'm going to say this will be nine hours.
[87:52.24]Nine hours.
[87:52.64]Something like that.
[87:56.42]Have a great night, guys.
[87:57.06]See you tomorrow.
[87:59.16]Take care of yourselves.
[88:00.00]Fucking stretch and wear a boomer brace if you need to.
[88:06.71]Nine hour streams of fun.
[88:08.03]Yeah, I just... I really should have been wearing this.
[88:10.39]It really crept up on me.
[88:11.39]The last, like, 40 minutes.
[88:13.27]It was okay, but it really just... I don't know.
[88:16.74]It just fucking crept up on me pretty hard here in the last, like, 20 minutes.
[88:20.86]Don't know why.
[88:22.86]What's this called?
[88:23.32]It's called costochondritis.
[88:24.66]I have inflammation in my ribcage that connects where my sternum connects in my chest and on my spine.
[88:33.62]It's a beauty.
[88:41.90]But I was getting to the end anyways.
[88:45.09]I probably wasn't going to stream for more than another 30, 40 minutes in that game.
[88:47.63]So it's all good.
[88:49.39]I'm good to go.
[88:49.73]Alright.
[88:52.19]What do you say?
[88:54.49]Let's do the bits and the subs and all that great stuff.
[88:57.30]All the support you guys give the stream.
[88:58.92]Thank you, guys.
[89:09.11]Do I?
[89:09.57]Where's my stream?
[89:11.25]Let's go.
[89:11.87]Open it up.
[89:14.02]But we'll see you tomorrow.
[89:17.42]I'm gonna go take a nice hot bath and then an immediate cold bath.
[89:20.90]It'll be awesome.
[89:31.11]What a freak.
[89:38.53]That sounds like hell.
[89:42.07]Cold plunge.
[89:43.87]Dual welding bath.
[89:47.43]He's tempering himself.
[89:52.45]Hey, I am a pain.
[89:53.33]Thanks for the 250.
[89:55.55]Hot wheels.
[89:56.19]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[89:58.07]Jerm, I've been lurking for years, but finally subbed for two months.
[90:01.28]Two months ago.
[90:02.40]Thank you for that.
[90:04.28]And I wanted to give you some bits and tell you that you've been a significant part of my teenage years.
[90:08.86]On Friday, I had an interview at Universal Studios to work with the film studio.
[90:13.28]It's the job of my dreams.
[90:15.54]I find out if I get the job next week, and I just wanted you to know that you got me through some of the hardest moments of my life.
[90:21.08]Thanks, Jerma.
[90:22.71]That's pretty awesome.
[90:24.57]Hot Wheels, that sounds like an awesome job.
[90:26.91]Hopefully you get it.
[90:30.75]Good luck to you.
[90:35.65]We got a movie star coming up potentially here.
[90:39.22]Seriously, though.
[90:41.50]I wish you the best of luck.
[90:44.42]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[90:49.18]Autumn Dragons, thanks for the 250.
[90:50.78]Hi, Jerma.
[90:51.16]I'm getting back into the Mega Man series after nearly a decade, and I can't wait to watch you stream Mega Man Legends, be it tomorrow or today.
[90:58.36]And now a question for you.
[91:00.12]Okay.
[91:02.51]How much of the many Mega Man series are you into?
[91:06.99]Of
[91:08.84]Mega Man X is the only one I really actually played, if I'm going to be completely honest.
[91:13.68]Mega Man X is really... Mega Man X and Mega Man X2.
[91:16.65]The ones for Super Nintendo are the only ones that I really cared about.
[91:21.37]I played the original one or two or three of them for the regular Nintendo.
[91:27.05]But once I got past two or three, I was just done.
[91:31.06]I was just like, ah, that was fun.
[91:34.42]And then Mega Man X came out.
[91:36.86]And I really got into that.
[91:40.40]I played Mega Man Legends, too, as well.
[91:44.01]Regular Nintendo versus the Super Nintendo, that's right.
[91:50.97]Yeah.
[91:53.39]Not aware I left off.
[91:57.25]Wembley, thanks for the 250 Jerm.
[91:59.28]I've been playing the 500 sub video before working out to get me pumped up for lifting.
[92:04.44]It's a good video to do, too.
[92:07.18]Any good tips for working out?
[92:10.77]Not anymore.
[92:11.37]And I feel like people probably have so much better stuff to say about lifting than I do now.
[92:17.28]Because I just haven't done it in so long.
[92:18.78]I've been out of that for like seven plus years at this point, truly.
[92:25.18]So I don't really have any advice for it anymore.
[92:30.92]Just eat balanced food.
[92:32.86]Eat a balanced diet.
[92:34.48]And... Don't eat tahini paste every day like I did.
[92:39.62]It's not good for you.
[92:40.32]I mean, it is good for you, but not in high amount of quantities.
[92:45.49]Thank you, though.
[92:46.77]Good luck on your workout journey.
[92:50.61]Curbumble, thanks for the 500 bits.
[92:54.04]Will you be able to give any kind of heads up for the GameCube stream?
[92:56.46]I really want to make sure I don't miss you playing Gachiforce.
[92:59.22]And I still can't believe you even know that exists.
[93:02.44]Uh, yeah, that's... I will make it very clear what I'm going to be playing.
[93:08.46]Because Chibi-Robo and Gachiforce are going to be back-to-back, probably.
[93:12.84]And then, of course, I've got Super Mario Sunshine, too.
[93:20.74]That is the case.
[93:24.99]I can't wait for GB Robo, man.
[93:27.71]That's gonna be so much fun.
[93:30.89]I don't even know if I'm gonna like that game, but I'm gonna play it.
[93:33.89]And it was a ton of money.
[93:37.85]We'll see.
[93:40.71]But yeah, I'll definitely let you guys know when I'm gonna be doing the GameCube streams.
[93:44.64]It'll probably be... Probably either next weekend or the week after that.
[93:53.73]Like the week of that, like the 24th, 25th, maybe.
[93:56.84]Because still, I have a couple things planned for the next few days.
[94:01.48]We'll see.
[94:04.18]All of one zombie thanks to the 250.
[94:05.36]Have you ever considered, instead of a wink, you could read popsicle stick caliber jokes?
[94:10.49]That wouldn't require the webcam.
[94:11.95]I'd buy a joke book so you don't die of a heart attack after three months.
[94:17.45]Somebody also suggested you read a line from a children's book.
[94:27.63]Just have jokes open?
[94:28.97]Well, yeah.
[94:30.41]That's a pretty good idea.
[94:33.44]But then I'm going to get a shitload of -2.
[94:35.34]It's the shit I didn't even say.
[94:38.24]If I read popsicle stick jokes, people are going to -2 every time it happens.
[94:44.38]See?
[94:44.70]They're already doing it.
[94:45.54]I didn't even do anything.
[94:47.95]Well, that's the joke.
[94:49.11]Ah, fine.
[94:51.91]I'll do some research on that.
[94:53.07]I'm going to be farming minus twos, yeah.
[94:58.64]Apple Shift, thanks for the $2.50.
[94:59.97]Hey, what's your favorite accent to hear and favorite accent to do?
[95:03.85]Favorite accent to hear is Irish, and favorite accent to do is Irish.
[95:11.72]Done.
[95:14.02]Also, happy late Valentine's Day.
[95:15.66]Thank you, Apple Shift.
[95:18.48]I appreciate it.
[95:20.62]Happy Valentine's Day to you, too.
[95:22.97]It's too bad you suck at it.
[95:23.99]I really don't.
[95:28.10]sometimes I do but like for instance right now it's it's not very bad it's it is pretty bad but it's been eight and a half hours uh almost nine hours that's not even bad that's fine that's not even bad that's not bad that's not very bad that was good that sounded like I came right from Ireland
[95:53.98]A nondescript civilian, thanks for the thousand bits.
[95:55.94]Bravely default OST, please.
[95:58.74]Maybe next time?
[96:04.71]Ireland, Missouri.
[96:05.85]What the fuck?
[96:09.01]Ow.
[96:14.07]Fuck, hold on.
[96:17.27]Okay.
[96:18.48]Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[96:19.86]I hope one of the 20 games you bought is Bowser's Inside Story.
[96:22.62]Sorry to tell you, it's not...
[96:24.98]In all seriousness, though, have you ever... Are you ever going to stream an RPG in the future?
[96:30.12]I have Chrono Trigger installed.
[96:31.49]If you remember... Three or four months ago, I talked about how I wanted to play that.
[96:38.05]I remember after Mario RPG, it was like, what would you do next?
[96:40.15]And I was like, well... Chrono Trigger is one of my favorite games ever made.
[96:47.06]And then I saw Vinny was playing it.
[96:48.52]And I was like, well, great minds fucking think alike.
[96:51.80]Great minds have 500 IQ together.
[96:55.40]Remember when I was playing Diablo II and he came over, he was like, oh, this is like my favorite game ever.
[96:58.35]Well, yeah, like brilliant, fucking incredibly, incredible minds think alike.
[97:18.23]You like Chrono Trigger, but not Final Fantasy.
[97:22.28]Great minds also click 13.8 clicks per second.
[97:25.25]Yeah.
[97:34.05]Oh, you motherfuckers.
[97:35.07]I forgot about that.
[97:36.03]It's been a long stream.
[97:37.09]It's been kind of a long day.
[97:38.09]I forgot that that happened.
[97:41.55]That was like I was going against somebody streaming my face and shit.
[97:47.60]And they were beating me.
[97:49.26]Oh, that was wild.
[97:53.03]A whole of one zombie.
[97:54.07]Thanks for the $2.50.
[97:54.71]I tried eating some raw tahini.
[97:56.77]It tastes like sand.
[97:57.77]You think the beach tastes like hummus?
[98:02.95]Why would you eat raw tahini?
[98:05.39]Unless you were trying to do the dumb thing I was doing.
[98:08.47]Which is not smart and you shouldn't do it.
[98:14.67]Jerma13, thanks for the 250 bits.
[98:17.71]985, we've got a problem.
[98:20.82]The old warehouse has been reactivated, presumably by a malicious actor, and the defective models have gone missing.
[98:27.06]Commissioner Jerma3 wants to see you in for some questions by Wednesday.
[98:31.78]And yes, this likely means that Jerma65 is back online and is already planning his next move.
[98:39.79]Oh.
[98:42.67]That doesn't sound good.
[98:44.48]That does not sound good.
[98:49.26]It's okay, though.
[98:54.26]I am the 905th.
[98:56.36]985th iteration of this thing.
[99:00.36]I've got fucking all kinds of, like, I've got laser fingers and shit.
[99:04.24]He doesn't have that.
[99:04.84]I'll be fine.
[99:08.59]He programmed it with one eye.
[99:10.55]So, I got two of those.
[99:13.40]I'll be okay.
[99:13.88]We're going to be fine.
[99:14.46]Don't worry.
[99:15.96]Dermot13, again, thanks for the 250.
[99:18.44]Additionally, we have reason to believe that Model 65 has been retrofitted with the experimental JEX module that was designed for you.
[99:24.20]Well, now you've got me a little bit concerned.
[99:26.50]And is now posing an even more serious threat.
[99:28.50]We need to act fast.
[99:29.83]Hope we can rely on your help.
[99:30.91]13 out.
[99:34.53]Well, why did you guys let this happen?
[99:42.04]The fuck are you guys doing over there?
[99:48.16]Good luck.
[99:48.98]Hey, Reaper, thanks for the 250.
[99:49.92]Hey, Jerma, this paperclip game is too boring that I actually fell asleep for an hour.
[99:53.95]I just woke up and I can see that I missed nothing.
[99:57.23]You missed me.
[99:58.23]Come on.
[99:59.09]Whatever.
[99:59.67]Thank you.
[100:01.59]Hey, Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[100:03.21]Jerma, I got some good news.
[100:04.15]I got affiliate.
[100:06.79]Sick!
[100:08.23]It only took me a month or so.
[100:11.16]And yesterday, when you didn't stream, I did, and I got nine fucking subs!
[100:15.52]First day on affiliate!
[100:16.58]Fuck yeah!
[100:16.94]I wanna say thanks to the chat members who supported me.
[100:19.77]You guys are awesome, and thank you, Jerma, as well, for inspiring me.
[100:22.09]Who knows?
[100:22.61]I may rival you someday.
[100:24.01]Well, let's fucking go!
[100:24.87]Bring it on!
[100:26.65]Okay, I can't yell anymore.
[100:27.51]That, like, hurt.
[100:35.87]The oh and on just, like, hurt my back.
[100:41.47]I'm alright.
[100:42.37]I just want, you know, sometimes, you know, sometimes I just want to just go into the dryer and turn it on.
[100:48.83]You know what I mean?
[100:49.31]Like, maybe I'll feel better when I get out.
[100:50.61]Like, just like, ah, I feel good.
[100:55.62]That was a good dryer therapy.
[101:01.18]Uh, but good luck, Hayley.
[101:02.08]That's, um, that's pretty sick.
[101:05.36]Nice work.
[101:10.64]RNG Physical Therapy.
[101:11.82]Yeah, I got another appointment to go to.
[101:16.50]I have another appointment to go to.
[101:18.96]I'm doing PT twice a week now, so... Yeah.
[101:25.54]Let's hope it works.
[101:35.91]Thank you, Hayley, for the $2.50.
[101:38.56]Thank you, Wembley TTV.
[101:40.16]Thanks for the $2.50.
[101:40.72]If you always wanted, you can go into a money exchange and ask for the Iranian Rial, the Venezuelan Sovereign Bolivar, and remember to get a few wheelbarrows to take the money home.
[101:55.87]I don't think they have those.
[101:56.91]Just in your local bank.
[102:00.40]Do they?
[102:00.74]Guys, I'm not even sure they carry Canadian.
[102:08.00]Some of them do, maybe.
[102:10.52]Hey, Peter, thanks for the... Oh, the inflation thing.
[102:12.40]Right, yeah, that's right, that's right.
[102:13.80]Hey, Peter, thanks for the 300 bits.
[102:15.12]They say, cool guy.
[102:16.58]Back at it again, cool guy.
[102:18.04]Thank you, Peter.
[102:21.14]Uh, Itachi, thanks for the 300 bits.
[102:23.34]No message, just 300 bits.
[102:25.28]Five community subs from Peter.
[102:27.51]Thanks for the subs, Peter.
[102:30.71]20 community subs.
[102:31.29]We caught it earlier from Morkus Borkus.
[102:32.85]Thank you, Morkus.
[102:35.07]Thousand bits from Mr. Him.
[102:36.85]Thanks for the 10 bucks, Mr. Him.
[102:41.27]Money from my favorite E-clan.
[102:42.71]Love you, Jerma.
[102:43.25]Thank you.
[102:47.14]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[102:50.78]Juge Rotter.
[102:53.86]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[102:54.78]They say hi.
[102:55.62]Thanks for the five dollars.
[102:56.50]Hi back to you, Juge Rotter.
[102:59.17]Juge Rotter.
[103:04.85]Alright.
[103:10.83]Mr. Him gave $5 on top of the $10.
[103:12.69]Thank you, Mr. Him.
[103:18.06]Appreciate that.
[103:20.36]Hey, Many Rabbits.
[103:22.66]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[103:23.96]Appreciate it, Many Rabbits.
[103:27.10]My best friend from college was sent back to Brazil after I graduated.
[103:30.04]We got into contact again three years later.
[103:32.52]In our first conversation after three years, we found that we both were on your stream together for months without knowing it.
[103:38.54]One of the most surreal and happy coincidences I've experienced in my life.
[103:43.10]Thank you for so many hours of pure joy.
[103:44.74]Holy shit, that's awesome.
[103:48.26]It's given me the capability of changing my life for the better since then.
[103:51.35]You're a great entertainer and a wonderful person.
[103:53.35]That's really, really... That's really awesome.
[103:57.76]That's so weird.
[103:58.74]I can't imagine how fucking weird that would be.
[104:00.72]Imagine just like... That's pretty cool.
[104:05.69]Thanks, Money Rabbits, and whoever your friend is.
[104:09.79]Thanks to them, too.
[104:10.35]Appreciate it.
[104:20.30]Gooberry Juice, thanks for the $2.50.
[104:21.36]Jerma, here are the scores currently of people racing you.
[104:28.36]Oh, I already won.
[104:30.74]Well, did I win?
[104:31.28]How many of you guys were playing this when I was playing it?
[104:37.75]Poseidon Shadow has about 50 million.
[104:40.13]Beat that person.
[104:41.85]If he's best, he wasn't racing you.
[104:43.45]He was figuring out Windows 2000.
[104:44.85]Okay.
[104:47.71]Fluffy Dragon would have beaten you, but his computer froze.
[104:51.19]He still might beat you.
[104:53.25]Hexerman, about 20 million and going.
[104:55.19]You got this.
[104:57.05]Roju, 150 quadrillion.
[104:58.31]Pog, Redski, 300,000.
[104:58.55]Don't give up.
[104:59.17]What?
[105:12.46]Hey, Tingy, thanks for the $2.50.
[105:14.14]Last month's Cheez-It was finally brought to Canada.
[105:16.48]Wait, you just didn't have Cheez-Its?
[105:18.78]So I bought a box to try them, and they were better than I expected.
[105:21.90]I always thought that you were over-exaggerating, but they really are better than any cheese-flavored cracker.
[105:25.68]Yeah.
[105:27.02]Welcome to the dark side.
[105:36.55]They never were in Canada?
[105:37.69]That's weird.
[105:41.74]That is really weird.
[105:42.48]Why?
[105:42.70]I feel like they should be.
[105:43.96]I feel like they would be.
[105:48.12]Hey, Jules.
[105:48.94]Thanks for the 250, Jules.
[105:51.89]And they say... Hey, Jerma.
[105:55.13]My brother said that while he was watching one of your streams a long time ago, you said your name originated from you not washing your hands after using the toilet.
[106:02.42]The toilet handle and your privates are for the germs, hence the name Jerma.
[106:05.08]Please tell me this isn't true.
[106:16.45]Typical, tip, what is it?
[106:17.73]Older brother?
[106:18.13]Is it an older brother?
[106:20.60]Typical older brother.
[106:21.36]Don't listen to a goddamn word that he has to say.
[106:25.52]Older brother.
[106:26.22]Real wink?
[106:26.75]Hold on.
[106:44.65]Oh my god, Taeyong, thanks for the 250 bits.
[106:46.97]I was racing you in your... I beat you, by the way, but to be honest, I had no idea what I was doing 90% of the time.
[107:01.25]It was a fun game.
[107:02.67]I had a lot of fun.
[107:03.19]We could just sit there and talk and just hang out.
[107:09.33]Hold on.
[107:13.22]Stretch!
[107:15.89]I might actually take a little walk.
[107:20.35]I'm going to take a lubricated walk.
[107:21.95]I don't even know what that means, but I feel like I do.
[107:25.92]Hey, Bitslave, thanks for the 300.
[107:31.84]Bits, appreciate it, Bitslave.
[107:34.52]It's me, Bitslave, again, and it would mean the world to me.
[107:36.88]You didn't say that.
[107:37.56]It would mean a lot to me if you checked out my video on the gamer drink of the day.
[107:42.22]Thanks for buying with Wonderfellin.
[107:43.12]What do you mean gamer drink of the day?
[107:49.67]this is like this is like this alcohol so how is this why is this a gamer drink drink makers mark Kentucky why is this gamer drink makers mark Kentucky bourbon whiskey
[108:15.34]It's handmade.
[108:17.22]It's distilled, aged, and bottled by the Makers Mark Distillery Incorporated in Star Hill Farm, Loretto, Kentucky, USA.
[108:26.28]Alright.
[108:26.70]Let's get this started.
[108:27.96]What are you doing?
[108:28.74]Are you going to drink it?
[108:39.44]You didn't like it.
[108:40.30]You didn't like it.
[108:42.90]You clicked on an ad.
[108:54.38]You clicked on an ad.
[108:56.45]Shit.
[109:00.41]Let's get this started.
[109:04.11]Well, I'm a Johnny Walker guy myself, but you know.
[109:10.78]Ads are getting out of control.
[109:13.92]Thank you, Bitslave, for the review.
[109:16.14]But it wasn't even a review, you just drank it and went, ow!
[109:21.60]SpliceableSpleen, thanks for the 500-bit stream.
[109:23.60]Will you marry me?
[109:24.56]Don't get me wrong, it'll be in name only.
[109:27.48]After we're married, you'd still be free.
[109:29.90]You can date anyone you want.
[109:30.94]I mean, you can sleep with anyone you like.
[109:32.36]I don't mean to be rude, but I'm not physically attracted to you.
[109:34.64]I'm sorry, what I mean is I'm not attracted to any streamer.
[109:37.26]All my relationships are with real men.
[109:39.18]I won't touch you.
[109:39.90]We'll go to a hospital, have artificial... Okay, goodbye.
[109:42.22]Thanks for the... Thanks for the $5.
[109:45.32]ChrisBock, thanks for the $5.10.
[109:50.06]Thanks for letting me shut off my brain for 20 minutes watching your stream.
[109:53.07]You're welcome.
[110:01.17]I don't know if it's funny or sad, but all the recent times you've played a game I recommended, chat hated it.
[110:07.00]Anyway, next time you play music on stream, can you finally play the Yonoid 2 into the Void OST?
[110:12.72]Write it down somewhere.
[110:13.54]I've been wanting you to play that for ages.
[110:15.08]Alright, I'm going to keep it in a tab right now.
[110:17.69]We'll play it tomorrow.
[110:21.29]Also, you can play the game, too, to be honest.
[110:29.29]Yonoid 2.
[110:31.01]Wasn't there, like, a copypasta about that, like, seven hours ago?
[110:38.74]I got it open, and we're gonna play it tomorrow.
[110:40.49]SpliceableSpleen, thanks for the five community subs.
[110:42.33]Appreciate it.
[110:43.67]Forrealdo, thanks for the 300 bits.
[110:45.67]Since you recently said your favorite 40k faction was the communist space anime fish, I mean the Tau.
[110:51.25]What?
[110:51.97]I was thinking you should play a 40k game like Fire Warrior.
[111:03.44]Baby.
[111:04.39]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[111:09.36]Hey, let's get the, uh, let's get the credits rolling.
[111:11.88]Credits rolling.
[111:15.17]Alright, lean side to side.
[111:22.61]That's better.
[111:25.56]Let's build a gamer birdhouse.
[111:26.92]I already did that, and everybody hated it.
[111:29.58]And, like, a thousand people, it's a favorite stream, and, like, people, like, I get gaslit saying that it was, everyone loved it.
[111:34.60]Thanks for stopping, guys.
[111:42.68]I loved it, I loved it, I loved it.
[111:43.98]See?
[111:46.18]I unironically loved that birdhouse.
[111:47.66]Alright.
[111:49.61]See?
[111:54.81]Wasn't it nine hours long?
[111:56.33]No, it was not.
[111:57.65]How long was that stream?
[111:58.47]That was a nine hour long stream?
[112:10.67]12 hours?
[112:11.11]No, it wasn't.
[112:12.55]Why would it be that long?
[112:18.95]But, here's all the subs from tonight.
[112:21.51]Thank you, guys.
[112:22.99]We'll see you tomorrow.
[112:24.39]Still about 4 or 5 bits to do.
[112:26.81]And then we'll take off.
[112:29.85]It was 14 hours combined.
[112:31.23]No, no, it was not.
[112:32.31]The longest stream I've ever done was like 13 and a half.
[112:37.13]Hey, Black Bear, CJ, thanks for the 300 bits.
[112:39.03]Have you tried putting your hands in the prayer position behind your back?
[112:42.27]Or doing the over the shoulder behind your back, grabbing your hand stretch to crack?
[112:46.28]Sorry for unsolicited advice.
[112:47.46]I just have fibromyalgia and those two things.
[112:50.52]And those are two things that are always good for me.
[112:53.64]Good to go for me to crack everything in my torso.
[112:57.44]You know what?
[112:58.08]I have this foam roller that if I lean back on and kind of roll back and stretch my, uh, arch my back a little bit, it just relieves so much pressure.
[113:07.76]And, like, I feel like I have to go do that for, like, five minutes or so.
[113:11.60]I don't really want to crack it so... I mean, that was just me venting frustration.
[113:18.10]But it's more so just stretching it and opening up the ribcage a little bit.
[113:24.01]The worst part about something like costochondritis, from what I've been told, is sometimes it just fucking disappears.
[113:30.19]It's just gone.
[113:31.63]You can have it for two months, you can have it for ten years, and it might just disappear forever one day, gone.
[113:39.56]And you'll never have it ever again.
[113:42.34]It's... What the fuck?
[113:55.07]Foam rollers are Gucci.
[113:57.19]They're great.
[113:57.53]You just gotta be careful with a foam roller.
[113:59.65]You don't want to do it too low.
[114:01.21]If you do a foam roller low, it's really not that great for you when, you know, there's nothing to support it.
[114:10.26]Costochondritis, yeah.
[114:16.98]That is the term of what I have been diagnosed with.
[114:22.07]It's a pain in the ass.
[114:25.75]Costo Unritis.
[114:28.33]Hey, it's Boo.
[114:28.87]Thanks for the $2.50.
[114:29.73]Hey, my birthday's next week and I'm heading to Hash House.
[114:32.05]Not.
[114:33.53]What?
[114:35.29]Why would you say not?
[114:42.40]What are you trying to do here?
[114:47.56]How many are there?
[114:48.40]At the link since I live in Summerlin.
[114:49.78]Going to the one on Sahara again.
[114:52.32]But it was still awesome.
[114:53.60]What are your favorite meals?
[114:57.16]How many links are there in Vegas?
[115:05.83]Not links.
[115:06.51]How many... At the link?
[115:08.59]What?
[115:10.43]At the link.
[115:11.55]If you're not going to... I thought there were two, three?
[115:21.04]I know there's two.
[115:22.88]Or three.
[115:23.52]Where's the third one?
[115:26.68]Where the fuck is the third hash house?
[115:28.56]Wait, hold on.
[115:29.32]I need to see this.
[115:31.53]I know the one that I go to all the fucking time, but hold on.
[115:33.77]Hash house.
[115:36.49]Go, go.
[115:37.05]Where is it?
[115:37.43]There are three?
[115:40.90]What's this fucking secret location that I don't know about?
[115:43.04]Oh, there's like six!
[115:53.21]One, two, three, four, five... There are five Hash House Ogogos in Vegas!
[115:57.53]Holy fuck.
[115:58.79]I go to this one.
[115:59.48]The one at the link is the best one.
[116:03.88]I refuse to think any of the other ones are any good.
[116:06.98]Go to the one at the link.
[116:07.94]Tell them, you know, the thing that I sent you.
[116:14.00]Business is booming since you mentioned it.
[116:20.99]Business is going to be booming all the time.
[116:22.37]It's a 24-hour diner on the Las Vegas Strip.
[116:25.75]I think it's going to be just fine without me.
[116:31.38]What time is the stream tomorrow?
[116:32.46]2 p.m.
[116:33.08]Pacific.
[116:37.99]Hey, shadows.
[116:38.87]One disciple.
[116:39.85]Thanks for the $2.50. $2.50.
[116:42.60]What are my favorite meals?
[116:43.70]The blue cheeseburger is the best thing on the menu.
[116:45.80]And then they have an awesome fried chicken.
[116:48.88]All their burgers are the best.
[116:50.34]The blue cheeseburger is the fucking most incredible thing there.
[116:53.42]They have like a meatloaf sandwich.
[116:54.52]It's a thousand out of ten.
[117:00.52]Shadow is one disciple, though.
[117:01.46]Thanks for the $2.50.
[117:02.28]Hello, Jeremy.
[117:03.88]When you are in the process of reading this bit message, I will redeem the JermaWink.
[117:09.04]Alright.
[117:09.94]Whether you eliminate the JermaWink TM or raise it to an exorbitant amount of channel points, it is likely that you will never JermaWink at my behest ever again.
[117:18.38]Thus, my request is, even though I know you hate performing the JermaWink TM, that you may enjoy this particular wink and cherish it.
[117:34.37]Wow, you really did do it.
[117:42.61]Cherished.
[117:48.53]Thank you, Shadows1Disciple.
[117:50.51]And that's the end of the stream.
[117:54.16]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[118:01.72]Have a great rest of your night.
[118:03.56]Take care, guys.
[118:04.16]I'm going to go walk in a circle.
[118:06.88]Stretch my legs.
[118:07.56]Stretch my back.
[118:08.88]Maybe take a bath.
[118:12.60]I'm going to be wearing my boomer brace tomorrow, that's for sure.
[118:17.19]Thanks for watching.
[118:17.77]See you tomorrow.
[118:20.31]And we have a couple more.
[118:21.91]Reaper just came in.
[118:22.75]250.
[118:22.91]Okay, Jerma, just admit the real reason you stopped YouTube is because you forgot your password.
[118:27.19]There's a reason why you never did an I'm streaming now or a goodbye vid.
[118:30.87]I should let you know that YouTube can get your password back so you can start uploading again.
[118:35.01]I did the I'm streaming now video.
[118:38.74]My last video is talking about how I'm going to be streaming like three or four times a week with a schedule.
[118:44.53]I made that video.
[118:45.97]I didn't make a goodbye forever, I'm never going to make a video again video.
[118:49.37]I did an I'm streaming video.
[118:56.57]I talk about like Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[118:59.23]We're going to be streaming on twitch.tv.
[119:01.59]I made that video.
[119:05.25]I remember saying those words.
[119:09.16]Did I mute my mic down here?
[119:10.12]Hopefully we won games in your dream.
[119:13.24]Because that would not happen in reality.
[119:27.82]Hey, I'm Geese.
[119:28.66]Thanks for the 250.
[119:29.80]Hi, Jermy.
[119:30.20]Every time my friend comes into chat, she says, I'm Jermy Wormy, and you never say hi back.
[119:34.50]Hi, Jermy Wormy.
[119:36.08]Not I'm.
[119:37.54]Hi, Jermy Wormy.
[119:38.46]You never say hi back.
[119:39.35]There's like 7,000 people here today.
[119:45.31]I'm sorry.
[119:53.44]What is making that sound?
[119:55.26]Do you guys hear this?
[119:59.25]I'm sorry.
[120:00.67]I'll try to catch it next time.
[120:02.29]I'm sorry.
[120:05.15]Hey future gamer, thanks for the 250 PSA.
[120:07.22]To cure hiccups, take a big breath in and swallow twice.
[120:10.46]I've gone many days suffering hiccups without this knowledge.
[120:15.40]Alright, I'll remember that the next time.
[120:20.31]That face when Jeremy Wormy doesn't reply to all your messages.
[120:26.40]Don't do that, you'll shit your pants.
[120:28.56]I'm not a doctor.
[120:29.18]This person's not a doctor and you're not a doctor.
[120:31.49]That was three doctors that just said things that doctors don't say.
[120:35.57]So take all this advice with a grain of salt.
[120:39.65]Alright, see you tomorrow, guys.
[120:40.39]Goodbye.
[120:41.61]Just crossed nine hours.
[120:42.65]I'm glad I could do a longer one.
[120:44.17]Sorry, I had to stop.
[120:48.23]But it was probably going to stop around this time anyway, so... I'm going to go...
[120:54.07]A foam roll for a little bit.
[120:56.10]And I'll see you guys tomorrow at 2 o'clock Pacific.
[120:59.18]I got a lot of things to play.
[121:00.88]And there's a wink right there.
[121:01.82]Don't worry.
[121:02.16]I'm not going to miss it.
[121:04.34]I'm not going to miss it.
[121:12.52]Hey.
[121:17.56]Alright.
[121:18.04]Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
[121:19.51]I'll see you tomorrow.
[121:23.92]Where's the-
[121:30.00]Vinny raid, Vinny raid, Vinny raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid.
[121:36.00]Who is streaming right now, let's see.
[121:39.00]Vinny? What's Vinny doing?
[121:50.00]Chrono Trigger - ow fuck.
[121:54.76]He's playing Chrono Trigger!
[121:58.00]I love this game.
[121:59.78]And this is the finale.
[122:01.33]The finale of Chrono Trigger.
[122:06.13]Here comes spoilers for Chrono Trigger.
[122:12.76]Chrono Trigger end of the game spoilers.
[122:15.10]But this is like my favorite game.
[122:16.54]I have to.
