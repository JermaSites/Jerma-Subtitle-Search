[00:12.28]Alright, so, what, uh... Ooh, I know, I know, I know, I know what we can do!
[00:17.26]The reaction test!
[00:18.27]Remember last night we talked about the reaction test?
[00:23.53]I was gonna prove to you guys that I see the world at 1.14 speed.
[00:36.50]Okay, where is it?
[00:37.30]Reaction test.
[00:40.58]It's a human benchmark?
[00:44.88]Let's get the camera back on.
[00:46.95]Wait, is the camera even going to be able to work?
[01:00.35]Let me, uh...
[01:02.38]Oh no, it's still this like purple shit.
[01:04.48]You could just see every individual hair.
[01:05.98]That was disgusting.
[01:10.60]What's the best reaction test?
[01:12.81]Is that the one?
[01:13.33]Or is there a better one?
[01:15.41]Let's change the title to... We'll just hang out.
[01:23.43]We haven't really... We haven't had a proper just sit around and chill hangout stream.
[01:29.22]In like a month or two, so...
[01:40.46]How about 1.14 brain speed?
[01:43.99]No one's going to know what the fuck that even means.
[01:51.92]Do they though?
[02:09.42]Alright, so let's get the camera back.
[02:17.89]I'm like ugly right now though.
[02:19.83]Should I really be broadcasting myself to IRL?
[02:25.43]With the pasted on dog hairs that are on my face right now?
[02:41.14]You know what I'm saying?
[02:44.37]That looks OK.
[03:02.27]Alright.
[03:03.39]We look terrible.
[03:05.47]Let me get that on screen now.
[03:08.79]This should be just a window, right?
[03:16.41]What other human benchmark stuff is there?
[03:18.32]Is there some other cool shit to do?
[03:23.60]Do a shaving stream?
[03:25.88]I can't, I don't have like the necessary means to do that.
[03:32.96]Space bar challenge?
[03:38.46]Alright, so I have to wait for green.
[03:47.61]So you have to do this five times.
[03:54.95]Do it over here.
[03:55.75]I'm not going to shave at my desk.
[04:01.30]Shave at the desk?
[04:02.92]No.
[04:03.42]I'm going to get in trouble if I do that.
[04:05.84]Won't I get in trouble?
[04:09.64]Alright, let's do it.
[04:10.30]I just want to see what it looked like.
[04:18.19]Uh, let's see.
[04:22.81]There's like number memory, verbal memory, visual memory.
[04:29.96]Okay.

[07:42.73]On to 200.
[07:42.95]Fuck yeah.

[63:01.28]Lemonade Stand game.
[63:03.80]Play Lemonade Stand at Cool Math Games.
[63:14.17]How does this work?
[63:16.97]Your goal is to make as much money as you can in 7, 14, or 21 days by selling lemonade at your lemonade stand.
[63:22.95]Buy cups, lemons, sugar, and ice cubes and set your recipe based on the weather and conditions.
[63:27.05]Start with the basic recipe, but try to vary the recipe and see if you can do better.
[63:30.39]Lastly, set up your price and sell your lemonade at the stand.
[63:32.45]Try changing up the price based on the weather.
[63:34.64]At the end of the game, you'll see how much money you made.
[63:35.94]Write it down and play again to see if you can be proud to be beaten.
[63:37.84]Okay.
[63:43.58]Let's do it.
[63:45.61]Let me just get this in the right spot.
[63:50.61]It's not going to be in the right spot.
[63:52.09]This is going to be all fucked up.
[63:59.43]Get that.
[64:08.09]Looks good.
[64:08.71]Yeah, I don't want a bunch of website bullshit all over this.
[64:13.05]You know what I'm saying?
[64:14.01]I want it to look clean.
[64:21.62]okay so far so good let's make it a little bigger so this is lemonade stand somebody like wrapped in tinfoil spider-manning on my walls
[64:57.91]Can you guys hear that?
[65:05.18]Oh.

[65:08.54]What is it?
[65:11.40]Okay, that's strange.
[65:12.26]This is, uh, Lemonade.
[65:13.60]I think, is it raining?
[65:14.72]Is it raining in Las Vegas right now?
[65:19.31]I think it is.
[65:19.83]That's weird.
[65:21.65]Alright, so, uh, you have to deal with the weather, which plays a big part when customers are deciding whether or not they want to come.
[65:28.96]Customer satisfaction, as you sell your lemonade, people will decide how much they like or dislike it.
[65:32.96]Let me get my fucking face out of the way.

[85:35.40]I sold it all out.
[85:38.89]Lemon sale?
[85:41.01]Oh, fuck.
[85:47.01]83 degrees.
[85:47.33]Here we go.
[85:52.32]Change the game category to Lemonade Stand.
[85:54.48]I guess I could.
[85:55.14]So it's overcast, 83 degrees.
[85:58.60]It's time to buy.
[85:59.00]75 lemons.
[85:59.24]48 cups of sugar.
[85:59.78]1,000 ice cubes.
[86:00.30]This is the one.
[86:20.04]25 cents, 7 lemons, 10 sugars, 8 ice cubes.
[86:25.52]30 cents.
[86:28.11]Go.
[86:28.17]28, 28 cents.
[86:30.81]Come on now.
[86:35.07]Come on.
[86:45.60]Alright, alright.
[86:46.36]We got the late customers here.
[86:47.30]Good.
[86:48.82]Good.
[86:49.56]Beautiful.
[86:52.31]83 degrees.
[86:52.57]A little cloudy.
[86:53.11]Let's get some more of that sugar.
[86:58.86]No.
[86:59.20]Give me more ice cubes.
[87:01.62]Don't fuck with the recipe.
[87:03.02]It's still 83 degrees.
[87:05.44]Keep it at 28 cents.
[87:19.55]It's alright.
[87:20.27]That's pretty good.
[87:21.45]It was a little too sugary, but it's okay.
[87:24.09]I made money.
[87:27.75]That's pretty good.
[87:28.29]I still have 48 customers.
[87:30.67]Right now, we gotta slow it down.
[87:36.61]360 ice rip.
[87:39.82]This is fun.
[87:41.04]It's so easy.
[87:43.62]Just to play it.
[87:44.68]Alright.
[87:45.26]56 degrees.
[87:45.50]I'm going to sneeze.
[87:46.08]I'm going to take the sneeze cam off.
[87:48.12]I can't.
[87:50.82]I couldn't.
[87:51.44]My button's not configured to the right thing.
[87:54.56]Let's get some more cups.
[87:58.24]Let's get some more sugar.
[87:59.32]Way more sugar than that.
[88:10.24]Let's go with 20 cents.
[88:12.59]Eight lemons.
[88:14.69]eight sugar three four ice three ice per cup seven sugars seven lemons 20 cents 18 cents buy it it's good
[88:42.18]That was alright.
[88:44.34]60.
[88:44.78]Keep the same recipe.
[88:52.33]30 lemons.
[88:53.01]I'm going to cut the sugar a little.
[88:57.81]Let's go four cubes.
[89:00.25]No, five.
[89:01.03]No, four cubes.
[89:03.12]Cut the sugar just a little bit.
[89:06.04]Add some extra lemon.
[89:06.78]20 cents.
[89:11.70]18 cents.
[89:16.78]I got to liquidate.
[89:25.68]It's the last day.
[89:30.18]Final day.
[89:31.52]It's time to make money.
[89:32.54]Watch this one.
[89:34.34]87 degrees outside.
[89:35.08]I got 21 lemons.
[89:35.72]We're going to do... We're going all in.
[90:12.50]20 ice... Wait.
[90:21.57]I can do 10 pitchers.
[90:23.49]10, 20, 30... That's... Just make it 100% ice.
[90:27.31]No, no, no.
[90:28.85]That's a good strategy right here.
[90:33.98]45 cents...
[90:41.96]10 lemons 10 12 sugars 10 ice per cup 33 cents 35 cents 35 cents 30 I was wrong 30 cents 30 cents
[91:14.88]I had to go all in.
[91:19.62]I was just at the New York Stock Exchange.
[91:22.72]Sell it, sell it.
[91:23.68]No, sell it for less.
[91:24.62]Sell it for less than him.
[91:26.26]Less than that, please.
[91:27.30]Somebody please buy it.
[91:28.32]20 bucks profit.
[91:32.17]Nice, that's cool.
[91:35.45]New York fucking Stock Exchange.
[91:36.75]I just undercut myself.
[91:38.15]That's the difference.
[91:40.73]$20 in a month.
[92:02.64]Look, all we need... Hold on a second.
[92:08.39]Wait a minute.
[92:12.40]We just need one person to buy one glass of lemonade for like $30.
[92:34.05]Um, so let's do like 5,000 cents and there are going to be 40 lemons, 50 sugars, and like 30 ice cubes.
[93:05.12]Somebody bought it.
[93:08.34]How did I sell out if nobody bought me a thing?
[93:15.75]Well, anyways, that was fun.
[93:18.09]The ice melted.
[93:18.99]Oh.
[93:20.31]That was cool.
[93:22.43]Uh, so... Oh, it's the end of the stream voice!
[93:25.75]No.
[93:26.57]Uh, but maybe.
[93:27.88]Depends.
[93:29.78]I think... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[93:33.52]He's gonna... Here he goes.
[93:36.14]McDonald's manager?
[93:39.74]What is McDonald's manager?
[93:43.68]Is it a game?
[93:52.28]It's the McDonald's game?
[93:53.56]Now I want McDonald's.
[93:55.24]I'm turning the stream off.
[93:59.93]Hold on.
[94:03.35]The McDonald's game.
[94:09.14]Play McDonald's video game.
[94:10.73]No, I don't wanna do this.
[94:14.07]This looks like a Diner Dash.
[94:20.45]Okay, here's what I want you guys to do.
[94:21.87]Ready?
[94:22.67]This is what we're gonna do.
[94:25.25]Let me increase my size here.
[94:29.30]So, what I want you guys to do is in the Discord, in the Discord I have that channel for recommendations.
[94:36.38]Let's lay out a plan here.
[94:38.82]next stream which will be oh what's today Saturday we will do hmm should I start ace attorney on like Monday what do you think am I gonna finish ace attorney will I actually do that
[95:08.22]Or maybe I'll start it tomorrow.
[95:09.14]Alright, here's the plan.
[95:13.16]I'm gonna start Ace Attorney tomorrow.
[95:15.53]I'm gonna get it on iPad.
[95:16.41]I'm gonna plug it in and get everything done.
[95:20.21]Also, in the meantime, go to the Discord
[95:24.83]And there is that recommendation channel.
[95:26.59]By the way, you gotta follow the rules.
[95:27.63]There are rules in that channel.
[95:28.69]You don't just go over there and just, like, spam shit.
[95:31.26]If there are Flash games, and I mean, like, online, fun, interesting, like, McDonald's games that I've never done, right?
[95:42.60]I want to do them because it's fun just to kind of hang out and chill and just relax and play some fun little games.
[95:48.92]So we'll do that after I probably finish Ace Attorney.
[95:52.64]So we're going to start Ace Attorney tomorrow and then I won't be streaming after tomorrow.
[95:58.54]I will be taking a break for a day or two.
[96:01.56]So after tomorrow's Ace Attorney stream, we will pick back up on Wednesday.
[96:07.10]And depending on where I am with Ace Attorney, we'll see how it goes.
[96:11.42]I think that's a pretty good plan.
[96:15.80]How many Ace Attorneys will I play?
[96:18.12]That, I mean, I don't, I can't really, I don't know.
[96:20.87]There's, I don't really have a gauge to tell you that right now because if I have fun playing the first one and I actually get through the first one and I'm like, this is great, I can't wait to play the next one, then we'll just do them in succession.
[96:31.79]At least for, I mean, I'm not going to do Ace Attorney, Ace Attorney, Ace Attorney, Ace Attorney, Ace Attorney, we'll break them up so they're not, you know, awful to do that that many times in a row.
[96:44.56]I have never played an Ace Attorney game.
[96:46.02]I don't know what they are.
[96:47.78]The only thing I know is that meme where you point your finger and you scream, objection, right?
[96:52.42]I don't know.
[96:52.74]I don't even know what that means.
[96:56.40]They're long as hell.
[96:58.31]How long is the first one?
[97:04.27]Is the first one more than like 8 to 12 hours?
[97:06.47]10 hours?
[97:10.89]17 hours?
[97:15.98]They're too long to beat in a day.
[97:19.63]About 17 hours.
[97:24.85]How long to beat says 17.
[97:27.53]Well, whatever.
[97:29.91]That was an incredibly highly requested thing.
[97:33.47]So... I'm going to try it.
[97:37.07]Look, if after a few hours it's like, alright, this was fun, but I don't know if I'm going to stream it.
[97:43.21]Who knows?
[97:43.49]I might get really into it.
[97:44.89]And we might have a great time.
[97:50.62]So, look, I'm not going to tell you we're going to do a full completion run of all the Ace Attorney games, but I've blindly never played them before, so might as well start the first one on stream and see how it goes.
[98:02.48]Your eyes are really popping.
[98:05.75]Like, out of my head?
[98:06.41]What do you mean?
[98:15.61]Should I... Is that a problem?
[98:17.48]That sounds like a problem.
[98:23.06]Very bright.
[98:24.04]Oh.
[98:25.22]I don't think I did anything with my settings on my camera.
[98:29.69]But yeah, we'll call it tonight.
[98:31.09]That should be it for tonight.
[98:32.17]Because I really wanted just to kind of close the book.
[98:35.13]We'll go three days in a row.
[98:36.81]So I really wanted to close the book on the Dreamcast stuff.
[98:39.65]Which is now done.
[98:40.89]Shenmue still exists.
[98:42.59]That's going to have to be dedicated to a completely different day.
[98:45.23]Seaman and Space Channel.
[98:48.32]The first one.
[98:50.12]are not going to be part of like the Dreamcast streams.
[98:52.68]I'll do them completely separately.
[98:54.23]We'll just do them on a random day where they get in.
[98:58.55]So, and don't think that this is me just spouting off my typical bullshit.
[99:02.67]Uh, I loved Space Channel.
[99:04.81]So I'm absolutely going to go back.
[99:05.99]We're going to play the first one, absolutely.
[99:08.61]So.
[99:10.25]Uh, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[99:11.99]We'll start Ace Attorney.
[99:15.72]Jet Set Radio abandoned and forgotten by big boomer media.
[99:19.98]I'm going to go shave.
[99:20.82]I'm going to go get some McDonald's.
[99:23.74]So literally the one guy that said McDonald's is the reason why the stream's turning off.
[99:27.83]Just want to make sure everyone's well aware of that.
[99:33.01]End of the stream, yeah.
[99:33.79]We're going to go tomorrow.
[99:35.59]Ace Attorney, I'll see you guys there.
[99:37.77]If you show up, you know, if you don't, then that's fine.
[99:39.83]We'll see you another time.
[99:43.95]I have to go get this thing off my face.
[99:49.38]But let's do the bits.
[99:51.84]Let's check it from earlier.
[99:53.16]It's a little bit shorter tonight, but I kind of had the inkling that I was going to go three days in a row anyway, so... A little bit shorter stream in the middle here.
[100:06.13]And $50 just kind of blasted in right now.
[100:10.49]Tyler Mike just gave 50 bucks 5,000 bits. 5,000.
[100:18.35]Glad to hear you're playing the Ace Attorney trilogy.
[100:20.79]I finished it recently and I really enjoyed it.
[100:22.95]I think you will especially like it if you get into doing the voice.
[100:26.11]The voice is like you did in Sorcery.
[100:28.15]Also, just want to remind you that it's been over two months since your last stream with Vinny.
[100:32.43]That didn't go too well.
[100:33.53]You guys said you'd try again, so I just thought I would remind you.
[100:36.69]jermaHeart and Vine Heart.
[100:40.24]Yeah, I mean, we... It's just kind of whenever we kind of both feel like it, right?
[100:46.84]We didn't put, like, a set in stone.
[100:48.13]Hey, let's do something else.
[100:49.83]It just kind of happens.
[100:51.69]I still have to do the gamer challenge with Joel.
[100:54.67]Joel and I are going to do a stream at the same time where we do a gamer challenge.
[100:57.73]And the first person to complete the challenge wins the trophy.
[101:03.70]We're going to get a custom-made trophy built.
[101:05.48]I'm making this up now, but now it has to happen because I just said it on live, so...
[101:11.28]And we're not gonna do getting over it, because he already has practice in that game.
[101:15.74]I played that game a year and a half ago.
[101:18.48]He has the edge there.
[101:19.86]I'm not gonna give him the house edge.
[101:22.14]We have to have a game that neither one of us has played, both completely blind going into it, that's a highly skilled game.
[101:35.33]And this trophy's gonna be worth about $2500.
[101:36.63]It's gonna be made of solid gold.
[101:43.59]That's a lie too, but I'm gonna say that that's not gonna happen because I'm not gonna do that.
[101:51.02]But yeah, we'll figure that out.
[101:52.72]All in due time.
[101:54.16]But let's go back to the beginning.
[101:55.70]No $2,500 gold statue.
[101:57.17]Just want to be sure.
[101:57.67]I don't want to put any pressure on people that maybe think, well, holy shit, we're going to do $2,500.
[102:02.63]Why'd you say that, Jeremy?
[102:04.47]Unfriended.
[102:05.51]Oh, you know.
[102:06.73]Hey, Dork Cube, thanks for the $1.
[102:08.15]I've come to the realization in the last few years that... Wait.
[102:11.47]Oh, because we streamed yesterday.
[102:12.46]This is all from yesterday.
[102:14.90]Oh, that makes sense.
[102:15.42]Okay.
[102:17.12]So yeah, the last stream was less than 24 hours ago.
[102:19.84]That's right.
[102:21.35]So there, we caught those, uh, earlier.
[102:23.17]Thank you though, everybody.
[102:26.43]Just give him a top banana.
[102:28.41]Hey, Sad Vega, thanks for the $1.
[102:29.85]Hey, Jerma, I come bearing gifts.
[102:31.25]This is Resident Evil 2 on 500% facial animations.
[102:35.38]Here's the video.
[102:37.40]What?
[102:41.24]Who the hell made this?
[102:42.38]Why, what?
[102:45.40]Uh...
[102:49.50]so you can go in and mod the game oh my god that's unbelievable this is crazy you can do body animations too
[103:21.29]That's un-fucking-real.
[103:25.20]Chode on stream?
[103:26.38]Here.
[103:29.58]Look at this shit.
[103:35.74]Alright, maybe I'll... What if I do Claire B?
[103:38.48]What if I do Claire's storyline with this?
[103:46.51]So it goes underground.
[103:48.43]Huh.
[103:49.39]That's it.
[103:50.51]That's our way out.
[103:52.05]Lieutenant Branagh!
[103:53.65]Marvin!
[103:54.13]This is scarier than some parts of the game.
[103:56.79]It's time to go.
[104:03.46]We need to get you to a hospital right now.
[104:06.78]No, no, I can't.
[104:09.20]Save yourself.
[104:11.00]Come on, I've got you.
[104:11.90]Go!
[104:14.16]Look, we can still make it out of here together.
[104:15.84]It's too...
[104:23.33]I tried, Leon.
[104:25.47]It's really weird.
[104:26.35]But I couldn't stop it.
[104:29.75]We can't let this thing spread.
[104:32.87]It's all you now.
[104:35.69]Just go.
[104:36.73]Those eyes.
[104:38.13]Bouncing around.
[104:42.07]Every single face you see here is a Gmod YouTube video thumbnail.
[104:48.13]All of them.
[104:50.46]Take any screenshot from any second of this video, and you will have a YouTuber thumbnail video.
[105:01.28]That's... That's hilarious.
[105:05.09]But, thank you, uh, Sad Vega.
[105:08.27]Didn't even know that existed.
[105:09.13]That's hilarious.
[105:11.53]Thank you, SomeGuy9 for the ten dollars.
[105:15.22]Alright, enough of the Phantom of the Opera memes.
[105:17.06]To make up for the admittedly shitty joke, I decided to make an OC video.
[105:22.45]Although my editing's a bit rough, so please be patient.
[105:29.59]Wait a minute.
[105:31.35]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[105:32.83]I don't know if I can show this.
[105:34.31]Is this like Attack on Titan spoilers?
[105:39.57]Hold on.
[105:41.79]I need to watch this with the sound off.
[106:03.26]Okay, well, you promised it wasn't a fan of the opera video.
[106:06.62]And that turned out to be... A lie.
[106:21.45]So, I just want to make sure we are aware.
[106:29.57]Are you making... Okay.
[106:31.41]Are you making that up...
[106:33.78]Or is this something that I'm missing somewhere?
[106:35.24]By the way, if you haven't seen Attack on Titan, there's like a character in this.
[106:39.96]In case you just didn't know.
[106:42.94]There's an Attack on Titan character in this clip.
[106:47.74]So, if you don't want to know who's even in the show, just don't click that.
[106:57.68]But thank you for the Phantom of the Opera meme video.
[107:00.04]What's up, guy?
[107:00.99]Thank you for the 10 bucks, too.
[107:04.46]Snooze and Cofter, thanks for the $1.
[107:05.76]I think it's finally time to bring the old schedule back.
[107:07.96]That's right.
[107:08.84]No schedule.
[107:10.32]Just turn the stream on and surprise us.
[107:13.37]It makes everyone happy because nobody expects it.
[107:16.63]Really, though, do what you feel like.
[107:17.71]Except not playing God Hand.
[107:20.95]Do play God Hand, even if you don't like it.
[107:22.83]Feel like it.
[107:23.93]I'm going to get more bits now to fund the God Hand stream.
[107:27.39]How much is it?
[107:27.89]$20.
[107:28.76]Oh, whatever.
[107:29.18]I'll let my subscription finance it.
[107:33.07]Now, if you're wondering what he's referring to, so earlier in the stream, I had a little heart-to-heart with chat about how showing up, you know, getting rid of the schedule, right, was something that I did since moving to Vegas, and I think it's helped a lot.
[107:50.09]I also think what will help a lot is, not necessarily help, but the sus command shows a timer.
[107:59.30]and the timer goes to zero, then a lot of times the stream doesn't start when that timer reaches zero.
[108:06.35]And even though I have, oh, 3ish PM, like no schedule, like afternoons, I'll let you know kind of the days, it's probably time to get rid of the countdown timer for Sus.
[108:17.31]Because if I don't have a schedule and I'm starting somewhere in the afternoons between like 2.30 and like 4.30 PM Pacific, having a timer countdown is just very, it's irrelevant.
[108:33.84]So maybe the timer could stay, but instead of it being, maybe instead of it, no, but then I don't know if it would work like that.
[108:42.09]Maybe it could be set where it's like, you sense a stream starting today between like 2 and 4 p.m.
[108:47.82]Pacific, right?
[108:49.99]Because I feel like I'm burning a lot of people when it comes to stuff like that.
[108:54.57]Because, you know, oh, hey, tomorrow around like 3 o'clock, I'll be starting.
[108:57.96]And then, you know, oh, he's starting tomorrow at 3.
[109:00.30]The sus command, it's like counting down to 3 p.m., 3-0-0 Pacific.
[109:04.76]And the stream doesn't start.
[109:05.72]It's like, well, I'm here.
[109:07.48]Where is he?
[109:08.68]Oh, yeah, I was eating.
[109:09.98]I'll be there in like 20 minutes.
[109:12.01]Oh, well, the countdown went to zero and you're supposed to be live.
[109:13.91]You know what I mean?
[109:14.35]You're supposed to be live right now.
[109:18.41]I think 99% of people are joking.
[109:20.07]Yeah, but even still, I personally don't want to continuously have people think there's a stream starting at an exact moment and then you kind of just sit in here.
[109:36.02]That one guy got to him.
[109:38.73]No.
[109:39.71]I've gotten complaints from a lot of people before about, oh, I wish he would just go back to the schedule because he's just kind of randomly streaming and he's late all the time.
[109:51.04]And I get it.
[109:51.60]Trust me, I understand.
[109:55.38]I'm very sorry that streams just sporadically happen sometimes during the afternoons.
[110:01.71]But that was kind of the intention of getting rid of the schedule moving to Vegas.
[110:06.67]And we're all well aware of this, that since moving to Vegas, there's been more and longer streams.
[110:22.07]Streams should start around 3 p.m.
[110:23.99]Yeah.
[110:27.36]That's a decent way to... Or, like, give, like, a window.
[110:29.88]Like, stream starting between, like, 3 and 4 p.m.
[110:32.70]Pacific.
[110:34.30]Right?
[110:36.07]Because then at least it's not a countdown that people are going to be like, oh, fuck.
[110:39.77]Or have the countdown be somewhere in the middle and have it say, like, starting around this time.
[110:46.33]Or just give, like, the day.
[110:49.30]Time zones are tricky, too.
[110:51.68]It's become very clear that I'm not adhering to the sus countdown.
[110:58.10]It's been like that for months.
[111:00.62]And your time is valuable because you're here watching my stream.
[111:07.01]So I respect your time and I'm kind of, I don't want to disrespect it by just kind of haphazardly showing up when I feel like it and there's a countdown that just went to zero.
[111:19.14]Hope you understand.
[111:25.09]Just show up on time.
[111:26.69]But there is no time because I threw the schedule out the window.
[111:30.78]You see, it used to be, you know, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, 7pm Eastern, that's when I was, I had to be here.
[111:37.72]Now it's just, I might stream tomorrow, or maybe we'll do another one on Monday, or I'll do that on Tuesday.
[111:43.30]There's no set schedule or dates or anything anymore.
[111:50.09]And I'm not, I don't want to work on a schedule.
[111:56.97]Carve the schedule into your chest.
[112:01.56]Why not?
[112:01.92]Because I had a schedule for just about two years.
[112:07.26]And when I have a schedule of three days a week, that is the only time that I allow myself to turn on the stream.
[112:16.95]Because Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, that's it.
[112:19.61]That's when the stream turns on.
[112:21.73]And that's it.
[112:22.63]And I take three days off every week.
[112:26.06]four days off every week and it would be I would essentially find myself sitting there you know Friday afternoon going okay what are we doing today rather than oh I can let me get this going and I'll do it on Saturday just I don't have to do it on Friday I can get something ready and then do it on Saturday it's been a lot better
[112:57.05]Have you really tried to be on time?
[112:58.49]Yeah, all the time.
[113:01.63]But with the nature of like what... The nature of what we do on this stream, it's hard to like be exact.
[113:09.30]You know?
[113:11.64]There's weird technical... We play like consoles from fucking 25 years ago sometimes.
[113:18.04]Like I'm playing... Today I'm playing a ported game that the graphics don't even work.
[113:22.73]and need like troubleshooting and I gotta figure that out.
[113:24.55]And sometimes it takes a few, it's not as simple as, hey, the stream is on because this is what I'm guaranteed is exactly what's happening every day.
[113:41.45]But I know a lot of people say, I want you to be on a schedule, but I don't.
[113:48.65]So at the end of the day,
[113:52.14]I have to do what I know is possible for me to have the best possible streams that I can.
[114:00.08]And that's just all there is to it.
[114:14.49]So I want to begin the process
[114:18.35]of starting to detach from hard days and hard times.
[114:26.16]Because in three plus a year streaming, I've not adhered to them.
[114:31.60]Because that's not the way my brain has ever been able to work or function properly.
[114:51.51]streamer is afraid of commitment afraid of the nice girl I like no schedule because I like chaos no no but no schedule and no hard there's a lot of people to do it and they and they're doing just fine
[115:16.06]I know a lot of people, at least a handful of people offhand that don't have any schedule or any timeframe.
[115:21.83]And they, it's, it's, it's going very well.
[115:37.48]Disciplined emotional.
[115:44.53]I like, I just sort of tune into the stream when I'm bored.
[115:47.95]So no schedule suits me really well.
[115:49.35]If it means more streams and longer streams, then that means I get to watch more.
[115:54.59]Yeah.
[115:55.85]I mean, there's two ways to look at it.
[115:57.31]There's either go back to the schedule and actually hard time yourself and stream three days a week or dump the schedule like I have.
[116:06.08]And I mean, I streamed Simpsons hit and run for 12 hours.
[116:09.90]You know why I did that?
[116:11.79]Because I knew that the next day I probably wasn't going to do anything.
[116:17.30]And that I could take a break the day later.
[116:19.50]If that was on a Thursday and I am scheduled for Friday, it's like, oh, well, I don't want to stream that long on Thursday because it's just a lot of moving parts there.
[116:37.93]And it does.
[116:38.53]It works better for a lot of people.
[116:40.66]Some people, the schedule makes them, it fixes all their issues.
[116:46.12]It lets them be incredibly strict with themselves and on time and ready.
[116:53.68]But I'm never fucking ready.
[116:55.68]Every day.
[116:56.65]It doesn't matter what it is.
[116:58.82]And some stuff that we try to do here takes extra time or takes extra moments.
[117:03.66]And I would rather be able to know and go when I can rather than say I have to go at a certain time.
[117:18.87]People work in different ways and people can create things in different ways.
[117:25.92]There's no real correct answer.
[117:27.44]It's just how well you handle however you're doing the things that you're doing.
[117:49.57]Jerma, you're actually thinking up the best choice for fixing this problem that you blew out of proportion in your head.
[117:54.81]Just make the sus timer show a time range.
[117:59.23]I don't think I blew it out of proportion.
[118:01.83]Considering that one of the... One of the biggest channel memes on this channel is how I'm never on time.
[118:08.70]And it's a joke, but it's... It's there.
[118:13.64]You know, there's a reason why that joke exists.
[118:29.64]You admitted it was a joke?
[118:32.36]No, yeah, but I mean, like, do I necessarily want one of, like, the number one things people say as a joke on the channel is that I'm not on time and I'm late every day?
[118:44.57]I mean, it's funny, but at the end, when you put the microscope on, it's like, well, why the fuck is he late every day?
[119:05.37]But I figured I'd bring it up.
[119:07.11]Talk about it.
[119:08.76]Because then the more accurate it can be, it'll be better for everybody.
[119:26.01]We also call you short and stupid.
[119:30.55]Alright, come on.
[119:32.58]Let's go over this.
[119:33.34]Ready?
[119:34.97]short stupid and late You know when sometimes when you look over here and you see those things all the time It's like okay.
[119:46.88]Alright do any Anything else that people have to say?
[119:50.62]You know what I'm saying?
[120:03.96]But all quips aside, I think it's the right call.
[120:10.38]So, sus ain't going away.
[120:12.12]Let's move on.
[120:13.58]Sus is not going away.
[120:14.60]It's changing to a small time frame.
[120:19.77]The day will still be there.
[120:21.05]The time frame will still be there.
[120:22.69]Just no countdown.
[120:26.93]I've said my piece.
[120:28.87]Let's move on.
[120:41.06]Where are we?
[120:42.26]Hey, Divas!
[120:42.76]Thanks for the two bucks, Divas.
[120:49.22]Uh, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the one dollar.
[120:51.34]I may have told everyone to make this joke and not explain it to you earlier on.
[120:55.67]Sorry about that.
[120:56.51]What?
[121:00.29]Oh, it was the Hey Peter thing.
[121:02.41]It was the Hey Peter. ...
[121:12.34]Well, demonic cucumber was a funny joke and you got me.
[121:17.44]It was the beater thing.
[121:20.04]Hey, smelly boy, thanks for the $1.
[121:21.54]I'm hearing some nasty rumors about Shido.
[121:23.36]Can we hear him, please, Jeremy?
[121:24.62]I'm sure nothing bad has happened.
[121:27.86]Shido went on vacation to the downstairs living room.
[121:33.72]He's enjoying himself.
[121:36.72]He'll be back soon.
[121:41.36]He's not dead.
[121:42.66]He's very much alive.
[121:45.26]Hey, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[121:46.88]Hey.
[121:47.56]Hey, Choo Choo.
[121:49.40]I don't like your girlfriend.
[121:50.70]Hey, Binary Man, thanks for the $5.
[121:53.74]It's a YouTube link.
[121:57.10]Old Peanut.
[121:58.32]Baby Peanut.
[122:01.67]Is this... What is this saying?
[122:23.75]that me talking uh thank you binary man for the five dollars I appreciate it thank you fuzzy muffins for the 10 bucks small cheer to supplement doctor income thank you though
[122:53.79]Please, some love for the EU.
[122:55.27]The move hurt us badly and the schedule really helped us.
[123:00.93]I hate to say this, but that statement is incorrect.
[123:08.51]The streams have pulled back at least one full hour since I moved to Vegas.
[123:17.40]I don't know where you're getting that statement from.
[123:20.55]I used to start streaming at 7 or 8 p.m.
[123:23.31]Eastern, every time.
[123:25.99]I start at like 6 p.m.
[123:27.91]Eastern.
[123:30.11]I don't... I don't know what you mean.
[123:33.64]What does it mean?
[123:39.54]I pulled the... I pulled the stream back an hour.
[123:50.53]Like, telling me that I'm used to start earlier is just, that's not true.
[123:55.95]I start at like 3 p.m.
[123:58.91]I used to start at 7 p.m.
[123:59.75]at least, 7 to 8 p.m.
[124:00.67]Eastern every time.
[124:19.34]It's hard- it's hard to respond... to somebody asking a question like that, you know what I mean?
[124:25.74]It's hard.
[124:26.14]Because I... I've- it's- we've gone back a full hour.
[124:37.51]And I've already talked about how I'm- I can't- I'm not gonna start a stream at like 10 a.m.
[124:42.39]This is not gonna happen.
[124:58.22]I live in a certain time zone that's very, very far away from a significant portion of European people.
[125:06.98]That's just the way it is.
[125:08.94]I can't turn my stream on at like 9 or 10 a.m.
[125:18.08]I can't.
[125:18.58]I'm not going to do that.
[125:19.60]It's not going to happen.
[125:31.47]Just move here.
[125:35.94]But I'm sorry if you can't watch the streams live or if they go too late.
[125:45.34]But I already... Because remember, I'm starting the stream in the middle of the afternoon, which is something that I never did before.
[125:56.30]because I moved across the country.
[125:58.44]America's huge.
[126:00.18]There are four time zones in the United States.
[126:03.66]And I went across all of them to the last one.
[126:19.13]Britain is more important than Vegas.
[126:22.42]Well, I've told you, like, the data on my analytics, I think 80-something percent of every viewer is from North America.
[126:34.27]So think about if I were to start a stream at, like, 8 a.m.
[126:40.34]More than a majority of every viewer would probably not be here. ...
[127:02.58]20% of me does not reside in North America.
[127:10.67]Can't be late if you never turn on the stream.
[127:24.62]It's the same boomer antics as always.
[127:29.58]But it's... I...
[127:32.36]to put a cap on this and to move on from it, there's nothing I can do.
[127:38.44]It's like, if there's a show that is airing, right, just think of it like television.
[127:44.68]Like, let's say Game of Thrones, for instance, airs at like 9 p.m.
[127:50.06]It airs 9 p.m.
[127:51.65]Eastern Time.
[127:53.57]Like, Game of Thrones, the show producers, don't sit in a room and go, no, no, we gotta air it at like 11 a.m.,
[128:02.41]No, because it's a video.
[128:04.11]It's not live.
[128:06.58]A live... For instance, NFL, right?
[128:09.38]If there was a football game that played at 7pm Eastern Time... They're not gonna pull the Super Bowl back eight hours.
[128:19.80]Because they want to make sure that people... Nine time zones forward can... You know what I'm saying?
[128:28.85]It's a hard... That's a very difficult thing to balance.
[128:44.90]Stop comparing your stream to the Super Bowl.
[128:46.95]No, I'm just talking about, like, live.
[128:48.07]Alright, here's a shittier example.
[128:51.81]I don't know.
[128:54.17]This is not a shi- That's the wrong word.
[128:56.54]And this is not even right.
[128:57.46]Like, the Jimmy Fallon show.
[128:58.98]That's pre-taped.
[129:00.54]And they pretend it's live later on.
[129:07.87]Are you trying to please everyone?
[129:09.15]No.
[129:10.70]I'm trying to tell the people that are not pleased by the schedule that it's not going to change.
[129:15.83]Because there are... It's not just one guy.
[129:19.31]I get a lot of feedback about how late these streams start for EU.
[129:25.26]So I'm replying to that and saying that it's just not going to change.
[129:42.64]Anyways, let's go.
[129:47.86]Thank you to Keldos for the one dollar.
[129:50.71]It's a perfect Jerma to follow.
[129:54.91]What the fuck?
[129:57.25]What?
[129:57.43]What?
[130:15.10]Why would you taste it like that?
[130:17.00]How is that Jerma Dafoe?
[130:23.29]Why is that Jerma Dafoe?
[130:28.49]Thank you, though.
[130:29.21]Thank you, Juno, for the two bucks.
[130:31.85]Would you consider playing Sunset Overdrive?
[130:35.26]Since you played Jet Set, I know it's not very comparable.
[130:38.12]Probably not.
[130:39.10]Not at the moment.
[130:51.14]Sunset Overdrive looks interesting, but I'm not sure not now.
[131:07.85]Thank you, though.
[131:08.29]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber, for the $1.
[131:09.71]You had a big rant about it yesterday, so I thought I'd tell you that Kingdom Hearts 3 is actually canon in the Toy Story universe.
[131:16.97]I'm not joking.
[131:17.55]Look it up.
[131:20.44]Don't they have to do that?
[131:29.76]Isn't the whole game canon?
[131:36.19]Look, they gotta find a way to keep Sora around.
[131:37.85]Are they gonna make him a toy?
[131:46.50]It's that easy.
[131:51.96]But thank you, MiniClips, for the 10 bucks.
[131:55.02]$10 from MiniClips.
[131:57.44]On top of the many contributions.
[131:59.38]Thank you so much, MiniClips.
[132:00.32]Did you know that 9 out of 10 doctors don't recommend smelling Clorox?
[132:04.69]Well, 10 out of 10 me's would also tell you not to do that either.
[132:10.13]I would tell you 10 out of 10 times don't do that.
[132:16.92]What's going on?
[132:17.30]What if it was spamming?
[132:24.74]Oh, I did it.
[132:25.74]I stole disk one.
[132:28.58]You finally got it.
[132:30.18]You stole it from me.
[132:35.56]That's quite... How did you do that that fast?
[132:38.37]That is lightning-like reflexes.
[132:43.75]But thank you, MiniClips, for the $10.
[132:46.13]Thank you, DoorCube, for the $1.
[132:47.43]Space Channel 5 reminds me of Katamari in the way that it's a piece of art that exemplifies what makes video games such a great medium.
[132:56.36]Yeah, I would agree.
[132:59.18]Katamari is sort of otherworldly in its own genre.
[133:05.04]So you could kind of say that about Space Channel.
[133:07.55]Although, there was... I wouldn't call it genre-defining.
[133:11.99]But it was on the Dreamcast, so I might have to.
[133:16.33]But I do agree.
[133:17.97]It was great work.
[133:20.00]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber, for the $1.
[133:21.38]I kind of get what that guy was saying about Red Dead Redemption theme.
[133:24.82]Just listen to the similarities.
[133:31.45]And here's the next one
[134:03.03]how do you pick up on that shit you are you were right that's so funny thank you so much demonic cucumber and for the one guy that said that earlier uh thank you knuck for the knuck shock for the one dollar thank you is it PogChamp
[134:26.82]Freudian Weapon, thanks for five bucks.
[134:28.12]Space Channel looks like a hoot.
[134:29.51]Are there any other rhythm games you've considered streaming?
[134:32.37]Rhythm Heaven?
[134:33.97]Is it going to be added to the list?
[134:36.29]Just kind of wish I didn't give away my Wii U, but I really didn't think I was ever going to use it again.
[134:43.80]I will find a way.
[134:45.62]But thank you, Freudian, for the five dollars, and absolutely, Rhythm Heaven is going to happen.
[134:50.62]Keith Ward, thanks for the one dollar.
[134:51.92]Can my two dollars go towards a treat for Otto?
[134:55.73]Yeah, sure.
[134:57.42]I'll give him a snack.
[134:58.96]Thank you, Keith.
[135:01.24]Platidonius, thanks for the $5.
[135:02.82]Hey, Jerma, any chance you played Rez?
[135:06.47]It's from the director of Space Channel 5.
[135:10.81]It's funny you mentioned that game because that game was really, really awesome, but I couldn't play it.
[135:19.81]That game gave me a headache.
[135:21.75]It's a lot of bright lights and a lot of weird spiraling colors and... I, uh... I couldn't play it.
[135:28.29]I actually got kind of sick playing it.
[135:36.96]I think I'm... I believe I'm thinking of the same game.
[135:38.60]I hope I am.
[135:44.30]But thank you for the suggestion.
[135:48.24]And thank you for the five dollars.
[135:50.83]DemonicCucumber, thanks for the $1.
[135:52.18]Tonight on My Strange Addiction, my name is... Jeremy, I'm addicted to Crazy Taxi on the Dreamcast.
[135:58.42]He scratched my name out and put Etalyx there.
[136:07.21]Thank you, MindlessFilms, for the $1.
[136:09.09]Hey, Jeremy, my sister and I have been loving your streams.
[136:11.31]We made something for you, and I tweeted it to you.
[136:13.76]Hope you like it.
[136:14.42]Hehehehehehe.
[136:17.50]I don't have Twitter on hand.
[136:22.02]But I will definitely watch it after the stream.
[136:24.50]My phone's not... Where's my phone?
[136:27.42]What?
[136:32.65]There it is.
[136:35.93]Okay, let's see.
[136:38.59]On Twitter.
[136:46.03]Let's see.
[136:52.28]Well, I don't know what your name is on Twitter.
[136:56.84]Dermachittedandfarted?
[137:01.79]No, that's not it.
[137:02.85]That's not it.
[137:07.81]I know, that's not it.
[137:08.43]That's not it.
[137:09.63]There it is!
[137:10.29]Okay, my sister and I spent three hours of our Saturday making the rats.
[137:15.30]Okay, that's fucking awesome.
[137:18.32]I need to link to this.
[137:27.05]Let me see.
[137:27.82]Here we go.
[137:33.02]Stop beeping at me.
[137:39.72]That's so cool.
[137:42.19]Uh, does this work?
[137:46.37]Yeah, there you go.
[137:47.09]Somebody got it faster than I did.
[137:48.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[137:49.51]That's not it.
[137:54.00]It's this one.
[138:01.54]Rats made out of clay, I think?
[138:05.74]That drawing is fucking hilarious, too.
[138:12.18]Clay rats.
[138:19.04]Excellent work.
[138:20.68]Everybody loves the rats.
[138:23.66]And those are very well made.
[138:26.94]I like the other picture where they're at the... They're getting a nice drink from the fountain.
[138:33.27]Rat stuffed animal, when?
[138:34.57]I don't think I can do that.
[138:36.83]Because that's not an original character.
[138:41.82]Somebody owns that somewhere.
[138:45.26]And if I was selling like, hey, 3D movie maker rat!
[138:49.06]Somewhere, somewhere up the company corporate place.
[138:54.24]Somebody would not be okay with that.
[138:58.23]I could just make a rat, right?
[139:00.59]Hey, it's a rat stuffed animal.
[139:02.91]But that exact design?
[139:05.13]Somebody fucking owns that somewhere.
[139:13.32]Buy the copyright.
[139:14.26]I would love to.
[139:16.62]But thank you, Mindless Films, for the clay rats.
[139:19.90]Hey, Alec, thanks for the $1.
[139:20.86]Jeremy, you should just do an IRL stream around Vegas.
[139:25.08]I'm not... I don't really want to do those.
[139:30.54]Maybe if there was something very specific, but just walking around Las Vegas is... I mean... I don't know.
[139:38.30]And I would need a very specific goal.
[139:41.00]Not just kind of a walk down the street stream.
[139:50.59]There's a lot of interesting things to do in Vegas though, so... It's not like I wouldn't.
[139:54.66]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.
[139:55.76]This stream is sponsored by Honda and Toyota.
[139:58.74]A portion of it was not sponsored by them, but they were certainly given a lot of random attention.
[140:05.70]Hey, Bolescrop, thanks for the $5.
[140:07.76]Left, right, left, right, choo, choo, choo.
[140:11.50]Thank you for the $5.
[140:12.44]Thank you, Cocoronis, for the $1.
[140:13.94]Hey, Jerma, would you consider trying Jet Set Radio Future for the original Xbox?
[140:21.53]It might be a better fit for you, and the soundtrack is just as good.
[140:27.28]well um I don't know is it better is there actually like a better version or I mean that's kind of that's kind of eh
[140:48.76]I'm not sure to say, oh, well, the first one was better, the second one was better.
[140:51.54]There's probably... There's so many people fighting over The Last Jedi and, like, The Force Awakens.
[140:55.83]Like, you can't... How am I going to make a comment on that if I've never played it?
[141:02.67]But I don't have an Xbox.
[141:04.73]I would have to track one down.
[141:07.37]If it was on the original Xbox.
[141:11.01]Both of those suck.
[141:16.86]Future is a better game.
[141:17.98]Okay.
[141:21.92]Thank you banana aneurysm for the $1.
[141:24.06]Here, use this to buy the other disk.
[141:28.80]I think we kind of have to bury that one into the ground.
[141:34.74]That one's dead and buried forever.
[141:41.02]Thank you though.
[141:41.55]Thank you sir feline for the $1.
[141:42.61]No rat shirt, you've lost a fan and a friend.
[141:48.39]Well, look, all in due time.
[141:52.29]Rome wasn't built in a day.
[141:54.69]It took them like three weeks to build Rome.
[141:58.65]And t-shirts can't be built in a day.
[142:00.41]It took me three years to have another one come out.
[142:05.34]So... Rome wasn't built in three years.
[142:09.26]Took a little longer.
[142:14.30]But thank you.
[142:14.80]Thank you, Dorkube, for the $1.
[142:16.06]Fish aren't animals.
[142:17.48]The man who receives hundreds of gift subs every stream.
[142:22.77]fish are they are animals but they're a certain type of animal I can't keep up the on that one I'm sorry uh thank you mindless films for the one dollar uh linking uh I think accidentally uh didn't put the link in last time but there it is we saw it already thank you
[142:48.84]Thank you, Scar, for the $1.
[142:50.18]I found this guy wandering around the street, and I think he's missing his owner.
[142:54.57]His tag said Jerma985, but I don't know if that's his name or what.
[142:58.59]I don't know.
[143:06.51]Why is this... Why are they so funny to me?
[143:10.64]I don't know why they are.
[143:13.02]It's that tag.
[143:13.98]I don't know who it belongs to.
[143:17.20]That's fucking fantastic.
[143:20.12]Sometimes.
[143:47.12]Or one time.
[143:47.74]Thank you, Novi, for the $3.33.
[143:48.98]I think I may have actually said that.
[143:50.00]On stream.
[143:51.54]To you guys.
[143:51.78]At least on more... At least on four or five occasions.
[143:53.54]So, sometimes, yeah.
[144:14.74]But, that was a good game.
[144:17.03]What are you talking about?
[144:19.89]Uh, thank you, Dork Cube, for the one dollar.
[144:21.23]I need some advice.
[144:21.87]There's this guy who works at the local Dunkin' Donuts who has really beautiful eyes.
[144:25.51]Would it be weird for me to tell him this?
[144:27.97]It's not like I'm trying to hit on him.
[144:29.15]I just want to tell him he has beautiful eyes.
[144:32.42]Is this a- Alright, hold on.
[144:35.26]Is this real?
[144:36.68]Or are you doing, like, a reverse meme on me?
[144:45.89]But thank you, though.
[144:46.57]I would just say... I would just say, hey.
[145:00.14]You got glasses?
[145:00.98]Because I... Never mind, I don't know.
[145:03.79]I don't know, I can't, I don't know.
[145:08.14]Thanks for the $1.
[145:09.36]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $6.51.
[145:10.81]I can never think of anything funny or witty for these messages.
[145:15.21]I always enjoy your IRL streams, though.
[145:17.05]I do, too.
[145:17.55]They're fun just to kind of hang out.
[145:19.85]Just relax and just play lemonade games.
[145:23.48]I do enjoy them.
[145:24.92]Thank you for the $6.51.
[145:25.66]Awesome Stevie, thanks for the $1.00.
[145:33.26]I've been pretty lonely and depressed lately, and your videos and streams never fail to cheer me up despite it all.
[145:38.04]Enjoy your McDonald's short man.
[145:40.34]He sure is a big man.
[145:46.06]But thank you so much, Awesome Stevie, for the $1.
[145:51.64]Glad to be here.
[145:54.78]Happy that you can hang out here and have a good time.
[145:57.00]Thank you.
[145:59.59]Thank you something or other for the $1.00.
[146:01.51]What are some of your favorite movies?
[146:03.82]Gremlins 2?
[146:05.34]Ghostbusters 1?
[146:13.68]Are there other movies?
[146:20.99]If there are, I haven't seen them.
[146:28.02]I thought there were only like four movies.
[146:31.06]I thought I almost had seen them all.
[146:37.59]Star Wars?
[146:39.03]Guys, I don't like Star Wars that much.
[146:40.73]I just have a lot of clothing of Star Wars.
[146:45.46]We talked about this like a few days ago.
[146:49.22]You have like a 10% chance to own a Star Wars shirt for your wardrobe.
[146:56.38]They're everywhere.
[146:58.04]If 10% of your entire wardrobe is not Star Wars related, I'm not sure how it's possible.
[147:10.11]It is too frequent.
[147:12.77]It's too out there.
[147:13.57]It is in every store, on every corner.
[147:17.80]A Star Wars t-shirt is the Starbucks of coffee.
[147:21.98]It's just the Starbucks of coffee.
[147:24.64]Have you ever had a Starbucks coffee before in your life?
[147:27.98]If you answer yes to this question, you have a Star Wars shirt in your drawer.
[147:38.73]So, if you have never had a Starbucks before, maybe you don't have a Star Wars shirt.
[147:47.44]Just admit it that you like Star Wars.
[147:50.84]No.
[147:51.04]No.
[147:53.74]I love Star Wars.
[147:55.50]Of course I do.
[147:56.16]I almost did the clown horn.
[147:59.80]I don't know why.
[148:00.40]Uh, thank you, Dork Cube.
[148:05.16]Uh, we linked that artwork from before.
[148:08.14]The I did it, I stole disk one.
[148:09.54]Thank you.
[148:12.02]Thank you.
[148:12.38]And on the list for the $1, Jerma, after every time your stream ends, the duck stream keeps getting rated by a grill master and Dr. Phil.
[148:19.07]Do you know anything about that?
[148:20.27]Also, please play Claire V on stream.
[148:22.33]It's shorter and then...
[148:26.79]Couldn't stop that one.
[148:27.97]It's shorter than Leon A, and you could always play the Revengeance DLC after it.
[148:32.05]Which, by the way, that DLC is better than the base game.
[148:33.81]That's what I've heard.
[148:39.18]But Dr. Phil does not have a Twitch account.
[148:41.42]I can guarantee you that.
[148:45.60]No way.
[148:46.82]But Grillmaster, on the other hand...
[148:50.19]He's... He's just a bastard.
[148:52.51]That's all that needs to be said.
[148:53.41]You're welcome.
[148:55.21]Thank you for the... years... of support.
[148:56.05]It means a lot.
[148:56.49]Thank you so much.
[148:56.91]Here's to the great times ahead.
[149:22.05]yeah I look anytime I talk about changes or things that I want to try things that I want to do things that I want to say I I have to do them I'm not gonna just I'm not gonna do something because I think that I have to right
[149:51.84]Because once you start doing that, I feel like that's when you go through, like, you're going down the path of, I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this.
[150:01.43]No, but that can wait.
[150:02.79]I have to do this.
[150:03.77]This has to happen this exact specific way.
[150:06.63]Once you start to do that, you start to kind of lose, in my opinion, at least in, like, a creative sense, you lose what you started it for in the first place.
[150:23.51]wanting to do something and having... HAVING to do something.
[150:28.11]They're very, very different.
[150:39.84]And I never want these streams or me... anything that I do online to start to bleed into the have to category.
[150:47.85]Because I've seen a lot of creators over the years start to get into the have to categories
[150:54.11]And that's a place I don't want to be.
[151:07.84]And even if it is in a detriment to my business, I don't, that's the way it is.
[151:26.67]Jimmer, who is your crush?
[151:28.09]Uh, her name's Kim.
[151:37.44]Come on, let me see.
[151:38.00]Come on.
[151:38.36]Yeah, come on.
[151:39.38]Give me the points.
[151:40.70]Those were points.
[151:41.88]I deserve them.
[151:44.70]I deserve those points.
[151:46.24]And I'll take them.
[151:47.38]And I will stand at the back of the court and I will throw a shot put the basketball swish.
[151:51.17]Okay.
[151:53.11]Okay.
[151:55.25]But thank you, all of you, that... Yes, I do things that a lot of other people don't do.
[152:04.02]I'm all over the place.
[152:04.80]I'm scatterbrained.
[152:06.58]Some of the streams are all fucked up.
[152:10.84]But that's the way that it is.
[152:11.86]I'm not going to be able to change some of the deep-rooted personality traits that I have.
[152:19.82]And I don't want to.
[152:29.20]Don't let the jokes get to you.
[152:30.48]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[152:31.44]I'm not talking about jokes.
[152:32.26]I'm talking about actual, real concerns that people have.
[152:36.96]And that I have, too.
[152:39.30]You know, you don't, just to harp back on, you don't think I think about all the time, like, you know, you see me look at the clock, like, oh, fuck, it's like, it's 11 o'clock at night right now.
[152:50.19]It's like, this is late for, it's like fucking 5 a.m.
[152:52.77]for 6 a.m.
[152:53.41]for some people.
[152:57.15]You don't think I think about, oh, that stream.
[152:59.47]I want to do this stream.
[153:00.35]Is that going to be funny?
[153:01.07]Are people going to think that's cool?
[153:04.01]And then, oh, they did.
[153:04.63]Alright, awesome.
[153:05.29]Alright, that was worth it.
[153:06.11]How are people going to react to that?
[153:07.97]I think about it all the time.
[153:10.45]I want everyone to enjoy as much as they can.
[153:12.73]And I want the stream to be as fun as possible.
[153:19.29]It's upstairs all the time.
[153:23.17]This guy is... You're very self... I'm not self-conscious.
[153:28.28]Self-conscious is not the word.
[153:30.28]I've, like, shown you guys my, like, boogers on stream.
[153:33.54]I was, like, naked on stream one time.
[153:35.98]I don't give a shit about any of that.
[153:39.95]I just am concerned with, because the channel has grown so much, that I want to make sure that we can stay true to what we're doing here.
[153:49.63]I can stay true to why I started.
[153:51.01]I can have the same fun that I had two, three, four, five years ago.
[154:09.63]I don't, somebody just mentioned it.
[154:10.87]I don't know if it's a self-conscious thing as much as it's a, like somebody said, personal integrity.
[154:20.41]For me, like for me.
[154:26.00]I'm not standing on a soapbox and telling you guys that I'm, let me tell you this about me and why I'm so much better.
[154:30.94]It's just internally, if I don't do that, then I lose why I did it in the first place.
[154:51.82]Maybe you should stand on the soapbox.
[154:53.48]It'll help us find you.
[154:57.77]That was almost me uttering the words forever ban.
[155:00.45]I'm not going to do it, though.
[155:05.63]Alright, we're at the end of the bit, so only like a couple more.
[155:09.62]Uh, Zoro, Carlos, thanks for the $1.
[155:11.30]I just want to point out that SEGA neglects their properties so much that they even stopped making SEGA Racing.
[155:16.66]And they're just making Sonic Racing.
[155:18.60]And that makes me sad.
[155:19.36]That is, that is pretty sad.
[155:24.31]Thank you Magellan for the $5.
[155:26.05]Clue the Sniper for the $1.
[155:28.41]Banjo Boy for the $1.
[155:31.34]Hey Jerma, to get right to the point, I've had stomach issues that make me feel nauseous 24-7.
[155:36.60]It's been going on for about two years.
[155:39.58]And after thousands of dollars and hours spent on medicine, tests and procedures, and doctor after doctor, no one can find out what's wrong.
[155:46.72]But in the midst of all that, your streams have given me something to smile at, and on a rougher day, it's the only thing that makes me laugh.
[155:54.19]Thanks for everything.
[155:57.41]I'm really sorry to hear that, Banjo.
[156:02.72]I have first-hand medical problem experience, so I can know the hellish road that that is.
[156:13.93]I'm really sorry that you're still trying to find out what's going on.
[156:19.63]Hopefully, you can get on the right track soon with it.
[156:24.37]Thank you for being part of this community.
[156:26.25]Thank you for watching.
[156:29.56]Take care.
[156:30.58]For real.
[156:41.95]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[156:47.53]And thank you so much for the $1.
[156:51.25]Thank you to Razzle for the $1.
[156:52.73]Hey, Gemma, will you please consider doing the Claire of Resident Evil 2 campaign?
[156:57.69]I've considered it.
[157:00.65]I've considered it.
[157:01.25]It's a great game.
[157:04.51]We might fall into that at some point in the next week here.
[157:08.07]Magellan, thanks for $5.
[157:09.31]How much must we pay for Shido's safe release?
[157:12.71]I told you, Shido's fine.
[157:13.87]Downstairs.
[157:17.05]Irritable boomer syndrome.
[157:21.07]How dare you.
[157:32.86]Show Shido on stream to prove it.
[157:37.90]I don't know.
[157:38.42]Cheetos... He's downstairs singing right now, practicing using his vocal cords.
[157:45.41]He's fine.
[157:46.49]Don't worry.
[157:46.81]Thank you for the $5.
[157:48.17]Hey Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[157:49.35]I'll be honest here, Jerma.
[157:50.79]Since watching your stream for the first time, I enjoyed them.
[157:53.83]I've been on this site for six years now, and there hasn't been anyone who gets me to scatter to my computer and onto Twitch than you.
[158:01.35]Hope that speaks volumes.
[158:02.53]Never change what you're doing because it works.
[158:11.26]yeah thank you I'm happy that that kind of reaction can come out of somebody for this stream and I there is like a there is like a constant battle between uh like the different parts of my brain
[158:37.35]And some things I want to try.
[158:38.63]I want to do something differently.
[158:39.55]I want to do this differently.
[158:40.95]Maybe I got to change that.
[158:42.11]I got to do this.
[158:43.77]But the core has to stay the same.
[158:48.53]Otherwise, I will not be interested anymore.
[158:51.95]So thank you so much for being here.
[158:54.69]I appreciate the message and the fact that I can have that kind of effect on somebody.
[158:59.97]Thank you.
[159:02.17]It means a lot.
[159:04.51]And finally, an analyst with $1, I've never mentioned in chat, but I've had 13 or 14 major surgeries over the last 14 years.
[159:12.37]On my bad pain days, your funny videos help me get out of bed to help all the animals.
[159:18.02]Also, when will bits be raised as I have 100 more?
[159:20.94]I want to use them before then.
[159:23.34]The bit minimum is probably going to be raised, I said like a few weeks last week.
[159:30.73]So probably at some point before the middle of February here.
[159:34.79]Maybe like another couple weeks, just so people can know.
[159:40.84]But thank you.
[159:42.48]That's... I'm not sure exactly... exactly what you're going through, but that sounds like a lot.
[159:52.16]That's a lot of surgeries.
[159:57.70]I wish you all the best.
[160:01.23]I can't even imagine what it would be like to have to have a surgery every year.
[160:06.09]Hopefully you take care of yourself.
[160:10.04]Hopefully your doctors and everybody in your life can help you too.
[160:20.60]And with that, we're going to play through the credits.
[160:27.04]And here they come.
[160:27.92]Thank you everybody.
[160:28.54]All the subs, all the resubs.
[160:33.76]I got a little preachy today.
[160:36.16]And I don't mean to.
[160:41.06]I'm just trying to make things as clear as possible.
[160:44.26]So I apologize for the beginning of the stream that was a little preachy.
[160:49.94]And we touched upon it a little bit at the end too.
[161:00.30]But I had a great time.
[161:01.20]The stream was a lot of fun.
[161:02.90]Space Channel 5 is phenomenal.
[161:04.73]I can't wait to play the other one.
[161:15.23]And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[161:16.29]We'll try Ace Attorney.
[161:21.74]You're going to play Picross on stream?
[161:26.42]You mentioned it a few weeks ago.
[161:29.14]Yeah, I mean, okay, if Ace Attorney is not what I was thinking, and I'm not enjoying the time in Ace Attorney, then maybe we'll just do like a mouth-open Picross stream.
[161:51.60]Yeah, it's pretty much up in the air.
[161:54.22]I'm down for anything.
[161:57.49]So we're going to have Ace Attorney the original Phoenix Wright tomorrow.
[162:06.16]And see how it goes.
[162:09.68]Have an incredible rest of your evening.
[162:12.56]See you soon.
[162:13.82]Take care, everybody.
[162:20.55]Twitch ad?
[162:23.91]Twitch ad on Jerma?
[162:25.27]What do you mean, Twitch ad?
[162:31.77]What does that mean?
[162:32.27]What do you mean, Twitch ad?
[162:33.07]Yeah, I got ads on Jerma recently.
[162:43.62]Wait, you mean in the middle of a stream?
[162:45.12]During a stream?
[162:51.00]Not during a stream, right?
[162:56.61]At the beginning?
[162:57.21]Because I don't run ads on the stream.
[163:03.57]Free roll ads.
[163:05.01]Yeah, I've said this before.
[163:06.99]If I could turn ads off on the channel, I would.
[163:09.79]Just turn them off.
[163:11.01]You can't do that.
[163:17.44]I would toggle that button in a second if it was possible.
[163:25.24]I only get them when I first join, when I'm not subbed.
[163:34.39]That's weird.
[163:35.80]But yeah, you shouldn't be getting them in the middle of the stream.
[163:38.34]I just don't run them.
[163:45.12]But anyways, guys, thank you so much.
[163:49.69]Half of you go to Vitalik's, half of you go to Vinny.
[163:52.11]They're both streaming right now.
[163:57.69]And tell them Jerma985 sent you.
[164:02.06]And Joel, and 33% of you go to Joel.
[164:12.64]And 15% of you go to the ducks.
[164:26.73]Alright, guys.
[164:27.27]Good night.
[164:27.57]I'll see you tomorrow.
[164:29.71]Take care.
