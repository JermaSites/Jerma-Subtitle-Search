[01:12.83]um one day has not gone by yet so we're still in it's still one day only because it's still the same 24 hour period read a book you don't know how's it going uh Elden Ring DLC you know how it is you know what we're doing
[01:39.40]I'm going to slow it down a little today.
[01:41.38]Probably not do very much face cam.
[01:43.48]I'm just going to chill, play it.
[01:46.74]It's like 12 o'clock.
[01:48.30]Still kind of early.
[01:48.90]I'm going to chill with a smoothie, maybe get a coffee later and just hang out.
[01:58.99]The return of the barf drinker.
[02:02.07]Elden Ring, colon, return of the barf drinker.
[02:25.23]one day only one day only do a tiktok watch party I'm not watching tiktok at all period no zero
[02:42.18]You should do a Rugrats stream.
[02:45.63]Like the show on Nickelodeon?
[02:53.65]Alright, for every one reel you consume on TikTok, I am requiring you to go out and dribble one basketball one time.
[03:01.84]You understand what I mean?
[03:14.17]Okay, for every TikTok reel that you consume, you have to play catch with somebody with a baseball and a baseball glove, and that's one throw and one catch.
[03:32.47]The winds of winter is coming out?
[03:37.48]What?
[03:44.06]Is it actually coming out?
[03:52.89]Is that the one message that I pulled out?
[03:57.63]Can you play some actually good games this time?
[04:04.98]Okay, you don't come into the ice carvers, IRL ice carving stream.
[04:12.14]And you look at the bio of this ice carver.
[04:16.73]And they have a 20 years experience carving ice.
[04:19.51]It's like one of their favorite things.
[04:22.71]And you say, hey, I really would like to see you burn some logs.
[04:30.24]Yeah.
[04:30.72]What are you doing?
[04:35.42]Hey, can you, like, start a fire?
[04:37.11]Like, why are you carving all this ice?
[04:38.57]I'm an ice carver.
[04:40.77]That's what I do.
[04:41.27]That's what I love.
[04:42.45]I love to carve ice.
[04:43.43]That's what I'm doing.
[04:47.09]Alright, what's everybody's favorite element?
[04:50.18]One, two, three, lightning.
[04:54.72]It's not an element.
[05:03.20]know what's funny lightning is one of my favorite phenomenons it's one of my favorite things I love lightning yet I never use it in any video games really I don't I've never made an Elden Ring lightning guy build I always I don't know why in video games I gravitate towards ice when I love lightning that doesn't make any sense
[05:32.02]I'm one of those people where a storm, like a really kind of chaotic storm with that storm mist, dark clouds, and like that purple lightning that's all over the clouds.
[05:44.40]I'm not scared of that.
[05:45.24]I'm like, holy shit, this is the best fucking movie I've ever seen.
[05:49.45]I could sit there and watch that all day and just be happy living in it.
[05:59.69]When that, what was it, like a gale, whatever it's called, when that hits you in the face, and it's really kind of, it's not too windy where it's unbearable, but windy, that smell, kind of that electric smell in the air, makes me just want to take off and start flying, you know what I mean?
[06:16.45]It's too bad we don't have superpowers.
[06:26.08]He admitted that he can fly.
[06:32.75]You get it, man?
[06:33.55]You get it?
[06:35.67]Is that one of my, uh, the Woody, Paul the Beck of my string sayings?
[06:39.77]I have a few of them.
[06:44.37]What are they?
[06:44.95]It's like, hey, hold on, let me, if I really do some self-reflection here.
[06:50.06]It's like, what are they?
[06:52.68]One of them's like, um... Hear me out for a second, right?
[06:58.00]Listen to this.
[06:59.10]Listen up for a second.
[07:00.84]Before I say any words.
[07:09.71]No, Lala is not what I'm talking about.
[07:12.96]Lala is an impression of a goofy dog on the internet.
[07:18.98]That's not something I said or I say as a mannerism or a cadence.
[07:27.40]That's an impression that you all attached to.
[07:33.83]That's not my thing.
[07:39.60]Coffee Cheetos?
[07:40.44]No, these are sayings, not... I think I'm not communicating well.
[07:48.32]You're the cat puke guy.
[07:50.08]Yeah.
[07:51.48]Okay, that makes more sense to me.
[08:01.08]Mr. Satan.
[08:02.26]No, Mr. Satan, that's me doing an impression of an incredibly talented actor who has a great vocal range, who I am merely doing an imitation of.
[08:15.76]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[08:26.79]Omega-3 dog vitamins.
[08:29.32]Dude, shut up.
[08:49.95]Okay.
[08:50.83]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[08:54.25]You guys gotta understand something.
[08:55.67]Let me tell you something.
[08:56.79]Fuck, that is one of them.
[08:59.37]you understand it hurts because it's true okay should we do it let's do a counter I kind of I'm into that today I'm just chilling today so alright how many times today do I say you have to understand let me tell you something oh
[09:30.97]You could put any stream of mine, remove the vocal audio track, and take 10 of the things that I say every other sentence, and just kind of put them next to each other, and just put it over two hours, and I don't think very much would change.
[09:54.49]How come you're calling your streams Let's Plays?
[09:57.57]But this is the title.
[09:59.68]This is the title.
[10:00.46]I want to make sure you understand what.
[10:02.12]Oh, oops.
[10:04.08]Well, there's one.
[10:05.98]OK, well.
[10:10.62]That was one.
[10:11.06]Alright, let's let's go.
[10:15.74]Elden Ring.
[10:17.11]There it is.
[10:21.94]Let's continue.
[10:22.60]Last thing I did is I killed the lion.
[10:25.35]And then I... No, I did some... I killed... No, I killed the little Yoda guy.
[10:29.97]That was one of the coolest fights so far.
[10:36.07]I also... Offstream... Gasp, I can't believe he said that.
[10:43.07]Offstream, I got this to plus 10.
[10:47.53]Because there's way more somber ancient dragon smithing stones than I thought there were.
[10:55.51]I thought there were only three of each in the game.
[10:57.54]I thought there were six total, but there are eight in the base game, I believe.
[11:01.58]Or I think six of each or five of each in the base game.
[11:06.24]So I have this at plus 10.
[11:08.28]I'm going to use it.
[11:09.12]I really like it.
[11:11.34]And we'll see.
[11:12.12]I still got the same kind of grandpa drip.
[11:17.35]So that's staying.
[11:20.09]Do face cam for bosses.
[11:24.03]Yeah, maybe I'll turn it on.
[11:26.09]It's just going to be whenever.
[11:28.03]Today, because it was a little earlier.
[11:30.87]I'm just chilling.
[11:31.77]I'm just going to play.
[11:33.26]Maybe I'll throw it on for a little bit.
[11:36.38]Alright.
[11:37.88]First thing is first.
[11:39.56]I want... This is my map.
[11:43.52]This is what it looks like.
[11:45.38]This is where we were.
[11:48.03]I need to mark this as a scary skull because there's a dragon there.
[11:53.86]I need to mark this as done because I completed it.
[12:00.02]Right there.
[12:02.98]I like to put it right on top, but then you can't really click on the Grace.
[12:08.00]So hopefully I remember that that's what that means.
[12:09.79]I will.
[12:12.73]Do we know vaguely how much content is in the DLC?
[12:16.29]I've heard quite a lot.
[12:18.82]uh I played it for about seven hours last night and this is as far as I got alright now the real question becomes do I do I do the thing that it wants me to do and go over this bridge and up this way and maybe right up here or up here or do we get a little weird and do I go right up here and grab this
[12:48.90]The better question is, can I even physically go this way?
[12:53.22]I'm going to try.
[12:53.70]I'm going to try just to go straight up that way.
[13:08.14]Anything is possible if you're delusional enough.
[13:09.88]Okay.
[13:17.93]Alright.
[13:19.49]I also came to terms with a few things.
[13:22.79]I looked at my spells and I realized which ones I actually was using and which ones I was never really touching.
[13:28.95]This is a more condensed, controlled group of spells.
[13:37.50]I've got my banana, oat, peanut butter... Yeah, I can't even talk.
[13:40.90]Banana... Banana...
[13:43.91]Let me start over.
[13:45.35]I have a banana oat peanut butter smoothie sitting right next to me.
[13:49.33]I'm ready to go.
[13:51.07]That nutrients.
[13:54.10]Okay.
[13:56.10]I also think I'm going to be, I think the game will run a little better.
[14:05.05]I was trying a few things.
[14:06.41]I dropped a setting.
[14:08.23]I like restarted the game a couple times and it seemed to get a little better.
[14:11.69]I really do think it's just the shader cache thing, whatever the hell it is.
[14:17.05]Okay, so that's where I want to go.
[14:22.50]And I definitely can drop down from over there, but how do I get across?
[14:25.50]I think I have to go over the bridge.
[14:29.43]Yeah, okay, so I have to go over the bridge and then this way, I think.
[14:35.62]Unless, is there any other way to get over there?
[14:40.22]He thinks he fixed the stutter, LOL.
[14:42.35]I probably didn't, but I'm just gonna think positively.
[14:50.49]That's what I'm gonna do.
[14:56.36]These dogs are beefy.
[15:06.85]Don't hurt my horse.
[15:13.26]I'm not messing with that dragon right now.
[15:17.38]Not right now.
[15:21.66]OK, so I have to go across the bridge.
[15:25.42]I might have to go up there for now.
[15:32.68]He refracted the shader pipeline and optimized the game.
[15:41.41]I think I was over here already.
[15:45.19]Yeah, I got this already.
[15:53.81]I see an item.
[16:00.52]Oh, pog mold.
[16:04.50]No way.
[16:13.48]Okay, cross the bridge and we'll see where that takes us.
[16:16.40]I bet you when I cross this bridge, a giant monster is going to be on the bridge.
[16:28.51]What is the over-under that... Or that a ballista is firing at me from 100 meters away, 100 miles away.
[16:38.63]Place your bets.
[16:40.11]Place your FromSoftware bets.
[16:41.69]Is it gonna be a ballista that somebody up there is shooting me from?
[16:45.99]Or a dragon?
[16:46.73]Ah.
[16:57.50]It's a trip.
[16:58.24]Oh, it was a ballista.
[16:59.28]Alright, we got the ballista.
[17:00.52]Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a ballista.
[17:08.56]Cross that off your bingo card.
[17:13.77]Whoa, what?
[17:14.33]It's not shooting over here, is it?
[17:16.73]These guys are rough.
[17:25.75]Oh, please do not.
[17:34.96]Oh!
[17:38.43]That's a long swing.
[17:49.27]Shit.
[17:54.14]That was bad.
[17:54.58]He didn't get hit by any of that?
[17:57.32]That's weird.
[18:07.01]Alright, I'm just gonna chip damage him now.
[18:09.65]Uh-oh.
[18:10.67]Uh-oh, very bad.
[18:14.07]Ooh, we're good.
[18:22.99]I thought I fell off a cliff and I was like expecting just to die.
[18:26.43]I just accepted death and I was gonna look over and see Omega lulls, but that's not what happened.
[18:31.48]That was very confusing.
[18:40.53]God, I can't get this timing right.
[18:51.77]How many people are in this camp?
[18:52.89]I see a Grace.
[19:04.12]Is this the baby rattle character?
[19:05.86]This is... Yes, it's a re-skinned baby rattle character.
[19:11.23]I still have this move.
[19:13.25]It's a little different.
[19:14.77]And it's a bug wing.
[19:15.79]Okay, instead of a bug tail, it is a bug wing.
[19:18.34]I'm a bug streamer.
[19:23.36]If it has nothing to do with insects, I don't want it equipped.
[19:27.59]Okay, this place is kind of huge.
[19:31.39]Let me slow it down.
[19:45.22]How strong do you have to be to do something like that?
[19:46.86]What are they doing?
[19:53.75]They're preparing for war.
[20:37.92]No entrance?
[20:41.98]Huh?
[20:46.72]They were looking for me around the other... Oh, wow.
[20:48.38]I just outplayed all of you.
[20:50.03]This place is huge.
[21:07.52]OK.
[21:08.82]Before I get too invested in going all around here and up there.
[21:14.28]Can I go this way now?
[21:15.94]I don't want to get too invested over here.
[21:21.95]I did set a plan.
[21:23.09]I'm going to stick to it.
[21:28.53]If it's possible.
[21:38.21]Not quite.
[21:42.15]I gotta go up around.
[21:53.41]I might have to go into this area.
[21:56.37]Unless... I don't think... Yeah, I think I gotta go up and then jump from there.
[22:02.09]Let's see.
[22:03.47]Hold on.
[22:10.91]Oh.
[22:16.33]Oh my goodness.
[22:22.28]Oops.
[22:25.96]Where's the statue?
[22:34.49]I just want to see what happens if I do this.
[22:36.45]Because I am playing in 4K.
[22:41.43]It's not enough to be that big of a problem.
[22:43.08]I'm not getting like the stuttering that I was before.
[22:44.82]It's just my frame rate is kind of bad.
[22:46.42]I should probably probably have to play in 1080.
[22:53.02]I'm going to play.
[22:53.48]Maybe I'll play in 1080, but turn everything up to maximum.
[22:56.22]That might help.
[23:10.11]Let's see.
[23:11.24]Can you guys even see it?
[23:12.40]I can see a difference when I do this, but do you see a difference when I do this?
[23:22.10]I do that.
[23:24.06]And then we go like turn everything up really high.
[23:29.92]Right.
[23:32.77]How does that look better?
[23:40.40]No, it doesn't.
[23:41.41]Why is it so small?
[23:44.97]It also didn't really do anything.
[23:46.67]I think it's just the way it is.
[23:50.23]Why did it shrink?
[24:02.36]Okay, that was very weird.
[24:03.52]Okay.
[24:07.96]Okay.
[24:11.88]Alright, we're back.
[24:13.44]I think we're good.
[24:16.42]You can see now.
[24:22.44]Oh.
[24:24.04]My screen just turned off.
[24:25.49]We're back, I think.
[24:26.27]I hope.
[24:30.23]My screen's going black every few seconds.
[24:33.09]Well, it's did it again.
[24:34.11]Is it happening for you too?
[24:36.85]Something ain't right here.
[24:38.63]Hold on.
[24:42.57]Yeah, my screen is going black and then coming back.
[24:45.48]I have to just put it back to full screen, I think.
[24:56.80]Go back to the first resolution.
[24:59.76]Has it happened in a while?
[25:01.26]Where's my mouse?
[25:05.51]Make sure my mouse is in the right spot here.
[25:07.81]There we go.
[25:13.25]Fuck, it's happening again.
[25:15.38]I shouldn't have even touched anything.
[25:17.56]Why did I even touch anything?
[25:20.66]Everything was fine.
[25:22.48]It just was running at like 40 FPS.
[25:38.16]There.
[25:39.59]Okay.
[25:40.93]I hope it doesn't keep doing that.
[25:41.95]I think I just like fucked up my graphics card.
[25:47.37]Oh, God damn it.
[25:48.09]And if I just absentmindedly press sight of Grace, I think.
[25:59.77]Oh, shit.
[26:02.69]Oh, this is not good.
[26:03.52]Oh, I don't have to touch anything.
[26:18.37]Alright, if that happens again, I'm probably going to have to restart the game.
[26:21.27]I think I just have to accept that it's going to be like this.
[26:28.42]I can cry about it.
[26:30.58]I can be sad about it.
[26:33.00]But I think that's just the way it is.
[26:34.58]Holy shit, he got me out of midair.
[26:45.69]It's still happening.
[26:47.33]I gotta restart the game.
[26:48.59]To be fair, it happened after I died, just to let you know.
[26:54.75]So my screen's blinking black.
[27:01.76]Give me a second.
[27:12.39]Might be your monitor refresh rate changing.
[27:14.11]Yeah, that's what it might be.
[27:15.27]I think it's just kind of freaking out because I changed it back and forth like three times.
[27:21.85]I got the.
[27:23.80]I got the new NVIDIA drivers.
[27:27.78]This is before.
[27:28.48]Oh, this is bad.
[27:34.08]Uh.
[27:37.04]Now my actual whole screen is black.
[27:43.19]Hey, just like yesterday, we're gonna restart my computer to play Elden Ring DLC.
[27:49.84]I'll be right back.
[27:52.50]Goodbye.
[27:53.02]See you in two minutes.
[27:54.82]Okay.
[28:01.25]I think we're good.
[28:12.59]Has not happened in a little bit.
[28:13.88]I think we're good.
[28:36.21]We're back.
[28:45.78]Alright, don't get hit by the ballista.
[28:47.40]That would be great.
[29:07.02]Wait, what happened to the viewers?
[29:08.10]You had... Oh my god, that was loud.
[29:14.86]I retired, man.
[29:17.38]There's only a few hundred people here now.
[29:20.57]You're one of them.
[29:29.85]Okay, so the question remains.
[29:31.52]This is where the stake of America was.
[29:34.62]Let's go back here.
[29:37.88]We are back and we are ready to play Elden Ring downloadable content.
[29:57.19]whoa these guys are actually tough I'm not I'm not treating these guys with combat respect I'm kind of oh yeah these guys are these guys are very dangerous
[30:17.35]I like exceptionally dangerous and I'm not giving them.
[30:19.89]I'm treating them like they're just regular Godrick soldiers.
[30:22.81]Did I not get to the stake?
[30:31.44]Shit, I didn't get to the stake.
[30:33.32]It wasn't right there.
[30:34.04]Oh my God.
[30:37.74]Weird fucking groundhog day.
[30:42.68]My computer fucks up.
[30:43.70]And then I have to turn my fucking stream off.
[30:45.20]Then I have to turn my fucking computer off.
[30:46.44]Then I have to turn my fucking stream back on.
[31:22.58]Genuinely, how would you feel if you phased out of popularity?
[31:25.20]I wouldn't care at all, honestly.
[31:36.85]I really wouldn't care.
[31:46.80]Alright, I didn't really want to go this way, but I think this is a better... That guy's huge.
[32:00.47]Alright, I got the Grace.
[32:01.81]I think I'm going to take... No, I'm taking my chances.
[32:03.95]I'm going the other way.
[32:04.67]I'm going the way that I wanted to go.
[32:12.62]You know what also might be adding to the problems I'm having?
[32:14.90]I'm streaming in 1080, aren't I?
[32:18.74]Can my 3090 not handle a 1080p stream?
[32:34.01]Bro, that's too high.
[32:39.30]Do you think he really has the 39?
[32:40.60]Or did I just make it up?
[32:44.76]What an insane thing to make.
[32:47.10]Oh my god, there's somebody behind me.
[32:58.28]That's such a goofy thing to make up.
[32:59.85]People would just know.
[33:11.83]After all this time, I'm on like a 1080.
[33:15.77]Still.
[33:16.01]Okay, give them the respect.
[33:27.20]Oh my goodness, there's a follow-up.
[33:32.75]Guys are like little bosses.
[33:51.54]Damn it.
[33:57.12]You guys are horrible.
[34:02.70]There's the Statue of America.
[34:04.00]Okay.
[34:04.36]Okay.
[34:05.02]Welcome to the stream.
[34:05.72]The stream just turned on.
[34:07.02]Let's just pretend that.
[34:11.52]Jesus.
[34:14.31]Cool.
[34:46.84]Yeah, fuck this guy.
[34:47.88]I ain't putting up with that.
[35:03.67]What spell am I casting?
[35:04.51]That is Glinstone Ice Crag.
[35:07.44]This one is free.
[35:09.30]It does not cost mana.
[35:10.50]It's awesome that it does not cost mana.
[35:21.27]This is awful.
[35:23.65]It's like half beats of... You two assholes!
[35:47.60]Dude.
[35:50.82]You should- you have 99 of those?
[36:06.40]oh Jesus no that guy up there has it too and and this guy over here I can't oh I can use the horse okay yeah let's just get out of this
[36:41.05]I made it up here.
[36:41.56]I don't know what that means, but I made it.
[37:10.12]What graphics card do you have?
[37:11.10]I have a... Somebody just made that up.
[37:16.77]Somebody answered that person with a 100% lie.
[37:22.22]Oh, I am... Okay, I'm going the right way.
[37:23.58]This is where I wanted to be.
[37:41.89]Give me that.
[37:43.81]Your dark soul.
[37:49.57]Okay.
[37:51.00]Cool.
[38:05.76]I hope this doesn't fall off a cliff.
[38:10.10]Yeah.
[38:13.83]It's very smoky down here.
[38:26.42]Oh, well.
[38:29.97]Looks like we're doing this.
[38:42.14]Fog Rift Catacombs.
[38:49.39]What's going on- what's going on outside?
[38:58.24]What's wrong with them?
[39:00.84]Oh shit, there's a bunch of little people out here!
[39:13.35]Oh, whatever.
[39:32.39]Oh no, the bear.
[39:37.55]Really?
[39:38.05]No.
[39:38.27]There's gotta be a... There isn't.
[39:46.47]Ugh.
[39:54.94]Ugh.
[40:04.17]I actually sit at this.
[40:05.25]Do you have no face cam?
[40:10.29]Because people were really mean.
[40:11.39]No, it's just I like to.
[40:15.54]You guys gotta remember as of like two or three years ago, I never had a face cam turned on ever.
[40:22.08]Maybe like for horror games, but.
[40:25.70]I love this little thing.
[40:32.38]Yeah, it was a treat back in the day.
[40:43.69]Yeah, it allows me to, you know, put my fingers in my nose and... Have like a wicked weird looking face.
[40:52.38]Whoa!
[40:59.05]What the fuck, dude?
[41:01.99]No.
[41:02.83]Don't.
[41:05.59]Who would make this?
[41:08.62]What purpose does this serve?
[41:10.22]A ton of engineering had to go into making this.
[41:15.76]This is a... This is a 10 to... This is like a 50 million dollar project.
[41:23.63]But what?
[41:24.05]Did you crush people?
[41:25.85]No.
[41:30.63]It's crazy when you think about this kind of shit.
[41:32.43]It's like, oh, yes, we need to make a device that will crush any peasant that decides to come to the castle anywhere or come into the dungeon.
[41:41.84]Yes.
[41:42.64]Yes, it'll be 50 million gold coins.
[41:46.06]Crush them when they walk in.
[41:47.50]Make sure the spikes are fucking huge.
[41:51.08]Oh, okay.
[41:51.88]By the way, that was only used once on one thing.
[41:55.77]That accidentally walked into the dungeon.
[41:57.95]It was a mouse.
[41:59.27]I walked into the dungeon and it was... Well, actually, this killed like hundreds of people, but... It just seems so... It seems so over the top.
[42:14.56]It's also dodgeable?
[42:15.86]Oh, wow.
[42:16.20]That's cool.
[42:21.85]Sire, should we use any of our taxes to have one day of free bread?
[42:31.55]No.
[42:33.67]Make a second one.
[42:34.73]I think the spike's even longer on this one.
[42:50.78]Uh-oh.
[42:55.62]um I'm afraid of both of you does he have a bow so
[43:30.15]Really?
[43:41.96]Whatever, just kill him!
[43:44.94]Kill him!
[43:58.08]I killed him.
[44:08.10]Okay, I thought that was a Birdo.
[44:10.63]I think it's a Cannon.
[44:14.01]It is a Birdo.
[44:16.27]Yeah, it is.
[44:16.91]Um... I want to get this one.
[44:32.49]I've played this game way too many times to not just panic check behind every single corridor.
[44:45.66]I shoot him out of his mouth.
[44:59.62]Ancient Dragon Knights cookbook.
[45:01.14]Oh, I got another cookbook before too.
[45:02.40]What is it?
[45:06.93]Red Lightning Pot.
[45:10.05]Fire Coil.
[45:13.53]Fire Coil.
[45:17.57]It's Fire Coil.
[45:29.54]A tiny fire snake.
[45:32.28]This is S scaling with faith.
[45:35.99]Damn.
[45:40.25]Is that the highest scaling?
[45:41.33]It feels like that's one of the highest scaling consumables I've ever seen.
[45:45.59]This is A. Even the holy pot is A. That's S. You could probably do a snake build.
[45:55.65]Just put 99 points in faith and just throw those at people.
[46:14.66]Oh my god, I heard it coming and it scared the shit out of me still.
[46:31.13]Oh god!
[46:41.24]Are you still using magic?
[46:42.58]Sometimes.
[46:43.14]Whatever.
[46:44.08]I fucking wanna relax.
[46:46.46]I'm a magician.
[46:47.20]I like magic.
[46:54.16]Okay, I could go up top.
[47:07.21]I also have realized whenever I get scared or really anxious, I go like this.
[47:14.11]I'm not like, whoa, what's going on here?
[47:17.19]No, I always go, whoa, yowzers.
[47:25.30]Every time I get scared, I turn into, what's his name?
[47:29.34]Like Don Knotts.
[47:46.71]Fight or pallbearer impulse.
[47:48.98]Yeah.
[48:06.01]Oh no!
[48:09.11]Be careful!
[48:22.89]Using magic?
[48:28.31]Sorry, that was a Don Knotts moment.
[48:30.23]I had to run.
[48:33.03]I was about to hear the pallbearer.
[48:36.58]I suppressed it.
[48:48.18]Not the right spell.
[49:09.91]Oh, Grave Glovewart.
[49:26.26]Alright, remind me to go on top of the spikes after.
[49:29.02]This looks very, oh no, this is not going to be fun.
[49:34.16]That range.
[49:36.87]The ricochet is so cool and I know I'm going to get that spell, but this looks very, very bad.
[49:56.08]No, you don't do this to me right now.
[50:09.73]I can't move the camera.
[50:15.51]Wow.
[50:16.97]That was goofy.
[50:21.33]That would be so funny if they just killed you there.
[50:23.11]I'm almost sad that I did not die there.
[50:28.85]That's almost disappointing in a weird way.
[50:36.46]I'm just laughing about how... I'm thinking about that.
[50:39.02]Okay.
[50:59.99]Yeah, that's a perfect place to put just the... You died.
[51:04.97]There's so much more time for fall jokes, that's true.
[51:19.98]Shooting!
[51:35.21]All this isn't just flowers in here.
[51:36.99]I know is this.
[51:45.44]Electro charge.
[51:53.13]Am I gonna be still alive?
[51:54.07]Let's do the firecrackers.
[52:18.56]Don't let that happen again.
[52:23.31]What somebody just said?
[52:30.43]Hey.
[52:31.91]Don't let that happen again.
[52:32.85]I think that's all I can do in here.
[52:52.31]There's a ladder.
[53:07.98]I have to be more careful because I have no running out of heals here.
[53:27.21]Imagine dodging from that far away.
[53:35.79]Ghost glove ward.
[53:36.75]Just making sure.
[53:55.18]I'm going to put my head up and it's going to crush my head.
[53:59.65]Now that would be a real LOL moment.
[54:18.68]Where the hell am I now?
[54:25.13]The two dungeons like this I've done so far do feel a little more elaborate than the base game.
[54:32.82]Feels like they're a lot bigger.
[54:41.02]I feel like there's a lot more to do in them.
[54:44.58]There were obviously some exceptions.
[54:46.28]There was the chariot one, the poison swamp one.
[54:54.61]That chariot one sucked absolute asshole though.
[54:58.37]I've played through this game.
[54:59.25]Yeah, like probably like maybe a little bit more than a half dozen times.
[55:03.35]I've never done that dungeon ever again.
[55:06.38]I did it on stream and I have not seen the inside of that dungeon since.
[55:24.21]I'm going the wrong way.
[55:27.81]Am I?
[55:28.63]Is this back to the entrance, isn't it?
[55:30.15]Wait.
[55:32.15]I jumped off the thing.
[55:33.13]Hold on, let me pay attention for a second.
[55:39.72]Okay, so yeah, I gotta go down.
[55:44.53]There are three chariot dungeons.
[55:46.33]The one I'm thinking of is the one with the lava.
[55:52.36]And there's the snake enemies that are all over the place.
[56:06.09]Yeah, hero's grave, yeah.
[56:09.19]Okay, so where's progress then?
[56:11.13]I came, I looped back around.
[56:18.40]Okay, this is where we were.
[56:19.92]So do not go in the second hole.
[56:23.74]Hey.
[56:28.18]Yeah, it's so scary every time.
[56:29.94]Alright, so where do I go?
[56:33.28]It's close.
[56:41.79]Let me just look at it.
[56:43.95]I don't think I can fit in there.
[56:44.91]Yes, I can.
[56:54.94]And then it's across there.
[56:56.20]Is there one more spot over there?
[57:10.03]Oh, shit.
[57:10.59]There's another one.
[57:11.13]Okay.
[57:27.52]Oh, get away from me.
[57:35.54]Boss fight.
[57:39.27]Got it.
[57:44.99]Oh, claps in the chat.
[57:46.97]Claps.
[58:11.93]Oh, don't back roll.
[58:14.11]Don't back roll.
[58:15.33]That's death.
[58:16.09]There's nothing else over there.
[58:27.80]no I have so many drop why is it not coming down get the fuck away from me crush him crush him crush him holy shit wait is he still alive oh my god
[59:00.06]Oh, this place is so goofy, but I'm dead.
[59:08.14]I'm dead.
[59:12.98]Wait a minute.
[59:13.48]That's right.
[59:14.04]Okay.
[59:15.70]Okay.
[59:15.80]We're going to sit here for like five minutes.
[59:21.78]Do I have any more passive heals?
[59:28.77]I'm actually, I may have warming stones from a long time ago.
[59:39.18]I, oh my God, I have a shitload of warming stones.
[59:48.92]The problem is you need FP.
[59:53.64]Do I have enough FP to use one?
[59:57.39]I don't.
[59:58.43]I can't.
[59:59.05]I just have to sit here and let this thing heal me.
[60:02.66]Put on the skull guy's armor.
[60:04.02]Are you talking about Ensha?
[60:08.64]Does Ensha heal?
[60:09.92]HP?
[60:13.73]Where is Ensha?
[60:18.49]It does.
[60:18.81]Okay.
[60:22.97]Alright, now we're cooking.
[60:25.99]I actually don't hate this look either.
[60:33.60]Use a starlight shard.
[60:36.52]Oh, I do have starlight shards.
[60:50.66]Let me turn it up a little bit.
[60:51.60]Somebody was saying it was a little quiet, which I agree it is.
[60:57.76]Better.
[61:15.89]I look like a new age horror movie character.
[61:21.33]Coming soon mask radar.
[61:26.99]Skull Mask.
[61:28.70]In theaters.
[61:32.18]You know, they got a new guy.
[61:33.28]There's a new guy that does all the horror movie stuff now.
[61:34.82]And he goes like this.
[61:36.90]The Nun.
[61:38.80]The Nun 2.
[61:40.44]The Conjuring.
[61:43.80]Skull Mask.
[61:46.45]And it's really funny because a lot of times, that guy doesn't say anything else the entire trailer.
[61:52.20]He just says one word sometimes.
[61:56.14]In The Nun 2, I believe that guy just says... The Nun 2.
[62:01.24]That's it.
[62:04.47]The Nun.
[62:14.41]I have to... That seems like such a fun, interesting job.
[62:19.69]You just get like a dozen movie titles from whatever studios you're connected to, and it's just like, yep, here they are.
[62:24.65]You're going to sit there, and you're going to get the perfect... You have 12 titles to say, and you make sure that you're going to redo those, retake them a hundred times to make sure you get the perfect... See?
[62:37.67]That was a retake.
[62:38.37]The Nun.
[62:41.85]The Nun.
[62:44.80]That was alright.
[62:45.60]Could've used a little more inflection at the end.
[62:48.21]Yeah.
[62:48.67]Rated R. No, to me, you've only said Rated R once.
[62:53.49]You sat there for like two weeks straight, just like, just, I don't know, drinking fucking shitloads of booze and just like fucking hanging out or like just smoking weed or whatever and you're just like sitting there like, alright, here we go.
[63:06.71]Rated R. Nope.
[63:08.91]Rated R.
[63:11.06]rated r until you get the perfect one perfect it might take you a month straight to get it of like sleepless nights where you're just up just doing it but I think you only have recorded that once he's talking about weed again he mentioned weed what's your problem
[63:41.26]What's your problem?
[63:45.72]You've missed so much.
[63:50.16]Dude, this guy's like Pineapple Express.
[63:52.14]I talk about marijuana like once every like four months and I... No, I will not stand for this.
[64:09.02]Yeah, I enjoy fucking weed.
[64:12.18]You got a fucking problem?
[64:38.87]No!
[64:39.53]No, I didn't.
[64:40.65]I'm so far away.
[64:41.97]Oh, thank God.
[64:51.82]Thank God.
[64:53.02]I don't have to do the whole dungeon again.
[65:00.08]Oh, I wouldn't want to be in a dungeon with this guy.
[65:03.38]Yeah, I smoke weed.
[65:04.37]Fuck you, dude.
[65:06.04]Hey, let me lead the way.
[65:08.36]Oh, well, that guy's gone.
[65:10.78]All that depth perception and coordination.
[65:15.40]I wonder why.
[65:15.96]I have a lot of souls up there.
[65:22.54]Hold on.
[65:31.99]Angrily defending your weed position.
[65:35.68]To death.
[65:40.15]Just walking off a fucking cliff.
[65:53.86]It's so funny because it was such a... Like, that's the only place I could have fallen is right in that little section.
[66:01.07]Alright, who is it?
[66:03.51]Who am I gonna have to... Who am I gonna have to... Wait, who am I gonna have to kill in here?
[66:11.41]Oh my god!
[66:12.71]It's Godrick!
[66:13.73]It's Godfroy the Grafton!
[66:15.84]Death Knight?
[66:24.32]Ow.
[66:26.22]Holy shit.
[66:26.88]Alright, you've got an interesting attack pattern.
[66:30.96]It's a delay before you swing the double swing.
[66:34.55]I can see right through you.
[66:51.44]Hmm, he gets staggered by that.
[67:00.80]Today's far enough away.
[67:26.79]This thing is so good for chip damage.
[67:28.31]It really is.
[67:30.59]Whoa.
[67:30.95]Alright.
[67:46.69]That's a double.
[67:47.93]What the fuck?
[68:03.33]Alright, a little bit.
[68:04.17]OK, this delay on the second one.
[68:25.47]What the?
[68:27.73]Oh, that hurts a lot.
[68:29.49]Damn, OK.
[68:31.88]So that's a very long delay.
[68:33.22]And then what do you do?
[68:39.90]It's probably, yeah, it's probably jump.
[68:43.38]You know, let's be proactive about this.
[68:48.39]Let's go ahead and put on lightning resistance because that killed me from almost full health.
[68:55.77]I chopped you up in a beat grinder.
[68:57.09]Alright, let's let's just get it out of the way.
[69:04.26]This doesn't need to be here right now.
[69:05.68]I switched this out before the stream started.
[69:07.88]Um, let's go with the, yeah.
[69:10.39]Let's try to live a little longer here.
[69:23.68]Dude, you know how like Seinfeld on reruns gets like a check in the mail for every time that like Seinfeld is on like TV?
[69:33.63]How come I don't get that with the meat grinder clip?
[69:36.99]That thing's been played on, like, networks.
[69:39.61]That thing's been played, like, seven billion times.
[69:41.85]Where are my residuals for it?
[69:54.28]Actually, you know what?
[69:55.36]I have a new idea.
[70:01.08]This really fucks him up bad.
[70:07.78]He does not like this move at all.
[70:10.36]I think it's you come in the room and just go for it.
[70:36.34]Thankfully, the long wind-up time that he has actually makes getting a lot of things done easier.
[70:41.75]Whoa.
[70:52.02]Holy shit.
[70:59.28]He's got full health!
[71:01.15]Oh no!
[71:03.38]Alright, that's a heal.
[71:04.74]He's got a couple different grabs, it seems.
[71:12.12]He has two grabs.
[71:15.02]One takes a lot longer than the other.
[71:23.57]No, what the fuck, dude?
[71:24.77]Why didn't I do it?
[71:25.45]That's the, I'm, I gotta, like, this is part of the routine.
[71:33.60]If you're not ready, you're not ready.
[71:40.40]Just trying some shit.
[72:02.05]He was in that for a long time.
[72:10.00]uh-oh oh that's bad
[72:40.87]Whoa, what just happened?
[72:47.45]Shit, I gotta be much, much better about that move.
[73:09.45]Oh, I thought that was it.
[73:10.23]Thank God.
[73:24.84]Alright, here comes the lightning shit.
[73:26.58]I think I'm gonna go for the jump.
[73:38.55]Oh, he does it twice!
[74:13.72]Oh, I'm out of stamina.
[74:21.96]Ah, shit.
[74:22.86]I tried to dodge.
[74:34.75]I'm in trouble now.
[74:36.75]Look at that full fucking heal.
[74:38.33]Oh, man.
[74:38.87]Oh, man.
[74:39.31]Really?
[74:39.61]Alright.
[74:40.43]Let me just keep looking at the moves then.
[74:44.61]You get... Alright.
[74:45.24]You get grabbed by that, that's... That's game over if you get grabbed.
[74:48.80]It's just... Just turn off the computer.
[74:50.68]Just unplug the controller.
[75:15.03]Oh my god, it's an insta-kill move and you get a stun on him!
[75:23.25]Fuck!
[75:24.91]Okay, it's like... He does this... He goes down, he gets all white and black.
[75:36.03]And then it's a little bit... It's like a hair longer than you think it is.
[75:47.34]Try the parry.
[75:48.87]That's how I beat the other guy.
[75:52.45]The boys would clear here.
[75:56.05]That's Godwyn in the background, by the way.
[75:58.29]Is this... Is this Godwyn?
[75:59.83]Is this like a God... Like... That's... I just realized right now this is Godwyn right here.
[76:13.86]I didn't even notice the Godwyn face.
[76:17.93]I'm like more interested in that right now than the fight.
[76:26.95]Oh man, that's amazing.
[76:28.91]I need to do that way more often.
[76:48.08]Bad dodging.
[77:09.81]Jump!
[77:10.59]It's jump, not... It's not that move.
[77:27.51]Thought that was going to stagger him.
[77:46.28]No, wrong one.
[78:17.94]What the?
[78:18.46]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[78:19.97]What?
[78:20.31]What?
[78:20.75]What?
[78:21.83]What?
[78:23.17]I jumped over it.
[78:24.75]What did it hit?
[78:25.35]What hit me?
[78:27.63]What happened?
[78:28.69]What happened?
[78:29.17]Why did it hit me?
[78:32.34]I jumped over it.
[78:33.58]I landed on the ground and it hit me.
[78:37.03]What the fuck are you talking about, video game?
[78:39.85]I jumped right over it.
[78:42.13]Is Mambo time?
[78:49.87]That was a fake reaction.
[78:53.59]What?
[78:54.45]No, that was a real reaction.
[78:56.01]That was a... I...
[78:58.89]What what no way guys guys what?
[79:05.78]No, that was fucking stupid You want to fuck around you want to fuck around with the bug You want to fuck around with the bug That's what they call me
[79:36.53]Oh, I have a really good move!
[79:38.01]Oh, that's really cool!
[79:38.63]That's not a bug move!
[79:52.15]Eat shit!
[80:13.11]Whoa!
[80:25.16]For all my fog brethren!
[80:46.71]Thank you.
[81:39.76]No!
[82:26.17]Fuck you!
[82:27.29]No!
[82:28.45]The fucking warming stone!
[82:30.72]Oh, the fucking warming... The warming stone... Ruined... Everything.
[82:45.73]I threw a fucking... Why is this... God damn it!
[82:54.20]Ugh!
[82:57.21]What the hell would you do that for?
[82:58.52]I'm in the middle of an intense battle.
[83:02.90]Oh my God.
[83:04.44]Oops.
[83:10.90]That was such a good fight too.
[83:13.04]Ruined by this.
[83:41.15]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[83:44.59]If you could see my face, good thing you can't because it's purple.
[83:49.96]I got this motherfucker.
[83:51.12]And this was such a, that was such a clutch move too.
[83:54.72]Pulling out the 20% Estus Blast thing.
[83:58.18]Oh, I was trying to get a stagger and I couldn't get it.
[84:00.24]I'm so fucking annoyed.
[84:30.89]Fucking fuck this motherfucker!
[84:45.08]Dude, what the?
[84:45.94]That move is so stupid!
[84:54.05]That move is dumb.
[85:00.93]Okay.
[85:02.56]What's going on with that move?
[85:05.40]He does this thing.
[85:06.40]Lightning is on the ground.
[85:08.10]It's on the ground for longer than you can get away from it.
[85:13.99]He does it, I jump, and even when I land, I still get hit for 92% of my entire health bar.
[85:26.12]It's after the swing.
[85:28.10]Alright, so after he swings, you're going to wait like a second or two?
[85:31.24]I feel like that's scary.
[85:33.09]That's too scary for me.
[85:34.01]I'm not doing it.
[85:34.51]Alright, that one I got to burn into memory, too.
[85:43.81]This is a restart, I think.
[85:46.40]Yeah, just restart it.
[85:47.00]The lightning on the ground shows where it's gonna hit.
[85:54.90]It's so hard to pay attention to that, too.
[85:56.64]It's just like, because he swings?
[85:59.26]He does a sword swing.
[86:01.64]So, effectively, you have to worry about getting hit by the sword, and then all the lightning dog shit all over the ground.
[86:07.36]Okay, this is a real attempt.
[86:30.55]you
[87:05.93]Shit, I'm panicking.
[87:35.56]Oh, my God.
[88:41.85]Thank fucking God for that flask.
[88:54.52]No!
[88:59.74]No, dude, why did he do that right there of all the times to do it?
[89:06.57]Why of all the times to do that move?
[89:10.24]It was right fucking there.
[89:11.64]Oh, man.
[89:13.86]I was just banking on the fact that he wasn't gonna do it.
[89:18.87]Oh, now I'm so sad.
[89:39.15]I have no mana.
[89:42.93]Yeah, I'm in trouble now.
[89:50.35]I can't fucking believe.
[89:51.40]I just got so screwed by him doing that.
[89:54.38]He does it like two times the entire fight, and he did it the one time that I was doing that move.
[90:03.85]Hey, it ain't over.
[90:30.71]It ain't over yet!
[90:32.94]I'm still standing!
[90:48.85]Oh, now it's over.
[90:53.64]Oh, that's so sad.
[90:56.64]I was... I can't believe he did that fucking move.
[91:03.31]I can do it, yeah.
[91:11.36]Actually, hold on.
[91:12.02]Let me... We got to go for it.
[91:16.22]I got to put on some lightning resist.
[91:17.93]I think I have... It's already pretty much on.
[91:25.95]This thing's kind of ugly though, isn't it?
[91:32.18]This keeps replaying in my head.
[91:33.72]What the fuck happened?
[91:45.09]I just let up a grand slam.
[91:46.87]But I'm still pitching, so I gotta... I gotta get over it.
[91:52.69]I gotta get over it.
[91:53.75]I almost beat him twice, and I got bullshitted two times.
[91:57.53]I gotta get over it.
[91:58.79]I gotta get over it.
[92:12.19]Okay, it's time for the champion of the Elden Ring to show himself once and for all.
[92:18.19]What does he look like?
[92:28.39]Let's go!
[92:47.00]Oh, my God.
[93:14.04]This one's for all the mosquitoes.
[93:16.18]This one's for all the fucking beetles in the world.
[93:21.25]They don't fucking listen to us.
[93:22.37]They don't like us.
[93:23.09]They try to crush us under their shoes.
[93:28.42]Not today.
[93:56.86]Oh, my God.
[94:34.33]Holy shit, in my fucking underwear!
[94:57.86]What the fuck just happened?
[95:30.47]Die, motherfucker!
[95:31.49]This is for the bugs!
[95:45.12]What would a neighbor think?
[96:00.76]talking to what is going on what's happening in that fucking room who am I who am I like torturing it who am I like beating up in here but but this is for the bugs what bugs why what are you talking about man settle down you're gonna be alright what
[96:28.42]Yeah, shit in my underpants?
[96:29.96]I don't know, man.
[96:30.88]I stopped trying to figure it out a long time ago.
[96:33.88]Just kind of accepted this is the way it was.
[96:41.91]They might think you're really just getting into a video game.
[96:49.71]That was crazy.
[96:50.81]That fight sucked, but it was fun.
[96:53.67]Okay, here's something with the DLC.
[96:56.91]I have a statement to make.
[96:59.93]All these fights suck.
[97:03.80]But they're so fun.
[97:09.40]And the actual characters and the actual music and the choreography of their moveset.
[97:15.96]It's so fun to play even though they're very hard and the fights are terrible.
[97:20.19]Well, that's not the right way to... That's the wrong word.
[97:23.19]They're amazing fights.
[97:24.33]They're just very punishing.
[97:30.05]Not suck as in it's bad, but suck as in, oh, that sucked.
[97:36.29]If that makes any sense.
[97:42.66]They're painful.
[97:43.38]Yeah, yeah, they're painful.
[97:48.97]That's a really not good clip to have.
[97:51.27]Okay, here's what I think about the DLC.
[97:53.59]All the fights suck.
[97:54.63]End the clip.
[97:55.51]Yeah, thanks.
[97:56.55]Appreciate it.
[97:57.88]Appreciate this community.
[97:59.16]Yeah.
[98:00.56]You're going to clip me and you're going to make me sound like I'm an asshole.
[98:08.44]That was awesome.
[98:09.28]I don't even know what the hell I just got.
[98:11.99]Boost maximum HP by the utmost.
[98:19.22]Well, that's true.
[98:19.90]I did have a much better clippable moment there, right, for you.
[98:25.22]About 2,000 or 3,000 people did the clip button when I said I was going to poop my pants or whatever it was.
[98:31.86]And that puts you on clip cooldown for a minute.
[98:35.04]So you may have walked out of the room.
[98:36.84]Maybe you're on clip cooldown.
[98:38.18]You don't really care.
[98:38.92]And it's like, yeah, that was kind of dumb, but I don't care.
[98:41.90]Yeah.
[98:42.14]So you get to be on clip cooldown.
[98:45.55]Throw in some distractions and then they won't clip you.
[98:49.39]Alright.
[98:49.71]This is cool.
[98:50.86]It's a faith weapon, though.
[98:51.98]Of course it is.
[98:55.70]Death Knight's twin.
[98:56.80]It's another dual wielding.
[99:01.80]Is every new weapon in the DLC a dual wield?
[99:08.91]It feels like it.
[99:24.51]Yeah.
[99:26.67]And they all have crazy movesets.
[99:37.82]Can you show where this is on the map?
[99:39.41]Absolutely.
[99:42.47]It is here.
[99:43.51]Fog Rift Catacombs.
[99:47.69]You get there by going up here and then you have to go through here.
[99:53.26]So you don't go all the way.
[99:54.28]You go like through this little section up here.
[100:00.36]Okay.
[100:01.44]Very cool.
[100:02.44]Very, very awesome.
[100:04.44]I wonder how much health this gives.
[100:10.61]Crimson medallion plus three.
[100:15.07]These medallions of the largest variety were conferred to Godwyn's inner circle of distinguished golden knights.
[100:24.88]Am I seeing that right?
[100:26.14]Hold on a second.
[100:29.74]Oh, that's not bad.
[100:33.81]I would prefer the other one, honestly.
[100:35.03]Okay, wait, actually, what did I have on before, really?
[100:39.77]Was it this, right?
[100:40.33]I feel like I want that on.
[100:47.34]That wasn't Godwyn himself.
[100:48.66]That was a Godwyn knight.
[100:49.84]So Godwyn is still kind of like this.
[100:54.90]Or at least this is another Godwyn.
[100:57.12]Because there are two, three, two or three, four of them in the base game.
[101:10.03]Read the axe.
[101:12.34]Yeah, that's not Godwyn.
[101:14.02]I'm just saying, like, this face here is Godwyn.
[101:17.90]Or an attempt at Godwyn.
[101:30.23]Yeah, the night once the personal guard of Godwyn was also the protector of the Prince of Death's cadaver surrogate.
[101:35.35]Yeah.
[101:39.21]But there's a few of these, though.
[101:46.02]What mysteries lie in the Elden Ring?
[101:55.52]He's not going to show off the cool lightning axe?
[101:57.56]Oh, I can't.
[102:00.21]I would.
[102:00.83]Trust me, I would show off the moveset, but I'm a very high intelligence, low faith boy.
[102:12.13]Oh.
[102:15.12]Which I think I need to respec.
[102:18.98]Because I think I want to go like 50 int and then like 40 dex.
[102:26.33]I think this weapon would do better.
[102:34.42]You're too smart to hold an axe.
[102:36.72]You can test the moveset of any weapon.
[102:38.24]Yeah, but it won't do the weapon art.
[102:42.13]You can test the moveset, you just can't see the actual weapon art or whatever it is.
[102:47.69]Alright, so we were going here.
[102:49.54]I'm going to continue to do that because it's a map fragment.
[103:01.46]This is bugs.
[103:03.98]You step on us.
[103:06.03]You crush us.
[103:06.93]You think we're nothing to you.
[103:08.67]Does that imply that a bug lives here?
[103:12.67]Or am I like with the bugs?
[103:14.55]I... I don't know.
[103:18.23]Huh.
[103:24.47]I think it's all... I think it's up there.
[103:26.23]I'm not sure I can get over here from here.
[103:38.35]Unless... No, this is just going to go back down...
[103:42.28]Can I go this way?
[103:45.86]King of the bugs.
[103:50.64]Oh, I didn't even turn on the face cam for that.
[103:52.28]Yeah, probably for the best.
[103:54.05]I looked like shit.
[103:59.05]That's funny.
[103:59.59]So he's pointing over there.
[104:08.99]Okay, well, I'm just going to go up this way.
[104:12.41]I think we have to go over that big area.
[104:21.77]Unless I'm missing something.
[104:27.99]But it's okay.
[104:47.95]You have your gamer glasses on?
[104:54.12]I do.
[104:55.06]I actually do.
[105:03.66]Yeah, especially when it gets to be this kind of golden hour.
[105:06.03]My FPS drops to like 40.
[105:09.15]Okay, let's go up here.
[105:28.04]Jerma freaking hates the new DLC.
[105:31.60]I actually love it.
[105:34.24]I love the new DLC.
[105:37.36]I can explore this now.
[105:43.24]Let me finish the rest of my smoothie.
[105:56.47]I need those oats.
[106:09.66]How many bosses down?
[106:12.29]Ooh, actually really needed that.
[106:16.69]Uh, technically just the one, I think, right?
[106:20.26]I've done a lot of the side content bosses.
[106:22.86]But only one of the main, it seems like, main bosses.
[106:33.46]Is it weird that I want to wait till it's kind of darker to explore here so I have like a 50, 60 FPS?
[106:38.38]I think I already got most of the stuff here.
[107:01.93]There's this side that I didn't see.
[107:03.67]Oh shit.
[107:15.71]It's Marika Monks.
[107:23.57]The box was in the way.
[107:35.39]the real mvp of that fight was this weapon and I know this weapon doesn't hit very hard but wow they're so excited for me to be here thank you what an entrance like that you're gonna do I feel like a king what are you doing what are you doing why are you fighting me what are you I thought
[108:18.66]Ahahahaha!
[108:36.59]Gravity magic is so strong.
[108:39.29]You could just get the meteorite staff, buff the hell out of it, and just kill people in one hit.
[109:05.44]You're going to do a new run?
[109:06.50]I got to get to the first one first.
[109:14.95]I like to... Fire Spark Perfume Bottle.
[109:26.55]They've given attention to some of the goofy builds.
[109:29.05]There's a lot of people right now that are perfumer Andes who just stood up, clapped once, took a big sigh, and then sat back down.
[109:55.39]Oh, right.
[109:55.87]I have all this weird shit on.
[110:04.42]How does lightning resist?
[110:14.74]That's quite a cool outfit.
[110:17.42]I could go back to the original.
[110:41.96]mushroom arms okay I just have a big warts on my hands no longer a bug what the hell I'm the champion of the bugs
[111:15.04]It's, the game's like too beautiful.
[111:17.50]All the lighting, everything's so bright and so colorful and so beautiful.
[111:28.67]Yeah, you're, I'm a bug delegate.
[111:30.05]That's right.
[111:35.40]I think I got pretty much everything.
[111:36.68]Time to go right in the front door.
[111:38.04]And if there's a Grace, I'm going to be happy because then I'm going to go and grab a drink, use the bathroom.
[111:45.03]And, uh, but I could go over here.
[111:50.41]Now we're going to, let's go up the front door here.
[111:54.79]I want to, I need to commit.
[112:04.67]To get off the horse?
[112:09.71]I wonder if this is just a boss.
[112:11.56]Like, right now.
[112:13.18]Bridge boss?
[112:15.14]I think so.
[112:17.04]Castle Ensus.
[112:27.17]Okay.
[112:32.05]I think it's just a caster giant.
[112:33.59]Oh, my God.
[112:42.11]Let's get that stagger if we can.
[113:22.60]I think I'm going to do the bubble bath.
[113:25.32]Let's give this guy a bubble bath.
[113:58.59]There we go.
[114:01.77]Whatever.
[114:15.99]Converse Smithing Stone.
[114:17.67]Royal magic grease.
[114:36.84]Cool.
[114:36.94]Let's go inside door first.
[114:42.34]I need a Grace.
[114:51.82]oh thank you these are rayo lucario people
[115:27.48]How come you're killing them?
[115:29.92]I walked in to say hello and the guy started casting death spells at me.
[115:46.55]Yeah, the troll was wearing a carrion helm, yeah.
[116:04.82]Oh.
[116:09.96]Somebody is running next to me.
[116:11.40]I heard you from a mile away.
[116:13.27]I have both earphones in today.
[116:39.72]Cave or stairs?
[116:42.12]Cave or stairs?
[116:43.41]Let's go cave.
[116:47.04]Everyone just spams attacks, takes zero skill.
[116:51.46]Uh, okay.
[117:07.87]I'm not a spammer.
[117:29.14]That move is crazy.
[117:32.44]Okay, I actually have to be very careful now.
[117:33.94]These guys look very bad.
[117:36.20]Wait, there's a Mikkola thing!
[117:37.14]Please don't kill me!
[117:39.24]Jump over the rock!
[117:42.82]Ooh!
[117:43.93]Touch it!
[117:45.98]Cool.
[117:48.56]I found one.
[118:10.63]Hey, it's okay.
[118:11.19]I know where that is.
[118:19.92]Alright, I found a Grace.
[118:20.58]I am going to be right back.
[118:24.04]I'm going to pee.
[118:25.62]Stretch a little bit.
[118:26.52]I can do more damage now.
[118:30.68]I had enough to do these.
[118:31.56]I just did it before the stream started.
[118:35.92]I will be right back.
[118:37.72]Also, I really hate to say this, but I think...
[118:50.12]I maybe not.
[118:51.12]I'll see if I can handle it for a little while longer.
[118:55.16]The I almost want to.
[118:57.74]Put the stream down back to like 900 P. People laughing at that is so funny.
[119:15.26]Like, holy shit, dude.
[119:16.64]You can't even stream at 1080.
[119:19.28]You suck.
[119:20.20]Like, laugh out loud.
[119:26.73]At least with this game, it's... You can... Especially in the open areas, it's struggling.
[119:31.61]And I need as much available resources, I think, as I can get.
[119:34.57]Let's see.
[119:40.33]If it stays, like... Because this... I would call this 30.
[119:42.23]Like, 35. 35.
[119:45.03]And I feel like it's not... If I lower the settings a little, it won't be like that.
[119:49.66]It's fine indoors.
[119:50.50]It's fine in a condensed area, but... Changing the resolution is not going to improve the frames.
[120:05.97]I feel like it's going to free up some CPU.
[120:08.75]I don't know.
[120:10.45]Just making it up at this point.
[120:21.66]Bitrate is the same, so it's doing the same throughput.
[120:25.02]That's true, but it's also rendering a 1920 by 1080 canvas rather than a, like, 864p canvas.
[120:34.79]Now, this could just be absolute cope, and it has nothing to do with anything, but I'm curious.
[120:42.31]Alright, I'll be right back.
[120:43.25]I'm going to go P. Take a stretch for a little bit.
[120:46.83]Stretch break.
[121:11.53]I'm still here.
[121:12.09]Somebody said Jerm is using zoomer vocabulary now.
[121:16.43]What was it?
[121:17.77]I am very.
[121:18.37]I'm actually like I'm really curious.
[121:20.07]What was the word?
[121:24.00]What was the word?
[121:30.06]Hope.
[121:36.94]Oh really?
[121:42.85]You say drip, too.
[121:44.67]Everybody says that.
[121:47.05]I'm a streamer, guys.
[121:47.75]I have to keep up with the times.
[121:49.66]Well, I'm an ex-streamer.
[121:50.86]I'm an ex-streamer.
[121:52.64]I gotta keep up with the times.
[121:57.36]Okay, if I say howdy-dowdy, people go, boomer, boomer, vernacular, boomer language.
[122:04.97]And if I say cope, drip, that's zoomer, idiot.
[122:14.01]You know what?
[122:14.81]I'm going to make up my own new words.
[122:19.20]Be right back.
[126:56.18]Hello.
[127:17.25]Alright.
[127:20.28]Cool.
[127:22.80]Where am I?
[127:24.34]I am here.
[127:25.94]Castle Ensys.
[127:28.54]Go in the door.
[127:32.24]Alright, so I found one of these.
[127:33.18]Do I have to do anything with it?
[127:34.62]I abandon here the flesh of my body.
[127:39.21]What does it look like?
[127:39.91]Is there anything on the ground?
[127:48.69]I think it's just blood.
[127:49.73]Oh no, there's little chunks flying around.
[127:57.96]Nice milk voice.
[128:01.36]Yeah.
[128:03.86]Fuck up.
[128:17.99]Oh, he's... This guy's mad.
[128:27.26]Not resin.
[128:30.72]Okay, we're kind of going... I guess we're going this way because I can't get back up.
[128:35.58]It's my fault for not thinking ahead and planning ahead.
[128:45.69]You know what the fuck I'm doing.
[128:47.43]Okay.
[129:07.58]stop it stop stop I swear if this dog kills me
[129:39.18]Boys, look behind you.
[129:43.88]Oh, my God.
[129:44.56]A wallaby.
[129:45.20]Whoa.
[129:48.18]Wallaby.
[129:48.86]Aww.
[129:53.04]I'm just kidding.
[130:07.03]I almost didn't jump, but I'm glad I at the very last second decided to press X. Look at this bird.
[130:18.40]I love this bird.
[130:21.94]It's my treasure.
[130:24.22]It's mine.
[130:27.76]No one will take my shiny seed.
[130:31.49]What's that?
[130:31.81]What's that?
[130:32.89]What's that?
[130:41.17]Starlight shards?
[130:48.97]All that for a couple of starlight shards?
[130:53.39]Yes, do not mishear me.
[130:55.61]I said starlight shards because I'm annoyed.
[130:59.44]If I was happy about that, I would say it differently.
[131:05.44]Is there nothing else here?
[131:10.66]It's got to be like a little drop down or something, right?
[131:20.57]I guess not.
[131:21.51]I guess it really was just some stuff.
[131:23.05]Actually, they're very, very good.
[131:24.86]They're very useful when you need them.
[131:30.26]And that is just death.
[131:40.58]Oh, are you showing me something?
[131:42.10]What do you want to show me?
[131:45.23]You want me to go this way?
[131:47.43]Okay.
[131:52.89]Are you coming?
[131:53.29]I just want to stuff my face into this.
[132:05.13]Like an ostrich.
[132:11.31]Turtles.
[132:20.06]This feels.
[132:23.08]Like a fight arena.
[132:41.76]I would just live here.
[132:42.96]Just right here.
[132:44.23]This is all I need.
[132:47.51]I just need this and some lightning.
[132:52.53]Storms all the time.
[132:53.55]Yeah, but Jerma, what about you?
[132:59.21]Where are you going to get your mail?
[133:01.55]Oh, shut up.
[133:04.38]But like, I do think I need to have to worry about that.
[133:19.06]Nobody said that?
[133:21.48]Somebody was.
[133:22.52]Somebody thought it.
[133:25.24]Somebody thought it and that was enough to piss me off.
[133:31.77]Would you bathe and drink from the same source?
[133:33.83]Have you played City Skylines?
[133:37.99]No, you shit and piss right here.
[133:41.31]And then you drink from right here.
[134:07.47]What about the guy that lives two rivers down?
[134:10.63]I don't fucking know that guy.
[134:17.85]What do you mean?
[134:19.19]We'll work together.
[134:20.31]I don't know.
[134:25.65]I don't know.
[134:26.05]I would tell him.
[134:27.75]I'd be like, hey.
[134:29.71]Hey, Tim.
[134:30.65]Just letting you know.
[134:31.33]Hey, Tim.
[134:32.59]If we're close enough, I'll scream.
[134:34.08]Hey, Tim.
[134:35.98]About to take a shit.
[134:38.38]Okay, thanks, Jeremy.
[134:40.78]Yeah, don't eat or drink anything out of this water for a week.
[134:46.20]It's going to take at least two weeks of natural erosion to get rid of it.
[134:50.62]Thank you.
[134:51.96]Ooh, love to be your neighbor.
[134:57.27]That's not what happened.
[135:07.85]What if you had an HOA?
[135:09.11]Ooh.
[135:17.89]That's helpful.
[135:25.61]Are you taking a dump once every two weeks?
[135:33.92]Well, it's the only one he knows about.
[135:38.17]Oh, thanks, neighbor.
[135:40.71]Thanks for letting me know.
[135:42.46]Yeah, you're welcome.
[135:45.66]Wow, that neighbor of mine, I wonder who he is.
[135:48.34]Some kind of alien.
[135:50.20]He only goes to the bathroom once every two weeks.
[136:09.31]These guys are the strongest enemy in the DLC so far.
[136:13.60]Besides the dual welding, that ancient place with the scorpions.
[136:38.15]At least I can go in the front door.
[136:43.60]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[137:06.13]Jumping attack.
[137:09.84]Did I lose 100,000 souls?
[137:10.92]No, no, no, no.
[137:13.08]I leveled up, right?
[137:13.88]Did I?
[137:14.18]No, I did.
[137:16.38]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[137:16.92]I did.
[137:17.14]I was like just talking and doing it.
[137:24.05]No, you lost them.
[137:24.89]Did I?
[137:26.49]No.
[137:28.47]I don't even... I don't remember if I did or not.
[137:30.43]Oh.
[137:40.08]Just shit in little quantities.
[137:44.22]No, that's awful.
[137:49.71]No, we would have a place where we would do it.
[137:57.89]We would all shit in a pipe.
[138:00.42]And that pipe would go all the way down to one spot in the river.
[138:05.40]And I'm just making a sewer system.
[138:12.78]Turns out sewer system is a good idea, I guess.
[138:18.14]You're just in a city again, yeah.
[138:21.50]Yeah, then we would connect some other pipes to some porcelain faucets that make it easier to get cleaner water out of a more accessible location.
[138:39.83]And then we would have to elect officials
[138:43.39]to decide when we can and cannot shit in the water, right?
[138:46.42]So we'd have to get at least 10 to 20 of us that lived around to make a system.
[138:56.65]These guys are invisible.
[139:00.45]Your fit sucks, dude.
[139:01.97]Yeah?
[139:04.08]You really think so?
[139:36.52]I almost... I could have caught him.
[139:37.90]I'm so sorry.
[139:39.72]I could have caught you.
[139:42.49]You probably would have been OK.
[139:52.33]You don't care about them?
[139:53.60]Yes, I do.
[139:54.48]Yeah.
[139:59.68]Fuck are you kidding me?
[140:10.22]Who's that?
[140:28.38]These are the these guys are tough.
[140:34.40]I gotta get you in a stagger.
[140:35.82]There we go.
[140:42.01]Oh, I have a lot of smithing stones.
[140:53.27]What Elden Ring boss do you think you could befriend if you were stuck in this universe?
[141:03.56]Oh.
[141:07.54]Probably Gideon.
[141:09.18]Either Gideon.
[141:09.79]I could befriend Gideon very easily, I think.
[141:13.45]We both know everything.
[141:15.59]We would just share back and forth all the stuff that we know.
[141:36.64]I think I'm ready to move.
[141:42.12]Am I ready to move?
[141:48.65]I'm ready to move.
[141:49.41]I thought that was an item.
[141:50.79]Okay, let's go.
[141:57.39]Um...
[142:00.31]Goldmask, I think I would get along with.
[142:03.39]I feel like Goldmask you could just do anything with and you do not know if or if not he is even your friend, but you're just hanging out.
[142:10.58]He's just pointing at stuff.
[142:12.96]And you're like, yeah, bro.
[142:15.20]Nice.
[142:16.72]And you just, you could do anything.
[142:18.26]You could just hang out and sit on a couch.
[142:21.73]Just sit Goldmask on a couch and put on friends.
[142:24.59]And he's just pointing at it.
[142:25.73]You're like, oh, I love Frost.
[142:57.08]Holy moly!
[143:00.04]That's a lot of damage.
[143:02.14]Do not get hit by more than one of those.
[143:24.04]Trying to drink.
[143:24.64]Oh no!
[143:33.17]That was a pallbearer moment.
[143:44.45]I got way too overconfident in the end there.
[143:52.46]What Elden Ring boss would be the best to get high with?
[143:57.75]Astel.
[144:02.07]Astel would be like... Oh, man.
[144:07.55]Oh, man.
[144:08.09]He'd be like, oh, man.
[144:10.25]How you doing, man?
[144:11.43]I don't know.
[144:12.07]I'm freaking out right now.
[144:14.13]I'm freaking out.
[144:15.06]I'm freaking out.
[144:15.82]And then he would just take off and just do an obliteration beam onto a planet somewhere.
[144:20.06]And he'd be like, whoa!
[144:24.46]I don't know.
[144:24.94]I'm freaking out.
[144:26.56]That planet had a face.
[144:27.99]That planet had a face.
[144:29.29]You don't understand.
[144:50.90]Hey, I brought the entire zone.
[144:53.04]Are you ready to fight again?
[144:54.18]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[144:56.95]Having fun?
[145:01.11]Fight him.
[145:07.37]Fight him.
[145:09.09]Why can't you fight each other?
[145:10.83]Not fight each other.
[145:11.73]Fight.
[145:12.37]Fight.
[145:18.22]Oh, God.
[145:19.84]No, I need my souls.
[145:23.34]I got killed by the guy that literally throws Q-tips at you.
[145:29.74]Okay, so let's do this again.
[145:48.06]I'll tell you who I don't want to hang out with under any circumstances.
[145:51.50]Is Vare.
[145:53.16]Under any circumstance.
[145:55.12]Oh dude, you want to like get drunk with Vare?
[145:56.62]Nope.
[145:57.10]Do you want to get high with him?
[145:57.94]Nope.
[145:58.58]Do you want to be in the same room as him?
[146:00.35]Nope.
[146:01.79]Nope.
[146:07.37]Do you want to like play Mario Party with Vare?
[146:09.57]Nope.
[146:12.10]And it's crazy because I would play Mario Party with every other, even if they're villains.
[146:16.04]Like terrible villains.
[146:29.67]Vare would get way too existential about everything.
[146:35.76]He would bring up all kinds of fucking shit that you just don't want to hear.
[146:39.14]He'd be talking about all kinds of crazy shit.
[146:50.78]What about the Dung Eater?
[146:51.66]Alright.
[146:55.48]Would I play Mario Party with the Dung Eater?
[146:57.82]That's a great question.
[147:02.28]What character is... Is he picking?
[147:05.24]That's important.
[147:06.58]What character is Dung Eater picking?
[147:13.20]Wario?
[147:17.28]Hmm.
[147:17.60]Hmm.
[147:19.30]Okay, if he had picked Luigi, I would think I would be okay with it.
[147:24.06]But if you're picking Wario and you're the Dung Eater, I'm not so sure about that.
[147:47.85]You...
[147:48.29]Piece of shit.
[147:49.55]It's you doing that.
[147:53.59]Oh dear.
[147:55.69]I'm going to let's go inside.
[148:12.62]Can I fight you in the high FPS room?
[148:16.36]Ooh, Rolana's cameo.
[148:22.05]Hey everyone, it's Rolana.
[148:23.73]Just want to say hi.
[148:24.55]Heard it was your birthday.
[148:26.17]Heard your anniversary was this week and wow, 10 years.
[148:31.43]I'm not the only person that's made that joke, right?
[148:32.99]I hope I am.
[148:36.01]I can't be the only one.
[148:47.21]Got nothing left
[149:04.38]Oh, shit.
[149:05.59]Oh, shit.
[149:06.37]Oh, shit.
[149:09.29]Damn.
[149:40.48]Moonrithel Night Sword.
[149:42.38]That looks like intelligence to me.
[149:45.40]It's a big sword.
[149:50.89]It's a colossal sword, though.
[149:54.79]Tremendous phalanx.
[149:57.81]Moonrithel was the twin moon knight's chamberlain.
[150:01.95]She was also a friend of the trolls who served the royal family and proudly wielded their weapons as she fought arm in arm with her gargantuan comrades.
[150:33.86]Sneeze.
[151:06.11]So immersive.
[151:13.66]Cool alright, I've made it in here.
[151:16.36]Now what is in here?
[151:22.66]Oh Marika.
[151:23.36]I beg embrace your child.
[151:31.49]And give us a sign.
[151:37.08]How long must this holy war stretch on?
[151:47.67]Embrace your child.
[151:49.87]Oh, I want to see.
[151:50.45]What is that?
[151:52.87]Enhances attacks executed after maintaining the same stance for a while?
[151:56.89]Talisman featuring a gallant portrait of Rolana, the Twin Moon Knight.
[152:06.86]Enhances attacks executed after maintaining the same stance for a certain length of time.
[152:10.66]What does that mean?
[152:13.46]Same stance?
[152:21.09]Maybe a subclass thing?
[152:25.21]Engraved as a reminder of the unparalleled devotion of those who left their homelands to serve Rolano.
[152:31.55]While you leave, we will accompany you wherever your lunar vessel takes you.
[152:37.55]Firefly.
[152:39.82]Flintstone Firefly.
[152:41.64]Look at how cute this thing is.
[152:42.56]It works on Moonvale when you sheath it.
[152:57.30]So if you stay sheathed, and just kind of slowly move, you'll build up attack power or something?
[153:11.60]after one second so it's just like one two now it's at full oh that's kind of cool I heard you coming that's why I did that
[153:45.50]Kind of in trouble.
[153:49.95]Is there Grace right here?
[153:51.05]Not really.
[153:52.87]Oh, hold on.
[154:05.81]We're going to warming stone.
[154:13.58]Time don't put it on my bar.
[154:22.07]Are there guns in this game?
[154:23.31]Kinda.
[154:43.76]Is it just a handgun?
[154:46.52]Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.
[155:04.87]Shortcut or new part of the map?
[155:29.32]do, Jim.
[155:29.84]Uh-oh.
[155:35.32]Hold on.
[155:35.74]Don't be a fool.
[155:40.82]From all the way over here, really?
[155:42.66]Okay.
[155:43.42]Two can play at that game.
[156:23.00]Oh, right between the eyes.
[156:31.51]Oh, right in the... I got him in both eyes.
[156:33.57]That's why he can't see.
[156:34.69]He can't do anything.
[156:49.69]How much damage am I doing to him?
[156:54.35]He's still alive.
[156:55.13]Never mind.
[157:25.04]The next boss is going to be the whole stream, by the way.
[157:27.46]Oh, okay.
[157:29.84]We'll see.
[157:45.67]think he knew somebody was here I think this guy was just kind of walking around he's like oh oh it's this guy that we keep hearing about I think that guy was just coming down here to like go his car
[158:23.22]Dead.
[158:45.59]First check here.
[159:01.35]That is so weird that they're giving these smithing stones.
[159:05.67]Somber Smithing Stone two, Smithing Stone three, four, three.
[159:11.14]I feel like most people at this point in the game can just buy them for like 300 runes each.
[159:16.45]Because of all the new weapons.
[159:23.75]Yeah, that's true.
[159:24.31]But I mean, you could just go to that place in Mohg's Palace and just mow down those barf drinker likes and get 100,000 souls and just buy every Smithing Stone in 10 minutes.
[159:35.18]That should reward you somehow.
[159:44.74]I mean, I guess it's almost like a good reminder that, hey, you need these, by the way, because you're going to be probably using a different weapon.
[159:56.45]Okay, is that everything besides over here?
[159:59.05]I feel like there's got to be something else here, right?
[160:16.67]Other side of this.
[160:19.94]Just like go, I guess just go down.
[160:21.38]Why did I miss a place to go?
[160:44.88]There's got to be a way to go.
[160:45.78]It has to be a way.
[160:46.72]One of these is open, maybe?
[161:10.04]Oh, okay.
[161:10.42]I can go there.
[161:19.45]Glintblade Trio.
[161:21.15]First new spell of the game.
[161:27.35]An old sorcery of the Carrion royal family creates a sigil overhead from which three enemy-seeking glintblades appear after a brief delay.
[161:35.30]This can be used while in motion.
[161:37.94]Charging increases the delay.
[161:40.82]The prototypical form of sword phalanx, sorceries saw a different subsequent refinement in the realm of shadow.
[161:50.42]I'll try it.
[161:50.84]Cool.
[162:02.29]Oh!
[162:04.69]There is a treasure chest right here.
[162:14.46]Legendary?
[162:16.20]No.
[162:16.72]Wolfcrest Shield.
[162:21.91]Finally made blue shield featuring an engraving of a wolf under the moon excels at fending off sorceries.
[162:27.77]The wolf is the beast of the Carrion Royal Covenant.
[162:31.68]Symbol of the moon's pride that none can forget no matter what remote lands they may arrive in.
[162:40.54]This is a lot of magic defense.
[162:41.55]100% physical as well.
[162:45.35]This is kind of just all around a great shield.
[162:58.87]Alright, let me open up a shortcut right here.
[163:00.51]This is back to the beginning.
[163:17.11]Should I sit at the Grace?
[163:21.79]I shot this.
[163:22.19]This is the guy that I shot with 100 arrows.
[163:23.83]No, it's which one?
[163:24.70]It's this one.
[163:25.20]One of them.
[163:44.25]OK, let me get back to where I was.
[163:45.99]Yeah, did that.
[163:56.96]Here.
[163:59.66]Through here.
[164:03.42]And then.
[164:05.46]Down here.
[164:10.21]I have to survive.
[164:24.73]Oh dear, hold on.
[164:26.33]Yeah, we're wiping this all out right now.
[164:31.71]This is probably one of the hardest pulls in the DLC.
[164:36.62]Hey, we're going to wipe it out.
[164:38.26]I don't care.
[164:38.86]I used my entire mana bar.
[164:41.02]There was somebody in here called me a spammer earlier.
[164:43.84]I hope you saw that because you're right.
[164:51.17]I mean, I just used my entire mana bar and I have nothing left, but I hope there's not two of those.
[165:03.59]Look at me.
[165:03.99]What are you doing?
[165:04.81]I'm right here.
[165:06.85]Why does this guy not see me?
[165:17.27]What was that guy doing?
[165:38.24]I just wanted to give a bunch of people anxiety just real quick.
[165:54.27]OK, let's continue.
[166:21.96]Where is this?
[166:22.52]Okay, mark this on the map as like a thing.
[166:28.14]There's an item there and then there's one of these.
[166:32.30]Can't target it.
[166:33.48]I'm probably too high up.
[166:34.43]There's an item right there.
[166:35.25]I have to remember that.
[166:44.49]Yeah, no.
[166:49.30]Yeah, with pallbearer.
[166:50.60]Yeah, that was a fight or pallbearer?
[167:09.90]I could feel the wind from that spear on my ass.
[167:22.92]Both directions are bad.
[167:24.02]Both directions are bad.
[167:27.82]Invincibility frames.
[167:29.92]What?
[167:38.20]Hey, see ya.
[168:00.71]And there's the Grace right there.
[168:08.30]Yes.
[168:10.54]Thanks for the Jack Sparrow.
[168:26.63]Oh, when did I do a Jack Sparrow?
[168:42.90]Oh, yeah?
[168:43.82]Oh, yeah.
[168:44.54]Jack Sparrow.
[168:46.30]Bro was ba- You're talking about an impression- an impression from five years ago?
[168:51.26]What's with you guys lately?
[168:55.90]Thanks for the Jack Sparrow impression.
[168:57.50]You're talking about thanks for doing the impression five years ago and I saw the clip recently or something.
[169:05.59]What's going on here?
[169:18.02]Well, let's see what it is.
[169:20.12]Oh, this is Rellana, the Twin Moon Knight.
[169:33.31]Listen to the music, too.
[169:34.41]Holy shit.
[169:34.99]Alright.
[169:40.05]One, two.
[169:40.46]It staggers.
[169:41.14]Alright.
[169:46.40]Boom, boom.
[170:07.74]Good luck, dude.
[170:12.81]It was two years ago.
[170:17.97]It's longer than two years ago.
[170:23.04]Is it going to be the next five hours of the stream?
[170:28.73]Give me a minute.
[170:30.15]Give me a second.
[170:31.23]You don't know that.
[170:32.37]It could take 10 minutes.
[170:33.29]Alright, now that I know what's going on, let's do it.
[170:39.20]Here, I'll give this to you two.
[170:40.36]We're going to give you a temporary face cam.
[170:49.58]I'll give you guys a temporary face cam.
[170:54.87]You've been good.
[171:10.07]I don't want to say it, but my FPS is really bad in here.
[171:14.25]I just said it.
[171:14.79]Performance is really rough on this boss.
[171:31.93]Really?
[171:32.23]Is that half the fight?
[171:37.89]Is half this fight about fighting the performance?
[171:45.04]complainer alright no complaints for five straight minutes okay
[172:15.35]Cool moveset though.
[172:40.36]Okay.
[172:44.67]You look like Bill Lumberg.
[172:57.90]Later.
[172:59.94]What's happening?
[173:02.64]So, I'm gonna go ahead and need you to come in on Sunday.
[173:06.69]Gonna need you to come in on Saturday as well.
[173:09.21]Okay, right.
[173:11.03]Later.
[173:11.17]Later.
[173:30.00]I wonder if it's a fight we need to be aggressive, like really aggressive.
[173:50.25]Can I do Bubble Bath?
[173:51.03]I can do Bubble Bath, but it doesn't really hurt that much.
[174:06.63]So many different attack patterns.
[174:08.09]There's like eight.
[175:17.51]It's really hard.
[175:18.31]Okay.
[175:19.49]I think this is going to be much harder than the lion because
[175:25.76]the attack patterns feel very random and there's a lot of them so it's gonna and there's a lot of sword swinging so it's gonna be a lot of just kind of memorizing but it's hard to memorize when it's so all over the place I have no heels
[175:55.04]Change your weapon?
[175:58.46]Yeah, it's probably... Resisting magic?
[176:01.40]Yeah.
[176:02.23]Uh-oh.
[176:12.39]I only have magic attack stuff.
[176:14.77]Can we just go right from Moonvale, right off the bat?
[176:23.29]Okay, hold on.
[176:23.91]What are you doing for...
[176:33.62]I think it's a lot of slash damage.
[176:35.90]I think this is our... Maybe not this.
[176:42.96]I'm probably thinking just put on a ton of defense.
[176:47.21]Keep the stamina.
[176:48.23]Keep the physical damage boost.
[176:50.47]And we'll just go Moon Veil.
[176:52.31]See how this works?
[177:06.95]Jesus.
[177:11.89]Oh my god.
[177:21.92]Nice damage, dude.
[177:22.82]Did your mom get it for you?
[177:27.54]I'm a magic user.
[177:30.36]Well, not a magic user.
[177:31.72]I'm an incredibly intelligent weapon swinger.
[177:52.09]Call me stupid for using this.
[178:17.94]Yeah, dude, the 25 FPS is half this fight.
[178:49.26]Jesus uh this is gonna take like 200 attempts 588 damage a hit it's pretty good
[179:18.55]Is that bad?
[179:20.07]What?
[179:20.31]Oh, wait.
[179:20.89]You were saying that was bad.
[179:22.27]I thought you were like, oh, 588 hit, man.
[179:25.27]588.
[179:26.11]That's good.
[179:27.61]Like, that's pretty good.
[179:29.36]No, you were saying like 588 Omega Lull.
[179:31.58]That's what you did.
[179:32.22]You didn't put the Omega Lull.
[179:40.45]Okay.
[179:41.85]You can't just... You gotta...
[179:51.51]It's not a whole lot of telegraphing either.
[180:04.22]We're not getting very many like... Up, up, up, go.
[181:16.17]Walk into it.
[181:40.73]What the fuck is that move?
[181:41.89]You're gonna jump over the second one.
[181:54.26]I have no stamina.
[182:22.61]And guess what, guys?
[182:24.41]I saw the trailer.
[182:27.51]I know there's another phase.
[182:29.15]This is going to get way worse.
[182:32.91]I already saw the trailer.
[182:34.05]Is someone a mimic tier?
[182:43.30]I mean, we can pull out Bombo.
[182:48.08]Not at this moment.
[182:50.42]Your camera's being weird.
[182:51.56]Yeah, it's alright.
[182:53.49]I'll fix it later.
[183:21.28]In what direction?
[183:22.42]What direction are you even swinging your sword?
[183:26.90]It's just like, she's going this way, and then she's going that way, and then going that way, and then that way again.
[183:36.53]Oh, by the way, this happens over the course of nine and a half seconds.
[183:45.61]You're going to be summoning Tish in a few hours.
[183:47.17]I'm going to be summoning Tish in ten minutes.
[183:49.12]Thank you.
[183:56.20]There's very little openings.
[183:57.98]I almost want to do this.
[183:59.72]And this is going to be crazy.
[184:02.20]But.
[184:05.47]Watch how crazy I'm about to get.
[184:11.03]What if I just like.
[184:13.69]Just build up Scarlet Rotten Runaway.
[184:15.61]Or bleed or something.
[184:25.41]Look at this.
[184:27.19]Let's try this.
[184:29.86]Watch out.
[184:30.38]Oh, he's crazy now.
[184:35.32]Any weaknesses or anything?
[184:36.50]We'll find out.
[184:37.08]Alright.
[184:51.54]Rot, rot, rot, rot, rot, rot.
[184:53.06]Rot is on.
[185:01.03]Why did I take off the other weapon?
[185:08.98]I took the other weapon off.
[185:11.26]Hold on.
[185:11.68]Time out.
[185:12.06]Give me a second, please.
[185:15.32]Thank you.
[185:15.66]Appreciate it.
[185:16.36]Okay.
[185:16.96]And time in.
[185:44.36]Okay, that rot is still ticking.
[185:47.02]What a brilliant video game scientist I am.
[186:09.99]It's still ticking.
[186:12.58]That's the play.
[186:13.48]That's the play every time, no matter what.
[186:30.11]Whoa, it's not a jump.
[186:31.65]It's another dodge.
[186:37.03]Give me my stinger.
[187:06.88]And what's the name of that weapon?
[187:09.40]Sting.
[187:26.14]And now... Rot!
[188:19.63]Rocks are not doing any damage.
[188:21.43]Just testing stuff.
[188:25.92]What about poison?
[188:28.38]Okay, I'm just going to dual wield poison, rot, bleed.
[188:32.12]I'm going through the entire Wizard of Oz of all the damage types.
[188:35.80]Do I have poison?
[188:40.01]I'm going to just have four daggers like General Grievous.
[188:45.59]This is blood.
[188:46.31]It's arcane though.
[188:53.78]moon veil is technically bleed but I feel like I want to be like stab stab stab stab stab if I can get the bleed with moonville I could do it alright so we're gonna do yeah let's do that this needs to be held in uh I don't have enough strength for it
[189:11.69]on one hand.
[189:12.05]What do you mean, Wizard of Oz?
[189:14.15]I mean that there are four damage types in the game.
[189:17.49]Well, not damage types, but kind of afflictions.
[189:20.28]We've got Rot, Poison, Death Blight, and... I don't know.
[189:32.59]Let's look at the other one.
[189:46.36]Put this in the other hand.
[189:52.64]Let's do it.
[190:13.59]OZ damage types, water, rust, flying, and house.
[190:23.12]What the heck?
[190:25.40]I'm stuck in my, hold on, on my chairs.
[190:35.48]That doesn't count as a death and you can't count that as an attempt.
[190:39.84]Got it.
[190:45.90]Yeah, I'm going to put a bunch of rot juice, a bunch of poison, a bunch of frost, a bunch of holy, a bunch of death light, a bunch of fire into the same pot, and I'm going to throw it at her.
[191:02.36]I'm just going to throw acid.
[191:14.05]And I think it's just aggressive.
[191:38.79]I didn't put the rod on.
[192:41.26]Swing!
[192:41.82]What the fuck happened?
[192:44.12]I just pressed the button four times and it didn't swing.
[193:07.97]Ah, there we go!
[193:09.13]Show me the trailer!
[193:33.80]Man.
[193:40.95]I'm actually completely fine.
[193:42.33]I'm not, that's not happening.
[193:51.05]I'm getting closer.
[193:54.50]I do like this strategy, but I just did it wrong.
[194:00.33]I got to apply the rot first.
[194:02.29]And then it's all about just bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed.
[194:16.98]Oh, I drank a... Just kill me.
[194:18.96]I drank a mana potion.
[194:27.25]I mean, this is going to be a huge pain in the ass, but I think I should be able to do it.
[194:31.04]But I would love to see the other moves in Phase 2.
[194:33.76]Why are you wearing the same outfit as the boss?
[194:43.32]Am I?
[194:45.99]For one second, I thought you were talking about me.
[194:51.63]A grey t-shirt and that's it.
[194:53.67]This boss has more than a grey t-shirt on.
[194:58.74]I kind of am dressed like the boss.
[195:08.83]I think it's just patience that's really it and I just don't have any.
[195:27.22]It's so hard to tell how many swings are going to happen.
[195:37.17]You almost kind of have to eat some damage just to get a few hits in.
[195:58.00]How do you still?
[195:58.56]There we go.
[196:20.91]God.
[196:25.49]It's like the only opportunity to attack is if you stand across the whole room to the back wall and throw rocks.
[196:34.28]And then when she's coming out, you just run to the opposite wall and do the same thing.
[196:41.62]Seven hits to rock.
[196:43.04]Actually really good to know.
[196:48.09]I'm going to give it two or three more tries before I try to change a little strategy here.
[197:04.10]I feel like such a little dick.
[197:18.85]You can dance around all you want, but if I get you with this rot stick, it's over.
[197:32.96]I feel so bad for people that are just pure, like, quality build against this boss.
[197:41.54]If you're just playing, like, a 40 strength, 40 dex, or, like, 50 dex, 50 strength, you are so fucked here.
[197:50.22]Like, you just... I don't even know what you do here.
[197:54.06]If you have longsword equipped in your right hand, you're gonna... You got a lot to look forward to here.
[198:26.84]I know how to handle people like this.
[198:31.86]Same technique we're going to use.
[198:33.04]The same technique we used for Gonzo.
[198:37.24]Onzi.
[198:37.78]Onzo.
[198:38.10]Whatever his name is.
[198:54.79]We're going parry.
[199:00.99]What's the
[199:01.65]Best parry shield.
[199:07.64]Do I not have it?
[199:08.62]Isn't it just leather shield?
[199:12.32]Good luck with that.
[199:14.62]Any shield is a parry.
[199:16.24]Buckler.
[199:16.62]I don't think I have it.
[199:21.32]I mean, this is the rift shield.
[199:28.91]Do I even have the buckler?
[199:41.42]I think this is this.
[199:43.30]No, this is definitely the same animation as the buckler.
[199:45.98]It's the same frames.
[199:47.94]OK, we're going rot parry and I'm going to tear my hair out in about five minutes.
[200:03.43]Hey.
[200:08.61]What was that?
[200:12.77]That was dumb.
[200:19.28]I think the game bugged out because it was like when I did the parry.
[200:24.51]I'm going parries and when you see me get the parry, you guys are gonna freak out.
[200:33.62]And then I'm just doing rot.
[200:59.73]What?
[201:00.53]Wait, what the fuck is going on?
[201:05.23]Can you not parry?
[201:06.87]You parry, but it doesn't give you a critical?
[201:08.72]Are you serious?
[201:11.46]You have to parry twice in a row for the crit.
[201:17.16]Oh, they really did not want anybody to beat this boss.
[201:20.55]Okay.
[201:24.86]These are DS3 style half parries.
[201:34.00]Okay.
[201:34.66]Well, I did not realize that was happening.
[201:37.45]Try a couple of... You know.
[201:52.67]I like my other strategy a little better.
[202:04.90]Swatting flies over here.
[202:33.53]Let's go!
[202:38.01]By the way, this weapon's not even- it's plus zero.
[202:46.40]Door's stuck.
[202:50.71]I- I got to phase two doing the- the rot- the rot coward build.
[203:01.18]I think we're going full rot.
[203:03.28]Rot coward.
[203:07.12]Where's that shield that I just got?
[203:08.44]How much strength does it need?
[203:09.28]12?
[203:09.70]What do I have?
[203:10.52]Okay, I need one point in strength and I can be rot coward.
[203:24.83]Yeah, let... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[203:27.13]Let's do... Let's do this.
[203:31.84]I've got some... I feel like I was doing okay with this.
[203:35.30]Wasn't bad.
[203:41.08]I also could use summon.
[203:41.98]That's true.
[203:43.32]I might ring the bell here.
[203:45.12]No, not yet.
[203:47.55]Not yet.
[203:48.33]Not yet.
[204:02.55]I did not mean to press that.
[204:03.77]Actually, it was kind of good.
[204:22.46]Those timings are so... I'm not sure I'm ever going to get those timings.
[204:46.11]Alright, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[205:14.51]Stamina.
[205:22.87]Jesus!
[205:23.41]I gotta put the jumping attack talisman on too.
[205:57.03]Jesus.
[205:57.85]Damn it.
[206:08.81]Oh, it's just my brain has so much trouble with it.
[206:11.73]There's just so many attacks in a row.
[206:12.94]It's like Pontiff.
[206:14.38]It's like Pontiff Sullivan, but Pontiff Sullivan sometimes just does like one or two swings.
[206:19.12]I feel like every time it's just like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[206:38.40]Fuck you.
[206:38.84]I don't give a fuck.
[206:42.93]Get her, Mamba.
[206:46.45]How do you fare?
[206:55.27]Oh no!
[206:55.71]Oh no!
[207:09.16]Is this luxury pontiff?
[207:10.76]No.
[207:15.99]Oh, what?
[207:17.09]I wonder what happened at the end of that episode.
[207:18.59]Maybe we'll find out next week.
[207:32.15]Hmm.
[207:54.76]testing if I could run instead of dodge, run around them, but you can't.
[207:58.28]Boom.
[208:31.89]Dammit.
[209:38.21]I'm just running
[210:02.60]I love how, like, my attack is... It doesn't matter how fast your weapon is, you kind of can just go... And just run.
[210:11.43]Run!
[210:29.38]Is this Heart of the Millenia?
[210:54.05]That's hard to answer considering... Okay, so Malenia had a shitload of telegraphing.
[210:59.93]This is more like Pontiff and Malenia combined into one.
[211:06.94]Like, Malenia did like a, Here comes Waterfowl, get ready!
[211:10.62]It's like you could kind of prepare... There's not a whole lot of preparation here.
[211:16.69]It's a lot of just fighting, just swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing.
[211:21.54]It's like, I feel like this is a player-controlled character.
[211:24.38]It's like a gigantic NPC invasion.
[212:08.18]I can't even hurt this boss.
[212:18.63]It feels like PvP against somebody that's way better than you.
[212:21.25]It feels like you're playing against... Okay, there's like 10 people controlling this one character.
[212:27.22]One person has a button for each button.
[212:29.60]Although that would be terrible.
[212:30.82]It would be really easy to beat that person.
[212:34.18]What's your skidoo tree fragment level?
[212:36.06]It is.
[212:36.76]A three.
[212:42.86]It should be enough.
[212:43.70]It should be fine.
[212:47.63]Alright, we're going.
[212:48.37]We're not doing.
[212:48.81]We're not doing anything fancy.
[212:55.25]Make peace with this one.
[213:01.83]Alright.
[213:02.27]I'm going to treat this like I'm going to treat this.
[213:04.25]I'm going to treat it like it's a player.
[213:44.41]Thank you.
[214:21.45]Thank you.
[214:54.47]Thank you.
[215:55.63]Why does this boss have a million health?
[216:04.61]Dude, I... I feel like I just fought the boss for like as long as it takes to beat... Um... I was gonna say Radagon.
[216:15.45]Ragnaros in World of Warcraft.
[216:23.90]Alright, let's go.
[216:24.60]This is a player.
[216:26.18]And I can't lose because people will make fun of me.
[216:28.00]It's like, oh my god, dude, you suck.
[216:29.66]You're terrible at PvP.
[216:30.78]Yeah?
[216:31.57]Yeah?
[216:42.66]Thank you.
[217:19.40]I'm sorry.
[217:55.98]Thank you.
[218:37.31]Hey!
[218:46.56]How do you get knocked and hit by the second one?
[218:50.21]Hey, wait for me.
[219:30.44]Alright, this fight is insane, but is it alright?
[219:49.69]I'm going to run out of mana.
[219:55.55]That was pretty good.
[219:57.23]That was a pretty good attempt.
[220:01.96]I got to be... What about that new talisman that I just got?
[220:13.12]I kind of want to try it.
[220:21.93]I wonder if this sucks.
[220:24.73]No, it needs to be so much faster than that.
[220:29.37]I'm curious how bad this is.
[220:30.47]Of course he dodged it.
[220:40.44]I just want to see how much damage it does.
[220:50.36]It's good, but not worth holding it.
[220:52.43]You have to hold it for too long.
[221:01.47]Yeah, 755 versus... I think it was 8 something.
[221:07.29]I mean, it's like 10%.
[221:14.46]Yeah, she's way too fast for it.
[221:19.75]I was kind of doing alright.
[221:23.51]I think getting a boss's health down to the last like 20 to 30% means with a summon, you got it.
[221:31.38]Let's see if I can make it happen though without the summon.
[221:35.92]I'm willing to grind it for a little bit.
[221:38.60]I'm having fun.
[221:49.71]Bad start.
[221:55.62]Damn.
[222:11.11]Yeah, the ultimate problem with this boss is there's no way to tell how many swings are going to happen.
[222:20.11]It's just kind of like, she's just coming in.
[222:22.98]She's just going to fuck your ass up.
[222:26.58]That's it.
[222:28.90]Okay, again, this is a player and you're going to make fun of me if I get beat in PvP.
[222:33.68]Okay, so if I hit tab right now and you see my kill-death ratio in my Elden Ring PvP stream...
[222:42.01]then people be like, holy shit, man, this guy's like bad at PvP.
[222:44.79]No, I'm not.
[222:45.49]Watch.
[223:24.89]What did Miyazaki say?
[223:26.69]We're gonna try to test the player like we've never tested them ever before?
[223:34.10]Well, this is boss two.
[223:37.70]I don't know how many there are.
[223:41.16]He did not say that.
[223:45.00]No, you understand, in an interview he said, we're going to test the player like they've never been tested before.
[223:50.26]We're going to test the limits of players.
[223:54.42]And if you can beat Rolana, Twin Moon Knight, wow, you must be an ultimate gamer.
[224:12.93]It was a direct quote.
[224:42.61]What the fuck are you talking about?
[224:43.83]I just did the back dodge!
[224:53.67]Worse than Millenia?
[224:54.77]No, not really.
[224:57.54]I don't think so.
[225:01.80]I don't think so.
[225:10.07]I mean, I wish I was at 60 FPS, but I don't know if that's my computer or the game or a combination of both, but I'm sure that's maybe 10 to 20% of my problem.
[225:20.19]But no, we're not going to use that as an excuse.
[225:22.01]I play Bloodborne, and it's my favorite game of all time, so we're not going to use that as an excuse.
[225:41.19]See what I mean?
[225:41.63]It's just like, god damn, there's so many attacks in there.
[225:54.11]Not a whole lot of opportunity.
[225:55.43]With Malenia, there's a lot of opportunity to attack.
[225:58.32]And Malenia gets staggered.
[226:00.98]So, I don't know.
[226:02.06]No, I wouldn't say so.
[226:03.14]Not yet.
[227:00.37]Alright, here we go.
[227:01.47]Do I run?
[227:06.49]Fuck.
[227:06.95]I thought it was... Wait!
[227:07.61]She didn't do the other thing!
[227:25.23]Damn it!
[227:25.65]No!
[227:25.97]No!
[227:28.23]Oh my god!
[227:32.25]Oh my God.
[227:33.27]What do you do?
[227:44.98]What do you do?
[227:48.90]Okay, even if you dodge, it's like dodge, dodge, dodge.
[227:54.48]But on the second or third dodge, okay.
[227:57.46]And all these FromSoftware games, if a character attacks like 10 times in a row, your dodge roll, your animation ends and you'll get hit by something.
[228:10.35]What is the opportunity to fight?
[228:11.77]I don't get it.
[228:36.23]You beat Millenia, dude?
[228:38.65]I summoned like eight people from Millenia.
[228:47.21]It's not complicated.
[228:48.07]Dodge the attacks.
[228:50.23]You're looking for a growl and wear over that now.
[228:53.33]I don't do growls anymore.
[228:55.37]Sorry, guys.
[228:55.87]I'm going to use this early.
[229:15.12]Damn it.
[229:49.51]Shit!
[229:50.11]I tried to... God damn it.
[230:14.89]I'm figuring it out.
[230:16.75]I'm understanding something.
[230:18.45]It just clicked.
[230:37.19]It clicked.
[230:37.85]It clicked.
[230:38.31]It just clicked right now.
[230:39.59]I get it.
[230:44.00]There is no opportunity, so you have to just don't attack until she's completely done.
[230:48.60]Completely.
[231:06.49]This is so fucked up.
[231:15.00]So she's going to do like 11 swings in a row sometimes.
[231:18.64]So just, just don't do anything until she goes like this.
[231:22.99]Swing, swing.
[231:24.67]Let go, then attack and then run.
[231:27.05]There's like a one second opportunity after like a full combo is done.
[231:31.00]And that's the only time you should be attacking.
[231:38.60]Like not right there.
[232:11.49]So,
[232:58.95]Out of mana, shit.
[233:00.07]Already?
[233:00.49]Not the time to attack.
[233:39.60]Oh, shit.
[233:40.18]I got caught up.
[233:44.22]Oh, my God.
[233:45.28]I got... My hands are just like water.
[233:51.73]It's 25 FPS in here.
[233:52.81]My hands are water.
[233:53.55]I don't understand.
[233:54.33]She swings too many times.
[233:55.21]Alright, we're getting close.
[233:56.09]We're getting close to anger.
[233:57.95]We're getting close.
[233:59.01]We're not there yet, but we're getting close.
[234:05.45]But you figured it out.
[234:06.65]Yeah, I did figure it out.
[234:13.55]No, no meltdowns.
[234:14.81]I'm doing just fine.
[234:17.21]If I wasn't making any progress, I would be very upset right now, but I think I am.
[234:24.27]Alright, it's like daytime, so it just... That was actually like 14 frames a second.
[234:32.71]Can I only fight her when it's like 7 o'clock at night?
[234:39.52]I actually, it was like I was playing... I don't even know.
[234:45.55]Use a weapon that scales with INT.
[234:50.75]It does.
[234:54.10]This is probably the best thing I could use right now.
[234:58.75]Stop streaming, it's taking up too much RAM.
[235:20.37]Dude, no!
[235:20.89]Turn the fucking sun off!
[235:42.04]There's more?
[235:45.07]Get out of here with that shit.
[235:47.09]There's more swings?
[235:50.71]That's absolute baloney.
[235:51.69]Oh, he just threw up.
[236:06.97]I used that joke way too much.
[236:10.15]It's the last time I'm ever going to do that joke.
[236:15.01]Oh, he's going to puke.
[236:16.75]I'm never doing that ever again.
[236:34.91]Yeah, you can't attack there.
[236:36.81]He's gonna dodge it.
[236:37.51]God damn.
[236:58.34]I'm alright.
[237:25.58]Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[237:27.60]Gonna do the thing.
[237:58.52]What the fuck is that?
[238:17.67]so
[239:26.09]What the fuck are you supposed to do here?
[239:51.76]You can't fight this boss.
[239:54.48]You cannot fight this boss.
[239:57.35]It's an animation showcase.
[240:00.73]It's an animation showreel.
[240:02.97]You can't fight this boss.
[240:06.95]This boss is not fightable.
[240:07.97]It's an animation showcase.
[240:09.49]It's like, whoa, that's a lot of awesome looking animations.
[240:11.74]I wish you would stop doing them.
[240:20.82]I think there was a 20 to 30 second period there where I was just watching this character do moves in a row.
[240:31.41]I mean, it was beautiful.
[240:32.97]What a gorgeous showcase of all the animations.
[240:38.64]What did I get?
[240:39.46]What, 30%?
[240:40.60]20%?
[240:40.62]I don't even know what percentage that was.
[240:43.12]I couldn't even go into attack.
[240:44.42]It was like fucking walking into an earthquake.
[240:49.82]You can't fight an earthquake.
[240:52.24]It's like the dude's out punching fucking waves.
[240:55.30]It's like, dude, it's the ocean.
[240:56.42]You're not going to hurt it.
[241:04.57]Because this phase is like, alright, I get it.
[241:06.61]Okay, but what the fuck, man?
[241:15.49]I'm ringing the bell in phase two.
[241:18.67]We can watch the animations with all the boys.
[242:19.20]Thank you.
[242:53.36]Dude, good luck to all the no-hit speedrunners and stuff.
[242:57.86]Oh my goodness, I feel so much for you.
[243:00.66]This is going to be hell on Earth.
[243:25.70]Do something!
[243:28.68]Wait, what if I just stand still?
[243:30.14]Is that the whole thing?
[243:30.82]It's like, if you don't swing at her, and you stand still and you bow, then she bows and then it's over.
[243:55.20]I think you just suck at the game.
[243:56.52]That's so funny.
[244:01.63]It's so fucking funny.
[244:03.91]Because, like... It's just the quickest way to get somebody to be like, what are you talking about?
[244:12.35]Especially when you know that the first is, like, 40 attempts in.
[244:15.82]Like, hey dude, I just don't think this game's for you.
[244:19.30]Oh.
[244:20.58]I know what you're doing.
[244:22.26]I know what you're doing, and guess what?
[244:24.32]I've played the game before this.
[244:26.56]I know not to take the bait.
[244:36.46]Dude, even, okay, even one swing with the katana is too slow.
[244:46.05]One swing with the katana is too slow.
[244:51.26]Like, she gets to do all this shit and I just go... Like... I get the bastard stars and I just go... Dude, maybe I need to use one of the DLC weapons where you fly around and fucking jump around and throw your arms in every direction like she is.
[245:23.61]Use the horse?
[245:24.21]Dude, you can't use the horse.
[245:28.29]I just accidentally summoned the boys.
[245:29.94]Oh, these guys are so bad.
[245:38.98]But they're our friends, so we don't care.
[245:42.36]We don't tell them that.
[245:44.49]We want to encourage these boys to do some work.
[245:48.51]But that guy almost fell over three times trying to attack her.
[245:50.91]I'm just saying.
[245:57.73]We all have to swing like this, guys.
[246:00.39]We all have this problem.
[246:02.19]Not just me.
[246:04.29]Look at how long it takes this guy.
[246:05.36]Look at this guy.
[246:05.78]Look at this guy.
[246:07.20]He can't swing faster than that.
[246:13.68]We all don't get to swing as fast as this character does.
[246:15.94]It's so unfair.
[246:20.87]That actually did a shitload of damage.
[246:23.41]That did an unbelievable amount of damage.
[246:25.95]Tatra with the torch.
[246:28.25]Oh, no.
[246:28.81]Oh, too bad.
[246:43.39]Alright, simply stand back.
[246:47.63]Alright, now get her.
[246:55.81]I can't.
[246:56.23]Alright, well, they did actually kind of good.
[247:08.65]I got to reset it.
[247:12.27]I got to reset it.
[247:24.78]Do a real laptop gamer mode?
[247:29.23]At least she isn't healing every swing.
[247:30.91]That's why I'm not... I can't say it's worse than Millenia, because I mean... Okay, you can't make a statement like that, because in, like, six more hours into the DLC, they might be... I'm not... Honestly, I wouldn't even be surprised at this point.
[247:43.62]Like, we're in Elden Ring.
[247:44.68]This is, like, FromSoftware's sixth or seventh game in this kind of genre.
[247:48.95]And they have tons of hard stuff, tons of amazing level design and boss design.
[247:52.69]I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a boss, you walked in the door, and it was just a spinning, rotating machine gun of arrows...
[247:59.15]that just shot a thousand rounds a second in every direction.
[248:02.92]And it never stopped.
[248:04.22]And it had 10 million health.
[248:06.34]I wouldn't be surprised.
[248:36.27]I'm bringing out the Mambo.
[248:38.17]It's time.
[248:39.81]It's time.
[248:40.13]Let's see how it goes.
[248:40.61]Let's see how Mambo does.
[248:46.42]Alright.
[248:46.76]Come on, Mambo.
[248:55.30]actually pretty unbelievable.
[248:58.04]Get it with that whip!
[249:01.46]I just want to watch those two fight.
[249:12.95]Hold on Mambo, be careful.
[249:22.64]If I can have like five blasts for phase two, I'll be happy about it.
[249:26.28]Shit.
[249:31.33]All that fire is so good.
[249:39.17]Mambo's the best summon in the game.
[249:40.52]I don't care what anybody says.
[249:41.34]Holy shit, Mambo is kicking the absolute shit out of her.
[250:00.95]Alright, let's go.
[250:08.12]I don't... Dude, go forward, backwards?
[250:10.66]This 2 come out so quickly.
[250:11.92]I just don't... I don't know it yet.
[250:13.16]I haven't figured it out.
[250:13.76]Okay.
[250:27.01]what the that was a weird scream that was like let's hydrate jump over it is that what you're supposed to do
[250:54.29]We're getting there.
[250:55.97]Yeah, I mean, with a summon.
[251:00.70]I'll be able to do it.
[251:01.30]I'm just trying to challenge myself for a little while.
[251:05.66]I'm going to try to save it for phase two, though.
[251:07.98]I'm curious if I can get there.
[251:09.64]I can.
[251:09.96]What am I talking about?
[251:10.50]I got there like 15 times already.
[251:29.76]I'm always so afraid of a follow-up.
[251:48.01]Like that, see?
[251:48.67]It's like, when are you gonna do that follow-up swing?
[251:50.73]There's two or three follow-ups that happen.
[252:12.93]There's more!
[252:13.73]What the fuck?! !
[252:17.29]It sucks so bad because it looks like she's stopping her animation.
[252:21.32]She'll go like, one, two, one, two.
[252:23.90]Oh, here's another one.
[252:26.24]It's like, come on, man.
[252:43.89]You got a cliff bar?
[252:45.32]No!
[252:46.31]I don't want any cliff bars.
[253:31.99]Thought I could get it again.
[253:32.79]Just run!
[253:59.25]Yeah, right when I think I can figure out the timings, it's just... She'll just do a hundred other moves in a row.
[254:07.27]Too random.
[254:08.31]It's too random.
[254:09.30]I don't like it.
[254:09.84]I still... Look how much damage I have not done.
[255:01.19]Fucking god.
[255:08.20]Did you eat the fragments?
[255:09.26]Yeah.
[255:12.22]Come on.
[255:12.68]This is a PvP fight.
[255:13.74]You got it.
[255:15.50]I'm very sweaty.
[255:16.29]Yeah, I'm incredibly sweaty right now.
[255:20.34]You should stand up for this.
[255:22.00]Yeah, because you want me to stand up because I have just underwear on.
[255:24.54]No, I'm not going to fall for that.
[255:25.54]I almost did.
[255:25.94]I almost just stood up and it was like, no, what the fuck?
[255:29.84]Don't do that.
[255:31.49]It was a joke.
[255:32.99]I just like looked, I like couldn't focus on the camera and I like went cross-eyed.
[255:36.13]Because I have glasses on.
[256:13.76]Dude, her weapons turn into Looney Tunes characters and get longer!
[256:19.27]What the fuck?!
[256:25.70]I've seen that shit in a cartoon before!
[256:27.26]Not in a fucking video game!
[256:28.92]Video game is a cartoon.
[256:30.30]Effectively.
[256:31.00]It's a cartoon.
[256:32.20]Is this a cartoon?
[256:34.71]Is a video game a cartoon, guys?
[256:54.24]This is so fucking annoying.
[257:26.31]I forgot my buttons.
[257:38.05]Let me just do it again, because I'm going to drink.
[258:06.73]she also does this thing where sometimes she just like hops forward without moving it's just like how do you even know when the she's gonna do that she just like goes she just moves forward with a swing and she's like goes 20 feet forward
[258:56.72]Do you watch compilations of yourself in your free time?
[259:03.16]Yes
[259:05.02]I sit there.
[259:05.50]I lean back.
[259:06.84]I look how my stomach is out.
[259:08.72]I watch videos from like fucking 2014.
[259:12.68]I just sit there with a cigar and I just like... Those were the good days.
[259:20.25]Hey, remember when I said that?
[259:24.27]It was pretty funny, wasn't it?
[259:27.07]Hey, watch this.
[259:29.67]I call this guy a shpee.
[259:30.79]It's hilarious.
[259:33.28]It's hilarious.
[259:44.04]Thank you.
[260:15.81]so so
[261:04.44]What the?
[261:04.78]Why would I swing again?
[261:05.62]What happened?
[261:06.20]Why did I press the button twice?
[261:07.52]I didn't do that.
[261:09.11]It was a ghost.
[261:18.77]We'll be right back.
[262:12.23]Combo!
[262:13.61]Need your help!
[262:20.13]She's over there, Bombo.
[262:26.94]Oh, I'm getting too cocky.
[262:28.72]Alright, here she goes.
[262:30.24]Here she goes.
[262:30.52]Go, go, go, go, go.
[262:31.10]Come on.
[262:31.46]Alright, be careful, Bombo.
[262:40.21]This is it.
[262:40.59]This is it.
[262:41.05]This is for all the marbles.
[262:53.83]What's going on?
[263:00.29]What's happening?
[263:04.93]I ate every fucking bullet.
[263:15.48]All the skin of my mouth is falling off.
[263:38.27]What the hell, man?
[263:40.77]What the hell?
[263:41.41]Just saying.
[263:57.63]You give me, like... You give me 60 FPS.
[264:02.62]You give me a...
[264:06.58]Fresh air.
[264:07.00]60 FPS.
[264:09.64]Mint.
[264:14.40]And I would do it.
[264:34.81]My ass is sticking to the bottom of the chair.
[264:37.51]If I stood up right now, it would make a sound.
[264:38.89]Alright, I gotta get up.
[264:42.34]I'll be right back.
[264:47.40]Stretch time.
[264:50.02]Get up and move.
[264:52.14]Move around.
[264:52.86]Stretch.
[264:53.40]Get a drink.
[264:54.85]I'll be right back.
[269:32.82]Hello.
[269:34.41]Sorry, I scared you.
[269:37.03]Maybe I didn't.
[269:39.05]Okay.
[269:40.11]As I was peeing, I was thinking of a strategy.
[269:42.55]I was strategizing in the bathroom.
[269:51.66]Holly was like, hey, what's going on?
[269:53.16]Everything alright?
[269:54.62]Apparently, all she was hearing was
[269:58.70]fucking game and nah that's I was like I'm good and every time I would scream fuck my pee would stop so it'd be like I I did not do this alright everybody settle down
[270:29.96]Alright, here's the deal.
[270:35.72]This is what we're doing.
[270:37.16]First of all, I'm going to fix the webcam.
[270:40.20]Otherwise, people are going to be very upset with me, which, you know, I agree.
[270:46.16]Very frame-ready.
[270:47.08]Let me fix it.
[270:47.58]Is that better?
[270:59.13]There it is.
[271:02.65]you know when you press apply on something and then you have to do it every single time you ever open the webcam software what does apply mean does it mean apply for an hour no dude we're not streamers
[271:34.98]Okay.
[271:36.38]Here's my new plan.
[271:39.62]Plan is... I'm gonna kick the shit out of him.
[271:50.92]Ding ding!
[271:52.06]Here we go!
[272:22.35]Help me!
[272:29.10]Just barely out of reach.
[272:52.71]I need mana.
[273:06.59]No!
[273:12.71]Get away from me.
[273:22.06]She just baited that out big time.
[273:26.96]Alright, this is the one right here.
[273:28.64]Bombos has tons of health.
[273:30.06]She hasn't even attacked him once.
[273:47.43]Holy fucking moly, dude.
[274:23.63]Thank God for the fucking flask.
[274:25.47]How many times have I said that?
[274:36.76]Holy shit, man.
[274:37.98]There's so much fucking variable dog shit in this fight.
[275:00.51]Okay.
[275:01.81]I'm going to spam ice crystals at her in the head.
[275:11.87]I'm going to just laser beam her in the head over.
[275:16.76]I'm going to watch this.
[275:18.50]You want to see how we're going to do this?
[275:33.66]We're gonna Ronnie Moon this shit.
[275:36.98]Ice storms.
[275:37.80]I'm talking ice mist.
[275:39.26]I'm just gonna be obnoxious.
[275:49.96]You're gonna magic attack a magic-resistant boss?
[275:52.87]Well, it's better than me using my magical weapon to magically attack the magic-resistant boss.
[275:57.49]I have a... Dude, my whole character...
[276:00.20]My whole character is 68 intelligence.
[276:05.07]I have to use magic.
[276:14.35]This is your punishment for going sorceries.
[276:20.43]Deal with it.
[276:23.00]So strong with your sorceries.
[276:24.38]Not against this boss.
[276:27.12]Time for the hard wall, streamer.
[276:32.11]Oh yeah?
[276:36.95]See me in here.
[276:58.29]Face the power of ice!
[277:05.46]Do what you were born to do.
[277:07.44]Spam spells at every boss.
[277:12.46]Do what you were born to do.
[277:33.51]Face the wrath of the Shamoa Ice Storm!
[277:39.13]Holy shit!
[277:40.11]This thing actually is fucking crazy!
[277:51.32]Oh my god!
[277:52.56]I'm actually kind of annihilating her.
[278:03.37]Please don't tell me that me doing like a fucking meme run is gonna beat this.
[278:35.02]so
[279:27.56]No!
[279:31.21]Face the wrath of the Zamora Ice Storm.
[279:37.83]Okay, so that was just a stupid joke run, but Zamora Ice Storm is actually amazing.
[279:50.27]Is this a randomizer?
[279:51.27]Why is he wearing this?
[279:55.98]A randomizer?
[280:00.34]Why is he wearing this?
[280:07.58]I chose to wear it.
[280:10.14]And I repeated what you said three times just to make sure I was aware of it.
[280:14.87]I chose...
[280:23.94]Yeah, it's pretty whack.
[280:27.51]Alright, I'm running up there and there's more ice storming like nine times in a row.
[280:38.15]I will win this with just absolute ice chaos.
[280:45.26]I also need to put the witch hat on.
[280:53.02]We're only doing one move.
[280:54.52]Why would I have anything else on?
[280:55.42]I'm gonna actually laugh if this works.
[281:10.51]Talismans?
[281:11.57]Oh yeah, you're right.
[281:14.93]That's okay, I'm just fucking around.
[281:29.25]Mambo, I love you, but I think you're actually making the FPS lower.
[281:50.34]How did this work last time?
[281:52.20]I have no idea what the fuck happened last time to get this to actually do it.
[282:16.54]That does hurt Mambo?
[282:17.86]No.
[282:24.71]That's so sad and funny that I've been dancing around dodging every attack and freaking out trying to just do some more ice storm and fucking run in a circle like a dickhead.
[282:34.82]This is how far I got her in like 10 minutes of fighting her straight.
[282:43.54]I'm kind of screwed now though So
[283:11.75]How much does this do?
[283:13.79]That's not bad.
[283:14.63]I like forgot.
[283:22.21]Okay.
[283:22.58]I honestly just wanted to see how much damage it did.
[283:24.44]And I forgot that the other character was playing too.
[283:37.59]Play for the frost build up.
[283:38.53]Yeah.
[283:41.38]Yeah, actually, I think that the I think the Mambo is resetting the frost damage.
[283:48.18]This is interesting.
[283:49.28]OK, let's I'm going to actually go for this one here.
[283:51.28]Let's do talismans.
[283:56.96]This has just been on the whole time and I have what the fuck am I doing?
[284:10.03]Actually, no, let's do the cast time.
[284:15.60]How is the Ice Storm now?
[284:29.15]Use Yoda?
[284:30.61]Oh, yeah.
[284:30.83]I was going to level up Yoda.
[284:33.19]Honestly, I think the...
[284:35.41]I think the... You know what?
[284:36.27]We're going to do this too.
[284:37.45]Let's just go all in.
[284:39.23]I'm just being an absolute wacko.
[284:41.37]Watch this.
[284:43.03]It's going to build up eventually because I'm going to hit her a few times, right?
[284:46.14]Do some more Ice Storm.
[284:47.44]Load up the Rot.
[284:51.02]I think this is going to be alright.
[284:57.35]If this character is my wall right now... Hold on.
[285:03.05]I can't.
[285:03.63]We'll talk later.
[285:25.95]Okay, you still have to dodge the attacks, man.
[285:27.96]Come on.
[285:28.16]What the fuck are you doing?
[285:41.01]It's kind of hard to see what I'm doing when that ice storm is going.
[286:04.31]Braum's still not on?
[286:18.00]How is Rot still on a fight?
[286:24.52]There we go.
[286:25.04]Okay, Rot's on.
[286:50.94]I don't know what's happening, but I think we're winning, Mambo.
[286:56.30]That was such a fucking, like, mar- I'm so- I- Why did I do, like, a Marvel movie quip?
[287:05.61]Just play.
[287:07.09]Hey, I don't know.
[287:07.59]I don't know what's happening, but it sure sounds like we're winning.
[287:10.02]It's like, okay, then I just crashed.
[287:22.25]This is going to work and it's just absolute dog shit.
[287:29.16]Yeah, we did the dog.
[287:30.22]Okay, I did the dodging.
[287:31.82]I got I got her down to like 20% with just like no summons, just like swinging the katana.
[287:37.47]We'll go an absolute dog shit mode and I think it's actually going to work and I'm looking forward to it.
[287:43.79]We'll go an absolute dog shit mode.
[287:45.85]I like saying that word, don't I?
[288:03.55]wrong flask come on bombo
[288:33.14]Rot is on?
[288:33.76]Nope.
[288:42.01]Rot is on.
[288:58.76]Fire and ice together.
[289:43.46]Run away!
[289:43.96]Alright, Zamora Ice Storm has got to go away now.
[289:52.58]No way I'm going to be able to do it.
[290:19.82]Thank you.
[291:00.56]Fire damage is resetting the Frostbite?
[291:02.14]Yeah.
[291:03.96]Okay, new plan.
[291:05.36]So, Marai Storm is cool, but I feel like I'm just kind of... I'm just memeing a little too much with it.
[291:15.09]The Rot is a good idea.
[291:19.73]Honestly, maybe it's this.
[291:30.60]Yeah, Mambo is resetting the Frostbite.
[291:40.18]It's all about dog shit mode.
[291:46.49]Darkmoon just does the debuff.
[291:50.55]Okay, Darkmoon and then Zamora Ice Storm like three times.
[292:05.78]Alright, get in here.
[292:14.06]There's so much shit on the screen.
[292:21.88]No, not close enough.
[292:23.08]That's horseshit.
[292:23.88]Alright, I have to restart.
[292:28.24]Yeah, that whole thing.
[292:29.44]She was like one foot out of the fucking circle all the time.
[292:48.67]Two moons, maybe?
[292:51.13]Actually, two moons is probably a good thing to start because I can do it right off the bat and then drink immediately.
[292:54.77]Alright, we'll try that.
[292:56.97]Yeah, whatever.
[292:57.83]I'm going in.
[292:58.57]Let's go.
[292:58.99]Who cares?
[293:35.85]Here we go!
[294:17.52]Get off!
[294:17.84]What the fuck are you doing?
[294:19.00]It's a fight!
[294:35.54]That's a wrong flask!
[294:39.35]What's going on?
[294:39.91]What did I do?
[294:42.93]What the fuck is that move?
[294:44.23]I don't want to do that.
[294:50.35]I'm driving a fucking car.
[294:56.81]Just run away.
[294:57.85]Just run away.
[294:58.23]The rot will kill her.
[294:58.91]The rot will kill her.
[295:03.68]No, the rot's off.
[295:24.57]We're here with the top 10 lamest ways that a streamer beat Rellana.
[295:31.02]Number two, we have German95 running in fucking circles.
[295:47.50]Is the rod off?
[295:48.56]It is.
[295:48.84]I'm running out of stamina.
[296:32.71]The fucking turn I had to just do.
[296:46.72]I'm over.
[296:47.98]Hmm.
[296:58.70]Okay.
[297:20.54]You could have beat her if you actually shot.
[297:22.08]I don't know.
[297:24.78]I don't think I even had enough mana.
[297:27.00]Alright, here's a couple things too.
[297:29.60]Okay.
[297:30.54]That was not... That actually was kind of working.
[297:35.84]I was kind of into that.
[298:16.53]You just fucked everything up!
[298:54.92]Sorry.
[298:55.22]Dude, the thing was coming down!
[299:08.21]I didn't apply the rot at all.
[299:39.82]Oh my fucking goodness.
[299:56.49]That delay sucks absolute balls.
[300:23.12]Few more levels maybe?
[300:27.98]Next five tries, I think.
[300:31.30]I think you're right.
[300:33.34]And I think it's just moon spam.
[300:39.52]I think I'm just... I'm just gonna... I'm gonna close my eyes and just shoot moons.
[300:47.97]Okay, I gotta get the rod on.
[300:49.27]That's right.
[300:49.65]Yep.
[300:50.21]Rod's really important.
[300:53.45]Running in quick.
[301:01.24]Here we go.
[301:12.58]She's on me.
[301:16.79]We need the stagger here.
[301:19.05]There it is.
[301:19.73]No, that was Bombo.
[301:43.37]The wrong fucking flask again.
[301:45.05]That just may have fucked everything up.
[302:01.87]It's on, it's on, it's on.
[302:02.51]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[302:23.69]That move is fucking unbearable.
[302:53.23]I dodged that.
[302:54.47]What are you talking about?
[302:55.47]I'm dead.
[302:59.93]I don't have enough heals.
[303:02.91]Do I not have enough rot slop whatever the fucking essence thing is in this game?
[303:08.79]Am I missing like two rot slops to be able to fucking actually hurt this motherfucker?
[303:15.73]I don't know what it's called.
[303:33.49]Maybe you should upgrade the Roth Dagger.
[303:46.18]I'm talking about these things.
[303:59.36]sorry uh skidoo tree blessings not rot slop I don't know where I got that from I was close I know but alright I think we're just gonna here's what we're gonna do I have a new tactic
[304:25.15]We're going to summon this knight and we're summoning the boys and I'm just going to kill it.
[304:35.49]She's very resistant to all of my damage and I'm just going to summon the entire fucking city to fight this.
[304:42.07]Alright, everybody, let's do it.
[304:50.89]I'm going in for real this time.
[305:01.59]I don't know who to attack.
[305:03.73]It's confusing.
[305:13.40]Oh, hey, I wonder how's Jerma doing on that boss?
[305:15.82]Oh, he's got six summons.
[305:17.80]Oh, it must be rough.
[305:34.71]Everybody get in here.
[305:38.63]You're not going to be able to kill us all.
[305:40.11]I got news for you.
[305:40.89]Everybody get in.
[305:47.60]Oops.
[305:47.86]I think I just did that to one of the boys.
[305:49.04]This is so stupid.
[306:09.16]Don't hit me, hit them.
[306:15.42]Oh no, they're still alive.
[306:16.38]They're still alive.
[306:33.04]Somebody do something.
[306:38.33]Good, nice hit.
[306:41.65]Nice one, James!
[306:45.97]Hey, remember that reference I did?
[307:07.52]Why is this taking fucking longer?
[307:12.85]There's seven of us in the room!
[307:18.17]There are seven of us.
[307:27.46]Who's winning?
[307:39.43]Everybody get ready.
[307:40.54]Oh wait, I got one single boy left.
[307:43.72]No, never mind.
[308:06.62]Thank you.
[308:45.06]Come on, that took forever to fucking drink.
[308:46.74]I'm dead.
[308:52.56]I feel like I'm doing the amount of damage I'm supposed to be doing.
[308:57.87]I'm supposed to be doing at least half times damage than I'm doing right now.
[309:08.91]I feel like I've unleashed every ounce of pain and I, I get her to like 40% health.
[309:16.36]It's rot slop.
[309:27.43]Oh, the summon raised her HP.
[309:31.68]Ah, okay.
[309:33.32]I think it's Mambo will bust, honestly.
[309:35.12]Or I go get some more of those Rot Slot... Whatever they're called.
[309:40.50]And I come back.
[309:46.27]Upgrade the Rot Dagger?
[309:50.85]Good idea.
[309:51.63]This fight is fucked up.
[309:57.90]Mambo plus NPC summon plus Rot Slop will work.
[310:11.91]I'm having so much... Is this the most trouble I've had with a boss, like, in FromSoftware history?
[310:18.16]It's pretty close.
[310:18.76]I... I mean, Malenia was... Malenia was alright.
[310:25.56]Alright.
[310:26.84]Maybe I'm misremembering how much I, like, hated Mileena.
[310:28.82]I don't even hate this.
[310:29.96]It's just, like, I kind of accepted that this fight is absolutely ridiculous.
[310:34.04]Like, just absolutely ridiculous.
[310:36.08]At least for this character.
[310:37.48]I can't even hurt her.
[310:38.12]Alright.
[310:40.14]We're going to go with Rot Sloth.
[310:48.20]Would this really even help me, though?
[310:50.42]I don't have very much.
[310:50.94]Maybe I should respec.
[310:51.63]What do you guys think?
[310:55.60]What do you think?
[310:56.60]Go down to like 50 int?
[310:57.84]40 dex?
[311:05.90]50-40?
[311:14.33]Bleed could be good.
[311:16.53]It increases raw buildup if you upgrade it.
[311:18.27]Does it actually?
[311:22.03]No, it doesn't.
[311:22.53]I think it just stays the same, doesn't it?
[311:25.91]Alright, let me break some stuff.
[311:27.85]Oh, man.
[311:28.65]This is tough.
[311:30.10]This is rough.
[311:34.46]You barely use your magic.
[311:35.56]Use more melee.
[311:38.56]Yeah, it's true.
[311:40.24]Let's go for it.
[311:50.28]I feel like a pure int character is very, very difficult against that fight.
[311:56.15]She's very resistant to magic, I would imagine.
[311:59.56]And getting up in melee is not something that I can really do very well.
[312:05.80]So, we're going to respec.
[312:08.50]We're going to respec into deck.
[312:10.00]I still want to stay int, though.
[312:10.94]I like int.
[312:12.14]We'll do a little bit more decks than int.
[312:14.61]Okay.
[312:24.64]The only thing the boss is weak to is lightning.
[312:26.36]Interesting.
[312:27.82]You're at 53 attempts.
[312:29.70]Holy shit.
[312:31.82]How many attempts did it take me to do the lion?
[312:34.54]And I didn't even use a summon for the lion.
[312:36.24]Oh, no, I did.
[312:36.68]I used Mambo once.
[312:37.36]Yeah.
[312:38.30]How many attempts did the lion?
[312:39.20]Like 10?
[312:39.78]15?
[312:40.10]Okay.
[312:50.66]Malenia took you 80 attempts.
[312:54.27]20 or 30.
[312:54.37]Line was like 20.
[312:57.75]You're at 127 deaths total.
[312:59.09]Alright, well, let's go for it.
[313:04.47]How high should I get this?
[313:16.65]Not all the way, probably, right?
[313:19.63]It doesn't affect the passive, but it'll at least hurt.
[313:25.21]Hit it to plus nine.
[313:33.13]Damn, this thing's actually kind of amazing.
[313:34.65]Okay.
[313:44.78]Let's go respec first.
[313:45.64]Let's get that out of the way.
[313:48.74]Oh, I also wanted to upgrade the... Where is it?
[313:53.62]There you are.
[313:55.60]I said I wasn't going to do plus 10, so I mean it.
[313:58.12]So let's do it.
[314:05.79]I want to see that cool guy in action.
[314:09.39]I need way more souls, though.
[314:15.25]Do you have armpit patches on your shirt?
[314:17.53]Um, no, I'm, I'm sweating through it.
[314:20.07]It is 110 degrees in Vegas right now.
[314:23.03]And I'm playing against one of the hard bosses in the FromSoftware presents Elden Ring downloadable content.
[314:29.61]Let's play episode two.
[314:52.05]I need a bunch of souls real quick.
[314:53.35]Hold on.
[314:55.43]Give me a minute.
[315:09.69]Dude, it's insane how I come.
[315:11.77]Look at how look at how buttery this is.
[315:17.10]It's so buttery smooth.
[315:23.12]Oh, this is what I want to play like.
[315:27.60]This is like 120 FPS right here.
[315:28.42]Okay.
[315:28.54]Well, let's just...
[316:05.91]I think it actually hurts now.
[316:14.65]Have you used the Elden Beast Remembrance?
[316:17.37]I have not, but I don't want to break it.
[316:19.01]Uh-oh.
[316:34.18]Do this one or two more times.
[316:49.54]I was reading chat, sorry.
[317:20.65]Did he beat the boss?
[317:27.74]No.
[317:30.42]I tried everything.
[317:31.16]I went in there with the whole cookbook and every friend I've ever met in my life and we still couldn't beat her.
[317:46.43]Probably good enough.
[318:09.56]Wrong person.
[318:12.02]I see.
[318:22.19]We have a plus 10 Yoda.
[318:30.25]I'm willing to spend one of my great glove warts on it.
[318:33.41]Okay.
[318:38.25]Sorry, boys, but for now, I'm going to take you off the bar.
[318:41.41]And I know that's sad to be removed from the bar.
[318:45.03]But...
[318:46.79]You're not forgotten.
[318:48.35]You will be back.
[318:52.01]But I want to see this guy in action.
[319:05.06]Okay.
[319:06.94]Now it's time to re-spec.
[319:10.08]50 int.
[319:14.11]50 dex.
[319:19.04]What do you think?
[319:19.84]What should the split be?
[319:21.46]50-50 is crazy.
[319:38.20]Yeah.
[319:39.62]Why not?
[319:40.06]Let's fucking go.
[319:47.98]I got tons- I got shitload of points left.
[320:06.01]What do you think?
[320:12.37]Do, uh, get Vigor to 60?
[320:15.47]That's kind of the map, but mind is... I kind of need mind, don't I?
[320:19.39]I need the summons.
[320:23.54]This is a horrible build, somebody just said.
[320:29.28]I can't use the moon now, but that's okay.
[320:38.68]You'll be fine with this mind.
[320:49.25]How much is it to summon the expensive ones?
[320:54.13]I need 129 FP.
[320:54.69]Yeah, hold on.
[320:58.75]That's a good question.
[321:03.55]What is... How much does it take to do it?
[321:09.27]Okay, I need 100... Holy shit, that's like the entire mana bar.
[321:13.60]Okay, well...
[321:25.46]So I need at least 22 mind.
[321:26.58]Okay.
[321:43.72]I feel like I'm okay with the endurance, where it is.
[321:57.55]60, 40?
[321:57.59]Dex int?
[322:04.59]Put every single point in intelligence.
[322:11.68]Do 40, 60?
[322:12.52]40, 60.
[322:12.64]Your staff requires 60 int.
[322:16.46]Well... I'm gonna have to put it into the, uh... Put endurance to 25.
[322:23.83]I'll do 28.
[322:30.92]29 Endurance.
[322:32.80]60 Vigor.
[322:34.74]22 Mind.
[322:35.14]29 Endurance.
[322:37.82]60 Dexterity.
[322:38.96]40 Intelligence.
[322:45.75]Do 40 Dex, 60 Int.
[322:53.39]But, but I like the, I like magic.
[322:55.57]Okay.
[323:01.36]You're only gaining 90 HP?
[323:06.70]Okay, I'm gonna do it.
[323:08.04]60 dex.
[323:11.52]You can come back to magic.
[323:12.83]Int is magic, I know, but... I'm sad that I'm not gonna be able to do the moon anymore.
[323:24.53]Is going from 27 to 40 dex really that big of a deal?
[323:26.91]I feel like I have to do this.
[323:28.84]Like, I really feel like this should be 60-40 this way.
[323:34.88]Am I crazy?
[323:45.49]Deck soft cap.
[323:47.54]Yeah, that's right.
[323:51.74]No, it's true, because then I can't use the staff at all.
[323:53.70]Alright, I'm going to do this.
[323:54.98]I'm going to do 60, 40 and 40 decks.
[323:58.76]I think this is good.
[323:59.39]I have more health.
[324:00.73]I got like seven larval tears or something.
[324:02.81]I'll be fine.
[324:05.70]Now I gotta think about what I'm gonna use for a weapon.
[324:11.14]Why do I need decks?
[324:13.57]Because I want to be doing more damage.
[324:16.69]And I'm not casting as many spells as I could be.
[324:21.05]I need more mind.
[324:22.67]I'm gonna go with... I actually agree with that.
[324:25.23]I really do.
[324:26.89]And I know that people are gonna be upset about that, but I can... I'll just level up.
[324:31.22]We're locking it in.
[324:35.12]I need more mana.
[324:36.44]I have like weapon arts and stuff that I use.
[324:38.26]I can still use this.
[324:46.01]Alright, now we're going to figure out talismans.
[324:59.68]That's fine.
[325:08.74]I could put the Int Talisman on and get back to 65.
[325:12.94]I could also just farm runes to complete the build.
[325:16.28]That's not a problem either.
[325:21.91]You have rune arcs as well.
[325:33.85]Hmm.
[326:20.46]Poisoning or rot in vicinity increases attack power.
[326:23.64]Wouldn't that be kind of cool?
[326:25.48]If I get the rod on and then I just start just absolutely slashing.
[326:29.52]I kind of want some bleed too.
[326:35.54]Okay, there's rot in the vicinity.
[326:51.88]I kind of want to put this on because after she dies, there's more chance for epics and legendaries that come out.
[327:00.12]What each boss drops, like, usually like five or six items.
[327:07.53]So it'd be good to probably have a little bit more like higher chance of legendaries.
[327:14.99]That's probably good.
[327:15.89]Yeah.
[327:18.29]And then after that, I'm going to vendor my entire inventory without even looking at it and pick up the same unique 15 times and then uninstall the game.
[327:29.16]That sounds like a good idea, right?
[327:49.33]What about for the gear?
[327:50.73]Because I'm not using this anymore.
[327:54.48]Although, I could wear that and be able to do it.
[327:59.04]We're not going for moons anymore.
[328:00.48]I'm going for rot and quickness and maybe a little bit of bleed or something.
[328:05.22]I don't know.
[328:07.27]I wish arcane would increase the rot.
[328:10.61]Or just dex.
[328:11.45]What's a good int dex weapon that I have right now?
[328:14.07]I think the bug wing will do a lot more now, right?
[328:27.04]This is doing a lot more.
[328:28.70]Although I think the dagger might be kind of fun.
[328:34.88]Oh, that's right.
[328:35.28]The moon veil would be pretty good too.
[328:40.46]I didn't put one point in strength.
[328:43.31]It's okay.
[328:44.03]But yeah, this is kind of disgusting now.
[328:49.16]I think this is the way it's going to be.
[328:53.21]And we just got to try to get the bleed.
[328:56.97]And also just the rot tick.
[329:08.19]Rot slop.
[329:09.23]This is the worst build ever.
[329:12.47]Yeah, it's alright though.
[329:16.57]Guys, my build is going to change the second that this character dies, and I get the INT weapon that she absolutely has as a remembrance.
[329:24.32]Guaranteed.
[329:25.52]So... And we have Yoda now.
[329:29.40]Keep that in mind.
[329:38.13]I want something else on the helmet, though.
[329:41.25]No, that's fine.
[329:41.99]This is alright.
[329:43.45]Alright, let's go for it again.
[329:46.38]And this time, we have what we need.
[329:53.45]Where is he?
[329:58.25]Need a strength talisman.
[330:00.31]I just want one-handed.
[330:04.31]I could put on... What's the strength?
[330:08.25]Dog.
[330:08.61]What's a dog face, right?
[330:12.77]I don't have it.
[330:19.30]Anything else increase like strength by one point?
[330:29.39]I don't want to put this thing on.
[330:45.60]okay here we go let's go for it I don't I know I'm summoning every single thing I have I'm rot build and then we're gonna move on and then me strong will beat this off stream for this giant club let's see how good uh yoda is
[331:15.75]Alright, come on, Yosh.
[331:49.20]Ah, my flasks.
[331:54.05]Dude, Yoda is awesome.
[332:11.28]Sometimes I just feel like I need to preload like eight quarters into the arcade cabinet so I can just press the fucking top button, the top red button to come back in.
[332:19.56]A red wizard is about to die.
[332:26.00]Red wizard is dead.
[332:28.96]A green warrior is now it.
[332:31.66]A red wizard is now it.
[332:34.79]Blue wizard is now it.
[332:55.59]What just came out of my mouth?
[332:56.57]Did I just burp?
[333:18.92]Oh, Mumbo, I need you.
[334:01.72]Thank you!
[334:36.22]Oh, piece of fucking dog shit.
[334:38.56]If I had too many fucking mana flasks anyways.
[334:46.95]Do a rune arc.
[334:49.01]I actually don't think I want the other summon, but... You know what?
[334:58.94]I do have rune arcs.
[334:59.84]Let's do that.
[335:06.60]become all powerful.
[335:19.25]Flasks?
[335:19.63]Yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[335:21.69]I'm gonna go with two.
[335:23.77]Three mana flasks.
[335:34.66]Wait.
[335:39.29]oh shit oops wait I can do the thing where you can I can just I can just uh kick her out right and just rest where is it okay sends another home right
[336:12.12]I'll see you in one minute.
[336:22.77]I think I'm okay with that.
[336:23.71]I feel like I'm going to need it.
[336:38.20]Did I not?
[336:38.68]Oh, I need to rest.
[336:39.26]Wait, what?
[337:22.90]You were looking the other way too.
[337:24.14]That's bullshit.
[337:32.83]Let's not fight her in the corner.
[337:34.03]That'd be great.
[337:56.72]Alright, it's on.
[338:10.08]Alright, go drink an Estus.
[338:30.31]She's throwing it in random fucking directions!
[338:59.07]Fuck you!
[339:08.81]I thought it was just like somehow not correct.
[339:15.40]I'm gonna get it.
[339:16.30]This fight sucks absolute fucking asshole.
[339:23.92]I'm gonna start crying.
[339:29.06]Alright, let's not summon yet.
[339:34.95]I'm gonna redo.
[339:35.35]We lost the rune arc too, which sucks.
[339:37.73]Yeah, just reset it.
[339:44.93]Mambo instead of Yoda?
[339:46.07]Yeah.
[339:49.88]The thing on your head has a negative side effect.
[339:59.77]Uh, this is the worst.
[340:00.71]I feel like all the other bosses I'm not going to have this much trouble with.
[340:06.59]It's funny because like Pontiff Sullivan was a huge wall for me in my Dark Souls 3 playthrough.
[340:11.77]People that have two swords where one sword can go that way and the other sword just goes like that way.
[340:18.60]You have me fight a giant that like takes up the whole screen and spams like a thousand moves every... I'll be fine.
[340:28.48]He doesn't know.
[340:29.04]I'm going to kill Messmer first try.
[340:32.52]I'm going to glitch into the ceiling and just do a laser over and over again.
[340:36.60]I'm going to take 15 mana potions with me.
[340:49.85]What am I doing?
[340:50.45]Oh, right.
[340:51.07]Something's wrong with this.
[340:58.40]It is kind of killing my strength index, isn't it?
[341:04.08]No, no, no.
[341:04.38]Not strength index.
[341:05.00]What's it doing?
[341:07.58]My focus is lower?
[341:09.58]But I don't know.
[341:10.12]Who cares?
[341:10.52]It's alright.
[341:17.79]Alright.
[341:56.32]Oh, it's making my Estus flasks shit too!
[341:59.34]Oh boy, that's correct.
[342:10.83]Wait a minute.
[342:14.72]Why do I have 16 strength right now?
[342:17.74]What is giving me strength that I... What's giving me strength?
[342:27.35]Oh, the... Oh, I have... That's right.
[342:28.87]Godrick's rune arc is 5 to everything.
[342:30.47]Okay, well, there we go.
[342:31.29]I don't need the... I don't fucking need that thing.
[342:33.08]We're good.
[342:37.81]We're gonna wear the Helm of Solitude.
[342:39.63]No, we're gonna put on the Ser Gideon off-air helmet.
[342:42.25]This is the way that I should be.
[342:43.23]This is the way that I look.
[342:44.64]I'm gonna beat it right now.
[342:47.08]100% guaranteed.
[342:48.84]Are you ready?
[342:51.06]I'm doing literally everything.
[342:53.57]And it's Mambo, by the way, not Yoda.
[343:43.87]Is it on?
[343:44.87]How's the route not on?
[343:55.02]I can't see the screen, man.
[344:05.54]Why is the rot not on?
[344:07.38]Is it?
[344:07.78]I can't even fucking tell.
[344:08.76]It's not.
[344:14.25]I've hit her like 30 fucking times.
[344:19.27]My screen, I literally went to like 8 frames a second right there.
[344:31.54]Guys, what the fuck is going on right now?
[344:39.72]What?
[344:47.94]Why is the rot?
[344:49.18]Why are you not rotting?
[345:14.57]It's on finally!
[345:15.70]And I'm dead!
[345:19.88]You just saved my fucking life.
[345:22.18]Alright, you guys just fucking kill it.
[345:23.40]I don't even want to be here anymore.
[345:30.97]Why did that take so long?
[345:34.37]That took an unbelievably frustrating amount of time.
[345:36.94]What the fuck happened?
[345:55.46]I'm not going to do it.
[345:56.94]I have enough.
[346:21.54]Okay, I hit her 100 times with the Rotknife, and it didn't work.
[346:29.02]High, high resistance.
[346:30.83]Each player an NPC.
[346:31.83]It's the NPC summons.
[346:36.33]I hit her five times.
[346:37.21]Okay, so we gotta do it with just Mambo.
[346:44.05]It's impossible that you died.
[346:45.07]This character is unbearable.
[346:50.57]And I'm going to start screaming real soon.
[346:54.41]Just watch.
[347:25.79]Nice move!
[348:00.29]There we go.
[348:01.13]Holy fucking shit.
[348:02.09]That was so dumb.
[348:06.57]Hold on, guys.
[348:07.11]I have to... Just quiet.
[348:08.91]I'm going to complain about the game, but you know what I'm going to... Shut up.
[348:51.11]Oh shit, I forgot!
[349:28.37]Boys and girls.
[349:30.35]That is how.
[349:31.14]I feel like my eyes are like bright fucking red.
[349:45.86]That was fucking horrible.
[349:50.41]But hey, uh.
[349:54.45]What I mean?
[349:54.97]People were talking about the guns yesterday.
[349:57.82]I did, uh... I think I did 25% of that damage.
[350:04.95]Yoda did a lot more.
[350:06.31]But it was a team effort.
[350:07.49]I was cheering him on.
[350:08.67]I was screaming in the background.
[350:10.81]Let me... For all of you playing the game... Look, hold on.
[350:13.56]Listen to me.
[350:13.88]Hear me out.
[350:15.28]Hear me out on this.
[350:15.74]Listen up.
[350:16.48]I want everybody to just... Relax for a second.
[350:17.78]Listen up to me.
[350:19.70]I'm going to show you an item that you have to put on if you're having trouble with this boss or trouble in general.
[350:25.69]This has saved my life so many times.
[350:28.47]It's like actually not even funny.
[350:30.59]It's not even funny how much this actually has helped.
[350:33.93]I need you to go and I need you to go get this.
[350:38.72]Where is it?
[350:43.18]I'd like for you to go get this.
[350:45.58]This thing has actually saved my life.
[350:49.38]God.
[350:50.84]A dozen times.
[350:52.16]When your health gets below 20%, this thing automatically heals you and it lasts for three minutes.
[351:06.09]Somebody just said that thing sucks.
[351:08.35]Replay the part of that fight where I was just about to die.
[351:12.45]If I didn't have this on, I would have died.
[351:17.41]That ends the lesson.
[351:22.05]That was fucking horrible.
[351:24.03]That was like the worst thing ever.
[351:26.01]No, it wasn't.
[351:26.59]It wasn't that bad.
[351:28.47]I didn't even get mad.
[351:32.93]I actually didn't even get mad.
[351:34.67]I'm like fine right now.
[351:35.85]I feel like good.
[351:36.55]I felt great.
[351:37.61]I know I was not.
[351:38.37]I was fine.
[351:40.19]I was fine.
[351:45.80]You just panicked.
[351:46.52]Yeah, I was.
[351:46.98]I was getting a little stressed and panicked, but I wasn't angry.
[351:49.94]I was having a great time.
[351:54.28]I'm not taking advice from you.
[352:00.04]It definitely was not Millenia level.
[352:06.64]No, I'm having fun.
[352:09.99]Okay, there's a few things that I don't like about that boss.
[352:12.33]I don't like how you attack.
[352:14.11]I don't like all your attacks.
[352:17.93]And now... I won.
[352:29.08]I just accidentally hit my head.
[352:31.06]Ooh.
[352:31.88]Wait, is there anything else in here?
[352:33.50]Skadoo Altus.
[352:40.53]Yeah, boss weapon.
[352:58.22]Dude, I think this... I think it's demons.
[353:04.57]I think it's demons took over this world.
[353:08.69]And then the Golden Order has to come and get... I think that's what it is.
[353:13.53]I think it's demons and angels.
[353:23.60]No, Golden Order is bad.
[353:25.75]Golden Order are tech... I think they're bad.
[353:29.80]I think they're the bad guys of the game.
[353:37.24]Damn.
[354:07.01]Wondering about the horn scent, are you?
[354:09.27]True enough?
[354:11.12]...in any other circumstance, he'd be at our throats.
[354:14.08]Long ago... ...Queen Marika commanded Ser Messmer to purge the Tower Folk... ...a cleansing by fire.
[354:21.22]It's no wonder the Horned Saint holds the Ur-Treen contempt.
[354:24.60]That aside... ...man is, by nature, a creature of conquest... ...and in this regard, the Tower Folk are no different.
[354:32.96]They were never saints... ...they just happened to be on the losing side of a war... ...but it's still a wretched shame.
[354:42.16]Okay.
[354:42.36]Okay.
[354:42.64]Interesting.
[354:43.08]He's so into the lore he wants to hear it twice.
[354:46.54]You have to do dialogue in FromSoftware games.
[354:50.25]You have to try to talk to them like five times.
[355:11.09]Wait, I abandon here my heart.
[355:15.45]That's different than the other ones.
[355:26.06]Crazy.
[355:32.94]That's a great desktop wallpaper.
[355:35.56]Those of you that have a 4K screen or something, just put over three monitors.
[355:53.51]Why does your character have no drip?
[355:56.93]My character doesn't need to bend to your idea of a costume or a drip.
[356:06.38]This is what the character wears.
[356:08.40]Therefore, that is his power with no drip.
[356:14.54]All these people need to look so cool and so fashionable.
[356:18.05]He don't give a fuck.
[356:20.01]And that makes him strong.
[356:25.56]The shoes are from Walmart.
[356:27.30]You want to know.
[356:30.42]Monk's missive.
[356:32.60]May the best win.
[356:33.62]I got a couple of things that I needed to look at here.
[356:40.96]A letter bearing a tourist message and an illustration of a monk.
[356:45.73]His hands held together.
[356:47.47]Seek me to the east if you wish to pursue the way of the warrior.
[356:50.83]When you find me, you will challenge me to about.
[356:53.27]There is no need for words.
[356:57.55]OK.
[357:03.66]I want to I got this.
[357:04.70]I think like when they're like a note or something.
[357:08.21]Yeah, I got electro charge.
[357:10.99]That's a cool ability.
[357:15.54]This is it right here.
[357:17.06]Message left by Needle Knight Leda.
[357:19.15]Rest to kindred spirits who also pursue a Miquella.
[357:22.03]Time Miquella seeks the tower sealed by shadow and the gate of divinity found there.
[357:26.57]If we are to reach him, we must burn the tree that seals the path.
[357:29.79]And for that, we require a flame.
[357:33.77]A Frenzied Flame.
[357:40.76]Oh, cool.
[357:53.51]I think I'm just gonna get this over with.
[357:57.55]Alright, now this is the real question.
[358:01.06]This is the real question.
[358:15.05]What can I get from this?
[358:28.75]This is int and faith.
[358:32.11]And this is just double bubble.
[358:44.25]Overlapping twin moons would strike the ground one after the other, violently shaking the Earth with moonlight.
[358:50.94]In her childhood, she and her elder sister Rennala met these moons, overlapping as though nestled against one another.
[358:59.85]Rinala's sister?
[359:04.80]Two blue balls?
[359:10.99]I don't have enough int to do this, though.
[359:16.95]Duplicate the Remembrance?
[359:33.83]This is grip.
[359:38.01]But I could also get the Elden Lord armor.
[360:20.12]I think it's kinda cool.
[360:47.25]Oh, I thought this was a peg leg!
[360:52.68]No, it's like a chain.
[360:58.25]I thought it was like a pirate.
[361:07.49]This is like the weirdest superhero.
[361:20.43]Oh, yes.
[361:20.95]Just come a little closer so your dear old grandmother could see you better.
[361:27.63]What big eyes you have.
[361:28.97]Oh, yes, they're better to see you with.
[361:30.55]That's what I was trying to say in an incredibly roundabout way, my dear.
[361:34.79]Alright, what am I doing?
[361:46.20]What is the charge?
[361:53.16]I mean, do I just go respec again and just use those things?
[361:58.60]Just do faith int and just put them on?
[362:02.18]Or do I just go full total blue balls?
[362:19.97]Try them.
[362:22.21]Well, I could duplicate it if I wanted to.
[362:27.88]Make a poll.
[362:28.44]I know who wins the poll.
[362:31.00]It's the two blue balls.
[362:32.80]And this thing's going to be terrible.
[362:36.86]I need a DLC weapon.
[362:38.92]I don't know.
[362:39.44]The blue balls are going to be terrible.
[362:41.24]It's going to take like 15 seconds to cast.
[362:43.58]And it's going to take my entire mana bar.
[362:52.63]Why not both?
[362:54.95]I'll get them both.
[362:55.79]I'll get them both.
[362:57.51]Although, I can't even use this without 72 int.
[363:02.76]Swords are a unique weapon type.
[363:04.26]I mean, they look so cool.
[363:09.75]Just dupe the remembrance.
[363:10.85]Yeah, I can do that.
[363:12.30]I can just use... Okay, just remember... Let me remember this.
[363:17.00]If I use this right now, I can just... It doesn't matter.
[363:20.26]I don't need it in my inventory to get it remembered, right?
[363:22.70]Okay.
[363:28.63]I think I want these.
[363:34.89]I want to look wicked cool.
[363:49.75]I want this to be the only cool thing about this character.
[363:52.07]There they are.
[363:58.79]Cool.
[363:59.62]And I can keep the raw dagger, that's fine.
[364:02.52]It's still useful.
[364:05.22]It has C scaling on everything.
[364:08.52]So what, is this just like 30, 30, 30, 30?
[364:09.98]25, 25, 25, 25?
[364:10.50]In literally every single thing?
[364:24.61]Well.
[364:25.67]Hey, remember me?
[364:26.59]Yeah, I'm back, uhm.
[364:31.89]On the receipt it says.
[364:32.87]7 days.
[364:34.95]Uh, wasn't really a fan of my last thing I was doing.
[364:39.73]Could I get a refund please?
[364:41.71]By the way, your sister says hello.
[364:44.31]And she's dead.
[365:11.40]This is kind of wacky, isn't it?
[365:12.86]Is this a little wacky?
[365:32.20]This is a little too far.
[365:40.90]This is kind of shit.
[365:44.64]40, 40, 20, 20.
[365:45.00]Dex, int, and min the other two.
[366:06.62]Check the scaling on it first.
[366:08.12]Actually, yeah.
[366:09.30]No.
[366:11.62]I think it's seeing everything.
[366:18.45]Well, I mean, I could do this too.
[366:19.49]Alright.
[366:23.45]Hold on.
[366:23.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[366:24.59]Okay.
[366:24.91]How many people here?
[366:25.87]14, five.
[366:26.31]Okay.
[366:27.26]You got it.
[366:27.86]Okay.
[366:28.06]Listen, I'm going to guess what we're going to do.
[366:31.30]Watch.
[367:01.68]OK, so someone's going to come into the stream and like a few, probably, I don't know, like.
[367:08.68]OK, so I want everyone to be yelling at me that this is wrong.
[367:17.69]Ready?
[367:19.19]Three, two, one, go for it.
[367:26.53]I don't know what's wrong with it.
[367:28.69]That's, um, I want to have a bunch of health.
[367:32.38]Oh, shit, this joke doesn't work unless I actually confirm.
[367:34.60]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[367:37.18]I would, okay, this joke, everyone pause, pause, pause, pause.
[367:40.51]This only works if I confirm this and I have 95, this whole shit build and I'm sitting there arguing with you guys.
[367:45.67]Like, I just turned the stream on.
[367:47.31]And, like, I'm starting the DLC for the first time.
[367:53.92]Like, how did you play the game like this?
[367:58.87]Ah, that's kind of funny.
[368:00.09]Alright, let's do the real thing now.
[368:02.00]Because I don't want to waste a larval tier for a terrible joke.
[368:13.26]Yeah, actually, let me go confirm.
[368:16.44]Because let's level that thing up all the way.
[368:18.92]And check the actual scaling on it.
[368:20.78]Does anybody actually even really know the truth?
[368:35.91]It is actually unbelievable how much better the game runs outside of the DLC for me.
[368:41.15]Okay, it's all D. D. D. D. D. D. D. Okay, strength and dex both went to C.
[369:05.46]Alright.
[369:06.67]So it looks like it's strength decks into faith, right?
[369:09.69]2040, 2040.
[369:23.82]Is it all C?
[369:25.24]I mean, it's all C, but is that a higher C?
[369:29.06]I forget how the game's scaling works in a lot of these.
[369:32.70]Is it just C, or is it a high C?
[369:35.87]I think that's kind of how it works, right?
[369:42.09]There's a higher C. So deck slash int plus the base is
[369:52.11]Well, let's do it.
[369:54.21]Let's fucking rock and roll with this thing.
[369:56.87]I'm ready to go nuts.
[370:09.85]Can you put an Ash of War on this thing?
[370:11.37]I feel like it's a unique boss weapon.
[370:13.33]I don't think that you can do that.
[370:20.00]Yeah, you can't put an Astro Boar on most boss weapons.
[370:23.18]Alright.
[370:24.30]So it's time for all of chat to argue on what the perfect build is for this weapon.
[370:31.79]But you know what?
[370:33.93]Let's start everything at 20.
[370:35.05]And then let's have everybody fight for half an hour and see who wins.
[370:52.34]Okay.
[370:53.44]Start fighting.
[370:59.98]Alright, is any mods around?
[371:01.22]Or if no mods are around, I can do it.
[371:03.80]But can we get a poll?
[371:04.94]This is actually really funny to me.
[371:07.56]Do you want 30, 30, 30, 30?
[371:10.20]Do you want 40, 40, 20, 20?
[371:11.08]So 40 strength, 40 dex.
[371:14.50]So that's 40, 40, 20, 20.
[371:22.42]Or do you want 40-20-40-20?
[371:25.48]Or do you want 40-40-40-40?
[371:26.85]Or do you want 20-20-40-40?
[371:29.39]Only idiots do 40-40-40-40.
[371:51.47]It scales C on everything, so why would that be a problem?
[371:56.45]Now, explain to me in Elden Ring terminology why 40-40-40-40 is bad.
[372:04.29]Explain it to me.
[372:11.02]It only needs 13 strength?
[372:12.28]Yeah, but it scales C with strength, so it's getting the same damage upgrade on the scaling.
[372:19.71]You need int for the staff.
[372:21.35]Yeah, we don't care about the staff anymore.
[372:22.93]40 int... It's not the same.
[372:31.32]40... 40... Do 40, 20, 30, 20.
[372:32.28]You are just making numbers up.
[372:45.57]Strength and dex stack with each other as one damage type.
[372:48.65]So do 40, 20, 30, 20, 40.
[372:54.18]What?
[372:55.06]Make the poll strength.
[372:56.36]Okay.
[372:58.38]Poll number one.
[373:00.18]What should be at 40?
[373:03.38]Strength, dex, int, or faith.
[373:06.35]I actually like this.
[373:07.07]This is really funny.
[373:07.99]I love this.
[373:08.47]Alright.
[373:09.59]What should have 40 points in it?
[373:11.21]Strength, dex, int, or faith.
[373:24.18]He won't have enough FP for Yoda.
[373:26.74]Oh shit, I won't.
[373:29.90]So we gotta go 25, 30, 40, 20, 30, 40, 20.
[373:31.86]I just said, what is going on?
[373:41.59]Yeah, what should have 40?
[373:42.75]Strength, X, Int, Faith.
[373:43.85]That's a good poll.
[373:45.35]Actually, I could just do, I'm sitting right here.
[373:46.93]I could just do this poll.
[373:48.75]Why am I not doing the poll myself?
[373:54.49]Alright, what if I did 90 and then just get everything to minimum?
[373:59.63]And just hope that I can kill every boss in two swings.
[374:04.78]Alright, I'm doing a pull.
[374:05.88]Here we go.
[374:07.76]I need my keyboard.
[374:09.80]Okay.
[374:10.38]Slash pull.
[374:12.26]This is the part where I have the most fun in Elden Ring.
[374:17.65]Okay.
[374:17.75]Okay.
[374:21.12]Do what stat at 40?
[374:24.74]Because I feel like so many of you just disagree on everything.
[374:28.26]This is going to be wicked funny.
[374:30.44]Okay, strength, dex, faith, or int?
[374:38.93]You have two minutes to decide.
[374:44.85]I'm very curious.
[374:54.76]Somebody said, what are you, royalty?
[374:56.50]You don't know how to use a pole?
[374:58.00]Um, I was just... Okay, Dex is winning by a lot.
[375:11.35]Somebody said, anybody saying Dex is dumb, it's 41% of it.
[375:16.11]It's... Uh-oh, wait, Int is going a little higher.
[375:20.69]Okay, just put 99 points in Arcane and just complain at every boss that I'm not doing damage.
[375:24.78]And then you guys can... And that'll just say quit streaming forever.
[375:31.08]Okay.
[375:32.58]I am officially going to be putting 40 points in Dexterity.
[375:38.00]Good.
[375:39.59]I'm going to be putting a new poll up very soon here, okay?
[375:42.65]Everyone just relax.
[375:43.89]We're going to be doing another poll.
[375:47.39]This next poll is what else should have 40?
[375:51.49]Strength, Faith, Int?
[375:56.73]I guess it's Dex and Int should be 40.
[375:59.02]Because that's what's winning, right?
[376:01.38]And then it's... Yeah.
[376:06.34]Dex and Int will be 40.
[376:09.48]Because that's what's very close in second place.
[376:15.13]Okay, then...
[376:17.87]What should be... Should these be 25?
[376:20.03]The character's going to be so much worse.
[376:30.61]Okay.
[376:33.44]25.
[376:33.84]25.
[376:33.86]40.
[376:33.88]40.
[376:34.42]Dude, I don't have any... I can't summon any of my summons.
[376:43.50]Okay, there we go.
[376:49.16]How's this?
[376:54.39]Dude, I love democracy.
[376:55.61]You could have grinded 20 more levels in the time this has taken.
[376:59.71]Yeah, but that's not as fun as making chat get into a huge fight with each other.
[377:04.49]It's more fun that way.
[377:05.39]20 faith, 20 faith, 20 faith.
[377:17.28]Take Dex down and put it into Faith.
[377:19.53]Faith was the least voted on thing.
[377:24.01]Okay.
[377:24.69]New poll.
[377:25.53]No!
[377:25.95]We're just doing this.
[377:27.61]This is what we're doing.
[377:29.77]Congratulations, everybody.
[377:30.77]This is what we're doing.
[377:39.40]Faith isn't that good.
[377:42.20]So we're doing this.
[377:42.80]That's what you're saying.
[377:43.80]30, 40, 40, 20?
[377:52.92]Or... 60, 20, 40, 40, 20.
[378:05.22]I think this is complete.
[378:14.99]I have enough to summon the summon I like.
[378:18.41]The endurance I lose a little bit, but it's alright.
[378:19.71]I wasn't having a problem with it.
[378:23.10]Even less faith, really?
[378:24.54]I think this is fine.
[378:29.26]I'm going for it.
[378:42.91]That was a... I made that decision, by the way.
[378:48.05]That was my decision.
[379:08.85]Okay, now I'm happy.
[379:10.49]I'm completely happy this is getting locked in.
[379:20.71]Fifty-five.
[379:22.15]Fifty-five.
[379:22.93]Forty-two is weird, man.
[379:26.39]This is going to get to fifty eventually.
[379:27.87]Ah, thou art my son.
[379:39.00]Take a look at this shit.
[379:44.28]252 plus 142.
[379:45.12]161 plus 59.
[379:45.48]161.
[379:45.80]This thing is disgusting.
[379:47.92]Everybody that was complaining about this, watch.
[379:51.82]What is this guy wearing?
[380:00.00]Okay.
[380:03.00]Back.
[380:03.46]Okay.
[380:03.66]We got to test out the... We got to test it out.
[380:09.39]I'm excited.
[380:10.91]I'm gonna get up and stretch for a little bit too.
[380:13.68]Alright.
[380:14.20]I got it in one.
[380:14.78]I still have the raw dagger.
[380:15.78]Don't forget that.
[380:28.08]Cool.
[380:28.30]Alright.
[380:34.86]Don't forget I can go like that too.
[380:40.94]Dude, what the fuck was happening there?
[380:43.56]Alright, now we dual-weld it.
[380:57.58]I get a little... It's a little eccentric.
[381:04.01]I love it.
[381:08.97]look at the look excuse me oh it's that little that's a little excuse me okay alright okay
[381:52.74]I have a feeling this is going to be very good.
[382:03.95]Especially with the... I don't know.
[382:05.19]The fact that I'm kind of naked is... I don't know.
[382:08.23]This is like kind of... But wait.
[382:24.16]Oh, the Elden Lord.
[382:25.20]There he is.
[382:52.75]So look at look at how cool this is now.
[382:58.40]We need.
[382:58.86]A helmet.
[383:01.74]That's really cool.
[383:04.99]This is not it.
[383:07.07]It might be this.
[383:08.13]That's very possible.
[383:12.18]That's up there.
[383:12.78]That's really high up there for me.
[383:28.78]That's pretty cool.
[383:33.44]I'm not wearing a bug.
[383:36.68]I'm not wearing this either, although that's really funny.
[383:40.41]But does this have anything special on it?
[383:42.77]Oh brown pots.
[384:13.14]Close, but not quite.
[384:17.92]Close.
[384:19.04]This is really important, guys.
[384:27.98]There's so many different things I want to do.
[384:33.40]I don't hate that.
[384:34.89]I actually really don't hate that.
[384:39.77]I think it's this.
[384:40.69]I always think it's going to be this.
[384:43.54]Look at the attitude.
[384:45.26]Look at the attitude on that.
[385:02.80]That's got some serious attitude.
[385:03.96]Okay.
[385:09.08]What do I want to do now?
[385:11.04]Let me actually be able to do... Oh, I could kill maybe this, um, the dragon?
[385:14.82]Let me try killing the dragon.
[385:22.38]Slay.
[385:24.81]Somebody said slaying Sauron.
[385:40.29]I love it.
[385:41.89]Okay.
[385:43.17]We're going to go this way.
[385:45.15]Yeah.
[385:45.69]Maybe I won't be able to beat this, but we're going to go for it.
[385:57.73]Alright.
[386:07.59]I got to sit up.
[386:22.00]Whoa, that's a weapon.
[386:24.59]Great katana.
[386:50.50]Whoa!
[386:51.50]That's not a forward.
[386:52.80]That's a different attack.
[386:53.98]That's not like the other dragons.
[387:13.49]Uh-oh!
[387:13.81]That's a big stagger.
[387:30.08]Holy shit!
[387:47.05]Shit I need stamina
[388:00.65]Alright, just get away from it.
[388:01.63]That's all you do.
[388:10.14]I thought that should have hit.
[388:31.83]Stop jumping around!
[388:42.34]Uh oh.
[388:52.38]Oh shit!
[388:58.59]Maybe you just don't even get on the horse.
[389:24.05]uh-oh
[389:52.06]He's kind of rough.
[390:25.47]oh that's why I wonder if you can jump over it so
[390:57.86]I have a lot of mana flasks that I don't really need.
[391:33.09]Yeah, yeah, please lock onto the sheep that's over there.
[392:19.57]I thought he was... Okay.
[392:22.49]I don't need three mana potions anymore.
[392:23.81]Are you turning your lights on?
[392:31.65]I will in a minute.
[392:34.18]I get this.
[392:35.80]I have too many mana potions.
[392:38.30]And I didn't know that he did other dragon moves.
[392:39.62]I thought I was just another dragon.
[392:40.54]Alright, let's go.
[392:50.91]You're so scary right now.
[393:04.01]He's being a real gamer.
[394:01.40]No thanks.
[394:22.17]They had no stamina.
[394:23.75]Why am I draining so much of my stamina?
[394:55.01]Do something!
[395:19.86]I'm surprised I haven't got a stagger yet.
[396:19.38]Oh get away!
[397:13.74]That was so sick I jumped over it by hopping onto the fucking boat you know what I mean the horse
[397:32.79]This is a long-ass fight.
[397:59.46]Good.
[398:00.30]That's not what I wanted to do.
[399:10.94]Uh-oh.
[399:11.82]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!
[399:21.20]He's doing it again!
[400:19.21]I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.
[400:20.39]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[400:21.33]In the eye, in the eye, in the eye.
[400:22.41]Alright, now play safe.
[400:56.44]He's freaking me out.
[401:33.00]I am fucking around.
[401:35.49]Full health.
[402:04.29]Hey, dragon dead.
[402:12.23]Dragon heart.
[402:13.50]Oh, and this is where you get one of these cool.
[402:17.44]Are there new dragon powers?
[402:25.04]Doesn't look like it.
[402:31.08]Unless they're from a different dragon, maybe not.
[402:35.05]okay that was fun that was cool I am these weapons this weapon is amazing by the way I am very happy with this weapon it's really cool liking it so far oh right I'm like here please turn on the lights
[402:56.56]I actually kind of like it like this.
[402:59.02]Alright, I'm going to pee.
[403:00.36]I'm going to refill my drink one more time.
[403:02.28]And then I'm going to go do like a few more things and probably call it.
[403:05.43]I'll be right back.
[408:22.17]I'm back.
[408:30.86]Food mode activated.
[408:39.68]Just have an AI play.
[408:43.70]What the hell would an AI even do?
[408:57.77]Like, what would an AI-controlled Elden Ring character look like?
[409:02.37]I feel like that's how you'd get something goofy like, oh yeah, I decided to do 99 strength.
[409:11.19]And I'm only wearing shoes.
[409:20.36]Alright, I'm getting close to ending the stream.
[409:23.22]But there are a couple things I want to do.
[409:25.90]There's a few things I want to try to do.
[409:27.84]I'd like to go down here if I can.
[409:29.26]How have I still not gotten a map fragment?
[409:35.05]Alright.
[409:37.11]First of all, I need to get up here.
[409:41.73]The question is, how do I get up there?
[409:43.79]I want to take a look from here.
[409:50.18]Can you please acknowledge my apology?
[409:51.60]I want forgiveness.
[409:53.92]Um, I don't know what you did.
[409:59.34]There's a very large scale of things that you could have done.
[410:02.73]It's like, did you steal a cookie?
[410:09.41]You're forgiven.
[410:11.50]Did you steal all the cookies?
[410:15.46]Not forgiven.
[410:19.82]There's a big scale there, man.
[410:25.71]Great Katana.
[410:26.51]I just want to see what it looks like.
[410:27.43]Throw their entire body into swinging it.
[410:33.38]Slashing attacks of its own edge incite blood loss.
[410:47.51]I could actually use this too.
[410:48.73]That's the cool thing.
[410:50.83]Holy shit.
[410:51.57]This thing is huge.
[411:13.57]I love it for this alone.
[411:22.80]Holy, that's awesome.
[411:24.54]Hold on.
[411:26.44]How fast does that actually go?
[411:27.74]Wait, this is more.
[411:39.23]This is a different one.
[411:40.15]The R2 is crazy.
[411:41.17]Damn.
[411:49.24]It might be a follow-up, too.
[411:54.40]Not quite.
[412:00.99]Well, that would be really fun to play with.
[412:03.29]But I have my cool weapon.
[412:11.83]So you can do it with one hand.
[412:16.52]Does it get stronger if it's in two hands?
[412:18.00]Because if not, then I'll just keep the raw dagger out.
[412:29.60]Alright, I want to go find this place.
[412:36.00]What the hell are these shoes, man?
[412:37.60]Hey, you play your game the way you play your game, and I'll play my game the way that I play my game.
[412:46.99]I actually have to get used to this moveset.
[412:56.53]I haven't really used it.
[413:04.08]I've been so used to the other movesets that... Okay, so the L... Does it have an L1?
[413:11.24]Okay, it does have an L1.
[413:24.95]I've never used a dual-wield weapon in any of the Souls games ever.
[413:30.09]Because L1 does both.
[413:33.00]Should I be mainly pressing L1?
[413:34.54]Or should I be doing R1 with the dual wield?
[413:47.32]R1 seems better.
[413:48.00]I guess it's for different purposes.
[413:52.94]Like this is a thrust and this is a slash.
[414:03.31]Royal Magic Grease.
[414:04.39]Drawstring Royal Magic Grease.
[414:10.49]Very cool.
[414:14.25]Do R2 into R1 in its sequences.
[414:21.94]That's probably the best move.
[414:29.67]Seems like a lot of different options.
[414:46.48]It's very good.
[414:47.40]It's that was a thousand damage after the sequence.
[414:53.94]OK, well, that's cool now.
[414:56.18]Let's go here.
[415:00.44]Base camp?
[415:00.96]No, I'm going to turn it off for now.
[415:03.33]I'm going to go probably a little low energy here.
[415:09.89]But I'm having a good time.
[415:13.95]Right, I need to get across.
[415:22.12]I'll take that.
[415:32.21]How do I get over there?
[415:40.61]He's going into power saving mode.
[415:42.41]Dude, how come you're not 25 anymore?
[415:57.16]Yeah, I mean, welcome to welcome to aging.
[416:03.92]I'll think about it sometimes and I'll go, man, it's... Did they really start doing the YouTube thing that long ago?
[416:11.28]It feels very far away, but still not really at all.
[416:17.13]It's a very new feeling because I've been an adult for... You know when you're 25?
[416:22.59]You're talking about being 25.
[416:27.37]You kind of think to yourself...
[416:30.06]Oh, man, yeah.
[416:30.86]I mean, yeah, high school wasn't that far away.
[416:33.78]It was, but, you know, it wasn't.
[416:35.02]And then, you know, college and... Okay, yeah, I'm 25.
[416:39.48]There's the milestone.
[416:41.80]Adult milestones are a little different.
[416:44.20]So, going from 25 to 35, you don't really have any of those institutions to really point to.
[416:54.32]So, it's not like, oh, yeah, five years ago, I was in college.
[416:58.67]And I remember.
[417:00.67]It's like 10 years ago, I... I wasn't in college.
[417:05.54]20 years ago, I would... Wait, what?
[417:08.04]You have different milestones, so it gets a little different.
[417:10.46]Feels a little different.
[417:12.22]You having a midlife crisis?
[417:14.78]Uh, no, I got like probably five more years before that happens.
[417:17.98]I think I'm good for a little bit.
[417:19.02]What is a milady?
[417:24.27]A light greatsword that is a sword whose blade matches the length of a greatsword.
[417:30.59]while being constrained to a minimal weight.
[417:34.17]Nicknamed after ladies of noble status for its refined appearance.
[417:38.78]With cultivated form, one can wield this weapon as swiftly as one might a straight sword.
[417:43.72]Really?
[417:43.98]This is kind of thin, isn't it?
[417:55.88]It's the same animations.
[417:57.25]It's the same animations as the things I have.
[418:03.36]Isn't it the same kind of stance?
[418:06.52]Oh, no, no, no.
[418:06.96]It's a little different.
[418:11.71]I love the spin.
[418:19.83]It kind of makes it look like you don't know what the hell you're doing, but I love it.
[418:22.97]Cool.
[418:36.83]Oh wait, I didn't even look at the weapon art.
[418:38.97]Shit, I lost it.
[418:47.94]It's technically a great sword, right?
[418:49.74]Yeah.
[418:53.96]Well, not under the wall.
[419:02.07]That's dirty.
[419:05.73]Big thrusts like that in this game.
[419:09.31]Very, very useful.
[419:11.33]Okay.
[419:12.45]I got those items.
[419:13.44]Now from here... I'm going to take a look because... Is there a ladder over there or something?
[419:29.76]Doesn't look like it.
[419:43.46]The one time I don't want it to be foggy.
[419:47.47]Compost into R1 as well.
[419:48.59]That's cool.
[419:51.39]Alrighty.
[419:52.37]Well.
[419:59.30]Maybe from here.
[419:59.92]Maybe you have to actually go all the way around.
[420:05.70]I'll see if I can go up from here.
[420:13.31]End of the stream voice.
[420:14.07]Nope.
[420:15.09]Still going.
[420:33.20]Crazy.
[420:33.58]Alright, let's go to the map.
[420:40.90]Go get the skidoo tree map.
[420:50.44]Hello?
[421:20.79]Stab him!
[421:22.42]Those guys are really rough.
[421:40.15]So, boat mounted enemy ahead.
[421:51.50]Honestly, I think it's because we were in the water.
[421:52.86]Skadoo Altus.
[422:01.69]Whoa, that's cool.
[422:10.87]Seems like there's a lot of shit here.
[422:12.49]Let's go five.
[422:20.84]And three, actually, let me, I want to clear these.
[422:27.86]One, two, and then maybe three, four.
[422:35.24]See if I can get down here, which would be five.
[422:37.04]Let's do it.
[422:49.51]I would say this zone is... probably gonna be my favorite.
[422:55.17]That is... what is that?
[422:58.11]What planet is that?
[423:02.97]And where are we, by the way?
[423:06.93]Where... where are we?
[423:09.45]Oh, we're... we touched Mikkola's hand and now we ended up in this other world.
[423:29.77]This reminds me of the sword in Night and Flame.
[423:32.05]The sword of Night and Flame, but just way better.
[423:42.29]It does take mana to do that, though.
[423:50.48]Is it a full moon?
[423:56.73]It's either that or the Death Star.
[423:59.08]And that's a different franchise, so it's probably the moon.
[424:16.49]Oh interesting.
[424:24.25]Church of the Crusade.
[424:33.63]Now shout not evade the flame of Messmer.
[424:37.51]This guy again.
[424:39.77]Remember you?
[424:41.48]I'm a little upgraded since the last time we spoke.
[424:47.68]Thank you.
[425:21.87]Queen Marika!
[425:25.66]Behold!
[425:26.60]I have excised another!
[425:29.02]Another cancer to thy joy!
[425:37.26]Oh, Queen Marika, look what I've done.
[425:45.38]Shit.
[425:52.74]Still gotta get used to the moveset.
[425:53.72]It's like learning how to ride a bike that pedals differently.
[425:58.82]It's like trying to learn how to ride a bike with your hands.
[426:02.50]Once you get it going, you know how to sit there and ride it and control it.
[426:07.13]but you gotta pedal with your hands.
[426:29.17]Jesus Christ!
[426:30.45]I'm sorry, that was very scary.
[426:34.51]Oh my goodness.
[426:35.77]That's actually the same one.
[427:19.50]Cooked by a random red guy in a church.
[427:32.46]Yeah, I like the image of you riding upside down on a bike.
[427:36.70]But I would be laying flat on my stomach and my hands would be out pedaling and my feet would be down.
[427:44.94]It would be, like, flat.
[427:47.08]This is a conversation we're not having right now.
[427:49.59]Because it's really dumb.
[427:53.11]More dumber than usual.
[428:12.88]Alright, this little thing shoots later, right?
[428:29.49]That little thing hurts a lot.
[428:34.98]I almost forgot to pick those up.
[428:51.06]He kinda sounds like Flowey.
[429:13.04]You cheap piece of shit.
[429:15.16]I have excised another.
[429:17.65]Another cancer to thy joy.
[429:23.51]Nobody expects the double jump.
[429:25.99]Here we go again.
[429:33.46]Wait, I didn't even talk to you, did I?
[429:34.78]Did I talk to you?
[429:37.36]Boom.
[429:50.16]Mikaela has said as much himself.
[429:52.78]He wishes now to throw it all away.
[429:55.30]He says the act, though undoubtedly painful, will sear clean the Earth-3's wantonness sin.
[430:02.53]The truth of his claim can be found at each cross, which is evidence enough to earn my belief.
[430:12.12]Go to the misshapen tree of Umbra.
[430:14.20]In that forsaken place, blood must spill.
[430:19.00]Well, I mean... I went to a luncheon with them one time.
[430:31.97]I don't really know them.
[430:32.85]I'm not really friends with them.
[430:33.71]I mean, I had a big plate of
[430:46.93]spaghetti pasta and bread and sat there eating it just nodded a few times I just kind of walked up to one of the other circles of people that was like three or four of them standing with the plate of food and just like was slurping up spaghetti and somebody was talking and I just kind of stood there and just was like nodding yeah yeah yeah
[431:19.12]thou shalt not evade the flame of Messmer alright lock in
[431:55.75]This guy is fucking rough.
[432:24.63]I really shouldn't be getting hit this many times.
[432:26.31]I think I might be out of juice.
[432:33.20]I think I'm out of juice.
[432:34.16]Favorite pasta.
[432:54.17]It's also really dark in there.
[432:56.61]Turn the fucking light on.
[432:57.81]Red.
[433:17.92]I beat this guy first try the last time I saw him.
[433:21.13]I'm just kind of slumped over in the chair.
[433:22.75]I expelled all my energy.
[433:26.83]Just on, um, Rallala, Rallala, Rallala, Rallala, Rallala.
[433:36.04]What's that character's name that I just fought?
[433:42.35]Rallala, okay.
[433:43.47]Okay, let's go.
[433:52.08]so so
[434:08.34]Thank you.
[434:31.82]He just... Don't do it.
[434:35.10]Why is this guy giving me so much trouble?
[434:38.82]His weapon is as long as a telephone pole.
[434:43.49]Get the fuck out of here with this thing.
[434:50.81]He's walking around with a stick as... Ugh.
[435:15.13]You're getting beat by somebody with a ball cut.
[435:16.97]Yeah.
[435:21.53]Sometimes those are the most dangerous.
[435:26.41]I could come back at 9th.
[435:29.24]Why would you come back?
[435:30.02]We'd be closed.
[435:33.24]What is happening?
[436:01.07]Dodge spamming!
[436:17.73]What am I drinking?
[436:37.18]That weapon is sick, whatever it is.
[436:38.96]This guy is such an asshole.
[437:06.56]I tried to dodge and I'm just too sloppy right now.
[437:21.47]He's like 10 times stronger than he was last time I saw him.
[437:26.89]I'm trying to get the back.
[437:32.52]Thank you.
[438:11.91]Get out of my face!
[438:12.85]Ash of War flame skewer and prayer room key.
[438:30.95]I'm in sync with your game right now.
[438:33.05]That's always so cool.
[438:35.95]What path did you take?
[438:37.75]And did we all... Who ended up in the same exact spot?
[438:50.64]Alright.
[438:51.34]I got my runes.
[438:56.00]Replace that.
[438:59.44]I can't believe I summoned seven people into that room, and I still didn't beat Rilalna.
[439:16.03]I promise I'm not drunk.
[439:17.29]I haven't had any... I am stone-cold sober right now, I promise.
[439:33.40]Um... I wonder how much that was actually helping me at that fight.
[439:44.48]We can go back to... This one sounds interesting.
[439:49.87]This is technically a chain, right?
[439:56.11]That right there?
[439:56.65]Dun, dun.
[439:57.77]Dun, dun, dun.
[440:00.81]I mean, it's the end of the chain, right?
[440:13.57]I guess what constitutes the end of the chain?
[440:16.83]At least three swings or is it anything that's actually chained together?
[440:20.95]What about HP on chain?
[440:30.43]Just use the successive attack ones.
[440:32.42]Yeah, that's probably a better idea.
[440:37.52]I'm not even sure I have it.
[440:41.62]I don't think I have that.
[440:47.32]Hmm.
[440:59.49]After defeating an enemy?
[441:00.55]I don't think I have it.
[441:11.91]Ooh.
[441:15.15]Oh, that counts!
[441:25.94]I got the whole thing now.
[441:27.72]Alright, cool.
[441:29.46]So... Interesting.
[441:31.32]What is this statue of?
[441:33.73]Erika?
[441:54.47]Thinking level up again.
[441:58.81]But I'm not going to do that because I want to check and see if I can go this way and I can and there's a little ruins here and I want to explore them a little bit.
[442:07.71]I want to go here.
[442:11.14]That's where I want to go.
[442:12.20]I need to explore these ruins, but how do I get over there?
[442:26.03]It was the way to drop down.
[442:27.29]I think that's still across.
[442:32.58]Alright, I did get a key, you're right.
[442:39.22]This is that crazy move.
[442:48.21]Throw this on a spear.
[442:49.69]Good night.
[442:50.83]Opens the door to the prayer room in the house of worship found in the church district of the Shadow Keep.
[442:58.67]Prayer room.
[443:00.04]House of worship.
[443:01.84]Church district of the Shadow Keep.
[443:11.67]That's not over here, is it?
[443:13.75]No, this is Belorat.
[443:19.22]Oh, wait, this one.
[443:22.66]Can you show us the horse?
[443:25.22]Sure, look.
[443:38.34]This is probably Nicola.
[443:41.98]At the very end of the game, we're going to get off Torrent.
[443:46.15]Let's go.
[443:46.79]My Lord, you made it all the way to the end.
[443:49.94]Together we did.
[443:50.78]It's going to get revealed that Torrent is Miquella.
[443:58.57]And we made it here together.
[444:18.19]I think it's going to be a long time before I get... Don't fall.
[444:50.66]How do I quit the game?
[445:00.78]Can't you quit out and... Would I still be falling?
[445:14.95]Dude smoked a bowl in his break and came back and forgot how to play the game.
[445:25.77]Rip your souls.
[445:26.55]It's going to be right on the edge.
[445:33.38]No, I have not done that.
[445:35.42]I am just hanging out.
[445:36.62]I'm just really tired.
[445:38.63]But I don't want to stop playing because it's fun.
[445:40.51]And I want to see more DLC stuff.
[446:00.88]Hold on a sec.
[446:01.38]Can I get up here?
[446:03.26]Is there a bat den up here?
[446:09.73]I made it.
[446:10.21]Where am I?
[446:10.55]I think this is back.
[446:13.21]Yeah, this is the... I've already been here.
[446:19.79]Don't... Please get out of the way.
[446:21.07]It's imperative that I get these.
[446:46.13]Okay, so I should be on the ledge still.
[446:50.03]Let's go.
[446:50.61]I'm kind of in trouble, though.
[446:56.64]I can't move.
[447:01.00]If I get off the horse, will I fall?
[447:03.64]No, we're okay now.
[447:04.88]Thank goodness.
[447:09.67]Alright, so you can not...
[447:13.55]Go this way yet.
[447:15.65]It's all deep, deep, deep, deep, deep down under the ground here.
[447:19.78]So we're going to go to two.
[447:43.16]Oh, is that thing friendly to this settlement here?
[447:47.42]I mean, does not seem like it.
[447:48.92]He's just walking over all these tents.
[447:54.18]If I aggro him, will he just destroy the whole camp?
[447:57.98]Hold on.
[448:16.89]Bro, don't step on any chests, please.
[448:35.82]Uh-oh.
[448:40.60]Alright, would you... Anything here?
[448:42.56]I feel like a little scavenger bird.
[448:57.21]I feel like I just picked a french fry up off the ground or something and it was taking off a squirrel or crow or a rat.
[449:14.39]Hey, come up here.
[449:24.20]Alright, now come all the way into this tower and go fight Messmer.
[449:31.49]I love those videos, by the way.
[449:33.09]Where it's like, can two Orphan of Kossus take on five Bloodhound Knights?
[449:45.23]It's funny that they started getting a little wacky too.
[449:54.35]How many Crucible Knights will it take to kill Malenia?
[449:57.71]Scaled up times two.
[449:58.97]I think I got everything over there.
[450:09.98]Yeah, can 20 Malenia's kill one Godrick Soldier?
[450:19.58]With cheat codes?
[450:24.10]I don't want to destroy everything.
[450:25.12]It's probably stuff in here.
[450:43.13]Who's he doing?
[450:50.57]Run for your lives!
[451:00.11]Run for your lives, a giant!
[451:02.24]Run for your lives!
[451:05.92]Listen, a giant!
[451:09.34]At least, no, we don't have any quarrels together.
[451:11.18]The giant is among us!
[451:25.68]Thanks for watching!
[452:00.35]Oh, must be Messmer.
[452:11.46]Somewhere a great rune has broken?
[452:14.90]And so too has a powerful charm.
[452:17.09]What?
[452:24.23]What the fuck are you talking about?
[452:28.54]Somebody just crushed the biggest Crunchy ever.
[452:32.05]They're probably making a YouTube video.
[452:35.37]I broke the biggest Crunchy ever in Elden Ring.
[452:37.81]And this is how I did it.
[452:44.78]And it ended up being 25 million souls.
[452:47.46]Which is crazy.
[453:08.91]Hey, chat.
[453:11.13]Hey, somebody said, hey, chat.
[453:12.93]Can you, hey, I got to get it right.
[453:15.45]I don't want to say your joke wrong.
[453:16.43]It was very good.
[453:17.87]Hey, chat.
[453:19.25]Can you, I'm going to, I can't even get your joke right.
[453:22.21]Hey, chat.
[453:23.93]I'm going to let you borrow this great rune.
[453:25.78]Can you please take care of it?
[453:29.00]Good one.
[453:41.90]It's kind of freaky.
[453:55.56]This is kind of freaky in here.
[453:59.69]This is the Shadow Keep.
[454:02.27]OK, this is where I need to bring the key.
[454:05.37]What's happening here?
[454:09.98]No, fuck you.
[454:11.56]Get it right.
[454:14.44]No, get it right!
[454:15.48]The golden hippopotamus!
[454:30.91]Cool.
[454:37.47]I love him.
[454:48.18]This might be Miquella.
[454:48.78]What are you doing?
[455:07.51]What are you doing?
[455:19.97]Oh, he does it twice.
[455:28.55]Okay.
[455:29.17]This is a cool fight.
[455:29.99]I can do this.
[455:47.46]Oh, I need those souls right now.
[455:50.34]Actually let's do this right.
[456:04.72]Let's do this the correct way.
[456:15.85]Can the hippopotamus be rotted?
[456:17.97]Yes, hippopotamus is rotted.
[456:21.37]I'm back against the wall.
[456:26.19]I don't want to be.
[456:38.36]Okay.
[456:40.53]So going from the light weapon attack spammer to the slow hippopotamus, it's quite the change in pace.
[457:00.20]Now I can do this without a summon for sure.
[457:23.86]I'm just, I'm just very, oh god.
[457:31.01]Is there a, like a Homeward Bone?
[457:32.49]I forget in Elden Ring.
[457:33.59]It's been a while.
[457:34.07]Because I kind of want to just use these so I don't have to keep picking them up.
[457:36.97]I don't know if there is, right?
[457:57.30]Walk on, what are you doing?
[458:05.25]I might also just pick this up tomorrow.
[458:08.19]Because I am very tired and I'm definitely out of gamer juice.
[458:12.35]Absolutely.
[458:13.59]But I might be able to do it.
[458:24.99]That was a weird hitbox.
[458:42.14]Oh, actually, wait a minute.
[458:43.58]I think I have some of those.
[458:45.56]No, I do.
[458:46.02]Okay, here's what we're going to do.
[458:47.94]I think the little twigs, right?
[458:49.38]The sacrificial twigs?
[458:52.59]Don't I have some?
[459:00.79]I have some.
[459:01.91]I swear I had some.
[459:05.32]Oh, it's a talisman, right?
[459:10.10]Yeah, I have a lot of these.
[459:10.96]Okay, yeah.
[459:12.88]I don't have to keep doing this over and over again.
[459:21.75]Okay.
[459:41.34]Falling off the same cliff twice solidified that fact?
[459:43.92]Yeah.
[459:55.15]What is it to level up? 176.
[460:15.51]I love your streams, but you're kind of fucked right now.
[460:18.70]Eh, I'm alright.
[460:22.20]So, is the goal here just to get... Just kind of the... Should I just keep dumping points?
[460:29.40]I'll get them, whatever.
[460:30.06]Where should I put these?
[460:39.52]Yep, endurance back to 30.
[460:40.48]Okay, now that I don't need to worry about that, let me actually try to play the game now.
[460:47.25]Let's do it.
[460:47.67]I'll try it a few times.
[460:53.81]Uh.
[460:56.31]I thought I dove.
[460:57.35]I thought I dodged.
[461:06.94]Dodging into his mouth.
[461:09.84]It's a great plan.
[461:19.80]That's so funny.
[461:23.93]This is going to be a really fun fight.
[461:28.87]Tomorrow.
[461:31.57]Alright.
[461:32.35]I'm going to walk in there one more time and we'll go for it.
[461:39.18]Should I even do more physical damage, maybe?
[461:46.49]Oh, I can't use that.
[461:47.43]Maybe just more stamina.
[462:08.94]Okay, what?
[462:10.40]The timing on that is very odd.
[462:12.29]Because he gets close enough, but then he doesn't do it.
[462:17.57]It's a very weird timing.
[462:18.35]You almost have to be inside of him before he does the move.
[462:29.96]Maybe roll back?
[462:31.56]Because I don't... Is it like a back roll?
[462:35.10]And he just misses you?
[462:35.88]Or just a sidestep maybe?
[462:45.42]OK, yeah, it's a side step.
[462:56.90]Holy shit, I thought he's gonna do the slow one.
[463:10.27]Oh fuck, I'm being so timid with it.
[463:20.58]Get out of my face, please.
[463:27.38]Alright, so it's... That is hard, too, because it's 1-2.
[463:30.21]It's not slow.
[463:52.57]Jesus.
[463:58.64]Right, OK, so he goes one, two, and that's it.
[464:03.48]Turn off the lock on and run.
[464:04.99]Yeah, dodging him seems just the hitbox seems very weird with his his mouth.
[464:32.68]so slow yeah you know I I definitely need to like sleep forget about the the okay yeah I know what's happening that ranala fight whatever it was I I did like 100 times and fighting an enemy that takes so long to do everything is just I'm just like hurry up and swing your five swords already
[465:09.25]Alright, don't attack until he can because when you get close he just kind of... That one's weird too.
[465:21.51]It's almost like his mouth takes up too much of the screen.
[465:30.80]I'm telling you it's weird.
[465:31.80]I'm telling you it's weird.
[465:43.55]Sucks.
[465:52.30]It's like fighting Margit for the first time again, yeah.
[466:04.61]So you need to map out kind of where to play because go fight all the really slow enemies and then fight all the really fast enemies.
[466:14.58]You gotta get that fast versus slow muscle memory.
[466:28.52]Maybe maybe dodging is the wrong idea.
[466:43.57]What's wrong with that?
[467:17.06]God damn it.
[467:18.62]Okay.
[467:19.48]Don't.
[467:19.98]You have to run from that move.
[467:21.59]I don't think.
[467:22.05]That is not a dodge move at all.
[467:23.53]0.0.
[467:24.49]That is a run away move.
[467:41.80]Let's try it.
[467:50.14]I actually don't know what that move is.
[468:00.25]Maybe it's just a really small frame window.
[468:18.29]Okay, rewind that and watch that back frame by frame and you tell me what the hell you're supposed to do about this fucking giant hippo.
[468:47.21]You're the type of person that would own a cemetery.
[468:48.99]Does that make sense?
[468:55.48]Um, no, actually not.
[468:57.28]I am really not.
[468:58.13]Trust me.
[469:14.53]Oh my god, that has an AOE around it.
[469:16.47]I thought it was just his body.
[469:19.11]No!
[469:24.99]I don't know.
[469:25.83]I thought ghosts could fucking come out and shit.
[469:27.52]I don't know.
[469:27.82]And it's dark.
[469:29.02]I'm a sunlight guy.
[469:32.76]I am a sun beaming down on you basking in the golden Earth tree.
[469:40.32]They said creamery.
[469:54.92]Of course you're not going to do the one that I want to test.
[469:56.70]You're going to do this bullshit.
[469:59.37]Alright, do it.
[470:05.09]I want to see if I just run.
[470:10.17]Dude, how do you get away from this?
[470:11.64]I don't know how you get away from this move.
[470:13.68]I don't know how you get away from this move.
[470:15.22]I'm going to try to jump.
[470:30.93]Nope.
[470:40.66]Dodge does work, but you just have to be really... The hitbox is really big.
[470:54.91]The hitbox has a giant square on his head.
[471:07.61]Alright, last attempt and I'm going to bed.
[471:10.17]It's only 8.30, what am I talking about?
[471:14.21]I think, okay, it's sprint and then dodge.
[471:20.08]I think that's the only way you can really get away from it.
[471:39.23]Alright, let's try it again.
[471:40.35]Nope.
[471:48.05]Alright, I want to test it.
[471:48.89]Do it.
[471:51.25]Yeah, okay.
[471:52.11]You have to sprint sideways and then dodge when he gets there because the hitbox is so big.
[471:58.08]I got it.
[471:58.66]Alright.
[472:11.67]Geez, that's a long move.
[472:37.51]Uh-oh.
[472:46.21]No, that's not fair, but I got panic rolled and it worked.
[473:24.94]You actually might just need to be far enough away from it.
[473:37.03]Shit.
[473:39.81]This is a bad place to be.
[473:41.55]What the fuck is going on?
[473:45.61]What is this porcupine doing?
[473:49.17]Okay.
[474:25.05]Damn, alright.
[474:25.87]Oh, I understand it now.
[474:29.73]Sonic the Hedgehog Hippopotamus.
[474:33.97]Please give the hippo a name.
[475:00.06]Hold on, I will in a minute.
[475:11.58]Thank you.
[475:38.75]I don't, where am I?
[475:39.71]Alright, that move doesn't really help me that much.
[476:16.76]There he goes.
[476:26.30]Oh, shit.
[476:27.74]Okay, those just spam everywhere.
[476:44.31]Spammer versus spammer.
[476:47.50]That's how it is, right?
[476:50.04]I want to do it one more time.
[476:51.92]This is truly the last one.
[476:53.42]I'm not going to beat him, but I'm trying to learn.
[476:56.18]Getting greedy.
[477:09.95]One swing and get out.
[477:10.75]That's it.
[477:21.03]I wonder if staying close is a good idea.
[477:22.85]I wonder.
[477:25.49]No, it's not.
[478:13.71]Really, really weird place when you inside of his body.
[478:35.80]Ugh, that one, two, three, then he does it.
[479:05.67]At least I'm gonna see the porcupine again.
[479:10.75]Oh my god, the fucking delay is so annoying!
[479:50.38]This fight I feel like is going to be really, really, really hard.
[479:56.67]It's just so big.
[480:10.82]Yeah, when I walked in here, I was like, oh my God, a hippo.
[480:12.70]I'm going to.
[480:13.26]He's going to be.
[480:13.86]It's going to be like dodge swing dog.
[480:16.28]No, this.
[480:16.62]Guys crazy.
[480:21.53]My last attempt for real and I actually mean it this time.
[480:27.03]Kind of new strategy.
[481:03.97]No, I'm not locked on, but it's OK.
[481:18.75]It's gonna make me crazy.
[481:19.81]Yeah, I thought I was gonna do this low one.
[481:48.44]Running right into a wall.
[481:52.45]Oh my goodness.
[481:57.25]This is bad.
[481:58.87]This is bad.
[481:59.57]This is very bad.
[482:05.85]Rod is doing some work though.
[482:29.58]Bye.
[482:29.68]I'll see you tomorrow.
[482:44.14]That was bullshit.
[482:44.98]I dodged right through it.
[482:45.88]I didn't even get hit by him.
[482:46.66]I get hit by the fucking bookcase.
[483:03.02]What the fuck are you?
[483:05.04]I dodged it.
[483:22.43]I'm trying to... I don't want to hit the button that many times in a row.
[483:31.77]Maybe I don't need to dodge.
[483:51.48]Let this tick for a little while.
[484:09.94]Did you guys know that depending on where you typically dodge in Elden Ring, it says a lot about your personality.
[484:19.28]Those of you that dodge left are creative.
[484:25.49]You like to come up with stories.
[484:28.07]Those of you that dodge right are more logical.
[484:32.75]And those of you that dodge back are just plain stupid.
[484:49.03]You dodge forward, you have your eyes on the prize, and you really like to step forward in your life, do new things, try new foods.
[485:03.43]Now, backdodgers are cautious.
[485:06.63]They like to see things from bird's eye view and get perspectives from all team members.
[485:20.38]Shield uses.
[485:21.68]Shield uses.
[485:22.56]I'm tired.
[485:23.24]I am.
[485:23.78]I'm going to bed.
[485:27.70]When you start like drunk talking without having any alcohol in your system, and I mean zero.
[485:36.91]Time to hang up the stream here.
[485:41.23]Shield uses.
[485:44.59]I have both headphones in too.
[485:46.97]And I notoriously speech jam myself when I have both ears blocked.
[485:51.72]But for Elden Ring and games like this, I have to do it.
[485:54.98]So I can kind of not really hear myself, which I typically can.
[485:58.12]I'm going to go to bed in one minute.
[486:08.01]I just want to scrape my face against the wall.
[486:24.35]The wall ended.
[486:24.91]Alright.
[486:31.17]Good night, guys.
[486:31.51]See you later.
[486:32.39]I'll be live tomorrow.
[486:33.11]Probably around the same time.
[486:34.06]Around like 12, 1.
[486:34.62]Give or take.
[486:40.68]I love Elden Ring.
[486:41.92]I love Elden Ring.
[486:42.98]I love Elden Ring.
[486:43.74]It's very fun.
[486:45.66]The DLC is amazing.
[486:47.02]I love it.
[486:47.54]I'm having a blast.
[486:49.96]I want to know what's going on inside of this Skadoo tree.
[486:59.62]Hope you had fun.
[487:01.74]I know there's a lot of streams here.
[487:03.65]There's three days in a row.
[487:09.23]But I did say I was just going to stream when I wanted to and I want to.
[487:14.33]I'm feeling it.
[487:15.06]Let's go.
[487:20.35]Probably more of the same tomorrow.
[487:22.55]Probably go camless for a lot of it.
[487:23.76]Turn it on for parts of it.
[487:26.66]And then fall into low energy mode near the end.
[487:29.58]Maybe even the beginning too.
[487:30.50]Maybe we just go low energy tomorrow.
[487:33.54]I don't know.
[487:33.80]We'll see.
[487:34.14]It depends on how angry I get at the video game.
[487:42.42]I think I'm not going to go in here.
[487:45.25]What I would like to do tomorrow.
[487:46.85]Let me plan out what I want to do tomorrow.
[487:49.68]I'm going to go.
[487:50.50]I want to go down here.
[487:53.08]We know that hippopotamus is right here.
[487:54.62]Actually, I'm going to put it at the Grace.
[487:56.84]Yeah.
[487:59.29]I kind of want to check this out.
[488:01.45]And then down here, this is where I wanted to go originally.
[488:10.51]This place is going to be crazy that that's a boss of the entrance, but this place seems huge.
[488:19.81]How big is this place compared to this one?
[488:22.35]This one was big too.
[488:26.79]Looks like there's more.
[488:29.75]Wow.
[488:31.27]There's a lot more.
[488:36.71]This goes all... You can see the border here.
[488:39.39]Does this go all the way down here?
[488:40.76]Holy shit.
[488:48.49]And then it's all this up here.
[488:54.90]Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
[489:00.84]Take care of yourselves.
[489:02.42]Have a great day.
[489:03.46]Have a great rest of your night.
[489:05.46]See you soon.
[489:06.32]Thanks for watching, as always.
[489:09.99]Call your mother.
[489:14.47]Drink some water.
[489:20.39]Take it easy.
[489:22.17]See you later.
[489:35.86]Sorry, I just did that to you.
[489:36.74]I thought it was gonna be funny.
[489:46.02]Oh.
[490:25.01]Go sun your stone lawn.
[490:35.67]Praise the sun.
[490:36.52]I love the sun.
[490:37.02]Alright.
[490:38.33]See you later.
