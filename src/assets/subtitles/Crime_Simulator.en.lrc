[ve:61.1.100]

[00:00.03]Thank you.
[00:26.17]How's it going?
[00:28.36]Welcome!
[00:30.93]Good morning to some of you, good afternoon to a lot of you, good evening to, uh...
[00:36.41]whoever is in Europe, I guess.
[00:43.24]How are you today?
[00:46.64]Oh that's great.
[00:56.34]Yeah, for one day only, we're going to be playing something on stream just for one day.
[01:04.38]Today we've got the horsemen are available.
[01:10.87]So me, stirpoke, and Vinny.
[01:16.68]I have to update the chat Christmas presents terms of service, guys.
[01:21.53]I'm sorry.
[01:22.18]Here's my... Just wait.
[01:25.97]Don't freak out.
[01:30.57]Classic.
[01:31.15]Don't say classic yet because I might not need to.
[01:36.74]let's talk about the good news okay here let's go over good news first uh Infinity Nikki
[01:43.46]the clay stream, and You Laugh, You Lose are ready to go.
[01:52.50]Those will be happening in the next week or so.
[01:57.05]I have been...
[01:57.79]Here's the thing with Windows 11.
[02:00.69]I have been trying to get Casino Inc. and the movies to work.
[02:06.76]uh there's there's like one guy who's doing patches in a steam discussion thread
[02:16.04]Thank God for this guy, by the way.
[02:20.52]It's almost impossible to get these games to run.
[02:23.09]You can almost... One of them, Casino Inc., you can open them.
[02:27.03]But it needs like a community patch and even the community patch sometimes doesn't work.
[02:32.26]I have an idea, and there's a couple of ideas.
[02:35.99]I think I'm going to just get an old actual Windows XP computer.
[02:42.91]refurbish it, get it ready, and I can just literally natively play old PC games on this thing?
[02:51.55]Because I've done the virtual machine thing before.
[02:54.57]And I always have problems doing a virtual machine.
[03:02.32]You're gonna refurbish it yourself?
[03:04.41]Well, I mean, just like clear it out and do whatever.
[03:08.55]Yeah, I would just be pulling the video feed.
[03:13.15]I feel like if you turn, yeah, you don't want that computer to be connected to the internet.
[03:18.28]I feel like if you connect that computer to the internet, like, oh yeah, I've got my Windows XP computer, sure, I'd like to join the wireless network.
[03:26.23]Uh, I don't, no.
[03:29.96]but I can pull the video feed from just the computer itself, just the video feed of the computer into a capture card.
[03:41.03]Effectively, it'll be a streaming PC setup.
[03:44.18]But... My streaming PC will be the one I'm using right now.
[03:48.96]And an old Windows XP piece of shit laptop will be the other one.
[03:54.93]Now with that being said, that might not happen in the next four days.
[04:00.91]That's going to take a little bit of time.
[04:03.38]So I'm amending
[04:05.90]the chat Christmas present terms of service due to potential unforeseen weather conditions
[04:12.65]or operating systems that are so far out that they physically almost can't work, and a virtual machine is fucking annoying, and I've done it before,
[04:22.34]And I run into... Oh, you forgot.
[04:24.24]You emulated the wrong sound drivers.
[04:27.50]And sometimes it doesn't work.
[04:28.76]Sometimes it crashes my computer.
[04:30.37]So I'm amending the chat Christmas present.
[04:34.87]the movies and Casino Inc. might be a few days into February.
[04:41.85]Maybe not.
[04:42.35]We'll see.
[04:42.74]We'll see how quickly I can do this.
[04:44.97]Because I've been trying to do this for the last few days, trying to get this to work.
[04:52.84]You can play Deltarune to remedy this.
[04:56.71]No, what I'm going to do...
[04:59.66]Sorry, chatter.
[05:00.75]Here's what I'm going to do.
[05:03.40]Here's the consolation prize to those of you that have wanted that in January.
[05:06.69]But whatever.
[05:07.30]It doesn't matter.
[05:09.08]Look.
[05:09.59]It's- it said out for delivery, and it- the package is kind of sl- oh, it's not here yet.
[05:16.21]Oh, but it's out for delivery!
[05:17.52]Fuck, what happened?
[05:18.97]Okay.
[05:20.45]Uh, I'm gonna play Sorcery Part 4.
[05:24.44]We will play Sorcery Part 4 to replace it.
[05:29.31]And then you just get all the presents, okay?
[05:31.46]How about that?
[05:36.01]I actually checked to make sure.
[05:37.72]Yes, the sorcery playthrough is intact.
[05:40.73]And it's exactly where I left off.
[05:43.26]So we are good to go.
[05:44.89]We're gonna have to get a quick refresher though, because that is literally the last part.
[05:49.61]And I...
[05:51.04]It's gonna be interesting.
[05:52.59]I will play that at least once.
[05:59.98]It's a Christmas miracle he's gonna play so- Well, I feel kind of bad.
[06:04.55]I felt bad because you guys picked every single thing besides that and that's the thing I think I've been asked to do the most.
[06:11.33]Okay, you know what?
[06:12.48]Let me be real.
[06:13.83]I feel like three of you have asked me to play Infinity Nikki.
[06:18.81]Maybe four of you total out of the million and a half people that have been here before.
[06:24.91]So that's the ultimate one guy.
[06:28.33]In fact, I'm not even sure why it was a Christmas present.
[06:30.35]I just remember seeing it.
[06:31.26]I remember seeing people, hey, when are you going to do the, are you going to do that?
[06:34.95]I really was looking forward to that.
[06:36.12]It was probably the same three people.
[06:41.86]But, so there you go, we'll just do them all.
[06:49.57]How far do you think you would get in Lord of the Rings if you had the one ring and you had to get it over to Mount Doom?
[06:55.78]Uh...
[07:03.46]I feel like I'd get to Mordor and say I'm done.
[07:10.28]It's like, we're frolicking with the butterflies.
[07:13.99]Oh, and this Gimli, you know.
[07:15.85]And there's, oh, Legolas, and he's incredibly talented.
[07:18.74]Boom.
[07:18.88]Oh, and of course there's me.
[07:20.91]Oh, and we're in the field.
[07:22.10]And all the poppies.
[07:23.61]Poppies.
[07:24.77]Great, that's fine.
[07:25.36]We get to Mordor.
[07:26.66]And I'm done.
[07:27.63]I'd be like, hey, one of you guys has to take this because I'm fucking going home.
[07:30.00]I'm done.
[07:30.47]This is not the fun part.
[07:38.15]I would do the fun stuff and maybe a little bit of light combat, right?
[07:43.33]But if I had, look, give me that magic Mithril shirt.
[07:46.73]I'll do some fighting.
[07:54.54]Who would you be?
[07:55.32]Okay.
[07:56.11]You would stop at Lothalron?
[08:00.31]I don't...
[08:01.01]Hold on.
[08:01.30]I'm going to make a lot of people angry.
[08:02.72]I'm not a big Lord of the Rings guy.
[08:05.80]I think it's cool.
[08:08.41]It's Mithril.
[08:09.09]What do you mean?
[08:10.00]How do you say it?
[08:10.78]Mithril?
[08:12.39]What's wrong with you?
[08:14.90]It's Mithril.
[08:16.74]Mithril.
[08:19.89]Lothlorien, the Elven Woods.
[08:29.20]That guy just called you a liberal.
[08:31.89]The fuck did you just call me?
[08:35.53]Sorry, I gotta settle down.
[08:36.61]Hold on a minute, I have to settle.
[08:37.72]Hold on, let me settle down.
[08:49.57]Oh, he's coming it on.
[08:54.34]If you were rotated constantly, would you prefer horizontally or vertically?
[08:59.06]Horizontally.
[09:01.41]Nah, vertically would be awful.
[09:02.77]It'd be terrible.
[09:06.36]How fast is it going?
[09:07.27]Is it fast or slow?
[09:17.24]Wait, why do you have to be a liberal to watch Lord of the Rings?
[09:20.18]Is that what I'm getting at this here?
[09:21.81]What are you talking about?
[09:30.47]Chat's being silly.
[09:31.70]Yeah.
[09:34.60]Go Patriots, I guess.
[09:35.89]Yeah, go Patriots.
[09:39.37]Lord of the woke.
[09:43.83]Okay.
[09:50.13]How is the primate movie?
[09:51.44]I haven't seen it.
[09:52.36]I want to see it, though.
[09:55.74]Dude, I want to go to the primate movie and with 3D glasses and just be like, this is
[10:00.26]It's crazy how you guys don't see the 3D.
[10:10.47]What planet would you like to blee?
[10:13.38]I don't know.
[10:13.79]There's like eight of them.
[10:14.77]Who cares?
[10:17.74]I feel like Neptune's the coolest planet.
[10:20.61]Neptune's cool.
[10:22.58]Nobody talks about Neptune.
[10:23.69]Everyone's like, oh, but what about Mars?
[10:25.88]And, well, look out, there's Mercury.
[10:29.03]Neptune is crazy.
[10:31.38]That is a bright blue planet that just hangs out and casts...
[10:36.44]It's where we get all of our cold.
[10:39.19]Mars has all the heat and that's how we get the heat on Earth.
[10:42.46]But Neptune does the cold temperatures.
[10:45.91]that come through the atmosphere.
[10:46.95]So I like to give Neptune a little bit of credit.
[11:03.10]You guys can't be serious.
[11:04.55]Do you guys seriously?
[11:05.46]Do you guys can't take shit that I say that seriously?
[11:07.45]Are you kidding me?
[11:10.15]The amount of question marks that I just saw, rather than like, oh, LOL, as concerning to me.
[11:25.88]What time is it in ancient Greece?
[11:28.14]What time is it in Greece right now?
[11:30.36]What a stupid question.
[11:32.40]Anyways...
[11:34.49]I think we're...
[11:35.10]I think... Are we ready to go?
[11:36.93]I don't think... We're probably not ready.
[11:38.62]I think a couple people were not quite ready.
[11:41.96]I was going to just chill and talk a little bit anyways.
[11:52.51]What letter do you think looks best in uppercase but the worst in lowercase?
[11:59.46]Mmm...
[12:01.84]I think an uppercase I is really powerful, but a lowercase I is kind of, ooh, it's kind of a wuss, right?
[12:19.90]Like, I don't feel bad about not capitalizing any other letter besides I.
[12:24.82]If you start a sentence with a lowercase I, it's like, holy shit, what a wuss.
[12:29.87]Right?
[12:35.53]Like that's not correct.
[12:37.92]Something about that sentence is not right.
[12:49.19]Hey, are you going to Uber Eats a Windows XP PC, like poked at a PS5?
[12:53.37]Guys, you can't do that.
[12:56.10]The only people selling Windows XP PCs are dudes on eBay that found it in their parents' closet.
[13:06.64]And maybe can make some money off it.
[13:09.92]There's no... You can't just go get one of these.
[13:13.63]Facebook Marketplace.
[13:14.96]Yeah.
[13:22.40]Is it true that you have mountain time as a time zone?
[13:24.56]I mean, I think there were four time zones.
[13:28.02]There's Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern.
[13:32.82]Isn't there, wait, isn't there one goofy time zone too?
[13:39.57]in the United States.
[13:43.38]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:44.94]I'm talking continental United States.
[13:48.56]Yes, Alaska, Hawaii.
[13:50.28]I'm talking about continental United States.
[13:57.76]The amount of stalling is unheard of.
[13:59.73]I'm just hanging out.
[14:00.58]What do you want me to do?
[14:01.77]We're just chilling.
[14:05.22]I wanted to be live a little early so I could just hang out.
[14:11.67]And we're going to catch up with the boys.
[14:13.39]It's been a little while.
[14:17.20]eBay sells refurbished XP computers?
[14:22.63]I'll figure it out.
[14:23.35]I'll figure it out.
[14:24.32]I might just go for it and do a virtual machine, but it sucks such asshole.
[14:29.17]I've done it a few times for various things.
[14:32.62]And every time I get, I get like two days into the process of troubleshooting and I go, what the fuck are you doing?
[14:41.08]Just go get a Windows 95 computer and pull it.
[14:44.89]Pull the video feed.
[14:46.36]So I know I'm going to say that to myself in like three days.
[14:50.71]I'm going to sit there and say, you were on stream this time talking about that three days in the future, this is going to happen to you.
[14:58.01]And look what happened.
[15:00.70]Tech illiterate?
[15:01.93]I have- no, dude, setting up a virtual machine can be annoying.
[15:05.51]Especially with XP.
[15:08.97]The amount of service packs, the amount of sound drivers and video driver emulation, it's a fucking pain in the ass.
[15:23.60]And I've done it before.
[15:24.74]I've gotten to the point where it's boots up.
[15:27.83]Here you are.
[15:28.54]Oh my God, I can move my mouse on this other fake computer.
[15:32.29]And then I will try to install a game and it just won't work.
[15:36.42]And I'll be, I don't know what happened.
[15:38.01]And then you have to, I said this before in pre-stream chat, but I'm going to say for the live viewers,
[15:42.28]You end up in a scenario where you are two thirds of the way done installing your virtual machine.
[15:48.54]and you have a massive problem that you can't fix, so you go look it up, and there's one fucking guy on AskJeeves.com from 2007
[15:57.28]that has your exact problem in a thread that there are no replies to.
[16:06.99]That is my exact problem.
[16:08.69]This guy explained the exact issue 14 years ago, no replies.
[16:16.27]Or the dude replies to himself, bumps his own thread three weeks later, says, I fixed that problem.
[16:23.74]Hey, edit, I fixed that problem, but you know what's happening now is I've got a black screen and it's like, bro, what'd you do to fix part one?
[16:32.11]Give me the part one.
[16:33.66]What did you do at part one?
[16:39.94]So it can be a pain in the ass.
[16:41.05]And I know some of you are going to say, hey, dude, it's actually pretty easy.
[16:44.56]And that's fine.
[16:47.33]That's okay.
[16:48.97]but I have gone through this process before.
[16:51.14]And sometimes the virtual machine
[16:54.44]software sucks and just fucking bricks your whole computer.
[16:59.03]Dude, I've had a situation where I've got it already, and when I go to turn on the virtual machine,
[17:04.31]the VM just bricks and just stops responding.
[17:09.80]And I have to, I can't even turn it off.
[17:19.50]Hey dude, it's actually pretty easy.
[17:22.15]Use x86 box, VM is not emulation, that is.
[17:28.29]but is x86 box like dos box though I've never used x86 box is that I've also heard of pc what is it pc something
[17:39.55]PCM.
[17:40.37]Yeah.
[17:45.20]I'm gonna...
[17:46.51]Here's what we're gonna do.
[17:48.16]I'm gonna try my damnedest...
[17:50.60]to do it with either emulation or I'm trying casino inc and the movies both need some form of fixing
[17:57.89]especially Casino Inc.
[18:03.96]Casino Inc. on Windows 11, it will open.
[18:07.16]But... the characters... don't have animations.
[18:13.36]So they kind of just float around.
[18:15.17]And I'm like, what the fuck?
[18:16.01]I played this on Windows 10.
[18:18.76]Oh, of course.
[18:19.62]And I'm going to say another thing here.
[18:21.61]I'm going to say another thing here.
[18:24.55]World of Warcraft... Let's turn the music down for this, because this is important.
[18:28.73]World of Warcraft has been running for about 20-something years.
[18:35.15]They came to the realization a handful of years ago, like about five, seven years ago, that people like their old game more than the fucking new one.
[18:44.51]So they made wow classic and it generates them a absolute shitload of money.
[18:51.60]Why?
[18:54.05]Has Microsoft not made a Windows Classic?
[18:57.61]Do you know how many fucking idiots like me would buy that?
[19:00.31]I would pay probably like a subscription service, like a World of Warcraft subscription, if I got a Windows Classic.
[19:08.54]Not Windows 11.
[19:10.29]Not WoW Retail.
[19:12.02]I don't want to fucking play WoW Retail.
[19:13.91]And I'm not going to.
[19:16.27]but I sure would like to play World of Warcraft XP.
[19:20.53]I would love to have a Windows XP that works.
[19:23.63]All the old software can work.
[19:26.82]If you have old programs, you can just run them.
[19:29.01]It'll run natively.
[19:30.52]There's got to be a way they can figure that out.
[19:32.72]Even if it's through emulation, I don't care.
[19:37.97]They make more money selling your data than from a subscription.
[19:40.89]Just let me use the software that's...
[19:42.97]cool and fun and everybody loved it.
[19:45.64]World of Warcraft did this.
[19:46.95]You can do it too, Windows.
[19:48.26]Come on, man.
[19:52.00]The amount of times I close the copilot window, that's enough clicks for me to click on three more times to open a subscription for WoW Windows Classic.
[20:00.55]You understand?
[20:08.64]Linux users on the way to tell you it's superior.
[20:10.67]I know it is.
[20:13.85]Linux is the far superior product.
[20:16.84]It is a far superior product.
[20:23.10]It isn't.
[20:25.51]That somebody, whatever.
[20:26.70]And Linux is just, if you know it, you use it.
[20:29.49]But the problem is you have to know it.
[20:31.34]You have to go for it.
[20:32.80]And a lot of stuff doesn't work for it.
[20:34.89]And years ago, wait, people, I think they're waiting for me.
[20:39.82]No, they're not.
[20:40.26]Okay, we're good.
[20:43.47]Use it for a day and then say that.
[20:45.37]Let me clarify my position.
[20:51.18]I have not used Linux.
[20:53.56]I have used
[20:55.45]stuff that is built on Linux, right?
[20:58.08]I mean, isn't all Mac built on Linux effectively?
[21:03.02]They have a fork of Linux or whatever it is, or Unix, whatever it is.
[21:09.77]Unix.
[21:10.41]Oh, okay.
[21:19.46]You're talking about Java.
[21:24.26]Here's the TL;DR.
[21:25.67]as here and I'm going to say again as windows gets worse and worse and worse
[21:32.34]I feel like they're going to run into a World of Warcraft scenario where they will have a market share amount of customers
[21:40.32]who don't want the new WoW retail to a point where they're
[21:45.33]potentially gonna make like a Windows 7 with updates and it's backwards compatible and it works and it can connect to the internet.
[21:53.80]I would hope that happens.
[21:57.85]We're already at that point.
[21:58.82]We are, but not to a point, I don't think, where it hurts the bottom line.
[22:05.39]That's never gonna happen.
[22:06.54]I know, but I'm living in a fantasy fucking fake world right now.
[22:09.95]I'm making the whole thing up.
[22:12.08]In my fantasy world...
[22:14.49]I have the Windows launcher, right?
[22:16.46]I have my Battle.net launcher.
[22:19.22]And would you like to open up fucking Windows Classic today?
[22:22.17]Yes, I would.
[22:22.87]That's what I want to use.
[22:23.84]Please.
[22:26.03]And you know how much dust would get covered all over the Windows 11 button?
[22:29.46]It would be covered in fucking grime.
[22:32.37]It would be covered in dust and fucking...
[22:35.06]cigarette ashes from the fucking 80s I would never click it ever anyways I don't want to get excited today
[22:51.29]I don't want to get too excited.
[22:58.50]You should play WoW Classic again.
[22:59.92]Why didn't TBC just came out?
[23:01.41]Maybe, I don't know.
[23:05.97]Let me call the boys.
[23:07.54]I gotta calm down.
[23:08.23]Let me call the boys.
[23:11.28]It's already a reality.
[23:12.81]You can use Windows 95 with Linux effectively.
[23:16.74]I know, but here's the, like...
[23:17.93]Okay, one last thing.
[23:19.52]Is this one of those situations where I can... Oh, man, dude, I can get Windows 95 to work with...
[23:24.20]it's a a front end for Linux oh hell yeah let me connect to my wi-fi
[23:29.58]Oh, fuck, I just got every worm that's ever been let out into the wild because I don't have any fucking security updates.
[23:37.14]Like...
[23:37.70]Is it gonna happen?
[23:38.77]Will you get fucking destroyed?
[23:43.93]I feel like I would get served one ad from some random, like a website I was going to, and it would fucking, I would get like a fucking virus.
[23:53.36]That would be a good stream event.
[23:56.07]The system is in a sandbox.
[24:00.27]What do you mean worm?
[24:01.13]You guys don't know what a worm is?
[24:04.73]Grow up, everybody!
[24:06.24]Quick!
[24:08.84]I'm calling him.
[24:14.83]What's going on?
[24:23.33]How we doing?
[24:27.26]How are things?
[24:29.35]Yo.
[24:30.64]Hey, pals.
[24:32.31]Hey.
[24:33.96]It's nice to hear from you guys again.
[24:36.15]How are you doing?
[24:36.79]How's life?
[24:37.70]Yeah, how's life?
[24:40.73]It's alright.
[24:42.36]It's going good.
[24:43.26]Same old.
[24:43.58]Month.
[24:46.01]You guys ready to simulate some crimes?
[24:50.48]Yeah, I could use some crimes.
[24:54.09]I'm in a storm right now.
[24:55.66]Yeah, are you good?
[24:57.44]How's it going over there?
[24:59.93]I think nothing's happening.
[25:02.67]There's nothing happening, actually.
[25:03.85]Just a little cold.
[25:05.27]People are flying.
[25:05.87]I was in the airport yesterday.
[25:06.76]People were flying out, like, families.
[25:08.74]Like, it was packed.
[25:09.84]And there's nothing happening.
[25:11.11]Oh, shit.
[25:12.99]Oh, yeah, because last night you were like, oh, man, it could be bad, dude.
[25:18.16]We're going into this deep freeze.
[25:20.15]25 inches of snow or whatever it was and it just sunny day.
[25:24.50]They're just saying it's going to be as bad as last.
[25:26.45]Maybe it hasn't started yet.
[25:27.65]Maybe it hasn't started yet.
[25:29.64]Well, I wish you luck.
[25:31.56]Hopefully nothing out there.
[25:33.23]So if I DC, then it happened.
[25:35.42]How are you guys?
[25:36.13]What else is new?
[25:38.31]I'm okay.
[25:39.09]I've been sick for a while.
[25:40.57]I'm hoping this will end soon.
[25:42.46]It's been cold, so it's like 10 degrees here.
[25:47.10]I missed that.
[25:49.03]I'm okay.
[25:49.71]Same old.
[25:50.37]I'm actually going to go live now real quick, though, so I'll be back in just a minute.
[25:54.15]Oh, okay, cool.
[25:56.68]Yeah, I missed the cold.
[25:58.75]Okay, Poki, are you cold or hot?
[26:01.22]What's your preferred temperature for a climate?
[26:06.67]For what situation though?
[26:08.79]Like living.
[26:10.20]Just like living.
[26:10.84]Like where you live.
[26:14.72]Like a 70?
[26:18.94]Also, I love how you're asking if it was gaming.
[26:21.76]What is your ideal gaming temperature?
[26:23.85]Well, it depends.
[26:24.51]Gaming, I don't like to have cold hands.
[26:26.52]Okay.
[26:26.64]You know what I'm saying?
[26:27.22]I like to be a little chilly.
[26:28.63]Yeah.
[26:28.81]I don't like hot.
[26:29.61]I'd rather be freezing cold gaming than hot.
[26:32.04]Hot gaming sucks.
[26:33.57]Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[26:36.45]But I like like 69, 70, 70 Fahrenheit.
[26:40.22]Alright, but when you step outside, you open your front door.
[26:42.49]Oh, what a beautiful, great day it is today.
[26:45.68]I love this.
[26:47.20]Is it a little rainy?
[26:48.85]Is it...
[26:49.79]80, 90 degrees?
[26:50.94]Is it like 100 degrees?
[26:52.18]Is it chilly?
[26:53.15]Oh, I need a jacket.
[26:53.89]Is it snowy?
[26:55.64]Let me open that door up.
[26:56.49]Lightest wind ever that's a little cold, but it's like a t-shirt weather.
[27:01.95]OK.
[27:02.03]But it could be hoody.
[27:03.43]But once it becomes like 6 PM?
[27:05.62]Hoodie time, you know what I'm saying?
[27:07.91]Like a little bit of a hoodie time.
[27:09.22]So like LA weather.
[27:11.01]LA weather is perfect for me.
[27:12.59]Okay.
[27:14.42]Because mine goes either way.
[27:16.73]Because I actually, I'm figuring I may be a little bit strange.
[27:20.87]What is it?
[27:21.86]I like...
[27:23.63]It can be either one of these things.
[27:25.74]I either like it when you open that door and it is 110 degrees up.
[27:29.98]Fahrenheit.
[27:30.37]Really?
[27:31.03]And it's just like the world is just baking you and it's just you're in a tank top flip flops
[27:37.66]And it's just, everything is just hot.
[27:39.11]It's like the sun is beaming.
[27:40.77]And just like, you got an iced coffee in your hand.
[27:42.68]You're like, today is a fucking day.
[27:44.15]Let's go.
[27:45.39]hot as fuck outside, iced coffee in your hand.
[27:49.73]Awesome.
[27:50.15]Damn.
[27:51.26]Also, though... Jim, so you really like the 100 degrees days?
[27:54.30]I kind of do.
[27:55.33]It really depends, but I really do like it.
[27:57.70]But flip the other side.
[27:58.26]It's tough for me because I'm tubby, you know what I mean?
[27:59.81]So it's like extra to work with.
[28:02.64]Kind of nerfed out here.
[28:04.11]Yo, what is going on, everybody?
[28:05.93]So nice to see you.
[28:07.06]Been waiting forever for this.
[28:08.50]What is going on, everybody?
[28:09.49]Welcome, Ster, to the podcast.
[28:11.19]Hello.
[28:12.63]Yo, what is up, guys?
[28:16.14]Here's where we are in the conversation.
[28:18.79]Are you ready?
[28:19.90]Four of us.
[28:20.48]Alright, tell me.
[28:21.21]What is going on?
[28:21.83]Yeah, let's all everybody log into Deadlock real quick.
[28:24.62]Wait, what do we have fun on Deadlock?
[28:25.94]Four man?
[28:26.48]Aye.
[28:28.52]Would rather piss into a cup and drink it than do that.
[28:32.12]But you're in the game.
[28:33.84]You're the door guy.
[28:34.50]I'm just saying I would rather pee into a cup and then drink it on camera than play Deadlock for like an hour.
[28:39.97]Yeah, they made you the doorman and then you say you'd rather piss in a cup and drink it than play.
[28:47.49]Okay, I have nothing against the game.
[28:50.41]It actually did probably.
[28:53.12]I don't have a...
[28:54.50]I don't dislike the game.
[28:55.61]This is not out of anger of I think the game's bad.
[28:57.89]I just personally right now...
[29:00.40]I don't want to play deadlock.
[29:02.57]So I'm thinking of my priorities.
[29:04.44]What he's trying to say is that he actually drinks piss on the regular and it's not that big of a deal to him.
[29:11.34]I've seen him do it.
[29:12.86]He offered some to me.
[29:13.78]I don't want to play a MOBA.
[29:15.33]I just don't want to play a MOBA.
[29:17.08]It was like brown.
[29:18.50]Like dark orange.
[29:20.03]I needed to Gatorade that day.
[29:26.29]Damn.
[29:28.09]So we're doing crime?
[29:28.92]I think we're gonna play crime simulator.
[29:31.37]I'm very up right now.
[29:33.92]Crime is up?
[29:35.90]It's a simulator.
[29:41.07]So I think we can... Who wants to host?
[29:44.02]Ster!
[29:45.12]He always is our host.
[29:48.61]The host guy.
[29:51.14]We're going to Ster's house.
[29:53.31]I'll bring the jalapeño poppers.
[29:56.55]You don't need a license because we're coming to your house all the time.
[30:01.49]Hey, dude, I got invited to the party.
[30:03.74]Yeah, man, I brought a case of water.
[30:09.07]Dude, I'm drinking water right now.
[30:10.63]I brought a case of bottles of water, a 24-pack.
[30:16.91]You want me to put it?
[30:17.82]You got ice?
[30:19.40]You got ice going here?
[30:23.35]Hello?
[30:24.35]I don't drink, so I don't know.
[30:25.52]I don't know how to feel.
[30:28.51]What are you guys talking about?
[30:29.85]Alright, what are you actually bringing to the Super Bowl party, if we were to have one?
[30:34.33]Like, what are you bringing?
[30:35.96]Oh, oh, oh.
[30:38.85]Hi, can I bring cheese dip?
[30:42.96]Yeah, theoretical, hey, we're going to do the Super Bowl party, and everybody has to bring something.
[30:48.84]What are you going to bring?
[30:51.42]Egg salad or hummus.
[30:53.15]Okay.
[30:55.12]Cheese dip.
[30:56.51]Cheese.
[30:56.75]What kind of way?
[30:57.31]That's pretty vague.
[30:58.58]What would it be?
[30:59.55]What's a, what do you mean?
[31:02.20]I think like a hot cheese dip.
[31:04.72]I don't know, but I think maybe one...
[31:07.20]Are you making it or are you taking the can and dumping it into a tray and then bringing that?
[31:14.97]I'm going to make it from scratch.
[31:18.12]Okay.
[31:18.97]What's getting dippin' in it?
[31:21.04]I opened this game and I accidentally clicked like Spanish or something as my language.
[31:25.94]I don't even think it's something else.
[31:28.96]I just had to mute it now.
[31:30.50]I don't know how to change it.
[31:33.79]Can you, you have to delete your windows and then it'll delete the settings and you'll be alright.
[31:43.46]I would bring slow cooked pork ribs.
[31:46.13]Good answer.
[31:46.82]This music needs work.
[31:48.46]And then you would all, you all would like look bad.
[31:52.32]Yeah.
[31:53.17]Good answer.
[31:56.36]There's a tutorial.
[31:57.25]Did anyone do the tutorial?
[31:59.84]I did the tutorial.
[32:00.88]I did it.
[32:04.24]I was ready today.
[32:05.43]I was completely ready.
[32:07.93]I just got home a little while ago, so I'm unprepared.
[32:12.05]But if you can teach us as we go, that would be great.
[32:14.90]Alright.
[32:15.46]The tutorial was legitimately like, this is how you use a lockpick and this is how you sneak into a window.
[32:22.29]So it was very, it was very small stuff.
[32:25.03]Okay.
[32:25.97]Well, I've played Crime Simulator before in some capacity, so I think we got this.
[32:31.88]Who's doing the server?
[32:33.43]Ster, do you want to do a Spanish speaking server?
[32:37.08]I'm trying.
[32:37.66]It's Portuguese.
[32:38.77]I'm trying to figure out how to un-Portuguese my game.
[32:41.48]Okay.
[32:48.03]Who wants to do the server Jerm?
[32:51.60]You were saying, what were you talking about?
[32:53.29]Yeah, I could get it going.
[32:56.65]Okay.
[32:57.68]No, I do it.
[32:59.61]It's me.
[33:00.37]Well, I just did it.
[33:02.37]Oh, wait.
[33:02.68]Do we have to do the tutorial?
[33:04.68]Do you?
[33:05.08]It's pretty short, but I don't think you have to.
[33:10.66]Okay, I hope you don't have to.
[33:12.46]Let me invite you guys.
[33:13.45]I'm just doing a tutorial right now.
[33:14.29]I'm trying to figure it out.
[33:16.20]I should have invited you.
[33:16.94]I'm not normal.
[33:17.82]I'm doing a tutorial.
[33:19.25]Vinny, what's your name on Steam right now?
[33:23.51]I was offline.
[33:24.27]It should just be Vinesauce.
[33:26.96]Okay.
[33:28.83]There you are.
[33:31.36]So are we having a Super Bowl party?
[33:33.79]Okay, you should have all gotten an invitation.
[33:37.78]I'll bring Christmas crack.
[33:39.66]Should I do the tutorial?
[33:40.99]I'm still in this.
[33:41.75]You really don't need it.
[33:42.72]Okay, it's the same thing as...
[33:46.23]It's the same thing as kind of like Lethal Company where you have a quota.
[33:49.81]You need to steal a certain amount of items and make a certain amount of money.
[33:52.52]Did you invite me?
[33:55.19]I did.
[33:56.46]I'm serious.
[33:57.56]Why are you guys taller than me?
[33:59.15]Why am I short?
[34:01.31]I didn't get the Steam invite.
[34:03.54]Our eyes are in our neck.
[34:05.64]Oh.
[34:06.92]Yeah, my...
[34:09.27]I see neck to neck with you, Poke.
[34:18.01]arms.
[34:22.70]Can you punch with the left hand?
[34:23.78]I mean, right hand?
[34:24.77]I'm punching with both.
[34:28.19]I'll invite you again.
[34:33.26]This is so stupid.
[34:38.76]Oh man, alright.
[34:40.57]So we do have a couple other games, too.
[34:44.03]I want a crime for as long as we enjoy it, of course, but also I download that Misery game just in case we decide we want some slob jank.
[34:54.02]And have any of you played Hytale yet at all?
[34:59.43]I have not.
[35:00.44]But you said Hytale, and I said, oh, cool, Hytale.
[35:03.67]And I looked it up, and it's like its own standalone.
[35:06.04]I did not make an account.
[35:07.79]And you have to go get it from its website, right?
[35:11.02]It takes like five seconds, Grandpa.
[35:13.21]Do you need help?
[35:14.25]Not too bad.
[35:14.87]It's not too bad, I promise.
[35:15.88]But I'm saying I just, I don't have it.
[35:17.54]It's not like on Steam.
[35:18.39]I would have to like make the account and like get it.
[35:20.59]So it would be a few minutes.
[35:22.60]It would take some time.
[35:23.59]But I will tell you, I would love to play that game with you guys.
[35:27.18]If not now, then as it continues to be updated.
[35:30.65]because it's genuinely a fun game.
[35:33.65]It's a little bit feature incomplete at the moment because it's early access.
[35:37.77]and it had some trouble development, but they're doing a good job with it.
[35:41.19]And I think we would have a lot of fun exploring because it's, you know, that kind of game, so.
[35:46.40]Yeah, one day, if not today.
[35:49.45]one day if not today they're gonna throw it back to you oh look at this okay let's play right now
[35:58.26]Alright, Ster, are you in game?
[35:59.22]No, no, I wanna...
[36:00.29]I wanna crime.
[36:01.71]Ster, where are you?
[36:02.39]I joined your game, but there's no one here.
[36:04.82]Ster, what did you do?
[36:05.78]I'm in viz.
[36:09.26]Alright, are you actually in the game?
[36:11.52]How do we see a list of people in the game?
[36:18.48]Blood on the ground.
[36:20.93]I'm in offline mode?
[36:23.70]How the what?
[36:25.11]Fuck.
[36:28.03]You were leading.
[36:30.64]Kill me.
[36:31.13]Kill me.
[36:32.41]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:34.69]Lean forward.
[36:36.03]Lean forward.
[36:36.76]And you would, yeah.
[36:37.62]And let me just put you.
[36:40.15]You were trying to die.
[36:43.05]Hey guys.
[36:43.71]Why does the blood look like this?
[36:44.91]The leaning your face into the punches until you're dead is fucking crazy.
[36:48.45]Alright.
[36:48.81]Yeah, the blood is really good.
[36:50.34]You know what I think?
[36:51.87]The way we're all dressed is that I hope one day there's a fashion scene for Goon Corps.
[36:57.74]Like, I would wear this.
[36:59.91]What are you talking about?
[37:03.37]Oh, goons.
[37:04.99]Yeah, goons.
[37:05.35]Alright, we have- The board hasn't changed for me yet.
[37:07.42]We're doing some jobs!
[37:10.72]Okay, we can- Small neighborhood, rural street.
[37:14.15]Dude, we should have Dresden Press on the list.
[37:17.00]Jerma, I feel like we're gonna go bust ghosts.
[37:20.85]This is like... What's the game called?
[37:24.14]Phasmophobia, yeah.
[37:28.15]But only instead of ghosts, we're stealing jobs.
[37:30.88]Susan, we're here to rob you.
[37:33.11]We need to plant a package in the marked location.
[37:37.60]That is the job.
[37:38.59]We have three days to do it.
[37:41.43]That's an easy mission.
[37:43.22]Yeah.
[37:44.84]And now, also, we need to make...
[37:48.03]Okay, complete assignment without police involvement.
[37:52.27]There's item requests.
[37:54.22]and break, look, we're just gonna go still, okay?
[37:57.23]Stop killing each other.
[38:01.09]Alright, how much money we got?
[38:02.26]We should get a lockpick.
[38:03.82]Simple lockpick.
[38:06.78]Uh, maybe a crowbar?
[38:08.43]Is this like Phasmophobia?
[38:09.58]Are we stealing ghosts?
[38:11.37]Worst.
[38:16.05]Okay.
[38:17.78]Drone's gonna drop it.
[38:22.29]So we have now, we have a simple lockpick set.
[38:25.95]And who wants the lockpick?
[38:26.82]Who wants the crowbar?
[38:29.98]Please do not kill anybody.
[38:32.38]I want a lockpick.
[38:33.10]I want to break in.
[38:34.21]You take the lockpick.
[38:38.27]That swing is wide, by the way.
[38:41.54]I hope we get our health back when we join into a game.
[38:45.59]You know what I mean?
[38:46.11]Like when we're in a mission, because we're all.
[38:48.26]kill me?
[38:49.84]No.
[38:51.28]There's not going to be any danger on mission fucking one.
[38:54.61]Alright, let's go.
[38:55.33]How do you know?
[38:56.67]Because mission one is going to be like, oh, here's a fucking...
[39:01.27]It could be a Wraith or an Oni, dude.

[41:49.11]We have to not, we can't just like walk up to the person who lives at the house we're stealing from.
[41:55.86]We'll get into the swing of it.
[41:56.92]I know we'll lock in.
[41:57.89]These people are very fast at calling the police.
[42:00.66]And the police are very responsive in this neighborhood.
[42:03.57]Pet peeve, when people's Steam names isn't who they really are.

[43:03.79]We have to be careful.

[43:06.75]Yeah, I need another lockpick too.
[43:08.09]I mean, I think we only have like a few hundred bucks, dude.

[43:30.46]You need to know the tech.
[43:31.40]This wasn't in the tutorial.
[43:33.09]That's fine.
[43:33.61]But if you use it, it exploded last time.
[43:35.50]Are you serious?

[47:31.72]Do I have a big map?
[47:32.83]Do I have a big map?
[47:34.13]It's a fashion sense.
[47:35.74]Where the hell's the car?
[47:37.36]Ster said southeast.
[47:39.01]It's the home icon on the map.
[47:41.94]How do you get to the map?
[47:44.96]You have to keep going south.
[47:49.79]It says I'm not going anywhere and the cops are right behind you.
[47:53.40]I see it.
[47:54.93]Whoever's right behind me, just follow me.
[47:57.91]I just got shot.
[48:00.62]I dropped everything out there.
[48:03.80]What the hell just happened?
[48:05.44]I just tried to steal a cop car.
[48:09.07]Oh, out of Val's timer?
[48:11.18]I didn't even see it.
[48:12.74]Oh, you found... That's my shit.

[48:19.06]They're camping the van!
[48:20.39]Are you serious?
[48:21.21]Yeah, I was at the van.
[48:22.32]They're camping it.
[48:24.05]Come on.
[48:26.24]It's all up to you, Vinny.
[48:28.14]I'm in the shed.
[48:29.22]And I don't believe in you because I don't like you.
[48:31.24]were chasing you?
[48:32.06]Wait, I thought that was them on the mini map.
[48:33.85]That wasn't my friends.
[48:34.65]That was cop indicators, not friend indicator.
[48:37.66]Oh my God.
[48:38.18]That's why they were red.
[48:39.36]The red ones are enemies?
[48:40.87]What?
[48:41.23]Vinny, you're pushing your luck.
[48:44.28]She's about to call.
[48:45.46]Dude, right to the...
[48:46.43]Okay, to the right...
[48:47.81]There's a ton of shit that I dropped right to the right of the van.
[48:51.00]There's a painting.
[48:51.92]There's a ton of shit there.
[48:55.72]I think it's just you, Vinny.
[48:57.77]Okay, okay, okay.
[49:01.31]Just get in.
[49:01.91]Oh no.
[49:04.60]I don't know if I'm gonna be able to grab anyone's stuff.
[49:07.45]The sign in the back, you gotta click return to hideout and then you're good.
[49:11.79]Can I just drop this in here?
[49:13.54]No.
[49:13.78]Yeah, Vinny, right next to this van, like to the left.
[49:17.69]If you have an opportunity.
[49:18.84]Dude, they're gonna get you.
[49:20.95]Is it?
[49:21.31]Is it?
[49:21.72]Oh, yeah.
[49:22.04]No, no, no, no.
[49:22.84]Definitely.
[49:23.24]Wait, it's right there.
[49:24.49]Come on.
[49:25.49]It's right there.
[49:26.37]Yeah.
[49:28.32]Alright.
[49:28.82]Get in there quick.
[49:31.28]I was a doubter.
[49:34.46]Nice.
[49:35.98]Nice job, Vinny.
[49:38.59]Alright, get us back to home base.
[49:40.58]Was it just those two?
[49:41.71]It was just that, yeah.
[49:43.46]Alright.
[49:44.04]But it was a painting, though.
[49:44.88]That thing could be worth a lot.
[49:46.52]Sign all the way in the back.
[49:47.64]I dropped a lot of loot out there.
[49:50.09]Yeah, you should be able to go to the back panel.
[49:52.77]The sign all the way in the back.
[49:54.38]Oh, the sign.
[49:55.41]Alright.
[49:55.91]Return to high.
[49:56.47]I understand.
[49:57.22]Okay.
[50:00.42]Nice job.
[50:02.99]This crowbar is almost dead.
[50:06.83]How did you use all this crowbar?
[50:10.93]I just hid it in their fence.
[50:13.13]That is a good idea.
[50:15.61]We got eight out of 180 loot.
[50:17.08]Tony said you stole an Etsy painting and a Costco member card.
[50:21.85]Oh, is that?
[50:22.64]Okay.
[50:22.98]Well, let's take a look.
[50:24.30]What was it worth?
[50:25.15]$40.
[50:27.09]Oh no.
[50:29.15]I'm drinking.
[50:31.08]Alright, what's a painting worth?
[50:34.78]The painting was like a hundred bucks.
[50:37.18]I got a nice gin.
[50:40.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[50:41.31]Before we do that, don't press that button.
[50:42.84]Is anything on the list here?
[50:44.92]Because there's specific items in the item requests.
[50:48.31]Vacuum cleaner.
[50:49.78]Okay, hold on.
[50:50.22]Let's see.
[50:52.96]Art.
[50:54.57]Okay, brick red and white abstract painting.
[50:58.24]Is that it?
[50:58.68]I think we got that.
[50:59.42]Is that the right one?
[51:00.20]Yeah.
[51:00.95]Oh, shit.
[51:01.41]Let me see it.
[51:03.03]Because that's worth more, I think, if we do the, uh...
[51:05.78]I need to see what you sell.
[51:06.57]I did not do the tutorial.
[51:08.13]You sell by... Oh God, I'm stuck in the box.
[51:15.53]We need zip ties, man.
[51:16.73]Okay, if you... Yeah, just unstuck me.
[51:22.91]Both floating.
[51:25.12]It looks so terrible.
[51:27.97]Are you dying?
[51:28.63]No.
[51:29.66]Can you even hurt me?
[51:31.28]No, your gun...
[51:34.77]One of those hit.
[51:39.83]Alright, I'm almost there.
[51:40.80]Couple more.
[51:42.57]You think my blood's worth anything?
[51:46.55]Wait, am I punching you, Poke?
[51:49.21]It went through Jerma, and I punched Poke.
[51:52.43]I can't get out of here.
[51:54.25]We gotta kill both of you now.
[51:57.42]Just sell us both.
[51:59.27]There's an unstuck button somewhere.
[52:00.91]I was pressing earlier.
[52:02.77]I want to see if you can sell me.
[52:04.05]If you click the sell button, whatever.
[52:05.22]How about Ster your Ster now?
[52:08.64]One more punch and I'm dead.
[52:10.19]Alright, now sell me.
[52:14.90]Not worth anything.
[52:17.55]Did you bring, uh, did you bring the other thing?
[52:20.10]Alright, here we go.
[52:21.93]We didn't saw the painting.
[52:23.01]I think we have to do something.
[52:23.87]Let me go to the computer with the painting.
[52:25.44]What?
[52:30.07]Alright, maybe this is not- how do I- how do you actually put it in here?
[52:35.13]He's priceless.
[52:36.16]It's the wrong painting, then.
[52:38.87]You're priceless, dude.
[52:42.21]That's the sign of a true friend.
[52:45.65]Am I muted?
[52:46.21]Two of them?
[52:46.83]No, you're both good.
[52:48.59]I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[52:51.85]Oh, shit.
[52:52.41]Well, you need both of them.
[52:54.63]Oh, okay.
[52:55.09]We need a second.
[52:55.79]We need green and blue shapes painting as well.
[53:00.50]So don't sell this yet.
[53:01.62]Yeah, let's just like place it.
[53:06.25]No, no, no, dude, no, scroll down.
[53:07.94]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[53:10.00]Hoke, where were you?
[53:11.59]I'm here.
[53:12.04]I don't know where you were two days ago.
[53:15.58]Oh, uh, business.
[53:17.53]Can you talk about that?
[53:18.44]Business?
[53:19.68]No.
[53:20.59]Alright.
[53:22.34]So I'm going to just leave it.
[53:24.59]All will be revealed.
[53:26.52]Okay, so how are we doing on items?
[53:28.58]Do you see how it works now?
[53:30.73]Can I understand how it works?
[53:32.39]I have a crowbar.
[53:33.29]I like it.
[53:36.42]How about a lockpick?
[53:39.51]Do we still have one of those?
[53:40.86]That's gone, right?
[53:42.16]I have no luck.
[53:43.17]We have no money in there.
[53:44.33]Oh, fuck, we have $10.
[53:44.94]Alright, well, we have to steal something.
[53:46.22]This is your voice acting thing?
[53:47.89]Wait, I voiced something in this?
[53:50.02]You did?
[53:51.33]I don't know.
[53:52.33]Oh shit, really?
[53:54.08]No, I don't think so.
[53:55.27]Did I?
[53:56.19]Let's find out.
[53:57.35]The punch sound.
[53:59.51]Who's got the crowbar?
[54:01.77]We have nothing.
[54:02.78]We're leaving.
[54:03.83]I thought then you had the crowbar we're leaving I saw you holding it I have it's got one hit if you throw it it instant knocked out the guy
[54:12.32]He does wake up.
[54:14.97]Okay.
[54:16.16]Alright, so one other thing, too.
[54:17.81]If you see a magazine on the ground in somebody's house, it could be a skill leaflet.
[54:23.86]And we want to pick those up.
[54:27.37]Wait, do you guys see the last thing it said?
[54:30.04]Random reward box if we get a 7,500.
[54:32.62]We got to do that.
[54:34.42]We need that.
[54:36.79]Yeah.
[54:36.99]But if you see, if you see a magazine on the, it's like, Oh, a skill point.
[54:40.66]Yeah.
[54:41.02]That's how you acquire skills.
[54:43.07]What seems to be the officer problem.
[54:47.59]Alright, just be, don't be suspicious.
[54:48.79]We could steal the car.
[54:50.44]Maybe.
[54:52.37]I think we might need some tools for that.
[54:54.24]Special tools.
[54:56.33]simple lockpick set for this big house.
[54:58.42]I'm going to go for the small house.
[54:59.90]Oh, God.
[55:03.98]What do you mean the police have been alerted?
[55:05.26]What happened?
[55:06.72]Does it mean?
[55:07.31]I don't wanna talk about it.
[55:09.42]Ster.
[55:10.25]I opened the door and it just, they have a camera and it instantly went off and I didn't know.
[55:14.18]Alright, Vinny, let's try the back.
[55:15.77]We've been detected.
[55:16.47]We've been detected at that house.
[55:19.75]Oh, God, alarm system.
[55:21.61]Steal the gnome.
[55:22.54]Steal the gnome.
[55:23.44]I'm running this way.
[55:24.28]I'm getting out of here.
[55:26.91]I can't steal the gnome, and I can't get out of here.
[55:30.31]They're all coming.
[55:31.50]I say we just restart.
[55:33.17]Well, now that we understand how the game works, let's see what ends up here.
[55:36.82]Prime doesn't pay, guys.
[55:38.80]Okay, you need agility level one to climb a fence.
[55:45.31]Damn!
[55:47.77]Oh.
[55:48.69]That worked.
[55:49.82]I can't jump over this?
[55:59.30]Yeah, let's hit him with the restart.
[56:01.31]Wait, I'm gonna steal this person's toilet.
[56:07.30]Can you?
[56:08.87]Dude, I just got 50 bucks.
[56:11.93]This person's money is sitting around like cash is sitting around.
[56:13.41]Wait, take the police car.
[56:14.64]Take the police car.
[56:16.75]You can't.
[56:18.12]Vinny tried to do it.
[56:19.14]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[56:21.25]Damn.
[56:23.14]Damn.
[56:23.60]I wish.
[56:24.81]Oh, fuck.
[56:30.07]Dude, the police are not on me.
[56:32.22]I can do stuff.
[56:33.80]Yeah, I'm good too, actually.
[56:35.23]Oh my god, I just took the literal Eiffel Tower from this person's house.
[56:40.36]You're Eiffel Towering him?
[56:41.89]What?
[56:42.35]Oh, my God.
[56:43.55]I'm doing well.
[56:44.31]That's all I got to tell you.
[56:46.10]Where are you?
[56:47.00]Me and you are out of here.
[56:49.27]Come on.
[56:57.37]Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[57:00.40]I got a toaster.
[57:02.15]Jerma, Jerma.
[57:03.76]I'm like kind of near the telephone.
[57:07.56]There's a blue telephone that I'm near.
[57:09.76]I see you now.
[57:10.99]I think I have...
[57:11.77]I don't think I can carry anything else.
[57:13.86]Not high enough level to use the phone yet, mom.
[57:16.75]This person lives here?
[57:18.30]You're being chased by a police officer.
[57:20.89]Like the instant he saw me, he was like, oh, I know that guy.
[57:23.60]He's a criminal.
[57:24.29]Dude, 0123 is this person's password.
[57:26.78]I don't know what the safe is, but I got to get out of here.
[57:31.27]I'm getting fucking profiled.
[57:32.90]I think that's the Chrysler building you're holding.
[57:35.53]You got in the garbage can and you vaulted over.
[57:37.22]Alright.
[57:41.09]Oh, no.
[57:42.20]Uh-oh.
[57:44.07]Yeah, there's no jumping that way.
[57:45.70]The swing set.
[57:49.36]Over there!
[57:50.01]Can I get on that?
[57:50.55]Dude, you brought the cops over here!
[57:52.15]You did!
[57:55.25]Aw, man!
[57:55.81]You brought the police over!
[57:57.04]You were being chased by an officer!
[57:59.59]The person in the house saw you.
[58:03.36]Oh man.
[58:06.07]We got it now.
[58:06.85]Here's what we're gonna do.
[58:07.47]We're not gonna punch anybody in the fucking hideout.
[58:10.43]We're gonna buy lockpicks.
[58:11.75]Restart the whole game.
[58:12.76]We're gonna be careful.
[58:13.84]We're gonna be careful.
[58:15.79]Last day to complete your quota.
[58:17.65]Oh, we do have one more day, but is it worth it?
[58:20.14]We have no items or anything.
[58:21.37]We have no items.
[58:22.65]Let's just reset the game.
[58:24.85]Actually, you know what?
[58:26.96]Let's keep this going because we probably can fail and just... Let's get our bearings again.
[58:31.72]It's good to get one more in.
[58:33.04]Are there skill upgrades?
[58:34.71]There are.
[58:35.07]You find them by- they're little magazines that are in people's houses.
[58:40.13]And it's the only way.
[58:44.70]Oh, wait.
[58:45.34]We actually just lose.
[58:47.35]Okay, so let's just go lose.
[58:49.41]Yeah, let's go lose.
[58:51.50]Because I see we're doing, like, Battle Royale.
[58:54.40]This game really is a microcosm of civilization.
[59:03.58]Dude this looks like a horror movie ground.
[59:10.53]This looks like the ground in a horror game.
[59:14.55]We just fired a gun.
[59:15.39]Wait, how'd you die?
[59:17.92]I don't... Whoa, sniper, what the fuck?
[59:21.35]What's happening?
[59:24.36]Oh.
[59:24.40]They just, like, snipe us one at a time if we fail.
[59:29.02]This is insane.
[59:29.60]Alright, we can go again.
[59:33.94]I feel good about this run.
[59:35.14]Okay, I'm not punching anyone in the lobby, and I know it's funny.
[59:38.11]We did the funny bit.
[59:39.32]It's great.
[59:41.87]It's not funny.
[59:42.87]It's necessary.
[59:44.40]So there's no... Because we've had the police alerted on Rural Street the whole game.
[59:49.75]So now that we don't...
[59:51.22]here's what I here's what I'm going to say we should split off into twos because all four of us going into one house is just a mess and it's a good
[59:59.77]Oh, I just found the lady.
[60:00.76]Oh my God, I ran into her.
[60:02.41]Let's do twos.
[60:02.99]Well, then we're all going to be...
[60:04.00]The comms are going to be...
[60:06.19]You know, it's going to be all over the place.
[60:07.81]Light comms.
[60:09.00]Very light, calm comms.
[60:10.71]No, I believe here is a strat.
[60:14.08]I have the crowbar.
[60:15.45]Same strat.
[60:16.26]I'm gonna throw it.
[60:16.88]They're gonna get knocked out.
[60:17.88]We loot the house.
[60:18.99]We know they're gonna wake up.
[60:19.76]Then we get out.
[60:20.26]I think violence is not the immediate answer.
[60:22.63]I think we can sneak into people's houses.
[60:25.12]Where's Poke?
[60:26.38]Have you played the previous versions of this game, anyone?
[60:30.15]Did you invite Pope?
[60:31.73]I didn't get an invite.
[60:32.52]I'll invite you.
[60:34.36]The game didn't change for us.
[60:36.53]Have either of you guys played the previous crime simulators?
[60:40.36]No.
[60:41.22]No.
[60:42.39]I think I did.
[60:42.79]They're pretty good.
[60:43.67]They're pretty good.
[60:45.00]I played the simulator.
[60:47.55]Yeah, it's similar.
[60:49.19]But yeah, this is like a series.
[60:51.10]I guess this is the latest, but yeah, it's not bad.
[60:56.76]And you just graduate to better equipment, and then eventually you start robbing mansions.
[61:03.82]It's fun.
[61:06.06]Alright, so let's... Did you just die?
[61:10.23]Why are you dying?
[61:12.16]How did that happen?
[61:13.15]I don't want to talk about it.
[61:16.37]No, genuinely, what happened there?
[61:18.07]You sniped?
[61:19.26]I jumped the fence and tried to use the truck's car door, and then the guy said, you can't leave like that, and I got shot in the head.
[61:26.00]There.
[61:27.03]Don't do that.
[61:28.74]I won't do that.
[61:29.96]Guys, I think I should buy a simple lockpick.
[61:32.59]What do we think about that?
[61:33.52]We should get at least one of those.
[61:35.49]The idea is fantastic.
[61:36.95]Hello there.
[61:42.95]I think we might need one more simple lockpick if we have any money.
[61:45.50]Do we have any money?
[61:46.09]300.
[61:47.38]should have someone okay we should get so if we're doing twos we need at least two lock picks in my humble opinion
[61:55.43]What about Banana?
[61:56.22]Should we get Banana?
[61:57.16]Whose team do you want to be on, Vinny?
[61:59.79]I'll be on yours, sir.
[62:02.70]To subvert expectations.
[62:05.15]I doubt that.
[62:07.56]Yeah.
[62:09.06]Alright, Polk, do you have a lost pet corner with that one?
[62:11.59]We got to go to the Hoover Dam together.
[62:13.14]We can do this.
[62:17.79]Let's go.
[62:18.26]Alright.
[62:19.93]Got it.
[62:20.24]Ready?
[62:20.70]One more simple lockpick.
[62:21.93]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[62:25.91]So now we have two simple lockpicks amongst... Alright.
[62:31.94]We got two simple lockpicks, so Poke, you got one.
[62:34.18]Ster, have any of you guys got one?
[62:36.83]No.
[62:38.68]It just got delivered.
[62:39.62]Vinny should have it.
[62:41.23]I'm ready.
[62:41.69]I got one.
[62:42.51]Alright.
[62:42.73]You guys ready?
[62:43.97]I'm ready.
[62:45.13]Give me one second.
[62:46.96]Give me one second, please.
[62:48.14]Please, please, please, please, please give me one second, please.
[62:55.12]Stirrup.
[63:02.94]You good?
[63:05.52]Can I get a second that it's been multiple of variety of seconds?
[63:12.56]OK, let's go fine.
[63:16.27]Were you practicing the stethoscope?
[63:21.21]How's the weather in- How's the weather in Vegas, Jerm?
[63:24.82]It's pretty chilly.
[63:25.37]It's nice though.
[63:27.34]Lucky.
[63:28.68]Usually drops to about 40, 38 to 40 during the winter.
[63:32.67]It's nice.
[63:33.17]I like it like that.

[63:48.32]Alright, what are you guys getting?
[63:50.57]What are you guys getting?
[63:52.34]Let's go.
[63:53.29]Like a slight wind?
[63:55.02]What's your...
[63:56.31]It doesn't shut down your whole power grid when there's a fucking wind.
[63:58.94]Alright, there's a package right here.
[64:00.85]My power was off last night for 10 minutes.
[64:03.36]We're not doing anything criminal.
[64:05.83]So, but that package as a bonus can be delivered into this person's house.
[64:10.30]This person is in there.
[64:11.57]They are in there right now.
[64:13.88]Alright, so where are you?

[64:17.01]Alright, you've already, the cops have been called.
[64:19.95]And Poke, come with me.
[64:21.52]We have nothing to do with this.

[64:22.87]He was fucking invisible.
[64:24.06]Okay.
[64:25.76]Poke, just come over here.
[64:26.46]Well, let's just stand over here because we didn't do any of this.
[64:28.73]Let's just get the... Yeah.

[66:01.30]No, I had to plant the thing and then run from the cops.
[66:05.39]Okay, Pope, do you think that window right in front of us is openable?
[66:09.83]Yeah, I'll try.
[66:10.75]Give it a try.

[68:25.94]Okay, I'm hidden right now.
[68:27.97]I'm just going to hide in this bush.
[68:31.74]Because right now I'm completely hidden.
[68:35.34]I'm going to lose these stars right now.
[68:43.12]Oh, fuck, there they are.
[68:43.98]Holy shit.
[68:45.09]I got to sneak over here.
[68:46.69]Oh, you're good.
[68:47.08]You're good.
[68:47.44]Just go.
[68:47.82]Turn around now.
[68:49.39]The cops are right there?
[68:50.43]Okay.
[68:50.79]They're moving?
[68:52.33]Yeah, you're good.
[68:52.79]You're good.
[68:54.60]You can run it.
[68:55.79]You want to run?
[68:56.92]You can run it.
[68:58.16]I promise.
[68:58.79]I promise you you can run it.
[69:00.30]Dude, I'm going back into the fucking territory.
[69:02.27]Yeah, it's out there to your left.
[69:09.16]I see it.
[69:10.32]Yeah, let's go.
[69:11.73]Hell yeah.
[69:14.16]Dude, we got a laptop.
[69:19.18]There's a lockpick in there, I'm pretty sure, on the floor.
[69:23.56]Okay, good job.
[69:24.35]I can come back later.
[69:26.76]Dude, I got somebody's smartphone.
[69:29.15]Jerma, check this shit out.
[69:30.10]Look how much stuff I got.
[69:31.42]What'd you get?
[69:40.09]Why would you throw it at me?
[69:41.49]I don't know, because that would be funny.
[69:43.28]Here, take this.
[69:44.19]You're like the strong guy, right?
[69:47.92]I guess I think if you use that you'll get a skill point.
[69:52.07]Strong.
[69:53.84]You have no skill points.
[69:55.14]It says when I try to use it.
[69:56.59]Really?
[69:57.21]We'll just keep it here.
[69:57.90]We can bring it back.
[69:58.52]Alright.
[69:58.76]So should we just close it up now or do you want to try to get something else?
[70:03.10]That laptop's got to be worth at least like 500 bucks.
[70:06.78]It says when you put it down.
[70:07.81]370.
[70:11.83]Okay.
[70:13.39]Also, I don't think we push the lock here.
[70:15.02]Take a rock.
[70:17.57]You throw things at the cameras, they break.
[70:19.91]Alright.
[70:21.40]Here, Jerma.
[70:21.90]Here, come with me.
[70:22.68]I knew.
[70:22.95]We're going to do a... No, no, no.
[70:23.95]This is a bad idea.
[70:24.83]No, yes, yes, yes.
[70:25.84]This is a terrible idea because we have like $600, $700 worth of stuff.
[70:29.65]We almost have to quote it already.
[70:30.87]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[70:31.74]Trust me.
[70:32.20]Trust God.
[70:33.12]I don't know if I like this idea.
[70:34.83]Do you see this lady?
[70:35.81]I do, I see this lady.
[70:37.31]Yes, I do.
[70:39.50]Okay, you just, whatever you did, you threw a can at her.
[70:41.97]Okay, you just threw a rock at her.
[70:42.94]Alright, alright, alright!
[70:45.85]Wait!
[70:47.23]Dude, you didn't- What the fuck?!
[70:51.03]I got her smartphone!
[70:54.79]I can't break a window of the rock?
[70:56.98]Oh my god.
[70:58.20]She's waking up.
[70:58.86]She's waking up.
[70:59.55]In three, two, one.
[71:02.24]I missed.
[71:02.74]I missed.
[71:03.32]I missed.
[71:03.69]I missed.
[71:07.55]She's following you!
[71:08.61]She's so fast!
[71:09.42]She's right behind you!
[71:11.50]She's right behind you!
[71:12.41]Get us out!
[71:19.13]The cops are here, dude!
[71:20.31]Is it- we getting out?
[71:24.21]Oh my god.
[71:24.73]Yeah.
[71:24.95]Oh my god.
[71:25.31]Jesus.
[71:26.70]How rich are we?
[71:27.66]Nine dollars?
[71:28.91]I've got a bonus of nine holes.
[71:30.14]It's only the bonus.
[71:31.00]Yeah.
[71:31.87]If you do really well, then yeah, maybe you get more, but we're not doing really well.
[71:36.93]We checked the that laptop might be something
[71:46.23]no key smartphone okay home router and a home audio system is worth a lot do you want the rock how do you see the price of it
[71:55.15]If you go to the computer.
[71:55.86]When you drop it in here, it shows the price on the right side of the screen.
[71:59.19]Also, don't sell the router.
[72:00.74]Well, not right now.
[72:01.40]Only when we were in the area.
[72:03.76]Uh, do not sell the router, because if we get...
[72:08.45]Okay.
[72:08.76]A... Do I sell the laptop?
[72:12.95]Uh, let's see.
[72:15.03]router is right here.
[72:18.38]I don't see the laptop on here.
[72:22.38]I saw the router.
[72:23.16]Where is it now?
[72:25.07]It's on the floor.
[72:26.00]It's over here.
[72:26.83]Wallet.
[72:33.73]Okay, if we keep that wallet and we get a black leather wallet, we can turn them both in for $7.50.
[72:38.57]Yeah, if you go to the item request and you can see.
[72:42.07]If something has a blue link, it means we have it and we need something else for it.
[72:46.44]Everyone wants my rock?
[72:49.93]We should keep the wallet out because if we find a black leather wallet, then we can get the double bonus.
[72:56.50]Well, that's kind of cool.
[72:57.40]I like that.
[72:57.80]You want my rock?
[72:59.07]I don't want your rock.
[73:00.23]Hey, guys, I don't know if I'm buying a lockpick.
[73:05.32]yeah we well we might need two as usual because without lockpick we we cannot get in alright let's sell this I only need rock
[73:14.86]Alright, we just got 500 bucks.
[73:17.37]We only need a couple hundred more.
[73:18.38]Not bad, not bad.
[73:24.58]No, no, now it's not?
[73:25.72]Oh, okay.
[73:26.55]Jesus.
[73:27.25]I thought you were...
[73:29.66]I thought you were, like, beating the shit out of Ster or something.
[73:33.94]working okay so this is we kind of are in trouble but we don't we'll be only a little bit we only need a little bit of stuff
[73:44.02]Alright, one lockpick it is.
[73:45.95]I was still a Dyson.
[73:48.85]That shit's good money.
[73:52.10]I'm ready.
[73:52.96]You guys have a Dyson?
[73:54.53]I want to steal a turtle.
[73:55.62]A Dyson ball?
[73:57.72]A Dyson, uh, vacuum?
[73:59.91]I like them.
[74:00.19]I don't, but I have a standing... What are those vacuums that look skinny?
[74:04.42]I have a mouth.
[74:05.85]You guys good?
[74:10.29]I'm starting.
[74:11.29]I'm sorry, what are you- what, you just suck the fucking grossness off your floor?
[74:15.77]Is that what you're telling me?
[74:16.75]You're playing Kirby.
[74:18.32]Yeah.
[74:18.48]Don't even.
[74:19.10]Okay, nice pivot.
[74:21.92]That makes it okay.
[74:23.55]If Kirby sucks dirt through his throat, then that makes it okay for you?
[74:28.38]Every time I hear the word Dyson, I just think of Peter Molyneux.
[74:32.64]I don't know why.
[74:35.18]This game will change the reality of humanity.
[74:38.45]You see the ball, the Dyson ball, the engineering of it, it can swivel around your furniture.
[74:44.09]That'll be $1,400, please.
[74:48.12]is really life-changing mechanics in this game.
[74:52.02]How much is like a big Dyson, like a Dyson vacuum cleaner, like a big one?
[74:56.71]Guys, watch out.
[74:57.68]That lady's always home.
[74:58.56]I think they have big ones.
[75:00.17]I've got her door key.
[75:01.63]It doesn't matter.
[75:04.80]fable will be the number one game alright we got we're the there's a police officer here is this lady home
[75:12.74]Simple lockpick, simple lockpick right here.
[75:18.00]Who's got one?
[75:19.28]I don't have one.
[75:20.79]I'm coming.
[75:24.71]Oh my god, those noises are really scaring me.
[75:28.71]I can't pick- Oh, I found 20 books!
[75:32.39]Oh, she's in the bathroom!
[75:34.75]Oh, we gotta get out.
[75:37.18]Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[75:39.87]What?
[75:40.46]How did a cop instantly appear?
[75:43.25]That's how it works.
[75:45.40]We should have enough to end it.
[75:50.84]I'm being chased.
[75:51.74]It's over.
[75:54.61]Vinny, did you get any items?
[75:55.80]Because if you did, we should be fine.
[75:56.82]I got one.
[75:58.00]I got one and two.
[76:00.03]I got two.
[76:00.45]Should I leave?
[76:01.12]Should I just leave?
[76:01.84]Yeah, get out.
[76:02.32]No.
[76:04.03]No, what about me?
[76:05.36]You have 10 seconds.
[76:06.89]Are you live still?
[76:07.74]Are you live?
[76:08.18]Wait, what the fuck?
[76:09.65]Alright, I'm canceling.
[76:11.50]Yeah, are you lethal?
[76:13.59]You got so many people following you folk.
[76:16.58]I don't think you're going to get out of this.
[76:19.59]What the fuck?
[76:20.79]I think you should just leave.
[76:23.06]I think you should just leave.
[76:27.42]oh my god did I just lose everything yeah I did alright we should have enough money
[76:40.07]Oh, no, I still have it.
[76:41.64]I kept everything I had.
[76:43.63]That's kind of a pro strat.
[76:45.72]Oh, shit.
[76:46.82]I got a portable scanner and a toaster.
[76:48.82]Are either of these part of a combo item set?
[76:51.61]take a look at the uh item list wait appliances in the car and then everyone goes steal and then
[76:58.42]On the computer, there's the purple item requests, and let's see.
[77:02.31]Let's just have Vinny stay in the car.
[77:04.50]Alright, slow cooker, we apparently have.
[77:07.95]We need a slow cooker and a gas canister to do that together.
[77:11.59]Oh, I have the slow cooker.
[77:12.98]I have a toaster and a portable scanner and the toaster's like worth 200 for some reason.
[77:20.91]Should buy another lockpick.
[77:24.57]I don't see anything else there.
[77:27.31]We made quota, fellas.
[77:29.25]Cool.
[77:36.50]So I don't think it... Oh my god, I almost just got killed.
[77:39.76]I don't think if we do more, I don't think it adds to the next day.
[77:45.51]I think it gives you extra experience credits or something.
[77:49.73]I think maybe more money.
[77:51.13]I don't think it adds to the quota for the next time.
[77:53.48]Okay.
[77:54.74]So we just get more money to buy crap.
[77:56.99]I think so, yeah.
[77:59.10]Okay.
[78:00.76]I think we need money, though.
[78:01.83]We probably should sell some stuff, yeah.
[78:07.94]Can we just hide the items for the next round, or does it go away?
[78:11.30]That's a good question.
[78:12.83]I imagine they'd probably stay.
[78:17.16]But we should be trying to complete sets, apparently.
[78:22.50]I'm ready.
[78:24.44]Ready.
[78:24.75]I am also ready.
[78:26.47]let us begin so we just have to kind of just stay alive don't just to wait what about jobs anything new
[78:34.97]No, we have to be level two.
[78:37.89]Alright, let's just go.
[78:38.49]Yeah, and I don't have enough experience points to read the muscle magazine.
[78:44.07]Yeah, that's a skill you can get like muscles one something
[78:51.38]start this game has got to change life you know we was working on it for a couple years
[78:57.40]At the studio furniture for our base when we are thieves I
[79:06.21]I want to buy furniture.
[79:07.56]Just buy bean bags and a hot plate.
[79:10.36]Cook beans on a hot plate.
[79:11.74]Let's go to this place.
[79:12.85]There's one guy walking around it.
[79:15.23]There's just a camera.
[79:17.28]He has a bunch of rooms.
[79:19.01]And look, this camera is shit.
[79:21.62]Okay.
[79:25.98]Security level increased.
[79:28.15]Can we take the camera?
[79:29.99]You just watch out because there's one guy that walks around here.
[79:36.21]Can you throw more rocks at him?
[79:38.95]What do we think?
[79:41.42]His garage always has tons of shit in it.
[79:43.85]I just found $100 and a smartphone.
[79:46.64]I got a smartphone.
[79:48.13]Hell yeah.
[79:49.41]Alright.
[79:49.79]Okay, the guy is in this right now.
[79:52.24]He's in his garage.
[79:55.01]He's just sitting there.
[79:56.58]No one has a glass knife, right?
[79:58.35]Um, no.
[79:58.85]Probably not.
[80:00.60]Eyes out loud?
[80:01.40]I don't...
[80:01.86]Wait, yo, you were heard.
[80:03.13]He's coming.

[80:04.72]He's coming.
[80:05.50]Hide, hide, hide.
[80:08.65]Get everything you can?
[80:09.27]He's suspicious, but I don't think he knows we're here yet.
[80:12.47]What do you mean, I triggered a trap?
[80:14.02]This guy has fucking traps in his house!
[80:17.52]Um... Oh, he killed you.
[80:22.77]Yeah, what, did the guy put, like, RC cars all over the ground and I tripped on them?
[80:27.60]Yeah.
[80:28.40]There's a paint bucket on the stairs too.
[80:32.28]He's coming to get you guys.
[80:43.93]With large items, you have to throw them through the window first before you can take them out the window.
[80:50.15]So, shit.
[80:56.84]Hello?
[80:57.87]How'd I get out of here?
[81:02.95]Oh, is he coming in?
[81:06.97]He just tried to kick you.
[81:08.84]Oh.
[81:11.02]Caught right behind you.
[81:16.40]Cop going into the van.
[81:18.29]Cop coming into the van right now.
[81:22.11]Oh my god, you actually might be alright.
[81:27.89]How do I leave?
[81:28.46]How do I leave or return to hideout?
[81:30.01]Yep.
[81:32.79]You're going to make Ster very angry with that.
[81:34.91]No, no, no.
[81:36.00]He's good.
[81:37.73]I mean, you can.
[81:38.35]I don't have anything.
[81:39.69]I could grab some shit real quick.
[81:41.88]Oh my god, no, just leave.
[81:43.15]Just leave.
[81:43.53]I can't just leave now.
[81:44.87]I just can't... Oh my god.
[81:47.46]Watch this.
[81:48.07]Ster, you have to head to the... You have to head to the...
[81:51.04]The truck.
[81:51.45]You got to go to the truck, sir.
[81:53.53]Why can't Polk do it?
[81:55.18]Because the cops are in the van.
[81:56.83]Well, then what difference does it make if I go?
[82:00.41]Because then you can save the run.
[82:01.92]I hit it, though.
[82:03.15]The bars work?
[82:04.39]I think.
[82:06.18]I don't know.
[82:06.46]Oh, this is too funny.
[82:08.56]Did we do it?
[82:09.50]How'd that work?
[82:14.53]Oh, that was so funny, Polk.
[82:15.79]Just watching you run around in a circle.
[82:18.80]Save it.
[82:19.31]Do we keep the items?
[82:21.11]It's all there.
[82:21.65]It's all there.
[82:22.56]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[82:23.58]You have to keep it.
[82:24.28]I got another strong man.
[82:27.33]Oh, well, that's nice.
[82:29.40]We still have no money for lockpicks.
[82:33.44]I have one.
[82:35.22]Oh.
[82:35.34]I can't buy it.
[82:38.31]OK, everything is kind of maybe we get paid when we meet the quota.
[82:42.30]It says our cuts 25%.
[82:42.95]Oh, I don't know.
[82:45.58]Maybe whatever is left over.
[82:49.99]Vacuum cleaner times two value for that.
[82:54.06]Only the host can finalize the delivery.
[82:56.98]Am I finalizing?
[82:58.32]Are we good?
[82:59.47]I think we are, right?
[83:02.83]Only the host can do it.
[83:04.36]I'm doing it.
[83:07.51]Wow, we got 25% of it.
[83:09.85]Hell yeah.
[83:10.31]Alright, we need 2,500 bucks.
[83:14.13]Alright.
[83:16.03]We got a good amount of stuff.
[83:18.95]Now, will this stuff turn into different combos later is the question.
[83:23.83]Possible.
[83:24.81]Let's see.
[83:26.16]We will see.
[83:26.74]Do we need Q smartphone?
[83:28.21]Oh.
[83:28.43]Three smartphones.
[83:30.16]I use a strong man.
[83:32.27]Oh, good, good, good.
[83:33.23]That means you're strong plus now.
[83:35.52]You have a point in strength.
[83:37.34]I have more inventory space.
[83:42.63]We also can pay to unlock something else.
[83:47.04]Like real money?
[83:48.90]We could also do a heist right now.
[83:50.55]We could do the Texas train station.
[83:53.20]do it I don't I don't think we understand how anything works I don't think we're ready for a heist yeah we we need more tools too I think going in without any tools is going to be a problem
[84:02.64]It's also $1,500 to unlock the next town area.
[84:07.63]Yeah, we got to start small, see?
[84:09.74]I'll buy a glass knife.
[84:13.02]Yeah, we should go in with some items.
[84:15.85]You don't have to throw a brick through the windows
[84:23.51]You think the knife will be quiet on a window?
[84:26.82]The glass knife, yeah, it's quiet.
[84:29.77]Yeah, I use them all the time.
[84:34.07]Let me see.
[84:34.76]When you lock yourself out.
[84:37.35]What about a Bobby pin?
[84:41.11]Yeah, I saw that you need level two lockpicking or something for that, like agility.
[84:46.29]I saw it earlier.
[84:48.28]It was weird.
[84:49.18]What a blowtorch.
[84:52.18]That's how I sounded the past month.
[84:53.95]Whoever did that noise, that's me.
[84:57.10]Seriously, the amount of phlegm I've had.
[84:58.95]I've been like...
[85:01.11]Oh dude, it's $2,000 for a credit card stealer.
[85:03.88]So if we find a credit card, we can just... Get a ladder.
[85:11.05]Stun gun?
[85:12.33]Stun dart.
[85:18.29]Oh, hold on.
[85:19.69]Skill leaflet reward box.
[85:21.40]Hey, if we have 500 bucks extra, we can open a loot box.
[85:27.58]Hell yeah.
[85:28.55]Loot boxes, dog.
[85:31.55]Alright, we ready to give it a go?
[85:34.72]Yeah, I'm ready.
[85:37.90]Alright, we need 2,500 bucks.
[85:39.74]We have three days.
[85:42.41]Be careful.
[85:43.38]Focus.
[85:44.52]I need you guys to focus.
[85:46.71]Focus G.
[85:48.88]I'm going to the same building with the glass cutter.
[85:53.92]You can evade attacks by right click backwards.
[85:59.01]Really?
[86:00.54]Oh my god, it is a dodge.
[86:02.98]Huh.
[86:04.46]Alright, I feel like we've been going to the same two houses.
[86:06.78]So, maybe let's take a stroll.
[86:10.22]Let's walk down the street.
[86:12.36]There's no other map, right?
[86:15.05]You love doing that.
[86:16.54]You guys are all going to this guy's house again.
[86:19.31]No, remember, these storage units have security measures, so we can't even break in.
[86:24.61]You know what looks good?
[86:25.65]The pawn shop.
[86:26.39]Well, I have the glass cutter, so, like, it's the only trigger?
[86:29.46]No, there's an alarm system in there.
[86:31.29]Because I went in...
[86:31.83]I think there's an alarm on the front door.
[86:33.29]No, the alarm system...
[86:34.60]The code is in here.
[86:37.59]9821, right?
[86:38.87]No, it's different every time.
[86:40.98]Guys, I'm at the pawn shop.
[86:43.27]Pawn shop?
[86:43.72]I'll come with you.
[86:45.06]Come to the pawn shop.
[86:47.09]3-2-9-3.
[86:48.67]But where do you turn it off?
[86:52.59]Use a glass knife here.
[86:55.06]Pawn Shop needs simple lockpick.
[86:57.52]Do you have that, Joe?
[86:58.04]I think you can't open this one because the shutter is closed.
[87:00.13]I do have a rock.
[87:04.31]I mean, look at all this shit in there, dude.
[87:06.67]If I throw the rock and it sma- What the fuck was that?
[87:09.90]I hear him.
[87:10.35]He's so close.
[87:11.23]Oops.
[87:11.89]What, did you just ring the doorbell?
[87:12.94]Yeah, we need electronics for that.
[87:14.00]I don't know why I did that.
[87:15.77]Oh.
[87:17.84]Is somebody coming?
[87:18.75]Oh, somebody is coming.
[87:20.50]This guy's going to kill us.
[87:21.99]No, don't!
[87:22.43]Wait, we just wanted the fucking door!
[87:23.84]We wanted the...
[87:24.63]What?!
[87:24.85]!
[87:26.23]We just wanted to buy some merch.
[87:28.00]We were just curious if you were still open.
[87:29.44]It said you were open on Google Maps.
[87:30.83]We were checking to see.
[87:31.85]Sometimes it's wrong.
[87:32.97]Oh, my God.
[87:42.65]This is just too close to reality.
[87:46.45]I love how you rang.
[87:49.38]You know what?
[87:49.84]I thought it was a code.
[87:51.85]I could enter a code.
[87:52.89]I was going to guess the code.
[87:54.21]I rang it after you.
[87:55.26]I rang it right after you.
[87:58.13]Good luck, sir.
[87:59.59]You got a... Did you get anything?
[88:01.90]Yeah.
[88:03.07]Click return and then run away.
[88:06.62]You just ducked...
[88:08.72]oh my god oh it's a hundred bucks every time that happens where the hell is he I mean I lost my glass cutter too because whatever you've you it was I do you guys it was you
[88:19.27]Okay, in my and Vinny's defense, we rang a doorbell at a business and the guy killed us both.
[88:27.68]Your glass cutter's here.
[88:29.51]Oh, nice.
[88:35.37]It's a wonder that guy makes any money to keep the business going.
[88:40.27]Really.
[88:42.26]How much money do we have?
[88:44.02]Zero.
[88:44.99]Shit.
[88:47.08]I mean, we need a couple of items, right?
[88:49.00]We got to sell something.
[88:56.19]Do we have no items to sell either?
[88:59.73]Nada.
[89:00.19]Where's all of our shit?
[89:01.12]Is it because we got a game over?
[89:05.00]Wait, maybe?
[89:09.74]I think if we all die.
[89:11.06]You can buy information on the buildings in here.
[89:15.57]Like the pawn shop, you can buy hints and shit.
[89:18.98]We need money to buy it.
[89:20.77]It's probably like 500 bucks.
[89:22.65]Alright.
[89:23.50]Yeah.
[89:24.48]Let's try.
[89:25.00]I mean, we just gotta have to do it.
[89:28.61]Alright.
[89:28.95]Gotta run it down.
[89:30.74]I'm going to go to the house on the right.
[89:33.95]And I'm gonna go there alone.
[89:37.66]Okay, everybody go alone and we get to see who like the real criminal is.
[89:43.51]Yeah, let's see what we bring back.
[89:44.92]Make fun of whoever loses first.
[89:47.19]Okay.
[89:48.21]Oh, really?
[89:49.05]We're doing side quests?
[89:50.50]Alright.
[89:51.12]I'll do that.
[89:51.64]Come back with a haul and whoever has the coolest haul.
[89:55.24]Alright.
[89:56.30]That's pretty... Yeah.
[89:58.37]I kind of go off on my own a lot in these types of games anyway, so...
[90:02.56]What could go wrong?
[90:04.69]Apparently there's a warehouse people are saying that we can use.
[90:07.34]What the fuck, dude?
[90:08.33]What are you doing out here?
[90:09.47]What?
[90:10.20]Oh my god.
[90:12.25]Well, there's the, there's the problem.
[90:14.88]This person's sitting in total, complete fucking darkness.
[90:18.90]I didn't even see her.
[90:21.16]Looks like everyone's gonna be more alert now, guys.
[90:23.17]Watch out.
[90:24.70]That didn't take very long.
[90:30.91]Also, why does the pawn shop guy live in his business?
[90:34.73]I guess that happens once in a while.
[90:36.18]Some people just, yeah, it's fine.
[90:38.15]What are you doing in your own yard?
[90:39.52]Yeah, but I mean, that was weird.
[90:43.74]Why don't we come like later when everyone's asleep?
[90:50.30]You know, that's an interesting thing that you just proposed there.
[91:00.43]Oh, I was in this building earlier.
[91:01.94]Oh god.
[91:03.81]Okay, this person's right here.
[91:05.28]Uh oh.
[91:20.66]I don't know what to do here.
[91:29.84]What?
[91:34.30]It just didn't hit her.
[91:48.84]No, I just always...
[91:56.46]I'm too tired to jump.
[92:06.48]Did you need help, man?
[92:08.08]I'm alright.
[92:08.75]Yeah.
[92:10.96]Open this door.
[92:15.32]I've got the glass cutter, but none of this counts.
[92:18.72]I've accomplished nothing.
[92:23.06]I'm still alive.
[92:26.69]I'm running away.
[92:28.38]I'm finding a new house.
[92:39.13]least two of you guys are still alive at least all of you are alive except me what the
[92:46.98]Hey, dude, my name is this in Splatoon.
[92:49.19]I don't care.
[92:53.08]What are you talking about, dude?
[93:08.42]Oh, fuck.
[93:11.71]Why is it getting more red?
[93:12.98]Oh, it's a camera.
[93:15.93]How are they so fast?
[93:18.80]What?
[93:28.22]Oh my god.
[93:29.49]It just throws it.
[93:31.72]All I need is a coffee mug and I win this challenge, by the way.
[93:34.50]Oh God.
[93:36.28]I dropped a phone on my body in the glass cutter.
[93:40.50]Just like right next to the truck.
[93:43.52]Are you sure you're not playing on hard mode?
[93:47.68]I think we're just supposed to learn how to play the game and be perfect.
[93:53.31]I think it's just a very tricky game, but it's very fun.
[93:58.91]I like it a lot.
[94:01.85]It's cute.
[94:03.41]Okay, so let's go.
[94:05.83]I win.
[94:07.64]Nice job.
[94:08.26]Challenge everybody.
[94:09.45]You were the first person to alert the cops.
[94:12.53]Was that part of our awareness everywhere else?
[94:14.86]I mean, but was that part of the deal?
[94:16.43]I don't remember that being part of the deal.
[94:18.67]That was the whole point.
[94:21.64]Did you have anything?
[94:22.39]No.
[94:24.21]My body's in the middle of the street.
[94:25.50]I got things on it.
[94:26.80]Look at this.
[94:28.27]Oh, a phone, too.
[94:30.42]Is that all you had?
[94:33.20]I have some underwear and pants.
[94:36.27]Take those.
[94:38.76]We definitely don't have $2,500.
[94:40.13]No.
[94:45.13]Hey, but that's 39 bucks.
[94:47.57]Am I just resetting this?
[94:49.26]Which is the thing I found!
[94:52.21]you mean I found it on the ground fine you know what I'll go get an item right now prove it fine cop cop cop to your right cop's running
[95:03.24]Oh my God.
[95:04.31]They're just so alert.
[95:05.68]They're just so alert.
[95:14.13]You lost him.
[95:17.40]What do you mean?
[95:18.30]Never mind.
[95:19.08]He found you.
[95:21.25]Drop the phone in there.
[95:22.11]Just make sure you drop the shit in here.
[95:27.31]He lost you.
[95:31.64]I have the natural instinct as always to crouch behind that table.
[95:34.43]That they can very clearly still see.
[95:38.99]One experience, two dollars.
[95:42.61]Hey, at least we're left with 40 bucks.
[95:45.29]I feel like they don't see you because the head has no hitbox.
[95:48.77]So if you crouch, I think you actually... Alright, here's what we're going to do this time.
[95:53.45]All four of us are going to go to the house on the right.
[95:57.38]We are going to observe.
[95:59.70]Bring a gun?
[96:01.03]No.
[96:01.39]Nobody just, nobody go into the front door.
[96:03.26]Nobody open a window.
[96:04.18]We're going to see what she does.
[96:05.97]We're going to wait until we have an opportunity.
[96:10.32]And then we'll go for it.
[96:12.45]Okay.
[96:12.69]What's up, Game Master?
[96:13.94]Let's do it.
[96:15.44]But how do we get in?
[96:16.39]We don't have a lockpick.
[96:18.08]Uh, the back window is open.
[96:20.46]Okay.
[96:21.31]One of us is going to be a lookout.
[96:23.36]One of us is going to be the one that goes in to steal.
[96:26.28]The other one is going to be a distractor.
[96:28.51]If something happens to, you know, throw a rock at the wall.
[96:31.48]So she goes, what was that noise?
[96:33.63]What was that noise?
[96:35.83]Why are you in charge?
[96:36.76]You're the worst one.
[96:37.71]I'm the one that left with $40 last time, by the way.
[96:44.10]Jerma cannot be the worst one when I exist.
[96:46.90]I'm happy that anyone is in charge.
[96:49.47]Alright, so everybody come over here.
[96:50.76]This house right here.
[96:53.40]the basic tutorial house tutorial house we're going to security we're going to observe don't go in where is she is she everybody sitting in the back
[97:03.39]Let me check.
[97:04.56]Right there.
[97:04.86]She's right there.
[97:06.15]She's gardening.
[97:07.48]There's a guy behind us, too.
[97:08.50]Look.
[97:09.15]So right now, somebody go in the back door and start to wipe this lady up.
[97:15.47]I'm gonna start wiping.
[97:16.64]Okay, and I will... We will tell you when she's moving.
[97:20.81]Oh, you can ping people.
[97:23.10]How?
[97:23.44]Okay, I can, you can like, I think middle mouse pings her.
[97:28.49]We're looking at her.
[97:29.21]You're good, you're good.
[97:31.04]Start looting.
[97:32.96]Let me know when things are getting too crazy and I'll get out of here.
[97:35.62]Cop is like looking at, walking to us.
[97:37.39]Yeah, cop is walking over here.
[97:39.01]You guys are fine.
[97:39.66]Just stay crouched.
[97:41.38]Cease operations and crouch.
[97:42.95]I found $100.
[97:45.86]She hears you guys.
[97:46.80]Cease operations out the back window.
[97:48.35]Cease operations.
[97:49.07]She hears something out the back window.
[97:50.88]She's coming in front yard right now.
[97:52.79]The fuck did she hear?
[97:55.89]We managed to avoid her.
[97:57.53]We're good.
[97:57.86]We're good.
[97:58.38]I got a crock pot.
[97:59.64]I got a crock pot.
[98:00.38]Slow cooker.
[98:02.51]Excellent.
[98:03.17]She's coming back out if you guys missed anything.
[98:06.25]Yeah, almost everything has been missed, unfortunately.
[98:09.60]She's sitting on the porch now.
[98:11.06]You have an opportunity.
[98:12.29]Just be silent about it.
[98:13.31]She's sitting out right in front of that front window.
[98:15.54]That's where she is.
[98:16.24]Cop is coming back.
[98:19.46]I would say get out of view of the window.
[98:21.25]Police officers walking by.
[98:25.52]Got a U-Pod, an iPod.
[98:28.74]Okay.
[98:29.64]Stunning.
[98:30.16]Stunning officer.
[98:30.84]Stunning.
[98:31.45]No, I'm just kidding.
[98:34.26]I think we got everything here.
[98:36.19]She's suspicious.
[98:37.07]She can see somebody or she can hear somebody.
[98:38.42]She's coming, she's coming, she's coming.
[98:39.52]Cops pissed too at me.
[98:41.89]What did I do?
[98:42.87]What'd I do?
[98:43.67]What the hell's going on?
[98:45.00]What did you do?
[98:45.73]What'd I do?
[98:48.78]You're dressed kind of gooncore.
[98:51.05]What did you do?
[98:52.01]Oh my god.
[98:53.50]Everybody out.
[98:56.62]Yeah, a slow cooker is probably not going to be enough.
[99:11.39]Okay, actually I might be making a big play here guys.
[99:18.86]Big play?
[99:20.20]Distracting the cops.
[99:22.80]Big time right now.
[99:23.54]You guys are gonna lose.
[99:25.95]Why did you just stand there?
[99:26.87]I didn't think I was gonna get immediately killed.
[99:29.44]I thought he was going after Poke.
[99:31.98]What are you doing?
[99:37.66]I don't know.
[99:44.35]Who's alive right now?
[99:49.51]I don't know what came over me.
[99:51.65]Alright, Vinny, at least go in and you got to wipe out the whole house now.
[99:56.64]I can't get in.
[100:07.14]You see that mountain in the distance?
[100:08.42]We can go there.
[100:10.40]Yeah, you can't.
[100:12.43]I feel like we're playing on, we made the game, we've turned off like the difficulty of the police.
[100:22.16]Alright, I'm alive.
[100:23.87]I have no way to get into anyone else's house.
[100:28.24]What should I do?
[100:29.22]What should I do?
[100:30.29]Poke, this is a big brain move.
[100:32.15]I don't know what to do here.
[100:38.27]Vinny, can you punch?
[100:39.82]Ooh.
[100:46.19]That person's in their pajamas, Vinny.
[100:48.32]Oh, my God.
[100:55.41]I just got killed by a resident.
[100:58.42]That guy had Super Mario pajamas on and he came and just smashed you in the head.
[101:07.93]I tried to pick up the wine, but it wouldn't let me.
[101:10.88]Oh my god, oh my god This game is made for fucking geniuses
[101:22.20]I think we're doing- I think I'm having a great time.
[101:26.40]This is fun.
[101:29.75]If I leave, we're all dead again.
[101:33.34]I'm just getting aggro for you, I don't know.
[101:36.35]Poka's doing the tank strategy.
[101:38.52]Wade mastered this game?
[101:40.95]I don't think it matters because like the moment I do anything, it'll summon different cops.
[101:45.82]Holy shit, you're being staked out like there was a fucking mass shooting.
[101:50.38]Holy shit, there's a million people coming over here, Poke.
[101:57.90]Poke, the whole town is over here.
[102:04.88]No, they're leaving.
[102:06.59]Car 15 responding.
[102:13.28]So do I just...
[102:16.98]Ster, are you looting?
[102:18.37]Yeah, Ster, you should have an opportunity to get some stuff.
[102:28.22]I love how they can't figure out to get up on top where you are.
[102:38.48]I'm about to do a crime.
[102:52.32]Nice.
[102:55.31]Dude, can you steal that whole barbecue?
[102:58.61]I wish.
[103:00.14]Everything's locked.
[103:01.00]I'm like a shitty criminal.
[103:05.03]Got a phone?
[103:07.87]And then I think you open this back door and it immediately alerts.
[103:10.98]I think this is where Vinny died.
[103:22.88]If the door is open already?
[103:24.68]Yeah, that's where I died.
[103:25.99]To be fair, there is stuff in there that I dropped that you probably take.
[103:29.84]I have a crock pot you could have.
[103:31.38]I wonder if there's a way to disable the... Maybe on the back?
[103:36.02]Back panel or something?
[103:47.55]Okay, that weirdly didn't trip the alarm.
[103:54.19]Huh.
[103:55.48]Maybe because you already did it, Vinny.
[103:56.64]It's tripped already.
[103:59.31]Somebody lives here, Ster, and they have a baseball bat.
[104:01.16]Oh, that's, yeah.
[104:02.16]No, they do have a baseball bat.
[104:03.89]They hit me in the face with it.
[104:09.42]I don't know how to, you can't like throw this.
[104:14.01]Is it vintage or something?
[104:23.22]I have to go out the front door?
[104:25.31]You'd have to press G to drop it.
[104:27.08]You probably... That seems tough.
[104:30.43]Can't jump while I'm holding it
[104:39.17]Just aim up.
[104:39.79]Oh, there you go.
[104:40.72]Oh, hell yeah.
[104:42.26]That might be worth a lot of money.
[104:45.14]I'll depot it right now.
[104:48.43]That's good.
[104:49.27]So that's teamwork.
[104:50.84]Alright, so if you can track where this person is, they might be asleep.
[104:54.53]So you actually might be able to get more things.
[104:56.37]I hear people walking around in here.
[105:01.49]You have to hold interact to pick up heavy items.
[105:04.61]I think, okay, if I had a med kit, you could probably get me back.
[105:09.71]I don't think you had it.
[105:10.84]I picked up everything that was on the floor.
[105:13.02]Oh, you did?
[105:13.59]Oh, no, no, no.
[105:14.61]I see the red object right there.
[105:16.66]Get me back.
[105:17.14]Get me back.
[105:20.07]Oh, shit.
[105:20.96]You applied that to yourself, didn't you?
[105:22.22]Oh, okay.
[105:22.80]Yeah, okay.
[105:24.25]It's left click on yourself, hold E on you, and I didn't know.
[105:28.18]Oh, no.
[105:28.68]I feel really good now.
[105:29.93]that's fine it's fine I didn't want to play you got uh it's almost morning is there I think there might be a time limit
[105:48.71]Was that somebody in the Discord call or was that the guy in the house?
[105:54.35]It was in the game.
[106:05.30]Alright, you're good.
[106:06.55]You're in the clear.
[106:09.28]Why didn't the cops instantly appear?
[106:11.34]I don't think he called them.
[106:12.48]I think he's just kind of taken matters into his own hands and he just kills intruders apparently.
[106:19.52]Oh, he's a castle doctrine.
[106:22.16]Vinny walked in and he just instantly smashed his head in.
[106:25.47]Yeah, he didn't even want to ask or talk to me.
[106:34.14]Are we leaving, Oak?
[106:36.40]Are you in the car?
[106:38.11]Yeah.
[106:39.44]Wait, maybe... Holy fuck.
[106:41.16]I have an idea.
[106:42.51]Let me try to get more loot before you press it.
[106:46.37]Vinny, that reminds me of a soundboard, back when people used to do that.
[106:51.52]Holy shit, Lois.
[106:53.15]Yeah.
[106:56.55]Jerma do you know of of that the Peter Griffin um
[107:03.69]The holy fuck-er.
[107:05.60]The time is like knocking red.
[107:08.68]What is it?
[107:09.52]Hold on.
[107:10.20]I have never seen the episode, but there's an episode where Peter Griffin is like enraptured in joy, like sexual pleasure.
[107:17.19]And I people just keep putting it in games and like videos now and I just like once a month I keep here.
[107:23.93]Holy fuck Lois
[107:25.37]I'm like, that's real?
[107:26.90]Like, I could never picture Homer Simpson doing that.
[107:29.96]But yeah, they turned him into a goon man in the show, Family Guy.
[107:34.06]Peter's always kind of been a freak though, hasn't he?
[107:36.98]He's a little, yeah, he's edgier than like a Simpson, you know?
[107:41.92]Is he a freak?
[107:42.38]That's not a real episode.
[107:44.17]Well, very early on.
[107:45.60]Remember very early on?
[107:46.74]What do you want, a Cleveland Steamer?
[107:51.90]That's like an episode eight of the second season.
[107:56.71]I'm going to be real.
[107:57.46]I thought Stanley Steamer was a Cleveland Steamer.
[108:02.58]for like a couple years, and I thought that the company, Stanley Steamer, who does your carpets, I thought they were named after like a sex pose.
[108:11.25]And I was like, why would they do this?
[108:13.48]You ordered the wrong thing.
[108:15.07]We lose, by the way.
[108:18.04]Do we lose?
[108:19.28]I think we lose.
[108:21.67]We need 2300 something, I think.
[108:30.07]Alright, there's 190.
[108:34.32]At some point today, I'm going to show you guys my cookies.
[108:36.47]We'll talk about that later.
[108:39.08]None of these were part of a combo, I don't think.
[108:41.14]Cookies.
[108:42.15]Are we ready?
[108:42.91]I'll tell you later.
[108:44.87]Are you selling the book for real?
[108:46.07]I think we have to.
[108:46.84]It sells for money.
[108:47.68]Alright, here we go.
[108:52.68]Oh.
[108:53.72]It's almost half.
[109:00.14]This is what happens when criminals don't get their way.
[109:04.66]They just start fighting.
[109:08.00]Ow!
[109:08.76]Hide in the building.
[109:09.33]Hide in the building.
[109:09.77]He gave a sniper in the building.
[109:12.90]Hide in the building and crouch in like the bathtub or something.
[109:16.03]Hey, I just want to let you know that I think honestly like
[109:19.29]I just been wanting to tell you that.
[109:20.84]I think... Hey, the funny moment.
[109:24.25]Holy fuck, Jammer.
[109:26.46]Wait, what the hell?
[109:27.02]Talking game.
[109:27.97]What the hell?

[109:47.85]I can increase our starting credits by 500 bucks.
[109:50.34]I'm doing it.
[109:51.44]Oh, so there's like cheating.
[109:53.85]We unlocked it.
[109:54.54]It's a roguelike.
[109:55.24]It has a Cleveland steamer mode bottom left.
[109:58.34]Steamers on the bottom left, yeah.
[110:00.65]Cleveland steamer.
[110:04.79]Am I inviting you guys again?
[110:06.36]Are we going for it again?

[110:12.34]I'm totally down to do a locked-in gamer mode, yeah.
[110:16.74]Wait, really?
[110:17.58]Someone said next game.
[110:18.53]I opened the next game.
[110:19.52]Oh, crap.
[110:21.76]Listen, whatever you guys want to do, I'm just happy to be here.
[110:25.32]Why did you buy two ladders?
[110:27.55]Shut up.
[110:28.44]What?
[110:28.84]No, honestly, why did you buy two of these?
[110:32.06]What's the point of you having two of these?
[110:34.23]You could put them one on top of another.
[110:36.80]You clicked twice accidentally and you wasted like $300.
[110:39.33]No, I wanted both.
[110:40.45]I just wanted both.
[110:41.72]I want to climb over the pawn shop fence.
[110:44.21]I gotta invite Vinny and let me invite Poke.

[111:00.49]Do you lose the unlock?
[111:02.22]I don't think so.
[111:03.99]He's just mad that I bought two ladders.
[111:07.46]Well, I mean, that's also part of it too.
[111:11.21]Okay, hold on.

[111:33.77]And you bought a second ladder again.
[111:35.31]And I don't know why you're buying these.
[111:37.60]That seems like a waste of money.

[121:33.81]I shouldn't do this ever again.
[121:34.68]You can get your throat fucked for a month?
[121:36.82]Guys it's me Hey, how'd you do that?
[121:43.16]I
[121:44.19]Okay.
[121:46.30]Hold on.
[121:48.13]I've been playing a lot of face fuck games.
[121:49.86]What are you guys doing?
[121:51.14]Facebook games That's not why my I got sick and my
[121:59.44]Dude, we have so much stuff.
[122:00.65]We gotta check for combinations.
[122:07.19]I wanna read this basic lockpicking book.
[122:10.57]Alright.
[122:10.97]Do it.
[122:11.33]Credit card.
[122:12.23]Cuz we already have the skill.
[122:13.72]Yeah.
[122:14.99]Wait, do we all get it?
[122:15.77]I think only you do.
[122:17.56]I think we all level up.
[122:19.54]Learned new skill backpacker.
[122:21.29]Did anyone else get that?
[122:22.74]You got it?
[122:23.16]No, you took it for yourself.
[122:25.82]Wait, can everybody just read it?
[122:28.27]What if we all just read it?
[122:29.94]It disappears when I read it.
[122:32.81]Oh, no, my lockpicking one says skill already learned, so maybe we did all earn it.
[122:37.37]Alright, now say, next time, gadget, next time.
[122:41.53]Next time, Gadget.
[122:43.46]Next time.
[122:44.89]Perfect.
[122:46.14]That's perfect.
[122:47.17]That'll be the last time I can do that.
[122:48.53]Ship that one.
[122:49.10]Are you okay?
[122:51.47]Huh?
[122:52.78]Well, yeah.
[122:53.16]Why were you assuming I'm not okay?
[122:56.57]Okay.
[122:58.66]What is not part of a combination that we can sell?
[123:01.73]I don't know.
[123:02.59]You're the only person who knows what the combinations are.
[123:06.45]Everybody can do it.
[123:07.13]Go to the computer and go to item requests.
[123:09.26]No.
[123:10.28]Well then, I guess it's gonna be me that's the only one that knows.
[123:13.56]Can we buy a lockpick?
[123:15.03]I'll be right back.
[123:16.14]Alright, we need a cooking pot.
[123:17.83]That's the, okay, goal.
[123:20.26]That was playing Fortnite, just like trolling.
[123:23.28]And this kid, he was like, he did the same voice.
[123:25.97]I'm actually 44 years old.
[123:28.48]This is the funniest shit.
[123:30.97]I'm actually 40.
[123:32.73]He's like eight years older than the boys.
[123:35.11]Vinny, here's what we did.
[123:37.72]Stop hurting yourself.
[123:39.65]We need to get...
[123:40.67]This is priority for the next mission.
[123:42.90]A cooking pot.
[123:44.61]A slow cooker.
[123:47.85]a red credit card, or a loaded leather wallet.
[123:52.93]We'll look for a slow cooker or cooking pot.
[123:56.95]Okay.
[123:59.51]Also car toolbox.
[124:02.71]We have a leather wallet, but I don't think it's loaded.
[124:05.08]We need a load.
[124:07.27]There's no ammo in it.
[124:09.27]I'm back.
[124:11.41]I think the easiest thing for us to do is to get a slow cooker.
[124:13.79]Slow cooker and a cooking pot.
[124:15.95]That's the job.
[124:16.81]Oh, guys.
[124:18.25]Yo, this is someone... Dude, Jerma, I think you care.
[124:21.79]Mm-hmm.
[124:22.57]The new... Bro, the ninja...
[124:26.27]Air cooker with the glass thing.
[124:27.70]The air fryer.
[124:28.45]The glass one.
[124:29.73]Good.
[124:30.36]That one?
[124:30.90]No, no.
[124:31.44]So good.
[124:32.45]So good.
[124:33.67]I guess I have to show them my cookies now.
[124:38.46]The glass air fryer.
[124:40.04]Did you make the banana doll whip thing?
[124:43.99]I haven't made anything since that day.
[124:51.16]there you alright so you made the day we talked about that is the last time you used that appliance yes
[125:01.48]Oh shit, what are these?
[125:03.70]I made those in the air fryer.
[125:05.53]It's so funny, dude, because we were talking about how excited you were.
[125:08.84]You were like, dude, I'm going to make smoothies in there.
[125:11.89]Man, I'm telling you, I'm gonna make, you know, for the first time ever, I think I'm gonna make a creme brulee in there.
[125:16.65]Dude, you were talking about all this delicious,
[125:18.32]Chef shit you were gonna do in there and you tell me you haven't even turned it on since like a year ago Yeah, no No
[125:26.28]That's so funny.
[125:27.89]And Vinny, these are your cookies?
[125:30.29]Mm-hmm.
[125:30.46]What is this?
[125:33.20]These are interesting.
[125:34.73]These look like rabbit shit.
[125:36.88]It looks like brownie maggots.
[125:39.61]It looks like...
[125:42.16]There's Thanksgiving dinner.
[125:43.79]Dude, this does look like fucking rabbit poop.
[125:47.92]I wanted to make cookies, but I didn't want to start the oven.
[125:53.17]So I figured I had this great idea.
[125:54.42]Let me use the air fryer.
[125:56.22]And I didn't put parchment sheet down on the crisping tray, so it started leaking through the holes.
[126:02.09]And I was like, that's interesting.
[126:03.81]Let me experiment with that.
[126:04.65]I wanted to make stalactite cookies.
[126:06.90]with drippings and it ended up just kind of coming off and dripping into a weird rabbit shit like texture
[126:16.92]What the fuck did you use for the last photo?
[126:18.59]A PC?
[126:20.32]A PC case?
[126:21.22]What's the last photo?
[126:23.10]Yeah, what is that?
[126:23.69]That does look like the top of a computer case.
[126:25.35]It looks like someone left it.
[126:26.57]It was a computer.
[126:27.76]They forgot it on a fucking computer.
[126:28.82]oh my chat hasn't seen that photo yet hang on one of your college fucking roommates like took a dump on the top of your pc like yo bro I'm gonna get him so bad
[126:40.77]Let me show.
[126:41.33]I haven't shown my chat that.
[126:42.88]No, that one.
[126:43.44]You know what that one is.
[126:46.76]That is not...
[126:47.62]I'll show you.
[126:48.18]Hang on.
[126:48.47]That's not a PC.
[126:49.43]Dude, Dave is going to wake up.
[126:50.52]He's going to be so mad.
[126:51.50]He's not going to be able to play Counter-Strike.
[126:53.51]Who the fuck shit on my Xbox?
[126:55.92]Hey, dude, remember when you killed me like 3-0 in Counter-Strike last night?
[126:59.77]Yeah, well, I tried doing it today.
[127:03.87]That's not a PC.
[127:04.79]That's a pizza crisping tray that I put in the oven.
[127:11.51]Bring problem rolling into the repair shop with like a dump cover to Xbox heatsink The problem with that strategy is
[127:21.03]was that I'm gonna post one more picture I had it drip down onto the
[127:27.92]parchment paper below, but they burned because of the intense heat, so it just smelled like burning.
[127:33.20]You're tricking us into looking at your fucking poop.
[127:37.21]No, but look at the strategy.
[127:38.44]Look at the strategy.
[127:39.20]You pooped on your curtain, and you're so proud of it.
[127:41.44]It's like one of those medical subreddits where people are like, oh, hey, man, so I like...
[127:45.74]I feel like my shit's been really fucked up lately.
[127:48.22]Like, is this normal?
[127:50.39]Dude, this would be someone you know.
[127:52.12]Why the fuck would they use Mario font for the fucking cookie droppings?
[127:56.48]That's my friend, one of my mods, yeah.
[127:59.03]What is that, Wolfenstein?
[128:00.32]The cookie stalactites?
[128:03.93]Well, that was the thing.
[128:05.23]And I have another mod who's going to be experimenting this weekend with these cookies.
[128:10.14]We want to make stalactite cookies.
[128:14.10]What the hell is this?
[128:16.15]We were trying to just do something strange and interesting and new.
[128:19.24]So this is the method to the madness is this picture.
[128:22.87]Hold on.
[128:24.18]understand it that's how we however the cookie droppings in the if the heat is too high burn and it just smells like burning and it's not good and they they're not
[128:34.17]It works better in an air fryer because the heat is a little lower and the cookies are closer to the heat source, which is how I got the stalactite cookie.
[128:44.29]You should make a whole new machine for this and sell it.
[128:47.35]Something interesting could happen here.
[128:49.04]And let me tell you, the stalactites or the dookies, if you will,
[128:53.42]actually are crispy so the one that looks like rabbit shit
[128:57.84]interestingly is um it was tasty because you have a soft cookie and you have like crispy cookie droppings
[129:07.09]You know that it just got the ninjas the lactite meter people want to do some crimes cavemen used to literally kill each other over the rabbit carcass that was on the ground.
[129:15.30]You know, I mean
[129:15.80]Look at where we are now.
[129:17.01]You're talking about stalactite.
[129:17.96]Oh yeah, you would know because you've been living that fucking long, Nosferatu.
[129:20.29]I'm just talking about
[129:20.88]We're talking about cookie stalactite poop food and people used to literally wring each other's necks over like the rabbit carcass that was available.
[129:29.08]Yeah.
[129:30.46]It's the Lakshites.
[129:32.89]Did you bite any of them?
[129:34.82]I've eaten them.
[129:35.63]I ate all of that.
[129:37.26]Do you think the cavemen were sitting around going, you see, but if we take the rabbit carcass and smush it through rocks...
[129:43.49]These twirl too hard to rock down and we smush carcass and you sit on the carcass and then you make slag tight rabbit cookie poop.
[129:54.05]Dude, how do you think pate was invented?
[129:55.76]No, they killed and ate that guy.
[129:57.64]They killed and ate that guy, I think.
[129:59.72]No, this is how we invented food.
[130:02.20]Any of the recipes we have today started with shit like that.
[130:05.29]Yeah, well, who made the first sauce?
[130:08.28]Italians.
[130:09.63]Why?
[130:11.69]Because, I don't know, we were- See, you see what I'm saying?
[130:14.61]Do you see what I'm saying?
[130:15.86]To be bored with food means abundance.
[130:19.58]Was it farming?
[130:21.00]When, who made the first sauce?
[130:22.97]And I'm not talking about like the meat drippings that fell off the rabbit carcass.
[130:26.21]Who made the first sauce?
[130:29.08]Ever.
[130:29.68]Meat drippings.
[130:32.11]John Sauce.
[130:37.44]There's gotta be someone named Sauce.
[130:39.09]They're bored as fuck with this game.
[130:41.66]No, let's do it.
[130:42.30]Let's climb it.
[130:43.43]Alright, hold on.
[130:44.25]Let me send this loot.
[130:45.13]And kill people.
[130:46.92]Dude, look at all that loot.
[130:48.33]We need two greater bucks.
[130:52.66]Alright, you gonna get the baseball bat?
[130:54.91]No.
[130:56.06]Maybe I'll get a lockpick.
[130:57.59]I got a rock.
[131:01.69]Also, I put a lot of stuff in... Oh.
[131:04.05]Like, why is Bobby pin named Bobby?
[131:05.98]Who the hell's Bobby?
[131:07.63]Right, but food was survival.
[131:09.96]Food was just survival.
[131:11.55]It wasn't...
[131:12.96]Oh, this is fun to make.
[131:15.45]Look, I'm going to make something out of this.
[131:16.81]No, you ate the rabbit carcass because that's how people survived back 10,000 years ago.
[131:22.80]How do you know?
[131:23.68]How do I know that there wasn't a guy with like the lint chef costume on holding the chocolate thing, dripping the chocolate into a container?
[131:31.73]to be a literal pastry chef I'm just saying people like oh when cook rabbit it tastes better than raw rabbit I'm just saying who the is that guy
[131:41.80]Who is the Lindt chef guy?
[131:43.55]Probably a lot of people.
[131:45.20]Hold on, I gotta make my point here.
[131:46.80]I don't think there's one guy who spread the concept of cooking across the whole world.
[131:52.25]Hold on, hold on.
[131:52.74]Like St. Nick with presents for kids.
[131:55.49]Oh, you get tomato sauce and you get a fucking creamy mustard.
[131:59.96]I'm going to link a picture into the chat because I'm very curious how you guys feel about this.
[132:09.26]I found a website that posted Vin Diesel's Facebook photos.
[132:17.74]Hold on.
[132:19.57]I'm going to post this in the chat.
[132:22.59]Vinny.
[132:23.19]Oh, shit.
[132:23.55]Don't scroll too far, probably.
[132:25.32]Don't scroll too.
[132:26.06]I won't.
[132:26.48]No, I won't.
[132:28.07]I won't.
[132:28.31]It's safe.
[132:28.69]It's safe.
[132:29.23]Don't scroll.
[132:30.84]It's safe.
[132:31.46]Dude, I need a picture of this fucking guy.
[132:35.99]Of who, Vin Diesel or the pasta maker?
[132:38.82]Hold on.
[132:39.99]Why is it so hard to get?
[132:47.63]Okay.
[132:49.02]I'm showing a picture of my stream right now and I'm going to send it to you guys right now.
[132:53.31]This one's funny.
[132:55.46]Who the fuck is this guy?
[132:56.52]Is this a real guy?
[133:01.64]Notice two of the same tiger cub.
[133:06.83]Or lion cub.
[133:07.64]How far down is that one?
[133:09.00]21?
[133:14.95]Okay.
[133:15.25]Do you guys see the chocolatier guy?
[133:20.20]Is that a model?
[133:21.49]Is that a model for the advertisement or is that a real guy that does chocolate stuff?
[133:29.60]Oh, well, he's really low resolution.
[133:35.05]I think he's a real chocolate guy.
[133:36.40]Do you think that's a real chocolate?
[133:37.40]Okay, is it...
[133:38.77]When do you...
[133:41.61]I wouldn't think they would trust a random guy to do the technique like that.
[133:45.25]I think it's a model.
[133:46.04]I think that's just a model.
[133:47.04]But maybe not.
[133:48.01]Maybe that's a real chocolatier guy.
[133:50.24]You know how badly I like, okay, if I could choose a different life, I would want to be this guy holding up the thing and dripping it into the thing.
[133:59.92]That's how I feel, Jerma, in my brain when I make my cookies.
[134:05.00]Like, I feel like I look like that guy.
[134:07.35]You feel like this guy, but then you end up with this.
[134:13.53]Yeah.
[134:17.42]That's so funny.
[134:21.24]Oh my god, Jerma.
[134:22.34]Someone made... Oh my god.
[134:24.25]Someone made art of the exact... Oh my god.
[134:27.18]What?
[134:28.24]J-Jerba, check the chat.
[134:29.29]Look, look, look.
[134:30.53]Oh my god!
[134:31.34]It is!
[134:31.56]It's real!
[134:32.77]This is real!
[134:33.65]This is you!
[134:34.94]What the fuck?
[134:36.61]Did they do this right now?
[134:37.64]How fast did you do this?
[134:38.71]No, no, no.
[134:39.03]This was done prior.
[134:40.73]It's AI.
[134:41.81]I'm sorry.
[134:42.13]I'm kidding.
[134:42.76]No, this was posted a couple days ago.
[134:49.20]Holy shit.
[134:51.63]What is that tool?
[134:53.48]Why is he using a Grammy to do this?
[134:56.43]I don't know.
[134:56.93]Wait, what is this tool?
[134:59.71]It's the same exact tool.
[135:02.70]That's from Mycelic Madness.
[135:04.57]He's using like a fucking golden globe to do this.
[135:07.98]What tool is this?
[135:09.26]That's the end of Gandalf's staff.
[135:12.97]A wizard cooks cookies precisely when he means to.
[135:18.16]Can I also say, too, those Lindt truffles
[135:21.51]are unbeatable.
[135:23.74]They're like the greatest candy ever made.
[135:26.05]I believe that guy.
[135:27.14]I think that guy actually is real because there's no way you make those that good.
[135:30.79]Are we gonna get DMCA'd?
[135:32.18]It says do not repost.
[135:34.37]From what, Vin Diesel or?
[135:35.50]No, Eldritch.
[135:37.46]Interesting.
[135:38.83]Should be alright.
[135:41.22]Ster, are you having a good time?
[135:43.25]Yeah.
[135:46.91]Do you want to do some more robbing?
[135:49.96]I'm really into this.
[135:51.90]They're mid as fuck.
[135:52.97]No, they are not.
[135:53.81]Okay, I want to poll the four of you.
[135:56.19]If you guys were to be chosen, if you had, like, what's his name?
[136:00.11]Morph, what's his name?
[136:01.43]The guy from, not Breaking Bad, the guy from Matrix.
[136:04.26]Morpheus?
[136:04.76]Morpheus comes up to you and he's holding out.
[136:07.00]He's like, in this hand I have a red milk chocolate lint truffle.
[136:11.90]And in this hand, I have any other chocolate on Earth.
[136:17.44]Who cares what it is?
[136:18.90]But it's covered in a blue wrapper.
[136:21.15]Which one are you?
[136:21.83]I'm picking the red one.
[136:22.82]I'm going right for the red Lindt truffle every time.
[136:25.52]No, Ferrero Rocher or just Nutella.
[136:28.76]Okay, if the other hand had a Ferrero Rocher and there was a red Lindt Truffle, it would be tough for me, I think.
[136:37.37]Or a little Nutella thingy with a fucking knife from the kitchen.
[136:43.34]Or my finger.
[136:43.92]I don't give a fuck.
[136:47.49]I don't know.
[136:48.80]I have to try one.
[136:50.43]I have to try one and then do a review of it.
[136:52.52]You've never had either one of these?
[136:54.90]I'm sure I've had it.
[136:56.10]I just don't, I can't recall the taste.
[136:57.43]I've had truffle.
[136:58.31]I don't know if I've had lint truffle.
[137:00.98]Ferrero Rocher is good.
[137:02.30]Rocherie is good.
[137:05.08]Yeah, he's never eaten a grocery.
[137:06.84]He's never fingered a Nutella thingy.
[137:09.33]How did Star die?
[137:11.92]Also, gear delis are really good too.
[137:15.05]Ghirardelli makes good... Yo, dog.
[137:17.63]I bought Ghirardelli brownie mix.
[137:20.77]that you make on your own, but with a brookie, like a cookie on top, and you make both.
[137:28.70]in the oven it's so good so good do you know what else is great
[137:34.86]Dude.
[137:35.56]Mods.
[137:36.45]Ban that guy.
[137:37.72]What is it?
[137:39.79]Mm-hmm.
[137:40.57]Not Keebler.
[137:41.35]Not the Keebler elf.
[137:42.30]The little elf fuckers.
[137:43.40]I'm talking... What's the... Not the Keebler elf.
[137:46.22]You'll grab that ladder, can you?
[137:48.02]I can't...
[137:50.32]I got it.
[137:51.16]Oh, it takes me off.
[137:52.09]Oh.
[137:55.12]What's it called?
[137:56.07]Is it... Who makes the... Is it Kinder?
[138:00.27]Dude, the old Kinder Eggs used to be so good.
[138:02.40]One kid died, they just ruined everything.
[138:04.71]Dude, Kinder... Just the generic, just general Kinder...
[138:09.13]Chocolate is amazing.
[138:11.94]With the toy in it, right?
[138:14.43]What, did he eat the toy?
[138:15.34]Well, it doesn't have to have a toy.
[138:16.71]No, I used to have a toy.
[138:17.59]Kinder Bueno.
[138:18.16]Yeah, Kinder Buenos are amazing.
[138:19.42]One kid died or something and then they made it like a weird dipping chocolate.
[138:23.40]Wait, that's your wrestling character in the prison game.
[138:27.88]Which one?
[138:28.40]No.
[138:29.93]Kinder Bueno?
[138:30.79]Kinder Buenos are really good.
[138:33.04]No.
[138:33.68]Oh, I'm sorry.
[138:34.06]You're talking about El Niño Bueno Malo.
[138:36.09]Of course.
[138:37.69]Alright, should we go?
[138:39.65]Yeah, I'm ready.
[138:40.37]My wrestler name is BustedBloodNut.
[138:42.88]This is why I suggested Hytale, because then we could literally do nothing.
[138:46.78]We're good.
[138:47.40]We just had, we got sidetracked for a second.
[138:48.77]We got time.
[138:49.27]We can do that.
[138:50.18]We can do whatever.
[138:51.38]Let's do one more of this and see where it goes.
[138:53.72]I am very happy we got to see the Vinny poop cookie escapade.
[138:57.19]I thought it was great.
[138:59.65]That would have never happened if we were not stealing.
[139:03.34]let's go well you mentioned air fryer and I I knew that was the right time to interject
[139:13.46]Dude, the craziest thing happened at the airport.
[139:17.17]Okay?
[139:18.38]Sounds like the setup to every comedy bit in the Comedy Cellar.
[139:22.25]I'm at the airport, right?
[139:23.67]Eight hours of delays, by the way, whatever.
[139:25.74]Oh, that sucks.
[139:26.42]Oh, that's horrible.
[139:27.38]Life sucks.
[139:28.06]And it was like by hour, you know what I mean?
[139:31.23]Hour delay.
[139:31.75]So it's not like a big boom.
[139:33.66]You get hit by the bait of, oh man, it's only going to be another 45 minutes.
[139:37.33]Yeah, that's awful.
[139:38.42]I've learned from the situation to just expect delays now and never be surprised.
[139:42.45]So it was nice.
[139:43.40]Anyways, I'm there.
[139:44.64]Six hours go by.
[139:46.41]The guy, you know, on the booth, he's like on the phone.
[139:48.72]You know what he said?
[139:49.43]Oh, we're in trouble.
[139:50.87]Are we dead?
[139:51.40]Are we dead?
[139:52.52]Guys?
[139:54.51]The police.
[139:54.90]I'm good.
[139:56.20]Don't worry about me.
[139:57.15]Alright, so what else happened?
[139:58.37]Okay, so he's on the phone, and you know what he says?
[140:01.79]He said this word for word.
[140:03.14]I swear to God, he said this.
[140:05.01]Looks like maintenance fixed the plane, apparently.
[140:08.35]He said apparently.
[140:09.92]Oh, no.
[140:11.02]He said the words apparently.
[140:13.21]Like, you know, maintenance did their thing, you know, apparently, so... Like, he was talking about, like...
[140:20.86]I don't know.
[140:21.36]Like real mechanical pipe.
[140:22.27]That would get the shit out of me.
[140:23.34]Yeah, that's terrifying.
[140:25.33]That's awful.
[140:27.19]I already have enough, like, okay, I'm not afraid to fly necessarily.
[140:31.72]Like I'm good.
[140:32.60]I went to Vegas.
[140:33.77]It's great.
[140:34.33]No problem.
[140:35.47]There's some delays, but the flight was great, both.
[140:39.12]But it's just, I don't like hearing shit like that.
[140:44.00]And I watched, oh God, I watched Nathan Fielder's show.
[140:48.23]what's the name of the show where he covers the plane stuff chat um I heard that one was good
[140:55.15]Dude, I was like, I'm never going on a plane because I have no faith in any human that flies a plane.
[141:03.03]That show ruined me.
[141:05.85]But then I forgot about it.
[141:07.42]Wait, it should have unruined you because the comedian literally successfully did it.
[141:12.11]He did the miracle over the Mojave, yes.
[141:14.26]But however, at the same time, I figured he didn't fix the social issues that go on within the cockpit.
[141:22.91]You can't break this one.
[141:24.40]Yeah, apparently the Venetian blinds make it so you need advanced thoughts to go in.
[141:31.85]I'm somewhat of an advanced thought.
[141:35.00]Alright, so this thing is gonna go off, right?
[141:37.49]Yeah.
[141:37.83]We've robbed this guy's house every day for two hours.
[141:40.97]Oh, no, no.
[141:41.46]It's just a trap right there.
[141:43.38]It's literally just that trap in front of you.
[141:45.03]Oh shit, okay.
[141:46.03]So maybe go through but try not to touch it?
[141:48.24]Cast a spell.
[141:49.83]I'll go.
[141:50.29]Alright, you go first.
[141:52.47]Nice, okay.
[141:53.96]Oh, that changes everything.
[141:55.57]Oh, hell yeah.
[141:56.20]Alright, that's so much better.
[141:57.17]Now we can take our time.
[142:01.55]There's a safe over here.
[142:03.16]What was that noise?
[142:04.72]I don't know.
[142:08.56]Homie's gonna be checking every one of these.
[142:13.03]Alright, we need a stethoscope for that one.
[142:19.33]Is that it for this one?
[142:20.98]I need a code.
[142:22.88]Alright, what's the code?
[142:25.45]If you put it wrong, do you think it goes off?
[142:27.90]Code?
[142:30.03]I don't know.
[142:30.37]Is the tire an old tire?
[142:35.76]Garage door, keypad, no.
[142:38.60]Alright, let's try the other ones.
[142:45.65]Oh, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming!
[142:52.81]Why can I not get on it?
[142:55.45]Oh my god, I didn't even care that I'm here.
[143:02.47]Dude, why?
[143:03.11]I got on this first try last time.
[143:05.01]Why can I not do it again?
[143:06.37]We need the tire.
[143:08.63]I had to get out.
[143:12.19]Cops are hopping around here.
[143:13.38]I think you can get it.
[143:25.56]Alright, I think we're okay.
[143:26.76]Oh, he's hearing you.
[143:27.44]Heard you.
[143:28.37]Alright, cops, drop around.
[143:30.94]You got the tire?
[143:32.29]No.
[143:32.91]Bring the tire over here.
[143:33.57]Oh, my God, he's wrapping around.
[143:36.36]Does he see me?
[143:37.41]Okay, throw the tire up here.
[143:39.03]I'll see if I can grab it.
[143:43.66]Can you toss it to me?
[143:49.82]Where'd it go?
[143:50.34]Oh my god, I got it.
[143:53.37]Okay, got it.
[143:56.71]Oh god, the cops coming this way.
[144:03.47]The goofiest criminals in the backyard.
[144:05.48]They're doing parkour, officer.
[144:09.12]They won't leave.
[144:09.79]They brought their own ladder.
[144:12.18]They got- they got my fucking old tire.
[144:14.67]Oh my god, dude.
[144:17.48]That worked.
[144:19.47]Oh my god.
[144:20.31]Okay, I'm out.
[144:21.58]You glitched the ladder through the wall like that.
[144:23.39]That was kind of amazing.
[144:25.26]It always works.
[144:28.63]When I'm playing.
[144:31.84]Okay, I think I'm safe.
[144:34.68]I got a big ass tire.
[144:39.28]Even if they chase me in here, I can't die.
[144:51.38]Summon me.
[144:53.45]This tire is going to be worth $30.
[144:55.52]Uh-oh.
[145:01.14]Did anybody drop anything valuable?
[145:02.18]You can climb up the front of the truck, I think.
[145:06.15]Do you guys drop anything valuable?
[145:08.22]In wherever you were, wherever you died?
[145:10.77]no wait I think I had some things on me I died in that first lady's house
[145:22.62]Oh my god!
[145:25.81]What was he doing?
[145:28.73]Oh, my God.
[145:29.83]Oh, my God.
[145:30.59]Oh, my God.
[145:32.14]I am being chased.
[145:33.47]I know.
[145:33.79]I sound like a fucking... Give me a break, dude.
[145:37.22]Give me a break.
[145:39.24]They're eating her, and then they're gonna eat me!
[145:41.05]Oh my god!
[145:44.85]I'm fuckin' dead.
[145:47.73]I'm dead.
[145:48.45]I'm dead, but I have a tire, so if I die, make sure to get the tire.
[145:51.28]He's pulling out a shotgun.
[145:53.16]What?
[145:55.33]He's got an RPG.
[145:58.58]Oh, do I love RPGs?
[146:00.04]You hit the button?
[146:07.07]No, I didn't.
[146:07.81]No.
[146:08.76]Oh, this is bad, guys.
[146:11.29]Run to the woods?
[146:12.85]Oh, shit.
[146:14.00]I fucked up.
[146:15.21]I forgot.
[146:15.77]I could just touch it.
[146:17.88]I forgot.
[146:18.88]I could just click the button.
[146:20.35]I forgot that you could do that.
[146:23.54]I completely forgot that you could press the fucking...
[146:26.87]I'm an idiot.
[146:27.39]I forgot.
[146:28.18]I could have just touched it.
[146:29.76]I just was hiding.
[146:30.75]Yeah, I'm an idiot.
[146:34.54]It's alright, we got a day.
[146:35.33]No one's arguing with you, man.
[146:37.24]It's fine.
[146:46.94]We got plenty of time.
[146:48.93]Yeah, we could do it.
[146:51.44]I don't know what the guy was doing in the house.
[146:54.35]because I walked over to his, he was on his hands.
[146:57.74]He was on his hands and knees crawling around.
[147:00.13]I don't know what the hell is he doing?
[147:10.09]Did he spill milk?
[147:14.54]Nightcrawlers, he was playing, Charlie, we gotta play Nightcrawlers.
[147:19.02]That's my favorite game.
[147:20.83]Okay.
[147:21.05]I'm seeing a lot of people in my chat say, it's his own house, dude.
[147:24.68]What do you care?
[147:25.33]Why are you mad at somebody?
[147:26.43]I told you guys that I put on sneakers and socks and was naked and was jumping around pretending to be Yoshi.
[147:30.75]And that's a weird thing to do.
[147:32.32]Why are you doing that?
[147:32.96]You shouldn't do that.
[147:34.10]And now all of a sudden you want to defend what people can do in their privacy of their own home.
[147:38.62]I'm sorry, what?
[147:41.53]all the sudden everybody wants to talk about the privacy of their own home when we were talking but I say that I put on his sneakers and socks
[147:48.30]It's weirder when you did that because I was there.
[147:51.31]Well, you wear shoes right now.
[147:55.64]Jerma, people don't want me to bake ever again.
[147:58.06]So...
[148:00.31]I mean, yeah, no, people are very concerned with other people's business.
[148:04.63]And it's honest, it's frankly shocking.
[148:06.66]I showed up to visit Germany.
[148:08.37]He was like, oh yeah, you agree people like in their private homes, like they can do whatever they want.
[148:11.84]Right.
[148:11.98]And I was like, yeah.
[148:12.79]And then he just started undressing.
[148:15.08]Did he jump up on the couch and he goes...
[148:18.29]Yes!
[148:20.35]That's such a fucked up picture.
[148:23.18]And he was like, dude, get on my back.
[148:25.41]And he started putting his tongue out as far as he could.
[148:31.11]What game are we on now?
[148:37.89]Oh, my God.
[148:39.36]What do you think, Sharp?
[148:40.83]I'm having a blast.
[148:43.02]I'm good for whatever you guys want to do.
[148:47.87]Yeah, this is cute.
[148:49.62]It's cute.
[148:50.35]Exactly.
[148:50.87]It's cute.
[148:54.12]What's Lunar's?
[148:57.55]uh I don't know something Vinny has suggested but Vinny doesn't know either so I don't even know what it is what do you mean I suggested lunars
[149:05.96]You did.
[149:06.69]That's why I put it on the list.
[149:09.30]I'm ruining my reputation?
[149:11.31]Oh, please, I don't care.
[149:12.97]What about Lort?
[149:14.20]I never played Lort.
[149:15.64]Lort needs work.
[149:17.51]I'm serious.
[149:19.68]I did, I played it.
[149:21.37]It's, you know what?
[149:24.05]let's play it one day that is not today trust me on this one give it give it another couple weeks
[149:29.74]I'm saying as a grown man should be able to put on sneakers and socks and braing hop around whenever he feels like it.
[149:36.11]Are we still talking about...
[149:37.73]My chat's freaking out.
[149:38.75]They're calling me all kinds of names.
[149:47.50]I'm on Gone Fishing.
[149:53.01]Alright, we could do, there's misery, there's this, there's, like I said, warp, he said it needs work.
[150:00.30]There's the choo-choo train game that's still linked.
[150:04.31]Seemed kind of cool.
[150:05.76]What's that one?
[150:06.93]very stressful unrailed we played that a long time ago the old one unreal is very stressful
[150:13.85]I would go from Misery or Hytale to narrow it down.
[150:16.76]I think both of those we would have fun with.
[150:20.06]Let's do Misery.
[150:20.66]I feel like that's the easiest to get going right now.
[150:24.17]Okay.
[150:26.42]Misery needs work.
[150:29.30]I feel like everybody agreed that Hytale would be fun and we're doing everything but play it.
[150:33.94]Yep.
[150:35.15]There's always a future opportunity for it.
[150:37.37]I'm down.
[150:39.02]Is that Hytale?
[150:40.69]Hytale Server is a bit of a process to start if you haven't looked into it at all.
[150:44.78]You can do a local.
[150:46.52]But that can lead to some lag.
[150:48.85]Oh, come on.
[150:49.37]Let's do Hamachi.
[150:51.50]Oh, my God.
[150:51.96]I remember that.
[150:52.58]You want to prepare?
[150:53.86]Get a server prepared and do that next time?
[150:56.64]I could do that, yeah.
[150:58.23]I'll find out if there's a way I can host mods and stuff, too, because I think people are making a lot of mods now.
[151:02.77]I know that makes Jerma not want to do it immediately, but... That's not true.
[151:08.42]Misery has open mics.
[151:10.01]Is there a way to disable that?
[151:19.83]Let's take a look.
[151:23.75]Alright, let's talk about cookies.
[151:25.72]So we're done here, right?
[151:27.94]Everybody wants to be my enemy.
[151:31.08]That was actually really fun.
[151:33.23]I like this game.
[151:34.23]I think it's very hard, but the right group of people that really try hard can do pretty well.
[151:39.35]Not us.
[151:42.51]Actually, I got to pee too.
[151:43.47]So let me open misery and then I'm going to go pee.
[151:45.30]So I'll be back in like two, three minutes.
[151:47.37]Be like 10 minutes ago.
[151:51.67]Is there a way to disable voice chat in this game?
[151:55.52]Like when you do multi-players, it's just the four of us or are there more people?
[152:00.99]I think it's just a local kind of co-op with whoever you want to play with.
[152:07.69]I think it's a one to like five or one to four or something.
[152:10.82]Oh, okay.
[152:11.36]Alright.
[152:11.66]So we should be good then.
[152:12.95]Let's find out.
[152:13.45]Alright.
[152:13.71]Yeah.
[152:13.95]Misery looks good.
[152:20.27]Hmm.
[152:23.97]I'm so sorry it's catchy
[152:36.91]Alright, I'm going to go pee.
[152:37.68]I'll be right back.
[152:38.99]You said that.
