[02:50.83]He's on the run.
[02:56.91]What?
[03:04.36]He's just...
[03:07.56]It looked like he tried to slide under the fence.
[03:10.05]He hit his head and died.
[03:26.34]Did you just call someone on the phone?
[03:31.58]Oh, God.

[04:21.47]Why is this the funniest thing I've ever seen?
[04:27.69]Come on, let's go.
[04:28.51]You think you can take me on?
[04:31.18]You're just a bully.
[04:33.06]Stay in there.
[04:34.46]For a second.
[04:37.08]Stay here?
[04:37.96]Yeah.
[04:39.52]Why am I staying in here?
[04:43.53]Oh, no.
[04:44.73]Okay.
[04:46.42]Hold on.
[04:47.24]Stay in there for a second.
[04:52.45]Stay in there for a second.
[04:53.49]Alright.
[04:57.05]Jerma, Jerma, I was never in there.
[04:59.57]No, you were.
[05:01.09]I was standing right next to you the whole time.
[05:05.35]Whoops.
[05:06.29]Oh, ow, ow!
[05:08.75]I'm dead.
[05:11.01]Are you fucking kidding me?
[05:15.60]Okay, that thing seems to be going well.
[05:21.23]He's knocking, he's coming.
[05:22.73]Here comes my super stealth patented ninja kick.
[05:26.94]Yes, I'm a badass.
[05:41.11]Why?
[05:41.99]Why?
[05:42.55]Why did I do that?
[05:43.87]I sat here and I did that.
[05:46.05]Okay, that's what you have to understand.
[05:48.19]The foliage is pretty fucking cool, dude.
[05:49.51]Oh, look at all those, oh, there's like a bunch of birds.
[05:51.23]First impression.
[05:52.29]First impression of the birds, uh, they're pretty cool.
[05:54.73]First impression of the zombies, a little bit buttery on the hit there.
[05:57.66]A little bit buttery.
[06:00.22]And a little bit cream cheesy.
[06:01.40]Uh, you know, first impression of the zombie, cream cheese.
