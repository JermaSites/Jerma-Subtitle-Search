[00:08.51]Dark Carnival, you must be this tall to die.
[00:13.61]Oh, yeah, baby.
[00:15.80]Obviously, you can see... That makes me giggle every single time.
[00:17.46]We're in here with Boo, Burgah Boy, of course, MLC_St3alth, who is freaking out with a glitch.
[00:23.30]This is our survival, so... We're just jumping right into this here.
[00:27.54]I have no idea if we're going to do this or not.
[00:29.97]Boo, are you going to throw that fire ammo on the ground?
[00:32.09]What is a strategy?
[00:35.08]I'm saying we climb up on this here thing over here.
[00:38.62]Boo, toss down your ammo.
[00:39.54]Hang out on top here.
[00:40.44]And go get a health kit.
[00:42.26]Yeah, make sure you have, like, health and pills and boom-a-bile and puke and pee.
[00:46.94]Ooh, puke.
[00:48.48]I love puke.
[00:50.06]Alright, nobody pick up the grenade launcher.
[00:51.50]That's going to be bad.
[00:54.78]Meat burger.
[00:57.01]Hello, everyone.
[00:58.45]No, I was... I was, like, reading that.
[01:03.89]Oh, hello, everyone.
[01:06.40]I was reading that sign that says Mead Burger.
[01:08.86]Yeah, this is, like, the first time Burgah Boy's been in a video, I think.
[01:12.14]I'm trying to jump on top of the corn dog.
[01:13.36]Alright, so they mean you're ready?
[01:14.16]Okay, cool.
[01:15.44]Do we have the little gasket?
[01:16.74]Oh, never mind.
[01:17.54]Everyone hang out up here.
[01:20.37]Where did the zombies come from?
[01:22.53]You were... Oh, God, that was... Oh, my God.
[01:26.56]Spitter, spitter across the way.
[01:28.12]We're already like dead.
[01:29.40]No, we're not.
[01:30.00]Yeah, I've already fallen off.
[01:34.16]It's alright.
[01:34.88]I'm like on fire.
[01:35.92]We just got four minutes, that's it.
[01:39.70]Yeah, I'm saving that.
[01:41.55]I'm coming back up.
[01:43.37]I'm up.
[01:44.09]There's pills up here, so heal up and grab some pills.
[01:47.53]Boom-a-bile.
[01:52.29]Oh, we just need to, if we survive four minutes, we're super MLG pros.
[01:55.73]Oh my god.
[01:56.09]I got you, I got you.
[01:57.35]I don't like this.
[01:59.29]Get off of my bread.
[02:00.41]Oh, charge.
[02:00.95]Get out of here.
[02:03.00]Oh, that didn't take long.
[02:03.88]Bergaboo, Bergaboo, you're almost dead.
[02:06.94]You need to heal, bro.
[02:10.32]Burning sensation.
[02:11.26]Look at me, just achievements all around.
[02:13.38]Oh, you're getting a bunch of achievements right now?
[02:16.72]By all around, I mean one.
[02:18.36]Whoa.
[02:19.98]That just destroyed me.
[02:20.80]Yeah, we gotta be careful of the spitters, man.
[02:22.40]The spitter's gonna spit up here, and we're gonna be all done.
[02:25.62]Oh, you mean like that?
[02:26.50]Except he missed.
[02:27.04]Thankfully he missed.
[02:27.66]Oh, it was a tank.
[02:28.04]Oh my god, I was just unloading on your back, dude.
[02:29.93]I'm sorry.
[02:31.29]Tank.
[02:31.71]Oh, he's throwing a rock.
[02:32.73]Tank, where is he?
[02:33.77]Ow.
[02:34.33]There he is.
[02:34.69]Unload on him.
[02:35.27]He has to climb up here.
[02:36.01]He has to climb up here.
[02:36.77]Just destroy him.
[02:38.95]Alright, get up.
[02:39.81]Oh, man.
[02:40.15]That didn't take him too long, did it?
[02:42.03]There's a hunter around, too.
[02:43.21]Be careful.
[02:44.87]He's going down.
[02:45.61]He's down.
[02:46.21]Tank dead?
[02:46.79]Tank dead?
[02:47.53]Oh, god.
[02:48.26]Get this.
[02:49.66]Oh, I got a jockey on me.
[02:51.50]Oh, and a charger, too.
[02:52.20]Are you kidding me?
[02:54.35]I'm over here screwed.
[02:55.81]Oh, shoot.
[02:56.61]I'm trying to get to you.
[02:57.79]Boomer and a charger.
[03:01.95]Oh, God.
[03:02.85]Oh, God.
[03:04.77]Take your pills if you have them.
[03:08.07]Yeah, good throw.
[03:08.95]Good throw.
[03:09.39]Good toss.
[03:11.06]Are you dead?
[03:11.74]I'm lying down right here on the ground.
[03:16.60]Oh, come on, Burgah Boy.
[03:18.55]Hey, a tank again.
[03:19.51]Oh my god.
[03:21.29]Wow.
[03:25.07]I'll try to save you, Jerma.
[03:26.39]You just got launched so far on my screen.
[03:31.56]I'll get him.
[03:32.10]Don't worry.
[03:32.64]He's going down.
[03:33.64]Burgah Boy, you are like the master of this game.
[03:38.22]Alright, come on.
[03:38.74]Come on.
[03:39.42]I'll be the bait.
[03:40.10]I'm going down.
[03:40.66]I'm dead.
[03:42.26]I'm done.
[03:42.64]Another minute and a half.
[03:43.46]Come on.
[03:43.96]You guys can do it.
[03:46.93]Oh, if anybody can... If we can get rid of that tank, if somebody picks up the defibs.
[03:52.50]Oh, dear lord.
[03:53.34]Chalky.
[03:56.38]Oh, very good boy.

[04:06.51]Hey, revive me, ML.
[04:08.33]ML.
[04:10.17]Oh, my charger.
[04:12.21]Oh, Hunter.
[04:13.19]Yeah, that's the end of me.
[04:14.25]No, no, no, no.
[04:16.32]Stell, it's up to you.
[04:17.34]Oh, you got Burgah Boy?
[04:18.24]Nice.
[04:20.16]Burgah Boy got a hunter on him.
[04:21.80]And a spitter right there.
[04:22.60]Spitter right behind you guys.
[04:24.86]Tank.
[04:25.46]Oh, dear.
[04:28.51]Deary, deary me.
[04:30.31]Oh, come on.
[04:30.55]I'm coming in all kinds of spit here.

[04:35.25]Ow, ow, ow.
[04:35.87]Oh, man.
[04:36.71]Oh, Stell, have you... Oh, there's a hunter coming.
[04:38.55]Run around in circles.
[04:41.10]Alright, alright.
[04:41.92]Good first attempt.
[04:42.88]We almost made it.
[04:43.88]Charge is coming for ya.
[04:45.88]That's it, that's all she wrote.
[04:47.64]Three and a half.
[04:48.64]God damn it.
[04:49.24]Hey, none of us has it at best time, so... I'm terrified.
[04:55.90]Me too.
[04:56.28]Hang in that corner.
[04:57.42]There's a jogger right here.
[04:58.32]Let's go over to our left right here, too.
[05:00.12]Oh, God.
[05:01.00]Smoker has... Oh, never mind, it failed.
[05:03.02]Alright, just get in this corner.
[05:05.20]Oh, man, I'm already... You're good, you're good, you're good.
[05:08.36]Whoa.
[05:10.02]Yes, alright.
[05:11.38]Hop in this corner, this is it.
[05:13.86]When a tank comes, we can deal with it.
[05:16.60]I'm tanking my bio.
[05:23.65]Yeah, when a tank comes, we can... Alright, this is much better.
[05:26.31]Smoke it right there, smoke it straight ahead.
[05:28.73]And an idiot that just fell.
[05:31.87]Alright, look at this.
[05:33.05]Spitter up top on the... Oh, that spitter's gonna get us.
[05:36.37]No, she's not.
[05:37.01]Jock is coming to our left.
[05:39.49]Straight ahead.
[05:42.96]Tank!
[05:43.32]Alright, this is where we start to move around.
[05:45.48]Boom-a-bile, I'm throwing it the other way.
[05:47.98]Throw it on him.
[05:49.66]Oh, I'm an idiot.
[05:50.78]Hey, hunter, heads up.
[05:54.94]Sorry, just focus on the tank.
[05:56.46]Spinner.
[05:59.00]Tank should be almost dead.
[06:02.56]Hunter's dead.
[06:03.58]Run, Jerma.
[06:04.24]Sorry.
[06:04.50]Tank's dead, tank's dead.
[06:05.42]Regroup.
[06:05.99]Tank's dead.
[06:08.51]Hey, jockey.
[06:10.02]Oh, watch out for the Draco.
[06:12.10]Charger.
[06:13.80]Whatever.
[06:15.38]Alright, back in the corner, back in the corner.
[06:17.04]Oh, is it... Oh, I've been jogging, jogging.
[06:18.50]There's somebody back here.
[06:19.24]Thanks.
[06:19.48]Alright, good, good.
[06:22.30]Good.
[06:22.52]Alright, this is the best we've done so far.
[06:25.97]No one's, like, running around aimlessly in circles dying.
[06:29.81]Just about out of ammo, though.
[06:31.17]Yeah, we're gonna have to make a team ammo run in a second here.
[06:35.22]You guys want to do it?
[06:36.30]After the next team.
[06:37.08]Get the ammo.
[06:38.34]No, actually, yeah, where's the ammo?
[06:39.36]Let's just go as a team.
[06:40.50]I just need the shotgun right here.
[06:41.90]Oh, a smoker, I heard.
[06:42.96]A spitter, actually.
[06:43.50]Alright, go back in the corner, back in the corner.
[06:45.16]Bruma!
[06:47.14]Back in that good old corner.
[06:48.62]Hunter.
[06:50.52]Oh, God, he got right on me.
[06:52.57]There's a tank coming.
[06:54.71]Oh, dear Lord, right next to us, right behind us.
[06:57.71]He got behind us, he climbed up behind us.
[07:00.29]Holy shit, he's right there.
[07:02.51]I threw a Molotov on you guys, I apologize.
[07:05.19]Somebody want to watch my back for one second?
[07:07.78]Oh, jeez.
[07:08.70]Oh, I got charged.
[07:09.48]Watch my back for one second.
[07:11.06]No, I'm going to go down.
[07:11.88]Let's charge her.
[07:12.62]Come on, come on.
[07:14.22]I can't believe I got that off.
[07:16.68]Oh, charge her down, man.
[07:18.10]Oh, come on.
[07:19.18]Tank's right behind me.
[07:20.90]I'm done.
[07:21.96]Oh, my God.
[07:23.22]We were doing so good.
[07:24.68]We have to do another.
[07:25.54]We can't end it on that.
[07:26.71]That was a good strategy.
[07:29.37]We didn't even make it to the...
[07:32.01]Oh my god, like where did that charger come from?
[07:34.51]We just got our ass warped.
