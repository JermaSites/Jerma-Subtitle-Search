[00:19.83]Good morning.
[00:20.71]How are you?
[00:23.76]Hey.
[00:27.38]Gonna be playing some Supermarket together today.
[00:34.51]Joined by Mr. Poke and Vinny.
[00:49.29]I thought this day would never come.
[00:50.55]Oh, a playing game.
[00:52.68]What do you mean?
[00:53.66]Supermarket simulator.
[00:54.66]Whatever this is.
[00:55.10]Supermarket together.
[00:56.06]It looks like they're already in a call.
[01:05.94]And I don't want to be late.
[01:08.31]Yeah, we're going to play this for a few hours.
[01:10.33]There's a couple of games we were going to play.
[01:12.69]This is one of them.
[01:14.08]You may see more than one game.
[01:15.56]We might play this for a few hours.
[01:18.08]We'll see.
[01:18.88]I have no idea.
[01:28.17]There's already mad at you.
[01:29.26]I didn't.
[01:29.54]What did I do?
[01:30.18]I didn't do anything.
[01:37.43]Are you the gaming wizard of Las Vegas?
[01:43.80]I don't think so.
[01:51.97]The four retail men.
[01:56.36]Yeah.
[01:56.48]Hey, my cat missed you.
[02:02.20]Aww.
[02:02.45]Do you tell Mr. Snuffles that I said hi?
[02:06.29]Hi.
[02:17.28]Mr. Snuffles is his father's name.
[02:19.88]Oh, okay.
[02:24.74]My cat is hissing at the screen.
[02:25.99]You know, I saw a video today.
[02:28.25]It was a video.
[02:29.43]I just... I don't know.
[02:31.23]Got to recommend it to me.
[02:33.17]It was a video of a mongoose.
[02:34.89]Just like... Or was it on Reddit?
[02:36.50]I don't know.
[02:38.00]It was a video of a mongoose just like going after a lion.
[02:41.34]Just freaking out and screaming at a lion.
[02:43.28]And the lion is like, get away from me.
[02:45.03]I don't... What are you?
[02:46.96]It's like .
[02:49.62]Mongooses are crazy.
[02:50.76]They have absolutely no fear.
[03:02.74]Isn't the thing with the mongoose, they only operate at 100.
[03:06.92]There is no in between.
[03:08.00]They're either asleep or they're operating at 100.
[03:19.21]They eat snakes.
[03:20.21]Aren't they so fast that even with a slow motion camera you still can't see how fast they are?
[03:31.43]They're that fast.
[03:38.88]They break the sound barrier.
[03:50.95]I feel like I'm taking... Okay, one... You know the five things are chasing you and the others are protecting you meme?
[04:04.65]If a mongoose is up there, I think I'm picking a mongoose to be one of the protectors.
[04:09.22]I don't think I want a mongoose coming after me.
[04:15.76]You know the one where it's like, oh, you pick one from each row.
[04:19.66]The others are coming after you.
[04:22.15]And it's like Thanos, the Joker.
[04:24.94]Like Mary Poppins.
[04:26.38]They list all these characters.
[04:28.25]It's like, which one are you picking to defend you?
[04:50.47]How much CBD oil did you have today?
[04:53.49]I, I, I, okay.
[04:55.03]You guys, I gotta, I gotta tell you.
[04:57.70]I have, I have not had any cannabis products or marijuana in like seven months.
[05:04.15]I'm, I'm completely sober.
[05:08.58]I've had a few bush lights, but that's it.
[05:10.74]And that cranberry vodka night.
[05:20.98]this is how you just are DVD is nice though why bush if you need to ask me why I choose the clean crisp delicious bubbly taste
[05:50.17]Of a bush light.
[05:52.27]I don't think I need to.
[05:54.46]I mean, what is going on right now?
[05:57.06]Do I really have to do that?
[06:06.74]The last time I drank a bush light was the last time you saw me drink a bush light, which was like four months ago.
[06:13.99]Whatever it was.
[06:15.52]In fact, there's still there are three bush lights in my fridge right now that are just sitting there from the last time I bought them a lot.
[06:22.83]Those things are probably fucking dank.
[06:30.49]Alright, let me join this call.
[06:32.08]We're playing Four Horsemen Supermarket together.
[06:34.78]Welcome to the stream.
[06:37.24]Welcome to the video.
[06:39.46]Let's see what's going on here.
[06:42.60]Hello.
[06:44.70]Hey, I have the game server ready.
[06:47.39]I am the alpha.
[06:48.49]I am so prepped.
[06:50.45]Oh, okay.
[06:51.35]I'm just going to have to join a friend on Steam.
[06:53.80]Vinny said he's going to match your energy today.
[06:56.78]Wait, Vinny said he's going to match my energy?
[06:59.25]Yeah, he said one to one.
[07:01.63]Okay, so let's do an experiment then.
[07:03.65]I'm going to be super low.
[07:04.99]I'm going to be super mellow.
[07:06.24]Let's see what he does.
[07:06.80]That's what he always does.
[07:12.20]He's not.
[07:12.68]Vinny's energetic all the time.
[07:14.08]What are you talking about?
[07:21.13]Okay.
[07:21.99]Why are you talking shit about one of our friends who's currently muted?
[07:26.13]I already talked to him.
[07:27.25]I was in here early.
[07:28.98]It's a whole callback.
[07:31.02]You don't know.
[07:31.56]Okay.
[07:33.60]If you show up like 20 minutes early, you can't be mad at people showing up 20 minutes later than you, which is the time.
[07:40.17]You're getting mad at me.
[07:41.66]hey alright alright alright alright well let me just alright let's do it you ready what happened we're getting mad at each other no I'm just chilling I'm just hanging out alright because I'll match the energy like if you guys are angry
[07:58.76]Alright, well, then we can't do that joke anymore.
[08:01.14]Alright, Vinny, I was going to just be so low and not... I was going to just kind of talk like this and just see what you did.
[08:07.83]Because he said that you were going to match my energy.
[08:09.71]He leaked a conversation, a private conversation between the two of you.
[08:13.24]And he got mad at me for saying that you would be chill and match his energy.
[08:16.46]Why are we fighting?
[08:17.98]Exactly.
[08:18.74]That's what I'm saying.
[08:19.71]I'm matching Polk's energy today.
[08:21.09]We need to fight the others.
[08:23.95]We need to fight the...
[08:26.57]But right now, here's what happens when I joined the call.
[08:31.04]Me and Ster did the same bit.
[08:32.36]It's like, hey, hey, how you doing?
[08:33.52]How you doing, man?
[08:34.00]What's up?
[08:34.70]That was the bit.
[08:35.36]It was a manic bit.
[08:36.56]And he did it and I did it.
[08:37.83]And then I was like, I can't do that anymore.
[08:39.39]I have to lower the energy.
[08:41.51]And then I realized, I think that's just kind of me most of the time.
[08:44.94]Am I like too cool for school, guys?
[08:47.74]Like, do I need to work on that?
[08:49.77]No.
[08:50.23]Hold on.
[08:51.13]I accidentally just put this on.
[08:52.67]Vinny, you're just you.
[08:55.08]You don't have to take yourself to the Build-A-Bear workshop.
[08:57.36]You were already made perfect.
[08:59.80]Wow.
[09:00.99]What the fuck?
[09:01.77]What about me and Poke?
[09:02.87]What about me and Poke?
[09:04.27]Me and Poke don't have the big, beautiful hearts in there?
[09:09.56]Poke is perfect.
[09:11.41]You need work.
[09:12.49]What do you mean?
[09:13.78]yeah what you agreed poke you just agreed poke you're supposed to be like you're supposed to be in my corner on these things I don't mean we've been talking a lot but I mean what's the plan today guys I have these I don't know maybe I'll do something else we could do a supermarket because you know we already did a water park uh separately so we could do that alright let's do this I play water park I like water park it was good

[10:18.76]The last time I posted a game, it was like a shooter thingy.

[10:41.25]Oh, man.
[10:42.39]Vinny and Jerma, you both played a digging game recently.
[10:46.01]What did I play?
[10:46.47]What brings you back to the hole?
[10:50.20]That's the question.
[10:51.06]If anyone could answer, they'd be a millionaire.
[10:53.42]It's just the never-ending... There's always... Hey, look, you can dig as much as you want.
[10:59.15]There'll always be more.
[11:00.07]Why do you think Minecraft got so popular?
[11:01.45]There's always more to dig.
[11:03.07]There's always more diamonds to explore.
[11:05.47]There's always more caves to look at.
[11:09.52]Digging is so in right now.
[11:11.72]Yeah, digging in games, you have Donkey Kong, you just dig, the whole game was sold on that premise, the new one.
[11:18.71]So it's, yeah.
[11:19.75]Can you believe they made a DLC already?
[11:22.62]Is it Donkey Kong DLC?
[11:24.64]Yeah, yeah, 20 bucks.
[11:26.34]What?
[11:26.54]Donkey Kong?
[11:27.20]Didn't it come out like three weeks ago?
[11:31.49]It came out two months ago, and yeah, the DLC is kind of not great for 20 bucks.
[11:36.56]It should be like 5 to 10, yeah.
[11:38.58]Oh, shit.
[11:40.22]Yeah, yeah.
[11:43.04]Alright, but we're in the supermarket game.

[11:47.69]We can play this for a little bit.
[11:48.63]We'll see how it is.
[11:49.27]If we want to do the digging thing, we can do the digging thing.
[11:51.78]If we want to do something else, I'm game for whatever.
[11:54.68]We can do whatever you guys want.
[11:56.17]I'm here for whatever.

[12:13.28]That is not feasible.
[12:16.14]Jackbox Party Pack, like we said last time, which is a real game.

[12:20.83]Alright, well, let's do this.
[12:21.69]So you have a code?
[12:25.27]I think you just have to join on friend on Steam.

[14:28.63]We have to go to the... This is weird people.
[14:30.87]Alright, with the store... I do not like this uncanny character face guy.
[14:35.71]Yeah, I have a feeling he's not a real person anyway, like I feel like most of this game isn't real Why does it look so weird?
[14:43.74]I would prefer asset flips.
[14:45.06]What is this?
[14:46.26]This is scary.
[14:46.86]I don't know.
[14:48.03]I don't know.

[15:08.36]Holy shit, no wonder I still want to play this.
[15:10.42]Look at this, Path to Exile back here.
[15:13.49]Wait, what?
[15:13.89]What is it?
[15:17.27]What do you mean?
[15:17.87]You're acting like I suggested the game now.
[15:21.96]Yeah, this was recommended to me.
[15:24.04]Oh, oh God, oh God, huge skill tree.
[15:26.31]What the fuck?
[15:26.83]Dude, where's extra lightning damage?
[15:28.27]I put a point into bread.
[15:30.33]Ster, what does it mean if there is a plus and then there's multiply, right?
[15:35.14]I don't know.
[15:35.62]What does that mean?
[15:36.26]Something else different, doesn't it?
[15:37.44]Additive versus multiplicative?
[15:41.05]This is too deep of a dive for right now.
[15:43.25]And bleed damage is bad because it ticks it differently.
[15:45.55]And poison is it don't do poison, right?
[15:48.00]Oh, my God.
[15:48.28]I'm already getting stressed out from this game.
[15:50.02]Alright.
[15:52.48]Well, the bread is poison damage.
[15:54.50]right but you said you recommend that I don't start with poison because it's kind of hard it's complicated to like explain the water bottle is bleed because you can hurt your lips on the bottle okay we do we do razor blade corrosive which one is corrosive how about I got a checkout alright tab to buy we I think we share money so we have to be we have to be collectively know where we want to do with these what kind of store is this
[16:19.41]um fruits and vegetables okay you want to just keep it simple alright that's that's good you talk like that's so stupid oh alright we want to be very simple about it I guess yeah we can only do god you guys god you guys god you guys alright well somebody has to be the manager because we can't just make random decisions who's the manager I think it should be me
[16:49.65]Okay.
[16:52.17]Wow.
[16:52.95]Yeah, I'm fine with that.
[16:54.39]I don't need to manage.
[16:55.55]I don't need to manage.
[16:56.45]Anybody else?
[16:57.08]You got something to say?
[16:59.38]Ster, you can be the second in command, and me and Vinny will smoke cigarettes outside.
[17:06.59]I'm not kidding.
[17:07.37]That's how I started smoking cigarettes 20 years ago, was because I worked at an Eckerd, which is like a Walgreens, and one of my coworkers was like, dog, I know how to steal cigarettes.
[17:17.70]You want one?
[17:18.81]and one day like three months in for no reason I was like yeah I'll have one I didn't even smoke and then I did for 10 years oh no real story yeah it's a pretty bad one did you that's how they get the manager's approval of this shelf does the manager read the top right buy two product shelves a checkout and a storage alright you go ahead and make another one
[17:46.23]we can't change our shirt at all we're the same it's because the game is free and they sell like cosmetic options as they're like wait this game was free wasn't it this game was free yeah it was free oh I told my dad not to buy it meanwhile it's free wait they have a DLC called the cool pack what oh I'm doing it I want a cool cash are you sure no they have eight characters 10 100 hats wow
[18:14.78]Alright, well, now that you say 100 hats, how could you refuse?
[18:19.24]I'm putting the checkout over here.
[18:23.69]I approve of that.
[18:24.97]Right here?
[18:25.99]Hey, manager?
[18:27.43]No, it should be near the exit.
[18:29.31]Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I do think that the checkout usually is by the exit.
[18:34.16]But like right here?
[18:34.94]Type 1.
[18:37.24]Right here?
[18:40.28]No.
[18:41.79]Here, I'll be your... Where do you want it, manager?
[18:45.14]I'll be the advisor.
[18:46.12]You can do whatever you want.
[18:47.74]Oh my god.
[18:48.77]What?
[18:49.73]I just... I don't know.
[18:51.07]Someone's face is real weird.
[18:55.74]Yeah, I don't like that.
[18:56.82]It's fine.
[18:57.38]It's fine.
[18:57.90]It's fine.
[18:58.41]Okay, let's...
[19:05.56]Did you guys pet the cat yet?
[19:07.12]This place is not big enough to have a checkout counter like this.
[19:10.82]Get rid of this.
[19:11.46]You need to put them all the way down here so people have to walk as far as possible.
[19:15.25]Oh, I crashed.
[19:17.03]Rejoining.
[19:19.99]Poke, I swear to God.
[19:22.55]Poke.
[19:25.38]Hey, Ster, can you come over here for a minute and tell me what's happening in here?
[19:29.46]What is here?
[19:31.81]What's going on over here?
[19:32.76]Why do I feel like this is bad?
[19:33.96]No, this is fucking wrong.
[19:35.60]Whatever.
[19:36.54]Somebody will fix it.
[19:39.84]Only poke is going to be allowed in there.
[19:41.99]Oh, my God.
[19:42.99]You're right.
[19:45.79]Did you pet the cat?
[19:47.39]Where's the cat?
[19:48.90]Right here.
[19:52.40]We need like a product shelf.
[19:55.14]Oh, my God.
[19:55.64]This is awful.
[19:56.57]Two product shelves, a checkout and a storage shelf.
[19:59.13]We have a storage shelf, right?
[20:01.68]Yeah, we got a storage.
[20:03.17]We have two product shelves.
[20:06.19]We need product shelves.
[20:07.69]There should be two here.
[20:08.41]And this should be it, right?
[20:12.90]Oh, wait.
[20:13.16]The storage shelf can only be placed in the annex empty room.
[20:16.08]So that was wrong.
[20:19.19]Does this count as the annex?
[20:21.05]I think it has to be over there.
[20:22.81]It's over here, manager.
[20:26.03]This is where we annex.
[20:28.73]Okay, so here we go.
[20:30.68]Don't take a Xanax.
[20:32.02]There, bingo.
[20:32.94]Boom.
[20:34.00]Alright, great.
[20:34.40]Just acquired the first pack of products.
[20:35.64]It's important to remember that once you've acquired a product franchise, customers will expect those products to be in the store or they will complain about existences.
[20:42.53]Now go to the manager blackboard, click in it, and then click in the products order.
[20:47.83]Is Pope okay?
[20:49.89]He's buying DLC.
[20:52.80]Oh, right here, guys.
[20:53.82]Sorry, I'm in the cool room.
[20:55.75]What?
[20:57.43]Alright, so here we go.
[20:59.22]What do you guys want to order?
[21:03.56]Could you believe it?
[21:04.26]That's the way they get people to buy DLC.
[21:06.47]How about pasta, water, honey cereal, rice, salt, and sugar.
[21:11.07]That's all we can do.
[21:14.14]Apparently I can put YouTube videos on the TV for us.
[21:17.50]Really?
[21:18.92]We have Jerma.
[21:20.20]Turn around.
[21:21.83]Check out the board.
[21:23.07]I just bought $200 worth of salt.
[21:25.92]We can allocate more points for our various things we can sell.
[21:32.89]But I think we could be a salt salesman.
[21:35.07]Yep.
[21:39.96]Oh, this is so weird.
[21:41.86]I think they're making us.
[21:43.68]Alright, where do we get the salt?
[21:46.73]Go outside and look for the purchased boxes.
[21:49.95]Purchased boxes?
[21:51.83]Get away from this.
[21:54.20]Oh, fuck.
[21:54.62]I bought way too much.
[21:56.20]I wish this was oh my god Jerma there's so many boxes I bought a lot I bought way too much I spent almost almost all of our money work sorry salt I wish this was a water park simulator alright here we go I'm gonna put the stock on the shelf okay go to a product shelf and click left mouse on one of its rows to fill it with products you hold the mouse button alright where are we putting the salt this is how we sell poke why are you the pope

[22:53.42]hold the button and it'll create multiple rows of salt.
[22:57.05]How do you draw?
[22:57.75]Oh, F. Do we have to throw stuff away?
[23:00.19]Oh my God, fuck this.
[23:02.63]Let's just eat here.
[23:03.96]Okay, I got a bunch of salt on the shelves.
[23:08.90]That's good.
[23:13.17]It will complain about existences.
[23:14.95]What does that mean?
[23:16.25]Oh, I see it.
[23:17.00]I think we need the price gun thing.
[23:18.98]Go to the manager room and take one of the pricing devices.
[23:24.50]This thing right here?
[23:26.91]Are we overselling or underselling?
[23:29.57]Here we go.
[23:32.25]Do 44 cents.
[23:34.82]Should we do it?
[23:35.46]What do you think, 43?
[23:37.36]I can't make it more expensive.
[23:40.82]You have to mouse, like, get near it, and then you can scroll wheel up.
[23:45.17]So we can do 62 cents.
[23:48.19]Oh, this is a sale sign.
[23:49.63]Oh, fuck.
[23:50.43]Hold on.
[23:53.02]It will affect all salt in the building.
[23:55.55]Oh, here it is.
[23:56.13]Okay.
[24:01.12]What the fuck?
[24:03.58]I think we make it 50 cents.
[24:06.07]Click left click.
[24:13.29]Okay, is it weird if we have salt over here for 50 cents and then you made it?
[24:17.14]Okay, just make sure it's the premium salt.
[24:20.12]We sell premium salt.
[24:22.08]And also the cheap salt.
[24:24.79]Okay.
[24:25.39]You can also set prices with your numpad.
[24:27.07]Alright.
[24:28.53]We're good.
[24:28.93]Alright.
[24:34.36]Now what?
[24:36.88]Good we open
[24:40.41]I opened the supermarket.
[24:42.07]Oh, shit.
[24:43.02]Alright.
[24:46.47]There's gambling outside.
[24:47.89]This is a money laundering establishment, by the way.
[24:50.38]There's no way this is real.
[24:52.25]Polk, how much did you spend on the DLC?
[24:54.74]Sixty bucks.
[24:55.66]No, I'm kidding.
[24:56.06]Five bucks.
[24:56.44]Oh, fuck.
[24:56.66]This guy wants... We gotta get more.
[24:58.02]This guy just came to me personally.
[25:00.52]And he said, hey, dude, I want more stuff.
[25:02.65]He's like, where's the pasta?
[25:03.77]Green tea, lemon tea, lemon... There's salt.
[25:09.18]There's salt.
[25:09.56]Who is this guy?
[25:10.18]There's salt.
[25:11.20]If you want to buy salt, we have salt.
[25:13.52]That's all we have.
[25:14.88]Wait, is he gonna get it?
[25:17.53]He just left?
[25:18.87]Wait, why are we closed?
[25:19.99]Why is it closed?
[25:22.29]No, it's open.
[25:23.57]It says open now for me.
[25:24.59]It's weird.
[25:25.32]Yeah.
[25:27.24]Can we have a shelf that doesn't have salt on it?
[25:28.80]We don't have enough light on the salt.
[25:32.68]Oh!
[25:33.77]I just hit this guy and he's calling the police.
[25:36.17]What do you mean he's calling the police?
[25:37.31]I hit this guy.
[25:37.83]I hit him in the head with a broom and he said police.
[25:43.42]Is he alright?
[25:45.08]Seems to be okay.
[25:46.10]He's got no reaction on his face.
[25:47.36]It's going to take a long time for the cops to get here because there's no cars in this universe.
[25:51.82]Yeah, there's just salt.
[25:54.59]Don't you, like, control the machine?
[25:55.99]There's only salt.
[25:56.89]Alright, we need to buy stuff.
[25:57.91]We gotta buy stuff.
[25:58.57]This is our first day ever.
[26:01.26]Yeah.

[26:56.18]Fuck.
[26:58.85]Wait, why do we have the cash?
[26:59.77]Why are we still split apart?
[27:03.53]Wait, I gotta give this guy money.
[27:07.63]They are way too split up.
[27:10.86]Okay, give you 1, 2, 3, 4, and then 50 cents.
[27:15.50]It's like we're dueling.
[27:18.52]I can't put this food anywhere because everywhere there is salt.
[27:21.90]What the fuck is this?
[27:22.48]This guy gave me a credit card.
[27:26.29]I think I just charged this guy $5,000 on his credit card.
[27:29.99]How do I... What does it want me to do?
[27:41.30]Why can't I add the thing?
[27:46.81]It says 50 cents.
[27:47.65]50 cents.
[27:49.11]Do I have to zoom into this?
[27:51.65]Dude, have you ever worked?
[27:53.78]I can't click this.
[27:55.10]I'm telling you.
[27:55.66]Look.
[27:56.16]I'm trying to click it.
[27:57.12]It won't let me do it.
[28:00.57]You're going to get fired.
[28:01.57]Wait until corporate shows up.
[28:03.61]You hit a guy?
[28:04.24]There's only a comma.
[28:06.52]I can't click the comma first.
[28:08.00]Look.
[28:08.94]I'm spamming it.
[28:11.69]All I can charge him is $50.
[28:12.69]Anybody want to work here?
[28:16.98]Who wants to work?
[28:18.46]Guys, when you empty a box, you have to put it in the dumpster.
[28:21.09]Don't just put it back outside.
[28:23.21]Dude, I wanted to just do the decimal first.
[28:24.83]Why can't I do decimal first?
[28:30.12]This point of sale system is fucking trash.
[28:33.64]We're making good... Oh, I was going to say, I thought... We're only selling salt.
[28:39.39]Cha-ching!
[28:39.71]Cha-ching!
[28:41.55]You guys hear that?
[28:42.41]I'm stocking other things.
[28:44.85]What should I do?
[28:45.65]I don't know what I should be doing.
[28:46.93]It's your turn.
[28:47.54]Come take my shift.
[28:50.48]I unlocked cheese.
[28:52.06]Okay, I'm ready.
[28:52.62]My shift's over.
[28:53.76]I'm ready.
[28:54.57]I got a perk.
[28:55.57]What do you mean your shift's over?
[28:56.59]I'm still working.
[28:58.25]What is that?
[29:00.11]I don't know how to work.
[29:02.10]Okay, so if it's a credit card that's on the screen, you need to type that number.
[29:06.42]Okay, everyone just chewed me out in my chat for this.
[29:10.79]You have to hit zero, then that decimal.
[29:12.93]You can't do decimal first.
[29:14.21]And apparently, I'm stupid.
[29:18.17]How do I do this?
[29:18.77]Oh, I see.
[29:19.11]I understand.
[29:19.71]Okay.
[29:20.93]That was a bad time to say that.
[29:23.06]Hold on.
[29:23.34]I need to make change.
[29:26.52]I can't see.
[29:27.12]You need to get out of the way.
[29:27.90]Why is it a comma instead of a period?
[29:29.46]That's weird.
[29:29.82]Difficulty 10.
[29:35.55]Oh.
[29:35.63]This guy bought three salts.
[29:36.81]I'm feeling pretty good right about now.
[29:38.05]I like these signs.
[29:39.89]We put up the signs.
[29:42.48]Oh, thank you.
[29:43.06]I did.
[29:43.54]Yeah.
[29:44.66]Ah!
[29:46.28]How do we get a TV?
[29:47.44]Ah!
[29:48.73]You're going to play funny YouTube videos?
[29:50.85]Sorry about that.
[29:51.55]I'm going to have... You know what?
[29:52.57]I'll give you a little bit of a discount here.
[29:55.42]Yeah, dude.
[29:56.10]I want to watch funny videos while we play.
[29:59.24]That'd be insane.
[30:01.75]The heck is this?
[30:02.71]It might be local, though.
[30:05.01]That sucks.
[30:05.41]I think I just fucked that up.
[30:09.61]Ooh.
[30:10.02]Alright.
[30:10.36]$7.19.
[30:10.72]We need to up these prices.
[30:14.60]Or any of these.
[30:15.98]Yeah.
[30:16.20]Do you want to do more salt price?
[30:18.40]I think it's 50 cents.
[30:19.34]We should be 55.
[30:21.58]What are we doing with the cereal?
[30:23.91]Not me to click that one.
[30:34.92]Fuck.
[30:35.04]Man.
[30:35.54]We're making money.
[30:36.24]Where's our money up there?
[30:37.16]Top left?
[30:39.47]Yeah, I may have spent some of it on tombstones.
[30:41.67]Like...
[30:43.10]Like graveyard tombstones?
[30:44.92]Yeah, I see that money.
[30:46.57]That bank account is draining.
[30:48.49]Hey!
[30:51.49]Wait, why did we put an advertisement in here for a thing that's not even our store?
[30:55.36]I didn't even mean to click that.
[30:56.92]DLC.
[30:57.58]It's DLC.
[30:58.36]Poke, can you go to the mouse here in the back?
[31:01.01]Wait, you can't click it?
[31:02.89]I can't, no, because it's DLC only.
[31:08.94]How do I move it?
[31:09.94]We gotta close it.
[31:10.62]It's getting overwhelming.
[31:12.13]Vinny, I'm gifting you.
[31:14.01]No, I don't want it.
[31:14.59]No, no, no.
[31:15.57]Don't give it to me.
[31:17.02]Wait, is this like a bad company?
[31:19.86]Click on the mouse cursor.
[31:20.88]Click on the mouse cursor in the bottom.
[31:22.22]It's a loss.
[31:22.56]It's a loss.
[31:22.99]It's fine.
[31:23.61]Change it to a picture of your choice.
[31:26.49]Oh.
[31:27.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:27.63]You can put Labubus on there if you want.
[31:29.32]Pretend we got Labubus.
[31:30.60]Or like Dubai, Dubai, Dubai chocolate.
[31:33.64]If it works.
[31:35.29]I got a lot.
[31:35.79]We need another checkout, man.
[31:36.77]There's a lot of customers waiting.
[31:39.36]Well, maybe you should do it faster.
[31:41.41]Why don't you do it?
[31:41.87]This is hard to do fast.
[31:47.87]Fuck.
[31:48.35]How do I delete that?
[31:49.39]Take it.
[31:49.63]It's fine.
[31:50.13]It's a... That's the only reason we have products.
[31:53.46]Oh, man.
[31:54.48]This is great.
[31:55.18]We'll have a great time.
[31:56.70]What's Vinny doing?
[31:57.98]I'm doing cash register right now.
[31:59.38]I'm helping out.
[31:59.98]What's Poke doing?
[32:01.08]Poke is trying to put a weird picture on the sign there.
[32:05.97]I'm doing logistics.
[32:07.43]Okay.
[32:09.50]Do we have an HR department?
[32:12.51]What do people not have?
[32:14.13]What are they saying they don't have?
[32:15.21]We found peppermint.
[32:16.59]Elemental cheese.
[32:18.19]This guy wants elemental cheese.
[32:20.96]I've never heard of that before in my life.
[32:22.68]Is that like some kind of free-range cheese?
[32:25.92]That's the shit that Khadgar is eating.
[32:28.37]What are you talking about?
[32:29.41]Elemental cheese.
[32:30.21]Oh, fuck.
[32:39.81]What is Valerian without the context of Game of Thrones?
[32:43.33]I was going to say Valerian Steel.
[32:45.94]Bro, what's going on?
[32:46.44]Give me your card.
[32:49.80]Give me your credit card.
[32:53.59]Hello?

[33:11.72]What, you see it?
[33:12.86]Yeah.
[33:13.66]I don't see it.
[33:14.74]I don't.
[33:16.38]Then why do I see it?
[33:18.37]Why do you see it?
[33:19.07]I don't.
[33:21.81]Wait, that was 10 cents.
[33:23.68]These are like the same guy.
[33:25.58]Ster, look at it.
[33:27.04]Oh, fuck.

[34:04.96]17?
[34:05.72]It's 17, dude.
[34:08.04]Fuck.
[34:08.82]17 is the witching hour.
[34:11.28]That's when we have our most busy moments.
[34:14.09]Can somebody else do the cashier?
[34:15.73]So I think we've lost probably $30 or $40 since I've been doing this.
[34:19.01]I need to go builder mode.

[34:49.92]You built the... You know, I'm sorry.
[34:52.92]If we didn't price stuff so stupidly, this wouldn't be a problem.
[34:57.62]Everything should be a zero or a five.
[34:59.71]Yes.
[35:00.07]Is it $5?
[35:00.47]It's $4.97.
[35:02.97]You can price things.
[35:04.33]There's like a price scanner here.
[35:06.09]Maybe that's how you do it in the employee room.
[35:09.98]It should be $10.
[35:11.28]Is it $10?
[35:11.92]No, it's $8.96.
[35:13.40]No, it's $10.
[35:15.72]No, it's $12.45.
[35:17.27]It's $10.
[35:17.97]Just give me $10.
[35:19.41]Okay, I'm offering solutions.
[35:22.22]Well, I'm working the register.
[35:23.72]You told me to stay at the register.
[35:26.68]Yo, can I spend 400 bucks?
[35:29.71]Yeah, yeah.
[35:30.99]I've been spending a lot of money.
[35:32.51]In real life.
[35:33.75]Alright, it's getting dark.
[35:34.37]It's getting dark.
[35:35.09]It's getting dark.
[35:36.45]Okay, Poke, I just saw you do a Street Fighter move.
[35:40.04]I don't know.
[35:40.52]What the hell?
[35:40.96]You just did the... You just did that.
[35:50.78]Alright, let's see if that works.
[35:54.75]I'm the manager.
[35:55.31]I don't have to work.
[35:56.61]People aren't buying salt anymore.
[35:58.07]I think we priced it too high.
[36:01.73]Oh no.
[36:02.95]This has to be... Come on inside.
[36:07.26]I don't see anything, Poke.
[36:08.70]What are you trying to change?

[47:11.90]Okay.

[49:14.86]Thank you for... I did it.
[49:17.05]Guys, can we not sell items in odd numbers?
[49:19.02]Because it's like 27.
[49:20.38]You know what I mean?
[49:21.26]It should just be like 0 or 5.
[49:23.26]Go away!
[49:26.25]No.
[49:26.85]What are you doing?
[49:28.73]Who uses cash anymore?
[49:31.11]What did you ask, folks?
[49:32.47]Trust me on this one.
[49:33.88]I'm sorry.
[49:34.92]I was being mean to start.
[49:37.60]What is it?
[49:38.10]I was panicking and thinking that I have a limited supply of ones.
[49:44.13]And I was like, I can't just use all of my ones.
[49:47.09]It was too real for a moment.
[49:48.59]Oh, that brought you back flashbacks, huh?
[49:50.64]I remember those days too.
[49:52.10]I can just fucking spam whatever I want.
[49:55.00]Yeah, you can.
[49:56.02]Yeah, but you will give them that money.
[49:57.55]If you give them too much money, it doesn't go, sorry, that's incorrect.
[50:00.53]You actually will lose money.
[50:04.66]We are now stocking mental cheese.
[50:07.52]And then you get put on suspension.
[50:09.38]Let me make that a clean $2 play, by the way.
[50:15.67]I hate working here.
[50:21.37]Olive oil is selling well.
[50:22.49]Yeah, are we not, like, so when it says market price, how much more do we have to go than that?
[50:30.14]I'm making everything clean.
[50:31.54]I'm making $2.50 for the mints.
[50:35.29]We gotta up these prices.
[50:36.57]Market price is $1.45.
[50:37.69]That means we don't make any money.
[50:39.47]Right, right.
[50:40.63]I'm going $1.50 on some of these items.
[50:42.20]We're going $2.
[50:42.70]Someone bought salt.
[50:43.60]Someone bought salt.
[50:44.88]Manager.
[50:45.16]That's the first person.
[50:45.96]Excuse me, manager.
[50:46.98]Yes?
[50:47.88]Boss, can you make everything not 99?
[50:50.70]Can you make it like zeros, odd numbers?
[50:54.35]Absolutely.
[50:54.93]I can't think.
[50:55.79]Absolutely.
[50:56.19]What about taxes?
[50:57.51]I'm making everything even.
[50:58.83]Yeah, why is this $1.99?
[51:01.99]Who made this $3.49?
[51:03.30]No, make this $4.00.
[51:10.72]Manager, make it as difficult as possible.
[51:14.49]And then we can determine who the employee of the month is.
[51:18.97]Much better.
[51:19.61]Imagine somebody walks over and just makes it more expensive in front of you when you pick it up.
[51:28.00]Guys, are you seeing this ladder?
[51:30.67]Yeah, is it... Does it need to move, or is it... Is it, like, glitched on your screen, too, or no?
[51:36.79]It's kind of messed up.
[51:38.37]okay oh god vid are you trying to get to the roof yeah I'll be right back guys I'm gonna guys why are we poor I because I bought a refrigerator for the cheese for the mental cheese and that cheese has got to be more expensive they're not giving me enough time to conversate with these people that cheese is going up to 250. yeah but that's you you're not really supposed to there's too much yeah like I'm trying to make small talk so that they come back to our store
[52:07.83]did you talk to people in real life no how okay here's a good question for all four of you myself included I guess how when you're out when you're out do you strike up conversations with people like chit chat with with like random people that like you know like a diner or something or you're online how how yeah are you guys oh yeah
[52:34.66]I once my stream is off I turn into deaf mode death and mute I can't hear what anyone says and I can't talk like it's over okay gotcha so you need that that introvert time maybe I like a food place if I see another guy there I'm like is it good oh you you you do the uh oh that looks good how's that
[53:01.14]Yeah, maybe that sometimes.
[53:03.22]My talking to people has escalated.
[53:04.88]Oh, I should have got that.
[53:12.35]There, you know what the worst part about that poke is?
[53:14.71]If you're on the receiving end of that and it sucks, that's not fun because it's like, oh man, look at that.
[53:22.40]How does that one taste?
[53:23.20]That one looks good.
[53:23.96]Oh, I should have ordered that.
[53:24.90]And you can't, it's hard to be like, actually you ordered correct because this is awful.
[53:32.27]I was at a restaurant bar, and I had myself a margarita and some empanadas, as you do.
[53:40.08]And the guy was talking to everyone.
[53:42.76]There's a guy next to me, like, just talking to everyone.
[53:46.59]And it was like, the staff was getting to the point where they were just finding things to do to not be near him.
[53:53.52]And then he started talking to me, and I just kept nodding.
[53:56.82]Like, I was eating, so I couldn't talk to him.
[53:58.54]So I was just nodding.
[54:00.07]I was like you just gotta go I'm good oh sorry what do you think like actually like like overwhelm him with conversation um were you were you talking about prices in the game no no I mean like yeah with him you need to like meet him on his level you said match the vibes match the vibes I know there was some days where I was like uh bored enough to do like a voice to people
[54:26.15]like pretend to be british when when I was checking out groceries because they don't know pretend to be british yeah that's all strategy oh alright people want milk brick apple juice we got to get this cleaned up we got to have different sections right now the salt is next to the cheese is next to the olive oil is next to the salt is next to the bread pricing everything at exact even values I feel like there's a lot of uh
[54:52.80]We're leaving a lot of money on the table.
[54:55.26]It's easy.
[54:56.53]When I stepped in and became manager this day, we're now in the green because I'm actually making these.
[55:02.82]Guys, half the stuff was being sold.
[55:06.96]Somebody walked around and made things one cent more than the market price.
[55:12.55]It's crazy how full our shelves still are of salt.
[55:17.28]See, this market price is $1.99.
[55:19.00]It's listed for $2.00.
[55:21.47]We're making one cent profit on this.
[55:26.20]That's not gonna buy us any fucking liquid plasma screen TVs.
[55:29.32]Okay, well, you're the manager.
[55:30.56]You need to sort it.
[55:31.32]Okay, also, I have to say, I'm having no issues with the amount of customers that are showing up.
[55:36.77]Because now everything's more expensive.
[55:38.11]We have less customers.
[55:38.94]Well, everything's priced in even.
[55:40.88]You want to know what it is?
[55:42.20]I was stocking the shelves, and most of the shelves are empty now, and it's just salt again.
[55:46.31]Someone's looking for rice.
[55:47.33]Someone's looking for apple juice.
[55:48.87]I got it.
[55:49.21]I'm on it.
[55:49.61]I'm on it.
[55:49.89]I'm on it.
[55:51.73]I unlocked soda, and soon we can hire an employee.
[55:54.43]Where do we... Soda!
[55:56.19]Where do we soda?
[55:56.93]Where do we buy soda?
[55:58.25]We should invite a viewer that just does all the work.
[56:00.58]Well, why would we even be streaming this?
[56:07.41]We would just be sitting there doing nothing.
[56:12.03]I mean, I'm kind of doing nothing.
[56:13.87]No one's buying anything.
[56:15.57]Stop!
[56:19.59]Where do we buy stuff to stock?
[56:21.73]We have soda now.
[56:23.05]I want to sell soda.
[56:23.65]Go up front.
[56:24.01]Go up front.
[56:24.45]I bought a bunch of shit.
[56:25.55]There's boxes to stock.
[56:28.26]Oh.
[56:29.18]Wouldn't that be a good idea, though?
[56:30.14]Just make the viewers work and you're just the manager?
[56:33.02]Yeah.
[56:34.06]One day someone will make that game.
[56:35.28]Get out of the way.
[56:35.79]I need to make this fucking money.
[56:44.77]Alright.
[56:45.24]Load it up.
[56:45.98]Is this a month cook?
[56:49.20]The water says Montcuc on it.
[56:50.83]I don't know what that means, guys.
[56:52.89]We can hire employees.
[56:55.29]We... How?
[56:57.81]There's a... On the blackboard.
[57:00.39]I don't think we should.
[57:01.50]I feel like, yeah.

[57:14.69]Um...
[57:21.97]Okay.
[57:23.08]Well, what else do we need?

[57:30.95]We got soda, cola, sugar-free, and premium soda.
[57:34.19]All coming in right now.
[57:38.08]How do you even order that stuff?
[57:39.24]Where'd you get it from?
[57:40.26]In the room with all the skill tree, the manager blackboard.
[57:44.61]And you go to product order.
[57:48.21]How do we multiply our money?
[57:51.25]we need we got to expand we get a higher premium products and we have to price them accordingly we have to yeah we have to um mark up our prices times two easily yeah don't go over times two though because people won't pay for it okay oh we get an anti-theft door
[58:19.86]Has anybody stolen?
[58:20.70]No, I don't think we've had that.
[58:23.56]Day one, we're still noobs.
[58:26.12]It's me.
[58:28.05]Do you guys ever steal from work?
[58:35.29]Not answering that.
[58:37.56]How do you think I had my first cigarette?
[58:40.04]I stole... I went to the freezer at a grocery store.
[58:44.63]When I was working there, I stole a Lunchable pizza one.
[58:49.44]Oh, shit.
[58:50.16]I was thinking how do you how are you talking about?
[58:54.80]Twitch?
[58:56.35]Oh, yeah, I go live.
[58:57.67]You guys have I get one sent off every viewer that I'm not supposed to have.

[59:12.14]I'm on it.
[59:12.80]Okay.
[59:15.79]I was working night shift.
[59:16.57]I was hungry.
[59:18.40]I was saying that before the stream started.
[59:20.72]If you were stocking shelves and you were stocking the ice cream aisle, wouldn't you just pull out an ice cream, dig into it with your spoon claws, fingernails.
[59:29.14]Spoon claws?
[59:30.78]Always.
[59:31.95]What are you talking about?
[59:33.39]Spoon?
[59:34.01]You put your fingers all together and then your nails are long enough that it's like a spoon.
[59:40.25]You're talking about just digging in to ice cream and then smearing it into your mouth?
[59:49.10]Yeah, with your spoon claw.
[59:51.20]I like that.
[59:52.14]We have the ninja ice cream maker.
[59:55.17]We don't have time for that.
[59:56.49]You don't even have to go anywhere.
[60:01.66]I think I'm going pro in this.
[60:06.08]She bought three fucking salts.
[60:08.55]I still have not made ice cream.
[60:10.64]What?
[60:10.98]You haven't made any ice cream?
[60:11.70]I've still not made anything.
[60:12.48]No, I've been so lazy.
[60:13.64]I just put old ice cream in there.
[60:16.45]Wait a second.
[60:17.51]You have not made anything in the Creamy Swirl?
[60:20.59]You haven't made anything?
[60:21.61]No, not yet.
[60:23.05]Weren't we talking about how great it was?
[60:24.72]You were saying it was like, oh, there's so many recipes, so many great things to do.
[60:27.42]Yeah, I mean, the recipes are cool, yeah, but remaking ice cream, like just putting old ice cream in there.
[60:34.74]The texture difference.
[60:35.80]You're putting old ice cream in it?
[60:37.00]Okay, not old ice cream.
[60:38.22]Just freezer ice cream, you know?
[60:40.52]Haagen-Dazs!
[60:41.89]You put some Haagen-Dazs in it.
[60:44.73]I see.
[60:44.97]So you're turning the door-bought ice cream into soft serve.
[60:50.00]Oh, yeah.
[60:50.46]Yeah, okay.
[60:51.14]I feel you.
[60:51.64]I get you.
[60:54.24]Dude, you got to make some of the recipes.
[60:56.06]You got to do the Dole Whip knockoff.
[60:58.89]It's awesome.
[61:00.81]Tell me how to do it.
[61:01.39]I'll do it.
[61:03.14]Um, I think we both have the same book that it came with.
[61:07.26]Is the book easy?
[61:08.07]Like, is it actually that easy?
[61:08.93]Just put frozen or... You got it?
[61:13.35]Oh, fuck.
[61:13.91]Hold on.
[61:15.30]What do we need?
[61:15.96]What are people asking for?
[61:19.82]Green tea infusions.
[61:21.29]Um, yep.
[61:23.47]Lemon tea.
[61:28.10]Uh... Milk brick coming in.
[61:31.24]Yogurt coming in.
[61:36.38]I'm going pro.
[61:37.80]Why is there 100 tombstones?
[61:39.65]There's just a section for tombstones.
[61:42.45]I don't know.
[61:43.23]And Halloween items.
[61:44.91]What?
[61:45.27]Where?
[61:45.47]It's crazy.
[61:47.01]It's right before staff room.
[61:49.58]There's just tombstones.
[61:52.72]After lights, Halloween, and then staff room.
[61:55.78]Yep.
[61:56.73]So press tab and then press X, Jerma, and you'll see a spooky ghost and it's just like tombstone A through F.
[62:04.60]The weirdest placement for it.
[62:07.08]That is weird.
[62:08.74]Yeah.
[62:12.15]Should we have a pumpkin here?
[62:13.31]We have to festivize this a little.
[62:24.40]Oh my god, that's $100.
[62:27.24]Oops.
[62:28.19]I have an idea.
[62:29.07]Can I pick up and rotate things?
[62:32.71]Yeah.
[62:33.31]How do you move an object?
[62:35.31]tab and then you go to placement mode at the top alright we're gonna put this at 20 off but I'm gonna make it four dollars the retail that's a lot of product that's just sitting out here uh we need more freezers if we're gonna sell this stuff
[63:01.67]Use the blue bin across the street.
[63:03.19]It will give you money for empty boxes.
[63:05.35]Oh.
[63:13.24]These things, we could sell these for such a premium.
[63:15.72]Where did you move the checkout?
[63:18.65]Sorry.
[63:19.17]I'm fucking working.
[63:20.71]You're not funny, dude.
[63:22.09]You're not funny.
[63:23.33]How do I make this go?
[63:27.83]How do I increase the increments?
[63:28.96]I'm doubling up.
[63:29.80]I got both.
[63:31.66]Wait, is it angled?
[63:32.70]I'm going psycho mode.
[63:34.76]Really?
[63:35.10]Yeah.
[63:36.70]I believe in you.
[63:37.42]Tomorrow, I'm going to the Nationals.
[63:42.81]Why is there like a pumpkin trapping this door?
[63:46.73]Yeah, we're going to put the- Put all these pumpkin stuff outside.
[63:48.96]I moved them because they were in the way of the registers.
[63:52.42]You can put them wherever you want now.
[63:54.34]Yeah, move mode, right?
[63:56.38]I want to pick something up.
[63:59.49]How do you go to- How do you pick something up?
[64:00.99]Okay.

[64:39.01]I bought milk brick.
[64:41.19]Yeah, look, it's all out on the shelves now.
[64:43.16]Guys, we didn't make any money.
[64:44.36]Wait, do we have $7 again?
[64:46.64]Yeah, it was all pumpkin related.
[64:47.94]It was pumpkins.
[64:50.02]You gotta spend money to make money, you know?
[64:54.97]People spend more money when they see pumpkins.
[64:57.27]It's true.
[64:57.75]It's psychologically real.
[65:01.66]Why do you have the cola above the Sprite?
[65:07.37]Sprite should be on top.
[65:08.57]Don't you know anything about color theory?
[65:10.72]No.
[65:13.36]Oh, we had ketchup in the back.
[65:24.10]Just wait until we put out.
[65:28.23]What even goes in this?
[65:29.35]Because we can't seem to put anything in here.
[65:33.19]What goes in where?
[65:34.98]Come on here.

[68:36.05]Even when I didn't have the DLC, you know what I mean?
[68:39.10]I couldn't even see the picture.

[75:16.57]You understand how long it took him to curate that?
[75:18.94]There's D-list desserts.
[75:21.46]I like it.
[75:23.45]Does that mean it's like discounted?
[75:24.89]No.
[75:27.19]Is it too expensive?
[75:28.37]What the hell do y'all need?
[75:29.42]Oil?
[75:30.96]Soda pack.
[75:33.06]Don't we have that?
[75:34.62]Yeah, we got plenty of soda.
[75:36.17]They're complaining about nonsense.
[75:41.14]Oh.
[75:42.07]I thought did you just sneeze yeah how did you do a sneeze in that voice that was insanely impressive what the hell was that yeah it's it's a thing I do I it's I started I don't like like burping or on stream so like when I sneeze I'm like that's not good so I gotta turn it into a bit on stream
[76:06.36]No, he actually did.
[76:07.22]He did.
[76:07.50]He shit his pants on stream before.
[76:09.38]That's not a joke.
[76:10.83]That's cool.
[76:11.29]Really?
[76:11.55]I was there for it.
[76:15.66]Sir, you won't eat.
[76:16.68]You won't eat on stream, but you'll shit your pants.
[76:19.05]Yeah.
[76:19.67]Who has time?
[76:21.55]You're shitting yourself, sir.
[76:23.26]Go to the bathroom now!
[76:26.62]We were playing a game of Overwatch.
[76:28.24]We were in an Overwatch game, and it was getting really intense.
[76:31.97]By the way, this was an unranked game.
[76:33.73]It was meaningless.
[76:35.74]And he shit his pants, and he stayed in it until the game was over.
[76:39.48]And that is literally watchable.
[76:40.90]It is watchable right now.
[76:42.33]You could watch the whole thing.
[76:43.45]I think it's on the Archive channel.
[76:45.87]I cannot believe that for a moment.
[76:47.39]I can't believe it.
[76:48.23]Sir shit.
[76:49.86]Sir shit.
[76:51.80]It was worth it because we've been talking about it for a long time.
[76:54.54]Yeah, it's been a great callback.
[76:57.19]Honestly, I would do it again.
[77:00.91]Jerma talks about Sir shitting his pants on stream two years ago.
[77:06.12]Wait, it's not even us talking about it?

[78:05.43]I don't know.
[78:07.07]Alright.
[78:08.94]Jerma, my corner is just ketchup and pasta.
[78:13.56]All I have.
[78:15.40]It's like the American section at the European grocery stores.
[78:19.01]It's like, oh, look, a taste of America.
[78:20.87]And it's like ketchup, Lay's potato chips, and like Twinkies.
[78:26.08]Joel sent me like American sauce from Sweden.
[78:30.40]And it was just this weirdo fucking freak ketchup or something.
[78:33.51]It was so weird.

[78:41.98]Like, that was his thing.
[78:42.94]He had to try White Castle.
[78:44.93]I love that place.
[78:46.61]If you want to see me shit myself, that's a start.
[78:50.87]Only heard about people shitting themselves with White Castle.

[93:47.14]He just wakes up, he looks like a demon.
[93:49.24]The guy just looks like a fucking demon.
[93:50.78]I think I actually am locked.
[93:57.39]It's just full of mustard.

[94:20.58]Oh, I've been talking about them a little bit.
[94:24.43]That guy should run a place called Fuck Faces.
[94:31.47]I think he runs a good place.
[94:32.38]I think he's just a crazy boss.
[94:36.51]Yeah, take social media away from him and maybe you'll be better off.
[94:39.90]I mean, the game is pretty good.
[94:41.64]Thank you again, Poke, by the way, for that key.

[98:12.59]My favorite cereal is Lucky Charms without the marshmallows.
[98:17.32]Are you insane?
[98:22.25]Oh, that was a sarcastic.
[98:23.97]Lucky Charms without the cereal.
[98:26.27]Without the marshmallows.
[98:27.32]I just want the milk.
[98:28.06]Yeah, Lucky Charms without the cereal.
[98:30.10]It's just milk.
[98:32.91]I think after this stream, I'm going to go to the grocery store.
[98:38.44]Oh, this got you inspired to grocery shop?
[98:41.37]What are you going to get?
[98:42.29]He's going to work.
[98:44.16]Yeah.
[98:44.84]I'm taking over a register.
[98:47.60]I'm just going to stand behind one and see if people come to my aisle.
[98:51.31]Genuinely, real question.
[98:53.07]What other jobs have you guys had?
[98:57.55]uh shit my pants that's not a job just just the grocery store alright I worked at a booth at a mall approaching people to sign up what was the product what was the sign up to be background actors did movies was there a casting couch no this is a huge scam
[99:18.90]Pretty sure.
[99:21.24]It's good you added the pretty short of that.
[99:25.39]When I was a child, and I could be exploited for my labor, I worked for D2Legit.com to rush Diablo II characters to endgame and level them, and they sold them.
[99:37.54]That's crazy.
[99:39.64]They literally paid me in items.
[99:42.23]Did you guys ever get a job from Craigslist?
[99:44.25]That is such a Ster job.
[99:47.29]But how do you...
[99:49.37]use the items do you sell the items then or you just keep them yeah I kept them yeah it was terrifying oh my God it said uh marketing twice marketing specialist or some I went there it was some weird place
[100:11.19]and they hired me to go door to door in a van with these people and it's a sketchy building and just try to get people to donate I quit the first day oh my god yeah I wouldn't want that I wouldn't want that at all and it was a craigslist job I've done substitute teaching that was fun oh yeah I know that yeah I knew that info about you you liked it?
[100:37.84]why did you do that?
[100:39.63]Because it was cool.
[100:40.27]I don't know.
[100:40.57]It was an interesting thing.
[100:41.39]I enjoyed it.
[100:43.34]We did what?
[100:44.44]Substitute teaching.
[100:46.30]What?
[100:46.62]Really?
[100:46.91]Yeah.
[100:48.55]I sure must get that energy.
[100:50.65]You think there's any kid that's like, wait a second.
[100:52.20]I know that guy.
[100:53.06]Let me see the pictures.
[100:54.64]What movie did you put on?
[100:57.65]I will say, I've told this before, but when kids would come up and they would have a question about a worksheet they were doing and I didn't know the answer, and I'm supposed to know the answer, so like a seventh grade math, it would be like, oh, can you teach me how to do this?
[101:17.28]I don't understand this question.
[101:18.56]And I'd be like, oh, fuck, I don't know either.
[101:22.02]And I would have to roundabout try to tell them.
[101:25.82]Like, that, well, you see, when your teacher's here, you'll get a lot more of that information.
[101:31.39]But let me take a quick look at it.
[101:32.49]I'd like hold it up close to my face, pull it away.
[101:34.39]Let me take a quick look at that.
[101:36.30]What I think you should, and I'm just like panicking, waiting for like the lunch bell to ring.
[101:42.16]Yeah, well, you know what?
[101:43.13]You were on the right track here.
[101:44.29]You were on the right track here.
[101:45.21]Why don't you try it again?
[101:46.15]Three or four more times.
[101:48.19]For 40 minutes, you did that.
[101:50.47]buy time I do feel like I my teachers same kid 90 of my teachers in school would would not admit they didn't know something you did a filibuster sit there and use filler words to the same kid for like 40 minutes I mean I would get fired but like was there like a reason you couldn't just say I am unaware of this information thank you for asking
[102:15.90]I mean, I did get there.
[102:18.18]I did get there at some point and be like, you know what?
[102:20.35]I'm not, like, familiar with the lesson plan.
[102:22.83]I tried to, you know, use the bullshit words.
[102:25.21]I'm like, you know, I'm not familiar with the lesson plan.
[102:27.32]There are all kinds of lesson plans that could be.
[102:30.86]I don't want to, like, step on the toes of your teacher.
[102:34.31]I don't know.
[102:34.65]Does she usually give you the answer?
[102:36.11]Are you cheating right now?
[102:37.39]Does she usually just fucking give it to you?
[102:42.44]I'm not vibing with this lesson plan, yeah.
[102:45.55]I thought you were supposed to work for it.
[102:46.61]It doesn't resonate with joy.
[102:53.54]What do you want, 750?
[103:03.02]No, I never really played any videos.
[103:04.60]I don't think that was... I didn't wheel in the TV like I was so used to when I was younger.
[103:10.32]Bill Nye.
[103:12.06]Oh yeah, they wheeled in the TVs for me.
[103:13.89]I remember that.
[103:14.83]We watched, I went to Catholic school, which is a problem, but it was rough.
[103:22.10]It was like 16 years of Catholic school.
[103:25.60]It didn't stick, I'm sorry to say, but Davey and Goliath, Davey and Goliath, they would wheel in the TV and show us that.
[103:33.81]You had to pray?
[103:34.61]Did you pray every morning?
[103:35.88]Oh yeah, we had to pray.
[103:38.19]I still remember some of those prayers.
[103:43.58]Our Father is a slingshot.
[103:48.09]Goddamn.
[103:48.59]That ring a bell?
[103:49.31]Yeah, it didn't work because it was like so much that it had the opposite effect on me.
[103:54.55]And it was like every year a different teacher would have a different theory on what was like, you know, the kids were kids.
[104:01.72]So it'd be like, is the Bible real?
[104:03.12]Did this happen?
[104:03.78]Did a guy live inside of a whale?
[104:05.73]And one year a teacher was like, yes, that actually happened.
[104:09.17]The Bible is real.
[104:10.17]It all happened.
[104:11.31]And then the next year, the next teacher would be like, no, that didn't happen.
[104:15.16]so it was like really early that a lot of us myself included were like no I don't I don't know about that so they didn't do a really good job at getting us in there you you graduated first year catholic catholicism and then next year the new teacher updated your world view
[104:34.33]Yeah.
[104:35.33]Yeah, that was the goal.
[104:36.23]And then I had a... Were you a black belt?
[104:38.81]How far did you get?
[104:41.32]Yeah, I was a master of karate.
[104:47.01]I knew how to say the prayers very quickly.
[104:49.33]I swear, this one teacher I had was having a divorce or some shit.
[104:55.02]Because looking back, she was like... She was telling us about the...
[105:00.38]What's that thing in the sky that will run out and we all die?
[105:02.26]The sun?
[105:03.19]Oh, the rapture?
[105:04.35]No, the... The sun.
[105:06.21]The ozone.
[105:07.21]The ozone layer.
[105:07.89]She was like, yeah, just to let you guys all know, the ozone is going to last a few more years and we're all dead.
[105:13.90]What?
[105:15.02]That's what she told us in class.
[105:16.21]That's so scary.
[105:17.77]Oh, my God.
[105:18.05]Yeah, she's saying, yeah, well, the government's not telling me the ozone's going to run out and we're all dead and shit.
[105:22.28]She said this word for word.
[105:27.21]So when it didn't, was she just like, well, you know, give or take?
[105:34.16]She just disappeared.
[105:36.26]She's probably getting fired.
[105:37.48]Yeah, she got ozoned.
[105:39.36]She didn't have enough.
[105:40.14]What are you going to do?
[105:49.31]Am I giving the right change?
[105:50.58]Yeah, yeah.
[105:51.42]How are we only 300 bucks?
[105:52.82]What's happening?
[105:54.18]I'm spending it all on new products.
[105:57.33]Should I just chill?
[105:58.17]You guys ever, like, get in a weird, like, in an airplane, um... Yeah, I'm gonna chill.
[106:03.94]Someone's, like, taking your armrest?
[106:07.59]Ever happen to you guys?
[106:09.03]No, I've never been mogged by the other passenger.
[106:12.19]Really?
[106:12.49]Yeah, I fucking help with that shit.
[106:14.15]This guy kept trying to Mohg me and take it, and I told him I had autism.
[106:16.84]What the fuck?
[106:18.30]What?
[106:18.70]Poe, can you repeat that?
[106:19.66]What do you mean?
[106:20.38]How do you... What?
[106:21.50]What are you talking about?
[106:23.35]The whole flight was so awkward.
[106:26.80]I think I saw you tell this story on the stream why was that your first like response though like why did you think I don't know I don't know it was so awkward uh we just kept fighting for the spot and he kept putting his arm in my spot and I told him I'm autistic I can't handle this
[106:43.55]What did he do?
[106:44.88]He looked at me and said, what?
[106:48.16]He had the same reaction that we just did.
[106:51.45]No, I mean, no, we just split it, I guess.
[106:54.21]What?
[106:54.83]You split it?
[106:55.75]Did your skin touch his skin?
[106:57.16]Yeah, it just fixed, I guess.
[107:00.10]I just couldn't handle his arm touching my arm.
[107:02.30]He had no shirt on.
[107:04.48]Yes sitting next to me just just sweating just sweating I was like actually the whole flight I was like this has to work That's a crazy reaction and what did you say he knew like he knew I was bullshitting I
[107:27.97]that's insane poke you could have just said that you had like a strep throat and that probably would have been helpful be like I got strep throat that's probably better no I don't know maybe I don't know I just seen that interaction play out just like it would be like oh my goodness what is going on in seat fucking tube 3b what is going on over there
[107:52.59]I was quiet.
[107:53.51]No one heard it.
[107:54.99]It was, I don't know.
[107:56.76]Except him.
[108:00.78]It was a hell of awkward though.
[108:02.87]Yeah.
[108:03.35]Sounds it.
[108:04.43]Well that, okay.
[108:05.33]Here's the thing.
[108:07.07]You can't escape that.
[108:09.54]So that's why you have to be really careful of what, how neighborly you are to the person sitting next to you on a plane.
[108:14.92]Cause that it's not like, oh, well I'm fucking done with this conversation and this person, I'm just going to leave.
[108:20.65]No, no, no.
[108:21.11]You are literally next to them, sitting inches from them for hours at a time.
[108:26.42]It's like, excuse me, I was fucking kind of weird and awkward.
[108:29.16]Can I, like, move?
[108:30.69]It's like, no.
[108:32.11]There's been plenty of situations where I've not been, like, necessarily awkward, but I usually try to keep completely to myself.
[108:37.93]Somebody wants to talk about the weather, you got it.
[108:40.46]That's it.
[108:40.96]Like, oh, sunny out.
[108:41.78]Sunny out there.
[108:42.70]Done.
[108:45.28]Yeah.
[108:46.45]I mean this goes back to the conversation we were having earlier too about like how personable you are and like as a New Yorker I'm not supposed to be personable like people get suspicious in New York if you're too friendly because that usually means a scam so we're just like programmed to avoid talking to people weirdly yeah but you know I'll talk to someone if I'm on like public transport it's just um you know there's also times where I want to be alone with my thoughts
[109:14.91]and if if someone is like now invading my mind space that's weird so yeah if okay here's I I completely agree with you like I like having my own mind space but like I will I can handle you know when it's like like like an old lady wait wait I've never seen you wear a foil hat
[109:35.90]uh but if like an old lady sometimes will just be sitting on the plane be and they'll just kind of be talking out loud waiting for like a response potentially do you know what I mean oh wow these headphones these headphones are sure are they're heavy these headphones are heavy I've never seen headphones this heavy before uh the food I heard the food is very good I heard the food's delicious I don't know I wonder if the soda is a little too sparkly and you'll be like oh actually yeah this it is pretty sparkly it is isn't it and then they kind of talk to you for like 10 minutes that's fine I'm cool with that
[110:05.78]I am recalling that I think I was being hit on by like an 80 year old woman when I went to go buy a stapler
[110:14.64]that's pretty cool man she came into the office supplies segment and was like oh office supplies it was just like I oh you told me a whole story about how she used to like uh work at her father's uh supply store too and she kept calling herself like sorry for being like interrupted by like a weird old office lady she was really into it get that g kill did you get the number great sorry
[110:42.18]I'm autistic.
[110:46.79]What?
[110:49.68]Prove it.
[110:52.10]Imagine he said that.
[110:55.45]Like, Hal, what do you want me to do?
[110:58.51]Tell me about... I don't know, what is your interest right now?
[111:03.50]Fuck.
[111:04.90]We only have $560.
[111:07.30]I have no idea what the fuck to do with this.
[111:09.52]Why are we making no money?
[111:11.35]We keep restocking the shelves for more people to buy things.
[111:14.87]We need to make it more expensive.
[111:16.13]But when you're restocking, are you selling it for more?
[111:18.45]Are you putting it up and putting the gun out there?
[111:20.66]It presets it for the price that it was last time when you put it new on the shelf.
[111:24.54]Okay.
[111:25.98]Maybe we should oversell like crazy.
[111:28.76]gotta be careful not to go too far then I'm still just restocking you know what I mean like we need to just not stock first we're so cheaper than market price here how do we catch up what I'm I don't know how are we feeling fellas I don't know you wanted to play this game no it's it's fine it's fine now do we want to continue playing the game is the question or do we want to fix some holes
[111:56.11]Is the digging game better?
[111:57.88]I don't know.
[111:58.64]That's a good question.
[112:04.33]I am good either way.
[112:05.65]I feel like we're just kind of vibing and talking.
[112:08.13]I'm cool.
[112:08.96]I feel like I'm working.
[112:13.78]It's great.
[112:18.75]Let me take the...
[112:20.63]Let me take a look at the reviews of the digging game.
[112:23.42]Are we still open?
[112:24.42]Oh my god!
[112:25.06]Oh my god, you scared the fuck out of me, man.
[112:26.64]I scared you?
[112:27.74]Yes.
[112:28.00]It's very positive.
[112:30.69]It's a very positive game.
[112:32.61]What happened?
[112:32.91]The digging one?
[112:34.03]Yeah, it looks good.
[112:34.93]I'm just like walking around.
[112:35.73]I'm really trying to get this to happen without saying it happened.
[112:38.82]Alright, are we moving on to the digging game?
[112:40.72]Yeah, quick game.
[112:41.76]I just quit.
[112:42.38]Vinny just said, he said, fuck this.
[112:44.74]Wait, we're positive 400.
[112:46.99]Wait, why is it red?
[112:49.81]we did it we made a profit finally that just I've stun locked me because it's red but it's positive I went into the digging game oh okay well I guess the connection lost
[113:01.54]For the record, I have no problem just saying like, guys, let's play a digging game.
[113:07.17]But when I throw a proposal out there, it's also like I want to take like a vibe check.
[113:10.79]You know what I mean?
[113:11.31]See how we're all feeling.
[113:12.28]I'm matching the vibe.
[113:14.18]You're matching my vibe?
[113:15.00]We could also play Ninja Turtles arcade game with four players.
[113:22.67]I'm down for whatever you want.
[113:23.85]Do we need to switch to that?
[113:25.28]You do not.
[113:26.14]It's on Steam.
[113:27.00]Although the connection was kind of rough.
[113:29.05]I played something with Squeaks with it before.
[113:30.67]It's a little crusty, but it did work.
[113:34.39]Oh, so we're like the B crew.
[113:36.46]Shredder's Revenge, you mean?
[113:38.08]No, I mean the Cowabunga Collection and it is the actual arcade game.
[113:42.48]It's the emulated arcade game.
[113:44.31]I think that we're yapping and we're in a dig a hole mood and we should just dig the hole and the next time we can play a real video game.
[113:49.25]We all have hole digging game?
[113:52.44]It is Keep Digging is the name of the game.
[113:55.49]Okay.
