[00:43.45]Hey.
[00:43.63]Hi, everybody.
[00:49.91]Yeah, sometimes we're late, sometimes we're early.
[00:51.87]That's the way it works.
[00:53.89]I'm never live at 7 o'clock.
[00:56.08]Just know that.
[00:58.20]You're gonna get... Every stream is gonna be between like 6.40 and like 7.45.
[01:03.58]I will never start the stream at like 7 o'clock.
[01:07.55]It's just... It's like a soft 7.
[01:09.29]That's what I've said a million times.
[01:12.48]We just, we go and we're ready to go on the days that we're going.
[01:17.84]Anyways, hi.
[01:18.44]Good, uh... Good evening.
[01:24.59]Uh, I had the pleasure... Pleasure of purchasing a SEGA CD.
[01:33.21]Let's just wait till people get in here, you know?
[01:36.99]Just turned on the stream, let's get in here.
[01:44.39]And make sure that tweet goes through.
[01:51.76]So it took a while to hook up.
[01:54.76]It took like...
[01:57.16]I had to get like an HD adapter, so this thing could actually be captured by a capture device.
[02:03.66]So it's going, I got SEGA CD going into this capture device, going from their HDMI into my capture device, being captured into my computer onto OBS.
[02:18.19]I tested it a lot, it's gonna work.
[02:21.92]It should work pretty flawlessly.
[02:25.47]Although I've said that before and who knows how real that actually is going to be.
[02:33.01]But the things that we do to see things, right?
[02:39.23]This is a very old game.
[02:40.33]This game came out in 1993.
[02:41.07]It's funny because this game's actually getting like an HD remaster.
[02:46.72]It's coming out on PS4 in like two and a half weeks or like three weeks or something.
[02:51.76]But you know what?
[02:52.44]Fuck that.
[02:52.86]We're going to play the shitty original one.
[02:57.15]When are we going to start watching movies on stream?
[02:58.77]Like, right now.
[03:00.41]Like, legit tonight.
[03:02.89]Is when it's going to happen.
[03:13.14]Very old streamer stream.
[03:14.36]Very old game.
[03:15.28]1993.
[03:16.40]Alright.
[03:16.88]So, let's go ahead and switch this over.
[03:27.37]No rumble?
[03:27.85]The rumble was not going to be tonight.
[03:32.39]I was originally going to have it be potentially for tomorrow.
[03:35.29]But I want the whole weekend to dedicate making characters.
[03:39.51]I don't want to give you guys like a half-assed wrestling card.
[03:42.87]I want to like make a shitload of new characters.
[03:45.17]I don't want to have it be rushed.
[03:51.25]So, uh, let's turn this thing on.
[03:55.43]And, like, pray that it fucking works.
[03:59.21]So here we go.
[04:00.95]Strap yourself in.
[04:03.80]Is this gonna fucking work?
[04:05.84]Here we go.
[04:08.16]Ding.
[04:08.52]Hey, look at that SEGA CD.
[04:13.93]Checking the disk to make sure it's not all scratched the fuck up.
[04:22.02]This is an original SEGA CD, by the way.
[04:24.40]This is a SEGA CD.
[04:27.14]Wait, what's going on?
[04:29.22]First try.
[04:32.55]This is a real pain in the ass to get to work.
[04:35.83]We already got some, like, artifact in it.
[04:37.25]It's alright.
[04:42.05]I might have to, like, reset the device.
[04:47.34]That's a first.
[04:47.78]That is a first.
[04:52.99]Alright, you got like the sneaky James Bond character, sneaking by.
[04:56.39]Remember, this shit is original Night Trap.
[05:04.66]Alright, I think I might have to like move this.
[05:06.44]Wait a minute, let me hold on.
[05:10.94]What if I do like, do this.
[05:17.49]Written by Terry McDonald.
[05:20.11]Written by fucking Ronald McDonald.
[05:25.22]Clear.
[05:25.48]There you go.
[05:27.76]Oh, God, this looks like shit.
[05:30.30]I'm Commander Sims of the SEGA Control Attack Team.
[05:34.58]SCAT Mission 230.
[05:35.22]Oh, my God, this looks great.
[05:36.94]Five teenage girls have disappeared after spending the night at the old Lakeshore Winery house of Mr. and Mrs. Victor Martin and their children, Jeff and Sarah.
[05:48.64]Oh, God, no, forget about Jeff and Sarah.
[05:52.05]Right now, another five girls are headed towards the Martins to spend the night.
[05:56.86]Your mission, protect those girls from whatever happened to the last ones.
[06:01.24]Now listen up.
[06:02.86]Last night, one of our agents got into the house and found some kind of weird security system.
[06:06.58]Hidden cameras in almost every room and a series of traps.
[06:09.60]Our agent spliced an override into the security system, allowing you to have control of the cameras and the traps with this remote unit.
[06:19.71]Use the traps to capture anyone or anything that endangers the lives of those girls.
[06:25.83]But make sure you don't trap someone you should be protecting.
[06:30.59]One slight problem.
[06:32.21]The traps are protected with an access code.
[06:35.09]They won't work unless you enter the right code.
[06:37.80]Right now, the code is set up to blue, and you have control of the traps.
[06:42.40]But anyone inside the house can change that code at any time.
[06:46.00]So pay close attention to what they're saying.
[06:49.48]Man, make sure to take this egg out.
[06:50.78]Our override cable is here in hallway one.
[06:53.32]Holy shit, I can't even see that.
[06:55.64]This thing might be a little funky.
[06:58.44]This is my attack squad.
[07:01.56]This looks way worse.
[07:02.84]One of my best undercover agents.
[07:04.90]She'll be arriving with the rest of the girls.
[07:08.20]I'm putting her life and the lives of those other girls in your hands.
[07:11.44]So don't even think messing up.
[07:15.28]If you don't have the brains or the guts for this assignment, give the controls to someone who does.
[07:20.48]Pass the controller to your older brother.
[07:22.20]The girl should be pulling into the driveway.
[07:25.17]Hold on a second.
[07:25.55]You're wasting time.
[07:26.71]Let's see what happens if I do this.
[07:27.83]Get over there now.
[07:29.57]Wait, wait, wait.
[07:30.81]Looks like you're not up to this mission.
[07:32.95]Breaking contact.
[07:33.79]Alright, so let's go.
[07:40.33]So he broke contact and now we make our way over to the house.
[07:48.17]What?
[07:48.35]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[07:51.32]Did I have to, like, press a button to, like, accept the fucking mission?
[07:56.08]Hold on, he just disconnected the SEGA Genesis controller.
[07:59.32]All of a sudden, I, like, can't play the game?
[08:01.41]Wait.
[08:05.43]Oh, Jesus.
[08:11.67]Shit, hold on.
[08:12.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:14.06]I'm gonna get it to work.
[08:14.82]Everyone just hold on.
[08:24.72]Okay, I accepted the mission.
[08:29.63]Alright, so I gotta like walk around the house, right?
[08:33.73]It's currently on blue.
[08:37.29]This is like the bathroom.
[08:40.95]Oh, people!
[08:42.41]These are bad guys, right?
[08:50.01]What just fucking happened?
[08:54.11]I apparently had dropped the guy through like a trapdoor Where are the girls?
[09:07.74]Where are the people?
[09:08.70]What the fuck happened?
[09:15.50]Oh, look, there's another guy.
[09:17.12]He just went out the window.
[09:17.90]Hold on a minute.
[09:18.30]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[09:18.84]Okay, we got an entryway, we got a kitchen, we got a hall.
[09:21.92]Did I, like, what happened?
[09:22.62]Did I skip everything?
[09:26.25]I'm really confused right now.
[09:30.97]Is there anybody here?
[09:31.61]Oh, wait, wait, oh, alright.
[09:36.65]We got more, like, foot soldiers.
[09:37.85]We got more, like, putties from fucking Super Mario Brothers.
[09:40.95]I mean, Power Rangers.
[09:46.62]This is like these weird, like... Here we go.
[09:50.24]I got him.
[09:50.56]Alright, I think I may have missed, like, what the fuck.
[09:57.78]Who's this?
[09:58.18]Who's this?
[09:59.34]What the fuck does that mean?
[10:16.97]So, what's happening tonight, Dad?
[10:19.87]Well, we have to bottle the two downstairs.
[10:21.73]Drop them?
[10:22.81]And Sarah's coming in with six more tonight.
[10:24.53]I don't think I can drop them.
[10:26.19]Yep.
[10:27.15]The problem is Sheila and I might have to make a delivery.
[10:30.05]That's no problem.
[10:30.69]Tony and I can handle it.
[10:31.71]Yeah, Tony and I can do it.
[10:33.03]I'm not so sure.
[10:34.17]These have to go, too.
[10:35.95]So nobody has arrived yet.
[10:36.97]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[10:37.61]What's this?
[10:38.13]This is a special vintage.
[10:39.35]Oh, Jeffrey, don't be so selfish.
[10:41.39]Fuck the story.
[10:41.93]We got, like, we got, like, boogeymen to capture, right?
[10:44.96]Nope, wait, nope.
[10:49.75]Here comes like the sleepover party.
[10:51.15]All my friends are coming over.
[10:53.21]We're gonna go on the Nickelodeon snick couch.
[10:57.85]Should we go outside?
[10:58.97]This is outside.
[10:59.91]They all should be here, right?
[11:01.03]Did this fucking lady come in a hover boat?
[11:18.35]Somebody came in like a jet ski.
[11:19.88]Hi, Megan.
[11:21.76]What?
[11:21.94]Oh, come on, everyone.
[11:22.94]I want you to meet my parents.

[11:57.87]I don't fucking understand this.
[12:00.47]Why is this house booby-trapped with a bunch of, like, fucking gas?
[12:03.35]That doesn't make any sense.
[12:04.29]Oh, there's another one.
[12:06.81]I hope there's no trap doors in here.
[12:08.40]Who will be sneaking this one?
[12:10.06]Oh, no, I'm gonna go through here.
[12:12.28]I'm gonna be in the hallway now.

[12:20.68]That's Weird Eddie.
[12:21.86]He's just one of the neighbors.
[12:22.80]He's really good at that.
[12:23.96]No, that's just Weird Eddie.

[17:16.18]I have the wrong code.
[17:18.88]What code is it?
[17:19.78]How do I know what code it is?
[17:21.10]Should I have listened to these fucking people talk?
[17:25.29]Oh god dammit, Nickelodeon schnick.
[17:34.10]I don't know what the fucking code is.
[17:39.66]That girl just took her clothes off in the background, for no reason.
[17:42.28]Why are they getting naked?
[17:43.82]Oh god.
[17:44.34]Oh shit, here we go.

[17:56.73]Come on, everyone.
[17:57.53]I'll show you to your rooms.
[17:58.41]Okay.
[17:59.07]Somebody got a hold of the system.
[18:00.75]Okay, what color is it?
[18:04.71]What's that?
[18:06.43]Look, it was your job to protect Kelly and the rest of those girls.
[18:10.59]From what I've just seen, the place is being overrun.
[18:13.32]You've missed way too many of those suckers.
[18:15.90]Until you figure out how to do your job, you're dismissed.
[18:18.88]What?
[18:19.26]Breaking contact.
[18:20.48]No, that's not how it works.
[18:21.60]You don't just unplug the player from the fucking console.
[18:25.46]You're in a state-of-the-art facility.
[18:26.76]You don't just unplug the USB and the whole system goes down.
[18:29.49]Okay.
[18:31.99]Too many suckers.
[18:35.19]Okay, that was great.
[18:38.65]No, fuck that.
[18:39.23]I'm doing it again.
[18:39.83]Dude, I'm doing it again.
[18:44.56]We need to get there.
[18:46.94]You had 7 out of 40 possible criminals.
[18:49.26]Well, what the fuck?
[18:49.94]How am I supposed to keep trying?
[18:53.02]I can't even skip this.
[18:59.08]breaking contact.
[19:00.50]Yeah, I just unplugged your webcam.
[19:05.66]No, we're doing this again.
[19:11.02]I'll just fucking hard reset the goddamn console to get us back to where we were.
[19:15.89]Watch this shit.
[19:18.31]Easy.
[19:20.79]Bingo.
[19:29.76]Alright, let's do it.
[19:30.34]Am I going to play the other SEGA?
[19:33.56]I have a box behind me that is full of SEGA CD games.
[19:41.98]Full of them.
[19:42.92]Alright, let's go.
[19:44.36]Fucking skip it.
[19:44.94]We know what to do.
[19:45.96]I need to get the right access code.
[19:47.58]I need to capture more criminals.
[19:50.56]So, we're just going to skip the fucking round until we can find them.
[19:53.32]Here we go.
[19:53.90]Skip.
[19:54.26]Here we go.
[19:54.54]Let's go.
[19:55.19]Catch them all.
[19:56.55]Gotta get them all.

[20:15.95]More guys?
[20:16.75]No.
[20:17.67]Yep, yep.
[20:18.11]Sneaking in the fucking window.
[20:20.95]Two guys.
[20:25.33]No, no, no, no.
[20:27.79]No.
[20:28.29]Ha-
[20:29.32]No!
[20:30.96]Okay, I got at least one.
[20:34.91]Somebody got the bathroom.
[20:36.77]No, where's the bathroom?
[20:42.23]Living room, bathroom.
[20:44.26]No, bathroom.
[20:51.14]What?
[20:51.88]What's going on?
[20:52.30]Did I get him?
[20:53.16]Alright, dropped him.

[22:44.42]Dude, you can't even, like, watch the cutscene.
[22:46.67]That's what I imagined, though.
[22:53.44]Oh, come on.
[22:53.96]What is with this, like, Five Nights at Freddy's bullshit?
[22:57.72]Now I know where they got the idea.

[24:02.46]Come on!
[24:03.98]Oh my fucking god.
[24:05.32]He's gonna get away.

[25:47.19]I will not get this guy.
[25:48.17]Yeah, I will.
[25:52.13]Fuck you, buddy.
[25:56.23]Is it enough, though?
[25:57.23]Is it enough for me to not get yelled at by my superior?
[26:02.91]They changed the code, too.
[26:04.60]I need to know what the fucking code is.
[26:12.40]Everybody outside.
[26:13.06]Everybody in the fuckin' Nickelodeon.
[26:15.14]Yep.

[26:26.93]Come on.
[26:29.05]No, this is a stupid rock and roll music.
[26:39.30]I need to know what the fucking access code changes to.
[26:46.20]No, he just told him to go fuck off, okay?
[26:48.36]He said, go die, Eddie.
[26:50.08]Hey, Spencer, what's going on?
[26:56.69]Dude, this is... What the fuck?
[26:58.27]Where are these people even coming from?

[27:07.45]Good hunting.
[27:08.67]Okay, I think he just said green, didn't he?
[27:11.83]Okay, they just said they would change... I swear to God, we just caught them saying they changed the code to green.

[27:53.92]And then two more guys got in.
[28:04.00]Like, now it's green.
[28:08.42]Nobody's going to be in the living room while they're dancing around.

[35:52.67]What happened to all the other girls?
[36:02.48]So that girl just jumped out the window.
[36:03.80]Fuck.
[36:08.91]Come on, we gotta get out of here.
[36:09.95]They're after us.
[36:11.29]Yeah, nice try, kid.
[36:12.99]I'm serious.
[36:13.67]Come on, I'll show you.
[36:14.69]Wait a minute, Danny.
[36:15.39]Just calm down and tell us exactly what you saw.
[36:18.03]I went down in the basement and I saw these control rooms with monitors and buttons for traps.
[36:24.41]Oh, shit.
[36:25.42]We just heard the same audio clip twice.
[36:28.22]What?
[36:29.08]You're missing the point here.
[36:30.90]You've got to be trapping one of those leeches.
[36:33.64]This just won't cut it.
[36:35.28]You put those girls in danger, that means you're out of here.
[36:38.41]Oh, my God.
[36:39.01]Breaking contact.
[36:39.71]Don't do it.
[36:40.23]Don't do it.
[36:41.61]Oh.
[36:46.93]They got her.
[36:48.59]Apparently, they got her.
[36:55.35]Well, okay.
[37:00.63]Well, there's the original Night Trap for you.
[37:05.39]We could try one more time.
[37:07.25]I'm willing to give it one more attempt.
[37:18.84]Why am I so bad at fucking Night Trap for SEGA CD?
[37:26.20]You can't be bad at Night Trap.
[37:28.26]The game is just fucking stupid.
[37:30.86]It's a stupid game.
[37:32.22]I'm the associate producer.
[37:52.44]This game is unbelievably hard.
[37:55.14]From my understanding, this game is, like, fucking impossible.
[38:07.71]Alright, for the sake of, like... I have a lot of shit in this box.
[38:13.16]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[38:16.18]Well... That might not be the end of Night Trap.
[38:21.73]Play the 32X version.
[38:23.09]I don't have a 32X.
[38:26.47]Let's just swap in Wirehead.
[38:29.50]This one could be fucking outrageous.
[38:31.10]Let's do Wirehead.
[38:37.34]Let's give it a try.
[38:42.56]I bought this one.
[38:43.98]There's so much random shit in here, dude.
[38:46.46]I have so many SEGA CD games.
[38:48.24]We'll never do them all.
[38:50.51]We're never going to complete all these.
[38:55.17]Shit, where is it?
[38:57.55]Actually, no, fuck that, we're gonna put this one in.
[39:04.20]So many.
[39:05.72]Alright, let's do... Let's do this one.
[39:11.19]Alright, this one's called Double Switch.
[39:19.70]Don't ask me how any of this is going to work.
[39:25.31]Here we go.
[39:27.83]We're currently putting in Double Switch.
[39:31.99]That's the name of this game.
[39:33.21]Double Switch.
[39:35.33]We should probably change that.
[39:36.92]I don't even know if this game's on.
[39:41.74]How's it going to work?
[39:42.44]No fucking clue.
[39:45.06]No, we're not playing the Switch.
[39:46.70]I'm putting on Double Switch.
[39:51.34]Here we go.
[39:57.76]Checking disk.
[39:59.96]Here we go.
[40:03.24]Double Dragon?
[40:03.83]No, not Double Dragon.
[40:04.59]Oh, by the way, while I have a second.

[40:32.79]Yeah, you have to trap them when the bar turns red, but who knows.
[40:38.00]Thank you to Spektag.
[40:39.08]This looks awful, I love it.
[40:40.44]Buddy stream, other people.

[41:02.47]It is very, very fun.
[41:04.09]Let me solve that.
[41:10.45]This looks like somebody, like... It sounds like somebody pitch-shifted, like a Tim Burton song did not get copyright claimed on YouTube.

[42:13.67]Hey.
[42:16.48]Hi.
[42:18.12]My name is Eddie.
[42:19.56]I need your help.
[42:20.34]Another creepy Eddie.
[42:21.18]This is my building.
[42:22.58]And since the neighborhood really sucks, I've built all these traps and security systems to protect the people who live here.
[42:28.68]The problem is some bonehead locked me in the basement and cut off my controls.
[42:32.41]So they forgot about the phone lines, which is how I got you in.
[42:36.35]Now you can protect the tenants and get me out of here.
[42:41.47]You and me are friends, right?
[42:42.69]You gotta help me.
[42:46.65]I love how they just throw you in here.
[42:47.73]It's the same game.
[42:51.56]Now this is the lobby.
[42:53.88]That's Elizabeth.
[42:54.80]She's the manager.
[42:56.02]There's a problem.
[42:56.98]Don't expect her to deal with it, okay?
[42:59.12]Okay.
[42:59.50]You can see the traps and triggers for each room by pressing the start button.
[43:03.49]Oh, yeah.
[43:04.43]To get me out of here, you gotta get the number from each of these power boxes.
[43:08.31]Now, they flash on when anybody opens them, so you keep your eyes peeled, okay?
[43:12.52]This is Brutus.
[43:13.64]He just got out of prison.
[43:14.92]This guy's using a fucking metal detector inside of a house?
[43:17.36]But I don't like anybody snooping around my place, okay?
[43:21.18]This is Alex's room.
[43:22.28]This guy's looking for fucking old coins?
[43:24.04]New-grown talent.
[43:24.95]Says she's a journalist.
[43:27.53]I think she likes me.
[43:31.29]Alright, let's see what's going on.
[43:32.67]So I, this is like, this is central, right?
[43:55.65]He was about to yell at me.
[43:56.51]Alright, so what's a phone box?
[44:00.42]Power punch.
[44:04.60]Am I... What am I supposed to do with this guy?
[44:10.00]Alex cam.
[44:13.12]Hey, now you're making me look bad.
[44:23.65]Screw up again and you're gone.
[44:28.50]Wait, what?
[44:29.36]I don't understand.
[44:31.04]Fireplace, window.
[44:34.20]Oh fire, okay, I see, I see.
[44:38.70]Window.
[44:40.50]Fireplace.
[44:46.04]Wait, I don't think I understand what's going on here.
[44:53.12]Lobby cam.
[44:54.96]Fan and column.
[45:00.20]Power overloaded.
[45:05.75]Does that mean it's, like, armed?
[45:09.01]Does anybody have any fucking idea?
[45:12.57]What the fuck?
[45:19.57]There was no rhyme or reason to any of that.
[45:25.36]We have to figure this out, though.
[45:26.66]This is important.
[45:31.48]So, hold on.
[45:31.96]Let's go to the options.
[45:34.80]House traps... Between house and traps is C, okay?
[45:38.88]Change room is A. Arm trap is A. And disarm trap is B. Okay.
[45:52.99]We have to figure this out.
[45:55.31]So, I can skip this, right?
[45:57.55]You again?
[45:59.19]Come on, get with it.
[46:00.21]Get me out of here.
[46:02.22]So you change rooms.
[46:03.58]So here we go.
[46:03.94]We gotta go in here.
[46:04.42]We gotta go up here right now.
[46:06.76]Alex can... Okay.
[46:15.84]So let me... Here are the traps, right?
[46:17.32]So arm trap is window.
[46:18.87]Arm it.
[46:20.37]That's arm.
[46:23.43]Fireplace is now arm.
[46:24.47]What did he just do?
[46:26.23]He just stepped on something.
[46:29.37]I don't understand.
[46:35.53]Don't I have these things armed?
[46:37.63]Hey, now you're making me look bad.
[46:41.17]Screw up again.
[46:41.89]He stepped on the thing and she just screams.
[46:45.75]Okay.
[46:49.98]These are both armed.
[46:51.58]Fireplace and window are armed.
[46:53.24]He's touching them right now.
[46:54.64]They're armed.
[46:55.90]These are both armed.
[46:59.38]Shouldn't that have activated and fucking killed him?
[47:05.47]Don't ask me.
[47:07.05]I have no idea.
[47:07.65]Now we're on the band camp.
[47:11.49]Let's turn on the mummy.
[47:12.83]This is on.
[47:13.83]The mummy is on.
[47:14.51]How do I actually use it?
[47:15.79]It doesn't make any sense.
[47:18.03]Do you have to trigger them?
[47:19.93]I don't think so.
[47:21.05]You should just arm them.
[47:37.70]There's so many ways people could stupidly die in this game.
[47:40.80]I need to figure out what's going on.
[47:44.02]Let's try it again.
[47:47.72]Come on, yell at me again.
[47:51.27]Maybe I have to go past green.
[47:52.77]That's what I'm doing.
[47:56.49]Alright, let's go.
[48:06.98]Yeah, I know.
[48:07.76]Cover me.
[48:08.48]I'm in trouble.
[48:09.00]Okay, so let's go with, like, window.
[48:14.29]So this is armed now.
[48:15.43]Maybe I have to press it one more time?
[48:20.63]Maybe he has to be standing on it.
[48:24.37]Like when it beeps.
[48:27.22]Got it, right?
[48:27.92]No?
[48:38.76]Uh, so if I... Hey, you're making me look bad.
[48:45.18]Okay.
[48:47.00]Screw up again, and you're gone.
[48:49.19]That's the window?
[48:49.93]Oh, yeah, but, like, I mean... So, if I... Let's go over here.
[48:55.35]Grads cam.
[48:56.29]Okay, there's... Coffin.
[48:59.61]And... What the hell?
[49:00.43]Whatever the hell that is.
[49:02.28]There's nobody here.
[49:05.96]What about, like, over here?
[49:08.35]In the lobby.
[49:08.71]Seems like your kind of thing, Phoebe.
[49:10.57]Thank you, Mrs. Edward.
[49:12.35]Fan column.
[49:13.41]Elizabeth, girls.
[49:14.61]Somebody, like, is up here.
[49:15.47]This is, like, the box, right?
[49:19.41]We're, like, up here.
[49:22.27]Brutus cam punch.
[49:31.24]Power box.
[49:34.56]Okay, he turned off the power.
[49:35.46]You let those suckers get to the power box.
[49:38.65]And now we're all cut off.
[49:40.49]It has to be primed when he steps on it, but yeah, but it... I did that already.
[49:44.87]This could be so funny, too, if the game actually, like, physically functioned.
[49:55.60]We're gonna try Fireplace first, and then I'm literally turning the console off and putting another game in.
[50:04.36]This doesn't seem to be very much rhyme or reason to any of it.
[50:08.51]I'm gonna prime the fireplace.
[50:14.21]Okay, fireplace.
[50:21.40]Prime.
[50:23.52]With the fireplaces ready.
[50:26.32]Okay, here he comes.
[50:29.95]Fireplace.
[50:34.57]That didn't do anything.
[50:42.60]Get the fuck out of here.
[50:47.16]Let's put in another one.
[50:51.54]Give me a fucking break.
[50:58.83]Give me this one.
[50:59.45]This one's called Surgical Strike.
[51:07.12]Surgical strike.
[51:11.22]Continues.
[51:15.86]And here we go.
[51:20.65]Press it when he's on the trap.
[51:22.79]I did that like three different times.
[51:27.98]Let's just play surgical strike.
[51:29.48]We can always go back to that.
[51:36.12]This is why they call me the surgeon.
[51:40.68]Uh, thank you Glazed Donut for the bits.
[51:42.91]Also, bleh, let me just burp.
[51:45.93]Uh, thank you Zach for the bits.
[51:47.99]This game gave me a migraine.
[51:50.79]That's what I was doing, folks.
[51:52.71]I did that like three fucking times.
[51:57.87]Not how you do it.
[51:59.12]I can guarantee it.
[52:05.18]It's happened.
[52:07.57]A renegade terrorist has begun launching missiles on innocent civilian populations.
[52:13.29]Somebody just turned up the volume way too loud on this one.
[52:15.87]...a path of destruction across the Middle East.
[52:17.75]I am invincible.
[52:20.57]What the f... Executive River, Chris Beckman.
[52:32.16]Alright, let me like...
[52:34.34]UN Secretary General has called for a surgical strike.
[52:40.63]Good.
[52:40.99]Offer a surgical strike.
[52:43.37]Oh, this is... Did you see that guy flying?
[52:48.41]This is too much red.
[52:49.57]All I can see is red explosions.
[52:51.42]Is that Martin Sheen talking, by the way?
[52:53.34]Okay.
[52:53.60]Surgical strike, 1985 SEGA CD.
[53:04.37]Please format the built-in memory.
[53:08.11]Why do they always say that shit?
[53:09.67]Intro.
[53:11.80]Let's see what's going on.
[53:17.34]Touch TV movie.
[53:20.68]Wait, did we already see this?
[53:23.02]It's happening.
[53:27.92]I already watched the intro.
[53:32.85]Okay, options.
[53:34.61]keys a is bullet b is rocket c is turn level normal credits scores again it's just abc let's give it a try
[53:49.03]It's the latest in stealth technology.
[53:52.15]One quarter ton of the most sophisticated navigation, intelligence, and firepower that money can buy.
[53:58.66]On the ground, nothing can touch it.
[54:02.28]The Stinger Gatling gun fires 20 millimeter explosive bullets.
[54:06.32]Doubles as a shitty fair bumper cart.
[54:09.16]Depleted uranium heads cut through tanks like butter.
[54:13.19]OK, soldier.
[54:14.49]Cabool knows you're here.
[54:15.39]You're going to have to find your own way in.
[54:18.34]JJ and I'll give the look down from here.
[54:21.24]He's got a fucking terrifying stare.
[54:23.30]Alright.
[54:25.58]Where does it want me to go?
[54:30.16]What?
[54:33.41]Take out the missiles before they get off the ground.
[54:35.77]Shoot for the boosters.
[54:36.75]Shoot for the boosters.
[54:40.05]Oh my fucking god.
[54:45.87]Wait, this is still going?
[54:48.48]What is happening?
[54:49.20]Why did I just explode?
[54:50.22]Did I explode a tank?
[54:52.94]Which way do I go?
[54:55.54]Turn!
[54:56.46]Turn?
[54:57.60]Dude, everything is melding together.
[55:08.41]It's not even possible to see who's who.
[55:10.41]I guess I'll turn right.
[55:12.77]Shoot that thing with a missile!
[55:14.63]Got it.
[55:19.89]I thought he was- Turn!
[55:22.29]Turn left!
[55:27.49]What is he- I'm hit!
[55:34.25]I'm hit!
[55:34.85]I gotta get outta here!
[55:39.93]I don't even fu- What is fucking happening?
[55:44.89]I can't even like fucking tell you guys what I'm doing!
[55:49.27]It's just the camera's moving left and right really fast.
[55:52.88]And then things are exploding on the screen.
[55:55.42]What the fuck?
[56:01.57]Who's this guy?
[56:27.56]My fucking head is killing me right now.
[56:33.65]I don't know.
[56:35.83]There's no rhyme or reason to any of this shit.
[56:37.77]This is the fucking best game I've ever played.
[56:51.39]Am I dead?
[56:52.73]I think that was my car that exploded.
[56:56.86]Oh.
[56:57.94]You don't look.
[56:59.70]You don't listen.
[57:01.28]And you don't think.
[57:03.32]You have elevated being deaf, dumb, and blind to a damn art form.
[57:08.74]When you're on the ground, you can't think too much.
[57:11.50]Who is this guy?
[57:12.46]You gotta feel it.
[57:14.26]You hesitate, boy.
[57:15.68]You're dead.
[57:16.81]You're telling me I hesitated?
[57:19.13]I blew up like fucking 35 buildings, man.
[57:22.81]And we're still okay, apparently.
[57:24.57]Apparently I can go down here.
[57:30.90]Got it.
[57:31.86]Turn.
[57:34.20]Got to aim it up and shoot.
[57:36.95]Missile.
[57:38.79]Got him.
[57:39.17]I'm going to take a left turn up here.
[57:42.59]Shoot that.
[57:44.37]Got him.
[57:47.42]Right here.
[57:48.00]Shoot it.
[57:48.44]Got it.
[57:52.34]Turn.
[57:53.58]No, not yet.
[57:55.24]Machine gun.
[57:56.76]Got him.
[57:57.50]Machine gun.
[57:57.96]Okay, let's go.
[57:59.02]Up here.
[58:05.39]You know, you don't think, soldier.
[58:07.81]It's kind of ridiculous.
[58:08.91]You don't think ever.
[58:12.56]I mean, you're supposed to be tactically shooting these things.
[58:16.05]It's not like there's no rhyme or reason to any of this entire fucking video game.
[58:19.49]Guy just ran by in a 3D suit and shot you like four times.
[58:23.37]Get this guy up there.
[58:23.99]Fuck!
[58:24.19]I didn't get him.
[58:28.17]I ran out of gas.
[58:31.72]Is he talking about me?
[58:44.27]They don't even give me an opportunity to do anything.
[58:46.05]Like, seriously.
[58:51.44]What was that?
[58:52.08]I just blew up the whole street.
[59:00.53]Am I supposed to be turning?
[59:01.53]I am the damage.
[59:02.63]I am the problem.
[59:12.92]I'm just turning the car.
[59:13.78]Just turn it.
[59:16.70]My brain hurts.
[59:17.34]We're going to have to turn this one off real soon.
[59:21.04]Who are these people?
[59:29.31]We got snipers all up the roof there.
[59:32.35]This is the surgical strike.
[59:34.39]More like drop bombs in every single way.
[59:39.05]Everywhere.
[59:39.47]Look at how hard this is.
[59:40.47]I gotta hit this guy right now coming across the fucking screen.
[59:42.51]Right now.
[59:43.19]Watch this.
[59:43.45]Ready?
[59:43.89]Got him.
[59:44.75]Didn't get him.
[59:45.65]I lose.
[59:45.85]I think I'm dead.
[59:58.12]Soldier!
[59:59.13]If your brains were made of dynamite, you wouldn't have enough to blow your nose.
[60:03.98]Hey, don't lose it now.
[60:06.28]We're all in this together.
[60:10.54]Alright, let's do another one.
[60:11.60]Alright, that one was fucking great.
[60:16.62]That one was, that one, I actually liked that one.
[60:18.99]We're gonna put this one in the good pile.
[60:21.19]That's in the pile, that's in the fucking good pile.
[60:23.43]Alright, what about this one?
[60:31.28]Oh, you guys are going to like this one.
[60:34.14]You guys are going to fucking like this one.
[60:36.14]I can guarantee it.
[60:38.01]Okay, if this unanimously is not the best one in the entire evening, I don't know what to say at that point.
[60:49.45]Like, I honestly don't know what to say if you don't think this is the best one.
[60:52.99]It just is going to be the best one.
[60:55.51]Here we go.
[61:00.47]I have lots of confidence.
[61:02.69]You better believe.
[61:03.37]Here we go.
[61:08.03]We're talking about, of course, how could you forget?
[61:12.54]How could you ever forget?
[61:14.94]The greatest television show of all time in the fucking 90s into the 2000s.
[61:20.32]Of course, I'm talking about... The backup RAM is not formatted.
[61:24.55]Our game... Shut up.
[61:28.45]I'm, of course, talking about...
[61:30.39]Power Rangers!
[61:31.89]After 10,000 years, I'm free!
[61:34.43]It's time to conquer Earth!
[61:36.59]Get your electric guitars ready!
[61:38.41]Recruit a team of teenagers with attitudes!
[61:41.28]Recruit those teenagers!
[61:42.18]And you know Simon Cowell, like, made this song?
[61:49.72]Turn it up!
[61:51.62]Here's Tommy!
[61:52.24]And here's Jessica!
[61:58.26]You can forget this ranger, Anthony!
[62:03.30]And Kimberly!
[62:05.91]And the Blue Ranger, William!
[62:12.51]Your special guest, Tommy!
[62:26.28]We're done blasting it now.
[62:28.16]Let's play Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.
[62:29.54]Beginner start and a beginner.
[62:30.93]Let's be fucking honest with ourselves.
[62:35.99]Ready.
[62:42.70]Welcome, humans.
[62:46.75]So who are you?
[62:47.49]Like, what are you?
[62:49.77]I am Zordon, an interdimensional being caught in a time warp.
[62:53.47]And my name is Alpha-5.
[62:55.36]This planet is under attack, and I have brought you here to save it.
[62:58.82]Look behind you at the viewing globe.
[63:00.76]Your doubts will be answered in the images you see.
[63:05.17]This is like somebody compressed a YouTube video in 1990.
[63:07.47]This is Rita Repulsa, an intergalactic sorceress who has bent on controlling the universe.
[63:13.05]With her henchmen and putty patrollers, she plans to conquer... You know the putties?
[63:16.01]See, this is Night Trap.
[63:16.77]This is just Night Trap again.
[63:18.07]The putties are in this game too.
[63:19.77]Each of you will be given access to extraordinary powers drawn from the ancient creatures you call dinosaurs.
[63:25.90]He's all the same game.
[63:27.10]Whoa.
[63:28.04]What are these?
[63:28.84]Those are your power morphins.
[63:30.79]When in danger, raise them to the sky, calling the name of your dinosaur, and you will morph into a formidable fighting force known to one and all as the Power Rangers.
[63:40.64]I don't get it.
[63:41.48]Jason, bold and powerful, you shall command the Tyrannosaurus dinosaur.
[63:45.50]We already know who the Power Rangers are.
[63:46.74]Zachary, you are clever and brave.
[63:48.60]You shall command the Mastodon dinosaur.
[63:50.64]We already know what they do.
[63:52.09]Kimberly, graceful and smart, the Pterodactyl dinosaur shall be yours.
[63:57.33]Yeah, listen to this audio quality, too.
[63:59.91]Oh, by the way, I'm... Zordon the All-Powerful is in a shower.
[64:02.57]I'm just a fucking guy in a shower.
[64:05.47]It's nice and steamy in here.
[64:25.58]That's it.
[64:27.22]And that's it.
[64:29.30]There's the game.
[64:30.62]I have a sniper rifle.
[64:32.06]Wait, do I have to kill the Power Rangers?
[64:36.32]What's going on?
[64:51.42]To shoot the Power Rangers with a sniper rifle?
[64:54.22]Oh, here we go.
[64:54.94]Here are the putties.
[64:55.48]I don't know how to play the game.
[64:57.50]Do I have to hit, like, punches and kicks and stuff?
[65:01.44]Okay, here it is.
[65:04.50]Punch.
[65:07.88]What?
[65:11.70]I... I'm not... Okay, I'm doing these on the screen, but I don't think it actually matters.
[65:22.36]Oh, I gotta hit down, right.
[65:24.90]Kick.
[65:26.34]Kick.
[65:30.60]Kick.
[65:30.88]The good belly buddy bump.
[65:33.38]Nice choreography.
[65:38.25]This is just, this is just a movie.
[65:40.89]That's all we're watching right now.
[65:43.25]Take all this shit off the screen and they could have just uploaded it to YouTube and it would have been fine.
[65:49.53]Actually, I might be failing every single one of these.
[65:54.30]I think I lost.
[65:54.92]This day is too weird.
[65:59.78]What do we do now?
[66:00.71]Just wait till it's red and trap him.
[66:02.45]Give us power.
[66:03.63]Let's do it.
[66:06.97]Mastodon!
[66:07.69]Pterodactyl!
[66:09.31]Triceratops!
[66:10.26]Saboteur Tiger!
[66:11.04]Tyrannosaurus!
[66:15.67]I don't think I can feel it.
[66:17.73]Yeah, we're just watching an episode of Power Rangers.
[66:27.96]So, um... I want to get to the end of this because I feel like this is the whole game.
[66:33.92]It's like nine minutes long.
[66:35.70]Let's see.
[66:37.66]Oh, that was wrong.
[66:39.40]If you mess up, by the way, it just shakes the screen for a half second.
[66:47.37]I can't see how there's any other missions in the game.
[66:52.63]This game was probably 180 bucks.
[67:01.01]It's all happening too fast!
[67:03.37]You know, they had like 45 megabytes of data, so they had to rush the fuck out of this whole thing.
[67:11.18]We're gonna get the credits after this, guaranteed.
[67:21.87]Here it comes.
[67:27.56]Fire.
[67:29.40]Fire again.
[67:32.54]Got him.
[67:33.08]Nice job.
[67:33.84]Up.
[67:35.64]And then lean.
[67:38.19]Launch rockets.
[67:44.37]I swear to god, man.
[67:50.50]All it took was just to play Power Rangers.
[67:54.56]Oh, we blocked it.
[67:56.91]Blocked it again.
[67:59.65]Shit, I fucked it up.
[68:00.45]No, I didn't.
[68:05.49]Well, am I going to be the only person to ever stream beat this game?
[68:09.70]I'm okay with that.
[68:12.82]Oh, there actually is a lightning bolt.
[68:15.08]Wait, what do I have to do?
[68:18.44]I press every button.
[68:22.98]We're gonna do it again?
[68:25.16]Watch out for that fucking rubber sword.
[68:26.95]He needs business.
[68:27.91]This is almost over.
[68:37.29]We're almost done.
[68:39.09]Alright.
[68:44.14]We win.
[68:48.00]What is possibly... What else is possibly... Are we just gonna like have a snack and the game's over?
[68:53.35]Now that you have become Power Rangers, you must follow three basic rules or lose the protection of the power.
[68:59.93]First, never use your power for personal gain.
[69:03.29]Second, never escalate a battle unless Rita forces you.
[69:06.70]And finally, keep your identity secret.
[69:09.38]Let's do it.
[69:11.36]Okay.
[69:11.96]Power Rangers!
[69:15.00]We did it.
[69:16.68]Power Rangers, scream and congratulations.
[69:22.78]Thank you for playing Power Rangers.
[69:28.72]That's the whole game.
[69:33.29]Wait, no, no, no, hold on, hold on.
[69:34.53]No, that's episode two.
[69:36.63]It's coming up.
[69:37.19]Green with Evil Part One.
[69:39.37]It's not over.
[69:41.82]See you later.
[69:46.58]I'm gonna get, like, jumped in the street.

[70:27.56]He's being surrounded.
[70:29.40]Block that kick into the wall.
[70:31.56]Nice counter.
[70:35.32]He's going for the fucking Ninja Turtles throw.
[70:39.62]Oh, he blocked it.
[70:40.38]Good job.
[70:40.84]Good job.
[70:41.28]Watch your six.
[70:52.94]That's it.
[70:55.56]I didn't press one button.
[70:57.64]Wait, what's going on?
[70:59.33]Did Thomas just explode?
[71:00.83]What?
[71:03.37]Why are they all burning?
[71:07.77]Rita wins.
[71:11.33]That's the end of the Power Rangers.
[71:18.78]I can't believe it.
[71:20.11]It's like Rita destroyed a part of us.
[71:22.13]They were always there for us when we needed them.
[71:24.41]Now they're gone.
[71:26.05]This is what we need the most.
[71:31.52]And that's canon now.
[71:33.28]That's canon now.
[71:34.98]That's what happened.
[71:36.58]On to the next game.
[71:40.46]The next one is going to be... It's called... This way...
[71:52.51]Oh, man.
[71:53.09]I don't know about this one.
[71:54.45]Hold on.
[71:56.77]What even is this?
[72:01.63]Alright.
[72:02.67]This one could be a real crowd pleaser.
[72:06.69]I don't know what this other one is.
[72:09.93]Because I didn't buy it.
[72:12.99]I bought this particular game.
[72:14.92]And I'm going to put it in.
[72:16.00]You'll see it.
[72:17.36]And then it came with this other game that I didn't buy.
[72:19.34]Because I had to buy all these, obviously, like third party.
[72:21.92]So this is a free game, so we'll see what the free game is after.
[72:31.35]Wonderful.
[72:33.33]Oh, God.
[72:34.23]Let's go.
[72:40.27]This is going to be like an immediate next.
[72:42.97]Like, I'm going to fucking take this out immediately.
[72:50.78]Here we go.
[72:56.45]No, it is not Madden.
[73:02.82]Same company.
[73:06.60]They just shit out so many of these.
[73:09.62]Make my video.
[73:11.58]Marky Mark and Funky Mark.
[73:16.50]Marky Mark.
[73:29.06]Mark Wahlberg presents... Here comes the copyright claim on the whole screen.
[73:49.86]I would skip this, but I don't want to.
[73:54.08]Skipping this would be a bad idea.
[73:57.25]Nobody jumps into bed like that.
[73:58.43]And what's with this fucking video quality?
[73:59.84]Is it black?
[74:00.22]Is the game black and white?
[74:04.44]You have to trap Mark Wahlberg.
[74:07.24]Oh, I would laugh my ass off.
[74:09.58]If you had to, like, drop Mark Wahlberg down a fucking 1980s cartoon trapdoor.
[74:16.07]There's this guy looking around at his room, like, cleaning his room.
[74:19.13]Where's the game?
[74:19.75]This is the longest fucking shitty establishing shot I've ever seen.
[74:31.61]This is just such an excuse to put these beginning credits here.
[74:36.99]He's gonna notice the camera now, and he's gonna be like, oh, hey, whoa, what's up, dude?
[74:42.66]That's not even Mark Wahlberg.
[74:45.48]Is that Mark Wahlberg?
[74:46.34]No, he wasn't, like, fucking seven when this video was made.
[74:48.98]Okay.
[74:52.46]Alright, like...
[75:04.05]He's so cute.
[75:06.17]You're such a perv.
[75:07.35]This guy is a serious musician.
[75:09.27]This video should be tough.
[75:11.35]It's too sexy for his shirt.
[75:13.69]Oh, my God.
[75:14.23]You can live with him and shoot him.
[75:17.03]What the fuck?
[75:17.73]Make my video.
[75:18.95]Make my video.
[75:20.26]What the fuck is going on right now?
[75:26.52]This isn't going to work.
[75:29.04]Let's ask someone else what they would do.
[75:34.57]Pick this guy.
[75:35.67]He'll be great.
[75:36.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[75:37.33]Hold on a minute.
[75:37.81]Hold on a minute.
[75:41.24]I like made this too big.
[75:46.16]Okay, to jam on a video with the girls.
[75:48.94]I need money, girl.
[75:49.90]Let's see our options here.
[75:51.92]Am I in like the girl's bathroom?
[75:53.44]What the fuck is going on?
[75:54.57]Well, it's gotta be... It's gotta be I need money, right?
[75:58.41]Let's go with the first one.
[76:09.43]Why are we asking these bambozos?
[76:11.57]It's not the guy's choice.
[76:13.29]Excuse me?
[76:13.89]No, alright, let's do it.
[76:14.95]These are close, personal friends of mine.
[76:17.81]With the guys.
[76:18.25]I need money, with the guys.
[76:23.40]Guys!
[76:24.54]Guys!
[76:26.08]Guys!
[76:26.44]We need five specific images for this video.
[76:30.78]Look at this awful wallpaper, by the way.
[76:33.10]I told you they couldn't do it.
[76:34.22]Hey, wait a minute.
[76:36.67]What if we have five different shots of pretty girls?
[76:40.27]Yeah.
[76:41.67]Let's have a shot of the girl taking off the stocking.
[76:44.48]You guys are so predictable.
[76:46.98]Okay.
[76:48.60]Cancel.
[76:49.94]No stocking shot.
[76:52.12]Let's see some legs without any stockings.
[76:55.56]Hey, dude.
[76:55.90]Find these emojis.
[77:03.85]okay I picked up I picked up just okay uh I need to pick a still so it's either shitty ballerina shitty ballerina like somebody threw up on and I can't even make up one that's like my video skate well today's unemployment figures show the economy is moving I got a bill clinton bill clinton has to open a drop in unemployment one more sign that the economy is strengthening
[77:29.91]Bill Clinton, and then we're going to go back.
[77:32.55]We're going to go to the alien dancing.
[77:34.23]We're going to get back to the latest with the umbrellas.
[77:37.89]We're going to get the guy lift up.
[77:39.23]Gorilla driving the car, crashing the car.
[77:42.47]Money.
[77:44.01]This thing here.
[77:45.93]Let's freeze it.
[77:49.51]Strobe it.
[77:51.27]Slow motion that.
[77:51.91]Slow motion that guy exploding.
[77:53.45]Flip that over.
[77:55.67]Miracle.
[77:58.40]Do I just pick from like a series of images?
[78:00.48]This is fucking, this is a mess.
[78:14.85]How much is left?
[78:15.96]Do I have to do the whole song?
[78:23.54]Oh, the thing in the middle is what's going on.
[78:26.72]That is gonna make somebody throw up.
[78:32.07]This is gonna be the worst fucking video ever.
[78:36.07]Look at the picture I made.
[78:37.07]I just smeared it and put a bunch of pictures on it.
[78:39.54]I've ruined the picture.
[78:49.56]Does Jeremy know what he's doing?
[78:50.78]Absolutely not.
[78:51.52]I need money.
[78:52.96]Yo, T-Man, I got this great idea.
[78:54.98]Well, the lyrics are, like, it's a good, like, YouTuber video where, like, every single thing that's said is written on the screen.
[79:00.50]That's how you can tell it's, like, a good video.
[79:04.76]Just in case you guys didn't know what was being said, let's, like, put it on the screen for the whole video.
[79:10.62]I need cash in a hurry and it just ain't funny.
[79:15.10]Alright, that's it.
[79:16.48]Yo, T-Man, enough is funny.
[79:20.46]Is there anything else I need to do?
[79:22.97]That's just a bunch of random royalty-free stock footage.
[79:30.63]Shots fired?
[79:31.47]What?
[79:31.73]No, I'm just saying that that's like every YouTuber.
[79:35.11]You have to do that.
[79:40.23]I'm just curious to see what happens after this.
[79:42.51]Because God knows we aren't going to fucking watch the video.
[79:52.44]This song was longer than two and a half minutes?
[79:54.20]That's the end, right?
[79:57.28]There's a person just falling down the stairs.
[80:01.99]Somebody's just got a chair thrown at him over here on the left.
[80:06.67]Like, A has been the most, by far, besides Bill Clinton on B, A has had by far the best, like, stock footage.
[80:13.88]The other ones have been fucking shitty.
[80:18.51]I don't even know what happens at the end of this.
[80:26.80]Let's flip it around, slice it.
[80:28.84]Imagine having more than 10 minutes of fun with this game.
[80:37.26]I'd cry if I was a kid.
[80:38.66]I would fucking literally bawl.
[80:40.34]Crying, if this is the game that I got for Christmas.
[80:42.60]Oh, you can pause the music video.
[81:01.38]any of these for Christmas.
[81:03.70]Dude, imagine getting a fucking SEGA CD for Christmas.
[81:06.85]That would be pretty cool back in the day.
[81:10.79]I'm gonna go look up right now, just real quick, how long is I Need Money?
[81:14.47]How long is the song?
[81:22.10]Is the song, how much longer does this go on?
[81:24.20]What's the exact time on I Need Money?
[81:29.77]342?
[81:30.25]That's not correct.
[81:31.15]I get you.
[81:31.47]4... It's too long.
[81:32.27]429?
[81:32.33]Alright, 429.
[81:32.69]We just have to see what happens at the end of this.
[81:35.13]That was fucking Ronald Reagan.
[81:38.01]Alright.
[81:38.87]That's the end.
[81:59.52]We did it.
[82:01.38]Is it time for playback?
[82:03.66]No.
[82:03.90]Already?
[82:05.40]Well, okay then.
[82:07.19]Let's go to playback.
[82:12.17]Well, today's unemployment figures show the economy is moving in the right direction.
[82:17.29]The drop in unemployment is one more sign that the economy is strengthening.
[82:24.69]This is so stupid.
[82:28.47]How do I get out of this?
[82:40.34]I ain't fucking doing that again.
[82:42.98]Give me a second.
[82:44.90]Ah, shit.
[82:46.02]Oh, no.
[82:48.36]God fucking damn it, Marky Mark.
[82:50.10]You're a terrible fucking 90s video game.
[82:53.50]Now, what is this?
[82:58.26]I don't know what this is.
[83:05.07]This is called rock painting.
[83:07.49]Hold on.
[83:13.16]Is this a video game or is this an audio CD?
[83:19.48]I don't know.
[83:21.00]This is the... Okay.
[83:35.93]Is this like this guy's CD?
[83:37.43]Did this guy like pawn off a CD on me?
[83:42.39]Dude, I think this guy put this CD in the back.
[83:52.43]What else?
[83:52.79]What is this?
[83:58.66]It's just a CD.
[84:00.72]That's it.
[84:08.48]Why would you put this in here?
[84:11.83]I bought Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch Make My CD.
[84:16.51]And this guy put in like a fucking random audio CD.
[84:28.10]Okay.
[84:31.78]That turns off.
[84:34.80]Well, we've seen that.
[84:35.80]We're going on to the next one.
[84:39.81]Alright.
[84:40.65]This one has potential, by the way.
[84:42.85]This one has a lot of potential.
[84:44.21]We're going to have to stay on this one for a while, I think.
[84:48.81]So get ready for potentially the remainder of the stream to be on this.
[84:53.64]Because the back of this box is fucking outrageous.
[85:02.88]So we're going to have to take a look.
[85:11.12]This one's called Ground Zero, Texas.
[85:13.04]It's apparently about, like, an alien invasion.
[85:19.18]Anyways, whole of one zombie, thanks for the $15.
[85:20.94]This is actually for the two internet joke.
[85:23.85]The two internets joke, as I wasn't awake to watch the last few live.
[85:27.29]Oh, well, thank you.
[85:29.49]Emperor William, Jen Betters again.
[85:32.21]Morning backup RAM has not been initialized.
[85:34.39]I'm going to have to, like, turn this off and on.
[85:38.87]But thank you, Jen.
[85:39.85]The SEGA CD was a mistake.
[85:42.12]It could have been, but I love this fucking thing.
[85:46.24]SticksRenegade, thank you for the $10.
[85:49.36]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $10.
[85:50.82]And they said, thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $10.
[85:53.12]And they said, thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $10.
[85:55.45]What?
[85:57.65]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $10.
[86:00.51]EmperorWilliam, thank you for the $4.
[86:05.17]Appreciate it.
[86:09.42]In this same exact time.
[86:13.03]Still, you know, we're gonna stick with it.
[86:25.53]SEGA presented this, apparently.
[86:33.42]South Texas, on the U.S.-Mexican border.
[86:37.01]people have begun to disappear individuals families gone without a trace all humanity is in danger and this small Texas town sits at ground zero okay ground zero Texas
[87:01.81]I like this one already.
[87:03.89]This one's already touching it once.
[87:06.25]It's a potential pull.
[87:07.51]There are going to be a lot of fun things in this game.
[87:10.69]We're going to be on this one.
[87:12.92]I don't know if I need to resize this.
[87:15.70]Yes, sir.
[87:16.22]If I need to resize the fucking screen, I will.
[87:23.50]Good luck, buddy.
[87:25.50]Good luck.
[87:25.80]Hey, it's Reece.
[87:26.87]I'm the agent in charge down here.
[87:29.07]We're real glad to see you.
[87:31.47]And we're running a little pushed on this thing, so try to keep up.
[87:34.87]This here's Pike.
[87:36.67]You're the new tactical expert.
[87:38.33]How are you?
[87:38.87]Right.
[87:39.41]Hop in.
[87:44.15]So I'm not driving the car.
[87:45.11]That's good.
[87:50.15]It's a pretty good JPEG quality.
[87:52.17]There's four others in town, and they're at your disposal.
[87:56.35]And what we're up against here is aliens that can take on human form.
[88:00.33]They could be disguised as townspeople to cover their activities.
[88:03.91]One of these guys is going to be... Welcome to the end of the world.
[88:06.62]Oh, man.
[88:09.02]I can't wait.
[88:10.14]We set up a command post here because of the central location.
[88:16.06]I can't wait for someone to turn into an alien.
[88:17.36]Beverly Hills it ain't.
[88:18.68]Just hope you do better than the last tactical operative.
[88:22.24]You're going to have to do better.
[88:24.64]You read the file, right?
[88:26.46]We've lost three tactical operatives in the last three weeks.
[88:29.41]Yeah, just gone.
[88:30.91]Like that.
[88:32.23]JPEG.
[88:32.91]This guy's a crap out of me.
[88:38.99]I really hope this is not one of those where if I fail, it's over.
[88:43.33]Good luck.
[88:45.41]Okay.
[88:50.98]And let's see.
[88:51.54]When do I get control?
[88:52.10]Because of the losses, we've gone to a battle cam set up.
[88:55.55]The town is rigged for picture.
[88:57.25]It's your eyes and ears at four critical locations.
[89:00.32]It's going to be another fucking camera game.
[89:01.58]It's going to be a camera game.
[89:03.96]Your fire control center consists of four particle beam disruptors with limited energy capacitors.
[89:08.50]So make smart decisions.
[89:09.19]We're in here.
[89:17.62]I'm gonna have to trap the aliens with my camera.
[89:19.45]Based on cell analysis, HQ has determined that these aliens must ingest a compatible life form in order to survive.
[89:25.73]Their constant cellular regeneration depends on it.
[89:30.55]Frankly, our best weapons can only stun these creeps.
[89:34.88]You gotta find a way to stop them.
[89:36.72]Five Nights at Freddy's in downtown Texas.
[89:39.36]Now, there'll be an agent in each locale, and you'll get a wave once you get set.
[89:42.98]Oh, God.
[89:43.60]I'll be on the street as well, gathering what intelligence I can on the disappearances.
[89:48.33]Now you're supposedly the best we've got.
[89:50.45]And we're counting on you to watch our backs and be there in the event that something goes wrong.
[89:55.65]Yeah.
[89:57.31]And there's one other thing.
[89:59.92]You're the last chance we have.
[90:01.74]This is the same actor from the other game too.
[90:04.32]HQ has a B-2 in the air with attack nuke.
[90:07.58]They're ready to drop it.
[90:10.13]So this game, it's the same engine for every single one of these games.
[90:16.67]Okay, top secret accessing battle cam.
[90:21.03]Piecing together, using like the... Using the 3D Studio Max.
[90:26.72]There's one, two, three, four.
[90:28.02]They're really dragging this out.
[90:35.55]So I can shoot with these traps.
[90:37.57]Okay.
[90:37.91]Go to three.
[90:43.72]No input received.
[90:45.48]Session will be terminated in three seconds.
[90:48.92]Look, okay.
[90:50.74]Select camera is A. Camera shield is B. And fire weapon is C. Okay.
[90:57.50]Got it.
[91:05.33]I didn't get it.
[91:12.27]Restart level one, please.
[91:21.60]It's like reading the disk very, very harshly.
[91:24.52]Okay.
[91:26.12]It's A in a direction.
[91:28.48]No, I don't want to see you build the dumb thing.
[91:31.32]What's going on?
[91:31.70]Okay.
[91:33.93]C is shoot the gun, right?
[91:37.09]Oh, shit!
[91:37.61]Not just a job.
[91:39.15]It's an adventure.
[91:46.56]The chopper's waiting!
[91:56.74]You're done!
[91:57.66]Is Hulkamania the fucking door down?
[92:00.00]Alright, let's restart the level again.
[92:06.79]Let's go.
[92:11.81]That guy is... That guy is strong, for sure.
[92:15.78]Alright, let's go to the fucking Plaza Square.
[92:17.94]No fucking wrong.
[92:18.78]Let's shoot the right alien.
[92:21.64]Shoot the right bad guy.
[92:28.40]Find the alien.
[92:31.23]I have to find the alien.
[92:34.35]This is so hard.
[92:36.97]Guys, I don't think you understand how fucking difficult this is.
[92:39.39]To, like, use this.
[92:42.05]I'm never gonna win.
[92:45.15]I won.
[92:46.69]How am I... Gotta go to one.
[92:51.02]Gotta go to one.
[92:54.38]Alien.
[92:56.46]Where's the alien?
[93:03.09]I gotta go back to three.
[93:03.85]Back to three.
[93:04.17]Back to three.
[93:04.57]Back to three.
[93:04.89]I don't care what you have to say.
[93:05.75]Fuck you.
[93:06.11]This town still needs to be attacked.
[93:09.33]That's like shot like Will Ferrell.
[93:14.70]Holy shit, this is fucking unbelievably difficult.
[93:17.00]I have to stay like on the one plane.
[93:21.28]Didn't get it.
[93:26.21]I go back up.
[93:28.45]What's going on here?
[93:33.93]Hot tacos.
[93:34.75]Oh, come on now.
[93:36.97]Everybody does the exact same death animation.
[93:45.46]Anybody at three?
[93:46.16]Three is okay still.
[93:52.42]Four is now in trouble.
[93:54.94]Down to four.
[94:04.64]This is so dumb.
[94:08.31]Don't you ever walk up in front of somebody that's aiming a gun out of the window.
[94:14.20]Was she just holding an ice cream?
[94:20.55]Was that a fucking ice cream sandwich?
[94:27.43]Texas feed tech.
[94:30.35]Two is now in trouble.
[94:31.42]Oh, for the love of fucking God.
[94:34.84]You gotta stay in the middle.
[94:35.52]It's just like whack-a-mole.
[94:36.94]You guys ever played whack-a-mole before?
[94:38.12]You have to stay in the middle.
[94:39.16]And, like, right when the thing comes out, you go and shoot it.
[94:42.36]Two.
[94:45.50]That's the strategy.
[94:46.80]You have to stay in the middle.
[94:50.16]Yeah.
[94:50.32]Okay.
[95:05.58]I was about to shoot this guy right in the face, but he's not gonna have any... Hold on.
[95:09.78]Right in the middle.
[95:12.74]I clearly shot that guy.
[95:13.86]You all saw that.
[95:14.50]That was bullshit.
[95:22.75]How much health do I have?
[95:25.49]You know, I'm also convinced it's the same fucking actor, by the way.
[95:32.21]It's like two actors doing this.
[95:36.33]Damn it Yeah, by the way what that guy's accent was a very thick East Coast accent What the hell is that guy doing down here?
[95:55.53]Down to four So at what point does this game end?
[96:11.63]I keep taking hits, but thankfully it's not doing very much.
[96:16.85]That's so hard to go up in like two planes.
[96:19.89]That guy had an elaborate death more than anybody else.
[96:26.42]Over to three.
[96:31.30]Also, this music is terrible too.
[96:33.29]Oh no.
[96:33.75]This is not good.
[96:35.85]Two is in trouble.
[96:37.77]And the screen is crashing.
[96:38.81]Alright, that lady just got knocked over by a gust of wind.
[96:48.77]What?
[96:50.81]I don't want the likes of you watching my back!
[96:53.39]The chopper's waiting!
[96:54.45]You're done!
[97:08.45]I can put it, apparently I can put a shield on.
[97:15.16]Alright, let's do another one.
[97:18.94]That was definitely worth doing just for the guy fucking breaking the door down.
[97:26.95]What else we got?
[97:28.13]Oh, we got, oh, don't worry, we got lots more.
[97:33.89]Like this one.
[97:38.16]This one is called Midnight Raiders.
[97:46.36]Midnight Raiders.
[97:57.06]Hey.
[97:58.58]If this was another trap game, I swear to God.
[98:01.58]We were just playing a glorified trap game, by the way.
[98:09.32]Thank you all.
[98:10.64]I didn't miss anybody.
[98:13.99]Emperor William, thanks for the two bucks.
[98:15.41]The four bucks, actually.
[98:16.29]Tub Tucker, thank you for the bits.
[98:19.33]Real Bob, thank you for the bits.
[98:20.53]Glazed Donut, thank you for the bits.
[98:23.39]Jason Dartson, the real Bob again.
[98:24.91]Zach2540 for the bits.
[98:26.79]Five dollars.
[98:29.67]What is happening here, by the way?
[98:35.25]It's just a series of noises.
[98:37.29]I think the game crashed.
[98:41.31]Uh... This game, uh... I think this game might be toast.
[98:51.69]The CD's just damaged.
[98:53.53]Oh, shit.
[98:54.23]Hold on.
[98:54.59]Now I can hear it, like, trying to spin.
[98:57.98]Give me a second.
[98:58.46]Let's take a look.
[99:04.27]Oh, this CD sure is fucked up on the bottom.
[99:06.27]Let's try this again.
[99:09.29]Yeah, there is quite a bit of damage on this CD.
[99:15.20]Let's see if it works.
[99:18.40]Don't you guys worry.
[99:19.22]There are plenty more fucking games to play.
[99:23.14]We might not even be able to get through them all tonight.
[99:28.38]Let's try it again.
[99:30.72]Come on, run.
[99:31.27]Run.
[99:35.43]Run, dude.
[99:42.84]Shit.
[99:46.46]God damn it.
[99:46.94]This one could have been funny, too.
[99:50.87]Ah.
[99:55.03]Oh, well.
[99:56.95]Sorry.
[99:57.45]Time to move on to the next one.
[100:09.15]This one is... This one was advertised, like, three different times.
[100:12.50]There we go.
[100:15.56]And... There it is.
[100:19.50]And turn it on.
[100:23.12]Let's wait about if I get any more disk errors.
[100:27.74]Sonic CD?
[100:28.38]I do not have Sonic CD.
[100:30.98]Ow!
[100:31.16]Why would I want to play Sonic CD?
[100:35.04]It's just the same fucking game.
[100:36.90]It's like Sonic 3 Remastered.
[100:46.89]Same fucking goddamn company.
[100:54.61]This company made all these games.
[100:57.86]But this is a sports game.
[100:58.88]What, am I gonna trap somebody?
[101:00.00]Here comes another trap game.
[101:08.99]No, this is a real game.
[101:14.06]You direct as the company.
[101:15.90]Here we go.
[101:16.60]Prizefighter.
[101:24.42]Oh, starring Jimmy Nickelodeon.
[101:32.40]John Madden.
[101:35.12]Wait, you play real games?
[101:36.91]Come on, give me like a... I just beat all of Red Dead Redemption like fucking last week.
[101:42.34]I played Red Dead Redemption, which is like a good game.
[101:44.83]I beat the whole fucking thing.
[101:46.07]So we're playing a bunch of shitty Night Trap games, like tonight.
[101:51.21]Give me a break.
[101:55.23]I just beat all of Red Dead Redemption on Nickelodeon.
[102:00.33]Alright, let's see what this one entails.
[102:10.88]This is a- this is just a boxing game, by the way, guys.
[102:13.90]I don't think there's anything special about this.
[102:19.16]It might be- Okay, I'm done.
[102:23.87]Get- So I'm the kid, alright.
[102:26.61]Which one of these reporters am I punching in the face?
[102:38.62]Is that fucking fat Gilbert Godfrey?
[102:44.47]He begged me to bring him.
[102:46.39]He always wanted to be a boxer.
[102:48.77]Until the tragedy.
[102:50.43]Put it for me, Mr. Kidd.
[102:51.95]Tragedy?
[102:52.49]Come on, come on, kid.
[102:53.21]Let's go.
[102:53.85]Watch him, please.
[102:54.83]Let us in, please.
[102:56.63]Come on.
[102:56.93]That was like fucking loud.
[102:58.15]Actually pretty dark.
[103:01.95]Alright, here we go.
[103:03.57]Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.
[103:05.97]Tonight, we have four of the biggest and baddest, fiercest and meanest fighters this side of Thermonuclear War.
[103:18.16]Okay, I just kind of zoned out for a second.
[103:20.44]He just said it's this Thermonuclear War.
[103:22.64]You better be ready for me, punk.
[103:26.00]C for options.
[103:27.69]I love how this is like a fucking, this is like in the Harry Potter universe, apparently.
[103:32.38]Living newspapers.
[103:33.30]Alright, so 190 pounds, 703 power points.
[103:38.94]And I'm the kid.
[103:41.33]C for options.
[103:43.11]Power points, save game, restore game, delete game, control changes, training mode.
[103:47.81]Should I do the training mode?
[103:49.77]I think I should put on the training wheels.
[103:51.49]Training mode on.
[103:54.67]Okay.
[103:55.93]I don't know how to play, though.
[103:56.81]You better be ready for me, punk.
[104:01.92]I turned on the training, so there we go.
[104:03.57]I think I forgot his lines.
[104:30.20]These are the rules.
[104:31.58]No rabbit punches, no low blows.
[104:33.54]In case of a knockdown, go to a neutral corner.
[104:37.24]What's a rabbit punch?
[104:38.48]I tell you to come out.
[104:40.00]Is that clear?
[104:40.50]Have a good fight.
[104:43.86]Why is everybody talking so down to me?
[104:45.26]This is it, kid.
[104:45.92]Let's do it.
[104:46.44]I'm supposed to do the tutorial.
[104:52.05]What's the tutorial?
[104:52.89]Does them tell me no rabbit punches?
[105:00.76]Alright, let's play.
[105:03.18]A rabbit punch is a punch in the back of the head.
[105:07.69]Oh, okay.
[105:21.29]Alright, now watch me have a bunch of cameras to, like, drop people down.
[105:26.58]Is that me?
[105:27.02]I think that's me.
[105:30.48]Why is this recorded on my old VCR?
[105:32.28]Because this game came out during the period of the VCR.
[105:37.42]That's why.
[105:42.14]Round one, round one.
[105:44.66]They're really setting this up.
[105:49.63]Alright, let's go.
[105:54.21]There's the bell.
[105:54.99]The fight starts now.
[106:01.39]Oh, alright, apparently that's it.
[106:05.53]Whoa, okay.
[106:18.20]It's just different... Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[106:25.78]Hey, get off me.
[106:35.17]What?
[106:35.39]I don't understand.
[106:36.01]What does it want me to do?
[106:40.22]None of us have hit each other in like at least a few minutes.
[106:45.90]Lehigh, at least it's a 60 FPS.
[106:50.34]That's a good thing, right?
[106:51.48]So that's a right punch.
[106:56.47]Dude, I... It's giving me these on-screen prompts.
[107:02.99]And I don't know if any of these things are working.
[107:08.73]I wish this guy would get the fuck off me.
[107:11.45]I mean, this is a kind of cool idea back in the day, but... I got him.
[107:20.49]I punched him.
[107:25.72]I guess at Tate, you just kind of have to get it in the right spot.
[107:30.62]I'm getting fucking destroyed.
[107:31.64]I really am.
[107:37.52]Dude, the on-screen prompts don't really make any sense.
[107:41.10]He uses it like the fucking gut punch sound.
[107:44.44]Am I on the ground?
[107:49.91]Oh my god.
[107:55.59]Yeah, is that like blood?
[107:56.61]Alright, go.
[108:05.34]I think I understand.
[108:06.86]Yeah, I get it.
[108:08.24]I think I get it now.
[108:10.72]Yep.
[108:14.35]It's up and down, too.
[108:19.89]He's like, he's kind of fucked up right now.
[108:21.13]I'm going to knock him down.
[108:22.55]Last punch.
[108:22.89]Right in the face.
[108:23.37]Come on.
[108:27.79]Come on.
[108:28.11]Get him knocked down.
[108:30.72]He just went for like a haymaker.
[108:31.74]How did none of those land?
[108:38.04]How are none of these punches hitting this guy?
[108:48.52]Apparently my arms cannot reach this guy's face.
[108:52.78]There, I got him.
[108:53.32]I got him in the stomach one time.
[109:01.05]Break plane!
[109:11.91]Okay.
[109:13.31]I guess I went down again.
[109:14.35]That's the round.
[109:34.58]Well, alright.
[109:35.54]That was pretty good.
[109:36.20]So, uh...
[109:43.76]There's arrows on the screen.
[109:45.50]I asked for the tutorial and I just didn't get it.
[109:48.82]They didn't give it to me.
[109:50.14]Fuck you, lady.
[109:52.30]I need to listen.
[109:55.26]This is my dodge.
[110:17.28]It's always like... I hit him once.
[110:28.23]I'm trying to figure out things to say right now, but I have nothing to say.
[110:31.55]This is not like Punch-Out.
[110:36.23]Punch-Out's a way better game.
[110:37.35]That came out in 1996 too, didn't it?
[110:46.37]I wish he would stop grabbing me.
[110:47.49]Alright, we're just gonna fucking spam every button.
[110:57.63]That's how you do it.
[110:58.17]You spam every button, you just jab him in the face over and over again.
[111:00.31]Eventually he's gonna go down.
[111:09.01]He favors his left hand so much.
[111:10.93]Dodge right.
[111:12.89]What?
[111:20.93]Imagine playing this game.
[111:22.55]Well, you don't have to imagine.
[111:23.59]I'm here.
[111:23.89]Dude, this is not right.
[111:33.88]Okay, he just did an off-the-ropes fucking clothesline.
[111:41.89]I might like that the screen's going dark.
[111:49.99]Okay, I'm fucking almost done with this shit.
[111:59.51]Okay, this might be the worst game of the whole night.
[112:04.04]Fuck this.
[112:05.96]I'm not gonna... No, I don't want to keep doing this.
[112:20.51]Why won't my punches hit him?
[112:22.91]He's like right in range.
[112:24.04]I can't fucking hit this guy.
[112:25.20]He doesn't like take punches.
[112:26.34]He just comes in and grabs you.
[112:27.46]I can knock him out.
[112:38.79]Man, the kid's not going to stay down for long.
[112:50.86]Here comes the next one.
[112:53.54]There's no rhyme or reason to that fucking game.
[112:55.51]Alright, the next one that I want to play is Upstairs.
[113:05.13]I forgot it.
[113:05.63]It's Upstairs.
[113:06.13]Give me one second.
[113:06.65]I'll be right back.
[113:07.32]I'm going to go grab it.
[115:03.70]Okay.
[115:04.50]We're back.
[115:08.11]This time we're playing... This one I think is the one that I wanted to... I wanted to play this one the most.
[115:14.51]By far.
[115:16.17]This is a game called Wirehead.
[115:21.63]This is the whole reason for the stream besides Night Trap.
[115:25.77]So pray that this game is fun because this is the fucking reason why I wanted to do it.
[115:41.91]Wire head.
[115:43.55]Indicator on.
[115:44.85]That's fine, I'm going to assume.
[115:50.72]Here we go.
[115:53.24]Pray this game is fun.
[116:07.55]Touch TV production, Wirehead.
[116:15.57]It looks this fucking video.
[116:19.01]Oh shit, dad's dead.
[116:23.43]Package for Ned Hubbard.
[116:24.77]That's me.
[116:25.19]They're controlling dad with their game gear.
[116:37.02]you guys have any idea how this is gonna be fun I told you kids not to play with your father's controller yeah dad you controlled dad with your genesis hey thanks for the package
[117:04.73]That was pretty impressive though.
[117:05.79]Dad doing like three back handsprings.
[117:08.96]Let's put in a VHS.
[117:16.04]Ned, I don't know how to say this.
[117:19.48]They've tortured me.
[117:21.08]They've killed my nurse.
[117:23.02]And now they're after you.
[117:25.30]I escaped.
[117:26.88]But I don't know how long before they find me.
[117:28.90]It's just an episode of Black Mirror.
[117:31.26]I've got to go.
[117:32.48]I'll be getting in touch with you very soon.
[117:35.12]In the meantime, I've got someone watching over you with my controller.
[117:39.74]It's me.
[117:40.48]I'm watching you.
[117:41.24]I love how I've just been in this guy's house and he doesn't even notice that I'm here.
[117:46.66]Mr. Ned Hubbard?
[117:48.70]Yes.
[117:49.58]My name is Frank Ross.
[117:50.88]This is my partner, Will Kramer.
[117:52.70]We're with the FBI.
[117:54.54]I'd like it if you'd come with us and answer a few questions.
[117:56.79]I'm not going with the FBI.
[117:58.25]Why?
[117:58.91]About what?
[118:00.21]It's no big deal.
[118:00.97]Just a few routine questions about Dr. Ohan and staff.
[118:06.01]But I don't know where he is.
[118:09.30]How did you know he disappeared?
[118:11.92]Adrenaline surge detected.
[118:12.96]Hyperventilating.
[118:13.56]Remote control activated.
[118:16.84]I have to go.
[118:19.26]Go.
[118:19.54]Go right.
[118:22.11]Here they come.
[118:25.23]Straight.
[118:27.27]That was the Bluetooth in my ear.
[118:28.77]Out the back door.
[118:29.33]Where did he come from?
[118:34.04]That doesn't seem like a very secure... What?
[118:43.68]What's going on?
[118:44.18]How did that guy get all the way out here?
[118:54.59]I lost again.
[118:55.29]Alright, well... Looks like we're disconnected again.
[119:04.37]So this time we're gonna go left.
[119:06.03]Left.
[119:08.71]Okay, good.
[119:09.15]He fell.
[119:10.25]Not straight this time.
[119:10.87]We're gonna go left this time.
[119:11.61]Left.
[119:13.49]Out the window.
[119:15.86]Good job.
[119:18.96]You couldn't do that any fucking slower.
[119:20.86]Are you serious?
[119:23.50]You a toddler.
[119:25.07]You can't get out the fucking window.
[119:30.97]Hopes fade for wirehead.
[119:32.45]Wait, that's it?
[119:33.15]There they come!
[119:37.01]Okay, looks like we gotta go straight.
[119:38.23]Up the stairs.
[119:38.59]I love how that guy dives every time.
[119:42.48]That's a stuntman for sure.
[119:43.48]Now he slipped on a fucking tennis ball.
[119:45.26]This is...
[119:49.95]There's only one fucking way you can go.
[119:51.85]Why is this guy such a fucking klutz?
[119:54.11]This is just Mario Maker.
[120:02.28]Alright, uh... Left.
[120:08.04]And then right or straight?
[120:09.60]I don't understand.
[120:10.32]Which way?
[120:12.50]Right.
[120:15.37]Through the back door.
[120:16.41]Into the bedroom.
[120:18.93]Left.
[120:19.15]Left.
[120:27.52]We have to get out of the fucking house, okay?
[120:29.46]Like, eventually, we're just gonna... It's just trial and error.
[120:35.16]Right.
[120:39.39]Alright, let's just... Spray.
[120:42.97]We're going out the door again.
[120:45.43]He's gonna grab me in a fucking headlock again.
[120:47.03]He's gonna say, Hey, I got you.
[120:48.57]What's going on here?
[120:58.80]Wirehead's brutal twist of fate.
[121:02.89]How many more times do I- can I please get out of the fucking house?
[121:07.83]So I don't go- I have to go right, and then right again.
[121:11.21]Right.
[121:11.43]That's right again.
[121:13.31]That's the only other way.
[121:20.68]It's just- it's just the other door to the outside, by the way, guys.
[121:24.34]Straight.
[121:25.84]I'm getting on the fucking little kid's bicycle.
[121:31.32]Why wouldn't I get in the car?
[121:34.40]Dead in the fucking car.
[121:35.66]Why would you get on the little kid's bike?
[121:37.43]Alright, we're gonna go left.
[121:46.39]Okay, we're gonna do it.
[121:49.38]We're gonna take a right up here.
[121:52.64]Okay, this time, go out the right door, not the left door, because it matters.
[121:59.29]Out here.
[121:59.85]Instead of going straight, we're gonna hit right.
[122:03.21]Alright.
[122:03.73]Oh, right.
[122:04.25]Again.
[122:06.19]This time, get in the car.
[122:08.05]You fucking moron.
[122:09.45]Back over the guy.
[122:14.52]Do I have to control the car?
[122:17.24]I got blocked in.
[122:17.96]Okay, um... Put it in... What are you doing?
[122:23.00]What were you thinking?
[122:24.58]You were gonna make a getaway in a family wagon?
[122:27.63]Put it in fucking drive, dude!
[122:29.07]This guy, nobody has any guns!
[122:34.87]Honest to god, these guys don't have weapons.
[122:37.39]Just drive over them.
[122:38.91]Smash into the fucking car!
[122:43.63]Why is this guy so inept at everything?
[122:48.73]So what, I would have to get on like the skateboard?
[122:51.29]So the car is not the correct option.
[122:53.61]It's the skateboard.
[122:58.60]No, fuck it.
[122:59.36]I'm gonna get tackled.
[123:04.16]Apparently that was the right thing to do.
[123:09.70]Okay, I think we've lost.
[123:15.06]Fleeing Professor Snatch skateboarder terrorizes neighborhood?
[123:21.41]That's not what happened.
[123:24.97]That is absolutely not what happened.
[123:33.24]Alright, well we know how to get there.
[123:35.32]You didn't think we were gonna fucking beat this game?
[123:38.83]You guys didn't think we were gonna beat this fucking entire game?
[123:43.97]We're getting to the very end of this game.
[123:45.37]I knew this one was a keeper.
[123:47.57]Right.
[123:49.25]Skateboard then left.
[123:50.05]That's what I'm gonna say.
[123:54.93]Yep, out the store.
[123:55.87]We still have full battery power.
[123:59.99]Get on the fucking scrape board.
[124:01.75]And then left.
[124:03.17]We're gonna bang a left because he pulls in front of us.
[124:07.13]I'm sure left or right will work.
[124:09.59]Left.
[124:11.73]Nice.
[124:14.85]Are they following me on the road?
[124:16.41]Right.
[124:21.16]Wait, how do I have control in the air?
[124:22.90]How did I have...
[124:30.44]What?
[124:30.98]I... Oh, good, we got a big... No, shit!
[124:41.38]Hold on.
[124:44.82]No, no, wait, wait, wait.
[124:45.86]I didn't know we were gonna start from the beginning like that.
[124:48.49]Left.
[124:49.67]Left.
[124:51.31]Holy shit, this guy sucks.
[124:55.55]Get up.
[124:57.15]Oh my god.
[124:59.35]So we have to go straight.
[125:08.62]Wirehead loses his head.
[125:10.12]That's fine.
[125:10.98]Straight.
[125:13.26]No!
[125:13.58]Why is it starting me from here?
[125:14.90]It started me from the other point last time!
[125:17.60]Oh my fucking god.
[125:20.50]Left, and then straight.
[125:24.90]Straight.
[125:28.33]There we go.
[125:30.45]Right.
[125:32.35]Nice.
[125:34.87]Are we good?
[125:37.25]I'm not gonna be able to memorize this shit.
[125:38.81]Oh shit, old lady with groceries.
[125:41.23]Straight.
[125:41.71]Fucking just crash into her.
[125:42.86]Who cares?
[125:43.38]Fuck her.
[125:43.68]Alright, I stole her fucking Oreos.
[125:55.72]This is just trial and error, the video game.
[126:00.74]This is so stupid.
[126:02.32]I don't remember the inputs, by the way.
[126:03.78]I don't remember.
[126:05.72]Where's it gonna put me?
[126:07.22]Right.
[126:08.88]Lady with the groceries.
[126:09.98]Ram into her.
[126:15.30]Straight into her.
[126:18.13]And then we gotta go right.
[126:19.15]Right.
[126:19.43]Nice.
[126:20.19]Around it.
[126:29.09]I just dropped, like, eggs on somebody.
[126:30.47]Okay, I went left.
[126:31.41]Watch out for the guys holding the couch.
[126:34.49]I'm gonna go right.
[126:37.71]I just got run over by a car.
[126:43.51]It's just a... It's a skateboard.
[126:45.89]It terrorizes a neighborhood.
[126:50.79]I... I don't... I...
[126:58.83]Should I just drive into the guys carrying the couch?
[127:00.89]I don't remember.
[127:03.87]I don't remember.
[127:04.57]It's so hard to keep track of all these fucking times to move.
[127:09.80]And it was... Right.
[127:12.72]Through the lady with the groceries.
[127:14.62]And then right.
[127:15.62]And then through the guys with the couch.
[127:20.04]Straight through.
[127:20.50]Righty!
[127:27.55]Then he spills the eggs, we go right, and then I'm gonna go straight through the guys on the couch.
[127:35.10]Wait, what?
[127:40.09]No!
[127:42.05]What the fuck?
[127:43.45]What?
[127:43.79]Dude, I hit... Oh my fucking god.
[128:00.36]I just pressed left and it didn't work.
[128:06.35]I gotta remember this too.
[128:08.17]I did it wrong already.
[128:09.73]Maybe I didn't.
[128:18.74]Yeah, I didn't.
[128:21.90]Focus on the task.
[128:23.08]Dude, it's just guess.
[128:30.75]I literally just have to memorize the entire fucking game.
[128:33.88]Left, right, up, left, right, right, left, right, left, right.
[128:35.98]I'm not going to be able to do that shit.
[128:40.10]That's, like, absurd.
[128:48.52]Skateboard, yeah.
[128:50.44]It's not straight, right?
[128:51.49]Is it left or right?
[128:52.61]I think it's left.
[128:56.67]It's never explained why they're even after you in the first place.
[129:01.16]Am I good?
[129:01.56]And then, I don't remember.
[129:03.40]I think it's straight.
[129:05.12]No, it's not.
[129:06.42]Yes, it is.
[129:08.48]Right?
[129:10.08]Okay.
[129:11.62]Here comes the lady with the groceries.
[129:14.89]And then it's left.
[129:16.83]Or is it left or is it right?
[129:19.33]After the groceries, is it right?
[129:22.95]It's right after the groceries.
[129:29.11]There go the eggs.
[129:30.68]And it's right?
[129:32.40]Fuck!
[129:34.31]It's not right!
[129:38.73]Oh god dammit.
[129:41.03]Whoa!
[129:44.87]Oh my fucking god.
[129:52.64]It's left after eggs?
[129:53.82]That's what I just did?
[129:54.58]Why is it putting me back here?! !
[129:59.90]I just landed in this lady's car.
[130:03.30]What the fuck?
[130:07.83]Why did I land in her car this time?
[130:15.13]I don't have control of the car.
[130:21.74]So, well, how... This is a secret ending, yeah.
[130:25.54]Well, this is the actual way to do it.
[130:32.86]Alright, we lost him.
[130:33.68]Good.
[130:35.84]On to mission two.
[130:44.09]I guess I'm still being chased.
[130:46.33]I'm going right.
[130:48.17]Go to the police officer and ask for help.
[130:51.31]What?
[130:55.05]Did I just go into the fucking security check?
[131:01.27]Wouldn't I be like, wait, and now I'm on a fucking airplane?
[131:11.64]What are you doing in here?
[131:12.90]I was just making sure my bags got on the plane.
[131:16.03]No one is allowed in this room, sir.
[131:17.57]Now, I suggest you take your seat.
[131:19.99]Right away.

[131:57.19]Thanks for the last.
[131:58.18]I told you this one was gonna be good.
[131:59.60]Thank you, though.
[132:00.20]Appreciate it.
[132:01.18]Did it just say I was getting, like, turned on?
[132:20.47]Yeah, I was just getting turned on.
[132:21.97]I was sitting next to a fat man back there who snores like a water buffalo.
[132:26.23]Alright, left, right, or straight.
[132:27.63]I don't know.
[132:28.11]You guys pick the next one.
[132:28.91]You're not going to believe this.
[132:31.72]What?
[132:31.98]Airport security's just called.
[132:33.68]They think we might have a murderer on board.
[132:36.70]My name is Frances Mars.
[132:38.30]And yours?
[132:40.26]Ned Hubbard.
[132:41.14]A fucking murderer?
[132:42.28]Really?
[132:43.51]Aren't you the one that they call Wyatt?
[132:45.05]Why am I a murderer?
[132:46.31]I just was on a skateboard and like rode around on the street.
[132:49.47]Ned Hubbard.
[132:50.57]What a Mr. Ned Hubbard.
[132:51.77]Please press the passenger call button.
[132:54.43]Oh, shit.
[132:55.40]That's you, isn't it?
[132:56.44]I have an idea.
[133:00.88]She's gonna kiss me.
[133:02.06]Follow me.
[133:02.68]Oh, no.
[133:03.48]No, I... Oh, God.
[133:06.30]It's gonna be left.
[133:07.16]We're gonna go left.
[133:08.04]That's the predetermined way we're gonna go.
[133:10.96]We're on an airplane, by the way.
[133:12.08]Where am I supposed to go?
[133:14.60]Exit is to the right.
[133:16.48]Let's hide in here.
[133:17.42]I don't trust her.
[133:18.34]We're going right.
[133:22.94]I can't jump out of a plane!
[133:25.40]Damn it!
[133:29.48]Hold on, did the lady just... Hold on, it worked!
[133:41.97]It fucking worked!
[133:45.01]It actually worked.
[133:51.66]Left.
[133:52.54]You just do the doggy paddle, you'll get out of there.
[133:58.02]He turned the boat into a parachute and landed in the water and now I'm safe.
[134:01.55]This game's fucking unbelievable.
[134:03.15]We have to play this game like four more times to win.
[134:08.88]Oh, well, uh, lookie here.
[134:10.92]Look who just popped out of the sky.
[134:12.46]We've been looking for you, sonny.
[134:13.56]He's gonna come.
[134:13.96]Right this way.
[134:14.92]Come on, now.
[134:15.70]Grab his gun.
[134:16.12]Don't give me any trouble.
[134:17.24]Now what?
[134:18.54]Come on.
[134:19.62]That's it.
[134:20.06]What?
[134:21.32]Okay, so don't go.
[134:22.22]Don't go left.
[134:26.68]Whoa!
[134:27.14]Look at that.
[134:27.56]I got a gun on you.
[134:28.40]I'm just a guy.
[134:29.23]You lose.
[134:29.97]What?
[134:30.11]Alright, we'll just fucking... Let's go in over the waterfall.
[134:34.23]Screw it.
[134:35.45]If there's police here that are looking for me...
[134:38.55]Am I okay?
[134:42.27]Oh, okay.
[134:52.06]This guy is so lucky.
[134:56.48]Climb up it.
[134:57.22]Climb up.
[134:58.80]You can do it.
[135:00.26]Just shimmy your weight up there.
[135:06.10]I guess that didn't work.
[135:10.10]Should I go down?
[135:14.19]God.
[135:14.57]This guy can't even walk up the stairs correctly, but he can somehow float to the surface.
[135:19.99]He has the amount of strength to hold on to that the whole fucking time.
[135:23.34]Thanks, man.
[135:24.40]What?
[135:32.62]I love how this guy needs somebody with a controller in the hand to tell him what to do.
[135:36.90]And it's just such simple tasks like walk, or like turn.
[135:40.93]Alright, let's go just slide down it.
[135:43.75]Like shimmy down.
[135:44.39]Oh, f***.
[135:47.97]God, dude.
[135:50.53]Well, it's not down.
[135:53.54]It's not down.
[135:54.52]Waterlogged wire head jumps a thousand feet falls.
[135:57.64]Okay.
[136:00.02]Oh, s***.
[136:01.83]Alright, we're gonna try this one differently this time.
[136:03.39]Should I?
[136:03.69]Let's hide in there.
[136:08.11]We're gonna see the other outcomes.
[136:10.79]Oh my fucking god, don't take your clothes off.
[136:18.52]They've just both broke the foot of this huge knife.
[136:30.69]Let's hide in here.
[136:32.75]Oh, well, yeah, I guess we're jumping out the fucking door.
[136:37.17]Well, we found the murderer.
[136:38.31]It's the lady with the fucking gigantic knife.
[136:42.83]So, yeah, we have to go left or right.
[136:56.06]Go down the waterfall, then go left.
[136:57.68]We'll try that.
[136:58.36]Or right.
[136:58.82]We're gonna try right.
[137:01.07]Hey!
[137:02.41]You're good!
[137:03.07]We've heard a lot of that.
[137:12.67]Let's try running.
[137:14.89]Where'd the raft come from?
[137:16.94]That's like the emergency slide for the plane.
[137:20.96]Right.
[137:22.58]I just said right.
[137:27.74]That's all he had to do.
[137:33.25]That was a barrel This turn to the camera was just like oh, I'm in some trouble here.
[137:49.52]Oh
[138:04.23]It was just two people in a fucking barricade.
[138:07.63]How did they film that?
[138:09.09]Dude, that was a fucking trained professional.
[138:22.88]That person actually was getting, like, grabbed and bit by a bear.
[138:26.46]That was a real bear.
[138:27.64]This is back in the fucking, like, 90s, dude.
[138:29.88]That was no CGI bullshit.
[138:32.04]That was a real bear killing a guy on camera.
[138:41.48]Left.
[138:47.92]Wait, this is different.
[138:49.22]This is different.
[138:52.48]Oh, shit, it's over.
[139:04.67]Multiple takes.
[139:08.93]Oh, my God.
[139:10.79]I'm not stopping this game.
[139:12.63]I don't care what anybody says.
[139:13.63]We're staying on this.
[139:14.62]We have to get to the end.
[139:17.02]I just have to remember fucking half these things.
[139:20.32]Let's go.
[139:22.29]Okay, it's left.
[139:25.64]Going back this far.
[139:26.90]Oh, come on.
[139:27.78]I can't blow this.
[139:34.88]And then it's right again.
[139:36.48]Skateboard.
[139:39.09]It really is too good to stop.
[139:40.45]We have to win.
[139:43.98]I love how the skateboard is very clearly lit up.
[139:47.68]And bright.
[139:48.22]And then it's left.
[139:50.00]I think it's left.
[139:52.62]This part confuses me every time, man.
[139:54.17]I'm just gonna fly off and land in her car.
[139:58.97]Okay.
[140:00.55]There we go.
[140:01.79]Fly off.
[140:02.83]Into her car.
[140:05.15]Got it.
[140:05.98]We got full fucking battery, too.
[140:07.54]Full battery.
[140:18.36]Dive through security.
[140:19.38]Every person you've ever seen play this game loves it.
[140:27.69]It's really something else.
[140:29.81]Well, it's just absurd.
[140:31.15]Yeah, we're good.
[140:37.97]Make sure we dive to the right.
[140:39.97]I mean, we could try a different avenue here.
[140:44.17]I'm gonna try.
[140:44.79]You know, we know the security on the plane thing, but what about like straight through?
[140:47.59]What happens if I sprint in there?
[140:51.69]Straight in.
[140:52.05]Let's just try it.
[140:52.77]Okay.
[141:11.82]Without questions asked about, alright, I just wanted to see what happened.
[141:15.10]Let's just dive into the security thing.
[141:16.46]I don't know, stick to the plan.
[141:19.36]I understand, stick to the plan.
[141:24.07]Express check-in, there we go.
[141:29.49]Dive out the plane, then it's right, and then we're at the bear, and I don't know what to do.
[141:35.99]I think I can skip this, right?
[141:38.79]Yeah.
[141:44.40]I don't know what straight does.
[141:46.96]No time for that.
[141:47.64]Stick to the plan.
[141:48.40]I can't jump out of a plane.
[141:52.75]Danger, danger, danger.
[141:54.73]Here we go.
[141:56.87]Through the waterfall, here it comes.
[142:03.89]Whoa, here we go.
[142:13.74]Hey, you're good!
[142:16.52]I love his laugh.
[142:20.24]Alright, now we go right.
[142:28.65]We're at the bear.
[142:29.47]I'm gonna just try to run straight.
[142:33.13]No fucking around.
[142:33.83]We can outrun a bear.
[142:37.87]I'm pretty sure I can outrun a bear.
[142:40.49]Bears can only run like fucking 9 miles per hour.
[142:46.78]There you go.
[142:50.42]Run.
[142:50.96]No!
[142:51.32]I wanted to just run!
[142:52.26]Help!
[142:55.24]Help!
[142:56.94]Okay, another death from the bear.
[142:59.34]We have to go down.
[143:02.40]The bear punched me in the face.
[143:10.60]That's three deaths from the bear.
[143:14.69]DSA to everyone, you cannot outrun a bear.
[143:30.04]Just give it, like, total false fucking knowledge.
[143:33.84]See, like, I better, like, preface that by saying there's no scientific evidence.
[143:37.58]I said that as a joke.
[143:38.51]Dude, if you see a bear, do not try to run away from it.
[143:42.45]Just throw a fucking handful of fucking snacks at it and then run.
[143:49.61]What the fuck am I doing?
[143:50.81]There you go, play dead.
[143:55.13]Don't do that either, by the way.
[143:56.43]That's a bad thing to do too, right?
[144:00.24]You gotta throw like... Throw like a fucking carton of Haagen-Dazs and then run.
[144:10.72]He's gone.
[144:13.64]Look at that artifacting on my back.
[144:16.00]That's something else.
[144:21.89]Okay, I got away from that situation.
[144:23.63]We're good.
[144:30.26]Where are we?
[144:32.80]Are we in the Wild West?
[144:37.86]How the fuck did we get to the Wild West?
[144:45.93]Where does this guy live?
[144:52.36]This is a pig?
[144:54.26]That pig was having sex with something.
[145:00.52]Alright, well, we're time traveling now.
[145:05.03]That's fine.
[145:05.91]None of these people here want to kill me.
[145:07.17]That's good.
[145:08.13]Fucking roast as a drinking booze.
[145:16.63]Oh, I just put a costume on.
[145:18.09]Okay.
[145:19.75]I'm playing the part now.
[145:22.91]Adrenaline surge detected.
[145:23.95]Remote control active.
[145:26.01]I just went right.
[145:31.31]Got it.
[145:32.43]Good.
[145:33.09]Just do it like Hitman.
[145:37.20]Straight, I guess, to the bar.
[145:40.14]Just like Hitman.
[145:40.76]You can just blend in.
[145:41.64]Oh.
[146:00.05]No, god damn it.
[146:01.55]We have to go all the way back to this shit.
[146:10.72]That killed me.
[146:11.94]He threw me over the bar and I died instantly.
[146:14.58]Shit, I hit the wrong fucking button.
[146:20.32]I hit the wrong button.
[146:28.07]I was trying to...
[146:35.40]God, come on.
[146:39.74]No, I'm not.
[146:40.82]So how do you survive that if you don't survive if you just jump up?
[146:54.55]How much did this game cost?
[146:55.57]This game, I think, was like 20 bucks.
[147:04.90]Or maybe it was like 12, I don't remember.
[147:09.26]Down.
[147:09.66]I can't believe I didn't get a checkpoint.
[147:13.84]Well, this is so worth it.
[147:16.04]This is the best world we've played so far.
[147:19.34]This is easily worth like the 10 to 20 dollars it was.
[147:22.14]And like the 150 fucking dollars it was for the SEGA CD.
[147:29.16]Just for this, this was like 200 bucks.
[147:32.56]Just to play this on stream.
[147:35.18]It was worth it.
[147:36.18]Absolutely.
[147:42.49]I will own this forever.
[147:44.53]I own a physical copy of this game.
[147:46.23]Forever, in a case.
[147:47.81]Worth it.
[147:48.27]Alright, here we go.
[147:55.87]We can skip this.
[147:56.65]We go right.
[147:57.37]In the campo scene.
[148:03.07]Then we don't go straight, because that's the bar.
[148:08.48]Wait.
[148:08.60]So, okay, so now we walk by these guys.
[148:11.02]I'm going to say left.
[148:12.76]Talk to the chicken.
[148:16.35]Left.
[148:18.87]Howdy.
[148:19.63]Nice hat.
[148:20.61]Thank you.
[148:21.09]Where'd you get it?
[148:22.45]Oh, a store.
[148:23.45]General store.
[148:24.55]Looks awfully familiar to me.
[148:27.30]Sure does.
[148:28.20]Oh, yeah?
[148:29.32]Sure does.
[148:30.54]Sure does.
[148:31.54]Is this guy's hat?
[148:32.44]M-O-O-S-E.
[148:35.54]Moose.
[148:35.96]Oh, no.
[148:37.30]That's my hat.
[148:38.45]Combat program activated.
[148:39.83]You know what we do with hat wrestlers?
[148:48.55]No.
[148:49.93]I got punched.
[148:52.68]Okay, that's how you punch.
[148:55.62]And now I'm arrested.
[149:00.60]No, I'm not arrested.
[149:05.39]New mechanics and I'm still alive.
[149:06.93]I'm still good.
[149:11.90]Once the guy on the left for no reason that's true I'm Laura Levin with the times and gentlemen we have a very serious problem Your prisoner here is accused of killing a man that he didn't kill and the real killers are in fact on their way here this minute To kill him yeah, I wouldn't worry a pretty little head a guy left was like chewing gum, and I punched him They're going to kill you him me anybody to get to him I
[149:37.76]You cannot save in this game.
[149:39.98]I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I know this.
[149:43.52]Our prisoner is safe.
[149:44.75]That's right.
[149:46.79]Well, may I at least speak to the prisoner then?
[149:49.99]There's going to be like an explosion here.
[149:52.01]He ain't going nowhere.
[149:53.05]Kill them all.
[149:54.01]Kill, kill, kill.
[149:54.87]I do have like a pretty good ending.
[149:56.61]Who are you?
[149:58.01]I know who you are.
[149:58.98]I've met with Dr. Oha.
[150:00.22]He is safe, and he wants me to bring you to him now.
[150:03.24]But I don't even know where I am.
[150:04.42]Look, I don't have time to explain everything right now.
[150:07.36]Trust me.
[150:09.12]Act dehydrated.
[150:10.60]Act dehydrated?
[150:11.20]Excuse me.
[150:12.30]Gentlemen, are you trying to kill this man?
[150:14.54]He is going to die of dehydration.
[150:17.44]Yeah, what?
[150:18.78]He's going to die of thirst.
[150:20.28]Please, do something for him.
[150:21.92]Great acting.
[150:22.58]Aw, hell, deputy.
[150:23.54]Get him a drink.
[150:26.05]Just hand it through.
[150:28.17]Hand a glass of water through the bars.
[150:30.59]Get ready.
[150:31.39]What?
[150:33.95]He has to go in here?
[150:34.91]She just took the gun.
[150:36.73]Oh, okay, so... Should I go straight?
[150:38.35]Should I punch?
[150:39.31]Holy shit, I was really dehydrated.
[150:41.19]I don't know which way to go here.
[150:42.89]I'm gonna say left.
[151:01.67]No, that was straight.
[151:04.31]I went straight.
[151:05.85]That was the right play.
[151:10.21]Take the other gun.
[151:10.91]Give me his gun.
[151:11.55]Why are you leaving the gun?
[151:15.51]Oh, for the love of God.
[151:16.97]Take the gun!
[151:17.65]Shit, dude.
[151:18.01]Okay, that was right.
[151:31.50]That was right straight.
[151:35.18]We made it out.
[151:36.00]Good.
[151:36.80]First try.
[151:39.78]Testosterone surge detected.
[151:42.23]Get in the fucking tank.
[151:46.67]That's not a tank.
[151:49.41]I thought this thing was a tank.
[151:50.51]It's like a fucking old shitty wagon.
[151:55.76]What the fuck?
[151:57.66]Why would I get in this thing?
[152:04.93]I can't even steer it.
[152:09.81]The video quality is so bad I thought this was like a World War 2 tank.
[152:16.06]What do you want me to do?
[152:26.71]We're dead.
[152:27.45]We died.
[152:28.33]Alright, assess the choices.
[152:31.05]Let's get in the Jeep.
[152:35.76]Is that a motorcycle there?
[152:39.24]Yeah, that's a motorcycle.
[152:40.28]That's the next choice.
[152:41.28]If we don't find it, we fuck this up.
[152:45.62]This is the safe play.
[152:47.64]For sure.
[152:48.10]I just hit left.
[153:05.28]I didn't, okay.
[153:06.42]I went straight.
[153:10.66]Where do I go?
[153:17.32]Dude, I couldn't even see what the fuck.
[153:23.30]Prisoner killed while trying to escape.
[153:25.26]That's not true.
[153:26.02]Shit.
[153:27.80]That was very much alive.
[153:34.60]Let's get on the bike.
[153:37.88]We just drove into a little bit of wood.
[153:39.34]Why would that kill us?
[153:40.62]Don't ask me.
[153:41.04]I have no fucking idea.
[153:42.08]Let's take the bike.
[153:48.96]Grab a helmet.
[153:58.98]It's just a guessing game now, and we're gonna get to the beginning of the game.
[154:05.30]I don't know which choices are right.
[154:09.14]Here we go.
[154:12.75]I don't know.
[154:17.65]Straight.
[154:24.49]I use fucking series.
[154:30.73]You know what?
[154:31.33]Let's get back on the wagon.
[154:32.90]I really think the wagon was a good choice.
[154:38.32]Will I play the sequel?
[154:41.50]Is there a sequel to this game?
[154:45.38]You better believe I'll play the sequel.
[154:46.58]There actually is one.
[154:48.80]Take the tank.
[154:55.94]And then, I guess what I'm going to have to do is go right.
[154:59.83]Just don't crash.
[155:02.19]Just dive out or something.
[155:04.49]I can't steer.
[155:15.46]I don't think the wagon is correct, because I went straight and then I went right.
[155:19.88]I don't know what to do here.
[155:22.14]Straight didn't work.
[155:23.98]I didn't pick something.
[155:24.70]She picked the Jeep automatically.
[155:31.20]I didn't have a chance.
[155:32.98]She did it.
[155:36.18]This is her last chance.
[155:42.88]I'm gonna listen to what she says this time.
[155:48.12]First thing I did was straight.
[155:50.12]Okay.
[155:56.19]Okay.
[155:57.71]She told me to go straight!
[156:00.49]She said go straight get your hands right up now You guys told me to listen to her To go straight and I she she got us fucking into the lab we listened to her She said oh great She went go straight
[156:29.59]What are you talking about?
[156:30.21]She didn't say right.
[156:30.77]She said go straight.
[156:36.87]We're doing it again.
[156:37.41]Do you think we're not doing this again?
[156:43.57]Don't trust her.
[156:53.98]At least we can get back there pretty easily.
[157:04.58]This one's easy.
[157:06.45]We can get up there quickly.
[157:08.73]Very quickly.
[157:11.89]Bang.
[157:12.37]And then we fly off into the car.
[157:17.27]Yoink.
[157:19.19]See you later.
[157:20.01]And then straight into the car.
[157:22.61]Hello.
[157:23.40]Skip this scene, please.
[157:25.56]They're trying to kill me.
[157:28.50]That was a 3D movie maker sound effect, by the way.
[157:32.14]Did you guys hear that?
[157:36.90]The whole thing is 40 fucking minutes long.
[157:39.27]I don't even remember the whole Wild West sequence.
[157:47.35]Come on, let me skip it.
[157:50.90]We're going to try the wagon and then left.
[157:56.28]That's what I want to try.
[158:04.99]There we go.
[158:09.21]Save as much battery as we can to make a bunch of mistakes later on.
[158:18.02]Skip.
[158:23.40]You know what I really need to do?
[158:25.90]I gotta write these down.
[158:30.05]I can't jump out of a plane!
[158:31.43]I gotta write every single sequence.
[158:33.71]Because I will forget once we get like fucking 25 minutes into this.
[158:37.21]I'm gonna have to get a pen.
[158:38.19]I'm gonna have to pen and write it down.
[158:54.20]Hey!
[158:55.42]You're good!
[158:58.42]Is my SEGA CD gonna, like, overheat?
[159:00.36]Did that happen?
[159:01.14]Was that a thing back in the day?
[159:12.85]Twitch plays Wiredown.
[159:17.46]Down, and then we're in the Wild West.
[159:20.86]Full battery.
[159:25.63]The frame rate on this is so bad, dude.
[159:27.81]That makes me laugh.
[159:29.53]It's like fucking 16 frames per second.
[159:32.97]Wait, did it kill me?
[159:42.07]Oh, no, no, no.
[159:46.26]Okay.
[159:50.08]Can't skip it.
[159:52.18]Is it weird that I want to make one of these games?
[159:55.62]It can't be that hard.
[159:57.33]You just have to film a bunch of dumb shit.
[160:00.41]You just gotta get a bunch of actors and play out like 90 different scenarios.
[160:04.71]And have people pick them.
[160:09.49]Okay.
[160:09.69]So we'll take a right, then we take a left.
[160:21.20]Howdy.
[160:21.86]Get ourselves arrested.
[160:25.48]Talk to the people on the left.
[160:28.78]They've talked about the hat.
[160:30.36]Punch the guy.
[160:30.98]Punch the guy.
[160:31.54]Howdy.
[160:32.26]Nice hat.
[160:32.92]Thank you.
[160:34.06]Where'd you get it?
[160:35.12]Oh, a store.
[160:36.10]General store.
[160:37.22]Looks awfully familiar to me.
[160:39.24]Can't skip it.
[160:40.42]Sure does.
[160:42.04]Oh, yeah?
[160:42.46]Sure does.
[160:42.84]We're going to throw a variable in.
[160:44.04]We're going to kick, kick.
[160:45.60]M-O-O-S-E.
[160:46.62]Moose.
[160:50.42]That's my hat.
[160:51.64]Here we go.
[160:52.56]You know what we do with hat wrestlers?
[160:54.62]No.
[160:56.34]Kick.
[160:57.64]You can't kick.
[161:02.47]You can't kick.
[161:04.17]I went for like a fucking karate round out.
[161:07.43]And it didn't do anything.
[161:08.43]It still worked apparently.
[161:12.55]No, it actually did not.
[161:14.63]It did not.
[161:15.21]Yes, it did.
[161:16.28]But I lost...
[161:22.65]I lost battery for that.
[161:29.11]Skip this.
[161:31.69]We go right.
[161:35.42]Straight.
[161:36.24]And then we do wagon left.
[161:37.28]I just sit here with a coffee in my hand.
[161:38.90]Like, oh, this is getting tense.
[161:57.24]Wasn't I supposed to do something here?
[162:02.86]What?
[162:03.48]Wait.
[162:03.74]Wait, that wasn't the right way.
[162:06.00]What?
[162:24.85]I'm taking I'm taking like the high road here That was a man of law enforcement I guess we better take her to Sheriff these guys are imposters look at their ID call the FBI check it out Am I gonna get protected here Luckily we were in the neighborhood
[162:49.26]This is going on for a little too long.
[162:52.92]Here we go.
[162:53.74]Okay, the guy on the right just... The guy on the right just stood there.
[163:05.51]He just watched that all happen.
[163:09.57]We're playing out this long cutscene for no reason.
[163:12.55]That was just a very long cutscene.
[163:15.83]So this time...
[163:18.03]This time we're not going to be like, excuse me, this is illegal.
[163:20.83]We're wasting battery.
[163:21.49]That's precious battery.
[163:22.13]So straight, right, straight.
[163:22.95]Straight, right, straight, left, left.
[163:24.95]Got it.
[163:25.25]Okay.
[163:49.16]Get in there.
[163:49.56]This game's too scary, turn around.
[163:56.29]There they are, we have to turn back around, go right, straight.
[164:03.02]That way.
[164:03.50]And then we get out here and we go straight.
[164:16.42]Brings us to the outdoors.
[164:18.18]Wagon.
[164:19.76]Left.
[164:27.27]Here we go.
[164:29.05]Is it just me, or has the video quality gotten worse?
[164:37.22]I feel like the video quality has degraded since we started playing.
[164:41.58]Or am I just losing my mind?
[164:50.30]Oh, they've lost their damn mind.
[164:51.78]Okay, I'm gonna take a left.
[165:00.93]Here we go.
[165:04.09]That worked.
[165:04.87]Now what?
[165:05.45]Holy shit, right.
[165:09.46]Oh boy.
[165:10.06]Okay, so that was right.
[165:13.24]Now what?
[165:15.26]Left?
[165:20.45]We did it.
[165:23.29]Oh my fucking god.
[165:28.29]Ugh.
[165:31.39]Oh, there's so... Oh my god, there's so many options there.
[165:43.18]Okay, so that was... God damn it.
[165:47.78]I don't really...
[165:50.93]Wirehead blames Jerma.
[165:52.29]We're gonna try it again.
[165:57.93]Come on, come on, come on.
[165:59.99]Left.
[166:01.29]Right.
[166:03.49]And then, I don't know, right, I guess?
[166:05.96]Left, right, right?
[166:08.56]That seems like the only possible way.
[166:16.99]Because I went left the other time.
[166:18.91]I'm going to say left, right, right.
[166:28.76]It's left, that's how you get to this point.
[166:30.72]Then it's right.
[166:32.58]That's what I did.
[166:33.12]Left, right.
[166:34.51]And then left.
[166:35.45]No, I'm going to go right.
[166:37.69]I'm going to go right.
[166:41.81]Right.
[166:46.47]That wasn't it.
[166:46.93]That wasn't it.
[166:48.39]What the fuck?
[166:51.11]So it's straight.
[166:51.77]Why would it be straight?
[166:55.26]I'm driving right behind the cruiser.
[166:56.84]Why would it be straight?
[167:01.08]Left.
[167:04.72]That's not what I just did.
[167:05.76]The left was grayed out.
[167:08.65]The only other way was right and straight.
[167:12.84]I didn't do right last time.
[167:14.08]The grayed out one is the one that I did.
[167:16.88]Go look!
[167:18.06]Okay, here we go.
[167:27.20]Left, right, straight.
[167:28.14]Left.
[167:28.44]Right.
[167:43.26]Straight.
[167:45.76]Here we go.
[167:46.26]Straight.
[167:48.82]The only other option.
[167:51.60]Keep going.
[167:54.89]Oh, God.
[167:55.95]I just did straight again.
[167:58.09]And it worked.
[167:59.31]Right?
[168:00.39]It worked.
[168:02.01]Now what do I do?
[168:07.35]Oh, God.
[168:07.95]Okay.
[168:12.77]Jesus Christ.
[168:15.17]Who's this guy?
[168:17.52]New character.
[168:18.92]We're riding on the back of a hayride.
[168:36.44]We went from the Wild West.
[168:37.68]Oh, this is the guy.
[168:42.61]Isn't this the doctor that was on the screen at the very beginning?
[168:49.57]So, has my friend been taking care of you?
[168:52.29]What is going on, doctor?
[168:54.29]Why are these people chasing me?
[168:56.50]They're after you because of the operation.
[168:58.98]What do you mean?
[168:59.60]Well, after the accident, I reconnected your brain with electrodes.
[169:04.40]And now you're quite normal.
[169:06.20]Well, I don't know if I'd say that.
[169:08.20]Okay.
[169:08.44]Great.
[169:09.49]It's normal, except why are these people trying to kill me?
[169:12.69]Oh, they don't care about you.
[169:14.29]They want what's in your brain.
[169:16.39]Brain control.
[169:17.27]It's the dream of every fascist dictator in the world.
[169:19.53]Oh, God, the fucking CIA.
[169:20.55]One of the worst after us.
[169:22.26]Dr. Akabu Slitkan and his thugs.
[169:25.58]Those two feds.
[169:26.38]Fucking goddamn CIA.
[169:29.02]They call her heels because of the stiletto shoes she wears.
[169:31.96]The last thing anyone ever sees.
[169:34.01]Yeah, I saw them.
[169:35.23]Well, that's great.
[169:36.41]What are we going to do?
[169:37.23]Well, the first thing we can do... Guys, the only way we can clear this thing is to get the story to my editor.
[169:42.95]The second this thing hits the front page, you two are safe.
[169:45.36]I agree.
[169:46.08]And you get your story.
[169:47.26]I agree.
[169:47.52]That's a good idea.
[169:47.90]You have a better idea.
[169:48.82]Let's bring it right to the press.
[169:51.06]Oh.
[169:57.18]Who is it?
[169:58.28]Housecleaning.
[169:59.22]It's housekeeping.
[170:00.78]Um, come back later.
[170:02.88]It's really not a good time for us right now.
[170:04.96]Remote control active.
[170:06.14]Sorry, must do housecleaning now.
[170:10.86]What?
[170:13.50]I said it's time for housecleaning.
[170:17.28]It's just a fucking machine gun?
[170:18.50]And now the... Okay, well...
[170:32.19]Look at how many fucking pixels are on the screen.
[170:36.93]Did she just cut the apple in half with her fucking heel?
[170:42.11]Oh my god.
[170:46.97]Oh wow, what a badass.
[170:48.09]Hey, remember when having like big blonde hair and sunglasses meant you were like a henchman?
[170:53.40]I think we lose.
[170:54.18]Yes.
[171:03.71]So, that obviously was incorrect.
[171:06.19]We have to go left.
[171:07.21]Hey, he bit the apple and broke all of its teeth.
[171:17.73]Remember when, like, eating fruit was cool?
[171:20.01]Back in the fuckin' 90s?
[171:21.43]Let's try left.
[171:29.09]Straight.
[171:30.87]Left, straight.
[171:34.63]Okay, we're gonna go left, straight.
[171:37.89]That seems to have worked.
[171:38.73]There's gonna be one more thing here.
[171:50.18]Why take the wig off now?
[171:53.72]This is a wedding ceremony now.
[171:57.36]There's not enough pixels on the screen.
[171:58.86]Are we stealing the fucking wedding getaway mobile?
[172:02.17]Why are we taking the wedding Batmobile?
[172:05.85]Oh, that's incredibly rude.
[172:07.47]It's just like GTA.
[172:10.97]Oh, God.
[172:11.43]No!
[172:12.23]Left, straight.
[172:36.32]I don't like when you have to get into a fucking vehicle.
[172:38.84]When you get into a vehicle, it's just a wild guessing game.
[172:53.93]The vehicle parts of the game are the worst.
[172:55.43]Because you can't even think logically.
[172:58.38]You just have to pick one of three.
[173:00.30]You have a 33% chance to get it right.
[173:04.44]How much money did they spend on this dumb game?
[173:07.00]Not enough.
[173:07.40]Hooray!
[173:21.80]So this time, we're not going to go straight.
[173:24.71]We're going to go left.
[173:27.69]I think.
[173:32.58]Let's take a look.
[173:33.73]Left.
[173:37.57]And then right.
[173:40.03]And then right again.
[173:40.55]I don't know.
[173:40.99]What?
[173:42.23]What the fuck was that?
[173:43.01]It gave me... What?
[173:45.01]What was that choice?
[173:46.52]I pressed right and it was like, oh, you mean... Is that my brain?
[173:59.39]Hey, Slipknot.
[173:59.99]Look, I delivered the merchandise.
[174:01.33]Now payday, huh?
[174:02.94]Alright.
[174:04.16]Bring him in.
[174:10.84]SAT uplink reconnected.
[174:12.23]6200 on your SATs.
[174:17.53]I guess that was like intended, maybe?
[174:24.59]Come on, let's get this thing over with.
[174:29.46]All in good time, my dear.
[174:32.19]I mean, is that the maid?
[174:35.25]That's the maid, right?
[174:38.40]He's gonna get syringed.
[174:40.96]Guaranteed.
[174:42.12]Take your pick.
[174:43.52]Which one of these characters is getting a syringe in the neck?
[174:59.92]Strength boosted by 180%.
[175:01.12]Combat program activated.
[175:03.44]Punch him!
[175:08.39]Please.
[175:09.19]Someone help me.
[175:10.57]No one can help you.
[175:11.57]I pressed kick accidentally.
[175:13.27]Here comes the syringe!
[175:14.23]I told you!
[175:15.09]I fucking told you I was gonna get syringed!
[175:19.83]I fucking knew it!
[175:21.53]I knew it!
[175:24.30]We'll see.
[175:28.06]Good punch.
[175:33.48]Why would you try to kick in that situation?
[175:35.72]What is my plan here?
[175:36.72]I'm gonna punch this guy?
[175:42.00]Oh, I punched that guy's face off.
[175:49.95]I don't fucking know.
[175:53.61]Dude, that guy's skin came off of his face when I punched him.
[176:06.35]Left?
[176:08.61]There's no way to know.
[176:11.79]Punch him.
[176:15.51]They're all holding syringes.
[176:17.51]No, it's a guy with nunchucks.
[176:22.08]Why does that matter?
[176:24.34]Why are head's body found without head?
[176:30.92]They got cut my head off?
[176:45.28]You guys don't think I'm doing it again.
[176:48.08]I'm gonna fucking do it again.
[176:55.05]Let me... Hold on a minute.
[176:56.87]Let me take a piss.
[176:58.03]I'll be right back.
[176:59.74]I'm gonna do it again.
[177:00.44]We have to... We have to at least try it another one or two times.
[177:04.86]I'll be right back.
[177:05.80]Grab a snack.
[177:06.52]I'll be right back.
[179:11.06]okay let's give this a try so do we do we have do we have a uh we have all this like written down like ready to go wirehead 4k remaster alright so should I just like get it I get like a uh because I don't want to mess it up I want to get like back to where we were
[179:41.23]It's left.
[179:41.69]Then it's right.
[179:51.41]Up, up, down, down.
[179:57.55]Let's just get there.
[180:01.65]Skateboard.
[180:03.09]Whoa, holy shit.
[180:04.33]Okay, my button just almost didn't work.
[180:12.06]Turn left.
[180:13.78]Bang a right.
[180:14.50]Get in the car.
[180:17.52]Fly in there.
[180:21.58]And then... Keep driving, please.
[180:26.77]They're trying to kill me.
[180:27.91]I literally just typed the Konami code.
[180:36.01]Where are you going?
[180:36.81]I don't know.
[180:39.45]I guess not a town.
[180:41.35]We'll give this one last try here.
[180:45.93]And then I'm probably going to call it to that.
[180:49.61]I need to get some food.
[180:58.26]We'll go for like another 20 or 30 minutes or so.
[181:00.42]I want to go for at least like three and a half hours.
[181:04.90]Just pull up one of the walkthroughs.
[181:09.26]Cheat.
[181:11.58]I have to complete the game.
[181:14.72]Alright, well, how about this?
[181:15.88]I promise you this.
[181:16.58]We will complete this game tonight.
[181:19.44]Okay?
[181:26.80]We will get to the end, even if we have to pull up like a fucking walkthrough.
[181:35.95]Okay, skip it.
[181:40.80]This game's way too good to, like, not have closure on, right?
[181:49.73]Alright, I have... I have a walkthrough here pulled up to get us back to where, like, to get us to, like, back to where we were.
[182:10.15]So, there ain't gonna be any mistakes up until we get to that point, then.
[182:12.53]No walkthrough.
[182:15.05]Well, maybe I will.
[182:16.01]I don't know.
[182:16.81]Let's see.
[182:17.19]Made it back in time for the... Whoa.
[182:31.24]Yes, you did.
[182:32.44]Mm-hmm.
[182:33.20]Take a right.
[182:33.76]Watch out for the fucking bear.
[182:44.08]This is down.
[182:47.14]Mm-hmm.
[182:54.45]Didn't this guy have a wife and kids?
[182:55.85]Yeah, there was, like, a house full of people, from my understanding.
[182:58.47]Yeah, the bear, like, checks your wallet.
[183:04.49]He, like, grabs your shit.
[183:05.49]Mm-hmm.
[183:11.49]Alright.
[183:22.34]Maybe making him do flips.
[183:23.42]Yeah, the very big, the little kids with the, uh... That brings us here.
[183:37.21]Oh, fuck.
[183:40.12]It's okay.
[183:40.60]I'm over at the pig.
[183:41.72]We have to ride the pig.
[183:49.92]What the fuck?! !
[183:53.01]It's like, that was terrible.
[183:57.08]Looks like we got him, deputy.
[183:59.18]Why would I even get on the pig?
[184:01.56]He just looked at me so angrily.
[184:06.94]We skipped the whole bar fight.
[184:09.35]I ride a pig.
[184:15.45]That's so stupid.
[184:16.73]Alright, let's go.
[184:24.59]Open the cell.
[184:30.28]Let's follow the walkthrough and see what it tells me to do.
[184:32.36]The walkthrough tells me to go right here.
[184:33.82]Should I listen to the walkthrough or should I do what we did before and go straight?
[184:45.04]Walkthrough.
[184:49.93]Oh, the walkthrough is the same as the regular one.
[184:54.53]The walkthrough is what we already do.
[184:58.33]Okay.
[185:00.57]No cheating.
[185:01.07]Only cheating to get to the point that we got to before.
[185:04.48]So I don't make any dumb mistakes.
[185:06.72]And accidentally get us killed.
[185:12.00]I remember this part.
[185:17.85]Get to the fucking tank.
[185:25.95]Testosterone surge detected.
[185:27.47]Get in the tank.
[185:28.07]Alright, let's do it.
[185:30.31]There we go.
[185:32.65]This is left.
[185:33.51]If I remember, it's left, right, straight, straight.
[185:58.20]The testosterone surge.
[186:04.06]Left.
[186:05.52]Right.
[186:07.70]Straight.
[186:08.50]Straight.
[186:11.94]Yep, I remember this.
[186:20.02]Straight.
[186:21.94]Okey-dokey.
[186:23.20]And we should be back at the maid, right?
[186:33.05]Oh, goddammit, they got away again.
[186:34.71]Okay, here's this guy that we ride on the back.
[186:41.18]Okay.
[186:46.80]Can we skip it?
[186:48.04]No.
[186:51.07]Just jump off when you get to the nunchuck bridge.
[186:56.69]Is this the worst FMV game ever?
[186:59.97]No.
[187:01.74]Alright, so it's... It was left, right?
[187:05.46]Left, straight.
[187:10.02]This is like the best FMV game ever, I would say.
[187:14.25]Alright, so now we are where we were before, pretty much.
[187:19.29]Almost.
[187:22.91]Left, straight.
[187:29.93]And then what?
[187:30.65]I think left again, right?
[187:36.71]Everything moves so fast.
[187:37.71]Well, we've been, if you're just joining us, this is like the seventh or eighth time we've gone through this part of the game.
[187:43.95]We've at least got to like... We've tried this game like 10 to 12 different times.
[187:48.38]Okay, this is the... I don't know what happens here.
[187:53.96]I think you just fail.
[187:55.98]I think you just fail here.
[187:58.24]And then you get syringed.
[188:04.66]I remember it was left, right, left.
[188:07.10]That's all I know.
[188:11.02]Left.
[188:14.04]Right.
[188:17.00]And then left.
[188:20.62]Now what?
[188:22.34]Wait, that wasn't what happened before.
[188:28.99]Straight.
[188:31.33]Of course not.
[188:33.45]Nope, we drove into this fucking car that's parked.
[188:36.53]It's me, the guy that, we're just in every... Okay, that shit didn't happen before.
[188:45.50]Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[188:54.30]So, okay, we have not been here, we've been here before.
[188:59.37]Here comes the scene, here comes the punch.
[189:01.61]Punch him in the face.
[189:06.06]Wait, hold on a minute.
[189:06.72]Didn't he just unload the gun on us?
[189:12.18]They just both shot us with, like, a full clip of fucking ammo.
[189:17.49]We don't have any bullet wounds or anything.
[189:18.73]How are we alive?
[189:21.59]Fuck out of my face!
[189:26.65]Okay, left.
[189:28.99]No, no, which way?
[189:29.43]Let's go right.
[189:34.11]And then the guy with the nunchucks, we're gonna go left.
[189:42.81]They were stormtroopers.
[189:44.75]Okay, here we go.
[189:48.69]Jump off.
[189:49.07]What are you doing?
[189:52.95]What the fuck are you doing?
[189:53.97]I told them to go the other way.
[189:55.45]Oh my god.
[189:56.49]Look at me.
[189:56.83]Look at my nunchucks.
[190:05.92]Bad connections for Wirehead.
[190:07.76]Okay.
[190:10.88]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[190:15.07]Punch.
[190:15.69]Right.
[190:16.67]I did go right.
[190:21.71]You can see that actor smiling.
[190:25.46]So I hit right there, and that didn't do anything.
[190:39.37]So I hit right, and then I think it's straight.
[190:45.54]Because I hit right, and watch, it's gonna be grayed out, you'll see.
[190:47.64]Twitch still thinks I'm on.
[190:53.93]See, ready, watch this.
[190:54.85]I hit right this time.
[190:56.33]We need to go straight.
[191:01.17]I did right last time.
[191:02.45]What the fuck?!
[191:06.10]So it's left on the walkway.
[191:10.32]I thought it was gonna be straight, like straight over the railing, not like turn left and then straight.
[191:18.13]We'll see.
[191:21.64]Get the fuck out of here.
[191:27.16]Put him on the table.
[191:28.62]The nunchuck guy is great.
[191:29.80]Yeah, he is.
[191:30.44]Get onto him.
[191:32.79]How many times are we going to punch this guy?
[191:36.23]I don't know.
[191:38.29]So it's left on the walkway.
[191:40.35]How do we get out of here?
[191:45.48]Maybe you can't go on the elevator.
[191:46.56]I'm assuming there has to be a way out of every situation, right?
[191:58.62]Here we go.
[191:59.06]Left.
[192:07.44]You can't avoid the nunchuck guy.
[192:10.56]We've tried left, we've tried right, we've tried straight.
[192:13.08]You just can't go in the elevator.
[192:15.18]Okay.
[192:16.29]Good to know.
[192:19.95]We'll see.
[192:25.69]I actually did press right.
[192:27.31]Right doesn't do it either.
[192:28.59]I did right last time.
[192:30.87]Last time we got in that situation, it was right.
[192:33.84]So we're just not going to go in the elevator.
[192:40.09]Is the stairs straight or is the stairs left?
[192:42.43]How do we get out of here?
[192:47.32]Up the stairs.
[192:47.94]There we go, up the stairs.
[192:51.46]Okay.
[192:52.14]No, not up the stairs.
[192:54.78]All you fucking assholes that told me to go up the goddamn stairs, we walked right into the fucking crazy lady.
[193:04.21]This is really awkward.
[193:08.68]This is really awkward.
[193:11.81]You couldn't just fucking walk around her?
[193:22.49]You get back in your room, mister.
[193:28.49]We'll see.
[193:29.49]Let's try straight.
[193:37.86]Just go right.
[193:39.12]Guys, I did that last time.
[193:43.08]I fucking did that last time.
[193:46.18]I already did that shit.
[193:54.19]This way.
[193:59.96]What the fuck?
[194:00.90]Didn't I punch this guy?
[194:04.67]Honest to God, I went right last time.
[194:06.71]Every option doesn't work.
[194:08.71]No options work.
[194:15.33]We'll see.
[194:19.73]Alright, last time I did this, I went right.
[194:23.33]I went right after the elevator and nothing happened.
[194:26.39]It didn't work.
[194:33.39]I swear to God.
[194:34.09]Alright, we're gonna go, we're gonna get in the elevator and then we're gonna go right.
[194:42.80]Get in the fucking elevator.
[194:49.76]Up the stairs, no.
[194:50.78]Here we go, right.
[194:56.97]Right.
[194:59.38]That didn't work.
[194:59.94]That didn't happen last time.
[195:01.88]Go back in the VOD and you tell me what button I tried to press in the last playthrough.
[195:11.11]It was right.
[195:13.03]It must have just fucking mashed up.
[195:15.51]And we're dead again.
[195:23.10]Alright, hold on.
[195:24.28]Pause the game.
[195:28.37]Alright, give me a break.
[195:29.31]The fucking SEGA Genesis controller is on like a giant axis.
[195:33.60]If you press right, sometimes it just presses up.
[195:42.98]Which way am I going here?
[195:55.40]Bad controller.
[195:56.30]Bad controller.
[196:04.34]Alright, I'm seeing a lot of lefts here.
[196:05.80]Okay.
[196:12.29]Now what?
[196:13.61]Now which way?
[196:15.63]This is Twitch Plays.
[196:18.27]Twitch Plays Wirehead.
[196:26.10]It must not have registered when I pressed it.
[196:55.10]Okay.
[196:56.38]Alright, you guys ready?
[196:57.32]You guys ready for the walkthrough?
[196:59.42]It's time.
[197:03.48]We're doing the full walkthrough of the game.
[197:06.67]There it is.
[197:07.17]There's the walkthrough.
[197:09.71]We're doing it.
[197:14.09]Here comes the full walkthrough of the game.
[197:23.03]Here you go.
[197:24.43]Twitch plays.
[197:25.25]It's not Twitch plays.
[197:26.27]It's here comes the fucking walkthrough.
[197:36.11]Look, we've tried this like fucking 12 times.
[197:38.39]Come on.
[197:39.81]Oh shit.
[197:40.31]Okay, I gotta pay attention.
[197:46.03]Skateboard.
[197:46.65]I don't need the walkthrough right now.
[197:54.67]I'm gonna get lost with all the directions.
[197:56.35]I really might.
[198:02.08]Look, how about this?
[198:02.78]I won't use the walkthrough when we get to situations that aren't, like, left, right, left, left, straight, left, right.
[198:09.12]When we get, like, actual choices.
[198:11.08]Once we get actual choices, I just deleted the whole walkthrough.
[198:16.08]Fuck!
[198:17.36]Where am I?
[198:18.49]Right here.
[198:21.41]I don't know.
[198:23.23]Okay, we're good.
[198:33.29]I'm using the walkthrough right now.
[198:40.88]Walkthrough out smart streamer because he hits the backspace key.
[198:49.94]This game is fucking fantastic, by the way.
[198:53.72]I do wish... I do wish that I could have, like, a save point.
[199:03.51]If I was allowed a save point... Where I could just come back to, like... A major checkpoint or something.
[199:10.15]It'd be much more interesting.
[199:12.57]Otherwise I wouldn't have to memorize the entire video game's sequences of buttons.
[199:19.78]What are you doing?
[199:25.45]You save states?
[199:27.27]Uh... Hey, my man.
[199:30.55]I'm on a SEGA CD in real life.
[199:34.13]This ain't an emulator.
[199:35.32]This is the real deal sitting on my fucking floor over here.
[199:39.34]There's a real CD in here.
[199:40.60]This is authentic.
[199:55.27]No save states in the authentic... I had to be quiet for that.
[200:05.11]That's gonna be burned in everybody's brain.
[200:06.48]You guys are gonna have fucking dreams of that noise.
[200:08.90]I know I will.
[200:14.46]We gotta see what happens at the end.
[200:15.62]It's important.
[200:19.91]Real game fake victory.
[200:22.60]And you guys had fucking wanted me to do save states?
[200:24.68]That's not a real victory either.
[200:27.80]Using save states is like the same thing.
[200:31.84]It's still cheating.
[200:36.27]If I were to save scum right now, that's cheating.
[200:46.70]Make that a subse- Oh, that would get old real quick.
[200:54.43]Hey, you're good, might be a good subsound.
[200:56.98]With the laugh.
[200:58.70]That could be good.
[200:59.18]It's okay, it's not like I haven't had the same subsounds and resubsounds for like fucking a year and a half.
[201:06.62]Dude, my resubsound is a Hearthstone card.
[201:12.11]And I've never even streamed Hearthstone.
[201:15.93]I've never played that game on stream.
[201:17.81]Maybe one time for 12 minutes.
[201:25.45]It's a fucking Hearthstone card.
[201:28.93]Alright, get on pig.
[201:36.44]I have played Hearthstone one time.
[201:39.68]At least once.
[201:47.75]Bring back Orson Welles.
[201:48.77]Orson Welles is like too long though.
[201:57.02]Alright, here we go.
[201:58.32]Let's get up there.
[201:59.20]Let's at least escape the power plant.
[202:01.12]Oh, for a second I thought I fucked up.
[202:02.66]Why do I lose battery for that if you have to do it?
[202:04.34]That seems like bullshit.
[202:12.19]Here we go.
[202:14.35]Bring back Paul Barrett.
[202:15.31]You guys, those of you there that used to watch the stream from like a couple years ago, or like a year and a half ago or so now.
[202:20.19]No, actually that was like not even that.
[202:21.75]It was like just about a year.
[202:24.01]My original subscriber sound was like 17 seconds long.
[202:29.71]It was Paul Bearer doing a speech in the ring.
[202:32.83]It was abysmal.
[202:33.87]It like ruined streams.
[202:38.69]It was like somebody would subscribe and like a 30 second sound clip would play.
[202:43.63]It was too much.
[202:52.35]It was the best.
[202:53.09]It was.
[202:53.51]I loved every second of it.
[203:00.44]I wish I could bring it back, but I just... A long time ago, I tried to find another Paul Bearer sound clip.
[203:08.63]And there was a few, but it was just hard to put them together and piece them together and splice the audio and make it work and have it not sound terrible.
[203:15.33]Because a lot of the old Paul Bearer sound files are old and shit and they sound terrible coming through, like a microphone echoing and people cheering.
[203:25.11]Alright, here we go.
[203:32.73]Left.
[203:33.66]Left it is.
[203:42.60]Listen to yourself.
[203:46.14]I'm your dad.
[203:49.30]Well, not even that one.
[203:50.40]It was before that.
[203:51.18]Remember, it was... How do I play?
[204:03.22]What is it?
[204:06.20]Up?
[204:06.36]Okay.
[204:06.66]I decided I had a fucking minor freakout right there.
[204:14.78]I could have done that whole thing.
[204:19.82]I just forgot how to play the game though.
[204:28.73]Oh my goodness!
[204:30.17]Did you hear that?
[204:33.83]I would have just screamed it, but... Sorry guys, the whole impression didn't get there.
[204:41.53]That was actually good.
[204:45.83]How long have you been trying to beat this game?
[204:48.59]At this point, it's been like an hour and a half.
[204:52.30]I've been enjoying every second of it, though.
[204:54.00]This game is great.
[204:55.36]Okay, let's keep going.
[204:58.34]Let's see the machine gun maid.
[205:08.47]Guys, there are still games to play.
[205:11.79]I have, like, at least seven or eight more SEGA CD games to play.
[205:15.62]Fuck, left?
[205:16.20]Okay.
[205:21.85]This is not it.
[205:22.61]SEGA CD won't make a return.
[205:24.59]We may even do it tomorrow.
[205:37.23]There is more.
[205:38.83]This one was just the most important one.
[205:40.43]For sure.
[205:40.67]This is the one I wanted to spend the most time on.
[205:42.51]Because this one looked like the most fun.
[205:44.66]And it turned out it kind of was the most fun.
[205:47.32]The other ones had their moments.
[205:49.56]What was it?
[205:50.36]Super Scope?
[205:50.90]What was the name of that fucking dumb game?
[205:53.10]Tactical Strike?
[205:57.62]It was awful.
[205:58.80]But that was hysterical.
[206:05.31]Alright, we're gonna go left.
[206:06.13]I remember it's left, right, left, right.
[206:13.01]Dude, how would you ever get this the first try?
[206:20.14]And then left, left.
[206:23.42]Left.
[206:23.76]We're going very fast.
[206:27.96]Left.
[206:33.56]Look at this massive guessing game.
[206:36.00]How would you ever do this without a walkthrough?
[206:41.24]Are you fucking shitting me?
[206:45.50]There's no way you could ever get this.
[206:48.38]It's so much guessing.
[206:58.48]Okay, explosion.
[207:02.32]Look at those cars, they don't even have any damage done to them.
[207:08.49]Vehicle halted.
[207:10.73]Blood pressure normalized.
[207:11.83]Alright, let's try it from here.
[207:13.39]Oh fuck.
[207:31.79]Hold on, what?
[207:34.09]Oh, I forgot about this joke.
[207:36.89]Shit.
[207:38.27]I forgot to play this joke.
[207:40.25]Oh, goddammit.
[207:42.38]This is what happens when you don't fucking remember things.
[207:46.59]I was going to play this like while I was playing Night Trap.
[207:48.85]I blew it.
[207:50.55]I blew it.
[207:50.99]That's too bad.
[207:51.87]This is like they held like a fucking Congress meeting about how Night Trap was the worst video game ever made.
[207:58.23]Damn it.
[207:58.47]That's too bad.
[208:11.16]They go over how, like, the Night Trap is gonna, like, ruin the world and stuff like that.
[208:14.80]That's fucking... God damn it.
[208:18.86]I blew it.
[208:19.32]It's okay.
[208:21.38]Whatever.
[208:24.28]I blew that one.
[208:37.97]Oh, shit.
[208:38.51]I'm trying to, like, get rid of it.
[208:42.98]I can't even, hold on.
[208:43.86]I like fucking, it won't like stop playing in the background.
[208:46.84]Oh no, there it goes.
[208:49.54]Well, whatever, it's gone.
[208:50.26]Hey, remember how funny that was?
[208:53.26]That was a pretty good joke.
[208:54.80]Look, Han's got your family.
[208:57.27]What?
[208:58.53]He's taken your family hostage and he wants Dr. Ohan in exchange for them.
[209:03.67]I'm so sad that I didn't get to play that.
[209:04.97]You guys would have thought that was really funny.
[209:07.51]Ow!
[209:07.75]I'll give them what they want.
[209:09.79]They don't need you.
[209:11.95]Are you crazy?
[209:13.46]And your entire family.
[209:14.42]Every stream I know it's gonna happen, every stream.
[209:37.84]This guy's acting is perfect.
[209:38.90]Alright.
[209:39.66]Now we're on to the apex of the game.
[209:41.64]This is the last half of the game.
[209:43.00]We have to sneak onto the boat and we have to shoot the bad guy or something.
[209:46.60]In our just married mobile.
[210:08.14]Skip the laboratory.
[210:09.60]We, like, got our asses kicked in the laboratory, like, three times.
[210:22.47]Jesus, man.
[210:23.16]Like, this is... You know when Slenderman gets really close to you?
[210:27.00]And your screen gets all fucked up?
[210:29.54]Oh, hold on.
[210:30.00]Offline.
[210:31.80]Updating sat link location.
[210:36.05]Back online.
[210:44.75]Downstairs.
[210:47.23]No?
[210:47.57]Okay, that... That wasn't correct.
[210:56.32]I guess that wasn't correct.
[211:00.20]It was.
[211:01.36]What?
[211:08.33]The walkthrough is not correct.
[211:11.52]The walkthrough is not correct.
[211:15.82]Oh, no.
[211:20.52]The walkthrough isn't right.
[211:25.29]Shit.
[211:31.51]I'm on my own now.
[211:37.31]That little rat's starting to get to me.
[211:39.32]When I get my hands on that little freak, I'm personally gonna rip his eyes out.
[211:42.83]I'm gonna take that, boy!
[211:46.03]Hey, you watch me!
[211:47.29]What?
[211:49.41]That's what I get for cheating.
[211:50.21]You know, you're right.
[211:52.51]Let's see if the walkthrough is still incorrect.
[212:09.00]Yeah, no shit.
[212:12.08]It's a lot of rights so far.
[212:15.31]I might just be getting lucky.
[212:25.05]I think it's correct again.
[212:32.86]What?
[212:35.22]Hello?
[212:35.68]What?
[212:36.02]No.
[212:38.42]This isn't a choice.
[212:39.16]This is not a right.
[212:39.98]This is not a choice I'm getting.
[212:43.72]Whoa!
[212:43.94]That was too quick!
[212:47.32]I blew it.
[212:48.06]No, I didn't.
[212:48.66]Fuck.
[212:49.02]I went off script.
[212:52.04]Shit!
[213:02.46]God damn it.
[213:03.30]Now I don't know where I am because I deleted the rest of it.
[213:07.18]Oh, god damn it.
[213:11.06]My family died, by the way.
[213:12.34]Oh, god damn it.
[213:15.53]I don't know.
[213:16.47]Please be careful.
[213:22.93]Fuck.
[213:26.77]Shit in my pants, dude.
[213:32.18]I think I got it here.
[213:35.40]Just follow the walkthrough.
[213:37.72]They're in there.
[213:38.40]Yep, this will be good.
[213:39.48]I got it.
[213:41.91]Oh, what?
[213:42.59]What?
[213:49.95]Nice work.
[213:51.41]Holy shit, that was perfect.
[213:52.41]Good.
[213:55.13]And then this is right?
[213:57.25]Oh my god, I failed, but it's okay.
[214:00.73]That little rat's starting to get to me.
[214:02.73]When I get my hands on that little freak, I'm personally gonna rip his... That was the worst henchman in the whole place.
[214:06.92]Thank god they had the fucking rookie come after me.
[214:09.24]Hey, you watch me!
[214:11.51]Thank God the fucking rookie came here.
[214:19.74]Right.
[214:22.72]Right, right, right.
[214:24.58]It's three rights in a row.
[214:26.82]Hey, three wrongs don't make a right.
[214:28.20]You know what I'm saying?
[214:31.27]Hey, you know what I'm saying?
[214:32.29]Three lefts don't make a right.
[214:33.29]You know what I'm saying?
[214:33.83]Three wrongs don't make a left.
[214:35.77]You're good.
[214:47.94]Okay, now this is where it fucked up and it messed me up.
[214:59.24]I'm gonna toss this guy overboard.
[215:01.96]No, I'm not.
[215:04.80]Come on.
[215:05.65]I think the CD is scratched up at the end of the game.
[215:10.63]We just have to get this guy just, like, peeping on us now.
[215:13.91]It's left whenever I get control again.
[215:17.15]Got it.
[215:20.48]Holy shit.
[215:24.49]We have to finish this game.
[215:30.53]The CD is... To be fair, I have been playing the SEGA CD for like fucking four hours.
[215:36.96]I don't think it was ever designed to do this.
[215:40.87]You were supposed to play this game for 20 minutes and give up and never play it again.
[215:50.97]Let's write one more time.
[215:52.05]We're getting close.
[215:58.67]I heard something.
[216:15.77]The amount of trial and error here.
[216:19.13]It's left again.
[216:23.12]There are so many guards everywhere.
[216:29.28]I can't wait to see how the end is.
[216:30.56]This is gonna be so funny.
[216:36.35]There's the lady that's always in a different costume.
[216:46.67]I forgot it!
[216:47.05]Okay, I got it.
[216:49.53]Just walking around corridors.
[216:50.77]There's no action.
[216:51.79]I'm so glad I'm using the walkthrough for this.
[216:59.89]Oh, that's my family.
[217:05.34]I'm gonna go in there.
[217:07.90]I'm gonna ruin the whole playthrough.
[217:09.28]And I deleted the fucking walkthrough.
[217:10.44]I have to go in there.
[217:15.10]I gotta go in there.
[217:19.23]We have to go in there.
[217:20.31]Okay, if I can get them in here, do you think we can take them out?
[217:22.63]Fuck.
[217:24.07]Yeah, I think so.
[217:25.79]Feed you to the fish is not that intimidating.
[217:33.29]She's going to... Oh, no, there's an intruder, but she took her clothes off, so I like this now.
[217:39.03]Hey, you over there.
[217:40.75]How dare you break into... Hey, look at her.
[217:43.91]Yeah, she's an intruder and...
[217:49.12]Shit.
[217:49.22]Dude, I got hit in the fucking head with like a brick.
[217:58.74]Oh my god.
[218:00.58]What did he hit him with?
[218:21.31]Did I hit her with a shoe?
[218:32.68]Holy fuck, that was not scary.
[218:38.68]What the fuck is going on?
[218:39.92]Are we really that scared?
[218:44.85]She just like jump scared us and it took us like five seconds to get jump scared.
[218:52.74]She did like a boom.
[219:02.35]Dude, hold on, hold on.
[219:04.45]The fucking hardest enemies in the game, a little child, stepped on his foot and the other guy fell off.
[219:13.11]We're stuck to OHA and the police.
[219:14.79]We can't wait for them right now.
[219:16.23]We gotta get out of here.
[219:17.21]Slick-Hunt's gonna get us.
[219:19.43]My brain is fried.
[219:20.33]I can't even fucking do anything about that.
[219:21.87]Don't you understand?
[219:22.89]He's after you, not your family.
[219:25.39]Those guys were so hard to get rid of and they were everywhere.
[219:27.81]A fucking child stepped on his foot and he did like a Tom and Jerry ow my toe.
[219:32.42]Smashed his face into the wall and the other guy just fell off the fucking cliff.
[219:42.84]That was perfect.
[219:48.93]How is this game still going?
[219:55.41]Blood pressure normalized.
[219:56.61]Assessing the... Oh, God.
[220:01.79]I didn't listen to the... I didn't listen.
[220:07.25]We gotta see these options, man.
[220:08.47]Come on.
[220:09.43]Once... Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
[220:12.03]Once it became very... This girl's back.
[220:17.77]Punch her in the face.
[220:19.03]Punch her right in the face.
[220:20.03]Oh, fuck.
[220:22.90]That's annoying.
[220:25.05]Alright, we have it here.
[220:27.81]We've got our spot.
[220:29.27]Our checkpoint.
[220:32.17]Once it gets to the last fucking life, we'll finish the game.
[220:35.24]But let's try to fucking go through this and do some options here.
[220:42.42]Man, I love how somebody asking us if we're going fishing.
[220:45.00]So straight and right both don't work.
[220:48.61]The same thing happens.
[220:49.27]Going fishing?
[220:52.02]Okay, so you can't go straight, you can't go right.
[220:53.70]It's the exact same thing I did.
[220:55.74]I pressed right and I pressed straight.
[220:57.70]It's the same thing.
[221:01.12]Do we have to go left?
[221:03.86]So what?
[221:04.66]I didn't press straight last time.
[221:06.34]How does that make any sense?
[221:07.50]I did.
[221:09.72]It's the controller.
[221:11.18]It's something to do with the fucking controller.
[221:15.51]Oh god, now we're gonna do bumper cars with this fucking guy.
[221:21.12]What the hell were you trying to do there?
[221:24.58]Was there any point of that?
[221:33.12]Marina crash.
[221:34.36]No survivors.
[221:36.77]But that's not what happened.
[221:39.79]A guy tackled me into the water and apparently every single fucking person died.
[221:49.11]What?
[221:52.44]Wait a minute.
[221:54.00]I don't have this part of the walkthrough saved.
[222:01.57]I'm gonna just mimic everything.
[222:07.62]What?
[222:09.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[222:10.76]Hold on.
[222:11.06]Hold on a second.
[222:11.60]Hold on a second.
[222:12.24]What?
[222:12.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[222:13.18]Wait a second.
[222:13.74]Wait a second.
[222:15.68]Wait a second.
[222:24.44]Uh... It's straight.
[222:31.34]Oh, God.
[222:32.68]Please be careful.
[222:34.12]Why are we back here?
[222:37.42]Why the fuck are we... Why are we back here?
[222:41.90]The last checkpoint was right there.
[222:46.06]Oh, no.
[222:47.89]Hold on.
[222:48.15]Wait, wait, wait.
[222:48.77]I can get it back.
[222:49.25]I can get it back.
[222:50.97]I gotta get to the first... Right, right, right.
[222:52.41]And I'll get it.
[222:58.92]Shit.
[222:59.16]It's okay.
[222:59.96]It's okay.
[223:00.36]She punches this guy in the nuts.
[223:01.20]It's okay.
[223:01.80]Here we go.
[223:05.86]No fucking around this time.
[223:07.34]This is where it is.
[223:08.06]Right, right, right.
[223:09.20]I'll get it.
[223:11.93]The first right, right, right.
[223:18.43]There's up, up.
[223:21.27]There's left, left, right, right, right, right, right.
[223:23.87]Okay.
[223:24.31]Left, left, left, right.
[223:29.64]Hold on, I'll get it.
[223:30.38]Here it is.
[223:31.46]We're good.
[223:32.56]Everybody calm down.
[223:34.82]Everything's under control.
[223:38.69]Right, right, right.
[223:39.73]There it is.
[223:41.33]We got it.
[223:42.39]Saved.
[223:43.79]Everybody chill out.
[223:50.39]That little rat's starting to get to me.
[223:52.39]When I get my hands on that little freak, I'm personally going to rip his eyes out.
[223:55.90]I'm going to take that, boy!
[223:58.63]Well, using the walkthrough as just cheating, if I have lives to use, why not try to see some of the options?
[224:06.57]You want me to just skip the whole entire fucking game?
[224:10.57]Even if I have lives to lose to try?
[224:12.84]Like, come on, that's no fun.
[224:16.82]Be careful.
[224:20.46]They're all over the place.
[224:22.16]That was too close.
[224:24.08]Alright, this way.
[224:27.45]We got it, don't worry.
[224:30.54]Follow me.
[224:34.74]We go left, and then it's another right, right, right.
[224:36.82]Wait a minute.
[224:37.44]No, no, wait.
[224:38.18]Wasn't one of these wrong?
[224:40.64]Oh, fuck.
[224:41.06]I think one of these cutscenes was wrong, wasn't it?
[224:44.66]I don't remember which part of it.
[224:51.01]One of these, the actual walkthrough is incorrect.
[224:55.71]I don't remember which part it is.
[225:05.79]I think we're good.
[225:14.53]Right again.
[225:17.17]Right again.
[225:17.67]And then two lefts.
[225:29.06]Let's hope that... Please, controller, don't fuck up.
[225:32.86]Don't, like, hit up accidentally.
[225:39.02]Left.
[225:41.02]Left.
[225:44.78]It really is just a guessing game, holy shit.
[225:51.72]Okay, there's that lady.
[225:57.49]Left.
[225:58.01]Then we go right.
[226:04.55]And then we're good.
[226:07.71]Right.
[226:10.57]Left.
[226:19.27]And it's left again.
[226:19.97]No, we're good.
[226:21.89]This is the end.
[226:22.35]We get to see the end.
[226:24.61]We get to see... Okay, what items did he actually hit him in the face with?
[226:28.09]Here we go.
[226:32.28]Oh, well, I just skipped it.
[226:33.28]So, never mind.
[226:34.02]Apparently...
[226:36.81]I skipped it.
[226:38.67]Sorry.
[226:39.85]Left.
[226:40.33]We're just beating the game.
[226:47.41]Here we go.
[226:48.07]Right.
[226:51.03]Double left.
[227:01.00]Left.
[227:01.50]So that's right, left, left.
[227:02.74]So left again.
[227:10.20]Easy.
[227:11.48]What?
[227:12.14]Wait, what happened?
[227:13.64]What happened?
[227:13.96]Is she dead?
[227:18.49]I could go over that jump and be fine.
[227:21.77]I could go over that and be okay.
[227:23.59]That was just a shitty little kid's jump.
[227:26.15]I think we can get a taxi over here.
[227:28.99]We're obviously going to take this thing.
[227:30.43]Oh, Ned, come on.
[227:31.71]Not again.
[227:33.45]Come on.
[227:34.67]We've got three rights in a row here.
[227:36.29]I must be crazy.
[227:41.85]Of course the buggy is the correct option, why wouldn't it be?
[227:45.27]We've got three rights in a row.
[227:50.15]The end of the game is in our sights right now.
[227:59.63]That was the worst part of the whole game.
[228:07.53]Imagine getting this far and fucking up because you have to trial and error figure out where the fuck to go.
[228:13.74]And have to start the whole game over and not have to cheat code left, right, left.
[228:16.86]You know what I'm saying?
[228:26.07]Almost there.
[228:28.87]Explosion, right?
[228:29.75]No.
[228:30.27]Those cars don't explode.
[228:31.51]Only the ones before do.
[228:37.44]Left, right.
[228:37.88]Up.
[228:38.02]We're almost there.
[228:38.64]Left.
[228:39.14]Left.
[228:39.50]Right up.
[229:09.21]We win.
[229:11.29]Drove over the cop car.
[229:13.48]Now we get to... Here's the final boss fight.
[229:16.84]Apparently I have... Apparently the button combinations... I don't want to fucking spoil anything.
[229:21.70]But we win.
[229:22.22]We beat the game.
[229:25.10]Legit time to win.
[229:27.40]Apparently we're going to the New York Times.
[229:38.78]The times.
[229:42.40]That's all the button combinations.
[229:43.98]I win.
[229:45.93]Not so fast.
[229:49.25]I believe we have some unfinished business to attend to.
[229:51.89]Oh, no.
[229:52.69]Not you.
[229:53.21]The game is over, Slitcon.
[229:57.71]Give it up.
[229:58.31]Slitcon?
[230:00.71]That sounds like a shitty, like, 1950s convention.
[230:09.27]Alright, so you've got a gun.
[230:12.45]The game is never over, my dear.
[230:14.81]Would you like to come with me or shall we finish things right here?
[230:18.41]Put your hands up.
[230:18.99]To answer your question, Dr. Sleet Khan, I think we should end everything right now.
[230:24.20]Game over, we win.
[230:24.88]All of your evil-minded schemes.
[230:30.48]I didn't do that.
[230:31.40]I didn't press that button.
[230:32.65]That was for me.
[230:34.19]Sally?

[231:06.95]The chief of police has called me.
[231:09.15]You have given me more trouble in one day than I've had in 40 years at this paper.
[231:14.78]Sam, you don't understand.
[231:16.98]This is Dr. Oha.
[231:19.06]And this is Ned Hubbard.

[231:48.64]Oh no, not the kids!
[231:49.66]Okay, don't fuck it up this time.
[231:58.92]I gotta see her fucking kill that guard.
[232:02.10]She Vulcan Death Crips that guard.
[232:03.72]She grabs him on the shoulder and there's a crunching noise.
[232:06.68]She didn't do shit.
[232:07.60]She didn't break his neck.
[232:08.45]She just pushed him.
[232:09.41]And his neck fucking snaps.
[232:11.53]This is the last try.
[232:12.09]I can't fuck it up.
[232:12.87]It's punch, kick, punch.
[232:13.57]Sam, you don't understand.
[232:14.19]This is Dr. Oha.
[232:25.08]And this is Ned Hubbard, the infamous Wirehead.
[232:28.45]How do you do?
[232:30.31]It's a pleasure to finally meet you, monsieur.
[232:35.45]I can hardly wait to hear your story.
[232:37.51]Make sure you do a cartwheel before you fight somebody.
[232:39.63]Get out of here.
[232:42.58]Oh, is that what you want to do?
[232:45.12]Not bad for a Wirehead.

[233:19.94]It's just a matter of what buttons you please She just broke a guy's fucking what about the guard that she just killed actually a little better I have some new technologies that will increase her performance and response time Considerable, why would you be giving this girl fucking extra superpowers?
[233:36.35]That's what we need a female wire head.
[233:38.37]Oh
[233:38.82]She's being rewired as we speak, and we're hoping to get her a little bit more on the side.
[233:44.30]Why am I like Mark Zuckerberg at, like, fucking Facebook Con?
[233:49.16]I had a little help.
[233:50.28]Somebody who basically saved my life.
[233:53.44]Thanks again.
[233:54.18]It was great talking to you.
[233:55.54]My family's waiting for me.
[233:56.54]I'd like to try to relax and just get back to normal.
[233:59.66]Thank you.
[234:00.02]What a fucking fantastic video game.
[234:04.34]Who is it that you keep turning to and addressing?
[234:06.96]What are you talking about?
[234:08.48]You keep turning around and talking to this person and asking for help.
[234:13.02]That was O-Ha's, you know, plan.
[234:15.00]To help me.
[234:16.38]I mean, that's my override.
[234:18.30]So O-Ha, you're talking to O-Ha?
[234:20.08]No, it's not O-Ha.
[234:21.04]No, no.
[234:21.68]It's the person, the player.
[234:24.74]I'd like to leave it at that.
[234:26.12]I just don't understand some of the choices you made.
[234:28.75]Why did you pick someone?
[234:32.26]Is this some kind of interview?
[234:33.56]This is like the tell-tale, like, here are your choices.
[234:36.82]I had to go down the mountain on that bouncy thing and risk my life.
[234:41.52]I'm sorry that I took the wagon, the Jeep, the skateboard, the zodiac, and I rode the pig.
[234:50.67]Neither of you listened to me.
[234:52.89]I had some really good ideas.
[234:54.63]We listened.
[234:55.59]I said go right, you said go left.
[234:57.21]Just say all the things, all the choices you made.
[234:59.37]We listened to you once.
[235:00.25]What was that?
[235:00.91]When we went out of the boat.
[235:02.68]Yeah, they're just going over all the choices.
[235:04.98]Oh, that's so stupid, I love it.
[235:11.02]You know, back, back like 25 fucking years ago, that was, that was a huge deal.
[235:21.24]What a paving the way of revolutionary storytelling, in-game storytelling.
[235:27.26]Wirehead did it.
[235:29.46]This shit was like almost 30 years ago, guys.
[235:32.00]Can you imagine being a little kid and holding the controller?
[235:34.92]No, hold on a minute.
[235:35.70]No little kid is going to beat this game.
[235:37.55]They're going to do left, right, and fail and cry.
[235:40.83]All the adults that played this game, no adults beat this game either.
[235:43.75]I don't know why I'm saying that.
[235:45.45]So, all the people like me, like, you know, me.
[235:48.23]Like, I'm the only person to beat this game.
[235:50.60]So, like, that's pretty cool if I was like 30 years ago.
[236:02.26]I'm the only person that's beat this game.
[236:04.34]Find me somebody else that has.
[236:09.13]Just out of curiosity, I want to see this.
[236:14.85]Only person ever.
[236:16.87]No indicators.
[236:21.12]Oh, they just don't... The indicators aren't on the screen.
[236:24.88]Oh god, that's fucking horrible.
[236:27.04]Alright.
[236:27.20]Alright.
[236:31.09]The guy, what about the guy that made the walkthrough?
[236:34.57]So you don't understand this.
[236:35.73]I fucking wrote that walkthrough.
[236:38.04]I beat this game.
[236:38.88]That's my walkthrough.
[236:39.96]I just didn't want to say it on stream because I didn't want, obviously, like, that's like a, I don't want to like, oh, I'm using my own walkthrough.
[236:49.88]Up the difficulty?
[236:50.72]No, I'm not going to up the difficulty.
[236:53.92]This exact same studio made a Garfield game.
[236:59.60]That's why it was wrong?
[237:01.28]Sure.
[237:02.26]That's why it was wrong.
[237:04.26]Anyways, I've been going for four hours now.
[237:09.28]And I kind of want to take a break.
[237:11.24]I want to get some food and call it a night.
[237:14.63]So the thing is, there's still... There's still like one, two, three, four, five, six.
[237:23.33]There's about like six or seven.
[237:24.75]I think like seven SEGA CD games that I still have.
[237:30.59]And I would probably say just to kind of get them all out of the way.
[237:35.83]There's a couple of good ones in here.
[237:39.56]So don't worry.
[237:40.86]There's at least like two or three good ones.
[237:43.88]So tomorrow, we are going to continue SEGA CD tomorrow.
[237:48.16]Just because the setup is kind of ridiculous.
[237:53.83]There's a lot of like wires and shit and I really don't want to take it all apart.
[237:58.84]And then put it all back together again like next week.
[238:03.08]So... This box full of SEGA CD games we're going to continue tomorrow.
[238:07.87]And we got like two or three good ones.
[238:11.37]Actually, there's a couple that I still have ordered that are like on the way.
[238:14.79]So... We'll see.
[238:17.83]Hopefully we have a good stream tomorrow with the remaining SEGA CD games.
[238:22.67]The Jerma Rumble live action is going to be...
[238:26.46]I want to give myself the week- not BRP, what the fuck am I doing?
[238:30.22]I want to give myself the weekend to make a bunch of characters.
[238:34.78]Because I don't want to rush it, I don't want to like half-ass it.
[238:37.14]I want to... I mean, I have to make a bunch of characters and I haven't been able to do that the last couple of days.
[238:42.91]So this weekend I'm gonna like just sit my ass down and make a bunch of the like new characters that you've seen on stream.
[238:49.29]Because I want it to be a lot of new characters and a lot of old characters, obviously.
[238:53.99]So, I will see you guys tomorrow with more SegaCity.
[238:58.77]Let's blow through the rest of this fucking catalog.
[239:02.41]There's not much left, but there's enough there to probably do another stream, so... Much love, guys.
[239:07.74]Take care.
[239:08.50]Before I go, though, I do want to say thank you.
[239:10.62]There was some pretty large bits that were given over the course of the last hour or so, but I was just so locked in, I couldn't even think.
[239:18.55]Thank you to Tommy Toaster, Squiddy 10.
[239:22.76]Stix Renegade.
[239:23.54]Stix gave $5 again.
[239:26.84]Tell Mitt Romney that everything's gonna be okay.
[239:29.46]Why would I need to tell Mitt Romney things?
[239:31.20]Alright, Mitt Romney, it's gonna be alright.
[239:34.12]Afrin, thanks for the bits.
[239:35.48]They say, hey, Jeremy.
[239:36.38]Hey, Afrin.
[239:37.89]Tula Productions, thank you for the bits as well.
[239:40.83]They officially revoked my gamer license for cheating.
[239:42.91]It's okay.
[239:46.13]I haven't, dude, I haven't had my gamer license.
[239:48.37]I've been fucking streaming video games unlicensed for the last, like, at least six and a half months or so.
[239:55.52]Bengus Tingle, thanks for the bits.
[239:57.40]Tula Productions, again.
[240:00.54]These bits are for Wirehead Jerma Edition and for The Rats 3.
[240:03.19]I had to watch so many Sprint commercials for these bits.
[240:07.39]Hope they will find the development of these professional-grade films.
[240:13.59]Thank you, though.
[240:14.26]Thank you, Tula.
[240:15.78]Also, Dr. Fudge gave 20 bucks a while ago.
[240:19.00]Hopefully you're still here.
[240:21.62]You gave that, like, more than an hour ago.
[240:24.58]Where's the ending where you marry the bear and ride away on a motorcycle together?
[240:29.78]That would have been good.
[240:33.72]But, thank you, Doctor.
[240:36.32]Thank you, good Doctor Fudge.
[240:40.24]Also, what the heck?
[240:42.24]Dreadful Judge and Abysmal Melody, thanks for the bits as well.
[240:45.66]How much did this game cost?
[240:48.00]Uh... Somewhere between $10 and $20.
[240:49.82]I don't know, maybe $12?
[240:50.98]At like, uh, you know... I mean, all these games are on Amazon.
[240:56.27]Uh, Jen betters right at the very end here.
[240:57.99]I was an undercover agent this whole time.
[240:59.47]You're finished.
[241:01.07]Well, fucking... Cha-ching.
[241:02.99]You know what I mean?
[241:03.45]Like, cha-ching.
[241:04.27]Put the cuffs on.
[241:05.23]Cha-ching.
[241:08.21]Anyways, see you tomorrow.
[241:10.39]Thanks, everybody.
[241:10.87]Thanks for all the new subs, too.
[241:12.67]I promise that I am working on a solution for that.
[241:15.57]I'm working on a solution for that.
[241:17.37]I've said that, like, fucking a thousand times.
[241:19.75]But I actually, like, figured out how to do it.
[241:22.36]So, see you guys tomorrow.
[241:24.86]Thank you so much.
[241:26.24]Good night, and goodbye.
