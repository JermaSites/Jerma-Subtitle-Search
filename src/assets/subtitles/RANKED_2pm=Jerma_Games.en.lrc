[ve:60.16.100]

[00:08.64]Nice.
[00:53.94]Rest in peace.
[00:55.76]Yeah, I went on a mission.
[00:57.34]There's a Reaper cop.
[01:03.70]Went on a secret ass mission.
[01:05.62]Fire at will!
[01:29.12]Genji's 25 health.
[01:30.84]Got health kit under 125.
[01:31.62]Divas, probably.
[01:35.59]Hey, guys.
[01:45.23]I tried... I tried to make my stream go live a second ago, and it took... It just sat there for five minutes and nothing happened.
[01:52.94]I thought it was gonna do it again.
[01:53.92]I don't even know...
[02:39.47]Damn it.
[02:40.33]Mercy.
[02:43.53]I can't believe he had Reflect back already.
[02:45.83]Like, he started that fight off with a Reflect and still had another one.
[02:58.92]Ster went offline.
[02:59.82]What's going on?
[03:15.37]Yeah, they seem to have the Genji that doesn't wanna switch.
[03:41.16]Which has been acting weird I think yesterday they said they had a whole bunch of reports of channels not going alive when it said they were alive and stuff like that 76 is on low ground Is that
[04:09.94]Oh, they don't even have a Mercy anymore.
[04:11.78]They're trying a sound barrier.
[04:21.35]Yeah, apparently last night at a certain time every stream that went live didn't actually say that it went live to anyone.
[04:49.00]Oh, we held it, boy.
[04:54.41]Woo!
[04:59.03]Even right now, it seems a little weird.
[05:02.37]Like, it says there's 100 people here, which even... I don't know.
[05:05.66]Normally, it would probably say higher than that.
[05:09.34]Oh, I watched it.
[05:10.36]Oh, no, wait.
[05:10.86]What is he doing?
[05:20.92]I don't know.
[05:21.42]I think the other one there was like two or three other ones that were way better.
[05:24.56]I thought the one on the first point was gonna be the one.
[05:36.34]Be a part of soil.
[05:37.98]Good game guys.
[05:40.71]I just realized be a part of soil will probably be a pretty good like sub sound.
[05:50.16]We're like, you know.
[06:01.73]Oh, I gotta go turn my air conditioner off if you're in the home.
[06:04.11]I always forget.
[06:25.55]Cool, cool, cool.
[06:30.31]Gord said he'll be right back.
[06:32.65]Oh, I got up for a second.
[06:34.87]He is getting coffee real quick.
[06:42.36]Then hold up.
[06:46.34]I gotta do some shit too.
[07:06.29]How was everyone's breakfast?
[07:07.73]I, um... I had chicken parmesan for breakfast.
[07:12.69]It was alright.
[07:13.93]Nothing spectacular, just sitting here with some peach iced tea.
[07:52.03]Give me some tunes.
[07:52.77]Give me some fat beats.
[07:56.81]Give me some, uh... I gave something to my temp.
[08:02.14]Oh, I remember.
[08:04.60]Not that.
[08:09.72]By the time I find something... Yep.
[08:18.16]Hold it.
[08:24.39]I don't know those gamers.
[08:45.83]Oh god.
[08:59.92]I had a dream about me?
[09:07.50]That's not weird.
[09:09.68]I've had weird dreams about people.
[09:14.05]You're fine.
[09:14.79]You'll be okay.
[09:20.39]You're playing ranked.
[09:25.70]Just doing a little bit of a goof, you know?
[09:37.07]You won't be able to goof people.
[09:37.95]What are we doing?
[09:55.96]Together we will not fail I'm gonna bop them off in a sec There was no such bopping
[10:25.93]Reinhardt went really far.
[10:26.89]Didn't fall off, though.
[10:28.02]I guess he's standing far enough back.
[10:32.50]He went on a three-week video game bender that cost him his health, job, and wife!
[10:37.78]Whoa, my wife!
[10:39.06]LS234.
[10:39.38]Is that a, uh... Okay, some people are gonna have to switch classes, because this ain't working out.
[10:51.23]Is that one of the planets with the aliens?
[10:59.20]For that being LV.
[11:05.39]I think we can all play DPS.
[11:08.51]I will play... The Zarya.
[11:11.07]You know what's becoming a trend, guys, in ranked queue?
[11:27.79]I feel like whenever you actually have the Zarya on your team, they're the one that can't hit a Zarya ult.
[11:44.12]Like, Zarya on your team always catches one or no people in the ult.
[11:48.86]We actually last game had someone not use it for about eight minutes.
[11:53.88]Which was equally as depressing.
[11:55.28]Gonna nail it.
[11:56.44]Oh ho, come on.
[11:57.80]That Soldier's real low.
[12:00.74]For a price.
[12:24.01]The good Zaryas are so good, man.
[12:29.34]You just also need good DPS.
[12:34.80]And that McCree who keeps rolling in front of everyone is questionable.
[12:47.75]There's really only a minute left.
[12:57.92]Seriously, McCree likes walking face-first into that Reinhardt.
[13:14.43]Whatever is happening is not good.
[13:22.91]Well, I mean...
[13:29.95]You can't stun Reinhardt's shield, by the way.
[13:32.41]It's down to the point.
[13:41.94]Rush it.
[13:45.50]Just trying to let him know.
[13:48.96]Finally, he can use his ult.
[14:02.38]Jesus, this is bad.
[14:04.92]Shit.
[14:06.92]Thank god, we didn't even get first floor.
[14:09.00]That was much harder than it needed to be.
[14:13.82]Yeah.
[14:14.60]Are they even in here?
[14:17.03]I mean... Whatever.
[14:30.35]The game is about switching characters to counter others, but... I'm Hanzo, man.
[14:41.84]How's everyone doing this fine morning?
[14:44.84]Good evening.
[14:46.48]Oh, it is an evening, isn't it?
[14:48.90]Actually, no, it's still kind of morning.
[14:50.82]It's always morning.
[15:05.14]I cannot believe that stunned me and worked out in his favor.
[15:09.36]With 25 health left.
[15:10.72]This is one of those games.
[15:24.01]Yo guys, if we're running out of time and the class you're using is not working out, wouldn't you want to switch jobs?
[15:35.30]There is only one guy.
[15:36.56]I have Zarya ult coming in a sec.
[15:40.14]Roadhog is the only one I'm worried about.
[15:49.55]We gotta keep pushing.
[15:52.83]They have a Roadhog in this tunnel.
[16:00.07]This JackNap, the guy needs to kill his Tracer, but he won't.
[16:08.50]Jesus Christ.
[16:11.04]Well, I've been winning all morning.
[16:12.88]I went from 72 up to 75 in a win streak.
[16:17.46]I knew the second I turned my stream on, like, this shit was gonna happen.
[16:25.87]He played triceps guy, played nothing but Bastion last game, attack and defense.
[16:32.60]Prepare your defenses.
[16:36.00]I wonder why... Shut up, nerd.
[16:43.23]Okay, rank 66.
[16:43.95]It was rank 61 talking to you, bitch.
[16:51.18]Wow.
[16:51.84]Yeah, it's even worse, but okay.
[17:19.01]Have you watched the Honest Train with the developers?
[17:28.71]It was good, thanks.
[17:30.17]I wish it was better.
[17:31.21]I've thought of so many things that could have made it better since then.
[17:36.31]It's a rough life, man.
[17:53.64]System check initiated.
[17:55.34]Green across the board.
[17:57.10]I'm ready for action.
[18:05.83]Five, four, three, two, one.
[18:10.83]Attackers incoming.
[18:14.40]Stop the payload.
[18:22.95]God damn Genjis.
[18:24.56]Not gonna have anything to stop their Reinhardt is what my biggest fear is.
[18:46.84]yeah like they're just gonna walk us back because they have a reinhardt and we have like five dps that can't shoot it my team needs me
[19:04.04]Did you play some matches and you got 58?
[19:08.38]All of my friends got higher than 58.
[19:10.02]Etalyx, Boo, Jerma, everybody got higher than 58.
[19:12.51]So I think the truth is just that I'm a trash can.
[19:16.85]If I wanted him to kill me, it'd be better off for me to respawn.
[19:40.85]No, neither of them have switched off McCree or Hanzo.
[19:50.32]Oh shit.
[19:50.72]He switched off Hanzo I think the McCree was worse to be honest just because he was walking forward at Reinhardt shields and Flashing it dead in the center not even trying to like flash over it or anything.
[20:00.38]Oh
[20:05.20]They had a Tracer killing us all last game, I don't think she got shot at once.
[20:41.27]Damn.
[20:44.87]Yeah, head retard.
[20:51.47]I had the pleasure of playing with him last game as well.
[20:54.00]I feel sorry for you.
[20:58.00]I can't believe you can't.
[21:00.14]I wish I could block playing with people.
[21:04.54]Yeah, you used to be able to avoid players.
[21:08.61]But then you'd win more and be cheating.
[21:21.44]Well, turn the stream on and lose the first game.
[21:23.28]You know how it is.
[21:23.82]I probably lost 75 that game, actually, because I was barely into 75.
[21:35.21]Yep.
[21:37.25]Is your ratings too high and then we get fucking retarded 60s to balance out our teams?
[21:45.37]It's all your fault.
[21:46.83]Nah, blocking doesn't avoid people the way that it used to.
[21:49.95]Why are they so braindead?
[21:53.67]I like Hanzo and the arrows.
[21:57.70]I wouldn't mind, but...
[22:00.20]McCree kept walking in against four people and flashbanging Reinhardt's shield, not even trying to flash over it.
[22:06.72]He really?
[22:08.00]Yeah, every time I saw him he was just walking at the group and just... I don't fucking know.
[22:14.19]I hope that's on stream.
[22:16.69]A couple of times, yeah.
[22:19.97]Oh shit, we're mad underdogs.
[22:21.79]Oh god.
[22:22.41]God.
[22:22.53]No wonder we're underdogs.
[22:26.43]I was going to wait to Q too because I knew this was going to happen.
[22:29.93]I'm about to leave the game though.
[22:32.35]Do it.
[22:33.99]No, you won't.
[22:36.40]I mean, fuck it.
[22:38.20]Oh my god, 75% penalty to XP earned.
[22:40.30]Fuck, I am not going to...
[22:55.13]Fuck it, just take another loss.
[22:57.83]I will protect the innocent.
[23:01.19]Well, we're gonna push out.
[23:04.37]System check initiated.
[23:05.21]Yeah, but you know he's probably just gonna be on speed the whole time.
[23:07.86]I'm ready for action.
[23:21.52]Oh, he left.
[23:23.22]One of them left.
[23:24.18]Thank god.
[23:24.80]Thank god.
[23:25.58]Please don't rejoin.
[23:26.58]Please don't rejoin.
[23:34.62]Thank god.
[23:35.40]Let's wait for those people to queue.
[23:39.91]I'm just... I'm just chillin'.
[23:43.89]How's your morning so far, man?
[23:47.53]It went really well until I turned my stream on.
[23:56.61]I mean, I hope your fans like McCree's flash banging into Orion RG.
[24:06.14]This song is too loud.
[24:07.92]Cue whenever your gut tells you to cue so you can avoid these guys.
[24:11.73]It's what's weird is they avoided us.
[24:16.67]Oh, God.
[24:21.60]The other team was stacked, but are any of them in the group?
[24:25.84]I don't know.
[24:30.48]Healthy and balanced breakfast?
[24:35.40]I had chicken parmesan.
[24:37.99]Oh, thank god.
[24:55.54]That's when you get them on the other team and they fucking wreck you.
[24:59.01]Every time you walk out of spawn, you get Hanzo headshot.
[25:01.39]Like, whoa!
[25:03.75]Yeah, right.
[25:07.51]It's carried!
[25:08.41]And then the McCree's flashbangs are on point.
[25:14.08]Yep, doesn't miss a headshot.
[25:20.08]So they play Jarian and Roadhog?
[25:30.25]Spoiled white kid?
[25:31.51]For sure.
[25:32.91]For sure, for sure.
[25:33.97]I woke up one day.
[25:36.35]And I just had a stream.
[25:48.42]Because my mom gave it to me.
[25:49.98]That's why I picked this, by the way.
[25:51.44]Come to me, come to me!
[25:52.80]What a weebo.
[26:16.86]And I'm white.
[26:17.82]That's true.
[26:18.68]That I can't argue with.
[26:19.98]And that's the day I died.
[26:20.93]Ow.
[27:13.84]I knew that shit was gonna happen.
[27:15.22]I was just trying to concussion blast away from him.
[27:19.74]I haven't done anything this game.
[27:23.46]I'm just gonna turn my stream off.
[27:25.12]You know?
[27:32.98]I will not waste this opportunity.
[27:39.67]There's a Roadhog up here.
[27:40.79]I got 76 off high ground.
[27:45.25]Shields breaking.
[28:04.12]Where's the Mercy?
[28:04.88]Goddammit.
[28:06.46]Mercy's dead, I guess.
[28:07.28]Well, I don't really need to recall here.
[28:32.78]We can't get their tanks.
[28:35.26]Thanks for the assist.
[28:38.03]I'll switch.
[28:38.83]I'm good.
[28:39.49]I have sunburn.
[28:48.37]I have aimbot and seven birds.
[28:54.32]Okay, I got aim.
[28:56.74]Roadhog's up top left.
[29:03.69]Where the hell did she go?
[29:04.72]Like, I am losing track of this Mercy so bad.
[29:09.34]All she did was dash in a straight line and she's gone.
[29:12.16]Not to mention that she, like, did it through me.
[29:24.65]Just turn the stream off, I kinda really want to.
[29:30.71]Eating a deep dish pizza, it's good.
[29:32.00]Is there anything you would like to see would benefit from season 2 besides what Blizzard is proposing?
[29:36.60]Dish.
[29:37.52]Good.
[29:46.17]No, not really.
[29:46.87]They're proposing everything that needs to change.
[29:49.79]I just want to see shorter time limits.
[29:51.57]But they said they were going to do that.
[29:52.69]3 hit.
[30:03.01]Lost track of the mercy.
[30:06.29]How is she over there?
[30:08.22]I don't know Enemy contact
[30:34.94]I think I'm just gonna ignore the fact that I'm streaming and try and win.
[30:45.73]Sadly, you kinda have to do one right sometimes.
[31:06.26]I killed their whole fucking team, so... Nice job, nice job.
[31:10.09]Yeah, nice job.
[31:10.99]Holy shit.
[31:11.41]Are you sure I'm awake?
[31:13.89]I'm awake!
[31:14.83]Are you pro senpai?
[31:31.64]I mean, the plan was to kill 50 health soldier and then turn and immediately shoot the Mercy that was right next to him.
[31:40.58]And then she was just gone again!
[32:16.85]Well, she was res for one dude.
[32:19.23]You're alone, Jesus.
[32:21.29]Yeah, I don't know why I went in.
[32:25.36]TBH.
[32:27.14]I got my ult, though, so... Pharah isn't feeling very useful, though.
[32:37.16]Their whole team is random, is carrying them with the Mercy damage boost.
[32:42.74]Is what it feels like from my perspective, at least.
[32:46.86]Whoa!
[32:47.00]Docma!
[32:47.72]Sup, boy?
[33:18.46]Master, blame Pharah for your failure.
[33:20.62]Nah, all of the DPS is coming from a damage boosted Soldier.
[33:23.92]Why would you even play Pharah against that?
[33:26.37]Unless you as well were getting damage boosted to make it slightly even.
[33:30.59]Watch out behind you guys.
[33:36.91]Reaper's up top.
[33:41.33]Reaper's behind you guys.
[33:52.14]Are you kidding me?
[33:53.00]I got dragon blade for next push.
[33:56.46]I got mind.
[33:57.96]And we have red.
[34:01.90]Someone bought a second floor.
[34:10.07]What's your sound barrier?
[34:11.69]My ultimate is charging.
[34:13.11]Can you speed boost?
[34:14.47]When do you have your speed boost?
[34:15.95]5.
[34:17.01]I want a speed boost and a manolo.
[34:19.01]Shield's rolling.
[34:25.97]I don't know why.
[34:26.59]God fucking damn it.
[34:32.75]Can you not cancel melee into reflect the same way you can cancel it into a dash?
[34:52.23]Now I know
[35:12.25]No, you can't.
[35:14.22]That's why I took, like, 100 points of damage from the first Reaper shot.
[35:18.18]I was like, oh, I'm just gonna, like, do as much damage as I can, then reflect.
[35:23.39]No!
[35:28.51]I learned something today.
[35:29.61]At least there was that.
[35:30.37]Oh, god!
[35:41.79]I shouldn't have dashed, fuck.
[35:49.74]I should have gotten Genji a long time ago though.
[35:52.04]I still need more Genji practice, obviously.
[35:54.00]If we rez one guy, or what?
[36:12.39]Thank you.
[36:13.09]Score 2-0.
[36:17.01]Switching sides.
[36:21.42]Prepare your defenses.
[36:45.19]This comp is kind of shitty, what can you do?
[36:51.07]Either Sumatra Lúcio or Sumatra Mercy or Mercy Lúcio.
[36:55.05]Okay, that's better.
[37:04.25]You can go Mercy.
[37:05.03]I believe.
[37:11.64]I believe in the Torb, man.
[37:21.35]I believe in the Torb more than I believe in my 76.
[37:24.03]That's not gonna have damage boost.
[37:43.29]I'll be busy soon enough.
[37:54.65]Five, four, three, two, one.
[37:59.24]I don't know how this shit works.
[38:01.64]Defend objective A. What?
[38:07.54]Ooh.
[38:13.70]Watch the car.
[38:18.22]Oh shit, Genji's dead.
[38:22.86]Good, Genji.
[38:24.31]Got a Genji back here.
[38:30.31]God, everyone's chasing him.
[38:34.87]Kinda need our Junkrat spamming that.
[38:36.39]This is pretty what?
[38:37.15]Fuck.
[38:43.40]And she's still way behind us.
[38:45.96]My ultimate is ready.
[38:49.60]Powered up.
[38:50.68]Oh, shit.
[38:51.16]The line hung.
[38:57.56]Heroes never die.
[39:16.27]I feel like Genji's just gonna kill our Mercy a shit ton.
[39:29.84]There's not much I can do to stop it.
[39:31.42]In this scenario we play Pharah over 76.
[39:36.34]Tons of them.
[39:45.06]There's one hero limit.
[39:48.18]You have a Mercy that's willing to pocket your Pharah.
[40:02.29]You need to contest some high grounds.
[40:06.08]You gotta push some Reinhardts off of some high grounds with your concussions.
[40:09.68]She's really good on Hollywood.
[40:13.58]Come on guys, we can defend this.
[40:14.84]Play smart.
[40:18.38]I would try.
[40:19.82]They're coming up top or going around, either one.
[40:23.86]They went around?
[40:24.50]They went around.
[40:24.98]Underneath you guys.
[40:26.18]76 is up top.
[40:30.30]Fuck.
[40:36.13]What the fuck?
[40:38.63]God damn it.
[40:39.33]I had to win that 76 fight.
[40:48.34]Good hold, guys.
[40:55.32]I didn't even get a tick.
[40:57.00]But I ain't no 76.
[41:00.67]Don't chase for a frag, guys.
[41:02.09]Yeah, don't chase him.
[41:04.73]Why don't I auto-lock Hanzo?
[41:08.21]I don't know.
[41:09.03]I honestly feel like my Hanzo is better than my 76, though.
[41:14.69]Payment for services rendered.
[41:15.91]Pleasure doing business.
[41:18.18]But it doesn't even matter, because 76 is just better than Hanzo.
[41:21.18]99% of the time.
[41:22.90]What the hell?
[41:24.80]What the hell?
[41:25.32]Tell me I'm not getting bonered.
[41:57.16]Nice!
[41:57.48]Good fucking hold, guys.
[42:02.82]Good job.
[42:03.96]Wow, I'm surprised in us.
[42:06.28]Good job.
[42:06.90]I'm surprised we did that.
[42:10.17]Yeah, that Mercy had really good reses.
[42:15.51]That's funny.
[42:16.97]During the hero pose at the end, you could actually see us... You could actually see where the cart had to end up.
[42:25.67]Yeah, good job Mercy, by the way.
[42:32.22]He had good reses.
[42:33.38]I'm proud.
[42:38.23]Let him know.
[42:38.77]Let the Mercys know.
[42:39.71]Or appreciate it.
[42:41.97]It's nice to be appreciated.
[43:06.74]Just gotta win three games to get back where we were.
[43:08.71]We were underdogs that game.
[43:12.02]Apparently that's how bad I played.
[43:35.73]I don't understand that rank gain.
[44:04.99]What's a Jerma game?
[44:12.65]Most commonly referred to as... Games with my friend Jerma.
[44:21.98]That are not Overwatch.
[44:24.94]Though I knew pretty much no one was gonna know what that meant.
[44:27.42]Well, not pretty much no one.
[44:29.59]But a decent chunk of people.
[44:31.35]Who's Jerma?
[44:36.38]Who is that?
[44:36.86]I've never heard of him.
[44:44.82]Again, I think I'm going to know from the beginning that their whole team is the same people as last time.
[44:50.14]Just damage boosting random.
[44:51.87]He's probably going to be playing hitscan characters.
[44:55.49]I don't think I'm going to get much use out of Farah.
[45:06.46]What?
[45:13.68]Attack commences in 30 seconds.
[45:22.19]Yo, what the fuck is going on here already?
[45:24.99]I don't know who to play.
[45:27.87]I don't know, but I'm definitely not a D.Va and I... This whole D.Va Tracer thing has me confused.
[45:36.64]Oh my god.
[45:37.58]He's a Zarya player, remember?
[45:43.67]I remember.
[46:09.93]Oh boy Pretty much got a one-shot the the mercy.
[46:34.78]Otherwise the Genji pick isn't good, but I feel really I
[46:40.26]Not very good about one-shotting their Mercy.
[46:49.53]Or anybody.
[46:50.55]But I almost have Dragonblade, so now it's kind of too late to switch.
[46:53.73]I should have just built up Dragonblade and not gone in.
[46:56.28]I had Lúcio boost, and it was pretty much worn off by the time I got there.
[47:02.84]I just... I don't know what to play here.
[47:08.41]I should probably be Zarya, but then we have like three tanks.
[47:12.37]Yeah, I think we're losing this one.
[47:27.18]I don't think we want it to win.
[47:40.56]Ever since I saw what we picked.
[47:42.84]I got caught on a cactus.
[47:54.73]I suck dicks.
[48:11.25]I think y'all worry about team comp too much in the team game.
[48:24.34]I agree.
[48:35.96]Did you just break it down?
[48:38.24]Yeah, I guess.
[48:39.04]Let's go, they're back for more!
[49:24.53]Let me actually do something this game Nope missed
[49:54.86]Where's the concede button, yo?
[50:04.64]I dunno, that game I just... My Genji is ass, I know that.
[50:15.77]But I think I got put into a situation where...
[50:23.27]Couldn't play anything else Being asset Genji felt like the best choice There's no way we're gonna get this they don't even have to push they only have to get the first checkpoint I
[51:06.09]With every death comes honor.
[51:09.09]With honor, redemption.
[51:23.95]Attackers incoming in 30 seconds.
[51:36.81]I grow tired of waiting.
[51:38.43]I have to get it to right there.
[51:47.35]That's like impossible.
[51:48.81]Five, four, three, two, one.
[51:53.99]Attackers incoming.
[51:55.87]Locked.
[51:57.54]Stop the payload.
[52:08.51]I'm throwing now I climbed to that wall.
[52:25.12]I did not want to climb that wall because I pulled my arrow back.
[52:33.45]I Will not be defeated so easily
[52:38.71]The payload is approaching its destination.
[52:41.89]Tracer here!
[52:42.43]Get back!
[52:45.57]Nice work!
[52:49.37]Here's the pay.
[53:07.25]I'm, like, never gonna queue on Sundays again.
[53:19.84]Respect veggie burgers as burgers?
[53:21.86]I mean, yeah, sure, I mean, they're cop-outs, but, sure.
[53:47.02]Look at that.
[53:48.24]Look at that!
[53:49.68]Weren't we underdogs again?
[53:50.92]I just- we just beat them and got like that much experience.
[54:01.05]Dude, that was the same team we just beat.
[54:04.37]Why did I only get, like, one-fifth of what we lost?
[54:10.53]I can invite Man of Snow and Urky if you want to keep getting more people so we can get less... less people.
[54:19.47]I think we just need to accept what they've picked and court Pocket Me on Pharah.
[54:29.26]Because otherwise, I was just jumping around like an idiot on Genji.
[54:40.24]Rather than complaining that they didn't pick Mercy, we should just have one anyway.
[54:45.90]Uh, Kort, can you play Mercy?
[54:47.14]Because I sure can't.
[54:49.38]Yeah, I'll play Mercy.
[54:50.06]I got Mana Stone here and whatever.
[54:54.10]Uh, ManofSnow is in a queue.
[54:56.70]He's in a game.
[54:58.69]He was like halfway in a game while we were just finishing.
[55:03.71]You guys wanna take a short break?
[55:04.69]I'm gonna grab some food.
[55:09.57]I don't care, I'll come eat later.
[55:12.21]He's with someone, I think.
[55:14.01]So I don't know.
[55:16.62]I say let's just go and... Yeah.
[55:20.82]Play to our strengths.
[55:29.31]After one more loss, I don't think I can play this game anymore today.
[55:33.13]It's only 12.
[55:33.69]This is why I'm asking Corp to play Mercy.
[55:37.70]Because that's what he plays.
[55:40.48]And he hasn't been.
[55:42.46]We like invited him to be the support in our group.
[55:58.02]It's just, this is what usually happens, is you have, like, a three-man group that has a synergy together, and then we all end up playing characters we have, like, that we shouldn't be playing.
[56:13.79]I think Jesus was on, like, Widowmaker that game.
[56:18.97]Fort's been playing Roadhog.
[56:21.59]I was on Genji the last two games.
[56:27.41]If you're three people, you're half the team.
[56:29.37]And if you have a three-person strategy that works for you, you just go for it.
[56:40.26]Then, granted, the second that you have a team without a Reinhardt, you'll probably lose anyway, but still.
[56:58.95]Are you here, Court?
[57:01.50]Yeah, what's up?
[57:03.58]My chat's being dumb.
[57:31.46]What are you saying to your Arcata?
[57:33.40]Well, everyone kind of agrees that three people groups are the fastest way to rank up, because then you actually get experience when you win, which is again why I'm so confused we didn't get experience when we were underdogs and we beat the same team that we just lost to.
[57:48.95]But if you have three people, that's usually how it goes, is you have like, you either have a support or a tank.
[58:00.09]And I usually end up playing with, like, myself and another DPS player.
[58:06.93]And then the second you don't have either a support or a tank on the other three people that join, it skews everything.
[58:20.08]Can't have everything with three people, you know?
[58:22.43]Because there's, like, a whole other half of the team.
[58:48.28]Why don't you guys just fill?
[58:49.20]That's the problem.
[58:50.44]That's, look, it's a complex problem.
[58:56.46]Here's what happens.
[58:59.27]When you queue as like, Jesus is rank 77 right now.
[59:05.29]When you queue as rank 77 and he's like a good 76 and Reaper and like hitscan player.
[59:11.16]You get matched against with 50s to try and bring your group average down.
[59:16.88]So it places you with 50s.
[59:18.42]The 59 is going to pick 76.
[59:21.20]And then Jesus is going to play a tank.
[59:23.47]And then it's like, why did we even queue?
[59:26.37]He picked Winston and we win.
[59:27.75]There you go.
[59:32.19]Actually, Winston on defense is bizarre.
[59:37.71]Yeah, so he picked 76.
[59:38.95]So he'll play Roadhog.
[59:41.05]And you get all flipped.
[59:41.85]So we try and fill, but it's definitely more awkward when you try and fill.
[59:50.99]And then you have people like, Poon Troop, dude, they're setting up everything for me.
[59:54.29]Poon Troop says, carry me, you 70s.
[59:56.89]Like a three-plate squad.
[59:58.05]I don't even know what a three-plate squad is.
[60:00.01]But Poon Troop is the weird guy playing Winston on defense.
[60:02.85]Like, I played it with a level 55 Bastion on attack that was saying, whoa, I have the 70s, I win.
[60:09.82]But it's not that simple.
[60:12.62]Because if you're the 55 attack Bastion, I can't, we can't carry you.
[60:17.26]You have to help a little bit.
[60:18.92]I'm not too upset about a Winston.
[60:21.82]Like, I ain't gonna be like, yeah, he should've been Reinhardt, but hey, he should've been Reinhardt.
[60:36.45]Why do high ranks assume low ranks are bad when they could have bad luck?
[60:41.67]Why do low ranks assume 70s are bad?
[60:46.39]Ricochet, why are you assuming...
[60:50.37]And we can't handle our shit.
[60:57.60]50s are pretty significantly bad luck compared to a 70.
[61:02.10]If you have that much bad luck... You might have to start admitting that you're ranked 50 for a reason.
[61:21.09]No?
[61:21.49]Am I being an asshole?
[61:38.42]Zarya and me on point.
[61:49.64]All I'm saying is that if we try and fill it usually goes really badly because we're getting off the classes that we're good at and the whole reason we're grouped together is because we can play classes that work well together, right?
[62:15.67]Otherwise, we just solo queue.
[62:17.95]Can you at least agree on that?
[62:23.07]Is that in solo queue?
[62:24.17]Yeah, sure, just fill.
[62:25.17]But if you're three people and you had like a plan and a reason why you're queuing as three people and you're half the team and you think your half of the team can do a really good job, then you end up playing characters you're awful at.
[62:43.90]Okay, that sucked.
[62:45.82]Zarya's super hurt.
[62:50.04]Worked out.
[62:50.85]I gotta turn this music off, I forgot it was on.
[62:55.59]Oh, fuck my life.
[63:05.91]If you were a real 70, wouldn't you be good at all classes?
[63:08.96]The problem also is that chat can't ever accept an answer, ever.
[63:13.38]Get your res off of me.
[63:17.81]Last game, we were playing against another 3-person queue of 70s.
[63:21.58]We're a 3-person queue of 70s, and they're a 3-person queue of 70s, so in that sense, we're even, right?
[63:28.00]However, their 3-person played Mercy 76 every game, and they had their other Persona Reaper every game.
[63:35.41]That's pretty much exactly what we want to have happen.
[63:39.33]However...
[63:40.84]They got to play the classes they're good at, and we got to play like Genji, Roadhog, and I don't even fucking remember what.
[63:56.65]So when they have the really good damage boost at 76, are they gonna win?
[64:01.21]Yeah!
[64:05.55]Damage boost to carry is insanely good in this game.
[64:24.51]Oh it just feels like sometimes you play an Overwatch no matter what you say someone has a rebuttal.
[64:38.82]You're always wrong.
[64:40.22]It's hard to always be wrong eight hours a day.
[64:49.52]Can you sympathize with that?
[65:16.64]I wanted to go get that Mercy, but I don't want to overextend.
[65:19.02]I think I'm better off just chillin'.
[65:21.72]The only way I can be right is if I'm Seagull.
[65:46.32]I can't do that.
[65:55.03]Score.
[65:56.65]Zero to zero.
[65:58.95]Switching sides.
[66:03.32]Prepare to attack.
[66:30.52]I mean, you are.
[66:31.18]Several.
[66:43.41]I say several, but I think it's just two.
[66:50.57]No, three is several.
[66:59.65]Quit screwing around and get ready to move.
[67:11.61]Attack commences in 30 seconds.
[67:14.41]System check initiated.
[67:16.11]Green across the board.
[67:17.91]I'm ready for action.
[67:19.91]Oh, oh, time to accelerate.
[67:24.47]I can't wait to see you all in action.
[67:30.42]Three is several?
[67:32.54]Then what is a few?
[67:34.07]Ah shit!
[67:34.69]I guess four is several and three is a few.
[67:38.57]He just loves Winston.
[67:45.60]Blind by me.
[68:00.80]After this, you guys want to go through?
[68:02.30]Speed boost us?
[68:03.28]I don't know.
[68:04.46]Holy shit, he's hitting every shot.
[68:09.22]What a Torbjörn.
[68:10.00]I'm just gonna wait for this.
[68:15.47]We're in on the lane.
[68:16.25]Go fucking monkey, man.
[68:49.25]Good job monkey!
[68:51.03]I went from being a relatable gamer to a bully?
[69:00.36]How was I a bully?
[69:04.14]What did I do?
[69:04.82]I'm no bully.
[69:35.47]I just try and be good, man.
[69:37.91]I stood up for the Winston.
[69:40.29]I stood up for the Winston!
[69:41.65]Okay, four more of those.
[69:55.88]We'll be good.
[69:56.38]How close to the golden weapon?
[70:00.40]I think about 25 more.
[70:11.44]Do you want to talk to the teammates?
[70:12.46]Because I was talking to my chat.
[70:15.62]My chat.
[70:16.84]Or my teammates.
[70:17.62]It's hard to do both.
[70:24.43]Wait, what?
[70:28.33]Yeah, the new Marvel movie, Man of Snow.
[70:35.66]What about it?
[70:37.56]No, no, the guy in the game called me in a snap.
[70:42.43]Are we waiting for him or what?
[70:44.37]No, no, he's... Let me ask...
[71:04.86]Not like you're playing competitive for rank right now.
[71:06.88]I like, I half am.
[71:11.12]If I wasn't playing for rank, I'd be in a more than three person party.
[71:15.10]The way I'd look at it.
[71:16.48]Oh, you could queue if you want.
[71:23.16]There's not that many people on Sunday morning.
[71:25.37]He said we're in the first half of Nubani.
[71:49.64]How many wins to Golden Gun?
[71:50.78]Good question.
[71:51.58]About 25.
[71:59.09]What else?
[71:59.49]Did you play for fun?
[72:00.69]I am playing for fun.
[72:06.74]That's half of it.
[72:29.30]How many wins still gold with?
[72:30.56]Good question.
[72:32.02]About 25.
[72:32.22]What weapon are you buying, Jesus?
[72:53.07]13 more wins?
[72:55.29]Oh, he's stalking me.
[73:01.19]I might buy Tracer or Reaper.
[73:05.26]I forced Jerma to stream?
[73:06.42]Yeah, I did.
[73:07.64]I have a game I want to play on Jerma as the game wants to play, so pretty soon in two hours.
[73:15.82]For the first time in a long time, I'm going to stream not Overwatch.
[73:23.61]I want to try Necropolis.
[73:24.81]I hear it's bad, but it still looks kind of fun, at least for a little bit.
[73:30.78]I'm gonna play that with Jeremiah.
[73:32.82]At least for a little bit.
[73:34.14]Then he has some really dumb game he wants to play that should actually be a lot of fun and I don't want to spoil what it is.
[73:44.18]Let's do this guys.
[74:15.55]I guess this goes back to what I'm saying.
[74:18.80]Would you rather have a 74 Pharah or a 57 Pharah?
[74:21.70]Someone who mostly only plays Pharah.
[74:24.10]I'm curious how many hours Rob has.
[74:27.60]That's why we're gonna dig into his life right now.
[74:29.49]Our game's won.
[74:36.77]Plays a little bit of Pharah.
[74:40.77]But then not to be like a conceited asshole.
[74:44.89]The second stage, that is.
[74:46.27]Fine, he can play Pharah.
[74:47.33]I don't care if he plays Pharah.
[74:49.01]It honestly shouldn't affect us.
[74:53.78]I'm confident on my Pharah.
[74:56.26]We're just gonna play our game.
[74:57.42]Kort's gonna play Mercy and not, like, try and fill.
[75:00.38]We have a whole game plan.
[75:01.92]So the other half of the team, whatever he wants to do... Let him do it.
[75:07.02]That's fine.
[75:09.21]But I think we've been trying to fill too much to, like... Help support...
[75:15.61]57 Paris you know what I mean nice work here's the pay one attackers incoming defend objective a don't worry my friends I have your shield damage boosted 76 again though I need healing
[75:46.13]I have a Widowmaker way in the back.
[75:48.17]Alright, what?!
[76:01.65]Oh my god, I got concussioned into hell.
[76:04.21]That was like the most perfect concussion blast ever.
[76:07.63]No, I wanna see the Pharah's perspective!
[76:09.33]That was outrageous!
[76:14.51]Oh god.
[76:18.81]I don't think I wasn't worth it.
[76:21.57]The fuck is their Pharah?
[76:24.57]That was a nice shot too.
[76:25.63]I think it's just the three of us in here.
[76:39.00]I wasn't even in here.
[76:40.30]Oh shit.
[76:40.92]Oh wait nevermind.
[77:00.24]Bad res by Mercy, yeah.
[77:07.81]I concur.
[77:16.88]Mercy threw like both of our lives away.
[77:30.81]Before I started streaming, we were playing with Shadow and Mercy.
[77:34.98]The damage boosted Pharah was the strat.
[77:37.30]And it seemed pretty good.
[77:38.38]Because that's a good strat.
[77:41.95]But Quartzman damage boosting... I don't even know what.
[77:45.13]I think he just killed himself again.
[78:09.94]Lost that point.
[78:10.66]Believe this game's totally lost?
[78:22.59]I...
[78:33.17]I think we can push it on attack.
[78:35.15]I feel like this part, like, yeah, we lost on defense.
[78:39.15]Probably.
[78:39.87]But unfortunately, the way ranked works, it honestly doesn't matter.
[78:45.40]It's like, we can just get this done with faster.
[79:03.15]No chance.
[79:03.95]Are Pharah's shitting on you?
[79:37.27]Because they have six players on their team alive at all times To three switching sides Prepare to attack
[80:52.73]I don't even... I feel like it's gonna have to be Shit Genji again.
[81:31.15]Do you ever get teamed with higher ranked randoms?
[81:33.63]I don't think that has ever happened.
[81:36.15]Payment for services rendered.
[81:37.35]Pleasure doing business.
[81:39.70]I mean, if you solo queue, maybe you'll get like someone 70s, in the higher 70s.
[81:46.36]But if you party with a group, it's never gonna happen.
[82:05.22]What happened to my game plan?
[82:06.32]I don't know.
[82:06.74]Court wouldn't heal me anyway.
[82:07.70]My game plan was damage boosted pocket at Pharah.
[82:19.55]Pharah without a Mercy is like two-thirds of a... one-third of a character.
[82:39.62]And I honestly don't know why I'm even bothering on Genji though.
[82:47.21]Did I ask him to talk to me?
[82:51.25]Like three games ago.
[82:54.85]I've got you in my sights.
[83:11.24]Now the plan is, I hope this guy gets Graviton, and I hope it works out, and I hope I can Dragonblade it.
[83:29.95]Oh my god.
[83:31.67]I didn't even fucking know they had a Junkrat!
[83:44.37]I never saw their Junkrat.
[83:58.46]Told you guys, got him.
[83:59.96]He got the point.
[84:01.08]Ouch.
[84:13.14]Jumped over his grenade like 30 seconds ago.
[84:15.74]Sorry.
[84:16.52]I do think I'm kind of tilted.
[84:18.12]Chat's been insulting me for like two hours.
[84:21.96]My ultimate is ready.
[84:26.67]Go.
[84:39.20]I'll be watching over you.
[84:46.94]Waste this chance.
[84:47.87]Let's keep moving.
[84:51.98]No one can hide.
[85:24.09]That was a good hook.
[85:38.34]They all dead though.
[85:40.12]Zarya's gone into silent mode.
[85:43.78]I'm not angry.
[85:44.52]I'm just...
[85:49.69]Not full angry.
[85:53.53]I played like six games before I turned the stream on.
[85:57.28]They were fun.
[85:58.10]We won them all.
[85:59.16]I turned my stream on.
[86:00.14]We had one shit game.
[86:03.76]The only reason you would turn your stream on is to talk to your chat.
[86:07.59]And it's not worth reading.
[86:09.95]Or talking to.
[86:10.65]I'm just gonna play the game.
[86:13.53]You know?
[86:20.21]If reading chat is making me play that much worse, I'm just going to play my game.
[86:25.93]Heroes never die.
[86:28.83]Farfraks.
[86:37.68]Harden stab me.
[86:54.93]Nice, nice, nice, nice.
[86:56.93]Nice work.
[86:57.67]Here's the pay.
[86:59.61]Blast Bomb.
[87:04.73]Guys, relax.
[87:05.63]I'm not angry.
[87:07.13]Just disappointed.
[87:08.49]Nice thesaurus, Blast Bomb.
[87:11.74]Thanks, man.
[87:12.18]Sudden death.
[87:22.34]Just have a good def.
[88:04.36]I think biggest thing here is gonna be shutting down their Pharah.
[88:06.64]Because they're probably just gonna run, grab on Pharah and whoever was pocking them again.
[88:13.04]And 76 is always really good on this point.
[88:21.17]I might give this a shot.
[88:22.25]Hopefully they don't jump in with four Winstons.
[88:26.31]Chicken lover.
[88:28.82]Thanks for the chicken wings.
[88:33.66]I'll make sure to eat daily chicken wings.
[88:54.01]Well, okay
[89:20.54]These tables are honestly really annoying.
[89:23.32]Uh, right side?
[89:32.53]Do we have two Zaryas?
[89:35.35]Yeah, they're running double Zarya.
[89:36.93]Double Zarya, watch out for that shit.
[89:44.55]A lot over here.
[89:53.60]Running double Zarya.
[89:57.27]If you die, Junkbag can you go for Reaper?
[90:00.81]Whoops.
[90:22.00]This is actually going pretty well as long as they don't Graviton us.
[90:24.34]As long as we don't get Graviton, we'll win.
[90:28.93]Oh, it's coming.
[90:30.17]Mercy, support, make sure you hide.
[90:33.25]No.
[90:36.69]I have my own.
[90:37.71]It's not important right now.
[90:43.91]I've got you in my sights.
[90:45.73]Here they come in now.
[90:47.33]Their Mercy's dead.
[90:55.59]Oh, we did it, boys.
[90:56.43]Good job, guys.
[91:01.23]We did it, Ma.
[91:02.65]I missed a chair.
[91:03.53]That chair's hard to get out.
[91:05.43]You have to get it all around the table.
[91:07.63]Heroes never die.
[91:17.14]Firecrafts.
[91:18.80]Fire at will.
[91:24.50]I hope I got my, like, 5%.
[91:25.42]Did you ult?
[91:27.72]You got two people.
[91:29.22]Oh, I was just watching the whole time.
[91:31.04]I just... It didn't look like you ulted.
[91:35.26]I thought it looked like you were waiting for it.
[91:48.97]Sorry if I'm being a crybaby to everybody.
[91:53.03]The BabyRage.
[91:55.75]There's some flum said like two weeks ago when competitive came out he was saying that Just chats in general Ever since ranked came out was just being much more mean I was like man, you're totally wrong playing with you.
[92:12.98]Yeah, he was right Like everything you do now like before and quick play was like, oh this is fun now it's like you suck every second I
[92:26.14]I think I'm gonna go over to PTR and play some Ana, since they're all hacking it in.
[92:33.84]And then... I don't know.
[92:36.36]I wanna play some Ana.
[92:37.27]So hold on.
[92:49.69]Nice work!
[92:50.47]Here's the pay.
[92:54.86]Hello?
[92:56.08]Ronnie?
[92:56.70]Love you, baby.
[92:57.54]I know you do, Ronnie.
[93:01.40]Thanks, man.
[93:02.88]You're not bored of Ana yet?
[93:04.00]I want to main Ana.
[93:06.78]I want to main all the goofy supports.
[93:10.83]And play kind of like that weird role, if it's ever available.
[93:15.61]So hopefully we get some Ana going.
[93:25.11]You're not currently getting a 4k, you suck.
[93:27.03]Yeah!
[93:39.22]The plan is... Theoretically... Play Ana, Symmetra, and Zenyatta.
[93:48.18]If we need a support on the team.
[93:51.26]Especially with Zenyatta getting buffed.
[93:52.80]I don't know.
[93:53.22]It depends whether or not Zenyatta is actually good enough after he comes out of the PTR.
[93:57.40]Right now, he's insane.
[93:58.41]And I don't want to practice him right now, mostly because I don't want to practice an insane version of Zenyatta and get used to it.
[94:07.85]Play some Mei.
[94:08.75]Mei is kind of like a weird support, too.
[94:11.87]She fits into that odd role on the team.
[94:15.07]It depends.
[94:15.95]It's iffy.
[94:18.14]but I love me some Mei.
[94:19.80]And if I'm not playing that role and for some reason we need damage instead, I always got Pharah.
[94:25.14]And even Torbjörn I've been playing, who is kind of more like another just... weird out there kind of guy.
[94:37.53]That and projectile characters have always been my favorite.
[94:39.86]Zenyatta's projectile, Mei.
[94:42.06]Ana kind of is...
[94:47.06]But a lot of the groups that I play with in ranked usually anyway, I think Ana would work really, really well with them.
[94:54.17]I'm hoping that all pans out.
[95:04.50]The type of Pharah is Ana?
[95:05.82]It's Pharah's mom.
[95:12.11]They're both Amaris.
[95:20.45]What about Junkrat and his projectiles?
[95:21.81]I play him every now and again, but there's only a couple places where he's actually reliably good.
[95:26.98]Like, I'll play Junkrat nearly every time defense on Dorado, if it works out.
[95:34.42]But... Everywhere else, like, we had a Junkrat there on Hollywood, and Junkrat can be pretty good on Hollywood, but I'd just rather it would be Pharah.
[95:43.77]So, I think the amount of Pharah I play ruins how much Junkrat I want to play.
[96:06.67]Aw yeah, let's heal these 40s.
[96:11.11]49 is a rough spot to be in.
[96:13.18]No!
[96:15.70]Yes!
[96:18.40]You're my hero.
[96:19.22]Because when someone's like a 59, you call them a 50.
[96:26.63]When someone's a 49, you call them a 40.
[96:28.79]Even though they're just one point away from being a 50.
[96:31.29]No, you're a fucking 40, dude.
[96:44.50]Probably be playing Zenyatta otherwise.
[96:58.29]As much as I said I don't want to practice overpowered Zenyatta, I do want to practice the projectile speed, because I've always assumed that they're a lot faster than they actually are.
[97:07.33]Because Zenyatta orbs, they look a little bit like Mei icicles.
[97:12.21]A little bit, but my icicles move like three times faster.
[97:16.49]So I think I... I aim Zenyatta orbs really poorly.
[97:20.65]Honestly, I think... I kinda wanna test the projectile speeds.
[97:30.48]Maybe need three people to do that though.
[97:34.80]Me, myself, and another man.
[97:38.94]Two people.
[97:41.24]Zenyatta orbs feel slower than Pharah rockets even.
[97:43.80]I kind of want to like see exactly where they are though, so I know exactly what I'm doing.
[97:56.07]Oh yeah, we're in the land of the Divas.
[98:12.42]Eh, not worth.
[98:24.33]I could've stunned him.
[98:29.36]Nevermind.
[98:29.86]It's a lot more awkward now.
[98:50.79]I really want to fucking Ana boost that guy, but he's so far away.
[98:53.91]They hit it.
[99:03.96]No!
[99:04.66]This is not going well.
[99:10.46]You see Ana's clip increase from 6 to 8 being her big change?
[99:13.36]Yeah, it was something she really needed.
[99:28.08]I should be healing people more my bad.
[99:30.52]We don't have another support Get in there
[100:02.47]Someone?
[100:04.51]Okay.
[100:07.75]I don't know if Genji killed anyone and I don't know if anyone turned around and looked at him.
[100:17.12]That's one reason why I've been doing less healing.
[100:32.62]Sir, please read my donation, Papa.
[100:35.45]Hold on!
[100:37.09]She's gonna ult now?
[101:09.76]Oh, we got him, Tiger.
[101:18.32]Hold on.
[101:18.76]Okay, hold on.
[101:21.82]Wait, what?
[101:23.12]There is no such thing.
[101:24.66]There is no such message.
[101:26.46]Unless it was a really long time ago.
[101:28.10]Oh, she's eating Brit.
[101:31.84]That was a... That was a long time ago.
[101:36.10]I totally read that, just not out loud earlier.
[101:59.63]Well, I always miss that health kit when I'm turned around.
[102:06.38]On the 8th Tuesday of the secondary planetary alignment on the 4th century AD, can Ana headshot if a virgin sacrifice is also made?
[102:12.28]Also keep up the need of work.
[102:14.36]Gamer, dude, man, guy, star, B. Uh, no.
[102:19.31]I think we already figured out the one time where she can headshot, but I can't remember what it even was.
[102:25.46]Someone already got to you.
[102:28.38]Heh, like that.
[102:48.95]Okay, I, again, need to actually heal people.
[102:52.11]All the people.
[102:58.47]What the?
[103:02.57]I couldn't get a sight!
[103:23.85]I'm about to let D.Va go wild.
[103:28.03]That was an aggressive Bastion.
[103:44.92]I don't know if D.Va gone wild is what we needed.
[103:54.32]I don't think it is.
[104:01.09]Wow, that was wild.
[104:02.27]I know!
[104:02.77]I feel like if I didn't make D.Va go wild, though... We were going to lose in the same fashion that we did, just like 10 seconds sooner.
[104:10.89]Everyone dies.
[104:37.53]Ana kinda sucks, or is it just you?
[104:38.99]It's just you.
[104:39.71]She can't carry a team or anything.
[104:43.47]And you need someone that you trust with Ana boost.
[104:48.98]Pretty much you need a team.
[104:50.08]And I don't trust anyone.
[104:56.06]She also is a little bit weird as a solo support, but she can do it.
[104:59.04]But I'm also... I don't know.
[105:02.39]I don't really care.
[105:04.39]It's PTR, so what if we lose?
[105:12.27]Does Ana's thing that stops healing also stop healing from source that heals?
[105:18.88]Yes, it stops healing from sources that heal.
[105:27.74]I think there's a bug where it doesn't stop payload healing, but that's probably going to be fixed.
[105:34.71]I'd have to assume.
[105:52.39]We actually have
[106:20.04]Genji now, which will be nice to ult.
[106:28.71]Why am I up here?
[106:30.93]What am I doing?
[106:33.43]Why did I get away with it?
[106:54.80]We're going with the whole D.Va gone wild thing again.
[106:57.01]Again, I don't think it was worth making D.Va go wild.
[107:12.35]Oh my god, that actually rolled in the door.
[107:14.65]And the health kit was like a millisecond away from appearing so I didn't want to use my own health giver.
[107:20.02]I wasn't cut out for retirement anyways.
[107:49.66]Oh, we are on the point.
[108:00.38]Damn.
[108:01.08]There is no doubt in my mind there is a bug with scoping and with Ana.
[108:06.97]Someone please tell me I'm not crazy.
[108:12.47]And if it's not your first shot as Ana, when you pull the trigger and you scope in, sometimes it doesn't shoot.
[108:25.32]Yep, there absolutely is.
[108:30.90]I'm really hoping I'm not crazy and that's actually a bug and it actually gets fixed.
[108:38.43]I showed this on the other stream.
[108:39.61]But yeah, it's really annoying.
[108:43.25]I think it's because it's bolt action.
[108:55.80]That explains it.
[108:58.49]That explains how wildly inconsistent it is.
[109:23.96]Okay, this is our... Genji has ult.
[109:28.56]Go get him.
[109:35.46]Oh, the self-destruct!
[109:37.54]Sick.
[109:44.27]No, okay, look.
[109:47.80]Look how fast this first shot is.
[109:49.24]I'm going to go over this again because I want to be really clear on this.
[109:52.89]Because I really want to make sure this is a bug and if it is, it gets fixed.
[109:56.21]And if I'm not just crazy.
[109:57.97]The first time you scope in, you can fire that shot before you even scope.
[110:01.63]And you can tell that it's hit scan because it has the trail.
[110:04.04]Like how fast that's happening.
[110:06.48]It's happening before the scope even comes up.
[110:08.10]Can we agree on that?
[110:10.38]Do we have a yes-no situation here?
[110:17.68]Now when you, after you bolt action it, you have to wait a really long time.
[110:24.52]That didn't shoot.
[110:27.04]Bolt?
[110:28.44]Can't shoot.
[110:29.30]I clicked twice there.
[110:31.86]Bolt.
[110:40.28]Wait, wait, wait for the bolties.
[110:42.50]I don't, my team, whatever, fuck you guys.
[110:53.78]I'm gonna go into training after this match.
[110:55.92]I'm sorry.
[110:57.82]This needs to be explored Old soldiers
[111:34.95]Where are you boys going?
[111:36.61]Weapon accuracy 12%.
[111:37.91]No!
[111:38.77]Unscoped accuracy is 37!
[111:39.65]Sniper!
[111:40.16]Don't get caught!
[111:43.12]Let's get this payloader off the finish line!
[112:00.91]You're powered up!
[112:01.85]Get in there!
[112:11.97]Oh.
[112:12.13]Hi Reaper.
[112:22.08]You can scope in before she finishes her reload time?
[112:24.46]That's the problem though.
[112:25.62]We're gonna go into training and figure this out once and for all.
[112:39.41]It might just be that her actual reload animation... I'm gonna need, like, video slowdown and shit to figure this out.
[112:49.48]And, like, an on-screen button press for when I left-click.
[112:52.79]And a whole bunch of shit to, like, really prove it.
[112:57.01]And have anyone in the world believe me.
[113:09.77]Long time watcher.
[113:12.70]Give us the deets on the new YouTube videos you have planned?
[113:21.00]Oh, sick.
[113:21.28]I'm gonna play League of Legends now.
[113:48.60]Okay.
[114:18.45]I think we, uh, think we got him.
[114:24.65]I hope.
[114:40.67]No!
[114:42.41]If that was on cooldown up there, I would have put him to bed and no one would have known.
[114:46.46]No one would have woke him up.
[114:48.32]But I had to wait a whole three seconds of not dying.
[114:50.36]Damn.
[115:01.83]Okay.
[115:05.21]Brainy.
[115:06.71]Let's go.
[115:09.93]Let's figure this out.
[115:12.13]So figuring this out relies on people believing me when I say I press left click.
[115:15.85]Go try it yourself.
[115:16.69]Let's all Bob Ross this together and have a nice little sniper time.
[115:25.00]You're already hurt.
[115:25.74]Rip.
[115:30.68]Can't join a group while you're in training, man.
[115:32.31]It'd make me leave.
[115:33.89]So, the proposed problem is that if you scope in and shoot, you can do it really, really, really fast at the beginning with scope.
[115:44.35]Unless you've just fired a shot, so it might be a reload thing.
[115:47.46]So the first thing you want to know is what the reload animation looks like and as soon as you can shoot.
[115:52.84]And I think, actually, looking at that, it might be what I think is that you bolt it,
[115:59.16]But there's like a millisecond delay.
[116:01.32]Not a millisecond.
[116:03.57]But doesn't it look like after you fire a shot and after you're done bolting it, the next shot doesn't immediately fire, like you have to wait a second?
[116:11.77]Your gun kind of does sit still for about a second.
[116:14.37]I think that's what it is.
[116:18.19]No, even bringing it in there, I had to click twice to shoot that.
[116:20.75]Okay, don't click twice.
[116:30.43]I had to click twice there.
[116:36.71]Aim at a bot to make sure you're shooting.
[116:38.17]True.
[116:39.69]I was aiming at a darker corner so you can actually see the bullet trails.
[116:43.89]And tell whether or not they're a projectile.
[116:48.91]That didn't shoot.
[116:53.39]Didn't shoot.
[117:04.47]Didn't shoot.
[117:05.13]That one was definitely... Can we agree that that one was definitely done bolting?
[117:10.94]I scoped in while it was over.
[117:14.56]There was enough delay.
[117:15.56]I brought the scope up.
[117:17.18]It didn't shoot.
[117:28.62]Didn't shoot.
[117:36.03]The problem is that it's so powerful.
[117:42.17]The way you'd want to be playing on it if that didn't happen is that you can shoot before the scope is even up with that first shot.
[117:48.97]You can turn your bolt into hit scan immediately to the point where you don't even need the scope.
[117:58.44]But you have to wait two seconds after it's done reloading for you to be like, okay, now I can do it again.
[118:06.29]That's a pain in the ass.
[118:12.11]Put cam on mouse.
[118:13.01]Yeah, that way you'll know it's totally not like really blurry and impossible to tell what's going on.
[118:48.28]I don't know.
[118:48.78]It depends how you want to look at it.
[118:50.24]Whether or not it's a bug or like... They do that on purpose so that you can't do that that often.
[119:01.73]But it's definitely annoying.
[119:04.09]And if it doesn't get changed, I guess it's just something you have to keep in mind.
[119:11.57]Oh, look at this 50 on my team.
[119:29.13]Hello, I am Arcadum Roleplay.
[119:33.37]Arrgh, matey!
[119:34.03]You're doing a pirate.
[119:38.08]Arrgh, I am Arcadum.
[119:39.86]I am here to hold up my shield.
[119:43.27]What a fanboy.
[119:48.31]What Mcjimbo says is pretty much how I feel about it.
[119:50.83]It might not be a bug, but it's a bad feature because there's no clear reason why you wouldn't be able to fire.
[119:56.08]I shouldn't overstay my welcome.
[119:57.84]I'm probably still on the watch list here.
[120:04.14]Get back in the fight.
[120:13.36]Yeah, that's about how long you have to wait when in reality the actual fire rate.
[120:17.64]A lot faster than that.
[120:25.48]That one, yeah I clicked it didn't shoot.
[120:27.03]It totally should have.
[120:29.67]That one didn't shoot either.
[120:30.71]And I'm actually waiting longer than I think I have to wait on those.
[120:41.09]So I guess I'm done doing that, or at the very least, you can do it on the first one and then after that.
[120:50.11]You know what it might be?
[120:51.05]Never mind, I don't know what it might be.
[121:01.61]I think the coming out of scope animation for a second is what I was thinking of is what actually has a delay on it.
[121:16.44]Copying this gun makes projectile mod useless.
[121:18.32]Projectile is still useful because it's less obvious where you're coming from because it doesn't have a line pointing to where you are.
[121:25.13]I mean, you can follow the trail, but it's still a little bit harder to notice in a fight than like a Widowmaker thingy.
[121:32.57]Projectiles are easier for hitting close range targets.
[121:36.14]Because the projectiles are huge for hitting teammates.
[121:48.68]I'm being really awful.
[121:59.03]Okay, let's let's move past everything.
[122:01.15]We've just talked about in play game I
[122:20.49]projectiles on teammates are gigantic for when you try and shoot teammates
[122:56.17]Ronnie!
[122:57.87]You had to swing again!
[122:59.43]I am Superman!
[123:05.04]I thought after I put him to bed, Ronnie would swing at him, because I left him with like 10 health.
[123:21.63]Or after he got pulled.
[123:22.69]I didn't expect much from this 53 Ronnie.
[123:55.63]Oh god!
[123:56.43]I shouldn't have killed him!
[123:57.55]What a mistake!
[123:58.25]That's much better.
[124:07.00]Oh, he ran away.
[124:09.74]Let's Roadhog do his dirty work for him.
[124:11.30]Doesn't want to take the 1v1.
[124:12.78]Oh, McCree's just gonna walk away?
[124:14.74]I missed a flashbang!
[124:15.80]I can't hit someone who's able to move!
[124:18.54]Scaredy cat.
[124:19.79]I wasn't cut out for retirement anyways.
[124:40.74]Go, Ronnie, go!
[124:41.72]Go!
[124:42.28]You're powered up.
[124:44.44]Get in there.
[124:53.07]I think you got... I think you were in the middle of their full six-man team is the problem.
[124:57.67]Why did you do that?
[125:00.51]I... I believed in myself.
[125:04.65]I've come back from work.
[125:10.58]Range sniper behind the enemy team near their spawn complaining about McCree running away?
[125:13.95]That's why I'm complaining!
[125:16.13]Because I'm a sniper, and he's McCree, and he's running away from me!
[125:20.53]He's a coward!
[125:32.59]Also on his close range burst is actually pretty damn good.
[125:45.34]Oh, he's got that goofy thing on him.
[125:59.14]Go, Ronny, go!
[126:09.60]Ronnie is the guy, the Reinhardt who stands in the choke point and never goes forward.
[126:14.34]Doesn't matter how many people are dead.
[126:16.46]How shameful.
[126:37.63]No, if I killed him, I think that would have been play of the game as Ana.
[126:42.23]Because that would have been like a shutdown play.
[126:46.50]He just had to get freaking headshot by Widowmaker before I could stun him.
[126:49.86]Are you stream sniping me?
[127:03.08]yes I'm I'm watching to see your group make oh I'm gonna be Anna now criticize your zenyatta oh wait somebody already picked that I'm just doing talking to you man also sorry my throat is a bit hoarse today so I sound like regina
[127:34.78]Oh, defense.
[127:42.25]I gotta play Symmetra.
[127:45.95]Oh, nice three support team.
[127:55.17]Wow, I got to him.
[127:59.30]I got in his head.
[128:00.06]I got in his head!
[128:01.32]It wasn't even a bad choice and I got in his head!
[128:05.08]Get fucked, Ronnie.
[128:09.90]Symmetra is actually a really good choice, because we don't have a Mercy for revives.
[128:16.05]And Zenyatta in PTR isn't even a support.
[128:30.26]I got in your head again!
[128:35.57]Now you're questioning it!
[128:36.37]Ow.
[128:56.92]Pharah behind me!
[128:58.34]Pharah behind us!
[129:04.84]Where's the teleporter?
[129:05.84]This was supposed to be an honor stream, but there's one hero limit, man.
[129:23.39]And I wasn't fast enough.
[129:31.02]Oh god, they're all here.
[129:32.04]Oh, Jesus.
[129:38.02]Okay.
[129:48.80]The most significant buff to Zenyatta is the one no one ever talks about.
[129:52.09]Like, yeah, mainly 50 health.
[129:53.63]And his ult got better.
[129:57.47]This Reaper is really good at finding me.
[130:02.21]And by really good at finding me, I mean I shouldn't be in any of these positions I've been in.
[130:09.22]Because Zenyatta changed man, Discord orb actually instantly travels to people.
[130:14.58]Pretty much instantly.
[130:33.09]Oh.
[130:33.29]That was Ronnie's fault.
[130:35.03]That's dog noises behind me.
[130:36.64]I gotta pour myself some more peach tea.
[131:03.65]Personally, if you ask me, I like 150 health Zenyatta.
[131:14.72]Probably gonna bring it down to 175
[131:18.15]On Tuesday, I'd guess.
[131:21.54]If they're actually doing PTR patches the same time they do regular patches.
[131:25.52]My DPI button was set too high.
[131:28.85]That was it.
[131:29.91]Yeah, you'll fix it this time though.
[131:32.43]Oh yeah, it's gonna be real good.
[131:38.69]What the hell was I just saying?
[131:39.93]Oh yeah, I like low health Zenyatta.
[131:41.33]I think it makes him unique.
[131:43.69]Makes him fun to play, because when you do well on him you feel like, despite how squishy I am, I killed that person.
[131:49.37]Like, when you're 150 health Zenyatta and you kill a Tracer that tries to hunt you down, just like the one quick, like, headshot, two-tap, then it's kind of like, I fucking killed you!
[132:01.12]That was awesome!
[132:02.62]Now it's kind of like, yeah, that's expected, who cares.
[132:08.53]So I'd rather see him at 150 health and just buff some of his other stuff.
[132:11.91]Like the faster moving Discord is really nice.
[132:15.64]And his ultimate being able to be used as an escape with how fast it makes you go is really nice.
[132:20.66]Even though it looks stupid.
[132:26.98]And his healing being brought up on his ult.
[132:29.04]I think that was enough in my opinion.
[132:47.71]You you went too wild when you couldn't be healed that's what I'm gathering You and Lúcio too wild Take some damage man, I gotta build this
[133:26.22]We broke it down and no one walked in.
[133:53.78]You got trounced upon.
[133:54.72]Trampled, even.
[133:55.06]Oh, we have the triple support.
[133:56.04]To get hurt.
[133:58.64]Teleporter's in the top right window thingy.
[134:28.98]I didn't know it was going to be in that bad of a spot.
[134:30.62]Because if it was in that bad of a spot... Okay, now what?
[134:37.01]I'm confused.
[134:37.71]Ah, shit.
[134:38.47]I missed the last shot.
[134:40.53]They have another teleporter!
[134:59.19]Now, hold on.
[135:03.85]Okay, time to focus.
[135:05.53]I'm totally good at this video game.
[135:07.95]Ooh, okay.
[135:08.57]They have another teleporter.
[135:10.39]60 seconds remaining.
[135:17.02]I need healing.
[135:33.11]Everyone always says that it looks like Zen's rate of fire was slowed down when they watched me play Zenyatta, but that's because I actually take time to aim between my shots.
[135:40.94]It's not a nerf, it's just how I play Zen.
[135:46.00]Oh, you look tired.
[135:46.58]You're powered up, get in there.
[136:09.59]They're not calling out spammers.
[136:10.61]The headshots on Zenyatta are too important, and I feel like if I hold down the button, I'm gonna miss.
[136:43.81]You know, I go for the make sure I hit headshot, slow down my shots kind of style.
[136:51.27]If you can hit headshots by shooting at max speed, more power to you.
[136:56.87]I can't.
[136:58.68]Also, I usually play a lot of slower projectile classes.
[137:01.30]It just feels more natural to me.
[137:04.02]Never stop fighting for what you believe in.
[137:20.30]Is Ana plus Pharah a good combo?
[137:22.04]I think it's decent.
[137:25.09]Because a really fast moving Pharah is good.
[137:28.83]And a damage boosted Pharah is good.
[137:31.65]I suppose if you had a Mercy on your team, double damage boosting the Pharah would be insane.
[137:37.43]And the times that you want a Pharah is usually when she's being damage boosted by a Mercy anyway.
[137:44.08]So I could see that being pretty legit.
[137:47.54]Though on its own, damage, uh, adding nano, giving a nano boost to a Pharah is kind of like just playing Mercy for eight seconds.
[137:57.03]That seems a little bit wasteful on its own.
[138:01.75]Attackers incoming.
[138:04.59]Defend objective A.
[138:26.43]I should not have woken him up.
[138:27.81]If he was a smart Reaper man, he would have just killed me.
[138:34.51]If I was a good honor girl, I would have shot him at least once.
[138:37.34]I die, but I got tele when I get back.
[138:50.00]Get in there, Junkrat.
[138:54.60]I believe in you.
[139:18.64]Teleporter.
[139:19.50]Great job, Ronnie.
[139:20.24]Thanks, I tried really hard.
[139:23.25]I don't want to get one-tapped by Hanzo again, so I'm not peeking that.
[139:33.55]I'd rather stay alive and just heal boys.
[139:36.07]How does this Reaper keep getting there?
[139:47.62]I think he's just... I don't even think he went all the way around.
[139:50.75]Maybe he did.
[139:51.29]It seems like he's just coming in from the garage.
[140:00.15]Oh, this is a dangerous teleporter.
[140:08.25]I think he has been teleporting around, though.
[140:17.13]Oh, that's a dragon.
[140:18.57]Behind me.
[140:25.00]What a flanker.
[140:30.70]Give up on non-PTR?
[140:31.98]Nah, we, uh, the group that I was with split up.
[140:47.13]Sorry that was like really funny to me I think I'm the only one though
[141:30.39]He comp points to buy a golden Ana gun?
[141:32.13]I'll get it by the time she's released.
[141:33.65]And if I don't, then I'm going to play a ton of comp when she is released, and I'll get it that way.
[141:39.51]And even then, I'm still not even sure which golden weapon I want.
[141:52.65]I think for a sniper rifle being golden, it'll be kind of distracting on Ana.
[141:58.12]It's kind of a big view model.
[142:00.02]It might be way too shiny.
[142:02.88]I heard from NG that some of the 76 ones are actually a little bit too shiny that they're annoying.
[142:15.07]So I don't know.
[142:16.89]I might get Pharah or Mei still.
[142:27.59]Reaper's behind us.
[142:33.97]He's almost dead.
[142:37.20]McCree keeps creeping on the right.
[142:58.84]Oh shit.
[143:02.73]Go to bed.
[143:07.41]Zunyata's dead.
[143:14.69]He got back up immediately.
[143:18.47]There hasn't been anyone to boost.
[143:20.71]Like, even looking at my team comp, who am I gonna boost?
[143:31.58]Just gave it to D.Va so she could walk faster and get out there.
[143:43.91]What are you doing shielding?
[143:45.13]Why would he shield?
[143:49.29]There's one person on the point.
[143:52.78]Oh, I guess he... because he had no health.
[143:55.32]Anyway, never mind.
[143:58.00]Mystery solved.
[143:59.46]I'm not doing very well as Soldier, I'm just gonna go Reinhardt so you have something to boost.
[144:08.17]Stop stream sniping me, man.
[144:09.37]I'm not gonna boost you.
[144:11.13]Giving it to Zenyatta.
[144:13.52]That's fair enough.
[144:32.98]He was shielding because D.Va ulted.
[144:34.30]I didn't even see D.Va ult.
[144:36.12]Nevermind.
[144:36.76]Oh, can't be healed.
[144:46.41]Whoops.
[144:49.25]The effect of the grenade still persisted on her after that ended, which I wasn't sure of, so now I know that.
[144:54.19]Uh, Hanzo's on our bridge, man.
[145:02.51]They have been having a lot of flanker stuff.
[145:04.21]I think as Ana, I should be on the bridge and watching for that kind of stuff so I can stop flankers.
[145:10.63]This is why we're playing more of Run PTR, so we can learn these dumb mistakes.
[145:17.02]And little nuances.
[145:22.36]What?
[145:22.90]Who even are you?
[145:28.39]I've got you.
[145:46.58]What?
[145:49.04]What?
[145:49.32]15% healing, nice!
[145:50.20]Holy shit, D.Va?
[145:54.28]It must not have been D.Va the whole time.
[145:55.84]Maybe that was the Junkrat from rounds prior?
[145:58.10]Because 25% team damage on D.Va is concerning.
[146:04.55]Honest Grenade, nope.
[146:13.16]Doesn't affect Tracer recall.
[146:15.78]Destroyser's recall technically isn't a heal.
[146:24.87]And recalling... The logic behind it is that she recalls back to a point where she didn't have the grenade on her.
[146:45.13]Prepare your defenses
[147:14.68]Logic.
[147:18.36]Can you recall into negative effects, though?
[147:20.40]Nope.
[147:22.76]Because Tracer gets every possible advantage.
[147:25.43]That's just how the character is designed.
[147:28.93]Everything goes in Tracer's favor.
[147:31.87]Stick to the plan.
[147:33.17]And if you get into trouble, I'll bail you out.
[147:40.73]Can you recall, remove ammo from your Tracer guns?
[147:43.21]A little bit of a lore thing here.
[147:45.11]Tracer reloads her guns by recalling their ammo.
[147:54.92]So yeah.
[147:59.92]At least it appears to be the same technology in the guns as her recall.
[148:05.43]I'd say so.
[148:13.18]Greetings.
[148:14.48]They fixed Tracer recalling into the payload?
[148:23.76]I don't know.
[148:24.58]I think they said they fixed it once.
[148:28.02]But they didn't actually, so I don't know where that still happens.
[148:30.68]Watch out for Gengu!
[148:44.22]He's in the health.
[148:59.70]Yeah, chase that Frank.
[149:06.32]If Genji comes back up now I'm totally dead because I don't have either cooldown.
[149:14.64]Why do they care more about Tracer than any other character?
[149:17.04]It's the poster child, man!
[149:20.44]They had actually said that Tracer was kind of one of the few things that they brought over from when they were making Titan.
[149:31.47]A character similar to Tracer was also the poster child of that shit.
[149:34.59]I need a sightline on Rein!
[149:43.65]No!
[149:46.09]Oh, jeez, everybody stop dying.
[150:05.24]So, too long didn't rate Blizzard has a British waifu.
[150:07.92]Yeah, yes.
[150:08.66]That makes sense, right?
[150:16.50]Learn all characters from Titan?
[150:18.16]I mean... Nobody knows.
[150:27.13]That sucks.
[150:29.77]Alright, I think I'll be more useful as Lúcio.
[150:39.37]Because I suck.
[151:01.96]Why would you shoot him?!
[151:05.19]You piece of shit!
[151:06.65]What was your level?
[151:08.25]Now I can justify it, you little 58 motherfucker!
[151:16.36]doesn't know what the new character does noob you know just for that take this sniper wants my patootie
[151:48.85]I was so happy with actually hitting that Genji.
[152:00.51]That's too bad when it didn't matter.
[152:09.71]And it seemed like... He was on the ground for about a good two seconds before he got shot.
[152:16.30]It seemed like...
[152:21.97]Seemed like it was gonna work.
[152:24.37]Say seemed like again.
[152:25.17]Get back indeed.
[152:59.50]Oh, he doesn't even see that there's three people right next to us.
[153:09.03]I knew it was always a risk when I gave him that ult.
[153:20.08]Something about giving Reinhardt's nano boost really inspires them to use their ultimate on one person.
[153:27.88]Have you guys noticed that, or is that just me?
[153:31.77]I've played a lot of Ana.
[153:33.15]I guess I've had a lot of time to notice the phenomena.
[153:36.45]But I think it's real.
[153:50.07]Aw man, I don't got a sleeper.
[153:56.58]That's too bad.
[153:57.98]It's the adrenaline, sir.
[154:00.08]Pump him up.
[154:02.51]I thought that Reinhardt was going to do it, but like the last person left alive after his slaughter.
[154:06.65]He's like, you know what?
[154:08.51]You're a good old target.
[154:09.60]That was a bad drop.
[154:21.05]Ow.
[154:22.17]Oh yeah, they're still super buffed McCree.
[154:23.65]Not that it mattered there, but that just reminded me that they're still super buffed McCree on PTR.
[154:28.28]Think they'll ever reach 30 heroes in Overwatch?
[154:38.00]Probably.
[154:39.64]Might take like two years, though.
[154:42.40]Two or three.
[154:46.77]Payment for services rendered.
[154:47.99]Pleasure doing business.
[154:50.40]They have never been in denial that they plan on adding a lot more characters.
[154:57.04]I think their original stance was also actually that they were going to add a lot more, but they've learned how much that fucks with balance.
[155:04.07]They're probably going to be a little bit slower about it.
[155:07.03]One of the original interviews before Overwatch was even in beta, I think a paraphrased quote from Jeff Kaplan is him saying,
[155:21.63]Something about, yeah, we plan on adding more heroes, we can make them really quickly and we're good at it, or something like that.
[155:36.08]I think their stance on that has changed a bit.
[155:38.05]Anyway, JM Jesus with the five bucks, you should totally play around a comp playing as Torbjörn without using turrets, why?
[155:46.25]Hey, Ster.
[155:49.31]You should gimp yourself and lose more rank points.
[155:51.66]It's already stressful enough, man.
[156:18.48]Also, yeah, my team would probably kind of hate me.
[156:23.31]You'd like me though.
[156:26.61]It's certainly a trade-off.
[156:27.83]Wow, I missed you so many times.
[156:31.75]I was like, I heard the shots whizzing by me.
[156:43.47]You just were jumping in a straight line.
[156:45.23]I was confused.
[156:46.17]It's high noon.
[156:51.98]Draw.
[156:53.44]My ultimate is charging.
[156:56.80]Oh, god.
[156:57.22]We've got this.
[156:57.66]Don't let us down.
[156:58.36]What if it's like that?
[157:00.94]No, hold on.
[157:03.54]Roll back, Sterf.
[157:05.27]Go.
[157:06.85]I've got you in my throat.
[157:11.32]You think we're gonna see a lot of Mercy Zen with the Zen buff for comps and tourneys?
[157:14.86]If Zenyatta were to stay the way he is now, he'd be a must pick nearly every single game.
[157:19.95]But I don't want to talk about team comps and where Zen belongs and Ana belongs until we're actually certain where the balance is gonna land, because who knows at the end of PTR what Zenyatta's actually gonna look at.
[157:30.51]So I could give you all the advice now for, yeah, Zenyatta's gonna be on this fantasy team.
[158:12.35]What do you think is the least balanced part of Overwatch currently?
[158:27.59]It's hard to point the finger at any one thing.
[158:34.82]I guess if just one general aspect again to talk about the same thing is that the supports right now are not very well balanced.
[158:42.55]Prior to Ana, you really only had Lúcio and Mercy, and Lúcio and Mercy are just outstanding to the point where they are gonna be on every single team composition and just run double support.
[158:56.07]And now that Ana and Zenyatta are trying to be brought back into the fold, I think supports are just all over the place.
[159:02.93]And they're trying to be balanced because of it.
[159:05.63]Mercy's ultimate in PTR builds 30% slower, which kind of brings it down, where reviving isn't necessary.
[159:17.43]Isn't like a must-have, which is helpful.
[159:29.44]But also, I don't know, overtime was messed up.
[159:32.90]A lot of the stuff that was like broken and imbalanced kind of got fixed so far and they're working on it.
[159:42.19]Blizzard has been really good with their patches and everything that they've decided to work on.
[160:17.71]I should have just not done anything.
[160:20.06]The longer Widowmaker stood back there staring at me, the better.
[160:24.06]We're like pushing the cart.
[160:56.34]Walk the dog.
[161:00.96]The hell was that?
[161:04.92]What is all of this?
[161:22.47]Okay.
[161:29.33]Someone come wake up.
[161:30.29]Ronnie!
[161:32.25]I see you.
[161:32.67]I'm sorry.
[161:33.37]Don't you dare.
[161:36.03]I almost.
[161:36.89]So close.
[161:37.31]I was so close.
[161:41.15]The only reason I stood there and even watched Reinhardt, I knew he was going to wake up and kill us both.
[161:45.24]I don't know why Ronnie was there.
[161:49.12]Why?
[161:49.34]What?
[162:24.42]There's this sleeping Genji on the floor.
[162:26.26]I'm gonna Graviton him to wake him up.
[162:33.25]Most questionable Overwatch play I've ever seen.
[162:36.97]Ever.
[162:49.74]They are down a player.
[163:06.26]It's been that way this whole time.
[163:18.09]No, we lost the player first, and then we got ours back.
[163:20.91]No, we can't.
[163:23.25]It's been that way for at least like a minute and a half.
[163:30.34]I'm sorry, I just try and blame lag for all things.
[163:32.98]I did it because I'm bored.
[163:36.29]We blame boredom.
[163:58.39]RIP rank.
[163:59.09]Remember, PTR rank doesn't matter.
[164:01.27]Everyone's still forgetting that.
[164:26.12]I can understand the boredom.
[164:35.53]When I get into, uh... ...Beam Speaks.
[164:44.14]It's high noon.
[165:03.13]On PTR, how close am I to getting rolled up?
[165:05.88]282, I'm... 18 off?
[165:09.88]That took way too long in my head.
[165:11.04]For some reason I wanted to say 20 and just making myself not say 20.
[165:14.28]It took a lot of effort.
[165:25.49]We're going to get on and on PTR just to see how it looks and see if it's as annoying as it might be.
[165:39.42]That means me and Jerome are gonna play some different games today.
[165:42.28]Eh.
[165:50.36]Eh.
[166:08.74]I think it's time to impress you with my May.
[166:14.54]Good luck.
[166:15.21]Get to play the game.
[166:17.17]Yeah.
[166:20.17]Bye, Glass Palm.
[166:22.44]Later, Skater.
[166:30.51]never stop fighting for what you believe in oh by the way this is every single one of my I'm the big Ster wait what oh punch kid punch kid I love it here in the mountains I wish I could go look at my daughter that's the only one I don't have punch kid on because the daughter joke is better than the punch kid joke
[166:55.59]Look at my son.
[166:56.99]I love him and he punches.
[166:58.20]I'm wondering if Denzo's a talented swordsman.
[167:04.32]Yeah, he is.
[167:05.84]Pretty good.
[167:12.99]Oh, they did come up here.
[167:13.93]They were just really late.
[167:24.39]Wow.
[167:25.33]What is, what is doing, what is doing on?
[167:30.45]No one can kill each other!
[167:31.80]Are you kidding me?
[167:49.02]That Pharah shot me.
[167:51.18]How much time are we at?
[167:52.28]We are at 50 seconds into Nepal.
[167:55.22]That Pharah must have been shooting me for 40 seconds straight.
[168:24.17]Ouchies.
[168:30.82]Oh, this is gonna hit me, huh?
[168:35.08]Yeah, I knew it was coming for me.
[168:36.66]This is no one else.
[168:38.48]Only shoot at me.
[168:39.22]Reinhardt's frozen.
[168:58.94]That's helpful.
[169:01.44]Yeah, I'm glad I could be helped.
[169:24.43]I tried I tried to get us to go in it's just this was a bad time We all have those rough times in our lives Alright, we're gonna get this next round it's gonna be amazing amazing Oh
[170:04.17]Why don't you just play Cairne?
[170:07.75]I don't know the... Wait, yeah, I know, right?
[170:11.72]He was, like, gonna argue with me.
[170:17.02]Thought about it.
[170:18.94]Alright, I'm on Pharah, dude.
[170:24.15]She's a threat.
[170:26.83]I love to icicle Pharah.
[170:28.51]I'm gonna kill your daughter!
[170:33.03]Okay, I would appreciate that.
[170:34.75]It's been a nuisance.
[170:49.40]Scared her out of the air at least.
[170:53.69]No mercy!
[170:57.73]Sorry, working again.
[171:07.76]Do we have another support?
[171:08.88]No, we do.
[171:09.50]Kind of.
[171:09.84]Anyone have ults?
[171:14.99]Just me.
[171:43.70]I trust him, man.
[171:49.99]Goddamn grenade.
[172:04.38]Goddamn concussion grenade!
[172:13.05]You know what's funny, if Star was playing Widowmaker he wouldn't have to heal his team because the enemy would all be dead.
[172:21.98]It feels like that right now actually.
[172:23.78]If you think about it that way.
[172:26.42]I've had a lot of good sniping opportunities.
[172:42.08]Yeah, I might... I might, uh, play a damage-dealing character after this, just so we can get to the point.
[173:01.11]Here, go get him.
[173:03.83]Go get him, Junkrat.
[173:06.31]By which, I mean... I mean, they're right here.
[173:08.99]You're dead.
[173:45.11]Okay, we got to the point.
[173:53.31]And Winston went in alone.
[174:05.99]Ow.
[174:08.21]And he left the team, okay.
[174:12.53]And he came back, okay.
[174:15.65]Please don't do that to me.
[174:51.45]Hey Hardcore I Don't know if Jerma's trying to get a rise out of me, but you know how a Jerma is always late He's texting me that he will be late look at my son I Love him
[175:19.45]Ouchies.
[175:59.00]It was a... It was a pretty fun chat.
[176:11.73]I wanted to shoot me some Pharahs, anywho.
[176:18.59]Someone's gotta...
[176:34.50]Aw, she didn't die.
[176:36.43]Oh no!
[176:57.47]I wanted a winning game.
[177:02.53]At least one.
[177:03.23]Hello?
[177:28.48]They switched off Pharah... That's what always happens!
[177:40.27]You like, play Pharah, you like, counter their character, and then they switch?
[177:44.89]How come Pharah can't be the class that no one switches off of so I can just fight them all the time?
[177:50.69]Why's it gotta be like... Ow, I'm dead.
[177:53.97]Why can't it be like, instead of Hanzo and Genji, no one just always plays Pharah?
[178:02.95]Honestly, real nice to see Pharah after a day or two.
[178:04.95]I played Pharah mostly this morning, because we were doing regular ranked.
[178:10.50]Actually, shit, does my title still say ranked?
[178:12.48]I should probably change that.
[178:34.50]Just play the character you're good at, Winston.
[178:50.03]I'm just gonna change the title completely too because Jerma lied to me and isn't gonna show up when he said he was going to.
[179:02.37]Four minutes until Jerma height.
[179:03.89]Good job.
[179:05.25]That's our monkey.
[179:07.19]Oh shit.
[179:42.19]What's his excuse going to be this time?
[179:43.71]He said he's hungry.
[179:45.73]But he's going out to eat.
[179:53.82]I just wanted to win at least one round there.
[179:57.54]It didn't pan out that way.
[180:00.38]That's too bad.
[180:20.33]I'm going to sacrifice myself so you can get better teams.
[180:28.94]I see you.
[180:29.86]What?
[180:31.12]Wait, no, no, no, no.
[180:32.48]I'm still going to get shit teams.
[180:36.61]Alright.
[180:37.25]Everybody, I solo-queued the first one.
[180:40.53]Everyone on PTR right now is just like 50s and... You fit right in, don't worry.
[180:46.01]That's good.
[180:59.42]See?
[180:59.74]The other team is like your rank.
[181:04.47]I swear to God I'm not this bad.
[181:06.47]I must be having a bad day, I swear.
[181:16.12]You're no Arcadum.
[181:17.72]You're just a wannabe.
[181:20.93]I do wanna be.
[181:31.93]Chad is gonna love that.
[181:37.46]Whoa, chat, Ster is not bullying.
[181:40.14]He is being the nicest guy ever.
[181:42.86]Butthole, who's that?
[181:44.83]Imposed 47, you're a butthole.
[181:47.29]Got him.
[181:49.09]Got him.
[181:50.27]Five, four, three.
[182:08.14]On again, boring stream.
[182:10.52]Yep.
[182:10.90]Rip stream.
[182:18.35]Guy's playing the newest content.
[182:40.56]Used to be a boring stream because of how much I played Pharah.
[182:44.79]Now Pharah is a nice change of pace.
[182:48.13]Guy patronizing me standing still.
[182:51.83]I gave him a butt injection.
[183:09.43]When do you think it is correct to pick Ana when she isn't new?
[183:14.33]We just spam her all the time, of course, which calms maps.
[183:17.91]Still not sure.
[183:18.47]I haven't had a chance to play her in serious, high-ranked, people-care-about-winning types of games.
[183:24.50]I think she can be good most of the time, but I'm still just waiting until she's actually released to figure all that out.
[183:43.68]I mean, you're gonna want a Genji on your team.
[183:46.10]I think most maps she's good.
[183:48.20]Some King of the Hill maps where you don't have good sniper sightlines, obviously she falls a little flat.
[183:54.82]And then you definitely want to rather have a Lúcio, and Lúcio can build a team on his own.
[184:00.99]I don't think she's gonna be very popular in King of the Hill.
[184:03.67]Everywhere else, though, she seems equally viable.
[184:13.42]That was the weirdest Pharah falling animation.
[184:22.62]Damn.
[184:23.98]Pass into the Iris.
[184:44.09]The more tanks you have on your team, the better.
[184:47.97]But usually you have Reinhardt, so... Oh, it's Wizards.
[185:04.63]I forget what team he plays on.
[185:08.03]But he plays on a team.
[185:09.65]As a tank.
[185:10.81]So I guess he's practicing D.Va.
[185:16.80]The only problem I have with Ana's soul healing is that she doesn't have a good support ult like a revive or Lúcio or...
[185:44.83]Ah, shit.
[185:45.69]I didn't have the ability to heal Canceler.
[185:48.17]Zenyatta ults so good.
[185:55.90]Oh, and also they have a Pharah.
[186:03.50]I'm probably gonna play Pharah next round.
[186:08.07]Just cause.
[186:14.31]Score, zero to one.
[186:15.95]Why?
[186:16.82]One hundred and three stages, and the game is basically over.
[186:37.11]Hanzo, at your service.
[186:47.34]Why do people keep asking that every time I try and explain that I want Ana to be like one of my main characters?
[187:07.50]It's probably because there's a whole bunch of different people in chat and they haven't heard me say it yet.
[187:12.66]But that's too logical, and I don't want to hear it.
[187:27.98]Guys, some goddamn logic.
[187:34.16]Oh, hi.
[187:34.48]That was a really nice shot.
[187:38.22]What with it being a headshot and all.
[187:39.76]I think it was a headshot.
[187:40.84]Must have been.
[187:50.26]Why do you want her to be your main?
[187:54.98]You ever have this thing happen where you like to play the characters that you enjoy?
[187:59.60]That's what it is.
[188:01.40]I might enjoy Ana.
[188:17.13]I think I'm leaving.
[188:19.29]It won't let me leave his group.
[188:22.07]Wait, you enjoy her?
[188:35.08]Why do you enjoy playing Ana?
[188:54.97]one friend.
[189:26.33]God damn video enjoyer.
[189:28.03]Yeah, I hate when people like the thing I make
[189:58.01]Because it's like, I'm not making the thing for you, you know?
[190:01.54]I'm making it for, like, popularity, but not enjoyment.
[190:05.82]What are you talking about?
[190:06.76]I have no idea.
[190:09.10]I feel like you're responding to something that I didn't see 30 seconds ago.
[190:16.28]Because you're seeing chat that's delayed.
[190:20.34]And I don't even know what you're talking about.
[190:21.89]Yeah, I'm just going to close chat.
[190:28.35]Ha!
[190:28.99]My best hat said something funny.
[190:32.35]No, he didn't.
[190:41.86]No, he really didn't.
[190:42.94]No, I was just picking out... I like the name, My Best Hat, though.
[190:46.12]I guess I don't like the name.
[190:50.64]I like the reference.
[190:52.56]To the thing that is something I like.
[191:02.25]Never stop fighting for what you believe in.
[191:06.87]I will strike our enemies where they do not expect.
[191:14.57]Hey, Wong.
[191:22.59]What?
[191:23.35]What?
[191:23.95]What was, uh, who's in top 8?
[191:27.83]I have no idea, I kinda, well it ended last night and I don't know, like the brackets are very confusing.
[191:33.94]I have no idea, like I've read, like I've read plenty of brackets but like there's like 5,000 people and I don't know how I found out.
[191:39.78]I heard that like everybody that everyone would want to see in top 8 didn't make it, like Daigo and Justin Wong and Umochi all got eliminated.
[191:52.12]Yeah, Wong knocked out Daigo, and Wong was in Losers, so he might have already got knocked out.
[191:56.96]Yeah, I heard he got knocked out.
[191:58.16]That's all I know, though.
[191:58.86]I don't know who's actually in Top 8.
[192:00.48]Who knows who's in Top 8?
[192:03.44]Now you gotta open up chat.
[192:07.21]Otherwise, you'll never know.
[192:10.01]Street Fighter, man.
[192:10.71]Alright, chat.
[192:11.23]Tell us who...
[192:27.88]And that bracket seemed to be working correctly.
[192:29.68]God!
[192:30.32]You're useless.
[192:35.00]Hold up now.
[192:38.60]Locking down the objective.
[192:42.64]It's John Cena.
[192:45.44]It's just a scratch.
[192:46.50]You'll be fine.
[192:47.02]Experience tranquility.
[192:49.15]Wait, what?
[192:51.35]Oh, infiltration.
[192:52.19]Alright.
[192:55.19]No power down.
[192:55.95]Get in there.
[193:00.13]This is a little bit of a disaster.
[193:01.65]I don't know.
[193:07.75]I guess I'll just wait and see who's in there.
[193:11.78]I could root for her.
[193:15.00]I don't like infiltration.
[193:16.08]I beat up my mom.
[193:37.04]You know it's probably better for Ana to go in the area where she can actually snipe with a sightline Rather than getting every time someone turns that corner.
[193:46.09]I'm just like oh shit.
[193:47.39]There's someone in my face This is bad for me
[193:56.39]Hey, how about Smash?
[193:58.53]Aren't you interested in Smash Top 8?
[194:04.14]No.
[194:08.64]But it's such a great fighting game.
[194:11.26]Like how they'll punch the guy a million miles off the map and then he comes back and chat's gonna get mad at me.
[194:18.06]You just gotta start the Smash arguments in chat.
[194:24.71]I heard that's just a party game.
[194:31.44]Like, when you have to turn off all the options in order to make it competitive, just stop trying to play a competitive party game.
[194:43.06]Are the pros in Smash just not good enough to use the items, or what?
[194:47.42]Yeah, it's too much, like, too high of a skill ceiling.
[194:54.22]They really want to keep it there.
[195:12.53]There's only like a hundred or so different weapons.
[195:14.65]There's more cards than that in Hearthstone.
[195:16.27]If Hearthstone pros can like learn all the cards, I'm sure they can learn all the items.
[195:32.78]Oh, that is bad time to... bad time to not be able to heal.
[195:58.40]I like warned the chat I was attempting to trigger them and they're being triggered.
[196:05.11]They're like trying to explain to me why items are turned off.
[196:14.67]Oh shit.
[196:17.60]Well, ask them why it's full of characters nobody's ever heard of, like Lucario.
[196:22.09]Yeah, what the fuck's a Lucario?
[196:26.37]Honestly, they should just play, um, PlayStation All-Stars.
[196:29.45]Because I've actually heard of those characters.
[196:31.29]They're more recent.
[196:33.05]Yeah, it's got, like, Cole and Nathan.
[196:41.89]The God of War.
[196:45.75]Kratos, yeah.
[196:53.59]I don't think, uh, I don't think we're winning this one either.
[196:57.08]Luke Mario?
[196:57.42]Mewtwo isn't even a Pokémon, why would they put him in a game?
[197:27.49]Payment for services rendered.
[197:28.69]Pleasure doing business.
[197:32.25]Ana's still screaming.
[197:35.85]Hey, just some support because I think you're a KLD big fan.
[197:49.24]I forget because I actually stream.
[197:51.59]I killed their whole team.
[198:04.96]That's why they put the Smash finals yesterday.
[198:07.12]Because no one wanted to watch them.
[198:10.34]They're like, let's get this garbage out of the way.
[198:12.70]I don't even care if you're Trigger Chat.
[198:15.50]Smash sucks.
[198:18.89]That was the real brutal honesty there.
[198:21.75]God damn.
[198:33.42]Oh, you know what else?
[198:34.32]Witcher sucks.
[198:38.10]Is Witcher in Smash?
[198:40.78]It would make the game worse.
[198:56.72]Oh shit, he got, he got Ana healed.
[199:22.32]Smash Finals are today.
[199:23.42]You just gotta correct me.
[199:28.16]Smash Finals were yesterday, dude.
[199:29.58]The one that matters.
[199:30.40]It's the new one.
[199:31.08]I'm gonna have to shoot you down.
[199:47.79]Move back.
[199:49.45]I'll respawn you.
[199:49.82]Hey!
[199:49.90]Come here if you're dead.
[200:12.30]It's like your bodies can't take this.
[200:14.72]I have to.
[200:15.72]My video game's best game.
[200:18.61]Video games are a religion.
[200:21.31]And I'm insulting someone's religion right now.
[200:38.91]I think.
[200:44.51]You know what's really embarrassing actually, now for reals?
[200:49.42]That they split The Witcher up into two games as a cash grab.
[200:54.32]Like remember when H1Z1 split into two games and everyone hated that and then The Witcher did it?
[200:59.55]And everyone was like, oh I love this, oh CD Projekt Red, suck my dick.
[201:12.39]You're ruining, you're ruining the trigger chat moments.
[201:15.78]Don't!
[201:16.56]Play along!
[201:26.94]The witchers.
[201:30.03]They just took Gwent out of The Witcher and told you to buy it again.
[201:36.07]Open OH-1-0 and don't do that!
[201:39.77]I love you CD Projekt!
[201:45.90]Anyone who was a Gwent fan already had The Witcher!
[201:48.72]I started this as a joke, but you know what?
[202:03.09]Now the more that I'm saying it, the more I'm believing myself.
[202:05.93]It kinda is the same thing.
[202:37.64]Oh, that Lúcio took like no damage.
[202:39.60]Am I okay?
[202:40.20]Yeah.
[202:40.52]I'm having a lot of fun now.
[202:44.24]Having a blast, having a blast.
[202:46.00]Having a blast, having a blast.
[202:47.74]You agree, right?
[202:49.66]Oh, wait.
[202:49.86]Yes, absolutely.
[202:50.88]Wait, no.
[202:51.34]Shut up.
[202:51.68]Not you.
[202:52.16]Hold on.
[202:57.48]Dermot, tell us about The Witcher 3.
[202:58.64]Tell us about what?
[203:01.10]Tell us about The Witcher 3.
[203:04.98]Should I be?
[203:05.78]Yeah.
[203:08.84]Yay or nay?
[203:11.86]I haven't played it, so... Come on!
[203:13.54]Okay, everybody in your chat is yelling, JARU!
[203:18.11]Ah, well... I heard it's very blood and wine-y.
[203:29.62]Okay, if they were going to make that many DLCs, is that like to cover up like that it was an incomplete game?
[203:38.14]Ow, you just made my neck hurt.
[203:40.34]I think you just missed my Gwent rant.
[203:42.56]I was, I had a really good, I was on to something.
[203:45.24]Wait, is Gwent out?
[203:46.72]No.
[203:47.94]They wouldn't show it at E3 because it's unfinished and they don't want people to know it's bad.
[203:51.34]Oh, didn't show it, must be bad.
[203:53.94]Like, no, where's the gameplay?
[203:55.02]Was it behind a wall?
[203:56.72]Was it behind a wall like every other game at E3?
[203:59.52]You were there.
[204:02.56]I didn't go see Gwent.
[204:03.94]Yeah, because no one did.
[204:06.14]Oh, jeez.
[204:09.99]Nice, I saw you just pump that guy off.
[204:12.63]Get pumped.
[204:19.35]Hi, guys.
[204:20.51]How's it going?
[204:21.53]Good.
[204:24.71]Yo, is this PTR?
[204:27.19]Yo, PTR.
[204:27.91]Nice.
[204:37.77]Wow, that tray shouldn't even get hurt.
[204:41.03]How do you truly feel about Ana?
[204:43.57]After the time playing with her?
[204:45.67]She's pretty good.
[204:47.29]I just don't know where she fits on a team quite yet.
[204:49.29]You have a lot of really good cards.
[204:52.60]What am I going to take out of my deck to fit Ana in when I already have a perfect 30 card deck?
[205:01.14]Yeah, you gotta get rid of your Knife Juggler at some point.
[205:04.06]I know, that's the problem.
[205:04.84]It's like, I already have a Knife Juggler.
[205:06.59]Like, why do I need Ana?
[205:10.29]That went really far.
[205:12.45]I mean, I already have this Mercy Lúcio.
[205:14.83]Like, the Ana Legendary just doesn't make any sense.
[205:18.10]Yeah, you have your Knife Juggler into Muster.
[205:21.66]How am I gonna take that out?
[205:27.37]I don't know.
[205:28.09]They're also nerfing Mercy, so stuff's gonna change a lot.
[205:39.28]Are we still on?
[205:42.22]Yeah.
[205:42.96]Oh, are we still on, he says.
[205:45.24]Let me get scheduled.
[205:47.08]Let me get SCHEDULATED here.
[205:57.92]I'm assuming this round is gonna go another at least a couple minutes.
[206:04.73]Just play another one after this.
[206:06.27]Okay.
[206:07.15]I mean that's fine.
[206:07.91]I mean 2 p.m.
[206:08.93]We can start at 3.
[206:11.88]I wanted to start at four anyway, so.
[206:15.65]My original was four, was it not?
[206:17.65]I was like, well, I wanted to start at four.
[206:19.75]Okay, so when I negotiated you down from four, you were just bullshitting me.
[206:24.09]When you negotiated me down from four, I was just like, it's still going to happen at four.
[206:30.90]I guess I'll say two.
[206:32.14]That'll, like, lessen the blow.
[206:35.22]I tried to bring it down to 1pm and you were like, nah, he'll be too mad if it's at 1.
[206:47.77]Those didn't hit anyone.
[206:49.59]I thought your title said PTR stuff with like a high heel.
[206:53.99]Oh, that's a banana.
[206:55.13]No, that's a banana.
[206:56.97]I glanced up, I was like, is that like a shoe?
[206:59.21]No, it's a banana.
[207:00.53]They attached bananas, so I put it in there.
[207:07.10]Oh yeah, I'm just gonna get ready.
[207:09.50]I'll just play another game and I'll see you in a few minutes.
[207:12.44]I'm dead.
[207:13.00]Shoe is greater than banana.
[207:38.29]Gotta say, from my perspective, I didn't feel like a defeat again, but that's okay.
[207:41.43]I'm having fun.
[207:43.58]Not too serious.
[207:46.18]Shit talk went somewhere.
[207:47.24]I don't know, what's in the- Jerma, are you there?
[207:51.02]What's another thing that people, like, really, really enjoy?
[208:13.48]Oh yeah, okay, sure.
[208:30.29]Nah, there's certain things that people have latched onto that you're not allowed to disagree with.
[208:36.50]Like The Witcher is one of them.
[208:43.47]You can't say bad things about The Witcher.
[208:45.45]Like, you CAN say bad things about Dota and people will just be like... Also, you can't bring up Smash.
[208:55.57]That's why we did that.
[209:01.31]Dark Souls 2 is the best Dark Souls.
[209:10.83]Mostly because Dark Souls 1 was like an amateur indie game.
[209:26.45]Undertale.
[209:29.35]If I wanted to play Undertale, I'd like...
[209:39.83]My grandfather had, like, five Nintendos.
[209:43.81]Just go play fucking Duck Hunt.
[209:50.84]Yeah, maybe it'd be an okay game if it was made, like, 20 years ago.
[209:53.46]That's all I have to say about that.
[210:20.66]There aren't too many of them anymore.
[210:22.02]I mean, Witcher was the big one for a while.
[210:23.76]And Dark Souls, people used to get more mad about that.
[210:26.68]But I think everyone's moved on a bit.
[210:28.93]From the Dark Souls circle jerking.
[210:30.43]It's been a while.
[210:35.21]Everything else is like, yeah, who cares, whatever.
[210:37.37]You know what band I really love?
[210:38.65]Studio Group.
[210:41.62]I love Studio Group.
[210:46.12]They did that great cover of Space Jam.
[210:48.96]Oh my god.
[210:52.82]Oh, and um... What's it called?
[210:58.02]It's like kids bop for adults, like idiot bop.
[211:05.95]The one that we legitimately always rant about.
[211:11.11]What the hell is it called?
[211:11.99]Why can't I think of the name?
[211:12.87]I don't even want to start it again.
[211:17.42]I'm just gonna say the name and leave it there.
[211:18.90]Uh...
[211:22.29]The shitty burgers.
[211:25.13]In and out.
[211:26.63]Just in and out.
[211:27.41]Just fucking in and out.
[211:29.67]Not starting this topic again.
[211:30.99]Because that's too true.
[211:35.32]And people can't handle that one.
[211:37.16]You think you're a good ferret, you need to watch this play.
[211:39.42]It's going to be amazing.
[211:42.38]I'll be healing you, doctor.
[211:47.53]Wait, I'm a doctor now?
[211:48.67]Oh man, finally.
[211:53.07]Get these chairs out of here.
[211:54.87]Okay, how do I make the Pharah go super high?
[211:57.29]Like, whoo!
[212:08.57]Oh, they re- By the way, everyone, if you didn't notice, they removed this bush in the PTR.
[212:13.42]Because people were putting Symmetra Turrets in here, and the bushes were blocking so many shots, it was unreasonable, so they got rid of the bush.
[212:26.86]Get behind this guy.
[212:35.10]Get behind PonchoJomp.
[212:38.61]Is that Reinhardt's name one of your comics?
[212:44.85]Uh... PonchoJomp.
[212:47.19]No, never heard of him.
[212:51.60]Sounds like it'd be your brother.
[212:53.76]You got Whomp and Poncho Jump.
[212:57.10]No?
[212:57.36]I guess he doesn't like Poncho Jump.
[213:08.59]Never mind.
[213:12.83]Never mind.
[213:24.96]Whoops.
[213:26.04]That's a rocket barrage.
[213:29.08]Good job, Ronnie.
[213:30.78]Thanks.
[213:31.72]No problem.
[213:32.82]There was an invisible guy.
[213:37.60]It's okay.
[213:38.84]He's dead.
[213:43.45]Weird as hell without three.
[213:45.23]It looks very non-symmetrical, which is funny again because it was nerfed.
[213:51.75]The bush was taken out because of Symmetra.
[214:11.58]Die, trust this Mei.
[214:14.26]Aw, I'm so dead.
[214:19.75]Oh, Tracer recalled really far away, I guess.
[214:39.69]We're into the most dangerous situations.
[214:41.81]Oh, also there was a turret up there.
[214:43.21]I didn't even realize.
[214:44.00]Look, because there's a bush there and a bush... And that's not in the middle?
[214:52.54]That is... Symmetra's triggered.
[214:54.96]Air shot.
[215:11.98]That's when Ana gameplay is like, holy, oh, PogChamp, you see that?
[215:16.46]That was a sick play, man.
[215:28.96]No one cares.
[215:39.89]I think I would have died if I didn't sleep that Roadhog.
[215:51.80]I think I'm probably going to die anyway.
[216:08.60]Actually holding the first point, I just realized that.
[216:11.92]Hold on.
[216:12.56]Pharah's coming.
[216:32.73]Jesus, did you get Gold Elims?
[216:35.75]Uh, I don't know.
[216:38.43]switching sides prepare to attack
[217:08.82]Starry Shields after Ana shoots her, does she block the poison damage over time?
[217:13.12]I have been told conflicting reports on this.
[217:17.00]I was curious about this myself.
[217:19.36]I think she blocks the poison.
[217:23.29]I think people were confused about what I was talking about last time I brought it up.
[217:26.49]But I'm pretty sure she should be stopping the extra damage.
[217:35.27]I don't work for Blizzard.
[217:36.39]Who's telling you I work for Blizzard and who's gullible enough to believe it?
[217:41.69]Yeah, I made this game.
[217:45.11]I'm just gonna say yes.
[217:51.47]That's why I can confirm for you, right now, the next hero is a sandwich.
[217:56.83]Thank you.
[217:58.37]Hello.
[218:01.87]Everyone dies.
[218:03.53]Everyone dies.
[218:04.68]Heroes never die.
[218:05.72]Yeah, sorry, I forgot to reveal that I have equity in Blizzard.
[218:09.78]I actually own half of Blizzard Entertainment.
[218:16.14]My bad.
[218:42.90]I was not ready for that Zarya to wake him up.
[218:46.98]I think he's still behind us.
[218:55.78]Yes!
[218:57.02]Zarya just gave up.
[218:59.43]He's still behind- No, Mercy!
[219:05.75]No!
[219:07.09]That's Roadhog's Den!
[219:18.47]It's pretty hard to hit Roadhogs who are actually looking at you with that ult.
[219:21.77]The way it pushes you around, and they usually walk kind of weird.
[219:25.20]Ow.
[219:28.72]Shot in the head.
[219:42.71]Don't worry, there's a Roadhog behind me.
[219:48.42]No, it's mostly just this Reaper.
[219:51.64]The Roadhog is super overextended.
[219:53.14]Not a joke this time.
[219:54.20]Um... I know.
[219:56.92]I made him fall asleep in the very beginning of the game.
[219:59.86]Zarya woke him up.
[220:02.03]Chased after him.
[220:03.01]Gave up on it.
[220:05.61]And he's been back there ever since.
[220:06.79]Take cover!
[220:15.73]You're powered up, get in there!
[220:18.18]Oh, done.
[220:18.60]My ultimate is ready.
[220:20.56]Pass into the iris.
[220:50.08]Oh, oh, oh yeah, that's all we had to do.
[221:01.73]I forgot.
[221:16.23]If Poncho Jump would have looked to the side there, he actually would have killed Roadhog.
[221:20.88]It says you have more range when you look to the side because it's a rectangular hitbox.
[221:30.48]Jerma ditched you?
[221:31.18]Yeah, I know.
[221:34.63]He already explained how he's trying to sabotage our friend date.
[221:58.48]Oh, I had an idea yesterday.
[222:00.26]A crazy idea.
[222:03.19]And I want to let this publicly be known right now, so that perhaps one day people could reference back to this and say, you know what, Ster was right the whole time.
[222:13.19]Overwatch is going to have some sort of game mode that in some way utilizes the physics of a sports ball.
[222:28.70]I don't know what it's going to be.
[222:29.54]But I'm calling it.
[222:34.84]I've seen the hints.
[222:37.36]Maybe they'll call it Pastime.
[222:40.22]Maybe they'll call it Rocket League.
[222:42.75]Maybe they'll call it, put bumper cars in.
[222:46.93]But they're fucking obsessed with the basketball physics in Spawn.
[222:51.97]And whether or not it's client-side or...
[222:55.28]server side and like getting it properly running so that everyone can see the basketball.
[223:01.68]Too much.
[223:02.18]They're too obsessed with it.
[223:03.81]There's gonna be a basketball game mode.
[223:05.69]Calling it.
[223:08.11]I don't care if this takes like three years.
[223:13.34]Four years.
[223:13.96]Five years down the road someone's gonna tell me I was right.
[223:42.56]I actually played Rocket League, like, all day yesterday.
[223:44.64]It was kind of fun.
[223:45.88]I haven't played it in a long time.
[223:49.15]I just had, like, Evo on a monitor.
[223:56.73]Rocket League on the other.
[223:57.51]Holy shit, PTR, we dropped out.
[224:00.02]What?
[224:00.24]I was just 70.
[224:01.24]We lost, like, three ranks for that.
[224:02.46]That's kind of funny.
[224:06.88]I kind of want to see how low I can go on PTR.
[224:10.37]But at the same time, I would actually like to unlock that Ana gun.
[224:16.50]Wait, didn't we win the last game?
[224:21.28]Who knows.
[224:28.27]Never stop fighting for what you believe in.
[224:33.43]Oh, and it was just like Overwatch.
[224:35.77]I had to do my placement matches for Rocket League because they reset the seasons and I haven't played since then.
[224:41.22]I won 8 out of 10.
[224:44.88]Got placed as a gray.
[224:47.18]A little gray boy.
[224:52.51]I'm forever destined to get screwed by placements.
[225:09.37]I don't care.
[225:10.01]Oh, shit.
[225:10.67]Roadhog.
[225:40.23]I got your back.
[225:41.69]Everyone's hurt.
[225:43.69]Torbjörn can't animation cancel anymore on GTR.
[225:50.61]Just from hearing you hit it, I think he does.
[225:53.25]Which is great.
[225:53.99]Just buff Torbjörn.
[226:12.29]You really need this.
[226:13.95]I wanted that.
[226:34.67]I'll make sure you get the next one.
[226:41.21]I gave him a nano boost just so he could do that.
[226:44.33]Lock the dog.
[226:49.81]I've got you in my sights.
[227:05.21]Did I have nano first?
[227:06.29]I didn't even notice.
[227:07.51]No, no, he didn't.
[227:09.55]I gave it to the Roadhog.
[227:10.29]I'm sorry, I gotta stop listening to stream.
[227:17.11]Not everything is about you.
[227:19.20]I know, right?
[227:24.20]I don't actually know where to hold this Ana on this point.
[227:26.20]It always feels really awkward.
[227:27.42]I should probably just be on the gas station healing teammates.
[227:29.62]Thank you.
[227:31.34]You're going to be okay.
[227:53.49]Shit, nevermind.
[227:55.75]Why would you hook in a- you didn't even kill him!
[228:06.96]You hooked in a sleep person and it didn't even work!
[228:22.56]And he missed that shot on him because I put him to sleep when he hooked him.
[228:27.38]So when he pulled the guy in with the hook, he was laying on the ground.
[228:30.92]And he missed it.
[228:33.86]Me and this Roadhog ain't syncing up.
[228:47.09]Don't get caught by the sniper.
[228:55.77]I knew I was gonna get my diddle, my diddle dwarsted.
[229:01.24]Okay.
[229:24.31]To countersnipe Widowmaker, I won't hesitate this time.
[229:30.44]We got a roof reaper.
[229:36.64]I should have not done that.
[229:54.73]I gotta think of a solution to this.
[229:56.11]It's just too hot in here.
[229:59.44]Yeah, I know, it's been... I've been trying to figure out a solution to this issue.
[230:02.94]Yeah, I feel you.
[230:06.72]Got a fan going, but... Man, that, like, one second of making sure I wasn't muted got me killed.
[230:21.48]I mean, not killed, but...
[230:25.46]I think you're ruining my Overwatch career.
[230:28.62]Oh no, not the PTR.
[230:38.53]Hey everybody, Jerma here, and oh fuck this, it's too hot in here.
[230:44.48]Yeah, I'm not even gonna do it, like, let's do it like next week, it's gonna be cooler.
[230:49.02]Yeah, it's gonna be much cooler in like a day or two.
[230:54.50]Well at least it's like a little nicer than yesterday.
[230:57.20]It was like unbearable yesterday.
[231:02.07]Is that D.Va gonna kill?
[231:11.27]I really wanted it to kill everyone.
[231:14.45]Come on, damage boosted baby D.Va.
[231:23.88]No, it's Baby Diva.
[231:24.82]What are you talking about?
[231:25.52]That's the fucking... She's not in the beetle.
[231:29.04]She's like a larva.
[231:31.26]What?
[231:31.90]I like Zero Suit Diva.
[231:34.06]And everyone started calling her Baby Suit.
[231:36.44]Not Baby Suit.
[231:38.88]That's her first life cycle of the Diva.
[231:42.19]She's a larva, and then she grows into a full-grown beetle.
[231:46.35]Come on.
[231:47.21]Get it fucking right.
[231:49.77]Please.
[231:50.13]Please.
[231:50.67]Okay, my bad.
[231:52.77]Ronnie, no!
[232:14.42]Did you tell on your stream the two mystery games we're playing today?
[232:18.20]I told them we're playing Necropolis first.
[232:21.85]I wanted to play that, and I didn't want to tell them what game you want to play.
[232:24.77]Alright.
[232:26.45]We've got a mystery game to play.
[232:30.79]I think also Necropolis, I'm going to host you.
[232:34.74]And you can do whatever you want.
[232:37.57]You're not going to stream it?
[232:40.39]No.
[232:40.57]Why not?
[232:42.05]Are you like an only Overwatch channel now?
[232:43.93]No, I'm going to stream Necropolis and then I'm going to host you for the next one.
[232:48.09]Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[232:49.23]You like don't want me to host your stream?
[232:51.31]No, I just thought you were going to play Overwatch for like five rounds and then turn your stream off.
[233:00.46]I'll save Dana for you if you want her.
[233:03.74]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[233:20.63]At which point of it, the mystery game is the Room 3.
[233:22.71]That is a mystery game.
[233:24.69]It's a great series.
[233:25.66]What a great bunch of games.
[233:32.80]All three of them, man.
[233:35.24]The mystery game is just Overwatch.
[233:37.45]You guys are never gonna guess what this is.
[233:42.37]I'm pretty excited for it.
[233:43.65]I think it'll be fun.
[233:45.71]I think the Acropolis will be slightly fun up until the 30 minute mark.
[233:51.66]Well look, Necropolis is like the game we're gonna play and then like the mystery game might actually be interesting for like 25 minutes.
[233:59.57]I don't know.
[234:00.13]I think the mystery game is more exciting.
[234:03.41]Really?
[234:05.40]It looks like fun.
[234:07.84]Especially, it's multiplayer, right?
[234:09.80]So I mean, drama versus star.
[234:12.66]If it actually works.
[234:14.06]Oh, if it doesn't work, even better.
[234:22.47]Like, if we can actually connect to each other, it is one of those games where it's just... Yeah, if we can connect, because, you know, Mystery Game is, um... It's 20 questions.
[234:33.33]It's 1 versus 100 on the Xbox 360.
[234:36.03]I'm gonna just get my dog in here, and we can figure this out.
[234:49.34]Be right back.
[234:52.08]Okay, just, you know, another thing to wait for.
[235:01.04]Okay, let's have a good game of Ana to go out on, because this is our last Overwatch game.
[235:08.28]I shot through his bow.
[235:13.78]Mystery game is Gwent.
[235:18.56]I cannot hit this guy I had to do it
[235:39.45]Never mind, I got teabagged by Mercy.
[235:40.51]He went on a three-week video game bender that cost him his health, job, and his wife.
[235:45.07]This is Mystery Diners.
[235:45.91]These are my Mystery Diners.
[235:47.85]You see, Greg, uh, you don't understand.
[235:49.50]The problem here is, uh, you didn't know that Tara was a Mystery Diner.
[235:53.16]Ah, shit.
[235:54.06]Really?
[235:54.88]Yeah, she was.
[235:55.40]She works for me.
[235:56.46]She works for me.
[235:57.04]She's a Mystery Diner.
[235:59.90]Ah, well, fuck this whole company.
[236:03.51]I just did every episode of that show.
[236:06.45]For your show.
[236:07.75]Wow, none of those hit me.
[236:10.41]Mystery Diners, come on.
[236:13.82]I've never heard of that show.
[236:16.08]I've never stolen from this company.
[236:19.16]Well, you see, that's the problem, Greg.
[236:21.08]We have you on camera stealing $200 from my Mystery Diners.
[236:26.37]Oh, yeah.
[236:27.25]Well, fuck you and the whole company.
[236:31.51]Okay.
[236:32.61]Thanks, um, I sold my head but not my stereo.
[236:36.40]That's a long name.
[236:38.50]That's like maximum Twitch characters probably.
[236:42.13]That's a Food Network show.
[236:43.61]You're not into that show?
[236:44.99]No, I've never seen it.
[236:47.11]I've never heard of it.
[236:48.19]That's probably one of the New Age ones.
[236:50.78]No it isn't.
[236:56.65]And they have the owner flipping out like, I can't believe this.
[237:00.08]I hired this guy when he was like 15 years old.
[237:02.72]He's been a part of the family.
[237:04.94]Oh, damn it.
[237:05.92]And then he storms out.
[237:06.80]Come here, you, in the back room.
[237:09.96]Hey, what's going on, dude?
[237:12.74]What is the premise of the show?
[237:16.67]You can't determine what the premise of the show is?
[237:19.48]Just talk to me like a fucking human being.
[237:21.86]Alright, okay.
[237:22.52]Mustache guy.
[237:23.46]Mustache guy.
[237:23.80]Runs a company.
[237:24.60]Yes.
[237:25.38]Mustache guy runs a company that he sets up like a stakeout.
[237:30.95]And restaurants that are like bleeding money, like, oh, you know, I don't know what's going on.
[237:35.55]Like, I was up like 20 grand last month.
[237:37.91]I'm down like 10 grand.
[237:39.05]Get in there.
[237:40.79]They stake out the restaurant to see where they're losing the money.
[237:44.40]Like if there's employees that are stealing.
[237:46.70]If there's people serving the wrong menu items.
[237:49.42]And it always turns out there's one bartender that's pocketing 20s during the whole... And the whole thing's fucking scripted.
[237:56.38]None of it's real.
[237:57.04]There's no way it's real.
[238:00.15]And finally they figure out the guy that's causing all the problems and they bring him into the back room and confront him.
[238:09.63]I feel like I recognize this premise, but like with a different show name.
[238:14.07]Yeah, it was called like another show.
[238:15.65]It was a different show.
[238:16.51]They just did it again.
[238:18.88]What's the name of the new one?
[238:21.34]Doesn't have a mustache?
[238:22.32]Oh my god, that is a full-on mustache.
[238:24.34]That is Charles Stiles from Mystery Diners.
[238:28.15]Charles Stiles.
[238:28.97]Charles Stiles, right?
[238:32.17]Yes, there he is.
[238:33.39]There's the Mystery Diner himself.
[238:36.75]Looks like Tim Wakefield from Boston Red Sox.
[238:39.41]Sorry, I shouldn't be talking to people.
[238:41.44]Somebody will get that and probably laugh at what I just said.
[238:44.88]You're welcome for your fucking afternoon chuckle, by the way, if you're a Red Sox fan.
[238:48.66]Undercover Boss.
[238:50.06]No, there's a Food Network specific one.
[238:53.68]It's not Undercover Boss.
[238:56.08]No, no.
[238:58.72]I think it's called Restaurant Steakout or something.
[239:00.47]Something like that.
[239:02.35]And it's awful.
[239:02.83]This one's bad, too.
[239:07.72]Nightmare Kitchen?
[239:08.82]That might be it.
[239:09.36]I don't think so, though.
[239:11.16]Nightmare Kitchen was... Isn't that the Jordan... Gordon Ramsay show?
[239:18.99]Isn't that the Michael Jordan show?
[239:20.35]Yeah, the Michael Jordan show.
[239:21.51]I don't know.
[239:26.12]Either way.
[239:28.06]Hate it.
[239:32.55]I need to think of a cool stream title.
[239:34.61]Good games, Ronnie.
[239:35.77]I'm gonna go.
[239:36.42]How about The Buddy Stream?
[239:45.08]That's my rank.
[239:46.08]Alright, it's gonna be called Buddy Stream with Good Buddy.
[239:48.90]I wanna drop.
[239:50.60]I wanna be like a 50 on the PTR.
[239:59.06]Okay, so... Do you use a controller for Necropolis?
[240:02.32]Uh, I'm going to, yeah.
[240:04.76]Hold on.
[240:06.76]Let me say good... Hold on, yes, control, yeah, hold on.
[240:12.11]Uh... Everybody, we're done with Overwatch for the day.
[240:15.81]Me and Jerm are just gonna play some goofball games.
[240:18.19]We're gonna start off on Necropolis, and we have one other game that's... It's a goofball game.
[240:24.02]So if you're only here for Overwatch, that's cool, whatever, we're moving on.
[240:30.51]I'll be back on Tuesday because I don't stream on Mondays, so I'll see you then.
[240:35.73]I am turning on my stream.
[240:41.24]Yeah.
[240:42.58]That's that.
[240:42.94]I wish my phone would turn on.
[240:53.57]I was in the middle of a text with somebody.
[241:05.85]Oh, mystery games.
[241:07.21]It's gotta be TF2.
[241:08.35]What are we playing?
[241:16.14]I'm sorry, guys.
[241:17.08]I didn't even, like, do anything on my stream.
[241:18.60]I didn't even start.
[241:19.86]Like, I didn't get the right thing correct.
[241:22.26]You didn't even download the games.
[241:24.44]It's gonna be another hour.
[241:25.40]You know what?
[241:27.22]How about we just do this at 4 p.m.?
[241:29.04]You know, why don't we just, like, you know, we're just, like, kind of chilling.
[241:31.32]Why don't we just get this really started at 4 p.m.? ?
[241:35.43]Alright, I'm gonna have to, like, I have to do, I have to yell some people's names.
[241:39.01]So, sorry, I'll be back.
[241:49.21]Hold on to that desperate hope in assuming that I actually have TF2 installed on my computer.
[241:55.73]I do not.
[242:01.79]So I actually haven't opened up this game a single time, so it's probably going to be extremely loud.
[242:08.80]This is not a bathroom break.
[242:11.26]This is a hold on switching games.
[242:13.56]I don't even have that screen.
[242:14.94]I usually don't switch games during streams ever.
[242:27.63]So I apologize if we have some really loud main menu music come up in just a second here.
[242:42.20]I'm just waiting for Steam to stop having people invite you to group pop up show up for the next minute on the bottom left corner of my screen.
[242:50.75]Or I even try and open it.
[242:54.08]Steam's a really good program.
[242:55.24]It gets updated often.
[242:56.48]Uh, Greenlight, really good.
[242:58.30]Really, really good.
[243:07.10]A necropolis opened on the wrong monitor.
[243:10.35]It's going to be really- It's- Oh, God.
[243:22.97]But that-
[243:32.16]uh so I'm gonna play in a window so I can drag it to the right monitor so
[244:01.45]The streamers look very slow.
[244:03.49]Jerma!
[244:05.63]What up?
[244:06.95]I'm ready.
[244:08.01]Hold on one sec.
[244:10.55]Jerma, I'm ready.
[244:14.07]Jerma, I'm ready.
[244:17.38]Hold on, Star.
[244:17.98]Double sub.
[244:18.56]Don't you know what that means?
[244:19.68]Oh, double sub.
[244:20.46]Double sub.
[244:21.10]Double, double, double sub.
[244:22.54]We have to sing the birthday song, right?
[244:25.06]Yeah.
[244:25.52]Ready?
[244:26.60]Doubles up.
[244:27.82]Doubles up.
[244:32.54]They don't do that anymore.
[244:36.34]They don't do that anymore.
[244:37.42]Name me a place you've been to where a bunch of people crowd around and do like, happy birthday, happy birthday.
[244:42.51]They don't do it anymore.
[244:43.21]It's embarrassing.
[244:43.97]It's become enough of a joke that everyone knows.
[244:51.72]It's become enough of a joke.
[244:53.84]No service.
[244:54.54]How do I not have fucking service?
[244:58.06]God damn.
[245:01.97]I heard this game has like two hours worth of content.
[245:04.51]Well, you're in for a fucking two hours.
[245:06.99]Treat.
[245:11.27]I want to see for myself.
[245:16.03]If Jerma will.
[245:17.29]Ever.
[245:18.33]I'm in.
[245:19.27]How do we, like, how do we, I need, hold on, I wasn't ready to, like, I told you I wasn't ready to stream.
[245:22.94]I got my shit going.
[245:24.00]Hold on.
[245:24.82]Well, number one, you have to actually go online on Steam.
[245:27.70]I know that's asking a little bit much for me.
[245:30.88]Wait, what are you saying?
[245:33.02]Asking me what?
[245:33.52]That's asking a lot for you to come online on Steam.
[245:38.62]Shut the fuck up.
[245:39.64]When was the last time you were online on Steam?
[245:43.76]Oh, God, it's been a long time.
[245:47.22]It's probably been, like, a month.
[245:48.86]Maybe a full month.
[245:55.51]See, like, I just comment online, somebody's already messaged me.
[245:58.71]It's me inviting you to a game!
[246:01.27]I know.
[246:01.71]That was the joke.
[246:03.29]I'm glad you got it.
[246:05.28]No one else got it.
[246:07.40]Yeah, you and I did.
[246:08.08]I'm explaining.
[246:08.90]Okay.
[246:10.36]I should just text on stream.
[246:12.38]I'll give an update.
[246:13.10]I have a situation update, guys, from the Wolf Blitzer situation room.
[246:17.67]I know what the situation is.
[246:19.45]We'll talk about that some other, maybe a little bit later, so we don't invade on Star's stream.
[246:24.19]Last Jerma stream, he was checking a lot of Tinder.
[246:27.15]This stream is, he used to announce that he has been issued a court order for sexual assault.
[246:35.00]Jesus, easy.
[246:37.60]Don't spoil it.
[246:39.52]No, I got a... I got a... I got a fucking... Where are you?
[246:43.78]What is your name?
[246:45.12]Sh... Shadduf.
[246:48.53]Yeah, how do I... I invited you.
[246:49.95]Come on, Darren.
[246:57.57]I don't know... Okay.
[246:59.81]I just took it.
[247:01.79]Are you with me?
[247:03.41]I don't know.
[247:04.01]How am I?
[247:04.55]It says there's available slots for friends.
[247:09.21]I gotta restart the game.
[247:10.21]It says I'm on offline.
[247:11.95]I'm going to the bathroom then.
[247:13.69]It's a bathroom break.
[247:14.65]Go take a piss.
[247:15.67]God damn it.
[247:16.27]Go get it out of your system.
[247:18.81]Go get it out of your system.
[247:23.34]E. Offline.
[247:24.88]Network connection.
[247:25.58]Okay.
[247:26.18]Let me try this.
[247:28.28]This is going to leave and come back.
[247:33.10]Look.
[247:33.36]Go get it out of your system.
[247:34.56]Okay?
[247:38.69]I'm gonna play this for a little bit.
[247:39.57]I don't know how much fun this game is, though, guys.
[247:41.49]I have no idea.
[247:43.42]Across both of our streams, I'm not sure if this is gonna be good, bad.
[247:47.46]I've heard very, very, very, very, very good and very bad things about this game.
[247:52.22]So, mm-hmm.
[247:53.99]Okay, it actually works now.
[247:55.03]I just need to wait for his invite.
[247:56.13]In the meantime, I'm going to make a Twitter tweet that says, Yo!
[248:02.41]What's up, bros?
[248:03.45]Streaming!
[248:04.85]Come hang!
[248:06.59]I'm going to get so many people that are going to be like, what?
[248:08.29]He's Skullclaw?
[248:09.81]Necropolis?
[248:12.27]You get to play as Black Mage?
[248:15.01]Final Fantasy 3?
[248:17.53]I remember that game from the Super Nintendo.
[248:20.27]Regular Nintendo.
[248:22.48]Mega.
[248:22.76]Alright, that hurts.
[248:31.82]Save the buddy stream for you guys.
[248:32.90]I got to get my chat too.
[248:33.82]I can't see what the fuck anybody's saying.
[248:40.29]Wait, what?
[248:41.38]Somebody subbed.
[248:48.48]Are you ready?
[248:54.66]Hello?
[248:56.72]Invite me.
[248:59.12]Oh, nice.
[249:00.12]A party invite.
[249:06.91]Okie dokie.
[249:11.65]Uh, oh look, we're both walking.
[249:13.67]I need to get, look, where's my controller?
[249:14.81]There we go.
[249:16.01]How do I... My background?
[249:21.83]My, okay, black, just, blackguard.
[249:25.80]Okay.
[249:26.24]We, am I, are we creating a character right here?
[249:28.82]Is that what's going on?
[249:29.38]No, no, you find the items in the game, but I mean, I think you're just choosing, like, colors.
[249:32.88]Son, okay, son or daughter.
[249:35.82]How are you even doing that?
[249:36.40]I'm gonna be son of the sea of glass.
[249:37.78]Up and down on, uh, do you, are you using a, what are you using?
[249:40.90]I'm using a controller.
[249:42.62]Well, it's up and down.
[249:44.36]Left and right.
[249:46.44]Up and down and left and right.
[249:47.60]I'm going to be a son of the sea of glass.
[249:49.62]Ooh, ooh, I could be the daughter.
[249:50.92]Ooh, I'm so skinny.
[249:53.08]Dude, don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.
[249:55.34]And if you live in a glass house, I'm going to shut your mouth.
[249:57.36]I'll break your face.
[249:58.26]That was pretty good.
[250:02.32]I don't even know what the lyrics are.
[250:03.68]Okay, let's go.
[250:04.44]New game.
[250:05.60]Start game.
[250:06.08]Shit, I didn't even...
[250:11.95]Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.
[250:13.67]And if you live in a glass house, if you live in a glass house, because I live in a glass house.
[250:21.98]Okay.
[250:22.64]Where are you?
[250:23.78]You didn't skip the thing, did you?
[250:26.02]There's nothing for me to skip.
[250:28.97]Oh.
[250:29.73]Okay.
[250:32.93]Hello?
[250:34.45]Are you skipping the cutscene?
[250:35.93]Is that what you're doing?
[250:37.55]Yes, yes.
[250:37.73]Alright, well, come on.
[250:38.72]Don't fucking live in a glass house, alright?
[250:40.36]What's a glass house?
[250:41.80]A game crash.
[250:43.40]Did it really?
[250:44.45]Oh, no, no, no.
[250:45.01]Okay, hold on.
[250:45.80]I ate my, uh, I accidentally ate my thingy.
[250:48.92]Oh.
[250:49.12]There's two Dark Souls buttons, and X is not attack.
[250:52.30]Oh.
[250:53.40]Really, so... Oh, yeah, there is team damage.
[250:57.23]Oh, that's great to know.
[250:58.31]Fantastic.
[250:58.95]Okay, so is this just Dark Souls, but not Dark Souls?
[251:02.15]No, this is a shitty indie game that makes you think it's Dark Souls, but is actually in almost no way similar.
[251:09.15]Oh, okay.
[251:10.45]Well, let's go.
[251:12.89]Oh, look at the buttons!
[251:14.69]Let me see what buttons I need to be pressing here.
[251:17.65]Okay, live in a glass house, don't throw stones.
[251:19.28]If you live in a glass house, if you live in a glass house, if you live in a glass house.
[251:21.80]I got it.
[251:24.22]Okay, and if you live in a glass house, if you're living in a glass house... Hey, I think we're supposed to go this way.
[251:31.71]The ancient Aztec wind waker sign is there.
[251:36.09]Oh yeah, the ancient Aztec wind waker sign.
[251:38.08]Let's go.
[251:40.96]This game's very dark.
[251:42.02]I'm gonna turn up my brightness, I think.
[251:43.36]Okay, yeah, no, just wait another, like, 30 minutes for Jerma to be ready.
[251:45.97]Because if you live in a glass house and you live in a- Watch out!
[251:49.39]Dude, fucking stop living in a glass house!
[251:51.09]You got enemies to fight.
[251:52.14]Nice work.
[251:55.08]I'm, like, scared to even go near you because we can hurt each other.
[252:00.91]Yeah, take turns.
[252:01.69]Alright, there's a sword.
[252:03.97]Okay, and if you live in a glass house... God damn it!
[252:07.16]How is everything you say is like, this catchy?
[252:11.30]What?
[252:13.44]Would you interact with the giant crystal?
[252:18.10]Oh.
[252:18.96]Uh... I'm interacting.
[252:23.46]Save the game.
[252:24.18]Save your game, dude.
[252:25.16]Oh, I think only one of us has to do that.
[252:27.70]The animation is so slow.
[252:28.84]The animations in this game don't look like they are the same frame rate as any.
[252:35.20]You might be dead.
[252:36.66]No, I like tested what holding right clicked it and I went down the well.
[252:42.96]Am I supposed to jump down?
[252:44.93]If I were you, I'd come down the well.
[252:47.93]There's a giant.
[252:48.85]Okay, there's a giant.
[252:49.63]Illuminati.
[252:51.25]Oh, interact.
[252:53.28]Quick, interact with the Illuminati.
[252:54.78]Now go down the- Stop!
[252:56.36]I don't think you can do it.
[252:59.32]No, don't do that.
[253:03.07]It was an elevator, Jerma.
[253:04.73]Interacting is- it's an elevator.
[253:06.61]Okay, well we fell down the first well.
[253:08.31]This is the second- I thought it was the second well.
[253:10.91]Fuckin' stones.
[253:12.29]Oh, there's a run.
[253:18.16]With you pushing left stick.
[253:20.90]Okay.
[253:21.86]Okay, we're learning.
[253:22.86]We're new to this.
[253:24.08]Okay, so when you push in the left stick, you do the, I'm an anime character running at my enemy about to attack.
[253:28.62]Yeah.
[253:32.24]How do you hold the shield up?
[253:34.10]Left bumper.
[253:35.46]Yeah, you push in the right stick, too.
[253:39.26]Yeah.
[253:40.13]Oh, hold on.
[253:40.73]I gotta actually do something.
[253:43.51]Oh, no.
[253:43.69]Oh, you're gonna wait for Star.
[253:45.07]Oh, thanks.
[253:45.97]Lucario subbed to me.
[253:47.51]He's a Smash character.
[253:49.31]Come on, man.
[253:51.75]Gotta wait for Star.
[253:52.79]He's not ready to start his stream.
[253:57.17]Can we go?
[253:57.79]Watch out, there's a fucking Power Rangers over here.
[254:01.38]Watch out for this.
[254:01.88]There's the yellow one.
[254:02.54]Yeah, you gotta do the start your animation trick.
[254:05.40]Oh, wait.
[254:05.58]Watch out.
[254:06.28]Watch out for Tyrion.
[254:08.56]Here, you fight them.
[254:09.16]Uh-oh, fucking Tyrion Fordrick.
[254:11.34]Whoa!
[254:11.88]Whoa!
[254:12.24]Whoa!
[254:12.58]Whoa!
[254:13.05]Whoa!
[254:13.85]These laser beams guys care that I exist, but nobody else does.
[254:16.39]He just hit me.
[254:20.15]Shut up.
[254:22.02]I'm trying to act like an excited streamer.
[254:23.89]Whoa!
[254:26.13]I got the crystal sword.
[254:26.89]Well, I got the buckler.
[254:33.96]Alright, let's keep going.
[254:34.92]You got a shield bash.
[254:35.74]I don't think that's the same thing as a parry, but I heard it's good.
[254:38.12]No, it's not a parry.
[254:39.82]That's because... I tried to parry this guy.
[254:42.78]It's a parry.
[254:43.26]It worked.
[254:43.98]Wait, no.
[254:44.76]Are you sure?
[254:45.12]Are you sure you didn't just bash him and it looked like a parry?
[254:47.66]Yeah, no, no.
[254:49.36]He fell backwards.
[254:50.68]Yeah, I know, but I don't... It's not a parry.
[254:52.77]It's a bash.
[254:54.39]Yeah.
[254:55.05]I don't know.
[254:55.49]You're wrong.
[254:57.17]They fall down, though.
[254:58.59]That's... God.
[255:00.07]You're dense.
[255:00.67]They don't fall... If I bash this guy right now, he's not gonna fall down.
[255:07.04]Bash him.
[255:07.74]Watch out for the fucking face.
[255:09.14]The faces of evil.
[255:10.50]I don't know why I'm, like, taking damage trying to prove to you that you're dense.
[255:16.67]How do I eat the food?
[255:18.45]Axe.
[255:20.68]We're gonna die in the first ten seconds.
[255:22.96]There's no reason for us to be going this fast and this quick, man.
[255:25.55]A lot of enemies in this here game.
[255:28.85]I didn't know you stood still for that long.
[255:34.79]Holy shit, that's very long to swing.
[255:41.39]Jerma the ass-eater.
[255:43.77]Look at this.
[255:44.29]Jerma taking on three enemies at once while Star runs away from one.
[255:48.78]Oh, Star's dead.
[255:49.80]Yeah.
[255:51.53]Where's the revive button?
[255:52.36]I can like press E and tap E on you.
[255:54.60]You really can.
[255:58.62]You actually can do that.
[256:02.18]Okay.
[256:04.04]No jokes.
[256:04.55]So what happened?
[256:05.29]No jokes.
[256:05.51]Yeah, but that was a joke.
[256:07.33]Jump down the well, no more jokes.
[256:10.31]Alright, well now that we have a second, let me tweet that I'm streaming.
[256:14.21]Oh my god.
[256:16.90]Yeah, you gotta wait for me, dude.
[256:18.40]Just retweet my tweet.
[256:20.83]No, because people are going to be like, oh, he's just a star follower.
[256:30.36]I'm never screaming with you again.
[256:33.74]This Star Wars character, by the way, keeps talking.
[256:42.26]It doesn't feel like you're in a cantina in Star Wars.
[256:51.66]Oh, even the enemies can hit other enemies.
[256:54.56]Oh, really?
[256:55.46]Apparently.
[256:55.92]Alright.
[256:59.11]Oh, god.
[256:59.51]I don't want to go down again.
[257:00.59]I wanted to wait up so I could get you up and we can actually play the game.
[257:03.87]Alright.
[257:10.88]So, we're just... I think I can just... It's jump in and jump out, I believe.
[257:19.63]Alright, so... Let's... No more jokes.
[257:21.83]Thank you.
[257:23.08]Let's, uh... No more messing around.
[257:25.04]Let's actually play.
[257:26.58]You didn't do 1, 2, 3.
[257:29.30]It goes the second you step on it.
[257:30.80]I can't 1, 2, 3.
[257:31.20]I'm gonna tell you, you're gonna have to 1, 2, 3 with this because it goes instantly.
[257:42.11]Oh, fuck.
[257:42.67]Holy shit.
[257:43.47]You are so close to being off.
[257:46.73]Okay.
[257:48.07]Is there, like, a pole?
[257:49.69]Is there a grab?
[257:52.45]No.
[257:53.99]Are we gonna kill all NPCs, Ron?
[257:56.39]Kill?
[257:58.13]Man, these cost money.
[257:59.19]I don't even have any gems.
[258:04.20]Let me interact.
[258:04.78]Ster is exhausting himself.
[258:09.64]I am not doing anything.
[258:14.00]Word on the town is the game's easier if you play with a second person, unless it's Jerma.
[258:20.50]We just started.
[258:21.24]We're just having fun.
[258:22.24]I'm not having any fun.
[258:23.79]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream, okay?
[258:26.03]I'm now part of the lucky few.
[258:27.85]Yeah, you haven't beaten the nameless one.
[258:31.53]Hey, I beat the game on stream.
[258:34.00]Yeah, that makes me part of the selective group of people that did that.
[258:38.84]You can talk all the shit you want.
[258:41.61]The selective people.
[258:42.89]Jerma's one of the selected people.
[258:45.52]Did you beat him first try?
[258:47.36]No.
[258:47.56]I'm just going to kind of be annoying to these guys while you do your thing.
[258:54.10]Doing my thing.
[259:00.35]Okay.
[259:00.83]You don't have any air attacks?
[259:03.37]You don't?
[259:03.73]Doesn't appear that you do.
[259:09.19]Yeah, you do.
[259:11.67]Yeah.
[259:12.59]R1.
[259:12.67]Jumping R1.
[259:15.29]Eat food to make your stamina bar full again?
[259:17.19]Eat food badly.
[259:20.77]Oh, because I've been standing around waiting for Jermina.
[259:23.73]Jermina.
[259:25.03]Stamina Jermina.
[259:28.01]Let's go.
[259:28.51]That was perfect.
[259:38.84]Let's hold my hand up to the door, don't just... Oh no, watch out for the balls.
[259:44.96]I'll get the spiders.
[259:53.39]Watch out for the balls.
[259:56.31]Watch out for the ball.
[259:57.85]Watch out for the moon spiders.
[259:58.99]Do you have to do anything with this money?
[260:01.43]Is this the gems you were talking about?
[260:05.87]You should give it all to me.
[260:08.24]I can't say I'm completely happy that you have to actually walk over to pick it up.
[260:11.09]I can't say I'm completely happy with how zoomed in this camera feels.
[260:14.95]If there's a way to pull it back, let me know.
[260:16.83]Because especially when the bottom of my screen says how many things I need to collect, I feel, like, claustrophobic.
[260:23.52]It does?
[260:24.40]Oh, yeah.
[260:24.82]It just keeps doing that, and it makes it feel like I'm, like, too close.
[260:30.80]Yeah, now that you said that, you just totally... I was alright until you said that.
[260:35.70]Yeah, now you're realizing that it's terrible.
[260:38.58]Remember to collect the creature droppings!
[260:44.15]Can you stop picking up the droppings and come help me fight the three bearded men?
[260:47.19]That guy lost his clothes.
[260:54.12]That guy turned into one of the things that they turn into in The Little Mermaid.
[260:58.61]You know when they don't have their powers and they're like the little slug people?
[261:01.11]That guy just looked like one.
[261:03.90]He went on a three-week video game bender that cost him his health, job, and wife.
[261:09.30]And tough nuts.
[261:10.92]Thanks, Tommy.
[261:11.48]Tough nuts.
[261:11.80]I need food badly, though, because I've been waiting for Jerma.
[261:18.12]Why did you have to say that?
[261:19.34]That's the only thing I can see.
[261:20.30]There has to be a way to turn that off.
[261:21.76]It's awful.
[261:26.65]Don't do it.
[261:27.71]Have you learned anything about games like this?
[261:29.45]Can't just look at the menu.
[261:41.56]Good plan.
[261:42.16]Nice kill.
[261:43.34]I'll collect creature droppings.
[261:46.06]And I'm already despising when you walk near an item and it has to tell you, like, the giant pop-up.
[261:51.14]It's all around.
[261:52.96]I'm being agitated.
[261:56.39]This is like a privacy button in this game.
[261:58.69]It says privacy open.
[261:59.97]Does that mean somebody can just look at me and go to the bathroom?
[262:06.81]Everyone asking how the game is.
[262:08.16]We've played it for three minutes.
[262:13.36]Where did these guys come from?
[262:18.90]I think they spawned in a corner, which I hear is a thing that happens.
[262:24.63]This game has left-for-dead mechanics?
[262:26.91]Yeah.
[262:27.15]Is this an AI director?
[262:28.05]Because if you kill the boomer, then they show up.
[262:38.50]Ow.
[262:40.70]This weapon's really slow.
[262:41.76]I'm not a fan.
[262:44.96]I, uh... Forgetting what the actual shield hold-up button is.
[262:51.39]in real life, has low self-esteem, you know, socially very awkward, but yet... Alright, good.
[262:56.45]I did, like, a nice show of swordsmanship for that guy.
[263:00.38]Lion's jaw, thanks.
[263:02.58]Hey.
[263:02.68]Alright.
[263:06.70]They're fighting each other.
[263:07.82]Can I go do a die here and you pick me up and I understand?
[263:10.97]They just spawned on top of me.
[263:13.61]Is that what you wanted to do?
[263:15.93]Let me die to one of these and you can pick me up and we'll see how that works.
[263:20.67]Oh my god.
[263:21.33]They just keep spawning here.
[263:22.56]Don't get zapped.
[263:28.28]I'm not going to get zapped.
[263:29.64]I don't like that weapon.
[263:32.12]Holy shit, they really are just spawning.
[263:35.65]Or just tap it, or just hit it once?
[263:38.85]Okay, yeah, that gives me some, like, free health and stamina.
[263:44.38]Where are they coming from?!
[263:46.98]From behind.
[263:48.02]And you gotta collect the dinosaur droppings.
[263:56.04]Oh, shit, I'm sorry, I hit you right in the back.
[263:57.71]You hit me way more badly than I hit you.
[263:59.13]No, shut up!
[264:00.87]Fuck, there's one more gem over here!
[264:02.09]There's one more jewel!
[264:07.71]I don't know, I'm kind of almost at the point already where I just want to play the next game.
[264:14.29]Really?
[264:15.49]Yeah.
[264:18.27]Wow, really?
[264:19.05]You didn't even give it a chance.
[264:24.75]It just steals.
[264:25.55]Look it, you're dead.
[264:30.29]Game kind of sucks.
[264:31.63]Let me eat my giant turkey leg.
[264:39.39]I was giving it the benefit of the doubt from everything I've heard.
[264:41.57]Am I muted right now?
[264:42.49]No, you're not.
[264:52.36]We're gonna keep gaming though.
[264:53.54]Game on.
[264:54.08]Uh, excuse me.
[264:55.48]Game on.
[264:55.92]Hey, that's my chest.
[264:56.88]That's my chest.
[264:58.74]Oh, really?
[265:00.76]Good luck.
[265:01.46]I got the magic hat.
[265:02.26]That's my hat.
[265:03.00]No!
[265:03.78]Ah, yeah, that's me.
[265:06.83]You can put my old, dirty, sweaty hat on if you want.
[265:10.67]Does it smell like me in there?
[265:11.67]It's just the same hat.
[265:13.31]Oh, there's a thorium deposit over here.
[265:15.24]I gotta get it.
[265:17.24]Oh, that's not you.
[265:18.46]I thought this old guy was you for a second.
[265:22.82]Wasn't this game stirs the idea?
[265:24.68]It was.
[265:25.26]I really had high hopes.
[265:27.88]This feels so clunky and zoomed in and...
[265:31.83]Hey, you wanna play Necropolis on stream together?
[265:34.37]Oh yeah, cool.
[265:35.23]Hey, it's like 30 bucks.
[265:36.25]We're gonna stream it for like 19 minutes.
[265:40.57]Enemies just keep spawning out of nowhere and... I'm gonna dazzle this guy.
[265:47.92]Let this guy live.
[265:49.34]Oh!
[265:49.74]There was a guy behind me to dazzle.
[265:51.12]You dazzled me.
[265:51.90]Sorry.
[265:53.42]Apparently a dazzling reduces your max stamina for some reason.
[265:58.90]So it's an ability that you'll never use.
[266:03.34]This is what I'm wearing.
[266:04.84]I'm not gonna lie.
[266:06.04]Yeah.
[266:06.94]This game makes me kind of want to throw up.
[266:08.81]That's what I'm saying!
[266:11.91]I'm gonna be honest.
[266:13.15]I'm gonna be completely and totally honest.
[266:16.39]Turning, like, turning around for some reason makes me kind of want to, like, never play the game again.
[266:22.62]Watch out!
[266:24.82]It's way too zoomed in.
[266:26.34]I don't know if it's that.
[266:29.20]I think it's, like, the colors.
[266:33.68]I'm telling you it's that.
[266:35.00]Listen to me.
[266:41.04]Okay, I'm really low on health, so let it kill me, and I'll get the full heal from you.
[266:49.21]Thanks.
[266:52.91]Just kill me and resurrect me.
[266:56.46]Oh, we can just do it to each other.
[267:00.28]Alright, yeah.
[267:01.52]You want a free health potion?
[267:03.08]Kill your friend.
[267:03.76]This is a different enemy.
[267:07.55]This guy doesn't have a beard.
[267:08.39]Ow.
[267:16.15]Oh, I think there's a dash, actually.
[267:19.87]How do you dash?
[267:22.48]Same button that it is on.
[267:26.92]That helps.
[267:28.69]Hey, I took one point of damage.
[267:29.75]You wanna resurrect me real quick?
[267:32.15]Will you like... Oh, hey, you know what?
[267:33.91]Kill me.
[267:34.49]Resurrect me.
[267:34.93]You just took... I took way too much damage there.
[267:41.28]Don't die.
[267:41.86]Oh, you're... After this... Hey, after I kill this... Yeah, after this fight.
[267:46.76]Yeah, okay.
[267:47.38]Now make sure you kill me.
[267:48.74]Okay, resurrect me.
[267:49.98]Yeah.
[267:50.70]We wanna be healthy for the... Yeah, okay, good.
[267:57.03]What is this?
[267:57.39]What's this?
[267:57.93]Oh, it's just a frozen flame.
[267:59.35]Chrono Cross!
[268:00.72]It hurt me.
[268:00.98]You're going to have to kill me and resurrect me.
[268:02.26]You're going to have to kill me too and resurrect me.
[268:04.00]I took a little damage there myself.
[268:13.02]Oh, let's go.
[268:15.05]Oh!
[268:15.17]Is there a baby?
[268:23.17]Okay, now you have to.
[268:25.85]Damn.
[268:27.29]I got all turned around.
[268:28.27]Which way are we supposed to be going?
[268:30.33]I don't know.
[268:32.85]They might be diminishing returns with what we're doing, though.
[268:35.78]Is that what people are telling you?
[268:37.04]Because it doesn't look like there is.
[268:38.80]I just feel like if that mechanic was in the game, it would be diminished returns on that move.
[268:44.20]I think you feel... I think your feelings are correct, but the reality is different.
[268:50.46]This requires $200 to open.
[268:53.83]Why?
[268:54.19]Gotta wait for the door anyway.
[268:57.39]Did I even spend the 200 money?
[268:59.41]I don't think I even spent anything.
[269:04.48]Boss.
[269:04.96]That's a boss.
[269:06.68]Look at that.
[269:07.12]Okay, you thought this game wasn't like, that's a boss.
[269:09.64]We're gonna activate that.
[269:10.64]I don't have 500 gems.
[269:12.66]Fuck.
[269:13.06]Can we pool our money together?
[269:14.10]Can we like buy a pizza together?
[269:17.94]I can just go in it.
[269:21.79]No, that's not gonna work.
[269:24.05]That thing's gonna knock over, and that guy's gonna walk up with his big sword in his hand.
[269:31.88]Zalada.
[269:35.36]Oh, there's the old man in the mountain.
[269:39.49]Only one of us can talk to him at a time.
[269:41.03]Okay, standard ration.
[269:44.57]Old man's essentials.
[269:47.25]Rotten food.
[269:51.26]Roll of Identify.
[269:52.34]I'm just gonna buy one.
[269:55.31]I don't know if that was... Buy one of these, uh... Okay.
[270:01.65]Can you only hold one item?
[270:05.29]Oh, you can... You have multiple weapons.
[270:06.77]Can you change weapons?
[270:10.73]Left on the D-pad.
[270:15.78]Haha, you can't buy anything.
[270:17.12]I was trying to kill you both.
[270:21.15]Oh, I thought, like, I want to use the vendor.
[270:23.58]Go away.
[270:25.82]No, I wanted to, like, kill the vendor while you were using it and you.
[270:31.07]Oh, what's this?
[270:34.77]Ooh.
[270:37.26]I... I... I don't know.
[270:40.52]This is the library over here.
[270:41.50]I think those are the permanent upgrades that you can get to your character.
[270:45.75]That type of currency.
[270:47.63]The next time you see Star in real life, kick the shit out of him.
[270:51.33]I agree.
[270:51.73]Why?
[270:52.79]What'd he do?
[270:53.99]By the way, it's gonna be thundering and lightning-ing.
[270:55.69]Today?
[270:56.81]I'm gonna have to close my roof.
[270:59.19]There's no... I can hear it.
[271:13.61]We're gonna have to 1-2-3 this.
[271:17.53]Okay.
[271:19.00]Wait, there's nothing to 1-2-3.
[271:19.88]Are you sure?
[271:20.66]Alright, ready?
[271:23.24]Wait, no.
[271:24.14]Here comes the 1-2-3.
[271:25.22]It's coming up.
[271:27.00]Wow, that's a very long 1-2-3.
[271:28.76]This is more like a 4-5-6-7-8-9-10.
[271:31.52]I can't stand it.
[271:33.34]I have to do it.
[271:34.62]I'm fine.
[271:40.29]Why?
[271:41.77]You're fine.
[271:42.35]You're alive.
[271:42.99]You're here.
[271:45.65]Yeah, nice try.
[271:46.93]I don't think I knew you were going to try to do that after I tried to do it to you.
[271:56.25]I just like... Oh, God.
[271:58.35]Oh, my God.
[272:00.91]Something's really not happening.
[272:02.85]Something's wrong.
[272:03.85]Something's really not happening.
[272:05.19]Something's wrong.
[272:05.71]I don't know what happened.
[272:08.39]I don't know where I am.
[272:10.81]You probably fell through the map.
[272:14.55]I'm in a different zone.
[272:19.86]There's a chest here.
[272:21.32]Where are you?
[272:22.48]Guys!
[272:23.40]I got a fucking free chest for like falling through the Earth.
[272:25.72]There's a bird in here.
[272:28.36]What the fuck?
[272:29.42]What?
[272:33.16]Yeah, you wish you had a bird chest in your zone.
[272:40.69]We're playing two different games now.
[272:43.67]Oh, you just respawned at the top of the elevator.
[272:47.28]What?
[272:48.22]Then where was the bird chest?
[272:50.66]We just walked to a different area that we haven't been at yet.
[272:53.84]There's no bird chests.
[272:55.47]Yes, there is!
[272:56.73]Okay.
[272:57.57]There's no bird chests.
[272:58.45]No, not there's no bird chests.
[273:00.49]I know what you're talking about.
[273:01.51]There's a turkey in a box, right?
[273:05.18]I'm just saying you didn't have to go that way.
[273:07.46]There's no map.
[273:07.82]You're going to have to come back here and you're going to have to... I have no fucking idea where you're talking about because everything is the same.
[273:14.78]Can you see... Look through the ground and you can see my name.
[273:18.17]Oh, God.
[273:18.73]Okay.
[273:19.71]Good luck.
[273:23.41]There's a turkey in a box.
[273:26.91]Oh, I found it.
[273:28.77]Found it!
[273:36.71]Found the secret passage!
[273:38.47]Hold on, I got a fucking bearded man chasing me!
[273:41.05]Wait, wait, hold on, this is gonna be funny.
[273:42.33]You're gonna be able to see this.
[273:43.97]Go to like the elevator.
[273:46.46]I'm gonna send you a surprise.
[273:49.66]Fucking get back down there, you're missing the surprise.
[273:57.97]Come on!
[273:59.67]You're alive, you're fine.
[274:01.13]No, no, no, no.
[274:02.13]Don't.
[274:02.73]Why?
[274:03.57]Don't.
[274:04.13]Don't.
[274:04.69]Oh, can we get on the roof?
[274:06.17]Oh, look, this looks cool now.
[274:09.63]Don't.
[274:10.05]Don't.
[274:10.49]Don't.
[274:10.97]Don't.
[274:11.45]Don't.
[274:11.77]I'm not gonna do anything.
[274:13.15]Every time I say don't, it resets the amount of time that you're gonna do it by like five seconds.
[274:18.06]Oh, cool.
[274:18.52]Golden chest.
[274:19.92]Wish I had a golden chest instead of a turkey box.
[274:22.38]Yeah, if only you'd come this way, then you would've got the hat that I have.
[274:30.46]Fucking kill the big Triforce of Wisdom!
[274:36.29]Whoa!
[274:36.47]Watch out!
[274:39.59]Seriously, the back of these spiders is jermaMoon.
[274:41.59]Hey, can you do me a favor?
[274:44.53]Can you give me a full heal with your heal power you have?
[274:49.59]Okay, can you do me a favor?
[274:51.30]Yeah.
[274:54.34]You want me to heal you?
[274:55.26]I can heal you.
[274:56.12]I can use a full heal.
[274:57.02]Alright.
[275:01.51]Ressorecto?
[275:03.75]Ressarec?
[275:04.23]Does that mean, like, heal in Spanish or something?
[275:08.30]Yeah.
[275:10.70]God, did you hear that funny joke I just said?
[275:12.88]No.
[275:15.08]Alright, read this.
[275:18.22]Flow was spotless last weekend until the grind threw a keg-a.
[275:28.15]This is a very narrow hallway.
[275:29.23]I'm just going to kind of let you do your thing in there.
[275:32.93]Yeah, and when I die, you just come resurrect me and clean up.
[275:36.85]I'm just mashing.
[275:38.09]Like, my health doesn't matter.
[275:39.53]Okay, do it.
[275:40.55]Kill me.
[275:42.39]This is the worst.
[275:44.35]This is awful.
[275:48.47]Hey, you know, I kind of took a couple beats there, too.
[275:50.33]Could you do me a favor?
[275:51.73]Yeah, no problem.
[275:52.62]Did anyone here go to school for, like, game design?
[275:54.54]Oh, God.
[276:04.13]Are these guys friendly?
[276:05.57]Yeah.
[276:11.07]No, they're not.
[276:12.61]You lied to me!
[276:19.92]Okay, we all know what's going to happen here, so I'm just gonna mash and kill these guys real quick.
[276:28.79]You better not die, you... Okay, yeah, now, okay.
[276:31.49]Let's go, game design.
[276:36.33]Alright, hold on, I'll like save you the trouble.
[276:40.62]I think, are we losing items?
[276:43.02]I have no idea.
[276:45.10]Yeah, I definitely have less max health for sure.
[276:52.06]We're making steady progress, I'll call it.
[276:55.18]We went through the bone tunnel.
[276:59.28]I just wanna like, let's like, you know, speed run, you know what I'm saying?
[277:07.56]Fine, fuck it.
[277:08.02]Let's go.
[277:10.62]I'm going.
[277:16.39]Left turn.
[277:24.13]Oh shit, this looks like something.
[277:25.55]This looks important.
[277:29.15]I don't think it is.
[277:29.79]You sure?
[277:31.11]Oh, we kind of have the whole zone following us.
[277:36.95]No, no, we just came from that way.
[277:38.33]This way.
[277:39.81]You sure?
[277:40.21]This way.
[277:43.71]Everything looks the same.
[277:45.46]How do you know?
[277:47.04]We took a... Watch out, there's two spiders.
[277:50.72]And a golden goose.
[277:53.50]This way.
[277:54.40]That's a red guy.
[277:55.28]I haven't seen a red guy yet.
[277:56.81]We got invaded.
[277:57.33]There's two invaders.
[278:00.51]And like 30 spiders got in the run.
[278:02.27]Just keep running.
[278:02.99]Just keep running.
[278:03.67]Oh, Jesus.
[278:04.81]No, there's even more.
[278:05.71]No.
[278:06.09]What the fuck is this?
[278:12.22]How did we get through that?
[278:13.28]I don't know.
[278:14.14]This is dead end.
[278:15.06]Please tell me there's another, like, elevator.
[278:20.04]We're just playing tag.
[278:24.89]Dump that.
[278:30.99]Okay, let's keep going.
[278:32.85]I don't know where going is and keep that way.
[278:36.14]I do.
[278:36.82]Open the door.
[278:37.50]Open the door.
[278:37.98]It costs money, I think.
[278:39.60]Hold on.
[278:41.18]Kill the invader.
[278:48.95]What the?
[278:50.59]This is the most spider I've ever seen before.
[278:55.81]Okay, do you need health?
[278:57.69]No, I'm fine.
[278:59.32]Now I do.
[279:02.55]Now I need more health.
[279:04.17]How about you?
[279:04.53]Are you alright?
[279:05.51]No, I could use... No, no, don't.
[279:07.61]Wait, yeah, kill me.
[279:10.72]I'm gonna lose stamina, but I'm gonna gain health.
[279:15.08]Yeah, thanks.
[279:15.50]Alright, we found the entranceway.
[279:19.02]Okay.
[279:21.52]Boss.
[279:22.50]This is... Oh, I... A camel boss.
[279:24.44]Boss room.
[279:25.12]Smells like a boss room.
[279:26.78]Yep, this is gonna be an animal boss.
[279:38.96]We very awkwardly also can't, like, fight the same things.
[279:43.43]I picked up some essential oil.
[279:44.85]You have a bike that needs fixing?
[279:46.27]Animal boss.
[279:46.69]Mice!
[279:47.11]Mice!
[279:48.61]Mice?
[279:48.85]Very blind mice.
[279:51.91]God, you distracted me!
[279:52.83]What the heck, man?
[279:54.75]Shut up!
[279:56.11]Oh, man!
[279:57.17]Alright, who gets to heal the first person?
[279:58.79]Fuck you, dude.
[280:01.76]The boss was three spiders.
[280:04.30]No, the boss is in this room.
[280:06.90]So heal up.
[280:13.19]We're gonna beat this game.
[280:15.35]If we die, where do we go?
[280:16.35]Back to the checkpoint?
[280:17.89]Uh, the very beginning.
[280:19.80]Oh, jeez.
[280:20.26]Alright, well, let's kill the boss.
[280:22.08]Yep.
[280:22.48]This is a boss from if I've ever seen one.
[280:25.26]No.
[280:26.48]I heard one person saying, like, in a Steam review, that them and some friends played together, and when they got to an area that looked like the first boss, they beat it, and then the game was over.
[280:35.65]Oh.
[280:38.93]Oh.
[280:43.62]What about the two shield maidens?
[280:53.88]Behind you!
[280:59.35]Gosh.
[281:01.05]Gosh.
[281:01.73]Why are we fighting things?
[281:03.79]I don't know.
[281:04.77]Let's do the run strategy.
[281:07.37]I'm with you.
[281:07.77]I want that shield.
[281:08.93]Fuck, I can't pick up his tower shield.
[281:11.17]That's a big guy.
[281:11.83]Is that a boss?
[281:14.18]Yeah, boss.
[281:14.64]There's two bosses.
[281:15.28]Two bosses.
[281:16.22]Run.
[281:17.10]Run.
[281:17.34]Wait, let's not fight the bosses.
[281:18.98]Run.
[281:22.38]Gank.
[281:23.14]Gank.
[281:25.12]Gank.
[281:27.40]There's a chest.
[281:29.31]There's like spikes in front of the chest.
[281:30.59]Don't get it.
[281:31.45]Run away from the chest.
[281:32.09]There's a dead end.
[281:34.27]Oh god.
[281:36.29]I'm hiding.
[281:36.77]Time to fight.
[281:39.41]Hey, uh, can you heal me?
[281:41.19]If we sit in this corner, will we be able to heal?
[281:42.70]Uh, you need to heal me.
[281:49.62]How the fuck are you?
[281:51.32]It's just killed like this.
[281:53.25]What?
[281:53.53]Where are you?
[281:55.29]Why am, what happened?
[281:56.13]Why am I this guy?
[281:57.11]You're on the ground, Jerma.
[281:59.15]You're dead.
[281:59.61]I know, but like, why?
[282:08.43]Maybe if I tap A, I can resurrect.
[282:12.15]What the hell was that?
[282:15.71]He's walking on their heads.
[282:18.49]Damn, I wish I could see the funny thing.
[282:26.60]I got you.
[282:29.26]No, you don't.
[282:32.72]No, you don't.
[282:33.06]I teleported again.
[282:34.80]Wait, what?
[282:35.74]Yeah.
[282:36.84]Were you dead for too long?
[282:38.20]I just started resurrecting you.
[282:40.02]And I get a free chest.
[282:41.78]What?
[282:42.10]What?
[282:42.40]You, like, went through the wall with the resurrection or something.
[282:46.01]Well, thanks for the free stuff.
[282:49.03]As long as I had I had before.
[282:50.21]No, I think this is, like, the spawn room.
[282:51.45]You took too long.
[282:53.83]It's... No?
[282:57.13]Yeah, see?
[282:57.99]Like, I can see... You took too long, and I came back to where we were.
[283:04.13]Okay.
[283:05.30]So I have to make the elevator come up again.
[283:07.94]Really?
[283:21.17]Yeah.
[283:24.69]I'm in like hell over here.
[283:26.37]You're just like doing an 80's song thing.
[283:31.81]How do I get down here?
[283:38.07]Dude, there was just a fucking planet.
[283:40.65]What's this planet?
[283:41.75]I need to see what this is.
[283:43.45]Oh my god.
[283:44.79]I just see you falling.
[283:45.45]What the fuck?
[283:45.85]I can see the whole world.
[283:47.85]The whole world is at my fingertips.
[283:49.53]I can see where you are.
[283:55.05]This elevator takes so long.
[283:56.79]I can see the whole, like, map editor.
[284:01.10]It just takes some time... Jerma, I killed them all.
[284:09.64]Yeah, actually.
[284:13.56]That's... I'm so dead.
[284:16.62]Well, I can come heal you in a minute.
[284:17.68]I just have to wait for the elevator.
[284:20.20]It made me... Is this the elevator button?
[284:24.80]What the f... I'll get you.
[284:33.83]Where is this fucking elevator?
[284:37.45]Am I stupid?
[284:38.21]Please tell me if I am.
[284:39.39]Is the big blue crystal the elevator please come up call button?
[284:44.83]I can hear it.
[284:45.89]I can hear the elevator.
[284:47.80]What the?
[284:48.54]Where?
[284:48.94]Where?
[284:49.38]What the fuck was this?
[284:51.96]I'm coming.
[284:53.78]I'm coming.
[284:54.14]No, I'm going up.
[284:57.32]I'm going up.
[284:57.70]This is not the right way.
[284:59.12]I'm going up.
[285:07.33]Where's your body?
[285:09.39]How are you alive?
[285:10.35]I just respawned because I died.
[285:11.65]It's a long story.
[285:13.91]And I spawned in like the trail of enemies.
[285:20.46]Who's it talking to?
[285:21.04]Where are you?
[285:21.62]You're up top.
[285:22.48]What?
[285:27.44]I have no fucking idea.
[285:31.20]I guess we're done playing together.
[285:32.32]It's so much easier for me to die here.
[285:36.42]See?
[285:37.52]Okay, so I was on the right floor?
[285:39.80]This one requires 200 bucks!
[285:48.59]Oh my goodness.
[285:49.45]Alright, I'm coming.
[285:50.05]I have to just go this way.
[285:55.11]I don't know, dude.
[285:56.57]Do you have any idea what to do?
[286:00.08]I have no idea what to do.
[286:01.38]This is not the right way.
[286:03.68]I'm going up again.
[286:09.20]Where is this taking me?
[286:10.04]Is this taking me back, like, the long way?
[286:11.56]What is this giant crystal?
[286:16.70]I think we're both seeing equally interesting things on our own.
[286:19.45]Yeah, I... I want to show you something, like, when this stream's over.
[286:23.03]I found, like, a tutorial room.
[286:26.27]A what?
[286:26.53]I don't know, there's, like, a big crystal in here.
[286:29.81]I found the Naru.
[286:31.63]Great job.
[286:32.51]Um, my friend... Okay, cool.
[286:37.30]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[286:42.09]How do I get back to my friend?
[286:44.79]I remember this place, the ladder.
[286:46.06]If I, like, hold X, do I teleport to here?
[286:48.74]Jerma!
[286:48.86]Jerma!
[286:49.76]My god, I know exactly where you are and where exactly you have to go, but I don't know how to tell you.
[286:54.14]Honestly, here's the problem.
[286:55.60]There's a hole in the floor, and it's the elevator, and you have to go down that elevator.
[286:59.07]Go down the elevator?
[287:00.07]Yes.
[287:00.61]Go down the elevator?
[287:01.69]Go down the elevator.
[287:02.65]You want me to go down this elevator?
[287:04.53]Yes.
[287:05.75]The elevator that only goes up?
[287:07.57]No, you have to interact with the crystal, then it comes back up.
[287:10.51]Damn it.
[287:12.02]Dude, give me a little bit of slack.
[287:13.54]We sprinted through the whole fucking game so far.
[287:17.28]There's nothing for me to remember.
[287:18.58]All I remember is running straight and left and right.
[287:23.52]Ah, thank God.
[287:25.31]Took you fucking long enough.
[287:29.87]Karma has no concept of space or time.
[287:31.65]No, I don't.
[287:32.29]When you... There's no mini-map and you sprint through a whole level.
[287:36.49]It was really simple.
[287:39.37]Oh, would you just shut it?
[287:40.39]I can see you right now.
[287:41.55]Look at that bad gamer over there, not even fucking up the last boss over that way.
[287:48.28]The problem is that you're still playing this game.
[287:53.62]Talking about space and time though, I don't remember how to get back to where you're coming down.
[287:59.14]That's what I'm saying.
[287:59.98]I have no idea.
[288:01.69]All I remember is running as fast as we could.
[288:03.57]You have to be down.
[288:05.03]You're down now.
[288:05.73]I can see you through the walls, but I don't know how to get back there.
[288:09.19]I can open this door.
[288:10.25]I'm going to have to run through everything again, aren't I?
[288:12.83]Yeah.
[288:16.42]Hold on, wait.
[288:18.72]Is there a shortcut?
[288:19.34]Do I just go that way?
[288:22.50]I'm just going to fucking die here again.
[288:24.80]There's no way I'm going to make it out alive.
[288:26.50]I think I'm almost at you.
[288:28.02]Is there- do you see the big Statue of Liberty?
[288:29.98]No, I'm- I see your name through the walls.
[288:31.44]Go to the Statue of Liberty.
[288:35.34]What am I doing?!
[288:36.24]You're running away from me, I think.
[288:41.26]Give me that item!
[288:41.96]There's, like, a fucking- Watch the traps!
[288:49.27]Wait, are you behind me?
[288:50.73]Yes!
[288:52.61]You- wait, you're actually, like, in that room with the Statue of Liberty?
[288:55.19]YES!
[288:56.67]Alright, well, I'm that's how I said watch for the trap your stream sniping me Okay, mob them up mob them up.
[289:08.51]We're gonna farm some XP mob them up.
[289:10.29]I have no help.
[289:12.37]He's gonna get us killed Okay, come with me Jesus Jesus Mob them up dude.
[289:21.93]You fucking had the right idea.
[289:23.27]Hey watch out for Blackbeard.
[289:24.25]Oh
[289:26.09]Dude, that's like Mr. T. It's a guy with like a mohawk and a beard.
[289:31.09]I just have to kill like a whole nother... Alright, well get ready because here comes the Mr. T enemy.
[289:40.06]I... Oh, just speedrun.
[289:46.46]I'll keep going back.
[289:51.46]Oh shit, this is where we came from, isn't it?
[289:53.46]This is what I told you.
[289:56.91]That's what I've been telling you.
[289:58.17]This whole time.
[289:59.71]I was doing fine without you.
[290:03.43]There's a chest.
[290:03.98]You killed me.
[290:13.10]You killed me and then you died.
[290:18.16]It's up to you.
[290:18.74]This is the game you wanted to play.
[290:19.87]It's up to you.
[290:33.74]It just feels so slow.
[290:35.50]Like, I don't want to fight anything.
[290:37.58]It's not fun to fight things.
[290:39.72]Hey, I have one all-time item smashed.
[290:45.88]And fighting things is the whole game.
[290:47.72]I'm doing one more.
[290:53.93]Maybe it's our characters.
[290:55.07]I want to do one more so that we, like, can't possibly refund it.
[290:59.67]I think we have to be the same character.
[291:03.77]I already started, let's go.
[291:06.66]I'll be the son, you'll be the daughter.
[291:07.76]We get like a plus 10% health bonus for being the same faction.
[291:15.40]Okay, get on the elevator, get on the elevator.
[291:35.11]Let's kill, like, the skeletons that drop 10 gems.
[291:39.77]Before I get restored, I am so busted.
[291:43.51]I can see about 5% of my screen right now.
[291:46.30]Why is a benevolent lord person talking about getting, like, busted by his parents?
[291:50.62]Oh, no.
[291:52.34]I'm so busted.
[291:59.68]God with a hut guiding you.
[292:01.26]Got it.
[292:07.66]Oh, nice dead end.
[292:08.84]Oh, nice deados.
[292:18.96]Let me get this guy.
[292:19.66]Let me get him with a back step.
[292:23.62]Ah, fuck!
[292:24.38]Dude, I must have heard the footsteps.
[292:30.40]I must have.
[292:32.82]Animal boss, hippo.
[292:34.91]First it was the camo boss.
[292:36.72]Now we're in the hippo bosses area.
[292:38.98]Oh shit, is this hippo bosses?
[292:41.14]We're gonna start seeing different water and jungle themed enemies.
[292:46.60]This is the hippo campus.
[292:48.40]This is the boss's name.
[292:49.56]Hippo campus.
[292:52.60]Cool.
[292:53.27]Oh, this is a hippo.
[292:53.95]I didn't even see the hippo.
[292:54.99]Now I see the hippo.
[293:00.91]Ow.
[293:01.31]Watch out for the spikes, dude.
[293:07.55]I got an unknown potion.
[293:09.56]I got a potion of vigor.
[293:12.18]Watch out for the trap.
[293:14.68]Watch out for the moon spiders.
[293:17.68]The moon.
[293:20.48]Make sure you eat food of the arcane variety and you collect creatures droppings.
[293:25.71]Every time you kill an enemy, just cover the screen up.
[293:29.19]Can I get some moons in the chat, please?
[293:31.93]Watch out, we got invaders.
[293:32.63]Give me some moons in both chats.
[293:39.85]I want, like, Starz mods to be fucking pissed off.
[293:42.81]My mods gave up a long time ago.
[293:52.28]If we tell- I feel like if we tell everyone what the other game is... They're gonna be like, get out of this now.
[293:57.94]Yeah, they're gonna say, like, leave.
[293:59.66]Just stop.
[294:02.21]Well, who knows?
[294:02.83]The other game- God, dude, come on.
[294:05.29]Heal me.
[294:06.80]I want a heal from your overhand smash in my head.
[294:16.97]That's for the sub only?
[294:19.77]But, like, my subs are... We share a lot of subs.
[294:22.38]There's still a lot of moons.
[294:24.25]To be fair, it didn't stop anything.
[294:26.17]Sub only.
[294:27.77]Alright, in that case, I'm going to have you put up the jermaMoon on your chat too.
[294:33.71]Like you upload it to Twitch as well.
[294:35.67]So we both have the same email.
[294:37.71]Even when you do have it in sub mode, they can just still fucking do it.
[294:44.23]Let me get this guy.
[294:48.74]You get this one though.
[294:53.41]You just killed the old man in a tree.
[294:57.73]Think I wanted to wait here for a thousand years.
[295:02.51]You just killed the old man in a tree.
[295:06.24]What?
[295:06.44]Shut up.
[295:08.82]Oh!
[295:09.14]There's the boss!
[295:11.24]I wanna kill this thing.
[295:21.82]Okay, that is the strategy.
[295:23.30]You get them all to chase you, and then I can hit them all in the back for free.
[295:29.28]Not when he does the fucking sphincter move.
[295:32.31]I mean spin, no.
[295:33.27]Why did I say sphincter?
[295:36.11]Ah, shit, dude.
[295:36.95]I'm low on HP.
[295:39.29]Intense, intense fucking game right here.
[295:41.49]Intense, okay.
[295:43.78]Big boss didn't even drop anything.
[295:45.74]Don't!
[295:46.48]I'm not low on HP.
[295:48.16]Oh, I thought that's just what we do.
[295:49.58]We, like, refresh.
[295:54.29]Actually, I... At this point, because I... Yeah, just do it.
[295:58.93]Just kill me.
[296:06.06]Thanks a lot, dude.
[296:06.56]Welcome to the old man in the tree.
[296:08.72]Also, once you start doing that, like, spin with this weapon... Yeah.
[296:13.18]You can't, like, turn at all.
[296:15.46]Oh, okay.
[296:16.22]It's a little different than I thought it was.
[296:18.33]Free shit.
[296:21.97]Oh, watch out for this guy.
[296:22.99]The bearded guy.
[296:25.78]Who has a very different attack pattern than the skeletons.
[296:28.50]Than the every other thing.
[296:29.38]Uh-oh.
[296:37.18]Does that mean that the ceiling caves in eventually or something?
[296:42.26]Yeah, the ceiling comes down and then...
[296:51.13]Yeah.
[296:51.31]Attack pattern.
[296:51.97]Here he goes.
[296:52.53]Big smash.
[296:53.77]Dash around the side.
[296:54.59]Ooh.
[296:56.33]You think I could do, like, a YouTube tutorial about that?
[296:58.95]Yeah, I think you should.
[297:00.21]Okay, guys.
[297:00.63]So what happens here is when he raises his hand up, you want to dash to the left.
[297:03.91]And that's going to get you behind him, allowing for two or three different attack patterns.
[297:09.82]Once you clear him out, he's cleared out for good.
[297:12.94]And then it cuts to, like, another fucking cool tutorial.
[297:18.72]Stop trying to kill me.
[297:22.88]What's with this red beam?
[297:26.18]Oh!
[297:26.98]It's got me!
[297:27.64]Dude, you walked into the trap, man.
[297:29.71]Watch out!
[297:36.33]How'd you do that fucking move?
[297:37.61]Cool!
[297:38.73]Dude, I'm just trying to, like, you know what I'm saying?
[297:40.77]Hey, you know what?
[297:42.02]Can I get this guy a fucking full heal, please?

[298:17.86]number nine number nine the camel boss camel boss the two hump mechanic where you have to hit the two humps what an odd mechanic that's why it's number nine
[298:32.23]Clocking in at number eight on our Wheel of Fortune, so to speak.
[298:35.29]Don't die.
[298:35.49]Don't die.
[298:35.81]If you die, this game... No, if you die, it's game over and we're done.
[298:40.23]This is serious business now.
[298:41.47]You can't die.
[298:42.17]You have to be able to beat these guys.
[298:43.23]Clocking in at number seven.
[298:44.75]The Three Twins.
[298:46.43]The Three Twins is one of my favorite fights of the entire series.
[298:50.05]The mechanic where you have to resurrect your friend.
[298:52.63]No!
[298:53.15]No!
[298:53.51]Just fight them!
[298:59.87]We're playing BattleBots.
[299:07.88]BattleBots is the other game.
[299:09.64]You build robots and mean Jerm or you fight.
[299:12.46]Yeah, we're gonna play BattleBots with each other.
[299:19.12]Gonna be fun.
[299:22.41]Clocking in at number six.
[299:25.83]God damn it.
[299:30.84]Necropolis.
[299:31.36]Okay, what's my playtime in Necropolis?
[299:34.12]Oh, we did it.
[299:35.88]Did we do it?
[299:36.48]Chat, 56 minutes played.
[299:39.22]What does that mean?
[299:41.66]That means refund.
[299:49.67]Clocking in at number five.
[299:52.21]The Steam refund page.
[299:56.22]Getting to this point was very difficult.
[299:59.04]And it proved to be the harder of the middle-of-the-road bosses in the Souls games.
[300:10.63]Okay, let's open Battle Boss.
[300:12.75]It's probably going to be really loud.
[300:14.79]It's going to be very loud.
[300:15.49]So how about you, like, you ruin your stream and then tell me how much you ruined it and I'll... So are you just, like, turning off your stream?
[300:24.57]Oh.
[300:27.57]Are you going to play anything after BattleBots?
[300:31.25]I don't know.
[300:32.83]It depends on how long we play BattleBots.
[300:35.09]I can't imagine it being more than an hour or two.
[300:40.42]I don't know.
[300:40.68]I guess I'll just... Just stream it.
[300:44.50]There's no reason for you to turn off your stream right now.
[300:52.38]Because if you end up going and I don't or vice versa, it doesn't matter.
[300:57.97]So, let's like figure out how do we play this game together.
[301:06.64]It does not have a 1920 by 1080 option.
[301:11.12]After a great start.
[301:13.47]I'm gonna change my like Steam what you're playing list.
[301:20.03]Wait, it does.
[301:22.11]Just it doesn't have one for the windowed version.
[301:24.13]That's weird.
[301:27.29]uh what's it called robot robot arena 3. it actually has a
[301:55.88]Oh my god, mute your- like an OBS mute when you open this game.
[302:20.27]I haven't done it one on my- on my volume mixer and it's still loud.
[302:26.39]Yes, you should say- AHHHHHH!
[302:36.36]Dude, my ears seriously still hurt, like, for the first time ever on Twitch, I feel like everyone is justified in what they're saying, and I'm so sorry.
[302:57.54]That was really the most genuine I Got Stab sound I've ever made.
[303:10.92]Not only is it loud, it's like fucking hard metal.
[303:32.06]Seriously, my ears are, like, ringing.
[303:36.61]That also gave me the classic drama instant headache.
[303:51.71]I had music playing as well for, like, the downtime.
[303:55.06]At 1% volume, I can't even hear that.
[303:56.82]Okay.
[304:02.14]Okay, so.
[304:04.42]What the fuck is this?
[304:05.30]Create?
[304:06.66]Choose a logo for your team?
[304:14.40]Is there more?
[304:15.89]There is more.
[304:17.53]Oh, definitely the spooky fucking green ghost.
[304:21.27]I just need to pick quickly so I can get to it.
[304:27.97]I got my shit ready.
[304:35.48]Yeah, we're going to go with Rancid.
[304:37.78]Hey, what's your team name?
[304:41.06]Mine's Rancid.
[304:43.20]Mine was Ster.
[304:46.36]Find games online or create your own and invite your friends.
[304:48.82]I think that's what we're doing, right?
[304:49.79]Do you want to add me or what?
[304:52.55]I don't know.
[304:53.01]You figure out how to invite me.
[304:54.31]This is on you.
[304:55.05]Alright.
[304:58.53]Oh, fuck.
[304:58.95]Whoops.
[304:59.98]Greenspy gave me money.
[305:01.30]It says this is for Jerma.
[305:02.90]Since I can't give it to him, let him know I'm never getting to you.
[305:07.92]Wait, don't you still owe me like $300 or something?
[305:11.62]What?
[305:12.18]Since when?
[305:12.60]I can't remember what it was for.
[305:16.00]I guess you don't.
[305:26.84]I swear you do, though.
[305:30.43]We'll figure that out, I don't know.
[305:31.81]Alright, see if I can invite you.
[305:33.87]Alright, did you get it?
[305:38.98]Did you get it?
[305:43.76]I clicked it, nothing happened.
[305:46.98]Nothing happened.
[305:47.80]Nothing happened.
[305:50.45]Really?
[305:50.75]Try it again.
[305:52.63]Nothing happened.
[306:02.53]How about you try inviting me?
[306:04.09]Right, so I go to online.
[306:06.14]I see... He went on a three-week video game bender that's costing his health, job, and wife.
[306:12.48]Well, I backed out because you said it didn't work, so now you just invite me.
[306:15.26]Oh, my God.
[306:15.58]No, you do the same thing you just did because you already know how to do it.
[306:18.96]You just go to online and then go to create.
[306:21.49]That's it.
[306:23.43]Just name your server or something, whatever.
[306:24.87]FrogDog.
[306:26.45]Yeah, FrogDog.
[306:28.17]Weight class, heavy.
[306:30.15]Unrestricted.
[306:32.61]So now you send me an invitation.
[306:34.35]Wait, no, here's the problem.
[306:35.39]No, no, no, here's the problem.
[306:37.19]What?
[306:37.45]We haven't made any bots yet.
[306:40.11]I think we like... Oh!
[306:45.53]Okay.
[306:47.93]I see what you're saying.
[306:48.85]Well, let's just find out... So am I inviting you or no?
[306:51.49]Yeah, just invite me.
[306:56.31]Send me an e-byte.
[307:02.72]Okay, Darren.
[307:04.16]Let's see what happens.
[307:13.18]Okay.
[307:13.62]You know what really had me laughing the other day?
[307:15.46]What?
[307:16.50]A day ago, I started bursting out laughing.
[307:19.54]That guy's head at Denny's was so small.
[307:23.16]You're still on that, huh?
[307:25.14]Alright.
[307:30.27]I guess we're... We have to pick a bot.
[307:38.78]Okay, select bot.
[307:41.36]Alright, so we can make our own bots, but... I mean, this is the pre-stream.
[307:51.15]You said you know the one I'm going to pick?
[307:53.11]Yeah.
[307:55.69]See if you're right.
[307:59.66]Definitely this one.
[308:00.96]Let's see if you're correct.
[308:02.12]This hardcore metal in the background also is just... We're gonna go to the soccer field.
[308:21.96]You haven't picked a bot yet.
[308:23.06]Yes I did.
[308:29.38]Oh, I can't see your bot, I guess.
[308:32.02]Pick the arena.
[308:34.62]I have no idea how to play this game.
[308:36.96]I have no idea how... I'm not picking an arena.
[308:39.68]I clicked ready at the bottom right.
[308:42.30]So did I. It says... What?
[308:46.66]What?
[308:47.10]Did you pick the soccer field or what?
[308:49.44]What are we talking about?
[308:51.58]Under select arena.
[308:52.78]There's no... Oh.
[308:56.36]Oh!
[308:56.46]What are you talking about?
[308:58.42]I thought... You thought.
[309:04.01]This is just gonna be a basic one.
[309:06.37]I thought the top thing was your bot.
[309:10.89]No.
[309:11.83]I thought, because... Okay.
[309:12.75]Alright, I don't know how to, like, fight.
[309:15.70]I'm sure we'll figure that out.
[309:16.58]Alright, you ready?
[309:22.11]You picked the one that I thought you would.
[309:23.95]I did.
[309:24.19]Alright, well, you're going down.
[309:26.11]After this, we'll make our own bugs.
[309:27.63]Yeah.
[309:28.03]This is just kind of like the learn what the game is battle.
[309:30.58]Yeah.
[309:35.02]Oh my god.
[309:36.18]Oh my god.
[309:39.04]How do you, like, change the camera?
[309:43.84]Oh, I'm kicking your ass right now.
[309:45.88]I can't drive in a straight line.
[309:47.50]This thing is awful.
[309:49.67]By the way, there's like more dumb music in the background.
[309:55.27]I think I win.
[310:01.90]Good match!
[310:02.68]Alright, let's go make bots.
[310:05.86]Yeah, let's go make a bot.
[310:07.84]Let's go make a bot.
[310:09.76]I'll go to the bot labs.
[310:10.42]Let's go to the settings.
[310:11.56]Create bot.
[310:12.16]I don't... How am I supposed to know what these are?
[310:16.90]Which one is music?
[310:19.15]Go to the plot labs.
[310:20.21]Okay, that's definitely music.
[310:21.33]Alright, hold on.
[310:22.21]Let me turn my volume back.
[310:23.97]You can adjust the audio.
[310:31.05]That's definitely music, right?
[310:32.30]It has to be.
[310:35.50]Oh, God, it's over here.
[310:36.34]Okay.
[310:38.70]This is too complicated.
[310:41.12]It's too complicated?
[310:44.08]Create, why is it... Oh, Jesus, I think I know what you mean.
[310:46.32]Build?
[310:47.34]What am I even doing?
[310:50.88]I'm testing mine.
[310:52.26]Oh, fuck.
[310:55.70]Huh?
[310:56.80]The test failed.
[311:00.94]Okay, I don't understand.
[311:03.44]What?
[311:05.21]Okay, build.
[311:05.85]Components.
[311:07.43]This is so complicated, you're right.
[311:09.11]Wheels.
[311:11.65]Cat.
[311:11.99]Oh, I think I get it.
[311:13.41]I'm starting to understand.
[311:15.07]I didn't think that this was going to be this weird.
[311:22.26]Okay, middle.
[311:25.40]I'm just making a shelf, is all I'm doing.
[311:30.02]I'm just... Okay, let's see.
[311:35.92]I gotta get a test here, too.
[311:39.25]Uh... Save it.
[311:44.45]No.
[311:46.59]It's big!
[311:51.16]Uh, okay, I got my art class shape.
[311:58.05]Let's paint it up.
[311:59.39]Paint shop.
[312:02.53]We're such fucking idiots.
[312:03.99]What, how do I... Uh, red, uh, blue, and red, no, blue.
[312:09.99]Okay, got it.
[312:12.03]Bleed purple.
[312:12.63]twitch.tv, bleed purple.
[312:15.85]Okay, I know what I'm doing.
[312:20.99]He went on a three-week video game bender that cost him his health, job, and wife.
[312:25.54]Let's get another camera angle.
[312:26.74]Oh, yeah.
[312:29.56]Don't tell Jerma.
[312:32.26]Strat.
[312:38.25]Okay, how do I go back?
[312:46.95]How do you put wheels on?
[312:48.80]No, not like the Steam Workshop.
[312:54.72]I made something really cool.
[312:56.36]I'm ready.
[312:56.80]I am not fucking ready.
[312:59.34]I'm not even close.
[313:06.24]I think I'm gonna do pretty well.
[313:10.60]How do I even put this on?
[313:15.82]Oh my god, this is not a game.
[313:17.46]This is not a game.
[313:19.40]Controls?
[313:20.12]I don't know.
[313:26.69]Uh... Let's go with... Let's go with dickhead.
[313:30.79]I'm just gonna fucking... What?
[313:41.23]Okay, I'm gonna... Not power steering, I guess.
[313:48.07]I think you have to restart the game.
[313:53.29]Restart the game?
[313:54.03]Why?
[313:54.25]Hold on, I'm not talking to you.
[313:56.82]I think you have to restart the game to download the bots that I made.
[314:01.98]These bots are so small.
[314:04.10]No, there's a wheel inside.
[314:05.26]Fuck.
[314:10.81]We should have figured out how to play this game before we did this.
[314:13.59]No.
[314:14.43]No, we shouldn't have.
[314:16.31]A little bit of it.
[314:17.79]I got an idea.
[314:19.27]I see.
[314:21.45]Yeah, look at that.
[314:22.09]Look at this.
[314:23.25]No, no, no.
[314:24.29]Okay, let's go back to...
[314:30.61]Try and build our own.
[314:35.47]No attachments?
[314:36.15]What the fuck is he talking about?
[314:37.27]This is so complicated.
[314:41.35]How do you, like, attach a weapon?
[314:43.42]I don't know.
[314:46.36]Build?
[314:46.68]Go to components.
[314:48.38]Go to weapons.
[314:50.92]Weapons?
[314:52.80]Alright, well, so how do I, like, put a weapon on here?
[314:56.10]No attachments are available for this component.
[314:58.17]Why not?
[315:02.82]Mechanics, right?
[315:06.20]Mounts?
[315:06.77]Connectors?
[315:07.81]There's like controls that you have to set up and everything.
[315:12.85]How do I even fucking move this shit?
[315:20.68]Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[315:23.52]Okay.
[315:24.88]You're gonna have to... Alright, so if you go to mounts and connectors, that's like how you put shit on.
[315:33.54]Sort of.
[315:33.92]I just had an epiphany.
[315:51.21]Wait, hold on.
[315:54.55]I made like a can opener.
[315:56.75]That's all I did.
[315:57.79]You just put this can opener on your fucking desktop and you can open up any can you want.
[316:02.58]I don't understand how to... You get it to go to the middle.
[316:08.22]Because you have to put things on the middle and then it... It keeps... Please.
[316:15.13]Please stay in the middle!
[316:19.17]Mom!
[316:19.61]Mom.
[316:24.63]Oh wait, what the fuck?
[316:26.00]There you go, power steering.
[316:28.70]I gotta like move this.
[316:31.39]How do you, like, move shit?
[316:38.44]What are you doing?
[316:42.90]Oh, okay.
[316:43.16]Hold on.
[316:43.42]There we go.
[316:45.04]Ooh.
[316:45.16]Okay.
[316:50.85]Great.
[316:51.93]I'm making progress.
[316:52.79]I don't know about you.
[316:54.57]I'm making barely any progress.
[317:02.13]It's sideways.
[317:03.03]You need a motor.
[317:08.20]How do you... Wheels.
[317:17.96]I don't think this is the right... Let's just... Let's test it.
[317:20.75]I don't understand.
[317:22.03]I need, like, an engine.
[317:24.84]How do I like flip this and put it on the bottom as a connector?
[317:29.26]It's like always on the bottom layer and always facing the wrong way.
[317:35.42]Oh, you have to place it first.
[317:38.75]Then it's... Is this upside down?
[317:47.29]I'm pretty sure my bot was upside down.
[317:54.97]Delete this.
[317:55.57]Get rid of this fucking thing.
[318:02.29]Hey, how do I delete?
[318:03.31]There we go.
[318:05.63]I'm gonna delete this random fucking tire in the middle.
[318:09.65]So this is the front.
[318:11.04]Okay, hold on a second.
[318:17.76]There we are.
[318:18.30]I like that.
[318:21.40]I'm starting to understand a little bit
[318:24.42]I am too.
[318:26.18]Getting there.
[318:26.66]I've got wheels now.
[318:33.81]Why is there a fucking one underneath me?
[318:40.85]This is really gonna pay off when we get to battle each other for ten seconds.
[318:45.27]What is this even here for?
[318:48.66]Why do I have a fucking giant knife on the bottom?
[318:51.70]Let's try that.
[318:54.77]Where is the test?
[318:55.83]There we are.
[319:03.25]It doesn't drive.
[319:04.05]God damn it.
[319:19.02]I think I'm gonna win.
[319:23.46]Honestly.
[319:25.18]I don't think you have a chance.
[319:28.06]This would be so dumb.
[319:37.30]It didn't, hey, at least it didn't flip this time.
[319:39.02]That's right.
[319:46.84]Wait, then you go to, what was it?
[319:48.56]There's circuit boards and everything?
[319:56.34]Because you need your bot to have, like, power.
[319:59.38]How's your build going?
[320:01.00]I don't understand how you can only place objects on, like, the bottom layer.
[320:06.45]How do you bring the layer up where you're placing things?
[320:11.69]That's what I'm stuck with.
[320:12.51]The birthday cake bot.
[320:25.87]Get that there.
[320:30.92]Did I bring like the engine up or something?
[320:32.44]I'm gonna go like this.
[320:34.86]Maybe it's like just not supposed to be here.
[320:43.21]The battery's just... My game's freaking out.
[320:48.36]Give it a little bit more balance.
[320:52.10]I don't want him to get a clue on what's coming his way.
[320:55.46]The real payoff is when Jerma gets to finally see mine.
[321:01.21]Yeah, I don't know where Ster went.
[321:02.31]Ster muted.
[321:02.85]I don't want you stealing my secrets.
[321:06.33]Oh, okay.
[321:07.11]There's one thing I'm stuck on.
[321:08.91]How do you not build on the bottom layer?
[321:12.55]Like the blue blueprint is always at the bottom.
[321:19.73]Ooh!
[321:20.19]He doesn't know either, apparently.
[321:21.03]Can't figure it out.
[321:25.87]Need a mount.
[321:26.41]Jesus.
[321:26.81]I need a connector.
[321:29.17]Does that mean I can actually drive the fucking thing?
[321:35.30]Doesn't do anything.
[321:35.80]Okay, good.
[321:37.98]Turn snap off.
[321:39.18]This thing fucking flies!
[321:43.78]Okay, don't tell him my secrets, guys.
[321:45.52]How did you...
[321:48.67]Now I just need to make it so it's able to turn left and right.
[321:53.05]Up and down doesn't work.
[321:56.89]Don't you just want, like, your front tires to turn?
[321:58.83]I want to not place on the bottom level.
[322:04.37]I want to, like, put something on top of my robot.
[322:06.57]How do I do that?
[322:09.40]Uh, I think you have to go to, like, the layer?
[322:12.18]It never stays on what layer that I choose.
[322:15.17]Maybe you can't, I don't know.
[322:17.99]Yeah, you can't build, yeah, you can't.
[322:20.59]Well, it's okay, you're fucking going to, you're going to die.
[322:23.71]In real life, has low self-esteem, you know, socially very awkward, but yet in the game, they become a great warrior.
[322:32.00]Thanks for bearing with me.
[322:33.38]I think we can do a little test here.
[322:37.25]Wait, you're ready?
[322:38.31]I think I'm ready to fight you.
[322:39.65]You're ready to fight me?
[322:41.13]In like another, maybe one minute.
[322:45.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[322:46.93]I think people just helped me with a breakthrough.
[322:56.40]Control?
[322:56.96]Control's not doing anything.
[322:57.90]Control's not doing anything.
[323:02.34]Okay, I gotta bring that out.
[323:03.88]So as we were talking about with the layers...
[323:08.78]What the fuck?
[323:09.74]Get out there.
[323:10.32]Hold on.
[323:15.01]Turn off snapping.
[323:15.83]Maybe that's like a problem.
[323:20.29]Battleaxe.
[323:24.29]Am I scrolling?
[323:29.95]At this point, I'm just trying every button.
[323:31.87]That's fine.
[323:32.35]I'm good to go.
[323:32.87]That scroll does.
[323:34.29]Control isn't doing anything.
[323:35.53]Maybe it's right control.
[323:42.35]Vendors there we go.
[323:43.49]That's what I'm looking for.
[323:44.52]You have to place it first.
[323:45.62]That's what I'm looking for guys.
[323:47.64]Oh boy Say your fine figure it out.
[323:50.74]I figured out when you place something Maybe you figured this out when you play something the double arrows up and down move it you can't place something on top of your robot Until it's already been placed on the bottom of it Pretty ingenious
[324:14.10]Well, it was nice knowing you, dude.
[324:16.68]Okay, hold on.
[324:25.27]We don't need any of this anymore.
[324:29.29]Soul still isn't doing anything, by the way.
[324:40.70]Give me a weapon.
[324:41.50]I need a weapon.
[324:50.00]Yeah.
[324:51.32]You think you have a strategy?
[324:52.46]I have a strategy too.
[324:53.98]I'm glad we both have strategies.
[325:03.99]I'm glad you have strategy, because mine's probably going to be better than yours.
[325:06.45]Okay.
[325:07.97]I don't understand this either.
[325:18.56]Are we ready to just go?
[325:19.75]This is getting ridiculous.
[325:20.97]Hey, Jarva, are you ready to go?
[325:24.46]This is just getting ridiculous.
[325:47.61]I guess not.
[325:48.27]I guess Jerm is not ready.
[325:53.99]Oh, it's because you can, like, choose what material... Okay, this is choosing the whole material, my whole thing.
[325:59.29]You can see the mass at the top where it's changing.
[326:02.35]Cardboard is not... We want titanium.
[326:09.71]Yeah, we want titanium.
[326:16.69]And we want...
[326:21.24]A motor.
[326:28.33]For some reason, I think we need a motor in here.
[326:37.55]And then I think we need a... Another motor.
[326:44.80]And then I think we need... A motor.
[326:52.23]So we're increasing mass.
[326:54.57]And then we're going to want some power.
[327:00.76]More control batteries.
[327:01.96]Put some batteries down here.
[327:03.82]I want some pistons.
[327:13.76]So my robot blew up on the table and crashed the game.
[327:17.28]The game broke.
[327:17.84]I have to reach out the whole game.
[327:19.20]The whole game.
[327:25.10]Just in case you were curious.
[327:27.06]I was curious.
[327:27.74]Let me test mine just in case.
[327:30.04]Oh god, mute!
[327:30.96]Turn the volume down!
[327:31.62]Turn the volume down, guys!
[327:32.36]Quick, turn the volume down!
[327:33.22]Turn your volume down!
[327:35.77]Okay, no no, thank god it's saved.
[327:37.55]You're good, you're safe.
[327:38.97]Okay.
[327:41.05]I thought that when you restart the game, it does what some games do and just reverts back all the settings.
[327:46.78]That was insane.
[327:47.80]I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be, Jeremy.
[327:49.90]I don't know if you heard what I was saying to you.
[327:52.78]Yeah, I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be.
[327:54.99]We should just, like, do this, because... I lost everything.
[328:00.93]My game decided that the robot was not good enough, and it blew it up, and I couldn't leave the game.
[328:05.09]I win.
[328:06.25]No, you won.
[328:08.91]Sorry, I know exactly what I need to do now, and it's gonna take me, like, less than a minute.
[328:12.61]Okay.
[328:15.76]I just need to be able to drive the car.
[328:19.55]I might as well work on mine a little bit more.
[328:22.15]You're done for, by the way.
[328:25.31]No, I'm not.
[328:27.57]I don't think you understand what my... You have a strategy, I have a strategy too that's probably a lot better than your strategy, we'll just say.
[328:35.32]Oh, we'll just say my strategy is better.
[328:37.74]You don't even know.
[328:39.30]I don't think you understand.
[328:40.04]I'm making a shower for you.
[328:44.93]You think you're like a big boy.
[328:56.01]Wait, no.
[328:56.45]I want a fat boy.
[329:07.06]You gotta have the bumper there.
[329:08.42]Yeah, this needs to be bigger.
[329:11.75]Actually, okay, if anything's gonna like break my game.
[329:14.45]It's actually kind of like fun just to sit here and do this.
[329:21.41]Oh, what the hell?
[329:22.43]Where is it?
[329:23.33]How am I steering?
[329:24.74]Wide.
[329:27.42]Keep adding wheels.
[329:28.76]There we go.
[329:29.34]Now those wheels will bump.
[329:32.76]That way we can roll around a little bit better.
[329:38.27]Okay.
[329:39.91]Getting there.
[329:40.31]Okay, let's test that.
[329:43.83]Alright.
[329:44.57]So now I just have to do this last thing.
[329:50.27]Okay, see that was smart because now it's a little bit more stable.
[329:52.78]We got the pink on the top for some reason.
[329:54.62]Every time we enter an arena, the color changes.
[329:58.28]This is the front, right?
[329:59.64]Okay.
[330:02.52]Getting somewhere.
[330:09.99]We're almost done.
[330:16.65]No, it's not going to let me do that.
[330:17.69]So I have to do it like here.
[330:25.22]Tiny little bleed.
[330:28.42]Not.
[330:31.15]Here we go.
[330:31.51]What I wanted.
[330:32.65]Weapons.
[330:34.69]Get them on there.
[330:41.19]Good fucking luck.
[330:44.77]Now we just need some... We need some weight.
[330:49.67]And I'll be good to go.
[330:55.98]Put like a couple of fucking weights back here.
[330:58.26]Or just like one maybe.
[330:59.12]It'll be like alright.
[331:02.76]This was a bad idea.
[331:05.36]Everything we wanted to do today was just a bad idea.
[331:13.05]Good fucking luck It's not well, it is hold on not done I'm having a great old time because you don't understand the fact that you're never gonna be able to touch me We're getting somewhere
[331:49.32]Okay, it's going to be test bot two.
[331:51.52]Sure.
[331:56.69]Now we're getting somewhere.
[331:57.81]This is the front, right?
[332:07.11]Accelerate, deaccelerate.
[332:11.73]Steer left, steer right.
[332:13.33]Okay.
[332:16.03]We're not going to have to worry about steering, guys.
[332:19.27]Not at all.
[332:24.27]Wait, what?
[332:25.91]I think I crashed my game.
[332:29.11]I think it's my turn now.
[332:30.33]I think I crashed my game.
[332:32.61]Yeah, it happens.
[332:37.45]Yeah, I can't click on anything.
[332:39.74]Yep.
[332:40.82]Hopefully you saved it.
[332:42.32]I did.
[332:42.60]Give that another try.
[332:47.40]I need another motor.
[332:49.07]Okay, so every time you have a new weapon, you need a new motor for that weapon.
[332:53.17]You're curious about that.
[332:54.83]Okay.
[332:54.95]What the fuck is that?
[333:17.35]I hear you giggling.
[333:18.67]No wonder this didn't work.
[333:23.63]We just gotta go backwards.
[333:26.25]We just gotta go like this.
[333:28.09]No, I can't even do anything.
[333:29.51]He will never touch us.
[333:32.02]He will never win.
[333:33.68]Oh, shit.
[333:36.12]My game's just broken again.
[333:37.62]It's just...
[333:46.85]That's not what I want.
[333:49.37]Okay, well that's okay, we can salvage it.
[333:50.89]We're making one of those straws.
[334:00.46]We used to drink when we were 10 years old, like the silly milk straws.
[334:05.83]How's that?
[334:11.31]It's part of the design.
[334:14.20]It's part of my Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 rollercoaster design.
[334:17.32]I have saved mine, but I don't think it is openable anymore.
[334:24.70]Like, I get a preview of it, but then I can't edit anything.
[334:27.82]It's just, like, stuck.
[334:30.43]I don't want to fucking tire on it.
[334:31.81]That's okay.
[334:32.87]I'll do the drama and remake the whole thing.
[334:38.13]That's too long.
[334:42.31]God damn it.
[334:45.01]Here we go.
[334:45.45]He went on a three-week video game bender that cost him his health, job, and wife.
[334:54.98]Okay, speedrun.
[334:55.78]Thanks.
[334:56.36]Thanks.
[334:56.82]Coming to the sky.
[334:58.18]Thanks.
[334:58.78]Speedrun.
[334:59.94]He would rather play the video games than be with me sexually.
[335:10.48]I'm ready.
[335:11.50]Let's go.
[335:12.12]I just need a little bit more weight on the front.
[335:19.85]Oh, this is gonna be great.
[335:20.99]I'm gonna have like two more of these.
[335:22.41]Wait, what the hell?
[335:28.89]Get like a weight here, and a weight right here, balance it out.
[335:32.83]No, I'm never gonna get mine back!
[335:37.43]This isn't- this is no replacement for what we had.
[335:43.03]Hold on a second.
[335:49.97]The back wheel.
[335:51.05]I know, I'll fix it, I'll fix it.
[335:52.57]We still have to make, like, our fucking weird, slurpy straw ride.
[336:01.45]No, not mechanics.
[336:04.95]Mounts.
[336:05.29]Damn it.
[336:06.63]And there he is.
[336:08.68]Now I need another fucking, yeah, motor.
[336:18.84]bounce extenders I'm so confused what I'm even doing what guys I need help
[336:49.78]He's gonna be so confused.
[336:57.12]That's not... One more little connector right here.
[337:02.69]Right there.
[337:03.45]Bang.
[337:04.61]No, no, no.
[337:05.31]That was 80 to 60.
[337:19.49]I'm just making Dr. Octopus.
[337:22.08]I don't know what that is.
[337:22.98]Is this gonna drive?
[337:26.20]I don't think it's gonna be able to... Oh, no, it's stuck on the wheel.
[337:28.28]Hold on.
[337:28.58]I haven't... Pull it up a little if I can.
[337:34.53]These won't rotate.
[337:44.09]Just start... Yeah, I know.
[337:44.85]That's what I'm saying.
[337:45.88]Like, my whole thing got broken...
[337:50.28]Well, don't worry.
[337:53.75]Not like it's going to be that big of a deal once you get to see my fucking, my design.
[338:15.58]I'll get the- I'll get the wheel on there.
[338:17.08]I need to make w- No, that's alright.
[338:19.02]I'm done.
[338:19.34]I'm- Let's go.
[338:19.92]Let's just fucking go.
[338:20.94]This is stupid.
[338:22.64]Let's go.
[338:23.06]Let's go.
[338:24.34]Let me just make sure it fucking drives.
[338:27.06]I'm not even checking.
[338:30.08]Okay.
[338:31.38]You ready?
[338:33.04]Yeah.
[338:34.00]So... We're going- We're going- I saved it.
[338:36.74]I'm gonna exit.
[338:39.48]Send me an invite.
[338:40.71]Here we go.
[338:43.97]Online...
[338:51.05]I invite my friend, Darren.
[338:55.28]I mean, Radical or whatever his name was.
[338:57.76]Test bot 2!
[339:01.32]I'm gonna try and use the old one, but my game might just crash.
[339:04.57]Well, we'll find out.
[339:05.43]Here we go.
[339:11.79]Are you ready to get fucking destroyed?
[339:13.85]Oh wait, no.
[339:17.33]What are you doing?
[339:19.01]Why?
[339:19.55]I made the weight class light.
[339:22.73]Oh.
[339:22.97]Yeah, this thing's probably pretty heavy.
[339:25.67]Just realized that too.
[339:26.47]This thing's probably fucking extremely heavy.
[339:30.54]You invite me again?
[339:35.22]Yeah.
[339:35.38]You get the music cranked up a little bit, you know what I mean?
[339:47.45]I'm joining.
[339:50.58]Joining lobby.
[339:51.20]It says please wait.
[339:53.82]Select bot?
[339:55.06]Hmm.
[339:55.70]Yeah.
[339:57.84]Fucking go.
[339:58.28]I'm ready.
[339:59.48]Alright, let's go.
[340:00.32]Hopefully our game doesn't crash.
[340:01.84]Let's kick his ass.
[340:07.77]Yep, that's about what we expected here on the Ster stream.
[340:18.46]Would you like to come and defeat my robot now?
[340:20.81]I'm coming!
[340:24.43]Alright, let's get him!
[340:30.79]Plus 25 points.
[340:33.08]Doing it.
[340:33.72]I can't move my camera.
[340:37.68]I'm getting points right now.
[340:41.16]Oh, warning, warning, I'm about to win.
[340:46.37]Yeah, fuck you.
[340:47.21]Kick his ass.
[340:53.44]I don't even know what you're doing.
[340:54.64]I'm fucking winning.
[340:58.46]I'm winning.
[341:04.58]You're smoking right now.
[341:05.83]Does that mean I'm doing good?
[341:06.85]You're doing great, Jeremu.
[341:20.33]Why are we still doing this?
[341:22.98]Why is this still happening?
[341:25.46]Shouldn't I have killed you, like, five times?
[341:29.64]Do you see the little, like, the lump of turds in the very center of the field?
[341:34.60]I'm gonna go... Yeah, that's, like, your brain.
[341:36.29]That's what it locked my point of view on, and I can't move it, because it's in the ground, and it's not really connected.
[341:43.03]I think you have to destroy that.
[341:46.37]What, like, your fucking brain?
[341:47.56]You have, like, the bat signal?
[341:51.73]Come on.
[341:52.75]Right there.
[341:53.67]That's his core.
[341:55.43]That's his core.
[341:58.37]Can you destroy me?
[341:59.25]You have another 30 seconds to beat me.
[342:03.93]Are you trying to tell me that I can't win?
[342:06.13]I can't beat you in your involvement?
[342:07.45]You're probably going to win by, like, you know, like boxing.
[342:10.79]Like, you're not getting a knockout.
[342:12.59]No one can knock out my bot.
[342:13.71]Where the fuck is your, like, brain?
[342:15.75]I don't understand.
[342:16.55]I don't know.
[342:18.61]Like, over here?
[342:19.21]Hold on.
[342:19.63]Wait a minute.
[342:19.95]Wait a minute.
[342:21.34]The pieces of my robot are scattered everywhere.
[342:26.44]I went... Yeah, you got 4,000 points on me.
[342:31.45]Okay.
[342:31.69]Do you want to rematch?
[342:32.57]You just fucking exploded.
[342:35.21]Rematch.
[342:35.65]Alright, rematch.
[342:40.27]That was so funny.
[342:41.33]Wait, did I never save the 2.0 version?
[342:43.81]You just fucking blew up.
[342:51.00]Okay, rematch.
[342:51.78]I still had to fight him.
[342:56.55]Alright, what?
[342:59.79]Why are you still here?
[343:01.25]I don't know.
[343:02.81]Why is your other corpse here?
[343:04.49]And what is this?
[343:06.31]Yeah, why is my destroyed bot still here?
[343:18.54]Alright, start.
[343:20.16]Can it start?
[343:21.04]Let's go.
[343:21.56]Can you defeat the fucking silly straw?
[343:25.58]This is giving me a headache.
[343:26.60]Did you start it?
[343:27.36]I don't- I hit start.
[343:29.14]I hit start?
[343:30.60]I hit start.
[343:33.08]I think it's having to- What's going on?
[343:35.44]What's that noise?
[343:36.08]What is that noise?
[343:37.32]What is happening?
[343:39.58]Why are we like picking up coins?
[343:43.77]Who's picking up like fucking Mario coins?
[343:52.03]I guess we're restarting our games.
[343:53.67]What?
[343:53.87]Who's getting hit?
[343:55.52]I think we're playing right now.
[343:57.00]No way.
[343:59.02]This is giving me a headache.
[344:00.00]I'm deleting my game.
[344:02.68]Restart your game.
[344:04.22]I have a headache.
[344:04.92]Somebody's getting hit.
[344:06.94]Somebody's getting fucking hit.
[344:14.35]Oh, I've come out.
[344:16.23]My character came out of, like, spawn.
[344:21.08]Are you ready to be invited again?
[344:22.44]I don't know what you're doing, but I left.
[344:24.76]I closed my game.
[344:27.14]He just said 3, 2, 1, start up at the main menu.
[344:32.28]3, 2, 1, start.
[344:35.36]Ugh, my fucking head.

[346:11.34]Getting dildosed.
[346:18.87]Oh, you had handicap parking?
[346:29.59]Who's winning?
[346:31.18]Did I lose?
[346:34.00]I think you lost.
[346:36.78]I win.
[346:38.54]Now someone's knocking on my door.
[346:39.98]A lot.
[346:40.98]A lot of knocking on my door right now.
[346:43.95]Oh my god, shut it up.
[346:48.71]Okay, ready for round two?
[346:50.67]Round two.
[346:54.03]Oh, that was fucking hilarious.
[346:58.34]I gotta make another bot.
[346:59.34]I'm ready.
[346:59.78]This bot sucked.
[347:00.40]I'm ready.
[347:01.84]Start.
[347:03.44]Okay, that's your original design.
[347:08.91]This is your original design.
[347:12.84]Okay, that design does not seem to be really that functional.
[347:17.84]What the fuck?
[347:19.06]What?
[347:20.52]What?
[347:22.96]What am I?
[347:23.90]Just rack up the points.
[347:27.32]Get him with the double blades.
[347:30.14]We're not doing anything.
[347:30.78]There goes a blade.
[347:31.64]There goes one of... I don't know.
[347:33.05]You just... I can't even hurt you.
[347:34.65]You took off both my... They're still spinning and hitting me.
[347:37.41]Oh, fuck.
[347:37.99]I got a back in there.
[347:38.63]My whole body is a weapon.
[347:39.99]Hold on.
[347:41.01]I got one tiny little piss shit blade on the back.
[347:43.57]I'll get you.
[347:47.38]Yeah, grind him up.
[347:48.92]Oh, shit.
[347:49.48]I have nothing left.
[347:50.04]I... I don't understand this robot.
[347:56.14]I ran out of things to hurt you with.
[347:57.64]I'm stuck on your saw.
[347:58.59]I can't drive.
[348:00.65]Okay, guys, we're going for the ram strategy.
[348:06.49]Motherfucker!
[348:08.03]I'm getting the robot view.
[348:12.77]Whoa!
[348:13.33]It's in the blocks.
[348:15.31]He's getting caught up in my fucking tubes.
[348:18.11]There was like an- What the fuck?
[348:22.71]No!
[348:25.73]This is so loud.
[348:27.41]I looked away for a second.
[348:28.71]Where are you?
[348:30.39]Turn around.
[348:33.17]Turn around.
[348:35.34]Can you turn around?
[348:36.82]No, I can't even like see you.
[348:42.27]I can't see your character.
[348:44.21]You're just gone.
[348:45.47]I just hear you hurting yourself.
[348:48.35]You fucking... Where are you?
[348:51.49]I went in the... I exploded from the sewer explosion.
[348:55.42]14,000 points I win.
[348:56.78]Alright, I'm going back to the drawing board.
[348:59.88]What?
[349:00.68]I'm going back to the drawing board.
[349:01.68]I want to make new.
[349:02.38]I want to make new.
[349:04.22]This time I'm going to make something that is just undeniable.
[349:07.96]Un-fucking-deniable.
[349:09.72]Undeniable.
[349:12.99]Just do what I did and cheat and get some shit from the workshop.
[349:17.03]that what you did I mean you're the first one I made hold on a minute you tell me you went to like the workshop you honestly think that I made the thing that you just fought workshop but real dick okay I don't think I made the dildo sir that thing looked like symmetrical and intelligent
[349:48.08]Oh.
[349:48.70]Oh, yes.
[349:49.00]I'm going with a more sleek design, guys.
[349:53.84]I already have high hopes for... Let me... Go back and... Let's just start fresh.
[350:12.58]He's not going to be able to fuck with this one.
[350:14.60]I guarantee it.
[350:20.43]Get this thing going.
[350:29.88]I'm making the thing that won the tournament in BattleBots like 10 years ago.
[350:40.94]If I could fucking do anything right.
[350:42.80]Okay, there we go.
[350:44.94]I'm making, um, I'm making... This is not, this is not working out the way I wanted.
[350:47.96]There we go.
[350:48.44]Okay.
[350:49.41]Making something.
[350:53.36]I gotta actually add wheels to this one.
[350:57.58]That.
[350:59.88]Okay.
[351:02.08]Gotta get some good wheels on it.
[351:05.18]Which connector do you use for the wheels?
[351:08.56]Um... What do you mean?
[351:11.18]You have to put a mount... Power steering.
[351:15.20]Power steering.
[351:17.42]What?
[351:18.86]Power steering.
[351:19.86]Under components, mechanics, power steering.
[351:32.06]Power steering.
[351:33.82]I hear you, I just... Components, mechanics, power steering.
[351:37.71]Okay.
[351:41.17]God.
[351:42.43]Jeez.
[351:44.27]Hold on, this is not the right way.
[351:45.41]I want it to be like that.
[351:49.15]I want this to be the front.
[351:50.05]I'm going to spin it.
[351:53.23]Hold on, that is the front, so...
[352:00.51]Can I just spin the whole damn thing?
[352:01.69]Okay, I'm getting somewhere.
[352:04.86]Getting somewhere with this one.
[352:05.84]Oh, shit.
[352:06.64]Fuck you.
[352:07.06]I didn't want to do that.
[352:08.52]Oh, game sucks.
[352:11.76]Well, no, actually, that's okay, because I can redo this thing the way that I wanted.
[352:18.30]Wait, how do you connect those things to, like, a motor?
[352:20.46]You know what?
[352:23.62]You need a battery.
[352:26.30]What's a battery?
[352:27.60]Battery powers the car.
[352:28.70]God, come on, man.
[352:29.68]Get with the program.
[352:30.72]How do you connect the battery to anything?
[352:33.60]The battery just powers the power steering.
[352:36.24]But how do you connect the battery to the powered steering?
[352:39.03]You don't have to.
[352:39.43]You just need to... Are you asking how to, like, drive it after it's connected?
[352:43.27]You have to click on it and do, um... Like... Controls?
[352:48.47]Yes.
[352:49.09]And then you do forward, back, left, right, whatever you want to do.
[352:54.09]Okay.
[352:57.69]This is the front, so I want to spin this.
[353:04.85]Why is my camera... I'm learning.
[353:15.28]You are.
[353:15.70]Good.
[353:15.86]Good.
[353:16.28]I'm learning.
[353:19.42]I'm learning.
[353:31.11]Okay.
[353:31.69]This thing is gonna destroy you now that I know how to actually do something.
[353:34.75]I wish I could, like, tell what the fuck, which one I'm grabbing here.
[353:39.59]I feel like these aren't gonna work.
[353:55.10]Why is that spinning back?
[353:58.63]Oh, didn't want to do that.
[353:59.59]Didn't want to do that.
[354:00.55]Pull it back.
[354:01.38]Pull it back.
[354:02.28]What the fuck am I making?
[354:04.70]Ah, now we're getting somewhere.
[354:10.10]Now we're getting somewhere.
[354:11.64]Oh, they decided to play scrap mechanic again?
[354:16.48]No, Etalyx.
[354:17.15]This is way better than scrap mechanic.
[354:19.31]Scrap mechanic has nothing on this.
[354:25.41]Build...
[354:27.00]Did you figure out how to do, like, armor?
[354:28.42]The armor just changes what your chassis... I don't know if it's just a white plastic piece of shit.
[354:33.10]Your armor just changes the chassis, what it's built out of.
[354:36.17]You can see the match change at the top.
[354:37.59]Oh, okay.
[354:37.89]I see.
[354:38.61]There's a color something somewhere.
[354:39.69]There's, like, actually killing me.
[354:41.11]Yeah.
[354:41.23]This is fucking steel.
[354:54.93]It's actually, this, this might work.
[354:56.29]This might work very well.
[355:00.00]I'm finally, I'm finally seeing like my, my design come to fruition.
[355:06.64]This is what I wanted the first time.
[355:08.00]That was foolish.
[355:17.21]Need like fast, like street tires.
[355:26.22]Might be an issue, but whatever.
[355:29.76]This is definitely an issue.
[355:33.57]Why would I want a short chainsaw?
[355:43.15]I'm going to mute just so I can tell you my strategy here.
[355:50.31]I just... I just don't understand...
[355:54.77]Is there a copy button?
[355:55.89]Like, I can control C, like, control V shit would be so nice.
[355:59.21]I have no idea if there's anything like that.
[356:04.82]I wish there was.
[356:10.88]Work.
[356:12.10]I need, like, extenders.
[356:13.08]I don't know how I can do this.
[356:26.50]That's still connected.
[356:27.66]It should work.
[356:30.91]I hope so.
[356:37.43]Oh, there we go.
[356:45.29]Oh, here we go.
[356:46.31]Dude, this is it.
[356:47.75]This is it.
[356:49.99]Can I not bring it all the way down?
[356:53.33]Yes, I can.
[356:57.46]I'm just like a giant snow shovel.
[357:02.13]That's going to be too awkward.
[357:03.77]Like that.
[357:04.45]I'm going to put some weights on it too.
[357:12.25]Wait, can I?
[357:15.84]I'm just not going to know what's coming.
[357:20.70]That's not low enough.
[357:22.92]I might just scrape off the ground though.
[357:24.54]That's a good thing.
[357:27.74]Get some fucking power on this thing.
[357:37.72]Power this thing the fuck up.
[357:39.27]Okay.
[357:44.99]Okay.
[357:46.99]I don't know if this is connected.
[357:48.37]I hope it is.
[357:48.89]I'm gonna do this.
[357:56.84]Can I stick these wheels out?
[358:00.18]Yes, I can.
[358:02.58]Perfect.
[358:03.70]Perfect.
[358:04.43]This is going to be perfect.
[358:16.51]I'm easily going to win.
[358:18.07]Easily.
[358:18.81]Got a couple of wheels on there.
[358:32.07]that up there.
[358:34.95]Different layers of horns.
[358:36.31]Theoretically.
[358:36.91]Could be able just to extend them, right?
[358:46.29]Another one.
[358:49.53]Another one.
[358:51.04]And another one.
[358:51.80]Okay.
[358:55.54]See if that works.
[359:06.00]Just need to see if this thing stands.
[359:08.82]That's all I care about at the moment.
[359:10.25]I think I'm ready.
[359:10.91]I don't even want to test it.
[359:12.81]You guys don't get to see the test.
[359:14.03]It does.
[359:18.05]Now, I'm going to put, like, a weight?
[359:20.15]A couple weights here?
[359:21.03]No!
[359:21.37]It's broken again!
[359:22.37]They're not actually... Oh, baby!
[359:26.93]It crashed my game.
[359:27.75]I'm going to be in the money scene.
[359:32.29]Needs more snow shovel.
[359:42.38]I'm ready.
[359:42.86]Let's go.
[359:45.15]I worked so hard on mine and it broke.
[359:49.71]Hold on now.
[359:51.47]You're so hasty.
[359:58.10]If we have time to create a bot, we're going with a really simple design.
[360:02.12]We're just going to have a nice cube.
[360:03.44]We're going to build...
[360:11.47]We're gonna... Oh, a couple more.
[360:12.85]A couple more and we'll be ready.
[360:20.00]And I'm gonna cover it.
[360:21.72]Oh, it's gonna be great.
[360:33.22]in real life has low self-esteem, socially very awkward, but yet in the game, they become a great warrior.
[360:38.71]The most important thing, guys.
[360:40.21]Let's get some components.
[360:44.65]Let's get some mounts.
[360:45.99]I'm trying to do this as fast as I can.
[360:59.22]We're just going to add a bunch to the top.
[361:01.44]Get a couple of these.
[361:15.67]No, that's too steep.
[361:23.42]I'm just gonna put a whole bunch of horns on this.
[361:25.02]I don't know how to activate it, but I'll try.
[361:26.94]I'm gonna just put horns all over it.
[361:30.66]No!
[361:32.06]What?
[361:34.32]Did you break it again?
[361:35.25]You're stealing my idea.
[361:37.75]What are you talking about stealing your idea?
[361:41.82]Are we both adding horns to our... This is going to be the most obnoxious fight ever.
[361:49.55]God damn it.
[361:57.72]Just click the snap button, please.
[361:59.44]I was going to say there has to be something like that.
[362:01.86]Snap just moves it up in increments.
[362:14.23]This is so dumb.
[362:15.81]I don't know how to even activate this.
[362:16.95]It's not actually snapping to anything.
[362:29.14]Hey, I want you to know it's, you know, like... These just look like lamps.
[362:39.95]Alright.
[362:41.21]Let's make sure I can drive.
[362:47.83]Don't do that save it tests just three One of these gumdrops do I want oh Yeah, hold on not done not done.
[363:14.71]Oh
[363:21.89]This is fun.
[363:22.57]This is gonna be fun.
[363:23.99]Can we just start soon?
[363:25.79]No.
[363:26.27]No, we can't.
[363:27.19]This is important.
[363:28.19]My guy has to have a face.
[363:30.65]Well, I guess I have time to add... You have time.
[363:35.16]...things.
[363:36.08]I don't know.
[363:39.90]He's getting... That's absolutely what he's getting.
[363:42.10]Eager oatmeal. ...
[363:53.93]Battery low, morale low.
[363:56.13]Don't worry, there's gonna be like four batteries on this fucking thing.
[364:00.31]It's not working.
[364:09.72]How's it not working?
[364:13.08]What's not working?
[364:14.30]Anything.
[364:16.18]Like, nothing.
[364:17.84]Anything.
[364:25.47]I have power.
[364:30.63]You probably need air.
[364:31.83]Oh, uh, I probably do.
[364:46.91]Oh no, wait, that's the wrong side.
[364:48.61]How do I rotate this, like, up?
[364:51.17]You could totally do that.
[365:01.86]Wait, did I have that?
[365:02.90]No, what?
[365:08.37]Oh, this is great.
[365:19.34]Well, I'm just going to make it controls.
[365:25.24]No, looks a little...
[365:32.37]Okay, glad that's settled.
[365:35.73]Let's test it.
[365:41.21]Fuck.
[365:41.45]It's not heavy enough.
[365:50.49]What's the issue here?
[365:53.11]Oh, hold on.
[365:55.05]It's taking so much of my brain power.
[365:58.86]Where was the power steering?
[366:01.26]Components.
[366:03.21]Components.
[366:30.85]Get in the ass.
[366:36.39]Bigger wheels.
[366:39.29]I'm gonna make the big wheels in the back, little wheels in the front.
[366:44.51]That makes sense, right?
[366:49.21]Why do you have to make the horns?
[366:54.04]Sharma, we just need to go.
[366:58.50]We've been doing this for like an hour.
[367:00.74]I'm like enjoying this right now.
[367:06.81]I don't know that anyone watching my stream is though.
[367:10.41]I guess so, they're still here.
[367:11.95]I'm surprised.
[367:13.99]I am truly astonished how many people have stayed here for this.
[367:18.49]We will wait.
[367:34.69]How do you do paint?
[367:35.34]Where's paint again?
[367:39.94]I don't remember.
[367:40.92]I have no idea.
[367:42.62]It's just on the main.
[367:51.04]real life has low self-esteem you know socially very awkward but yet in the game they become a great warrior so thanks happy fans what the fuck what do I do what's going on what I do wrong the fact are these just not touching yeah they're not touching okay when I get I we're gonna do back we're gonna do rear wheel rear wheel drive
[368:27.43]If these aren't... I can't, like, turn these sideways to put on the side.
[368:36.56]Normally, before, I could.
[368:42.66]Batteries.
[368:43.12]I need more fuckin' batteries?
[368:44.52]Dammit.
[368:48.20]4K!
[368:50.34]This battery right here?
[369:12.90]Need more batteries?
[369:14.12]What did I do wrong?
[369:19.21]I don't know, I... I thought I was.
[369:22.99]Power at 2400 volts, dude.
[369:27.88]That's a lot of volts.
[369:29.44]I'm like done with this.
[369:30.56]This is all I wanted.
[369:31.80]This is what the joke was when I made it.
[369:40.25]What, are they not connected?
[369:41.45]Before, just using the mouse would rotate things.
[369:44.81]Control does nothing.
[369:46.33]As much as everyone kept telling me to use control, I have not found a use for it yet.
[369:50.86]I haven't been paying attention to anything it's been saying.
[369:59.80]This is barely turning.
[370:01.42]God damn.
[370:07.13]Karma, come on.
[370:08.83]Come on.
[370:11.36]There was a build time limit that we specified.
[370:16.85]Jeremiah, there's a build time spec... We specified a build time.
[370:21.37]You've exceeded the limit.
[370:23.49]Hold on, there we go.
[370:34.12]I got a fucking shitload of motors now.
[370:38.28]Delete the second battery?
[370:39.34]I don't know.
[370:39.70]Payment for services rendered.
[370:40.78]Pleasure doing business.
[370:42.64]Nah, I can't.
[370:43.04]Nothing's even touching.
[370:43.74]Also, please tell Jerma that the battery is touching the goddamn floor.
[370:47.37]Jerma, the battery is touching the goddamn floor.
[370:49.77]The battery, the battery, the battery, the battery.
[370:54.97]Get a bunch of fucking little batteries, then.
[371:00.65]Actually, they're not touching the floor.
[371:02.83]These ones aren't touching the floor.
[371:13.82]Battery low.
[371:14.68]Pull up battery.
[371:15.84]I don't understand.
[371:22.30]I can't.
[371:22.90]Supercharge!
[371:23.90]Jerma.
[371:24.34]Jerma.
[371:24.84]Jerma.
[371:26.76]How do you rotate something to the side and put it on the side of your robot?
[371:31.58]Because it's not.
[371:33.08]Before I could.
[371:36.26]I'm like missing something though.
[371:38.15]I figured it out.
[371:39.47]I'm a genius.
[371:43.16]There's one, like, key component that I'm, like, forgetting to do.
[371:45.68]He went on a three-week video game bender that cost him his health, job, and wife.
[371:51.43]Thanks to server mainstream.
[371:57.09]I swear before, I could just rotate him with the mouse.
[372:00.69]The one's gonna believe me.
[372:02.15]Streamer's dumb.
[372:02.85]Streamer's dumb.
[372:08.29]It's too heavy.
[372:09.33]No, it can't be too heavy.
[372:14.71]I'm gonna take off some of these then.
[372:17.57]Just curious.
[372:19.03]If I can get it to touch the ground, it would be perfect.
[372:22.57]Have you seen how dumb this streamer is?
[372:25.62]Which one?
[372:25.96]Me, you, or both of us?
[372:28.02]Both of us.
[372:29.26]Oh, yeah.
[372:30.26]That would have been done with my robot already, but streamer's dumb.
[372:37.14]If I can just get this to touch the damn ground.
[372:41.83]Can I lower this?
[372:42.63]Will it actually help me here?
[372:45.68]I wonder if I can just, like, dig it down here like that.
[372:49.64]I mean, I'm just... Let's see what that does.
[372:51.71]I'm just putting more horns on these, aren't I?
[372:55.87]Oh, progress.
[372:59.35]We're getting progress.
[373:07.74]God damn it, these are the most intuitive controls.
[373:20.58]It goes in a circle.
[373:22.84]It lives.
[373:25.20]Two tons.
[373:28.80]Well, what am I supposed to do?
[373:31.26]I need it to be this big.
[373:32.42]It has to be this big and, like, annoying.
[373:34.18]Alright, we're doing fucking... I don't even give a fuck anymore.
[373:42.38]He went on a three-week video game bender that cost him his health, job, and wife.
[373:49.23]Why are people subbing to me while I'm doing this?
[373:58.27]The eyes are touching the ground.
[374:07.90]Okay.
[374:08.86]Test it.
[374:09.68]Components.
[374:11.80]So much power.
[374:17.57]Get rid of the needless.
[374:18.57]Did you just say the needless horns?
[374:20.21]I want to make sure you understand what you just said there.
[374:26.26]I... Moments ago, my robot worked.
[374:30.54]I clicked test and everything flew off of it.
[374:37.37]Large CO2 tank.
[374:38.97]We're just gonna have to go with fucking straight up CO2.
[374:47.94]We just need pure noxious gas to be able to move this thing.
[375:05.55]Okay.
[375:07.89]It's completely broken.
[375:08.95]I can't do anything again.
[375:11.83]You fucked it up?
[375:13.27]Yeah.
[375:14.71]I tested it.
[375:15.61]It worked.
[375:16.25]I added a couple of things.
[375:18.91]I tested it, and it all exploded.
[375:21.91]I think my thing just weighs too much.
[375:24.15]I have no idea.
[375:24.79]Can we just please, please, for the love of God, like, go?
[375:28.12]You've been doing this for too long.
[375:30.62]Well, yours doesn't work either, so mine doesn't work either.
[375:32.96]Let's go!
[375:34.24]It's not gonna work!
[375:35.10]It's gonna work, we just go!
[375:36.36]Hold on, I need to make, hold on a second.
[375:39.02]One more second.
[375:41.95]How do I make this so I can, like, activate them?
[375:45.05]I can't remove the things I added, because now as soon as I open it and test, it breaks.
[375:54.09]So it's gonna be one of those again, where you just break.
[376:00.39]I don't get it.
[376:01.01]Like, there's nothing to press on this screen.
[376:07.46]It looks like it's together though, I- Please, Jerome.
[376:11.42]Please.
[376:12.72]Alright, let's just go, fine.
[376:17.65]How Jerma his batteries are dragging on the ground.
[376:19.93]Everyone, people have given me money to tell you this.
[376:22.79]Dude, it doesn't matter.
[376:24.49]I've raised them.
[376:27.07]I've raised them like they were my own.
[376:28.63]Okay, I'll do it.
[376:29.51]Patty, you're... They're not touching the ground.
[376:33.55]Look, they're stuffed in here.
[376:37.44]Patty, Connie, you're nuts.
[376:38.26]I'm gonna go all the way up with them.
[376:40.60]And my noxious gasp.
[376:43.78]This battle's for you.
[376:44.84]These things are useless.
[376:53.99]Jerma, I'm waiting for you.
[376:56.51]He's got like all these batteries in his face.
[376:59.17]Alright, I'm just gonna say whatever happens.
[377:00.79]I want a hundred bucks.
[377:01.73]Let's go.
[377:04.21]I think someone just bet on me.
[377:07.19]Alright, add me.
[377:09.93]If only Jerma took the tips that someone could have told him the batteries were low.
[377:15.73]No, it's definitely the chassis material.
[377:17.93]I'm just gonna make it plastic.
[377:19.01]I don't even have it.
[377:21.63]I can do that real quick.
[377:22.67]Hold on.
[377:23.76]I don't even know how to say the thank yous.
[377:25.60]I don't have energy for this shit.
[377:29.38]Alright, it's made out of fucking cardboard.
[377:45.77]Alright, I'm ready.
[377:48.43]I'm coming in.
[377:56.22]You ready?
[377:58.24]Let's do it.
[377:59.55]Robot arena.
[378:00.55]Robot arena.
[378:02.51]Mm-hmm.
[378:05.57]I hope mine works.
[378:07.27]I hope it doesn't explode.
[378:13.53]Shit about me.
[378:14.96]You haven't made a working fucking robot this whole time.
[378:18.64]Why?
[378:19.02]And you broke everything.
[378:22.08]Everyone yells at me, but at least I have a fucking functioning robot that doesn't explode.
[378:27.24]No!
[378:29.09]Come on.
[378:29.91]I think I lowered my tires too much.
[378:32.29]They're in the ground.
[378:33.67]But I can't edit my robot anymore.
[378:35.65]What?
[378:39.40]Like, seriously.
[378:41.00]Does my robot have googly eyes?
[378:44.26]Yeah, see?
[378:44.90]I can...
[378:46.49]The game's crashing.
[378:47.92]I can't even see you driving, so it must have... No, I can't even... the game... you have locked up this whole game.
[378:57.52]I'm gone!
[378:58.24]My car, I'm gone.
[378:59.04]Yeah, I exit.
[379:00.00]Yeah, yeah.
[379:02.44]Alright, let's try again.
[379:03.62]Oh my god, dude, what the fuck?
[379:06.40]I've spent so much time on that for me to... I can't even edit it anymore.
[379:13.55]I know what's wrong and I can't go in and fix it.
[379:23.18]Oh, God.
[379:24.00]That's why I was saying, please, let's go.
[379:30.10]I knew that was happening.
[379:32.88]Every time.
[379:33.52]Come here.
[379:36.46]I'm ready.
[379:36.76]It just fucking explodes.
[379:42.45]Hold on.
[379:42.73]I'm joining.
[379:45.51]I'm ready.
[379:45.89]Have you figured out how to work the horns?
[379:50.79]Yeah, here's my fucking truck.
[379:53.83]You didn't make that.
[379:54.69]I didn't make it.
[379:56.02]You didn't make this.
[379:56.72]It didn't instantly explode, so I must not have made this.
[379:59.32]Not fucking fair.
[379:59.74]You didn't make it.
[380:01.62]I don't know the buttons to drive.
[380:02.94]Is this... Wait, what?
[380:07.30]I can't... Oh.
[380:08.46]Oh!
[380:09.02]Whoa!
[380:10.36]I didn't put... Okay, I know what I did wrong.
[380:14.76]Do something, move me, move me, move me, move me, quick!
[380:17.55]Move me, move me!
[380:18.77]I'm getting a warning.
[380:21.53]I win.
[380:26.63]You didn't even make that one, not fair.
[380:28.72]Dude, if I used one that I made... Okay, you wanna... Alright, I'm going to the Steam Workshop.
[380:37.40]How do you, where'd you get it?
[380:39.74]No, no, no.
[380:40.80]Just click Workshop on the main menu.
[380:42.43]I'm getting this to fucking work.
[380:48.64]Okay, what was this one?
[380:54.94]Okay, no, this is another one that's broken.
[380:59.91]Holy shit, wait, I can actually edit this one.
[381:02.67]No, fix it!
[381:03.43]Wait, no.
[381:05.07]That one is unredeemable.
[381:06.19]Fucking dumb horn.
[381:07.01]Get these stupid fucking horns off.
[381:08.69]What the fuck?!
[381:10.39]The horns were the fucking variable here.
[381:15.04]Horns were the variable.
[381:17.50]They're gone.
[381:23.32]It's placing all of the objects that have been placed on my robot in the same spot.
[381:30.45]All inside the middle of it.
[381:35.19]Wait, what?
[381:42.50]There's just a whole bunch of random objects in the middle of my robot.
[381:47.60]Hold on a second, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[381:52.02]Like, every single horn is here.
[381:55.32]Or is it?
[381:56.32]I don't know.
[381:56.82]I can't move anything.
[381:59.19]Well, I didn't do this.
[382:01.29]You broke the game.
[382:08.13]I saved it by accident.
[382:12.68]Okay.
[382:13.50]That's cool.
[382:14.96]I spent a lot of time on that.
[382:20.59]Let's go workshop.
[382:24.69]That's too big.
[382:28.99]Just benefit off of other people's creativity.
[382:31.37]No, that's too wide.
[382:32.65]I'm getting the yin-yang.
[382:36.06]I'm getting the... I'm getting like a spider.
[382:45.82]I have so many questions.
[382:48.85]Apparently my test bot is on the workshop.
[382:53.13]Or is that someone else's?
[383:12.97]It would have to be someone else's because there's just a bunch of them.
[383:17.64]Jarmo, Jarmo, Jarmo, I'm not sitting here waiting for you.
[383:22.07]I'm either done or you're ready.
[383:25.37]Alright, okay, let's go.
[383:28.93]You're not having fun building robots?
[383:30.91]Not when they fucking implode after I spend 30 minutes on them.
[383:36.76]Alright, well, invite me.
[383:43.87]See, what we should have done is before streaming, we should have made like three each, but we didn't do that.
[383:49.67]We did not do that.
[383:57.65]Yes, I agree.
[383:58.23]The funniest part of the stream is that there are people watching.
[384:10.16]My stream and your stream combined?
[384:13.26]Yeah.
[384:15.76]This game will never have this many viewers ever again.
[384:21.32]Dude, this is like, fun.
[384:22.54]Oh no, I'm doing the... I'm doing the... Cigarette spaghetti tits.
[384:47.12]Alright, you ready?
[384:48.62]Yeah.
[384:49.62]Alright.
[384:52.06]I thought you were the fucking bench.
[385:00.42]That's no fair.
[385:02.40]That is no fucking fair.
[385:03.78]Why can't we build that shit?
[385:05.92]Come get some.
[385:10.44]Alright, fine, I'll get some.
[385:12.37]Just back him up.
[385:13.43]Just back me into the subway car.
[385:15.95]Am I already dead?
[385:18.60]What the fuck?
[385:20.80]Here comes the train.
[385:27.75]I can't see it.
[385:29.57]I can't... You still won!
[385:32.85]How did you still win?
[385:35.57]No, no, no.
[385:36.07]You win.
[385:37.29]I'm Ying Yang.
[385:38.50]And I'm eliminated.
[385:39.40]You're the winner.
[385:40.22]Because I got hit by a train.
[385:41.46]Alright, let's go.
[385:46.76]Wheels too low.
[385:52.94]We're back on the terrain level?
[385:54.00]Yeah, start.
[385:56.94]Okay, this thing is fucking actually pretty damn cool.
[386:05.49]Well, you have the most boring fucking vehicle I've ever seen.
[386:08.63]You just have a wooden truck.
[386:10.67]The axe on my back keeps like... How am I supposed to lift you?
[386:19.06]Oh, I lose.
[386:20.08]Nope, I win.
[386:22.46]I- I'm just a truck!
[386:25.12]I can't- I can't fucking lift you like this.
[386:31.61]Oh, there goes my arms.
[386:34.13]This is a... shit fight.
[386:37.31]Yeah, this fight sucks.
[386:38.11]We're both shit characters.
[386:40.53]Come fight me down here.
[386:42.73]Come fight me in the fucking train tracks.
[386:44.70]I'm- I'm done for.
[386:48.52]How did- what?
[386:50.68]Hey, I made that wooden truck.
[386:52.14]It's a good truck, but it's not a real death machine.
[386:54.62]We're doing the classic BattleBot, and I'm going with my strongest one.
[386:59.94]I actually am going with my strongest one.
[387:03.01]I'm going to try the HypnoDisc.
[387:06.81]I'm going with my original character.
[387:09.31]This is the real BattleBots arena.
[387:12.13]This really is the BattleBots arena.
[387:13.31]3, 2, 1, start!
[387:22.72]Where are you?
[387:24.92]Oh, you're the pizza cutter.
[387:26.42]I'm so tiny.
[387:34.87]I can't even see you.
[387:47.69]You just got dropped out of the trap door.
[387:52.32]I'm so glad that, like, I'm, like, having a good time.
[387:56.71]You, you, all of your robots have not functioned except the ones that you've pulled off the Steam Workshop.
[388:02.83]Let's go.
[388:03.11]I'm ready.
[388:05.80]You're not having a good time.
[388:07.12]Oh, look at this level.
[388:13.22]I sound like I'm already dead.
[388:15.52]Yeah, you do.
[388:19.65]What is going on?
[388:21.73]What is happening?
[388:25.33]I'm going to come find you.
[388:27.31]I'm just going to go to the trailer.
[388:32.84]What?
[388:33.26]Ow, my stomach.
[388:37.48]I'm driving around.
[388:40.58]Wait, look at the... I can't.
[388:44.64]I'm driving.
[388:45.60]I can't look around.
[388:56.48]You said, wait, what?
[388:59.10]And then they went, wait, what?
[389:01.76]Let's go.
[389:03.90]Let's go.
[389:05.73]Wait, what?
[389:06.63]I want a rematch.
[389:07.47]Wait, what?
[389:10.57]That's what I find the funniest in all things.
[389:13.65]Oh, I won?
[389:15.43]Yes, I fucking fell right through the trap.
[389:18.37]Oh, like before we even started?
[389:21.57]I thought just with my luck that I'd lost.
[389:25.09]No, okay, just don't... Here he comes!
[389:31.15]Here comes the truck!
[389:37.35]That one looks like a good fucking car.
[389:40.58]This thing is too fast.
[389:42.52]Come get me.
[389:44.18]Come attack me.
[389:45.90]Come get me!
[389:54.25]Seriously, I'm just a mouse.
[389:55.41]You're just a... This is by far the best thing, by the way.
[390:02.56]What a fucking cartoon we're both doing right now.
[390:05.98]You're back here.
[390:08.06]Oh, he got me.
[390:10.38]This sucks.
[390:11.14]What's the purpose of this thing?
[390:13.02]It doesn't do anything.
[390:19.36]Great, I'm on my back.
[390:20.63]Now you can just hit me right in the nuts with a hammer.
[390:25.71]Nothing is happening.
[390:26.95]I love this cartoon.
[390:42.58]The sledgehammer Jeep versus the Roomba.
[390:49.77]I think there's only one more I haven't tried that I got.
[390:51.99]This is fucking amazing.
[390:55.67]The disco floor.
[391:01.96]Hold on.
[391:02.74]Aren't the only other words of dialog this guy's had?
[391:09.50]Ooh.
[391:09.76]Yeah, I'm quick.
[391:13.54]You and your fucking ship steering wheel.
[391:16.26]This thing is so fast.
[391:21.81]I like these other views, they're so much better.
[391:23.71]Alright, what happens when Blade goes against Blade, what do you think?
[391:27.85]I don't know.
[391:31.31]No, apparently your Blade's a little low and mine's a little too high, so you're gonna win.
[391:43.75]No!
[391:45.79]You're just dead, just give up.
[391:47.01]I can't even fucking hit you!
[391:48.23]Just give it up.
[391:48.63]I can't hit you, you're too low!
[391:51.85]Wait a minute, now it's low.
[391:54.70]I win.
[391:56.58]Was that satisfactory?
[391:57.74]Let's do one more.
[392:06.92]I'm going with my strongest and I'm going on the best map.
[392:18.79]It's overextending.
[392:22.76]Welcome.
[392:26.32]What?
[392:27.52]I'm laughing at your crane arm.
[392:29.56]That's when I was going with my best and you went with like the sprinkler.
[392:34.70]Dude, just wait till this thing whips around and fucking smashes.
[392:40.53]I lose.
[392:44.01]Nope.
[392:44.79]I'm good.
[392:48.97]I gotta get like some centrifugal force here.
[392:52.51]We're going for a fucking clothesline.
[392:58.95]How is anyone ever supposed to fight this?
[393:00.73]Kind of the perfect spot.
[393:03.21]There's no way.
[393:04.55]It's perfect.
[393:05.15]It is the perfect battle bot.
[393:07.59]It just has bear claws that spin at 100 miles per hour.
[393:10.52]The only problem is that it can't actually drive in a straight line.
[393:16.46]I can't even fucking hit you.
[393:17.48]I lose.
[393:18.20]Yeah.
[393:19.77]I can't imagine you getting anything that can beat this.
[393:23.06]Hold on.
[393:25.58]I cannot conceive of a bot that will beat it.
[393:30.58]Oh, yeah?
[393:31.66]Yeah.
[393:32.22]Let's go.
[393:36.39]The showerhead robot.
[393:38.97]That's not gonna beat it!
[393:40.77]You don't think that's gonna beat it?
[393:42.43]Okay.
[393:45.11]It's real cute of you to think that.
[393:48.87]Not gonna beat it, huh?
[393:51.89]Ooh, somebody's done what they call fucked up.
[394:02.13]What?
[394:02.56]You won.
[394:03.02]That's not how physics work.
[394:10.60]I did it.
[394:11.02]I was stuck in the wall.
[394:13.82]Oh shit, I'm getting a mobility warning.
[394:16.06]But mine started first.
[394:18.61]You win.
[394:22.49]I won?
[394:23.67]I won a rematch.
[394:25.65]Oh, you won a rematch, huh?
[394:26.43]I won a rematch.
[394:27.75]Well, you got what we call fucking destroyed.
[394:30.51]I can't conceive of a bot that will beat me.
[394:38.00]The perfect bot.
[394:40.26]It's just a mess.
[394:41.72]So you end up hurting yourself.
[394:43.26]I was taking it easy on you in the beginning.
[394:44.86]Oh, go ahead.
[394:45.74]Take it easy on me.
[394:47.30]Why is that happening?
[394:49.38]God, take it easy on me, buddy.
[394:51.41]Hey, what's that?
[394:52.49]Oh, I'm going to take it easy.
[394:53.67]Somebody's immobile right now.
[394:55.06]It's too bad.
[394:56.02]Something happened there.
[394:57.84]I'm not sure what.
[395:00.17]I'm going to circle around and do my victory lap.
[395:01.93]You left again.
[395:02.63]I win.
[395:07.74]Did you just quit the whole game?
