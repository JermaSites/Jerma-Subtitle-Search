[00:03.74]This is TF2.
[00:04.90]Like, I don't understand how, at any given time, 20 or 30 people are on here doing this.
[00:10.13]What the hell?
[00:10.97]There's people riding around us in, like, a roller coaster?
[00:15.79]Yeah.
[00:17.69]Why?
[00:18.69]Why is there people riding in a roller coaster?
[00:21.81]Yeah, fuck this.
[00:22.53]I want to ride the roller coaster.
[00:24.07]Okay, how do we get on this?
[00:25.31]I don't know.
[00:25.87]I'm going to wait for it to come this way, and then we'll jump on it.
[00:29.15]No, I think it stops.
[00:31.11]No, you shut up.
[00:31.89]It's coming this way.
[00:32.67]We're going to get on it.
[00:33.52]I'm telling you, I bet you it stops.
[00:36.58]It doesn't stop.
[00:39.18]You went straight in the air.
[00:40.70]I'm gonna, I'm going to actually wait.
[00:44.42]Damn it, you can't even stand in the track.
[00:46.66]I'll get it.
[00:48.35]I will get it.
[00:52.42]Okay.
[00:52.90]I tried to get in, and it's just teleporting away.
[00:58.20]I'll get it over here.
[00:58.96]I got it.
[00:59.92]I'm going to get it.
[01:00.80]I'm in.
[01:01.46]No.
[01:02.50]That's BS.
[01:03.34]I was in there.
[01:05.08]You can't get on top of it either.
[01:08.01]By the way, I love how the roller coaster is just like a bunch of wood.
[01:12.69]I'm in it, and this is even more painful to be in it than it is to try and get in.
[01:17.07]Damn it.
[01:17.65]Oh, my God.
[01:18.57]Did I get in?
[01:19.95]I'm in.
[01:20.74]Just stand still.
[01:21.52]Just stand still in the back with me.
[01:23.76]Isn't this awful?
[01:24.72]Yeah, this... Yeah, this is horrible.
[01:27.16]We're gonna hit the medic!
[01:28.94]Oh... Do you think it was real?
[01:31.01]I gotta get out of this.
[01:31.89]I can't be in there anymore.
[01:33.17]I can't get out.
[01:34.09]I can't get out either.
[01:36.45]We're stuck.
[01:36.89]We're stuck in here forever.
[01:38.21]You're red.
[01:38.65]So you got on the red side.
[01:40.17]Okay.
[01:43.13]Let's play checkers.
[01:45.06]It's your turn first.
[01:46.28]No.
[01:46.94]Oh, yeah.
[01:47.28]You moved yours.
[01:47.96]Yeah, your turn.
[01:48.82]You moved your, like, pill.
[01:50.87]Yeah, your turn.
[01:54.55]Oh, good job.
[01:55.19]Good.
[01:55.71]Yeah, good game of checkers we just played.
[01:58.11]I win.
[01:58.51]No, he's fun.
[01:59.13]You win.
[01:59.89]Yeah, I won.
[02:02.99]We did it.
[02:03.76]We played checkers together.
[02:05.14]Whoa.
[02:06.10]Hey, you wanna play?
[02:06.94]Hey, come over here.
[02:07.50]You wanna play chess?
[02:08.26]You wanna play this, like, fucking mess of chess?
[02:10.56]Like, how are you ever supposed to put these up?
[02:12.66]How are you supposed to focus and play chess while this song is playing?
[02:18.52]I can't.
[02:18.86]I can't.
[02:19.12]I can't.
[02:20.60]I don't understand this.
[02:24.92]Dude, chess is such a deliberate game.
[02:28.54]Like, how are you supposed to even put these pieces back together?
[02:30.82]Can you reset this shit?
[02:32.62]I don't know.
[02:33.26]I don't think so.
[02:34.04]There's no way.
[02:37.11]Place your bet.
[02:38.31]Place your bet.
[02:39.23]Especially the fact that people can just come over here and just like knock shit around.
[02:42.85]Are we really?
[02:44.15]Ski ball?
[02:44.89]Ski ball?
[02:45.59]We're shooting pills.
[02:46.49]You shoot one pill and I'll shoot one.
[02:48.87]Oh, wow.
[02:50.83]Skee-ball!
[02:52.58]Aw.
[02:54.36]Aw, man.
[02:55.00]Man, this is tough.
[02:57.36]This is tough.
[02:58.96]This guy's standing in my way.
[02:59.76]I can't even see if I made it or not.
[03:00.96]You're using the lock and load.
[03:02.00]It doesn't work.
[03:03.00]Get out of here!
[03:05.00]You're ruining the game!
[03:06.18]I'm playing with my friend!
[03:07.30]Leave!
[03:07.66]Dude, you have to, like, pay for this stuff?
[03:13.51]Step away from the skee-ball.
[03:18.66]You know what, I'm just gonna try to- Can you even get it in?
[03:20.76]I don't think you can even get it in!
[03:22.54]Looks like- Hold on, I'm gonna examine this.
[03:24.92]You got one in?
[03:27.34]Oh yeah, you can get in.
[03:30.19]I'm lagging all over the place and I can't even tell.
[03:33.87]No, it doesn't even go in, it just sits there and then explodes.
[03:36.57]Yeah, it doesn't, like, roll down and give you points, but it can, like, get in.
[03:40.52]We're still here.
[03:41.80]We're still on the server.
[03:43.20]We're still here.
[03:45.85]Alright, we have to ride the Tower of Terror before we go anywhere else.
[03:53.31]Like, I can sticky jump higher than that, but that's like the exciting ride while you come to this server.
[03:58.39]You guys are going up so slow.
[04:00.71]Here we go!
[04:02.43]It's gonna be fun!
[04:06.57]Hey.
[04:08.05]Alright, make sure to hold your breath!
[04:10.46]We're almost at the top!
[04:12.88]This is gonna be awful.
[04:15.02]Yeah, this is gonna be awful.
[04:18.28]I have a feeling it's gonna kill us.
[04:20.56]You think it's gonna kill us?
[04:21.28]I think it is.
[04:22.12]It might.
[04:22.42]I mean, our bodies might, like, gravity up.
[04:24.22]Like, let's jump when it goes down.
[04:25.78]Alright, ready?
[04:26.95]We're gonna be pretty close.
[04:28.85]How close are we?
[04:29.47]I can't even tell how close we are.
[04:30.39]I don't know.
[04:30.81]When it goes down, just jump.
[04:34.98]Oh!
[04:35.20]What was that?
[04:37.97]I want my money back.
[04:39.57]That was awful.
[04:40.79]That was stupid.
[04:41.99]This ride sucks.
[04:43.15]Don't you know, that's how it works.
[04:44.61]When you go to a carnival, you have to ride every ride once, and then you're allowed to go home.
[04:49.84]I want to go home now.
[04:51.02]I feel sick.
[04:54.86]Is this the only thing else that's here?
[04:56.00]I'm getting out.
[04:56.66]No, don't!
[05:00.00]Look at this!
[05:00.42]Look at this monster sentry!
[05:01.84]What is this for?
[05:03.10]Where?
[05:03.58]Go to the entrance.
[05:07.27]Come on.
[05:09.01]Alright, I'm at the- OH MY GOD!
[05:12.29]What is the purpose of this thing?
[05:13.59]And who- what is it?
[05:14.15]Is it shooting at this medic?
[05:15.21]Yeah, upgrade it.
[05:17.72]It's gonna run out of ammo.
[05:20.60]Spencer is tiny!
[05:23.76]What, is the teleporter just gonna be like, super-sized?
[05:26.44]Yeah, let's see.
[05:29.12]Giant sentries are the best.
[05:31.87]Oh, God.
[05:33.07]I think that's it.
[05:34.07]Yeah, I think it's... Yeah, that's it.
[05:35.16]Yeah, fun's over.
