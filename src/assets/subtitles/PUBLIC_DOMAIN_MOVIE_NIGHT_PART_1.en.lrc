[00:00.23]The Gorilla, which is an hour long.
[00:03.13]And then we're going to do Plan 9 from Outer Space, which is an hour and 18 minutes.
[00:08.02]And then we're going to top it off with Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.
[00:15.16]Which is also about an hour and 18.
[00:21.67]So we're going to make a couple of rules here for how these are going to be watched.
[00:29.05]Do I get...
[00:32.11]At least two 30 second skip vetoes.
[00:41.11]Like I get to skip 30 seconds.
[00:46.09]No.
[00:47.85]Why?
[00:48.13]I don't know.
[00:52.33]I can skip like 20 seconds if I need to.
[00:55.95]We want to suffer.
[00:58.46]These movies are going to be good.
[01:00.00]Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is probably going to be a good movie.
[01:03.06]It's probably going to be a good movie.
[01:06.16]That's why I'm saving it for last.
[01:13.73]What's 30 seconds going to accomplish?
[01:15.91]I don't know.
[01:17.31]Skipping nudity that could be in one of these movies.
[01:20.47]I don't know.
[01:20.89]The second I see clothes come off, I'm skipping 30 seconds.
[01:22.74]Sorry, that's going to happen.
[01:28.22]That's what I'm talking about here.
[01:33.09]Santa's gonna be nude?
[01:34.19]I don't know.
[01:34.67]Are you guys ready?
[01:40.27]Are you ready for the first one?
[01:41.63]We've got the gorilla.
[01:43.41]And this is by... This is a horror comedy movie by the Ritz Brothers.
[01:49.31]You don't know who the Ritz Brothers are.
[01:51.38]They're the Three Stooges, but they're not the Three Stooges.
[01:55.35]They're just three guys that like, get out of here.
[01:58.95]And they hit each other in the head with stuff.
[02:01.41]It was pretty popular at the time.
[02:05.76]The three guys hit each other in the head with hammers and punch each other in the nose and pinch each other's ears was the Fortnite YouTuber.
[02:15.48]I mean, there's a lot of them.
[02:17.16]It was a lot of them.
[02:19.99]Like back in the 30s, this was like the YouTuber.
[02:23.08]This was like the influencer.
[02:24.06]This was like the Fortnite guy.
[02:27.82]So you're like, wait, how come there's so many Three Stooges copies?
[02:30.72]Well, you tell me.
[02:39.10]Not this again.
[02:43.96]That's a +2 hot take.
[02:45.92]No, it's not.
[02:46.52]That's just, what did we say?
[02:47.78]It's like the most popular game and everybody plays it.
[02:51.24]I don't play it, though, because I'm fucking, I do stuff, I do stuff, I do different, I do stuff different.
[02:55.92]I don't play Fortnite because I do things different.
[02:58.57]Right?
[03:00.57]$50 just came in.
[03:03.85]From brooding pyropterra.
[03:07.69]That's 5,000 bits.
[03:08.21]Thank you.
[03:10.28]Hi, Jerma.
[03:10.68]I'm sorry my last donation was worded so badly.
[03:12.78]I didn't mean for it to sound like that.
[03:14.20]The dream was that you were streaming, but also chat could talk on stream.
[03:18.62]And Kim was making fun of me for being louder than you and that people couldn't hear you.
[03:25.54]Anyways, thanks for being such a funny guy.
[03:27.06]I've been going through a shitty time recently.
[03:29.06]And having a laugh helps.
[03:29.96]Can we watch the Jimmy Neutron movie?
[03:32.22]That would be illegal.
[03:34.38]Jimmy Neutron is currently owned by, I believe, Viacom.
[03:37.46]And they keep coming out with stuff and it's not in public domain.
[03:40.01]I would get in a lot of trouble.
[03:40.89]I would get sued.
[03:42.51]We're going with non-sued movies.
[03:46.19]Not in public domain.
[03:47.01]It's unfortunate.
[03:49.59]Maybe in 75 years when it goes into public domain.
[03:52.15]We'll watch it.
[03:54.07]My grandson.
[03:55.45]Jerma Junior.
[03:59.07]Jerma Junior 985.
[04:00.30]When he's streaming in 100 years.
[04:02.80]You guys can watch that together.
[04:04.94]It'll be in public domain by then.
[04:08.58]Thanks for the $50.
[04:09.26]A lot of money.
[04:11.96]And with that, why don't we get started?
[04:14.76]I'm ready.
[04:15.92]How can you be ready?
[04:16.64]But I am.
[04:19.00]So I... So I can't skip at all.
[04:28.62]At all.
[04:33.37]Okay.
[04:34.63]Alright, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[04:37.63]Here we go.
[04:39.13]Here comes the gorilla.
[04:41.08]Starring the Ritz Brothers.
[04:46.19]Wait, we're gonna get like a countdown.
[04:54.50]Free.
[04:55.84]Alright, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[04:57.24]THX?
[04:57.38]Does THX sound...
[05:24.10]I'm so excited.
[05:28.40]The gorilla.
[05:29.32]Oh, the rich brothers.
[05:33.00]The three goofballs.
[05:44.60]It's too loud?
[05:52.20]Show your face.
[05:53.00]No, when you watch a movie, a guy's face isn't down in the corner.
[05:57.36]That's not how this works.
[06:02.42]I'm not part of the movie.
[06:05.43]Hey, 10 community subs.
[06:11.03]Thanks, SnakeCowboy, for the 10 subs.
[06:14.03]Alright, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[06:15.55]We gotta invert, oh hey, don't skip, immerse us in the movie, but please put a facecam 40% of the screen.
[06:22.53]Gorilla maniac, murderer, terrorizes suburb.
[06:28.95]There he is.
[06:31.63]Is that supposed to be a real, is it a real gorilla?
[06:34.17]Police baffled as the gorilla strikes again.
[06:37.88]Maniac murderer claims another victim.
[06:40.12]Is it just the zoo?
[06:41.58]Did he get out of the zoo?
[06:46.15]Let's just turn stricken as murderer makes good his threat a Hardest to catch a gorilla
[06:59.54]You have a gorilla?
[07:23.74]Why is he like reaching behind a desk to try to find dropped keys?
[07:25.96]I also read Romeo and Juliet in- What is this?
[07:26.98]Why are you praying to Romeo and Juliet?
[07:28.84]Just put a note on her?
[07:56.46]It's C4!
[07:57.18]Take it off!
[07:58.94]It's plastic explosion!
[08:02.26]He just has a hitman costume on.
[08:04.22]It's 47.
[08:04.40]Look how it's after me.
[08:23.93]Pick up a weapon!
[08:24.89]Why don't you take the note off and just see what it says?
[08:46.40]Wait, this is... Well, Kitty.
[08:49.21]What is all this racket about?
[08:51.57]Why is he fully dressed?
[09:18.45]Is he asleep in a suit?
[09:19.69]Walter Stevens, you are next to die.
[09:21.39]That didn't take very long.
[09:22.97]You didn't even do individual letters, you fucking hack.
[09:25.63]Should I call the police, sir?
[09:50.48]Yes, yes.
[09:51.02]Call them right away.
[09:55.51]Just a minute.
[09:57.71]I'll handle this my own way.
[09:59.09]Yes, sir.
[09:59.61]Only... But it's a gorilla.
[10:00.69]Only what?
[10:01.17]I was thinking of the time, sir.
[10:03.17]Time?
[10:03.79]According to the newspapers, the gorilla gives his victim only 24 hours notice.
[10:09.44]Only what?
[10:11.38]Nonsense.
[10:12.61]Why is he Amazon Prime?
[10:13.33]I don't understand.
[10:14.11]Gorilla Prime.
[10:14.85]That's a quick -2.
[10:43.27]I want those big, huge fucking cabinet doors.
[10:45.88]Hello?
[10:48.14]I begged you not to telephone me here.
[10:50.88]Yes, I know I promised, but you gave me until Monday.
[10:54.88]Saturday?
[10:56.06]Tomorrow?
[10:56.70]That's a debt collector.
[10:57.72]That's impossible.
[10:59.70]I can't possibly raise that amount of money.
[11:02.77]Yes, I know I owe it you, but a quarter of a million dollars?
[11:06.45]Be reasonable.
[11:11.11]Now, please be patient.
[11:13.58]I have a plan.
[11:15.20]But it's only just started.
[11:16.22]Give me time to work it out and I'll repay you dollar for dollar.
[11:20.14]If you don't repay, do they send the gorilla after you?
[11:29.91]That's kinda fucked up.
[11:33.69]Behind you, quick.
[11:35.13]Turn around.
[11:35.65]It's Bugleberry.
[11:46.36]I want to see the radiogram, please.
[11:49.03]To whom is the radiogram going, please?
[11:52.15]Miss Norma Denby, Diaz in Denver, aboard SS Paris.
[11:59.27]Regret unable to meet you at boat.
[12:02.98]Vitally important that I see you at my home tomorrow evening without fail.
[12:08.82]Smork.
[12:09.78]Sign it fondly, Uncle Walter.
[12:13.30]Make sure you put smork on it.
[12:15.37]Read that back, please.
[12:31.79]Rain was so hard to do back in, like, the 40s.
[12:33.17]They didn't invent rain.
[12:39.49]Rain wasn't even invented until the fucking 60s.
[12:41.07]I'm Norma Denby.
[12:46.67]Welcome to Oz, fuckface!
[12:51.18]Mr. Stevens is expecting you, Ms.
[12:52.56]Demby.
[12:52.74]May I take your coat?
[12:56.36]Oh, no, thank you.
[12:56.98]I'll keep it on.
[13:01.07]Who is this person, by the way?
[13:03.59]He likes it.
[13:04.21]He'd have to live in it.
[13:06.67]This way, please.
[13:13.49]Huge cabinet doors.
[13:14.41]I love them.
[13:14.81]Well, well, well, if it isn't the prodigal niece.
[13:19.46]Oh, it's swell seeing you again, darling.
[13:21.16]Was that her stepping down?
[13:22.40]She weighed like five metric tons?
[13:24.90]Good, I'm glad you did.
[13:25.64]This is Jack, Uncle Walter.
[13:27.74]This niece of mine isn't much of a correspondent.
[13:29.64]Well, a few letters she did write, though, were full of you.
[13:31.88]Congratulations, young man.
[13:33.00]Thank you, and I hope you'll excuse me for barging in like this.
[13:35.48]Nonsense, I'm delighted.
[13:37.14]I was more than personally surprised to hear that you set your marriage for June.
[13:39.70]Do you realize it's only a month away?
[13:42.30]Well, we decided we didn't want to rush things too much, so... So we put it off until... The day after tomorrow.
[13:49.19]The day after tomorrow.
[13:50.91]That's soon.
[13:52.07]Why, no, no, that's fine.
[13:56.23]That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about.
[13:59.01]But I'm forgetting my role as host.
[14:00.65]Sit down, my dear, sit down.
[14:04.23]We may as well come to the point.
[14:05.29]I can't get this suit off.
[14:07.21]Perhaps you'd rather talk to Norma alone, Mr. Seacrest.
[14:08.77]No, no, no.
[14:09.27]It's airtight.
[14:09.81]Help me.
[14:10.82]As Norma's future husband, what I have to say concerns you too.
[14:15.02]Now, as Norma knows...
[14:17.14]She and I were named joint heirs under the terms of her father's will.
[14:21.10]And until she marries, I'm the executive of her estate.
[14:24.64]But should anything happen to either of us, by then the survivor inherits the entire estate.
[14:30.09]And I think that you, Norma, and you, Jack, as her future husband, should know of what that estate consists.
[14:35.47]To that end, I've prepared a record of the estate's holdings.
[14:39.45]And I want to talk it over with you both after dinner.
[14:41.67]But your radiogram said there was something urgent.
[14:43.29]The fire feels so good.
[14:45.03]Yeah, I wouldn't want to be that close.
[14:48.28]I wouldn't have sent it.
[14:49.92]Something's worrying you.
[14:51.22]What is it, Uncle Walter?
[14:52.68]Well, perhaps I'm unduly alarmed, but last night I received... The black and white boomer face.
[14:57.98]From the gorilla.
[15:00.62]The gorilla?
[15:04.11]You mean that murderer, the one the papers have been so full of?
[15:06.81]I do.
[15:08.83]But isn't it possible that this is all just a joke?
[15:11.13]That someone's playing a prank on you?
[15:13.03]I wish I could think so.
[15:14.57]But Uncle Walden, why should he or anyone... Just tell him that you owe a quarter of a million dollars to the fucking IRS or whatever it is.
[15:19.64]It's possible that some old enemy of mine, I admit I've made enemies in my day, it's possible that one of them in a spirit of revenge has hired this maniac, this professional killer or whatever the gorilla is.
[15:30.95]But this note is exactly like the one that was in the newspapers after he murdered that widow.
[15:35.99]Stella, I can't bring myself to believe it.
[15:39.33]Of course, you've notified the police.
[15:42.05]No, I haven't.
[15:43.37]But surely if there was anything else... They never do this.
[15:45.11]I've taken other precautions.
[15:46.54]Peters and I are armed.
[15:48.20]And in addition, I've engaged the services of a private detective agency.
[15:51.64]Their operative should be here any moment now.
[15:53.46]No, of course not.
[15:54.28]I didn't call the police.
[15:55.96]I called three comedy dickheads that are going to bumble around and break stuff.
[15:59.95]And probably blow up the microwave.
[16:02.61]It is apparent that the workings of the police were an open book to him.
[16:05.51]Of course, there's a slim chance that by not notifying the police, we might upset his plans.
[16:11.29]Ordinarily, I'm not easily frightened, but I must admit this whole affair is giving me the creeps.
[16:17.00]Well, it's nearly nine o'clock, and I suppose you'll freshen up a bit.
[16:19.66]We'll talk it over after dinner.
[16:22.54]I thought about Craigslist.
[16:25.48]Kitty, show Miss Dimmie to the green room and Mr. Marsden to my room.
[16:29.29]Yes, sir.
[16:30.29]Don't worry, Uncle Walter.
[16:34.25]Oh, excuse me, Mr. Stevens.
[16:36.63]Yes, Kitty?
[16:37.31]Oh, I know it's customary to get noticed.
[16:39.47]No, no, black and white face game.
[16:40.29]Kitty, you're not trying to tell me you're going to leave me.
[16:42.35]Oh, no, sir.
[16:42.87]I'm trying to tell you I have left you.
[16:44.27]Kitty, you're perfectly safe here.
[16:46.10]What?
[16:46.52]Besides, we have guests.
[16:48.08]You haven't the heart to leave me now.
[16:50.16]Well, my heart is willing, but I'm going to have an awful time trying to convince the rest of my body.
[17:00.86]Oh, whoops.
[17:02.90]Whoopsie.
[17:03.62]We just drove into somebody.
[17:05.46]Hackney Detective Agency.
[17:06.80]Don't call the police.
[17:13.47]Call the three toddlers.
[17:25.03]What's the joke here?
[17:28.68]He can see through it?
[17:30.50]I'll bet there's a dead body in every room.
[17:32.60]Dead body won't reach you.
[17:34.44]Can't do you any good.
[17:35.24]It's a rain.
[17:36.48]I get it.
[17:36.78]Well, what are we waiting for?
[17:38.14]Let's go.
[17:38.84]Alright, who's going to slip in the water?
[17:40.80]Someone's going to slip and fall in the rain.
[17:41.96]Slip in the puddle.
[17:42.84]Step out and slip in the water.
[17:44.26]You get to rep it tonight, Chief.
[17:45.92]Make a note of that.
[17:47.08]Keep doing that once in a while.
[17:48.06]It keeps me on edge and thinking.
[17:49.19]Come on, kid.
[17:50.55]Slip in the water.
[17:51.15]Now, what do you suppose they want to take this for?
[17:52.83]I've got an idea.
[17:54.19]Let's go in and find out.
[17:55.23]You have to rep it, Chief.
[18:01.85]I love it I love it so far framer me why I'm Peter sir never mind that never mind that what's your name Peter sir just a minute just a minute where were you last night I beg your pardon oh so you did do something I don't like your looks what's that got to do with it this is no beauty contest
[18:33.66]Just not to flick a cigarette into the car's gas tank.
[18:36.48]I can't even, man.
[18:37.64]I keep thinking of the fucking stupid Kramer.
[18:46.69]The gun?
[18:47.15]Oh, Stevens.
[18:48.18]I am.
[18:48.84]I'm Harrigan.
[18:49.58]I'm Mulligan.
[18:50.20]I'm Garrity.
[18:51.44]Harrigan.
[18:52.20]Mulligan.
[18:53.64]Garrity.
[18:56.21]I'll save you because I need protection.
[18:57.35]What would you call yourself?
[18:58.37]The funny what?
[18:59.23]Now tell me, any clues?
[19:01.00]One very vital one.
[19:02.24]This warning from the gorilla.
[19:03.80]That's swell.
[19:04.30]You've got nothing to worry about.
[19:05.38]Mark that down, Garrity.
[19:06.42]Right.
[19:07.06]How do you spell gorilla?
[19:07.96]Two R's or two L's?
[19:09.52]Gorilla.
[19:09.96]I don't know.
[19:11.18]G-O-R.
[19:12.26]Two L's.
[19:13.28]G-O-O.
[19:14.78]G-O.
[19:15.90]Gorilla.
[19:16.28]Did you.
[19:17.84]Did you.
[19:18.83]Did you.
[19:21.06]Did you say... Gorilla?
[19:23.93]Why gentlemen are not afraid.
[19:25.25]The whole world we're not afraid.
[19:27.27]We just thought maybe if we... Thank you very much.
[19:29.75]The gorilla coming here?
[19:30.75]Why is the gorilla scarier than a fucking murderer?
[19:33.51]Quiet!
[19:34.49]Quiet!
[19:35.09]Oh, did you?
[19:36.03]Did you say an animal?
[19:38.03]Just an animal?
[19:38.81]Like a wild animal versus a murderer with motive?
[19:41.75]I think you'll find that every door and window is securely bolted.
[19:44.55]I couldn't have done better myself.
[19:46.20]With us on the job, Mr. Stevens, you've got nothing to worry about.
[19:48.56]What's your plan, Mr. Harrigan?
[19:50.26]Well, first we'll take a look around the house.
[19:51.68]Come on, then.
[19:52.16]Now, you just sit tight, Mr. Stevens.
[19:55.52]The gorilla will get you over our dead bodies.
[19:57.48]Dead bodies.
[20:01.76]It really is the Three Stooges.
[20:03.38]Just more articulate.
[20:10.95]Jack.
[20:11.87]Yes, darling?
[20:13.25]Who are those men?
[20:14.41]Probably the detectives your uncle hired.
[20:16.85]Jack, I'm terribly worried.
[20:18.39]What are we going to do?
[20:19.15]Well, it seems there isn't anything we can do yet.
[20:22.91]Listen, darling, it isn't that I'm trying to appear skeptical.
[20:25.83]It's just that, well, somehow I can't make myself believe all this.
[20:29.47]But that note, you saw the note.
[20:31.19]Of course I did, but still I... Look, darling, we'll wait.
[20:35.93]We'll wait and see if something really does happen.
[20:38.55]Three Redditors?
[20:39.59]I just don't believe it will.
[20:43.50]What's that?
[20:51.13]That's the gorilla.
[20:52.77]Excuse me, sir.
[20:54.43]I tried to put your car away, but unfortunately, there's something wrong with it.
[20:58.99]What do you mean?
[21:00.23]It won't start.
[21:01.91]Excuse me, sir.
[21:02.65]He gives me the creeps.
[21:09.19]No, that's the red herring.
[21:10.71]That's the red herring.
[21:11.45]It's not him.
[21:11.93]But I will smoke all of your cigarettes.

[22:28.82]Me?
[22:29.20]Why, I... Answer yes or no.
[22:30.46]Why, I ought to... What were you doing there?
[22:32.82]Doing where?
[22:33.42]Well, how do we know?
[22:34.54]Besides, I don't like your looks.
[22:36.16]Did you ever take a good look at yourself?
[22:37.60]Yeah, did you ever take a look... Hey, now, wait a minute, you.
[22:40.50]Where were you last night?
[22:41.94]I spent the night with Shakespeare.
[22:43.98]Yeah?
[22:44.44]Where is he?
[22:45.40]He's dead.
[22:47.26]Dead?
[22:48.32]A murder mystery.
[22:50.06]Have you any idea who did it?
[22:51.40]Look, Shakespeare's been dead hundreds of years.
[22:54.77]This is a fine time to call us in on the case.
[22:57.94]Say, but she couldn't have done it.
[22:59.54]How do you know?
[23:00.30]She can't be hundreds of years old.
[23:02.32]That's right.
[23:02.82]Mark that down, Gary.
[23:03.94]You two have a look out there.
[23:06.36]I'll look here.
[23:06.94]Yeah.
[23:09.00]Come on, break the sink and have water get all over you.
[23:20.27]What's this?
[23:20.75]That's a door.
[23:22.71]It leads to the back stairs.
[23:24.01]Back stairs?
[23:25.29]Well, remind me to have a look up there sometime.
[23:31.71]Boomer humor.
[23:34.91]That's an ironing board.
[23:36.21]Yes.
[23:38.40]That's an ironing board.
[23:39.88]Look, do you want this thing?
[23:42.32]Certainly we want it.
[23:43.20]What do you think we iron on?
[23:44.36]Hell, I...
[23:46.74]Well, here!
[23:47.24]Thank you!
[23:47.84]Harrigan!
[23:48.32]Harrigan!
[23:49.26]Harrigan!
[23:50.10]Come in here!
[23:51.46]We found it!
[23:52.32]What a psycho!
[23:53.14]We found what?
[23:53.52]The mystery.
[23:54.12]Well, that's hash.
[23:55.14]Ain't that a mystery?
[23:56.41]Some pretty good fighting, Chief.
[23:57.83]I'll be the judge of that.
[23:59.65]I'm afraid, gentlemen, you won't find the gorilla in there.
[24:04.31]Why will we not find the gorilla in there?
[24:07.92]Now, listen, you!
[24:08.92]I...
[24:14.09]Holy shit.
[24:14.41]Let me just grab both of his legs.
[24:17.39]That was insane.
[24:17.73]WWE.
[24:17.81]Do the iron again.
[24:18.27]Come on.
[24:44.17]I knew he was gonna- I think it's funny.
[24:45.53]I'm unironically laughing at this because it's just so stupid.
[24:48.39]Smoking at the table at dinner.
[24:49.15]God.
[25:13.19]Jack!
[25:14.01]What is it?
[25:14.87]What happened?
[25:17.03]Uncle Walter, are you hurt?
[25:18.78]I know.
[25:19.54]No.
[25:20.78]I don't know what happened.
[25:22.00]Look here.
[25:23.00]It seems to have been thrown in through that window.
[25:28.50]Uncle Walter, what are we going to do?
[25:33.94]The first thing we're going to do, or rather Jack is going to do, is to take you away from here.
[25:37.95]Well, you're coming with us.
[25:45.37]It's him!
[25:45.95]It's him!
[25:47.37]Aguilar there.
[25:48.95]Who is it?
[25:49.39]I don't know.
[25:52.09]He's making a handful of emote faces.
[25:54.25]It could be anybody.
[25:55.20]He's giving me a turn.
[25:59.32]Did you see that face?
[26:00.74]I bet when he gets drunk, snakes see him.
[26:04.64]What's the matter with you?
[26:05.36]You're scaring us half to death.
[26:06.56]I'm just trying to let you know I'm not the gorilla.
[26:11.25]This is my niece, Miss Stimby, and her fiancée, Mr. Marsden.
[26:14.55]Harrigan, Mulligan, and Garrity.
[26:16.75]Thank you.
[26:17.99]This battle seems to be much more serious than I thought.
[26:20.65]I've just received this from the guerrilla.
[26:22.07]A note.
[26:24.34]Who brought it?
[26:25.36]No one brought it.
[26:25.92]They threw me through that window.
[26:28.36]Through that window?
[26:29.40]Through that window.
[26:34.76]He's right.
[26:35.84]Wait a minute.
[26:38.30]This is my good ear.
[26:41.30]That was a good catch.
[26:42.34]Oh, say, that's right.
[26:43.20]You can't kid us.
[26:44.38]We were outside patrolling the grounds.
[26:46.17]What do you mean?
[26:47.49]Why, that note couldn't have come through that window.
[26:49.25]But why not?
[26:50.35]Well, I'll just show you.
[26:51.29]Stand back, man.
[26:54.95]That's why.
[26:55.45]But it was wrapped around a stone.
[26:58.41]A stone?
[26:59.29]Well, why didn't you say so?
[27:00.95]Anyway, what do you know about this thing?
[27:02.87]I don't know anything about it.
[27:04.21]We were preparing to leave the room and suddenly the lights went out and then there was a crash and... Oh, so the lights went out, huh?
[27:10.30]Make a note of that, Garrity.
[27:11.34]Right.
[27:12.48]You were outside a few minutes ago.
[27:13.70]Didn't you see anybody?
[27:15.04]Nobody but us.
[27:16.22]Make a note of that, Gary.
[27:17.28]At midnight?
[27:18.66]What time is it now?
[27:19.80]It's 10.30.
[27:20.00]I got 11.10.
[27:20.22]I got 11.30.
[27:20.38]It's exactly 11.45.
[27:21.20]Remind me to put some hands on this watch.
[27:27.95]I wonder if anybody dies.
[27:45.22]It's the gorilla.
[27:52.90]Wait, what?
[27:54.07]Uh-oh, he's loose.
[28:07.85]Smash some stuff.
[28:08.76]Come on.
[28:09.16]You know you want to.
[28:10.88]It's just a guy in a gorilla suit.
[28:16.60]Is it real?
[28:17.18]No, it's not a real gorilla.
[28:18.32]I don't know where that was supposed to be.
[28:30.03]Was it somebody's basement?
[28:41.69]That was a real ape.
[28:43.09]No, it wasn't.
[28:44.43]That scared the fucking shit out of me.
[28:47.59]Goddamn boomer jump scares.
[28:49.39]Lightning in every movie.
[29:02.60]Now that you're all here, I don't want anybody to move.
[29:04.78]Understand?
[29:06.00]Is it alright if I breathe?
[29:07.61]Yes, but come right back.
[29:09.63]Quiet!
[29:10.39]Personally, I don't believe the gorilla's coming here.
[29:12.53]Neither do I.
[29:14.38]Why not?
[29:15.78]It's funny.
[29:17.40]Harrigan, Mulligan and Garrity.
[29:19.35]It ain't enough.
[29:21.65]Now look here.
[29:23.08]Oh shit, a 5G tower!
[29:24.28]What?
[29:24.46]Who's even talking?
[29:52.35]all kramer all of them they're all they're all costanza and kramer combined into one person did you hear that I wish I didn't he's up there man where are you going I said he's up there that's what I thought you said oh quiet
[30:22.89]Alright, man.
[30:23.87]Follow me.
[30:26.98]Classic.
[30:27.76]Absolutely classic.
[30:28.94]It's Mr. X.
[30:54.83]Is it the gorilla?
[30:58.63]What happened?
[30:59.11]What was it?
[30:59.73]Nothing.
[31:00.11]Nothing at all.
[31:05.82]What?
[31:06.94]Did he just double-barrel shotgun kill something down there?
[31:09.12]That was like an I shot something with a shotgun sound.
[31:14.78]Hey.
[31:15.88]Did you just pass here?
[31:18.11]Yes.
[31:19.67]Yes, of course.
[31:20.47]I brought a trunk down from the attic.
[31:22.55]A trunk?
[31:23.29]Yes.
[31:23.97]Were we here?
[31:25.41]I couldn't say.
[31:27.60]Well, maybe we're not here now.
[31:30.76]Maybe.
[31:32.14]Maybe.
[31:32.88]Wait, is he the gorilla?
[31:35.14]It's two minutes of twelve.
[31:36.20]What about Uncle Walter?
[31:37.76]Uncle Walter, yes.
[31:39.22]Uncle Walter, we're just going in.
[31:41.69]Now, everybody!
[31:45.87]Stay just where you are.
[31:47.33]Get him in there.
[31:47.85]Gary, you watch that one.
[31:50.03]If this is an elaborate birthday prank, I'm going to be really upset at this movie.
[32:21.08]Happy birthday, Mr. Stevens.
[32:29.65]Someone's gonna die.
[32:32.97]I can't stand it any longer.
[32:34.09]I can't.
[32:34.83]You've got to call the police.
[32:35.89]You've got to.
[32:36.79]Mr. Stevens, I'm sorry, but Norm is right.
[32:39.01]I don't know what this is all about, but certainly if there's something to it, the police ought to know about it.
[32:44.32]I no longer know what to think.
[32:45.78]Perhaps you'd better.
[32:47.96]Hello?
[32:48.10]Hello?
[32:49.00]Hello?
[32:51.31]Lines cut.
[32:53.71]Phone, there's something wrong.
[32:56.35]Uncle Walter, he's gone.
[32:58.50]Gone?
[33:15.22]How can he be gone when every door and window in this room has been locked?
[33:17.46]I want to go check those windows.
[33:19.00]The butler just opened the door.
[33:20.56]The butler just came in.
[33:21.78]He wasn't in the... See?
[33:23.23]How did you get in here?
[33:24.39]Why?
[33:24.79]Through this door, sir.
[33:25.75]How can you when the doors are locked?
[33:27.13]I beg your pardon.
[33:27.93]It was not locked.
[33:28.87]I locked it myself.
[33:31.01]It is locked.
[33:31.85]That leaves us deadlocked.
[33:33.21]It would be impossible for me to walk through the woodwork.
[33:35.59]Why?
[33:36.31]Termites do.
[33:37.67]Oh, this isn't getting us anywhere.
[33:39.25]Now leave everything to me.
[33:40.79]The gorilla ain't going to make a monkey out of me.
[33:43.17]Shit.
[33:45.23]What is that supposed to mean?
[33:48.00]But who could- It has to be the butler.
[33:56.38]This is turning into Clue.
[34:14.79]Well, what are you waiting for?
[34:15.91]I don't know, but I wish I could think of something.
[34:17.57]Me too.
[34:18.59]I'll go on.
[34:20.35]Don't worry, darling.
[34:21.37]Oh, that's alright.
[34:22.17]I'll do all the worrying.
[34:23.51]Marsden, come with me.
[34:26.21]They keep separating it.
[34:27.13]You first, sir.
[34:27.97]Thank you very much.
[34:29.57]He's waving that gun around.
[34:31.69]Point that thing down, man.
[34:32.43]Why couldn't this have all happened tomorrow?
[34:34.15]What difference would that make?
[34:35.41]Tomorrow's my day off.
[34:38.11]Poor Uncle Walter.
[34:39.87]Right from under our very eyes.
[34:42.35]I don't understand how he got out of here.
[34:45.19]All that's worrying me is how I'm going to get out of here.
[34:47.25]He's going to kill her.
[34:48.73]Oh, it's him.
[34:50.37]It's him.
[34:50.86]I've seen him.
[34:51.72]I've seen him.
[34:52.76]It's the gorilla.
[34:53.88]I've seen him.
[34:54.44]I've seen him.
[34:55.34]What was that?
[34:55.90]I've seen him.
[34:56.44]It's the gorilla.
[34:57.34]I tell you, he's in that closet there.
[34:59.02]Oh, Jack, I'm so frightened.
[35:00.32]Alright, come on out of there, you.
[35:01.78]Get him, Mulligan.
[35:02.92]You heard him, Garrity.
[35:04.04]What did he say?
[35:05.30]Are you sure it wasn't a hallucination?
[35:07.63]Not unless a hallucination has hair on it.
[35:10.09]Come on.
[35:11.95]They can.
[35:12.61]They can.
[35:13.05]Ready?
[35:13.49]Yeah, Jack.
[35:17.57]That's obviously the gorilla.
[35:19.93]Who is he?
[35:21.43]I've never seen him before.
[35:22.79]Do you know him?
[35:24.11]No, sir, and this is no time for no introductions.
[35:27.38]He's not dead.
[35:28.78]Mark that down, too.
[35:29.90]Come on, darling, we're getting out of here.
[35:31.16]I'm afraid now, too, for you.
[35:33.40]It's him.
[35:34.96]Oh, Jack, it's horrible.
[35:36.66]I don't know what to make of it.
[35:38.02]All I can say is the gorilla's around here somewhere.
[35:39.88]I know Mr. Stevens is around here somewhere.
[35:42.78]And if you all look, we'll find him somewhere.
[35:44.98]Where are you going?
[35:45.70]Somewhere.
[35:46.96]Yes, there it is.
[35:48.86]You, lead the way.
[35:54.71]They said he's not dead.
[35:55.49]I'll take care of him.
[35:57.80]Get a basin of hot water.
[35:58.74]Do you mind if I go out of town to get it?
[36:01.16]Is that a Hillary Clinton statue over there?
[36:02.42]What was that?
[36:02.78]What is this?
[36:03.16]What is this, a Jervis dream?
[36:30.68]What's funny?
[36:32.02]Nothing.
[36:32.30]I think I'll have a look around this house.
[36:34.10]Have a look around the house?
[36:35.46]Yes, I have.
[36:36.22]Have a look around the house.
[36:37.52]Yeah.
[36:38.68]I'll go too.
[36:39.38]Yes, it is.
[36:39.84]Yeah, you're right.
[36:41.50]Hey, that guy won't talk.
[36:42.91]Why not?
[36:43.43]He's still unconscious.
[36:44.37]You're unconscious and you talk?
[36:45.71]That's great, Chief.
[36:47.23]Mark that down, Garrity.
[36:48.13]Right.
[36:48.55]What do we do now?
[36:49.43]Well, first we'll have to re-act the crime.
[36:50.65]I love these guys.
[36:51.37]Well, how do we do that?
[36:52.25]Now, let's see.
[36:52.83]When the lights went out, Stevens was sitting in that chair.
[36:56.03]You're Stevens.
[36:56.79]Sit down.
[36:57.59]I'm Stevens.
[36:57.99]Mulligan, close the doors.
[37:02.42]Hey, I'm Garrity.
[37:04.64]You're Stevens.
[37:05.32]Now sit down.
[37:06.66]I'll wait for lights.
[37:08.50]One.
[37:08.62]Oh, they're going to find it out.
[37:10.04]Two.
[37:11.48]Three.
[37:15.38]That's no use.
[37:17.85]I don't know what works for Sherlock Holmes.
[37:20.29]I don't know why it won't work for me.
[37:23.77]That's what I've been trying to tell you.
[37:25.39]He's gone.
[37:26.15]He's gone?
[37:26.53]Garrity!
[37:27.93]Garrity!
[37:29.17]Garrity!
[37:30.73]Now we have two mysteries to solve.
[37:33.13]I've got an idea.
[37:33.73]What is it?
[37:34.37]If we can find out how Garrity disappeared, we'll find out what happened to Stevens.
[37:37.45]You're sitting in that chair now.
[37:38.99]Should have thought of that myself.
[37:40.09]They're all going to sit in the chair, aren't they?
[37:42.15]Sit down.
[37:42.65]They're going to all disappear.
[37:44.15]You have to be tired to sit down?
[37:45.87]I do.
[37:47.09]You make me tired!
[37:48.33]Well, then, why don't you sit down?
[37:50.17]If I sit down, who's going to work the lights?
[37:52.07]I never thought of that.
[37:52.81]Yeah, well, sit down.
[37:54.17]Yeah, sit down.
[37:54.75]Sit down.
[37:55.37]One.
[38:01.62]Gone.
[38:01.88]It's the chair.
[38:03.34]He's gonna make her sit down.
[38:12.00]Do it.
[38:13.84]Yes!
[38:14.18]This guy's just fucking electric chairing everybody.
[38:31.14]Well, what am I going to do?
[38:33.75]That's just what I want to find out.
[38:35.17]He's killing everybody.
[38:46.51]One.
[38:46.71]Two.
[38:50.30]Two.
[38:52.16]Two.
[38:52.74]Two.
[38:54.34]Three.
[39:00.55]I can't hear somebody scream.
[39:06.35]Well, if you didn't, you ought to have your ears cleaned out.
[39:09.13]Say, where's Mr. Harrigan?
[39:11.02]The detective?
[39:12.34]He's disappeared.
[39:13.26]Disappeared?
[39:14.26]What a pity.
[39:15.40]Kill him right now.
[39:16.18]It's him.
[39:16.44]He's the killer.
[39:19.10]How did you get in here?
[39:20.92]Wait, why you?
[39:23.86]Oh, oh.
[39:24.42]Don't be frightened.
[39:25.82]You're safe with me.
[39:27.16]Safe with you, my eye.
[39:32.09]That's a good way to get out.
[39:39.86]Wait.
[39:40.12]Wait, was this a scam the whole time?
[39:58.71]Wait a minute.
[40:13.26]So where did the three Ritz Brothers go?
[40:17.63]Is he taking them out?
[40:18.29]Is everybody outside?
[40:19.01]Come on, Ritz.
[40:26.82]Come on, come on.
[40:39.75]So he just puts them in the closet.
[40:41.90]Hey, what's the matter?
[40:43.22]What's happened?
[40:44.20]Oh, look.
[40:46.78]I'm standing here.
[40:48.50]And all of a sudden, everything goes black.
[40:51.84]Next thing I know, I'm here.
[40:54.32]That's funny.
[40:57.65]Hello?
[40:57.99]Hello, I'm sorry, I kept you waiting.
[41:00.66]No, no, you turn on Willow Drive.
[41:02.18]You're not going to question who the person is?
[41:03.86]Off Highway 22 and hurry, will you?
[41:05.22]Thank you.
[41:05.60]Look, it ain't human, I tell you.
[41:08.28]It ain't human.
[41:10.34]What isn't human?
[41:12.04]For a guy to be standing here one minute, and the next minute, he's gone.
[41:16.88]Who's gone?
[41:17.78]I'm gone, they're gone, everybody's gone.
[41:20.12]It don't make sense.
[41:21.52]It certainly doesn't.
[41:22.60]Will you have a cigarette?
[41:23.64]I don't mind a five triple.
[41:26.06]That kidnaps me right from under his very eyes.
[41:28.65]Who does?
[41:29.53]The gorilla!
[41:34.95]Hey.
[41:37.01]Who are you?
[41:37.57]Watch that match.
[41:38.49]It's going to hurt.
[41:38.93]What do you want?
[41:40.05]What are you doing here?
[41:41.33]Listen, old man, you got me all wrong.
[41:43.81]I just came in to use the telephone.
[41:45.34]You see, my car broke down.
[41:46.60]That phone?
[41:47.72]Yeah.
[41:47.94]Look, that phone is out of order.
[41:51.16]Is it?
[41:51.66]Yes.
[41:58.57]Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.
[42:00.59]You bastard, you pranked me.
[42:02.07]You electrified him.
[42:03.59]You're the gorilla.
[42:04.43]Surely you don't think I'm the gorilla.
[42:05.91]Shoot him.
[42:06.21]I stopped thinking two hours ago.
[42:07.57]But you don't understand.
[42:08.37]I don't have to understand.
[42:10.41]Shall I try it?
[42:11.29]Oh, you've tried enough.
[42:12.25]Now get him up.
[42:13.07]Listen, you're making a big mistake.
[42:14.81]Well, it won't be the first time.
[42:17.73]What the fuck just happened?
[42:22.60]Did he just like, did he just kick him in the balls?
[42:26.56]What just happened?
[42:31.57]What just happened?
[42:33.81]Alright.
[42:34.85]Alright, I got you covered.
[42:36.26]Help!
[42:37.44]Okay, shake him off.
[42:38.52]Shake him off.
[42:40.14]Help!
[42:41.70]Help!
[42:43.30]Hello, help!
[42:45.66]Wait, the safe.
[42:46.34]The safe is always behind the picture.
[42:49.17]Help!
[42:51.01]Oh, shit, he knows the secret passages.
[42:52.77]Help!
[42:52.87]Help!
[43:00.41]for a second I thought that was the guy that just left through the secret passage I was like what the he just took his hat off everybody's in that closet that's like that's the hitman storage closet
[43:30.41]This is just what happens when the NPCs wake up when you leave the level.
[43:33.87]Six?
[43:34.05]He's making that up.
[44:00.58]Six of them.
[44:00.94]That was like a million dollars, by the way.
[44:30.91]I think it's funny.
[44:32.83]Whatever.
[44:34.03]It's fucking stupid.
[44:34.87]Didn't he see the bookcase open?
[44:36.83]I thought he saw this happen.
[44:41.13]Yeah.
[44:59.15]Oh, must be out there.
[45:00.39]Come on, man.
[45:00.93]Right out here.
[45:02.79]Oh, he's yelling for help.
[45:07.97]Right, right, right.
[45:08.43]Alright, cover the door, man.
[45:11.39]What's the matter with all of you?
[45:12.38]Are you deaf?
[45:13.18]I've been pounding on that door for the last ten minutes.
[45:15.36]Who are you?
[45:16.54]That's right.
[45:17.22]Who are you?
[45:18.08]Never mind who I am.
[45:19.58]I want to know where Walter Stevens is.
[45:21.32]New characters being introduced late in the game here.
[45:24.24]He wants to know where Walter Stevens is.
[45:25.87]Who do you think we're looking for?
[45:27.37]I didn't come here to play games.
[45:29.23]I want to see Walter Stevens and I want to see him right now.
[45:31.47]But you don't understand.
[45:32.29]These gentlemen are detectives.
[45:33.41]Detectives.
[45:34.23]Bah!
[45:35.11]What are you trying to pull on me?
[45:36.57]I talked to Stevens on the telephone last night.
[45:38.60]He told me he had a plan to pay his debt.
[45:40.38]Plan?
[45:40.98]Yeah, said he'd only just started working on it.
[45:43.44]Did he tell you what this plan is?
[45:44.84]I wasn't interested.
[45:46.26]He was to square up with me here tonight.
[45:49.12]Quarter of a million dollars, that's a lot of money for 1939.
[45:58.52]Now, look here.
[45:59.60]I don't know who any of you are, but I do know this.
[46:03.19]Walter Stevens owes me $250,000.
[46:05.65]And I'm going to collect it tonight or else.
[46:10.09]That's a pretty good WWF promo pointing.
[46:13.74]I'm going to get out there and I'm going to fucking bury Hulk Hogan into the ground.
[46:19.86]I gave him until tonight to return my money.
[46:22.48]And I'm not going to leave this house until I get it.
[46:25.49]Yeah, but wait a minute.
[46:29.21]I think he's mad.
[46:30.53]Jack, if what that man says is true, I... I don't believe Uncle Walter could... It's almost impossible to know what to believe, darling.
[46:39.08]Yet things are adding up.
[46:40.66]If your uncle did have a plan,
[46:42.65]I'll tell you something mean, Gene.
[46:44.47]You're not strong enough to do that, honey.
[46:45.95]I have to crush your ego here a little.
[47:07.30]He's a simp.
[47:08.48]You know, I feel sorry for that poor girl.
[47:10.74]Yeah?
[47:11.24]What about poor us?
[47:12.21]Strange men zooming in and out, animals running around like this was a zoo.
[47:15.49]Crazy gongs on.
[47:16.55]I want to go home.
[47:17.39]Oh, so you want to go home.
[47:19.05]I'm ashamed of you.
[47:20.39]I'm ashamed of you!
[47:21.93]Do you want to take a run-out pod and leave that girl here to take the blame alone?
[47:25.54]We're detectives, aren't we?
[47:27.20]Are we?
[47:28.80]Haven't we looked all over this house?
[47:30.24]Yes.
[47:30.70]No.
[47:31.50]Where haven't we looked?
[47:32.46]Well, if there's a cellar, we haven't looked there.
[47:34.70]One fucking door, we haven't looked at it.
[47:36.64]What the fuck is the gorilla?
[47:38.80]I don't understand the whole- Why is this movie called The Gorilla?
[47:42.66]She was just in a cage.
[48:02.66]Wait, is he going to sell the gorilla to him for $250,000?
[48:04.76]Is that the plan?
[48:08.72]Alright, come on out of there, you.
[48:11.16]Come on, get out of there.
[48:13.32]Alright, come on out of there.
[48:15.45]Alright, come on.
[48:17.85]Alright, come on out of there.
[48:28.29]What?
[48:30.35]That's some Silent Hill shit right there.
[48:31.95]Where are you?
[48:32.87]I'm right here, Chief.
[48:37.92]I'm going to turn on your radio.
[48:39.10]Where are you?
[48:39.98]Is it making weird sounds?
[48:41.06]Over here, Chief.
[48:45.30]Is anybody with me?
[48:46.74]No, you're alone.
[48:49.22]Awful.
[49:08.64]It takes work to do that.
[49:11.08]Kill!
[49:14.86]Oh!
[49:15.18]Hey, Harrigan!
[49:16.48]Something bit me!
[49:18.62]What?
[49:19.58]First time I saw a mousetrap catch a piece of cheese.
[49:21.58]Harrigan!
[49:24.44]Coyote!
[49:25.20]Come here and get me out of this!
[49:27.56]Get me out of this thing!
[49:28.74]What?
[49:29.52]Maybe it's like a racket.
[49:30.74]Oh, come on.
[49:31.26]What are you doing?
[49:32.02]I'm watching you.
[49:32.59]You're bothering me.
[49:35.13]Wait, what?
[49:52.00]Now, don't worry.
[49:53.18]I'll handle this.
[49:53.92]It's a pleasure.
[49:54.46]Man, don't worry about it.
[49:55.66]Why are they not scared?
[49:56.64]Come on, Buck.
[49:58.10]Get that raccoon coat off.
[49:59.50]Come on.
[50:01.34]Get that thing off.
[50:02.24]I hit you over the head with this thing.
[50:11.81]We've been double-crossed.
[50:12.93]Oh, it's Superman.
[50:15.59]Bending the metal rod.
[50:20.92]Hit.
[50:25.98]No, no, that's a support beam.
[50:27.48]Don't do that.
[50:30.01]Why would you show your strength?
[50:40.03]That's so funny.
[50:41.37]The real gorilla.
[50:42.67]No, thank you.
[50:56.13]I'll drink this poison.
[51:05.39]What?
[51:08.71]Uh... What the hell is he doing?
[51:13.73]There are plenty of ways to do this without making like a scary face.
[51:16.82]You know, like, hey, do you want your coat?
[51:19.02]Instead of leaning in with your mouth open.
[51:20.70]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[51:23.28]Here comes a suit of armor joke, definitely.
[51:24.62]I don't... Oh, there's two gorillas.
[51:26.20]There's two gorillas, without a doubt.
[52:00.23]Oh, thank goodness you caught her!
[52:10.86]You heard her, Mulligan.
[52:11.82]So did you.
[52:12.56]Never mind that.
[52:13.58]You take the hall.
[52:14.30]I'll go this way.
[52:16.09]I'll stay here.
[52:21.59]Is something wrong?
[52:22.79]Where were you?
[52:24.02]I just went to get some tea, sir.
[52:25.70]Didn't I tell you to stay here with Miss Denby?
[52:27.52]I'm very sorry, sir, but I thought perhaps a little tea.
[52:30.52]What right have you got to think?
[52:32.01]We're not even thinking.
[52:34.19]Miss Denby might have been killed.
[52:35.87]It's fortunate she wasn't, sir.
[52:37.91]This guy's too calm.
[52:39.05]I don't trust him.
[52:39.61]Why is it that something always happens when you're not here?
[52:42.97]An unfortunate coincidence, sir.
[52:47.16]What did you find?
[52:47.80]An empty closet with Harrogate in it.
[52:54.28]no he got you that's pretty good voice crack voice crack that's right I forgot what's that funny tapping
[53:24.79]Ugh.
[53:24.89]This is back in the day when you had to do it for real.
[53:53.05]Look, I've had about enough of this.
[53:56.67]Me and the gorilla is going to have a showdown right now.
[53:59.35]That's right, Chief.
[54:00.35]I'm telling you I can't stand it.
[54:02.32]Now don't argue with me.
[54:03.92]I know what I'm talking about.
[54:05.56]I'm going in there and we'll look over this house.
[54:07.80]You'll take orders from me.
[54:08.82]Here comes the showdown.
[54:09.88]Now I'm going to tear this house apart.
[54:11.96]Tear it limb from limb.
[54:13.42]Now come on, follow me.
[54:17.62]I'll show this mug who's a mug.
[54:19.94]You fellas stick close behind me.
[54:23.93]If anything happens, leave it to me.
[54:26.16]I'll do all the talking.
[54:27.64]Come on, man.
[54:29.10]People running in here all day long.
[54:31.34]I've never seen anything like this in all my life.
[54:35.20]Why is he just a guy?
[54:38.40]He's a guy, like, pointing at shit.
[54:43.75]What's he to you?
[54:44.53]What have you got there?
[54:55.70]Dane would smell something or she wouldn't be running away like that.
[54:57.92]Make a note of that, Garrity.
[55:00.04]Clap him.
[55:02.08]Slap him in the face.
[55:03.97]YouTuber noises.
[55:32.62]gonna kill him with an umbrella that's not gonna work now here's a random guy that's still in the movie somehow where's he been he's been hiding inside the walls what do you want don't be frightened frightened who's frightened don't you come near me I'll wrap this thing around your neck like it was a pretzel there's nothing to worry about that's what you think may I give you some advice no
[55:56.86]He's gonna throw him out the window.
[55:58.46]God, I hope the gorilla throws this guy out the window.
[56:21.72]I want to see the gorilla do at least one full haymaker punch into somebody's face, right?
[56:25.04]Like, I mean, we have to see it.
[56:26.60]Please.
[56:31.95]Or a suplex.
[56:32.55]Yeah, anything.
[56:33.43]A wrestling move.
[56:35.55]I'll take a frying pan.
[56:36.69]Like, the gorilla hits somebody with a frying pan.
[56:38.57]Please.
[56:43.03]Or somebody hits the gorilla in the face with a frying pan, and it doesn't affect him.
[56:45.91]And it's like, oh, that didn't work!
[56:47.69]And they get all panicked.
[56:49.13]I'll take that.
[57:09.36]That ain't a man.
[57:10.47]It's a gorilla.
[57:11.43]We saw it and we felt it.
[57:12.53]When I tell you the gorilla is a man, I ought to know.
[57:14.31]I've read enough about him.
[57:15.45]But how could a monkey have possibly written those notes to Uncle Walter?
[57:18.74]Maybe it's got an education.
[57:20.02]Umbrella joke.
[57:24.84]Where is he?
[57:25.26]Have any of you seen him?
[57:26.10]Who?
[57:26.58]Poe.
[57:27.08]Who's Poe?
[57:27.72]Poe's the gorilla.
[57:28.66]The gorilla?
[57:29.20]Oh, you know him too, huh?
[57:30.49]Know him.
[57:30.85]I trained him since he was that high.
[57:32.35]You're just the one we're looking for.
[57:33.97]Don't any of you understand?
[57:35.19]Poe is a gorilla, a trained gorilla.
[57:37.07]A real gorilla?
[57:38.11]Sure a real gorilla.
[57:39.89]So we don't know what we're talking about, eh?
[57:41.65]Yeah, we know a monkey when we see one.
[57:43.83]Listen, this is serious.
[57:44.98]Poe ain't no pet.
[57:46.16]There's no telling what he's liable to do when I ain't around.
[57:48.82]He's trained.
[57:49.84]He hates women.
[57:50.72]What's he doing here?
[57:51.52]What are you doing here?
[57:52.56]We was hired to come here.
[57:53.72]We're working at the county fair.
[57:55.46]Yesterday a guy comes along, says he wants me to bring Poe here.
[57:58.79]He says he's giving a party, wants us to put on a act.
[58:01.11]Who hired you?
[58:02.17]I don't know.
[58:02.95]I don't know nothing.
[58:04.17]All I know is I bring Poe here, we're waiting out in the garage like he tells me.
[58:07.51]Waiting to do our stuff.
[58:08.89]All of a sudden somebody gives me a clunk over the head and I wake up to a lady's boudoir.
[58:12.00]But the gorilla, how did he get loose?
[58:13.48]You're asking me.
[58:14.20]That's what I want to find out.
[58:15.86]Listen, this is serious.
[58:16.78]We've got to find them.
[58:17.98]We've got to.
[58:18.46]Somebody's liable to get killed.
[58:19.86]Them notes from the gorilla.
[58:21.44]I'll get you.
[58:21.92]You can see they're addressed to me.
[58:23.54]Notes?
[58:24.50]Poe can't write no notes.
[58:25.87]Even I don't know how to write.
[58:27.03]Now look, the next time I buck up against that gorilla, I'm telling you, I'll... Well, you'll never know.
[58:34.39]He'll do it.
[58:35.13]Listen, have you seen him?
[58:36.35]Yes, he's in the kitchen.
[58:37.49]Which way is the kitchen?
[58:38.45]Through the panel.
[58:39.61]We'll go with you.
[58:44.07]Listen to me, everybody.
[58:44.87]The gorilla has done his work.
[58:48.03]Walter Stevens is dead.
[58:51.90]You will find his body in the garage.
[58:54.28]Alright, everybody.
[58:54.70]Follow me to the garage.
[58:56.10]Come on.
[59:12.80]Doesn't sound very enthusiastic about it.
[59:16.18]You'll find his body in the garage.
[59:18.24]Also, for lunch today, will be Salisbury steak.
[59:20.66]We need the big reveal.
[59:21.30]You couldn't save Uncle Walter.
[59:22.42]We couldn't, eh?
[59:43.03]Well, you didn't, did you?
[59:46.22]That's right, we didn't.
[59:48.28]I gotta find out how that gorilla gets in and out of here.
[59:50.32]There must be a secret spring around here someplace.
[59:54.86]I think I'll look in the back of these books.
[59:57.59]He's gonna get grabbed.
[59:58.67]He's gonna pull the right one.
[60:00.47]And he's gonna go, whoa!
[60:01.13]What the fuck?
[60:02.53]What the fuck?
[60:17.42]Imagine getting hit in the head with a fucking brass statue as hard as somebody could do it.
[60:21.02]Just turned you into a goofball for five seconds.
[60:32.31]He's dead.
[60:43.93]walk the Jerma walk alright see there's two gorillas here we go flash up the here comes the gorillas it's a guy with a gorilla arm it's gonna be a scooby-doo don't tell me she's the gorilla I told you I didn't like her looks oh wise guy come on we gotta find the boss

[61:12.96]Look under the mat.
[61:15.82]That's funny.
[61:17.08]Oh, very funny.
[61:18.59]Will you get me out of here?
[61:20.27]Listen, what are you doing in Poe's cage?
[61:22.13]What do you think I'm doing, waiting for someone to feed me peanuts?
[61:25.35]Get me out of here!
[61:27.13]Don't you know Poe hates women?
[61:28.77]So does Kipling.
[61:29.77]So what?
[61:30.33]Will you please get me out of here?
[61:33.03]Wait, what?
[61:33.37]Hold on, wait, what?
[61:34.37]Alright, alright, don't get excited.
[61:36.03]Poe hates women.
[61:38.04]Paul hates women.
[61:38.50]Whoa, what?
[61:38.83]Holy shit!
[61:39.09]What the fuck?
[62:06.87]He's got her.
[62:07.85]Wait, don't go near him.
[62:08.53]He'll drop her.
[62:09.79]Pull.
[62:10.61]Bring it down, pull.
[62:11.95]Bring it down to me.
[62:13.77]Down, pull.
[62:14.35]Down to the ground.
[62:16.01]Put it down, pull.
[62:16.71]Why is he holding this lady?
[62:18.67]Down, pull.
[62:19.25]Down to the ground.
[62:20.97]Pull.
[62:21.31]Stop it, pull.
[62:23.85]Bring it down, pull.
[62:25.23]Bring it down to me.
[62:29.23]Put it down, pull.
[62:30.13]Come on.
[62:43.59]How do you catch a gorilla like that?
[62:50.10]What the fuck?
[62:56.90]Oh no, he made it in.
[62:59.60]He knows he's the fake gorilla.
[63:01.50]Break through, you can do it.
[63:04.22]Stone cold.
[63:08.51]Stone cold.
[63:12.28]Oh, the gorilla was the good guy all along.
[63:14.37]Thank you.
[63:15.93]He hit me again.
[63:18.65]Right here he hit.
[63:22.07]Let him alone.
[63:27.56]That's an anti-hero gorilla.
[63:29.46]After I give you the best years of my life, you act like that.
[63:34.54]Listen here.
[63:37.69]No, no.
[63:38.39]No kisses.
[63:39.88]He might have killed somebody.
[63:41.24]What do you mean, might have?
[63:45.26]Damn it.
[63:48.36]No!
[63:49.30]It's alright, lady.
[63:50.06]I got him.
[63:50.62]You can keep him.
[63:52.03]Okay.
[63:52.67]Scram and take this character with you.
[63:54.41]Has this lady been awake for a third of this movie?
[63:58.33]Oh, that's just the A-N-D-Y.
[64:00.37]Sorry if I caused you any trouble, folks.
[64:02.89]And just for that, I don't need you to funny papers tonight.
[64:05.75]I'll put you in bed without any supper, you baby.
[64:13.72]You wait till I get you home.
[64:15.69]You have to wait until after this.
[64:18.41]Go on.
[64:21.51]Look at that.
[64:22.91]That's so stupid.
[64:24.41]Wait, it's somebody's coat.
[64:27.36]Alright, come on out of there, buddy.
[64:28.56]But that's how I got clunked on the head.
[64:30.90]Come on, come on out of there, you.
[64:32.26]I got the slap I was looking for.
[64:33.82]It's opening.
[64:35.40]Come on, come on.
[64:37.49]Oh, so it's you.
[64:38.79]Do you know him?
[64:39.59]Do I know him?
[64:40.11]He's the guy I caught using the telephone.
[64:41.66]There's no law against that.
[64:43.00]Never mind law, but I get him on it.
[64:44.44]Just a minute.
[64:45.10]Don't you think you're a little premature?
[64:46.68]Premature?
[64:47.44]Well, I can't remember that far back.
[64:49.30]Just who are you?
[64:50.62]I'm Detective Coletti, an investigator for the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[64:55.55]What?
[64:55.73]And I'm on the trail of the Gorilla just as you are.
[64:58.03]A detective?
[64:59.07]How do we know that?
[65:00.81]Securities fraud?
[65:02.31]Well, what were you doing in there?
[65:04.47]Investigating.
[65:05.85]I've been on this case for some weeks now, and I've discovered a little about the construction of this house that my good friend here don't seem to have found out yet.
[65:15.75]Insider trading.
[65:17.25]This house is a maze of secret panels.
[65:20.47]Now, undoubtedly, the voice of the gorilla came through that radio from someplace right in this house.
[65:24.57]That means that if we find the wire leading away from the radio, we'd at least find the gorilla's hideout.
[65:28.80]It's going to be the guy that owns the house.
[65:30.56]Security's fraud.
[65:31.66]Insider trading.
[65:41.55]His big plan.
[65:45.51]Just as I thought.
[65:47.11]Here's the wire.
[65:48.21]Now by tracing this, I think we may find the answer to this entire riddle.
[65:53.06]The wire goes in here.
[65:54.98]Back of this wall is the man we want.
[65:56.64]Here comes the third gorilla.
[65:58.08]That'd be funny.
[65:58.62]Are you all armed?
[65:59.48]Yes, I'm armed.
[66:07.82]Why is he tied up?
[66:08.70]Uh oh.
[66:09.40]Third gorilla theory incoming.
[66:40.88]What?
[66:41.98]Why, it's Mr. Stevens.
[66:43.52]Alias, the gorilla.
[66:44.86]The gorilla?
[66:46.46]Him?
[66:48.44]Oh, I'll never trust another man if I live to be a thousand.
[66:51.57]You can make that two thousand.
[66:53.65]Uncle Walter, the gorilla.
[66:57.03]I don't believe it.
[66:58.35]I think I can make it very clear.
[67:00.27]Oh, sure we can.
[67:01.27]Now, first of all, what's that?
[67:03.35]Uh-oh.
[67:03.89]I didn't hear a thing.
[67:04.73]Neither did I, but what was it?
[67:06.01]You'll soon find out.
[67:08.89]Hey, what is this?
[67:10.42]Who hit me?
[67:11.58]What's going on around here?
[67:12.92]It's that man again.
[67:14.00]Oh, there you are.
[67:15.30]Kidnapped.
[67:15.96]Kidnapped by the gorilla.
[67:17.36]Not kidnapped by the gorilla, mister.
[67:19.40]Conway.
[67:19.96]A.P.
[67:20.40]Conway.
[67:21.08]The A.P.
[67:21.77]stands for ape.
[67:22.95]Mr. Conway, this gentleman is the gorilla.
[67:25.53]The gorilla?
[67:26.49]But if Uncle Walter's the gorilla... Well, hasn't the gorilla been killing people?
[67:30.55]Oh, the gorilla's been killing people.
[67:33.33]The beginning of the movie.
[67:34.72]...and to throw off suspicion from himself.
[67:36.88]Miss Denby...
[67:38.23]Under the terms of your father's will, if anything were to happen to you... This dude's a terrorist.
[67:43.42]Uncle Walter.
[67:45.02]My hunch was right.
[67:46.54]Your uncle brought you here tonight to kill you for your money.
[67:49.97]Well, at least he had a reason.
[67:51.79]So that's why he wouldn't let us call the police.
[67:53.81]That's exactly why.
[67:55.07]But what about these men, these private detectives?
[67:57.64]They almost speak for themselves.
[67:59.90]Do you think if Steven's life had actually been threatened, he would have called in three morons such as these?
[68:05.72]Holy shit.
[68:07.36]Hey, wait a minute.
[68:10.58]I resent that.
[68:11.84]But I tell you, I saw the gorilla right there in that closet.
[68:14.62]I saw his hand and his arm and it was no optical confusion.
[68:17.68]What you saw was this sleeve.
[68:20.64]Another ingenious little invention of Mr. Steven's.
[68:24.50]Very cute little idea.
[68:26.34]Well, that about clears the whole matter up.
[68:30.16]And since it stopped raining, I think I better go.
[68:33.27]You're okay, buddy.
[68:35.11]Congratulations.
[68:35.87]Let me congratulate you.
[68:36.91]Thanks for calling us morons.
[68:39.23]Wait a minute.
[68:41.94]I know you don't, buddy.
[68:43.53]okay folks say howdy to the gorilla howdy what alright give out well this moron is gonna blow your brains out well you see it was over there he just has a really hairy hand alright but the cops haven't been able to get me so don't you halfwits get any crazy notions and that's what Stevens he's just as crooked as I told you he was the trouble with him is he talks too much and too loud
[69:06.87]I got tip-top on what was going to happen here tonight.
[69:09.09]How he was going to pretend to be me.
[69:10.87]I was going to get the $250,000 and at the same time let him get the blame for all the guerrilla murders.
[69:16.97]You better be careful.
[69:17.65]You could have just said I haven't been manscaping lately.
[69:20.87]Then you'd be fine.
[69:21.59]I'm nervous tonight.
[69:22.71]Grab that gun.
[69:23.85]And I advise you not to move.
[69:28.19]Hello.
[69:30.33]Police station.
[69:30.81]Quickly.
[69:31.43]What is this?
[69:31.91]I thought the phone was out of order.
[69:33.25]Maybe he paid his bill.
[69:34.17]Hello.
[69:34.91]This is Walter Stevens speaking.
[69:36.85]They're all gorilla.
[69:49.54]Don't look so sad, darling.
[69:51.18]Your uncle isn't a crook.
[69:51.98]Here comes the real reveal.
[69:52.96]It's all safe and sound now.
[69:55.08]You know, you never can tell.
[69:56.30]This is liable to wind up to be a mystery.
[69:58.10]You see, the guerrilla murders were threatened to bank up our insurance company.
[70:01.22]Most of the victims were clients of ours.
[70:03.12]So Conway, our special investigator, cooked up his little scheme to trap the killer.
[70:07.36]I'm sorry I had to frighten you, dear.
[70:09.20]And you too, Kitty.
[70:10.24]Oh, I wasn't frightened.
[70:11.81]I was numb.
[70:12.85]You fellas are certainly great detectives.
[70:14.79]Oh, yes.
[70:15.49]We could have told you that.
[70:16.85]Did you know that Clutty was the gorilla all along?
[70:18.63]Sure we did.
[70:19.99]No, we didn't.
[70:20.87]When did you find out he was the gorilla?
[70:22.38]When I shook hands with him.
[70:23.70]I don't get you.
[70:24.38]Well, you see, I was a window trimmer in a department store.
[70:27.32]And I ought to know a phony feel when I feel one.
[70:30.85]We'll never be able to thank you, Mr. Harrigan.
[70:32.32]Oh, that's alright.
[70:33.12]What does that even mean?
[70:34.08]I understand you two are getting married soon.
[70:36.00]Well, if you call tomorrow soon.
[70:37.74]Well, remember, if you have any trouble with her, our specialty is following wives.
[70:46.67]You know where to send the check.
[70:48.01]And be sure it's certified.
[70:49.45]From a confetti bank.
[70:55.03]Oh, what was it?
[70:56.74]Bye.
[70:57.70]Oh, that's good.
[70:58.44]I love the bye.
[71:01.61]The end.
[71:02.17]Frankentine meets the space monster.
[71:10.75]Well, that's going to have to be for a different time.
[71:16.69]That was very... I loved it.
[71:20.39]I loved it.
[71:21.03]We're going to take a little intermission break.
[71:27.14]I'm going to get another drink.
[71:29.43]And we're going to come back with this plan from Outer Space 9.
[71:32.75]Whatever the hell it is.
[71:33.72]I'll be right back.
[71:38.09]Get a popcorn refill if you want to.
[71:39.39]See you in a minute.
[76:04.28]Let's go down to the movies.
[76:06.64]Let's go down to the movies.
[76:09.21]Let's go down to the movies.
[76:12.19]And grab ourselves some stuff.
[76:13.71]Is that what you guys are doing?
[76:18.27]Wrong lyrics?
[76:19.17]What?
[76:24.44]$50 from Phylactery, which is 5,000 bits.
[76:29.13]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[76:30.89]They said, the movie was unironically funny to me.
[76:32.73]What a gem.
[76:33.79]Reminds me of the old Three Stooges.
[76:35.91]I can't believe the last line of the movie was, buy.
[76:42.63]Uh, we're gonna have to take that as a, uh, I think as a tip.
[76:48.10]We're gonna have to watch more fucking Ritz Brothers movies.
[76:52.52]That's the first taste of the, I think a lot of the Ritz Brothers movies are in public domain.
[76:58.26]I can't wait to see them as the tag team in the next Jerma Rumble.
[77:00.82]Three-way tag.
[77:02.72]Interesting.
[77:04.26]Alright, coming up next we have... Uh, this is, this is, uh, a lot of you have probably already heard of this before.
[77:10.15]This is Plan 9 from Outer Space.
[77:11.75]This is an old shitty movie.
[77:15.45]Uh, it's gonna be the middle movie of the night.
[77:22.18]How many characters confirmed for the Rumble?
[77:23.88]That's a great question.
[77:28.17]I think that was a perfect movie.
[77:30.85]It was an hour.
[77:36.59]Ritz Movethon.
[77:37.97]Only Ritz movies.
[77:40.49]Well, here comes Plan 9 from Outer Space.
[77:44.12]Of all the weird movies, I've only seen probably 20 minutes of this movie.
[77:51.06]I know it's a total fucking joke.
[77:53.14]The whole thing sucks.
[77:54.48]I know.
[77:56.45]So, we're just going to watch it.
[78:03.63]This movie is in video games.
[78:05.51]Yeah.
[78:06.45]This movie has nudity?
[78:09.22]Where?
[78:09.98]What?
[78:12.18]Is there nudity in this movie?
[78:18.44]No, there's not.
[78:19.29]What?
[78:23.66]Alright, I'm gonna hate this movie.
[78:25.12]This is not a Ritz Brothers movie, so, I mean, I'm not gonna like it.
[78:31.96]Thanks, Lazy Purple, for the raid.
[78:33.42]Welcome, everybody.
[78:34.62]We're about to watch... We're about to watch Plan 9 from Outer Space.
[78:41.33]Public Domain Movie Night.
[78:42.25]Thanks for the fucking raid.
[78:43.79]Lazy Purple, welcome, and all the viewers.
[78:45.55]What do you say we get started?
[78:49.31]I'm ready for a countdown.
[78:50.25]Plan 9 from Outer Space.
[78:56.33]Welcome, guys.
[78:57.37]You joined just in time, but you did just miss the gorilla.
[79:04.47]Here we go.
[79:06.27]In three, two, one.
[79:15.08]A little loud.
[79:16.90]It's a little loud, I'll turn it down.
[79:18.44]An NBC movie?
[79:33.16]Greetings, my friend.
[79:35.04]We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.
[79:41.79]And remember, my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.
[79:47.63]You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.
[79:54.24]That is why you are here.
[79:56.16]And now for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened on that fateful day.
[80:03.56]Why does this feel like a bad Trump impression?
[80:06.56]Based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal.
[80:14.29]The incidents, the places, my friend, we cannot keep
[80:19.65]I feel like I bought this on Fiverr.
[80:20.83]Jesus Christ.
[80:21.27]I'm telling you, this is the jump scare.
[80:23.45]You just have lightning and loud sounds.
[80:51.56]Plan 9 from outer space.
[80:57.29]Copyright, it don't matter anymore.
[80:59.21]This shit is free.
[81:16.10]Director of Photography, William C. Thompson.
[81:28.10]All characters and events depicted in this podcast are fictitious.
[81:30.56]Any similarity to actual persons living or dead is purely coincidental.
[81:34.34]Why did they do a South Park opening for that?
[81:45.59]Of course, Ed Wood.
[81:46.57]Yeah, yeah.
[81:47.37]Worst fucking director ever.
[81:54.81]All of us on this Earth
[81:56.62]know that there is a time to live and that there is a time to die.
[82:01.18]There's a time to live.
[82:02.12]Yet death is always a shock to those left behind.
[82:05.89]And your time has come.
[82:06.99]It is even more of a shock when death, the proud brother, comes suddenly without warning.
[82:15.39]Just at sundown, a small group gathered in silent prayer around the newly opened grave are the beloved wife of an elderly man
[82:25.98]sundown of the day he's reading this whole thing in his head they're waiting for him to start of the old man's heart oh sorry shadows of grief god I was doing that in my head his very reason come on junior start already I should have done the funeral over the saddened group left the graveside
[82:55.96]Who died?
[82:56.40]This is a fucked up grave site, by the way.
[83:02.75]They don't even... What?
[83:17.51]I feel like they're about to break into song.
[83:21.94]Is this a musical?
[83:23.52]Are they gonna like start tap dancing?
[83:30.21]Yep, right on schedule.
[83:31.22]There's the old San Fernando Valley out there now.
[83:34.46]You'd better radio in for landing instructions that evening.
[83:37.68]Right, Jeff.
[83:39.30]Burbank Tower, this is American Flight 812.
[83:42.22]Over.
[83:43.56]Wouldn't surprise me any if he's asleep this time of the morning.
[83:46.07]American Flight 812, this is Burbank Tower.
[83:51.01]If I were asleep, you'd never get on the ground.
[83:52.97]In your case, maybe you're right.
[83:55.33]Why is he wearing a seatbelt and the other guy's not?
[83:56.87]You got me that time, Mac.
[83:58.13]This American flight 812 requests... Burbank Tower to American flight 812.
[84:10.28]Over.
[84:11.60]Burbank Tower to American flight 812.
[84:13.46]Over.
[84:13.64]There's a shower curtain behind them.
[84:15.76]Holy mackerel.
[84:16.62]Burbank Tower to American flight 812.
[84:17.98]It would be fucking hilarious if they pulled that back and a guy was taking a shower right there.
[84:22.22]Oh, damn it.
[84:22.74]Take a look for yourself.
[84:28.13]What are those steering wheels?
[84:29.77]Thats the plane?
[85:06.51]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[85:16.92]Did you hear anything?
[85:18.66]I thought I did.
[85:19.52]Don't like hearing noises.
[85:20.90]Especially when there ain't supposed to be any.
[85:23.05]Yeah, sort of spooky like.
[85:25.97]Maybe we're getting old.
[85:27.19]Whatever it is, it's gone now.
[85:29.13]That's the best thing for us too.
[85:30.35]Gone.
[85:30.59]It's like I'm watching a bad lip reading video.
[85:33.95]Am I sure that's not what this is?
[85:34.89]Did I click the right thing?
[85:43.02]Oh, look at those hands.
[86:08.14]The grief of his wife's death became greater and greater agony.
[86:12.88]The home they had so long shared together became a tomb.
[86:24.74]This is sad.
[86:25.70]A sweet memory of her joyous living.
[86:30.56]The sky to which she had once looked was now only a covering for her dead body.
[86:37.88]The ever beautiful flowers she had planted with her own hands became nothing more than the lost roses of her cheeks.
[87:07.41]Confused by his great loss, the old man left that home, never to return again.
[87:14.97]Wait, did he sell it?
[87:22.51]Wait, did he move his furniture out?
[87:28.24]At the funeral of the old man, unknown to his mourners, his dead wife was watching.
[87:37.10]First his wife, then he.
[87:39.22]Tragic.
[87:40.79]Why is that door only like five feet tall?
[87:42.45]Why was his wife buried in the ground?
[87:44.15]Clown car.
[87:46.47]Something to do with family tradition.
[87:48.09]A superstition of some sort.
[87:50.31]Oh.
[87:51.25]Well, it's getting dark.
[87:52.64]Let's be in our way.
[87:58.68]Then as two of his mourners left his final resting place,
[88:06.66]You dummies.
[88:09.29]Wait, why couldn't they just lie on the ground?
[88:12.15]What's the... I don't understand.
[88:14.19]The actors couldn't lie on the ground for a second.
[88:17.17]Why?
[88:22.29]Somebody had to make that shit.
[88:24.40]It took probably three or four days to make that.
[88:28.76]They were too old to lie on the ground.
[88:35.08]No, one of them was like 40.
[88:37.52]I don't buy that for a second.
[88:38.50]Minutes later, the police, led by Inspector Daniel Clay, arrived at the scene.
[88:43.49]Who found them?
[88:45.07]The man and girl.
[88:46.77]Medical examiner... Where's the gorilla?
[88:49.69]Just left.
[88:50.61]The morgue wagon ought to be along most any time.
[88:53.36]You get their statement?
[88:55.30]Yeah, much as we could.
[88:57.02]They're pretty scared.
[88:59.28]Finding a mess like this ought to make anyone frightened.
[89:03.05]Have one of the boys take the guy and the girl back to town.
[89:06.83]You take charge.
[89:07.70]Oh, dude.
[89:08.12]Okay, Inspector.
[89:09.04]What are you going to do?
[89:10.10]Look around a little.
[89:10.88]It's pretty dark out there.
[89:12.80]What?
[89:13.32]Once you get beyond the range of those lights, you won't be able to see your hand in front of your face.
[89:16.60]This is an SNL skit.
[89:17.68]That's Dan Aykroyd in the middle.
[89:20.00]Be careful, Clay.
[89:21.00]I'm a big boy now, Johnny.
[89:41.59]smoke.
[89:45.41]You guys think that's fog?
[89:46.43]No, no, no.
[89:46.87]This is what the 30s looked like.
[89:48.29]Every motherfucker smoked.
[89:50.45]50s.
[89:51.65]Yeah, whatever.
[90:10.06]This was every bar and restaurant in fucking 1955.
[90:12.44]It looks like a bobcat tore into them.
[90:22.75]Yeah.
[90:28.29]Say, Lieutenant, did you get that funny odor?
[90:31.61]How could I miss it?
[90:35.49]Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now.
[90:39.01]I thought they were dummies.
[90:40.01]I thought they were fucking mannequins.
[90:41.59]I was about to say, why?
[90:43.01]A lot of police cars and lights.
[90:45.23]I stopped, but I didn't see anything.
[90:48.11]Oh, well, whatever it is.
[90:49.49]It's a mosquito.
[90:57.87]The fence?
[90:58.55]You seem to still be up there somewhere.
[91:00.68]Yeah, that's pretty fucked up.
[91:02.38]Maybe I am.
[91:03.28]Why does it sound bent?
[91:04.24]I don't think I've ever seen you in this mood before.
[91:08.90]It's made out of cardboard.
[91:09.74]I guess it's because I've never been in this mood before.
[91:17.63]Something about your flight?
[91:21.79]Dude, even his clothes look fake.
[91:23.25]Like, his shirt looks like it's made out of fucking cardboard.
[91:32.68]I saw a flying saucer.
[91:34.68]Saucer?
[91:36.88]You mean the kind from up there?
[91:38.86]Yeah, it's a counterpart.
[91:41.66]It was shaped like a huge cigar.
[91:43.66]Dan and Edith saw it too.
[91:45.52]When it passed over, the whole compartment lighted up with a blinding glare.
[91:48.90]You mean the sky?
[91:49.64]Yeah.
[91:50.06]Tremendous wind.
[91:50.90]It practically knocked us off our course.
[91:52.94]Did you report it?
[91:54.01]Yeah.
[91:54.99]It radioed in immediately, and they said, we'll keep it quiet until you land.
[91:58.69]As soon as we landed, big army brass grabbed us and made us swear to secrecy about the whole thing.
[92:03.71]Oh, it burns me up.
[92:06.17]These things have been seen for years.
[92:07.57]They're here.
[92:08.05]It's a fact.
[92:09.38]And the public ought to know about it.
[92:10.96]There must be something more you can do about it.
[92:13.23]Only there isn't.
[92:14.43]All but what's the use of making a fuss.
[92:17.15]But last night I saw a flying object that couldn't have possibly been from this planet.
[92:22.20]Honey, you should make a bunch of Facebook posts about it.
[92:24.20]A muzzle by Army brass.
[92:26.66]I can't even admit I saw the thing.
[92:46.67]Rumor.
[92:53.77]Oh no!
[92:54.25]Look out!
[92:55.11]Toys!
[92:55.73]Angie's here!
[92:56.37]Is anybody gonna say anything?
[93:13.45]Say something!
[93:22.38]Somebody talk.
[93:24.22]I can't just be me.
[93:24.96]Oh, you know he's a villain when he holds his arm up and gets his nose.
[93:49.10]With a big cape.
[94:00.14]It's the butler again.
[94:01.52]Oh god.
[94:02.64]Where are all the officers?
[94:04.44]Where is everybody?
[94:23.54]Shoot him with your gun.
[94:30.83]Sounds like Kay's in trouble.
[94:39.41]Uh-oh.
[94:42.20]That apparition we saw had something to do with it.
[94:43.96]Come on.
[94:48.96]Paula and Russell.
[94:50.14]Oh no, he's dead.
[94:55.17]Somebody said N.A.
[94:56.33]Aim.
[94:56.51]Oh, God.
[95:04.49]Oh, looks like he wanted me invited to TSM.
[95:08.67]Is he dead?
[95:10.21]Yeah.
[95:12.90]He's messed up as bad as those two back there.
[95:16.60]Suppose that saucer or whatever it was had something to do with this.
[95:20.78]Yeah, I guess as good as mine, Larry.
[95:23.27]Don't itch your neck with a gun.
[95:24.59]Oh, my God.
[95:25.63]What are you doing?
[95:27.90]He's going to kill himself.
[95:29.34]Put it down.
[95:32.08]You're in charge now, Lieutenant.
[95:34.26]Yeah, I am.
[95:35.58]This is, like, freaking me the fuck out.
[95:37.04]He's got his finger on the trigger, and he's itching his neck with the barrel of the gun.
[95:39.83]Tell the coroner he's got to make another trip out here.
[95:42.65]Well, how about the lab boys?
[95:44.37]Who do you think we left back at the car?
[95:46.51]Boy Scouts?
[95:48.15]Come on, Lincoln.
[95:53.75]Oh, no, another funeral.
[95:55.01]It's just three this fucking same day.
[95:57.45]...than to lay down his life for another.
[96:01.65]It is always difficult to have last words over the grave of a friend.
[96:07.34]And Inspector Daniel Clay was a friend.
[96:11.12]A dear friend to me and to all of us.
[96:13.80]By the way, who's the scary lady in makeup and costume?
[96:19.34]Now we lay him to rest.
[96:22.60]A rest well-deserved, but so premature.
[96:28.98]She's at the funeral.
[96:31.41]There's more than one flying saucer?
[96:39.25]People turning south from the freeway were startled when they saw three flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.
[96:50.43]just pointing out the window look saucer scene over Hollywood whoa it's not a rainbow in the sky telephones the police well look there's a rainbow forming over there kind of cool I guess
[97:18.80]Why was that so hard?
[97:27.56]Like his shit face.
[97:28.52]There comes a time in each man's life when he can't even believe his own eyes.
[97:37.65]Okay.
[97:38.27]Saucers seen over Hollywood.
[97:43.31]Flying saucers seen over Washington, D.C.
[97:52.97]Get the military.
[97:54.35]Missile launchers?
[98:05.54]Already?
[98:09.36]Rockets were quickly set up.
[98:11.50]Colonel Tom Edwards in charge of saucer field activities was to make the greatest decision of his career.
[98:18.65]He made that decision.
[98:20.83]Colonel Edwards gave the signal to fire.
[98:25.51]And all of them missed.
[98:34.32]Not one rocket hit its location target.
[98:37.48]In the chat you could see
[98:49.81]Nice air shot, noob.
[99:04.49]Malding.
[99:07.28]He must be pretending.
[99:09.44]Is the entire United States military pretending?
[99:14.22]These were the things that the local citizens were saying.
[99:27.46]Then as swiftly as they had come, they were gone.
[99:31.50]Even to the piercing eye of radar and the speeding jet fighters.
[99:35.94]They weren't even moving.
[99:36.93]They were standing still.
[99:38.89]Even I could do that.
[99:43.37]Quite a sight, wasn't it, sir?
[99:45.05]A sight I'd rather not be seeing.
[99:47.23]Are you worried about them, sir?
[99:48.79]No, I'm worried about your comedy radio.
[99:51.32]Visits?
[99:51.70]That would indicate visitors.
[99:55.44]When?
[99:55.62]Where?
[99:55.98]That's a made-up government conspiracy.
[100:15.28]Never heard about that, sir.
[100:16.66]Alright, I need to rewind.
[100:19.10]I'm rewinding.
[100:20.38]What the fuck did he say?
[100:21.82]A sight I'd rather not be seeing.
[100:24.20]Are you worried about them, sir?
[100:25.77]Well, they must have a reason for their visits.
[100:28.29]Visits?
[100:28.67]That would indicate visitors.
[100:31.05]They killed people.
[100:31.67]They died.
[100:32.67]I made this up right now to justify firing 10,000 missiles at them that were $500 million.
[100:38.46]For a time, we tried to contact them by radio, but no response.
[100:43.34]Then they attacked a town.
[100:45.92]A small town, I'll admit.
[100:47.68]But nevertheless, a town of people.
[100:50.00]People who died.
[100:50.94]I never heard about that, sir.
[100:53.75]Well, it was covered up by the higher echelon.
[100:57.75]Take any fire.
[100:58.91]And that's all I need to say to get another $500 billion in revenue.
[101:02.57]Then wonder.
[101:04.85]Flying saucers, Captain, are still a rumor.
[101:08.40]Officially.
[101:12.62]Looks like we beat them off again, sir.
[101:14.74]What do they want?
[101:15.83]Where are they from?
[101:17.58]Where are they going?
[101:19.86]They, sir?
[101:20.96]Who?
[101:21.20]Well, this is a training maneuver, sir.
[101:24.40]We only did a little practice firing at the clouds.
[101:27.36]What?
[101:28.90]Yeah.
[101:30.58]I wonder what their next move will be.
[101:33.54]So they were deliberately not hitting them.
[101:36.97]Are you sure you can't use some of the tax dollars to rebuild a few schools?
[101:44.29]Really, guys?
[101:46.21]What will their next move be?
[101:53.81]Your space commander has returned from Earth.
[101:56.74]Send him in.
[101:57.72]Wait, they're just people?
[102:04.66]It's a race of Bob Hope?
[102:07.50]We had to pull in here to Space Station 7 for regeneration.
[102:10.68]We're returning to the planet Earth immediately thereafter.
[102:14.69]What progress has been made?
[102:16.39]We contacted government officials.
[102:18.37]They refuse our existence.
[102:21.98]What plan will you follow now?
[102:23.98]Plan 9.
[102:25.38]It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures.
[102:28.48]Their soul is too controlled.
[102:32.48]Plan 9.
[102:34.58]Ah, yes.
[102:35.34]Plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead.
[102:38.83]Long-distance Electrode shortens the pineal and pituitary glands of recent dead.
[102:43.88]Have you attempted any of this plan as yet?
[102:45.80]Yes, Excellency.
[102:47.28]How successful... I want one of these costumes.
[102:49.81]We have risen too so far.
[102:51.59]We shall be just as successful on more.
[102:54.83]The living, they have no suspicion of your movements.
[102:58.83]We had to dispose of one policeman.
[103:00.91]However, none of those risen have been seen.
[103:03.58]At least not by anyone who still remains alive.
[103:06.64]It's too bad it must be handled this way.
[103:10.34]But it must...
[103:11.67]Those who we take from the grave... We can't wait for that fucking curtain to open and it's Mario 3.
[103:17.18]Continue on.
[103:18.40]Report to me in two Earth days.
[103:25.04]I feared His Excellency wouldn't take our report this well.
[103:27.67]Well, had he been dealing with our own people, his reaction would have been completely different.
[103:31.65]He understands the difficulties of the Earth race.
[103:34.28]What do you think will be the next obstacle the Earth people will put in our way?
[103:37.59]What's she gonna draw?
[103:38.53]What's she gonna draw on them?
[103:39.51]As long as they can think, we'll have our problems.
[103:42.73]But those whom we're using cannot think.
[103:44.89]They are the dead, brought to a simulated life by our Electrode guns.
[103:49.71]Oh.
[103:50.46]You know, it's an interesting thing when you consider the Earth people who can think are so frightened by those who cannot.
[103:58.08]The dead.
[103:59.18]They didn't even think to, like, put them in makeup or something?
[104:02.96]They just have different clothes on.
[104:04.20]How are they aliens?
[104:06.42]They're just like, we're just people with clothes on.
[104:10.14]These earthlings, which we, all of us are in this room.
[104:14.75]The producers didn't think to dye our hair green.
[104:38.03]Where's the TIE fighter sound?
[104:45.07]Hello, honey.
[104:55.07]I'm back from the set wall where there's nothing behind us.
[104:59.07]I still think you ought to go in town and stay with your mother until I get back.
[105:04.39]This is our home and nothing's going to take me from it.
[105:08.12]Besides, most men try and keep their wives from going home to mama.
[105:12.52]That's not the point.
[105:13.80]That's all the point there's going to be.
[105:16.69]Why is he leaving for work at night?
[105:18.59]I don't pick for work at night, man.
[105:20.59]What are you talking about?
[105:22.69]That's a weird kiss.
[105:27.23]That was like a... He fucked that up.
[105:30.83]Wait a minute.
[105:31.28]Wait a minute.
[105:31.96]Hold on.
[105:34.48]Will you tell him to pick another house to buzz?
[105:37.23]Watch this kiss.
[105:38.41]That was, he fucking missed that so much.
[105:41.90]He like opened his bottom lip and right now she's thinking, fuck, that was so wet and gross.
[105:51.66]I can't wait to fucking wipe my arm on my mouth when he says cut.
[105:54.17]But I'll be locked up in there.
[106:03.86]What the fuck are they doing?
[106:05.28]What are you doing?
[106:06.92]Is this the first time they've ever kissed a human?
[106:10.24]These are the aliens.
[106:12.04]These are the aliens down here.
[106:13.81]I figured it out.
[106:14.71]I know the whole movie.
[106:16.79]Well, I have to have something to keep me company while you're away.
[106:21.85]Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely, I reach over and touch it.
[106:27.81]Then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore.
[106:30.03]Wait, do you reach up and touch his what?
[106:34.11]What?
[106:39.88]Who are you touching?
[106:42.76]What's going on?
[106:50.92]These humans are... These are not humans.
[106:54.48]That hurt.
[106:55.52]That hurt both of them.
[106:56.86]They both are in pain right now.
[106:58.12]Physical pain.
[107:01.51]You could see three distinct rolls on the side of his face.
[107:04.47]That hurt them.
[107:06.07]There's pressure.
[107:06.49]What the...
[107:22.00]If you're especially nice, I may even lock the side door.
[107:25.83]Hey, make sure you smoke in the house.
[107:26.85]Make sure you keep the yard lights on.
[107:29.03]Smoke everywhere.
[107:31.93]Don't worry.
[107:32.53]The yellow stains on the fucking ceiling and the walls 30 years from now won't drop the property value of our home.
[107:38.33]No, I wouldn't.
[107:51.25]Is that a clock in the top left or a plate?
[107:54.47]I don't know.
[107:55.07]That's a weird clock.
[108:11.57]It's a clock.
[108:12.63]There's nothing wrong between you two.
[108:14.47]Oh, no, nothing like that.
[108:15.51]It's just that I'm worried.
[108:16.93]She being there alone and those strange things flying over the house and those incidents in the graveyard these past few days has just got me worried.
[108:24.57]Well, maybe they haven't figured out those crazy skybirds yet, but I give you a 50 to 1 odds the police have cleared out that cemetery thing by now.
[108:31.32]I hope so.
[108:32.26]If you're really that worried, Jeff, why don't you radio in and find out?
[108:34.88]I really wish you would let me on your fucking Animal Crossing island to sell my turnips, Jake.
[108:41.04]Kinda fucking annoying that you haven't invited me yet.
[108:43.16]Didn't want to bring it up, but I will.
[108:52.11]How about you and me balling it up in Albuquerque?
[108:54.19]Albuquerque?
[108:54.87]Have you read that flight schedule, boy?
[108:56.69]What about it?
[108:57.55]Well, that was relevant.
[108:58.27]Albuquerque at 4 a.m.
[108:59.92]That's strictly a 9 o'clock town.
[109:01.84]Well, I know a friend that'll help us.
[109:03.64]Let's have the problem first.
[109:05.02]Huh, Danny?
[109:05.68]Oh, he's worried about Paula.
[109:07.68]I read about that cemetery business.
[109:08.84]Shit.
[109:08.94]Alright.
[109:09.14]Let's take the loss.
[109:10.26]Trying to get two kids not to buy too near one of those things.
[109:13.54]We get there soon enough as it is.
[109:15.68]He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there.
[109:17.70]No doubt about that.
[109:18.90]It's quiet alright, like a tomb.
[109:21.85]I'm sorry, Jeff.
[109:22.67]That was a bad joke.
[109:24.19]Say, I almost forgot what I came in here for.
[109:25.75]Me too.
[109:25.96]I know what it's like.
[109:26.50]How's the coffee situation?
[109:28.10]That's for me.
[109:28.68]It sure wouldn't hurt to think it is.
[109:30.86]Okay, be right back.
[109:32.14]And say, Jeff, make that call to Mac.
[109:34.46]Nah, not only did she throw cold water on my Albuquerque clam, but now she's repeating herself.
[109:38.98]Can someone put their fucking hands on the wheel?
[109:41.24]I can't resist your charm, Danny boy.
[109:50.19]Residents near the cemetery paid little attention to the blast of thunder and the flash of lightning.
[109:57.61]But from the blast arose the moving figure of the dead old man.
[110:03.03]This looks like a deep fake.
[110:09.09]It's like a Richard Nixon deep fake.
[110:12.88]How embarrassing if we put Richard Nixon's face on here.
[110:23.71]Is that a hospital bed?
[110:24.45]Is that a bed?
[110:24.95]Why is a fire alarm your ringtone?
[110:30.56]Hello?
[110:32.20]Who?
[110:34.02]Mac?
[110:35.78]Well, hi Mac.
[110:38.68]Sure I'm alright.
[110:40.88]I just fell asleep.
[110:44.76]Tell Jeff I'm alright.
[110:48.29]Okay, Mac.
[110:50.51]Thanks for calling.
[110:52.57]Look at that picture up there.
[110:54.07]That's not... Look.
[110:57.17]That's not even the two people that live in this house.
[111:01.05]These are two random fucking people.
[111:03.19]Would I believe that's her and him?
[111:05.15]Nope.
[111:05.67]That's two random people.
[111:09.74]I don't know who the fuck they are.
[111:20.78]They're squ...
[111:32.72]What?
[111:35.62]Hello?
[111:37.70]Who?
[111:39.32]Wait, what?
[111:40.32]Am I going fucking crazy?
[111:41.65]Hi, Mac.
[111:42.89]Am I going insane?
[111:43.99]Sure, I'm alright.
[111:55.73]That's not even the- that's a superimposed photo!
[111:59.67]Is it?
[112:01.97]That's not even the picture that's there!
[112:07.96]What the fuck?
[112:13.10]Deep fake.
[112:23.66]Okay, I could take this guy.
[112:24.94]I'll pick up a lamp and hit him in the fucking head.
[112:26.86]You know what I mean?
[112:28.36]Like, if you're just putting your hand on your mouth and going like this.
[112:31.53]No, give me the phone.
[112:32.65]I'll fucking bash you in the head with that phone.
[112:37.03]And apparently, they live right next to a graveyard?
[112:40.65]They live on the graveyard.
[112:43.12]Holy shit, we're talking property value.
[112:44.94]Cigarette smoke, graveyard.
[112:46.22]This house was $40.
[112:58.81]They got this house at auction.
[113:06.56]Why was it?
[113:07.04]Yeah, what?
[113:08.38]Wasn't it just nighttime?
[113:09.79]Why is it daytime?
[113:12.85]Alright, this lady is doing the I have a dump in my pants walk.
[113:18.82]Like, this is the walk you do when you shit your pants.
[113:24.76]You freeze and you fucking just slowly just move your hands up and down and move shimmy.
[113:31.78]Did it go through the underwear into my pants?
[113:34.68]I hope it's just the underwear because I can take those off.
[113:37.34]I can take the underwear off and put the pants back on, but fuck, hopefully it didn't go through.
[113:51.83]This Darth Vader...
[113:55.33]There's a Vader up there.
[113:56.91]I was stuck there.
[114:00.99]It's a beautiful beverage.
[114:04.01]The egg.
[114:25.90]Kinda does look like the egg, huh?
[114:27.30]Why are you running through the graveyard?
[114:31.66]Get to a road.
[114:54.86]Finally, thank you.
[114:55.86]Um.
[114:56.72]Wait, he knows who this is?
[115:23.61]This dude, he's talking about the egg.
[115:33.20]That's the egg right there.
[115:34.46]Like the tucked in, the pants pulled up like Steve Urkel with tucked in.
[115:39.46]That's the egg.
[115:40.02]Okay, run him over.
[115:52.88]Just drive over that guy's head.
[115:54.44]Pump into him, run over his head.
[115:58.76]I bet you'll probably get cursed forever or something, right?
[116:00.74]Yeah, that's not a good idea.
[116:05.93]Why am I getting like the holy shit psycho face?
[116:08.05]This is Dracula.
[116:09.37]Run his fucking head over.
[116:11.53]What, that makes me a psycho?
[116:13.97]Run over that guy's head.
[116:15.27]He's a Dracula psycho killer guy.
[116:18.73]What?
[116:18.99]I'm trying to get rid of him.
[116:24.47]No, I'll go ask him for directions, guys.
[116:26.13]That's a good idea.
[116:30.89]Are we going to get another funeral?
[116:38.67]Oh.
[116:56.36]That's a home video camera pointing at him.
[116:58.84]He's testing out his cosplay for the next convention.
[117:04.01]That was not meant to be released to the public at all.
[117:14.98]His iCloud got hacked.
[117:16.68]It's unfortunate.
[117:29.57]They'll be at the hatch in a moment.
[117:31.65]You can open it now, Tana.
[117:36.89]So we're back in the UFO?
[117:42.98]Where does that ladder go?
[117:51.78]You're late for dinner, you three.
[117:54.64]Turn off the electrodes quickly.
[117:56.04]They can't tell us from anyone else.
[118:03.05]Oh, Brussels sprouts again, Mom?
[118:07.22]Sit down and eat.
[118:23.55]It's tough to find something when you don't know what you're looking for.
[118:25.91]I don't think the lieutenant does either.
[118:27.55]Then what are we doing out here?
[118:29.21]I was off duty an hour ago.
[118:30.81]Oh, don't ask me any questions.
[118:32.31]I'm just a hard hand just like you.
[118:41.92]Cole Phelps?
[118:42.92]What do you suppose that noise was?
[118:44.68]Whatever it was, it's no more strange than the other things happening around this cemetery.
[118:49.24]Spirits like old Farmer Caller talked about.
[118:51.88]Well, maybe.
[118:53.17]The only spirits he saw tonight were those I smelled on his breath.
[118:56.23]Don't forget, Mrs. Trent claims to have seen them too.
[118:58.71]She didn't have anything on her breath.
[119:00.39]She was hysterical.
[119:01.89]True, she was frightened and in a state of shock.
[119:05.01]But don't forget that torn nightgown and the scratched feet.
[119:09.55]Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.
[119:14.06]Guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant and I'm still a uniformed cop.
[119:18.41]Sometimes it's only the brakes, Larry.
[119:19.97]See, we don't give a shit.
[119:20.77]Like, how far can you fit this gun down your mouth?
[119:22.61]Let me check.
[119:23.53]Let me do it, too.
[119:24.71]We don't give a fuck.
[119:25.83]No more than you do.
[119:26.91]When for orders, I get out of here right now.
[119:28.95]It was a saucer.
[119:29.77]A flying saucer?
[119:30.89]What makes you say that?
[119:31.69]Do you remember the noise we heard the other night?
[119:34.31]We were knocked to the ground.
[119:35.47]How could I forget?
[119:36.73]Exactly.
[119:37.55]But you're not remembering that sound.
[119:40.53]There you're wrong, Lieutenant.
[119:42.33]I'm with the fact the sound is similar, but what about the blinding light?
[119:46.39]Oh, haven't you heard?
[119:47.82]And many times a saucer hasn't had a glow or a light of any kind for that matter.
[119:53.12]That proves it.
[119:54.26]What next, Lieutenant?
[119:55.78]I want him to take that hat off and fucking wicked long, beautiful hair just flows down.
[120:03.65]Come on, man, out with it.
[120:04.75]We haven't got all day to waste.
[120:06.29]Just over there beyond the crib.
[120:08.13]Alright, show us the way.
[120:11.74]Look, here it is, Lieutenant.
[120:18.61]It's been broken into, alright.
[120:21.15]Strange.
[120:22.24]If someone had broken in, the dirt should be piled up here somewhere.
[120:25.26]How long do we have the lease on this warehouse for the graveyard?
[120:27.48]Might as well use the fuck out of it for every single scene in the movie.
[120:31.26]Do we have the right to look down there, Lieutenant?
[120:34.20]Technically, no.
[120:35.28]No?
[120:36.40]This spot looks familiar, though.
[120:39.70]We shouldn't investigate any further without the permission of the next of kin.
[120:42.69]Let's go get it.
[120:43.81]How?
[120:44.45]I see what you mean.
[120:45.11]The gravestone's down there.
[120:48.14]Well, let's go down and find out whose grave it is.
[120:50.32]Billy, I'm doing that stance.
[120:51.38]Quit doing that stance.
[120:52.30]You're copying me.
[120:54.46]Are you sure you mean that, Lieutenant?
[120:56.26]If I didn't mean it, I wouldn't have said it.
[120:58.52]Scared?
[121:00.04]Well, why do I always get hooked up with these spook details?
[121:03.20]Monsters, graves, bodies.
[121:06.13]Alright.
[121:07.25]It's the Ritz Brothers with an added brother.
[121:16.63]Casket's here, but...
[121:18.47]Nobody's in it.
[121:20.29]Can you read the name on the casket?
[121:24.11]It's too dark.
[121:25.79]Give me a flashlight.
[121:27.47]How about a match?
[121:28.71]How about a cigarette?
[121:30.61]Let me have them.
[121:32.11]Okay.
[121:36.36]Here, have a cigarette.
[121:37.30]These were like eating apples in the 40s.
[121:38.90]It's Inspector Clay's grave.
[121:43.32]But he ain't in it.
[121:51.45]but meanwhile at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.
[121:54.25]These guys are still flying this plane.
[121:57.25]Are they ever going to land?
[122:01.29]Ride G2.
[122:01.81]Come in.
[122:07.68]Yes, of course.
[122:08.82]I'll keep in touch.
[122:13.40]Come in, Colonel Edwards.
[122:14.30]Close the door.
[122:18.62]Did somebody say this is the one star general?
[122:21.58]Why is that so?
[122:22.52]Why is that?
[122:22.95]I don't know why that's funny.
[122:25.73]Why is that funny?
[122:26.39]I don't... Oh, the mic.
[122:27.05]Where is the mic?
[122:47.96]There's a mic in the frame?
[122:49.88]I didn't even see it.
[122:57.82]Ride G2.
[122:59.24]Where?
[122:59.54]Come in.
[123:04.19]Yes, of course.
[123:05.47]Keep in touch.
[123:11.59]come in colonel edwards close the door at ease colonel thank you sir sit down I'm just waiting for like a guy in glasses with like a notepad to walk in and just be like oops and see the camera and walk back like a script supervisor colonel you've been on tap for many of our saucer attacks I'm in charge of field operation sir
[123:33.35]You believe there are such things as flying saucers, Colonel?
[123:37.65]Yes, sir.
[123:38.31]Uncropped.
[123:39.57]Yes, sir.
[123:41.33]You realize there's a government directive stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer?
[123:47.31]Yes, sir.
[123:48.77]You stand by your statement that you've seen flying saucers?
[123:52.45]Well, uh... Yes, sir.
[123:57.57]Hmm.
[123:58.43]This could mean a court-martial admitting this against direct orders.
[124:03.60]General Roberts, may I speak freely?
[124:06.34]You may.
[124:06.96]No.
[124:07.42]How could I hope to hold down my command if I didn't believe in what I saw?
[124:11.86]He said no.
[124:12.48]Why are you talking?
[124:16.07]I like you, Colonel.
[124:19.03]Would you like an apple?
[124:20.69]There are flying saucers.
[124:25.81]There's no doubt they are in our skies.
[124:27.76]They've been there for some time.
[124:31.08]What are we going to do about them?
[124:33.10]Who knows?
[124:34.00]Then they really are there.
[124:36.12]Why are there two phones?
[124:37.14]I thought you were convinced of that.
[124:39.49]I am.
[124:40.71]We've had contact.
[124:41.61]Why are there two phones?
[124:42.93]Contact?
[124:43.77]How?
[124:44.35]Radio.
[124:45.81]They speak our language?
[124:47.47]One's a cell phone.
[124:48.89]We've received messages from their spaceships.
[124:51.53]For a while, it came in as just a lot of jumbled noise.
[124:55.30]I don't want my wife to know who I'm calling on my second line.
[124:57.74]Since they first tried contact with us by radio, we've developed a language computer.
[125:03.12]A machine that breaks down any language.
[125:05.50]See, I sell drugs, too.
[125:06.80]You ever see that movie?
[125:08.39]That TV show with Bryan Cranston?
[125:11.31]Well, you've been in charge of saucer field activity for a long while.
[125:15.41]I think it's about time you heard these recordings.
[125:18.49]You mind?
[125:19.51]Mind?
[125:20.89]I'm anxious.
[125:27.64]He's a two-star general, so he has two phones.
[125:29.56]God damn it.
[125:29.86]Since the beginning of your time, we have been far beyond your planet.
[125:53.43]It has taken you centuries to even grasp what we developed eons of your years ago.
[125:58.31]Weird flex, dude.
[125:59.99]Do you still believe it impossible we exist?
[126:03.18]You didn't actually think you were the only inhabited planet in the universe.
[126:07.82]How can any race be so stupid?
[126:10.58]Permit me to set your mind at ease.
[126:12.98]How can anybody be so stupid?
[126:15.68]Only save it.
[126:18.19]We could have destroyed it long ago if that had been our aim.
[126:22.48]Our principal purpose is friendly.
[126:24.90]I admit we have had to take certain means which you might refer to as criminal.
[126:30.16]But that is because of your big guns which have destroyed some of our representatives.
[126:35.55]If you persist in denying us our land, then we must only accept that you do not want us on friendly terms.
[126:44.05]We then have no alternative but to destroy you before you destroy us.
[126:49.78]This really is... This really is L.A.
[126:51.28]Noire.
[127:10.19]That's the end of that one.
[127:11.79]Atmospheric conditions in outer space often interfere with transmitting.
[127:15.87]How many of these recordings do you have, General?
[127:18.23]An even dozen up to now.
[127:19.63]This was the last one.
[127:20.83]We received it over a month ago.
[127:22.52]You think they mean business?
[127:23.90]We can't afford to take any chances.
[127:26.24]Come over here.
[127:26.98]Thank you, language computer.
[127:30.60]You ever been to Hollywood?
[127:32.10]Oh, a couple of times a few years ago.
[127:34.10]You're going to be there in the morning.
[127:36.54]Just a few minutes from Hollywood in the town of San Fernando...
[127:40.80]Reports have come in of saucers flying so low the exhaust knocked people to the ground.
[127:47.17]There have even been stated claims of saucer landings.
[127:50.03]What is that on the left?
[127:51.59]Is that an x-ray of his abdomen?
[127:53.37]By the way, what do you think about these?
[127:55.55]I'm the best man for the job of attempting to contact them.
[127:58.80]Find them, Colonel.
[128:00.18]See what in hell it is they want.
[128:02.56]Alright, sir.
[128:03.48]Don't be concerned.
[128:09.50]These are confidential reports, Colonel.
[128:11.58]Read them over carefully on the plane.
[128:13.78]Turn them over to intelligence when you get to Los Angeles.
[128:16.36]They'll have further orders for disposition.
[128:18.74]Yes, sir.
[128:20.60]Here's my laptop.
[128:21.72]Colonel Edwards?
[128:23.80]Yes, sir.
[128:24.96]Good luck.
[128:25.92]Thank you, sir.
[128:31.25]Here's my luck.
[128:32.01]God damn it.
[128:43.73]Aliens stand up straight, and they do weird things.
[128:46.83]We stand up straight.
[128:48.52]That's how you know we're fucking aliens, because we have good posture.
[128:56.06]We are ready to report, Excellency.
[128:57.98]You are many days late.
[128:59.54]It was unavoidable.
[129:02.05]We tried to transmit via televisor, but atmospheric conditions made transmission impossible.
[129:06.75]You should have transmitted as soon as conditions permitted.
[129:09.84]I thought time was of the essence.
[129:11.74]Suspicion has fallen upon our movements.
[129:13.98]Our ships have been viewed near the point of operations.
[129:17.18]And what has this added time gained, Eros?
[129:19.34]We have successfully risen three of the dead ones.
[129:22.78]Why is that his family crest?
[129:23.88]They have axes in space?
[129:26.08]Bring in the big one.
[129:27.62]Use your small Electrode gun.
[129:34.01]I have taken two ships from your command.
[129:36.87]But that will leave only my ship.
[129:39.76]It is necessary that you continue your mission alone.
[129:43.84]I have need of your other ships elsewhere.
[129:47.66]Even though you have risen three of the Earth's dead, the plan is far from successful, and you, Eros, must prove it an operational success before more time, energy, ships, and your countrymen may be spent on it.
[130:04.06]No, no aliens have died.
[130:05.92]Everything is on our side.
[130:07.80]Not everything.
[130:09.50]You do not have the live Earth people.
[130:14.84]Line.
[130:16.64]You reported that your ship was viewed at the scene of your present operations.
[130:21.29]That is correct.
[130:23.29]They have been viewed many times, but not at the scene of operations.
[130:27.61]Something must be done about that.
[130:30.95]I want this guy to talk.
[130:36.64]Stop him, Tanner.
[130:37.84]He's close enough.
[130:38.88]Turn off your Electrode gun.
[130:40.86]No.
[130:43.22]It's jammed.
[130:44.46]Stop him, Tanner.
[130:45.28]I can't get it.
[130:46.14]It's jammed.
[130:46.82]Stop him, you fool.
[130:48.20]Drop the gun to the floor, Tanner.
[130:49.94]The metal will break contact.
[130:51.26]What?
[130:56.33]That's a Nintendo light gun?
[130:59.05]That was too close.
[131:01.47]Yes.
[131:06.98]Bring the giant here that I may get a better look at him.
[131:17.96]What is he doing to him?
[131:19.76]He's giving him acupuncture.
[131:21.22]I don't understand what this is supposed to do.
[131:23.24]Yes, he's a fine specimen.
[131:25.80]Are they all this powerful on planet Earth?
[131:28.30]This one is an exception, Excellency.
[131:30.94]What are the other two like?
[131:32.42]One is a woman, the other an old man.
[131:35.82]Oh, so big guy.
[131:37.18]Yes, Excellency.
[131:42.66]This gives me a plan.
[131:44.28]Put the big one away.
[131:46.60]Pick up your Electrode gun.
[131:48.25]Make sure it's in working order before pointing it at him.
[131:51.99]And make sure the two tracking devices can see you in VR.
[131:55.97]Goddammit, how do you not know this by now, Mary?
[132:07.97]The old one must be sacrificed.
[132:10.61]Reland on Earth.
[132:13.13]Send the old one... Do what we do.
[132:15.95]Tape two to your legs.
[132:17.10]Then cut the electrokinetic and turn on your ship's decomposure ray.
[132:21.64]The result will astound those watching.
[132:24.70]Astound them enough to delay their intention until you have gained your other recruits from the cemetery.
[132:32.08]Yes, Excellency.
[132:33.36]It'll be done.
[132:35.32]Report to me when this has been accomplished.
[132:45.43]Heroes, the Earth people are getting closer to that which we fear.
[132:49.69]Since they will not listen or respect our existence, they cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking around again, brought about by our advancement in such things.
[133:00.88]As soon as you have enough of the dead recruits, march them on the capitals of the Earth.
[133:05.06]Let nothing stand in your way.
[133:07.08]For a second I thought they were blurring his crest out.
[133:10.33]Like they didn't want to get sued by McDonald's or something.
[133:19.93]He's just reading.
[133:48.76]Cemetery again.
[133:49.42]I have four sets in this whole movie.
[133:55.42]Cemetery, backyard, spaceship.
[133:57.66]God damn it.
[133:58.38]That's uncomfortable for me to do that.
[134:19.66]After that, the police brought me home.
[134:22.66]I hope I never see such a sight again.
[134:24.64]Well, after your description, I don't think I'd want to see it either.
[134:28.94]One thing more.
[134:30.52]After you were forced to the ground by that blast of wind, was it a hot or cold blast?
[134:34.64]Coca-Cola.
[134:35.14]Coke.
[134:35.50]Coca-Cola.
[134:37.21]It's kind of hard to explain.
[134:38.51]It wasn't hot.
[134:39.05]It wasn't cold.
[134:40.39]It was just a terrific force.
[134:43.21]We couldn't get off the ground.
[134:45.05]The light blinded me so badly, I couldn't see a thing.
[134:49.01]We could only feel the pressure of the wind until it was gone.
[134:53.29]When the glare left us, we could see a glowing ball disappearing off in the distance.
[134:57.93]Which way?
[134:58.83]Toward the cemetery.
[135:00.77]Oh, here they come.
[135:04.19]Have we seen this guy's face one time?
[135:05.86]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[135:11.32]Right, right, right.
[135:12.02]Yeah, here we have.
[135:16.40]This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard.
[135:20.00]And every word of it's true, too.
[135:21.84]That's the fantastic part of it.
[135:24.16]Colonel, we found a lot of suspicious things out in that cemetery.
[135:28.69]Then again... They got mileage out of that one.
[135:34.09]Hey, do you hear anything?
[135:44.04]You see anything out there, Kelton?
[135:46.50]Too dark, Lieutenant.
[135:50.20]But something started stinking awful bad.
[135:54.83]Lieutenant, turn the car off.
[135:58.19]There's something out there.
[136:17.21]Does he get zapped?
[136:18.77]Please zap him.
[136:19.55]Please.
[136:28.82]Why do they always wait this long?
[136:34.70]Get in the car and close the door.
[136:35.98]Roll the windows up.
[136:36.68]He can't get in.
[136:38.32]This guy has no fucking powers.
[136:41.36]He's just a little odd.
[137:01.48]Why are you standing still?
[137:08.83]Run?
[137:09.79]Maybe run the fuck away?
[137:28.91]This guy has the same emotion the whole scene.
[137:31.99]How do you know?
[137:53.16]Did you see that thing?
[137:54.38]Did you get it?
[137:55.16]We got it.
[137:56.06]What was it?
[137:57.36]It didn't fall.
[137:58.18]I fired every bullet I had.
[138:00.18]So did I. No, you got him.
[138:01.50]You got him.
[138:01.90]I don't know what it was or what happened, but unless that bag of bones over there can reassemble itself, it's out of the running now.
[138:10.11]Five-year-old.
[138:20.05]Colonel?
[138:20.86]I've been out here so often, you'd think I'd taken a lease on this.
[138:23.30]Back to the cemetery, yeah.
[138:24.26]Not a long lease, I hope.
[138:25.62]I see what you mean.
[138:26.54]But you know, I can't help but feel the answer's out here somewhere.
[138:30.90]Is the girl safe?
[138:32.40]I thought he was going to go to smoke his cigarette.
[138:34.14]Mr. Trent, you'd better stay with the car.
[138:35.35]He looked like he was like, oh, let me take a drag.
[138:37.19]It's my turn.
[138:39.59]Modern women.
[138:41.09]Yeah, they've been that way all down through the ages.
[138:43.55]Especially in a spot like this.
[138:45.87]Yes, sir.
[138:46.23]Stay with Mrs. Trent.
[138:47.59]Alright, Lieutenant.
[138:49.16]Now, you stay close to the officer, honey.
[138:50.93]I'd feel safer with you.
[138:52.17]Oh, yeah, there's still two enemies remaining.
[138:57.29]Now, the lieutenant knows best.
[138:58.75]Well, I don't like it, but I guess there isn't much I can do about it.
[139:09.50]You have a gun?
[139:10.00]No.
[139:11.32]You know how to use one?
[139:14.60]After four years in the Marine Corps?
[139:17.15]Here.
[139:17.37]Here.
[139:19.50]Do you think we'll need this?
[139:20.88]Never tell.
[139:22.06]Let's get going.
[139:22.62]Did he just give him his gun?
[139:25.36]Here, I want you to be responsible for shooting the lady, not me.
[139:29.84]I was here, but I didn't do it.
[139:32.23]What?
[139:35.87]You take it.
[139:36.45]You fire.
[139:36.91]What do you expect to find out here?
[139:44.35]Well, there's only one answer to that, Mr. Trent.
[139:46.51]We'll know when we find it.
[139:49.49]Yeah, guns don't do anything.
[139:52.50]Why are they still firing?
[140:03.98]Just pick up a fucking tombstone and hit her in the face.
[140:12.22]This it?
[140:12.74]Yeah.
[140:14.05]Looks to me like someone has broken out instead of in.
[140:16.69]I'm surviving during a zombie apocalypse, guys.
[140:18.45]That's impossible.
[140:20.57]Look, Colonel, some things just can't happen.
[140:23.79]Yeah, well, after that apparition that was draped across Mr. Transpatio, I would say we should keep our minds open to anything.
[140:31.16]Look, Colonel, I'm a policeman.
[140:33.26]I've got the deal and facts.
[140:35.42]But I guess I'll have to go along with you.
[140:39.38]You know, I'll bet my badge right now we haven't seen the last of those weirdies.
[140:48.44]They'll discover our ship soon.
[140:51.00]You're going to let them find us?
[140:52.27]It's the only way.
[140:53.61]These are the same men who have been so close so often.
[140:56.53]They must be halted before they can inform others about us.
[140:59.41]But there were others in the car.
[141:00.29]This is a painted garage.
[141:00.97]That's a garage.
[141:01.47]Yep, that's the door going into your house from your garage.
[141:18.10]Look at the floor.
[141:24.26]The whole movie is a garage.
[141:26.12]Oh shit, you're right.
[141:36.23]No, it's a real spaceship.
[141:41.97]You know, maybe we barking up the wrong tree.
[141:44.84]One thing a policeman learns, Mr. Trent, is patience.
[141:47.68]Where's that burn spot you mentioned?
[141:49.78]Right over there.
[141:50.32]I'm going to piss my pants.
[141:54.46]Oh, we got a long way to go.
[142:02.42]We'll investigate, but move carefully.
[142:09.23]Alright.
[142:10.67]I'm going to pee.
[142:11.37]I'm going to piss my pants.
[142:15.15]I'll be right back.
[142:16.33]Interlude.
[142:17.17]We got 20 minutes left of the movie.
[142:18.90]Interlude.
[147:57.08]Go to the lobby?
[147:57.76]Well, get back in here.
[148:00.70]Hurry up.
[148:01.18]Get in here.
[148:04.62]The projectionist... The project... The projectionist.
[148:09.16]It's a hard word to say.
[148:13.58]Back to the movie.
[148:16.22]I scared you?
[148:16.74]I'm sorry.
[148:19.14]That's a hard... No, no, no.
[148:20.26]That has nothing to do with the amount of drinks I've had.
[148:22.64]That's a hard word to say.
[148:25.12]Projectionist.
[148:27.88]Projectionist.
[148:29.58]It's difficult.
[148:30.14]No, no, I've had two drinks.
[148:31.52]Relax.
[148:35.94]Here we go.
[148:46.69]I got behind you.
[148:49.47]Turn around.
[148:50.79]Why is she sleeping in the car?
[148:56.89]Ah!
[149:03.17]he just did the equivalent of wiping his cheeto hands on his sleeves that doesn't do very much damage a moment or two more
[149:21.64]And you will be the first live Earth people ever to enter a celestial ship.
[149:27.72]That's a fucking hand dryer from the bathroom.
[149:34.61]Never heard metal sound like that before.
[149:37.27]What do you see?
[149:38.48]Only my reflection.
[149:39.76]Must be some kind of one way glass.
[149:41.98]I wonder how you get into this thing.
[149:44.30]I'm not sure I want to find out.
[149:51.24]Humans have made it on board the garage.
[149:56.46]They've stepped over the water heater and avoided the cardboard boxes from the move we did three years ago.
[150:05.82]You can open the outer hatch now.
[150:15.85]They've just crossed the power washer we've never used, that we bought truly, truly saying we were going to use it.
[150:21.30]Oh, don't worry, because they're humans.
[150:45.98]You'll be shooting other humans.
[150:47.42]Can you sleep at night after that one, Jack?
[150:52.80]They're in the outer chamber now.
[150:57.73]Eros, do we have to kill them?
[151:03.13]Yes.
[151:05.39]Seems such a waste.
[151:07.79]Well, wouldn't it be better to kill a few now than, with their meddling, permit them to destroy the entire universe?
[151:15.11]You're always right, Eros.
[151:16.25]Of course.
[151:17.91]But those are not my words.
[151:19.74]Those are the words of the rumor.
[151:22.38]And who is that?
[151:23.00]You two stay right where you're at.
[151:31.02]You're not so different, you and I. Really, the only difference is you got your outfit from Party City.
[151:37.73]And I wear a suit to work.
[151:39.81]Who's the real weirdo?
[151:41.49]You just do as I tell you.
[151:50.54]You do not need guns.
[151:51.98]Maybe we think we do.
[151:54.45]They would be of no use to you now.
[151:56.59]They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood.
[151:59.73]And you two look like you've got a lot of both.
[152:05.01]True.
[152:05.93]They would be effective upon us.
[152:07.19]True.
[152:08.11]If you were to have the opportunity to use them.
[152:10.46]Lester, if you don't get away from that control board, I'll show you just how effective they can be.
[152:19.39]Shall we talk now or wait?
[152:21.69]Your friends will be here shortly.
[152:23.05]That's awesome.
[152:25.21]Those you left at the vehicle.
[152:28.01]If you've done anything to Paula... Take it easy, Mr. Trent.
[152:30.71]I assure you no harm has come to her.
[152:33.18]Would you like to see?
[152:37.36]Next time you try that, I won't aim at the board.
[152:39.76]You're a headstrong young man.
[152:41.16]That was a cure for every illness in America.
[152:44.26]What are you, stupid?
[152:48.74]Go ahead, my friend, but move very carefully.
[152:57.56]Only in America, apparently.
[153:07.13]She's only fainted.
[153:09.79]You fiend.
[153:12.25]I?
[153:12.35]A fiend?
[153:13.99]Um...
[153:15.76]Hold on a second.
[153:17.38]What's going on with his grip on this gun?
[153:19.76]This grip on this gun is like trying to get into the claw of a lobster at Red Lobster.
[153:25.85]Like, dude, what is this grip?
[153:38.75]She's only fainted.
[153:42.00]His hand's going... Why?
[153:45.16]A fiend?
[153:45.68]I feel like his hands were made in dreams.
[153:48.22]I am a soldier of our planet.
[153:51.00]I?
[153:51.16]A fiend?
[153:55.28]We did not come here as enemies.
[153:57.48]We came only with friendly intentions.
[153:59.60]To talk.
[154:00.90]To ask your aid.
[154:03.14]Our aid?
[154:04.42]Yes.
[154:05.76]Your aid for the whole universe.
[154:08.97]But your governments of Earth refused even to accept our existence.
[154:13.05]Even though you've seen us.
[154:14.63]Heard our messages.
[154:16.19]You still refuse to accept us.
[154:19.25]Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our Earth?
[154:22.77]Because of death.
[154:25.36]Because all you of Earth are idiots.
[154:28.76]You just hold on, Buster.
[154:30.20]No, you hold on.
[154:31.94]First was your firecracker.
[154:33.92]A harmless explosive.
[154:35.88]Then your hand grenade.
[154:37.69]They began to kill your own people a few at a time.
[154:41.51]Then the bomb.
[154:43.31]Then a larger bomb.
[154:44.93]Many people are killed at one time.
[154:48.82]Then your scientists stumbled upon the atom bomb.
[154:51.90]Split the atom.
[154:52.96]A larger bomb.
[154:54.08]Then the hydrogen bomb, where you actually explode the air itself.
[155:00.24]Now it brings the total destruction of the entire universe served by our sun.
[155:06.85]The only explosion left is the solar night.
[155:11.39]Why, there's no such thing.
[155:13.11]Perhaps to you.
[155:14.67]But we've known it for centuries.
[155:17.29]Your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others.
[155:21.21]But the juvenile minds which you possess will not comprehend its strength until it's too late.
[155:28.54]You're way above our heads.
[155:30.90]The solar monite is a way to explode the actual particles of sunlight.
[155:35.46]Why, that's impossible.
[155:37.52]Even now, your scientists are working on a way to harness the sun's rays.
[155:42.33]The rays of sunlight are minute particles.
[155:45.21]Is it so far from your imagination, they cannot do as I have suggested, why a particle of sunlight can't even be seen or measured?
[155:52.14]Can you see or measure an atom?
[155:53.78]Yes.
[155:54.84]Yet you can explode one.
[155:55.98]A ray of sunlight is made up of many atoms.
[155:59.86]So what if we do develop this solenoid bomb?
[156:02.01]We'd be even a stronger nation than now.
[156:04.21]Stronger.
[156:05.53]You see?
[156:06.37]You see?
[156:07.21]Your stupid minds!
[156:08.81]Stupid!
[156:09.59]Stupid!
[156:10.45]That's all I'm taking from you.
[156:11.75]Get back here, you jerk!
[156:12.95]He turned green!
[156:14.81]Let him finish.
[156:15.81]He turned green.
[156:16.41]He's an alien.
[156:16.87]He was just projecting different skin.
[156:23.34]It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed.
[156:26.88]Headstrong.
[156:28.10]Violent.
[156:29.48]No use of the mind God gave you.
[156:32.64]You talk of God?
[156:33.64]It's red blood.
[156:35.26]You also think it impossible that we, too, might think of God?
[156:41.16]You guys celebrate Easter?
[156:42.26]You.
[156:43.34]I do?
[156:43.72]Wear the uniform of your country.
[156:45.38]You see, I wear the uniform of my country.
[156:50.35]Yes, we've had to use drastic means... Eggs and the bunny and shit?
[156:54.21]But you left us no alternative.
[156:57.15]When you have the soul of a knight, you have nothing.
[157:01.55]Nor does the universe.
[157:05.17]You speak of solar and night, but just what is it?
[157:09.59]Take a can of your gasoline.
[157:12.34]Say, this can of gasoline is the sun.
[157:16.94]Now, you spread a thin line of it to a ball, representing the Earth.
[157:23.39]Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight, the sun particles.
[157:28.97]Here we saturate the ball with the gasoline, the sunlight.
[157:33.82]Then we put a flame to the ball.
[157:36.26]The flame will speedily travel around the Earth, back along the line of gasoline to the can or the sun itself.
[157:43.11]Just like that GTA 5 mission.
[157:44.19]It will explode this source.
[157:45.47]You play that Trevor mission.
[157:46.47]And spread to every place that gasoline, our sunlight touches.
[157:52.90]Explode the sunlight here, gentlemen.
[157:55.30]You explode the universe.
[157:58.33]Explode the sunlight here and a chain reaction will occur Direct to the Sun itself true and to all the planets that sunlight touches to every planet in the universe This is why you must be stopped this is why any means must be used to stop you in a friendly manner Or as it seems
[158:24.37]This is a Vsauce video.
[158:27.09]Mad?
[158:28.03]Is it mad that you destroy other people to save yourselves?
[158:31.37]You have done this.
[158:33.07]Is it mad that one country must destroy another to save themselves?
[158:37.01]You have also done this.
[158:39.11]How then is it mad that one planet must destroy another who threatens the very existence?
[158:43.84]That's enough!
[158:44.82]She was just saying the same shit that you were.
[158:46.70]What?
[158:47.74]In my land, women are for advancing the race, not for fighting man's battles.
[158:53.46]Well, in our land, gas is worthless right now, so your analogy doesn't make any fucking sense.
[158:57.84]Crude is worth like negative $30, bro.
[158:59.72]Our entire aim is for the development of our planet.
[159:15.17]Back to the graveyard.
[159:17.35]We always end up here.
[159:22.20]What happened to you?
[159:23.18]How come you're all alone?
[159:24.56]I asked for lots of help.
[159:25.74]You sounded drunk or something on the radio.
[159:28.22]If I didn't see with my own eyes, I'd never believe it.
[159:30.42]Believe what?
[159:32.04]It was horrible.
[159:33.28]And he almost broke my shoulder.
[159:34.96]Look, what are you trying to say?
[159:36.42]If you don't make sense, we'll never get to the bottom of this.
[159:38.71]Now, who slugged you?
[159:40.61]Inspector Clay.
[159:42.51]What?
[159:43.25]It was Clay, alright.
[159:44.91]Only not like we remembered him.
[159:47.71]Well, his clay was busted into, wasn't it?
[159:49.53]I can't even take this anymore.
[159:50.37]Next you'll tell me you saw skeletons.
[159:52.75]We did earlier.
[159:54.69]Now I know you're off your rocker.
[159:57.19]All of us saw it.
[159:57.99]The lieutenant, the colonel, everybody.
[160:00.03]Where's the lieutenant now?
[160:01.69]We've got to find him.
[160:02.91]Mrs. Trenner's gone.
[160:04.23]I was left here to guard her.
[160:05.86]But Clay showed up and put me out of the running.
[160:08.70]And the second time tonight, and I'm getting darn tired of it.
[160:11.48]Which way were they going?
[160:13.06]Off that way.
[160:14.00]Come on.
[160:14.52]I don't know.
[160:14.84]I'm a police officer in every movie.
[160:16.54]I don't know anything.
[160:22.35]And then one day it could all be gone.
[160:25.47]One big puff of smoke and ball of fire.
[160:30.39]All that out there, the stars, the planets, all just an empty void.
[160:38.78]You two had better come along with us.
[160:40.44]Come with you?
[160:42.00]We're going to arrest the aliens?
[160:43.34]The police station.
[160:47.95]So it seems you think you have the upper hand.
[160:52.23]Look out that window.
[160:59.41]Jeb.
[161:03.68]Jeb?
[161:05.28]Hey Jeb, come over here Jeb.
[161:10.46]She is unarmed, but he would kill in seconds if I so choose.
[161:22.09]like we've crossed this path before yes we have holy cow it's the only path in the movie same oh my god I can't I can't even watch this anymore look there it's clay alright there's no mistaking that and he's got Mrs. trent get your gun ready from all I've seen tonight guns won't do any good
[161:47.70]Clay is dead, and we buried him.
[161:50.08]How are we going to kill somebody that's already dead?
[161:52.02]Jimmy Fallon?
[161:52.64]Dead, and yet there he stands.
[161:54.59]Well, no, that doesn't make any sense.
[161:55.87]He hasn't laughed yet and ruined every skit he's been in.
[161:59.03]That's the only reason I'm listening to you.
[162:04.95]Look, I've got an idea.
[162:06.53]Heard him or not, we've got to try something.
[162:09.27]I'm going to sneak up behind him and whop him over the head.
[162:11.91]That ought to make a move.
[162:14.12]Follow me.
[162:15.32]Even when Clay was alive, he couldn't run fast enough.
[162:17.10]He's over there somewhere.
[162:19.94]Run like lightning in the opposite direction.
[162:22.68]You think it'll work?
[162:24.18]Know of anything else to try?
[162:25.28]Oh my God, this is going to be so funny.
[162:31.00]He's going to hit him in the fucking head.
[162:42.94]Oh, I'll be alright.
[162:46.48]Why just gently tapping somebody's... What?
[162:49.46]Hold on.
[162:49.78]Was he dubbing her voice?
[162:50.66]He was just dubbing her voice.
[162:52.90]It took him an hour and 13 minutes to hit somebody with a stick.
[162:57.10]You think it'll work?
[163:33.93]Oh, I'll be alright.
[163:38.16]Take care of the others.
[163:40.10]That's him doing her voice.
[163:41.90]He's practicing.
[163:43.94]This could only happen because the Electrode ray is off.
[163:47.32]He'll walk again when I turn it on.
[163:49.06]All that?
[163:50.40]Right there.
[163:52.06]Suppose the lieutenant and the others are in that thing.
[163:53.95]Well, supposing there are margins or something in there.
[164:05.62]You're under arrest, we're gonna put you... Not really punching... Oh, here's the gun!
[164:15.93]The gun's a prop!
[164:28.84]Somebody swing something.
[164:29.88]Hold on to him, Eros.
[164:33.02]I'll have the ship in the air in a minute.
[164:41.04]What is he doing over there?
[164:46.28]He doesn't know what that is.
[164:49.69]Jack, stop doing that.
[164:51.11]You're dropping air pressure in the room.
[164:59.70]Get out of here, Jeff.
[165:00.85]The ship's on fire.
[165:06.45]Get out of here, Jeff.
[165:11.34]The ship's on fire.
[165:21.23]It's just not even connected.
[165:25.13]By the way, this is like, we're talking about garages.
[165:28.51]That's the electrical meter.
[165:32.21]They just dolled it up a little bit.
[165:33.59]That's the thing the guy comes to your house to see how much electricity you've used.
[165:42.16]They added a couple of dials to it.
[165:47.13]Get out of here, man.
[165:47.91]The ship's on fire.
[165:49.05]Get out of the garage.
[165:50.83]The garage is on fire.
[165:52.55]Yeah, for some reason, we decided to turn our grow on in the garage.
[166:00.89]We're fucking idiots.
[166:02.13]You're supposed to use these things outside, man.
[166:07.31]Fausta Italiano.
[166:16.60]You're supposed to use charcoal inside.
[166:29.77]Was it worth it?
[166:30.89]Was it worth it?
[166:31.67]I don't give a shit about your Beyond Burgers, Mike.
[166:34.29]They're gross.
[166:36.87]God damn it, you should have been safe.
[166:38.65]Oh, he's dead.
[166:41.44]Have they caught that woman?
[166:43.22]That thing yet?
[166:45.15]That's right.
[166:46.09]There's another ghoul running loose.
[166:47.73]And it's my guess that she'll look like him.
[166:50.09]With the ship and the ray gun gone, they have no control.
[166:55.08]We gotta hand it to them, though.
[166:56.32]They're far ahead of us.
[166:58.56]Open the window!
[167:11.33]Let's just open up.
[167:14.35]My friend, you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony.
[167:18.82]Can you prove that it didn't happen?
[167:22.60]Perhaps on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark, and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space.
[167:32.46]Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment.
[167:37.13]We once laughed at the horseless carriage, the airplane,
[167:41.37]the telephone, the electric light, vitamins, radio, and even television.
[167:47.39]And now some of us laugh at outer space.
[167:55.52]God help us in the future.
[168:11.84]Filmed in a garage in Hollywood, USA.
[168:19.14]That was... That was fucking ridiculous.
[168:22.33]What a stupid movie.
[168:34.33]God.
[168:34.69]Oh, those were two... Back to back, those were... Those were great.
[168:41.67]Very much worth watching on stream.
[168:44.91]I wonder if the next one will hold up.
[168:47.94]The next one could be not even close.
[168:51.64]I don't know.
[168:52.74]It's worth a shot, though.
[168:55.30]Coming up next, we have to close this out.
[169:00.91]This is the longest one.
[169:04.27]This is Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.
[169:08.93]This is the longest one, so this is an hour and 20 minutes.
[169:14.82]I don't uh another alien themed one This is gonna be so fucking bad this one sucks dude Well we're gonna watch it It's very boring oh
[169:44.76]How could you have a boring movie if you're Santa Claus conquering Martians?
[169:53.60]Let's see what happens.
[169:54.42]I'm will- I'm willing to give it a try.
[169:59.79]It's not what you think.
[170:01.33]It's terrible.
[170:03.19]It's terrible.
[170:04.33]I- Vito?
[170:11.16]Vito!
[170:11.68]I'm- Vito?!
[170:13.20]What?! !
[170:18.05]The fuck?
[170:22.20]Holy shit.
[170:26.44]This is unbelievable.
[170:27.98]This is like the most I've ever seen chat agree.
[170:34.36]Oh my god.
[170:37.85]Okay.
[170:39.65]So this... This is bad?
[170:41.99]Are you sure?
[170:44.92]Are you sure?
[170:47.50]Come along, Mr. Anderson, and I'll show you some of the new toys we're turning out.
[170:52.38]Are you sure?
[170:53.04]Okay, well.
[171:06.91]Are you guys sure?
[171:08.45]Are you sure about this?
[171:12.90]Give it a chance.
[171:14.28]Give us a chance.
[171:18.40]Watch the first... Alright.
[171:19.60]We're going to watch the first 10 minutes.
[171:22.46]If this don't work out, then we're going to move on to another one.
[171:27.51]And the other one is Attack of the Giant Leeches.
[171:32.75]Attack of the Giant Leeches is the one that's up next.
[171:39.38]That sounds better.
[171:49.40]But what about the Santa Claus one?
[171:51.30]Ah, leeches, please.
[171:56.25]Oh, right.
[171:58.09]Fine.
[171:59.79]We're going to watch 10 minutes of Santa first.
[172:01.41]We're going to watch Santa Claus conquers Earth with bombs or whatever he does.
[172:05.47]I don't know.
[172:05.81]Santa conquers Earth.
[172:07.19]No, Santa conquers the Martians.
[172:09.23]We're going for it.
[172:09.75]We're going to watch 10 minutes of this.
[172:13.48]If in times two speed, fine.
[172:19.90]If in five to ten minutes, this is not, I don't like this, we're gonna move on.
[172:31.97]I want it at regular speed.
[172:40.67]Nah, this is a fucking song in the beginning?
[172:43.84]Don't think so.
[173:07.28]Give us 20 minutes.
[173:08.45]20 minutes.
[173:10.93]That's what I want.
[173:12.59]In 20 minutes, if this is not worth watching, we're going to watch Attack of the fucking Giant Slugs.
[173:18.83]Okay?
[173:22.27]Look, you just get more content.
[173:24.78]We start a new movie if this isn't very good.
[173:41.00]You'll hear ho, ho, ho.
[173:42.96]Yeah, yeah.
[173:43.68]On Christmas Day, you'll wake up and you'll say, hooray for Santy Claus.
[173:48.96]Santy Claus.
[173:50.00]S-A-N-T-A-C-L-A-U-S.
[173:52.40]Hooray for Santy Claus.
[173:56.53]Here we go.
[173:57.07]S-A-N-T-A-C-L-A-U-S.
[173:59.33]It's time for Santy Claus.
[174:01.85]Hooray for Santy Claus.
[174:11.46]These movies are free, okay?
[174:13.56]Oh, you guys have a lot of credit.
[174:14.33]At this time, station KID TV brings you the special event of the year.
[174:19.41]A first in television history.
[174:21.75]Santa's going to find a bunch of fucking Martians.
[174:23.66]KID TV has standing by a television crew at Santa Claus Workshop.
[174:29.20]And in just a few seconds, our special correspondent, Andy Henderson, will bring you a person-to-person interview with Santa Claus himself, direct from the North Pole.
[174:38.19]Stevenson.
[174:38.79]Stevens.
[174:39.79]Anderson.
[174:40.17]Anderson.
[174:40.63]The temperature is 91 degrees below zero.
[174:44.16]And now KID TV.
[174:46.28]Oh, kids!
[174:48.22]Andy Henderson at the North Pole.
[174:49.76]Wait, these are Martians.
[174:50.62]Hi, kids!
[174:51.54]Nah, if you go north, you end up south.
[174:53.25]Fucking idiot.
[174:53.85]Stupid fucking moron.
[174:55.11]God, it makes me mad.
[174:56.53]Here we go!
[175:22.66]20 minutes.
[175:22.94]Relax.
[175:28.74]Hello again.
[175:31.12]Reporting live from Santa's workshop.
[175:33.15]It's just weeks before Christmas and Santa and his helpers are working overtime to make sure that there's enough toys for the kids all over the world.
[175:42.47]Santa's a pretty busy man, but I'm sure he'd like to say a few words to you kids.
[175:47.21]I'm not vetoing this yet.
[175:48.59]Relax.
[175:49.31]Hello, Santa.
[175:50.78]Oh, hello, Santa.
[175:52.81]Oh, oh, hello, boys and girls.
[175:56.59]Smoking.
[175:57.07]Everybody smokes.
[175:57.67]Even the kids.
[175:58.57]Well, we've never disappointed the kids yet.
[176:00.04]Tell me, is it true that...
[176:10.38]This year, there's a rumor that you're going to use a rocket sled.
[176:14.05]No, sirree.
[176:15.99]We're going out the good old-fashioned way with my reindeer.
[176:19.93]Prancer and Dancer and Dunder and Blitz and... Bunker?
[176:24.39]Bixen and Nixen.
[176:26.72]Donger is not a... Is that a donger?
[176:29.24]Mr. Anderson, this is Mrs. Clark.
[176:30.74]Mr. Anderson.
[176:31.16]Oh, fucking simulation or something.
[176:32.06]Television?
[176:32.48]Did you say we were on television?
[176:56.67]I hate this, but I'm 20 minutes.
[176:58.43]We have 15 more minutes.
[176:59.19]Don't care.
[176:59.69]Come along, Mr. Anderson, and I'll show you some of the new toys we're turning out.
[177:04.17]This is a bazooka.
[177:05.22]This is a knife.
[177:22.97]Everything is a-okay, Santa.
[177:24.95]Good man.
[177:26.34]Winky is in charge of our space department.
[177:29.96]Oh, uh, now here...
[177:32.25]Here is the latest toy rocket.
[177:34.65]It runs on real rocket fuel.
[177:37.15]Really?
[177:38.37]I've been wondering, what is this strange little creature over here?
[177:42.08]Oh, uh, Winky made that.
[177:44.92]That's his idea of a Martian.
[177:47.14]A Martian?
[177:48.02]Is he on fire?
[177:49.10]I'd hate to meet a creature like that on a dark night.
[177:52.61]I wonder if there really are people on Mars.
[177:54.83]Well, who knows?
[177:56.41]Well, if there are, I hope they have someone like you up there, Santa, to bring joy and good cheer to all the Martian children.
[178:02.63]Oh, Mr. Anders.
[178:06.36]Keep going, Winky.
[178:07.60]Christmas Eve is coming soon.
[178:09.42]Now, Mr. Anderson, I want to show you some more things.
[178:15.72]Drapo?
[178:16.60]Drapo, you lazy good-for-nothing, where are you?
[178:19.32]This sucks.
[178:23.36]Drapo.
[178:25.01]And then a garage!
[178:25.83]Dropper, wake up!
[178:26.69]Dropper, wake up!
[178:27.80]We've painted our garage a new color!
[178:34.68]It's a funny ray!
[178:35.74]Please turn off that tickle ray!
[178:39.14]Stand up!
[178:39.74]Oh, I hate this.
[178:41.28]Stand up.
[178:43.28]This is fucking horrible.
[178:45.38]Stand up!
[178:46.84]Stand up!
[178:49.40]I'm sorry, Chief Keemar, sir.
[178:51.14]Dropo, you are the laziest man on Mars.
[178:54.01]Why are you sleeping during working hours?
[178:56.87]I wasn't sleeping, Chief.
[178:58.93]I'm just kidding.
[179:00.69]Good.
[179:01.65]Is the master here?
[179:02.45]Oh, he's in there.
[179:04.01]And Keemar's very angry, too.
[179:06.28]Keemar, I bought some new food pills.
[179:08.10]I hope the children will eat these.
[179:10.18]We have hamburger, buttered asparagus, mashed potatoes, and a special treat.
[179:16.26]Some kind.
[179:20.81]So that's what the Earth people call a city, eh?
[179:24.45]How primitive.
[179:26.27]Look at all those buildings above ground.
[179:29.44]Why we could destroy that city with one blast of our Q-Ray.
[179:39.68]He's wearing like a beer helmet.
[179:41.56]I'm waiting for the straw to go in his mouth and to be like, oh, those primitive humans.
[179:55.62]Skip it!
[179:57.32]Who's driving the plane?
[180:03.24]Is the guy driving the plane facing the other direction?
[180:08.14]Skip it!
[180:25.66]We have our children on Mars.
[180:27.20]Is it gone?
[180:33.57]Very well.
[180:34.61]Come along.
[180:35.53]Where'd these kids come from?
[180:41.14]This morning, two children disappeared mysteriously from the vicinity of Welch Lake.
[180:45.48]The police have found no clues, and it seems as though Billy and Betty Foster have simply vanished into thin air.
[180:51.34]This appears to be a day when everything is vanishing into thin air, while local police are continuing their- No, sir!
[181:01.29]As a matter of fact, I was just looking in there to remind myself never to hide in there again.
[181:06.15]I bet.
[181:13.84]Who the fuck is Santa Claus?
[181:23.58]Santa Claus versus the Martians.
[181:24.70]Where the fuck is Santa?
[181:25.64]I want one scene where Santa... ...where Santa lives.
[181:30.54]Besides, I've always wanted to visit Mars.
[181:35.76]Mommy and Daddy are going to be angry.
[181:38.91]You think that's something?
[181:40.69]I can just see Mrs. Claus now.
[181:43.17]Christmas coming, and I'm not there.
[181:45.45]You have a fit.
[181:49.77]Oh, me, oh, my, oh, me.
[181:53.15]Come and get it.
[181:54.11]Dinner time.
[181:55.31]Here's Droppo.
[181:57.05]If I can't cheer you up, Droppo can.
[181:59.87]He always makes me laugh.
[182:02.07]What does he know?
[182:02.89]Dinner tonight.
[182:04.95]Oh, there's soup and...
[182:07.45]I love Mickey Mouse.
[182:10.63]No, thank you, Charlie.
[182:11.63]I'm not hungry.
[182:13.09]Even when he's almost an alien guy.
[182:17.09]Well, is it alright if I have your chocolate ice cream?
[182:20.38]Sure.
[182:21.28]Oh, I just love chocolate ice cream.
[182:38.76]Rigna, after we secured the ship and lowered the ladder... I can't believe it.
[182:57.67]That's the first time in months they've gone to sleep without the sleep spray.
[183:01.81]Santa, tomorrow we'll set up a workshop for you.
[183:05.42]It won't be exactly the same as the one you have on Earth, but I'm sure it'll serve your purpose.
[183:10.63]Alright, what do you want, Holder?
[183:12.79]These are our terms.
[183:16.11]First, destroy the toy machine.
[183:20.51]Why does he have no beard?
[183:23.70]What?
[183:23.88]What's going on?
[183:24.60]Where's his beard?
[183:50.54]It was good.
[183:52.38]Merry Christmas, everybody.
[183:56.03]You get it.
[183:58.33]Okay.
[183:59.27]Attack of the Giant Leeches.
[184:04.39]Attack of the Giant Leeches incoming here.
[184:06.69]Cool.
[184:09.06]This is going to be probably, this might be worse.
[184:19.21]This one is only one hour long.
[184:27.60]Veto what?
[184:32.84]How am I?
[184:35.22]I veto this one too?
[184:36.74]No, we're watching this one.
[184:49.30]Here we go.
[184:50.68]Three.
[184:51.92]This is Attack of the Giant Leeches.
[184:55.52]Three.
[184:56.80]Two.
[184:58.04]One.
[185:14.37]This is crusty.
[185:16.39]Very crusty.
[185:19.13]It's crusty.
[185:21.39]And a leech?
[185:52.85]Get him.
[186:00.01]That was a leech.
[186:03.47]Or a mountain lion.
[186:04.47]Yeah, either one.
[186:07.44]Lower the saturation.
[186:08.70]Oh, great.
[186:09.84]I'll drink to that one.
[186:13.00]You know when you drink it out of an instrument.
[186:15.30]You're in an old movie.
[186:28.19]Sorry, Ken Clark, Yvette Vickers, Jan Shepard, and Michael Emmett.
[186:33.45]With these people that I don't feel like reading.
[186:38.66]Virtual story screenplay by this guy.
[186:40.50]Who cares?
[186:41.18]This looks like garbage.
[187:03.29]Bring on the fucking Ritz Brothers.
[187:05.63]That's what I gotta say.
[187:08.55]Dick Rubin?
[187:10.17]What?
[187:15.03]Oh, it is Dick Rubin.
[187:16.17]Huh.
[187:16.61]It's Rubin.
[187:20.11]Rubin.
[187:20.51]Relax.
[187:31.14]It's Ruben.
[187:38.22]Bernard.
[187:43.75]Good work, Bernard.
[187:50.78]This is fucking crustier than a goddamn burnt piece of toast.
[187:57.28]Ay-yi-yi.
[188:01.98]Wait a minute.
[188:03.14]Wait a minute.
[188:05.60]Hold on.
[188:06.34]Hold on.
[188:06.78]Hold on.
[188:09.32]Just hold it a second, Lamb.
[188:11.22]Les?
[188:11.96]Hold on.
[188:12.47]Hold on.
[188:12.83]Wait, wait, wait a minute.
[188:14.09]Do you hear me, girl?
[188:16.73]What, are you playing the piano?
[188:18.37]Well, you won't now.
[188:27.62]What is that?
[188:27.96]What are you putting in your mouth?
[188:29.58]Don't put that in your mouth.
[188:31.40]Take that out of your mouth.
[188:34.47]Oh, she's brushing her teeth.
[188:35.43]That's the weirdest.
[188:36.27]What?
[188:36.51]How are you?
[188:37.19]What?
[188:40.61]Nobody brushes their teeth all the way to the back of their throat.
[188:43.25]Who the fuck does that?
[188:44.33]What do you mean, I do?
[188:53.91]You brushed your teeth all the way to the back of your esophagus?
[188:56.31]What the fuck are you talking about?
[188:58.85]Any whoopings done back there, I'll leave you a jug.
[189:02.01]She'll be doing it.
[189:03.71]I don't know, this movie's audio is terrible.
[189:07.35]You killed out there at the swamp, buddy.
[189:09.27]Yeah, let's hear the rest of it.
[189:12.35]I put five slugs into that critter before it went under.
[189:15.99]Don't go in the sting I ever seen.
[189:19.53]And regular arms on it like a man.
[189:22.63]It was sort of different looking.
[189:24.99]Had suckers on them.
[189:27.71]Like one of them, uh... Like one of them octopus's things.
[189:32.12]How do you know that one... Okay, even like... How do you know what an octopus is?
[189:37.60]One of those octopus's things.
[189:41.24]Just take things off.
[189:42.57]It was an octopus.
[189:51.55]Oh, sure.
[189:52.43]And it weren't no freak gator, neither.
[189:55.63]I've been poaching this country for 40 years, and I ain't never seen nothing like it.
[190:00.77]Well, too bad you didn't bring it back.
[190:03.31]Steve Benton probably paid a fair bounty for whatever it was.
[190:07.16]Bounty?
[190:08.78]I wouldn't touch that critter for all the money ever made.
[190:13.34]And if you seen it, you wouldn't either.
[190:16.16]You better take it easy on this stuff.
[190:17.70]You looking to kind of pique it.
[190:19.76]When are we gonna get some real shit in the public domain?
[190:23.64]I think about this sometimes.
[190:26.18]The public domain always has just dog shit.
[190:31.87]Frankenstein's the only thing we got.
[190:34.83]And Attack of the Giant fucking leeches.
[190:37.33]You bears will see it right quick yourselves.
[190:44.43]Because of Disney.
[190:46.73]I can't wait to see fucking Mickey Mouse do old shitty car commercials.
[190:52.15]Come on down to B&B's auto dealership, huh?
[190:56.05]It's gonna be fucking crazy.
[190:59.62]Mickey Mouse is gonna be selling insurance.
[191:03.02]Just wait.
[191:03.78]When they lose that case in 10 years.
[191:05.18]You made that joke before?
[191:07.54]He's a repeater.
[191:09.52]And here, by the way, here comes the jazz music when there's a lady on the screen and, hold on, we might need to... Might need to move this forward about 15 seconds.
[191:21.46]Look, it's not like I want to be mean or anything like that, Liz, baby.
[191:26.20]I've got a reputation around here.
[191:28.68]These folks have no respect for... Slow flutes.
[191:32.58]And a lady on the screen, didn't you know?
[191:36.73]Won't you please listen to me, Liz, baby?
[191:40.17]Why is this guy dressed like an opera singer?
[191:41.47]This is Dick Rubin.
[191:48.25]Okay.
[192:07.41]Oh, did you tell them there might be a female on the screen?
[192:10.67]Oh, there could be a woman on the screen in 1940.
[192:31.64]Okay, this might be a skip scenario.
[192:33.84]Touch me.
[192:34.34]Who do you think you're talking to?
[192:36.78]Don't touch me.
[192:37.82]You're my wife.
[192:38.80]I'll touch you anytime I feel like it.
[192:40.62]Are they married?
[192:41.27]Where are you going?
[192:51.19]Where are you going?
[192:55.59]This movie sucks.
[192:57.03]I'm going out.
[192:58.97]Maybe I'll be back.
[193:00.95]Maybe I won't.
[193:02.35]Liz, baby, I didn't mean nothing.
[193:04.48]Listen to me.
[193:06.30]I know I've been really looking like Chef Boyardee lately, but, you know, I'm good for it, you know me. ¶¶
[193:34.29]What?
[193:38.85]What?
[193:42.18]Turn the lights on.
[193:42.92]I can't see what's happening.
[193:44.50]This is the movie, man.
[193:45.74]Why is she in a wedding dress?
[193:47.10]Oh, no, she's not.
[193:49.72]These poachers know the swamps like the back of their hand.
[193:54.91]But I'll catch one of them in the actual night, put him away for six months.
[193:57.87]In the meantime, I'll have to be satisfied confiscating their trap lines.
[194:01.54]There's enough traps, won't damage you trying.
[194:04.16]Be careful, darling.
[194:06.06]These people aren't like other folks.
[194:07.94]You know, they'll try and get back at you.
[194:09.96]Let them try.
[194:10.56]Steve, you're a stranger here.
[194:13.55]They've lived this way for generations.
[194:15.89]One man isn't going to change them overnight.
[194:18.34]You're a real worrywart.
[194:20.00]I'm serious, Steve.
[194:21.80]They can be dangerous.
[194:23.44]Shut up, you drunk.
[194:24.39]I'll be careful.
[194:26.07]What?
[194:26.43]Alright.
[194:34.29]Oh, Steve, I love you.
[194:36.81]I love you so much.
[194:37.91]What was that?
[194:43.59]I don't know.
[194:44.35]You get my truck and lock it up.
[194:52.59]Oh, my God!
[195:24.56]Is he eating cereal?
[195:25.90]Listen, Benton.
[195:27.22]What is he eating?
[195:28.26]Is that beef stew?
[195:29.66]Now, as far as this office is concerned, that's the end of it.
[195:32.91]But, Sheriff, I can't see why the... Look, if Lem was killed by anything human, I wouldn't need you to tell me my job.
[195:38.31]And I'm not about to go tromping through the swamp looking for an overgrown gator.
[195:43.35]Sawyer wasn't killed by an alligator.
[195:45.61]Is that so?
[195:46.38]Did you hear that, Morton?
[195:48.34]Game warden Benton says it wasn't a gator killed Lem.
[195:51.82]You can't veto a movie halfway through it.
[195:53.74]Ah, it's been ten- it's been like two hours.
[195:56.08]How has it been... How has it been ten minutes?
[195:57.76]It's been three hours!
[195:58.94]No, we're staying.
[195:59.66]What?
[196:23.04]What was that you said?
[196:24.52]I said go soak your fat head.
[196:26.32]Go soak your fat head.
[196:31.73]Okay.
[196:32.63]Go soak your fat head.
[196:33.79]That boy's looking for bad trouble.
[196:36.09]And he's sure gonna get it.
[196:38.51]You can bet on that.
[196:46.47]It's a good thing he's 11.
[196:47.89]Otherwise, I would have been really mad at him.
[196:49.49]The octopi uses its suction discs to hold its prey.
[196:52.83]Now, in itself, the disk will not inflict a wound.
[196:55.07]Same is true of the squid.
[196:57.35]Now, both creatures have a parrot-like beak as their primary offensive and defensive weapon.
[197:02.35]Well, maybe the sheriff was right, Dad.
[197:05.98]Could be a freak or a malformed alligator.
[197:09.76]No.
[197:11.24]No, I'm afraid it wasn't.
[197:13.88]Well, where does that leave us, Doc?
[197:16.20]I wish I knew.
[197:16.84]You know, I'm beginning to think Lem was telling the truth in Walker's store.
[197:22.54]He did see something that night.
[197:25.10]Something that had intelligence enough to seek him out and destroy him later.
[197:28.38]Thanks for the tea.
[197:30.54]This guy's jacked.
[197:31.68]Look at this guy's fucking arms.
[197:34.18]This guy's huge.
[197:35.68]Nothing could live after being hit with those slugs.
[197:38.67]Well, conceding the possibility of one such creature, we must also concede the possibility of others.
[197:48.00]Oh, there's one sure way of finding out.
[197:49.44]Go in and search every backwater channel and wet spot in the swamp.
[197:51.52]If it's there, I'll find it.
[197:52.56]Sure is flying around here.
[198:20.12]You hear something?
[198:25.00]Yes.
[198:28.62]Well, whatever it was, it's not here anymore.
[198:37.24]Do you want some coffee?
[198:39.85]Yeah, thanks, ma'am.
[198:42.11]I thought I could hide in here and never be noticed.
[198:46.11]Well, one did.
[198:46.45]What?
[198:47.55]The Seminoles under Osceola in the 1830s.
[198:49.34]This movie's so bad.
[198:49.92]What do you want me to do?
[198:50.80]This is the second movie.
[198:51.44]We tried.
[198:52.32]This is the second finale.
[198:53.86]This is finale two.
[198:54.46]I...
[199:26.56]We want more Ritz Brothers.
[199:27.84]I- me too!
[199:28.78]I know, I really do.
[199:29.94]I'm asking for the last time, Dave Walker.
[199:38.09]You're asking me to do your man?
[199:40.23]I can do it, Liz, baby.
[199:41.43]Liz, baby.
[199:41.97]We've got an interesting scene.
[199:43.27]Hold on.
[199:43.51]Can't you think of anything else to say, stupid?
[199:45.45]I've got to get this order over to Ms.
[199:46.79]Chauvet.
[199:47.25]She's one of my better customers.
[199:49.71]Can't keep her waiting.
[199:51.34]This is Fat Han Solo.
[199:53.64]The fuck are you talking about?
[200:08.37]Where are the leeches?
[200:09.43]I played Half-Life.
[200:14.72]I love the physics.
[200:16.66]It's fun to play with stuff.
[200:18.20]Have some trouble, Dave?
[200:20.62]You no living, Cal.
[200:22.04]Gotta get the hair down every now and then.
[200:25.27]You sure don't know an awful lot about females.
[200:28.57]I gotta hand it to you.
[200:29.53]Is that all his stuff?
[200:30.87]I can't stand here at John, Cal.
[200:32.83]Yeah, all I got is a few bags of rice, a couple of shelf-stable almond milks, and elbow macaroni.
[200:39.83]Yeah, it's all my stuff, Frank.
[200:41.25]Ever since Lem got himself killed, I don't own anything else.
[200:44.31]...sell out and move into town.
[200:46.76]Don't you let her bamboozle you, Dave.
[200:49.44]Thank you, uh, Nick, for the- for the community- five community- we had so much money coming!
[201:15.92]Do you guys even give a shit about this movie?
[201:18.92]A ton of money coming.
[201:24.34]I mean, this is not a gorilla movie or an aliens movie, so who cares?
[201:28.74]Thanks for the five subs, Nick.
[201:31.29]Dub the movie?
[201:32.23]Sure.
[201:36.91]Would you like some dinner?
[201:42.15]Sounds good to me.
[201:49.39]Look, it's a copy of the Bible.
[201:52.51]Oh, I love the Bible.
[201:53.88]No, I can't do this.
[201:54.86]No, no, no.
[201:55.30]I can't do this.
[201:56.62]I can't do this.
[201:57.16]I can't do this.
[201:57.76]I can't do this.
[201:58.92]No, I can't do this right now.
[201:59.88]No, I cannot.
[202:00.48]Me too.
[202:01.48]You got to know your strengths and this is not one of them right now.
[202:03.34]Come on over here.
[202:05.54]No, no, no.
[202:07.57]I'm not going to get that one on me.
[202:08.89]No.
[202:11.29]Not drunk enough.
[202:12.21]No, I, no.
[202:13.43]You got to know when to stop.
[202:14.45]And that's why.
[202:14.81]What do you mean?
[202:20.75]You know, we've covered miles of back channel and haven't come across anything.
[202:25.87]Where are the leeches, dude?
[202:28.45]Not so much as a mutt.
[202:29.51]I didn't mean anything against you.
[202:33.13]You said a nice word to me.
[202:36.53]Miss Dave.
[202:38.97]That's it.
[202:41.01]I wish it had been me.
[202:42.47]Wait, did he just say to God, I wish that was me?
[202:47.33]What?
[202:48.67]God, I wish that was me.
[202:49.63]He didn't.
[202:50.17]What the fuck?
[202:53.79]No way.
[203:12.95]You're wrong, woman.
[203:14.79]It's too late for the both of you.
[203:17.29]What?
[203:17.87]Who?
[203:18.67]Get up.
[203:18.99]Come on, get up.
[203:23.41]Now, look, Dave, I know what you're thinking, but... Wait, God, I wish that was me.
[203:28.13]It is you.
[203:29.21]You're making out with this woman.
[203:32.61]It is you.
[203:36.83]No point getting riled, Dave.
[203:38.35]It wasn't my fault when...
[203:41.23]Imagine making out with some girl and going, God, I wish this was me.
[203:45.59]Um, it is you.
[203:47.49]Oh, sorry.
[203:48.55]I've just been on Twitch for so long, I've been writing that.
[203:51.10]Since I was, like, fucking 12.
[203:53.08]Come on, get up.
[203:56.18]No, he killed me.
[203:57.22]He killed me.
[203:57.84]Jump.
[203:58.88]Your husband wants to take a look at you.
[204:06.40]You, uh, you walk all the way, Dave?
[204:08.80]One more step and I'll blow your plum in two.
[204:15.69]Exit, exit.
[204:17.65]I'm not playing that again.
[204:19.53]I'm not playing it again.
[204:21.07]That's not gonna play either.
[204:25.89]This guy, Yosemite Sam?
[204:45.86]Where are the leeches?
[204:46.96]It's been 25 fucking minutes!
[205:03.43]There was a leech in the very beginning of the movie, yeah.
[205:19.57]The leech is the friends we made along the way.
[205:50.97]Go on, run!
[205:52.52]Until you drop!
[206:57.12]Keep going.
[206:59.46]Dave, please, you gotta listen.
[207:02.02]It wasn't my fault, honest.
[207:03.42]She kept playing up to me every time you turned your back.
[207:06.17]It wasn't my fault.
[207:08.53]You call yourself a man?
[207:11.07]You're your muscle.
[207:12.09]Shut up, you tramp.
[207:13.85]What was that?
[207:14.79]I wasn't sure I would be in this thing.
[207:17.37]And my old friend Dave would be doing this thing to me.
[207:20.68]It's all your fault.
[207:22.22]Wait, did he shoot him?
[207:46.54]Wait, he shot him?
[207:48.64]When?
[207:49.44]No, that wasn't me.
[207:51.27]He shot him.
[207:52.73]I didn't put that in.
[207:54.35]He shot him.
[208:07.35]I'm sorry, honey.
[208:09.51]I'm sorry, Dave.
[208:12.33]I'm sorry.
[208:13.29]I didn't mean it.
[208:16.23]I'm sorry.
[208:18.03]You think you'll learn enough to stay away from a woman, Cal?
[208:23.00]Anything, Dave.
[208:24.44]I'm moving here.
[208:25.42]I'm going out of the county.
[208:27.92]I'll do anything you say, Dave.
[208:29.14]Anything.
[208:29.84]Alright.
[208:33.17]What are you spamming?
[208:35.09]Why?
[208:35.49]What are you spamming?
[208:40.71]God drops to the floor.
[208:41.97]Eyes pop out of sockets.
[208:44.32]I come to my trumpets.
[208:45.18]Heart beats out of chest.
[208:47.22]Awooka.
[208:47.64]Awooka.
[208:48.28]Sound effect.
[208:49.06]Post chain on triangle.
[208:50.86]That's appeared next to head as steam flows out.
[208:54.74]Slams fist on table.
[208:57.32]Rattling any plates or bowls or silverware.
[209:01.87]Fireworks.
[209:04.89]Can I skip?
[209:31.45]I want to see the leech.
[209:32.49]Oh, my God.
[209:32.91]My head hurts.
[209:33.67]Oh, my God.
[209:34.99]Alright.
[209:36.47]Alright.
[209:36.89]Yeah.
[209:37.40]Stop.
[209:37.68]Stop.
[209:37.80]Stop.
[209:37.96]Stop.
[209:38.18]I read it.
[209:38.60]I got it.
[209:39.18]I got it.
[209:56.52]Behind you!
[210:03.74]It... What is it?
[210:06.97]I can't even see it.
[210:11.75]Just one of the security... Them bodies are still in there.
[210:14.91]You can bet some old bull gators got them stuffed in his cave under the bank, letting them ripen up for a few days.
[210:22.79]Oh, my God, my head hurts from laughing.
[210:24.28]That was a leech?
[210:27.08]Oh.
[210:27.22]Too far forward.
[210:28.06]How?
[210:28.46]What?
[210:28.58]Two seconds.
[210:29.00]I'm sorry, Doc.
[210:29.74]I can't do it.
[210:48.37]Wait, who's dead?
[210:49.07]Why is he 5,000 feet away?
[210:49.61]He's two miles away.
[210:50.67]Don't skip.
[210:51.02]I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
[211:16.09]We've been together the last three days.
[211:17.89]He didn't see a trace of anything unusual.
[211:21.09]Not so much as a suggestion of any form of life unknown to us.
[211:25.11]Steve, shot and killed those people.
[211:27.80]Alright, I'll admit Sawyer's death left a lot of questions unanswered.
[211:31.50]But you can bet your bottom dollar the other two died from Dave Walker's shotgun.
[211:35.54]Do you really believe that?
[211:37.06]He's a real psycho.
[211:38.34]Did you hear the cartoon noises that came out of his gun?
[211:41.20]How could you trust him after that?
[211:42.98]He shot them and he tried to place the blame on Sawyer's DTs.
[211:46.47]The best part of this movie was the dick-rubbing name.
[211:48.67]Yeah, sure.
[211:48.97]That's the highlight.
[212:16.53]Oh, look, Doc, Nan and I were all over that swamp.
[212:18.78]God damn it.
[212:19.52]Why didn't these monsters attack us?
[212:21.62]I've been thinking about that.
[212:23.30]They're probably night creatures.
[212:24.94]They can't stand the light.
[212:25.92]They stay down near the bottom during the day.
[212:29.04]A small charge would stun them, bring them to the surface.
[212:32.71]Can't buy it, Doc.
[212:34.35]You're pig-headed, Steve Benton.
[212:37.53]Stubborn and pig-headed.
[212:39.97]You just don't understand, do you?
[212:48.62]Good night, Doc.
[212:53.68]What was that?
[213:02.81]I didn't do that.
[213:03.75]What?
[213:04.07]What?
[213:04.41]What?
[213:04.79]What?
[213:32.18]Viewers plummeting I've read one person they said please put farts on and I was like no, but then that one person had power You was caught like cow, what would you do?
[213:52.75]I can't take this anymore.
[213:55.05]We can't skip it.
[214:17.86]When I started, I started watching, I can't, oh, that's comedy fucking liquor.
[214:23.00]That makes me happy.
[214:23.64]Okay, I'm going to keep it on.
[214:29.93]Right on seasonable.
[214:33.97]Show is funny.
[214:35.41]Huh?
[214:37.17]Ain't you noticed anything?
[214:38.97]Oh, what?
[214:39.69]We've been prodding around you all morning.
[214:42.29]Ain't run across a single gator.
[214:45.86]By rights, this boot should be crawling with him.
[214:48.66]A huge canoe, holy shit!
[214:50.46]Wait, action!
[215:16.55]Wait, what's normal?
[215:18.57]What's normal?
[215:30.34]Wait, I think he... What?
[215:38.51]It's just trash bags.
[215:41.47]Sentient trash bags?
[215:45.04]He was pretending.
[215:46.04]What the fuck?
[216:15.33]Dude, this is kinda fucked up, actually.
[216:17.45]I guess they are getting eaten.
[216:45.91]Actually kind of scary.
[216:46.97]Yeah, actually kind of scary.
[216:47.89]Okay, Kylo Ren.
[216:48.21]Relax.
[217:09.74]Swamp trash, he calls them.
[217:11.72]Trash?
[217:12.96]They have about as much regard for him as he has for them.
[217:16.78]When they're worried enough to go to him, you know something's wrong.
[217:21.45]Mrs. Reed said the men went searching for Cal and Mrs. Walker's bodies, and they never returned.
[217:26.57]Cobus says he'll get up a search party if they don't show up in a couple of days.
[217:29.87]What's this person's name?
[217:30.75]Doc, you and Nan take your car and get as many volunteers as you can.
[217:36.05]Tell them to meet me at the old wagon road.
[217:38.42]I'll call Doak Evans and have him bring his dogs.
[217:42.10]Either they're lost or they've had an accident.
[217:43.90]God damn it, there's so much more.
[217:44.96]I hope to heaven you're right.
[217:46.14]Dude, Vito, please!
[218:07.41]I just skipped to the end of the movie.
[218:09.77]I didn't mean to.
[218:10.77]I didn't mean to.
[218:11.53]It's the same scene.
[218:12.63]Oh, God damn it, man.
[218:13.67]Whatever.
[218:13.99]Does it matter?
[218:33.27]I'm sorry.
[218:58.97]Carry that lady.
[219:00.65]All ladies need to be carried in movies from the 30s through the 60s.
[219:05.17]They can't even walk.
[219:07.03]Women can't walk.
[219:08.03]Did you know that?
[219:09.69]From 1930 to 1960, females couldn't walk.
[219:26.44]Wait, is that a Wile E. Coyote explosion machine?
[219:27.96]Wait, he presses the button?

[221:38.24]I'm going to go pee, come back, and we're going to watch some Three Stooges.
[221:58.90]Hope to see you there.
[226:53.47]Okay.
[226:57.57]Hello.
[226:57.87]When are you going to watch Captain Alex?
[227:03.79]I've already seen Captain Alex.
[227:06.96]So, I've already seen it.
[227:09.30]Alright, so Three Stooges.
[227:17.38]What are we going to watch for Three Stooges?
[227:23.17]You haven't watched it with us.
[227:25.85]Hmm.
[227:30.11]I mean, that's true, but... Okay, this is the Three Stooges Punch Drunks.
[227:41.07]I wonder... We'll give it a try.
[227:46.27]This will probably be the last thing we do tonight before we just chill and hang out.
[227:51.53]I gotta ask you, though.
[227:53.53]Very, very important question.
[227:56.21]Would you?
[227:56.63]Hold on.
[228:07.35]Hold on.
[228:13.21]This is the first time we've done this.
[228:16.38]Do you want to do this again?
[228:22.67]Would you like to do this again?
[228:24.32]With other public domain movies?
[228:25.82]If you'd like to, please vote on that poll.
[228:28.48]If not, then let me know.
[228:31.88]This is a trial run.
[228:37.74]Not every week?
[228:38.44]No, no, no.
[228:38.88]It'd be like once a month.
[228:41.74]That's pretty... That's a lot.
[228:45.37]That's 94% to 6.
[228:49.33]That's a lot of people.
[228:54.46]Okay.
[228:55.86]Uh, so we'll get more Ritz Brothers movies.
[228:59.62]I, I don't, do I have to give the link anymore?
[229:02.31]I think.
[229:03.79]I don't think you can, the no's are gonna climb back.
[229:06.63]At this point.
[229:09.41]Uh, this has been a lot of fun though.
[229:15.00]I'm very, very happy with this.
[229:16.58]The first two movies were fucking incredible.
[229:19.44]And then we played some fart noises, you know.
[229:22.49]This is called The Three Stooges and Punch Drunks.
[229:24.77]Let's check this one out.
[229:28.31]And this will take us to the end.

[230:13.27]Yeah, the only cut I've got so far is this one over my eye.
[230:18.11]Oh, mouth open.
[230:19.23]Chew, fucking Moog.

[230:53.67]What the fuck?
[230:56.07]Wait a minute.
[230:57.25]Where have you been?
[230:58.48]Out to lunch.
[231:00.76]Get over there and wait on those customers.
[231:03.88]When fucking violence to strangers was funny.
[231:06.58]Give me the biggest steak in the house.
[231:07.88]Hold on, hold on.
[231:09.84]I ain't had my dessert yet.
[231:12.45]Four slices of burnt toast and a rotten egg.
[231:16.02]Wine toast and a rotten egg?
[231:17.62]Yeah.
[231:18.26]What do you want that for?
[231:19.72]I got a tapeworm and it's good enough for him.
[231:21.89]I know how you feel.
[231:23.13]What do you gentlemen have?
[231:24.31]I want the biggest... You got a tapeworm?
[231:27.83]Three hamburgers for the mugs.
[231:29.71]Three hamburgers.

[231:37.81]Larry always looks like he's been electrocuted 15 seconds before every performance
[232:15.32]This isn't public domain?
[232:18.12]This is not public domain.
[232:23.01]What?
[232:25.49]The fuck are you talking about?
[232:26.67]What?
[232:29.59]Wait, hold on.
[232:30.41]The Three Stooges.

[233:50.98]Oh, give us a break, will you, fellas?
[233:53.22]I'm a citizen, and I... What's the matter?

[234:55.22]Can I do this?
[234:56.52]Is this okay?
[234:59.50]There's a Twitch staff here.
[235:01.00]Link, I know you're watching.
[235:03.13]I can see you.
[235:04.92]As long as I do, like, funny fucking comedy references and how he screams.
[235:08.39]Like, as long as I fucking... That's fair use.
[235:11.89]Is that alright?
[235:19.64]I didn't see it.
[235:20.06]What did he say?
[235:23.76]He said it's okay?
[235:24.86]He said it's fine?
[235:25.90]Okay.
[235:27.24]Back to the fucking violence against strangers.
[235:29.68]Funny.
[235:41.22]Say, you're a born champ.
[235:47.21]Did I do that?
[235:48.63]Sure.
[235:49.03]Yeah, you did.
[235:49.71]What's eating you?
[235:50.41]You're a psycho.
[235:51.03]Don't you remember?
[235:52.41]No.
[235:53.39]Every time I hear that weasel tune, something pops inside of me.
[235:57.54]Then everything goes black.
[236:00.26]Hey, what's the idea?
[236:01.86]You're trying to ruin my business?
[236:03.22]I'm sorry.
[236:04.44]Look at my customers.
[236:06.20]I'm a victim of circumstance.
[236:07.60]What do you think this is, a joint?
[236:09.14]It's that pop the weasel.
[236:10.82]Hey, Fiddler, give us that weasel tune again.
[236:12.72]Maybe you'll punch this guy.
[236:17.58]Don't punch this guy.
[236:18.44]Don't punch the fucking owner of the Pasta Italiano.
[236:22.96]He's gone.
[236:24.18]That guy's gone.
[236:25.14]He's out.
[236:25.68]He's out of here.
[236:26.42]He doesn't exist.
[236:27.52]He's gone.
[236:29.08]He's dead.
[236:30.53]How did he get up there?
[236:31.59]It worked.
[236:32.41]Shake hands with your new manager.
[236:35.40]Boy, we're gonna make a lot of money.
[236:36.96]Come on.
[236:40.28]I need you, too.
[236:42.10]From now on, we're a corporation.
[236:43.53]Where are we going?
[236:44.19]We got a lot of training to do.
[236:52.33]He's not a fucking like... That's not like turning on the... What's the thing called?
[236:58.00]Goddamn jokes.
[236:59.06]You gotta give jokes.
[237:00.10]What's the other thing that grinds up food in your garbage disposal?
[237:04.22]Fuck.
[237:05.50]Goddamn it.
[237:06.09]Whatever.
[237:06.33]Pretend I'm not here.
[237:09.99]What's going on?
[237:13.87]What's the idea?
[237:15.01]He's Joe Biden.
[237:16.71]Oh, you lost your balance, eh?
[237:18.55]The thing that, uh, the, uh, the guy, uh, the thing there, whatever it is.
[237:22.16]I don't know.
[237:23.56]I know you had a tough day, kid.
[237:24.46]How do you feel now?
[237:30.62]Oh, you're in great shape, K.O.
[237:32.36]You, gentlemen.
[237:34.61]Where's that, what?
[237:35.37]I'm having a little trouble.
[237:40.37]I wonder if you could help me.
[237:42.67]How did they get here?
[237:43.25]That probably hurts.
[237:44.16]They hurt each other in real life.
[237:45.64]Honda Civic's a good car.
[237:47.22]Sorry.
[237:47.46]Moe, fucking wrong.
[237:48.14]Yeah.
[237:48.30]Hey, Keo.
[238:12.80]Don't sit there like a dummy.
[238:13.84]Come over here.
[238:18.10]Give me a hand.
[238:19.38]Which one?
[238:21.57]Get on the bumper.
[238:22.97]Wait a minute.
[238:24.03]We need more help.
[238:25.03]Where's Larry?
[238:25.77]I can't wait till these guys are Fortnite characters.
[238:31.91]We added skins.
[238:34.07]Curly, Moe, and Larry.
[238:35.17]Take it easy, kid.
[238:38.28]What's wrong with you?
[238:39.10]Wait a minute.
[238:40.16]Wait, look at this.
[238:42.16]Here come the leeches.
[238:43.28]Give K.O.
[238:43.52]a couple of bars of weasel.
[239:22.19]Oh!
[239:22.67]My foot!
[239:23.07]Hey, Carly, get it off!
[239:25.29]I can't budge it!
[239:26.97]Or do something!
[239:27.95]Clarowasia music again!
[239:29.01]What are you standing around for?
[239:30.51]Do something!
[239:33.02]This lady's what?
[239:34.26]She's a stock image.
[239:37.48]Pardon me, stock image lady.
[239:39.36]We got to get this guy's foot out of the car.
[239:42.04]They'll be in Fortnite.
[240:05.59]Trust me.
[240:08.37]A couple years.
[240:08.99]Give it a couple years.
[240:17.11]I'll be right.
[240:17.61]That's fine.
[240:29.63]I'm so afraid you'll get hurt, honey.
[240:31.67]Don't worry about me, dear.

[246:42.52]Alright, why does everybody from, like, the 30s have such weird body types?
[246:47.05]This guy's supposed to be jacked, but he looks like fucking Taffy.
[246:52.13]He's got, like, a big fat stomach and, like, weird breasts and googly arms.
[246:57.72]Like, this is not like... He's not fit.

[247:12.05]His arms are small.
[247:13.05]His hands are small.
[247:16.95]His chest is small.
[247:19.27]But he's got a big fucking stomach, though.
[247:21.67]That means he's jacked in the 30s.
[247:27.85]He has two back muscles.
[247:31.37]Uh, biting is illegal.
[247:38.56]He's going back to the store?
[247:42.33]What is going on?
[247:46.15]What's the matter here?
[247:50.65]Time out!
[247:58.02]Time out!
[247:58.84]He can't take a time out.

[271:10.18]I'm recovering from coronavirus.
[271:12.88]And even though laughing makes my chest worse,
[271:16.06]Your streams have helped me keep my head up.
[271:18.10]Thanks for all you do.
[271:21.28]Hopefully you recover really soon.
[271:25.98]Take care of yourself.
[271:27.78]Drink lots of water.
[271:28.60]And stay isolated.
[271:33.93]Thanks for the $3.
[271:34.37]Hey, Vic for First Noble.
[271:39.27]Thanks for $5.
[271:42.05]If the gorilla is so smart, how come it's a gorilla and not a human?
[271:47.36]Because the movie was made in 1939.
[271:48.56]They didn't fucking understand anything.
[271:53.28]They knew smoke cigarettes and break walls.
[271:56.84]That's what they did.
[271:59.68]Hey, Banjo Boy, thanks for 250.
[272:01.42]Fun fact!
[272:03.00]Santa Claus Conquers the Martians was the first appearance of Mrs. Claus in any media.
[272:08.37]Really?
[272:09.73]Really?
[272:11.70]Most people think that the Claymation Rudolph holds this title.
[272:15.64]But no.
[272:16.66]Santa Claus Conquers the Martians came out a couple months before.
[272:20.02]I've watched this movie like 18 times.
[272:22.87]I have no idea why.
[272:25.19]It was fun watching with you, though.
[272:26.99]Thanks for a fun night.
[272:29.21]We barely watched it, but... Atlantis, thanks for $10.
[272:35.17]Here are your royalties for my use of the Rat Birthday song.
[272:40.35]When I wash my hands.
[272:43.78]Thanks.
[272:46.46]That song is free.
[272:48.78]You don't have to pay me money.
[272:50.00]That song is free.
[272:52.76]But thanks for the thousand bits.
[272:56.09]Hey, freak out.
[272:56.85]Thanks for the $5, Jerva.
[272:58.80]If you want some old dramatic movies, you should watch 12 Angry Men for the best years of our lives.
[273:05.54]Or if you want something to watch in your personal time, watch a thing that could be porn.
[273:11.41]And I'm not going to say it out loud.
[273:14.39]Thanks for the $5.
[273:14.79]Hey, Ubermorphpoint, thanks for $15, Ubermorphpoint.
[273:26.54]If you do another one of these, you should watch Who Killed Captain Alex?
[273:30.76]I've seen it.
[273:32.48]Ugandan action movie free on YouTube.
[273:35.31]I've seen that whole movie.
[273:36.37]It's fantastic.
[273:38.69]I'd like to see things on movie night that I've never seen.
[273:44.09]Things that I've never seen before.
[273:49.00]I've seen that one.
[273:54.83]Uh, Dr. Zoot Suit, thanks for the $7.
[273:56.27]Hey, Jerma, glad the stream schedule is coming back together.
[274:02.17]Stuff is really wild and stressful for everyone right now.
[274:05.62]And I'm glad stuff is working out for you enough that you can stream again.
[274:09.82]I've been stressed recently since I started school again.
[274:12.18]I can't believe I played Jump King for 10 seconds and deleted the whole save.
[274:18.15]Fuck.
[274:20.08]That sucks.
[274:22.96]Since I started school again and my design is one of the 25 finalists in the Terraria Vanity Contest, if I win and you ever play Terraria again, my design is the TV head outfit.
[274:36.67]Thanks for streaming.
[274:41.87]Thanks for the seven bucks.
[274:44.61]Terraria is a great game.
[274:45.69]That'd be fucking cool if you got some shit in it.
[274:48.55]Can't believe I deleted my whole save account on Jump King.
[274:53.11]Thanks for the seven bucks.
[274:55.45]Peaceful Haley.
[274:56.19]250 from Peaceful Haley.
[274:59.60]So happy you're doing a movie night.
[275:00.72]The riffing makes it even better.
[275:02.80]Thanks for being entertaining.
[275:03.78]Good night, Jerma and Chat.
[275:07.68]I think it was a success.
[275:08.68]I had a lot of fun.
[275:10.57]I'm having a great time.
[275:12.01]This has been a blast.
[275:13.85]I hope you had fun.
[275:20.70]Thanks for the $3.50.
[275:23.47]Bela Lissosi was a master theater and movie actor in the 20s and early 30s and extremely popular thanks to his role in Dracula.
[275:34.14]The gorilla was filmed in the period when his career was on the decline and was mostly typecasted and relegated to bit parts.
[275:44.40]By the time Plan 9 was filmed, he was destitute and addicted to morphine.
[275:50.40]Holy shit.
[275:52.58]He died halfway through production.
[275:54.18]By the way, this was fun.
[275:56.16]Wait, what?
[275:57.78]He died halfway through production.
[276:02.81]That's fucking horrible.
[276:06.51]Also, I might suggest Freaks.
[276:09.59]1932.
[276:09.61]That's sad and terrible.
[276:15.46]That was the guy that used the cape?
[276:17.74]Oh, I fucking made fun of- that was- oh, I feel bad.
[276:26.73]Oh, that's why they covered his face.
[276:29.87]Shit.
[276:31.47]Uh, thanks for the 250 vrim thrall.
[276:34.66]The bellow with the cape up against his face is actually a double.
[276:39.91]Bella Lugosi died partway through into filming Plan 9.
[276:43.13]Plan 9 was also Lugosi's final film.
[276:46.39]On a lighter note, this whole stream has been golden.
[276:50.07]Thanks for the laughs.
[276:51.75]I'm glad we can come together and have some fun.
[276:55.80]I had a few drinks.
[276:56.86]It's all good.
[276:57.60]You know, whatever.
[276:58.14]I played Jump King, deleted my save.
[277:00.50]Embarrassing.
[277:01.36]What an embarrassing asshole.
[277:03.56]Fancy Boots, thanks for $2.50.
[277:06.21]Correction!
[277:07.67]Plan 9 was technically, technically, Lugosi's final film.
[277:15.67]It was released in 1959.
[277:18.59]But his appearance is comprised of old footage recorded before his passing.
[277:26.46]Hmm.
[277:27.88]Interesting tip.
[277:31.52]You're a movie nerd.
[277:35.12]Uh, Blaine.
[277:37.55]Blaine's Magmar thanks to 250.
[277:38.99]Uh, Jerma, as a public health major, I want to say that you are doing a great service just by making the quarantine more fun.
[277:47.09]You'll always be my favorite streamer.
[277:50.12]He has no idea what the fuck he's saying.
[277:51.74]What?
[277:52.16]Yes, I do.
[277:52.70]I'm not like that far gone.
[277:53.92]Jesus, give me some slack.
[277:57.02]I've had some drinks.
[277:57.82]That doesn't mean I'm like fucking stupid.
[278:01.21]Oh, he's gone.
[278:02.65]He didn't have any idea what he's saying.
[278:04.45]Where is he?
[278:04.89]He's five.
[278:05.79]He's a five-year-old.
[278:11.49]Give me some slack, for Christ's sake.
[278:13.21]It's been like five hours of drinking.
[278:16.52]Eh, whatever.
[278:19.10]Hey, Dark Pie Lord, thanks for the five dollars.
[278:25.49]Jerem, a fun fact about Plan 9 from Outer Space, every shot featuring Bela Lugosi was actually unused footage from a different movie Ed Wood had shot years earlier.
[278:47.40]That's sad.
[278:53.27]So much Lugosi lore, I know.
[279:03.88]I'm not laughing at that.
[279:09.00]No, I'm not.
[279:09.88]I'm not laughing at some person.
[279:11.60]Hmm.
[279:16.76]Difficulty thanks to 250.
[279:22.24]In case you didn't know, the backstory of Plan 9, Bela Lugosi that played the vampire was dead years before the movie.
[279:48.87]I know the guy's dead, okay?
[279:50.07]I get it.
[279:53.04]I know, he covered his face because after the actor wasn't Legassi, the footage where you see his face is leftover footage.
[280:06.03]I'm not laughing at that, I'm laughing at chat being fucking hilarious.
[280:10.75]Ah, yeah, Bela Legassi's dead, I know.
[280:13.55]This is like six messages in a row.
[280:16.29]I know he's dead, I know, and he was replaced.
[280:29.86]Please do The Great Dictator.
[280:31.54]Pretty sure it's public domain.
[280:32.88]It's great.
[280:33.78]Thank you, Devakitty.
[280:36.60]Okay, I gotta fucking get it together.
[280:45.16]Hole of one zombie.
[280:46.22]Thanks for 250.
[280:46.88]This was amazing.
[280:52.75]I recommend any early Jackie Chan film in public domain.
[280:57.14]Or Ninja Dragon if it's on YouTube.
[280:59.54]Not sure if it's public domain.
[281:02.20]Terribly dubbed Jackie Chan films are brilliant.
[281:05.42]Don't think they're public domain.
[281:10.30]Appreciate it though.
[281:10.81]Thank you.
[281:14.91]Femme Enting Dregs.
[281:18.13]This was $25. $25.
[281:21.67]Commenting dregs.
[281:26.49]Here's half the cost of what a movie ticket was going to in about a year from now.
[281:38.06]The way things were going.
[281:39.18]I'll be keeping going in these times.
[281:41.64]I have a blast.
[281:43.02]I'm having a blast so far.
[281:43.96]$25 for a movie ticket, yeah.
[281:49.17]Did I read that wrong?
[281:50.55]Probably.
[281:51.97]Thank you for a better movie night than I've seen in the past five years in the old facilities known as theaters.
[281:57.62]Here's half the cost of what a movie ticket was going to in about a year from now, the way things were going.
[282:05.60]Hope you keep these things going.
[282:07.16]It's been a blast so far.
[282:08.36]I did it right?
[282:11.64]I read that word for word.
[282:12.94]That's correct.
[282:24.05]Hey, Evangelion!
[282:27.98]The room is spinning?
[282:29.04]No, it's not.
[282:29.56]Not even close.
[282:32.38]Hey, guess what?
[282:33.86]Plan 9 was actually the last film of Bela Lugosi.
[282:37.84]The reason his face is hidden throughout most of the film, either by his cape or by filming, is because it's actually a stand-in.
[282:45.11]The shots that actually show his face were filmed for unrelated projects, then repurposed for this film.
[283:06.67]I'm not reading the same bits.
[283:22.06]After his death, in the order to draw in more of an audience, they said it was Bela Lugosi's final film.
[283:29.11]Lugosi likely never met any of the actors in Plan 9.
[283:38.62]Any more fun facts?
[283:41.04]That's so funny.
[283:45.18]A phylactery lich gave 50 fucking dollars and I missed it, but they said these fucking aliens have space travel and guns that control dead bodies, but humans have gone too far.
[283:58.49]Oh my god.
[284:04.42]Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[284:09.14]Hey, Flim Flam.
[284:11.41]Five dollars are gonna perp.
[284:15.81]I can't turn.
[284:16.47]I can't mute it.
[284:17.25]Why?
[284:18.29]Why can't I mute this?
[284:19.71]What the fuck?
[284:21.95]I tried.
[284:22.63]What the fuck?
[284:23.27]Stream Deck.
[284:23.81]What the fuck?
[284:25.25]Stream Deck, what are you doing?
[284:26.67]Mute this.
[284:32.39]It won't mute.
[284:32.97]I don't know why.
[284:34.57]It sucks.
[284:37.08]Flim Flam, thanks for the five dollars.
[284:39.32]Thanks for the stream.
[284:43.74]I'd like to recommend the Pink Panther Strikes again.
[284:46.35]For Public Domain Movie Night 2, whatever that may be.
[284:50.87]Fairly certain it's public domain.
[284:52.79]If not, then please watch yourself.
[284:55.09]If you haven't already, here's the link.
[284:58.04]Watch yourself?
[284:58.70]I think we've done that before.
[285:03.24]Hey, Jerma, do you know that Bela Lugosi is dead?
[285:07.94]Stop, that's so easy to make me laugh right now.
[285:14.75]Flim Flam, another $5.
[285:16.21]I forgot you turned links off.
[285:20.63]Just search Uncle Carl, Uncle Earl's Classic TV Channel Pink Panther Strikes Again.
[285:27.31]It's the first link.
[285:29.35]What?
[285:30.69]Uncle Carl's Pink Panther Strikes Again.
[285:37.42]What the fuck's happening?
[285:46.28]I got it.
[285:50.22]Uh, is this public domain, though?
[285:51.66]I don't think it is.
[285:52.24]Gotta be careful.
[285:54.74]Link is watching.

[286:28.05]Please make this a reoccurring thing.
[286:30.49]The stream has made me laugh out loud more than anything else this month.
[286:34.00]Movies are more fun when you watch them with 7,000 other people.
[286:38.00]Also, you should add Frog to the list.
[286:41.48]And its sequel, Frogs.
[286:44.09]They're both on YouTube.
[286:49.85]Oh, what's that?

[287:17.49]Uh, WolfBull, thanks for $5.
[287:21.74]Uh, did we really think that the ADHD streamer wasn't going to skip scenes and play fart and scream sound effects?
[287:27.70]I don't know.
[287:30.42]I sent the message too early.
[287:32.46]I meant to say that I wouldn't have had it any other way.
[287:35.97]Thank you for taking my fart sound effect suggestion.
[287:38.35]God damn it.
[287:41.43]Abomination Zero, $15.
[287:43.49]Lots of fucking money.
[287:44.41]You have to do some Three Stooges shit.

[287:50.31]I will.
[287:52.35]I promise.
[287:55.96]But what about Bela Lugosi?
[287:57.54]Is he dead?
[288:05.78]Autumn Dragons, thanks for the $2.50.
[288:08.79]Thanks.
[288:36.99]Hey, Snoozencopter250, thanks for 250.
[288:42.02]Today, after watching all these old movies and you making for the Fortnite YouTuber comment thing, comedy really hasn't progressed at all.
[288:49.34]Every single YouTube and streamer comedy routine consists out of making loud, funny, random noises and getting hurt in-game.
[289:01.49]That will exist for the next thousand years.
[289:04.27]Sorry to say.
[289:06.53]A Lars Blood Axe, thanks for $5 Charlie Chaplin made a movie called Gold Rush in which he consumes a shoe It's fate It must be watched Jerma put Sun Chips in F tier, thanks for $2.50 More stream days, less stream hours, Kappa Ban that person for fucking 10 years

[289:48.77]I was kidding.

[289:51.12]I'm so sorry The fucking stream is over anyways, who cares Jay ran Cree.
[289:59.10]Thanks for $15
[290:01.82]So there's going to be another Jump King stream where you beat it all over again, right?
[290:06.42]Hope so the first time around was the best.
[290:08.93]Either way, MovieNet was great.
[290:10.05]Let's do it again.
[290:10.55]I agree.
[290:16.81]Did I actually delete the whole fucking thing?
[290:20.59]So bad.
[290:22.75]Why would you put that on the... Why would you put that on the menu?
[290:28.83]I don't know.

[290:31.99]Thanks for five dollars You should do a red baron night tomorrow night where you play the old red baron games while eating red baron pizza I Don't think so Your ranch thanks for five dollars I Missed about half the stream, so I'm really excited to watch the VOD but you have no idea how happy this movie stream idea makes me I
[290:58.06]Older movies, mostly sci-fi and horror, also the B-movie variety, are a big interest of mine.
[291:05.15]So I'm really happy to watch some with everyone.
[291:10.21]The issue with these bad movies is that they're really hit or miss, and a lot are slow with gold nuggets in them periodically.
[291:17.64]Regardless, it was fun as hell.
[291:20.42]I think we hit fucking gold the first four hours, three or four hours.
[291:28.82]those first two movies were perfect and then I drank too much and the third movie was terrible that's pretty much it uh lm man thanks for the 250.
[291:44.07]If you're going to play Sam & Max Season 3, I won't.
[291:47.23]Have you ever considered playing Strong Bad's cool games for attractive people?
[291:50.47]It's made by Telltale.
[291:51.47]I will not.
[291:53.06]I'm not going to play Sam & Max Season 3.
[291:54.84]It didn't grab me.
[291:56.52]It wasn't a fan.
[291:58.10]I'm sorry.
[291:59.46]That's just the way it is.
[292:03.26]Hey, Cheemtreese, thanks for $3.
[292:05.42]I can't wait to see the giant leeches in Jermania.
[292:07.58]They won't be there.
[292:09.04]It would be sucked.
[292:11.73]Cigar and a Waffle, thanks for $5.
[292:15.01]Remember, why did you become so hideous?
[292:19.37]It's called going past 35.
[292:21.09]Happens to everybody.
[292:24.32]Sorry it happened to me.
[292:27.68]You posted cringe, bro.
[292:29.66]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[292:31.70]Wait, is it over?
[292:32.44]I thought you were watching multiple movies.
[292:34.78]That's why I'm just now tuning in.
[292:36.98]Looks like I'm the clown here.
[292:38.32]Pepe hands.
[292:41.11]We watched three movies and one Three Stooges TV show.
[292:51.82]I don't know when you got here, but you probably don't remember the third movie, dude.
[293:01.20]We watched three.
[293:04.94]The leech counts.
[293:06.94]Even though we skipped 30 minutes, it counts.
[293:11.22]Gooberry Juice, thanks for 250.
[293:12.76]Hey, pal.
[293:13.37]Hey, pal.
[293:14.71]I hate to do this to you, especially since I can tell you're having so much fun, but I'm going to have to write you up for a SUI.
[293:23.35]That's right, streaming under the influence.
[293:25.71]I mean, we can all have fun here or there, but deleting your save, it's fine if chat does it, but you're the designated driver of this stream, not us.
[293:34.95]No, the only way to pay this off is if you raid Rift Tracks.
[293:38.14]You know, considering you basically ripped off... You ripped off their entire career.
[293:47.68]Whatever.
[293:51.31]Mike Nelson's fucking hilarious.
[293:52.69]Mike Nelson's a huge influence on my life.
[293:54.85]You got it.
[293:55.23]Are they alive?
[293:58.77]We'll rate somebody else.
[294:00.27]I've rated Rift Tracks like last week.
[294:01.83]They're fucking fantastic.
[294:02.95]They're great guys.
[294:04.25]Gooberry, thanks for the $2.50 again.
[294:06.16]No, that's a lie.
[294:08.00]It's the same message.
[294:10.22]Dr. Clay, thanks for $5.
[294:13.62]If you ever do this again, please green screen yourself in the lower right as a silhouette.
[294:19.75]That would really be copying Mike Nelson and those MST3K guys, so I don't know if I want to do that.
[294:27.88]Hey, Karunch, $3 from Karunch.
[294:31.02]P.S.
[294:32.08]If we're talking older movies, not sure if you're into the Universal Monsters, but in my opinion, The Invisible Man from 1933 is the absolute best Universal Monster movie they put out.
[294:45.19]I wish it were public domain, because I think it would be a great, fun watch with everyone.
[294:48.78]It's too bad.
[294:51.66]Regardless...
[294:53.58]It's not an obscure recommendation, but I'd still recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen it.
[294:57.88]It's one of my favorite movies in general, actually.
[295:01.02]Thanks again.
[295:04.09]I wish it was in public domain.
[295:05.15]We'd watch it right now.
[295:10.29]Ray DeBellagossi.
[295:12.95]God damn it.
[295:15.73]Hey, Hatchet, thanks for $3.00.
[295:18.75]Thanks for the very fun night.
[295:19.91]Hope we get to watch some Charlie Chaplin next time.
[295:23.22]Probably.
[295:23.56]If we watch Three Stooges this time, why not next time?
[295:29.14]Westule, 1000 bits, $10.
[295:31.38]Jerma, I'm watching this in VR with my best friends.
[295:33.74]Why would you watch this in VR?
[295:36.81]We're all major fans.
[295:37.75]P.S., did you get your hair cut?
[295:39.83]Doesn't look like Lego hair.
[295:41.43]No.
[295:42.95]I smeared it back on the back of my head.
[295:48.79]It's just greasy and smeared back.
[295:51.03]Don't be fooled.
[295:51.55]Hey, Keith King Crimson.
