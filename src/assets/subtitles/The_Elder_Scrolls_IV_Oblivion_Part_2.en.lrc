[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.07]I just turned the stream on because of this nonsense I see in the chat here.
[00:07.47]I see all kinds of emotes.
[00:08.51]I see all, I had to turn it on.
[00:10.55]I'm sitting here trying to enjoy reading and all I can hear is these people typing in the Jupiters.
[00:24.58]I just look over and I've got to turn it on and tell them to be quiet.
[00:27.58]I've got to tell them to be quiet.
[00:29.51]Enough of that.
[00:30.74]I can hear it.
[00:36.16]Hey, welcome to the spring.
[00:42.59]See you guys in a minute.
[01:09.15]Oblivion!
[01:11.52]Well, yes, I'm Marvin the Martian!
[01:13.50]I'm working on Marvin the Martian.
[01:15.26]I did that in the mirror for about four hours before the stream started.
[01:18.52]Did we do okay?
[01:22.80]You think I can send my application into LooneyTunes.com?
[01:28.69]Is tonight the green screen stream?
[01:30.17]No.
[01:31.69]No.
[01:32.99]We're going to go over the real game plan in about two minutes.
[01:38.97]Yep, that's me clapping.
[01:43.21]I never said, when did I, Elder Scrolls, I didn't say that.
[01:49.63]You should probably go back to packing up groceries.
[01:55.85]Get him out, get him out of here.
[01:57.81]Get him out of here.
[02:00.05]Get him out of here.
[02:08.27]No!
[02:13.37]There it is.
[02:14.91]He's gone forever.
[02:20.03]If you're new to the channel, I gotta make sure I'm very clear about this.
[02:24.35]If you make fun of the streamer, and you say something mean to me, and I determine it's for a permanent ban.
[02:32.39]That happens all the time here.
[02:36.45]We'll do it.
[02:38.90]That's a five to ten seconds as permanent ban.
[02:42.26]I mean, that's a long fucking time in dog years.
[02:48.52]Oh, unicorn years.
[02:53.66]Anywho.
[02:55.98]I'm mean.
[02:56.46]I'm not mean.
[03:01.91]Something mean to the streamer.
[03:03.85]You guys are just making a funny joke now.
[03:12.86]a goldfish life sentence what oh I thought you meant like my the thing I said was a goal like a goldfish would have said that because the goldfish is so dumb you know what get rid of that guy we're gonna play oblivion again back to oblivion
[03:38.77]Looking forward to it.
[03:40.17]I'm enjoying the game so far.
[03:41.45]No mods.
[03:43.05]And now I kind of fucked up a little bit here.
[03:48.41]I think enough time has gone by where we can discuss the issue at hand.
[03:52.10]So here's my issue.
[03:53.18]Grab yourself a tissue.
[03:56.46]If you weren't here yesterday, I talked about it a little bit, but I'm not going to have a computer as of tomorrow.
[04:08.21]The shipping process and the moving process to actually be in the house in Vegas begins tomorrow.
[04:14.11]All of my stuff is leaving.
[04:16.85]My microphone... What am I gonna do?
[04:22.25]I'm gonna have to be on webcam microphone for two weeks.
[04:32.91]I'm gonna be the worst streamer on Twitch.
[04:36.29]People are gonna come to the stream and question how in the name of God I ever had more than like 12 people come to my stream.
[04:49.34]But, so, my desk.
[04:53.40]I'm gonna have to stream sitting on the floor.
[04:56.75]My chair, my desk, my monitors.
[05:02.01]I'm keeping one shitty monitor.
[05:05.19]My old ass computer is still here.
[05:07.35]I don't have a desk.
[05:13.19]I'm gonna have to use the headset mic.
[05:14.63]We're gonna have to... It's gonna have to happen.
[05:17.79]I'm gonna have to drive to a random McDonald's.
[05:22.16]And I'm gonna have to try everything on the menu and give you my full review of the whole store.
[05:26.48]Over the course of like three streams.
[05:28.20]I don't know.
[05:28.66]What else am I... What am I gonna do?
[05:33.22]Don't have any I get the consoles can still work, but We're gonna do iPad I'm gonna bring some iPad games back we're gonna tap back into the Dreamcast PlayStation 2 We'll figure it out, but just I want to make sure everyone's well aware of that I
[06:00.65]I have to turn the quality up on this stream.
[06:04.53]I'm going to put the graphics up.
[06:06.99]Because this is the last technical quality stream that you are going to get on this channel until the end of the first week of October.
[06:24.28]quality lul oh come on I'm talking I'm talking technical quality like graphics and bitrate and do you hear the quality of this microphone don't try to tell me that this is a low quality microphone because if you think that then I got scammed this is a very high look okay fine sure well quality what is he talking about
[06:51.71]Oh, yeah.
[06:52.21]He's got such bad quality.
[06:55.05]Yeah.
[06:55.55]This really is too bad.
[06:59.47]Where is it?
[07:01.57]Oh, hold on.
[07:01.89]I think it's disabled.
[07:03.89]Let's see.
[07:04.57]How do I turn it on?
[07:05.69]Let's find out how right you guys are about this.
[07:07.75]Do I have to enable it?
[07:13.95]Uh-oh.
[07:14.75]Okay.
[07:18.56]Alright.
[07:19.78]Let's find out.
[07:24.03]Make sure it's there, and it is.
[07:26.53]So, um, the quality of my speaking voice, as you hear now, is delicate, it's easy on the ears, it's buttery, it's soft.
[07:35.95]And in an instant, turns into this.
[07:40.48]And you're going to try to tell me that the quality of my streams is not at the utmost perfection!
[07:51.00]We're talking from video quality to audio quality to the quality of how comfortable your chair is.
[07:59.43]I did that.
[08:02.87]I made it so it was comfy to be in that chair.
[08:05.11]I made that chair.
[08:08.70]So, as you can see, don't ever tell me that my audio quality is not high.
[08:19.07]Because it is on a level that it's at a completely different level.
[08:28.24]Fucking God.
[08:29.16]Fucking God wouldn't even be able to understand my quality of audio.
[08:36.15]And yes, yes, there is the option that I have.
[08:40.01]Let's talk about jokes here.
[08:42.73]It's not possible though.
[08:43.83]I was going to pre-record two full live streams and have them just schedule go up and just broadcast, but you can't do that.
[08:51.74]It's not possible.
[08:53.60]I don't think I can do it.
[09:01.67]I have to like upload a VOD and then... But somebody has to press the button to broadcast that VOD.
[09:13.75]know what I mean I I'm not I'm not gonna be able to like I'm not gonna have internet I'll do it you can sketch I have to look into that because I want to do a thing where I do I just pretend like I'm just come live for like four hours twice give me your stream key I'll do it for you oh thanks dude Asian turtle yeah I'll just pm to you right now
[09:41.60]Thanks, man.
[09:42.48]I'd really appreciate that.
[09:43.36]Thanks, man.
[09:48.73]Alright, let's play Oblivion.
[09:52.45]No, you know what?
[09:52.97]Let's play it.
[09:53.47]No, I'm not going to do that.
[09:54.59]This is my last time with a quality stream with high density graphics and high intensity audio graphics.
[10:00.80]I can't.
[10:01.24]No, we're not going to turn on the shitty quality.
[10:03.66]I don't want to have to prove to you guys how the quality is.
[10:06.88]I just did it.
[10:14.20]You know what I'm saying?
[10:15.04]Like, I'm about to do the thing that I'm already gonna... I'm gonna do... I was about to make a joke about, hey, listen, you're gonna miss this quality.
[10:21.30]This is the last chance I'm gonna get to do this for, like, three weeks.
[10:24.91]You're gonna see that bad quality in, like, two days, three days.
[10:29.17]So, why do I have to do that?
[10:31.41]Look at the crispness here of the O. You're not gonna see that again.
[10:35.92]Okay, let's go to load.
[10:40.64]Well, I don't know what the hell we were doing.
[10:43.46]Turn on the facecam or riot.
[10:46.09]If you guys start rioting, I'm going to scream as loud as I can into the webcam microphone and try to break it.
[10:51.45]Don't do it.
[11:44.95]Did it work?
[11:50.87]Hold on.
[11:51.63]Let me try it again.
[12:12.84]I think I broke it.
[12:13.52]Hello?
[12:15.46]Tell me if it sounds better.
[12:16.20]Did I fix the microphone?
[12:21.83]It's dead.
[12:22.73]Is it?
[12:22.95]Did I fix the microphone or is it fine?
[12:32.74]Is it broken or is it good to go?
[12:34.20]You tell me, guys.
[12:36.58]I don't know.
[12:37.02]I can't tell you.
[12:54.01]Hey everybody, welcome to another edition of Oblivion with me!
[12:58.29]Hey!
[13:09.74]But it's not, like, now it's not gonna be funny now, right?
[13:12.78]That's the thing about audio quality.
[13:15.75]Now I'm just a guy.
[13:16.91]I'm just like a regular guy.
[13:19.17]I'm not like the fucking mutant that you just heard.
[13:26.79]This isn't funny now.
[13:27.85]Wait, I fixed it?
[13:31.27]Ooh, now I made the quality better.
[13:36.24]Loud is always funny, Jerma, don't you know?
[13:40.98]I know, but like that's... Unfunny streamer.
[13:47.61]Don't, hey.
[13:49.53]Hey.
[13:50.95]Oblivion just crashed, so... I screamed so loud into the microphone that I broke Oblivion.
[13:57.19]Why?
[14:02.41]I actually, I... I have to fucking control-alt-delete.
[14:07.83]I don't even have a mouse now.
[14:11.47]I can't exit out of oblivion.
[14:13.97]Why?
[14:15.25]This is the... Finally, Jesus.
[14:24.97]Hold on, I want to hear what that sounded like.
[14:27.94]Hold on.
[14:28.66]Let me try it again.
[14:45.13]That sounds like a high school fire alarm.
[14:51.93]Hold on.
[14:52.63]I need a better clip.
[14:55.27]I need a clip of the high school fire alarm.
[15:03.90]No, no, I need the fire alarm.
[15:05.94]That's not the fire alarm.
[15:13.60]No, that's not it.
[15:15.46]Oh well, whatever.
[15:20.32]That fire alarm is like perfect.
[15:22.83]Make it use sub sound.
[15:23.97]No.
[15:26.77]What the fuck is this?
[15:31.53]Oh, right, right, right.
[15:32.51]That's the, okay.
[15:33.81]Now I remember what that is.
[15:34.85]We're supposed to be playing Oblivion.
[15:40.11]This is my last quality stream in like three weeks.
[15:42.70]Don't you understand?
[15:43.32]Well, that's not true.
[15:46.44]Something else is going to happen, but.
[16:07.05]This is the last time you're gonna get this kind of quality.
[16:11.35]But it's not loud, nevermind.
[16:20.09]Alright, we're good.
[16:31.59]We just got gnomed.
[16:33.13]He kind of did.
[16:35.29]The whole first 20 minutes of this stream has been a gnome.
[16:41.34]I swear to God, I feel like my audio is broken.
[16:45.24]Is that an enemy?
[16:45.80]No, that's the guy I stole from, isn't it?
[16:48.38]Alright, welcome back to Oblivion.
[16:50.40]Oh, we forgot to talk about the YouTube titling thing.
[16:52.52]Okay, right, so forget about... What is this?
[16:55.46]Who's this guy?
[16:57.37]Oh, okay, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[16:58.75]This is because the guy down here, he told us to go upstairs and go talk to the other guy, and then we go on a little wild goose chase.
[17:04.47]So, I was thinking about what I was going to name the title tonight.
[17:08.43]And we were figuring it out.
[17:10.84]And I thought of... What about just... Somebody wrote, like, just make it Oblivion Part 2.
[17:17.98]And the joke about that is back when you would do YouTube Let's Plays...
[17:23.65]Titling was so difficult if you did a Let's Play.
[17:26.68]That's why I never wanted to do them.
[17:28.20]It wasn't the fact that I, you know, I have the brain of a fucking 11-year-old and, like, I can't commit to one thing for, you know, 50 or 60 videos, right?
[17:38.09]But I wouldn't want to do that anyways.
[17:39.23]I wouldn't want to do that anyways.
[17:40.71]So, when you title a Let's Play...
[17:43.86]It was so incredibly difficult because you had to... Oh, I gotta think of a catchy title for my episode 71 of Oblivion, right?
[17:51.52]So all you would do, this is what everybody does.
[17:54.31]Go and look.
[17:54.97]You can find it.
[17:56.73]It's one sentence inside of the video is what the title is.
[18:03.40]Or one enemy that you may have faced.
[18:11.64]That's it.
[18:12.16]Every single one.
[18:13.44]So you would just be like, oh, eventually they'll get to this point in the video, and then the title will make sense.
[18:22.05]And you always have to put an exclamation mark at the end of your title.
[18:26.31]Because, like, what the fuck, really, your title is the most interesting part of that whole video.
[18:29.76]You know what I mean?
[18:31.41]Because if you did like a full, just full-on blind Oblivion Let's Play on YouTube, you may or may not have like 22 or 30 videos of you doing what I'm doing right here, just walking around looking at stuff.
[18:45.64]Or like in a menu.
[18:52.71]That, like... And by the way, I never agreed with that.
[18:56.61]People that had whole Let's Plays on their channels and it was just like, ready?
[19:00.59]I'm gonna do it.
[19:01.71]Are you ready for an entire video?
[19:06.56]15 minutes.
[19:07.12]Here you go.
[19:11.58]I'm not fucking around.
[19:12.62]We're doing a YouTube video right now.
[19:14.20]Like, I'm not gonna upload anywhere, but here it goes.
[19:18.16]Now imagine if you clicked on this video.
[19:20.72]Remember, this is a YouTube upload.
[19:28.47]So first of all, let's end the last video.
[19:30.47]What do you say, right?
[19:32.35]Okay, let's end the last video and make a new video.
[19:35.23]Here we go.
[19:37.28]Alright, so...
[19:39.66]Cool, cool, cool.
[19:40.76]We got to the tower.
[19:41.74]We got to the middle of the cathedral here.
[19:45.78]And I think we can wrap it up there.
[19:47.38]So I will see you guys in the next one.
[19:51.74]See you later.
[19:55.10]Hey, welcome to another video, guys.
[19:56.56]Welcome back.
[19:57.33]If you missed the last one, we got to Castle Superstore.
[20:01.55]We ended up walking around and we checked out some stuff.
[20:04.73]And now we... What have I got to do now?
[20:07.53]Let's take a look.

[20:44.73]Let me just check.
[20:50.91]Secret cult of Mirren's dragon.
[20:55.99]Heard rumors of an attack on the chapel.
[20:57.65]Ooh, we can do an attack.
[21:00.46]I think I like this one.
[21:07.90]Found a list of locations.
[21:13.79]Okay!
[21:18.82]We're gonna go to this one, I think.
[21:22.92]We're just gonna go to the castle gate here, go to the main gate.

[24:46.02]Alright, I gotta drop this act.
[24:52.42]Somebody just gave $50.
[24:56.60]But anyways, that's the secret to making... You wonder how somebody made... Wow, I wonder how that person makes like 15 videos a week.
[25:06.55]Well, that's how they did it.
[25:08.75]You just recorded like five of them in a row.
[25:15.55]YouTube sponsorships.
[25:18.55]You just recorded, if you could make like 10 videos a week, you were doing shit like this.
[25:25.07]And look, to each their own.
[25:29.09]But hold on, I can't, I can't, if I alt-tab here, it's probably gonna break the game.

[25:35.50]I gotta get over there quick.
[25:41.50]Oh, come on, come on, come on, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[25:48.07]I'm, like, still doing the voice.
[25:49.41]Thanks for the $50, dude.
[25:52.54]Uh, your videos suck.
[25:53.38]You should stop making them and quit YouTube.
[25:54.92]You suck.
[25:55.36]I hate you.
[25:57.24]Holy shit.
[26:00.30]Thank you, Killcode, for the $50.
[26:03.87]Really appreciate that, dude.
[26:06.51]Thanks so much, man.
[26:08.51]Alright, so what are we actually supposed to do here?
[26:11.61]Attacking the chapel in Anvil, no one seems to know what happened, but all the priests and priestesses were killed, and the authors desecrated.
[26:18.56]It might be worth going to Anvil to see for myself.
[26:20.38]Alright, so I kind of just have to actually do detective work then.
[26:27.18]Oh, he's not a true sinner.
[26:31.30]Door to Chapel Hall, average.
[26:34.66]Oh shit, I'm becoming the YouTube video.
[26:36.57]Okay, what are we doing over here?
[26:45.16]They all have the same key.
[26:48.19]No, only true sinners.
[26:49.41]Okay, so I have the key now.
[26:54.49]I guess I can open the door that was over there.
[26:58.39]You were always like this.
[27:00.64]Hey, come on, man.
[27:04.90]That's not what a true sinner would say.
[27:06.32]To, like, the Lord of Hatred, which is me.
[27:15.49]Now I'm self-conscious.
[27:16.57]I am.
[27:17.67]Now I have to like think about how I do this.
[27:22.18]I have to be careful.
[27:27.08]I'm like scared to play the game now.
[27:29.42]I actually am scared to play.
[27:34.21]Because I'm going to do that.
[27:35.97]I'm going to do like the elevator joke where the elevator house floats away.
[27:39.41]I'm going to do that.
[27:40.93]Fuck.
[27:45.60]I don't know how to- I don't know how to talk!
[27:48.86]I would have made, like, the cowardly lion joke.
[27:51.98]Oh, no!
[27:55.52]Alright, so what the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[27:58.06]Okay, okay, so what am I supposed to do?
[28:03.56]Okay!
[28:11.30]No, no, I can't let it take me over.
[28:17.24]I need to see it for myself.
[28:18.22]So what's the difference?
[28:19.04]What do I have to... The anvil key... So, okay, hold on, let me just... Yeah, I know I have the key now, but does that... Chapel Hall.
[28:37.61]Oh, okay.
[28:38.09]I thought it was for the other door.
[28:39.49]Uh-oh.
[28:41.65]Oh, there are ghosts!
[28:45.60]No.
[28:47.10]I can't make any jokes.
[28:48.20]What if it's like a YouTuber joke?
[28:53.08]Right?
[28:53.68]I don't think I can say anything.
[28:55.68]I can't hurt these things.
[28:58.34]Oh my god.
[29:01.45]Uh... How... Do I have to pick up a book or something?
[29:11.89]Offering?
[29:13.13]Offering?
[29:17.36]Oh my god, I'm being surrounded.
[29:18.17]Can they hurt me?
[29:18.51]Out of the way.
[29:19.33]We're in different planes of existence.
[29:20.85]They can't hurt me.
[29:21.53]I can't hurt them.
[29:22.87]See?
[29:24.75]Alright.
[29:25.17]Okay, that's fine.
[29:25.81]They can't hurt me.
[29:26.39]They're in a different plane.
[29:27.51]They're in a different reality.
[29:31.05]Yeah, see?
[29:32.10]Let me see here.
[29:38.74]Okay, let me see here.
[29:40.90]Do I have any, like, spells I can cold touch?
[29:49.81]That didn't do anything.
[29:52.95]Shocking touch.
[29:55.55]Absorb Magicka.
[29:57.54]Shocking touch.
[30:02.06]I missed?
[30:02.56]What do you mean I missed?
[30:05.30]I definitely did not miss.
[30:14.22]But you need to touch them.
[30:16.20]I need to touch them.
[30:25.75]I thought it was like just the name of the spell.
[30:27.97]I don't know how to grab their face like a palm their face like a ball Alright, somebody attacked me so I can get free money.
[30:34.39]Oh
[30:39.52]Alright.
[30:40.64]Let's go.
[30:41.02]Alright.
[30:41.44]Which one of you is going to tell me about my past and how I should... What am I going to bah humbug?
[30:45.25]No!
[30:46.03]That's a YouTuber joke.
[30:47.69]I can't.
[30:48.65]I can't.
[30:48.93]I'm so self-conscious now.
[30:50.43]Somebody just attack me.
[30:52.89]Somebody attack me.
[31:05.38]I don't have a silver arrow.
[31:07.05]Okay, wait.
[31:07.45]Can I shoot this?
[31:09.62]Steel Bow, Silver Arrow.
[31:15.42]Alright.
[31:19.18]I don't have any more Silver Arrows.
[31:23.13]Somebody else cast a spell at me.
[31:24.63]Please.
[31:29.75]What was that?
[31:30.39]Can I pick that up?
[31:35.46]Just let the goblin take control.
[31:37.30]Absorb Magicka.
[31:39.63]I can't cast it though.
[31:50.11]Do I have a random spell here?
[31:52.47]Absorb skill, blunt.
[31:53.53]Absorb, blunt, begilding touch, charm, chameleon, fire damage.
[31:59.24]I guess I could do this.
[32:02.34]Let me just put this on 1 or something.
[32:09.26]Got one.
[32:10.70]Ectoplasm.
[32:11.50]That sells for a lot of money.
[32:13.66]Alright, let's get... Oh, no.
[32:18.13]Fuck.
[32:18.65]No, no, no.
[32:19.67]Good.
[32:19.93]Okay.
[32:20.27]Go back to the bottom?
[32:21.07]Yeah.
[32:24.31]Absorb skill.
[32:25.11]Alright.
[32:29.93]Hit me.
[32:33.60]I don't have any silver weapons or anything.
[32:34.90]I guess I could leave and go get one.
[32:39.65]They're almost dead, though.
[32:40.51]There we go.
[32:41.47]I'm sore.
[32:41.87]Did I not get him?
[32:51.21]Wait, the mace?
[32:55.39]Whoa, whoa, the mace!
[32:56.49]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[32:59.17]Why is the mace silver?
[33:00.71]I don't understand.
[33:02.83]It's a blunt one-handed... How is that silver?
[33:06.79]Okay.
[33:07.69]Well, that's good to know.
[33:10.60]Whoa!
[33:13.39]Alright, pretty cool.
[33:14.03]What's my difficulty at?
[33:15.11]Is it normal?
[33:17.09]That's alright.
[33:17.69]It's fine.
[33:21.61]Attack his heart.
[33:24.25]So we gotta open up the other door and cleanse this place.
[33:29.12]Easy enough.
[33:31.12]This has been fully cleansed, right?
[33:32.54]Are there any more people down here that need to be cleansed?
[33:38.35]Use mace.
[33:39.01]Use mace.
[33:39.39]Use mace.
[33:39.69]Use mace.
[33:40.35]Use mace.
[33:40.79]No, it's just the other door.
[33:52.68]Well, um... Chapel Hall.
[34:05.07]Is there anybody else here?
[34:15.12]Interesting.
[34:15.56]Alright, well, I guess maybe I can't do anything in there.
[34:19.69]No, there's no more YouTuber jokes going on.
[34:24.23]Steal food?
[34:25.95]I can't steal food from a chapel, man.
[34:31.27]Just gonna look around.
[34:42.97]said like a tuber okay look around here alright well it really why is it on fire now is it on fire before I feel like the smoke wasn't that intense
[35:13.43]I wouldn't go in there unless you have a strong stomach.
[35:17.39]We have orders to leave everything just the way it was until the investigation into the chapel attack is finished.
[35:23.62]You're paying too much dedication to the sinners.
[35:26.56]Gray Fox.
[35:30.86]Anvil.
[35:31.18]It's baffling how anyone could have gotten in.
[35:34.48]An elephant not being seen by our patrols is beyond me.
[35:39.96]Maybe that prophet is right.
[35:42.38]Some kind of unholy doom visited upon us.
[35:46.32]Doom, okay.
[35:47.42]Can I have directions?
[35:48.32]What are you looking for?
[35:50.88]Where are they?
[35:52.20]The guild's... Okay, so... I'm listening.
[36:00.75]I wish I could say that.
[36:04.77]Is that so?
[36:07.37]Oh, that's... Don't talk such rot.
[36:12.34]Don't try to manipulate me.
[36:21.36]Remarkable.
[36:23.10]That's great!
[36:24.46]You can't scare me.
[36:32.09]Oh, that's great!
[36:33.51]That's really too much.
[36:41.60]Is that so?
[36:44.08]Don't talk such rot.
[36:47.68]I wish I could say that.
[36:49.94]Excellent.
[36:50.48]I got it!
[36:51.42]I did it!
[36:51.99]Alright, let's see what's next.
[37:03.25]I've heard rumors of an attack in the chapel.
[37:04.73]In the anvil, no one seems to know what happened, but all priests and priests were killed in the altar.
[37:09.10]Yeah, what the hell?
[37:11.04]I mean, I... Should I need to ask my... more questions or something?
[37:15.30]Alright, well... Farewell.
[37:37.00]Get out of the way!
[37:37.98]Stop it!
[37:43.19]Six of the day.
[37:45.01]Sure.
[37:46.13]Go down to the chapel and you can't miss him.
[37:48.66]He'll be the one outside, ranting at passersby.

[38:26.86]So we are back in episode 42 of our Let's Play of Oblivion.
[38:34.77]We're listening to this weird guy here, and we're- we're li- fucking god damn it.
[38:41.72]Stupid fucking- stupidest fucking thing ever.
[38:45.24]Fucking god damn it.
[38:49.20]Fucking seriously can't even say a fucking intro.
[38:52.49]It's been like fucking 25 minutes in the same goddamn spot.
[38:55.43]Fucking idiot.
[38:56.64]Get it together, man.
[39:02.36]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[39:03.46]Welcome sinners back to the channel.
[39:05.76]As you see, we're in episode number 42 of Back to Oblivion.
[39:10.22]I have to talk to this guy.
[39:13.33]And then they cut that whole part out.
[39:26.19]This is only the beginning.
[39:29.55]Umaril has returned, as foretold by Pelinal Whitestrake in his dying breath.
[39:38.88]Ooh, who's that?
[39:41.32]Umaril the Unfathered.
[39:43.06]Is this D.O.C.?
[39:43.82]The sorcerer king of the aliens who ruled over this land for long ages before the rise of men.
[39:53.58]He was cast down by Pelinal Whitestrike.
[39:56.80]He looks exactly like Pluto.
[40:00.21]And now he has returned to seek vengeance.
[40:03.11]He does look just like Pluto.
[40:05.19]You're right.
[40:06.23]That's true.
[40:06.77]Alright, who is this man he was speaking of?
[40:10.42]Does no one remember the old tales?
[40:13.42]Saint Pelinal, the divine crusader of legend, Alicia's companion when she overthrew the rule of the Ayleids 3,000 years ago.
[40:25.14]A long time ago.
[40:27.00]Pelinal, with the aid of the gods, fought the Ayleid sorcerer, King Umeril, and slew him.
[40:35.15]But Umeril's spirit survived, and he has now returned.
[40:45.15]Alright, just tell me who attacked the chapel.
[40:46.95]Do you understand nothing?
[40:49.71]The blood speaks.
[40:52.73]I can read the ancient runes if you cannot.
[40:58.14]Don't say that in the mirror.
[41:06.60]By the eternal power of Umaril, the mortal gods shall be cast down.
[41:15.85]A curse upon Umaril's ancient foes.
[41:20.21]And a threat.
[41:22.69]That sounded like when Adam Sandler and Billy Madison did his Shakespeare to win the hearts over of the whole school.
[41:33.02]And it was during the competition with the evil guy.
[41:34.84]That's exactly what he sounds like.
[41:39.32]Umaril cannot be stopped.
[41:42.39]Not without the aid of the gods, not without the Crusader's relics.
[41:48.29]Without a champion, the gods are powerless to act.
[41:54.24]But who among us is worthy to wield the divine Crusader's weaponry?
[42:02.56]I will quest for the relics.
[42:03.70]Okay, this guy's putting on pants that are too tight through the whole conversation.
[42:10.80]You think that you can fight those knights?
[42:12.86]Is it possible?
[42:13.46]Are you sure?
[42:14.02]Let me just get this last button.
[42:15.80]Okay.
[42:30.23]I'm worthy.
[42:30.65]It's time to find the relics.
[42:32.11]I've spoken to the prophet outside Anvil Chapel.
[42:34.49]He claims, allegedly, according to the Surgeon General's warning, smoking, you know, allegedly can cause problems.
[43:00.15]that an ancient, uh, alien sorcerer, his king, has returned from beyond the grave to destroy the church, and that only a true knight wearing the legendary Crusader's relics can possibly defeat him.
[43:11.39]I shall speak to him further to find out how to find those relics.
[43:13.84]That was a different voice.
[43:17.68]Gotta get the weapon and the armor.
[43:28.98]He went alone into the white gold tower, challenged the Iliad sorcerer King Umaril to single combat, and slew him.
[43:38.57]Single fucking combat?
[43:40.65]Alas, Umaril was not truly slain, but only cast beyond the bounds of Nurn.
[43:48.12]And now he has returned to wreak his vengeance upon the gods, as was prophesied by Pelennel himself with his dying breath.
[44:00.01]That's actually Jeff Green.
[44:01.95]Only a true knight, wielding the holy relics of the divine crusader, has a chance to defeat Umarone.
[44:13.03]That's exactly who this is.
[44:17.33]No, it's not actually him, but when he screamed really loud, it was exactly, it was Jeff Green.
[44:21.81]Alright, let's go.
[44:35.63]I am the hero.
[44:38.65]Okay.
[44:39.35]Did we get enough info to find one?
[44:43.07]What did he say?
[44:49.86]He said the... What the hell was the name of the place?
[44:54.38]He said, like, a certain name.
[44:55.20]The tower?
[44:56.56]Something tower?
[44:59.94]Do you have, like, more stuff?
[45:03.70]Oh, there.
[45:03.88]Okay.
[45:04.83]Walk the Pilgrim's Way.
[45:08.23]Gold tower.
[45:08.59]There it is.
[45:33.97]Pray to each of the gods in turn and ask their favor.
[45:39.02]If the gods deem you worthy, you will be granted a sign.
[45:43.80]Alright.
[45:47.18]Walking the pilgrims, follow the map I gave you.
[45:50.68]Visit the Way Shrines of the Nine.
[45:53.49]Alright.
[45:57.43]Now, I've spoken to Vasturia.
[45:58.89]He told me that in order to seek the relics of the Crusader, I must first do a pilgrimage to the Way Shrines of the Divines.
[46:04.77]That's a great alternative rock band name.
[46:08.85]He gave me a map of the pilgrim's way to help me locate the shrines.
[46:12.28]Once I visited a way shrine for each of the nine divines, I may receive a vision if I'm judged a worthy knight.
[46:21.14]Okay.
[46:23.63]Where is the first way shrine?
[46:28.35]The gold tower.
[46:31.75]Or is that just everywhere?
[46:35.54]There's an item somewhere.
[46:42.72]What is it?
[46:45.00]Bloodstained note!
[46:46.20]Don't scroll, Jeremy!
[46:47.56]Uh, the warp in the west.
[46:52.46]Way, shrines, map.
[46:54.15]Oh lord, okay.
[46:55.65]The pilgrim's way.
[46:56.59]This is gonna take like seven hours!
[47:00.63]If you wish to repent your sins and re-advocate your life to the gods, pray at the Waystrands of the Nine.
[47:06.97]May the Nine hear your prayers.
[47:10.31]So, there's one here in Arkay.
[47:16.62]Where are we right now?
[47:24.72]Can I get a bigger map?
[47:28.65]I wish I could scroll out of here, because I can't.
[47:42.13]So there's one here.
[47:42.97]I don't even know where I am.
[47:48.11]So it's just there.
[47:49.07]We're going to have to do this at the same time.
[47:52.82]Let's do another quest.
[47:55.36]Because that's going to take a long time.
[47:58.24]GeoGuessr Alright, let's get let's do another one because that's gonna be that's a that's like a whole game scenario If I was locations or the Dwarven artifacts a door in the bay I've heard a rumor that a strange doorways appeared on a small island I should investigate Alright Bay Rhone stables, let's just go here
[48:27.40]Door in the middle of an island.
[48:32.40]Let's check it out.
[48:42.49]There it is.
[48:42.89]There's going to be a witch in here.
[48:45.91]And she's going to switch mugs on me.
[48:47.51]She's going to put poison in a mug.
[48:48.75]And she's going to be like, Which one will you drink from?
[48:51.97]I made a tea for the two of us.
[48:55.47]Drink it.
[48:56.90]And I'm gonna switch the mugs on her.
[49:04.12]Can he go in the water?
[49:06.30]Can the horse swim?
[49:08.04]Oh, that's cool.
[49:08.52]The horse can actually swim.
[49:15.01]We're kind of just floating.
[49:22.61]This is probably really relaxing for the horse.
[49:28.97]You know?
[49:31.71]You know what I wish they would make?
[49:32.81]Do they make them?
[49:36.27]I wish there was a back massage machine for horses.
[49:40.50]The device that they just kind of stand there and these two knobs just run up and down their back.
[49:46.70]It deserves it.
[49:47.76]After all the work that they do here, you know?
[49:55.07]Don't do this.
[49:55.83]Don't do it.
[49:56.39]Stop doing this.
[49:57.23]And stop it.
[49:57.67]What are you talking about?
[49:59.19]This is a big, big DLC.
[50:08.85]Hard DLC.
[50:12.20]Well, here.
[50:13.16]I'll take... I'll... Taken care of.
[50:15.96]If I walk in here and it's like, I don't...
[50:30.10]I thought it was a portal.
[50:30.94]It's not a door.
[50:38.48]Chat is leading him astray.
[50:40.42]Is that what they're doing?
[50:44.64]This is the biggest DLC in the history of gaming.
[50:48.06]I thought it was just a house.
[50:49.29]I have to, like, go in a secret door.
[50:50.85]There's, like, an old woman in there that's gonna switch the cups and the poison, and one of us is gonna drink the poison, and you switch it on her, and then she turns into a bat or something.
[50:58.16]You're telling me this is, like, fucking 20 hours?
[51:02.60]How long is this gonna take?
[51:11.84]More than 20.
[51:12.58]It took me 30 hours to wait.
[51:15.18]Let me just see it.
[51:27.71]Let's just walk in together and we'll find it.
[51:30.00]I want to see it.
[51:31.62]The way you guys are describing this, I'm going to open this door and we're going to look up and there's going to be like fucking missiles flying around.
[51:38.36]And like demons and aliens all eating each other and stuff.
[51:40.72]I have to see it.
[51:50.89]Who's gonna win?
[51:51.77]They both have equal amounts of health.
[52:25.95]Who the fuck is this random cat person?
[52:28.11]Why is it just a random like furry guy here?
[52:30.19]This is like a guy in like, I'm just an anthropomorphic dude.
[52:33.37]Oh.
[52:58.16]Alright, let's go in.
[53:00.60]The door will not open to you?
[53:06.82]I can't go in here.
[53:11.61]A nice effort, though.
[53:13.13]Shame he's dead.
[53:13.85]Heh, these things happen.
[53:20.73]Bring me a champion.
[53:22.82]Rend the flesh of my foes.
[53:24.58]Can I prove?
[53:25.42]This guy's listening, too.
[53:28.58]Holy shit.
[53:29.44]Am I the champion?
[53:32.12]Right now, both of us, I mean, we can't hear each other's internal monologues.
[53:35.47]Really?
[53:35.75]Do come in.
[53:37.09]It's lovely in the aisles right now.
[53:38.79]He's also playing with him.
[53:43.63]By the gods, there's a psychopath on the loose.
[53:46.43]Shit.
[53:48.35]A psychopath!
[53:50.03]Where is the random, like, Garfield furry going?
[53:58.70]Stop!
[54:17.71]Stop!
[54:19.76]Stop it!
[54:31.44]I can't even go in here.
[54:32.64]Why'd you guys tell me to do this?
[54:43.95]Yes, you can.
[54:46.87]The door just told me I can't go in there.
[54:53.03]Did I just lose patience and shoot a guy?
[54:55.43]With an arrow?
[54:59.31]You have to wait for the dialog.
[55:04.46]Why is that guy here?
[55:06.56]That guy's only here for you to shoot with arrows.
[55:08.76]What else is he there for?
[55:13.80]They got guy in armor waiting at the door to be judged of a guy in a t-shirt and jeans What would you be doing up at this door?
[55:34.19]He could have asked him?
[55:38.15]I could have, yeah
[55:46.86]I guess.
[55:51.29]You need to get the ant.
[55:52.19]Alright.
[55:52.43]Well, I'm not going to attack anybody.
[55:53.61]Let's save it right here just in case something else goes horribly wrong.
[56:02.65]Alright.
[56:05.99]Be there.
[56:06.35]Good boy.
[56:07.40]Good boy.
[56:17.81]I didn't even change the iodine file.
[56:18.93]Alright, here we go.
[56:19.65]He doesn't have anything.
[56:21.64]Got him.
[56:21.86]Nothing that's gone in has come out right.
[56:47.49]Okay, strange door.
[56:49.11]How does he die to Pinwheel?
[56:50.61]I didn't die to Pinwheel.
[56:52.87]That is the definition.
[56:53.89]You are falling for the fake news.
[56:55.53]I didn't die to Pinwheel.
[56:57.09]That is like, that is the epitome.
[57:17.29]I killed Pinwheel on my first try.
[57:19.76]It isn't fake.
[57:21.36]The thing is, we've got facts and evidence.
[57:23.48]That whole stream is backed up.
[57:25.02]You can watch the whole thing from start to finish.
[57:28.90]Fake news.
[57:29.56]I'm going in.
[57:31.46]The doc deleted the bot.
[57:34.20]I did not.
[57:34.62]Alright, let's talk to this person then.
[57:57.32]You guys want me to talk?
[57:58.12]Pay attention to this.
[58:00.06]Mhm.
[58:19.84]What else?
[58:20.85]Bring me a champion.
[58:22.91]Rend the flesh of my foes.
[58:25.53]A mortal champion to wade through the entrails of my enemies.
[58:33.77]Really?
[58:34.79]Do come in.
[58:36.13]It's lovely in the aisles right now.
[58:37.94]Perfect time for a visit.
[59:00.44]Please, have a seat.
[59:03.48]Please, sit.
[59:32.29]Alright, let's do it.
[59:37.16]I'm excited.
[59:40.44]I saved it before.
[59:41.12]I'm good.
[59:44.96]Yes, what can I do for you?
[59:46.98]I imagine you're here about the door.
[59:49.44]Yes, strange door.
[59:51.22]Yes, you have entered and now you are here.
[59:55.02]Amazing.
[59:56.81]Truly amazing.
[59:58.83]Who are you?
[59:59.43]What is this?
[59:59.97]Let's just get rid of the chase.
[60:01.27]What the hell?
[60:01.79]Where are we here?
[60:02.67]You approach the Shivering Isles.
[60:04.87]Through the door behind me lies the realm of Sheogorath, Prince of Madness, Lord of the Never There.
[60:14.75]Would you like some tea?
[60:18.02]Yes, I would like some tea.
[60:19.44]Okay.
[60:19.84]And he stands up and you hear a bunch of pouring and weird sounds and he's like, his back is turned.
[60:23.46]I'm waiting for it.
[60:24.48]I am Haskell, Chamberlain to the Lord Sheogorath.
[60:30.75]Why did this door appear?
[60:31.65]And what is that?
[60:49.28]For you?
[60:49.80]I do not know.
[60:52.56]My lord seeks a mortal to act as his champion.
[60:56.31]As for his intent, to attempt to fathom it is a foolish endeavor.
[61:02.43]His will is his own.
[61:04.51]His reality follows suit.
[61:06.96]You are here because you chose to enter.
[61:09.50]You were not summoned.
[61:12.18]You have the ugliest shirt I've ever seen on another human being in my entire life.
[61:17.56]take that off get rid of that you look awful just put on a fucking just a polo shirt or something dude they entered this realm and were ill prepared their minds are now the property of my lord dude like you look like a goddamn piranha plant here like give me a break
[61:42.23]Well, what happens now?
[61:43.63]Now?
[62:03.24]Or you may continue onward through the door behind me.
[62:07.50]If you can pass the gates of madness, perhaps the Lord Sheogorath will find a use for you.
[62:14.90]And if I go through the door?
[62:16.10]Who is to say?
[62:17.81]There are always choices to be made.
[62:20.35]The realm of madness is no different in that regard.
[62:23.75]Your choices are your own.
[62:26.51]I want that book.
[62:27.05]It's legal to take that book.
[62:28.41]Okay, wait, I can't move.
[62:29.03]I'm sitting.
[62:56.30]Okay, so it's saved here.
[62:58.40]Yes?
[62:59.19]What is it you want?
[63:01.31]I can't just bypass him?
[63:05.57]Let's be civil, shall we?
[63:07.91]Please, have a seat.
[63:10.15]Stop stalling.
[63:11.21]Okay, guys, so what... Oh, let's climb up the chair for a second here.
[63:14.01]Let's get this video a little bit longer than we thought.
[63:16.60]Let's be civil, shall we?
[63:18.50]Please, have a seat.
[63:22.16]No, I'm gonna be self-conscious forever.
[63:26.23]Let's go.
[63:28.11]I'll do it.
[63:29.01]Fine.
[63:29.97]I'm sure my lord will be most pleased.
[63:32.37]You'll want to pass through the gates of madness.
[63:34.79]Oh, and mind the gatekeeper.
[63:37.29]He dislikes strangers to the realm.
[63:39.09]Okay.
[63:40.70]Enjoy your stay.
[63:43.54]A door in Niben Bay.
[63:46.02]Alright, now stand up.
[64:00.67]Reality is often disappointing.
[64:19.17]This is cool.
[64:20.89]Ah!
[64:21.53]You've entered the Shivering Isles.
[64:22.53]In order to find the Lord of this realm, I must first pass through the Gates of Madness.
[64:28.93]Mushrooms.
[64:32.09]This is cool.
[64:36.56]Alright, hold on.
[64:37.32]Important.
[64:37.80]I... No, stop it.
[64:43.24]This is not going in the video.
[64:45.56]Now we can start.
[64:49.34]Straight ahead.
[64:54.90]Your athletic skill has increased.
[64:56.20]Good.
[64:56.52]Monster?
[64:58.51]Monster?
[65:01.33]Monster!
[65:02.75]It's like a sea person.
[65:03.83]I just killed Thanos.
[65:12.10]There he was.
[65:12.54]It was him!
[65:20.62]It was easy!
[65:25.47]What was that?
[65:27.13]Is it alive?
[65:27.69]No.
[65:33.66]Ooh, a grumite dagger.
[65:35.82]There's stuff to look at over here, though.
[65:46.87]No, but who cares?
[65:54.21]Found blister pod cap.
[65:55.11]I need to start doing alchemy or something.
[65:57.47]Should I?
[65:57.95]I did not.
[65:59.03]Am I too young for this?
[66:01.60]Do I need a parent in the room for this?
[66:03.00]Seriously?
[66:03.58]Like, should I actually be here?
[66:04.66]This is cool, but I mean, I think the game requires me to be like an adult here.
[66:10.20]I'm only two years old.
[66:17.82]Is my horse here?
[66:23.24]You have us.
[66:24.18]That's true.
[66:28.75]I mean, for somebody that does not even know how to make a potion, should I be in this DLC?
[66:36.73]Congealed putrescine.
[66:42.47]What is that?
[66:43.05]Is that a gargoyle thing?
[66:44.58]Or is that a monster?
[66:45.60]I don't think it's going to get up.
[67:05.77]Come on.
[67:06.99]I don't want to go swimming.
[67:07.71]No, it looks like we're going to have to.
[67:12.75]No, we're not.
[67:22.02]We found Passwall.
[67:26.14]Let me just take a look and see what the actual mission is.
[67:28.70]I've entered the Shivering Owls.
[67:30.40]I must first pass through the Gates of Madness.
[67:32.20]I kind of did that.
[67:39.05]I mean, like, do people live here?
[67:41.73]Why would you live here?
[67:47.41]This person lives here.
[67:48.27]Hello, I'm Nanette Dawn.
[67:53.70]I wasn't sure why I came here until she showed up.
[67:56.86]Now I know.
[67:58.20]I'm going to be a powerful sorceress, just like Realmina.
[68:04.21]Do you hear that sound?
[68:06.33]It's like a horse dying.
[68:07.89]So you move to the demon Hollywood to be a sorceress entertainer.
[68:12.70]This is the best place for you to go to learn to be a sorceress or something, right?
[68:19.80]Can't get in without Sheogorath's blessing.
[68:23.32]She can hear the sub sounds.
[68:25.22]That's the reason we're all waiting here.
[68:27.64]The Sheogorath's blessing.
[68:30.67]Oh, and I guess there's keys sewn up inside the gatekeeper's body.
[68:35.71]Not sure why someone would do that.
[68:38.29]It's not like anyone forget them now.
[68:43.65]He's the crowning achievement of Relmina Verinum.
[68:47.87]She's my teacher.
[68:49.76]The gatekeeper keeps out people who don't belong.
[68:53.85]I saw some strangers heading up there earlier.
[68:57.18]If they're still alive, you can see the gatekeeper in action.
[69:01.14]It's glorious.
[69:02.34]Alright.
[69:05.92]Here we go.
[69:06.40]Say what you're going to say.
[69:07.66]I can't.
[69:10.87]I can't.
[69:11.33]Oh, yeah.
[69:11.79]Here we go.
[69:12.19]Let's see.
[69:17.95]I doubt it.
[69:20.74]Not bad.
[69:21.40]Not bad at all.
[69:24.36]whatever you want not now not later not ever okay that's not bad I mean no I did it I'm fine I just went up like 10 points I don't know who built it it was here before any of us arrived it looks like other people lived here before
[69:51.64]Dreadwin's been selling what they left behind.
[69:54.96]So if you need something, talk to her.
[69:57.58]It really isn't, though.
[69:58.50]She's in the Wastrel's purse.
[70:00.12]It's like, it's easy, but it's like dumb, you know?
[70:03.36]I don't want to know about the Wanderers.
[70:09.16]Well, let's hear them.
[70:09.94]Felmore must be a terrible place to live.
[70:14.00]Let me show you.
[70:15.26]Goodbye.
[70:16.04]Alright, so we got some people up here.
[70:19.20]We have a whole house of stuff to steal from, so that's good.
[70:24.50]Where's your ceremonial giant base that has 10 damage on it?
[70:28.58]Oh, there's the jewelry case.
[70:29.70]That's what we came in for.
[70:31.40]It actually is the jewelry box.
[70:50.96]What about upstairs?
[70:55.74]Wooden door to the fringe.
[71:02.96]Oh, this shit sucks.
[71:05.24]Whoa.
[71:10.33]I want to go with the actual front door.
[71:18.56]So he's going to go up the road and find the gatekeeper.
[71:23.50]Maybe he will make it so my FOV stays at 90.
[71:26.56]But that's my fault because I need to make the INI file there.
[71:29.16]And that's my fault for doing that.
[71:31.04]Not doing it.
[71:34.46]What's this?
[71:35.94]Is this a shop?
[71:40.51]People... This commerce in hell.
[71:46.05]Hello, I'm Dreadwyn.
[71:49.05]No one was running this place when I got here.
[71:51.09]I guess, like, how do you... If you live in Hell, how are you gonna eat?
[71:53.17]We left plenty of things behind, though.
[71:56.25]What do you need?
[71:57.51]You need to have some kind of currency to buy the mealworms and eat them.
[72:04.56]I figured that every meal in Hell is mealworms and hot sauce.
[72:09.22]After a while, it's not going to be that terrible.
[72:15.81]He protects the gates of madness.
[72:18.60]He'll kill anyone who gets near.
[72:21.60]He's about to destroy some adventurers up there now.
[72:24.56]Okay.
[72:27.56]Well, let's see.
[72:28.42]What do you got?
[72:30.04]Fine iron bow, iron warhammer.
[72:32.46]Five damage.
[72:33.36]What do I got right now?
[72:36.75]Some lace.
[72:37.31]How much is that?
[72:41.17]I already had one of these, didn't I?
[72:51.08]Open easy lock.
[72:52.40]Beer pelt.
[72:55.62]Beer.
[72:57.31]Wine.
[72:59.49]No, I'll just stick with this mace that I have.
[73:01.31]Whatever.
[73:03.91]That's too much money.
[73:04.67]I can just take it from him.
[73:09.37]You know what I'm saying?
[73:10.40]Why ever... Money... Look, there it is right here.
[73:13.16]It's gonna be, like, on the table.
[73:15.64]There it is.
[73:15.96]Alright, this... Oh, shit.
[73:18.74]Okay.
[73:18.86]Okay.
[73:19.81]You've got nice bones.
[73:22.55]Yeah, whatever, you fucking demon.
[73:27.53]Alright, there's the weapon.
[73:28.47]Just gotta get that.
[73:29.15]Nah, I can't get that now with this, like, demon sentry down here.
[73:35.57]See, look, they're even eating fucking people.
[73:37.15]Look at this.
[73:38.23]They're eating dinosaurs and weird shit.
[73:39.81]There's, like, demon legs.
[73:41.11]Who knows?
[73:42.57]That's probably some demon.
[73:43.57]Alright, that's a demon deity.
[73:47.85]That's Satan here.
[73:49.28]There he is.
[73:50.97]They all pray to Satan down here.
[73:56.61]This better be good or you'll regret it.
[73:58.39]See?
[74:00.88]Probably a demon lives in there.
[74:01.90]I don't know if I want to steal from a demon's bed.
[74:19.09]If you think I'm interested in whatever you're selling me, I'm not.
[74:23.50]Why don't you go play with the gatekeeper?
[74:26.44]Run along now.
[74:31.98]One leads to mania.
[74:33.92]One to dementia.
[74:35.74]Two shades of madness.
[74:38.45]You're not getting in because you're not blessed by Shayagora.
[74:43.51]You can try to get the keys.
[74:44.92]Sewn into your child's body.
[74:46.80]My lord had them sewn into my child's body.
[74:49.38]So this is your son.
[74:50.62]I wonder if you're a fast bleeder or a slow bleeder.
[74:54.40]So what I should do is I should just grab you and do like the, I got a hostage, right?
[74:59.12]And like walk up to the gate and be like, hold the mace up, right?
[75:03.38]So it'd be like, you give me that key right now or, you know, that's the way to do it, I think.
[75:13.72]Nothing has to happen.
[75:22.06]Okay, we'll call him on the phone right now.
[75:26.71]And say, hey son, I need you to give me that key.
[75:29.37]You need to get it out of your body right now.
[75:31.37]Go to the surgeon, go to the local... Get the sutures removed.
[75:35.59]Or the guy standing in front of me is going to hit me in the face with a mace.
[75:42.91]Didn't think this one through.
[75:53.12]Look at this.
[75:54.00]Revolting.
[75:56.86]Absolutely revolting.
[75:58.82]Disgusting.
[75:59.38]You just got meat up on the counter here.
[76:03.10]Not even in a bag, not even been plastic wrapped.
[76:07.08]Absolutely disgusting.
[76:09.02]Revolting.
[76:10.36]Demon.
[76:15.66]Disgusting.
[76:16.70]Yeah, even like Satan himself.
[76:18.47]Like fucking lettuce just hanging around here.
[76:20.55]Disgusting.
[76:22.01]Revolting.
[76:23.61]Demon.
[76:24.25]Revolting.
[76:28.81]Disgusting.
[76:29.81]Alright, let's go.
[76:37.92]That's gonna fuck me up every time.
[76:43.04]Is this a YouTuber joke?
[76:44.24]No.
[76:44.48]No.
[76:47.20]I want to see who this person is, because I want to see if I can take him.
[76:52.82]Like, I've got a demon weapon.
[76:53.92]That means it's anti-demon, right?
[76:58.16]That's your son?
[76:58.80]Alright.
[77:15.88]I'm Felus Sarandus.
[77:17.80]Don't breathe on me.
[77:21.88]He's pretty scary, isn't he?
[77:24.17]Let's watch him in action.
[77:27.93]Alright, let's watch him.
[77:28.73]They should have listened to me.
[77:30.61]Hello, I'm Sheldon.
[77:32.13]Sheldon?
[77:32.67]I've been here the longest.
[77:34.39]That's why I'm mayor of Passwall.
[77:37.21]That, and because I'm the best at being in charge.
[77:41.53]Welcome to my town.
[77:43.75]Hey, alright, we got some options here.
[77:46.96]Gates of Madness.
[77:47.86]They say the keys are sewn up in the gatekeeper's body.
[77:51.32]Basically, that means you're not getting in.
[77:56.48]He guards the Gates of Madness.
[77:58.40]See for yourself.
[77:58.90]He's about to destroy a party of adventurers.
[78:03.35]Alright.
[78:03.79]So I just have to stick my mace onto his backside and just stuff it in there.
[78:07.79]How do you know about this?

[78:38.15]Disgusting demon.
[78:40.19]The formidable gatekeeper has destroyed a party of adventurers.
[78:42.53]I should talk to the residents of Passport before trying to deal with this creature.
[78:46.79]Alright, let's... I thought I could talk to him.
[78:52.60]I can't, like, talk to him.

[85:45.61]Thanks a lot, stupid.
[85:48.07]I will never trust you with a secret.
[85:53.13]Uh, so.
[85:56.01]Mm-mm-mm.
[85:57.94]Mm-mm-mm!
[86:02.87]I got something for you to take.
[86:06.89]I'd like to sell you.
[86:09.19]This is $240.
[86:12.35]Is it worth me getting rid of this?
[86:15.43]Or should I just put this back on?
[86:21.83]Yes.
[86:22.99]Okay.
[86:32.42]He only has $300.
[86:33.28]Let's try to get all of his money.
[86:37.00]Offer refused.
[86:44.23]Still took his money.
[86:48.99]What else we got?
[86:53.91]We got a bunch of fucking dumb shit.
[86:58.00]Yeah, you want a torch?
[87:00.28]Take three of them.

[87:43.12]I should sell something.
[87:45.07]I should sell these.
[87:49.21]I want them, though.
[87:55.65]What if, like, I need them at some point?
[87:59.37]I can't get rid of that.
[88:00.17]What if I need to use it later on?
[88:05.76]They weigh four pounds.
[88:07.02]I think it's worth it.
[88:08.38]They have sentimental value!
[88:09.47]That's why my first item I ever picked up was a rake.
[88:12.19]I'm not gonna get rid of it.
[88:15.45]One is for use, and if I ever need to get rid of it, and the other one is there forever.
[88:20.45]Yeah, I'll get rid of the knives.
[88:32.82]You wanna have at least three rakes by the end of the game.
[88:41.94]Can I get him back?
[88:42.52]I have a lot of these.
[88:54.37]Four of them.
[88:57.29]Cheap wine to sell it.
[88:59.47]Potion of illness.
[89:00.29]I don't want this shit.
[89:01.25]Wait, does he not even have enough money to pay me?
[89:06.08]He only has 300 bucks.
[89:06.66]I don't understand.
[89:07.32]He has $300. $300.
[89:19.36]It's infinite.
[89:19.92]Max cell is 300.
[89:21.38]Okay.
[89:25.64]So, I got the mace still.
[89:27.48]Okay.
[89:28.40]Okay.
[89:29.08]Let's take a look at what else we got.
[89:30.52]Armor.
[89:30.80]That's good.
[89:31.48]Weapons.
[89:31.88]I mean, I could just sell some of these arrows to you.
[89:38.11]I'm gonna sell 20 arrows.
[89:41.61]Keep the bow.
[89:43.91]Uh, blister pod.
[89:45.07]Crap.
[89:48.74]I'm going to keep the hearts.
[89:50.78]Get rid of these.
[89:54.66]I don't want to get rid of the potato.
[89:56.55]I might need it one day.
[89:59.29]Wheat grain.
[89:59.85]Just get rid of all of it.
[90:00.91]I'm not going to even do alchemy.
[90:02.49]I'm too deep.
[90:04.23]You know what I mean?
[90:06.13]Ten minute YouTube video.
[90:08.15]Chameleon.
[90:11.30]I took alchemy.
[90:12.08]I picked alchemy.
[90:20.99]That's alright, we're good.
[90:24.69]He protects the gates of madness.
[90:27.51]He'll kill anyone who gets near.
[90:29.82]I've got a degree in alchemy, but I've never used it.
[90:33.44]She's staying upstairs right now.
[90:39.78]Yep.
[90:40.74]I feel like I need to be on the other side.
[90:45.52]Okay, well... Go ahead.
[90:50.73]You love that.
[90:51.55]I accept, I have no choice.
[90:59.60]Don't be silly.
[91:03.84]Sure, don't make me laugh.
[91:05.96]Alright, we got, we gained, we gained?
[91:08.68]Coerce is better, okay, let's do that one.
[91:11.24]Don't make me laugh.
[91:12.30]Coerce is the best one.
[91:13.96]Don't, please, I'm sorry.
[91:18.61]Good one.
[91:19.17]Shit!
[91:20.59]Well, isn't that sweet of you?
[91:23.99]Was that supposed... That works for me.
[91:29.62]He protects the gates of madness.
[91:32.98]I know how it works.
[91:34.02]I just hate it.
[91:36.06]I just don't... I don't like doing it, but I have to do it.
[91:39.58]I got it.
[91:39.92]I got it.
[91:44.34]Don't worry.
[91:44.64]I hope I'm not dreaming.
[91:48.75]So I just got a new update here.
[91:51.48]Talk to her about the gatekeeper.
[91:52.82]Well, alright, let's do it.
[91:56.44]I didn't fail it, I'm just not doing it perfect every time.
[91:59.00]I already did this.
[91:59.62]Okay, well I can't even do it on her.
[92:09.08]The gatekeeper is my child.
[92:11.90]The consummation of Sheogorath's wisdom in the womb of my genius.
[92:17.54]Shut up.
[92:18.46]His brothers were... You won't bother those blessed by Lord Sheogorath.
[92:24.12]You, however, will die trying to get the keys from my child.
[92:29.13]What if I... Can I just steal them?
[92:32.15]What if I just lie to her?
[92:33.73]You?
[92:34.57]Ha!
[92:35.75]No, you have a conventional type of soul.
[92:39.73]But I don't make that decision.
[92:41.85]The Shivering Isles belong to Lord Shaogorath.
[92:45.01]Lord Shaogorath is gonna end up, he's gonna be a mouse or something, right?
[92:48.79]I'd cut you open and show you just how uninspired your blood is.
[92:53.21]He's gonna be four inches tall on a table.
[92:55.51]No, you won't be getting in.
[92:59.60]No, my secret!
[93:05.27]He's gonna fly away, he's gonna get sucked in a portal.
[93:12.10]Try him if you like.
[93:14.40]Believe me, after you die, I can put your flesh and bones to very good use.
[93:22.72]I'm bored with you.
[93:24.32]Why don't you talk to Nanette?
[93:26.10]She likes... There's one sure way to stop a tongue from flapping.
[93:29.55]Alright, we have to have... Nanette has to tell us, probably.
[93:34.38]So let's just go give Nanette some money.
[93:36.10]Because I don't even want to do the minigame.
[93:37.84]It's just so beneath me.
[93:39.92]Hi.
[93:47.41]Hi.
[93:48.43]Hello.
[93:48.77]Go ahead.
[94:04.42]She's not, like, super happy about any of this shit.
[94:06.92]Don't, please.
[94:07.96]I'm sorry.
[94:08.78]Then she's angry about that.
[94:10.05]Let's pull this down.
[94:11.01]Not now, not later, not ever.
[94:12.31]What does she think about this?
[94:13.27]She's neutral.
[94:15.39]I doubt it.
[94:15.91]Oh, fucking God.
[94:16.63]I hate this so much.
[94:17.71]Good one.
[94:18.31]We can't do better than that.
[94:21.15]I've been dying to tell someone.
[94:23.72]You seem trustworthy enough, but don't tell Romina I said anything.
[94:29.92]The gatekeeper is flawed.
[94:32.16]Her tears hurt him.
[94:37.26]Her tears somehow agitate the Daedra bound to the gatekeeper's body.
[94:42.02]Her tears make it really restless.
[94:44.26]It screams harder against the warding magic.
[94:49.27]She may seem like a tough woman, but the gatekeeper makes her all weepy.
[94:54.69]Go, see for yourself.
[94:56.78]She visits him every night around his bed.
[95:01.71]Just don't tell her I said anything.
[95:04.37]I might get another lesson in the nature of pain.
[95:06.81]I don't like those lessons very much.
[95:11.13]Fuck bartering.
[95:11.87]I never did it either.
[95:15.55]It's just like... It's so unnecessary to me that my brain doesn't want me to do it.
[95:20.63]So I'm just like, how do I do this?
[95:22.27]I don't care.
[95:22.69]Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
[95:28.85]That's what goes through my mind.
[95:29.85]Alright, so we've got some info here.
[95:36.07]I should find Relmia at midnight and spy on her visit with the Gatekeeper.
[95:40.34]What time is it right now?
[95:41.14]It's 5.10 PM.
[95:46.40]So her visit with the Gatekeeper is going to be... She just goes and hangs out with him.
[95:52.98]So I'm just going to follow her.
[95:54.16]Okay, so let's wait.
[95:55.16]It's 5.
[95:55.30]Let's wait until, like, 6 hours.
[96:00.12]Is a minute a second in this game?
[96:05.17]Pretty much.
[96:16.04]What did I do?
[96:16.60]What did I do?
[96:17.30]No!
[96:18.26]What the fuck did I just do?
[96:20.14]Wait.
[96:21.32]Fucking god damn it.
[96:24.05]What?
[96:25.17]I just clicked a button.
[96:26.99]Oh, this fucking mini game.
[96:34.16]I'm just like, my mind is just elsewhere.
[96:36.84]It was supposed to be five hours, six hours.
[96:40.40]What did I do, seven or eight?
[96:47.03]I should be able to sleep in a goddamn bed.
[96:57.84]Okay.
[96:59.64]1020.
[97:00.04]One more hour.
[97:04.19]Let's just hang out.
[97:16.63]Does it matter if I'm here?
[97:17.51]I'm kind of just... I'm actually spying on her.
[97:29.54]She's not going to turn around and be like, hey.
[97:31.20]Actually, hold on.
[97:31.90]Save this shit.
[97:39.82]She can see me.
[97:40.50]She can hear me.
[97:50.01]She's going to go...
[97:57.86]And I'm going to dive and slide down the bowling alley in the comedy movie with a jar in my hand.
[98:02.96]I'm going to get the tear.
[98:04.01]It's going to just barely slow-mo fall in the cup.
[98:12.46]Bad view.
[98:15.68]They can see me though.
[98:32.18]I'm gonna show you the thing that hurt you.
[98:44.33]I'm gonna show you the plot device.
[98:48.35]The sorceress has dropped a handkerchief full of her tears, which apparently can hurt the gatekeeper.
[98:52.07]I should get that handkerchief.
[98:56.19]Is he sleeping?
[98:58.85]Where did she drop it?
[99:00.77]Like, right here?
[99:01.31]I got it.
[99:08.20]I've squeezed the handkerchief full of the sorcerer's tears into a bottle.
[99:10.60]This may act as a poison to the gatekeeper.
[99:12.20]I have a limited number of doses, so I'll need to be careful using them.
[99:25.12]Holy shit, he's coming down the stairs!
[99:29.08]Okay.
[99:30.02]You passed your AI pathing zone.
[99:33.36]Alright, so.
[99:35.51]What the hell am I supposed to do with this?
[99:40.03]So.
[99:41.55]Let me see.
[99:42.29]Is this like a grenade?
[99:43.13]Do I throw a grenade at this guy?
[99:46.72]Harm the gatekeeper for 120 seconds.
[99:54.28]Oh, you coat the mace.
[99:58.78]Interesting.
[100:03.40]I can't just whip it at his head?
[100:09.87]I want to do this during daylight.
[100:10.91]What time is it right now?
[100:18.68]It's 1230.
[100:19.00]Let's do this at like in the morning, right?
[100:22.10]Give him one more night's rest.
[100:28.54]Okay, so what do we got here?
[100:30.54]The mace.
[100:32.79]So I'm not even going to attack him.
[100:35.19]I'm going to poison the arrows, right?
[100:38.19]That would be the smart thing to do.
[100:40.65]Poison your next shot with the steel bow.
[100:42.63]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[100:43.65]Not yet.
[100:45.54]Save.
[100:48.36]We got a save point here.
[100:51.96]Alright.
[101:01.62]What does that do?
[101:04.52]Huh?
[101:05.70]Does he hurt?
[101:13.26]I didn't even hurt him.
[101:20.28]So... So I... Okay, I... Alright.
[101:24.74]When I read that, I thought it was like a dot that lasted like two... But then again, why would it do that?
[101:29.86]So now I can hurt him.
[101:52.79]I wanted to come back up here.
[101:59.39]What's the difficulty?
[102:00.03]The difficulty's on normal.
[102:01.71]The gatekeeper's dead.
[102:02.49]I should retrieve the keys to the Gates of Madness from the gatekeeper's corpse.
[102:07.73]Key to dementia, key to mania, and an iron arrow.
[102:12.91]Got it.
[102:15.65]I'm telling normal.
[102:17.45]Increase the difficulty?
[102:18.61]I can go through either door.
[102:23.42]Whoa!
[102:26.10]So, you've managed to kill the gatekeeper.
[102:29.42]Pity.
[102:30.42]Well, you'll now be able to enter the realm proper.
[102:33.39]You'll notice there are two doors.
[102:36.60]Two doors.
[102:37.18]Don't disappoint him.
[102:38.36]Dementia or mania?
[102:58.65]Tell me about them.
[102:59.35]Do a pulp?
[102:59.65]We'll do a pulp of this.
[103:00.47]Okay.
[103:23.72]The lands of Mania are bright, vibrant, and full of color.
[103:27.67]Oh, that's cool.
[103:28.19]You'll find its inhabitants reflect the land itself.
[103:30.79]It's happy land.
[103:31.99]If you wish to meet the residents of Mania, you will find them in the settlements of Hale and Highcross.
[103:38.08]Take care, then.
[103:39.06]WrestleMania.
[103:40.82]Though the citizens and creatures of Mania are colorful, they can often be quite deadly.
[103:46.06]I'm sure you can handle it, though.
[103:47.84]Okay.
[103:49.08]One of them's crazy town, the other one's happy world.
[103:53.57]Alright.
[103:55.39]Uh, so we... So which one is which?
[104:02.00]Oh, he's gone.
[104:02.92]Well, bye.
[104:06.26]No, that's all.
[104:09.54]Alright, so, um... Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything on any of these corpses.
[104:16.43]Steel warhammers, steel boots, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[104:22.29]It's just a long sword.
[104:23.45]I could pick the Warhammer up.
[104:26.57]No, there's no reason to.
[104:27.59]I'll get a better weapon soon enough.
[104:28.58]Alright.
[104:31.32]So which one is it?
[104:33.06]Is this one... What door is this one?
[104:34.84]It's not labeled.
[104:36.16]Clearly label the doors, please.
[104:45.94]There's no label.
[104:46.86]Alright, Gates of Madness.
[104:48.10]Okay, this is Madness.
[104:49.68]Wait, what?
[104:51.36]Mania, Gates of Madness.
[104:53.08]This is Mania.
[104:55.58]And the other one is Dementia.
[104:58.20]So, I'm going to take a piss.
[105:01.16]And you guys can decide on this.
[105:03.52]Make sure this is correctly saved because I'm probably going to get crashed out.
[105:07.08]And that's okay.
[105:09.58]So I have to exit the game anyway.
[105:12.13]So, I'll be right back.
[105:13.85]I'll make a poll.
[105:17.17]Give me one second while I do it.
[105:24.23]And by the time I get back, that's the amount of time you're going to get to vote.
[105:26.55]So if you want to have a choice here, I suggest you click on one of these.
[105:33.33]So we've got Mania and then Dementia.
[105:35.85]You can only pick one of these, I guess.
[105:46.06]Here is the poll.
[105:47.80]And I will edit the AI&I.
[105:54.35]to make it so I can get the FOV to permanently be there.
[105:56.53]Is it just a simple, just writing the folder in the INI?
[105:59.11]Is it something as stupidly easy as just changing that?
[106:03.20]We'll see it when we get back.
[106:04.14]Alright, good luck, DaVinci or Mania.
[106:07.18]See you in a minute.
[109:42.29]How are we here?
[109:44.61]I got a water tube.
[109:45.95]Some ice water.
[109:47.77]Just filled it up.
[109:48.81]Figured I was going to need it.
[109:51.69]So I could prove to everybody that I'm drinking water before they freak out.
[109:56.30]Alright, now let me... Let's go to the documents page here.
[110:00.02]Let's see if this works.
[110:02.86]Somebody said that I can actually screw up the menu if I do this, but... Is that a problem or should I just say fuck it and just do what I've been doing?
[110:20.65]Heck it.
[110:21.37]Fuck it.
[110:22.81]Check the poll.
[110:24.22]Looks like Mania is winning here by a pretty large margin.
[110:34.56]Let's just see how quickly this is going to be.
[110:36.92]Documents, I'm assuming it's Bethesda.
[110:38.81]There it is.
[110:40.05]Call of Cthulhu.
[110:41.15]That's incorrect.
[110:44.11]The Elder Scrolls, maybe.
[110:48.57]Where is this?
[110:51.95]I actually don't have it here.
[110:56.26]And right on cue, Comcast decides to drop a shitload of frames.
[111:01.36]That's great.
[111:05.79]Get the FOV modifier mod.
[111:13.59]It's alright.
[111:15.11]I can just change it.
[111:17.11]I think that's going to take a little too long here.
[111:19.25]I mean, is it as easy as it is just you just grab and throw it in the folder?
[111:29.32]Plus, actually, we're hitting some frame drops here.
[111:31.50]So actually, it probably should just wait a minute.
[111:33.00]Alright, let's see.
[111:37.82]FOV fix oblivion PC, right?
[111:41.14]Like, obviously, it would be PC, but...
[111:43.78]If you want to change the value type start quest FOV in the console and menu will appear again.
[111:48.46]Oh, hold on.
[111:51.10]It's just, here it is.
[111:54.87]We dropped any more frames.
[111:58.07]This mod allows you to change the field of view from the default 75 and the new value you choose will not be reset every time you talk or zoom in.
[112:05.01]Okay.
[112:05.33]That's good.
[112:06.89]Let's get it.
[112:11.63]Uh,
[112:17.31]Seems good so far.
[112:18.45]That was weird.
[112:20.63]I have to sign up for Nexus mods, don't I?
[112:23.47]Manual download.
[112:26.36]Fuck, I don't have an account here.
[112:34.44]I guess, wait, what about just the gaming wiki?
[112:38.53]Install the FOV modifier.
[112:42.81]You don't have to sign up.
[112:47.48]Well, why the hell is it making me?
[112:51.48]Download manual, right?
[112:59.50]It says, please log in or sign up to download this file.
[113:10.48]That's...
[113:16.18]Download the mod, not the manual.
[113:17.88]No, it's a manual.
[113:19.80]It's under files.
[113:21.80]FOV modifier.
[113:23.16]Mod manager download or manual download.
[113:25.68]When I click it, I get that again.
[113:28.76]I just don't have an account here.
[113:39.37]Whatever.
[113:40.65]It's alright.
[113:41.89]I'll just fix it.
[113:44.13]Looks like we're doing mania, by the way.
[113:48.86]Mania has won, it's- and like I said, fucking god damn it, man.
[113:53.92]Did the stream just turn off?
[114:01.13]Uh, okay.
[114:07.85]You gonna- you gonna like, cut this out?
[114:09.97]Internet here?
[114:10.53]What- what, are you gonna stop this shit?
[114:12.09]What's going on here?
[114:13.78]Come on.
[114:14.92]You can do it.
[114:17.06]You can do it.
[114:20.62]I've got faith in you.
[114:21.44]You can pull through this.
[114:22.62]Come on.
[114:23.18]You can do it.
[114:31.37]I think we're fine.
[114:33.65]It's just having problems.
[114:35.41]It's having issues.
[114:38.03]Alright.
[114:39.74]Well, let's get going here because we might not have very much time.
[114:43.20]So let's just go.
[114:44.14]Because I don't know how much more time we have left before this just turns off.
[114:52.13]Back to it.
[114:59.24]Get this back up.
[115:02.76]Alright.
[115:03.50]Good, good, good.
[115:04.38]Let's go.
[115:06.80]If it does turn off, that sucks.
[115:09.70]And I'm sorry to, I'm very sorry about that.
[115:12.16]But obviously there's nothing I can do about it.
[115:14.92]Gonna go as long as we can without it dying.
[115:20.77]load it was this one right here 547. so mania has won mania is in as in the lead so we're gonna go with mania thank you for voting let's go mania entrance
[115:50.66]Door open to Ketomania.
[115:56.14]The sound is all warped?
[115:58.09]What?
[116:00.85]Seek out Shigarath.
[116:04.49]What internet will I have in Las Vegas?
[116:06.31]I will have Cox.
[116:10.45]And we are going to have a hybrid fiber line.
[116:19.35]You don't hear it.
[116:22.96]It's an issue with Chrome.
[116:23.98]Oh, that's weird.
[116:27.28]The thing about... The thing about internet companies is they are all terrible.
[116:31.73]But... In that house, there's going to be... It'll be like about 30 to 40 upload.
[116:38.33]So the upload speed will be about 35.
[116:41.29]And then we have 1,000 megabytes.
[116:44.58]Whatever megabits for download.
[116:47.12]So this place looks cool.
[116:52.88]So we have a great download.
[116:54.62]I mean, 35, 40 upload, that's pretty great.
[116:57.46]As long as it's consistent and real.
[117:00.34]Hold on, let me... I need to go soothing touch, cold touch.
[117:09.59]What happened to my heal?
[117:18.09]Did I lose my heal?
[117:21.88]No, okay.
[117:22.44]I was going to say, what?
[117:24.36]Blessing of Mania.
[117:25.30]Frenzy up to level 12 in 30 foot... What?
[117:33.09]Frenzy up to level 12 in 30 feet for 30 seconds on target.
[117:38.49]So I make somebody harder.
[117:51.82]Jump instead of running.
[117:52.96]It helps your stats.
[117:55.06]Wait, we got weird shit going on here.
[118:01.32]That's so dumb.
[118:03.46]Jump everywhere.
[118:05.78]So it looks like... We're going this way.
[118:12.05]Alright, here's... I thought this was not supposed to be the crazy place.
[118:16.03]This is supposed to be the happy place.
[118:19.12]Frenzy makes them just go crazy and attack anything.
[118:21.31]Okay.
[118:22.67]The audio?
[118:23.23]I don't... They're both bad.
[118:33.77]Oh, okay.
[118:39.87]Is this guy crazy?
[118:44.54]Yes?
[118:45.60]I'm J. Red Ice Veins.
[118:47.77]Do you ever wonder why things look better without their skin on?
[118:52.95]For instance, you can only really see the bones when you take them out.
[118:58.67]You can hear them better that way, too.
[119:04.98]The gatekeeper's dead.
[119:06.60]He won't stop us from coming and going now.
[119:09.90]I get it.
[119:10.96]Anybody can just go wherever they want.
[119:13.74]I haven't heard much about him.
[119:15.92]I'm thinking about going down to Anvil to hear him for myself.
[119:19.16]Very nice bones.
[119:21.42]If you visit Highcross, speak with Merely Ulven.
[119:25.10]She needs help with her project.
[119:28.92]Make it quick.
[119:35.71]We should... Those bones want out.
[119:40.49]Stop.
[119:41.05]Leave me alone.
[119:46.49]Fungus stock.
[119:49.43]So this is a whole new map.
[119:53.02]That's interesting.
[119:54.64]So where exactly am I going to?
[119:59.18]Oh, Jesus.
[120:00.34]Okay, I gotta go all the way down here.
[120:01.84]Are there side quests?
[120:07.34]Not in here, I guess.
[120:09.87]Seek out Shigarath.
[120:13.73]That's it.
[120:15.71]I cannot fast travel.
[120:17.07]I have to find that location.
[120:18.51]So I'm going to listen to what the person told me a long time ago.
[120:23.05]And let's go on the road.
[120:23.99]We're going to take the road there.
[120:27.49]We're going to go on the road.
[120:32.23]Give them your bones.
[120:38.73]So this is where we're going to just go the road.
[120:40.76]I wish I had a horse.
[120:51.38]Why is the lizard so ugly?
[120:56.73]Um.
[121:00.29]Why don't you say that to his face?
[121:04.17]You know what I mean?
[121:05.85]That'll happen.
[121:11.41]And then the funeral proceedings will start.
[121:14.04]You know what I mean?
[121:15.98]If you're in this game and you come up and you talk like shit to me in the game here.
[121:19.90]Your character.
[121:31.02]be looking... If you come up to me in game and your character, you'd be looking like a flounder after we're done.
[121:36.47]Come on.
[121:46.33]What's going on?
[121:53.87]I'm going the right way.
[122:00.57]Wait.
[122:04.32]Is this the wrong road?
[122:09.64]I didn't take the other road.
[122:10.59]What do you mean it's the wrong road?
[122:18.33]Oh.
[122:20.17]So I have to go this way.
[122:21.07]This is the road of dementia, so this is the road of mania.
[122:31.72]Okay.
[122:32.50]Well, that makes sense, I guess.
[122:42.37]Thank you, Mr. Streamer.
[122:43.31]You're very welcome.
[122:54.86]So sad to see Dimension.
[122:56.66]No, I'm fine.
[122:59.38]Two new non-playable characters up here.
[123:02.12]Am I going on the road yet?
[123:10.75]Are these... What's this, like Twiddle Dee and Twiddle Dum?
[123:17.60]Golden Saint Guard.
[123:20.70]Golden Saint... These are just non-playable, uh, non... These are non-playable, non-important characters.
[123:26.66]I think we need to classify them in different ways.
[123:30.75]Games just put everybody in NPC.
[123:33.15]But... NP... Uh, NIC.
[123:39.11]Right?
[123:39.31]That's a non-playable, not important character.
[123:49.50]Or not important, non-playable character.
[123:51.66]So that would be NINPC.
[124:02.72]Green moat.
[124:03.34]Cool.
[124:06.93]Okay, I'm just going to sit here for an hour and heal.
[124:10.73]Alright, we're good.
[124:14.49]What?
[124:14.95]Oh.
[124:17.76]Get out of here, you non-important, not-adding-to-the-story, not-playable character.
[124:23.02]I just want to see what's up for a save.
[124:40.16]This is very pretty.
[124:40.82]Do you know what this reminds me of?
[124:44.84]I'm not even going to say it.
[124:45.78]Because I make a reference to it every stream.
[124:48.78]I haven't played it in almost a year and a half.
[124:51.46]But... What the hell is this thing?
[125:00.19]What is that?
[125:02.29]That's the weirdest enemy ever.
[125:03.71]It's like a tree person.
[125:12.49]More bark than bite, it seems.
[125:14.23]Hey!
[125:14.33]Speaking of bark.
[125:15.67]Is this a shield?
[125:16.38]How much does this weigh?
[125:31.67]Alright, let's go.
[125:36.45]I like this zone.
[125:43.72]Many random people, random NPCs.
[125:45.10]What's with the music?
[125:54.92]Okay, that's why.
[125:57.03]What the hell?
[126:02.97]Fire, fire!
[126:15.31]Where'd his body go?
[126:21.19]Where's his body?
[126:22.13]Too much grass.
[126:28.39]I don't know where he is.
[126:29.08]Oh well.
[126:37.96]Let's find it for him.
[126:40.10]It's over.
[126:40.58]It's too late.
[126:53.59]What does this remind- finish the sentence.
[126:54.87]What does it remind you of?
[126:55.71]I can't say it.
[126:57.01]Because it's just... I can't make a reference to Mario, World of Warcraft, or Team Fortress every single stream.
[127:08.47]You know what I'm saying?
[127:10.73]We have to think of other video games that exist.
[127:22.41]Not born chamber.
[127:25.41]Interesting.
[127:29.93]Not born chamber.
[127:32.31]Should I go in here?
[127:32.87]Should I just explore?
[127:35.03]Yeah.
[127:44.68]I don't have any healing or anything.
[127:49.54]Let's do it.
[127:49.98]Let's go in here.
[127:56.61]There's probably a chest at the end of this.
[128:02.14]It's really dark down here, though.
[128:03.32]I need a torch.
[128:04.28]Torch instead of a... I think I'm just going to put a torch on.
[128:12.52]It's way too dark down here.
[128:15.87]Do I not have a torch?
[128:21.13]Did I sell my torches, all of them?
[128:24.71]No.
[128:25.37]Alright, we're good.
[128:28.30]I can't... Do them both?
[128:33.32]Why can't I... How do I hold them both?
[128:37.54]What?
[128:38.10]Okay.
[128:54.93]Nothing of use.
[128:57.27]Monster right there.
[129:00.52]Just turn on the light.
[129:02.98]There's a weird bug in there, too.
[129:12.22]Cool.
[129:15.26]Is that a praying mantis down there?
[129:19.71]Interesting.
[129:23.01]Ooh, Amber.
[129:25.04]It's like honey down here.
[129:28.38]Where'd he go?
[129:32.21]Should I go kill this?
[129:33.85]No, let's keep looking.
[129:34.99]Is this poison?
[129:44.09]Weak potion of healing.
[129:45.15]Uh, yep.
[129:51.39]I got an actual rare drop.
[129:52.73]Did I really?
[129:56.15]Well, that's cool.
[129:58.87]That's part of the actual literal rare drop.
[130:02.09]1% drop rate.
[130:09.93]That's pretty... Alright.
[130:11.94]I'm okay with that.
[130:12.66]You're talking about the Amber?
[130:21.42]I can't wait to accidentally sell that and forget in like four hours.
[130:29.28]Then everyone's gonna freak out.
[130:31.44]It's not gonna go well for me.
[130:42.29]Don't pick up bones.
[130:43.11]Okay, we're good.
[130:52.93]There's gotta be something at the end of this, right?
[131:24.47]2000... 2006.
[131:24.53]Good old 2006.
[131:25.05]I think I'm cracking up!
[131:26.51]Am I just paranoid?
[131:27.29]No singing.
[132:03.53]2006 was 20 years ago?
[132:05.27]2006 was not 20 years ago.
[132:10.26]Let's get that clear, first of all.
[132:15.50]That was about 12 years ago.
[132:17.36]That's a lot of money in there.
[132:22.79]Why would a bug have that much money?
[132:32.25]Can I pick the honey from here?
[132:35.51]I can.
[132:42.67]It's odd because we live in a time, you know, in gaming years, you could say, right?
[132:50.51]Where 20 to 30 years ago, games were like MS Paint drawings, right?
[132:58.82]In another 30 years, this will be a game that your grandparents played.
[133:03.44]You know what I mean?
[133:05.92]What was that old thing that grandpa used to do?
[133:09.22]What was it called?
[133:09.86]Oblivion.
[133:10.78]Interesting.
[133:11.40]It's so weird to think about that.
[133:19.39]Like, your great-great-great-grandkids will be playing a game.
[133:24.98]They might go back and this would be the equivalent of going back to old photos, right?
[133:28.20]We've talked about old photos and how weird it's gonna be when you have like 25 dog face pictures on Snapchat.
[133:37.88]Holy shit, this is pretty good, isn't it?
[133:43.54]That looks better than what I have on.
[133:46.77]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a minute.
[133:48.53]This is $500.
[133:54.67]This is all nice.
[133:55.41]I'm taking it all.
[133:58.09]Are those better than what I have on?
[133:59.71]Was that the chest?
[134:00.49]Did I find the actual end of the game chest?
[134:02.87]Or end of the level chest?
[134:11.14]It's one-handed.
[134:11.74]It's time to go home.
[134:19.93]Alright, Greaves.
[134:20.61]This is three heavy armor and three defense.
[134:23.87]What are the other ones?
[134:26.14]Heavy armor and two defense.
[134:28.16]Yeah, these are going on.
[134:30.88]Oh, fuck.
[134:31.65]Reeves are not gauntlets.
[134:33.11]Wait, wait.
[134:33.43]Yes, they are.
[134:35.77]Aren't they?
[134:36.37]No.
[134:39.31]That's three.
[134:40.05]They're both three.
[134:40.69]Which one has more durability?
[134:42.05]Ninety... That's the same thing.
[134:49.16]These are technically better.
[134:52.24]Just because they have more durability.
[134:53.54]But, oh, hold on.
[134:54.10]What else did I pick up?
[134:54.96]I got...
[134:55.88]This thing's just nice.
[134:56.76]Damn.
[135:00.08]Why am I holding these?
[135:04.82]Do I have to get rid of some more rakes?
[135:07.59]I could get rid of this.
[135:08.25]Yeah.
[135:10.83]I could get rid of that.
[135:12.87]Get rid of this, too.
[135:14.25]Spare some room.
[135:19.17]Folded cloth.
[135:22.25]I don't know what this is.
[135:23.63]Knife.
[135:25.25]Paintbrush.
[135:29.33]Pickaxe.
[135:30.13]Do I... I don't need this.
[135:31.59]Repair hammer.
[135:32.91]Pickaxe?
[135:33.39]I don't need a pickaxe.
[135:45.85]Use the repair hammer.
[135:55.23]How many times can I do this?
[136:00.26]I can just do this as many times as I want until it breaks.
[136:06.00]I'm assuming, right?
[136:07.22]Okay, that makes sense.
[136:11.16]Okay, cool.
[136:14.36]Armor skill is increased.
[136:20.80]Well, now I know how that works.
[136:23.53]No, I don't need to repair the mace.
[136:26.13]I have this axe now.
[136:29.31]These both are classified as blunt, so it's the same thing.
[136:35.42]We're good.
[136:36.80]I just freaked out.
[136:37.42]I forgot I dropped everything.
[136:38.40]Alright.
[136:40.68]Steal the paintbrush again.
[136:47.15]Keep the mace to fight ghosts.
[136:48.53]I figured if it was useful then, it would be useful at some point again, too.
[137:04.46]Is that more rare drop?
[137:06.38]Look at all these rare drops.
[137:08.87]I'm killing it right now.
[137:09.81]Oh, shit.
[137:32.84]arrows drop the arrows I dropped the mace is so heavy but drop the greaves yeah yeah you're right you're right when you're right you're right
[138:01.07]Okay.
[138:01.57]We're fine.
[138:04.20]Drop pants.
[138:05.44]No, I see what you're doing there, but that's fine.
[138:07.74]I think I've explored the whole cave.
[138:10.50]Very cool.
[138:11.60]Is there anything else I didn't do?
[138:14.85]This looks like, hey, you made it to the last room here.
[138:28.92]Oh, well.
[138:31.39]This is where I came in.
[138:34.13]Did I go all the way down here?
[138:35.37]I guess I kind of can just leave.
[138:44.38]Let's just go straight across then.
[138:50.38]Can I go straight that way?
[138:53.38]I did come back.
[138:54.94]Drop mace.
[138:55.48]I'm not dropping the mace.
[138:56.46]I want to hold it.
[139:02.17]So we didn't go all the way down.
[139:03.79]Am I going to get hurt if I go down here?
[139:07.15]Because this just wraps this way.
[139:14.47]I guess I can go this way.
[139:18.85]Is there an exit right there, though?
[139:19.91]Alright, we're good.
[139:25.82]Straight through here.
[139:26.52]I remember killing this thing.
[139:29.00]This thing's dead, right?
[139:30.28]Yeah.
[139:32.73]Yeah, we went that way.
[139:34.01]Right, right, right.
[139:34.73]Okay, I understand.
[139:35.73]We go through here, and this is the end.
[139:44.46]Ooh, root door to the cavities.
[139:53.28]Shit, alright.
[139:55.94]Let me keep going.
[139:56.64]I feel like I'm going to have to come down here for something eventually.
[140:00.66]Who knows for what it is.
[140:10.22]Don't really... Restore Endurance.
[140:13.82]Shield.
[140:14.44]I mean, I guess I could just eat this shit, right?
[140:20.77]I never use random consumables in RPGs like this.
[140:25.25]Ever.
[140:25.67]I don't know why.
[140:26.23]I just don't.
[140:28.81]I just kind of don't do it.
[140:31.02]Let's eat the bark.
[140:38.19]Restore health.
[140:39.77]Those flame stalks restore health.
[140:45.84]That's good to know.
[140:46.42]Because the games I've played are casual trash.
[141:00.98]I mean, I didn't do that in Dark Souls.
[141:02.96]I played that like a month ago.
[141:10.37]I don't know if I would consider Dark Souls to be a casual game.
[141:18.70]Dark Souls is casual.
[141:21.30]What do you mean casual?
[141:23.44]What would be considered not casual?
[141:26.68]What's a game that's not casual?
[141:28.82]Tell me.
[141:35.92]Demon's Souls.
[141:36.56]Well, guess what?
[141:38.00]I played that too and beat that whole game.
[141:45.02]Fortnite.
[141:45.59]Alright, now I know you're just making the joke on me here.
[141:58.11]Phantasy Star Online 2.
[142:03.00]You can't even play that game.
[142:04.96]That game was disconnected from the internet like fucking 16 years ago.
[142:08.52]Alright, where are we at?
[142:14.03]Local map.
[142:17.15]Got another place we can go, but let's just keep going over here.
[142:21.09]Keep saying Fortnite for ad revenue.
[142:22.77]I don't think I want to drop down here.
[142:31.08]There's another way to go.
[142:34.08]This is not going to hurt me though, right?
[142:35.46]Not really.
[142:37.13]We're good.
[142:40.59]Fantasy Star Online.
[142:41.97]The MMO before MMOs.
[142:51.58]Restore Magicka.
[142:52.57]Ooh.
[142:53.47]I could use that right now.
[143:00.45]Has he given an excuse for how late the daytime stream started?
[143:04.61]Well, last... I don't know if you were here last night, but we... I didn't turn the stream off until, like, 2 o'clock in the morning.
[143:12.02]I didn't actually fall asleep until, like, 3 a.m.
[143:15.80]I said in the end of last night's stream that the day stream was not happening anymore.
[143:20.71]That's what I said.
[143:22.51]That's not an excuse.
[143:24.69]Last night, I said we're not doing a day stream today.
[143:27.97]I just told you last night.
[143:29.25]That's what I said!
[143:39.63]No, an excuse would be if I woke up today and started the stream and I gave you an excuse as to what happened.
[143:44.93]I never told you what the hell happened.
[143:48.02]I made it very clear that because I wasn't going to be going to bed till like 3 or 4 in the morning, that we weren't doing like a 12 o'clock stream.
[144:01.13]There's a clip somewhere.
[144:01.97]Don't worry.
[144:02.27]Someone will find it.
[144:03.43]Someone will absolve me of all my crimes here.
[144:07.65]What is the thing that heals me?
[144:16.46]Okay, where is it?
[144:17.18]Restores health.
[144:20.59]That's good.
[144:24.37]Oh, you're a disgrace.
[144:26.43]Why?
[144:26.75]Ooh, that's a two-hander.
[144:30.83]But I can't fucking... Amber arrow.
[144:33.59]Gold.
[144:36.01]Amber arrow matrix.
[144:43.50]Found an unusual item called the Matrix.
[144:45.04]It looks like a mold of some kind and seems magical.
[144:47.20]I should ask around.
[144:48.12]Someone in the Shivering Isles must know what this is used for.
[144:52.05]I want to take this.
[144:57.79]This guy has the audacity to call himself a professional top 1,000 streamer.
[145:08.68]I can't believe it either.
[145:11.10]Should I even pick this up?
[145:12.94]I mean...
[145:14.57]It has more damage than anything, but it's two-handed.
[145:16.58]I don't really want to... Not yet.
[145:18.50]I don't think so.
[145:24.16]It was worth a shot.
[145:25.70]Where are we?
[145:26.16]Right here.
[145:26.72]We can go.
[145:27.22]Let's go.
[145:27.80]Let's close up the circle here.
[145:40.20]I really want a cure major wounds.
[145:42.52]I wonder where I get that.
[145:44.74]Alright, so we've made the complete circle.
[145:46.02]I can just turn around.
[145:46.84]Did I open this?
[145:51.26]Might not just get a better healing spell.
[145:53.66]I'll try.
[145:58.16]I'll try my hardest.
[146:03.36]The music is really good.
[146:07.02]Even the random little dialog sequences have an interesting little melody to them.
[146:13.92]It's the only place we haven't gone.
[146:14.96]Let's see what it leads to.
[146:25.18]Leads us to a spider.
[146:26.46]Come on, give me that flame stalk.
[146:33.76]Come on, got it.
[146:34.32]You can touch every one of these.
[146:39.44]If you're a completionist, this game is...
[146:43.15]Just everything you want.
[146:43.99]I'm just going to use that.
[146:51.60]Semi-absolved of crimes.
[146:53.96]Only a little bit.
[146:55.36]Only slightly.
[147:03.74]Get another path here.
[147:06.11]No, not really.
[147:06.83]Don't be a chest over here, though.
[147:08.13]No.
[147:14.93]I'm only level two I am taking my time not bone juncture we go even deeper even deeper level three the endurance of hate level three oh something's going on in here
[147:49.65]Drain Endurance and Long Pick.
[147:52.84]This looks like a significant place.
[147:56.56]There's probably something in here.
[148:06.81]I hear breathing.
[148:10.15]What's with the heavy breathing?
[148:11.73]Oh, it's a mage.
[148:21.46]Alright, so what is this thing?
[148:26.24]Staff of Flames.
[148:27.53]That's fire damage, 10 points on target.
[148:32.63]I can pick this up and I can sell it.
[148:34.57]That's pretty good.
[148:38.50]Bone Shard, Eggs.
[148:48.00]I shouldn't be picking all this up, but I... I can't help it.
[148:52.49]I have to pick up everything.
[148:54.25]That's the way it is.
[148:55.15]It's the way I've always been.
[148:57.17]Fruits?
[149:05.26]See, that's why you gotta check everybody.
[149:06.56]Alright, so what the hell is in here?
[149:16.45]madness ore can I sleep level up yet I need to figure out what to do with this stuff seriously I could just use them or throw them away right I don't need these anymore but they don't have any weight
[149:47.83]Get rid of the mace.
[149:50.41]It's done.
[149:56.79]It's done.
[149:57.53]It's done.
[149:57.87]Give me the gold ring back.
[150:03.25]It's a piece of shit, but it's my piece of shit.
[150:07.09]You know?
[150:16.38]I think that's it.
[150:18.02]No, wait, what's this?
[150:19.88]Oh, that's probably the exit.
[150:25.47]Unless there's something else.
[150:34.25]No, the chest, no, the box, no, nothing.
[150:42.28]I'm turning into a hoarder.
[150:45.06]I mean, I am, but... No, the pipes?
[150:50.12]We're still going.
[151:05.42]Nice parry, but it's not gonna save your life.
[151:12.78]Fur boots.
[151:13.80]Terrible.
[151:14.20]Just give me the gold.
[151:22.06]Crate?
[151:23.86]No.
[151:24.88]Madness ore?
[151:26.92]That stuff is nice.
[151:30.12]Sells for a lot.
[151:38.28]Don't.
[151:39.68]Randomly snake dog.
[151:46.51]This is the end.
[151:48.03]There's nowhere else to go.
[151:54.22]Well, there is more to go.
[151:55.04]Fuck.
[151:59.40]Flawed ruby.
[152:02.00]Oh, no.
[152:02.60]No, there's so many things over here.
[152:04.10]A cloth.
[152:05.32]Crystal ball.
[152:06.16]Hourglass.
[152:10.48]There's a bowl.
[152:11.00]There's a pitchfork.
[152:13.33]How much does it weigh?
[152:17.14]I can't pick this all up.
[152:18.64]Spoon.
[152:19.10]A crystal ball, though.
[152:22.84]That's cool.
[152:29.22]What the fuck was that?
[152:32.76]Why did I just get horror movied?
[152:35.28]My torch ran out.
[152:36.32]Okay.
[152:38.84]Didn't I get something that I can eat in this light?
[152:46.63]No, that doesn't make the room light up.
[152:58.44]Alchemy.
[153:00.44]Do I have... Okay, novice mortar and pestle.
[153:04.68]Combine ingredients with like effects to create potions and poisons.
[153:07.38]Your alchemy skill will make your creations more powerful.
[153:10.15]The more potions you create, the higher your alchemy skill will go.
[153:12.55]Use additional apparatuses to improve the strength of the potions.
[153:16.20]Alright, so let's just talk about this for one second.
[153:22.50]I thought I was going to have to go to an alchemy table in a town somewhere.
[153:26.92]I did not know that it was just in your menu.
[153:29.46]I thought it was just... I knew I had the mortar and pestle, but I thought I had to be at a table somewhere in town.
[153:36.18]So, add ingredient.
[153:37.04]What do we got?
[153:38.94]This.
[153:40.38]Do I even have a recipe?
[153:49.78]Restore?
[153:51.00]I guess maybe I have to put the same... So I guess... Just a guess?
[154:14.70]What was it?
[154:15.18]Filter?
[154:16.32]No.
[154:22.54]This is Restore Fatigue, Light, and then Restore Fatigue, Shield, and then an unknown effect.
[154:30.57]Restore Fatigue, Silence, Restore Damage, Magicka.
[154:33.27]Restore Fatigue, Shield.
[154:36.06]Let's put a potato in here.
[154:41.94]Restore Fatigue, 5 points for 20 seconds on self.
[154:44.38]You just match the buffs.
[154:49.11]Motion of Potato Fruit.
[155:00.93]Bryce potato pear I just made vodka Alright potion of cure what was it right here is this gonna light up when I can do this where's my light
[155:28.78]Do I have to match the light?
[155:39.91]Yeah, light to light.
[155:40.89]Does it only have to be two?
[155:42.77]So you have to match two.
[155:43.67]You need to have two.
[155:44.57]It doesn't have to be three.
[155:45.25]Okay.
[155:46.09]That's pretty cool, actually.
[155:50.93]That makes no sense.
[155:51.71]No, I was right.
[155:52.53]I just have to get another one that has light.
[155:55.27]What's with this?
[155:56.53]This is weird.
[155:58.74]What in the name of God is happening to my body and character and life?
[156:03.54]Oh, fuck.
[156:06.26]There's something big in this room.
[156:12.46]Do I have a light, soothing light?
[156:14.28]Starlight.
[156:14.94]Light, 20 feet for 60 seconds.
[156:20.58]That's horrible.
[156:23.70]That's not even as far as headlights go in a car.
[156:25.58]Okay.
[156:28.29]That's the worst.
[156:31.09]I just got hurt by that rock.
[156:40.57]Where is it?
[156:44.49]It's not even that bad!
[156:46.36]It's just a bug.
[156:47.28]It's not even anything bad.
[156:48.20]That looked way bigger.
[156:51.02]That cereal looked way bigger on the front of the box.
[157:00.67]Restore Intelligence.
[157:05.64]I need some Restore Magicka.
[157:09.44]Go back to the Alchemy table.
[157:12.52]No, I don't want that.
[157:20.40]So let's see, I need two of each one.
[157:21.50]Restore Intelligence, Restore Health, Fortify Magicka.
[157:26.80]Alright, Fortify Magicka.
[157:28.46]I guess I could do it twice, right?
[157:30.65]What else we got?
[157:31.87]So I need Restore Intelligence and Fortify Magicka.
[157:33.75]This is a Restore Magicka.
[157:37.09]Restore Fatigue.
[157:46.48]Burden.
[157:46.96]Restore Willpower.
[157:47.84]Drain Fatigue.
[157:48.52]Drain Health.
[157:49.02]Why would you make that?
[157:50.74]Restore Intelligence.
[157:51.64]Fortify.
[157:52.02]Okay.
[157:52.66]It's the same thing.
[157:56.72]Well, let's just make one.
[157:59.78]Can I split this?
[158:04.74]I should be able to split that in half, right?
[158:06.11]Is there a way I can split that?
[158:15.67]Poisons and you apply them to weapons.
[158:16.86]Okay.
[158:17.10]It's two different ingredients.
[158:21.42]Okay, so now you're telling me this, right?
[158:23.92]Tell me this.
[158:27.12]So... This is not permanent.
[158:30.61]This is only for like 60 seconds.
[158:34.53]Alright, so this adds to my 16 points from the magic over 63 seconds.
[158:39.69]Restore one intelligence point for 6 seconds.
[158:47.37]So, um... I guess?
[158:56.34]Is it doing a thing?
[159:03.52]I guess it did a little bit.
[159:14.40]Fortify just increases the max.
[159:17.02]Yeah.
[159:18.64]I gotta have to figure out a solution for that.
[159:20.82]Why did I pick that move?
[159:23.55]Why did I pick that?
[159:26.41]I have the worst thing.
[159:27.89]I'm sure it works with some builds, but man.
[159:34.04]This not regenerating is the fucking worst.
[159:39.42]That's the worst thing ever.
[159:49.09]I'm going to put this on the menu here because, I mean, come on now.
[159:56.81]Now put this on two.
[160:00.53]And then put the heel on one.
[160:09.01]Just change it with the console commands.
[160:10.67]I feel like eventually that might be, it might work out eventually.
[160:15.47]Maybe.
[160:24.22]What's even in here?
[160:31.90]Come on, do it.
[160:34.74]How would you block with that?
[160:36.07]How?
[160:36.55]Why am I just bouncing off your head?
[160:41.06]Stick with the terrible choice.
[160:42.26]I deserve it.
[160:42.82]I do.
[160:43.16]I know.
[160:44.29]I deserve it.
[160:45.95]I know I do.
[160:49.45]But how long do I have to be in jail for, you know?
[161:00.37]Ooh, repair hammer.
[161:03.87]Money.
[161:06.23]Topaz.
[161:07.69]Sapphire.
[161:13.65]There's a chest here.
[161:14.51]Can I sleep in this?
[161:15.33]I can sleep in this bed.
[161:20.11]Damage, fatigue, gold.
[161:25.05]There are enemies nearby.
[161:26.63]I can't do that.
[161:32.20]Just drink potions to restore magicka.
[161:34.28]I guess I need to find... I need to make just a shitload of the potions.
[161:40.53]Whatever restores Magicka, I need to make a hundred of them.
[161:44.88]So, restore Magicka.
[161:46.82]That's what I'm looking for.
[161:47.60]I don't think I have any.
[161:59.66]Unless I can burden, restore Magicka, shield.
[162:03.13]I guess I could do this.
[162:13.76]So, eat it.
[162:19.88]Use the filter?
[162:20.90]Will the filter actually just filter out what exactly... Okay, that makes sense.
[162:28.13]Can't see.
[162:33.91]God damn it!
[162:43.33]Bones.
[162:43.73]I don't want those.
[162:44.45]Mindless aura.
[162:45.03]You had some.
[162:51.03]These are deep dungeons.
[162:56.08]If you pick one, it only shows like effects anyways.
[162:58.20]Okay.
[162:58.56]That's good to know.
[163:01.96]These are deep.
[163:03.22]These go a long way.
[163:04.28]This is not just a small chamber.
[163:06.32]These realm... Wait.
[163:07.90]Hold on.
[163:12.44]Is that it?
[163:17.96]Who the hell am I?
[163:27.99]I just reached the end.
[163:37.13]What?
[163:37.59]Are you?
[163:38.15]Who are you?
[163:43.75]Look at this.
[163:48.97]This is crazy looking.
[163:52.79]So, am I in a different... Where the hell did I end up?
[163:57.61]The realm of Shagorath.
[164:02.00]Alright.
[164:02.48]I don't see a road anymore.
[164:04.06]I gotta get back on the road.
[164:14.68]Iron bow.
[164:15.22]No.
[164:15.52]Fuck it.
[164:15.84]Don't want that.
[164:21.05]The world is turning upside down.
[164:22.63]Get me back to a road.
[164:27.91]By the nine divine, stay on the road!
[164:30.15]I know, I didn't listen to the advice.
[164:41.60]So alchemy is really cool.
[164:43.78]It only took me about six and a half to seven hours in the game to realize that.
[164:49.83]What is this?
[165:18.59]That was mine!
[165:19.33]What the fuck did I just pick up?
[165:33.86]Jesus.
[165:35.64]That was almost 6,000 gold.
[165:36.50]These guys suck.
[165:50.51]I gotta get out of here.
[165:51.19]Okay, get me on the road.
[165:57.62]Back to the road.
[165:58.32]Back to the road, quick.
[165:59.20]I need a road.
[166:03.10]What can I buy with $6,000?
[166:06.06]I feel like I'm the guy that hit the lottery.
[166:09.52]I got the lottery ticket in my hand.
[166:10.74]I just have to go cash it in.
[166:11.74]It doesn't have anybody's name on it.
[166:16.98]And everybody knows that I have it.
[166:22.54]Guy goes over the loudspeaker and says, Jeremy has a winning ticket for $50 million.
[166:26.60]He's currently walking to the place to redeem it.
[166:30.88]Jesus Christ.
[166:32.18]I don't feel safe right here.
[166:40.00]Why do you care about money so much?
[166:41.10]You're acting like a WoW character who is pumped he has a thousand gold, but vendor gear.
[166:46.85]Yeah, but now I can upgrade.
[166:48.01]I can buy something, right?
[166:49.49]I can craft something.
[166:52.35]I can buy 6,000 rakes.
[166:53.79]Wait, wait, wait.
[166:55.91]Let me go back to the
[166:59.10]I got some new ingredients.
[167:00.17]Restore Magicka.
[167:02.89]Restore Magicka.
[167:05.09]What if I do three?
[167:07.29]No.
[167:08.07]That's too much for my brain right now.
[167:24.22]So, there's never a reason to drink more than one of these potions, right?
[167:29.49]Where are the amulets?
[167:33.99]Is that going to reduce its value?
[167:37.89]If I put this on and it takes damage, am I just going to... Is it not going to reduce value if it takes damage and gets bad or something?
[167:46.30]Spell absorption 14 points on self.
[167:52.22]This thing is insane.
[167:55.35]Are you kidding me?
[167:59.98]Why would it do that?
[168:00.64]I don't know, because... Who knows?
[168:02.96]I have no idea.
[168:04.02]I'm concerned.
[168:05.26]Alright, give me a road.
[168:17.77]Collectors aren't going to want it now.
[168:19.13]That's what I'm saying.
[168:20.69]Can I smash it with a hammer?
[168:21.69]A repair hammer?
[168:23.01]We got him.
[168:23.43]He put it on.
[168:23.91]I was about to take it off.
[168:38.86]Back to the road!
[168:46.37]Your illusion skill increased.
[168:47.47]You should rest and meditate on what you've learned.
[169:01.71]I've learned some new things.
[169:05.03]Alright, that's not a road.
[169:06.55]Very clearly.
[169:07.17]But where even... Alright.
[169:10.87]I gotta take... It's a road.
[169:12.11]I'm looking at it right now.
[169:13.84]Connect.
[169:15.18]Going north is too far.
[169:16.34]I think at this point... I'm just gonna go straight through.
[169:25.47]Because I... I can't go up.
[169:26.75]That's too far.
[169:27.35]We're gonna have to go down.
[169:40.62]Illusion and heavy armor.
[169:42.38]And he writes, ha ha ha, okay.
[169:54.51]I didn't pick this.
[169:55.47]This was a randomly generated class.
[169:57.23]If you want to blame somebody, blame the band Green Day.
[170:02.27]They picked it.
[170:05.13]We're just going through dementia.
[170:06.17]It's closer.
[170:16.95]What's that?
[170:20.32]That looks big.
[170:21.12]It's like a werewolf.
[170:23.88]Oh, this thing's tough, actually.
[170:28.42]Holy fuck, that guy hurts.
[170:34.30]Uh... Can I just, like, just sleep?
[170:37.44]I think I'm just gonna sit here.
[170:39.40]There's enemies nearby.
[170:44.94]Dammit.
[170:45.44]I have to heal then.
[170:52.52]Wait, I could just do it.
[170:53.72]I just pressed T. Alright, let's wait an hour.
[170:56.47]I have to rest out of bed.
[171:09.98]Get me in a bed.
[171:12.70]And we'll wake up refreshed.
[171:14.70]With some new skill points.
[171:16.24]Take the road, don't be an idiot.
[171:25.91]This place is cool, though.
[171:28.93]This is a pretty nice let's play.
[171:32.81]Well, I guess it kind of is, because I've never experienced this game before.
[171:39.27]And I've ruined Skyrim.
[171:41.53]Right?
[171:43.64]I never played Skyrim before.
[171:45.58]And I downloaded the Sliders mod.
[171:47.64]And it ruined the whole game.
[171:49.37]I could never play it ever again.
[171:52.55]I have to get an Elder Scrolls experience.
[171:55.67]This is the one I have here.
[172:00.60]So that's... We're gonna go up this way.
[172:02.46]And we'll make it there eventually.
[172:08.14]Is this still... Are we on 90 FOV?
[172:10.92]Yes.
[172:11.38]Just making sure.
[172:17.44]Why even turn that on?
[172:19.00]It's not doing anything.
[172:24.70]I'm just holding a lantern between my legs.
[172:28.30]I can't at least have it in my hand and hold it out.
[172:33.72]Morrowind is better.
[172:34.54]Morrowind is better than Oblivion, and Oblivion is better than Skyrim.
[172:38.86]I mean, that... I honestly feel like the Bethesda games are like the FromSoftware games.
[172:46.14]Dark Souls 1 is better than Dark Souls 3.
[172:47.96]Dark Souls 3 is better than Dark Souls 2.
[172:49.68]Demon's Souls is better than Dark Souls 2.
[172:51.06]It's like everybody has their own opinion about it.
[172:53.72]Alright, I'm gonna go over here.
[173:03.79]Just follow the road.
[173:11.82]Yeah, they're all wrong, and I'm right.
[173:16.10]Alright, we're almost there.
[173:30.77]New Shioth Palace, Bliss, and the Crucible.
[173:33.73]This is probably going to get interesting here.
[173:36.69]Dark Souls 3 is the worst.
[173:38.05]I think Dark Souls 3 is better than Dark Souls 2.
[173:47.17]Bloodborne is the best one.
[173:49.21]Sorry.
[173:49.91]I mean, if we're going with my opinion is the best opinion and no other opinion, my opinion, right?
[173:54.39]Like everybody's saying.
[173:56.09]Bloodborne, greater than sign.
[173:58.64]Demon's Souls, greater than sign.
[174:00.74]Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3, they're both there.
[174:04.40]Dark Souls 1 is a little bit better than Dark Souls 3.
[174:07.73]And then Dark Souls 2.
[174:19.86]Dark Souls 2 is the worst of the series by far.
[174:22.82]I will agree.
[174:24.42]I have to agree with that.
[174:29.44]Bloodborne is the best single-player game I've ever played.
[174:34.67]That's the best game I've ever played.
[174:37.39]Delete multiplayer, no multiplayer talk.
[174:39.07]That is a full-on fact for me.
[174:49.59]What is over here?
[174:53.22]What is this thing?
[174:55.58]You found the graveyard.
[174:57.40]Well, I kind of want to look at it.
[175:07.20]Uh... Is there something I can... Somebody's tombstone?
[175:12.42]Helene the Deaf.
[175:13.04]She never heard it coming.
[175:16.93]Here lies Blaze Set.
[175:18.91]Faster than the wind, dumber than a stump.
[175:23.57]Renesta lies here, covered in glory and dirt.
[175:30.07]Vilval Telram was thrown in this hole.
[175:32.69]Holy shit.
[175:33.59]Imagine being a comedy tombstone writer.
[175:38.62]Remember Endari.
[175:39.98]One day she will rise and take her vengeance.
[175:42.16]Okay, that one's a little different.
[175:43.62]We may as well have... We have to destroy this one.
[175:46.98]No zombies.
[175:49.58]Yeah, that one's this one.
[175:50.64]That one's that one.
[175:51.59]Vien Rinius, noble but poor.
[175:55.45]Lobgro Mergob died.
[175:57.55]We ate him and buried the bones here.
[176:01.77]May your spirit swim forever, mean half-tail.
[176:07.77]They're all jokes.
[176:10.87]Okay.
[176:13.35]That's humorous.
[176:17.96]That's fairly humorous.
[176:22.82]New Sheath Palace.
[176:23.82]Bliss.
[176:24.08]We just have to keep going.
[176:26.49]That one wasn't very funny.
[176:27.57]Because the road ends, though.
[176:31.63]I have to get in the palace.
[176:39.44]But... I put Bloodborne and Demon's Souls...
[176:44.18]very close next to each other.
[176:45.34]Bloodborne is just, obviously, it's a newer game.
[176:49.73]But they both felt very similar to me.
[176:51.73]They have a lot of the same mechanics.
[176:55.09]They fall in the same category.
[176:56.61]I like the hub world of both.
[176:57.87]I like the healing system in both.
[177:03.42]They're more of the same speed.
[177:09.04]Now, where's the front door?
[177:13.06]Pretty sure it's right here.
[177:15.68]Bloodborne would be 10 out of 10 if the frame rate wasn't so bad.
[177:21.16]You know, I have to agree with you there.
[177:22.81]I'm actually shocked.
[177:25.77]Don't go that way.
[177:26.73]I am shocked beyond belief that there has not been a PS4 Pro patch for Bloodborne.
[177:35.55]I don't know why.
[177:36.35]It exists solely to be able to do that.
[177:39.84]What's the one game that you would buy a PS4 Pro to play with 60 FPS?
[177:46.09]A Bloodborne.
[177:47.33]What?
[177:49.63]Why can I not get in here?
[177:50.41]I'm just gonna teleport in the castle.
[177:54.46]I haven't found it yet.
[177:55.38]Are you sure?
[177:55.78]I'm looking at it.
[177:56.64]I guess there's a side entrance?
[178:08.28]I guess.
[178:22.79]PS4 Pro exists only to sell 4K panels from Sony.
[178:26.09]I don't even care about the 4K.
[178:29.29]Just give me the extra frames in Bloodborne and I will buy the system.
[178:36.96]Alright.
[178:38.24]We have found this place.
[178:39.62]We've successfully harvarded the congealed goo there.
[178:43.18]Alright, we got a person.
[178:44.08]Dark seducer.
[178:52.04]Uh, alright.
[178:52.26]Tell me what you- how's- how are things?
[178:53.30]Sheogarith is our lord, ruler of the Shivering Isles.
[178:57.86]It is by his whim that the Maz can walk, and we serve our master to the death.
[179:04.45]Okay.
[179:05.37]The Maz can guard Crucible and New Sheogh.
[179:08.47]We ensure the demented remain orderly and respectful of our lord Sheogarith.
[179:16.26]The Shivering Isles are a reflection of our Lord Shaogarith.
[179:21.85]Divided, yet perfect.
[179:23.17]I would let this Succubus slay me.
[179:27.83]Walk with our Lord.
[179:29.04]Okay.
[179:32.12]Anything else to do here?
[179:32.94]I guess we just walk in the front door.
[179:43.16]Nothing of use, nothing of use.
[179:44.40]I gotta pick, I gotta, you know what I have to do?
[179:49.28]The next stream, I can't like, I can't ruin the game next stream.
[179:55.50]You know what I mean?
[179:56.04]I can't even play this game again until, what?
[179:59.16]Oh, hold on.
[180:01.44]This is important for us to talk about.
[180:02.84]Can I?
[180:03.18]Is this cloud saved?
[180:14.51]My computer's going into a box tomorrow.
[180:18.90]I can play this on the shit computer, right?
[180:27.24]I got it on Steam.
[180:27.94]I don't know how GOG is that.
[180:31.46]I can just rip the save file and just put it in, right?
[180:37.51]Okay.
[180:38.55]Alright, well then never mind.
[180:39.27]Yeah, that's fine then.
[180:40.13]Because I like this.
[180:42.05]I'm having a great time.
[180:47.44]I don't want to just... I'm going to want to play this.
[180:50.48]I don't want to just not play it.
[180:56.09]I'll be sad if I have to stop playing this for like two weeks.
[181:00.35]I want to at least get my fill of it, right?
[181:02.69]Alright, so we need to go... Up here.
[181:07.87]Nushia Palace.
[181:10.21]Let me just look around first.
[181:14.78]Pick up the tubers.
[181:15.84]That's what those actually are.
[181:17.66]I know you might think I was making a little joke there, but I wasn't.
[181:19.84]I promise.
[181:20.76]Door to it.
[181:21.44]No, I'm not.
[181:22.00]These are all locked up.
[181:30.28]You smelly cat.
[181:31.87]That's a dog.
[181:34.21]That's a dog.
[181:34.87]That's not a cat.
[181:35.43]You know what a dog is?
[181:38.01]Are you stupid?
[181:42.93]You got a problem?
[181:45.29]Yeah, bite him.
[181:47.39]Well, hello there.
[181:49.97]It's good to see such a well-equipped individual as yourself around these parts.
[181:54.87]That is definitely a cat.
[181:56.51]But you look tired.
[181:58.51]Carrying all that gear will do that to you.
[182:01.97]I'd be glad to shoulder some of the burden.
[182:05.58]Relieve you of that expensive stuff.
[182:09.24]I can try with him.
[182:10.66]Or is there something else I can take from you?
[182:13.56]I mean, help you with.
[182:16.72]Hold on, is this guy... Alright, while I'm talking to this guy, I got that necklace in my hand holding onto it while I talk.
[182:28.83]It's clutching in my hands.
[182:31.71]By all accounts, he preaches that the attack on Anvil Chapel is an omen of some kind of coming doom.
[182:39.48]You should go to Anvil and hear it for yourself.
[182:41.06]Don't trust a guy with a shit hairline?
[182:42.84]If you're interested, they say he preaches outside the chapel every day.
[182:47.15]That hairline is fine.
[182:48.17]He just doesn't have a lot of hair.
[182:51.87]What's wrong with this hairline?
[182:58.45]I'm trying to make him spin around.
[183:00.01]Like, I can't.
[183:02.77]Yeah, turn to the left of me.
[183:03.64]Let me take a good look at your hair.
[183:05.80]What's wrong with his hairline?
[183:12.94]He just doesn't, he has no, he has a dumb haircut.
[183:16.64]His hairline's not a problem.
[183:19.43]Hold on, did he take anything from me?
[183:22.83]Nope, I still have it.
[183:27.51]I'm so full.
[183:29.61]Ew, you smell worse than that cat, Bisha.
[183:33.37]Get away from me.
[183:36.41]Uh, what?
[183:37.33]He's still around.
[183:39.57]I've seen him skulking like the filthy cat he is.
[183:41.97]At least it's not mustache hair.
[183:44.85]You're true.
[183:45.73]You're true on that.
[183:46.43]He's still around.
[183:48.15]Alright, what do you know?
[183:49.05]I hear that Erel is fed up with Brythar's antics.
[183:52.78]He really wants something done about it.
[183:57.15]Okay.
[183:57.97]Irel has a big problem with Brythar.
[184:00.39]I don't know... Irel owns a magic shop in town called Irel's Mysteries.
[184:05.46]If you want to know more, I suggest you ask him yourself.
[184:10.40]We did.
[184:10.72]Hey, thanks, man.
[184:13.44]Say what you're going to say.
[184:15.00]Why don't we... You know what?
[184:18.76]You have a great day.
[184:22.55]Take care.
[184:25.47]Speak, madman.
[184:29.44]Someone should put here is Plutonius out of his misery nice man an Intriguing fellow from what I've heard a cut above the usual street corner rabble-rouser Is the talk of an eyes apparently?
[184:47.03]Alright Such adventures how I envy you he doesn't like jokes
[185:00.20]Shit.
[185:00.88]Okay, I did it.
[185:01.38]Have a nice day.
[185:01.72]I gotta stop doing that.
[185:05.12]I just wasted like $40.
[185:05.98]But what do I care?
[185:07.93]I've got like $6,000 here.
[185:32.36]It doesn't matter.
[185:33.60]I can give a $10 bill to anybody.
[185:36.68]I'm like the richest man in the North.
[185:45.26]Wherever we are.
[185:45.90]Alright, so let's... Should I do the side?
[185:50.58]Let me do the side mission.
[185:54.42]Uh...
[185:55.55]Earl has a problem with Brithar.
[185:57.47]They want something done about it.
[185:58.49]I should go and speak to him about it.
[185:59.65]Let's do it.
[186:01.36]Let's not just skip the whole damn thing.
[186:07.36]Earl's Mysteries.
[186:18.52]Alright.
[186:18.84]Do you have a bed I can sleep in?
[186:24.31]Not allowed in there.
[186:25.13]Okay.
[186:26.49]Let me level up first.
[186:30.27]Is there an inn?
[186:31.05]Bliss.
[186:31.71]I'm assuming Bliss is probably an inn.
[186:33.37]It sounds like an inn to me.
[186:40.85]Cutter's Weapons?
[186:41.67]Ooh.
[186:43.31]Museum of Oddities.
[186:48.00]There's the Mysteries.
[186:48.82]Did I miss it over here?
[186:54.57]Bliss does sound like it would be where I want to go.
[187:03.49]Things found.
[187:04.47]Aye.
[187:06.29]No, that's not an inn.
[187:09.52]The lost and found.
[187:10.36]I don't need to go there.
[187:11.18]Uh, the tap house!
[187:16.34]That sounds like a bar and club and inn combo.
[187:22.13]So, I don't have to pay.
[187:24.36]right who pays for rooms here just find a spot and just lie down
[187:53.25]I don't think I can do this
[188:37.40]It's just, it's 10 gold.
[188:39.00]I just spent like 30 gold in lockpicks.
[188:50.39]God damn it.
[188:53.55]Let me spend like 40 bucks for a $10 hotel room.
[188:59.54]I deserve it.
[189:00.22]I'm not going to reload.
[189:01.06]I deserve this.
[189:03.88]Don't get too close now.
[189:07.36]Well, it seems I am dying.
[189:10.52]Yes, these may be my last days in the Shivering Isles.
[189:16.02]That's not good.
[189:16.92]That is, unless someone like yourself could help me find the cure.
[189:22.04]But no one has taken me up on my offer, even with the promise of a reward.
[189:26.91]Wait a minute.
[189:28.99]What's the reward?
[189:30.03]I'm an adventurer.
[189:30.79]I can help you.
[189:32.35]Oh, well, it's been a good life, I suppose.
[189:38.18]Bed cure rubies.
[189:39.96]You know.
[189:41.00]Are you willing to help me?
[189:42.08]I think I can help you.
[189:43.68]Yes.
[189:44.52]Oh, thank you so much.
[189:48.48]I think I can help you.
[189:49.78]There's only one place in all the aisles to get the cure for what I have.
[189:54.45]Nutty Bramble.
[189:55.81]Nutty Bramble.
[189:56.83]I'll mark it on your map.
[189:59.51]There, on the lowest level of the place, is a pool containing the cure.
[190:05.48]Bubbles from a new statue?
[190:07.44]Maybe I get free... free room and board forever?
[190:09.30]That would be a pretty good reward, I would say.
[190:11.60]Alright, uh, bed.
[190:15.60]20 gold a night?
[190:16.10]Thanks a lot, guys.
[190:35.46]It's the one I was trying to open.
[190:37.70]It's the one I was trying to open.
[190:38.94]Got it!
[190:39.14]Just cut.
[190:55.75]Like, when you make the video, right?
[190:57.53]This is for either Holy Mac or, you know, just make it so when I click on auto attempt one time, it opens there.
[191:04.12]And then cut this part too.
[191:06.24]So, here.
[191:08.40]So, now here's your cutting point.
[191:09.52]3, 2.
[191:12.38]Got it.
[191:13.32]First fucking try.
[191:14.18]What's the, uh... What's the probability on that?
[191:17.22]That's like less than 0.001% or something, right?
[191:23.31]That's pretty cool.
[191:25.08]Well, I should probably go buy a lottery ticket Disgusting revolting revolting How do you steal stuff from your own room A cheap wine just drink it They left it there the concierge put it there.
[191:45.37]Why should I feel bad about this?
[191:51.28]I just drained my personality
[191:57.04]Wouldn't cheap wine increase my personality?
[192:01.12]Just sleep it off.
[192:01.74]Alright.
[192:03.18]Let's sleep for six hours.
[192:05.44]Get a full night's sleep.
[192:09.68]And level up.
[192:12.48]Level three.
[192:13.20]There it is.
[192:22.45]Sleep from 11 a.m.
[192:23.29]to 8 p.m.
[192:29.57]4 p.m.
[192:30.05]in the morning.
[192:32.25]No, we're not doing Green Day for this.
[192:36.09]I definitely have to do Strength.
[192:38.97]He's only level 3.
[192:40.29]Well, I mean, yes.
[192:42.95]We've been doing a bunch of random shit.
[192:44.61]I've been... Alright, Strength is, I mean, obvious.
[192:52.98]And Endurance is obvious.
[192:55.42]So what's the wild card here?
[193:01.92]Personality, like... Personality plus four, speed... It's light armor, though.
[193:12.08]I think I'm alright.
[193:13.62]Intelligence... Alchemy... Luck... Agility, sneak, security, willpower... This is like magic shit.
[193:32.98]Fast to move, and Athletics, Light Armor, and Acrobatics.
[193:42.85]Maybe a Jaja, but it's only +2.
[193:44.77]That sucks.
[193:48.79]I think I'm going to put it into Personality.
[193:51.74]No.
[193:52.08]Why would I do that?
[193:53.94]Speed.
[193:54.22]And we're done.
[194:02.32]I think the game... Okay, the game, like, crashed.
[194:06.66]Alright, so, what time is it?
[194:10.42]Let me go into my bag of tricks.
[194:15.35]Do you ever give yourself to creeps while you're leveling up?
[194:18.25]Sometimes.
[194:20.63]My, like, mind will play tricks on me, too.
[194:22.39]It's weird.
[194:25.93]When you add all those things up... My mind plays tricks on me.
[194:30.65]I give myself to creeps all the time.
[194:34.01]Like, I think I'm gonna be cracking up here soon.
[194:38.79]I always thought, like, maybe since I was, like, 17 or 18, that I was probably, like, just paranoid.
[194:44.85]But, you know.
[194:47.83]This way.
[194:54.79]That doesn't add up.
[194:57.43]Oh, there she is.
[194:58.21]Hi.
[195:01.27]That's not even her.
[195:01.79]Who are you?
[195:03.13]I'm Murine.
[195:04.83]If you have any secrets, I'm the one to tell.
[195:08.34]I won't share them with anyone but my family.
[195:11.40]Unless they're good ones, that is.
[195:15.16]Jeremiah, I don't have the time to listen to you whine.
[195:19.79]Well, I mean, that's understandable.
[195:22.25]It's pretty been put up about nothing all at once.
[195:29.47]The Ballywog are known to carry swamp fever.
[195:33.87]Pretty much everything and nothing at the same time, strangely enough.
[195:39.15]Take care.
[195:40.41]Alright, let's go do the rest of this.
[195:44.74]I've heard that he has a problem with sickly or... Let's do this one.
[195:48.32]We were already on it, so just to go into that magic shop.
[195:56.22]You don't have any money.
[195:58.26]You don't have any money.
[196:00.10]Hey!
[196:00.28]Don't worry.
[196:00.88]I took care of you.
[196:26.37]By the way, I just want to give you a little bit of advice.
[196:28.81]For tax purposes, I know that you just took that money and put it under the desk.
[196:33.93]You didn't process it.
[196:34.89]You still have $5 on your tax returns.
[196:36.98]You know, you made $5 from somebody that bought something like an hour ago.
[196:40.96]You've got to keep a receipt for that.
[196:42.34]I'm not going to say anything about it, but just in case.
[196:50.17]I thought they hated each other.
[196:59.93]Oh, and look!
[197:00.57]Look at how sick she is!
[197:02.43]She's like the hardest enemy in the game!
[197:05.74]No, I didn't want to pay!
[197:30.63]I wanted to just pay and have her leave.
[197:32.47]I'm not going to hit the dog.
[197:33.73]You don't even give me that.
[197:41.90]Whoa, I didn't do anything.
[197:42.94]I just loaded and the game exploded.
[197:50.52]F9 is reload.
[197:51.38]Okay, that's good.
[197:56.94]I just got your ass beat by an old woman on death's door.
[198:06.45]Oh, no, don't seduce me.
[198:10.28]Hello.
[198:11.62]Hi.
[198:11.98]Hello.
[198:16.70]I wish there was a... Hold right click.
[198:18.68]Throwaxe.
[198:21.08]Are we going to go this way?
[198:24.38]Earl's Mysteries.
[198:28.73]What's going on?
[198:30.85]What?
[198:32.95]Oh, he's not open.
[198:33.91]What time is it?
[198:35.47]Why do you close at 6pm?
[198:41.16]What a terrible store.
[198:42.82]6pm you closed.
[198:44.84]Fine, I'll wait. ...
[200:00.80]You thought you could escape Lord Shayagora's justice?
[200:08.74]Where am I?
[200:21.57]Alright.
[200:23.25]Whoa, it's all floating.
[200:24.45]Watch this.
[200:27.55]Nobody gives a shit, huh?
[200:40.32]I ruined it.
[200:40.86]I ruined it.
[200:41.32]Yeah, you just got toddlered.
[200:47.86]You didn't think you were expecting to get three-year-old toddler tantrums, did you?
[200:54.01]Yes.
[201:00.91]No, it's not open.
[201:05.00]This is why he's level three.
[201:10.08]Well, whatever.
[201:10.78]Alright, let's go.
[201:11.44]Wait.
[201:17.14]6.30.
[201:17.28]Are you open?
[201:18.60]No.
[201:19.38]When do you- What are your hours?
[201:27.62]When are you open?
[201:28.40]8 to 6?
[201:38.78]Open at 9.30 and close at 9 or 8.
[201:41.84]Come on, man.
[201:43.52]Let's talk.
[201:45.78]Firm arms, a strong back.
[201:48.38]Yes, you'll do nicely.
[201:50.54]It's a shame.
[201:51.58]Time will ravage you, destroy you, wither you.
[201:55.06]But there are alternatives.
[201:57.89]Now this is a hairline that we can talk about.
[202:00.13]Time need not slow you.
[202:02.11]Tell me, have you ever considered placing yourself on display?
[202:07.15]Like, you know, you understand, if you end up with the Neelix haircut from Star Trek Voyager, it's time to get rid of it.
[202:23.15]Oh, yes.
[202:24.03]You see, I am a student of chronomancy, the magic of time alteration.
[202:31.51]Using Magicka, I will slow your heart rate, your breathing, your movement, and your thoughts until they may as well not be functioning at all.
[202:43.70]You will be perfectly preserved, taken out of time, beautiful forever.
[202:51.15]I will display you with the rest in my collection.
[202:57.02]Uh, you ain't... You're not... Okay, if I get a choice, this guy's dead.
[203:01.05]Oh.
[203:01.81]What a pity.
[203:03.49]Well, then.
[203:05.39]What is it that I can do for you?
[203:07.49]And be quick about it.
[203:08.69]Every second that passes brings us closer to our graves.
[203:14.49]This guy.
[203:15.13]That lout?
[203:16.35]Yes, he's a thorn in my side that never seems to go away.
[203:20.02]I'd have his heart on a plate if I could.
[203:24.12]I wish he'd simply disappear from the streets of New Shayoth forever.
[203:29.03]Oh, look!
[203:29.91]Just talking about it has given me another gray hair.
[203:37.71]For one thing, he's a thief.
[203:39.91]But what irks me the most is that he's a bad thief.
[203:44.62]My blood boils every time you mention Neelix.
[203:47.82]He's been caught stealing maybe a dozen times last month.
[203:51.44]Why is that?
[203:53.16]Who has time for this sort of thing?
[203:55.46]I mean, at this rate, I'll grow old and die before he's out of our air.
[204:01.56]I'll tell you what I tell anyone else who asks.
[204:04.68]Get rid of him for me and I'll make it worth your while.
[204:07.71]Do hurry.
[204:08.59]Time's wasting.
[204:10.49]Captain, I've made the most scrumptious cake.
[204:13.83]It's made from the butter from a slug from Endorf.
[204:17.31]And it is just scrumptious.
[204:19.03]Come with me and try it.
[204:20.73]Why do you hate me like so much?
[204:30.31]What does he have?
[204:31.01]He's got a thousand dollars.
[204:32.03]I'm not giving you any money.
[204:42.57]Restore agility.
[204:44.35]Damage magicka.
[204:45.27]Cure poison.
[204:45.79]Cure disease.
[204:46.45]Restore fatigue.
[204:47.41]Restore luck.
[204:54.50]Found boots.
[204:57.62]What is that?
[204:57.92]You found?
[204:59.74]You can make people stand still?
[205:06.71]Spells.
[205:07.59]I'm not a magician.
[205:09.87]I'm just a magician on my application.
[205:12.63]I'm a magician on my resume.
[205:13.91]But what happened was I took like one or two magic classes in college.
[205:20.54]But it's a resume booster.
[205:22.20]That's what it's there for.
[205:22.92]Alright.
[205:26.08]Alright.
[205:27.51]Please, come back soon.
[205:29.63]No telling what oddities I may have for you next time.
[205:34.96]Alright, let me see here.
[205:36.34]Earl has offered me a reward if I can get rid of a Brithuar.
[205:40.72]I'll need to find a way to get Brithuar to stop stealing from the shops in New Sheath.
[205:44.22]Before I make any hasty decisions, perhaps I should speak with him.
[205:50.25]I will give him a talking to.
[205:58.30]Where are you?
[205:59.54]Where's Brithar?
[206:04.90]Brithar.
[206:11.00]Where does he hang out?
[206:11.78]Brithar?
[206:12.02]That's not, what?
[206:24.94]I have a proposition for you.
[206:27.36]Best not to talk about it here.
[206:29.68]Psst.
[206:30.26]Meet me at the sewer grate northeast of the Shale-Goreth statue.
[206:36.34]Come after dark.
[206:37.88]Come alone.
[206:39.90]Okay.
[206:42.96]Wait, do I not have a quest for that?
[206:44.42]No, okay.
[206:45.58]Alright, where are you?
[206:48.02]He's probably like hanging out in some store or something.
[206:57.33]What store do you think he's in?
[206:58.71]I think he's in this store.
[207:04.36]It's his house.
[207:05.26]Can I knock on the door?
[207:12.44]No.
[207:21.31]He's in there.
[207:21.89]I have to wait until he comes out.
[207:33.26]Press the knock button.
[207:34.67]There's no knock button.
[208:04.75]Why is it not opening?
[208:21.02]What am I doing wrong?
[208:23.62]I need to know what's going on here.
[208:25.71]What have I done wrong here?
[208:33.51]No one knows how it works.
[208:36.43]Do it slower?
[208:44.66]When it's at the top.
[209:00.10]You have to wait for them to go down slow.
[209:02.52]What?
[209:06.11]Don't click it unless it goes up slowly.
[209:13.01]Okay, alright.
[209:17.80]I get you.
[209:19.12]I understand that animation.
[209:31.27]How the fuck?
[209:34.21]Oh.
[209:37.19]Alright, let's load that.
[209:56.13]How many people just learned that?
[209:58.71]That's a good question.
[209:59.53]There's the thief.
[210:02.15]You look well.
[210:04.03]Hello there.
[210:05.61]It's good to see such a well-equipped individual as yourself around these parts.
[210:09.33]Is my FPS above 60?
[210:09.97]The animation played faster than normal.
[210:11.57]It might be.
[210:12.15]But you look tired.
[210:14.13]Carrying all that gear will... We already heard you say this.
[210:19.13]Oh, how could anyone have a problem with me?
[210:22.96]Come now.
[210:25.86]What?
[210:27.30]Oh.
[210:28.74]Newcomers are entering the Shivering Isles.
[210:35.95]Do I have to do this?
[210:41.11]He hates that.
[210:42.59]He hates this, so... He doesn't like jokes.
[210:48.30]I mean, I did a little bit.
[211:03.88]I mean, what the fuck am I supposed to click here, this?
[211:06.30]You've got a point.
[211:08.89]Gracious.
[211:09.91]What a hero.
[211:12.79]That's just not funny.
[211:15.79]What nonsense.
[211:21.51]Excellent.
[211:22.97]Oh, how could... We'll see.
[211:32.70]Don't waste your flattery on me.
[211:38.82]That's amazing.
[211:41.20]How do you not like jokes?
[211:42.06]How do you not like a joke?
[211:42.94]You're a funny weirdo.
[211:45.04]That's enough.
[211:45.50]How do you not like a joke?
[211:46.56]You're a... That's just not funny.
[211:49.78]That's not bad.
[211:51.09]Oh.
[211:53.03]Alright.
[211:56.57]Excuse me.
[211:57.81]I have important things to do.
[212:00.37]Well...
[212:07.98]It's just that I like to collect things.
[212:11.76]All sorts of things.
[212:13.66]How can I be so dense?
[212:17.42]It's nothing about being dense or... It's just a stupid minigame.
[212:20.58]Flawless pearls is how to get him to stop.
[212:38.08]I may be able to use this to my advantage.
[212:40.04]I need to bring five flawless pearls to him, otherwise I may have to seek more creative or violent means.
[212:48.64]Why would I bring this guy five pearls?
[213:08.97]I have a better idea.
[213:09.61]What's the matter?
[213:20.80]Getting tired?
[213:41.44]Give me a break.
[213:43.90]The bell just rang.
[213:49.93]Okay, I'll stand.
[213:53.71]Okay, you ready?
[213:55.73]I'm ready.
[213:57.27]Sorry, he's not gonna stop.

[214:20.40]So, I have a great idea.
[214:22.51]Okay?
[214:25.03]Here's the idea.
[214:55.22]I think it's hard.
[215:02.10]Nah, I have to put him inside of the dumpster, right?
[215:03.61]I'm gonna put him in a closet.
[215:05.37]I have to hide him where nobody can find him.
[215:12.13]Oh, I can steal everything from his house too.
[215:15.55]Look, when somebody comes, just... Here, I'll slide him underneath here.
[215:20.27]What?
[215:20.59]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[215:22.07]How would you know?
[215:22.79]How would you... What?
[215:24.05]How would you see that?
[215:24.87]What are you talking about?
[215:25.79]What?
[215:26.11]Hold on.
[215:26.29]I was currently stuffing him under a bench.

[216:50.38]I can't help it
[217:23.69]What do I have that's stolen?
[217:27.59]Anything important that is going to lose me money or something?
[217:32.75]This is stolen.
[217:33.57]None of this is stolen.
[217:37.15]None of my weapons or armor have been stolen.
[217:40.75]So what did she take from me?
[217:45.46]Why did I go through all that trouble?
[217:47.38]Oh, it's rice and wheat grain.
[217:52.14]Oh, no.
[217:56.18]I thought I was protecting my sword or something.
[218:03.70]That's fine.
[218:04.38]I'll just throw it on the ground.
[218:05.24]Now I'm going to eat it.
[218:07.04]Now it's going to make it into a potion.
[218:08.40]She's not going to... Look, she's not going to know that the ingredients were used, right?
[218:16.81]Where's the stolen goods?
[218:18.27]Just turn it into something else.
[218:20.27]Rice and wheat grain.
[218:23.90]See?
[218:25.30]Now no one knows a damn thing.
[218:27.16]No one knows anything.
[218:30.40]I don't have any stolen goods now.
[218:32.30]They've been transformed.
[218:36.44]Pee.
[218:37.36]Piss.
[218:38.40]Pee on her.
[218:39.38]What are you talking about?
[218:40.99]Why did so many people just write that?
[218:44.53]Oh, it's because I'm... This is like from five minutes ago.
[218:47.13]I scrolled.
[218:47.57]I forgot.
[218:48.13]Sorry.
[218:54.48]I can't get it back.
[218:59.15]Alright, I'm gonna drink that.
[219:00.07]No, I'm not.
[219:01.57]So, let's save it here.
[219:03.21]Sure.
[219:03.97]I will.
[219:29.86]Oh, fuck, this is his bed.
[219:30.94]No, I'm not... I don't... I want to leave his house.
[219:41.97]Fuck.
[219:42.23]God!
[219:49.89]You think you could escape Lord Sheogorath's justice?
[219:54.27]Your stolen goods are now forfeit, and your...
[219:57.96]You didn't take any of my shit, did you?
[220:23.45]Make sure all my shit is still here.
[220:24.90]All my expensive stuff.
[220:26.08]That's all I care about.
[220:26.80]That's the only thing I care about is my expensive things.
[220:36.92]Let's go complete this quest.
[220:39.90]He's literally right here.
[220:44.07]Eat his heart, dress up as him, and talk to the guard.
[220:46.25]That's how you become him.
[220:49.84]Hey, I figured it out!
[220:51.75]Well...
[221:04.49]Here's his heart.
[221:05.05]Steal his shit?

[221:37.68]Friend.
[221:38.28]Okay.
[221:39.50]I want to buy one of these.
[221:41.42]Revive?
[221:42.86]Jesus.
[221:45.68]Summon hunger.
[221:46.61]Summon voracious hunger.
[221:47.95]Rejuvenate.
[221:54.73]Remedy.
[221:57.03]Restore 10 health points for 2 seconds.
[222:01.44]So you restore 20 health.
[222:07.91]Alright.
[222:08.47]Hold on.
[222:08.71]Let me get out of here for a second.
[222:10.48]I need to save and then I have to quit because I can't see the goddamn chat because I can't... Maybe I can do it.
[222:21.18]Let's see.
[222:22.64]This is from like 10 full minutes ago.
[222:24.42]Alright.
[222:25.90]I'm good.
[222:26.10]Alright.
[222:28.77]I can now see everything.
[222:29.47]Did I do it in time?
[222:30.17]Come on.
[222:30.67]No crash.
[222:31.05]Good.
[222:31.21]Alright.
[222:36.98]I need to sleep.
[222:37.54]Did I level up again?
[222:38.18]So that quest is complete.
[222:42.18]I will do that now.
[222:45.95]Yes, you've leveled up.
[222:47.27]Wink.
[222:47.37]Why would you wink?
[223:10.92]Did I level up?
[223:12.58]Or am I getting winked at here?
[223:14.12]Okay, after midnight, right?
[223:20.86]So let's just sleep for like seven hours.
[223:26.04]You guys lied to me.
[223:26.64]I didn't level up.
[223:29.97]Alright, let's get it to like four hours and then let's go meet him after dark.
[223:40.68]You need to sleep for eight hours.
[223:41.72]That's not true.
[223:47.84]So, let's see what we have to do now.
[223:52.85]What do you got for me, buddy?
[223:53.79]Hi.
[224:01.63]I'm glad you came.
[224:03.60]So, are you interested in earning some loot?
[224:10.74]No.
[224:10.92]What is it?
[224:12.16]I thought we were in Mania.
[224:40.60]Retching up falling asleep or screaming screaming.
[224:44.28]It's someone who doesn't deserve it.
[224:45.94]I'm just so fed up with it all I'm sorry having a bad day.
[224:53.10]So what what's this to me?
[224:55.00]Why don't Jesus?
[224:56.38]Oh my god These are very different distinct horrible I'm sorry having a bad day
[225:09.28]A bad day?
[225:10.58]Jesus.
[225:11.16]Try a miserable existence.
[225:15.34]There's no point in talking about it.
[225:17.92]Action must be taken.
[225:19.44]I have to kill this guy?
[225:20.56]You must.
[225:22.81]I need you to kill me.
[225:24.97]Oh my god.
[225:25.87]I don't have any other options.
[225:35.75]You're not gonna give me like any other options here?
[225:41.98]Have you seen those miserable souls on the hill of suicides?
[225:46.29]Do you think that kind of existence is any better than this?
[225:50.93]No.
[225:52.23]You must kill me.
[225:56.83]What?
[225:58.31]There's no other... Where's my personality?
[226:01.13]Charisma trope, where I can... There's two other options.
[226:05.32]I don't necessarily want to see it coming.
[226:08.19]And I want to die here in the city so all these people finally believe me.
[226:13.07]They'll wish they were nicer.
[226:15.87]You probably want to do it without spectators, though.
[226:18.88]What the fuck?
[226:19.68]You don't get in trouble.
[226:21.86]Best to make it look like an accident.
[226:25.24]But remember, I don't want to see it.
[226:29.24]Uh, so what, how, how do we proceed after this?
[226:37.27]Well, that's up to you, I suppose.
[226:39.23]I'm going to go about my daily life such as it is, as if nothing has changed.
[226:46.06]Make your move when you wish, but please do it soon.
[226:49.48]You just want me to kill you at a random time?
[226:54.74]Just come up behind you and just, like, stab you?
[226:57.42]Oh, that.
[227:00.27]When you kill me, take the key to my house.
[227:03.23]Jewelry box?
[227:03.99]Nothing really worth taking, except what's locked up in the jewelry box.
[227:07.73]You can have that.
[227:08.48]Okay.
[227:10.20]What the fuck?
[227:11.54]I'm going to pretend everything is normal.
[227:14.76]Make your move as soon as you can, but let me get away first so I don't know what's coming.
[227:21.22]Please don't!
[227:23.50]What?
[227:27.20]You're fucking this up right now.
[227:29.14]I didn't... That's probably the last thing you should do here, is what you're doing right now.
[227:40.83]Alright.
[227:44.39]Stop!
[227:45.31]Take me unaware!
[227:46.67]Not like this!
[227:47.51]What are you talking... I didn't do anything.
[227:48.89]How may I serve?
[227:52.97]Please don't!
[228:04.34]Where's his house?
[228:07.93]Should I just go like turn the gas on in his house?
[228:10.93]No, I'm not doing this one.
[228:12.41]I'm not gonna do this one.
[228:13.37]I'm gonna go into his house and steal the jewelry out of his box.
[228:17.21]And then I'm gonna use that money to go like pay for somebody to like help this guy.
[228:30.43]Where's his house?
[228:35.84]I murdered a random guy earlier.
[228:37.44]No, I didn't.
[228:39.62]I murdered a bad guy that steals.
[228:43.76]That wanted me to get five perfect Diablo II sapphires.
[228:47.77]No thanks.
[228:51.01]I mean, I ripped his heart out too.
[228:52.25]That was a bad guy.
[228:53.93]This guy's just down on his luck.
[228:56.09]Here, watch.
[228:57.83]No, I wanna do the... I just wanna know where his house is.
[229:16.85]Kill NPC for funny moments, but won't kill this guy.
[229:25.39]no not like this this is different though this is different no he didn't do anything wrong please no no not like this
[230:02.11]I didn't do it.
[230:03.33]I just... I think he saw it.
[230:22.34]No.
[230:22.84]I didn't want... I just need the experience.
[230:25.14]I'm only level 3.
[230:37.19]How do I bury him?
[230:48.70]Where's his house?
[230:49.28]I just want to get this over with.
[230:55.60]I need to level up.
[230:56.98]I need some more points.
[231:00.49]Where's his house?
[231:02.17]That's not his house.
[231:06.48]and you buried him in the sewer.
[231:11.81]Stop making me feel worse about this.
[231:38.33]Alright, what does he have here?
[231:39.55]There's the lockbox.
[231:52.98]Feather 25 points on Slight 5 points on Waterwalking Fortify Personality.
[232:03.12]Here's the will.
[232:04.82]Okay, I've claimed my reward.
[232:10.34]Hold on, wait, I gotta put, like, this... This is his, like, last resting place, right?
[232:14.14]I gotta put something here.
[232:27.98]Where is... Okay, we're gonna put his clothes in here.
[232:38.74]And...
[232:47.70]I don't have his heart.
[232:54.09]And we're gonna put his key in here, too.
[232:56.09]Right?
[232:56.51]That's like the... That's the right thing to do.
[232:58.17]I don't think I have it anymore.
[233:01.95]There it is.
[233:03.90]Okay.
[233:05.02]So there... See?
[233:10.42]We put his clothes in here and his key.
[233:14.93]Let's read his will.
[233:23.65]Uh, want to die.
[233:24.79]Things aren't going right.
[233:25.89]Never have gone right, really.
[233:26.97]No one seems to care either, nor even I. It's not that I have had much to say.
[233:29.94]Even if someone had wanted me to be my friend, I'd make a lousy friend anyway.
[233:33.14]Probably even boring, the person reading this.
[233:34.60]I'm certainly boring.
[233:35.46]Not that anyone will ever find this.
[233:38.22]If they do, it means that I've been granted my greatest wish to be rel- Jeez, this is fucking horrible!
[233:42.29]Uh... All I really have is... ...a little ring.
[233:54.75]A wizard gave it to me once.
[233:57.00]Said I reminded him of his stuff.
[233:59.66]Okay, this is actually, like... This is actually fucking horrible.
[234:06.98]I think the thing is worthless.
[234:10.81]I tried it for a while.
[234:12.23]The happiness ring.
[234:31.26]That's some deep shit here, man.
[234:34.58]Jesus.
[234:55.50]I pushed him.
[234:56.26]I didn't... I didn't... The experience point.
[235:07.31]I have a flashlight.
[235:08.27]I can walk on water.
[235:23.86]I don't know what this stuff is, but I'm going to take it.
[235:28.86]Is there anything else I can get put in here?
[235:30.32]I didn't loot his house.
[235:39.68]He told me to come loot his house.
[235:41.76]No, not loot his house.
[235:43.08]Take things from... I'm just realizing the inside of these houses.
[235:51.05]Look at the walls.
[235:57.33]the clothes yeah I put that look I put his clothes in here and then his key and I'm gonna do another one I'm gonna put in yeah there was those it was that stuff wasn't it stealing isn't this guy's inheritance alright so you know how games have choices right
[236:28.65]Oh, choices matter.
[236:31.91]That is... You're talking about like a deep fucking horrible thing.
[236:41.94]That's... That's tough.
[236:44.68]That's not... Plus five evil points.
[236:57.71]I can see now... Well, that's that completed.
[237:11.29]Chat will remember that.
[237:12.65]Where... Alright.
[237:16.29]I found the Matrix.
[237:17.49]Sickly Bernice.
[237:21.93]So I have to go find, uh... At the bottom of Naughty Bramble.
[237:27.25]Wasn't I already in here?
[237:30.43]No, so it's down here.
[237:31.45]I can't fast travel.
[237:33.21]Fuck, I can't fast travel over here.
[237:38.43]Is there one that's closer?
[237:39.35]I found a matrix.
[237:48.02]Okay, somebody in the crucible.
[237:49.88]I can do this.
[237:50.40]I can bring the matrix to somebody.
[237:57.27]I should ask around.
[237:58.37]Someone in the Shivering Isles must know what this is used for.
[238:06.29]Someone here must know what it's used for.
[238:08.09]I don't really have a marker, though.
[238:18.04]Palace.
[238:20.60]Let's go over here.
[238:21.16]Let's go this way.
[238:24.88]I want to go to the palace.
[238:38.07]We've done a couple of side quests.
[238:39.31]I guess I could do, like, the actual mission, right?
[238:47.59]Go to the gosh dang palace.
[238:50.72]I am making my way there.
[238:56.46]Oh, god damn it.
[238:57.92]Like, no.
[239:00.49]Why?
[239:01.03]Why are you there still?
[239:02.61]Ugh!
[239:19.73]Found the palace.
[239:24.19]I need a new weapon.
[239:25.13]An actual weapon.
[239:25.89]I probably should have gone to the... The thing there.
[239:30.58]Alright, give me one minute.
[239:35.84]I'm going to go pee one more time.
[239:39.92]Hopefully the game does not crash.
[239:41.04]I'm going to see if I can make it not happen.
[239:45.54]See if I can quickly do it.
[239:46.62]Alright, see you in a minute.
[242:46.74]I'm such a fucking idiot.
[242:51.41]I bought a turkey sandwich earlier.
[242:54.65]Specifically to have in the fridge.
[242:59.70]So after I was done streaming, I was gonna go up and just eat it.
[243:02.08]Like, make sure to have it, because it's hard to, you know, I've been, um, obviously putting pots and pans away and not really cooking that much the last few days.
[243:13.37]And, yeah.
[243:15.81]Unfortunately.
[243:18.10]I left it in the car.
[243:22.24]Just a full turkey sandwich in the front seat of the fucking car.
[243:29.67]I just didn't even bring the mouse.
[243:37.95]You have no idea how sad this is making me.
[243:46.35]I bought it specifically.
[243:50.24]It's still fine?
[243:51.74]Ah, I don't know, man.
[243:53.80]It is so hot and humid in Massachusetts right now.
[243:57.94]There was a monsoon earlier.
[244:01.66]It's so hot and muggy, the inside of that car.
[244:05.01]Oh, no.
[244:05.53]I bought it like five hours ago.
[244:11.29]Like six hours ago now.
[244:13.35]Had to have
[244:20.77]Looks like we're eating bread tonight.
[244:23.67]Good old plain bread.
[244:24.93]That's what I'm talking about.
[244:26.77]Fermented food is good for- Fermented turkey is not good for you.
[244:40.00]There he is.
[245:05.35]I can't move.
[245:05.95]Okay.
[245:18.21]That's it.
[245:22.49]Holy shit.
[245:24.89]Wait, hold on.
[245:25.35]I have a potion for this.
[245:26.21]I have a potion.
[245:26.67]I think I have a potion, don't I?
[245:45.25]Hold on.
[245:55.05]Well, look who's... You really shouldn't have done that.
[245:58.92]Enjoy them.
[246:42.62]No, no, turn this all off.
[246:44.12]Stop doing this.
[246:44.80]Hold on, I think I might be able to get it.
[246:49.31]Alright, we're good.
[247:09.16]Okay.
[247:21.95]Oh, well.
[247:23.94]Alright, what do you want, Scrooge McDuck?
[247:27.68]You really shouldn't have done that.
[247:28.82]Well, look who's here.
[247:30.84]You.
[247:32.76]How about that?
[247:33.74]Always a pleasure.
[247:38.40]Yes, is there something you require?
[247:42.83]What about those gates?
[247:43.31]This looks like muscle tissue.
[247:43.93]It looks like his head was exploded at one point, and then it re-grew from the hole where the explosion happened.
[247:48.79]Disgusting, revolting.
[248:14.04]A glorious... A new arrival!
[248:17.62]Shame about my gatekeeper.
[248:19.90]I'm so happy I could just tear out your intestines and strangle you with them!
[248:28.21]I suppose an introduction is in order.
[248:32.25]I'm Sheogorath, Prince of Madness!
[248:37.99]And other things.
[248:40.25]I'm not talking about them.
[248:44.26]You've probably figured that out by now.
[248:46.62]Let's hope so.
[248:47.54]We're enraged.
[248:49.96]And out come the intestines.
[248:52.99]And I skip rope with them.
[248:58.71]But perhaps now's not the time.
[249:01.61]You've made it this far, farther than anyone else.
[249:04.39]Well done.
[249:05.81]Take this trinket of mine.
[249:08.66]Perhaps it will serve you well.
[249:11.00]Or look lovely on your corpse.
[249:16.35]Charity of Madness.
[249:17.55]What do you want?
[249:18.25]I've been waiting for you.
[249:19.67]For someone like you.
[249:21.93]For someone other than you, for some time.
[249:24.72]I need a champion, and you've got the job!
[249:30.18]Time to save the realm!
[249:32.56]Rescue the damsel!
[249:34.15]Slay the beast!
[249:36.67]Or die.
[249:37.39]Try.
[249:38.31]Slay.
[249:39.77]Your help is required.
[249:40.83]Save the realm.
[249:42.75]A change is coming.
[249:44.86]Everything changes.
[249:46.80]Even Daedric Princess.
[249:49.18]Especially Daedric Princess.
[249:53.10]Daedric Princess?
[249:56.15]Oh, okay.
[249:57.13]My eyes weren't on the screen.
[249:59.19]I thought I was saying day drinking.
[250:02.71]I tell you, man, she drinks a lot.
[250:04.23]She's always shit-faced.
[250:05.21]Daedric Princess.
[250:06.73]I was looking over here.
[250:10.16]Adra are the embodiment of change.
[250:12.27]Change and permanency.
[250:13.75]That wasn't a joke.
[250:15.09]That's what I heard.
[250:15.85]I was looking over here.
[250:18.03]A gray march is coming.
[250:19.97]And you're going to stop it.
[250:26.64]The details aren't important.
[250:28.16]At least, not right now.
[250:30.04]Eternity is on a rather tight deadline.
[250:31.56]We'll get back to that later.
[250:39.71]Now, you run an errand for me.
[250:42.65]An important one, of course.
[250:45.22]Anything I tell you to do is important.
[250:49.54]My realm, my rules!
[250:53.87]You're going to Zedillion.
[250:56.19]Zedillion.
[250:56.57]One of my favorite spots in the Isles.
[250:59.49]It's a little place I used to take care of unwanted visitors.
[251:04.09]I'm so defeated and drained.
[251:05.73]And some are more unwanted than others.
[251:09.07]All the energy got sapped out of me when I heard that my turkey sandwich in the front seat is unedible because I didn't take it out of the cart.
[251:15.93]A gatekeeper takes care of most of the unwanted.
[251:18.05]I'm so upset about that.
[251:19.30]But he's dead.
[251:21.85]order something it's 10 30 I can't do that now anyway there are those that have other ways into my realm and they're on the move I want to go to Burger King or something here trust me so you're going to get zedillion up and running here's a little book to tell you how and the attenuator of judgment uh you'll need that too
[251:47.11]Of course, you can always get more details from Haskell.
[251:50.69]He's a detail-oriented type of person.
[251:53.07]A big help.
[251:54.77]Get a Texas double whopper.
[251:56.13]That sounds really good.
[251:58.31]Now, get going before I change my mind.
[252:02.02]Or my mind changes me.
[252:07.32]Alright.
[252:07.72]A better mousetrap.
[252:09.10]Manual of Zedelian added.
[252:12.95]We got a lot of random items here.
[252:16.00]Alright, what do you got for me?
[252:20.94]Burger King bacon is usually five hours old at least when served.
[252:31.38]Gross.
[252:32.48]Yeah, but those are loaded with preservatives.
[252:36.82]They inject those bacon strips with acid to make it so they don't ever decompose.
[252:49.27]A little busy here.
[252:51.47]I'm trying to decide what to have for dinner.
[252:53.69]I love eating.
[252:55.41]One of my favorite things to do.
[252:58.57]Talk to Haskell if you need more information.
[253:00.97]He's got more brains than a brain pie.
[253:04.31]Oh, brain pie.
[253:07.57]Perfect.
[253:08.25]I'd eat that right now.
[253:09.91]Care to donate?
[253:10.97]What if there was a yes?
[253:15.43]You can go now.
[253:16.37]Run along, scoot.
[253:22.10]Well, I mean, you know when you've made it and you're super rich and super powerful when you have, not only do you have nacho cheese flavored fire, but you also got cool ranch.
[253:32.34]Always a pleasure.
[253:34.78]That's next level for me.
[253:35.92]Alright, let's go.
[253:40.82]I'm not gonna attack him again.
[253:41.92]I hate you.
[253:46.22]What?
[253:46.80]It's true.
[253:47.94]You know, that's gonna cost a lot of money.
[253:52.08]Let's take a look.
[253:52.74]I've been given the manual of Zedillion and a strange device called an Attunator of Judgment by Shigurath.
[254:01.30]She's called Shigo from now on.
[254:03.67]I've been directed to proceed to Zedillion and to return the place to working order.
[254:08.99]I should either read the manual or speak to Shigurath's chamberlain, Haskell, to familiarize myself with the strange dungeon.
[254:15.51]I might as well just ask her.
[254:21.19]The Mad God has given you a task.
[254:23.73]Surely someone of your copious talent should be able to handle it?
[254:27.26]Maybe.
[254:29.60]Yes, quite an amazing place, really.
[254:31.98]Wonderful for relieving one's tension as you watch those troublesome adventurers suffer.
[254:36.94]She-O-Gor-Rath.
[254:38.06]No offense.
[254:39.80]I'd say your next move is to head to Zedillion and get it reactivated.
[254:43.71]Am I from Boston?
[254:45.01]Uh, yes.
[254:55.66]The Shivering Isles is what Sheogorath wills it to be.
[254:59.04]I was born in Boston.
[255:02.52]A glorious existence.
[255:05.14]And since being a teenager into my adult life, I have moved a couple of times.
[255:18.75]And I'm moving again.
[255:21.04]To Las Vegas.
[255:21.90]I'm no longer going to be... Oh, where are you from?
[255:24.08]Oh, I'm from... Well, I mean, I guess I'm originally from... Boston, but... Now I have to say... Oh, I'm... Where do you live?
[255:32.36]Oh, Boston.
[255:33.04]No, I can't... No, that's not right.
[255:34.30]It's Las Vegas.
[255:38.76]Let's open the manual.
[255:39.78]What do you say?
[255:43.20]I've learned that in order to...
[255:46.13]Fucking turkey sandwich is ruining my life.
[255:48.47]I've learned that in order to restore Sedelian, I must activate the Resonator of Judgment.
[255:53.32]To do so, I will need to find three focus crystals and place them in each- I'm eating it on stream.
[255:57.74]I'm trying it on stream.
[255:58.96]I'll be right back.
[256:03.54]I need to find these to place them in each dungeon which will prepare the resonator for a tomb.
[256:07.74]I should proceed to Zdillion now and begin my search.
[256:09.51]Okay.
[256:10.47]We'll make that the quest.
[256:12.33]And I'm just going to save it here.
[256:14.81]I'm going to take a bite on stream and see what happens.
[256:19.39]Just give me a minute.
[256:19.91]I'm just going to smell it.
[256:22.74]We're going to open it together.
[256:25.52]And I'll give it a go.
[256:26.52]I'm going to smell it on stream.
[256:28.52]I'm going to smell it on stream.
[256:30.02]Just wait.
[257:47.51]What?
[259:13.21]Alright.
[259:17.01]Let's see.
[259:44.88]Sandwich Adam.
[259:46.26]Oh, this is so... I hate this, because if I can't eat this, then it looks so good.
[259:53.44]Hold on.
[259:59.80]Ugh!
[260:04.28]It doesn't need to look okay.
[260:05.98]This is all you need.
[260:06.62]It doesn't matter how ugly this looks.
[260:08.28]What's going on with the camp?
[260:11.46]Why am I lagging?
[260:14.76]Why is the stream lagging?
[260:22.98]I have to quit this game.
[260:24.90]I gotta quit.
[260:29.03]This is important.
[260:34.61]Okay.
[260:35.87]So.
[260:38.84]Here it is.
[260:42.29]It's wet.
[260:44.07]Water is coming off of this thing.
[260:49.23]I can't eat this.
[260:55.95]God, look at this.
[260:57.87]Look at how good this looks.
[261:00.49]That's turkey, that's cranberry, that's stuffing.
[261:10.85]Oh, I want to eat it.
[261:11.63]You know when you're in the video game and you know the food's rotten and you kind of don't care?
[261:17.51]There's like mayonnaise on here.
[261:19.61]I have like the rotten food in my inventory and you know me, I'll eat it.
[261:22.90]Look at how good that is.
[261:28.92]It's perfect.
[261:31.44]How long has it been out there for?
[261:32.54]It's been out there for, what is it, 10.30?
[261:35.74]Almost 11?
[261:39.30]11, 10, nine, eight, seven, six.
[261:42.53]It's been out there for like five and a half hours, six hours.
[261:50.37]And it's been outside in the hot fucking humid car.
[261:55.47]It was like 98% humidity today.
[262:10.75]No.
[262:12.43]Nope.
[262:16.76]I might just be freaking... I gotta take a solid bite.
[262:20.34]I might be freaking myself out about this.
[262:21.84]There's mayo on here.
[262:22.64]Hold on.
[262:32.07]It's so good, but at the same time, it's bad.
[262:38.49]Okay, hold on.
[262:42.11]I just want to like taste it.
[262:45.69]I just need to taste it.
[262:52.78]God damn it.
[262:54.92]Damn it.
[262:55.28]This is so angering me.
[263:02.44]I'm so fucking angry.
[263:11.71]It's off.
[263:16.05]Somebody just texted me, what the hell?
[263:19.09]Nothing.
[263:20.87]Why didn't I eat it earlier?
[263:22.13]Because I bought it specifically to put in the fridge after the stream.
[263:26.01]And when I got in the car, I drove back from, I did a couple of errands, I had some stuff to do today, and then I just forgot it was in the front seat.
[263:34.83]It was like a baby in the front seat.
[263:37.33]Whatever.
[263:38.77]And I just didn't take the fucking sandwich inside, because I was on the phone with somebody.
[263:47.52]that sucks well yeah it's it's not it's like the cranberries in there and the mayonnaise in there is just not not working oh I'm so I'm everything about this is making me unhappy what a waste
[264:17.17]Don't ever forget your sandwich in the car.
[264:22.15]I don't even want it in the room anymore.
[264:23.57]It's going to taunt me.
[264:25.11]Is he going to cry?
[264:26.01]Maybe because I can't, I, now I have to go eat like bread and butter.
[264:33.54]Slow down.
[264:34.08]It's water.
[264:39.36]Cook it.
[264:41.78]Let me cook it.
[264:43.49]How do you cook a cold sandwich?
[264:46.58]What am I going to do?
[264:48.16]Like put it in the pan?
[264:49.14]Put it in the microwave for like two minutes?
[264:54.13]Put it in the toaster oven?
[264:55.31]You don't... You do know that it takes two full minutes in a microwave to kill germs.
[264:59.47]You know that, right?
[265:02.87]In a microwave, this is just two minutes.
[265:05.09]You're not going to do it for that long.
[265:13.00]Put it in the microwave for two minutes?
[265:14.76]No, it will be unedible.
[265:17.40]I'm going to put it in the fridge right now.
[265:20.39]And I'm going to fucking try again later.
[265:22.09]Maybe all the diseases will be out of it.
[265:31.53]Freeze it.
[265:32.38]I'm going to put it in the freezer.
[265:33.42]That's a good idea.
[265:35.22]I'm going to put it in the freezer.
[265:36.44]It'll freeze out all the bacteria.
[265:38.58]And it'll kill everything.
[265:40.26]And then after I have the freezer, I'm going to boil it in water.
[265:43.90]And then I'm going to take it out of the boiling water.
[265:45.33]And then I'm going to microwave it for 10 seconds.
[265:51.33]That's not how a freezer works.
[265:52.47]Yeah, it's going to slow down, it's going to freeze the germs.
[265:57.35]And then I'm going to freeze the germs, and then they're going to wake up after being boiled, after chronogenic freezing, they're going to all die in the boiling water.
[266:03.00]It's going to be like a flash fry.
[266:05.44]Pull it out, microwave 10 seconds, and then just close my eyes and eat it.
[266:13.77]I'm so upset right now.
[266:16.65]I'm going to put this in the fridge.
[266:18.68]And I'm going to have like a doctor come over and test it tomorrow.
[266:25.33]Eat the sandwich right now.
[266:26.31]Just hold on.
[266:31.31]Give me one second.
[266:34.75]Just hold on.
[266:42.90]I'm freaking out.
[266:43.54]It's five hours.
[266:46.60]It tastes off.
[266:49.43]Remember, this is not five hours on the kitchen counter.
[266:52.13]This is five hours in like a hot, humid car.
[266:58.79]If it was sitting like up on the kitchen counter, that's a different story.
[267:04.31]It was in the front seat of the car all the rest of the day, like the last six plus hours.
[267:14.64]If you eat it, you're gonna die.
[267:16.84]Just eat, you know, I could probably pull stuff from it.
[267:21.52]People eat food out of dumpsters?
[267:26.94]Have a Subway employee come and look at it.
[267:32.69]Your fan base is trying to kill you.
[267:35.15]You see this?
[267:35.91]I don't know.
[267:37.27]Half of you guys are saying, just eat it.
[267:40.25]You'll be fine.
[267:40.91]And the other half are like, you're going to die if you eat this.
[267:44.38]Now, I know it's not that extreme, but I have to, like, fucking move real soon.
[267:50.49]I got a lot of shit to do over the next two days.
[267:52.59]I'm putting all... I'm shipping my whole house tomorrow.
[267:56.03]I can't have, like, every 10-minute diarrhea tomorrow.
[267:59.67]I can't.
[268:01.19]I can't do that.
[268:01.93]Alright, let's... What were we doing?
[268:11.27]We were playing Oblivion.
[268:16.21]And yeah, that's true.
[268:17.89]I also have an intestinal disease.
[268:20.81]So that's just the perfect storm of awful things that could happen to my body.
[268:31.22]My colitis will probably go insane if I eat this.
[268:35.06]I just wish I was a doctor.
[268:40.04]I would be able to know.
[268:51.47]I'll take the risk.
[268:52.23]God damn it.
[268:55.45]Whatever.
[268:55.81]This is sad.
[269:02.68]Yeah, so I'll put it... Yeah, that's right.
[269:04.38]That's a good idea.
[269:04.92]I'm going to put it in the fridge.
[269:06.28]I'm going to go to medical school.
[269:08.04]And then when I graduate medical school in seven years, I'll take it out and see if it's worth it.
[269:15.29]How may I serve?
[269:16.51]Alright, but I actually do have to put this upstairs.
[269:21.08]This is going to just cause me anxiety and anger.
[269:26.72]Alright, I'll be right back again.
[269:28.02]I'm literally just running up the stairs to put this into the freezer.
[269:32.41]I'm not going to eat it.
[269:36.83]I'm not going to eat it.
[269:37.39]I might.
[269:37.87]I might not, though.
[269:38.63]I probably won't.
[270:33.75]Okay, like, no, I'm not gonna say it, that's disgusting.
[270:42.15]Don't eat it if it has mayo.
[270:45.07]It's basically a barely aged sandwich.
[270:46.95]I know, there's going to be a debate in here for the next, like, four hours about this.
[270:52.23]Twitch staff said it was okay.
[270:58.64]Yeah, it's not the mayo, it's not, look, it has nothing to do with shelf life or being out.
[271:05.04]I've eaten shit that's been on the counter for more than six plus hours before, right?
[271:11.20]It was... Does Spencer know that this was inside of a hot car for six hours?
[271:19.56]Humid.
[271:21.24]It was like 98 degrees.
[271:23.26]Not 98% humidity today.
[271:28.07]So it was extra cooked.
[271:29.47]No, that's like bacteria.
[271:33.29]No, listen.
[271:34.83]It's gonna be fine.
[271:35.51]I freezed it.
[271:37.09]I put it in the freezer.
[271:37.79]I'm gonna take it out and I'm gonna fucking blend it up.
[271:41.24]I'm gonna boil it and then I'm gonna blend it to, you know, scramble up all the bacteria.
[271:45.44]Then I'm gonna fucking put that blended up mixture into the freezer again.
[271:49.57]And I'm gonna have like a fucking turkey sandwich popsicle.
[272:00.84]I hope you don't eat it.
[272:12.43]Just go put it back in the hot human car.
[272:23.34]Go refund it because of my own incompetence?
[272:32.65]If you microwave it, all the bacteria dies, but you have to microwave... I actually looked this up, because I had, like, 12-day-old food that were leftovers, and I was scared to eat it, because it didn't look right, didn't smell right either.
[272:45.02]And I looked this up.
[272:46.39]It is two full minutes in a microwave, or you do not kill the bacteria.
[272:54.61]Okay, refunding food from seven hours ago is you ate that food and now you're coming in and asking for them to charge back the card.
[273:06.00]Hey, thank you for the sandwich.
[273:07.14]Alright.
[273:07.48]Thank you.
[273:08.66]Come back in seven hours later.
[273:10.48]I want a refund on that sandwich.
[273:21.31]Where did you read that?
[273:22.17]The Daily Mail?
[273:23.17]No.
[273:23.75]Just type it in.
[273:25.45]How long do I need to microwave to kill bacteria?
[273:28.38]Two minutes.
[273:30.78]Just say you found a hair.
[273:33.04]I'm not going to be a dickhead about this.
[273:37.38]What am I looking for?
[273:38.02]Alright.
[273:44.63]I'm standing right next to it.
[273:47.81]Hi!
[273:48.11]Hi!
[274:03.70]Buy another sandwich, leave, go back with the smelly, gross sandwich.
[274:08.36]So you're talking about go buy a turkey sandwich from this place, leave, come back into the restaurant with the gross sandwich, and say I'd like to return this.
[274:26.64]No, man.
[274:28.80]I feel a little weird.
[274:30.70]I might be freaking out right now, but my mouth hurts.
[274:33.83]The bacteria got in my mouth and it's starting to decompose my brain.
[274:36.68]I gotta go brush my teeth.
[274:50.23]Returned in its popsicle form.
[274:52.95]Where am I going?
[274:56.35]But wait, where am I actually going?
[275:11.32]Nara Bark.
[275:11.98]Okay.
[275:13.85]I actually want to know what the hell I'm doing here.
[275:15.25]Because it was just on the map.
[275:18.83]Activate the Resonator of Judgment.
[275:21.23]Free Focus Crystals.
[275:26.05]That's not my marker.
[275:27.27]Okay, I'm just an imbecile.
[275:28.85]Okay?
[275:35.74]If I bring that sandwich to Vegas, you'll eat it.
[275:39.46]No, I'm not gonna bring the sandwich to Las Vegas.
[275:48.84]There's also something in here.
[275:50.54]So, I'll do that one first.
[275:59.05]If I'm reading this, I've been known.
[276:06.77]Take a road trip with the sandwich.
[276:17.26]Leave the sandwich out for a year.
[276:18.62]Eventually all the bacteria will encompass it and it'll go back to zero.
[276:23.81]Or a hundred.
[276:25.85]And it'll just be a green piece of bread.
[276:32.71]So I gotta go this way.
[276:35.93]Does this wrap?
[276:36.41]Yeah, it does.
[276:45.84]Now, what'll happen, guys, is that sandwich... It'll start on the sandwich, and then it'll go over and go into the sink.
[276:57.73]I will have a green bacteria kitchen.
[277:01.84]Really soon, if I do that.
[277:16.79]It's a free garden kitchen.
[277:19.93]Well, that wouldn't be a garden.
[277:22.63]It would be a bacteria disease kitchen.
[277:27.89]I made myself a sandwich because of you.
[277:29.69]Hey, don't!
[277:35.38]The thing is, though, it's gonna be okay.
[277:37.30]Because I think there are still some chicken sausages that I can cook.
[277:42.38]So I should be alright.
[277:43.28]I mean, I might have to eat bread after all.
[277:47.76]I did, too.
[277:48.38]Well, you saw how good that looked.
[277:54.98]A turkey gobbler sandwich is my favorite thing on Earth.
[278:01.21]Cranberry, stuffing, mayo, turkey.
[278:05.19]It's my favorite thing ever, and I was so happy.
[278:10.19]Somebody gave... It was like a Christmas present when I took it from the guy.
[278:14.77]It looked gross.
[278:15.69]Ban that guy forever.
[278:16.45]Permanently.
[278:20.29]That's a full life sentence there.
[278:37.45]A life sentence, that's ten seconds.
[278:39.23]I think I found it.
[278:45.68]Can I jump in the volcano?
[279:07.67]I feel like I'm just surfing.
[279:13.58]Well, here it is.
[279:14.90]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[279:26.83]Lie?
[279:27.05]What am I lying on stream?
[279:28.13]What did I lie?
[279:28.61]What do you mean, lie?
[279:32.45]What was a lie?
[279:39.83]I can't think without that sandwich.
[279:43.21]I've entered the Naughty Bramble.
[279:44.33]I should make my way carefully to the pool.
[279:46.59]Sickly Bernice spoke of and recover a sample of Aquanostrum.
[279:52.66]Yep.
[279:54.04]That's what I'm gonna do.
[280:01.90]I'm so paranoid about that.
[280:02.92]It's like the new sandwich is the FOV.
[280:17.33]Amber Stump.
[280:18.15]Let's go to the local map.
[280:21.47]If you could, since it's in here.
[280:33.24]Heavy armor.
[280:36.21]Out of here.
[280:44.84]Start a GoFundMe for the sandwich.
[280:47.02]You know, it wasn't expensive, but that just stinks, you know what I mean?
[281:06.91]Scrape off the mayo.
[281:09.71]Thank you, Internet Jorge, for your $15 and your... just scrape off the mayo.
[281:18.64]The roots will not budge.
[281:20.54]I'll probably have to deactivate them somehow.
[281:24.68]No, I'm locked in here.
[281:25.50]That was the way I came.
[281:26.64]Fucking sandwich.
[281:27.62]Got me all twisted.
[281:30.80]Alright.
[281:32.16]Where the hell am I going?
[281:39.78]Deactivate the roots.
[281:40.68]Yeah.
[281:41.16]There's probably a button I pressed.
[282:01.65]What the fuck?
[282:04.05]I am trying to take everything.
[282:05.69]I gotta make my alchemy go up a little higher.
[282:07.55]Alright, well, hey, look.
[282:08.13]Deactivate the roots.
[282:14.90]I guess not.
[282:21.75]It's definitely a switch.
[282:22.65]What was that?
[282:32.52]Almost got me.
[282:35.94]I think I'm so absent-minded that I didn't get hit by that.
[282:44.30]Noclip.
[282:46.16]I told you this already.
[282:47.22]When not... Once you go bath that... You go... You take a bath.
[282:52.59]And when you recuperate and you relax a little bit, you get out and then you go down the path that you cannot return from.
[282:58.45]I'm not cheating.
[282:59.99]I didn't even want to pick that up.
[283:17.08]Once I type in TCL, my friends, that's where playing this game ends.
[283:26.90]It ends there.
[283:28.00]Because then I'm going to think something's funny, and I'm not going to want to play the regular game anymore.
[283:37.01]Let's begin with potions.
[283:40.23]Let's go ahead and open this up.
[283:43.38]So ingredients, black tar, which is damage fatigue, damage speed.
[283:50.10]Why would you, why would I want this?
[283:55.75]I don't know what that would even be for.
[283:57.09]Alright.
[284:00.19]Restore strength.
[284:05.81]Restore magicka.
[284:06.69]Here we go.
[284:07.25]Come on.
[284:07.65]Give me a big one.
[284:09.60]Restore magicka.
[284:10.72]Fortify magic.
[284:11.86]Restore endurance.
[284:12.84]Shield.
[284:14.17]Burden, though.
[284:14.81]I wonder what that is.
[284:16.31]What does that mean?
[284:16.89]Restore endurance.
[284:28.53]This is just shield.
[284:35.68]Damage and fatigue.
[284:36.46]Okay, I get it.
[284:42.20]Go down, don't scroll.
[284:44.16]Restore magicka!
[284:47.90]Drink it up.
[284:53.63]Alright.
[284:55.09]Where can I go now?
[284:56.15]Can I go?
[284:58.53]I don't think I can even go that way.
[285:07.32]Wasn't there, um...
[285:18.60]Don't you dare.
[285:20.12]What are you doing?
[285:23.88]Told you.
[285:24.94]Oh my god, you're kicking my ass.
[285:32.34]Poison.
[285:35.38]Bring another potion.
[285:46.86]Ooh, and a repair hammer.
[285:48.42]My favorite.
[285:49.36]My favorite item.
[285:54.70]What did that not hit you?
[286:07.53]What happened to Nightbot?
[286:08.27]Why are people talking about Nightbot?
[286:14.17]What did Nightbot do?
[286:17.51]What happened to Nightbot?
[286:18.87]What happened?
[286:23.85]What difficulty is this?
[286:24.75]It's just like right in the middle somewhere.
[286:28.25]I guess now it is.
[286:33.63]I was told that putting this any higher than this is just a dumb idea.
[286:47.17]Okay, that's good.
[286:51.01]Root door to the naughty bramble.
[286:56.38]For you, maybe.
[286:57.40]What?
[287:00.42]I was specifically told that any more than like a half an inch this way, like this is just stupid because all it does is just make enemies just complete meat sponges.
[287:16.91]The general consensus from what I understand is to never go past here.
[287:20.79]It doesn't do anything for you.
[287:23.21]It just makes enemies just take longer to die.
[287:25.54]It's just, it's boring.
[287:27.16]Do not go past that.
[287:31.16]See?
[287:31.68]Somebody just said it.
[287:34.30]Why is the difficulty a slider?
[287:35.90]Because 2006 was a very, people were like still, they had the big hair, you know, back in 2006.
[287:45.55]The Hairspray came out.
[287:50.79]Michael Jackson was really big back here.
[287:52.75]The Goonies was a pretty popular movie.
[287:59.75]This is back a pretty long time ago.
[288:22.76]That's a big guy in there.
[288:23.86]Alright.
[288:24.34]Where's the... I think that's the... Is the pool down there?
[288:27.70]I think that's the pool.
[288:28.60]I made it to the... What the fuck was that?
[288:40.03]Die.
[288:56.19]Actually, I think I have potions now, right?
[289:00.18]Restore, Magicka, and I also have a different one too, don't I?
[289:05.68]Maybe not.
[289:10.36]No, I don't.
[289:11.24]Well, shit.
[289:11.90]There's the pool down there, so I'll be good.
[289:17.37]Just gotta make my way down.
[289:18.31]2006 is next year.
[289:26.66]No, that's 2007, dude.
[289:27.42]What are you talking about?
[289:34.30]Into the pool.
[289:35.00]I've arrived at the pool!
[289:36.16]I should get as close as possible to the statue in its center to gather a sample of the Aquanostrum.
[289:54.86]It's a weird thing.
[289:56.48]I can't fight on the stairs there.
[290:08.21]Oh, fuck.
[290:11.34]Oh, this is not good.
[290:12.44]This is very bad.
[290:31.61]Those of you that were asking about the difficulty, you're seeing why.
[290:52.00]I've recovered a sample.
[290:52.90]I did it.
[290:53.42]I should return to new Shiath and present it to her for my well-deserved reward.
[291:00.45]That's where I kill these guys.
[291:01.39]I need the experience point.
[291:04.74]No... I don't care.
[291:13.60]I don't care.
[291:14.04]Wait, the statue has, like, shit on it.
[291:17.22]There's, like, eggs in there.
[291:18.07]Oh, that's funny.
[291:21.53]Money, money, money, money.
[291:26.01]So I'm not going to do this anymore.
[291:28.01]We're going to bring... Do you see how far that was?
[291:30.77]That was from here to here.
[291:34.79]And the game became exceptionally more hard to play.
[291:47.25]Uh, but Baked Flakes.
[291:49.39]Thank you Baked Flakes for the $50.
[291:50.83]50 bucks from Baked Flakes.
[291:53.53]Baked Lays, I almost said.
[291:55.31]I'm hungry.
[291:56.08]Uh, this playthrough has been amazing so far.
[291:59.70]Thank you, first of all.
[292:01.28]I was originally skeptical because of how bad your character was.
[292:03.80]Like, seriously, it's impressive how bad you made the stats on this guy.
[292:07.34]But after seeing this guy in action, I can say with certainty that he's still, uh, bad.
[292:12.20]But somehow playable.
[292:13.64]Anyway, thanks for the laughs.
[292:14.82]Eat these bits on stream.
[292:19.59]If you're hungry, eat the sandwich.
[292:21.77]Thank you, uh, Baked Flakes.
[292:24.15]Appreciate it, man.
[292:24.73]Thank you for the $50.
[292:27.31]And this game's fun.
[292:28.55]This is a great game.
[292:29.67]I'm having a blast right now.
[292:33.49]But only when the difficulty is turned down to the middle.
[292:39.18]It's such, like, a drastic change.
[292:46.94]As I fucking die.
[292:47.96]I say that, and then I'm gonna die.
[292:49.80]On stream here.
[292:51.24]Nope, I'm good.
[292:53.76]Almost.
[292:58.32]Restore.
[292:58.92]Just do it all.
[292:59.86]Restore fatigue.
[293:00.60]Restore magicka.
[293:01.62]Restore... Where is it?
[293:05.80]Potion of healing.
[293:09.48]Potion of cure poison.
[293:10.82]No.
[293:13.10]Leak potion of healing.
[293:15.27]Let's go.
[293:18.46]Check the chest.
[293:19.14]Wait, wait, wait.
[293:20.97]Not that those guys are all gone.
[293:33.27]Eat the fans.
[293:36.34]Wait, you mean like circle fans or you mean like people?
[293:39.48]Alright, well, there's nothing here.
[293:50.13]Was there a chest back here?
[293:51.33]I don't remember seeing a chest.
[293:58.43]Was there a chest?
[294:08.68]Y'all are fucking weird.
[294:10.18]Move means move.
[294:17.54]Actually, I probably can just fast travel out of here.
[294:24.63]Can't fast travel from this location.
[294:26.85]Bullshit.
[294:33.33]No, this is like a new zone.
[294:34.57]I gotta... I'm going deeper.
[294:35.61]I gotta go to the right.
[294:47.79]They're going up and around.
[294:49.13]I don't want to do that.
[294:50.47]I missed a tinted rock.
[294:56.03]It's a pretty good Binding of Isaac reference.
[294:59.13]It's a really good game.
[295:00.00]I recommend it.
[295:02.58]If you've never played it before, it's pretty good.
[295:04.08]It's pretty fun.
[295:04.80]It's challenging.
[295:14.39]He won't eat the sandwich that he left in his car for six days.
[295:17.23]I don't know where you're getting the days from.
[295:31.12]They're making another expansion for Rebirth.
[295:38.62]Really?
[295:39.00]How do you come up with that much more material for that game?
[295:43.36]Fucking brambles.
[295:44.44]Well, I told you there was a switch!
[295:53.83]Going the wrong way.
[296:20.50]It's too dark in here.
[296:30.03]Alright.
[296:30.67]Now we can fast travel.
[296:37.96]You cannot fast travel with an enemy nearby.
[296:41.05]Am I being chased?
[296:48.58]Where's... Right, alright.
[296:50.52]Just... Fuck off.
[296:54.20]Alright, leveled up.
[297:03.98]Whoa, you had a lot of stuff.
[297:05.84]Alright, cool.
[297:10.14]We get to level up now, too.
[297:11.22]That's good stuff.
[297:23.91]Get our reward, sleep in the bed.
[297:27.77]And that is actually probably where I'm going to call the stream for tonight.
[297:34.93]I have to be well rested tomorrow.
[297:39.17]All my stuff is leaving tomorrow.
[297:44.07]I'm like not looking forward to it, but I'm looking forward to it at the same time.
[297:47.35]It's going to be such a pain in the ass.
[297:50.69]Where's this place?
[297:52.77]the inn right hello dog I thought okay I thought I just killed the dog I heard that I saw like the head fly across I hope you have here's the cure let me see
[298:12.64]Yes, this is it.
[298:14.98]Do I feel bad leaving Boston for so long?
[298:16.60]I mean, I don't think I feel bad, but I'll miss it for sure.
[298:18.18]What did I get?
[298:19.83]Circlet of Verdure.
[298:20.51]What's that?
[298:39.78]Resist disease, resist poison, fortify health, and fortify endurance.
[298:45.54]How many rings can you wear?
[298:46.40]This is pretty good.
[298:47.10]Okay, nice.
[298:52.31]I can wear it.
[298:59.05]Gold ring?
[298:59.83]Don't need it.
[299:00.27]Alright, cool.
[299:02.25]That's pretty good.
[299:05.25]Is this the last stream?
[299:06.44]No, this is not the last stream in Massachusetts.
[299:09.06]No.
[299:11.94]There is a stream.
[299:13.29]Well, there'll be plenty of streams until I leave, but all my stuff leaves tomorrow.
[299:20.03]Oh shit, I don't have the room anymore.
[299:24.63]It's gotta be a very weird... How do I buy a room?
[299:45.66]Why am I stopping streaming?
[299:48.88]At, I think at around 8 a.m.
[299:50.89]tomorrow morning, there is a truck coming to the house.
[299:56.25]And I have to load up that truck over the next 24 straight hours.
[300:04.98]All my stuff.
[300:09.16]It's all going in there.
[300:12.20]It's gonna be a long fucking day tomorrow and the next day because then I have to try to figure out a way how the hell am I gonna live for the next two weeks.
[300:26.48]Here we go, three attributes.
[300:29.23]Endurance.
[300:33.21]Hmm.
[300:41.62]Best thing in the world is drinking beer and eating pizza after loading the truck with all your stuff.
[300:46.78]You know, that's true.
[300:48.44]Level four, I did it.
[300:53.29]I mean, it has to be, it's always strength, right?
[300:57.13]Maybe I should do agility.
[300:59.93]Yeah, I'm gonna do strength and agility.
[301:15.50]Just because I want the fatigue.
[301:16.84]I'm going to be using a big two-hander probably eventually.
[301:26.15]Why am I in the aisles at level four?
[301:27.51]I wanted to see it.
[301:31.15]It all scales with you anyway, so it's alright.
[301:40.02]Very cool.
[301:40.94]Let's save this.
[301:47.90]Ideally, you'll get them all to max.
[301:49.29]Yeah, that's true.
[301:52.45]Anyways.
[301:55.39]After today, the next stream from this computer will be in Las Vegas.
[302:05.27]It's going to be fun to figure out what the hell I'm gonna do for the remaining about, you know, 11 or 12 days of streams.
[302:17.30]That I have here, pretty much.
[302:18.42]Like, about... You'll see me again on... You'll see me again on Friday.
[302:29.06]I will be doing something on Friday.
[302:33.01]We'll figure it out.
[302:36.23]And then it gets real weird.
[302:37.79]Because we're going to have to hook up consoles...
[302:44.97]I'm gonna miss my computer.
[302:46.09]I'm not gonna see it for like two and a half weeks.
[302:50.41]Why is it gonna take two weeks to move?
[302:51.75]It's not gonna take two weeks to move.
[302:53.09]The moving company takes two weeks to go from Boston to Las Vegas.
[302:57.75]It has to go across the whole country.
[303:00.64]So it's pretty typical moving that far.
[303:03.92]It takes about anywhere from like 12 to 16 days to move everything.
[303:14.46]ship everything in air transit uh well that would probably be about ten thousand dollars uh so I'm not going to do that that actually might even be more that might be like 20 grand I was auto going to get there auto is going to fly with me on the plane just the computer in air transit
[303:44.56]No, I did the math.
[303:45.42]I calculated everything out.
[303:48.18]I'm going to get one of these shipping companies.
[303:52.99]That costs a lot of money to do that in the first place.
[303:55.77]So why would I spend a bunch of money to have all my shit shipped out and then spend even more money just to have my computer go out?
[304:03.81]I'll live, you know, and I'll survive.
[304:06.46]I have another computer I can use until then, and we have other stuff we can stream.
[304:18.12]Flying pets is dangerous.
[304:19.50]I've heard Well, he's been cleared.
[304:22.20]I brought him to the vet.
[304:23.18]They check him out.
[304:24.56]They sign a form that says he's okay to fly and He got that form.
[304:29.64]He's apparently healthy enough to fly so There was a lot of options
[304:38.70]There was drive, but that's almost a 50-hour drive, which would take a full week or two driving to get there, which that just... And then how does my stuff get out there?
[304:50.17]Do I drive and then ship everything?
[304:52.45]That's... Why not just take everything at that point?
[304:55.54]Rent a truck and do it myself.
[305:00.64]And then I thought, what if I fly out there and then just don't bring anything and...
[305:05.06]There's been a lot... Trust me when I say we're talking about whole nights of my life deleted over trying to figure out how the hell I'm going to do this.
[305:13.51]And I figured this is the solution that I'm going to go with.
[305:21.29]Just 50 hours.
[305:22.29]I could do that in a day.
[305:26.12]Yeah, you give or take.
[305:27.68]If you can stream... If you can stream for six hours a day...
[305:33.47]After six hours in a car, I have to get out of that car.
[305:36.83]I will lose my mind.
[305:41.20]So a six to eight hour drive, then you got to stop.
[305:45.34]You got to go to sleep.
[305:46.14]8, 12, 16, you know, 6, 12, you're talking about like, it's too much.
[306:00.89]It would take at least... If I just drove for fucking eight straight hours a day or ten straight hours a day, just on the road alone, it would still take me about five full days to get there.
[306:17.58]So there's no way it's gonna happen.
[306:22.28]So this is the solution.
[306:24.24]And we gotta make it work.
[306:25.74]We'll figure it out.
[306:29.40]take a train from Boston to Las Vegas, that would probably be... I don't think that's even possible.
[306:40.79]You cannot fast travel while enemies are around.
[306:44.51]Let's drop this out.
[306:48.40]And put this up.
[306:50.66]I'm going to show the credits.
[306:54.60]Let me get this walker.
[306:57.74]I wonder how long that would actually take.
[306:59.06]That'd probably take you like five... It'd probably take you a year to do that.
[307:02.10]Maybe more.
[307:02.52]Let's get this up.
[307:13.77]But thank you everybody for subscribing.
[307:15.43]Here come all these wonderful people.
[307:20.90]Thank you so much to all the new subs and all the old subs, of course.
[307:25.78]If you missed last night's stream...
[307:28.42]I'm changing, very soon here, the way that subs are handled at the end of a stream.
[307:37.04]I'm no longer going to read out every subscription that comes through.
[307:42.18]We're still gonna do this, but if you missed last night's stream, then I explained it before, but I'll give you this quick little rundown.
[307:52.59]We're gonna do, like, subscriber joke perks.
[307:57.11]At the end of a stream, I'm essentially gonna pull a slot machine and random people that subbed during that stream are gonna get to potentially have an interesting few seconds of fun.
[308:09.65]We had a whole reel talk about it last stream.
[308:12.75]If you wanna find out what's going on there, you absolutely can.
[308:20.22]But thank you again, everybody,
[308:22.87]Ooh, whole seconds.
[308:24.83]Ooh, yeah, that's right.
[308:26.09]But remember, these are the things that we're talking about.
[308:29.33]Like, one of the things we talked about last night was, you know, we pull the lever and, like, three people get chat by themselves for, like, a full minute or something.
[308:40.37]We get a funny joke.
[308:41.76]Well, not to repeat everything we said last night, but...
[308:48.32]As the channel grows, and as more people are subscribing, and more people are giving bits, and continuously showing this stream in such extreme amounts of generosity, this becomes harder to do.
[309:03.75]The bits become harder, the subs become harder to do.
[309:06.55]And I don't... I know it's funny when I'm just like, A MYSTERIOUS AWARD!
[309:11.29]But at some point, this might be impossible.
[309:14.67]Generation!
[309:16.91]And...
[309:19.07]We've talked about how long the bits can go and how many people subscribe and... I kind of want to move the stream in the direction of... Just a general thank you, everybody, for even considering subscribing.
[309:41.64]But we've talked about before, I don't like the idea ever of...
[309:47.29]stopping my stream in the middle to say names and we've stopped doing that like a year ago we'll see I have a few solutions in mind that might make it the end here after these credits a little bit more interesting for everybody how many thoughts on urinals of course oh I've got plenty of thoughts on urinals
[310:17.35]I don't care if you don't read them, but that sounds like a bad idea.
[310:20.29]Well, look, it wouldn't be... We wouldn't probably even do it that often.
[310:27.30]Maybe once a month or something like that, we would just try to do something interesting.
[310:30.66]Because I do want to... I don't just want to write off everybody as a number and just be like, yeah, thanks, everybody.
[310:37.14]Bye.
[310:40.14]There are a few ideas that are floating around.
[310:52.36]I'm a urinal-centric thinker.
[310:55.27]It's genuinely hard.
[310:56.17]It is a genuinely difficult thing.
[311:00.01]A lot of my brain goes into thinking about this shit because it's kind of the solution that is currently viable or was viable will not be.
[311:12.63]What do you do?
[311:13.29]It's hard to determine.
[311:16.01]We just raised the bits.
[311:17.23]I just said it has to be 100 bits to be read on stream.
[311:25.10]But when does that become not feasible anymore?
[311:28.40]Sometimes we spend an hour or two at the end of these streams.
[311:32.40]At what point is it maybe the channel grows even more and then it's not physically possible for me to read them.
[311:44.16]And I would never want to get rid of this part.
[311:47.73]But you just have to adapt to certain things.
[311:50.57]I have to change things and try to make the streams more streamlined and better for everybody and... I'd watch an entire stream of this stream over.
[312:06.07]No, I... Not... Like, I don't want to parrot... I don't want to parrot everything I said last night.
[312:13.05]But...
[312:13.99]There were there's a lot of thought of going into how this is gonna play out Hire someone to play the game for you and then do the stream part over And I will never do TTS I know that's that's a solution that everybody uses and it's a solution and it works but I I hate that solution because I feel like it ruins a stream and
[312:37.92]It's just somebody, it's just something is constantly talking over you and talking over the stream.
[312:44.06]It's just something speaking over you.
[312:48.70]I hate that idea.
[312:50.89]But a lot of people use it because it solves this problem completely.
[312:56.87]So they can focus on the stream and then TTS just reads potentially hundreds of donations of stream.
[313:05.78]But that's a solution.
[313:09.10]What else do you do?
[313:19.51]People just try to get TTS to say crazy things too.
[313:23.37]Yeah, I would much rather have something organic.
[313:29.99]But at least still make sense.
[313:38.41]TTS would get in the way of clips.
[313:42.49]Yeah, and it would also get in the way of other streams that I want to do.
[313:49.63]And even some of the ones I've already done.
[313:51.25]Can you imagine if TTS was just talking over the dinner of my family?
[313:56.01]That would be not even worth streaming, if that was the case.
[314:00.18]It would be stupid.
[314:04.59]It just wouldn't make any sense at all.
[314:06.16]It would take away from the entire reason why I did that.
[314:20.15]It's just a difficult thing because I don't want people to... I want to acknowledge people for paying me tons of fucking money because it's... I... There's no amount of times I can say thank you more than I do.
[314:31.53]It's hard.
[314:33.06]I can't even believe it some of the amounts of money that I get on this stream but like the the stream still needs to be unaffected it is a balancing act for sure anyways for the time being like I said last night nothing is changing
[314:57.81]Might see something in the near future.
[315:00.29]And I might not.
[315:00.86]I might experiment with something.
[315:02.24]We might do it for a little while.
[315:03.40]Or like a week or two.
[315:04.12]And I'll be like, this is not working.
[315:08.56]But Ivory, thank you for the $1.
[315:09.58]Mile ago.
[315:12.94]Whoops.
[315:13.58]Last bits got cut off.
[315:15.87]In regards to difficulty in Oblivion, many modders are familiar with the leveling problem.
[315:20.29]Basically, the enemies of the world level when you level.
[315:23.58]But based on what skills you leveled up with, especially with those you use a lot, you're at a greater disadvantage if you level up poorly.
[315:30.34]In order to get strong, you need to grind out skills outside of your class and spend the attributes in endurance and strength.
[315:36.84]Hope that helps.
[315:40.77]That's true.
[315:42.68]That makes a lot of sense.
[315:43.90]So level up alchemy a bunch and level up other things.
[315:46.82]Is that why people tell me to jump around?
[315:49.30]To jump everywhere?
[315:54.57]To level up that skill so I can level up?
[315:57.29]Okay, that makes a lot of sense then.
[316:00.97]Raise the bit reading threshold and have all the bit messages roll down the screen at the end like subs.
[316:07.14]It's a possibility.
[316:09.36]It is.
[316:12.72]Haven't come up with the idea yet, but we'll see we don't really it's not there now But it could very well be in the future But thank you ivy thank you whole of one zombie for the two dollars hey Jerma my VCR is busted so if you could tape Water the ultimate force at 3 a.m.
[316:33.58]And mail it to me.
[316:34.36]That'd be great
[316:36.05]Uh, the address is England, with a lowercase e. Okay, thanks, bye.
[316:41.45]Now, let me mail a VHS to England.
[316:47.45]Thank you, Holo1Zombie.
[316:49.73]Thank you, StixRenegade, for the $1.
[316:52.17]S is for sus, the time that we wait for.
[316:54.90]U is for you and me.
[316:56.30]S is for streamer that is very fucking late.
[317:00.14]Being early ain't a guarantee.
[317:09.18]I don't... Late, early... It still happens.
[317:19.82]We're still here.
[317:23.19]Thank you.
[317:23.53]Bake me home for the $2.
[317:24.89]Can't stick around.
[317:25.61]VOD better be amazing or I'm going to sue you.
[317:29.17]I hope it is.
[317:30.37]I hope you like it.
[317:31.13]I really don't want to deal with the lawyer situation right now.
[317:34.42]Tresnik, thanks for the two bucks.
[317:35.96]Long time viewer.
[317:36.60]First time catching a stream.
[317:37.60]Love your stuff.
[317:38.94]Thank you.
[317:40.24]Welcome.
[317:42.85]Glad you caught a stream.
[317:43.87]Hopefully you liked it.
[317:44.81]Hopefully you had a good time.
[317:47.95]I'm Virtue0.
[317:48.31]Thank you for the $10.
[317:49.39]I'm Virtue.
[317:52.08]Thank you so much, Virtue.
[317:52.62]A lot of you guys are...
[318:19.40]Uh, getting into the college age here and starting college.
[318:21.58]I've noticed a lot of those messages.
[318:26.04]It's interesting to know and to see, essentially, the audience and the community, like, grow up together.
[318:35.53]You know what I mean?
[318:39.79]That's a long time.
[318:40.63]That's a big part of your life.
[318:43.02]You know what I mean?
[318:45.18]From middle school to college...
[318:48.97]That's a major chunk of your entire early adult life.
[318:58.98]I just hope you still are having a good time.
[319:01.54]Hope you still find all this worth watching.
[319:07.34]If you do, I'm glad you do.
[319:08.24]Thank you.
[319:14.01]And good luck in college.
[319:16.38]Freshman year, like Spencer just said, it is very difficult.
[319:19.58]It gets a lot easier, though, after the first year or two.
[319:24.26]You'll start making friends, you'll start to be in more clubs, and you'll get more involved with stuff.
[319:29.73]It just takes a little while.
[319:33.51]Thank you, though.
[319:34.49]Thank you, Backbiter, for the $5.
[319:35.73]This is my first time watching a stream in a few months, and I've already busted a gut laughing.
[319:40.69]Never change.
[319:42.13]Never change.
[319:45.18]Thank you, Backbiter.
[319:45.94]I don't... I never plan on it.
[319:48.70]I mean, my body will change.
[319:49.86]I'm getting older.
[319:50.40]You know, I'm gonna start sagging in certain places.
[319:56.22]Like, my neck and my cheeks and my neck and my chin and stuff.
[320:00.49]My neck and my chin.
[320:09.63]Jowls.
[320:13.44]But thank you, Backbiter.
[320:14.85]Thank you, Timmy, Tim-Tam for the $1.
[320:16.43]Don't start the stream, please.
[320:17.55]I need to get another drink.
[320:20.43]I'm sorry, but we started without you.
[320:22.43]Hopefully you made it.
[320:24.91]Pocket Pauling, thank you for the $7, Pocket Pauling.
[320:28.01]Here at Jerma, I have the $7 I made today.
[320:30.80]Enjoy.
[320:31.16]$7 you made today.
[320:38.34]Thank you for the $7 that you made today.
[320:40.28]Can I ask, did you watch two episodes of...
[320:44.79]Jake Paul.
[320:47.36]What was it called?
[320:51.26]What's the thing that gave the bits?
[320:57.04]Jack Ryan.
[320:57.80]That's what it was.
[320:59.94]No, not Jake.
[321:03.73]Jack Ryan.
[321:07.73]Thank you, though, Pocket Pauling.
[321:09.51]Appreciate the $7, dude.
[321:11.87]Thank you, bro.
[321:12.41]Luck for the $1.
[321:13.21]Bro, I came back to you screaming into the microphone.
[321:15.50]You hurt my ears.
[321:16.46]I don't think... I don't know if I did.
[321:18.76]I listened to that clip.
[321:19.78]But if I did, I'm sorry about that.
[321:24.98]Killcode, thank you again for the $50.
[321:26.18]We'll, of course, touch upon it again.
[321:29.07]Thanks so much, dude, if you're still here.
[321:33.53]Appreciate it, dude.
[321:34.43]Thank you so much.
[321:37.55]Saturn in... Saturn in Ocean.
[321:44.32]Saturn in Ocean.
[321:46.02]Thanks for the $1.
[321:46.84]Hey, Jerma, I came out as trans to a bunch of my friends today, and they were all supportive.
[321:52.21]I'm the happiest I've been in a long time.
[321:54.73]Transgender pride.
[321:58.60]That's awesome.
[322:02.52]Glad to hear that.
[322:11.77]I've said this before, many times, be the best person that you know how to be.
[322:21.50]You know you best.
[322:23.38]Right?
[322:37.19]What if I only know how to be a little shit?
[322:40.61]Um...
[322:44.30]then be the best little shit you could possibly be.
[322:47.46]I don't know.
[322:52.55]And you own that and you fucking be the best.
[323:04.49]Yeah, but that's good to hear.
[323:08.32]Thank you, Saturn, so much for your one dollar.
[323:12.73]Hey, Permavirgin, thanks for the $1.
[323:15.99]Hey, Sinners, be sure to use promo code FATFUCK on RazorZone.com for sweet gamer gear.
[323:22.29]I read that, I didn't say that.
[323:27.17]Thank you, Ganja... Ganja Jensen.
[323:31.39]Ganja Jensen for the $5.
[323:33.41]I really, really enjoy watching you play Oblivion.
[323:37.53]Also, Swifty... Com...
[323:45.95]What's that?
[323:55.17]What'd I do?
[324:01.93]What happened?
[324:12.29]I don't get it.
[324:20.69]I said it.
[324:21.17]I don't know.
[324:21.55]What do you mean I said it?
[324:26.53]I said that so slowly because my brain is so just riddled with issues that I don't think I said anything.
[324:35.13]Thank you, though.
[324:36.29]Thank you, Ganja, for the $2.
[324:39.07]Actually, $6 here total.
[324:46.29]Thank you so much.
[324:48.14]you sticks renegade for the one dollar why are you gonna cause a scuffle with us furries leave the cat person alone um it doesn't matter I just want I didn't know why they were there they were just there for no reason that person wasn't in any armor the president not that person was just a person just there I know exactly what you're describing
[325:21.55]But thank you.
[325:22.27]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[325:23.77]You better believe once you've completed this game, I will make a Jerma resets his FOV compilation.
[325:34.37]Why would you want to make that?
[325:36.25]Why?
[325:38.82]That's going to happen so many times.
[325:40.46]No, it's not.
[325:40.88]It's going to be done tomorrow.
[325:42.38]After the stream.
[325:43.32]When we come back on Friday and stream, it'll be changed.
[325:47.34]Hey, Kvas.
[325:48.04]Thanks, Kvas, for the $1.35.
[325:51.23]I almost forgot I had these to cheer.
[325:52.79]How's it going, sinners?
[325:54.75]I hope you're doing well, Jerma.
[325:55.81]Securing a job has been slow, but it's coming along.
[325:58.59]Soon you'll get millions of bits.
[326:01.39]Love you.
[326:05.23]Thank you so much, class, but you take care of you first.
[326:11.88]You do you first.
[326:13.68]You take care of you first.
[326:17.78]Then you figure out what you want to do after that.
[326:25.68]But thank you so much.
[326:27.10]Really appreciate it.
[326:29.56]I wish you the best.
[326:30.16]Be the best sinner that you can be.
[326:39.13]Morning Maple, thank you for the $10, Morning Maple.
[326:42.95]Hey, Jerma.
[326:44.19]I'm sending you $10 because it was my birthday on the 10th.
[326:47.68]If you could say happy birthday, Kirsten, that'd be awesome.
[326:50.38]It's pronounced like Kirsten in case you get stuck.
[326:56.28]This is great.
[326:56.96]I love this part because like, so that's in brackets that, but that's in parentheses.
[327:02.08]So.
[327:05.01]just help in case you get stuck.
[327:07.91]I knew it was going to happen.
[327:10.10]That's so funny.
[327:11.28]Thank you.
[327:12.02]Thank you, Kirsten.
[327:13.46]I'm staying in New Jersey with my dad right now, so we went to the Museum of Natural History in New York City.
[327:19.83]It's pretty sweet.
[327:20.63]Highly recommend it to everyone.
[327:23.73]Well, happy birthday, Kirsten.
[327:29.37]Hope you had a good one.
[327:32.21]And I have never... I don't think I've been to the Museum of Natural History before.
[327:39.11]If I'm ever around, I will definitely give it a look.
[327:43.87]I went to pretty much all the museums in Washington, D.C.
[327:47.23]And those are really cool, too.
[327:48.11]If you get a chance, if you're ever in the D.C.
[327:52.08]area, they're all pretty interesting.
[327:55.28]And pretty interesting places.
[327:58.88]But thank you so much, Morning Maple.
[328:00.90]And happy birthday.
[328:08.10]That's a really nice place.
[328:09.34]We ran out of time when we were there.
[328:10.98]Yeah, you can get lost in those museums in DC.
[328:16.50]Velociforce, thanks for the three bucks.
[328:18.98]Gotta send some bits for this awesome game.
[328:20.83]Keep on doing what you're doing, man.
[328:21.87]Your streams are awesome.
[328:24.61]Thank you.
[328:25.75]Velociforce, thank you so much.
[328:28.67]Appreciate the three dollars and this really just nice, kind message.
[328:32.55]Thank you.
[328:34.67]Div USP, thank you for $4.
[328:37.27]No message from Div.
[328:40.77]But thank you so much, Div.
[328:44.38]I see your name pop up all the time.
[328:48.48]Thank you.
[328:50.98]The Evil King Howard, thanks for the five bucks, Evil King Howard.
[328:55.32]Hey, Jerma, thanks for helping me through some tough times.
[328:57.38]You kind of are pretty fucking awesome.
[329:01.79]Thank you.
[329:05.20]Thank you so much, King... Evil King Howard.
[329:09.46]Hopefully you feel better.
[329:10.46]Hopefully you're doing alright.
[329:13.65]And... Thank you for... Saying that about me.
[329:22.54]I'm just happy that you're enjoying the streams.
[329:24.18]Thank you, man.
[329:27.64]Moby, thank you, Moby, for the $1.
[329:29.10]Yo, Jeremy, long time follower of you on YouTube.
[329:32.04]I really love your content and sense of comedy.
[329:34.54]Recently started catching your streams.
[329:36.04]What's the story behind the planet emotes?
[329:40.35]Again, I mean, I'll just explain it again.
[329:42.39]It's... I just got an epiphany in the shower that I wanted to take out a telescope and capture some images.
[329:51.05]And those are the images.
[329:52.85]Those are the real images from not only the NASA website,
[329:58.10]but from my own personal collection of taking pictures of the moon and Jupiter.
[330:02.48]That's what they look like.
[330:04.24]I didn't doctor those images at all.
[330:11.24]Somebody was like, hey dude, you could pass as the moon.
[330:16.05]You could pass as the sun.
[330:17.57]You could be that for Halloween.
[330:19.99]I'm like, I could.
[330:20.67]Could I?
[330:20.97]Let me look at it again.
[330:23.13]I zoomed in and looked at it.
[330:28.58]So those are all just real pictures.
[330:32.43]But thank you, though.
[330:33.69]Thank you, Moby.
[330:37.11]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[330:38.47]Give sleep your bones.
[330:43.42]Saturn.
[330:44.64]Saturn and Ocean again for $1.
[330:46.74]Thanks a lot, man.
[330:50.10]Oh, actually, that was the wrong one.
[330:51.52]I read the wrong donation here.
[330:54.25]That was Darkstar for $1.
[330:57.78]Now, Saturn, thank you for the $1.
[330:59.08]Oh, Darkstar, thanks for the $1 too.
[331:01.86]I'm like skipping people here.
[331:06.46]But thank you, Saturn.
[331:08.82]Again, for the $1.
[331:10.21]I'm glad you seem to be enjoying Oblivion.
[331:11.61]It's my favorite Elder Scrolls game.
[331:14.21]Would you ever consider playing Morrowind?
[331:15.63]It's a little hard to get into at first, but it's great once you get the hang of things.
[331:23.33]Ah, that's like we talked about it before.
[331:24.73]Morrowind and Oblivion and...
[331:27.88]Dark Souls 2, it's just... I feel like I'm going to have one of those syndromes where because I played Oblivion first for real, it's going to be the one that I care about the most.
[331:41.25]Right?
[331:42.25]So no matter what other ones I play after this, well, Oblivion did this and it was better.
[331:46.53]That's just kind of what happens when you do these games.
[331:49.33]It just is.
[331:59.24]Can you make clips in the VOD?
[332:00.57]I think you can.
[332:04.37]But we'll see.
[332:04.93]Morrowind is just another one of those games that's open and fun, right?
[332:12.07]Am I doing submissions for the green screen stream?
[332:14.33]Not yet.
[332:16.67]That's going to happen a few days, pretty much.
[332:20.77]Probably like the week before I leave.
[332:22.69]So just about two weeks from now, give or take, that's when we're going to do that stream.
[332:29.54]And I will have plenty of time to tell everybody what's going to happen and the rules, and we'll talk about it in a few days, actually.
[332:40.11]But thank you, Saturn.
[332:40.77]Thank you for the $1.
[332:42.51]GarfieldTheMondayKiller, thanks for the $1.
[332:44.21]And that, my friends, is how Garfield the Tale of Two Kitties got 11% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[332:50.40]Hey, didn't see you there.
[332:53.26]Geronimo.
[332:54.98]Did you hear about the new Garfield musical?
[332:57.06]It looks cheap.
[332:57.78]I don't think the cast looks like us at all.
[332:59.60]They don't even play any songs in the trailer.
[333:03.22]Odie looked at it and thought it was some sort of SNL sketch.
[333:05.36]So, Jerma, I humbly request that you roast me.
[333:10.33]Roast me.
[333:17.27]This is real?
[333:21.95]This is not a real thing.
[333:28.98]Is this real?
[333:32.61]Why can't I hear it?
[333:34.35]Oh god, now I can.
[333:35.39]Alright, I'm gonna watch- I'll watch the first like nine seconds of this.
[334:09.42]$26!
[334:09.46]$26!
[334:09.52]Is this even a Garfield musical?
[334:39.72]Is that a front row seat for $26?
[334:50.92]Roast them, roast them!
[334:54.08]I mean, okay, it's either $26 for her bleacher seat at the Celtics game, or $26 to go see people dress up, and not even dress up, I mean just put freckles on your face.
[335:11.50]That's tough, actually.
[335:12.66]I'm not sure that, you know, that actually, that's worth it to go to that, I think.
[335:21.01]Oh my God.
[335:23.43]I'd rather pay, moo, moo means moo.
[335:26.99]I'd rather pay a homeless man $26 to beat the shit out of me.
[335:34.02]I kind of like that.
[335:34.86]I would actually probably want to see that.
[335:45.40]I mean, that actually, hold on, let me look at this again.
[336:03.24]I would like, I would probably watch, I would probably see this.
[336:06.22]I would just be quiet the whole time.
[336:07.42]You know what I mean?
[336:12.10]I would just sit in the back of the theater with my hand on my chin, just watch.
[336:19.33]How long would I stay there for?
[336:21.73]The whole thing?
[336:23.90]I wouldn't tell anybody where I was going.
[336:26.55]Jeremy, what are you doing tonight?
[336:28.29]I think about going to have like a night in, you know, just me and just some TV, maybe just like chill.
[336:33.66]Hey, do you want to come out with this?
[336:35.12]No, it's just a me night, you know, and go to the Garfield musical and just sit there and watch it and then leave.
[336:42.44]And I would never talk about it ever again.
[336:52.03]I just would have to see it.
[337:03.03]Watch it and then go to bed.
[337:13.34]Garfield the musical.
[337:14.38]Well, thank you, Garfield.
[337:17.95]It looks... I'll tell you right now.
[337:19.57]I'll tell you one thing.
[337:20.33]It does look zany.
[337:22.21]It looks zany.
[337:25.89]I'd have to see it.
[337:27.00]Just... But like I told you, I would never talk about it.
[337:29.86]I would just go and I would just straight face the whole... Even though something was really funny.
[337:34.72]There could be a really funny joke in there and I would just stone face it.
[337:38.87]Just so I could process what was going on.
[337:44.31]But thank you.
[337:46.39]No, I know.
[337:46.71]It's all just fun and games.
[337:47.53]We're not... It's alright.
[337:48.01]It's good.
[337:48.25]We're all good.
[337:48.81]Don't worry.
[338:20.85]But thank you for the dollar, Dizzy.
[338:23.29]Positively human, thanks for the one dollar.
[338:25.01]Hey, Jerma, I'm planning on becoming a streamer and like to ask how you manage to edit your streams while live.
[338:31.99]For example, when you lost a Pinwheel and managed to quickly edit it out and replace it with a win.
[338:39.68]Um... Well...
[338:46.00]I mean, it was difficult to... Don't even make a joke about this, dude.
[338:51.77]Like, I'm making a joke about that being real, but I'm not going to further push that scenario and that narrative that happened.
[339:02.96]I beat him on the first try.
[339:05.26]I screamed a few times.
[339:06.42]I remember screaming twice because I thought I was going to get hit and die.
[339:10.62]But I didn't.
[339:12.68]And I know that.
[339:13.97]I have that here.
[339:15.64]I know it.
[339:17.22]Like you could say whatever you want, but I know it, right?
[339:21.06]I know it.
[339:21.72]And if it didn't happen, if it just didn't happen at all, then like that would be, I would have been in, it would have been a bad thing for me.
[339:28.60]You don't even, okay, that's, that hurt.
[339:31.76]You just, okay, you just hurt me.
[339:34.48]You did that.
[339:36.22]I didn't do that.
[339:36.88]Why did you do that?
[339:40.35]No, thank you Positively Human for the $1.
[339:43.51]Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[339:44.71]My blood boils every time you mention Neelix.
[339:47.21]Yeah, we've talked about it before.
[339:49.68]He's a character that everybody loves.
[339:52.70]Dytro, thanks for the $1.
[339:54.58]Earl for Jerma Rumble.
[339:57.34]No, he's fucking stupid.
[340:01.01]Thank you Tordungle for the $1.
[340:04.18]Homicidal streamer pushes Suicidal man off cliff strips him takes off runs off with his inheritance leaving his dirt laundry in his house You really have no moral compass.

[341:15.34]Streamer eats... He's saying something.
[341:20.58]I won't eat an hour or a couple hours.
[341:22.58]Okay.
[341:23.78]Here's more of this fake news.
[341:26.26]You know what I mean?
[341:26.78]Here's more of that fake news.
[341:29.43]Streamer won't eat a sandwich that's a couple hours old.
[341:34.74]A couple is not six.
[341:38.74]It's not six.
[341:40.42]And it's not in a humid fucking hot car.
[341:45.36]That makes it seem like that I bought a sandwich and forgot it on the counter for an hour and a half.
[341:51.36]And then I like throw it away.
[341:55.60]Your standards are too high.
[341:58.24]My health is of concern.
[342:02.66]Alright, would you rather I eat that sandwich or die to Pinwheel?
[342:05.56]Pick one, because you only get to have one false narrative here.
[342:09.20]So, which one is it?
[342:14.11]Like... Either, like, that sandwich was not worth eating, or I died to Pinwheel.
[342:19.59]Which one of these?
[342:28.41]The sandwich one.
[342:32.32]And he wrote something else here too, but I refuse to say it.
[342:35.81]Thank you, IamMonk.
[342:36.61]Thank you, Blastoise, for the $1.
[342:39.30]A man eats rancid meat on stream.

[342:46.10]Div USP, oh my...
[343:17.08]Food poisoning lasts 24 hours.
[343:19.28]Fake news.
[343:30.31]I didn't say that.
[343:30.97]Somebody else did.
[343:33.09]Is this the streamer that died to the shits?
[343:37.24]Thank you, Internet Jorge, for the $15.
[343:40.76]Thank you so much.
[343:41.72]Just scrape the mayo off.
[343:43.40]No, I don't do that.

[343:50.85]To be funny.
[343:53.39]No.
[343:53.94]I'm not Bill Crazy.

[344:08.93]Foot Powder Spray.
[344:09.65]Thanks for the $1.

[344:13.96]The sandwich, of course.
[344:15.92]Make sure it gets these, or my company and creators will be highly miffed.
[344:22.52]Thank you, Foot Powder Spray.
[344:24.26]Thank you, Cheesecake319 for the $1 Wawa BB Boo Boo Baba.
[344:29.29]I came out as transgender and took your advice, and it all worked out.
[344:38.53]What?
[344:40.46]That's good.
[344:42.42]That's good to hear.
[344:43.20]That's great to hear.
[344:52.70]Thank you so much, Cheesecake, and glad to hear that it all worked out.
[345:14.93]Thank you again for the one doll.
[345:18.41]You sound surprised that your advice worked.
[345:21.51]Like, whoa, alright.
[345:24.29]Okay.
[345:28.34]Well, I'll tell you one thing about advice, right?
[345:33.50]I've told you this a few times before, right?
[345:35.90]I can only just tell you, I can only say so much for any piece of advice.
[345:40.88]Doesn't matter what it is.
[345:42.02]It could be anything.
[345:44.75]I'm no expert.
[345:47.99]And there are definitely way more people that have much better ideas and are well more equipped to answer questions than me.
[345:55.71]I can only tell you how I feel, and... I just hope you guys realize that... I... As much as I have things to say, and I have advice and things that I... could tell you... Just take it with like a grain of salt, right?
[346:15.64]Because I'm speaking from almost total ignorance.
[346:20.03]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[346:21.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[346:22.79]I'm talking about like just in general.
[346:25.23]Like that makes it sound like everything I say is like stupid and wrong.
[346:29.79]I'm talking about like from a professional standpoint.
[346:33.53]If you have like a computer question, I have no professional like computer experience.
[346:39.47]If you're talking about should I do this or should I do that, I might not have any real experience with it.
[346:48.07]I've talked about like money stuff, like financial stuff.
[346:51.93]I'm not a financial advisor.
[346:54.39]I'm just a guy, right?
[347:02.24]Everything you say is stupid and wrong.
[347:04.76]Oh, really?
[347:06.58]Oh, really?
[347:07.16]Huh.
[347:15.28]Isn't that interesting?
[347:19.35]Ban that guy?
[347:20.05]No, don't ban him.
[347:21.11]Don't ban him.
[347:22.67]Do not ban that guy.
[347:23.73]I want him to know.
[347:25.45]I want them to know that they were going to get banned.
[347:29.92]And I want them to see that they would have had ten full seconds.
[347:35.64]I want you to know about that.
[347:37.86]Because now in your mind, you were banned forever.
[347:40.90]In your mind.
[347:42.23]I didn't have to do it.
[347:46.55]Somebody mod him instead.
[347:51.76]Don't do that.
[347:56.60]Baked Flakes, thanks for the $50 again.
[347:58.19]$50, $50, $50, $50.
[348:00.57]You were psychologically banned.
[348:12.03]But thank you, Baked Flakes.
[348:14.85]Really appreciate that.
[348:15.57]That's a lot of money.
[348:18.05]Thank you.
[348:21.79]Moo means moo thanks to the five dollars.
[348:23.41]Add garbage to your sandwich to counteract the germs.
[348:31.30]I'm so pissed off about that.
[348:33.46]Because it's midnight.
[348:35.84]And we're almost done here.
[348:37.94]And I gotta go figure.
[348:39.10]I had this perfect delicious turkey gobbler full big ass sandwich with like a bunch of meat in it.
[348:47.19]And now I gotta go figure out what the fuck I'm gonna eat tonight.
[348:52.57]Just thought about it again.
[348:54.16]Thank you, Moominsmoo.
[348:54.92]Thank you, Dragons... Thank you, Dragon Breath, for the $1.
[349:01.64]Hey, Jerma, I forgot I left these bits in my car all day.
[349:04.32]They look pretty gross, and I can't stand to keep them any longer.
[349:06.94]I heard you like this kind of stuff, so here you go.
[349:14.65]That was good.
[349:16.01]That was a good one.
[349:23.63]Thank you, dude.
[349:26.03]Thank you, Skinny Hat, for the $7.
[349:27.90]Hope the move goes smoothly for you.
[349:32.00]Jerma, here's some bits so you can buy a sandwich that isn't poison.
[349:37.72]That's pretty much what the sandwich costed, so... Thank you for the replacement sandwich, Skinny Hat.
[349:45.15]Really appreciate that.
[349:45.83]Thank you, dude.
[349:47.69]IamMonk, thanks for the $1.
[349:48.79]Do you have any thoughts on urinals?

[350:21.79]Thank you, G... Jesh... Jesh Homeboy.
[350:27.17]Thank you, Jess.
[350:28.65]I'm going to call you Jess.
[350:30.15]Thanks for the $1.
[350:30.97]Hey, Jerm, first time caller.
[350:31.99]Been watching you since you tried to buy Red Dead Redemption on Xbox a little over a year ago.
[350:37.27]You're one of the few people that make me laugh consistently.
[350:39.25]Thank you for all you've done.
[350:40.29]Seriously.
[350:40.83]Here's a quick little bit of fan art for your birthday this week.
[350:44.87]Oh, hey.
[350:48.09]Well, thank you.
[350:52.18]uh no that link doesn't work oh no the link don't work it's a dead link you still here uh jess homeboy you still here
[351:20.94]virus.
[351:21.48]No, it's a dead Imgur link.
[351:24.77]Yee!
[351:25.65]You're here.
[351:26.03]Alright.
[351:27.03]Do you have another link?
[351:29.15]The link doesn't work.
[351:30.51]It's a 404 on Imgur.
[351:34.83]There you are.
[351:41.56]And while we potentially wait for that, let's keep going.
[351:46.54]Dom Cheetle, thanks for the $1.
[351:48.36]I just started my first year of law school.
[351:52.13]And I promise you that I would not be here if I didn't have your streams and old YouTube vids to get me through it.
[352:00.03]Well, Dom Cheadle, congratulations on the first year of law school.
[352:07.60]I'll hit you up eventually if I ever need you.
[352:10.04]You know, right?
[352:10.54]You always gotta have a good lawyer.
[352:16.21]Good luck.
[352:18.45]That's great to hear.
[352:20.67]Did we get the link?
[352:22.62]link was deleted here we go what the oh my god this is just that this is like thinking man statue although that's the iq okay I get it that's awesome
[352:50.51]Thank you so much, Jess.
[352:52.67]That's great.
[353:04.22]Thank you again to Dom Cheeto.
[353:05.31]Thank you Kil-Chan for $1.
[353:09.37]He just says the word... Oh, he doesn't actually say it.
[353:12.43]He just spells out N-U-T.
[353:16.69]I think a sentence or two before that, he was talking about peanut butter and cashews and stuff.
[353:22.52]So, I mean, that would make sense.
[353:24.24]He was discussing in the chat.
[353:26.00]I saw it earlier.
[353:26.64]So, it makes sense that he would write that in a message, I think.
[353:30.95]Chubby Funster, thanks for the $1.
[353:32.15]Hey, Jerma, Pun Funster here with another side-splitting pun that you definitely love hearing.
[353:37.81]I do.
[353:38.73]I do.
[353:39.31]Where does a rancher record his inventory?
[353:42.38]In a catalog.
[353:45.37]Yellow belt.
[353:46.79]Yellow belt.
[353:47.68]Oh, my God.
[353:48.30]Yellow belt.
[353:48.82]Oh, my God.
[353:49.40]Yellow belt.
[353:49.90]Oh, my God.
[353:50.18]Yellow belt.
[353:53.00]Yellow belt.
[353:53.40]Oh, my God.
[353:53.88]Thanks, dude.
[353:57.88]Thank you.
[353:58.36]Kill Chan for the $1 again.
[354:02.67]How do you think your future grandkids are going to feel about your... What you do for your career and what you've done for a career here?
[354:14.53]as a streamer you think they'll look back on and have any questions oh that's a good thank you kill chin that's a great question um yeah I think that you know a little capsule for the grandkids to be able to see eventually it's interesting that they'll see it it depends on you know how are they do they I think jokes are funny do they think like I'm funny they think like video games are cool you know it's a lot to go into that
[354:40.79]So thank you for that.
[354:41.51]That's a very good question.
[354:42.41]Thank you, Kilchen.
[354:44.27]Thank you for the $1.
[354:46.41]Thank you, MooMeansMoo for the $1.
[354:48.05]Jerma sees a piece of natural history every time he looks in the mirror.
[354:56.10]What, a thousand years from now?
[355:00.28]Thank you, Moo.
[355:00.84]Thank you, Samuel Sish for the $1.
[355:02.32]Jerma wants to see a homeless man beat the shit out of Moo.
[355:06.53]No, it's just a very humorous way to spend $26.
[355:08.35]That's like an insane way to spend $26.
[355:11.78]Thank you, though, Sam.
[355:16.66]Thank you, GarfieldTheMondayKiller, for the $1.
[355:18.72]Okay, Jerma, moment of truth.
[355:20.54]Which one was better?
[355:22.26]The first one or this other one that looks like Sesame Street?
[355:25.04]I'm going to be honest.
[355:26.60]It's my own musical, and I don't know how many talents are going to show this stupid play.
[355:30.54]Alright, what do you got now?
[355:34.43]Wait, what is this?
[355:35.47]No, this is... Hold on a second.
[355:41.57]This is real stuff?
[355:42.97]What is going on?
[355:51.62]This is real.
[355:52.30]This stuff is real stuff.
[355:53.40]What the fuck is happening?
[356:04.34]Everyone's favorite Tubby Tabby bounds off the comics page and onto the coterie stage this summer.
[356:10.20]Garfield, the musical with Catitude.
[356:13.26]Celebrate Garfield's birthday with the world's most famous feline and all of his friends.
[356:17.44]This is like an actual play that people do?
[356:19.58]In a brand new musical.
[356:21.40]It's the perfect summer outing for lasagna lovers.
[356:29.01]So that's a play.
[356:29.93]That's like a nationally syndicated play.
[356:43.91]I guess.
[356:51.46]Whatever syndicated means.
[356:53.24]It means exactly what it sounds like.
[356:57.54]It's a spread out, all over the place, under a centralized ruler.
[357:05.63]Somebody dictates where it goes.
[357:14.72]That's what it means.
[357:21.55]He's googling the definition.
[357:22.67]I was not, actually.
[357:23.97]If you heard, I was saying the definition as I was writing it.
[357:26.15]I just wanted to make sure that when I was done saying the definition, that it would be correct.
[357:31.50]And it was.
[357:32.12]There was absolutely nothing incorrect about the statement that I said.
[357:39.28]But thank you, Garfield, for your showing us that it is a real play that multiple, many people do.
[357:44.87]It's like a Broadway play.
[357:46.03]That's... That's just great.
[357:52.26]It's great.
[357:55.18]It is.
[357:56.66]It really is.
[358:00.16]You sound happy.
[358:02.09]It's great.
[358:03.27]It's really great.
[358:08.09]I'm happy that it's people.
[358:10.17]If they're having fun, good.
[358:12.49]I'm glad that they are having a great time.
[358:17.42]Thank you, Garfield of Monday Killer.
[358:19.40]Thank you, Microscope, for the $1.
[358:22.16]Go back to the store and buy a new sandwich on stream.
[358:24.46]It's midnight.
[358:25.06]That's not going to happen, unfortunately.
[358:26.93]Thank you, though.
[358:28.17]Appreciate the $1.
[358:31.61]Much love.
[358:32.91]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[358:34.11]I'm thinking of changing my name on here.
[358:36.35]I came up with it back when I got my Xbox and I thought it was a rad name.
[358:40.11]Do you or any of the sinners in chat have any suggestions?
[358:48.57]I don't know.
[358:52.57]Star Dark.
[358:55.65]It's a rad name.
[358:56.61]Why change it?
[358:57.63]That's true.
[358:58.61]That is already a rad name.
[358:59.89]Garfield 2.
[359:02.59]Dark Star Garfield.
[359:18.21]Who said my name?
[359:20.45]Soon to be somebody else's name.
[359:25.11]I'm not sure, Darkstar.
[359:25.91]Maybe you'll come up with something.
[359:28.69]I am a monk.
[359:29.17]Thanks for $1, Jerma.
[359:30.77]I won't eat this six-hour-old sandwich for a joke.
[359:33.49]Also, Jerma, I was going to drink Star's spit for a joke.
[359:43.30]What's the problem there?
[359:44.34]I don't understand.
[359:46.68]One of those things might get you very sick.
[359:51.53]The other one is what people do every day.
[359:56.87]Like in a roundabout way.
[360:10.00]I'm just gonna say...
[360:12.67]okay so I I have a girlfriend you guys know who she is I kissed that girlfriend I kissed hey gosh I kissed that girl you know what I mean uh if Kim spit in my mouth what's the difference
[360:41.72]Biologically, biochemically, there's no difference.
[360:46.60]I mean, that's gross.
[360:48.12]It's nasty.
[360:48.87]I wouldn't do it.
[360:50.29]But biochemically, down to the level with the M word on it, you know what I mean?
[360:57.49]It's the same.
[360:59.80]A sandwich that is six hours old is not the same biochemical makeup of a sandwich that's new.
[361:06.02]It's old and it has like bacteria and illnesses that you... Okay, look, if somebody was sick and you got a kiss, then yeah.
[361:14.55]You wouldn't get a kiss from somebody that's sick because you didn't want to get sick.
[361:20.03]You wouldn't eat a six to seven year old sandwich because you don't want to get sick.
[361:25.59]It's so easy.
[361:27.01]It's just science.
[361:39.63]Wait, hold on.
[361:40.67]Did I say year?
[361:41.87]I said year.
[361:52.24]Long story short, if somebody spits in your mouth and they're not sick, you're not gonna get sick.
[361:57.10]There is a very high chance that if you eat a six to seven fucking hour old sandwich that was left out in the fucking heat of a car that you're gonna get sick.
[362:05.51]There's a chance there.
[362:07.47]That's not the same thing.
[362:13.78]thank you for the one dollar there's a 10 chance there's like a 10 chance of you getting sick from that sandwich there is a zero percent chance from getting sick of somebody spitting in your mouth if they're not sick that's just basic mathematics of what you've done in the chat on the stream in front of the audience so I don't think we need to discuss that any further
[362:43.87]You can't get mono from a sandwich, but the person has to have mono.
[362:49.64]Why are you just automatically assuming that, like, Star has mono in this scenario?
[363:00.14]Okay, yes.
[363:01.18]Here's how that makes sense.
[363:03.65]If Star walked in here, and I injected him with a serum that gave him, like, a 20% chance to have mono...
[363:12.44]Are you gonna drink that spit?
[363:15.64]No.
[363:18.10]It's the same thing with the sandwich.
[363:19.36]There's like a small chance that I'm gonna get sick from that sandwich.
[363:22.08]Why would I eat it?
[363:31.97]The guy that was just gonna freeze away germs from a sandwich is telling us about science.
[363:35.89]No, that was an experiment.
[363:36.97]That's my hypothetical situation.
[363:39.49]I'm gonna see what happens.
[363:51.47]So would you let someone spit in your mouth normally?
[363:54.19]No.
[363:54.68]But for the purposes of the discussion, that makes sense to talk about it.
[364:00.56]You're digging yourself a deeper and deeper hole?
[364:02.60]No.
[364:03.20]I ain't digging the hole anymore.
[364:04.71]I already got to the core of the Earth.
[364:07.23]And I've colonized it.
[364:10.97]This is all mine in here.
[364:14.31]And I got a bucket that I'm putting Earth core shit in with lava and all these new rocks that no one's ever seen.
[364:21.86]And I'm pulling the levee, I'm pulling the lever up and the bucket's going all the way back up to the crust and it's being sold.
[364:32.74]And then you put like a couple, you put money in the bucket and I bring it back down.
[364:50.20]He's talking about Minecraft.
[364:55.89]We lost him.
[364:57.01]We lost him, boys.
[364:58.07]He's gone.
[365:04.75]It all goes back to Minecraft every time.
[365:07.38]It does.
[365:09.86]Thank you, I'm a monk, though.
[365:11.74]Thank you, Awesome Alec, for the $1.
[365:13.64]Wish me luck on my job interview, and I'll do the same for your move.
[365:17.40]Good luck on that job interview.
[365:21.08]I hope you get insta-hired.
[365:22.18]I hope you walk in the door.
[365:25.76]And... The guy doesn't need... You don't even need to have an interview.
[365:31.04]But you open the door and the guy just goes, Oh, you're perfect!
[365:34.01]Yes!
[365:34.95]Because you have like your resume as a t-shirt.
[365:36.85]That's really important.
[365:39.35]You should have all of your qualifying skills on Times New Roman on your t-shirt.
[365:45.59]And wear a t-shirt.
[365:46.27]Wear a white t-shirt with all of just Times New Roman.
[365:50.51]Don't do that, though.
[365:51.25]But just good luck.
[365:53.01]Hope you get it.
[365:55.65]Thank you, Ganja, again, for the $2.
[365:56.91]I don't know if you saw my bits earlier.
[365:59.50]I have some more.
[366:00.32]It's 6 a.m.
[366:01.08]here.
[366:01.38]Sleep tight, Prince.
[366:04.06]I did.
[366:05.32]I saw them earlier.
[366:06.02]I talked about them a little bit.
[366:07.72]Thank you so much for the extra $2 here.
[366:11.38]Thank you.
[366:12.95]I will have a good sleep.
[366:13.87]I'll try.
[366:16.21]Pocket Pauling, thanks for the $2.
[366:17.61]When's the Uncle Dane mixtape collab?
[366:22.61]I don't know what that is.
[366:28.32]But I'm down here in the center of the Earth.
[366:30.58]I'm down here in the center of the Earth alone here, man.
[366:33.70]I told you guys about collabs.
[366:35.78]If they happen, they happen.
[366:36.90]Just organically.
[366:38.20]I'm down here in the center.
[366:39.16]I'm in the center of the Earth.
[366:47.99]But hopefully his mixtape goes well.
[366:53.06]How hot is it down here?
[366:53.86]It's alright.
[367:00.14]It's like 80.
[367:00.54]85.
[367:01.44]On a hot day.
[367:09.91]Acrobatic skill increased.
[367:11.65]What does that mean?
[367:16.95]I gotta dodge the question?
[367:19.25]What?
[367:20.79]Okay.
[367:21.17]Hold on a second.
[367:23.02]If you walked up to somebody, if you walked up to like an actor, right?
[367:27.18]You walked up to some guy and like, let's say, let's just say you walked up to, uh, like Brad Pitt, right?
[367:32.50]I'm not, I'm not comparing myself to Brad Pitt.
[367:34.46]So you walked up to Brad Pitt and you said, hey, Brad Pitt, um, uh, are you going to be, are you going to be in the next, you're going to be in the next season of Game of Thrones, right?
[367:42.34]He's going to be like, I don't know what the fuck, what?
[367:45.77]Like Brad, Brad, you're going to be on the next season of Game of Thrones?
[367:48.13]The show, that show?
[367:50.45]He's like, I don't know.
[367:51.71]Probably, I don't know.
[367:55.02]Like you're doing now.
[367:56.41]No, I'm just saying, like... Like, I don't know.
[368:01.63]How am I supposed to answer these questions?
[368:08.01]Let's say you walked up to Jeremiah in a Twitch hoodie at Dunkin' Donuts.
[368:10.79]That's a good app, right?
[368:23.87]Hey Jeremy, what watches do you wear?
[368:25.40]I don't have a watch.
[368:26.32]I don't wear a watch.
[368:28.12]It makes my wrist and hand sweat.
[368:30.52]I don't like it.
[368:32.12]They look great, though.
[368:39.86]No, my point is, is that... So you've got like two... Let's just use the word content creator.
[368:46.35]I hate all these words that they... I hate all these words that they've given us as a collective group of people here.
[368:52.00]influencer, you know, uh, online, uh, online media.
[368:56.36]That's what I'm gonna say.
[368:57.08]You got two online medias.
[368:59.60]Or potentially three, or four, or five.
[369:07.59]I have no idea.
[369:09.21]Guys, I don't even know what I'm, I don't know when the next time I'm gonna play with Etalyx will be.
[369:13.69]You know?
[369:15.07]I don't know when I'm gonna be on his TV show, or when he'll be on mine.
[369:17.69]I don't know.
[369:18.83]Just, sometimes you, it's, it just happens.
[369:25.58]We never play again.
[369:26.90]We're gonna live in the same house.
[369:30.56]I can't, oh dude, I can't wait to like epic gamer house prank him.
[369:34.68]It's gonna be so funny.
[369:35.72]He's gonna be in the middle of a stream and I'm gonna like throw popcorn into his room.
[369:45.51]And then he's gonna like, oh, what the fuck?
[369:48.29]I went to, I got mail and I'm gonna open up my mail on stream and it was glitter.
[369:52.21]He got me back.
[369:55.25]If we do that, if that happens one time... Unsubscribe from my channel.
[370:03.74]I don't deserve your viewership anymore.
[370:08.20]Okay?
[370:17.61]Replace his toothpaste with mayonnaise and he goes...
[370:25.83]I'm gonna open up his door and throw like a fart of one of those fart exploders and it's like stinks.
[370:33.99]Please write me a formal letter.

[371:04.52]We're not doing don't know.
[371:05.42]We're not gonna do prank fuck up shit The moral of the story is we're not going to do any prank videos to each other.
[371:13.88]I said we do that I I don't know.
[371:18.51]I can't speak for him But there will never be a prank stream.
[371:23.67]I might open the door and just like scream or something one day.
[371:26.37]I
[371:27.84]But I don't think that's classified as the thing we're talking about.
[371:37.63]Here's how the prank war is going to go down, okay?
[371:39.97]We'll do a prank war, fine.
[371:41.90]But the prank war is us going to be doing incredibly nice things for each other.
[371:47.12]He's going to be streaming and I'm going to open the door and it's going to be like I'm going to sneak up behind him with like a fucking perfect lobster dinner.
[371:54.49]and sit it in front of him and like fucking to be like oh I got him and like get out of the room like then a few days later he's gonna open up my door and like sneak in with already folded laundry of mine and put it down and be like look what I just did that's what you'll get
[372:27.55]Lobster dinner versus doing your laundry.
[372:31.41]But, you know, I'm just throwing out ideas.
