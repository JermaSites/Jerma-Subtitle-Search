[00:09.80]The end.
[00:10.24]Okay.
[00:15.18]Explore the world.
[00:16.30]Let me get this on for you guys.
[00:24.79]We're just gonna chill.
[00:31.33]I gotta change this to, what do I change this to?
[00:42.58]Winding down for a little bit and we'll, is GeoGuessr even on here?
[00:48.60]It is.
[00:59.91]GeoGuessy.
[01:04.38]Okay.
[01:07.18]That should be updated, I think.
[01:09.92]No, I need to capture the window, not the browser.
[01:29.27]Add window.
[01:31.03]There we go.
[01:36.86]Not that one.
[01:37.59]Which one is it?
[01:49.69]Why are there so many processes for this?
[01:53.89]What the hell?
[01:59.66]This is weird.
[02:00.16]Going to have to open this in another window.
[02:07.38]For some strange reason, it doesn't want to work.
[02:18.01]Okay.
[02:18.51]Let's try it again.
[02:31.89]Colon cam.
[02:34.63]Incoming colon cam.
[02:36.84]There it is.
[02:37.50]Alright, that took long enough.
[02:45.64]Alright.
[02:48.68]I see things, I see things.
[02:50.42]Let's try not to get the ads in there though.
[02:57.43]Like, there.
[03:11.27]We could do it without the ever-changing ad.
[03:14.05]Okay.
[03:19.52]And then let me get my camera on.
[03:27.42]That camera's way too big.
[03:32.54]Is this delayed?
[03:35.44]Shouldn't be.
[03:37.57]Hey guys, how are you?
[03:42.81]Let me move this.
[03:43.35]I gotta move the camera.
[03:49.69]To over here.
[03:50.37]Hold on.
[03:51.97]Sorry, I'm moving you around a lot.
[03:58.94]Let me see how that looks.
[04:01.28]How does that look?
[04:03.02]Well, that changed quickly.
[04:13.98]Over here, right?
[04:15.98]Like this?
[04:18.74]Crazy eyes!
[04:19.60]Alright.
[04:22.78]Not in frame.
[04:24.10]I am now.
[04:30.49]And then we're gonna flip me.
[04:31.63]Watch this, ready?
[04:36.35]Take a look!
[04:38.67]Greasy hair?
[04:40.01]It's not greasy, it's just... slippery.
[04:45.33]Okay.
[04:46.17]GeoGuessr, are you ready to play?
[04:49.83]Look, I played Mr. Mosquito for like fucking two hours.
[04:52.09]Of course I'm going to be sweating.
[04:58.98]Alright, we can go.
[04:59.50]Thank you for your patience.
[05:04.10]Let's find out where we are in the world.
[05:09.38]Alright, so we got...
[05:13.50]Uh, walking, walking person.
[05:17.17]Car, what's a car say?
[05:17.99]Let's just walk down the road.
[05:23.33]Somebody said Minecraft birch tree.
[05:28.00]Look out for the car, I'm in a car.
[05:29.50]This is a, what kind of road is this?
[05:31.04]This is a small road, this is not in America.
[05:38.22]Is this two lanes, or is this...
[05:41.91]Did you tell him a car comes down here?
[05:49.58]No, we're on the right side of the road.
[05:53.50]Well, we'll find out.
[05:54.08]If a car comes the other way, then we're not in America.
[05:55.86]But we're definitely not in America anyways.
[05:57.12]What does the sign say?
[06:04.93]Don't walk or crosswalk?
[06:13.23]No, this is definitely not America.
[06:15.63]The road's too narrow.
[06:18.31]But hold on a second here.
[06:19.25]Maybe it is.
[06:34.73]This is... I think this might actually be somewhere in North America.
[06:40.45]That's not a Euro truck.
[06:43.22]That's not a Euro truck.
[06:45.88]This is America.
[06:46.96]This is America.
[06:51.87]Or somewhere in North America.
[06:55.37]We're on the right side of the road.
[06:56.29]Nobody else does that.
[06:58.73]We're one of the places, only places on Earth that does this.
[07:07.16]Keep going.
[07:18.76]What is this person doing?
[07:25.95]This is Russia.
[07:30.21]Passing?
[07:30.71]Who are they passing?
[07:33.31]Who are you passing?
[07:35.93]They were passing the Google truck?
[07:43.44]I was gonna laugh if there was like a finger out the window.
[07:49.79]just couldn't handle it you had to get around the Google truck alright so we're somewhere in Russia Ukraine the aspect ratio is too stretched why because it's like squished alright hold on let me fix this why is this still on
[08:24.53]Is that better?
[08:24.97]I don't want to... Okay, the reason why I don't have the whole thing out here is because I don't want you to see this.
[08:32.58]I don't want you to see all the ads that I have to get.
[08:44.45]That's good.
[08:49.79]That's fine.
[08:52.55]Yeah, that's fine.
[08:53.37]That's fine.
[08:55.17]look ready now you don't even know you can't even tell this looks like we're watching a movie alright so somewhere in Russia definitely not a cold part of Russia everybody's baton people in Russia man you don't want to be behind the Google truck or in front of whatever
[09:28.63]Let me see here.
[09:34.23]Let's just say, because I'm going to say... A lot of green down here.
[09:44.70]It's definitely not up here.
[09:46.44]Let me see if I can get a sign.
[09:49.29]Although I can't read.
[09:51.35]So how am I going to do that?
[09:53.74]Seems like outside of a very major city somehow.
[09:57.48]There's a lot of development over there.
[10:07.37]I'm gonna just stay here.
[10:11.51]Challenge your friends.
[10:12.49]How the economic machine works.
[10:16.99]I don't remember getting ads.
[10:22.30]That wasn't that bad.
[10:23.28]I don't remember getting these ads.
[10:35.59]3,000 kilometers, that's pretty, that's not bad.
[10:38.57]Considering how big Russia is.
[10:39.81]Alright, next round.
[10:49.47]Why are the outsides of the windows blurred but not the part of the window that matters?
[10:53.67]The window part.
[10:59.96]I don't know what you're trying to blur here.
[11:03.70]Alright, let's take a look.
[11:04.56]Let's go down here.
[11:11.14]Dirt road.
[11:15.44]Green, white house with a shed of
[11:20.91]Okay.
[11:24.35]Let's get off the dirt road so I can see.
[11:25.77]This looks like a little European town.
[11:38.36]Oh, another- look, a Euro truck, right?
[11:43.43]Is it a prison?
[11:50.35]What does that say?
[11:53.65]I can't read that.
[11:56.20]I gotta get onto a highway or something, this way.
[12:01.20]Alright, what have we got?
[12:01.78]Okay, hold on.
[12:04.88]Kapampin.
[12:07.34]No, this is also, this is Russia, this is also Russia.
[12:11.26]Is it?
[12:16.86]Is this Russia?
[12:32.24]Russia is always so hard because Russia is so huge.
[12:35.24]Russia is like 30% of the whole Earth.
[12:54.22]Let's go down here, right?
[13:03.29]What is that?
[13:04.81]Oh, I thought that was an animal.
[13:09.83]What are they doing to this house?
[13:17.25]Is it brick?
[13:21.80]Brick laying.
[13:27.48]Interesting.
[13:30.56]Ireland, no, this is not Ireland, this is Russia.
[13:44.52]I can't read that.
[13:47.60]There's nothing... I don't think there's anything there.
[13:49.79]I can't... There's no words there.
[14:02.96]I don't think this is like a major city.
[14:04.66]Maybe this... I'm like stuck on the dirt roads.
[14:15.36]This is... I don't know.
[14:19.12]Let's take a guess.
[14:23.18]Wait.
[14:24.61]Intersection.
[14:34.37]No major city.
[14:35.39]Is it going to be like a town name?
[14:39.57]Like a town center.
[14:40.36]Okay, hold on.
[14:40.78]What's this?
[14:46.04]Bank.
[14:47.46]That's a bank?
[14:50.66]Bank of... Ben?
[15:07.13]Bank of Russia.
[15:08.74]I don't think it's Bank of Russia.
[15:14.78]What about down here?
[15:15.30]Hold on.
[15:30.43]The thing about Russian, maybe it's just because of the alphabet, right?
[15:35.15]We use the same alphabet.
[15:37.79]But I feel like I'm looking at words in a dream.
[15:49.65]You know what I mean?
[15:50.19]Like, I feel like I'm just, it's so upside down and backwards in my brain.
[15:58.22]Like, when I'm in a dream, I feel like this is what the letters look like in my brain.
[16:08.39]Next time you have a dream, wake up.
[16:11.79]Next time you have a dream, open up a book.
[16:14.63]You'll see.
[16:14.95]Alright, I'm going for it.
[16:24.31]Same place I guessed last time.
[16:27.11]That's like the same exact spot.
[16:34.34]It was the same spot.
[16:35.80]It was just over here.
[16:37.18]No, I didn't, what am I clicking on?
[16:40.08]Why did it just load up an ad?
[16:42.32]It just like forced me into an ad.
[16:43.70]Alright, here we go.
[16:59.43]Turn on your ad block.
[17:00.19]Does this site open with an ad block?
[17:02.64]Is it Russia again?
[17:03.32]I don't know about that.
[17:04.38]This might not be Russia.
[17:12.00]This looks American.
[17:21.02]Yeah.
[17:22.52]This is definitely American.
[17:25.30]Somewhere in the Midwest.
[17:28.16]Give me a street sign.
[17:31.02]Give me a name.
[17:31.72]Give me a name.
[17:32.16]Anything.
[17:32.50]Stop ahead.
[17:33.48]We're in America.
[17:39.12]Only in America will it warn you to make sure you understand that you need to stop at a stop sign.
[17:44.63]Only in America is that possible.
[17:48.73]There's a stop sign before the stop sign.
[17:56.06]Divided highway.
[17:56.92]Okay.
[18:00.38]That's a warning stop sign.
[18:04.23]American town in Russia.
[18:13.53]Oh, we've got Westby.
[18:18.12]That could be anything though.
[18:19.26]Westby.
[18:21.04]But no, wait.
[18:21.92]Population, 2,200 people.
[18:28.00]This is the middle of nowhere somewhere in the Midwest.
[18:36.22]Can we get a state, though?
[18:38.06]Come on, let's go.
[18:38.68]Old Town Motel Restaurant.
[18:42.02]There we go.
[18:42.61]Kansas is finest.
[18:44.41]Come on, right?
[18:47.93]Can't see.
[18:51.61]No.
[18:52.25]Galaxy?
[18:54.97]What about this side?
[18:55.97]Oh, hold on.
[18:58.45]Madison?
[19:01.33]Wisconsin.
[19:02.05]Is this Wisconsin?
[19:04.51]Madison, Wisconsin?
[19:07.73]So if Madison's 104 miles that way, where's Madison?
[19:21.24]Where is Madison, Wisconsin?
[19:27.75]Madison, it's 100 miles off of Madison.
[19:33.69]Which way are we facing right now?
[19:35.69]This is important.
[19:37.54]That's my compass.
[19:41.34]So this is south.
[19:44.68]So we're going red means it's pointing, right?
[19:48.17]So this is south.
[19:52.01]This is like southeast.
[19:59.85]Wait, what do you mean?
[20:02.30]The red is the indicator, right?
[20:07.51]Or is white the indicator?
[20:14.60]Red is north.
[20:21.36]Why would north... isn't north up here?
[20:28.59]North is up.
[20:35.29]So this is north...
[20:37.90]This is northwest.
[20:42.16]So this is 104 miles northwest of Madison.
[20:47.65]I don't use fucking compasses.
[20:53.83]Okay.
[20:54.99]Let's find Westby.
[20:56.03]So we have 104 miles northwest.
[21:00.45]Westby.
[21:03.65]How much 104 miles is fucking up here, isn't it?
[21:08.50]Westby.
[21:09.72]Westby.
[21:11.80]Up here somewhere.
[21:15.13]Further.
[21:16.29]Westby.
[21:26.44]What road is this?
[21:29.42]If it's 104 miles on this road.
[21:29.98]What road?
[21:30.32]14, 12...
[21:38.61]This might be 12, 18, 14.
[21:42.53]I'm going to say like right up here.
[21:59.88]Warrens, Tomas, Barta, Whitehall.
[22:08.93]Melrose.
[22:12.93]Come on, it's like up here.
[22:16.72]Did I miss it?
[22:22.18]Wilton.
[22:28.19]Jefferson, cast in Ontario.
[22:45.90]5,000 points.
[22:50.00]Didn't get it by the street?
[22:53.20]I'm not looking to get it perfect.
[22:59.11]Did you enjoy this location?
[23:01.41]I've never been there.
[23:02.05]Alright, that was good.
[23:04.93]That was a good round.
[23:07.71]Hoots.
[23:09.09]Health Mart Pharmacy.
[23:10.67]Hoots.
[23:12.23]Still in America, I think.
[23:14.34]Let's find a city or a town center or something.
[23:24.49]Wilensky's.
[23:27.23]Wisconsin.
[23:28.31]No.
[23:28.95]Wilensky's Brothers.
[23:39.25]Saba, what is it?
[23:41.19]Head start, San Saba, what's?
[23:47.52]Wait, maybe, no, no, no, no, hold on.
[23:57.97]What's down here, Bella?
[24:00.91]Oh, apparently not.
[24:04.35]Why would they blur that out, but then not blur it out?
[24:08.15]Okay, so this is obviously somewhere in America.
[24:16.99]Let's go up here.
[24:22.45]I'm not ready to take a guess.
[24:23.47]Decker?
[24:24.97]Decker Street.
[24:30.16]Recreation Club.
[24:31.46]The Busy Bee.
[24:34.04]Smart.
[24:34.36]This is all boarded up.
[24:36.82]Recreation club.
[24:38.14]Okay, we're in Menard.
[24:42.90]Where is Menard?
[24:51.23]Looks like there's a school down here.
[24:52.19]Maybe they'll get a town name.
[24:54.45]Is it a pool?
[24:57.41]It's out here.
[24:59.15]Hold on.
[24:59.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[25:01.99]Menard Manor?
[25:07.54]Hotel in Menard Manor.
[25:09.12]Let me go down here.
[25:14.27]Wait.
[25:16.77]School.
[25:17.19]We love our children.
[25:18.27]Drive slow.
[25:19.09]Is it a church or a temple or
[25:42.34]Go over here.
[25:47.32]I can't go down there?
[25:47.98]Alright, what about the school?
[25:49.66]Wait, hold on.
[25:50.82]The Menard News!
[25:52.29]A lot of these places love to have the name of where you are in the title of their... What's this?

[26:30.42]That was one, two, three, four.
[26:32.60]Oh.
[26:39.84]The elementary school.
[26:45.23]I think we're going off here.
[27:08.67]Whoa, that doesn't make me puke.
[27:16.75]I gotta get back to the businesses.
[27:21.63]It's definitely somewhere down south.
[27:23.68]Has to be.
[27:26.88]I went way too far away.
[27:28.58]I gotta go back.
[27:43.98]Bowie.
[27:56.14]Okay.
[27:57.08]Back over here.
[27:57.62]I'm going to go all the way back.
[28:14.55]Menard News.
[28:17.90]I feel like I can get this one.
[28:22.38]Jackets rule.
[28:26.41]These places don't even have a thing on them.
[28:48.89]Wait.
[28:50.77]First United Methodist Church.

[29:51.10]Look at right there, hold on.
[29:53.54]Look at the little blip that's right there on the map.
[29:55.46]You see that?
[29:57.46]So like right here?
[30:03.22]So that's here.
[30:03.80]Not very many towns here.
[30:16.93]Maynard.
[30:22.70]Maynard.
[30:23.28]Did anybody see it?
[30:27.92]It's like right here.
[30:46.89]Fucking told you the blip was gonna help us here.
[30:51.78]Alright, so hold on a minute here.
[30:53.58]Let's get this 100% accurate.
[30:58.42]Maynard Manor.
[31:00.21]Right here.
[31:01.37]I'm gonna go stand at Maynard Manor.
[31:08.71]And I'm gonna get 5,000 points.
[31:10.69]This is 100%.
[31:13.24]I'm literally standing out the front door of Maynard Manor.
[31:17.22]We're here.
[31:17.88]We made it.
[31:25.18]Wait, it's where you started.
[31:26.38]It's based on where you spawned.
[31:30.33]I don't remember even where I spawned.
[31:34.45]Starting location?
[31:35.77]That was up here and to the left, right?
[31:37.25]So if we're looking at Minard Manor, we go to the left.
[31:42.88]To the left.
[31:46.18]Now we're on 2092.
[31:50.86]Press the flag.
[31:55.49]Okay.
[31:55.83]Alright.
[31:56.13]Alright.
[31:56.45]Okay.
[31:57.39]I know I had it right.
[31:58.85]The stairs, Maynard Manor.
[32:01.03]We're like right here.
[32:02.31]First State Bank.
[32:05.61]It's like right here.
[32:09.06]Ranch House Meat Company.
[32:10.92]Hoots.
[32:14.14]First State Bank.
[32:17.98]Chamber of Commerce.
[32:28.13]It's right there.
[32:37.69]It was like 10 feet.
[32:40.81]5,000 points.
[32:44.47]That was a good one.
[32:45.29]That was two good ones back to back.
[32:51.18]Harry Potter and the Chamber of Commerce.
[32:54.20]That would be a real boring fucking movie.
[32:55.76]Alright, another sign.
[33:07.07]It said Maynard.
[33:08.15]That would be if it was... I hate being out in the middle of nowhere because you almost just have to go in a straight line to get to a junction of civilization.
[33:21.16]There are no houses out here.
[33:23.90]There's nothing even out here.
[33:26.14]Look, one guy lives out here.
[33:27.94]Yeah, one guy lives out here.
[33:29.22]You know what I think is really weird about something like GeoGuessr?
[33:44.71]Is the amount of, probably the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people that have played this game.
[33:52.13]The millions of clicks and the millions of refreshing and new locations.
[33:57.14]How many times has somebody walked by your house?
[34:04.74]How many people have looked in your window?
[34:09.03]That's weird.
[34:17.44]You were in my hometown last time you played.
[34:20.30]See, that's... That's crazy.
[34:30.39]Wait, what?
[34:31.23]What's going on?
[34:31.75]What happened in chat?
[34:39.77]I was in your house the last time I played.
[34:45.92]What does it put?
[34:46.90]Creepypasta?
[34:47.60]I don't understand.
[34:48.12]Is somebody trying to put in creepypastas?
[35:06.01]People are posting creepy ASCII art.
[35:08.21]It's a meme thing.
[35:19.01]Do that in your own house.
[35:22.45]Hey, do that in your own house.
[35:42.57]I answered my answer.
[35:52.20]Alright, what do we got here?
[35:53.56]TWP Road Sandio Oh my god, what is over here?
[36:06.11]What is stored in there?
[36:13.65]What is over there?
[36:24.03]It's- it's Khorne.
[36:42.80]It just like hurts my eyes.
[36:43.66]I don't like the resolution in this city, whatever it is.
[36:47.58]I got the bad graphics settings in this city.
[36:59.86]What's that?
[37:01.34]Something up here.
[37:05.37]I can't even go this far.
[37:07.27]Why does it end here?
[37:10.99]Was the Google truck afraid to go down here?
[37:20.04]Alright, that was weird.
[37:22.12]End of the world.
[37:24.72]We're gonna get to the end, we're gonna get to go look over and see the space!
[37:31.10]It's the end of the Earth!
[37:45.19]You're gonna go- you're gonna go like- WOAH!
[37:47.39]WOAH!
[37:56.44]I have no idea where the hell I am.
[38:08.02]The Earth is shaped like a velociraptor.
[38:10.14]That's just the thing I don't understand.
[38:18.84]Is if the Earth is 70% water, why doesn't it just fall out and go into space?
[38:24.86]When you pour a glass of water, it goes straight down and spills all over the place.
[38:29.26]So if we're 70% water and we're, you know, like, why is the water not just out in space?
[39:00.28]Earth's mass holds the water here with gravity.
[39:07.03]I don't know about that.
[39:08.97]Gravity is something I put on my potatoes, and you're telling me that's... Yeah, you also put that delicious, tasty thing on.
[39:14.82]That's what's keeping us together.
[39:15.84]Uh-huh.
[39:17.94]Okay.
[39:33.63]Got some scientists here.
[39:39.59]Are you fucking weirdos still doing ASCII art here?
[39:51.16]Don't make me bring out the mallet.
[39:52.54]I'll bring out the hammer.
[40:04.03]I don't know who the fuck I am.
[40:12.86]Sub mode?
[40:13.76]Uh-oh.
[40:15.06]He's about to put it in sub mode.
[40:20.36]Maybe if you're good, I won't have to do it.
[40:27.58]Subs are doing it too.
[40:30.78]I am okay with...
[40:33.74]If you're a sub, that doesn't mean that you get to break rules and spam and just because you're a subscriber, you still gotta follow the rules.
[40:42.32]They're down there in the description.
[40:46.34]Just because somebody gave a lot of money.
[40:48.66]What?
[40:50.31]Yeah, they did.
[40:52.31]Holy shit.
[40:52.79]Frodeon Weapon, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[40:56.27]$50 from Frodeon Weapon.
[40:57.05]5,000 bits.
[41:00.22]Gravy is what keeps us together.
[41:02.60]I love the chill parts of these streams.
[41:04.10]Yeah.
[41:06.36]Thank you for the 50 fucking dollars, man.
[41:08.32]5,000 bits.
[41:08.84]It's a lot.
[41:11.38]We've had a couple of just kind of chill hangout streams recently.
[41:17.08]Sometimes you gotta just slow it down, right?
[41:29.32]Alright, it might be time to turn on sub-only mode.
[41:33.43]You know.
[41:38.47]Nah.
[41:43.65]No, you've done it.
[41:47.27]Sorry, I mean, we gotta control it somehow.
[41:49.55]I mean... Alright, everyone slow down, everyone calm down.
[42:05.06]Alright, I need to find out where I am.
[42:06.94]What do they got in there?
[42:09.85]Monkey eggs!
[42:12.61]Wrestling?
[42:13.31]Chief wrestling?
[42:15.51]Chief wrestling.
[42:18.37]Chief West... West-ins.
[42:20.55]West-ins?
[42:34.50]Juno Upseto just gave five community subs.
[42:37.36]Thank you, Juno Upseto, for the five community subs.
[42:48.52]That's a lot of subs, thank you.
[42:51.44]Alright, we just, Russia is like impossible.

[42:57.17]It seriously is.
[42:58.25]Look at these.
[42:59.35]Bang, bang, bang.
[43:00.83]Where are you in Russia?
[43:01.99]Who has any idea?
[43:13.51]Let's do it again.
[43:16.26]New map.
[43:17.88]New zone.
[43:23.08]Now where is this?
[43:26.78]I don't think this is Russia.
[43:35.51]Why is there just a car here?
[43:38.99]Is this car just abandoned?
[43:40.45]Why is there a car just pulled over?
[43:41.81]Are there people?
[43:44.40]Five more community subs from Lorag.
[43:47.50]Lorag98, thanks for the five subs.
[43:54.03]Where's the person whose car this belongs to?
[44:00.27]I don't know.
[44:00.95]How would you... Oh my god, Jesus.
[44:04.58]Not so crippling depression.
[44:07.00]Thanks for the ten community subs on top of the other ones that have already come in.

[46:07.74]Oh my god, that's fucking so funny.
[46:10.08]Alright, I need to find a sign.
[46:16.12]Sign.
[46:17.82]What does that say?
[46:19.22]You are now in...
[46:22.96]Delaware!
[46:24.41]Regulon.
[46:26.69]Alright, this is... Uh, Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[46:29.99]Thanks for the five community subs.
[46:31.51]Five?
[46:33.17]Five more from Mostly Lost.
[46:34.57]Another five.
[46:38.98]Five from Mostly Lost, five from Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[46:44.14]Alright, there's an ad down here that it's trying to tell me how much money I have.
[46:49.63]It's giving me like a bank account number.
[46:53.73]What is the... I don't understand this.
[46:57.90]It's... Since 4th to 7th April, it's gone.
[47:02.30]No, it reloaded.
[47:03.08]What is this?
[47:04.52]Why is this... Tax included.
[47:05.96]Oh, no, that's how much the plane costs.
[47:09.60]Should I book it?
[47:12.06]$770 to Argentina.
[47:12.92]Tax included.
[47:13.62]That sounds pretty good. $37...
[47:22.42]Destininos?
[47:23.50]Destinos?
[47:25.34]What money is that?
[47:26.06]What currency is that?
[47:29.54]37 Destinos.
[47:30.98]What is that in US dollars?
[47:36.51]Pretty good deal.
[47:39.85]Jeff, five community subs.
[47:43.11]Thank you, Jeff.
[47:46.21]Five community subs from Bingo Sunshine.
[47:50.33]You have to geo-guess.
[47:53.99]Bingo Sunshine 5.
[47:55.55]Here comes like the 50 to 100 subs.
[48:00.93]You guys are fucking too much.
[48:02.00]Thank you.
[48:04.82]I need to find out where the hell I am.
[48:10.42]Got it.
[48:11.16]Watch this one.
[48:17.02]E.F.M.
[48:18.98]Lociers Off-Road.
[48:22.79]Uh, 4x4 doesn't give us a name though.
[48:34.92]I kind of want to get back onto that main road.
[48:41.20]You're baiting subs with GeoGuessr mind tricks.
[48:47.10]No, I put it in sub only mode because people were like ASCII art spamming.
[48:55.89]That's what happened.
[48:56.73]Is this France?
[48:58.91]I don't think this is, no.
[48:59.83]I don't think this is France.
[49:03.72]This might be Latin America.
[49:19.23]Alright, you guys can behave.
[49:20.59]Behave.
[49:26.17]Just behave.
[49:28.31]You need to be on good behavior.
[49:37.56]At the end of the year, the twitch.tv awards ceremony, that happens.
[49:44.02]People are going to reference this.
[49:45.16]I'm not going to get nominated like I did last year for most well-behaved chat of 2019.
[49:49.85]I really, really hope we were going to get that award, but
[49:56.02]The academy will look back and they'll say, oh, remember when they were spamming Momo in the chat that time?
[50:11.67]I can't even go this way.
[50:13.39]This place is off limits.
[50:18.03]Why is that off limits?
[50:32.93]It's a private road.
[50:36.13]How do you even fit a car down here?
[50:41.31]Sorry, Jeremiah, I can't let this go.
[50:42.53]Destinos means destinations is not a currency.
[50:44.97]What are you guys doing?
[50:52.16]ASCII gets you 30 minutes.
[50:53.60]Oh, I would, oh, be careful then.
[50:56.42]ASCII is now 30 minutes.
[51:01.23]That's a monkaS. Unless you want to be timed up for 30 minutes, and there you go.
[51:22.08]Fire Hydrant.
[51:27.56]This chat is a mess, Jeremy Elbertson.
[51:29.66]Contain it.
[51:30.34]I'm trying to tell you.
[51:33.10]I'm containing it now.
[51:36.03]30 minutes for ASCII.
[51:38.55]30 minutes for asking me about ASCII.
[51:43.75]30 minutes for the escape key.
[52:14.96]Somebody said, it's called GeoGuessr.
[52:17.80]Not walk around in a circle till you see a sign.
[52:20.57]For ten minutes.
[52:23.07]I'm currently... Alright, look.
[52:25.01]Did you see how perfect my last few scores were?
[52:27.91]I'm currently dealing with an unruly chat.
[52:30.84]And I'm trying to, like, dodge and quell an uprising here.
[52:39.60]Where are we?
[52:40.82]Larkhan.
[52:49.51]There's like a gnome and Momo ASCII uprising in my chat right now.
[52:53.45]What do you mean don't put this on chat?
[53:01.31]I didn't do it.
[53:01.93]I'm like pasting ASCII.
[53:13.38]I didn't either.
[53:14.14]Here we go.
[53:20.44]Point tourism.
[53:22.51]So tour agency sports
[53:42.11]Restoration.
[53:51.55]Defibrillator.
[53:52.31]There's a defibrillator inside the building.
[53:55.78]Tourisme.
[53:59.46]Okay.
[54:02.12]We got it.
[54:25.68]30% off!
[54:32.80]My whole fucking head hurts now.
[54:40.08]This game has a headache.
[54:42.44]I got it, though.
[54:46.82]It's like cold back here, down into my spine.
[54:50.50]I just pogged myself to death.
[55:07.50]That was pretty good, though.
[55:08.20]That was close.
[55:14.65]You got concussed.
[55:16.75]I just gave myself a concussion.
[55:21.10]He's turning into a Twitch streamer?
[55:23.22]Yeah, I'm morphing.
[55:35.49]33 years old.
[55:36.02]I know.
[55:37.20]I know.
[55:38.84]Trust me.
[55:39.30]I ask and answer that same question every day.
[55:47.22]I know.
[55:52.23]Here's the thing.
[55:52.71]Sooner or later, I'm going to have to start dressing.
[55:55.39]I can't wear a Captain America t-shirt in five years.
[55:59.25]Can I?
[56:00.89]If I'm 40, do I have to wear...
[56:04.62]Vests and jeans.
[56:06.84]I have to wear like slacks with a button-up shirt.
[56:16.03]I don't want to do that.
[56:21.78]What am I?
[56:22.18]What am I?
[56:22.56]My dad or something?
[56:23.80]What am I?
[56:24.28]Dad?
[56:36.07]There's a lake there.
[56:37.17]There's a very long... There's a very long lake that water runs forward in.
[56:43.69]Long, forward-running lake.
[56:53.78]You guys are way too easy.
[56:55.74]It's too easy sometimes.
[56:56.72]It really is.
[57:08.79]How do I do it?
[57:09.21]You gotta lift your head up and go.
[57:16.04]When do I plan on ending my streaming career?
[57:20.78]Haven't thought about that.
[57:24.56]When I'm no longer having fun.
[57:29.17]That's real.
[57:31.85]When I'm no longer enjoying what I'm doing.
[57:33.95]When I'm not having fun anymore.
[57:35.15]When I'm not enjoying it anymore.
[57:36.77]I'm not gonna do it.
[57:46.27]You know, I'm not going to give you, there's no time limit there.
[57:50.63]That could be in 10 years.
[57:51.79]That could be in two years, six months.
[57:55.11]It could be tomorrow.
[57:56.09]I could wake up tomorrow and be like, well, not tomorrow.
[58:09.17]Don't do it tomorrow.
[58:09.95]Tomorrow's my birthday.
[58:15.75]No, I would... Okay, look.
[58:17.48]We would do... Here's what's going to happen.
[58:19.66]I know it's not called GeoGuessery.
[58:21.14]It's called GeoGuessery.
[58:21.84]Don't fucking stand there and talk about your life story.
[58:23.82]I know.
[58:24.30]But listen.
[58:25.70]When I'm done, I will make it very clear.
[58:29.86]I'll make it incredibly clear.
[58:32.10]I'm going to be like, guys, we've had a really, really great time.
[58:35.68]I've been doing this for like 25 years.
[58:38.87]I'd like to spend some time with my seven children.
[58:43.43]You know?
[58:45.07]Dave.
[58:45.89]Danielle.
[58:50.75]Dave.

[59:14.05]And...
[59:32.01]Dick.
[59:36.89]But you'll know.
[59:44.01]I will have a retirement party.
[59:54.44]We're gonna have a retirement party for me.
[60:08.94]Not tomorrow.
[60:09.68]I just went through the world.
[60:10.80]Dude, I teleported through the map.
[60:15.17]Prip.
[60:18.61]Barberville?
[60:20.75]Bar- Stop doing that.
[60:23.31]Stop!
[60:23.75]What the hell?
[60:24.20]Let me see this.
[60:26.10]Oh my god.
[60:27.56]Like, bug in the fucking game's code.
[60:32.08]They're like, the collision detection in this part of the world is just not very good.
[60:40.26]Okay, it was Barberville.
[60:42.44]But no, to be... No fucking around and no joking around.
[60:47.60]When I'm done, whenever that is, I'll give everybody plenty of notice because what I don't want to have happen is to be like, Oh, hey, guys, I'm done.
[60:57.46]I'll see you later.
[60:57.96]I mean, there are people that like, you know, maybe just to subscribe to something.
[61:01.74]Like, I want to give you like a long time to know that's coming.
[61:07.27]But I don't... Just whenever that happens, it happens.
[61:16.96]I don't foresee it happening for a while.
[61:24.71]Don't say anything and just disappear for five years.
[61:27.35]What?
[61:32.83]Burning out?
[61:33.41]I... I spend a very large amount of my energy making sure I don't burn out.
[61:42.49]Injured?
[61:46.54]Is this Vegas?
[61:48.40]Those are everywhere.
[61:52.02]Anti-burnout.
[61:53.04]Yeah.
[62:07.23]Yeah, I mean, you guys know that.
[62:09.61]I take a lot of time off.
[62:12.12]You know, like, for instance, after this, I'm going to just take two days off.
[62:18.05]That's not because I just want to make sure that I'm like, ready to go.
[62:20.83]You know, I take time off each week.
[62:26.77]To specifically to prevent the feeling of like burning out and being like, I got a stream.
[62:32.90]I want to do this.
[62:33.52]I want to do that.
[62:34.16]I'm getting it's too much.
[62:35.42]It's too much.
[62:35.86]It's too much.
[62:40.56]Because it can that can happen.
[62:42.14]What does that say?
[62:48.21]this is like home of 2015 junior olympic gold medalist in gymnastics I don't know who that is what about the next one home of Brian kilgore original bad boy mma 2011 hall of fame

[63:45.64]It's going to happen.
[63:48.54]Just wait until I got my own casino.

[64:01.37]No, I'm not going to say Mokka S again.
[64:13.63]I have my guess.
[64:30.17]That was so close.
[64:33.17]Oh, we did it again.
[64:34.69]I can sell it.
[64:54.53]I can put an M in there after the S. I can taste it.
[65:01.04]Kibidome.
[65:11.30]This looks kind of like New England.
[65:17.68]It does.
[65:17.96]I feel like I'm in New England.
[65:29.47]Did I recognize anything?
[65:39.06]Subs go that way.
[65:41.34]Student recs, I'm in like a college.
[65:43.98]What college am I in?
[65:51.21]This is a college.
[65:58.43]Stadium, University of Idaho.
[66:02.88]Alright, where's the University of Idaho?
[66:07.49]I don't really feel like I'm in New England.
[66:10.61]Where's the University of Idaho?
[66:18.80]I know it's in Idaho.
[66:20.48]What are you looking at?
[66:26.29]I love how they've blurred this out too.
[66:42.59]Campus walk.
[66:47.33]Whoa.
[66:52.18]What a cool campus.
[66:53.52]This is just basketball hoops on the walk?
[67:08.95]In my college, we just played a game of who could
[67:15.51]Put the head in the trash can the longest.
[67:19.57]Without throwing up.
[67:22.26]That's all we had.
[67:32.16]No, of course I didn't win.
[67:34.87]No, this is not a drinking thing.
[67:37.11]This is just a thing thing.
[67:38.27]It's like, ah, I'm bored.
[67:41.03]Me, I'm bored too.
[67:42.13]I'm very bored.
[67:44.18]You want to play Smell the Can?
[67:48.02]Yeah, sure.
[67:48.74]I don't got class for another 40 minutes.
[67:57.82]I need a city.
[68:04.44]Is it going to be admissions or something?
[68:06.28]Teaching and Learning Center.
[68:07.49]Why don't you just name this the Education Center?
[68:13.70]Isn't that too wordy?
[68:15.48]The Teaching and Learning Center?
[68:17.54]The Education Center.
[68:22.41]Too many words.
[68:34.42]Idaho Comm... I got to get out of the college.
[68:41.86]It was like the exit.
[68:42.88]I gotta find the signs and find the exit.
[68:45.26]Is this campus walk?
[68:46.64]No.
[68:47.43]It's over here.
[68:49.03]Life Sciences.
[68:54.73]This way.
[69:00.18]University... Let's get out.
[69:02.98]Out.
[69:07.00]Out.
[69:07.18]Out.
[69:10.96]University... Get out.
[69:23.31]Admission... No, get me out of the college.
[69:30.82]How big is this college?
[69:35.10]Alright, I made it.
[69:37.83]Welcome to Moscow, Moscow, Idaho.
[69:46.92]Okay.
[69:50.64]So it is Russia.
[69:52.46]We were right every time.
[69:59.14]Watch this be actually in Russia.
[70:01.80]No, that would be impossible.
[70:03.92]Alright, Moscow, Idaho.
[70:05.34]Let's go look it up.
[70:10.06]What do you guys think?
[70:11.06]Do you think it's... I'm just realizing this right now.
[70:15.09]Idaho is just a gigantic flip to New Hampshire.
[70:30.08]It's weird.
[70:32.46]Moscow.
[70:33.24]Okay, Moscow.
[70:35.98]We're looking for Moscow.
[70:36.50]Moscow.
[70:39.67]Oh, get out of here, university.
[70:42.83]Where is it?
[70:44.25]University of Idaho.
[70:45.25]I'll take 5,000 points, please.
[70:56.78]Alright, that's close enough.
[71:09.99]What's going on here?
[71:12.77]Somebody ran my camera over with a green tire.
[71:19.33]Why did we get slimed?
[71:27.98]This camera's broken.
[71:32.90]55 speed limit.
[71:46.11]No, that's too easy to do that.
[71:49.57]It's too easy to just bait everybody here to say like, oh, look at those dogs or something.
[71:55.09]Like, everyone's gonna be like, what?
[71:57.73]That's way too easy.
[72:01.11]Look at those lions.
[72:06.80]This camera is pissing me off.
[72:12.04]Road may flood.
[72:21.04]This really is just almost like concrete how flat this all is.
[72:29.80]Yeah, you get like the urge to just sprint just this way.
[72:37.11]Just drink a bunch of water and just run as fast as you fucking possibly can that way.
[72:51.43]Or just like a sled.
[72:53.70]You know one of those body boogie board sleds?
[72:57.46]Just cover it in oil and just sprint as fast as you fucking can.
[73:01.00]And just jump and slide and you'll probably go the whole thing.
[73:10.53]You know, go get in a bowling alley, cover your- you cover the bowling alley or bed thing with oil and slide on it.
[73:15.87]I made this fucking joke two days ago.
[73:18.39]Except it was a much smaller scale.
[73:27.62]Have we got signs?
[73:28.86]No.
[73:30.44]Yeah, this is out... This is out, like, here somewhere.
[73:35.81]This is like... Who fucking has any idea?
[73:43.91]We could be on this road for miles.
[73:48.55]This is scary to... Alright.
[73:51.40]Those of you guys that live in a place like this, in an area like this,
[73:56.13]Aren't you afraid to go anywhere?
[74:01.37]You need a full tank of gas.
[74:07.17]If you don't have a full tank... This is scary.
[74:12.33]Even if you have a full tank of gas.
[74:20.38]Something happens out here.
[74:21.34]Where are you going to go?
[74:22.38]Are you going to walk?
[74:31.96]You better get your sprinting ability up because you're gonna have to go that way.
[74:39.01]Okay, is it, okay.
[74:40.65]I would feel like I would want like extra gas.
[74:50.33]It'd be terrifying.
[74:51.43]Oh, fill the tank up.
[74:55.61]Just can I put like six tanks of gas in my backseat?
[75:01.99]I would be scared to do this.
[75:04.37]I would.
[75:04.71]I would be scared.
[75:05.27]I'd be scared.
[75:05.81]Kent.
[75:16.83]We are in Kent.
[75:19.62]Kent, Nebraska or something.
[75:20.90]Kent, Nebraska.
[75:22.86]Kent.
[75:28.74]Okay, we're in Kent, but where?
[75:31.90]What is Kent?
[75:43.00]What is that?
[75:43.82]Is this a homemade helicopter?
[75:52.51]This is a flying machine.
[75:54.03]This is a homemade flying machine!
[75:57.89]Oh, no, it's perspective.
[75:59.95]It's going that way.
[76:00.79]Okay.
[76:02.13]I thought this was, like, one unit.
[76:05.15]Look, I thought this was one thing.
[76:09.78]Okay, no, it's just like a watering centipede.
[76:14.30]It's a centipede irrigator.
[76:16.20]I get it.
[76:23.31]Look at those dogs.
[76:25.03]Look at those dogs.
[76:39.95]Kent.
[76:44.13]A human irrigator?
[76:45.25]What would a human irrigator be?
[76:50.82]This way or that way?
[76:57.50]Would you like just put water in your mouth and just spray it?
[77:05.87]Alright, time to take a guess.
[77:06.98]I think this is like somewhere in like Oklahoma, Kentucky, Dakota, one of the Dakotas.
[77:15.06]What's that say?
[77:18.90]Does that say Alabama?
[77:23.21]Does that say Alabama dot Alabama?
[77:30.59]Alabama?
[77:31.91]Oh, it's right here.
[77:33.58]North.
[77:36.73]I can't see.
[77:42.71]Oh, train!
[77:44.70]That was bad.
[77:46.00]I know.
[77:48.96]Look, people are just doing ASCII art in the channel, and I've been paying attention to that.
[78:09.72]No joke, until I was 17, I thought it was Abba Llama.
[78:22.24]No, no, not me.
[78:23.34]Somebody in chat said that.
[78:24.81]I'm repeating what somebody said.
[78:28.59]Speaking of llamas, here they are.
[78:29.91]That's a lot of them.
[78:38.54]What does that sign say?
[78:39.75]I'm about to give up and just fucking guess.
[78:51.37]Arcadia, Kansas!
[78:54.78]Arcadia, Kansas.
[78:59.46]Arcadia.
[79:06.08]This is a long road.
[79:07.43]I'm gonna say over here... Arcadia.
[79:14.49]Topeka.
[79:19.76]Arcadia.
[79:22.92]California.
[79:44.22]Garden City, Dodge City, Jacksmoor.
[80:13.04]This is Missouri.
[80:18.69]Oh, there's the Liberal.
[80:20.25]Okay.
[80:22.01]So we weren't in something called Kent.
[80:27.67]It was close.
[80:28.33]Close enough.
[80:32.05]We go that way.
[80:33.05]We've got to turn.
[80:33.69]We're going to go backwards now.
[80:49.60]Okay, this is Russia.
[80:52.72]Again, same signs.
[80:53.90]Remember these signs?
[80:55.64]Russia.
[80:57.32]Yep.
[80:59.70]Good luck.
[81:04.88]Yeah, those are universal Russian signs.
[81:14.75]I don't know.
[81:15.45]I have no idea what that is.
[81:20.97]I don't know what that means.
[81:22.57]Does this mean that cars are coming real- Okay, here's what I get from this.
[81:27.24]Cars on the other side of the road have a much higher speed limit than our side here.
[81:33.60]So cars on this side are gonna be going like 80.
[81:36.18]So be aware of that because it's like 25-30 on this side.
[81:42.31]And the top is just like a wine bottle.
[81:49.34]Or does that, okay, so that means that the road narrows to a point where you have to go like one mile per hour through a tiny little opening.
[82:10.59]More just like cars on the side of the road.
[82:16.43]Who owns these cars?
[82:23.58]There's nothing from miles.
[82:26.76]This is this person's house?
[82:38.97]That's squished.
[82:45.92]What does this one say?
[82:47.88]This says...
[82:55.79]300 miles to I don't I don't know What the hell are they talking about if you drink two cups of coffee a day it helps with dry eyes and
[83:24.41]Wasn't that bad.
[83:28.09]This is Ukraine.
[83:30.93]Alright.

[106:36.91]Yeah, it does.
[106:42.44]Thank you to CAD for the amazing Jerma Slots game.
[106:45.98]There was a lot more content in there than I think any of us ever could have imagined.
[106:49.22]So... Thank you to those of you that worked on that game.
[106:53.36]It was great.
[106:54.72]Mr. Mosquito was actually really interesting.
[107:00.12]until that last level but yeah uh and then yeah just another relaxing kind of chill day VR is coming back you rage quit a porn game well good that's not what that's not a big deal
[107:26.37]Let me move this off.
[107:28.71]Hey, you want some like radiance?
[107:36.88]That makeup ad has showed up.
[107:38.56]I've given that.
[107:39.30]You guys have already seen ads.
[107:41.29]Give ads.
[107:42.33]You've seen this one already like 30 or 40 times.
[107:47.29]So you've already had ads.
[107:56.55]But I'll see you guys later.
[107:57.55]See you guys in a couple days.
[107:59.85]On Tuesday to be specific.
[108:05.38]Thank you everybody for coming out.
[108:07.98]Back to the virtual world on Tuesday.
[108:17.93]Let us move this window here.
[108:23.21]And let's do the bits!
[108:26.69]from earlier, about six hours ago.
[108:31.89]What am I gonna do in VR?
[108:33.03]Mindshow, I'm gonna just start, we're just gonna do Mindshow.
[108:36.89]I'm just gonna start and do a full stream in Mindshow.
[108:41.30]I've been putting it off, because I know it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[108:44.54]So I wanna have a dedicated day to it.
[108:52.13]The only reason why I would not do it, then, is to do it on a weekend or something, but let's just go for it.
[109:00.27]But thank you, too, to start it off for Lazy Luke with the $7.777.77.
[109:06.42]Thank you.
[109:10.10]I've got footage of you this morning realizing that you can't gamble your life savings on stream.
[109:16.24]What is this?
[109:25.04]What the fuck?
[109:29.31]This is called another one of those videos.
[109:36.63]Thank you, Lazy Luke, for the 777.
[109:38.65]Appreciate it.
[109:44.57]Also, thank you to Clive Rip.
[109:47.77]Thank you for the $5.
[109:48.84]These bits are to give Etalyx a wet willy.
[109:54.51]Uh, thank you for the five dollars.
[109:57.93]How about I'll tell Etalyx a funny joke?
[110:02.78]Instead.
[110:04.98]Thank you for the five bucks.
[110:07.62]Hey, smelly boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[110:10.38]Hope you realize this is a borderline fetish game.
[110:13.22]And look, I played it for like an hour and a half, and I realized that I didn't want to play it anymore, so I stopped playing it.
[110:27.65]Thank you for the $2.50.
[110:31.51]Abev, thanks for the $10.
[110:33.57]Why are you naked if this isn't a porn game?
[110:40.91]I don't know.
[110:41.37]Thank you for the $10, Abev.
[110:47.70]Dorkcube, thanks for the $2.50.
[110:50.38]Holy cow.
[110:51.50]Cad is an absolute legend.
[110:54.62]Hope you make more games, dude.
[110:58.86]I do too.
[111:02.55]Something to discuss.
[111:04.61]Because that was fantastic.
[111:16.92]Cad's still here.
[111:19.02]No, that was a funny little Easter egg joke thing that he did.
[111:29.20]But thank you, DoorCube, and yes, again, thank you to CAD.
[111:32.32]It was insane.
[111:34.38]MagicalMarissa, another $10 on top of the $60 you've already given tonight.
[111:39.32]Thank you for $10 more here.
[111:41.56]They say, Otto.
[111:44.49]Otto.
[111:48.05]By the way, CAD did mention...
[111:52.56]that that game, he's gonna try to release it at the end of this stream.
[111:58.67]But it might have to wait till Monday because of the way Steam works.
[112:02.45]So if it's not up today for you just to download and play it however long you want,
[112:07.75]It will be available early next week, right?
[112:10.60]Is that correct?
[112:11.18]I want to make sure that's correct.
[112:13.48]Jerma Slots is the game we're talking about.
[112:15.68]Showcased it on stream earlier.
[112:17.88]When is the scratch off?
[112:20.50]I'll make it clear one more time because I know people are kind of trickling in and out.
[112:24.61]I cannot do the scratch ticket thing in Nevada because there's no state lottery in Nevada.
[112:30.57]I did not know that until this morning.
[112:32.99]So I cannot physically buy a scratch ticket.
[112:35.45]They do not exist in the state of Nevada, unfortunately.
[112:40.43]I did not even know that until this morning.
[112:43.59]So we will cross that bridge again.
[112:45.56]Have to drive to California.
[112:52.20]Road trip.
[112:53.68]Stream.
[112:58.84]But thank you to omgtayon for the 250.
[113:02.56]Jerma, this is your family.
[113:04.72]We're all worried about you and your gambling addiction you've developed.
[113:07.48]Please leave Las Vegas and come home.
[113:12.80]We hit it, though.
[113:14.30]We cheated, but we hit it.
[113:18.34]Zanziman, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[113:20.94]Jerma, I know it's not much, but here, you need it more than me.
[113:29.88]Thank you for the $10.
[113:32.94]Zany.
[113:33.60]I think it's not Zanziman.
[113:35.10]It's Zany Z-Man.
[113:36.66]Appreciate the $10.
[113:41.34]SuperSeal, thanks for $2.50.
[113:42.59]Please highlight this stream so that future generations can watch you play the best game ever.
[113:47.31]Whether I'm referring to Mr. Mosquito or Jerma Slots is up to you.
[113:54.63]It will be saved forever.
[113:57.77]FreudianWeapon, thanks for $5, Freudian.
[114:00.76]Hope you're having a good night.
[114:01.60]I thought I'd contribute to your gambling addiction.
[114:03.24]But seriously, this game looks amazing.
[114:04.68]It even makes me want to gamble.
[114:06.87]That's not... That was not my intention.
[114:12.81]If you're going to gamble, hopefully that you follow some very, very basic rules.
[114:18.93]Rule number one.
[114:20.05]Make sure it's legal where you live.
[114:22.21]Make sure you're old enough and it's legal.
[114:24.89]Rule number two.
[114:27.18]If you're gonna gamble, make sure you go into gambling...
[114:31.49]with going to a casino or whatever you're doing.
[114:34.59]Moderate yourself.
[114:36.31]Make sure you're doing it for fun, not to actually make money.
[114:39.87]Do not try to gamble to try to make money.
[114:48.38]He's promoting gambling.
[114:49.30]No, I'm trying to promote responsible gaming.
[114:57.78]Just go to a casino and bet $221 on roulette for black.
[115:08.71]That'd be bad.
[115:09.83]That's the worst thing you could probably do.
[115:12.49]But, yeah.
[115:13.31]Thank you, Frodeon, for the five dolls.
[115:17.59]Game responsibly.
[115:20.31]Tar Alacrin, thanks for the three bucks.
[115:22.62]Jerma, I've been subbed for 32 months.
[115:25.84]Only a few more months until I'm in the three-year club.
[115:28.64]You got any plans for a three-year sub badge so I can lord it over the filthy one- and two-year plebs?
[115:35.46]Yes.
[115:36.94]Yes.
[115:40.27]Three years?
[115:40.85]Holy shit, that's so long.
[115:45.75]Thank you, Tara Alecran, for the continued support.
[115:48.45]Forever.
[115:50.48]That's forever.
[115:51.24]That's as long as I've been streaming on Twitch.
[115:52.76]I've been streaming on Twitch for about three and a half years.
[115:56.44]Four years, almost.
[115:59.88]Uh, but yes.
[116:02.26]There will be three, six, twelve years, whatever is available.
[116:09.61]You know the word I was trying to say.
[116:13.91]Thank you something or other for the $2.50.
[116:15.29]How much will it take for you to release your hostages?
[116:17.15]I don't have any hostages.
[116:21.38]Thank you for the $2.50.
[116:24.50]Pika Banana, thanks for the $10.
[116:26.98]It's too bad the scratchers didn't work out, but this has been an amazing stream anyway.
[116:30.88]You never fail to crack me up.
[116:33.25]Love you, Jerma.
[116:33.71]jermaHeart.
[116:35.73]Thank you for the $10.00.
[116:40.00]And the incredibly kind message.
[116:43.14]I had a lot of fun tonight.
[116:46.07]It was just... It was like a shower, an absolute shower of smiles that were on my face.
[116:53.39]It was great.
[116:59.00]Thank you for the $10 and supporting the stream.
[117:03.00]Dorkube, thanks for the 250.
[117:04.54]After watching you play Risk of Rain 2, I decided to try it.
[117:07.54]Unfortunately, my laptop is garbage, so I had to turn down all the graphics settings.
[117:12.52]Did you know the game allows you to turn the textures to 130... 132nd of their full size?
[117:16.26]A 30... I can't even read that.
[117:18.16]132th.
[117:18.28]What does that mean?
[117:20.87]How do I say this?
[117:21.41]132th?
[117:21.57]How do you say this?
[117:33.72]Phonetically, just put it in the chat.
[117:36.96]1.30 second?
[117:39.18]But that doesn't sound right.
[117:45.91]1.30 second.
[117:46.49]I had it right the first time.
[117:55.61]It just sounds weird to say it.
[118:01.05]But thank you, Dorkube.
[118:02.69]Risk of Reigns 2 is a lot of fun.
[118:05.09]I'm glad you're able to at least play it.
[118:06.71]Well, there's a funny thing to rebuttal this with.
[118:11.30]There is no such thing as a basement in Las Vegas.
[118:35.22]The judge just tore up the prosecution and threw it in the air.
[118:42.14]There are no basements in Las Vegas.
[118:52.43]Oh, that's real convenient.
[118:59.55]No scratch tickets, no basement.
[119:01.75]This is starting to sound fake as hell.
[119:08.48]We've seen zero proof that you're in Las Vegas.
[119:12.82]Except for the balloon landing when I was surrounded by mountains and desert.
[119:22.69]It was faked.
[119:23.37]It was a green screen.
[119:28.10]I'll end up doing a weird Las Vegas stream, don't worry.
[119:31.08]There'll be some weird scenario where you're gonna see the whole strip or something.
[119:46.65]Maybe.
[119:48.95]But thank you Smellyboy for the $2.50.
[119:50.51]GeoGuessr is unironically my favorite game to watch you play.
[119:53.33]It's not a joke when we ask you to play.
[119:57.79]I know, and I have fun playing it, and I think it's a relaxing, interesting, fun game we can just kind of talk about whatever.
[120:04.59]But the reason why I didn't play it for a while is because it was sort of a crutch for a while, right?
[120:10.67]We would just play it all the time.
[120:13.15]There was like three or four cases in a row within a week, or two weeks, where it was like, uh, GeoGuessr!
[120:19.72]So I kind of wanted to take a break from it.
[120:21.14]I played it a lot.
[120:23.04]It was like, oh, we've been playing this game for like three, four hours.
[120:26.44]This game kind of sucks.
[120:28.48]Might as well play PictoPix, right?
[120:31.29]That's become what PictoPix is.
[120:33.91]It's because of Comcast.
[120:34.91]Yeah, that's true.
[120:35.49]But it was like a Comcast crutch.
[120:38.11]So I don't really need the Comcast crutch anymore.
[120:40.83]Although Cox is, as we've been aware, hasn't been nearly as bad as what Comcast used to do.
[120:48.26]But there still are problems sometimes with Cox.
[120:58.16]Switch it out with Google Feud once in a while.
[121:01.60]Yeah, I... I really do like just playing browser games and hanging out.
[121:08.90]I want to do this more often.
[121:09.78]We talked about it already.
[121:12.89]But I want to add more kind of hangout and doing browser stuff.
[121:21.85]There's a lot more opportunity, I think, to interact.
[121:26.05]and have conversations and come up with scenarios and talk to each other and stuff.
[121:34.91]So I want to do more of this type of thing, not less.
[121:42.49]But thank you, Smelly Boy.
[121:44.09]I do enjoy Neo... I just said Neo-Guessr.
[121:53.44]Neo-Guessr.
[121:56.64]Like for the Matrix.
[121:57.82]I don't know why.
[122:04.14]Weird.
[122:05.06]Neopets.
[122:09.87]Neo.
[122:19.57]Imagine a geoguessr map in the Matrix.
[122:21.35]I don't know.
[122:25.35]Stream the Matrix video game.
[122:26.45]It doesn't even work anymore.
[122:27.61]Isn't the Matrix Online completely off?
[122:30.77]Is the other one even worth playing?
[122:34.43]And then we had too many subs to even... There were so many community subs.
[122:43.66]Thank you, everybody that decided to give a community sub.
[122:46.36]Because there was a shitload of them.
[122:48.09]Like an hour ago.
[122:50.85]You guys are too kind.
[122:51.59]Thank you.
[122:53.97]Also, Smellyboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[122:55.61]Most of Russia in the east is Siberia.
[122:58.85]Nobody lives there.
[122:59.69]The vast majority of the population is always in the west of Russia.
[123:04.01]I'll remember that for next time.
[123:08.77]Flugboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[123:09.85]Hey, Jerma, hope you're doing well.
[123:11.61]Just got into a relationship with a very close friend of mine two years ago.
[123:17.75]and been happier than ever.
[123:19.39]But yeah, pretty fun stuff.
[123:20.63]Hope you and Kim are doing great, my guy.
[123:22.55]I always love her posts of you and her on Twitter.
[123:29.85]Yeah, first of all, I'm glad you're doing well in a relationship.
[123:37.19]Yeah, Kim and I are doing great.
[123:46.31]she's she's my girl you know she's my girl but thank you for the 250. glad you've uh glad you're happy and here are the ton of community subs so many of them
[124:14.16]$5 from Moson.
[124:17.04]I was in Boston for PAX, spent most of my time exploring Boston.
[124:20.36]An amazing city, but the Green Line can eat my ass.
[124:23.77]Yes, I agree.
[124:26.03]The Green Line is horrible.
[124:29.17]The Green Line is always packed.
[124:31.27]It's always hard to navigate.
[124:36.55]That is a true statement.
[124:39.57]I'm glad you had fun.
[124:41.23]Boston is a really, really nice city.
[124:44.20]Thank you, the $5.
[124:44.98]Hope you enjoyed PAX.
[124:46.92]Kind of sad that I wasn't able to be there.
[124:48.88]That would be the first time in its inception.
[124:52.78]I've been to every single PAX East since they started the first time.
[125:00.69]Didn't get to make it this year.
[125:04.51]But thank you, Fraudian Weapon, for the $5.
[125:05.69]$2.50 here twice in a row.
[125:12.16]You're as young as you feel, dress the way you like, age doesn't have a dress code.
[125:18.74]Yeah, I know, I was just kidding around.
[125:21.85]I was just kidding around.
[125:24.45]And then they also say, if you were to hang up the streaming hat tomorrow, I would respect your decision and wish you well on your future endeavors.
[125:31.07]Jeremiah Hart.
[125:32.43]Thank you.
[125:37.25]Yeah, it's never going to be a scenario where I just disappear.
[125:43.60]It would be something that you guys would know what's happening.
[125:46.38]I'd say, you know, that's it.
[125:49.12]I had a lot of fun.
[125:49.76]I want to move on to other things.
[125:52.30]But I don't think I would be able to stay away.
[125:55.25]I think I would probably still... Okay, let's say if I stop streaming completely, right?
[125:58.91]Whenever that will be.
[126:01.17]Or stop making streams or videos or content, online content, media, whatever you want to call it.
[126:09.64]I would still probably poke my head around.
[126:13.24]You know, once a week or once every few weeks or something.
[126:16.15]Turn a stream on and just hang out.
[126:17.89]Do something fun.
[126:19.67]I really don't think I would ever be gone forever completely from the platform.
[126:31.37]You know, I mean, it would just be... I don't think I'd be able to do that.
[126:46.07]But that's not in the cards in any sort of immediate sense.
[126:53.46]I have absolutely no plans to stop.
[126:57.97]But I do need to acknowledge the fact that if I ever don't want to do it anymore, and I don't, you know, not having fun anymore, I've done things that I want to do, I think I would probably want to eventually, you know, do something else.
[127:13.46]I don't know.
[127:14.62]I don't have a number for that.
[127:15.86]I don't have a time frame for that.
[127:19.28]But I think I need to be honest with everybody.
[127:23.09]Sure, it's easy to be like... Streams forever!
[127:26.17]This is... It's... I drill up 80!
[127:29.62]But I don't... That's... I don't know if that's gonna happen.
[127:41.37]I'm currently... Enjoying it.
[127:45.19]Something I love to do.
[127:47.85]I love being...
[127:49.98]On stream.
[127:50.72]I love being part of the community.
[127:52.48]I love seeing all this shit.
[127:53.58]I love doing all these things.
[127:55.60]So I don't have a... It's not gonna stop anytime soon.
[127:59.54]There you go.
[128:03.21]Quarter dime, thanks for the five dollars.
[128:05.91]Just disappear for five years and then come back.
[128:08.75]Uh... With... A turban or... And telling us how you found faith.
[128:17.11]Well, like just go on like a religious journey and come back?
[128:24.49]No.
[128:26.07]I don't think I would do that.
[128:34.78]Disappear for five years and come back as like a preacher or something?
[128:41.52]Would you be interested in becoming the next Joker if DC contacted you?
[128:44.98]No.
[128:46.93]nope now the riddler you got an opportunity somebody already said it I didn't even need to do it how much would you do it for 40 bucks
[129:14.57]But I want 5% of all royalties from the movie.
[129:24.34]No, I want 0.2% of all revenue the movie makes.
[129:27.80]I'll do it for $40.
[129:34.68]It's gonna flop.
[129:36.78]No, it's gonna have at least like a 74% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[129:42.43]I'll make sure of that.
[129:44.66]Yeah, well, the movie really sucked.
[129:46.84]Terrible writing, awful, awful direction.
[129:49.22]The cinematography, the story was all over the place, but you just couldn't take your eyes off Jeremy Elbertson's performance.
[130:00.29]And then, like, you know, on Rotten Tomatoes, you have the thing where the guy, the person would write the thing.
[130:03.95]Even the skill of Jeremy Elbertson cannot hold this mess together.
[130:07.84]I don't care if it gets a 30% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[130:11.46]I'll carry it.
[130:20.00]The Great Lord Walden, $50 right now.
[130:22.58]5,000 bits.
[130:25.48]From the Great Lord Walden.

[130:55.19]You don't feel old.
[130:57.79]We're young.
[130:58.33]33 is the new 20.
[131:00.76]40 is the new 30.
[131:01.54]I know it is.
[131:02.32]I'm telling you it is.
[131:15.31]50 will always be 50.
[131:17.69]50 is not the new 50 or the old.
[131:19.57]50 is just 50 and then from that point forward, 50 is just the 50.
[131:23.27]You're gone.
[131:24.39]You're out.
[131:25.61]55, you can retire.
[131:26.81]40 is the new 30.
[131:29.69]50 is still 50.
[131:30.87]I'm not going to feel old until I'm 49 and one day till my birthday.
[131:49.47]You're allowed to feel old when you're 50.
[132:01.69]Jerma can run for president in two months.
[132:04.31]No, I can't.
[132:06.13]It's 35.
[132:09.64]I cannot run for president yet.
[132:10.78]It's going to have to be Jerma 2021.
[132:18.63]What do you mean, yeah, I can?
[132:20.19]It's 34?
[132:23.79]It would have to be Jerma 2024.
[132:31.32]He's thought about it.
[132:32.86]No, it's just something that you are told in middle school.
[132:43.06]Uh... I want to ask if you're interested in any game recommendations.
[132:48.22]If you have recommendations, throw them in the recommendation channel on the Discord.
[132:51.72]I check it all the time.
[132:55.03]Everyone's thought about it.
[132:56.19]Yeah, everybody's thought about it.
[132:59.33]Five more community subs on top of everything.
[133:06.95]Thank you so much for the five community subs.
[133:10.64]That was from Black Dimer.
[133:13.72]Thank you, Black Dimer.
[133:24.37]What's the Discord?
[133:25.43]Here it is.
[133:33.53]It is a public Discord.
[133:34.49]There is a sub-channel, but it's open to the public.
[133:39.01]It's a great community there.
[133:43.76]But thank you, Great Lord Walden, for the $50, and happy birthday again.
[133:50.35]Also, a little bit further back here, we had... A quarterdime, thanks for the five bucks.
[133:56.21]Uh, I think... Didn't get you before.
[134:03.23]We read your message, but I don't think I even said your name.
[134:06.04]But that was quarterdime.
[134:08.34]For five dollars.
[134:08.96]Thank you.
[134:10.68]Juno Upsetto, thanks for the $2.50.
[134:12.22]The leaf in front of the camera is actually GeoGuessr hard mode.
[134:17.32]It did make it pretty hard.
[134:23.23]Great Lord Walden's got 82 gifted subs.
[134:25.81]Some of you guys... You wonder how my sub count is so high.
[134:31.76]There are at least a few dozen of you guys that have 50 to 100 each gifted subs.
[134:41.19]That's... It's just bonkers.
[134:57.14]A simple way I can share the love.
[134:58.58]Well, I really appreciate that.
[135:03.00]Thank you.
[135:05.10]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $2.50.
[135:07.41]No message, just $2.50.
[135:08.77]Thank you, CluelessSniper.
[135:11.75]Novi333, thanks for the $3.33.
[135:12.63]No message, just $3.33.
[135:13.17]Novi coming in.
[135:21.04]Freudian, thanks for the 250.
[135:22.34]Pretty sure I spammed bit messages tonight.
[135:25.02]Whoops, a bad habit of mine, I suppose.
[135:26.78]Anyhow, happy Saturday.
[135:29.44]No, you've got like three or four here.
[135:33.19]Spam?
[135:33.53]What are you talking about?
[135:38.75]Thank you for the 250.
[135:42.17]Have a happy Saturday.
[135:47.71]Uh, and then, we also had... Jermba lied about Minecraft VR, with five more community subs, bringing them to 220 gifted subs.
[136:00.89]Yes, I guess that you heard that correct.
[136:04.03]220 gifted subs.
[136:13.01]That's... so many.
[136:16.45]Thank you, GermoLightAboutMinecraftVR, for your monster sub gifting.
[136:33.10]Thank you.
[136:34.82]Uh, Crimbalt, thanks for the 250.
[136:36.35]Hello, sire.
[136:37.09]I was just wondering if you saw the trailer for the sequel to Hollow Knight.
[136:40.31]I don't know if you ever got to finish the first one.
[136:42.35]Would be interested in this one, but regardless, I love all your streams.
[136:45.83]Uh, I have seen the second game.
[136:53.98]I will probably play it.
[136:56.84]There's a Hollow Knight sequel.
[136:59.00]Yes, there is a Hollow Knight sequel.
[137:06.65]Let's run the credits.
[137:07.57]That's it for the bits for the most part.
[137:13.48]Thank you, everybody.
[137:16.62]Here come the names.
[137:18.36]Thanks for supporting the stream.
[137:23.12]All of you.
[137:28.79]Read them.
[137:29.17]Go, go, go.
[137:31.89]Ding.
[137:33.75]Two State Taco.
[137:37.46]Poopy ass.
[137:42.34]I used to read these.
[137:43.52]Remember when I used to really give it a really solid attempt?
[137:53.61]And it was so much slower.
[137:56.73]Sometimes it would be like this.
[138:00.49]But it's like this almost every time now.
[138:02.49]You guys understand how fucking ridiculous that is?
[138:17.21]Jerma lied about gwae?
[138:20.11]Jerma lied about like, gwae?
[138:21.83]Like the song thing?
[138:22.99]What is with all these Jerma lied about this, Jerma lied about that?
[138:26.91]Jerma lied about gwae?
[138:34.42]What the fuck?
[138:36.74]Uh...
[138:39.37]Somebody asked, a quarterdime asked, Hey Jerma, if I were to go watch an old stream of yours, any old stream, which would you choose and why?
[138:49.05]Um... Probably Sorcery.
[138:57.14]Sorcery is the first real stream attempt that I really did on a schedule, or doing Twitch instead of YouTube.
[139:08.96]I would probably say that those... A lot of stream jokes and a lot of classic references.
[139:16.25]Even to stuff that's still in the chat now.
[139:19.21]Stuff like sus.
[139:21.93]Um... The green screen stream was so much fun.
[139:25.33]There's been so many.
[139:26.13]There's been too many.
[139:27.65]All of them.
[139:29.90]Except for Skate 3.
[139:31.00]Don't watch that one.
[139:31.84]Don't watch the Karazhan stream.
[139:33.76]Don't watch the Mario Tennis stream.
[139:35.82]Don't watch, um...
[139:40.73]Let's pull a few others.
[139:46.31]Don't watch the Nioh stream.
[139:49.57]Rick and Morty?
[139:51.17]That was fine.
[139:53.03]The handheld ga- No, watch the handheld game stream.
[139:55.35]That's one of my favorites.
[140:00.54]Rick and Morty was awful.
[140:02.96]Yeah, but was that my fault, or was that the game's fault?
[140:06.30]Maybe it was a little bit, but I was really tired.
[140:10.42]I was so tired when we got to Rick and Morty.
[140:14.74]Both.
[140:15.24]I mean, it wasn't my- I was so tired, I just couldn't even do anything.
[140:19.27]And I gave up even 10% of the way through, I just couldn't do it.
[140:24.20]It was Chat's fault.
[140:29.91]But that wasn't, okay, it was Minecraft, VR, and then Rick and Morty.
[140:33.85]So that stream was good.
[140:36.43]I liked that.
[140:37.11]It was a lot of fun.
[140:38.43]But the Rick and Morty portion of that stream, that's not the whole, I'm talking about a whole stream.
[140:43.68]The Skate 3 stream was a whole stream.
[140:52.34]But I'll see you guys in a few days.
[140:53.79]I'm probably thinking about Tuesday.
[140:59.25]I'll let you know.
[140:59.79]The business will be changed and updated here.
[141:03.97]Look for me on Tuesday.
[141:07.97]I'll see you guys real soon.
[141:09.25]We'll do some more VR.
[141:10.35]Mind show.
[141:11.75]Mind show coming up.
[141:13.89]Gonna make some skits.
[141:16.73]Much love to you all.

[141:47.63]Oh, my God!
[141:49.96]Just get... No, man!
[141:56.20]Give me a break!

[142:01.45]I will defend that to the death of how bullshit that was.
[142:04.61]Alright, let's get some loot here.
[142:15.46]If you don't know what I mean, we've got... We've got, we've got, we've got stream legends down at the bottom of the page there.
[142:25.72]What is Rap God?
[142:30.11]How the fuck did I do this?
[142:56.33]I couldn't even do it back then.
[142:58.19]Alright, here you go.
[143:00.58]You ready?
[143:00.98]Open up your loot boxes for free.
