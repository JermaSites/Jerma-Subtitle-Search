[00:13.22]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15.74]It's Grandpa here.
[00:17.40]And I've got a special episode of the MLG Crow Grandpa for you today.
[00:22.25]We're gonna take a trip down memory lane.
[00:25.87]We're gonna cover all the Call of Duties.
[00:28.65]We're gonna reminisce on all the wonderful things that Infinity Ward and Activision gave us over the last 50 years.
[00:36.60]So, let's start with Black Ops.
[00:39.28]We already know about Modern Warfare 3, so let's travel back to an easier time, a more quaint place, and that was Black Ops.
[00:49.49]Black Ops released in 1999, and was a wonderful game.
[00:55.31]They introduced a lot of different shit, and I thought it was great.
[00:59.83]And then you travel even further back.
[01:02.33]Let's continue to go back to Call of Duty Modern Warfare 4.
[01:08.12]Some would say this is the golden age of the Call of Duties, and this is the best one I was ever made.
[01:13.96]And, you know, I totally agree with them.
[01:16.56]There was all kinds of good graphics, and it was the first time they ever introduced killstreaks like this into a game.
[01:24.64]And it makes me wanna diarrhea, because I kinda have to.
[01:29.04]And it reminiscing, it makes you feel good.
[01:32.16]So let's continue to go back.
[01:34.40]Let's go back even further to Call of Duty, Call of Duty 3.
[01:40.31]This was the old generation.
[01:42.25]This was on the PlayStation 1.
[01:45.01]It came out in 1982, I think.
[01:47.77]If you never got to play any of these old Call of Duties, then you really need to.
[01:52.58]Because these really are the foundations of all the fucking video games we know today.
[01:57.48]I mean, we're talking about Super Mario Brothers was influenced by Call of Duty 3.
[02:03.09]Dave Mirrors Freestyle BMX was influenced by Call of Duty 2.
[02:07.62]And speaking of history, let's keep going back.
[02:10.74]Let's go back to Call of Duty 1.
[02:13.46]Which is just, this is the god of Call of Duties.
[02:16.73]Because this created everything.
[02:18.47]Without this, this Call of Duty is just like fucking me.
[02:21.91]If I didn't exist, then you wouldn't fucking exist.
[02:24.76]So you need to respect your elders and play Call of Duty 1.
[02:28.14]Because that's the grandfather of them all.
[02:31.39]So now let's keep going back even further to when the dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
[02:38.28]I remember the Tyrannosaurus rex like it was generally yesterday.
[02:42.00]And he bit people, he was mean to people.
[02:45.26]Now let's go back even further to when water was invented.
[02:50.18]I invented water.
[02:51.83]It was me.
[02:52.57]I did it.
[02:53.15]And fire.
[02:54.11]And lightning.
[02:55.15]And storms.
[02:56.19]It was all me.
[02:56.91]I did it.
[02:57.81]And let's go back even further.
[02:59.09]You know what?
[02:59.51]Screw this.
[03:00.25]Let's go back to when atoms were invented.
[03:02.87]I created those, too.
[03:04.38]Actually, no.
[03:04.78]I didn't totally create those.
[03:06.78]Me and my friend Jay Ogle, we made those together in a science laboratory in the 1920s.
[03:12.90]But I did it mostly.
[03:14.22]He's a fucking asshole.
[03:15.34]Don't listen to a word he says.
[03:17.16]And let's keep going.
[03:17.97]You know what?
[03:18.39]Why stop there?
[03:19.31]Let's keep going back... Where the hell am I?
[03:24.39]What the hell is this?
[03:25.41]Wait, what the hell is going on?
[03:27.09]Who the fuck are you?
[03:28.17]Who the fuck are you?
[03:29.55]I'm Grandpa.
[03:30.37]Who wants to know?
[03:31.59]How did this guy even get in?
[03:32.89]I don't understand how you got in here.
[03:34.43]You aren't even created yet.
[03:35.89]I am God.
[03:40.27]I was just talking about Call of Duty and I wanted to keep going back in time.
[03:43.88]Silence.
[03:45.40]That is enough of this.
[03:47.58]I don't want any more nonsense from you, Grandpa Hilldugle.
[03:53.11]Alright, I'm sorry.
[03:53.83]Okay, okay.
[03:54.41]I'll go back to my own time.
[03:55.91]I'll go back.
[03:56.89]But there's one thing I need to know.
[03:58.35]I just... This is really important.
[04:00.31]When you created assholes, did you... Were you laughing the whole time?
[04:04.42]Okay, yep.
[04:04.98]Hold on.
[04:05.30]Hold on.
