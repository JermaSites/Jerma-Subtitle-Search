[00:00.82]I am the rocket man they talk about I jump from star to star I'll walk it out hey what's going on guys my name is shibby and today we have a magical wizard wars preview so enjoy the gameplay I'm very excited for this upcoming title from paradox studios if you want to sign up for the alpha the link is in the video description so it's right down there anyways guys enjoy the video and I'll just uh... see you guys during that
[00:26.97]Turning to the gameplay, this is how each match starts.
[00:29.71]Remember, this is alpha or probably pre-alpha footage.
[00:33.77]The rock wall falls, and then you and your team go to the cap points.
[00:37.89]There are three cap points on the map.
[00:39.61]The mini map is bottom left.
[00:41.98]The three cap points are located top left, top right, and bottom middle.
[00:46.10]A couple of my League of Legends friends
[00:48.66]who saw some gameplay, or actually were there, said, hey Shibby, this kind of reminds me of a Dominion-style map.
[00:55.92]And being an FPS player and a mobile player, it reminds me of playing Domination, where you cap the points and you help drive the other enemy team tickets down.
[01:07.11]You will see the tickets are right above the mini-map on the left bottom side, and once they are to zero, the enemy team does not lose right away.
[01:15.91]they need to be completely wiped off the map.
[01:17.99]So it can be zero, and their four guys can still be running around.
[01:21.15]You need to take them to zero tickets and kill them all because there is a revive feature.
[01:26.09]As you will see, bottom middle, there is sort of like a skill bar.
[01:29.93]I believe they called this your super bar or super meter.
[01:33.64]Anyways, it doesn't really matter what it's called.
[01:35.76]As you gather points for either capping objectives, defending, killing enemies, you will get your skill points, or basically your bar, will progress.
[01:44.72]So the one option is your haste, the two option is revive, the three option is the Grim Reaper, and the four option is a meteor strike.
[01:52.60]Say you're on the Grim Reaper, so that'd be the three option, you use it, your whole bar goes away.
[01:56.90]It doesn't go down like just one.
[01:58.78]That's one thing that is very important.
[02:00.89]For those of you who have never played Magicka before, I bet you you are very confused about what you're watching, so let's try to go over it very quickly.
[02:07.99]As you will see, once again, bottom middle, next to my super bar or skill bar, there are eight elements.
[02:13.92]That would be on my Q button, W, etc.
[02:17.04]So, obviously we're playing on PC.
[02:19.19]Hopefully that's pretty clear.
[02:21.07]Anyways, you can queue up three spells and there's around 100 plus spell combinations at the moment.
[02:27.23]Right now you cannot do your spells on your weapons like you could in the first game, that just wouldn't make sense, but once again it's alpha, things can change.
[02:34.88]I believe I am showing you guys some death features, so just kind of where you respawn, and also what happens when you revive.
[02:40.78]So I just called in a meteor strike, the meteors come down and just kind of blow everyone up.
[02:45.85]But, one thing you guys need to remember is there is friendly fire, so you can do some serious trolling, and that goes without saying that you can just kill yourself straight out.
[02:54.25]That does work too.
[02:55.95]Alright, so we're going to be respawning here and then jumping towards the later half of the game.
[03:00.45]Let's talk about the shielding for the second.
[03:02.45]That kind of makes it like the fighting style of like counter, counter, counter.
[03:06.26]As you can see, on the ground I casted a half arcane and half fire shield.
[03:11.56]That means I'm going to get a 50% fire reduction from all fire spells and 50% damage reduction from all arcane or death spells.
[03:20.87]So that's pretty nice.
[03:22.01]It's kind of my default spell shield.
[03:24.01]I kind of like that because being lit on fire is never fun.
[03:27.75]We can also self-heal.
[03:29.16]That's something you do.
[03:29.88]You just do the middle mouse button and that would be a self-cast.
[03:33.30]As we're capping this point, the dragon or the snake or whatever that is in the ground spawns and there's two minions that just sit there and kind of defend.
[03:41.45]So that's kind of what's going on there.
[03:43.25]As you see, the tickets for the enemy team is dropping really low.
[03:46.84]I'm gonna go for the last cap point because you need a point to respawn.
[03:50.70]And here's the last enemy.
[03:52.30]I then take him out there, and pretty much I'm gonna cap out this point, and I believe there are still two enemies left on the mini-map.
[03:58.91]As you can see, bottom left, or there's still three.
[04:01.81]So I'm gonna be dropping mines here, trying to take him out, and close out the game.
[04:05.81]Now, if you guys are thinking in a traditional MOBA sense, there is no leveling during the game.
[04:10.03]You just have all the spells available to you, and you just kind of do that.
[04:13.00]However, I do believe there will be profile leveling and all that kind of good stuff.
[04:17.20]We end up winning here.
[04:18.00]I go seven and three, top scoring on my team like a boss.
[04:21.66]And yeah, that's some gameplay, guys.
[04:23.04]It's going to be free to play.
[04:24.03]Once again, sign up.
[04:24.91]Link for the alpha in the description.
