[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.04]Yeah, I'm here.
[00:03.94]I'm here.
[00:05.48]What's up?
[00:08.53]This dude hates sorcery?
[00:11.89]I don't hate sorcery.
[00:17.97]I don't hate sorcery.
[00:18.63]Where'd you get that idea?
[00:19.68]I mean, you thought there was going to be sorcery today, but you were wrong and so was I. And there's a reason for it.
[00:30.50]Reason number one.
[00:32.59]Be very clear.
[00:38.49]I didn't want to play it for like an hour and 40 minutes.
[00:41.88]Reason number two.
[00:43.20]Free stream chat decided.
[00:44.88]They decided.
[00:50.12]Not to do it today.
[00:52.67]It's like 150 people, guys.
[00:57.19]Free stream chat wanted their own sorcery stream.
[01:01.12]Its own stream, not just like a couple hours.
[01:07.32]And the new Hitman map came out.
[01:08.56]And what is this thing popping up on the top of my... What is this?
[01:13.04]What's this new thing they added?
[01:14.28]I keep seeing the different subs pop in and out.
[01:16.96]I don't like this.
[01:20.12]How do I get rid of this?
[01:22.87]How do I get rid of this activity feed?
[01:24.45]I don't want this activity feed.
[01:28.47]Okay.
[01:30.35]Anyways, yeah, sorcery will be its own thing.
[01:32.69]We're also going to play multiverses today in a sponsor segment.
[01:40.64]I fucking love that game, by the way.
[01:44.14]While I was kind of sick, I've been playing it on my Xbox.
[01:58.14]I'm just sitting there sick playing it on Xbox.
[02:02.04]Xbox Andy.
[02:02.84]Yeah, guess what?
[02:03.78]Series S. What's wrong with it?
[02:06.83]It's everything you want in a console.
[02:08.53]I actually believe that.
[02:18.37]The Xbox is a stinker.
[02:20.01]No, it is not.
[02:20.79]The Xbox Series S is actually really good.
[02:24.26]You get the Game Pass on there.
[02:26.56]You can put it on YouTube and Twitch.
[02:29.06]It's like a media box for me.
[02:30.46]It's not a console.
[02:34.30]That's literally your worst take.
[02:36.10]I just made that up.
[02:36.96]I made that person up.
[02:38.16]No one said that.
[02:39.02]I combined three messages.
[02:42.44]Somebody said, that is your worst.
[02:44.49]And then somebody said, I'm getting takeout tonight.
[02:47.40]And I just combined them to make my narrative make sense.
[02:54.85]Anyways, Hitman has a new map.
[02:56.83]I played all the Hitmans, obviously.
[02:59.27]So, we're going to do this.
[03:01.11]I'm feeling better.
[03:01.79]A lot better than I was a week ago.
[03:04.67]So, I think I'm alright now.
[03:07.08]For those of you that were curious, COVID kind of came through the house a week and a half ago or so.
[03:14.70]And then I got put into a colitis flare-up.
[03:17.54]Probably because of it.
[03:20.37]I'm negative for COVID, but I have this colitis problem.
[03:24.33]So, but that's getting worse.
[03:25.37]That's fine.
[03:26.24]That's not out of the ordinary.
[03:27.92]I know how to deal with that, but we're good to go.
[03:32.74]Anyways, let me tweet.
[03:35.44]Give me one second.
[03:36.34]I got to make sure I get this right.
[03:37.56]One sec.
[05:18.05]Okay, I'm back.
[05:18.49]Alright, so let's do the Hitman map.
[05:20.39]I haven't played Hitman since Hitman 3 VR, which I wasn't a big fan of.
[05:25.15]I, in fact, was very, very adamantly opposed to it.
[05:29.34]Must be a long-ass tweet.
[05:31.14]No, it wasn't.
[05:31.88]I just, I had to go grab, I had to get something.
[05:33.88]Alright, you guys ready for Hitman?
[05:41.21]You guys good for Hitman?
[05:45.11]Okay!
[05:48.29]Is the new map any good?
[05:50.68]How does it compare to the rest of the series?
[05:52.74]Am I going to like it?
[05:53.34]Am I going to hate it?
[05:53.90]How is it?
[05:55.72]Be honest.
[05:57.46]Don't sugarcoat this.
[06:01.65]Is it all right?
[06:02.37]No idea.
[06:02.99]I mean, it literally came out like two or three days ago, so maybe you don't know.
[06:06.47]All right, let's go.
[06:12.04]What's my title?
[06:12.70]Oh, it's alright.
[06:13.04]That title's fine.
[06:14.90]It's another concrete level.
[06:16.11]It fucking better not be.
[06:18.27]I actually mean that.
[06:19.17]It better not be.
[06:24.01]Um... Is it actually?
[06:31.36]Better not be.
[06:35.64]That's fucking loud.
[06:36.50]Alright, are you guys ready?
[06:42.08]Destinations.
[06:43.42]It's this Ambrose Island.
[06:45.70]It's this new one.
[06:50.02]Are you guys ready for this?
[06:53.67]Should I turn it up?
[06:54.17]Should I turn it down?
[06:55.27]Handsome.
[07:07.69]Go away, Red Andy.
[07:09.49]My skin is tinted a little orange.
[07:11.81]So what?
[07:15.27]Fuck off.
[07:16.93]I have like red.
[07:18.56]I have red, rosy, red cheeks.
[07:20.74]Fuck you.
[07:21.20]All right, you got a problem?
[07:24.02]Then speak it into the speaker.
[07:40.48]Aren't all these people dead?
[07:43.72]I actually don't know.
[07:44.66]Spoilers.
[07:45.10]It's Hitman 3.
[07:46.34]It's your fault for being here.
[08:08.76]Literally Hitman 3.
[08:20.23]Re-inventing themselves as a glorified gang of international thieves.
[08:25.87]They specialize in ruthless spectacle heists.
[08:29.75]Zero regard to collateral damage.
[08:32.06]I've seen the man's file.
[08:34.24]What did you expect would happen?
[08:36.12]It's not like I had much choice, seeing as all my best lieutenants were killed by you two.
[08:44.95]Crest is a rabid dog.
[08:47.67]He is my responsibility, my stake.
[08:52.23]I would like your help correcting it.
[08:53.97]Shut up.
[08:55.47]You don't care about me.
[08:57.41]An isolated harbor north from the Strait of Malacca.
[09:00.96]Coincidentally, one of Wazir Kale's old ports of call.
[09:06.35]according to my intel crest and his men have joined forces with a local pirate syndicate to raid a passing tanker okay his goal control unit for an ether corpse being covertly shipped abroad the satellite is a node in the company's most secure cloud storage network so they would pay a fortune to preserve its integrity
[09:28.02]What is Crest's endgame?
[09:30.36]Extortion, if I had to guess.
[09:32.64]We don't have the luxury of a full investigation.
[09:35.90]For us to move against the Constant, we need Providence to think the threat is over and lower their guard.
[09:42.92]Another militia attack on Ether would raise alarms.
[09:47.15]I agree.
[09:49.21]47, you'll need to eliminate Crest and destroy that control unit, or lock the militia out.
[09:55.25]The satellite cannot fall into their hands.
[10:00.22]I only need one grenade.
[10:02.50]And I'll be able to do it easily.
[10:03.73]Are you eating toothpaste?
[10:04.41]What are you talking about?
[10:05.85]Sounds like a plan.
[10:28.99]Forza 7 out.
[10:39.23]You hate it.
[10:40.35]Fucking relax.
[10:42.25]I haven't streamed like a week.
[10:43.28]Sorry, guys.
[10:43.64]I have a lot of energy right now.
[10:45.40]Hold on.
[10:45.70]I'm going to turn this back on.
[10:49.62]And ask me what happened.
[10:51.76]Hey, there I am.
[10:55.27]Alright, so we need to... We need to... We gotta kill.
[11:00.22]Kill.
[11:00.90]Kill.
[11:01.20]I haven't played Hitman in a while either.
[11:07.52]What's with the toothpaste stuff?
[11:08.96]Why are you asking about toothpaste?
[11:16.23]Can somebody fill me in on what the toothpaste thing is here?
[11:18.73]This toothpaste joke?
[11:19.55]I don't get it.
[11:21.66]Alright, let's go.
[11:23.02]I'm going to do default Andy, that's fine.
[11:25.70]Neutralize the satellite control unit.
[11:28.90]Easy enough.
[11:31.86]You know, I keep avoiding on... I feel like this is a YouTube embedded video.
[11:39.41]Is it?
[11:41.61]It is.
[11:41.85]Okay.
[11:42.73]I thought that was... What the...
[11:48.32]How do I go?
[11:48.90]Okay, play.
[11:50.12]Alright, let's go.
[11:50.74]Let's go.
[11:54.44]It's been a while since I've turned a computer on.
[11:56.64]I'm not fucking around.
[11:58.02]I've not turned this computer on.
[11:59.21]I have not turned on the computer in five days.
[12:02.27]I think that's accurate.
[12:03.11]Alright, professional's fine.
[12:08.29]Master?
[12:10.69]Why is it on master?
[12:11.94]Who did that?
[12:15.28]I didn't do that.
[12:18.02]Is it weird that I actually... No.
[12:20.06]We're not doing fucking Master.
[12:21.25]No way.
[12:21.53]Let's go.
[12:27.89]When did I put Master on?
[12:31.88]Try Master for one life?
[12:32.84]No.
[12:34.96]I don't think so.
[12:35.38]Welcome to the Andaman Sea, 47.
[12:38.18]We've arrived just in time.
[12:40.29]It seems Crest didn't disclose the true object of the heist to his partners.
[12:44.90]So Arca has seized one of the satellite control unit's key cards as collateral until they can renegotiate.
[12:52.76]The militia have set up camp near the remains of a colonial outpost.
[12:56.55]Both Crest and the control unit should be nearby.
[12:59.71]You'll need to destroy the unit itself
[13:01.93]Or render it inoperable by retrieving both keycards.
[13:05.15]Give me a grenade.
[13:05.69]Knowing Crest, he'll have given his to someone he trusts.
[13:08.91]But Akka is less inclined to delegate.
[13:11.81]She should be in the pirate base when she's not out among the locals.
[13:15.19]Okay.
[13:17.22]I provided you with a GPS tracker.
[13:19.52]Activate it when you're done and I'll initiate extraction.
[13:22.56]The sooner we finish up here, the better.
[13:25.18]Alright.
[13:27.22]Sounds easy enough.
[13:29.94]I thought I was in like a superhero costume.
[13:31.64]I was like, holy shit, I have like a superhero costume on.
[13:36.75]Okay.
[13:36.95]Are we doing we effing?
[13:40.49]It's gonna happen.
[13:41.39]Unfortunately, I have to deal with it for now.
[13:44.35]Okay, eliminate.
[13:45.53]Eliminate.
[13:45.93]Deny access to the surveillance satellite.
[13:47.75]Destroy the satellite.
[13:48.53]Who's this guy?
[13:53.92]Alright, let's get over here.
[13:57.82]Like an island.
[14:02.84]Ever since they got back from the raid, the mood's been different.
[14:06.01]They're not being as chummy with the toy soldiers anymore.
[14:09.25]Am I allowed in here?
[14:09.81]I'm not trespassing.
[14:10.79]What?
[14:10.99]I'm just going in their freezer.
[14:12.51]This is just weird.
[14:28.40]Okay.
[14:28.58]Is there anything I can do in here?
[14:30.46]Wait.
[14:30.88]Fish.
[14:34.45]Got it.
[14:36.83]Can I take... Wait, what's this?
[14:39.85]Uh, fishing line.
[14:41.23]Okay.
[14:44.39]Might be useful later.
[14:45.21]Alright, we're good.
[14:50.91]Alright, let's go.
[14:53.09]I'm not gonna...
[14:56.11]These are the targets.
[14:57.93]No, what?
[14:58.57]No, they're not.
[15:00.59]Not even close.
[15:09.24]Destroy satellite control unit.
[15:12.44]Do I have to do that?
[15:13.32]Or can I just throw a brick through a window and hit the person in the head?
[15:18.50]Stop saying teeth.
[15:19.18]I don't know what that means.
[15:19.90]I'm going to go this way.
[15:25.47]What do I have for weapons?
[15:27.71]How do I open up my menu?
[15:28.87]Is it tab?
[15:30.33]Holds a button?
[15:31.19]What's the menu?
[15:32.49]I?
[15:32.91]Yeah, okay.
[15:35.27]GPS tracker.
[15:37.47]Coin.
[15:38.33]Gun?
[15:39.57]Alright, let's go.
[15:43.53]I forgot how pretty this game was.
[15:44.61]Okay.
[15:53.86]Okay.
[15:55.53]Right over here.
[15:56.11]That's the first target.
[15:59.69]Should I change disguise?
[16:00.65]I'm just kind of a guy in a scuba outfit.
[16:02.31]Is that weird?
[16:03.21]Is it weird for me to look like this?
[16:06.37]Is this weird?
[16:08.36]You too.
[16:08.66]No, this is not weird.
[16:10.62]Why do I hear music?
[16:24.81]Holy shit, this guy's got a whole studio in here.
[16:27.44]I gotta get in there.
[16:27.94]Is this a streamer?
[16:38.52]How do I get in here?
[16:52.13]Why can I not go in?
[16:53.07]I can't climb in this.
[16:56.90]I have a lockpick, though, don't I?
[16:57.92]Put the gun away, please.
[17:02.67]Don't I have a lockpick?
[17:03.27]Yeah, I do.
[17:04.33]I don't have a lockpick?
[17:05.17]How?
[17:06.10]Alright, I need to find the key.
[17:06.98]I need to get in that streamer room.
[17:25.98]Pretty much how I do fishing as well.
[17:29.19]How many of you guys go fishing and just cast into the water and just reel it back and you're not even trying?
[17:33.99]You're just humoring the one friend that actually wants to be there.
[17:40.61]Okay, I don't know how to get in there, but... Is there intel over there?
[17:44.64]No.
[17:45.36]I know.
[17:52.11]Okay.
[17:52.63]Alright, this person's right over here.
[17:54.44]Wait, what's that?
[18:23.56]I'm making sure I have a lot of stuff.
[18:28.80]What is this?
[18:30.86]What?
[18:32.22]Was it arm wrestling?
[18:50.25]I've seen these videos before.
[18:53.06]Let's go.
[18:53.52]You want to fucking go?
[18:54.28]Hold on.
[18:55.60]I can't save right now?
[18:56.34]Next round.
[18:57.94]Let's see.
[18:58.40]What happened?
[18:59.04]I'm ready.
[18:59.30]Ready up.
[18:59.70]Wind up.
[18:59.90]I don't get it.
[19:20.47]Do I have to tap?
[19:23.42]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[19:24.34]Okay.
[19:25.08]What?
[19:33.24]He hurt his hand on my face?
[19:40.01]Why am I made out of cement?
[19:42.91]Alright, I'm going to get this guy right here.
[19:50.16]See you later.
[19:51.56]I killed that guy.
[19:54.32]I legitimately, I think I just killed him.
[19:55.66]Come on.
[19:55.85]Get off here.
[19:56.31]Do I have to go through all of them?
[20:18.22]Okay.
[20:20.31]Should I just drop him?
[20:33.08]Shut up!
[20:35.94]Why don't you get up here and show me?
[20:41.33]Wait, this is the guy.
[20:42.11]I hope I can do it to him.
[20:44.05]So now what?
[20:45.47]I get to be friends with this guy?
[21:13.86]Can I save the game?
[21:14.96]I would save the game.
[21:15.98]I can't save it.
[21:20.79]I have to just do this until I can stop.
[21:22.55]Okay.
[21:32.70]Okay, is it gonna, like, cut to the next scene where every single person in the town has a red hand on their face?
[21:40.12]And I'm, like, counting hundreds?
[21:41.62]I don't understand.
[21:43.44]How many more times do I have to do this?
[21:46.53]What the fuck?
[21:47.61]He dug himself into a hole, you stupid bastard.
[22:02.76]Why didn't they shoot me?
[22:04.34]Why didn't they do anything?
[22:06.36]I'm so confused.
[22:08.22]What?
[22:08.82]Why didn't they do anything?
[22:13.58]I don't understand why they didn't do anything.
[22:17.09]I literally aimed the gun and shot the guy in the head.
[22:19.45]Everyone was aiming at me.
[22:20.41]He doesn't even flinch.
[22:25.15]And when he hits you?
[22:26.05]I thought that shit about seeing stars was just in cartoons.
[22:30.61]He who?
[22:32.07]I'm going to do this to everybody here.
[22:36.62]I'm going to hit every single person here.
[22:46.30]Should I?
[22:48.60]Crest appears impressed and has requested to talk with you.
[22:51.34]Oh wait, that's me talking to me.
[22:55.80]What's up?
[22:56.50]Okay.
[22:56.82]Are we going to go with a bodyguard?
[23:17.13]Hey, are you the guy that can clearly kick the shit out of every bodyguard I have?
[23:21.72]Stronger than all my men?
[23:22.84]Come over here in private with me, alone.
[23:25.32]I'm the wicked rich guy.
[23:28.06]Why would we do this alone?
[23:30.50]Should I just do it now?
[23:31.82]Oh my god, there are two bodyguards here.
[23:33.48]I was supposed to strangle him.
[23:38.60]Not the prettiest corner of the island, but we should be out of earshot now.
[23:41.84]Practical.
[23:42.72]I've been planning some operations.
[23:45.85]bro you're gonna stand right next to the red barrel this guy was talking shit earlier about cartoons you're in one right now what you're standing right next to the red explosive barrel heists if you want to be hollywood about it certain prominent individuals government facilities big targets okay

[24:12.06]Excuse me?
[24:12.30]What?
[24:40.29]Why was he itching his wrists?
[24:41.69]The guy was itchy.
[24:43.19]He didn't even, why did it not explode?
[24:44.59]Hold on.
[24:47.91]Why did it not explode?
[24:49.05]He was just itching his arm.
[24:54.14]Hold on.
[25:12.76]I'm gonna hide.
[25:14.14]Where am I going?
[25:20.16]What happened?
[25:25.35]Should I do it for real?
[25:27.19]I gotta do it for real.
[25:28.03]I gotta do it for real.
[25:30.31]I have to do that mission for real.
[25:41.82]Let me do it for real.
[25:42.62]I'm gonna do it for real.
[25:43.72]I'll do it for real.
[25:44.34]I'm gonna do it for real.
[25:45.10]Alright, I'm gonna do it for real, for real, for real.
[25:49.22]No more fucking around.
[25:56.80]I probably could have poisoned his cigar or something.
[26:01.79]Certain prominent individuals, government facilities, big targets.
[26:06.41]But that means big payouts.
[26:08.53]I'm looking for someone who can take a little punishment.
[26:11.27]Someone who can be an inside man.
[26:12.75]I won't buckle under intense interrogation if he's caught.
[26:15.89]I'd do it myself, but my time and expertise would be better spent covering our tracks.
[26:20.26]And you've shown me that my guys aren't up for the job either.
[26:24.08]I need someone I can depend on.
[26:25.62]I can hold my own.
[26:27.00]I know we only just met, but you have this...
[26:29.68]quality to you I can't really pin it down it's familiar but alien at the same time and your face don't take this the wrong way but it feels like if I looked away for a minute I'd completely forget every feature
[26:42.00]You might be my missing piece here.
[26:44.10]I don't need or want a decision right now.
[26:46.24]This is a life-changing choice.
[26:47.86]I know we just met.
[26:48.70]It could be the start of some big things for you, but there would be no backing out.
[26:52.55]I don't need any more disappointments.
[26:54.89]Make sure this is what you really want.
[26:57.85]I'll be here for a few more days at least, so no rush.
[27:01.07]I'll think about it.
[27:04.96]What happened?
[27:05.92]What's going on?
[27:08.50]Can I say yes?
[27:10.60]What was that?
[27:17.27]No, fuck you!
[27:18.23]I wanted his outfit!
[27:20.54]No, shit!
[27:30.86]I wanted the outfit.
[27:35.47]Oh, God damn it.
[27:36.59]I swear to God.
[27:37.53]Just puncture the barrel.
[27:39.19]Yeah, I'll do it.
[27:41.16]How do I say I'll do it?
[27:43.26]How do I say yes, I'll do it?
[27:44.18]I can hold my own.
[27:44.70]I know we only just met, but you have this quality.
[28:08.66]Press X. I think I have to go find him again.
[28:11.70]But if I go get a different disguise, won't he not know who I am?
[28:14.10]Okay.
[28:14.20]No backing out.
[28:14.58]I'll do it.
[28:14.88]Okay.
[28:35.99]Yes.
[28:36.95]Okay.
[28:37.35]Alright, so I was fine.
[28:40.54]I freaked out.
[28:42.02]Okay, sounds good.
[28:42.74]Yes, I'll do it.
[28:47.10]So now I'll just have to go talk to him again.
[28:49.92]Thank you.
[28:50.44]Alright, goodbye.
[28:57.12]I need to find out what that is.
[28:58.68]Right?
[28:59.06]Like, what's going on here?
[29:01.20]Is somebody in this house moaning?
[29:04.69]Why?
[29:07.47]They're in there.
[29:08.01]Am I allowed to go in here?
[29:41.13]We can't enjoy the fucking movie.
[29:43.35]We can't hear anything.
[29:44.25]All right, let's watch it.
[29:46.59]Turn off the projector.
[29:56.13]What happens if I do this?
[29:57.37]That's...

[30:25.94]You must have seen something.
[30:27.58]Right, sir?
[30:28.57]Come on, then.

[32:52.47]You're not going to sit down and watch the YouTube video, right?
[32:56.51]No, you're not going to come back and watch the YouTube video.
[33:14.61]Did I win?
[33:16.77]Wait, there's another person to kill.

[34:09.66]Does he remember?
[34:10.22]Do you remember me?
[34:12.20]You're a regular troublemaker, you know?
[34:17.44]Hey, you there!

[34:46.36]Do it for real.
[34:46.86]Do it for real.
[34:47.98]I can't help it.
[34:48.52]It's like... Oh, no.
[34:49.86]Alright, so I gotta go back and talk to that guy.
[34:57.12]Superficial values of fame and beauty.
[35:01.98]Okay, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[35:03.28]So I gotta go talk to that guy and say I'll do it.
[35:05.16]Where'd he go, up here?
[35:11.24]Yeah, alright, so he's over there.
[35:14.55]Newspaper, I'll take it.
[35:18.29]I keep thinking somebody is hitting me in the fucking face in real life.

[35:44.95]Okay.
[35:45.33]Okay.
[35:45.73]Is this weird to do this?
[35:46.85]Probably.
[36:13.39]I mean, is it weird to do this?
[36:14.99]I mean, kind of odd, but is it really going to get me in trouble?
[36:17.64]Alright, I'm going to go talk to that guy.
[36:38.53]He's like, come find me if you want to actually do the thing.
[36:41.21]Alright, let's go.
[36:42.73]I want to do like a fun mission.
[36:45.19]I just want to throw fish at people.
[36:51.22]God damn it.
[36:52.16]Okay, this is interesting.
[36:53.10]Whatever this is.
[37:00.18]What's going on in here?
[37:11.45]There's always a chef.
[37:14.45]Have you guys noticed that?
[37:15.20]There's always just the kitchen with the kitchen knife and the chef where you can poison the meat.
[37:23.50]Really?
[37:23.74]Oh, I guess I'm not alone.
[37:33.60]You don't... He didn't seem to really give a shit.
[37:35.79]Okay.
[37:38.59]What can I do in here?
[37:45.17]Can they see?
[37:45.63]What happened?
[38:07.44]I need to get a disguise.
[38:09.70]Or just say fuck it and not go in.
[38:21.94]There's not a good opportunity for a disguise.
[38:23.60]Where's my coin?
[38:31.10]I have this mission going already.
[38:32.44]Let me just do this one.
[38:33.80]This seems like the best idea.
[38:35.18]He's like, come find me.
[38:38.06]And tell me if you want to do it or not.
[38:39.38]So let's go do it.
[38:42.48]Do I just walk up to him?
[38:49.36]Alright, I'm ready.
[38:53.85]I'm ready to do your fucking weird mission.
[38:56.43]Alright, I'm ready to do the mission.

[39:44.40]Subdue.
[39:44.93]No, I'm not going to subdue.
[39:45.89]I'm not going to.
[39:46.75]That's such a simple way to do this.
[39:49.93]He said, I need a man like you to be able to, you know, fucking take, you know, pain or something, right?
[39:57.91]Whatever he said.
[40:05.93]But the last two or three straight minutes, I've been LARPing as this guy's security guard.
[40:11.50]I mean, I... There's got to be a way I can activate this, right?
[40:27.47]That was the chance to kill him.
[40:30.21]Oh, but I thought he wanted to make... Join me... Like, we join... Oh, now he's back watching the slap fight again.
[40:36.56]What if I do the slap fight again?

[40:45.12]I'm the slap guy.
[40:46.00]What?

[47:41.94]Okay.
[47:42.64]What's that?
[47:43.32]Hold on.

[53:20.31]Where's that camera?
[53:43.49]They don't care.
[53:44.13]I'm allowed to be down here.
[53:45.15]I'm in the uniform, right?
[53:47.45]Okay, never mind.
[54:26.73]Really?
[54:30.65]What are the weird cartoon objects do I have?

[55:41.00]Stop talking to me!
[56:00.49]Holy shit, there's a stalactite.
[56:11.40]I have to stalactite somebody, right?
[56:27.61]I got him.
[56:35.89]You're like on a security job and one of your co-workers gets killed by a stalactite.
[56:41.26]You're not gonna... You're not gonna go investigate that?
[56:44.58]Alright, what is this?
[56:50.87]Fuse?
[56:55.27]Oh.
[56:57.43]Screwdriver, thank god, finally.
[57:11.52]Oh, it does.

[57:37.17]x hey uh like joey uh there was another accident another stalactite these were sharp and small oh this person's coming to the generator just slowly clear this whole remote
[58:08.29]That'll make a ton of noise.
[58:09.07]I don't want to do that.
[58:10.33]Let me piano wire this guy.
[58:12.09]What was that?
[58:26.92]Command, I've got someone on the ground.
[58:29.59]I'm moving in.
[58:43.90]I'm going to set these motherfuckers up.
[58:45.70]I'm going to set all five of these guys underneath the stalactite.
[58:50.78]So it's just like they were all sitting here having a smoke break and this giant stalactite killed everybody.
[58:56.80]Perfect.
[59:04.41]A tactical shotgun.
[59:05.33]Hell yeah.
[59:31.02]Yep.
[59:33.56]You found something?
[59:36.51]No one's turning the generator off.
[59:39.61]Only two more people.
[59:43.67]That's it.
[60:05.17]He's gonna hear the generator.
[60:06.21]Actually, you know what?
[60:07.65]Fuck it.

[60:24.30]Command!
[60:24.62]You there?
[60:25.53]We've got a situation.
[60:26.39]It's probably some punk kid making life miserable for everyone.
[60:34.12]Some punk kid.
[60:36.36]All right, I've successfully infiltrated.
[60:42.84]Okay, hold on.
[60:44.38]No one else is here, right?
[60:48.49]Laptop files.
[60:53.05]Crest wasn't planning to sell the control unit back to them at all.
[60:56.69]He was going to use the damn thing.
[60:59.85]I suppose I was selling him short.
[61:01.82]okay should I take the rack did I do it safety is on what do you mean safety's on oh
[61:33.19]Let's go!
[61:33.57]Let's go.
[61:34.65]Alright, hell yeah.
[61:35.29]Let me get some extra stuff though.
[61:36.77]There's all kinds of like goodies here.
[62:04.93]Alright, not bad.
[62:06.89]Now I'm going to go turn on the bat signal.
[62:16.72]Anything else I can do?
[62:17.56]That's it.
[62:17.88]Alright, let's go.
[62:20.62]So from here I'm going to go drop disguise.
[62:24.23]Pirate.
[62:24.59]Oh.
[62:24.67]I'm going to head this way.
[62:27.77]Get out of the cave.
[62:31.34]You need to kill the witnesses.
[62:32.22]They're not going to get up.
[62:33.56]Those other two people will be dead far before I have to do that.
[62:43.17]It's not coming this way, right?
[62:48.31]Yeah, these guys, the two targets will be dead before they wake up.
[62:50.73]And even if they do wake up, what, you woke up in a cave and four people died by a stalactite.
[62:55.21]Does that really matter?
[62:55.87]I'm going to be fine.
[63:00.63]I need to get rid of this.
[63:01.89]Don't aim the fucking gun.
[63:03.45]Throw it.
[63:03.85]How do I get rid of the gun?
[63:05.43]I don't want two guns on me at all times.
[63:11.52]Okay.
[63:12.14]Let's go do the bat signal.
[63:15.84]Z?
[63:16.16]Okay, that's fine.
[63:20.17]Alright, that's better.
[63:20.75]Alright, let's set up the meeting.
[63:31.82]I should be allowed in here, right?
[63:37.18]Aren't I like personal private security?
[63:40.86]Please don't search me.
[63:41.96]Alright, you guys remember in the mask?
[63:46.01]When they're like, freeze!
[63:47.23]And they start going through his pants and there's rubber chickens and clocks.
[63:52.77]This is a lot of stuff to have to get rid of.
[63:54.09]I need to be a pirate.
[63:57.40]I have a pirate disguise literally right over.
[63:59.90]Okay, well I'm going to go get it.
[64:15.57]Lock the hole in the sandcastle?
[64:17.05]That seems just kind of... What's that for?
[64:23.95]Let me get the pirate costume.
[64:39.62]Okay, I thought one of them got up.
[64:46.70]Alright, so now I should be able to get in there.
[64:49.74]Why is that evil?
[64:59.73]Alright, that person can see through.
[65:03.16]Nobody else can, right?
[65:04.26]No, we're good.
[65:04.74]Alright, through here.
[65:07.28]I want to turn that thing on.
[65:14.98]We're good.
[65:15.98]Oh!
[65:16.93]Oops.
[65:20.01]Do you stay this way, or can you please turn?
[65:40.02]Okay.
[65:48.44]Fucking camera.
[65:52.21]Don't take my picture.
[65:55.15]Doesn't really matter.
[65:59.19]What the fuck?
[66:05.81]Huh?
[66:09.88]I thought I had a crowbar.
[66:22.68]I don't care if I get seen, doesn't matter.
[66:31.26]Keep your eyes on the toy soldiers.
[66:33.07]They're up to something.
[66:34.25]Yeah.
[66:38.99]Oh my God.
[66:39.43]Can I get in there?
[66:55.22]Shh, don't say that!
[66:56.67]Friend of yours, 47?
[66:58.01]Just don't, why would you say that?
[67:02.63]Mr. Smith.
[67:03.25]Oh, you're a sight for sore eyes, 47.
[67:09.81]I'm on real thin ice with Interpol.
[67:12.74]This assignment was supposed to be a gimme.
[67:15.04]Tag along undercover on some tankers, monitor the crews for any suspicious contact with pirates, support local law enforcement investigations with whatever info I found.
[67:24.73]Should have been a piece of cake.
[67:26.35]Do you need some help?
[67:27.63]Yeah.
[67:29.07]I haven't heard any keys on their leader when she comes by.
[67:31.71]If I had to guess, I'd say she's keeping them somewhere private, like an office.
[67:34.95]An office.
[67:35.85]If you can get those keys and open this door, I can get myself off this island.
[67:40.27]Got it.
[67:40.73]Okay.
[67:42.33]Turn up the volume.
[67:43.59]Okay.
[67:43.77]Is that better?
[67:49.81]Alright, I need to find the keys.
[67:53.17]They're probably in an office.
[67:55.58]Whatever this is, I'm touching it.
[68:02.01]Turn that off!
[68:02.39]Turn it off!
[68:02.71]I don't know what I just did.
[68:03.33]Turn it off!
[68:03.65]Turn it off!
[68:03.93]Turn it off!
[68:04.25]I'm sorry.
[68:04.55]I don't know what that does.
[68:08.16]I can't turn that off.
[68:17.91]Did I fuck it up?
[68:19.13]I think I screwed it all up.
[68:21.37]I messed the whole thing up, didn't I?
[68:29.05]All right, I gotta get I gotta knock these guys out and then use the printer or whatever that is Pick up your phone.
[68:51.91]You can't even look at the display and see who it is and pick up Are you that useless?
[68:59.51]Oh, yes.
[69:00.31]I was hoping he was in.
[69:02.11]When will he be back?
[69:07.76]Oh, my God.
[69:08.16]I have so much stupid bullshit in my inventory.
[69:10.79]I don't even... Whatever.
[69:13.05]I need something quiet.
[69:17.77]What's the quietest thing I have here?
[69:21.51]Probably a knife.
[69:23.13]Or this.
[69:25.73]The fish is quiet?
[69:26.49]The fish is not quiet.
[69:27.49]What does that do?
[69:28.27]I don't even need to be in here.
[69:31.66]Is there a key anywhere?
[69:56.02]There's no key here.
[69:57.29]It's probably upstairs.
[70:29.73]I'm gonna stay over here, right?
[70:31.35]Probably up here.
[70:36.72]Oh, shit.
[70:37.32]Okay, let's go.
[70:37.92]Go, go, go.
[70:38.22]What do we got?
[70:42.12]Notes?
[70:43.28]Intel.
[70:45.12]Rough accumulation of intel about Crest and the militia, in addition to Akka's calculations about the value of the satellite itself, where notes outline what Crest stands to gain from blackmailing Ether and their clients with its data.
[70:57.57]Wow.
[70:58.81]There it is.
[70:59.17]Got the key.
[71:05.04]Holy shit.
[71:05.92]This thing is insane.
[71:08.20]Um... Throw this out the window. ...
[71:23.16]I got the key.
[71:23.60]Was there anything else in here that I needed?
[71:24.76]I've got the key.
[71:26.40]I'm going to drop down.
[71:28.60]All right, let's go.
[71:36.01]Now what?
[71:49.59]I'm going to ask you again.
[71:51.77]Who the hell are you?
[71:53.01]And what were you doing on that tanker?
[71:54.85]I don't remember.
[71:56.57]If you don't start talking, I'll cut one of those ears of yours off.
[72:00.09]Whether or not I know who to send it to.
[72:01.88]Hey, you!
[72:03.84]What?
[72:05.02]What happened?
[72:06.28]What did I?
[72:06.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[72:09.04]Now all that's left to deal with.
[72:11.00]What did I do?
[72:11.86]Noel crest himself.
[72:12.98]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[72:26.43]The fucker's gone.
[72:28.04]He's not here anymore.
[72:32.20]I said car back.
[72:35.00]I fucking electrified everybody.
[72:48.73]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[72:50.21]Did you drop anything?
[72:53.24]An access hub?
[72:54.86]Key?
[72:55.76]Wait, hold on.
[72:56.26]Open this door.
[73:00.09]Oh!
[73:00.93]Are they coming in?
[73:05.01]No?
[73:05.23]We're okay.
[73:11.39]Data entry.
[73:13.97]And... I don't know.
[73:17.11]Whatever.
[73:17.47]Go.
[73:17.83]Get out.
[73:25.05]Fuck.
[73:25.49]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[73:26.77]I don't.
[73:27.05]I don't.
[73:27.37]Just come in and investigate.
[73:28.35]Do whatever you need to do.
[73:29.19]Bye.
[73:30.99]Don't shoot him.
[73:31.47]Just run.
[73:32.51]I'm good.
[73:32.83]Save it.
[73:34.83]That is not how you're supposed to do that.
[73:40.11]Okay.
[73:40.67]So, that leaves us with the bat signal.
[74:12.77]Kick a bag of bricks?
[74:21.40]Am I gonna kick a bag of bricks on this guy?
[74:47.56]Here he comes.
[74:47.96]That guy doesn't know the meeting got cancelled.
[74:50.52]He doesn't know that I killed all the people down here.
[74:53.44]He has no idea.
[75:01.15]This guy has absolutely no clue.
[75:14.86]What is this guy doing up here?
[75:22.99]Did I get him?
[75:23.97]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[75:25.50]He's coming.
[75:25.92]He's on his way.
[75:26.44]Dude, I could probably just go, like...
[75:55.05]That's crest taken care of.
[76:01.56]It's time to go 47.
[76:07.36]I'll do it the right way.
[76:08.54]I'll do it the right way.
[76:14.05]I'll do it the right way.
[76:15.15]Relax.
[76:32.98]So this just drops down here.
[76:34.62]Did they actually even walk by this?
[76:45.73]Where's he going?
[76:46.23]Wait, where are all the dead bodies?
[76:51.85]They got rid of all the dead bodies.
[76:57.13]What distraction.
[77:01.39]This guy's not up here, is he?
[77:26.15]Oh, there he goes.
[77:34.19]Is he leaving?
[77:36.07]Investigate that.
[77:36.91]How far can I throw something?
[78:08.25]The meeting is not in the tower.
[78:09.93]That makes sense.
[78:14.97]You're right.
[78:16.55]Why would the meeting be in the tower?
[78:17.93]You're right.
[78:18.53]Yeah, that's weird.
[78:19.31]Oh, well, let's just kill whoever this is.
[78:30.15]What was I thinking?
[78:30.94]I don't know.
[78:31.22]This seems like a secluded place.
[78:35.50]No, fuck that.
[78:36.76]When Commissioner Gordon does the bat signal, Batman goes to the bat signal.
[78:41.86]On the roof.
[78:43.50]That's how it, in every single movie.
[78:45.43]Every single TV show.
[78:52.71]I have a sword now.
[78:55.79]Alright, whatever.
[78:58.90]I'm just gonna go kill him.
[78:59.88]Save it.
[79:07.92]Where is he?
[79:11.14]I'm going to go slash this guy with a sword.
[79:12.80]You know what I mean?
[79:13.30]Like, who cares?
[79:14.06]Shit, I went the wrong way.
[79:27.52]Come on, really?
[79:34.46]Metal worker?
[79:35.28]No.
[79:38.20]Oh, hi.
[79:39.33]Hello.
[79:39.59]Alright, let's go this way.
[79:51.65]That's probably an escape route right there.
[79:52.99]Alright, fuck this guy.
[80:00.74]I've had enough.
[80:20.41]I'll get him alone here.
[80:21.33]He goes around the corner.
[80:22.25]When he goes around the corner, I'll go for him.
[80:30.92]This is way more hilarious.
[80:42.37]I took a quarter out of my pocket.
[80:43.61]Fuck off.
[80:45.13]What's so weird about that?
[80:47.01]What did I lose?
[80:47.79]What are you talking about?
[80:48.49]I took a quarter.
[80:50.01]Oh.
[80:52.88]Actually, thank you.
[80:53.60]I appreciate that.
[80:55.56]Usually people would just be like, you know, don't give a shit about somebody dropping something.
[81:00.47]I really appreciate it.
[81:01.15]Thank you.
[81:02.59]You thought I was going to hit him in the face with the paddle, didn't you?
[81:05.39]I would have if it said the text came up, but it didn't.
[81:08.03]Stop.
[81:08.17]Just focus.
[81:08.73]Oh, shit.
[81:09.13]You wanted a coconut.
[81:09.91]Where do I get one?
[81:24.31]Where do you actually get a coconut?
[81:25.49]I wanna do that.
[81:40.96]How do you actually get a coconut?
[81:56.05]No!
[81:56.38]I wanted to hit him with the- I wanted to hit him with the pa- I wanted to hit him with the board.
[82:12.03]I was waiting for- I don't know, why can't I hit him with the board?
[82:19.69]I'm about to just throw it at this guy and run.
[82:34.45]You know what I mean?
[82:35.09]I might as well.
[82:36.21]The exit's probably right here.
[82:37.19]I don't fucking care anymore.
[82:52.87]Whatever.
[82:53.19]I genuinely don't care.
[82:59.49]How do I get this guy alone?
[83:04.20]Enable your VOD?
[83:05.10]It should be there.
[83:07.28]How do I get this guy alone?
[83:15.23]Shoot him from the tower.
[83:16.09]That's easier.
[83:16.57]I was throwing a fucking knife in his head.
[83:22.23]That's Crest taken care of.
[83:33.25]Get your head in the game.
[84:01.13]I had to do it.
[84:02.83]I had to do it.
[84:05.47]You know I did.
[84:12.66]I had to do it.
[84:13.34]I had to do it.
[84:14.02]I had to do it.
[84:14.58]I had to do it.
[84:15.04]I don't care if I failed the mission.
[84:16.72]I had to hit that guy in the face.
[84:18.55]But the video, because they're going to edit the video right when I hit him in the face.
[84:21.39]It's going to cut to the next clip, which is coming up here shortly.
[84:42.09]That's Crest taken care of.
[84:45.10]And that's that.
[84:45.88]The rest will pick up the pieces.
[84:48.68]It's time to go, 47.
[84:49.54]I'll see you soon.
[85:12.77]That was scary.
[85:44.11]What?
[85:44.47]You're talking to me?
[85:53.64]Wait, wait.
[85:55.72]Are you asking me for help?
[85:59.27]I'm so confused what happened.
[86:00.27]I don't care.
[86:13.72]What was that?
[86:22.93]What is that?
[86:29.79]It was a Homer Simpson scream.
[86:42.41]Alright, I got 20,000 XP.
[86:44.83]And... Oh, okay.
[86:47.25]Unfortunately... Unfortunately, you got one star.
[86:52.69]Zero, actually.
[86:57.21]That was kind of a fun mission.
[87:07.50]Ooh, alright.
[87:09.98]Cool.
[87:11.24]Cool.
[87:11.34]Cool.
[87:13.31]That was kind of fun.
[87:23.71]New personal best.
[87:24.53]That's the first time I've ever played it.
[87:30.42]Is this the only DLC map?
[87:32.68]Are there any more DLC maps?
[87:37.74]I want to see what the sword looks like when you hit somebody with it.
[87:45.22]That's fucking brutal.
[87:46.16]Okay.
[87:46.28]Are there any more?
[88:10.58]It's quick.
[88:11.64]It's very quick.
[88:12.12]Does it kill instantly?
[88:13.52]This is not knocking people out, right?
[88:16.16]It's fast and it kills people.
[88:17.80]That's kind of crazy.
[88:21.86]Alright, well that was fun.
[88:23.54]Let me see.
[88:23.92]Anything else to do?
[88:24.90]Otherwise we'll play some multiverses.
[88:26.95]We'll move to multiverses after this.
[88:31.49]Played the scary card game.
[88:32.91]I did.
[88:33.85]I played scary card game.
[88:41.22]Save the guy, the people, people in the cage.
[88:44.00]It's over.
[88:48.54]Do Outer Wilds DLC?
[88:49.58]I probably will eventually.
[88:51.78]But like I heard it was kind of a little too puzzle based.
[88:55.63]I heard I wouldn't be very bad at it.
[88:57.47]I heard that I would not have fun playing it.
[88:59.05]That's what I was told.
[89:02.01]Walk the plank of shame?
[89:09.25]Outer Wilds DLC.
[89:13.29]They lied to you.
[89:14.13]Okay.
[89:14.97]Alright, let's do multiverses.
[89:16.01]I'm ready to play.
[89:16.79]I've been kind of obsessed with this game.
[89:22.43]This is also going to be a sponsor segment.
[89:24.59]I've been playing this game a shitload on the couch sick on my Xbox.
[89:28.30]I'm ready to game.
[89:30.32]That was fun, though.
[89:32.84]What about... VOD is still private.
[89:34.54]Why?
[89:36.20]Why does Twitch keep changing this shit?
[89:38.90]It shouldn't be.
[89:42.00]Let's see.
[89:42.30]Hold on.
[89:46.62]Yeah, why is this not published?
[89:49.04]I changed this setting.
[89:51.50]I changed this setting like three days ago.
[89:53.23]What the hell?
[89:58.75]If I publish this right now, will it actually go through?
[90:01.04]That's kind of annoying.
[90:07.14]Publish this.
[90:14.14]Okay.
[90:15.24]Is it there?
[90:16.90]Please confirm with me that you can see it.
[90:18.68]I hope so.
[90:29.83]Yeah, I went into my settings and I changed this already.
[90:33.15]This has already been changed.
[90:39.22]What is it under?
[90:41.12]Stream settings?
[90:44.29]Store always publish VODs.
[90:46.43]Dude, I did this already.
[90:51.68]Why are you doing this to me?
[90:52.64]Okay, that's whatever.
[90:53.62]All right, let's do multiverses.
[91:00.37]Let's open it.
[91:03.55]I'm going to do a quick BRB for one second because I need to set up a chatbot and stuff.
[91:06.95]So give me one sec.
[91:11.07]Got to be playing a lot of LeBron.
[91:13.13]LeBron is really fun, really good.
[91:14.70]I'll be right back.
