[00:58.69]Hey, how are you?
[01:05.87]That's it Okay, so I just looked up and I said hey, how are you?
[01:11.63]And I looked down at my phone and like forgot I was live-streaming It's like hey, how are you?
[01:17.19]And I'm like down on my phone again like I forget I'll make a tweet.
[01:22.28]How's everybody doing?
[01:24.55]I apologize about the fact that there were no streams this weekend.
[01:30.04]I have a, you know, that illness that I have sometimes decides to show up.
[01:36.72]And it did.
[01:39.32]High IQ.
[01:39.86]Yeah, it's alright, I'm good.
[01:43.37]We're good to go.
[01:44.97]Don't worry about me.
[01:45.57]I'm gonna be fine.
[01:49.32]I do have something to talk about before we get started.
[01:52.14]There is something to talk about, Mike.
[01:53.82]What the fuck is this?
[01:55.54]Shut up, Jeremy.
[01:57.94]Uh, maybe you saw on Twitter earlier.
[02:04.40]The disease is called late streaming.
[02:06.08]No, no, no.
[02:08.69]No, let's go over this.
[02:10.71]Because there's pros and cons to every situation.
[02:14.37]There's pros and cons to every place you shop and place you go.
[02:17.11]And I need to get this off my chest.
[02:19.35]I just have to.
[02:20.41]There's no rhyme or reason without me talking about it.
[02:24.45]So I went to Whole Foods today.
[02:27.15]Whole Foods, that's right.
[02:28.83]The store, the shop that has the really, really great stuff.
[02:33.71]Really, really high quality organic food.
[02:35.53]No, it's so organic and so delicious and stuff, right?
[02:39.96]Versus something like a stop and shop.
[02:42.95]So, go to Whole Foods today.
[02:45.95]And get in line behind the fish counter.
[02:50.03]And made it very, very clear.
[02:52.14]Extremely clear to the guy behind the counter that, like, hey, I'm looking to look for something.
[02:56.14]We made eye contact.
[02:57.54]And, like, I didn't want to buy my fish immediately.
[02:59.56]You know what I mean?
[03:00.02]Because you don't want to buy... You want to buy your... Your produce and shit is fine, but meats you want to buy last because you don't want to be walking around the store with, like, fucking raw meat in your cart for, like, 40 minutes, right?
[03:10.08]So, get there, make eye contact, guy says, hey, do you need something?
[03:15.08]Nah, I'm good for now, I'm good right now, I'll see you in a little bit.
[03:17.76]Like, I'm gonna make my wraparound, and I'm gonna buy some shrimp and some salmon.
[03:22.09]He's like, oh, cool, man, cool.
[03:24.53]So, 25 minutes go by, wrap around the store, get there again, and there's people, there's one person in line in front of me.
[03:31.86]And they didn't buy anything.
[03:33.08]They haven't bought anything yet.
[03:34.88]They're having a conversation with the guy behind the counter about sustainable seafood.
[03:41.96]And they won't stop.
[03:43.32]And they literally are talking for like 10 straight minutes.
[03:47.41]I'm like making eye contact.
[03:48.57]I'm sitting right behind the fucking person.
[03:51.14]It's just like, could I get served?
[03:54.47]Am I gonna get like served here?
[03:56.51]And they just keep talking.
[03:58.65]They keep talking about fucking like sustainable seafood efforts.
[04:02.11]And they start exchanging cards.
[04:04.07]Like we're at a fucking seafood convention.
[04:06.91]It's like, what the fuck are you doing?
[04:09.39]And I almost, I almost did this.
[04:11.59]And I'm all for fucking sustainable seafood.
[04:14.47]I'm all for that kind of shit.
[04:15.97]But I was seconds away from literally being like, excuse me, where's the fish that they stuff in the container?
[04:23.81]And they like shit all over each other and it's terrible for the environment.
[04:27.29]Can I get that right now, please?
[04:29.93]And it would have fucking ruined everybody involved's day.
[04:33.51]It would have fucking thrown them all.
[04:34.59]It would have ruined that fucking lady's week.
[04:37.15]If I had said that.
[04:39.21]And like, I was thinking about doing it.
[04:40.63]I was gonna be like, hey, give me the one where they shit all over each other.
[04:43.23]Where's like the worst one?
[04:47.04]But I didn't.
[04:49.08]And it made me angry.
[04:50.64]Because I was at Whole Foods for like an extra 25 minutes.
[04:53.16]You know what I'm saying?
[04:58.10]We were there for fucking an extra 25 minutes.
[05:00.28]And then I go to the deli counter.
[05:03.26]And lo and behold, the deli counter as well.
[05:06.34]Having a fucking conversation about cheese.
[05:09.62]And how delicious the cheese is.
[05:11.36]And where it comes from.
[05:12.92]I don't care where it comes from.
[05:14.84]I just want it to be good.
[05:16.21]And I want you to give it to me.
[05:18.19]Left Whole Foods without any cheese.
[05:19.91]Without any deli meat.
[05:20.93]Without any fucking seafood.
[05:23.77]What's going on here?
[05:25.95]If I go to Stop and Shop, or if I go to like one of these fucking big box stores, and every one of them talks shit about the big box stores.
[05:30.88]Oh, it's a big box store.
[05:31.74]Don't go there.
[05:32.26]Buy organic.
[05:33.50]I get in line, I'm bang.
[05:34.94]What do you need?
[05:35.82]You want fucking Swiss cheese?
[05:36.94]Got it.
[05:37.38]Ten seconds.
[05:37.96]Here it is.
[05:38.98]You want a piece of salmon?
[05:40.22]Bingo.
[05:40.76]Got it.
[05:41.58]I promise you, they shit all over each other.
[05:43.20]Take it.
[05:47.59]Welcome to the stream.
[05:52.36]Stop having conversations.
[05:53.82]I'm not!
[05:54.46]I'm the one, I'm the guy in line behind everybody that has like fucking shopping, like grocery store conversations.
[06:01.45]Don't have a conversation in the grocery store.
[06:03.55]If you see one of your friends in the grocery store, give them a nod and keep walking.
[06:08.31]If you want to ask a question, grab one of the guys that are fucking walking around the aisles.
[06:14.86]The grocery store, you go to the grocery store and you buy your food and you get the fuck out of there.
[06:17.78]Because it's food.
[06:19.91]We shouldn't be so concerned about having conversations with each other.
[06:26.44]Get in the line, goddamn it, and fucking buy what you need and then go home.
[06:30.66]Go home to your piece of shit kids and your fucking husband that doesn't love you.
[06:36.58]Leave me and give me my fucking seafood.
[06:38.70]I don't care if it's sustainable.
[06:40.02]I do.
[06:40.94]I do care.
[06:46.12]Calm down.
[06:47.60]Oh, fucking frog's legs.
[06:49.54]Let me tell you about frog's legs.
[06:50.76]Didn't get my frog's legs either, but now the game is taunting me.
[06:56.68]Unsocial streamer.
[06:57.76]Oh, wait a minute.
[06:59.07]Hold on.
[07:06.23]Where's my telekinesis?
[07:08.83]Can I grab these through the bars?
[07:12.72]I can.
[07:13.18]That's awesome.
[07:14.12]Anything else there that I didn't get?
[07:19.44]Alright, we're good.
[07:19.92]I don't think there's anything else I can do there.
[07:27.82]Angry streamer.
[07:28.72]Hold on.
[07:31.20]Shit, hopefully this doesn't break the game.
[07:32.34]I gotta like move a couple things.
[07:33.90]Come on, don't break.
[07:35.58]Don't break, otherwise I'll complain about that.
[07:38.38]Don't you break on me.
[07:39.47]We will be complaining about that if you do.
[07:43.77]Oh god, come on.
[07:45.97]Hey, that could have gone on a lot longer than seven minutes.
[07:50.17]That was not long at all, actually.
[07:51.81]I can do better than that.
[07:55.59]Uh, move that.
[07:58.23]Professional complainer.
[08:00.27]It's true, though.
[08:01.13]Like, if you go... Look, I got a thing when, like, you're talking about, like, people's, like, money and shit.
[08:09.02]I got a thing.
[08:11.66]If I'm in the line at, like, a grocery store, or, like, even at, like, a fucking carnival...
[08:17.85]And, like, the guy that's, like, running the carnival.
[08:21.37]Like, people, like, walk in front of me and shit like that.
[08:23.27]Like, have you seen people, like, skip the fucking line at the carnival?
[08:26.83]And you want to, like, grab them by the fucking back of the shirt and be like, Excuse me!
[08:30.81]But you don't.
[08:31.33]You let them be an asshole and you hope that they get caught.
[08:33.09]Can I jump in this?
[08:36.27]Can I use this rock for something?
[08:40.07]No.
[08:42.73]I kind of haven't been paying any attention.
[08:47.49]I guess we're just going in.
[08:49.25]I'm gonna go in here.
[08:52.06]Apparently this water was gross.
[08:59.20]Was I supposed to not do this?

[16:24.16]Shrink is dumber.
[16:25.08]Shrink sounds really fucking dumb.
[16:27.26]So why would I not do that?

[20:41.59]Upper temple.
[20:43.91]Cow's milk.
[20:47.19]Where is this even trying to point me to?
[20:48.49]Here's a spider sequence.
[20:49.88]I have to open the door, right?
[20:52.74]Don't I open the door with a spider sequence?
[20:58.04]I guess I don't have the spider sequence.
[21:03.42]Is this hot?
[21:07.73]What is it doing to me?
[21:10.01]It's a healing pool.
[21:10.93]Okay.
[21:14.53]It wants me to go that way.
[21:15.69]But I need to check and make sure I don't miss any fucking secrets.
[21:18.95]You couldn't have warned me like five seconds ago?
[21:27.30]As I walk into the trap room, she tells me to wait.
[21:29.22]The first time she's ever warned me.
[21:32.13]So that's the plate.
[21:32.75]Do not step on.
[21:34.03]Okay.
[21:36.09]I haven't saved it!
[21:36.91]Save it!
[21:41.17]Oh boy.
[21:52.35]Staff of the Firebolt.
[21:54.13]Or the Fire Lord.
[21:55.05]Okay, cool.
[21:58.17]These are a lot of scrolls.
[22:00.85]Is this a trap?
[22:04.53]No.
[22:05.01]Okay.
[22:08.27]I need to take a look at that.
[22:11.27]Staff of the Fire.
[22:13.57]Plus 6 against enemies vulnerable to fire.
[22:18.23]I wonder who that is.
[22:19.75]This is plus 3.
[22:21.19]Plus 3.
[22:21.89]Let's just put it on.
[22:22.55]It's better.
[22:22.97]It just is better.
[22:26.01]It's like cool looking.
[22:27.63]Look at that.
[22:27.99]It is a fucking Dark Maul Star Wars shit.
[22:30.03]Look at this.
[22:32.65]I like this thing.
[22:33.33]I'm keeping this thing on.
[22:34.57]I can pretend to be fucking Darth Maul.
[22:40.32]Perfect.
[22:40.96]I can finally live my Star Wars fantasy land.
[22:43.26]And that's how you get by that one.
[22:47.86]Can't open this.
[22:48.52]Okay.
[22:48.66]Let's go across the bridge.
[22:52.56]Save it.
[22:54.83]Knock over the Minecraft sign.
[22:56.19]Oh, sorry, little brother.
[22:58.63]I didn't mean to knock over your one sign that you...
[23:04.40]I probably should put a fire spell on then, huh?
[23:08.10]What do I replace?
[23:13.68]I can't.
[23:14.06]I don't know if I want to replace anything.
[23:15.78]That stupid bow.
[23:16.56]This bow is not doing me any favors right now.
[23:21.96]I can pick this up, though.
[23:22.94]What do I do with it?
[23:23.52]Put it somewhere?
[23:29.32]I can't pull it.
[23:30.10]Come on.
[23:30.38]Get through here.
[23:34.59]They're gonna put this back on like a statue, right?
[23:39.19]Jesus.
[23:40.03]I just like knocked a stool out of the guy's head.
[23:43.63]There we go.
[23:45.20]Which one did that open?
[23:46.28]This one?
[23:48.22]Congratulations, you found a fucking seed.
[23:49.50]There's a lot of blood here, though.
[23:56.22]Save it.
[23:56.72]Let's save scum this.
[23:59.30]There's a goblin's head on the ground.
[24:01.20]What's in here?
[24:03.64]Nothing.
[24:04.87]Really?
[24:05.07]That's it?
[24:05.35]There's nothing here?
[24:05.97]Let's give him a proper burial.
[24:11.75]Let's respect this guy.
[24:19.27]Yeah, proper burial.
[24:24.85]This is a casket.
[24:25.61]Just fucking stuff him in the casket and close it.
[24:34.05]Alright, well, I can't do anything about it.
[24:35.21]There's nothing even in here.
[24:36.13]Is there, like, any wood?
[24:36.98]There's wood.
[24:37.56]No, I can't.
[24:38.10]Whatever.
[24:38.84]This was a fucking bait.
[24:39.70]Alright, fine.
[24:41.28]I got baited with your fake treasure.
[24:46.72]Oh, was that the treasure?
[24:47.54]I don't even know.
[24:50.70]Let's keep going.
[24:54.73]Bring up my staff.
[24:59.55]And move into the mana pool.
[25:01.99]That's definitely what this is.
[25:05.48]Use the funeral bow.
[25:09.77]Which way do they come?
[25:11.89]This way.
[25:15.43]Really kind of convoluted way to go about all this.
[25:17.21]I'm climbing this very slowly.
[25:22.27]Why am I so concerned about this ladder?
[25:25.21]Of any ladder in the whole game, that's the one that I care about the most?
[25:33.38]Nothing?
[25:33.64]Okay.
[25:37.57]Up here.
[25:38.43]I believe this is gonna be the Inner Sanctum.
[25:42.37]Chris was in here.
[25:43.05]I don't care.
[25:43.54]We got our objective done.
[25:44.76]We got our Darth Maul, Chris.
[25:48.02]Got our coffee.
[25:51.50]Source engine ladders.
[25:52.74]Yeah.
[25:55.19]Hey, thank you, Sprite Tech, for the bits.
[26:03.09]Ooh, a bow and arrow.
[26:04.53]Okay, I guess I might need a bow here.
[26:06.73]I already have a bow, but do I have any arrows?
[26:12.25]I got a bone.
[26:14.25]This lady, like, seriously, is not really doing many things to help me here.
[26:20.76]Of course it is.
[26:21.58]We're going to be kicking people off.
[26:31.59]No, we're going to drop this shit on somebody.
[26:33.61]That guy, like, welcome to the game where the guy's just standing there and begs you to kick him off.
[26:43.33]See you later!
[26:45.15]What the fuck?
[26:46.05]What the fuck is happening right now?
[26:51.41]Those didn't make any... Why did they fall like that?
[26:57.28]Okay, that random fucking ball just hit... That barrel just hit that guy on the way up.
[27:04.16]Fucking video games, you know what I mean?
[27:13.92]I'm just gonna go up.
[27:15.64]Fuck it, who cares?
[27:21.39]Oh, they're gonna get fucking logged.
[27:24.61]Don't.
[27:24.89]Get out of my way.
[27:25.41]Get back there.
[27:26.43]Come on.
[27:27.73]Take it off.
[27:29.63]Ram the door.
[27:33.87]Can I just let this log?
[27:34.69]Like, can I home alone these guys?
[27:40.27]I don't think I can home alone these guys.
[27:42.34]I would love to, though.
[27:43.14]Oh, fuck.
[27:48.08]You, fight him.
[27:49.58]You, fight this guy, quick.
[27:51.12]I'm dead.
[27:55.85]I was trying to, like, knock the fucking thing down.
[27:57.59]Like,
[28:02.46]I guess I can't do that.
[28:03.62]Why can I not do this?
[28:07.72]Alright, well, I'm going to kick these guys all down then.
[28:12.25]You guys are going to be fucking assholes about this.
[28:14.05]Then come up here and just lose instantly.
[28:15.63]I'm out of stamina.
[28:26.06]I'm out of fucking stamina.
[28:27.20]Oh my god.
[28:33.42]Jesus Christ.
[28:36.16]What just happened?
[28:41.37]Alright, let's, let's, yeah, do your worst.
[28:43.91]Let's just walk up here again.
[28:46.05]Let me refill my stamina bar.

[29:58.42]Why fight?
[29:58.96]There's no reason to fight.
[30:06.13]And that's it.
[30:07.05]We did it.
[30:07.75]We're fine.
[30:08.89]Everything's good.
[30:09.61]Everything's under control.
[30:12.15]Don't worry about it.
[30:30.30]What about you?

[33:23.38]A bunch are gonna chase after me, and I'm gonna cut the bridge like Dark Souls style.

[33:38.64]This has to happen.
[33:39.82]I don't care how long this takes.

[35:00.14]Yep.
[35:03.61]How do I just restart the level?
[35:07.11]I can't.
[35:08.13]There's no way to do it.
[35:12.11]I can't do it.
[35:14.61]Oh, that's sad.
[35:17.86]Oh, that's very sad to me.
[35:22.31]It's worth it.
[35:22.93]I think it might be.
[35:25.01]I don't know.
[35:25.41]It depends on how far back, like... Do I have, like, any more, like, auto-saves?
[35:33.31]Well, I mean, I have this one, but that's, like... How far away is this one?
[35:41.46]This one, auto... 1141.
[35:42.22]1141.
[35:42.28]Ah.
[35:53.35]To the command change level?
[35:58.63]Console command.
[35:59.15]Alright, well, what's the console command to like restart this level here?
[36:05.54]Because I'm going to sprint by every orc and bring like 30 people to that bridge.
[36:10.82]I have to.
[36:11.74]I have to do that.
[36:12.94]That's such a waste if we don't do that.
[36:20.06]Status is status.
[36:24.77]That's my Steam account.
[36:28.54]That's my Steam ID.
[36:32.32]That's not what I... What?
[36:39.49]Get fucking bombarded.
[36:45.70]Scammed.
[36:52.93]Let's see if that happens.
[36:53.91]Type kill in the console.
[36:56.67]No, that's not going to do it.
[36:59.07]Change level.
[37:03.66]Change level level name.
[37:07.98]What's the name of this level?
[37:10.30]Can I spawn him in?
[37:11.40]I can spawn him in.
[37:13.12]Let's try that.
[37:15.70]MMNPCOrcSpawn100.
[37:17.58]MMNPCOrcSpawn100.
[37:18.74]I've got to copy this.
[37:25.33]We're laughing about it just a little bit here.
[37:29.61]Alright, we got it.
[37:30.51]Let's spawn him in.
[37:33.39]Alright, let's get to the bridge.
[37:34.39]Let's load that save that we have right here.
[37:41.46]Can I handle 100?
[37:42.00]I don't think I can handle 100, guys.
[37:45.76]No, wait, have we already gotten this far?
[37:49.12]I'm not sure.
[37:49.60]I don't know if this is a good idea.
[37:51.08]We've gotten this far already.
[37:52.20]Let's clear this out first.
[37:56.40]We gotta, we gotta like make this like a clean slate here.
[38:00.46]Okay.
[38:02.56]I don't think I can handle a hundred and then a hundred can't even fit right here.
[38:07.80]Let's just go with like 12 or like 20.
[38:13.48]Cause then I can like train them up here.
[38:15.04]Okay.
[38:15.32]We're going to do it.
[38:15.78]Here we go.
[38:16.12]I don't even know if they can all fit.
[38:25.15]Okay, let's go with this.
[38:27.48]Let's just see what happens.
[38:28.46]10.
[38:29.54]Unknown command.
[38:30.98]That doesn't work.
[38:32.72]Is it the right command?
[38:33.42]I don't think that's the right command.
[38:42.04]MMPC Orc Spawn.
[38:43.76]MMPC Create.
[38:48.69]You guys are just cheating me here.
[38:52.67]MMNPC create orc sword Orc sword So it's actually create orc sword Like this
[39:20.23]Attempt to create unknown entity.
[39:21.79]Orc sword.
[39:22.31]That's not a real person.
[39:30.90]Orc sword?
[39:34.92]Create... Yeah, I mean, this is pretty important.
[39:38.28]Unbind all.
[39:39.06]Alright, let me like... Google the... Alt-tapping out of this game is very dangerous.
[39:51.45]Hold on.
[39:51.95]God damn it.
[39:52.77]I can't, like, alt-tab out of this game.
[39:54.11]It just fucking breaks.
[39:56.21]SV Cheats 1 should be on.
[39:57.99]It's SV underscore.
[40:12.58]You forgot the underscore.
[40:13.50]Wait, it has to be an underscore here?
[40:15.68]Okay, I think I did it.
[40:17.76]That's it.
[40:18.00]One came up.
[40:20.90]There's one.
[40:21.38]It gives me one.
[40:31.77]Where are these other nine people being spawned?
[40:45.75]This can't be one again.
[40:48.11]I'm gonna die.
[40:54.78]Bind it?
[40:56.78]No, I'm not gonna bind it.
[40:58.33]No.
[40:59.23]Bind it.
[40:59.81]Maybe, what if, okay, will 100 be 10?
[41:10.27]No, 100, it's just always 1.
[41:12.11]Bind it to W. Alright, we'll bind it to a key.
[41:17.62]We'll bind it to like fucking L or something.
[41:22.30]So how do I do?
[41:22.86]Bind key, right?
[41:24.43]Bind to the scroll wheel.
[41:28.23]Bind G. Like that.

[41:53.79]Like this?
[41:54.69]Or quotes around the command like this?
[42:03.33]Bind to mic.

[46:19.43]We're stuffing these guys in fucking one by one.
[46:21.44]Alright, put like the fucking stupid staff down.
[46:33.88]Can any more fit?
[46:34.70]Can a third one get on there?
[46:38.40]It's gotta be two by two apparently, unless we can stack them on top of each other.
[46:47.42]We're gonna be here for a while.
[46:49.59]We're gonna be here for a while?
[46:52.37]Fuck.
[46:53.31]My computer's gonna break.
[46:55.52]My computer's gonna break.
[46:56.48]I gotta calm down here.
[46:57.38]Calm down.
[47:14.74]We're gonna stack them up like the fucking tower.
[47:18.16]Leaning tower of fucking humans.
[47:24.92]We're gonna have a sardine can of orcs.
[47:29.76]The fucking regular game.
[47:31.02]I can't even play the regular game anymore.
[47:32.74]Why do I do this to myself?
[47:36.21]I don't know why.
[47:36.63]I was playing the game.
[47:38.79]We were fucking halfway through the game.
[47:40.91]I did the same thing with Fallout New Vegas and I can never go back.
[47:44.72]It's never the same ever again, when you start to make screaming orc towers.
[47:58.85]My computer's already chugging.
[48:01.81]I hope this is worth it, because it's going to break my computer.
[48:05.45]This is why I have a fucking, like, $4,000 computer, right?
[48:08.45]It better hold up.
[48:11.79]Aye, aye, aye.
[48:18.02]We might have to stop after this.
[48:19.54]I might have to stop after this layer.
[48:22.46]This is like an orc layer cake.
[48:33.75]This is going to break your ears, by the way.
[48:38.31]Save it?
[48:38.65]Okay, yep.
[48:39.05]Good idea.
[48:41.23]Should I turn the AI back on?
[48:42.74]And see what happens to them?
[48:45.76]Or should I just drop them?
[48:54.59]I'm at like 12 frames a second now.
[48:56.93]This has got to be it.
[49:03.14]I'm going way too far here.
[49:04.90]Too much.
[49:05.28]This is too much.
[49:19.18]Okay.
[49:24.52]I need like a little sword.
[49:26.42]Like a little dagger or something.
[49:35.41]So I can see it.
[49:36.03]No, it's too big.
[49:36.61]We need to be able to see this shit.
[49:39.53]Should I shoot it with a bow and arrow?
[49:42.83]Like a wooden staff maybe?
[49:43.97]Alright, we got the game saved.
[49:46.59]Alright, that's good.
[49:47.74]Okay, here we go.
[49:49.32]We're going to turn the AI back on and we're going to see what happens here.
[49:57.38]AI enable.
[49:58.68]Save game.
[50:00.58]AI enable.
[50:05.64]Did that do anything?
[50:10.17]AI underscore enabled.
[50:15.53]Unknown command.
[50:22.67]I'll just do AI disabled.
[50:23.93]Okay, here we go.
[50:34.39]Come on!
[50:47.26]Who's coughing?
[50:48.76]Somebody's coughing.
[50:51.08]Somebody just was like... We can do it one more time.
[50:55.32]One more time.
[51:24.61]It was just like fucking white noise on a TV.
[51:28.99]Jesus Christ.
[51:29.93]Alright, one more thing I want to do.
[51:37.10]Let's just see what happens if they are left to their own volition.
[51:44.40]Human, a human!
[51:45.52]Oh my god, a human!
[51:47.90]There's a fucking human over here!
[51:49.92]Somebody get him!
[51:51.54]Oh, I got stabbed in the back by my best friend!
[52:02.40]Okay, let's fucking play the game.
[52:05.00]Let's go back and play the game.
[52:06.64]We're done.
[52:07.38]We did it.
[52:07.84]We did what we wanted to do.
[52:10.78]Let's go.
[52:11.40]No clip, no more.
[52:13.06]We gotta get away from that.
[52:16.78]Okay, back to reality.
[52:24.69]Now we're back to reality.
[52:25.83]He'll never be the same.
[52:26.73]Oh, G is still bound.
[52:33.13]Hey, well, you never know when you're gonna need an orc, so it's okay.
[52:37.79]I'm okay with it being bound still.
[52:40.00]Or am I?
[52:46.92]I might not be okay with this.
[52:48.98]I made the game harder on myself.
[52:57.28]Get out of here.
[53:11.03]We're gonna hit the orcs again.
[53:18.86]Okay.
[53:20.98]Yeah, you never know when you're gonna need an orc.
[53:23.50]So, I'm okay with that.
[53:28.21]Ring of the Phoenix.
[53:28.87]I cannot even pick it up.
[53:31.99]I have a full battery.
[53:33.61]Full battery.
[53:36.51]I hit shit from it.
[53:37.35]Easy.
[53:37.71]Okay, um, what about these, like, scrolls?
[53:39.46]I have so many.
[53:40.00]Wizard Robe.
[53:40.82]What do I have on?
[53:41.68]A Wizard Robe.
[53:42.42]Get this out of here.
[53:42.94]I don't need another one.
[53:47.48]Uh, 10 mana...
[53:50.65]Get rid of the longsword, I don't need that.
[53:52.21]I just shattered a bunch of shit.
[53:54.21]God damn it, I just broke all those bottles.
[54:01.16]Wooden staff.
[54:02.82]Get this out of here.
[54:04.76]This stupid dragonfly book.
[54:14.42]It's Darth Maul.
[54:17.06]I don't know man, Darth Maul kind of sucks.
[54:19.86]Darth Maul is not that great.
[54:23.46]Let's do it again.
[54:29.62]Just fucking fly off and scream like you guys do.
[54:35.98]It's so funny how the kick really is like the best thing.
[54:39.20]Let's freeze myself.
[54:55.07]I thought I just... Okay, that guy got cut by something.
[55:00.67]God damn it.
[55:06.35]Where's my... Where's my armor?
[55:08.75]Where's my fucking armor?
[55:09.63]Where is it?
[55:17.60]Ring of the Phoenix.
[55:20.62]Put this on to regen some health.
[55:24.41]Ring of Might.
[55:25.05]I don't want this.
[55:26.99]Ring of Arcane Brilliance.
[55:28.15]Ring of the Phoenix.
[55:28.65]Once your health reaches zero, the ring prevents you from dying and restores your health.
[55:31.91]Then the ring breaks.
[55:33.45]So it's just the Dark Souls ring.
[55:38.62]Alright, cool.
[55:40.62]It's just the Dark Souls ring.
[55:43.86]I guess I'll use that with a boss or something.
[55:49.07]Endless Quiver.
[55:49.83]Do I even need half of this shit?
[55:51.45]I don't even know what I do need.
[55:52.43]Get this node out of here.
[55:56.18]This sword is cool, but... I kind of feel like... Look at all these bows!
[56:03.46]Out of my way.
[56:06.50]Superior skill sword.
[56:07.88]Okay.
[56:08.78]Plus three adds 2%.
[56:10.73]Plus six adds 4%.
[56:12.49]So why do I have this?
[56:16.43]It's the Ring of Sacrifice.
[56:17.55]That's what it is.
[56:20.59]Thank you, Han, for the bits.
[56:22.39]Also, moist...
[56:23.62]Thank you, Moist, for the $5.
[56:24.60]I like crawling on your face while you sleep.
[56:26.92]His name is Moist Tarantula.
[56:29.76]That's a creepy name.
[56:30.50]Alright, let's go.
[56:35.28]Where do I go?
[56:35.64]There's a... Save it.
[56:40.98]Ah!
[56:46.44]What's up there?
[56:47.22]Who knows?
[56:49.07]Back to the reality of raw garlic.
[56:51.51]I love garlic.
[56:54.03]Is there gonna be vampires and shit that I have to deal with?
[56:57.15]I just knocked something off the table like a fucking idiot.
[56:59.35]I don't even know what it was.
[57:00.47]What was that?
[57:00.91]I don't even know where it went.
[57:03.52]I have to reload the game.
[57:07.98]You guys don't like raw garlic?
[57:12.22]Garlic is fucking delicious.
[57:15.42]You forgot the pubes.
[57:16.75]Yeah, you know, I did.
[57:17.73]I did forget the fact that your name has pubes in it.
[57:21.51]Well, I guess I didn't now.
[57:27.46]I just knocked it off again.
[57:28.86]I fucking knocked it off.
[57:31.30]Where did it go?
[57:31.88]I don't know.
[57:37.06]It just turned my head to the side and it fell off the table.
[57:47.78]Okay.
[57:49.73]Easy.
[57:50.59]It's so bright.
[57:51.49]Wizard robe.
[57:52.27]That's what it was.
[57:55.24]Cool.
[57:55.52]There's a fucking wizard rope.
[57:58.18]I'm glad that I picked that up.
[58:01.12]It's the exact same thing I have already.
[58:02.86]Wait a minute!
[58:05.18]Wait a minute.
[58:05.71]What is happening right now?
[58:06.93]Why did I... Where's the other wizard rope?
[58:13.69]Have I lost my mind?
[58:22.93]What is this?
[58:23.81]I can break this.
[58:27.03]What is this opening?
[58:31.22]Probably.
[58:31.72]Yes, probably.
[58:32.48]Probably.
[58:38.18]I guess I go down here?
[58:39.90]No?
[58:41.19]I hear like a wailing.
[58:42.11]There's a fucking whale in here.
[58:57.49]Jump out the window?
[59:02.61]How do I open this?
[59:03.75]Telekinesis?
[59:04.37]Let's drop an orc stack in here.
[59:20.84]Can I not cut the rope?
[59:21.96]Why can I not cut this rope?
[59:24.66]I feel like that's what I need to do.
[59:33.76]Is there, like, a door or something?
[59:38.11]Oh, wait.
[59:38.41]I can go up.
[59:38.87]Okay, I guess we're going up here.
[59:44.81]To find the whale.
[59:53.87]If you hadn't cut the rope, it wouldn't be impossible to cut the rope.
[59:56.45]Wait, what are you talking about?
[59:59.21]Ugh.
[60:00.17]It smells like rotting meat in here.
[60:02.99]It's cause there is rotting meat.
[60:04.25]Uh-oh, more spiders, more poison bullshit.
[60:07.93]And as I say it, as I say it, it happens, you know?
[60:14.56]It's so dark in here.
[60:15.40]I feel like I'm playing Virtual Boy.
[60:18.10]If the fucking Virtual Boy was blue instead of red.
[60:21.55]Where is it?
[60:21.97]Where's my fucking antidotes?
[60:24.21]And I... No!
[60:28.03]No!
[60:34.81]God damn it.
[60:39.35]I'm running by the spiders.
[60:41.21]They're the worst.
[60:49.47]What is this?
[60:49.89]Antidote?
[60:50.39]Health potion?
[60:53.40]There's no reason to fight any of these.
[60:54.88]Just keep going.
[60:55.40]I tried to kick it as a joke and it was not a funny joke and it was stupid.
[61:02.96]Yeah, why even fight?
[61:10.13]Hello?
[61:12.67]Are there any bosses in this game?
[61:16.04]I feel like I should have seen one.
[61:23.34]And now the whole building is collapsing.
[61:43.45]Alright, well... Just give me the stuff!
[61:47.01]What the fuck?!
[61:59.06]Do I have to, like, crouch and not... How do I telekinesis this shit?
[62:16.90]No clip.
[62:20.70]Telekinesis.
[62:25.60]Let's just slowly be very careful.
[62:29.81]Let's get some weight out of here.
[62:37.09]What is that?
[62:37.79]Ooh.
[62:40.95]Get some more weight out of here.
[62:45.00]Out the window.
[62:45.44]Shit!
[62:48.02]Shit!
[62:55.50]Bring me this chest.
[63:08.45]Come on, open it from here!
[63:10.89]Use your Oogie Boogie powers and get this thing open!
[63:14.14]I'm going for it.
[63:14.61]Ready?
[63:14.89]Save.
[63:18.31]Dang it!
[63:22.87]I'll get it.
[63:27.48]Wait a minute.
[63:28.86]Wait a minute.
[63:30.70]Wait a minute.
[63:44.63]What did I just do?
[63:51.45]Come on.
[63:52.07]I can't, like, rope over there.
[63:53.17]I can't pull it towards me.
[63:55.98]I can pull that towards me, though.
[64:02.78]There we go.
[64:03.28]I'm just gonna stand.
[64:08.71]Get over here.
[64:10.17]Take it.
[64:10.79]Take it.
[64:11.05]There's so much stuff I can take.
[64:16.39]That it?
[64:17.39]Save it.
[64:21.05]What?
[64:22.58]What hit me?
[64:28.16]What even hit me?
[64:28.94]That didn't make any sense.
[64:29.70]I got fucking knocked out.
[64:32.12]I'm having a fucking temper tantrum.
[64:39.17]Everything's out.
[64:39.69]It's gone.
[65:13.19]Good luck, guys.
[65:15.22]No, wait a second.
[65:19.18]It's like barely teetering.
[65:20.60]Alright.
[65:31.57]So how much weight can this handle?
[65:35.09]They go through.
[65:35.73]Oh, God.
[65:36.88]Those guys are just going to.
[65:39.58]OK.
[65:43.21]Oh, I wanted to see this from far away.
[65:44.63]That's unfortunate.
[65:54.26]Here we go.
[65:57.42]They're gonna just trash this place.
[66:05.46]Is it gonna fall?
[66:07.57]Somebody has to move.
[66:11.72]So wait, when they move it doesn't matter, but when I move it does.
[66:19.10]That guy's moving around!
[66:19.91]How have these guys not fallen by the way?
[66:23.09]The guy's underneath.
[66:26.71]I have to touch it.
[66:30.75]That guy tripped.
[66:32.87]Hold on.
[66:39.81]Why won't this work?
[66:45.72]There's something else in there.
[66:47.28]What else is in there?
[66:47.92]Scroll of Fireball, got it.
[66:51.63]Alright, well, I... I gotta hit the building.
[67:04.51]This is very loud.
[67:11.51]They're all like, no, no, no!
[67:13.23]Don't do it!
[67:14.11]You psycho!
[67:22.50]So I have to not be no-clipping in here?
[67:25.82]How am I fucking gonna do this?
[67:34.90]Here we go.
[67:35.54]I'm gonna be not no-clipping on the roof.
[67:39.02]Alright, this is better.
[67:43.92]Now it's gonna break, right?
[67:47.56]Alright, here we go.
[67:52.66]Break it!
[67:56.82]God damn it!
[67:58.10]Damn it!
[67:59.12]Damn it!
[68:02.46]God damn it!
[68:05.43]Fucking... Nice tea kettle scream.
[68:13.27]What a fucking waste of time.
[68:21.17]Wait, how did you get no clip?
[68:28.62]Let's go.
[68:29.18]I'm fucking out.
[68:29.96]We're done.
[68:32.52]Go.
[68:34.01]We're done with that.
[68:35.23]We're done with this.
[68:36.47]We're going.
[68:37.43]It's over.
[68:39.51]I tried.
[68:40.69]And it failed.
[68:41.73]So, it's okay.
[68:44.01]Where's my staff?
[68:48.40]Bind the noclip key so you can turn it off and on fast.
[68:50.90]That's, you know, I'm gonna do that.
[68:57.00]Bind, like, T to noclip.
[69:05.48]That's the spider from before.
[69:06.65]Alright, so, where was I even going before this all happened?
[69:09.71]I don't remember.
[69:10.27]Did I even come over here?
[69:14.03]I don't fucking even know where I am right now.
[69:16.09]Okay, I haven't been in here.
[69:19.91]There's a drawbridge to there.
[69:24.41]That's like a secret area.
[69:25.51]I don't care about this holy book.
[69:31.46]The scroll.
[69:32.16]I don't care about the scroll.
[69:33.88]I don't want the scroll.
[69:36.32]That doesn't bother me.
[69:37.74]No.
[69:40.30]I was already here.
[69:47.12]So we gotta go this way.
[69:52.69]Go read the Bible.
[69:54.33]It's okay.
[69:54.91]I don't need to read the Bible right now.
[69:59.54]It's still in one piece.
[70:01.96]Do you think the orcs have been keeping it up?
[70:04.52]Orcs aren't stupid.
[70:06.06]Give it a try.
[70:08.22]That was me talking?
[70:09.47]My main character hasn't said a word in a long time.
[70:11.55]Okay.
[70:18.01]Keep going.
[70:26.68]Oh, there's this again.
[70:27.70]I don't think I can do anything with it, though.
[70:33.30]Tools for making a sword hilt.
[70:34.65]Yeah, I mean, I already did this shit.
[70:38.35]Oh, wait, I just put... Did I just put materials in there?
[70:41.95]Oh, shit.
[70:44.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[70:45.29]What is this?
[70:51.00]Now I gotta... What am I doing here?
[70:52.96]What's in here?
[70:53.36]What is this?
[70:57.53]The gold bar is not in there.
[71:01.33]How do I put the gold bar in there?
[71:02.43]I thought it was going to automatically put it in.
[71:03.93]Okay, there we go.
[71:09.47]Oh, dude, a gold sword?
[71:13.18]A golden sword?
[71:14.26]Whoa!
[71:20.72]Whoa!
[71:28.75]Holy shit!
[71:36.02]I need to like cool it off or something, right?
[71:38.14]What happened?
[71:42.90]Why can I not pick this up?
[71:45.02]Do I need like tongs?
[71:55.49]Got it.
[72:02.05]Get it all heated up.
[72:03.31]Pick out the hammer.
[72:03.93]Where's the hammer?
[72:11.93]Where is the hammer?
[72:17.39]Where's the fucking hammer?
[72:18.75]I picked it up.
[72:19.75]Where did it go?
[72:26.87]Am I blind right now?
[72:28.67]Jesus.
[72:31.34]Take a fucking potion.
[72:32.16]Alright.
[72:36.90]So now... Earthfire Sword.
[72:44.41]Holy shit.
[72:47.65]What is this?
[72:51.15]Earthfire Sword.
[72:54.59]I can't use it unless I have Strength 2.
[73:00.99]That's fucking kinda cool.
[73:03.41]Plus 6, I mean, is that really even better?
[73:06.50]This is plus 6, plus 12, plus 3, plus 6, it is.
[73:10.24]I need 2 into strength.
[73:16.96]I kinda need to use this sword.
[73:18.73]We're going for it.
[73:19.33]Let me see, I got like new skills here though.
[73:25.67]Disarm an enemy.
[73:28.95]I can now use a shield and then break parry.
[73:32.75]Enables flurry of blows to sometimes break enemy parries.
[73:36.14]Powerful strike that will knock the enemy off balance.
[73:38.02]Jump and power strike.
[73:39.20]And then a whirlwind attack.
[73:42.98]Crouch and then power strike adrenaline rush.
[73:47.29]And then I need two into here.
[73:49.45]Okay.
[73:53.33]Cool.
[73:54.89]All righty.
[73:57.27]Let's temporarily still use the staff, because it's the currently best thing I have right now, I think.
[74:03.99]And away we go.
[74:05.53]Well, that's a neat little feature.
[74:06.80]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[74:08.58]What's that?
[74:10.82]Didn't I pick up some armor or something?
[74:12.36]I did.
[74:14.54]Plate armor.
[74:15.20]I don't have endurance 2.
[74:17.62]Will I have endurance 2?
[74:19.31]Like, probably not right away.
[74:26.86]Wasted points?
[74:27.44]What are you talking about?
[74:28.60]Wait, what are you talking about?
[74:29.46]Wasted points.
[74:33.54]How is that wasted points?
[74:34.74]What are you talking about?
[74:38.45]Don't I have to get down to here?
[74:43.15]You have to max melee out to get down to strength, don't you?
[74:47.27]Sharpen the blade.
[74:54.26]How do I sharpen the blade?
[74:57.15]Is it like a sharpening stone?
[75:06.10]Am I just being lied to?
[75:10.56]Sharpen the blade.
[75:13.94]You can't, like... Cut it out.
[75:17.06]Cut it out.
[75:17.42]I'm very fragile.
[75:18.48]Cut it out.
[75:25.15]Chat lies.
[75:27.90]Yeah, do you think?
[75:30.96]So I gotta go back out here.
[75:32.70]Do I have to go back out here, or is there another door I could go in?
[75:36.74]Where's G to sharpen the blade?
[75:39.58]That would be funny if it were real.
[75:41.66]No other doors or anything.
[75:42.69]I just have to go back.
[75:43.27]The lift is not moving.
[75:44.35]Mm-hmm.
[75:53.25]What is that?
[75:56.29]He didn't polish the sword.
[75:58.02]Give me a break!
[76:00.72]Not this time!
[76:01.48]Fucking respect this guy.
[76:08.28]I would have laughed if he just screamed.
[76:11.35]Where's this lift?
[76:13.53]Apparently I just did.
[76:15.25]What did I just do?
[76:18.25]Take the stairs back to the elevator to access the crystal chamber.
[76:24.96]I mean, where was that?
[76:25.82]Was that all the way back here?
[76:31.59]Am I like just going the wrong way?
[76:38.75]I might be.
[76:43.00]I probably am just going the complete opposite direction of what I need to do.
[76:46.94]Wasn't it before the bridge?
[77:01.92]Wrong way.
[77:02.38]That gives me a headache.
[77:20.14]It gets funnier every time.
[77:33.14]This game gives me a headache.
[77:34.38]Alright, it was over, like, where?
[77:39.84]Here?
[77:40.18]I don't remember.
[77:44.78]The battering ram.
[77:49.30]We're done, guys.
[77:50.56]Well, we were until I decided we weren't.
[77:56.30]Do I need a quest marker?
[77:57.44]Not really.
[77:59.85]I just kind of need to remember where it was.
[78:04.33]There it is.
[78:08.11]Alright, let's like do this.
[78:10.89]I don't know how many times I have to do this.
[78:16.47]Battering Raymond?
[78:17.61]Come on, you.
[78:21.07]Nice job.
[78:21.81]Alright, now get out of the way.
[78:26.34]What is this?
[78:26.96]What's going on with my screen right now?
[78:28.74]I would love to know why this was happening.
[78:31.22]What is going on?
[78:32.14]I'd rather do this mode.
[78:34.40]I'd rather be in virtual boy mode.
[78:36.08]Like, what the fuck?
[78:38.18]Stop it.
[78:39.10]Cut this shit.
[78:39.92]What is making this light?
[78:43.58]Oh my god.
[78:44.46]Can I just get whatever's in here and leave?
[78:54.33]What's in here?
[78:54.79]Just give it to me.
[78:56.69]Is lightning daggers in here?
[78:58.49]Lightning daggers and a mana potion.
[78:59.67]Alright, now get me the fuck out of here.
[79:02.56]Get me out.
[79:04.52]That's it.
[79:04.94]Get me out.
[79:05.34]I got lightning daggers.
[79:06.56]Goodbye.
[79:11.11]Thank god.
[79:11.81]Holy shit.
[79:13.53]It's not stopping.
[79:16.27]What happened to this game?
[79:17.95]There's like a fucking empty coke bottle over here.
[79:19.51]What do I do?
[79:20.37]How do I get this to stop happening?
[79:25.89]Jesus.
[79:28.50]Where did they go?
[79:29.22]I picked them up.
[79:33.65]Did I pick it up?
[79:34.15]What was it?
[79:36.11]Gutting Chris.
[79:37.51]Poison Chris.
[79:41.05]Chris.
[79:45.51]They're on, they're equipped.
[79:47.35]Plus four, plus eight.
[79:48.39]These are better than what I have.
[79:50.49]Ooh.
[79:55.70]That's pretty nice actually.
[79:56.62]I'm gonna try these for a while, even though I don't like the way they make my hands look.
[80:02.11]Alright, let's go.
[80:03.63]I feel like that was a Dark Souls secret that I missed.
[80:06.79]Hey, thank you, The Moral, for the 20 bucks.
[80:08.91]I just want to say I agree with those guys who said you should play Phoenix Wright.
[80:12.81]Phoenix Wright is an interesting game.
[80:14.47]Although, isn't it only on DS?
[80:28.60]I mean, wouldn't I have to capture a DS?
[80:30.04]Isn't that, like, not possible?
[80:31.30]They're shamans?
[80:31.90]Most goddamn spiders that you fill me with this shit.
[81:05.35]Get away from me.
[81:06.30]Burn.
[81:08.54]Jesus.
[81:09.02]Alright.
[81:12.94]So now I gotta, like, put the crystal back on the crystal skull thing?
[81:15.76]I don't know what it is with these textures, man, but I might need to- I didn't think I might need to reload the game.
[81:34.21]I might have to reload the game.
[81:37.09]What's dead?
[81:37.87]Bring what back to life?
[81:39.25]This thing?
[81:39.99]Oh, that is the crystal.
[81:43.53]Okay, well, hold on.
[81:45.69]This opened.
[81:46.12]How do I turn this on?
[82:08.39]There's like a bridge I have to activate?
[82:09.87]What's going on here?
[82:12.05]There we are.
[82:12.65]Okay, here we go.
[82:15.67]Put the crystal back where it belongs.
[82:18.69]Get the cutscene.
[82:20.41]I just got sucked in.
[82:25.53]I just got sucked down into the vortex.
[82:28.67]I moved to the left and it magnetized me into the pit.
[82:35.75]So let me move out of the way.
[82:37.87]Now let's not keep that child waiting.
[82:40.55]The sooner she gets us to the skull, the better.
[82:44.17]Okay.
[82:44.81]Good.
[82:45.18]Get away from here!
[82:46.14]It'll kill us!
[82:50.30]Uh-oh.
[82:51.02]Uh-oh!
[82:57.25]Here comes the last boss.
[82:59.27]Stranger.
[83:00.65]Demon's party.

[83:05.47]So this is like the main orc

[83:45.77]I can't kick him into the pit.
[83:48.45]What the fuck?
[83:50.73]Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on here?
[83:52.07]I picked up a rock and they all freaked out.
[83:53.67]What?
[83:56.71]No magic is allowed?
[83:58.21]Well, that's horseshit.
[84:03.81]Now he's not even talking.
[84:06.85]Did he not listen?
[84:07.45]Well, I don't listen to the rules.
[84:09.05]I'm like a magician.
[84:10.13]For the love of Urgash, Sarrath, don't worry about the others.
[84:14.62]Okay, alright, let's lightning bolt this guy.
[84:18.10]What the?
[84:18.52]Wait, why?
[84:19.24]What the fuck?
[84:22.00]I can't even have lightning weapons?
[84:23.44]I can't have magic weapons.
[84:24.60]Alright, well then fuck you all!
[84:27.98]I'll beat you the old-fashioned way.
[84:29.52]You lose.
[84:30.22]God damn it.
[84:31.48]Hold on.
[84:47.57]I can't- This is fucking so stupid.
[84:52.89]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[84:58.56]Where's like five- do I have-
[85:11.50]I can't fucking move.
[85:12.46]I'm locked in here.
[85:13.36]But thankfully, like, so is he.
[85:15.53]I don't even know what the fuck happened.
[85:28.90]Apparently I don't fight with honor.
[85:45.46]I can't even see in there.
[85:46.92]Get the fuck over here.
[85:47.88]It's that guy.
[85:53.96]And then this is the last guy.
[86:04.45]Got him.
[86:05.67]Okay.
[86:06.35]Well, that was... These things are a little annoying, actually.
[86:09.37]They, like, hurt my face.
[86:13.15]They're too bright.
[86:13.77]I should have just pickaxed them.
[86:21.22]I don't have any honor.
[86:22.14]No, I don't.
[86:23.90]Not when the game tells me I can't use magic.
[86:26.80]But then... Like, I don't even use magic and it doesn't matter.
[86:31.95]No, I was going to get out of here, right?
[86:37.69]Spider key, there it is.
[86:40.49]I'm gonna fucking drag the orc leader around.
[86:46.61]And just humiliate the whole troop.
[86:55.03]Like, this is your leader.
[86:57.11]And I... Germany 9-8 Furmity.
[87:02.38]Took him down with a single blow.
[87:06.68]Oh, god damn, come on.
[87:14.92]Alright.

[87:49.67]Do any of you guys have this game?
[87:51.87]Because there's a multiplayer.
[87:52.87]Does it actually still work?
[87:54.57]I would love to try it.
[87:55.73]The one who guides your crossing in the underworld?
[87:59.00]What?
[87:59.94]This isn't Dante's Inferno, man.
[88:03.20]Oh, the seventh dragon.
[88:15.89]Main hall.
[88:16.41]Alright, I gotta remember where that is.
[88:19.43]Back this way, right?
[88:22.11]Uh, that's where I crushed the guy.
[88:23.30]Is it?
[88:23.58]No.
[88:24.18]I don't remember.
[88:24.66]No, I think it... I think it is back this way.
[88:30.00]And then... Out here?
[88:32.48]If I remember... Yes.
[88:35.96]Alright, lady.
[88:38.86]Objective ready!

[88:46.45]What did you do to me?
[88:47.75]What happened to me?
[89:11.41]Did I, like, step in a crack?
[89:13.71]Oh, I fell down here.
[89:17.39]Whoa, don't do it again.
[89:18.55]Let me help you.

[89:45.18]Why are they here?
[89:47.20]Why are they here?
[89:47.78]I was making a fucking magic joke.
[89:51.72]It doesn't make any sense.
[90:02.37]Was that supposed to happen?
[90:10.96]I got an idea.
[90:14.48]Now I got a minion.
[90:18.68]That's how easily you lose to these little fucking Grendels?
[90:22.41]These little fucking golems?
[90:29.60]Why are these guys so hard to kill?
[90:31.24]Alright, we're gonna have to fucking toothpaste.

[91:20.98]Is this shit supposed to be happening right now?
[91:22.46]I just skimmed it on him.
[91:28.09]These guys are so much more dangerous than the Orc captain.
[91:43.15]Can she open the door?
[91:44.41]Die!
[91:51.07]Finally.
[91:51.47]Holy shit.

[92:40.05]You're going to actually kill me?
[92:46.70]Oh, wait a minute.
[92:53.57]I just got called an idiot.
[92:57.39]You idiot.

[93:15.33]It auto-saved.
[93:17.09]It auto-saved right here.
[93:19.21]I have to do a manual save.
[93:24.26]Okay, well thank God I have it saved right here.
[93:32.04]See, now we're safe.
[93:35.68]Close it.

[94:56.78]She's playing dead.
[95:04.94]Um, alright.
[95:08.74]Can you get up?
[95:13.25]I don't think she's gonna get up.
[95:18.13]Okay.
[95:19.07]Uh, well, we're gonna reload this because I don't want to, like, fuck up the rest of the game.
[95:27.23]Because you know that, like, it's gonna break something.
[95:36.39]Oh, okay.
[95:40.53]Run, run, run.

[100:47.51]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[100:50.07]Let's get him down.
[101:16.17]the game crashed oh for the love of fuck the game crashed on the fucking naked scene get off the screen get off the screen crashed on nudity
[101:46.25]It's gonna be loud.
[101:48.03]Ahhhh.
[101:48.68]Every fucking game.
[101:57.24]Game knows I cheated.
[101:58.33]We're gonna do it legit.
[102:16.82]I want to.
[102:33.06]I don't want to.
[102:36.44]I don't want to do it, Bob.
[102:38.80]We already know the plot twist.
[102:40.32]The Lich King is in the game.
[102:41.56]That's the plot twist.
[102:48.62]I can't pick this shit up.
[102:50.54]What am I... I'm poisoned.
[102:56.48]It's so dark.
[102:57.18]I don't like this level at all.
[103:03.27]I don't like this.
[103:04.53]I don't like this.
[103:06.59]Okay.
[103:11.87]We're gonna just complete it.
[103:13.05]We're gonna do it the way that we're supposed to.
[103:14.35]Let's just do it the way we're supposed to do it.
[103:19.23]Whichever way that is.
[103:19.95]There's so many of them.
[103:30.26]Can these guys trip?
[103:35.74]Of course they can.
[103:36.60]Everybody can trip.
[103:37.42]At least do the barrier skip.
[103:55.06]That's not gonna drop the ceiling, is it?
[103:56.18]Of course it's gonna drop the fucking ceiling.
[104:02.97]That's gonna fall down and hit me.
[104:12.57]We are gonna be, like, underleveled if we don't do this correctly.
[104:15.25]He's dead.
[104:22.57]Six strats.
[104:24.99]Shit.
[104:27.48]No, not... Oh.
[104:34.82]I... Why am I so weak?
[104:40.10]I don't know.
[104:40.58]I shouldn't be.
[104:42.12]By the way, all the orcs that I killed earlier, when they drop them off the bridge and shit, is that added to my total...
[104:52.34]Oh my fucking god.
[104:53.63]I have full health.
[104:56.21]I think I broke the game.
[105:02.39]I think I have.
[105:03.23]I think I fucked up the game.
[105:08.74]I was actually very much alive there.
[105:10.94]I have a very bad build.
[105:21.58]Well, let's do it.
[105:23.12]Let's put it in.
[105:26.52]Strength and endurance.
[105:28.32]There's endurance.
[105:31.54]Press G to fix the game.
[105:36.18]Just use G as my special skill to summon an orc.
[105:39.52]Well, now I know what I'm gonna do.
[105:40.59]I'm gonna drag them all out here.
[105:41.65]There's a bunch of random people.
[105:45.37]Just wait till they crawl out of the fucking ground and then drop the whole thing on everybody.
[105:52.02]Yeah, now it's a good build.
[105:57.22]Really?
[105:57.54]They fucking have acid breath.
[105:58.62]Alright, come on a little closer, a little closer.
[106:01.76]No, you did it to yourselves!
[106:04.36]You idiot!
[106:05.69]Oh my god, I didn't even kill him.
[106:16.19]Does my character just suck?
[106:18.05]Is that my issue?
[106:23.71]Does this work on him?
[106:26.67]It does, okay.
[106:41.66]Finally, only one guy left.
[106:49.78]Stop healing during poison?
[106:51.02]It doesn't go away?
[106:51.60]Well, won't it just kill me?
[107:05.68]Okay.
[107:10.38]You need to have a focused build.
[107:12.70]Well, it's alright.
[107:13.30]We don't have... What the hell did I just do?
[107:18.20]I just, like, threw that at him?
[107:19.99]What the fuck is happening?
[107:20.95]He's dead.
[107:21.57]I don't even know what I did.
[107:25.71]How do I open this shit?
[107:26.67]Do I have to use the rope bow?
[107:27.73]And I climb up there?
[107:34.72]Maybe.
[107:37.08]Can't tell if it's wood or not.
[107:41.95]I guess I can go up here.
[107:51.86]Hey, I... There really was right there, huh?
[107:55.74]I really was, like, right available to do that, huh?
[107:57.74]Okay.
[108:00.68]Alright, here we go.
[108:01.20]Go play Roblox.
[108:01.80]Three hours, guys.
[108:02.88]Three hours, they say.
[108:04.20]That was like 30 minutes.
[108:04.98]Because I couldn't kill anything.
[108:06.31]Three hours.
[108:06.75]Mm-hmm.
[108:32.01]Watch this be just like a dumb puzzle and it... I need two endurance for this.
[108:43.45]Okay.
[108:47.45]So should I just drop down?
[108:48.49]Isn't that just where it was?
[108:56.87]What about... No, I came up that way.
[108:59.76]I mean, can I...
[109:05.28]I just, like, I just wish it wasn't so fucking dark.
[109:08.63]Like, let me be real.
[109:09.51]Let me give you, like, a real I wish, like, I wish scenario.
[109:13.45]I wish it wasn't just perma-black so I could see anything.
[109:22.53]It's, everything just melds together when it's all, like, a dark fucking green.
[109:25.83]Oh my god fucking damn it.
[109:31.14]UGHHH
[109:32.94]This whole fucking game has to be like a dark green.
[109:35.47]Oh, shut up.
[109:36.97]Is that my wish?
[109:37.61]Can I like drop down here?
[109:38.59]I must have to drop down here and like climb over or something.
[110:02.44]Now, you know, I ain't got no- I'm about to fucking walk through that door in Oak Cliff.
[110:08.65]This is like hurting my head.
[110:12.91]Every time I turn on the Virtual Boy mode, I want to quit the game.
[110:15.31]I mean, like, can I just sneak on something?
[110:28.82]Do I have to climb on these?
[110:33.65]Give in to your anger.
[110:40.93]There are fences?
[110:41.89]I mean, I gotta... I gotta, like, just take a second and look.
[110:49.09]Let me, like, come back down here.
[110:54.29]There's that.
[110:55.53]That needs to be, like, opened or something.
[110:57.23]What's back here?
[111:00.98]No, just no clip through it.
[111:19.53]What is this?
[111:21.33]What is this fucking nonsense?
[111:24.43]No, that's just like a fucking sarcophagus.
[111:31.13]It has to be up here.
[111:36.58]This dumb lady was like, I wonder where it is.
[111:39.28]Do you have any ideas?
[111:41.02]Or maybe it's over on the other side.
[111:53.18]I know it's here.
[111:55.54]I would love to know.
[112:00.86]What if I like step on this?
[112:09.16]Watch this be a dumb puzzle.
[112:10.33]And watch it be like I should have just walked through the fucking door.
[112:14.39]This doesn't open.
[112:19.49]Is there anything, like, in the walls?
[112:21.41]No.
[112:22.67]That just leads me back down.
[112:28.31]Uh... Kind of, uh... Kind of done with this room.
[112:35.53]The only thing I can think of is getting up there.
[112:43.05]This is the only thing I can think of.
[112:44.33]I guess this is what I have to do.
[112:51.14]And pick up the... the Soul Drinker.
[112:56.72]What the hell is that?
[113:03.06]It was just a secret area.
[113:07.38]Well... I got the secret sword.
[113:11.23]That's cool, I guess.
[113:19.51]Anything else?
[113:23.76]No.
[113:26.62]So then I have to go back down.
[113:27.58]I hope this doesn't kill me.
[113:33.22]It almost did.
[113:37.18]I love how the secret's easier to figure out than the actual game.
[113:44.14]I would say that's particularly true.
[113:52.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait, hey!
[113:59.09]Is this it?
[114:02.67]It's not it.
[114:09.11]What the fuck is this?
[114:15.53]Can I, like, move this shit?
[114:17.51]What hit me?
[114:17.99]What if I crouch?
[114:22.48]I can't do anything with this.
[114:30.37]Alright, uh... Where else do I have to go?
[114:37.68]A dagger.
[114:38.22]Entered upon his glorious return, his heart was ever faithful to the seventh dragon.
[114:45.54]I spit on the memory of the seventh dragon.
[114:47.60]So should you, Sarath, considering what he did to your family.
[114:51.06]The giant glowing gem?
[114:53.03]Wait, where was there a giant glowing gem?
[114:57.17]This thing?
[114:59.29]What is this?
[115:09.90]That's a fucking light.
[115:11.76]That's a light like one of these things.
[115:14.60]Can I take those off too?
[115:17.22]That was literally just a light on the wall.
[115:19.41]There's been no indication that I could ever pick up a fucking light on the wall.
[115:25.29]What in the name of wild fucking wild world of sports are we talking about here, guys?
[115:31.19]There's a legit lamp on the wall.
[115:36.83]What about with this one?
[115:37.51]Can I take this one?
[115:38.39]Nope, nope.
[115:39.07]I can't.
[115:39.37]Okay, here we go.
[115:43.87]Stick it in there.
[115:46.73]Got a skill point.
[115:49.33]Ooh, sweet!
[115:51.07]Oh, don't shoot me!
[115:54.67]Fucking yellow belt.
[115:55.39]Fucking yellow belt.
[115:56.11]Fucking yellow belt.
[115:56.66]Oh my god.
[116:01.24]Fucking yellow belt.
[116:01.98]Fucking yellow belt.
[116:02.76]Fucking yellow belt.
[116:04.10]Somebody yellow belt.
[116:10.30]Where the hell am I going?
[116:17.09]Secret!
[116:25.91]Magic mushroom!
[116:29.89]Secret!
[116:32.64]Press like the weird little secret porn stashes!
[116:35.04]Did I actually hit that guy in the head?
[116:42.26]Okay, let's keep going around.
[116:43.74]Two skill points.
[116:44.52]Can I do anything with it?
[116:46.72]I need six to do one in strength.
[116:50.77]I need seven to do one here.
[116:53.83]Okay, well I...
[116:57.74]No, we're gonna try to stay down here to strength, because I want to put on that fire sword.
[117:01.08]I feel like that's gonna do me a lot of favors.
[117:07.20]What's that?
[117:07.72]Can I cut this?
[117:09.18]I can.
[117:10.82]Can I do a giant hammer?
[117:14.12]I gotta keep that in mind.
[117:15.66]How do I get down from here?
[117:16.76]Is this gonna hurt me?
[117:23.38]No.
[117:23.68]Okay.
[117:23.80]Okay.
[117:28.06]I can grab this.
[117:30.12]But why?
[117:30.90]What does that do?
[117:32.84]Giant, like, weird guillotine.
[117:34.08]Hmm.
[117:38.18]Okay.
[117:40.86]This is the bottom of this.
[117:41.92]Okay, let me just get on a ground level so I can just take a better look.
[117:50.81]Okay, this needs to be broken, obviously.
[118:00.33]I had a chance to break it, I just didn't know I could.
[118:02.07]Well, let's just do this then.
[118:10.77]There it is.
[118:12.01]Smash it!
[118:13.43]Smashed.
[118:13.99]Completed.
[118:14.89]Very loud smash.
[118:16.56]What?
[118:16.74]Somebody has dogs in here?
[118:18.30]It's in here, right?
[118:19.48]In the sarcophagus?
[118:35.39]Whoa!
[118:38.67]Easy.
[118:38.93]Did you see that, like, fucking dumb jump?
[118:51.81]Like, I'm gonna, like, there's too much pee in my bloodstream right now.
[118:55.05]Give me a second.
[118:56.69]I need to, like, pee.
[118:59.04]I haven't taken a break yet.
[118:59.96]It's been, like, two hours.
[119:00.78]I gotta fucking take a pee break.
[119:02.66]Give me one second.
[119:23.24]Wait, what?
[119:59.26]Wait, what?
[121:38.35]Okay.
[121:41.09]Let's go.
[121:43.15]Let's make it happen.
[121:44.05]You know what I mean?
[121:44.93]Let's take away all the bullshit.
[121:47.83]No more bullshit.
[121:50.01]And let's make it actually happen.
[121:54.91]Oh, ding!
[121:56.07]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
[121:57.83]Thank you, Scarlow, for the $15.
[122:00.08]How's the hair today?
[122:00.86]Use these bits for some gel or something if you want.
[122:04.30]Hair's okay, actually.
[122:05.02]Hair's pretty good.
[122:08.46]I can't prove it to you.
[122:10.04]Sorry.
[122:11.38]I would love to prove it to you, but I can't prove it to you.
[122:18.14]What's on my, what is down here?
[122:19.02]Okay.
[122:19.78]Let me get back to this.
[122:22.08]No more bullshit.
[122:22.80]We're gonna like, we're gonna progress through the video game.
[122:27.50]We're gonna do... Alright, hold on.
[122:43.60]What's going on?
[122:47.94]What is happening right now?
[122:49.25]What happened to my controls?
[122:52.43]Poison Chris.
[122:53.07]That was all that was in there.
[122:59.45]Holy God.
[123:04.37]Does everybody kill him?
[123:05.27]Forget about everything else.
[123:06.63]What about up here?
[123:09.48]Can't move this door.
[123:10.32]Um...
[123:16.53]Shit, man.
[123:17.15]I don't know what to do.
[123:18.13]Do I have to move these rocks out of the way?
[123:25.15]Are they blocking the door?
[123:25.99]Get him in the water.
[123:38.98]Get him in that fucking water.
[123:41.66]Okay, that was a pretty cool move.
[123:47.71]He's dead.
[123:48.03]No, he's not.
[123:49.53]Just prevent him from doing the fucking cool move.
[123:55.30]You guys can't see the game?
[123:56.28]What?
[123:58.94]I... I... No more bullshit.
[124:11.57]I think my monitor was blocked.
[124:14.29]You know what?
[124:14.75]I can say whatever I want.
[124:16.71]My monitor was blocked, I'm sorry.
[124:20.99]I didn't know that's how that worked.
[124:29.25]And I'm poisoned, fucking great.
[124:34.88]Well, it's too bad I didn't skip this area, because it's probably my least favorite part of the whole game.
[124:40.56]So, that's unfortunate.
[124:51.80]Okay.
[124:52.14]This way?
[124:52.52]I see this little opening over here.
[124:54.68]Oh, you fucking piece of crap.
[124:58.07]No, and I got the rope bow.
[124:59.01]Okay.
[124:59.21]There's an opening here.
[125:18.27]What just happened?
[125:18.71]What happened?
[125:21.12]Why did I get a loading screen?
[125:26.00]Is this it?
[125:31.53]Somewhere above us.
[125:35.49]Okay.
[125:37.67]Very descriptive.
[125:39.97]I'm just going to drop this, right?
[125:41.37]Just drop it.
[125:44.74]Oh, this is where we get to have some fun.
[125:51.48]Eventually they're gonna get hit by this.
[125:53.44]Somebody's gonna eventually get knocked.
[125:55.84]And it was me that got hit by it.
[125:56.80]I got fucking knocked into it and it was me.
[126:02.57]You gotta be kidding me.
[126:03.61]I got pushed into it.
[126:04.63]Okay.
[126:18.62]There it is.
[126:20.60]Okay, how do I get that?
[126:22.14]Just get it.
[126:22.66]Rope bow.
[126:28.71]Forget about everything else.
[126:29.55]Just grab it.
[126:32.19]And just knock this thing down so you have at least some protection here.
[126:38.89]Grab that.
[126:40.43]Go for it.
[126:41.35]Watch the funny, funny moment.
[126:44.79]You guys know there's going to be a hysterical moment, right?
[126:47.11]Watch this.
[126:48.94]Come on.
[126:52.56]You guys said I was gonna get a lot more skill points.
[126:57.50]What's up with these, like, no skill points?
[127:05.33]I'm in the trash room, okay.
[127:06.61]I need two more.
[127:22.96]Die.
[127:23.36]Dead.
[127:32.05]Okay, I'm very confused right now.
[127:34.29]What is happening right here?
[127:35.13]Do I have to move this?
[127:38.43]Can I move that?
[127:41.83]What a fucking maze.
[127:42.95]Okay.
[127:51.23]Hey, what's that Banjo-Kazooie character?
[127:53.25]What are you trying to say?
[127:53.97]God, I'm gonna scream.
[128:02.08]I have to just robo it.
[128:21.45]Okay, this is freaking me out.
[128:27.12]Plus 10 for execution, minus for bad joke.
[128:29.88]How is that a bad joke?
[128:31.70]Oh my god!
[128:33.60]They're eating her!
[128:37.01]And then they're gonna eat me!
[128:41.01]Oh my god!
[128:43.79]What?
[129:00.13]No!
[129:06.23]I should have skipped this entire goddamn zone.
[129:09.22]I should have got out of here.
[129:11.02]I should have skipped the whole zone.
[129:12.66]I was going to get like four skill points.
[129:14.34]Like, who cares?
[129:16.30]What the fuck?
[129:29.47]No.
[129:30.19]No.
[129:31.15]No, you know what?
[129:32.39]I fucking... I refuse.
[129:33.80]I refuse.
[129:39.86]Where am I?
[130:55.79]I gotta start like a fart.
[131:13.33]Okay.
[131:23.14]Opening the inventory.
[131:27.46]Opening up my inventory.
[131:29.12]It makes me scream.
[131:34.96]Okay, well, I'm not sure what to do.
[131:36.55]There's no way to get out of this.
[131:38.45]I'm trying to get noclip to work.
[131:41.47]I don't think it even acknowledges that this is a function.
[131:47.39]Oh my god, all these things!
[131:51.30]Can I even take a potion?
[132:04.12]Kill doesn't work.
[132:07.39]No, it does.
[132:15.95]Okay.
[132:17.65]Well, that was... That was very interesting.
[132:20.91]My fucking head hurts now.
[132:22.71]God damn it.
[132:32.38]It happened again.
[132:33.22]It happened.
[132:33.62]It happened again.
[132:34.18]It happened again, guys.
[132:34.92]It happened again.
[132:37.62]Here we go.
[132:38.54]This is where we have fun.
[132:42.81]God damn it.
[132:43.61]Hold on.
[132:44.03]Wait.
[132:46.79]Watch.
[132:47.15]We can do it again.
[132:48.13]This time I'm going to fucking noclip it, though.
[132:50.37]And we're going to be able to scream the whole time.
[132:57.78]Every action is going to make me scream.
[132:59.10]And we're saving it that way.
[133:07.36]Jump onto the rope early equals you are fucked.
[133:11.08]Yeah.
[133:11.88]Not quite.
[133:12.38]I gave it a couple more tries.
[133:13.90]Ugh.
[133:13.98]I almost threw up in my mouth.
[133:15.92]Almost.
[133:16.94]One more try.
[133:42.50]Once I could start to be like a fucking soundboard piano.
[133:46.44]No, I went the other way.
[133:48.10]It's gotta like rip the other direction.
[133:51.15]I hit it in the perfect spot.
[133:58.07]Got it, but no, I was in the wrong way.
[134:01.99]Somewhere above one more time.
[134:03.31]I bet this is what you do when you find something fucking weird.
[134:05.24]You have to like try it.
[134:09.37]No, it's... Nope.
[134:11.51]Unfortunately.
[134:12.09]Hey, at least we got to see it once, right?
[134:16.06]Last try.
[134:19.84]Just use telekinesis.
[134:27.26]No.
[134:28.00]Oh, well.
[134:28.76]We got it to try once.
[134:32.77]It was worth it.
[134:33.41]It was worth it to try it once.
[134:35.45]It might be gone forever.
[134:38.96]Oh well.
[134:44.20]Back to reality.
[134:45.32]That was fucking hysterical, though.
[134:49.40]This game is fucking fantastic.
[134:51.99]What an insane game.
[135:01.39]Like, what a monumentally insane experience this has been.
[135:16.50]Well, back to reality.
[135:17.82]Ope, there goes gravity.
[135:19.80]Watch your profanity.
[135:25.19]Now I gotta get back up there.
[135:26.29]I hear things.
[135:32.93]Is that a ball up there?
[135:41.18]Okay.
[135:41.92]Pull it out.
[135:42.96]And here we go.
[135:43.86]Watch out!
[135:44.38]Just did this before.
[135:45.06]Ow.
[135:45.12]Sword of the Dragon Claw.
[135:47.32]Sword of the Dragon Claw.
[135:48.32]Strength 3?
[135:48.54]Don't I... Okay.
[135:51.14]That looks pretty damn good.
[135:53.62]Okay.
[136:13.26]This is waiting for that.
[136:14.02]Can I spin this?
[136:20.27]Why can't I spin the, uh, Price's right wheel?
[136:28.36]How do I get out of here?
[136:45.46]Die!
[136:48.04]Use the rope bow up there?
[136:49.64]Could I?
[136:51.32]Wait, there was a lever up there?
[136:52.36]Where?
[136:52.58]I didn't see a lever.
[137:07.37]There was a lever right in the butt crack?
[137:09.79]What are you talking about?
[137:10.47]There was a lever over here, was there?
[137:13.59]Holy shit, there was!
[137:16.40]Wow.
[137:19.86]And here comes the Smasher.
[137:22.58]Watch out for the Smasher.
[137:26.62]Watch out for the Smasher.
[137:34.68]Oh, come on.
[137:37.43]It was a joke.
[137:38.39]It was a joke.
[137:38.95]Bring it back down here.
[137:42.37]It was messing around.
[137:43.17]It was just a mess around for a second.
[137:55.44]What does that do?
[137:56.76]What is that doing, by the way?
[138:01.53]What is this doing?
[138:03.81]Something over here?
[138:04.43]Am I missing something?
[138:08.01]Is it opening another door?
[138:10.13]I can't tell.
[138:10.77]I'm riding it up.
[138:26.75]I'm gonna ride it back up.
[138:36.14]Can't ride it back up, so it's like opened something.
[138:38.24]I'm gonna have to take a look over here then, or something.
[138:44.24]Easy.
[138:46.42]What is over here that it might have opened?
[138:54.17]I don't fucking see anything.
[139:04.91]All the way up?
[139:08.23]Jump, you fucking idiot.
[139:11.27]Oh my god.
[139:12.67]Why is your jumping mechanic and grab mechanic... And why am I stuck now?
[139:16.40]I'm literally stuck.
[139:17.76]I'm literally stuck.
[139:20.36]Literally.
[139:32.93]I had a chance there.
[139:34.13]I'm fucking about to noclip.
[139:43.14]I really am.
[139:50.78]I'm about to fucking noclip.
[139:56.98]I can drop that.
[140:01.64]I already picked that up.
[140:02.86]Can I just leave?
[140:04.00]Just go back to the hall?
[140:05.74]Right?
[140:09.40]I guess.
[140:10.42]How did I get back there, though?
[140:11.49]I don't even remember where the fuck that was.
[140:20.69]I walked into the room I needed to go into?
[140:22.69]Everything's the fucking same!
[140:29.06]They're all the same doors, the same walls.
[140:31.46]This reminds me of Catacombs of Carthus.
[140:33.86]Which, fuck that level, and fuck that whole game because of that level.
[140:43.37]You know, fuck that whole game.
[140:57.19]Catacombs.
[140:58.99]Am I feeling the three hours yet?
[141:00.79]I mean, now I'm starting to understand.
[141:02.29]Aye!
[141:09.53]Got the armor.
[141:13.07]Just closes the door.
[141:13.99]Well, whatever.
[141:14.63]Can I just go over here?
[141:15.55]Now there's like fucking fire burning me and shit.
[141:23.96]Where on Earth even am I?
[141:25.62]And like, what is this?
[141:27.57]Where's the opening?
[141:28.83]Where's the intro?
[141:31.79]Can I climb this?
[141:36.26]I don't remember.
[141:37.90]It's all blurring together.
[141:38.88]I need to get back up to the spider door.
[141:41.04]Don't die!
[141:41.62]Don't fall and die!
[141:42.64]Please, my god!
[141:43.74]What the fuck is this?
[141:48.22]A sword.
[141:49.88]The wall just exploded.
[141:50.96]Thank god I didn't realize how dumb I am.
[141:53.67]The wall just blew up.
[141:56.96]Here comes a cutscene.
[141:57.54]Loud, be careful.
[141:59.12]I can see you.
[142:01.08]What's happening?
[142:02.06]I need to do this two more times.
[142:05.50]Now I see why this is going to take three hours.
[142:06.92]Okay.
[142:18.79]Isn't this thing supposed to turn and open like another door?
[142:24.75]I have to go back in here.
[142:30.99]Great.
[142:40.64]Time to go back and find this random ass thing that I have no... I wanted the mana potion.
[142:50.79]One down, two more crystals to go.
[142:52.81]This is true.
[142:53.79]And where the hell could the other one even be?
[142:56.99]Because, guys, I don't even remember where I... I don't remember what I had for fucking lunch today.
[143:03.55]Let alone where I even was going before.
[143:05.73]You know what I mean?
[143:12.22]What did I even have for lunch?
[143:15.60]Something.
[143:15.94]I ate something.
[143:19.17]What was it?
[143:19.93]Was it eggs?
[143:20.59]Hard-boiled eggs?
[143:21.43]Maybe.
[143:21.71]I ate some bacon and cheese sausages.
[143:31.36]I didn't, though.
[143:32.50]I would have remembered that.
[143:38.12]Can I open this?
[143:38.78]Let's go back the way that I was.
[143:41.20]I gotta go all the way back.
[143:47.35]I hate this.
[143:49.12]I hate this.
[143:52.32]Yeah, I hate three hours of fucking maze crystal gameplay.
[143:55.72]What is this?
[143:56.06]Like The Legend of Zelda?
[143:57.02]Like the water temple?
[144:01.65]Yeah, cool.
[144:03.57]Bring us like the water temple.
[144:06.55]Walk around and like grab shit.
[144:13.39]I'm just gonna go... Can I open that?
[144:19.90]I don't know.
[144:21.54]I'm about to noclip and find it.
[144:24.81]It's getting there.
[144:25.59]Not there yet, but it is getting there.
[144:26.93]I'm about to noclip to find it.
[144:28.83]To find, like, what I need to do.
[144:34.16]Some Dead Rising shit here, though.
[144:35.40]I can go up there.
[144:46.71]I hear... Something just opened.
[144:48.52]Alright, this is opening.
[144:49.78]Why is this... Why is that happening?
[144:52.26]I have to be in the right room.
[144:53.68]Okay, I haven't been here yet.
[144:57.08]Save this shit.
[144:58.08]And then go grab this thing.
[145:00.08]And then get killed by the trap that's definitely here.
[145:04.91]Not yet, no.
[145:12.58]That's a door that opens that I can't get into.
[145:16.86]More fucking zombie chickens.
[145:18.36]There's the eye of the storm.
[145:25.93]Should these things shoot?
[145:29.97]I hear a lot of people coming up, though.
[145:34.71]Why did I do this legit?
[145:37.19]What was the reasoning for doing this legit?
[145:45.47]Fucking Zappa.
[145:47.58]This thing has to get... Got it!
[145:59.33]Whoa!
[146:01.11]What's that noise?
[146:04.37]What's all these noises that I hear?
[146:05.74]Huh?
[146:12.95]King Darius, leader of the mage sword armies during the Wolves of the Blood.
[146:16.25]Let his crypt be a passage to glory.
[146:17.71]Okay.
[146:18.87]I'm not gonna be in here.
[146:23.26]It's like a dumb boss fight.
[146:25.86]Oh, it's just a way to go down.
[146:27.32]Get out of my face.
[146:30.46]This is gonna break when I do this, so I'm gonna save and then make sure I didn't miss anything.
[146:34.54]It's a person!
[146:35.66]I thought that was a fucking person.
[146:37.74]I have to put that thing back up somewhere, right?
[146:46.52]This poison shit is like, makes me want to scream into my own mouth.
[146:56.57]I think I poisoned again.
[146:59.55]God damn it.
[147:06.42]I can put this thing back somewhere.
[147:15.61]Get down!
[147:16.17]Knock down!
[147:16.69]I went over his head.
[147:23.57]Got him.
[147:26.87]This is just a- an Elder Scrolls game?
[147:31.05]Well, this thing- I- this is like kinda cool though.
[147:34.63]It's kinda cool.
[147:37.91]Where does this guy go?
[147:38.71]Right over here?
[147:39.11]Yeah.
[147:42.33]Now what did that do for me?
[147:44.76]Some free shit?
[147:49.27]Ooh!
[147:50.15]Save it.
[147:50.61]Okay, so there's like a gigantic creature back here.
[147:57.12]Taking a long time to open this.
[148:02.06]Secret area.
[148:05.22]Got mana potion.
[148:12.61]Sometimes I just get hurt in this game and it don't make any sense.
[148:18.27]Coca-Cola, Scroll of Freeze.
[148:22.54]And some of that stuff.
[148:23.42]Okay.
[148:27.32]I need to use these, man.
[148:32.30]I need to get three more points.
[148:36.72]That's the best shield in the game.
[148:39.61]Well, I can use a shield.
[148:40.55]Should I put it on?
[148:43.69]Can I put it on with just my regular sword or something?
[148:48.96]I need more strength.
[148:49.95]This is, like, just bad.
[148:50.99]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[149:02.81]Well, whatever.
[149:03.29]Let's go.
[149:10.31]Let's go down into the abyss.
[149:12.85]Continue our, like, three-hour gameplay of this.
[149:15.70]Smash...
[149:17.86]Quest saved.
[149:19.19]Here we go.
[149:21.21]It's a two-handed shield.
[149:24.91]I thought I was dead.
[149:27.41]There's a whole nother area down here.
[149:30.37]How much more is down here?
[149:31.61]And it's with a maze.
[149:37.00]It's a huge maze.
[149:38.06]It's gotta be just in this little tunnel or in a cave somewhere, right?
[149:40.88]Is that it?
[149:43.38]Okay, we're near one.
[149:44.76]Is it right there?
[149:47.82]Nope.
[149:48.54]It's just in here somewhere.
[149:51.80]The Jewel of the Seven Kingdoms.
[149:59.91]It's up there.
[150:02.81]I'm gonna save scum here just in case something bad happens.
[150:05.79]Okay, it's definitely right there.
[150:11.06]And in here is, out of the sarcophagus, is going to be King Leonidas.
[150:18.71]Do you hear the whispers?
[150:21.31]Do you hear the whispers?
[150:32.43]Hey!
[150:35.21]Boo!
[150:36.21]Boo!
[150:51.62]He's not so bad.
[150:54.96]Even when he goes invisible.
[150:56.70]I can still see him.
[151:07.85]I did it.
[151:14.97]Somebody clip that quick.
[151:16.49]Somebody clip that and give it to me.
[151:19.00]Clip it.
[151:21.88]I need to get that clipped.
[151:30.58]Let's see it.
[151:31.86]Okay.
[151:38.43]Everyone's trying to clip it.
[151:39.59]Nobody can post it.
[151:40.39]Is that it?
[151:41.41]Okay, here it is.
[151:51.38]No.
[151:51.72]God damn it.
[151:52.90]Give me the real one.
[151:53.60]Not bad.
[151:55.50]Okay.
[151:57.40]Even when he goes... Find it.
[152:02.34]I did it!
[152:09.51]Somebody clip that, quick.
[152:10.47]Give me another one.
[152:10.99]Somebody clip that and give it to me.
[152:15.87]Give me that one.
[152:19.84]Give me that one.
[152:23.92]I got to do it two more times.
[152:24.78]Come on.
[152:35.51]Find it.
[152:36.51]I did it.
[152:39.23]One more.
[152:41.04]Give me another one.
[152:42.66]Somebody clip that and give it to me.
[152:57.01]It's too quiet.
[152:58.39]It's too quiet.
[152:59.43]Fuck.
[152:59.71]I gotta do it two more times.
[153:07.63]Come on.
[153:14.56]Wait.
[153:16.38]Wait.
[153:17.68]Wait.
[153:24.21]That's not going to work.
[153:26.61]It's not going to work.
[153:27.97]We're done.
[153:30.13]You can't make the clips louder.
[153:31.25]They keep losing compression every time.
[153:35.08]Let's hear what we did.
[153:38.76]That's going to take over all of them.
[153:40.06]That's not going to be worth doing.
[153:51.91]Something went wrong apparently with that one.
[153:55.30]I just wanna hear it.
[154:06.70]Wait.
[154:08.52]Wait.
[154:09.82]Wait.
[154:16.35]That's not gonna work.
[154:17.61]No, it's not gonna work.
[154:20.03]My volume's at max.
[154:21.03]We're done.
[154:22.19]We tried.
[154:24.17]Every time a new clip comes in, even when it's at max volume, it doesn't matter.
[154:31.90]It's alright, we tried.
[154:33.02]Let's go.
[154:39.88]I created the worst chord in history.
[154:44.07]Just play them individually?
[154:45.89]That's... I don't... I'm not gonna... I gotta open, like, fucking ten tabs.
[154:52.29]Alright, back... Back to reality.
[154:57.07]Let's play all the clips simultaneously.
[155:01.31]It worked when he did it in sorcery.
[155:03.57]I don't know what the deal was, but I didn't change anything.
[155:11.96]Because I had my volume as high as it could go.
[155:13.66]Oh, well.
[155:15.64]Staff of the Fire Lord already have one of those.
[155:17.18]Hey, look at that.
[155:28.34]We're done.
[155:31.92]Just need one... Get out of here.
[155:37.32]I already have a staff of the Fire Lord.
[155:38.74]I don't need two.
[155:39.82]There's another one in here.
[155:46.06]In there.
[155:48.16]Guys, I might... Guys, I know... We've been here for a long... Guys, I'm... I think I'm gonna... I think I'm gonna no-click through there and just get it.
[155:58.47]I mean, like, come on.
[155:59.17]This is a fucking water temple.
[156:00.21]You really want to sit here at the water temple anymore?
[156:01.77]Alright, let's take a look.
[156:09.87]Strength!
[156:11.17]Bang.
[156:16.26]We got one in strength.
[156:19.04]Can I put any of these on?
[156:20.16]Not yet.
[156:21.12]I need one more in strength for this one.
[156:24.62]And that is eight skill points.
[156:31.56]I do want to get rid of the staff that I had.
[156:33.01]I have two of them now, right?
[156:35.89]I have the Fire Lord.
[156:36.81]I don't need it anymore.
[156:41.43]Don't cheat.
[156:42.03]I won't cheat then.
[156:46.37]We'll do it legit.
[156:49.32]Where's that other staff that I picked up?
[156:51.54]Confused.
[156:58.30]That kind of hurt my head doing that, but it's okay.
[157:05.58]Nice dodge.
[157:09.32]He's actually dead.
[157:10.02]Alright, is it just in here?
[157:11.64]If it's just in here, I thought that was it.
[157:17.64]Whoa!
[157:19.06]That's gonna happen to me!
[157:28.26]Get it to come out.
[157:35.13]You didn't die from those spikes?
[157:37.33]What the fuck?
[157:42.14]Jesus Christ!
[157:54.36]She yells at me.
[157:54.96]She goes, it's not this way.
[157:55.86]Go, go, go.
[157:56.38]Run away.
[157:56.78]Yeah.
[158:01.91]Okay.
[158:02.37]Okay.
[158:06.28]I'm no clipping through and I'm picking it up.
[158:28.07]She told me I could jump.
[158:29.72]You don't tell somebody you can jump but then you can't jump.
[158:32.76]That's not how that works.
[158:35.17]Don't tell me to jump.
[158:53.74]Should I just noclip through the fucking wall and be done with this here?
[158:57.20]Just be done with it.
[159:07.89]I overshot it.
[159:08.47]I'm good.
[159:09.27]Alright.
[159:15.37]Give me it.
[159:15.87]It's down here somewhere, right?
[159:17.35]Where is it?
[159:19.73]There was something twinkling down there, though.
[159:21.77]Right?
[159:24.57]What was twinkling?
[159:26.56]There was some twinkling Titanite.
[159:27.86]Oh, there was some twinkling Titanite down there.
[159:34.24]Cheating.
[159:34.68]I didn't cheat.
[159:36.74]I did the exact opposite of cheating.
[159:42.31]Come on, move the fucking gems the other way.
[160:12.57]Did my steps just get way louder?
[160:13.95]That was weird.
[160:16.75]Back up here.
[160:18.49]Yep, I remember this.
[160:20.09]Aye yi yi, guys.
[160:23.89]So where is it?
[160:31.47]Oh, god damn it.
[160:34.88]God damn it.
[160:43.12]What is this?
[160:43.56]Is this it?
[160:44.36]The Ring of Regeneration.
[160:45.98]And something else.
[160:54.53]There it is.
[160:55.09]Got it.
[161:02.81]Ow.
[161:03.23]Stop with the dumb traps.
[161:05.95]I got it.
[161:06.41]We're done.
[161:08.63]Grab the fucking chain and get me out.
[161:17.67]Get me out of here.
[161:19.22]I did it legit.
[161:20.84]You guys didn't believe that I was going to do the fucking water temple legit, but I did.
[161:25.14]It's done.
[161:25.62]Be done with it.
[161:26.76]It's over.
[161:28.36]Save the game.
[161:29.60]Let's keep going.
[161:32.88]And I'm glad I did that for like five skill points.
[161:38.78]You know, use the term like worth it, not worth it.
[161:41.43]That was not worth it.
[161:44.69]That really was three hours.
[161:45.77]No, that was like an hour and ten minutes.
[161:48.01]That was like an hour.
[161:55.33]This is where the scary guy was here, right?
[162:00.51]Scary guy's tomb.
[162:01.44]I'm just going to keep going back.
[162:06.50]There's a shortcut.
[162:08.78]You know what?
[162:09.14]There is a shortcut.
[162:09.90]You're right.
[162:11.80]I should use it, shouldn't I?
[162:15.92]I should use the shortcut that I have.
[162:21.19]Sometimes it's the journey, not the prize.
[162:22.97]Like, should I just use my own shortcut?
[162:24.87]I might in a second here.
[162:31.92]Got my own fucking shortcut.
[162:35.28]I'm seeing a lot of people say, no.
[162:37.22]I have to run back legit.
[162:40.20]I've come so far, I just cheat.
[162:41.52]You know, that's true.
[162:43.85]But, like, I don't even know where the fuck I am.
[162:48.32]So, I don't know.
[162:48.94]I might have to go the other way.
[162:49.86]I don't know where the fuck I even am, guys.
[162:54.16]Like, where the fuck am I?
[163:00.39]How do I get the hell out of here?
[163:06.17]Where did I even come from?
[163:16.86]Is there even a fucking exit here?
[163:18.08]Did I drop down?
[163:19.78]I'm just gonna go in the other fucking direction.
[163:23.04]I'm so sick of this fucking dark-ass place.
[163:33.93]Use the magic whistle.
[163:37.31]What happened?
[163:39.97]Oh, it's just black.
[163:41.27]I can't see anything.
[163:49.79]You guys are talking about, like, this way, right?
[163:53.25]Is this the way that you were talking about?
[163:54.55]I don't even know.
[163:56.21]Everything's the same.
[163:58.57]I'm back, like, up here where I was.
[163:59.99]Like, where the fuck even am I?
[164:01.91]What happened?
[164:02.40]Let me just put on the fucking Virtual Boy again.
[164:08.96]And run around in circles.
[164:16.42]I can't...
[164:19.61]Just say map.

[164:38.79]Where's the dev?

[165:39.90]You guys hear this shit, right?
[165:51.50]I don't think I can grab this.
[166:02.50]Can I get this?
[166:08.15]Okay.
[166:10.53]Made it.
[166:13.65]Hey, look at that.
[166:18.40]Can I open this door?
[166:20.48]Is this like a secret door?
[166:23.60]What a genius, I know.
[166:24.62]What a fucking genius, huh?
[166:27.44]Now let's get this over with.
[166:34.01]Get this over with.
[166:34.91]Can I go to the rainbow level again?
[166:37.51]Is that a thing?
[166:38.07]Can we do that?
[166:42.17]Can we do that stuff?
[166:44.33]We got one.
[166:45.63]I turned on the night vision accidentally.
[166:49.39]We got another one to put in.
[166:51.53]Put it in.
[166:52.01]Now we can complete it.
[167:02.84]Jerma, you're cutting stickers for your Etsy shop and decided to stop by.
[167:07.18]What's going on?
[167:09.24]I really don't know.
[167:12.11]I'm trying to figure that out.
[167:13.15]Welcome.
[167:30.89]Oh, you thought I was gonna die, didn't you?
[167:32.78]LOL.
[167:33.36]One health.
[167:34.52]Actually, kill me.
[167:37.42]It's a waste of health.
[167:46.86]Fucking I'm laughing about it a little bit.
[167:48.48]Twice daily.
[167:50.66]Now it's so anticlimactic because there's no audio.
[167:54.79]Alright, let's open it.
[168:00.67]Slide in.
[168:02.63]There it is.
[168:03.31]Remember?
[168:04.05]Remember when I got here?
[168:05.10]Let's do a little bit of a take back here.
[168:07.08]I got here before.
[168:08.80]Now we're here legit.
[168:11.26]And we're going to kill all the spiders before we get the crown, right?
[168:14.60]I remember.
[168:15.32]Here's your three hour reward.
[168:21.39]Shut up.
[168:28.43]defeat the spiders to obtain the artifact.
[168:41.91]I mean, I'm okay with this.
[168:45.03]Okay, I was going to say, is that exploding before him or is that actually hitting him?
[168:48.63]Sometimes I can't tell.
[168:49.45]Spell's not ready yet.
[168:52.81]Make it ready, motherfucker.
[168:55.30]Get it ready then, dude.
[169:00.95]How is this cheating?
[169:01.65]This is a game mechanic.
[169:07.93]This is cheating apparently, right?
[169:10.36]How is this cheating?
[169:11.08]And look at that.
[169:11.58]Fucking triple kill.
[169:14.28]TRIPLE kill.
[169:23.02]No!
[169:33.24]Jumper me again.
[169:34.12]I dare you That's it I got four skill points I Got the Skeletor challenge The spice finger of death More cheesing than cheating you actually cleared this area without all the skill points.
[169:57.09]Oh
[169:58.59]I know.
[169:59.82]But then I wouldn't be able to say that I beat, like, all this shit legit.
[170:03.08]And, you know, why not?
[170:03.92]Why not be able to say that?
[170:05.42]Here comes a very loud cutscene.
[170:06.94]I recommend dropping the volume a little because I can't alt-tap.
[170:10.59]So, fair warning, here comes a loud-ass cutscene.
[170:31.35]Ah, I gotta take my headset.
[170:32.57]My headset is out.
[170:33.87]My headphones are out.
[170:45.35]It has been a thousand years, Zareth, since the seventh dragon banished our kind from the face of Ashtar.
[170:52.88]For ten centuries, we have waited for our vengeance.
[170:58.20]We have waited for you.
[171:01.94]You are the one foretold by the wizard Sarge Lazar, the dark messiah of ancient prophecy.
[171:11.05]You, my son, and my heir, the herald of fire and of blood.
[171:18.66]The creature that accompanies you is yours.
[171:20.82]Use her as you see fit.
[171:27.19]Now, take up the skull of my ancient enemy and shatter the prison that holds me.
[171:34.30]This, my son, I command you.
[171:39.66]And once I am free, this world and every soul in it will be ours.
[171:50.56]I want to be the voice of that guy.
[171:52.02]How do I do that?
[171:56.61]What the hell was that?
[171:58.01]Oh, that's the skull.
[171:58.91]Do I put that on?
[172:00.56]The skull of shadows is not for the likes of you.
[172:04.16]Demon spawn.
[172:05.06]So loud.
[172:06.02]Please.
[172:07.96]Does he have to get a max volume?
[172:09.38]The seventh dragon did not sacrifice himself so that some demon's bastard could undo all his labors.
[172:18.72]I do this for the sake of all Ashan.
[172:25.04]Did I, like, lose the game?
[172:26.68]The prophecy of the Dark Messiah ends here.
[172:30.08]What the fuck?
[172:31.54]Okay.
[172:31.74]What's my debrief?
[172:32.84]So now I'm undead.
[172:55.80]What happened?
[172:57.28]Arantir killed you.
[172:58.90]I used the energy of the skull to revive you.
[173:02.86]I feel different.
[173:05.68]Not surprising.
[173:06.82]Do I get undead powers now?
[173:09.43]And some of my powers are yours to command.
[173:12.59]Where's Arantir?
[173:14.19]Gone with the skull.
[173:15.23]We'll have to hurry to stop him.
[173:17.83]Stop him?
[173:18.79]I'm going to kill him.
[173:20.13]Persevere to use your demon form.
[173:21.75]The orcs took all your equipment.
[173:23.59]What?
[173:23.87]They thought you were dead.
[173:25.50]Let's show them that they've made a little mistake.
[173:32.57]So I can turn into a hunter from Left 4 Dead.
[173:34.67]I don't have any... Where's my stuff?
[173:38.01]I don't know.
[173:52.01]I don't have any weapons or anything anymore.
[173:57.63]I Found a secret If I can't see anything lightning she like where's my what the fuck is going on The orcs took my backpack.
[174:08.47]Give me a break Here's my demonic flashlight Do I have like a demonic super jump
[174:34.47]Okay, well, here we go.
[174:37.61]Can I, like, eat people?
[174:41.13]I'm going for the move, the eat.
[174:49.29]I'm just, like, waving my fucking hands around.
[174:53.72]That's all I'm doing.
[174:54.28]This really is just Left 4 Dead.
[174:55.46]I just need the hunter's scream.
[174:57.58]I like the smoker's scream.
[175:02.79]Oh no, not another bridge.
[175:04.17]I gotta turn this off.
[175:26.29]Oh no, baby spiders!
[175:30.07]How do I eat someone?
[175:33.72]Can I eat someone?
[175:37.96]There it is.
[175:42.92]Okay, got all my stuff.
[175:47.89]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[175:50.53]Got six skill points.
[175:51.53]I need a few more.
[175:53.25]Need a couple more here.
[175:54.07]Can we open this?
[175:54.93]We can't.
[175:57.05]Being a demon drains your HP.
[175:58.55]I did realize that was happening.
[176:00.01]I'm glad I did.
[176:01.51]Do I have to climb back up here?
[176:07.45]This can't be opened either.
[176:11.87]Well, that's interesting.
[176:14.72]Interesting stuff.
[176:21.68]Melee kills the demon instantly heal.
[176:23.30]Okay, well, how do I get out of here then?
[176:25.50]Do I have to use the rope again?
[176:30.01]You give me all these demon powers and I still have to use the rope bow?
[176:39.07]Unlock the door?
[176:41.44]I can't unlock the door.
[176:43.22]Didn't do anything.
[176:51.80]Rope bow.
[176:58.18]Wait, hold on.
[177:00.60]No, don't ride the swing.
[177:05.18]Well, they've successfully captured me because I can't get out of here.
[177:07.88]I was like this fucking demon.
[177:12.14]You did a good job, guys.
[177:15.30]You got me.
[177:16.30]You captured me.
[177:24.50]Just noclip through the rest of the game.
[177:26.91]Yeah.
[177:28.43]You wonky ass piece of shit.
[177:34.33]Okay.
[177:35.39]Let's go.
[177:37.79]So where the fuck am I going here?
[177:39.21]There's a chest I can't open.
[177:44.90]What if I smash it with a rock?
[177:46.92]That didn't work.
[177:53.38]Okay.
[177:54.70]So where was I going before?
[177:58.07]I can go all the way back to that secret.
[178:03.69]Which was... Where again?
[178:07.37]Down?
[178:09.13]Up?
[178:09.60]Around?
[178:10.12]It was back here, right?
[178:15.54]Yeah.
[178:21.00]Just looking for a later.
[178:23.32]Just looking for a later.
[178:30.84]Is this worth going back all the way back here for?
[178:32.46]I mean, I'm like all the way back here.
[178:36.48]And I don't even... I don't... Guys, I don't even remember where it is.
[178:38.36]I... I... I don't... I don't fucking have any goddamn fucking memory.
[178:47.17]Like zero memory.
[178:49.23]I think it was in here.
[178:54.17]No, but this is just back... We're just going around in fucking circles.
[179:01.60]You know what I've realized since playing this game?
[179:05.40]Ever since developers started putting in a map, you just can't get lost anymore.
[179:11.31]Now you can.
[179:19.63]If I had a little blip on the map to tell me where I even fucking am.
[179:25.70]Where is it?
[179:32.50]And here?
[179:35.36]God.
[179:38.56]How does my computer work if I have zero memory?
[179:43.98]How does anything work if I have zero memory, really?
[179:50.41]I'm just in circles now.
[179:55.29]Give me a fucking map!
[179:56.87]Give me a fucking map of this place!
[180:02.69]I just can't see anything.
[180:04.31]It's so fucking dark.
[180:06.91]I can't tell where the fuck I even am.
[180:08.63]Give me a goddamn compass game.
[180:15.27]Before I fucking scream.
[180:20.50]I like went in there too.
[180:21.62]Like I don't even know where I am.
[180:23.42]Mom, where am I?
[180:31.72]I'm just like drowning.
[180:32.62]I'm going around and fucking drowning.
[180:38.22]I've lost all control.
[180:39.48]I'm in a different fucking zone now.
[180:42.53]I'm in a different area completely.
[180:44.15]And I can't turn off the fucking virtual boy.
[180:47.75]Oh my god.
[180:48.63]I can't even jump.
[180:53.11]I can't do anything.
[181:01.70]Where the fuck am I?
[181:06.77]I don't know.
[181:16.37]If I only had a compass, like, didn't even tell me what fucking north, south, east, and west, it would make this five fucking thousand times easier for me.
[181:25.30]Like, sense of direction is just so impossible.
[181:27.32]When everything looks the same, everything is dark, and you have no fucking compass.
[181:34.25]Oh, I'm so fucking actually angry right now.
[181:45.96]This is fucking banana land.
[181:55.28]This whole thing is banana land to me in my brain.
[181:58.64]I can't even see anything.
[182:11.38]I can't turn on the night vision thing.
[182:13.30]What the fuck?
[182:15.84]Where am I even going?
[182:18.35]Oh my.
[182:18.79]I'm about to turn the stream off.
[182:20.71]I'm that angry right now.
[182:22.05]That I can't fucking do this.
[182:24.03]This Fraggle Rock fucking piece of shit game.
[182:26.33]Seriously.
[182:39.45]I don't even remember what the fuck I'm even looking for.
[182:41.11]I'm in a blind fucking rage right now.
[182:47.69]Okay, there it is.
[182:49.92]This is it, right?
[182:50.68]It's like down here.
[182:51.60]I don't think I give a fuck anymore.
[183:12.80]I don't even know what I'm looking for.
[183:17.35]I'm in such a blind rage.
[183:19.19]I don't even know what I'm doing.
[183:28.46]I can't.
[183:28.90]I'm just gonna move on.
[183:30.42]I can't fucking do it.
[183:32.38]I'm drowning.
[183:34.66]I made it.
[183:35.02]I made it.
[183:36.36]I made it to the secret area.
[183:37.27]I did it.
[183:48.08]Give me this shit now.
[183:50.31]And get me the fuck out of here.
[184:00.15]Fuck you, rocks.
[184:02.06]Fuck you, same texture on the ground, walls, and ceiling.
[184:11.12]Ugh.
[184:12.97]This hurt my whole body.
[184:23.32]Let me put this back down to normal.
[184:28.08]Look at this.
[184:28.66]This is like what it wants you.
[184:30.80]Here comes a complaint.
[184:31.64]Ready for me to complain about this?
[184:33.18]This is where it wants you to play the game.
[184:35.32]You understand?
[184:36.96]Look at me.
[184:37.76]Look at me in the eyes.
[184:38.98]You look at me in the eyes, barely visible.
[184:40.63]Look at me in the eyes.
[184:42.81]You look at me in the eyes and tell me to play the game like this.
[184:47.65]Look me right in my eyes.
[184:50.47]I want you to look at me in my eyes.
[184:53.59]This is how it wants you to play the game.
[185:05.58]Some people probably play the game like this.
[185:07.80]What the fuck?
[185:16.55]There's a mechanic for the dark.
[185:17.93]Yeah, and it's like a shitty gel stage light cover.
[185:23.90]This is what happens when you put, like, okay, this is what happens when you take 3D glasses.
[185:30.02]Don't tell me that this mode is fucking good.
[185:32.39]Don't tell me that's a good mechanic.
[185:34.61]That's taking the blue part of the 3D glasses, punching out the red, putting them on your head, and then shining a flashlight in your fucking face.
[185:43.57]That ain't no mechanic.
[185:50.19]What's the mechanic there?
[185:51.93]Pain?
[185:54.08]Suffering?
[185:56.52]Press G for the map.
[185:58.30]It's not even bound anymore.
[186:00.78]It's not even bound anymore.
[186:03.96]And now I'm back here.
[186:09.31]I guess I'm going to figure out what this is.
[186:12.61]It's not G for map.
[186:13.73]Guys, it's not even bound anymore.
[186:15.91]I'm pressing it.
[186:16.65]I promise you.
[186:22.98]G is the map.
[186:24.05]Bind it.
[186:24.53]And now something's all fucked up.
[186:25.71]My hands aren't even on here.
[186:26.63]I'm all flustered.
[186:28.75]I'm all angry at this fucking... This is also blue.
[186:32.01]Just climb up this.
[186:34.77]Get me up here.
[186:38.16]Plus L for the map.
[186:42.24]Where am I going here?
[186:43.36]What is this for?
[186:44.04]Was any of this for anything?
[186:54.39]Okay, I made it.
[186:55.87]I made it.
[186:56.39]I made it back to where I was.
[187:01.37]We're good.
[187:02.89]The world is at peace now.
[187:04.31]Save the game.
[187:09.31]Go back to Fraggle fucking Rock.
[187:12.57]So, what... What was I even doing?
[187:15.84]Let me use the controller.
[187:21.08]Now I need to remember what I was even doing over here.
[187:25.47]Because I don't remember what I was even doing over... What the fuck was that noise?
[187:28.21]What the fuck was that noise?
[187:34.58]You... Wait, wait.
[187:35.14]I want to look at that.
[187:36.12]Let me see what that all was for.
[187:40.82]Let me look at it.
[187:41.70]Can I not, like, pull it up?
[187:52.05]I guess I... Maybe I... I don't know.
[187:55.50]Put all my shit back on.
[187:56.46]What happened to my rings?
[188:02.42]Flex on the stream.
[188:06.53]I'm going to get rid of these fucking scrolls.
[188:09.09]I have so many of these.
[188:11.95]I'm just going to use the scrolls.
[188:13.25]I don't even know what they're going to do, but we're going to use them.
[188:22.67]Can you have my Minecraft account?
[188:25.48]no no nobody can have my Minecraft account where's my weapon get on there I gotta put this up here don't I yeah okay so I got I escaped from this
[188:51.33]Which would have brought me to, like, over here, right?
[188:54.91]No, this is just going back up the circle.
[189:00.11]So that means I have to go down this way.
[189:02.47]Wrap around.
[189:03.07]I don't have a RuneScape account.
[189:06.03]Sorry, guys.
[189:06.69]I'm sorry.
[189:09.17]I'm just gonna walk this way.
[189:10.23]I guess.
[189:19.66]You know why I can't remember what I had for lunch today?
[189:23.14]Because I haven't eaten anything since last night.
[189:26.34]That's what happened.
[189:29.67]I haven't eaten any food since yesterday afternoon.
[189:34.83]That's the last time I consumed food.
[189:39.97]So I should probably go eat food soon.
[189:41.72]So I'm not delirious.
[189:49.75]Because I think that's what's happening.
[189:50.63]I think I'm like running on like empty fuel.
[189:55.38]I'm running off like an empty fucking gas can right now.
[190:01.76]I just... That whole thing just threw me off so bad.
[190:04.24]I don't even know which direction I'm supposed to even be going.
[190:07.50]There's like one fucking cave entrance I have to go in that I don't know where the fuck it even is.
[190:15.79]Bingo fuel.
[190:17.05]Like that way?
[190:17.83]I don't fucking know.
[190:20.42]Alright, remember we did this last time?
[190:22.32]I'm going to stand completely still.
[190:25.21]Should I go straight?
[190:27.63]I'm about to noclip out.
[190:38.45]Sure, like the first guy says, sure.
[190:40.29]I don't give a fuck.
[190:46.53]Wait, what?
[190:51.68]I can't even turn on noclip.
[190:57.92]I can't turn noclip on.
[190:59.02]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[191:14.11]Get out of the fucking way.
[191:15.11]Get out of my way.
[191:20.66]Get the fuck out of my goddamn way.
[191:22.78]Stupid fucking game.
[191:24.74]You dumbass game.
[191:25.69]Like, you stupid game.
[191:30.37]Why is that here?
[191:31.01]You dumb game.
[191:32.09]You stupid, you stupid, stupid game.
[191:34.83]You have to jump over the fucking door.
[191:36.65]You don't open the door, you jump over the door with a rope bow.
[191:38.59]Alright, everybody calm down.
[191:52.58]Hangry?
[191:54.89]No, I'm just kidding.
[191:56.83]It's just a joke.
[191:57.65]It's just a jokey joke.
[192:00.17]Let's use these scrolls.
[192:01.03]Scrolls of fireball.
[192:05.33]Oh, I'd make like a giant fireball.
[192:08.86]Alright, well that guy like exploded.
[192:10.58]Let's do that again.
[192:11.18]I'm gonna do it like a couple more times.
[192:15.60]Ooh, I can make a thing here.
[192:21.98]What's this one?
[192:22.46]Fire Trap.
[192:27.60]If he stands in that, he'll... Okay, that's an explosion.
[192:30.13]I didn't know it exploded.
[192:32.11]What's this one?
[192:33.35]Scroll of Lightning Bolt.
[192:34.31]That's good.
[192:39.61]Use him as ingredients.
[192:40.51]Okay.
[192:43.96]Do I have anything to put into this?
[192:52.52]I don't think I even have any... I don't have any, like, stuff to put in here.
[192:58.08]It's a trap.
[193:00.22]What is this?
[193:02.26]Full health potion.
[193:03.16]I can't open this shit.
[193:06.05]Can I telekinesis this?
[193:08.03]I don't think I can.
[193:09.41]But I'm gonna try anyways.
[193:13.67]No.
[193:15.47]I don't know.
[193:15.83]There's probably, like, a gold bar that I had at some point.
[193:28.96]I need to go through these and throw them.
[193:30.22]Okay, get this out of here.
[193:34.76]So these ones are good.
[193:36.02]I don't want to get rid of these.
[193:37.02]Longbow.
[193:38.44]Get rid of the regular daggers.
[193:41.86]Do I have two rope bows?
[193:42.84]I feel like I'm just carrying all this shit.
[193:48.37]I have an endless quiver.
[193:49.35]I keep thinking that's a gold bar.
[193:52.99]I need another Endurance.
[193:55.25]Press G to sharpen the sword.
[193:57.58]I can put this on, but I lose.
[193:59.44]It's +2 armor.
[194:00.24]Endurance, one.
[194:02.72]I lose ten mana.
[194:05.36]Let's try it.
[194:06.30]Might be worth it.
[194:12.05]Whoops.
[194:14.79]Mmm...
[194:18.80]Well, that's just the way it is, I guess.
[194:21.06]I don't think there's anything else I can do over here.
[194:23.36]Can I go up there?
[194:28.06]Sharpen your senses.
[194:30.52]Take the fucking senses.
[194:34.41]Just somebody make a map and paint so I never get lost.
[194:39.35]That's fucking hilarious, actually.
[194:41.71]I feel like somebody... I feel like I want a map and paint.
[194:46.11]Well, whatever I could do here, I can't, so...
[194:53.45]I'm like lighting up like a Christmas tree right now.
[195:02.38]That's a gigantic fucking person over there.
[195:05.80]He can't fit in this hole, right?
[195:11.91]He's definitely, he has to be like too big to fit in here.
[195:15.73]Come on.
[195:16.31]You fucking dodge it.
[195:17.21]Get the... Seriously.
[195:19.39]Just die.
[195:22.29]Come here.
[195:26.42]I just, like, stubbed his toe.
[195:38.34]Are we gonna have to drop something on him?
[195:43.02]Or is he a moron?
[195:43.88]He's just gonna...
[195:45.58]Alright, he's just an idiot.
[195:48.16]Oh!
[195:48.44]Oh!
[195:48.82]Oh!
[195:49.38]Oh!
[195:49.92]He's an idiot!
[195:51.90]He's an idiot, but so am I!
[195:58.17]Got him.
[196:05.25]You fucking idiot.
[196:07.29]I'm the best.
[196:09.51]I poked out your eye.
[196:11.67]You fucking wanker.
[196:15.48]Is he turning to stone?
[196:16.24]What is he doing?
[196:16.72]This is a very long death scene.
[196:27.77]What else am I supposed to do here to this guy?
[196:30.47]He's just bumping into shit.
[196:34.01]Do I have to drop that on him?
[196:34.99]I feel like he's getting into position.
[196:40.98]Nope.
[196:41.98]That was just a very long time.
[196:45.88]Okay.
[196:50.11]Bye.
[196:52.25]That was very, very anticlimactic.
[196:59.63]Well, that was fun.
[197:04.96]Pull this open.
[197:07.30]He was getting into position to die.
[197:10.13]He's just like a cat.
[197:12.73]Don't cats run away to a specific place?
[197:14.97]Like in the wild, they're just like, I'm going to go over under that tree when I die.
[197:20.72]Right there.
[197:23.62]Okay, so anything... Wait, let me check to make sure there's nothing else in here.
[197:26.30]I feel like there was a lot of options to kill he just died before I could even do anything.
[197:34.45]I feel like this is supposed to be a big battle that I didn't do.
[197:38.77]What about up there?
[197:42.05]Hey, look at all this stuff.
[197:44.53]There's so much cool shit that could have happened.
[197:46.07]This is why people didn't use the Source Engine, ever.
[197:55.57]Like, four games came out for the fucking Source Engine.
[197:58.41]That's why.
[198:00.59]Like, what you're watching right now is why that happened.
[198:07.83]God.
[198:18.33]I wanted just to jump.
[198:19.19]That's all I wanted to do.
[198:19.97]I wanted to jump up there.
[198:38.66]I'm supposed to jump up here.
[198:39.94]Like this.
[198:40.28]Get the fuck off of me, please.
[198:48.82]I'm about to say fuck this.
[198:53.30]Like, this is so easy to grab this and get on it.
[198:55.38]Like, it's so simple.
[199:00.76]I just did it.
[199:02.14]Like, that's how I want to do it.
[199:04.34]But I can't.
[199:06.29]Now I can't even grab the edges anymore.
[199:11.61]Oh my fucking god.
[199:15.19]You know, whatever I could use over there, I don't even care.
[199:17.19]I'm done.
[199:25.04]Bye.
[199:25.56]Get the fuck out of there.
[199:30.73]Stupid ass fucking... Alright, hold on.
[199:33.85]There's my two strength.
[199:35.89]Now I can actually use this Earth fire sword.
[199:37.79]That's what I was looking for the whole time.
[199:42.36]Let's see.
[199:44.70]Very cool.
[199:47.10]Crisis's source?
[199:48.04]It is not... What do you mean, crisis's source?
[199:53.61]I wonder if we can climb up there somehow.
[199:56.55]We can.
[199:58.96]What's the... Okay, it's just plus three damage.
[200:02.12]Cool.
[200:23.29]We got it.
[200:24.93]We actually got it.
[200:59.57]Okay, let's... Everything's red now.
[201:11.35]Alright, well this is interesting.
[201:18.60]Is there anything else I could look at?
[201:19.86]I'm kind of just... No.
[201:26.74]I don't remember where I even was.
[201:37.67]There we go again.
[201:38.43]Remember that one, guys?
[201:50.78]Can't tap again.
[202:02.06]Not gonna do that again.
[202:02.90]And it is gonna happen again.
[202:06.11]Yeah, sure.
[202:07.17]Get the fuck over here.
[202:08.39]Come on.
[202:09.05]Seriously.
[202:09.67]I... It's...
[202:18.09]It's hard to defend this game sometimes.
[202:20.63]It's funny.
[202:21.39]This shit's fucking funny, right?
[202:23.21]It's funny stuff.
[202:24.71]Funny, buggy-ass fucking game.
[202:26.79]It's funny sometimes.
[202:28.17]But don't give me shit when I'm having problems with the game.
[202:30.86]Don't give me a... Don't give me lip.
[202:33.34]Don't give me any, like, fucking lip when, like, crazy shit happens.
[202:36.52]And it's hard for me to find things when stuff like this is capable in this game.
[202:41.02]Don't give me any goddamn lip about it, alright?
[202:46.56]Wait, what did I just do?
[202:47.38]I did something wrong.
[202:48.00]For the love of God.
[202:53.80]Shit.
[202:59.96]This is not the right way to do this.
[203:07.02]This is incorrect.
[203:16.17]Don't fall.
[203:21.97]No lip, no lip, no lip chat, come on.
[203:35.60]Something's not right.
[203:39.94]Something's not right here.
[203:44.91]There we go.
[203:45.85]Oh dear.
[203:48.59]Alright, we're up here.
[203:50.83]Now what do we need to do?
[203:51.59]We need to go to that one.
[203:56.53]Almost there.
[203:58.49]Almost there.
[204:00.89]We did this in the absolute worst roundabout way possible.
[204:15.14]I didn't shoot enough ropes.
[204:17.88]That's what happened.
[204:26.28]Don't give me any lip.
[204:27.91]I see people in the chat looking like they're trying... My tummy hurts.
[204:45.47]Get the fuck out of here, man.
[204:47.59]Give me a fucking... Don't give me any... Don't give me any lip!
[204:56.50]I need to shoot more.
[205:07.05]My stomach actually hurts.
[205:10.83]My stomach actually hurts.
[205:13.99]Get up there.
[205:14.87]Come on, man.
[205:15.95]All of a sudden, he's just okay with it.
[205:29.60]Climb up it.
[205:31.14]I just might need to shoot another couple right there.
[205:33.53]Ugh!
[205:34.73]Ugh!
[205:46.34]Get the fuck out of here.
[205:47.96]Get off of this.
[205:49.52]Get off of it.
[205:50.97]Just leave it.
[205:53.01]Stop it.
[205:53.61]I can't get off.
[205:55.35]I want to get off the ride, man.
[205:57.29]Just get me off the ride.
[205:58.85]All you have to do is get off the ride.
[205:59.91]I don't want to grab the rope again.
[206:07.37]Good riddance.
[206:11.65]We'll have to do something about it.
[206:16.83]Get me out.
[206:17.41]Get me out of here.
[206:19.65]Now what?
[206:20.49]Escape.
[206:21.43]We have to, like, launch something out here?
[206:47.77]Okay, what was that noise?
[206:48.89]Alright, we're just gonna do the- we're just running out of the demon.
[206:51.75]Forget it.
[206:54.69]Just get me out of here.
[206:58.93]We're just gonna demon run.
[207:02.69]Oh, where am I?
[207:03.63]What is this?
[207:04.99]What happened?
[207:09.59]I'm like up here now.
[207:15.03]There's an item over there.
[207:16.09]I don't think I care.
[207:30.42]Where's the sword?
[207:32.92]What's going on?
[207:33.86]Oh.
[207:34.70]Okay.
[207:41.50]Sword and shield.
[207:43.68]I am prepared.
[207:48.44]Exit.
[207:52.26]There's no clip to get the item.
[207:53.64]No.
[207:54.06]I'm out.
[207:54.62]I'm running out of here.
[207:59.72]Now I really am a Dark Souls character.
[208:06.02]Alright, the next stopping point, I'm gonna call the stream for tonight.
[208:11.71]I think I'm getting there soon.
[208:20.58]Oh, wait a minute now.
[208:22.98]The goblins scream like that too?
[208:28.18]Oh man, I think I know what we have to do next time.
[208:38.43]Get me the fuck out of here.
[208:43.15]Oh, I just fucked him up.
[208:44.83]Best weapon in the game.
[208:49.91]Like, this thing is just unbelievable.
[208:51.49]I'm glad I used this thing.
[208:53.69]What a mistake it was to not have this immediately.
[209:06.74]I'm just beating the fucking absolute bag out of these guys.
[209:09.90]Got some garlic, some bananas.
[209:15.84]Open the gate.
[209:16.26]Alright, I gotta free this guy.
[209:25.15]I would love to do that.
[209:25.85]I don't know where... Oh, here it is.
[209:26.61]Okay, come on out and help.
[209:36.04]I don't give a fuck anything that guy says.
[209:38.30]It's time to go.
[209:38.86]We're not waiting for dialog.
[209:52.85]I don't have time for this.
[209:57.74]Do you think I have any time in the world for this shit?
[210:04.27]That guy just jumped off and died.
[210:06.51]Where am I going?
[210:07.37]What's happening?
[210:09.53]Dude, this thing is insane.
[210:10.55]You just sweep people like fucking toast on the ground.
[210:12.77]Down?
[210:15.23]Down?
[210:38.74]That was fucking meaningless.
[210:40.18]Nothing over there.
[210:43.66]Just let me out.
[210:44.56]Let me out of the castle.
[210:50.36]Just put me against the boss.
[210:56.16]I can't hit this guy.
[210:56.94]He's too small.
[210:57.70]He ducked.
[211:02.18]He ducked.
[211:02.64]You know what?
[211:03.08]Whatever.
[211:06.63]They're just too small.
[211:11.29]What else is going on now?
[211:18.31]I just want to get out of here.
[211:19.49]Up there?
[211:19.79]I think I have to jump.
[211:22.88]Oh, God.
[211:23.62]This is where the... What the fuck was that?
[211:35.87]What was that explosion?
[211:40.52]Nothing in here.
[211:41.04]Chest.
[211:47.08]The orc would have told me how to get out of here.
[211:54.46]Oh, my stomach hurts.
[211:56.34]Here it is.
[211:56.82]I can just turn this, right?
[211:59.48]The orc was going to tell me how to leave.
[212:04.61]Oh, that's so fucking ironic.
[212:07.55]If I only had listened to the orc.
[212:23.32]What did that do?
[212:25.80]Climb!
[212:35.12]Other side of the valve thing, I know.
[212:36.50]I'm just a fucking idiot.
[212:37.72]Alright, that's that.
[212:42.69]Quest saved.
[212:43.45]We just have to do a bunch of dumb jumps.
[212:45.19]This is why nobody fucking makes games.
[212:51.35]This is why nobody makes a game for the fucking Source Engine.
[212:53.91]Okay?
[213:01.08]Slow down.
[213:06.46]What is that?
[213:14.11]So ascension's rad.
[213:16.18]I'm just being facetious.
[213:19.68]But really though, how do I get out of here?
[213:52.07]Okay, I didn't have to go that high.
[213:53.89]There was shit up there.
[213:54.71]I don't care.
[213:56.85]Wait, is this?
[213:57.23]Okay, keep going.
[214:04.44]Did I make it?
[214:04.90]Use the rope?
[214:07.12]Oh, there was no wood.
[214:07.82]There's no wood there, man.
[214:11.06]You have to use the special no-clip strategy.
[214:28.22]Just the rope bong.
[214:29.56]I thought you had to do this shit on wood.
[214:45.97]Down?
[214:51.56]I thought that was a fucking spider.
[214:52.92]I was about to scream.
[214:53.88]I guess we go down.
[215:03.03]How long is the stream going to be?
[215:03.99]It's going to be until I get to another stopping point.
[215:07.69]When I get out of this castle.
[215:09.99]Oh, please, dude.
[215:15.69]I stuck a rope in that guy's bow.
[215:23.04]You guys don't even stand a fucking chance.
[215:24.70]I love it.
[215:28.68]I like to scream.
[215:30.34]I don't like to scream.
[215:31.18]I like to threaten to scream.
[215:34.55]Sometimes you gotta have a threat that you're going to do something, but you just don't do it.
[215:38.83]Everything's okay.
[215:39.27]Dude, I'm gonna make an egg salad sandwich.
[215:43.43]You guys like egg salad?
[215:46.81]How delicious is, like, a good toasted egg salad sandwich?
[215:50.86]Talk about, like, a scale of 1 to 10.
[215:51.74]Talk about, like, at least an 8.
[215:54.44]At the very least.
[215:59.46]Now we're into The Last Guardian part of the game.

[222:37.82]The day in the life of Jerma985 is pretty simple.
[222:40.86]We eat egg salad sandwiches.
[222:43.48]Every day.
[222:44.80]At least two egg salad sandwiches.
[222:47.46]We watch a little bit of TV.
[222:51.54]And then we go to bed.
[222:52.78]Okay, you're freaking me out.
[222:55.60]That thing was just being weird, right?
[222:57.83]But anyways, next one's super... I thought the tree was a giant open mouth.

[223:53.38]Dark magic.
[224:00.17]Get up there.
[224:01.92]And I need to just jump and grab onto the edge.
[224:05.29]But for some reason, it's just not easy.
[224:06.91]It's not easy to do that, apparently.
[224:08.41]Let me just get to the end point of this.
[224:13.73]There's a lot of stuff in there.
[224:14.69]Holy shit.
[224:16.03]That was actually really good.
[224:26.10]We're good.
[224:30.94]Or are we good?
[224:34.32]Do I just have to get up there?
[224:36.90]Up to that thing?
[224:40.06]Well, looks like we're just going here.
[224:41.32]Do I need to... I don't get what's happening right now.
[224:53.74]I just gotta... Get the fuck away from me.
[225:04.79]Oh, my God.
[225:05.45]Like, I probably shouldn't be doing this right now, but I don't have any other explanation as to where the fuck I'm... Get... Get up!

[225:44.36]I have to jump up to the rope.
[225:45.95]I have to get up to the jump to that rope right there.
[226:02.60]Get me the fuck up here.
[226:16.53]Is somebody else throwing shit at me?
[226:23.47]Fuck off!
[226:24.93]We're kicking you off the fucking edge.
[226:26.37]No, we're gonna make the barrel do it.
[226:27.51]Oh, I'm like, what?
[226:29.01]You wanna get respected?
[226:36.32]Oh, no!

[226:59.69]There's your excuse.
[227:01.75]I'm tired and I'm a little hungry.
[227:06.09]It's alright.
[227:06.51]I know exactly what to do.
[227:10.01]Just get up there and pick up the fucking stuff on the ground and then go.
[227:13.48]Or no clip.
[227:14.22]Either one will work for me right now.
[227:18.24]Arcane robe, ring of fire protection.
[227:22.06]Something else.
[227:27.46]Or is there something else?
[227:31.42]I guess there is some other stuff here.
[227:32.62]Oh, I gotta start leaving these scrolls.
[227:36.94]All they're doing is pain.
[227:43.65]But what was all the way up top?
[227:49.47]What was up?
[227:50.19]Did I miss something up all the way up?

[228:45.06]I'm getting rid of this.
[228:47.76]I have to start dumping shit.
[228:51.14]Get this out of here.
[228:52.00]I don't like that.
[228:52.70]I don't know what these things are.

[229:06.11]I'm never going to use the bow ever again for any reason.
[229:11.80]It's a poison bow.
[229:12.74]Get it out of here.
[229:14.20]It's not even that cool.
[229:16.26]Shadow steel daggers.
[229:17.20]I'm not going to do stealth three.
[229:20.88]Maybe another playthrough.
[229:22.30]I'm using this.
[229:22.92]I'm going to use this eventually.
[229:25.98]With strength three.
[229:30.47]Can I put?
[229:30.89]No, I can't.
[229:31.49]Strength three.
[229:31.93]We're going to throw this on.
[229:32.67]This is plus nine and then eighteen.
[229:33.89]Eighteen.
[229:36.40]So this thing's gonna be good.
[229:39.60]Another playthrough, LOL.

[233:40.07]And then... Maybe if you... Like, anybody that has this game...
[233:45.37]Like, I'm gonna just do some research and see if the multiplayer even still works.
[233:49.81]And then if I finish the game and there's still, like, you know, an hour or two that I'd like to play... Maybe we can all just jump into a random fucking Dark Messiah multiplayer session.
[233:59.14]And just jump in.
[234:01.84]Oh, but I'm starving.
[234:02.62]I haven't eaten anything in a very long time.

[235:42.16]It looked like it was fun.
[235:43.10]Had some interesting moments, potentially.
[235:45.79]So that's the game we're going to be playing on Thursday.
[235:48.35]Into maybe Friday if I'm having fun and it's a good game.
[235:51.21]It might just suck.
[235:51.95]Who knows?
[235:52.29]It could be good, though.
[235:55.29]Anyways, thank you so much, EveSync.
[235:56.69]Thanks also to Spectag.
[235:57.76]Mostly lost Chipley for $10.
[235:59.70]Chipley gave $10 a long time ago.
[236:02.90]Thanks for the great content over the years, even if you are a compact streamer.
[236:08.19]Well, thank you.
[236:08.81]I appreciate it.
[236:19.72]I will admit I was losing my mind there at that point when we were swimming underwater.
[236:23.94]I couldn't fucking handle it.
[236:25.64]And I admit that.
[236:26.36]Sometimes you have to admit your mistakes, and my mistake was not having a brightness set.
[236:31.20]No, I'm not gonna drag the devs into this.
[236:33.05]It's my fault.
[236:34.80]Thanks a lot, Gummy.
[236:35.80]Scarlo, thanks for the $5.
[236:37.18]Still getting tea.
[236:38.10]Yeah, I remember that one.
[236:39.38]That was annoying.
[236:40.00]I'm sorry.
[236:41.76]Thanks a lot, guys.
[236:43.88]See you not... Yes, tomorrow.
[236:48.27]Okay, my brain's freaking out.
[236:50.27]See you tomorrow.
[236:51.71]We're gonna try to finish this.
[236:54.11]Have fun.
[236:54.79]Take care.
[236:55.87]Good night, everybody.
[237:09.68]Thank you.
