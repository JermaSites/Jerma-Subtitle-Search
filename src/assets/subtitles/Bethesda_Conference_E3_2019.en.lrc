[00:01.38]I'll put it on screen so you don't miss anything.
[00:04.16]Where is it, where is it?
[00:04.64]Okay, come on, come on.
[00:06.20]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[00:09.36]I can't miss this.
[00:09.98]And then it's in bed.
[00:23.33]Did it work?
[00:29.05]Alright, just you watch that, I'll be right back, I gotta pee.
[00:43.20]Why is it doing this?
[00:45.90]Is it broken?
[00:52.55]Wrong stream?
[00:56.19]Which is it just Bethesda?
[00:57.83]Direction.
[00:59.25]Yes.
[00:59.71]No, I agree.
[01:00.87]That's exactly what I want to believe.
[01:02.65]That's a big problem.
[01:04.78]Imagine walking out and saying, we do have two more surprises.
[01:07.50]And the crowd goes, oh.
[01:08.78]Take a look at this.
[01:09.44]This is a plane.
[01:13.49]Oh, my God.
[01:14.07]Just give me this.
[01:15.38]Alright.
[01:16.10]I'll be right back.
[01:16.80]Just relax.
[01:18.70]I'll be right back.
[01:21.14]Man, I feel like if we're going to dream, we got to be dreaming like way bigger.
[01:24.50]Okay.
[01:24.62]I got something.
[01:25.14]I got something.
[01:26.06]Do it.
[01:26.36]Do it.
[01:27.54]Bethesda seems they've done a good job at sometimes like pulling these surprises out, right?
[01:33.52]Even Fallout 76, I think, was like kind of a surprise.
[01:36.13]Yeah.
[01:36.47]What if we saw a Bethesda who has many awesome worlds?
[01:40.67]What if we saw...
[01:42.38]Bethesda Auto Chess.
[01:45.76]Wow.
[01:46.15]Here's the thing, Marcus, we're just going back and forth.
[01:49.45]We're apparently less than a minute, so your final thoughts.
[01:51.81]We're just naming games we enjoy and asking Bethesda.
[01:54.67]Can you make Pok√©mon Snap Bethesda, please?
[01:58.66]I would love a Shinra made by Bethesda.
[02:02.00]The Wishing Well.
[02:03.24]I want Rio to start just off.
[02:04.94]Wow, it's Bethesda.
[02:08.09]I think Elder Scrolls Online.
[02:11.13]What?
[02:11.97]Yeah.
[02:12.83]We'll see a little bit more about that.
[02:14.09]They released earlier their lineup for this year.
[02:17.51]Evil Within 3.
[02:20.08]Be together.
[02:22.24]That is what we are about to be for the Bethesda E3 showcase right here, E3 on Twitch.
[02:27.87]It is day one, 2019.
[02:30.05]We still have so much coming at you this entire week.
[02:33.27]We hope that you will enjoy this next press conference.
[02:35.69]We'll be back afterwards for the post-press conference, or we won't.
[02:38.31]You'll be with Drop Frames.
[02:39.27]You'll find out.
[02:40.08]When that actually happens, don't forget we also got Devolver and the pre-pre-show.
[02:43.96]Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the next press conference of day number one.
[02:47.48]But don't forget, we have just got started.
[02:49.44]It is time now for Bethesda.
[03:11.17]Thank you.
[03:41.06]With a game, there is no game without the players.
[03:44.82]Really, it all comes down to you.
[03:50.08]Without you, there is no game.
[03:52.45]There's no one to play it.
[03:53.53]No one to interact with it.
[03:57.33]You keep us in check.
[03:59.87]And we appreciate that.
[04:05.01]And through all of it... You're always there with us.
[04:08.60]Damn it, man.
[04:09.16]I pissed all over the toilet.
[04:10.62]I had to clean it up.
[04:11.70]It was bad.
[04:13.78]It was out of control.
[04:15.76]It wouldn't stop.
[04:19.13]You empathize with us as developers and with each other as a community.
[04:23.89]It's really beautiful.
[04:28.72]And I used to take a week off every time Bethesda game came out.
[04:32.22]My name is Mark Diaz, and when I was eight years old, I used to sneak over to my buddy's house to play Doom.
[04:37.86]I'm Rich Lambert.
[04:38.82]Daggerfall was one of the very first games that got me into The Elder Scrolls world.
[04:42.70]I'm Xena Christo, and I started out as a 16-year-old gamer who just wanted to bring joy to others through video games.
[04:48.83]And now I'm game director at Arkane Studios.
[04:51.13]Now I'm a game programmer.
[04:52.95]Now I get to be a part of building that world as the creative director on Elder Scrolls Online.
[04:57.61]Now I'm a UI programmer at Bethesda Game Studios, and it's everything I could have dreamed of.
[05:02.38]I see you.
[05:03.18]I see you.
[05:05.88]We see you because we are you.
[05:07.68]And together.
[05:09.28]Together.
[05:09.84]Together.
[05:10.38]We are all.
[05:11.20]We are all.
[05:11.94]We are all.
[05:12.68]We are all.
[05:13.34]We are all.
[05:14.24]We are all the best.
[05:23.70]It's Andrew WK.
[05:25.04]Party, party, party.
[05:26.08]It's time.
[05:26.72]Right?
[05:49.23]I got you, I got you, I got you
[06:26.94]that was three games yes thank you one of them nobody likes here he comes
[06:56.08]Thank you.
[06:58.52]Thank you very much.
[06:59.26]How are you?
[07:00.40]Feel good?
[07:01.62]Yeah.
[07:03.41]Awesome.
[07:04.45]Thank you guys for being here.
[07:05.59]Thank everyone watching around the world for tuning in to watch our fifth annual E3 showcase.
[07:13.89]You're welcome.
[07:14.81]We're here for you.
[07:15.51]This is a night dedicated to those who love games, who love the incredible entertainment that games provide.
[07:21.94]This past year, you fought demons on Mars and Nazis in America.
[07:26.27]You were assassins in the Empire, adventurers in Tamriel, and survivors in the wasteland.
[07:37.27]And you've embarked on these amazing adventures on PC, console, VR, mobile, or wherever and however you choose to play.
[07:44.76]And that's the key.
[07:46.06]You take the worlds that we create, and you make them yours.
[07:49.61]You share your experiences with other players, with friends, and with family.
[07:54.28]With our games, you've built large global communities that truly matter.
[07:59.74]This year, we want to give special recognition to the extraordinary Bethesda community.
[08:04.10]As you saw in our opening video, you mean everything to us.
[08:08.74]I've almost been at this company for 20 years.
[08:11.92]And when I first started... I do?
[08:14.84]Oh, I mean everything?
[08:24.68]When I first started, one of my first responsibilities was moderating the community forums, chatting with you and keeping you up to date on our games.
[08:32.09]It was a great way to start my career at Bethesda because it was the perfect reminder of why we do what we do.
[08:38.09]And like so many others at Bethesda, I've spent a lot of time with you at events around the world.
[08:42.44]Is that him?
[08:43.38]Is that him from like 20 years ago?
[08:45.52]Oh, at first, alright, never mind.
[08:47.36]I thought it was like, hey, this is what I used to do in the Bethesda community.
[08:52.02]We are thrilled tonight to show our fans the lineup of great games we've been creating just for you, including the premiere of some exciting new games.
[09:00.87]And we'll go deep on Doom Eternal.
[09:05.71]Stop.
[09:06.09]Stop cheering.
[09:10.52]They didn't see anything yet.
[09:13.26]If you're ready, let's kick it off.
[09:15.02]And to get an update from our friends at one of the most celebrated development studios in the world, Bethesda Game Studios.
[09:21.22]Please welcome studio head and my good friend, Todd Howard.
[09:24.74]I can't even look at him.
[09:28.74]I can't even look at the screen.
[09:30.93]Is he there?
[09:35.05]Is he there yet?
[09:36.93]Tell me when he's there.
[09:40.27]Thank you.
[09:41.87]Thank you.
[09:44.04]Great to see everybody.
[09:45.26]Hey, Todd.
[09:46.94]We have had an incredibly exciting year at Bethesda Game Studios.
[09:52.10]Given some of that excitement impressed, you're still here.
[10:01.16]Actually, over the last year, we've had over 60 million players in our games, our most ever.
[10:08.85]And it's all of you
[10:17.93]Am I drunk?
[10:18.79]It's all of you who have made these worlds what they are.
[10:23.65]Take Fallout 76.
[10:24.99]Alright.
[10:25.39]This is a good one.
[10:33.67]A type of game we'd never done before.
[10:36.99]Had a lot of difficulties at launch.
[10:40.97]Like this.
[10:41.81]A lot of well-deserved criticism.
[10:51.65]and you kept playing it and through all of that something amazing has happened it's thanks to all of you this game has one of the best online communities we've ever seen it's me my mom my grandma and everybody's nice to each other they don't go on killing griefing sprees they leave food and water for the newbies and wave to each other I don't know about you
[11:20.02]Come on!
[11:21.57]I paid good money for these seats!
[11:22.87]To you.
[11:28.26]And we have a lot more in store this year for Fallout 76.
[11:31.59]But first, our latest game, The Elder Scrolls Blades, is in early access.
[11:36.89]And thanks to all of you, it became our second straight number one mobile game after Fallout Shelter.
[11:44.05]Absolutely incredible.
[11:45.18]This is the only game I've ever played in my life.
[11:47.40]I'm not kidding.
[11:47.84]This is a full, real statement.
[11:50.78]Within 25 minutes, the iPad hit me almost in the face because I fell asleep.
[11:57.76]I fell asleep playing the game.
[11:59.46]I actually went to bed.
[12:00.69]Like, I went, I passed out asleep and the iPad went, like, right on my deck, almost hit me on the chin.
[12:06.27]I've never done that before.
[12:08.89]It's really good sleep, baby.
[12:09.67]I didn't even get past the tutorial.
[12:11.19]It might be good.
[12:11.73]I don't know.
[12:12.15]I keep going to bed.
[12:12.75]We still love those classic dungeon crawlers, and it's clear you do as well.
[12:27.06]And whether you're exploring a dungeon or rebuilding your town, it's great to be able to do it wherever you are.
[12:32.47]Since it's E3, we're releasing our biggest update yet, featuring all new jobs and solo arena battles.
[12:40.05]We're getting more jobs here.
[12:44.63]What you understand is the unemployment rate in The Elder Scrolls Blades is by far the lowest it's ever been.
[12:52.34]It has even more, but best of all, it's coming out tonight.
[13:00.63]So download free tonight and give it a try.
[13:06.16]And we're also hard at work on our arena mode for this fall that will feature PvP, your own guilds, and visiting your friends' towns.
[13:14.48]But most exciting this year, we're also bringing Blades to an all-new platform.
[13:19.06]Switch Blades.
[13:27.17]Hey, what?
[13:27.99]Who cares?
[13:37.49]You know what I mean?
[13:38.23]If you were going to play this, you would have played it on your phone.
[13:40.45]Everybody has a phone.
[13:41.19]What, you guys don't have phones?
[13:48.00]Right?
[13:48.22]Yeah.
[13:50.18]Thank you.
[14:00.16]Is this the new Skyrim?
[14:01.28]Are they going to release this like 12 times?
[14:02.54]Yes, Blaze is coming this fall from the Nintendo Switch, and yes, it's still free.
[14:08.55]Oh, thank God.
[14:09.49]If it was money, I would have been upset about that.
[14:14.12]You can play on the go, on your TV, and with motion controls.
[14:18.36]But best of all, it's cross-play and cross-progression with the mobile version.
[14:24.92]So you can start connecting on mobile and all your progress will carry over.
[14:29.89]And it's playable here at E3 in our booth and Nintendo's.
[14:34.51]Between my iPhone and my Switch?
[14:37.89]Oh!
[14:39.55]Help!
[14:39.87]Somebody help!
[14:41.09]It's nice to be playing on mobile.
[14:42.47]We also have some special rewards for both our Apple and Google players this week.
[14:46.39]So download tonight and let us know what you think.
[14:49.23]Thanks again.
[14:55.62]now let me introduce jeff and Tom to tell you what's coming to fallout 76. there are some really excited people here hi I'm project leader jeff gardner and I'm co-studio director Tom mustang
[15:19.22]On behalf of everyone at Bethesda Game Studios, we want to thank the millions of you who have played with us, stuck with us, and helped shape the world of Fallout 76.
[15:33.55]Absolutely.
[15:34.91]It's incredible what the game has become.
[15:37.77]You've told us how much you've loved this year's updates so far, from camp building, legendary weapons, player vending, and of course, the dreaded Sheep Squatch.
[15:48.82]We've also been working on our biggest update yet.
[15:53.07]It's called Wastelanders.
[15:55.55]And it will fundamentally change the game.
[15:59.15]All I remember is Rick and Morty played this.
[16:02.35]That's it.
[16:02.67]I don't know anything about it.
[16:03.51]I don't know anything else about it.
[16:05.13]It's been some time since Vault 76 opened its door.
[16:07.85]They did a Rick and Morty play this game.
[16:09.79]We all discovered that Appalachia isn't quite what it used to be.
[16:12.42]I'll get out of the way.
[16:13.46]We encountered a lot of things.
[16:15.44]Some people are interested.
[16:17.04]Overcame a lot of things.
[16:20.64]I don't think any of us expected for people.
[16:24.88]to actually come back.
[16:27.34]Are you from that vault?
[16:30.02]Can you help us?
[16:33.58]We've traveled pretty far.
[16:35.15]Heard there's hope here in Appalachia.
[16:39.41]Folk rebuilding.
[16:41.05]Nobody cares?
[16:44.05]We'll fight too.
[16:45.59]Do you think this is like a giant AstroTurf?
[16:49.29]Didn't he say there was like a million players?
[16:51.37]We've been everywhere and seen everything.
[16:55.10]And the one thing we've learned is this.
[16:57.74]You've got to claim the wasteland before it claims you.
[17:04.45]The question is, are you with us or them?
[17:17.64]You think this pumped-in crowd sounds?
[17:27.92]That's right.
[17:28.94]That's right.
[17:30.00]Human NPCs are coming to Fallout 76.
[17:32.10]Heck yeah!
[17:38.16]Not just NPCs, but a full quest line, new rewards, and as you saw, full dialog trees.
[17:50.32]This is a long-term story we're telling.
[17:52.74]It's like a rock concert.
[17:53.44]Year one was about the Vault doors opening and all of you settling the Wasteland.
[17:58.58]Year two is about people coming back to reclaim it.
[18:02.60]Like previous Fallout games, these characters have their own stories and goals.
[18:07.07]It's up to you to choose how to interact with them and live with those consequences.
[18:11.97]The Wastelanders update is coming this fall and will be free for all Fallout 76 players.
[18:17.51]Fall?
[18:20.12]It's kind of a ways away.
[18:25.89]And in the spirit of free, we're doing something special just for E3.
[18:30.12]Fallout 76 is going to have a free trial for everyone starting tomorrow.
[18:34.76]It's free for a week.
[18:38.01]And let me tell you what we're doing at Fallout 76.
[18:41.03]It's going free for one week.
[18:44.00]Fallout 76 and its growing community have become.
[18:47.26]We can't wait to welcome all of you.
[18:50.18]And because so many of you are going to be joining us, we thought we'd also give you a sneak peek this week at an all-new game mode.
[18:58.99]Check it out.
[19:10.04]Your first test was making it to the vault.
[19:12.68]Now, your real trial begins.
[19:15.92]I wouldn't be surprised.
[19:16.60]I really wouldn't.
[19:20.33]Perhaps you will be the one.
[19:25.55]Nuclear winter.
[19:26.65]We are in serious need of leadership, so I have devised a unique process of elimination.
[19:37.50]this is what we call a in the industry a pivot
[20:35.83]Fallout 76 pivoted to a VR game mode.
[20:55.02]And just like Fortnite, it'll probably be the only thing that anyone plays.
[21:01.04]You can say, fuck yeah.
[21:05.35]That's right.
[21:06.07]Nuclear Winner is a battle royale born from the Fallout universe.
[21:10.08]From power armor to perk cards, from camp building to contending with wasteland creatures, and of course my personal favorite, nukes.
[21:19.23]It's a great free addition to an already huge game.
[21:23.03]We love playing it and we think you will too.
[21:29.36]That guy wasn't excited, that guy got burnt.
[21:31.85]That guy dropped a cigarette on his lap.
[21:32.79]Somebody took their bare feet, took their shoes off and put their ice cold bare feet on that guy's back.
[21:36.45]Fucking VR mode.
[22:01.62]Remember, everything we've talked about that's coming this year is free.
[22:07.17]I like that jacket.
[22:07.99]We get to represent hundreds of passionate developers across four studio locations in North America working on multiple projects.
[22:17.15]Yes, we're still hard at work on our next-gen RPG, Starfield.
[22:21.67]And of course, Elder Scrolls VI.
[22:27.42]Yeah, me too.
[22:28.52]I like that one.
[22:30.05]We know how precious these game worlds are to all of you, and they are to us.
[22:36.93]We know the time you spend in them is important.
[22:40.70]Keep telling us what you love, what you'd like to see us do better.
[22:44.48]Thank you again, everybody, for your support.
[22:47.34]But really, even more so, I want to thank everybody for believing in us.
[22:51.56]Thank you.
[22:53.70]Is that the end?
[22:56.85]Is that the end?
[22:57.21]Please welcome the founder of Tango Gameworks, Mr. Shinji Mikami.
[23:03.44]I was going to say, that's not very good.
[23:20.46]Tango?
[23:20.88]What's Tango Gameworks?
[23:22.62]What do they do?
[23:23.91]I'd like to start by greeting my team in Tokyo.
[23:27.73]Tango Gameworks.
[23:28.71]What do they make?
[23:29.39]It's Monday morning there, but they are watching.
[23:32.77]Evil Within.
[23:33.29]Oh.
[23:33.89]Evil Within.
[23:37.13]I didn't... I am not a big... If you don't know this about the channel, I'm really not a big fan of that game.
[23:45.82]I am excited to announce the next game from Tango.
[23:51.44]Ghostwire, Tokyo.
[23:53.68]Ghostwire.
[23:56.26]Hold on.
[23:56.70]Wait, wait.
[23:57.32]We got something.
[23:58.48]This is new.
[23:59.70]This is new.
[24:00.20]Let's hold the judgments here.
[24:02.24]Hold on.
[24:04.42]It is an action-adventure game in which you will fight paranormal enemies and rid the city of supernatural evil.
[24:14.25]I think you'll love it.
[24:15.95]Okay.
[24:21.87]That guy definitely has, like, a fucking camera pointed at him.
[24:27.19]He's gonna upload it later.
[24:34.47]Come on!
[24:36.03]This ain't even Cox doing this.
[24:37.35]This is just a bad feed.
[24:40.67]Alright, let's see what... I'm intrigued.
[24:44.03]I'm very intrigued.
[24:46.69]I'm very intrigued about this.
[24:47.88]Thank you.
[24:48.44]Arigato gozaimasu.
[24:54.69]And such a big stage makes me nervous.
[24:59.85]I'll do my best to speak in English.
[25:02.11]It's hard to do.
[25:09.05]It's hard to do.
[25:10.89]We are making a new kind of action adventure game.
[25:14.95]It's spooky.
[25:17.49]But not the survival horror game that we are known for.
[25:22.39]People are vanishing in Tokyo.
[25:25.55]You must find out why.
[25:28.41]You will encounter conspiracies and the occult.
[25:33.47]You have to explore the world, face challenges to uncover the truth and save humanity.
[25:43.42]In the game, you will meet spirits, some dangerous, some peaceful.
[25:50.63]And survivors that each have their own stories.
[25:55.15]You will need to ask yourself.
[25:58.02]It is normal or paranormal?
[26:01.00]This is Men in Black?
[26:02.12]This is Men in Black.
[26:03.80]The aliens are among us.
[26:04.96]And you have to find out who's an alien or who's a ghost.

[29:00.04]I've been a Doom fan since the game came out.
[29:02.44]I remember being in the eighth grade and a buddy of mine giving me the shareware demo on three and a half inch floppy disks.
[29:09.10]My older brother picked up Fallout 3 and I took his copy and played it when he wasn't home.
[29:13.94]Fallout 4, ugh, you guys.
[29:17.86]The scope of that game was just like a lot bigger than things I was used to.
[29:22.41]Just setting foot in Shimmering, the first city that you go to in Somerset, it was amazing.
[29:29.54]You would look out and you'd be like, oh, I want to go there.
[29:32.72]And then you could go there, which was wild.
[29:35.76]Go out into the world, go in any direction that you want to go.
[29:38.87]The exploration and the weirdness and the alien-ness of it.
[29:42.47]I played Oblivion.
[29:43.39]I tell you, it probably saved my life.
[29:45.45]It was one of my first experiences with a fantasy world that was that immersive.
[29:50.83]Love the dragons, scatter the dragons.
[29:52.77]You take down a dragon, you can definitely take down any illness.
[29:56.20]Don't ever stop adding dragons to your game.

[30:00.26]Add dragons to Rage.
[30:01.34]Add dragons to everything.

[30:53.41]I mean, I don't mean any disrespect by this at all.
[30:55.09]I thought they shut this off.
[30:56.93]I thought they shut the servers off.
[30:58.17]Like two years ago.
[30:58.63]That this wasn't it?
[31:07.63]Still popular?
[31:08.33]If it's fun, then it's fun, right?
[31:29.53]Thank you.
[31:30.49]Thank you for making ESO the extraordinary adventure it is today.
[31:34.87]The past year has been a huge success for ESO.
[31:38.06]More Game of the Year awards, millions more players have joined.
[31:43.02]So many, in fact, that we recently added more server capacity just to support all the new players in Tamriel.
[31:53.07]I just want to make sure we say can I just say this can we please stop serving alcohol before the show's getting bigger and better come on just a few days ago we launched The Elder Scrolls online elsewhere the latest chapter the latest chapter in the game where you're able to visit for the first time the homeland of the khajiit as well as control the dead as the new necromancer class
[32:17.30]And if you haven't played yet, elsewhere is the perfect starting point for new players.
[32:26.74]When we announced Season of the Dragon, we kicked it off by showing you a video about how dragons were unleashed on Elsewhere.
[32:33.64]And we ended with a cliffhanger.
[32:35.26]I feel like that guy doesn't have a shirt on.
[32:36.40]I'm really excited to show you what happens next.
[32:38.74]I feel like that guy has, like, a football kind of logo painted on his chest.
[32:43.68]And he's got, like, a full paint on his face.
[32:46.14]He's got, like, horns on.
[32:47.04]He's just screaming in the crowd.
[33:48.17]I was like, what is going on?
[33:51.64]It's just a cat.
[33:54.46]I forgot this was Elder Scrolls.
[34:43.38]Nice.
[34:44.70]Got him with the umbrella.
[34:48.64]Thief.
[35:13.00]Oh, magnificent Smaug.
[35:15.61]Your impressive body is none other than I could ever see before.
[36:10.74]Nice.
[36:11.40]Dude, that was so awesome.
[36:33.29]Why don't we take a look and see how that scenario would play out in the actual game?
[36:39.87]Whoa!
[36:54.86]That's right, another cliffhanger.
[36:57.82]You may have recognized the return of Sai Sahan, the legendary Redguard Swordmaster.
[37:03.54]He's the legendary Redguard swordmaster you met as part of the original five companions.
[37:07.95]He's back as the leader of the Dragon Guard, a group of dragon hunting warriors you've seen in other Elder Scrolls games.
[37:15.71]He'll be featured in our fourth quarter story DLC named Dragonhold, which will complete the season of the dragon.
[37:24.98]We've got a lot more to share about the return of Sai and the Dragon Guard, which will unveil at QuakeCon later this summer.
[37:31.72]Guy's gonna call his mom later and be like, Mom, Mom, it's been wild.
[37:37.44]Sorry, I got Larry Knight.
[37:39.04]I've been fucking screaming.
[37:40.26]They need to introduce two new dragons.
[37:42.79]They introduced this cat, this new cat.
[37:44.31]I can't believe it.
[37:45.77]Alright, I'll talk to you later.
[37:46.55]Love you, Mom.
[37:46.85]Thank you so much for your support of The Elder Scrolls Online.
[37:49.71]We're humbled by your enthusiasm.
[37:51.79]Your enthusiasm for the game motivates us every day.
[37:55.27]You guys are seriously awesome.
[37:56.89]Thank you.
[37:57.29]Woo!
[38:00.92]Dust is going to start coming out of this guy's throat.
[38:02.54]I'm concerned for this dude's health.
[38:04.52]He's going to be like coughing up sand.
[38:08.92]The Elder Scrolls Online isn't the only game in development at ZeniMax Online Studios.
[38:13.86]We have several other projects, one of which we're ready to reveal tonight.
[38:20.77]And to tell us all about it is the game's creative director, Kira Schlitt.
[38:25.91]New game.
[38:28.91]Alright, new game.
[38:34.44]Yarn Free, whatever it's called.
[38:37.52]What?
[38:37.74]Saturday morning mobile free to...
[39:02.30]Commander King.
[39:04.26]Commander King.
[39:05.34]Commander King.
[39:13.19]When evil comes from outer space.
[39:25.89]This feels like a fake game trailer.
[39:27.75]This is going to be like another reveal.
[39:31.64]This is a beta, I think.
[39:44.23]Didn't it feel kind of like it was going to bleed into something else?
[39:48.03]That it was going to be like... I mean, Commander Keen, whatever.
[39:52.79]So there's a new branch on Commander Keen's family tree, and they're heading to iOS and Android.
[39:59.32]If you're hearing about Commander Keen for the first time, it was one of the first PC action games created by id Software in the early 90s.
[40:06.36]Yeah.
[40:08.01]Right.
[40:11.20]it starred boy genius Billy blaze whose alter ego commander king protected oh I thought it was like all of us at zenimax online studios want to give a really big thanks to our friends at id for trusting us to deliver our modern take on this classic game
[40:32.84]So tonight, as we introduce Commander Keen to a new generation of players, we're also introducing the next generation of heroes.
[40:41.81]Meet Billy.
[40:42.41]Billy Keen.
[40:44.75]Billy and Billy Keen.
[40:46.93]Twin geniuses who follow in their famous father's footsteps.
[40:50.91]The new commanders are, of course, funny and powerful, but the game is also full of enemies, allies, and some really bad bad guys.
[41:00.81]The twins build wacky gadgets from household items to save the Earth from certain alien destruction.
[41:07.40]Drag and drop gadgets to summon allies, attack enemies, and move through the environment.
[41:13.54]Choose from a caboodle of contraptions to conquer challenges.
[41:16.73]And try saying that five times fast.
[41:19.51]The tones go on adventures in story mode, which tells some of the classic Commander Keen tales as well as a whole bunch of brand new ones.
[41:27.80]In story mode, you'll overcome aliens, collect power-ups, and explore Mars and beyond.
[41:34.96]You can also go helmet to helmet with other players in battle mode, a real-time head-to-head race through an alien landscape where you need to control checkpoints and claim the flag to gain ultimate victory.
[41:49.81]Commander Keen will soft launch this summer on iOS and Android phones.
[41:55.18]We all know the worst part about this.
[41:56.44]It's not the fact that everyone's like, oh, bad, bad.
[42:00.56]You guys realize that, like, mobile games like that make more money than, like, God of War did, probably?
[42:15.15]That game is gonna make more money than the global fucking theater run of Avatar.
[42:21.72]That's just the way it is.
[42:22.46]That's just the way it is now.
[42:27.82]Thank you, Kira.
[42:30.53]At Bethesda, we, like you, love mobile games.
[42:34.19]In addition to Blades and the upcoming Commander Keen, millions of you have enjoyed Fallout Shelter, which has now reached over 150 million downloads and counting.
[42:43.67]I told you.
[42:44.09]How many people saw Avatar?
[42:47.51]How many people saw the movie Avatar?
[42:49.20]For fans of collectible card games, we brought The Elder Scrolls Legends to mobile so you could experience The Elder Scrolls in a new way.
[42:56.20]this year the legends community has continued to grow upgrades new features and new content it's a great experience for a night of gaming or a quick match over a cup of coffee I gotta get out of here oh no it's taking over it's over guys it's it's it's mobile is the new it's taken over
[43:46.66]Somebody said, no, what if we, like... It's not gonna work.
[43:50.65]You can be upset about this, but you understand something.
[43:54.01]You're just one person and a hundred grandmas are gonna fucking download this.
[43:59.70]You think he could win against a hundred grandmas?
[44:01.24]I don't think he could.
[44:04.26]Make your plan.
[44:31.27]They want like everybody to be playing this in homework But I told you that's gonna be a fucking homework reminder Got reported?
[45:11.58]It's the future, guys.
[45:12.26]It's the future.
[45:12.66]Mobile's not?
[45:13.14]There's two different mobiles now?
[45:15.74]It's mobile and tablet.
[45:16.54]Aren't they both mobile?
[45:42.44]Now, speaking of new content, three weeks ago we released Rage 2.
[45:48.31]And now Insanity rules for millions of players around the world.
[45:56.86]But we wanted to do more than just deliver a critically acclaimed open world shooter.
[46:01.84]We've already added community challenges that reward you just for having fun in the wasteland.
[46:06.20]And we've got a lot more planned with new features rolling out this week.
[46:10.53]The world of Rage 2 will become even more unpredictable.
[46:13.31]I wish I was watching porn.
[46:15.03]What did that say?
[46:43.00]puke explosions.
[46:45.56]Don't say shit.
[47:11.10]No, I'm not gonna play Andrew WK.
[47:12.32]I got yelled at last year for doing that too many times.
[47:15.08]Now I miss the taste of flesh.
[47:28.29]That's my next tattoo!
[47:36.86]Eeny, meeny, miny, mech.
[47:53.66]I got a tremendous surprise for you all.
[47:56.94]I'm flying!
[48:11.70]You're the witch, let it roll.
[48:18.59]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[48:19.75]That's not glued.
[48:21.31]That's fucking glued.
[48:22.33]I'm not doing that.
[48:23.04]Please welcome executive producer at Machine Games, Jerk Gustafsson.
[48:35.72]Hello, everyone.
[48:38.40]After liberating America from the Nazi scum, in Wolfenstein II, the new Colossus... Wolfenstein III!
[48:50.25]This year, we take you back to Europe with two new Wolfenstein games.
[48:56.89]First, we are bringing Nazi killing into virtual reality with Wolfenstein VR.
[49:03.12]Alright.
[49:05.84]With Wolfenstein Cyberpilot.
[49:09.32]As a hacker working for the French resistance, you will take control of Nazi war machines and turn them against their creators.
[49:19.73]Cyberpilot will be available this July, and it's playable this week in our E3 booth.
[49:35.13]And if you haven't fought Nazis in VR, you don't know what you are missing.
[49:41.41]But, as I said, we have two new Wolfenstein games.
[49:47.51]This summer we are going to be launching Wolfenstein Youngblood.
[49:52.39]Wolfenstein Youngblood.
[49:56.50]Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein, and then Wolfenstein, another Wolfenstein.
[49:59.98]With a gameplay experience that is bigger than any previous Wolfenstein game.
[50:05.00]There's now Wolfenstein 3.
[50:05.96]You will have more weapons and weapon upgrades than ever before.
[50:10.60]More ways to customize your playstyle.
[50:13.72]And, of course, even more evil Nazis to kill.
[50:17.68]What is it for?
[50:24.50]And in Youngblood, you can kill those Nazis with a friend.
[50:30.54]You couldn't do that in Wolfenstein 2?
[50:31.84]Was it only in Singapore?
[50:34.75]Yes, Wolfenstein is going co-op.
[50:39.01]Youngblood is set in the 1980s, two decades after the new Colossus.
[50:45.57]BJ Blazkowicz is missing in Nazi-occupied Paris, and it's up to his twin daughters, Jess and Soph, to track him down.
[50:57.69]In Youngblood, you can still play by yourself, or you can partner with a pal to double up on shooting, stabbing and killing Nazis.
[51:10.88]Check it out.
[51:17.38]Paris, Nazi country.
[51:21.15]That's where Papa is, so that's where we're going.
[51:25.03]We can find him together.
[51:27.11]I may have an assignment suitable for two Nazi killers such as yourselves.
[51:32.90]Do we get to kill Nazis in this one?
[51:34.68]Somebody said, ah, I think probably.
[51:37.20]I think so.
[51:55.91]I'll steward her, sis.
[52:48.74]Wolfenstein Youngblood releases on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on July 26th.
[53:10.41]Alright.
[53:11.01]I mean, that comes out, like, now in, like, less than a month and a half.
[53:17.31]And if you can't wait, stop by our E3 booth to play this week.
[53:21.73]Thank you.
[53:22.19]And now, I'd like to welcome to the stage my dear friends from Arcane Leon, who worked with us on these two Wolfenstein games, Dinga and Sebastian.
[53:50.40]Did I mute myself?
[53:51.62]No.
[53:52.94]I didn't mute myself.
[53:56.11]We love you too.
[54:03.49]Hi, I'm Dinga Bakaba, I'm game director at Arkane Lyon.
[54:08.07]Is this for Wolfenstein or is it a new game?
[54:12.98]So, along with partnering with our good friends at Machine Games on Wolfenstein,
[54:17.43]We've been working on other projects at Arcane Lyon.
[54:21.37]And tonight, we're excited to announce our latest first-person action game.
[54:27.93]It's something innovative, stylish, and different from anything we've done before.
[54:33.17]Innovative, stylish, and different.
[54:34.25]Let me begin by saying bienvenue to the frozen island of Blackreef.
[54:41.01]This is a place of mystery where looks can kill.
[54:47.85]The game takes place during what we say in French is a period of folie, a time of madness.
[54:55.96]And now that we've given you a small taste of the world, let us introduce you to our two deadly rivals, Colt and Juliana.
[55:04.45]Is it just concept art?
[55:05.87]It's not, is it just, no, okay.
[55:21.51]This place isn't a Paradise.
[55:24.66]It's a prison.
[55:30.99]Out here, we're trapped in this endless, eternal cycle.
[55:52.38]My life's purpose is on this island.
[55:57.05]And I can't let this go on any longer.
[56:03.41]The more days I repeat... The longer that I'm out here... The more certain I am... What do I have to do?
[56:11.52]The only way to protect the cycle... The only way to break the cycle... Is to kill you.
[56:31.86]It's gonna be like a 1v1 action-adventure game?
[56:36.24]Multiplayer?
[56:50.20]Deathloop.
[56:50.84]Alright, let's get some deets on this one.
[56:54.94]Let's get the details.
[56:56.34]I want details on this one.
[57:09.09]I mean, yeah.
[57:40.51]What is it?
[57:40.81]Are we allowed to swear in person but not like on the trailer?
[57:44.77]They're really emphasizing like the F word here.
[57:46.55]They're like, oh, fuck!
[57:48.11]But their trailer has like... I don't understand.
[58:07.05]It's a wonderful way to get away from all the pressures in life.
[58:12.18]I think the sense of community has really helped me as a person because I'm typically very isolated.
[58:17.56]It's definitely very confidence building.
[58:19.83]It's brought me out of my shell and stopped being an introvert.
[58:22.59]I could be a hero and do all these things.
[58:24.97]You find really creative, really fun, really talented people.
[58:29.16]Meet people who are in my group that I've only known as a character.
[58:32.24]Probably made more friends online than I have in real life.
[58:35.92]The games that you bring out just helps people honestly.
[58:40.06]My parents were refugees from the Vietnam War, which is why I'm also fascinated by elements of war.
[58:45.97]Playing these games just kind of put me out of
[58:49.23]the worry and the stress.
[58:51.91]I was in a dark place for a while, and I told myself I wasn't going to be there anymore.
[58:57.94]And so now the only dark places that I'm allowed to go are in dungeons and ESO.
[59:01.88]Just being someone who is LGBT, it's nice to be able to sit down and play these games and feel accepted for who I am.
[59:10.40]It's really nice to see that their storyline has some sort of emotional effect on me as a player.
[59:15.14]And I just really admire the creativity that goes into the process of making these big worlds with these amazing stories.
[59:23.02]Good shit.
[59:25.05]This is old, man.
[59:25.83]This is like old milk.
[59:27.15]I didn't even drink it.
[59:32.91]Building these fantastic worlds and telling these stories comes from a passion to deliver the very best experiences for our players.
[59:41.49]Hi, I'm James Altman, Director of Publishing at Bethesda.
[59:48.32]What do you got for us?
[59:52.72]Starlight, whatever it's called, Starfleet, what's the name of that game?
[59:58.17]Stargrazer, what's the one everyone wants to see?
[60:02.62]Starfield.
[60:03.04]We have some exciting new technology to show you that can dramatically improve gaming from millions.
[60:09.48]So for the past two decades, we've approached game development not by looking at what is possible today, but with a vision of what can be possible tomorrow.
[60:18.48]And at Bethesda, we're proud of our legacy of innovation, where again and again we've changed the industry.
[60:24.69]We were the first to use physics-based engines for sports games.
[60:28.82]We were groundbreakers with go anywhere, do anything, open world RPGs.
[60:33.74]We are the inventors of the first person shooter, which is now the world's most popular form of gaming.
[60:43.39]We are pioneers in downloadable content and the first to bring mods to consoles.
[60:48.27]And actually, since we first brought mods to consoles in 2016, there have been one billion mod downloads for Fallout and Skyrim.
[61:02.71]We, of course, developed the first commercially viable VR technology revealed in our E3 booth in 2012.
[61:08.95]Yes, that is the original VR headset held together by tape and worn by our very own Tim Willits.
[61:15.25]They're taking a lot of credit.
[61:18.60]We also invented corn, maize.
[61:21.62]And, of course, we are well-known as developers of best-in-class... I invented the hamburger, too.
[61:31.45]And weirdly enough, we also invented the dentist drill!
[61:35.06]Streaming?
[61:35.26]Streamers?
[61:58.80]I heard stream streamer.
[61:59.88]I'm a streamer.
[62:00.36]I'm not gonna like this.
[62:02.08]Maybe I'll like this Orion is a tremendous breakthrough in streaming technology It is our name for a group of patented technologies that optimize game engines for performance in a cloud environment Orion can work with any game engine and will improve player experiences No matter which game you're playing or whether you're streaming on stadia on x cloud or another streaming platform So how does Orion work?
[62:28.47]The exciting game streaming services you've been hearing so much about have largely focused on hardware solutions to address the complex challenges of streaming.
[62:36.17]That was a lot of words.
[62:39.88]We used our expertise in developing game engine software and took a different approach.
[62:45.04]By incorporating Orion technology at the game engine level, we were able to stream game content up to 20% faster per frame, leading to a dramatic reduction in latency.
[62:57.67]In addition, an Orion-enabled game can stream with up to 40% lower bandwidth.
[63:03.11]And happily, for game developers, Orion technology is easy to integrate with your game build with RSDK.
[63:09.30]what does that mean for you it means that streaming games will be faster and better with orion and orion substantially reduces the cost of streaming for players and for publishers so it won't matter if your friends and family are sucking up all the bandwidth or if you live far away from a data center with orion you'll still be able to stream your game at max settings
[63:37.75]But that's real.
[63:38.71]I mean, max settings.
[63:43.20]It's a big deal if it works.
[63:46.76]Now, as with any new computer technology, one must ask the question, can it play Doom?
[63:55.71]He said the word question.
[63:57.97]Can it stream and unrelenting streaming in my head right now?
[64:00.99]First person shooter with native 4K resolution at 60 frames per second.
[64:06.56]Let's see.
[64:07.02]Oh, I finally do.
[64:08.34]I want to see this.
[64:09.02]So I wish I could see Dylan right now.
[64:11.10]I'd like to introduce.
[64:15.40]I can't wait.
[64:16.02]Oh, here it comes, guys.
[64:17.28]This is it.
[64:17.88]It's coming right now.
[64:19.12]Holy shit, he's actually doing it.
[64:33.20]This is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[64:35.51]I can't fucking move.
[64:36.95]I can't move.
[64:37.49]Holy shit!
[64:39.25]Are you kidding me?
[64:39.79]This is fucking the greatest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
[64:41.47]What the fuck, dude?
[65:03.06]Whoa!
[65:34.50]What you interfere with now is bigger than you can imagine.
[65:41.95]If you continue, you will bring down the heavens wrath.
[65:50.73]It is written.
[65:55.19]It is their time to give penance.
[66:14.12]They are no longer your people to save.
[66:51.57]Holy shit.
[66:58.39]I'm gonna need some help.
[67:19.60]Thank you so so much I'm Marty Stratton the executive producer of doom eternal and I'm And I'm Hugo Martin the game's creative director I
[67:37.65]As you just saw, we're not just building a world for Doom.
[67:41.51]It's in the entire universe.
[67:43.53]Earth is on the brink of annihilation.
[67:46.38]It's being consumed by demons.
[67:48.70]And your crusade to save it will take you across dimensions to locations never seen before in Doom, from heaven and hell to the Sentinel homeworld and beyond.
[68:00.43]Yeah.
[68:03.71]This is probably going to be good.
[68:06.73]There is so much to see and discover, but Doom is first and foremost about gameplay, and Doom Eternal promises to be the ultimate power fantasy.
[68:18.20]The fun comes from mastering the experience because you are the Doom Slayer, the strongest, fastest demon killer in existence, and nothing can stand in your way.
[68:31.21]Absolutely.
[68:34.95]Of course, the challenge in Doom is all about handcrafted combat, but also engaging level design.
[68:43.12]And in Doom Eternal, the game always has something new to throw at you even deep into the campaign.
[68:50.42]Let's take a look.
[68:52.59]This is going to be good.
[68:55.37]Doom's combat was a ton of fun.
[69:14.27]The chat's way behind.
[69:15.18]There's like a two minute delay on the stream.
[69:17.51]For stream snipers.
[69:43.46]What the fuck was that?
[69:47.07]Was it a brain?
[69:48.53]Thanks.
[70:00.71]You know, it's so important to us at id Software that every aspect of the gameplay has real meaning to you, the player.
[70:09.05]Every enemy is different, every weapon has a purpose, and every decision you make really counts.
[70:15.02]The only path to victory in Doom Eternal is to aggressively control the fight with amazing agility, powerful guns, and critical resources.
[70:25.19]That's right, I'll tell you, we absolutely can't wait for you to play it.
[70:29.99]and some of you won't have to wait too long.
[70:33.23]If you are lucky enough to be in the room tonight... In the room tonight?
[70:39.25]Not like open at E3?
[70:40.75]You'll have a chance to play it immediately following the show.
[70:47.17]What the hell?
[70:48.05]Why am I not there?
[70:49.11]I want to be there.
[70:54.04]Look under your seat.
[70:54.68]I got one.
[70:54.96]So what are we looking for here?
[70:55.96]Guys, guys, hey.
[70:56.90]What are we looking for?
[71:26.82]Is Doom Returnal the only game that has shown this much gameplay?
[71:40.72]I feel like we haven't seen very much gameplay this whole conference.
[71:52.75]Or is this gameplay or is this not?
[71:59.92]There we go.
[72:02.30]I mean, it's going to be scripted gameplay, but we'll see.
[72:13.13]It looks great.
[72:19.87]Missed chest.
[72:21.85]Missed chest.
[72:24.17]Guys, I'm not playing the game right now.
[72:27.27]I'm not doing this.
[72:41.45]The streamer sucks.
[72:49.51]You guys are vicious.
[73:23.93]Looks fun.
[73:25.15]It does.
[73:47.55]Turn up your FOV?
[73:48.29]No, I don't play with higher FOV.
[73:50.77]Gives me an advantage over other players.
[74:23.13]Yeah, this is a lot of gameplay.
[74:24.45]It's pretty foreign in the world of E3.
[74:56.10]Louder, louder, louder.
[74:57.72]Get that lava.
[75:06.41]Don't just wanna put that lava on your ice cream.
[75:15.69]Like, let it cool down for a little bit and then drip it on your ice cream.
[75:21.05]I feel like lava is a spicy orange flavor.
[75:23.60]Like a spicy, um, like clementine-like flavor.
[75:44.52]Thanks.
[75:46.88]Thanks.
[75:48.40]Thanks, guys.
[75:49.90]That was awesome.
[75:51.12]Did the scream guy get up?
[75:54.02]Maybe he got up and started screaming.
[75:55.50]Because the gameplay that you just saw is just a piece of what you're going to play this week at E3.
[76:01.63]Yeah.
[76:06.55]But I bet a lot of you are wondering when do we get to play Doom Eternal at our home?
[76:11.61]Well...
[76:12.91]You don't have to wait too much longer.
[76:15.71]Not quite tomorrow.
[76:19.39]September.
[76:19.87]But Doom Eternal will release on November 22nd.
[76:23.15]I was close.
[76:30.06]It's already been out for two months.
[76:33.32]How did you miss it in the Steam store?
[76:35.86]An amazing collector's edition we're really proud of.
[76:39.41]Yeah.
[76:41.17]Yeah.
[76:42.11]That's an actual helmet.
[76:46.27]Yeah, you could wear that thing.
[76:52.41]He's already got one on.
[76:58.02]Lucky.
[76:58.26]This guy's already got it.
[77:00.42]That's right.
[77:01.20]Already a badass.
[77:02.16]He's already got one on.
[77:05.07]Alright, well, we've got one more thing we know that you've been waiting to hear about.
[77:09.10]He just chimes in and he's like, Actually, no.
[77:11.34]I'm a fucking astronaut, dickhead.
[77:15.00]I just got off the moon.
[77:16.84]We've been developing this in-house at id, and it's unlike anything you've played before.
[77:22.18]Yeah, we've been so pumped, Ed, to share this with you.
[77:26.07]This is pure Doom, but with your friends, where two player-controlled demons take on one fully-loaded Slayer in a fight to the death.
[77:35.50]2v1?
[77:36.02]This is a first-person fighter.
[77:38.58]where it's demon strategy versus Slayer skill.
[77:42.08]You know, we can't wait because we know you'll love the different play styles of the various demons because each has unique movement, attacks, and abilities.
[77:52.91]They can even spawn AI Germans to control the battlefield and help you take down the Slayer.
[77:58.93]It's strategic, competitive, and it's a ton of fun.
[78:02.67]And we can't wait to share more details with you this year at QuakeCon.
[78:07.13]That's right, a lot more to share at QuakeCon.
[78:09.81]But before we go, we do want to take a first look at Doom Eternal's new multiplayer.
[78:15.94]Oh, we are going to get to see it.
[78:16.64]On behalf of our amazing team at it in Dallas and Frankfurt, Germany, we want to thank you all so much for your support.
[78:24.44]Thanks, everyone.
[78:33.08]two V one demons versus one decked out player fight
[78:58.65]Yes, Dermot!
[78:59.62]2v1!
[78:59.82]Yes!
[79:00.24]Oh, is this... Is this 2v1?
[79:02.56]2v1, I guess.
[79:33.42]Yeah, I mean, it's... It looks alright.
[79:43.64]It's kind of just... It'll be fun probably for a while.
[79:55.33]And now introducing Goldust.
[80:03.41]And for everyone at our studios around the globe that have worked so hard on the great games you've seen tonight, we say thank you.
[80:10.72]2019 marks 25 years of Doom.
[80:13.28]So to celebrate, we will be going all out with Doom at QuakeCon this summer.
[80:17.38]No Elder Scrolls VI and no Starfield.
[80:18.58]Branding a whole host of panels and activities dedicated to Doom, which we call DoomCon.
[80:25.69]DoomCon.
[80:25.89]See what we did there?
[80:26.69]We took out the Quake and put Doom.
[80:30.31]We hope you can come hang out with us in Dallas at our inaugural event in London.
[80:33.77]If you can't, please tune in online.
[80:35.81]Until then, go to Bethesda.net for more info on all the games you saw tonight.
[80:40.63]If you're here at E3 this week, we'll have hands-on with many of our games, so be sure to stop by our booth.
[80:45.94]In the meantime, thanks for playing, thanks for watching, and thanks to all of you for being part of the Bethesda meeting.
[80:51.34]They'll do like an Elder Scrolls VI teaser, right?
[80:54.80]They did one last year.
[80:55.88]Of course they are.
[80:57.26]They did one last year.
[81:02.53]They teased it last year and it's not ready to show at all.
[81:06.86]But the true hero is you.
[81:13.85]They already confirmed no.
[81:15.29]It's like we hand you this malleable clay and you do these extraordinary things that we never could have imagined.
[81:22.10]We get to build these worlds and these communities and you all come in and you play and you bring these worlds that we create to life.
[81:29.09]We need more PR.
[81:29.79]You help us build richer worlds.
[81:32.07]More PR?
[81:33.65]We need PR.
[81:34.47]You had meaning to everything we do.
[81:38.47]We are glad you're here.
[81:39.41]We're so glad you're here.
[81:40.75]To the heroes.
[81:42.38]To the heroes.
[81:43.98]Shit, I don't have a drink.
[81:45.36]To you.
[81:46.04]To you.
[82:03.11]Well, there it is.
[82:06.34]Bethesda Conference.
[82:07.60]Done.
[82:11.52]Got a lot of mobile games.
[82:13.50]Got a lot of... We got to see a lot of Doom Eternal, though.
[82:17.38]That's one thing.
[82:17.93]You got to see a lot of Doom.
[82:20.27]You got to see it.
[82:22.75]2v1.
[82:23.89]Looks like it's 2v1 in that mode.
[82:25.51]I'm not sure.
[82:26.39]Could be.
[82:29.21]And that's it.
[82:30.98]That's it.
[82:39.21]That was me singing, by the way.
[82:40.47]It was?
[82:41.51]Am I going to pretend to be a streamer?
[82:43.49]Alright.
[82:44.43]Well, that's what Bethesda had to offer there at E3.
[82:49.49]They mentioned Fallout 76.
[82:51.03]Hell, they gave it an expansion.
[82:56.18]Did they close my stream?
[82:57.84]Did they turn me off?
[82:59.16]You guys just saw the Bethesda conference.
[83:01.36]We don't want you doing this shit.
[83:03.12]So prepare thyselves.
[83:06.34]Go walk us through the Fallout 76 stuff.
[83:09.62]If I could play back the bot and just highlight your face the entire time, it would maybe tell the story.
[83:13.92]Highlight my face.
[83:15.12]Let's hear you put it into words.
[83:19.06]I already pretended I was on the panel like three times.
[83:22.63]You want me to do this joke again?
[83:25.53]It was a funny joke.
[83:26.51]That was the punchline, actually.
[83:28.95]And...
[83:33.53]turns out at some point we slipped into the worst timeline I don't know exactly when that happened but we just kind of kind of slipped streamed on in there yeah um it it was it was uh it was pretty impressive as far as I know there's still like some major major bugs with fault 76 and that that whole thing about like which is one of the reasons when when Tom was like yeah we have such a great community it's kind of like that's because your pvp mechanics are broken
[84:01.48]Right.
[84:02.66]That's why they aren't killing each other.
[84:04.25]It's because that system is fundamentally flawed.
[84:06.65]It's fucked up.
[84:07.39]And people don't use it.
[84:09.18]You want to.
[84:10.10]You can't.
[84:11.00]Yeah.
[84:11.80]So it's kind of...
[84:15.37]It's a little interesting.
[84:17.41]I don't know.
[84:18.89]Here's the thing.
[84:19.93]I knew there was going to be Blade stuff.
[84:22.87]I knew there was going to be ESO R26.
[84:25.99]This is the kind of stuff they had to do.
[84:27.86]These are all things that are ongoing projects.
[84:31.58]But I will say the Commander Keen stuff.
[84:36.64]That was... That kind of hit me on a spiritual level.
[84:42.22]I grew up with Commander Keen.
[84:43.86]It was alright.
[84:46.30]And it was the kind of thing where, you know, and I'm just going to go ahead and pretty much make the same joke.
[84:53.49]It's the kind of thing where... I do that every day, so...
[85:00.68]and then die this public, execution-style death where everyone just gave up on it.
[85:06.44]And now we have to do that with Commander Keen, and it's just like... It's unfortunate.
[85:16.37]It's like us old people have to watch our favorite franchises become our worst enemy.
[85:22.98]Mortal Kombat says hello.
[85:25.36]It's just unfortunate.
[85:27.06]Should we just go into the conference talk at this point?
[85:29.83]Yeah.
[85:30.05]Zeke, me and you are out on Fallout 76.
[85:32.05]We played it for a day and then we're good there.
[85:35.93]Nobody played it.
[85:36.49]And you also are...
[85:47.16]Follow me.
[85:47.80]Follow me.
[85:48.58]Follow me.
[85:49.73]I'm sorry.
[85:50.99]I get weird when that happens.
[85:53.13]Is the BR at all interesting?
[85:54.61]No.
[85:55.13]What's your guys' favorite fast food?
[85:58.98]Movement in everything of the Fallout games has never been my draw to it.
[86:02.02]So why would I want a game that relies on movement and shooting?
[86:06.13]when those are the things that are not good about the game.
[86:09.40]Well said.
[86:10.22]That's Fallout 76.
[86:12.60]Wendy's is probably the best, I think.
[86:13.82]They're also still having, like, pretty major server stability issues.
[86:17.10]Yeah.
[86:17.50]Yeah, no, they really are.
[86:18.37]They are, you're right.
[86:18.85]Small groups of players on spread out servers, and they're wanting to do, like, 52 players.
[86:26.65]Fucking hilarious.
[86:27.57]Somebody in my chat just said, hold on, hold on, listen.
[86:31.03]Somebody in my chat just said that Burger King was the best.
[86:34.99]I'm sorry.
[86:35.78]I'm sorry.
[86:36.06]I don't mean to interrupt you.
[86:37.22]Burger King, really?
[86:37.84]That's unbelievable.
[86:38.56]I can't even.
[86:49.63]I'm sorry.
[86:50.17]I'm sorry.
[86:50.71]I really don't mean to fuck this whole thing up.
[86:53.07]My favorite thing, I think, about the Fallout 76 portion is the crowd member that when they said that the server capacity was being raised just lost his shit.
[87:00.83]He just really was all about the server capacity.
[87:04.35]What was going on with the fucking crowd the whole conference?
[87:07.11]The guy's screaming!
[87:08.21]The guy's fucking screaming!
[87:10.93]Right?
[87:15.94]You get it.
[87:16.76]There was employees up front.
[87:17.96]Do we have a direct source that was saying it?
[87:19.90]Well, they were all wearing Bethesda shirts, so I think that was the...
[87:24.03]I went to a CS conference like two years ago and they had like room for seats in the very front.
[87:29.00]So I'm assuming based off of that that was like what they did before.
[87:32.90]Right.
[87:33.12]But I'm not positive.
[87:35.24]I gotta go.
[87:37.14]Thanks for inviting me.
[87:38.60]I appreciate it.
[87:39.08]I gotta get out of here.
[87:39.82]They weren't kidding when they said that 76 has an active player base.
[87:42.20]Like I know people that are still, they put all the stuff to the side and they're still enjoying those games.
[87:47.73]And ESO is bigger than it's ever been.
[87:49.93]So, I mean, there's, you know, there's, if you can drink the Kool-Aid, if you like that kind of stuff, then, you know.
[87:56.51]Kool-Aid's not.
[87:57.01]They're there.
[87:57.41]They're around.
[87:58.31]Yeah.
[87:59.25]I got to, I'm sorry, guys.
[88:00.89]I got to go.
[88:01.29]I have to get out of here.
[88:02.15]I highly doubt it.
[88:02.94]I'm supposed to be here for like two hours, but.
[88:06.72]I got to go to Burger King because people think it's a joke that I like it.
[88:09.90]How much do you love Fallout 76?
[88:10.86]Or, excuse me, how much do you love Bethesda?
[88:14.24]And they gave out T-shirts and said, we'll give you a front row ticket.
[88:17.72]should I just go make sure to be really enthusiastic sure yeah I thought my name is Jerma I would think they would know like maybe tone it down after a little bit
[88:28.42]Well, we got to be careful.
[88:29.36]It's not yuck, they're yum.
[88:31.20]You know?
[88:33.08]Yeah, celebrate.
[88:34.76]If I can get a shout out.
[88:35.70]We'll have our negative opinions and they can keep coming back.
[88:38.70]Exactly, exactly.
[88:40.46]The other favorite thing, I think Zeke caught this.
[88:42.90]I don't know if Anne or Co did, but Zeke lost a shit when they said it.
[88:45.86]In the Wastelanders trailer that they showed, the voice acted line was, we didn't expect anyone to come back.
[88:52.87]That was...
[88:56.37]That's pretty on the nose.
[88:58.47]Just get somebody else.
[88:59.33]That was so, so delicious to hear that.
[89:02.32]Just like, we didn't expect anyone to come back.
[89:05.00]I was like, really?
[89:06.95]Really?
[89:08.73]Yeah.
[89:09.59]The other stuff... The next line was, I can't believe you idiots are still giving us your money.
[89:15.81]Yeah, but we were all laughing, so no one heard.
[89:17.46]Exactly, that's right.
[89:19.60]Kel, the other stuff, and you brought this up when we were watching it, the human NPCs, full quest line, and dialog trees, didn't they say that stuff was never going to be in Fallout 76?
[89:28.02]They specifically marketed the product to not include that.
[89:32.33]It's just kind of hilarious, because when the beta came out, like...
[89:35.85]Everyone and their mother was like this game could totally have NPCs like you should put NPCs in here and they were like no No, no, that's our decision.
[89:43.31]We are you're deciding not to do this and this is gonna be awesome And then a year later, they're like, okay guys, we're putting the NPCs in Okay, and they're gonna have quest lines and dialog trees like we're putting them back in like it's cool.
[89:54.64]It's cool Yeah, and it's just kind of funny cuz it's like dude that's what they were screaming at you from before the game was out and
[90:03.31]Now, maybe if they start listening to all that stuff, like, hey, maybe Fallout 76 can get good.
[90:07.21]Like, maybe it's a step in the right direction.
[90:09.39]Like, you know, nothing's not savable given enough work and time.
[90:13.42]So, yeah, we'll see.
[90:14.72]We'll see.
[90:15.82]We will indeed see.
[90:17.58]Right after that, I think the show's starting to get some life into it, I would say, with Ghostwire Tokyo, which is from the Evil Within devs.
[90:27.57]This thing looks pretty good.
[90:29.97]It's an action-adventure game.
[90:32.35]Whoa!
[90:33.45]Yeah, like we didn't see any gameplay at all, but the trailer was sick.
[90:37.96]Like that was a really good trailer or teaser or whatever the fuck you want to call it, but.
[90:43.23]No, we'll see the gameplay, but... Yeah.
[90:46.63]No!
[90:47.63]Think about Evil Within.
[90:48.87]These are the same devs.
[90:49.91]They did a great job of translating their CGI stuff, which they initially just showed, into an actual pretty well-made game.
[90:59.42]Like, I had a great time with Evil Within.
[91:01.60]And not only that, but it was like... And yeah, I've known other people as well.
[91:05.32]I like you within one inch.
[91:06.56]I didn't.
[91:06.92]I really didn't.
[91:08.94]But with this new thing, apparently something I didn't pick up on is the guy that introduced the woman who then introduced it, she is like his protege.
[91:17.79]Yeah.
[91:18.49]So it's kind of like we just kind of witnessed this path
[91:21.52]This passing of the torch, which is kind of awesome.
[91:24.78]And she was great, by the way.
[91:26.48]Oh, my gosh.
[91:26.96]She was adorable.
[91:27.74]Yeah, she was great.
[91:28.78]She was awesome.
[91:29.90]I think... Yeah, man.
[91:31.18]I think this is a sequel.
[91:32.50]The aesthetic was awesome.
[91:33.90]A lot of stylized elements.
[91:35.35]A lot of really interesting imagery.
[91:38.19]If the gameplay is good, this could be... This could be big.
[91:41.33]Yeah.
[91:41.69]I thought about it.
[91:42.69]Zeke, thoughts?
[91:43.95]Yeah.
[91:44.49]Well, I... Like, just a scene like that.
[91:47.73]Like, look at that.
[91:48.35]There's...
[91:49.32]I thought those were going to turn into worms, by the way.
[91:51.54]Sorry, interrupt.
[91:54.34]What is that?
[91:56.92]Worms.
[91:57.66]Yeah.
[92:00.64]Yeah.
[92:01.14]Hey, no, hey, no.
[92:02.49]What are you doing?
[92:03.53]No, I want to be part of it, too.
[92:06.31]The look of it and the intrigue, the, like, you know, not knowing what's going on, but how cool it, like, it's compelling.
[92:14.82]And I really am intrigued to see how this...
[92:20.10]They fucking cut me off.
[92:21.72]No, I want to do it.
[92:23.72]I want to do it too.
[92:24.66]Alright.
[92:40.96]That was fun.
[92:49.17]I'm not doing Devolver.
[92:51.59]See my hair?
[92:53.67]No, I gotta get food.
[92:55.36]I'm hungry.
[92:56.92]Devolver's like an hour and a half.
[93:06.00]By the way, let me just say, all those people there, they're really fun, nice people.
[93:13.41]Just don't ban me from Twitch.
[93:18.11]I didn't do anything.
[93:20.97]Devolver is happening right now.
[93:24.15]What do you mean?
[93:24.91]You can hear me.
[93:25.33]You can hear me right now.
[93:29.09]No, no, no, no, no.
[93:30.01]No Devolver.
[93:30.95]I want to watch Devolver like downstairs with like a bowl of spaghetti.
[93:39.24]I just want to eat a bowl of spaghetti downstairs and watch Devolver.
[93:41.24]Devolver is only like an hour, like 45 minutes, right?
[93:43.72]Less than 45 minutes?
[93:46.26]I'm way too loud now.
[93:47.30]No, I'm fine.
[93:51.82]I'm not going to eat a bowl of... No, I'm not going to... I'll see you tomorrow.
[93:54.06]I'll see you tomorrow for, uh... What's the first... What's tomorrow?
[93:59.68]Let's take a look.
[94:10.50]Tomorrow is... Ubisoft Square.
[94:17.57]We'll catch those months.
[94:23.82]Go make duck broth.
[94:26.46]We're going to play Cooking Sim tomorrow because I have to kill like an hour or two again in the middle.
[94:33.60]When is the PC gaming show as well?
[94:35.86]That's at like 10 o'clock in the morning, isn't it?
[94:42.47]Okay, is that 10 a.m.
[94:43.47]Eastern?
[94:53.88]10, 9, 8, do I gotta get up at 7 o'clock in the morning?
[95:02.00]Please don't leave me!
[95:07.64]You might see me for the PC if you want to.
[95:19.19]Don't go, don't go.
[95:20.57]Skip it.
[95:22.29]Yeah, we'll see.
[95:24.70]I gotta get some food in me.
[95:29.10]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[95:34.84]That's the end.
[95:39.91]It's been six and a half hours.
[95:41.11]Holy shit.
[95:51.73]Watch Devolver.
[95:52.43]I'll be cross.
[95:56.51]this before everyone hates me yeah I'll be live for uh for at least Ubisoft and square we'll play something in the middle if I get up early enough maybe the pc conference but I don't think I'm gonna get up at like seven o'clock in the morning what's wrong with my mic is my mic up
[96:25.38]But, interesting stuff.
[96:27.70]I'm really looking forward to Phantasy Star Online 2.
[96:29.56]That looks pretty great.
[96:33.74]It's because I'm peaking.
[96:36.00]Something's not right.
[96:40.69]Devolver doesn't need content.
[96:41.79]That's what I mean.
[96:42.51]Devolver is like its own complete edited video package and me just kind of in the corner.
[96:47.59]I don't think I don't really want to do that.
[96:51.11]For the other ones, it's like live and people are talking.
[96:53.39]Devolver usually does like a full just edited video, right?
[96:56.95]I don't know if I want to just sit there and... I can't really add anything to that, I don't think.
[97:07.83]I felt the same way about Nintendo, too.
[97:10.38]We'll see.
[97:11.64]But we're going to do the bits real quick.
[97:13.92]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[97:14.78]I hope you had a fun time.
[97:15.94]I hope you got to see some things you liked.
[97:18.52]I'll see you tomorrow.
[97:21.00]For more of the conferences.
[97:26.60]If you catch it, you catch it.
[97:27.63]If not, then... Maybe we'll see you again soon.
[97:31.27]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[97:34.31]See you tomorrow.
[97:38.25]And for those of you that are sticking around.
[97:39.91]For a few minutes, while we go over the bits and the subs.
[97:43.71]We had... 250 from Deja...
[97:50.00]Thank you, Deja, for the $2.50.
[97:51.88]Lego Forza sounds like a PS2 cheat code and not a $10 expansion.
[97:55.91]Yeah.
[98:00.55]Yeah.
[98:04.05]People are probably gonna love it, though.
[98:07.51]Tingy, thanks for the $2.50.
[98:09.37]Lego for next Jerm or Rumble.
[98:16.46]Like, just a physical Lego?
[98:23.71]I don't think I can even make that.
[98:27.87]Uh, thank you TurboPasta for the three dollars.
[98:30.37]Master of Comedy has competition.
[98:32.75]Thanks for the laughs.
[98:34.49]And they link a Twitter.
[98:35.39]Somebody made a Jerm of the giant Twitter.
[98:40.35]You guys are fast.
[98:47.09]That's not an officially endorsed Twitter account, by the way.
[98:55.08]Thank you, though.
[98:57.56]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber, for the three dollars.
[98:59.48]It didn't mean much to you, but the LEGO Speed Champions left me hyped.
[99:03.08]The map had an Easter egg to this failed LEGO theme.
[99:07.76]Plus, the LEGO Star Wars announcement left me sobbing with joy.
[99:11.36]Anyways, for the everything is LEGO joke, I have to agree, as we got LEGO Stranger Things and LEGO Minions announced within a month of each other.
[99:20.02]It just does really well.
[99:23.70]Lego is just completely timeless forever.
[99:31.83]A timeless, timeless classic thing that will never go away.
[99:39.75]It's as old as dirt.
[99:42.63]But thank you.
[99:44.71]Thank you.
[99:45.17]Also, two mini clips for the 10 bucks.
[99:48.50]I heard Todd Howard adopted two kids and named one Todd and the other Howard.
[99:55.48]I'm not sure that's real, but thank you for the $10.
[99:57.46]Appreciate it.
[100:01.68]Hey, Zelasky, thanks for the $2.50.
[100:03.22]IS E3 2019, where we celebrate 24 years of gamers pretending at a trade show for investors and retailers, a convention for them, and flipping out when it doesn't live up to their expectations.
[100:20.07]Gotta increase those stock prices.
[100:25.41]Thank you AlStoreH2O for the $5.
[100:27.47]The Microsoft conference felt like they were a bigger pitch to PC gaming.
[100:31.51]Like they're keeping their options open for an exit from the console market.
[100:38.33]Do you think that the big hardware makers focusing on high specs in exchange for price accessibility is the better option for the next generation of gaming?
[100:46.11]All-in-one entertainment consoles like the Xbox One seem to have failed.
[100:51.21]But I worry that going in other directions might make any console that's not the Switch inaccessible.
[100:57.55]Um... I think a lot of the hardware makers are almost really, really desperate to have CD-less and subscription-based content.
[101:13.33]That's starting to really... They can cut back on so many costs.
[101:18.39]They don't have to make...
[101:21.46]product anymore like actual on-the-shelf product anymore if that ever gets to a point think about how much Xbox desperately would save and all these other publishers will save if there's no more physical boxes anymore and that's not really a good thing because we've seen so many times
[101:44.90]Oh yeah, it's just a stream.
[101:46.30]It's a service.
[101:47.04]It's, you know, download the game.
[101:48.66]You don't own it.
[101:49.26]We do, but it's our server, but you get the little key to it.
[101:51.76]That could be bad.
[101:56.60]But that's the direction a lot of them want to go, I think.
[101:59.56]Because they can save so much money on manufacturing costs.
[102:08.25]Somebody mentioned the death of music and CDs.
[102:11.15]Look at Spotify.
[102:11.85]Spotify is what you do for music.
[102:16.96]90% of the people in this chat right now probably just have Spotify.
[102:21.18]And maybe you still have CDs, but... Subscription models are what... It's kind of the future, I guess.
[102:32.07]Interesting to see what happens.
[102:35.81]There are pros and cons for both of them.
[102:39.96]But thank you.
[102:41.26]Uh, but... That's the game where you... You have to argue your way...
[103:10.22]over somebody else with like a monster or a power or something, right?
[103:17.19]They probably updated it a lot.
[103:18.23]Might be worth doing.
[103:20.89]But thank you.
[103:21.33]Thank you, FlyingPixels!
[103:23.15]$30 earlier.
[103:23.55]$30 from FlyingPixels.
[103:25.35]You made me laugh so hard that I cried.
[103:27.35]That hasn't happened in a while.
[103:28.79]Thanks for the laughs.
[103:30.37]Thanks for the $30.
[103:32.51]And for hanging out and choosing my stream to take E3 in with.
[103:38.70]So, thank you.
[103:41.06]Really appreciate it.
[103:44.42]Uh, FreudianWeapon, thanks for 250.
[103:46.48]No message, just 250.
[103:48.62]Thank you.
[103:49.12]Jerma lied and didn't draw sticks.
[103:51.86]Thanks for the 250.
[103:52.94]You're a dragon.
[103:54.82]Hmm.
[103:55.64]You said scalies were not people.
[103:58.28]You aren't a person.
[104:01.06]What?
[104:01.56]No, I said a dragon.
[104:03.16]I said a dragon is not a human.
[104:06.68]They're not.
[104:07.00]They're a lizard.
[104:07.72]They're like a lizard.
[104:09.66]A dragon's not a person.
[104:13.37]They're a... They're a dragon.
[104:20.09]Is that incorrect?
[104:24.81]Spliceable Spleen gave five community subs earlier.
[104:27.19]Thanks for the five subs.
[104:28.67]Dropped them about ten minutes ago.
[104:30.15]Thank you.
[104:35.54]Thank you so much for the five community subs.
[104:37.48]And then finally here, we had... Let's get the credits on here while we have a second.
[104:45.37]Join us tomorrow where we do it all again.
[104:47.31]And we check out some of the other conferences.
[104:52.53]Enjoy the rest of tonight's E3.
[104:53.91]There's Devolver going on like in 20-30 minutes.
[104:58.66]And then probably some after show stuff.
[105:00.02]If you, you know, go check it out.
[105:01.32]There's a lot of great streamers doing this.
[105:04.28]There's a lot of good content.
[105:05.14]A lot of good live stuff going on I think after too.
[105:07.10]So check it out.
[105:10.18]Let's roll the credits.
[105:13.65]Right now.
[105:16.14]Here they come.
[105:19.19]Oh my god.
[105:21.13]With this many subs?
[105:25.11]Holy shit.
[105:30.02]That's a lot of fucking people.
[105:31.30]I didn't know that this many people subbed tonight.
[105:33.64]Wow.
[105:35.62]That's a lot.
[105:37.02]Thank you to everybody that continues to subscribe to this stream.
[105:44.31]You had close to 8k viewers, so yeah.
[105:46.07]And that's... Thanks for watching.
[105:48.07]Hopefully you thought it was fun.
[105:53.03]Feed your guild members will do.
[105:54.98]Right before I close it out.
[106:00.70]But thank you to Peaceful Haley for the 250.
[106:02.74]Thank you, Peaceful Haley.
[106:06.02]Hey, Jeremy, how are you?
[106:07.02]I'm doing pretty damn good.
[106:08.89]I haven't been here in a while, but this year's Bethesda conference is probably the worst.
[106:12.31]Just completely dull, but at the same time, I don't like shitting on the people who make these games, because they work hard and are excited about it, and I hate seeing people shit on them.
[106:21.57]Even though I can agree, yeah, this is pretty boring and meh, hope Nintendo will save the day.
[106:26.03]Anyways, enjoy your night.
[106:29.83]Yeah, I mean, it's... Look, there were some great things that were shown today.
[106:36.48]You fell for the bot again.
[106:38.06]What bot?
[106:41.28]What'd I do?
[106:43.52]Jerma has read more bot messages?
[106:49.67]What bot?
[106:54.33]I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
[106:55.57]My chat just crashed.
[106:56.99]What the hell is going on?
[107:00.41]My browser just crashed.
[107:08.04]Oh, anyways.
[107:08.62]Um...
[107:11.22]I mean, there's a lot of things that aren't for me.
[107:13.58]But there's a few things that I would say that looks pretty great.
[107:17.07]The problem with conferences like this... A lot of it is just... Let's all, like, pretend in a room for an hour.
[107:27.77]You know what I mean?
[107:29.83]Hey, let's just, like, get a bunch of people together and let's, like, just... Game some excitement.
[107:35.48]For stuff that may not be as exciting as it looks.
[107:41.19]But that's just the nature of the business.
[107:42.85]That's just the way it is.
[107:45.15]But people have talked shit about like the fake... goofy E3 presentations and game releases and game showings for years, and they're not really changing.
[107:56.60]They kind of still follow the same formula every time.
[107:58.50]Yeah, it's just a giant sales pitch.
[108:02.88]It's a giant pre-sales pitch.
[108:06.97]But obviously, Microsoft announced a new console, which that's not just like a, hey, buy, uh, Washtogs 4.
[108:15.46]I mean, that's a new console.
[108:20.28]But it is what it is.
[108:22.64]I still enjoy them.
[108:23.38]They're still fun to watch.
[108:24.29]They're still interesting because there's like announcements and sometimes they're exciting things like the George R.R.
[108:27.95]Martin and FromSoftware collaboration.
[108:31.53]How could you not be excited about something like that?
[108:33.25]That's a big, that's a huge deal.
[108:35.79]That'll be a lot of fun.
[108:38.51]Hopefully.
[108:42.51]But thank you to PeacefulHaley for that little tidbit.
[108:47.13]FajitaMeat, thanks for the $5.
[108:49.62]Seems good.
[108:50.14]Had a great time watching you watch E3.
[108:52.64]Quick question.
[108:53.68]What's with all the angry faces on your video thumbnails in the Jerma stream archive?
[108:58.54]Wait, what?
[108:59.62]What do you mean angry faces?
[109:10.78]There's only like one ang- there's only one angry- there's no angry face.
[109:15.56]Where?
[109:15.82]I don't see any angry faces.
[109:22.58]I see a little- a couple of awkward weirdo ones.
[109:28.28]I don't see angry face.
[109:32.47]Well, I- I don't- I don't control this channel.
[109:35.99]The logos, like the- the J?
[109:42.04]I don't know but thank you for the five dollars and finally thank you c4g for the 250 final +2 score was 1876. I don't know if the bot posted or not when it was called not bad not bad that's an 1800 plus positive
[110:08.28]But, uh, see you tomorrow.
[110:10.51]Thanks for watching.
[110:12.21]Go enjoy the rest of the last conference that's going on.
[110:18.01]See y'all soon.
[110:19.86]Take care.
[110:20.50]And here's, uh, I'm gonna feed the guild.
[110:23.74]Good night, guys.
