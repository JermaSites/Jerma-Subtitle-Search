[ve:61.1.100]

[00:10.17]Okay, we are... I'm sorry to bring you into this, too.
[00:14.16]No, go ahead.
[00:16.98]Oh, Jerma.
[00:17.64]How's the coin flipping going?
[00:19.77]Dude, I beat it.
[00:20.69]I got all the way to the end, weirdly enough.
[00:24.79]I just finished it.
[00:25.75]I haven't played it.
[00:27.92]You flip a coin, and there is a 20% chance it's going to be heads, not 50.
[00:35.59]And every time you land on heads, it gives you one cent.
[00:38.95]What?
[00:40.68]And then you have to use the money you get for landing on heads to upgrade the coin to be better.
[00:47.83]It's fun.
[00:48.15]It was a neat little game.
[00:48.99]I had fun doing it.
[00:50.42]What's it called?
[00:51.60]It's called Unfair Flips.
[00:55.58]Now, it took me like one hour to beat it.
[00:58.45]But, I mean, it could take an hour.
[01:00.65]It could take 20 minutes.
[01:01.61]It could take four hours.
[01:04.14]Oh, I see.
[01:04.76]I see.
[01:05.14]Okay, I'm looking at it now.
[01:07.70]Yeah, this looks like my kind of nonsense.
[01:09.96]Yeah.
[01:10.08]Okay.
[01:11.53]And apparently there's multiple endings.
[01:14.86]Oh, cool.
[01:15.24]Okay.
[01:16.76]That's weird for a coin flip game, but I'm all for it.
[01:19.74]I wanted to recommend Clover Pit.
[01:22.89]It's a slot machine dopamine game.
[01:26.03]You've played it?
[01:27.05]I played the demo when it was out, but it was great.
[01:29.76]Yeah, that's good.
[01:34.00]Hey, Mr. How are you?
[01:39.44]I said hi Ster how are you I mute it yeah because I didn't want to talk to you but also this game is I think making everything lag for me oh gone fishing does it not work for you maybe it's because I launched it to ask if I wanted directx 12 and I said that's probably good no just do the regular one oh no yeah no I'm doing the regular one that's the regular one that was the default you're so right you're so right okay
[02:06.93]um did you choose this game because it is what your name is for the last three years on steam no this was a recommendation from one of my mods and um because it looks really cool because it's a apparently a very good game to play with your friends because it's been your name for three years that's fine that's okay that's cool yeah yeah it's a good ass name I I like I liked the gas can era of Jerma oh I did that was like I like that season that was a good season of Jerma
[02:39.80]uh let me turn this on um hey hey Ster frame limit if you can that might help yeah do your settings not that I need to tell Ster how to like game like a professional but yeah this game is apparently pretty good I'm looking forward to this we also have crime simulator we can play too which everyone was like ooh yeah so I played um the prequel
[03:08.98]crime simulator what was like what was it I think it was just thief simulator same devs really it was good yeah yeah it was pretty good uh they did a Halloween update that I oh my god that's loud uh but yeah no it's actually solid um simulation nonsense I think you'll you'll enjoy it I think I played a lot it was this was a long time ago this is more than four or five years ago right the first one was 2018 yeah and the second one was a couple years ago
[03:40.59]So I have not played this new one.
[03:44.31]Yeah, it's going to be fun.
[03:46.82]Yeah, I think Poke was finishing up a sponsor.
[03:49.36]Is Poke doing something?
[03:52.34]Yeah, I guess.
[03:53.28]Poke is currently awaiting bail for his farting incident.
[03:58.31]Yeah, that shit's so fucked up.
[03:59.25]I talked about it on stream for a little bit, but oh my god.
[04:02.38]I know, me too.
[04:04.43]Well, that's what the rock with the glass bridge thing was.
[04:07.02]That was some bizarre fucking thing that's going around that I just had to talk about.
[04:11.42]I don't know.
[04:12.00]Something compelled me.
[04:14.17]Just some weird fucking slop shit.
[04:16.79]But, yeah, it's getting weird.
[04:19.15]It's getting weird out there, fellas.
[04:20.93]Like I said, make sure you have a full paragraph that you and your entire family memorize to make sure they know it's you.
[04:29.25]And it's got to be something that only you and your family would know.
[04:33.02]Because when somebody calls... That's the barcode around my belly button that I got tattooed.
[04:39.31]Dude.
[04:40.15]It's like a QR.
[04:42.73]You make that joke, but that... That's... The whole family gets it?
[04:50.46]Wait.
[04:50.80]Why doesn't... No one take me seriously.
[04:54.22]I'm saying that's a... I'm not saying that's a bad idea.
[04:56.38]I'm saying like, ooh, what that's kind of... You said I joke, but no, I have that tattoo.
[05:00.85]You have a barcode tattoo?
[05:02.27]Like Hitman?
[05:04.09]yeah where is it I don't want to know where it is I just said around my belly button okay like around it or across like the top yeah because my belly button is a usb port you need like an authenticator in real life or a code word like guacamole and that'll be fine that'll be good enough we can't use that one now
[05:32.74]But no, no, you have to rotate.
[05:34.26]It's got to be like rotate.
[05:35.18]Every like 20 minutes, you get a new code word.
[05:39.67]Oh, so it's like a, yeah, so it is like an authenticator.
[05:43.81]Yeah.
[05:46.59]Hey, everybody.
[05:47.72]What's up, dude?
[05:50.62]Sorry, I'm at a work shift.
[05:52.58]Overtime.
[05:53.80]No, you're good.
[05:54.36]You're good.
[05:57.29]So gun fishing crashed as soon as I tried to capture it.
[06:00.54]Okay, I started a server.
[06:02.00]Okay.
[06:04.46]And based on the lobby, it seems like a good game.
[06:10.37]Okay.
[06:11.54]How do I join your lobby?
[06:13.14]Yeah, how do I join?
[06:15.12]Let me try.
[06:15.68]This is scary, right?
[06:17.52]This game, I think, is supposed to be a little scary.
[06:21.99]It's okay, Poke.
[06:22.61]We're here for you.
[06:24.66]Crap.
[06:26.20]um are we fucking naked yeah uh can you appear on steam Vinny and poke and I can invite you or maybe just sorry go ahead what why are we naked is this alright gone fishing gone fishing no it's not okay is this just not loading in our underwear what if I just screen shared megabonk you want people in megabonk I could get a crazy run don't get me started on megabonk poke

[07:51.27]I'll tell you what, I'll be this guy.
[07:58.38]Should anybody be naked?
[07:59.56]I think we should all have clothes on.
[08:03.57]You think it might trip like a YouTube detector algorithm?
[08:06.65]I don't know, dude.
[08:07.49]You know what I mean?
[08:08.93]It might trip a detector.
[08:11.88]Alright.
[08:12.48]This has to be my guy.
[08:13.28]I'm sorry.
[08:14.88]I could be a different guy.
[08:15.70]Don't worry.
[08:20.71]I think I'm okay with this.
[08:22.05]What about perks?
[08:26.40]Makes it easier to catch aggressive fish.
[08:31.50]Dude, how about just passively earn three gold every two minutes?
[08:34.09]That seems kind of amazing.
[08:35.03]How about that?
[08:36.87]What is that?
[08:37.39]They said that they're banning that because it's too meta.
[08:42.89]Okay.
[08:44.11]You can do clothes on top of clothes with this guy.
[08:46.44]I think I'm ready.
[08:48.67]Why is this game so high quality?
[08:50.94]Damn.
[08:51.28]Alright.
[08:51.54]Select perks.
[08:56.87]I'm ready.
[09:00.75]I'm not going to take any of this seriously.
[09:04.10]You're going to be fishing next to me and this is going to be a naked guy.
[09:08.44]So what do you want me to do?
[09:11.59]Keep it, I guess.
[09:16.75]There's not really a lot of choices here.
[09:18.76]I don't know if we can all be the guy we want to be.
[09:24.33]Hang on a second.
[09:25.27]Are we just all going to be naked?
[09:26.51]Is that what we're going to do?
[09:27.85]Not even naked.
[09:28.67]Nobody's naked right now.
[09:30.36]It's just you.
[09:30.90]Yeah, I think it's a bug for you.
[09:33.84]I got clothes on.
[09:34.66]I got shorts.
[09:38.81]Do you have clothes on?
[09:40.41]No, I have the Yoshi fit on right now.
[09:43.74]Okay, I'm ready.

[10:14.26]Vinny, you and I look almost identical.
[10:16.55]I just have chest hair.
[10:18.77]You have a lot of back hair too.
[10:21.04]Alright, grab a fishing pole.
[10:26.49]Wait, there's settings.
[10:33.56]Got to put voice on?
[10:34.78]Is it worth it putting voice on?
[10:37.16]It looks like I couldn't turn it on.
[10:43.17]Alright, drop fish into the altar with Q to satiate the lake monster.
[10:47.44]So we have to catch fish and we have to put it over here.
[10:50.14]In this thing.
[10:56.69]The VoIP is good.
[10:58.23]Can we do VoIP?
[10:59.69]VoIP ain't worth it.
[11:00.92]Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to even like, what the push the talk button is.
[11:04.60]It's cap lock apparently by default.
[11:07.06]Can you make it open?
[11:07.90]Yeah.
[11:09.07]Open would be better.
[11:10.19]Hey guys, how we doing?
[11:13.66]Yeah, I can hear Poke through it.
[11:15.13]Hey, can you hear me?
[11:17.41]Alright, we'll do VoIP.
[11:19.25]How do you do open?
[11:22.31]I don't know if there is open, sir.
[11:25.46]There always should be open.
[11:26.74]Yeah, fuck you.
[11:28.02]Can you hear me?
[11:28.88]Can you hear me in game?
[11:30.66]No, I don't hear y'all.
[11:31.46]Oh, it's toggle.
[11:32.24]It's toggle.
[11:33.83]Press cap lock one.
[11:35.65]We have to turn everybody up like crazy, I think.
[11:38.29]Yeah.
[11:39.31]Poke, do some talking in the game.
[11:41.01]Hi, how we doing?
[11:41.72]How you doing?
[11:42.36]I don't hear you.
[11:45.09]Hold on.
[11:45.47]Can you hear me?
[11:51.14]Okay, so you have to hold down caps.
[11:56.10]Yeah, we... Go into the settings and turn everybody up all the way.
[12:02.65]Oh my god!
[12:05.44]That was so fucking loud!
[12:11.65]Can you hear me?
[12:13.03]I hear you now.
[12:14.19]Okay.
[12:14.51]Does it sound good?
[12:16.53]Yeah.
[12:18.68]Cool.
[12:19.28]Yeah.
[12:21.04]You guys can hear me, right?
[12:22.02]Why are you guys cloned?
[12:24.51]Am I really quiet?
[12:25.91]Am I really quiet?
[12:27.29]No, you're loud now.
[12:28.59]Okay, I'm good.
[12:29.37]Okay, I'm good.
[12:30.09]You're good now.
[12:31.30]Alright, I'm good now.
[12:34.16]Someone turn the radio off.
[12:37.22]I can turn everybody down.
[12:39.79]I can't...
[12:45.30]Okay, so here's what we got to do.
[12:46.98]The bait is on the ground.
[12:48.86]My fishing line is kind of broken.
[12:52.35]There's bait.
[12:52.93]There's worms on the ground.
[12:53.91]You pick up worms from the ground.
[12:55.13]Then you press tab.
[12:56.89]And then in tab.
[12:57.65]Are the tentacles in the water normal?
[13:01.84]We got to get fish.
[13:02.46]We have to catch fish so we can deposit it to the monster altar thing.
[13:10.01]Press tab for tackle box.
[13:13.31]That's fucking loud.
[13:19.90]You haven't heard me at all?
[13:22.84]Hello?
[13:23.36]Can you guys actually not hear me?
[13:28.75]Can you guys hear me?
[13:29.51]I think we just go back to Discord.
[13:30.95]Where do we get bait from?
[13:32.63]Oh, I can't hear you the whole time.
[13:35.87]You guys couldn't hear me the whole time?
[13:37.46]My mic's lighting up.
[13:38.92]No, seriously.
[13:42.37]Nobody can hear me in game right now.
[13:44.55]Nope.
[13:45.39]What the fuck?
[13:48.36]OK, well, maybe we should just go back to Discord.
[13:52.60]Guys, is there supposed to be a guy here?
[13:54.80]I failed and I heard a scary noise.
[13:58.95]We gotta feed the altar over here fish.
[14:05.26]OK, I went back to Discord.
[14:11.90]One of your best moments have been VoIP related?
[14:13.62]Yeah, but we can't even hear him.
[14:16.62]It was weird.
[14:17.29]My mic was lighting up.
[14:18.71]The right mic was connected too.
[14:21.97]We're more than just VoIP slot streamers.
[14:26.78]We can do more than that.
[14:28.48]This is it.
[14:28.90]This is definitely my mic.
[14:31.42]Are we drinking beers?
[14:37.53]Where's your bush light, Jerma?
[14:39.03]I actually might have fixed it.
[14:43.72]Can you guys hear me in the game now?
[14:46.57]Uh, do you hear me?
[14:48.73]I could hear all of you guys in the game.
[14:49.81]Can you guys hear me in the game though?
[14:51.17]Like, can you hear me in game?
[14:53.78]I can.
[14:54.94]It's a beautiful talking game, but I don't think I hear you.
[14:57.60]How about now?
[15:01.75]Uh, no, I didn't hear you in game.
[15:04.59]Ah, it's fucked up.
[15:07.71]They're so quiet compared to you.
[15:09.74]Do we just remove it?
[15:12.75]Are we just like not doing the in game?
[15:16.06]I can't seem to get you guys to hear me, so I guess I guess we can't.
[15:18.38]OK, let's let's stop that then.
[15:21.99]Yeah, I'm out here just fishing.
[15:27.58]Alright, caught a fish.
[15:29.02]There's a guy with a plague doctor mask here.
[15:30.91]That's probably normal.
[15:31.83]I think that's how you upgrade stuff.
[15:38.47]bottom left you were muted yeah but it was it was lit up like this like see it down there now and it still wasn't working what is what is this you're having a lot of technical issues dude uh all the other voip stuff worked how much is this worth guys remember to press tab so so look look you get worms from the ground
[16:05.32]When you see a worm, grab it, and then press tab and put it on your hook.
[16:10.08]Yeah, you have to bait your, uh... Where is it?
[16:16.69]This game's very, uh, realistic, actually, like that.
[16:20.03]Well, if it was a toggle, then they'd be able to hear me in the game right now.
[16:24.00]And I don't think they can.
[16:24.70]Yeah, I just turned that shit off.
[16:25.58]I can't hear you.
[16:26.14]Yo, is there... There better not be a fucking jump scare in these bushes.
[16:31.21]I think we have to make a certain amount of money.
[16:42.54]I'll get it.
[16:47.27]Apparently there's gambling.
[16:48.31]You can... Oh my god!
[16:51.95]Wait, is Vinny dead?
[16:52.86]I'm hearing a monster.
[16:54.84]What the fuck just happened?
[16:56.36]It's fine.
[16:56.80]Nothing happened.
[16:57.68]I'm going into the cave here because you can apparently gamble your fish.
[17:02.83]What was that?
[17:03.75]What is that noise?
[17:04.41]There's so many weird noises in this game.
[17:07.31]Oh, it's the trader leaving.
[17:09.19]How do I put my fish down without putting my bra down?
[17:13.20]Come with me, sir.
[17:14.78]I'm on the boat.
[17:15.54]I can't.
[17:16.58]Stay quiet.
[17:17.84]Walk slowly or be hunted.
[17:23.89]How do I take my fish off?
[17:26.34]I don't know, man.
[17:27.41]Alright, you click to take your fish off and then you press Q to drop it and you need to drop it in that altar.
[17:38.69]This is a big one, whatever it is.
[17:39.69]Who's winning right now?
[17:44.96]I don't know.
[17:45.90]Did I break it?
[17:47.36]I don't know if anyone's winning.
[17:48.84]When you click it on the right spot, you just hold left click.
[17:51.70]You hold left click.
[17:52.46]You only hold left click when it's low.
[17:56.20]If you hold left click while the bar on the right is high, you'll snap your line.
[18:00.28]Dude, I got a four and a half pound walleye.
[18:03.79]That's awesome, man.
[18:05.15]I found a beer.
[18:07.91]It's getting dark out.
[18:09.31]I think we need to give way more fish to this thing.
[18:11.23]It has a meter on it.
[18:12.83]Guys, come into the cave here.
[18:13.97]There's a gambling pool.
[18:15.00]Trust me.
[18:15.54]What?
[18:16.70]There's a gambling pool and there's beer and lanterns in the cave.
[18:20.28]What?
[18:20.48]Trust me.
[18:21.95]Yeah.
[18:22.23]I'm coming.
[18:22.61]I'm coming.
[18:23.31]Beer.
[18:23.65]Beer.
[18:23.82]I'm coming.
[18:24.26]I'm coming quick.
[18:24.78]There's beer?
[18:25.46]Dude, there's beer?
[18:28.50]Vinny, where are you?
[18:30.38]I am in the cave.
[18:31.99]I'm right here.
[18:32.69]It says stay quiet.
[18:33.57]We're going to be hunted.
[18:35.21]Yeah, just don't make too much noise.
[18:38.07]This is a huge fish.
[18:39.06]Holy shit.
[18:41.42]How'd you get that?
[18:43.96]I gambled by throwing my small fish in and I got big fish.
[18:47.21]This thing is fucking gigantic, Vinny.
[18:49.89]We got to bring this outside.
[18:51.80]okay hang on but Jerm come here come here check this out limes thank you for the raid hi lime and hi everyone thanks for the raid man alright what are you are you gambling this fish for a bigger fish thanks limes man we gotta bring this thing outside and deposit it come here though come here come here come here beer and lantern guys beer and lantern come here if you're in land that's it you're a clone of someone else so it's hard to tell me until
[19:20.27]I'm here with the lantern.
[19:21.41]I'm here with the lantern.
[19:22.44]Grab the beer, grab a lantern.
[19:23.66]There's three lanterns, one for each of us, and there's three beers.
[19:26.96]Dude, I got a lantern.
[19:30.89]We don't want to leave that fish there.
[19:32.87]We've got to deposit that fish.
[19:34.27]We've got to grab the fish, of course, yeah.
[19:37.10]If you use your mouse wheel, you can have it in your inventory, and you can grab some other stuff.
[19:43.02]How many hours do you have in this game, dude?
[19:45.69]I don't know.
[19:46.09]I'm kind of just winging it.
[19:49.01]I feel like this is a fucking Wallace and Gromit short.
[19:51.35]We gotta get out of this.
[19:52.94]I cannot see over the fish.
[19:54.30]Holy shit.
[19:54.94]Yeah, if you press T, you can get a view of yourself, and you can kind of just go in reverse.
[20:02.29]There you go.
[20:03.71]Keep going.
[20:04.11]You got it.
[20:06.13]The right.
[20:06.71]Wait, who caught this?
[20:08.06]You can throw it in, maybe.
[20:09.30]Sorry, sorry.
[20:10.68]God, the noises are... I'm scared, okay?
[20:13.82]It's alright, Poke.
[20:14.34]We got you, buddy.
[20:14.93]Drop that fucking monster in here!
[20:17.43]Here, here, here.
[20:18.07]I'm gonna drop it for you, so you can drop it in.
[20:20.61]Whoever caught that... I think somebody gambled that.
[20:24.56]Alright, so then I'll throw it.
[20:26.50]Get that in there.
[20:29.90]Dude, that's gotta be worth the next level, right?
[20:36.85]We good?
[20:38.13]Yeah, almost dropped my... I'm gonna have a beer to celebrate.
[20:43.22]It's a good time to drink a beer.
[20:48.06]this game is sick I took it out and I don't think that god knows oh no it knows what happens when it gets to be dark it said we were gonna get hunted by a monster okay I don't I'm just here I'm just here to fish with the boys
[21:12.93]I know, seriously.
[21:14.15]I just put a live frog on my hook.
[21:16.73]Is that normal?
[21:17.43]Does anyone hear fish?
[21:19.44]That's... I don't know if that's normal.
[21:24.36]Can you give me a jump scare mid-drink?
[21:26.18]Thank you.
[21:27.94]Whoever did that.
[21:33.69]The music's getting weird.
[21:37.95]That...
[21:42.02]What the hell is that noise?
[21:43.84]There's a lot of weird noises in this game.
[21:45.75]That's an old 2013 Gmod YouTube thumbnail.
[21:51.31]When the flame is blue, you don't have to donate, apparently.
[21:54.07]Okay, so we're good?
[21:55.84]For now, yeah, for now.
[21:56.72]So what do we do if we're full up?
[21:58.06]We got other things we can do?
[21:59.70]I think we can cook our fish.
[22:03.08]I'm cooking my fish in the house.
[22:04.77]There's a pan.
[22:07.13]Is that another water?
[22:08.47]No.
[22:14.98]Yeah, we need to cook the food.
[22:18.22]What does cooking the food do?
[22:19.70]Anyone knows?
[22:23.67]Oh, I'm just fishing.
[22:28.07]Uh oh, that doesn't sound good.
[22:29.11]I'm gonna cook.
[22:33.96]Nice.
[22:34.82]That adds points or more money when you donate.
[22:40.14]So you can't eat your catch.
[22:41.69]Should we cook the big one then?
[22:42.97]Oh, fuck.
[22:46.20]Apparently it's better if you do, yeah, you get more points.
[22:48.42]Oh, we should have cooked the big one.
[22:50.20]I know.
[22:50.40]It's still here, it hasn't been- Yeah, for some reason it's still here.
[22:53.11]Consumed yet.
[22:55.93]Oh!
[22:56.01]I just got a jump scare!
[22:57.13]I just got a jump scare!
[22:58.17]Hello?
[23:00.18]That sounded like you got bit by a fucking animal.
[23:05.08]Oh my fuck!
[23:06.21]Go in!
[23:06.71]Go in the house!
[23:07.25]Get in the house, get in the house, get in the house!
[23:09.01]Ah!
[23:16.42]Did we all lose?
[23:17.60]I think we lost.
[23:18.62]Yeah.
[23:19.02]It killed us all.
[23:22.59]This view.
[23:23.95]It's like the monster has one of those fear television show cameras on him and he's running through a haunted house.
[23:29.34]It might be my fault.
[23:31.16]Because I took the big fish out to cook it.
[23:34.97]I don't know.
[23:36.95]I gotta make a whole new server.
[23:41.24]Wow.
[23:42.76]The punishment is severe.
[23:44.79]This game is crazy.
[23:46.99]You want to try it again?
[23:48.71]Yeah.
[23:49.35]Alright, let's try it again.
[23:51.69]I was vibing.
[23:52.38]I liked it.
[23:52.96]That was fun.
[23:58.40]It was better than the other game last time.
[24:00.50]What was it?
[24:02.02]I don't even remember.
[24:03.29]Yeah, what did we play?
[24:04.25]Was it digging a hole?
[24:05.97]No, no.
[24:06.39]The digging a hole game was kind of fun.
[24:09.11]It was something else.
[24:10.47]Jackbox and a long drive clone.
[24:15.92]No, not that one.
[24:18.99]Supermarket Simulator.
[24:24.66]There's another long drive clone.
[24:26.10]I posted it in the chat.
[24:28.90]There's a lot of just driving around.
[24:29.92]I think you'd like to join me, Poke.
[24:31.10]Yeah.
[24:32.25]Because I think you went back offline.
[24:33.65]I don't know.
[24:34.77]Oh, Odd Remedy?
[24:35.65]Oh, yeah, because you got bugged and couldn't move like three times.
[24:39.76]I loved that game.
[24:40.40]I thought that game was great.
[24:41.92]No, Odd Remedy is apparently... It gets good, apparently.

[26:32.43]I don't know.
[26:35.15]Remake the lobby?
[26:38.47]Yeah, it's just like not showing you on my friends list in here.

[27:27.92]Oh, why don't you get your ass in here?
[27:30.21]The game is just not loading now.
[27:31.95]OK, reopened.
[27:32.67]There you go.
[27:33.59]I don't know.
[27:33.91]I'm cursed.
[27:36.22]I wonder why I did them last time.
[27:37.56]Send me one of those invites again.
[27:40.06]Hook just wants to play Odd Remedy.
[27:42.20]I know.
[27:44.43]I'm in!
[27:45.05]Oh, fatal error!
[27:46.49]There he is!
[27:47.42]Oh no, he got a fatal error.
[27:50.72]Uh oh.
[27:55.87]For a fart?
[27:57.66]Maybe because I clicked the invite like 30 times on you.
[28:01.00]Did you like that video?
[28:02.67]dude I I gotta admit so dude one of my favorite ones is when you were crashing into restaurants and just putting food in my mouth and but you were acting you know when like a dog gets food from the table and everyone's like put it down put it down no no no no drop it drop it and the dog just kind of sits there like I'm not doing it I'm not doing I'm gonna eat more that's what you were doing in those it's just like a neutral face it's like a neutral face full of food yeah just sitting there like nope nope I'm eating it I'm eating I'm gonna keep it in
[28:35.44]scary shit though yeah yeah it's equal parts like hilarious but also so funny you guys should upload yourself to the system no poke no you guys before listen someone's gonna upload you guys before without you asking you're gonna make a ticket and all that you might as well upload yourself yeah I mean like private it I might as well just like put like a naked body scan of me in
[29:00.45]Listen, listen.
[29:01.95]Someone's gotta do it.
[29:02.99]Increases schlong.
[29:04.58]You can make yourself- I'm here to help.
[29:06.24]You can make it so Mutuals can only edit you and I can put you in my videos.
[29:09.52]See, here's the thing, Polk.
[29:10.90]I caught your stream when you said, I'm gonna try to convince them to do this tomorrow.
[29:16.79]No, I woke up realizing it's probably a bad idea.
[29:21.83]I saw you like, we gotta convince them because we gotta have- it can't just be me.
[29:27.40]which it's so funny to think about that because like I understand that and so in a way right you're like it can't just be me I can't be the one only guy of like that's doing this uh it's it was bad apparently it was like on the front page of the the website they took me down they blacklisted me it might be for the best yeah I don't think the CEO wants some random dude being arrested for farts like 24 7.
[29:57.66]I'm ready by the way yes yeah this is one where you got like thrown at a Twitch con it's like excuse me I got my partner badge and then you run the thing about those videos man is like everybody just starts to run at every other video it's like oh hey dude are you what's up what's your name and the person just starts to sprint away like they're being chased yeah the weirdest thing is like they're trying to make me like get hurt
[30:22.77]but every video is like me falling and staring at the camera smiling like I'm okay yeah that was close it's very weird do you think I'm good he's gonna evolve like with this in mind like they're gonna watch stuff like this and they're just gonna like there's a generation of people that are gonna watch that and just do those things I think so I don't know man it's gonna get weird oh I I did it that's what I'm saying yeah they're gonna look up to it
[30:53.01]Like they're going to bring big rocks across glass bridges.
[30:58.25]Or they evolve.
[31:01.02]And do things no one's ever done before because AI taught them.
[31:05.50]Yeah.
[31:05.72]I think realistically we just all get hit with a nuke and start over.
[31:12.57]That's an optimistic viewpoint.
[31:17.62]I think we should kill AI.
[31:19.22]What do you think about that, fellows?
[31:21.58]Apparently, like, the power usage is, like, a, like, insane amount right now.
[31:25.14]Oh, we, yeah, we've killed a thousand whales just talking about it today.
[31:30.41]Yeah.
[31:34.89]We're all gonna get nuked?
[31:38.21]Ideally.
[31:39.85]Okay.
[31:41.35]This is real fishing combos.
[31:43.78]This is what we would be talking about anyway, I think, if we were on a fishing trip.
[31:47.22]Yeah, man, I'm just telling you, once the nuke goes off, that's...
[31:52.88]Are we good?
[31:53.42]Oh, okay.
[31:53.86]Just a scary noise.
[31:54.46]My mom sent my dad one of the videos, and he thought it was real, but it was like the dumbest one.
[32:00.95]It was like me being arrested, and I had like 100 birds in my car.
[32:04.92]And he thought it was real.
[32:06.60]He was like, what the fuck?
[32:08.10]He doesn't even have license.
[32:10.45]What the fuck?
[32:13.87]Like, I actually have it recorded.
[32:15.27]That's fucked up.
[32:16.61]Oh, man.
[32:17.42]Okay, guys.
[32:18.18]Here's the video game thing.
[32:21.85]I think we have to meet the quota before night time and we just met the quota with the big fish so I think we have to like store all our fish in the house and not be out at night maybe yeah I think once that the scary guy comes we have to be in the house that's that's what I'm thinking yeah smash this beer against my forehead okay so when it's blue we've met quota that I know for sure but
[32:44.43]uh but then what it's gonna be boring if we're all just in the house not doing anything right we could be cooking keep fishing keep fishing and then we'll cook at night and then we'll talk about like nuking the world okay yeah that's that's fine we we can enjoy our each other's company understood I don't know I just want to see I just want to see people jamming spaghetti into their mouth uncannily that's the only way I can be entertained anymore guys
[33:14.77]Who's that?
[33:15.32]Oh, that's one of you guys.
[33:16.60]That was such a weak cast.
[33:18.20]There's another cabin over here.
[33:23.31]Alright, wait, wait.
[33:24.03]We can upgrade our stuff.
[33:25.21]Oh, we're dead.
[33:27.13]I'll play later.
[33:30.46]Oh, shit.
[33:31.02]I think I got a crabber.
[33:33.42]Can I ask you guys for advice on this fishing?
[33:40.07]What is it?
[33:41.28]Never mind.
[33:42.38]Is it?
[33:43.18]oh my god do you hear that noise that turtles make it's on my thing are you doing this oh my god that's scary that's scary that's the turtle sex noise it is talk about that all the time back in the day and then it became blacklisted no one talks about it anymore yeah no you're not you shouldn't it's not good for anyone
[34:11.02]We gotta spread out.
[34:11.92]We need to get more fish over here.
[34:15.40]That was like the point of the internet before, to see frogs doing that.
[34:19.01]To hear the noise.
[34:20.09]Yeah.
[34:20.93]And now it's a lot weirder.
[34:23.73]Yeah.
[34:23.85]Yeah, now it's like Bigfoot vlogging in front of Wendy's with the Loch Ness Monster in like a minivan with him.
[34:32.44]Yeah, holding a selfie.
[34:34.51]Holding a camera.
[34:37.23]Bigfoot reviews the Baconator.
[34:40.31]Bigfoot reviews the Junior Bacon Cheeseburger.
[34:44.33]Whoa!
[34:45.41]Oh, shit.
[34:45.97]Lightning.
[34:46.86]Should I put my fish in if it's blue?
[34:48.24]No, right?
[34:50.70]No.
[34:51.28]Hold on to your fish.
[34:53.38]Maybe you could gamble your fish?
[34:55.60]I'll gamble.
[34:59.15]Dude, I'm making money.
[35:02.71]I don't even know what we use money for.
[35:04.75]Uh, in here, you put fish in this guy's basket and then you can buy stuff from his bag.
[35:12.16]And it's upgrades.
[35:15.06]Uh, we can apparently raise a giant squid from the Earth.
[35:19.43]I want to raise a squid.
[35:20.73]It's $222.
[35:21.53]We don't have enough money.
[35:23.29]But we need to... Is there any more fish anyone got to throw in there?
[35:26.88]I'm throwing fish.
[35:28.00]Yeah, put it in the front basket of the trader.
[35:30.99]Oh, man.
[35:32.25]Oh, not yet.
[35:32.65]I'm still gambling.
[35:33.33]Our fish gamble was not good.
[35:35.87]Is there a cooldown?
[35:43.34]Dude, we got screwed on the gambling.
[35:47.15]Is there like a cooldown or something?
[35:50.23]Maybe it takes a minute.
[35:52.77]What is that?
[35:53.73]I don't know if you can only gamble once.
[35:56.15]What are these noises?
[35:57.96]Why is it snapping my line?
[35:59.00]I didn't keep pressing.
[36:00.93]I think we're... I don't know, Poke.
[36:04.51]That is you, right, Poke?
[36:05.73]Yeah, isn't it?
[36:08.74]In the cave.
[36:09.00]I'm as confused as you are.
[36:10.24]I need more bait.
[36:14.06]Winnings are red and can't be gambled again.
[36:16.17]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[36:18.97]This is awful.
[36:29.84]Dairy sounds.
[36:32.95]Hello?
[36:40.94]Is the totem forever?
[36:45.93]Can you sell fish?
[36:46.57]I don't know if I cooked it or not.
[36:49.85]Are they worth more to sell it if you cook them?
[36:54.06]I got a 10 pound crappie.
[36:58.64]This has got to be worth a bunch of money, right?
[37:03.89]Oh shit, okay.
[37:04.59]I need to ride the balloon and he goes.
[37:10.14]Okay, I bought a sinker.
[37:16.87]I'm still fishing while I'm on the balloon.
[37:20.19]Oh f- No.
[37:22.13]Some could say that you've gone fishing.
[37:25.68]Bye.
[37:26.38]You're gonna crash the server and it's gonna be... Let's see what happens.
[37:30.85]I'm actually catching fish right now from this balloon.
[37:33.18]Can you still drop it in his basket?
[37:37.77]Oh.
[37:37.85]Benny, don't die.
[37:38.49]You're so hot.
[37:40.39]I'm going to totally die.
[37:43.76]There's no way I'm living.
[37:45.22]See you later.
[37:46.76]Yeah.
[37:48.61]You're going over the mountains.
[37:49.65]Get out of here.
[37:54.90]It's so weird.
[37:56.94]Check out Jerma's dumpy.
[38:00.68]Waste of bait.
[38:03.86]Worth it.
[38:05.96]What is it, big?
[38:07.52]Massive.
[38:07.95]Press T. Or you can't see it.
[38:10.35]Someone turned the sun off.
[38:12.81]Vinny, are you still flying?
[38:14.55]I'm still alive, yeah.
[38:18.36]I almost caught a fish from this high up, but yeah, I don't know what's happening.
[38:22.30]I'm sorry, guys.
[38:23.84]I'm sorry.
[38:24.71]If the server lags, it's my fault.
[38:30.03]Guys, don't we have to sleep, or are we good?
[38:32.55]The sun is still up.
[38:41.96]Only the highest quality gaming.
[38:44.71]Yup, this is like digging a hole, but down to where the fish are.
[38:47.97]We gotta get through the first night.
[39:01.78]I don't know, I'm just enjoying the ride.
[39:04.46]Woah!
[39:04.58]I gotta do a... Look, I got a golden fish.
[39:09.75]What?
[39:10.25]Look!
[39:10.75]This thing's probably worth a ton of money.
[39:13.21]It's going crazy.
[39:13.91]Wait, it is gold.
[39:15.91]Woah!
[39:16.75]A 14-pound gold... Oh, it's a goldfish.
[39:20.68]I dare you to gamble it.
[39:23.24]Nah, this thing's worth... It's too precious.
[39:25.34]Alright, we gotta go to bed.
[39:26.03]I think we gotta get inside.
[39:26.85]Get inside.
[39:27.19]I hear weird noises.
[39:28.71]uh guys I don't think there's a secret area here I think that chat member lied to us are you still on the balloon I'm on the balloon still yeah there's no secret area you can't get killed up there probably wait do we have to make food Ster you know what are we doing what's happening I think you just cook them so they they're more valuable when you ah the monster's outside the house right now I think I see him standing there he just spawned him outside the window
[40:00.16]They do not go outside for any reason.
[40:03.99]I don't see him.
[40:06.29]He's outside the window right now.
[40:08.03]I'm seeing him from outside.
[40:09.12]I can't pick these off.
[40:13.04]Out the window to the right.
[40:14.54]He's standing there.
[40:20.17]How close?
[40:21.65]I'll probably be okay.
[40:22.96]He is attached to the house out the right side of the window.
[40:27.80]I'm literally sleeping in the same bed as you and I don't see him.
[40:30.34]Press T. I did.
[40:32.86]And you can't see him.
[40:35.24]No.
[40:36.08]Really?
[40:37.34]Yeah, I didn't see him either.
[40:38.44]He should be out this window.
[40:41.37]Yeah, you can hear him.
[40:42.17]I could open the door.
[40:43.47]Don't open the door.
[40:44.69]Yeah.
[40:50.80]No, I'm just bonding with the balloon guy now.
[40:54.32]Oh, it's because of the angle you hit the bed.
[41:05.17]Are you gonna get in this bed?
[41:07.87]My arm holding this fish right now is insane.
[41:11.77]Yeah, why are we looking at a fish like it's an iPad in bed?
[41:14.06]Like, no, stop that!
[41:16.30]That's the iPads back in the day.
[41:19.20]Guys, I bought beer from the guy in the balloon.
[41:21.95]Did it appear near you guys at all or no?
[41:25.03]We can't leave the house right now or we're gonna get murdered.
[41:27.10]If we leave the house, we're dead, yeah.
[41:32.62]Just drinking beer with this plague doctor.
[41:35.82]Pretty cool up here, guys.
[41:38.29]So was it Vinny needs help and I read it like Vinny needs work?
[41:41.55]Oh Vinny, you need work.
[41:43.50]This guy needs work.
[41:45.08]No, I'm on like a B plot.
[41:46.30]Like you guys are the main plot of the episode and I'm like Lisa getting braces.
[41:51.79]So it's fine.
[41:53.41]It's all part of the same stew.
[41:55.01]It'll meet up eventually back at the end.
[41:58.07]I don't think that we're worthy of the main plot.
[42:01.93]I'm just standing here.
[42:03.15]Yeah, I think you're the main plot right now.
[42:05.62]So how do we go to... I think Vinny, you might need to be here so we can sleep.
[42:10.50]Oh no!
[42:11.43]Here, you know what?
[42:12.27]I'll take care of this.
[42:13.29]I wonder if that's why we can't sleep?
[42:21.52]Music is banging.
[42:23.40]The music is kind of going crazy.
[42:29.25]I'm hoping there's fall damage.
[42:34.42]So how have you guys been?
[42:35.34]How's your week been?
[42:37.50]Been good.
[42:40.16]Yeah, good.
[42:42.53]Good.
[42:42.77]That's nice.
[42:44.75]None too much.
[42:46.43]Oh, he is out there.
[42:48.92]Yeah, he's sitting right there.
[42:50.70]Tell me if he moves.
[42:53.10]Do you have a good view on him?
[42:55.06]Yeah.
[42:56.39]If I open the door, does he move?
[43:00.73]He's still there.
[43:01.45]He's still there.
[43:04.17]Did he move?
[43:08.37]Did he move?
[43:09.05]Nope.
[43:09.55]No, he's still there.
[43:10.88]Wait, is this Vinny?
[43:11.64]Hey, guys!
[43:12.68]Get in!
[43:12.98]Get in!
[43:14.50]Oh, fuck!
[43:16.56]I'm back!
[43:16.76]Okay.
[43:18.38]You made it.
[43:19.40]Alright, so everybody lay down.
[43:26.53]Is everybody laying down?
[43:29.70]Nice.
[43:29.92]We did it!
[43:33.38]It was crazy.
[43:34.26]You wouldn't have even believed my adventures.
[43:37.72]It's just too much to talk about, honestly.
[43:41.29]Hey, you did fly off in a balloon.
[43:42.77]That was kind of crazy.
[43:43.39]It's still dark out.
[43:43.85]Is he still there?
[43:45.41]Wait, it is still dark out.
[43:47.12]He's still there.
[43:49.86]Oh!
[43:50.30]Alright, everybody back inside.
[43:51.50]Back inside.
[43:51.86]Back inside.
[43:52.62]He just crawled away.
[43:55.89]Why?
[43:56.35]How much?
[43:56.69]Did we sleep for 10 minutes?
[44:04.23]Someone's fucking pissing in the toilet in my right ear.
[44:08.27]Don't go out there.
[44:10.76]If you're gonna go out there, you need to.
[44:13.08]You get my burnt fish?
[44:14.08]Let's go.
[44:14.44]I got your fish.
[44:15.60]Let's go here.
[44:16.94]Take this.
[44:19.05]Everybody go back to bed.
[44:26.92]Sure, it's not.
[44:27.74]I see it's morning.
[44:29.10]The sun's up.
[44:29.98]Oh shit, we're good.
[44:31.39]It's like dusky.
[44:35.93]Alright, time to meet the quota again.
[44:38.56]I have enough.
[44:39.08]Oh, we got it.
[44:39.66]We totally got it.
[44:43.46]When am I ever going to meet this quota guy?
[44:45.74]Alright, we're almost at the quota.
[44:47.37]I gave the goldfish.
[44:52.15]How do you do the second part of the fishing?
[44:55.49]Okay, so... You have to look down and up and stuff?
[44:58.24]It is automatic.
[44:59.88]you it automatically is going to go up and down when it's at the low part of in the green hold left mouse button when it gets too high just let go if you hold it the whole time then you'll end up having a bunch of problems it'll snap you only want to click and hold left mouse button when it's really down at the bottom of the bar okay thank you whoa I want to get in there do we all get in here dude that would be a sick fishing trip
[45:28.58]In the boat?
[45:29.70]I already went and adventured.
[45:32.03]I used to do this.
[45:32.67]I used to go crabbing.
[45:33.87]I tried to get as far away from Jerma as I could.
[45:36.33]Well, that's too bad because we're literally right next to each other.
[45:38.33]Alright, Polk, you want to come with us?
[45:39.58]We're going to venture out.
[45:40.72]Oh, you're on the boat.
[45:41.50]Is everybody on the boat?
[45:43.26]I'm on the boat right now.
[45:44.82]Is everybody on here?
[45:46.78]I'm not.
[45:47.44]Well, why don't you get on?
[45:51.93]I'm gone fishing.
[45:53.41]Alright, well, we're going to go.
[45:56.96]Good.
[46:01.57]good it's probably better fish out here why don't we play a real fishing game like Terraria don't you dare invoke the name Terraria why not because it's very addictive who lives here I'd rather play the slot machine game um did somebody said somebody there's somebody here look at this would you do a group Terraria run
[46:32.37]man alright no Ster's gonna ruin it again it's Terraria what is this guys leave an inventory to see depth ah you can see what fish are out there and there's a little catching thing there's a big cave over here those lizards the other side of the lake if you shoot the lake you get a bunch of gems
[47:02.16]Definitely no giant lake monster.
[47:04.84]Somebody has to drive it.
[47:09.62]Let me drive.
[47:10.08]Oh my God.
[47:10.36]I got the lizard.
[47:11.32]This is awful.
[47:12.16]This is disgusting.
[47:16.15]I got the boat.
[47:16.73]Wait, if you just drive towards the fish that I'm catching, I get it instantly.
[47:23.60]Whoa.
[47:25.80]Whoa.
[47:26.60]You get it?
[47:27.56]What the hell?
[47:28.38]It wasn't my fish.
[47:30.48]I have to catch it first.
[47:33.85]This guy does not know how to swim.
[47:37.03]Oh, the trader's back.
[47:42.80]Don't snap!
[47:44.10]Ah!
[47:52.96]Ooh, is that a catcher?
[47:54.54]I don't know.
[47:55.38]It's like a crabbing cage or something, but it's... Let's bring it home.
[48:02.15]Someone said, I really think Vinny playing Terraria would be a painful experience to watch.
[48:06.07]What?
[48:07.67]That viewer hates you.
[48:09.12]Oh my god.
[48:09.76]Why would it be pain- why?
[48:11.34]I don't know.
[48:13.50]I've already streamed Terraria, like, two or three separate occasions over the years.
[48:17.67]It's good.
[48:20.03]Yeah, the viewer just hates me.
[48:23.80]This thing's gonna be big, whatever it is.
[48:25.04]Did I get it?
[48:28.47]You- you just jumped on my line!
[48:31.22]Wait, what?
[48:31.66]Oh no!
[48:32.20]Really?
[48:32.54]What the heck, man?
[48:35.21]I was getting something big!
[48:39.87]Sorry, man.
[48:40.45]I had no idea.
[48:41.21]It was Ster who did it.
[48:45.86]I'm so frustrated!
[48:47.18]Oh, we did it!
[48:48.80]Didn't it?
[48:52.62]What'd you do, Ster?
[48:55.04]Met quota.
[48:56.53]Oh, nice.
[48:56.87]I don't know if I got it.
[48:57.67]I thought you sabotaged Jerma, but yeah.
[49:00.26]No, I'm all grown up.
[49:04.49]Are these rods better?
[49:05.33]When two tunnels are placed, you may enter to travel from one to another.
[49:13.50]Apparently, if we put down two of those chasmacallers, we can teleport.
[49:22.06]And then that horn, it like instantly puts fish on the ground into the thing.
[49:33.64]a crab come on give me it yeah good crap yeah yeah why can't I find any bait okay guys alright alright having the time of his life right now I'm fishing I'm fishing fishing and wishing yeah that we were playing Terraria
[50:05.67]Okay, you can drown, by the way.
[50:07.93]Your Jerma hates torawia.
[50:10.20]Wait, who's this guy?
[50:11.72]What the heck was that?
[50:15.25]Hm?
[50:15.33]Why'd you just die?
[50:16.69]I didn't die.
[50:17.25]That was a doppelganger, I think.
[50:20.09]What?
[50:21.82]Dude, a ver- a clone of me spawned and then died.
[50:24.62]That's scary.
[50:27.91]I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I-
[50:36.55]Why is this shit snapping?
[50:38.59]I need a better rod.
[50:41.94]His body is good bait?
[50:46.06]Oh, can you use his body as bait or Ster?
[50:49.63]Oh yeah, I have his body.
[50:51.39]Okay.
[50:53.73]Well, I guess let's... Get me out of the water!
[50:56.73]I drowned.
[50:58.43]Oh my god.
[50:59.91]You die?
[51:00.32]I drowned!
[51:01.36]No.
[51:02.70]Oh.
[51:03.86]What the fuck is going on here?
[51:09.36]I think I'm just dead.
[51:13.56]How do we get Jerma back, chat?
[51:15.04]Okay.
[51:17.19]You need to note this.
[51:18.67]If you go in the water, you are dead in five to ten seconds.
[51:24.71]Oh.
[51:29.40]It kills you in less than five to seven seconds.
[51:35.83]I think we could use Jerma's body as bait.
[51:38.82]I'm far away.
[51:49.25]Little guy.
[51:50.72]It's probably next morning, yeah.
[51:57.30]This fish is too powerful.
[52:01.77]This fish is too big.
[52:05.55]Apparently there's better rods we can get.
[52:08.44]you can upgrade them at the trader I think it was 40 coins we should do that next time will I get it cool is there a freaking fish at home does it does it disappear like can I drop it somewhere and store my fish I imagine you probably can that thing's huge what is that I'm just keeping my inventory fish
[52:38.69]Oh shit, a paddlefish worth 21.
[52:41.50]I'm gonna put this on the stove.
[52:46.02]Put it on the stove, fella.
[52:50.69]You gambled that thing down to nothing.
[53:00.93]Ooh.
[53:06.64]lucky look at how small that is now okay alright alright alright going from 21 to 28 value that's good you can sell that to the trader and we can upgrade our rods and no yeah definitely upgrade rods no
[53:37.13]It starts being difficult again, Dad.
[53:40.94]Son, I want you to stop what you're doing there right now.
[53:44.51]I want you to... You and your brother need to get along.
[53:47.99]No.
[53:48.35]Or no Minecraft.
[53:49.69]No.
[53:50.62]No.
[54:01.92]And you both have lost two attempts at Five Nights at Freddy's.
[54:06.33]I know we usually do three attempts each night, but we're only going to do one now.
[54:11.35]Should we all go to bed?
[54:16.26]No, we need to play Freddy first.
[54:18.52]It seems like it's bedtime.
[54:20.62]But we're missing Jerma.
[54:23.26]I'm dead.
[54:23.80]You guys just have to sleep.
[54:26.73]Oh, I'm cooking the fish.
[54:30.69]Put a bed boat.
[54:31.09]Put a bed boat, Josh.
[54:32.75]Almost ready.
[54:33.85]Go to bed.
[54:37.14]Okay, hold on.
[54:39.70]Go to bed now.
[54:40.59]Your pants are way too big for you.
[54:42.23]You're shitting yourself, poke.
[54:43.53]Are you cooking them one at a time also?
[54:46.11]You look like a clown.
[54:47.56]How do you know they're all done?
[54:48.50]Just wait until they're all done?
[54:53.45]Okay, I resurrected in the... Ooh, okay, there's a bear.
[54:58.85]Oh my god!
[55:01.36]fucking Christ loud as noise yeah it's really loud also why is this giant fishing rod here do you guys see this oh yeah no no I don't I dropped the fishing rod in here but I don't see it that was weird it's upgraded it's supposed to be huge like that the air is still you're not alone oh does that mean he's behind me or something
[55:31.81]gamble your rod to make it bigger is that real I'm back let's make a little bit of a let's make a little bit of a beer cheese what do you say oops let's make this interesting I don't know how
[55:59.17]I'm going to keep my fish right here.
[56:01.57]Alright, so is it technically daytime?
[56:06.54]Yeah, I'm gambling.
[56:08.98]Alright, now we need to get better rods and we probably have to put this thing in the middle of the lake.
[56:22.24]No one touched my fish on the floor.
[56:26.48]Oh, I got a bug as bait.
[56:28.34]Try this one.
[56:29.34]That was a pretty good one.
[56:33.13]Good gamble, good gamble.
[56:37.01]Time is at the bottom left.
[56:38.98]Oh, it is.
[56:40.92]I wonder when we're safe from the monster.
[56:43.82]Oh.
[56:44.91]God.
[56:45.43]I fucked up.
[56:50.49]I found some bugs in the cave.
[56:53.14]Find TNT to blow up the boulder.
[56:54.94]There's a boulder in the cave that can be blown up.
[56:58.20]Yeah, but you need TNT.
[57:01.00]Yeah.
[57:03.08]What the fuck?
[57:04.18]I saw... Some guy crawling around.
[57:07.71]It scared me.
[57:10.55]That's normal.
[57:11.81]This is normal.
[57:13.73]Oh, a bluegill.
[57:17.53]Um, I'm gonna throw in the sacrifice fish here.
[57:25.00]Alright, we're almost there.
[57:25.84]We only need a little bit more.
[57:27.54]We should make an expedition out.
[57:33.45]And also, after we... Yeah, get a bunch of bait, and we need to get a ton of fish so we can sell a ton of stuff to the trader.
[57:43.04]Okay, I got worms and shit.
[57:45.65]I hear a monster in this water.
[57:48.95]Guys, what do we do with these crab pots or whatever?
[57:52.12]Like, they're green, but... Am I dropping a bait on it?
[57:55.34]Or can you even do that?
[57:56.74]I tried.
[57:57.20]I didn't see a way to do that.
[58:01.12]Sometimes the fishes is too strong and even if you don't hold left mouse button.
[58:05.71]Sometimes it's just too powerful of a fish.
[58:08.73]It's hard to imagine this was a AAA studio.
[58:15.90]Wait, what is $20,000,000 budget?
[58:21.47]Believe juicer that was bait though.
[58:23.86]I keep snapping the line.
[58:24.84]Well, I don't think you can tell when I'm not pressing it, but I only press it when the bar is like almost at the bottom.
[58:31.55]Sometimes I think it's just too powerful.
[58:32.79]Like I'm not, I'm not pressing anything right now and it's still going higher.
[58:36.89]I'm not touching anything.
[58:38.46]Now I'm holding left mouse button.
[58:40.08]Now I'm not touching anything.
[58:42.08]You know what I mean?
[58:50.43]This is big.
[58:53.27]This is a two pound crappie.
[58:55.49]We got where the guy came in.
[59:00.96]Where's my crappie?
[59:04.50]What the fuck?
[59:09.64]Wow.
[59:14.47]Slowed hunger totem.
[59:18.35]Do we need to eat bait?
[59:23.27]Yeah, I don't know what the hunger mechanic is all about.
[59:25.09]This bait sucked.
[59:31.30]33.
[59:34.27]Shit, we need more for a better rod.
[59:36.95]Is it too late for a boat expedition?
[59:39.13]We just farm like crazy.
[59:41.47]I think we just farm.
[59:42.31]It's not even noon yet.
[59:44.88]We should get upgraded and then we go.
[59:51.69]That doesn't suck.
[59:55.17]What the hell?
[60:00.23]Additional rod in-house.
[60:02.19]That's weird.
[60:06.90]This guy trying to dual wield rods?
[60:13.64]You got a 14 pound crappie?
[60:15.18]That's insane.
[60:17.10]Oh my god, I just did.
[60:20.45]Wow.
[60:22.27]That's what the doctor said to my mom when I was born.
[60:26.98]No wonder you want everything nuked.
[60:31.48]14 pounds.
[60:35.20]Of crappy.
[60:38.25]Wow.
[60:42.87]I'm having fun.
[60:43.75]I like to see him.
[60:45.51]I want to see what's going on after this.
[60:47.85]I feel like there's a lot of fun stuff in the game.
[60:51.38]I'm only catching 1.4 pound in shit fish.
[60:56.15]What bait are you using?
[60:58.02]I was using a worm and then I was using a frog.
[60:59.82]Oh, someone in chat said, this is my friend's game.
[61:03.82]You guys are the goat.
[61:04.86]Oh, that's cool.
[61:06.91]Anyways, this game needs work.
[61:08.61]Yeah.
[61:11.81]Next game.
[61:12.96]You need to ask your friend to put all the logos of the horsemen.
[61:17.38]Do we have like a horseman official logo?
[61:19.52]I don't think we do.
[61:20.53]No.
[61:22.57]We need branding.
[61:23.57]We're branding now.
[61:25.90]Yeah, so we can get hats for the Junction.
[61:30.76]Got to be all on it.
[61:31.40]Put the Four Horsemen lava lamps in there.
[61:34.67]That's true.
[61:39.23]That's right.
[61:39.55]I really don't understand the second half of the fishing.
[61:42.62]I know you explained it, Jerma.
[61:43.72]It just isn't making sense.
[61:45.32]Sometimes.
[61:46.14]You click.

[69:13.72]I see the letter O from Kong.
[69:15.19]Once in a while,
[69:18.15]Once in a while, a doppelganger will appear and die, and then you can just take it.
[69:26.34]That's creepy.
[69:28.02]Yeah, it's pretty.
[69:29.22]That's why we play Freddy before Betty.
[69:37.58]I keep getting dog shit.
[69:39.06]I go 1.2 pounds.
[69:41.74]Wow.
[69:42.90]Is that a gamble, that shit dog?
[69:44.87]McDonald's has more meat on it.
[69:50.99]McDonald's remember that oh man McDonald's yeah remember it it's too bad like it's gone now it's crazy if you need to know anything about it I know info about McDonald McDonald's like what was it like McDonald's hook drop a good small burger a lot more onions I swear
[70:18.26]I actually do like those little onions better on the small burgers.
[70:21.98]I do.
[70:23.65]I don't have that anymore.
[70:24.69]Dude, did you guys used to do the straight up plain cheeseburger from McDonald's?
[70:28.73]No.
[70:29.89]That's one of the best ways to get it.
[70:32.50]No.
[70:32.92]The value burgers are the best thing to get from there.
[70:36.94]You get like two McDoubles and like a four piece nugget and that's pretty alright.
[70:43.65]Can I get in this?
[70:46.28]F doesn't work.
[70:48.68]I just love polluting my colon.
[70:50.75]What can I say?
[70:55.61]Hey, Poke.
[70:56.69]I opened the nether.
[70:59.06]What happened?
[71:00.36]Turn around.
[71:02.48]Oh, God.
[71:06.47]Oh, cool.
[71:07.35]Did you ever feel like you could just eat like five plain McDoubles?
[71:10.87]Alright.
[71:11.11]Well, shit.
[71:12.21]Well, the boat's going to be stuck out there.
[71:18.30]How many?
[71:19.84]At least three.
[71:22.49]I like to have three.
[71:23.91]I got three plain though.
[71:25.03]I'm like really hungry.
[71:25.95]A plain single McDonald's cheeseburger.
[71:28.71]Oh, I used to be able to.
[71:29.96]I would eat three or four of those.
[71:32.30]I would get two with like like fries.
[71:36.95]It's too bad they don't have them anymore.
[71:39.97]Too bad McDonald's doesn't exist anymore since the great clown incident of the 2010s.
[71:45.74]Remember when all those clowns were robbing people?
[71:49.11]Yeah.
[71:49.69]Here's a weird thought.
[71:51.44]What you guys are si- What the hell was that?
[71:53.70]What the fuck?
[71:54.46]Oh my god, dude!
[71:55.36]Dude!
[71:55.90]Dude!
[71:56.08]What, what, what?
[71:56.66]Oh my god!
[71:57.02]What, what, what?
[71:58.33]I got pulled under- I got pulled under the water.
[72:00.41]I got pulled under the water.
[72:01.17]You're under the water?
[72:01.67]I'm dying.
[72:02.29]Where?
[72:02.61]I'm dead.
[72:04.98]Oh, fuck!
[72:05.50]I'm gonna drown!
[72:06.78]No!
[72:09.12]No, please!
[72:10.70]Please!
[72:12.03]God damn it, dude!
[72:14.21]It looks like you guys are getting out fished today.
[72:17.11]Wait, where am I?
[72:18.29]Why am I still alive?
[72:19.41]Did we do Koda yet or no?
[72:24.12]No.
[72:24.54]Oh my god, dude.
[72:25.28]I'm really dead.
[72:26.20]I'm kind of horror monster.
[72:27.48]Just dragged me under the water.
[72:31.06]Fuck.
[72:31.80]I went to go see if I could see you getting pulled under and I forgot.
[72:36.31]If you go in the water, you are dead.
[72:39.67]You're going to just die.
[72:42.54]You sink like a cinder block.
[72:50.11]If your feet cannot touch the ground... It's up to us.
[72:55.85]Yeah, you guys gotta save the run.
[72:57.38]It's no problem.
[72:58.10]I think you can do it.
[72:59.34]Are you guys just dead?
[73:00.10]Are you spectators?
[73:01.70]Yeah, I got dragged under the water by some kind of creature.
[73:04.02]Yeah, and then I got dragged under too.
[73:07.43]Are you blowing up the house?
[73:13.79]You wouldn't understand.
[73:15.88]Look at this fucking dead person judging me.
[73:18.64]I just see you drop cartoon dynamite on the floor and then you jumped into the fire.
[73:25.33]And then you saw me do what next?
[73:27.29]Meet the quota.
[73:29.25]Hey.
[73:29.51]That you couldn't meet.
[73:30.92]Oh yeah?
[73:31.70]How does it get halfway in the first place?
[73:34.54]Because of poke.
[73:35.72]I put six fishes in there.
[73:38.09]One ten pounder, one four pounder, one twelve pounder, one quarter pounder with fucking onions, extra mustard and ketchup.
[73:43.59]Jerma, there's a place called Hamburger America in Manhattan that is new.
[73:58.38]I mean, we talked about this probably, but yeah, it's really good burger.
[74:01.72]If you like just a classic burger, it's fucking awesome.
[74:04.46]I want it so bad.
[74:05.85]I've watched so many videos on it.
[74:07.77]Yeah, we gotta go one day.
[74:09.69]But, uh...
[74:11.00]is there good burger in Vegas maybe we can get no no there's really bad food in Vegas Vegas has some of the best sit-down restaurants in the world and all the other stuff that's not a sit-down restaurant is worse than everywhere else I've been to a buffet that's like popular
[74:34.72]There are some, there's outliers, there are some places that are good, but most of the counter served stuff were like subs, pizza, sandwiches.
[74:44.01]What the fuck was that?
[74:45.69]You see that creature?
[74:46.54]I see the creature.
[74:50.24]There are good tacos out here though.
[74:51.54]There are really good tacos out here.
[74:54.06]Oh, but are they like sit down tacos?
[74:57.75]No, not necessarily.
[74:59.33]Gotta stand up and eat the tacos.
[75:02.67]I mean, Vegas has some of the best food in the world.
[75:04.71]It's just, if you're looking for a slice of pizza or a sub or anything to counter serve type stuff, everywhere else that you would be getting it that you would want to get it from is probably better.
[75:17.74]Okay.
[75:17.86]Lay down tacos are way better.
[75:20.86]Lay down tacos?
[75:22.06]The ancient Greeks.
[75:23.52]Eat them on your stomach or in your back?
[75:26.75]They loved laying down to eat.
[75:30.51]They would.
[75:31.39]Those nasty, nasty people.
[75:35.78]Love it.
[75:36.26]They love it.
[75:37.90]Them and their sex rooms and stuff.
[75:44.71]Just ignore me completely, please.
[75:46.54]Thank you.
[75:46.76]I actually am.
[75:48.16]Should we just go to bed for them, Poke?
[75:49.50]Because they're dead and we met Quota.
[75:51.75]We want to keep fishing.
[75:53.19]Hey, there's apparently a revival mechanic in this game.
[75:56.99]How?
[75:57.89]How we...
[75:58.66]I don't know, chat member told me and they didn't explain it.
[76:02.95]Um, Ster, you're doubled by the way.
[76:05.47]You're doubled.
[76:07.06]Alright, that's cool.
[76:08.40]Yeah, I'm pretty sure sleeping is the revive mechanic.
[76:19.90]That dynamite is so huge.
[76:34.82]Hey, we're back.
[76:36.27]Yeah, we're in a cave.
[76:38.11]Look at us.
[76:39.81]We're going to get out of here.
[76:40.82]My mom's calling me.
[76:46.39]Hold on.
[76:49.55]Put her on.
[76:50.59]I'll forgive you.
[76:53.62]I'll leave a lantern.
[77:07.92]Alright, how much money do we got?
[77:11.74]Oh mom, it wasn't real.
[77:14.55]Your fart's a very real poke, I know.
[77:16.89]More AI denial videos.
[77:19.60]Yeah.
[77:20.60]What are you holding?
[77:21.40]That's kind of crazy.
[77:26.55]God, your arm is all fucked up, sir.
[77:28.56]Oh no, that's poke, never mind.
[77:41.89]Come on.
[77:42.75]Give me the big one.
[77:43.39]Did she think you were arrested?
[77:47.27]How far what?
[77:49.29]Did she ask you how you're doing in Megabonk?
[77:52.82]Oh, um... No.
[77:55.74]Because that's my question.
[77:56.66]How are you doing in Megabonk?
[77:58.90]I'm at the part now where I'm trying to get the god build at the end and trying to beat everyone on my friends list.
[78:05.73]So did you do a tier 3 yet?
[78:08.27]Did you beat one?
[78:09.51]Yeah.
[78:10.42]I still haven't, but I just kind of got there anyway, so.
[78:15.37]Do you want any tips?
[78:17.99]Yeah, well, give me a character that you like.
[78:19.47]Give me a character.
[78:20.65]I'll just tell you good tomes.
[78:22.11]XP and Rare.
[78:23.45]Those are, like, they're really good together.
[78:26.00]Who's the best character?
[78:26.74]The other one?
[78:27.70]XP and Rare?
[78:29.06]Yeah, like, you get XP early and you get the Rarity early.
[78:32.26]And put those together, and then, like, those are really good.
[78:35.57]I don't have the Rarity Tome.
[78:37.81]Gotta get that one.
[78:40.90]You mean Luck?
[78:42.34]Oh, Luck.
[78:42.92]Yeah.
[78:43.76]Oh, yeah.
[78:44.42]Okay, that makes sense.
[78:45.46]XP and Luck.
[78:45.96]Okay, fair enough.
[78:47.73]They're really good together.
[78:48.53]They work really well together.
[78:52.15]And what characters do you like, folks?
[78:55.76]Honestly, any character is okay.
[78:59.68]If you're just trying to finish Tier 3, get Quantity, tell them also, and then get Aegis to protect yourself.
[79:06.05]That game is so fun.
[79:07.67]Yeah.
[79:09.92]but I don't want to backseat someone.
[79:11.54]Oh my god, a shark just fucking flew at me!
[79:13.33]Holy shit!
[79:13.65]What the fuck?
[79:14.21]Whoa!
[79:14.75]Oh!
[79:15.03]What the fuck?
[79:16.43]Can we catch it?
[79:19.29]Yeah, we want that, I think.
[79:20.75]Can we catch that?
[79:24.04]Is it coming towards us?
[79:25.20]Okay, I'm baiting him.
[79:26.36]I'm baiting him.
[79:27.54]He's right here.
[79:32.27]No, he went at it.
[79:33.27]No, I'm not muted.
[79:33.99]They just don't listen to me.
[79:35.09]I shouldn't backseat.
[79:35.69]You should just keep playing it and, like, find a build you like.
[79:38.93]Okay.
[79:40.35]It's a good-ass game.
[79:41.33]It's so good.
[79:42.37]I tried to today I was doing um The character Robinette I was trying to like do a gold build just to make it work and I couldn't really get it off the ground ever Challenges to get your tone like your silver up Your weapon locks only like two I should do more right?
[80:00.85]Yeah, you should do a lot of challenges like or not challenges, but like a lot of quests Challenges are good, too The AFK one is really fun
[80:10.06]How hard is it to get out of tier 2?
[80:15.31]It's tough.
[80:16.15]I had to get like a crazy run.
[80:20.32]Pretty easy, I don't know.
[80:23.54]Ster, have you not played Megabonk yet?
[80:26.45]I have.
[80:29.03]I mean, I played it for like 2 or 3 hours.
[80:30.45]I didn't really put a ton of time into it.
[80:33.24]Alright Ster, tell me who's your favorite character in Megabonk then?
[80:36.70]Vlad.
[80:37.84]okay yeah no you're a mega bunker got it no he's great that confirms it yep I like all of them I don't have a mania I thought the monkey was fun monkey is yeah I played I played the demo months ago you kids don't have on me
[80:57.31]yeah I didn't know that the game existed until recently you also said that Vampire Survivors was a bad game and you don't understand why games like that are popular no no no no let's correct the record Ster were you listening to me to go on about this is just why you're bringing it up let's go here uh hold on I found a giant monster
[81:26.41]Do I need to correct the record?
[81:29.25]No, not really.
[81:38.60]We got the traitor.
[81:43.42]Maybe this monster is friend.
[81:48.15]Do we want to do a better line?
[81:52.79]40 gold, I think.
[81:54.59]Yeah, we should probably work towards that.
[81:56.92]Alright, I got... We have a better line.
[81:59.34]We technically have a better rod.
[82:01.28]And we have a sinker.
[82:01.98]So we should be doing much better.
[82:08.85]Got the smallest fish ever.
[82:10.81]I'm gambling.
[82:11.27]It's terrible.
[82:20.98]It's kind of a thunderstorm here.
[82:32.24]Does this affect what fish you can catch?
[82:33.60]I wonder.
[82:35.53]I think there's always better fish in rain every game.
[82:54.16]Oh my god.
[82:57.78]Help me!
[82:57.98]What's happening?
[82:58.86]My whole body is just... I'm attacked by a fucking giant alligator.
[83:01.56]I'm dead.
[83:04.01]Where?
[83:05.03]In the swamp area, dude.
[83:08.55]That was fucking horrifying.
[83:10.63]Oh my god.
[83:11.07]That's the scariest jump scare I think I've ever had.
[83:13.62]Is our quota bad or good?
[83:15.44]I heard real fear in your voice.
[83:19.98]That's fucking awful, dude.
[83:24.09]We need more quota.
[83:25.43]Yeah, we gotta we gotta start really getting a lot more fish.
[83:30.06]I'm fishing in the cave.
[83:31.10]I'm getting some.

[83:55.82]Because I'm that correct.
[84:02.89]That was a crazy scream.
[84:04.37]I apologize if that was loud.

[85:33.68]Really?
[85:34.08]There's two of you.
[85:42.01]I don't know how to get out of here.
[85:44.91]We need you to get out of there, otherwise we die.
[85:49.48]We need you to get out of there.
[85:51.16]Vinny, are you dead too?
[85:52.40]No.
[85:52.88]No, but we have no quota.
[85:59.65]How did you get all the way in here?
[86:02.15]Uh, the TNT.
[86:04.41]Ah.
[86:08.46]Jerma, look at my screen.
[86:12.30]Uh, are you fishing or are you in front of the portal?
[86:14.48]In front of the portal.
[86:20.75]Okay.
[86:20.87]Six-sized fish.
[86:22.33]This is crazy.
[86:25.33]Don't worry about the quota, boys.
[86:28.75]The gamble seems to have helped.
[86:34.66]We're still, like, daytime.
[86:36.52]What planet are we even on?
[86:38.31]Isn't that Saturn?
[86:41.71]Wait, where the hell are you guys?
[86:44.29]I know Jerma's dead, but what are you looking at, Jerma?
[86:47.11]I'm looking at PokeScreen, and he's got a great view of Jupiter.
[86:50.66]Whatever the hell this is.
[86:52.50]just out here fishing oh my god that's an amazingly huge fish did you gamble that yeah it's pretty awesome big fish you sound so sad
[87:20.24]I got eaten by a crocodile.
[87:22.65]When do you get such a big fish?
[87:24.59]I want to get a big fish, man.
[87:36.40]What?
[87:36.66]The timer ran out.
[87:38.50]How much time do we have?
[87:44.79]That fish is not done yet.
[87:46.97]Imagine cooking that thing on that stove.
[87:51.58]I'm gonna throw this one in and see what happens.
[87:54.92]Need a little more.
[87:58.03]Need a little more.
[87:58.87]There you go.
[87:59.37]Yeah.
[88:01.29]Good job.
[88:06.59]You would have one ring of cooked fish and the rest of it would just be raw.
[88:10.32]Alright, you gotta sell that.
[88:15.36]Don't give that to the monster.
[88:16.59]We need money.
[88:17.87]Yeah.
[88:18.39]Oh my god.
[88:20.84]Yeah.
[88:21.90]That's a big fish.
[88:24.99]I think the hacker joined the server.
[88:28.37]He's just standing for me.
[88:29.47]Hello.
[88:32.04]I need your credit card information.
[88:35.68]Do you guys ever have those fish that made music on the wall?
[88:40.43]Oh, Billy the Loudmouth Bass?
[88:42.89]Yeah.
[88:44.33]Yeah, that guy.
[88:46.03]Oh, you know that video of the skeleton that's cursed that dances?
[88:50.30]and goes crazy shaking.
[88:51.79]Yeah.
[88:52.15]Me?
[88:53.09]Yeah, I have one of those.
[88:56.42]The actual skeleton.
[88:59.16]Someone sent me one in my PO box a long time ago.
[89:02.63]Is that the one with the... It's like an older couple and they're like, this thing is possessed.
[89:09.04]And we don't know what's going on about this.
[89:13.66]that's a great video the ending shows like a shot of the dad like the dad he's like I fucking told you he looks so perfect for the role pretty cool yeah not bad pretty good uh who's not sleeping in the name of Jesus oh it was me but yeah that's one of the greatest videos ever made for sure
[89:41.76]I think the greatest video ever made is Jerma does wave 666.
[89:47.92]That's a pretty good one.
[89:51.47]That's a really good one.
[89:53.53]What does that mean?
[89:55.45]He's making a joke that the highest viewed video or piece of content I've ever made is us playing wave 666 in Team Fortress 2 with live mics open.
[90:06.91]It's got like 10 million views.
[90:09.23]Yo, oh god.
[90:10.52]Who's this guy?
[90:13.51]Oh, Jerma, that's you.
[90:15.38]You know what's a better video?
[90:17.66]Wave 667.
[90:22.51]Is that real, by the way?
[90:23.43]How many views does that have?
[90:26.57]I don't know.
[90:27.17]It's at least like 5 to 10 million.
[90:29.64]Crazy.
[90:30.30]Yeah.
[90:32.48]And then I spent like a month in GTA 5 making a fake trailer.
[90:39.05]I spent like three weeks on it.
[90:41.72]And that got like 40,000 views.
[90:44.08]Yeah.
[90:46.72]Honestly, that's one of the reasons I kind of gave up, like, trying, is because I would... No, I'm serious.
[90:53.08]I would go... Guys, listen, listen.
[90:55.05]Here's what would happen.
[90:56.69]I would do this.
[90:59.18]Spoon!
[91:02.79]And that will get 10 million.
[91:05.59]That's pretty good, though.
[91:07.04]But then, you know, I used to go to, like, Comic-Con and interview people and, like, do these pretty elaborate videos and, like, step out of my comfort zone to, like, you know, do bits and, like, you know, be on camera.
[91:18.85]And that didn't do nearly as good.
[91:20.82]So I just said, you know what?
[91:21.76]I'm spinning for a living, baby.
[91:23.30]And I have been ever since.
[91:25.04]Spin the wind.
[91:25.89]nothing wrong with some of that that content's still good I love every video I've ever made even The Witcher 2 episode 1 that I did one episode of and I never played it again I love that video I love them all guys a crocodile just took me and killed me I see a giant beast I'm gonna try to save you but where where were you it just dragged me out to the left when you go outside I'm under the water I'm I'm
[91:49.23]That's funny because I screamed at that and you're just like, hey guys.
[91:53.72]I saw it coming.
[91:54.28]It's just funny.
[91:57.08]I was like, oh my god, I'm going to die.
[91:59.76]Since I'm dead, I have a story.
[92:01.45]I made a, like, when Skyrim came out, I made a video called Top 10 Reasons Why Skyrim Sucks.
[92:09.78]Hell yeah.
[92:11.04]It was like a troll video.
[92:13.82]It was a pretty obvious troll video, but no one believed it for some reason.
[92:19.25]Started getting like a shit ton of views Like 7,000 comments everyone told me you're a fucking idiot like what the fuck like comparing everything I said just flaming me and They just like subscribe to my youtube to hate on every other video, so I had to private it before I got too big Like if you see it now you wouldn't believe it like how dumb it is yeah, and they just couldn't tell
[92:43.04]Yeah, it was like before people... Do you still get some of those guys that are like, oh, this guy hated Skyrim?
[92:49.99]No, no, never.
[92:51.42]Oh, okay.
[92:52.26]Fuck, I love that video that was uploaded.
[92:54.22]Isn't it like one of the first gaming videos essentially on YouTube of you?
[92:58.81]Was it like Call of Duty or... It's like 12 frames a second.
[93:05.24]Vinny, you gotta see that one.
[93:06.70]Wait, how old were you?
[93:07.44]It's like 19 years old, isn't it?
[93:09.80]I'm like 32, but I was on the internet young.
[93:12.68]Oh man.
[93:15.72]Yeah, if you just search Call of Duty 2 gameplay, it's a real video I made.
[93:20.05]It's not even fake.
[93:22.55]I genuinely tried.
[93:23.73]That's a great video.
[93:27.36]What's that noise?
[93:27.88]What's that noise?
[93:28.40]What's that noise?
[93:37.97]How many years ago was it?
[93:38.82]18?
[93:39.64]Was it 18 or 19 years ago?
[93:42.90]It says 19 years ago, holy shit.
[93:46.84]That's gotta be close to one of the first like actual Hey, I'm uploading gameplay, right?
[93:53.39]I don't know.
[94:01.74]It's the Call of Duty 2 demo, so I don't know.
[94:05.51]When I started streaming, I was using, does anyone remember Easy Cap?
[94:11.54]There's a little USB device that would capture your console.
[94:15.96]I streamed my Wii from the EasyCap device, and it was terrible.
[94:20.93]My footage looked god-awful.
[94:24.61]But, you know, that's what we used back in the day.
[94:27.31]You can't stream your Wii anymore.
[94:29.40]You'll get banned.
[94:30.84]I used to watch a four-player podcast.
[94:32.42]True.
[94:33.30]Do you remember those guys?
[94:36.08]No, who's the four-player podcast?
[94:38.29]They're really early streamers.
[94:43.70]Yeah, I remember when, uh, Fraps... Wasn't the free Fraps only like a minute?
[94:48.09]You could only record like in one to two minute increments?
[94:52.35]Oh yeah.
[94:54.50]And then DxStory came out and it was a huge deal.
[94:56.72]The whole program was in Japanese, but it was way better than Fraps.
[95:02.01]I remember that.
[95:03.33]Unregistered Hypercam 2, yeah.
[95:04.95]Hey, remember DivX?
[95:06.73]Was it called DivX?
[95:08.59]Yeah.
[95:09.72]It was like the same quality, then it just went away?
[95:12.17]Yeah, it was like an encoder, right?
[95:13.69]Or something like that?
[95:14.43]Yeah, I just remember it was like insane... At the time, it was insane.
[95:21.00]Are only two of us alive?
[95:23.48]I'm just dead.
[95:24.56]I'm chilling though.
[95:26.39]I'm coming back.
[95:27.19]I was looking for Poke's body and I couldn't find it.
[95:32.05]I got a bunch of fish.
[95:34.56]Do we need to deposit anything anywhere?
[95:36.14]I got a bunch.
[95:37.36]We're like halfway quoted.
[95:39.50]I got a 16 pounder.
[95:53.68]Alright, we have reached quota.
[95:57.32]Oh, good.
[96:03.35]I was there when Will Smith stopped Chris.
[96:11.98]Alright, we got 37 bucks.
[96:15.12]These are pretty decent sized fish, but you know what?
[96:17.57]I'm going to gamble them anyway, chat.
[96:20.97]Should we sleep to bring pokebacks?
[96:24.98]I'm chillin'.
[96:25.70]Don't worry about me.
[96:27.47]You guys, farm some money.
[96:36.72]Do we ever talk about old phones?
[96:40.80]Like an old flip phone?
[96:41.36]I don't think we ever have, no.
[96:43.58]Yeah, like the Razer.
[96:44.37]You guys ever have the Razer?
[96:46.13]Yeah, I had a Razer.
[96:47.41]That was a good one.
[96:48.15]Yeah, that was a good phone.
[96:50.05]I loved it.
[96:50.67]What was the one where it was like a walkie-talkie?
[96:52.47]I was so jealous of people that had that.
[96:55.22]What?
[96:55.94]No, I don't remember a walkie-talkie.
[96:58.89]People in your contacts, if they had the other phone that was this exact phone, you could... A Nextel, yup.
[97:05.06]Those things were crazy.
[97:06.32]Oh, that's cool.
[97:07.16]Oh my god.
[97:07.66]I remember the noise.
[97:09.91]Yeah, you would hold a button down.
[97:11.85]It wasn't call.
[97:13.05]It was a walkie-talkie.
[97:15.45]And if you had somebody added as your Nextel, and you both had to be added, you could actually be like, Hey, what's up, dude?
[97:21.64]Like, over.
[97:23.39]What was the range?
[97:24.67]It was far.
[97:25.21]It was as if it was like cell phone.
[97:29.10]It was crazy.
[97:38.45]Yeah, I always wanted like I would watch the cartoons and I always wanted walkie talkies, but they were a lot like more annoying in practice than they were in theory.
[97:47.76]I even tried making the cup with the string.
[97:50.70]And that did not work.
[97:51.94]That was garbage.
[97:56.14]Look at that.
[98:03.97]I saw like, like, Hey Arnold do that or something.
[98:06.53]And I was like, oh, cup with a string.
[98:08.28]That'll definitely work.
[98:09.30]Didn't work.
[98:10.34]Oh, what about the PlayStation phone?
[98:11.86]You guys ever have those?
[98:12.84]I was so jealous of people who had that.
[98:14.40]What?
[98:14.72]No.
[98:15.57]Who?
[98:16.89]It was like a phone that was like a PSP phone.
[98:21.57]The PSP was so cool.
[98:23.11]I feel like people are...
[98:25.15]Leaping on how cool of a thing that was.
[98:26.53]Those little discs inside of the case, the UMDs, right?
[98:30.28]Those things were so cool.
[98:34.76]Oh yeah, those were sick.
[98:36.89]I never had a PSP.
[98:38.27]Because some of them were movies.
[98:39.83]You could get the movies on those little UMD discs.
[98:41.92]Yeah, the UMDs.
[98:43.18]But everyone I knew that had a PSP hacked it and had like the coolest PSP.
[98:47.80]So cool.
[98:48.48]I did the homebrew.
[98:50.59]Yep, homebrew.
[98:52.33]Because cats would be too into it.
[98:54.67]I had a friend's PSP for a little while.
[98:58.11]I played Crisis Core.
[99:00.13]And years later, I played a couple other games.
[99:02.87]It's got a really good homebrew scene, actually.
[99:10.36]I remember somebody when... Was it the PSP or the PS Vita?
[99:14.63]I remember going to a GameStop one time, and the guy behind the counter was showing it to me.
[99:19.37]He's like, oh man, you gotta see... Was it?
[99:23.17]Are we going to bed?
[99:23.93]Yeah.
[99:25.51]Yeah.
[99:26.23]Don't worry about me.
[99:26.97]Keep cooking.
[99:28.01]Wait, did we?
[99:28.61]Is the sun up or down?
[99:29.91]We have definitely not gone to bed.
[99:32.48]We made quota though, right?
[99:33.96]Yep.
[99:34.26]Yeah, it's blue.
[99:34.62]I saw it.
[99:35.36]What were you saying?
[99:36.44]You got to see what?
[99:37.52]So this guy behind the counter at the GameStop.
[99:39.39]We have a lot more time than I thought we did.
[99:41.19]Do we have more time?
[99:42.63]Yeah.
[99:43.35]Okay, well.
[99:44.89]We get killed by the monster.
[99:46.09]It's your fault.
[99:46.75]I don't know.
[99:48.38]Keep fishing.
[99:48.90]Stock up some money.
[99:49.72]I think it just looked like nighttime because of that storm maybe.
[99:54.25]um but yeah so he told me you gotta see what this thing can do man just check this out he whipped it out he turned it on he pressed a couple buttons and he goes I just turned on my PS5 or no PS4 back home I was like wait what he's like yeah I just turned it on it's you can remote play I thought he was lying and then I thought about like wait well who's gonna turn it off it's like well oh you can turn it off from here but what if you what if you forget what if it doesn't work
[100:25.33]What if it lights on fire?
[100:28.10]I was so scared of doing it.
[100:29.62]I didn't have one, but I was so scared for him.
[100:31.99]Wait, what if you do that one day and you run out of battery or something?
[100:35.36]Your PS4 is going to be on.
[100:36.52]That's a fear for you?
[100:38.77]I don't like when electronics are on.
[100:40.47]I don't like leaving electronics on.
[100:42.83]Dude, that's a fear.
[100:44.07]I don't like when electronics stay on.
[100:45.59]My computer goes off every single day.
[100:46.62]I have the same fucking thing.
[100:48.08]I don't like that shit.
[100:49.12]I'm the complete opposite, bro.
[100:50.30]I turn the computer off, yeah.
[100:51.46]You leave all your shit on, just like on all day, all night.
[100:54.64]Everything's on.
[100:55.17]Your computer can't break if you never turn it off.
[100:57.87]You know what, Jerem?
[100:59.43]I hate to say it.
[101:00.05]I think it's a generational thing.
[101:01.67]It might be.
[101:02.13]I know I'm going to sound old as fuck saying that, but...
[101:05.75]It's like my Game Boy would burn out and the batteries would turn like crusty if I left it on.
[101:10.72]So I would just turn everything off all the time.
[101:13.82]Yeah, dude.
[101:14.62]I've been so conditioned to just... When I'm done with it and I know I'm not going to use it, the computer goes to bed too.
[101:22.44]Yeah, I know.
[101:23.02]Same.
[101:23.58]I understand Poke.
[101:25.06]Because I used to be the same way back when computers were, like, super shitty.
[101:28.92]Yes, you know, you boot it and it would break.
[101:31.80]It's like, well, I'm never going to fucking turn this off because, like, half the time I boot it up, it's like, oh, you have a virus now.
[101:36.95]Yes, it's so real.
[101:39.03]You encounter when you boot.
[101:40.52]If you just never turn it off, you just don't have the issue.
[101:42.88]It never happens nowadays, but I'm telling you.
[101:46.36]That's so funny.
[101:47.90]It's just stuck with me.
[101:48.71]I'm so glad you're with me on that.
[101:50.99]I mean, I turn my computer off now, but for a long time I was like that.
[101:54.90]I just stand up and walk away.
[101:57.44]That freaks me out.
[101:58.72]No, it needs to be off.
[102:04.71]What about like game consoles?
[102:05.87]You turn off your PS5, Xbox.
[102:09.17]I will hold the button on the Nintendo Switch and go to off instead of sleep mode.
[102:14.14]Yeah, me too.
[102:15.64]Every time, yeah.
[102:18.10]Yeah, I just let it turn off itself.
[102:23.24]Who am I to tell him what to do?
[102:29.09]So many things go through my head where it's like, wait, wait, I don't want it to do anything while I'm not there.
[102:33.51]I can't do candles.
[102:37.72]People who do candles and just leave them around, I can't fuck with that.
[102:41.10]I'm sending off a nuke for no reason.
[102:43.34]I have left the candle on and then went out several times.
[102:47.68]It's one of those candles that's in the in the jar like in a jar so I didn't really freak me out but Yeah, what if the jar gets so high it cracks open the ooze everywhere and fucking You're right.
[103:05.70]I know I'm never I learned my lesson.
[103:07.68]I haven't done that, you know, okay I did it somewhat recently, but I'm gonna try not to do it ever again Wait my brain things it scares me
[103:17.38]Your computer needs time to sleep.
[103:18.76]Essentially, nowadays, your computer has a brain.
[103:22.68]It needs to sleep.
[103:23.32]It needs to dream.
[103:24.05]It needs to put things into long-term memory.
[103:27.95]Not me.
[103:28.89]Not mine.
[103:31.10]Go to bed, coward.
[103:34.00]I gotta turn off your microphone.
[103:38.59]You're coming through twice.
[103:40.59]Dude, we got a perk!
[103:44.90]I got a perk.
[103:50.47]Oh, it's the hidey hole, man.
[103:51.37]I turned it off in game, so don't... Don't... Fucking... Fuck.
[103:55.45]That was the most poke-sounding noise I've ever done.
[103:57.78]Holy shit.
[103:59.46]That was you?
[104:00.60]Yeah, that was me.
[104:03.10]There was a meat man outside of our fucking hotel.
[104:05.79]Our cat.
[104:07.07]Uh-oh, guys.
[104:09.01]It's me, it's me.
[104:09.97]Oh, God, you scared the shit out of me.
[104:10.91]It's a meat man?
[104:11.75]That's weird.
[104:18.26]you need to like clear the cache your computer's cache and that like your ram and your hard drive or want to do the same thing the next day I already did probably does it better that's true oh man I have the worst luck with this gambling
[104:41.33]Alright, Poke, when was the last time you turned off your computer?
[104:44.87]That powered it down, and boom, off, lights are off, it's not on, it's literally no power is going to it.
[104:51.22]Like, five days ago when I hit the button by mistake.
[104:54.70]Alright, but before that, though.
[104:55.70]That's not bad, that's not bad.
[104:57.19]Like, intentional.
[104:58.71]Maybe like a month.
[105:00.99]Or two.
[105:02.03]Okay, oh, see that, that gives me, that gives me like chills down my spine.
[105:08.02]Well like I like to have it on if I'm outside and I get to access something I could do remote computer What if I got a Google some real quick and I don't have a phone and also I don't have 15 seconds to wait That's what I've seen that remote desktop shit on your phones it's so cool it's actually really nice I can just load into my phone anywhere and it's like no lag
[105:33.22]Wait, you're like that guy at Gamestop.
[105:36.06]They tell him he can turn his computer on.
[105:39.54]Yeah, you'd hate me.
[105:42.13]See, here's the thing.
[105:43.03]I don't know why I would need to have my computer on when I'm not around it.
[105:48.13]I'm addicted to my PC, so it's like a comfort.
[105:52.30]Just having the option, I like it.
[105:54.30]That's fine.
[105:55.34]Take it away from me, it's okay.
[105:57.56]I'll take it away from you personally, Poke.
[105:59.14]I gotcha.
[106:00.94]You need to set yourself free.
[106:04.03]Help me.
[106:05.59]Yeah, you need to, like, frolic or something.
[106:07.66]That's what I use the iPad for.
[106:08.70]The iPad is for anything that's not... You can do a lot on just a little iPad.
[106:20.49]Dude, just throw it back.
[106:22.15]Throw it back.
[106:22.49]Is it bad we're fishing here?
[106:24.05]Probably.
[106:24.25]Maybe we should go somewhere else.
[106:25.61]If you're fishing in the starting area, I think so, yeah.
[106:28.78]We need better bait.
[106:29.34]I'm down in the cave.
[106:31.42]I'm coming to the cave.
[106:32.34]I want, I want to, I got a better pay.
[106:34.87]Like five pounds, 10 pounds.
[106:38.25]I picked up a tiny one right there.
[106:39.49]I was not proud of that one.
[106:41.42]One of my favorite gags is like, you asked me how big the fish was.
[106:46.02]And then someone was like, how big was the fish?
[106:47.67]It's like this big.
[106:48.57]And you hit him with your arms.
[106:50.41]Hmm.
[106:53.76]There's a guy at a bar many years ago, like 20 years ago in my life, almost, like 18, something like that, and he was like, bro, I caught a fucking bear.
[107:04.33]He was like, the bear was huge, and he scratched me on my arm, and he showed me his arm, and then he tried to nutshot me, but he was too drunk.
[107:11.06]so he didn't quite get me I'm like what are you doing he's like bro and then he tried to get closer to nut me again it was really weird like he was just trying to be like a show off wrong way see that's just like the arabic thing I was telling you like that the kissing thing remember down this way oh wait you weren't there during the sponsor never mind no no what's that what is that it was a huge it was a huge deal sorry you missed talking about alright never mind never mind
[107:37.44]There's the ball allegations.
[107:40.20]The cops are coming for him.
[107:41.90]Ball allegations again, yeah.
[107:43.20]I don't even have a fucking fishing rod.
[107:48.15]Where did my fishing rod go?
[107:50.86]There should be one in a house.
[107:53.38]Did you take my fishing rod out of my hands?
[107:56.54]Why do you always blame me?
[107:58.10]I'm only asking.
[108:00.56]I'm not accusing.
[108:01.36]I'm asking.
[108:02.85]I don't like that you have to always ask that.
[108:06.11]I just walked by you.
[108:08.87]I didn't walk by any of them.
[108:10.44]And was I helpful when you walked by me?
[108:13.88]Yeah, but I had a fishing rod in my hand, and then when I walked by you, I didn't have a fishing rod in my hand.
[108:20.29]I feel like I just tried to help.
[108:22.33]Did I not have one?
[108:25.01]no you're carrying a lantern I don't know should I get a little lesser quota or are we saving for like the eldritch gate or whatever do we share gold I think yeah we share gold oh oh do we all get the upgrades I guess so
[108:57.14]Dude, I got... What the hell is that?
[108:59.02]We get 20% more valuable fish.
[109:01.00]Or 20% increase in all size for fish caught.
[109:03.40]We should get that.
[109:04.08]Ooh, that's good.
[109:05.75]Fish content.
[109:11.41]Increases chance for catching larger fish.
[109:13.74]Should we get the sinker?
[109:16.04]Definitely sinker and definitely if we can do a rod upgrade.
[109:19.68]Did we not do a single rod upgrade yet?
[109:21.55]I think we did one.
[109:22.17]Did we hit quota yet?
[109:22.69]Because I'm going to sell this fish I have.
[109:26.55]We're very close to quota.
[109:30.23]Is there any other fishing rods just laying around there?
[109:33.74]Yeah, there should be in one of the other in one of the other huts.
[109:38.64]Jerma across the way.
[109:39.76]I think there was fish.
[109:40.88]OK, true.
[109:44.67]Yeah, this fish on the floor in there which probably sell it or derivative.
[109:50.77]Tomorrow morning store you wanna go back to the area portal area or no?
[109:55.10]uh we need like one more fish for quota and then we can go do whatever I mean tomorrow yeah oh yeah anything man anything to get you like out and frolic yeah frolicking away from the computer yeah I meant like tomorrow in game oh we get cream barbecue tomorrow in game in game
[110:26.25]So what do you guys want to do when you're in Vegas?
[110:30.02]It's up to you guys, man.
[110:30.80]Show me around.
[110:33.05]Lots of stuff to do.
[110:35.41]Get some good food.
[110:37.01]Explore and shit.
[110:38.34]Get some good food.
[110:39.24]There is some really good food.
[110:45.37]Do the vlog.
[110:48.43]I'm not planning on vlogging.
[110:49.95]Yo, what's up guys?
[110:51.55]Stirr here and with Poke doing a collab.
[110:54.49]This is not real.
[110:55.36]I'm not going.
[110:56.60]Do IRL go-karts.
[110:58.40]That's not a bad idea.
[110:59.32]Stirr, can I give the idea?
[111:01.68]Can I give the idea?
[111:04.17]You can, but it's a lot of work.
[111:06.31]It is a lot of work, but okay.
[111:08.81]Hear me out.
[111:10.27]I was going to pitch this to you guys if you were going to be going to TwitchCon, which I don't think anybody is at this point.
[111:15.92]No.
[111:17.50]So...
[111:17.91]Arc Raiders beta.
[111:19.61]So... What I want to do... Is I want to do... Whether it's whatever event it is... Butchcon would have been alright, a gaming convention would be good, but whatever.
[111:30.44]I want to do a vlog competition.
[111:32.91]Where the goal is, we all have to make a vlog at the same event.
[111:37.09]And we're gonna play them back to back to back to back on stream.
[111:40.59]And chat has to decide who has the best vlog.
[111:44.90]Alright, deal.
[111:46.49]And there are no rules here.
[111:48.92]It's just who can make the best gamer YouTuber vlog.
[111:53.55]Go all out.
[111:59.23]Where are we doing this again?
[112:00.02]I was fishing.
[112:01.80]I wanted to do it at TwitchCon, but none of us are going to TwitchCon.
[112:06.07]Is there any random conventions happening while our UncFest?
[112:10.05]That would be kind of funny if we just went to like a random like hotel convention.
[112:15.74]Yeah, a hotel con.
[112:16.80]Yeah.
[112:17.48]We could just pretend it's a con.
[112:18.91]Like a metal convention, like for metal beers.
[112:20.95]We're going to 95 beers.
[112:24.09]Metal working.
[112:30.34]But yeah, I think it'd be fun.
[112:34.03]I'd go to a furry convention.
[112:36.17]Have fun.
[112:38.06]I gotta recast this.
[112:40.78]I'll wear a mask.
[112:41.80]What the fuck was that?
[112:43.18]The naked guy just scared the shit out of me.
[112:46.81]A COVID mask.
[112:50.27]Jesus.
[112:56.82]You could stare at the camera for 20 minutes.
[112:58.40]You don't have to give any ideas.
[113:00.64]What do you interpret?
[113:01.86]Your artistic creative interpretation.
[113:05.01]But...
[113:05.98]This is very important.
[113:07.78]You have to edit the video.
[113:09.68]You have to make the video.
[113:11.28]Everybody here is like an editor, right?
[113:13.48]Yeah.
[113:14.38]Yeah.
[113:15.09]Everybody here has made hundreds of YouTube videos, thousands of them over the years.
[113:18.53]Yeah, just like how fucking Vinny made his Monster Rancher characters.
[113:23.25]Yeah, a dog.
[113:25.38]A dog?
[113:25.52]I made them.
[113:25.96]I made them.
[113:27.56]I made them, dog.
[113:29.38]You got to edit.
[113:30.08]You have to shoot and edit the video on your own.
[113:36.96]Like I said, I used to do that.
[113:38.20]I interviewed my friend with a sausage instead of a microphone.
[113:41.71]So, I mean, I'm just saying, I can do this.
[113:44.83]I've done this.
[113:45.97]That's pretty next level.
[113:47.90]Star, I'm just saying, but listen, I can do my own homework.
[113:51.32]I can do my own homework.
[113:52.22]Chat GPT, how to make video.
[113:55.19]Have you seen my Call of Duty gameplay?
[113:59.01]No, dog.
[113:59.64]You good?
[114:01.88]Never mind.
[114:02.29]The video needs to be at least 7 to 10 minutes in length.
[114:07.37]At least.
[114:08.94]What?
[114:09.30]Now you said there's no rules.
[114:10.88]Now all of a sudden it's the rules.
[114:13.04]If you show up with a 30 second video, you're disqualified.
[114:16.04]It's 2025.
[114:16.56]It's all TikToks.
[114:18.03]No, you're disqualified.
[114:18.89]It needs to be a... No, I'm not going to give you anything.
[114:23.45]But now it's back to being nothing again.
[114:25.49]Should there be a little bit of criteria?
[114:27.39]Should there be at least one plain out the window film outside the wing video?
[114:32.29]You have to include it at some point.
[114:34.99]Well, that's obvious that everyone's going to do that.
[114:37.08]You don't even have to say that.
[114:38.82]Maybe it shouldn't even be a rule then.
[114:41.00]What if it's footage out the window with some hip hop?
[114:44.91]Chill, lo-fi, chill out.
[114:46.42]Casey needs that music.
[114:50.36]Yeah, whenever I do Comic-Con, I take footage from the boat or something.
[114:55.43]That's important.
[114:56.77]You need that.
[114:58.39]I told Ster some of my ideas for this already, and you should have seen his reaction.
[115:02.20]He was like, dude, you're going to win.
[115:03.32]Holy shit.
[115:06.42]He's a supportive friend, man.
[115:08.04]Yeah, he is.
[115:08.66]It's my cooking.
[115:11.51]How do you tell it's cooked?
[115:13.21]It should be a brown outline.
[115:15.30]I'm colorblind, so... I think they're done.
[115:19.26]God, this fish is too big to cook.
[115:20.88]Yeah, I can't tell the difference.
[115:21.98]It says done in 10 seconds, and then you count.
[115:25.77]I hear something bad.
[115:29.19]If you gamble a cooked fish, does it become cooked?
[115:33.04]That's a good question.
[115:33.80]I don't know.
[115:37.40]Oh, we're so cooked, chat.
[115:42.35]W speed.
[115:45.71]Have you guys seen that meme?
[115:48.04]What's the meme?
[115:49.24]It's like W Speed videos.
[115:51.02]It's actually pretty funny.
[115:52.28]We gotta go to bed.
[115:53.04]I think you'd like it, Vinny.
[115:56.29]Yeah.
[115:57.21]You'd like the concept of it.
[115:58.63]It's just so stupid.
[116:02.06]I'm here.
[116:04.10]And I've got fish.
[116:07.54]So how are we feeling?
[116:08.08]Do you guys want to stay?
[116:08.78]Are you guys having fun playing this?
[116:10.95]Yeah, I want to see what happens.
[116:11.97]Yeah, I think so.
[116:12.57]Keep going for a bit.
[116:13.31]I feel like we're close to something.
[116:15.99]yeah we can summon that portal soon okay there were other difficulties of this so I think it just like scales how many monsters there are and I put us on like normal I think we're starting to see like more monsters I don't know we were worse at the beginning of the game but now we're experts
[116:37.35]I'll go to bed in a minute.
[116:38.37]Big fish.
[116:38.97]Got it.
[116:39.31]Alright, we got- Oh, guys, I got some good fish for tomorrow, man.
[116:42.56]It's gonna be so good.
[116:44.16]Go.
[116:45.56]I'm ready.
[116:52.21]I went to Metal Gear Con and it was not what I thought it would be.
[116:56.38]I was the only one in cosplay.
[116:58.90]Were you, like, Riveter?
[117:00.07]Like... Were you expecting, like, riveting and you got Solid Snake?
[117:08.37]Yeah, I saw a snake and it was just like about fucking construction.
[117:13.34]Son, I don't know how to tell you this, and we get a lot of you freaks, but this is a convention for deers.
[117:21.97]Hey, folks, let's go to the place.
[117:24.15]Guys, guys, my, uh... I had a feeling my, uh... Okay, I had a feeling my husband was stealing from his construction job.
[117:36.90]Want to know how I found out?
[117:39.23]Oh, no.
[117:39.67]How?
[117:39.97]Go ahead, how?
[117:41.71]When he came home, the signs were all there.
[117:46.10]Oh, God.
[117:47.00]Poke.
[117:48.82]That's good.
[117:50.97]That's good.
[117:52.13]That's what a good joke sounds like.
[117:59.86]You guys hear the one about the two peanuts who were walking down the street?
[118:04.33]No.
[118:05.13]It's unfortunate, dude.
[118:06.31]One of them was assaulted.
[118:11.19]Here's a relevant one.
[118:13.23]Did you hear about the pancakes' bad jokes?
[118:17.16]No.
[118:18.16]They always fell flat.
[118:19.42]Wait, this is bad.
[118:20.36]That's a bad joke.
[118:21.50]That's a good one.
[118:23.38]Oh.
[118:25.22]Remember, you lied right there.
[118:26.57]I know you did, but it's okay.
[118:29.07]What kind of cookie makes you rich?
[118:33.41]Which one?
[118:34.57]You know.
[118:37.61]Ritz?
[118:39.31]Ritz is a cracker, you fucking idiot.
[118:43.34]Fortune cookie.
[118:49.29]Where'd you get the bait to fish here?
[118:52.53]I wish I had more jokes, man.
[118:55.01]Fuck.
[118:55.97]I have little cards with jokes on them.
[118:58.60]Are you just reading them, you cheater?
[119:00.00]Yeah.
[119:01.40]Yeah, someone sent me like a pack of that looked like french fries with ketchup on them.
[119:05.16]Bullshit, dude.
[119:06.00]Food jokes.
[119:07.30]Food jokes.
[119:07.60]Come up with your own.
[119:08.45]I thought you were the joker.
[119:11.39]How did the jury find the hamburger?
[119:16.96]How?
[119:18.28]Grilty as charred.
[119:22.90]That's the kind of joke that gets you punched in the face.
[119:25.00]Dude, I want a refund for a gift that someone sent me.
[119:29.75]Like, I don't want these jokes anymore.
[119:31.49]I want a refund.
[119:35.34]Sterb, where did you find bait over here?
[119:37.34]I'm searching far and wide.
[119:40.65]I just came with bait.
[119:42.53]But how could there be no bugs or frogs or anything over here?
[119:45.94]It's insane.
[119:48.82]Meh, meh, meh.
[119:50.65]Why is he crying now?
[119:51.74]Do you hear this?
[119:52.50]What's wrong?
[119:52.96]Why is he like crying?
[119:53.98]Oh my god, what a baby.
[119:56.80]He's crying.
[119:58.47]That's you.
[119:59.87]What's that noise?
[120:02.63]A million crabs here.
[120:03.39]A million crabs in the middle portal area.
[120:06.38]Oh, this is... Jerma has no fucking idea, dude.
[120:09.84]What do you mean portal area?
[120:11.64]You guys have no fucking idea.
[120:13.39]Do you want to see what's like that way?
[120:15.87]I just picked up a family of scorpions.
[120:20.59]Are you next to me with the beer?
[120:21.55]Yeah.
[120:22.51]Yeah.
[120:23.49]Holy shit, there's so many spiders.
[120:24.70]What do you mean portal area?
[120:26.76]I didn't even... I didn't even click and it went away.
[120:28.96]Stop asking, Vinny.
[120:30.64]Guys, I found a hidden cave.
[120:31.90]If anyone wants to come find me, I'm on a boat.
[120:33.75]I'm going to the swamp to the west.
[120:41.71]I think I have a mega... I think I've got a mega donker.
[120:46.20]This looks like a good spot.
[120:48.72]Oh my god, it's actually hard.
[120:51.05]It just breaks his hand.
[120:56.56]You're freaking me out.
[120:59.98]You look like a straff tat character.
[121:06.79]Like my fish?
[121:08.41]I'm going to sell this thing.
[121:09.14]I'm not cut out for this fishing thing.
[121:13.36]Wait, show me your fish.
[121:16.39]Did you waste the bait?
[121:17.33]Sorry.
[121:18.27]Oh, nice.
[121:19.77]I wouldn't even click in that whole time.
[121:21.99]Watch this.
[121:29.23]We're so close to the chasm caller.
[121:36.66]What is tomorrow?
[121:37.86]Friday?
[121:39.18]Yeah.
[121:41.80]Ooh, 11 pounds.
[121:42.58]14 pounder.
[121:47.73]Beautiful gold trout.
[121:49.79]Gold?
[121:50.25]Trout?
[121:51.92]I don't know what it is.
[121:53.66]Sounds like it.
[121:56.70]Fridays are bad.
[121:57.53]I like Mondays.
[121:59.51]Is there any boats in Vegas?
[122:05.36]Is there water in Vegas?
[122:07.46]Not a whole lot of water.
[122:09.39]Is there a nice water boat area?
[122:11.87]They've got fake Venice.
[122:14.01]What if he rented a boat?
[122:15.83]No, the last time I wanted to go kayaking or something, everyone told me I was a fucking idiot because it's too hot out, and I said, fuck you guys.
[122:22.64]Dude, one of the Twitch cons... We got a boat for one of the Twitch cons, and it was really nice.
[122:27.98]I'm not strong enough to... I'm not even clicking, and this shit's going crazy.
[122:33.47]We should get a boat.
[122:35.47]It's kind of the middle of the desert, Poke.
[122:37.69]Yeah, I've been to Vegas and saw it.
[122:40.59]We can get a boat and put it on the sand.
[122:43.10]Dude, we should take Molly and go to EDC.
[122:47.03]Is that what you want your vlog to be?
[122:49.67]Can we do that for my thing?
[122:51.60]Yeah, I'll just, like, stand guard, man.
[122:54.84]I'll be your shaman.
[122:56.22]I'll be your spiritual guide.
[122:58.19]I've been to EDC sober.
[122:59.41]I've been there sober.
[123:01.49]Alright, so here's what we do.
[123:02.21]Everyone was on Molly.
[123:03.34]I just smoked weed.
[123:04.78]poke we all just we don't actually take it we just for your video we just all put tons of water all over ourselves so we look like it's sweaty and shit and we just pretend like we're just there like just going crazy they have like these cool glasses there that make the rave lights look cool it's like kaleidoscope shit
[123:28.54]And that's your whole vlog.
[123:30.33]What on Earth?
[123:31.01]I'm getting attacked by fucking piranhas.
[123:33.85]Also, Polk, if you want to do... I don't want to do that, actually.
[123:39.92]No, if you want to do a boat, come to New York.
[123:42.69]And there's, like, boats where you can eat crabs and, like, tacos on.
[123:47.10]And, like, they'll play music.
[123:48.98]And you can do your Molly on the boat.
[123:52.00]Okay, so for the unction is... Part one of the unction is Vegas is... No, for... Jerma is Vegas.
[123:58.87]And then the second part is New York.
[124:01.17]Yeah.
[124:01.42]For you.
[124:02.28]That might be a while, though, because you don't want to go when it's too cold.
[124:05.96]But... Sadly, right now is a great time for New York.
[124:10.37]I say sadly because it ain't happening, but... Spring is good, too.
[124:15.96]For mine, guys, I'll take you guys to Lebanon.
[124:18.60]I know really good food there.
[124:21.04]Zatar.
[124:25.63]Can I drive there?
[124:28.95]No, it's a long flight.
[124:31.40]Never mind.
[124:32.40]Maybe like Chicago.
[124:33.70]Maybe like... I got someone in this boat.
[124:39.55]It's a big shift from Lebanon to Chicago.
[124:43.44]Have you guys figured out anything else you'd want to do for your part of the unction?
[124:52.51]Let's get a recap.
[124:53.46]The fake parent thing would be funny.
[124:55.82]What's that again?
[124:57.13]What's the fake parent thing?
[124:58.87]Something like a fake parent that we don't know who it is just come in and yell at us while we're playing games.
[125:03.14]Oh, yeah.
[125:03.75]Yeah, I like that.
[125:04.41]So just to, I want to paint this picture a little bit with you.
[125:06.94]So you're imagining there's four beds.
[125:09.36]Us playing Mario Party in real life, like around.
[125:14.41]And just randomly things will come in and happen.
[125:17.08]So there's four race car beds.
[125:19.20]One, two, three, four.
[125:21.17]And where all four of us are in pajamas.
[125:24.49]Right?
[125:25.27]Perfect.
[125:25.68]Yes.
[125:25.88]And then, okay.
[125:27.20]So then, and so then there's, there's like a game cube hooked up to a CRT and we're all playing.
[125:33.91]And this is like a, the set is dressed as there's toys and a big fun carpet.
[125:39.65]And they get to, but how are we supposed to be?
[125:42.27]How old are we supposed to be?
[125:44.81]No, but, like, custom onesies for sure, and we have to, and I have to get one for, like, we have to get one for each, so, like, I would get one for Vinny, and you would get one for Sir.
[125:53.98]Okay.
[125:54.10]And vice versa.
[125:55.04]So, but, and what you're saying is we're playing Mario Party, and then every so often we hear footsteps, and it's like everybody has to stop, turn the TV off, and get, jump into bed and go under the covers before the parent comes in.
[126:06.20]And it's an actor that we hire that opens the door.
[126:08.52]If we actually had to, like, pretend to sleep, and if we make a noise and we just get hit.
[126:13.06]Okay.
[126:14.22]I feel you.
[126:15.42]And this is a, this is like a 50 to 60 plus year old actor that is like, boys, I thought I, oh, it looks like they're sleeping.
[126:21.30]Okay.
[126:22.74]Actors, they can be fucking squeaks.
[126:24.68]And if he catches us, he gets to hurt us bad.
[126:29.13]Actually, that's funny.
[126:32.75]The Batsu games.
[126:33.67]You guys ever see the Batsu games?
[126:35.68]That'd be perfect, right?
[126:37.90]Yeah, if you laugh, you lose.
[126:39.24]You get hit on the butt.
[126:41.90]Alright, so... Yeah, those are so good, actually.
[126:46.59]Alright, so then, Vinny, yours is... You want us to all have instruments in a room.
[126:51.73]And we have to make a song.
[126:54.10]A song.
[126:54.76]Even if it's shit.
[126:57.24]Like, we can... Whatever the extent of your abilities are on that instrument...
[127:01.41]We can make it work.
[127:02.71]Okay.
[127:03.01]And we just make a song together.
[127:04.97]Like, even if it's simple as fuck, you play whatever instrument you're comfortable with and we make a song.
[127:11.18]And that's it.
[127:12.20]I have a question.
[127:13.32]So let's say we make the song, right?
[127:15.30]Yeah.
[127:15.54]What about vocal session?
[127:19.62]Yeah, we could do that.
[127:20.81]Sure.
[127:22.25]What if we just get somebody with a laptop in FL Studio and we just slap some vocals on top after that?
[127:28.13]Yeah.
[127:28.43]Speedrun that.
[127:29.93]I'm down for that.
[127:31.71]You guys can sing too, right?
[127:33.16]I'm sure you all can sing a little bit.
[127:35.58]We could get a song going.
[127:37.60]Yeah.
[127:38.92]But are we actually unctioning?
[127:42.22]Well, Stirrup, we're waiting for what your unction piece is to block it in.
[127:46.77]What do you want to do?
[127:49.37]I think so.
[127:51.78]Well, unction part two, I'm thinking, okay, if you guys ever do end up in New York for unction part two, then we can do mine.
[127:58.24]I'm in no rush for that.
[128:00.08]but like oh god I gotta get out of here what's yours yeah Ster we might be yours again we got to get something from you sir I don't I I don't even know that it's happening he wants a nuclear blast this guy well we're not doing what do you want to do with your friends yeah we're not we're not doing schrodinger's unction right if you could do an unction thing what would it be
[128:23.28]Last time I said ping pong, but like... Okay, fine, we're playing ping pong.
[128:29.13]Dude, we rent out a ping pong place, and we film a ping pong tournament with each other.
[128:34.44]Why not?
[128:35.08]That sounds great.
[128:37.16]Yeah.
[128:39.10]That guy's outside.
[128:39.86]You're all gonna lose.
[128:44.15]Like, it will not be fun for you.
[128:45.85]I get very angry and bitey.
[128:47.43]I told you, I bite and burn.
[128:48.65]Okay, three versus one.
[128:50.17]Let's make it a roguelike...
[128:52.75]If we win a round, someone comes up to you with three papers and you have to pick a perk.
[129:00.66]Right, right.
[129:07.83]I think that was fun.
[129:09.59]Right?
[129:09.89]So we can have Ster only like his one leg is unavailable.
[129:17.20]Meaning I kneecap Ster.
[129:19.19]I'm stronger without my leg.
[129:27.73]yeah I think that they should do that to all real live sports like on TV okay we're gonna hit quota immediately I think we would like we like win well you know what I mean there were other maps if you want to try the other maps I do want to open that portal why don't we just pool our money this time and open that portal just to see what it does they're already dumping it into the oh well I I dumped a bunch not or not all I dumped the ones that I brought
[129:55.37]Can't we take him out?
[129:57.35]Anyway.
[129:59.29]Why don't we have like a grill off?
[130:00.68]You know what I mean?
[130:01.16]Like each one of us gets a grill and we have to make a... See, I would like that more probably.
[130:06.44]You want to do a grill off?
[130:07.24]You would, wouldn't you?
[130:08.20]Okay, while ping-ponging.
[130:11.35]Roguelike grill off ping-pong with instruments.
[130:16.91]I think the roguelike idea is pretty interesting.
[130:20.74]I like it.
[130:21.08]There's someone smarter than me that could figure that out.
[130:23.44]But yes, it's cool.
[130:26.40]Rilla while being tased.
[130:35.56]Well, that's TOS, so we wouldn't be able to stream that.
[130:41.70]If we do the thing where the parent comes in and we have to sleep, should we make it like that show you said where if we laugh, we just get hit by a stick or something?
[130:51.46]Are we allowed to get hit?
[130:52.58]I watched so much of that show.
[130:54.44]Okay, listen, when I worked at Public Access TV, I had the idea of recreating the Batsu game from Gaki no Tsukai in Public Access.
[131:03.80]And it logistically ballooned very quickly because you need judges.
[131:08.07]You need guys dressed in gimp outfits to hit you.
[131:12.51]You need obstacles that are really funny.
[131:14.53]There's gonna be Gimps here?
[131:16.11]We know Squeaks.
[131:17.55]Yeah, yeah, Gimps.
[131:18.61]I know Squeaks.
[131:19.16]He's in New York.
[131:19.82]I'd go hang out with him right now.
[131:20.82]We can Gimp him up in two minutes.
[131:23.30]Oh my God.
[131:24.04]Sorry, Squeaks.
[131:25.54]I'm sorry.
[131:25.77]What the fuck?
[131:26.81]No, Jerma, I'm gonna send you the Gimp outfits.
[131:28.69]Hang on.
[131:29.91]It's not like that.
[131:30.51]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[131:31.95]Squeaks is gonna get this clip and he's gonna be like, what the fuck are they talking about?
[131:35.18]It's a good alternative to Photoshop.
[131:40.23]It's fine.
[131:42.24]There's context, Squeaks.
[131:44.76]There's context.
[131:47.83]Well, part of the Texas Hold'em, because remember, there's going to be a dealer.
[131:56.68]We have to be quiet.
[131:58.58]There's only a certain amount of words you're going to be able to say during that.
[132:02.11]There'll be like five safe words that you can say that anything else is going to get you booted.
[132:10.54]I'm so down to recreate that show, Vinny.
[132:13.92]Dude, that's one of my favorite shows.
[132:15.15]I've watched so many, so many episodes of that.
[132:18.59]We should bring it back.
[132:20.83]You know, it's a shame, too, because they stopped.
[132:23.42]That was a huge thing.
[132:24.52]Every New Year's in Japan, they would have the, you laugh, you lose, at, like, a different location.
[132:30.27]But it was such a massive production, and the guys are in their, like, 60s now, so they stopped.
[132:36.05]But, Jerma, check out that clip I posted, and you can see what I mean about the gimp man.
[132:45.73]This is so loud.
[132:47.69]Yeah, sorry.
[132:50.64]I'll show chat.
[132:51.66]I'm sure they want to see.
[132:54.62]That was so fucking loud.
[132:56.56]I was not expecting a guy screaming right when I clicked it.
[133:04.40]What if we get hit by it with a pool noodle really hard?
[133:07.73]That would be fine.
[133:08.59]That's kind of what they ended up doing.
[133:11.03]Eventually was just getting hit with pool noodles.
[133:17.54]But I want you to like do it so hard I get like a bloody nose.
[133:21.42]Squeaks is currently being informed by his chat about I think he's live right now.
[133:27.73]We're going to gimp him.
[133:28.59]Oh no.
[133:31.17]Poor Squeaks.
[133:31.97]Yeah, he is live actually.
[133:33.05]He's mega bonking.
[133:33.75]Oh, what the fuck.
[133:35.37]Yeah, he's gonna be interested, I think.
[133:38.04]Probably.
[133:38.56]He's pissed.
[133:41.32]Is he mad?
[133:42.60]He is pissed.
[133:47.75]I don't want to dress Squeaks up in a GIMP outfit.
[133:50.35]I just want him to hang out with us while we do Batsu games.
[133:52.86]Punishment games.
[133:53.86]We'll have a safe word.
[133:55.24]We will use pool noodles and it will be fine.
[133:58.18]he said he doesn't know what a gimp suit is oh my god I'll fix this he'll learn please don't tell him to Google that on screen we're at 170 gold with all that selling get some almost there oh get that right no no no no before we do upgrades I want to get that portal can we can we do that do you just put any fish to open it up you know that
[134:25.35]No, no, no, I mean not the portal, the fucking weird eldritch thing with the tentacles that's gonna grow.
[134:30.20]I think that is, I think that is the gate, but... I'm taking shit.
[134:33.74]We... I'm taking a shit.
[134:36.67]We get 200 bucks.
[134:39.53]We need 222 for that.
[134:42.37]Maybe get line?
[134:44.76]And sinker.
[134:47.30]I think rod is not important that much.
[134:49.12]Dude, I'm actually looking forward to Poga the, like, don't wake daddy version of that stream.
[134:56.27]That's gonna be fun.
[134:57.03]Do we have enough?
[135:00.50]Like I said, if you get caught by the... If you get caught by... Like I said, if you get caught by the GIMP, what happens?
[135:09.36]Just like a mild punishment.
[135:11.10]Like they put like gum on your arm.
[135:15.42]You know those scary things that make noise in the hallway?
[135:18.38]I bought the pinnacle, but I don't know what to do with it.
[135:21.69]The Roblox scares?
[135:23.09]You know what I'm talking about?
[135:24.09]It's coming into the hide?
[135:25.33]Put it in the sacrifice?
[135:26.67]I don't know.
[135:30.20]I don't know.
[135:30.58]What do we do with it?
[135:31.58]Sacrifice it.
[135:35.84]It costs a lot of money.
[135:38.30]I know.
[135:38.56]That was too short.
[135:40.73]Oh!
[135:40.85]You can click it and place it.
[135:42.65]Where do you want it?
[135:45.53]probably like right near the house in case something goes horribly wrong yeah that way okay oh my god guys this looks like starcraft now okay um don't be mad at me but I believe if I click this again it's gonna be a teleporter to literally 10 feet away well then don't go somewhere else go down where should I go all the way down to the portal gate
[136:14.82]Squeak said it looks like venom.
[136:16.36]He's down.
[136:17.65]Go somewhere.
[136:18.75]Go somewhere.
[136:20.45]I'm talking.
[136:21.41]I'm hanging out with my friends.
[136:27.08]Wait, isn't the gate over to the left?
[136:32.91]He's chasing me.
[136:34.87]I'm preventing you from doing the two steps away bit.
[136:41.40]Alright, well you tell me where you want to put it because you know where all this stuff is.
[136:45.65]down here with all the um monsters yeah I guess monsters okay so I mean I think we we beat this if anyway let's say if like squeaks opens the door and he's like you kids are supposed to be asleep and one of us gets caught so we just fall through a trap door yeah I like a trap door okay the whole bed goes through a trap door
[137:13.31]considering like people who don't know us too like that we're scared of yeah like like someone like um the drill sergeant from full metal jacket like we gotta hire a guy like that say cool carnage but like a pg version um I was gonna say no I got another streamer we don't really talk to give me a good stern dad I could see that
[137:43.23]This thing just ate me.
[137:48.47]Oh, dude.
[137:49.11]What the fuck?
[137:50.80]I would 100% want a cool carnage to do it, though.
[137:54.12]I've had an anvil fall on my head.
[138:00.30]Ryan would be a good pick for that, for sure.
[138:05.61]This is turning into a major production.
[138:08.75]Jerem, you've done some stuff before.
[138:11.37]You let the fly out for my skit.
[138:13.71]yeah this is getting more and more elaborate every minute every minute yeah we need randu to rent out a new mall for us honestly poke that that was are you aware of that thing that the generation loss thing from a couple years ago actually just found out about it the other day I looked it up on youtube I was like holy this is a whole
[138:40.47]Dude, there was like 26 sets inside this abandoned mall.
[138:44.96]It was nuts.
[138:46.34]It was insane.
[138:47.10]It was great to just put on prosthetics and just be a different guy.
[138:51.75]It was so much fun.
[138:53.27]You reveled in walking around like that.
[138:56.54]What was Jerma?
[138:57.88]Jerma was the puzzler.
[138:59.36]Jerma was like a fucking freak.
[139:02.07]I just drowned, by the way.
[139:02.95]You fall in the water, you slip, and you just die.
[139:05.17]You're dead in five seconds, yeah.
[139:10.95]I'm spectating.
[139:11.55]I don't mind it, though.
[139:14.49]This is a really nice talking fish game.
[139:16.95]It is.
[139:17.29]This is a good talking fish game.
[139:18.19]We can do crime soon, too.
[139:20.30]I'm down for whatever.
[139:20.84]Do you want to do crime while we still have some time, or what do you want to do?
[139:24.42]Sir, do you think it gets crazier, sir, or do you think it's done?
[139:27.79]I think it's done, but there's other levels that we unlocked because we made it past day seven if you wanted to look at another level.
[139:33.97]Do you think the levels have crazier things?
[139:37.32]We could look real quick.
[139:38.28]Any chatters now?
[139:39.96]I'm down, though.
[139:41.24]Chatters, is there an end game?
[139:44.20]Vader?
[139:46.20]Hey, Vader, is there an end game error?
[139:49.31]We're about to lose, so... Let's try to survive the monster.
[139:53.67]...can show up on this or the swamp map.
[140:04.33]Oh, I'm going into the ocean.
[140:05.95]Dude, Poke, have you played the coin flip game?
[140:10.16]Yeah, who just fucking... Oh, you just drowned.
[140:12.57]Yeah, I did.
[140:13.15]I played the demo.
[140:15.40]I loved the demo, and then it came out, and I did a really good round one, like a first try, and then I... I'm just trying to beat Megabonk first.
[140:23.24]Then I go there.
[140:25.16]um gaming is so good right now I'm I'm like really I know dude there's some and Final Fantasy tactics is like really good too that's the remake is like sinking its teeth in me um there's a ball x pit which I'd highly recommend looking up uh Ster poke Jerma I don't know why I'm addressing all three of you by name it's like the the coin pushing thing right kind of well that's rat coin is the coin pusher one that one's gonna be awesome Jerma did you play raccoon
[140:55.03]I did not.
[140:56.95]It is so Jerma.
[141:00.22]What about the other coin flip game?
[141:01.84]Have you played coin... What's it called?
[141:03.96]Coin... The coin... Is it called the coin game?
[141:07.52]No, no, no.
[141:08.06]Coin game is classic.
[141:09.32]I played that.
[141:09.87]That's a cool one.
[141:10.33]Coin pusher casino.
[141:11.63]That is actually a really good one, I think.
[141:13.81]Dude, speaking of coin pushers, do you hear me talk my shit earlier?
[141:19.64]Mm-mm.
[141:19.89]Alright, so I'm going to vent at you guys.
[141:22.01]I'm going to vent at you guys for two minutes.
[141:24.95]So I had this idea, and it's something I might still do, where I hook a channel point.
[141:30.60]So let's say it's a certain amount of channel points.
[141:32.28]I have a real life coin pusher or token pusher that when people spend channel points during a BRB, it drops the tokens in and it pushes the coins and you can do it with a channel point, right?
[141:43.06]Or with a certain amount of channel points.
[141:44.86]Inside this machine will be like little toys and stuff that I have a little case that, oh, that's chat's prize case.
[141:52.47]Just like fun little stuff like that, right?
[141:54.95]So I bring this up to Twitch and Twitch tells me, oh, that's a great idea.
[141:59.30]All of your streams have to be real money casino streams from now on.
[142:04.48]What?
[142:05.11]Yeah.
[142:05.85]It's classified as real money gambling if I were to do that.
[142:09.93]Oh my God.
[142:12.44]You know how they get around that in Japan?
[142:15.84]How do they know?
[142:16.22]They, like, have redemption tokens.
[142:18.53]You can't do something like that.
[142:19.49]And that's kind of what you're saying, right?
[142:20.95]A raffle?
[142:21.23]A raffle ticket?
[142:22.05]You have to have it so they redeem it in a different building.
[142:25.44]Dude, I asked a thousand different ways to make it so... I think what I'm gonna have to do is just make it a... It's a crystal pusher with rocks and gems and... It's not that.
[142:38.16]Okay.
[142:38.61]but uh it doesn't matter I think anything that is pushing anything off of a ledge and yeah chat has is does channel points for it I have to click the classification that it is a real money gambling stream oh that's weird crazy yeah yeah because it's not yeah huh maybe like triggers some gambling part of the brain or something I don't even know
[143:01.32]Yeah, it's weird.
[143:02.66]The SpongeBob pusher is like crystals.
[143:06.09]It's like little orbs.
[143:07.51]Same thing happened when I played Bellatro.
[143:09.83]They said that, like, you can't do that.
[143:13.70]Oh.
[143:14.80]You're being facetious, right?
[143:16.66]Yeah.
[143:17.16]Well, Nintendo said that.
[143:20.34]Nintendo.
[143:20.95]John Tendo.
[143:22.05]Yeah, John Tendo.
[143:24.05]Oh, my God.
[143:25.21]Who's looking at the monster?
[143:26.47]It's me.
[143:28.27]I got him.
[143:28.95]I got him locked in.
[143:34.42]He's lagging, buddy.
[143:40.82]He got you.
[143:42.85]What is he doing?
[143:45.89]Can you get grabbed by him if you go in front of him?
[143:52.38]Vinny, how much skating have you played?
[143:55.02]Only two streams of it.
[143:56.76]I would do more, but it's just this month has been too good for games.
[144:01.07]That game looks like it's fun.
[144:02.80]Yeah, it's glitchy and fun.
[144:04.92]It's good.
[144:05.70]Do you like, like, jumping off?
[144:07.78]Like, doing big ramp jumps and trying to hit the ramps?
[144:10.37]Yeah, dog.
[144:11.79]Yeah, we should play with me.
[144:13.51]Oh, I'm down.
[144:15.53]I'm down.
[144:15.81]He made it in the house.
[144:17.77]Or do you play with your chat and have them all join the lobby?
[144:20.32]Sometimes.
[144:21.40]Last time it happened.
[144:22.60]Yeah, it's really fun.
[144:23.48]What, are you sleeping?
[144:25.16]I'm sleeping.
[144:27.00]Playing with, like, a hundred people is, like, crazy, because...
[144:30.51]They're all doing the same jump with you and they're all putting ramps together.
[144:33.03]Yeah, it's a cool game.
[144:35.84]I love Skate.
[144:36.62]I love it.
[144:39.04]I think you haunted the cabin, Vinny.
[144:42.04]Whoa, that's something bigger.
[144:46.55]Whatever it is, it's huge.
[144:49.30]Um... What the fuck?
[144:53.92]Oh my god!
[144:57.65]Oh my god!
[144:58.32]Why is it so loud?
[145:02.50]Holy shit.
[145:03.20]That was crazy.
[145:12.69]Dude, that was insane.
[145:14.50]Let's do crimes.
[145:15.24]Let's do crimes.
[145:15.90]You want to do some crimes for a little bit?
[145:17.36]I'm ready for crimes.
[145:18.66]I want to do, like, crimes...
[145:21.45]Where there's more time devoted to it.
[145:25.30]It's already late and I'm already a tired baby boy.
[145:27.86]You're tired?
[145:30.08]Yeah.
[145:31.15]If we could do something short, I would want to save crimes for a full thing.
[145:37.75]What's a nice short game that we can play real fast?
[145:40.46]Dude, Lego Party.
[145:46.71]What is Lego Party?
[145:49.25]Mario Party, but Lego apparently very good.
[145:51.44]Oh, so I... Okay.
[145:54.02]That does not sound short.
[145:55.71]It doesn't sound short, but it sounds like there's less brain power than Prime Simulator.
[146:02.10]It's going to be like, tap the button fast to blow up the balloon.
[146:04.52]It's going to be stuff like that.
[146:07.20]I feel like it's one of those games you open and it's going to be so loud.
[146:10.17]It might be.
[146:13.91]As for like really short, for a specifically short amount of time that you may have, Ster, I don't know.
[146:20.41]This game just came out, like, yesterday.
[146:26.72]Damn.
[146:28.12]Uh, we could do that.
[146:30.67]We're doing Lego Party?
[146:34.89]I have a feeling we'll be here a little longer, but I can do it.
[146:39.02]Okay.
[146:39.28]If you want.
[146:39.84]I'm okay with, like, another hour or two.
[146:41.28]It should take, like, maybe a couple hours?
[146:43.12]Hour or two?
[146:44.31]Are you good with another hour or two, Ster?
[146:46.67]Yeah, Ster, what was your time frame when you said, like, real quick?
[146:52.04]um I don't know I'm just like tired and hungry because I started streaming earlier like I'll play but uh what uh have you guys ever played tricky towers no it was tricky towers while this installs I'm gonna go pee though I'll be right back
[147:23.71]Bucks, here we go.
[147:24.79]I'm installing it.
[147:25.62]We can play it for an hour 30.
[147:26.42]49 to 59.
[147:30.86]Alright.
[147:31.68]Give me a minute then.
[147:33.47]What is Tricky Towers?
[147:35.57]We should play it next time.
[147:36.21]It's really good.
[147:38.13]It's like a Tetris game.
[147:41.52]Like a party Tetris game.
[147:42.46]It's actually really fun.
[147:44.38]Can we do that right now?
[147:49.65]Physics-based Tetris.
[147:51.29]It's actually a banger game.
[147:53.24]Is it on Steam?
[147:54.53]You said that, right?
[147:55.52]Sorry.
[147:55.78]Yeah, it's a really good game.
[147:57.41]Alright.
