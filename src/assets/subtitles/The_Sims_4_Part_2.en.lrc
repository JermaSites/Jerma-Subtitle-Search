[00:01.74]Hey, thank you, Peter.
[00:03.34]Thank you, P337R, for the $3.
[00:04.92]Right when the stream turns on, it just says, cool guy, PogChamp.
[00:09.96]Thank you.
[00:11.90]Welcome back.
[00:14.41]When you last left us, we were playing Sims 4.
[00:18.17]We're going to do it again.
[00:18.97]I mean, that was not even a day ago, guys.
[00:22.11]That was like 16 hours ago.
[00:25.97]But two streams in the same day.
[00:27.53]Did you understand?
[00:30.12]Had a stream 16 hours ago.
[00:31.48]Hadn't been 24 hours yet.
[00:36.73]Two streams in one day.
[00:39.31]Jesus.
[00:41.55]Jesus.
[00:44.63]Going for the world record.
[00:45.43]But anyways, hello.
[00:46.11]Hi, hi, hi, hi.
[00:46.73]How you doing?
[00:48.24]We have a couple of additions tonight.
[00:49.80]Those of you that... Hold on.
[00:50.56]Let me shut up and just let the music play.
[00:51.72]We'll talk in a second.
[01:05.47]Hold on.
[01:06.59]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:09.55]Easy here.
[01:10.49]Hold on.
[01:11.54]Dingustown and SheXOXO just both gave five community subs each.
[01:16.94]Right here, right now.
[01:18.68]That's ten community subs.
[01:23.70]Damn.
[01:24.19]Thanks, guys.
[01:25.29]Thanks to both of you.
[01:28.53]That's a big whoa.
[01:34.43]Thank you.
[01:36.88]Fast credits tonight.
[01:40.50]Holy shit.
[01:44.50]Atma Starfish now with five community subs.
[01:48.59]And Spaceman Riff with five community subs.
[01:52.59]Holy shit.
[01:53.43]That's 20 fucking subs in two and a half minutes, guys.
[01:58.33]You lost all control.
[02:01.81]Thank you, Spaceman Riff and Atma Starfish for your five community subs each.
[02:08.00]Thank you guys.
[02:11.19]Generous people doing generous things.
[02:16.36]Thank you guys.
[02:17.98]So, yes, we are going to play more Sims 4.
[02:21.83]A little bit of a difference here today, though.
[02:25.41]Today, I've added a few more mods.
[02:27.84]I don't know if these are going to work.
[02:29.12]They might break the whole game.
[02:30.78]I don't know.
[02:31.16]I got the fucking pets mod.
[02:32.72]Not the pets mod.
[02:33.50]The pets expansion.
[02:35.28]And I wasn't going to buy it, but the only reason why I did was because there's a mod where you can control the pets.
[02:41.45]You can actually do things with them and move them around and make them do things.
[02:44.71]So...
[02:47.51]That could be fun.
[02:50.76]I've also included the drugs mod.
[02:53.34]I don't know what that means.
[02:54.72]Sims can halt you a bunch of drugs.
[02:56.92]I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:58.84]That's there.
[02:59.54]And also, sorcery now.
[03:02.91]Wizards, you can do magical spells.
[03:05.21]I don't know what the hell I've been doing.
[03:07.47]Honestly, I will never be able to play this game normally ever again.
[03:14.91]So, if you think that, like, this will probably be the last Sims, it depends.
[03:20.21]If we're still having a bunch of fun, do you think we can, after, like, the drug murder fucking dog, like, bite people stream, do you really think we're going to go back and play The Sims 4 and, like, build a house?
[03:33.54]I don't know.
[03:34.82]We might have ruined the whole game for ourselves.
[03:38.92]Yes, maybe, maybe.
[03:42.07]Please build a house.
[03:43.27]We'll see.
[03:44.17]Look, we'll get through the meme shit first, right?
[03:53.13]You couldn't go five minutes without shooting someone, and that was with one mod installed.
[03:58.39]I haven't played anything... Specifically because I installed these other mods, and I don't really know exactly what they do, but I don't want to go find out.
[04:08.25]Because, holy shit, last night, just seeing that for the first time was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a video game.
[04:15.51]It was out-fucking-rageous.
[04:17.27]It was totally outrageous.
[04:19.21]So... Let's just get started.
[04:22.72]Actually, I'm going to just grab one thing here real quick.
[04:24.98]Give me like 30 seconds.
[04:25.98]I'll be right back.
[04:52.53]Alright, so let's move over here to the game itself.
[05:10.40]And yeah, so you see, hey, there's that fun, happy family music.
[05:14.18]I got the pets pack.
[05:16.46]This might be a waste of time, but I had to get it.
[05:19.95]So, we still, here's the thing, we have... I don't think it, I don't have a dog yet.
[05:25.71]Can I make a dog and just move it into the house?
[05:29.47]No, I'm not gonna make Otto.
[05:30.69]You want me to put Otto into, like, the drug murder wizard house?
[05:34.13]I'm not doing that.
[05:36.41]You want to subject my dog to that environment?
[05:40.40]Are you serious?
[05:41.92]I'm not going to do that.
[05:42.90]We're gonna make a mutant dog and it's gonna be called, like, Bubbo or, like, Brufus or something.
[05:52.02]We're making like a monster.
[05:53.16]We're not going to, we're going to make like a monster dog.
[06:00.01]It's not your dog.
[06:00.95]It's just a video game.
[06:02.93]No, but it's a projection of my dog.
[06:04.87]And I don't want to see my dog take like fucking crack and like shoot somebody.
[06:09.07]This is going to get, I think that this might get really weird tonight.
[06:16.04]So just be prepared for that.
[06:20.43]Uh, so let's go.
[06:21.09]I have the pack.
[06:21.65]I don't know.
[06:22.83]Can I, like, adopt a dog?
[06:23.91]How do I do the dog thing?
[06:25.13]I know I can create one, but it has to... Can a dog move into its own house?
[06:29.86]Like, okay, if I make a dog, can the dog just move in?
[06:35.70]Here they are.
[06:36.06]This is where we left off last time.
[06:38.04]The Albertsons.
[06:40.12]You have D32121516AD8G Elbertson.
[06:45.74]You've got Gary, Garrett Thompson Elbertson.
[06:49.54]Jeremy Elbertson.
[06:51.22]Wally Wheat Elbertson.
[06:53.59]Frufru Elbertson.
[06:55.35]And Chuck Schnozwell Elbertson.
[07:01.41]Adam Elbertson has since left us.
[07:05.31]Can I make like a dog his own house?
[07:06.99]Like a giant dog house?
[07:11.80]If I pick like dusty turf and I say move dog in here.
[07:19.30]Okay, add a sim.
[07:21.66]Add a pet.
[07:23.37]Add a... Make a mixed breed.
[07:27.73]Okay.
[07:32.59]I don't think I want to change anything.
[07:41.49]Create a child?
[07:44.39]Should I just have a shitload of fucked up dogs in a dog house?
[07:51.31]Hold on, this is gonna take a minute here.
[07:53.19]Elder, adult, unknown parent.
[08:01.21]Like little tail.
[08:05.05]There we go.
[08:06.57]This dog is so ugly.
[08:07.93]Let's give him little legs.
[08:10.96]Tiny little legs, little feet.
[08:17.64]This long sausage neck.
[08:24.26]That's better.
[08:24.74]Hold on, let's go, uh, body.
[08:29.24]Now we already got tails.
[08:30.36]I like the way, uh, no tail?
[08:34.00]Oh, Satan's devil tail.
[08:35.32]Look, that's a devil tail if I've ever seen one.
[08:38.10]Uh, fur.

[08:58.71]It really is.
[08:59.81]What about these other ones?
[09:06.15]Okay, I'm gonna have the goat.
[09:08.22]Yeah, it's got... Come on.
[09:09.52]You're telling me that you wouldn't have the goat?
[09:16.69]That's kind of good goat colors already.
[09:19.79]No, there it is.
[09:20.49]There's the goat color.

[10:55.81]Okay, that looks alright.

[13:23.96]Do not put this trait on a sim you intend to play as.
[13:26.26]This is only intended to put on a sim you want to buy drugs from.

[26:57.73]Ears.
[26:59.96]I need to do detailed editing here.
[27:01.78]There we go.
[27:05.60]That's fine.
[27:06.00]The one I had before.
[27:09.74]Oh my lord.
[27:10.34]Okay.
[27:17.91]This is an owl.
[27:20.75]This is an owl.
[27:22.89]This is an owl.
[27:31.33]Now we have to commit to it being an owl.
[27:36.59]It's an owl with a long nose.
[27:39.19]Hold on, wait.
[27:47.60]Bigger eyes?
[27:48.32]I don't think I can go bigger than this.
[27:49.60]Nah, I want the long nose though.
[27:53.90]Makes him look more marsupial.
[27:58.89]If I could open his mouth very fast up and down, you know that's what I would be doing right now.
[28:04.28]Exactly what I'd be doing.
[28:05.62]It'd be... His nose is fine.
[28:10.96]His ears are fine.
[28:11.72]I like him the way he is.
[28:16.40]Sit.
[28:17.58]Good dog.
[28:24.60]Why does he have, like, the anime character two eye color thing?
[28:28.51]I don't want that.
[28:36.01]Every, like, anime character you've ever seen has this.
[28:51.17]I'm like, that's scary.
[28:58.24]Make him cross-eyed instead.
[28:59.60]Hold on.
[28:59.98]Let's make him... Jesus.
[29:03.63]Make him cross-eyed?
[29:08.35]I'll try.
[29:08.79]Hold on.
[29:13.74]Gotta get the corner.
[29:21.68]Turn his eyes.
[29:22.56]Tilt his eyes.
[29:23.64]Okay, I guess that's as far as I can go.
[29:26.46]Yeah, it's better like this.
[29:29.24]This is kind of like frog eyes.
[29:35.43]This is my favorite one so far.
[29:40.77]This is just taking two... This is the animal DNA machine.
[29:43.21]It really is.
[29:44.39]Look at how fucked up that is down there.
[29:46.33]That's Tom Crow from MST3K down there.
[30:00.42]That's fine.
[30:00.98]Alright, so here we go.
[30:02.14]We're going to name this one.
[30:05.90]How many animals can I have in the house?
[30:15.83]He's a roommate with pill.
[30:17.43]Okay, yeah, that's fine.
[30:21.81]Okay, the name is... What's the name for this?
[30:24.97]That's a good owl name.
[30:35.87]Name him Mike.
[30:41.45]Crow.
[30:44.35]Name him Tootsie Pop.
[30:46.51]Tootsie Pop actually is a pretty great name.
[30:50.18]I like Tootsie Pop.
[30:51.54]That's great.
[30:56.26]Tootsie Pop.
[30:58.70]Tootsie Pop Creep.
[31:01.48]Okay, let's add another one.
[31:08.01]Can we get another cat in here?
[31:13.05]Alright, cat.
[31:13.63]Let's make an old cat.
[31:18.87]Okay, let's make this one.
[31:20.67]Randomized sister.
[31:23.80]Oh, go back!
[31:24.38]How do I go back?
[31:24.96]That one looked... That one looked pretty haggard.
[31:28.22]Oh my goodness, look at that eye.
[31:29.38]That's it.
[31:34.26]Say it.
[31:34.96]I want to see it.
[31:35.56]Say it.
[31:36.00]Say it.
[31:36.46]Say it.
[31:36.94]Say it.
[31:39.67]And it's gone.
[31:45.37]That's a pretty good start.
[31:47.59]No.
[31:49.25]No.
[31:51.87]No.
[31:53.70]No.
[31:55.24]Yes.
[31:56.64]That's a pretty... Yes.
[31:57.60]That's a pretty good start.
[31:59.90]Ears.
[32:00.78]Get over there.
[32:02.74]Head shape.
[32:09.37]Give him the Wilford Brimley cat thing.
[32:11.23]Okay, there you go.
[32:29.04]Got to get into detail mode.
[32:42.92]Stop doing genetics.
[32:44.28]It makes monsters.
[32:46.04]It actually looks like he has hair up here.
[32:48.85]Parted backwards.
[32:49.69]Bald.
[32:52.55]It's a Boston Terrier cat.
[32:53.99]Okay, ears are fine.
[32:56.01]What about the nose?
[32:56.91]We got the nose already.
[33:00.19]Is it whiskers?
[33:01.64]Okay, that's alright.
[33:05.70]Let's go back a little.
[33:06.70]Let's get just his body.
[33:10.26]Make him bigger.
[33:14.52]Detail edit.
[33:14.92]Let's see if I can move the eyes a little bit more.
[33:18.50]Come on, where is it?
[33:22.66]Holy shit.
[33:23.64]Perfect.
[33:26.11]Fucking evil ass motherfucker here.
[33:27.99]Okay.
[33:28.09]Okay.
[33:39.27]Do a huge note like that, right?
[33:41.47]Looks good.
[33:44.96]Make sure you can see those eyes.
[33:46.16]That's better.
[33:46.59]Looking good so far.
[33:57.08]Little baby feet.
[34:02.64]Okay.
[34:04.28]Go to the eyes.
[34:04.76]What do we got for eyes?
[34:17.69]Let's change that back so we get the evil there.
[34:24.36]Detail both of them.
[34:27.78]There we go, those are bigger.
[34:29.26]More menacing.
[34:38.93]Yeah, that looks a lot better.
[34:44.23]Okay, I think you're good.
[34:46.63]Now what are you gonna be like?
[34:53.56]That sounds pretty good.
[34:55.32]Owner, owner, look at these.
[34:58.58]Look at these.
[35:01.52]This one's the best.
[35:03.50]That looks like a gerbil.
[35:07.06]Or like a hamster.
[35:08.22]That's like a hamster took a selfie.
[35:16.08]Okay, that looks good.
[35:17.64]This is all fine.
[35:18.86]Well, my name is you grumpy cat.
[35:23.02]How about Orson over the counter?
[35:26.84]OTC Orson?
[35:29.40]I don't know.
[35:37.38]OTC Orson.
[35:40.24]Of course, he's a creep.
[35:45.27]Use paint mode?
[35:45.95]I will.
[35:47.87]I'll paint them.
[35:50.23]Alright, so hold on.
[35:50.83]Paint mode.
[35:52.17]This is the best one.
[35:55.27]I love this one.
[35:56.13]Alright, so paint.
[35:59.65]Oh dear.
[36:00.31]No, no, no, no.
[36:01.23]I don't want to ruin you.
[36:02.05]I don't want to ruin this one.
[36:16.06]Why did I just do that?
[36:17.02]I don't know why I did that.
[36:18.82]Why did I just do that?
[36:21.80]There was no reason for that.
[36:22.76]That was just disgusting.
[36:30.42]How do I undo?
[36:32.89]Is there an undo?
[36:34.49]No, I'm not doing that.
[36:36.23]That's disgusting and I don't want it.
[36:38.25]How do I undo?
[36:39.69]Clear all.
[36:40.79]No, that's not happening.
[36:49.87]I'm not doing it.
[36:50.59]Okay, here we go.
[37:01.49]You're not big enough for this.
[37:02.85]Zoom in.
[37:04.97]Detail paint mode.
[37:06.87]Yeah, I want to... I need to be able to go down.
[37:13.07]I want to go down.
[37:21.88]Without hesitation, I went for the most shit accurate shade of green frown.
[37:29.23]Let's give him a bowtie!
[37:30.39]Okay, actually, he should have a bowtie.
[37:36.04]Oh man, that's so dumb.
[37:54.16]Is that too big?
[37:54.82]No, it's too big.
[38:04.10]No, it's not blue.
[38:05.58]It's got to be a matching color.
[38:07.72]Bigger.
[38:08.12]No, I'm not going to make it bigger.
[38:12.34]That's good.
[38:14.08]Make it red?
[38:15.88]Let's try red.
[38:28.29]That's okay.
[38:29.53]That looks alright.
[38:42.07]Shit stains.
[38:44.11]Alright, we'll try it.
[38:44.95]Somebody said green.
[38:47.59]Ooh, hold on.
[38:48.97]What about just a, oh, black.
[38:50.11]I like black.
[38:51.92]What about like, what about brown?
[38:57.49]What about this color?
[38:59.93]The color of his hair.
[39:01.49]That's kind of good, actually.
[39:02.63]Yeah, that's good.
[39:03.17]That matches.
[39:03.59]It looks like his hair was made that way.
[39:09.85]Okay.
[39:15.49]Nope.
[39:16.05]You thought you were going to get it.
[39:19.06]No, I can't do this shit.
[39:20.74]You know how many people would think I was a fucking child if I'd cover this cat's ass in shit and we had to look at it every single time he turned around?
[39:28.03]Every single time.
[39:31.19]I mean, it's funny to see that for like 15 seconds, but after four hours of this cat's ass covered in shit, it's not gonna, it's gonna be like, I don't, it's gross.
[39:40.93]I don't want to see it.
[39:51.78]Somebody said give him lipstick.
[39:54.86]I'll try.
[39:57.76]Where's the brushes?
[40:00.76]No.
[40:02.32]This is the regular default brush.
[40:03.86]Do I have it?
[40:04.24]Oh, the stamp there is.
[40:04.90]Okay.
[40:06.06]Give him lipstick.
[40:17.47]I don't think I'm going to be able to...
[40:34.42]Why would he?
[40:35.08]What?
[40:41.78]I may have overshot a little bit here.
[40:52.24]Less?
[40:52.62]No, that's how it's staying.
[40:54.00]Okay, what about like big eyebrows?
[41:01.98]No.
[41:03.04]No!
[41:06.61]Oh, I thought that was un... I thought that was undo, not clear.
[41:15.22]You got that circle button in my brain.
[41:17.48]It's alright.
[41:17.86]We can do this in two seconds.
[41:25.15]Where's the bow tie?
[41:25.75]There it is.
[41:26.21]Red.
[41:27.23]Same color as him.
[41:28.05]Uh-huh.
[41:33.75]Okay, bow tie.
[41:34.87]Pick the color.
[41:35.65]This one.
[41:45.62]One more.
[41:46.16]Darken it a little bit.
[41:47.74]Good.
[41:49.10]Okay, let's get the lipstick back.
[41:53.61]This one is fine.
[41:55.49]Shrink that size.
[41:56.47]Get that nice bright pink lipstick.
[41:59.03]Let's try pink.
[42:08.85]That looks like the cat just drank a bunch of Kool-Aid.
[42:16.46]Should the cat just have Kool-Aid all over him?
[42:21.82]Just drank a bunch of raspberry Kool-Aid?
[42:32.18]Make the lipstick black.
[42:43.09]Now that doesn't work.
[42:52.79]Let's go back to the original red we had.
[42:54.37]That was fine.
[42:55.03]We're just like blue.
[42:56.62]This is like a drug cat, right?
[43:00.04]Wouldn't it be like, we're going to do the blue crystal or something.
[43:04.06]This is fine.
[43:04.50]Okay.
[43:04.76]Brush size like five or six.
[43:21.43]Okay, that's good.
[43:23.55]I did want to draw the eyebrows on too.
[43:50.64]No eyebrows.
[43:51.56]No, that's stupid.
[43:52.44]How about just like something on the ass?
[43:56.25]I'm going to draw a fake underwear on the cat, like a fake diaper.
[44:00.48]That works.
[44:00.84]I like that idea.
[44:04.30]Hold on.
[44:18.42]I don't know how to get underneath.
[44:19.64]Stand up so I can see you're under carriage here.
[44:22.47]Thank you.
[44:25.97]Okay, there's one part.
[44:41.76]Just draw pants.

[44:46.84]I need like gray.
[44:47.92]I'm covering him in underwear.
[44:49.02]I don't think you guys understand like that's fucking happening I don't care how long this takes It's gonna be a little darker Zoom in a little
[45:39.23]I need him to lie down for a second.
[45:47.43]There's a little hole for his tail.
[45:48.86]Let's get that done.
[46:10.66]Oh, scream!
[46:11.26]He's screaming!
[46:12.04]Whoa, he's a screamer!
[46:23.94]Can I get him to go the other way?
[46:31.50]No, you know, I'm not drawing... I'm not gonna draw, like, a dick, guys.
[46:35.00]Like, you think that's... That's not even funny, okay?

[50:47.56]The lines are wrong?
[50:49.18]What do you mean?
[50:49.60]No, they're not.
[50:55.12]He's like enjoying this.

[51:26.62]I'm going to dress him up in the perfect clothes.
[51:35.86]Alright, so now we just need Gray.
[51:37.23]Clean that up and he's good to go.
[51:38.81]Unless I'm going to do more, which I might.
[51:41.91]This is the fan favorite for me, guys.
[51:45.22]I don't know about you, but this is my fan favorite right here.
[51:57.60]There we go.
[52:03.00]Make that brush smaller.
[52:11.67]Smaller.
[52:26.91]Okay, that's close enough.
[52:31.37]There needs to be a black line under here, but the way that he moves around, I don't know if that's even going to be possible.
[52:39.48]Make a bra.
[52:40.34]Make a bra.
[52:40.76]I'm not going to put a bra on him.
[52:42.06]It's not going to work.
[52:45.69]No, that's going to take too much.
[52:46.85]Look at this.
[52:50.95]That's going to take... No, no way.
[52:54.03]You already have a diaper on.
[52:55.47]That's a pack of Hanes male underwear.
[52:57.93]In fact, you know what?
[52:59.63]Now we're gonna go the extra mile.
[53:16.93]Hold on, I gotta clean that up.

[55:53.16]Alright, he's good.
[55:54.90]Cat, uh, Catamine Creep is fine.
[55:57.60]I just joined and I already want to leave.
[56:02.87]Imagine opening the stream, waiting for it to load, potentially watching the preload ad.
[56:08.61]You know, oh, Call of Duty, Black Ops 4, coming soon, to theaters, and you're like, oh, whatever, what's this stream?
[56:14.62]And then instantly, the second after that ad...
[56:22.71]You'd be gone in a second.
[56:27.33]There's no shit on him, right?
[56:28.41]I didn't miss any shit stains?
[56:31.61]No, that looks good.
[56:32.49]Perfect.
[56:33.57]Now, I'm going to want to do this to all of them.
[56:40.86]I missed one?
[56:41.66]No, I didn't.
[56:43.08]Did I miss a shit mark?
[56:44.60]I better not have.
[56:50.03]No, he's good.
[56:50.49]He's clean.
[56:51.53]Alright, that's good.
[56:52.84]uh so now back all done let's move on to orson's fine let me make sure that's saved it did now they're all in comparison just actually no that's fine I don't he can be the only weirdo that's alright let's make another one let's make a this is make another dog done
[57:31.37]Mickey Mouse, let's go.
[57:33.33]Let's go!
[57:34.73]Come on, get punked!
[57:40.89]It's happening, we're making Mickey Mouse.
[57:42.69]What's happening right now?
[57:48.21]What is Mickey, I need to see his face.
[57:53.54]Imagine trying to punk people up that much.
[57:56.74]Okay, looks good.
[58:00.11]I know exactly what he... I have to make the whole thing.
[58:03.69]Okay, so this is... This is going to take a while.
[58:06.59]So, it's going to take the whole thing.
[58:09.09]The whole stream.
[58:09.75]The rest of the entire stream is going to be making Mickey Mouse.
[58:13.29]Welcome to the help you have fun.
[58:20.87]So, Mickey Mouse has... I need an image up there.
[58:24.55]Where is it?
[58:24.91]Where'd it go?
[58:27.42]There it is.
[58:30.48]So he's got the big ears, right?
[58:31.74]Yeah.
[58:36.00]He's going to be... This dog has to be all black.
[58:40.51]But we can figure that out later.
[58:42.09]He's got that little button nose.
[58:43.21]His eyes are in.
[58:48.27]The eyes are big.
[58:48.97]I'm going to move them in, though.
[58:53.79]Go to detail.
[58:54.29]Maybe I can put them in.
[59:05.69]He's got that little face, but his jowls are up.
[59:09.77]So it's actually like that.
[59:15.64]That's not Mickey Mouse.
[59:18.38]That's not even close.
[59:22.29]This is not even remotely close.
[59:24.03]I don't think I can make it.
[59:25.43]I can't do it.
[59:27.45]So I just have to make Scooby-Doo instead.
[59:30.03]Or, no.
[59:31.45]I'm committing.
[59:32.15]Don't give up that easily.
[59:33.19]Are you serious?
[59:36.26]I'm not going to give up that easily.
[59:38.94]Just take it step by step.
[59:39.82]There you go.
[59:59.14]Wider face.
[59:59.74]At least I have to come back up.
[60:01.66]How did I even do that?
[60:06.34]I don't even know how the fuck I grabbed these.
[60:07.98]There we go.
[60:15.51]Okay.
[60:17.51]So now we just gotta paint the face on him.
[60:20.21]Because the mouth... I can't really adjust the mouth that much.
[60:24.09]So that's gonna all be painting.
[60:26.81]The eyes can be painted over.
[60:32.01]Here's a creative character trick for you guys, if you don't know.
[60:34.45]If you don't, can't do eyes, close them shut and paint over them.
[60:49.86]Just a question of getting it in the right spot to be able to move it.
[60:54.50]Come on.
[60:56.06]Come on, give me the corners.
[60:58.88]No, I want the corners.
[61:00.48]Can I put a mask on him?
[61:04.69]That's better.
[61:12.55]There we go.
[61:14.49]Close enough.
[61:22.26]I wonder if I can pull the nose all the way in.
[61:25.48]Yep.
[61:25.96]Okay.
[61:27.88]Ears are fine.
[61:29.64]Head shape is fine.
[61:30.46]Actually, I might... Can I... I think I'm... Is there a...
[61:34.34]No, no.
[61:41.26]It's still Mickey Mouse.
[61:42.04]I don't fucking care.
[61:47.47]If you think that I'm going to let this stop me, you're out of your mind.
[62:05.85]Okay.
[62:10.47]Actually, this is actually better.
[62:13.29]You'll see why very shortly.
[62:17.48]This is actually the shape of Mickey Mouse's face.
[62:20.00]He has the weird lines.
[62:36.89]Okay.
[62:38.05]Looks good.
[62:38.58]Let's get to the paint work here.
[62:39.80]Actually, I'm going to move the eyes in.
[62:45.24]Detail.
[62:45.76]Pull these down.
[62:46.46]Okay.
[62:51.26]Alright, paint mode.
[62:52.40]Check it out.
[62:55.04]No, I have to make the dog.
[62:55.94]He's going to be all black.
[62:59.26]Exit that paint mode, buddy.
[63:02.74]Go back.
[63:06.78]Coat color.
[63:07.64]There it is.
[63:08.46]It's got to be this one.
[63:11.07]All of it has to be that.
[63:12.01]Okay, better.
[63:20.01]Paint mode initiate.
[63:20.92]Let's go.
[63:23.10]Get in there.
[63:23.60]Okay, so now Mickey Mouse has his whole face is this color here.
[63:28.00]It's going to be a hard line.
[63:35.48]Except for the sides of his I'll do it later Okay, hold on sure I get this right Yeah, just under the chin here We can clean it up later He's got this weird Widow's Peak thing going on, too
[64:03.84]he's got that this is already done here let's the nose let's make sure we get it right okay
[64:32.97]Hmm, he's got the he's got gloves these gloves And he's got he's got the yellow shoes it's stitch
[65:01.55]I wonder if I can draw like a smile.
[65:13.78]I gotta make his hands bigger too.
[65:16.98]Why am I doing, why am I taking this long?
[65:19.65]This stream's been, we've been playing, it's like an hour and a half.
[65:30.44]That's right.
[65:30.82]Sit.

[66:49.19]See, I'm making it quick.
[66:57.49]This is just somebody dressed up their dog as Mickey Mouse.
[67:00.61]It's not actually Mickey Mouse.
[67:02.75]It's just somebody made their dog Mickey Mouse for like a Halloween costume and it's fucked up.
[67:09.13]Alright, now I need the two buttons.

[77:08.10]No, I can't.
[77:09.46]I can't.
[77:11.11]I can't do it.

[80:13.39]I just made them to move into the neighborhood.
[80:15.23]I should have just bought a pre-made house.
[80:19.27]What the fuck?
[80:21.15]Can I just delete this?
[80:22.73]It's too late.
[80:30.56]this.
[80:32.16]No, these guys are going to be in our game world.
[80:34.20]That's the whole point.
[80:35.98]I want to go visit this house.
[80:37.22]Delete this.
[80:40.96]I'm going to evict them.
[80:43.12]They're getting evicted.
[80:44.14]I'm just going to buy a pre-made house.
[80:45.16]They're going to be neighbors.
[80:46.24]Delete this whole thing.
[80:55.53]Thanks for the money.
[80:57.03]Back out.
[80:57.79]Let's go.
[81:02.46]Back to the neighborhood.
[81:10.00]No, they don't have a house.
[81:11.72]Manage worlds.
[81:13.47]Just go manage worlds.
[81:21.93]Let's pull them out of here.
[81:23.30]So let's evict this family.
[81:27.14]Visit.
[81:27.96]Build.
[81:29.26]More.
[81:30.74]Move out of household.
[81:32.18]Where's the freak house?
[81:33.79]Right here.
[81:34.77]Guess who's moving in right next door.
[81:43.65]Remaining funds.
[81:44.25]1600.
[81:44.51]The creep household is moving.
[81:46.17]Could this be a perfect home?
[81:48.89]Furnished.
[81:51.09]Got it.
[81:53.91]Now we got neighbors.
[81:55.11]Let's do it.
[82:08.11]We're good to go.
[82:11.61]And look at the neighbors over here.
[82:13.69]I wonder what's happening in this household.
[82:16.49]You know who lives here.
[82:17.31]Wait, there's no dog shit in here, though.
[82:24.31]Can they sleep in my bed?
[82:28.54]What is he doing?
[82:28.92]Get off the table.
[82:29.36]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[82:30.44]Get off the table.
[82:32.80]What am I eating?
[82:34.64]Eat cheese crackers.
[82:37.90]Where are the other dogs?
[82:39.02]Don't lie in the street, get in here!
[82:40.30]Look, alright, I can control the dogs though.
[82:50.09]I can actually move the dogs.
[82:52.29]I got a mod that makes it so I can move them.
[82:56.35]What the fuck was that?
[83:02.93]Pet talk to Tootsie Poop.
[83:06.15]What the fuck is this dog's name?
[83:08.59]Oh, Tootsie Pop.
[83:10.09]I forgot his name.
[83:10.99]Alright, so let's see.
[83:18.48]Can the dogs get jobs?
[83:19.96]Where are they going?
[83:26.12]Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[83:26.72]Don't just run around.
[83:27.66]Stay in the house.
[83:32.86]I'm going to lose one of these dogs.
[83:34.81]Tell Jim Whipsy.
[83:38.58]Do extreme violence.
[83:40.25]I don't think I have any options to do anything like that.
[83:45.33]Okay, more choices.
[83:48.13]There is none.
[83:49.17]Disable reactions.
[83:50.13]Make partner.
[83:50.67]Enable autonomous killing.
[84:00.82]Not yet.
[84:01.26]Hold on.
[84:01.56]That's extreme.
[84:02.52]Hold on.
[84:03.56]We're not quite there yet.
[84:08.73]This guy's eating crackers out of a bowl for dinner.
[84:12.75]What about the dogs?
[84:13.51]Feed the dogs.
[84:14.37]Feed dog.
[84:18.78]Buy a vet clinic?
[84:22.90]No, everybody wants crackers.

[116:42.15]Okay, this will work.
[116:47.43]Alright.

[117:48.48]Is this the same guy?
[117:49.90]Okay, so I got it.
[117:55.93]Ziploc bag of cocaine contains a few lines.
[117:59.97]They're all sleeping.
[118:18.22]Can I, like, do the drugs with them?
[118:25.99]I don't know.
[118:26.61]What am I... Am I doing it?
[118:34.34]Open it and then go to the sink.
[118:39.06]Wait a minute.
[118:41.14]This is average... Average grade Colombian nose candy for your outgoing sim.
[118:45.67]Use with caution.
[118:46.37]Can be very addictive.
[118:48.46]Am I putting up my ass?
[118:50.03]What am I doing?
[118:50.57]Oh no, I'm just going to the bathroom.
[118:58.33]Oh no!

[120:35.01]Oh, that's too bad.
[120:37.86]I don't think you can.
[120:40.24]That's so unfortunate.
[120:43.80]Oh, I can just do it.
[121:05.87]Oh well.
[121:09.83]That's too bad.
[121:19.20]Select cat, make cat do lines.
[121:21.22]I can't.
[121:23.22]Doesn't work.
[121:25.60]That's so unfortunate.
[121:31.95]I say that like it's a bad thing.
[121:33.29]Well, I just can't believe I can't do drugs as a dog.
[121:41.01]Try to share the coke with the cat that you control and then share it.
[121:46.28]Yerima, please!
[121:48.80]Share cocaine with small head Elbertson.
[121:52.50]Nope.

[122:26.71]All these other animals have it on.
[122:30.02]That's already on drug.
[122:32.32]The drug dealer has the settings.
[122:33.50]Yeah, I have him turned on.
[122:38.33]What?
[122:40.55]Are you sure that they didn't already do it?
[122:42.11]The dealer's jacking me.
[122:50.02]He stole my coke?
[122:51.08]Kill him.

[125:10.62]So wait, will the cat pull a gun and start attacking people?
[125:17.26]I can't kill the dealer.
[125:18.22]There's no option for it.
[125:21.22]All I can do is this.
[125:24.23]Enable killing for me.
[125:29.59]I'm gonna die.
[125:32.95]I just want to see one time where the cat pulls out a fucking gun.
[125:39.44]And shoots me in the face.

[126:54.60]What's going on?
[127:03.27]Okay, I don't want to save this.
[127:04.57]I need to exit.
[127:05.65]Manage worlds.
[127:06.86]Don't save.
[127:09.48]He's taking out the trash.
[127:11.26]Alright, okay.
[127:18.72]Okay, we have... Let's just pretend that shit didn't happen.
[127:21.30]We're going to go back to manage the worlds.
[127:25.64]No saving.
[127:29.50]Oh my god.
[127:32.44]Nothing ever happened.
[127:34.62]We have... Who lives here?
[127:38.51]Nobody lives here.
[127:39.19]We're going to pick a family to move in.
[127:50.05]I need to go to my... I don't want to create.
[127:53.45]I already have a group.
[127:57.61]Where's my household?
[128:06.75]I mean, I didn't save the creeps.
[128:07.91]Yeah, I did.
[128:19.54]I had a save there.
[128:27.48]Wait, remember when I exited the first time?
[128:29.34]I went to library and scrolled down.
[128:43.66]I didn't make these people.
[128:50.99]What?
[128:58.51]Didn't I save that shit?
[129:00.89]Include custom content.
[129:05.87]Okay, here we go.
[129:08.09]What?
[129:11.53]Why is it only him and the dog?
[129:27.97]No, but when I went in there the first time... Hold on a minute.
[129:30.85]Exit.
[129:31.31]Exit.
[129:32.59]When I went into the game the first time, I saved it.
[129:36.88]And I said, don't save.
[129:37.80]I said, just continue.
[129:38.50]I didn't say save.
[129:42.78]Look, see?
[129:45.02]They're right here.
[129:47.18]I remember doing this.
[129:58.10]I saved it right before we did all that weird shit.
[130:04.22]Yeah, see?
[130:05.42]I knew I had it saved.
[130:08.86]Alright, so now let's just... We did the thing where we tried to get the animals to do drugs.
[130:16.67]So let's play.
[130:17.27]We're going to go back to what I was doing here.
[130:20.77]Because there's other shit that I added that I need to see how it works.
[130:25.64]What do you mean Sandler?
[130:26.92]No, he's not.
[130:27.74]He's not here.
[130:31.48]Save him to the gallery?
[130:40.74]Get them all married.
[130:42.74]Save them all to the gallery for precaution.
[130:45.38]Is there a way I can just do that?
[130:48.00]Easily.
[130:51.56]Upload them.
[130:52.22]I want them.
[130:57.87]Manage households, just right here.
[131:00.97]Move household.
[131:02.15]Move into other households.
[131:04.23]Edit ad or transfer or mark as unplayed.
[131:09.31]Just keep it private.
[131:11.06]Keep it private.
[131:12.22]Well, everyone wants to keep it private.
[131:18.38]Stream delay test?
[131:19.14]No, I can see it.
[131:21.90]Oh, but they're not here.
[131:22.56]That's weird.
[131:28.75]Just go to edit.
[131:29.35]Well, I'll do that later.
[131:30.37]They're not going to die.
[131:31.47]Don't worry.
[131:31.83]I want to play the game.
[131:34.11]I'm not going to upload them right now.
[131:35.29]We'll do it later.
[131:44.56]Do not release such horrors upon our world.
[131:46.44]Alright.
[131:48.00]So, not only did I include drugs into the game, I also included magic.
[131:53.12]I don't...
[131:55.82]And they're all still crying about Sam, though, that's fine.
[131:58.32]So, I added magical powers.
[132:06.27]But, I don't know... I don't know where... where those are.
[132:10.79]Because they're apparently in the game.
[132:19.97]Powers can kill people, okay.
[132:23.47]Demonic sopping!
[132:27.85]Tell a joke about, I thought this had Mondays.
[132:32.41]And then I saw, I thought, again, Twitch chat, imply mother is Ligma, right?
[132:42.76]You guys have ruined me.
[132:44.92]Actions, actions, actions.
[132:46.64]Where would it be?
[132:48.34]Mischief, funny, I don't know where it would be.
[132:50.76]It's not listed here.
[132:58.12]Declare weather preference.
[133:02.66]And that's the only... Yes, that's correct.
[133:05.86]That's the first time I've ever said that word.
[133:09.52]And I'm upset that I just did.
[133:12.61]God damn it.
[133:17.47]Options.
[133:18.47]Enable killing.
[133:19.31]No, I don't want to enable killing.
[133:21.01]Selfies.
[133:22.15]Check kill count.
[133:23.01]I don't have...
[133:26.96]He's late for work.
[133:28.08]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[133:28.76]What do you mean late for work?
[133:31.34]Stop punching a punching bag.
[133:32.48]Go to work.
[133:32.92]What are you, crazy?
[133:34.88]Go to work.
[133:37.17]Go to work.

[134:07.36]Okay, a lump of clay.
[134:15.77]No, is that for real?
[134:20.59]Investigate mold clay.
[134:23.03]No, he's at work.
[134:23.75]No, stay at work.
[134:24.57]Don't do that.
[134:26.54]Did he just come back?
[134:27.34]God damn it.
[134:29.82]What, you want me to mold the clay?
[134:31.24]Oh, of course I want to mold that clay.
[134:33.40]Go to work.
[134:34.96]It is over.
[134:41.23]I think I got fired.
[134:47.15]No, I'm just... I'm just not... What is he doing with this?
[134:56.20]Fucking crying.
[134:58.12]That's actually... Okay, nice.
[135:06.25]I'm not sure this other mod is working.
[135:08.71]The...
[135:11.46]Magic mod.
[135:12.12]Unless I'm missing something here.
[135:15.38]The drug one works.

[136:02.59]Scripts are enabled.
[136:04.15]Investigate it.

[136:13.00]That's what you really do?
[136:16.02]What?
[136:18.44]I can't believe that's what you actually do.

[142:07.37]No.
[142:07.77]Stop trying to go on the computer.
[142:09.21]Go to bed.
[142:25.63]Yes, turning into Peter Pan now.
[142:28.99]I can't wait to do like a love fun magic spell and then somebody comes up and fucking stabs me.
[142:37.32]So, should we go Magical Connection?
[142:44.21]Being tapped to the power of Llamadeus affords one potent magical strength, but Llamadeus requires an ongoing tribute of sacrificing or draining needs to maintain the connection.
[142:52.90]Okay.
[142:58.02]I almost didn't recognize this guy when he came in.
[143:05.78]Although I'm... Alignment?
[143:08.87]Sorcerers are affected by performing certain types of spells, shifting them toward the light or the dark.
[143:15.86]I better the world with white magic.
[143:17.58]Sacrifice in need to another Sim.
[143:19.52]Use cathartic healing on another Sim when both are sad.
[143:22.26]Or instantly dry out puddles to continue your exploration.
[143:26.80]Alright, I'm going to make you not sad.
[143:29.88]Come here.
[143:30.48]Let's make Mr. Potato Head not sad.
[143:32.34]Not sad?
[143:45.00]Insult his face.
[143:48.82]Insult his face.
[143:52.19]Insult his face.
[143:53.23]Where did it go?
[144:11.11]Okay.
[144:12.15]White Arts.
[144:14.09]Let's give him some healing.
[144:15.96]Give him healing.
[144:23.30]Did it work?
[144:33.37]Now let's discuss the latest video game.
[144:35.11]This guy's going to be like a level 3 wizard in a second here.
[144:38.29]I got more black magic abilities.
[144:39.81]Let's try...
[144:41.19]I would have left with him first.
[144:43.97]He's been awake for 24 hours.
[144:49.54]He's still awake.
[144:50.90]He doesn't need, he's a black magic magician.
[144:53.32]He doesn't need to sleep.
[144:58.92]And then we're gonna make Potato Head kneel.
[145:03.52]Should I... What's my energy like?
[145:09.08]I'm hungry.
[145:09.90]Go make some food, please.
[145:12.42]Wait, how old is this?
[145:13.56]How old is this?
[145:16.04]Excellent.
[145:16.44]Mac and cheese.
[145:17.36]Grab a serving.
[145:18.26]Go get it.
[145:22.61]Bring back Adam Sandler.
[145:23.79]I might be able to.
[145:24.35]I might be able to resurrect him.
[145:30.87]Level 3.
[145:33.04]He can now cast Suppressed Sadness on himself.
[145:39.84]Apparently I'm angry.
[145:40.68]Alright, so he's level 3.
[145:42.22]Alright, that's enough.
[145:44.09]What's it say?
[145:45.11]Teleport.
[145:47.39]What?
[145:47.91]Teleport.
[145:50.63]Black Arts.
[145:51.53]Set.
[146:05.63]Where did it go?
[146:09.19]It's not there anymore.
[146:38.19]What?
[146:43.79]So... I can light the table on fire.
[146:49.93]I'm sleeping at the table!
[146:51.01]Not when I'm asleep!
[146:51.83]Wait till I wake up!
[146:53.72]I was just snoring at the table!
[147:02.30]He's scared.
[147:03.48]Not only should it actually work, it worked!
[147:07.00]Oh my god!
[147:09.08]I'm sorry!
[147:09.82]I'll never practice black magic again, Snape!
[147:13.85]They're all running out of the house.
[147:16.99]The house is not on fire.
[147:38.04]Hey, I leveled up!
[147:39.04]I made somebody... Winter?
[147:41.42]It's Christmas.
[147:42.22]Merry Christmas.
[147:45.22]Uh, they're still eating, though.
[147:47.24]Yeah, that's alright.

[169:49.56]Somebody on fire?
[169:54.46]Oh, here's death.
[170:00.26]Oh, the table's on fire.
[170:05.16]I guess it doesn't matter how many times you kill Santa.
[170:07.78]Hold on.
[170:08.12]Wait, I have a... This is going to be fucking crazy.
[170:09.78]Hold on.
[170:10.36]Everybody's going to kill him.
[170:12.08]With a different thing.
[170:30.96]They're all just waiting for him to open.
[170:33.01]Everyone's just waiting for him to be alive again.
[170:38.25]What is that sound?
[170:39.77]What?
[170:44.57]Okay, that's it.
[170:45.37]That's it, I'm done.
[170:46.79]Wait, what am I doing?
[170:50.37]Santa can go home now.
[171:01.00]I'm pointing the guns out.
[171:02.06]Alright, let's do drugs with Santa.
[171:06.92]Oh, I don't have any.
[171:08.08]Make them all shoot him?
[171:12.55]Oh my God.
[171:14.05]He's going to bed.
[171:15.45]Oh.
[171:31.25]She's in jail.
[171:32.03]She went to jail.
[171:35.69]Is she in jail?
[171:42.39]She's going back to sleep.
[171:44.11]He knows that's a way for him to get away with it.
[171:50.20]Kill the cop?
[171:50.84]I don't know where he is.
[171:58.24]The house is still on fire.
[172:05.38]Now he's running away.
[172:06.22]He said to take a nap real quick.
[172:09.36]No, he got the cookies.
[172:10.08]He's like, I got the cookies, motherfucker.
[172:11.40]I'm out of here.
[172:13.35]I got the cookies.
[172:13.91]That's what I came for.
[172:15.27]You can't kill me.
[172:16.07]These are good.
[172:19.97]These taste pretty yummy.
[172:23.54]These are 10 out of 10 cookies.
[172:25.83]Yeah, that guy's got big muscles, too.
[172:29.67]It's beautiful.
[172:36.39]He's crying.
[172:41.24]Look at his face.
[172:41.82]His face is so fucked up.
[172:46.96]These are really good.
[172:48.48]I would give these cookies maybe like a 4 out of 10.
[172:50.76]A little too much baking soda, in my opinion.
[172:56.81]I don't know what you use for these, but holy shit.
[173:01.41]You put it inside the oven for a little too long.
[173:05.33]Something about the taste is off.
[173:12.78]He's sick of waiting for him to do it.
[173:16.43]You know, I've had a lot of cookies in my life, but those were a solid four, I'll tell you.
[173:21.69]Bunga.
[173:39.59]Don't go out there, Santa!
[173:42.20]Speaking of a book... Where are you going with the book?
[173:48.92]Death is washing the dishes.
[173:50.98]I just want to make sure we're very clear about this.
[174:00.16]Oh my god.
[174:03.16]At what point does the house just burn to the ground?
[174:09.50]Where is everybody?
[174:11.70]In bed.
[174:16.44]It's Adam Sandler.
[174:17.89]Wait, what?
[174:18.87]What is he doing?
[174:33.67]Oh, no.
[174:52.87]Don't put it out!
[174:55.79]Don't put the fire up!
[174:58.03]Don't put out the fire!
[175:06.05]Why does he have an umbrella?
[175:07.75]It's a fire right now.
[175:08.93]Why do you have an umbrella?
[175:09.97]What's with the umbrellas?
[175:11.73]Adam Sandler is still here as a ghost.
[175:13.99]Get rid of him.
[175:15.85]Get rid of him, even as a ghost.
[175:18.61]Kill him.
[175:19.78]He doesn't belong here right now.
[175:21.12]He stabbed somebody.
[175:22.24]He killed somebody.
[175:23.04]Who did he kill?
[175:24.48]Shoot him.
[175:28.18]There's another death here.
[175:29.18]Death is on the computer.
[175:32.12]Death is on the fucking computer trolling the internet.
[175:41.12]Alright, somebody else is gonna have to do it.
[175:42.16]Where's he going?
[175:46.91]He's going... Don't go to, like, haunt me.
[175:48.87]Not me.
[175:50.53]He wants to go on the computer?
[175:52.41]What are you doing?
[176:01.80]Alright, I have to put a fucking stop to this shit.
[176:06.02]I gotta put a stop to this.
[176:20.38]He's alive again.
[176:21.67]Are you kidding me?
[176:26.45]We had to do something.
[176:27.59]We had to do something.
[176:28.43]He was unstoppable.
[176:29.67]I checked the police reports on the internet.
[176:37.36]Oh, somebody's dead.
[176:38.88]Somebody burned... Hold on, I can banish Sandler.
[176:50.69]Banish him.
[176:52.45]Black Arts, boss, Black Arts.
[176:55.59]No, how do I banish him?
[176:57.90]No, don't shoot photos with him.

[177:39.40]Why is he killing people?
[177:46.08]Is Santa still here?
[177:49.12]Where's Santa Claus?
[177:53.04]But we lost another person in the house.
[177:55.28]Whoa!

[178:02.44]Someone else is dead.
[178:04.02]No, no, no!
[178:04.64]Wait!
[178:05.08]Why am I being arrested?
[178:21.10]No, no, no.
[178:21.32]Don't let him take us all.
[178:23.86]Take care of him now.
[178:27.17]He has to be taken.
[178:27.67]Take care of him.
[178:28.19]Take care of him.
[178:34.21]Go take care of him.

[178:48.80]Okay, good.
[178:51.90]He's dead.

[179:00.69]Dude, when fucking... When Adam Sandler killed Death... And then when Death... When Death... I have a bad headache right now.
[179:13.24]What does he have to do with this?
[179:14.26]Is he dead in the bathtub?
[179:15.18]What?
[179:18.23]Ugh.
[179:18.67]He sat down to use the computer and then Adam Sandler stabbed him in the chest.
[179:30.77]Un-fucking-believable, man.
[179:32.78]Ugh.
[179:36.20]I gotta take a piss.

[179:37.60]I'll be right back.
[179:42.86]See you in like two minutes.
[182:29.62]god the funniest thing about this whole thing honestly is Sandler comes back on Christmas night midnight on Christmas and the person he kills is the only guy to go mourn him at his grave that's the person why did you kill him
[182:52.39]There was no reason for that.
[182:53.55]Like, that's the only guy that gave the respect that, you know what I mean?
[182:56.15]He gave him the respect.
[182:57.79]And he comes in on Christmas and just starts killing him.
[183:02.76]He killed Frufu.
[183:03.88]Frufu is gone.
[183:12.44]My lord.
[183:16.15]And now I've got, I've got like a monster migraine right now.
[183:20.59]Holy shit.
[183:26.70]I gotta give a quick shout out to these mods because holy shit, they've made this game so fucking ridiculous.

[246:03.33]I can't do this shit anymore, man.
[246:05.45]Why is this lady still walking around?
[246:07.15]You were supposed to stab this person.
[246:18.87]Good boy.
[246:21.43]That's the reins of Castamere, by the way.

[246:41.68]I'm sick of foos, aren't you?
[246:45.40]Fanoi!
[246:48.19]I think it's funny, apparently.
[246:51.45]Just eating chips over here.
[246:55.87]I'm not eating soup, those are potato chips.
[247:06.42]I've been high for like four days.
[247:09.18]What do you have to think, man?
[247:09.94]What do you have to say about this shit?
[247:12.08]What a wild night, don't you think?

[247:58.17]Is that guy mopping up bodies?
[248:04.43]He's back.
[248:19.90]This lady is mopping up dead bodies.
[248:28.40]Get this lady off karaoke.
[248:34.22]Me and Death are gonna do karaoke.
[248:41.65]Wait, he's dead.
[248:45.45]How is this gonna work?
[248:47.68]Am I about to dedicate my song to him?
[248:49.52]He's dead.
[248:51.06]I'm waiting for him to come up here.
[248:59.19]I'm waiting for him to come over here.
[249:00.51]What are you thinking?
[249:01.17]Let's wait for death to not be busy.
[249:18.53]Death has to take these three people.
[249:24.22]He's so fucked up on drugs he doesn't even know.
[249:37.07]Come on!
[249:39.21]Death, hurry up!
[249:42.67]No, wait!
[249:44.14]No, don't.
[249:45.78]Wait, my talon.
[249:47.90]Don't do it.
[249:50.70]No, wait.
[249:54.21]Wait, somebody else do it.
[249:59.45]Get over there, Garrett.
[250:00.31]It's up to you.
[250:02.85]Come on, Garrett.
[250:04.55]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[250:06.07]Don't do it.

[250:09.42]No.
[250:09.92]Please.
[250:10.08]Please.
[250:14.61]What about Garrett?
[250:17.55]Garrett?
[250:18.85]No.
[250:18.93]What?
[250:19.11]That guy just had a heart attack.
[251:00.29]Curse the stream.
[251:05.69]Can I sing a duet with death yet?
[251:09.27]That's how this has to end.
[251:11.59]Now he has to come clean up this fucking guy.
[251:13.21]Like I had Fox die in his body.
[251:21.67]Hey, by the way, Alien made $306 today
[251:53.23]No, never mind.
[251:56.43]Big money!
[251:59.26]Oh yeah, right.
[252:01.34]Okay, take him and then please let us finish up at the wedding.
[252:04.54]Are people pissing everywhere?
[252:07.77]Nobody plead for him.
[252:11.49]No.
[252:11.83]Just eat the chips.
[252:12.91]Thank you for coming to the wedding.
[252:14.75]Take one of the gift baskets if you haven't gotten one yet.
[252:19.53]On your way out.
[252:21.19]The parking lot's a little weird, so be careful.
[252:23.03]There's a right-hand turn that comes up on you real quick.
[252:26.41]And it's dark out there, so...
[252:29.79]Okay, are you busy?
[252:31.08]He's not busy now, alright.
[252:33.10]Oh, come on, who else is dead?
[253:04.30]This can't be fucking real.
[253:07.40]Freezing to death.
[253:33.62]Not a drip!
[253:35.86]Spritch!
[254:04.84]This guy's still dancing.
[254:06.82]He's like... He's freezing to death.
[254:17.67]Why is he the only one freezing to death?
[254:21.77]Does anybody understand why that is?
[254:24.91]Look at this lady.
[254:25.45]This lady has no... Just look at this lady's bare shoulders, bare arms.
[254:31.17]Okay, the time to go.
[254:33.69]Make a fire?
[254:34.51]Okay, that's right.
[254:40.51]You don't have enough magical connection.
[254:42.11]What?
[254:44.72]Drain somebody.
[254:47.98]Drain the bartender.
[254:48.64]Who cares?
[254:59.73]Quick, quick, go!
[255:00.31]Drain hygiene!
[255:02.75]Drain this lady.
[255:05.61]Did I get it?
[255:13.93]Okay, I feel good.
[255:16.49]Okay, we're good?
[255:20.75]I need to start a fire.
[255:25.99]There we go.
[255:26.39]Warm up.
[255:27.31]Everybody warm up.
[255:27.89]It's going to be okay.
[255:31.63]Alright, we're good?
[255:33.73]Do it.
[255:34.05]Alright, now stand over by the fire.
[255:36.59]I know it's really cold and you're tired, but come on, just stand next to the fire.
[255:56.68]I thought that was the guy that was still... Never mind.
[256:03.41]He's too sad to do it.
[256:04.79]Burn it.
[256:06.75]Burn the table.
[256:07.97]Go.
[256:13.05]Is he too cold?
[256:13.81]I think he might be too cold to do it.
[256:18.31]Date that guy.
[256:19.15]He's good.
[256:19.57]See the fire in his hands?
[256:22.77]He's good.
[256:27.74]I guess not.
[256:28.20]He's gone.
[256:28.76]Okay, well, whatever.
[256:30.00]Bye.
[256:30.24]He's gone.
[256:57.14]Can we leave?
[256:58.62]Can we get out of here?
[256:59.50]Alright, Daffy, let's go.
[257:03.18]How much money do you have?
[257:04.30]You took a grave in the snow.
[257:08.62]Are you fucking serious?
[257:12.13]Okay, we need to go downstairs.
[257:13.41]Now.
[257:15.21]Downstairs.
[257:15.79]Go downstairs.
[257:16.35]Is somebody talking about if your car lights are on?
[257:22.17]Oh, no, this lady's about to sing.
[257:23.51]No, she's a comedian.
[257:24.41]Uh...
[257:51.16]That was bad enough to make her cry.
[257:52.86]Okay, I have to get out of here.
[258:09.33]We need to go downstairs now and end the wedding.
[258:12.78]Go.
[258:13.52]Everybody.
[258:15.68]Go downstairs.
[258:16.68]The whole thing didn't get officiated fast enough.
[258:21.86]I can't do a duet with death.
[258:23.24]He's busy.
[258:26.14]Marry death?
[258:26.84]I can't.
[258:33.03]It's an infinite wedding.
[258:36.37]You're not, like, dying, are you?
[258:37.89]Oh, fuck.
[258:38.19]I think he's dying, too.
[258:39.93]Nope.
[258:40.17]He's shoveling snow.
[258:42.11]Go downstairs.
[258:45.00]This is until 2 a.m.
[258:47.74]He's almost done.
[258:53.00]Jane has been brought back to life.
[258:54.58]Jeremy's in passion pleased to the Grim Reaper.
[258:56.64]I didn't do that.
[259:00.99]You can romance death.
[259:03.69]Well, I ran out of time here.
[259:04.69]The wedding is over.
[259:12.13]Night in the Town!
[259:12.85]Night in the Town was awesome!
[259:14.58]Jeremy had a wonderful time and got to do everything he planned to do.
[259:18.80]Cool, alright.
[259:20.66]They all did.
[259:21.44]We all got to do the things we wanted to do.
[259:32.03]Let's get out.
[259:34.63]Why is Tootsie Pop the dog still on here?
[259:52.14]You go to the gym?
[259:55.52]The market?
[259:56.19]This is kind of weird.
[259:57.91]But anyways.
[259:59.67]We're going to stop there tonight.
[260:02.53]I need a break again.
[260:04.21]It's just too much.
[260:05.87]There's so much overstimulation in this game that I feel like I've been laughing for like 45 minutes.
[260:12.26]Straight.
[260:13.30]Like add up the times that I've actually hurt myself laughing in the last two streams.
[260:16.90]It's been probably 45 straight minutes.
[260:22.11]So let's talk about this real quick.
[260:25.44]So next week, there'll be a stream on Monday and probably Tuesday, if I can.
[260:35.63]But I am not gonna be here for about seven or eight days.
[260:39.77]A full week is gonna go by.
[260:41.41]I'm going to Vegas.
[260:42.79]This is the trip that is the sign the papers, get everything ready to go.
[260:47.19]This is the first trip of the move portion of my life here, right?
[260:53.07]So after Tuesday,
[260:55.99]You are not going to see me in this.
[260:58.91]I'm not going to be able to play any games or you're not going to see me sitting down here for at least six or seven days.
[261:05.61]But I'm going to try to do a stream over the week where I just kind of sit in bed just to hang out and catch up and tell everybody how things are going.
[261:16.04]You know what I mean?
[261:17.62]So there'll be at least like one or two streams, probably one.
[261:20.36]It's going to be really hectic out there.
[261:23.06]So I'll try to do something out there.
[261:26.53]But that's the first trip.
[261:28.09]The second trip is obviously to move across the country, which will be a little longer.
[261:33.17]But I'll still try to do a couple streams over the course of that week too.
[261:36.51]But I'll be back after Tuesday.
[261:40.09]I'll be back September 7th.
[261:44.57]So streams will go back to normal for a couple of weeks.
[261:49.17]And then somewhere in the end of September into October is when I'm going to be moving.
[261:57.12]So, but for the sake of tonight, thanks for hanging out tonight.
[262:00.56]I will see you.
[262:00.98]Have a great weekend, everybody.
[262:03.26]I will see you guys on Monday.
[262:06.82]Have a fun weekend.
[262:08.24]Relax.
[262:09.04]Have a good time.
[262:10.86]The usual.
[262:12.22]And we're going to do the credits.
[262:14.40]So I'll see you guys on Monday.
[262:15.52]If you're sticking around, then cool.
[262:19.00]If not, then see you soon.
[262:20.50]Thanks for watching.
[262:21.46]It was a lot of fun.
[262:23.82]Sims 4 and all these crazy mods makes the game
[262:28.43]I don't think I could ever play The Sims normally again.
[262:30.68]This was too much fun.
[262:34.72]Am I done with The Sims?
[262:36.92]Yeah, probably.
[262:37.92]Probably for at least a little while.
[262:40.08]If I can get some of the other things I want to work to work, then we'll go back to it.
[262:46.22]What's the mod?
[262:47.12]I will actually... Let me go to the Discord.

[267:18.52]I just said it.
[267:18.94]Let's get that on there.

[267:43.41]Thank you.
[267:43.83]Niall Arion for the $1.
[267:45.17]It's my birthday, so I thought I'd give you a dollar to celebrate.
[267:47.27]Happy birthday.
[267:48.99]Happy birthday, Niall Arion.
[267:52.19]Have a good birthday.
[267:53.35]Have a good birthday, Beater.
[267:56.09]Thank you.
[267:57.43]Flank Tank, thanks for the $1.
[267:58.57]Here is hoping you remember to at least try near automata.
[268:02.39]Near automata once you get to Vegas.
[268:04.79]Good luck with the move.
[268:07.08]Yeah, there's a lot of... We still have all the Dreamcast shit to do.
[268:09.80]There's still PlayStation 2 stuff.
[268:12.04]Just haven't had a chance to really sit down and do it.
[268:15.42]But don't worry.
[268:15.90]We'll do all kinds of stuff.
[268:18.86]Thank you, Flank Tank.
[268:19.55]Thank you again to Hands Beats for the $1.
[268:22.57]No music stream.
[268:24.69]No, The Sims was just too... I had to give this another night.
[268:28.89]It was just too much fun.
[268:31.11]We'll do that when I get to Vegas.
[268:32.31]Don't worry.
[268:33.81]Well, not when I get to Vegas.
[268:34.65]When I get back from Vegas.
[268:36.68]But thank you, Handspeeds.
[268:37.59]Thank you, Corvid Moon, for the $1.
[268:38.61]I hope this joke hasn't worn out.
[268:40.11]It's welcome.
[268:42.15]What joke?
[268:44.39]I hope this joke hasn't worn out.
[268:45.93]It's welcome.
[268:51.71]Oh, it's a bee joke.
[268:54.18]The name's Bee Jerma Bee, is this one.
[268:56.10]Let's put it up.
[269:09.40]Throw it on there.
[269:10.14]So I think the thing about eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[269:19.95]Oh, shit.
[269:20.35]Hold on.
[269:21.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[269:23.15]Hold on.
[269:24.11]OK.
[269:24.43]Wait till he lands.
[269:24.95]Wait till he lands.
[269:25.75]Sneaky B. OK, he landed.
[269:42.16]That's the last one I'm gonna click on.
[269:44.18]That's where the joke ends.
[269:47.52]There will be no more of those on screen.
[269:58.41]If you guys are just gonna stop gnoming me on these things, then what, am I gonna click it and just get gnomed every time?
[270:06.47]No, I'm just kidding.
[270:07.03]Thank you, Corbin Moon, for your gnome bee video.
[270:13.11]Huge girl.
[270:13.95]Thanks for the two bucks.
[270:14.68]I hope wasp memes aren't out of fashion yet.
[270:16.68]I can't post links, but here's another one.
[270:20.02]Right when I said I had to.
[270:26.61]Why can I not grab this?
[270:31.77]No, it's because I can't click this link and I can't copy and paste it because Streamlabs
[270:36.48]For some stupid, dumb reason, I cannot copy and paste things in here.
[270:44.83]So it's not a link.
[270:46.61]You said it can't post links.
[270:49.87]But yeah, Streamlabs does this really funny thing where if you're in your recent events, your dashboard, and you try to select anything, it just... I think I might have just got it.
[271:02.12]Hold on.
[271:06.96]Let's see.
[271:07.44]YouTube.
[271:07.94]I have to replace this.
[271:10.98]Did it work?
[271:13.20]I don't think it did.
[271:19.56]Okay.
[271:19.80]I got the whole thing.
[271:21.58]What a pain in the ass.
[271:26.43]Streamlabs.
[271:27.21]Why the fuck do you do this shit?
[271:30.31]Don't ask me.
[271:31.19]But let's see if I can get it to work.
[271:34.15]And...
[271:36.83]Okay, I got it.
[271:38.41]I think.
[271:40.31]I think this is the thing.
[271:41.53]Let me see.
[271:42.01]Make sure.
[271:44.75]The command still exists?
[271:45.67]Which command?
[271:47.49]The command still exists?
[271:56.30]Hold on.
[271:58.18]Okay, let's watch it.
[272:05.33]I'm not going to be eating tonight.
[272:08.77]Yes, I will.
[272:09.27]Don't worry.
[272:12.51]So I think the thing about... I think eating... Going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[272:18.93]Oh, shit.
[272:19.21]Hold on.
[272:19.52]Wait, wait, wait.
[272:19.82]Hold on.
[272:22.14]Wait till he lands.
[272:22.66]Wait till he lands.
[272:23.68]This isn't Noam, I swear to God.
[272:31.50]Zap.
[272:34.41]That's pretty good.
[272:50.44]That's pretty good.
[272:51.38]That was good.
[272:53.92]Thank you huge girl Corvid moon is apologizing here for $1.
[272:59.92]I'd like to apologize for my haha video
[273:04.25]Apology accepted.
[273:05.99]Thank you, though.
[273:08.15]Wheatley the Snowy Owl, thanks for the $5.
[273:09.90]Your mutant sim beasts have made transitioning into college a life a lot easier for me.
[273:13.80]Thank you.
[273:15.96]I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
[273:17.66]I've been having a blast, too.
[273:19.58]So, thank you for the $5, Wheatley, and hope you do well in your move into college.
[273:26.97]Kilco, thanks for the $1.
[273:28.25]I still haven't started actually making the Fireman song because I don't know what genre to make it.
[273:32.99]Any suggestions?
[273:34.68]Also, I don't know if you skipped over this on purpose, so don't kill me.
[273:38.58]What?
[273:39.56]I didn't skip over anything.
[273:42.62]I... What genre would make the Fireman song?
[273:47.34]It's gotta be heavy metal, man.
[273:49.55]Heavy metal.
[273:53.73]Intense heavy metal.
[273:56.41]A campfire song?
[273:57.27]That's actually not bad either.
[274:02.65]Campfire heavy metal.
[274:03.57]There you go.
[274:04.09]There's your genre.
[274:06.07]Just that guy.
[274:06.69]Thanks for the two bucks.
[274:07.37]Oh, hey, Jerma.
[274:07.93]How are you?
[274:08.95]Adieu.
[274:10.17]Oh, here, dear God.
[274:11.19]What the fuck is that?
[274:15.03]Thank you for the $12, just that guy.
[274:18.49]I think the bread person may have been on screen.
[274:21.09]Thank you so much for your $12, dude.
[274:24.44]Sprint snail.
[274:25.04]Thanks for the $1.
[274:26.08]I'm a human just like you.
[274:26.98]I like to watch games and you're my favorite gamer.
[274:28.78]When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
[274:31.06]My question for you is, I am a good kid and I like to play and I like to go to school, but sometimes I get sad.
[274:36.61]What do you do when you get sad?
[274:37.97]How do you not be sad?
[274:45.41]I don't know.
[274:46.39]It's a hard question to answer.
[274:50.31]Because what makes me feel better does not necessarily make you feel better.
[274:57.64]You have to just find the things that you know can make you feel better.
[275:02.08]Because somebody might tell you, oh, hey, you got to do this.
[275:04.02]You got to do that.
[275:04.56]And you got to do that.
[275:05.06]And you'll feel great the next day.
[275:06.18]And you'll be like, I did that and it didn't help.
[275:07.70]That didn't do anything.
[275:10.50]So unfortunately, it's a very personal thing where you have to find the thing that can help you.
[275:16.43]It's not the same for everybody.
[275:24.71]Watch Brojack Horseman.
[275:26.79]That's a Brojack, part of the Brojack Horseman script.
[275:33.93]Is that, is it?
[275:34.57]No.
[275:38.76]Well, thank you, Sprint Snail.
[275:41.84]Thanks for the $1.
[275:43.10]Thank you, Roos Roos, for the $1.
[275:44.50]The Jerma, you've inspired me to make a career in comedy.
[275:46.44]It's already going quite well, actually.
[275:48.56]Just yesterday, I made someone laugh so much, they rolled into, here's a B, uh,
[276:08.72]Ooh, up in smoke!
[276:41.60]Thank you, Roos Roos.
[276:44.52]What was up with that next thing?
[276:45.80]I have no idea what the next thing was.
[276:47.59]It gives me random shit every time.
[276:50.03]Thank you, Roos Roos, for your bee video.
[276:53.53]This is why all bee videos now have to be banned.
[276:57.37]They're banned after this stream.
[277:01.62]Because we're getting over the whole look it's a bee and hey, now I'm going to put movie clips together.
[277:09.26]And then what happens after that?
[277:10.52]How far do we go?
[277:17.23]censorship.
[277:19.86]As far as we have to.
[277:24.00]They're getting better.
[277:24.76]Okay, look.
[277:25.82]This can be revived after I do the 1 hour and 45 minute green screen acting routine.
[277:35.84]You can use it again if you want.
[277:40.23]If you have no idea what I'm talking about, at some point next week, I'm putting up a green screen back here.
[277:45.50]And just going to act out random scenarios and then just let the community do whatever the fuck they want.
[277:50.76]And see what they do.
[278:00.78]New material.
[278:01.54]Yeah, it's coming up.
[278:03.26]That can go so wrong so fast.
[278:05.76]Whatever.
[278:08.82]We're gonna have rules in place, obviously.
[278:11.16]There'll be a screening process.
[278:18.54]But, yeah.
[278:23.66]No rules?
[278:24.48]No, what do you mean no rules?
[278:25.62]I can't have no rules.
[278:26.75]Can you imagine the fucking crazy shit, awful shit that people would put me in and make me do if I had, like... No, there's gotta be rules, guys.
[278:40.06]What am I drinking?
[278:41.18]I had... I had a down-east cider.
[278:44.22]I had two down-east ciders tonight.
[278:47.98]They're very good.
[278:55.22]Some good cider.
[278:55.88]Yeah.
[278:59.06]Blah.
[278:59.44]What?
[278:59.58]What are you talking about?
[279:01.88]I mean, it's been... I haven't... Let's see.
[279:05.00]What is it?
[279:05.48]I opened the first one like six hours ago.
[279:08.16]I've just been sipping on them.
[279:09.94]Say the line.
[279:14.83]What line?
[279:17.76]They're too sweet.
[279:18.96]These ones are, these are great.
[279:19.80]These actually aren't sweet at all.
[279:21.52]They're just sweet enough.
[279:27.72]Coffee?
[279:28.46]Oh, no.
[279:36.28]Prime Vino, thanks for the $2.
[279:40.10]Gasu Coin Shinpo Lit.
[279:45.09]What's that mean?
[279:48.25]I have no idea what you just said.
[279:52.95]But thank you.
[279:55.27]Thank you also to StixRenegade for the $1.
[279:59.45]Make my fursona.
[280:02.61]When I get back from Vegas, remind me.
[280:04.45]Remind me again when I get back from Vegas.
[280:07.51]Hey, free iPod.
[280:08.34]Thanks for $1.
[280:09.52]Please upload everything you've made to the gallery because I need the ketamine creep in my game.
[280:16.87]Academy creep.
[280:22.63]Make it in The Sims 4.
[280:23.34]Stay away from roulette.
[280:26.70]I'm not gonna play roulette, don't worry.
[280:30.22]Aggression cow, thanks for the one dollar.
[280:33.04]Uh, you didn't actually, I'm wrong, but thank you.
[280:35.15]Thank you Joe Razor for the one dollar.
[280:36.69]Hey, Jeremy, hear me out.
[280:38.97]Despite all the memes, Minecraft is actually a very good game and works especially well if you use a mod pack.
[280:44.18]I think if you can have fun with a game like House Flipper, then you can definitely also have fun with Minecraft.
[280:50.92]Plus, there is the added benefit of killing the meme.
[280:55.45]Joe, I appreciate the $1 and the comment here, but do you honestly think that if I played Minecraft on stream, that that would get rid of it?
[281:06.41]Or do you think that that would be pouring gasoline?
[281:12.90]Four or five cans of it.
[281:16.15]I think it would be gasoline.
[281:21.29]We will stop.
[281:23.15]Fight fire with fire?
[281:27.03]Yeah, like four of you guys said you'll stop.
[281:29.69]What about the other like 10,000 people?
[281:31.93]There's only one way to find out.
[281:39.44]I'll stop.
[281:40.00]I'll stop.
[281:41.20]Hey, I'll stop.
[281:43.14]Me?
[281:43.60]I'll stop.
[281:45.51]oh that's so dumb I love it but thank you Joe thank you John Cena for life for the five dollars hey there Jeremy I love your content just want to throw a couple of bits your way by the way could you do me a huge favor and say happy birthday to lacy yeah happy birthday lacy hope you have a good one and your friend John Cena for life uh made that a reality so thank you to John Cena for life for the five dollars and thank you to lacy hap no happy birthday lacy
[282:15.45]I've accepted at this point that I'm not going to be able to get food.
[282:18.21]So.
[282:19.14]It's been accepted.
[282:19.78]Don't worry.
[282:22.28]I was going to try to get it delivered anyways.
[282:25.22]Did they still deliver?
[282:25.84]Hold on.
[282:38.00]I got food in the fridge.
[282:38.80]It's alright.
[282:39.42]It's fine.
[282:43.22]My plan was to get it delivered.
[282:46.04]They close at 12?
[282:48.40]12.30?
[282:52.70]Nah, it's like 11.30.
[282:54.56]I'd be like that asshole that calls up at like 11.40, 11.40, 11.45.
[282:57.30]Hey, yeah, I know you close in like 15 fucking minutes, but can I get this?
[283:03.80]Can I get that?
[283:04.24]Can I get this?
[283:04.64]Can I get that?
[283:05.10]Can I get that?
[283:05.62]And can I get it delivered?
[283:06.64]It's like, oh, you fucking prick.
[283:23.17]Twitch on PS4, remove clips, what?
[283:27.66]I'll deliver it for you, will you?
[283:29.34]Thanks man.
[283:30.82]Tip well, I do tip well.
[283:42.69]They close at midnight means they leave at midnight, they gotta clean beforehand.
[283:48.52]Plus, I don't know.
[283:49.86]I feel like if you order food or you get delivery or you go into a restaurant right before it closes, I feel like you're lowering the quality of the food that gets prepared for you.
[283:59.91]If you go in like five, ten minutes before the store closes, they're just like, okay, what did he order?
[284:05.17]Just fucking throw it together.
[284:10.32]I want to get out of here.
[284:11.06]It's time for me to fucking go, man.
[284:14.10]No, not because they spit in it.
[284:16.84]No, absolutely not.
[284:18.04]I'm just talking about like the quality of the craftsmanship of the food.
[284:21.97]You know, at like five o'clock when you're there and you're a chef and you're working.
[284:27.00]you're okay you're there and you're doing it okay yeah what time is it now I got like another four or five six hours here like I can like working but like it's time for you to go home at like 11 55 you're at like the end of night you might be tired you've worked all day and like some dude comes in and wants like a steak and you're like okay fuck uh you know I'm gonna be a little cloudy upstairs and you don't get the highest quality of food you might possibly be able to receive
[285:00.87]So I don't, I usually, if I'm not going to be able to order something at least 20 to 30 minutes before the store, at least 30 minutes before they close, I typically don't do it.
[285:10.60]I got ravioli in the fridge.
[285:11.70]I'll be fine.
[285:18.68]Go.
[285:19.52]Just go.
[285:20.26]Try Wendy's.
[285:20.96]No, I don't want to.
[285:23.08]I'm not driving anywhere.
[285:27.69]I want to be lazy and have somebody bring me the food.
[285:37.77]Ravioli ravioli.
[285:38.79]Give me the formioli.
[285:39.87]No, I've already I'm not going I'm not doing it I'm not like going I'm not leaving the stream.
[285:43.77]I'm not going I'm staying and we're finishing the bits Then I got ravioli upstairs, I'll be fine By the way No never Getting food But uh, thank you to
[286:09.67]Thank you, John Cena, for life.
[286:12.67]And happy birthday to Lacey.
[286:14.57]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1 last stream.
[286:16.25]You said I had a supercomputer because I was able to render something in the background while watching your stream.
[286:20.66]It's just an i7-7700.
[286:23.78]Not top of the line, he says, but it gets the job done.
[286:26.52]That's a good, that's a great processor.
[286:29.84]That's a good one.
[286:32.62]Perhaps Source Filmmaker doesn't take a lot of processing power when compared to something like Maya.
[286:37.73]Rendering still takes a day or more.
[286:40.01]Maybe someday we'll have processors to render stuff within seconds.
[286:44.33]But that's what you have that NVIDIA RTX for.
[286:50.66]Light ray tracing.
[286:57.94]But, yeah, Dr. Clay, that's... I really do hope that one day we get a...
[287:06.24]You know, I say this, but at the same time, that would be kind of scary.
[287:10.02]Imagine processing power increasing by, like, a thousand percent.
[287:14.51]That's just... That's so much.
[287:17.15]What would it be used for?
[287:20.39]Who knows?
[287:24.29]Thank you, Swiggity Swanky, for the one dollar.
[287:26.01]Your Mickey Mouse has an uncanny resemblance to a horror monster or something.
[287:34.21]What the fuck is that?
[287:36.38]What is this?
[287:40.85]What is this?
[287:42.73]Where is this from?
[287:49.71]Did Disney make this?
[287:51.51]What the hell?
[288:01.94]No, that can't be right.
[288:12.63]Is that supposed to be me he's throwing the brick at?
[288:16.91]Probably.
[288:20.03]But thank you, Swiggity Swanky.
[288:21.23]Thank you, P... Peter.
[288:24.38]Thank you, Peter.
[288:24.80]I love your show.

[288:33.76]I want to apologize for my incessant requesting that you play Far Cry 1 on stream.

[288:44.74]Thank you for being there for me to make me laugh whenever I'm down.
[288:48.78]Who said you were annoying?
[288:49.63]I never said you were annoying.

[289:02.28]Oh, God.

[289:06.76]When?
[289:06.96]No, I didn't.

[294:53.69]I promise you that'll never happen.
[294:56.54]I only have a certain amount of gas in the tank, and once it's expelled, that's it.

[295:10.79]Sometimes a little longer, sometimes a little less.
[295:13.81]That's my... I turn into a pumpkin after that shit, guys.
[295:18.31]After four to six hours, it's... I gotta go.

[295:32.60]But also sometimes... How many times have you seen me stream for like two to three hours?
[295:37.24]It happens infrequently, but it does.
[295:43.55]I gotta go.
[295:43.95]I gotta get out of here.
[295:46.89]But I'll never do a 24-hour.
[295:48.35]Ever.
[295:50.21]I would never... I would not be able to make it past a 12-hour stream.
[295:55.47]No.
[295:56.36]Not gonna happen.

[297:44.25]But please take care of yourself.
[297:46.47]Thank you so much for your $2.
[297:47.65]I wish you the best.

[297:56.14]But thank you.
[297:56.58]Thank you, Kill Code, for the $1.
[297:57.92]Check this out, Jeremy.
[297:58.64]It's the first clip I ever made of you.
[298:01.82]It's the first clip you've ever made.
[298:03.48]Charles is a natural reader.
[298:10.35]It's a one-word story.
[298:12.53]What the fuck?
[298:13.29]What the fuck am I doing?
[298:15.31]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[298:17.43]Let's watch this.
[298:18.04]This is a fucking sicko on stream.
[298:29.80]This is when me, Vinny, and Criken played together.
[298:32.97]Not at all that.
[298:33.73]Not at all that.
[298:36.29]Charles is a natural reader who reads things online.
[298:39.81]It's a text-to-speech application.
[298:42.55]Oh.
[298:43.33]Is there a way we can access it, too?
[298:45.29]Or is it?
[298:45.79]Yeah, I just linked it to you.
[298:46.89]So I'm going to type it in that box, and then we can have Charles read it.
[298:53.21]Perfect.
[298:53.51]Okay.
[299:00.15]Alright, so... Sometimes, like, people show me things that I've done and I'm just like, I watch it and I go, who fucking did that?
[299:11.91]Well, I mean, it makes sense.
[299:12.69]There's like 50 of us.
[299:14.63]But thank you for that.
[299:15.79]Thank you, Killcode.
[299:18.57]Thank you, Sticky Brick, for the $3.50.
[299:20.05]Hey, Jeremy, somebody played September at work during closing and it made me think of your stream.
[299:25.55]The menial closing work that usually seems so boring flew by.
[299:28.79]I was moving in sync with the beat while mopping the floor and pretty soon everybody else joined me.
[299:34.71]The people who I considered my co-workers actually became my friends tonight.
[299:38.94]Everything went great and I can truly say it was the best night of work ever, thanks to you.
[299:42.88]That is, until I got locked in the dance-in oven.
[299:46.94]I was about oh god that's fine and that's fine we can take that part but let me tell you something Earth wind and fire has that spell on people you shouldn't be thanking me you should be thanking the incredible dedicated musical talent of Earth wind and fire because that's what got you on your feet that's what got you and your friends out there and that's how you made those friends
[300:15.78]Thank you.
[300:16.64]Sticky brick.
[300:17.24]Thank you, JakeGames, for the $1 stream.
[300:18.78]It's been a fever dream.
[300:19.60]Thank you.
[300:21.77]Thanks a lot, JakeGames.
[300:26.43]It was pretty wild.
[300:28.03]I was in the chat earlier, before the stream started, and I remember I was just mentioning, like, hey, this one might get a little weird.
[300:34.27]There's, like, drugs in this one.
[300:36.41]And never did I think that we were gonna get half that stuff to happen, so that was fucking hilarious.
[300:45.45]That's what you get.
[300:46.61]That's how you get into the dancing oven.
[300:51.62]God.
[300:53.02]But some of that stuff was just... I wish I could go back and experience some of that stuff again and not know it was there.
[301:02.09]That was, it was so... The Sims 4 stamp of approval.
[301:08.13]The Sims 4, all the DLC packs that are like 40 fucking bucks?
[301:13.68]Nope.
[301:14.84]But it's a fun game.
[301:20.09]A little, you almost broke TOS.
[301:23.35]What?
[301:25.25]No, I didn't.
[301:26.57]What are you talking about?
[301:27.75]I almost broke TOS.
[301:30.25]How?

[303:02.29]I did too.
[303:05.91]The portion with the dog, and the pee, and the guy taking his dog out, and... But he didn't take his dog out, he took, he walked his dog in his house.
[303:16.83]I can't even think about it.
[303:18.91]It'll make me laugh.
[303:23.37]Oh.
[303:25.85]God.
[303:26.21]Thank you, It's Weenie, for the $1.
[303:27.35]Thank you, Killgen, for the $1.
[303:28.67]Is this psychotic fever dream finally over?
[303:30.67]Yes.
[303:31.75]For now.
[303:33.03]For now.
[303:34.45]Positively Inhuman, thanks for the $1.
[303:36.45]Thank you for such a legendary stream.
[303:37.71]You're truly an amazing streamer.
[303:39.63]Hope the move goes well and you get to see many more streams in the future.
[303:42.95]Keep on keeping on, man.
[303:43.87]Thank you, Positively Inhuman.
[303:47.23]I hope the move goes well, too.
[303:48.33]Been looking forward to it for a while now, so.
[303:51.24]It's almost here.
[303:53.94]This washing machine.
[303:56.74]Thanks for the $10, this washing machine.
[304:01.38]Good God, this stream was somehow even better than Thursday's stream.
[304:05.02]My sides didn't even have enough time to recover.
[304:07.86]Love your work, Jerma.
[304:08.55]P.S.
[304:08.81]I make a living as a digital artist, which means I'm at a desk most of the day and rely on podcasts for some entertainment.
[304:15.10]If I thought about doing a podcast, I would totally listen to it.
[304:18.92]Yes.
[304:19.92]The plan actually is I've talked about this.
[304:27.95]Maybe a month or two ago.
[304:29.77]How I wanted to add just a random podcast where I just hang out and talk.
[304:37.56]No plans.
[304:38.70]We actually don't have a plan.
[304:41.96]And just talk about whatever the fuck we want for like two or three hours or something.
[304:48.85]Or maybe have one topic that we touch upon or two topics that maybe you guys will choose from the Discord or something.
[304:56.85]Was it you who said you were going to be on the official podcast?
[304:58.89]I was.
[305:00.05]I was already on the official podcast.
[305:01.75]It is available to listen on iTunes and it is available to listen on YouTube.
[305:06.04]Check it out.
[305:11.03]Or SoundCloud.
[305:11.65]That one works too.
[305:14.71]But thank you, This Washing Machine, for the 10 bucks.
[305:17.45]Hope that answers your question.
[305:18.49]But eventually, yes, I do.
[305:20.73]Once or twice a month.
[305:22.85]Chubby Kitten, thanks for the $1.
[305:23.94]I've been so busy with school and work that sometimes catching a stream is tough.
[305:27.26]Responsibilities suck.
[305:29.16]But you're great and you make life a little better.
[305:33.16]Thank you, Chubby Kitten.
[305:37.08]Life can get hectic sometimes, but...
[305:42.18]I'm happy to be able to make you laugh and make you happy.
[305:48.89]Please let me know if I'm not doing that.
[305:52.23]Because that's what I want to do.
[305:55.83]Thank you, DivUSP for the $1.
[305:57.34]Also, Jerma, on a more serious note, you need to chill out.
[306:01.21]what you yelling for lay back it's all been done before and you could only let it be you will see I like you the way you are when you are driving your car and you're talking to me on one-on-one but you become somebody else around everybody what is this oh this is those are lyrics those are lyrics to a song
[306:29.03]I think that's Avril Lavigne.
[306:30.71]That's complicated by Avril Lavigne.
[306:35.47]Thank you.
[306:36.39]Thank you, CluelessSniper for the $1.
[306:38.85]These sim streams were absolutely fantastic.
[306:40.69]I'd love to see you come back to it.
[306:41.89]In the meantime, good luck with the move.
[306:43.23]Jerma, Jerma, heart.
[306:45.35]Thank you.
[306:47.91]Thank you, BobbyBob for the $1.
[306:51.43]Could I read this poem out loud?
[306:56.76]Um...
[307:04.23]The poem on the wings of the hospital there were growing cinders and would shine.
[307:12.14]What is this?
[307:18.56]Is that another song No more songs, alright, let's keep going Thank you Bob boy for your poem That's a slam poetry thing.

[308:02.64]Dr. Clay for the $1.
[308:03.60]This is honestly one of my favorite streams to watch.
[308:05.39]Thanks for the laughs.
[308:06.73]The fact that death just felt like singing some karaoke is hilarious.
[308:09.94]I almost want to buy the game just because of how funny this mod is.
[308:13.22]Looking forward to the music stream, by the way.
[308:18.04]half the stuff tonight that happened was as if I planned it and tried to make it happen without you guys knowing you know what I mean I would if I would have watched that I would say holy shit this guy like went into the code and like made fucking Adam Sandler come back from the dead and stab somebody so half that shit you couldn't fucking even write half the stuff that happened
[308:48.46]Can you post the stream on YouTube?
[308:49.58]I need to see what happened.
[308:51.52]I mean, you can watch it.
[308:53.12]Right when I press the stop streaming button, go to videos, you can watch the whole thing.
[308:57.40]It's available for two months on Twitch.
[308:59.49]And then it is backed up by various channels, various archive channels, I think, do it.
[309:06.73]There's a specific channel that archives.
[309:08.93]What is this?
[309:10.45]Somebody just text me.
[309:12.75]Yeah, you can watch the whole thing right now, can't you?
[309:17.70]I think so.
[309:20.58]But thank you to Darkstar for the $1.
[309:25.90]Can you put off the B video ban one more day?
[309:28.76]I have just one more to make and it'll be my masterpiece.
[309:33.18]Hold on to it.
[309:34.88]Hold on to it.
[309:39.72]You can bring it back after the green screen.
[309:45.29]You're allowed to bring that back after the green screen.
[309:49.26]Am I still getting food before midnight?
[309:50.60]No, I gave up on it.
[309:51.59]I have food in the fridge.
[309:55.25]But, thank you, Darkstar.
[309:58.07]Hey, Raincoat!
[309:59.51]Thanks, Raincoat, for the $7 here, Raincoat.
[310:01.91]Shamrock.
[310:03.15]Shamrock, Shamrock.
[310:04.93]I lived in Vegas for a bit as a wee lad, and I worked at Caesars.
[310:08.99]I met R2-D2, Paris Hilton's sister, and had my ass smacked by Pete Rose.
[310:15.98]Can't wait to hear your stories.
[310:17.33]You're going to have a lot of them and much success.
[310:19.45]Thanks as always.
[310:20.19]Much love.
[310:22.17]Fucking Pete Rose.
[310:24.31]Jesus.
[310:25.79]True story.
[310:27.35]What the fuck?
[310:32.28]What, like the fucking baseball guy?
[310:33.84]Like the guy that cheated at baseball?
[310:38.86]That Pete Rose?
[310:39.20]Pete Rose?
[310:51.60]He owns a sports memorabilia store in the shop.
[310:54.54]Yeah, him.
[310:55.32]What a fucking weirdo.
[311:04.95]What a bastard.
[311:06.81]But anyways.
[311:08.47]Yeah, I look forward to Vegas.
[311:09.35]I look forward to living there.
[311:12.11]He didn't really cheat.
[311:13.21]Yeah.
[311:15.43]He didn't show.
[311:16.01]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[311:16.75]He bet on baseball.
[311:18.28]Didn't he bet on the games he was playing in or something?
[311:22.79]Something like that.
[311:27.94]But, yeah.
[311:28.58]Thank you, Raincoat, for the seven bucks, and I look forward to the stories.
[311:33.78]But thank you, Dr. Clay, for the one dollar.
[311:35.10]I didn't mean to sound ungrateful or rather spoiled about the processor.
[311:38.50]No, no, no, no, no.
[311:39.76]I'm just fucking around.
[311:41.40]I'm just teasing you.
[311:43.60]I just didn't want to brag or anything.
[311:45.18]A processor that manages to render high-quality content within a few seconds actually sounds like it would be fire hazard.
[311:50.63]I actually really miss the 2D animation industry in movies.
[311:53.97]I hope it comes back someday.
[311:55.64]No offense to CGI, but 2D is a bit of a lost art these days.
[312:01.82]I agree.
[312:03.40]I think that cell animation really should see a return, and it's still used a lot, effectively, but major motion picture-wise, it has kind of shit the bed, unfortunately.
[312:19.61]But no, I'm just messing around with you, Dr. Clay.
[312:22.51]Don't worry, man.
[312:25.57]Hey, Painter, thanks for the $1.
[312:27.83]Do a ravioli facecam stream.
[312:29.75]No, I'm eating ravioli.
[312:30.57]I'm going to bed.
[312:32.51]I'm not going to turn the stream on.
[312:33.73]I'll do my in-bed stream in like a week.
[312:36.98]CyanTF2, thanks for the $2.
[312:39.66]Your name has that in it.
[312:40.60]That's why I said it.
[312:41.18]$1 from CyanTF2.
[312:43.89]When someone finds out what you do for a living and they want to see, is there a go-to video you use? If so what is it?
[312:49.00]Um, none. None.
[312:52.00]I just- I just say the words online media.
[312:58.00]And that's it.
[312:59.00]I've showed videos to people before and they stopped talking to me, didn't I tell you that story?
[313:04.78]I was like, there's some girl that found out that what I did.
[313:08.08]This is like a couple of years ago, at least.
[313:12.13]And she knew my, she was like a friend of my sister's.
[313:16.53]And she was visiting for like a week or something like that she was hanging out.
[313:19.00]And my sister mentioned: Oh hey, you know, he's like a he's like a YouTuber.
[313:23.00]And I'm like no don't say I'm not no I'm not really though like I mean a guy a little bit like this is-
[313:27.00]I had like 150-200000 subscribers at this point.
[313:30.00]And I'm like nah I mean like not really like I mean I like that sometimes for fun, you know?
[313:36.00]And uh, she wanted to see a video and my sister was like: Oh show- show her Otto's- the Otto video.
[313:42.00]And I'm like: NO!
[313:46.64]What Otto video? On my iPhone? I don't know?
[313:49.00]And she saw it. She didn't-
[313:51.00]She put it up on-
[313:54.00]She took her phone and watched Otto's Big Adventure 2.
[313:59.00]And the look on this girl's face was just silent, a little irritated, not even one smile, no chuckle, it was just like...
[314:10.89]Like that is what she, that is what I did to her, right?
[314:14.63]That is like what I did for work to her.
[314:18.01]And it was just an unbelievable amount of disgust.
[314:21.07]Just, oh, okay.
[314:23.41]Like you make like dumb voiceover dog videos that suck.
[314:29.44]What?
[314:29.80]That's why you hate the auto video.
[314:31.36]It makes sense.
[314:32.00]No, I don't hate the auto video.
[314:33.52]I despise that video and I want it removed from the internet and I'm going to get it removed from the internet.
[314:37.58]I'm going to contact YouTube and have them remove it permanently.
[314:43.40]No, I love that video.
[314:47.34]That's like... I love those.
[314:48.58]Those two videos, they're so stupid.
[314:52.96]Quick, download it.
[314:54.90]No, it's not... I'm not gonna say... I'm kidding.
[314:58.52]But... Yes.
[315:02.52]It is weird.
[315:03.02]Like, people... Here's the problem, right?
[315:04.96]Let me tell you... This is like a super first world problem.
[315:08.92]But...
[315:10.59]Oh, hey, what do you do for a living?
[315:12.13]Oh, fuck, okay.
[315:13.03]I have to explain to this person all this stuff because you need a bunch of precursors to understand what's even going on, right?
[315:20.29]Oh, I make videos.
[315:21.22]You make videos.
[315:22.54]What?
[315:23.38]What are you talking about?
[315:25.16]I upload videos to YouTube.
[315:28.18]Hold on, you make videos and upload them to YouTube and somebody pays you.
[315:30.68]Well, no, I mean, it's not like that.
[315:32.26]I mean, do you work for a company?
[315:34.26]No, I mean, no.
[315:34.96]Well, how do you make money?
[315:35.70]Because ads and, well, there's ads.
[315:37.50]What do you mean ads?
[315:38.32]You sell ads?
[315:39.43]You like sell advertisements on your videos?
[315:41.15]No, there's like a YouTube ad.
[315:42.07]I don't know, just do it.
[315:44.01]Online media.
[315:48.55]And then the people just, people, that's so vague that people don't even care.
[315:52.87]So they go, oh, what do you do for a living?
[315:54.03]Oh, I do online media.
[315:56.43]Oh, okay, that could be a million different fucking things and I don't give a shit.
[315:58.81]I'm not going to ask you any more questions about it.
[316:00.87]Because I give, whatever, I don't care, right?
[316:02.85]That's what that person's thinking.
[316:07.74]And I will never use the term, no, I'm an influencer, I'll never use that word.
[316:11.68]I hate that fucking word.
[316:12.58]That word sucks.
[316:16.00]That's such a dumb word.
[316:17.78]No, I'm not a journalist.
[316:21.60]I'm not a journalist either.
[316:25.65]No, guys, I'm not, none of, I'm... Online media.
[316:30.69]That's it.
[316:39.66]You're a web net chef.
[316:41.42]That's actually, that's kind of good.
[316:46.78]You're a funny tuber.
[316:55.24]Describing what a streamer is is way harder than explaining what a being a YouTuber is, but that's like the next level.
[316:59.72]That's the next step, you know?
[317:06.13]I mean, entertainer works too, but then that's when they want to start asking questions.
[317:12.55]Then they start to want to know way more.
[317:16.54]I'm an entertainer.
[317:19.50]What?
[317:21.51]At some point, I'm just gonna do like... I'm gonna do one show in Vegas.
[317:25.19]And then I'm gonna... I'm just gonna say I'm like a lounge fucking singer in Vegas.
[317:28.19]And that's what I'm gonna use for what I do for work.
[317:33.83]I'm gonna try to do a show in Vegas.
[317:36.07]And sell three tickets to like my mother, my father, and like one of my buddies.
[317:41.43]Just absolutely bomb on stage.
[317:44.43]None of the jokes land.
[317:45.50]But I'm gonna put it on my resume.
[317:46.56]And that's the top of the list.
[317:47.38]That's the last... My last work.
[317:49.64]My last employment was...
[317:52.24]Stay on stage at Vegas as a fucking funny guy.
[318:01.18]Your parents are going to boo you too.
[318:02.42]Probably.
[318:03.25]No, they wouldn't.
[318:03.89]My mother's very supportive of me.
[318:05.57]Come on.
[318:11.15]Anyways, we're getting to the end here.
[318:13.51]Thank you, Doubled11 for the $1.
[318:15.83]It is a Twitch clip.
[318:21.00]Everyone appears to be an expert at ninja rope, but everyone's just getting lucky What?

[319:16.46]No, because then you go through that.
[319:17.64]That's how you get down the clown route.
[319:19.60]I am not a goddamn clown.
[319:22.82]Oh, I'm an internet buffoon.
[319:23.96]So you're a clown.

[320:28.94]What does he do for work?
[320:30.86]Oh, he's an online internet buffoon entertainment personality that trades cryptocurrencies for a living.

[320:42.78]I'm just curious.

[321:12.63]You found my dollar.
[321:13.59]Or take it, bit by bit, you greedy...
[321:18.68]What's with the poetry tonight?
[321:19.76]There's like three or four different poems here.
[321:25.86]Minecraft streamer.
[321:26.94]Nope.
[321:27.38]I have not... You have to stream... No.
[321:29.59]You guys, listen.
[321:31.89]For you to be classified as a Minecraft YouTuber or an Overwatch streamer or a Hearthstone YouTuber, right?
[321:40.33]Video game.
[321:41.19]Video game YouTuber.
[321:43.30]On the point of entry there, you have to have at least...
[321:49.31]20 to 30 episodes of hearthstone like episode 1 2 3 4 up to 20 you gotta stream hearthstone for like a hundred hours or like 50 hours before you are a hearthstone streamer I played Minecraft like seven times and I made like maybe 16 videos no I didn't I made like eight videos way less than that
[322:14.82]Eight of my 1,000 YouTube videos were Minecraft related.
[322:18.85]And I was just jumping on a goddamn bandwagon.
[322:21.75]I saw how popular it was and I looked around and I was like, what the fuck?
[322:24.27]I can do this shit and I can get in there and make blocks.
[322:27.69]And it was easy.
[322:30.91]And then I realized after like four or five videos and like six to 12 hours in the game, I was like, I don't want to do that.
[322:36.93]I don't like this at all and I don't want to do it.
[322:45.49]22 more Minecraft?
[322:46.13]That's more Minecraft videos than I've made.
[322:55.38]That's true.
[322:56.82]I have probably made, look, I have probably made more Minecraft videos than most of you in here, haven't I?
[323:03.97]How many people are here right now?
[323:05.09]Just hanging out at the end?
[323:07.65]Let's see.
[323:09.97]There are 1,234 people here hanging out.
[323:13.72]So, I guess that's true.
[323:15.18]I probably have made more Minecraft videos than a thousand of you in here.
[323:24.73]Fuck.
[323:28.12]This is like 2011, 2012 YouTube.
[323:29.18]I didn't just make those videos like a week ago.
[323:38.26]I made a bunch.
[323:38.88]See?
[323:39.14]Commander C made a bunch of Minecraft videos.
[323:40.74]I bet they're fucking awesome.
[323:41.70]Go watch Commander C's Minecraft series.
[323:45.39]Go watch those Minecraft videos.
[323:52.73]Okay.
[323:57.35]Let me sell out.
[323:58.07]No, he said he had Minecraft videos, and I'm sure he has good Minecraft videos.
[324:04.94]Okay.
[324:09.37]I made shitty Minecraft videos in 2011, then I deleted them.
[324:12.99]Take a note out of my book.
[324:14.63]Well, that's funny you say that, because I have deleted at least eight of them.
[324:19.81]So... I took a note.
[324:24.00]I didn't take the whole page.
[324:24.94]I ripped it in half.
[324:31.40]I made eight to ten, I think.
[324:34.91]You have them archived.
[324:38.99]Online media, you know.
[324:40.15]That's what we do here.
[324:43.79]Anyways, thank you Killcode for the $1.
[324:46.33]This was Cocoronis' art that they made.
[324:48.15]This is awesome.
[324:57.06]And look it.
[324:58.92]Our relationship was cut too short.
[325:02.02]It only lasted about
[325:04.66]Less than six hours.
[325:07.68]That's awesome, though.
[325:08.29]Thank you, Cocoronas.
[325:10.39]And thank you, Killcode, for putting a clickable link here.
[325:13.63]Thank you, man.
[325:17.13]Gondurlane, thanks for the $1.
[325:18.27]I'm already thinking about you not streaming for a while, and I'm already getting sad about it.
[325:21.36]We'll miss you.
[325:23.42]Also, on another note, is there any pattern on you picking recommended games from the Discord or is it random?
[325:29.56]It's just random.
[325:31.56]I take a look.
[325:32.82]I say, hey, that sounds like a pretty fun idea.
[325:35.04]That game sounds like fun or that thing sounds like fun.
[325:39.18]That's it.
[325:40.50]That's really all it takes.
[325:44.48]But don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.
[325:47.50]I'll be back.
[325:49.77]It's going to have to take a couple weeks off over the course of the next two months.
[325:55.72]And I will let you know well in advance of when they happen.
[325:57.56]I'm obviously telling you now.
[325:59.90]After Tuesday, it's going to be a week.
[326:03.70]You'll be gone.
[326:05.62]No, I'll tweet, like, some shitty joke.
[326:08.49]I'll make, like, a couple Twitter videos.
[326:10.91]I'll eat, like, a salad on video and say a joke.
[326:16.53]Why would that be funny?
[326:17.59]I don't know why that would be funny.
[326:19.20]But thank you to Two Heck for the... Bobby Bob, thanks for the one dollar.
[326:27.48]This isn't a song or it's bait.
[326:28.68]I just want to show Chad a really good poem.
[326:30.60]Could you read it or show it?
[326:33.50]Hey, I'll just link it.
[326:37.34]Here's Poetry Foundation.
[326:38.56]Here it is.
[326:39.50]Here's a good poem.
[326:40.67]It's called Between the Walls.
[326:45.08]You're going to get gnomed?
[326:46.16]I've got to be careful.
[326:46.74]That's the thing about links, man.
[326:47.74]It could be a gnome embedded in here.
[326:52.36]Who's knocking?
[326:52.80]It was me.
[327:07.25]To the window, to the wall.
[327:09.17]That's not what this is.
[327:15.87]uh but thank you Bobby uh where'd you go Bobby Bob Robert frost notes by William carlos williams back of the wings of the hospital where nothing will grow like cinders which shine broken pieces of green bottle
[327:45.85]Hmm.
[327:50.58]Hmm.
[327:50.84]It's called Between Walls.
[328:01.55]Trying to process what it is.
[328:03.65]Thank you, though, Bobby Bob.
[328:06.36]Snapsack.
[328:11.53]Hey, Paincer.
[328:13.49]Thanks for the $1, Paincer.
[328:14.49]Are you going to stay in touch with Burgah Boy when you move to Vegas?
[328:17.74]And does he get royalties for being in Jerma Rumble?
[328:20.68]His royalties for being in Jerma Rumble was he got to jump off the top rope of a boxing ring.
[328:26.20]Something he's always wanted to do.
[328:28.22]That was his payment.
[328:28.98]That's what he loved.
[328:29.70]That was what he wanted.
[328:35.22]That's what he wanted for his payment.
[328:39.31]Yeah, of course I will.
[328:42.23]It's been very hectic lately, so it's been hard to keep in touch with as many people as I'd like to.
[328:47.27]Because obviously I'm focused on this.
[328:51.75]Moving.
[328:52.81]So we haven't seen each other in a little while, but yeah, he'll be coming down.
[328:56.33]Plus, remember, he's got a family now.
[328:58.61]It's not... Like, hey, come on over.
[329:01.79]Let's drink some ciders and be fucking idiots.
[329:05.65]Like, he's got a family.
[329:07.58]He's got kids.
[329:10.01]No, he's growing up, man.
[329:12.42]Still one of my good buddies.
[329:18.66]He had a kid?
[329:19.22]Oh, he had two kids.
[329:23.70]He's doing great.
[329:24.66]He is doing just great.
[329:33.10]My dad is the egg.
[329:34.40]Man, I wish I was that kid.
[329:39.44]Yeah, he's doing just fine.
[329:40.54]He's doing very well, actually.
[329:45.04]He's Berga Dad now.
[329:49.48]But thank you to Roos Roos for the $1.
[329:52.30]That reminds me of the time I fucking had Connor McDavid over for dinner.
[329:56.66]I'm not even joking.
[329:57.48]I'm the guy on the left show.
[330:00.33]I'm the guy on the left show.
[330:06.05]What?
[330:10.19]Hold on, wait a minute.
[330:13.97]What?
[330:16.51]I've got a show stream.
[330:24.96]Me on the left.
[330:37.43]Oh, hi.
[330:44.98]I'll never be on the left.
[330:48.16]Yes, you will.
[330:50.36]That's me.
[330:50.80]Now I don't even know who it is.
[330:52.06]Everyone's claiming they're in this photo.
[331:02.91]How many hockey fans do you think are in here, man?
[331:06.11]Somebody just wrote that.
[331:12.51]That's fucking...
[331:15.20]I don't know who that is.
[331:20.95]Who is that?
[331:27.05]Connor McDavid.
[331:29.68]That's Connor McDavid.
[331:33.56]Let's see, Connor McDavid.
[331:36.01]It's funny because it's funny you say that.
[331:37.29]I don't know, out of the three of those, if you didn't tell me you were on the left, I would not know who he was.
[331:42.21]You could have said he was on... Actually, you know what's funny?
[331:44.51]I thought he was the guy in the middle.
[331:46.31]Uh, it's not.
[331:46.65]He's actually the guy on the right.
[331:49.64]I thought he was the guy in the middle.
[331:51.72]That shows how much I know.
[331:58.30]So who's the guy?
[331:58.70]Is the guy in the middle your dad?
[332:00.64]Who's in the middle?
[332:10.16]So that's you, your dad, and Connor, uh... Connor, oh, what's his name?
[332:16.25]Connor McDavid.
[332:24.75]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[332:25.55]Is this just... Is this just bullshit?
[332:32.88]Wait, this notable life.
[332:35.43]Wayne Gretzky, Sidney Crosby, and Connor McDavid had dinner together in Toronto.
[332:44.33]It's not even you.
[332:45.97]Wait, are you one of these three people?
[332:49.63]Are you Wayne Gretzky?
[332:54.52]Hold on a minute.
[332:58.78]So you're not even in this picture.
[333:06.55]I swear to God I'm on the left.
[333:09.07]So you are either Wayne Gretzky, Connor McDavid, or Sidney Crosby.
[333:17.34]So who are you then?
[333:18.68]Which one of these three people are you?
[333:30.09]I'm the guy, he is that one.
[333:34.38]Guy on the left.
[333:35.40]Right, so he's Sidney Crosby.
[333:38.52]Are you actually Sidney Crosby?
[333:52.25]What?
[333:52.91]Are you for real?
[333:54.23]Are you actually in here?
[334:02.27]Cindy Crosby's watching the stream right now.
[334:04.11]That's cool.
[334:13.84]There's no way.
[334:14.94]You have to, okay, I'll send you a picture.
[334:16.76]You have to take a picture of you holding a sheet of paper that says, hey, Jerma985 Twitch chat, and then write 1216 AM 825 2018.
[334:31.84]And have your tongue out going like... Yeah, I want the year or two.
[334:47.63]None of this is even real.
[334:48.81]Let's go.
[334:50.33]Thank you for... Thank you, Mr. Crosby.
[334:54.59]I appreciate... Thank you for that.
[334:57.45]Thank you, Raincoat, for the $3.

[334:59.87]You're the modern-day Buster Keaton.
[335:02.38]Now, I'll lose them.
[335:03.48]I can't keep my wallet.
[335:04.34]I'll drop them.
[335:05.36]They make my wallet fat and they can't fit in my pocket.
[335:09.82]Thank you, Raincoat.
[335:10.56]Thank you, too.
[335:13.17]Dr. Clay, for the two bucks, I don't really have anything to say, but here's the rest of my bits for tonight.

[335:19.70]Thank you for the two bucks.
[335:23.07]Thank you, GarfieldTheMondayKiller, for the one dollar.
[335:26.50]Jerma, here's my opinion on your job.
[335:28.24]You should say that you're a ray of sunshine in the life of thousands of people worldwide.
[335:32.20]You're an online personality that has worked with some of the most talented people on the internet.
[335:36.32]You're also pals with the one and only Garfield.
[335:38.31]They're gonna be like, what, the Garfield?
[335:40.15]And you can just go, yeah, that's right, Garfield, for life, baby.
[335:43.33]That's how I see that conversation going down.
[335:44.97]Maybe leave out the whole Garfield thing.
[335:47.11]Well, I think that's a little, hey, what do you do for work?
[335:54.14]Hey, dude, what do you do for work?
[335:56.25]I'm a ray of sunshine in the life of thousands of people worldwide.
[335:59.59]I'm an online personality that has worked with some of the most talented people on the internet.
[336:03.53]The person's going to be like, holy shit, dude.
[336:05.83]I just wanted to know what you did.
[336:07.01]The person's going to go, dude.
[336:11.89]He's going to back up and be like, your breath stinks, dude.
[336:14.69]What?
[336:17.07]How close did I get?
