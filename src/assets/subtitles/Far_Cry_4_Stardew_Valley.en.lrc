[01:30.37]Hi guys.
[01:32.03]Good evening.
[01:32.79]Good afternoon.
[01:33.55]Good afternoon.
[01:36.88]So we have a predicament here.
[01:40.10]We have to decide what we're going to play tonight.
[01:42.70]Started a little late.
[01:44.26]Upload seems to be okay right now, so we can start late.
[01:47.21]It's okay.
[01:47.95]I had to eat.
[01:50.97]But we need to find out because if you're just joining us... Actually, I'll wait.
[01:54.39]I'll wait.
[01:54.71]I'll wait.
[01:55.61]This is an important poll.
[02:02.69]Wait till we get people in here.
[02:04.15]We're not playing sorcery.
[02:05.07]It does say I'm playing sorcery, but I'm going to change that in a minute.
[02:08.43]Once we find out what the hell we're actually doing.
[02:16.39]Let me do this real quick.
[02:21.07]Okay.
[02:25.07]So.
[02:27.07]Go vote here.
[02:30.37]Because we need to find out what I'm going to... Tonight's going to just be one of those nights where I just chill and play something.
[02:35.27]Not like the continuation of a series or anything like that.
[02:38.18]And it looks like Stardew Valley is in the lead right now.
[02:41.38]Or random co-op game with Etalyx.
[02:43.30]It could be anything.
[02:45.20]Could be anything.
[02:46.02]Etalyx was thinking about joining us tonight.
[02:52.12]Or it could be Fallout 4.
[02:53.76]I do want to start Fallout 4 eventually.
[02:56.36]Or it could be WoW Legion.
[02:58.02]You know, it's currently got 20 votes out of 400.
[03:01.01]You know, it could be that.
[03:03.39]You could see WoW Legion tonight.
[03:10.25]Yeah, there's a vote.
[03:11.89]You can vote by going here to decide what we're going to do tonight.
[03:16.47]We're going to let this go for a minute or two just because it's been very close to the people that have just been hanging out in chat, so...
[03:24.46]I'm gonna let that go while we just talk about some stuff.
[03:26.32]You know, we're gonna have a little talk stream.
[03:33.37]Think about Etalyx.
[03:34.19]Think about how lonely he will be.
[03:36.82]Well, thank you, Chrono Waster, for eight months.
[03:41.50]Yeah, guys, Etalyx is gonna be so lonely.
[03:44.47]He's sitting in the wings right now, like, where, like, I'm on a stage, I'm on a giant stage, and we're doing, like, a production of Shakespeare.
[03:51.35]And he's got, he memorized all of his lines, he's in the wings, he's playing Jebediah, whoever the guy in Shakespeare was, one of the Shakespeare cast members.
[04:00.18]He's in the stage left, and he's sitting there, he memorized all of his lines for the Three Witches, whatever that, whatever the Shakespeare play was, what was it, Three Witches?
[04:08.31]So he's back there, he knows all his lines, and then Stardew Valley wins.
[04:12.09]And he's just like, what?
[04:13.77]Oh, and he's got a big frilly neck on, big frilly cuffs, and he's in a full costume, full face makeup.
[04:23.84]Wow, Legion.
[04:25.02]It's so funny, I don't even know why I've put that on these polls.
[04:29.90]I, like, I deep down, I'm like, you know what, no one, that's not gonna win.
[04:33.34]It's never gonna win.
[04:36.74]WoW Legion right now is like Ralph Nader.
[04:40.43]It's just like, ah, it's not gonna win, but you know, it's WoW Legion.
[04:46.91]Oh shit, he just got political.
[04:48.01]You're not supposed to do that.
[04:53.93]Not supposed to do that.
[05:00.06]I voted for Legion.
[05:13.06]You're not getting the deposit back for that band for the musical.
[05:20.54]Microsoft XP Windows Pinball.
[05:22.62]Oh, I wish I could do that.
[05:26.89]So here's a little tidbit, some tidbits of information here, guys.
[05:31.01]Over the next couple of weeks, I'm going to be hiring somebody to do a full channel kind of design thing here.
[05:39.75]You know when somebody gives 100 bits or 200 bits or somebody subs and you get the little, oh, somebody subscribed or somebody gave some bits.
[05:48.14]I currently have the default ones right now, but in a couple weeks or in a few weeks, hopefully, this whole thing is going to be redesigned.
[05:55.34]There's going to be custom animations for each one of the bits.
[05:58.24]There's going to be a custom sub-animation.
[06:00.14]There's going to be music.
[06:01.92]I'm getting actual music.
[06:03.75]Actual starting soon screen, not this shitty high school indie film one that I'm currently using.
[06:10.29]Wait, what?
[06:12.05]Are there any clown car games to play?
[06:13.91]I don't think so.
[06:16.39]Why would you play a clown car game when you can just get in a real clown car?
[06:23.55]You don't need to even play the game.
[06:28.34]Hey, did Etalyx, did you vote for co-op?
[06:33.60]Animator's gonna get paid in bits.
[06:40.98]Well, from the looks of it, it looks like we're gonna do Stardew Valley.
[06:47.51]Mink fur Jerm is getting with the times.
[06:49.43]This scares me.
[06:50.27]Yeah, see what I'm talking about?
[06:51.07]See how that thing popped up and it was spinning around and it was purple?
[06:54.91]That's gonna be like a custom animation for this channel.
[07:02.77]I'm going to make them all fucking weird.
[07:06.67]I brought up one of your videos during a date, and now she won't call me back.
[07:10.32]This is your fault.
[07:15.08]Well, it technically is my fault, but you share at least half the blame for even bringing it up in the first place.
[07:24.39]Throw the chakras.
[07:27.76]Yeah, I wanna do something like ridiculous, like if somebody, cause, I don't know, you know like the people that have dropped like the hundred, hundred thousand fucking bits, what, a hundred dollar bits?
[07:36.20]It's, it, at this moment, it's like, da-ding, oh, you did it.
[07:40.41]Well, I, for, that like, I want that to be like a custom fucking animation.
[07:45.59]I want it to like play like a, like 20 second animation or something crazy.
[07:50.59]I want like the screen, I want there to be like a war on the screen of like animated characters.
[07:56.98]well I just kind of gave it away didn't I you know what I mean imagine just like a like keyed out like battle of all like these dumb characters like glue man fucking like punching a guy in the face like a chair breaking over somebody's head because I want that to be like a big deal you know what I mean because right now it's just like just make a hundred thousand bits play Paul Bearer
[08:28.14]Yeah, Paul Bearer comes out with the urn.
[08:29.68]Yeah, there's gonna be different animations for every single bit level.
[08:36.04]So a hundred bits will have like its own custom like fun animation.
[08:41.22]But like the fucking big numbers that people drop like I want those to be big deals.
[08:47.97]See like right there like imagine like glue man fucking just getting hit with a chair and like fucking somebody like screaming.
[08:55.05]Glue Man Powerball off the top turnbuckle.
[08:56.91]Stuff like that.
[08:57.85]Yeah.
[08:59.33]But thank you for the $10, dude.
[09:01.85]Thank you to Skuggington for your subscription.
[09:05.53]And thank you Thrillville for four months.
[09:07.09]Zap only stream.
[09:08.01]Greetings from Germany.
[09:08.63]Well, greetings, dude.
[09:09.89]Greetings from the United States.
[09:12.19]Specifically the East Coast.
[09:14.75]Alright.
[09:15.11]Well, it seems... It seems that Stardew Valley has won this poll.
[09:22.03]So if Etalyx is up for it, we'll see.
[09:23.75]I'm going to hold on.
[09:25.47]Give me one second.
[09:26.89]Give me one second, guys.
[09:33.85]Just a second here.
[10:40.29]No, no.
[10:41.41]I didn't mean it like that.
[10:43.15]No, no.
[10:43.97]Look, it was a vote.
[10:45.35]It was a vote.
[10:46.07]Hold on a second.
[10:47.69]We're live.
[10:48.07]We're live right now.
[10:48.63]We're live.
[10:51.59]I didn't... It was a poll.
[10:53.15]I didn't mean to.
[10:54.35]I put the poll out there.
[10:55.41]I know you were really looking forward to this.
[10:57.67]I can't believe you were just streaming what I just said.
[10:59.47]I'm so mad right now.
[11:03.75]Oh, shit.
[11:04.17]Oh, we got exposed.
[11:05.81]Oh, we just got exposed.
[11:08.77]It's rigged.
[11:09.01]Alright, here's what we're doing.
[11:14.81]Etalyx is so upset right now.
[11:18.96]Oh, it's a setup.
[11:19.96]Oh, we got some bits.
[11:26.12]He doesn't do anything?
[11:29.76]That's gotta be one.
[11:31.91]But yeah, we're going to do another poll because we're going to eliminate Fallout 4 and WoW Legion because this was too close.
[11:39.86]So Fallout 4 and WoW Legion have been deleted.
[11:43.06]We're going to give you a new poll.
[11:44.16]Stardew Valley or co-op game with Etalyx?
[11:47.83]Understand?
[11:48.85]Those are your two choices.
[11:50.25]Those are your two choices.
[11:51.87]You don't get other choices.
[11:54.93]Anyone who votes against me is banned.
[11:58.45]Yeah, you're only going to get two choices here.
[12:06.30]Let me make the poll real quick.
[12:11.60]The question is how many people are really angry at me right now.
[12:15.94]That's the real question.
[12:21.70]No, I can't do that.
[12:22.60]I was going to put prank call Etalyx' house as an option.
[12:26.86]I can't do that right now.
[12:29.42]And then we would play a game.
[12:33.98]Let's do, okay, Stardew Valley or co-op with Etalyx.
[12:41.82]Get everybody in the spirit for November 8th.
[12:45.51]November 8th.
[12:46.81]Who are you going to vote for?
[12:47.53]Are you going to vote for Stardew Valley on November 8th, or are you going to vote for Etalyx?
[12:52.19]Those are the two options.
[12:53.34]That's the national poll.
[12:55.14]Yeah.
[12:58.31]Alright, this is it.
[13:00.29]This is it.
[13:01.29]This is only going to happen for like a minute.
[13:03.27]You guys have one minute.
[13:11.82]This is your final chance to decide what you want to do tonight.
[13:19.37]So many people are going to be like, oh, this is so biased.
[13:21.91]He's like in the stream already.
[13:24.45]I'm here.
[13:25.06]Like, I'm getting a chance, the opportunity to like make my case to the people.
[13:29.66]Stardew Valley has no such voice.
[13:33.46]Oh, God.
[13:36.87]Well, what a rigged election.
[13:38.95]This is the equivalent of going to your voting booth and the person that is on the ballot is like right next to you yelling in your ear.
[13:48.69]Looking over your shoulder like, who are you going to vote for?
[13:50.49]Are you going to vote for the other guy or are you going to vote for me?
[13:52.55]I'm right here.
[13:53.59]Yeah, you're like in the booth filling out one of the two slots and you're in the booth with them just looking at them like, who'd you vote for?
[14:04.15]That's so funny to me.
[14:08.77]following every single person that's so I love it alright so what what what like random co-op game are we gonna play what do you think apparently what's the game quiet you're quiet I don't know I saw like four people just say that oh you are quiet oh wow not by that not that much but still kind of he's not quiet anymore whoa
[14:40.03]He's not quiet anymore.
[14:40.91]Am I quiet anymore?
[14:42.57]No, I guess probably not.
[14:45.22]You are very much alive.
[14:49.42]Alright.
[14:49.88]Vote Etalyx or get zapped.
[14:51.88]That's my new slogan.
[14:53.54]Get zapped.
[14:58.34]Alright, here's what we can do, okay?
[15:00.07]Here's the plan, alright?
[15:01.65]Fuck the poll, fuck the election, you know what I mean?
[15:04.11]It's a rigged election anyways, you know what I mean?
[15:05.75]So here's what we're gonna do, because... So, Etalyx, we can play... We're gonna play Far Cry 4.
[15:12.81]That's the plan.
[15:14.29]Okay.
[15:15.21]So, that's like the random co-op game, we can just run around and shoot things and be idiots.
[15:20.37]Mm-hmm.
[15:20.98]So in the meantime, because we both have to download that game...
[15:24.86]Yeah, right?
[15:25.77]Everyone can get a little something.
[15:27.93]You guys can get what you want.
[15:30.05]Elections are fucking rigged anyways.
[15:31.65]Remember Al Gore?
[15:32.41]Yeah.
[15:33.45]Both parties can be winners.
[15:35.91]Yeah, Al Gore lost by like 12 votes or something like that.
[15:38.67]Remember that?
[15:39.07]Remember that happened like 15 years ago, whatever it was?
[15:42.12]So while we download Far Cry 4, I'm going to play Stardew Valley.
[15:47.06]There you go.
[15:47.90]Everybody wins.
[15:48.24]Everyone wins.
[15:49.30]Everybody wins.
[15:52.24]Everybody wins.
[15:55.33]So let me open up Stardew Valley.
[15:56.71]We're going to start with that, and then while this is downloading, we're going to keep going.
[16:03.47]Do you think it would be faster for me to spectate you through Steam or just watch on Twitch?
[16:11.49]I bet Twitch is faster.
[16:13.29]Twitch probably is faster.
[16:14.33]Alright, let me change some things here.
[16:21.50]Stardew 1.0.
[16:27.27]No, 1.1, right?
[16:29.89]We should be on 1.1 now unless they've patched again.
[16:35.05]Well, I'm just going to say 1.1.
[16:41.23]Okay.
[16:42.63]Let's get going.
[16:44.62]So how do I make it so Steam continues to download Far Cry 4 while I play Stardew Valley?
[16:48.84]Because doesn't it stop?
[16:51.62]If you open up a game, doesn't it pause downloads?
[16:53.76]I think you can do it.
[16:54.74]It's in the settings somewhere.
[16:58.13]settings, downloads.
[17:01.93]Allow downloads during gameplay.
[17:03.46]There we go.
[17:06.38]I did not know that was even an option.
[17:08.02]Alright, so start a valley.
[17:11.06]Let's open her up.
[17:18.00]I haven't opened this in a long time.
[17:28.08]Here comes Stardew Valley.
[17:30.68]Remember this game, guys?
[17:33.84]Remember how fun this game was?
[17:35.16]Are you going to pick one of the new maps?
[17:38.38]Yeah.
[17:38.66]Are you serious?
[17:40.24]Which one?
[17:40.76]Are you going to pick the one where the bad guys come out at night and try to fight you?
[17:44.94]Yes.
[17:45.80]Like Minecraft?
[17:48.22]I don't even know what any of this means.
[17:49.74]Alright, give me one second.
[17:51.13]I need to get my windows in order.
[17:52.63]Do-do-do-do-do.
[17:57.90]Oh, look it, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:59.72]It's so nostalgic.
[18:02.14]I feel so nostalgic right now.
[18:03.94]Oh, look, there it is.
[18:07.02]Load game.
[18:10.31]Game crashed.
[18:12.95]So do I have to play with my old character?
[18:15.65]Game crashed.
[18:17.55]Do I make a new game?
[18:18.43]I think you should.
[18:21.35]Should I?
[18:23.61]That's how you can play on one of the new maps.
[18:26.07]Oh, okay, really?
[18:28.19]Alright, well, Detallix, because you're in the stream, you get to name the character.
[18:33.25]The first guy was Greg?
[18:34.51]First guy's name was Greg.
[18:42.14]How about... Do we want it to be male or female?
[18:44.92]Well, it's going to be male.
[18:46.44]Okay.
[18:46.62]I'm going to go with... I already named it, sorry.
[18:53.56]Oh, well.
[18:54.32]Name the farm.
[18:57.18]I cannot name things, okay?
[18:59.44]Greg 2, Farm 2.
[19:01.32]There you go.
[19:02.28]I got your names for you.
[19:05.00]Greg 2 is actually really popular right now in chat.
[19:08.15]Greg 2?
[19:10.01]Why Greg 2?
[19:10.95]Alright, fine.
[19:15.55]No, that's... No, I refuse.
[19:17.41]You don't want to be like human farmer?
[19:22.63]No, I don't.
[19:24.47]Uh, thank you to Minkfur.
[19:25.61]Thanks, NeverChutToPurple!
[19:26.75]Minkfur with the 1000.
[19:28.79]Watching Timur play Stardew will kill you mentally.
[19:30.93]It's awful, but I'll still watch it.
[19:32.59]Dagnabbit.
[19:33.98]Jeez.
[19:35.78]You're better at the game than I am.
[19:36.90]I don't think I am.
[19:39.50]You've played at least 20 hours more than me.
[19:42.00]Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'm good.
[19:43.24]Just because you do more of something doesn't mean you're good at it.
[19:45.04]Alright, name it Greg 3, and then everyone will be wondering, where's Greg 2?
[19:50.77]I can't, I ran out of characters.
[19:53.11]I was gonna name it 48, but you're 49, you can't.
[19:56.55]Thank you Baked Flakes for the 500.
[19:58.83]Doesn't like results, does another poll.
[20:02.01]No, that's not true.
[20:03.35]We're doing both, it doesn't even matter.
[20:04.95]Both of the top two things won, so we're doing both of them.
[20:08.87]So nobody lost, except for the people that voted for Legion.
[20:11.59]You lost.
[20:13.68]I would have voted for Legion.
[20:14.94]I lost.
[20:17.38]Thanks a lot, Heffizzle.
[20:19.49]Subscribing much appreciated me.
[20:21.95]You know we gotta get like Etalyx like to call out these subs to and like say like what's up?
[20:27.87]Now see him faster than me do I yeah, I do I feel like read them in chat the major bluetooth.
[20:34.10]Thanks major bluetooth So I think the maps are on the right panel.
[20:39.06]Okay, so what alright another poll you guys love these polls
[20:44.06]And I think the bottom one is the one where they attack you at night.
[20:47.99]Alright.
[20:48.63]Let's leave it to the audience.
[20:51.19]Riverland, forest, hilltop, or wilderness.
[20:56.87]Make another poll.
[20:57.57]I don't know.
[20:57.84]What's with me and straw polls lately?
[20:59.50]Straw polls are great.
[21:02.84]They're fun to do.
[21:06.06]What are the names again?
[21:08.70]Riverland, Forest, Hilltop, and Wilderness.
[21:12.46]Riverland, Forest, Hilltop, and what was the next one?
[21:20.53]Wilderness.
[21:21.31]We're doing another poll.
[21:25.26]Alright guys, here you go.
[21:28.18]While I make the character, go vote on where we are going.
[21:39.80]I don't even think we need to keep the poll going, because Wilderness seems to be winning.
[21:43.94]Because everyone wants to see you die a miserable, awful, nighttime death.
[21:50.44]Tim Machina.
[21:51.18]Oh, I managed to get the on-stream full Jupiter.
[22:00.21]Oh, he got it.
[22:00.95]He actually got it.
[22:01.59]Under pressure.
[22:04.45]Under pressure, full Jupiter.
[22:06.71]That's awesome.
[22:08.27]You never see that shit.
[22:10.26]The farm's name is Time Machina?
[22:12.94]Time Machina.
[22:15.26]No, I want to try to keep consistent with the theme here.
[22:18.82]How about, okay, how about, and you thought there is never a girl online.
[22:24.18]No, you got it wrong.
[22:26.05]It's, and you thought there is never a girl online.
[22:28.65]That's what I said.
[22:30.13]No, you said are online.
[22:33.37]Alright, the poll's over.
[22:35.25]Like, it's over.
[22:36.61]Wilderness is at 64% right now.
[22:41.93]Alright, yeah, that's it.
[22:43.56]Thank you for voting.
[22:45.68]We're done.
[22:46.22]274, yeah.
[22:48.14]Wilderness wins.
[22:50.78]Thank you for voting.
[22:52.12]Wilderness.
[22:54.64]Alright, let's get some, uh, of course we're gonna go with the dog.
[22:58.67]The time gun.
[22:59.41]Never trust purple back with the bits.
[23:03.47]In that garden.
[23:06.61]Alright, this guy, I don't like this guy.
[23:07.79]He doesn't look good.
[23:11.84]Alright, I'm gonna make my favorite YouTuber.
[23:13.80]Etalyx.
[23:19.04]That's what I have to say to that.
[23:21.46]You know what my favorite YouTuber is?
[23:23.20]Who?
[23:25.07]Like, real answer?
[23:28.03]Hold on, I'm making Sonic the Hedgehog.
[23:29.25]I can't even... Where's the blue?
[23:41.83]Where's blue?
[23:42.59]There we go.
[23:56.62]Sonic the head farm.
[23:58.64]Favorite thing?
[24:02.30]Oh, God.
[24:03.66]What's our favorite thing?
[24:08.92]Huh?
[24:09.40]You're naming things wrong.
[24:11.82]No, I'm not.
[24:12.84]Sonic the Hedgehog, Time Machine 9.
[24:15.40]And his favorite thing?
[24:18.70]Apples.
[24:19.48]Fruit, right?
[24:22.48]I knew it was going to be fruit related.
[24:24.18]Yeah, fucking fruits.
[24:25.82]No, um... Um... Chili dogs?
[24:32.54]Is that a meme?
[24:33.04]Is chili dogs a meme?
[24:33.80]Probably.
[24:38.17]Why is everyone saying- Oh, no, no, that's cause it's Sonic the Hedgehog.
[24:42.92]No, Sonic's favorite thing is Amy.
[24:44.86]Yay!
[24:48.90]No, his favorite thing is... Rings!
[24:57.13]Done.
[25:02.31]Oh, look, it's Santa Claus again!
[25:05.33]Oh, my son, yes.
[25:06.83]Oh, my very special grandson.
[25:08.29]We've already seen the shit.
[25:09.51]Skip it.
[25:13.73]Here we go.
[25:14.41]Here comes the bus.
[25:17.05]Beep, beep.
[25:17.81]Beep, beep.
[25:18.39]Beep, beep.
[25:27.50]So, Etalyx, you have to, like, guide me on everything I do.
[25:30.12]Because you're the smart one.
[25:31.76]It's going to be so annoying because it'll be a 30-second delay.
[25:34.80]Yeah, well, if I do something wrong, you have to make... yell at me.
[25:40.38]So what's the deal with this one?
[25:41.56]Will people attack you?
[25:43.90]Spoiler alert, Santa's dead.
[25:45.88]When night time comes, O2 does danger.
[25:49.62]I look like Dr. Wily.
[25:52.23]I don't even look like Sonic the Hedgehog.
[25:53.67]Hello, you must be Time Machine 9.
[25:55.17]I'm Robin, oh yeah.
[25:57.53]We've already seen this shit.
[26:00.19]What happened to Time Machine 1 through 8?
[26:02.31]We don't know.
[26:03.03]Sea Dogs, the pirate game.
[26:08.01]Oh, this is Sonic the Head Farm.
[26:14.07]It's not even correct.
[26:15.47]This is Sonic the Head Farm.
[26:20.06]Oh no!
[26:20.50]Oh my god!
[26:21.04]I'm so... I can't believe it.
[26:24.44]What's the matter?
[26:25.74]Sure, it's a bit overgrown, but there's some good soil underneath here.
[26:31.32]With a little dedication, you'll have it cleaned up in no time.
[26:34.79]Are you sure you clicked wilderness?
[26:36.33]Yeah.
[26:37.28]This looks standard.
[26:38.42]This does look standard.
[26:39.53]I clicked Wilderness, right?
[26:43.79]Did you?
[26:44.45]I swear to God I did.
[26:45.51]I clicked it like a hundred times.
[26:46.53]Okay.
[26:48.65]Maybe is it like standard plus night?
[26:54.09]This isn't the Wilderness.
[26:54.91]Are you guys sure the first cutscene is not just in the standard mode?
[26:58.51]I'm going to look it up.
[27:06.62]Yeah, moving into my old grandfather's cottage.
[27:09.05]Gotta rewind.
[27:10.03]My old grandpa's cottage.
[27:12.97]Okay, I think it looks the same in the top right quadrant.
[27:15.65]And then when you move... When you move south and west, it looks different.
[27:20.55]Really?
[27:21.81]Yeah.
[27:23.95]Not as different as the other three maps.
[27:26.95]Hmm.
[27:30.07]You must be tired from the long journey.
[27:31.63]You should get some rest.
[27:32.81]Tomorrow, you've got to redo this whole cutscene, even though I probably already made all these jokes before.
[27:39.39]So, ta-ta for now.
[27:42.21]Hey, just put it in my box, and I'll pick it up with my dinghy.
[27:53.75]Okay, so what does this mean again?
[27:55.59]What's the difference between the maps?
[28:00.02]Well, in the Willer's map, monsters spawn at night.
[28:03.12]Scales with your combat level.
[28:05.08]Really?
[28:06.04]There are special things you can find, I guess.
[28:10.76]There's a huge pond in the middle of it, I guess.
[28:13.90]And the other map is like... There's a hilltop map and a water map.
[28:17.80]So the water map is for fishermen.
[28:21.46]And the hilltop is for miners.
[28:22.91]Alright.
[28:24.61]Who cares?
[28:26.26]Let's go.
[28:26.58]Who cares?
[28:28.69]I don't, like, remember a game thing.
[28:29.71]You asked the question!
[28:31.67]Seriously, I don't know anything anymore.
[28:34.05]It's as if I just started the game again.
[28:36.57]Like, and I didn't even play it once.
[28:37.91]Who cares?
[28:38.85]Who cares?
[28:39.93]Watch TV.
[28:42.20]Give you recipes.
[28:43.96]Alright, this is not the right tool, right?
[28:45.84]I'm gonna be using the side.
[28:48.08]Yeah, now I remember.
[28:50.70]You gotta use the fucking Grim Reaper side to get rid of the shrubberies.
[28:53.91]You guys didn't think I knew that?
[28:55.11]I remembered that shit.
[28:59.41]Are you sure?
[29:00.63]Because you're using the axe.
[29:04.98]I've since changed.
[29:06.76]Oh.
[29:08.28]What's with my frame rate in this game right now?
[29:10.66]It's being all weird.
[29:11.44]1400 by 900.
[29:18.82]There's the lake.
[29:19.40]Zoom level.
[29:25.48]No, no, no, no.
[29:26.34]Go back.
[29:27.48]Oh, God.
[29:27.74]I'm going to throw up by looking at that.
[29:29.02]Hurry up.
[29:29.36]Well, go back before I seriously puke.
[29:31.30]It's going to happen really quick.
[29:35.54]Oh, look.
[29:36.06]That's awesome.
[29:37.18]You can see much more.
[29:38.12]I'm going to 90%.
[29:44.55]Why is this, like... Hold on a second, guys.
[29:49.21]Something ain't right here.
[29:49.93]No.
[29:51.63]No.
[29:59.27]Alright, now I gotta go to... God damn it!
[30:04.47]Please!
[30:05.95]1920 by 1080.
[30:08.61]None of this is right at all.
[30:11.59]What?
[30:11.97]How?
[30:13.22]How is this right?
[30:18.78]Okay.
[30:19.16]I like the cinematic.
[30:20.94]Very cinematic stream here with the black borders all around it.
[30:25.42]I got it.
[30:28.37]It's like I'm watching a movie.
[30:31.49]That's wrong.
[30:32.01]So what do I have to do?
[30:34.19]I have to go greet people and go... I gotta plant these parsnips, right?
[30:36.53]Alright, Alex, how do I do that?
[30:39.67]You have to, like, go to the soil, right?
[30:43.13]What?
[30:43.89]You gotta plant parsnips?
[30:45.70]How can I not break this shit?
[30:47.14]You've already got... Do you already have seeds?
[30:49.30]You got seeds?
[30:50.94]Alright, you need a hoe.
[30:52.44]It's all coming back to me.
[30:54.78]You gotta till the soil.
[30:56.24]You gotta clear some of that real estate.
[30:58.02]Make a little baby farm.
[30:59.54]You gotta water the crops.
[31:01.30]You gotta protect them from creepers.
[31:03.88]And skeleton archers.
[31:08.40]Oh, I forgot about how satisfying it was to cut down a tree.
[31:12.26]Makes that like... So we got 15 parsnips.
[31:24.43]I'm just gonna put him over here.
[31:25.81]I'm done.
[31:28.59]I give up.
[31:32.15]What?
[31:32.59]You beat me, game.
[31:34.39]Game, I'm done.
[31:35.69]I'm just kidding.
[31:37.51]What if it was that easily?
[31:39.67]Okay, so where's the hoe?
[31:41.95]There it is.
[31:43.11]How many parsips do I have?
[31:46.13]Fifteen or something?
[31:47.19]Yeah, fifteen.
[31:49.67]So, let's go... Uh...
[31:55.92]How many is that?
[31:57.18]Who gives a shit?
[32:04.26]Alright, five.
[32:05.22]One, two, three, four, five.
[32:06.70]Let's do that over here.
[32:10.88]Why does it do that?
[32:12.64]That's super annoying.
[32:14.55]Oh, are you like, it looks in the wrong spot?
[32:17.15]Because your mouse doesn't dictate which way you look.
[32:20.01]It's your keyboard.
[32:21.21]Are you serious?
[32:22.15]Okay, now we need the watering can.
[32:23.27]I remember this part.
[32:31.64]Ah, is everybody relaxed?
[32:32.80]He hasn't even had a WASD.
[32:34.48]I am WASD'ing.
[32:37.66]Who else is like, next is a relaxed right now?
[32:40.37]Etalyx, that didn't work.
[32:42.31]Etalyx, you lied to me.
[32:43.29]What?
[32:43.85]Etalyx, you're lying to me.
[32:46.45]Look at this.
[32:47.05]What?
[32:47.95]Look at this.
[32:48.49]It didn't happen that time, but look at this.
[32:52.67]What am I looking for?
[32:53.71]Why was that happening?
[32:54.77]Everything looks perfectly normal.
[32:56.43]It's turning me around.
[33:00.92]Sometimes you have to have a little nub when you guys know look we're fine How much time do I have 500 minutes now five five?
[33:14.78]Why did I do what?
[33:17.16]500 minutes Gold I'm gonna say gold pieces How much time I don't know dude.
[33:23.25]I'm fucking out of my mind 500 minutes
[33:30.04]Every time I'm alive, I just turn into a fucking moron.
[33:33.36]That's the World of Warcraft Mythic Plus 6 timer.
[33:36.32]Oh, yeah, I got 500 minutes left.
[33:41.38]I still feel frame-ready for some reason.
[33:43.08]I don't know why.
[33:46.38]Let me go over here and see this real quick.
[33:50.18]Thank you to Shinkai for your subscription.
[33:53.79]Also, thank you to Mink for Stop Breaking Things.
[33:55.77]I can't help it.
[33:56.49]I have to.
[33:58.05]The mouse dictates the nine tiles around you, so if you click any one specific tile around you, it'll target said tile.
[34:03.15]Anything outside your range will be straight ahead of you.
[34:05.29]Okay, I gotcha.
[34:07.25]The person is smarter.
[34:09.10]Yeah, Lucifer, my bro.
[34:11.02]Thanks, Lucifer, my bro.
[34:11.92]I bet you shower naked.
[34:13.54]Also subscribed.
[34:14.48]I do.
[34:15.72]No, I shower with, like, my t-shirt on.
[34:18.62]Thanks a lot, Weasel, for five months.
[34:21.98]Mink for dropping the bits.
[34:24.64]Mink for dropping the bits tonight.
[34:27.36]Thanks a lot, dude.
[34:29.12]And then thank you to Tanager4392 for six months.
[34:33.89]Does Germino parsnips are literally the worst crop in the game?
[34:36.61]They were free!
[34:38.37]Isn't it a quest?
[34:39.37]Don't you have a quest anyway for it?
[34:41.27]I woke up out of my bed and I had parsnips in my inventory.
[34:44.55]I didn't buy these things.
[34:46.97]Let's go check it out.
[34:50.44]How is this wilderness, by the way?
[34:52.70]I swear to God, I didn't do it right.
[34:55.22]Go, yeah, you did.
[34:56.10]Go bottom left.
[34:59.34]It should look different.
[35:01.78]Bottom left?
[35:03.48]Yeah, I mean, there's not like a giant lake on the standard map, like 10 feet away from your house.
[35:10.09]I think the rest of the map's the same.
[35:12.45]The differences in the maps are like your farmstead.
[35:18.24]Did you say there were monsters that came out at night?
[35:22.08]Apparently.
[35:22.54]I guess we're going to find out in 500 minutes.
[35:25.30]Where's my Steam controller?
[35:29.72]Can I use my Steam controller for once every two years?
[35:32.73]It's this game that I'm going to use it on.
[35:36.07]This is good for now.
[35:36.59]I don't want to clear out that much.
[35:41.41]I'll chop down this tree, too.
[35:42.33]Just get this ugly-ass thing.
[35:44.07]Back to bed.
[35:49.12]At 1.30 PM, I'm really that tired?
[35:51.28]Do I have any, like, fucking things to eat?
[35:53.42]Hold on, I'm gonna go to town and buy, like, a sandwich.
[35:56.62]No, I don't have enough time.
[35:58.84]You're just gonna pass out?
[36:00.88]I'm going to bed.
[36:01.34]Alright, we're refreshed.
[36:05.94]I feel like my house looks a little different than it did before.
[36:15.23]Oh, I got mail!
[36:16.49]You've got mail.
[36:18.66]Hello there, just got back from a fishy trip.
[36:20.94]You should come down to the beach sometime.
[36:22.39]I've got something for you, Willy.
[36:23.73]Ooh, got something for me, don't you?
[36:26.99]Willy.
[36:27.49]Thanks, Willy.
[36:28.47]I remember I had the watering can that watered like five tiles at once.
[36:38.74]It was great.
[36:43.88]Slept for 15 hours.
[36:49.33]Oh, I gotta refill my wallet.
[36:50.43]Now you're well and truly rested.
[36:52.77]You don't have to sleep for another two days.
[36:55.21]Yeah.
[36:55.75]Don't you guys know how sleep works?
[36:57.01]If you sleep for like 30 hours straight, you don't have to go back to bed for like 45 hours.
[37:04.02]Let's go buy some shit.
[37:07.56]With my 500 minutes.
[37:12.88]It's like that movie.
[37:16.21]With Justin Timberlake.
[37:18.45]JT?
[37:18.61]JT?
[37:20.58]Yeah, you know that movie, In Time, isn't that the name of the movie?
[37:22.96]Where they like, their currency is minutes.
[37:26.08]Is it really?
[37:29.21]I forgot about this part.
[37:30.87]You always wake up at 6am and no one's around for like 4 hours.
[37:37.37]To the beach.
[37:38.27]Visit the beach south of town before 5pm.
[37:40.25]Okay.
[37:43.70]My OCD is killing me.
[37:47.62]Don't worry.
[37:48.76]Everything's gonna be fine.
[37:49.60]I'm gonna do the crab pots this time.
[37:54.30]If you sleep for a whole month straight, you don't have to sleep forever.
[37:57.12]Yeah, that's right.
[38:02.16]There he is.
[38:03.42]Do you know about this guy, Etalyx?
[38:04.96]This guy sells you fish at, like, absorbent prices.
[38:08.78]Game is frozen.
[38:10.94]Sells you fish at what?
[38:13.53]Hold on.
[38:15.53]Hold on.
[38:17.63]Oh, there we go.
[38:21.57]Oh, there, son.
[38:22.70]Heard there was a newcomer in town.
[38:24.42]Good to finally meet you.
[38:30.08]I'm still trying to unwind from a month or so from sleep, you know.
[38:32.88]When you sleep for a month, it's pretty awesome.
[38:35.86]You get to stay awake for a year.
[38:37.66]Oh, Jesus.
[38:41.08]Oh, Jesus.
[38:44.91]Aronorth with the 5,000 bits.
[38:47.91]Oh my.
[38:48.33]That's a lot of money.
[38:49.49]You see what I mean?
[38:52.63]Like, okay, that went like... That's awesome.
[38:56.42]Thank you, Aronorth, by the way.
[38:57.60]That's really kind of you.
[38:58.88]But I want that to be like... We need a bigger splash.
[39:01.36]Well, no.
[39:02.40]I'm having an animator make stuff.
[39:04.48]No, no.
[39:04.78]It needs to be special.
[39:05.85]Yeah, it's got to be like... Glue Man has to come give the double middle finger and then get hit by a car.
[39:12.01]Something you're not going to see all the time.
[39:13.62]By a car.
[39:14.68]Yeah, he's going to come out and throw his cape off and give the double middle finger and then get run over by a train.
[39:20.54]Are you going to do some special filming just for that?
[39:25.09]Or is it going to be animated Glue Man?
[39:26.63]Like animated, but actually it would be kind of funny.
[39:28.19]What if it was real?
[39:30.07]Get the guy that I had that'd be Glue Man in front of a green screen.
[39:32.97]Get real Glue Man.
[39:34.05]That's actually a very good idea.
[39:36.13]He could just be flexing in front of a green screen and pointing for different tiers.
[39:42.14]And you do want to, like, the stuntman, like, rip lines that tears him backward when the car hits him.
[39:48.53]Yeah, I want to just do, like, wild shit.
[39:51.99]And it'll change, like, all the time.
[39:56.42]He gives you the rod.
[39:57.28]Alright, what if you got, like, some green little pads in a green screen, and you just drop Glue Man from, like, ten feet onto the, like, safety pads?
[40:07.43]He just comes in from, like, top of the screen and just splats.
[40:11.91]He just explodes.
[40:13.71]Oh, God.
[40:15.63]Mingfur, I ain't dropping big bits till you make me feel special for it.
[40:21.60]No one's expected to drop anything.
[40:23.86]But, you know, when they do, I'd like it to be something that they can be happy and excited that it happens, you know.
[40:32.68]But thank you nonetheless, Mick.
[40:34.06]And BuilderBro for six months.
[40:35.78]Cuties ahoy.
[40:36.78]It's my boy, Jerma985.
[40:38.23]Boy.
[40:39.53]Cuties ahoy.
[40:41.99]Thanks to Loose Cannon for the sub.
[40:43.29]Welcome, dude.
[40:44.35]Thank you, Ratty.
[40:46.05]For eight months.
[40:46.83]That was an eight-monther, Alex.
[40:49.07]That's almost a year.
[40:51.12]There's been some 12 months already.
[40:55.90]My character is... I hate this character.
[40:58.89]What does he look like?
[41:01.37]It's like a certain character from the show.
[41:03.33]I don't know what show though.
[41:04.73]With those big eyes, big glasses.
[41:07.21]You look like Rick with darker hair.
[41:09.90]Baxter from the Ninja Turtles.
[41:12.02]Oh.
[41:13.66]The lab bug guy.
[41:14.46]What?
[41:18.74]No, I don't.
[41:19.30]I don't know who Baxter is.
[41:20.56]You don't know who Baxter is?
[41:22.91]He's like the lab guy.
[41:24.39]He's like the lab coat.
[41:25.25]He gets turned into a giant fly.
[41:29.23]I remember the giant fly.
[41:30.51]I didn't remember what he looked like.
[41:31.95]The giant fly was the first boss, wasn't he?
[41:34.39]On the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.
[41:37.67]The big apple.
[41:38.73]Big apple.
[41:39.31]Baxter, man.
[41:40.90]Boycott bits until green screen.
[41:43.00]500.
[41:43.02]That's gonna happen soon.
[41:50.04]Thanks, dude.
[41:50.79]Thanks, Weasel.
[41:54.13]Also, I'm outies and your stream still says you're playing Sorcery.
[41:56.43]It does?
[41:57.17]It should be Stardew Valley.
[41:59.91]Stardew Valley for me?
[42:01.51]See you later, Mank.
[42:01.97]Thanks for hanging out for as long as you could.
[42:05.90]You like the guy from Mega Man?
[42:06.92]Yeah.
[42:08.72]Can I actually go in the store now?
[42:09.72]Has it been a long enough time where I can go in?
[42:11.40]What's up, kid?
[42:14.74]Oh, stranger.
[42:15.37]My name's Vincent.
[42:16.27]Mama says not to talk to you, but okay.
[42:22.71]Bury it in his head!
[42:29.29]What's this, a gravestone?
[42:30.41]Destroy it!
[42:32.51]Destroy the gravestones!
[42:37.68]Zap!
[42:41.72]Alright, where's that store?
[42:42.60]I don't know where that store is.
[42:50.15]Hey, Jared, it's me, the Time Serpent from Psychology 101.
[42:54.51]That guy has, that has been repeated at least six times now.
[43:02.14]The Time Serpent from Psychology.
[43:05.08]Hey, what's up?
[43:05.68]Hey, you remember that, remember Fenestra?
[43:10.32]Alright, let's get some beans.
[43:12.90]No, I don't want beans.
[43:15.26]Didn't they, like, do something?
[43:18.38]Didn't they nerf something and buff certain ones?
[43:21.10]Etalyx, propel the patch notes for us.
[43:23.00]Huh?
[43:23.42]What?
[43:23.76]Oh, patch notes.
[43:24.74]Yeah.
[43:25.46]Beep, boop, beep, boop, beep.
[43:27.90]Wait, what?
[43:29.86]Some superstar animator.
[43:31.34]The sound of my computer brain.
[43:33.82]Do, do, do.
[43:34.40]Like, what's the new top tier seed?
[43:41.23]Alright, Stardew Valley.
[43:42.83]Well, thanks for hanging out, Ton Coots.
[43:47.42]Glad you're enjoying yourself.
[43:49.22]Stick with it, buddy.
[43:51.94]Cranberries are always darkest.
[43:54.67]No more coffee pay.
[43:55.87]Uh-oh, Ronnie's here.
[43:56.81]Ronnie's here to stop the fun.
[43:59.57]King Mod is here.
[44:02.79]We have the two King Mods.
[44:06.08]I don't think we have a Queen Mod yet.
[44:08.24]I'm not even sure there's a woman that is a mod.
[44:10.08]Is there any woman in the stream?
[44:12.66]I don't even know.
[44:18.72]Alright, which one is Alex?
[44:19.44]Cauliflower?
[44:19.68]Probably don't answer.
[44:21.66]Cauliflower, you got it.
[44:27.16]I'm looking at the values, but, uh, you know, change log doesn't really tell me too much.
[44:30.77]No, we'll go with seven cauliflowers.
[44:34.07]That works.
[44:41.56]Me!
[44:42.60]Oh, we do have... Get out of the way.
[44:44.80]Oh, we got... Oh, yeah, I blew here, too.
[44:48.12]You're going to love it here in Pelican Town.
[44:51.44]Yeah.
[44:54.66]You and I are a match.
[44:58.48]Have you gotten married yet?
[45:00.17]No, nobody likes me.
[45:01.39]The last time I played this game at 40 hours, nobody liked me.
[45:03.71]I had one friend.
[45:05.39]And then they unfriended me.
[45:08.03]Well, you just gotta go wild and propose first.
[45:11.77]Like, your first conversation, you just propose to everyone.
[45:14.35]Seriously, like, I'm like a cat in a paper bag.
[45:16.95]I don't know where the hell I ever gonna go.
[45:22.18]What's that saying?
[45:23.54]Let the cat out of the bag.
[45:26.18]That is that is saying yes.
[45:27.84]That's what I meant to say.
[45:29.64]No, and that's not what I meant to say.
[45:30.67]I meant to say let the cat inside the bag.
[45:34.19]I out of the bag.
[45:37.09]Well, you can't you can't even get out of brown paper bag.
[45:39.69]Right?
[45:40.96]I can't even punch my way out of a brown, wet paper bag.
[45:44.27]You can't even get a cat to punch its way out of a brown paper bag out of the bag.
[45:47.15]There it is.
[45:49.61]I want to do some fishing.
[45:53.81]I forget how you fish.
[45:55.49]If you put a cat in a bag and throw it in a river, it's probably dead.
[45:59.82]But you would never do something like that.
[46:01.94]Unless it was already dead.
[46:02.98]Otherwise, I would attack you.
[46:04.42]Hit.
[46:06.20]Hit.
[46:12.40]Alright, what's your percentage on, uh, Far Cry 4?
[46:16.14]Um... Complete.
[46:18.06]You're done.
[46:18.40]I still have, like, another few minutes on mine.
[46:21.92]Shnattercat in a bag.
[46:26.13]Ugh, gross algae.
[46:31.91]Beer.
[46:38.04]I need to plant my cauliflower.
[46:39.38]It's gonna be funny, like, I'm playing Stardew Valley, I'm gonna, like, walk around aimlessly for, like, 20 minutes, plant some seeds, and then we're gonna play Far Cry 4.
[46:49.12]I hope you guys liked the Stardew Valley stream.
[46:50.98]Stardew Valley is, like, such a long-term game.
[46:53.83]Yeah, you can't just get, like... It requires commitment.
[46:56.95]You can't just get, like, 20... I at least wanna, like, fight the aliens.
[47:01.29]Well, you gotta stay awake.
[47:02.19]You can't expend all your energy, so you don't, you know, you don't need to sleep.
[47:05.41]I promise there will be one alien fight, because that's what we'll do, because this is not different until it's nighttime, right?
[47:11.30]Yeah.
[47:12.36]Well, then, let's gear ourselves up.
[47:13.64]Your home base is different.
[47:15.10]That lake that you're fishing at was not there before.
[47:18.43]Really?
[47:19.97]There was, like, a tiny baby lake.
[47:22.83]A little tiny baby lake.
[47:32.24]Aliens on day five?
[47:33.40]So, should I just go to bed?
[47:38.25]Oh, you know what?
[47:38.71]You don't have a sword.
[47:39.55]Should I just go to bed ten days in a row?
[47:42.17]How would you even fight?
[47:43.93]I gotta... Okay, look at all these other blunt objects I have.
[47:46.22]I've got, like, a shearing... I got a hewing axe.
[47:49.82]I have a hoe.
[47:51.32]I have a pickaxe.
[47:52.06]I can just... Dude, I got a scythe.
[47:53.46]That'll be fine.
[47:59.47]I wish I could do like the thing you can do in Fallout where you can just sleep for like four hours.
[48:07.65]Ooh, 16 incher.
[48:08.47]Alright, get me out of here.
[48:14.68]Get me the F out of here.
[48:20.88]I'm remembering why I thought this game was fun though.
[48:23.40]It's fun just to kind of walk around and just do random dumb things.
[48:27.73]Did you ever play this game?
[48:29.78]Me?
[48:29.98]Yeah.
[48:31.14]Yeah, for like 10 hours or less.
[48:34.40]I wanted to play it more, but they kept talking about like, ooh, co-op is coming sometime soon.
[48:39.48]We have to do that.
[48:39.92]And it turned out soon was like a year.
[48:42.67]I can't wait until you and I can share a farm together.
[48:44.93]Probably going to be like March next year.
[48:46.99]Oh, really?
[48:47.71]Going to be a while.
[48:52.41]Hey, look at that.
[48:52.99]Steam has finished downloading Far Cry 4.
[48:57.57]Now we just got to get that open.
[48:59.66]Now we just gotta hope there's not a 45 minute single player only tutorial.
[49:03.90]Now we just have to- I'm gonna have like two windows open.
[49:05.91]One's gonna be Far Cry, one's gonna be Stardew.
[49:07.35]I'm gonna play them at the same time.
[49:10.23]Make sure you get some Minesweeper in there too.
[49:13.47]I was just aimlessly making fucking- This is why I can't play this game.
[49:18.92]I would just like- My brain turns the fuck off and I just start doing something and I don't stop till my thought I was currently on is done.
[49:30.37]Look at this miserable catastrophe of a farm.
[49:34.31]Those fucking aliens are gonna get it, man.
[49:40.46]Alright, 4.30.
[49:41.00]When do they show up?
[49:41.52]5?
[49:41.54]5 p.m.?
[49:42.16]Is there, like, a fast-forward button?
[49:48.02]I don't think so.
[49:48.48]Yeah, it's getting the... It's getting bed.
[49:52.11]I wanna keep my energy.
[49:53.09]Can you hear the rain?
[49:54.29]It's raining hard right now.
[49:56.73]Maybe we'll get some, like, cool thunder and lightning.
[50:02.85]Please use the pickaxe and fix the nubs.
[50:08.39]Alright, fine.
[50:09.65]Alright.
[50:10.47]I'll fix the nubs.
[50:13.89]The OCD in the audience.
[50:16.69]Oh, I know.
[50:18.60]Trust me, I know.
[50:23.48]530?
[50:24.76]Come on, bring it on.
[50:26.24]Got bad news.
[50:27.44]Bad news?
[50:28.00]Looks like the cutscene for Far Cry 4 is unskippable at the beginning.
[50:33.60]So, we'll just... It's six minutes.
[50:36.48]It's a six-minute cutscene?
[50:38.34]No, I don't know, but it's still going.
[50:40.08]It's been going for at least two or three minutes.
[50:42.14]Hold on a second.
[50:44.20]I'm going to open up Far Cry 4.
[50:47.76]I'm going to do the opening cutscene to Far Cry 4 while Stardew Valley is on the screen.
[50:53.57]Actually, this might be fun.
[50:54.29]And just have it play in the background?
[50:56.09]Yeah, hold on a second.
[50:58.27]Give me one second, guys.
[51:01.41]One second.
[51:02.29]I'm gonna mute everything.
[51:04.97]Well, except for myself.
[51:11.16]Fucking Uplay.
[51:12.18]Don't even tell me I have to... No!
[51:15.04]No, not Uplay.
[51:16.86]No.
[51:17.22]Oh, God.
[51:20.25]I would rather seriously saw both my hands off than do this.
[51:23.73]I have no idea what my Uplay account is.
[51:26.09]I don't have any clue.
[51:26.85]I'm gonna have to guess.
[51:30.47]Oh my god.
[51:34.29]What a fucking crock of shit.
[51:36.39]I have no idea what my password is.
[51:37.81]I don't have a single clue.
[51:51.14]That's not right.
[51:53.10]Neither is that.
[51:58.28]Neither is that.
[52:00.06]Okay, hold on.
[52:01.08]Let me recover my password for fucking Ubisoft.
[52:06.66]This is gonna be worth it, guys.
[52:08.18]Trust me.
[52:10.23]Forgot your password?
[52:11.31]I don't even know what my email is.
[52:13.91]What email did I sign up with?
[52:18.59]I don't know.
[52:23.09]This is such a pain in the ass.
[52:26.26]Hold on.
[52:30.03]Getting some tea.
[52:33.75]Let me just recover my Ubisoft password real quick.
[52:36.13]Don't worry.
[52:45.14]Old man Jerma forgetting everything.
[52:46.86]No, it's not that.
[52:47.50]I just haven't logged into Uplay in probably a year.
[52:51.02]And every time I log into Uplay, I do this.
[52:53.48]Because I don't remember.
[52:55.90]Sapdim?
[53:03.60]Seriously, I'm gonna make my Ubisoft password like 12345.
[53:06.20]I don't even fucking care.
[53:10.24]Like I don't even fucking care.
[53:11.70]It's gonna be 123456.
[53:12.88]Yeah, if you hack me, there you go.
[53:23.55]You can play like Far Cry 4.
[53:34.84]RIP account.
[53:58.55]I don't even know my password to the email that is associated with this account.
[54:04.38]Oh my god.
[54:05.42]Honestly, you know what I'm looking forward to?
[54:06.90]I look forward to this.
[54:08.36]I can't wait till we have a fucking chip implanted in our hands.
[54:11.38]You know what I mean?
[54:14.15]Like, when you're a baby, they like implant a fucking chip, a CPU in your finger.
[54:23.81]I can't wait for that.

[54:34.04]Done.
[54:38.80]Can't wait.
[54:41.31]And then there's some studies gonna come out.
[54:43.35]Oh, those studies revealed that having the chip implanted into your finger, you lose 10 years on your life.
[54:48.81]Good.
[54:48.97]I don't care.
[54:50.27]I'd rather lose 10 years of my life than have to log into, like, Gmail incorrectly three times in a row.
[54:59.71]Well, what first world problems that I just described.
[55:06.96]Yeah.
[55:18.61]form growths not quite there we're getting there hold on god this is I blame this all on you play all of it every second of this is blamed on you play

[55:53.13]What a fucking crock of dog shit.
[55:57.71]Yeah.
[55:58.99]It's fucking stupid.
[56:06.06]Alright.

[56:15.17]See if I can get into my account.
[56:18.91]Don't worry, guys.
[56:19.47]It's his first time streaming.
[56:22.30]Well, good.
[56:23.16]Once this is all said and done, it'll be worth it.
[56:25.38]It's okay.
[56:30.32]I'm not concerned about it.
[56:35.79]Everything's gonna be fine.
[56:37.61]Don't worry.
[56:37.95]I have everything under control, guys.
[56:39.19]I will have everything under control.

[62:01.59]It's too late to try this.
[62:02.63]It's starting soon.
[62:05.03]Yeah, the game is abhorrently loud.
[62:15.89]Yeah.
[62:17.60]Oh my god, where the fuck is the audio options?
[62:28.62]Okay, now people can hear you now.
[62:31.50]I fucking hate video games.
[62:34.74]Hey guys, uh, hello.
[62:37.77]Well, um, this has been Jerma Rages at Uplay.
[62:41.67]Stay tuned.
[62:44.57]Stardew Valley is still open somewhere.
[62:46.95]My computer is broken.
[62:52.52]Yeah, I guess Stardew Valley is just playing in the background.
[62:54.42]I don't know where it is.
[62:57.14]I'm probably like dead in Stardew Valley.
[63:00.24]I hate video games.
[63:01.52]I fucking hate video game companies.
[63:04.69]Why can't we all adhere to the same, like, why isn't there, like, an F, like, a federal video, F-V-G-C, like, federal video game communications?
[63:13.16]Anyways, the bits you missed, Aeronar, Aeronorth gave you, like, 12,300 bits.
[63:20.89]Okay.
[63:21.51]And he said, this is not worth it.
[63:25.35]start online creating your online session encounter okay don't care I thank you aeronorth on behalf of Jerma lord hold on he's very distracted right now I am just so angry right now let me see who uh I can't thank you for sticking around my computer like just broke three times during the process of this because I started valley was still open but let me let me change the stream title
[63:59.28]My lord.
[63:59.92]I didn't even do the title.
[64:08.14]I fucked up the title.
[64:09.16]Far Cry Money with Etalyx added to the money symbol.
[64:11.68]I don't even care.
[64:12.64]You team YouTube money.
[64:14.10]Far Cry Money with Etalyx.
[64:18.64]Oh my god.
[64:21.18]Jesus.
[64:25.10]Well, that was painful.
[64:28.05]You know what else is painful?
[64:29.05]This FOV.
[64:30.49]Is it?
[64:33.90]Well, Ubisoft presents.
[64:36.14]Hang on.
[64:37.90]There is a setting, because this is a PC game.
[64:40.00]Alright, let me say thank you to these people.
[64:44.33]Dude, thanks for the $123.
[64:45.01]$12,345.
[64:45.03]That's $123, dude.
[64:45.59]That's more than I could fucking ever possibly ask somebody for anything.
[64:48.79]So thanks, dude.
[64:58.85]Names aren't showing anymore.
[64:59.83]I don't know why.
[65:00.83]Yeah, I told you.
[65:01.95]Everything just fucking crashed.
[65:05.05]The whole thing went down.
[65:07.69]Because of Uplay.
[65:08.45]This is all Uplay's fault.
[65:12.79]I just reset it.
[65:15.39]Thanks to PaxtonTV for two months.
[65:17.57]Thanks, DrCheese, for eight months.
[65:20.34]Thanks again, dude.
[65:21.80]Was it Aronorth?
[65:22.56]It was Aronorth, right?
[65:23.48]For a hundred and twee.
[65:24.38]A hundred and twee.
[65:25.05]A hundred and twee, yes.
[65:27.33]I'm all out of sorts right now, guys.
[65:29.21]I'm like, you know when you get really mad and your fucking face turns all red and you like start to... I already told this story.
[65:33.66]Don't tell it again.
[65:36.48]Thank you, though, very much, man.
[65:37.80]It's much appreciated.
[65:39.76]And I had some more resubs, too.
[65:41.36]Don't worry, guys.
[65:41.86]This is the first time streaming.
[65:42.88]Thanks for the 500, dude.
[65:44.17]There is no sound.
[65:45.09]Something else broke.
[65:46.89]Thank you, ShoopDaFloop, for your subscription.
[65:49.21]Shplargy for your sub.
[65:51.73]Weasel for 500 bits.
[65:52.37]Thanks a lot, dude.
[65:54.27]RubyR for eight months.
[65:55.41]You play strikes again.
[65:56.31]Yeah, again and again and again.
[65:59.08]Mr. Epic, thanks for the sub.
[66:01.02]BossCodBear, thanks for seven months, dude.
[66:02.85]He's been a little happy clown face.
[66:04.25]I appreciate that clown face.
[66:06.81]And, yeah, that should be up to date.
[66:07.97]Now, we don't have audio, so that's a problem.
[66:10.11]Yeah.
[66:12.31]No, we do have audio.
[66:12.95]It's just wicked low.
[66:15.41]And then, thanks, BootScootBoog.
[66:22.24]What is, like, what?
[66:23.52]This is, like, just a mime cutscene.
[66:25.66]Oh, he shot at us!
[66:29.41]I think I can turn this up now.
[66:39.77]I can't even open up my volume controls.
[66:41.87]Everything is fucked.
[66:45.86]Uplay has taken over my entire computer.
[66:48.42]I wish that was a joke.
[66:56.40]I fucking just minimize it.
[66:57.38]I don't even care.
[67:09.25]I'll help you guys.
[67:10.21]If you can't understand the story, I'll help you.
[67:13.03]It's too bad that you're here.
[67:15.13]You come into my capital looking for some... thing.
[67:20.68]You fucked up big time.
[67:22.50]You were supposed to shoot the guy in the window.
[67:25.56]And you didn't do it.
[67:26.94]So let me tell you one thing.
[67:28.94]Do you feel lucky this afternoon, my friend of mine?
[67:33.15]I wouldn't feel lucky if I were you.
[67:35.21]Don't ever...
[67:37.21]screw this up again, or I tell you right now, your world will turn upside down.
[67:44.20]Don't worry, everything's going to be real fine.
[67:47.42]Have you seen my knife?
[67:48.94]I just bought it on eBay.
[67:50.90]Yes!
[67:51.80]Yes!
[67:52.28]Yes!
[67:52.74]Yes!
[67:53.26]Yes!
[67:53.76]Yes!
[67:54.30]Yes!
[67:58.02]Oh, now I'm a little tired.
[68:02.35]I just wish he knew that I bought that on eBay.
[68:08.78]Oh, yeah, I can't wait.
[68:14.10]The fire behind me is very warm and enticing.
[68:17.44]Let me help you up here, friend.
[68:19.90]Now, it's excreted portion.
[68:25.04]What are the words that you're saying?
[68:29.31]It's hard to do this.
[68:30.55]I thought you were reading subtitles at first, and then I realized no.
[68:33.99]No, no.
[68:38.24]Reading subtitles.
[68:44.21]Ah.
[68:46.35]Man.
[68:47.99]What did you do?
[68:48.49]Do you have a problem with this?
[68:49.57]I can't even fucking do it, dude.
[68:54.79]Excrease.
[68:56.05]Excrease.
[68:58.53]No, I didn't do anything.
[69:00.69]Yeah, take him away.
[69:01.46]Take him to the dogs!
[69:02.84]And I'll tell you one more thing.
[69:04.52]One more very important thing.
[69:05.64]This knife.
[69:06.52]It's not even a knife.
[69:07.28]It's a pen.
[69:07.82]Gotcha.
[69:08.96]Tricked ya.
[69:10.16]This, though.
[69:10.54]Let's take a selfie quick together.
[69:12.39]Smile.
[69:13.59]Ooh, yeah.
[69:14.35]That's a good one.
[69:16.37]I don't particularly... Oh, no.
[69:18.51]I didn't make a reaction yet.
[69:19.83]Oh, wow.
[69:20.13]That fire really blew up in my face.
[69:21.54]God, get it out of here.
[69:22.40]Smoky and gross.
[69:24.38]Did I ever tell you that if you wait here for 15 minutes, you and I can have a good lunch and the game will end?
[69:30.40]And I probably shouldn't have said that out loud.
[69:31.98]Yeah, I'm really excited.
[69:32.87]Yes!
[69:33.53]Alright, let's go.
[69:34.47]Far Cry 4.
[69:39.23]There's music playing right now.
[69:47.49]Now we have audio.
[69:50.22]Oh, I thought we had audio before.
[69:52.72]No, no, no, we did.
[69:54.00]No, I heard the game audio twice.
[69:55.32]I heard one track coming through my game and then one track coming through TeamSpeak.
[69:59.38]There was just a bunch of people talking.
[70:00.66]I thought I was in a cutscene.
[70:04.54]So how do we play together?
[70:05.84]Uh, I don't know.
[70:07.94]Should I just stay for the fancy lunch ending?
[70:09.62]So are you turning your stream on?
[70:17.00]Once we get in here.
[70:17.82]Uh, getting ready to.
[70:18.48]I'm just trying to, like... This game is so loud, even when I turn it down.
[70:21.85]Trying to get all my audio.
[70:25.51]And you're probably still, like, in the cutscene.
[70:29.95]I'm at the dinner table right now.
[70:32.41]I walked out the front door, because I think it's on rails.
[70:35.83]Up until you get outside.
[70:37.83]Oh my god, this is horrible screen tearing.
[70:40.31]I think I have to turn on, uh...
[70:42.04]Make sure you turn your FOV up in the options.
[70:46.96]Very important.
[70:48.32]Oh, we have to add each other on a friends list.
[70:51.48]I can't wait to do that on Ubisoft.
[70:57.44]You play.
[70:58.58]Your rules.
[70:59.68]Your games.
[71:01.38]Oh, look at that cash.
[71:02.56]Is that Benjamin Franklin?
[71:03.44]Oh, there's Thomas Jefferson.
[71:07.96]Oh, and there's Shaquille O'Neal.
[71:09.00]He's on the fucking 25 now.
[71:14.16]What if, like, Larry Bird was on, like, the $20 bill?
[71:16.66]That'd be awesome.
[71:22.67]Alright, type me your Uplay username.
[71:26.47]Uh, it's just Jermabot.
[71:27.99]Oh.
[71:28.19]Oh.
[71:30.99]Or say it out loud.
[71:32.29]It doesn't matter.
[71:33.25]Dude, I just gave my Ubisoft password on stream.
[71:35.63]Who cares?
[71:35.97]Oh yeah, that's right.
[71:37.25]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[71:37.47]Who gives a shit?
[71:39.59]I sent you a request.
[71:40.82]You better accept me before everyone else sends you a request.
[71:43.68]I don't even know how to do that.
[71:47.05]You're gonna have, like, 50 requests you're gonna have to find Mino.
[71:50.27]Oh, I've been through the Uplay app.
[71:53.81]Get the Uplay app.
[71:54.73]Power to the players.
[71:55.57]Power to the players.
[72:06.62]No, Shift-F1 Origin.
[72:08.98]Another game playing app.
[72:10.57]I don't know.
[72:10.89]Shift-Tab?
[72:11.77]I don't know.
[72:12.63]Well, that's Steam.
[72:13.63]Maybe I can invite you from Steam.
[72:15.57]No, definitely not.
[72:16.43]Shift-F2.
[72:24.14]Shift F1 was taken by Origins, so they had to go with Shift F2.
[72:27.88]I agree with this person.
[72:29.24]Nobody's going to go through Uplay just to friend me.
[72:33.23]Nobody's even going to bother to open the program.
[72:35.41]Shift F2.
[72:35.57]Wow, that person didn't lie to me.
[72:37.79]The Etalyx, right?
[72:39.39]Yes.
[72:39.59]Alright.
[72:39.87]Just making sure.
[72:40.41]Help!
[72:40.53]Help!
[72:40.63]Help!
[72:40.79]Help!
[73:00.81]I'm guessing you're narrating another cutscene.
[73:05.05]They're not coming for me.
[73:06.07]I was hoping he was going to throw him over the edge.
[73:16.39]Because I would just go like... Don't move.
[73:20.26]I will be right back.
[73:22.86]Alright, let me fix my graphic settings.
[73:31.23]We're going to have to do some graphical readjustments.
[73:38.61]Yeah.
[73:38.77]Alright.
[73:39.55]Bear with me.
[73:41.73]We're going to do borderless 1920x1080.
[73:43.65]V-sync on just because I'm getting a lot of screen tearing.
[73:47.21]Ooh, V-sync on.
[73:49.32]Ah, yeah.
[73:50.14]Okay, triple buffering.
[73:51.54]I don't care.
[73:53.76]Field of view scaling.
[73:56.52]I don't even know what that means.
[73:57.55]I wish there was a number on it.
[74:02.51]I just kind of went with max, but it might be... Hard to tell, really.
[74:14.86]I might have to turn V-Sync off.
[74:16.48]I can't stand this.
[74:19.50]There's like a quarter of a second input delay.
[74:24.16]It's called U-Sync.
[74:27.54]That's a pretty game.
[74:32.19]What the fuck?
[74:33.41]What the fuck was that?
[74:34.75]Alright, how's the audio?
[74:35.85]Can you guys hear it?
[74:36.39]Should I turn it down?
[74:36.89]Turn it up?
[74:37.71]How's the talons over the audio?
[74:39.83]Hey guys, what's going on?
[74:41.01]My name is Bop.
[74:42.21]Not gonna lie, I swear to God, I thought that was a bits notification on the screen.
[74:46.73]What?
[74:47.59]I picked up, like, money on the ground and popped it up on the screen.
[74:50.28]I thought it was somebody donating 1,600 bits.
[75:02.99]It's called You Suck.
[75:10.97]Do you want me to do the dinner ending?
[75:14.11]I think I have to do the cutscene again.
[75:16.45]If I do the dinner ending.
[75:25.42]That's probably better.
[75:26.04]Alright.
[75:36.12]Thank you.
[75:38.29]Thank you, BananaMan244.
[75:38.99]Stayed in there for the dinner ending.
[75:41.67]Thanks, Phoenix Reignition.
[75:45.55]Phoenix Reignition again.
[75:47.21]Dr. Cheese.
[75:48.61]I'm pro-nation.
[75:50.34]For the 500 bits.
[75:53.08]Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream with 250 bits.
[75:55.16]Thanks a lot, dude.
[75:57.82]And Dr. Cheese again.
[75:58.78]Thanks a lot, guys.
[76:02.04]Well, I kind of have to sit here for 15 minutes because the talics, like, we're, like, trying to, like, work together.
[76:06.78]Wait a minute.
[76:07.68]No, I'm ahead of you.
[76:08.64]I'm outside.
[76:09.24]Oh, you left?
[76:10.36]Yeah, I told you.
[76:11.07]That's what I told you.
[76:12.17]You're like, I'm at the dinner table.
[76:13.45]I was like, well, yeah, you gotta go outside.
[76:15.21]I thought you were going to, like, turn your stream on.
[76:16.61]I'm like, we're waiting for you to do that.
[76:18.89]I'm sorry.
[76:19.35]I didn't know you were waiting on me.
[76:20.85]It's all good.
[76:21.13]It's all good.
[76:21.41]I'm coming.
[76:21.63]I'm coming.
[76:21.89]I'm coming.
[76:22.13]Let me just, like, punch the punching bags.
[76:23.63]Because there's still, like, another little on rails bit you got to do.
[76:27.44]How do I get out of here?
[76:28.92]Go downstairs.
[76:30.52]Jump through the window.
[76:31.28]Got it.
[76:33.35]That didn't work.
[76:33.75]Alright, I'm pushing the detonation button.
[76:38.57]Jumper cables and 10,000 bits.
[76:44.03]I'll make sure to mute myself when I'm talking to people.
[76:46.95]Okay.
[76:47.65]Well, we should be seeing if this works.
[76:50.01]This is going to be my test.
[76:54.58]I'm not staying for the dinner table.
[76:57.36]Whoa, what are they doing?
[76:58.36]What are they doing to him?
[77:01.77]Let's rewind for a bit, because I want to make sure that you know exactly what I want.
[77:08.19]That guy's a bad guy.
[77:09.07]I don't care.
[77:10.50]Do you know why you are here?
[77:14.18]Ajigale.
[77:15.34]My name is Sabal.
[77:20.87]Probably turn on subtitles, certainly.
[77:23.08]That probably will help.
[77:30.58]Lunch!
[77:31.18]Lunch, Jerry!
[77:34.34]They're making him install Uplay.
[77:41.76]No, I don't wanna!
[77:42.40]I don't wanna install Uplay to play this game!
[77:44.38]I don't wanna waste 25 fucking minutes troubleshooting problems!
[77:54.72]Wasted bits!
[77:55.50]Do it for daddy!
[77:56.98]Dr. Cheese, uh, I love you, dude.
[77:58.68]Okay, I'm unmuted.
[78:03.45]Are you at the runny part?
[78:04.93]Uh, am I unmuted?
[78:06.79]Yeah.
[78:07.73]Hi.
[78:08.37]Hi.
[78:08.83]Hi!
[78:09.05]Alright, I'm at the runny part.
[78:11.95]But, hold on a second, I need to turn this down again.
[78:13.85]Actually, I can do this.
[78:22.73]Alright.
[78:22.95]I'm going to stop dying over and over again here.
[78:26.17]Oh, you're dying in there?
[78:28.01]Well, I've just been like configuring settings and stuff.
[78:30.51]And when you're supposed to run, if you just stand still, you die.
[78:39.25]But if you run, you miraculously dodge every bullet.
[78:42.13]Okay.
[78:43.56]Running.
[78:50.02]I wanted to pick up the gun.
[78:57.03]Running.
[79:07.78]What?
[79:08.30]Why am I dead?
[79:08.98]I thought you said if you keep running, you don't die.
[79:15.74]I didn't die.
[79:16.30]How did I die?
[79:17.50]That is a good question.
[79:24.11]I just ran all the way through and it was fine.
[79:27.44]Running!
[79:29.00]Cutscreening!
[79:30.54]Running!
[79:33.58]Oh, I can see where the little explosions are.
[79:35.23]That's how you have to dodge it.
[79:38.57]I didn't even go in the car.
[79:39.45]That was the problem.
[79:40.57]Get us out of here!
[79:43.03]Wow.
[79:51.17]This guy doesn't seem very... into it.
[79:56.88]Uh, what?
[79:58.44]You're like the guy you're riding with.
[80:05.63]So how do we like join each other after this?
[80:09.27]Do you know?
[80:09.91]I don't know.
[80:10.47]I never played this game before.
[80:12.10]It was my first time.
[80:14.40]I hope there wasn't a 45 minute introductory tutorial mission.
[80:22.04]I just got shot a bunch of times.
[80:23.09]Let me wrap up my wrist.
[80:40.15]Quick, wrap your wrist up.
[80:41.43]Oh!
[80:43.97]That scared the shit out of me, for real.
[80:49.94]I think... What, did you get rammed?
[80:55.68]I think after you get rammed, I think we can do stuff, maybe.
[80:59.16]That scared the hell out of me.
[81:00.14]Oh.
[81:12.25]That guy looks dead.
[81:16.53]Let me track his cell phone data.
[81:23.02]The Uber driver sucks.
[81:25.18]Wow, the Uber driver had like a giant machete too, for some reason.
[81:33.74]I know.
[81:34.38]That's what I've got now.
[81:35.40]And it told me how to be stealthy.
[81:37.18]And I'm just gonna run out here and die.
[81:38.74]You actually cannot left click attack.
[81:41.85]so don't make my mistake you have to you can only use that like while in stealth seems like really I try just charging straight ahead okay the detection meter fills up yeah like Metal Gear Solid three yep press t to throw a rock oh my god you can throw rocks in this game you know what else you can do what can you do turn on co-op friendly fire oh my god oh my god oh my god I'm gonna throw a rock at this guy's head I can't wait to hit him right in the head I want to throw a rock at you
[82:21.92]Come on!
[82:22.46]None of those rocks hit him?
[82:28.66]Well, there's one guy.
[82:33.86]When do we get to the friend part?
[82:35.89]I don't know.
[82:39.99]I need to hit this guy right in the face with a rock.
[82:41.93]It's so important.
[82:46.45]Yeah, I know.
[82:47.05]You throw a rock.
[82:48.47]Yep.
[82:49.01]You throw a rock.
[82:59.86]What's that over there?
[83:01.08]Did a Little Rock distract them mid-firefight, I wonder?
[83:06.93]Like they're shooting at you with a gun.
[83:08.81]Oh, a rock.
[83:09.67]A rock just fell next to me.
[83:10.61]I better turn and investigate.
[83:14.61]This is not going well.
[83:18.58]How did I kill him?
[83:19.66]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[83:23.72]Wait, wait.
[83:24.66]It's important.
[83:27.49]Look at the stick in my arm.
[83:29.51]Those rocks just come straight down.
[83:41.40]Can I just run by?
[83:46.20]Alright, no more fucking around.
[83:47.40]I'm not gonna rock this guy.
[83:49.24]Fucking look over there!
[83:51.59]What's with these rocks?
[83:52.19]These rocks don't do anything!
[83:57.85]Come on!
[83:58.17]It'll be okay!
[84:15.70]excuse me don't worry about me how dumb are these guys these guys smart uh have you killed one guy yet no I've been trying to do rock experiments oh well if you kill one guy they drop a rifle oh you only have to actually sneak attack once
[84:47.04]This guy's in the woods throwing rocks at them Luckily they're all wearing red or else I'd be really confused best camouflage cover What There's no fucking way I threw like three rocks over there what why is he running away?
[85:17.26]Heal!
[85:17.74]Heal!
[85:18.24]Heal!
[85:20.74]Have you killed one guy yet?
[85:22.23]Got him.
[85:23.35]Okay.
[85:24.39]Good.
[85:26.93]Where's his rifle?
[85:30.93]Watch out over there!
[85:33.03]He just threw a grenade at me.
[85:36.54]How come they have grenades and I have rocks?
[85:55.04]I have like shrapnel in my hand.
[85:57.74]Give me the gun!
[85:59.70]Give me the gun.
[86:01.74]Okay, honest to god, I'm like burning myself pulling shrapnel out of my hands.
[86:07.21]I just like groped him.
[86:08.69]Give me the fucking gun!
[86:11.43]What the fuck?
[86:14.17]I just like grabbed my hands all around him.
[86:16.19]I didn't like even touch his gun.
[86:22.90]Okay, let me, like, get his gun.
[86:23.86]I'm just gonna, like, smear my hands all around his body.
[86:26.97]All the way.
[86:27.35]Can I get his gun?
[86:28.01]Let me just smear my fingers around like clay.
[86:38.51]I forgot I was muted.
[86:39.57]Hi.
[86:39.85]Alright, I'm almost out of the tutorial zone.
[86:43.93]I think I am, too.
[86:46.27]Been running out of ammo.
[86:51.65]I need, like, ammo, too.
[86:56.22]I'm just gonna grab him and throw over here.
[87:05.27]Okay, am I insane or do you have to be like oddly specifically right in front of something?
[87:08.87]Or can I not?
[87:09.39]Does ammo not exist?
[87:11.45]Uh, you just walk over it.
[87:12.93]You don't have to pick it.
[87:13.83]You don't have to like push a button to pick it up.
[87:15.77]That's weird.
[87:17.09]You just... If you have the gun, you just run over another guy's corpse and it's like, you found 15 rounds of ammunition.
[87:25.20]Oh, okay.
[87:30.49]Now I'm practicing my inner nature photographer.
[87:37.10]Is it what I'm supposed to do, release the cat, release the beast?
[87:44.48]Headshot.
[87:55.25]Oh no, that guy's clean.
[87:58.49]I love that that's the search feature.
[87:59.75]You just pat your hands around his body.
[88:02.17]Yeah, of course.
[88:03.55]You gotta feel him up.
[88:04.95]Make sure he's not hiding anything, you know?
[88:07.33]Yeah, you like frisk the guy.
[88:10.56]It's like a half-assed frisk, though.
[88:11.68]The main character was a former TSA agent.
[88:19.04]Okay, you get bait.
[88:27.32]Those are for when you're hunting and stuff.
[88:29.20]Okay.
[88:34.90]Am I going to get attacked by a leopard right now?
[88:47.57]Welcome to Red Dead Redemption.
[88:56.09]It's a grenade button.
[88:58.74]Oh, that's the kick button.
[89:02.02]I'll find it.
[89:03.18]Actually, I'm going to find some keys here.
[89:12.81]Customize controls.
[89:13.65]There it is.
[89:20.45]Throw.
[89:20.89]Throw rock.
[89:23.75]Melee.
[89:24.85]That one.
[89:34.41]I don't think I even need to fight these guys.
[89:44.31]Well, I probably should, right?
[90:07.48]Ugh, I feel like bones in me.
[90:11.62]Alright.
[90:18.64]Throw bait at them?
[90:19.34]No, I'm saving it.
[90:27.25]I think I got like half health right now.
[90:44.11]I love how oddly specific that just was.
[90:47.79]Throwing knives, nice.
[90:48.67]You can tag shit in this game too.
[90:57.36]That's cool.
[91:01.92]Now this reminds me of Metal Gear Solid V. Alright.
[91:24.23]So, can I throw the bait up there?
[91:25.47]Will that, like, detract him?
[91:28.32]Can I, like, break that down?
[91:29.22]No, he's like, okay, never mind.
[91:41.20]Right in his head.
[91:49.15]Get up there!
[91:52.63]Hey, are we still enjoying the tutorial mission?
[91:55.63]Yeah, we're still in the tutorial.
[91:57.37]Yeah, me too.
[91:58.31]I closed off goofing around.
[92:00.14]I want to get through it.
[92:01.82]Yes, I have ceased the goofs.
[92:05.16]I'm just going.
[92:05.76]How close are you to the bell tower?
[92:11.32]Fairly close.
[92:11.88]I'm just going to run by this.
[92:12.72]I don't even care.
[92:22.81]I'm fairly close now.
[92:24.17]Only 350 meters away.
[92:25.15]I think they called in, like, an airstrike or something.
[92:33.19]Whatever the hell they did.
[92:37.26]Good thing you can do that, because I would have just gotten killed.
[92:40.72]This used to be a goof stream.
[92:52.90]Don't worry.
[92:53.32]It will be a goof stream.
[92:54.30]Don't worry.
[92:54.90]I remember the good old days.
[92:56.46]Does anyone else remember when this was a goof stream?
[92:59.40]It'll be fucking around.
[93:00.80]Don't worry.
[93:01.34]Jump on the avalanche.
[93:07.32]I wonder if we can actually play co-op right now.
[93:09.30]We're just not doing it.
[93:11.74]I don't know.
[93:13.16]Let's just be safe and get through the tutorial so then we can be in the area.
[93:16.62]The hub area.
[93:17.14]Whatever the hell it is.
[93:23.10]I hear somebody screaming.
[93:27.27]Use the rope.
[93:30.89]Sure.
[93:31.19]I miss those goof streams.
[93:40.51]Seems kind of dangerous.
[93:47.22]Did you talk to the tutorial woman?
[94:01.17]It's a very pretty game, that's for sure.
[94:11.55]You guys thought I was gonna jump off, didn't you?
[94:15.09]I kind of wanted to see what happens.
[94:22.73]Free stuff.
[94:23.15]Ten arrows.
[94:23.75]I got a lot of stuff in here.
[94:27.16]Am I muted right now or not?
[94:51.32]Not anymore.
[94:52.62]Oh, now I'm not.
[94:53.24]Okay.
[94:53.82]Now you're not.
[94:54.52]I'm in the bell tower.
[94:56.10]Ah, me too.
[94:56.46]I'm defending the bell tower.
[94:57.74]Same here.
[94:59.86]I'm shooting the guys in the red face mask.
[95:07.44]Me too.
[95:11.80]I feel like the snow is making the stream bitrate extremely low.
[95:17.99]That guy's already dead, but it looks like he's making cover.
[95:23.67]I'll try the other weapons.
[95:24.81]Do I have another weapon?
[95:36.43]Defend.
[95:38.89]Wait till you see what happens next.
[95:41.15]Never expected.
[95:43.05]Spoilers, man.
[95:44.93]You'll never see it coming.
[95:47.77]This girl comes up and she's like.
[95:51.03]Are you driving 985?
[95:53.23]Did that actually happen?
[95:58.70]I matched you on Tinder a long time ago, but I never got a response.
[96:04.00]I could have changed the sensitivity from when you zoomed in.
[96:11.28]I hate when games change your sensitivity when you zoom in.
[96:14.69]Pretty much every shooter does that now.
[96:19.39]Okay, I just got taken over by like the Stephen King's Mist.
[96:25.53]Yeah, the mist.
[96:32.41]Then can we play?
[96:35.47]Let me see if I can skip this cutscene.
[96:39.59]I can't.
[96:39.89]Is there like an option?
[96:41.17]You can?
[96:41.57]No, I can't.
[96:43.65]Oh.
[96:45.43]Me neither.
[96:47.22]Is that you?
[96:49.19]That's a good thing.
[96:49.89]Wait, what?
[96:50.57]It's just like you right here.
[96:53.43]The guy like standing next to you, like talking over your shoulder.
[97:01.59]Alright.
[97:02.53]Prologue complete.
[97:17.88]Oh, he's got a scar on his chin.
[97:18.97]How do you think he got that?
[97:23.59]Uh, he fell down.
[97:24.25]He probably, like, you know, he probably, like, tripped playing flag football.
[97:28.75]Hold on a second.
[97:31.78]He cares about cutscenes.
[97:33.46]Oh, he's got a scar on his left eyebrow, too.
[97:41.16]Here's the new cutscene.
[97:43.79]Mm-hmm.
[97:45.17]The new one?
[97:46.11]Yeah.
[98:08.83]Doesn't even matter what they're saying.
[98:10.53]I don't even know.
[98:15.34]Wait, what?
[98:18.08]I like fish or carrots.
[98:19.08]I love fish and carrots, both of them.
[98:21.50]I feel like I'm in the open world now.
[98:25.78]I feel like this should be the friend zone, you know?
[98:29.04]Alright, toss me an e-vite.
[98:31.68]Co-op unavailable.
[98:32.74]Are you serious?
[98:33.88]Go ahead and clear your head.
[98:35.57]It looks like it's going to be a Stardew Valley stream.
[98:37.49]It's going to be an awful stream.
[98:41.93]We can't play co-op right now?
[98:44.11]It says, and I quote, access to co-op is not yet available.
[98:47.83]Complete more campaign missions to unlock co-op.
[98:50.36]God.
[98:51.62]Alright.
[98:52.82]So just speed run it.
[98:59.04]It would be a lot easier to speed run if you could skip cut scenes, wouldn't it?
[99:03.90]Yeah, it would.
[99:06.52]I went to A, the letter A. You went to the letter A?
[99:11.62]This looks like a side quest.
[99:15.14]Yeah, what's like the actual story missions?
[99:19.02]No, that's campaign.
[99:20.08]A is campaign.
[99:21.30]Okay.
[99:22.04]I'm actually going to Google how many Far Cry 4 missions you have to do.
[99:27.33]Thanks a lot, Sleepy Purple.
[99:32.93]And Copyright TM, thanks for seven months.
[99:36.72]Thank you Never Trust Purple again for all of your bits.
[99:43.41]Yes, this is Far Cry 4.
[99:46.37]Support.
[99:47.49]Well, thank you to VX.
[99:48.61]How to play co-op in Far Cry 4.
[99:51.67]Somebody just gave me a link to a support ticket thing for Ubisoft on how to play co-op.
[99:57.54]Let's click it.
[99:58.16]Let's see.
[100:01.46]Let's open up our Ubisoft support website.
[100:14.10]Uh, it says you need to do a mission with a guy named Herc.
[100:17.83]We have to beat Act 1, by the way.
[100:21.93]Uh, really?
[100:23.09]I would like to play co-op.
[100:23.83]How can I do this?
[100:24.55]Once you progress past Act 1, there will be an H. Alright, Act 1.
[100:32.24]Oh my gosh, are we actually doing this?
[100:35.06]I mean, I'm already in the game.
[100:38.32]Oh my gosh.
[100:39.20]Look, we're fake co-oping right now.
[100:44.28]How do you do only the missions that can take you to whatever?
[100:48.62]We're doing A. We're doing the letter A. Just go to letter A. I can't believe this.
[100:52.88]I can't believe I was lied to.
[100:54.62]I was told it was campaign co-op.
[100:57.78]I'm in the campaign right now.
[101:01.36]I didn't buy anything.
[101:02.40]I'm going to try to finish these missions.
[101:03.82]I'm going to get to act one with no skill points and no money.
[101:06.80]Correct.
[101:11.35]Back to Stardew.
[101:17.04]I wanna, like, ride vehicles and, like, snipe things, you know?
[101:19.90]And co-op with somebody, like, on my six.
[101:23.24]I know, I know.
[101:23.78]I feel like I was lied to.
[101:27.82]Yeah, where's my weapon?
[101:32.15]I have a bow and arrow now.
[101:34.77]There's a Jeep.
[101:36.09]I'm stealing the Jeep.
[101:36.79]Is this, like, GTA?
[101:45.24]Handbrake, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[101:47.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah, shoot, I know.
[101:50.55]Auto drive?
[101:51.21]That's kind of cool.
[102:01.63]What the hell are you doing?
[102:04.64]Hold on, I'll fix it, excuse me.
[102:06.04]You have a mission for me, lady?
[102:09.54]Yeah, I'm looking for the mission.
[102:13.59]Are you talking to this old drinking lady, too?
[102:16.07]Yeah.
[102:17.49]Gosh.
[102:19.69]Oh, fuck.
[102:20.25]I'm all the way back here.
[102:21.39]I just want to kick the drink out of her hand.
[102:27.22]My kick key is not working.
[102:28.64]Alright, remember, we're going to go, go, go, go, go.
[102:37.74]Some kind of wild animal problem?
[102:41.48]What's with that guy talking?
[102:43.44]Says you might have some kind of wild animal problem.
[102:46.46]I have no idea what I'm supposed to do here.
[102:50.95]Wounds are a common nuisance for Canaan's farm.
[102:52.95]No, major goofs.
[102:55.61]There they are.
[102:56.03]There are the goofs.
[102:57.55]And I'm worried about her.
[102:59.39]There's a den nearby.
[103:00.87]That is a never-ending bottle, by the way.
[103:02.38]I think Canaan has supplies stockpiled somewhere on her farm that you can use.
[103:06.34]And I'll take...
[103:09.35]This lady has drank like five bottles worth of one bottle.
[103:14.19]Don't shoot.
[103:25.44]No, fuck.
[103:35.51]God damn it.
[103:36.51]Amita sent me over.
[103:37.77]She said you might have...
[103:40.66]I don't want to do this again.
[103:45.01]I don't want to do it again.
[103:48.57]Push the wheelbarrow under her.
[103:49.65]Hold on.
[103:50.09]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[103:54.27]Very important.
[103:55.27]Okay, I'm going to use all my strength here.
[104:12.66]Oh, go, go.
[104:13.10]Come on, get in front of it.
[104:17.98]It's not gonna work.
[104:18.54]Let's go.
[104:20.16]Alright, am I muted, Zalx?
[104:24.74]Can you hear me?
[104:26.70]I'm muted.
[104:27.06]Okay, he can't hear me.
[104:27.82]So I'm not, like, fucking up his stream.
[104:37.76]Skin.
[104:38.80]Skin your animals.
[104:39.74]Kill this guy.
[104:40.42]Okay, sure.
[104:42.00]I missed.
[104:42.32]Okay.
[104:44.74]Now I have to skin them for food because I'm a hunter.
[104:50.81]Jeez.
[104:53.67]Even my character's grossed out.
[104:54.81]I don't like that.
[104:58.79]Wait, I missed a jewel.
[105:06.76]Undershits.
[105:07.38]Nice.
[105:14.04]Okay.
[105:14.42]I know I... You press the Z to equip the camera?
[105:21.97]Or does it want me to tag something?
[105:29.37]What's the big deal?
[105:30.05]Oh, that thing.
[105:34.69]Alright.
[105:46.95]Easy game.
[105:51.55]Damn it!
[105:53.37]Is it gonna kill me if I jump in the water?
[105:56.95]No.
[106:02.32]Coward.
[106:08.30]Hanzo main.
[106:09.99]No, I'll be fine.
[106:15.09]Destroy the wolves' den.
[106:18.31]Etalyx is ahead of me.
[106:19.03]I see in your chat that I'm ahead of you.
[106:20.37]It's a race.
[106:21.41]No, I know.
[106:21.83]This is bullshit.
[106:22.49]I'm spending too much time running over the old lady with a truck.
[106:24.77]I'm going to win.
[106:29.21]If I can just get out of the water.
[106:30.69]Alright.
[106:31.17]Three, two, one, mute.
[106:32.90]Yeah.
[106:33.90]Oh, shit.
[106:35.64]Let me just... Alright.
[106:37.72]Anything there?
[106:38.16]No, nothing.
[106:46.22]I don't understand what I'm aiming at here.
[106:55.38]Shit, there's a bird.
[106:57.08]That wild bird's gonna come get me.
[107:02.54]Going for the bird.
[107:03.98]Bird shot.
[107:08.14]Ah, come on.
[107:08.82]Give me a bird shot.
[107:09.74]A moon shot.
[107:12.04]Wasting arrow stuff.
[107:14.71]Don't choke on the leech.
[107:24.03]What a Warcraft quest I have to do here, huh?
[107:33.57]Clear out the den.
[107:34.67]You got it.
[107:38.31]I know how to drive.
[107:38.85]You don't have to tell me three times how to drive the car.
[107:44.92]Clear out the den.
[107:46.82]Can I loot while I'm... Wait.
[107:53.79]Sorry about this.
[107:55.25]Sorry about all this.
[108:05.32]I just want to frisk this guy.
[108:07.40]Now we're driving full on into this cave.
[108:18.25]Going to the wolf's den.
[108:21.03]Find yourself a wolf!
[108:29.62]Clear out the wolves' den.
[108:30.44]Did it.
[108:33.30]Got the wolves.
[108:35.56]Turned into my first quest.
[108:36.58]Suck it.
[108:41.61]Clear out the wolves' den.
[108:44.85]Extremely easy.
[108:50.95]There's more to do.
[108:56.40]He's smiling.
[109:04.26]Explosive arrows?
[109:05.28]Oh, cool.
[109:20.08]Bye.
[109:25.19]Back to town.
[109:31.05]I love the driving.
[109:31.77]It's fun to do this.
[109:41.29]I wonder how long it's gonna take to beat Act 1, that's the question.
[109:44.08]I almost got squashed by that eagle.
[109:59.18]I'm back!
[110:01.14]Don't do it.
[110:02.30]Don't do it!
[110:03.40]Don't do it!
[110:04.64]Don't do it, get off.
[110:06.60]Ugh.
[110:08.49]God, thank goodness.
[110:19.17]Sick tricks.
[110:21.69]Spent a lot of bossy suit for six months.
[110:23.17]Welcome back, dude.
[110:26.47]Act one is like four missions.
[110:27.45]This one won't take long at all.
[110:28.77]As long as my internet holds up.
[110:29.80]I sure hope it does.
[110:30.36]I see a lot of fail fishes in the chat.
[110:33.38]I see a lot of fail fishes in this chat.
[110:41.69]We're gonna have to potentially give out, like, five permanent bans.
[110:46.05]Alright, where are you?
[110:48.18]I'm currently permanently banning my whole chat.
[110:51.84]Getting a lot of failfishes.
[110:53.68]Getting a lot of, like, you suck in quotes.
[110:57.04]In quotes, but you know they really mean it?
[110:58.70]Like, you suck.
[110:59.30]Like, did you guys see me take out the wolves, Dan?
[111:02.27]Didn't think so.
[111:04.43]Uh, did you explode yourself, too?
[111:06.17]No, I didn't.
[111:07.23]Oh, I did.
[111:09.44]Like, I didn't realize how big the explosion was going to be.
[111:12.12]I just insta-died.
[111:15.25]Apparently, there's like four or five missions in Act 1, so it shouldn't take that long.
[111:19.17]I'm heading to Mission 2 right now.
[111:20.99]Me too.
[111:21.21]Alright.
[111:21.95]Check back in in 10 minutes.
[111:23.11]Bye.
[111:23.59]Racing.
[111:24.11]Racing.
[111:29.08]Fast travel is available.
[111:38.65]Go back to WoW?
[111:40.45]Fine, I'll go back to bed.
[111:52.42]What did that do?
[111:53.40]Oh, Jesus.
[111:56.43]How many days did I just sleep?
[111:57.73]I just slept for like six years.
[112:00.27]That was a long sleep.
[112:13.04]Hey.
[112:17.80]Stop goofing.
[112:18.60]I'm not goofing anymore.
[112:24.65]Tox is beating you.
[112:25.41]He won't win, though.
[112:28.01]Yeah, I don't have to ever sleep again.
[112:30.17]He fell.
[112:30.61]Okay, he fell down.
[112:40.08]Voted for co-op games with Etalyx.
[112:52.37]Well, we... Etalyx told me this game was co-op in the campaign.
[112:57.10]He was a liar.
[112:59.30]He was incorrect.
[113:03.50]We have to play through, like, the first four missions.
[113:12.78]Now, where's my car?
[113:17.52]A hang glider?
[113:22.27]What did I do with the car?
[113:28.61]Thanks a lot, boot scoop!
[113:34.05]There's the bell tower.
[113:34.77]What did I do with that Jeep?
[113:37.51]No, there it is.
[113:43.05]Let's go!
[113:45.63]Where's the horn?
[113:46.65]I wanna honk the horn.
[114:09.34]I can do the hand glider, nevermind.
[114:16.38]Oh, yes!
[114:17.14]I'm definitely gonna have fun on this thing.
[114:25.75]Okay, I didn't really know how to drive this.
[114:28.19]Pitch and steer.
[114:28.83]There we go.
[114:31.19]This is awesome.
[114:38.62]I like how long it took you to react to that fall.
[114:40.40]About four seconds of free fall.
[114:42.06]Yeah, well, that's because I was... That scared the shit out of me.
[114:46.21]Okay, it was a success.
[114:50.49]I didn't think that was going to be like a GTA stunt jump.
[114:55.33]Help the rebels?
[115:05.71]Oh, those are the rebels.
[115:06.73]Those are the rebels.
[115:07.72]Those were the rebels.
[115:08.60]I just... It's okay.
[115:11.02]I kind of got in the way a little bit there.
[115:15.42]Why is this guy... Are you serious?
[115:20.92]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[115:23.18]Dude, there's no way.
[115:27.42]Oh my god!
[115:35.53]UGH!
[115:38.05]Hold on a second.
[115:39.91]What the fuck?
[115:48.35]I don't even have- Okay, I still got the wing glider.
[115:54.86]You- Oh, let's get this- You sex.
[116:03.70]We'll just call you chaotic good.
[116:09.42]Turn off aim assist?
[116:10.30]Is that what's on?
[116:11.68]Is that on?
[116:12.36]Please tell me that's on so I can turn it off.
[116:14.92]Is it?
[116:23.38]Something's like not right for me.
[116:32.39]No, that doesn't even exist.
[116:40.31]There we go.
[116:41.13]That's better.
[116:46.25]Crash into the mountain?
[116:47.03]No, I'm currently in a race with Etalyx to get to the co-op mode.
[116:50.01]I'm not slamming into a fucking mountainside.
[116:55.19]I did that on purpose.
[117:02.49]Oh, God.
[117:03.45]You can see me slowly turn the camera.
[117:06.61]What is this?
[117:07.17]What?
[117:10.64]What are you doing?
[117:11.92]What are you doing?
[117:12.70]You don't see me standing in the road?
[117:16.49]You don't see me standing in the road?
[117:19.11]Just run a guy over.
[117:29.47]Okay.
[117:30.97]It's the last fucking time I'm doing this.
[117:40.16]Unbelievable.
[117:40.74]I mean, what am I doing standing in the road?
[117:43.85]What are they doing?
[117:44.51]That person was like, had a newspaper in front of their face.
[117:52.62]Dude was holding up a fucking giant, like, 1980s newspaper.
[117:55.94]What the fuck is going on down there?
[118:02.83]I hear, like, machine gun fire.
[118:07.55]Okay, now be careful, guys, because nobody... People just drive... Okay.
[118:14.37]Be careful on the road.
[118:16.91]Random pedestrians will run into you.
[118:20.62]Okay, watch out.
[118:21.28]Watch out.
[118:21.78]See?
[118:26.12]Fucking idiots.
[118:30.79]Where's my other weapons?
[118:31.59]I don't have any other weapons right now.
[118:41.94]Okay, this is where I gotta help the rebels.
[118:47.17]Pick up the drugs.
[118:53.51]Alright, this is all I had to do.
[119:06.17]Got a handkerchief.
[119:11.06]Climb up the mountain.
[119:18.32]Etalyx already finished the game.
[119:21.74]Can I make that jump?
[119:23.24]I don't think so.
[119:24.36]Can I?
[119:24.66]No.
[119:25.76]It's a grapple.
[119:31.66]Nice Tarzan swing.
[119:39.91]One, two, three.
[119:50.23]Trucker speed.
[119:57.48]Get a running start on this one.
[120:01.86]There we go.
[120:09.43]Boom.
[120:10.40]Second mission done.
[120:11.58]Where are you at?
[120:13.12]Where are you at, bro?
[120:13.96]I'm on the third mission.
[120:15.33]No, you're not.
[120:17.79]You're a liar.
[120:18.31]I don't even know where the third mission is.
[120:37.08]I just picked up some zip ties.
[120:39.44]You know what that means.
[120:40.72]We're gonna have some fun later.
[120:42.60]Shut up!
[120:48.22]I think I'm going the wrong way.
[120:49.08]I got too distracted right there.
[120:51.44]Yeah, I am.
[120:52.46]I had to go like up the mountain.
[120:56.06]Oops, no.
[120:57.40]Oh, I just accepted a side quest.
[121:03.20]I was trying to like launch myself.
[121:15.93]Give me your stupid car.
[121:17.57]Who are you talking?
[121:18.39]Not you.
[121:19.13]Into a pool.
[121:28.18]Speed run.
[121:34.66]Alright, no fucking around.
[121:35.48]Does anyone in your chat know how to abandon a side quest?
[121:38.29]I don't know.
[121:39.87]Let me see.
[121:41.99]Abandon quest.
[121:42.55]Done.
[121:42.91]Figured it out.
[121:44.47]Two steps ahead.
[121:51.06]I'm on mission four, I think.
[121:53.35]No, you're not.
[121:54.91]Yeah, I just finished it.
[121:57.19]No, you're not.
[122:00.11]What are you doing then?
[122:00.91]There's a radio that I'm disabling and there's a new boss, a giant Skag boss.
[122:06.98]A new boss, uh-huh.
[122:08.58]Yeah, tell me more about this boss.
[122:09.62]What do you have to do, like liberate a village or something?
[122:16.44]No, I'm just kidding.
[122:18.72]Whoa!
[122:19.69]Should I not have done that?
[122:20.47]Okay, I'm good.
[122:25.24]Oh, wait.
[122:25.84]Did I not hit the button at the top of the tower?
[122:31.00]No, I did.
[122:31.78]I saw the whole place.
[122:34.52]Where did I miss this gun?
[122:37.38]Did you pick up a gun, Metallix?
[122:38.54]Like, on the second mission?
[122:39.94]Oh, yeah.
[122:41.04]No, I shot a few people.
[122:42.96]I'm on the sixth mission.
[122:44.64]I don't know where you are.
[122:50.67]Why am I shooting arrows?
[122:52.01]Flaming arrows.
[122:53.22]I'm lighting this place on fire.
[122:55.62]Oh, how do you make flaming arrows?
[122:57.68]Well, this guy's an idiot.
[123:01.22]This guy's stupider than me.
[123:03.32]I just picked it up off the dead guy, but you can only hold one weapon at a time, so I had to drop my bow.
[123:11.28]Gimme your weapon, gimme his weapon, gimme his weapon, gimme his weapon.
[123:14.06]Do I have to go to L?
[123:18.62]What the fuck?
[123:20.88]Why is there a lion?
[123:24.86]Gosh.
[123:25.48]What?
[123:26.38]Grapple, grapple, grapple.
[123:29.20]I'm fine.
[123:56.82]My god!
[124:04.31]I'm fine.
[124:07.23]I don't know how I did that.
[124:09.23]Don't ask me how.
[124:16.33]Any more ammo?
[124:18.53]Oh god, it was a Snattercat.
[124:19.57]I only have like three shots in this dumb gun.
[124:28.96]I actually don't know where to go for the next actual campaign mission.
[124:35.78]I think it's this big elf.
[124:38.22]Always break the boxes.
[124:39.00]OK, just remove the fog on the map.
[124:58.29]There's probably gonna be a guy just standing up here, too.
[125:05.66]Is there a grapple hook thing here?
[125:08.06]Am I missing something here?
[125:09.82]Oh, you can just even just climb here.
[125:30.37]Who cares?
[125:32.95]Tightrope walk.
[125:42.77]What are you doing right now?
[125:44.39]I'm on the sixth mission.
[125:47.69]For real, what are you actually doing right now?
[125:50.37]I'm activating the bell tower.
[125:52.03]Okay.
[125:53.07]I'm about to be on this third mission.
[126:02.97]Ban.
[126:03.85]Ban this chat.
[126:11.40]Oh, ruined a perfectly good radio.
[126:18.56]Thought that was me jumping off for a second.
[126:30.93]There's a lot of weird areas in this game.
[126:32.35]Just random open-world stuff.
[126:35.99]Pretty cool.
[126:39.92]Oh, there's a... There's a cantaloupe here.
[126:45.14]Cantaloupe, jaguar, hog, and, uh... Homo sapien.
[126:55.81]Okay, where's the next mission?
[127:04.14]Got a free gun, cool.
[127:08.53]I gotta sell some stuff, I think.
[127:14.03]Okay.
[127:14.67]Ugh, skill points, crafting.
[127:31.97]health slot.
[127:32.93]Actually, that's a pretty big deal.
[127:34.90]Yeah, I want it.
[127:36.90]Three health slots.
[127:38.48]Four health slots cost two.
[127:39.96]Don't have that.
[127:41.18]Co-op!
[127:42.72]Aw.
[127:47.18]Waypoint.
[127:48.20]Waypoint.
[127:51.52]So where's the next story mission?
[127:52.84]Back, like, here?
[127:58.77]I don't really know where to go.
[128:01.20]So remember you were talking about the third mission?
[128:02.46]Like, where is the third mission for the storyline?
[128:04.01]Do you know where it is?
[128:04.99]Uh, the third mission, I went to the letter L on my map, and I think that's the third mission.
[128:11.75]Yeah, it's on my... I pressed M for map, and it's on my map.
[128:16.12]Really?
[128:17.26]Yeah.
[128:18.02]It was like, uh, southeast of the unfoggy area.
[128:21.44]I don't see an L. You don't see an L. No, not right now.
[128:38.54]L. L for loser.
[128:43.69]Well, that's kind of what you're going to be when I finish all my campaign missions first.
[128:47.67]Yeah, I don't know.
[128:53.14]I'm just going to go back here.
[128:54.30]I'm going to go back to the village.
[129:08.05]Get my weapons.
[129:08.79]Oh my god.
[129:11.91]Okay.
[129:15.05]Jesus.
[129:20.72]Uh, conflict diamonds.
[129:26.56]Vintage porn?
[129:28.02]What?
[129:29.93]Okay, well, sell it.
[129:31.13]It's a lot of money.
[129:38.50]no buy and customize weapons alright where's the free one I thought this one was free ak-47 didn't tell me this thing was free what the uh SMG
[130:15.82]Or do I already just have it?
[130:16.68]Oh, there it is.
[130:27.15]Okay.
[130:27.35]I'm just going to buy ammo.
[130:33.31]Buy all ammo.
[130:39.37]Alright, let's do it.
[130:50.38]So where's this L that he's talking about?
[130:55.60]Oh, it's probably going to come up now.
[131:01.76]When you have died, go see him.
[131:03.32]You don't think I'm going to do the jump on somebody from above and kill them instantly?
[131:24.12]Quick sell all the junk.
[131:28.52]Okay, yeah.
[131:29.12]I'll do that next time.
[131:31.26]Hey, there's the L. Stream title is wrong.
[131:38.15]It's Far Cry 4.
[131:39.33]Far Cry money sign with Etalyx.
[131:45.83]How far away is this L?
[131:50.17]Over here.
[131:51.25]That's kind of far away.
[131:54.24]I need my, uh... I need my vehicle.
[132:06.57]We'll do some more hand gliding.
[132:07.53]I love how they just have these set up.
[132:12.19]I love it.
[132:14.05]No, we're gonna do ATV.
[132:18.09]ATV's more fun.
[132:18.89]It's more fluid.
[132:23.32]Set a waypoint.
[132:25.06]Let's go.
[132:25.36]He wants me to go this way, apparently.
[132:38.25]Oh, come on.
[132:38.69]I can skip that, can't I?
[132:40.69]No, it's going to kill me.
[132:43.07]I so badly want to skip this and just jump off and land it.
[132:45.52]But I will die.
[132:47.70]No more goofing, right?
[132:48.98]There's only goofs when a Etalyx is here.
[133:06.17]Auto-drive oh wow This feels like it's not gonna be that reliable, but it's way more reliable than me This is so funny it's so much better of a driver than I am I'm so glad this exists
[133:35.23]Oh, balls.
[133:41.65]Easy now.
[133:48.53]I feel like I can go faster if I do it myself.
[133:50.13]Get out of the way!
[134:04.81]Get out of the way, Grandma!
[134:06.59]I gotta go, I gotta go to the mission.
[134:12.43]I wanna, like, fishtail him.
[134:13.65]Alright, take over.
[134:17.31]Drive for me.
[134:21.26]I got so... The fuck?
[134:25.84]What?
[134:27.08]You gotta be kidding me.
[134:38.15]Where do I go?
[134:39.27]Where do I go?
[134:49.20]Open the door!
[134:49.94]Open the door!
[134:50.36]Wow.
[134:55.92]Wow.
[135:04.31]That scared the absolute shit out of me.
[135:10.19]Ugh, my heart is like killing me.
[135:11.97]I'm fucking around trying to push an old couple off the road.
[135:14.63]I turn around and there's a rhino ramming me.
[135:18.04]the most invigorating weed and one of the elders to me we've not seen cheating the line of the tribe of judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and loose the seven seals
[135:35.13]Go back and fight it?
[135:37.65]I'm not fighting that thing.
[135:40.35]You think I'm going to fight a giant rhinoceros with a bow and arrow and like a tiny little SMG?
[135:50.62]You can craft a second weapon slot right now and buy the wingsuit from the shop.
[136:06.69]Alright, I'll do it.
[136:07.99]Didn't I just buy a bunch of guns?
[136:16.48]He's the rhino in disguise.
[136:18.96]Are you beating me now?
[136:20.28]No, I'm at the third mission.
[136:23.33]You just got to the third mission?
[136:24.67]Yeah, there was a couple of issues that we had to resolve.
[136:31.49]Some major issues.
[136:33.25]Yeah.
[136:34.49]But I'm talking to the guy in the gun hut right now.
[136:37.57]Oh, wow.
[136:39.43]I've finished the whole mission.
[136:43.17]It's been a rough go.
[136:44.49]I'm a whole mission ahead now.
[136:45.83]Some things happened.
[136:47.17]Bad things happened.
[136:48.77]Alright.
[136:51.17]I'm going to end up beating you in the end, though.
[136:53.51]Don't worry.
[136:53.85]3, 2, 1, go.
[136:58.22]Yeah, this is all mandatory for the co-op.
[137:00.96]Etalyx is mad part one.
[137:03.18]Alright.
[137:03.46]Let's do it.
[137:04.06]I have to go save the people in that village.
[137:07.26]You got it.
[137:08.48]Sure thing.
[137:09.08]Okay.
[137:09.22]It was nice knowing you.
[137:11.71]Nice talking to you.
[137:26.69]Why did I just throw... I did not throw that.
[137:34.61]Why is it doing this to me?
[137:37.63]It didn't do that before.
[137:38.47]I don't have time for this.
[137:46.58]Don't have time for this.
[137:54.42]Are you hoping the Rhino is waiting outside?
[137:56.78]That would have been so terrible.
[137:58.68]Weapon slot?
[137:59.58]Oh, god damn it.
[138:00.54]I forgot.
[138:25.26]I got time.
[138:26.16]I got time.
[138:26.52]I have time.
[138:26.90]I have time.
[138:27.76]I got five minutes.
[138:30.38]I got plenty of time.
[138:34.50]I'm gonna go back and pick it up.
[138:42.66]There's still time.
[138:54.14]It's like right here, right?
[138:57.88]Where was the hut?
[139:00.10]Wasn't it like right here?
[139:02.68]Where the fuck did you guys come from?
[139:07.20]Just kill me.
[139:07.74]Kill me.
[139:07.98]Please kill me.
[139:08.64]Just die.
[139:09.31]So I can just do exactly what I just did again.
[139:11.19]Just fucking kill me.
[139:13.87]Please kill me.
[139:15.23]Thank you.
[139:15.53]Okay, now easy.
[139:25.57]Rewind.
[139:26.03]Didn't even happen.
[139:30.64]Alright, we're good.
[139:31.26]Now we're gonna get in the truck this time.
[139:47.15]Alright, auto waypoint.
[139:50.54]I can just like turn and look this way.
[139:52.20]Go, drive!
[139:52.60]Traveling to waypoint.
[140:01.29]Drive?
[140:01.69]What is it doing?
[140:02.77]The auto drive to stop driving.
[140:05.19]Oh my god.
[140:07.77]Rhino brother.
[140:08.99]My rhino friend.
[140:11.18]He's here to help me.
[140:13.12]Oh wow.
[140:14.94]He's here to save me.
[140:17.46]That's awesome.
[140:24.40]He's called me an asshole.
[140:27.36]He's called an asshole.
[140:32.28]Hold on, where's the rhino?
[140:33.07]I want the rhino to come, like, kill me.
[140:41.20]There's a lot going on right now.
[140:42.18]Why is there only one side of the road?
[140:51.13]Why can't there be two?
[141:03.39]I gotta make up some time here.
[141:05.15]I'm gonna just speed through the next mission.
[141:16.92]Germany is a big fat mess.
[141:23.69]It's alright.
[141:24.97]Rescue the town.
[141:27.39]I'm leaving the mission zone.
[141:32.01]What the hell are you talking about?
[141:32.97]It's right here.
[141:41.73]Those are villagers.
[141:42.37]Okay, don't shoot the villagers.
[141:43.33]You got it.
[141:43.65]Is a helicopter flying around?
[141:56.32]Get safety.
[142:00.90]I got you covered.
[142:02.68]Don't worry, everybody here.
[142:03.46]I'm here to save you.
[142:07.74]I have to beat Etalyx.
[142:12.97]I don't know.
[142:13.31]Okay, he's dead.
[142:16.37]What if you just whack yourself a few times?
[142:18.69]That's great.
[142:24.07]Who's left?
[142:27.80]Over here.
[142:29.12]People in distress.
[142:32.68]This guy's still running at me.
[142:37.95]What are you doing?
[142:40.13]Jeez man, easy.
[142:50.58]This is a Dark Souls 3 enemy.
[143:03.94]Detonate the C4.
[143:04.94]No, I don't.
[143:06.74]That's a fucking rocket launcher.
[143:22.03]Wrap it up.
[143:33.95]How many more people do I have to kill?
[143:35.01]Just turns and runs in a gunfight.
[143:53.71]What is the range on this fire, man?
[143:55.15]I feel like it shouldn't be that big.
[144:06.17]Did I do it?
[144:08.75]What the hell is going on?
[144:20.48]All I hear is this- I'll get him.
[144:29.34]It was my rocket launcher.
[144:46.89]What the hell is this?
[144:47.51]It's like a... I don't want it like the tooth cleaning device.
[144:54.80]It's like on fire.
[145:02.50]They're just like fucking everywhere.
[145:03.76]I feel like why is the music so much louder than the game right now?
[145:15.85]All I hear is like... Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[145:17.69]You're definitely going to want to get the hell out of the way, dude.
[145:33.04]Because I don't even care if I run you over or not.
[145:36.31]So what's all this about rhinos?
[145:39.25]Oh, yeah.
[145:39.87]We had a little bit of an issue there.
[145:40.95]Uh-huh.
[145:41.95]A little issue?
[145:42.59]I had a rhino issue earlier.
[145:44.23]I couldn't get away from it.
[145:47.98]Alright, I defended the town.
[145:48.80]I just finished mission four.
[145:51.24]I'm almost a mission and a half ahead, man.
[145:54.98]Are you sure?
[145:57.56]I think I'm one full mission.
[145:59.44]How long ago did you defend the town and go to the other guy?
[146:03.00]10... 15 minutes?
[146:04.15]Yeah, so you're like a mission ahead of him.
[146:09.09]Just get out.
[146:10.49]My goodness.
[146:11.13]No, not you.
[146:11.61]Get out.

[146:42.23]I followed the thing I was supposed to follow.
[146:44.93]What happened?
[146:45.86]I don't know, everyone's like freaking out that I did something wrong.
[146:53.58]There's too much smoke in this house.
[147:01.21]I did it!

[150:15.45]It said, hey, co-op is available.
[150:16.89]And then it said, no, you can't do it yet.
[150:19.51]What happens if you open the co-op screen?

[154:58.58]I was going to roll up here like goddamn Clint Eastwood.
[155:02.44]I'm Herc.
[155:03.48]I heard about you, man.
[155:04.84]Taking names and writing checks out to kick your ass, man.

[155:13.53]I believe we will, after this cutscene is over, I believe we're ready.
[155:17.58]Alright, you invite me so it erases my progress instead of yours.
[155:20.70]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[155:23.34]These guys are really stanky.
[155:40.79]Dude, bro, come on, man.
[155:43.13]Dude.
[155:43.61]Subtitles?
[155:44.05]Yeah, I'll turn them on.
[156:01.43]I really just wish I could skip this and play with my friend Etalyx.
[156:03.98]I would have loved if they just flipped over.
[156:25.17]Okay, open the wheel.
[156:28.13]Open the wheel of fucking destiny.
[156:30.37]Okay, hold V. Guns for hire.
[156:34.64]Okay.
[156:37.52]Invite friends.
[156:39.14]Invite friends.
[156:42.76]Taking a little joyride.
[156:45.34]I've invited you.
[156:45.94]Enjoying the scenery.
[156:47.24]Okay, I hope we're ready.
[156:49.33]Ready?
[156:49.89]I invited you.
[156:50.47]I am loading!
[156:52.17]Oh my goodness.
[156:54.93]Are you going to appear right next to me?
[156:55.95]I hope you will.
[156:57.05]I hope so.
[156:58.59]Finally, we can play.
[157:00.81]Yes.
[157:01.41]At long last.
[157:02.84]At long last, we can play this game together and have fun.
[157:07.02]And then the stream goes down.
[157:10.28]The second we start to have fun.
[157:11.80]Jeremiah has been live for eight minutes.
[157:14.04]Stream goes down.
[157:17.79]Probably better that you invite me because I don't think my mission progress will be saved.
[157:24.39]In your game.
[157:25.53]Probably not.
[157:26.91]Who knows, though.
[157:30.41]You actually really are that guy.
[157:32.13]That really was you.
[157:34.91]Who am I?
[157:35.59]You're the guy that was like, oh, snaky.
[157:37.78]None of your business.
[157:39.54]Alright, let's go.
[157:40.60]You ready to have all kinds of fun?
[157:42.96]No.
[157:43.98]No, I knew it was gonna happen immediately.
[157:46.88]Got ya.
[157:49.52]First one out the door.
[157:50.68]I can't eat.
[157:51.19]I gave up.
[157:51.75]I pushed give up immediately.
[157:53.82]And there's a 16 second respawn time.
[157:55.80]Okay.
[157:56.46]Probably don't push give up in the future.
[157:58.56]Can I pick you up?
[158:00.13]Did you guys see that wicked funny joke I just did?
[158:01.93]I just shot him when he came out the door.
[158:03.17]How funny.
[158:03.55]Are you going to walk over your body?
[158:08.97]Oh, that would have been so funny.
[158:12.01]Spawn behind you.
[158:13.47]Did you really?
[158:15.45]Thank you.
[158:15.91]I appreciate it.
[158:17.17]Alright, get in the car.
[158:24.31]I wanna get in the back.
[158:25.33]You in?
[158:30.11]What the fuck just happened?
[158:31.15]I just wanted to know if it was possible.
[158:32.81]I just wanted to know if it was possible.
[158:34.83]You killed me in the car?
[158:36.93]It's possible.
[158:38.53]Eat lead!
[158:39.57]You can shoot at me while you are down?
[158:41.63]Get outta here!
[158:44.17]Alright, you drive.
[158:44.75]I'm not driving.
[158:47.45]Nah, he's gonna shoot me in the head.
[158:49.31]Nah, he's gonna shoot me in the head.
[158:50.91]I'm not gonna shoot you.
[158:52.45]Mhm.
[158:56.06]I'm not gonna.
[158:57.90]I have a gun too.
[158:58.64]I'm not gonna shoot you, I promise.
[159:00.40]You're pointing right at me.
[159:01.82]So are you.
[159:03.76]You're pointing right at me.
[159:04.64]Are you feeling lucky?
[159:06.34]Where are we going?
[159:07.24]We have to go get a mission.
[159:14.71]Can I just throw rocks out the window?
[159:16.21]Oh, I wish these rocks would hurt you.
[159:20.81]Alright, let's look at the map.
[159:27.34]We can probably just fast travel here and get a mission or something, right?
[159:30.66]To, uh, Banipur Village.
[159:32.74]Uh, what is the mission that we are even supposed to do?
[159:36.36]I want my own car.
[159:38.36]I've decided.
[159:39.88]Well, then drive this one.
[159:41.24]What's the difference?
[159:41.90]Just drive this one.
[159:42.96]No.
[159:43.42]You're the one that told me to drive this one.
[159:45.56]Yeah, because then we can... No, we can... Hang on, your walking animation is not working.
[159:50.70]It's not?
[159:51.82]No.
[159:53.24]What do you mean by walking animation?
[159:54.36]I'm in a car.
[159:54.98]No.
[159:55.64]No.
[159:56.50]No, you're not.
[159:58.68]I was just in a car.
[160:00.03]No, there's no car here.
[160:01.27]Where am I?
[160:01.71]I'm in a car right now.
[160:02.99]Where am I?
[160:03.97]You're in front of me.
[160:05.39]Well, stop moving.
[160:06.01]You're telling me I'm not in a car.
[160:07.55]No, you're not in a car.
[160:08.71]I'm not in a car.
[160:09.83]Where am I?
[160:10.91]You're behind me right now, in the car.
[160:13.41]Yeah, but I'm not like in the car, right?
[160:14.82]I'm just poking through the car.
[160:15.88]Did she run me over?
[160:21.05]Yes, I did, because I'm in a car.
[160:22.77]In your invisible Wonder Woman car?
[160:27.80]I want to see what the hell you're talking about.
[160:31.28]There's no car there.
[160:32.58]It's like you're in noclip mode.
[160:35.36]Okay, maybe I'm not, because I can't hurt these guys.
[160:40.39]But every so often, you do a little bunny hop for some reason.
[160:45.33]If you're in the car, why are you bunny hopping?
[160:47.15]That's crazy that there's no car for you here.
[160:50.28]There's still no car.
[160:51.48]Hold on.
[160:51.74]Are you in the car?
[160:56.53]No, I'm just standing.
[160:58.57]I'm just standing like no clipping through your invisible car.
[161:02.13]That's so weird.
[161:04.45]You're just walking around.
[161:05.99]I have no... There's a car here though, right?
[161:08.69]Oh yeah, no, this car is here.
[161:10.29]This car exists in real life.
[161:12.01]Alright, so get out of the way.
[161:14.20]Okay.
[161:14.94]I want to do something here.
[161:15.70]I want you to see.
[161:16.34]Yeah.
[161:18.02]Yeah.
[161:19.55]You want to ram that car?
[161:20.51]I'm going to ram this car directly in the road.
[161:23.67]That makes sense.
[161:27.37]I don't know how to get out of the way.
[161:28.63]I can't see your car.
[161:30.72]Okay.
[161:32.20]You're just sprinting.
[161:36.02]Okay, you actually were walking.
[161:37.46]I'm going to smash the invisible car.
[161:39.96]Just don't drive off a cliff.
[161:41.22]Be careful.
[161:42.14]I'm not going to.
[161:48.46]Yeah, your car just spontaneously started moving slower for no reason.
[161:52.76]I want you to try hitting this car.
[161:53.86]Let's go.
[161:54.08]Let's get the heck out of here.
[161:56.00]Hit this car with the invisible car at full speed.
[161:58.32]I want to see what happens.
[162:01.10]Why are we doing this shit?
[162:03.83]No, you get in that car.
[162:04.83]No, you get out of your car.
[162:05.61]Go in this car.
[162:06.15]And then we're going to go in this car.
[162:08.13]I just want to see if the real car moves.
[162:14.12]It does.
[162:14.56]Alright, you get in that car.
[162:18.52]We're taking the invisible car for a ride.
[162:20.04]I'm not leaving this car.
[162:23.72]Take the invisible car.
[162:24.50]I'm gonna follow you.
[162:25.06]Uh-huh.
[162:27.56]Now, what happens if I try to run into you?
[162:29.76]You tell me.
[162:30.16]Because in my client, I can just walk straight through.
[162:32.56]Okay, so go further down the road.
[162:36.56]Gotta be like at full speed.
[162:38.12]I'm gonna turn around up here.
[162:39.06]Alright, so if I drive full speed, am I just like walking?
[162:44.56]Oh, where'd you go?
[162:45.88]Yeah, you're just bunny-hopping up the road.
[162:47.62]You're bunny-hopping up the road.
[162:50.91]Okay, I can't seem to affect anything in the game.
[162:53.45]Here I come.
[162:54.57]I can't affect this shit.
[162:55.93]Ready or not.
[163:03.57]No, I can't stop.
[163:04.83]Keep going.
[163:06.58]Alright, here I come.
[163:07.66]Here I come in my invisible car.
[163:11.32]It doesn't take damage.
[163:13.34]It doesn't exist.
[163:16.64]It doesn't exist, you're right.
[163:17.88]It doesn't exist.
[163:18.74]No, it doesn't.
[163:19.60]That's perfect.
[163:20.63]I can't wait to use this thing for the rest of the game.
[163:23.61]I wish I could get in.
[163:24.31]Shit, I don't think I can.
[163:25.41]That would be the most fun part.
[163:28.27]Uh-oh.
[163:28.39]Alright, are you stuck?
[163:30.27]I think the invisible car might be done.
[163:32.78]Uh-oh.
[163:34.28]Come and ram me.
[163:36.08]Okay.
[163:36.48]Alright, come drive really slowly into me.
[163:39.62]You're a small target.
[163:41.10]That's the only problem.
[163:42.24]I'm going to explode.
[163:43.37]Like, the person's going to blow up on your end.
[163:50.41]Yeah, just a little further.
[163:52.27]Just a little bit further.
[163:53.27]Thank you.
[163:54.05]Come smash me.
[163:54.89]Alright, I hope you guys have the multi-Twitch open, because I wonder how stupid this is going to be.
[164:02.64]Hang on, I've got to get more build-up.
[164:07.22]Alright, this should be far enough.
[164:08.26]Alright, come run into me.
[164:10.68]I'm just a person.
[164:11.82]Here we go.
[164:13.04]You are just a person.
[164:16.98]You guy just went, my car caught fire.
[164:21.84]Why is my car on fire?
[164:25.39]Your car is just jumping up and down while... What?
[164:29.55]What?
[164:29.75]Why is there fire everywhere?
[164:34.19]Help me.
[164:35.45]Help me.
[164:37.22]Help me.
[164:38.96]Come rescue me.
[164:40.48]You're in the middle of a forest fire.
[164:43.34]That's so funny that that card doesn't exist on your stream.
[164:47.28]Alright, so we're good.
[164:49.14]Your car is okay.
[164:49.82]We can take your car.
[164:52.14]Well, it's... Oh, shit, it's actually... It's kind of okay.
[164:55.36]Did I spread it to you?
[164:56.68]It's in the fire.
[164:58.06]Oh, no, now my car exploded.
[165:00.88]Alright.
[165:02.18]Well, then we're back to square one.
[165:07.19]Alright, so where are we going to go?
[165:08.25]Let's just go back to town.
[165:09.53]I have no idea.
[165:11.25]Let's go get a mission.
[165:11.85]Did you move to?
[165:12.43]Hey, you teleported me.
[165:18.19]Alright, what can we do here for actual missions?
[165:23.67]We can go hostage rescue.
[165:26.97]There should be a real mission.
[165:28.73]Is there a real mission?
[165:29.37]I don't see anything.
[165:31.97]Can you even do real missions in co-op?
[165:34.86]Thought that was the whole point.
[165:35.68]Thought it was a co-op campaign.
[165:38.56]I don't know.
[165:41.24]I don't have any missions on my map.
[165:43.98]Um... Okay, get out of there.
[165:52.91]Maybe we have to go get some more, like, outposts?
[165:56.35]Let's go get an outpost.
[165:57.83]I see something over here.
[165:58.63]This is the hostage rescue.
[166:03.68]Kill Royal Army soldiers and rescue the hostages in this quest.
[166:06.06]Stay undetected.
[166:06.82]Do you see this thing, hostage rescue?
[166:11.12]I mean, we can like go here, but didn't we already do this?
[166:13.79]I'm going to fast travel us to Ryder.
[166:15.99]I think whatever you take, I'll just be on that mission.
[166:21.63]We can't do any main story missions, apparently.
[166:24.21]What?
[166:25.15]Yeah, we can do like... There's a bunch of gunfire.
[166:31.21]I'm going to just walk out the door.
[166:32.47]Oh, let's go.
[166:36.00]Here we go.
[166:37.34]Alright.
[166:38.14]Where's the... Where are all these explosions coming from?
[166:40.81]I think karma events.
[166:45.07]Okay.
[166:47.47]I understand.
[166:48.03]Karma events.
[166:49.91]I understand.
[166:51.01]I understand.
[166:51.45]There's something going on up there.
[166:54.10]Oh, okay.
[166:54.48]Karma event.
[166:55.20]Go up to the purple.
[166:57.06]I'm getting in.
[167:01.60]We gotta go save the villages up there in the karma event.
[167:05.56]Here we go.
[167:11.91]Nice.
[167:13.69]Alright, let's get him.
[167:14.71]Get out of the car.
[167:16.21]Use your weapons.
[167:16.75]Oh, I just drive around.
[167:20.49]The car is my weapon!
[167:21.33]Oh, I just drive around.
[167:27.16]That was easy.
[167:28.68]We got good karma for that.
[167:29.78]We gotta go, like, attack a fortress.
[167:31.64]Yeah, we gotta go attack a fort.
[167:32.78]Alright, get in the car and drive us to a new fortress.
[167:35.68]I got a better idea.
[167:36.88]Hold on.
[167:39.87]You go towards the fortress and I'll catch up, alright?
[167:42.57]What do you mean you'll catch up?
[167:44.06]Just trust me.
[167:45.12]Trust me.
[167:47.50]Alright.
[167:48.48]You gotta trust me.
[167:50.02]Alright, we're gonna liberate that bell tower.
[167:55.20]Can we even go over there?
[167:58.03]I'm just gonna go explore.
[168:08.00]Don't even tell me that I just got locked in here.
[168:11.96]Did I just cage myself like the elephant?
[168:13.80]Yeah, I did.
[168:19.78]Get me out of here!
[168:21.48]Come on!
[168:22.54]Why are you so stuck?
[168:23.76]Because I jumped off the cliff.
[168:27.65]Get the fruit stand out of the way.
[168:28.85]Oh, I think we had the same idea.
[168:31.93]Did we have the same idea with the helicopter?
[168:34.23]Yeah, that was my idea.
[168:35.83]I just couldn't figure out how to get to it.
[168:38.67]You can take it.
[168:39.93]I thought I was going to catch up.
[168:41.37]Probably not.
[168:42.85]What the hell is this?
[168:44.07]You weren't supposed to be that observant.
[168:45.23]I was told you were very ADD.
[168:47.25]I am.
[168:49.61]You got like a little drone?
[168:52.30]No, come back.
[168:55.08]Come back down.
[168:56.34]Come back down.
[168:56.76]I don't know how.
[168:59.72]I actually don't know how to do it.
[169:02.32]Control.
[169:03.16]No, it's just shift.
[169:04.30]Is it control?
[169:05.64]C?
[169:06.32]C. Okay.
[169:07.24]Coming down.
[169:14.62]Too far.
[169:14.88]Are you just latched onto me?
[169:16.40]Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.
[169:23.26]Are you serious?
[169:25.16]Oh, no, I lagged.
[169:26.76]It caught me on.
[169:27.80]Come back.
[169:28.70]Oh, my God.
[169:29.38]If you could do this just cause two.
[169:33.30]Get up there on that mountain and do it.
[169:35.18]Are you on?
[169:36.08]Yeah.
[169:36.74]Alright.
[169:36.98]Pull up a little.
[169:38.35]Yeah.
[169:39.15]Coming up.
[169:42.66]Oh, there's the rotors.
[169:45.40]I can't even see you.
[169:47.90]Hey, what's up?
[169:49.36]Oh, you're in here?
[169:51.58]I found a little spot.
[169:52.58]Hold on a second.
[169:53.18]You need to do that again.
[169:53.88]I need to drive us into a fucking mountain when you do that.
[169:58.69]Hang on.
[169:58.91]I wonder if I can, like, lower.
[170:00.59]Fuck these guys in the car.
[170:03.79]That's not how you lower.
[170:06.43]You definitely have.
[170:07.05]I have to drag you into a mountain.
[170:09.35]Just stay hooked on, but don't climb all the way up.
[170:13.57]I have 10 seconds to respawn.
[170:15.33]Is there a third person mode?
[170:16.33]Can I pull the camera back?
[170:20.25]Let's take a look at the keyboard settings.
[170:22.19]Because I definitely have to drive you around like this and slam you into a house.

[173:41.55]You ready?
[173:41.83]I'm just going right through the trees.
[173:42.99]Alright.
[173:46.73]Look, there's like a lighthouse over there to your left.
[173:49.25]Oh, yeah?
[173:50.51]Is there?
[173:52.13]It's blinking red.
[173:55.22]Oh, no.
[173:55.54]I'm too low!
[174:00.04]I can't see you.
[174:00.92]I feel like Tarzan right now.
[174:02.24]I don't even know where we are.
[174:08.52]What?
[174:09.44]What?
[174:10.61]Why are there people here?
[174:11.51]There's a band of rebels over here.
[174:14.91]I can't shoot.
[174:15.45]I'm out of bullets.
[174:16.57]Watch out, quick.
[174:18.73]You gotta get lower.
[174:19.55]Get on.
[174:19.87]I'm gonna die.
[174:21.11]Watch out, quick.
[174:23.17]I'm dead.
[174:23.66]You gotta come rescue me.
[174:24.96]I'm coming to rescue.
[174:25.60]Alright, you do that.
[174:27.48]I wanna do that.
[174:27.90]I wanna see how fun it is.
[174:29.32]Okay.
[174:31.96]You're gonna get so ill, by the way.
[174:36.52]You're dead.
[174:37.90]I got here in not enough time.
[174:41.00]10 seconds.
[174:41.34]Just kill these fools right here.
[174:45.41]You're gonna die too.
[174:55.57]I'm alive!
[174:56.03]I need to reload.
[175:00.03]It's doing the thing where if you sprint, you don't reload.
[175:02.77]I've got to get used to that.
[175:05.27]Why is Seed... Seed is in?
[175:09.44]Come rescue me!
[175:11.98]Alright, I'm going to latch on.
[175:15.30]You've got to be lower.
[175:17.46]Come down lower, come down lower.
[175:20.74]How do you latch on?
[175:21.16]This is plenty low.
[175:22.10]It's like... Did you not get the grappling hook?
[175:24.17]I thought I had it, yeah.
[175:24.93]I got it in the first mission, didn't I?
[175:26.03]It should just be E when you're looking at me.
[175:27.71]No, I can't do it.
[175:30.58]Maybe it's like a client thing where you have to be the... I don't know.
[175:35.80]That's weird.
[175:37.86]Come down, like, really low.
[175:43.16]Yeah, I have no option for it.
[175:45.88]Unless, like, do I have to get it?
[175:46.86]Oh, no.
[175:47.06]There we go.
[175:47.36]Okay, I got it.
[175:47.66]There we go.
[175:47.90]So, I'm on.
[175:48.16]You having fun yet?
[175:49.16]Here we go!
[176:01.47]Right into, like, the lighthouse.
[176:06.59]Nope, it didn't work.
[176:08.05]I got detached.
[176:08.47]Oh, it didn't?
[176:10.60]Awww.
[176:10.80]Alright, fly back around.
[176:13.36]No Hulk smash?
[176:16.40]Fly by me, I'm gonna grab you while you're flying by.
[176:21.22]Gotta come low enough, though.
[176:24.66]Here we go!
[176:25.54]Let's move!
[176:34.86]I don't think it's functioning as intended.
[176:37.08]Okay, I latched on, and you were very far away by the time the rope was on, and I pulled myself, and I just, like, yanked the chain around my neck and instantly died.
[176:45.02]Yep.
[176:51.29]Roadhog.
[176:54.07]Alright, I'm in.
[176:55.39]Let's go do a mission before we both throw up.
[177:00.20]Uh... Okay.
[177:03.04]Doctor's orders.
[177:08.88]Alright, make a very sharp right.
[177:14.02]I'm trying to shoot you right in the head.
[177:17.71]Make a very sharp right.
[177:19.99]Oh, no.
[177:24.93]I can't believe you've done this.
[177:28.67]I didn't think it was going to blow the thing up.
[177:31.73]It's gone.
[177:33.37]The friend copter is gone.
[177:34.69]I really didn't think it was going to do that.
[177:38.41]Let's get this outpost.
[177:40.67]This is not an outpost.
[177:44.15]This is just like a stupid Assassin's Creed eagle perch.
[177:47.85]Outpost.
[177:52.33]Outpost was this way.
[177:53.50]If he was turning his head fast enough, I was trying to shoot him right in the head.
[177:58.84]Let's go to the outpost.
[177:59.56]Let's get this over with.
[178:06.23]How many seconds until I get shot in the head?
[178:08.65]Oh, that's a good question.
[178:11.97]Thanks a lot.
[178:12.61]Shield.
[178:13.11]Do not kill innocent civilians.
[178:15.61]Shieldsy!
[178:16.10]I think it's this way.
[178:19.10]You're taking us on a really, really weird trip here.
[178:21.84]Pretty sure it's this way.
[178:23.20]Yeah, no problem.
[178:23.66]See, how come when I do that, it explodes, but when you do it, we're perfectly fine?
[178:27.88]Because I'm the driver.
[178:31.96]Yeah, you're a pretty good driver.
[178:35.13]I'm the dry.
[178:36.49]We said that as you crash into like three trees.
[178:40.77]Just one.
[178:43.31]Watch out for the elephant.
[178:45.29]Where?
[178:46.09]Right there.
[178:48.01]When I say watch out for the elephant, I don't mean turn and go.
[178:54.71]What the hell?
[178:58.16]You can actually do that.
[179:06.85]I'm dead.
[179:08.89]I'm dead, you killed me.
[179:10.65]Hold on, I'm dealing with some of my consequences.
[179:14.34]Oh, watch out for the truck, watch out for the truck.
[179:19.56]What?
[179:21.48]He just kind of ran over.
[179:22.93]That's not a happy elephant.
[179:25.17]No, it's not.
[179:29.80]I want to ride him.
[179:30.66]How do I ride him?
[179:31.22]Just hold E?
[179:31.68]You have to have the skill.
[179:33.24]Have you put a skill in yet?
[179:35.88]Not on that.
[179:37.36]He seems to not care anymore, so we're good.
[179:41.02]Let me see my skills.
[179:44.76]Knife throw, loot takedown, running focus driver, moving target.
[179:48.76]Is it on the right?
[179:49.24]Oh, the elephant.
[179:50.04]Is it on the right side?
[179:51.26]Yeah, it's on the right side.
[179:55.44]Did you do that or did he do that?
[179:57.54]I did.
[179:59.71]I'm sorry.
[180:00.25]I just wanted to push the truck.
[180:01.89]Alright.
[180:02.29]It's in skills.
[180:03.29]It's on the bottom right first tier.
[180:07.97]Elephant rider.
[180:08.51]There it is.
[180:08.92]Okay, cool.
[180:11.36]Hold E, charge.
[180:12.92]Oh, yeah.
[180:14.04]That's awesome.
[180:14.98]Can we both get on one?
[180:17.28]Let's find out.
[180:20.95]You scoot forward as if there's room for me, but there's not.
[180:23.99]Alright.
[180:30.95]That actually hurt you.
[180:31.93]It killed you.
[180:33.00]Oh, yeah.
[180:34.02]It was also less funny than I thought.
[180:35.98]I wasn't even... I just was walking forward.
[180:37.64]I didn't think it was going to instantly kill you.
[180:38.72]I was expecting the bash to, like, shoot me across the environment button, you know, just insta-down me.
[180:44.79]Alright, let's go cause some trouble.
[180:47.39]Hang on, uh, some of us... Yeah, some of us have to ride in cars.
[180:52.61]So, I'm in... I'm gonna be in my car.
[180:54.81]This is my car.
[181:01.67]You spun so many times.
[181:02.49]I'm so close to death.
[181:03.43]You spun like five times.
[181:04.91]Alright, no more fucking around.
[181:06.93]Pray to the elephant, that's right.
[181:07.99]All my fingers are broken, hold on.
[181:09.93]I just spit out a tooth.
[181:10.97]So what happens if I take the elephant off a jump?
[181:18.02]We're gonna go off a jump with the elephant.
[181:25.32]That did nothing.
[181:28.53]Nice job.
[181:29.57]Nice job jamming it right into the tree.
[181:32.20]No, I was trying to push you off the ledge.
[181:37.44]Let's go!
[181:37.90]You just got in front of me.
[181:42.79]That's all that happened.
[181:46.05]Oh, I gotta heal myself three times in a row now.
[181:49.51]I'm stuck on your car.
[181:50.29]There you go.
[181:51.67]Hey, look, look, look, look!
[181:52.39]An elephant for you.
[181:54.41]Oh, yeah!
[181:58.61]Hey!
[181:59.35]Easy!
[182:00.41]I didn't mean that was an accident.
[182:08.00]Ah, yes.
[182:09.74]Now we can be elephant friends.
[182:12.28]Elephant Wars.
[182:14.66]We're gonna have like a rock-em-sock-em robot fight.
[182:17.32]That's what it looks like.
[182:18.00]Charging the stump.
[182:19.34]This is the outpost.
[182:21.06]Well, we're gonna get it.
[182:22.60]Holy shit, that guy got sucked by a magnet to the left of the screen.
[182:26.92]Wait, what?
[182:31.28]Well, we're gonna have some more friends here in just a minute too.
[182:33.42]Oh my god.
[182:36.85]They go flying.
[182:38.41]They go absolutely flying.
[182:46.58]Look at this guy.
[182:47.12]This guy doesn't even know.
[182:50.42]How do you creep up behind somebody when you're on an elephant?
[182:52.60]I don't know.
[182:52.88]I don't understand how it's possible.
[182:54.06]There's no sneaking from that point on.
[182:55.38]I did.
[182:56.38]I snuck up on that guy.
[183:00.52]Alright, there's going to be some oncoming traffic.
[183:03.30]Look up the road.
[183:04.04]Now's your chance for some fun.
[183:05.60]Oncoming traffic where?
[183:06.46]Right here.
[183:13.37]See ya.
[183:14.75]See ya later.
[183:15.59]Whoa.
[183:17.57]I'm stuck in the car.
[183:18.35]Okay.
[183:19.75]Can we still move around?
[183:21.25]Aww.
[183:23.41]Totally liberated that outpost.
[183:25.87]Yeah, we liberated those people.
[183:29.22]Alright, where's the next spot?
[183:31.18]Oh, I see an unknown location.
[183:34.20]Behind us.
[183:34.56]Let's go to the unknown location.
[183:43.73]Why would you park your car in the way?
[183:44.81]There's people shooting us now.
[183:47.81]I think those are good guys who you've upset.
[183:51.09]We just liberated this place.
[183:53.95]It's not my fault.
[183:55.43]They were shooting me and there was a stick in my arm.
[183:57.33]Oh man, I'm getting shot up.
[184:00.60]Let me get the stick out of my arm.
[184:08.56]Oh my god.
[184:09.46]They really do go flying.
[184:18.53]My hand is really broken.
[184:24.22]I thought that was her that did that.
[184:26.18]Did that girl just do that to the car?
[184:32.72]That girl had the strength of an elephant.
[184:35.15]Watch out for the random guy that's just driving on vacation with his family.
[184:39.43]Are you dead?
[184:40.13]Did I kill you?
[184:42.07]Yes, you did.
[184:43.31]Oh, sorry.
[184:44.69]I thought you were still on an elephant.
[184:46.41]No, they got my elephant.
[184:48.19]What bastards?
[184:50.18]They killed it?
[184:52.16]They killed Ellie?
[184:53.68]They did.
[184:54.08]Now I have to... Now I have to push this car over.
[184:58.27]Let me help.
[184:58.71]Back up, watch out.
[185:00.29]There's another guy coming down the middle of the road.
[185:03.15]Where is he?
[185:04.90]What the fuck is happening?
[185:06.50]Oh, it's you again.
[185:10.68]Why is there a car flip over?
[185:12.44]Why did it just flip over?
[185:13.90]My screen... Oh, wait, let me just... Oh my gosh.
[185:16.73]That's so stupid how you can just do that.
[185:19.79]Let's go.
[185:22.23]I'm getting in a real car.
[185:23.85]Alright.
[185:26.23]You lead the way.
[185:28.78]Wait, by FOV reset?
[185:30.24]Are you sure?
[185:31.04]That's what I thought too, but I don't know.
[185:33.22]I think it just looked like it did, but it didn't.
[185:35.32]It's all the way up, as high as it can go.
[185:36.46]This is as high as it can put it.
[185:44.26]See, I might be outrunning you right now, man.
[185:46.88]Oh yeah, sorry, I had to... Oh, tab, coming!
[185:48.74]Coming!
[185:50.28]Why isn't there a horn?
[185:53.16]Seriously, I want to just be real clear about this.
[185:56.46]Why?
[185:57.78]Why on Earth would you park in the middle of the fucking road?
[186:03.43]Honestly.
[186:05.05]What are these guys doing?
[186:07.39]They just decided to get out of the car and park in the middle of the road and stand here.
[186:11.79]There's no one there, by the way.
[186:13.27]What do you mean there's no one here?
[186:14.99]No one there.
[186:18.95]Run right into me.
[186:20.82]Just ram into me.
[186:21.66]You tell me there's nobody right here.
[186:22.94]Is there an invisible car?
[186:24.18]Get in the invisible car.
[186:25.18]There's an invisible car.
[186:27.08]There's invisible people now, apparently.
[186:28.92]Yeah, invisible car and people.
[186:30.34]Tell me when you're in the car.
[186:31.82]Well, I want you to ram this person.
[186:33.36]This invisible person.
[186:34.36]Coming.
[186:34.78]Straight at you.
[186:35.18]Straight at me.
[186:37.92]You went right by them.
[186:38.64]They don't exist.
[186:39.94]These zombie people just don't make any sense.
[186:48.22]I just hit something on my screen.
[186:49.97]Yeah, you hit a car.
[186:50.77]It's always the blue car.
[186:52.59]What's with the blue car on your screen not existing?
[186:56.43]This car exists.
[186:57.37]Yeah.
[186:57.83]Wait, this one?
[186:58.33]The one I'm in?
[186:58.95]Yeah, that one exists.
[187:00.01]So the other one doesn't.
[187:01.47]No.
[187:02.35]It's like weird family car that they had.
[187:10.21]I'm in a car.
[187:15.12]uh no you're not well hold on let me heal there's another elephant over here hold on so I need to just get rid of the people that don't exist do not kill innocent civilians yeah don't kill innocent ghost civilians that don't exist yeah great let's go

[187:45.38]Oh, no.
[187:46.40]I can't see it, so it's much more difficult to hit.
[187:48.97]Alright, here we go.
[187:49.85]Here comes another one.
[187:50.69]Okay, another person driving straight at me.
[187:53.35]Oh, wasn't this fun?
[187:54.13]Wasn't this fun?
[187:59.77]You know, wherever we are, they really need to invest in having more than one...
[188:05.96]My elephant!
[188:07.34]What happened?
[188:08.02]Why is my elephant dead?
[188:11.05]Maybe it's because you rammed him.
[188:14.59]Into what?
[188:15.39]What did I ram him into?
[188:16.21]But he's naked.
[188:16.99]This guy's naked.
[188:18.99]What?
[188:19.53]There's no guy.
[188:19.93]There's a naked guy.
[188:20.85]Why am I dead?
[188:22.35]Did you just run me over?
[188:24.11]There's a guy with no clothes on over here.
[188:29.76]Oh no, he has clothes on.
[188:30.56]Never mind.
[188:31.06]Help.
[188:35.85]He's like a beast, just hiding in the water.
[188:39.11]You don't see the crazy guy throwing knives at us right now?
[188:43.96]No.
[188:44.52]None of these people that are shooting at us don't exist to you.
[188:46.64]How is this even possible?
[188:48.26]You're being lit up right now.
[188:50.38]No, I'm not.
[188:52.00]Everything's fine, I'm just skinning this elephant.
[188:56.13]Where are they?
[188:56.77]You can't see this guy?
[188:57.41]God dammit, no!
[189:05.65]I want him to attack you.
[189:06.67]Oh, he will.
[189:07.55]Okay, you'll never die.
[189:08.97]Oh, why am I instantly dead?
[189:11.81]I'm telling you, there's a guy with a giant knife running after both of us.
[189:18.06]What?
[189:20.28]What?
[189:20.70]He's killing me and then killing you with the knife.
[189:23.92]We're dead.
[189:24.22]This is so dumb.
[189:36.03]Oh no, there's something going on out here.
[189:39.21]There's a fight.
[189:49.53]I got one.
[189:50.97]You had the same idea.
[189:52.13]You were going to do the same thing?
[189:53.79]Yes, except I was going to throw something else.
[189:56.10]I'm dead.
[189:56.68]I'm down.
[189:57.98]I hit myself with that.
[189:58.96]Alright, let's go liberate another village.
[190:01.96]What do you say?
[190:04.24]You drive.
[190:09.52]What's going on?
[190:10.22]What the fuck is happening right now?
[190:14.46]It's my revenge.
[190:15.48]Why did the car... You're throwing... Here comes another guy with a knife.
[190:19.73]I can see these guys.
[190:20.57]You can see this guy.
[190:21.37]Yeah.
[190:22.01]Give yourself up.
[190:26.35]Give yourself up.
[190:29.51]Let me fresco.
[190:31.74]Oh, he got nothing on him.
[190:32.72]He had a pager.
[190:36.90]Make sure you watch out for shenanigans.
[190:41.89]Alright, I'm going to the next mission.
[190:44.55]I'll go.
[190:45.63]Get out in here.
[190:48.00]You stupid... We haven't done one mission.
[190:50.34]What do you mean the next mission?
[190:51.36]I can't help it.
[190:52.04]I... What is...
[190:55.03]There's a bear.
[190:55.71]There's a bear?
[190:56.53]This is a wild bear.
[190:58.01]He's standing on his hind legs.
[191:00.17]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[191:00.83]Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[191:03.05]What is with this game?
[191:04.22]This game is insane.
[191:06.50]It's just fucking bears just randomly attacking this town.
[191:12.92]What did you just throw in here?
[191:14.40]I threw the bait in the room with you.
[191:17.36]Where'd it go?
[191:20.04]He's stuck.
[191:20.56]He can't get in here.
[191:21.32]Don't wait.
[191:21.74]Easy, easy.
[191:25.45]My FOV reset now.
[191:27.09]He is just attacking.
[191:28.87]Nothing.
[191:31.67]Don't get too close, Italic.
[191:32.59]Don't get too close.
[191:34.75]What's the worst that's going to happen?
[191:37.13]I think you re-glitched him and now he's getting intelligence.
[191:42.79]He's gaining intelligence.
[191:44.85]Stay there.
[191:45.25]Stay there.
[191:46.17]Keep him in that door.
[191:47.15]He glitched.
[191:49.01]He's in the room.
[191:50.34]He's in the room?
[191:51.38]He's in the room with me.
[191:52.28]He doesn't know I'm here.
[191:53.52]Oh, now he does.
[191:56.28]I was going to come up and just run over.
[191:57.42]No, he's stuck in the house.
[192:00.42]He really is stuck in there.
[192:01.89]It's the opposite problem we were having before.
[192:03.49]Is there a motorcycle?
[192:04.55]Now he's out.
[192:08.13]Alright, this is not working.
[192:11.23]Not working at all.
[192:17.67]Let me in.
[192:18.33]He's so angry.
[192:20.19]Why is he this angry?
[192:21.31]Alright, hold on.
[192:27.67]Where's he going?
[192:28.31]We need to follow him.
[192:32.19]They're taking the scenic route around the side.
[192:35.85]Now we can't move at all.
[192:36.98]Now we can't move.
[192:38.14]Wait, wait, wait.
[192:38.82]I got it.
[192:40.64]You're not going to make it up those stairs.
[192:42.24]Yes, I am.
[192:42.74]No, you're not.
[192:44.42]Don't ever tell me I can't do something, Etalyx.
[192:47.14]Never tell me the odds.
[192:50.18]You're not going to make it.
[192:51.88]Yeah.
[192:54.32]Not gonna make any sense, huh?
[192:55.72]We're going the opposite into another wall.
[192:58.34]I can't move at all.
[193:00.46]Not at all.
[193:02.31]Where's the elephant when you need him?
[193:03.63]Bust me out of this.
[193:08.47]Where's the bear?
[193:11.67]Where'd he go?
[193:12.05]He's probably long gone by now.
[193:14.18]Gone?
[193:15.40]Yeah, these guys seem fine.
[193:17.32]If there was a bear over here, you'd think they'd know about it.
[193:19.18]Isn't that him?
[193:21.67]That's an aardvark.
[193:22.47]No, these are aardvarks.
[193:23.71]It's not an aardvark.
[193:25.71]These are like... Whoa!
[193:28.09]Hey!
[193:28.43]There's red guys.
[193:33.62]Where are they going?
[193:35.40]There he is!
[193:35.96]There he is!
[193:36.50]There's the bear!
[193:36.92]There's the bear!
[193:38.06]He's on our team.
[193:38.96]Back on the trail.
[193:40.46]Get him!
[193:41.40]Oh!
[193:42.32]Oh my god!
[193:43.16]He's ripping them apart.
[193:44.81]I love this safari.
[193:46.29]This is a great safari.
[193:47.47]You get to see people get eaten.
[193:50.21]Follow him.
[193:58.60]I'll defeat the bear.
[194:00.30]He doesn't care.
[194:01.36]This really is a safari, like a Cuban bear murder safari.
[194:05.44]Oh, watch now as we follow the bear.
[194:07.18]If you look outside your left, he's going to eat some fucking person.
[194:10.18]It's pretty ridiculous.
[194:12.66]That'll be $3.99 a seat.
[194:13.34]Oh.
[194:21.65]We continue to follow the bear, chasing him on his insatiable bloodlust.
[194:25.85]It cannot be quenched, only if he kills at least five people.
[194:31.81]You'll notice the bear doesn't even stop to consume the corpse.
[194:35.00]He's only satisfied by the act of killing.
[194:37.32]Where'd he go?
[194:39.60]Uh, to the right.
[194:41.02]Oh no!
[194:41.60]Shit!
[194:41.76]Dammit!
[194:43.44]Dammit!
[194:45.40]Dammit!
[194:50.27]Before the wardens find out.
[194:51.67]God damn it, I wasn't... Well, that was Ash fun.
[195:01.20]What a wild game.
[195:03.16]Oh, are we in the air?
[195:06.90]That's an elephant.
[195:10.22]He's just rolling down the hill.
[195:11.42]There's a little smoke.
[195:17.57]What's this?
[195:19.55]What's in here?
[195:20.53]We found something.
[195:29.27]Not so fast.
[195:31.45]You're gonna get in a little canoe.
[195:33.53]Not so fast.
[195:35.91]I'm trying to heal up if you're wondering what I'm doing.
[195:38.11]I think I'm rowing the boat for you.
[195:42.18]How many holes do I have to put in this boat before it sinks?
[195:44.64]Oh my gosh.
[195:45.80]So much damage.
[195:49.06]Okay, that was... Okay, hold on.
[195:51.52]That was a robot.
[195:53.10]It exploded.
[195:54.05]Robots don't... There's no engine on that boat.
[195:56.15]It just blew up.
[195:57.23]There was a little engine.
[195:57.97]There was a little baby engine.
[195:59.19]I was shooting wood and it exploded.
[196:03.38]I'm waiting for you, dude.
[196:04.76]Where are you?
[196:05.34]Three, two, one...
[196:20.64]Thank you.
[196:22.95]Alright, let's go for a swim.
[196:24.17]You can't kill me in here.
[196:28.35]You can't kill me in here.
[196:30.25]You can drown, probably.
[196:32.45]You look like Hugh Jackman.
[196:35.08]Who do you look like?
[196:36.56]Let me see your face.
[196:38.82]You look like X-Men 1 Hugh Jackman.
[196:43.34]Oh, by the way, we were both drowning.
[196:44.50]The fish.
[196:45.34]Oh, yeah, I'm drowning.
[196:48.26]Why did I just take... Oh, that thing just bit the shit out of you.
[196:51.54]I know, I've got two whole health bars missing now.
[196:54.38]That's all, he just wanted to bite you a couple times, like, yeah.
[196:59.10]Jesus Christ!
[197:04.29]Are you gonna get him?
[197:05.51]He's fucking murdering me!
[197:08.99]There's so much blood around you.
[197:12.03]Oh my god!
[197:13.86]This game is crazy!
[197:15.42]Oh, hold on.
[197:16.38]Was that alligator just biting you?
[197:17.66]Pull the little twig out of your finger.
[197:20.73]I just got demon fish skin.
[197:23.49]Let's go find more wild, crazy animals.
[197:27.85]What are we gonna find next in this wild and crazy world?
[197:30.83]An elephant.
[197:33.49]Hello, most majestic of all beasts.
[197:35.76]Where's like the pet command?
[197:37.88]How do I pet him?
[197:39.82]Uh, that's in the other Far Cry game, Far Cry Primal.
[197:42.92]Oh.
[197:45.69]Alright, there's another elephant.
[197:46.77]Let's go back to the car.
[197:48.34]Hey, I found an animal.
[197:51.92]Found some animals.
[197:52.44]Dude, there's like a couple of foxes.
[198:00.18]Okay, they're not happy.
[198:02.68]I think they're just like angry that we're over here looking at them.
[198:05.24]Yeah.
[198:05.62]They're just showing us tricks, lookit.
[198:06.86]Alright, up, up.
[198:08.72]Okay, his trick hurts.
[198:11.16]The trick still really hurts.
[198:12.52]The trick hurts you, not me.
[198:15.24]That's the whole trick.
[198:17.10]There's more.
[198:22.66]Why can't we ride one of these?
[198:23.68]Because they're so little.
[198:27.00]We're like three times their size.
[198:29.22]What is this elephant doing in the water?
[198:30.59]This elephant's in the water.
[198:33.69]They just take like a bath?
[198:35.91]That's so cool.
[198:36.67]Oh, that's awesome.
[198:37.55]That's so cool.
[198:38.19]Oh, he's spraying himself and everything?
[198:44.19]Cool.
[198:45.99]Elephants are so cool.
[198:47.59]I know.
[198:47.91]They're great at killing people.
[198:53.70]I'm going to get the car.
[198:59.92]I'm a swimming elephant.
[199:01.36]Hold on, I gotta get the aetheral.
[199:04.28]Gonna make some potions later with that.
[199:05.40]This car is about to explode by the way.
[199:11.28]Hang on, where are you?
[199:12.28]Repairing the car.
[199:15.13]Alright.
[199:15.79]You keep doing that.
[199:16.53]It's almost done.
[199:20.33]You just keep on repairing that there car.
[199:30.40]Uh, yes.
[199:31.76]You... You just... You ruined it, didn't you?
[199:36.30]No, we can't even drive that thing.
[199:38.40]It's fine.
[199:39.06]It's fine.
[199:40.45]We can't even get in that now.
[199:42.57]It's fine.
[199:43.19]Uh-oh.
[199:45.81]Making noise.
[199:50.59]You can actually drive it still.
[199:51.67]Yeah, it's a hovercraft.
[199:53.71]Oh, wow.
[199:54.07]Okay, take us on an adventure.
[199:55.19]Alright, we're going on a water rafting adventure.
[200:00.05]Down the river.
[200:01.57]Down the river.
[200:02.63]And if you shoot me in the back of the head, I swear.
[200:04.49]I'm not going to shoot you.
[200:08.49]Throw a knife at the back of my head, apparently.
[200:13.71]Hope you run out of knives.
[200:15.61]I probably will.
[200:16.29]I don't have very many.
[200:19.32]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[200:21.54]Oh, no, no.
[200:23.34]Jet ski.
[200:23.86]Not as cool as a hovercraft.
[200:26.26]Ooh, that is cool.
[200:27.10]I want it.
[200:33.54]I'm gonna be way faster than you now, man.
[200:34.68]The boat car.
[200:35.26]You probably are.
[200:35.94]I mean, I'm just in a lo- Oh, wow.
[200:37.62]Where are we?
[200:38.04]Look at this show off.
[200:39.32]Okay, we could- There's a lot of random places to go.
[200:42.14]Let's just go this way.
[200:43.40]You may be faster than me, but can you do this?
[200:53.91]That's a bunch of deer!
[200:55.77]You actually did that.
[200:57.23]I'm fine.
[200:57.53]I'm fine.
[200:57.87]You brought that thing all the way through.
[200:59.45]You, like, ran through a guy's house.
[201:01.13]No, I went through a pack of deer.
[201:07.21]Dude, it's like wave race all over again.
[201:11.99]Another fishing boat.
[201:13.37]Is there a waterfall?
[201:14.92]Oh, we got a little thing over here.
[201:20.20]We got a thing over here.
[201:25.78]What's the thing?
[201:26.24]I don't know.
[201:28.56]I'm going to come investigate.
[201:30.80]Rip this poster down.
[201:31.62]Get this propaganda out of here.
[201:32.60]I mean, it said that there was like a question mark over here.
[201:39.41]This is so difficult to steer, by the way.
[201:43.09]As I imagine a hovercraft in real life would be.
[201:50.85]Reload.
[201:51.21]Oh, God.
[201:51.57]Reload while sprinting.
[201:52.37]Yes, absolutely.
[201:54.52]I picked that one too.
[201:55.28]That's so important.
[201:58.80]Um, okay.
[202:01.79]I'm fine.
[202:02.31]I think you are stuck now.
[202:03.59]I think you've finally ruined it all.
[202:05.21]No.
[202:05.77]What if I just pop the tires?
[202:08.35]Oh, you hurt me very badly.
[202:11.94]I have to heal myself.
[202:13.94]I'm finding a bunch of glass out of my hand.
[202:16.82]I'm trying to get this shit out of the way for you.
[202:18.42]I'm free!
[202:22.82]You're free to do what you want.
[202:26.26]And that's to run us into another fence.
[202:27.36]I'll take care of that fence for you.
[202:28.46]Don't worry.
[202:31.16]Thanks, Hugh Jackman.
[202:32.05]I appreciate that.
[202:32.75]Alright, let's go.
[202:33.91]Take us down the river.
[202:35.83]I'm inside.
[202:40.69]Alright, I'm opening the map.
[202:42.52]I see shipping company.
[202:44.90]See that one down there?
[202:45.94]The flag, the outpost.
[202:47.14]Roach and Brick.
[202:49.82]Roach and Brick shipping company.
[202:51.24]You know what I see?
[202:55.54]Oh, you do see that.
[202:56.46]That is correct.
[202:57.02]That is something to see.
[202:59.06]Which do you like better, hovercraft or chopper?
[203:02.25]Chopper, for sure.
[203:06.53]I'll miss you, car boat.
[203:12.33]I'll miss you.
[203:12.93]Look at this scenic view.
[203:16.65]Where are we going?
[203:18.70]Over here.
[203:20.16]We'll go this way.
[203:21.68]Wherever your heart desires.
[203:23.26]We're going this way.
[203:27.26]Are you still attached?
[203:28.60]Oh, yeah.
[203:29.34]I'm about to swing through a bunch of trees, though.
[203:31.17]Okay.
[203:31.97]Clear the trees.
[203:33.13]Look at those beautiful mountains.
[203:34.13]You just did like a Super Mario super jump over everything.
[203:38.41]The swings are getting progressively bigger.
[203:40.91]I'm about to do a loop-the-loop over the top of the hill.
[203:43.53]Oh, that's a tree.
[203:44.71]You smashed the tree?
[203:45.45]Yeah, I did smash the tree, but I'm still alive.
[203:48.09]You still... Are you un-attached still?
[203:50.45]No, I'm not attached.
[203:53.81]I'll wait for you.
[203:58.48]I'm gonna fix my hand.
[204:02.01]Ow.
[204:02.15]Thanks a lot, Nolander, for the subscription.
[204:04.25]Welcome, dude.
[204:06.17]Okay, I'm going.
[204:06.87]Alright, you're gonna have to pull up a little bit more, because we're, like, going, like, right here.
[204:16.26]Go up as high as you can.
[204:18.70]I'm going to try to swing you around.
[204:21.69]Oh.
[204:21.83]Whoa.
[204:25.32]I need like a special belt for this kind of maneuver.
[204:27.62]I want to like really just get you swinging.
[204:30.04]There you are.
[204:37.49]Get a little lower for maximum swingage.
[204:39.57]Alright.
[204:40.81]I think we have to liberate this place later.
[204:41.87]It detached me.
[204:43.03]And now I'm dead.
[204:44.89]Can't go too low.
[204:45.99]How low can you go?
[204:47.47]I'm ready to destroy this place.
[204:56.95]Hold on, I'm pulling her in!
[204:58.52]Ah!
[204:58.58]Oh, shit!
[205:05.18]Uh, you dead?

[205:46.50]Yeah, really try to swing me.
[205:47.76]I'm gonna drop a shitload.
[205:51.02]You can't.
[205:51.42]If you drop too far, you'll just fall.

[206:41.71]You got me and I lied back and just floated to the Earth.
[206:48.57]I'm about to puke.
[206:51.03]I'm about to puke.
[206:55.51]Alright, get us up there real high.
[206:57.23]Let's go.
[206:57.69]Let's do the mission.
[206:58.87]Okay.
[206:59.53]You don't want to hang?
[207:01.99]No, I don't want to hang.
[207:03.31]I think we might make both of our chats throw up.
[207:09.13]I don't know where the mission is.
[207:10.35]Where are we going?
[207:11.29]If I jump out and then grapple, it'll be like a really cool sick move.
[207:15.82]Alright, we're going to this... I'm going to try this.
[207:19.46]I'm going to jump out and try to grapple.
[207:22.37]Go up a lot higher.
[207:23.15]Yeah, let's go over the water so you don't insta-die.
[207:26.77]Well, I think I am going to die no matter what, right?
[207:29.05]No, I think water you'll be safe.
[207:31.25]So the goal here is jump out, grab hold, swing.
[207:35.30]Here we go.
[207:36.46]Ready?
[207:36.68]Let's straighten it out a little.
[207:45.50]Okay, that would have worked.
[207:46.94]It would have worked.
[207:48.66]Yeah, it didn't happen.
[207:52.17]It was gonna work.
[207:52.63]Alright, now I can grab you now.
[207:56.75]Just come down close enough.
[207:57.63]That actually worked.
[207:59.98]I don't think you can be in the water.
[208:00.94]You don't think so?
[208:03.44]Come down closer.
[208:05.96]No, I can't.
[208:06.46]You're right.
[208:07.18]Shit!
[208:11.57]You know, what if... What if I get that while you're descending and I pull up really fast?
[208:15.53]Or will I just fly up into the blades?
[208:22.90]Alright, I'm on.
[208:26.82]Here he comes once again.
[208:33.12]It looks like I'm lassoing you.
[208:34.96]I'm swinging you around.
[208:36.22]Okay.
[208:39.94]Alright.
[208:40.68]I'm going to keep the camera here.
[208:44.56]Oh, there he goes.
[208:46.24]You got me with the blades.
[208:48.30]Okay.
[208:50.73]Oh, why are we on fire?
[209:01.50]It seriously looked like I like it threw a rope on you and was swinging you around like a toy
[209:12.66]Oh, that's so dumb.
[209:13.76]That's like thousands of pounds.
[209:15.80]No, you can't do that shit.
[209:18.20]Oh, my face hurts.
[209:19.73]That's so funny.
[209:21.91]That is so funny.
[209:25.15]If I keep the camera steady enough... I still don't understand.
[209:27.97]Do that again.
[209:28.55]I gotta keep that steady enough.
[209:29.75]I don't even know what I did.
[209:36.28]You think you can fuck with me?
[209:38.95]I am a god.
[209:40.43]You're gonna try to take off on my launch pad?
[209:42.75]No, I didn't think so.
[209:44.39]I'm a fucking mutant.
[209:45.69]I'm one of the strongest mutants.
[209:49.08]You fucking piece of shit.
[209:50.94]I'll just keep pulling you down to Earth.
[209:54.66]Alright, let's go.
[210:03.67]My helicopter won't stop beeping at me.
[210:07.31]Okay, there.
[210:08.77]What did you do this time?
[210:10.45]It's just funny looking.
[210:12.92]How did you die is what I'm asking.
[210:14.80]If I pull myself up fast enough, I pull my head up into the blades.
[210:21.64]Okay, where are we actually going?
[210:23.70]I don't know.
[210:24.04]We're supposed to liberate this bell tower.
[210:28.32]I'm going to find an outpost.
[210:29.42]This one says easy.
[210:30.02]Straight ahead, right there.
[210:33.29]Let's do the bell tower.
[210:34.45]That's not an outpost.
[210:35.99]That's just a bell tower.
[210:37.13]Who cares about that?
[210:39.81]We're going this way.
[210:42.37]I mean, eventually.
[210:43.19]Alright, I'll take us to the action.
[210:52.83]Wait, this guy's down there?
[210:53.63]Screw those guys.
[210:55.92]There's guys everywhere.
[210:56.74]Just throwing rocks.
[211:05.05]Alright, you ready?
[211:07.68]Thanks a lot, Buttery Raven.
[211:08.72]Welcome, dude.
[211:10.46]Thanks for subbing.
[211:11.30]Because we're here.
[211:12.32]I'm ready.
[211:15.46]Well, we're here.
[211:16.14]I can't drop from this far.
[211:18.18]Well, you can shoot from there.
[211:20.09]You want me to shoot from here?
[211:20.97]No way I'm going to hit a person.
[211:23.25]Yeah.
[211:23.67]You're spinning around so much, dude.
[211:25.61]Landing.
[211:27.75]Landing.
[211:28.11]I landed.
[211:29.07]Alright, good.
[211:30.65]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[211:33.20]Why am I dying, though?
[211:37.82]I shot the explosive.
[211:38.44]We're good.
[211:42.32]Reinforcements?
[211:42.74]I think we're going to liberate this place.
[211:48.20]Oh my gosh.
[211:49.10]Give me my weapons.
[211:50.68]Molotovs.
[211:52.55]I'm tired of holding down the control button to heal permanently.
[211:56.23]Watch out.
[211:57.69]They got a car.
[212:00.81]Great.
[212:00.95]There was one bullet in that gun.
[212:06.74]Where is this guy?
[212:07.32]Oh, he's down here.
[212:13.66]I shot that guy like 500 times and he's still alive.
[212:16.94]Whoa!
[212:19.36]They do know how to throw grenades up here.
[212:22.65]Can I not do like a special takedown on this guy?
[212:25.05]Only when they don't know you're there.
[212:26.31]Oh, okay.
[212:28.03]Unless you unlock the perk.
[212:29.69]Get the perk!
[212:31.01]Get those perks, man.
[212:31.89]Alright, I'm good.
[212:37.62]I'm currently sneaking.
[212:40.84]Yeah, that was like an A-plus sneak dive right there.
[212:42.98]I don't know if you saw that or not, dude.
[212:47.03]Like this?
[212:48.47]Nice.
[212:49.25]Good work.
[212:59.75]Nice.
[213:00.83]Open the door.
[213:01.23]I need one more.
[213:03.55]Can you get him?
[213:04.96]I got one guy.
[213:05.54]Make sure you got him.
[213:06.22]You got him.
[213:07.42]Oh, he's definitely dead.
[213:09.62]That guy's not dead.
[213:10.70]He's dead.
[213:11.00]There's one dude left over here.
[213:16.59]We did it.
[213:17.69]Good work.
[213:20.09]We actually did a mission.
[213:22.15]Hey, what time did the stream go down?
[213:24.41]Anyone remember when it was?
[213:26.84]I've been streaming for like... I've been live for three hours.
[213:29.70]So... It went down like two hours ago?
[213:37.79]So what time is it?
[213:38.43]Like midnight for me?
[213:39.31]Like 1150?
[213:41.07]Two hours ago.
[213:42.57]So like what?
[213:43.01]Like 10 o'clock or so?
[213:44.43]Is this guy on a car?
[213:45.55]Is there another invisible?
[213:46.45]Why are these guys floating?
[213:49.03]Floating?
[213:50.35]Yeah, these guys are flying.
[213:51.34]This guy is flying.
[213:52.64]Show me.
[213:53.40]This guy right here is flying.
[213:55.76]That person is steadily walking downwards back towards the Earth.
[213:58.98]She's walking at a very nice pace.
[214:00.34]Now she's got her gun out, dude.
[214:01.28]I don't think you want to fuck with this person.
[214:04.85]Absolutely floating.
[214:06.69]Her foot is level with theirs.
[214:09.47]What are these people doing?
[214:10.15]Why are there random GTA pedestrians?
[214:15.73]And random GTA drivers?
[214:25.36]They're having a lot of trouble right now.
[214:32.65]Get out of there.
[214:34.72]So, what, like 10 o'clock or so?
[214:35.82]I'm just trying to, like, let them know when it stopped.
[214:43.94]What the hell?
[214:46.04]Don't scare me like that.
[214:48.00]I'm texting somebody.
[214:49.04]Ugh.
[214:52.61]Surprise.
[215:17.66]Alright.
[215:18.56]Do we have a mission for this person?
[215:20.24]An assassination mission?
[215:22.98]I think by liberating the outpost we unlocked like three mini activities.
[215:33.66]We gotta hitman this.
[215:34.40]We gotta do like a hitman thing.
[215:35.46]Uh-huh.
[215:36.22]Uh-huh.
[215:36.72]Alright, I'm getting in.
[215:37.42]Get in.
[215:37.98]Same car?
[215:38.58]Different cars?
[215:39.40]Same car.
[215:40.38]Make it easier.
[215:42.26]Wait a second.
[215:42.64]I kinda need to refill my ammo.
[215:43.86]Do you mind if we like go inside real quick and buy... Maybe we can buy guns.
[215:46.82]Yeah, we can buy some new guns.
[215:48.25]Tired of using the same AK.
[215:50.71]Do me a favor and just ram this car right now.
[215:53.65]Uh... This one that I'm in front of?
[215:57.48]Okay.
[215:58.82]Go on.
[215:59.20]Yeah, just drive as fast as you can across the road into this person.
[216:07.11]Oh, what?
[216:07.61]No.
[216:07.93]Never mind.
[216:08.45]Joke's over.
[216:11.13]Fun's over.
[216:14.77]Maybe she'll drive now.
[216:18.42]Go.
[216:19.74]Fine.
[216:20.14]Never mind.
[216:24.25]No, she's locked in.
[216:26.25]Wow, how am I still standing on here?
[216:30.07]Just keep driving like this.
[216:31.61]This works.
[216:38.92]Take us on a mission.
[216:39.76]How am I still here?
[216:41.98]This should not work.
[216:43.08]This doesn't work.
[216:45.57]I don't know where I'm at.
[216:46.45]I'm just driving until I find a mission.
[216:48.67]That's a good idea.
[216:53.60]Just standing up in the back.
[216:56.32]I'll pre-order now.
[216:59.38]Can I get on the top of the car?
[217:02.61]Easy, easy.
[217:05.59]They're in the way.
[217:07.23]This music is perfect, dude.
[217:09.11]Is the mission the complete other direction?
[217:10.89]It is.
[217:17.74]Alright, come on.
[217:18.36]Get back on.
[217:19.56]I'm trying.
[217:19.96]Can I push you over?
[217:22.52]Whoa, that worked.
[217:23.56]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[217:26.29]Hold on.
[217:28.93]Okay, go.
[217:34.59]This is so perfect.
[217:37.31]Until you run into something.
[217:43.03]I was still on.
[217:43.79]Wow, that's so crazy.
[217:45.68]The car just auto-flipped.
[217:48.94]I see it.
[217:49.62]It's here.
[217:50.42]Wait.
[217:52.30]There's a crazy guy shooting at us.
[217:55.08]What?
[217:55.48]I don't have any bullets in that gun.
[217:59.18]There's no one there.
[218:03.34]What are you throwing?
[218:04.56]Rocks?
[218:05.98]Fuck!
[218:06.68]Pick me up.
[218:08.46]What?
[218:09.16]Pick me up before this guy shoots you to death.
[218:13.50]Then we have to throw rocks at him.
[218:15.48]I don't even see him.
[218:16.26]He's not there.
[218:17.30]It's another invisible guy.
[218:35.84]Come closer so I can cut your- HEY!
[218:38.94]What are these people doing?
[218:45.68]What are you doing?
[218:47.44]Why?
[219:06.62]Why did that happen?
[219:09.48]Oh, my face.
[219:11.32]Why?
[219:11.78]I need a new gun.
[219:15.97]She just turned and just fucking smashed me.
[219:20.79]For no reason at all.
[219:22.40]There was no reason for that to happen.
[219:26.27]She slid down and said she was going to cut the guy's dick off.
[219:29.05]And then she turned and just started smashing me and killed me.
[219:31.97]Yeah.
[219:33.23]No, you're right.
[219:34.03]No, that absolutely happened.
[219:36.21]Did you do something odd to make her turn and start shooting me?
[219:40.51]Well, do you really want to know?
[219:44.08]Do I?
[219:44.86]Can we sleep in the same bed?
[219:46.12]I just threw a bunch of rocks at her until she turned around.
[219:53.57]Okay, I don't want to alarm you, Etalyx, but when we open this door... Guy's just out here.
[220:02.46]What?
[220:04.53]I thought we took this outpost already.
[220:06.39]This is ours.
[220:06.97]This is our house.
[220:09.83]I'm not shooting the gun.
[220:13.26]I did not just shoot the gun.
[220:14.36]I swear to God.
[220:14.96]I promise you.
[220:15.74]I promise I didn't click.
[220:17.89]I can guarantee you I did not just shoot that guy.
[220:20.29]The game felt so bad that we sucked so bad it shot that guy for us.
[220:23.19]I do suck.
[220:24.01]I just died to one single person.
[220:28.47]Ugh, that's funny.
[220:35.82]Alright, Tal.
[220:36.24]Does this car exist?
[220:40.04]Yeah.
[220:40.88]Alright, good.
[220:41.24]Get in.
[220:49.84]Close enough, right?
[220:50.80]Close enough.
[220:51.26]Yeah, this is what I was doing.
[220:52.32]I'm fine.
[221:00.61]Unbelievable.
[221:02.05]Unbelievable.
[221:03.03]I can actually repair your car from here.
[221:04.37]I'm actually upset about that.
[221:06.65]Repair tool unavailable while vehicle is moving.
[221:09.53]I'm actually not happy that that just happened.
[221:15.73]My car just crushed you between two trees.
[221:18.59]Nah, I'm fine.
[221:20.03]I'm great.
[221:20.63]I've never been better, actually.
[221:21.89]I can't see because you're literally in the front of me.
[221:24.85]I can't see a thing.
[221:29.72]Are we good now?
[221:30.26]Oh, we're good.
[221:31.92]No, we're not.
[221:32.62]There's a pole right there.
[221:38.13]Perfect.
[221:39.69]Alright.
[221:40.57]We gotta turn around.
[221:46.04]Make our way this way.
[221:53.25]Secretly, I'm hoping that a rhino just comes and smashes the car and you go flying.
[221:58.65]Can you put a waypoint where we're going?
[222:01.53]Uh, did we pick up, like, an assassination?
[222:03.59]Yeah, we did.
[222:04.17]It's blanking on the road right now.
[222:05.47]Did you get that yellow dot on the road?
[222:07.87]I did.
[222:23.41]I wanted to skip, but I think we have to go across the bridge.
[222:31.44]Why is this just tactical intervention again?
[222:36.58]Oh, nice.
[222:37.10]I'm not going to lie.
[222:37.64]I was trying to just dump you through the grate there.
[222:40.02]Oh.
[222:41.43]Well, on my screen, it just looked like you were going on a straightaway and suddenly veered hard to the right for no reason.
[222:47.58]I'm stuck on your car.
[222:48.60]I don't think you understand.
[222:49.38]I have the new invention in Far Cry 4, the glue shoes.
[222:53.88]You can't knock me off no matter how hard you try.
[222:56.19]So we're just driving straight into this guy's house and running him over?
[223:00.77]Presumably, unless he has hostages, that'll fail the mission.
[223:03.77]Alright, so he's on that island.
[223:15.65]Don't you fucking dare.
[223:21.24]No, come on.
[223:23.76]You did not.
[223:24.26]Now we have to do that again.
[223:25.66]You did not just do that again.
[223:28.00]You didn't do that.
[223:28.94]I finally figured it out.
[223:30.76]I've been trying to figure that out for so long.
[223:35.37]Oh, God.
[223:39.51]I still don't know what button it was.
[223:43.54]Okay, I got it.
[223:44.10]There we go.
[223:45.96]There it is.
[223:47.58]Alright.
[223:48.30]You are driving.
[223:54.20]How do I... I want to use the bow.
[223:56.12]Do I have to buy the bow?
[223:59.85]Put the gun down, lady.
[224:03.61]It's the same lady.
[224:05.51]Same one.
[224:05.95]Same psycho.
[224:20.13]Quick throw rocks at our talent hit her!
[224:25.50]Nooo Wait you got up Alright now we're both dead Okay When that rock hit her in the chest It was like Just thump God I wish you could kill somebody right in the head with a rock Oh that would be amazing yeah I want a bow and arrow too It's fun It is fun It's really tough though when you get a firefight
[224:59.32]Alright, buy ammo.
[225:02.84]Okay.
[225:03.60]Let's do it.
[225:08.15]We need more rocks.
[225:09.29]Alright, let's actually go to the mission.
[225:14.98]What do you say?
[225:17.90]I'll take it easy, Aerolus.
[225:20.02]Have fun in Skyrim.
[225:31.17]Alright.
[225:33.93]We gotta get in the water.
[225:35.47]No more C4ing.
[225:36.29]No more BS.
[225:37.74]Don't kill us.
[225:39.24]We need to take out a target.
[225:42.30]I know we're going in the water.
[225:43.18]I understand.
[225:43.66]It's okay.
[225:44.46]I'm just gonna ghost ride it.
[225:47.14]We're okay.
[225:48.88]Are we though?
[225:49.89]No.
[225:50.01]Just get out.
[225:50.93]We have to go right here.
[225:52.77]It's this island.
[225:54.25]Hang on.
[225:54.45]I want the flower.
[225:57.33]Term of strange addiction.
[226:07.40]Alright, equip the camera.
[226:08.96]You can hear, like, the intense music.
[226:09.76]Yeah, we gotta use it.
[226:10.24]This is a sneaky way, you know?
[226:11.30]If you wanna use the bow, you gotta do it right.
[226:13.01]Hang on, come here.
[226:19.70]Where do you think he is?
[226:21.38]Where is he?
[226:22.52]I think he might be over this way.
[226:24.77]His camera's already huge.
[226:27.29]This is an SLR DSLR 2.
[226:29.03]It's a Mach 4.
[226:30.81]I'm gonna go shoot some indie films with this camera.
[226:33.47]Be right back.
[226:35.48]Let's come film the guy.
[226:39.36]Alright, Alex, can you just go up and like sneak up and just videotape the guy like paparazzi?
[226:44.70]Okay, how close can you get to this guy in front of me as paparazzi?
[226:48.46]Just make sure you don't get caught.
[226:50.08]I won't.
[226:50.46]I'm sneaking around the side for optimal close range.
[226:55.51]It has to be the guy directly in front of you?
[226:57.31]This guy right in front of me.
[226:58.67]Oh, okay.
[226:59.03]Whoops.
[226:59.49]No, no, that's fine.
[227:00.81]Yeah, that guy's better.
[227:03.87]The guy that's like sitting there snoozing.
[227:21.53]That's so stupid.
[227:23.95]Make sure you survey the area.
[227:26.25]Get a couple of good pictures.
[227:28.41]There are some enemies over here.
[227:30.12]Snap, snap.
[227:31.32]Snap.
[227:31.58]Watch out for that guy.
[227:32.16]Snap him.
[227:33.02]Oh, shit.
[227:36.64]We have to be undetected?
[227:40.86]Oh, my God.
[227:41.67]Oh, my God.
[227:44.17]At least we're right here.
[227:51.31]Oh, this game already.
[227:52.21]I love this game.
[227:54.39]You're like sneaking up with a camera.
[227:56.45]We gotta survey the area.
[227:57.64]No, you're going the right way.
[228:00.02]Oh, he's just sleeping.
[228:03.12]He's like taking pictures of guys asleep.
[228:07.94]We can't be detected, remember.
[228:09.90]Okay, cannot be detected.
[228:11.72]Kill the commander without being detected.
[228:14.40]You got it.
[228:17.72]That means we have to be precise with our arrows.
[228:21.45]Hang on, I'll take some pictures.
[228:23.47]Be easier that way.
[228:24.31]Watch out, watch out!
[228:25.15]Okay, sneak.
[228:31.71]Alright, here's what you're gonna do.
[228:33.44]You're gonna shoot... I'm gonna make sure I get a good picture of it.
[228:35.42]You're gonna shoot the guy in the head that's sleeping.
[228:39.50]The guy in the head that's sleeping?
[228:40.96]The guy that is, like, snoozing right now.
[228:42.76]Okay.
[228:46.72]We're taking... taking...
[228:48.92]Who did they see?
[228:49.94]They're shooting you.
[228:50.78]They shot you.
[228:51.62]What?
[228:53.78]No way.
[228:55.60]You were kind of in plain view, to be fair.
[228:58.92]I mean, you weren't like really behind me.
[229:00.49]With a camera.
[229:01.77]You were like 20 feet away.
[229:03.37]Alright, hold on.
[229:04.07]Just hold the camera.
[229:05.17]I want to get my... My buddy's going to get a good shot of this.
[229:08.63]Okay, now I'm in a better spot.
[229:09.75]Right next to a tree.
[229:14.27]You got to get him right in his dome.
[229:16.15]Alright.
[229:18.40]It's going to be a tough shot.
[229:22.03]Arrow fall off.
[229:25.73]Where'd that hit him?
[229:26.69]Right in his head.
[229:27.93]Right in his neck.
[229:28.83]They see us.
[229:29.21]Back up.
[229:29.41]Back up.
[229:29.79]Get this guy.
[229:30.13]Get this guy.
[229:33.90]Shoot him too.
[229:34.28]It was a good shot.
[229:34.86]That was a really good shot, actually.
[229:42.04]I'm glad they keep putting us here.
[229:43.06]It's perfect.
[229:44.29]Yeah, right next to the... I'm on.
[229:51.40]I keep wanting it to, like, ramp up Just Cause style.
[229:54.16]I know, really.
[229:54.56]That's as far as it'll go.
[229:55.96]Okay, we need to... Let's actually do this mission now.
[229:58.18]Okay, we're actually gonna do it.
[230:00.50]Tag the enemies.
[230:01.36]Tag the guy.
[230:03.26]Get him.
[230:03.70]One, two, three.
[230:04.42]Alright, this guy to the left here.
[230:06.62]Where's our primary target?
[230:08.26]Uh, he's the commander over here to the left.
[230:09.64]We can probably just shoot him with the bow and arrow, and that's it.
[230:12.24]That guy right here to the left is the commander.
[230:14.50]Yeah.
[230:15.53]Okay, well, I trust you more than I trust myself.
[230:19.25]Get him.
[230:19.95]Wait, you're just going to film me?
[230:21.19]I'm going to film you.
[230:21.79]It's going to be like a documentary.
[230:23.47]The psycho that... Alright.
[230:25.15]You ready?
[230:25.81]I'm going to go in.
[230:26.81]He's already... He's gone.
[230:31.03]He's looking over at you.
[230:34.11]Oh, he's getting away.
[230:34.77]He's not getting away.
[230:36.89]He's just hanging out here, man.
[230:38.51]Isn't he this dude right here?
[230:39.83]They're going to see me.
[230:44.67]He's by the wishing well.
[230:48.98]He's walking by the stone steps.
[230:51.10]He's coming over to me.
[230:52.60]Etalyx.
[230:53.08]Just hide.
[230:53.80]Etalyx.
[230:55.16]Etalyx.
[230:59.21]He didn't see me.
[230:59.69]I'm good.
[231:02.97]He's gonna walk over to you right now.
[231:04.81]Oh, fuck.
[231:05.39]He's looking at me.
[231:07.25]Ah, why does he keep coming over here?
[231:10.71]He's hearing me.
[231:11.46]Etalyx, you gotta move now.
[231:13.12]Etalyx, now.
[231:14.16]Etalyx, now.
[231:14.98]Right now.
[231:15.66]Etalyx, right now.
[231:16.68]He's gonna see me in two seconds.
[231:18.66]Right now, Etalyx.
[231:19.20]You have to come over here right now.
[231:20.10]Now, now, now, now, now.
[231:21.01]Right now, right now.
[231:26.11]No!
[231:31.25]I was throwing rocks right on top of you the whole time.
[231:34.59]Are you serious?
[231:35.87]Yeah, I was making him go over to you.
[231:40.71]That's why he spontaneously decided you were so interesting.
[231:44.61]It's because I kept throwing rocks right on top of your position until he went over there.
[231:51.27]We're supposed to beat the mission.
[231:53.26]We have to beat...
[231:55.38]No, I'm running in.
[231:56.34]Alright, fuck you, Etalyx.
[231:57.62]I'm gonna kill this guy right now with one shot.
[232:00.42]Where is he?
[232:01.74]Where is he?
[232:02.24]Take out the binoculars.
[232:05.54]Okay.
[232:05.76]There he is.
[232:07.44]He's fucking dead.
[232:09.54]Got him.
[232:09.92]We win.
[232:10.98]Let's go home.
[232:11.44]That's all there was.
[232:13.47]Let's go home.
[232:14.55]Hang on, I'm shooting the other guys.
[232:18.57]We're gonna, like, steal his jewels.
[232:22.00]Hey, we won.
[232:22.40]Oh, my God.
[232:25.60]Wait, we have to hide him.
[232:26.78]No, we have to hide him now.
[232:28.44]Oh, of course.
[232:29.38]Hang on.
[232:29.80]Let me get one of my own buddies.
[232:31.58]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[232:32.24]Make sure there's nobody going to see him.
[232:33.12]We have to hide him in the statue thing.
[232:35.78]Where are we putting him?
[232:37.18]In the water?
[232:42.51]I don't understand.
[232:44.69]Wait, what?
[232:45.63]I think we just have to dump him over the cliff.
[232:48.79]Oh, my God.
[232:49.09]He's going to get eaten by the fishes.
[232:50.17]This is going to be crazy.
[232:51.38]It's okay if they find the rest of the body, just not this one.
[232:53.50]Oh, eat him.
[232:55.45]Eat him, he's fresh.
[232:58.21]Fresh!
[233:05.66]Eat him!
[233:09.84]I thought that was your body.
[233:12.33]No.
[233:12.99]That was just the body I was carrying.
[233:15.41]I thought you just did like a backflip into the water.
[233:17.89]Like that was you doing a trick.
[233:19.99]No.
[233:20.75]Oh my god.
[233:21.53]You fish suck.
[233:22.58]I wanna go fight.
[233:36.86]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[233:37.96]Abandon it.
[233:38.60]Seriously, run.
[233:39.58]Get out of the area.
[233:40.12]We're going to fail.
[233:41.82]Run, run, run.
[233:42.66]Are we really?
[233:43.24]Yes, we are.
[233:43.66]Get out of the area.
[233:45.01]Shoot him.
[233:45.91]Just shoot him.
[233:46.29]Get this guy off me.
[233:46.77]Hurry.
[233:48.33]Just wait to walk out of the circle.
[233:50.29]I'm stuck.
[233:51.90]No!
[233:52.06]I'm stuck!
[233:53.49]Where's my weapons?
[233:55.21]Oh, you're in the water now.
[233:56.27]Why are you in the water?
[233:57.15]We have to flee the area.
[233:57.99]I'm outside the police zone.
[233:59.95]Wait, are you dead?
[234:01.17]No, I'm fine.
[234:01.87]We have to just get out of the GTA, the cops can find you zone.
[234:05.12]Oh, I see.
[234:05.76]Okay.
[234:06.14]Get out of there.
[234:08.28]I'm choking to death.
[234:10.90]We did it.
[234:11.61]Thank God.
[234:14.82]Mission accomplished.
[234:15.74]Mission accomplished.
[234:16.48]We totally assassinated that guy.
[234:19.72]It was so ridiculous.
[234:21.30]Oh, we got 57,000 bits.
[234:22.16]Hey, I got a new skill.
[234:28.06]New skills.
[234:28.56]Ooh, cool.
[234:31.80]Maybe now I can crouch.
[234:32.85]I know it seems like ugly business, but every target...
[234:39.96]Get this guy.
[234:40.58]Come on.
[234:41.52]Etalyx, camera, camera, camera, camera.
[234:43.10]Shoot the headshot.
[234:43.64]Headshot this person on the boat.
[234:45.55]My whole screen is black and white because you just shot me with an arrow, so I had to kill myself three times.
[234:49.83]Headshot the guy on the boat.
[234:50.91]Guy on the boat.
[234:51.31]Headshot him.
[234:51.63]Alright, hang on.
[234:53.05]It's gonna be a tough shot.
[234:53.77]He's moving.
[234:54.57]Oh, he's moving.
[234:54.97]Alright, we're going.
[234:56.45]He's about to run into an elephant.
[235:00.02]Whoops.
[235:00.44]Oh, good shot.
[235:01.04]Nice drop.
[235:02.36]Good work.
[235:05.78]What are you shooting at?
[235:08.68]The arrows don't drop as much.
[235:11.10]Oh boy.
[235:12.08]This is on camera.
[235:16.89]I got him!
[235:17.71]Did you get a double?
[235:21.63]I didn't realize that the arrows have no drop anymore.
[235:24.49]They're just like... You shot the first one into the ground.
[235:26.88]That's because I didn't hold down left trigger.
[235:35.85]One of my arrows back.
[235:37.41]Thanks a lot, Oppo099.
[235:38.89]Oppo, Oppo, thanks for nine.
[235:40.21]Seven months, I thought it was nine.
[235:43.05]Welcome back, dude.
[235:43.57]Thanks a lot.
[235:47.52]Is this guy still alive?
[235:48.98]Who?
[235:49.28]Just cowering on the boat.
[235:51.84]Oh, I thought you actually... Okay, well, they can stay.
[235:53.80]Just drive.
[235:54.42]Alright, where are we going?
[235:57.78]No, no, just go really fast.
[236:01.55]This isn't really a really fast boat.
[236:04.37]Yeah, this person, I guess, is just still hanging out here.
[236:08.15]They're sitting in a really odd spot, too.
[236:11.98]Like, they're about to jump out of the boat.
[236:15.46]But they don't want to.
[236:17.34]Oh, she's not happy with that.
[236:24.02]What are they carrying?
[236:24.60]Are these, like, dead bodies?
[236:26.50]They got a bunch of sacks.
[236:32.84]Probably like fishing bait or something.
[236:34.83]I don't know.
[236:37.29]Okay, throwing these in the air.
[236:39.95]I'm throwing them as far forward as I can and they're just coming back and hitting us.
[236:46.46]We're faster than the rocks.
[236:49.92]I think there's something here.
[236:52.34]Something here.
[236:55.45]Something here.
[236:58.61]They've already spotted us, but, uh... She was... Okay.
[237:01.86]I thought she just sunk into the Earth.
[237:03.80]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[237:04.82]No, no, don't run into him.
[237:10.73]Why is she doing that?
[237:12.39]Where is she going?
[237:13.41]She's running directly into them.
[237:15.81]I'm following her.
[237:18.88]Oh fuck, he's here.
[237:20.26]Okay, he's too stupid.
[237:21.14]It's okay.
[237:22.38]No, he's throwing knives at me now.
[237:24.47]You kidding me?
[237:25.97]Nice, nice work.
[237:27.65]Where'd she go?
[237:28.59]Wait, are you the camera guy again?
[237:29.71]I'm the camera guy.
[237:30.87]Okay.
[237:31.47]There's so many people here.
[237:33.45]There's so- I'm not gonna- I gotta hide behind the boat.
[237:35.77]They're shooting like flaming arrows.
[237:37.91]Alright, this is a bow and arrow fight if I've ever seen one.
[237:47.66]What?
[237:47.84]Did you just throw fire on me?
[237:50.04]No, that guy's shooting... Okay, you're dead.
[237:53.62]I can't revive you.
[237:54.26]Why can I not revive you?
[237:55.60]I don't know.
[237:57.22]I burned.
[238:00.08]What are they doing?
[238:02.44]Boat exploded.
[238:03.24]Game over.
[238:04.60]No, not game over.
[238:06.02]What?
[238:06.78]How the hell?
[238:08.12]I don't know.
[238:12.78]They can't see me.
[238:13.22]I'm fine.
[238:15.03]And you're back.
[238:15.41]Good thing I had a spawn point for you.
[238:16.88]Squad, battlefield, spawn.
[238:17.74]Got him.
[238:25.66]This is an awful cover.
[238:27.08]Yeah, it really is.
[238:27.88]It's like a shitty raft.
[238:30.47]It's just a little balloon raft.
[238:34.23]Shoot them in the face.
[238:35.39]Shoot them in the face.
[238:39.61]Whoops.
[238:39.87]I didn't know you were gonna burn that guy.
[238:41.39]Spam.
[238:42.15]Oh, I'm on fire.
[238:45.65]I blew up something over there.
[238:48.03]Let me help you.
[238:48.55]Are you okay?
[238:48.83]Oh, you can't.
[238:50.17]I just magically respawned.
[238:51.49]I don't... Okay.
[238:56.13]Going in.
[238:57.52]Right behind you.
[238:58.30]Hold on.
[238:58.80]My finger hurt.
[238:59.56]I had to pull it for a second.
[239:01.88]Me too.
[239:02.46]This way.
[239:02.68]This way.
[239:04.32]Watch out.
[239:07.12]Oh, goodness.
[239:08.08]That was a good job.
[239:10.30]There's another one.
[239:12.04]Can I pull?
[239:12.36]I gotta pull that arrow out.
[239:15.22]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[239:16.78]Talon.
[239:19.76]Somebody sticks in my body.
[239:21.12]Hold on.
[239:23.28]Hold on.
[239:23.60]Oh, I'm down.
[239:24.32]I'm down.
[239:24.94]My finger hurts.
[239:26.32]Oh, shit.
[239:26.62]My finger.
[239:27.40]Oh, my finger hurts again.
[239:28.48]I dislocated my thumb for a third time.
[239:31.88]Ow.
[239:38.03]That's so funny.
[239:41.08]I'm just crawling towards a mad elephant now.
[239:44.30]There's an elephant over there?
[239:48.16]Help.
[239:49.20]Help me.
[239:49.88]Get up!
[239:51.97]Get up!
[239:52.37]Get up!
[239:52.89]Get up!
[239:53.31]Oh my gosh.
[239:55.73]Why is he mad at us?
[239:56.55]We didn't do anything.
[240:02.29]Are you trying to ride him?
[240:02.93]I think he's too mad for you to ride.
[240:06.23]He's never too mad.
[240:07.27]They're docile creatures at heart.
[240:09.09]Alright, now go cause a complete rampage so we can get to the top.
[240:11.77]You just treat them with respect.
[240:16.49]Watch out!
[240:16.77]I almost ran you over.
[240:19.45]Don't kill me.
[240:20.95]There's only like one guy left.
[240:22.32]There's only one guy down here.
[240:28.32]Oh, he knows.
[240:28.90]He knows that he can lose you in the water.
[240:31.36]You didn't even get him.
[240:34.96]Okay.
[240:36.68]Okay.
[240:38.10]Okay.
[240:39.00]Okay.
[240:40.40]You threw him in the air.
[240:42.30]He's gone.
[240:42.60]Do you see this?
[240:44.82]Who's driving this car?
[240:46.36]What's going on?
[240:48.19]What car?
[240:49.91]Why am I off the elephant?
[240:52.19]I don't know.
[240:54.19]What?
[240:55.41]You spiked him into the ground like a volleyball, then you threw him into the air and he was gone.
[241:00.10]That was insane.
[241:02.50]I don't know.
[241:03.84]What...
[241:05.92]Craft a syringe.
[241:10.90]Thanks a lot, Barbara and Mojo, too.
[241:12.34]I want to heal.
[241:14.65]And Better Mix Master, thanks for eight months.
[241:16.27]What kind of tea do I drink?
[241:17.29]Green tea.
[241:19.01]Green tea is my favorite tea.
[241:21.42]And then if it's not green, it's going to be red.
[241:23.08]Roibos.
[241:24.92]Roibos.
[241:26.26]I don't know.
[241:28.30]Sorry, I was having a discussion.
[241:30.26]Oh.
[241:30.82]Outpost master, liberate the outpost by killing... Wait, what?
[241:34.89]Didn't we just do this?
[241:36.49]What's going on?
[241:36.89]Where are we going?
[241:41.11]I don't know.
[241:41.65]I just teleported.
[241:42.27]I need to pick a skill real quick, though.
[241:43.61]Hang on.
[241:43.81]Here, take some ammo.
[241:46.57]Oh, thanks.
[241:47.05]During outpost master, kills made using bait or guns for hire will not contribute.
[241:52.02]You think we just have to kill things?
[241:56.47]Current objective.
[241:58.11]Honest to God, I just seriously felt that's actually pretty damn high.
[242:01.43]Yeah, that's real high.
[242:02.55]You're going to get hurt.
[242:04.29]That would hurt IRL.
[242:05.43]Alright, so we're not allowed to basically kill people with animals for free like you would normally in the game.
[242:10.98]We have to get points.
[242:12.44]Watch out.
[242:12.88]They're already here.
[242:13.70]They're right there.
[242:15.48]We're supposed to take over this outpost again.
[242:17.54]It's like a challenge.
[242:18.52]Oh, it's challenge mode.
[242:19.19]This is challenge mode.
[242:20.13]Yeah, got it.
[242:23.99]Did you see that?
[242:25.37]Don't use the animals.
[242:26.57]Don't use the elephant.
[242:27.23]Did you see that one?
[242:28.05]I hope you saw that.
[242:29.43]No.
[242:29.51]I've been found.
[242:30.29]Did you see that one?
[242:31.47]We've been found.
[242:31.99]Did you see that one?
[242:33.54]I did, yes.
[242:43.58]I just lost 100% of my health.
[242:44.56]Where?
[242:44.86]Where?
[242:48.57]Where?
[242:48.89]Where?
[242:49.43]Where?
[242:56.93]Nice work.
[242:57.89]Keep it up.
[242:59.05]Oh, no.
[242:59.31]We used the elephant.
[243:00.21]This guy's calling reinforcements.
[243:02.27]We've got to destroy the node.
[243:05.46]I've got to go in there and I've got to fuck with the Comcast node.
[243:10.40]There's so much fire.
[243:11.64]Put it out.
[243:12.94]Ow.
[243:14.24]Ow.
[243:14.48]Ow.
[243:16.16]We burned the building, though.
[243:17.82]Yep.
[243:20.35]Look at that score.
[243:21.45]One billion points.
[243:23.37]We can do this.
[243:23.91]Let's do the Chaos Emerald Master, whatever we have to do.
[243:27.03]Alright, let's do it like super stealth master way.
[243:30.39]Alright, fine.
[243:31.43]So where's your melee weapon?
[243:32.91]Do we have to buy one, didn't we?
[243:34.41]Do you have a bow?
[243:36.21]I have a bow.
[243:37.31]There you go.
[243:37.65]Alright.
[243:46.26]Slick.
[243:47.40]Real slick.
[243:49.54]Which guy are you going for?
[243:50.92]First, let's tag some people.
[243:51.68]I'm trying to mark them.
[243:52.46]Yeah, I'm trying to mark them first.
[243:57.24]I only see like two people.
[243:59.20]Yeah, me too.
[243:59.92]How did we lose this?
[244:02.52]There's other guys on the other side of that building to the left.
[244:05.20]This guy straight ahead with the arrows?
[244:07.73]Yep.
[244:08.59]I'm gonna hit this guy right in the face.
[244:09.75]I'm gonna get this guy in the building to the right.
[244:11.57]I missed.
[244:14.61]Oh boy.
[244:15.27]I missed again.
[244:16.43]Good luck.
[244:16.91]Well, super stealth.
[244:18.31]Real great.
[244:19.03]I'm pretty good at stealth.
[244:20.66]Don't worry.
[244:21.46]Keep this guy distracted.
[244:23.08]Keep this guy distracted.
[244:23.74]Just keep him looking at you.
[244:26.07]I can only do that for another... There we go.
[244:30.19]Son of a bitch.
[244:31.61]We need to hide the body now.
[244:32.35]I'm going to throw him in the water.
[244:35.83]Thank you.
[244:36.19]Thank you for giving me the vintage porn, by the way.
[244:37.80]I appreciate it, Tal.
[244:41.96]What?
[244:42.26]You just did that, didn't you?
[244:43.40]No, I did not.
[244:44.72]There was a guy.
[244:45.88]See this body right here?
[244:47.82]The ninja?
[244:55.92]Goodness.
[245:00.30]I'm distracting this guy.
[245:01.14]Did you just, like, break that guy's neck?
[245:07.44]I don't know.
[245:07.82]I have no idea.
[245:08.34]Watch out for the fire.
[245:09.38]The fire is getting ever closer to you.
[245:11.20]I cannot pick you up.
[245:11.96]You can't pick me up?
[245:13.03]Get me out of this fire.
[245:14.19]Go to the water.
[245:14.83]Quick.
[245:15.93]Douse myself in the water.
[245:17.57]Get in the water.
[245:18.89]I'm dead.
[245:19.15]I still cannot pick you up.
[245:20.53]Apparently, me getting to the water killed me.
[245:23.89]Alright.
[245:24.39]17 seconds.
[245:24.69]Stay alive.
[245:27.35]I'm trying.
[245:28.25]That's a long time, you have to understand.
[245:29.99]Here comes a guy in a car.
[245:35.50]Truck!
[245:37.34]Three seconds.
[245:39.92]What was that?
[245:41.74]What?
[245:43.36]Somebody dropped a mortar.
[245:45.56]They really are dropping bombs on us.
[245:48.57]Oh my gosh.
[245:49.41]Who's calling in the reinforcements here to drop these nukes?
[245:53.47]Alright, I'm going to mark some people.
[245:56.39]I don't think they know where I am.
[245:58.73]No, they don't know where we are.
[246:00.55]This guy?
[246:00.93]Okay, this guy frantically is coming up.
[246:03.25]He absolutely knows where he is.
[246:06.79]You just found me!
[246:08.43]I was trying to get him.
[246:10.83]I was trying to get him.
[246:13.29]Alright, let's see how they like this.
[246:14.49]Yeah, it is one of your brethren.
[246:19.09]Alright, elephant's doing a lot of work.
[246:27.01]It feels like cheating.
[246:28.02]It feels like hacks.
[246:37.44]What else do we have?
[246:37.98]Knives.
[246:39.48]Alright, I'm gonna go get that other guy.
[246:40.90]Yeah, there's one more guy here.
[246:41.58]Elephant's not doing it.
[246:42.59]Elephant's okay though.
[246:43.75]He's doing... Elephant is swimming.
[246:44.85]He's in the water.
[246:45.29]Elephant is swimming.
[246:48.69]This fire seriously is freaking me out.
[246:53.73]No, the elephant wanted to go all the way over here to get the guy with the arrows.
[246:59.06]What a kill shot, dude.
[247:00.76]That was a legit swinging neck breaker on that guy.
[247:07.33]Unbelievable.
[247:08.75]Elephants are definitely amazing.
[247:10.97]Challenge mode complete.
[247:12.99]We are the masters.
[247:14.77]Nice work.
[247:23.02]Excellent work.
[247:25.03]Somebody in your stream chat just said, I sound like Star.
[247:27.77]I resent that remark.
[247:29.53]He sounds like everybody.
[247:30.67]I do.
[247:32.77]Apparently, I sound like everyone.
[247:34.33]This guy's way cooler than Star, though.
[247:37.52]I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[247:39.24]Alright, weapons I want.
[247:47.28]There's not any cool weapons yet.
[247:48.62]We have to complete the campaign.
[247:49.86]We have to do actual missions.
[247:52.14]Which is single player.
[247:54.40]I know.
[247:54.88]Healing syringe, body armor.
[247:56.21]I'm going to buy this.
[248:02.21]Oh, I already have it.
[248:02.73]I might as well customize this thing.
[248:08.19]Can I do anything?
[248:13.21]I'm not sure I can change the paint.
[248:15.69]Oh, cool.
[248:16.17]Classic.
[248:17.01]No, that's too much money.
[248:20.15]Alright.
[248:21.07]Reach the targets and gear up.
[248:22.65]What's going on out here?
[248:25.38]Oh, a gunfire, apparently.
[248:45.83]They're having a little skirmish.
[248:47.61]Come back.
[248:47.93]Hold on.
[248:48.25]Wait, wait, wait.
[248:48.59]This is like something weird.
[248:50.89]Stop where you're going.
[248:53.29]Back up like five feet, though.
[248:54.49]My connection's getting weird.
[248:56.56]Stand right there.
[248:57.98]Yeah.
[248:58.18]Something's going on with my connection.
[248:59.88]I'm not sure what it is.
[249:05.28]See?
[249:05.52]I told you.
[249:06.52]See the connection problem I'm having?
[249:07.56]I got that on camera.
[249:09.00]Yeah, I'm having a connection problem.
[249:10.40]Yeah.
[249:11.01]See the weird blip there?
[249:12.75]Comcast has this weird thing where when you start disconnecting from the game, it kills me.
[249:18.41]Yeah, see, it's weird.
[249:19.87]Like that.
[249:20.27]Look at that.
[249:21.51]Finally, got it.
[249:22.47]I guess it went through.
[249:23.08]Nice.
[249:25.20]Alright, let's go do the next thing.
[249:31.30]I could up my skills up.
[249:33.12]How'd you get your wingsuit?
[249:33.94]I wanted to do the wingsuit.
[249:36.76]Uh, you have to buy it from the shop.
[249:38.62]It's from the shop?
[249:41.14]Let's go find, like, a cool wingsuit spot.
[249:45.21]Nice try.
[249:46.89]Wasn't shooting at you.
[249:47.97]Oh, you just took out everyone over there.
[249:52.05]Wasn't aiming at you.
[249:52.99]Alright, wingsuit.
[249:56.29]We have to do some cool wingsuit stuff together.
[249:58.49]This is like, wingsuits actually, I'm gonna break it to you easy as I can.
[250:02.20]It's not as fun as it should be.
[250:04.04]Where is it?
[250:04.62]Oh, there it is.
[250:06.84]How do you activate it?
[250:09.70]You kind of get lucky.
[250:11.78]You get lucky.
[250:13.30]You like hold space.
[250:15.76]I don't know.
[250:16.24]Alright.
[250:21.27]I'm ready.
[250:23.91]Thanks a lot, Pizza.
[250:24.75]Are you?
[250:25.35]Welcome, Pizza.
[250:29.65]I was ready.
[250:30.29]How ready do you?
[250:31.69]I was ready until you decided to do the I dropped a bomb on you joke that I just did.
[250:34.91]God.
[250:38.33]Let's go.
[250:39.79]We- it's pretty far away, we should probably get in the car.
[250:42.29]You didn't even die.
[250:43.53]Don't be mad.
[250:45.23]I'm always mad, don't you know, Jerma's mad for free?
[250:48.37]Jerma's mad fucking fucking for free.
[250:51.83]Take that boat.
[250:52.27]There's no cars here, by the way.
[250:54.23]Don't worry, we don't need a car.
[250:56.64]Where are we going?
[250:57.32]We don't need cars.
[250:59.48]What boat?
[251:00.54]This one.
[251:01.44]There's no boat.
[251:03.22]There's like a machine gun boat right here.
[251:05.30]There's no boat!
[251:07.20]Alright, so you have to tell me this.
[251:08.78]Hey!
[251:09.70]Hey, you're doing the swimming animation.
[251:11.66]Get me up here.
[251:12.24]Alright, this is going to be good.
[251:15.57]So there's no boat here for you, okay?
[251:16.89]Alright guys, you're going to have to get out of here.
[251:19.87]Leave, please.
[251:21.11]Leave.
[251:22.15]Out.
[251:23.53]Out.
[251:24.65]That does not mean drive away.
[251:26.09]Where are they taking me?
[251:29.11]Please get... Bye.
[251:33.43]It was fun playing multiplayer with you.
[251:36.50]I had fun.
[251:39.38]I'm gonna- I have to get- Get up!
[251:43.16]What?
[251:43.74]Get up!
[251:44.63]You're just punching the water.
[251:46.31]God.
[251:46.41]Help me.
[251:46.83]You have to help me.
[251:48.15]Do I have to come out there and rescue you?
[251:51.13]She just fell out of the boat.
[251:53.33]What is he doing?
[251:54.19]What is it?
[251:56.41]Come out here and rescue me.
[251:57.47]I can't.
[252:00.44]He went to get the gun.
[252:01.16]He went to get the gun.
[252:02.46]You can't rescue anyone in the water.
[252:03.94]Oh, what?
[252:05.75]No, I have to get out of the water.
[252:09.00]Can you like injured swim this direction?
[252:12.10]No, I can't even move.
[252:14.28]I love how that guy tried to get into the spot and then slopped over.
[252:17.62]Alright, well, just stay over here so this thing doesn't despawn.
[252:28.51]Because there is a machine gun on this boat.
[252:29.95]You are just clipping through this.
[252:33.05]Yeah, I, uh, yeah.
[252:34.65]Hey, watch this.
[252:35.13]Wanna see something cool?
[252:36.93]Yeah.
[252:38.04]Watch this.
[252:39.72]Ready?
[252:40.32]I'm ready.
[252:41.96]It's an alligator.
[252:46.90]I... Oh, it's an alligator.
[252:50.18]Alligator versus elephant.
[252:51.62]I think I saw this on National Geographic one time.
[252:53.90]It's not working the way it's intended.
[252:56.44]What?
[252:58.46]Um, you just heard me.
[253:01.42]Oh.
[253:01.82]Well, I killed the alligator, didn't I?
[253:03.80]Is it dead?
[253:04.22]I think so.
[253:04.92]Yeah, it's dead.
[253:05.44]Okay, well, that was supposed to be cooler.
[253:06.91]That wasn't as cool as it was going to be.
[253:08.73]It was kind of cool.
[253:09.19]I wish you could ride the alligator.
[253:11.11]Alright, I'm getting on this boat.
[253:11.97]Oh, no, that would be sick.
[253:13.21]So, I want you to tell me.
[253:14.49]People, check, do a multi-stream.
[253:16.59]Like, go watch his stream.
[253:18.55]Because this is going to look real odd.
[253:22.46]It already does.
[253:26.70]You're doing like this splits jump in the water.
[253:30.34]Am I shooting a gun?
[253:32.17]No.
[253:32.81]I'm not shooting a gun.
[253:34.43]No.
[253:36.25]Honestly, I'm not.
[253:38.85]Ow.
[253:39.53]Ow.
[253:41.37]Not shooting a gun, huh?
[253:41.89]Don't kill me with your invisible bullets.
[253:44.87]Guy says I'm not shooting a gun.
[253:48.08]Let's see what happens if I respawn on you while you're in the boat.
[253:50.84]Yeah, that'll be odd.
[253:53.24]You're in a seat right now.
[253:54.30]That kind of bandwidth.
[253:58.06]You're in a seat in the boat right now?
[253:59.70]Yeah, I'm sitting in the boat.
[254:01.32]Let's see what happens when I respawn.
[254:03.26]I hope.
[254:03.96]There you are.
[254:04.28]Just swimming.
[254:09.72]Come back over here.
[254:12.40]Come to me.
[254:13.08]Jump up to me.
[254:18.30]Get on top of me.
[254:21.75]I can't.
[254:22.19]You have to get closer to the shore.
[254:23.59]I can't jump in the water.
[254:24.67]I'm not a dolphin.
[254:27.42]I'm like, just jump like in front of me, jump.
[254:29.40]Okay, okay, stop, stop, stop, stop moving.
[254:31.24]You're in the boat.
[254:31.78]Oh, you just were in the boat.
[254:35.68]Alright.
[254:36.58]So, no, no, stop moving, stop moving.
[254:37.96]I'm swimming underwater.
[254:39.68]Scoot a little closer.
[254:40.67]Were you really?
[254:41.91]Yeah.
[254:43.09]Oh, too close.
[254:44.03]Okay.
[254:44.15]You're good, you're good.
[254:45.19]Okay, stop right there.
[254:45.87]Okay, stay right there.
[254:49.03]I can't stop.
[254:49.71]I'm swimming.
[254:50.27]Hang on, hang on.
[254:50.95]You just have to wait.
[254:51.63]Oh.
[254:52.69]Almost.
[254:53.76]Almost.
[254:55.19]Okay.
[254:55.69]Well, now I'm dead.
[254:56.19]I guess you're dead.
[254:56.67]It doesn't make any sense.
[255:03.20]Double ear vision.
[255:04.74]Oh, you gotta mute one of the streams.
[255:08.95]You open up both streams and mute one of them.
[255:11.19]Yeah, you open one and mute one.
[255:13.62]I mean, you open two and mute one.
[255:14.87]Open two and mute one.
[255:17.55]Open one and mute one.
[255:18.63]Is Flanker in this game?
[255:20.08]That wouldn't work.
[255:21.46]Thanks, Lolinator, for eight months.
[255:23.18]Welcome back, dude.
[255:24.70]Much appreciated.
[255:27.45]Alright, what happens if I shoot you?
[255:29.29]It's gonna blow up.
[255:30.51]But if I shoot you, like, I see... I don't... This can't be you in the... It's me.
[255:35.23]You shot me directly in the face.
[255:37.31]Oh.
[255:37.83]No, that was, like, in the dick.
[255:39.95]Well, you definitely hurt me.
[255:43.31]Okay.
[255:44.01]I can't believe that this gun doesn't work.
[255:45.41]Like, you can't see the bullets coming out of my hands like a magician or something.
[255:51.97]Nice try.
[255:52.43]Alright, well...
[255:56.41]Alright.
[255:57.85]Come a little closer.
[255:58.63]Nice knowing you.
[255:59.14]Alright, here's where you go.
[256:01.02]Yeah, just zoom.
[256:02.46]Zoom away.
[256:04.66]Like, just start driving.
[256:08.70]Pick a direction and just go.
[256:10.12]Hold on.
[256:11.04]Keep the camera.
[256:11.52]Fast as you can.
[256:11.96]Keep that camera on me.
[256:14.44]Oh, it's on you.
[256:15.02]Alright.
[256:21.28]No, I was trying to scare him into running into you.
[256:22.76]Alright, I'm going to zoom past you.
[256:26.35]Yep.
[256:31.15]I wish I could see how dumb that looks.
[256:33.42]Go all the way to that lake and then turn around and come back.
[256:36.34]I'm gonna drive straight into you.
[256:44.99]Okay, here I come.
[256:48.51]I wanna show you my new boat.
[256:51.41]It's so wonderful.
[256:53.81]You look really, really happy to show me that boat.
[256:57.15]This is so fun.
[256:57.77]You want to see it up close?
[257:03.73]Oh, did I get you with my crotch?
[257:04.99]Did I hit you in the face with my crotch?
[257:06.44]I'm sorry.
[257:07.12]I honestly wonder what that looks like.
[257:12.18]I wish you could see it, because you would be having so much fun right now.
[257:16.48]In your stream, you're just driving a boat.
[257:19.30]Yeah, in my stream, I'm in a boat.
[257:23.93]I wish he would do it for me.
[257:27.01]Hi.
[257:28.79]I think these two are about to fight.
[257:30.39]The piranha versus the elephant.
[257:32.37]Piranha versus elephant?
[257:33.89]Who's gonna win?
[257:40.34]Oh, elephants retreating.
[257:41.92]Yeah, maybe not.
[257:42.62]Maybe the elephant got scared of the mouse.
[257:46.90]Alright, I think we've had enough of the invisible boat.
[257:54.20]Dude, that was so unnecessary.
[257:57.20]That was our friend.
[257:58.12]I need his skin.
[258:02.82]I need his skin.
[258:03.42]What is this?
[258:04.90]What did you put down on the ground?
[258:06.54]Oh, God, it's on my hands.
[258:08.76]What my character said.
[258:11.68]Alright, let's go.
[258:12.12]What he said.
[258:15.12]Let's go.
[258:20.12]Is this invisible up here?
[258:22.28]What?
[258:23.77]This car.
[258:24.45]And these people.
[258:24.95]What?
[258:25.49]Which one?
[258:27.00]This car right here.
[258:27.58]There's nothing here, is there?
[258:31.26]No.
[258:33.18]Well... That's... I did not mean to even do that.
[258:38.05]Okay.
[258:38.53]I like... I just slotted that guy.
[258:40.93]Got a sniper rifle.
[258:43.27]What am I doing?
[258:43.97]Look at me.
[258:44.31]What am I doing when I do this?
[258:47.97]A gun just appeared out of thin air.
[258:51.53]Well, I just murdered two people.
[258:52.99]Okay, apparently we can't use that.
[258:59.26]I hear a car speeding somewhere.
[259:06.04]I turn around and you just get hit.
[259:08.08]Oh, God!
[259:08.84]Is this guy trying to take off?
[259:13.73]Oh, boy!
[259:14.63]See you later, Tox.
[259:15.29]Bye.
[259:19.30]You got him!
[259:20.78]I didn't even shoot him.
[259:21.96]That's the funny thing.
[259:22.64]I hit the wheel.
[259:23.72]You hit that guy right in the head.
[259:26.68]No, I hit the wheel.
[259:27.72]And it ricocheted.
[259:30.34]Look, I can do the same thing.
[259:37.05]Why is there a merchant over there?
[259:42.67]God, it's so fun to just dick around in games like this.
[259:45.24]I know, I really enjoy it.
[259:46.10]We haven't done a damn thing in two hours.
[259:47.72]Well, to be fair, you can't do campaign missions.
[259:52.88]Ambush!
[259:53.26]Ambush!
[259:53.94]Ambush!
[259:55.30]Ambush!
[259:55.50]Ambush!
[259:57.71]Wait, are we supposed to be going to the yellow?
[259:59.67]Yeah.
[260:03.81]Ambush!
[260:05.65]Ambush!
[260:07.55]Hey.
[260:10.48]I wonder if I can jump off in wingsuit.
[260:13.14]Oh, yeah, you haven't wingsuited yet.
[260:14.38]Well, let me give you an opportunity.
[260:15.86]Give me an opportunity.
[260:16.44]Is it a hold space?
[260:18.54]I think so.
[260:19.10]That's the thing we have to do.
[260:20.71]Aw.
[260:21.73]Aw.
[260:22.67]Wait, it's right here.
[260:23.65]We might as well just do it.
[260:25.53]Whatever the hell this is.
[260:28.77]What is it?
[260:29.33]It's a shotgun of some sort.
[260:33.75]Yeah, shotgun.
[260:37.28]Oh, I just alerted the horde.
[260:40.70]Indeed.
[260:41.72]Watch out.
[260:42.22]You're in a bad spot because that thing is going to blow.
[260:45.07]What's going to blow?
[260:46.61]The building because someone's going to shoot that accidentally.
[260:49.59]I'm going to kill the two commanders.
[260:53.33]Okay.
[260:57.09]You did not use a shotgun.
[260:58.73]I'm shooting with my shotgun.
[261:00.63]I shot with a sniper.
[261:02.11]I didn't know this was a shotgun mission.
[261:05.13]Okay, I shot the shotgun and said, you did not use the shotgun.
[261:09.17]Okay, I got a shotgun now.
[261:10.35]Okay, let's go.
[261:11.27]I didn't know that was the point of the whole thing.
[261:15.07]Okay.
[261:16.57]What is... I... I jumped off the... Somebody tell me what happened.
[261:23.29]Somebody tell me.
[261:25.89]It squeezed on.
[261:26.71]Like, what was that?
[261:28.55]I... I wingsuited and, like, ziplined.
[261:31.35]I...
[261:35.99]I don't have a shotgun.
[261:37.17]I don't have a shotgun.
[261:40.85]Where's the mission?
[261:41.85]What is going on?
[261:45.97]Oh, that was a civilian.
[261:51.49]Get a shotgun.
[261:53.12]Okay, we both got shot.
[261:54.32]Why did I not have a shotgun?
[261:56.26]I had it in my hands.
[261:57.62]No, use the zip line.
[261:58.62]Detach.
[262:01.78]Shotgun.
[262:05.62]My fucking god.
[262:07.02]Please get me up.
[262:09.72]I gotta go in the building.
[262:10.62]Oh, I'm dead.
[262:11.72]I'm crawling in.
[262:13.00]Crawl in the building.
[262:14.04]Where I can see you.
[262:15.52]As close as I can get.
[262:16.54]That's as close as you can get?
[262:17.36]Are you serious?
[262:18.21]That's as close as I can get.
[262:19.09]I can't even pick you up.
[262:19.93]All I did was throw the weapon.
[262:20.99]I'm throwing my guns on the ground.
[262:24.91]Oh, gotcha.
[262:25.43]I'm up.
[262:26.21]I'm dead.
[262:32.00]Are you gonna respawn or...
[262:33.74]I don't know.
[262:35.18]Yeah.
[262:35.32]12 seconds.
[262:35.68]Do you have a timer?
[262:36.98]11 seconds.
[262:37.30]Just stay there.
[262:39.56]I was just whipping my guns at your body.
[262:42.80]Why are there stairs here?
[262:44.42]There's somebody up there.
[262:45.78]Two seconds don't get killed.
[262:49.25]Okay.
[262:49.71]Shotgun.
[262:50.77]No, that's not the shotgun.
[262:52.01]Please take the shotgun out.
[262:52.73]Wrong shotgun.
[262:53.23]The other shotgun.
[262:53.97]Oh, shit.
[262:54.99]The shotgun's out here on the ground.
[262:59.41]You gotta kill that guy with the shotgun.
[263:00.74]I can't.
[263:01.12]I'm dead.
[263:05.38]Watch out, this guy in here.
[263:06.60]No, I'm dead.
[263:08.00]God, come on.
[263:09.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[263:10.84]Oh, no.
[263:15.33]Oh, no.
[263:17.71]Alright, let's go.
[263:18.27]Ready, ready, we've got the shotgun.
[263:19.29]Get the shotgun.
[263:19.79]Cool.
[263:20.13]Zipline.
[263:21.11]Alright.
[263:21.53]Oh, my gosh.
[263:22.37]Hey.
[263:23.94]Do I smell a rat?
[263:25.08]Alright, we're safe.
[263:28.14]Get in there.
[263:28.88]In this building.
[263:31.53]No, I'm like on the other side from you.
[263:33.87]I'm marking them all for you.
[263:35.23]Yeah, good, you're marking them for me.
[263:36.41]They're all going to run in here and destroy me.
[263:37.70]I'm going to sneak up on them.
[263:40.40]Super sneaky.
[263:42.40]Ready?
[263:43.13]Here we go.
[263:44.43]Am I ready?
[263:44.97]I'll distract them.
[263:50.55]Okay, this guy.
[263:52.23]I got this guy really distracted.
[263:55.07]You gotta come up and do like a stealth move to this guy.
[263:57.19]He has no idea what's going on.
[263:58.39]Nice.
[263:59.87]Nice work.
[264:00.45]One more guy.
[264:00.90]To the left.
[264:04.48]Kill him with the shotgun.
[264:08.14]Is that it?
[264:09.62]No, I didn't kill him.
[264:10.24]Did you kill him?
[264:11.12]We have to take a picture or something.
[264:12.24]Take a picture of each target.
[264:14.78]Make sure you get their good side.
[264:22.30]took a picture me too and uh took a picture nice actually I want the shotgun I like that I like that move you know I think I think we're done with the throw random grenades at each other you got right back up you're fine just gotta fix your hand you just messed up my watch
[264:47.80]It was to blow up the lady, okay?
[264:49.18]It wasn't to blow up you.
[264:49.90]I'm not going to pee so bad.
[264:51.44]Are these people asleep or did you kill them?
[264:54.20]I think that was the lady I threw the C4 at and blew up both of them.
[264:57.58]She kind of looks like she's just asleep.
[265:00.69]Let's put her back in bed.
[265:01.57]She'll wake up soon.
[265:04.03]Let's tuck her in.
[265:04.69]She'll wake up eventually and be like, oh, that was a nice snooze.
[265:09.73]It doesn't lead to anything.
[265:11.35]Yeah, it's a trap door.
[265:12.29]Here's the bed.
[265:13.75]She can just like... Alright, let's get out of here.
[265:20.54]Get in the truck.
[265:25.70]Where are we going?
[265:29.02]I don't know.
[265:29.44]This is like a bunch of explosions.
[265:31.00]Alright.
[265:35.15]We're going to go hit a watchtower, water tower thing.
[265:37.77]I think I hit it in the head.
[265:42.89]We're going to go do a thing.
[265:44.41]Good night, Unidroid.
[265:45.13]Thanks for coming up.
[265:48.56]Jeremy's good at tucking in dead people.
[265:51.68]Hey, angry probed droid, thanks for six months.
[265:53.84]And then we're gonna glide off of it.
[265:56.10]Where am I?
[265:56.76]I'm currently... That sounds like a good idea.
[266:00.89]Thanks a lot, dude.
[266:01.41]Welcome back for six months in a row.
[266:04.91]You didn't have to grand slam her.
[266:06.67]Well, I... There's no gentle, like, push down.
[266:09.53]You just like to throw him down.
[266:11.89]It's late.
[266:12.32]Alright, where are we going?
[266:14.38]Is it like a... Ooh, ooh.
[266:15.40]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[266:17.04]Get out.
[266:18.77]We're gonna try something extremely important.
[266:20.91]You know how we can, like, stand on each other?
[266:23.41]Uh-huh.
[266:25.19]Um... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[266:27.35]Go ahead and use it.
[266:28.77]Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
[266:30.11]Why is it falling?
[266:31.61]Why is it... This did not just happen, did it?
[266:35.99]It did.
[266:37.21]It just happened.
[266:39.01]That just happened.
[266:39.53]I wish you could see that from my side.
[266:44.87]You can't even... Ugh.
[266:48.06]Ay yi yi.
[266:49.28]You have to see that from my angle.
[266:50.80]I was gonna stand.
[266:55.96]Now it's ruined.
[266:57.22]Yeah, it's gone.
[267:02.08]We have to try that though.
[267:06.05]What a pain in the ass.
[267:17.40]Is there another one?
[267:18.80]Track down a glider.
[267:22.56]Let's just see what's at the top of this thing.
[267:23.94]Maybe we'll be able to see a glider.
[267:28.06]Liberate this thing.
[267:32.02]I don't think you liberate.
[267:32.92]I think you just climb it.
[267:34.79]There's an ammo box at the bottom.
[267:37.63]Well, yeah.
[267:39.77]Thanks for that.
[267:41.63]84,000.
[267:42.15]I don't know where I got that from, but thanks.
[267:46.65]You were probably from me.
[267:47.61]Are people up top?
[267:49.31]Why do I hear a dog barking?
[267:51.01]I hear the dog barking as well.
[267:56.52]If we get up here and there's just a dog at the top, I don't even know what the hell I'm going to do.
[268:02.18]It's getting louder.
[268:02.80]I don't see a dog down here.
[268:12.10]No clue, dude.
[268:15.95]Uh, it's over here.
[268:23.05]Almost there.
[268:23.99]I'm gonna fall here, I know it.
[268:33.33]Alright, where's the tower dog?
[268:39.43]It's so high.
[268:40.73]There's a zip line, too.
[268:42.07]Oh, we can wingsuit off this, can't we?
[268:43.84]Oh, yeah.
[268:44.20]That's why I came up here in the first place.
[268:50.82]Excellent.
[268:51.24]Nice work.
[268:55.26]Liberated the tower.
[268:57.00]Can we go up here?
[268:57.88]Don't pull us out of here.
[268:59.14]I really hope it doesn't put us at the bottom.
[269:01.74]I don't think it will.
[269:02.30]There's a zip line up here for a reason.
[269:08.16]Watch your step.
[269:19.52]We opened up a bunch of places.
[269:21.16]Okay.
[269:22.28]Can we go even higher than this?
[269:24.57]I see a rope.
[269:25.19]Can I grab this rope?
[269:29.03]That is off limits.
[269:30.71]Alright, let's see if we can spot another glider.
[269:33.51]Maybe the glider respawned after that.
[269:35.13]Yeah, if you can find another glider, we can just dive off here and activate our wingsuits.
[269:40.24]We can do that anyway.
