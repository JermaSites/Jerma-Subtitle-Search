[00:04.25]Loot weapons and fuel.
[00:06.37]Find a vehicle bar.
[00:08.35]Kill zombies.
[00:10.17]Escape to safety.
[00:12.43]Be a part of soiled.
[00:14.89]You want to get ravaged, Eden Dingus?
[00:17.81]What'd you say to me?
[00:18.43]You want to get ravaged?
[00:22.69]I love this hill.
[00:26.21]What?
[00:26.95]What?
[00:28.25]Where am I?
[00:28.91]Shh, shh.
[00:30.78]We're going to blow Jerma with this grenade.
[00:32.44]Shh.
[00:33.25]I get to get the middle ground here.
[00:34.31]Why are they all the way up there?
[00:36.11]Do you see this?
[00:36.79]They're just running into a rock.
[00:39.56]What the hell is going on?
[00:40.38]That's not what I expected to be throwing at you.
[00:42.18]What is going on?
[00:44.92]What the fuck just happened?
[00:46.78]What?
[00:49.34]What?
[00:50.08]What?
[00:51.62]Oh my god.
[01:00.58]What?
[01:02.79]Why is it- why is it an old piano?
[01:06.11]Do you know what I seriously thought that was?
[01:07.33]I thought that was a fucking ad, like pulling up in the background.
[01:10.43]Here, here, I'm gonna throw it at the zombies.
[01:14.01]Can't deal.
[01:15.15]Alright, we all need to get grenades and throw them at the same time.
[01:18.41]Okay, they respawn right here on this little box.
[01:21.61]We just need to wait for them to respawn.
[01:22.53]I'm telling you right now, if we overlap all the music together, then I'm gonna have to go to the hospital.
[01:27.95]They're not spawning if we're in here.
[01:29.07]Let's stand outside and like, it's like Santa.
[01:31.99]Okay?
[01:32.67]Like, pretend we're asleep.
[01:33.77]We're asleep right now.
[01:35.54]It'll spawn.
[01:36.06]Yeah, you gotta pretend you're asleep.
[01:38.96]Look, I'm sleeping.
[01:39.62]Oh, I hope I get Nintendo.
[01:42.28]Oh.
[01:42.39]I hope I get Super Mario Bros. 3.
[01:57.55]Well, now we're all awake.
[01:59.15]Oh, God.
[01:59.67]I can't.
[02:00.55]I can't.
[02:01.15]Bye.
[02:01.53]I need to leave for a second.
[02:04.11]Ugh.
[02:27.93]Get up here, get up here.
[02:28.89]I am getting absolutely fucked.
[02:30.53]I can't.
[02:31.77]Come on, come on, you can do it.
[02:32.73]Get out of my way, get out of my way.
[02:34.27]Did they climb the ladders?
[02:36.03]Did they really?
[02:36.77]That one guy climbed it.
[02:38.45]Yeah, nobody else is.
[02:39.63]Was that, was that like a bad program?
[02:41.47]What?
[02:43.86]Was that a bad program?
[02:46.18]Was that, yeah, that was a bad program.
[02:49.06]Yeah, we need to get the fuel.
[02:49.94]I want to drive that car around.
[02:51.46]I want to be the driver.
[02:53.40]And I want to go...
[02:57.15]Let's do it.
[02:58.33]Run them over.
[02:58.83]They did it!
[03:01.51]Who's making noise?
[03:02.45]Like, there's a bunch of zombies showing up here just because when you shoot guns, they come.
[03:06.65]Who's making noise?
[03:07.47]Oh my god, we gotta go.
[03:09.15]We gotta go, guys.
[03:10.47]Is that me?
[03:11.67]I'm firing the tank.
[03:14.16]Who's making noise, he asks.
[03:15.76]The guy in the goddamn tank.
[03:21.48]That is so stupid.
[03:22.78]Like, seriously.
[03:29.43]Watch this!
[03:30.35]Look at this!
[03:32.29]Look at this!
[03:32.75]See?
[03:34.51]You guys are so far gone right now.
[03:36.17]I can't even see you on the map.
[03:38.02]Nah, we don't go pick them up.
[03:40.16]I'm going to need some help.
[03:41.86]I've got a trail of wounds.
[03:43.20]Shut up!
[03:43.48]This is me and Meilyr playing this for a video.
[03:47.14]To the left, to the left, to the left!
[03:48.38]There's a thing to the left!
[03:49.18]I need some help, please!
[03:50.64]I have zombies all over me!
[03:52.98]What the f- I hope this thing just explodes because it's on fire.
[03:56.30]Goodbye!
[03:58.87]What?
[03:59.15]Where are you?
[03:59.67]What's going on?
[04:01.57]Why am I just... What just happened?
[04:04.99]I jumped off.
[04:06.17]I was out of there.
[04:06.97]I didn't want none of that.
[04:08.31]So I'm gone forever.
[04:09.25]I don't think I'm gone forever.
[04:12.02]Yeah, you're dead.
[04:16.20]Okay, I'm gonna try and fly this.
[04:18.80]Okay, apparently I don't even have to.
[04:21.25]Oh.
[04:22.53]Look at us two ladies.
[04:24.21]How did you fail?
[04:25.03]What do you mean how did we fail?
[04:26.13]You're dead.
[04:26.95]You failed.
[04:27.59]You're dead.
[04:29.23]Oh, I see.
[04:29.85]You failed.
[04:30.89]We got a victory.
[04:31.67]Nice job on our screen.
[04:33.01]Because we didn't blow up on a quad that you didn't know.
[04:35.62]Like, you didn't... What was that?
[04:37.08]Hey, it was a team effort.
[04:38.28]That's bullshit.
[04:40.18]I'm just gonna go get more ammo.
[04:41.22]There's like another RPG up here.
[04:43.04]Let's take the pickup truck.
[04:47.52]Oh, I see an icon of where something is.
[04:52.65]I just want to drive my quad.
[04:57.23]I never get to drive- What?!
[04:59.48]Put this in a- Yo, get all the zombies and I'll play music at them.
[05:21.06]I don't think I can ever make it back up.
[05:23.44]So, um... It was nice to know both of you.
[05:29.90]You're wounded.
[05:31.57]Nope, Dean Vigas is dead.
[05:33.17]You're out of the game.
[05:34.17]I'm dead?
[05:34.67]You're out of the game.
[05:35.57]Oh, I didn't think... I thought I was gonna do, like, a Super Mario Kart, where, like, it puts me back, like, in front of where people are.
[05:42.13]No, this is the real world.
[05:43.39]I'm sorry.
[05:44.01]Well, see you in 20 minutes.
[05:45.54]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:46.84]Oh, shit, dude.
[05:53.27]Please kill yourself so that Kelv-003 can play.
[05:57.41]You suck at killing yourself.
[06:01.51]Go, go, go.
[06:07.12]This is actually working?
[06:09.74]This is actually working right now.
[06:12.54]Are you serious?
[06:13.28]Go off a jump, go off a jump.
[06:15.00]If you go off a jump, I'm going.
[06:16.14]I'm probably gone.
[06:18.40]Your front foot is on the drop.
[06:22.47]What just happened?
[06:24.33]Where did it go?
[06:25.23]Did you bail?
[06:26.61]No, I flipped it.
[06:28.59]Yeah, you have to bail and make sure you crouch.
[06:30.37]I am, I am.
[06:32.41]Let's go.
[06:33.28]Am I crouching?
[06:36.38]I think so, yeah, holding control.
[06:38.14]Uh, yeah, I wasn't sure which crush was.
[06:40.34]Go, go, go!
[06:41.62]No, don't!
[06:43.54]Waiter!
[06:43.80]Oh god!
[06:45.02]Oh, save me!
[06:46.48]Let me on!
[06:50.68]Hold on.
[06:51.32]Oh, okay.
[06:52.37]I need a good weapon.
[06:53.65]Oh, here we go.
[06:54.39]Help me!
[06:55.71]Why?!
[06:57.19]Why do you always die?!
[06:59.23]Why?!
[07:01.69]You're unrevivable!
[07:03.41]What keeps exploding underneath this thing?! !
[07:08.85]Run him over.
[07:09.77]Run him the fuck over.
[07:13.79]Can we blow up the helicopter while they're in it?
[07:16.71]Hold on, stop for a second.
[07:18.91]Back up a bit, back up a bit.
[07:20.01]Shoot it!
[07:20.35]Shoot it!
[07:20.61]Shoot it!
[07:20.83]Don't let him get out of here alive!
[07:21.81]Shoot it!
[07:22.33]Shoot him!
[07:22.57]Blow him up!
[07:23.31]I don't think it's working!
[07:25.81]I really hope it doesn't.
[07:27.51]Get out!
[07:27.83]Get out!
[07:28.31]Abort!
[07:28.81]Abort!
[07:29.25]Abort!
[07:29.51]Get in!
[07:29.91]Get in!
[07:32.75]Oh no!
[07:33.47]He got eaten!
[07:34.09]Star.
[07:35.43]Star.
[07:36.73]You failed!
[07:39.17]If I didn't try and kill the helicopter, I would've gotten away.
[07:42.85]What the hell are you doing?
[07:46.38]I found a nail gun.
[07:48.10]You know, the thing about these videos is we don't even actually play the game.
[07:52.20]Ever.
[07:53.12]You're just floating.
[07:54.08]Yeah, we don't play a game.
[07:54.72]You're not even on the- Don't play a game.
[07:58.83]Can we go around this way?
[07:59.81]No, I'm telling you, we out.
[08:01.68]There's no more zombies.
[08:02.62]There's nothing out here.
[08:04.50]We're completely blocked.
[08:05.66]We could just go home.
[08:06.42]There's no zombies out here.
[08:08.35]I'm just gonna go home.
[08:10.43]I'm just going home.
[08:11.13]See you later.
[08:12.62]I found a nail gun at the end.
[08:15.40]Look at the kill counts.
[08:16.26]Look at the kill counts.
[08:16.96]Look at Star at the top.
[08:18.12]What did you guys do?
[08:18.64]Let's see who needs to step it up next time.
[08:20.46]What did you guys do?
[08:21.18]Look at Ding Ding.
[08:22.14]Look at Ding Ding.
[08:22.94]A solid two kills.
[08:24.76]I killed 14 zombies.
[08:26.10]What a contribution.
[08:30.52]I like the line through your name, too.
[08:32.50]I did a lot.
[08:33.22]I did a lot.
[08:33.90]I killed... Oh, I found a gun.
[08:35.59]Oh, I found a gun.
