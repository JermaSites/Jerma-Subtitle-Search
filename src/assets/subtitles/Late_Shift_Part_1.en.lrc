[01:19.23]Hey.
[01:21.91]What?
[01:23.69]Good evening, guys.
[01:25.89]It's me.
[01:27.71]Your friend, Jeremy.
[01:29.57]Your best friend.
[01:30.87]Let me rephrase that.
[01:31.57]Your best friend, Jeremy.
[01:34.97]He's here.
[01:37.67]Give me a second.
[01:38.29]We're going to play some Casino Incorporated.
[01:40.87]Yeah.
[01:41.15]Yes, we are.
[01:44.86]Let me get it set up.
[01:45.58]I got just a couple more things to do.
[01:48.44]Be right back.
[01:52.12]Wait, what?
[02:02.26]Wait, what?
[02:12.25]Wait, what?
[02:22.15]Wait, what?
[02:32.15]Wait, what?
[02:42.19]Wait, what?
[02:52.19]Wait, what?
[03:02.23]Wait, what?
[03:12.24]Wait, what?
[03:16.86]Holy shit, that's a lot of what's.
[03:20.14]I just got back and I hear like, wait, what?
[03:22.37]Wait, wait, what?
[03:26.35]I'll give you an update on this, by the way.
[03:29.20]So if you're curious as to what's going to happen with the subs and resubs and all that shit.
[03:35.42]There's going to be a little box that's going to be in the bottom left part of the screen, probably.
[03:41.26]Or top right, I'm not sure.
[03:42.30]It's going to be small, but it'll be big enough to see.
[03:45.86]And it's going to be sort of the last subs.
[03:50.92]There won't be any more pop-ups like this.
[03:56.24]Nice 2016 sub sound.
[03:58.06]I know, right?
[04:01.18]There's gonna be better, like... It's gonna be better laid out.
[04:04.90]It's gonna be a small box.
[04:06.54]I'll be able to see it.
[04:08.10]It's not just gonna be like fucking Comic Sans text that pops up on the screen.
[04:15.13]And it won't be as... The term I'm looking for here is shitty.
[04:21.19]It's not gonna be shitty.
[04:24.30]I gotta talk to Bloido about that.
[04:25.66]He's gonna be making it.
[04:29.07]Do I know Kendrick Lamar?
[04:30.55]I do not.
[04:32.13]I do not know who that is.
[04:36.71]Comic Sans.
[04:37.45]Yeah, it's Comic Sans.
[04:43.41]I'm supposed to write a paper, but I'm live.
[04:45.93]Well, write your paper, dude.
[04:47.37]Don't watch me.
[04:48.07]Go write your paper.
[04:49.01]That's more important.
[04:54.01]Welcome to the not shitty stream.
[04:56.99]Holy shit, there are so many resubs.
[04:59.40]Oh my god.
[05:01.84]It's just the resub train.
[05:06.30]Somebody has no idea what's going on.
[05:07.96]This guy's gonna keep saying wait what for like the next fucking four hours.
[05:14.04]This guy is like going over my taxes.
[05:16.40]The person saying wait what right now is going over my taxes.
[05:20.20]Wait, what?
[05:21.10]You spent, like, fucking eight grand on a fucking shitty wrestling video?
[05:25.67]What?
[05:26.21]You fucking dropped $400 on a PSVR?
[05:29.09]Wait, what happened here?
[05:30.19]You fucking, you bought, like, four dogs?
[05:32.77]What?
[05:33.53]Oh my god.
[05:41.16]But anyways, yes, this is Casino Inc.
[05:45.16]It's gonna be fun.
[05:46.54]I hope.
[05:47.70]Who knows?
[05:51.86]sub rocket ship But I'm just waiting for people to trickle in I'm gonna explain a few things We got it.
[05:59.70]We actually have a couple things to talk about we do This is very important thing is going on And let me the purposes of hold on Let me just make sure I get this yeah, okay, I
[06:18.57]So, over the course of the next month, I have, after this week, I bought like 40 games on Amazon.
[06:26.53]And they're all going to fit into certain categories and... Hold on.
[06:29.73]Why is this not loading?
[06:32.31]There you go.
[06:32.92]Okay.
[06:34.34]So, while we sit here for a minute, I'm actually going to mute the CLR browser because we need to talk.
[06:45.14]We need to talk very important stuff here.
[06:48.37]So... If you could... Next week... We're gonna start... One of these.
[06:58.13]Okay?
[07:00.23]Go vote on this.
[07:01.26]This is a straw poll.
[07:05.58]On this straw poll, you're gonna see something called Western Week, Dinosaur Week, or Game Show Week.
[07:11.06]There were...
[07:14.12]About... There's probably like 10 games each.
[07:20.18]For... Why am I having such trouble talking right now?
[07:23.65]I'm like, I'm so thrown off right now.
[07:25.23]Hold on a second.
[07:25.75]Let me fucking like sit up straight.
[07:28.15]And like start to talk.
[07:31.81]Okay, so.
[07:33.47]What you're looking at right now...
[07:36.76]is, for instance, like, game show week.
[07:38.94]We're gonna spend an entire week on only game shows.
[07:42.01]We're gonna spend an entire week on only dinosaur games.
[07:45.13]Or we're gonna spend an entire week only on western games.
[07:47.81]And this is not like Fistful of Frags, by the way.
[07:50.31]This is old western games that you, like, can't buy anymore.
[07:54.57]That you have to buy on Amazon.
[07:57.78]Or these are... We're talking, like, Family Feud.
[07:59.46]We're talking Jeopardy.
[08:00.48]We're talking Wheel of Fortune.
[08:02.68]We're talking The Price is Right.
[08:05.48]All that shit's gonna happen over the course of a week.
[08:07.80]Dinosaur Week is like all the old carnivore games, all the old fucking Jurassic Park games.
[08:14.56]And each one of these is gonna happen.
[08:16.80]But you are voting right now on which one you want to see first.
[08:21.07]So do you want to see Game Show Week first, Dinosaur Week, or Western Week first?
[08:28.15]You will see the other two.
[08:29.29]It's just which one you want to see first.
[08:37.87]Wow.
[08:38.73]Game Show Week and Dinosaur Week are really neck and neck right now.
[08:41.82]I'm surprised.
[08:46.92]Because I have so many games.
[08:51.44]And I'm still buying more.
[08:54.72]We're taking a full week for each one of these genres.
[08:59.24]So... We don't have to... This ain't a big deal right now.
[09:04.99]But over the course of this week, this shit's gonna stay here.
[09:08.58]That straw poll is going to be up for the next four or five days.
[09:12.28]And I'll link it pretty much to every stream this week.
[09:16.16]So whatever you guys want to see first.
[09:19.54]But tonight... Tonight... Tonight we have, obviously... Something else we're doing.
[09:29.69]And let me just get this down here.
[09:30.99]Alright, we're gonna be playing Casino Inc.
[09:33.93]Look, I don't know anything about this game.
[09:35.33]I saw it on Steam.
[09:36.91]And I saw it actually on Amazon first, and I was seeing if it was on Steam.
[09:41.07]This game is gonna be fucking stupid.
[09:42.55]But, like, there are a couple of options.
[09:43.77]We have a couple of game sucks options.
[09:46.27]So don't worry.
[09:49.71]Alright.
[09:50.91]Let's turn this off.
[09:52.99]And bring this up.
[09:56.58]Should be working now.
[09:57.74]And here's the one problem with this.
[10:00.32]Let me get my CLR visor back on.
[10:02.28]Okay.
[10:04.53]It's going to be really hard for me to see any, like, bits.
[10:08.57]And, like, right when I say that, the second I say that, here comes fucking Glue Man.
[10:13.73]Like, the second I talk about how I can't see bits, all of a sudden, fucking Glue Man comes up.
[10:16.93]The fucking Jerma suplex.

[10:34.88]I think KXZ's went through.
[10:36.92]I'm not sure Styx's went through.
[10:39.28]Because it was being utilized.
[10:42.40]But just pretend some of those suplexes were from you.

[14:01.86]Okay, you guys, honest to God, are going to have to tell me if you can see this.
[14:04.67]Because I can't see anything on my other monitor.

[14:42.99]It's in the corner.
[14:46.29]I swear to God.
[14:47.43]Like, I like tested this before I started the stream too.
[14:50.69]That's like how fucking annoying this is.
[14:53.64]Uh, well.
[14:58.06]I can't run this fucking game in a window.
[15:01.48]But I wanted to play this game.
[15:05.81]What is this porno music?
[15:08.39]Hold on a second.
[15:14.88]I need to see where it is.
[15:19.01]Okay, I can see it now.
[15:20.55]Now I see what you guys are talking about.
[15:22.85]Holy shit, what a fucking joke.
[15:28.64]Alright.
[15:29.22]Let me try this.
[15:37.30]It's my casino.
[15:38.10]I can cry if I want to.
[15:39.37]That's right.
[15:40.09]You're right.
[15:42.50]Let's try this one.
[15:43.42]No, that's not going to work.
[15:47.44]Let's try this one more time and see what the fuck happens here.
[15:55.53]The game just crashed.
[16:06.01]Alright.
[16:06.57]Well, that was fucking sure was fun, wasn't it?
[16:10.07]This game's on Steam, by the way.
[16:15.87]This is a game that's on Steam.
[16:18.55]And, like, I... Alt-Enter doesn't work, unfortunately.
[16:24.18]I tried that earlier.
[16:26.34]Well, that was fun!
[16:27.06]Hey, wasn't that a fun fucking game?
[16:28.66]Time to play something else, because this, like, cannot be streamed.
[16:31.56]Apparently.
[16:34.63]Wonderful!
[16:35.47]Great fucking idea.
[16:37.23]Glad I did that shit.
[16:38.27]That was really fucking cool.
[16:41.65]But now we have to play something else because this is an un-streamable video game.
[16:45.01]Great.
[16:45.38]Good.
[16:46.16]So, I actually have a backup.
[16:48.60]I have a backup plan.
[16:49.42]I did not think we were going to have to do this this quickly.
[16:55.32]But this one might be worth skipping to.
[17:01.44]I'm going to give this one more try.
[17:05.14]And then we're skipping to the next game.
[17:08.96]By the way, how's the internet?
[17:09.96]You can't even tell because I haven't fucking been able to start the damn stream yet.
[17:12.70]Oh, this is so fucking irritating.
[17:18.58]All you guys got to hear was like the shitty porn music from this piece of fucking crap game that came out like 30 years ago.
[17:26.39]And it worked like... I'm fucking angry right now.
[17:32.41]Okay, hold on.
[17:37.36]No, there's a game we're gonna play we're gonna skip to in a second.
[17:39.68]I ain't gonna do this for more than fucking 10 more seconds.
[17:49.57]Okay, let's see.
[17:53.89]Nah, fuck it.
[17:54.51]We're just moving on.
[17:55.35]Like, fuck this.
[17:56.47]This is stupid.
[17:57.65]Time to move on.
[17:58.65]We're playing this fucking, like, choose-your-own-adventure fucking movie game.
[18:04.92]We're playing this choose your own adventure movie game.
[18:07.30]Hope you guys are ready.
[18:08.04]We're gonna like watch a movie right now Because OBS doesn't want to stream this so we're gonna we're gonna play something else Good thing I had this fucking backup This just came out today, and I was like well this looks fucking stupid so I bought it.
[18:30.11]It's called late shift
[18:33.68]Uh, cover your ears, because here comes like a fucking loud ass noise, I can guarantee you that.
[18:40.06]Here comes a very loud sound.
[18:41.92]I TOLD YOU!
[18:46.79]You can still fucking hear- Why?
[18:48.63]God, why do they do this shit?
[18:52.47]Who does this shit?
[18:54.95]Why do people do this?
[18:57.38]Will anybody fucking ever learn?
[19:04.91]What?
[19:06.07]It's been like 20 years of this shit.
[19:10.36]Seriously.
[19:16.92]I've lived more than 30 fucking years.
[19:20.72]And I'm telling you guys right now, no game company has ever fucking figured out that that's the dumbest thing they could do to somebody.
[19:30.71]I can't even fucking begin to explain how stupid that is.
[19:35.01]But anyways, here's the late shift.
[19:40.20]This game's gonna fucking suck.
[19:45.14]We're gonna watch a movie.
[19:46.58]Am I gonna get, like, banned from Twitch because I'm, like, watching a movie on stream?
[19:51.44]This is technically a video game.
[19:55.93]Alright, well, I gotta change a couple things.
[19:57.89]Bear with me here for a second, guys.
[19:58.97]I'm sorry about this shit.
[20:02.13]But, like, I was not expecting that game to not work.
[20:05.99]Like, to just not work at all.
[20:07.52]It worked, like, fucking 25 minutes ago.
[20:11.14]But, you know.
[20:12.48]Like, life sucks.
[20:14.12]Game sucks.
[20:16.00]Give me a minute.
[20:18.54]The late shift.
[20:23.26]Okay.
[20:26.18]Choose your own movie.
[20:30.46]That's to choose your own movie Alright, well that's a good title Alright, no more dicking around let's go No fuck somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[20:50.07]Here's the real pressing question.

[23:36.35]Alright, what do I have to do?
[23:39.07]I have to get... Get out of the fucking way.
[23:43.09]Achievement.
[23:43.93]Just through there.
[23:57.89]Can I turn the music down?
[23:59.11]Or is it going to be blasting this music the whole time?
[24:09.25]I can't even hear what they're saying.
[24:15.99]Alright, hold on.
[24:17.15]Settings.
[24:18.37]Volume at like 20, but like, that doesn't help.
[24:22.80]The music is so loud.
[24:23.74]This is gonna be kind of loud, guys.
[24:24.80]I'm just gonna warn you, but can we even hear anything?
[24:26.72]I guess, whatever.
[24:36.24]It's literally just a movie.
[24:37.48]Alright, I'm knocking over here.
[24:43.87]Directed by Tobias.
[24:52.53]Why is he standing up now?
[24:55.77]Wait, I can't hear anything.
[24:59.57]Alright, here we go.
[25:12.24]Lock the jacket door or open the jacket door?
[25:14.70]Which one is your decision?
[25:19.24]When do I get smash computer with fists?
[25:26.84]Hey, look.
[25:27.88]I'm part of the movie.
[25:28.66]Look, I'm on the screen.

[25:37.49]How annoying is this?
[25:41.65]Hold on.
[25:45.13]It's gotta be a little louder.
[25:46.11]I can't hear the fuck of what they're saying.
[25:51.31]Where are my choices?
[25:52.93]We got the typical dickhead.
[26:18.49]Remember this guy.
[26:19.77]That's the bad guy of the whole movie.
[26:22.37]That's the bad guy of the whole movie.
[26:24.77]What is going on in this game?
[26:27.69]Where's my decision?
[26:28.57]We're just watching a movie.
[26:47.71]Yeah, the choices are so small because there is none.
[26:58.63]This is a game.
[26:59.27]I promise this is a video game.
[27:01.07]Wait a minute.
[27:01.49]Oh, here we go.
[27:01.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27:02.33]We got a bad guy here.
[27:03.25]Here comes a decision.
[27:04.17]He's going to pull a gun.
[27:05.29]Oh, no, it's just a girl.
[27:06.81]Just a girl.
[27:07.23]Forget something.
[27:09.87]Not exactly.
[27:11.79]Um, I'm sorry about before.
[27:13.83]You know, just assuming like that.
[27:15.45]Oh, ignore him.
[27:17.05]He was being an arsehole.
[27:17.77]He was being an arsehole.
[27:19.31]I think your boyfriend's an arsehole.
[27:21.29]Don't you?
[27:22.17]Here we go.
[27:22.89]Here comes the choice.
[27:23.43]But, uh, he does have a nice car.
[27:25.41]I think your boyfriend's a bad guy.
[27:28.09]I don't think he's a bad guy.
[27:29.26]What am I reading?
[27:32.18]Uh, fuck it.
[27:33.38]Just like chemical engineering.

[27:46.10]Oh, should I give her the keys?
[27:49.18]Why?
[28:13.59]Why do you need that car so bad?
[28:19.99]Let me just go back to what I was doing, chemical engineering.
[28:22.62]How smart am I?
[28:23.64]I'm so desirable.

[32:42.60]DTA.
[32:43.38]I had a shirt that said it.
[32:50.83]Why did I just get in this car?
[32:58.36]Bad idea, bad idea.
[33:00.00]Look, something's come up.
[33:03.43]I need to take care of it first.
[33:06.19]Oh, fuck.
[33:06.91]This is good.
[33:08.25]Everybody just points a gun at you at this game.
[33:13.03]I'm a fucking streamer.
[33:14.29]I've got no money.
[33:16.23]My family's got no money.
[33:17.19]What am I doing?
[33:18.35]Please let me get out of the car.
[33:19.69]Please let me just roll out of the car and run.
[33:21.79]You know the guy broke into the garage, don't you?
[33:25.32]Oh, let me just tuck and roll out of the car.
[33:29.81]Oh, come on.
[33:35.82]Oh, what the fuck?
[33:37.66]Break the window and tuck and roll out.
[33:45.96]He just so nonchalantly pulled the gun up, too.
[33:49.60]Like, he didn't care.
[33:50.72]He's just like, yeah, I guess.
[33:52.86]I have a gun.
[33:54.94]I'm gonna have to aim it at you.
[33:56.38]Come on.
[34:02.35]Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[34:03.09]Just want to make sure you still know who's in charge here.
[34:06.23]That's right.
[34:06.83]Come up these stairs.
[34:08.59]How's your back?
[34:09.11]You still have that lumbar pain?
[34:17.23]Oh, there's another guy.
[34:18.81]Watch this guy pull up.
[34:19.85]That guy's got a gun!
[34:20.55]Why does everybody have to point a gun?
[34:21.83]This guy's not even holding a gun right.
[34:41.85]Jesus Christ.
[34:43.29]Who the hell is going to drive?
[34:44.75]Because you're clearly not.
[34:46.11]I'll be alright.
[34:47.03]Fucking idiot.
[34:50.21]It has to be four people.
[34:51.25]There is no way you can manage your assistant than anyone downstairs on your own.
[34:55.41]I'm well aware of how many people it has to be.
[34:56.91]I have to call it off.
[34:57.69]Do you want to tell Mr. Wu that we missed the one chance to get our hands on his phone?
[35:00.55]I hope I can run out.
[35:01.83]Give me the opportunity to run, please.
[35:04.85]Fine.
[35:06.31]How?
[35:08.25]Leave him to bleed.
[35:09.84]Need to make some calls and try and find a replacement in the next, shit, in the next 30 minutes.
[35:13.57]Call Dan if he doesn't pick up.
[35:14.75]Try and get hold of that Irish Pete.
[35:17.65]Run.
[35:19.95]What about him?
[35:22.71]Oh no, now I'm part of the crew.
[35:24.73]I don't care.
[35:25.21]I'm going to play it cool here.
[35:27.84]I'm not a murderer.
[35:28.48]I don't intend to start now.
[35:30.78]Pass me diphenoxine and a couple of cable ties.
[35:36.06]What does that even mean?
[35:38.76]You stay where you are.
[35:40.50]Steel up.
[35:41.44]No, I said I wouldn't kill you.
[35:43.12]There's lots of painful options.
[35:45.00]I was going to stay calm.
[35:51.55]Oh, wait.
[35:51.81]They're syringing me.
[35:53.47]They're pulling a hitman.
[35:54.89]For Christ's sake.
[35:55.79]This guy's going to have to do it.
[36:03.22]They were about to syringe me.
[36:04.14]Is that guy gonna give me Novocaine?
[36:05.98]What am I, like the dentist?
[36:06.98]Oh, God.
[36:07.22]Uh, what's in it for me?
[36:08.28]Am I still alive, by the way?
[36:34.49]I'm pushing this.
[36:36.52]I'm taking it.
[36:38.08]I can't see the chat, by the way.
[36:39.40]Did I lose my connection?
[36:40.70]Yeah, chat's dead for me.
[36:41.42]I hope my internet's not dead, too.
[36:57.03]Hold on, I gotta pause this for a second.
[36:58.57]I need to make sure I can see what people are saying.
[37:01.60]Uh... Huh?
[37:04.96]Why is my chat dead?
[37:08.52]Well, let's close that.
[37:09.72]One second, guys.
[37:10.40]I hope I'm still alive.
[37:12.92]I'd be fairly upset if I wasn't.
[37:18.25]Uh... Huh?
[37:22.05]Uh...
[37:24.45]Well, apparently I'm still live.
[37:27.36]Alright.

[37:49.24]So what do I do next?
[37:50.69]Do I go along with this and then try and turn them in?
[37:54.60]Do I keep my mouth shut and take the money?

[38:10.51]Your shit doesn't need to be this loud.
[38:13.21]What's with music?
[38:15.91]Why am I on board with this now?

[40:46.94]Katie.

[41:10.54]Somebody just gave a hundred bucks.
[41:11.72]Hold on.
[41:13.18]We're currently talking about like the eight dollar Creighton barrel.
[41:17.30]T-bull.
[41:18.44]Thank you very much indeed, Katie.
[41:20.48]It is a truly exceptional piece, the sale of which cannot be passed without remarking that its owner, Mr. Samuel Parr, who is far too modest to mention it himself, has agreed to donate 50% of the sale proceeds to the Chinese Art Restoration Fund.
[41:41.52]First of all, thank you ilovedonuts3 for the 100 bucks.
[41:44.32]Says, hey Jerry, I think I broke Twitch and Amazon during the banjo knockoff.

[43:44.79]Fuck this.
[43:46.69]Give me... Give me like 30 bucks, and I will go buy a little... a little teapot, and I'll just paint that for you.
[43:54.90]I'll do it for 40 bucks.
[43:55.78]You don't need to pay 10 million dollars for that.
[43:57.34]10-5.

[45:55.05]And then we're just going to get into combat.
[45:56.89]Jeffrey's going to call the left from downstairs.
[45:58.83]Okay, and then?
[45:59.75]Then you're going to take out the security guard.

[46:20.68]Let's play along.
[46:23.08]We're in too deep.
[46:23.98]We gotta play along.

[46:53.33]Where are we?
[46:53.89]I can't wait to do a chop on somebody's neck.
[46:57.39]What the hell is he holding?
[46:58.17]Was that a mirror?
[47:19.25]Alert the guards, or let this play out.
[47:21.38]I might not get another chance.

[47:38.31]Where did you come from?
[47:39.41]What's wrong with this?
[47:41.67]It's not your monitor, mate.
[47:43.05]There are thieves inside the building right now, and they've hacked into your security system.
[47:46.99]Oh, wow.
[47:47.79]Oh, this is crazy.
[47:48.89]Oh, he's got a syringe.
[47:53.07]Oh, shit, he's got a syringe up.
[47:54.93]No!
[47:56.03]What the fuck do you think you're doing?
[48:01.47]Well, hey, you're gonna... What are you...
[48:10.20]Oh shit!
[48:11.78]Not another innocent person!
[48:13.98]You don't have any more syringes!
[48:18.12]What did this guy do?
[48:36.09]It took so long to fucking choke that guy.
[48:38.71]That guy was getting choked for like three minutes.
[49:00.23]Was it a scented candle?
[49:01.59]Oh wait, that's the relic.
[49:06.26]Dude, you trusted a 12 million dollar relic with some random fucking busboy?
[49:12.06]Some random ass busboy had that in a little black container.
[49:16.24]You trust that 12 fucking million dollar piece with that little shit?
[49:19.53]Oh god, what?
[49:20.53]What was that?
[49:21.57]309 what?
[49:29.46]Oh, shit.
[49:31.12]I don't even know what it was.
[49:31.80]Oh.
[49:31.92]I'm such a piece of shit.
[49:33.10]What happened?
[49:33.82]Something must have happened.
[49:34.94]I'm just a nuisance.
[49:35.71]I'm just like a lazy nuisance.
[50:00.37]Why hasn't this guy shot me in the face?
[50:02.26]They brought me along in this like big heist and all I've been is just a pain in the ass.
[50:12.11]I haven't even tried.
[50:14.75]They were better off leaving me at the house.
[50:29.05]Who the fuck is that guy?
[50:33.50]Wait, that's the guy that we came with, isn't it?
[50:35.30]I thought I was just like, okay, I guess I'll come with you.
[50:45.03]This car's just sitting out here out front.
[50:57.15]And by the way, every like five minutes an achievement pops up that says choices matter.
[51:01.37]Here we go.
[51:06.01]This is the big climactic scene.
[51:07.53]I'm so sad.
[51:27.20]Why would you think you could trust me anyways?
[51:29.24]You met me 30 minutes ago.
[51:34.48]We haven't even eaten dinner yet.
[51:37.00]I don't know who the fuck you even are.
[51:41.84]Why would I think I could trust you, guy that I met 30 minutes ago?
[51:51.76]Fuck.
[51:51.96]Where are the others?
[51:53.02]In.
[51:54.28]Jeff, where are the others?
[51:55.73]Ask him.
[51:57.77]Let's get out of here.
[52:01.77]Look at, I was like so painfully uninvolved.
[52:05.98]That's the, that's the, we're going to go for painfully uninvolved.
[52:11.93]Any chance I get to just be... We just left that car, by the way.
[52:14.46]Nothing here.
[52:15.28]What the fuck?
[52:16.44]Nothing there.
[52:17.48]Ladies and gentlemen, we are back in society.
[52:20.70]Okay.
[52:21.40]It's a pretty nice green screen.
[52:23.68]We're not actually driving a car.
[52:24.84]I know that technique.
[52:26.28]Let me see it.
[52:28.39]I wanna see the bowl.
[52:29.23]Just wait.
[52:30.04]This thing stays in the bag until we get to Wu's place and it turns into money.
[52:32.82]Too fucking right.
[52:33.52]You wanna take a left?
[52:35.70]Some shortage high street.
[52:37.54]I gotta sabotage this.
[52:38.38]Sounds classy.

[52:42.27]Give him to me.
[52:43.63]I'll pop in.
[52:44.17]See?
[52:44.37]I'm like a comedian.
[52:47.29]No, we never speak.
[52:49.53]Not here.
[52:50.26]Just keep him quiet until we get rid of this bowl.
[52:52.87]There should be some gaffer type in the back somewhere.
[52:54.57]Oh, no, they're gonna like... What the... What?
[52:58.23]Wait, wait.
[53:02.13]Why would you be... Why would you be turned the fuck around while you're driving?
[53:08.07]What are you, Jim Carrey?
[53:10.27]This guy's talking about how much of a comedian I am.
[53:12.93]He just wasn't looking at the fucking road.
[53:17.51]Why?
[53:18.51]Why?
[53:19.62]Everybody's fucking dead.

[53:58.74]This game is a 10 out of 10 video game.
[54:04.10]Why am I saving these people?
[54:05.70]Get the bowl.
[54:06.66]That's all that matters.
[54:12.31]The car's just flipped over on fire.
[54:15.91]That was so outrageous.
[54:25.21]Oh no, they're all dead.
[54:30.23]Is the ball still okay?
[54:34.08]Hey, look at that.
[54:35.50]Yeah, it was wrapped in some bubble wrap.
[54:37.44]It's okay.
[54:39.42]Oh boy.
[54:42.32]I just heard an explosion.
[54:44.31]Can I just put that into my zipper in my pants?
[54:50.27]I stuffed that into my penis zipper.
[54:53.74]Uh, we're going to see Mr. Wolf.
[54:55.84]Alright, well, I'm leaving you.
[55:04.58]I'm leaving her.
[55:06.06]I am fucking bringing her.
[55:10.37]It's too late.
[55:12.41]Bye.
[55:13.87]You had your chance.
[55:14.95]Now you have to explain why this car flipped over.
[55:17.27]I'm sure the police will have a fucking ball listening to you explain your way out of this one.
[55:25.18]No, what?
[55:27.02]Of course, the choice... Leave her.
[55:29.12]No, I'm still going to come anyways.
[55:40.00]So, uh... Any good movies lately?
[55:43.58]Watch any good books?
[55:44.46]Uh-oh, she's activating the checkpoint.
[55:49.09]That's what she's doing.
[55:49.69]Yep, that was a save point.
[55:52.46]Make sure you, like, activate that fucking save point pillar.
[55:59.90]Still looks better in a suit than I do.
[56:01.46]Alright, let's keep going.
[56:22.01]Welcome to Hong Kong City.
[56:23.71]Table for two.
[56:25.67]Yes.
[56:26.70]We're here to see someone.
[56:28.14]Table for four.
[56:29.22]Four on me, please.
[56:30.72]Table for four?

[56:44.51]You're not even eating?
[56:46.41]No.
[56:47.84]He's Mr. Woo.
[56:48.22]That's Mr. Woo.
[56:49.48]Guaranteed.
[56:50.08]I bet you fucking trillion dollars that this is Mr. Woo.
[56:54.20]Memory clearing.
[57:10.27]He's gonna go, oh really?
[57:11.19]Let's go.
[57:11.43]He's gonna be in there, he's gonna be in there like snot and coke.
[57:14.29]See, there he is.
[57:38.19]What makes you believe you can just walk in here?
[57:43.13]That's Mr. Wolf.
[57:45.91]They're gonna pull a horrible boss on us.
[57:48.33]No, an undercover boss on us.
[57:52.33]Undercover boss has taught me anything.
[57:53.71]It's that the fucking most unlikely guy is the guy that runs the place.
[58:05.54]This is just a plant.
[58:06.44]This is not a real Mr. Wu.
[58:07.44]What's your business?
[58:08.10]Everybody always threatens you and doesn't do anything.
[58:15.55]Yeah, we found this.
[58:17.77]Cost $12 million.
[58:18.95]What'd he say?
[58:28.96]Why have you brought this here?
[58:30.12]What'd he say?
[58:30.50]Because we had a deal.
[58:33.56]I gotta pee.
[58:35.12]I have to pee real bad.
[58:36.80]It just crept up on me right now.
[58:38.70]So just keep in mind, just remember what you just watched.
[58:42.91]Because I gotta piss.
[58:44.71]I'll be right back.
[62:52.56]I'm back.
[62:53.40]Oh God.
[62:54.08]Ow.
[62:55.78]Ow.
[62:57.50]Sorry, that took a little longer than I thought.
[62:59.34]I had to make a new coffee and I peed for about 65 seconds.
[63:02.66]Alright, here we go.
[63:09.78]So last, well, we last left it.
[63:12.84]As you, as you are well, very much aware.
[63:16.70]We brought in the small piece.
[63:20.84]Here we go.
[63:21.16]Turn around and karate chop.
[63:22.96]I just spent all of my monitor.
[63:25.53]Fuck.
[63:25.69]Everybody has to point a gun at you.
[63:27.75]Why?
[63:27.91]Put the guns away.
[63:28.61]Why?
[63:44.68]Quite impressive.
[63:45.70]It's the same gun.
[63:46.42]They're choosing to steal it in the first place.
[63:49.84]You think they have more than one gun prop?
[63:51.34]It's nothing short of insanity.
[63:53.36]We stole this for you.
[63:54.70]I gave no such order.
[63:56.64]Not to you or anyone else.
[63:58.97]What?
[64:01.03]To steal that bowl is not only madness.
[64:03.21]The real Mr. Woof Woof.
[64:04.29]It is also suicide.
[64:07.99]To the Troy family, possession of that bowl is a question of honor.
[64:15.25]They have fought wars for it.
[64:18.57]When do I get to smash it?
[64:19.95]It's beyond measure.
[64:23.77]That was like so terrible.
[64:24.90]When do I get to smash it?
[64:26.28]They paid for it tonight.
[64:30.24]And I do not intend to add my life to the bill.
[64:35.46]He's the best actor of the whole series, by the way.
[64:36.94]Now get out!
[64:40.62]I don't believe you.
[64:42.22]If you know how much they paid...
[64:44.45]Then you know your 20% is a lot higher than you thought it would be.
[64:47.23]Fuck.
[64:48.78]He's like, oh, he figured me out.
[64:50.96]I did not order its theft.
[64:56.08]The only order I am giving is to you.
[64:59.19]Get out of my restaurant.
[65:04.57]Nope.
[65:05.94]No.
[65:06.88]Fuck you.
[65:08.10]You owe us money and you know it.
[65:09.66]No, I ain't gonna.
[65:10.48]You made a deal for this.
[65:11.76]Take it.
[65:12.30]We don't want it.
[65:13.58]Goodbye.
[65:15.18]We will not meet again.
[65:17.02]Just dub the movie.
[65:19.70]Okay, fine.
[65:20.50]Alright, fine.
[65:22.15]You got it.
[65:23.87]You guys ready?
[65:29.13]Good luck.
[65:32.49]Fine.
[65:33.81]Just listen for one second.
[65:39.85]Yeah, come this way.
[65:41.89]Well, that bowl is worth a lot of money.
[65:43.89]That bowl is... Stay out!
[65:47.43]And don't ever come back!
[65:48.85]Oh, fine.
[65:49.81]Unbelievable.
[65:51.13]Can you believe that fucking wanker?
[65:56.21]Oh.
[65:58.53]Nobody said anything.
[66:06.39]I don't understand.
[66:09.13]You don't understand?
[66:11.93]Why haven't you said more than one sentence this whole time?
[66:15.59]You think we can actually get away with this?
[66:21.39]Yes, I do.
[66:22.18]I really believe that.
[66:23.32]No, you can't believe that.
[66:24.82]Did you see what Mr. Wu said in there?
[66:26.74]He said we were dead.
[66:27.58]No, I'm leaving.
[66:29.58]You can't leave.
[66:31.77]We don't- I fucking can't do it with this.
[66:34.67]It's too hard to rig the lips.
[66:36.64]They're not talking enough.
[66:38.84]We're not doing that shit right now.
[66:44.26]But I- I don't- whatever.
[66:46.40]Okay.
[66:48.30]Okay, let's go.
[66:51.60]No, the whole goal was trying to like fucking say what- But they didn't speak for like fucking 35 seconds.
[67:05.10]Great joke.
[67:07.12]Well, I tried.
[67:09.14]Wasn't working tonight.
[67:09.98]They both had nothing to say.
[67:11.04]Well, they still have nothing to say.
[67:16.92]How am I supposed to reliably dub a conversation where they both just stare at each other and open their mouths?
[67:26.03]Dude, that whole time, they like opened their mouths to say words and then didn't do it.
[67:29.73]It threw me off.
[67:42.00]At this point we're too invested in the story for jokes.
[67:45.51]That's true.
[67:59.07]Voice the subtitles?
[68:00.09]No.
[68:07.06]Where's my choice?
[68:10.70]Did you believe me?
[68:12.75]Yeah.
[68:13.29]Yeah, that's not what I asked you.
[68:17.81]I love how the music volume is so loud and you just can't hear anything else.
[68:22.45]Like, fucking holy shit game.
[68:23.95]Come on.
[68:25.53]There's no music volume?
[68:26.63]Is this just volume?
[68:27.69]I didn't watch this conversation, mate.
[68:32.11]I don't know.
[68:33.48]I thought we were delivering the ball for 20% job done.
[68:37.03]I should be back at home by now soaking in the bath.
[68:40.26]Oh, by the way, before we keep going, Sterma985 gave $5.
[68:44.60]Please put the subtitles back on.
[68:46.14]I did, I did.
[68:47.62]Uh, Sterma985 also gave $11.
[68:49.67]You are the real MVP of the heist.
[68:51.85]Thank you, Sterma.
[68:52.97]ILoveDonutsAgain gave $50 and says, This is Jerma's book.
[68:56.91]They just made it into a game.
[68:58.79]I wish.
[68:59.83]I fucking wish that were the case.
[69:02.03]But, thank you so much for the $50, ILoveDonuts.
[69:04.91]You've given quite a lot of money.
[69:07.13]Quigsy, thanks for the $5.
[69:07.93]They say, Jerma, you can't end the movie early no matter how hard you try.
[69:12.98]Imagine you could just die in the first scene.
[69:19.09]Anyways, thank you Baked Flakes for the 60 bucks 20 minutes ago or so.
[69:25.63]Go make a bowl and flip it for 15 million dollars.
[69:28.01]I Love Donuts again gave 30 bucks earlier.
[69:32.98]Thank you, I Love Donuts.
[69:34.42]Thanks to everybody.
[69:35.74]You guys are fucking great.
[69:38.50]Shit.
[69:41.50]Who cares?
[69:43.41]Why is no one trying to contact us?
[69:48.67]We're gonna start kissing or something, watch.
[69:49.77]I knew it!
[69:50.07]I knew it!
[69:50.71]Why would we start kissing here?
[69:52.13]Like, why did you do that?
[69:52.85]Why did you do that?
[69:53.33]No, I'm a conservative man.
[69:54.60]I'm going to have to excuse me.
[69:55.70]I like to take things slowly.
[70:18.09]I need to make sure I'm in the right mindset and I'm really, I'm into the woman that I want to fall in love with.
[70:23.10]I'm withdrawing.
[70:24.16]I'm a little bit conservative in the bedroom.
[70:26.34]My sauce.
[70:36.50]Ten million.
[70:37.04]Yeah.
[70:37.14]Somebody tipped off the cops.
[70:38.38]Meh.
[71:02.48]What about the guy in the background here?
[71:04.33]Nope.
[71:04.59]Nope.
[71:04.85]Yeah, that car is still on fire.
[71:06.15]Did you see the way the guy was smiling?
[71:07.97]That was a really weird picture.
[71:09.19]And there's the bowl.
[71:10.49]We still have it.
[71:30.42]Give me a decision.
[71:30.84]Explain or ask?
[71:32.30]Wait, he's dead?
[71:32.66]When do we get a weapon?
[71:34.62]Oh no.
[72:01.87]Hello?
[72:02.89]Mr. Smith?
[72:04.09]Yep.
[72:04.71]I have some people in the reception.
[72:06.61]Shall I send them out?
[72:07.55]Sure.
[72:08.59]Sure.
[72:10.01]Can we please stay and let them come?
[72:11.30]Oh, come on.
[72:12.92]I want to just lie on the bed sprawled.
[72:16.28]Window.
[72:18.14]We're getting out of the window.
[72:22.16]Come on.
[72:23.18]Break this fucking window.
[72:24.10]We're not going downstairs.
[72:25.00]Okay.
[72:32.92]What?
[72:33.58]Wait.
[72:34.34]Why?
[72:34.70]Wait a sec.
[72:38.34]That should not... What is this, like Willy Wonka's Candy Land?
[72:41.86]You can just, like, grab shit and pull it off?
[72:46.66]What an obvious set piece.
[72:50.30]I'm glad I, like, fucking ripped off the candy cane and, like, budged up the lock.
[72:55.48]Oh, no.
[72:57.32]We have guns.
[72:57.92]We're holding up guns like everybody else.
[73:02.89]Trust me.
[73:07.79]Please.
[73:10.11]Trust.
[73:11.11]That was the bull.
[73:12.45]That was the bull.
[73:13.59]That was so anticlimactic.
[73:14.67]I wasn't even prepared for that.
[73:16.72]I wasn't even prepared for that.
[73:17.78]That was the fucking bull.
[73:21.30]What?
[73:21.56]Slow down.
[73:25.93]I can't believe you just did that.
[73:27.97]After everything you've been through tonight, you destroyed the bowl just like that.
[73:30.79]Just stop, will you?
[73:31.75]Wait, it was a fake bowl.
[73:32.61]They're going to fucking kill us.
[73:33.75]Yep, she has a fake bowl.
[73:34.93]Yeah, with you it never is.
[73:36.53]Right, she's going to pull the bowl out.
[73:39.59]It was a fake bowl.
[73:44.40]That had to have been a hotel bowl, right?
[73:46.68]You destroyed the one thing that was keeping us alive.
[73:49.44]The one thing.
[73:51.00]Why would you do that?
[73:52.86]It's total madness.
[73:53.66]Tell me why.
[73:57.21]Come on, you had to have had a double bowl, like a magic trick, right?
[74:00.25]Because it was a fake.
[74:01.79]See?
[74:02.02]I knew it, she had a fake.
[74:06.44]The bowl was fake.
[74:07.84]Yes, she used a fake bowl and we still have the real one.
[74:12.22]I don't know.
[74:13.26]How did you... You lost it.
[74:14.30]How did you know it was a fake?
[74:15.20]You lost the bowl.
[74:17.68]Because I'm the one who watched it.
[74:20.52]Wait.
[74:21.62]Fuck.
[74:22.44]Oh wait, they're talking about like... Okay, they're not talking about on the surface here.
[74:28.45]We can still get the real one back and trade it for our lives.
[74:31.45]But I need your help to get it.
[74:33.59]Please, you have to trust me.
[74:36.25]Trust you?
[74:37.95]Oh, I'm sorry, am I hearing you right now?
[74:42.31]No way.
[74:47.27]Nope.
[74:48.07]Yeah, they're after her.
[74:50.87]I'm out.
[74:52.39]This is my out.
[74:55.79]Take, Granny Bacon.
[74:56.89]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[74:58.03]Use this to buy a new cereal bowl.
[74:59.58]I will.
[75:00.40]Thank you, Granny.
[75:00.98]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[75:04.60]That is incredibly generous.
[75:06.24]You're welcome.
[75:06.62]Thank you.
[75:07.12]This is nothing.
[75:09.66]Like, fuck off.
[75:10.96]Leave me alone.
[75:13.13]There is nothing you can say to get me to trust you.
[75:15.97]Not now.
[75:17.01]You can't do this on your own, Matt.
[75:18.47]Yes, I can.
[75:18.89]I think your percentages can help you.
[75:20.93]It's people that count, not numbers.
[75:22.53]How did she know I was a chemical engineer?
[75:24.15]Not numbers you can rely on.
[75:25.59]She shouldn't know this.
[75:26.21]Matt, it must be Pa who's behind this.
[75:28.81]I just don't care anymore.
[75:30.47]He fucked us all.
[75:31.03]Help me get evil with him.
[75:33.23]We can put this way.
[75:35.83]For both of us.
[75:36.73]See ya.
[75:36.93]Nah, it's just noise now, Mayling.
[75:41.21]See ya later.
[75:42.21]Goodbye.
[75:43.51]Yeah.
[75:44.67]Goodbye.
[75:46.65]We ain't fucking around with this lady anymore.
[75:50.45]Don't follow me either.
[75:56.47]He could have gone like under that or over it.
[75:58.47]I would have gone under it.
[75:59.35]Oh, here we go.
[76:00.64]Another car is rolling up on us.
[76:02.36]Get it!
[76:16.34]Are these the guys that threw the... What kind of terrible piece of shit fight is this?
[76:27.41]Punch him in the face, quick.
[76:32.29]Right in the face.
[76:34.31]Got him!
[76:36.31]Nice.
[76:36.99]Instantly knocked out.
[76:38.15]The other guys were doing like a tug of war over there.
[76:40.26]Oh, baby.
[76:45.88]Here we go.
[76:46.36]Let's harangue around, Anakin.
[76:48.42]Yes, Anakin.
[76:50.24]Oh, let the hate flow through you.
[76:53.18]Yes.
[76:54.46]Ow.
[76:56.52]Fight all three of them.
[77:00.92]What was the point of that?
[77:08.24]That served no purpose.
[77:09.46]It was just a bunch of drunk guys, and I fought one of them.
[77:15.70]Nice default avatar.
[77:17.78]Weren't the police coming behind me with the sirens?
[77:24.08]What happened there?
[77:45.21]There were sirens behind me, a cop car right behind me, about to come over to me.
[77:49.73]They watched me beat a guy almost to death.
[77:51.95]And they didn't do anything.
[78:01.02]I hope this person has a gun.
[78:06.28]Please turn around with a gun and be like, you're coming with me.
[78:10.86]I'm also a double-crosser main character.
[78:20.21]What do you mean no choice?
[78:27.39]Here comes the loud ass music.
[78:30.61]Fantastic.
[78:41.42]Yep.
[78:43.64]Mandatory drive around contemplation scene.
[78:48.05]Very important.
[78:54.55]Hey, remember that.
[78:55.03]That's going to be a code for a door later.
[78:56.31]I swear to God, that's going to be a code for a door.
[78:59.60]Whose house is this?
[79:06.48]Is this my house?
[79:07.22]Have I finally got to go home?
[79:08.24]I don't even know where I am right now.
[79:16.61]Good morning.
[79:17.05]An appointment with Samuel Powell?
[79:19.27]Mr. Parr does not receive guests before 10 o'clock.
[79:22.17]I want to see him, and I want to see him right now.
[79:24.53]What is going in?
[79:25.69]Wait here.
[79:27.47]That was very easy.
[79:28.71]That was extremely easy.
[79:30.45]What if I was a dangerous motherfucker?
[79:31.91]Thank you.
[79:32.63]Well, I'll take my tea in the study today.
[79:35.89]She did not put up very much resistance there.
[79:38.14]He does not see.
[79:38.80]Come on in.
[79:42.06]Are you intruded at the crack of dawn, my friend?
[79:44.54]I assume it's urgent.
[79:46.07]I want the original.
[79:47.47]Original of what?
[79:48.73]You know what I'm talking about.
[79:51.27]Do enlighten me.
[79:52.04]The rice bowl.
[79:53.86]The fucking rice bowl.
[79:55.32]If you're referring to the rice bowl you bestowed her from Hainsworth last night, that piece is going to be lost forever, I fear.
[80:01.94]That's not true, though, is it?
[80:04.57]He's got it.
[80:04.85]Because what was stolen was a copy.
[80:07.49]The original is safe and in your possession.
[80:09.29]He has it.
[80:10.25]And you are?
[80:11.21]Matt.
[80:12.12]You can call me Matt.
[80:12.90]Hey, Matt.
[80:13.64]Nice to meet you.
[80:14.70]Mr. Matt.
[80:17.17]How did you come by this extraordinary theory?
[80:19.51]I know that Mayling forged a copy for you.
[80:20.97]I'm going through his underwear drawer and finding it.
[80:22.93]It's in his underwear drawer.
[80:23.63]Do you have proof to back up this outrageous slander?
[80:27.05]I don't need proof, mate.
[80:28.75]We're not in court, are we?
[80:30.09]I know what I know, yeah?
[80:31.39]That you fucked up my life for a piece of fucking pottery.
[80:34.89]Language, dear boy.
[80:37.91]Don't get confused.
[80:42.23]Okay, here we go.
[80:43.89]Smash his head with a golf club.
[80:46.17]Oh, you got it.
[80:46.71]That's what I'm doing.
[80:47.21]I didn't choose that.
[80:48.59]I didn't choose to... I didn't choose to do that.
[80:50.23]He did that on his own.
[80:51.25]He's becoming sentient.
[80:55.33]He's becoming... He has a mind of his own now.
[81:16.08]Why am I walking like a GTA character?
[81:19.83]This is how a GTA character walks when he has a weapon in his hand.
[81:22.95]Since it was stolen, I've lost track.
[81:25.97]It's the truth.
[81:28.63]I don't even care.
[81:30.61]I'm not leaving here without that fucking bomb.
[81:32.93]I don't know where it is.
[81:34.43]Use force, a.k.a.
[81:35.85]scare the old guy by holding your hands in the air.
[81:38.48]I'll destroy everything in here.
[81:42.72]Make the old man flinch.
[81:44.00]I love when I choose him to do it, he won't do it, but he'll do it on his own.
[81:52.28]Oh, God!
[82:14.45]Oh my god, this is terrible.
[82:15.29]Ah, I got it.
[82:15.99]I got the info.
[82:16.73]Yeah, open up the safe.
[82:18.99]This guy's not even hurt.
[82:34.74]I hit this guy with a fucking golf club, and he's like, it's alright, I'm okay.
[82:39.79]Excuse me.
[82:40.49]Out of the way.
[82:41.61]Excuse me.
[82:42.07]Yep.
[82:43.01]Get out of the way.
[82:45.15]There's probably a gun in there.
[82:46.53]Yeah, see?
[82:46.77]Yep.
[82:46.93]I knew it.
[82:48.47]That wouldn't even hurt.
[83:03.33]That wouldn't even hurt.
[83:04.07]Shoot him.
[83:04.93]Give me the fucking bow.
[83:07.93]Gun in the safe.
[83:09.27]Ah, the classic gun in the safe.
[83:11.24]So you kill me for it?
[83:12.80]You wouldn't be the first to die for it.
[83:14.42]There have been many of you before.
[83:17.04]You have your fucking mind.
[83:18.37]So glad I have a gun.
[83:21.79]Shoot him!
[83:23.11]Fuck you.
[83:27.80]He's fine!
[83:28.46]He's f- He just like put his finger- He's still alive!
[83:33.80]He just put his finger up my nose!
[83:43.22]Why did he come and like, grab my face?
[83:48.40]Hey, he was gonna kill me.
[83:49.66]Oh shit!
[83:50.64]Oh shit.
[83:51.20]Oh, what do I do?
[83:51.92]What do I do?
[83:53.98]No, oh shit!
[83:54.76]What do I do?
[83:58.65]Oh, we're on a dark... Oh, God!
[84:01.65]No, she has nothing to do with this!
[84:03.65]It was the old man that stole the jewelry!
[84:09.26]She's, like, listening.
[84:12.52]We're gonna get the bad ending.
[84:16.64]Open up his stomach.
[84:17.78]He ate the bowl.
[84:24.12]Okay, let's be... We're gonna be real.
[84:26.04]I'm gonna be honest here.
[84:27.86]This guy was gonna shoot me.
[84:29.26]This guy was gonna kill me.
[84:30.82]He was gonna open that safe, grab the gun and shoot me.
[84:33.18]I had to do that.
[84:34.72]I didn't have to do it, but like... And then I shot him once and he came and grabbed my face.
[84:38.90]He put his finger in my nose.
[84:39.88]I had to shoot him again.
[84:44.98]You used scotch tape.
[84:48.77]You used scotch tape.
[84:51.35]I just realized that.
[84:54.42]Dude, scotch tape is designed to seal envelopes.
[84:57.24]Uh-oh.
[85:09.32]The ball.
[85:10.22]You have it.
[85:11.20]Where?
[85:13.06]That was... Wait, what?
[85:15.24]What?
[85:16.64]You're dying.
[85:17.64]The girl can still live.
[85:19.42]Where's her ball?
[85:21.32]Did I lose?
[85:21.88]I lost.
[85:23.42]That's the end.
[85:26.51]I lost the game.
[85:27.17]The end.
[85:27.35]I don't think I did it right.
[85:28.35]I don't think I did it right.
[85:55.54]Can I go back and like redo it?
[86:05.71]Can I rewind to like before the old man?
[86:15.91]Okay, like I want to like do that again.
[86:18.83]I want to do that again.
[86:22.54]What about the save point?
[86:23.34]Remember when she put her hand on the save point?
[86:29.43]I spent too much time in the old man.
[86:31.01]Like, he was gonna shoot me.
[86:31.95]I should have shot him and ran away.
[86:38.67]Of course you did.
[86:39.51]You died.
[86:40.24]Your choices were off.
[86:42.42]Alright, that was, like, that was fun.
[86:47.04]That was actually, like, pretty fun.
[86:48.40]But this game's 10 bucks, by the way.
[86:54.06]You know, for like, for 10 bucks, there's a bunch of different ways to do it.
[86:59.74]I mean, it might be like pretty linear and like dumb.
[87:03.32]But shit's 10 bucks.
[87:06.26]It's on Steam.
[87:08.02]I wish I could skip this.
[87:11.35]Please tell me that this is going to give me like a skippable thing.
[87:22.37]Better than a Telltale game?
[87:23.83]No, that was fucking cool.
[87:26.74]That was like, I liked this.
[87:32.82]I like inherently enjoyed this.
[87:34.37]There's like 20 endings.
[87:42.59]Really?
[87:43.95]Okay.
[87:46.85]Do we, like, go back?
[87:51.92]Can't skip.
[87:52.48]We have to watch everything.
[87:55.50]A lot of people worked on this, apparently.
[88:01.13]I'm going to turn this volume down while we sit here and figure this out.
[88:05.71]Alright.
[88:09.17]There are 7 to... I thought it was 17.
[88:10.57]I don't know why I said 17.
[88:13.45]7 endings.
[88:14.95]So I got, obviously, the worst ending.
[88:18.58]So I wonder, like, when this is over, do I unlock a super fast mode?
[88:25.14]Is it like a chapter system or something?
[88:26.42]I can go back?
[88:31.84]Just Google the endings.
[88:39.24]It was great.
[88:42.62]The game... Yeah, but that's the point.
[88:43.82]The game is just like a giant unskippable cutscene.
[88:46.00]That's like the whole point of the game.
[88:47.44]But you get to pick what cutscenes you want to watch.
[88:51.02]Anyways, thank you, Mitchell, for the 20 bucks.
[88:53.94]Achievement unlocked.
[88:54.66]Worst ending.
[88:55.36]Thanks for being wicked stupid.
[88:57.35]Can't play games tonight due to dry eye, but you made it enjoyable.
[89:00.01]Well, I hope your eye feels better.
[89:01.51]Thank you for watching.
[89:03.77]Uh... Kuzon gave three bucks.
[89:08.79]Cab driver was the gorilla.
[89:11.27]That would have been funny.
[89:15.06]You died in that one.
[89:15.96]Try another.
[89:17.76]Also, thank you, Sticktronicade, for the five bucks.
[89:20.82]You gave it earlier.
[89:21.66]Thank you.
[89:23.73]Special effects... I thought that just said sex.
[89:26.13]Special effects.
[89:27.15]Sex.
[89:27.61]Phil Anderson was the guy that filled in to have sex with people.
[89:33.02]I'm really hoping for, like, a chapter system.
[89:35.38]If it don't exist, then whatever.
[89:39.39]We're really hoping for that, though.
[89:43.23]Try again, but don't get in the car.
[89:47.81]The real ending is when you get banned from watching movies on Twitch.
[89:52.55]Holy shit, there's a lot of people in this.
[89:58.44]That was your punishment.
[89:59.56]Damn!
[90:06.10]It's like, this is a lot.
[90:10.87]Come on, we gotta get to the end where it shows the final screen.
[90:16.37]I can't skip it.
[90:17.61]All I can do is that.
[90:18.85]But I don't want to.
[90:19.53]Alright, here we go.
[90:24.85]Nope.
[90:25.27]We still got more.
[90:28.74]There is an ending when people have sex.
[90:30.42]Well, hopefully I don't get it.
[90:34.46]I was close to the true end.
[90:35.68]I was.
[90:37.34]Special thanks.
[90:41.42]Dude.
[90:42.40]Dude, there's gonna be... There's gonna be an after the credits scene.
[90:47.10]Just wait.
[90:48.10]And I'm gonna get one more choice.
[90:53.04]The last choice is gonna be the most important one.
[90:54.98]I'm gonna wake up.
