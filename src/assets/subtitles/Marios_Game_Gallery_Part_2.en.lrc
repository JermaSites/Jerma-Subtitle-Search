[00:01.38]What the hell was the name of this game?
[00:02.92]It wasn't Mario Yahtzee, it was something else.
[00:05.88]What was it called?
[00:09.38]It was like Mario's Game Night or something.
[00:11.81]Mario's Game Time.
[00:21.97]What the hell was this thing called?
[00:26.94]Mario Game Gallery?
[00:33.89]Yeah, it was called Mario's Game Gallery.
[00:36.21]That's the one.
[00:38.61]Thank you.
[00:49.91]Let's play some Yahtzee, Mario.
[00:58.72]What's that buzzing sound?
[01:00.98]I don't know.
[01:02.54]What is that buzzing sound?
[01:04.41]Interplay.
[01:07.62]Along with Presage proudly present... There it is.
[01:15.66]That wasn't... Mario's Game Gallery.
[01:20.16]I don't know why this sounds so harsh right now.
[01:24.29]How about a nice game of checkers?
[01:32.88]Let me get the bits from last night.
[01:45.73]What the fuck is happening?
[01:50.89]Let's get this over here.
[01:52.25]Sorry.
[01:54.69]This is from all the way back.
[01:57.69]I think I can get them all on here.
[02:16.65]Uh, I know there's a way I can get this.
[02:21.86]Because this is from earlier today, but how do I get them from yesterday?
[02:30.50]Oh, the delay too, yeah, you're right.
[02:33.42]I gotta get rid of that.
[02:36.19]Should be gone now.
[02:39.13]Yeah, I'm on the jermaMustard side, but where, um... How do I pull from yesterday?
[02:47.30]Minimum bits.
[02:49.13]Minimum, uh... Oh, where are they?
[02:52.97]The restore button.
[02:54.15]Oh, okay, right.
[02:54.71]Alright, here we go.
[02:56.41]So these are the bits from yesterday.
[03:00.45]We're gonna start at the bottom here.
[03:04.11]And we're gonna play Mario Yachty.
[03:10.40]I know you are, Mario.
[03:11.62]Just wait a minute.
[03:16.36]I know you are.
[03:18.42]Hold on, Mario.
[03:22.22]I actually need to do this.
[03:27.38]Sorry.
[03:29.80]Alright, here we go.
[03:33.82]He's freaking me out.
[03:41.92]It is this one.
[03:44.69]I gotta pull the Chrome window, dude.
[03:47.24]I know, Mario!
[03:48.38]Just wait, Mario!
[03:50.00]I'm trying!
[03:55.44]Going from PS3 to, like, capture Windows.
[04:00.83]There he is.
[04:02.75]Hey, Mario.
[04:04.23]There he is!
[04:05.03]I told you guys you'd see him!
[04:14.66]Okay.
[04:19.16]Hi, Mario.
[04:19.74]Alright, so let's go back while I do Yahtzee.
[04:26.61]Yahtzee.
[04:28.75]Is it loud?
[04:30.87]It's not that loud, right?
[04:35.37]So we're just going to go through.
[04:36.28]This is from yesterday.
[04:40.30]Thank you to Walrus Incarnation for the five dolls.
[04:43.32]They say, you're probably the only streamer I'm going to cheer for, to be honest.
[04:48.52]Well, thank you.
[04:49.21]I appreciate that.
[04:51.85]I really appreciate the fact that you'd give me any money at all.
[04:55.37]Thank you.
[04:59.61]Fusroboto, thank you for the five dolls.
[05:03.11]They say, pee-pee-poo-poo butthole.
[05:05.83]Great!
[05:10.00]I don't have any way to respond to that, other than what I just said.
[05:13.86]He's got three threes.
[05:18.51]Three ones, I mean.
[05:19.59]Let's go.
[05:25.25]Thank you, C4G, for the 250.
[05:26.49]With the release of the new Hearthstone expansion, will we see the triumphant return of Jerma985 as the number one Hearthstone streamer on Twitch?
[05:33.00]Looking forward to the comeback of the Chicken League champion.
[05:37.12]Uh, no.
[05:37.86]I don't think I'm ever going to play Hearthstone ever again.
[05:44.01]Should I go for the sixes?
[05:47.31]I could just take choice right now.
[05:51.01]What do you guys think?
[05:58.18]I'm just going to take choice.
[05:58.98]Or roll the fours.
[06:10.66]I'll try a fours.
[06:11.18]What are the fives?
[06:19.24]This is not good.
[06:20.08]I should have just taken the choice.
[06:20.98]I should have listened to my gut.
[06:23.01]Should have listened to my... Could I get a straight here, though?
[06:26.77]One.
[06:27.29]Do I need a two?
[06:28.45]I could roll the threes.
[06:29.49]Should I just roll the threes?
[06:31.81]It's not going to be fours.
[06:36.26]I'm going for the threes.
[06:41.72]Alright, that's good for me, okay?
[06:45.37]No four of a kind.
[06:46.63]No, not with threes.
[06:48.37]Three, that's pretty damn good.
[06:51.15]Uh, Sergio Butt.
[06:54.93]Thank you, Sergio Butt, for the 250.
[06:56.01]I've been sick for the past few days and I had to miss work.
[06:58.17]I've been living off your VODs to help me feel better.
[07:00.23]Thanks.
[07:02.23]Get better soon.
[07:05.87]Thank you for the 250, Sergio.
[07:07.51]This was yesterday, but hopefully you're feeling better.
[07:10.85]What'd you just do?
[07:12.33]What an idiot.
[07:13.81]13.
[07:15.86]Killer Crocomire, $50 from yesterday.
[07:18.16]5,000 bits earlier yesterday night.
[07:23.02]Uh... Straight?
[07:29.25]2, 3, 4... Oh, no, I'll go backwards.
[07:32.55]6, 5, 4, 3, 2.
[07:34.51]I need a 4.
[07:34.89]I'm going for it.
[07:43.57]Four.
[07:47.81]Not a four.
[07:48.41]That's not a four.
[07:50.71]Four.
[07:55.04]Shit.
[07:57.56]It's alright.
[08:02.24]Do I just take the two here?
[08:09.70]Twos are... I'm going to take the two.
[08:15.56]Because aces, why would I do that?
[08:20.52]KillerKrokomar, thank you so much for the $50.
[08:21.74]Some of you guys give $50 all the fucking time.
[08:26.94]And all I can say is thanks.
[08:31.50]He's going to get $6 here, isn't he?
[08:32.66]Thank you, DemonicCucumber for the $2.50.
[08:33.95]Hey, Jerma.
[08:35.45]Haven't been able to catch a stream recently, so it's nice to be able to laugh along with chat again.
[08:39.89]He's going to get $6.
[08:43.69]Let's not do it.
[08:47.03]That's alright.
[08:47.49]I'll take it.
[08:49.83]Uh, but they say, anyway, seeing as Minecraft has made a comeback recently, wondering if you'd ever consider going back to it for a playthrough.
[08:55.55]I genuinely like to see that in a non-jokey way.
[08:59.10]Anyway, love the stuff, man.
[09:00.00]Keep it up.
[09:02.92]I don't know.
[09:03.36]I don't think I'll ever go back to Minecraft.
[09:08.04]It's really... Okay, done.
[09:08.98]Done.
[09:14.41]Um, no.
[09:16.93]VR was different because it was VR, and it was VR Minecraft, and it was something I hadn't seen before.
[09:25.35]He's gonna get a straight.
[09:27.41]That's alright.
[09:34.18]But probably not.
[09:34.96]Not unless there was a very significant reason to go back to do it.
[09:44.00]Let's just try to get some ones here.
[09:46.70]But thank you for the 250.
[09:49.14]Uh, thank you, Life Pies, for the five bucks.
[09:54.09]Should I maybe change this to four?
[09:56.43]Go for a full house?
[09:57.35]No, that's a terrible full house.
[09:59.61]I might change it to four, though.
[10:00.97]But that's risky.
[10:01.69]That's too risky, because I only have two.
[10:07.49]No.
[10:08.19]I'm just gonna do the ones.
[10:11.99]Uh, but Life Pies, thanks for the five dollars.
[10:18.25]No message, just five bucks.
[10:19.56]Thank you.
[10:20.66]Uh, Chunky Baloney gave $50.
[10:24.88]I remember catching this one, though, because he said, uh, this is my kind of chunky stream.
[10:30.42]I talked about, like, I don't know, diapers or something, whatever.
[10:33.50]We talked about diapers, like, fucking five out of every ten streams.
[10:38.99]Thank you, though.
[10:41.15]Dead Medic, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[10:42.31]Hey, Jerma, as someone who's never played Terraria before, it's been a lot of fun watching your playthroughs and learning the game alongside you.
[10:49.15]You're doing great.
[10:49.91]You should hunt down the Flamelash.
[10:51.75]Yeah, I'm gonna.
[10:54.39]I'm gonna try to get that thing.
[10:56.87]Is Diaper still banned?
[10:59.40]Can anybody write that word?
[11:05.34]Oh, it still is?
[11:07.46]That's funny.
[11:09.41]No, not anymore.
[11:10.51]Oh, is it?
[11:11.39]As it should be?
[11:13.49]Well, we've got a... I'm going for it.
[11:18.09]Give me a huge full house here.
[11:21.89]Give me a five, give me a six.
[11:23.27]This is the best full house you can possibly get in the whole game.
[11:25.35]Let's see it.
[11:32.65]Damn it.
[11:38.33]Oh well.
[11:39.67]But yeah, Terraria is great.
[11:42.87]I've been having a great time with it.
[11:46.31]I'm at least going to play to the end of the game.
[11:49.83]Star and I will continue to do it.
[11:51.54]It's something you'll see on the channel for at least the foreseeable few weeks, I think.
[11:58.14]It's fun to learn, though.
[12:02.38]Also, purple rose tattoo, thanks to the five dolls.
[12:06.70]Just wanted to say, I'm going through some substance abuse recovery, and your content is helping distract me from the pains of DT and want to drink.
[12:17.75]I'm really sorry to hear you're going through that.
[12:24.97]I don't have any personal experience with dealing with something like substance abuse, but I've heard it's very, very difficult.
[12:33.39]Take care of yourself.
[12:34.45]Wish you the best.
[12:40.04]And if my content, if this community can help you with anything, I'm fucking very happy that you can have a place here to relax.
[12:49.53]Thank you, though.
[12:50.61]Good luck.
[12:51.59]Keep at it and take care of yourself.
[12:53.55]Thank you, Purple Rose Tattoo.
[12:54.57]Thanks for the five dollars.
[12:55.28]Okay, where are we at here?
[13:01.72]What do I want to do here?
[13:04.24]Roll the two?
[13:05.56]No, I have to roll the fours.
[13:14.13]No, it's a small straight.
[13:17.43]A big straight would be... What's the difference between small and a big?
[13:22.46]Oh, right, because it's only four.
[13:24.98]Five is the big straight, right?
[13:27.70]How close am I to that?
[13:29.88]Four, five, six.
[13:31.36]I need a two.
[13:32.28]I could do it.
[13:34.76]I need a two.
[13:35.98]Come on, Mario.
[13:37.32]Give it to me.
[13:48.20]What's going on with my life right now?
[13:54.65]Two, three, four, five, six.
[13:56.23]Okay, I need a two.
[13:58.49]Here it comes.
[14:00.05]It's gonna be a two.
[14:05.65]Told you.
[14:16.16]Well, shit.
[14:19.28]Goldfinger, thanks for the $15, Goldfinger.
[14:21.34]How much do you bench?
[14:22.40]I used to be able to bench like 180, 200.
[14:26.95]That was like 160 pounds.
[14:28.15]It was pretty damn good.
[14:28.99]I could do like 180 to 200.
[14:32.25]Like three or four times.
[14:33.01]Currently getting my ass kicked.
[14:37.20]But thanks for the $15, Goldfinger.
[14:40.50]I don't even like Taco Bell.
[14:41.48]Gave 250.
[14:41.90]It's okay, I have Adblock.
[14:43.56]What do you want me to say?
[14:50.34]What do you want me to tell you?
[14:53.80]I'm going to lose to Mario?
[14:54.72]Actually, I swept Mario last time I played this.
[15:03.93]At this stage in the game, I think it's time to go for the full house.
[15:07.53]He only has a 13 for a full house.
[15:13.75]Or four of a kind.
[15:15.05]No, that's bad.
[15:18.96]Four of a kind with twos is terrible.
[15:23.42]Go for the straight.
[15:27.24]I need a lot for the straight.
[15:28.36]I already have the twos.
[15:31.52]I need a three and a six.
[15:37.03]I'm dumping the whole thing.
[15:39.69]But thank you.
[15:39.99]I don't even like Taco Bell for the 250.
[15:41.47]Appreciate it.
[15:44.77]one two three four ah come on five okay this is the best two out of three Mario I'm gonna lose I know I am it's over
[16:13.32]Thank you, Sad Vega, for the 250.
[16:17.71]Jerma, I'm thinking of getting a WWE wrestling game.
[16:20.41]I saw 2K18 was on sale.
[16:22.83]Have you used this one to mod make Jerma Rumbles, and how hard is it to set up?
[16:26.19]Let's see.
[16:27.21]Which one is easy to mod?
[16:29.21]There's really no mods that are any real game changers for the WWE games that are on PC.
[16:35.72]They're like costumes and creative characters.
[16:38.38]I'm going to put this on the little straight line.
[16:44.86]Every WWE game after 2K14 is awful.
[16:50.68]They just kind of stopped caring after 2K14.
[16:54.22]Once it came to the new engine and they started to really put it into like the game simulation, not a thing to do for fun.
[17:02.63]Plus, I heard the drama of, isn't Yuke's, didn't they break off?
[17:07.65]Yuke's decided to go make their own wrestling game and 2K still makes, there's going to be another wrestling game made by Yuke's.
[17:17.41]However that plays out, I wonder.
[17:20.21]Because once 2K really got involved and visual concepts started to kind of do some development on the game is when it really kind of took a huge nosedive as a franchise.
[17:32.00]Maybe the one from Yuke's will be more interesting.
[17:34.44]I don't know.
[17:36.38]I keep getting this just shit.
[17:40.22]I need a... Mathematically, I don't think I win.
[17:49.40]I need a 2.
[17:55.67]And there it is.
[17:56.17]Okay, but I don't think I can win.
[17:58.23]I need a Yahtzee to mathematically have a chance.
[18:03.39]But thank you, Sad Vega.
[18:04.25]I would say get 2k14, but it's also very slow and takes a long time to load anything you do with a created character, but it is a much better character creator than the other ones.
[18:14.50]Or wait for Yuke's to come out with their new game coming up, probably in a year or two.
[18:18.22]Maybe, we'll see.
[18:22.59]Deuces.
[18:26.47]Thank you, Drosophilia, for the 250.
[18:27.49]Hey, Jerma, here's a throwback to Recetir.
[18:30.35]Wanted to play the game myself before watching you, and I lost my house twice and reloaded before I finally beat the game on loop one.
[18:41.38]Mario, you're, like, really fucking interrupting me.
[18:44.72]Finally beat the game on loop one.
[18:46.46]Only after I watched you I did I realize that you keep your items in levels and that losing is actually a part of the game.
[18:56.39]Yeah.
[18:59.57]I lost once and then went back and did some tactical video gaming and kept my items and money.
[19:05.98]Well, not my money, my items.
[19:09.94]I'm throwing a Hail Mary here, I think.
[19:14.78]I wonder, should I... I gotta go for a full house.
[19:32.45]There it is.
[19:34.59]I have a mathematical chance it's possible.
[19:37.37]Yeah, that was a great game.
[19:41.28]It was really fun, really interesting.
[19:45.99]$50 from Lakronda.
[19:46.91]Yeah, I remember this one.
[19:48.17]This is the pee-pee-poo-poo comment.
[19:49.53]There was like three pee-pee-poo-poo $50 donations over the last two days.
[19:52.77]That's 50 bucks, guys.
[19:56.09]That's a lot of money.
[19:59.23]Don't get a Yahtzee.
[19:59.85]Don't get a Yahtzee.
[20:00.95]Don't get a Yahtzee.
[20:04.11]Don't get a Yahtzee.
[20:07.61]Thank you, FavoriteSage, for the $5.
[20:11.77]FavoriteSage says, Hey Jerma, you and Vinny are my favorite people on the internet, and I was able to meet Vinny today at the Retro Games Expo.
[20:19.44]That's awesome.
[20:20.90]Was wondering if you'd ever attend any event.
[20:23.64]Mario, stop it!
[20:30.44]I was wondering if you'd be attending any events near New York anytime soon.
[20:37.18]I'm gonna have to say no.
[20:39.62]New York is...
[20:42.55]There's no real conventions, I don't think, or anything I'd be doing in New York.
[20:46.46]I didn't even go back to Boston for PAX East this year.
[20:51.46]So, probably not, unless there was some reason for me to be there, I guess.
[21:01.04]I've kind of been dialing back the amount of conventions I've been going to.
[21:06.00]I think what really... I muted him.
[21:12.82]I think after I went I've been to probably I used to go to like three, four plus conventions every year.
[21:24.06]I okay, I muted him, but it doesn't matter.
[21:26.19]I'm I guess I have to do something else.
[21:27.71]I'm going to mute him here.
[21:29.47]I hard muted him.
[21:32.97]That shouldn't happen anymore.
[21:36.42]But after doing... I did a lot of conventions, three, four, plus five sometimes in a year.
[21:42.72]And it just takes a lot out of me.
[21:44.83]Now more than ever.
[21:47.23]Traveling is just... I kind of would rather just stick around and work on stuff and stream and, you know, kind of just hang out and do my own thing.
[21:56.82]That's not to say that I don't want to go to conventions or that I think conventions aren't worth going to or anything, but...
[22:05.24]I started to really dial it back probably a couple years ago.
[22:12.83]You can still hear him.
[22:20.62]Yeah, you can.
[22:21.60]You can hear it through my headphones.
[22:26.08]But stuff like TwitchCon is close, so I'll probably always just poke my head around there once every year or so, whenever it comes around.
[22:37.40]Other things, probably no more PAXs, I don't think.
[22:42.03]I've been to a lot of them.
[22:44.99]Maybe E3 when it comes around again, especially next year because of the consoles.
[22:52.71]But no, I've been dialing back conventions.
[22:56.57]And then of course, JermaCon coming up in Las Vegas.
[23:03.27]But thank you.
[23:03.81]I appreciate it.
[23:04.31]And thank you for even putting me in the same company as Vinny.
[23:08.77]He's been around for a long time.
[23:11.82]I'm honored to even be put in the same sentence as somebody like that.
[23:17.30]So thank you.
[23:20.64]He's got a great stream.
[23:24.62]Alright, Mario.
[23:25.14]I'm glad to bring you back.
[23:25.92]Are you going to
[23:28.04]You gonna be good, Mario?
[23:28.95]Okay.
[23:34.37]He's quieted down.
[23:37.17]We need sixes.

[25:18.58]Hey, Snooze and Coffin, thanks for the $2.50.
[25:22.94]It's my birthday today.
[25:26.16]Thanks for Terraria and DOS stream.
[25:29.26]DOS is always a blast.
[25:31.38]There's at least one game that's an absolute highlight.
[25:34.40]That does happen.
[25:36.18]DOS is weird.
[25:37.50]Very extreme.
[25:40.24]It's either very, very bad or very, very good.
[25:42.48]I think that's kind of the fun pick-it-out-of-a-hat scenario.
[25:51.30]I do love it, though.
[25:56.04]And then they say, uh, anyway, uh, can I get a happy birthday message shoutout that lasts at least for five minutes?
[26:01.48]Thank you.
[26:03.18]See you next stream.
[26:03.96]Yeah, at least five minutes.
[26:06.44]Snoozycopter, happy birthday.
[26:10.25]Happy birthday.
[26:12.27]We're going for Yahtzee.
[26:14.25]This Yahtzee's for you, Snoozycopter.
[26:15.93]Happy Yahtzee birthday.
[26:23.60]I don't think we're gonna get a Yahtzee birthday.
[26:30.99]We didn't get a Yahtzee birthday.
[26:37.48]Birthday ruined.
[26:38.46]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:40.38]Happy birthday, Snoozycopter, for real.
[26:42.54]Let's do another one.

[26:44.90]You and me.
[26:46.67]But yes, for real, happy birthday.
[26:48.41]Have a good one.
[26:50.47]ChunkyBaloney.
[26:51.49]Thanks to ChunkyBaloney for the five dollars.
[26:52.83]Hey, thanks for playing Museum Madness.
[26:54.19]Brings back memories of when I beat it when I was eight.
[26:56.81]So I'm sure you can finish it.
[26:57.90]I would have finished it, but my computer fucking crashed.
[26:59.82]My internet turned off.
[27:04.78]Fussroboto, thanks for the five dollars.
[27:06.68]Hey, Jerma.
[27:07.48]I'm the pee-pee-poo-poo butthole fart guy from earlier.
[27:09.92]Oh, hey, it's you.
[27:11.09]This dinosaur skeleton has triggered my backseat gamer instincts more than anything else you've ever done.
[27:16.81]Get good.
[27:20.60]Imagine introducing yourself as the pee-pee, poo-poo, butthole, fart guy.
[27:25.92]Nice to meet you.
[27:26.30]Pleased to meet you.
[27:26.78]Yeah.
[27:27.24]What's your name?
[27:27.98]Oh, my name's Jeremy.
[27:29.70]Oh, yeah.
[27:30.10]Hey, pee-pee, poo-poo, butthole, fart guy.
[27:32.98]Just call me Rick.
[27:34.26]Alright.
[27:36.36]Okay.
[27:37.84]Mamma mia.
[27:39.76]Hey, Lizard Boy.
[27:40.60]Thanks for the 10 bucks, Lizard Boy.
[27:46.53]$10 from Lizard Boy.
[27:47.93]Hey, Jerma wanted to give back after all the laughter and joy you've given me over the past eight years.
[27:53.45]It's a long time.
[27:54.19]Since I was a wee 11-year-old lad, I'm now 19 and have been suffering from severe depression over the last three years.
[28:03.06]Sometimes when it feels all like it's going to come crashing down, all it takes is turning on a VOD or a stream.
[28:10.19]If I wake up in time.
[28:11.21]Streams start at 6am in Singapore.
[28:13.95]Time zones are all over the place.
[28:15.06]They really are.
[28:16.32]To make me feel better.
[28:16.90]Thanks for all the great times.
[28:18.40]Here's to more.
[28:20.12]Thank you so much, Lizardboy.
[28:24.02]I really appreciate that.
[28:31.35]Much love to you.
[28:33.25]Across the world.
[28:35.45]If you had told...
[28:38.01]like 16-year-old me, that there was going to be a scenario where I would be able to reach somebody that was that far away and that enjoyed the stuff that I was doing that much.
[28:52.07]I don't think I would have believed you.
[28:58.30]Thank you so much for sticking around.
[28:59.46]I really hope that you get through whatever is going on.
[29:05.82]Almost at the 10-year mark
[29:12.63]Please stick around in this community.
[29:15.27]You're all fucking hilarious.
[29:19.87]Join the Discord if you haven't.
[29:21.31]It's a great place.
[29:26.41]I look forward to saying hello to you at the 10th year.
[29:31.95]Mario, you're gonna get muted again.
[29:34.68]I'm going for the fives.
[29:40.50]But that was Lizard Boy.
[29:41.24]Thank you so much, Lizard Boy.
[29:42.36]For real.
[29:44.64]Four fives.
[29:45.32]Come on, let's see it.
[29:54.69]Do I take the fives or do I take the choice?
[29:56.53]Fives are the choice.
[29:57.37]23 is not bad.
[30:01.23]Three fives is not bad either, but 23 is not bad for choice.
[30:07.73]Alright, I'll take it.
[30:09.41]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $5, Dr. Clay.
[30:12.07]I played that Museum Madness game as a kid.
[30:14.10]There was a lot of puzzles.
[30:15.12]I often had no clue what to do.
[30:17.30]I still had fun, though.
[30:18.60]It was nice seeing it again.
[30:19.32]I appreciate the nostalgia.
[30:20.42]Take care.
[30:23.30]It was an interesting game.
[30:24.06]And that takes us up to the current bits from today.
[30:37.10]Currently in a decent position here.
[30:42.28]With $3 earlier.
[30:43.40]$3 from SirK9.
[30:48.10]They say, I didn't get that mad tonight.
[30:54.59]I got, look, I got visibly frustrated during the ice level.
[30:58.07]Alright.
[31:06.11]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[31:09.73]Why is everyone saying nice?
[31:13.96]Alright, do I do... I could try for a full house.
[31:19.96]Should I go for the full house opportunity?
[31:21.60]That's a decent middle-of-the-road full house.
[31:24.88]Or should I go for a small straight?
[31:30.39]Two, three, four, five...
[31:34.02]Go with the straight?
[31:35.66]Let's go for it.
[31:39.92]There it is.
[31:45.47]Thank you, Bakken, for the $2.50.
[31:47.51]Watch that $1.80.
[31:48.57]Watch that $1.80.
[31:51.37]It'll creep up on you.
[31:53.39]Thank you, Bakken.
[31:53.97]Appreciate the $2.50.
[31:58.90]We also had Demonic Cucumber gave $2.50. $2.50.
[32:03.39]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[32:04.25]I find it weird that you've banned diaper... dia space per jokes in your chat.
[32:09.57]Seeing as you had one in your old demo reel.
[32:13.09]By the way, I'm not a stalker.
[32:14.37]This is in chat.
[32:15.53]I know people... that's... whatever.
[32:16.67]I don't care.
[32:19.14]Don't forget the bits from yesterday.
[32:20.36]I already did.
[32:20.80]No, it's not that I'm banning diaper jokes.
[32:24.72]I'm not banning diaper... Mario, we're almost at that last straw where you get muted permanently.
[32:32.85]I mean, like, on the, like, the audio of the stream.
[32:37.80]Audio of the stream, I'm gonna make that very clear.
[32:42.36]Mama mia.
[32:44.94]Anyways.
[32:48.56]Mama mia, yeah, I know.
[32:51.30]Um, it wasn't the fact that they were- It's gonna happen.
[32:55.51]Alright, I'm rolling!
[32:57.45]It wasn't the fact that diaper jokes were in the chat, it was 50% of all chat was diaper-related.
[33:04.04]for two straight hours I couldn't even read we were talking about Terraria and in between stuff of talking about Terraria was like diaper spam whose fault is it it's my fault but that means I have to correct it oh you're so good it's my turn now
[33:34.67]But thank you, DemonicCucumber, for the $2.50.
[33:36.99]Uh, this person has smashed... It's a smashed keyboard name.
[33:39.67]It's... It's just a smashed keyboard.
[33:43.80]Uh, thanks for the $10.
[33:44.28]Hey, Jerma, are you gonna play Electronic Super Joy 2?
[33:48.66]It just released today, and it's free on Steam.
[33:57.30]I... I made a video on Electronic Super Joy.
[34:00.40]Like, seven years ago.
[34:09.40]That is the right game, right?
[34:12.14]Electronic Super Joy.
[34:12.84]I did.
[34:14.21]Somebody find it.
[34:14.91]It's there somewhere from like 2012 or something.
[34:20.23]I might give it a try.
[34:24.27]I forgot about that video too until you just said Electronic Super Joy 2.
[34:31.67]It's time for slime.
[34:32.41]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[34:34.42]Uh, the Dermados video I made seemed well-received.
[34:36.76]I made a second one.
[34:37.74]Thought you and chat would enjoy it.
[34:40.04]Well, we're gonna wait till the end of the stream for this one.
[34:45.70]Absolutely gonna watch this.
[34:46.60]Thank you.
[34:46.88]It's time for sign for 10 bucks, and I can't wait to watch this video.
[34:51.38]Thank you.
[34:53.56]What do I want to do here?
[34:55.80]Let's go with twos, I think.
[34:57.60]Yeah, or one, two.
[35:00.26]I could do one, two, three.
[35:01.92]No, just the twos.
[35:06.37]twos let's get some twos hey look at that that's pretty good we might be able to get a yahtzee hmm
[35:47.95]Don't get a Yahtzee.
[35:54.21]I could feel collectively all of you sink down in your seat and like your neck stuffs into you and just like I could feel it.
[36:04.74]There's like thousands of you that did that.
[36:08.28]I can't even see how many people are here right now.
[36:10.64]But I can feel it.
[36:19.48]At least half of you guys just turtled down into your shoulders.
[36:24.92]You keep digging yourself bigger and bigger hole with that joke.
[36:27.38]I know, but... It's fucking like midnight Pacific.
[36:32.06]You know, what's the big deal?
[36:33.66]It's fine.
[36:40.85]Nobody's gonna see that shit anyways.
[36:42.43]You guys are like the late-night crew.
[36:48.39]That's a potential for a big straight.
[36:54.07]Uh, thank you spliceable spleen for the five dollars.
[36:58.57]Jerma, I know you're suffering quite a lot right now, but honestly, the streams where you are borderline meltdown or full-on meltdown are my favorite.
[37:04.21]Please continue to get angry.
[37:12.47]This is not a big straight.
[37:14.21]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[37:15.61]Okay.
[37:18.75]Let's go 5.
[37:19.09]What do you think- What's more- What's possible?
[37:22.83]A 5?
[37:24.47]Or a 5?
[37:24.85]I just need a 5.
[37:26.22]Doesn't matter.
[37:27.74]It's just a 5, no matter what.
[37:28.92]Okay.
[37:29.34]Whatever.
[37:29.68]I'm an idiot.
[37:30.10]1, 2, 3, 4- 2, 3, 4, 5- It's a 5 every time.
[37:34.20]Just go.
[37:34.68]Shit.
[37:35.04]Come on.
[37:57.25]Fuck.
[37:58.49]Uh... Yeah, but I don't like to go too far.
[38:03.35]I'm getting upset and stuff.
[38:06.75]Doesn't happen that often.
[38:08.89]And, of course, he, like, he fucking top decks a big straight.
[38:12.64]Then he needs to roll.
[38:13.80]Thanks, Mario.
[38:17.36]Uh, Cyrus Dexter, thanks for the five dollars.
[38:19.38]No message, just five bucks.
[38:20.26]Thank you, Cyrus.
[38:22.70]Thank you, Espada Escarlata, for the two fifty.
[38:26.40]Here's some bits.
[38:26.90]Hope you feel better after beating or giving up on this game.
[38:29.18]Whichever happens.
[38:30.00]I beat it.
[38:31.46]But I do appreciate the fact that it was either way.
[38:34.20]Thank you.
[38:38.20]Alright, what am I going to do?
[38:39.20]Big straight again.
[38:39.86]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[38:40.41]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[38:40.51]4.
[38:40.71]Please.
[38:41.23]This is so... I need this.
[39:11.22]Mario, whatever.
[39:14.58]Thank you to Mr. Rad HD for the four dollars.
[39:17.80]I love Jerma.
[39:18.58]He's a cute boy with a nice man face.
[39:21.77]Wow, good boy.
[39:25.29]Thank you.
[39:27.49]He already has sixes, right?
[39:28.45]No, he doesn't.
[39:28.87]Shit.
[39:31.58]Thank you, Mr. RadHD.
[39:33.62]Four of a kind.
[39:38.27]Bala Koala, thanks for the five dollars.
[39:40.61]Hey, Jerma, just want to say thanks for all the laughs and smiles.
[39:42.45]Your streams always seem to be able to brighten up my stressful day.
[39:47.39]My pleasure.
[39:47.84]Thank you for the five bucks, and thanks for hanging out.
[39:53.12]Without you, there is no stream.
[39:55.58]Collectively, all of you.
[39:57.76]Thank you.
[40:02.96]How do I have a Yahtzee and still gonna lose this damn game?
[40:14.07]Do I just hold the 6 and just throw it all away?
[40:31.52]One, two, three, four.
[40:32.64]One, two, two, three, four, five.
[40:39.98]Now what the fuck do I do?
[40:42.18]I keep getting this shit.
[40:43.74]Over and over again.
[40:46.14]You want a two, a three, and a four, and a five?
[40:47.41]You want a five, a two, and a three, and a four?
[40:48.61]You want a four?
[40:49.53]You want, uh... There's, uh... Hair on the flea, on the frog, on the log, on the bog, on the dog, on the dog, on the seat.
[41:02.01]Here it comes.
[41:05.97]Oh, yeah!
[41:08.69]Okay.
[41:09.55]We had, uh, that was Balakuala.
[41:18.94]Thank you, Balakuala.
[41:20.76]Halo Softboy, thanks for the 250.
[41:22.70]Jeremy, you're a great guy.
[41:23.88]You're great, too.
[41:26.04]You're breathtaking.
[41:27.92]No, thank you, for real.
[41:29.52]Thank you, Halo Softboy.
[41:32.68]Uh, Colusia.
[41:36.17]Colusia, thanks for the 250.
[41:39.07]This stream is amazing.
[41:39.95]Oh my god, my stomach still hurts from laughing.
[41:42.41]Thanks for always brightening my day and being my favorite content creator.
[41:45.85]You've done so much for my mental health lately.
[41:48.25]Love you, Chairman.
[41:48.79]Thank you.
[41:51.82]It's always great when a game and a stream just kind of click together and it's one of those...
[41:58.84]I was laughing my ass off.
[42:00.62]At least for the first, like, four and a half straight hours of this stream.
[42:04.72]And it doesn't happen every single time, right?
[42:06.80]You obviously know everything's the funniest fucking thing you've ever seen in your life, right?
[42:10.17]But when stuff just kind of clicks together, it's just... I love it.
[42:13.43]It was a great time.
[42:25.80]This is important.
[42:27.94]I need this will help.
[42:33.94]And there it is.
[42:38.29]Just need a big straight, and I pretty much win the game, no matter what.
[42:41.35]I have to get the straight, though.
[42:48.59]Balla Koala gave $50 and had something very important to say.
[42:54.04]Again, this is another $50 pee-pee-poo-poo comment.
[42:58.96]That's going on the fours line.
[43:01.96]pee-pee, poo-poo.
[43:07.98]$50.
[43:14.45]I could buy a PlayStation 4 Pro with the amount of pee-pee, poo-poo, $50 comments that came through over the last two days.
[43:25.05]Mario, I know.
[43:29.87]I just want to make sure that you guys are aware of that.
[43:33.67]You know, you could have given me $5.
[43:34.59]Or a dollar.
[43:36.85]You could have just gave for like $2.50 and said poo-poo pee-poo.
[43:40.60]Whatever the fucking thing is.
[43:41.50]That's a lot of money for pee-pee poo-poo.
[43:50.45]And I've said it.
[43:51.21]Maybe this is the point.
[43:52.39]I've said it like fucking 12 times.
[43:55.45]That's a telephone call.
[44:02.78]I'm gonna answer that and it's gonna be pee-pee-poo-poo.
[44:08.69]I need, uh, I'm gonna go four of a kind.
[44:10.45]Let's go.
[44:11.25]Let's do it.
[44:11.71]Four of a kind.
[44:12.39]Sixes.
[44:18.28]One tooth.
[44:19.06]No!
[44:19.52]No!
[44:27.32]Shit.
[44:28.82]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, mistake.
[44:31.10]It was a mistake, it was a mistake, it was a mistake.
[44:32.62]I'm doing force.
[44:33.14]Okay.
[44:36.92]I got it.
[44:56.77]Don't.
[44:59.39]That's fine.
[44:59.81]I'll take it.
[45:04.31]Come on, Mario.
[45:06.78]Let me get this win.
[45:07.76]I need to get this win.
[45:08.64]We're almost at the end of the bits.
[45:12.54]Deuces.
[45:15.60]I need a four.
[45:16.48]Look, a good four of a kind and a straight ends this.
[45:23.50]Six, five, six, five, four, three,
[45:30.57]I need the two.
[45:34.72]Give me the two.
[45:36.68]Give me the two.
[45:38.42]Give me the two.
[45:40.26]Do it.
[45:54.99]Mavericks!
[45:55.53]Thank you, Mavericks, for the $5.
[45:56.61]Not sure where I get these bits, but here's to you, man.
[45:58.71]Love your content.
[45:59.33]Keep being awesome.
[46:00.11]Thank you.
[46:02.61]Thank you so much.
[46:04.95]We had $10 from NotSoCripplingDepression for $10.
[46:07.55]Hey, just wanted to let you know, you can build a sword that lets you go extremely fast into an area called Snow White.
[46:15.46]You should also have all the needed materials, really.
[46:19.64]What'd he do?
[46:23.13]Oh, no, he just don't get a Yahtzee and I win.
[46:25.47]That's fine.
[46:30.19]He's not paying attention to me.
[46:31.93]He had four sixes.
[46:33.03]I wasn't even looking.
[46:35.77]Speaking of sixes, we're just going for it.
[46:38.49]I just gotta get some points.
[46:40.05]It doesn't matter.
[46:40.49]Mathematically, if I get a... I win.
[46:43.79]I don't care.
[46:44.59]Well, okay, that's... Should I just take it?
[46:48.36]I'm just gonna take it.
[46:48.92]No, that's awful.
[46:49.74]None of this matters.
[46:51.08]It doesn't matter.
[46:58.10]Whatever, fine.
[47:02.50]Yahtzee loses anyways.
[47:04.02]I lose anyways.
[47:08.29]I have a fast item in Terraria, but I'm kind of just following Star's lead.
[47:17.15]Thank you.
[47:17.49]Back in for the 250.
[47:18.09]Uh-oh.
[47:29.76]That was a little scary, but it's okay.
[47:33.13]I win.
[47:33.99]Mario, you lose.
[47:34.59]Game over.
[47:38.25]But back and thanks for the $2.50.
[47:39.25]I never expected you playing Terraria.
[47:41.35]And honestly, seeing you play this game, the game made this year a little better than it is.
[47:44.94]I can't say things are getting better, and honestly, I don't know if it really will.
[47:47.90]But then again, you'd never know.
[47:50.16]You really do never know.
[47:55.18]Life is Strange.
[47:56.66]Life is funny.
[47:57.30]It has a way of unexpectedly changing.
[48:03.60]Keep your head up.
[48:08.74]But I wish Shadow a lovely good night and wish you the best on that carnival stream.
[48:13.08]I'm sure you're going to put in a lot of work.
[48:14.83]Much love and looking forward to far more.
[48:21.49]Yeah, I can't wait for that stream.
[48:23.89]That stream's going to be so much fun.
[48:27.97]Thank you so much, Bakken.
[48:29.79]Have a great night.
[48:30.31]197 points.
[48:35.44]And that actually perfectly brings us... To... We're gonna watch this video.
[48:43.85]No, Mario.
[48:44.45]You lose.
[48:51.98]Let's watch this video.
[48:53.10]Let's do... Oh, we got two more bits here.
[48:54.64]We got DCPro1 for $5.
[48:56.74]Hey, Jeremy Cakes.
[48:58.32]The past few weeks have sucked.
[49:00.50]I changed majors from aerospace engineering to new media and film production.
[49:05.33]My family is so angry.
[49:07.35]Any advice on how to stay motivated?
[49:08.77]I really love making films and stuff, but they kind of make me scared for this career.
[49:15.09]Well, here's the thing.
[49:17.78]You... You know what you want to do.
[49:23.16]And regardless of what somebody else wants to have you do or something that they decide, this is what's best for you.
[49:31.21]You know yourself the best.
[49:35.61]The advice that I would give, I give it sometimes is just always make sure you have a few things that you're interested in.
[49:43.19]So no matter what happens, let's say you have like three or four things that you really think are interesting and you put some work into them, you're going to be happy doing any of those things.
[49:55.28]Don't put all your eggs in one basket, spread it out a little bit and try to be happy doing with, you know, the thing that you're good at doing.
[50:04.29]Try to be good at a few things.
[50:05.59]Try to care about a few things.
[50:07.89]You won't be disappointed.
[50:12.17]Suchy P with $50.
[50:14.07]Should I read this out loud?
[50:25.87]Thank you for the $50, Suchy P. It's pee-pee-poo-poo.
[50:31.47]Again.
[50:31.71]Yeah.
[50:37.97]Somebody just said it right there.
[50:39.29]Just do your thing.
[50:40.59]Do you.
[50:43.31]Don't let somebody tell you how to do you because they don't know.
[50:47.53]You know.
[50:50.83]I wish you the best of luck, though.
[50:54.58]And then Pink Lawyer, 10 bucks.
[50:55.82]Thanks for streaming, Jeremy.
[50:57.60]I don't know if you've seen the animated video of you telling a sad story, but it always makes my day.
[51:01.36]Yeah, we watched it.
[51:02.48]We did watch it yesterday.
[51:04.28]Yesterday or the day before?
[51:05.38]It was very funny, though.
[51:07.14]And Rektar, $5.00.
[51:08.40]Pee-pee, poo-poo, wee-wee, wee-wee.
[51:10.96]Okay.
[51:11.63]Thank you.
[51:13.91]Very cool.
[51:14.87]Very cool stuff.
[51:18.59]There's another $50.00.
[51:19.19]I'm going to have to ban that word.
[51:23.19]That's another 5,000 bits Bala Koala poo-poo pee-pee.
[51:26.71]Alright.
[51:27.29]Why are you doing this?
[51:35.29]That's too much money for Poo Poo Pee Pee.
[51:40.83]That was Balla Koala.
[51:42.01]Five fucking thousand bits.
[51:44.45]Where's the link to that video?
[51:45.94]To It's Time for Slimes video?
[51:48.34]Let's check it out before I go.
[51:50.06]And I will see you guys on Thursday.
[51:51.12]I'm gonna be gone for a few days.
[51:57.19]What are you guys doing?
[51:59.89]I can't even... It's not even on the screen.
[52:04.45]That was...
[52:06.19]That was a hundred dollars.
[52:08.89]A hundred dollars.
[52:10.00]Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[52:10.82]Suchy P. Thank you for the fucking 10,000 bits.
[52:16.92]No, don't get on this.
[52:18.24]You guys don't get on.
[52:19.06]Don't get on like pee-pee-poo-poo.
[52:21.76]How?
[52:22.22]I'm never going to be able to... Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[52:31.53]What?
[52:31.87]I don't even know.
[52:32.43]What even is that?
[52:34.59]What is pee-pee-poo-poo?
[52:36.39]I don't even... It's just a gross-out humor.
[52:40.93]Sushi-pee, $100.
[52:42.01]Pee-pee-poo-poo, motherfucker.
[52:47.62]Alright, I'm gonna... That's, like, hundreds of dollars from Sushi-pee.
[52:53.20]Sushi-pee.
[52:54.02]Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[52:54.86]Again.
[52:56.26]Poo-poo-pee-pee.
[52:57.74]I need to stop saying this before I make this a thing.
[53:04.25]Thank you so much for the huge amount of money.
[53:08.15]Rektar, $5.
[53:09.19]They say the line.
[53:14.67]DC Pro, $5.
[53:15.84]They're saying the line.
[53:26.52]Why is this not working?
[53:30.01]Dermados 2 coming up.
[53:33.54]Sue GP, $50.
[53:35.40]I hope it's not pee-pee-poo-poo.
[53:37.91]It's not.
[53:39.41]Okay, but seriously, you're one of my favorite streamers.
[53:41.19]Thanks for streaming.
[53:41.83]You rock.
[53:42.25]Thank you for the ridiculous amount of money.
[53:48.57]I'll try to put it to good use.
[53:49.57]Thank you so much.
[53:50.27]I really appreciate it.
[53:52.03]That was Sue GP with fucking a trillion dollars.
[54:00.74]Thank you so much.
[54:03.11]Let's watch Jerma DOS 2.
[54:06.41]Here we go.
[54:15.76]I got to get this in the right spot.
[54:19.30]Let's go.
[54:37.29]I thought that was money.
[55:11.23]What the fuck?
[55:14.98]That's not what that looked like, was it?
[55:19.10]Look at how much fun this slide is.
[55:44.93]That's somebody's asshole.
[55:50.35]These are so good, man.
[55:51.58]Like, seriously, these are fucking awesome.
[55:59.52]Thank you for that.
[56:00.14]That was great.
[56:03.16]And, hey, look at this!
[56:06.89]The stream over for the first time today.
[56:12.64]Thank you, Watfridge, for the $5.
[56:15.52]Not a pee-pee-poo-poo joke.
[56:16.78]Well, it was.
[56:17.30]Uh, Creamy Sensation, $5.
[56:20.20]Oop, oop, eep, eep.
[56:21.54]Jervis Snort.
[56:22.56]That's right, it was in reverse.
[56:23.84]You got it.
[56:26.19]Uh, SadVega250, it can all be explained.
[56:28.21]Uh, check out this, uh, video of Yoda.
[56:30.99]Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[56:36.39]He doesn't say that in Star Wars.
[56:38.61]I'm 100%.
[56:38.75]100% positive.
[56:44.81]Thank you.
[56:47.33]Thank you, Dino Squad, for the 250.
[56:48.92]Jerma, I really want to tell you that I love everything you've been doing for the past five or six years.
[56:52.90]This is another 100.
[56:54.62]Oh my goodness, guys.
[56:57.82]But, Dino Squad, thanks for the 250.
[57:02.94]Love everything you've been doing for the last five or six years.
[57:04.84]I've been following you for a hot minute.
[57:06.60]Just want to say that you've been helping me with not stay as stressed as I should be.
[57:10.98]Me and my fiance just had our first child about a month ago.
[57:14.22]And our son has gotten so used to hearing your voice that he's almost gotten to the point to where he can't fall asleep without hearing you.
[57:21.67]Love you.
[57:21.95]Keep up the great work.
[57:23.61]Congratulations on your first child.
[57:26.19]That's a huge, huge deal.
[57:30.23]And I'll be a good night light.
[57:34.29]Except I say, like, fuck all the time.
[57:36.89]Don't leave me on past, like, 11 months.
[57:41.16]Otherwise, I say, like, fucking shit and, like, pee-pee-poo-poo all the time.
[57:51.10]Gotta be careful there.
[57:53.50]But thank you so much for the $2.50.
[57:56.60]And congratulations again.
[57:58.97]Then we had Zelgroat with $100.
[58:00.63]I've been watching you since the TF2 days and you helped me through the darkest times and you're the funniest boomer I know.
[58:06.75]I want to thank you for the years of laughs from Australia.
[58:11.00]Thank you so much for the fucking hundred bucks.
[58:15.12]Stick around.
[58:17.10]I got more to show you.
[58:19.78]Thank you so much.
[58:22.56]It's my pleasure.
[58:24.74]Genpendulum.
[58:25.56]Genpendulum, thanks for the $5.
[58:26.38]They just say P.
[58:29.14]I don't even know who gave those 20 subs.
[58:30.60]It was anonymous.
[58:31.02]Somebody just gave a shitload of subs.
[58:58.23]Thank you, whoever you were, for the gigantic sub drop.
[59:04.43]Thank you, Anonymous.
[59:08.87]It must have been pee-pee-poo-poo.
[59:14.86]That's a lot of subs, whoever you are.
[59:16.40]Thank you.
[59:21.52]Have a fantastic rest of your morning for some of you, evening for some of you others.
[59:27.32]I'll see you Thursday.
[59:29.31]Get some sleep.
[59:31.95]Much love to y'all.
[59:34.81]Take care.
[59:37.33]See you real soon.
[60:01.18]Oh, I didn't even do the credits!
[60:02.56]Holy shit, what am I talking about?
[60:07.44]I'm, like, fucking tired, apparently.
[60:08.99]It's so much, like, money just came in.
[60:10.57]I didn't even do the credits!
[60:13.37]Get him up there!
[60:20.04]You guys spoil the shit out of me.
[60:22.80]Thank you, everybody.
[60:26.49]One more bit message came in.
[60:27.37]They said it was from forrealdoe250.
[60:28.67]Don't know if you've seen this video, but in case you haven't, the video's not mine.
[60:32.49]It's the sad story.
[60:34.27]We have seen it.
[60:35.77]It was fucking hilarious.
[60:37.57]But thank you for bringing it to my attention anyways.
[60:40.49]And thank you, everybody, all the community subs, all the gifted subs.
[60:46.04]Community subs.
[60:48.34]You are a sub.
[60:49.66]Community.
[60:50.54]You're... Yeah.
[60:55.72]If you're a sub, you're a part of the sub of a community of subs.
[61:02.72]But for real, a shitload of money comes through this channel.
[61:06.58]I really hope you still like it.
[61:07.50]I still hope you're having a good time.
[61:09.38]I'm still having a good fucking time.
[61:13.60]Stick around.
[61:20.50]We got rats?
[61:22.24]Look at those two rats!
[61:23.96]They're beautiful.
[61:32.57]Look at all these names, and people are still just subscribing at the end here.
[61:35.71]Am I gonna play Classic WoW?
[61:37.99]Yeah.
[61:39.91]We'll do a thing, where, uh, for at least four.
[61:46.70]I don't want to, like, the thing of, doesn't Classic WoW only have, like, five or six servers?
[61:56.62]I saw that recently.
[61:57.44]They posted, oh yeah, there's like eight servers.
[61:59.39]We're gonna... I don't want to just ruin one.
[62:02.83]13 servers for NA.
[62:03.41]That doesn't seem like very much.
[62:05.05]There's only two PST servers.
[62:14.87]Maybe.
[62:16.51]I gotta be careful.
[62:17.31]I don't want to be... I'll be careful with this.
[62:20.87]Because if there's really only going to be two servers on the West Coast...
[62:25.62]At least initially, I don't... Hey, let's like dump thousands of people in a server and... Camp Orgrimmar.
[62:34.24]I do want to do something like that, though.
[62:35.62]I figured it'd be fun.
[62:38.68]But I don't want to be... People want to play and have fun and... I don't want to get in the way of somebody else's fun to just kind of be like... A dick or something.
[62:47.75]And flood a server.
[62:49.63]We'll see, though.
[62:58.56]Horde is better than Alliance.
[63:01.47]Well, that's your opinion.
[63:05.31]I have played both sides.
[63:11.47]I started my first account as Horde.
[63:14.76]I think the first character I ever made was a troll.
[63:21.42]And the character I played the most time on was a dwarf.
[63:26.01]Get the jokes out now.
[63:30.67]But thank you, everybody.
[63:36.04]I'm glad we got to do at least eight plus hours the last two days.
[63:40.08]I want to do some chunky ones because I knew I wasn't going to be around for the next few days.
[63:43.54]So good night.
[63:46.22]Get some sleep.
[63:47.72]Much love to all of you.
[63:49.66]I'll see you real soon.
[63:51.50]Ta-ta.
[64:18.25]Thank you.
