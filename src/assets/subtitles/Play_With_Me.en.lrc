[00:24.67]Alright, you guys know the drill.
[00:27.71]You guys know the drill.
[00:28.74]I'm gonna get over here and I'm gonna sit down.
[00:34.42]You know the drill.
[00:39.68]Hey guys, what's up?
[00:40.70]Welcome to the stream.
[00:44.08]How are you today?
[00:45.90]Hope you're having a good one.
[00:48.84]I'm okay.
[00:50.20]I'm having a good day.
[00:55.17]Want to eat some bugs?
[00:59.69]Yeah, I didn't stream last night because I haven't been feeling well.
[01:04.68]My stomach, intestines... Dot, dot, dot.
[01:08.50]You know, the rest of the story.
[01:11.16]You know the rest of the story.
[01:12.38]I don't need to tell you it.
[01:13.18]Because I've told it before, but... I'm going to try to go over it as long as I can today.
[01:17.80]Um...
[01:21.57]But yeah, I'm just gonna relax.
[01:23.29]I'm gonna chill and play a relaxing horror game.
[01:27.29]That's what you do when you like don't really feel well and you sit down and you play like a Saw game.
[01:36.81]Just get this put up here.
[01:40.56]This is an EU friendly stream because I thought I was gonna be going like all day today because I thought I was gonna feel better.
[01:47.80]That didn't quite happen.
[01:49.49]So, we'll see how long we can go before I shit my pants on camera and get banned for life.
[02:00.62]This is not the Saw game.
[02:03.04]I want to play the old Saw games.
[02:04.74]This game just came out on Steam.
[02:07.44]This could be...
[02:09.86]One of two things are going to happen here.
[02:10.98]This is going to be either we're out of here immediately.
[02:14.68]Oh, no, you're not.
[02:16.04]We can't stop playing a game in the first hour.
[02:18.97]This game uses your microphone.
[02:21.91]And you've got to use your hands.
[02:23.25]You've got to talk to the game or something.
[02:25.37]We'll see.
[02:29.96]It's not even on... It's not even on Twitch.
[02:33.28]I had to put a fake name there.
[02:36.24]And thank you, UltraZoop, for the 15 bucks.
[02:37.96]Appreciate that.
[02:38.97]And BLB24, thanks for the $1.
[02:42.41]First donation.

[02:46.05]Hey, thank you.
[02:46.69]Thanks, BLB.
[02:47.97]Welcome.
[02:48.91]Thank you for your first ever donation.
[02:49.99]Appreciate it.
[02:54.08]This is just a puzzle game.
[02:56.10]I'm just gonna relax.
[02:58.85]We're just gonna chill.
[03:00.13]I got like tons of things that I've ordered that we're gonna do over here in the next few weeks.
[03:04.13]Just let me just relax and play with me.
[03:06.57]You know what I mean?
[03:07.65]Let me just relax here.
[03:09.35]Just let me play with myself.
[03:11.46]You know what I'm saying?
[03:16.68]Just let me play with myself.
[03:18.30]See what I'm saying here?
[03:19.08]Let's get this here.
[03:22.84]Alright.
[03:26.06]This is called play with me.
[03:29.66]Like me playing with me, you understand?
[03:36.23]Thank you, StixRenegade, for the $1.
[03:37.69]I literally just woke up 10 minutes ago.
[03:41.03]Well, good morning.
[03:43.05]And also thank you, SmittenSame, for the $1.
[03:44.90]Early streamer, cheers to that.
[03:48.16]So, I think we're ready.
[03:49.32]I got it set up before we get- but- but we're- we're just gonna chill so people can trickle in because this is early.
[03:55.26]People aren't expecting this.
[03:57.28]And no, don't freak out.
[03:58.62]I've been freaking out every time I look over here.
[04:00.75]I really do think there are bugs on my screen.
[04:03.93]While setting this stream up, my peripheral picked up these bugs.
[04:09.55]It's the middle of winter.
[04:10.27]We just had a huge snowstorm.
[04:12.27]They're not real.
[04:13.70]Let's- see?
[04:15.04]That wasn't real.
[04:16.28]Don't worry.
[04:22.82]No, this is not a webcam game either, by the way.
[04:28.30]Alright, are we ready?
[04:31.93]We're just relaxing right today.
[04:37.19]Had a big bug.
[04:38.01]Yeah, there's bugs on my screen.
[04:41.17]I think we're ready to go.
[04:43.31]Thank you to Troll Eater and LaFurl for the $1 each.
[04:45.93]What is this?
[04:46.79]Oh, no, we don't.
[04:48.78]Do I prefer Jar Jar over Rose from The Last Jedi?
[04:54.94]I... You know, I hope they marry.
[05:00.19]And in Star Wars episode 15, I hope there's a Jar Jar Rose baby.
[05:08.57]Then what are we going to do?
[05:11.83]Huh?
[05:12.35]Thank you, Bia345 for the $1.
[05:13.45]Hope you're stocked up on bread and milk, fam.
[05:16.11]Good luck.
[05:16.49]Have fun.
[05:19.72]And never trust purple links with five bucks.
[05:21.11]Play with myself.
[05:21.73]German, why do you do this to us?
[05:22.87]I'm not doing anything.
[05:23.83]Let's go.
[05:24.23]Look, the game records your voice.
[05:26.33]It's one of those games.
[05:28.31]New game.
[05:29.37]Are you ready to start playing with myself?
[05:34.85]To start the game, select the available game mode.
[05:36.49]We got... Get that fucking bug.
[05:38.10]Squash that bug!
[05:39.70]Normal.
[05:40.38]I'm gonna do Torture of Mind.
[05:43.46]Select a difficulty.
[05:44.30]Easy.
[05:44.52]Contains hints for riddles.
[05:46.80]You guys are gonna have to help me here.
[05:47.68]We're gonna have to do this together.
[05:50.85]This is not like a first person shooter.
[05:54.14]Look, I told you guys, we're just relaxing today.
[05:57.78]Everybody relax.
[05:59.18]This is not gonna be like a bunch of funny shit.
[06:01.31]This is not gonna be like, I can't run somebody over with a car in this stream.
[06:04.29]You know what I'm saying?
[06:05.73]Normal.
[06:08.47]I'm not gonna torture of mind.
[06:11.23]On December 12th, December 1999, investigative journalist Robert Huck and his wife went out to celebrate his birthday.
[06:22.60]On their way back home, something happened.
[06:27.52]It has changed their lives.
[06:29.16]Is that me?
[06:30.58]I just got dragged out of a car.
[06:35.77]This game might not even be in 3D.
[06:39.19]Robert woke up in a dark room.
[06:42.25]The only sign telling him he was still alive was a terrible headache.
[06:48.61]Okay.
[06:49.61]This might be a Flash game.
[06:51.59]It's possible.
[06:56.69]Here we go.
[07:02.29]Just because you can't see something, it doesn't mean... Will this guy stop talking?
[07:08.26]What did I just do?
[07:10.16]See?
[07:10.46]It's a... It might be a flash game, but... No, see?
[07:13.80]3D!
[07:14.56]My hands are in three dimensions.
[07:16.06]I'm telling you, this is gonna be a fun game.
[07:21.75]You guys just wait.
[07:26.59]Play with me.
[07:27.83]See?
[07:28.41]Just wait.
[07:28.73]Alright, music by Kevin MacLeod.
[07:34.23]There he is!
[07:34.72]This Kevin MacLeod.
[07:39.28]The royalty-free music guy that you can just go to Incompetech and get it.
[07:44.62]Alright, let me free myself.
[07:47.38]The game is listening to me right now, you understand?
[07:51.89]The game had to take control of my microphone.
[07:54.53]Okay, I need to use my keyboard to enter the code.
[08:03.77]That is a long code.
[08:05.15]How am I gonna get this code?
[08:06.29]That is so long for the first portion of the game.
[08:11.34]Okay, here we go.
[08:14.22]I'm ready.
[08:15.90]It's like a 12-digit hash.
[08:20.06]Hold on, wait.
[08:20.64]To enter the code?
[08:21.26]No, no.
[08:21.58]We're not going to do that.
[08:23.46]How about you killed her?
[08:28.43]Okay, you can only look at something from far away.
[08:33.47]We've got a couple of chains here.
[08:36.57]We're looking for a code.
[08:37.43]Can I see the newspaper?
[08:39.54]I can't scroll?
[08:40.26]There's gotta be like a code written on the wall.
[08:41.82]What about over here?
[08:46.56]Okay, just because you can't see something.
[08:52.47]Is it on my hands?
[08:55.37]Is it just somebody's phone number?
[08:59.95]The game's too quiet?
[09:01.53]I'll fix that.
[09:03.65]Don't worry, I'll fix that.
[09:12.74]I'll fix that.
[09:13.80]How did that... Why did that lower... That lowered the volume.
[09:17.46]Subtitles.
[09:17.88]Let's turn the subtitles on, too.
[09:19.08]Polish.
[09:20.12]Okay, no.
[09:21.50]Oh my god, somebody gave $100.
[09:22.20]Is that good?
[09:25.24]Better?
[09:25.48]How's that?
[09:30.53]I think it has made it worse.
[09:33.65]I'm not gonna... Wait, it says I have a headache.
[09:37.23]Is my headache eventually going to kill me?
[09:39.57]It might.
[09:42.80]Thank you, Ben.
[09:43.54]Welcome back, Ben.
[09:44.36]Ben Elno for the $100.
[09:45.84]Hey there.
[09:46.26]Hi there.
[09:47.70]Hold there.
[09:49.20]Thank you so much, Ben, for the $100.
[09:50.72]Ben, otherwise known as... Alright!
[09:52.44]I can look at the poster.
[09:53.78]Just hold on a minute, guys.
[09:55.36]We're going to figure this out.
[09:58.22]This is a puzzle game.
[09:58.90]I just heard something up here.
[10:14.79]Hold on.
[10:15.23]I... How did I, like, drop the volume of the game?
[10:20.29]Can I, like, move my mouse over here?
[10:24.91]Let me just... Hold on.
[10:26.86]There we go.
[10:28.04]Now you guys can hear.
[10:31.74]How does that sound?
[10:34.68]Hey, that's way too... Now we can go into here.
[10:37.38]Don't worry, I got you guys covered.
[10:39.64]Now we drop this.
[10:43.04]But, like...
[10:45.24]What, it's 50?
[10:48.18]40?
[10:49.56]Like that?
[10:50.00]How's that?
[10:50.42]That sounds good.
[10:51.46]Drop this.
[10:53.34]I think we're good.
[10:56.38]Okay.
[10:59.25]I need the code.
[11:01.55]Are there any other buttons?
[11:06.29]Oh, then you can do anything.
[11:07.45]Oh god, hold on.
[11:15.92]Can I look at my back?
[11:17.00]Wait, I have a backpack.
[11:17.72]God damn it.
[11:18.36]I'm gonna die in here.
[11:19.50]I'm gonna die in here.
[11:20.48]Inscription.
[11:20.98]You killed her?
[11:21.62]Hold on, wait a minute.
[11:24.67]You killed her.
[11:25.27]Oh, fuck.
[11:26.79]It's not you killed her.
[11:46.19]Oh, now my headache levels are increasing.
[11:52.16]Uh... I feel like it's on my hands.
[11:55.08]I'm just gonna die in here.
[11:56.80]I can't get by the first part.
[11:58.56]We didn't even get to the part where the game listens to me in the microphone.
[12:02.59]I killed her?
[12:03.53]Incorrect code.
[12:12.03]It's not I killed her.
[12:14.25]I didn't even kill anybody.
[12:15.49]That's the- alright.
[12:16.37]Can I please just get out?
[12:17.56]I need to focus.
[12:19.62]How many fingers do I have?
[12:20.66]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[12:21.40]10 fingers!
[12:32.28]Headache headache It's not headache code click the darkness just because you can't see something it doesn't mean it doesn't exist Yeah, what's at this inscription?
[12:47.51]Note.
[12:50.31]Switch.
[12:51.63]Description.
[12:52.39]Just because.
[12:54.03]Just because.
[12:55.41]Just because.
[12:56.23]Just stand up.
[12:57.05]I just tried to hit W. Okay, just because you can't see something.
[13:01.14]Oh, wait.
[13:01.76]What about back here?
[13:02.44]There's some darkness here.
[13:04.12]This doesn't like bugs.
[13:05.00]Alright.
[13:05.26]Insect repellent.
[13:06.34]Okay.
[13:20.01]Insects?
[13:21.57]I hate insects.
[13:23.91]I can't stand insects.
[13:25.53]Somebody's knocking at the door.
[13:26.69]I have to free myself.
[13:28.81]I have to free myself.
[13:31.07]What?
[13:32.85]What the fuck is this?
[13:34.85]Some things we may perceive differently at close range than we would from far away.
[13:40.68]I can't see any- Wait a minute.
[13:44.20]Oh, wow!
[13:44.84]If I back up really far, I know the code!
[13:47.66]It's 34073!
[13:51.88]Okay.
[13:53.40]Three, wait.
[13:54.17]Three, four, zero, seven, three.
[13:55.71]All right, we got a three.
[13:58.91]Three, four, zero, 73.
[14:00.71]Bingo.
[14:03.07]Now we can start the game.
[14:06.44]So, chest.
[14:07.82]Maybe we need to keep the chest.
[14:10.52]Guys, there are choices in this game too.
[14:11.98]This game has choices.
[14:12.86]We're not done with this yet.
[14:14.30]Everyone just calm down.
[14:15.12]We just got out of the chair, okay?
[14:18.89]This is a picture of Sarah.
[14:23.81]Okay.
[14:24.27]Any weird shit I can do here?
[14:25.75]I can tilt it around.
[14:27.85]Upside down?
[14:30.53]Upside down, it looks like somebody else, right?
[14:33.31]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[14:35.03]Is it a duck or a rabbit?
[14:35.95]If you turn it upside down, it's a rabbit.
[14:37.05]If you turn it right side up, it's a duck.
[14:39.47]What animal is this?
[14:40.91]What's this trying to tell me?
[14:47.10]We got a rabbit situation here?
[14:51.44]Is she cross-eyed?
[14:57.03]I can't tell.
[14:59.15]Well, we know that's there.
[15:00.81]Okay, this is a dictaphone.
[15:02.69]Okay.
[15:03.01]Okay.
[15:03.25]Spin it really fast.
[15:16.57]My dictaphone turned itself on during the accident.
[15:18.78]What is a dictaphone?
[15:20.22]Sarah said, sir.
[15:21.82]Who was this person?
[15:23.18]Anyone know what a dictaphone is?
[15:24.32]What has he done to her?
[15:26.04]Why did he not help us?
[15:28.28]Maybe it was illusion.
[15:29.64]This thing looks like a talkback from Home Alone.
[15:34.93]Let's spin it.
[15:36.11]This is a picture of my wife, Sarah.
[15:41.29]I don't think this is doing anything.
[15:43.61]This is just giving me... Look, my headache meter is going up.
[15:48.77]Okay.
[15:48.93]Wait.
[15:49.71]We got some movement here.
[15:53.19]Not quite.
[15:55.29]Hmm.
[15:55.79]Got that piece.
[15:56.55]No.
[15:56.75]Okay.
[15:57.37]That's the code.
[15:57.93]We already got that code.
[16:00.15]Matches.
[16:00.55]We got chest in here.
[16:01.63]No.
[16:02.57]Let's take the phone.
[16:03.47]What about these chains?
[16:05.26]Poster.
[16:12.50]On the other side, in Dorset, we explain unexplained.
[16:15.30]Radio Dorset FM, 85.5.
[16:17.90]Mike and Steve in the morning.
[16:18.92]Okay, 85.5.
[16:19.60]Remember that.
[16:20.84]Somebody's got to remember that one.
[16:21.78]Spin this around.
[16:23.76]Would you look at that, guys.
[16:26.17]Look at that.
[16:26.97]Sometimes you've got to see things from the other side.
[16:28.49]Uh, 5.
[16:33.31]That's a G. That's GG8.
[16:39.16]That's a BB-8.
[16:39.64]It's trying to tell me something about the new movie.
[16:42.53]Okay.
[16:45.79]I forget what it was.
[16:46.61]Newspaper.
[16:47.47]Illusion hits again.
[16:48.93]Bug on the eye.
[17:02.69]I don't care.
[17:03.73]Can I just open the door?
[17:04.63]Okay, we'll get some question marks.
[17:08.63]Okay, so I got a code here, keypad.
[17:11.53]Okay.
[17:11.79]We have to deduce the code here.
[17:28.17]It's broken.
[17:28.47]Inscription.
[17:29.69]Anything on the ground?
[17:30.49]Piece of paper.
[17:30.95]Okay.
[17:31.09]I did not kill her.
[17:31.81]A clock?
[17:32.17]Phone?
[17:32.57]Unlock the phone and call for help.
[17:33.55]Dial 112.
[17:56.76]Okay, did I bring up a phone or am I scared it's a grenade?
[18:01.32]You know what I mean?
[18:01.98]Like, oh shit.
[18:03.24]I don't know if this is, this might be dangerous.
[18:05.38]What was the, how am I?
[18:07.16]I need the pin number.
[18:08.70]112.
[18:11.23]What's the pin number?
[18:15.81]What's the pin?
[18:19.43]I don't know.
[18:20.93]Throw it at the door.
[18:27.07]Let me do my pin number and see if it works.
[18:35.12]Shit.
[18:37.70]112 is emergency EU services.
[18:39.48]Oh, okay.
[18:41.02]So how do I unlock the phone?
[18:45.14]It's got to be like part of this.
[18:46.08]It's got to be on a photo or something.
[18:48.48]Did I put my cell phone number in the newspaper?
[18:51.96]Going into our informant. 42...
[18:57.32]Uh, however, due to insufficient funds... I don't know.
[19:00.74]I have no idea.
[19:02.34]I gotta get open this chest.
[19:03.30]What?
[19:03.48]We got a key on the ground here.
[19:04.34]Bingo.
[19:05.48]How do I get to the inventory faster?
[19:08.84]Thank you.
[19:09.24]Okay, there's the key.
[19:09.94]Times one.
[19:10.58]Open up the chest.
[19:11.20]Okay, that's it?
[19:12.46]What is this?
[19:17.45]A bottle of Ivan Ooze.
[19:19.23]Bottle.
[19:20.63]Did you kill her?
[19:21.39]Did you?
[19:22.31]Did you kill her?
[19:25.12]I did not kill her.
[19:27.70]I did not.
[19:28.52]Am I making like a Molotov cocktail?
[19:30.54]Maybe I should... I did not kill her.
[19:38.28]Oh, that's so... Why?
[19:39.48]Hold on.
[19:39.78]I need to hear that one more time.
[19:42.06]Did you kill her?
[19:42.82]Did you?
[19:45.76]I love it.
[19:49.01]Can I combine items?
[19:52.17]Okay, so here we go.
[19:55.87]I got the Wizard of Oz here.
[19:57.51]I got the Tin Man.
[19:58.25]I got the Cowardly Lion.
[20:01.06]I've got the Scarecrow.
[20:02.74]And then I've got Dorothy.
[20:05.42]So which one of these... Which one of these is gonna get me a new heart?
[20:12.36]I don't know.
[20:15.04]I'm going to have to pull up the scarecrow here.
[20:17.12]To light up a match, place the end of it next to the striker strip, then hold the left mouse button and make a quick move down a slight angle.
[20:27.36]Oh, shit.
[20:29.66]There it is.
[20:30.91]Okay, so I have a... Can I just... I don't understand.
[20:41.29]What can I do with this?
[20:44.24]That doesn't do anything.
[20:46.44]Endgame.
[20:47.98]Revolutionary Game Club.
[20:50.38]Alright, I'm gonna burn the photo.
[20:53.12]Check it out.
[20:56.88]Come on.
[20:57.26]I need to burn this photo.
[21:02.57]I can't turn it this way?
[21:03.43]Like, light the match over here.
[21:05.83]Ready?
[21:08.33]Here we go.
[21:09.07]Switch!
[21:09.39]Oh.
[21:09.59]Oh.
[21:14.70]I just shut the light up.
[21:16.18]Wait, wait, wait.
[21:17.04]Where's my hand?
[21:17.86]There it is.
[21:19.14]My floating magician box.
[21:22.22]Oh, come on.
[21:24.44]Much better.
[21:25.28]Let me do that again.
[21:27.35]I hope you don't run out of these.
[21:28.41]I've got a note here.
[21:35.45]Okay, I visited the old bitty.
[21:38.93]Didn't want to kill her.
[21:40.03]It's not my fault.
[21:40.95]She woke up when I was pulling out the jewelry.
[21:43.05]Can I go now?
[21:43.81]Can you let me go?
[21:45.67]And here we go.
[21:48.81]Nothing.
[21:52.63]Damn it.
[21:53.51]One of these days I'm going to turn this around and it's going to be real.
[21:57.53]Okay, let's try that again.
[21:59.19]Matches.
[22:02.55]Somebody said I'm going too fast.
[22:06.01]Doing what that's not how matches work.
[22:09.34]What the fuck I'm gonna get this right hold on Nearly okay, but I must do nearly okay Get over there, what's wrong?
[22:30.01]Oh my god.
[22:30.59]Why could I?
[22:33.01]I'm doing it right.
[22:33.71]Let's go.
[22:33.97]Let's try it this way.
[22:35.19]Keep holding mouse one.
[22:36.01]That's what I'm doing.
[22:38.25]I'm holding mouse one right now.
[22:39.31]It just blows out.
[22:39.89]There's only like three dozen of these.
[22:49.98]Why is it staying on now?
[22:54.12]I'm so confused.
[22:57.86]After I light it, move it slowly.
[23:07.24]Didn't I?
[23:07.72]Wait, can I grab the rat?
[23:10.14]I might need to grab the rat.
[23:11.10]Yeah, I think I need to get the rat.
[23:18.18]Rat.
[23:19.12]Oh, come on.
[23:21.88]How could you be this bad at lighting fucking matches?
[23:25.80]Don't pull the hand down yet.
[23:26.90]Don't talk?
[23:39.73]Am I blowing out the matches with my voice?
[23:43.35]Did you kill her?
[23:45.12]Did you?
[23:46.96]What's that supposed to mean?
[23:49.30]Sarah?
[23:50.58]If I type in the code in the panel next to me, I will unlock this door.
[24:03.83]Nearly okay.
[24:04.91]Nearly okay.
[24:40.95]Where's the inscription?
[24:42.91]I don't- shit.
[24:45.15]I don't understand.
[24:48.36]Do I need to turn the light off?
[24:52.28]Let's turn the light off.
[24:53.76]Get the fuck up here.
[25:17.81]No, I gotta grab the rat.
[25:20.29]Let's get the rat.
[25:21.41]When he runs by, I'm gonna grab him.
[25:27.13]The fact that I'm just like sitting there.
[25:32.41]Blowing out the matches with my mouth.
[25:35.15]I can't open the door.
[25:35.79]I need the key code.
[25:41.04]Can I grab the pipe?
[25:41.84]I can't.
[25:48.49]I can't burn the rag after I wet it with the juice.
[25:57.59]How do I do that, though?
[26:01.93]I can't really dump it anywhere.
[26:09.37]There was a valve right there.
[26:10.81]Hold on.
[26:12.27]I gotta be quiet.
[26:45.83]What does that do?
[26:46.75]God, that's why I whispered.
[26:49.71]What did that do?
[26:55.68]What did it even do?
[27:00.02]Anti-clockwise.
[27:01.92]Hold on, I gotta shut up again.
[27:16.70]I hate that I can't talk when I do this!
[27:23.63]I can't, like, I wish I could speak.
[27:46.15]just because you can't see something it doesn't mean it doesn't exist what's this inscription like I can't talk when I have that thing out it's freaking me out all right so hold on so the valve is right there I don't know what the hell that even does this like can I use this can I do anything with this clean the floor clean something
[28:18.31]No, let's not do anything.
[28:19.60]Hold on.
[28:20.26]Let's try this again.
[28:29.46]Can't burn this?
[28:32.69]Clean the rat.
[28:33.55]That's not gonna do anything.
[28:36.97]Scrub the inscription.
[28:38.13]I mean, I guess I could try that.
[28:40.29]How can I use this?
[28:44.65]I need to light the match.
[28:46.31]I need a second hand.
[28:47.77]Alright, shut up.
[28:55.31]God damn it!
[28:59.12]I know, I don't need to, I'm not going to clean the room.
[29:03.06]That's not going to do anything.
[29:05.18]Cleaning the room is not going to fucking help me.
[29:07.74]Clean the picture, clean the blood off of here.
[29:09.64]It's 2-2-2-2!
[29:17.25]Oh my god.
[29:17.95]2-2.
[29:23.28]How's that incorrect?
[29:24.42]2-2-2-4.
[29:27.58]2-2-2-4.
[29:28.06]Oh, shut up.
[29:32.64]That's a code to something else?
[29:35.26]Wait, the telephone.
[29:38.73]Hold on, let me just Ren and Stimpy hold this up.
[29:40.53]2-2-2.
[29:44.20]Got it.
[29:45.52]Call the police.
[29:47.44]Call 112.
[29:47.98]Give a new text.
[29:51.86]Press enter.
[29:54.16]Phone.
[29:54.83]Enter the number.
[29:55.89]Where's my- how do I get to my texts?
[29:57.31]I feel like a fucking old lady trying to go through my phone for the first time.
[30:02.07]No, I want menu.
[30:03.45]Settings.
[30:04.77]Ringtone type.
[30:08.85]That one's alright.
[30:15.60]Hmm?
[30:17.90]Default?
[30:18.56]Nah, I think... I like ringtone.
[30:21.02]Ringtone 2 is probably the best one.
[30:22.33]Alright, that's good.
[30:24.57]Alright, what about, um... Notepad.
[30:27.41]Robert, you can make notes here.
[30:28.83]This code may be useful to you.
[30:30.23]8-4-2-6.
[30:31.31]Do not delete the note.
[30:33.15]Okay, 8-4-2-6.
[30:33.91]Information.
[30:35.84]Game time.
[30:39.30]Snake record.
[30:41.18]What do you mean, snake record?
[30:46.04]Oh, what?
[30:50.46]I could play Snake on this phone, just... Oh, shit.
[30:58.15]He's angry.
[30:58.93]He's like, you're supposed to be playing my game, not the game on the phone, you prick.
[31:04.09]Play my fucked up game.
[31:08.27]No, wait.
[31:09.45]I want to do it again.
[31:10.07]I want to play Snake.
[31:10.95]I don't care about this guy.
[31:14.91]He's not gonna come back angry, is he?
[31:17.85]I don't like this snake.
[31:18.61]I don't like how you go across the other screen.
[31:22.37]See, I don't like that.
[31:22.97]That's bullshit.
[31:23.99]I gotta do at least 50.
[31:24.97]You guys wanna know a nice snake tactic?
[31:33.81]Just ride the edge of the screen.
[31:36.79]You just keep riding the edge of the screen until you get to a giant spiral.
[31:40.57]And then, I mean, you just screw it anyways.
[31:42.60]What happened?
[31:45.27]Did I win?
[31:47.67]How did I get the bug off my screen?
[31:50.55]Did I lose?
[31:55.63]Change game?
[31:56.25]I just did.
[31:56.66]Everybody that was telling me, like, ditch this game, play something else.
[31:59.68]We're playing Worm now.
[32:00.46]We're playing Snake.
[32:04.40]This is a game within a game.
[32:07.84]I must have ran into myself.
[32:08.89]I need to get to 50.
[32:09.33]Or at least 25.
[32:13.61]That was a risky move.
[32:14.67]So was that.
[32:15.03]I got it.
[32:19.24]13.
[32:20.76]25 is my goal.
[32:22.72]And then I unlock... The scary jigsaw is going to come back at 25.
[32:30.14]I don't lie, guys.
[32:31.40]I want you to seriously tell me the truth.
[32:33.84]You got all these random codes you have to remember and all this dumb bullshit.
[32:37.37]And you know you... What?
[32:39.89]Alright, I got to 25.
[32:42.41]Messages.
[32:43.67]It's from Patrick Clark.
[32:45.95]Robert, where are you?
[32:46.89]I cannot get hold of you.
[32:48.81]I might know who the illusion is within the next hour.
[32:51.31]Okay.
[32:54.62]Space fighter.
[32:56.72]Oh my god, there's even another- there's another game on here!
[32:59.18]This is perfect!
[33:01.38]Hold on, I'll get it.
[33:08.98]Robert!
[33:09.90]I might have some secret information on who the killer is!
[33:13.38]But I'm just gonna play Space Fighter for a little while.
[33:16.86]It sounds like fun.
[33:22.96]I don't care at all, apparently.
[33:24.53]I gotta- I have to kill the boss.
[33:27.29]I can't let... This game can't beat me.
[33:28.97]I have to win.
[33:31.74]He's way too hard.
[33:40.70]Who cares about the murder mystery?
[33:42.69]Then there's this.
[33:44.67]Who cares?
[33:45.15]Are you gonna die?
[33:51.84]Okay, that's almost impossible to get away from.
[33:53.54]I have to like... I have to clear the area.
[33:56.44]And then he's going to dive in.
[33:57.50]What the fuck?
[34:02.15]I already forgot the code.
[34:08.49]There it is.
[34:16.34]Those things even hurt you?
[34:27.69]Don't talk, you'll blow the game out.
[34:41.30]I can't stop.
[34:43.08]I can't stop.
[34:44.24]I have to beat it.
[34:48.75]Oh my god!
[34:56.84]Just relax!
[34:58.56]Oh!
[35:03.60]Relax!
[35:05.83]Stop breathing!
[35:16.03]OH!
[35:50.06]Get that bug off the fucking screen.
[35:51.46]Get off the screen, you're gonna ruin everything, bug.
[35:54.43]Oh my god, I can't help it.
[35:57.69]Just using the keyboard and the screen is a tiny screen inside of my screen.
[36:01.93]It's like I'm watching over somebody else's shoulder play a fucking game on their cell phone, but I'm telling them what to do and I'm controlling their brain.
[36:16.27]It's my brain can't do it.
[36:17.43]My brain just can't handle it.
[36:18.60]I can't do it.
[36:29.99]What was that?
[36:38.81]Oh yeah, I was supposed to call the police.
[36:40.18]Hold on, get me out of Space Fighter.
[36:44.16]Where's the phone?
[36:45.76]Phone!
[36:46.32]Police!
[36:46.76]I need help immediately!
[36:47.92]God damn it.
[36:51.60]It's breaking up.
[36:53.00]The receptionist.
[36:54.52]There must be another reason.
[36:56.74]Maybe I'll try again later.
[37:05.79]Riddle 1.0?
[37:06.21]I don't... 8?
[37:08.69]What was it?
[37:09.17]I don't even remember.
[37:09.71]I had a... No, bring the phone back up.
[37:11.81]Bring back the phone!
[37:16.56]Fucking space... Alright, last time.
[37:18.38]This is the last time I'm gonna play this.
[37:22.28]This is it.
[37:25.28]Oh, my hands are locking up.
[37:27.72]I have to beat this guy.
[37:28.49]I don't even care if I have to shoot him one time.
[37:36.45]Okay, you can't hit those.
[37:37.49]That changes everything.
[37:38.17]I thought you actually ran into these buildings.
[37:44.19]I'm going to shoot him one bullet and then dodge.
[37:52.14]Every time I do the same thing.
[37:53.72]I do the same thing every time.
[37:59.32]Why is it going faster?
[38:03.20]What?
[38:05.32]You guys don't understand like just how hard it is to do this.
[38:10.49]I'm leaning into my screen right now to even see.
[38:12.67]I can't fucking do it, man.
[38:17.58]It's too fucking small.
[38:19.60]I need my glasses.
[38:44.21]You dick!
[39:16.02]Come on, I gotta get the high score.
[39:17.29]Who cares about my murdered wife?
[39:23.45]When's he gonna go?
[39:23.89]When's he gonna do it?
[39:29.10]What?
[39:29.40]Hey!
[39:29.82]Hey!
[39:50.97]Why is it going so fast?!
[39:51.81]It speeds up!
[40:21.31]No, why?
[40:22.84]Why?
[40:23.38]I don't want to play this anymore.
[40:24.82]I don't want to do this anymore.
[40:31.24]This is the real prison.
[40:33.56]I think I'm like tied up in some fucking psycho jigsaw's basement.
[40:36.90]Nope.
[40:38.12]This is the real jail.
[40:40.99]I'm gonna be here for eternity trying to beat this stupid flying meatball and space fighter.
[40:51.11]This is not a joke, I have to beat this.
[41:11.40]See!
[41:12.86]Why does it do that?
[41:17.44]I promise I'm not crazy.
[41:37.28]I did it!
[41:37.60]Okay.
[41:47.57]I did it.
[41:49.17]I did it.
[41:54.00]I won.
[41:56.56]Alright.
[41:56.86]Something about a killed wife.
[41:59.36]My wife's dead.
[42:00.92]I can get back to that now.
[42:02.29]What was the code that Gary sent me?
[42:04.13]Whatever it was.
[42:08.52]I need my phone again.
[42:13.42]I need to get out of the first room of this game.
[42:15.84]All right.
[42:16.10]Messages.
[42:18.06]What was it?
[42:18.36]8-4... Somebody sent me a message.
[42:23.05]Notepad.
[42:23.47]8-4-2-6.
[42:25.39]So, 8-4-2-6.
[42:25.77]We're gonna try it right here.
[42:28.09]There it is.
[42:28.91]We can leave now.
[42:30.71]Let's give it a try.
[42:42.12]How do you... Oh, there he is.
[42:44.68]No.
[42:46.10]We're gonna have to go ahead and close that.
[42:47.52]Okay, he's gone now.
[42:52.27]Just go through?
[42:52.81]We're going through.
[42:55.97]Welcome to... the game.
[43:02.91]Hello.
[43:09.34]Play with me.
[43:12.94]Who is this?
[43:19.14]Who was that?
[43:19.72]I knew that was a perfect ringtone.
[43:23.10]All right, so we have a brassiere.
[43:28.43]I could set fire to it.
[43:29.61]You can light up the brassiere.
[43:30.75]This brassiere could actually warm me up.
[43:34.75]We do have some event.
[43:38.98]The chest?
[43:40.16]Of course it has a keypad.
[43:40.98]Everything has a fucking keypad in this game.
[43:42.80]I need to find the code.
[43:46.67]Patrick?
[43:47.49]Patrick Clark?
[43:48.13]Patrick Clark?
[43:51.03]Uh... Patrick?
[43:52.71]Patrick Clark?
[43:53.69]So, alright, let's go ahead and, uh, might as well light that up.
[43:58.69]What's wrong with my face?
[44:02.79]I sneezed and didn't wipe my nose.
[44:04.20]What's going on with my face?
[44:05.02]Nearly okay, but I'm nearly okay.
[44:17.79]How do I light that?
[44:22.58]It just said you could... Oh, there's a fire here.
[44:26.56]Am I freezing to death?
[44:36.87]I can't put this in the... That's weird.
[44:39.67]Okay.
[44:40.17]There's another phone.
[44:43.45]To be honest,
[44:44.78]I thought we would spend this evening together.
[44:48.70]At the end of the day, today's your birthday.
[44:51.70]Oh, shit, I just cut her off.
[44:52.62]There's a pig head over here.
[44:56.88]I hate not... I could set fire, good idea.
[44:59.94]Ooh, okay.
[45:00.62]I could do with some fire.
[45:04.68]To warm yourself with a mat.
[45:06.00]I have to stop talking every time I do this.
[45:08.31]Nearly okay.
[45:10.31]At least now I have more time before I freeze.
[45:12.61]There we go.
[45:13.46]Alright, now let's look over here.
[45:18.37]My freeze phase is going away.
[45:19.63]Alright, quiet.
[45:31.08]Got a note.
[45:33.32]Find and use the antidote to slow down the poison.
[45:35.84]Green syringe in the chest will slow down the poison in your body.
[45:38.66]Will you risk it?
[45:42.00]Risk what?
[45:45.13]So I have to syringe myself.
[45:48.06]This thing says 90.
[45:49.94]Plus 90.
[45:51.60]I must be doing great then.
[45:55.24]I got a key.
[45:57.45]I'm assuming you use the key on the chest.
[45:59.43]No, it's a stupid code.
[46:02.25]Anything else locked over here?
[46:07.71]Another code.
[46:08.48]Everything's a code.
[46:09.56]Fuck your codes.
[46:10.42]Something on the ground over there.
[46:11.68]18 plus.
[46:36.97]Alright, so, 18 plus 90... Plus 18 plus... Hold on, okay, okay.
[46:46.05]Plus 90, plus 18... This should slow down the lowering of the temperature.
[46:55.81]So, 18, 90?
[46:56.01]The chest has a key back.
[46:58.91]What about, no, 90, 18?
[46:59.67]The chest has a key back.
[47:06.27]1890.
[47:06.31]No, because this is probably another number.
[47:08.97]Quick math.
[47:10.31]Yeah, but this is not a denomination of math.
[47:13.35]Plus 18 plus.
[47:15.73]Plus 90.
[47:16.11]There's definitely going to be an equal sign somewhere around here.
[47:19.47]There has to be.
[47:26.17]There's going to be a something plus something equals minus something equals something.
[47:30.90]Let's get another match out here.
[47:34.34]What do I mean by that?
[47:35.05]Hold on.
[47:50.61]Minus nine.
[47:58.81]Some things we may perceive differently at close range than we would from... Close range.
[48:03.90]Okay, I'm leaning really close in here.
[48:06.74]Some things we may perceive at close range than we would from... My face is like almost in front of the screen.
[48:17.30]What is it talking about?
[48:21.52]Here comes the jump scare.
[48:24.34]Some things may be perceived at close range.
[48:29.91]So we've got minus 9.
[48:30.93]Oh, shit.
[48:31.23]Okay, minus 11, plus 90, plus 18, plus... I'm gonna die in here.
[48:46.14]We have minus... Minus 12.
[48:47.47]Fuck.
[48:47.67]Turn it up?
[48:48.15]This is not... This is not like a fucking blackened decker.
[48:51.23]Like home heating system.
[48:52.19]Okay.
[49:11.66]Thermometer show... Thermometer shows... Thermometer shows... The temperature is still dropping.
[49:19.00]I have to hurry up.
[49:20.18]Die.
[49:20.56]Otherwise, it doesn't fit.
[49:23.06]Wait.
[49:23.60]Key.
[49:24.06]How can I use... Okay.
[49:25.62]Done.
[49:26.02]It's open.
[49:27.08]Done.
[49:27.64]What is it?
[49:28.46]It's empty.
[49:29.04]Sir Binge.
[49:32.84]I feel better, but only a bit.
[49:34.94]I feel fine now.
[49:37.80]But I'm still freezing to death.
[49:40.99]thermometer shows the temperature is still dropping I have to have a candle is burning already this should slow down the lowering of the temperature is there anything else I can do I feel like this is the number 18 40 is it 18 40 40 18 the chest has a keypad incorrect code it's gonna be minus 16 oh no
[50:10.25]There's nothing else here, I don't think.
[50:12.25]There's a pig head.
[50:12.95]Does a pig head have anything in his mouth or something?
[50:15.05]Before I die?
[50:15.57]No, I mean, so do math.
[50:26.26]So, 18 plus 90.
[50:29.52]That gives me a three-digit number, not a four-digit number.
[50:35.65]That's 108.
[50:35.87]That's it?
[50:36.07]108.
[50:36.09]108 minus 20.
[50:37.83]So that's 98.
[50:38.53]88.
[50:38.71]So it's 58. 0108?
[51:01.32]18 equals 90 plus 21.
[51:01.92]It's not 0108.
[51:02.74]It's not 1080.
[51:03.14]What do you guys think this is?
[51:04.34]A snowboarding game?
[51:05.16]Come on.
[51:07.36]It's 22.
[51:07.56]Look at my fingers.
[51:08.46]Oh, wait.
[51:08.84]I can leave.
[51:10.08]I'll just leave the room.
[51:32.64]I'm all right.
[51:33.02]Okay, I'm safe in here now.
[51:36.30]Let's try it again.
[51:47.09]And we're back to where we were.
[51:49.63]Hey, look at that.
[51:50.89]Beautiful.
[51:52.17]Oh, shit.
[51:53.03]Okay, I need to clean more of the blood.
[51:56.52]I have to hurry up.
[51:58.06]Otherwise, I'll freeze.
[52:02.40]There's nothing else here.
[52:03.18]It's just plus 18.
[52:04.00]I can't wipe this thing off.
[52:06.14]Ha, no.
[52:06.36]Is it 2, 2, 2, 4?
[52:06.70]No, that was just... Is something in there?
[52:09.94]Clean away the frost.
[52:12.83]I can't wipe the frost.
[52:15.75]What is this here for?
[52:17.15]Look at that.
[52:17.53]That's very conspicuous.
[52:32.39]Anything else over this way?
[52:33.23]Can I do anything with my cell phone?
[52:38.15]The tape!
[52:39.21]Oh yeah, I forgot, I cut it off.
[52:40.15]At the end of the day, it's your birthday!
[52:43.19]You have minus 12!
[52:52.34]During last year, you have spent more time with this detective of yours than you have ever spent with me.
[52:58.19]Sarah, please.
[52:59.15]Please say a number.
[53:00.19]I have been writing about illusion for three years.
[53:03.05]Three.
[53:03.95]If Patrick's telling me he found the only person who ran away from him, then I have to speak to him.
[53:11.35]You never have time for me.
[53:13.19]You know what?
[53:13.69]Somebody say a number.
[53:14.25]I'm getting sick of it.
[53:16.33]I'll be back as soon as I can.
[53:18.49]Come on.
[53:18.89]Say a number!
[53:19.67]Oh, and by the way, honey, I know about our favorite anniversary.
[53:23.56]Plus 102.
[53:23.92]Come on, really?
[53:50.95]Patrick?
[53:52.25]Patrick Clark?
[53:53.41]Wait, can we go back?
[53:54.13]I feel like there's something in the other area there.
[54:00.04]The chest has a keypad.
[54:02.04]You need a code.
[54:05.04]Incorrect code.
[54:05.60]I need to use our brains here.
[54:06.58]I need to use my brain.
[54:08.31]Let's use it.
[54:10.09]Minus 30.
[54:11.29]You would not be alive here.
[54:14.37]I have to hurry up.
[54:15.93]Otherwise, I'll freeze.
[54:20.71]What about turning off the valve here?
[54:26.60]Because there is the valve here.
[54:28.60]If we turn that back, should we turn it the other way?
[54:33.18]What does this do?
[54:38.35]Okay, the valve is turned.
[54:39.13]What about something in here?
[54:42.61]Price, wait a minute.
[54:44.09]17th of August, 1999.
[54:44.69]$1.50.
[54:44.71]152 copies.
[54:45.17]152.
[54:45.23]So I've got 17, 1999, 152, 150.
[54:58.72]So if we take the 17, add it to 1999, that would be 2016.
[55:00.28]2016 circulating, so that would be divided by 152.
[55:02.48]152 divided by 2016 is... That's 11.
[55:03.20]11 plus 150.
[55:04.09]That is 12.
[55:04.63]That is 13.
[55:05.49]Unlucky number 13.
[55:06.11]Let's go.
[55:26.48]Did I actually just save my life here?
[55:27.92]No.
[55:28.32]How can I still be fine?
[55:29.04]Go back to the mobile games.
[55:52.92]Yeah, the syringe.
[55:55.88]What was the other note here?
[55:59.52]Some things may proceed differently at close range than we would from.
[56:02.78]What does this mean?
[56:03.56]What if I go back?
[56:08.30]Okay, I'm leaning back right now.
[56:09.58]Are you fucking serious?
[56:20.20]Oh my god.
[56:21.20]Okay, 98.
[56:22.16]I didn't know I was strong enough to move this.
[56:25.57]98 plus 18.
[56:28.87]Plus 40.
[56:29.19]98.
[56:29.57]Okay, we got 98.
[56:33.88]Plus 14.
[56:34.22]No, plus 18.
[56:37.34]Plus 40.
[56:37.82]That would be 156.
[56:39.60]Thank you very much.
[56:41.08]That'd be 0156.
[56:42.18]Okay, let's go with, uh... So that's 1890.
[56:43.52]Plus 23.
[56:43.92]That's... Then minus the care of the one.
[56:46.94]Okay.
[56:47.08]Got it.
[56:47.28]Good.
[56:59.45]Let's try that again.
[57:02.05]We got 98.
[57:02.43]98 plus 18.
[57:03.53]We got a plus 90.
[57:08.39]That's 206.
[57:09.73]0206.
[57:09.75]Yes, I have a calculator right here.
[57:15.62]Is 98 86?
[57:31.49]There's no equal sign anywhere.
[57:33.01]Do I have to be like close to something?
[57:40.14]I'd be staring at something.
[57:46.14]Give me the note again.
[57:51.00]I'm staring.
[57:52.74]Close range than we would from... This is as close as I can get.
[57:57.16]I can't get closer than this.
[58:05.14]Than we would from what?
[58:15.51]Look harder.
[58:16.87]What am I supposed to be looking at?
[58:22.85]The blood?
[58:23.45]I mean, I'm thumbing as far as you can get.
[58:26.82]98, 18.
[58:28.14]That's a 9.
[58:30.80]That's a 9.
[58:31.20]That's a 90.
[58:38.75]98 plus 18 plus 90.
[58:41.87]Wait a minute.
[58:42.35]981890.
[58:42.37]981890.
[58:43.13]Come on.
[58:43.67]981840.
[58:43.71]What?
[58:43.99]Give me a break.
[58:44.63]That's so... 981840.
[58:44.96]That's not a 48.
[58:45.44]It's upside down.
[59:04.99]8-6-8-1-0-4?
[59:05.13]8-6-8-1-0-4.
[59:05.45]Correct code.
[59:06.67]48 plus in the blood on the ground?
[59:10.47]That's a 4?
[59:11.26]No, that's a 7.
[59:12.46]Is that a 7 or is that a fucking 1?
[59:17.58]I don't know.
[59:32.62]98, 98, 78, 40.
[59:32.86]They didn't write this clear enough.
[59:43.31]That's not a 48.
[59:43.83]What is the temperature?
[59:45.01]It's minus 30.
[59:45.49]Look up?
[59:45.85]Look up at what?
[59:47.75]There's nothing up here.
[59:48.95]Oh, I'm so dead.
[60:10.71]1-8-9-8-9-0.
[60:10.85]1-8-9-8-9-0.
[60:10.97]No.
[60:11.31]Give me a match.
[60:12.63]I gotta be quiet.
[61:09.83]900, 800, 500.
[61:10.55]I'm not muted.
[61:12.23]I just can't talk when I have a matchup because the game is pumped into my microphone.
[61:16.36]The devs can hear everything I'm saying right now.
[61:21.26]I can't move the pig, no.
[61:23.23]And I'm moments away from dying.
[61:24.57]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[61:27.15]I thought it was 156.
[61:28.11]156, zero?
[61:28.23]156, like up here?
[61:28.57]No.
[61:28.67]Stop with one, then work your way up.
[61:30.91]One?
[61:31.03]Math with the upside down number.
[61:54.03]But if that was an upside-down number, that would just be O. It would be O-H.
[62:01.65]I'm missing something else.
[62:02.51]4-6-40.
[62:06.73]Just brute.
[62:07.59]Above the fans?
[62:08.11]Hold on.
[62:28.76]I'm just trying to clean this whole place up.
[62:30.32]I don't want to be the cleaner.
[62:32.18]Look close above the fan.
[62:33.10]It's just a frozen... That's not words or anything.
[63:00.47]Shit.
[63:03.35]Look harder.
[63:05.83]Look harder?
[63:07.19]There's nothing else to look at.
[63:08.65]I can't look at anything else.
[63:10.17]I'm leaning in so far.
[63:11.67]We have 98 plus 18 plus plus 90.
[63:13.92]The only thing I can think of here
[63:28.85]is that this is the end?
[63:39.30]Look at the blood at a distance and you'll see a number.
[63:43.54]How far back do I need to go here?
[63:45.04]I'm very far back, I don't see anything.
[63:46.60]I just see like smeared, maybe like a smeared seven.
[63:50.41]Minus 29.
[63:59.90]Alright, so if that's 86, right?
[64:02.90]Then that would mean that we start here.
[64:09.28]Right?
[64:10.44]That O is... What would that be?
[64:12.60]06?
[64:12.98]I don't even know what the hell this would be.
[64:23.48]The temperature isn't dropping anymore.
[64:29.09]The blood says 48.
[64:30.53]I should slow down the lowering of the... 98.
[64:34.77]Let's just try this one thing.
[64:36.49]98 plus 48 plus 90. 236.
[64:48.96]Correct code.
[64:51.90]98 plus 48 plus 40.
[64:54.98]186.
[64:55.04]The chest has a key back.
[64:58.22]The chest has a key back.
[65:00.60]1860.
[65:01.68]Correct code.
[65:03.42]984818.
[65:03.44]The chest has a key back.
[65:06.18]984818.
[65:07.18]Correct code.
[65:08.20]We're just going to be here all day.
[65:10.50]We're never going to figure this out.
[65:14.28]That says 18.
[65:15.06]This should slow down the lowering of the temperature.
[65:21.63]98 plus 7 plus 18 plus 40.
[65:34.10]Just Google it.
[65:35.56]Well, then we're defeated.
[65:36.68]That has to be something else.
[65:43.77]It could also be 78.
[65:44.91]I mean, it could.
[65:45.83]It's just, it's very unclear.
[65:47.39]Plus 18 plus...
[65:53.33]The chest has a keypad.
[65:56.31]Incorrect code.
[65:58.71]Plus 86.
[65:59.19]I said, but why would that be upside down?
[66:07.50]So then it would be 86.
[66:12.42]Plus, is there another number somewhere?
[66:18.18]Only one, yeah, this is the only, what if this is the right side up, one of these are upside down?
[66:29.03]Above the fans and the ice, look closely.
[66:36.26]There ain't nothing here.
[66:38.00]There's nothing here.
[66:40.02]It's a squiggly line.
[66:41.12]I don't think I can move anything else.
[66:45.76]Patrick?
[66:46.36]Patrick?
[66:47.82]Patrick Clark?
[66:49.21]Nothing over here does anything.
[66:50.47]Let me just... Hold on.
[66:51.61]Let me try this.
[67:36.12]Add temperature.
[67:36.90]I can't.
[67:37.37]So wait, minus 29 maybe?
[67:38.09]Then plus 86?
[67:38.35]Just play Snake.
[67:39.93]Melt the ice above the fans.
[67:40.91]If this works.
[67:41.57]No, there's no way.
[68:12.49]No, it's not.
[68:13.25]Ugh.
[68:15.07]Alright, so let me just do something real quick.
[68:17.59]We are overcomplicating this.
[68:19.93]And when I get times like this, I ask a friend.
[68:23.35]And the friend is, um... No one's gonna know that this game just came out, like, fucking, like, seven hours ago.
[68:29.84]Electronic line.
[68:34.58]In this keypad, I can enter code.
[68:39.15]Incorrect code?
[68:48.27]But is this new?
[68:49.39]This is brand new.
[68:51.39]What about the phone?
[68:52.23]Can I like take a picture or something?
[68:58.57]No, there's more to this game.
[69:01.20]Once we get past this, we're gonna like, people die in this game.
[69:07.82]Hold on, what's the name of this game?
[69:09.98]Play for free?
[69:11.72]Play with yourself.
[69:12.40]What is it called?
[69:13.02]I forget.
[69:13.46]I made that, what is it?
[69:14.14]Play with me.
[69:18.72]I just want to know.
[69:19.72]I want to put it in the right direction.
[69:26.35]What if I just... Okay, hold on.
[69:27.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[69:28.21]Okay.
[69:30.14]What if we do 86... 98.
[69:30.74]I just want to try this.
[69:34.54]98 plus 18 plus 40 minus 29.
[69:36.22]That's 127.
[69:36.42]No.
[69:36.50]Incorrect code.
[69:37.96]Incorrect code.
[69:59.11]Watch this be something so easy.
[70:04.65]I don't even think there is... I don't think there's even any walkthroughs or anything.
[70:23.08]This is supposed to be a scary game.
[70:27.66]That's 100% a 48 in the blood?
[70:28.68]No, that's definitely not a 48.
[70:29.94]That's definitely a 1.
[70:30.86]Alright, hold on.
[70:31.68]Let's see.
[70:32.22]Did this game come out like... This game... This is like a shitty horror game.
[70:35.28]Is it 178?
[70:50.71]I don't think so.
[70:51.45]Unless this is supposed to be numbers and not pluses.
[70:54.25]What is T?
[70:55.43]T is a letter.
[70:57.74]Listen, that's not what I'm asking.
[70:59.82]That's not what I'm asking.
[71:06.09]Let's do 18 plus 86 plus 40.
[71:08.97]18 plus 86 plus 40.
[71:12.05]That's 144.
[71:15.75]Incorrect code.
[71:17.37]Incorrect code.
[71:21.77]T is not a letter.
[71:22.85]What are you talking about?
[71:23.51]T is a letter.
[71:24.11]Stop it.
[71:24.49]Don't confuse me.
[71:25.27]I'm already confused.
[71:26.73]This means something.
[71:31.44]I'm sorry.
[71:31.82]This means something.
[71:35.64]Why would this be here?
[71:36.44]You know what I'm saying?
[71:40.60]What the hell would the reason for this be?
[71:46.46]Oh, come on!
[71:47.96]Come on!
[71:48.84]You're telling me the scroll wheel?
[71:52.07]Oh my god!
[71:53.01]79639!
[71:53.03]Oh my god!
[71:59.37]The chest has a key back you need to come Fuck you game.
[72:04.73]It's stupid.
[72:06.29]That's stupid.
[72:07.77]That's stupid all right How did never nobody told me I could do this?
[72:13.57]And now we have another okay here.
[72:14.45]We go 98 98 plus 17 plus 18 plus fucking 40 is 173
[72:28.93]Oh, God damn it.
[72:33.76]Where are we now?
[72:34.54]117.
[72:34.74]One... Wait.
[72:35.56]98.
[72:35.58]98.
[72:35.60]Plus 17.
[72:43.32]Plus 18.
[72:45.27]Plus 90.
[72:45.53]Is 223.
[72:58.98]Oh my god.
[73:01.28]Minus 29.
[73:01.62]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[73:02.16]98.
[73:02.42]Plus 17.
[73:02.70]Plus 18.
[73:03.10]Plus 40.
[73:03.34]Minus 29.
[73:03.56]144.
[73:03.58]That's 19.
[73:04.30]That's not a 19.
[73:04.94]I can't even zoom in.
[73:06.14]That's a 7.
[73:35.10]Where do we start?
[73:35.62]Alright, well, here's the thing.
[73:36.78]This has to be the last number.
[73:37.72]90 plus... Yeah, that is clearly a 7.
[73:39.84]That's not a 9.
[73:40.39]That's not an F. That's not a T. They're both 17 and 18.
[73:42.03]So that's plus 86.
[73:42.51]So we got 86...
[74:04.37]86 plus 17 plus 18 plus 40 is 161.
[74:05.47]Oh my god.
[74:05.89]We've got 86 plus the 17 plus the 18 plus the 90 is 211.
[74:23.76]211.
[74:24.60]Okay, we've got 86.
[74:25.47]Plus 17.
[74:26.01]Carry the 18.
[74:26.83]Add on the 40.
[74:28.25]Minus 29.
[74:28.53]You've got 132.
[74:29.05]Let's check that one.
[74:31.61]132.
[74:31.73]Incorrect.
[74:32.65]You've got 86.
[74:33.01]You've got plus fucking 17.
[74:34.11]Plus 18.
[74:34.29]Plus... What did I do?
[74:35.01]40.
[74:35.19]Minus 29.
[74:35.35]112.
[74:35.57]Incorrect code.
[74:52.97]We got 9, 8.
[74:53.33]We got 9, 8.
[74:53.59]We have 17.
[74:53.95]We have 18.
[74:54.89]We have 40.
[74:55.15]9, 8, 17.
[74:55.31]9, 8, 17, 18, 40.
[74:55.45]We got 86.
[74:55.89]I'm going to lose my mind, guys.
[74:57.31]86, 17, 18, 40.
[75:23.60]Oh my god.
[75:24.80]98171840.
[75:24.82]98171840.
[75:27.18]That's not correct.
[75:28.14]901740.
[75:28.16]901740.
[75:28.22]Just throw them out here, guys.
[75:30.60]Incorrect code.
[75:46.35]Where's the 86 coming from?
[75:47.57]86 is... 86 is coming from here.
[75:51.33]Because, by the way, you can't die in here.
[75:53.51]Because I would have been dead like 45 minutes ago.
[75:55.70]The 98 is upside... No, this is probably not even upside down.
[75:57.98]9, 8, 18, 40.
[76:06.91]Electronic lock.
[76:08.47]In this keypad, I can enter a code.
[76:11.42]Then I should be able to open the door.
[76:15.48]9-8-17-18-40.
[76:16.10]9-8... Electronic lock.
[76:18.72]In this keypad.
[76:20.88]Incorrect code.
[76:21.82]9-8-1...
[76:29.13]eight one seven forty nine eight one eight one seven forty but wait wait nine eight one eight nine eight one eight one seven forty excuse me nine eight one eight once why are we going over here I don't understand why is this one uh why is this one ahead of this one this one's in front this one's in the front
[76:57.88]Why would this one be after 18?
[77:01.17]17 comes before 18, and it's closer to here.
[77:03.55]Alright, can we, let's just go.
[77:09.69]Open up the door, Patrick.
[77:10.69]There's a guy right there.
[77:13.23]Oh, so scary.
[77:14.15]Let's go.
[77:21.83]Alright, got, got, okay, we got a gun.
[77:23.47]Did I just take pictures of myself?
[77:26.15]Where am I?
[77:27.93]I got a note.
[77:28.43]I got a teddy bear.
[77:29.27]Let's read the note.
[77:30.39]Okay, have it your way.
[77:31.97]My husband did not shoot himself in the head on his way from a drunken escapade.
[77:36.35]That evening, he stayed at home.
[77:37.62]I killed him because I was sick of his constant moaning.
[77:40.56]At least I could then sit down in front of the TV in a peace and quiet and watch a cookery show.
[77:45.50]I'm going to zoom in on this one, too.
[77:50.40]Let's see what this says.
[77:52.04]In a drunken escapade, he stayed at home.
[77:54.64]I know.
[77:55.02]I was sick of his constant least could then.
[78:01.35]Doesn't mean anything, I guess.
[78:03.59]Let's go this way, then.
[78:06.52]Does it mean anything?
[78:10.90]There was something.
[78:11.92]What do you mean, there was something?
[78:13.29]Where?
[78:19.03]A peace and quiet.
[78:19.95]Alright, what about zoom it out?
[78:21.94]No, that's fine.
[78:24.18]Bear.
[78:25.22]Zoom in and enhance.
[78:28.98]Okay, I could cut that down with a knife, so we got all kinds of evidence here.
[78:32.92]Shell casing.
[78:33.45]Gun.
[78:33.63]No gun.
[78:34.77]Uh, we got some squirrel hair.
[78:35.89]Cell phone.
[78:37.01]Got a nightstick.
[78:48.52]Ultraviolet.
[78:49.56]Sarah.
[78:50.44]Shoe.
[78:52.52]We're going to scrub the hell out of this crime scene.
[78:58.10]Got a key?
[79:00.74]I have.
[79:01.08]No, I don't.
[79:02.00]Alright, ultraviolet light.
[79:03.90]Let's start over here.
[79:08.27]Don't touch.
[79:11.93]Don't touch.
[79:13.85]Do you remember Weeb?
[79:16.56]Oh, do you remember Web?
[79:17.74]I thought he was making fun of me.
[79:19.70]Okay.
[79:21.10]Anything else we got with an ultraviolet light?
[79:22.74]Don't touch.
[79:25.96]Looks like anything else on the wall here.
[79:27.42]Oh, okay.
[79:34.32]Robert is a murderer.
[79:38.78]What about the ceiling?
[79:43.16]Nothing on the ceiling, it seems.
[79:46.47]Oh.
[79:47.07]This is a test.
[79:50.57]This is an example of speaks.
[79:52.69]An audio compression format.
[79:54.29]This is an example of speaks.
[79:57.97]Alright, this is a test.
[79:59.83]Robert is a murderer.
[80:00.75]Don't touch.
[80:03.05]What about the back wall?
[80:06.41]Plus 137.
[80:08.21]No more addition and subtraction nonsense, please.
[80:11.79]Come on.
[80:12.41]You're not gonna do this again.
[80:14.04]Plus 137.
[80:19.36]Don't start this again.
[80:20.51]I don't want to do that again.
[80:21.49]Alright, let's go ahead and just open the computer.
[80:23.87]I'm just not okay with another math portion of this.
[80:36.75]I could cut that with a knife.
[80:38.77]What about my phone?
[80:39.73]I need a key.
[80:40.49]137.
[80:40.51]The door doesn't open.
[80:42.51]So what if I clean this?
[80:43.31]I said don't touch it.
[80:44.62]What if I just touch it anyways?
[80:46.04]Is the boogeyman going to come out and attack me?
[81:05.76]I don't think so.
[81:06.40]What about that?
[81:06.86]Can I just clean that off?
[81:10.92]Is something like eyeballs in a jar?
[81:15.50]Chop my own head off with that thing?
[81:20.13]Matches?
[81:20.51]Let's let it match.
[81:21.29]Just to see what it does.
[81:22.93]Oh, wait a minute.
[81:26.21]What the fuck is that?
[81:29.49]Okay, I can switch.
[81:32.05]That was a dumbfounded accidental thing.
[81:34.68]Computer on.
[81:36.41]No signal.
[81:41.09]The screen needs calibration.
[81:43.59]How do I calibrate the screen?
[81:46.63]Menu.
[81:47.31]Oh, my... CRT 1.0 era 1988.
[81:52.34]Okay.
[81:54.96]Calibrate the screen.
[81:55.64]Vertical minus...
[82:04.16]We need a plus 173 here.
[82:04.90]So this is minus.
[82:05.52]We need to go plus 173.
[82:06.26]How far does this go?
[82:08.52]Okay.
[82:39.49]I thought it wasn't going to go more than like... I didn't think this... HD didn't exist back in 1988, guys.
[82:46.78]Don't be angry with me because I'm trying to go... The horizontal, the max horizontal resolution back in 1988 was like 160p.
[82:54.41]So, sorry.
[82:57.45]I didn't know that it'd be like 4K resolution on a fucking old CRT TV.
[83:09.02]Once we get to 19-20.
[83:11.40]No, what is it?
[83:12.14]What's the max?
[83:13.74]No, it's gonna be 999.
[83:16.30]Oh my god.
[83:17.94]I thought it was... I'm not stupid.
[83:20.38]I just didn't think that they coded into this game higher resolutions that were possible than back in the fucking 80s.
[83:26.92]Give me a break.
[83:48.11]I'll get it.
[83:48.55]Just hold on.
[83:56.68]Can't even calibrate my own screen.
[84:11.73]Try the front panel.
[84:13.29]Yeah, I'll try the front panel.
[84:14.51]I'll rip its guts out. 173.
[84:23.77]You can't give me shit for that.
[84:25.25]Was I really supposed to think there would be a bigger horizontal resolution than what is currently Ultra HD in the year 2018?
[84:31.94]Give me a little bit of a slack break here, okay?
[84:36.02]All right, we got this at 173.
[84:38.88]That's minus, though. 137.
[84:48.48]137.
[84:48.60]I don't know what the other one is.
[84:50.04]We have to find the other number.
[84:55.54]I can't pull this down.
[84:57.52]No signal.
[84:58.70]Screen needs calibration.
[84:59.68]Alright, well, I need the other number then.
[85:02.62]Somehow.
[85:06.86]137.
[85:12.90]You can play Flappy Bird on this game.
[85:14.88]What are you talking about?
[85:18.81]Oh, we got a key here.
[85:20.19]You should take it with you.
[85:21.44]Let's open this up.
[85:22.42]Probably gonna get the other resolution here.
[85:24.76]God damn it.
[85:27.08]Robert?
[85:28.56]Robert Hoke?
[85:30.00]Clark, thank God.
[85:32.23]We've had an accident.
[85:34.05]I don't know where I am and what happened to Sarah.
[85:37.13]Call the police.
[85:38.01]Sarah?
[85:38.49]Robert, I can't.
[85:40.67]I think it's the other guy doing a voice talking to himself.
[85:45.71]I'm gonna get a text message here.
[85:47.60]I'm no longer fine.
[85:48.28]Help Clark find the code.
[85:49.06]I have 15 minutes to do this.
[86:08.22]What do you have?
[86:11.34]15 minutes?
[86:11.64]Where's my text?
[86:13.68]Magnifying glass?
[86:15.92]Oh, dear.
[86:16.74]Okay.
[86:17.36]Now we've got a problem.
[86:19.06]No, I don't want to do a magnifying glass.
[86:22.84]I... This is going to end up being a number smeared somewhere.
[86:37.11]What about the bear?
[86:38.03]Well, Clark, you're gonna die.
[86:42.49]Okay, what about over here?
[86:46.21]I'm gonna have to, like, examine... What's that?
[86:50.23]I don't know.
[86:50.57]What's this?
[86:53.59]Shell casing?
[86:54.13]Web 66?
[86:54.23]6699?
[86:54.25]I think you guys are looking too far into that one.
[87:06.56]Let me pull up my magnifying glass.
[87:11.29]Let's play the hidden object game.
[87:18.21]Ow, my eyes.
[87:25.92]And also, if you hold a magnifying glass up, you need to be pretty close.
[87:29.90]You can't just hold it up like 40 feet away from an object.
[87:31.92]It would work.
[87:32.50]It's got to be one of these items here, right?
[87:42.39]It's my shoe.
[87:43.97]Shoe, phone.
[87:45.69]Somebody's glass, a gun, shell casing.
[87:48.99]Shell casing.
[87:50.57]Does it come from this gun?
[87:51.85]How can I determine?
[87:52.63]How can I determine?
[87:54.41]Is this Sora's threat of her?
[87:57.28]I hope I'm wrong.
[87:59.00]These crime scene numbers.
[88:00.44]Oh, god damn it.
[88:02.92]173.
[88:02.94]137 would be... Okay, casing, gun.
[88:11.74]hair so this is this gun's bullet and somebody with like a long hair shot someone somebody said I said there's a 98 up here what do you what do you want about 98 where is there a 98 what about text message yep uh that's true
[88:41.45]Okay.
[88:42.63]The owner of this phone just won a hundred million dollars.
[88:45.47]Send back a message.
[88:46.25]Don't be a chicken.
[88:48.99]In a room gold pillar, every now and then someone moves a jar and wood.
[88:55.07]The course of events thanks to which Robert saves Patrick's life.
[88:58.86]What if... In a room gold pillar, now and then someone moves a jar...
[89:09.46]Can I move one of these jars?
[89:11.54]And wood.
[89:17.79]Gold.
[89:19.73]Robert saves Patrick's life.
[89:22.61]Pillar jar wood Robert Patrick.
[89:27.01]Pillar jar wood Robert Patrick.
[89:31.92]Hello?
[89:35.52]Pillar jar wood Robert Patrick.
[89:40.34]Gold pillar.
[89:42.08]Jar wood.
[89:43.61]Gold pillar.
[89:45.57]Right.
[89:46.07]Jar.
[89:46.17]Wood.
[89:46.41]Pillar jar.
[89:47.13]Patrick.
[89:48.23]Pillar jar.
[89:48.71]Move wood.
[89:49.63]Piece of paper.
[89:51.75]Touch it.
[89:52.21]Sometimes it pays off to look carefully.
[90:09.08]E... E-K-R.
[90:13.82]E-R... Eek.
[90:15.68]Eek.
[90:16.14]Eek the cat.
[90:17.60]Eek the cat.
[90:18.24]How is this fun?
[90:24.23]Zoom!
[90:26.73]Alright, what do we got here, guys?
[90:27.63]What do we got?
[90:30.99]We see... I got a... Magnifying glass!
[90:35.98]Yep.
[90:36.62]Pull it out.
[90:42.30]Bring out the magnifying glass!
[90:48.90]Alright, so I just, okay, I was holding the piece of paper in front of my face, and what I decided to do, no, I got an idea!
[90:56.35]I put it across the room, stand, I stood all the way back at the other side of the room, and held up the magnifying glass to the paper.
[91:07.13]We only have nine minutes.
[91:08.11]Any more jars?
[91:08.75]Can I move any more jars?
[91:11.67]What does this mean?
[91:12.67]We have to figure this out.
[91:13.41]Sometimes it pays to look carefully.
[91:18.07]Shit.
[91:19.15]E-K-R.
[91:22.31]Oh, Patrick's gonna die.
[91:26.63]E-K-R.
[91:29.79]What does that mean?
[91:34.80]E-1-C-R?
[91:39.12]Wait, hold on.
[91:40.46]Three?
[91:43.63]Let's see.
[91:44.35]One, three.
[91:45.17]E?
[91:53.08]The numbers.
[91:53.92]The numbers.
[91:54.68]What do they mean?
[91:56.06]E-1-C-R.
[91:57.60]E-I-C-R.
[92:01.03]Alright, but what does E-1-C-R mean?
[92:03.13]Is that a code?
[92:04.27]Electronic lock in a disk.
[92:08.97]Incorrect code.
[92:11.04]Okay, I got a whole lot of it.
[92:12.02]Wait, wait, wait.
[92:12.58]Where's that text?
[92:13.64]The gold pillar.
[92:21.23]Gold pillar.
[92:22.13]You guys see anything gold in here?
[92:23.77]Looking for a gold pillar.
[92:26.81]And the wood.
[92:27.53]Something about the wood.
[92:28.35]It's going to be something on the ground.
[92:29.23]There's a piece of wood I can probably move.
[92:30.41]Broken what?
[92:32.72]Broken gun?
[92:33.12]No.
[92:33.50]Wood.
[92:33.80]Wood.
[92:39.99]This thing said, don't touch.
[92:46.52]The casing.
[92:47.16]That's what I thought too.
[92:49.46]Shit, he's dead.
[92:53.30]This is like where choice matters.
[92:55.25]Gold pillar?
[92:55.93]No.
[93:00.87]The wood is the piece of wood you already moved.
[93:02.65]All right.
[93:04.80]I need a broken glass.
[93:05.92]How do I pick it up?
[93:08.56]Pick it up with a cloth?
[93:09.44]I can't pick it up.
[93:10.10]Phone in the ground.
[93:12.10]I can't touch it.
[93:13.46]I can't pick it up.
[93:17.28]The computer case is a gold blade.
[93:20.16]I need to cut this down.
[93:21.12]I think a knife could cut it.
[93:39.28]This looks pretty suspicious, but I can't do anything about it.
[93:46.93]Seven minutes.
[93:48.57]Seven minutes is all we have.
[93:49.47]Let me look at the phone again.
[93:52.39]All right, let's go to messages.
[94:01.01]Okay, in a room, gold pillar.
[94:03.01]Every now and then, someone moves a jar in wood.
[94:05.17]And the course of events change, thanks to which Robert saves Patrick.
[94:08.81]Alright, what's the gold pillar?
[94:11.35]A different room?
[94:17.03]Weird ladders, gold pillar.
[94:18.53]What the fuck are they talking about?
[94:20.79]Should I go back to one of the other rooms?
[94:27.23]I'm so screwed.
[94:28.28]I...
[94:33.29]Gold isn't capitalized, just pillar.
[94:36.57]There's no pillar in here besides this thing.
[94:38.27]Would this even be classified as a pillar?
[94:47.78]Let's turn the computer back on.
[94:50.06]Regular pillar?
[94:51.16]Where is that?
[94:51.74]Robert's a murderer.
[95:02.80]Don't touch.
[95:04.80]Stay away.
[95:05.60]It is plus 137.
[95:06.70]This is a test.
[95:18.45]I can't magnify this.
[95:19.49]Okay, anyway, my husband died.
[95:23.71]Oh, man.
[95:26.13]Five minutes.
[95:28.11]Do you remember, Webb?
[95:29.23]Oh, my God.
[95:33.08]I don't know.
[95:34.59]I don't know what to do here.
[95:38.42]What about the red and yellow wood you keep going over with the blacklight?
[95:42.68]This thing, yeah, but I can't move it.
[95:43.92]I can't touch it or anything.
[95:45.46]I think it would be something to do with the magnifying glass, right?
[95:48.64]I haven't used this for anything.
[95:51.58]I've used it for something.
[95:53.74]What is this for?
[95:54.46]Calibrate the computer with the numbers.
[95:57.19]All I have is 137, though.
[95:59.61]Might be E1CR.
[96:00.91]Computer settings.
[96:13.87]Okay, let's try.
[96:15.51]Let's go to information first.
[96:17.91]CRT 1.0, ARM 1988C.
[96:19.21]I don't think that's going to do anything for me.
[96:24.35]Calibration.
[96:25.03]137.
[96:25.59]The other one, ER, I don't know.
[96:27.93]What would it be?
[96:30.16]3-1?
[96:35.34]It's probably for the computer, but what numbers correspond?
[96:38.06]That would be like 3-1-1.
[96:41.65]Six?
[96:42.87]What would R be?
[96:43.95]Five?
[96:44.29]I have no idea.
[96:44.91]Touch the bug.
[96:47.31]Can it even be positive?
[96:48.35]That's a good question.
[96:49.55]Let's find out.
[96:54.03]Final mod.
[96:54.64]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[96:57.28]Final mod air hack command.

[97:46.64]Wrong login or password.
[97:47.92]Oh, okay, I got it, I got it.

[97:51.98]Password is 137.
[97:54.34]Come on, what's the goddamn password?
[97:59.90]Login password, E1CR login.

[98:19.09]Wait, hold on, let me make sure about something here.
[98:22.29]Okay, no, that wasn't the correct.
[98:27.21]No, it's, I don't know either one.
[98:28.85]Robert?
[98:30.53]Robert Patrick?
[98:31.19]Patrick.
[98:34.33]Patrick.
[98:37.71]Password, E1CR.
[98:44.91]Username is Pillar.
[98:45.75]Password is WoodJarOfPatrick.
[98:51.48]Web?
[98:53.30]Wait, maybe it's web.
[98:55.54]Password, E1CR.

[99:24.11]E1CR.
[99:37.85]Is the timer still going?
[99:38.83]Oh, I hope not.
[99:39.49]Otherwise, he's dead in the next room.
[99:41.77]Where am I getting E1CR from?
[99:43.46]From that piece of paper.
[99:48.04]Admin.
[99:49.00]Password.
[99:52.50]It's good old Eric Wiebe.
[100:03.95]Admin password 1.
[100:05.03]There's not a damn 1.
[100:06.75]EKR password 137.
[100:10.83]The K is the 1C.
[100:16.30]It said to look closer.
[100:19.88]E1CR is what the look closer was.
[100:26.49]So then we got the password.
[100:32.04]E-K-R.
[100:33.12]Look, look, I don't want to lose any time here.
[100:35.60]Oh, shit.
[100:36.26]I have a, hold on.
[100:41.36]I've lost some time here.
[100:42.68]Zoom in on the screen.
[100:44.92]Could be an I. But what's the password?
[100:51.75]I instead of a one.
[100:55.95]E-I-C-R.
[100:58.61]No.
[100:59.33]Username.
[101:01.36]Web.
[101:03.12]E-I-C-R.
[101:08.04]3.26.
[101:08.36]I think I freeze time here.

[101:12.59]No, I don't.
[101:13.27]Fuck.
[101:13.65]I have three minutes.
[101:16.43]It's Eric.
[101:19.87]Eric.
[101:23.37]I only have three minutes.
[101:28.25]What's the password?
[101:29.79]137 is the only thing I can think of.
[101:36.55]Shit.
[101:38.67]It could be Eric Webb.
[101:42.97]Eric Webb.
[101:44.16]Password 137.
[101:44.84]I do freeze time if I do this.
[102:00.77]Let me think about this.
[102:04.93]It's Eric Webb.
[102:07.73]What is this idiot's password?
[102:13.32]Eric Webb.
[102:14.86]Password... I don't know.
[102:22.50]Robert's the guy's name.
[102:23.59]But who the fuck is Eric?
[102:26.91]Okay, I'm gonna look at this right now.
[102:27.93]Ready?
[102:28.17]Quick!
[102:28.79]Two minutes!
[102:31.19]See?

[102:35.51]I-I-1-C-R.
[102:36.39]Eric.
[102:37.39]Why are we getting Eric from this?
[102:38.44]I have 1 minute and 50 fucking seconds.
[102:40.16]E-I-C-1.
[102:41.12]E-1... That's a 1.
[102:42.14]That's not an I. That's not... That's an E-1-C-R.
[102:48.38]You don't... This doesn't K. That's E-1.
[102:52.21]That's an E-1.
[102:54.55]E-1-C-R.
[102:55.29]Pass.
[102:55.53]Okay.
[102:55.93]Eric.
[102:56.95]E-1-C-R.
[103:02.60]Log off.
[103:04.40]Get off.
[103:09.08]E... E1CR.
[103:13.90]That's definitely what that is.
[103:20.19]E3... There is no login.
[103:24.41]Do you remember?
[103:25.17]I don't know.
[103:25.87]What happens when this gets to zero?
[103:31.29]E-1-C-R-W-E-6-6?
[103:37.17]E-1-C-R-W-E-6-6.
[103:40.22]Come on!
[103:42.28]Robert Patrick.
[103:47.26]E-1-C-R.
[103:50.52]E-6-2-1?
[103:54.44]Numbers are on the ground, but I can't put these together.
[103:59.18]Clark's gonna die.
[104:00.26]He's gonna get his head cut off.
[104:04.96]Stop turning letters into numbers.
[104:06.28]But what are we supposed to do about this?!
[104:08.41]This is not EKR!
[104:10.75]Sometimes it pays to look carefully.
[104:13.15]See?
[104:13.41]I'm looking very carefully.
[104:19.51]We're all looking very carefully here.
[104:21.86]30 seconds.
[104:24.18]The letter K is not an I.
[104:27.33]What is this?
[104:28.47]Is this separation?
[104:31.91]E1.
[104:36.53]E1, C1.
[104:38.89]No, guys, we're not making like Star Wars droids.
[104:41.47]We're trying to figure out who the fuck Eric Webb is.
[104:49.42]Read the text and put the numbers on the ground together.
[104:56.79]Pillar, Jar, Wood, Patrick, Robert.
[105:00.57]Pillar, 1.
[105:02.57]Jar.
[105:03.21]Pillar, 1, 2.
[105:03.91]It's E1C12.
[105:08.03]Texas...
[105:27.30]Hold on.
[105:28.38]Wait, let me think about this objectively.
[105:33.64]I need to think about this objectively.
[105:40.11]Yeah, the pause stops the timer.
[105:41.97]Oh, shit.
[105:49.21]Oh, no, he's dead.
[105:51.09]I thought I was gaming.
[105:56.13]Sorry, Clark.
[105:59.20]E6... Was that him just screaming?
[106:14.67]Sorry, Eric.
[106:21.47]Let me check my fucking shitty cell phone.
[106:24.79]I have this magnifying glass that I haven't even used.
[106:36.21]Room pillar jar would Robert saves Patrick That scared the shit out of me I thought that was actually a guy coming in here.
[106:49.43]Oh Yeah, yeah Excuse me, you just killed Robert Answer the door when I got employed by the Dorset Courier I
[107:06.42]E621 is gonna work.
[107:09.40]For what?
[107:09.68]The username of the password?
[107:11.78]E621?
[107:15.20]E621 is what?
[107:17.26]Password 137.
[107:17.90]The magnifying glass has to have a use.
[107:24.52]It really does.
[107:25.21]Why else would I have it right now?
[107:35.67]What are you talking about?
[107:36.83]I don't understand.
[107:44.46]Give me a fucking break.
[107:47.14]Give me a fucking break.
[107:48.85]You guys, seriously.
[107:55.53]E1CR.
[107:56.45]I have such a bad headache.
[108:07.71]Oh, whatever.
[108:09.71]Whatever, I'll fucking deal with it.
[108:10.89]Give me the- I'm gonna just magnify every inch of this room.
[108:13.79]That looks like wood, doesn't it?
[108:15.11]Oh, I swear to god, like, fluids coming out of my nose.
[108:25.81]I did not- What about the eye?
[108:28.93]Can I do anything with any of this shit?
[108:31.53]What's the purpose of the magnifying glass?
[108:33.26]It doesn't make any sense.
[108:36.73]I don't have a knife.
[108:39.15]I wish I did.
[108:39.77]I would cut the bear down.
[108:47.39]There's gotta be something to look at here with this on.
[108:58.21]Magnify the phone.
[109:01.61]Oh, there's nothing there.
[109:02.83]What does the camera even do?
[109:06.39]That's, like, nothing.
[109:07.93]Doesn't seem to do anything.
[109:14.72]You guys... Oh, what the fuck?
[109:19.02]Magnification of the door?
[109:20.43]No, we tried this before.
[109:21.77]Do you remember...
[109:24.93]Keypad.
[109:25.47]162.
[109:25.51]Burn the wood.
[109:26.75]Oh, whatever.
[109:27.43]By the way, like, how can it be quiet here?
[109:51.47]Is this Sarah's strand of hair?
[109:54.23]I hope I'm wrong.
[110:01.11]It's just the same glass shell casing.
[110:06.57]Does it come from this gun?
[110:10.41]It reminds me of a cord, but I cannot tear it.
[110:14.74]I think a knife could cut it.
[110:18.00]God damn it.
[110:20.27]And what the hell does this even mean?
[110:21.61]Don't touch.
[110:24.87]Am I missing one of these?
[110:25.99]Do I not find one of them?
[110:29.17]There's gotta be one more hanging out somewhere.
[110:38.08]Yeah, Robert is a murderer, okay.
[110:40.88]This is a test.
[110:43.54]Here, plus 137.
[110:44.46]That's the one number we have to go by.
[110:52.24]You touched the chest, so now Robert's dead.
[110:59.36]Maybe I have to go back to the other room.
[111:09.66]Web E1CR137.
[111:12.86]I just wish it would even tell me...
[111:22.27]E1CR password 126 1264 no use Robert password Patrick play it on easy tips yes always show objectives
[111:53.42]I can't.
[111:54.80]We did the regular mode.
[111:59.00]Show laptop battery.
[112:00.18]What the hell are you talking about?
[112:03.90]Blacklight on the keypad.
[112:05.18]I wish.
[112:07.89]I wish that were a thing I could do.
[112:11.25]This did have tips.
[112:12.39]We decided to go against having any tips.
[112:17.27]You guys are the tips.
[112:22.78]This is the number one and two put together.
[112:30.54]Administrator and EKR.
[112:32.57]I'll try administrator.
[112:36.99]Administrator and EKR.
[112:41.79]No.
[112:44.17]Why would you rely on us?
[112:45.41]Because we're playing this game together.
[112:46.95]We have to get through this game together.
[112:52.00]Blacklight the note, I can't.
[112:54.82]It's E1CR.
[113:04.88]Let me in.
[113:07.74]Please just let me in.
[113:12.31]Blacklight the notes is a great idea.
[113:13.75]I wish it worked.
[113:15.99]I can't, I have to, see.
[113:20.05]Sometimes it pays off to look carefully.
[113:23.65]Unless there's something else completely that's missing here.
[113:30.16]It's not a situation like this, right?
[113:35.80]F1... Like, C, R, or something.
[113:39.68]It's not one of those dumb situations.
[113:50.43]Is it E1C12?
[113:53.62]Might be.
[113:55.92]That's true.
[113:56.34]Let's try that.
[113:58.20]But what?
[113:58.54]Web?
[113:58.62]E1C12.
[113:58.68]Oh, come on.

[114:57.65]I actually tried doing this.
[115:00.33]Didn't do anything.
[115:03.15]This said don't touch.
[115:04.29]So you think I could clean it up and... No.
[115:08.09]Doesn't do anything.
[115:11.13]Nothing does anything apparently.
[115:17.84]I want to get to the part where I have to talk into the microphone.
[115:20.56]That's why I have this game.
[115:22.90]I only bought this game because there's a part coming up where you actually have to talk into the mic.
[115:31.42]Clean the floor.
[115:32.78]Clean the door.
[115:34.18]Clean the windows.
[115:35.76]Clean this door.
[115:38.86]Neat the shoe.
[115:39.66]Shave.
[115:39.94]Put your shoe on the head or you suck.
[115:43.20]How's that one go?
[115:44.70]What if we flip this?
[115:45.82]That doesn't do anything.
[116:04.16]Could the password be... I wish I knew.
[116:08.25]Let's, you know, I'm gonna go back.
[116:10.17]Let's just go out of here for a second.
[116:15.01]Clean the wall near the pillar.
[116:16.93]Hold on.
[116:17.63]Let's take a second here.
[116:20.20]Just in case there's something else.
[116:22.00]There's not.
[116:22.80]Don't worry.
[116:23.54]Blacklight the blood.
[116:25.96]We already did that.
[116:35.65]See, look, ready?
[116:37.85]Don't touch.
[116:39.83]But don't touch what?
[116:41.69]This, I guess?
[116:45.62]This is don't touch, and then it says, this is a test.
[116:48.50]And then here's a 137, and also, you're a murderer, Robert.
[116:54.63]What else we got here?
[116:56.21]Nothing else.
[117:00.85]Nothing else.
[117:02.95]Too many password attempts.
[117:05.05]Let's try to clean this wall here.
[117:06.49]Nothing.
[117:10.23]Oh, come on.
[117:13.12]Give me a fucking break.
[117:15.28]What is that?
[117:15.62]I need the magnifying glass.
[117:18.42]That's plus 10.
[117:20.74]No more pluses and minuses.
[117:22.52]Come on, man.
[117:23.18]Plus 10.
[117:23.40]Plus 137.
[117:23.78]Oh, my God.
[117:33.79]Plus 10.
[117:35.31]What is this?
[117:35.67]There's something else under there too.
[117:38.83]No, just plus 10.
[117:43.30]Plus 10 plus 137.
[117:44.54]Achieve a maximum headache.
[117:53.32]I'm gonna use the blacklight in the other room.
[118:02.57]Pull it out.
[118:03.57]Anything in these rooms.
[118:06.41]This might be one of those games where you have to backtrack and examine everything.
[118:11.04]Just examine it all.
[118:13.56]It could be somebody pissed a number into the wall with their blood piss.
[118:21.02]Well, the cool thing is I don't even need the lighter anymore.
[118:24.01]Nothing.
[118:25.77]Nothing.
[118:27.99]Nothing.
[118:31.11]No, I don't think they would put any shit back here at all.
[118:36.68]No, no way.
[118:39.92]No, I got the second number.
[118:42.26]That's what I needed.
[118:42.86]There might be another one.
[118:47.19]And then, what the hell does that mean?
[118:52.21]What on earth is that supposed to mean?
[118:54.17]137 plus 10.
[118:55.11]Let me see the cleaner.
[119:00.79]None of these... This can't be cleaned.
[119:04.06]Just that.
[119:04.96]Anything else?
[119:05.42]Can anything else be cleaned?
[119:06.54]I think that's it.
[119:07.94]Maybe over here?
[119:08.42]No.
[119:08.60]Dirty over here.
[119:10.30]I think that's all I need.
[119:11.16]EKR 137.
[119:11.36]Killer is plus 10.
[119:31.50]Jar is E-C... Okay, that's Jar.
[119:38.51]This is too dirty.
[119:39.29]This stream is exhausting.
[119:40.57]I know, it is.
[119:41.33]I am, like, exhausted by this, but I need to see what's in the other door.
[119:47.90]I'm gonna say...
[119:55.60]13710 on the door.
[119:56.80]Let's try it.
[120:00.25]It's nothing to do with the login.
[120:03.03]It's just a convoluted fucking mess.
[120:14.45]Relaxing Exhausting Horror.
[120:16.37]That's a good title.
[120:17.47]I want to change this.
[120:18.09]Hey, one of the mods changed that.
[120:20.15]Change it to Relaxing Exhausting Horror Game.
[120:26.02]So that would be 147, right?
[120:31.26]So what is 10?
[120:31.68]There's no 1 and 0.
[120:33.66]The 0 doesn't exist.
[120:34.56]E1CR147.
[120:36.57]But who is the username?
[120:53.16]E1CR 147.
[120:53.94]God damn it.
[121:04.47]137 and plus 10 seem like the offsets.
[121:06.21]Past is probably EKRE1 EICR.
[121:10.27]Maybe it is Eric.
[121:13.27]Stop the E1CR.
[121:16.20]Magnify the note.
[121:17.20]You cannot... That just scared me, but you can't use any of your items while you're looking at something.
[121:25.41]I wish you could.
[121:28.57]Try to do another calibration.
[121:30.01]You know, that's not a bad idea.
[121:33.74]What happens if we just push it around?
[121:37.04]Maybe if I go this way and down, maybe it can pull something else up.
[121:41.56]Probably not, but you know, it's worth a shot.
[121:50.59]Do my pin.
[121:52.75]No, this is not gonna work.
[121:53.73]It needs to be 0, 0.
[121:56.01]I'm just gonna push it off the screen is what I'm gonna do.
[122:02.19]Can't go above 0, 0.
[122:03.51]No, it just has to be calibrated.
[122:10.10]137 and plus 10.
[122:10.94]You can't go positive.
[122:11.88]You can only go negative.
[122:14.74]What if I try to call the police?
[122:15.52]I'm just gonna call the police.
[122:18.50]I'm calling the police.
[122:22.36]Just give me the phone.
[122:30.91]Incoming call.
[122:31.43]Come on.
[122:31.73]Magnify the note when it's not selected.
[122:33.59]Notepad.
[122:34.57]Nothing else.
[122:50.40]The board guy can't... 1-1-2 is the UK.
[122:56.74]No, it doesn't say.
[122:57.72]I mean... From back here, that looks like an A. Like A-1-1-C.
[123:04.70]That can't be right, though.
[123:05.80]It can't be.
[123:13.24]And there's no walkthrough for this game.
[123:15.01]The game came out, like, earlier today.

[128:53.86]A6.
[128:57.02]Tell me the answers on the Steam page.
[129:00.94]Read the text on the monitor.
[129:03.12]Only the administrator can log into the system.
[129:05.49]Alright.
[129:06.83]Part 1 complete.
[129:10.17]Admin.
[129:11.59]A6 C16
[129:19.59]Administrator.
[129:20.73]A6160... A6C116... What is it?
[129:25.40]A6C16... A6C16.
[129:26.72]Oh my god.
[129:27.54]Am I spelling it right?
[129:28.08]Admin.
[129:29.88]A6C16C6...
[129:58.66]It's probably different every run.
[130:01.50]And you know what?
[130:02.10]I would not be surprised.
[130:06.47]Only the administrator can log in.
[130:08.85]A6CC61C... You guys are just fucking with me now.
[130:12.77]At least we know the user.
[130:15.67]The question is, does this change?
[130:18.81]It's a test.
[130:24.49]Password's on the bear, but I need a knife.
[130:29.43]137.
[130:29.47]Let's see.
[130:30.63]Hold on.
[130:32.25]Let me see if this works.
[130:34.57]I'm not giving up on this today.
[130:35.75]I need to know this.
[130:37.13]Plus 10.
[130:37.61]It's the same.
[130:41.53]Try guest.
[130:46.67]So very clearly, this stays the same.
[130:50.69]We're not going to open this until we're ready.
[130:52.60]So what's in there?
[130:55.28]The magnifying glass is in there.
[131:02.18]Oh my fucking god, is he still playing this?
[131:05.23]Yes, because I refuse to be beaten.
[131:11.69]I need to go look at the screenshots on the Steam page.
[131:14.17]Okay.
[131:17.00]Alright, let's go to the Steam page.
[131:19.66]Visit store page.
[131:23.94]So you're telling me that in the screenshots here that I get an answer.
[131:33.46]This, okay, wait, wait, wait, there it is!
[131:37.44]It actually is in the Steam screenshot.
[131:43.01]I need to zoom in on this one.
[131:46.43]Okay.
[131:48.61]Username admin, password A6C16.
[131:55.51]Admin A6C16.
[131:56.63]Okay.
[132:02.13]Admin A... What is it?
[132:08.44]A6C16.
[132:12.54]Oh, come on.
[132:19.42]Even the cheat on the Steam page doesn't work.
[132:21.73]But at least I know it's Admin.
[132:30.23]Admin E, what was it?
[132:31.61]Admin E?
[132:33.56]Admin E1CR.
[132:35.72]Admin E1CR147.
[132:37.30]Give me a break.
[132:39.46]Admin EICR147.
[133:02.47]you guys are just watching me on my computer streaming a game where I'm trying to break into somebody else's computer on the stream e1c12 admin e1c12 oh my god no way because okay if a6c16 e1c12
[133:35.94]Just use the security questions.
[133:39.76]Find a way to cut the bear.
[133:41.42]I need a knife.
[133:44.72]E1C... Okay, it's going to get to a point where I'm going to have to cut the cord on this one.
[133:55.13]That would make so much sense.
[133:56.97]If the screenshot password from the game's store page is A6C16, we have to be getting close.
[134:07.36]We have to be.
[134:10.54]Right?
[134:12.30]We have to be getting close.
[134:15.99]Oh, shit.
[134:16.69]Now I got 15 minutes.
[134:17.23]Oh, my goddammit.
[134:39.30]Hey, maybe it's... Maybe it's E1C122025.
[134:40.88]I need to reopen the fucking game.
[134:42.18]Give me a second.
[135:10.23]Okay.
[135:12.95]Just wait.
[135:15.85]Just hold on a second.
[135:17.19]Everyone just chill.
[135:18.73]Just stay where you are.
[135:19.74]Nobody move.
[135:23.98]Nice background.
[135:26.92]It is a nice background.
[135:29.80]All right.
[135:31.02]I'm going to look.
[135:31.46]I want to look at something here.
[135:32.52]Let's go to discussions.
[135:38.65]Fucking God.
[135:42.03]Well, I got the bug this guy got.
[135:47.16]No, there's no... There's no... This gave us three reviews.
[135:53.00]Wait a minute!
[135:59.31]This guy's got gameplay.
[136:02.39]We got gameplay.
[136:03.69]Let's see.
[136:06.98]Oh, come on.
[136:07.70]Does he get through?
[136:08.56]What room is he in?
[136:10.19]No, he just beats- he just does the first room.
[136:11.93]Come on, we gotta wait til- okay, we have to wait til this guy.
[136:15.95]There's a guy on YouTube doing a playthrough, we have to wait til he makes another video.
[136:22.52]There's a knife in the other room.
[136:28.85]Yeah, he's doing like episodes.
[136:32.65]So, when did he- when did this episode release?
[136:37.37]Like two hours ago?
[136:38.57]That means episode two... Episode two has to be coming out soon.
[136:47.86]Show his gameplay.
[136:49.04]No.
[136:51.42]Is this game relevant to you?
[136:52.50]I own it.
[136:53.14]Okay.
[136:54.12]We're going to do it again.
[136:55.32]We're going to go and we're going to look for a knife.
[136:59.14]I honestly can't believe I'm still playing this game.
[137:01.94]But sometimes you get locked in.
[137:03.46]And we are locked in.
[137:05.82]Until something happens...
[137:08.29]Look, this is just supposed to be a relaxing day.
[137:10.62]We just relax.
[137:13.02]We're just playing a game.
[137:13.76]We're just gonna relax.
[137:16.72]So nobody, nobody worry about it.
[137:18.40]We're just, this is a relaxing stream.
[137:22.87]Let's move back over here.
[137:23.91]I mean, like, it is, like, fucking exhausting.
[137:31.75]But we're, like, we're kind of, like, we're having a good relaxation day today.
[137:40.65]Yeah, see, better experience, wear headphones with a microphone.
[137:43.27]All I've been able to do is hold my breath while I hold a fucking match in my hand.
[137:48.81]Okay, start the game, continue the game.
[137:51.69]Here we go.
[137:53.42]I have to be committed.
[137:55.78]Let's go back.
[137:56.76]Let's go into this room.
[137:57.62]Let's make it easy.
[137:58.88]No, just everybody, don't make fun of me.
[138:01.34]I'm not gonna make fun of you, don't make fun of me.
[138:04.50]What's the golden rule?
[138:05.73]Treat others the way you'd like to be treated.
[138:07.57]You understand?
[138:09.62]Move this.
[138:10.38]Take the note.
[138:11.78]Eric.
[138:12.76]Eric is fine.
[138:13.68]Move to box.
[138:14.72]Move to box.
[138:15.86]There it is.
[138:16.22]Got the key.
[138:17.40]We're fine.
[138:19.58]I need a knife.
[138:22.92]Ultraviolet light.
[138:24.30]Can't do anything with this thing.
[138:27.81]Web.
[138:28.53]It's still, I believe, 137.
[138:29.57]My game is just 137, it seems.
[138:30.85]I need the cloth.
[138:38.31]Just wipe away Australia.
[138:40.77]Plus 10.
[138:44.35]Try the key on the bear.
[138:45.65]How can I use it?
[138:46.80]It reminds me of a cord.
[138:49.26]I cannot tear it.
[138:50.82]I think a knife could cut it.
[138:52.10]Can't make any phone calls.
[138:55.60]Haha, this streamer is funny.
[138:57.66]We are not going for comedy right now.
[138:59.06]I'm going for game completion.
[139:00.52]So, there's no, I'm not being funny.
[139:03.08]I have not tried to attempt to say jokes.
[139:05.34]This is a not funny relaxation exhausting stream.
[139:08.73]So, just relax.
[139:09.87]Everyone relaxes.
[139:10.63]Nope, we're not going to make any fucking jokes or anything.
[139:14.91]I'm on a joke vacation.
[139:20.23]Alright, so we have two... I think we... Honestly, I'm gonna give you some thoughts here.
[139:24.33]We have two separate things going on.
[139:26.37]We have the door key, the door password, and then our computer password.
[139:31.33]Let's not confuse the two.
[139:34.07]The numbers here are probably the code for this keypad.
[139:39.14]So with my detective deduction skills, I'm gonna say...
[139:44.67]that we just need to focus on this note and the computer.
[139:56.48]Turn the computer on.
[140:01.66]A6C63.
[140:02.64]Let's calibrate.
[140:06.62]Turn it on.
[140:07.82]Calibrate the screen.
[140:12.02]Calibration.
[140:12.56]Bring it down.
[140:17.86]The books on the shelf do anything.
[140:19.00]I believe they do not.
[140:21.04]Only the administrator can come in.
[140:22.52]Okay.
[140:25.68]We're good.
[140:27.06]So.
[140:31.67]Pillar, Jar, Wood, Robert, Patrick.
[140:35.81]We have not used the magnifying glass for anything besides this.
[140:38.55]And honestly, why would you even need it?
[140:40.05]Because it's plus ten.
[140:40.84]It's easy to see it.
[140:43.98]Numbers on the cards.
[140:45.80]This could be reality, yes.
[140:50.60]This is not the same computer from the screenshot.
[140:52.28]No, that one don't work.
[141:04.18]Still not trying to cut down the bear.
[141:05.64]I can't, I need this broken glass, but I can't pick it up.
[141:11.86]All right, let's go ahead and start the timer.
[141:18.13]there's the magnifying glass yep patrick oh god damn it I can't if I try to skip this phone call the game crashes so we can't skip the phone call thank you good to know bring it back god damn it man we were just we were really we were
[141:56.67]Just finished Last Light.
[141:59.24]I haven't even... I've barely started Last Light.
[142:02.24]It's gonna take like 12 hours to finish.
[142:05.20]You make it sound like I'm in the last chapter of Last Light.
[142:07.64]I mean like the tutorials are.
[142:10.94]We're beating this game.
[142:11.80]No, don't say that.
[142:12.52]We're gonna get through the next door out of sheer will for all of us.
[142:19.37]There's 2,600 people here.
[142:21.41]If you're telling me that we can't collect our brains...
[142:24.94]And almost 3,000 people can't figure out how to beat play with me.
[142:29.86]Combined 2,600 effort, brain.
[142:32.60]That's 2,600 brains all pouring through the internet.
[142:35.06]The power of online to solve the riddles.
[142:40.33]Somebody just gave me $50.
[142:41.31]Oh my god.
[142:43.57]The great Lord Walden, thank you for the $50.
[142:46.57]We want more of Aquaman's crotch.
[142:51.70]Well, thank you.
[142:52.84]First of all, thank you for your brain power.
[142:54.44]I can feel it.
[142:55.02]Thank you, Lord Gaben.
[142:56.28]I mean, Lord Gaben.
[142:59.10]Lord Walden, thank you for the 50 bucks.
[143:03.37]All right.
[143:03.89]Don't skip the cutscene.
[143:07.53]Eric, thank you so much, though.
[143:10.23]Walden, appreciate that, man.
[143:11.65]$50.
[143:11.69]Thank you so much.
[143:12.91]I will get to the other bits.
[143:14.49]Just not right this second.
[143:16.73]We're going to focus.
[143:22.08]Lord Walter Gabe N. Frey.
[143:25.06]Don't skip this.
[143:26.86]Just listen.
[143:27.38]It's boring and dumb and the guy sounds... Robert?
[143:30.28]Robert Hoke?
[143:31.32]Clark, thank God.
[143:33.56]We've had an accident.
[143:35.41]I don't know where I am and what happened to Sarah.
[143:38.49]Call the police.
[143:39.29]Robert, I can't.
[143:41.76]Don't cry.
[143:43.06]The game is really loud now.
[143:44.36]I'll turn it down, I'm sorry.
[143:46.48]Okay, slowly bring your hand down.
[144:16.55]What do I do about this?
[144:19.73]I think the game actually is, I cannot progress.
[144:28.41]There is no progression here.
[144:32.29]So here's what we're going to do.
[144:36.21]I'm going to restart the game completely.
[144:42.71]The crash joke was funny, but I'm doing it on purpose.
[144:45.23]How am I doing this on purpose?
[144:48.33]You think I'm crashing the game on purpose?
[145:02.43]New game.
[145:05.01]Normal.
[145:06.79]Easy.
[145:09.81]Fast.
[145:10.97]Are you guys ready?
[145:11.37]I'm going to go as fast as I fucking can.
[145:14.76]On 12th December 1999, investigative journalist Robert Hoke and his wife went out to celebrate his birthday.
[145:24.38]Skip the scene.
[145:27.07]Yep, I got dragged in, whatever, doesn't matter.
[145:31.01]We're on easy, I know exactly what I'm doing.
[145:34.09]Robert woke up in a dark room.
[145:38.88]Now, let's just remember what to do here.
[145:42.34]First of all, let me drop the volume, guys, because apparently it's outrageous.
[145:46.92]I think I had an accident.
[145:49.06]Skip this whole thing and get hints.
[145:53.98]Okay.
[145:55.00]Pull it up.
[145:56.56]Where's the switch?
[145:57.22]It's in the valve.
[146:03.87]This is my last opportunity.
[146:04.99]I don't remember what these codes were.
[146:06.55]Fuck me.
[146:08.99]I don't remember these codes.
[146:10.27]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[146:14.78]I don't remember the codes.
[146:15.74]There's like five codes.
[146:17.98]We have to free play the game.
[146:23.63]God damn it.
[146:24.47]Kevin McCloud, save us.
[146:25.85]2-2.
[146:33.24]No, shit.
[146:34.50]What is the verb?
[146:38.08]Can I open the door?
[146:40.00]Oh, look.
[146:41.54]It's blinking.
[146:43.80]Okay, we're gonna be fine.
[146:46.42]There it is.
[146:48.09]Alright, it is 14360.
[146:50.31]Get me out.
[146:53.13]Get the key.
[146:55.05]Scrub?
[146:55.73]No, I don't have a scrub yet.
[146:57.07]Open that chest.
[146:57.71]Okay.
[146:58.83]Water bottle.
[147:00.39]Matches.
[147:02.35]Phone.
[147:02.83]I need the scribbler.
[147:05.99]It just blinks on everything.
[147:06.97]This is perfect.
[147:08.39]Turn the file.
[147:08.95]Give me the cloth.
[147:14.80]It's off.
[147:16.20]Wipe this down.
[147:16.76]And it is different every time.
[147:18.42]That's 7680.
[147:18.70]Okay.
[147:26.77]No, that don't work.
[147:27.33]What's that for?
[147:28.33]7-6.
[147:28.41]Take the matches out.
[147:34.50]Turn it.
[147:45.07]Turn it!
[147:50.91]Okay, get the phone up.
[147:53.11]Unlock the phone.
[147:53.63]That's the code for the phone.
[147:54.37]7-6-8-0.
[147:57.12]Enter the pin.
[147:58.98]Seven.
[147:59.30]Got it.
[148:00.50]Phone.
[148:00.64]Menu.
[148:00.80]112.
[148:01.42]Call.
[148:01.54]Break it up.
[148:01.84]Can't do it.
[148:02.38]Sorry.
[148:02.60]Not.
[148:02.70]Go, go, go, go, go.
[148:03.42]Okay.
[148:03.56]We got a notepad.
[148:04.30]You make notes here.
[148:05.08]This code may be useful to you.
[148:06.48]7845.
[148:06.50]Do not delete the note.
[148:07.26]7845.
[148:07.92]You got it.
[148:28.73]Go.
[148:31.25]Scary guy?
[148:31.95]Oh no, look out for the 2D scary guy.
[148:33.56]Go.
[148:37.26]Four bars is bad reception.
[148:38.40]That doesn't make any sense.
[148:39.06]You're right.
[148:39.50]Okay, move this.
[148:40.52]It's different every time.
[148:42.32]So, that's fine.
[148:45.26]We don't have our funny ringtone.
[148:50.42]Don't care.
[148:51.20]And we can skip.
[148:51.96]And look, I can do this too.
[148:53.76]I can have hints.
[148:55.42]Perfect.
[148:57.55]All right, so we need to light the shit on fire.
[149:00.85]We'll be in the next room in no time.
[149:05.51]Light it up.
[149:08.76]Now that'll melt.
[149:09.24]We got 21 plus 64.
[149:12.00]We're already, we're like two hours into the game than we were last time.
[149:28.33]Mm-hmm.

[149:41.70]2-6.
[149:58.62]God damn it.
[149:59.36]Incorrect code.
[150:00.30]21642926.
[150:00.84]That's what I just did, right?
[150:03.15]Electronic lock.
[150:04.73]In this keypad, I can enter a code.
[150:08.07]Then I should be able to... Got it.
[150:10.17]Go.
[150:11.31]And it's that easy.
[150:12.99]It's that easy.
[150:13.91]We're back.
[150:19.64]Alright, I feel better now.

[152:30.75]89 and then 880.
[152:31.03]89, 880.
[152:31.07]Read the text.

[153:28.79]Admin.

[153:35.09]Which would be A1 3C 89 880.
[153:35.93]You dumb son of a bitch.
[153:38.74]Admin.
[153:39.06]Admin.
[153:39.46]A1 3C 8... 9...
[154:00.38]A1... 13... 13... 89880.
[154:00.48]13... 13... 89880.
[154:00.56]Oh, shit.

[155:03.70]Oh, it's 969.
[155:05.00]Admin.
[155:07.00]A13C.
[155:08.14]969.
[155:09.90]How?
[155:12.32]How?
[155:15.49]How?
[155:17.73]How?
[155:24.35]Move this back?
[155:26.33]No, I think this just means I can continue to move it.
[155:31.49]A13C89880.
[155:32.35]Yeah, I've tried the code on the door, but... Go back to ice removal.
[155:40.52]I can't move the picket.
[155:44.58]A13C.
[155:45.08]I mean, we've tried this before.
[155:51.98]Where's my hints?
[155:55.32]Give me the hints.
[155:56.30]Where are they?
[156:00.12]There was a question mark up here.
[156:05.93]Destroy ABC.
[156:07.59]It's definitely not ABC.
[156:11.05]This has got to be a random knife or something.
[156:12.75]Can I just click and drag?
[156:15.09]I'm going to have to click and drag.
[156:23.08]That just says A11C.
[156:23.90]Nothing else.
[156:41.05]It has to be something like this.
[156:42.71]It has to be.
[156:53.51]It has to be admin.
[157:04.15]This is just a scam.
[157:05.51]Okay, hold on.
[157:08.33]There's nothing up there.
[157:14.91]Unfortunately.
[157:18.10]Have you tried getting the knife next to the pig head?
[157:20.40]Alright, I'm going to do this one more time.
[157:22.00]Just so we're all aware.
[157:25.62]I'm going to go back to the pig.
[157:27.52]I'm going to make sure you... Look, you can't... The pig is untouchable.
[157:33.36]That's the door behind him.
[157:35.26]I can move the door.
[157:37.02]I can't move the pig.
[157:39.28]As much as I would love to.
[157:51.07]Has the guy uploaded the second second YouTube episode?
[157:55.23]God, I'm gonna laugh so hard if he gets there before I do.
[157:57.91]I have ten minutes before he dies.
[158:00.31]Camera doesn't do anything.
[158:03.16]This chest is empty.
[158:04.80]It can't move the desk or anything.
[158:06.76]The door can't be moved.
[158:11.21]I interviewed a controversial doctor for the paper.
[158:15.67]After the interview... It reminds me
[158:29.51]It reminds me of a cord, but I cannot tear it.
[158:33.72]Well, OK.
[158:34.86]See, if I got hints on, wouldn't one of these things be blinking?
[158:40.02]I think a knife could cut it.
[158:43.36]Right?
[158:43.70]Wouldn't something in the ceiling be blinking?
[158:46.76]I have the help.
[158:47.32]I have hints on.
[158:49.44]Nearly OK.
[158:50.54]Nearly OK.
[158:56.01]I got nothing else blinking.
[159:00.81]I can't burn the rope either.
[159:02.05]I need a knife.
[159:05.03]Just backtrack and look for blinkers.
[159:11.99]Go back to the first room.
[159:12.91]That's true.
[159:18.37]We're just looking for blinkers right now.
[159:20.09]That's it.
[159:20.93]First room.
[159:24.91]Burn the rope with the magnifying glass.
[159:29.22]Alright, we got anything blinking in here?
[159:32.98]Any knives?
[159:35.86]Nothing?
[159:37.26]I don't think so.
[159:48.57]What?
[159:52.31]You can move shit around.
[159:53.37]You can zoom in.
[159:54.69]I don't think that does anything, though.
[160:03.28]Well, I don't think anything happens here.
[160:06.82]I can do this.
[160:08.50]What the fuck does this even do?
[160:16.22]I think we might just be completely stuck.
[160:22.29]The crank doesn't seem to do anything either.
[160:28.43]It's nearly open.
[160:33.24]You can't burn the pig head.
[160:36.09]Everybody's on about the pig head.
[160:41.89]The pig head you get.
[160:43.19]We have seven minutes before I'm done with the game.
[160:45.87]So we better figure it out in seven fucking minutes.
[160:53.12]This is clearly A13C.
[161:03.77]The format is blank the... One sec... We'll get it, we'll get it.
[161:13.01]We have seven minutes of guessing to do.
[161:15.02]A?
[161:15.06]13C89880.
[161:18.94]What if it's an I?
[161:23.22]It's probably an I, one I.
[161:33.13]It can't be an I3C969.
[161:48.87]We tried the A13C88.
[161:50.53]I am... Maybe the game is bugged.
[161:58.07]Plus doesn't mean addition, it means order.
[162:03.33]So that's 89.
[162:05.89]They both have a plus in front of them.
[162:08.41]So that's plus 880, and this is plus 89.
[162:12.85]So which one would go first then?
[162:19.12]One and three are the numbers.
[162:20.14]See, this is a don't touch.
[162:21.22]None of this matters.
[162:23.62]I still need a knife.
[162:25.90]Roberts or murderer, this is a test.
[162:30.03]Try it on the door.
[162:30.73]1, 3, 8, 8.
[162:30.82]No.
[162:30.88]See, that's the thing.
[162:31.40]One is for the door.
[162:31.92]One's for the password.
[162:32.86]One's for the password for the door.
[162:33.80]One is the computer.
[162:35.40]It's an L, not an I. ALC.
[162:36.34]AL3C.
[163:03.47]God damn it.
[163:07.67]The number is ABC plus middle wall number plus pillar number.
[163:13.13]So, you're talking about ABC 880 89.
[163:18.04]Is 13 the first number to go with the others?
[163:23.64]The A on the note is 17.
[163:31.16]If your password was ABC, you would be a fucking moron.
[163:41.23]Is he still seriously playing this game?
[163:46.29]Alright, maybe this is like... It has to be, like, order.
[163:50.06]Look, I only have five minutes until I'm done playing the game.
[163:55.14]Messages.
[163:56.54]What the fuck is this?
[163:57.32]Horoscope?
[164:00.50]Oh, great.
[164:00.90]Thanks.
[164:04.68]Do not hang up on me until I let you do so.
[164:06.82]Remember, your life is in my hands.
[164:10.50]And a room go- Okay, pillar.
[164:13.08]Pillar jar.
[164:14.12]So, hold on.
[164:14.66]Wait!
[164:14.90]Wait a minute!
[164:17.19]89.
[164:19.25]Wait a minute!
[164:20.89]Wait a- I got it.
[164:22.99]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[164:25.03]This is- 89 is first. 89.
[164:30.96]89.
[164:31.00]89A13C.
[164:31.08]89A13C.
[164:31.20]Then what?
[164:34.16]Get out of my way.
[164:35.04]89A13C880.
[165:00.47]Oh, no.
[165:01.07]89A13C880.
[165:10.91]Oh, no.
[165:11.13]89.
[165:11.17]89A13C.
[165:11.35]It's not case sensitive.
[165:33.55]89, oh my god, I can't fucking believe this.
[165:37.21]89, 13, 880.
[165:37.79]The user is web, but it said admin.
[165:51.14]89, A, 13, C, 880.
[165:56.73]I can't, the eyeball jar is not openable.
[166:00.27]Clark's about to die, and so is this game.
[166:07.32]It was pillar, jar, right?
[166:10.92]Jar, wood.
[166:12.50]But what do you mean wood?
[166:15.32]There's nothing down here in the wood.
[166:18.31]Doesn't make any sense.
[166:18.93]And then Robert Patrick.
[166:22.35]My phone's gonna die.
[166:26.41]Okay.
[166:27.39]Pillar, jar, wood.
[166:34.87]Robert saves Patrick's life.
[166:41.90]The clue is the numbers on the floor, but how would you even... Magnifying glass on the... doesn't do anything.
[166:54.73]Is there a number in the wood?
[166:57.51]Down here somewhere.
[167:09.92]You can't pick up the glass either.
[167:11.74]I can't pick it up with the... I can't do anything with this.
[167:17.00]Well, we've got two minutes until this guy's dead.
[167:21.34]Do you remember... Wait, is it like Patrick Webb?
[167:24.82]Robert Webb?
[167:25.48]I mean, you can move this, but it doesn't... The computer switch is back here.
[167:34.13]These floor numbers mean something, but what the fuck do they even mean?
[167:41.51]Wood in the corner.
[167:44.85]I've just about had it.
[167:46.27]I've just about had it with this.
[167:53.67]I can't, the blood can't be cleaned.
[167:55.48]I tried.
[167:55.84]A six.
[168:03.78]Six is the wood.
[168:10.13]But, yes.
[168:12.23]No, six is the photo.
[168:13.91]Wait, what is the box?
[168:14.61]So, but I have the magnifying glass.
[168:16.95]A6C89.
[168:17.15]Let's try it.
[168:18.51]No, it doesn't work.
[168:40.75]We have 1 minute and 15 seconds before I'm done.
[168:50.03]I don't see the knife.
[168:51.21]Where's the knife?
[168:51.79]What are you talking about?
[168:52.65]Where's the knife?
[168:53.91]I don't believe you.
[168:55.29]A89A13C Wood Robert Patrick.
[169:02.36]Don't give me the Steam page answer.
[169:04.02]The Steam page answer doesn't work.
[169:05.44]This guy's dead in 45 seconds.
[169:15.46]I would say it was A13C89.
[169:16.82]But that's just me.
[169:27.72]WE66.
[169:34.51]Numbers for the keypad and not the answer.
[169:36.79]But where the hell is the answer for this?
[169:41.53]Wood is the door.
[169:44.63]Well, he's going to die.
[169:45.97]He's dead.
[169:48.37]Let's look at this one more time.
[169:52.65]Pillar.
[169:54.37]Jar.
[169:56.75]Yeah, I know he's dead.
[169:59.75]Pillar, jar, wood.
[170:01.70]Robert Patrick.
[170:08.92]Does the computer just not matter?
[170:14.52]If the computer just doesn't matter, I'm gonna be real upset about this.
[170:22.94]So you're talking about... 89... A13C.
[170:25.68]Or just 13.
[170:25.88]89, 13.
[170:25.92]66.
[170:25.94]Robert and Patrick.
[170:28.04]What the fuck does that mean?
[170:29.70]89, 13, 66.
[170:44.49]That guy uploaded a second video yet?
[170:46.73]I said I would stop.
[170:47.65]Yeah, I did.
[170:48.09]But I need to see something.
[171:18.37]Bingo.
[171:23.14]Bingo.
[171:24.16]Just wait.
[171:26.68]Got it.
[171:28.60]Here we go.
[171:38.51]Uh-huh.
[171:42.29]Just give me one second.
[171:50.42]Mm-hmm.
[171:53.44]Play With Me PC.
[171:58.46]I think, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to find out right now what's going on here.
[172:02.96]All right, come on, Markiplier.
[172:05.48]Come on, Markiplier.
[172:06.68]Come on.
[172:20.75]Come on, Markiplier!
[172:21.21]Alright, there's a horrifying clown in the game.
[172:22.83]Let's skip ahead.
[172:23.71]It's not even the same game.
[172:24.66]It's the wrong game.
[172:25.18]There's another game called Play With Me.
[172:50.72]Okay.
[172:51.04]Well, thanks a lot.
[172:51.80]Thanks for trying, Mark.
[172:52.86]I appreciate it.
[172:56.08]There's a different play with me on PC.
[172:58.24]It's not this one.
[172:59.34]It's the wrong game.
[173:01.84]So.
[173:07.15]Is there a clown in this one?
[173:08.69]There might be.
[173:16.21]That game sounds better.
[173:24.58]89A.
[173:25.36]What if somebody had the answer?
[173:27.62]There's the thing, of the 3,000 people that are here, some of you guys, some people are sitting here like, somebody's going to get it.
[173:35.83]That's why I'm buying all this time.
[173:38.11]Somebody is sitting at the computer, some genius, some super genius that went to fucking Yale is sitting there getting this ready for me.
[173:44.31]That's what I'm stalling for.
[173:45.53]Somebody's going to get it right.
[173:47.57]89A13CWE66.
[173:48.01]That seems way too long.
[173:53.18]Admin.
[173:54.38]WB... WB... WBFrog.
[173:57.18]What was it?
[173:57.92]A... A... A... 89.
[173:58.34]A... 13C.
[173:58.44]WE66.
[174:16.89]Fuck.
[174:19.55]89A13.
[174:21.75]This isn't a joke stream.
[174:26.53]One of you scholars needs to figure this out.
[174:30.10]I have to know that this is actually completable.
[174:32.24]Somebody please save me.
[174:37.16]89A13D.
[174:37.28]Combined IQ of the whole chat.
[174:53.47]well hold on let's check something real quick hold on let's just see let's see if that guy's uploaded another video I'm gonna find it I'm going to scour youtube for this no it's gonna be like third room right
[175:23.13]Play With Me PC Room 3.
[175:28.96]No, not the Room 3.
[175:31.42]It's not going to be anywhere.
[175:32.44]Who is that?
[175:32.80]What was that YouTuber?
[175:35.44]What was his name?
[175:38.98]Not Markiplier.
[175:40.68]We're talking about the other YouTuber that made the other video.
[175:43.26]Alright, let's see if we uploaded another one.
[175:52.49]Come on.
[175:53.10]Let's go to this guy's actual channel.
[175:57.88]Okay, what we got here?
[175:59.36]Videos.
[176:02.14]God damn it, he only has part one.
[176:05.03]Come on, don't you know you gotta like pump out the video?
[176:10.35]What about this guy?
[176:10.89]Another YouTuber has it.
[176:14.03]Let's check this one.
[176:17.37]All right, we got an actual YouTuber video.
[176:21.53]Does he get into the room?
[176:24.15]No, it's just the first fucking room.
[176:25.65]God damn it.
[176:26.26]Do you have anything else?
[176:31.60]No, everybody just has the first room done.
[176:35.84]Shit.
[176:41.71]Okay, well, we tried.
[176:55.50]Well, this is very difficult, very hard.
[177:03.10]Use the UV light on the wall with names.
[177:06.34]Look for numbers in the words.
[177:07.60]Holy shit, I think that we got a fucking Yale student here that think they figured it out.
[177:13.01]Yep.
[177:15.25]I think we got somebody that figured it out right now on stream.
[177:18.19]One of our fucking Yales.
[177:19.11]One of our local Ivy League watchers
[177:23.78]Absolutely.
[177:24.38]Figured it out.
[177:27.28]Take a look at this shit.
[177:32.40]Let's do it.
[177:34.42]Check this out.
[177:36.36]This is a test.
[177:39.16]Robert is a murderer.
[177:41.38]Alright, come on, man.
[177:46.52]Robert.
[177:47.16]Is there a code in there?
[177:48.46]There's a secret code right there, right?
[177:52.76]Robert is a murderer.
[178:04.45]Plus 880.
[178:05.05]There's nothing else.
[178:08.13]Don't touch.
[178:09.85]This is a test.
[178:10.91]There's nothing there.
[178:11.71]This is a test.
[178:12.47]It's gone.
[178:15.52]You know, I... That's not correct, but that was a damn good try.
[178:20.66]That was a damn good idea.
[178:23.37]But, uh... I don't think this is a completable rope.
[178:32.14]This is either something so specific... I don't know.
[178:37.01]The numbers on the floor, left to right. 6452137
[178:46.58]Combine the jar note and the pillar number.
[178:48.45]We're just like going full circle.
[178:51.83]A13C89.
[178:53.49]A13C89.
[178:55.51]We're coming.
[179:01.67]We did that.
[179:02.97]We did that.
[179:03.49]We did that.
[179:03.95]We did this.
[179:04.81]We did it.
[179:05.31]Look up.
[179:05.67]Scroll up.
[179:06.03]How do I scroll up?
[179:07.81]We did this one already.
[179:11.37]Got it.
[179:13.11]The stream lives.
[179:15.65]We are, didn't we do that already?
[179:25.87]And that's why the collective intelligence of 3,000 humans.
[179:32.24]We had to have done that.
[179:33.26]There's no way we didn't.
[179:35.12]We tried like nine versions of that.
[179:38.34]Okay.
[179:39.56]Type in help to get help.
[179:42.04]Help.
[179:45.36]List of available commands in the system.
[179:46.90]Cat.
[179:48.52]View the file, e.g.
[179:49.74]cat file.
[179:55.31]View... I want to view the cat.
[179:59.53]Exit.
[180:00.21]Clear.
[180:01.69]Is.
[180:02.83]Log out.
[180:03.51]Mail.
[180:04.53]Run.
[180:04.77]It just got even... It just got even worse.
[180:10.59]Okay, let's... LS.
[180:13.46]We got tennis.alf...
[180:16.88]tennis list of files on the clark clark.txt I don't know what to do mail help how do I go to the fucking mail cat view the file all right say cat
[180:48.31]cat then tennis dot txt I would like to view the file tennis dot exe no txt oh my god cat for the txts and then run for the elves tennis cat tennis dot elf
[181:18.70]The following command, cat tennis.
[181:40.93]Cat tennis dot elf.
[181:51.96]Sorry Run run elf practice Only files ending with elf can be run run tennis dot elf What What the fuck is this I don't want to play any more minigames.
[182:11.56]Oh my god, I'm gonna get my ass kicked It's so slow.
[182:15.98]Just stay in the middle.
[182:16.58]That's that's the secret.
[182:18.86]Oh My god computer win, haha
[182:24.39]I'll beat him.
[182:25.61]This is the fucked up game that Jigsaw wants to play.
[182:27.59]It's tennis.
[182:29.47]Do you see the inhuman movement he just did?
[182:35.51]I probably have to... God.
[182:37.40]Jesus Christ.
[182:38.18]I have to beat this so Jigsaw gives me the special secret fucking ingredient to whatever the hell he does.
[182:44.14]Oh my god.
[182:52.60]That was just David Letterman.
[182:55.34]Why am I doing a David Letterman thing?
[182:57.32]It's not possible to beat this.
[182:59.60]Take... How diabolical.
[183:05.51]I set up a terrible, shitty Pong game.
[183:14.87]Your friend, you must beat me in Pong if you ever want to see your friend Clark alive ever again.
[183:19.71]And by the way, I'm inhumanly fast and you will never win this.
[183:25.66]Good luck.
[183:29.36]The ball starts going too fast for your keyboard to move.
[183:40.75]No!
[183:41.73]I will not be defeated this easily!
[183:43.39]Come on, you need to get the three.
[183:45.89]One, two, three.
[183:47.37]Oh!
[183:49.47]It's going too slow.
[183:51.21]I fucked it up because it was too slow.
[183:54.27]Come on, right there.
[184:03.23]My knees.
[184:05.96]And somebody just shot me with a gun.
[184:13.98]Come on.
[184:15.40]Oh my fucking... Just win.
[184:16.82]Just beat me, please.
[184:25.23]You can't even track like that, man.
[184:27.65]This code is not fair.
[184:31.82]You see how impossible that is to do this?
[184:35.93]Please don't give me shit for this.
[184:37.13]Like, this is not even humanly possible.
[184:43.43]Please don't give me shit for this.
[184:57.35]Come on.
[184:59.01]I gotta, like, trick him.
[185:04.20]There we go.
[185:12.99]No, I'm trying to... I just spit all over my screen.
[185:16.53]I was trying to smash the gate, like, just throw it into the ground.
[185:25.74]Now it gets too fast and it's impossible.
[185:28.32]Jesus.
[185:29.26]I have to beat him before it does that.
[185:40.60]No way.
[185:41.76]No fucking way.
[185:44.84]And the easiest thing in the world will go right by him.
[185:46.84]I hate this.
[185:47.58]I hate this.
[185:48.60]I can't leave until this is done.
[185:50.12]You understand, guys?
[185:50.88]I'm stuck here.
[185:52.29]This is the punishment for me.
[185:57.87]Doing this with the fucking arrow keys.
[186:00.19]Oh, calm down, Jeremy.
[186:09.92]What the f- It even saves your progress.
[186:36.98]Oh my god.
[186:43.98]Just beat him so I can get the... I can blame the arrow keys.
[186:52.10]I'm going to blame the arrow keys because it's awful.
[186:55.06]Why is this not controlled with the mouse?
[186:59.30]Why is this not a mouse controlled thing?
[187:01.28]Why can't I go like this?
[187:03.10]Why does it have to be this?
[187:04.28]Why?
[187:05.45]Do you have to... Why did you make it like this?
[187:08.09]I didn't...
[187:18.76]There's no mouse on this computer.
[187:20.84]This is true, but we're talking... It's my suspension of reality.
[187:25.32]Give me a break.
[187:28.38]That clearly hit me on the paddle.
[187:30.31]That hit me directly into the paddle.
[187:42.96]I hate this.
[188:06.23]I'm out.
[188:06.75]Bye.
[188:08.89]I am done trying to play these uncompletable minigames that they've put in this game.
[188:15.27]Very clearly, this game is just uncompletable.
[188:19.57]It's not a completable fucking minigame.
[189:09.07]This is so impossible.
[189:30.61]This is not possible.
[189:32.91]You have to just get extraordinarily lucky.
[189:39.64]Why does he always, this is not fair!
[189:55.71]Is this true?
[189:57.35]Is it true?
[190:03.48]Somebody said he misses the first shot every time when I restart.
[190:07.22]Is that true?
[190:14.91]He misses shit like that.
[190:15.89]Come on.
[190:47.41]The game is like programmed to not lose like 80% of the time It's programmed look at this program This has a code this gets code attached to it.
[190:58.42]I don't get code I Don't get a code that's guaranteed to hit the ball back.
[191:03.84]No matter what 80% of the time.
[191:05.86]Do you see that shit?
[191:10.03]Did you see that?
[191:12.03]That is just, there's no... I have to beat this on the principle of my own sanity.
[191:18.99]I have to beat the computer code.
[191:21.19]This is like when Hal the robot went up against the number one chess player in the world and the guy beat him.
[191:28.85]I'm gonna beat Hal.
[191:30.35]The fucking like Google deep brain AI went up against like the best chess player in the world and it lost.
[191:36.41]I'm not gonna get won by a fucking bunch of code, you understand?
[191:50.12]What's the stupid fucking Google computer's name?
[191:52.62]Like, Gary?
[191:53.95]I ain't letting a fucking computer AI Gary beat me right now.
[192:02.30]Not a chance.
[192:02.84]Even though he's programmed to win.
[192:06.10]He has the advantage.
[192:07.08]He has the code.
[192:07.82]He has the absolute...
[192:28.53]Got the advantage now.
[192:29.93]Checkmate, motherfucker.
[192:32.35]Checkmate.
[192:36.55]Fuck, he got my queen.
[192:38.65]Checkmate!
[192:40.47]I win.
[192:43.84]That's it.
[192:50.10]Oh, that was for absolutely no reason.
[192:55.08]Don't ever underestimate the humans.
[193:03.31]Yeah, take that, Gary Google.
[193:08.21]Shove it up your ass.
[193:09.09]Alright, what is the... Help.
[193:21.26]What other programs do we get to run?
[193:22.86]Let's take a look at what other programs we have.
[193:27.44]We have a list.
[193:29.40]We have tennis, we have data.
[193:32.03]clark okay so run clark.txt I can't run that so cat view the file cat underscore file name okay so cat underscore clark
[193:50.15]So by the way, if you're wondering, this whole time Clark died, we had a 15 minute timer to get into the computer and unlock the door and save Clark.
[194:01.80]He's been dead for about 49 minutes.
[194:04.27]So none of this really matters at this point.
[194:06.07]So just want to make that clear to everybody.
[194:10.29]The following command has not been recognized.
[194:11.85]Cat underscore Clark.
[194:13.23]What are you talking about?
[194:15.86]Cat.
[194:18.57]under like why can't I do underscore what four five two one okay okay we got another number here four five two one what does that mean somebody write that down I got it writer
[194:46.70]4521.
[194:46.72]Got a code.
[194:47.08]So now, 4521880.
[194:48.44]What was Clark's first name? 4521880.
[195:08.95]Right?
[195:10.01]Let's try it.
[195:13.73]No.
[195:14.83]There's probably more on this computer.
[195:17.89]List.
[195:18.15]Let's see.
[195:18.57]We got data.
[195:19.57]We got Clark.
[195:21.01]ComData1234.
[195:21.61]Let's just try that one.
[195:23.63]Cat.
[195:23.79]ComData1234.text.
[195:25.09]That didn't do anything.
[195:39.35]What?
[195:41.63]It's just, is it just not spaces or anything?
[195:43.29]cat.com.data1234.txt Enter the name of the file you want to view.
[195:58.97]What?
[196:03.02]You put a space at the start.
[196:04.16]What are you talking about?
[196:04.74]A space at the start.
[196:13.74]Just 4521.
[196:26.57]Grandma uses compute.
[196:27.77]No, it's called.
[196:29.32]I don't I use Windows.
[196:31.62]I use Macintosh.
[196:33.32]I don't use old shit computers with a fucking terrible operating system on them, by the way.
[196:39.68]Oh, you should go to Linux.
[196:41.32]Well, yeah, you want to go to Linux?
[196:42.30]What, because there's a fucking penguin on it?
[196:43.66]You like the penguin?
[196:45.37]What does Microsoft have for a mascot?
[196:48.01]A fucking rainbow window?
[196:49.45]That's kind of cool.
[196:51.19]Penguin mascot.
[196:52.21]That's great.
[196:52.57]Go watch fucking Madagascar if you want to see penguins.
[196:56.15]The Macintosh is like the funny guy with the funny face.
[196:58.64]It's like the big nose and the two eyes and the mouth.
[197:02.16]It's a square and he's got that fucked up ugly face.
[197:05.73]We've got a face, a window, and a penguin.
[197:07.65]Which one's the coolest?
[197:10.87]Sorry.
[197:41.32]I can't write... I can't write percent.
[197:43.48]I was writing 7% install base.
[197:47.54]You know, I would make more fun of Linux, but Linux actually is really great, actually.
[197:52.74]People don't know about the Macintosh face?
[197:54.16]Are you serious?
[197:56.43]Go look at it.
[197:56.97]Type in Macintosh face.
[197:58.61]You'll find it.
[197:59.07]It's like from the old iMacs and stuff.
[198:03.91]Electronic lock.
[198:06.47]Correct code.
[198:09.90]Linux actually is a great operating system all jokes aside It's probably the I would say the the most secure that you could possibly get on
[198:23.91]And, I mean, it just has some of the absolute best customer support you could ever have.
[198:31.82]One other thing about Linux is it has a huge library of great titles, great games, great programs.
[198:41.77]And it's great!
[198:42.99]It's great because everything works when you use it on Linux.
[198:48.58]You know, it's not, it's not like the, you know, like, I would say probably a hundred percent of every program that comes out works on Linux.
[199:00.86]It's fucking great.
[199:02.05]All right, what else are we doing?
[199:15.95]Ooh, 5065 plus four.
[199:18.26]I deleted it, it was here.
[199:20.14]5065 plus 4521.
[199:30.23]5-506-5-4-5-2-1-80.
[199:30.39]Oh, shit.
[199:30.65]89.
[199:30.67]What?
[199:30.85]5-506-5-4-5-2-1-80.
[199:51.31]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[200:00.61]5065880?
[200:00.73]Okay.
[200:01.45]Get me the fuck out of this room.
[200:02.45]We can finally leave.
[200:03.79]Congratulations, everybody.
[200:04.73]We did it.
[200:05.75]Let's go check on Clark.
[200:12.96]There he is.
[200:15.89]Great, battery died.
[200:17.95]Is that Clark?
[200:18.67]Do I have to charge it somehow or change it?
[200:26.52]He's just dead.
[200:29.30]How do I charge the battery on the phone?
[200:31.08]Okay, we'll put it down.
[200:34.58]Operating table, syringe.
[200:37.05]Another note, green feed.
[200:38.67]A poison specimen called green feed.
[200:40.99]C2H6HG.
[200:44.60]okay well let's copy down another another code it's my my car door patient on the operating table patient on the operation on the operating table patient on the operating table patient on the operating table he said why does this psycho want to perform and operate have they run out of normal candles light the candle
[201:13.54]Nearly okay.
[201:16.05]The chest has a keypad.
[201:17.93]No, I want to light... You need a code.
[201:20.73]No, get out of here.
[201:21.53]I want to light the candle.
[201:24.13]Let me write the can... Let me light the candle!
[201:31.00]Oh, come on.
[201:33.14]I have to, like, I gotta stop talking.
[201:34.54]Can I just, like, disable the microphone?
[201:36.48]Because, look, we've been playing, we've been to the fourth room.
[201:40.30]This game wanted access to my fucking microphone, right?
[201:44.84]And the only feature in four rooms that we've seen so far is your fucking match blows out if you talk.
[201:53.72]That's the only feature we've seen in the entire game so far that uses the microphone.
[201:56.68]I'm gonna disable it.
[201:57.42]What the fuck is the point?
[202:09.53]Oh, look!
[202:11.97]There's a guy!
[202:19.48]Operating table.
[202:21.72]There's a code.
[202:22.48]There's codes everywhere.
[202:23.52]Still codes.
[202:24.16]We've got codes on top of codes here.
[202:30.40]We can move this back and forth.
[202:32.11]Let's move it out of the way.
[202:40.68]Anything over here?
[202:41.70]Just a door.
[202:43.19]I love you.
[202:43.99]I have your toy.
[202:46.87]There's a battery.
[202:47.63]There's a syringe.
[202:48.57]Got a battery for the phone now.
[202:51.29]What the hell is that?
[202:52.47]What is, like, blurry over here?
[202:54.23]Match?
[202:54.37]Match?
[203:16.09]I hereby sign Dr. Nicholas Webb.
[203:17.77]We were calling... We were trying Eric Webb the whole time.
[203:22.49]How's Eric Webb doing?
[203:24.67]On many occasions, without the knowledge and agreement from my patients, have not provided the help and necessary res... I did it for selfish reasons in order to achieve profit from solid body parts.
[203:34.22]I know it's resuscitation.
[203:35.52]I'm not a fucking idiot.
[203:36.50]I've got a bad headache.
[203:41.98]Let's take this over there again.
[203:46.53]Eric Wiebe.
[203:50.85]Newspaper.
[203:53.20]Exclusive interview with Dr. Nicholas.
[203:56.58]There's a lot of talk about your work at our hospital.
[203:59.68]People say different things.
[204:01.60]You know what I want to ask you about?
[204:02.76]I have nothing else to add on this subject.
[204:06.19]There is talk you sell human organs.
[204:08.05]Is that true?
[204:09.31]I have nothing else to add to this subject.
[204:10.89]I've been found out guilty by the court.
[204:13.47]The court, yes, but not by the people.
[204:15.69]People have collected signatures on a petition to have you suspended from your hospital duties.
[204:20.40]Like I said, I am innocent and I think I am very good at my job.
[204:24.16]I have helped many patients.
[204:26.20]And how many patients have lost their organs so that you can sell them?
[204:29.54]You are impertinent.
[204:30.70]I'm just doing my job.
[204:32.95]The citizens of our city deserve to know the truth.
[204:34.99]This interview is... Oh, why is this written down in a newspaper?
[204:39.70]Exclusive interview with Dr. Nicholas.
[204:41.88]It's written in the first person.
[204:45.83]Why would you wrote this down?
[204:51.53]I don't get it.
[204:55.93]This newspaper was $1,500.
[204:56.35]Why?
[204:56.43]Circulation fee $152.
[204:56.81]Price $1,500 bucks.
[205:08.02]For this exclusive interview with Dr. Nicholas.
[205:13.70]Okay.
[205:14.96]That's expensive shit.
[205:16.38]What else we got?
[205:19.34]That's it.
[205:19.74]Alright, so now I got... I do... Oh, we got... I can already know that's from moving it.
[205:26.95]Okay.
[205:27.81]What do I have in my inventory?
[205:28.87]I've got... Cell phone.
[205:31.99]I got the battery, right?
[205:34.15]Plug it into the phone.
[205:38.81]Okay, battery replaced.
[205:39.99]Let's call the police.
[205:43.15]We got a new message.
[205:45.21]Horoscope.
[205:46.41]Who cares?
[205:47.79]Robert, where are you?
[205:48.65]Can't get a hold of you.
[205:49.43]We already saw this shit.
[205:52.76]Enter the riddle 1.0.
[205:54.26]Who knows what that even is.
[205:58.90]Better.
[205:59.14]Info.
[206:01.40]Signal.
[206:02.34]Actually, I have a signal.
[206:04.58]100%.
[206:06.44]I have a signal.
[206:07.02]Let's try to call the police.
[206:12.33]All right.
[206:13.69]Well, that's... Okay.
[206:15.79]Well, what is this?
[206:19.13]Piece of paper.
[206:20.43]Splitting in half can gain you more.
[206:26.90]Splitting in half.
[206:30.66]I feel horrible right now, apparently.
[206:33.42]Splitting in half can gain you more.
[206:41.70]What?
[206:45.54]Oh, I get it.
[206:47.06]I get it.
[206:49.16]The first thing, it's a one.
[206:50.26]That's a one, two, three, Z7.
[206:54.00]One, two, three, Z7.
[206:55.12]You think you can fucking fool me?
[206:58.80]One, two, three, Z7.
[207:01.19]There we go.
[207:03.93]There's the knife.
[207:06.41]Now we can...
[207:11.56]Put the knife into this guy's fucking chest.
[207:13.08]Okay, well that's... That is actually not what I expected was gonna happen.
[207:19.46]I thought I was gonna... Okay.
[207:23.30]Okay, cool.
[207:24.24]Let's open up his guts.
[207:26.12]He was holding drugs.
[207:31.65]Can I wipe this off?
[207:34.55]Oh. 1980.
[207:41.96]Is that it?
[207:45.30]You are holding this so oddly.
[207:47.58]It's kind of unbelievable.
[207:48.62]1980, huh?
[207:51.60]Alright, well, just remember that.
[207:55.42]1980.
[207:55.72]I think someone's... 1980.
[208:03.97]Cut the bear down in the other room.
[208:09.09]What a weird thing to swallow.
[208:15.29]how can a knife okay so I get there I can't cut this bear down I guess it reminds me of a cord maybe if I had a knife I think a knife could cut it this is a knife
[208:47.70]Okay.
[208:50.18]Now what?
[208:55.62]What was the point of that?
[208:56.32]Where did the bear go?
[209:04.81]What was that?
[209:09.19]What was that for?
[209:12.61]Okay.
[209:13.89]Hope that wasn't an important item.
[209:21.10]It fell down the hole.
[209:22.60]What hole?
[209:23.42]There's no hole here.
[209:31.88]Don't tell me that just fucking broke or something, right?
[209:39.51]Didn't catch the bear.
[209:42.97]How was I supposed to catch the bear?
[209:46.43]We got 1980.
[209:48.86]I feel horrible.
[209:49.66]I think I gotta syringe myself, right?
[209:51.14]Okay, this is gonna be moved again.
[209:53.48]No, is it just 1980?
[209:54.30]So we got 1980 and then this messed up thing.
[209:57.99]C2H6HG.
[209:59.13]He's watching you.
[210:02.43]Yes, he is.
[210:18.71]Anything else?
[210:20.73]Sure would have loved to have that bear.
[210:22.19]I think someone's watching me.
[210:26.25]No shit.
[210:30.14]No shit!
[210:33.12]Empty syringe.
[210:36.92]So, now what?
[210:41.53]I have 1980.
[210:42.78]This is what I called my article.
[210:45.14]We tried this electronic lock.
[210:47.82]Great.
[210:48.86]I will now be able to... On we go.
[210:52.46]1980.
[210:55.66]Room number five.
[210:56.22]Oh, boy.
[211:02.20]Here we go.
[211:04.44]We've got our first scary monster.
[211:07.26]Scary, scary monster.
[211:08.55]The computer doesn't work.
[211:11.25]Power on.
[211:13.54]So, I can move... What did that do?
[211:18.91]Not another one of these.
[211:20.17]Oh, no.
[211:23.07]I'm not going to do that yet.
[211:27.96]These can be moved.
[211:30.66]For some reason, they can be moved.
[211:42.23]But for what?
[211:44.05]That's the question.
[211:47.29]The chest has a lock.
[211:49.03]It's a torch from my car.
[211:50.59]Torch?
[211:51.57]Actually, I never use it.
[211:52.85]What do you mean, torch?
[211:53.95]It has one defect.
[211:55.77]Sometimes it turns itself off, and you need... Oh, don't... Come on, man.
[212:06.70]Like, you're wasting light.
[212:10.17]They have paid me for it.
[212:11.09]They're not humans.
[212:11.82]They're just homeless people.
[212:12.96]The hunting games had to go ahead.
[212:18.98]Scraps of paper.
[212:22.90]1, 3, R, 5.
[212:24.06]V, 7, 7, V, D, T, 5, X, 5, G. Whatever the fuck this means.
[212:35.04]Let's calibrate the computer.
[212:38.39]Can't wait to do this again.
[212:46.49]Same password and everything?
[212:48.85]I hope so.
[212:49.75]What was it?
[212:50.07]I don't even remember what it was.
[212:51.29]Admin?
[213:03.68]What was it?
[213:04.24]A13C89.
[213:06.00]No, it's different.
[213:12.04]So, is it weird that I actually refuse to do this?
[213:16.94]Is this where I give up here?
[213:19.80]I was waiting for the point to use my microphone and it never happened.
[213:34.15]This thing has to- we gotta do something.
[213:35.69]This is gonna like scare us, right?
[213:43.90]Chuck is carved on the chair.
[213:45.48]Chuck is probably the guy with the password.
[213:47.42]I need a key.
[213:49.74]Phobia.
[213:50.11]Okay.
[214:02.32]Does this mean something?
[214:03.08]I can't move these around.
[214:04.04]I can only spin them.
[214:07.41]So what?
[214:07.73]Do I have to connect them and they touch or something?
[214:11.67]I'm gonna assume it's something like that.
[214:15.65]You know, something... something... dumb.
[214:21.31]Like that?
[214:25.91]What does this even mean?
[214:26.75]Who cares?
[214:31.88]I don't think connecting these does anything.
[214:37.44]Use your microphone to scream at them.
[214:39.97]Okay.
[214:44.77]How do I get out of here?
[214:47.01]Hey.
[214:48.00]Didn't do anything.
[214:48.82]Flashlight.
[214:49.04]It's got 0% battery.
[214:50.40]I can't interact with this.
[214:51.66]I need batteries for the torch.
[214:53.72]Clean the mirror.
[214:54.72]That's a good idea.
[214:55.18]Ooh.
[214:55.26]Ooh.
[215:20.10]Oh, there he is.
[215:20.76]Scary guy.
[215:21.60]Alright, almost clean.
[215:22.86]And then the baby's gonna jump out at me.
[215:25.20]Hey look, another code.
[215:26.14]That's a plus 73 plus.
[215:27.03]Interesting.
[215:50.04]So what, I gotta get these mirrors in the right place?
[215:55.34]What did that even do?
[215:58.84]Yeah, what is that even showing me?
[216:00.30]It's not even a real mirror.
[216:07.55]Can I move?
[216:08.03]I can't move the chair.
[216:08.97]Do I have a key?
[216:11.13]I got a key lying around, don't I?
[216:20.56]How can I use this?
[216:23.62]Can't wipe their faces.
[216:27.22]Stab the doll.
[216:28.06]Can't stab doll.
[216:34.90]Use a knife on the lock?
[216:35.85]Nope.
[216:35.95]Something with this paper.
[216:42.46]Dab yourself.
[216:45.18]And now I'm... This is bad.
[216:47.18]Now I'm yawning.
[216:48.04]That's not good.
[216:48.78]We need to do another computer test.
[216:53.32]I don't want to do another computer test.
[216:54.60]You got me here.
[216:59.87]You got me here.
[217:02.87]Sorry.
[217:05.49]How can I use this?
[217:08.79]Burn the paper.
[217:12.84]yeah you got me here I didn't rotate the mirror maybe oh sorry uh sorry guys I I spoke and if you any make any noise this great feature with the microphone integration it just turns off the match it's really cool nearly okay no I need to just uh chandelier what about up here
[217:47.10]Nothing in the rafters.
[217:52.60]There we go!
[217:57.51]Not like that matters at all.
[218:01.35]What is that even trying to show me?
[218:06.35]The Aldemir is going to be in the right place, but what even is the right place?
[218:09.41]That's the note.
[218:16.08]We already saw that note.
[218:19.14]Can I clean the portraits?
[218:21.28]I don't think so, let me try.
[218:27.30]No, doesn't look like it.
[218:29.02]I just have a plus 73.
[218:33.14]Shake the flashlight.
[218:34.05]That's pretty creepy.
[218:47.90]Can I move the pieces of paper?
[218:48.84]I can only rotate them.
[218:50.56]I can't actually move them.
[218:53.80]Can only spin them around.
[218:55.18]Well, I mean, it's 7-7.
[219:07.89]R3T599259.
[219:09.61]Stab the crow.
[219:10.53]Ooh, you got... Yep.
[219:12.21]Thank God we got some fucking Yale students in here.
[219:14.93]Thank God we got some Yale students.
[219:19.94]It's the computer.
[219:33.24]Can't break the mirror.
[219:38.78]Space bar with posters.
[219:42.07]I don't think so.
[219:47.17]Cut the chandelier.
[219:49.71]I can't even interact with the chandelier.
[219:52.93]Burn the dolls.
[219:57.94]You know, I appreciate the effort with this game.
[220:00.86]Hold on, guys.
[220:01.38]Hold on.
[220:01.68]Sorry.
[220:07.32]It's as if it's looking at me.
[220:10.36]It looks very like...
[220:16.08]Okay, so what I was going to say is... Sorry, I had to stop talking, otherwise they would have blown it up.
[220:23.48]What do we got here?
[220:23.90]We got the door over here.
[220:25.92]What's to the right?
[220:26.88]This has to match up with the door, I'm assuming.
[220:30.81]So what else?
[220:31.79]We got the door.
[220:35.17]And then right next to the door, this needs to be a little higher.
[220:39.57]Right?
[220:43.12]Is that correct?
[220:45.97]And then... So that's me standing there.
[220:49.73]What's right above that?
[220:50.85]This one?
[220:52.38]Or this one?
[220:59.40]I need to shine a light the mirrors.
[221:00.76]That's probably true.
[221:01.50]Any drawers?
[221:01.80]Yeah, this is plus 73 in the mirror, but what does that even mean?
[221:20.07]Turn the music off.
[221:25.29]Use the... Yeah, so if we go like this... That's correct.
[221:31.86]This is correct.
[221:35.20]Yeah, I think this is all correct.
[221:37.02]So it looks like we got 5T3R77?
[221:39.78]Because this is the top of the paper.
[221:46.56]I think, yeah, this has to be a 3.
[221:49.32]Where the hell else would this be?
[221:53.83]So I got 5T3R77?
[221:54.59]5T73R11.
[221:54.91]5T73, where are you getting the 7 from?
[222:14.12]5T3R77.
[222:14.30]5T3R77.
[222:14.84]5T3R77.
[222:15.24]5T3R77.
[222:15.92]5T3R77.
[222:16.04]Alton clicked the papers?
[222:19.30]What?
[222:19.70]When could I fucking do this?
[222:42.84]They're just adding game mechanics.
[222:46.98]Alright, now we have to build this.
[222:52.15]Hold Alt.
[222:52.65]Alright, so we got...
[223:10.18]7, R, T, 5, 7, 3.
[223:12.77]7, R. Is it, was it, I don't know.
[223:16.01]I'm just gonna go up to bottom.
[223:17.85]Up, yeah, down.
[223:19.47]7, R, T, 5, 13.
[223:20.31]7, no, 7, R, T, 5, 3, 7.
[223:22.49]7, R. I can't write that on, I can't do that on a calculator.
[223:28.44]Yes, I can.
[223:29.38]7, R. What looks like an R?
[223:33.62]Uh, a 5.
[223:34.00]7, R.
[223:34.56]7, R.
[223:38.50]T is, looks like a 7.
[223:41.62]7RT537.
[223:42.24]I got it on my calculator.
[223:53.87]Okay, R1T513.
[223:57.61]Left to right, like, come on, you want me to read left to right?
[224:00.87]We're reading a manga right now.
[224:04.17]You're literally on a computer right now.
[224:05.45]But I can't alt-tab!
[224:08.61]Did somebody just ask me how this is an R?
[224:10.21]7RT531.
[224:14.80]It's a 12?
[224:15.46]What are you talking about? 12.
[224:39.62]There's no two here.
[224:45.02]They're ones.
[224:50.04]The R is a one and a two together?
[224:51.80]No it is not.
[224:52.70]R15, T13.
[224:52.86]I'm gonna have to go with that one.
[224:59.82]R15, T13.
[225:16.78]I can't believe I played this game for just about four hours now.
[225:19.94]What the hell are we doing?
[225:22.06]Who keeps a calculator on their desk in case I need to do any calculations?
[225:26.40]Are you serious?
[225:29.22]How many times have you guys been sitting on a computer and all of a sudden you have a very complicated math problem that you have to do?
[225:37.70]I'm saving myself time to need to have another window open on my other monitor.
[225:45.21]It just sits right here, and I can... Let's do a calculation right here.
[225:49.37]Let's do one.
[225:52.55]523 times 88.
[225:54.51]That's 46,024.
[225:56.19]I don't need a computer for that.
[226:01.49]You think I need to open up another window?
[226:03.93]No, I got more important shit on my windows.
[226:05.67]I have, for instance, OBS, Twitch chat.
[226:10.13]I got the stream, the actual stream health.
[226:12.37]I got the video game.
[226:15.71]I got my Bitcoin.
[226:19.01]Wow, has that been going great?
[226:20.45]You know, I got my Bitcoin monitor over here.
[226:23.71]Yeah.
[226:24.89]That sure has been going fucking great the last few days.
[226:28.69]Oh, wow.
[226:32.53]He's paying attention to that shit?
[226:36.83]I'll use the machine to use machine.
[226:40.50]I'm just going to play tennis elf.
[226:45.22]I really would.
[226:52.28]All right.
[226:53.08]I've lost thousands of dollars.
[226:56.81]No, no.
[226:58.47]Let me tell you something, guys.
[227:00.35]BTC is old news.
[227:02.89]We've got to do a little bit of calculations here.
[227:07.41]We've got digital apps on the Ethereum blockchain.
[227:11.45]We're talking about things...
[227:13.75]I am all in.
[227:16.29]All in.
[227:16.87]There it is.
[227:22.05]What are we doing?
[227:22.77]Launch application.
[227:23.75]Wait, we got another one.
[227:24.61]Wait.
[227:26.17]Is there another minigame here?
[227:27.75]Oh, no.
[227:28.45]Not another one of these.
[227:31.75]Tap ufo.elf.
[227:40.17]Only files ending with elf can be run.
[227:41.77]Isn't that what I just did?
[227:45.57]Run.
[227:47.03]Tap.
[227:49.83]UFO.elf.
[227:54.88]What am I doing wrong?
[228:03.24]Oh, no.
[228:04.16]Another one of these.
[228:04.96]Game over.
[228:05.44]Am I supposed to press...
[228:22.42]What's going on?
[228:23.00]How do I play?
[228:23.96]This actually is Flappy Bird, but how do I play it?
[228:31.24]This is so important.
[228:32.80]I need to play this.
[228:33.42]We have to beat every one of the minigames.
[228:39.69]It's actually bugged out.
[228:46.91]Turn it off and turn it on again.
[228:50.81]It's just my mouse, but it's not...
[229:03.92]Tap UFO.
[229:11.26]Oh well.
[229:13.08]We tried.
[229:13.46]You have to scream jump.
[229:21.95]Thank God this game, hold left click.
[229:24.37]Isn't that what I was just doing?
[229:26.69]Run tap elf, tap UFO.
[229:28.61]What was that old virus video game?
[229:32.87]No, it's not doing anything.
[229:47.77]Alright, is there like a help on Happy Bird?
[229:53.17]Whatever.
[229:55.21]It's not the microphone.
[229:56.63]No way.
[230:05.93]Ah!
[230:06.67]Ah!
[230:06.91]Ah!
[230:07.17]Ah!
[230:07.47]Why would I even... Turn the fucking... No, turn the computer... Yeah, turn it up.
[230:15.65]You need to come up with a calculation.
[230:18.25]Now, don't break this.
[230:18.99]This is expensive.
[230:20.21]This is like $8 at Walmart.
[230:24.01]Quick, somebody give me a math problem.
[230:24.97]Somebody give me a math problem.
[230:26.43]Come on.
[230:27.83]Anything.
[230:28.18]Doesn't matter what it is, I'll get it.
[230:30.42]I'll go into my fucking all-knowing, all-seeing mind.
[230:32.78]Give me a math problem.
[230:37.61]You fucking idiots.
[230:39.23]I ain't gonna do math right now.
[230:40.49]Good luck.
[230:41.17]Do it on your own time.
[230:44.10]I got Happy Bird to play.
[230:47.54]You fucking idiots.
[230:52.06]I'm just kidding.
[230:52.72]I love you guys.
[230:53.22]You guys are idiots.
[230:57.06]Why is this not working now?
[231:06.83]tap run ufo.elf crazy old man yelling alright data.txt cat data.exe no cat data.txt at file data.txt what the fuck are you doing
[231:54.54]Clear it.
[231:55.40]Clear the console.
[231:57.78]But I forget what the buttons are.
[232:00.12]Cat.
[232:04.56]Cat.
[232:06.46]Data.

[232:19.66]Comdata Blizzard.
[232:24.72]Oh boy.
[232:25.92]I know what's going to happen when I do this.
[232:31.26]Blizzard was here, you know what I mean.
[232:32.86]I don't.
[232:36.38]Is the new Overwatch hero going to leak here?
[232:38.40]Yeah.
[232:42.54]Blizzard was here.
[232:44.86]I'm going to enter it.
[232:45.74]I was going to go... Come on.
[232:49.76]Give me one... Give me one fucking joke in this whole stream, please.
[232:53.52]Just one.
[233:00.82]I get one.
[233:02.42]Each stream.
[233:05.96]Okay.
[233:08.87]Can't wait to find out what is here.
[233:18.85]Let's open it up.
[233:19.87]Let's see what's in the blizzard.txt file.
[233:23.49]What?
[233:25.07]Are you kidding me?
[233:30.29]WHAT DO THEY HAVE?!
[233:36.35]IT'S A NEW FUCKING HERO!
[233:44.44]IT'S GENGI!
[233:46.82]HEELS AND ARROWS!
[233:55.03]Turn it off.
[234:08.93]You know what I mean?
[234:09.49]Like, it's just a fucking joke.
[234:14.43]It's just... We're just fucking around here.
[234:16.77]ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
[234:18.67]WHAT?!
[234:21.83]NEW HERO!
[234:24.52]WHAT?!
[234:28.40]HOT DOG!
[234:28.98]IT'S A GUY IN A HOT DOG SUIT!
[234:32.92]HE THROWS MUSTARD!
[234:44.42]I didn't save any of my stuff.
[235:10.84]I wrote so much stuff.
[235:18.29]I had so many things written.
[235:19.63]Why the hell?
[235:35.09]Alright.
[235:37.79]I'm so... I think we might be done with this game.
[235:41.87]If I'm honest, I think that's it.
[235:43.47]I think we gotta go out on that one.
[235:44.93]I think that's where we're done.
[235:47.66]That's definitely where it has to end.
[235:50.54]What is happening?
[235:55.03]Oh, my phone's like... My phone, my data, it's bloating.
[235:59.01]Oh, God.
[236:03.71]But really, though.
[236:04.35]Did you hear about this?
[236:06.68]What happened?
[236:18.93]What am I trying again?
[236:25.47]Get out of here.
[236:31.92]Oh, fuck.
[236:32.34]I activated the voice thing.
[236:34.46]At least somebody's listening.
[236:35.62]Hey, Cortana!
[236:41.18]Something went wrong.
[236:41.86]Try again in a little while.
[236:46.26]Hey, Cortana!
[236:46.84]How about just use a bag of Fritos?
[236:51.92]No, it's not working.
[236:53.42]Sorry.
[236:56.94]All right.
[236:57.84]I think that's going to be it.
[237:04.91]I think that's the end of the stream.
[237:06.69]I got to get out of this.
[237:07.43]I think we've peaked tonight.
[237:09.51]What do you mean, no?
[237:11.05]What do you mean, no?
[237:26.27]What do you mean?
[237:26.77]Hold on.
[237:30.95]Just give me a second.
[237:33.36]What do you mean no?
[237:40.96]24 hour stream.
[237:41.58]Well, I can't, I don't feel well today.
[237:43.56]I don't feel good.
[237:45.06]I don't feel good.
[237:46.51]My head kind of hurts.
[237:47.57]I have stomach ache.
[237:48.73]I can't stream.
[237:56.03]Uh, give me, hold on, let me look at this.
[237:57.37]Let me see... How about this?
[238:07.54]Yeah, we're gonna, give me a second, we're gonna go... Don't go anywhere yet.
[238:13.22]It's important.
[238:16.72]I really hope I don't get, like, a fucking phone virus right now.
[238:21.13]I don't know why I'm doing this, but I'm doing it, like...
[238:27.12]This thing's probably going to listen to my phone calls now.
[238:33.38]Alright, give me a sec. ...
[239:22.12]I need to shut this fucking lady up.
[239:23.48]All right, let's do I want to do this We're gonna go over this Yeah, you ready?

[239:46.21]It's going to be the greatest wall.
[239:47.97]It's going to be a big, beautiful wall.
[239:52.62]Okay, let's see.

[240:10.67]Big streamer.
[240:11.67]Fantastic streamer.
[240:12.97]He's got a really, really beautiful attitude.
[240:15.35]And I really, I love, muah, I love to kiss him.

[240:34.36]Start the trial.
[240:38.19]Oh shit.
[240:38.79]This is like, this is $7 a month to use this.
[240:45.55]I paid for it.
[240:47.03]How do I, how do I cancel this?
[240:57.39]I just bought it.
[240:58.01]I just, I just spent, I spent $7 a month.
[241:10.90]How much is that?
[241:11.42]$7.99 a month.
[241:13.90]You thought I was lying?
[241:16.49]Bullshit, he's lying.
[241:17.39]$7.99 times 12.
[241:21.21]95 times 5 years.
[241:23.39]That's $479 for 5 years.
[241:31.47]I think I got played, by the way.
[241:32.72]There's a lot of voices here.
[241:33.92]We're going to go through.
[241:34.50]I don't care.
[241:35.58]This is what we're doing.
[241:38.26]Germanan85.

[242:05.21]It doesn't work.
[242:08.07]Come on, I just paid for this.
[242:13.87]I just bought this fucking stupid app.
[242:17.12]I just paid for it.
[242:21.34]I gotta close it and open it again.
[242:25.96]I just got scammed on stream.
[242:27.26]You just watched it happen.
[242:33.84]This is a test.
[242:35.18]Please work for the love of God.
[242:41.75]Okay, it works.
[242:47.41]That was Obi-Wan Kenobi, by the way.
[242:49.53]Don't ask me why.
[242:51.15]Who are these people?
[242:52.32]This is such a waste of fucking money.
[243:03.25]Jerma985, one of the most intelligent, absolutely scrumptiously smart people I've ever come across in my entire life.
[243:11.84]One thing that I will tell you about him.
[243:13.70]Oh, muah, molto bene.
[243:16.04]He's got such a beautiful face and his content is top notch.
[243:20.37]Hallelujah.
[243:47.11]Jerma985, one of the most talented people I've ever seen.
[243:51.23]As what a beauty.

[243:59.82]German, one of the most talented people I've ever seen.
[244:02.42]As what a beauty.
[244:03.08]He's got a great personality.
[244:07.66]This is fucking, this is stupid.
[244:10.03]This is really, really fucking stupid.
[244:14.29]Oh God, this is like me pranking one of my friends.
[244:17.96]Hey Greg, it's your president, Donald Trump.
[244:22.25]Just calling to let you know, you better not be late for work tomorrow, or it's gonna be your job.
[244:27.79]Hey Greg, it's your president, Donald Trump.
[244:37.43]Just calling to let you know, you better not be late for work tomorrow, or it's gonna be your job.
[244:43.65]Oh, you would never know it was fake!
[244:50.04]Ha ha ha ha ha hee hee.
[244:52.18]It's President Donald Trump calling.
[244:54.82]Leave a message at the tone, right, Dale?
[244:58.50]Just calling to make sure you know that I don't like your wife's cooking.
[245:03.55]Ha ha ha, got you, dummy.
[245:14.10]Nobody should use this ever.
[245:14.82]Alright, this is Peter Griffin.
[245:15.70]We gotta do a good Peter Griffin here.

[264:19.17]Other problems that will cease to be said.

[265:37.27]But thank you, LaFerro, for the $1.
[265:38.51]Do we prefer Jar Jar over Rose?

[265:50.22]Thanks for the $1.

[265:52.86]I think we got that one earlier.
[265:55.32]Never trust purple.
[265:55.86]Thanks for the $5.
[265:56.98]Play with myself.
[265:57.64]Why'd I do this to us?
[265:58.34]I don't know.

[266:00.72]GummyBear68.
[266:01.65]Thanks for the $10.
[266:02.19]EU-friendly stream.
[266:03.79]Cheers to that.
[266:04.37]It's true.
[266:05.69]We did do an EU-friendly stream tonight.
[266:09.91]Today.
[266:10.67]It's because I wasn't really feeling that well.
[266:13.95]And I'm just going to kind of go relax.
[266:15.51]I'm going to have a red rooibos tea.
[266:19.41]And then probably try to get some rest.
[266:21.55]But appreciate it.
[266:22.59]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[266:24.13]Marshall, Marshall.

[266:29.10]Thanks for the $1.
[266:29.60]Thanks for the EU stream.
[266:30.74]I follow you for five years.
[266:31.92]Thanks for teaching me English with your videos.
[266:33.92]Cheers from Italy.
[266:36.58]Thank you, Marvash.
[266:39.49]I'm glad that I can be your barometer for English.
[266:43.69]And even I don't speak English that well.
[266:45.67]It's funny, but I'm glad I could teach you.
[266:48.02]Let's start with the basics.
[266:50.08]Okay.
[266:50.72]Conjunctions.
[266:51.78]To, and, if, but.
[266:54.36]Adjectives.
[266:55.38]Large.
[266:56.66]Sexy.
[266:57.72]Interesting.
[266:58.84]Adverbs.
[267:00.50]Coulda, kind of, woulda.
[267:05.24]Sononograms.
[267:07.23]A-E-I-O-U.
[267:10.21]Uh, continents.
[267:12.21]A, no, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, no, not the I, H, J, K, L, semicolon.
[267:24.02]Um...
[267:26.84]There and there, they sound, there.
[267:28.74]There and there sound exactly the same.
[267:30.46]Spelled differently mean different things.
[267:31.66]T-H-E-R-E means a place.
[267:33.76]T-H-E-I-R means a relative.
[267:38.05]That is a relative of yours.
[267:44.75]Thank you, though.
[267:45.41]Appreciate it.
[267:47.45]Hope you stick around longer.
[267:49.11]Maybe we could teach you some more English.
[267:51.81]You want to know how to say swear?
[267:54.01]Everybody wants to know how to say the swears in the other languages, right?
[267:57.47]You want to know a big swear in English?
[268:05.30]Chocolate.
[268:05.78]Whoa!
[268:07.70]I said it.
[268:08.70]I said the C word.
[268:09.98]Chocolate.
[268:14.50]Thank you for ban incoming.
[268:18.66]Booger.
[268:20.07]Booger.
[268:22.90]I thank you sticks for the $1.
[268:24.04]Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
[268:25.82]Too bad the same can't be said about your tallness and hair.
[268:30.50]I have plenty of hair.
[268:33.29]I could turn this webcam on and yank all my hair and it would probably come off.
[268:38.65]So I'm not going to do that.
[268:40.85]Thank you Core Monster for the $5.
[268:42.33]I'm very lucky to have an off stream today.
[268:47.29]And I'm very lucky to have $5 from you Core.
[268:49.86]Thank you.
[268:51.66]Appreciate that.
[268:52.65]And then Ben came in.
[268:53.71]We saw Ben earlier with $100, and he gave another $50.
[268:58.25]So, Ben, thanks for the double $25 here.
[269:01.43]I did not kill her.
[269:02.21]I did not.
[269:04.03]Apparently, it's a very good movie.
[269:06.86]You know what I was going to say.
[269:08.60]The artist that has a lot of issues and causes problems.
[269:12.44]Thank you, Ben, for the $25 there.
[269:13.46]And another $25.
[269:13.84]MgoodMgoodCoolCat.
[269:20.26]I don't know if those are emotes or not, but Ben, you are a wonderful, wonderful contributor.
[269:25.27]Thank you for the $150 here.
[269:27.77]It's a fucking lot of money, dude.
[269:28.83]Thank you so much.
[269:31.41]I said the meme.
[269:32.97]Oh, well.
[269:33.45]Whoops.
[269:35.19]TechnoToast, thanks for the 75 bits.
[269:36.81]Local streamer gets stuck in mobile game hell fighting space meatballs in Jigsaw's basement.
[269:45.30]Look, this game...
[269:47.15]This is a good iPad game.
[269:48.27]If you were to lie down and be able to look at the codes and accidentally blow out your match for the whole entire microphone game mechanic, it's alright.
[269:59.20]I think this is actually a decent game.
[270:02.22]It's one of those relaxing games where you click on stuff and you make puzzles.
[270:07.74]It's alright.
[270:08.40]We were just relaxing today.
[270:10.00]We're not going to run people, like I said in the very beginning of the stream.
[270:13.45]We're not running anybody over with cars today.
[270:16.29]We're on computers.
[270:17.25]We're playing Pong.
[270:18.35]It's alright.
[270:18.89]Sometimes you need one of those.
[270:21.21]But thank you, Techno.
[270:22.75]Toby.
[270:23.11]Thank you, Toby Muerto.
[270:24.13]You're my favorite space fighter.
[270:25.44]Thank you, Toby.
[270:26.74]Not Jazz.
[270:27.24]Thanks for the two bucks.
[270:27.94]Try turning it on and off again.
[270:30.10]Thank you.
[270:31.68]Little Feisty.
[270:32.48]Thanks for the four dollars.
[270:33.38]I subbed to the stream recently because you made a very hip reference to PUBG and I'm still waiting for you to play it instead of Nokia Snake.
[270:40.89]I would like a refund.
[270:43.21]Well, I can tell you with the utmost certainty that
[270:46.24]that I am absolutely never, never, never, never, 100% ever going to play PUBG again.
[270:58.44]The only way I will, I will play PUBG in one scenario.
[271:05.60]If PUBG deposited $100 a minute into your checking account while you played it,
[271:16.73]Okay.
[271:17.99]Until they put that update out, I don't know when they're planning on doing that update, but if they do, then maybe I'll play it.
[271:26.34]Sellout.
[271:27.44]You calling me a sellout?
[271:29.94]Who wouldn't do that?
[271:32.52]If somebody was gonna pay you $100 a minute to play a game like PUBG just to play it, you telling me all you guys wouldn't do that?
[271:41.22]One... Hold on a second.
[271:44.48]Excuse me?
[271:48.27]$100 a minute.
[271:50.79]There are 60 seconds in a minute.
[271:53.53]There are 60 minutes in a second, right?
[271:55.11]So we got $100.
[271:55.55]There is, hold on.
[271:57.19]$100 times a minute.
[271:58.07]There are 60 minutes in an hour.
[271:59.07]Times 60.
[271:59.21]6,000.
[271:59.59]How many hours are in a day?
[272:00.59]25.
[272:00.61]Times 25.
[272:01.19]Times 24.
[272:01.58]$144,000 a day.
[272:02.60]By the way,
[272:18.66]How many days are in a year?
[272:19.78]365, if you play every single day.
[272:22.94]That is $52,560,000.
[272:23.40]And we're not done.
[272:24.88]Let's say you play for 10 years.
[272:26.44]10 years every day, ladies and gentlemen, that would be $525,600,000.
[272:29.36]But we're not done there.
[272:30.13]Let's say you decide to give half of that to your little brother.
[272:45.38]So that is divided by, no, that's minus, that is divided by two.
[272:50.51]That leaves you with 262 million, but we're not done there.
[272:53.41]Let's say you decide to give...
[272:55.25]Let's say $165 million to charity.
[272:58.77]Because, I mean, that's a lot of money.
[273:00.68]$165 million.
[273:01.52]That's 1-0, 2-0, 3-0s.
[273:03.92]We are at $165 million.
[273:06.24]That would equal $97 million you're left with.
[273:08.50]Got to talk about Uncle Sam there.
[273:09.80]Minus 30 times .3.
[273:11.72]That would be... No, you'd have been in a different tax bracket there.
[273:15.24]That's... Oh, but that was $98 million.
[273:16.74]$98 million times... $98...
[273:24.75]million times 0.38 you're in a bigger tax bracket that's 37 million go straight to uncle sam 98 million minus 37 million that leaves you with 61 but maybe you leave 72 million dollars on a train now maybe you lose maybe you lose six million dollars you understand I just did taxes
[273:52.23]That's not how tax bracket works.
[273:53.35]Yes, it does.
[273:54.11]You have a tax bracket.
[273:56.25]38% if you make more than $600 million.
[274:02.75]Bet you guys can't do this one.
[274:07.73]Let's see how... Alright, you guys want to fuck?
[274:09.43]You guys want to fuck with me?
[274:10.65]Fine.
[274:11.97]You guys want to fuck with me?
[274:12.69]Fine.
[274:13.98]I'm going to give Chad a math problem and I'm going to give you an extra... I'm going to give you an extra 30 seconds to get it done.
[274:21.78]Okay?
[274:23.22]If you can do this before me, then I'm going to give $77 million of my $125 million paycheck this year to my little brother.
[274:33.17]Okay?
[274:33.97]Do you want to fuck with me?
[274:36.17]Here's the problem.
[274:36.85]Ready?
[274:38.47]You get 30 seconds.
[274:39.05]$646,000 $646,230 $646,230 divided by
[274:55.51]291.
[274:55.53]Go.
[274:55.63]You get 30 seconds.
[275:18.53]You guys have calculators.
[275:20.01]You guys are on a computer.
[275:22.35]Like I'm talking to an audience in a theater.
[275:24.01]You guys have your own calculators.
[275:28.14]Turn it off.
[275:31.30]You guys have your own fucking... I'm such an idiot.
[275:33.80]Whatever.
[275:34.96]I guess my little brother has half my fucking fortune.
[275:37.92]Whatever.
[275:38.97]Thank you.
[275:41.44]And thank you again to Foof.
[275:52.58]Thank you, Foof, for the $1.
[275:54.02]Finally farmed enough bits to cheer.
[275:55.98]Also, heck you.
[275:58.31]Heck you, game.

[276:07.95]Appreciate the fact that you would even do that and even consider doing that for me.
[276:11.45]Yeah, 345, thanks for the $1.
[276:13.95]The numbers, Mason, what do they mean?
[276:16.88]I don't know.
[276:17.26]What do they mean?
[276:20.12]There we go.
[276:21.28]Subtitles, 44, thanks for the $1.
[276:23.76]And then you told me how to say your name, and I already fucking forget.
[276:28.31]I already don't remember what it is.
[276:31.79]It's... Thank you for the $5.
[276:36.80]I just want to say that the power went out two times just now because I wanted to boil water while I watched you stream.
[276:42.02]Can you go offline so I can make some tea?
[276:51.67]There.
[276:54.29]Thanks for the $5, Zoot.
[276:56.61]Thank you Nova Maelstrom for the Maelstorm for the $1.
[277:00.11]Do you remember that Kingpin video years ago that's no longer up?
[277:03.09]It was great.
[277:03.74]I miss it.
[277:05.04]Also, keep up this disappointing work.
[277:08.60]I've talked about this before.
[277:10.98]I'll try to like reiterate it again.
[277:12.26]A long time ago, I was cleaning up my YouTube channel.
[277:17.65]Because you were talking like years ago, like five, six plus years ago, there was just trash that was on the channel.
[277:25.29]There was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 live gameplay fucking commentaries on there.
[277:32.27]Just where I played like three rounds of Call of Duty and it was just like, get this out of here.
[277:37.69]I don't want to even smell this ever again.
[277:40.27]There was a bunch of just random, there was like 15 second videos that I didn't like have unlisted.
[277:47.59]And I just kind of was going through and checking boxes.
[277:50.91]Like, yeah, that one was dumb.
[277:52.31]That video sucked.
[277:54.25]And I went a little too far.
[278:00.81]The Modern Warfare 3 videos is still great.
[278:04.46]I literally was deleting history.
[278:06.82]Because I'm a moron.
[278:08.00]And I was trying to clean up the channel in quotes.
[278:12.44]And it actually ended up being...
[278:16.32]the machinima mlg grandpa no actually those all got they they got rid of those I didn't delete those make the unlisted playlist I would if I still had them I just don't have them anymore they're not some old hard drive I don't even have them and it's upsetting to me and it really like makes me sad every time the more what's the moral of the story the moral of the story is um
[278:41.66]Don't go try to clean up your channel and delete old shit videos that you don't think anyone wants to watch.
[278:49.50]Because somebody always does.
[278:52.21]Apparently, I guess.
[278:54.11]Because I would go back and see those videos and it's like, oh, we're going to be real talk here.
[279:00.02]Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
[279:02.44]Live one life 18 minute video where I just run around and be terrible at Call of Duty.
[279:11.52]Those videos had like five percentile of the view counts of any of the other videos I ever made.
[279:16.30]So in my mind, it was...
[279:18.42]I'll just get rid of him, who cares.
[279:20.76]No one's watching him anyways and I don't want to have a bunch of bloated shit on my channel because it was at that point that I was trying to make playlists where it was videos that I knew that I liked and I knew that I was certain that I put time into.
[279:34.26]I was making playlists at the time and those were just caught in the crossfire for some dumb reason.
[279:42.20]Kingpin got deleted but Otto's dog farts messing up my game.
[279:45.71]Uncensored Jerma gets to stay.
[279:51.67]Yeah, but like I stopped.
[279:53.23]That's a long, grueling process.
[279:56.13]I probably thought that was a great video five and a half years ago.
[280:02.09]Six years ago, I probably, whatever, but not six.
[280:04.29]It was like 2012.
[280:04.69]That is kind of, that is six years ago.
[280:08.83]Okay, I'm not crazy.
[280:10.14]Holy shit, I'm getting old.
[280:17.59]Octo dad video got deleted too.
[280:19.27]I know I fucking loved that video.
[280:21.31]Oh, this is making me sad I try to bury it in my brain every now and again But that's kind of the reasoning there.
[280:28.62]I've not done that since So Yeah, I deleted octodad.
[280:35.32]I know it's I this is a long time ago.
[280:37.47]I didn't just do this yesterday This is like four years ago three years ago.
[280:41.19]I
[280:46.60]I know.
[280:47.68]I know.
[280:48.00]I'm just an idiot.
[280:50.02]Anyways, that's the story.
[280:52.90]Thank you, Sly161, for the two bucks.
[280:57.91]Can we play a fun game next, please?
[281:00.79]Yeah, if I don't stream tomorrow, then Friday.
[281:02.67]I think we're gonna do... I think we're gonna start to fuck around in two worlds on Friday.
[281:09.41]I've been holding that one for a rainy day for a long time.
[281:12.11]Maybe we'll start that on Friday.
[281:14.43]Two worlds.
[281:16.77]Then the great Lord Walden gave and gave 50 bucks.
[281:19.43]Thank you, Walden.
[281:20.43]Again, that's a huge amount of money.
[281:21.51]Thank you so much.
[281:23.53]TheRealBillyBorso, thanks for the 450 ocean man.
[281:27.33]Referring to my desktop background.
[281:28.63]Thank you.
[281:29.93]Oh, we probably need music here.
[281:31.63]Whoops.
[281:34.09]Reaper, thanks for the $1 Reaper 500 aqua crotch.
[281:38.19]Yeah, it blew up too much on the background.
[281:39.71]I just didn't have time to fix it before the stream.
[281:43.87]BlowG, thanks for the $1.
[281:45.41]Derma, I've got your number.
[281:46.85]It's 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.
[281:51.58]That is incorrect.
[281:52.38]That is the name of the song.
[281:55.52]I'm not even sure what happens if you dial that number.
[281:57.43]It's probably out of service.
[281:59.51]Thank you.
[282:01.88]Uh, the Triple Ninja, thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[282:04.80]Jerma, this is a long one, but stick with me.
[282:07.52]First time giving you bits, so this is being... So this being my welcoming message.
[282:12.58]Uh, yeah.
[282:13.58]You've been my favorite YouTube person and streamer disguised as a rat for four years now.
[282:17.62]So thank you for this, first of all.
[282:19.43]And now watch that Nintendo.
[282:21.85]Watch what Nintendo just released, then buy it and stream it.
[282:25.85]I'm talking about the cardboard box stuff.
[282:29.67]What did Nintendo just come out with?

[283:28.92]Where I go, whoa!
[283:36.36]Uh browser source There it is, let's give it a watch So is this like the new amiibo or something All right, so then you may make a stencil so it's like the wonder book
[284:11.53]You can still hear the music.
[284:13.65]What is this?
[284:19.15]So you'd make a 3D printed piano.
[284:26.42]What the hell is going on?
[284:29.12]What?
[284:42.98]I don't understand what this is for.
[284:52.60]So you build a peripheral for a game.
[285:00.87]Nintendo, what a great idea, Nintendo.
[285:05.27]Excellent idea.
[285:07.24]I love it.
[285:07.70]Let's add more fucking garbage.
[285:11.26]then kids are gonna make a thousand of these, and they're not gonna properly recycle the cardboard.
[285:15.89]And then we're gonna add more waste to our landfills.
[285:21.27]Excellent job, Nintendo!
[285:22.23]Should've made it in a goddamn file to break it!
[285:31.99]You gotta break it!
[285:33.13]Oh, that was a pizza box!
[285:37.27]You open it up, you get a pizza!
[285:47.68]Look, you can play fucking bird games!
[285:54.34]Where's the console, though?
[285:59.70]Discover.
[286:03.44]Oh, what?
[286:04.02]Your friend can win our pizza!
[286:05.12]A pizza backpack?
[286:09.08]You can color in your pizza box?
[286:12.26]Any color I want?
[286:14.46]Oh, even a piano pizza!
[286:17.85]This is so cool.
[286:22.71]Wow!
[286:25.36]Unbelievable.
[286:26.22]I can't wait for Nintendo to charge like $40 for cardboard.
[286:43.12]Wait, it's $70?
[286:45.47]Shut the fuck up.
[286:47.48]Shut up.
[286:48.88]What do you mean it's $70?
[286:52.60]What is... What's $70?
[286:53.58]What do you... What is $70?
[286:59.51]What is it?
[287:00.15]What is $70?
[287:00.41]What are you referring to?
[287:02.03]Nintendo Labo price.
[287:08.21]What are you buying?
[287:11.45]What?
[287:11.73]Hold on.
[287:12.11]Nintendo Labo's price and launch date, but what even is it?
[287:20.51]$70.
[287:21.37]The price of the variety kit is roughly $10 more than a full Nintendo Switch game.
[287:27.11]But at $70, it's still a nice price.
[287:29.55]They put nice in italics.
[287:32.70]April 20th.
[287:37.00]The robot kit will launch for $80.
[287:38.68]And then they say, I don't really have an opinion on that price point.
[287:44.90]I don't understand, though.
[287:46.08]What is Nintendo?
[287:46.92]Is it a game?
[287:51.54]So it's a game, but you also need cardboard to use it.
[287:55.28]To play it.
[288:01.60]I'm sold.
[288:02.56]Let's do it.
[288:03.79]I can't wait to make like four or five- That's the joke, by the way, guys.
[288:06.71]And you heard it.
[288:07.53]This is secret.
[288:08.45]Secret.
[288:09.29]Keep this to yourselves.
[288:10.59]Seriously, please don't tell anybody about this because this is what I'm going to do for the joke.
[288:14.05]Like, I'm just- I'm going to have a ton of pizzas.
[288:17.12]I'm gonna order, like, eight or nine Domino's pizzas.
[288:21.08]And just, I'm gonna, I'm going to put the pizzas inside of those things.
[288:24.64]And those are my pizza boxes.
[288:26.40]Don't fucking tell anybody that shit.
[288:27.63]That's mine.
[288:28.35]Don't steal it.
[288:30.75]Don't you steal that from me.
[288:31.61]It's trademarked.
[288:34.51]I'm gonna make a bunch of pizza boxes.
[288:39.19]What stops people making their own idea?
[288:41.58]I don't, what?
[288:43.14]Wait, hold on a minute.
[288:44.00]Why don't you just...
[288:45.93]Why don't you just buy cardboard and cut it up and make a funny little piano?
[288:52.03]This is the equivalent of selling those VR goggles and VR controllers for your cell phone.
[289:00.54]Right?
[289:02.80]You know the VR thing where you just stick your cell phone fucking a quarter of an inch in front of your eyes?
[289:08.70]This is that.
[289:10.11]Why do you need that?
[289:11.65]Why don't you just hold it in front of your face?
[289:16.54]Selling already peeled oranges.
[289:21.42]You can't get the game standalone.
[289:27.15]Because it's the game too, the cardboard is like 10 bucks.
[289:34.21]Oh, it might be funny just to do one of those streams.
[289:37.04]And have a Switch and just make a fucking stupid cardboard.
[289:41.04]Don't even use their stencils.
[289:42.94]I'm gonna make like eight pizza boxes.
[289:45.14]And be super excited.
[289:46.08]Like, nice!
[289:46.84]Whoa!
[289:47.38]And like eat the pizza and shit.
[289:48.44]And like that's the game.
[289:49.76]I'm gonna have the Switch controllers in my hands.
[289:52.82]I'm gonna color in the pizza boxes with like markers and shit.
[289:55.17]And be so happy and excited about it.
[289:58.03]Mark it on your calendar.
[289:58.99]April.
[289:59.57]April 20th when that comes out.
[290:00.55]That's what we're doing.
[290:08.42]I don't own a Switch.
[290:10.52]That's the reason why I'm buying a Switch.
[290:12.36]You heard it here.
[290:13.52]That's gonna be fun.
[290:18.34]Anywho.
[290:19.72]Thank you.
[290:21.22]Thank you, Triple Ninja, for showing that to us.
[290:27.12]Should be a very interesting product.
[290:28.66]I'm sure we'll give it a try.
[290:30.64]Thank you, Pin for the $1.
[290:31.94]Pin for the $1.
[290:33.30]Did you buy the dip?
[290:36.20]Oh, you're referring to
[290:38.42]The great Bitcoin crash of 2018.
[290:40.54]No, I am more of a gentle observer.
[290:49.63]I'm a gentle observer with my toes.
[290:52.69]You know, I dip my toes in the water.
[290:54.69]Ooh, it's a little cold in there.
[290:56.31]But I'm an observer.
[290:57.11]I'm a gainer of knowledge.
[291:00.50]I need to process as much information up here as I can.
[291:02.40]You know?
[291:05.32]I need to process as much information on a daily basis as I possibly can fit in my brain.
[291:11.16]It's just, that's why I got, you know, a calculator right here.
[291:17.24]I need to be full of knowledge.
[291:19.18]Best advice I can give you as a 39-year-old man, process knowledge every day.
[291:25.16]And you'll be worth a trillion dollars in 2025.
[291:26.70]Thanks, little dude.
[291:34.03]Thank you, Jams, for the $15 total here.
[291:37.01]Thanks, Jams.
[291:39.05]Quick, Jeremy, upload a video to YouTube to corner the market on this game.
[291:41.81]I mean, we... Somebody could.
[291:46.29]We all know the answers now.
[291:49.72]Corner the market on this video game that I'm sure not very many people have purchased.
[291:55.38]Thank you also for the $5.
[291:56.48]Don't give up, Jeremy.
[291:57.38]I believe in you.
[291:58.58]We got to the fifth room.
[292:00.50]I'm proud of us.
[292:01.66]I'm very happy about us.
[292:04.61]Yes.
[292:05.87]Yes, they're one and the same.
[292:15.10]Because you get a grandmaster of chess to come sit down and do what I did.
[292:20.40]He's gonna be like, I don't understand.
[292:23.00]I keep losing.
[292:25.00]So that's too hard.
[292:26.24]I can't go back and forth fast enough.
[292:28.76]I can't do this.
[292:36.09]Chess?
[292:37.75]He'll beat me.
[292:38.81]It'll be close.
[292:40.16]It'll be real close.
[292:41.76]He still might get the upper hand on me.
[292:45.14]Maybe.
[292:46.16]Depends on if I've had a good hearty breakfast of a couple of eggs.
[292:53.44]Chess brah.
[292:54.67]What?
[292:58.03]But thanks, dude.
[292:59.65]Thank you stay, Darren, for the $5.
[293:02.09]What is this game?
[293:02.65]It is Play With Me.
[293:04.23]On PC, on Steam.
[293:06.66]I do not recommend.
[293:09.18]But... I could... I see the appeal.
[293:14.71]I personally do not recommend, but I do see the appeal.
[293:19.11]It's a tongue twister.
[293:20.45]It's a brain melter.
[293:21.39]It's a brain buzzler.
[293:22.81]You know what I mean?
[293:25.16]And then stay there again for the 10 bucks.
[293:27.34]Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[293:30.20]Thank you, dude.
[293:31.78]Aquagrunt, thanks for the $4.
[293:33.06]That Overwatch bit was great.
[293:37.21]Oh, I'm sitting here thinking, what the hell is he talking about?
[293:39.17]I forgot.
[293:40.41]But yes, that was fun.
[293:42.13]That was a fun time.
[293:44.07]Thank you, Aqua.
[293:44.83]Appreciate that.
[293:46.23]I'm glad you thought it was fun.
[293:49.06]TechnoToast, again, thanks for the 75 cents.
[293:51.20]Local streamer gets scammed into kissing Donald Trump on stream.
[293:55.54]Scammed.
[293:57.40]And then StixRenegade, thanks for the 25 cents.
[293:59.36]Donating to the germa got scammed fun.
[294:02.63]Thank you for reminding me because I actually do have to cancel that if it's cancelable.
[294:06.53]I'm gonna be so fucked.
[294:08.93]To pay like seven, eight dollars a month for life.
[294:11.54]To talk like broken, screwed up, robot English Donald Trump for 20 minutes.
[294:19.02]And then grump clump right after that also with 25 cents drop in the container.
[294:23.15]Donating to the German got scammed fun.
[294:25.49]Thanks guys.
[294:30.75]Thank you, Pin, for the $1 here.
[294:32.21]Hey, Jeremiah, I recently decided to cut out Adderall in my life because it was causing me to have hypertension.
[294:39.01]Jesus.
[294:40.48]My work is suffering and I find it difficult to keep my usual productive schedule.
[294:43.64]My question is, how do you deal with your ADHD symptoms?
[294:47.12]Awesome stream.
[294:47.78]Build the wall.
[294:54.44]Thank you, Pin.
[294:57.71]It's actually very hard.
[295:01.45]uh but if you do cut that out of your life you know what I would highly suggest is I started to feel like a lot more what a turn no no he's not he's talking about I was doing if you're just here if you just you know everybody was already here I haven't done donald trump voice changer
[295:21.50]Um, actually, like, a better diet started to make me, like, able to concentrate.
[295:27.77]Even something as simple as having really, actually good food.
[295:31.71]Like, fresh, like, fish.
[295:34.91]Having, like, a couple of eggs in the morning.
[295:36.67]Coffee.
[295:37.09]If you like coffee.
[295:39.27]Coffee tends to scatterbrain people with, like, ADHD.
[295:42.04]But at the same time, you can focus on a lot of things, too.
[295:47.26]I would say... Coffee...
[295:50.56]Good breakfast.
[295:52.42]And do a little at a time.
[295:55.54]Because people with like ADHD, if you have it, you know that do everything a little at a time, but do it the best of your ability those little portions at a time.
[296:07.59]You want to eat like good like brain food.
[296:10.50]I'm talking like salmon.
[296:11.60]I'm talking fucking tuna.
[296:13.87]Don't listen to that mercury bullshit.
[296:15.73]Right?
[296:16.13]That's just the fucking meat industry.
[296:18.65]Trying to stop you from eating more goddamn fresh salmon.
[296:22.61]Omega-3s.
[296:24.22]Fatty acids for your brain.
[296:28.10]Don't listen to those.
[296:29.84]Eat fucking cheeseburgers and beef.
[296:31.94]Get out of here.
[296:32.64]Get that out of here.
[296:33.36]They're just trying to drive to fish market down in the toilet.
[296:44.83]But, honest to God, yeah.
[296:47.69]Diet is tied a lot, too.
[296:48.87]Especially sleep, too.
[296:50.95]Try to get yourself on a good sleeping schedule where you're waking up at the same time and going to bed at the same time.
[296:56.54]You wouldn't believe what that can do for you, mentally and focus-wise.
[297:02.86]It does a lot.
[297:06.78]I'm allergic to fish.
[297:07.68]Do you want me to die?
[297:08.73]No!
[297:08.97]If you're allergic to fish, then...
[297:12.16]Eat sardines.
[297:13.92]No, sardines are fish.
[297:15.36]If you're allergic to fish, then you should eat lean.
[297:19.34]I'm a big turkey guy, too.
[297:21.82]I'm less about the red meat and I'm more about the bird meat.
[297:24.51]You know?
[297:26.11]Turkey.
[297:26.49]Ground turkey.
[297:27.85]Here's what you do.
[297:28.59]Listen.
[297:29.43]Write this down.
[297:30.19]Get a pen and paper.
[297:30.99]Get a calculator and write this down.
[297:32.99]I got one right here.
[297:34.93]Go to the grocery store.
[297:36.45]If you got, like, a Whole Foods in your area, it's not that expensive.
[297:40.11]Uh, even if you don't have, like, a Whole Foods, go, if they do it, see if they have it.
[297:44.64]You want ground turkey breast and ground turkey thighs.
[297:49.28]Okay?
[297:50.56]Get, like, a half a pound of each.
[297:53.02]And what you're gonna do, you're gonna get, you're gonna get that back to your house.
[297:55.56]Ground turkey thighs, ground turkey breast.
[297:59.91]What you're gonna do is you're gonna get a little bit of olive oil on your hands.
[298:02.61]You're gonna do like 30%, maybe like one tiny little handful of turkey thigh.
[298:08.85]And then one big handful of turkey breast.
[298:11.73]And you're gonna mix olive oil on your hands, mash them up, mix them up, roll it around so you get like a 70-30 thigh to breast meat kind of ball.
[298:20.25]Squish it up.
[298:22.11]Next step.
[298:23.54]Punch that into your calculator, step two.
[298:25.46]After that, flatten it out a little bit, flatten it into your hands.
[298:29.64]Clap it.
[298:30.58]Right in the middle.
[298:31.02]Get a little well in the middle.
[298:31.86]You're going to grab a little bit of onion powder.
[298:34.32]Get it at your local grocery store.
[298:36.22]Sprinkle just a little bit.
[298:37.00]Not that much.
[298:38.02]Grab thyme.
[298:39.52]Sprinkle a little bit of thyme in there too.
[298:41.56]Finish it off with some garlic powder.
[298:42.94]Just a little bit.
[298:44.00]Not too much.
[298:44.60]A little bit of garlic powder.
[298:46.10]Keep.
[298:46.46]The whole time you want to knead this up.
[298:48.26]Knead.
[298:48.78]Knead.
[298:49.33]Knead.
[298:50.49]Get it to a good flat level.
[298:53.49]How to deal with ADHD.
[298:54.73]Eat food.
[298:57.90]And then, listen, write this down.
[299:00.27]This next part, it's imperative that you do this next part, okay?
[299:03.81]Flat.
[299:04.73]You don't want it to be a big, gross hamburger.
[299:06.69]You want it nice and flat.
[299:08.20]Roll it up so you can see the thyme, you can see the green, you can see the healthiness.
[299:12.52]Medium heat.
[299:13.64]Little bit of oil in the pan.
[299:16.34]Right in there.
[299:17.59]About three or four minutes.
[299:19.15]Flip it over.
[299:19.81]Three or four minutes.
[299:21.90]Bun.
[299:22.60]Pretzel of the pretzel variety.
[299:24.36]Pretzel bun.
[299:25.68]Cut it down the middle.
[299:27.03]Little bit of mayo.
[299:27.69]Little bit of handful of spinach.
[299:30.11]Little slice of Swiss cheese.
[299:32.31]Close it up.
[299:33.61]Don't touch it.
[299:34.37]Leave it alone.
[299:34.97]Don't touch it.
[299:35.47]Let it sit there for two minutes.
[299:36.86]Let the meat rest.
[299:37.68]Don't touch it.
[299:39.32]Do not touch it under any circumstances.
[299:41.10]And then eat it.
[299:51.61]And that's it.
[299:57.54]Quiet down.
[299:58.64]Quiet down.
[299:59.48]Somebody's telling me to quiet down.
[300:05.82]Are you like the neighbor over here?
[300:07.12]Are you like screaming out of your window at me?
[300:10.26]Like, shut up over there, you fucking idiot.
[300:12.93]Wouldn't surprise me.
[300:20.19]That was so funny.
[300:22.25]My neighbor screams at me for like this... ...stupid fucking food bit I'm doing right now.
[300:29.13]Imagine listening to me out of this window.
[300:31.64]Wow.
[300:33.22]I would think that this person was a psycho in here.
[300:36.40]Imagine walking your dog by this window and you hear some guy...
[300:44.61]I'd be like, that guy's fucking insane and I'm scared of him.
[300:47.23]I'm not letting anybody, I'm not letting my children near his house.
[300:51.79]He's screaming.
[300:53.29]I don't want my dog over there.
[300:55.49]I'm going to avoid this part of the neighborhood.
[301:04.02]Neighbor from hell.
[301:07.99]Letting meat rest inside the bun will make it... I was just kidding.
[301:11.97]You let it rest before you put it in there.
[301:18.29]Alright, let's move on.
[301:23.60]Thank you, Ben, for the 25 cents.
[301:26.48]Much appreciated.
[301:28.96]Donating again to the Germicot Scammed Fund.
[301:30.98]Yeah, I tend to.
[301:34.25]Ben, again, thanks for the $4.75.
[301:36.89]No message, just $4.75.
[301:39.47]$5 total there.
[301:39.89]Thank you.
[301:41.31]Leather Jacket, thank you for the $7.
[301:42.87]Thanks a lot, Leather.
[301:44.92]I shouldn't be promoting this kind of behavior, but this month's on me.
[301:50.92]Oh, God.
[301:51.48]Okay, now I understand.
[301:53.62]Thank you for paying for my cell phone app.
[301:59.48]Appreciate it.
[301:59.94]Thank you.
[302:04.88]Thank you to Wild Hub.
[302:07.18]Thank you, Wild Hub, buddy.
[302:09.82]For the 50 cents.
[302:10.44]Hey, Germa, I just checked out... I just cleaned up my couch and found 50 bits on the cushions.
[302:14.70]Here's to making the money back from that scam.
[302:18.48]Hope I do, too.
[302:19.64]In fact, I already have, so it's alright.
[302:21.86]Leather jacket already paid for it.
[302:22.84]We're good.
[302:24.50]Corbin Moon, thanks for the 50 cents.
[302:26.08]Is 50 bits enough to pay for the Germa voice app?
[302:31.20]The Germa voice app would be four voices, and you guys all know that.
[302:35.89]It would be this.
[302:36.49]It would be this one.
[302:38.95]This one.
[302:40.61]This one.
[302:42.15]And this one.
[302:43.49]It'd be four voices.
[302:44.19]Those are the only four voices you ever hear.
[302:46.97]I don't know if that'd be worth paying for.
[302:57.14]Two of those were the same.
[302:58.42]So you get it now.
[303:02.22]You're picking it up.
[303:05.14]The B.I.
[303:05.56]was at the end.
[303:06.02]Thanks dude.
[303:09.10]Thank you May's kit for the one dollar.
[303:10.44]You gonna be okay?
[303:10.96]People tend to ask me that shit, like... I know that's a joke.
[303:13.34]But you have to remember that, like, everything you hear on this stream is just dog shit.
[303:35.28]When I actually am being serious, I preface it by saying, you know, I'm being serious, right?
[303:40.95]Everything else is just dog shit.
[303:45.61]I'm gonna be fine.
[303:47.39]Or maybe I'm not.
[303:48.35]I don't know.
[303:51.23]I might fall down a well tomorrow.
[303:53.95]You never know what's gonna happen.
[303:56.57]I might get an ice cream cone tomorrow.
[303:59.30]and drop it, and on picking it up, a car drives by and the rear-view mirror takes my head off.
[304:08.33]What's the possibility that that's gonna happen?
[304:11.69]0.0008?
[304:11.89]Let's find out.
[304:15.55]If there are 50,000 cars on the road at any given moment, times the ice cream cone, I probably would have two in a week.
[304:23.97]So that's two divided by 52 weeks in a year.
[304:28.38]So, there's a 19% chance that I'm gonna get my head taken off by a rear view mirror.
[304:33.34]Side view mirror.
[304:33.98]There's about a 19% chance that, like, the side view mirror is gonna take my head off.
[304:53.43]Oh, I fucking love you guys.
[304:54.57]You guys are awesome.
[304:57.28]Thank you to NakNud for the $1.
[305:01.12]Can you say, Ethan is a nerd?
[305:02.76]Haha XD.
[305:06.98]Destroy that calculator.
[305:13.35]You drop every ice cream cone you buy.
[305:18.95]Yeah, I drop every single fucking ice cream cone I've ever bought.
[305:26.09]Oh, man.
[305:30.79]Thanks for the $1, dude.
[305:31.98]Thank you, Kyle, for the $1.
[305:33.80]Local streamer.
[305:34.40]Single-handedly starts World War III.
[305:38.10]Oh, dear.
[305:41.38]Only a couple more here.
[305:42.16]Fourth consecutive line.
[305:43.20]Thanks for the $15.
[305:45.84]Jeremy, you're a beautiful, wonderful man.
[305:47.39]Thanks for always pronouncing my name right.
[305:50.79]Hey, you're welcome.
[305:55.56]Thank you for the 15 bucks.
[305:56.32]That's a lot of money.
[305:56.92]Appreciate it.
[305:58.64]You've been around for a long time, dude.
[305:59.80]Thank you.
[306:01.98]Fig Newton Balls for $1.
[306:04.36]Any advice on getting happy?
[306:11.27]I mean, that's a fairly loaded question because we could sit here and talk about that for a long time.
[306:18.87]But what makes me happy might not make you happy.
[306:24.83]And internally finding what that is can be very difficult.
[306:28.94]Because you might think something makes you happy, but maybe it doesn't.
[306:33.52]How to get happy, though.
[306:36.94]I would say you gotta find something you like.
[306:42.87]And find people that are also interested in that thing.
[306:47.99]And just kind of try to make each other happy.
[306:50.13]You try to make your friends happy, make your family happy.
[306:54.76]Whatever that may be.
[306:57.61]But... We actually had a long... If you refer back to... If you go back to... What was the stream?
[307:04.14]We had a long conversation about this.
[307:07.74]Like a week or two ago.
[307:09.84]This was like a 20 minute conversation we had about like depression and happiness and all that shit.
[307:14.71]So... I would probably say... Somebody could link to that stream.
[307:19.61]I don't... I forget which one it was.
[307:20.95]It was from... Somewhere in December maybe?
[307:23.29]The end of... Or the beginning of January?
[307:27.15]We talked about a lot of interesting things there.
[307:32.71]But I wish you the best of luck.
[307:34.95]It was the relaxation stream?
[307:36.23]Okay, yeah.
[307:36.78]Tacoma stream.
[307:42.14]I remember that.
[307:42.58]Yeah, it wasn't that long ago.
[307:45.48]And then to wrap it up here at the end, Djembyman for the 25 cents.
[307:50.08]Hey, Dale, better show up to work tomorrow or it's your job.
[307:53.39]Donald Trump.
[307:57.13]Oh, by the way, just before we leave.
[308:05.92]This is still going.
[308:07.44]This has been... Now I know why I'm going crazy.
[308:10.50]And why I'm acting like a psycho.
[308:12.46]This has been playing in my fucking ear the whole time we've been sitting here.
[308:19.45]No wonder I started acting weird.
[308:22.27]This music is getting to my brain.
[308:28.41]Good night, everybody.
[308:30.57]If I... Shut it off.
[308:32.43]Shut it off.
[308:33.11]Shut up.
[308:34.37]Get out of here.
[308:38.04]So that's going to be it.
[308:39.70]I will see you guys, if not tomorrow.
[308:42.08]Again, I need to see how I feel tomorrow.
[308:46.64]But if there is a stream tomorrow, then great.
[308:48.74]If not, then Friday will be the day.
[308:51.53]I'll probably leave something here.
[308:56.63]I'll leave something here to say if it's happening or not.
[308:58.63]But two worlds is the next thing we're going to start.
[309:00.85]Two worlds.
[309:03.68]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[309:05.38]Thank you Moomins.
[309:06.06]Move right on before we end the stream for the two bucks.
[309:10.09]I try to absorb as much information as I can each day as well.
[309:13.23]I read a Bazooka Joe comic earlier today.
[309:16.51]And now I can't remember the last five hours.
[309:20.85]Well, thank you for the two bucks.
[309:21.85]Good luck with your Bazooka Joe.
[309:23.35]The worst, best cartoon ever.
[309:27.14]And MaisyKit, right at the end, another dollar.
[309:29.76]I'm making another donation because my internet shit itself for your entire response.
[309:32.60]Are you going to be okay?
[309:35.00]I'm going to be just fine.
[309:37.55]Good night, everybody.
[309:39.75]I'll see you all soon.
[310:20.23]you
[310:54.99]Oh, yeah.
[311:28.42]It's supposed to be laughing.
[311:48.71]It got fucked up.
[311:50.21]See you later.
[311:50.87]Good night.
[311:51.13]I love you guys.
[311:51.81]I love you.
[311:52.26]Good night.
