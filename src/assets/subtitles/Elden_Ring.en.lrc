[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.04]Hey.
[00:07.49]It's here.
[00:09.07]It's finally here.
[00:11.33]It's here.
[00:13.59]Let's freaking go!
[00:15.11]Let's freaking go!
[00:17.28]Hey guys.
[00:17.50]How you doing?
[00:25.06]You guys ready for Elden Ring?
[00:29.22]I am, I'm very prepared.
[00:32.39]I'm, I came the most prepared I've been to any live stream you've ever seen.
[00:42.45]Except for obviously like, you know, the event ones, right?
[00:45.52]This is the most prepared I've been for a gaming stream in six and a half years.
[00:51.58]I had a big salad with like olive oil and radishes and lettuce.
[00:58.90]I have a bunch of nutrients.
[01:01.18]I'm drinking a matcha powder vitamin B drink.
[01:07.33]It's super hydrating.
[01:09.01]This is the most prepared I've ever been in my life.
[01:13.87]This thing is probably 40 ounces, by the way.
[01:17.13]Oh, I don't care.
[01:19.34]Hey.
[01:21.28]That's not what you took.
[01:22.40]No.
[01:23.10]Get in here and say...
[01:25.55]Let's freaking go.
[01:26.47]What the fuck?
[01:28.47]This is the... Okay.
[01:30.63]What?
[01:31.29]This is like a huge deal.
[01:32.77]This is like... Okay.
[01:33.79]You want to know why this is a big deal?
[01:36.09]Have you guys seen the reviews for this game?
[01:38.65]This apparently is a like masterpiece.
[01:41.43]Like better than Bloodborne.
[01:43.86]I'm going to hold my reservations on this.
[01:45.30]I'm going to wait to give my kind of honest opinion on this game.
[01:48.96]But people are talking about how it's...
[01:52.51]It's like the Ocarina of Time of this generation.
[01:57.75]So, holy shit, that's quite an achievement, potentially.
[02:06.65]In a world of a lot of disappointing AAA releases over the last year or two, this is a big deal, if it's good.
[02:18.11]I have no idea what I'm going to play as.
[02:20.23]I know there's all these classes.
[02:21.79]I got a notepad here.
[02:23.07]I'm going to have like a notepad on screen that I can, because you're supposed to, you got to keep track of what you're doing because there's no quest markers or anything.
[02:31.18]But I've been looking forward to this.
[02:32.42]I liked Sekiro.
[02:35.96]But I didn't love Sekiro.
[02:39.42]I wasn't like a massive fan of that game.
[02:43.03]So if this is anything like the previous kind of Souls games, if this is like an open world Dark Souls type game, then I mean, I don't know what to tell you besides this could be the best game I've ever played.
[02:57.23]Bloodborne is up there at like number one or number two for favorite game of all time.
[03:00.53]If this thing runs at 60 FPS, is open world Bloodborne essentially?
[03:05.49]Open world Dark Souls?
[03:08.04]I have to quell my hype here, because you know I like these games, right?
[03:16.21]But, I don't know.
[03:17.57]I'm very excited.
[03:22.16]I'm incredibly excited.
[03:25.52]It's because Sekiro beat you.
[03:27.34]Yeah.
[03:29.92]Sekiro was really hard.
[03:31.98]It was...
[03:34.39]I remember the last boss of Sekiro was, what, an entire two streams?
[03:39.63]Or at least a full, like, six or seven hours straight.
[03:42.91]There was a point after, like, hour number four or five where I just... I was like, I'm not gonna finish this.
[03:50.58]This is not gonna happen.
[03:51.42]It will not happen.
[03:52.26]It absolutely will not happen.
[04:00.77]I'm not gonna waste any more time.
[04:04.33]The stream is ready.
[04:05.69]The game is ready.
[04:07.41]I think I'm going to start in offline mode because I really don't want to... I kind of want to enjoy the world.
[04:15.25]I don't want to get invaded.
[04:18.03]Ballsack500 is going to come and kill me in three hits.
[04:28.45]This is my opinion on the Ukraine.
[04:30.57]Yeah, I'll give you one small little thing that I just
[04:35.62]It's... It sucks.
[04:37.72]And it's really, really saddening to know that... I don't know, we're still doing this shit.
[04:43.50]People are still fucking killing each other and shit.
[04:45.80]It's... It's not fu... It's bad.
[04:49.20]And as much as I would like to sit here and tell you and talk about it, I just really hope that... I mean, I don't have to be the first person to tell you.
[05:00.15]But...
[05:02.87]I'm honestly going to just try to escape from it.
[05:04.71]That's the whole point of this stream.
[05:07.53]I'm sure a lot of you guys have been up pretty much like I was late last night.
[05:11.97]Kind of just looking over it, going over the whole situation and going like, what the fuck, man?
[05:15.65]What is happening?
[05:18.51]Obviously feel for the people of Ukraine.
[05:20.31]It's fucking awful.
[05:23.71]I just really, really hope this doesn't turn into something even more sinister and awful.
[05:28.66]But that's all we can do, right?
[05:37.56]That's all we can do.
[05:42.06]So without further ado, we're going to play Elden Ring.
[05:50.11]Here we go.
[06:00.69]I think a seven's fine.
[06:01.79]Seven's good.
[06:07.82]I think that looks good.
[06:08.96]This looks good.
[06:16.07]Yeah, I don't want to speak too much on it just because...
[06:20.13]Obviously, I use this stream as a way to escape myself.
[06:23.95]And I've made comments about that in the past during other kind of times of uncertainty and of real like kind of pain in the world and really shitty stuff happening in the world.
[06:35.45]So like I've made previous comments and statements that this stream is a place for me to get away from it.
[06:41.25]So that's how I'm going to treat it.
[06:47.17]What fucking class am I going to play?
[06:49.63]I tried to figure this out.
[06:53.43]I was desperately trying to think of what class I wanted to start with.
[06:56.76]I know that like all these, it doesn't matter, right?
[06:58.46]Because I was thinking this game has like magic.
[07:03.94]It's a magic game where like everybody has like spells and abilities and stuff.
[07:09.13]But also you can be a caster.
[07:11.53]You can be a straight up caster.
[07:12.23]You can be a caster.
[07:14.43]I don't know if I want to do that, because I don't want to beat Cheese Andy on my first playthrough.
[07:20.29]Because you guys know that with every one of these Souls games, there's going to be one magic move that you can get, like, halfway through the game, that will, like, two-hit kill every boss.
[07:28.28]Right?
[07:29.02]I mean, it's the first week the game's out.
[07:30.60]That's probably going to happen.
[07:35.92]Samurai... Alright, let me see.
[07:37.42]Show stats.
[07:38.60]Oh, that's better.
[07:40.32]Alright, where's just, like, the default... I thought that guy was actually naked.
[07:45.32]I was just like, holy shit, they really don't care, huh?
[07:51.19]Prophet?
[07:53.13]Alright, so let me see what these stats are.
[07:55.45]This is the Faith class.
[07:58.00]Right?
[08:00.56]Astrologer is the Sorcerer.
[08:05.75]Bandit.
[08:06.63]Arcane.
[08:07.61]Arcane is not, like, plus damage to any spells or anything, right?
[08:11.19]Do Samurai?
[08:11.79]Samurai?
[08:12.45]Alright, what are other streamers doing?
[08:13.71]Because I want to do the exact opposite of that.
[08:15.15]Because I want to be, like, Contrarian Andy.
[08:17.94]I want to be the guy that's playing the one thing that everybody else isn't.
[08:20.98]So when people scroll through the, like, 50,000 streams of this game, I can put in my title.
[08:26.16]Bandit Gameplay!
[08:27.84]And they'll come to my stream instead.
[08:34.21]I don't want to do the... No, I'm not doing this one.
[08:37.29]No.
[08:37.76]I want to start with a weapon.
[08:39.38]I don't want to start with the club.
[08:42.40]I haven't watched anybody.
[08:43.36]Okay.
[08:45.38]Prisoner.
[08:45.80]Prisoner is... Kind of like everything.
[08:53.93]It's intelligence, dexterity.
[08:56.69]That's kind of battle mage.
[09:01.13]What are the weapons there?
[09:05.03]prophet I don't really usually play the faith based uh stuff in any of these FromSoftware games I should I just be spell it I should maybe I should be spells should I be a sorcerer I feel like that's cheating though or should I just do vagabond which is just okay you just use sword and hit things do the confessor that's kind of cool but it's faith I don't really like to play faith
[09:35.07]I think Prisoner might be up my alley.
[09:37.37]As well as... No, not necessarily Samurai.
[09:42.05]Prisoner?
[09:42.53]Alright, I'm telling you.
[09:43.93]I'm leaning towards Prisoner, Astrologer, or Bandit.
[09:53.60]I can't decide.
[09:54.18]This is my first playthrough, too.
[09:55.73]Like, this is the worst part.
[09:56.85]I don't know what I want to do.
[09:57.73]Do a poll?
[10:02.50]Alright, we're going to do a poll.
[10:04.06]In the chat right now, because I would do any one of those three.
[10:08.25]We've got Bandit.
[10:10.15]We've got Prisoner.
[10:12.33]And we've got Astrologer.
[10:18.35]Again, prisoner is kind of like a battle mage.
[10:22.81]Astrologer is spells only.
[10:25.83]And the end it is, I think, like decks, like quick stuff.
[10:32.51]Maybe ranged, bows, daggers.
[10:36.86]What are we doing?
[10:39.52]This is unanimous.
[10:43.62]Leia's classic Sonic.
[10:51.85]Oh, that's cheating, because the guy has a... The guy has a... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:55.11]Back, back, back.
[10:55.49]How do I hit back?
[10:57.29]That's cheating.
[10:57.71]The guy has, like, a hat on.
[10:58.61]Yeah, the guy's got, like, a weird helmet on.
[11:00.95]That is actually cheating.
[11:05.97]Oh, no.
[11:06.55]They're picking the guy with, like, the hat.
[11:09.23]Like, the weird metal hat thing.
[11:16.54]That's probably what I was going to pick anyways, I'll be honest.
[11:18.50]Because I like casting spells, but I like swinging too.
[11:20.54]Alright, we're going prisoner.
[11:21.20]Let's go.
[11:22.84]A lot of dex, a lot of intelligence.
[11:25.30]Alright, let's do it.
[11:28.42]Please choose a body type.
[11:30.65]Type A or type B. What's the difference?
[11:35.71]Type A?
[11:39.05]Name.
[11:39.55]Ooh.
[11:40.55]Actually looks pretty cool.
[11:42.77]Name.
[11:43.37]Oh, we need a good name.
[11:46.21]Uh...
[11:50.29]Frogman Jr.
[11:52.05]I think this is going to be Frogman's Legacy.
[12:01.20]Didn't choose B. I don't know what B is.
[12:02.76]How about... Flash.
[12:15.69]Flash.
[12:19.13]That's like a Sonic OC character name.
[12:22.79]Um... Edward.
[12:27.75]Oh, shit!
[12:28.75]That's actually an awesome name.
[12:31.13]Edward is a good name.
[12:34.18]Yeah, I think that's perfect.
[12:37.84]Okay, that's a good... Okay, body type... Yeah, that's what I want.
[12:41.54]Edward.
[12:41.98]Okay, body type A or B?
[12:43.58]Okay, we're gonna go bigger.
[12:46.92]Age, we'll do... I always do aged...
[12:50.23]Oh, what's the point of that?
[12:52.31]Actually, I can see this better.
[12:55.41]So, intelligence... Spells are affected by dexterity as well.
[13:01.33]Dexterity is cast speed, I think.
[13:03.59]I did my research.
[13:04.36]Don't think I didn't.
[13:07.56]So, this build looks like you want to do... And I don't know what mind is.
[13:10.30]I think mind is mana.
[13:14.86]Keepsake.
[13:16.34]I mean, none of this really ever matters in these games, but let's find out.
[13:19.50]Lands Between Ruin.
[13:20.32]The gold Grace shining in the eyes of the people of the Lands Between used to... Okay.
[13:24.94]So, they changed the name of the experience stuff in every single one of these games, right?
[13:30.62]So, ruins is just blood echoes, is just souls, right?
[13:37.28]Anything that I should be getting?
[13:38.21]Golden Seed?
[13:40.57]It does matter?
[13:41.19]It usually doesn't.
[13:44.28]The golden seed washed ashore from the Lands Between.
[13:46.80]Said to reinforce sacred flasks.
[13:48.62]I don't even... I don't know what any of this is.
[13:51.16]Imp ashes.
[13:51.78]Hold spirits within.
[13:54.12]We need to face cam.
[13:56.70]You got it!
[13:57.20]Uh, cracked pot.
[13:59.46]I don't know.
[14:02.54]No, you don't... No, fuck that.
[14:03.66]No face cam.
[14:04.72]You guys, I'm not giving a face cam.
[14:10.05]Maybe if you're good.
[14:10.83]If you guys are good, then I'll turn it on.
[14:13.03]Only if you're good.
[14:16.84]And for certain throne items, two stone keys shaped like swords breaks.
[14:21.50]Oh, by the way, also, I have this, too.
[14:25.83]Like, I can write down, like, I found guy by tree in Anor Londo, right?
[14:32.81]Like, this game apparently has no help at all with quests.
[14:39.99]So, I need to be prepared to write some stuff down.
[14:46.15]Alright, Bewitching Brand.
[14:48.77]Originate from, I don't know, what is it?
[14:50.45]Five sacred branches charged with beguiling power.
[14:55.74]Five pieces of boiled prawn boost physical damage.
[14:59.68]Oh, physical damage negation.
[15:00.74]Okay, so this is probably a temporary damage reducer.
[15:04.16]Oops, I'm sorry, I just punched you.
[15:07.50]Notepad Andy.
[15:09.76]What?
[15:11.26]In case I need it.
[15:13.14]Dude, I have been told that this is...
[15:15.68]As hard to... This is like playing Monkey Island for the first time.
[15:19.39]Before there was a game fax on it.
[15:23.67]I need to be prepared to know where, like, the bubble gum, the shoe, and the combined stick and... And, like, tree branch go, okay?
[15:34.39]Like, I need to know what the fuck this happens.
[15:36.21]I need to know how this works.
[15:37.31]I need to be able to write this stuff down.
[15:45.85]do game facts not stop stalling this is not I'm there's no stalling here I'm trying to rip I gotta alright I'm picking the I'm gonna pick the crimson Amber medallion because like it's just the it's just your starting item it gives you a little bit more HP you take all this shit off anyways stalling imagine saying stalling in the first 20 minutes of any Dark Souls type game
[16:17.26]That's the whole point.
[16:17.93]You're supposed to make, like, a character and pick... Don't rush me, okay?
[16:21.63]Don't rush me through this.
[16:23.25]This is... I've been waiting for this game for 30 years.
[16:26.53]Okay?
[16:26.71]Alright, let's go with Aristocrat.
[16:31.74]Alright, Voice.
[16:38.06]Can I get a preview?
[16:40.40]Oh, Sample.
[16:41.82]Alright.
[16:48.37]I like this one.
[16:55.82]I think this is good.
[17:05.37]This is fine.
[17:07.95]Fine.
[17:08.35]Alright, hair and face.
[17:10.99]Graphics look great.
[17:15.31]A structure.
[17:16.23]Oh god, I'm going to be here for so long.
[17:18.09]I promise I won't be here for that long, alright?
[17:20.13]Because I want to play the game really badly.
[17:23.01]I think we're just going to do random.
[17:39.12]You sit here with a helmet on half the time anyways.
[17:43.75]How do I do the... Where's the random, random, random, random?
[17:48.09]It's gonna be two hours of this.
[17:49.23]No, it won't.
[17:49.85]I'll... Okay.
[17:51.38]I am gonna just do the one thing that I do in every video game.
[17:54.92]All we're gonna get to is the point where I get to the chin and the jaw and I make it big and huge.
[17:59.30]That's the only thing that you ever care about, that I ever care about with any characters I've ever made.
[18:04.79]Is just make the guy's chin big like Thanos.
[18:07.03]And that's it.
[18:09.55]That's a defining feature of every single character I've ever made.
[18:20.62]No, we need deep, like, no, right here.
[18:28.18]It actually kind of, like, looks like me.
[18:31.62]Wait, what did I- How did I do that?
[18:34.17]It's not- My chin's not that long, though.
[18:42.57]Alright, that looks good.
[18:43.51]This actually- This is what I feel like I look like in the mirror.
[18:47.66]Okay.
[18:47.80]Okay.
[18:57.85]Oh my god, that looks weird.
[18:59.07]I like it.
[19:00.19]Okay.
[19:08.54]Contouring.
[19:09.18]I kind of like that, except we'll go like this.
[19:17.01]Alright, never mind.
[19:17.51]I'm going to be here for a little while.
[19:27.22]Ah, hmm.
[19:31.01]Thinner?
[19:31.37]Thinner?
[19:37.13]It's shaggy.
[19:38.83]Oh no, it is.
[19:39.59]Mouth slant.
[19:43.88]Oh.
[19:52.90]That looks okay.
[19:54.70]Mouth protrusion.
[19:55.72]This is how far out the mouth is.
[19:57.06]Let's go... Right there.
[20:03.12]Mouth width.
[20:06.32]Pull it back.
[20:10.16]Oh, I'm sorry.
[20:10.64]I'm not going to do iPad photo booth guy.
[20:12.66]Nope.
[20:16.24]Or like every other filter on Snapchat.
[20:18.12]No.
[20:18.22]Nope.
[20:26.37]That makes him look a little too normal.
[20:27.50]Okay.
[20:35.14]This feels like what every history book depiction of a peasant looks like.
[20:39.46]Alright, let's do lip shape.
[20:53.67]Expression.
[20:57.34]What does the other one look like?
[20:58.32]What does sad look like?
[21:00.44]That's not really sad.
[21:01.48]How about this?
[21:04.10]Okay, I like that.
[21:17.97]I mean, is it funny?
[21:18.91]Yeah, but...
[21:29.94]Hold that back.
[21:34.04]Did somebody just say this guy looks like Ace Attorney?
[21:37.20]I didn't catch the whole message.
[21:38.38]What?
[21:38.60]This does not look like Ace Attorney.
[21:52.23]Okay, cheeks.
[21:53.19]This is where it's going to get fun.
[21:54.83]Alright, let's go all the way up.
[21:57.41]No, all the way down, like right here.
[22:10.25]Kinda sad now.
[22:11.11]Alright, I like it.
[22:27.72]He looks like he's like a hexagonal.
[22:30.04]Why is he like a hexagonal?
[22:34.65]There's not enough polygons on this guy's face.
[22:53.96]No, that's too easy.
[22:57.54]Not that ridiculous.
[22:58.36]I want him to at least... Okay, right there.
[23:16.09]I'm going to keep it for now.
[23:31.99]I'm going to keep it for now, but I can't promise it's going to stay.
[23:42.97]It looks powerful.
[23:47.96]It really does look like Shaggy.
[23:49.90]It looks like Shaggy went to the county fair and had one of those caricatures made where he's riding his surfboard on a wave.
[24:08.23]Or he's on a tandem bicycle with Daphne or something.
[24:22.21]No, that's way too much.
[24:23.72]That's way too much.
[24:25.50]We're pulling it back a little.
[24:33.56]This looks like a Joker.
[24:35.54]It does look like a Joker.
[24:36.58]Alright, nose height.
[24:43.13]No, it's not going to be the nose guy.
[24:48.45]That's fine.
[24:48.87]That's fine.
[24:49.25]I'm not doing anything else to it.
[24:50.93]Eyes.
[24:57.10]Okay.
[24:58.08]What's it?
[24:58.46]Up?
[25:02.80]Is this a Dreamworks character?
[25:07.17]It's like Coraline's dad.
[25:21.33]That looks okay.
[25:22.19]Thank goodness.
[25:28.87]I like that.
[25:29.65]I think that's perfect.
[25:40.52]I like the wide.
[25:42.88]Wide.
[25:45.36]Wide is better.
[25:48.66]Like right there.
[25:50.46]Maybe not so much.
[25:53.39]Like that.
[25:53.73]Alright, that's a really good start.
[26:03.31]Somebody said, Shaggy from Scooby-Doo after being hit with gamma particles.
[26:09.90]Like a Hulk?
[26:18.70]How about this one?
[26:23.12]Brow out.
[26:28.54]Alright, he's slowly turning into the bird from the Muppets.
[26:41.54]And I made that exact same joke the last time I played Dark Souls.
[26:45.55]So you better know I'm excited.
[26:58.71]Let's level it down here.
[26:59.83]I like that.
[27:02.86]Forehead.
[27:06.32]Big forehead or no forehead at all.
[27:08.26]Like his eyebrows go into his hairline.
[27:18.21]Forehead protrusion.
[27:20.55]Pull it back a little bit.
[27:21.33]Alright, height.
[27:28.46]Alright.
[27:34.29]Dude, my eyes are like this.
[27:37.41]I got this huge eyebrow bone.
[27:43.56]This just makes him sadder.
[27:45.12]Alright, fine.
[27:45.56]Alright, facial balance.
[27:49.34]Wait, what do you mean nose size?
[27:50.72]What?
[27:52.77]What?
[27:59.70]Uh, I'm gonna keep it here.
[28:05.76]Nose forehead ratio.
[28:06.96]Face protrusion.
[28:15.99]That's too much.
[28:16.85]That's too cartoonish.
[28:17.79]Like, right here.
[28:21.95]I actually think it's perfect.
[28:22.83]I don't think I need to do any more.
[28:26.19]We do have to do something about the hair, though, I think.
[28:28.11]Well, maybe the hair is perfect.
[28:32.56]Alright.
[28:34.30]So let's go with hair.
[28:35.46]What we got?
[28:47.41]Are you sure this is Shaggy with gamma rays and not Jerma?
[28:51.42]Jeremy with gamma rays?
[28:54.52]Because that's what I feel like I did.
[28:55.92]I feel like I just made me.
[29:04.98]I like that.
[29:06.80]I like that too, a lot.
[29:09.52]I like that way more than this one.
[29:15.14]He looks like one of the, like, quote, English band members in every fucking cartoon.
[29:25.17]He has a voice like this, guaranteed.
[29:26.65]Oh yeah, he's got a voice like this.
[29:28.73]Guaranteed.
[29:29.17]Alright, 12 is where we're at right now.
[29:33.67]Although this is really good too.
[29:34.99]I like this one a lot.
[29:40.82]Alright, 12, 13.
[29:50.85]This one's like too real.
[29:52.19]I don't like this one.
[30:01.89]Now, I think it's either 12 or 13.
[30:04.14]Alright.
[30:07.22]What do we think?
[30:11.46]Is it Cartoon English Band Member 1 or Cartoon English Band Member 2?
[30:20.97]12 or 13.
[30:22.31]I could go with either one.
[30:28.29]Yep.
[30:28.85]It's gonna be 12.
[30:29.29]It's gonna be 12.
[30:35.89]Oh, it changed.
[30:37.83]It changed from cartoon English band member to emo band member in one second.
[30:48.66]Oh, wait.
[30:49.42]Hold on.
[30:50.60]I gotta change that.
[30:51.57]I think it's gonna have to stay brown.
[31:03.21]I just, I just, I, this is, alright, this is just Criss Angel.
[31:09.11]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:11.41]It's English cartoon band member.
[31:18.62]I mean, I could go back and just make him a sorcerer.
[31:22.02]Change his name to Mind Freak.
[31:24.84]And... No, no, no, no.
[31:31.34]No, we're sticking with what I had.
[31:39.01]Or a kiss band member.
[31:40.03]Yeah, I mean... I'm going with this.
[31:44.59]Luster?
[31:48.49]Does it make him look shiny?
[31:55.15]White hairs.
[32:01.24]Not too many.
[32:01.86]Maybe a few.
[32:05.30]That looks alright.
[32:05.74]Make it more greasy?
[32:07.42]No, I'm not made it greasy.
[32:09.84]Eyebrows.
[32:12.53]You can't even see them, so who cares?
[32:13.61]Facial hair.
[32:15.55]Alright, this is a big deal.
[32:20.15]Oh.
[32:21.57]Alright, this is actually... Actually, this could be the one.
[32:27.23]It could be six here.
[32:34.50]I think it's six.
[32:41.77]Yep, it's six.
[32:47.21]Match hair, match hair, stubble.
[32:49.29]What does that mean?
[32:50.30]Oh, thick?
[32:52.00]Yeah, that's fine.
[32:55.26]Eyelashes, can't see them.
[32:56.74]Eyes, can't really see them, but I mean, whatever.
[33:02.54]You can't see these.
[33:05.62]You literally cannot even see them, so it doesn't matter.
[33:07.98]It doesn't matter.
[33:11.51]It makes eyes like green or blue.
[33:13.57]I don't know.
[33:15.13]It doesn't matter.
[33:22.24]You can't see them anyways.
[33:25.48]Orbs?
[33:26.60]Skin luster?
[33:31.19]Dark circles.
[33:32.61]You can't really see them.
[33:38.99]Make it greasy.
[33:39.59]No.
[33:45.29]You can't really see that anyways.
[33:49.45]Alright.
[33:50.96]Eye patches?
[33:51.62]No, you can't see this either.
[33:55.10]Eye patch.
[33:59.62]No, he's not getting an eye patch.
[34:05.84]Alright.
[34:06.74]I think it's done.
[34:07.56]I think we're ready.
[34:11.60]Now we need to do body.
[34:17.05]Wait, you can make him have a tiny head?
[34:25.19]Wait, should he have a small head?
[34:26.55]Where's all the body hair?
[34:37.25]I don't see it.
[34:37.67]Where is it?
[34:47.68]Yeah, body, hair, yeah, I don't see, I mean, it's kind of there.
[34:55.12]This is funny right now, but this is going to annoy, this is going to, I'm going to hate this in like an hour and a half.
[35:03.03]I'm going to hate this equally, right?
[35:05.63]It's too big.
[35:10.09]No, it's not.
[35:11.41]It's not Aaron Yeager.
[35:13.91]It's not Aaron Yeager.
[35:19.75]Okay, maybe it's kind of close.
[35:25.02]I'll give him kind of a big head because I want to be able to see the helmets because it's cool.
[35:29.26]Alright, that's fine.
[35:29.76]That's fine.
[35:30.02]That's fine.
[35:30.30]I'm done.
[35:31.22]Done.
[35:31.76]It's over.
[35:32.08]I'm done.
[35:32.32]I'm done.
[35:32.54]I'm done.
[35:32.76]I'm done.
[35:33.00]I'm done.
[35:38.05]Okay, save it.
[35:39.29]Was that it?
[35:41.91]Save to favorites.
[35:44.51]Save.
[35:45.53]Preset appearance.
[35:46.27]Yes.
[35:47.31]Okay.
[35:47.43]Okay.
[35:49.98]I think we're good to go.
[35:52.32]See?
[35:52.72]Look it!
[35:52.98]He's got the th- You guys made me do all this stuff to put this fucking helmet on him.
[36:02.80]Alright.
[36:02.98]Are you guys ready to go?
[36:06.16]Wait, what does he look like as other characters?
[36:07.78]Fuck!
[36:15.69]It's perfect!
[36:16.77]No!
[36:18.65]How many times have I said no in like 20 minutes?
[36:21.23]Relax.
[36:33.80]Oh, I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[36:36.20]I'm doing- we're gonna go with prisoner, but I'm gonna take the helmet off.
[36:42.62]Alright, are you ready?
[36:44.34]I'm ready to start Elden Ring.
[36:49.33]You may... That's just a titan.
[36:53.83]You can probably hide the helmet.
[36:55.89]Alright.
[36:56.69]I am ready to play.
[36:57.73]I've been waiting for this game for a hundred years.
[36:59.51]This is it.
[37:00.65]Let's go.
[37:01.27]Are you ready?
[37:02.31]Let's go.
[37:02.91]I'm fucking excited.
[37:04.11]I'm ready to go.
[37:05.33]I've been waiting for this.
[37:06.67]I'm gonna get a nice sip of my matcha green tea.
[37:12.36]Alright.
[37:14.22]Cutscene incoming.
[37:14.96]Let's go.
[37:19.68]Oh, yes.
[37:20.80]Paleblood, you say?
[37:24.53]Well, you've come to the right place.
[37:33.24]The fallen leaves tell a story.
[37:48.97]The great Elden Ring was shattered.
[37:56.00]In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.
[38:13.95]Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found.
[38:24.32]And in the night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was first to perish.
[38:34.49]Come on, Godwyn.
[38:36.51]New meme.
[38:37.43]New meme unlocked.
[38:39.45]Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.
[38:54.00]The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.
[39:04.63]Jesus.
[39:11.12]A war from which no lord arose.
[39:14.88]A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.
[39:33.95]Arise now, ye tarnished.
[39:38.11]Ye dead. who yet live.
[39:43.05]The call of long-Lost Grace speaks to us all.
[39:56.18]Hoarah Loux, Chieftain of the Badlands.
[40:02.57]The ever-brilliant Goldmask.
[40:07.99]Fia, the Deathbed Companion.
[40:13.88]The loathsome Dung Eater.
[40:20.18]And Sir Gideon Othnir, the All-Knowing.
[40:33.24]I have no idea what the fuck any of that was.
[40:34.78]I couldn't follow any of it, but the art was really good.
[40:42.02]And one other. Whom grace would again bless.
[40:48.42]I should be writing all this down.
[40:50.42]No, I got the notepad, but I'm not going to.
[40:51.99]Tarnished of no renown.
[41:01.69]Cross the fog
[41:04.51]The only thing you had to write down was Dung Eater.
[41:09.63]Alright.
[41:11.29]Alright.
[41:11.87]Let's go.
[41:35.40]Alright, new the ring.
[41:41.92]Okay.
[41:47.21]Whoa!
[41:48.49]Just like maybe, okay.
[41:49.27]What do we got?
[41:51.99]Let's test out the moves for a second.
[41:58.19]Oh shit, this guy's a fencer.
[41:59.89]I don't want to play a fencer.
[42:03.32]I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[42:04.82]I don't play- I never play with the fencing.
[42:09.55]Ever.
[42:14.51]Can I restart?
[42:16.49]Oh, this is bad.
[42:18.69]Raise the Elden Ring.
[42:24.10]I actually did not mean to rate that poor.
[42:25.84]I thought start was yes.
[42:28.84]I'm the one person.
[42:30.40]I'm such a contrarian.
[42:32.26]Well, I don't know that yet because I haven't played the game yet, so I'm not going to praise it yet.
[42:37.64]Dislike.
[42:38.00]Alright, tarnished wizened finger.
[42:42.58]Okay, what does that say?
[42:47.91]Will the path be broken and uncertain?
[42:49.71]Claim your place as Elden Lord.
[42:51.39]So I'm supposed to be a lord, alright.
[42:53.73]Be wary of message.
[42:54.99]Oh shit, I'm online right now.
[42:58.47]Is that bad?
[43:00.03]Seek life.
[43:00.69]Okay.
[43:02.05]I'm gonna play offline because I've... Wait.
[43:05.75]Look for secrets.
[43:11.96]Wait.
[43:14.38]There's an actual jump button?
[43:16.40]No, there's not.
[43:20.22]Five fingers butthole.
[43:21.32]Oh, yeah.
[43:21.84]Great.
[43:22.14]Thanks.
[43:25.30]What does this one say?
[43:26.06]Uh, try poop in face.
[43:28.64]Alright, so there's a jump.
[43:34.51]Sprint.
[43:35.85]Alright, let's go.
[43:43.01]Ooh.
[43:45.22]Whoa.
[43:50.12]Whoa.
[43:56.84]Chapel of Anticipation.
[43:58.48]What's over here?
[43:59.75]This door is blocked shut.
[44:01.11]Alright.
[44:01.65]Wait!
[44:02.41]Wait!
[44:07.98]Okay.
[44:10.16]With my mouse.
[44:23.89]Door next to spawn.
[44:25.05]Where am I?
[44:25.89]Door next to spawn is blocked shut.
[44:29.43]Alright, that's all I need to know.
[44:37.27]What do you mean cheating?
[44:40.83]No!
[44:41.89]What?
[44:42.73]If I was this character, I wouldn't walk around with a pen and paper or something?
[44:49.38]Guys, I had ink back in, like, the 1200s.
[44:51.16]Okay?
[44:53.76]There's nothing wrong with what I'm doing.
[44:54.87]Necessary item ahead.
[45:00.61]Is there actually... Can I go down this ledge?
[45:08.07]Why can I do this?
[45:08.71]I can walk over here for some reason.
[45:09.75]Why?
[45:09.87]There's nothing down there.
[45:21.19]What did you do?
[45:27.19]Everyone just walks off here and dies.
[45:28.69]Okay, I'm not doing that.
[45:32.29]I'm not going to have the first fall joke be an intentional fall joke.
[45:35.62]Alright, let's go.
[45:38.50]Camera controls, yep.
[45:40.12]First off, good luck.
[45:43.50]I keep saying poor.
[45:45.20]Start should be yes.
[45:46.26]Wait, what's this?
[45:47.12]What's that?
[45:47.94]What's down there?
[45:48.59]What's over here?
[45:55.09]Okay.
[45:56.33]You will fall, Joe.
[45:57.43]Yeah, but not like right now.
[46:03.12]Is there eluciary walls in this game?
[46:05.62]Raise the roll.
[46:06.24]Okay.
[46:11.73]This is really pretty.
[46:13.41]This is beautiful.
[46:19.33]Really?
[46:19.59]Can I...
[46:29.21]Well, there's a way to jump up the ledge.
[46:36.03]Is there a penalty for dying like in the other games?
[46:38.59]I hope not.
[46:40.98]Alright.
[46:41.18]Let's go.
[46:41.50]Let's go.
[46:41.74]Let's go.
[46:48.46]He actually did it.
[46:50.06]Well, they put a jump in the game.
[46:52.03]There has to be something over here.
[46:53.11]And I'm going to take my time.
[46:53.93]Retrieve log.
[46:56.09]Oh.
[47:00.68]Okay, FromSoftware doesn't just put stuff like this for no reason.
[47:05.80]Is this just here for no reason?
[47:09.24]I'm gonna miss something.
[47:12.48]Alright, don't die in the same spot again.
[47:19.34]I'm gonna try one more time.
[47:25.24]Alright, for what?
[47:30.32]What does this do?
[47:32.42]There's nothing, okay, there's no reason to do what I just did.
[47:34.24]Let's go.
[47:40.64]I like the compass, though.
[47:41.80]That's very helpful.
[47:42.44]Alright.
[47:49.93]Ooh.
[47:51.13]Alright, is there a champion Unger?
[48:05.95]What's his name?
[48:06.65]Ingir?
[48:07.97]Ingman?
[48:09.01]What's the guy's name at the very beginning?
[48:12.33]Amphion Bunger?
[48:13.13]No, no, no.
[48:13.53]What's the guy's name in the beginning of Dark Souls 3?
[48:19.44]Gundyr?
[48:20.46]What did I say?
[48:20.88]Ungir?
[48:21.20]Undyr?
[48:32.60]Not Bunger.
[48:35.60]Gundir.
[48:36.48]Gundir.
[48:37.30]Ungir.
[48:38.26]Undir.
[48:38.96]Whatever his name is.
[48:39.98]Alright.
[48:40.48]You're distracting me.
[48:41.68]Alright.
[48:48.50]There's nothing over here.
[48:49.18]It's just pretty.
[48:51.71]It really sucks that I have this fencing weapon, though.
[48:54.09]I have like this... This Dung Eater.
[48:58.15]Cool.
[49:00.75]Alright.
[49:00.97]Let's do it.
[49:01.77]Wait.
[49:01.99]What about over here?
[49:09.18]Barbecue, bacon, bunger, bunger.
[49:15.60]Nothing.
[49:15.96]I know.
[49:21.95]Completionist Andy.
[49:23.19]I know.
[49:23.55]But I need to see what's over here.
[49:25.15]I like the statue.
[49:33.81]Look, this is definitely a... Yeah, I knew it.
[49:36.49]I knew there was going to be a... I knew there was going to be a Bunger.
[49:39.23]I knew it.
[49:44.70]How do I cast spells?
[49:45.52]How do you cast spells?
[49:50.10]It's not that one.
[49:51.84]How do I cast spells?
[49:55.99]Not like that.
[49:57.67]I'm dead already.
[50:02.25]Oh, that's supposed to happen.
[50:09.41]I don't even have a heal.
[50:37.92]Ooh, that was a bad voice crack, but I'm very excited.
[50:50.73]It's the horse.
[50:51.99]Nice.
[51:01.45]Don't worry, Torrent.
[51:04.05]Fortune is on his side.
[51:08.38]We found him here, after all.
[51:22.37]One of his kind is sure to seek the Elden Ring.
[51:29.13]The Elden Ring is kind of a powerful thing, but you get it and you become a lord or something.
[51:32.49]It does violate the Golden Order.
[51:39.27]Unlike that, I would assume.
[52:00.35]I just realized this helmet never can come off.
[52:04.91]Your head can't come out of that hole.
[52:09.52]What?
[52:15.56]Blask of Crimson Tears.
[52:16.84]Alright, that's definitely the... Yeah, that's definitely the Estus.
[52:21.93]That's... Okay, there's... Just like in Dark Souls 3.
[52:27.23]There's the two... There's the magic one.
[52:29.83]The... Ooh.
[52:30.65]Ooh.
[52:37.42]Brave Tarnish, take the plunge of learning and remembrance.
[52:41.42]Oh, I was about to jump off.
[52:45.88]Recall the arts of war and your warrior's blood.
[52:55.80]Is that up there?
[52:58.48]Blood display.
[53:00.02]Wait, you can... Whoa.
[53:03.58]Wait.
[53:04.66]How do I do that?
[53:05.89]That was interesting.
[53:07.27]Impaling thrust.
[53:08.29]What does that mean?
[53:09.79]What?
[53:14.87]If only I had a pickle.
[53:18.65]You hold it.
[53:22.37]That's weird.
[53:23.31]That's kind of weird that it turns it off.
[53:26.39]Okay, if only I had a pickle.
[53:27.31]Whatever.
[53:28.52]Can't get up there.
[53:42.23]And go up.
[53:43.81]I don't think I'm gonna go down just yet.
[53:49.18]Tree thing.
[53:50.78]Behold tree.
[53:51.44]Praise the tree.
[53:55.06]Write that down.
[53:55.64]No, I don't have to write that down.
[53:57.46]Are you ready?
[53:57.92]But wait.
[53:58.62]Am I?
[53:58.88]No.
[54:11.13]Taking the plunge.
[54:14.42]I'm actually really glad that I accidentally just did that.
[54:17.02]Because I probably would have got hurt a lot.
[54:18.74]Okay, cool.
[54:19.34]I think I would have died.
[54:22.97]Alright, let me use my fencing thing.
[54:32.87]This is a cool looking cave, though.
[54:35.77]Sites of Grace.
[54:36.69]Resting at a Site of Grace will restore your HP.
[54:38.87]Yeah, so this is Bonfire.
[54:40.93]Restores flasks.
[54:41.73]Yeah, most enemies.
[54:42.37]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:44.81]Is there fast travel between them?
[54:50.28]Very little fall damage.
[54:51.50]Think secure.
[54:52.10]Oh, really?
[54:52.52]Okay, that's good to know.
[54:56.88]Pass the time.
[55:00.59]Oh, that's right.
[55:01.33]There's a full day and night cycle where different shit happens.
[55:08.49]Wow, okay.
[55:13.53]Alright, well, here we go.
[55:15.77]Rest the camera.
[55:18.73]Do I have a parry?
[55:20.11]I don't.
[55:21.59]How do I?
[55:21.95]Okay, that spells.
[55:22.95]Thank you.
[55:23.43]What's it doing?
[55:26.60]That takes a long-ass time.
[55:27.90]Okay, how much mana did that use?
[55:33.10]Is there a... Can I turn... Hold on.
[55:35.26]I know I'm going to break immersion here, but is there a way that I can just make it so it doesn't turn the HUD off?
[55:42.29]Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's on.
[55:43.51]Keep it on.
[55:46.38]Yeah, I much prefer it like this.
[55:48.80]Sorry for your immersion.
[55:49.94]What is impaling thrust?
[55:51.60]Why is it on my HUD?
[55:58.36]You can memorize sorceries?
[55:59.48]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:00.85]Must have a staff, uh-huh.
[56:05.01]Weapon art, L2.
[56:08.81]Alright, I see.
[56:12.09]I'm not going to use magic on these guys.
[56:13.31]Why would I?
[56:15.19]Yeah, I know how to play.
[56:18.13]I just... Okay, the tutorial did the thing, and I had... That's actually a really cool move, though.
[56:26.26]FromSoftware, why did you... Hold on.
[56:28.58]What are you doing?
[56:29.22]Okay.
[56:37.86]They're doing the thing.
[56:38.98]They're doing the pause mid-swing tutorial.
[56:41.86]What happened?
[56:44.50]Well, this is fucking beautiful.
[56:45.74]Who's that?
[56:48.16]I can do that too, you know.
[56:53.60]Is that gonna hit him?
[56:57.79]Oh, wow.
[56:58.25]That's good.
[56:59.15]Let's go.
[57:03.67]Yep.
[57:05.27]You have to drop something, right?
[57:09.06]Change the button prompts in the PC.
[57:12.92]I actually don't mind why being... I think it's okay.
[57:18.46]You went down the combat tutorial hole.
[57:20.58]And you're complaining about tutorial.
[57:22.44]No, I'm just kidding.
[57:23.21]I'm actually just kidding.
[57:29.57]Yeah, you can do it in two hands.
[57:34.17]Wait, what?
[57:35.95]I can't hold this in two hands.
[57:37.29]I'm going to hit him in the back.
[57:38.15]Oh, hell yeah.
[57:42.14]Swing.
[57:45.25]Swing.
[57:46.97]Swing at me.
[57:51.21]You dick.
[57:51.97]Really?
[57:59.34]Wait.
[57:59.62]Oh, I have... I do have a shield.
[58:01.10]Okay, cool.
[58:07.20]Swing at me.
[58:09.63]I always hate fighting the guys with those big shields.
[58:11.91]They're annoying.
[58:21.23]I definitely want to... How do I... Because I do want to hold this in two hands.
[58:25.89]Sometimes.
[58:26.23]Let me do that.
[58:27.93]Hold on.
[58:30.15]Yep.
[58:30.37]I know how to use the menu.
[58:31.07]What does this do?
[58:32.17]Use to write... Ah, I see.
[58:33.21]Yeah.
[58:39.98]Why an RB?
[58:45.11]RB, why?
[58:46.45]Oh, okay.
[58:47.05]Because it was just why in the other game.
[58:51.53]I'll tell you right now, that is going to fuck me up big time.
[58:54.86]But I'll get used to it.
[58:56.66]Let's go.
[58:57.74]Take the helmet off.
[58:58.48]No.
[59:09.16]Backstabbing?
[59:10.10]Dude, they brought backstabbing back?
[59:11.55]Are you serious?
[59:14.93]That's such a fucking shit thing that they brought back.
[59:16.75]That's so annoying.
[59:20.69]I really thought they were gonna, like, get rid of that shit.
[59:22.09]It's so annoying.
[59:25.41]Makes the game, like, so easy.
[59:35.99]Not missing anything right now.
[59:42.18]That was a -2 joke.
[59:43.68]I'm just kidding around.
[59:45.86]I'm very excited.
[59:46.82]Let me be excited.
[59:47.80]That's actually really good.
[59:56.39]Should I go down?
[60:02.94]Wait.
[60:03.74]No, this is... Okay, wait.
[60:04.50]This is where that guy was.
[60:05.96]The bow and arrow.
[60:08.44]That uses magic?
[60:09.42]It does.
[60:10.00]You're right.
[60:12.98]How fast is it?
[60:17.10]Crouch.
[60:18.62]Crouch to make it harder for enemies to discover you.
[60:21.23]There's a stealth?
[60:24.05]Wait.
[60:27.47]They added stealth.
[60:35.07]Wow.
[60:35.65]Okay, that's cool.
[60:38.14]That's really cool.
[60:42.88]So I'm imagining if you're in kind of like tall grass like this.
[60:53.75]Oops.
[60:54.93]Well.
[60:57.15]Well done, wolf.
[61:07.02]Ramped area ahead.
[61:08.20]Yep.
[61:11.04]I wonder what the, uh, the range is.
[61:19.02]Yeah, the stance breaking.
[61:20.10]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[61:20.64]You want me to go ahead and do it.
[61:21.78]Yep.
[61:27.90]Is there no jump attack with it?
[61:29.88]Usually it's, what, up and... You will never use stealth, I am sure of it.
[61:36.24]You can't be that positive about it.
[61:40.49]It's jump and right trigger.
[61:44.73]Oh my goodness.
[61:45.43]Okay, there's a dedicated jump button.
[61:46.55]That's right.
[61:50.54]They actually added a dedicated jump button.
[61:59.50]Tutorial boss.
[62:00.49]Soldier of Godrick.
[62:03.07]Let's go.
[62:08.00]Guard counters, yeah, yep, yep.
[62:10.47]Wait, you can perform a counterattack immediately after blocking an a- Wait, what?
[62:18.71]Is this in the other games?
[62:19.33]I trigger immediately after blocking an attack.
[62:25.57]Block an R1?
[62:26.05]What does that mean?
[62:32.92]Is it just a parry?
[62:42.21]This is just parrying.
[62:49.61]It's different.
[62:52.22]That and then right.
[62:53.58]I hear somebody walking around.
[62:54.62]Okay, cool.
[63:00.70]It's after you guard.
[63:01.80]Right trigger, not right bumper.
[63:04.62]Okay.
[63:06.69]Cool.
[63:10.50]It's a Held Block Parry.
[63:12.34]Does a shield even do it that I have?
[63:14.12]I feel like this kind of shield would not do that.
[63:17.64]Parry the Platypus.
[63:23.86]Shield will do it.
[63:24.52]Okay, I gotta figure, I gotta... There's the item I couldn't get.
[63:33.62]Strength, new.
[63:35.46]Nemo?
[63:36.01]That's it?
[63:38.81]You didn't do the voice.
[63:42.95]I actually need to practice this because it would be embarrassing if I get it wrong.
[63:49.74]Alright, well that was cool.
[63:51.98]Let's go.
[64:00.60]It's like, oh, parry the platypus.
[64:02.62]I'm going to take over the entire world, parry.
[64:05.36]No, it's me dolphin.
[64:06.46]But that was actually really, really good.
[64:07.86]And I would say that was probably the best one you've heard anybody do.
[64:12.27]I'm not sure that you could probably find somebody on Twitch right now that could do that better than what I just did.
[64:17.07]I have to give myself a little bit of credit.
[64:24.85]Well, I have the bonfire now.
[64:31.80]Use tarnished furled fingers.
[64:33.30]Yeah, this is co-op.
[64:34.58]I'm not going to be really doing it.
[64:40.38]What's this?
[64:43.25]Use stone sword key.
[64:45.72]Do I have one?
[64:49.27]Write that down.
[64:50.55]Whatever this is.
[64:51.03]I need a stone sword key for the bonfire.
[64:55.42]What's this place called?
[65:12.31]It is?
[65:12.67]Okay.
[65:13.33]Why is it so spaced out?
[65:20.59]Alright.
[65:25.81]Gamer notes?
[65:30.27]I always forget this stuff.
[65:32.25]And I never remember where it is.
[65:34.83]And I will sit here and I will beg you guys to tell me where the gargoyle statue was.
[65:40.05]And everybody was gonna laugh at me, and then you're gonna send me in a completely different place.
[65:52.34]Alright.
[65:54.44]What's this?
[65:57.96]Lever ahead.
[65:58.58]Yeah.
[65:58.92]You're blocking the lever.
[66:00.10]I can't even do the thing.
[66:02.32]Can't even... You're blocking it.
[66:05.32]I can't even activate it.
[66:06.10]Is that supposed to be happening?
[66:12.82]What a liar.
[66:13.55]There's no path here.
[66:20.75]Elevator.
[66:21.21]What about back here?
[66:22.77]Okay, let's go.
[66:33.38]You like video games or are you a liar?
[66:36.30]I'm playing a video game right now that I really like so far.
[66:40.46]We'll see after I die like five or six times to the first actual boss.
[66:44.40]And I tell you that like games aren't really for me anymore.
[66:47.02]And I'm like kind of done.
[66:54.01]Nothing here.
[66:54.47]Alright, let's go.
[67:03.35]Dude, that the feeling of wow, wow, wow, wow.
[67:08.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[67:18.55]Guys!
[67:23.89]Oh my god!
[67:25.43]This is unbelievable!
[67:29.19]No way!
[67:39.24]Look at the tree in the distance!
[67:53.27]I can just go anywhere now, right?
[67:54.60]That's the whole point of this game.
[67:56.06]Elden Ring, you can just do anything.
[67:57.56]This actually looks fucking crazy.
[68:04.50]Didn't expect gorgeous view.
[68:08.00]Look at that over there.
[68:09.28]This is insane.
[68:10.50]This is actually crazy.
[68:13.30]I'm gonna go around the back.
[68:24.63]What?
[68:24.95]Oh my god, there's more stuff over there.
[68:26.13]How do I get there?
[68:30.21]How do I get over there?
[68:30.73]I'm gonna go that way.
[68:32.43]This is gonna be so bad.
[68:33.33]I am controlled in FromSoftware games because there's only one direction you can usually run.
[68:41.22]But... This is gonna be a disaster.
[68:45.05]In every corner of the Lands Between you will find fruits and flowers, mushrooms and butterflies, and various other useful materials.
[68:51.64]There's a crafting.
[68:54.38]Grow a fruit.
[68:57.20]Dude.
[69:01.73]Wow.
[69:05.11]Those... Oh, those are hostile.
[69:09.23]These bald eagles?
[69:10.73]Wait, am I high enough level to fight these two bald eagles?
[69:14.75]Are they hostile?
[69:20.22]No, they're not, but do I need them for anything?
[69:28.37]I think I needed to do that for some reason.
[69:31.67]Foretoed foot?
[69:33.01]Oops.
[69:34.19]Oh my god, I feel so- I feel awful.
[69:36.19]I didn't want to do that.
[69:36.95]I was just testing my woof.
[69:38.37]I didn't want to do that.
[69:39.05]No, come- what about the- the- they were like friends, or... They were friends, or siblings, or lovers, or I don't know, one of those things.
[69:47.18]I'm really sorry.
[69:47.92]I didn't mean to do that.
[69:55.10]What is that?
[69:55.44]There's just random animals.
[70:03.14]What?
[70:04.40]Okay, this is crazy.
[70:06.14]I forgot where I was.
[70:06.88]Alright, let's go over here.
[70:07.78]There's a crab down there.
[70:19.01]Do I have the horse yet?
[70:19.85]Or no, probably not.
[70:27.26]Okay, so I don't see anything over there.
[70:29.40]Wait, there's more materials.
[70:34.47]Herd leaf flower?
[70:41.66]Somebody over here.
[70:42.26]I'm just gonna go this way.
[70:46.56]Wait, there's a person.
[70:49.38]Roots.
[70:53.66]What's that?
[70:54.54]What's that?
[71:00.52]Oh shit, there's a person.
[71:01.18]Okay.
[71:06.75]Guidance of Grace.
[71:08.35]Grace exists to guide the tarnished and lead them along the proper path.
[71:12.66]Even now, some sites of Grace retain that power.
[71:14.74]Their golden rays will guide you along your way.
[71:17.08]This is pointing in the direction that I have to go?
[71:23.04]That's it?
[71:26.28]This is just a person pointing in a direction?
[71:32.89]Use your map to check your current position as well as the terrain and surrounding structures.
[71:37.27]You can update your map with new information by finding map fragments at steels along the road.
[71:43.17]You can also use the map to freely place beacons of light to serve as landmarks.
[71:49.48]Okay.
[71:49.80]So you're going to find map fragments and you can place markers.
[71:57.86]Oh, Jesus.
[71:59.18]With the map menu, you can check your current position in terrain and buildings in the surrounding area.
[72:02.42]Mm-hmm.
[72:04.29]You can also place beacons of light to serve as a landmark.
[72:08.14]Lastly, for your map, you can select any site of Grace that you've discovered and traveled there instantaneously.
[72:17.65]Really?
[72:21.17]Oh my goodness, that's awesome.
[72:24.39]Cool.
[72:24.79]And it's pointing this direction.
[72:29.89]Are you getting this?
[72:30.99]I think I'm getting this.
[72:31.77]Alright, so what if I place a beacon over there?
[72:34.36]Does it show up?
[72:39.16]It does.
[72:41.76]How many can I place?
[72:42.48]Okay, you can place like step five beacons.
[72:48.34]How do I remove these?
[72:51.59]Alright, I'm going to have to write down like beacon one.
[72:56.91]Cheshire Terrest.
[72:57.77]Can't open yet.
[72:58.51]This is going to be the best game I've ever made.
[73:02.38]Okay, let's go.
[73:05.26]Oh, yes.
[73:07.49]I told you someone was gonna do it
[73:37.03]What?
[73:37.47]Why do you say that?
[73:38.03]That guy's scaring me back there.
[73:52.25]Take care to listen.
[73:54.51]Are you familiar with Grace?
[73:57.46]The golden light that gives life to you, Tarnished.
[74:02.36]You may also behold its golden rays, pointing in a particular direction at times.
[74:08.62]This is such a good looking game, too.
[74:10.26]That is the guidance of Grace.
[74:14.03]A path that a Tarnished must travel.
[74:17.97]I'm so excited!
[74:19.89]Indeed.
[74:20.69]Relax.
[74:23.11]The path you're meant to follow.
[74:28.84]So, okay.
[74:32.10]Wherever this thing is pointing is where my current objective is.
[74:34.86]L plus ratio plus maiden list.
[74:44.72]Touch Grace.
[74:50.28]Yep, it's okay.
[74:54.56]The Grace.
[74:55.10]We gotta get Grace.
[74:56.08]Alright.
[74:57.74]Do you do anything else?
[74:59.50]Is this a vendor or something?
[75:01.68]Should I just literally go back behind this guy and shove my sword through the back of his neck through his throat?
[75:07.61]You might watch other streamers that play these games one way, but I kill every NPC.
[75:11.15]I don't know, a lot of new viewers might not know that.
[75:13.87]I kill every single NPC and my character stays at like level 4.
[75:17.90]And then I quit the game in like 2 hours, so if that's what you don't want, then... Actually, just kidding, don't leave, because people are probably just like, oh, fuck this guy, and they left.
[75:25.52]Don't click the X yet.
[75:26.72]I'm kidding.
[75:28.70]I beat Sekiro on stream, and it was a fun game.
[75:31.22]Let's go.
[75:33.68]Alright, we're going to go that way.
[75:34.52]I've got to fight this guy.
[75:35.90]Very obviously, the guy on the horse.
[75:38.84]What is this?
[75:40.32]Summoning pools?
[75:43.56]In each area, you may find effigies of martyrs.
[75:46.80]These effigies are summoning pools.
[75:48.85]You'll find it easy to summon other players at these locations.
[75:52.97]As co-op and hostile summoning signs created... Okay.
[75:55.43]This is like the summoning zone.
[75:56.87]I don't need it.
[76:02.71]There's only one boss that I ever summoned.
[76:06.07]And that was the big dragon from Dark Souls 3.
[76:08.79]That we Mario-partied and beat it.
[76:12.31]I'm saying that anybody remembers that.
[76:13.97]The channel had, I think, 1,500 concurrent viewers when I played that game.
[76:18.31]Why am I saying, do you guys remember that?
[76:19.43]Maybe some of you do.
[76:21.29]Alright.
[76:22.73]I'm going to shoot this guy.
[76:24.51]Let's go.
[76:29.63]I didn't miss?
[76:35.55]I sneak up and backstab?
[76:41.51]Free Sentinel.
[76:42.39]Alright, let's go.
[76:47.20]What the fuck just happened to the game?
[76:52.16]Why is the game like slowing up and speeding up?
[76:53.93]What the fuck is that?
[77:06.16]30-90.
[77:06.54]The game, like, slowed down and then sped up and then slowed down again.
[77:11.70]Alright.
[77:13.14]Upon dying, you'll be revived at the last site of Grace that you visited.
[77:15.82]It will drop any runes.
[77:18.80]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[77:19.42]If you die again, they're gone.
[77:22.14]Compass will show you where your body is.
[77:23.51]That's actually really helpful.
[77:28.67]That was weird.
[77:29.87]Is that the kind of bugs that people were talking about?
[77:31.55]Those, like, video problems?
[77:34.98]Well, hopefully that's not that prevalent because that kind of sucks.
[77:42.32]You can jump?
[77:42.88]Whoa, dude, what the fuck?
[77:51.09]That actually is like hard to play with.
[78:05.35]Alright, come here.
[78:05.77]Did I get it?
[78:14.85]I didn't hit him.
[78:21.59]Oh shit.
[78:21.87]I don't think I can fight this guy right now.
[78:22.99]I think he's too hard.
[78:23.47]Maybe not.
[78:33.80]Way too long!
[78:41.20]Is this hitting him?
[78:41.80]I can't even tell.
[78:45.00]Yeah, he is.
[78:50.41]Fuck.
[78:52.77]I fucking hate the stupid fencing weapon!
[78:55.13]Alright.
[78:57.69]Breathe.
[79:00.59]Wait, wait, what was the comment?
[79:01.57]Lower the graphics settings.
[79:05.12]Is that- Should I actually do something?
[79:06.98]To help that?
[79:11.72]Yeah, so, like, every so often the game will, like, slow speed up.
[79:17.64]Is there something I should turn off?
[79:22.75]Turn off auto-adjust in settings.
[79:24.41]Oh, okay.
[79:33.49]Advanced settings.
[79:34.81]Oh, I didn't know it was right there.
[79:37.43]Auto-detect?
[79:39.10]Off?
[79:44.41]No, no.
[79:44.75]Auto adjust.
[79:45.67]Where is it?
[79:50.81]Is that what you mean?
[79:55.95]Or is it a different one?
[79:59.01]There's bullet time.
[80:01.46]It's the auto detect.
[80:02.36]Yeah.
[80:06.82]It's not in here too, right?
[80:08.02]Motion blur.
[80:08.92]No.
[80:10.38]Let's see if that helps.
[80:12.69]I mean, it only really happens in the first, like, 10 seconds, 20 seconds of a fight, but that's still kind of horrible.
[80:23.38]I can kill this guy.
[80:23.94]Let's go.
[80:25.68]Although, I'm just going to be, I think I'm just going to cast at him.
[80:36.17]Should I pull him somewhere else?
[80:37.01]I mean, the game's too pretty.
[80:37.81]Alright, let's go.
[80:57.64]What the?
[80:58.12]Oh, that's bad.
[80:59.42]That actually is why I got hit.
[81:10.63]Back it up.
[81:16.97]Oh!
[81:21.28]Fuck, he gave me one hit.
[81:23.48]Ah.
[81:26.14]Shit.
[81:29.86]Oh, that makes the game even harder.
[81:32.38]So that's what they wanted to make the game more difficult.
[81:36.48]I'll turn the graphics down.
[81:44.20]What do you think is doing it?
[81:46.22]I wonder.
[81:46.54]Reflection quality?
[81:51.69]Shadow quality?
[81:58.39]Is this AO?
[81:58.97]Try that.
[81:59.95]Alright, it's on medium.
[82:02.19]Oh, but look, it's ugly now.
[82:03.19]Let's see if that does anything.
[82:20.02]Fight him up on the higher hills.
[82:21.28]Don't fight him down here.
[82:30.77]Whoa.
[82:32.38]Oh no.
[82:36.00]Is that coming through?
[82:36.56]Are you guys seeing that too?
[82:37.90]Or is that only coming through on my screen?
[82:47.03]Do I fight him over here?
[82:47.91]Let's try it.
[82:52.37]That feels a little better.
[83:04.23]Yeah, that feels much better.
[83:08.27]I waited way too long to swing!
[83:28.92]Yeah, that feels a million times better.
[83:34.33]Oh, I'm out of MP.
[83:35.99]Whoa!
[83:42.94]Oops.
[83:44.18]Oops!
[83:47.28]Come on, cheese Andy!
[84:14.60]What's that?
[84:15.84]What does that mean?
[84:37.32]Yeah!
[84:39.77]I'm out of magic ammo!
[84:41.85]Fuck.
[84:42.25]Okay, I gotta pay attention to that.
[84:43.82]I gotta pay more attention to that.
[84:51.38]What, it's left bumper in circle?
[84:53.26]Okay, I got it.
[85:07.64]Oh my god, I suck.
[85:21.67]Alright, so I gotta fight him up there.
[85:23.41]Alright, I get it.
[85:24.38]He was doing this weird shield move.
[85:25.68]I got it.
[85:30.82]It's... Y and right bumper is to do that.
[85:35.40]Okay, I got it.
[85:38.36]I got him out of half.
[85:42.99]Get more mana flasks.
[85:45.71]I got this.
[85:46.29]I got this.
[85:47.13]We don't need to level up.
[85:47.87]I don't have to do shit.
[85:49.43]I got this.
[85:51.84]Get better magic ammo.
[85:52.86]Alright, I got this, I got this, I got this.
[85:53.90]I gotta fight him up here, though.
[86:00.49]This is awesome.
[86:03.67]This is really good.
[86:05.05]I'm really- Oh my god, I can't wait to play this.
[86:08.39]Is it funny when you feel like that when you're already playing the game?
[86:10.57]Alright, yeah.
[86:13.13]That stuttering is kind of a problem, but I'm willing to look over it.
[86:25.45]Okay, I gotta go this way Remember this is called buyer's remorse what this is fantastic.
[86:44.67]Oh Hold on get that V-sync
[86:57.80]I mean, when I fought him over here, it was fine.
[86:59.46]There's another bonfire there.
[87:04.08]Alright.
[87:04.82]I'm going to do that bonfire because it's like right... That's really close.
[87:10.01]Screen mode is put it on exclusive full screen.
[87:13.03]Not borderless window.
[87:15.21]I think that'll help.
[87:18.27]Then I can't easily tab over to my notes.
[87:25.97]It might help it.
[87:26.55]Let's see.
[87:31.78]That... That changed.
[87:33.98]That's weird.
[87:36.00]What happened here?
[87:36.52]Uh-oh.
[87:55.55]Oh shit, okay.
[87:58.77]See if that helps.
[88:04.90]I have a 1440p monitor, yeah.
[88:08.76]Put it in offline mode?
[88:10.74]Let's see if that does anything.
[88:11.96]We're gonna try it until I get it right.
[88:13.33]Let's see if I can get it.
[88:20.43]Alright, everyone quiet!
[88:26.47]I have an idea.
[88:27.09]I didn't know he could- Wait, what?
[88:39.48]He's stringing three moves together.
[88:40.60]What the fuck are these moves he's doing?
[88:42.26]He's just stringing shit together now.
[88:54.37]Oh my god, dude.
[89:02.35]Alright, alright, alright.
[89:07.14]I don't think it happened there though.
[89:08.68]I think the full screen thing fixed it.
[89:10.86]This guy's OP.
[89:14.64]What?
[89:14.90]Oh, I didn't touch the thing.
[89:15.78]Alright.
[89:17.12]Alright, my plan is I want to try to bring him down to like half health without using magic.
[89:21.07]And then just dodge around and use the magic and kill him.
[89:24.89]Can you parry that?
[89:25.81]I...
[89:32.56]I need the horse.
[89:43.73]Game slowed down.
[89:44.43]Alright, that didn't fix it, by the way.
[89:57.70]I probably can come back and kill this guy, but I'm so obsessed with beating him.
[90:14.09]You only have 12 gigs of RAM?
[90:15.71]I have way more than 12 gigs of RAM.
[90:22.24]Alright, I'll... Fuck, it's still happening.
[90:25.32]I'm gonna go... I'm not gonna fight this guy right now.
[90:33.09]I don't think there's a way I can fix it.
[90:46.09]Um... It's just this area?
[90:49.57]Well, then I'm gonna... Let me play the way that I was playing before then.
[90:52.21]Because I want the borderless window.
[90:54.47]Because that didn't fix anything.
[91:07.37]And then... Turn the quality back up.
[91:13.42]Turn this up to high.
[91:15.90]Okay, let's go.
[91:21.76]Oh, right.
[91:22.12]Put it back at 1440.
[91:23.20]Yeah, can I even do exclusive foes?
[91:30.05]1440.
[91:31.03]Alright, that looks better.
[91:34.79]Alright, I'm just gonna... I'll come back to him later.
[91:46.92]This is actually a very common bug with an easy fix.
[91:48.56]Simply close the program and wait for the devs to finish the game.
[91:50.89]Oh shit.
[91:52.93]I thought you had an actual solution.
[91:54.31]Alright, through your map you can instantly travel to any sites of Grace that you've discovered.
[92:06.45]Yep.
[92:08.48]Very cool.
[92:12.54]Go offline.
[92:14.72]Can I do that from the menu?
[92:22.35]Play offline.
[92:23.59]I think I have to restart the game.
[92:25.73]I don't think that's the problem, though.
[92:26.91]I think it just is a current bug in the PC version.
[92:30.79]Strengthening.
[92:31.71]At a smithing table, you can spend runes and smithing stones to strengthen your armaments.
[92:36.98]Somewhere in the Lands Between you may meet a blacksmith.
[92:38.96]Yeah, yeah.
[92:39.44]Okay.
[92:39.78]Cool.
[92:41.60]Smithing Stone.
[92:42.20]That's just like the Titanite shards.
[92:49.90]Yep, yep, yep.
[92:55.10]I don't want to upgrade this dumbass weapon.
[92:56.68]Zvender?
[92:57.06]Cool.
[92:57.20]Okay.
[92:59.92]Ooh, what do you got?
[93:00.32]Throwing dagger.
[93:02.06]Telescope.
[93:26.79]Finger remedy.
[93:27.77]Cracked pot.
[93:29.27]Crafting kit?
[93:31.94]I don't have any souls.
[93:33.12]They're all gone.
[93:34.80]Cookbook?
[93:36.48]Oh man, this is cool.
[93:37.90]Okay.
[93:44.73]Cool.
[93:51.95]You only have four bitcoins.
[93:54.65]That's not what that is.
[93:55.41]I gotta get my souls back I don't want to fight this guy.
[94:09.20]I just want to pick up the souls that are on the ground over there No get away from me
[94:21.14]I don't fucking have any.
[94:22.19]What the fuck?
[94:24.41]Alright, I'm just gonna go.
[94:25.69]I'm gonna go towards the great rainbow thing.
[94:29.55]And just play.
[94:39.96]Wait, what's over here?
[94:40.54]I'm gonna explore a little.
[94:57.84]Remember, I'm tired of your behavior.
[94:58.99]I didn't do anything.
[95:04.69]Was it a no?
[95:07.07]No door ahead.
[95:07.87]Okay.
[95:15.15]Did I discover anything?
[95:20.12]Will I remove the fog of war on the map if I discover stuff?
[95:35.33]Oh, Jesus.
[95:39.41]Those, those are penguins.
[95:46.04]What?
[95:46.32]Why is it every animal on Earth here?
[95:47.80]Is this such a regular enemy or is this a boss or something?
[95:58.05]Um.
[95:59.65]Uh.
[96:12.11]Oh man, I'm not supposed to be down here.
[96:38.44]Oh, he's so slow.
[96:46.74]He's got a big sword on his back.
[96:47.84]I thought he was gonna go faster!
[96:57.17]You know what?
[97:02.23]Oh no.
[97:06.79]It's alright.
[97:07.25]It's okay.
[97:07.69]It's okay.
[97:12.03]Holy shit!
[97:14.35]Oh my god!
[97:18.77]No, where are just like the little shitty skeleton enemies?
[97:26.53]It's just big scary people.
[97:28.13]Alright.
[97:39.35]You're dying to trash mobs.
[97:43.53]This is crazy.
[97:44.43]This is just everywhere.
[97:45.57]Alright.
[97:46.17]I gotta find like a bunch of shitties.
[97:50.67]I'm going to follow the Grace of whatever this is.
[97:53.92]I feel like I'm missing a couple of important items maybe.
[97:57.60]I need the horse.
[97:58.80]I don't have the horse yet.
[98:06.33]It's all so much to take in.
[98:07.97]This is insane.
[98:09.57]I'm going to be playing this for a long time.
[98:13.83]He hasn't killed a single enemy since the tutorial.
[98:16.09]Well, I've only seen two enemies.
[98:18.17]Huge guy with huge sword and huge guy on huge horse.
[98:21.96]I haven't fought a guy with a torch in his hand.
[98:24.60]This is the first guy that's just a regular dude with a torch in his hand.
[98:27.52]I'm going to kill him and he's not going to do any points of damage.
[98:37.37]I've only fought huge guys.
[98:38.97]Okay.
[98:57.61]Very nice Lucreys The stealth is actually a really cool mechanic
[99:21.98]Is a patch out to help with optimization issues?
[99:23.94]I think that probably... That's the day one patch, right?
[99:26.26]I think that already came out.
[99:45.86]Alright.
[99:48.26]I'm gonna... There's a little bit of stuff to explore over here.
[99:50.22]I'm gonna keep acquiring materials.
[99:54.51]What's the backstory for your character?
[99:56.52]Oh, I don't know.
[99:57.00]Yes.
[99:57.72]We'll play that song.
[99:58.56]Oh, yes.
[99:58.90]We'll play.
[100:00.14]That's it.
[100:04.70]Rune fragment?
[100:14.67]I wonder what these... Oh, I was going to say, what are these little skulls?
[100:19.90]Rune fragments.
[100:20.52]Rune fragments.
[100:21.22]Cool.
[100:22.20]What's up here?
[100:28.68]Okay.
[100:30.54]I'm going... Alright.
[100:31.16]I think this is the... This is the destination right here.
[100:32.98]I'm going to put a marker here.
[100:37.58]Because that's... I'm trying to go that way.
[100:44.93]What's making that sound?
[100:45.59]You hear that... What the hell is that?
[100:47.15]What the hell is that?
[100:58.40]Teardrop Scarabs.
[101:00.22]There are both Crimson and Cerulean Teardrop Scarabs.
[101:04.88]Feed them to replenish the flasks that match their type.
[101:09.50]What?
[101:09.92]Replenish the flasks?
[101:14.42]Something else I'm noticing too is... What's going on with the stamina bar here?
[101:19.13]I don't... I'm not using stamina.
[101:26.60]That's interesting.
[101:27.40]It just refills your Estus, okay.
[101:32.50]It only happens in combat.
[101:33.92]Okay.
[101:36.10]This is where I need to go, but... Alright, let's just see what happens.
[101:38.64]That is so pretty.
[101:44.92]It refills.
[101:45.62]So I don't have to go to, like, a bonfire.
[101:46.72]That's kind of cool.
[101:53.40]Gatefront Ruins.
[101:54.86]Oh.
[101:56.79]Alright.
[101:57.51]Wait.
[102:01.31]Alright, I... The dog didn't... I didn't hit the dog?
[102:19.81]I'm playing this on hard mode for myself because I sincerely hate the fencing weapons.
[102:25.28]It's a challenge.
[102:26.18]I'm for it.
[102:35.22]Oh, they're fast.
[102:41.11]Get a new weapon?
[102:41.71]I will.
[102:43.13]Thin beast bones.
[102:49.13]The crafting seems pretty cool, too.
[102:50.61]I'm really interested in how that plays out.
[102:51.65]I'm gonna stealth.
[102:52.28]What the fuck am I doing?
[103:01.79]I'm not a fan of this game.
[103:02.65]You know why?
[103:03.05]Because like I can't go over there and hold my binoculars up and just scan and just have like seven or eight squares show up.
[103:12.25]Like I know exactly where they are.
[103:19.82]Oh, what's with that?
[103:20.78]Come on.
[103:26.32]Oops.
[103:31.56]You can't block.
[103:32.32]You can't block magic.
[103:40.83]Can you?
[103:42.17]No, you can't.
[103:48.97]I'm going to forget to stealth a lot of these times, too.
[103:51.69]Oh, boy.
[103:52.07]Look at that guy.
[103:53.15]I think I can kill that guy in one hit.
[103:54.02]Anybody else over there?
[104:01.24]What?
[104:02.04]No way!
[104:02.52]How did you... How did you even see what I was doing?
[104:04.02]I went right by his ass.
[104:10.57]Come on.
[104:15.45]Ah!
[104:17.57]Ah!
[104:30.54]Watch out, a guy coming down.
[104:36.61]Come on!
[104:38.21]Come on!
[104:43.37]That's an alarm system!
[104:44.37]That's an alarm system!
[104:45.71]That's an alarm system!
[104:47.39]Uh-oh.
[104:50.20]Uh-oh.
[104:50.64]Oh, no!
[104:51.56]Okay, that's not... That's really bad.
[104:53.94]That's really bad.
[104:54.54]That's the entire camp.
[104:57.32]Um, I don't think I can get... I don't think I can get out of this.
[105:02.52]Hold on.
[105:02.88]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[105:05.63]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[105:11.77]They got something back here.
[105:12.51]I'm going to open the chest and leave.
[105:16.56]You guys have to have some bullshit over here, right?
[105:17.92]What is this?
[105:20.06]Map.
[105:27.88]This is a stupid idea.
[105:29.54]I'm just gonna leave.
[105:31.16]What is that?
[105:31.50]That's my marker.
[105:38.20]Just like taking all that food.
[105:40.28]Wait, I think I despawned everybody.
[105:47.59]Remind me, can you parry people with a spear?
[105:51.29]I forget.
[105:52.25]Dark Souls.
[105:59.47]I think you can.
[106:08.75]I got no magic left in this thing.
[106:16.31]Come on.
[106:22.83]Open up.
[106:23.75]Open up.
[106:27.98]Fine.
[106:28.34]I'll just kill you.
[106:34.29]It's fine.
[106:34.75]I'm going to thin him out.
[106:35.37]I'm going to take out the whole camp so I can just walk around and collect whatever I want.
[106:41.59]Still no giant.
[106:43.78]Oh, that's where it wants me to go.
[106:44.82]I'm not done with this place yet, though.
[106:46.90]We're going to go through and we're going to stealth kill all these people.
[106:49.90]Watch this.
[107:13.56]Nobody else here, right?
[107:18.31]He hates jumping.
[107:19.33]It's such a new concept to me in these games.
[107:21.61]I have to get used to it for a while.
[107:26.06]The fact that jump, like just regular jump exists, it's going to take a minute.
[107:36.28]Sekiro had jumping.
[107:37.18]But Sekiro played like a completely different game than this.
[107:40.28]To me, this feels more like Dark Souls than Sekiro.
[107:42.96]So to me, it's kind of a Dark Souls game in my brain.
[107:54.66]Can I open this?
[107:59.63]Video games are video games.
[108:01.65]Yes, that's precisely what I'm saying.
[108:07.32]Butterflies?
[108:07.80]Can you say something about these?
[108:11.00]Smoldering butterfly.
[108:19.15]I want...
[108:22.02]Oh, shit.
[108:22.70]Okay.
[108:23.12]Well, hold on.
[108:24.85]I think I'm going to come back here because I have 1,200 souls.
[108:30.93]I guess saying jump, jump, jump.
[108:32.03]Fine.
[108:33.83]That actually is very useful.
[108:36.41]Wait, does jump have invincibility frames?
[108:39.95]That's a huge fucking deal if it does.
[108:41.84]It doesn't.
[108:47.58]Okay.
[108:47.92]I just needed to find out.
[108:48.66]I needed to know.
[109:00.56]Wait, I can go up there.
[109:04.00]Get the chest, get the chest.
[109:04.98]Um, hold on.
[109:11.03]Oh, wait, this is a chest?
[109:11.91]I thought this was a wagon.
[109:15.15]This just looks like a wagon.
[109:16.57]This looks like the back, like a bumper.
[109:21.11]Oh.
[109:23.25]Oh my.
[109:24.07]What?
[109:25.37]What?
[109:27.96]18 decks.
[109:28.48]Oh, I'm going to be a flail guy.
[109:31.53]I can't wait.
[109:32.91]Flails?
[109:33.35]There's never been an item like that.
[109:34.39]Holy shit.
[109:36.23]I'm so excited.
[109:37.03]This is awesome.
[109:39.93]Okay, so I got a flail.
[109:44.46]And there's a guy on a horse over there.
[109:48.66]Take off the helmet.
[109:49.42]I will eventually.
[109:51.70]I need to explore.
[109:52.48]Guys, this is not going to be like a 4 hour and 25 minute stream.
[109:56.69]Don't worry.
[109:57.31]I'm here all night.
[109:58.51]I'm not stopping for a long time.
[109:59.83]Is this a chest?
[110:12.79]I don't think you can open these.
[110:19.71]Did I miss anything else?
[110:23.89]I can go down there, but I feel like that's kind of scary.
[110:26.57]So let's just go ahead and do it.
[110:27.50]I'm not reading any more notes because they're spoilers.
[110:40.12]This is too perfect.
[110:46.13]Is it too perfect?
[110:51.70]With a whetstone knife, you can use Ashes of War to grant your armament new skills.
[110:57.95]Hmm?
[111:00.13]An armor can only have one skill.
[111:02.88]Any skill it had will be removed.
[111:05.94]Permanently?
[111:11.56]Adding affinities.
[111:14.50]The Whetstone Knife, you can use Ashes of War to grant affinities to your armaments.
[111:18.20]Okay.
[111:19.48]I know it's like lore definitions, but armaments just means weapons, right?
[111:23.28]That's not some other thing.
[111:26.97]This way you can alter like weapons attack affinity.
[111:30.09]Okay.
[111:31.27]Attribute scaling and more.
[111:32.29]Okay.
[111:35.35]Ashes of War Storm Stomp.
[111:39.08]And a whetstone knife.
[111:40.76]Jesus Christ, man.
[111:41.80]Go offline already.
[111:42.72]Like, what the fuck?
[111:43.82]I don't want to play online anymore.
[111:51.58]I've always hated that.
[111:57.52]Okay.
[111:57.86]I think I've done everything here.
[112:00.04]A new map has been found.
[112:04.10]Lindgrave West.
[112:10.97]It looks like sorcery.
[112:14.79]Oh, there's another wagon here, too.
[112:19.09]What was it?
[112:22.35]Not that one.
[112:22.83]There's another one somewhere.
[112:26.11]Over here.
[112:38.10]Hey.
[112:38.88]Oh.
[112:42.52]Okay, there's two guys here.
[112:50.09]Really?
[112:57.65]Wait!
[113:05.11]You got an R2?
[113:06.62]Yeah.
[113:09.04]Vanquishing an enemy group will replenish your flasks.
[113:13.06]Number and type of flask replenish varies.
[113:18.18]Enemy group?
[113:20.32]Wait, does that... So that means I cleared this camp?
[113:25.60]Oh.
[113:29.30]Can't open that.
[113:32.88]That's kind of cool.
[113:35.28]Alright.
[113:36.24]Just got to open up the back of this wagon over here.
[113:49.10]What do we got here?
[113:53.83]Lord Sworn's Greatsword.
[113:55.35]Definitely can't use that.
[113:58.83]Is this snow in this game?
[113:59.77]If it is, it gets like a full letter grade.
[114:01.35]Damn.
[114:16.86]Probably does have snow.
[114:22.37]I know I want to go in there, but not yet.
[114:24.05]Okay, maybe I will.
[114:31.91]Go fight that boss.
[114:33.48]I need to use a weapon I want to use first.
[114:45.58]I wonder where the level up person is.
[114:55.56]I could sit here and do a new weapon art?
[114:59.51]Oh, hold on.
[115:15.90]I need 18 to put the flail on, so please remind me of that.
[115:19.24]Greetings, traveler from beyond the fog.
[115:25.66]I am Melina.
[115:44.75]Who?
[115:45.51]I offer you an accord.
[115:54.57]have you heard of the finger maidens they serve the Two Fingers night time offering guidance and aid to the tarnished but you I am afraid are maidenless can you stop saying that like stop we have to keep reminding me like I can play the role of maiden like I sound rude
[116:21.44]Turning runes into strength to aid you in your search for the Elden Ring.
[116:30.34]You need only take me with you to the foot of the Erdtree.
[116:36.01]Alright, so we gotta go to the Erdtree.
[116:40.35]Mmm, does this matter?
[116:41.29]I mean I kind of-
[116:43.14]I want to be able to level up in the game, okay?
[116:45.42]I'm not going to do like a hard mode run.
[116:51.20]The ring?
[117:00.79]The spectral steed.
[117:03.63]Okay, now I have the horse.
[117:04.55]I can, okay.
[117:05.83]I was trying to fight the horse boss over and over again with no horse.
[117:11.14]That was probably pretty stupid.
[117:13.70]Alright.
[117:15.96]Use it to traverse great distances.
[117:20.75]A torrent has chosen you.
[117:25.21]Treat him with respect.
[117:29.17]Level up.
[117:30.57]Shall I turn your runes to strength?
[117:33.75]Let my hand rest upon you.
[117:37.17]The samurai is ruining my cutscene.
[117:41.57]Get out of here.
[117:49.50]Okay.
[117:51.80]This is important.
[117:53.14]Alright.
[117:58.34]Vigor is health and fire resistance and immunity.
[118:01.33]So that's important, obviously.
[118:04.51]Mind determines FP.
[118:07.07]FP is mana.
[118:08.99]And also affects focus.
[118:10.03]What is focus?
[118:14.40]Your resistance to sleep and bouts of madness.
[118:17.62]The higher the number, the lower your susceptibility.
[118:19.45]Okay.
[118:24.15]Endurance is stamina like every single other game.
[118:27.13]And equipment load.
[118:28.25]Robustness.
[118:28.97]What's that?
[118:31.05]Blood loss and frostbite.
[118:32.19]Ooh, there's your snow area, by the way.
[118:35.99]Strength.
[118:36.55]Yep.
[118:37.27]Dex.
[118:37.69]Yep.
[118:38.47]We all know what that does.
[118:39.91]But hold on.
[118:40.81]Arcane.
[118:45.59]Attribute governing discovery.
[118:49.99]Holy defense vitality.
[118:52.43]Certain sorceries.
[118:56.70]Arcane is luck.
[118:57.56]Okay.
[119:00.08]Well, I mean, it's 18 to have the flail.
[119:03.52]So I'm going that.
[119:07.35]I'm doing intelligence and dex.
[119:18.14]It's expensive.
[119:22.10]Dex.
[119:23.12]I'm going even into Dex and Intelligence.
[119:26.82]And it's probably going to make me impossible and softlock me from completing the game.
[119:31.12]But I don't think so.
[119:32.36]I think I'll be okay.
[119:41.65]18 for the flail.
[119:42.13]Yeah, I'll go for 15 first.
[119:43.21]18 first.
[119:48.49]Add charge to flask.
[119:50.19]Use... Whoa!
[119:52.09]What?
[119:53.67]Use one gold and... Do I already have one?
[119:55.71]Hold on.
[120:00.40]This is different.
[120:01.26]Alright, I want two and two.
[120:03.96]I already have one?
[120:12.78]Oh, right.
[120:13.28]Okay.
[120:19.43]Oh, Ashes of War.
[120:22.59]Grant skills and affinities.
[120:25.81]Alright.
[120:26.09]Didn't I just get one?
[120:29.68]Storm Stomp.
[120:33.82]Strength scaling.
[120:36.86]Do I consume this stuff?
[120:39.74]If I put this in, is it like gems in Diablo II?
[120:42.09]Am I never going to get this back?
[120:43.83]I don't know.
[120:44.13]I'm kind of scared to do it.
[120:49.22]no okay quality or standard I mean it's gonna be quality right because I mean it's gonna be standard because of the deck scaling oh wait let me see what that does use the spectral steed whistle to summon and ride your spectral steed
[121:14.25]If your steed dies, you can summon it again, but it will cost one flask.
[121:18.73]Oh, shit.
[121:19.59]Really?
[121:20.01]That's... Oh, no.
[121:25.08]Pouches.
[121:30.36]Oh, it's just items.
[121:31.28]Yeah.
[121:33.84]How do I... How do I call the whistle?
[121:36.40]What do I do?
[121:38.18]Left?
[121:39.53]Where's my steed?
[121:50.29]Memory.
[121:51.33]Oh.
[121:52.73]Okay.
[121:54.77]So I have to do this.
[121:58.25]Oh.
[122:03.34]Jump.
[122:05.82]Yeah.
[122:06.10]No shit.
[122:06.80]I fight the horse guy with a horse.
[122:08.98]Okay.
[122:12.08]I need two.
[122:12.62]He wants me to go this way.
[122:18.20]I'm gonna go.
[122:18.72]I'm gonna fuck that guy up.
[122:21.16]But first, I'm gonna get a couple more points.
[122:23.98]Can I stealth with the horse?
[122:25.60]Oh, I can't.
[122:27.58]Is it double jump?
[122:32.49]What?
[122:34.69]How fun is it to be on the horse and stab people?
[122:36.99]That's not the button you do to do that.
[122:38.25]I don't know why I hit X.
[122:52.60]Ow.
[122:57.15]Cool.
[122:58.63]Alright.
[122:58.91]Really cool.
[122:59.51]How much did I need?
[123:00.11]800?
[123:03.93]Can I not cast spells from the horse?
[123:08.97]Whoa.
[123:10.27]One, two, three.
[123:21.46]Oh.
[123:21.62]800.
[123:25.48]I think it was 850.
[123:26.40]Hold and rune.
[123:35.73]I like that you can pick stuff up on the horse.
[123:37.25]That would be awful if you couldn't.
[123:38.29]Okay, there's a sprint.
[123:53.64]Damn.
[123:54.16]Okay, cool.
[123:55.28]Let me get this queued up.
[124:01.85]That should be enough to put one more point in and then I'm gonna go try to kill the horse guy.
[124:06.64]The staff in your right hand.
[124:08.32]Really?
[124:20.93]Oh!
[124:22.49]Can I actually cast from horseback?
[124:24.83]You can!
[124:28.58]Can you drink flasks from horseback?
[124:38.54]You can?
[124:39.08]Okay, awesome.
[124:50.95]get to 16.
[124:59.40]So I'm imagining that she just is at every place.
[125:03.30]Okay, yeah.
[125:09.32]Alright, let's go.
[125:16.41]Alright, the horse guy was back this way.
[125:19.35]I gotta start remembering where the hell this stuff is.
[125:20.85]Horse guy was down here.
[125:23.33]I'm just gonna follow the road.
[125:27.14]See if I can kill him.
[125:28.70]Wait, I gotta go to that one.
[125:31.00]Wait, can I fast travel?
[125:32.68]Yeah.
[125:32.92]Okay.
[125:40.24]What?
[125:45.32]Can't rest right now.
[125:50.20]Who are you talking?
[125:52.70]A pleasure to meet thee, tarnished.
[125:55.30]I am the witch, Rena.
[125:57.25]I'd heard tell of a tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed.
[126:01.33]Wow, this planet.
[126:01.99]And upon looking into the matter, the talk I surmise is of thee.
[126:06.65]How many spells?
[126:07.43]Thou art possessed of the power, no?
[126:10.23]To call forth a spectral steed named Torrent.
[126:16.31]I can call the spectral state.
[126:17.93]Ah, as I had hoped.
[126:20.62]I was entrusted this for thee by Torrent's former master.
[126:25.56]Wow, spirit calling bell?
[126:28.60]Lone wolf ashes.
[126:30.34]This is another one of those kind of weapon art things.
[126:33.57]Summoning spirits with a spirit casting bell.
[126:53.60]can use ashes to summon various spirits summoning typically consumes fp right you can only have one spirit at a time you cannot summon spirits during multiplayer we got more stuff to look at here I have to equip it okay so I have this like horse I have this wolf move
[127:20.07]forgive mine intrusion tarnished I doubt we shall again meet but all the same learn well the Lands Between so did they how long will it be remove before the tarnished tire I'm trying to think of Two Fingers so back in the other FromSoftware games you had consumables like grenades and throwing knives and stones to throw and coins and is this the replacement or is that stuff in the game too
[127:52.11]He's gone.
[127:54.55]Those are still all here.
[127:55.59]I have to really condense what's going to be on this bar down here because I really foresee a problem where I'm just like... Okay, that's what I want.
[128:15.12]I have to actually equip the bell.
[128:17.58]Is it a... Where is it?
[128:27.18]Is it... Where is it?
[128:32.38]The second tab on the menu?
[128:36.72]What?
[128:37.08]Oh.
[128:42.00]What?
[128:44.27]Equip that bell icon.
[128:50.21]It's on my... Oh, it's like... Wait, I can't do it.
[128:57.44]the bell stop saying that equip the gauntlets oh yeah I gotta do uh stuff didn't I it's not gonna be too heavy right let me 7 and 49 still rolling fine okay well I'm just going for it there he is
[129:26.76]Yeah, no, I have it equipped already.
[129:27.94]Alright, dude.
[129:30.87]It's time.
[129:31.23]Let's go.
[129:43.86]Holy shit, what's happening?
[129:48.50]I can queue them up like that?
[129:50.48]What?
[129:54.08]Holy shit, that's overpowered.
[129:55.92]That's absolutely broken.
[130:00.06]What?!
[130:06.45]Okay, hold on.
[130:08.85]That just freaked me out so much.
[130:10.77]You can just spam it?
[130:14.86]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[130:15.64]I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
[130:17.22]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[130:18.44]I'm ready.
[130:22.83]You just got hard countered.
[130:26.07]Yeah, I'm the dickhead that's playing against the fucking Lucario.
[130:31.58]Just sitting there, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam.
[130:34.92]And finally he catches me and he KOs me.
[130:37.40]Alright, it's going to be hard to not spam though because I'm fucking stupid.
[130:45.95]Alright, let's go.
[130:47.55]Patience, I'll kill him right now.
[130:59.86]No!
[131:10.05]This weapon actually probably isn't that great for what I'm... Oh man, that slowdown.
[131:15.93]Um, please fire at him?
[131:17.57]Like, what the fuck?
[131:18.49]I couldn't shoot him.
[131:19.23]That was actually kind of unbearable.
[131:24.58]I couldn't do anything.
[131:28.87]I tried to press right bumper and the game hung.
[131:39.98]Maybe I shouldn't go around that fast.
[131:49.64]We should fight him like this.
[131:52.44]It's his frame rate aura.
[131:54.20]Turn the grass down?
[132:09.22]Alright, grass is on medium.
[132:11.89]I have to go to the main menu for that shit.
[132:13.61]Oh, god damn it.
[132:14.25]Whatever.
[132:20.71]So, is there iframes with the horse dash or anything?
[132:26.03]I'm trying to understand, like, how this kind of works.
[132:30.98]Is there iframes with the horse?
[132:33.62]No, there's not.
[132:34.00]Okay.
[132:34.18]I was just testing.
[132:35.00]Just testing.
[132:38.99]I want to see if that little dash that he does has iframes.
[132:43.44]All the jumps have iframes?
[132:55.42]Lowering the grass can improve it by about 5%.
[132:57.06]I feel like 5% is really not that much.
[132:59.20]It would need to be like 80% for me to notice it, I think.
[133:14.92]What do the wolves do?
[133:15.66]Let me try it.
[133:19.52]What?
[133:26.03]He's just running over trees.
[133:27.23]Do they fight?
[133:34.40]They're actually kind of good.
[133:35.38]Alright, let's go.
[133:53.37]Damn it!
[133:54.53]Ugh!
[134:01.52]What?
[134:04.74]Not good.
[134:12.97]It's empty.
[134:13.57]That took almost my whole FP bar, holy shit, okay.
[134:27.18]Whoops, I thought I had the other weapon!
[134:43.43]Oh shit, he hit the horse.
[134:47.17]Oh my god, this guy.
[134:48.87]Fucking, oh my goodness.
[134:50.39]This is such a new concept.
[135:01.83]This little sword.
[135:02.47]Yeah, I need like a huge lance.
[135:04.48]Okay, so that takes up the whole FP bar.
[135:15.92]Did I unlock the flail yet?
[135:17.14]No, not yet.
[135:18.84]I might be able to two-hand it though.
[135:20.74]I feel like the horse is making it like a hundred times harder.
[135:23.28]Do I just fight him?
[135:25.49]I don't know what to do.
[135:31.34]There's probably like a rhyme or reason to how to actually fight on the horse.
[135:34.02]And I'm just kind of running around just like freaking out.
[135:40.63]I can get off the horse too, right?
[135:42.35]Yeah.
[135:46.79]You might be under leveled.
[135:49.09]I mean, this guy's kind of just like an optional encounter.
[135:51.47]It seems.
[135:58.84]Let's try it.
[135:59.50]Let's see if I can get him hit a few times.
[136:07.65]God he that's okay that goes so far What happened what happened to the horse where's my horse What the fuck did he kill the horse Um, okay
[136:38.83]Let's see if I can do it like this.
[136:39.81]Unfortunately, I have... Can I put this in the other hand?
[136:54.98]Shit.
[136:55.10]God damn it.
[137:08.10]Oh my god.
[137:09.00]I don't think I'm supposed to be fighting this guy right now.
[137:13.41]But he's definitely doable.
[137:24.69]Hmm.
[137:27.31]You better without the horse.
[137:28.41]Yeah, way better.
[137:30.85]I'll come back later.
[137:34.63]He's definitely doable.
[137:35.53]Yeah, he is.
[137:44.92]Wolves and magic?
[137:47.90]I used the whole bar.
[137:48.76]Alright, I'm going... I'm going... I'm going... One more try.
[137:57.29]One more try.
[137:57.91]I need to actually equip the shit on the right bar.
[138:02.57]It's like... It's different on the horse.
[138:06.28]Like that.
[138:06.92]Okay.
[138:08.22]Alright.
[138:09.14]I'm gonna... Let's see if I can do it.
[138:11.40]I'll try it one more time.
[138:12.62]Last try.
[138:12.88]Okay.
[138:16.52]to try parrying him.
[138:17.62]I mean, he can kill you in one hit, so I feel like I just would rather fight him.
[138:22.48]Okay, here we go.
[138:26.11]I thought he was going to swing.
[138:43.82]Long button.
[138:45.92]Oh shit, look at this, they can tank.
[138:54.10]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[138:56.35]Yeah, I'll come back later.
[138:57.91]This is way too hard.
[139:04.81]I can die in one hit.
[139:06.81]He kills you in one swing.
[139:19.01]Remember the quitter?
[139:19.67]Fine.
[139:20.17]Fuck that.
[139:21.25]Last try.
[139:23.74]Last try.
[139:24.44]And I'm... And I'm gonna... Alright, here we go.
[139:29.48]You have to get good.
[139:30.64]I'm... I'm gonna get good right now.
[140:11.19]I'm gonna crush him.
[140:29.79]Hold it.
[140:47.92]There!
[141:25.31]Oh, what the fuck?
[141:26.39]I'm still alive.
[141:49.00]Ah, god damn it, that fucking move.
[142:03.54]alright that shield move is almost a 100 one-hit kill he queues it up he dashes really far and I'm telling you right now forget about magic here absolutely wait I'm doing wolves twice and melee no magic
[142:33.72]Come on.
[142:34.12]Come on.
[142:34.42]Come on.
[142:34.74]I got it.
[142:35.44]I got it.
[142:35.92]Let's do it.
[142:42.46]Yeah, wolves twice.
[142:43.28]It's a big distraction.
[142:45.76]He's going to do this for two hours?
[142:48.08]I'm probably going to do this for a lot longer than that.
[142:52.60]The thing that's the big killer is when he cues up the shield and he goes wham and dashes forward.
[142:58.38]You got to wait for it.
[142:59.38]It's hard to be patient for it.
[143:00.32]Let's go.
[143:16.72]Just co-op him.
[143:17.18]He can't hit us.
[143:19.00]He really can't.
[143:19.56]I don't think he can hit us.
[143:20.56]You know what I mean?
[143:21.32]Oh, fuck off.
[143:29.35]He bumped me.
[143:36.03]Hey!
[144:19.43]Is there another horror?
[144:20.03]Nope.
[144:24.49]Oh, what was that fucking move?
[144:26.33]What the fuck was that?
[144:28.22]He like just slipped his hand down and scraped the ground.
[144:31.44]Come on.
[144:32.06]I don't think I've even seen him do that yet.
[144:37.83]I'll get him.
[144:39.23]I'll definitely get him.
[144:48.04]That's the strat.
[144:49.18]Dogs twice.
[144:54.68]He's got all these little nuanced moves.
[144:56.04]Alright, let's go.
[145:02.23]I can cast one spell at him, then I'll change.
[145:03.91]Here we go.
[145:11.51]Is there a timer on these things?
[145:12.65]I don't think there is.
[145:19.35]Oh, fuck you.
[145:20.39]I got lost in the goddamn bush.
[145:33.78]I gotta turn the music down too.
[145:35.26]I'm like a fucking rave right now.
[145:37.49]I can't concentrate.
[145:50.05]It's so hard sometimes when he just leans over, it's hard to tell if he's gonna swing or not.
[146:10.91]What?
[146:13.19]Can I only do that once?
[146:32.89]Shit.
[146:44.15]Foolish!
[146:46.29]Oh, man.
[146:54.36]Stop using the silly blade.
[146:57.71]I can't equip the other dex item yet.
[147:02.36]No spells.
[147:03.06]Wolves only.
[147:06.00]Yeah, I know.
[147:06.80]It's just so easy to stand back.
[147:08.32]Alright.
[147:10.24]I definitely can do it.
[147:11.57]I got him down to like 30 or 40%.
[147:12.59]I'm certain I can do it.
[147:16.82]You know what?
[147:17.40]I have to get rid of this stupid, silly ass blade.
[147:19.68]Like, it's... I hate this fucking thing.
[147:22.36]This is the worst item in every fucking FromSoftware game.
[147:26.27]It's the worst.
[147:26.85]It's so stupid, it sucks.
[147:28.43]It has one point where you can hurt somebody.
[147:30.83]I'm deleting it.
[147:41.13]I gotta find a new weapon.
[147:42.14]I have to beat this guy on principle only.
[147:45.42]Stop screaming.
[147:46.14]What is this?
[147:46.62]Am I making a YouTube video?
[147:48.00]I mean, I probably will.
[147:48.80]Let's go!
[147:58.59]That stupid bump is the worst move.
[148:01.29]It's so hard.
[148:01.79]I'm fucking... I'm balding.
[148:04.73]That little, tiny little bump that he does with the horse.
[148:07.89]There's almost no telegraphing.
[148:10.13]He just goes like, bump!
[148:10.85]Ah!
[148:29.92]Alright, if I don't do it this time, I'm leaving and I'm gonna go find a new weapon that's not the worst weapon in every FromSoftware game.
[148:36.88]Okay?
[148:37.32]Good.
[148:37.74]Sounds like a plan.
[148:58.67]Oh my god, fuck you.
[149:00.19]What?
[149:01.19]No!
[149:02.33]I'm getting out of here.
[149:03.99]I'm finding something else to do.
[149:06.57]I'm not going to fight the guy that's like the optional fucking boss that requires like 500 more decks than I have.
[149:17.02]I'm leaving.
[149:17.60]Fuck it.
[149:18.52]I don't even care.
[149:24.04]I'm going back home.
[149:25.94]Good luck wolves.
[149:26.90]Fight them.
[149:34.09]Is he still aggroed?
[149:39.85]What?
[149:42.85]He's outside!
[149:43.89]Does he come inside?
[149:48.05]Wait.
[149:48.39]Oh my god, this is scary.
[150:02.30]He just sits out here.
[150:12.54]Oh my god!
[150:13.44]He's gonna knock the whole building down!
[150:15.36]Holy shit, what happens if you knock the building down?
[150:19.09]Can he kill this guy?
[150:19.95]Oh no, I don't want him to kill the NPC.
[150:21.49]That'd be horrible.
[150:24.76]Don't hurt the NPC, please!
[150:26.26]I don't want to restart the whole playthrough.
[150:48.05]Fuck this guy, you know, I'm gonna I'm gone move on I'm gonna find it I'm gonna get the flail and I'm gonna come back I'm gonna get the flail I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna kick his ass after one more attempt
[151:27.32]It worked!
[151:27.66]Didn't work.
[151:32.67]I- I don't think you can parry it.
[151:33.81]That was actually perfect.
[151:35.97]That was a perfectly timed parry, and it didn't do anything.
[151:44.37]Okay.
[151:45.13]Uh, well, I can't beat that guy.
[151:47.30]I'm not supposed to fight that guy.
[151:49.02]That guy's like- I come back like four hours from now and fight that guy.
[151:53.16]Oh, fuck it.
[151:53.60]I'm leaving.
[152:00.80]If it helps, I've been playing for 13 hours and I didn't even know that was a boss.
[152:11.91]Finally, finally.
[152:13.03]But I had to, like, try to prove my, like, gamer skills, right?
[152:16.99]Fight the optional guy.
[152:18.43]That is hard.
[152:19.61]And now everyone's going to tell me about all the other streamers that beat it and I didn't do it.
[152:25.85]And now I have to come back and cheese him with, like, what is the equivalent of Dark Souls 1 lightning.
[152:31.17]Okay?
[152:31.91]Sorry.
[152:33.33]Sorry.
[152:33.71]I'm gonna come back at level 100 and kill him in two hits.
[152:43.54]Okay.
[152:45.64]Let me explore.
[152:46.98]What's over here?
[153:00.42]Your build is not good for killing him immediately.
[153:02.29]Yeah, I know.
[153:04.65]I'm just messing around.
[153:05.25]I'm just kidding.
[153:07.25]It would have been really cool if I used this piece of fucking trash.
[153:10.91]Right, never mind.
[153:12.53]Don't get angry.
[153:14.79]Get even.
[153:19.82]I wonder what these fragments do.
[153:30.98]You're boiling over with rage?
[153:32.39]Oh, no, I am not.
[153:34.57]I'm actually really happy that I can't beat that guy.
[153:38.45]It's just more content.
[153:39.51]You know what I mean?
[153:41.25]Like, I could stream this game for, like, the next three months.
[153:47.65]Urba.
[153:55.08]Oh, what's this?
[153:59.54]Mushrooms?
[154:00.52]There's a little cave over there.
[154:03.96]Mushrooms.
[154:12.39]Ooh.
[154:15.81]What's in here?
[154:16.39]Oh, shit.
[154:16.89]Where am I?
[154:30.46]Do we have face cam now?
[154:31.52]Yeah.
[154:32.70]You've earned it.
[154:36.08]Like, 20 minutes.
[154:37.26]Okay, so... I need to put the flasks back.
[154:47.91]I turned on face cam and, like, my brain just started to blink.
[154:51.83]Alright, what's down here?
[155:06.34]Proper death means returning to the Erdtree.
[155:10.48]Have patience until the time comes and the roots call to you.
[155:13.05]Okay, so I have to go to the tree.
[155:24.00]Eventually.
[155:24.44]It's like a little dungeon.
[155:28.92]This is cool.
[155:35.80]Okay.
[155:36.32]That guy's behind me!
[155:53.37]Hey, what the fuck are you throwing?
[156:08.10]Wait a minute.
[156:12.98]Why do I feel like I... Okay.
[156:15.76]I have a ton of stamina.
[156:18.77]A ton of stamina.
[156:24.17]That's kind of weird.
[156:27.18]How many times can I swing and dodge and stuff?
[156:30.64]I'm just noticing right now that that was only half the stamina bar.
[156:35.83]Root resin.
[156:38.33]You know what I'm saying?
[156:39.07]Like, that was... Do you have more stamina in this game, like, per swing?
[156:42.57]Vinny killed him with your sword.
[157:10.27]Brave Glovewort.
[157:12.35]It's a fucking Harry Potter teacher name.
[157:20.41]Ooh, co-op.
[157:22.19]The summoning pool is now functional.
[157:27.47]Why do I feel like there's a boss in here?
[157:28.77]No, no, no.
[157:32.90]I ain't fucking around.
[157:33.76]I'm casting spells at this guy up there.
[157:56.27]I like that you can actually do that, but it's going to cause me a lot of problems.
[158:04.16]What's over here?
[158:05.78]Grave violet?
[158:11.53]Secret passage.
[158:12.21]They're probably not even in the game.
[158:15.98]Is that water?
[158:28.80]Is that rushing water?
[158:30.35]Oh dear.
[158:35.17]Oh dear.
[158:41.23]Why?
[158:42.37]Is that fair?
[158:58.15]One, two, three, four, it's gonna be close.
[159:06.63]Dude, why are you crouching?
[159:08.39]What the fuck?
[159:20.29]Is something behind there?
[159:28.54]Oh shit, there is.
[159:29.38]Good.
[159:29.62]Alright, what is it?
[159:31.42]Paddling plate?
[159:32.48]Hello.
[159:32.80]Oh.
[159:39.51]oh is that the hello oh my god go where's the very edge one two three go
[160:16.77]Don't go yet.
[160:27.13]One of those guys is going to jump from the ceiling and try to kill me.
[160:30.69]Where is he?
[160:31.19]Where is he?
[160:32.07]I knew you.
[160:32.89]I saw you.
[160:33.47]I knew you were sitting there waiting for you, piece of shit.
[160:35.87]I knew you were going to kill me.
[160:40.15]That guy was pretending to be one of the pots.
[160:49.13]Oh my fucking what the heck is going on here?
[160:51.39]What the heck's happening here, guys?
[160:53.23]What the heck's happening here?
[160:54.71]What the heck's happening here?
[160:56.11]What the heck's happening?
[160:57.27]What the fuck is happening?
[161:12.36]I mean, I gotta go down here.
[161:13.40]I can't just not go down here.
[161:23.26]You dodged into it.
[161:24.16]Yeah, it's called panicking because it's scary.
[161:28.58]What even is this?
[161:30.81]Walked by some contraption.
[161:33.25]You probably open it and leave.
[161:36.59]Alright.
[161:38.47]I'm not gonna waste magic.
[161:41.72]Actually, this is the perfect time to use the magic.
[161:48.59]Although, I feel like it's a waste.
[161:52.33]It is.
[161:52.55]I can fight these guys without it.
[161:53.49]Unless they don't fall down.
[161:55.47]Does he jump?
[161:58.54]I don't think he does.
[162:07.24]Okay.
[162:07.82]Back to that fire road.
[162:08.74]There's got to be something at the end of this.
[162:10.66]Something good, right?
[162:14.46]Oh my freaking god, what the heck?
[162:16.46]Oh, what the heck's going on here?
[162:17.58]Alright, this guy up there, there he is.
[162:24.35]They're doing the stupid thing that is in every horror movie.
[162:27.41]They're in the corner of the bedroom and they, they, they, their head cracks and they look at you.
[162:45.21]Alright, here we go.
[162:59.64]Holy shit, I timed it right.
[163:00.98]Okay, here they all come.
[163:07.78]I have to do this right.
[163:08.82]Oh my god, how did I not see all these guys on the wall?
[163:12.74]How did I not see those guys?
[163:15.39]They actually fooled me.
[163:16.57]I was completely fooled.
[163:22.14]Ready?
[163:30.32]I'm scared!
[163:37.58]Okay.
[163:39.02]Can they climb?
[163:40.04]Oh, shit.
[163:40.34]He can climb.
[163:40.74]How do I knock him down?
[163:43.30]How do I do the thing that they do in PvP?
[163:44.70]Fuck no!
[163:51.75]I like forgot that you could like kick down.
[163:53.73]I didn't know if you could climb or not.
[163:55.33]God damn it.
[163:56.09]I'm like purple.
[163:57.55]What happened?
[164:01.69]Why am I purple?
[164:03.29]Why am I purple?
[164:27.99]They're gonna die by the fire, doesn't matter.
[164:38.16]Oh my god, it's right in my face!
[164:42.44]Alright, let's get out of here.
[164:43.74]Give me my lost souls.
[164:44.96]Get up.
[164:48.62]I would turn to the camera and all my facial hair and my eyebrows would be gone.
[164:52.79]I ain't moving until I'm certain of what's going on here.
[165:14.10]I'm not moving an inch.
[165:17.66]Yep.
[165:18.36]Hey, bud.
[165:34.56]First off, down, then lever.
[165:37.76]First off, down, then lever.
[165:41.14]Oh.
[165:43.20]That's kind of cool.
[165:43.72]Not yet.
[165:52.83]Are you kidding me?
[166:00.56]Stop throwing those!
[166:02.32]Is he still alive?
[166:18.67]You're not going to fool me now.
[166:22.07]Somebody right above me.
[166:28.37]Is somebody actually in this room?
[166:29.79]They're all gonna climb out of these little divots.
[166:36.48]Wandering noble ashes.
[166:38.24]Ooh.
[166:39.34]That's a new move.
[166:43.06]Destruction.
[166:48.10]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[166:49.42]I got what I wanted.
[166:50.32]It's a new summon.
[166:51.64]This game's really good.
[166:54.73]This is just a random dungeon.
[166:56.25]Just a random little spot.
[166:58.45]This is really cool.
[166:59.29]This is awesome.
[167:01.57]Okay, so I can pull this lever, though.
[167:02.89]What does that do?
[167:07.19]Something down here?
[167:07.75]Ooh, that's probably for the door.
[167:20.94]Got a lever.
[167:25.86]Somewhere a heavy door is open.
[167:27.18]Nice.
[167:27.44]Is somebody behind me?
[167:33.14]That would have been scary if I had even paid any attention to you.
[167:36.52]I was paying zero attention.
[167:37.56]Zero.
[167:42.94]Okay, so that door opened.
[167:43.98]I'm going to go sit at the bonfire.
[168:03.46]That's that new move I have.
[168:04.24]What does it do?
[168:06.80]It's like a stun.
[168:07.48]Okay, that's cool.
[168:07.82]Hold on, I'm going to do a little bit of gamer exercising.
[168:14.44]I'm turning off online, seriously.
[168:15.82]I keep thinking it's somebody.
[168:16.60]Alright, I'm sitting at the fire.
[168:28.06]I think I have enough to level up.
[168:30.81]Can you level up at any bonfire?
[168:34.57]Holy my... Is it off?
[168:36.53]Because I almost just walked into fire, probably.
[168:38.77]Alright, where's the... There it is.
[168:45.42]I'm close to the flail.
[168:47.98]Oh, that's really awesome.
[168:48.74]You can do it anywhere.
[168:49.40]Alright, 17.
[168:51.14]We need one more point in dex, and I can use the flail.
[168:58.08]Level your chin up to level 2.
[168:59.10]Good.
[169:01.45]Good.
[169:05.46]Is this game like L.A.
[169:06.28]Noire?
[169:06.56]Yeah, it's exactly the same.
[169:09.72]Each one of these enemy encounters, it goes like a zoom in to the enemy's face.
[169:14.48]And you have to decide whether or not you're going to trust them or not.
[169:17.97]Well, they go like this.
[169:33.14]This is a boss.
[169:43.20]Entry Burial Watchdog.
[169:50.83]What the hell?
[169:51.99]Okay.
[169:54.75]Holy shi- That- That extreme action figure.
[169:59.91]Press the button on his back.
[170:09.77]What the fuck, dude?
[170:10.85]His moves happen in one second!
[170:15.52]He's like a G.I.
[170:16.48]Joe.
[170:31.10]Does this hurt him?
[170:34.76]Oh, that hurts him a lot.
[170:35.66]Let's go.
[170:38.53]Spam.
[170:52.65]Oh get cheese ball Oh
[171:14.75]Alright, this guy wasn't that bad.
[171:34.30]Alright, that guy wasn't that bad.
[171:38.75]Enemy fell.
[171:39.55]Noble Sorcerer Ashes.
[171:43.93]That guy wasn't that bad.
[171:49.14]Ah, weak foe.
[171:50.54]I did it.
[171:50.88]You know what?
[171:53.38]That person could be... You know what?
[171:54.72]You did do it.
[171:56.94]And I rated it poorly again.
[171:59.38]That guy... Who knows?
[172:00.12]That person could have, like, just bought the game from, like, Walmart today.
[172:03.10]And... I just, like... I keep... It's not... It's start.
[172:08.24]And then... Whatever.
[172:09.16]It's select.
[172:09.82]It's not start.
[172:11.56]Turn to entrance.
[172:15.76]I'm going to look like such an asshole.
[172:20.56]You know, now I understand why some videos just have like 10 dislikes randomly.
[172:27.14]It's probably because they just pressed the wrong button.
[172:30.30]I get it.
[172:30.64]I think that's it, right?
[172:37.31]That was cool.
[172:38.49]That was a fun one.
[172:48.62]I dislike all of your videos.
[172:51.72]Well.
[172:55.14]Join the party.
[172:59.40]Apologize for what?
[173:03.48]Oh, it's flail time, guys.
[173:09.98]Finally.
[173:10.48]Alright.
[173:13.77]This helps my casting, too, because it's casting speed, so that's good.
[173:17.49]We got it.
[173:22.53]109 plus 21.
[173:23.21]Yeah, that's better.
[173:26.97]FP cost?
[173:27.85]Okay, that's spinning chain.
[173:29.10]Let's take a look.
[173:35.18]Oh, that's cool.
[173:40.56]Nice.
[173:40.90]What's the chart?
[173:43.92]That's awesome.
[173:49.49]It's kind of slow, but I think it'll be alright.
[173:51.95]How about two-handed?
[174:00.26]I love it.
[174:01.02]What about the weapon art?
[174:01.70]Let's see.
[174:05.70]Holy shit, that's awesome.
[174:08.22]What does that do?
[174:09.62]Is that a block?
[174:12.57]It takes up FP.
[174:21.58]I wonder if I can... Can I attack out of this?
[174:26.27]I can.
[174:31.93]Alright.
[174:34.24]I think I'm going to use this weapon.
[174:37.56]What's FP?
[174:38.26]FP is mana.
[174:39.00]It's the blue bar.
[174:43.68]Very cool.
[174:45.95]That was awesome.
[174:54.04]I want to check it out.
[174:55.74]What is it?
[174:59.36]I got to buy that crafting thing.
[175:03.34]Can I still kill people with a stealth?
[175:12.41]It's a little loud for me.
[175:14.83]Music at least.
[175:15.51]I'm going to turn the music down just a little bit.
[175:19.81]Just a little bit.
[175:26.08]Okay.
[175:27.86]That's it.
[175:28.86]Only one notch.
[175:34.79]So that was here.
[175:37.11]Okay, that's cool.
[175:37.67]I wonder what that is.
[175:41.99]Might as well spit in the... Never mind.
[175:58.19]I love this weapon.
[176:01.40]It is so much better.
[176:04.32]This is running away.
[176:17.65]The scaling on this is not great though.
[176:19.87]Probably gets better.
[176:22.01]You zoom the map all the way out.
[176:27.70]Uh, I think this is what we have here.
[176:30.53]Unless there's more.
[176:32.71]Is there more?
[176:33.17]Or is this the whole game?
[176:34.85]I don't know.
[176:37.21]There's way more zones.
[176:47.34]Oh my god.
[176:48.06]Uh, I see that statue and I raise you going to go see it.
[177:05.37]This is literally the tutorial.
[177:07.65]This is the tutorial.
[177:08.99]This is so cool.
[177:10.49]This is so good.
[177:14.63]Wait, let's check this out.
[177:25.04]I might be able to kill that guy now.
[177:32.30]I want to go check out that statue up there.
[177:36.56]Oh wait, this is like another catacombs?
[177:42.22]Kinda looks like a catacombs.
[177:52.01]Where's that statue?
[178:05.54]What's this?
[178:13.55]Whoa.
[178:19.01]Ultimate nerd neck.
[178:25.17]Dude, I'm just saying, put your monitor up a little higher.
[178:30.33]So many people, the reason why they're like this is because their monitors, put your monitor a little higher so your eyeline is here, not here, looking down like this at your monitor.
[178:40.77]Here.
[178:41.03]You want your eyeline to be right here.
[178:46.83]Okay, I don't think... Can I do anything with this?
[178:49.47]Holding something.
[178:55.23]That's where... That's the... Okay, that's where I was before.
[178:57.35]Let me do the crafting thing.
[179:03.63]It looks like the ice cream lady from Spongebob.
[179:10.68]I don't know who you mean, but...
[179:17.30]Yes.
[179:26.05]This thing.
[179:26.55]Enables the practice of item crafting.
[179:30.81]Ooh, I could buy these, too.
[179:33.73]A lot of money.
[179:34.25]Wait.
[179:36.81]Note, waypoint runes.
[179:38.57]Note, flask of wondrous physique.
[179:42.81]What is this?
[179:47.13]I'm just gonna buy it.
[179:56.32]Is it raided?
[179:57.00]Who's raiding?
[179:57.72]He's on there.
[180:01.28]Did I just get raided by G4 TV?
[180:03.64]Like G4.
[180:04.92]The G4.
[180:09.51]What's up?
[180:12.43]Playing some Elden Ring.
[180:13.25]What's happening?
[180:16.60]Holy shit.
[180:17.02]Well, hey, welcome everybody from G4.
[180:20.39]My name is Jerma, and we're playing some Elden Ring.
[180:25.17]Uh, I got to warn everybody here though. I'm pretty new to the Souls uh games.
[180:30.17]I haven't really played very- very many of them.
[180:33.17]So I've- it's about hour number like three or four.
[180:36.17]Um I- I've died to the first boss.
[180:38.17]Uh I'm just still trying to find out how to like swing the weapon and stuff and combo moves together.
[180:44.17]Um people are telling me I need to equip something called like the Estus Flask. I don't know where that is.
[180:48.17]Maybe some of you guys can help me when you come on in here but thanks. Welcome everybody.
[180:52.17]Um, I'm still kind of learning.
[180:57.28]Yeah, so people are saying that this thing here does some kind of heal.
[181:02.85]Is it a heal over time?
[181:03.81]Because I have two of them.
[181:04.53]I don't know what the other one does.
[181:05.35]I don't know.
[181:08.51]I'm probably going to stop playing this game after like a few hours.
[181:10.93]I'm not like, I don't really get it.
[181:12.87]I don't even know why people play these, but.
[181:14.37]Welcome, hi everybody.
[181:17.16]Alright, I'm going to buy, what do I buy?
[181:21.02]I was seriously next to the right G4.
[181:23.28]I used to watch G4 when I was a kid.
[181:26.48]It was like permanently on TV.
[181:30.57]I want to come back and buy this stuff because it's just easy.
[181:34.67]Like in Bloodborne, you buy the hunter's outfit.
[181:39.83]Alright, where are we going?
[181:45.18]Should I kill the... Okay, here we go.
[181:47.76]Hey, new viewers.
[181:51.20]Not a big deal.
[182:22.77]I don't know how to fucking heal, so of course I'm not gonna know what I'm doing.
[182:38.68]I actually probably could kill him now.
[182:40.92]Whoa, what happened?
[182:41.76]Why am I back here?
[182:44.86]Use those summons.
[182:45.70]Oh, I did get some new stuff, man.
[182:48.04]Let me check.
[182:52.74]stomp all I have only I only I only have is I only have stomp where are the other ones didn't I get them it's in items ah where

[183:27.22]Wait, why can't I... Number held.
[183:32.82]Why can't I equip it?
[183:39.22]Why are you a normie Dark Souls streamer?
[183:45.77]Guys, I'm gonna watch Infinity War when it comes out, okay?
[183:48.27]I'm not gonna not watch Infinity War.
[183:51.51]Like, what?
[183:52.57]Because, no, I don't want to watch that normie movie.
[183:56.29]Every single person's seen Infinity War.
[183:58.11]If you're over the age of 12, you've seen Infinity War at this point.
[184:01.75]I don't think there's a person on Earth that hasn't seen it.
[184:04.97]I'm gonna play Infinity War, okay?
[184:07.59]How do I equip this?
[184:08.39]I actually don't know.
[184:09.09]I'm sorry, G4TV.
[184:14.49]Why can I not... How do I take this off?
[184:20.17]Discard?
[184:20.79]I feel like I could throw it away.
[184:22.73]It's on your actual item bar.
[184:24.71]Oh, right.
[184:25.27]Okay, that makes sense.
[184:30.14]Let's do the sorcerer.
[184:30.94]Let's see what this guy's like.
[184:38.30]Noble sorcerer ashes.
[184:39.46]Can I use it?
[184:48.37]Is it not equipped?
[184:50.73]I don't get it.
[185:02.28]You can only use it... Oh, I can't.
[185:03.50]Okay.
[185:03.60]Alright, let me travel over there.

[185:11.65]Oh, I don't have to... I'm so used to traveling like that.
[185:20.05]In the other games.
[185:20.61]You can just do it from the map.
[185:29.44]Okay.
[185:30.68]It's time.
[185:31.28]We're going to use the old noble sorceress and see what happens.
[185:35.94]And I'm going to try to kill the horse guy again.

[198:02.67]I have like 5% vitality that I need to have to fight this guy.
[198:07.73]Do you get it?
[198:08.37]I'll get him right now.
[198:24.74]The wolves were way better.
[198:28.66]Anyway... And yes, I'm sorry!
[198:39.58]I had my shirt on the coat hanger for too long, and it's ruined now!
[198:43.10]Okay?
[198:43.46]Let me just get it out there first!
[198:56.00]Oh my fucking god!
[199:14.48]You stupid game!
[199:21.37]I have no health left!
[199:51.61]What?!
[199:53.51]I dodged at the exact perfect time!
[200:20.23]Oh no!
[200:20.77]What am I supposed to do?
[200:21.99]You can't dodge it.
[200:22.65]He doesn't scream.
[200:23.51]There's like this like fucking Sonic blast.
[200:29.37]I didn't think I would be this like fucking malding at this point.
[200:38.02]New strat.
[200:40.10]New strat, new strat, new strat.
[200:41.18]I'm gonna calm down.
[200:41.80]Just relax.
[200:46.14]I need the extra health.
[200:47.78]We're gonna summon dogs once.
[200:50.65]And then I'm just going to get good.
[200:55.41]This guy's fucking hard.
[200:56.39]Come on.
[200:56.63]This guy's hard.
[200:58.31]It's teaching you this whole new bullshit of mechanics.
[201:02.62]Like, ride your horse to fight him.
[201:04.26]I'm not going to do that.
[201:05.58]I'm not doing that.
[201:06.32]Let's go.
[201:14.10]It has not been seven hours, has it?
[201:15.26]Holy shit, this game is amazing.
[201:17.30]Let's go.
[201:17.48]Alright, I'm ready.
[201:53.92]Fuck that move.
[201:54.86]That move sucks.
[202:43.95]Have you tried turning your monitor on?
[202:46.23]Uh, you know what?
[202:49.50]You know, I don't know.
[202:50.50]I don't think it's been on this whole time.
[202:51.90]Alright, I can- I can definitely do it.
[202:53.94]Maybe one more point in Dex.
[202:58.80]I keep bumping into these rocks.
[203:01.30]And this- these fucking things get in the way.
[203:03.00]They really do.
[203:10.52]Okay, come on.
[203:11.22]This is it.
[203:13.74]He has to dodge.
[203:49.05]It's that stupid bump!
[203:51.41]When he's just like, here I go, I'm gonna... It's like, fuck you!
[203:55.13]There's no telegraph!
[203:57.73]It's just like, here we go!
[203:59.39]Like, what the fuck is that shit?! !
[204:22.56]Okay, I'll come back later again.
[204:24.12]Fuck this guy.
[204:24.88]I first tried that other stupid action figure boss.
[204:29.05]I'm killing him right now.
[204:30.05]I'm very angry, but I'm gonna slow down.
[204:32.31]And I'm gonna get two, three, four free hits.
[204:48.11]I'm so far away.
[205:08.63]Oh shit, we're in lag city right now.
[205:10.33]I gotta back it up.
[205:12.68]We're in lag city.
[205:16.80]Back over here.
[205:17.34]Come on.
[205:20.18]Come on!
[205:20.88]Stop!
[205:21.14]I need you to come back here.
[205:21.97]This is lag city down here.
[205:23.43]I can't play here.
[205:24.85]Oh god.
[205:37.83]It's gonna ruin everything.
[205:59.62]THAT MOVE!
[206:00.74]IT'S GOT ME!
[206:02.12]EVERY!
[206:19.55]It's impossible.
[206:20.67]It's impossible.
[206:21.41]It's impossible.
[206:22.55]It's not possible.
[206:23.95]It's possible if you're very good at stuff.
[206:26.95]But it's impossible if you are not leveled correctly and the guy's an optional encounter.
[206:31.29]You don't have to even fight this guy.
[206:32.85]I've been wasting five hours just trying to come back to fight this optional golden knight guy.
[206:37.85]And I don't have to do this.
[206:40.11]But I'm going to do it again.
[206:40.89]How long has it been?
[206:46.89]Like two hours?
[206:52.42]I've consistently been getting him lower though.
[206:56.21]I got him down to like 30%.
[206:56.81]Which before I couldn't.
[206:58.63]Alright, no more fucking around.
[206:59.62]Let's relax.
[208:01.16]Every time!
[208:09.47]I think I can... Oh, fuck you for chaining that shit together!
[208:29.18]Flag city!
[208:46.70]Oh my god!
[208:48.06]His moves and patterns are just so all over the place.
[208:51.88]I've had it.
[208:52.20]You know what would be great?
[208:55.68]If I put one goddamn other point in fucking vitality.
[209:00.12]And instead, I have the same amount of vitality that you start with as the naked guy.
[209:05.24]Alright, I'm fucking out of here.
[209:18.35]I'm out.
[209:19.69]I'm going this way.
[209:37.25]Don't call me a quarter.
[209:38.11]I'll go back.
[209:40.97]Item on the horse?
[209:41.63]The horse is like sloppy for me.
[209:43.21]I gotta get used to it first.
[209:48.29]Alright, we need to go over here.
[209:49.09]I'm gonna put a marker here.
[209:58.86]I never took you for a quitter.
[209:59.90]That guy's hard!
[210:00.86]Alright, let's go... I don't have to do this.
[210:05.62]I can just teleport.
[210:12.96]Who is that guy?
[210:13.74]That guy was cool.
[210:14.18]Alright, here's the thing, though.
[210:15.76]Let me explain why this game is awesome.
[210:18.52]Uh, so... I... I can't move on from that guy.
[210:23.44]Like, I know I'm, like, not supposed to be killing that guy right now.
[210:26.36]Oh, you could.
[210:28.44]You know, if you're just really good and you just dodge everything and you get everything right.
[210:31.10]Yeah, of course.
[210:31.73]Sure.
[210:32.67]But... It's... This is crazy that I can just sit there for, like, a couple hours and just lose him.
[210:44.64]I like the optional stuff.
[210:45.54]Alright, come on.
[210:46.62]Um.
[210:46.76]And he shoots that at you.
[210:53.93]That's good.
[210:55.73]Um.
[210:57.35]Let's go ahead and get on the horse, please.
[211:04.00]He's shooting right in the eye.
[211:14.11]That's not the button I wanted to attack him.
[211:16.07]It's been a while since I've played a FromSoftware Souls.
[211:27.74]I'm X, I'm hitting X to swing on the horse, not right bumper.
[211:31.64]Alright, I'm still like, I'm still like tapped out from that fucking goddamn horse asshole.
[211:48.61]Okay.
[211:58.56]Get a fucking way from me!
[212:00.08]Alright, that's not how you're supposed to do this.
[212:11.56]I gotta like get over there, get off the horse and kill them.
[212:14.37]I'll get it.
[212:16.82]Oh, this is this is tricky.
[212:35.04]He's already here.
[212:55.13]HORSES!
[212:55.75]ASSEMBLE!
[213:00.46]I pressed X to attack on the fucking horse again.
[213:03.52]I don't know why.
[213:04.16]I'm so used to playing like Dynasty Warriors or something.
[213:07.66]Why do I think I'm playing like Dynasty Warriors?
[213:10.90]What game do you use X to attack on horseback?
[213:22.67]Holy shit, there's so many people.
[213:26.11]I thought... Oh shit!
[213:37.09]Thanks.
[213:37.67]Jesus!
[213:59.08]I need my magical stave!
[214:13.04]Don't go towards the huge guy!
[214:14.84]Go away from the huge guy!
[214:25.23]The entire fucking village is here!
[214:47.80]Is there- should I just go run away or something?
[214:49.86]Because like, what the fuck am I even here for?
[215:08.81]Oh shit, he can kill them.
[215:09.59]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[215:11.29]I didn't want to swing yet!
[215:20.51]You're a quitter.
[215:21.65]I'm still here!
[215:22.47]Dude, he's going so fast!
[215:50.36]Alright, let's go.
[215:53.56]Oh my chest!
[215:56.68]I'm fine.
[215:57.02]Alright, take his legs out.
[216:18.57]Watch out for the Sonic blast.
[216:39.83]Don't get cocky, don't be an idiot.
[216:49.65]I gotta queue up like the wing wing wing.
[216:56.94]Get outta here, motherfucker!
[217:24.07]I'll get him!
[217:30.81]Oh shit, this is bad.
[217:33.54]New moveset.
[217:34.16]I forget what it does.
[218:00.35]Rebind that, please, Jeremy.
[218:03.15]What are you doing?
[218:04.09]Aye, aye, aye.
[218:23.50]I'm dead.
[218:24.02]I'm dead.
[218:24.40]I'm dead.
[218:24.72]I'm dead.
[218:25.12]I'm dead.
[218:25.50]I'm dead.
[218:25.78]I'm gonna die right now.
[218:26.38]I'm dead.
[218:27.10]I think I'm dead here.
[218:32.16]I'm watching like a scary movie.
[218:34.14]I have to run away.
[218:39.70]I can't kill him right now.
[218:41.05]I don't... If he hits me one more time, I'm dead.
[218:50.37]Just run.
[218:51.73]Quit, coward.
[218:52.77]Dude, don't call me that.
[218:59.06]Just stay way the fuck away from him.
[219:02.66]Two... Then he gets really... He gets really up on you!
[219:06.26]He gets really up on you!
[219:11.18]OIIIIIIII!
[219:17.23]Oh!
[219:17.47]That's okay.
[219:25.97]I need enough... I gotta take him outside.
[219:29.89]Alright, no more like YouTuber screams, okay?
[219:40.82]Fuck.
[219:41.82]I gotta take him outside, don't I?
[219:48.09]No, I don't want to go outside.
[219:48.99]There's people out there.
[220:05.91]End that game!
[220:39.67]Alright, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[220:42.74]Don't aggro all these knights.
[221:15.77]I didn't think he was close enough.
[221:17.27]I thought he was too far away to do that.
[221:22.64]Use your magic.
[221:23.82]Because I used the wolves and it went to zero and I... Yeah, it's magic Andy time.
[221:28.34]Alright.
[221:28.98]Where was this last... Where am I going?
[221:30.96]Which is the last gravesite, right?
[221:33.28]That was a goofy reaction.
[221:34.57]Yeah, like, whoa, I dropped the controller.
[221:38.43]Okay, it's magic on this guy and...
[221:44.18]I thought I could get him with the melee shit.
[221:46.18]Ay, ay, ay.
[221:47.62]This is fucking crazy.
[221:56.27]Oh man, I gotta fight all that shit again.
[222:01.59]But I don't have to.
[222:02.21]I can just go through it.
[222:03.09]But man, do I want to try.
[222:04.49]That's like...
[222:26.29]How's your day?
[222:26.84]It's going... It's going good.
[222:31.20]Just kite him outside.
[222:33.10]It's actually probably a better idea to do that.
[222:35.12]Probably making this way more difficult than I have to.
[222:37.24]How was your day?
[222:50.00]Is your day good?
[222:51.08]I hope so.
[222:56.60]so these people here I don't it's gonna take a while I think I could fight him out here and plus he'll kill those guys yeah he'll kill those guys gamer exercises hold on we're good yeah I wonder if I can let me just get him to come let me just get him to jump down
[223:23.49]And then I'm just going to run out.
[223:24.89]And I'm just going to run around him.
[223:26.13]And I'm going to cast my magical spells.
[223:27.53]And I'm just going to run around him.
[223:51.96]That's definitely the strategy for sure.
[223:53.46]Don't even go near him.
[223:54.75]Unless I have to.
[224:08.61]Two at a time.
[224:09.13]Two at a time is fine.
[224:19.84]This is not going to bring him to zero.
[224:26.94]I'm okay.
[224:27.88]I gotta remember he does that.
[224:29.08]This actually might bring him to zero.
[224:35.75]Fuck you!
[224:36.35]Yeah, I'll get him here.
[224:42.07]That made that so much more difficult on myself than I had to.
[224:47.31]Holy goodness.
[224:49.24]You're...
[224:57.38]Alright.
[224:58.06]Die.
[224:58.22]Got him.
[224:59.36]That was so much easier than I made it.
[225:02.48]Oh, jeez.
[225:03.16]Okay.
[225:04.76]That was way easier.
[225:10.33]Okay.
[225:10.83]Now I can go take those guys out and be able to be clean.
[225:16.11]I have some pre-recorded gameplay of me beating this boss if you'd rather just use it.
[225:19.11]This is not a boss.
[225:22.99]This is a regular guy.
[225:30.74]Is this not hitting?
[225:32.36]It's hitting for fucking free.
[225:33.88]Oh my god, dude.
[225:42.39]Get off the horse.
[225:42.93]Get off the horse.
[225:43.83]It's just... Why am I holding this stupid fencing weapon again?
[226:11.31]Can't see your souls.
[226:12.39]Oh, shit.
[226:12.81]I'll move it.
[226:19.62]He's still alive.
[226:20.40]Holy shit.
[226:29.30]I thought I could get a backstab.
[226:30.17]It was a mistake.
[226:34.35]Don't be cute about it.
[226:35.97]Just kill him.
[226:50.63]Okay, we're good.
[226:52.27]Everything is fine.
[226:52.99]I can now explore a little bit.
[226:54.63]Make sure I get all the items that I need.
[226:56.03]Put on the actual weapon that I should have on.
[226:58.39]And that's kind of cool.
[226:59.63]Okay.
[227:11.79]Okay.
[227:12.63]So now... I still have a heal.
[227:15.35]Which is good.
[227:20.16]You should have been cute about it.
[227:21.38]No.
[227:26.42]I got the crafting thing.
[227:27.70]I don't know what I should do with it though.
[227:34.69]I wonder if the big guy respawns.
[227:39.37]You look like a PS2 Sopranos character.
[227:45.05]Golden Rune?
[227:45.63]I don't know.
[227:58.32]What does that even mean?
[227:59.04]I actually kind of don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[228:02.24]What does that mean?
[228:05.71]PS2?
[228:06.09]Let's move the camera.
[228:10.81]Yep.
[228:14.62]Where should I put it?
[228:15.78]Up here?
[228:17.24]Here?
[228:17.44]Somewhere in the middle?
[228:18.40]Top right?
[228:18.78]Top right?
[228:23.07]Or kind of middle right?
[228:23.83]Yeah, that looks good.
[228:29.59]What do I have for notes?
[228:34.29]Wow, great notes.
[228:38.45]Actually, kind of good notes, because I wouldn't have remembered that.
[228:49.04]Alright, onward.
[228:56.06]Herba.
[229:00.46]Mushrooms.
[229:01.26]Alright, there's a motherfucker right here.
[229:14.49]Actually, the bow might not be a bad idea because...
[229:18.70]I'm doing a lot of decks.
[229:19.38]Okay, left bumper for precision, right to adjust.
[229:25.51]RB, arrow 1, arrow 2.
[229:29.27]I mean, the game wants me to... Don't do that!
[229:46.07]They just blocked all that damage, good.
[229:51.37]Will you get the fuck out of here?
[229:57.09]I didn't even get a chance to put the bow on.
[230:18.79]Oh, nice.
[230:19.37]Okay, I cleared a camp, right?
[230:20.75]A little bit of shmeet.
[230:23.66]A little bit of shmeet.
[230:26.60]Why are you saying that?
[230:33.86]Wolves actually have been the best.
[230:35.46]The sorceress guy was probably... Might be good later.
[230:39.71]I would imagine might be pretty good later on.
[230:43.03]Let me put the bow on.
[230:51.82]Oh, I don't have enough strength.
[230:52.86]Did they change the way that rolling works?
[231:01.41]My equipment load is 33 out of 49.
[231:03.21]I'm still rolling faster.
[231:06.41]Did they change that?
[231:07.77]I kind of feel like they did.
[231:24.65]Alright, where are we?
[231:27.88]I gotta head this way.
[231:28.72]Should we break the skulls on the ground?
[231:36.16]Break the skulls?
[231:44.97]You mean like those big skull head things?
[231:50.42]Where are they?
[231:55.88]I'll find him later.
[232:00.30]Continue.
[232:00.84]I need another bonfire.
[232:05.76]My voice is so junk at the moment, I'm just screaming.
[232:10.58]No more screaming.
[232:11.84]I just like, I'm like, I lean back and I make like weird sounds.
[232:14.87]That's really cool looking.
[232:22.49]Stormhill.
[232:24.81]Oh!
[232:24.99]This is Estes' thing.
[232:27.05]I'm going to go this way.
[232:42.75]Let's try... Over here?
[232:46.83]I'm going to check this spot over here.
[232:53.48]I think there might be something over here.
[233:00.37]Don't forget to drink water.
[233:01.13]Yeah, I'll get a refill.
[233:08.35]Old tinged excrement.
[233:09.65]Okay, so I'm currently in this little forest area.
[233:24.25]Can I go over here?
[233:24.83]Kind of.
[233:34.12]What was that?
[233:39.20]Would this be a lovable sort?
[233:42.29]What?
[233:48.47]I, like, pet the owl?
[233:56.14]I don't know.
[234:03.96]Okay.
[234:04.80]I can't get over... Maybe I can get over there from here.
[234:15.13]Gotta be something over here, right?
[234:15.99]There's like jellyfish things up there.
[234:27.18]Are you serious?
[234:30.20]What were you thinking?
[234:33.36]I can go around.
[234:47.01]I'm looking for one of those dungeons.
[235:01.44]Alright.
[235:06.52]Alright, I'm in the jellyfish.
[235:12.38]I need a place to octopus ahead.
[235:14.52]Yeah, okay, I see it.
[235:15.50]Are these hostile?
[235:23.13]That's not an octopus, by the way.
[235:24.33]That's a squid.
[235:25.43]They're not hostile.
[235:32.07]I see an item.
[235:41.47]Mushroom.
[235:41.91]Mushroom.
[235:42.51]Anything else here?
[235:45.14]New weapon.
[235:46.60]Smith Exploding Stone.
[235:54.40]Oh, shit.
[235:54.86]What's this?
[236:12.96]I was hitting A to dodge, but A is jump.
[236:16.42]They've added more buttons to this game.
[236:18.42]It's not just dodge and attack.
[236:20.76]There's, like, dodge.
[236:21.98]There's jump.
[236:23.16]There's wolf move.
[236:24.94]There's ride the horse.
[236:29.15]Ah, shit.
[236:29.97]I need to get those.
[236:30.77]That's bad.
[236:31.31]That was, like, two or three thousand.
[236:38.21]This guy's back?
[236:41.70]Oh my god, he is.
[236:49.70]I am not... I'm not fucking around now.
[236:53.54]I don't care.
[236:55.88]Go ahead.
[236:56.34]Blow the horn.
[237:02.30]Just don't walk off a cliff.
[237:10.61]Nope.
[237:10.97]Can't do that.
[237:12.27]Maybe I can.
[237:12.79]Nope.
[237:13.89]Go the right way.
[237:21.49]Got zero swag.
[237:27.63]I don't care.
[237:30.17]Why do I need swag?
[237:31.39]I don't need any swag.
[237:35.36]Okay.
[237:38.92]Watch out for those weird hollow skeleton people.
[237:55.87]How come I only- Oh fuck, that's right.
[238:00.11]Forgot, okay.
[238:00.83]I only have one Estus allocated.
[238:06.52]What else is over here?
[238:14.12]Yeah, funny.
[238:20.27]Oh no, another pig!
[238:24.40]Okay, skeleton, skeleton.
[238:25.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[238:29.61]I failed.
[238:30.75]Don't you... Um, what?
[238:37.09]What's wrong with this guy?
[238:47.14]Okay, you have to kill him twice.
[238:50.60]Got it.
[238:53.96]He's Message Marvin.
[238:56.18]It's day one.
[238:57.44]I want to read what people have to say.
[238:58.80]I'm going to kill one of these things.
[239:03.80]It's very angry.
[239:07.08]Is it going to explode?
[239:08.12]I think it explodes.
[239:14.07]They're all angry.
[239:17.45]Okay, so I've turned them all red.
[239:22.89]Interesting.
[239:25.95]I don't think I can... It's Metroid.
[239:27.79]Did they drop anything?
[239:30.12]They have a lot of health.
[239:32.64]They don't drop anything, really, so... I don't think it's worth killing everybody.
[239:46.20]Is he gonna come back to life?
[239:49.62]Yes, he is.
[239:59.17]Do it.
[239:59.51]Required ahead, and then try critical hit.
[240:02.19]Material ahead.
[240:03.03]Yeah, I already got it.
[240:07.94]That wasn't a backstab.
[240:12.12]Necessary item.
[240:13.12]Alright, well, I'm leaving.
[240:17.56]Goodbye.
[240:26.55]It's kind of cool.
[240:27.57]Kill them.
[240:28.09]Kill them all.
[240:30.77]I don't... I don't need to kill every single enemy.
[240:33.51]So let's go from here.
[240:39.36]It's definitely this bridge.
[240:42.72]It's the bridge right there.
[240:44.70]Kill them all.
[240:45.32]Kill them all.
[240:47.64]Wait until Sans makes you answer for this.
[240:53.95]What?
[240:56.58]Kill, kill, kill.
[240:57.82]Kill them all?
[241:01.08]I'll kill them all later.
[241:12.15]Don't, don't, don't.
[241:13.83]Wait.
[241:14.65]There are more.
[241:24.20]How come these ones are lit up but these guys aren't?
[241:30.05]Ooh, Godrick Soldier.
[241:31.97]Why are they all congregating over here?
[241:36.25]Is there a reason why they're all congregating around this stone?
[241:38.30]Are you slow as hell?
[241:56.00]They're all red again.
[241:58.08]Excuse me?
[242:01.89]Hey!
[242:12.93]Kill before he comes back, please.
[242:15.25]They get full health when they come back.
[242:16.69]Oh, that's fucking awful.
[242:18.72]Okay, it's the slow motherfuckers that drive me crazy.
[242:23.10]The guys that take, like, a hundred- Don't fall.
[242:25.00]It's okay, I'm safe.
[242:32.22]The guys that take, like, five seconds to swing the sword.
[242:37.49]You get me a guy that swings every half second and I'll beat him.
[242:43.85]Alright, so let me get back on the road.
[242:46.21]This is probably something I can do there later.
[242:47.45]That's a weird place.
[242:55.30]I have to get to another bonfire.
[242:57.34]Because I need to level up bad.
[242:58.86]This is back on the road.
[243:04.31]Okay, the golden trail is going this way.
[243:06.93]Nice, okay, awesome.
[243:13.73]Beautiful.
[243:21.75]Okay, I need to put my points into... Definitely, I need health.
[243:27.86]It's just a fact.
[243:29.60]I'm going to use this.
[243:37.64]Crush these.
[243:49.57]I'll get the 12 health.
[243:50.95]No.
[243:54.09]Yeah.
[243:55.50]My health is so bad.
[243:59.68]Get the crafting.
[244:00.32]Ooh, that's right.
[244:09.68]1,000.
[244:12.95]Alright.
[244:15.81]Sort chest.
[244:20.60]Oh, okay.
[244:20.94]That's cool.
[244:25.94]Add charge to flask.
[244:27.15]I have a golden seed.
[244:29.55]Awesome.
[244:31.11]That's very important.
[244:34.51]I'll do four and one.
[244:42.70]So now I need to do... How do I craft?
[244:46.56]Oh, I gotta go to that workbench.
[244:47.68]Right.
[244:47.98]Let me do that.
[244:54.55]Just started the stream.
[244:55.15]Have I missed much?
[244:56.59]Um, maybe a little.
[245:03.56]Nothing too crazy.
[245:04.68]It's been really fun so far, though.
[245:16.18]I'm going to upgrade, though.
[245:17.08]Flail.
[245:25.73]You missed him flailing at an optional boss for three hours.
[245:35.70]He killed five bandits and died a hundred times.
[245:37.74]Alright, let's go.
[245:45.48]I do +2.
[245:48.25]I need to do more damage.
[245:50.69]I'm going to go for the horse guy again.
[246:15.05]Steep and horse.
[247:02.56]I gotta, like, run around when he does that.
[247:04.14]Fuck that move!
[247:44.28]Oh my god, that stupid little move!
[247:47.16]That stupid little, like, wink!
[247:48.98]Come on, man.
[247:51.96]What the fuck?
[247:59.90]I think I probably could do it.
[248:02.88]Oh, that was so dumb.
[248:03.98]It's like I'm on the side, and he just, like, flicks his...
[248:15.18]Why not magic spam?
[248:16.11]I tried that already.
[248:17.83]He just moves too fast.
[248:18.57]They don't hit him.
[248:22.00]I'll give it one more hit.
[248:57.25]Yeah, I gotta get him off.
[248:58.45]I gotta get him off.
[248:59.69]Back off.
[248:59.97]You're in such a weird position here.
[249:01.13]Come on.
[249:04.39]That's such a weird spot.
[249:07.09]Come this way.
[249:26.34]My fingers are so greasy, I wouldn't have missed that if my pens didn't slip.
[250:00.18]oh my god he just moves around so fast I need to get on the horse three more tries alright
[250:37.55]Oh my god, how the fuck are you doing that?
[250:40.29]You're just glued to me.
[251:01.84]Huh?
[251:05.60]Excuse me?
[251:24.49]OH MY GOD, YOU FUCKING MAGNET!
[251:42.45]Dude!
[251:51.51]I jumped over that shithead!
[252:15.55]I...
[252:48.24]relax.
[253:29.62]I got it.
[253:31.32]I'll get him this time.
[253:35.62]We're not doing wolves.
[253:37.56]I'm just gonna... Okay, I got it.
[253:39.21]I got it.
[253:47.52]I'm just gonna be patient.
[253:48.56]We're gonna do just a horse fight, one-on-one.
[253:53.37]That's it?
[253:56.57]Horse fight.
[253:56.99]Jeremiah, is your name Jeremiah?
[254:02.29]No.
[254:04.75]He's fucking shit on me.
[254:10.54]Can I do a weapon art on the horse?
[254:14.42]Yes, okay.
[254:23.16]Um, hello.
[254:24.02]Yeah, nice job.
[254:25.48]Nice game you got here.
[254:26.82]That was fucking cool.
[254:28.14]Teleporting jumping lag guy.
[254:30.02]I can't see anything.
[254:45.01]Fuck, where are they?
[255:18.10]Yeah.
[255:25.39]Watch that stamina.
[255:26.09]I got to take it back up.
[255:27.09]This is a bad place to fight him.
[255:30.59]Back up here.
[255:31.11]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[255:34.19]This is the part that actually lags.
[256:24.74]Oh shit!
[257:11.78]Don't be stupid.
[257:31.13]Okay, we're alright, we're alright.
[257:32.45]You're good, you're good.
[257:43.01]We're gonna get away from the building.
[257:44.80]Get away from the building.
[257:45.58]Good night!
[258:01.45]Oh my god, I was playing this game so fucking wrong.
[258:06.89]I was playing the game completely wrong.
[258:08.61]Like the whole time I was playing the game wrong.
[258:10.26]I was playing the game wrong.
[258:15.02]Golden Halberd?
[258:18.75]What is that?
[258:19.27]Golden Halberd?
[258:38.33]That's kind of cool.
[258:40.03]Strength, though.
[258:43.19]Not enough.
[258:48.37]Scales with faith.
[258:49.35]That's so weird.
[258:50.03]I want to put it on and see what it looks like.
[258:51.05]Alright, so I was playing the game wrong.
[258:55.64]That's alright.
[258:56.06]Holy shit, this thing's huge.
[259:02.60]Wow.
[259:06.20]This thing is crazy.
[259:13.09]Look at how majestic that is.
[259:17.77]A raid?
[259:21.66]We did have a raid.
[259:22.86]DougDoug.
[259:25.88]DougDoug with a big... We had a couple of big raids today.
[259:28.54]Thanks, DougDoug.
[259:31.39]Apparently enjoying Elden Ring.
[259:33.27]I've... I lost to that horse boss like 15 plus times.
[259:40.99]I just beat him.
[259:42.31]If you don't know who the horse boss is, and you haven't purchased Elden Ring yet, let me give you some tips.
[259:51.44]Don't fight him with a flail on the ground.
[260:03.35]That's probably the best tip I can give you.
[260:07.01]I actually really like this.
[260:08.79]What's the weapon art?
[260:15.03]What?
[260:17.05]You just go like, hooray?
[260:26.05]Oh, not enough mana.
[260:26.71]Okay.
[260:27.97]What does it do?
[260:34.58]No, that doesn't do anything.
[260:40.60]What's its weapon arm?
[260:46.77]I don't think it has one.
[260:48.61]You need faith to use it.
[260:50.01]Okay.
[260:50.19]Alright, well, that's way too much equipment load.
[261:03.27]Cool.
[261:03.57]Alright.
[261:03.85]Well, that was fun.
[261:04.85]That was cool.
[261:07.17]This game is fantastic.
[261:13.59]I gotta stick with what I'm doing here, though.
[261:15.95]I'm going with point intelligence.
[261:19.42]The spells.
[261:19.86]Uh, I'm gonna go kill, like, one thing.
[261:27.82]Oh, crafting.
[261:28.38]Right.
[261:31.75]How do I do that?
[261:35.17]Where can I do the crafting thing?
[261:37.15]Well, you're back.
[261:41.63]I am of a nomadic people.
[261:44.21]Selling wares as I travel.
[261:46.82]End of the stream voice.
[261:47.70]What do you know?
[261:48.48]We're not even close.
[261:50.64]Not even close.
[261:51.78]Not even remotely close.
[261:52.82]Not even close.
[261:54.38]Who keep things from drying up entirely.
[261:57.54]Let's say you're a very welcome customer.
[262:04.90]Crafting items.
[262:05.68]Goodbye for now.
[262:08.58]So, do I smith?
[262:09.80]It's not the smithing table.
[262:19.93]There's a bug in my room.
[262:20.71]I'm too lazy to get rid of him.
[262:22.07]Any suggestions?
[262:22.85]Yeah, well, it's just a bug.
[262:29.96]Just, well, just open up your window.
[262:31.64]And, like, eventually the bug will fly out the window.
[262:36.89]Maybe we'll get the breeze of the air and we'll find his way out.
[262:43.35]I got a new one of these.
[262:48.78]Not Storm Stomp.
[262:49.60]Where is it?
[262:49.94]Didn't I get a new one?
[262:57.08]I did.
[262:57.82]Godrick Soldier asked.
[262:59.50]Two soldiers.
[263:00.27]Let's try it.
[263:06.73]Okay, cool.
[263:07.91]Very cool.
[263:08.67]I'm gonna go to where I was going before.
[263:10.36]Killed Mr. Horseman.
[263:13.60]Have you seen my pickle messages in the game?
[263:15.38]Yes, I actually have.
[263:16.66]Yeah, it has like 5,000 upvotes.
[263:26.01]Interesting, so it needs me- it wants me to go this way.
[263:36.17]Have I even fought the first boss yet?
[263:38.07]Or have I just killed two optional bosses?
[263:40.91]Has there even been a boss?
[263:45.69]No.
[263:47.33]Nope.
[263:48.57]Really?
[263:48.91]This game is boring like any Souls game.
[263:54.50]I'm just telling you, man.
[263:55.80]Like... You're saying that is... That's like... You gotta be careful with that take.
[264:15.95]Ooh!
[264:23.27]Stone sword, key, gargoyle, statue, tutorial bonfire.
[264:26.31]Let's go.
[264:29.49]See, if I didn't write that down, I wouldn't remember that.
[264:31.17]Let's go.
[264:32.19]I'm going there right now.
[264:41.62]Two notes in four hours.
[264:46.92]It's in here right?
[264:51.85]I'm taking my time through this.
[264:53.09]This game is so good.
[264:54.93]It's so fucking good.
[264:57.15]Can you be a reference for my job application?
[265:11.21]What are you talking about?
[265:12.15]No.
[265:19.72]What do you mean, D face?
[265:20.86]Why are you doing the D face?
[265:23.50]Alright, here.
[265:31.77]I actually think that the person that's app applying right now is a hard worker, gets things done on time, can work well with others, and has a pretty good head on their shoulders, I think.
[265:48.28]They're honest.
[265:49.94]they're um they're they're pretty PogChamp they're if you don't know that's what we do here at twitch.tv my name is Jerma985 by the way uh PogChamp means very good very good uh very cool very awesome excitable and I think they deserve a salary of 185 000 a year starting base salary by the way um what else
[266:21.61]I got a big zit back here.
[266:22.71]I don't know if you can see.
[266:24.87]It actually hurts a lot.
[266:26.33]And I tried to get rid of it.
[266:28.83]What a bad... I'm sorry.
[266:33.13]Where do your eyebrows go?
[266:38.59]Dude, it's dark in here.
[266:42.04]They're right here, man.
[266:43.60]Look.
[266:46.06]Look.
[266:48.06]It's just the lighting in the room.
[266:49.66]And I have a big eyebrow bone.
[266:52.87]Turn on the ring light.
[266:54.23]I'm not going to turn the ring light on and sweat my ass off in here.
[267:00.89]No, I'm not turning on the ring light.
[267:02.28]I don't want to.
[267:04.76]I want it to be, like, dark and mysterious.
[267:06.90]Not like, look, I'm in a studio.
[267:08.72]No.
[267:08.94]I'm taking away your Reddit shelf privileges.
[267:21.53]Alright.
[267:24.15]Congratulations on the job, by the way.
[267:25.45]Whatever it was.
[267:25.89]Oh, here we go.
[267:29.35]Use the key.
[267:29.94]Yes.
[267:34.82]What?
[267:34.98]I mean, not enough.
[267:38.80]How many do I need?
[267:42.59]I need more?
[267:50.05]It's two.
[267:50.71]Well, okay.
[267:54.75]We'll keep that written down.
[267:55.80]Does anybody in chat have a pet shrimp?
[268:10.15]What are you talking about?
[268:14.29]A pet shrimp?
[268:19.54]Alright, we're going over here.
[268:21.56]It looks like if I go up that way... Ooh, alright.
[268:34.07]Fight these guys.
[268:34.53]Alright.
[268:48.61]When you're with a party of like three of your friends walking through crossroads in WoW and a level 60 is just a dickhead and doesn't give a fuck about your fun time with your friends.
[269:02.88]Oh, let me do you one more.
[269:04.34]I'm not going to leave this spot for an hour.
[269:08.74]A full hour is going to go by and I'm not going to leave.
[269:13.42]Why do people just hate when other people have fun?
[269:15.22]Like just go fucking go herbalize or something, man.
[269:21.02]Okay.
[269:31.81]Ooh.

[270:10.14]Alright, alright, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, stop crouching.
[270:12.80]Not what I wanted to do, but that's okay.
[270:19.12]Dude, how many people are you gonna have?
[270:23.74]Like...
[270:25.86]There's no mana?
[270:26.64]What did I spend it on?
[270:28.50]Oh, shut up.
[270:49.57]I'm so sorry.
[270:50.23]These games just fuck with me.
[270:53.93]I'm probably so loud and irritating.
[270:55.35]I'm sorry.
[270:55.61]I know it's late, too.
[270:56.53]Is the game too loud?
[270:58.07]It looks like it's a little loud.
[271:02.59]Is it too loud?
[271:05.71]Not really?
[271:06.21]Okay.
[271:13.72]Who's still fighting me?
[271:17.62]Where?
[271:22.86]I don't know who's fighting.
[271:23.79]Who's attacking me?
[271:27.83]Oh, golden.
[271:28.85]Okay, that's how you get those.
[271:32.23]Alright.
[271:45.36]I feel like I need to be picking this stuff up every time I see it.
[271:50.06]I don't understand who's doing that.
[271:55.91]Who can see me from this far away?
[271:57.13]Where's it coming from?
[272:00.03]The guy in the back.
[272:15.15]He's just looking at me.
[272:21.22]Alright.
[272:22.08]I guess I got him.
[272:27.26]Oh boy.
[272:28.16]Watch out.
[272:30.62]Oh my god!
[272:31.38]Oh my god!
[272:58.26]Alright, just charge at him and just dodge every one, two, three.
[273:01.90]That is such, that travels so quickly.
[273:08.07]There's spiders in my hair, I think.
[273:09.85]There's bugs in my hair.
[273:10.49]Okay.
[273:32.86]Can I shoot it?
[273:33.44]Oh fuck!
[273:48.41]Don't do that if you don't know what it does yet.
[273:57.30]Oh my goodness.
[273:58.28]He's right behind him, just standing single file behind him.
[274:08.95]Alright, we're good.
[274:19.02]There are bugs all over your skin.
[274:32.54]Okay, so I could probably explore a little bit.
[274:39.44]I mean, there kind of are bugs all over you.
[274:40.74]Those little, like, dust mites.
[274:44.65]They're just literally crawling over your entire body.
[274:55.35]Why do people think that's... I mean, do people just go to every wall in the game and just say, hey, look, there's a secret here?
[275:02.81]You're wasting my valuable time.
[275:23.63]I should put one down.
[275:31.54]Alright, let's go.
[275:32.04]I'm going in here.
[275:48.83]A big ball is going to roll down this hill.
[275:52.05]It's going to be a pinball.
[275:55.91]I'm going to turn around.
[275:56.53]I'm going to have to run for my life.
[276:02.88]I'm telling you something's coming down there.
[276:05.04]It's going to roll all the way down.
[276:06.26]Do I have enough?
[276:14.91]I do.
[276:15.37]Okay.
[276:20.41]I don't know what I should be doing here.
[276:22.45]Should I do one in endurance probably?
[276:24.43]I feel like I'm not having a stamina problem.
[276:27.57]Maybe intelligence.
[276:33.70]Or keep doing decks.
[276:38.14]I should get it to 12.
[276:40.26]I really should.
[276:40.76]11 is probably way too low.
[276:51.29]LOL, he doesn't know about El Bolo.
[276:52.91]That's what I'm saying.
[276:57.00]Why is this golden?
[276:58.56]Summoning sign.
[277:01.88]Summon?
[277:03.10]Holy shit.
[277:07.81]Wow.
[277:12.75]Okay, I just, like, El Bolo.
[277:21.24]Oh, yeah, that guy, El Bolo.
[277:24.14]Oh.
[277:33.90]emboldened by the flame of ambition now this is boss alright make sure I'm not sweaty
[278:04.10]Even like just get so aware of your blinks.
[278:06.52]Oh, here we go.
[278:11.08]Margit the Fall Omen.
[278:15.98]Okay.
[278:22.21]He's got magic too.
[278:38.17]So he's a slow motherfucker as well?
[278:42.78]See you in another four hours?
[278:54.94]He's got a slow windup.
[278:56.38]Alright, well, thankfully it's right here.
[278:58.08]I could just spend a hundred hours here.
[279:14.79]How much damage did you want to hit him?
[279:21.30]That's a lot.
[279:22.58]It's worth it.
[279:27.97]Holy shit, that fucking wind-up.
[279:33.81]Oh my god, the wind-up, dude.
[279:36.79]Holy shit, my whole body itches.
[279:49.81]Holy smokes, alright.
[280:01.79]He's just using the home run bat on me, and it's just so hard to know when he's doing it.
[280:16.26]Okay.
[280:18.99]I gotta start memorizing his moveset.
[280:22.05]Skillfully.
[280:22.53]Back it up, okay, with this little ding ding.
[280:40.98]okay holy shit man can you stop attacking for a sec
[281:11.85]Oh!
[281:12.03]He's doing it so long.
[281:18.73]Out of mana already.
[281:19.95]Damn.
[281:20.37]Okay.
[281:20.65]Well, let's go two handed.
[281:38.78]Did I cut his tail off?
[281:42.38]Holy goodness.
[281:43.14]Oh!
[282:13.09]Holy... Fucking stop attacking!
[282:51.61]I think it's all about distance with this guy.
[282:55.99]Oh, come on.
[282:56.63]Really?
[282:58.23]I don't think he'd want to get away.
[283:06.65]Three out of five?
[283:07.49]What?
[283:15.05]You should... You should rebrand as the penis genius.
[283:22.75]I don't know what the fuck that's supposed to mean, but you made me chuckle for a second.
[283:28.51]Okay?
[283:28.83]Alright, keep going.
[283:35.44]I'm thinking you get a couple attacks in and run away like just get away yo let's get oh yo how are these guys
[284:10.38]A penis genius.
[284:11.50]I fucking hate that.
[284:15.53]And then you want to get the hell out of here.
[284:25.45]I'm thinking one attack and then you get back.
[284:27.83]Back up.
[284:33.16]That was stupid.
[284:40.48]Wait till he's done swinging attack and get in there and just... I'm not even playing the game right now.
[284:59.75]What?
[285:01.85]What was that?
[285:02.71]What was it saying?
[285:05.62]Oh, I had that selected.
[285:06.56]Okay.
[285:09.40]Actually, that's not a bad thing to do at the beginning.
[285:17.37]I will tell you right now, I don't think I would be betting anything at the moment.
[285:21.69]I don't know if you should be betting anything.
[285:28.01]I'm going to probably die like 30 times before I get him here.
[285:34.38]Okay, let's go.
[285:39.69]so so
[286:06.37]Easy, easy.
[286:07.05]Don't be an idiot.
[286:07.67]I hit him in the tail.
[286:42.92]Just run.
[286:43.38]Just turn around and run.
[286:48.22]Oy, that fucking wind-up.
[286:49.84]You're killing me here, man.
[286:51.12]Passing skills.
[287:14.92]It's like the, the changing patterns of just like a quick, quick slow, slow, quick.
[287:23.66]I'll get him.
[287:27.42]No breathing room.
[287:31.40]Will gamble when he rage quits the boss and comes back in an hour.
[287:35.64]No, that's not going to happen.
[287:38.46]I'm going to get him.
[287:41.31]Did you use the wizard?
[287:42.11]I'll try... Alright.
[287:43.93]I'll try one more time with the soldiers of... Let's start.

[288:58.09]Oh.
[289:14.36]Holy fucking moly, man!
[289:16.26]Well, now out of passing skill, warrior blood must truly rise.
[289:41.58]Okay, I don't have to dodge that.
[289:42.66]But he does the big windup.
[289:44.92]Oh my goodness.
[289:47.66]Holy fucking shit.
[289:51.25]What am I hitting?
[289:51.71]There's a fucking wall somewhere.
[289:55.67]Oh my god.
[290:02.60]Don't dodge it.
[290:05.77]um the problem with these games is when you do the I just jumped onto the ledge as Super Mario but I immediately jump again and fall to my death even though you made it to the platform uh I call it Mario ledge syndrome um happens all the time in this game
[290:32.00]I messed it up.
[290:34.38]Just kill me.
[290:34.76]Just fucking run off the edge.
[290:36.30]Run off the edge.
[290:37.10]Run off the edge.
[290:38.06]Fuck this guy.
[290:46.36]I didn't.
[290:47.04]I waited too long.
[290:53.93]Let's make fun of the VOD watchers so they skip this part.
[291:00.03]What are the... Hold on.
[291:03.29]Maybe the dogs are good here.
[291:05.09]Or the spellcaster guy.
[291:07.47]I'll try it.
[291:12.05]Noble sorcerer.
[291:12.81]Let's try it.
[291:20.56]And then... Wait, this is here now.

[291:56.65]Any good?
[291:59.98]I mean, I just walked into the fucking... These things in the ground have collision, of course, they do.
[292:03.16]I feel like I'm in fucking Gas Point again.
[292:06.78]Walking into gravestones.
[292:07.94]This is 11 damage.
[292:15.78]This guy sucks.
[292:31.84]This guy's not doing anything.
[292:34.16]If he could heal, that would be great.
[292:43.73]When he does the huge swing, just run, like, hey, go.
[292:47.25]Oops.
[292:48.03]Wasn't ready for it.
[292:57.02]Let him come to me.
[292:57.94]Don't just be an idiot here.
[292:59.18]Let him come to me.
[293:10.05]You gotta run around him when he does the long lines up.
[293:15.54]Gotta get behind him.
[293:16.62]Ah, it's so difficult when you're locked on.
[293:27.81]This is a wash.
[293:29.39]This one's over.
[293:35.68]Maybe not.
[293:36.66]I can do two.
[294:21.78]When he goes in the air like that and you're locked on to this motherfucker
[294:26.98]Your camera goes like this, and if I want to try to dodge through him, I go... I gotta fucking not lock onto him.
[294:36.60]Then you're gonna walk in the way that he jumps over you.
[294:43.05]And yeah, there's a jump.
[294:44.25]Do you understand how long it's gonna take my brain to understand that one?
[294:57.99]so so

[302:18.56]I mean, I'm fighting this boss.
[302:22.81]In... Oh, this is a rare occasion.
[302:27.73]I can't remember the last time a new tarnished made their way to the round table.
[302:31.71]I can't remember the last time a new tarnished... As your senior, I bid you welcome.
[302:38.70]It is safe here.

[303:26.70]I teach incantations.
[303:28.98]The strength granted us by the Two Fingers, and explore the secrets of the Golden Order, so that one day, if a tarnished of the Round Table hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them, ensuring order regains its proper form, writing rule over men.
[303:49.38]By the way, do you still see it?
[303:53.69]How come nobody's done... How come nobody's gone like this after a dialogue option?
[304:06.40]I'm kind of disappointed.
[304:10.93]I don't see it.
[304:13.24]Well, that's not going to be too hard.
[304:32.26]Oh, this guy, the Faith person.
[304:33.22]I see it.
[304:33.52]Incantation of the Two Fingers?

[305:14.12]Sorceress?
[305:14.70]Where are they?
[305:15.04]This is a cool place.
[305:27.19]We just got a forced break.
[305:28.21]I lost like too many times at the boss.
[305:30.10]So the game said, hey, why don't you go check out one of the other areas, bro?
[305:34.74]There's other stuff to see.
[305:51.43]Be sure to tell me if you meet a young woman named Lanya.
[305:54.43]Hey, Lanya.
[305:55.15]Hey, Lanya.
[305:55.61]Looking for Lanya.
[305:56.19]Write that down.
[306:25.39]OK.
[306:33.63]That is alright.
[306:39.85]Be sure to tell me if she's a servant, she's been like I've lost count of them, honestly.
[306:52.84]There's so much blood down here.
[307:15.07]Invaded.
[307:15.51]Oh shit, I got invaded.
[307:19.04]Mad Tongue Alberich.
[307:21.42]Is this PvP?
[307:43.52]Is this BM?
[307:44.31]This is not PvP, right?
[307:51.37]Fuck you!
[307:52.69]God damn it!
[308:00.92]Oh, dude!
[308:01.46]16,440 points of Pac-Man!
[308:02.46]Are you kidding me?
[308:03.02]I need to stand up.
[308:10.56]I'm having too much fun.
[308:13.69]Oh no.
[308:18.23]How do I get back there?
[308:29.10]I've died 55 times?
[308:30.34]Really?
[308:30.62]Let me try this again.
[308:35.86]Is there a bonfire I can sit at?
[308:37.02]I don't think so.
[308:38.74]Is that a huge bonfire?
[309:05.97]That's fucking ridiculous!
[309:22.48]I fucking hit him with the- Can I not do that?
[309:26.74]I parried that shit.
[309:28.18]I actually did.
[309:45.13]Put it in two hands.
[309:45.85]I'll get him.
[309:50.94]If he drops something cool.
[309:57.13]Oh, I know what to do.
[309:57.67]When he spawns, just spam this.
[309:58.69]Oh, fuck.
[310:39.64]I have a feeling I'm probably not gonna kill this guy.
[310:51.59]I got- if I can get a parry, I'll be okay.
[311:02.66]Oh my god, I got it!
[311:04.28]That's- nah, I'm not gonna fight.
[311:05.60]I'm not gonna be able to kill this guy.
[311:09.78]This is literally impossible.
[311:15.80]Literally impossible.
[311:17.16]Actually impossible.
[311:28.15]Alright, well, here's what we're going to do.
[311:29.35]I'm just going to start swinging in this room.
[311:32.31]No.
[311:33.19]What else is in here?
[311:33.73]There's a few other places to go.
[311:42.25]Cool.
[311:46.13]What do you mean?
[311:46.95]A house guest?
[311:55.28]If you were grieved at the notion you were but a visitant here, then you would do well to remember the first words of Grace given to you.
[312:04.15]Stand before the Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord, if those words held any meaning to you.
[312:12.78]Follow the guidance of Grace.
[312:15.18]Lay low the Shardbearers.
[312:19.50]graphics are incredible they really are the game just looks absolutely phenomenal and the doors to the round tables in the chamber will open and you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers okay once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own I'll impart to you a proper welcome this guy doesn't care member of the round table I have high hopes for you I'm sick and tired of them these namby-pamby time
[312:47.52]This guy's got such bad nerd neck, I really thought when we came in here, I thought he was sleeping.
[313:01.64]I thought his head was down, and I thought he was sleeping on the desk.
[313:12.37]Oh, okay, that's like 500 years of history I'm just destroying.
[313:25.50]Wild animal.
[313:28.04]Okay, cool.
[313:28.64]So we're gonna... I can't do anything in here until he... Until this guy respects me, I can't do anything.
[313:36.06]I gotta get the Two Fingers, come back.
[313:40.52]Where's the sorcerer at?
[313:41.48]There's definitely a sorcerer.
[313:46.57]Purchase.
[313:47.17]Ooh.
[313:53.83]Great rune.
[313:54.99]Request the aid of a hunter.
[313:57.43]Summoning.
[313:57.82]Increases memory slots.
[314:01.68]Stone and sword keys.
[314:06.38]Alright, this is where I have to make a decision whether or not I'm going to stay with the flail.
[314:12.52]The short spear might be pretty good.
[314:18.05]I don't want to use this.
[314:21.25]Scimitar might be good too.
[314:23.92]I feel like the flail is going to be fine.
[314:30.76]Pick on appearance of a host of fingers.
[314:34.51]Pick on appearance of a cooperator.
[314:36.07]What does this do?
[314:40.01]Deceives invaders.
[314:44.45]This is just to mess with somebody that invades?
[314:49.81]Okay.
[314:50.23]It's saying offer a bell bearing.
[315:04.94]Behold, Pear.
[315:10.87]Oh, hello.
[315:14.79]Okay.
[315:21.77]Ah, Edge.
[315:23.67]Can I talk at all?
[315:31.74]Oh, you're cool looking.
[315:32.82]It's a skeleton.
[315:37.03]Really cool.
[315:40.59]I need to drink some water.
[315:41.83]Yeah, we'll take a minute here.
[315:45.89]Let me just see if this sorcerer's person is here.
[315:47.83]Door's blocked.
[315:59.24]Did not go this way, though.
[316:05.46]You and I, we get each other.
[316:08.54]Ooh, blacksmith.
[316:10.06]Actual blacksmith.
[316:10.80]Okay, hold on.
[316:12.74]Ashes of war.
[316:15.54]Wild strikes.
[316:35.66]Definitely the... It's got to be the standard one.
[316:41.92]That's right.
[316:43.10]Asher 4 duplication.
[316:48.72]I put on more than one thing.
[316:49.94]I see you've noticed the chains.
[316:52.80]Nothing special.
[316:54.62]I'm a prisoner and these are my chains.
[316:57.56]I'm trapped by the hold.
[316:59.93]I'm dying, smithing for you fools.
[317:04.03]That's all there is to it.
[317:08.80]You're a prisoner.
[317:09.82]Alright.
[317:39.94]I gotta find the sorceress.
[317:43.94]Why is it always door?
[317:56.25]Oh, wow.
[317:58.15]Sorcery?
[317:58.53]Is that cosmetics?
[318:06.38]Oh, you can redo your character.
[318:10.13]Okay.
[318:11.31]That's interesting.
[318:15.31]Greetings, great champion called by Grace.
[318:19.25]I am fear.
[318:20.82]Circumstances have compelled my stay at the round table hold.
[318:25.36]You have spells on you?
[318:27.40]Would you allow me to hold you?
[318:30.23]No, every time we hold hands, we teleport to a different place.
[318:33.15]Blessing.
[318:34.11]Okay.
[318:34.23]I guess I'm going to let you just do this.
[318:37.32]Is he going to grab me?
[319:11.49]you are very warm what you felt light up inside you was a baldekin's blessing though it is but a fleeting thing I am afraid come back to me should you require another I will take you in my arms as often as you need is a buff or something what does it do
[319:44.14]Where is it?
[319:49.18]Alderkin's Blessing.
[319:51.04]Uses FP to temporarily boost poise.
[319:59.06]If it ever allows one to forget any aches and pains, in death there is only peace, for in death there can be no sensation.
[320:03.93]So what?
[320:06.43]I use it.
[320:06.97]It has one use.
[320:10.13]And it makes my poise go up, so I don't get
[320:14.84]You need that hug after dying 50 times to the horse guy.
[320:17.20]Okay.
[320:17.30]Interesting.
[320:20.41]I want you to teach me- I want someone to teach me spells.
[320:48.31]One more place I didn't go.
[320:54.58]Spellcrafter.
[321:06.10]Ah.
[321:07.42]Utility.
[321:13.22]Guy with the wood circle on his neck.
[321:16.42]That guy is...
[321:22.37]I just used it.
[321:23.47]What's in here?
[321:25.53]Stone sword key was lost with its use.
[321:27.33]Why don't I just open?
[321:33.74]Oh, no.
[321:34.64]Was this bad?
[321:37.96]Is a chest in here?
[321:42.80]Oh, fuck.
[321:44.02]It's a... It's time for us to do a little bit of a pivot here.
[321:55.51]I need strength.
[321:56.33]Yeah, the ghosts are other players, yes.
[322:02.41]They're in their own universe.
[322:05.16]Oh, great.
[322:06.54]That actually may have been a waste.
[322:15.16]I just got a crossbow for it.
[322:17.75]That's not good.
[322:18.39]I can buy them from the vendor over there.
[322:27.30]Alright, well, there's no sorceries, so that's kind of annoying.
[322:31.67]Probably have to go find them somewhere.
[322:37.11]Okay.
[322:42.79]Unless somebody in here does it.
[322:43.79]That I didn't talk to?
[322:47.69]I think I talked to everybody.
[322:57.37]Alright, so here's what we're going to do.
[322:58.39]I'm going to go pee.
[322:59.09]I'm going to drink a bunch of water.
[323:00.11]I'm going to come back, and I'm going to keep going.
[323:06.85]Because I'm... This is cool.
[323:09.12]This game's amazing.
[323:11.76]Really fun.
[323:12.08]Alright, I've got it back.
[323:17.24]I'm going to go pee, and we're going to play, by the way, a new song from Lordo.
[323:23.72]I got a few more.
[323:26.42]Let me know how you like this one.
[323:27.80]I'll be right back.
[323:29.92]Give me like two or three minutes.
[330:00.58]Alright, I am back.
[330:02.14]I've got a huge water.
[330:05.44]I've got a crunchy peanut butter Clif Bar.
[330:10.42]You better believe that we're not even close to being done.
[330:17.11]I peed, I stretched.
[330:20.05]I'll eat that Clif Bar over the next hour and a half.
[330:28.45]And we can get back into it.
[330:32.21]Turn this off?
[330:33.97]What happened to the music?
[330:38.09]Why did the music turn off?
[330:40.34]Oh.
[330:41.48]That's weird.
[330:44.36]It stopped.
[330:45.46]Oh, I didn't put it on a loop.
[330:46.38]That's my bad.
[330:46.84]Alright, let's go.
[330:50.78]Let's continue.
[331:08.83]I shouldn't have fucking looked at the preview.
[331:12.31]I shouldn't have looked at the preview.
[331:13.61]God damn it.
[331:15.39]Oh, I fucking ruined everything.
[331:17.07]Shit.
[331:18.43]I looked over at the preview and it was just... Oh my fucking god.
[331:21.97]That was... God damn it.
[331:25.75]I've ruined everything.
[331:26.41]It's fine.
[331:33.98]Uh, it took so much effort to try to not make any sound there.
[331:39.13]It's just so, it looks so bad.
[331:44.41]It looks weird.
[331:45.25]I look like a fucking cartoon character.
[331:53.10]Actually, it looks like good.
[331:55.02]What the fuck?
[331:57.70]No, it doesn't.
[332:11.11]Alright, I don't want to say anything.
[332:12.57]Okay, there's going to be people over the course of the next like six hours.
[332:17.62]I'm going to be streaming for like another like at least three or four hours.
[332:20.74]So over the course of people are going to come in and just think, holy shit, this dude's got like some really vibrant eyebrows.
[332:28.78]Whatever.
[332:31.04]It's staying on.
[332:36.75]It's just fucking weird enough where it's very bizarre looking.
[332:51.01]I think we're going to go for it.
[332:55.11]I'm going to go here.
[332:55.75]I want to investigate this.
[333:08.06]Did your eyebrows?
[333:08.66]Yeah, Holly did it.
[333:11.00]Holly did this.
[333:13.87]In like 15 seconds.
[333:18.05]How did you fail immediately?
[333:19.19]Because, dude, I look over and it's just like... It's such a... It's so jarring.
[333:29.58]Okay.
[333:34.38]Let's check out over here.
[333:44.45]Uh, whoops.
[333:54.36]I've got to kill that first boss today.
[334:00.69]Maybe the flail is not the way to go.
[334:03.09]But I'm kind of committed at this point.
[334:04.33]At least temporarily.
[334:05.23]Alright, so this is kind of the broken area here.
[334:12.88]There's something here.
[334:19.22]Yes, there is.
[334:32.61]Okay.
[334:37.29]Very cool.
[334:46.61]Is it like an impersonator?
[335:04.00]I really do look like somebody that looks exactly like me, but it's not me.
[335:07.46]Okay.
[335:18.79]Let's check over here.
[335:26.96]Really?
[335:27.32]Come on.
[335:34.48]I can't kill it now.
[335:37.36]I can't kill it now.
[335:44.36]Do I look like the unibrow guy from Jimmy Neutron?
[335:48.75]I don't know who that is.
[335:55.71]Alright, what's this?
[336:18.38]Okay.
[336:21.14]I can read your fingers.
[336:26.38]Okay.
[336:26.76]Alright, now.
[336:47.23]Here, Lucaria.
[336:49.49]Glintstone eventide.
[336:53.43]And reunite the half-crescents at the Grand Lift.
[337:00.37]Oh, but the bridge is collapsed and cannot be crossed.
[337:07.66]Only... why should that matter?
[337:14.29]Okay.
[337:24.84]No, don't touch me.
[337:36.04]Somebody all the way down.
[337:40.25]Ooh.
[337:47.18]Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook.
[337:50.20]Okay.
[337:51.20]Oh.
[337:52.87]Oh, shit.
[337:56.55]This ain't on the map.
[338:15.97]Guys, this ain't on the map.
[338:20.77]What the fuck?
[338:31.23]Are you kidding me?
[338:35.10]Don't go that far.
[338:35.78]Oh, there's a little cave right here.
[338:59.61]Weird, okay.
[339:00.11]I thought the tree was a monster.
[339:27.68]We're going a ways away right now.
[339:36.26]Where am I?
[339:36.80]Hopefully I get one of those transports.
[339:42.64]What's that?
[339:43.02]Okay, there's a lot of... Hold on.
[339:51.39]Okay.
[340:07.63]Okay.
[340:13.87]Pretty good.
[340:15.43]Thin beast bones.
[340:17.64]It's an HD texture pack Jerma.
[340:39.18]I feel like something's going to jump out and attack me somehow.
[340:41.78]I'm going to get off the horse.
[340:48.49]This has been way too quiet of a ride.
[341:07.09]Oh, shit.
[341:07.47]Oh, man, that... Liurnia of the Lakes.
[341:11.33]Oh, shit.
[341:37.79]Oh, that's my new weapon arm.
[341:39.45]Wild swings, right?
[341:40.41]Look over the ledge.
[341:55.15]Why is it always, don't you dare?
[341:59.13]Where am I?
[341:59.55]Applaud this message.
[342:00.45]Sure.
[342:24.10]This is just still going.
[342:35.03]More fruits.
[342:51.10]Break it.
[342:51.46]Alright, we're back in... Ooh!
[342:57.03]The golden thing is over here.
[342:59.71]It's actually pointing over here.
[343:04.09]Oh, no, it's not.
[343:04.53]It's pointing at the other boss.
[343:05.27]Alright, well, I found one of these.
[343:08.20]That's cool.
[343:32.24]works Andy hutch grass this is crazy look at this was I just there
[344:02.82]I was just over there.
[344:16.21]This is absolutely beautiful.
[344:30.67]I kind of feel like this is a high level zone that I shouldn't be in.
[344:37.44]Or something of that nature.
[344:46.08]Church of Irith.
[344:53.51]Whoa.
[344:59.09]Ah, finally.
[344:59.75]Sacred Tear.
[345:00.15]I gotta upgrade the flask.
[345:03.69]You're tarnished, aren't you?
[345:05.75]Then perhaps you could spare some runes.
[345:09.16]Believe it or not, I studied Flintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
[345:14.74]For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge.
[345:23.02]Well, bless you.
[345:24.38]Only ten, is it?
[345:25.54]You're a true saint.
[345:27.63]My name is Topes.
[345:29.39]Presume you're interested.
[345:31.43]I can teach you sorceries, as promised.
[345:34.21]Only, none of them are particularly great.
[345:39.23]What?
[345:42.87]Hold on.
[345:44.19]Give me a sec.
[345:48.45]Hold on.
[345:51.11]There's something on my face.
[345:55.53]This is better.
[346:00.40]Oh, Glintstone Pebble.
[346:02.42]Glintstone Arc.
[346:03.96]Starlight.
[346:07.88]Magic Projectile.
[346:09.46]Horizontal Widening Magic Arc.
[346:13.28]I gotta get some stones.
[346:14.46]Do I have any things like those crushed things?
[346:24.07]Not enough.
[346:27.65]Okay, well, I remember where this guy is.
[346:30.45]He's here at the church.
[346:41.56]Why is this guy sneaking up on this dude?
[346:46.99]Okay, well I got the Estus thing, which is a huge deal.
[347:04.26]What's that?
[347:04.80]There's so much to do.
[347:08.27]There's so many places just to go look at and explore.
[347:10.47]Okay, well, I know what that is now.
[347:20.15]Um... Okay, where do I go?
[347:26.24]Oh.
[347:41.80]it oh my god oh my god I should I should have done here are you going for the chewing world record it's a cliff bar they take 40 minutes to eat
[348:10.97]I want to... I still want to do with the... Let's go back that.
[348:12.79]There's something there.
[348:30.74]Academy scroll.
[348:34.64]Cool.
[348:37.68]Don't get stuck.
[348:39.06]No, I want to fight these guys.
[348:40.36]I want to be able to buy a Swiss Reef.
[348:49.05]It's a thousand runes.
[348:57.68]to buy the thing that I... And the thing is, my favorite part about being on Toy Story was the fact that I was constantly, constantly asked questions about, Tom, how do you do it?
[349:07.05]How do you actually get in that booth and be Woody?
[349:10.01]And my only thing I would say is...
[349:12.76]I just got in there and tried my hardest.
[349:14.46]And that's what I would think that everybody watching right now should also try their hardest too.
[349:18.78]Everybody needs to try their hardest and do their best.
[349:20.86]There's no reason not to ever not do your best.
[349:25.25]And... I kind of don't want to die right now yet because... It's gone.
[349:31.65]It's gone.
[349:34.71]It's so... When you get the Tom Hanks from eating, you get to have fun for like 15 seconds and then it's gone.
[349:40.97]It's kind of like lucid dreaming.
[349:46.81]If you are aware of Tom Hanks in your voice, you'll lose it.
[349:54.52]I gotta pay attention before I lose those souls.
[350:03.61]You guys are just casting.
[350:24.76]No!
[350:27.25]Nooooooo!
[350:31.51]Thank God.
[350:31.89]Is that Dex?
[350:52.52]Strength, and it's strength.
[350:59.62]Come on, all the cool things that I found have been, I can't use them.
[351:05.34]This thing's awesome.
[351:10.25]Okay, well, I don't think there's anything else here.
[351:18.91]I got, what's that, that academy scroll?
[351:23.87]Where is that?
[351:27.35]Give to a learned sorcerer to acquire... Ooh.
[351:31.67]Oh, that's huge.
[351:32.39]Hell yeah.
[351:36.84]Did I beat Margit?
[351:38.76]I did not.
[351:40.26]I... The lady came over and said, this game's too hard for you.
[351:44.64]And she put her hand on me.
[351:46.04]And we teleported to a banquet hall.
[351:51.50]Alright.
[351:52.18]I need more than that.
[352:07.31]I mean, they want you to do this, right?
[352:10.26]Why would it be like this?
[352:12.16]Well done.
[352:12.76]No, I mean like, but why would it be like that?
[352:15.00]They didn't want you to do that.
[352:30.42]I lost his soul.
[352:36.19]Oh shit.
[352:37.61]I'm wiping it off.
[352:40.43]Oh fuck.
[352:41.43]It's gonna start spreading.
[352:42.57]Hold on.
[352:46.88]It's like a unibrow.
[352:56.08]I can't get... I've spread it around.
[353:12.25]Hold on.
[353:12.65]Alright, that's better.
[353:20.88]I fixed it.
[353:31.92]Somebody said, Bert and Ernie.
[353:33.94]No, I can't do Bert.
[353:44.94]I want those sorceries!
[353:47.30]And I want them right now!
[353:48.44]Do you guys understand how fucked up I'm gonna look when this is off?
[353:56.48]It's gonna- I'm gonna look weird.
[353:58.28]I'm gonna look awful.
[353:59.12]It's gonna look jarring.
[354:00.14]Okay, I'm gonna give this scroll to him.
[354:14.70]Okay, study.
[354:15.22]How do I give him the thing?
[354:23.58]Apologies, friend.
[354:24.62]I'm afraid my meager sorceries are no match for your generosity.
[354:28.78]Oh, right.
[354:29.86]I can tell you what I know about this place.
[354:31.88]You've seen that structure to the north, towering over the water.
[354:35.24]Okay.
[354:35.60]That's the Academy of Rhea Lugaria.
[354:38.34]I gotta go there.
[354:38.84]We study glintstone sorceries.
[354:41.30]Only its doors have been closed for quite some time now.
[354:45.48]After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the shattering.
[354:48.78]The academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the capital.
[354:53.29]And the south gate leading here.
[354:55.67]As you might have guessed, the seals are still active.
[354:59.39]Making entry to the academy impossible without a glintstone key.
[355:02.92]Okay.
[355:03.28]So I'm stuck here.
[355:04.60]I need a glintstone key.
[355:07.86]With little chance of acquiring a key.
[355:10.44]When they cast the seals, I just popped out.
[355:15.49]And now I'm uprooted from my place of learning.
[355:20.89]Oh, the glintstone key.
[355:22.04]An extra one.
[355:22.32]Can I give him the scroll?
[355:23.26]Where are you in the game?
[355:25.04]I don't know.
[355:25.54]I just went in a random direction.
[355:51.58]I don't think I can give this to him.
[355:53.26]But I really want these.
[355:56.82]Really badly.
[355:57.44]Which one is good?
[356:00.34]Horizontal arc that spreads outward.
[356:02.42]This horse may cast repeatedly and while in motion.
[356:08.41]This is just light.
[356:12.69]And I think this is the... From the original game, right?
[356:21.73]This is a universal first step on the journey of true knowledge.
[356:24.15]I like this one.
[356:31.28]The one you have now.
[356:32.40]Is it?
[356:32.94]Glintstone Pebble?
[356:35.98]No, it's not.
[356:36.34]I have Magic Glintblade.
[356:44.33]How come he looks like the Grinch?
[356:48.57]Alright, well, I can't really do that.
[356:50.59]It wants me to go that way, but... I'm gonna go over here.
[356:58.86]Or here.
[357:00.12]Yeah, let's go here.
[357:03.20]Put a marker.
[357:04.32]I'm going over there.
[357:11.89]I don't understand how this is accentuating your chin.
[357:16.01]It's weird, I don't know.
[357:19.59]Notepad, notepad, I'm begging you.
[357:21.16]What should I write on it?
[357:22.22]I need glintstone key.
[357:42.73]Okay.
[357:45.11]Hey.
[357:49.43]Somebody said it looks like you're wearing fake teeth.
[357:51.47]Huh?
[358:00.37]Fake teeth?
[358:01.10]Is it because this looks weird together?
[358:02.76]Alright, this way.
[358:07.46]Let's get on the horse.
[358:15.10]Is that area over there with the big giant people?
[358:17.64]I'm going that way.
[358:18.77]Yeah, let's go.
[358:20.33]Because I can reliably kill them with the sorcery now.
[358:27.63]Yeah.
[358:38.31]These guys are not a problem now.
[358:40.67]Although, I might need...
[358:45.93]I'll get this guy at least.
[359:04.72]Might have to run around him a little bit.
[359:19.85]Alright, I'm out of... I'm out of mana.
[359:22.55]Goodbye!
[359:51.33]Oh shit dog Oh
[360:24.19]3D!
[360:24.23]Alright, I got it.
[360:31.15]Thousand and... Is that it?
[360:38.22]You should play Worms Armageddon.
[360:41.48]I don't know.
[360:42.64]Maybe.
[360:42.88]Maybe one day.
[360:49.46]I actually am not good at the Worms games.
[360:50.82]I'm pretty bad at them.
[361:04.59]Oh shit.
[361:05.91]Okay.
[361:11.42]This is pretty open.
[361:23.86]Coliseum?
[361:26.15]What?
[361:30.23]Where's the horse?
[361:34.69]I can't have the horse here?
[361:38.54]Oh no, that's bad.
[361:40.60]Where is he?
[361:45.06]Where is he?
[361:47.06]No horse allowed either.
[361:49.99]Oh my goodness gracious!
[361:51.25]Alright, I can beat this guy.
[362:15.04]That's horseshit.
[362:15.82]I hit him.
[362:45.24]I can get burnt by that fucking lava?
[362:48.24]Alright, he's dead.
[362:59.11]You... No.
[363:02.96]Alright.
[363:04.24]Invader defeated.
[363:07.24]Summoning other players.
[363:08.18]Use fur calling finger remedy to reveal summoning signs.
[363:13.81]Gold sign indicate an ally.
[363:15.13]Red signs are an adversary.
[363:18.23]Sure.
[363:20.67]Hammer talisman.
[363:27.17]Hammer talisman?
[363:28.24]What's up?
[363:37.94]I love you, Jerma.
[363:38.56]Just kidding.
[363:38.92]I'm sorry.
[363:39.36]What did you say?
[363:46.00]I'm sorry.
[363:46.46]It's always going to be funny to me.
[363:49.86]Is it an item?
[363:59.47]What is it?
[364:03.29]Oh.
[364:04.57]Enhances stamina-reducing attacks against blockers.
[364:07.51]I feel like it has read an AI sentence.
[364:10.35]Enhances stamina-reducing attacks against a blocker.
[364:20.46]Oh.
[364:23.38]Makes it easier to break guards.
[364:24.90]Okay.
[364:28.56]I kind of want to keep this on, I think.
[364:36.28]Alright.
[364:44.37]Oh.
[364:44.43]Somebody here.
[364:47.51]Competitive multiplayer.
[364:54.57]Small red RPG.
[364:59.13]This is like competitive PvP.
[365:03.22]What I wanted was to fight.
[365:04.10]To fight as a warrior to the last.
[365:05.80]So why?
[365:07.24]Why, oh guidance and Grace, will this door not open?
[365:09.12]I don't know, man.
[365:17.16]So this is what?
[365:17.56]Like a PvP zone?
[365:29.64]What about over here?
[365:48.63]I thought I had to get off Okay Door ahead door ahead hidden path ahead, you know, what's really kind of look at this Somebody did that look there's a secret door here Like that's already here
[366:13.66]Door ahead and look, hidden path ahead.
[366:17.81]Don't you... You're stealing this person's joke.
[366:21.99]And then this person is like, hey, by the way, there's nothing here.
[366:24.81]Just want to let you know.
[366:25.99]It's like... I feel like I'm reading a message board.
[366:35.06]29... Okay.
[366:39.60]He did it, but he did it louder.
[366:41.46]Yeah, it's...
[366:44.84]Oh, this is kind of cool.
[366:45.52]What's that thing?
[366:48.75]These, like, slugs?
[366:56.77]Fire slugs?
[367:01.13]Can I, like, come over here?
[367:07.35]Oh, fuck.
[367:07.67]I think it's gonna explode.
[367:12.14]Why are these here?
[367:26.06]Grave Violet?
[367:28.00]Smoldering Butterfly.
[367:30.40]Oh, there's a bunch of them!
[367:34.41]What?
[367:34.67]I got, like, I just hit, like, the jackpot.
[367:44.29]Alright, cool.
[367:44.69]I wonder what I can do.
[367:55.39]I'm going to go to that kind of beach area here where those giants were.
[368:00.01]But I need to get some more mana.
[368:05.63]Stop, you're killing them.
[368:17.32]I have enough to get the sorcery.
[368:20.26]But I'm not going to do that yet.
[368:24.16]In fact, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[368:26.45]Get off.
[368:31.91]Did you see the Sea of Thieves update?
[368:33.77]Yeah, dude.
[368:34.01]It was fucking crazy.
[368:40.44]No, sit back down.
[368:41.22]Three and two.
[368:48.54]That's better.
[368:52.13]Is that area with all the giants?
[368:53.25]I feel like I can get some good experience there.
[368:55.15]That was like here, right?
[368:59.18]Oh, I can change the marker.
[369:04.10]That's very, very useful.
[369:05.82]Okay.
[369:21.87]You're gonna play Deep Rock Galactic?
[369:23.27]I don't know, maybe.
[369:26.63]Probably not though.
[369:30.56]I never say I will not.
[369:37.07]Huh?
[369:51.59]What was that?
[370:01.52]Okay.
[370:01.70]There's so many wolves everywhere!
[370:29.63]Oh my god, I can't... I didn't even want to hit that one.
[370:35.96]That guy's got health!
[370:44.67]Is that a rare spawn?
[371:02.50]Alright, clean him up.
[371:40.98]What was that all about?
[371:41.72]That's it?
[371:45.16]Nothing?
[371:45.38]You didn't drop anything?
[371:46.12]Damn.
[371:50.19]Really?
[371:52.95]That was a cool encounter, too.
[371:53.99]Okay.
[372:03.53]Another statue over there.
[372:24.02]Oh!
[372:26.56]Hell yeah.
[372:27.82]Is this the game everyone's hyped about?
[372:32.60]Yeah, I'd say so.
[372:34.45]This is that game.
[372:43.25]I'm gonna go buy the sorcery... very, very soon.
[372:48.25]And I mean... incredibly soon.
[372:56.25]I want to see what this is.
[373:00.00]A geyser?
[373:03.50]Ooh.
[373:06.78]Will I die if I go down there?
[373:18.31]This is weird, and it's weird enough for me to want to do it.
[373:21.99]This is weird, right?
[373:23.03]Like, this is weird that it's here.
[373:24.96]There's got to be something down here.
[373:26.94]There is.
[373:27.20]Yep.
[373:28.44]Praise the rat.
[373:52.52]Alright.
[373:54.32]No?
[374:01.09]Holy shit.
[374:01.81]This is so pretty.
[374:04.03]Can't get over it.
[374:06.37]Okay, what about down here?
[374:07.31]Okay, well that's one of those... That's a slug that I can't hurt.
[374:33.92]Get him!
[374:34.56]No!
[374:35.26]Please!

[375:33.16]Oh, I love these.
[375:34.44]I love... Okay, I'll be right back.
[375:36.06]I'm taking this off.
[375:38.52]I look like a fucking idiot.
[375:49.42]You're my comfort streamer.
[375:53.61]Oh, you have a wife here.
[375:54.55]Let me see.
[375:55.77]Thank you.
[376:02.15]Gotta tell ya, you've all, you've all just been had.
[376:09.11]Yeah.
[376:09.35]Mm-hmm.
[376:13.41]Now look how weird I look when this is off.
[376:23.26]Oh no, I'm like ugly.
[376:35.32]Oh no!
[376:37.12]What happened?
[376:37.71]I had the GigaChad filter on.
[376:56.88]I was thinking about taking another break and filling in the beard and like giving like really long like angry eyebrows But it's like it's like 10 o'clock that was a joke for like four and a half hours ago Okay, that's good enough Oh shit look now I look like I don't look as good I need I'm gonna start doing that
[377:33.12]Save the stuff.
[377:34.89]Alright, let's go.
[377:36.40]I love these.
[377:36.82]These are like my favorite part of the game so far.
[378:02.59]We're both so awful, aren't we?
[378:08.29]Why am I just... Can I not hurt you?
[378:23.45]I hear something lumbering around.
[378:34.71]You're annoying.
[378:35.27]You know that?
[378:36.30]I'm gonna bleed.
[378:42.08]Put the brows back on.
[378:57.61]I'm not putting the brow back on.
[378:59.11]Alright, left or right?
[379:05.67]I'm gonna say... I'm gonna say right first.
[379:13.75]That's a pressure plate.
[379:14.69]I'm gonna step on that and the thing... something's gonna shoot at me.
[379:18.12]What happens?
[379:32.16]Shoot them!
[379:32.56]Shoot them!
[379:32.92]Shoot them!
[379:33.24]Shoot them!
[379:33.54]Shoot them!
[379:47.95]AH!
[379:58.68]It's so fucking dark I can't see anything!
[380:06.82]Alright, well, I was trying to get him to get killed by the thing.
[380:10.19]You should take the wig off now.
[380:16.73]I'm getting gamer elbows.
[380:18.08]You guys ever get that?
[380:20.36]Where your elbows have been on your armrest for an entire day?
[380:39.84]I don't even give him a chance.
[380:45.64]Just go.
[380:46.40]Just kill, fight, fight, fight.
[380:50.43]Did I not pick up my... Up here.
[381:02.70]I would have been ashamed if I didn't get those.
[381:10.39]Okay, this time, don't be stupid.
[381:12.11]They fire straight out.
[381:17.28]Just don't step on it.
[381:19.30]Use your casting abilities to take out these shitheads.
[381:32.93]Okay.
[381:41.22]Like this ceiling, right?
[381:42.02]They're going to be behind me.
[381:45.18]I even knew you were there, too.
[381:54.42]This is another door.
[381:55.32]Alright, so that's... Very obviously, that's where the boss is.
[382:02.44]The little mini-bosses.
[382:03.74]Alright, I forgot...
[382:14.68]You, dude.
[382:35.51]No.
[382:46.34]Don't step on the pressure plate.
[382:56.38]Alright.
[382:57.54]So, we got Smithing Stone.
[383:00.60]Very cool.
[383:01.20]I need those.
[383:03.16]Root resin again, and now we can open up this thing.
[383:06.26]Cool.
[383:11.95]Cat's slow.
[383:13.75]Um, I think... If I, you know, this... I would imagine a lot of people are potentially, uh...
[383:21.37]potentially have this stream in a tab on a different monitor while they are playing through Elden Ring at the same time.
[383:28.97]That's what I would do.
[383:29.79]I would do that.
[383:31.81]Maybe you got me on in the background.
[383:33.19]Maybe you're playing.
[383:37.81]No?
[383:38.05]You're probably busy.
[383:39.39]And every so often you're looking over here to see just how much further you are than I am.
[383:43.59]Which, I hope you're doing a good job gaming.
[383:48.91]I think I'm going to reset it, because that's definitely a boss.
[383:54.08]I actually think I'm gonna go buy the new sorcery thing and level up once.
[383:58.18]Because I'm kind of terrified of this.
[384:05.64]I'm smoking crack.
[384:06.56]Fuck video games.
[384:07.46]Well, I've been... Okay.
[384:10.29]Oh, here's time?
[384:11.29]Yeah, you shouldn't be doing that.
[384:14.17]I'm gonna level up intelligence.
[384:19.39]It's not gonna be enough...
[384:26.66]Can I not travel to the site of Grace from this location?
[384:29.32]Can I travel back here?
[384:30.52]If I'm outside the dungeon, can I teleport inside the dungeon?
[384:36.80]Okay, I can.
[384:41.72]Just making sure...
[385:00.18]go in there I'll buy the I only have enough for one which one do I want do I want the default spell or do I want the arc spell back to learn another why of course
[385:30.40]I don't know.
[385:35.34]R is a horizontally widening magic arc.
[385:40.08]This one has more intelligence required.
[385:42.08]1.30 in the morning and you're still going.
[385:47.93]I'll be going for at least another... I'd say at least another probably hour or two at least.
[385:54.69]Can I afford both?
[385:55.33]I want to level up though.
[385:57.24]Yeah, I guess I'll just get there.
[385:58.08]Whatever.
[386:05.00]And now I have to go tune them, right?
[386:09.74]Come back.
[386:21.33]Okay, let's get to a bonfire.
[386:29.43]Pebble will carry for a bit.
[386:30.59]It's fast and spammable.
[386:32.47]Ooh.
[386:33.39]You like the game?
[386:34.17]I think it's absolutely phenomenal.
[386:38.00]So far, I keep finding new things to do.
[386:41.52]Let's try this spell.
[386:52.87]I sort of just keep finding stuff to do.
[386:55.01]That has nothing to do with the main game.
[386:58.88]Okay, let me see.
[387:02.54]Yeah, this is that spell.
[387:04.64]The original kind of just little cat.
[387:06.01]And it's quick, too.
[387:06.79]So now I can actually use this.
[387:12.59]Oh, are you kidding me?
[387:13.75]I wish I had this like an hour ago.
[387:15.19]What about this one?
[387:17.81]Wow, that's good.
[387:20.43]Hell yeah.
[387:21.63]Okay, now we're actually working.
[387:23.25]Now we're actually playing the game now.
[387:26.17]I want to allocate more mana.
[387:38.12]That move is really good.
[387:39.50]Alright, let's go.
[387:46.16]Go back.
[387:47.50]I forgot that they drop down.
[388:05.44]What direction am I firing this at?
[388:20.45]Nice.
[388:20.77]Alright.
[388:22.61]Wait a minute.
[388:23.03]Didn't I, um... Oh, I can use the tear.
[388:28.60]Use sacred tear to increase the amount of HP and MP.
[388:31.42]Uh, whatever.
[388:31.84]Yep.
[388:34.06]Very, very important.
[388:41.47]Alright, this time, don't mess around.
[388:53.88]Damn, it's good.
[388:55.22]It's good.
[388:55.70]I think we're doing a hard pivot back... Hard pivot to casting.
[389:00.88]I wanted to do Astrologer at the very beginning, and I think it was the right call.
[389:06.97]But, I do like the ability to be able to use my melee, too.
[389:14.71]Alright, let's go ahead and open the door.
[389:18.34]Please don't step on that.
[389:44.52]I could just run by these guys.
[389:45.90]Well, let's see if I can kill this guy first.
[389:55.86]Alright, let's do it.
[389:59.47]Okay.
[390:08.41]Brave Warden Duelist.
[390:13.05]Whoa.
[390:14.08]That hurt.
[390:47.30]Whoa!
[390:48.00]What hit me?
[390:48.56]Oof!
[391:18.15]Oh, I'm out of juice!
[391:19.03]Sorry, I gotta... Alright, he's not bad, he's not bad.
[391:36.51]He's not bad.
[391:39.57]So I like wasted a lot of... Alright, I wasted a lot of shit on that.
[391:42.83]Okay.
[391:49.90]So, we just run.
[391:50.86]We're just going to sprint over there.
[391:55.68]Forget about these guys.
[391:57.22]It's just a waste of time.
[391:59.40]This way.
[392:06.97]Okay, let's go.
[392:07.49]Oh, there you go.
[392:12.55]Please.
[392:15.11]Let's get it right at the bat.
[392:45.70]Wow that hitbox is crazy
[393:07.57]You!
[393:08.61]Ah, he's in... He, like, does this, like, fucking Overwatch ult.
[393:13.73]Where he, like, jumps in the air and he stays up there for way too long.
[393:17.67]Instead of coming, like, jump down, he goes, like, jump down!
[393:22.30]Is it Devon, chat?
[393:34.22]That'd be insane.
[393:35.34]Hey.
[393:36.98]You can backstab him?
[393:38.06]Ooh, okay.
[393:43.36]I'm just getting way too jumpy.
[393:46.58]When he goes in the air, you gotta wait.
[393:57.31]There we go.
[394:05.72]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[394:51.18]Oh, bad move to do that right now.
[395:05.23]I'll see you later.
[395:05.71]It's over.
[395:06.05]Bye.
[395:11.22]Casual man.
[395:12.66]Casual mancy.
[395:20.16]I... Hey.
[395:22.53]I got in there.
[395:23.87]I had to dodge a shitload of times.
[395:25.49]I hit him with my flail at least like 10 to 20 times.
[395:29.65]Too bad I got another weapon that's probably incredible that I can't use.
[395:40.78]Look at all this cool shit that I can't play with.
[395:49.36]That's the weapon art.
[395:57.89]Oh, it's that.
[395:58.51]This is so heavy, yo.
[396:04.35]Well, that was awesome.
[396:08.75]Um, I gotta get my souls.
[396:12.14]Strength getting all the cool gear again.
[396:14.30]I don't even have any souls.
[396:17.52]Should've just chose the caveman.
[396:25.32]No, I mean, the battle... the kind of battle mage stuff is really cool.
[396:29.90]I would like to get a dex weapon that I think is a little more comfortable to me.
[396:38.82]Can I open this?
[396:46.96]People need to get out of the strength or dex build mindset.
[396:51.74]I mean, I'm trying to do kind of a half and half.
[396:56.38]Casting and dex.
[396:59.42]Dex increases your cast speed, so... It's going to be pretty useful.
[397:05.33]Okay, well that was cool.
[397:20.25]What platform is this?
[397:20.97]It's on PC.
[397:22.81]PC, I don't know if the same is on console, but PC currently has kind of a weird problem where sometimes a game will just hang and slow down and speed up.
[397:32.88]I'm imagining that over the next maybe even a few days or week or something, maybe they'll figure that out.
[397:40.88]But regardless of that, it still is really, really fun.
[397:50.69]I'm going to do the next point into, uh, vitality.
[397:55.46]And then I'm going to try to fight that boss again.
[397:58.16]Going for the boss again.
[398:10.99]Reduces fall damage and sound.
[398:15.07]Animal rain- what is it?
[398:16.49]Animal rainbow?
[398:21.18]Alleviates blood loss?
[398:22.34]Okay.
[398:22.64]So let's head back to... I want one more point in vitality.
[398:31.31]And then I'm gonna go kick the shit out of this guy.
[398:37.83]I haven't been down here.
[398:38.69]Yeah, I'm gonna go that way.
[398:42.18]Just for a minute.
[398:46.70]How come everyone's playing Elden Ring?
[398:48.60]Um, because it's, I don't know, we only get one of these every, like, three or four years?
[398:56.45]I think I'm, I don't want to do that though.
[399:08.15]There's probably such a, there's probably a better staff.
[399:09.57]I don't want to do that.
[399:24.57]It's the Olympics of video games.
[399:26.01]Yeah, I mean, just every three or four years, they make one of these.
[399:29.87]And they keep making them more and more interesting.
[399:39.08]I'm going to do three and two.
[399:45.50]Let me see if I can beat him now.
[399:46.92]I'm just going to go for it.
[399:51.41]That's a cool lake over there.
[399:53.27]And there's something cool here, too.
[399:56.67]Let me see if I can beat him.
[400:08.64]Are the cats in the game?
[400:10.32]Oh, well, maybe.
[400:12.88]Wait, no, I'm not ready for that yet.
[400:15.58]Let me level up Vitality one more time.
[400:33.84]Okay, this shit's fucking insane I'm gonna be able to clear whole just waves of enemies
[401:12.71]Free and Beast Surcoat.
[401:14.43]Ooh!
[401:18.49]It's the thing that they wear.
[401:24.93]Still rolling just fine.
[401:27.92]I keep hitting select to do that.
[401:35.14]Definitely these.
[401:36.64]Okay, versus physical, that's way better.
[401:43.83]I can't wait to take off this helmet.
[401:45.04]I hate it.
[401:45.36]Alright, that's enough to do vitality, and then I'm gonna go for it.
[401:59.78]I hope he hasn't had water the whole stream.
[402:01.50]I hope that salad is all he got.
[402:04.34]Wait, what?
[402:10.65]Thanks for the reminder.
[402:16.56]You look like an 1800s scuba diver.
[402:25.27]Alright.
[402:26.57]Vitality.
[402:29.17]Very good.
[402:34.09]Do you know how much I can cheese the hell out of this?
[402:38.69]I can summon the soldiers and just sit there and just spam cast spells at them.
[402:47.21]Would you guys call me a bad gamer if I did that?
[403:00.30]Let me see if I can do it without them.
[403:02.95]Yes, but it would still be kind of cool.
[403:04.69]Let me see how well this plays out without them.
[403:15.53]Thank you.
[403:41.40]I THINK WE GOT A BUILD THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO WORK WITH HERE, LET'S GO!
[403:50.33]I just don't know why somebody... Is this gonna take away your first try Jevil card?
[404:05.04]That's not fun.
[404:06.39]Come on.
[404:10.43]I'll get him, I don't need any more help.
[404:13.85]You go... Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[404:18.85]Swing, swing, swing, back up.
[404:36.94]I hate that fucking move so much!
[404:39.59]I'm using it as a crux right now.
[404:41.67]I'm using... Okay.
[404:44.03]Sorcery is awesome.
[404:45.88]But sometimes when you start to play with like a sorceress, you just kind of go like this.
[404:52.34]Oh, right.
[404:53.05]I have... This is a game... I can't get hit.
[405:02.76]The two or three times that I played through Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 3 with sorcery, I remember getting to bosses, getting them to like 5% health, and just getting lazy and just still spamming.
[405:13.97]And just losing.
[405:16.51]You gotta pay attention, still.
[405:42.20]Alright, it's... he just moves in fucking slow motion, it's so annoying.
[406:05.34]I fucking hate this guy.
[406:07.74]I would rather have to dodge 50 attacks a minute than have the guy go in slow motion.
[406:18.84]Smash!
[406:38.45]I'll get him.
[406:38.91]It's just I haven't been here in like an hour and a half.
[406:43.28]I just like gotta get back on the bicycle.
[407:19.18]I told you sorcery fucks.
[407:21.59]Okay.
[407:45.47]Please!
[407:46.17]Oh!
[408:14.60]I'm trying not to dodge that much.
[408:17.14]It's just like... Sometimes your brain just goes like, do it again, do it again, do it again, do it again.
[408:24.43]And I'm just like, no, stop.
[408:26.81]Don't press that fucking button a third time.
[408:28.97]Alright, okay.
[409:07.52]What did he... the gap closed?
[409:17.52]These foolish ambitions took place.
[409:37.68]Use the weapon art?
[409:39.83]This thing sucks asshole.
[410:21.34]He hits me with that little swing every single time.
[410:25.04]He takes forever to do fucking every other move.
[410:48.51]greedy too greedy and I fucked it all up
[411:27.50]You punk!
[411:48.22]This like hurt my voice.
[411:50.18]Somebody said something stupid.
[411:54.16]Somebody said, did they say, bro, look at the, hold on.
[411:57.43]Bro, look at that boss's toes.
[412:00.33]What's, what's wrong with them?
[412:02.53]What are you talking about?
[412:03.55]I gotta just be patient, man.
[412:12.81]attacks whatever the next boss is if it's even 10 faster than this guy it's not gonna take me that long
[412:54.17]Goddammit!
[413:09.55]Well... Now what of passings?
[413:34.02]I'm dead.
[413:41.41]Bleh!
[413:54.11]Need to jump more?
[413:54.95]Stop telling me to jump.
[413:56.17]Because last time I did that I got killed.
[414:01.72]I'm gonna beat him tonight.
[414:02.96]I'm gonna beat him before I go to bed.
[414:05.25]You bet your ass I'm gonna.
[414:30.85]IT TAKES SO MUCH FUCKING LONGER!
[414:32.79]I KEEP TRYING TO WAIT SO LONG!
[414:37.89]Oh my god, I fucking hate this guy.
[414:42.39]It's like, one, two, three, four, it's like, god damn it, I... That was a good start too.
[415:08.93]Thank you.
[415:43.19]Ah!
[415:44.65]Ah!
[416:10.17]This guy's F-tier.
[416:12.17]Like, on the very bottom of the Dark Souls boss tier list.
[416:14.73]He's literally F-minus.
[416:18.00]He's F-zero.
[416:19.58]F-zero plus.
[416:50.52]You're turning blue.
[417:10.27]You were better at this game with the eyebrows.
[417:12.07]God.
[417:20.54]Let's go.
[417:21.00]I'm beating him right now.
[417:55.93]This guy gives me so much trouble.
[418:00.05]It's just all the speed changes.
[418:10.49]Is it too, is it too, I can't do a refund?
[418:21.14]It's the speed changes, and it doesn't matter how many times I see it.
[418:24.75]I think it's faster than it is.
[418:27.79]So, look at me.
[418:29.37]Listen to me.
[418:30.41]Wait another full second before you do fucking anything.
[418:33.45]His swings are always a full second.
[418:35.58]You understand?
[418:37.58]It's like full two seconds longer than you think it is.
[418:50.33]Thank you.
[419:19.13]It's a fu- Count more!
[419:21.13]Count more!
[419:49.80]Thank you.
[420:20.23]Well, now out of passing skin, the warrior blood must be truly baptized.
[420:37.38]Tarnished.
[420:41.53]I'm gonna punch this fucking guy in the face in real life.
[421:07.92]If I was there, if I was there, I'd kick, I would kick the shit out of this guy.
[421:13.38]I'd just, I'd get up on him, right?
[421:14.80]I'd get up on him and just like, like I'd just fucking flurry this guy with a bright red face.
[421:23.39]I would have a bright red face and I would just be like, I keep getting to like 50, I can't, I keep getting to like 50%.
[421:50.94]What is this fucking travel?
[422:13.30]Well, thou art of passing skill.
[422:33.49]Warrior blood must truly run in thy veins.
[422:51.97]Let me fucking get give me a second So
[423:22.14]Oh, no.
[423:55.99]Focus on the tail.
[423:56.59]That's how I beat him first try.
[423:57.85]You're a liar.
[423:58.65]You didn't beat this guy first try.
[423:59.63]You're a liar.
[424:05.45]You're a liar.
[424:26.98]Thank you for watching.
[425:18.59]When he gets to the phase two and he does like the six fucking moves in a row it's just like one two one one two one two throw throw throw one two one.
[425:31.21]Too greedy?
[425:31.69]Yeah I know I know I know.
[425:34.32]I know.
[425:39.40]How many tries until you win?
[425:41.66]I don't know.
[425:42.00]I probably should have fucking threw this flail into the ocean.
[425:47.20]Because, like, fuck all it's doing me here. ...
[426:14.08]That was the wrong button.
[426:17.26]What a disaster.
[426:59.98]oh my god
[427:23.17]I'm so fucked here.
[427:26.57]I couldn't dodge?
[427:38.27]Parge your spells for more damage?
[427:45.44]I wish I could just move around faster.
[427:51.82]Magic is- No, magic is good.
[427:55.11]I keep getting to like 50-40% health.
[427:58.07]And then I just- I just fall off.
[428:00.35]Because I run out of mana.
[428:02.11]And I'm using a fucking like- A pencil sharpener.
[428:05.75]For a weapon.
[428:06.21]Okay.
[428:42.47]Get away from the wall!
[429:02.92]I
[429:35.80]Let's go.
[430:02.17]What the fuck?
[430:03.27]I dodged.
[430:03.75]What the fuck, man?
[430:05.03]I got him like 45% like 10 times in a row.
[430:32.05]I'm gonna javelin this fucking flail as far as I can when I'm done with this.
[430:54.37]My fucking hair is in my eyes.
[430:56.03]Just kill me.
[430:57.55]Kill me.
[430:57.89]And I'm bringing the boys next.
[430:59.27]I'm bringing the boys next.
[431:09.99]I'm bringing the fucking boys.
[431:20.41]I'm like...
[431:25.76]Okay.
[431:30.22]You know what?
[431:30.58]I'm throwing this old guy in the ocean too.
[431:32.36]Alright, let's go boys.
[431:48.85]You know what to do.
[431:50.21]Stand there and get hurt while I cheese the fuck out of him with magical potion spells.
[431:59.27]so so so
[432:34.54]I gotta stack the bleed, too.
[432:53.89]Oh, get him!
[432:54.49]Stab him in the mouth!
[432:58.99]Alright, boys, stack on him!
[433:00.63]Stack on him!
[433:01.21]Don't let the fucking raid leader die!
[433:02.99]Don't let the raid leader die!
[433:26.74]Hey, let's do the rest of this with my fucking eyes closed.
[433:28.54]Don't make a joke!
[433:29.38]Stop!
[433:38.20]Why did I do that?
[433:39.17]Why did I do that?
[433:39.71]I was gonna make like a joke where I was gonna close my eyes and cast a spell at him.
[433:42.99]What the fuck are you doing?
[433:45.03]What am I doing?
[433:46.85]Why would I do that?
[433:50.99]Why would I do that?
[433:51.71]What was the point?
[433:52.56]Why would I do something like that?
[433:54.90]Why would I do that?
[433:57.00]Why?
[433:57.94]Why?
[433:58.20]I was over.
[433:59.06]I fucking beat him.
[434:01.62]It's not... You're not funny, okay?
[434:04.08]You're not funny.
[434:05.28]You're not funny.
[434:07.16]Just beat the fucking boss.
[434:08.74]Just beat the boss.
[434:09.44]Like, nobody would have laughed.
[434:10.82]Literally, you're not funny.
[434:12.38]Nobody would have laughed at you.
[434:14.35]Alright, bring out the boys again.
[434:15.67]Let's go.
[434:37.74]Down.
[435:03.35]Thank you.
[435:36.42]Are you kidding me?
[435:37.34]I'm so stupid.
[435:39.38]I'm so stupid.
[435:40.30]Why?
[435:42.34]Why?
[435:42.98]I've played these games so many times.
[435:45.22]You can't be a cocky dick and ruin everything.
[435:50.95]Like, you do that.
[435:51.97]You celebrate after the fight.
[435:53.85]Not when he has one hit left.
[435:55.37]You don't go like, oh, look at this.
[435:57.20]I'm fucking hilarious.
[436:00.00]What a fucking idiot.
[436:01.72]I'm so mad at myself.
[436:05.42]That was truly the stupidest thing I've done all year.
[436:08.80]It's probably like the last year.
[436:24.39]I'm on like full tilt now.
[436:27.59]Like I was doing so well.
[436:29.20]I dodged like 10 of his attacks in a row.
[436:32.74]What a
[436:43.13]I really have to unbind and fucking crouch to dismount from left stick.
[436:48.35]That's such an awful place for that to be.
[437:06.70]Nice job, boys.
[437:07.42]Nice job.
[437:17.83]Can you not get hit by that fucking move?
[437:19.91]I feel like that move is like, if you're near him, you just get hit no matter what.
[437:25.35]I'm so fucked.
[437:32.09]Fuck.
[437:37.05]I don't know what I'm doing.
[438:07.17]I'm sorry.
[438:23.28]I'm so sad
[438:49.66]I can't fucking believe it.
[438:51.64]I fucking can't believe it.
[438:59.49]I can buff the staff.
[439:00.69]No, I can beat him.
[439:04.19]I just put on the tier list.
[439:07.29]Look at how funny this guy is.
[439:09.92]Overbeating the fucking goddamn boss.
[439:24.65]Just run off.
[439:29.45]Run off.
[439:29.67]It's not gonna... Jump off the cliff and reset your karma.
[439:47.28]Just pull over and ask for directions.
[439:54.92]Alright, this is the one right now.
[439:56.42]No more fucking around.
[439:57.46]I'm not going to be a dickhead.
[440:00.53]I'm going to beat this stupid ass guy.
[440:03.11]Alright.
[440:26.82]Out of mana already?
[440:27.68]What the fuck?
[440:41.35]I gotta build up the bleed on him.
[440:54.94]You dude fucking leave me alone for one second Oh
[441:32.34]You know, you got another guy next to you, you know...
[442:03.79]Maybe parried?
[442:04.37]I mean, that's a great question, but maybe I'll try it.
[442:13.62]Okay, how I staggered him before, I think I hit him like three times in the face.
[442:26.73]I can't fucking believe it.
[442:33.95]Oh!
[442:57.64]Well, that was a passing scare.
[443:02.80]Warrior blood must...
[443:25.60]GET HIM BOY!
[443:34.66]OHHHHH, THAT WAS WEIRD, MAN!
[443:43.10]COME ON COME ON COME ON COME ON COME ON COME ON COME ON COME ON!
[444:17.36]DON'T GO OFF THE FUCKING CLIFF!
[444:24.02]Thank you.
[445:13.74]Why is B don't... I'm pressing B and it won't fucking do anything.
[445:18.58]I'm getting like weird input lag.
[445:24.10]I'm so fucking dead here.
[445:37.11]I can't.
[445:37.61]I'm so fucking annoyed.
[445:39.07]I can't fucking believe I haven't killed him yet.
[445:42.71]Okay.
[445:45.52]When he does that move, when he does like the swing, swing, swing, stab into the ground, he hits me with it every single time.
[445:52.96]he hits me every single time like I'm trying like dodging left dodging right like dodging away he still hits you with it and I swear to god sometimes I press b and dodge and I don't move I just kind of stand still it's weird
[446:44.76]Really?
[446:45.12]How did I not dodge through that?
[446:46.42]Fucking horse shit.
[446:58.18]I'm trying to stagger him somebody said I could a heavy attack will stagger what a bad time to heal idiot
[447:27.32]Shit, I think that staggered.
[447:47.54]See, how do I... I can't get away from that.
[447:50.28]I'm dead again.
[447:57.85]so so
[448:25.58]Thank you.
[448:50.97]Oh my god!
[448:52.31]Why is he giving me so much trouble?
[448:54.47]You've seen me play through Sekiro.
[448:56.93]Dark Souls 1.
[448:57.87]Dark Souls 3.
[448:59.55]I want to fucking throw this guy over the edge of the world.
[449:02.05]I don't know why this guy's doing it to me.
[449:08.63]Am I underleveled?
[449:13.52]I don't think so.
[449:14.84]I did a lot of the side stuff.
[449:25.68]I blew it already.
[449:27.03]Oh, I'm alright.
[449:37.43]Oh my god.
[449:38.59]Damn it, dude.
[449:39.65]Fuck off.
[449:45.96]I'm telling you right now, I pressed B and I didn't dodge it.
[449:52.32]Start again.
[449:53.10]Bridge if you do it.
[449:56.20]Change spells?
[449:56.90]I only have three.
[450:03.62]More hopping?
[450:04.14]It's because you have the worst weapon.
[450:08.01]Yeah, but I mean, I have spells.
[450:14.89]Change the spell to this?
[450:17.88]Alright, if I don't beat him in the next, like, three or four attempts, I'm literally gonna eat this fucking flail on stream.
[450:24.70]And then I'm gonna get a new weapon.
[450:28.75]I think this- nah, I'm gonna keep the pebble.
[450:31.11]Pebble's better.
[450:33.07]Oh shit, I wasn't paying attention.
[450:38.72]Alright.
[450:39.24]Pay attention.
[450:39.72]Pay attention.
[450:40.00]Pay attention.
[450:40.40]Come on.
[450:40.61]Come on.
[450:40.83]Take it seriously.
[450:41.61]This guy's not that hard.
[450:44.55]He really isn't.
[450:45.67]I just... I'm just... I just can't get his pattern down.
[450:48.85]My brain just cannot do the two speed changes.
[450:51.57]It's making me want to fucking just chug this as fast as I can.
[450:56.46]Charge the spells?
[450:57.06]I don't think I can.
[450:59.46]Charge the spells?
[451:00.38]There's no... There's no charge.
[451:03.08]There's no...
[451:06.43]Except, no, I have played through all these games without summoning anybody.
[451:10.63]With the exception of one or two cases.
[451:12.41]I ain't doing it.
[451:12.81]I'm doing it on my own.
[451:14.25]I'm doing it on my own.
[451:16.27]Yeah, yeah, I can't charge this.
[451:24.46]Hold on, let me start.
[451:26.54]Hold the button down?
[451:28.62]That's what I was just doing.
[451:33.80]How much mana does that use?
[451:40.06]It uses a lot more.
[451:43.16]The boys are terrible.
[451:46.31]I would have literally been in the next area by now.
[451:50.55]If I make another joke at the end of a boss fight, I will gift 50 million subscriptions.
[451:58.59]I will gift 100 trillion subs if I make a joke with one HP left on this guy again.
[452:09.46]That's 100 damage, okay.
[452:35.09]That is a lot of mana.
[452:36.13]I'm not sure I like this.
[452:41.78]I wonder if it's better to actually just try to... Use the... Use the melee weapon, right?
[452:56.97]I swear to God, what the fuck, man?
[452:58.84]Why?
[452:59.16]Am I running out of stamina and I'm not just noticing that?
[453:02.80]That's weird.
[453:03.28]Shouldn't be.
[453:10.56]Because he... I can stagger him.
[453:16.04]You really have to wait to, like, literally press a button to attack him.
[453:36.52]Alright, hold on.
[453:37.14]So let me get this.
[453:39.86]It's not a bad idea.
[453:42.66]It's not a bad idea.
[453:47.00]It's gotta have the build-up, right? ...
[454:22.24]God damn it.
[454:23.02]I have no my heels either.
[454:41.89]I swear to God, something weird is happening.
[454:44.66]I just tried to dodge and it didn't do anything.
[454:47.08]He didn't even move.
[454:48.16]He didn't do anything.
[454:49.14]What the fuck?
[454:51.50]What's going on?
[454:53.02]That makes no fucking sense.
[454:56.82]I had the same problem.
[454:58.67]I am not fucking... This is not copium, I swear to God.
[455:02.65]Like, sometimes he just doesn't dodge.
[455:06.61]What?
[455:06.79]What?
[455:10.95]I mean, I'm plugged in.
[455:11.91]I'm not wireless.
[455:13.31]It's copium.
[455:14.07]I swear to God, it's not copium.
[455:17.48]It's not even input lag.
[455:18.46]It's like, it just doesn't work.
[455:21.88]Like, I'll go dodge, and he'll just, he won't move.
[455:26.38]I had the exact same problem, but it was only with this boss.
[455:28.88]Really?
[455:30.86]Magic has end lag.
[455:34.68]I don't think so.
[455:35.62]I didn't cast a spell.
[455:42.26]That was weird.
[455:47.99]I had a full bar of stamina.
[455:55.41]Alright.
[456:01.60]How many attempts have I had on this boss?
[456:03.24]This is like insane.
[456:06.64]Like this is crazy.
[456:11.22]Have I just been so far out of the game with the Souls games that I'm just so rusty that I can't beat the first boss?
[456:39.92]Alright, let's go.
[457:08.11]I hate it.
[457:08.49]This is the one.
[457:30.30]It happened again.
[457:55.13]What the fuck is happening?
[457:59.86]Thank you.
[458:29.69]Is that a- alright, don't like fuck- no fucking around?
[458:33.19]Is that actually a problem at this guy?
[458:34.85]I swear to god, like, 10% of my inputs are not being done on the dodge.
[458:45.84]It's weird, what the fuck's happening?
[458:56.99]Is it where the terrain is sloped?
[458:58.15]I don't know.
[458:59.03]Sometimes it's just like when he like goes in the air.
[459:02.01]I don't even like attempt to dodge.
[459:04.21]Heavy jump attack.
[459:06.20]Is it a frame issue?
[459:07.64]I mean, it's weird.
[459:09.86]I promise I'm not making it up to make it look like I'm not fucking terrible at this game.
[459:27.40]Just jump backwards.
[459:35.65]I... It's... But you heard it.
[459:37.35]You could fucking hear me click it.
[459:39.09]Twice.
[459:39.97]Twice in a row you heard it.
[459:41.43]I swear to God.
[459:42.15]What the fuck is happening?
[459:43.53]You heard me click.
[459:46.92]What?
[459:47.24]What?
[460:23.25]It's doing it again.
[460:24.09]This is a big problem.
[460:27.81]Now I'm realizing what the fuck's been happening this whole goddamn time.
[460:36.25]My dodges aren't happening.
[460:44.02]Crouching?
[460:44.56]I don't think so.
[460:48.81]Get an on-screen?
[460:49.73]I'm about to fucking sit here and show you.
[460:52.31]Like, it's just that, like that.
[460:56.37]Sometimes he just doesn't do it.
[461:00.30]Need to resupply the copium.
[461:01.80]I'm fucking not fucking around.
[461:07.30]Your V-Syncs is doo-doo?
[461:14.36]You don't have to beat him.
[461:16.12]I mean, that's a huge problem if that's what's actually been happening.
[461:22.65]Because I feel like I shouldn't be getting hit like half the time.
[461:30.91]Is it actually the terrain?
[461:32.13]Like I'm getting stuck on like a cinder block or something?
[461:34.61]But he won't even do the input.
[461:52.60]No... ...passing.
[462:37.90]Get his ass!
[462:38.82]Get his ass!
[463:06.42]Why are there sticks everywhere?! !
[463:18.15]Thank you.
[464:21.89]Look at that fucking muscle!
[464:23.17]It's bigger than anything you've ever seen!
[464:35.99]Guys?
[464:38.03]Guys?
[464:38.51]I can't get up.
[464:43.59]My arms are too weak.
[464:59.37]The dodge is fucked, and I'm not kidding.
[465:04.15]The dodge is fucked.
[465:05.79]The dodge is fucked.
[465:06.59]I'm not kidding.
[465:07.43]I swear to God.
[465:08.15]Alright, okay.
[465:19.44]This input lag caused by forced V-sync.
[465:21.42]Capping your FPS under 60 should fix it.
[465:23.84]Oh, fuck.
[465:25.66]Poof.
[465:30.93]Oh, thanks for the Kofium, man.
[465:32.04]Appreciate it.
[465:42.18]That guy was fucking crazy.
[465:48.71]I swear, that probably wouldn't even have been that bad if that wasn't happening.
[465:54.65]I wouldn't have died, like, 40 times with that guy.
[465:56.63]If I didn't have, like, 10 to 20% of my dodges actually where the input was there.
[466:02.17]You know what I mean?
[466:02.75]Like, that's great.
[466:12.95]Alright, I got a ton of... This game is really good.
[466:16.51]This game is really good.
[466:17.73]Fuck that boss.
[466:18.43]Throw him in the ocean.
[466:20.09]Okay.
[466:21.49]So, this game's good.
[466:22.49]It's very good.
[466:25.37]So.
[466:27.36]Ooh, I got a lot of level up to do.
[466:31.24]You just suck so bad.
[466:32.58]Alright, fine.
[466:34.70]Yeah.
[466:35.38]Oh, you think I just suck so bad?
[466:36.60]I said it.
[466:38.32]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[466:39.10]You can do it too.
[466:50.47]Wait, you said you would what?
[466:52.23]What did I say?
[466:56.34]You wouldn't have died so many times if you didn't try to be a funny e-clown.
[466:59.05]I know.
[467:00.35]Trust me, dude.
[467:02.15]I am internally punishing myself right now for that bullshit.
[467:08.31]Because 10 to 15 more attempts were added because of that.
[467:13.40]This person said, you look like you were having lots of fun back there.
[467:20.70]You said you would eat your flail if you died three times.
[467:23.04]When are you going to eat it?
[467:24.64]Okay, so just make sure everybody knows.
[467:27.46]So I said if I made any more jokes, I'd give 100 million subs.
[467:31.04]But that was just for that boss.
[467:32.61]That was just for that encounter.
[467:34.27]And it's not any other encounter.
[467:36.99]Like, I can make jokes at the other stuff if I want to.
[467:39.79]It was just for that boss.
[467:40.91]I wanted to clarify that.
[467:41.69]Alright, so do I just dump points into Endurance and call it a day?
[467:45.90]Okay.
[467:49.27]And just never do it again.
[467:50.19]Or should I... 20.
[467:51.09]Should we spread it out?
[467:54.85]Maybe some more mana.
[467:55.45]Plus 2 being bad at game.
[467:59.82]Thanks for the content.
[468:04.32]It was the dodge.
[468:05.12]It was the dodge.
[468:05.72]It was the dodge.
[468:06.32]It was the dodge.
[468:06.90]It was the dodge.
[468:08.74]I'm going to say let's get this to 15.
[468:10.70]And then I'll do... That looks good to me.
[468:18.38]That looks good to me.
[468:24.64]How long have I been playing for?
[468:34.73]Eight hours?
[468:35.17]I want to keep playing, though.
[468:38.55]What time is it?
[468:40.39]It's like midnight, but... I'm not done.
[468:48.25]What's the most attempts you ever had on a boss?
[468:50.49]Uh, the last boss in Sekiro took me, I think, six hours.
[468:58.68]It was, I believe, six hours.
[469:08.82]This is beautiful.
[469:09.58]Holy shit.
[469:21.70]Actually, it looks phenomenal.
[469:23.76]Bring some water.
[469:24.40]I got a huge one right here.
[469:25.58]I've been drinking it the whole time.
[469:31.21]I've been watching someone try and beat the Tree Sentinel literally from the moment that you beat it.
[469:36.75]It's fucking not easy, man.
[469:37.95]It really isn't.
[469:40.47]Don't let anybody tell you that these games are like, well, you see, it's fucking simple.
[469:43.31]What you do is you just have to go do this and this and this.
[469:45.58]I beat him on my first try.
[469:47.62]And, by the way, Jerma, like, I beat that guy on my first try, too.
[469:50.28]Jerma, I turned around in my chair and I beat the guy.
[469:53.42]I actually beat him with my fists.
[469:55.02]Like, these games are hard, okay?
[469:57.71]So, if anybody ever tells you that, first of all, say you're full of shit, because they're full of shit.
[470:02.05]And second of all, see one, because that's all that matters.
[470:15.66]What do you want for dinner?
[470:17.50]Um... I don't know.
[470:20.58]Do you have a snack?
[470:24.34]I had a crunchy peanut butter bar.
[470:29.68]Um... I'll take another break in like another... Let me get to like the next section here.
[470:34.67]And then I'll take a break.
[470:38.23]Um... Yeah.
[470:41.85]Give me another few minutes.
[470:46.95]You know, there's probably people that actually can do all this stuff in one, like, without any problem at all.
[470:52.83]But they also get to see the world at, like, you know, 0.5 seconds better than everybody else.
[470:59.39]Like, I told you this theory that I have that we all kind of see the world differently.
[471:02.65]Some people see the world, like, 0.2% like, 0.2 seconds slower than everybody else.
[471:08.14]Some people perceive the world 0.2% faster than everybody else.
[471:12.76]Right?
[471:13.62]People that can play games like this
[471:16.36]I swear to god they have like this 0.0 10 millisecond like slow down that they get to experience like I I just don't understand how it's like that reaction time yeah like the world is is like a little bit you take it in a little bit slower so you can react faster to things it's an alien rant no it's not it's
[471:47.26]Still stuck at the tree, Sentinel.
[471:48.80]Yeah, keep at it.
[471:49.88]But just don't... Okay, here's what happens.
[471:52.04]If you guys are new to playing these games, which maybe some of you are, you just watched me go through about four or five stages of, like, I would say grief.
[472:03.90]It's the weapon.
[472:04.98]This weapon sucks.
[472:06.52]Something's wrong with the weapon.
[472:07.78]Yeah, fuck this weapon.
[472:08.76]This boss sucks.
[472:09.48]This boss is impossible.
[472:10.54]This boss is stupid.
[472:13.24]You know what?
[472:13.58]Maybe I can't do it.
[472:14.84]Maybe I'll just go do something else.
[472:17.46]No, you know what?
[472:18.44]I can do it.
[472:19.20]No, I can't.
[472:20.50]No, fuck this game.
[472:21.12]This game sucks.
[472:21.76]Why do people play this?
[472:23.00]This is the best game I've ever played in my life.
[472:25.52]I want to tell everybody to play this because it's seriously like it's a 10 out of 10.
[472:28.81]Fuck this game.
[472:29.37]I'm refunding it.
[472:29.89]This game sucks.
[472:30.91]Delete it.
[472:31.33]Throw it in the ocean.
[472:33.95]That's literally how everybody plays these games.
[472:38.31]Every single person.
[472:39.41]There's a delay on the webcam?
[472:47.66]It shouldn't be.
[472:53.16]But at the end of the day, if you continue to go for it, and you end up doing it, all the copium, all the anger, all the annoyance, all the frustration, all the, my controller's broken, in quotes, you get this intense feeling afterwards of, that was awesome.
[473:11.97]I accomplished something crazy.
[473:13.39]Because this game's really fucking hard, and it's really, really interesting.
[473:17.61]And then you go back to like, okay, what's next?
[473:20.19]That's why these games are so much fun.
[473:25.46]You're tarnished, aren't you?
[473:29.42]I would advise against taking the main gate into the castle.
[473:35.34]It's tightly guarded by hardened old hands.
[473:40.58]Try the opening right here.
[473:43.40]The guards don't know about it.
[473:46.73]Really?
[473:55.79]I don't know if I trust this dude.
[474:00.69]Use the main gate or sneak around.
[474:02.41]I think I'm just going to the front door.
[474:05.63]What do you think?
[474:16.33]Looks like a trustworthy fellow.
[474:30.11]No.
[474:31.08]I'm using the main gate.
[474:34.62]Well, if you must go through the gates, I'll signal them to open.
[474:40.64]But of course, I'd advise against it.
[474:46.89]No, I'm using the main gate.
[474:49.25]Okay.
[474:49.81]Thank you.
[474:50.11]Idiot.
[474:50.25]Uh, so here's the main gate.
[474:52.69]Open the gate.
[475:17.47]the main gate?
[475:24.34]Hello?
[475:29.86]Open the gates.
[475:35.79]That was much easier than I thought it was going to be.
[475:39.01]Golden rune?
[475:45.25]List of bolt.
[475:46.05]I feel like I should have probably gotten hit by that.
[475:56.02]I thought he was going to let me in.
[476:04.28]I thought he was letting me in.
[476:09.52]I'm jumping on the legend Mario.
[476:15.09]I'm safe.
[476:19.45]He warned you.
[476:20.13]Yeah, but I'm... Okay, I'm here.
[476:23.79]I was supposed to just fall and R1 him.
[476:32.63]I thought this was a different guy.
[476:36.00]That would have been very bad.
[476:41.04]That would have been not good, I don't think.
[476:48.68]Can I not use the horse?
[477:04.97]Can't.
[477:05.35]Okay.
[477:16.43]Somebody hurt him.
[477:17.25]What just happened?
[477:17.91]What the fuck happened?
[477:18.65]Boys!
[477:24.22]Let's go!
[477:32.97]That's the scared sound.
[477:49.59]Watch out!
[477:53.87]Get him, get him, get him, get him!
[477:55.13]Get him!
[477:55.49]Do something!
[477:58.73]Alright, boys.
[478:02.03]Get him!
[478:11.68]We gotta get rid of the ballistas.
[478:13.50]That's important.
[478:15.44]They do just kind of stand here.
[478:16.54]They're all fucking terrible.
[478:19.20]Hey, what's in the telescope?
[478:20.28]What are you looking at?
[478:20.94]Mars?
[478:35.15]Smithing Stone.
[478:35.75]Nice.
[478:35.99]Hey, I need you guys to come up here.
[478:39.61]We gotta go around the sides.
[479:01.48]Anybody see a gamer anywhere?
[479:02.76]I can't find one.
[479:09.43]Up top.
[479:23.94]Really?
[479:31.04]I need to get up here.
[479:32.14]Wait.
[479:34.82]Really?
[479:35.12]Come on.
[479:35.60]I gotta get you from... What happened to you?
[479:55.64]Alright.
[479:58.12]Alright, boys.
[480:01.19]Send them back.
[480:02.51]Wait, they're still alive?
[480:05.85]Oh, shit.
[480:06.25]What happened?
[480:06.75]Did he just die?
[480:08.91]Oh, the final boy just died.
[480:11.77]What happened?
[480:13.11]You don't understand.
[480:14.29]I tried to press B and I got stuck.
[480:16.05]My controller doesn't work.
[480:17.37]This game is fucking horrible.
[480:18.89]This game sucks.
[480:20.27]Fuck this game.
[480:21.47]I should uninstall it.
[480:22.37]I'm going to throw it into the ocean.
[480:25.11]I'll just tell you.
[480:26.09]Relax.
[480:27.25]It gets a little bit funner.
[480:28.71]And you keep going.
[480:30.43]And eventually you're going to beat that boss.
[480:32.10]You're going to beat that guy.
[480:33.66]And it's going to be a lot of fun.
[480:34.58]Trust me, man.
[480:35.50]Trust me.
[480:35.84]It's a really fun game.
[480:36.68]You should keep playing.
[480:42.65]Hunter?
[480:45.56]Alright, so that- the ballistas are all gone.
[480:47.08]I don't think I need to do anything else.
[480:55.18]I think I'm okay.
[481:00.89]This is the anti-game journalist game.
[481:12.78]There's no more ballistas, right?
[481:16.54]Check this out.
[481:18.16]I'm gonna see why you play sorcerers.
[481:25.85]I was thinking I could get them all in one hit.
[481:47.77]Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!
[481:52.39]What is it?
[482:12.28]Has he done the bit of yelling Harry Potter spells when he casts magic yet?
[482:15.31]No.
[482:15.75]And that's a big mistake.
[482:17.35]I'm actually kind of annoyed that I haven't done that yet, so... Where is it?
[482:27.86]Where's the other, um... What is this goddamn thing?
[482:34.10]It fired at me from over here.
[482:36.56]Where is it?
[482:42.90]Where is it?
[482:44.22]I've heard it.
[482:44.76]I'm gonna get hit in the head by a stray arrow and die.
[482:59.45]Looks like a little magic user.
[483:01.13]Doesn't have any more mana.
[483:03.03]Let's see what happens when we get this little bastard.
[483:12.52]Thank you.
[483:35.82]Oh shit!
[483:37.42]Stop being a fucking little weirdo, please.
[483:55.21]I have zero health.
[483:58.50]This is bad.
[484:01.78]Somebody just needs to come over and touch the back of my head and I die.
[484:06.07]I think this is the only enemy that's left in this area.
[484:09.57]So, I can't screw this up.
[484:12.37]I just can't.
[484:18.33]It hurts.
[484:18.77]I got it.
[484:26.82]I'm so overreacting so bad.
[484:29.04]And you all know it.
[484:30.58]But it's so hard not to.
[484:43.93]Is that it?
[484:51.76]I can't get hit once.
[484:52.88]Oh, shit.
[485:03.82]There's a guy there.
[485:04.88]Wait.
[485:11.01]Maybe this way.
[485:19.46]Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man.
[485:22.40]Go back.
[485:23.44]Go back, go back, go back.
[485:24.60]I have so many souls.
[485:39.38]Holy shit.
[485:43.58]Okay.
[485:43.82]It's gonna re- oh wait, it's gonna resurrect everybody.
[486:49.07]Why did he hear me?
[486:59.37]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[487:00.37]I'm just gonna go spend the money.
[487:02.11]I'm gonna go spend the money.
[487:06.37]Oh my god!
[487:06.87]Get in the room, please!
[487:08.39]Get in the room.
[487:08.79]I was kidding around.
[487:09.55]I was messing around.
[487:10.24]Haha, you can't come in here.
[487:14.24]This is a sanctuary.
[487:15.96]Just like in World of Warcraft.
[487:32.02]Come on.
[487:32.62]Come back up here.
[487:33.24]I want you to get stuck in the door.
[487:39.08]Oh, fine.
[487:39.52]Whatever.
[487:41.40]Please.
[487:41.66]Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy.
[487:42.58]This joke.
[487:43.00]This is not a joke.
[487:43.66]I was going to try to get him stuck in the doorway so I could hit him in the head.
[487:49.93]Alright, I'm thinking... Yeah, intelligence.
[487:52.41]No.
[487:53.99]Mind.
[487:55.95]I need mana.
[487:57.93]I need more mana.
[488:04.09]Wait a minute.
[488:05.87]I have kind of a crazy idea.
[488:07.07]What if I pass the time to night time?
[488:13.87]Will they all be in bed?
[488:18.02]Nightfall.
[488:26.19]That makes sense, right?
[488:37.57]Now it's just harder for me to see.
[488:39.55]I'm thinking about killing this guy.
[488:49.36]That's not fourth grade logic.
[488:51.28]That actually makes sense, dude.
[488:57.37]That makes sense.
[488:58.03]Rendo.
[488:58.31]So this is the side entrance.
[489:24.57]Okay.
[489:29.01]Oh, another Smithing Stone.
[489:33.59]I don't make cents.
[489:34.83]I make dollars.
[489:38.13]Time that person out for an hour.
[489:43.04]And then reduce it by 45 minutes.
[489:52.94]Oh, there's another bonfire over there.
[489:55.82]Is that going to hurt me?
[489:59.16]Is there a ladder or something I can climb?
[490:05.18]Hope this doesn't kill me.
[490:13.56]A fucking rare bald eagle!
[490:15.56]Alright, um... Where's the... It's over here.
[490:33.24]I want to keep playing, but it's late.
[490:35.32]It's late, but I want... Whatever.
[490:36.96]I'm having fun.
[490:39.06]I want... Ugh.
[490:46.97]Alright.
[490:49.31]In... I'm coming back tomorrow.
[490:50.95]Keep playing.
[490:55.66]Keep playing.
[490:58.74]I'll take another break, and then maybe I'll eat a little bit.
[491:02.14]Because... I don't know.
[491:04.16]This is awesome.
[491:07.06]It's too fun.
[491:09.62]Pickle ahead.
[491:10.25]Is that the same person that said that they did that in the chat?
[491:14.65]Pickle.
[491:16.77]Is this you?
[491:18.45]This person said they were doing this throughout the game or something, right?
[491:31.97]This summoning pool is now functional.
[491:35.31]Let's head up this way.
[491:36.91]And I'm gonna... Let's get some more... Blasts.
[491:42.00]What do you say?
[491:42.58]Making a nice round 10.
[491:48.44]I don't know.
[491:50.30]We'll see.
[491:52.50]I'm gonna be left tomorrow.
[491:55.33]Essentially, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go sleep and wake up and play the game.
[491:59.13]That's essentially what's gonna happen here.
[492:07.58]Not dealing with that.
[492:17.77]F***ing throw him into the ocean.
[492:44.09]Did he get it off?
[492:47.11]No, he didn't.
[492:47.61]I thought that was me screaming.
[493:06.58]I mean, that's... I do kind of...
[493:13.36]Don't you think about falling off that edge.
[493:15.80]Don't you think about falling off that edge.
[493:17.53]Don't even think about blowing that horn either.
[493:19.11]Where's my spell?
[493:25.01]Oh my god, you idiot.
[493:28.39]You're not even funny.
[493:30.58]I sat there and was like, you're not funny.
[493:32.90]You're not even funny.
[493:33.88]It's like I'm looking in the mirror.
[493:37.34]I'm like psyching myself up.
[493:40.64]You're gonna have a good fucking show today.
[493:42.34]You're gonna be fucking funny.
[493:43.58]No, you're not funny.
[493:44.42]You're not even funny.
[493:45.50]Prove them that you're funny.
[493:46.36]Prove to people that you're funny.
[493:47.26]You're not funny.
[493:48.00]Like, what the fuck was that horse shit?
[493:55.71]It's like a fucking taxi driver.
[493:59.41]Like, what am I doing?
[494:08.53]I can't reach him from here.
[494:21.69]I hear a patter of little footsteps in here.
[494:25.56]I just looked at how weird I looked on face cam.
[494:30.96]Like, that's why I don't ever use it.
[494:44.64]That's not what I was doing.
[494:46.50]Visions of a hidden path.
[494:47.58]There is no hidden path.
[494:50.28]Could this be an item?
[494:51.74]No, it's not.
[494:52.44]Let's go down first.
[495:16.00]I'm not gonna let this guy do that.
[495:22.60]I almost got to fall from the ceiling.
[495:40.17]Hook Claws, what?
[495:41.11]Holy shit, he's ugly.
[495:50.51]Ooh.
[495:59.80]Okay.
[496:04.21]That's actually kind of good, I think.
[496:08.23]Is it weapon art?
[496:08.77]Does it have one?
[496:12.79]Can I do this in two?
[496:13.67]Can I hold my hand and do... Ooh.
[496:16.61]I can.
[496:17.07]It's a dash.
[496:24.86]I think this might be a good idea.
[496:32.39]What's the scaling on it?
[496:33.19]How bad is it?
[496:34.75]Dex C. And it has bleed build up.
[496:38.93]How much is the flail bleed?
[496:42.47]50.
[496:42.53]So it's... Flail does more damage, but it has worse scaling.
[496:45.27]I don't know.
[496:49.53]I'll try it for a little while.
[496:51.11]Wolverine Mage.
[496:55.93]I'll try it for a little bit.
[496:57.35]Why not?
[497:08.24]Nothing else?
[497:25.45]Thanks for clearing the path.
[497:36.27]Very good.
[497:37.00]Very good.
[497:37.52]Very good.
[497:38.24]Okay.
[497:47.94]I have no health potions left.
[497:49.82]That's not good.
[497:55.96]Oh, right.
[497:56.64]Like, Holly was talking about dinner.
[498:00.00]I don't know.
[498:01.14]When I, uh, um, when I go on break, figure out what that's gonna be.
[498:09.73]Something really interesting about this game so far, it's something that seems to be missing from the game that's in every single one of these games, pretty much.
[498:17.79]Besides, I don't remember it being in Sekiro.
[498:19.85]Maybe not.
[498:21.99]It's like shortcuts.
[498:22.79]You don't really need them anymore.
[498:23.73]Because it's an open world game.
[498:26.75]This person's freaking me out so I'm just going to kill him.
[498:32.97]Smoldering butterfly.
[498:34.85]Hit him over there.
[498:58.20]He's gonna have a 2 a.m.
[498:59.42]dinner.
[498:59.66]I don't know.
[499:03.11]This might be one of those weird... Like, my energy is still at, like, a 9.
[499:07.49]I feel fine.
[499:09.03]I feel great.
[499:19.58]I don't feel fatigued at all.
[499:21.50]Like, actually at all.
[499:28.24]I got a lot of these.
[499:32.38]Ah, shit.
[499:37.90]Oh, we gotta go back up.
[499:41.65]You'll feel it tomorrow?
[499:44.65]Yeah!
[499:45.97]But, when was- Okay, since all of the medical bullshit...
[499:49.79]When was the last time that there really was like an 8 plus 9 plus 10 plus hour stream?
[499:54.31]It's been a long time.
[499:56.66]And I mean, if you're only going to get these every so often, then... Why not?
[500:05.08]This is... I'm very invested.
[500:07.21]That's adrenaline speaking.
[500:12.97]I'm alright.
[500:14.95]I'm telling you, I ate a big salad today.
[500:19.45]What the fuck just happened?
[500:23.45]Dude.
[500:31.55]Holy shit, dude.
[500:36.88]I can't lock onto him.
[500:37.88]Why can't I lock onto him?
[500:39.34]I can't lock onto him.
[500:49.54]I thought I could fucking parry him, but I just didn't get it off.
[500:57.20]I thought I could just go wham.
[500:58.54]I thought it looks like I got it.
[501:02.50]I mean... Alright, get back up there.
[501:11.77]That's so far away.
[501:21.01]I can get back up there.
[501:22.43]Now I know that's what's happening.
[501:35.05]Finally, I can take this helmet off.
[501:38.70]You know what?
[501:38.98]I'm going to save my magic because I feel like I'm really going to need it.
[501:50.57]I'm already kind of screwed here.
[501:51.65]Um.
[501:55.60]Um.
[501:56.14]Jeff, where are you?
[502:07.64]Um.
[502:23.66]I gotta get out there.
[502:36.49]I gotta parry that, dude.
[502:37.59]I really- I gotta get in there, parry his ass.
[502:51.45]Alright.
[502:54.10]Give me the shield.
[502:59.97]I'll get it right now.
[503:17.01]I love sorcery so much.
[503:17.95]You can call me cheeseball all you want.
[503:21.51]It's so much fun.
[503:24.03]Although sorcery, like I was saying in the middle of my rage-induced bullshit, sorcery is cool, but there are some bosses in this game and all the other games where you just cannot do it.
[503:36.18]The fact that you need the standing still for that one second is enough to die.
[503:45.31]But it's great for like 85% of the entire rest of the game.
[503:49.09]Which is why this is actually good to do kind of a battle mage.
[503:52.32]Because I'll still be able to use, be able to actually fight things with my hands.
[503:58.99]Alright, let's go.
[504:00.03]Parry.
[504:21.20]Oh, you thought the darkness was your ally.
[504:25.32]But I was for you.
[504:27.42]And you were blinded.
[504:28.42]I don't even know what the lyrics are.
[504:31.08]The lyrics?
[504:36.31]What the fuck am I talking about?
[504:44.81]I did it so good.
[505:01.75]Where is he?
[505:02.17]Come on dude, don't just get stuck in the fucking door.
[505:06.41]Holy shit, he's right there.
[505:11.98]What are you doing?
[505:13.42]Get the fuck out of the way!
[505:23.62]Come on out.
[505:26.52]Oh, you chump.
[505:27.30]Are you really going to do this?
[505:28.32]Alright, fine.
[505:28.80]Jesus ass.
[505:31.57]It won't go through the door.
[505:32.29]Come on.
[505:48.66]Come on.
[505:53.69]I have to run in there.
[506:01.07]One, two, three, go!
[506:01.43]Oh, are you immune to magic?
[506:19.36]You didn't have anything on you?
[506:25.67]A rusty key.
[506:31.35]Okay.
[506:31.81]There's a chest here, too.
[506:39.52]Curved sword talisman.
[506:43.82]Really?
[506:44.90]What does that do?
[506:48.18]I'm safe in here, right?
[506:52.87]I can wear two of these?
[506:53.73]Enhances guard counters?
[506:58.13]I don't really know what that means.
[507:06.05]Guard counters?
[507:07.21]I don't think I've done that once.
[507:13.20]You start holding the attack button to power attack with sorcery.
[507:15.90]Yeah, it doesn't work.
[507:16.50]Yeah, look.
[507:16.98]Holding left bumper.
[507:19.46]You can't charge it.
[507:20.26]Maybe I'll learn that later.
[507:27.12]Okay, cool.
[507:27.72]That's a cool thing to get.
[507:29.30]It's for shields.
[507:34.12]I might actually go back to the bonfire, but maybe not.
[507:36.88]Let's see if I can keep going.
[507:41.70]Can I go through this?
[507:45.00]Okay.
[508:12.68]St.
[508:13.12]Trina's arrow.
[508:16.12]Ooh.
[508:16.40]Is there anything else I can do up here?
[508:22.45]Can I go up there?
[508:26.17]Well, we'll find out.
[508:26.73]I'll come back if I need to.
[508:40.69]Get away from the edge.
[508:41.45]Probably left.
[508:43.54]I... I'm gonna fall off.
[509:17.64]What's down there?
[509:18.10]What's that?
[509:23.40]Have I been there before?
[509:24.60]Yeah.
[509:26.98]L plus ratio.
[509:28.14]You fell off.
[509:36.37]What's the point of that?
[509:45.91]How do I get up there?
[509:59.22]Ooh, that's the key.
[510:01.64]Alright.
[510:05.50]Locked door.
[510:05.86]Yeah, that's cool.
[510:07.74]I thought that was... For some reason, I thought I was going to have to bring that somewhere.
[510:11.68]I wasn't here.
[510:13.22]You need to go to sleep?
[510:16.06]I will very soon.
[510:29.23]I knew it.
[510:31.83]I saw the things on the ground.
[510:33.59]I should have known better.
[510:34.45]I'm in trouble here.
[510:38.60]This is bad.
[510:43.28]Alright, let's just take a look over here.
[511:10.87]Nobody else?
[511:12.23]I'm just going to jump behind the boxes, right?
[511:18.49]Last shard.
[511:20.69]Silver pickled fowl foot.
[511:25.38]Pickle thing.
[511:26.14]Okay, so what's out here?
[511:32.81]Further up or...
[511:49.76]I'm gonna go the other way.
[511:50.44]There's another place to go this way.
[511:55.76]Somebody on the ceiling right?
[512:12.59]I'm so paranoid.
[512:19.57]Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
[512:34.46]That was almost a disaster.
[512:36.66]Okay.
[512:38.65]Fire Grease.
[512:44.95]How do I get that?
[512:53.18]Shit.
[512:53.44]Can I jump up there?
[513:01.92]I don't think so.
[513:04.47]Oh, no way.
[513:05.05]You definitely have to fall in there somehow.
[513:08.45]Do we have a little fall joke as a treat?
[513:12.65]No.
[513:16.78]I can jump from here to there.
[513:18.86]Okay, hold on.
[513:24.55]I definitely can make that.
[513:25.31]Can I?
[513:29.94]Maybe not.
[513:41.84]Yeah, it was a little fall joke.
[513:42.98]It was a little bit.
[513:48.82]You know the EU people up if they... Oh, the EU.
[513:51.91]That's right.
[513:52.43]What time is it?
[513:56.38]It's like 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning EU.
[513:59.87]This is finally an EU stream.
[514:04.41]I just had to sit here for long enough.
[514:09.99]All the NA crowd went to sleep already.
[514:12.65]Which I'm surprised that there's... I mean, it's like 1230.
[514:17.81]This is crazy.
[514:19.37]I'm surprised at the amount of people that are here.
[514:26.29]I'm going up.
[514:27.65]No, I'm not.
[514:28.65]I can make that jump.
[514:29.73]I'll try it one more time.
[514:37.16]EST is waking up.
[514:38.16]EST has probably been asleep for the last two hours.
[514:40.74]I wasn't even looking.
[514:44.74]I wasn't even looking.
[514:45.48]I wasn't even looking.
[514:46.98]I wasn't even looking.
[515:02.26]You better still be alive when I go to sleep.
[515:06.19]I eventually am going to go to bed.
[515:12.67]Okay.
[515:13.77]So let's go here.
[515:18.39]Maybe a running start?
[515:19.05]Or do you think it matters?
[515:19.73]There you go.
[515:33.01]Oh, fuck.
[515:39.14]Stop hitting me with your goddamn shield!
[515:42.96]Dodging is death here, by the way.
[515:44.36]Dodging is death.
[515:45.22]I'm running.
[515:51.47]Okay, that's it!
[515:53.51]Okay.
[516:04.24]Oh, why?
[516:18.67]I just, it was the panic.
[516:20.51]I can get back up there.
[516:21.47]God, that's unfortunate.
[516:24.68]That's unfortunate, but it's okay.
[516:25.80]It's okay.
[516:26.00]We're just gonna speedrun this.
[516:30.33]I'm just going to speedrun it.
[516:31.15]I'm going to run up there and he's going to blow the horn, but he's going to run right by him.
[516:34.07]It doesn't matter.
[516:36.19]Actually, we need to kill this guy.
[516:37.25]I actually don't want him to blow the horn.
[516:45.52]Throw it, please!
[516:56.19]You didn't even blow this shit up!
[517:09.60]That's how I go out.
[517:11.26]Like that.
[517:12.98]After getting all the way through it.
[517:15.30]After going all the way through it, that's how I go out and I lose 2,000 souls.
[517:19.16]That's how it happens.
[517:27.96]We're going for a record here.
[517:41.51]Well, now it doesn't matter.
[517:42.25]So now I'm just going to run up there.
[517:47.10]It does sound like me.
[517:48.00]You're right.
[517:49.24]I can't even fight that.
[517:51.26]There we go.
[517:51.66]That's better.
[518:01.90]Throw another one already.
[518:02.90]Hey.
[518:09.14]You just killed all your friends.
[518:10.52]Fuck.
[518:12.84]Just go, go, go, please.
[518:14.71]I need a pee break.
[518:19.47]Alright, when I get to the top of this tower, we're taking a pee break.
[518:30.49]Holy shit, I forgot about that guy.
[519:09.60]Get out of here.
[519:15.00]Fuck this guy.
[519:15.58]I'm fucking snapping this guy's neck.
[519:21.46]Sorry.
[519:21.97]Had to get my revenge.
[519:22.69]What kind of salad did I have?
[519:30.99]It gave me superpowers.
[519:31.87]I swear to God, I don't understand.
[519:33.79]It was radishes, lettuce, parmesan cheese, croutons...
[519:41.06]Oh no, it was this thing.
[519:44.30]Okay, this actually gave me superpowers.
[519:49.27]This is a peanut butter cliff bar.
[519:52.97]That and a salad apparently gives you unrelenting energy.
[520:00.91]Oh, dude, wait a minute.
[520:03.26]No, what?
[520:04.54]I drank that matcha green tea thing.
[520:09.86]It was the green tea thing, probably, right?
[520:11.53]Well, that worked.
[520:20.91]Was it a chicken parm?
[520:21.99]No, it wasn't chicken parm.
[520:23.48]It was like a... Okay.
[520:24.78]I had a salad?
[520:26.52]Like a masha green tea powder, like, drink.
[520:32.36]It's the guy that just... Okay.
[520:33.16]You're annoying.
[520:34.78]You're annoying.
[520:48.30]It was a salad, the green tea powder, and that cliff bar.
[521:03.80]Okay, I've made it here.
[521:04.88]This is where I died last time.
[521:11.51]Interesting.
[521:20.45]Brick hammer?
[521:21.11]Is that dex?
[521:23.61]Because that's kind of cool.
[521:28.76]Oh, it's strength.
[521:33.96]Now this is the real caveman weapon.
[521:38.34]Yeah.
[521:38.86]It's just like a... It's just like a block of cement with some rebar.
[521:45.60]I... Actually, I think this item is in Dying Light.
[521:47.52]Okay.
[521:59.57]I also got this, too.
[522:01.61]This Lord Sword... Greatsword.
[522:04.25]Greatsword.
[522:07.88]This is a little bit more strength, too.
[522:09.08]It's kind of like a longsword.
[522:11.66]It's really cool.
[522:12.08]It's nice looking.
[522:12.88]It looks cool.
[522:14.50]Cool.
[522:23.71]I'll go with... I'll stick with the claws.
[522:24.83]They're fast.
[522:27.69]Claws are much faster than the flail, so... But that's what was up here.
[522:35.67]So now...
[522:37.75]Where the hell do I go now?
[522:45.49]I can't really go up from here.
[522:50.31]Oh, yeah, I can.
[522:54.35]This is where I was before, though.
[522:57.00]How do I go up?
[523:00.12]From here.
[523:07.58]The stairs you didn't want to... Oh, that's right.
[523:09.82]Okay.
[523:10.36]Yep.
[523:10.70]That makes sense.
[523:23.81]I fell off accidentally.
[523:35.52]I'm on pst and I want to go to bed um yeah but Elden Ring hog champ it's alright I'm gonna be playing this all week so don't worry and I'm not gonna rush through the game
[524:03.03]This is the most focused I've ever seen you in a game ever.
[524:05.81]I mean, the FromSoftware series are some of my favorite games ever, so.
[524:12.25]I love this.
[524:14.55]I love getting angry at games like this.
[524:17.14]I love getting super into it.
[524:19.14]I love finding things.
[524:20.14]I love scavenging.
[524:21.34]I love... And this is like the ultimate version of that because it's open world.
[524:26.10]And I don't even know what direction I'm going.
[524:27.34]I'm just going in one.
[524:37.21]And I will be very honest, because I have to be, it's real close to being at the same caliber of the first, like, five to ten hours of Bloodborne for me.
[525:01.54]And I actually think it might have an edge, just simply because you don't have to go in a certain direction.
[525:07.73]It might have the edge.
[525:09.75]But that first real boss made me want to gouge my eyeballs out.
[525:17.98]Don't move.
[525:18.38]We can't see you.
[525:32.08]Oh man!
[525:44.66]You're slow as shit too, aren't you?
[525:48.25]Holy shit, man.
[525:49.57]You're so slow, but you have weapons like this big on the screen.
[525:55.13]If I only... I probably should have parried him.
[526:00.51]I'm gonna... I know roll into him, but I roll to the left because I just... My brain just goes left.
[526:23.66]Throw it, throw it, throw it.
[526:36.40]Did you dye your eyebrows?
[526:37.41]It's making me feel insane because I can't tell if you did.
[526:40.07]Oh, yeah.
[526:40.77]Here.
[526:43.71]I wiped it all off earlier, but you can see it.
[526:45.47]See it all?
[526:55.63]Oh yeah, I'm supposed to say no I didn't.
[527:01.31]Oops.
[527:04.09]I need some like gamer cushions here.
[527:05.57]Alright, let's try this again.
[527:16.45]I'm gonna go for a parry.
[527:20.91]I think parry is the way to go here.
[527:34.04]That didn't work.
[527:48.94]Can I get him?
[527:49.58]What?
[527:51.42]What are you doing in here?
[527:53.55]Yeah, I know.
[527:54.25]Yeah.
[527:54.87]I'm fucking fighting a guy in Dark Souls 2.
[527:57.09]Yeah.
[528:00.09]Yeah.
[528:01.43]Sorry, bro.
[528:02.43]Sorry, bro.
[528:03.05]Yeah.
[528:13.69]It's alright, bro.
[528:15.19]You're not getting the controller.
[528:18.07]No.
[528:19.63]No, I don't fucking care.
[528:20.77]I don't care.
[528:21.39]I don't care.
[528:22.29]Get off me, man.
[528:24.48]You can't.
[528:24.86]You're not gonna be able to do it.
[528:27.24]No, you're not gonna be able to do it.
[528:31.12]Go buy it.
[528:31.62]You have a PS5.
[528:32.26]Okay.
[528:43.18]Get out of my room.
[528:45.84]Get out of my fucking room.
[529:00.59]Why are you insane?
[529:01.57]I'm not.
[529:04.77]I was going to yell mom, but... I don't know.
[529:08.17]I didn't want to freak out Holly.
[529:12.21]Be like, Mom!
[529:13.73]She'd be like, what the fuck is happening in there?
[529:21.66]Like, that's even that big of a deal?
[529:24.00]Think of all the weird, crazy shit I've been screaming this whole day.
[529:29.06]You!
[529:29.66]Get out of my room, dude!
[529:30.96]Alright, we're going double claw.
[529:35.74]It's the only way.
[529:48.01]Oh, no, it's not.
[529:48.65]This is not the only way.
[529:50.53]This is the way.
[529:54.03]Can he fall down there?
[529:57.97]Oh, this is going to be some fucking Doritos nacho cheese there.
[530:05.68]No, get out of my room!
[530:06.36]Get out of my room!
[530:07.38]Get out of my room!
[530:08.82]Get out of my room!
[530:20.72]Why is he so much faster than me?
[530:22.16]It's not fair!
[530:28.39]Bro, bro, why are you wearing a suit of armor?
[530:31.73]Get out of here!
[530:43.53]He's got so much reach.
[530:44.81]Alright, give me this thing.
[530:53.87]Stop!
[530:55.76]Stop!
[530:56.38]Alright, I got him.
[531:12.64]Where are my souls?
[531:18.82]Here?
[531:19.10]Oh, there they are.
[531:24.88]Wait.
[531:27.38]Wait.
[531:28.04]What?
[531:30.06]That's death.
[531:30.84]Don't be an idiot.
[531:39.55]I only had a lover.
[531:50.66]Did you miss a death?
[531:51.66]Um... I don't... I don't know.
[531:54.68]I don't think I died.
[531:55.74]Did I?
[531:55.98]I feel like somebody's hiding back there.
[532:06.37]Ooh.
[532:06.81]Contraption does not move.
[532:08.03]Come on.
[532:08.55]Really?
[532:16.77]Rawstring Fire Grease?
[532:34.42]um okay well there's up there is this way let's go this way first oh hell yeah thank god but wait I don't want to respawn that guy so let me just take a little look around real quick
[532:57.09]Doesn't move either.
[533:03.30]That's kind of stupid.
[533:04.98]Both of them don't work.
[533:08.72]We get a mechanic in here then.
[533:12.38]Check over here.
[533:18.03]Just in case.
[533:18.63]Something cool.
[533:38.70]I'm not even kidding.
[533:41.38]I'm going and I'm going to go buy like 10 packs of that fucking matcha powder.
[533:48.90]I just kind of had a little bit.
[533:50.84]I feel great.
[533:55.44]It's not like energy drink bullshit.
[533:57.05]It's just like green tea.
[533:58.65]Oh, man.
[533:59.11]I feel good.
[534:19.05]I need to take a look at some armor too.
[534:22.21]Um, can I... Is this stupid?
[534:31.66]This might be stupid.
[534:36.43]I made it.
[534:36.71]That's it.
[534:53.55]That was kind of dangerous, but nothing.
[534:57.42]Oh, never mind.
[535:00.42]Can I walk on that?
[535:04.34]I think I just almost just killed myself there.
[535:21.76]Okay, we're good.
[535:37.30]Alright, I need that bonfire.
[535:39.62]This is going a little bit too far.
[535:42.44]My liking.
[535:43.14]How can you still be in Orlando?
[535:54.47]Nevermind.
[535:55.49]Nevermind.
[536:03.02]We gonna get a break?
[536:03.60]Um...
[536:21.27]Alright, I'm done.
[536:30.13]I'm done.
[536:34.24]That's it.
[536:35.94]I would keep going, but I'll just get up and go right back to it.
[536:40.52]I'm gonna sleep for as much sleep as I need.
[536:42.44]And then I'm gonna get up probably somewhere...
[536:48.45]Ugh, but I want to keep playing.
[536:51.17]Alright, it's for the best.
[536:53.10]But before I go... I'm gonna... I want to look at some stuff.
[537:08.21]That's fine.
[537:11.11]This is light.
[537:15.11]Damage... Okay, this is magic resistance.
[537:25.39]Maybe I should put this on.
[537:30.05]I'll put it on just to look cool.
[537:41.05]Don't look cool.
[537:43.25]Alright.
[537:44.41]How about one more?
[537:45.57]How about one more?
[537:48.56]I'm just going to peek.
[537:51.32]I'm just going to peek out here and see what's going on.
[537:55.13]I'm going to stop in, like, just a little bit.
[537:59.13]But I'm pretty much done.
[538:01.49]I just want to peek and see what's out here.
[538:03.53]I promise.
[538:03.89]I just want to see what's out here.
[538:10.95]This kind of looks better than the Unreal 5 thing that they showed.
[538:26.85]It's unbelievable.
[538:27.71]Okay.
[538:29.73]I just want to take a peek and see what's out here.
[538:31.07]Okay.
[538:37.62]There.
[538:44.46]Alright.
[538:44.64]There's birds that throw grenades.
[538:48.30]Okay.
[538:48.74]Alright.
[538:49.14]Alright.
[538:49.50]Alright.
[538:49.82]Alright.
[538:50.26]It's... Alright.
[538:55.78]Okay.
[538:56.42]Alright.
[538:57.16]That's it.
[538:57.64]What are we at?
[538:58.02]Nine hours?
[538:58.42]We're going to go right back to it.
[539:08.87]Thank you for watching, everybody.
[539:09.81]It's been the first part of Elden Ring.
[539:17.57]I just forgot the name of the game.
[539:22.58]And...
[539:24.53]I will see you tomorrow.
[539:26.91]Very excited.
[539:27.47]I think it's really fun.
[539:29.74]What time tomorrow?
[539:30.62]That really depends on when I go to sleep.
[539:33.96]I need to eat, relax, go to sleep, and wake up and get to it.
[539:40.26]So... I'm going to try to get up in the morning.
[539:49.23]Maybe at like...
[539:54.01]I don't want to start 2 too early, because I... I don't know.
[539:58.73]Somewhere around, like, between 1 and 2 p.m.
[540:02.05]Maybe 3 p.m.
[540:03.81]Just put 4.
[540:04.97]Just put 4.
[540:06.65]No.
[540:07.13]Alright.
[540:08.63]2 p.m.
[540:09.27]tomorrow is when we're going to start.
[540:10.60]2 p.m.
[540:18.88]If I get up really early, then maybe we'll start a little bit earlier.
[540:22.80]But I'm going to try to go for 2 p.m.
[540:27.33]That's not morning.
[540:27.95]Yeah, but I was thinking about streaming at like 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning.
[540:31.71]But that would require me to get to sleep soon.
[540:35.93]Which I might not.
[540:36.81]I might still be up for a little while.
[540:38.79]So I will see you guys tomorrow around 2-ish.
[540:43.54]And we'll keep going.
[540:47.16]I'm not going to play without you.
[540:48.02]Don't worry.
[540:48.32]I promise.

[542:45.84]I'm not going to be seeing it.
[542:47.78]So I don't know how far they are.
