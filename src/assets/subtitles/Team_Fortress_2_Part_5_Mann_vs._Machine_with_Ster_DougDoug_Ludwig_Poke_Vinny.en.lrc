[00:18.41]See, I'm here.
[00:18.93]I turned it on.
[00:20.83]I turned it on.
[00:27.68]Yeah, we were troubleshooting.
[00:29.00]We make sure we get all get in the party and then we could get everything ready and yeah.
[00:34.20]I'm here.
[00:38.45]Hi.
[00:39.11]I'm gonna go.
[00:39.71]I'm gonna leave.
[00:40.51]I'll be right back.
[00:42.35]I forgot to make a coffee.
[00:44.80]Everyone's just starting their streams now.
[00:46.62]We're getting ready.
[00:47.72]Let me go over what's happening today.
[00:50.24]Hi.
[00:50.38]We're going to be playing some Man vs. Machine.
[00:52.96]Team Fortress.
[00:54.47]Something I've been kind of wanting to do for a few months, I feel like.
[00:59.83]At least six or seven weeks.
[01:02.63]We've got a crew...
[01:05.05]this is the crew that we've been kind of communicating for the last month or so about this um sans one person but we have doug doug ludwig poke Ster and Vinny Vinesauce quite the crew and me
[01:27.42]Yeah, should be fun.
[01:28.60]Looking forward to it.
[01:29.85]I have not, I tested this last night, but I have not really gone completely into Man vs. Machine in years.
[01:37.98]It's been at least five years.
[01:40.00]So I'm excited to at least play it.
[01:41.38]Fill out a party, have some fun.
[01:45.58]Yeah.
[01:47.32]Give me one second.
[01:47.90]I'm going to be right back.
[01:48.64]I'm going to make my coffee and I'm going to be the last one that comes back probably.
[01:52.78]So when everyone's making fun of me and calling me all kinds of names, just remember, I'm getting a coffee and you can communicate that.
[01:59.55]Alright, I'll be right back.
[03:44.14]I am back.
[03:44.66]Let's check on everybody else.
[03:50.98]Is anybody here?
[03:52.65]Forgot there's only six guesses.
[03:53.65]Oh, hello.
[03:54.29]Hey.
[03:54.65]Oh, perfect timing.
[03:56.55]How you doing?
[03:57.25]Good.
[03:58.05]What's happening?
[03:58.47]How you doing?
[03:59.49]I'm nervous.
[04:00.91]Don't be.
[04:01.49]We'll be fine.
[04:02.73]I've never played before.
[04:06.20]Okay.
[04:06.44]Hello.
[04:07.40]Let's help Ludwig out.
[04:08.90]Okay.
[04:10.16]What if I'm bad, Jerma?
[04:11.50]You won't be bad.
[04:12.34]I promise.
[04:12.86]What if I get the team killed?
[04:15.78]Well, people are going to do that on purpose to you anyways.
[04:18.91]What?
[04:19.35]It's going to be like a funny ha-ha.
[04:21.03]I'm already stressed out.
[04:22.21]That's not a funny ha-ha for me.
[04:23.25]It's a stressful ha-ha.
[04:26.14]Okay, so the scout, he's the first class.
[04:29.16]He runs really fast.
[04:30.78]He has bonk atomic punch.
[04:32.98]When he drinks it, he becomes invincible.
[04:35.09]Very important to know.
[04:36.87]The soldier.
[04:37.33]Can I ask you a question?
[04:38.45]Yeah.
[04:39.31]Without, because I don't need to know the classes.
[04:41.25]I just want to know what you think I am.
[04:44.09]Just like soak me in.
[04:45.91]Hmm.
[04:49.43]Interesting.
[04:50.77]He's the first member of the DK crew.
[04:52.83]So I would go Lanky Kong.
[04:54.84]Okay.
[04:55.00]Okay.
[04:55.78]Okay.
[04:58.28]I know I'm being helpful right now.
[04:59.62]People are saying pyro.
[05:00.84]People are saying that you're probably a pyro.
[05:04.10]Well, I'm a pyro.
[05:05.90]Or a heavy.
[05:06.72]Heavy weapon guy could be good.
[05:08.14]Why are we talking about this like it's fucking like astrology?
[05:13.14]It feels like a sorting hat, like Harry Potter.
[05:15.96]Like, oh, are you a Virgo?
[05:18.91]Wait, I'm going to do a BuzzFeed quiz.
[05:22.71]really yeah buzzfeed what TF2 character are you alright well let's let's see let's hear it are there more than five questions on that list which there are 14 questions it is quite thorough yeah I'll link the one I'm looking at here um okay I'm gonna go through this I'll tell you what agent I get in a bit I kind of feel like you're kind of a spy too though don't you think
[05:52.42]Mission begins in 30 seconds.
[05:53.98]The first round of a payload map is starting.
[05:56.01]You loaded late and everyone else has picked a team.
[05:58.67]The game is 8v8.
[05:59.61]Which team do you choose?
[06:00.79]These are really detailed questions.
[06:02.83]A lot of answers.
[06:04.31]These questions are also based on TF2 gameplay.
[06:08.11]Also, I don't want to make anybody upset or anything, but while we're hanging out, I've got a few crates to open.
[06:16.28]I'll get an office of crates.
[06:17.98]We're just hanging out.
[06:19.34]We're just hanging out.
[06:20.78]I know why you live in Vegas now.
[06:23.58]Yeah, makes sense.
[06:24.66]Yeah, makes sense.
[06:26.40]OK, so I do need help while we wait for the other three to be ready.
[06:31.58]I have a ton of cases in crates.
[06:33.88]I opened up some before.
[06:35.70]Should I even open these or are these dog shit?
[06:38.68]I don't know.
[06:39.08]I have no idea what's in these.
[06:42.52]Are these stupid?
[06:43.26]Should I not open these?
[06:48.69]Open them.
[06:49.41]Yeah, but which one?
[06:50.21]Because I know that some of the crate series are terrible, right?
[06:55.22]83 is good.
[06:56.04]If you guys have no idea what I'm talking about in the call, TF2 invented the idea of opening boxes for items.
[07:03.87]And the world has been worse ever since.
[07:05.43]It's all their fault.
[07:06.73]But, hey.
[07:08.45]Kind of fun.
[07:09.09]Let's do it.
[07:10.19]Alright, 83?
[07:10.57]Alright, I'm going for it.
[07:14.99]Let's go 83.
[07:19.19]Unusual right now.
[07:21.35]Hey.
[07:24.81]I already have one of these.
[07:25.55]Are we opening boxes?
[07:29.19]Just to kill some time.
[07:30.33]I only have a few.
[07:32.49]Just to kill some time.
[07:33.83]Just fucking throwing some keys in these crates.
[07:38.18]Is it weird that I want the strange flog item?
[07:43.16]I want to open that one.
[07:51.23]Strange flog.
[07:51.73]Come on.
[07:52.01]Oh.
[07:57.15]Holy shit.
[07:58.81]Why do you have evil villain hair?
[08:01.21]I told you I'm trying to be as gross as possible.
[08:03.39]I'm trying to grow my hair up like a long and just be fucking disgusting.
[08:12.71]Just one crate.
[08:13.47]They want me to open crates now.
[08:14.78]I'm not.
[08:15.78]I don't want to.
[08:16.46]Do not.
[08:17.40]Do not.
[08:17.80]There's no.
[08:19.00]Don't.
[08:19.50]It's just.
[08:20.36]Oh, look.
[08:20.98]I mean, it's kind of cool.
[08:23.17]I've got a lot of items, Jerma, but a lot of this is like classic stuff or stuff people gave to me.
[08:27.21]Ludwig doesn't have any items.
[08:28.01]I'm good, I'm good.
[08:30.31]Is that okay?
[08:31.19]Ludwig has literally all the stock items.
[08:33.97]Yeah, it'll be fine.
[08:36.41]He'll get some while we're playing, no?
[08:38.50]That's true.
[08:39.82]Alright, what about this one here?
[08:40.86]This is like spider one.
[08:42.64]I'm going to open this one.
[08:44.96]Yeah, and I was a little... I wanted to make it nice looking.
[08:49.46]I matched it.
[08:52.71]Chad, this is not a great Leno mask.
[08:57.60]That's pretty... Oh, okay.
[08:59.34]That's pretty cool.
[09:01.16]Alright, are we... Am I, like, just wasting time?
[09:03.52]Are we okay?
[09:04.08]Are we, like, just still hanging out?
[09:05.90]Everyone's doing an intro still, I think, Jeremy.
[09:07.78]Alright, I'm just making sure that I'm not, like... Everyone's like, what the fuck is he doing?
[09:11.32]I thought we went to play Man vs. Machine.
[09:12.54]He's opening crates.
[09:15.65]No, they're all doing their own thing.
[09:17.27]Yeah.
[09:25.61]What is that?
[09:28.01]Cabinet man?
[09:29.73]Is it like a little game?
[09:30.49]Do I have to buy keys now?
[09:34.85]God damn it.
[09:35.41]Did I just get a double?
[09:40.52]Wait, what did I just get?
[09:44.94]Oh, it's Halloween only.
[09:46.02]Okay.
[09:47.06]Who is this for?
[09:47.58]Engineer.
[09:50.94]Engineer.
[09:55.73]No, check.
[09:56.27]It's going to be great.
[09:57.03]Give me a minute here.
[09:57.92]Let me buy a couple of keys.
[09:59.44]That's actually fucking awesome.
[10:01.46]I wish I could have this on right now, but I can't.
[10:05.88]Oh, yeah, Vinny, just make sure you don't do that on camera.
[10:09.04]Oh, I know, I know, I know.
[10:11.24]Yeah.
[10:12.62]Don't show them how much you're buying.
[10:14.46]Make it a mystery.
[10:17.70]That's amazing, though.
[10:18.40]I love it.
[10:19.58]Yeah, what's going on?
[10:20.40]We buying cases?
[10:22.22]I just had a few left over while people were doing intros.
[10:27.04]What's a rare case?
[10:29.98]I wish I knew.
[10:30.92]There's like 200 of them at this point.
[10:34.30]I bought the keys.
[10:35.58]It won't let me open the case.
[10:38.39]Did you buy the right keys for the right case?
[10:40.01]Oh, you may have not.
[10:41.23]Oh, fuck.
[10:42.31]You may have bought incorrect keys.
[10:44.23]Oh, no.
[10:46.69]I knew I was going to do something wrong.
[10:49.00]Oopsie.
[10:52.78]Yeah, there's a million different keys.
[10:57.11]Why did they do that, by the way?
[10:58.23]I don't know.
[11:02.24]I wish they didn't.
[11:02.88]They're not even in my inventory, the keys.
[11:05.54]What happened?
[11:07.76]Alright, whatever.
[11:08.86]This is silly.
[11:10.00]This is all silly business.
[11:11.18]Do you have a pending item alert if you bought them from the market and then you would have to accept the alert?
[11:19.01]You might need to restart your game.
[11:20.37]It's possible.
[11:21.33]Also possible.
[11:24.97]Don't want to leave the party.
[11:26.17]Oh, DougDoug just went offline.
[11:28.36]I wonder if he... If you leave the game, you don't leave the party.
[11:31.82]Okay.
[11:32.44]I'll try.
[11:32.78]I'll give it one shot.
[11:33.70]Let's see if I get a good item here.
[11:37.06]Because, you know, my chat is, like, desperate for me to, like, open items now.
[11:47.57]Wait, the summer event's over in 15 minutes.
[11:52.85]Of September?
[11:53.41]Yeah, that's when the event is over.
[11:55.82]Ooh, I like that.
[11:57.90]Do I already have this?
[11:59.78]I think I already have that.
[12:03.22]No, I don't.
[12:03.88]Chat, I got the keys.
[12:04.80]I think.
[12:06.20]I hope these are the right ones.
[12:09.30]Fuck, they're still not the right ones.
[12:12.96]This is just like Twitch streamers.
[12:14.70]They get together for a fun night of games, and then everyone just sits around and gambles for like an hour.
[12:19.83]Like, but not even gambling, like, appropriately.
[12:22.81]Like, I'm failing at gambling.
[12:24.59]And then we all go to bed at 8.
[12:26.01]Can you imagine, like, going to Vegas, going to the blackjack table, and they're like, sorry, you don't have the right key.
[12:30.93]You have to go get the Australian keys from over there.
[12:34.71]Yeah, it's like a bunch of different currencies.
[12:37.01]How many barriers to entry of like, I just want to give you money.
[12:39.35]Yeah, it's like, oh, cool, blackjack.
[12:40.83]Oh, there's five open seats?
[12:42.17]This is fucking perfect.
[12:43.77]Oh, everybody, yeah, yeah, everybody, got your drink?
[12:45.31]Yeah, sit down, let's go.
[12:46.35]He's like, I'm sorry, sir, this is yen.
[12:49.25]Oh, this is the yen table.
[12:52.52]Each seat requires a different key, even though there's five of them.
[12:55.58]No, that seat is for the summer crates.
[12:59.88]You have to be wearing, like, swim trunks to sit here.
[13:03.04]I can open this chat.
[13:04.50]It's a Manco supply crate number 43.
[13:07.66]Dude, that's an old one.
[13:09.06]That actually might be worth something.
[13:10.80]Some of the old ones, the reason the burning captains and stuff are worth so much is because the crates don't drop anymore.
[13:17.05]I got a rare Jerm.
[13:18.27]I got a Berliner's bucket helm.
[13:21.37]Ooh.
[13:21.81]Poke, what do you got?
[13:22.99]Poke, you opening crates?
[13:26.83]This is the stream now.
[13:31.52]Hey, it's actually kind of... Look, here's the thing about this, though.
[13:35.86]Like, technical difficulties.
[13:38.84]We can just open crates until we're ready.
[13:40.99]This is perfect.
[13:42.13]This is actually great.
[13:43.05]Honestly, I think we should just open crates for four hours.
[13:46.01]We should just do a crate opening.
[13:47.83]That's, like, fun for me, too.
[13:49.01]Like, I'm fine with that.
[13:50.67]I had the highest viewership that I've ever had last week when I opened crates.
[13:55.12]By far the least creative and worst stream I've ever done.
[13:57.54]It was peak viewership for a non-collab stream.
[14:01.67]What if I watch you open crates?
[14:04.71]Oh, that's good.
[14:06.11]I think that would do really well.
[14:09.27]If we get the five of us to pour all of our audiences into one crate opening stream, I think that would be a victory.
[14:16.66]We all just sit around one person opening, and we all get a bunch of crates, like 5,000, and we all just sit around just screaming every time one opens.
[14:24.34]I know you're joking, but I would 100% pivot to that right now.
[14:29.44]Well, I'm opening a 2013 crate right now.
[14:31.93]This crate was from 2013, and I got the bald eagle.
[14:37.49]I don't know what that is.
[14:43.18]Now, chat, I can't right-click the crate and get a key because I have the Steam overlay off.
[14:49.40]And then I have to restart the game again.
[14:51.15]But I mean, who are we waiting for?
[14:52.39]Is everyone still, like, what are we doing?
[14:55.39]They're doing their stream intros still?
[14:57.59]I think Doug had some audio problems, so we're just waiting for... Oh, okay.
[15:02.35]Yeah, I had to reset, but I'm all good now, yeah.
[15:05.08]And then, what about Lud?
[15:06.48]Is Lud doing alright?
[15:08.64]Oh, Lud was still doing the BuzzFeed quiz!
[15:13.93]What do you think he's gonna... I think he's gonna get spy.
[15:16.72]Hello, I've gotten my role.
[15:18.04]Oh, okay.
[15:18.58]So, is it... What is it?
[15:20.60]I am a sniper.
[15:22.20]Oh.
[15:22.78]Oh, okay.
[15:24.68]You guys said that like I'm gay and you're a conservative.
[15:27.90]Alright.
[15:28.76]That's good, man.
[15:30.41]Are you proud of me?
[15:31.49]I'm proud of you no matter what you play, Ludwig.
[15:33.87]Thank you, honey.
[15:34.81]I'm just gonna unlock the jar of piss.
[15:37.35]Or mom.
[15:39.39]Well, I said honey, which wouldn't make sense if I was coming out.
[15:44.67]What is wrong with Sniper?
[15:45.55]Be real.
[15:46.39]No, Sniper's great.
[15:47.17]Sniper's amazing.
[15:47.71]Sniper's my favorite class.
[15:49.43]Great class.
[15:50.53]It's tough in Man vs. Machine because we're fighting hordes of robots, and it's better at single target, but it is useful when we're fighting big guys in this mode.
[16:00.18]It's not bad.
[16:00.74]It's just more situational, whereas Demoman is just going to rip ass the whole time.
[16:05.00]What are your classes?
[16:07.66]I bet you guys got some great classes then.
[16:13.55]I think I'm probably... I'm a sniper with piss and a bow and arrow.
[16:18.19]Wait, what is that called?
[16:21.56]It's called sniper.
[16:22.46]Sniper.
[16:23.48]Oh, you're a sniper too?
[16:24.94]I like to play sniper usually.
[16:27.26]I just shoot people with a bow and arrow and I throw piss bottles at them.
[16:30.44]I'm the scout.
[16:31.50]Hey, welcome.
[16:33.52]Okay, Jerma's a scout.
[16:35.20]What's your class, Poke?
[16:38.36]I'll do whatever.
[16:39.96]Maybe Soldier?
[16:40.70]Yeah, but everyone has a class.
[16:43.17]Is this what is your personality or what are you playing?
[16:46.31]Because I think some people are confused.
[16:48.37]What are you playing, I guess, more importantly?
[16:50.61]Okay, we're all playing Sniper.
[16:53.47]Wait, you can do that?
[16:55.68]I'll play Sniper.
[16:57.22]I'll play Sniper.
[16:58.74]I'll play Sniper.
[17:00.04]Is this like the scene in Dead Poets Society?
[17:05.28]I'm the Sniper.
[17:07.11]I'll be sniper too.
[17:08.51]I haven't seen that movie in a while.
[17:10.21]I got a strange equalizer.
[17:11.69]Is that good or bad?
[17:12.61]It's pretty good.
[17:13.99]Oh, you can strange a hat.
[17:16.45]That's weird.
[17:18.57]Alright.
[17:19.01]So here's how it's going to work.
[17:20.89]Thanks for coming, everybody.
[17:23.65]Thanks for having us.
[17:24.98]going to be a fun time.
[17:25.98]We're going to be playing some Man vs. Machine.
[17:27.34]If you've never played it before, it's a PvE mode.
[17:29.50]We're not going to be playing as other players.
[17:30.84]We're going to be working together to fight against robots.
[17:33.98]So as we're talking about our roles and what we're going to be doing here, I think it's probably good just to kind of get us in.
[17:41.80]We don't have to start the round.
[17:43.36]We can just kind of get in and you can kind of move around.
[17:45.84]You can pick different classes and walk around, shoot the wall for all we need to.
[17:51.27]I do want to make it very clear that we are going to be playing on... We had a debate if we were going to do the easy missions or the really hard ones.
[18:01.69]And we've decided we are going to be doing the hard ones.
[18:04.85]So sorry, those of you that may not have much experience.
[18:08.30]It's time to step up.
[18:10.34]Yeah, step up, wussies, right?
[18:13.22]I don't use general language, but if I did, ooh, would I rip you a new one?
[18:19.14]Just give me an unusual right now so I can put it on and just absolutely dunk on these fucking plebs that are in the goddamn call.
[18:24.46]Wait, girls don't have buttholes?
[18:26.97]What?
[18:27.23]No.
[18:27.61]Cue us immediately.
[18:29.15]Cue us right now.
[18:29.89]Uh, wait.
[18:32.29]Okay.
[18:32.83]We're ready?
[18:33.43]Hold up.
[18:33.83]Wait.
[18:33.95]I think we're ready, yeah.
[18:35.05]Hold on.
[18:35.63]Hold on.
[18:36.11]I'm doing it.
[18:36.70]Hold on.
[18:36.96]I'm getting there.
[18:37.40]Hold on.
[18:41.34]Hold on.
[18:42.46]Hold on.
[18:43.00]Yeah.
[18:43.24]Hold on.
[18:44.27]We'll do an advanced one, and we'll just mess around and walk around and take a look at stuff.
[18:50.71]I think I'm going to be the spy.
[18:51.97]I changed my mind.
[18:53.29]I told you.
[18:54.39]I told you he was a spy.
[18:56.33]I have a really good turtleneck for it.
[18:57.91]Yeah, we're going to have a drip contest, too, at the very beginning, so make sure you put on your best outfit.
[19:04.30]Okay.
[19:04.78]We're doing advanced.
[19:07.44]Yes?
[19:08.24]Yes.
[19:08.44]Yes.
[19:09.69]So we're either going to be very happy or very sad about this.
[19:16.01]Chad, I'm going to be Duncan, the big gorilla dude that shoots.
[19:21.02]What's his name?
[19:21.56]Winston?
[19:23.42]Duncan?
[19:25.06]What's his name?
[19:29.10]You mean Winston from Overwatch?
[19:32.25]Oh, I thought it was Duncan.
[19:33.47]Duncan.
[19:34.74]yeah duncan is actually eating right now like dunstan checks in that's what I was thinking of never mind I'm sorry Jerma I've ruined your stream I'm sorry you come on he already gave us performance reviews and told me that jokes were not okay for the stream before we started whoa man up man up man up man up
[19:56.27]Everyone, pull up your bootstraps.
[19:57.96]Okay, so here's how it's going to work.
[19:59.52]What's going to happen is we're going to get into this game.
[20:02.02]I find it hilarious that you guys are taking advice on TF2 from Charma.
[20:07.75]So let's take it from you then.
[20:09.89]Yeah, I would lead me then.
[20:12.33]No.
[20:13.01]Yeah, poke.
[20:13.43]Yeah, poke.
[20:14.21]Yeah, fuck this guy.
[20:15.11]You know what I mean?
[20:15.99]This game's for children.
[20:17.13]You'll figure it out.
[20:18.21]Hey, Vinny.
[20:18.61]Put your shoes on.
[20:19.49]Pull them up.
[20:20.43]Pull up the shoes.
[20:21.45]Am I crazy to say it's the opposite of for children?
[20:23.60]Oh, my God.
[20:24.36]Vinny, don't listen.
[20:25.40]Are we watching this movie or no?
[20:26.84]I'm not listening to anyone.
[20:27.88]I'm listening to my heart.
[20:29.46]Vinny, don't listen to Ster.
[20:30.56]Fuck this guy.
[20:31.38]Ludwig, don't listen to him.
[20:32.46]He thinks he knows TF2.
[20:34.30]I made the TF2 class tutorials back in the day.
[20:37.00]Not him.
[20:40.76]Yeah, we'll see about that.
[20:41.66]I mean, I was playing Team Fortress Classic back in the day.
[20:45.97]So that was how I spent most of my high school years, just saying.
[20:49.01]A little different.
[20:51.61]I was spamming grenades, but I was doing it.
[20:53.65]I was making it happen.
[20:55.09]Okay, so what do we actually want to play as?
[20:57.17]Because I'll do whatever.
[20:59.41]I thought we were all playing sniper.
[21:00.94]We're all going to do sniper?
[21:03.30]We actually do have three snipers, don't we?
[21:06.09]This is not a random pub.
[21:07.65]We're supposed to be strategizing.
[21:09.95]How would you, if you wanted to change the class, change it?
[21:15.35]You would press the comma button?
[21:19.00]Wait, I'm sniper.
[21:19.88]No, this is my role.
[21:20.74]Actually, never mind.
[21:21.40]I lied.
[21:22.52]Are we all just going to be sniper?
[21:24.20]Can we just do it and just laugh for a minute and then go back?
[21:26.84]Look, I did a 30 question quiz.
[21:28.74]It'd be crazy to not follow up on it.
[21:31.28]Yeah, that's true.
[21:32.38]Let me change.
[21:33.32]I don't have the piss.
[21:34.98]Oh, here it is.
[21:38.19]Oh, if you want to change your loadout, it is M. I should make my sniper look cool.
[21:44.96]We have three snipers on the squad?
[21:46.40]Hell yeah.
[21:47.24]I thought that's what we were doing!
[21:48.26]I think we were doing a little goofiness.
[21:50.48]We're getting goofy?
[21:53.51]Alright, so man versus, let's, I know I'm explaining Andy, but listen.
[21:58.67]There is a counter over here.
[22:00.49]You have money.
[22:01.27]We collect money.
[22:02.87]Each wave, we get a certain amount of money.
[22:04.71]You use that money to upgrade your character.
[22:06.73]Be careful because everything you do is permanent.
[22:09.77]It is not, actually.
[22:10.53]That was a lie.
[22:11.47]You can refund all your upgrades in the bottom left.
[22:13.45]I just, I forgot about that.
[22:15.08]So you can refund your upgrades, but these are important.
[22:20.16]And everything in your inventory can be upgraded.
[22:23.36]Including yourself.
[22:24.78]I'm not worried about all this explanation.
[22:26.53]It just lights out for me.
[22:27.93]Honestly, they're gonna walk in a straight line and you're gonna shoot them.
[22:33.65]We're playing machine.
[22:35.21]This is 20-year-old AI.
[22:36.74]They can't be that good.
[22:39.94]You know, I like that.
[22:41.80]I like that.
[22:42.34]I actually like that confidence.
[22:47.75]So we're doing five snipers, huh?
[22:50.17]I guess that's what we're doing.
[22:52.07]Can someone build a dispenser?
[22:53.64]We can't.
[22:54.18]No, no, no.
[22:55.42]Can someone on sniper build a dispenser?
[22:57.76]Someone in my chat said kick the heavy.
[23:02.52]Actually, no, Poke, we could have one heavy.
[23:04.88]That would be actually perfect.
[23:06.68]We could do five medics and one heavy and just see what Poke does.
[23:10.39]You want to just all just heal Poke?
[23:13.77]That's kind of fun.
[23:16.33]I'll do it.
[23:18.50]We have no scout either.
[23:19.40]Alright, let's look.
[23:20.30]Okay, let's get out there.
[23:22.34]Do your upgrades.
[23:24.54]Put me in, coach.
[23:25.48]Put me in.
[23:26.26]And look, at the top, that is the classes that are coming out there.
[23:29.41]Scout is a fast class.
[23:30.95]The first class in the slot number one.
[23:33.07]Can move pretty quickly.
[23:33.95]Has bonk atomic punch.
[23:35.37]I find it strange that people standing in spawn have toggled ready.
[23:39.81]Starting the countdown timer.
[23:41.09]Why?
[23:41.84]Wait, so should I be sniper?
[23:43.24]What's wrong with spawn?
[23:44.72]I'm sniper.
[23:45.24]We have to be out.
[23:46.58]There's a wave event.
[23:47.74]I'm the only person out here.
[23:49.23]I'm the only person here.
[23:50.15]I'll be out here.
[23:52.37]All the bots are coming from one place.
[23:54.17]They come from one direction.
[23:55.09]See the track?
[23:56.13]See these little dollops on the ground?
[23:59.37]This is the path that they take.
[24:01.63]How do you use the canteen?
[24:02.83]Didn't you guys study for this?
[24:05.08]He has four rockets, but that's not always the case because he might have a couple of rocket launchers that have different amounts of ammunition, different amounts of rockets quantities.
[24:15.96]Chat, I give it like 10 seconds before we lose the round and have to reset.
[24:22.30]No, no, no, no, no.
[24:23.26]I got a bow and arrow.
[24:24.78]We're fine.
[24:25.08]We're fine.
[24:25.34]You already got an amazing shot.
[24:27.52]We're fine.
[24:29.10]You're taking all the money, man.
[24:31.04]You're not sharing at all.
[24:32.50]Wait, does it split it?
[24:36.31]Oh, sorry.
[24:37.15]We'll talk later.
[24:38.61]My chest hurts.
[24:41.93]You're taking all the fucking money.
[24:43.99]I can't see through us because we're all snipers.
[24:46.35]They've been pissed.
[24:48.71]Why did I pick the classic?
[24:49.89]This is like the worst item for Man vs. Machine.
[24:53.21]Not having a teleporter is awful, by the way.
[24:57.49]Yeah, well, maybe you should have played Engineer.
[24:59.97]Should have.
[25:05.27]Oh, I definitely would not recommend Bow and Arrow for this game mode.
[25:09.01]Hell no.
[25:12.42]Wait, they shoot back?
[25:13.68]Yep.
[25:14.64]They do shoot back.
[25:15.84]Certainly can.
[25:17.48]They do exist.
[25:19.28]Somebody build!
[25:20.06]Guys, they're getting real close to our base and whatnot.
[25:26.27]It's okay.
[25:26.81]I got arrows.
[25:27.49]A barrage of arrows in back.
[25:30.34]And here, jars of piss as well.
[25:31.26]Oh, they're behind us.
[25:36.74]Oh!
[25:38.02]Oh, you ammo.
[25:39.48]Ammo?
[25:39.62]Yeah, we don't have any ammo.
[25:40.80]Where's our engineer?
[25:41.56]I think we're gonna be alright.
[25:44.57]I am shocked we've lived this long.
[25:45.95]I'm gonna be honest.
[25:48.63]Oh, doing work.
[25:50.05]I saw that.
[25:53.01]Alright, by the way, if they get the bomb in, we lose.
[25:55.35]What happens if you die?
[25:56.36]Oh, that's what happens.
[25:57.16]You come back, but yeah, it's a cooldown.
[25:59.02]Yeah, he's getting the bomb.
[26:05.14]Oh, Lord.
[26:08.42]Did we survive?
[26:10.69]Yeah.
[26:12.21]Alright, let's wait with this $14 we're missing.
[26:14.61]If we don't get all the money, we don't get a bonus.
[26:17.44]Alright, are we playing on, like, baby easy mode or something?
[26:19.98]Oh, there's more.
[26:20.92]There's more.
[26:21.34]There's soldiers.
[26:22.62]It's wave one out of seven.
[26:24.80]Uh-oh.
[26:25.59]Poker just flew out of my... That's going to be... Somebody's going to get a clip of that.
[26:28.25]Poker just flew out of my nose.
[26:29.27]They're at the bomb.
[26:30.09]They went down the left.
[26:30.85]They went down the left.
[26:31.59]They're at that thing.
[26:32.25]We're losing wave one.
[26:32.99]I'm coming.
[26:33.33]I'm coming.
[26:33.71]I'm coming.
[26:34.15]I'm coming.
[26:34.53]I'm coming.
[26:39.04]Get him.
[26:39.36]We're going to lose.
[26:41.12]We lost.
[26:41.44]We lost.
[26:41.70]We lost.
[26:41.96]Sorry.
[26:42.16]We lost.
[26:42.74]No, we didn't.
[26:43.08]We're good.
[26:43.34]We're good.
[26:44.30]No, we didn't.
[26:45.75]Not yet, Jerm!
[26:46.71]Not yet, buddy!
[26:47.43]I'm shooting as many as I can!
[26:50.85]Get the scout, get scout, get scout!
[26:52.43]Okay!
[26:54.01]Not yet, buddy!
[26:55.93]We lost $14, and I am fucking mad about it!
[27:00.26]Clutch or kick, we're not going to get the achievement.
[27:03.28]I know.
[27:03.92]Oh, we need an explosive headshot, that sounds good.
[27:06.46]Yeah, 100% get that.
[27:08.26]I need to be able to hit a headshot, because I don't think it's happened once.
[27:12.56]It is one.
[27:15.51]That's a headshot.
[27:17.23]Oh, I died.
[27:18.79]Oh, no.
[27:22.82]Bunch of heavies incoming.
[27:24.88]Shoot them.
[27:25.52]What the heck?
[27:26.04]I'm shooting them.
[27:28.62]I don't shoot fast enough is the problem.
[27:31.18]That's right.
[27:31.52]It has to be fully charged.
[27:32.34]This is the worst weapon in the game.
[27:34.58]How the hell did we survive?
[27:36.28]Good job, everybody.
[27:37.64]We did it.
[27:38.27]Wage against the machine.
[27:40.81]That's a good one.
[27:42.01]I get it.
[27:43.38]Can you change classes midway through or no?
[27:46.00]Yes, you can.
[27:47.56]Do we want to take this seriously now or are we good to just snipe?
[27:53.38]I'm taking it pretty serious.
[27:54.64]Are we taking it serious now?
[27:56.92]I don't want to tell y'all, I've been sweating.
[27:59.52]Yeah, let's take it seriously.
[28:00.64]If we're going to take it seriously, then somebody needs to be Engineer.
[28:06.27]I could be Medic.
[28:07.27]Medic works for me.
[28:10.25]Man, I really...
[28:15.07]I'm not sure I'm good with a lot of classes anymore.
[28:17.31]Make sure you refund.
[28:18.13]Are we actually swapping now?
[28:19.71]Yeah, refund before you swap though.
[28:21.43]Refund before you swap.
[28:23.55]So you get the money.
[28:24.17]Vinny, stay sniper.
[28:25.29]You're a good sniper.
[28:27.69]If there's double sniper, I won't be a sniper.
[28:29.72]Someone said you can charge a sniper.
[28:32.62]What does that mean?
[28:34.18]The longer you stay scope, the more damage it does.
[28:36.64]Really?
[28:37.54]Yeah.
[28:38.08]Like Widowmaker.
[28:39.89]Just like Widowmaker.
[28:40.79]Oh, okay.
[28:42.26]Yeah.
[28:43.12]I mean, I was a Widowmaker main, so it should be not too dissimilar.
[28:45.76]Yeah, if you played Overwatch, then you know every single thing that's in this game.
[28:48.54]Oh, okay.
[28:48.98]You know everything about this game.
[28:50.94]Oh, great.
[28:53.46]Alright, Kris Krieg.
[28:54.28]I think Kris Krieg is probably the one.
[29:01.37]Um... Would you prefer Sniper if you want?
[29:04.85]I could swap off.
[29:05.89]You know, I could do Spy if you prefer some.
[29:08.91]I'm good with demo, man.
[29:10.23]You guys, all jokes aside, you can play whatever you want.
[29:13.85]What does that have to do with fun?
[29:15.31]Rotate out as well.
[29:16.65]What the hell is going on?
[29:17.95]Wait, what is that?
[29:19.03]Who did that?
[29:20.43]Is he being weird?
[29:22.10]I'll kick him right now.
[29:22.60]Was that real?
[29:22.98]He switched off sniper.
[29:25.86]Oh, yeah, elbow kick.
[29:27.80]No, don't.
[29:28.28]I actually will get booted from the game.
[29:29.56]Don't do that.
[29:32.41]This will like ruin everything.
[29:38.60]Don't do that.
[29:39.28]Alright, who wants the crits?
[29:42.48]And if you want to know what the crits are.
[29:44.86]The me.
[29:46.34]Ghost stock sniper with explosive headshots.
[29:49.16]The seventh class in the game is the medic.
[29:51.65]Wait, that's what I am doing.
[29:52.87]Is that dumb?
[29:53.83]No, that's good.
[29:54.35]That's good.
[29:54.69]That's what my chat's saying.
[29:55.53]That's a good thing.
[29:59.65]Alright, I'm not doing it to you.
[30:01.27]Ooh, alright.
[30:01.99]Vinny, Poke.
[30:03.05]What?
[30:03.17]Alright.
[30:04.83]We're all on the roof.
[30:05.53]We're all on the roof.
[30:06.83]I'm up here.
[30:07.81]Yeah.
[30:07.97]If you look at Jerma's stream, he got the slick back here looking like he's trying to slap him.
[30:11.79]Are we doing a drip contest or no?
[30:14.27]Oh, that's right.
[30:15.05]Yeah, we'll do a drip contest after this.
[30:16.27]Alright, tank is in this tank.
[30:18.04]We're doing it right now.
[30:19.98]Stock grenade launcher is better.
[30:23.10]Use Scottish Resistance.
[30:24.16]Oh, man.
[30:24.58]I'm getting so many suggestions.
[30:25.90]Okay.
[30:26.56]Poke, when you're ready, just unload on that thing.
[30:28.58]I'm going to give you crits.
[30:31.43]Now.
[30:33.91]I forgot this even existed.
[30:40.72]Guys, my game is really loud.
[30:44.04]Turn it down.
[30:44.90]Ding.
[30:46.64]I'm getting it.
[30:50.83]Watch out.
[30:51.55]By the way, there are spies now.
[30:52.75]So if you see somebody that looks like you, it's not you.
[30:55.85]If you see something, say something.
[30:57.75]Is that not me?
[30:59.05]That's not you.
[30:59.55]I thought that was me.
[31:00.68]Okay, I'm going to shoot the bomb.
[31:02.06]You guys keep shooting the car.
[31:03.70]Yeah, priority is the car.
[31:05.04]The car needs to be shot.
[31:06.58]Drop this right here.
[31:09.32]Not me.
[31:12.80]Oh, by the way, if you need help, press E so I can see.
[31:16.92]Oh, that is a lot of soldiers.
[31:19.31]I got you, Poke.
[31:19.85]They can't be headshot.
[31:21.29]I'm in trouble.
[31:23.17]I'll stay on the tank.
[31:24.63]Yeah, me and Poke should be able to get a tank if I do another of these.
[31:28.09]Alright, I'll try to take the soldiers with the sentry.
[31:32.00]Where's the ammo room?
[31:32.60]Oh, it's down here.
[31:34.36]Uh, there's still spies?
[31:34.88]No, we're done with spies.
[31:37.12]Uh, yes, it's over... It's to the right, basically.
[31:41.54]The right pathway.
[31:44.96]I'm not liking where this tank is at, fellas.
[31:46.99]Tank is almost there.
[31:48.03]I will move my sentry towards it.
[31:49.67]It's going to run me over.
[31:51.73]Oh, yeah, it can run you over.
[31:52.91]It actually can kill you instantly.
[31:56.86]Guys, it's getting close.
[31:57.60]Uh-oh.
[31:58.22]The tank, guys.
[31:59.40]The tank.
[31:59.80]The tank.
[32:04.36]It's gonna get in.
[32:05.12]It's gonna get in.
[32:05.96]All eyes on tank.
[32:07.40]All DPS.
[32:08.40]All DPS on tank.
[32:09.98]All DPS.
[32:10.74]I'm trying.
[32:12.06]I can't do it fast enough, buddy.
[32:13.40]I can't do it fast enough.
[32:14.50]We actually might get it.
[32:15.40]We got it.
[32:15.74]We got it.
[32:16.12]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[32:17.41]Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
[32:18.45]Oh, we're dead.
[32:18.79]It's over.
[32:20.71]No, no, we can do this.
[32:21.33]Gang, we thought we saved it for a minute.
[32:24.61]Okay, we're good.
[32:25.11]Alright, I gotta stop saying it's over.
[32:28.70]I'm died.
[32:29.08]I'm coming.
[32:31.34]You can press H to respawn instantly.
[32:33.60]It costs money.
[32:35.32]But I can revive you.
[32:36.26]I can revive you if I get it on you.
[32:37.90]No!
[32:38.04]I missed a shot!
[32:39.10]Oh.
[32:39.58]Sorry.
[32:40.33]It's okay.
[32:41.55]Alright.
[32:42.03]We needed more snipers.
[32:42.91]Yeah.
[32:43.61]We needed more snipers.
[32:45.17]It was way easier when we were all sniper.
[32:48.73]Who's restarting?
[32:49.27]What's going on?
[32:50.65]Wait, are we not restarting?
[32:52.26]We are, right?
[32:54.22]No, we're good.
[32:55.78]Essentially, we just go back to where we were at the beginning of that round.
[33:00.00]It's not like, oh, we lost.
[33:00.98]We've got to re-queue.
[33:01.60]Yeah, you get your money back and you get to try again.
[33:03.42]That's cool.
[33:10.97]Just pick Pyro.
[33:13.27]I'll try Pyro.
[33:13.87]What's a special key?
[33:18.32]I'm switching.
[33:18.98]I'm not sniper, dude.
[33:22.98]I'm a spy.
[33:24.16]I might go pyro.
[33:25.20]Should I just go flog pyro?
[33:26.56]Just say who cares?
[33:28.90]I mean, flog pyro would wreck the tank.
[33:31.71]Vinny, do you have the flog?
[33:33.45]Sure, I would.
[33:33.97]Let me check.
[33:34.51]Because I can always switch out of pyro.
[33:36.37]I don't have the flog.
[33:37.77]Why don't you do pyro and I'll continue with demo, but with better weapon.
[33:43.33]Okay.
[33:45.60]Yeah, let me refund and I'll go.
[33:47.40]What should I use for my upgrades as a spy?
[33:52.90]So your Sapper... The Sapper is incredible in Man vs Machine because the Sapper disables the robots.
[34:02.17]When you have enough upgrades in it, you can do a huge AOE and turn... They go and they power down for like 5 to 10 straight seconds.
[34:09.99]A huge group of them.
[34:10.83]So it's really, really good.
[34:11.83]Why'd you want me to put the pen on, Chad?
[34:14.19]Sapper power copy.
[34:16.33]Blood, do you know how backstabs work in the game?
[34:19.33]You stab in the back and they die instantly, yeah?
[34:21.21]Yeah, yeah.
[34:21.91]So if you can get behind them, then that will do a lot.
[34:25.40]I'll just increase my jump height and then I'll be able to jump over them.
[34:28.68]This is really fun.
[34:29.42]I actually like this a lot.
[34:30.24]I do have a big problem, though.
[34:31.40]Unfortunately, I might not be able to play Flog because I'm not high.
[34:35.25]I thought you were going to say, I have to go, even though you organized this.
[34:40.35]I'll have to take a five-minute break if I want to do this.
[34:43.53]This is my last round, guys.
[34:44.85]Oh, this is it.
[34:45.73]It was fun.
[34:48.46]If we lose this, I'm out.
[34:51.60]How do I use sappers and cloaks?
[34:54.18]Right-click to cloak, sapper, you have to pull it out, and then you just left-click to put it on a thing.
[35:00.03]Any trick if Sniper still has four to pull out the sapper?
[35:04.71]Or two?
[35:06.53]This is fun.
[35:08.25]I like this a lot.
[35:09.77]Does this require a coupon?
[35:11.42]I'm a spy right now.
[35:12.34]It requires one $1 coupon.
[35:16.65]Also, I was reminded, queuing for us, there's a squad surplus where, like, one ticket pays for everybody.
[35:21.17]Oh, shit.
[35:21.79]That we probably should have done.
[35:23.15]Wait, no, no, no.
[35:24.27]Squad surplus, all that does is just makes us get more items in the end.
[35:27.59]Oh.
[35:28.23]Never mind.
[35:28.57]Yeah, everybody has to still buy it.
[35:31.34]Everyone ready?
[35:32.62]F4?
[35:33.14]Oh, yeah.
[35:33.50]Sorry about that.
[35:34.14]This time, I'm ready to rock and roll.
[35:36.26]Flog Pyro.
[35:37.18]I accidentally taunted.
[35:38.66]Nobody stands a chance.
[35:39.62]With the Gas Passer?
[35:41.80]This thing is amazing in Manverse Machine, by the way.
[35:44.96]This guy's been looking up the strats.
[35:46.66]No, we've been talking about playing this for like two months.
[35:52.50]Wait, really?
[35:53.44]Man, I would have prepared a little bit better.
[35:55.83]The knife does not work on the tank.
[35:57.29]Heads up.
[35:59.77]You can shoot it with your gun because there's no guys coming yet.
[36:03.93]Can I get a better headshot sound?
[36:05.33]Because my... Just dings.
[36:09.31]I got one of me going spin.
[36:11.71]That's the one that most... No.
[36:14.50]I'll get that to you.
[36:15.10]I'll send you that wave.
[36:15.86]Don't worry.
[36:16.18]I need ammo.
[36:16.56]I'm going to get face tapped.
[36:21.59]Did you get spied by a spy as a spy?
[36:24.19]Yes, I did.
[36:26.79]I didn't know that was a thing.
[36:27.85]Oh, we're doing way better now with this composition.
[36:33.03]This is really... Wait, you do more damage the closer you are?
[36:38.76]Yes, proximity does matter.
[36:39.94]Right?
[36:47.90]Going in for the kill.
[36:50.33]The bomb's going right.
[36:52.55]I need help with the tank.
[36:55.21]Yeah, I bet you do.
[36:56.83]Yeah, I do.
[36:57.29]That's why I said it.
[36:58.11]My sentry will get it.
[36:58.97]You guys can go back to the robots.
[37:00.52]Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[37:01.30]That's right.
[37:02.56]I'm going to get the bomb carriers.
[37:06.62]I died.
[37:06.98]Uh-oh.
[37:07.56]Alright.
[37:10.44]Bomb's over here.
[37:10.96]Wait, there's a lot of money on the ground.
[37:13.33]We got to get this.
[37:16.48]Oh, they got me.
[37:18.04]Oh, shit, there's people.
[37:19.52]I'm collecting money.
[37:20.60]I'm trying, chat.
[37:21.31]I'm trying.
[37:21.77]Uh-oh.
[37:25.37]We got lots of snipers and spies by spawn.
[37:27.57]Shit, I tried to jump over it.
[37:30.89]Oh, never mind.
[37:31.47]They're dead.
[37:32.97]I think we're... Watch out for spies.
[37:34.25]Spy is me.
[37:34.86]Spy is me.
[37:35.64]Watch out.
[37:36.00]Turn around.
[37:37.60]That's a spy.
[37:41.95]Save the sentry!
[37:43.29]Working on it.
[37:43.99]Working on it.
[37:44.49]We're okay.
[37:45.13]We're doing fine.
[37:45.63]We're doing good.
[37:46.19]Not bad.
[37:48.23]And chat, I have not played much man versus man.
[37:50.72]This is like man versus machine.
[37:52.16]What are we doing?
[37:53.76]Ludwig, do you know you can disguise?
[37:59.64]You can... So they don't shoot you when you're disguised.
[38:04.02]You don't have to be invisible.
[38:06.20]I love this.
[38:06.90]I found out that they don't... I can't hit them when I'm disguised.
[38:11.73]Yeah, but they won't shoot you and you can just walk up to them and sap them.
[38:15.13]Hey, we're good.
[38:16.13]Oh, you can sap while invisible?
[38:18.59]Yeah.
[38:19.51]No, while disguised.
[38:20.91]That's what I meant.
[38:21.84]Wait, what's the difference between disguised and invisible?
[38:24.30]Invisible is they can't, no one can see.
[38:26.86]It's basically in man versus machine, disguised is better than being invisible.
[38:32.72]Coffee, anybody?
[38:33.20]You want some?
[38:34.76]Here, you want a sip?
[38:35.96]You want a sip?
[38:37.04]Which would be pressing four, I think.
[38:42.20]Yeah, I think I'll get more penetration.
[38:46.95]It's what we're all trying to do in life, isn't it?
[38:50.01]That's right.
[38:51.77]Alright, now this thing is powered up.
[38:54.07]It's gonna be awesome.
[39:00.11]Alright, so we have, if it's, you see the red background, that means that it is guaranteed crits every single shot.
[39:06.70]Uh, and it's, uh, the infinite symbol means that they have infinite ammo and they just spam.
[39:12.36]And there's 128 scouts?
[39:14.28]We're fucked.
[39:16.42]Just shoot them.
[39:20.30]Wait, chat, should I do all sticky upgrades?
[39:23.38]What, what do you guys think in here?
[39:24.70]Is, is sticky bomb is good for, uh, demo for this mode?
[39:29.80]It's been a long time, but you can have a ton of stickies out, right?
[39:33.77]Stickies are good for slow targets.
[39:37.35]Yeah.
[39:38.96]It just does so much damage versus tanks.
[39:40.80]If you, if a tank is coming out and you get crits, uh, you get a crits canteen, and you just put out an entire, just, magazine of, I don't even know what it's called, whatever, people are gonna make fun of me, I don't give a shit.
[39:52.19]Uh, you put, you just do the whole clip out, and you'll do thousands of damage to the tank.
[39:56.79]Okay.
[39:57.27]Yeah, I'm gonna try that.
[39:58.05]I'm gonna see what that's like.
[40:00.14]Find a button for canteen.
[40:01.60]What, what does, what does a canteen do?
[40:04.10]So the canteen at the last tab in the shop allows you to buy personal little power-ups for yourself.
[40:11.18]One of them is invincibility, which is ubercharge.
[40:13.43]So you become invincible for five seconds.
[40:15.79]The other one is crits, which is obviously you get times three damage.
[40:20.11]Is that how much it is?
[40:20.79]I don't know.
[40:21.11]I don't give a shit.
[40:22.49]And then the other one is... Wow, he really doesn't care.
[40:27.35]We don't have to get technical with it.
[40:29.20]I don't give a shit about fucking losers in my chat correcting me.
[40:45.32]you guys are doing a really good job here I'm just waiting to come in I'm waiting for them to get closer and then I'll detonate oh what it's a Jerma adhd special interest stream it was invisible I thought I played that well like a head hitbox like a lobbyist is like paying me to do this what does that even mean
[41:08.54]Alright, we have a lot of money we need to get.
[41:10.05]Big TF, too.
[41:13.19]They're moving on the left.
[41:18.71]With the bomb.
[41:19.81]I got it.
[41:21.03]No, not your... My left.
[41:22.57]I got him.
[41:22.91]I got him.
[41:23.47]I'm over here.
[41:23.81]No, my left.
[41:24.23]Your left.
[41:25.28]I just took care of it.
[41:26.16]Are they dead?
[41:26.54]Yeah, I took care of it.
[41:27.66]He's making fun of me.
[41:28.40]Yeah, we got a bomb down over here.
[41:30.02]I'm freaking out with my sentry here.
[41:31.40]Alright, big soldier.
[41:32.68]Big soldier.
[41:33.12]Nice.
[41:37.78]Nice.
[41:42.88]I'm trying not to whip the stickies, chat, which is a really specific and weird sentence, but you get it.
[41:50.07]Get a whip.
[41:50.63]Alright, sentry buster.
[41:51.95]New mechanic.
[41:52.63]What is this?
[41:53.13]I don't understand.
[41:53.97]I just taunted.
[41:55.13]That helps.
[41:58.35]Whoa.
[42:03.20]Oh, center's down.
[42:04.92]Watch out.
[42:05.32]It kills us.
[42:08.36]What is...
[42:09.82]You got sentry busted.
[42:10.70]Did you guys all know about this?
[42:12.90]We were talking about it.
[42:14.90]It was a very... Oh, my thing is so loud, my headshots are like... Oh, yeah, you're... Guys, the bomb is at the thing.
[42:22.56]The bomb is at the thing?
[42:23.58]I'm whiffing, chat, I'm whiffing.
[42:26.55]Okay, it's good.
[42:27.11]Oh, shit, bomb is at the thing.
[42:29.43]I'll drop the sentry over there.
[42:31.95]It deployed the bomb.
[42:33.03]I couldn't do it as a demo.
[42:33.99]I'm a useless demo.
[42:34.51]Oh, I didn't see him.
[42:37.21]We're good.
[42:37.97]We're okay.
[42:38.31]We got further that time.
[42:39.33]I don't even want to see that from your point of view.
[42:45.12]I let him go by me.
[42:47.64]I'm so sorry.
[42:48.42]I don't want to be around anymore.
[42:50.51]No, it's alright.
[42:51.15]We're doing fine.
[42:51.93]This is advanced.
[42:53.11]This is hard.
[42:55.17]You guys are doing great.
[42:57.12]I'm switching.
[42:57.64]I'm not the spy anymore.
[42:59.06]Make sure you refund.
[43:00.44]If you refund, you get all the money back?
[43:02.02]Yep.
[43:02.42]But you have to do it before you switch classes.
[43:04.87]You have to do it before, right?
[43:06.19]If you did it after, you'd be screwed.
[43:08.81]You might have to just switch back and refund.
[43:10.39]Yeah, you just swap back and then you go to the thing and refund.
[43:14.49]I will be...
[43:17.60]Who's this dude?
[43:18.70]Honestly soldier gun soldier heavy I mean, they just they just do so much pot.
[43:25.58]They have so much power.
[43:26.74]This guy seems cool Demoman.
[43:29.20]Oh is someone already Demoman?
[43:30.64]Yeah, we have one.
[43:31.46]I'm gonna try the more than one demo I can be we have that poke is that?
[43:37.85]Hey engine.
[43:38.37]I'm going soldier You go you go heavy.
[43:40.97]Uh, well, you might like it.
[43:42.37]Oh
[43:43.13]You want less reload speed?
[43:44.56]Hey, Engineer, come over here.
[43:46.04]I really should stay on Medic.
[43:47.64]Where?
[43:50.26]Or Scout.
[43:53.32]Is this where I should set up?
[43:54.20]Over here?
[43:54.50]Sentry goes here.
[43:55.91]Okay, I'll do that.
[44:01.23]I learned my lesson a long time ago.
[44:03.01]Never believe.
[44:04.17]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[44:05.61]Oh, they're talking about channel points.
[44:06.96]I get it.
[44:07.22]Yeah.
[44:12.28]Gotta move that gear up.
[44:19.59]Ideally, at the corner.
[44:22.33]Wait, like here?
[44:23.59]Yeah, so that you can hide behind the wall and still repair it.
[44:26.29]Oh, I thought I would get hit from here, but yeah, I guess you're right.
[44:28.71]Or at this corner, so you still have the dispenser and the ammo.
[44:34.12]We could always just do six engineers and say who cares and just go for it.
[44:37.02]That'd be kind of fun.
[44:46.95]Do you know what?
[44:47.51]I care.
[44:48.68]Ready up.
[44:50.10]Are we good to go?
[44:51.96]Yeah.
[44:52.92]I'm ready!
[44:53.68]Oop.
[44:54.96]Yeah, I'm ready.
[44:55.68]Almost.
[44:56.04]I'm putting on these things.
[44:59.84]Chad, do not question my sticky placement.
[45:03.13]It's great.
[45:05.11]So the question is... Mini gun.
[45:07.41]Oh, cool.
[45:07.75]Why couldn't Overwatch just do this?
[45:09.27]Well, they got Duncan in Overwatch.
[45:14.56]Yeah, why couldn't they have Duncan do this in Overwatch?
[45:18.66]Duncan, Idaho.
[45:19.20]I don't feel like I'm hitting them.
[45:27.70]Oh, right when they land, they're invincible for like a half a second.
[45:34.83]Damn, this pyro up front is doing really well.
[45:38.61]Yep.
[45:41.09]Pick up that money.
[45:42.03]I'm trying.
[45:42.59]Soldier on left.
[45:43.35]Big soldier on left.
[45:44.35]Big soldier got me.
[45:49.67]There you go.
[45:50.11]Big soldiers getting destroyed.
[45:51.77]Nice.
[45:52.93]Nice.
[45:53.41]That was way cleaner than last time.
[45:56.48]There's a lot of money.
[45:57.12]I think getting my sentry in an actual good spot is probably helping.
[45:59.28]Can one of you, while I'm not down there, can one of you go grab that money before it goes away?
[46:03.74]Yeah, you don't get the money if you don't pick it up and it disappears.
[46:07.26]The money for upgrading.
[46:08.42]I got it.
[46:14.35]Sentry buster!
[46:15.77]Where's it at?
[46:17.96]Jesus yeah so a scout actually is the money collector oh it's that thing that exploded on me pick up your sentry and move it so it doesn't blow it up oh my god look at us look at us gaming okay uh bomb approaching on a scout I got a great view of that by the way you saw that yeah that was phenomenal
[46:44.78]Yeah, chat, I'm not going to know the meta.
[46:46.46]Like, I'm doing my best, but, like, it's going to take a while to learn meta.
[46:51.02]I'm just going to listen to Jerma.
[46:52.44]Don't do meta.
[46:53.20]Don't listen to Jerma.
[46:55.91]Well, listen to me for... I just got killed from behind by a sniper, so just don't listen to me.
[47:00.71]Oh, son of a bitch killed me.
[47:01.87]No, listen to me.
[47:05.99]Alright.
[47:07.13]Bomb's getting kind of close.
[47:08.39]Where are you at?
[47:08.91]Big round.
[47:12.60]It was a 30 kill round for me.
[47:14.44]Is that not bad?
[47:15.70]That's pretty damn good.
[47:17.50]Round's still going.
[47:18.56]Here we go.

[47:20.72]Just don't get too cocky.
[47:21.76]Yeah.
[47:23.52]I see how it works now.
[47:24.72]If you see money, grab it.
[47:27.30]Oh, shit.
[47:28.54]Why didn't Overwatch do this?
[47:29.44]This is crazy.
[47:31.68]Isn't this the most fun you've ever had in a video game?
[47:33.93]Why didn't they just do this?
[47:35.21]The most?
[47:36.45]I have never been happier.
[47:38.97]Okay, I got some stickies by the bomb here.
[47:42.27]These snipers are... It's like a fresh take on tower defense games.
[47:51.64]Nice.
[47:51.84]Okay, I was going to say.
[47:53.22]Overwatch has the workshop, which allows you to adjust all the attack speed and everything.
[47:59.22]Whoa!
[47:59.34]I hear a...
[48:03.58]That guy's close.
[48:05.56]They're gone now.
[48:06.89]We need to keep an eye on them.
[48:08.63]I'll be back here to keep an eye on the bomb.
[48:18.30]We're good.
[48:18.62]We're good.
[48:18.86]We're good.
[48:20.10]One scout going back.
[48:22.30]One scout.
[48:22.70]There's literally one scout.
[48:23.58]I'm not fast enough to get him.
[48:24.74]He's at the bomb right now.
[48:26.05]Nice.
[48:35.62]and that is a successful wave completed yeah nice job missing a little bit of money our scout should be picking that up hey we have a scout oh alright chat let's see what am I upgrading here now that I have all my damage up this is where I really shine as a vlog pyro find canteens okay I will but
[49:05.09]Uh, okay.
[49:20.29]Wait, I lost upgrades if you switch guns?
[49:21.57]Uh-oh.
[49:23.21]Yes, because all the upgrades, because there's so many different weapons in the game.
[49:27.21]It's individual to each item.
[49:29.76]Oh.
[49:30.90]Burn damage sucks, dude.
[49:32.18]What?
[49:32.68]Really?
[49:32.90]What do you mean?
[49:34.12]Burn damage is useless here?
[49:36.16]Why?
[49:36.52]I understand.
[49:37.10]I had the wrong one, too.
[49:41.61]It's already H?
[49:42.75]Okay.
[49:45.63]Like H Judd Benjamin.

[50:15.10]Health on kill is important, yeah.
[50:16.68]Do I need crit resistance for this wave?
[50:19.04]It's good to have anyways.
[50:23.80]Uh, for this wave, no.
[50:25.18]But not for this particular wave.
[50:26.37]Spies this wave, don't get backstabbed.
[50:29.03]Shit.
[50:29.25]I want the ammo.
[50:30.09]Alright, I'm good.
[50:33.09]Put it into jump height.
[50:34.49]Why would you ever put it into jump height?
[50:36.21]What would that do?
[50:38.11]Someone said, Vinny, I thought you were a pan lover.
[50:40.05]Zero upgrades.
[50:41.10]Sad face.
[50:43.72]Equip the pan.
[50:44.76]People do some goofy shit in Man vs Machine.
[50:46.38]It's like, oh yeah, I'm going to put on the fish and fully upgrade it and then do jump height and movement speed.
[50:53.02]It's like, okay, well, we're going to lose, but you're going to have a good time.
[50:55.72]Yeah, pretty much.
[50:56.28]Alright.
[50:58.68]Where should I post up as a machine gun enthusiast?
[51:02.36]So distance matters?
[51:04.11]Up with me is good because then you're near the dispenser.
[51:06.97]So you see... You'll be fine.
[51:08.29]You can all hang out with the... Like up here...
[51:11.08]Oh, where you guys are?

[51:12.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:13.92]They're coming.
[51:14.86]The box, like the refrigerator next to me, will heal you if you stand near it.
[51:20.68]I'll get this money in a second.
[51:21.62]I just made sure I took the most fall damage possible.
[51:29.52]Good job.
[51:31.04]Excellent work, Jeremy.
[51:32.32]Really happy with your performance.
[51:38.88]Ooh!
[51:41.85]I see.
[51:42.37]I should have stood closer to the refrigerator.
[51:44.95]We're good.
[51:46.59]Spies are here.
[51:48.70]If you think it's somebody, it might be somebody else.
[51:51.56]We need that money.
[51:53.04]I'm going.
[51:53.38]I got some of it.
[51:54.36]There's a lot still there.
[51:56.50]I'm going.
[51:57.44]I'm going.
[51:58.00]I'm going.
[51:58.44]Spies coming.
[51:59.68]Spies coming.
[52:02.58]Vinny, you blew yourself up.
[52:05.11]Alright, and you're surprised by that?
[52:06.57]Watch out for the sentry buster coming up the stairs right now!
[52:08.61]Okay.
[52:09.37]Sentry buster on the stairs!
[52:10.43]Sentry buster!
[52:11.23]Sentry buster on the stairs right now!
[52:16.67]I'm trying to kill it!
[52:18.51]Okay, we're good.
[52:20.33]Save.
[52:21.83]Huge scout.
[52:22.77]Big, very big scout.
[52:25.31]Wait, how far is he?
[52:26.75]I didn't know they made him that big.
[52:28.40]Is he dead?
[52:29.86]I don't think so.
[52:30.26]Is there another sentry buster?
[52:31.04]Yeah, he's dead, he's dead.
[52:31.88]Help!
[52:32.56]I'm getting stabbed!
[52:35.10]Sanji Buster on the stairs!
[52:36.12]Okay, that's fine, that's fine.
[52:38.59]I gotta get this fucking money.
[52:41.23]They got snipers.
[52:45.86]Dude, there's three.
[52:47.51]Big scout.
[52:48.39]Oh my God.
[52:48.95]He's going.
[52:49.63]He's going.
[52:50.53]The bomb real fast.
[52:51.49]No.
[52:51.79]Everyone, we got a problem on the left side.
[52:55.51]Oh.
[52:57.17]Spy.
[52:57.83]Alright.
[52:58.63]We need that money.
[52:59.37]Oh, we got the money.
[52:59.97]We're good.
[53:00.67]Oh, we're good.
[53:01.47]Spies.
[53:01.89]Oh, those were spies.
[53:02.87]Okay.
[53:04.33]Buster took out the spies.
[53:05.51]I'm not moving.
[53:06.89]A bunch of people ran by me.
[53:11.19]You got to move.
[53:12.05]I'm holding up the front.
[53:12.86]You guys can keep the back alive.
[53:15.36]That's a lot of money.
[53:16.50]Sentry bus are coming in.
[53:17.34]I don't know from where.
[53:19.48]Oh, shit.
[53:20.02]Scout.
[53:20.40]Scout.
[53:20.64]Scout.
[53:22.52]You don't know from where, Jerma?
[53:25.26]I got distracted.
[53:25.92]A scout was right here.
[53:27.07]I'm real.
[53:27.51]I'm real.
[53:27.83]I'm real.
[53:28.05]They come from the same place.
[53:29.01]Oh, God.
[53:30.13]Yeah, but I wasn't looking.
[53:32.33]And they always go to the sentry.
[53:35.15]Just stop shining a microscope onto how stupid I am.
[53:41.26]Whoa!
[53:42.58]Kind of free, to be honest, that wave.
[53:44.90]I missed a lot of money.
[53:50.69]Where's our scout at?
[53:51.37]I want to yell at them.
[53:53.45]It could be me.
[53:54.79]I'm supposed to be getting the money.
[53:56.81]My fault.
[53:58.01]Soldier's OP.
[53:59.45]Do you guys think that owning a microscope is a really terrible idea?
[54:03.14]In real life?
[54:04.14]Yeah, in real life.
[54:04.78]Like, buying a microscope, and I'll give you the thesis here.
[54:08.40]How much is the microscope?
[54:09.72]Like, a hundred bucks.
[54:10.88]like that's great you know like 10 bucks well it doesn't matter like it's not about how much it costs it's about what you would do when you had it and what I'm talking about here is I'm talking about I would get I would put a drop of water on that look at it from my sink or something and be like I'm never drinking water from here ever again oh yeah well I just realized a microscope's different than a telescope
[54:34.64]It's the opposite, yeah.
[54:36.44]There's actually this thing that went around recently, like, an article about how New York City water fountains have, like, little shrimps in them.
[54:43.64]So, like, when you're drinking out of a water fountain, there's, like, microscopic shrimps in the water.
[54:49.45]And I live in New York City.
[54:50.89]I will never touch that again unless I need protein.
[54:53.23]I mean, it's flavor, right?
[54:54.85]It's free flavoring.
[54:56.49]It is free flavoring.
[54:57.23]It's like drinking sea monkeys.
[55:00.41]Without having to pay, though.
[55:02.45]It's free sea monkeys.
[55:04.97]Free sea monkeys?
[55:06.27]Aw, nice.
[55:07.59]There you go.
[55:08.10]In this economy, you're going to give that up?
[55:11.98]Yeah, I don't... Is it dangerous if we all go to the same roof?
[55:15.90]It can be, but it does concentrate.
[55:18.16]It's a tank again, so we're going to need to be forward.
[55:22.02]Copy.
[55:22.78]You need big damage this round.
[55:24.12]In position, feeling good.
[55:25.52]Ready for a battle.
[55:26.32]Are we ready to battle?
[55:28.48]You probably do want to be over here because then you can heal off the refrigerator, but... No, thank you, sir.
[55:33.84]Alright.
[55:36.31]Be careful, fall damage does hurt.
[55:39.21]Hey, whoa.
[55:42.39]Are you telling us because you've learned from experience or you just know about it?
[55:45.58]I'm just telling you because I've taken 20% of my health off every round because I just keep jumping off of the roof.
[55:52.90]It's a disaster.
[55:53.52]I don't know if you know this, sometimes you're close to pushing me off.
[55:57.20]Oh, here we go.
[55:58.04]Okay, I'm activating my crits.
[55:59.54]Alright, let's go for it.
[56:00.90]We can melt this thing quick.
[56:05.77]Well, that was a quick, quick canteen.
[56:07.85]Yeah.
[56:11.43]Okay, we are fucking.
[56:12.89]Alright.
[56:14.01]Stop on the way.
[56:16.91]That was perfect placement of the, of the, you know, the thing that lights you up.
[56:21.15]Alright, heavies, the medics can Uber.
[56:22.68]Yeah, I, this is, I can't.
[56:25.86]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[56:28.94]I'm going, I got it, I'm going, I got it.
[56:32.23]Alright, I got it all.
[56:32.73]I got it all.
[56:33.01]We're good.
[56:34.53]Watch me kill this heavy in fucking 10 seconds.
[56:37.11]Dude, look at that.
[56:38.09]So good.
[56:38.39]You guys got the tank, right?
[56:39.51]Yep.
[56:39.75]Yeah, I got this guy.
[56:43.14]Tank down.
[56:43.74]Good shit.
[56:44.90]Good shit.
[56:45.32]Alright, where's the money?
[56:46.30]Wow.
[56:46.42]There's a little bit of money left.
[56:49.78]Okay, sentry buster coming up.
[56:51.40]Yep, yep, yep.
[56:53.18]Those things are so fucking loud.
[56:55.42]Oh.
[56:56.23]Oh.
[56:56.95]Where is he?
[56:57.83]Tank two.
[56:58.21]Another tank!
[56:59.21]Tank two!
[57:10.08]Oh, big heavy right around the corner.
[57:14.06]Oh, they're doing a lot of damage.
[57:16.04]Oh, shit.
[57:16.44]Alright, he's Ubered.
[57:17.16]He's Ubered.
[57:17.72]Go focus on the tank.
[57:20.35]I was trying to kill the medics before they could do it.
[57:24.93]Yeah, focus the medics always because they will Uber.
[57:30.55]I accidentally made them Uber.
[57:31.65]Alright, we got to focus on the tank too.
[57:38.51]I'm going to move that gear up.
[57:40.23]Oh, fuck.
[57:40.97]That's a good idea.
[57:42.99]I should get his tank.
[57:44.91]Or I will move that gear directly into a bunch of pyros.
[57:47.93]Tank should be fine.
[57:48.79]I think we're good.
[57:51.89]Where's the bottom graphic?
[57:54.64]What the hell?
[57:55.86]That's a good point.
[57:56.48]What does the bottom graphic mean?
[57:57.52]I think that's maybe the health of a certain enemy.
[58:00.30]The heavy's walking the bomb back.
[58:02.92]He's been walking the bomb back.
[58:04.20]Alright, focus on heavy.
[58:05.40]He's around the corner.
[58:06.72]Tank is down.
[58:09.30]oh god he's right there nice that was good oh we didn't collect a lot of money though we're about to get it we're about to see a big bump nice oh wow that was a huge bomb I mean you give me a tank and I say how high
[58:35.45]Does this round also have tanks?
[58:37.55]It does, and it also has permacrit soldiers.
[58:40.11]So this is the time to buy that crit resistance.
[58:43.62]Crit resistance purchased.
[58:45.90]Is this a blast resistant group, a fire group?
[58:49.12]This would be a blast resistant group as well as a bullet resistant group.
[58:55.05]Let me go.
[58:55.63]Let me do this.
[58:56.39]Let me do this.
[58:58.17]Ooh.
[58:59.23]There are no tanks this round.
[59:00.93]There are only... I consider myself a tank, Jerma, to be honest.
[59:07.62]Chat's like, check.
[59:08.36]You got a notification.
[59:09.30]I find piss.
[59:12.30]God damn it.

[59:15.74]Oh, penultimate.
[59:17.88]I think this is wave, what wave?
[59:20.63]There's seven waves in this one.
[59:23.21]This feels penultimate, but my math has never been good.
[59:27.47]It's got a penultimate vibe to it.
[59:35.96]Let's get it.
[59:36.74]How we feel?

[60:55.17]Wow.
[60:58.36]These beans are great.
[61:04.66]What's G do?
[61:07.26]What does G do?
[61:07.68]Why would you tell me to press G?
[61:09.26]Oh, G is taunt.

[61:40.99]Shit.
[61:46.11]Whoa, Medic went flying.
[61:48.19]Why is this guy invincible?
[61:49.05]Because their medics are Ubering him.
[61:52.91]Yeah.
[61:53.69]Medic is always a good target.
[61:55.15]I'm dead right now.
[62:00.57]Heal Medic!

[62:54.52]Up until then, it was going pretty good.
[62:57.70]It's going great.
[62:58.74]I think we're champions.
[63:02.64]Sentry buster and then that's it.
[63:05.23]Big heavy.
[63:06.95]Alright, sentry buster coming up.
[63:08.65]Yep.
[63:11.91]I'm going to lose this war.
[63:19.18]I think it's just this heavy big heavy big heavy has the bomb and it's coming up like the left side you said press m chat bomb is down they said m for medic it's a good guess oh come on I got it I got him I got him good alright just the soldier and that's it
[63:45.75]I think there's like a few dollars hanging out somewhere.
[63:47.95]Yeah.
[63:48.65]Let's go.
[63:49.48]There's 50 bucks.
[63:52.14]There we go.
[63:52.60]Got it all.
[63:53.48]What?
[63:54.02]I mean, who even needs money anymore?
[63:56.70]Yeah, we... Is it bad if you die here?
[64:00.75]So this is it.
[64:01.37]This is the big one.
[64:04.54]three tanks oh three tanks so just right so just to let everybody know that hasn't really played mvm the scout is the money collector class and it's usually required somebody is almost required to do it uh you get healed when you pick the money up as a scout he also has like a big radius around him that picks it up for free but we're at the last round I don't we're doing just fine
[64:29.98]What should I get as an upgrade for the last round?
[64:32.06]Any resistances?
[64:33.84]Like crit resistance, maybe?
[64:36.79]There's one big crit soldier.
[64:40.73]The rest are all just big.
[64:41.81]I think our biggest problem is going to be the tanks.
[64:46.41]I agree.
[64:46.86]This is a lot of blast and bullet damage.
[64:54.40]I'm just going to go resistance.
[64:56.92]I'm just going to max myself out.
[65:02.71]Are you having a smashing good time?
[65:04.49]I am.
[65:05.05]Actually am.
[65:08.05]Actually?
[65:08.90]Because you usually aren't.
[65:09.90]When are we gonna play 7 Days to Die?
[65:13.30]Oh, I played a lot of that one.
[65:16.56]Question.
[65:19.45]They got a huge update.
[65:21.79]What should I avoid here?
[65:22.73]Should I avoid penetration or should I get some resistances?
[65:29.48]Resistance is a big deal now because pretty much everything we're fighting is big.
[65:36.74]So they'll kill you in two seconds.
[65:40.68]You can never go wrong with move speed and jump speed.
[65:43.49]Move speed is actually insanely important.
[65:46.29]I don't have any of it though.
[65:54.78]Are there crits in this one?
[65:57.18]There is one giant crit soldier.
[66:00.36]So, yeah.
[66:02.40]We should be able to get rid of it pretty quickly, though.
[66:03.82]Okay.
[66:06.64]What about fire resistance?
[66:09.21]No pyros.
[66:10.35]So fire is not necessary.
[66:13.01]Resistance true.
[66:14.69]The only thing that we have is bullet and blast and crit.
[66:19.12]Use crits before shooting stickies.
[66:20.86]Got it.
[66:21.18]Thanks, chat.
[66:21.96]Also, too, after we do this, everyone's going to, the reason why you use that, that tour of duty ticket is because we're all going to get an item after this and it could be something cool.
[66:31.27]If anyone gets an Australian, those sell for like $100,000.
[66:34.23]What's an Australian?
[66:37.74]It's like a human weapon.
[66:40.46]No, not an Australian.
[66:42.36]It's an Australian.
[66:43.40]Oh.
[66:46.07]Alright, I'm ready.
[66:46.69]Like a person.
[66:47.81]Yeah, like an actual person.
[66:49.47]Find the Australian.
[66:50.65]Uh oh.
[66:52.83]Alright, what do we got first?
[66:55.60]Probably tank.
[66:56.96]What does that mean?
[66:57.92]Alright, big scout.
[67:02.78]I'm going to slow them.
[67:03.88]I'm going to slow these scouts.
[67:07.64]I didn't do it.
[67:09.72]Oh my god, oh my god.
[67:11.42]They don't seem very slow.
[67:12.65]He's gonna go all the way.
[67:15.17]He's going literally all the way.
[67:16.61]This one's on me.
[67:18.71]Is he going all the way?
[67:20.95]He's going for speed.
[67:22.25]Oh, he is going all the way, isn't he?
[67:25.37]Oops.
[67:28.12]Oh.
[67:28.24]Let's go!
[67:28.80]Save!
[67:29.20]Whoa!
[67:29.82]Holy shit.
[67:31.42]That's... What?
[67:31.98]Another one, another one.
[67:32.88]That was my bad.
[67:34.70]Wait, so it's not over?
[67:35.66]No, we're good.
[67:36.26]Yeah, we're okay.
[67:37.18]Oh, I just died for some reason.
[67:39.76]It's fine.
[67:40.46]I need to get new items.
[67:41.78]Somebody should probably hang back in the defense area.
[67:44.59]I'll hang back.
[67:45.73]What do you think?
[67:46.43]As a demo, should I hang back or am I needed against the tank?
[67:49.25]Just hover that thing with stickies for the bomb.
[67:55.04]Big heavy on the right side.
[67:55.92]He's pretty low though.
[67:57.60]He should be dead.
[67:58.38]Why'd you walk in a straight line at the heavy?
[68:05.60]Geez, that's a big gun.
[68:07.10]Heavy dead.
[68:08.28]Heavy dead.
[68:09.46]Giant charge soldier walking over three homies.
[68:13.02]Oh, boy.
[68:13.54]I did not like the sound of that tank.
[68:17.75]Oh, yeah, because you're a flogger.
[68:18.87]We have a tank coming in.
[68:20.63]Did you forget what I was playing?
[68:23.71]I don't know.
[68:24.11]I thought... I guess it just takes over your brain.
[68:34.14]Don't kill me, please.
[68:40.47]now the tank coming up no I right click I can melt this one I don't know what to do chat I'm confused oh oh oh god can I get you up I don't know how to scout's going left side alright yeah if a single scout makes a pass we're in trouble
[69:00.23]Alright, it's okay, it's okay.
[69:01.75]Speaking of which... Alright, nice.
[69:03.55]Ooh, that actually helped.
[69:04.65]No, please don't kill me.
[69:06.49]Nice.
[69:06.95]Okay, we're okay.
[69:10.71]How is the backflip right now?
[69:11.75]I can't aim at anything.
[69:12.97]I'm keeping an eye on the back with bombs right now.
[69:15.13]I can't help with the tank though.
[69:16.32]I have to kind of... I got the tank.
[69:18.12]There's like four scouts going to the point.
[69:20.98]Let's shoot.
[69:23.58]Sentry back here should cover the point.
[69:25.00]I belong on this character just because the shoe's alone.
[69:31.91]As a reminder, you can press H when you die to respawn instantly.
[69:35.66]Oh yeah, for this round, that sounds like a good idea.
[69:37.90]Yeah, there's no reason not to.
[69:39.44]Okay, tank, tank is coming.
[69:40.86]Yeah, we gotta kill that tank.
[69:42.46]Like, now.
[69:43.86]What happened?
[69:44.50]There's a hole in the floor, by the way, heads up.
[69:47.28]There sure is.
[69:48.87]Yeah, there is a hole, that's right.
[69:51.03]I completely forgot about that.
[69:52.11]There's a one health soldier on the right.
[69:56.91]I'm sticking the tank with crits.
[70:00.11]I'm down.
[70:00.67]I'm down.
[70:00.97]I'm down.
[70:01.29]I'm going to respawn immediately, but we got a problem with that bomb.
[70:04.41]That bomb is scaring me right now.
[70:06.33]I'll get the bomb.
[70:06.83]I got the bomb.
[70:07.31]Don't worry about the bomb.
[70:07.95]Focus on the... Tank is down.
[70:11.56]Tank is down.
[70:12.20]Okay.
[70:12.70]Soldier coming up the other side.
[70:14.14]Excellent work.
[70:14.74]Excellent work.
[70:15.50]Buy crit canteens.
[70:17.00]Buy crit canteens.
[70:18.06]Crit canteens.
[70:29.06]Okay.
[70:29.82]We got a second here where we can kind of relax.
[70:32.07]Yeah.
[70:33.73]Sniper.
[70:34.27]We got this.
[70:34.69]We got this.
[70:35.21]Oh, watch out for the sniper.
[70:44.18]Scout.
[70:46.94]Nice.
[70:47.12]Alright.
[70:49.76]Huge soldier coming in with a bunch of scouts.
[70:52.73]He's very hurt.
[70:55.97]What side?
[70:56.69]Right or left?
[70:57.11]They're coming in the right.
[70:59.17]Oh, right.
[71:00.57]Yeah.
[71:01.53]It's weird because depending on the direction.
[71:02.57]Whoa, I actually took a teleporter.
[71:03.45]That's not good.
[71:09.90]Whoa, what happened?
[71:10.58]Wait, what?
[71:11.28]Fuck.
[71:11.72]What happened?
[71:12.80]Did just one get through?
[71:14.16]Oh.
[71:14.38]I detonated at just the moment, chat.
[71:15.66]It was like a second.
[71:16.32]Is it continue or vote restart?
[71:23.42]No, we're good.
[71:23.90]No, no, no.
[71:24.49]Continue, continue.
[71:25.21]Yeah, just continue.
[71:25.71]We'll restart resets from round one.
[71:27.63]Oh, okay.
[71:29.57]Kat, you saw that.
[71:30.09]I forgot you could upgrade your character.
[71:31.91]You heard the trigger.
[71:33.11]Wait, how do you upgrade a character?
[71:35.19]Wait.
[71:35.41]You click your character icon, you get movement speed and stuff.
[71:38.60]Yeah, blast resistance.
[71:40.82]Bullet resistance is really important.
[71:43.10]I forgot about that.
[71:44.92]Oh.
[71:47.02]Is there a lot of blasts in this one?
[71:50.99]Hmm.
[71:51.51]This is very heavy on blast.
[71:56.65]A lot of infinite soldiers, a big crit soldier.
[72:01.31]Although there are a lot of bullet scouts, so... We did fine that time.
[72:07.25]I think we're good.
[72:10.70]Once the bomb gets that close, I'll just leave the level 3 back there, and then you guys hold forward.
[72:16.72]That alert was on screen for like a second, and then I, yeah, it was just too much.
[72:21.52]It was too close.
[72:28.25]Then you would have won if you used the frying pan.
[72:31.27]Should I get knockback rage?
[72:33.03]That's the one.
[72:35.38]Um, knockback is really good.
[72:38.51]It's actually insanely powerful.
[72:40.61]Especially versus sentry busters.
[72:42.33]Because you can just hold the... Just track them, and they'll fly across the map.
[72:49.29]And that's very helpful for me, because then I don't have to move my sentry around.
[72:51.75]I know a lot of people right now are going to say, hey, don't listen to Jerma.
[72:55.72]That's a terrible strategy, but hey.
[72:58.49]They instantly said knockback halves your damage.
[73:00.56]He's so dumb.
[73:01.28]Don't get it.
[73:01.78]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[73:05.08]Yeah.
[73:06.50]They're really upset at you.
[73:07.98]Why are robots attacking the old west ghost town?
[73:10.88]Are we in it?
[73:11.91]We're in it.
[73:12.75]We're in it to win it.
[73:13.57]Let's go.
[73:13.99]I want to hear at least some enthusiasm from us.
[73:16.05]Okay, buddy.
[73:16.83]Yeah.
[73:17.77]Enthusiasm on three.
[73:19.61]One.
[73:19.75]Hell yeah.
[73:20.43]Two.
[73:21.21]Three.
[73:22.35]Yeah.
[73:23.42]Yay.
[73:23.90]Yay.
[73:29.22]It's going all the way again.
[73:30.34]That fucking scout has got the bomb and is going all the way.
[73:33.01]He's gonna go all the way.
[73:33.81]Going the distance is going for speed.
[73:37.33]I am so hurt right now.
[73:38.33]I was too busy doing this stupid fucking voice.
[73:42.72]Oh, the... Oh, boy.
[73:43.98]Okay.
[73:44.54]Alright.
[73:44.76]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[73:45.30]Oh, it's... Shh.
[73:51.67]Oh, God.
[73:52.63]I did not want to drop down.
[73:53.57]Okay, left Ubers.
[73:56.00]Left Heavy's Ubered.
[73:57.28]I don't even know what to do about that right now, chat.
[74:00.40]That was my fault.
[74:00.98]I was supposed to kill the medics.
[74:01.96]That's my fault.
[74:03.66]Alright, right Heavy's done.
[74:04.70]We just need left one.
[74:05.94]This is a huge pyro.
[74:06.92]Oh, God.
[74:07.14]I'm sorry.
[74:08.40]No.
[74:10.74]Someone keeps making them pop Uber.
[74:12.44]Oh, God.
[74:21.74]okay back to uh back to square one oh okay here come the tanks I'm just getting bullied oh that was great I have a lot of courage I'm gonna go focus on the soldier is pretty low but I'm gonna focus on the tank and the money oops sentry buster is right here careful careful I can focus tank
[74:58.33]Give us all crits, I think.
[75:03.19]Bunch of people going up.
[75:04.79]Oh.
[75:05.15]Oh, what?
[75:05.94]We all lost, I think.
[75:07.22]We're good.
[75:07.84]I can handle the scout guy this time.
[75:12.20]I'm ready.
[75:13.28]I can slow him.
[75:14.56]I can knock him back at the start, too.
[75:16.04]I should do that.
[75:18.03]I can also just leave my level 3 at the spawn for the start.
[75:21.61]That might just be the best.
[75:23.35]I'm ready now.
[75:24.43]Yeah, there's a lot of scouts.
[75:25.54]It's just a ton of them.
[75:26.60]Yeah.
[75:27.50]It's that beginning segment is a nightmare.
[75:34.50]Doubters are winning.
[75:36.74]Yeah, we'll get it.
[75:37.79]Okay, are the initial scouts running down the left or right path?
[75:42.25]Switch the pipe bomb for faster damage in a pinch.
[75:45.03]Use your grenades.
[75:45.69]My grenades are weak.
[75:47.79]If they haven't been upgraded by this point, they're not as good as the stickies.
[75:51.51]Yeah.
[75:52.27]Someone said firing speed is glitched, so you can't do it past one.
[75:56.43]Is that true?
[75:56.99]Is this fake news?
[75:58.51]I don't know.
[75:58.97]That might be.
[75:59.89]Is that real?
[76:03.29]Chat, is that real?
[76:05.58]True is true.
[76:06.20]It's actually true.
[76:08.20]Only the second tier is glitched.
[76:12.80]So if you do three, it will fix it?
[76:16.74]Tiers 3 and beyond are fine, apparently.
[76:18.66]So you'd have to do two points in it.
[76:28.08]What's the sticky?
[76:29.37]It's 14 stickies at a time?
[76:31.57]We could try all sniper here if it doesn't work.
[76:34.77]Well, yeah, that'll definitely work.
[76:36.43]Yeah.
[76:37.36]We will find a way to beat this.
[76:39.50]I could also go scout or medic.
[76:41.10]We're totally fine.
[76:43.30]Everything we did was good.
[76:44.90]Let's ready up and we'll just kill the scouts.
[76:47.22]Amen.
[76:48.00]Amen.
[76:48.29]I agree.
[76:50.71]Why do you have Victorian Lord hair?
[76:52.55]Ban that person for at least a month.
[77:00.70]Aw, shucks.
[77:03.31]Frankly, you almost had it the first time.
[77:04.71]Yeah, we were really close.
[77:06.81]We could have done that.
[77:07.71]How do I activate?
[77:08.69]Rage?
[77:09.23]Fluke.
[77:10.99]I think right click?
[77:12.33]It's whatever the special E is, right?
[77:15.01]I don't know.
[77:15.99]It's that or middle mouse, I think.
[77:17.33]It's possible that it's not bound.
[77:19.19]You might have to bind it.
[77:20.16]Let's do it.
[77:24.70]Let's do it.
[77:25.94]Alright.
[77:26.52]This one's for real.
[77:32.92]I miss every hit.
[77:42.15]Okay.
[77:43.69]I wish I had put my sentry closer.
[77:50.17]Great start.
[77:51.21]Great killer start.
[77:54.06]Don't shoot him.
[77:54.56]Don't shoot him.
[77:55.42]No, shoot him.
[77:56.46]I got the thing on the medical.
[77:58.16]Okay.
[77:59.78]That's what I was supposed to do last time and I failed miserably.
[78:02.50]That's sniper job because I could just kill all the medics with one shot.
[78:07.04]Oh, money doesn't matter anymore, by the way.
[78:08.41]So, well, it does.
[78:09.25]It kind of matters.
[78:10.61]Dude, money doesn't... What?
[78:12.55]This guy just destroyed capitalism with one comment.
[78:19.87]Kind of quiet.
[78:22.54]Coming around this side.
[78:23.42]Let's see if I can... Oh, shit.
[78:25.82]Oh, there's a sniper.
[78:27.48]Where'd they even come from?
[78:30.60]Snuck in.
[78:33.81]Oh, sniper down the road.
[78:35.91]Tank coming in.
[78:37.89]He dodged.
[78:41.64]Alright, two tanks back to back here.
[78:43.22]I'm going to just focus on the scouts.
[78:49.76]I think I got them all.
[78:59.73]Nice.
[79:00.17]Good shit on the rail.
[79:00.99]Well done.
[79:01.41]That was fast.
[79:03.62]Wow, guys.
[79:06.04]Wow.
[79:07.06]The character progression was really inside you the whole time.
[79:10.26]Or someone activated their hacks.
[79:11.60]Alright, don't get cocky.
[79:19.17]I'm raging this guy.
[79:19.99]Nice.
[79:21.29]Backing him up all the way.
[79:22.27]Thanks.
[79:35.44]Sniper on the left and Soldier coming in.
[79:37.32]Alright, Soldier.
[79:44.30]I can't see!
[79:44.98]I don't even know.
[79:45.48]Yeah, I can't see shit.
[79:46.36]Too smoky.
[79:46.95]Too smoky.
[79:47.35]Nice.
[79:47.45]Gonna use that.
[79:49.41]That's alright.
[79:51.85]Buster.
[79:53.15]Yeah.
[79:56.49]Oh, nice.
[79:56.79]We're killing him.
[79:58.65]He is... Kill the Buster.
[79:59.49]Kill the Buster.
[79:59.83]Hit the Buster.
[80:00.57]On the way up.
[80:01.53]Oh, he killed the Soldier, too.
[80:03.47]Oh, that was awesome.
[80:05.08]Well played.
[80:05.62]I mean, we have him so stunlocked.
[80:07.64]Yeah, this is going way, way better.
[80:10.37]I don't know why.
[80:18.77]Bad sticky death.
[80:19.69]Bad sticky death.
[80:23.73]I'm going to eat this.
[80:27.97]You just taunt him?
[80:29.01]Yeah, the weapon I have, when I build a meter, I taunt and I get 100% crit.
[80:35.35]Hell yeah.
[80:36.83]It's a great weapon.
[80:38.29]But don't tell anybody I said that, though.
[80:42.69]It is the single most hated weapon in this game.
[80:45.63]Which one?
[80:46.71]Log.
[80:47.37]Oh.
[80:47.65]Yeah, I don't have that one.
[80:52.45]Are there medics on the... Oh, a lot of scouts, a lot of scouts.
[80:54.59]Sentry Buster's low.
[80:59.53]Wait, is he alive, though?
[81:01.19]Oh, he's... Oh, sh...
[81:06.06]Nice rocket.
[81:06.78]I'm out of there.
[81:08.40]Thank you.
[81:14.64]Fuck.
[81:18.52]Oh, Scout.
[81:19.66]Yeah, Scout's past.
[81:20.28]Shoot him.
[81:21.06]Yeah, Scout's past.
[81:22.12]It's hard to detonate these stickies so soon.
[81:24.83]No, we're good now.
[81:25.41]We're good now.
[81:25.85]This is it here.
[81:39.41]I got to say, guys, great work.
[81:41.95]It's just an amazing time to be a gamer.
[81:46.57]All the great games we have in the year 2023.
[81:48.41]All the titles.
[81:51.33]The library.
[81:53.57]One more tank and we're done.
[81:55.63]We might get scouts that might just be trickling out, so be careful.
[82:00.21]This is it.
[82:01.65]Is the sentry buster alive?
[82:03.55]Nope.
[82:07.19]My rage does not work against this tank.
[82:11.81]Yeah, unfortunately.
[82:12.61]Alright, pop the bottles here.
[82:21.15]This is time to celebrate.
[82:28.69]What?
[82:29.71]Another one.
[82:31.35]They just keep coming.
[82:32.23]Alright, we don't know any better.
[82:34.22]Hopefully somebody gets the $100,000 item.
[82:35.58]Hell yeah.
[82:36.08]Okay.
[82:36.38]Oh.
[82:42.10]I got the, the, oh wait.
[82:44.40]It's switching.
[82:45.88]Oh yeah, it goes through.
[82:47.18]The screen's gray.
[82:50.56]Exiting to main menu in 160 seconds.
[82:53.73]Do I get all of these?
[82:54.65]Oh, I just got the robot running, man.
[82:57.07]My overlay.
[82:59.03]I got a hat?
[82:59.77]Lord, you just got a hat.
[83:01.29]Yeah.
[83:02.51]I have like eight of these shields.
[83:03.87]What is this?
[83:05.38]You got to finish your tour to get the good stuff.
[83:08.48]Is this good?
[83:11.42]That's so funny.
[83:13.62]The Robot Running Man.
[83:15.34]Yeah, that was fun.
[83:17.98]Yeah, that was great.
[83:18.87]That was actually sick.
[83:19.95]Resume game, yeah?
[83:21.83]How do you guys feel?
[83:22.45]Do you guys want to do another one?
[83:23.83]Oh, yeah, I would do another one.
[83:25.65]Oh, yeah.
[83:26.87]You could sway me to do one more, yeah, for sure.
[83:28.63]Okay, you could do that.
[83:29.47]Yeah.
[83:30.98]It's rare but worthless.
[83:32.70]I just pressed J and it's so loud.
[83:35.72]Like hemorrhoids?
[83:39.10]What the heck just happened?
[83:41.48]Thanks for playing Man vs. Machine.
[83:42.92]Man up for more.
[83:44.45]See you guys next week.
[83:48.67]Okay, so... Lud, you gotta put that hat on.
[83:54.71]Yeah, I'm ready for a swag off.
[83:58.05]So if we have time to do one more, maybe.
[84:02.05]Maybe another one.
[84:03.23]I would love one more.
[84:04.09]Let's get it going.
[84:05.93]So I should be scout.
[84:06.83]I feel like that's what we needed last time, right?
[84:09.74]I could scout.
[84:11.14]Come on, I got it.
[84:13.94]I'd love to snipe.
[84:14.98]It would be so beautiful.
[84:17.50]Soldier was my calling.
[84:20.62]I enjoyed soldier.
[84:21.80]Before I can really determine what I want to do, I think I'm going to have to open a crate to determine what that is.
[84:27.20]Yeah, I just opened a handful.
[84:28.82]Let's see.
[84:32.05]How does this affect society?
[84:35.85]How do you get a crate?
[84:37.69]This has affected society greatly over the years.
[84:39.99]There's many studies that have been done on it.
[84:42.03]They drop, but you can go to steamcommunitymarket.com and buy in bulk.
[84:46.95]I shouldn't do this.
[84:48.03]It should not be shown on stream.
[84:49.96]Yeah, don't do it on stream.
[84:50.88]Yeah, don't do it on stream, whatever you do.
[84:53.65]I don't need to buy this.
[84:54.85]I'm buying two keys, chat.
[84:56.60]I'm gonna do it.
[84:57.14]I'm gonna open the summer crates that I have.
[84:59.08]I don't believe in gambling.
[84:59.94]You know what?
[85:00.38]I'm gonna... I want a strange... a Flog Strangifier.
[85:06.36]I might have one, actually.
[85:07.10]Let me look.
[85:10.79]I'm opening something.
[85:13.07]What do you get?
[85:14.15]This is the dopamine, chat.
[85:15.25]Let's see what we get.
[85:17.91]Come on, Poke.
[85:18.54]Something good.
[85:18.92]I'm getting...
[85:21.86]Killstreak Vaccinator Kit.
[85:24.22]Nice.
[85:25.80]Cool.
[85:29.44]Nobody else said nice.
[85:31.98]I mean, good job.
[85:33.22]Yeah, thanks, Trevor.
[85:35.83]It was just crickets.
[85:37.97]Chet, did I not buy the right key again?
[85:39.65]Oh, it's the cosmetic key.
[85:42.91]I just got the exact same thing twice.
[85:44.95]I'm done.
[85:45.59]Gambling is crazy.
[85:48.13]Oh, wait, you know what?
[85:48.67]That's fine.
[85:49.63]That's what I want.
[85:50.25]No, no, no.
[85:50.57]It's good.
[85:50.89]It's good.
[85:51.42]I got this.
[85:51.92]Watch chat.
[85:52.50]Look, open with key.
[85:55.52]No, no, no.
[85:55.76]It's not wasted.
[85:56.58]I actually really wanted this.
[85:57.74]I'm serious.
[85:58.82]I got a Cow Mangler, Strangifier.
[86:01.18]I'm playing with it.
[86:02.08]I'm being soldier and I'm doing Cow Mangler.
[86:03.61]Cargo constructor.
[86:05.31]Oh, a Cow Mangler can't hurt buildings and they're robots and they're technically buildings.
[86:09.59]Wait, it doesn't work?
[86:14.45]Somebody just told me the spy from TF2 is French.
[86:16.52]Is that true?
[86:17.66]Yes.
[86:17.92]Yeah, oui, oui.
[86:19.08]Unless he's been pretending.
[86:21.24]Another Frenchman.
[86:23.62]And he goes, I murdered your toys as well.
[86:28.25]Is that your French, Jerma?
[86:30.63]That's my spy.
[86:31.35]That's French.
[86:33.03]Give me your French.
[86:34.59]Yeah, give me something to say.
[86:37.51]And have it make sure it's not like, oh, he poop pooped his pants.
[86:40.80]That's what he's going to say.
[86:42.40]I would like for you to say in a French accent, is this really it?
[86:48.86]Is this all you have on the menu?
[86:50.73]Okay.
[86:52.79]How do I say that?
[86:54.31]With a French accent.
[86:55.85]Oh, I thought you wanted me to say it in French.
[86:58.33]I thought you were going to say it in French.
[87:03.95]Okay, what is it?
[87:06.19]Uh, is this it?
[87:06.87]Is this all you have on the menu?
[87:08.77]Is this it?
[87:09.67]Is this all you have on the menu?
[87:10.97]Wow, that's really good.
[87:13.03]That's really good.
[87:15.05]Phenomenal.
[87:15.55]Is this all you have on the menu?
[87:19.13]I'm impressed.
[87:20.04]His U's are insane.
[87:22.46]Sacre bleu.
[87:25.10]So, what is this explosive headshots?
[87:28.62]What sniper rifle is good for this game mode?
[87:30.70]Any recs?
[87:32.82]Um...
[87:35.12]I was just using the default.
[87:37.93]The Hitman Hitmaker apparently is good.
[87:40.19]What do you think?
[87:40.63]Jurati as well?
[87:41.65]Maybe?
[87:41.99]Throw some piss.
[87:42.47]Oh, Bizarre Bargain would be really good.
[87:44.69]I do have that.
[87:48.75]Heatmaker would be pretty good.
[87:49.79]Bizarre Bargain, I'd go with that.
[87:50.85]Oh, my chat's answering you.
[87:51.83]Heatmaker.
[87:52.37]Yeah, everyone's spamming it.
[87:54.56]Is anybody going heavy?
[87:56.24]I'll do Hitman.
[87:57.98]You want me to go heavy?
[87:58.70]I can go back.
[87:59.32]I can go back to my always.
[88:00.72]Because I can go Medic instead of Enji this round and then actually heal people.
[88:06.71]but we probably want a heavy or soldier you all need a carry I got it you know it's not you can also go engineer super fun is it the same map uh nope this is different whoa this is much shorter this map is very short so this one is this one could be hard two soldiers bad any crits in this round no we can do two soldiers
[88:36.80]cool crits uh wave one we should be alright I don't think we need to buy too much the cheater's lament is one of the rarest items in the game why do I even have the cheater's lament what does that mean does it mean what I think it means you have a vac ban
[89:00.39]no it's just old it's an exploit item everyone has that alright well thanks for making me feel special chat everybody everybody has that dude let's go let's go let's go ready alright so they this one is kind of annoying right because they can actually go up top up here right they can go through these now me standing here they can't it's true
[89:30.59]Who's our engineer?
[89:32.89]We do not have one.
[89:35.37]So that could be... That's not good.
[89:38.05]Too alarming.
[89:38.59]Could be an issue.
[89:44.32]One sec.
[89:44.92]We do have a scout and we do have a medic.
[89:46.76]So I think we'll be alright.
[89:47.46]I'm gonna purchase a Kritz Krieg.
[89:50.38]Because apparently I threw mine out.
[89:52.88]Give me just a sec.
[89:56.93]I love this thing.
[89:57.57]I don't know if everybody hates when I play with this and they go, dude, this weapon fucking sucks.
[90:01.64]Like, take it off.
[90:02.40]And I'm just like, no.
[90:04.40]Which one?
[90:05.28]Cowboy.
[90:12.10]This is punch heavy.
[90:14.18]What is man up mode?
[90:16.16]That means we use the ticket to play the game.
[90:19.01]Sick.
[90:19.57]Okay.
[90:21.07]Alright, let's do this double soldier.
[90:27.95]Oh, right.
[90:29.55]No NG.
[90:30.49]Ooh, big balls.
[90:33.50]Like that ACDC song.
[90:36.26]Big balls?
[90:37.22]Yeah.
[90:44.32]Who's this guy flying around the map?
[90:50.84]Somebody flying?
[90:52.64]Yeah, one of us.
[90:53.29]I'm scouting.
[90:56.33]Oh, the scout.
[90:57.25]Yep.
[90:59.34]He's gonna have the money.
[91:00.48]You guys like money?
[91:02.76]I heard it doesn't matter anymore though.
[91:06.62]Anytime you hear the woo, that means you're gonna get healed every time you hurt something.
[91:12.04]He's going through!
[91:13.92]Big scout.
[91:14.57]Uh-oh.
[91:17.71]Get him!
[91:18.73]Oh no!
[91:20.99]That was not even close.
[91:25.38]Okay, I'm gonna switch off soldier here.
[91:33.80]That was fast.
[91:37.99]What's wrong?
[91:38.27]Was that impressive chat?
[91:41.49]Oh shit, that was bad.
[91:45.25]No, let me try sniper one more time.
[91:47.13]Who's going to engineer?
[91:47.83]Because I don't know how.
[91:49.84]I'm too stupid for that.
[91:52.48]I could go, Engie.
[91:55.88]Alright, this is better.
[91:56.86]I can do NG.
[91:57.22]Poke, if you want to play something else, I'll play NG.
[91:59.52]B-I-N-G-O.
[92:04.48]I can do Bing.
[92:05.10]Bing?
[92:06.12]Okay.
[92:07.38]Hey, take a look at my wrench, everybody.
[92:12.44]I just want to let you know what is possible to get from this game mode.
[92:19.95]Whoa.
[92:22.43]Yeah, take a look at my wrench was a disturbing sentence.
[92:24.55]I didn't think that's what you meant.
[92:27.05]Oh, the Sydney Sleeper also increases piss cooldown.
[92:30.39]I understand.
[92:33.45]Yeah, we need more piss right now.
[92:34.41]Uh, I want the frontier justice.
[92:39.24]I'm ready.
[92:41.38]I am almost ready.
[92:42.92]And headshot, though.
[92:44.48]And I'm ready to deliver justice.
[92:46.06]Alright, Lud, I have Kritzkrieg, which means I'll give you 10 seconds of Kritz, where you will just annihilate everything.
[92:51.45]So I'll give you the heads up when you do that.
[92:52.63]But then... Can we get a code word?
[92:53.97]Can we get a code word?
[92:55.62]Um, I mean, I would have thought the word crits, but maybe bagel puss.
[93:00.09]Was the word bagel puss?
[93:02.87]Bagel puss.
[93:03.91]Bagel puss.
[93:05.01]Alright, if I hear that, I know to shoot.
[93:07.59]I will not shoot until then.
[93:09.79]Scream as loud as you can when you need it.
[93:11.35]It's the only way.
[93:12.05]He'll mishear you, unless you do it.
[93:14.77]Spencer's going right here.
[93:16.85]Which is protected enough from the enemies, but... Whoa, why is my health booming?
[93:22.44]Medic.
[93:22.84]Medic does overheal.
[93:24.32]Gives you a little boost.
[93:26.28]Pretty sick.
[93:28.76]Wait, why is he going away?
[93:30.73]Unless I'm healing you.
[93:32.41]Ludwig.
[93:33.13]I don't need upgrades.
[93:36.71]$100 rock, paper, scissors right now.
[93:38.73]How do I rock, paper, scissors?
[93:39.97]You walk up to him and press G. Let's see it.
[93:41.87]$100.
[93:44.11]Ludwig just won $100.
[93:46.57]I'm the TF2 player here.
[93:47.61]This is bullshit.
[93:52.38]Yeah, if your chat was playing, maybe.
[93:53.68]I just shot myself with a fucking rocket and I thought it'd be really funny.
[93:56.35]A good reference.
[94:00.21]It was funny on my screen.
[94:01.45]Do we have a battle siren?
[94:09.24]Is somebody else's microwave going off?
[94:14.66]Oh god, I gotta go get my Hot Pockets.
[94:17.90]Can we pause?
[94:21.11]Yeah, bro, you always get a pause for a minute.
[94:22.95]Get a hot rocket, of course.
[94:24.29]Chad, this isn't going so great.
[94:25.37]What are you talking about?
[94:27.21]We're doing awesome.
[94:28.15]Oh, you guys are doing awesome.
[94:30.42]What's wrong?
[94:30.82]I'm working through some things.
[94:32.24]Hold on a minute.
[94:33.24]I'm out of ammo.
[94:34.38]I didn't know that was even possible.
[94:36.30]Why did I go that far?
[94:39.06]Damn.
[94:40.44]I'm entering your bagel pussy.
[94:41.55]Go.
[94:42.33]Bagel plus, bagel plus.
[94:44.27]You should save that for the big scouts.
[94:47.09]Yeah, I thought he was about to die.
[94:53.00]Yeah, no, I see what you mean right now.
[94:55.78]I can see how it would have been nice to have that right now.
[94:59.31]You're going to come back to life in a second.
[95:01.19]I am locked in right now.
[95:02.37]We're going to be just fine.
[95:04.11]Cool.
[95:05.85]Bow for this mode.
[95:06.91]Honestly, you're not wrong, chat member.
[95:08.67]Nice.
[95:09.37]Good shit.
[95:14.68]Where's the shield now?
[95:20.53]Watch that side.
[95:21.17]Wow, that was useless with me.
[95:22.67]They were, like, getting stuck on this defensor.
[95:26.25]How do you accidentally press G?
[95:27.55]Was it a good thing?
[95:28.09]Because H is close.
[95:29.19]Scout!
[95:34.24]Don't let him do it!
[95:36.22]Got no ammo.
[95:37.04]I got nowhere else to go.
[95:38.50]Help!
[95:39.60]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[95:44.42]Oh my gosh.
[95:45.58]Okay, we're good.
[95:46.72]Oh my god.
[95:51.07]Yeah!
[95:51.29]Can I get all the money too?
[95:53.97]Yes!
[95:54.89]A plus!
[95:56.39]I helped.
[95:57.45]Hey, well done everybody!
[95:59.21]Excellent job.
[96:01.64]Wait, how do you get the bonus?
[96:03.32]Oh, you get all the money.
[96:04.82]Oh yeah.
[96:08.46]Let's do this.
[96:09.12]Let's do a couple of those.
[96:10.14]What is that, reflector pyros?
[96:11.46]What is going on here?
[96:12.40]And spies?
[96:16.07]Two-way teleporter.
[96:16.73]Oh, you have to get the refill thing every round to one-time use.
[96:21.26]Let me try this again.
[96:22.46]Yep.
[96:23.96]R with rifle to use your charge buff on the sniper.
[96:26.78]Oh, right, right.
[96:27.44]Okay.
[96:28.06]Teleporter will take you both ways now if you want to go back.
[96:32.75]Full reload speed is probably broken.
[96:34.17]I don't know.
[96:35.73]Yeah.
[96:35.89]I'm ready.
[96:36.23]Okay.
[96:36.83]Hold on.
[96:42.90]Take your time.
[96:45.64]Get high ground so you're not shooting team.
[96:47.44]Problem with that, chat, is it's easier to shoot headshots down here.
[96:54.45]Who is this person?
[96:55.87]You look cool.
[96:57.23]Third century speed upgrade is bugged.
[96:59.91]I like your hat.
[97:01.41]Thank you.
[97:02.52]It's on brand.
[97:03.94]It is.
[97:04.30]Alright.
[97:06.97]Can you see?
[97:07.53]Oh, we got a big boy coming.
[97:10.46]I can see.
[97:11.24]Those medics only shoot those medics because they will just keep this heavy ubered for a full two to three minutes.
[97:17.84]If you headshot the heavy and you have the explosive headshots, you'll usually get the medics.
[97:23.07]That is so many medics.
[97:25.11]I'm going to bagel puss, bagel puss.
[97:27.25]Bagel puss!
[97:28.45]Yeah, just keep going.
[97:29.05]Alright, we got it.
[97:33.40]Nice.
[97:33.62]Eel.
[97:34.38]Eel, please.
[97:35.76]Who's grabbing that money?
[97:36.82]Yeah, yeah.
[97:37.22]Thank you.
[97:37.90]Yo, hit E in the future, and that'll show me.
[97:39.86]Oh, I forgot about that.
[97:42.14]There you go.
[97:42.42]He killed that so fast, the game's just not even ready to load the next enemy.
[97:48.33]I do love this doctor.
[97:51.83]Curious where he got his license from, but... More of a dugder.
[97:56.75]Same deal?
[97:57.37]Uh-oh.
[97:58.53]No, just headshot him.
[98:00.01]No one else shoot him.
[98:00.81]Just headshot him.
[98:03.04]Ludd, I don't need a license to plunge my crits into your bagel puss.
[98:05.90]This shot is all Vinny.
[98:08.70]Spies.
[98:10.46]Yep, spies are going- spies medic.
[98:15.42]Oh, I got spied re- I got- I got stabbed.
[98:18.14]Uh, we're gonna fucking die!
[98:20.41]Oh my god, this is spy medic just running around.
[98:25.55]That was- that was a problem.
[98:26.33]Get the fuck away from me!
[98:27.35]Yikes!
[98:28.71]Got 100 left, real close to death.
[98:30.71]He went all the way around!
[98:33.77]Okay, I'm fine.
[98:35.77]Medic, can I get a res?
[98:37.13]Whoa.
[98:37.51]Nope.
[98:39.33]I died.
[98:40.23]Chat, if I didn't get that shot, I would have been so disappointed.
[98:42.63]Oh, that was it.
[98:44.57]That was the round.
[98:47.37]Oh, there's no tank?
[98:48.13]Just that guy?
[98:50.04]Tank's next round.
[98:50.78]Yeah, tank is now.
[98:51.70]Oh, shit.
[98:52.48]Tank is now.
[99:00.58]Penetration, you think, chat?
[99:02.66]Yeah, penetrate him for sure.
[99:03.64]I got a lot of crits now.
[99:12.49]I have to go back and buy shit.
[99:13.89]What am I doing?
[99:17.01]What's your deal, man?
[99:18.23]Are you serious right now?
[99:22.21]Honestly, I just was like, oh, goodness.
[99:30.00]Max out explosive headshot.
[99:31.36]That'll be next.
[99:38.17]Okay.
[99:39.42]I got a second sentry now.
[99:40.54]That's fun.
[99:46.52]Explosive upgrade increases its range?
[99:48.44]That sounds awesome.
[99:50.25]Alright, they're going to be going pretty much both directions, so it doesn't matter.
[99:54.55]Okay.
[99:54.87]Ready?
[100:06.02]Someone said, what the fuck is wrong with his FOV?
[100:08.22]What's wrong with my FOV?
[100:13.57]I can't see your screen.
[100:14.43]If you want to change your FOV, you can do so.
[100:17.45]It's maxed out, chat.
[100:18.77]It should be, I think 90 is the max.
[100:21.42]Yeah, I maxed it out.
[100:22.88]Usually people, when they say your FOV, for some reason, they forget what FOV actually is and they're talking about your view model.
[100:30.26]Oh, yeah, view models.
[100:30.98]I have the weapons real small.
[100:32.66]If you're going to change your view model in the console, just make sure you do that off-camera.
[100:38.62]Like hitting Tildo, you know what I mean?
[100:40.54]Mm-hmm.
[100:45.92]You're sentry next to the dispenser, but then I can't do this one.
[100:48.51]Medic, are you okay?
[100:52.35]I see you in great distress, Doug.
[100:54.81]Just a little scared.
[100:56.79]I have a tank phobia.
[100:59.81]Can we destroy this tank right now for real, no cap?
[101:03.71]There are knights, demo knights.
[101:07.53]For real, no cappy.
[101:10.23]No cappy, Barra.
[101:12.57]Okay, now I'm going to get down.
[101:25.80]I want to use my crits.
[101:31.25]Ster, do you get overheal by picking up cash?
[101:34.98]Um, I think so?
[101:35.68]Or do I need to do that?
[101:36.32]Alright, because you always wrote overheal.
[101:38.92]I can't tell if I'm doing that or not.
[101:39.82]Yeah, I'm overhealed more than I should be able to, so I think you do, yeah.
[101:43.50]Okay.
[101:46.73]Ooh.
[101:48.95]Oh, shit.
[101:52.37]Oh, man, that was awesome.
[101:53.61]There's an arrow through my fucking head.
[102:10.62]God damn it.
[102:11.60]I had 40 fucking crits in that gun.
[102:13.68]I had I didn't know nobody even laughed at it.
[102:15.92]Oh shit Wait, what are we supposed to be laughing at nothing nevermind?
[102:21.01]I be coming.
[102:21.77]I be coming I Exhaled well sharply through my nose if that helps That's good
[102:32.62]Oh, I love this.
[102:33.52]Oh, God.
[102:34.62]I still have the bagel puss, dude.
[102:36.20]I don't know when to use it.
[102:36.84]We're just a well-oiled machine.
[102:38.30]Hold your bagel pussy.
[102:39.18]Dude, I'm so sorry.
[102:43.78]We have become such a synchronized unit that we're going to beat this in like 20 minutes.
[102:51.08]Are we capable of doing the real ones?
[102:52.86]Is this not a real one?
[102:57.49]This feels real to me.
[102:58.33]I don't know.
[102:58.63]There's a harder difficulty that's much harder.
[103:00.49]There is.
[103:01.78]What is this difficulty called?
[103:05.28]Bagel Pussy.
[103:06.96]There's an advanced and there's expert.
[103:08.66]I'd like to apologize for introducing that word into this game.
[103:11.60]That being said, I am going to pop it right now.
[103:21.74]Oh, big demo on the right.
[103:22.56]I got big guy.
[103:25.10]Nice.
[103:27.99]Very good.
[103:29.69]I'm just going to throw piss at the tank.
[103:34.06]I don't think it worked.
[103:41.10]Is it just tank left?
[103:42.32]I don't think I'm the most qualified to handle this tank as a sniper.
[103:45.56]Also, the dispenser, I upgraded the dispenser so there's a big trail on it now.
[103:50.05]I've never not had ammo.
[103:52.15]I think this might also be one of the easier maps because half the enemies have melee weapons.
[103:56.49]Alright, tank.
[103:57.33]What do you got?
[104:02.73]Alright, let the sniper handle it.
[104:03.94]Let the sniper handle it.
[104:06.44]Let's leave.
[104:07.92]The tank can't even carry the bomb.
[104:09.40]What's the risk of letting it through?
[104:10.62]It is a bomb.
[104:13.44]It is a giant bomb.
[104:18.33]A plus credit rating.
[104:19.29]Look at that.
[104:19.75]Wow.
[104:22.05]Damn.
[104:22.87]I think we're ready for hard mode.
[104:25.13]Yeah, to be honest, it's a bit of light work.
[104:29.18]True.
[104:29.76]They don't know how hard hard is.
[104:34.20]Oh, the real game strikes now.
[104:37.99]Two tanks this time?
[104:44.47]I believe it's two, yeah.
[104:45.97]Ooh, this metal regen.
[104:47.05]Are there crits in this one?
[104:48.29]Is this a crit one?
[104:50.17]These are punch holiday heavies, which if they punch you, you are going to just start laughing.
[104:58.72]You essentially just go... Oh, thanks for explaining what laughing is.
[105:07.21]I was unsure.
[105:07.93]Oh, fuck.
[105:09.73]You cleared it up for me.
[105:10.89]You cleared it up for me.
[105:12.57]I wasn't sure if it was like a ha-ha or a hee-hee.
[105:14.83]I went to go see a doctor for that once.
[105:16.24]He said it was just laughing.
[105:19.16]I laughed once and you had... Wait, you had to see a doctor after laughing?
[105:22.68]Yeah.
[105:23.44]I didn't know what it was.
[105:26.68]Sound off if you're ready.
[105:29.84]I mean, it's involuntary, so seeing a doctor was probably the right move.
[105:35.94]Are we ready to absolutely crush this?
[105:38.72]I'm ready.
[105:39.04]I'm feeling great about myself and my team.
[105:41.90]How do you like Soldier Call?
[105:47.47]So fun.
[105:48.67]Very fun.
[105:49.01]How do you like what you're doing?
[105:51.79]I love Engi.

[106:24.58]That's the only thing I heard.
[106:25.87]Dude, I always read these threads growing up.

[106:34.59]So good luck with that search.
[106:36.67]Just prepare to wipe your entire search history after that.
[106:40.35]Better yet, search on Bing.
[106:45.95]We got punch heavies.
[106:50.94]I'm trying to snipe a tank.
[106:54.40]Let me get the heavies.
[106:55.90]Tank is completely under control.
[106:57.98]Okay.

[107:37.68]It is currently in the oven.
[107:41.55]Oh, I understand.

[107:54.00]It's almost there, guys.
[107:54.92]It's almost there.
[107:55.39]It's like Comedy Central up in this piece.
[108:04.75]Because...
[108:07.18]Just a great round.
[108:08.30]Just a great round.
[108:09.06]That was great.
[108:09.46]Except somebody missed 25 bucks, but I just saw the money.
[108:11.17]It's right there.
[108:12.05]Damn.
[108:12.27]Oh, it was on under.
[108:13.75]That's sneaky.
[108:14.43]Just restart.
[108:15.85]Should we restart?
[108:35.00]Another wave, another dollar.
[108:36.08]I was thinking about we should probably just redo the whole thing.
[108:38.10]Should we start the stream?
[108:40.44]Hey, everybody.
[108:40.84]Welcome.
[108:42.24]What's going on, guys?
[108:43.50]Restart all of our streams.
[108:48.47]What's up?
[108:48.95]Who is not ready?
[108:55.43]Who is not ready to fight robots?
[108:57.56]What is that accent?
[108:58.76]A damn Jerm.
[109:00.70]The heavy is Russian.
[109:03.32]Ah.
[109:04.51]Can we get some more from some other people on the call?
[109:16.92]Not just a couple?
[109:21.52]I'm ready.
[109:25.06]I'm American.
[109:26.00]One of you did Christopher Walken and I don't know who.
[109:30.74]Astroglide.
[109:31.58]I think it was Doug Doug.
[109:39.04]So you didn't let them buy?
[109:40.54]Your Watto impression?
[109:42.30]They don't want to hear the Watto impression.
[109:43.98]I love the American one.
[109:45.86]No, I do.
[109:48.85]It's me, the heavy weapons guy.
[109:51.03]Do you want to buy a T29 hyperdrive?
[109:55.23]Damn.
[109:55.67]Good Watto.
[109:56.03]GTA server.
[110:00.15]That was very good, but I don't know who Watto is.
[110:02.97]You don't know who what?
[110:04.03]Then how do you know it's good?
[110:05.77]He's my favorite Star Wars character.
[110:08.25]I just liked it.
[110:09.11]I just liked it.
[110:10.09]What does Watto look like to you based on that voice?
[110:12.33]Like if you had to guess.
[110:14.73]One eye is purple because he's got a hit in the face and he's very, he's got like a mustache and a lot of like a five o'clock shadow.
[110:24.57]Someone in my chat, can you draw that?
[110:29.03]Peru, dude.
[110:29.89]So cringe.
[110:31.13]That's him.
[110:31.75]He's got it.
[110:33.13]Did I?
[110:37.27]I don't think that was even close.
[110:38.89]Wait, no, I think it kind of was.
[110:42.83]Wait, what is he from?
[110:43.91]I think Wado does have a mustache, but he's, you know, he's a flying alien.
[110:48.87]I think he does not have a mustache, does he?
[110:51.99]Wait, chat, does he have a mustache?
[110:54.07]No, I don't think so.
[110:56.35]He doesn't look like Danny DeVito and Matilda.
[111:00.32]I think that's what Star described.
[111:04.08]Yeah, Star, I think you saw Danny DeVito in Matilda, and that's why you, like, recently, right?
[111:10.22]Yesterday.
[111:10.74]You just can't get Matilda out of the brain.
[111:17.51]She's just like me.
[111:19.99]Did you know Danny DeVito directed that movie?
[111:22.99]No, really?
[111:23.85]Very talented guy.
[111:24.77]Directed or produced?
[111:26.79]I'm pretty sure he directed that.
[111:28.03]Yeah, that was a directorial movie for him.
[111:31.29]He's done a lot of stuff that you wouldn't think.
[111:38.60]We are absolutely destroying this.
[111:42.88]I'm going to hit you.
[111:45.27]I thought you were about to die.
[111:47.45]There you go.
[111:49.03]I'm feeling great.
[111:49.85]I'm feeling electric.
[111:54.19]I mean, we got to go to hard mode.
[111:55.53]This is a little too free for me.
[111:56.48]Six dollars somewhere?
[111:57.46]Spies.
[111:59.95]Spies are here.
[112:01.85]Nice.
[112:06.61]Oh, a spy killed me.
[112:07.43]Nice.
[112:10.35]This one's... Spy is... Spy's poke.
[112:12.37]Oops.
[112:16.05]I'm not here.
[112:16.96]Careful.
[112:19.56]Imagine playing a spy, a grown-ass man.
[112:23.16]Whoa.
[112:23.58]I used the focus the wrong time.
[112:25.00]God damn it.
[112:26.76]Grown-ass person playing a game.
[112:28.31]It's so funny because that's probably like the hardest, most meticulous class to play.
[112:33.25]You need like a certain level of adult intelligence, I think, to be able to do it.
[112:37.45]I just think saying grown-ass man is so funny.
[112:39.88]I've been saying it as much as I can lately.
[112:44.46]Imagine a grown-ass man doing that.
[112:50.94]Oh, a little bit of a shriek.
[112:54.71]Heavies are going around the left side.
[112:57.17]Yeah, seen him.
[112:58.37]We had the bomb, though.
[112:59.47]Yeah, seen it.
[113:02.03]Old news.
[113:07.00]They keep saying, here comes the spies, I haven't seen them, so someone's doing a great job on our team.
[113:11.76]Oh, shit!
[113:12.02]There's a bunch of heavies going behind.
[113:13.70]In the middle!
[113:14.80]Is that a spy?
[113:15.98]Holy shit, how many people?
[113:17.40]Oh, there's a lot back here.
[113:19.12]Is this person evil?
[113:20.38]I can crit you if we need.
[113:22.91]We're good.
[113:24.17]Are we alright?
[113:25.91]uh there's money somewhere money money where's the money on this side I got it I got some money here oh god uh take a bus enter down yeah hell yeah alright this is it this is the hard one who's missing the nine
[113:47.53]wow Ster I mean if if you're the engineer standing on the roof shooting its guys in a totally random spot and you don't say that money dropped over there I don't know to go get it it's fair imagine being a grown ass man saying something like that man talk about money uh I gotta do this I gotta do this alright a lot of blast a lot of blast
[114:16.03]What the blast?
[114:17.84]Any crits?
[114:18.42]Any critters?
[114:20.04]Yes.
[114:21.02]Any fire?
[114:22.30]No fire.
[114:23.16]Three tanks.
[114:24.32]Final wave.
[114:30.18]I think that's what I'm doing.
[114:30.92]I think we're pretty much ready to rock and roll.
[114:36.86]Grown ass team ready to bagel puss.
[114:39.92]Grown ass men talking about bagel pussies still.
[114:41.65]I was about to say that.
[114:44.67]Grown ass men.
[114:46.11]There's some grown ass men playing TF2.
[114:48.75]What's going on?
[114:49.19]Uh, this is what grown ass men are meant to do.
[114:52.51]Hold on, I'm not ready.
[114:53.49]I'm not ready.
[114:54.58]Well, I can't afford any other games.
[114:55.82]If your ass isn't grown, get the fuck out of here.
[114:57.84]Alright, now I'm ready.
[114:59.52]Grown ass.
[115:00.86]Easy.
[115:01.32]Grease.
[115:07.74]It's going to be like three tanks back to back to back.
[115:10.52]A lot of medics.
[115:12.60]Just make sure we know that.
[115:14.70]Okay.
[115:16.85]I'm ready.
[115:17.33]I don't know about the rest of the people on the team that press F4 when they're ready.
[115:23.01]I'm ready.
[115:23.93]Those fellows also are ready at this point, I believe.
[115:26.27]You're not blinking?
[115:27.21]When was the last time I blinked?
[115:29.65]Can you guys actually calculate that?
[115:33.53]Yeah, they have like a notebook.
[115:37.43]You write it down.
[115:38.85]Blink watchers, man.
[115:43.85]Why did you just... Oh, fall damage.
[115:45.33]I just heard you scream, Doug.
[115:46.35]Alright, Lud, you ready?
[115:50.83]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[115:52.81]It's always this air coots guy.
[115:59.60]Okay, time to clutch your kick.
[116:02.30]Can you imagine being a grown-ass coots?
[116:05.40]Don't, don't, don't be, come on.
[116:08.78]Uh, this, this is DPS that we didn't get on tank.
[116:10.54]If there's one second, we're gonna lose.
[116:13.88]If we lose, this was why.
[116:28.30]Hey.
[116:29.68]We're alright.
[116:34.28]This is hard to look at.
[116:36.68]Heavies going around.
[116:37.28]You're zooming in and out.
[116:37.92]None of them have the bomb, but they're right.
[116:41.96]Oh, no.
[116:42.80]Yeah, heavy's on the right.
[116:43.89]I'll try to get the heavies.
[116:47.05]Oh, you got them.
[116:49.43]Heavy is a spy.
[116:50.89]That spy is not one of us.
[116:52.41]That one of us is me.
[116:53.65]That me is a sniper.
[116:54.83]That sniper is a pyro.
[116:57.42]You talk like the guy in Disneyland on the Indiana ride.
[117:05.43]I do?
[117:05.71]Yeah, he gives you like the safety instructions on Indiana Jones.
[117:10.25]Oh, why did I come here?
[117:13.88]There you go.
[117:18.50]That's true.
[117:18.88]I was there recently.
[117:30.98]Wait, is this finally out or second line?
[117:33.18]Fucking boogers are coming out again.
[117:38.12]Somebody said that.
[117:43.89]We got a Disney adult?
[117:45.67]Yeah, no, they're wrong with that.
[117:46.99]I would say.
[117:48.39]Are we going to?
[117:48.87]You want to have this fight?
[117:50.87]We got two warriors right here.
[117:52.27]Let's go.
[117:52.67]High five.
[117:53.75]I make fun of Disney adults, and then they're like, you're a Nintendo adult.
[117:56.49]I'm like, you're right.
[117:57.49]Oh.
[117:59.29]Yeah.
[117:59.53]Disney loves this shit.
[118:00.46]This one's awesome.
[118:02.80]Behind the tank is two soldiers.
[118:04.36]We should get them.
[118:06.24]Yeah.
[118:06.42]Working on it.
[118:06.92]Working on it.
[118:11.48]This, like, shield in front of me, by the way, will stop the projectiles.
[118:13.73]That thing's amazing.
[118:15.63]Tank needs a little bit of work.
[118:17.47]Tank needs some, yeah.
[118:18.41]And I'm a sniper.
[118:19.47]I need help.
[118:21.27]I'm weak against tank, but I can shoot a bit.
[118:24.61]Tank is fine.
[118:26.35]Tank is good?
[118:27.53]Yeah, we're good.
[118:28.94]Oh, they got me laughing!
[118:34.16]Tank is still going.
[118:35.90]Got me feeling like a rockstar.
[118:37.00]I got it.
[118:37.48]I got the tank.
[118:40.76]I shouldn't have been that concerned.
[118:43.46]My money.
[118:44.24]Excuse me, guys?
[118:46.33]What's wrong?
[118:47.28]Oh, on the right side?
[118:48.80]Lots of heavies?
[118:49.40]Yeah, we got some heavies with boxing gloves.
[118:52.68]I'll watch the bomb.
[118:53.62]Oh, they're making me laugh.
[118:54.40]They got a laugh!
[118:55.18]That's what a laugh is!
[118:56.98]Oh yeah, if you don't know how it goes, it goes... Oh!
[119:00.38]Sniper's coming.
[119:06.92]Sentry buster!
[119:07.59]Oh, I'm the engineer!
[119:09.03]Oh shit!
[119:10.21]Pushing it back, pushing it back.
[119:13.33]Oh!
[119:15.25]Got it.
[119:15.77]We got it.
[119:16.15]We got it.
[119:16.51]Thank you, guys.
[119:17.09]Appreciate it.
[119:31.06]Oh, not even a factor right now.
[119:33.10]Not even a factor.
[119:35.08]Sniper on the right.
[119:39.62]Oh, we got a lot of big boys coming down.
[119:41.61]Okay.
[119:43.55]I need a sniper to get rid of these shields.
[119:45.85]Yeah, I need to back out.
[119:47.21]Okay, I can crit you.
[119:51.03]Go.
[119:54.06]Got it.
[119:54.62]We're good.
[119:55.90]Round two, round two.
[119:57.74]Going for the medics.
[119:58.70]Get them.
[119:59.04]Alright.
[120:01.78]Focus fire.
[120:04.08]These heals are insane.
[120:05.50]Wow, dude.
[120:07.06]What?
[120:09.29]I'm down, though, so...
[120:11.64]Buster.
[120:12.26]Uh-oh.
[120:13.16]I am about to... Ooh, nice job.
[120:16.48]That was a waste of fucking karate.
[120:21.85]Alright, we're getting collapsed on here.
[120:28.69]We're fine.
[120:29.09]Take time, and then we're done.
[120:30.95]That's it, yeah.
[120:32.62]That was free, I'm not going to lie.
[120:35.66]Shield's kind of good.
[120:37.28]Yeah, Doug's kind of crazy as a medic.
[120:44.40]Give me this buff.
[120:50.06]Whoa, sniper.
[120:50.82]We got some snipers on the map too.
[120:53.22]Oh, you got him.
[120:53.76]You got him.
[120:54.74]Damn, Ludwig's damage is crazy.
[121:00.35]Mental.
[121:01.45]Alright, we got somebody to get something cool.
[121:03.73]They're nuts.
[121:04.29]Alright, big old sword.
[121:07.25]Banana.
[121:08.09]Nice.
[121:09.13]What we getting here?
[121:09.69]What we get?
[121:10.07]Come on, no whammies for me.
[121:11.25]No whammies for me.
[121:12.29]Give me a jacket.
[121:15.16]Oh, yeah.
[121:16.10]Nice.
[121:16.46]That's my favorite weapon in the game.
[121:18.00]I don't think I got anything.
[121:19.10]Is that normal?
[121:20.12]You didn't get anything?
[121:20.66]You got a Thermal Thruster.
[121:22.34]Oh, wait.
[121:25.05]Because you have to complete the tour, and you've already done this apparently, I guess.
[121:31.91]Oh.
[121:32.64]Me too.
[121:33.38]I didn't get anything either.
[121:36.28]Shit.
[121:40.24]Yeah, my result screen is bugged.
[121:41.73]Why don't we just try the hardest mode?
[121:43.45]36-year-old man.
[121:45.07]Yeah, give us the hardest mode.
[121:46.43]I feel like it was a lot easier because we didn't lose $400 a round.
[121:51.15]But still, they made fun of me for losing $6.
[121:53.55]Almost 38-year-old man, by the way.
[121:57.68]People in chat, you don't even know how old I am.
[121:59.92]That's me and Jerma, both 38.
[122:03.58]We could send this comp at the hardest one they have.
[122:06.96]This comp is not losing to many.
[122:10.02]If any.
[122:11.85]I think we got what it takes to do the expert.
[122:14.83]Oh, boy.
[122:15.85]This guy thinks he can handle expert all of a sudden.
[122:20.49]Okay.
[122:21.89]Alright.
[122:22.37]I just want to make sure everyone in the call understands I'm trying to talk up the call.
[122:25.96]He's talking about how none of you can do it.
[122:31.32]I can do it.
[122:33.49]Oh, Botswana.
[122:34.53]See?
[122:36.81]I mean, I'm here to, I could do, I could do it.
[122:39.23]I could try it.
[122:40.15]Operation gear grinder warning.
[122:42.43]Expert missions are much harder in all caps.
[122:45.31]This is written in the game.
[122:46.89]Advanced missions require all 16 members to be strong contributors.
[122:52.29]So the fourth class is the Demoman and the Demoman has two primaries.
[122:56.57]He's got the rocket, the grenade launcher, and he's got the sticky launcher.
[123:00.35]This sounds like a mode for some grown ass men.
[123:02.41]Yeah.
[123:04.57]Queued up for man up.
[123:06.53]We are grown-ass man up.
[123:07.95]Bro, you look like Count Chocula.
[123:09.29]Ban that person for a fucking hour.
[123:13.73]Actually, no.
[123:14.49]Actually, don't ban that person.
[123:15.33]That's fucking cool.
[123:16.05]I'm into that.
[123:16.43]TF2 crashed for me.
[123:25.91]Oh, no.
[123:26.03]Never mind, it didn't.
[123:34.93]Sometimes the loading screen looks like a crash if you were tabbed.
[123:38.15]Yeah, I was tabbed.
[123:38.93]I'm playing GeoGuessr.
[123:41.01]We forget that you've never played TF2 and you don't know how buggy the game is.
[123:45.75]How old the code is.
[123:47.20]Alright, so what are our strengths?
[123:52.64]Take your picks.
[123:54.24]I'm a nasty little tank.
[123:55.66]I'm a dirty little tank.
[123:58.32]I can scout.
[124:00.34]I can stay scout.
[124:01.64]I can stay scout.
[124:03.64]Yeah, I'm fine going mad again.
[124:04.88]That was fun.
[124:05.60]I kind of want to do lock and load demo.
[124:07.74]Does that suck now?
[124:11.68]Or I could spy.
[124:15.18]I'll do sniper again if you guys think it's... My chat's like, I should do sniper.
[124:19.02]I think our last team comp was efficient, effective, and fierce.
[124:24.36]That's my thoughts.
[124:26.10]And then they end abruptly.
[124:28.37]Doing something a little goofy, but let's give it a try.
[124:31.55]Yeah, let's give it a shot.
[124:42.54]Bro, you are throwing right now.
[124:45.06]You don't know that.
[124:45.60]Okay, you know what?
[124:54.70]Turn off unscoping after shooting in the options.
[124:57.08]Might feel better.
[124:57.80]Huh.
[125:04.63]People are accusing me of being high right now.
[125:09.67]Excuse me.
[125:11.84]Yeah, excuse you.
[125:14.78]Any crits this round?
[125:16.84]Not this round.
[125:20.16]Maybe I just do... Chat, that's not what I need.
[125:28.73]It seems kind of good.
[125:35.70]Wait, can I use the cow thing now?
[125:39.91]still golfing the Cow Mangler yep it's fun so that that does not have any ammo you just have to recharge it it does take a little bit extra takes a little bit extra time to reload but it doesn't work with my guy yeah so that would only be on the soldier oh yeah I'm not soldier turn on damage numbers do you guys have your damage numbers on or no I see it yeah
[126:06.64]Wait, how do you see damage?
[126:08.28]It's in the, uh... I don't know, every time I shoot it goes and it shows me every little number.
[126:11.60]Classic TF2 videos.
[126:12.86]Holy shit.
[126:16.75]Ubercharged.
[126:19.17]Hybrid knight in MVM with an omeglel face.
[126:22.58]Well, you haven't seen it play out yet.
[126:24.70]This is a bad map.
[126:25.40]We should have done the other map.
[126:29.14]this is actually going to be really fucking hard it is going to be hard I want to pick a map that we already knew and there's only three missions on the hard one because they made this cool mode and then they never supported it after that ever again what I thought valve did that a lot there was mvm came out then like two years went by and then they added like emissions in one update but there's a whole bunch of community maps for this that are pretty cool and we all we all love it
[126:58.40]Add some roguelike elements to it and boom, there you go.
[127:01.22]Yeah, they could just call it TF 2.2.
[127:08.46]TF 2.5.
[127:11.79]TF 2.2 would be good.
[127:12.95]TF 2.3.
[127:15.93]Ooh.
[127:18.23]Wow.
[127:19.43]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[127:23.27]Dude, I got a DM from...
[127:26.27]I got a DM from Cody Ko, and he said I did the Billy Billy challenge, which I thought meant the NPC challenge because the streaming said Billy Billy.
[127:34.47]And then he said I threw up at the end, so he was trying to say the Doug Doug challenge, but he called it the Billy Billy challenge.
[127:42.53]Oh, that's your challenge, Doug?
[127:43.77]He threw up.
[127:46.51]It's my challenge in the sense that I did it first, I guess.
[127:49.70]And created it?
[127:51.45]Poking.
[127:52.47]It's so hard.
[127:53.31]Yeah, it's your challenge.
[127:54.89]It's your challenge in the sense that you created it, did it first, and popularized it.
[127:59.01]And made the rules.
[128:00.11]Outside of that, you don't have much ownership.
[128:02.02]Gotcha.
[128:03.72]Yeah, I wanted to do it.
[128:05.20]And I wanted to hire, like, three or four massive bodybuilders.
[128:11.16]And just go do it and pretend like I'm your best friend.
[128:13.44]Already spies.
[128:14.83]Already spies.
[128:16.74]Oh yeah, they're not messing around.
[128:18.61]Behind you, behind you.
[128:19.63]Just spin around, spin around.
[128:21.69]Oh, there's a spy behind me.
[128:23.53]No, there's a lot of them.
[128:25.71]What is going on?
[128:26.65]It's like 10 spies.
[128:29.03]Yeah, there's a lot of spies.
[128:30.77]It's the hard mode.
[128:32.13]How many spies are there?
[128:34.65]They insta-kill, dude.
[128:36.97]Wow, spy.
[128:38.12]Fuck off.
[128:39.86]Look at the top.
[128:41.94]And if you see the spy icon there, that means they're still spies.
[128:46.63]Oh, we don't have a teleporter.
[128:49.53]Oh, my God.
[128:51.75]So do we all waste $1?
[128:55.37]No, it only gets consumed when you lose.
[128:58.79]Like, no, no, no.
[128:59.57]When you win.
[129:00.15]Sorry.
[129:01.95]Oh, here we go.
[129:03.83]Finally.
[129:04.25]Okay.
[129:04.81]Long enough.
[129:06.33]Alright.
[129:06.57]Go, go, go.
[129:07.59]Oh, that's an Uber.
[129:08.31]Okay.
[129:12.65]Shit.
[129:15.17]What is happening?
[129:16.53]The heal guys.
[129:17.11]We gotta kill the heal guys.
[129:18.21]Uh oh.
[129:18.41]How the hell is that working, Jerma?
[129:29.48]Uh, these guys take extra melee damage.
[129:30.80]I forgot to say that.
[129:31.96]Because they have those built up.
[129:36.62]Oh, I do!
[129:37.20]That was me!
[129:37.69]That's why it was me!
[129:39.93]You piece of shit!
[129:43.11]Dammit.
[129:44.26]Dude, you got the double dunk.
[129:45.87]That's right.
[129:46.41]You're throwing.
[129:47.03]I'm fine.
[129:49.23]This is a terrible start.
[129:51.09]Sniper's focusing on us across the way.
[129:57.09]Oh, this is nasty.
[129:58.84]This is nasty.
[130:00.20]This guy's getting healed.
[130:01.68]We got to kill the healer.
[130:06.82]Trying to push the bomb back.
[130:07.82]Alright, we're okay.
[130:09.28]Can we just backstab him and kill it?
[130:10.68]One shot or no?
[130:14.31]Can you one-shot with Backstab?
[130:16.11]I don't know if you can do that.
[130:16.88]I'm going to crit this.
[130:17.52]Let's just wipe it.
[130:21.32]No, some things you can one-shot.
[130:22.72]Some things, like the big giant ones, I don't think you can.
[130:25.40]They just do a lot of damage to them.
[130:26.93]Jeez.
[130:28.99]I'm having a hard time on Spy.
[130:30.35]I got disoriented.
[130:38.16]Shit.
[130:39.00]Wait.
[130:41.00]Scout's coming in.
[130:41.62]Scout's here.
[130:42.76]Scout's here.
[130:44.34]We're okay.
[130:51.23]I'm a dead man.
[130:54.73]They're deep in our pussies.
[130:59.09]Oh, this is over.
[131:03.62]Okay.
[131:04.22]I am going to take the... I'm going to blame me.
[131:06.24]I'm going to blame me.
[131:07.96]I'm going to blame me.
[131:10.02]I did great.
[131:11.40]I don't blame Doug, and I don't blame Doug.
[131:15.75]I'm going to blame you.
[131:17.29]Let me not do bear charge.
[131:19.77]I think this is better.
[131:25.03]I'm going to go, Angie.
[131:26.95]Those spies are frustrating.
[131:28.91]I wonder if I should put on
[131:38.83]this thing.
[131:39.43]Use Huntsman with bleed arrows?
[131:43.06]Alright, I can do this.
[131:55.67]Should I not be sniper?
[131:57.55]Should I be like another class to help?
[131:59.11]What are you feeling?
[132:01.37]I don't know.
[132:02.83]Should I light them on fire?
[132:07.23]You should just turn around.
[132:09.29]iroh is every now and then I feel a little bit lonely and something out of something just turn that song on and every time it says turn around turn around would you go to a concert if they did that and they just kept getting higher and higher for an hour
[132:35.37]like a shepherd's tone it just keeps going who's playing up until the point it's a dog whistle well then that's a problem yeah this generation of like how cool we are we maybe you just go you film that song on your phone like as a selfie and then you leave after it's over oh that's the whole concert they don't do anything else

[132:59.92]Oh, that's it.
[133:00.58]Oh, then you're good.
[133:01.18]You get four hours of that.
[133:02.60]That's sick.
[133:03.04]They come out and they're like, we understand that this is the only thing anybody ever sings of our anything we ever have ever done.
[133:10.31]So we're just going to do this.
[133:12.41]And then they get really mad.

[135:15.21]Oh, shit.
[135:16.71]Aquatic movie?

[135:42.04]I'm going to crit you when they get close.
[135:43.32]I'm staying at the back.
[135:47.18]That was a little premature.
[135:54.68]Interesting play.
[135:55.68]Shit!

[137:35.25]It was stressful.
[137:36.75]It's pretty stressful.
[137:38.03]What did I need?
[137:39.15]Honestly, rage.
[137:41.26]Knockback rage would have helped.
[137:45.88]Maybe a little firing speed.
[137:47.32]How wrong that could have gone.
[137:50.84]We actually did fine.
[137:52.26]Yeah.
[137:54.73]That was wave one.
[137:58.79]That's what's stressing me out.
[138:00.03]It's about to get very stressful.
[138:05.67]Get bloody, Garen.
[138:10.11]Alright.
[138:15.61]Where do you guys want the dispenser?

[138:23.54]Somewhere on top of it?
[138:25.54]Where do you put it?
[138:26.04]Here's fine for me.
[138:27.46]It's probably safe here if you want to run back to it.
[138:31.08]Don't need the metal.
[138:33.16]There's a full ammo case up here.
[138:36.21]I'll be good I am rtg then you should put it here so your back can be to the metal and you're not getting shot you see what I'm saying if you if you say anything to this guy he just like shuts down I'm okay

[141:58.26]Uh, Sentry's coming.
[141:58.84]Hit him out of ammo.
[141:59.32]He's almost dead, though.
[141:59.96]Bring it on.
[142:05.69]You see the crate boxes up here?
[142:07.35]Or the medals up here.
[142:08.67]Spy is coming again.

[142:11.43]Oh, I hate you so much, but yeah, we did it.
[142:13.69]Oof.
[142:13.99]Good job.
[142:14.83]Nice.
[142:16.47]Not bad.
[142:16.95]We got most of the money.
[142:18.90]Jerma, where was your refill station?
[142:21.52]It was on the top right, but when it got kind of hairy, I just brought it back here.
[142:25.70]Oh, okay.
[142:26.18]But I will put it... I'm going to put it where the fence is the next time, where you were last time.
[142:29.52]Yeah, I like the fence.

[142:56.06]Yeah, it's definitely time to get some resist.
[142:58.26]So, blast resistance for sure here.
[143:01.68]Get one jump and jump on the sign.
[143:04.42]Literal god spot?
[143:07.18]What?
[143:07.94]Really?
[143:10.35]The red icon at the top means they're big ones, right?
[143:15.33]Like the three red?
[143:17.67]The three red I believe is crits.
[143:20.82]So those are crits.
[143:21.40]I thought crits was the blue.
[143:22.90]Okay.
[143:23.34]Oh, God.
[143:23.98]Oh, jeez.
[143:24.96]The blue outline is crits.
[143:26.24]The red is just big.
[143:28.84]Okay.
[143:29.12]And blue and red is big crits.
[143:32.22]Okay, hold on.
[143:32.66]I'm up.
[143:32.90]I gotta get up here.
[143:36.34]So I'm gonna put this... This is gonna have a pretty big range.
[143:38.89]You'll be able to see how far is it.
[143:41.95]Yeah, it's... You can stay pretty far away from it.
[143:50.60]It's stuck in my head now.
[143:57.56]Somebody said, where are your eyebrows?
[144:02.99]They're right here.
[144:03.71]I have a big brow bone and it's summertime, so I absorb the rays into my eyebrows and my hair lightens.
[144:12.37]Yeah, that's normal.
[144:19.11]summer brow bone sounds like a good like album name I think Douglas brow bone alright let's have some fun
[144:50.78]Soldier's coming in.
[144:52.10]Yeah, I'll probably create you for this.
[144:54.86]Alright, let's just kill him.
[144:59.65]Uh, yeah, Crypt tank behind you.
[145:01.41]Behind you.
[145:03.85]Okay.
[145:04.99]I'm trying to help.
[145:07.93]The tank, we gotta crypt the tank.
[145:10.55]That guy is not aware.
[145:11.57]Guy's tank.
[145:13.94]I can handle the soldiers back here.
[145:15.46]You guys focus on tank.
[145:20.69]Oh, I muted in call.
[145:21.69]Give me this crit.
[145:26.77]Big heavy coming up.
[145:28.03]Big heavy took out everything.
[145:30.37]I'm going to crit you again.
[145:32.57]Do you have ammo?
[145:34.17]Yeah, I'm using this shotgun.
[145:36.49]I think it does a little more.
[145:37.19]No, no, no.
[145:38.41]Your crit will do more.
[145:39.19]Get out your man again.
[145:40.59]I'll swap out.
[145:41.09]Yeah, yeah.
[145:41.63]You want to crit?
[145:42.85]Got the big lad.
[145:44.50]We might need help with the tank.
[145:45.92]There's a chance we might need help with the tank.
[145:50.55]I think we're okay.
[145:51.17]I have two crits that I can pop if we need it.
[145:53.51]Doug, I might need a heal.
[145:55.09]Where are you?
[145:55.61]My gun is just not made for this device.
[145:57.73]Oh, there we are.
[145:58.07]Yeah, I got you.
[146:00.27]Oh, God.
[146:00.67]I'm good.
[146:00.99]I'm good.
[146:01.21]I'm good.
[146:01.39]I'm good.
[146:02.27]Yeah, I'm not doing damage against that fucking tank.
[146:04.35]Do we have a pyro?
[146:08.59]I think I'll get crit just in time for this.
[146:12.15]We got to shoot this tank, damn it.
[146:14.54]We should be okay.
[146:16.44]Oh, thank God.
[146:17.82]Nice job.
[146:18.40]Whoa, that is... Whoa, big heavy.
[146:20.92]Big heavy on the left, right side.
[146:23.24]Yeah, big heavy with full health.
[146:24.54]I got rage.
[146:25.01]I have crit for it.
[146:27.17]I can push him back.
[146:31.17]I'm taunting him.
[146:32.29]Oh, wait, what?
[146:33.35]Oh.
[146:36.89]There's no way we lose this guy.
[146:40.97]Fuck, he got me.
[146:42.95]Holy shit, where did I die?
[146:44.70]Oh, I died.
[146:45.40]Oh, no.
[146:46.69]Oh, there's another heavy.
[146:48.10]It's okay.
[146:48.40]It's okay.
[146:48.66]It's okay.
[146:49.00]It's okay.
[146:49.30]It's okay.
[146:51.40]Left heavy.
[146:51.86]Left heavy.
[146:52.28]Focus it.
[146:52.68]Heavy versus heavy.
[146:54.24]That's too much respawn time.
[146:57.25]This heavy needs to be killed.
[147:00.09]I think we're alright.
[147:01.41]You might die.
[147:01.91]I'll try to get like half behind the staircase.
[147:05.35]I died.
[147:05.73]It killed me.
[147:06.31]Oh, thank God.
[147:08.17]Good job, guys.
[147:09.03]And I need you now more than ever.
[147:12.69]Alright.
[147:14.47]That was tough.
[147:16.13]I think knockback rage is decent.
[147:18.02]Easy.
[147:27.06]Maybe I do this.
[147:31.51]and then this no shit do I really even need the metal yeah I do but I need defense four tanks you guys the heavy is usually the best at shooting it while crits just throwing it out there I don't I don't want to be that guy look I do shoot it and then my chat my chat just my chat roasts me okay so I'm just sitting here my chat goes you your your guns literally resisted against it you shouldn't be using that
[147:59.24]So I'll endure.
[148:01.06]If what you're asking for me is to endure this punishment of being made fun of for using a gun that's not very effective, I will.
[148:10.18]I think you're doing just fine.
[148:11.38]I think you're doing good.
[148:12.60]Yeah, you are.
[148:13.12]I'm going to change my position.
[148:17.14]I'm going to go up here.
[148:17.82]You just got to use goon tactics.
[148:20.44]I'm gooning literally while live and they just go, heavy does reduce damage to tanks.
[148:23.97]Why are you shooting it?
[148:24.57]Ridiculous.
[148:24.89]Ridiculous.
[148:25.33]Isn't it stupid to put this here?
[148:26.97]Reduce damage is still more damage than it would be if you didn't shoot it.
[148:30.93]Yeah, we need all the damage we can get.
[148:36.33]Wait, should I crit somebody else then when we're attacking tanks?
[148:42.53]I think you still crit the goat.
[148:46.25]I mean, you were shotgunning it for a full minute or so.
[148:49.59]Shotguns without crit do like a quick thousand.
[148:52.87]They're pretty good.
[148:53.95]Alright.
[148:57.19]I am prepared.
[149:00.87]Isn't it weird how it's always Doug?
[149:03.67]It was me this time.
[149:05.05]Doug's a thinker.
[149:06.69]It was me this time.
[149:07.21]We got this.

[152:16.52]I don't know what to say.
[152:19.48]How do we do this shoot backwards fly thing?
[152:21.31]Because it's not working for me.

[152:48.10]and some I do a little you do a little blasting a little snipers are coming in maybe hey fellas it's me prospector of the way I think I got a good comp here
[153:11.20]This is as good as it's gonna get for me.
[153:12.24]Doug, I was watching your stream, Doug, and I saw you raid, and now I'm seeing Parkster with, Doug, please stop feeding.
[153:18.99]Yeah, there's a little side battle going on here.
[153:24.23]Yeah, I'm noticing, and I feel like you're losing both, arguably.
[153:29.81]Do you know you can just raid people while streaming as many times as you want?
[153:34.52]No!
[153:35.44]Yeah!
[153:35.98]You can just straight up raid.
[153:36.72]Where do they go?
[153:37.72]Where do they go?
[153:38.51]Alright, where do you- It's like two Christmases.
[153:41.05]It's like a divorce of parents.
[153:42.43]I'm gonna send some beers over to Vinny.
[153:43.45]I'm doing alright.
[153:44.21]I'm doing alright.
[153:45.15]Wait, so if I raid somebody here, they'll all go that way?
[153:48.74]If you raid them, it'll put them in the chat, but then you're still live, so then some come back, and then you can raid again.
[153:54.02]Right.
[153:54.46]You just lose all your viewers, but it's funny.
[153:56.50]Alright, who am I raiding?
[153:57.38]Who am I raiding right now?
[153:59.08]Oh, my chat member said you multiply the viewers.
[154:01.52]It creates new people from scratch.
[154:03.10]Can we just all raid Vinny at the same time?
[154:06.10]Let's give Vinny like 80,000 concurrent viewers.
[154:09.24]Yeah, I'm down.
[154:10.13]That makes me nervous.
[154:11.41]That actually makes me nervous.
[154:12.91]I'm raiding.
[154:13.57]Oh, shit.
[154:14.75]It's all over, Vinny.
[154:15.73]Wait, are we doing this?
[154:17.05]What are we doing?
[154:18.89]Let's do this instead.
[154:21.39]Not in this car.
[154:22.27]Oh, shit.
[154:22.67]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[154:23.35]I don't have the ability.
[154:25.18]I can't move.
[154:25.82]EDM!
[154:26.60]That's bad for us.
[154:27.44]Next round, we need to do that to somebody.
[154:29.50]That's so funny.
[154:35.72]Who wants to have, like, a shitload of viewers?
[154:40.77]I mean, listen, I say I'm nervous about it, but I wouldn't, like, downright refuse it.
[154:45.41]Well, you'd have to send them back to somebody else, though, in the call.
[154:48.29]I could do that.
[154:48.77]What's cool is, like, we don't need to get your permission.
[154:51.91]Okay, so here's how we're going to do this.
[154:53.45]So we'll all... Who wants to do the take of the first one?
[154:57.66]I'm confused.
[154:58.10]I'll take the first one, and then I'll pass it down to Ster.
[155:00.48]Okay, so at the end of this round, everybody's going to raid Vinny.
[155:04.57]But Lud, you're on YouTube, right?
[155:06.27]Yeah, this doesn't work for me.
[155:07.79]Okay.
[155:08.07]But I will laugh.
[155:10.85]That's fine.
[155:11.61]So we're just going to cycle.
[155:12.85]We need you to laugh in the background if that's cool.
[155:15.33]Yeah, we definitely need you, like, tackling in the background.
[155:18.13]Oh, I'm going to crit you once everybody's down on the ground.
[155:20.14]Alright, go.
[155:25.25]Damn, these guys sped up.
[155:26.63]Yeah, there was a moment I thought it was lag.
[155:28.95]Sniper on the back right.
[155:30.31]Multiple, if anybody can get him.
[155:31.73]My screen went sepia tone.
[155:37.60]Yeah, I think there's piss snipers.
[155:39.94]Yeah, you're covered in piss.
[155:43.07]Where was that?
[155:44.59]Where's your thing this time, Jeremiah?
[155:46.11]Up top here, where I am up here.
[155:47.25]Oh, it's with you, okay.
[155:51.84]It's a streamer Illuminati thing.
[155:53.30]I don't know what's going on.
[155:54.50]I think I missed the memo.
[155:56.34]It's going to be a very funny spot.
[156:09.29]Money.
[156:11.01]Getting pissed on a bit.
[156:13.43]Trying to prevent us from getting pissed on little tough targeting left guy.
[156:20.02]What?
[156:20.44]Head shield up.
[156:22.72]Targeting right guy.
[156:24.36]Good.

[156:28.04]Where is it?
[156:33.88]Come on.
[156:34.04]It's getting a little laggy.
[156:36.25]Yeah, this is lagging.
[156:38.27]Bomb coming up.
[156:38.77]That was good.
[156:47.47]I'm back.
[156:50.47]Okay.
[156:50.77]They don't even stand a chance.
[156:59.19]Oh, my God.

[157:43.43]Is this the hardest?
[157:43.99]This is literally the hardest difficulty.
[157:45.67]Fast scout.
[157:46.27]Very fast scout at very full health.
[157:48.13]He's already back.
[157:49.13]He's already back there.
[157:50.39]We slowed him down with piss.
[157:51.77]Now's your chance.
[157:52.29]Oh, that was so clutch.
[157:53.13]Good hit.
[157:53.55]Actually clutch.
[157:54.05]Almost threw the... I used the shotgun because I thought it'd be cool and he ran right by me.
[158:00.36]I need to do this.
[158:02.02]That's why I bought it.
[158:04.32]I'm going to leave a mini sentry back here in case of... What is left?
[158:11.95]A few lone snipers running through.
[158:13.35]There wasn't getting any lighter.
[158:17.59]Appreciate it, doc.
[158:21.51]Oh, what's happening?
[158:22.53]What is this?
[158:24.53]Yeah, what happened here?
[158:27.03]Making me nervous.
[158:27.91]Oh, they're there.
[158:30.26]Oh, there's no way we can handle this wave.
[158:39.34]We got all the money.
[158:41.43]Yeah.
[158:42.93]Oh, big scout on left.
[158:43.91]How come everybody's doing the leg phase?
[158:49.29]Ludwig, if we lose because you... Okay.
[158:59.94]Nice.
[159:01.12]Good catch.
[159:01.64]And I need you more than ever.
[159:04.30]A+.
[159:04.48]That was a... That was a cheap round.
[159:07.70]They didn't give us much for that.
[159:09.20]Yeah.
[159:10.50]Nice.
[159:11.93]Alright.
[159:13.18]Alright, uh, everybody raid Vinny.
[159:17.40]I don't understand.
[159:18.08]So we're gonna put, we're gonna conglomerate all of our viewers into one stream, and then that stream, we'll just pass it to the next stream, and we'll continue this forever until we all have 100,000 viewers.
[159:28.87]We're gonna, like, break all of our max viewer records.
[159:33.27]We're gonna materialize viewers.
[159:35.73]Yeah.
[159:36.97]Alright, ready?
[159:37.71]Who's first?
[159:38.41]It's just Vinesauce, yeah.
[159:39.79]And then who's after me?
[159:41.70]Stirr?
[159:42.60]I think Stirr should be after.
[159:44.20]Everybody get in the car.
[159:45.02]You're going to Uncle Vinesauce's house.
[159:46.46]Alright, everybody go to Vinesauce's house.
[159:47.90]Hold on, I'm waiting.
[159:48.44]This is very interesting.
[159:50.96]Let's see how- I'm also doing it.
[159:52.74]Yeah, but your stream is still on.
[159:55.12]You're still streaming.
[159:55.76]Alright, I've sent him.
[159:57.72]Oh my god.
[159:59.10]Are we good?
[159:59.50]Okay, so I'm raiding Vinesauce?
[160:01.68]Yeah.
[160:03.02]Uh... Alright guys, I'm raiding Vinesauce.
[160:07.30]Oh my fucking god.

[160:12.64]Uh, coming in soon?
[160:13.88]Coming in clutch with my gaming lifestyle?
[160:15.44]Okay, but here's... Is this the last round?
[160:18.78]I don't know, is it?
[160:19.78]So at the end of this round, you have to pass it to somebody else.
[160:22.54]I was gonna pass it, like, right away.
[160:24.20]Or should I do it, like, after the round?
[160:25.80]What are you... Yeah, we're doing a round.
[160:28.33]Because I'm not sure how much longer we're gonna be playing this.
[160:31.07]What round are we in right now?
[160:34.65]Five?
[160:34.99]Six?
[160:35.27]I don't know.
[160:37.67]Six out of seven.
[160:39.15]What we could do is we just keep passing the viewers along up until the round actually starts, and then that person just has to deal with them during the actual game.
[160:45.62]Or how about just at some point, after, like, a minute or two, just pass it.
[160:51.72]during the game.
[160:52.18]I'll just pass it in like a minute.
[160:53.49]I hit a new record.
[160:54.57]You just got me to 25k.
[160:55.49]I think like 15 was my record or something like that.
[161:00.39]So thanks everyone.
[161:02.49]Holy shit.
[161:05.05]Oh, you just got to 30k.

[162:46.13]I was gonna say, you're gonna run ten minutes of ads.
[162:50.09]Okay, my raid button is actually laggy because of how fucked up my stream is right now.
[162:54.30]By the way, start it.
[162:55.08]Yeah, and by the way, you guys are gonna be trapped over with Ster with like five minutes of ads.
[163:02.89]I'm I can't even like I don't feel like I should do that when I guess I'm the who is like Whose stream is visible right now to people all of everybody?

[164:41.69]Thanks for following.
[164:43.53]Scout.
[164:43.89]Scout.
[164:44.15]Scout.
[164:44.45]Scout.
[164:44.93]Scout.
[164:45.61]You got everybody.
[164:46.73]I got everyone.
[164:47.43]I'm going to double it and pass it on.
[164:51.73]So wait, so that means you need to get to like 70,000 viewers.
[164:54.50]Yeah.
[164:55.70]Okay.
[164:56.56]How?
[164:57.06]We can, if we just keep raiding, we'll keep creating viewers.
[164:59.64]I know it's going to help.
[165:00.29]You're going to help pop behind.
[165:01.79]I'm trying to play the game.
[165:02.93]Medic!
[165:03.35]You guys are cheating.
[165:04.79]We're going to get killed here.
[165:06.37]Hit him, hit him.
[165:10.28]He's taking the bomb!
[165:11.46]We had to kill the healer!
[165:15.30]Oh, what the heck?
[165:16.58]The healer!
[165:17.38]The medic benefits from the quick-fix uber as well, so the medic is also crazy healing and hard to kill.
[165:23.12]Did the raid even go through?
[165:27.07]Can I get your, uh... How you say, uh... Reload ammo thing?
[165:33.55]Yes.
[165:34.89]Dispenser.
[165:37.62]This team got crits.
[165:39.09]What the fuck happened to my view count?
[165:41.23]It says you're already raiding.
[165:43.07]I fell off, guys.
[165:44.41]What the fuck?
[165:45.19]I thought I was... Where'd the viewers go?
[165:48.77]It literally says you are already raiding, sir, and it won't let me raid, sir, again.
[165:52.56]Aw, let me investigate what's going on with my stream.
[165:54.44]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[165:55.34]They've... Vinny, they came from your... They're here now.
[165:59.94]Huh?
[166:00.30]I just got, like, an achievement.
[166:02.44]Level three.
[166:03.34]Level three what?
[166:05.29]Level 3 on Twitch?
[166:06.81]I think they sent him back to me.
[166:08.88]Why is there a hype train?
[166:09.88]I turned... Oh wait, what's going on?
[166:11.88]I got sent to Sturz, so... Oh.
[166:15.80]Oh, right.
[166:16.42]Because we're in a different chat room.
[166:21.57]It looks like the raid went through and we broke Twitch.
[166:25.25]Like, on my raid button, there's double of everybody.
[166:30.66]Here, I'll go ahead and raid Ster again just to be safe.
[166:33.19]Just to be safe, let's raid Ster again.
[166:35.81]Because we've created enough people, I think we're ready for another round of sending them.
[166:39.97]Wait, did I just type in Ster's chat, raid Ster?
[166:43.31]What happens then?
[166:43.87]I don't think anything will happen.
[166:48.37]It still says I have 31,000 viewers, which is insane.
[166:52.14]And I raided, so I don't know why this is happening.
[166:55.48]Okay, so we've created like 40 or 50,000 people.
[166:57.30]Yeah.
[167:00.09]Oh, 8k now.
[167:00.85]It went back down.
[167:01.59]Ster, you should just raid mine back.
[167:03.39]No, no, no, it's good.
[167:05.19]I got everybody.
[167:06.15]I'm down to 8k.
[167:08.11]Ster got everybody.
[167:09.28]So now Ster has to pass it on, I think.
[167:14.10]Are you here?
[167:15.74]Yeah, I think I was muted.
[167:17.02]It says 10,000 for me.
[167:18.16]Whenever I'm refreshing the Twitch directory, all the...
[167:22.46]numbers we have 21k now I think we're are we deleting viewers I think we're yeah I think we just started deleting people I think jeff bezos like shot up out of bed cold sweat was like god damn it they're sharing viewers around like that how dare they yeah looking at the the the TF2 directory I think we just deleted people oh
[167:47.82]I think Twitch just doesn't know how to update this, because I'm seeing 30 on Vinny and 20 unused, Eric.
[167:54.22]I'm raiding poke.
[167:55.09]You going poke?
[167:56.13]Why?
[167:56.35]I don't even have a fucking entrance.
[167:58.77]I'm sorry, guys.
[168:00.19]Who am I raiding?
[168:02.09]I'm raiding you.
[168:02.47]Some viewers got lost in the void.
[168:04.43]They got lost in a tub.
[168:06.01]It's working, even though I think I was already raiding Vinny.
[168:08.88]Yeah, we're getting weird diminishing returns from doing this.
[168:12.38]Yeah, this wasn't... Well...
[168:14.71]I think I did alright for myself, so thanks, everybody.
[168:17.13]You really got me a lot of followers.
[168:19.11]I appreciate it.
[168:21.25]Oh, fuck.
[168:24.23]Do I need to crit this?
[168:25.37]I guess I need to crit this.
[168:29.39]Hey, everybody.
[168:29.91]Welcome to the channel.
[168:33.79]What are we playing, Pope?
[168:35.77]We're playing TF2 with my best friends, guys.
[168:38.93]We just met tonight, gamers.
[168:40.93]We're best friends already.
[168:43.26]Why is the healer not getting hurt?
[168:45.62]Because he has the Quick-Fix uber.
[168:48.54]I love how... Blood, you are like very much... You're playing?
[168:53.45]We're like playing a goofy, funny, hot potato game over here.
[168:56.41]And you're like, kill the healer.
[168:58.45]I can't even fucking do it because I got YouTube.
[169:01.03]I'm just trying to get through the damn round.
[169:04.00]Like a hardworking American.
[169:06.30]Are you playing sad music or something?
[169:08.84]Oh, I just got my upgrades.
[169:10.40]Oh, shit.
[169:11.10]That's not good.
[169:11.76]Uh...
[169:14.42]Scouts, big scouts coming in right side.
[169:16.24]Big scouts coming in right side.
[169:18.98]We have a sniper, right?
[169:22.14]We can just react to you.
[169:24.02]Am I muted?
[169:26.65]Sniper, scout is here.
[169:28.31]Scout is here with the bomb.
[169:29.85]The bomb is on the medic.
[169:33.49]Soldier to your left.
[169:35.11]Okay.
[169:36.97]Hey, Pogue, somebody got raided.
[169:40.09]It came from my channel to Stura, then to Vinny, then to you, and they called me an idiot.
[169:46.81]Can you ban that person?
[169:47.91]I'm not a fan of what they said.
[169:49.59]They called me stupid in your chat.
[169:50.79]Can you ban them in there for me?
[169:53.71]Yes.
[169:54.13]This bit totally threw everything off.
[169:56.35]I'm so confused.
[169:58.64]We were going to beat it on the hardest mode.
[170:03.00]Alright, so where is everybody now?
[170:05.78]I think they're here, but I'm ready to raid.
[170:07.96]Oh yeah, I see them on pokes.
[170:12.68]Alright, so where have we not gone?
[170:16.82]Come to Papa.
[170:18.36]Yeah, back to DougDoug.
[170:19.18]Yeah, we gotta circle it back to Doug.
[170:22.76]Alright.
[170:23.92]Raiding DougDoug.
[170:27.60]Fantastic stream today, guys.
[170:29.14]Thanks for stopping by.
[170:30.42]Raiding DougDoug now.
[170:32.88]Vinny, you have half the viewers you had before the raid.
[170:40.79]That's so fucking funny.
[170:41.73]Wait, I'm trying to rate this, it's only a thousand.
[170:46.33]We broke something.
[170:47.55]No, it's broken.
[170:48.55]It's broken.
[170:49.57]Alright, everybody return to your respective channels of choice.
[170:55.69]Go home, guys.
[170:56.36]Everybody go home.
[170:59.23]Go back to where you came from.
[171:00.59]Leave.
[171:01.69]Flight.
[171:03.14]Everybody go back to where they started.
[171:04.80]And guess what?
[171:05.34]Reduce the atoms.
[171:06.86]I would say 30-40% did not think this was humorous at all, and they went to go watch somebody else.
[171:12.38]Yeah, they're watching, like... We just broke someone's Samsung TV.
[171:16.56]Yeah, they're sitting there trying to press the button on their remote, like, what the fuck did they do?
[171:22.95]Wait, this is a Sunday.
[171:23.89]There's some Twitch engineer on call who just got an alert and had to, like, get to his desk to fix this.
[171:31.87]I can't believe... And his name was Albert Einstein.
[171:35.45]Also, too, this is kind of weird.
[171:37.95]I started with 70 or 80 thousand viewers.
[171:40.27]Uh, this is... Something's wrong here.
[171:42.53]I'm down at... I don't know if anybody else is seeing that.
[171:46.82]You hit 70 thousand people tonight?
[171:48.98]Thank you for the raid, man.
[171:50.20]I appreciate it.
[171:51.96]Did it work?
[171:52.88]I got 1,600 people from you, but nobody else.
[171:56.24]Wait, you only got 1,600?
[171:57.00]Wait, did it work?
[171:59.90]I mean, a couple of them came over.
[172:03.31]Okay, I'll try again.
[172:06.17]I'll do it again, yeah.
[172:09.73]You only got like... It was like Home Alone.
[172:12.45]You left a bunch of them behind.
[172:13.83]I'm doing a raid and it says 600 people now.
[172:17.81]What's happening?
[172:18.45]This is so fucked.
[172:21.43]Bro, I got nothing left after this.
[172:23.14]I don't even have a chat anymore.
[172:25.90]It gave me an alert that it was 1,600, but it sent me 16,000.
[172:28.44]This is now my new viewership record.
[172:30.82]Thanks, everybody.
[172:31.44]Oh, my chat's gone.
[172:32.48]Hold on.
[172:33.63]Man, you guys really like TF2.
[172:35.23]Look at the directory right now.
[172:37.11]We're all up.
[172:38.76]We're all doing so well.
[172:40.26]You know what?
[172:40.62]We can all use that max number thing to get sponsorships.
[172:45.72]I don't do them, but you guys can.
[172:47.90]Be like, yo, look at the max numbers.
[172:50.16]We're all, like, fucking diesel streamers.
[172:52.40]We can get, like, the sickest promotions from, like, HelloFresh or PoxDash or whatever.
[172:56.27]Wow, I'm an ad guy.
[172:57.61]I believe the highest is what he'll have all the time.
[173:00.05]Guys, my number isn't going down, and I feel weird.
[173:02.77]What do I do now?
[173:03.81]Just restart the stream?
[173:06.05]Shit your pants.
[173:08.15]Shit yourself.
[173:08.99]Jeremy, where's your thing at?
[173:10.57]Check out this new product.
[173:11.41]Shit your pants crate.
[173:12.15]It's up here.
[173:13.50]I'm bringing it back to you.
[173:14.56]You can keep it there if you want.
[173:17.34]Real quick, what do we actually do with this heavy medic combo?
[173:20.22]I'm sorry, I was the medic first, I think.
[173:22.30]Headshot the medic, like full burst damage the medic.
[173:26.02]Sorry, I was raiding poke.
[173:27.04]I forgot.
[173:27.54]Jerma, why?
[173:31.18]Jerma, I was kidding.
[173:32.38]I didn't fall off.
[173:33.06]I was joking.
[173:35.64]Because the medic is also healing at like 10 times speed.
[173:40.22]Don't worry, Jerma.
[173:41.16]I'll help you refill your ranks.
[173:43.32]I don't know if I'm streaming.
[173:45.10]I don't know if you guys can hear me.
[173:46.62]I keep checking to see if I'm muted.
[173:48.62]I don't know what's happening.
[173:49.90]I don't know what is happening.
[173:50.86]I think Spirit might be muted.
[173:52.08]I haven't heard him in a while.
[173:53.73]Yeah.
[173:57.77]He ubered!
[174:01.03]Medic!
[174:01.39]Get the medic!
[174:01.81]Get the medic!
[174:02.19]Get the medic!
[174:02.55]We only have time.
[174:03.69]He ubered.
[174:04.19]He ubered.
[174:04.63]I'm trying, but the medic just keeps healing.
[174:08.59]Sorry, fall back.
[174:09.13]Fall back to the last point.
[174:09.87]Fall back to the last point.
[174:10.54]We're good.
[174:12.62]Everybody fall back to the last point.
[174:15.56]We're gonna get it right here.
[174:17.94]I'm raging him backwards.
[174:20.27]I rage him the wrong way.
[174:21.43]Can you fire this guy?
[174:23.87]Oh my god.
[174:25.25]Okay, good shit.
[174:27.03]I'm gonna create you.
[174:27.47]I'm gonna create you.
[174:27.93]Go, go, go.
[174:31.68]Scout, big scout, big scout.
[174:33.34]Yes!
[174:33.84]Big scout is dead.
[174:34.94]Nice job.
[174:36.23]Alright, alright, that was a lot better.
[174:37.81]Wait, eight, eight, eight monies.
[174:38.87]Eight bucks?
[174:40.35]Alright, everybody, go say hi to Uncle Jerma for me.
[174:44.59]Okay, I don't know what is happening, what is happening?
[174:48.28]Jerma, why'd you raid me again?
[174:52.08]It must have been a glitch from earlier.
[174:55.69]Alright, everybody, we're gonna raid Gemma here.
[174:57.64]And I need you more than ever.
[175:00.44]Alright, now let's see where everybody ends up.
[175:02.84]Will everybody stop?
[175:03.60]Yeah, after you guys raid me, we'll, like, we'll stop.
[175:06.80]And we'll, you know, from here, we'll... Why don't we do one last... Any crits?
[175:10.71]Any crits here?
[175:11.35]Any crits here, coaches?
[175:12.79]Uh, nope.
[175:13.65]We're good.
[175:14.53]What do you mean, any crits here?
[175:15.17]Where do we find the most random person and raid them?
[175:17.85]They're like, do I need crit armor?
[175:18.99]Can we just dump 50k on them?
[175:20.30]Oh, no.
[175:20.72]We need crits, because there's six tanks.
[175:23.77]Yeah, we need crits, but we are not worried about being attacked by crits.
[175:31.68]Let me just open my chat back up because I haven't seen it in like 20 minutes.
[175:38.88]I'm feeling very prepared for this one.
[175:41.36]I'm thinking it's a dub.
[175:43.80]Is this final round?
[175:44.50]Yeah, it's final round, right?
[175:46.45]Wave 7 to 7?
[175:47.45]I think this is it, yeah.
[175:49.07]This is the big one.
[175:51.64]Buy crit for you.
[175:52.64]Ooh, maybe I should buy crit for me.
[175:56.46]Well, I made it ammo.
[175:58.14]Ammo's, like, what I always run out of.
[175:59.91]Everyone get crit canteens.
[176:01.01]And if, like, halfway through the mission, you die, buy crit canteens again.
[176:05.11]Okay.
[176:05.85]If you, like, have money and you're in spawn.
[176:08.23]Copy.
[176:08.93]Where the fuck is my entrance?
[176:10.18]Oh, there it is.
[176:11.80]Someone came into my chat and just said, how come 10 minutes earlier I saw Vinny at 31k?
[176:17.67]Like, they don't understand what happened.
[176:19.74]We've confused the chat.
[176:21.14]Just gaslight them.
[176:22.22]Say it never happened.
[176:23.00]Chat, what do you mean?
[176:25.60]I'm gonna... 31k.
[176:28.22]I'm gonna put my dispenser over behind this fence over here.
[176:32.66]Someone raid Ster?
[176:36.36]Yeah, chat, I would always have 31k if I didn't do the diaper chief bit.
[176:45.58]Wait, diapers?
[176:46.56]Someone say diapers?
[176:48.12]Diaper Chief in particular.
[176:49.72]It's a bit that my chat really, really likes.
[176:52.85]What is it?
[176:55.19]Well... You know the DARPA Chief in Metal Gear Solid?
[177:04.67]Hmm?
[177:05.71]Do you know the DARPA Chief in Metal Gear Solid?
[177:08.63]What?
[177:09.17]Sure.
[177:12.29]It's the diaper chief.
[177:13.81]Anyway, let's kill that tank.
[177:15.70]Okay.
[177:16.68]That's good.
[177:17.10]You know what?
[177:17.42]That deserves a raid.
[177:18.20]I'm going to send some people over.
[177:21.24]Yeah, thanks, man.
[177:22.52]If you guys like diaper jokes, then welcome over to Diaper Chief.
[177:24.94]Grown-ass man talking about diaper jokes.
[177:26.96]Grown-ass man.
[177:29.26]Diaper sauce.
[177:30.69]Grown-ass man sauce.
[177:32.35]Oh, I wish I didn't say that.
[177:34.31]Can't talk about diapers?
[177:35.23]Can't talk about diapers?
[177:39.79]There are not many diaper streamers on Twitch, so, you know, it's a niche that you got to fill, like a diaper itself.
[177:44.59]What do you mean, not many?
[177:46.45]Like, do you think there are some?
[177:48.19]Oh, yeah.
[177:48.95]Yeah, there's a few, right?
[177:50.71]Yeah.
[177:51.51]It's a limited amount, but someone's got to fill them.
[177:55.52]We have Ubered BigScout, and he just got Ubered.
[177:57.98]Oh, he's jumping.
[177:58.34]Oh, I just launched him.
[177:58.90]I launched him.
[177:59.46]Went far.
[177:59.86]Wait, we're good, right?
[178:02.22]He's dead?
[178:02.54]Yeah, I think we're good.
[178:03.70]Yeah, he's dead.
[178:04.32]Alright, cool, cool, cool.
[178:04.92]Giving us a boost.
[178:05.54]It's tank time.
[178:11.02]Fucking medics.
[178:16.41]I got this tank, if you guys want to focus the other thing.
[178:21.19]I'll crit you now, just to work on the tank.
[178:22.67]Oh, hey man, thanks for the raid.
[178:27.23]It's weird that you'd raid me and we're all still playing together.
[178:29.19]Is it like end stream?
[178:30.32]Yeah, I think I'm going to wrap it up here.
[178:33.28]Okay.
[178:34.97]That's so fucking funny.
[178:37.97]You know what I realized?
[178:38.79]If we all send our viewers to Ludwig, like, just tell them to go there.
[178:43.11]No, it's not possible.
[178:45.25]Well, we can just tell everybody to go.
[178:46.81]Going from Twitch to YouTube is like the Trail of Tears of the social world.
[178:51.22]Well, so what would be funny is, like, they would all show up.
[178:53.14]So many would be lost along the way.
[178:54.30]It's horrible.
[178:54.58]And then they would leave, and YouTube would go, oh, people hate this stream and start recommending it.
[179:01.18]Cool.
[179:01.50]I'm going to pick someone with three viewers.
[179:03.00]I'm doing this.
[179:04.14]Pass it along.
[179:05.25]Wait, you... We got snipers.
[179:11.45]I'll work on the snipers.
[179:12.33]So, who wants to raid?
[179:13.53]I'm just gonna raid the fucking food channel on Twitch.
[179:19.41]Is my ship over?
[179:20.55]Yeah.
[179:21.63]Like, we're all just gonna raid random people?
[179:23.13]There's a channel that has, uh, Scout and Petticoat, right?
[179:26.36]Don't come here.
[179:26.96]Oh, what?
[179:30.46]Uh, second tank.
[179:32.64]Okay, second tank down.
[179:37.20]I gotta say, though, we are handling expert.
[179:39.14]We've been doing very well.
[179:40.32]It'd be really funny if we sent everyone to someone that we know and then told them that we expect them to be sent back.
[179:50.11]You get these for 10 minutes.
[179:51.45]They're all alone.
[179:59.05]We don't have your emotes.
[180:01.08]We don't speak your tongue here.
[180:04.27]If we found a small viewer, we'll send all of them over.
[180:09.59]We find a small viewer, tell them, hey, you want this big raid, but you only have it for 10 minutes.
[180:15.57]Get the raid someone else.
[180:16.67]What do you do in those 10 minutes?
[180:19.27]Sounds like a MrBeast video.
[180:20.11]You do your best bit.
[180:21.11]You do the diaper chief bit.
[180:22.49]Always.
[180:26.06]I'm down to do it if you guys are.
[180:29.49]I'll do it.
[180:29.85]Oh, I thought you meant like if you were the streamer getting raided, what do you do in those 10 minutes you have the viewers?
[180:33.98]That's what I'm saying.
[180:35.12]Oh yeah, you do your best bit.
[180:37.68]I undress.
[180:39.40]Oh.
[180:40.87]Where are you streaming these days?
[180:45.75]We are about, I think, to beat Expert, aren't we?
[180:49.01]Yeah.
[180:49.75]I'll pop you right now.
[180:50.59]Go.
[180:50.99]I'm really surprised.
[180:51.92]This has been pretty easy considering we're barely paying attention at this point.
[180:55.58]Yeah, you guys did a great job.
[180:56.72]This is actually... I cannot attest to that.
[180:59.92]I've been dripping sweat.
[181:02.90]No, you've been pulling.
[181:05.78]Big numbers, bud.
[181:07.00]I've been watching you.
[181:07.67]I've been seeing what you're doing.
[181:10.17]I see you doing the jump spin down move.
[181:12.39]I've seen it.
[181:13.67]I do, like, I do it a couple times.
[181:15.11]It's, like, stupid, though.
[181:15.85]It's, like, not even helpful.
[181:16.95]I have crit for you.
[181:19.17]Go.
[181:23.65]I have two more crit canteens.
[181:24.83]I'm just going to give them to you one at a time.
[181:26.21]Go.
[181:31.02]And last one.
[181:31.74]Go.
[181:36.66]I'm just going to shoot the snipers back there because they're annoying.
[181:41.10]Do it.
[181:42.71]Well, I think we got it.
[181:43.95]I think we do.
[181:44.35]I think so.
[181:45.35]The the other mission remaining is, I think, considered to be the hardest one.
[181:50.01]Is that the like 99 wave one?
[181:51.01]That's the one of this tour.
[181:54.99]I mean, this is one of this tour is I forget the name of it, but it doesn't look like Dust Bowl.
[182:02.14]It's like a whole metal city.
[182:03.88]We did it.
[182:04.52]Nice job.
[182:05.12]Yeah.
[182:05.78]Yeah.
[182:06.34]Well done.
[182:07.79]I got a drink.
[182:08.81]No whammy, no whammy, no whammy.
[182:10.13]Give me something good, baby.
[182:11.01]Something good.
[182:11.41]Something good here.
[182:12.01]No whammy, no whammy.
[182:12.85]Nothing but a hat.
[182:13.49]Nothing but a hat.
[182:14.15]Come on.
[182:14.41]What is it?
[182:14.77]Give it to me.
[182:15.15]Give it to me.
[182:15.55]Give it to me.
[182:17.21]It's... What the fuck is that?
[182:20.27]It's the Battalion's Backup.
[182:22.47]Don't say it in a cool voice.
[182:23.35]Oh, come on, man.
[182:24.89]I have that already.
[182:26.51]I got that 10 years ago.
[182:27.69]What the heck?
[182:34.73]Nobody got a hat.
[182:35.94]Like last time.
[182:39.32]Oh, Trinitallians back up.
[182:41.80]Alright, gamers.
[182:42.82]Should this be the end here?
[182:44.56]I think that's a good one.
[182:45.62]That was fun as heck.
[182:47.56]I want to go out heroes, so I'm worried if we escalate.
[182:49.88]That was awesome.
[182:52.18]Very, very good time.
[182:53.99]I had, seriously, some of the most fun I've had in a while, so yeah, this is a great game, and you guys are awesome.
[183:01.47]Then why is it over?
[183:02.83]Thanks for the sick raid, by the way.
[183:07.09]So, seven days of Dyson?
[183:09.75]I wouldn't be opposed.
[183:10.77]I'm in.
[183:13.11]I'm in.
[183:14.85]Roblox, boys.
[183:16.61]Whoa.
[183:17.27]Now we're cooking.
[183:18.59]Now we're cooking.
[183:19.47]I was waiting for some gas to come up.
[183:21.86]Some real gaming.
[183:22.94]There you go.
[183:24.94]Alright.
[183:25.66]I'm going to continue.
[183:27.26]In this disc, we'll write something and we'll play a video game next time.
[183:31.10]If you guys are down.
[183:32.00]That works.
[183:32.34]Video game sounds good.
[183:34.86]Thanks, Jerma, for organizing this.
[183:36.84]Appreciate you, Jerma.
[183:37.54]Appreciate everybody else for coming, playing.
[183:39.22]That was great.
[183:40.78]Thanks for taking the invite.
[183:41.76]It was a lot of fun.
[183:42.88]Good games.
[183:43.88]GG's, y'all.
[183:44.68]Is anybody actually continuing to stream that I can raid?
[183:47.68]I'm going to be live.
[183:48.80]Oh, yeah.
[183:49.10]Who is actually going to continue to be live?
[183:52.07]Actually, you know what?
[183:52.69]Don't answer that.
[183:53.11]It's funnier if you immediately go offline.
[183:55.15]That's true.
[183:55.47]Because you can rate offline channels.
[183:57.47]I don't need to actually know if you're staying live.
[183:59.13]This is now my Sunday stream.
[184:00.53]This is where I'm playing terrible stuff.
[184:02.67]So I'm going to go do my terrible stuff after good stuff.
[184:05.66]Goodbye, everyone.
[184:06.22]Hey, Vinny.
[184:07.58]Here come the viewers.
[184:08.16]Bye, Vinny.
[184:09.60]Thank you.
[184:10.24]Goodbye.
[184:10.66]You don't have to, by the way.
[184:11.62]I'm fine.
[184:12.38]But I'll see you later.
[184:13.34]Bye.
[184:15.24]Oh, before I go, I've been thinking about this the whole time.
[184:18.70]You got to play this one game.
[184:20.70]And anyone else, but I really want to see Dremel play this one game.
[184:23.82]Wait, wait, you don't care if I play it?
[184:25.94]Not really, I'll be honest.
[184:30.16]I mean, you would play it and hate it.
[184:32.95]I know you.
[184:33.57]Yeah, okay, yep, yep, yep, I get it.
[184:36.13]Well, then what's the game?
[184:37.91]Bouncing Duck Simulator.
[184:40.78]Bouncing Duck Simulator?
[184:42.44]Vinny, is that the game?
[184:43.02]That's not the game you play, right?
[184:44.32]The Placid Plastic Duck Simulator?
[184:45.88]No, it's different.
[184:46.45]Was it Bouncing Duck Simulator?
[184:47.77]Oh yeah, Vinny, you too.
[184:48.69]Vinny, 100% you'd like this.
[184:49.87]I'm a big duck guy, yeah.
[184:51.13]Bouncing Duck.
[184:52.25]Sir, we'll talk later.
[184:52.93]Alright.
[184:55.31]Yeah, you guys would love this.
[184:57.08]Sir, I'll talk to you later.
[184:58.80]Yeah, we'll have a... Was it Dancing or Bouncing?
[185:02.88]Bouncing... Actually...
[185:06.72]Bouncing Doug Simulator.
[185:08.34]You know what, Doug?
[185:08.96]You in this too.
[185:10.34]Alright, I'm in.
[185:11.24]Yeah, let's all play it.
[185:12.96]Wow, that'll be fun for you guys.
[185:16.10]I'm gonna hate it.
[185:18.60]He's gonna seriously hate every second of it.
[185:21.01]Ster, you can watch.
[185:21.75]We'll talk.
[185:24.51]Oh, dude, we're all gonna get in a call and just restream Ster's stream playing Five Nights at Freddy's?
[185:29.93]That sounds like fun.
[185:33.42]Yeah, I'll raid that.
[185:34.09]Alright, that was fun.
[185:36.03]I'll see you guys.
[185:37.01]Later, y'all.
[185:38.13]Bye-bye.
[185:43.57]Alright.
[185:44.71]That was a lot of fun.
[185:45.85]Hopefully you guys had a good time.
[185:50.98]The vibes were immaculate.
[185:54.24]So I will... I didn't plan on streaming for too long tonight, but I'll be live tomorrow.
[186:02.07]My voice is like
[186:03.84]dry.
[186:04.20]Need some water.
[186:05.82]Tomorrow we're going to play Sorcery Part 4.
[186:07.54]We're going to start it.
[186:12.56]And there's also going to be quite a few things to talk about tomorrow.
[186:17.02]Monster Grotto Beasts TTS mod discussion.
[186:21.85]Going to be showing it off.
[186:23.19]And something else.
[186:26.09]So Grotto Beasts info tomorrow.
[186:32.13]And Sorcery.
[186:34.62]What about Viewfinder?
[186:35.94]Yeah, I do want to play it.
[186:37.46]I do.
[186:38.00]I do.
[186:38.52]I do.
[186:44.16]What about the BLT?
[186:45.14]Yeah, I'll be munching on a BLT tomorrow, of course.
[186:51.82]What time?
[186:52.84]Probably a little later than today's stream.
[186:58.20]So thinking somewhere around... Oh, I'm still on the screen.
[187:03.99]Hold on, you know what?
[187:04.73]Let me... Let me just open the last few crates that I have, right?
[187:09.77]Like, what am I?
[187:11.81]I have one more key.
[187:12.79]Which one?
[187:18.13]I have one key remaining.
[187:20.75]Which crate am I going to open with this?
[187:24.56]Which one of these is considered a good one?
[187:25.82]92? 92?
[187:34.39]I don't have everything from here.
[187:39.58]92, 92, 92, 92.
[187:40.26]Okay.
[187:43.76]It's so funny.
[187:44.26]I can still see raiders from different channels talking in here.
[187:51.26]A raider from Doug Doug.
[187:52.82]When did you, when did you get here?
[187:56.55]I'll do 92.
[188:07.51]just happened.
[188:11.05]Eh.
[188:12.25]It's kind of cool.
[188:17.48]Alright.
[188:18.62]I will see you guys later.
[188:19.80]See you tomorrow.
[188:20.74]Probably starting around probably like 5 Pacific.
[188:26.05]Somewhere around there.
[188:28.58]Chill with some later evening sorcery.
[188:32.21]Talk about some announcement stuff.
[188:34.09]Go over some stuff that's going to be fun.
[188:36.91]And I am actually going to genuinely raid Vinny.
[188:40.89]So, I don't even know whose chat I'm in right now.
[188:43.13]Am I in my chat?
[188:51.08]There we go.
[188:53.94]Yeah, Vinny's doing his Sunday stream.
[188:58.77]This is Poke's chat right now.
[189:01.87]That's right.
[189:02.49]It says you're raiding from DougDoug, but you actually came from Poke.
[189:09.26]So you might just be Poke's chat.
[189:12.18]I don't know.
[189:12.78]I'm confused.
[189:13.74]But it was very fun.
[189:24.27]Talk to you guys tomorrow.
[189:26.57]See you soon.
[189:34.28]I didn't even tweet.
[189:35.46]No, I didn't.
[189:36.21]I don't even.
[189:37.13]It doesn't really matter.
[189:37.91]I'm so disconnected from all social media.
[189:43.45]Twitter, Discord.
[189:45.15]I don't even let you use it.
[189:52.09]Tweet now, dude.
[189:53.09]I don't know.
[189:53.63]I don't want to.
[190:00.97]Tweet that the stream is over.
[190:03.97]That's a really funny joke.
[190:06.45]I mean that.
[190:07.57]That's good material.
[190:10.80]But no.
[190:11.48]I don't think so.
[190:17.36]Alright.
[190:19.94]Good stuff.
[190:20.50]See you tomorrow.
[190:21.38]Take care.
[190:22.10]Call your mother.
[190:24.96]See you later.
