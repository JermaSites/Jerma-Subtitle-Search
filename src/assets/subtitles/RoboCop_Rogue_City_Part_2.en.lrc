[ve:61.1.100]

[00:02.24]Alright, let's go.
[00:03.16]I think the last thing that happened is I put a laugh track on in the car and we all laughed at it and then we kept going.
[00:14.14]But thank you, Predator.
[00:15.46]Thank you, Game Pass, PC Game Pass.
[00:18.12]And let's go with the gameplay.
[00:20.68]Can you put the video in a loop on the bottom right?
[00:31.23]Dude, I can't.
[00:32.72]I would get so annoying after a while, but maybe... Should I?
[00:36.24]Would that make you happy on my birthday?
[00:40.36]Alright, we gotta follow the blood.
[00:53.00]Whoa!
[00:53.46]I put... I didn't turn it down.
[00:56.73]Wait, there's people on motorcycles?
[01:00.06]I forgot how to play the game.
[01:02.08]Oh my.
[01:12.97]Wait, can I suck them up?
[01:16.25]Oh, I can.
[01:17.07]Alright.
[01:18.59]Alright, I'm going to make him run his friend over.
[01:25.42]Shit.
[01:25.54]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:27.70]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:33.84]Did I shoot the tires?
[01:42.89]And that's the power of the Predator Orion 7000.
[01:45.53]The slow motion was liquid, crystal clear.
[01:56.47]Can I ride the bike?
[01:58.05]Oh.
[02:06.24]Where should I... It has been too... Okay, why did I stop playing this game?
[02:12.71]What is wrong with me?
[02:13.91]Why did I stop playing this?
[02:19.68]Who... Why didn't you guys tell me to keep playing this?
[02:29.63]Okay.
[02:30.63]We did, we did.
[02:31.69]Alright, is it too loud?
[02:32.53]Should I turn it down a little bit?
[02:35.75]I'll turn it down a little.
[02:37.78]Because it's kind of loud.
[02:42.32]You're going to hit me with a hammer?
[02:46.55]Did you see what I just did?
[02:47.33]Oh my god.
[02:50.44]I actually let him touch me.
[03:00.25]How could Robocop lose to this guy?
[03:02.36]Can I not get rid of him like this?
[03:09.05]No way, dude.
[03:10.15]I'm sorry.
[03:11.15]I'm sorry.
[03:11.67]There's no way.
[03:12.57]There's no way.
[03:13.21]That doesn't happen.
[03:14.44]I have to actually... I gotta heal.
[03:34.20]Got him.
[03:35.72]Hey, eat this.
[03:38.39]Ooh!
[03:42.64]I haven't seen this in so long, actually.
[03:45.89]I did get the save up to where I needed it to be, but... Are you live right now?
[03:52.54]No, you're watching a PowerPoint presentation of somebody's project.
[03:58.70]I don't know.
[04:09.80]Dude, can I tell you that I had a huge neck stretch the other day?
[04:13.57]And it changed my entire life.
[04:15.72]The trajectory of the rest of my life changed because of that.
[04:22.47]Is this a Word document?
[04:24.23]Just wait.
[04:25.56]Give it... Okay.
[04:27.08]Give it 20 to 30 more years.
[04:30.12]Somebody will be running like Robocop in a Word document.
[04:38.41]Just like how... Look, I got... Oh, I got Mario Brothers to run on a watch.
[04:44.00]Just wait.
[04:46.34]The computers are going to be so crazy.
[04:47.93]You'll be able to do it.
[04:53.83]Yeah, somebody got, like, I got Doom to run on my refrigerator.
[04:57.13]Just wait another 20, 30 years.
[05:05.34]When do I need to investigate?
[05:06.31]Anything?
[05:07.47]Wait, give me this.
[05:10.79]He couldn't even remember Doom.
[05:13.42]Hey!
[05:17.62]Alright, I'm going to follow the music.
[05:20.66]Oh, no, no, no, no, wait.
[05:21.44]It was better to go this way.
[05:22.88]Sorry, I was talking to you.
[05:33.04]The green slime?
[05:39.41]Oh, I'm bumping into the wall.
[05:40.79]Okay.
[05:51.42]Okay, I'm sorry, but I've just seen Robocop.
[05:57.21]You hear him slowly walking around and you're sitting here scared like, oh shit.
[06:02.69]Robocop's in the house.
[06:03.66]Robocop's in the room.
[06:04.74]I hear him like four rooms down in the concrete.
[06:06.54]You just hear echoes like gung, gung, gung.
[06:10.18]Where am I going?
[06:13.09]Goong.
[06:14.01]I don't know.
[06:14.39]I don't understand.
[06:14.99]Where do I need to go?
[06:16.99]Was it this way?
[06:18.25]And then finally you see this guy walk around the corner.
[06:20.56]Goong.
[06:20.86]And he's holding a propane tank.
[06:24.96]And you shoot the propane tank.
[06:27.80]And he explodes.
[06:31.21]Oh my goodness.
[06:33.57]I need to heal.
[06:36.45]Oh.
[06:38.00]Okay.
[06:39.90]What do you got in here?
[06:43.56]You're in deep trouble.
[06:47.47]Alright, sure.
[06:48.29]Game's quiet.
[06:51.33]Turn it up.
[06:59.68]Turn it up a little.
[07:13.43]long ago they brought him here he was already in real bad shape I kind of felt for the guy where is he once he got back on his feet they took him away but I don't know where put the video in the corner hold on I'll put alright for like 10 minutes
[07:44.63]Do not move until I return.
[07:48.50]Okay.
[07:48.72]No problem.
[07:50.28]If anyone finds me cuffed up here, I will look at you.
[07:55.31]Live PC footage.
[08:04.29]Yeah, but how would I be down there?
[08:08.34]Alright, here we go.
[08:09.41]Here's how we're going to do this.
[08:12.09]Hey, guys.
[08:13.51]Yeah, I'm... I just wanted to show the PC on stream.
[08:17.80]I have a friend over that's playing the game, but I just wanted to take a look, see in here.
[08:22.77]I'm not playing right now.
[08:23.49]I just wanted to make sure you saw this.
[08:25.43]But this thing is crazy.
[08:26.75]It's awesome.
[08:27.61]Predator Orion 7000.
[08:28.56]Dude, you go... Oh, no, go up.
[08:32.46]Yeah, you're going the right way.
[08:34.61]I don't want you talking, though.
[08:36.86]So take a look in here.
[08:37.64]It's got the components.
[08:38.80]We've got an RTX 5080 in here.
[08:41.75]We've got an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K processor in here.
[08:52.54]Oh my god.
[08:53.40]Dude, use the sludge hammer!
[08:55.51]Use the sludge hammer!
[08:59.97]Are you playing with your feet?
[09:04.10]Okay, I need to go to the warehouse office.
[09:05.38]Let's go.
[09:09.16]Just get the shit out of me.
[09:11.85]I'm sorry.
[09:14.79]I just hit my head on the ceiling.
[09:16.67]Alright, would that hurt real bad?
[09:18.72]Even if you're Robocop, if I just smashed my head bang like that, would it hurt?
[09:29.76]Come on.
[09:31.08]He really is 40.
[09:32.14]That was scary.
[09:37.06]That whole area is out of police jurisdiction.
[09:39.98]And according to the new policy, if we wanted to legally be there, we'd need to go through an OCP executive.
[09:47.37]And I'm sure you know that.
[09:51.61]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[09:52.57]Give me that bike.
[09:55.05]I got an idea.
[09:55.97]Alright, we're gonna do this.
[09:58.40]I want another bike.
[10:04.24]Can somebody please drive over here, please?
[10:07.51]No!
[10:08.58]Yes, here we go.
[10:15.77]Wait, that did not happen the way I wanted it to happen, but it was still funny.
[10:30.77]Are you sure it's not loud?
[10:32.11]I feel like it's wicked loud.
[10:48.94]Get out of the way!
[10:49.98]Get!
[10:53.25]Did I just steal somebody's money?
[10:56.29]I stole that guy's wallet!
[11:07.69]Ah!
[11:11.91]Got it.
[11:20.14]Dude, sick PC.
[11:21.19]Can you pan down some more?
[11:24.85]Uh-oh.
[11:32.74]Oh!
[11:33.94]Shit.
[11:38.97]Hold on.
[11:39.35]Where was I?
[11:45.24]Alright, we gotta get the live PC cam off.
[11:51.50]it is a little bit loud that's what I told you alright I got it this time I'm gonna let's go I want these guys to crash
[12:20.66]Come on, just crash!
[12:35.65]Am I going to have this guy in my hand?
[12:39.76]Alright, here we go.
[12:53.62]I love how they're on the motorcycle.
[12:54.62]This is great.
[12:55.66]Wait, he's going to be behind me.
[13:05.34]There's so many people there.
[13:15.02]Alright, we're good.
[13:21.98]Where is he?
[13:33.04]Wait, was that the guy?
[13:34.12]Oh my God.
[13:44.87]God alright.
[13:47.11]No more messing around.
[13:51.70]Oh, that's right.
[13:52.06]You get the modules, don't you?
[13:54.14]Don't I have to... I can like upgrade myself.
[13:55.44]I can put hips in my body and everything.
[13:59.79]You should turn all sound off except for voices.
[14:05.57]Okay.
[14:06.52]I'll do that in a minute.
[14:11.72]I'll try that in a minute.
[14:12.60]Hold on.
[14:15.35]That's going to be really weird.
[14:26.01]a broadcaster okay so he calls in reinforcements we'll stop that from happening probably watching why no one's coming and why no one will
[14:52.08]This is no proving ground for heroes.
[14:56.12]It's their cemetery.
[14:57.86]Bastard shot me.
[15:02.05]Stings like a bitch.
[15:05.53]I feel like I'm having a dream.
[15:07.84]This is sick.
[15:11.20]Metal Fox coming.
[15:14.93]Blow his damn fucking head off.
[15:19.71]Vultures attack.
[15:20.87]Slag him.
[15:25.25]Does he say anything?
[15:29.34]Why is it?
[15:32.80]He's not, is he saying anything?
[15:38.47]He didn't say anything.
[15:39.19]Okay, dude, that's enough.
[15:55.26]What were these even on?
[15:56.26]50?
[16:03.67]Oh!
[16:04.85]Oh!
[16:13.40]I want to just grab him off.
[16:14.58]Wait, wait till he goes by again.
[16:15.40]I need health.
[16:17.02]Jeez!
[16:25.97]I actually have to try really hard.
[16:27.23]I don't want to start over from the checkpoint.
[16:31.30]What was that guy doing?
[16:41.67]Where is he?
[16:45.30]How many reinforcements does this guy have?
[16:57.64]Oh, I actually got him.
[17:10.86]Oh shit, I'm in trouble.
[17:20.35]Go.
[17:21.43]I need health bad.
[17:27.88]Is there health in here?
[17:29.11]Am I in the dumpster?
[17:31.67]If I crouch in the dumpster, can I hide?
[17:36.63]Wait, big shield.
[17:41.46]This guy can't see me.
[17:54.25]Okay, I can't mess around.
[17:55.01]I need health bad right now.
[18:03.05]I am 40, I think.
[18:04.57]Because that was scary.
[18:05.36]That was scarier than a horror game.
[18:26.90]The screen got cut off.
[18:28.09]I have the noise gate on.
[18:45.80]Okay, investigate the warehouse office.
[18:48.66]Will there be health potions in there?
[18:51.66]Ah, I thought... Don't do that to me.
[18:59.51]I thought there was something wrong with my... I thought my power just went out.
[19:10.79]Yes, there it is.
[19:15.18]Dude, I've been getting kind of flickering lights.
[19:18.85]I gotta get an electrician.
[19:22.11]Maybe a bulb, because... Oh!
[19:35.17]Why is everything scaring me?
[19:37.58]Everything's scary and everything's loud.
[19:39.44]Am I- is this what happens when you become 40?
[19:42.02]Everything's just loud.
[19:43.77]I don't like loud noises.
[19:46.23]Now, and I- you know what?
[19:48.02]I don't like that.
[19:48.66]They're partying across the street.
[19:50.12]It's loud.
[19:50.82]I don't like those loud sounds that come from that party.
[19:55.21]This is a noise complaint.
[19:57.69]This is what happens.
[20:05.21]Do you just become more sensitive to all loud sounds?
[20:11.98]If that does that again, I'm going to turn it down.
[20:13.74]It might do it again.
[20:20.46]Oh.
[20:21.94]Upgrade.
[20:23.84]You sound so distressed, it's okay to be old.
[20:26.29]Here's the thing.
[20:27.69]I might sound distressed, but it is new.
[20:32.58]This is a, you know, when a zero appears next to your, you know, name or whatever.
[20:39.15]When your age has a zero at the end.
[20:41.46]Like, wait a minute.
[20:43.16]This time has gone by.
[20:44.30]30.
[20:47.99]It's like, whoa, I'm 30.
[20:51.75]So I'm getting used to it.
[20:54.32]Gonna do, it's gonna do something.
[20:59.23]Ooh.
[21:06.16]Yeah, that was, that had to have been a probably, that was probably an RTX 5080.
[21:13.20]Plug that in.
[21:23.28]Well, I was a VHS.
[21:24.44]I was wrong.
[21:38.39]this do you people call you unk now people have been calling me unk for like three years well cop now we know you won't be leaving here in one piece you won't either hey you're spoiling my mood again I don't like it when cops wander around
[22:02.41]Cops mean trouble.
[22:04.65]And trouble upsets me.
[22:07.37]So really, this is your fault.
[22:10.10]Do whatever you want.
[22:12.04]But soon the cops will... Wait, what?
[22:16.83]Oh, it's this guy.
[22:17.55]No cop of any kind is going to show up here anymore.
[22:20.29]They have two shotguns?
[22:21.47]The police officially won't be responding to any calls from this area.
[22:27.26]Does this mean we have a deal?
[22:29.08]As long as you can work quietly.
[22:33.22]We're vultures.
[22:35.18]You need carrying.
[22:37.13]We're up to the job, no worries.
[22:40.47]And as for your toy... Fuel welding?
[22:44.24]Would you like to join us?
[22:46.40]A fine offer.
[22:48.37]Sealing our contract in blood.
[22:51.09]But I prefer cleaner games.
[22:55.38]How about instead we do some
[22:59.53]Spice things up a bit.
[23:04.66]And I know just the right place for it.
[23:07.96]How does it feel knowing we're gonna take you to the quarry and shoot your ass to pieces?
[23:19.04]And the police ain't gonna do shit about it.
[23:26.95]I bet it really pisses him off.
[23:31.86]Do I get to drop a computer on that guy's head at the end of the game?
[23:36.53]I just want to drop a PC monitor on his head.
[23:43.10]Because you can pick these up in this game.
[23:44.55]Can I just drop one on him?
[23:49.26]I found a tape of Briggs being tortured.
[23:51.92]Their boss Spike was in on it.
[23:53.99]Together with Wendell Antonowski.
[23:56.39]Did you say he was tortured?
[23:58.79]Yes.
[23:59.49]Surrounded with no way out and no backup.
[24:02.72]That sounds so messed up.
[24:03.84]Dialog is too quiet.
[24:04.72]Here, I'll do this.
[24:05.18]They used him as prey.
[24:06.68]They mentioned a quarry.
[24:08.68]Here's what we'll do.
[24:10.09]Ready?
[24:10.31]Check this out.
[24:12.23]Boom.
[24:15.15]Boom.
[24:16.50]Boom.
[24:18.02]Boom.
[24:19.32]Perfect.
[24:20.86]I can't go that way.
[24:32.80]Can't go that way either.
[24:42.80]Let's try the way that I came in, instead of walking around in a circle.
[24:49.81]That should work.
[25:04.09]Here, let me do this too.
[25:18.61]Alright.
[25:20.36]You sure it's not too loud?
[25:23.54]That looks good.
[25:25.60]It is.
[25:31.07]Alright.
[25:31.95]Follow Officer Briggs' trail.
[25:34.16]There's a lot of... Did I just get everybody?
[25:41.35]How do I crouch?
[25:45.33]Does Robocop drink gas?
[25:46.79]I don't know.
[25:51.54]No!
[26:03.71]Perfect!
[26:11.28]Where?
[26:16.05]What?
[26:16.17]Why did I think that was gonna work?
[26:20.70]I need more ammo.
[26:27.32]Bad.
[26:38.46]Good.
[26:42.22]Alright, we got one, two.
[26:43.88]Let me get the assessment.
[26:45.26]One, two, three.
[26:46.29]Watch this.
[26:48.19]Oh!
[26:50.58]Watch this.
[26:51.12]Ready?
[26:52.32]I scanned it.
[26:58.23]That would have been sick, wouldn't it?
[26:59.27]If I got that guy on the right.
[27:00.80]How amazing would that have been?
[27:07.03]Get the tin cans!
[27:08.31]You're there.
[27:09.27]That's the quarry.
[27:11.69]I hope you find Briggs.
[27:13.55]I will not stop until I do.
[27:17.42]Oh, so you think you're a tough guy, huh?
[27:21.82]I can pull him through the wall.
[27:23.94]You'll love our place in the Northwest.
[27:26.86]Come on, come a little closer.
[27:28.35]And I'm telling you now, there's plenty.
[27:31.89]And let's not forget the other one in the north.
[27:34.19]It's filled with them crazy drugs we skimmed off those stupid punks.
[27:38.98]That's super unleaded.
[27:40.80]That's not something that would interest you.
[27:44.02]He's clearly prepared an ambush for you.
[27:46.77]That's why you won't try to go there, right?
[27:51.21]money that would be what a sick thing to do that one yeah that did yeah that was awesome they gotta have a character in a movie or a game or something that you need to drink gasoline or whatever and you throw it in the air and do that that's just part of the you drank it animation that happens every single time
[28:27.78]I didn't do anything.
[28:29.18]I just walked in here.
[28:30.55]I just got here.
[28:31.25]I didn't do anything.
[28:36.30]Oh, that's what that was.
[28:39.58]How did I not step on that one?
[28:41.61]Your move, creep.
[28:44.21]You want a piece of us?
[28:59.91]They're not going to walk over here?
[29:00.91]Come on, walk over here.
[29:04.70]How far away do I need to be for them to walk over here?
[29:10.46]Oh, whatever.
[29:12.09]Can I pick up the... Can I pick... Maybe I can.
[29:17.75]No, you cannot pick up the mines.
[29:20.19]No, you can't, guys.
[29:21.06]And now I'm going to die.
[29:28.92]Why would they walk into the minefield?
[29:30.56]Why would I walk into the minefield?
[29:33.83]I just did.
[29:45.62]No!
[29:50.63]Wait, I can pick these ones up.
[29:53.64]Will they go off if I go near them?
[30:02.18]I wanted to step on it.
[30:08.19]Give me this thing.
[30:08.91]Let's go.
[30:29.45]Come on!
[30:30.21]One of those didn't hit him.
[30:35.59]I was hoping that one of those pellets was gonna get him.
[30:44.60]Robocop.
[30:46.70]Rogue City is currently on Game Pass right now.
[30:50.87]Or on PC Game Pass.
[30:57.88]I do want to make sure to say the DLC is not on Game Pass.
[31:00.44]You would need to get the DLC separately, but the base game is.
[31:07.05]Alright, now I'm not going to get hurt.
[31:16.68]Alright, here we go.
[31:18.84]Hey, could we see your desktop setup?
[31:21.33]Oh yeah, dude, sure.
[31:22.19]I took a video.
[31:26.01]That is the Predator Orion 7000.
[31:29.86]What I'm playing on right now.
[31:36.95]And you will get three months of PC Game Pass with any Predator product.
[31:48.83]But there's a tiny man in there.
[31:50.83]That's me.
[32:03.89]Ugh.
[32:09.27]Did I get everybody?
[32:13.25]Alright, don't mess this up.
[32:18.60]Did you press the power button?
[32:19.72]I'm not going to press the power button right now.
[32:25.03]Alright, I'm good.
[32:29.85]This is it.
[32:30.47]Let's do it.
[32:31.53]Wait, I want help.
[32:38.68]Thank goodness.
[32:44.71]I'm going to use Jerma's setup to play Minecraft.
[32:50.76]It would look pretty damn good.
[32:55.78]Hey, can you put the... I can't really see the video that well.
[33:05.04]Can you put it at a higher speed so we can get a better view?
[33:08.10]Yeah.
[33:09.12]That's true.
[33:09.68]You want to be able to get the frame rate to show you the frame rate.
[33:21.77]Oh, shit!
[33:23.96]That doesn't even help.
[33:26.06]That looks so weird.
[33:28.20]Ah!
[33:28.58]Fuck.
[33:29.22]Okay, stop.
[33:29.76]I've just not got distracted.
[33:36.89]I forgot there were mines here.
[33:43.26]Like, oh my god, I can't... Okay.
[33:45.12]The guy in the lower left cannot believe the power.
[33:48.75]He's so shocked at how just truly powerful the Predator Orion 7000 is.
[33:53.65]He's gotta get a... He's gotta show you.
[33:55.27]He's gotta show you the whole time.
[33:56.80]Let me get a video of that.
[34:03.74]I gotta get down here.
[34:04.44]You gotta see this thing.
[34:23.05]That doesn't go through?
[34:26.73]How?
[34:29.74]I just wasted both of them.
[34:32.86]Can you make the video faster?
[34:34.34]I physically can't in OBS.
[34:36.54]I'm sorry.
[34:39.89]I can't.
[34:46.27]Okay, I will try.
[34:47.17]I will try to make the video faster just for a minute.
[34:51.18]And then I'm going to turn it off.
[34:58.84]No, the highest it goes up to is... Okay, what if I do slower?
[35:09.52]Get a real good look.
[35:29.39]Ooh, here we go.
[35:42.18]Did I get him?
[35:43.28]Hey!
[35:53.41]I paused it.
[35:54.15]I promise the video is not paused.
[35:57.75]I have no health.
[36:14.27]Did I put it on hard?
[36:15.67]Am I playing the game on hard?
[36:16.57]Anyone remember?
[36:18.56]Well, this is a different copy of it.
[36:24.12]What difficulty do I have it on?
[36:25.98]Is it on hard?
[36:33.55]It's on easy.
[36:34.43]It is not on easy.
[36:35.49]I guarantee it's not on easy.
[36:41.78]No, the video is not paused.
[36:42.90]I don't think so.
[36:46.55]There has to be health up here, right?
[36:47.75]Yep.
[36:48.09]Oh my goodness.
[36:49.13]That's so much health.
[36:56.20]Oh my goodness.
[37:05.00]Refresh the video.
[37:05.96]It's definitely not playing.
[37:07.58]It is no way!
[37:14.49]You can see the fan spinning!
[37:16.91]How long is this gonna take though?
[37:41.74]I don't have engineering level 6?
[37:42.78]What even are my skills?
[37:46.22]Alright, okay.
[37:49.83]You mean to tell me I need to be engineering 6 to open that right now?
[37:57.68]Take vitality.
[38:05.93]Dude, the music is making this so much better.
[38:08.71]Wait.
[38:21.24]¦
[38:54.13]Why is it freezing?
[39:25.50]Why am I on the floor like a slug?
[39:32.50]My PC is on the floor.
[39:33.95]What are you talking about?
[39:34.87]How was I going to get a video of this if I didn't get a crawl down there?
[40:01.41]This video is done.
[40:03.29]This video is done.
[40:04.20]I'm putting this one away forever now.
[40:07.24]That's the end of this video.
[40:11.65]Let's go.
[40:21.92]Wait.
[40:23.26]Did I pick it up already?
[40:32.58]I forgot I had a dash.
[40:36.97]I'm sorry.
[40:37.45]If I'm Robocop, I'm just jumping over this and just landing on my back.
[40:40.63]I don't even care.
[40:42.14]In fact, you're kind of indestructible, aren't you?
[40:44.50]I would just do a front flip off of this and land on my back for fun if I was Robocop.
[40:48.63]Why won't he just do that?
[41:04.86]You weigh 50 tons.
[41:06.64]So I make a dent in the concrete, whatever.
[41:08.20]How do I get out of here?
[41:17.45]Oh.
[41:25.82]Does it want me to go all the way?
[41:26.76]Where does it want me to go?
[41:28.08]Follow the trail.
[41:29.08]This is the wrong way.
[41:30.83]How do I get over there?
[41:34.92]Did I go all the way around?
[41:36.10]Did I miss a door?
[41:46.07]That was a huge splash.
[41:53.32]Holy shit.
[41:53.90]Do you see how many particles were on screen?
[42:01.18]We're cooking with the Predator Orion 7000 now.
[42:03.23]You understand?
[42:10.07]Doesn't matter how good of a computer you have, I still can't find the way to go through the game.
[42:20.36]Oh, what a super awesome, powerful, sick PC.
[42:24.27]You still can't navigate!
[42:25.87]You still can't do that, Jeremy!
[42:28.60]Shut up.
[42:28.96]Shut up!
[42:35.31]Did I have to go out the back door?
[42:39.70]Does anyone know how to get over there from here?
[42:58.08]It's impossible.
[42:58.86]No, it's not.
[43:00.28]There's probably a door I can go in.
[43:02.43]Okay, I'm gonna pay attention.
[43:03.17]Here we go.
[43:04.29]I came down here.
[43:05.83]I walked out here.
[43:07.67]Follow Officer Briggs' trail.
[43:11.78]Do I have to shoot this?
[43:24.65]I actually really don't know where to go.
[43:28.50]Hey, maybe you should get VR.
[43:32.10]Get VR, Josh, to give you the guide.
[43:34.03]I feel like it's all the way... Is it all the way around?
[43:49.07]I think it actually is.
[43:51.52]Yes, it is.
[43:52.86]I think it's straight through here and all the way around.
[44:07.60]Use your robo-GPS?
[44:10.81]Ah!
[44:11.63]God, no!
[44:16.24]I looked over on the other screen for a second.
[44:17.98]How do I get through this?
[44:19.20]Dash.
[44:21.01]Alright, here we go.
[44:21.69]I had to go around.
[44:22.37]I had to go around.
[44:27.40]Hey, you suck at this.
[44:28.30]I didn't know I had to go all the way around.
[44:30.74]I knew you wouldn't have the guts to mess with us on a home turf.
[44:42.10]You're just like that cowardly woodsman from that kid's
[44:48.69]Oh my god, please look at the ground!
[44:51.27]I was so focused on other things.
[44:58.52]They're everywhere!
[44:59.94]What?
[45:00.40]Hold on.
[45:00.82]This is how you deal with a minefield, okay?
[45:07.41]Like that.
[45:12.84]Oh, good.
[45:13.46]Alright.
[45:39.03]This is harder than the enemies.
[45:40.95]I still hear a beep.
[45:41.65]Where is it?
[45:51.65]I'm freaking out right now.
[45:52.65]Where is it?
[45:54.03]Oh my!
[45:54.48]It was underneath me.
[45:55.66]Was it?
[46:00.25]What the hell?
[46:06.22]I couldn't see it.
[46:07.96]They blend in with the ground.
[46:15.90]You walked right into it.
[46:27.98]Do you like Apple?
[46:29.81]Snapple Apple?
[46:30.65]I don't know.
[46:32.17]I don't think I had that in a long time.
[46:33.99]I don't know.
[46:35.31]Alright, here we go.
[46:36.02]Get rid of it all.
[46:43.05]I think I got that guy.
[46:46.87]That was a really bad gamer moment.
[46:49.38]I'm not going to get touched by another mine for the rest of the entire playthrough.
[46:59.12]You get it?
[47:10.44]That's not one?
[47:11.32]That's just a piece of lint.
[47:13.58]Where is this?
[47:25.36]I don't care.
[47:26.00]I got it.
[47:26.34]I made it.
[47:38.54]Give me that heal.
[47:39.90]Let's go.
[47:40.54]Alright.
[47:53.42]We got to keep following the trail down here.
[47:59.71]Street vultures turf.
[48:03.63]Oh, look at that light.
[48:16.69]Oh, that's not good.
[48:18.22]That's not good.
[48:19.96]I am in the freezer.
[48:28.83]What the hell?
[48:36.96]Oh my god!
[48:38.50]Get me back up, let's go.
[48:47.26]Damn, alright.
[48:58.80]Alright, regroup with the police squad.
[49:16.44]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[49:17.34]Don't.
[49:18.42]There's probably mines everywhere.
[49:20.16]Robocop, all available patrol cars are coming to support you.
[49:23.95]I've told them to meet you by the old workers building.
[49:26.57]According to reports,
[49:28.90]Oh shit, I forgot about this.
[49:30.28]I ran through this fast.
[49:31.94]Alright, we're good.
[49:44.56]Sniper.
[49:46.88]Alright, do I get access to one too?
[49:51.15]Whoa!
[50:02.50]I definitely can get one of those, right?
[50:11.63]Can I not get it?
[50:14.19]I want it.
[50:14.51]What the?
[50:16.53]Alright, I want to hit somebody with this.
[50:29.84]Alright, can I?
[50:30.42]Do you think I can get the sniper from all the way back here if I throw it?
[50:40.35]Damn it.
[50:52.62]Get me in the porta potty.
[51:02.05]Alright, I gotta go this way first.
[51:05.17]Wait!
[51:06.44]The number one bane of my entire existence on any video game.
[51:11.22]Stuff that's not directly in front of you that can hurt you.
[51:16.41]We're talking about mines.
[51:18.07]We're talking about spikes on the ground.
[51:20.67]If you want to make a video game that's guaranteed to get me specifically,
[51:27.08]make a game where there's a bunch of shit on the ground and it hurts you if you step in it everything else up here we're good like watch this got that guy it was nothing
[51:54.48]Ooh, is that heavy?
[51:55.70]Oh, no, I've used it before.
[51:58.31]Make a concrete maze game with mines in it.
[52:00.97]Yeah, that'd be horrible.
[52:03.12]Wait, wait, you forgot to add multiple layers.
[52:08.48]There is a... Okay, by the way, not just multiple layers.
[52:11.57]There's three or four basement levels.
[52:13.65]So there's B1 through B5.
[52:16.04]And there's 1F through 5F.
[52:20.00]And it's all concrete.
[52:22.90]And it wraps around on itself.
[52:29.17]And make there be backtracking a major part of the entire experience.
[52:39.86]What's that?
[52:43.00]Scan it.
[52:46.01]Am I scanning it?
[52:50.96]Deduction level 2 requires... I'm too stupid to know I can move that?
[52:57.09]What do you mean, any deduction level 2?
[52:59.79]I don't know what that is.
[53:01.11]Are those marks on the ground?
[53:02.50]I have no idea.
[53:05.76]There seems to be something behind this.
[53:07.22]I don't know.
[53:08.78]I don't move... I don't want to move it.
[53:10.84]I'm too tired.
[53:12.89]I'm too dumb to move a box, okay?
[53:21.03]That was perfect.
[53:27.34]This is the hardest sniper job of the whole game.
[53:53.59]what why am I so bad you need sniper rival level two to aim there's gotta be health back here right did I miss any health well I gotta go here no mines there are mines everywhere
[54:23.66]That's it, right?
[54:39.78]Okay, I already got this.
[54:43.34]So I'm just kind of wrapping back around then.
[54:56.80]Did I screw it up again?
[54:58.36]Was I not supposed to go back this way?
[55:12.50]He's the wrong way, Grandpa.
[55:14.38]I felt like I was going the right way.
[55:18.51]I have a map.
[55:19.91]Oh my goodness, I didn't press M!
[55:25.87]Alright, so I gotta go... This way.
[55:31.04]I can go down!
[55:33.14]Oh shit, hold on.
[55:36.51]Thank god I didn't walk forward.
[55:42.69]Okay, there's apparently like a tunnel I can go in.
[55:54.27]Oh!
[55:56.10]Oh, oh, come on.
[55:57.64]I'm too stupid to press a power on button.
[56:01.35]I just have to press that button, flip that switch and it'll turn on.
[56:04.93]I don't understand what that is.
[56:07.92]Is that grab guy by neck?
[56:09.92]I don't know.
[56:14.14]OK, so.
[56:17.65]There's something in here apparently, but where's this way to go?
[56:21.68]Is that the only way to go down?
[56:22.68]Do I have to move it and there's a way to go down?
[56:26.47]Let me just check over here.
[56:33.32]Because the map is a... Yeah.
[56:34.94]There's apparently a ladder.
[56:36.11]I guess.
[56:38.37]Oh.
[56:40.91]Well, what is this going to do for me?
[56:52.61]Oh.
[56:52.85]Dude, I almost went through the ground.
[56:55.37]Okay.
[56:55.77]Okay.
[56:57.30]Bold place of... I gotta go that way, so... What is this?
[57:04.35]Something through here?
[57:06.51]I guess?
[57:08.12]I don't know where to go.
[57:14.98]That's the right way, right?
[57:18.97]Didn't I just come from that way?
[57:34.23]Climb a random ladder to nowhere.
[57:37.33]And then through there?
[57:38.99]Yeah.
[57:40.27]Oh, there's one little narrow hallway I gotta go through.
[57:42.38]Where is it?
[57:43.98]Alright, it's over here.
[57:47.62]Okay.
[57:48.81]This is correct.
[57:49.43]Let's go.
[57:56.84]Come on.
[57:58.26]I'm too stupid to do anything, so I have to go back the way I came.
[58:02.81]All the way through the one corridor.
[58:04.59]I'm too dumb to activate this.
[58:06.58]I can't do that.
[58:07.16]I'm too stupid.
[58:08.60]Oh, but I could push that.
[58:09.80]No, I don't know what a push is.
[58:10.96]I don't know.
[58:26.16]You didn't level it.
[58:27.12]What did I level?
[58:28.10]I've leveled up, like, psychology.
[58:33.25]Ooh, hold on.
[58:48.51]Alright, here we go.
[58:49.48]We're good.
[59:01.65]Ooh!
[59:06.53]It's that thing.
[59:14.74]Let's do it.
[59:15.32]Good, you're here.
[59:16.86]We're standing our ground.
[59:18.26]The bikers have retreated to the yard behind that big gate.
[59:20.77]Oh, we're going in.
[59:21.51]Now, let's decide on the strike team.
[59:23.85]Me.
[59:24.05]I go on my own.
[59:25.37]No need to risk lives.
[59:27.67]OCP has supplied us with an ED-209.
[59:29.90]Maybe you could make use of it.
[59:31.60]Even if it is just for cover.
[59:33.78]Robocop, can I have a moment of your time?
[59:36.45]It's going to be three propane tanks.
[59:44.54]All I need is three propane tanks and a sledgehammer and I got it.
[60:02.39]I'm going in.
[60:06.67]Wait, can you come with me?
[60:26.86]I failed.
[60:29.47]Eliminate more enemies than your competitor to pass the efficiency challenge.
[60:34.42]Wait, it's me versus... Oh, okay.
[60:36.82]Let's do it.
[60:37.42]I have to get more.
[60:39.09]Oh, God.
[60:46.60]No, that's one for you.
[60:49.72]Wait.
[60:50.32]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[61:01.27]I'm dead I didn't okay I gotta pay attention to my health like I was so locked in I ran headfirst into everybody's gunfire I have no help he's gonna beat me wait wait wait I'm staying back watch this I'm gonna cheese this whole thing get out of the way you're blocking the TV
[61:45.51]Finally 3% health.
[61:47.21]Alright, I can let him get two kills.
[61:48.47]I need health so bad.
[62:11.46]There's a healer right there.
[62:12.56]Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[62:18.32]Yes!
[62:27.33]Alright, I'm currently in the lead by a lot, so I'm good.
[62:32.37]I thought I could grab the car for a second.
[62:45.71]Alright, 16 versus 9.
[62:47.11]That's good.
[62:51.34]Alright, get this open.
[63:03.98]Come on, I have to have a better... Come on!
[63:17.87]How did he get 18?
[63:19.13]Where?
[63:20.65]The fuck is he doing I can't shoot him
[63:54.44]Oh, we gotta go this way.
[64:06.07]This game is fun.
[64:15.13]Find a set of stairs, quick.
[64:17.79]Alright, here we go.
[64:19.25]This is the culmination of this mission.
[64:23.01]Alright, be on the lookout for health, and if you see health, say... Don't say anything.
[64:40.47]I guess I got it.
[64:46.34]That sounded like the T-Rex.
[64:57.41]Nice.

[66:17.04]Ooh.
[66:18.68]I like the shotgun.
[66:21.31]I don't get that many chances to use it because we're never in close quarters.
[66:24.59]A lot of this mission has been far away enemies.
