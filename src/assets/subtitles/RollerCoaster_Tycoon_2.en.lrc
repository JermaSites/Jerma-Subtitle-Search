[00:01.65]Back let's change the game and the title of the stream To roller coaster How about um Coast I'm just kind of chill and play roller coaster.
[00:20.07]What's what's a good title?
[00:26.01]Hmm roller bottom
[00:31.15]uh how about just rc rct2 just roller coaster tycoon 2. Twitch integration unfortunately Twitch integration no longer exists the server that was hosting it is no longer online so the only way you can do Twitch integration unfortunately is I would have to open and run my own server on my own computer with the uh
[00:57.39]it's no longer operational anymore.
[00:59.87]I'd have to make my own server.
[01:01.92]And that was going to take longer.
[01:03.52]I mean, I wanted to start streaming, so... So let me move over here.
[01:09.78]Yeah, and there was other reasons why I didn't really want to do that immediately.
[01:16.47]Like, I'll just turn it on and run like a Java server on my own computer.
[01:19.71]I feel like there's some security holes there that I would need to make sure weren't there.
[01:27.74]Alright, uh, hold on.
[01:35.75]I'm just gonna write Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 on sale now.
[01:42.27]No.
[01:43.33]Whatever.
[01:43.91]It doesn't matter.
[01:44.50]Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 with Jerma.
[02:05.48]That would be so bad.
[02:07.74]I can fix it later.
[02:08.64]We'll come up with a better one.
[02:10.30]Alright, let me get it open.
[02:17.56]I mean, we're talking like a true nostalgia factor right here.
[02:20.88]Don't ask me why today was the day we were going to play this.
[02:24.30]But it is.
[02:25.44]Can you hear it?
[02:26.80]I bet you so badly you guys want me to change the screen right now.
[02:29.40]Listen to that.
[02:33.03]You remember that?
[02:37.16]Alright.
[02:47.92]Start a new park.
[02:50.58]Roller Coaster Tycoon 2.
[02:53.82]Nope, never mind.
[03:01.42]There it is.
[03:03.54]Alright, so what do I want to start with?
[03:07.27]My own park, or should I... I gotta, like, kind of remember how to play.
[03:10.53]How about Crazy Castle?
[03:20.00]Yeah, this is open RCT.
[03:25.26]Build your own Six Flags adventure.
[03:28.58]Build your own Six Flags.
[03:29.99]Okay.
[03:31.57]I... Okay, you gotta... I remember this stuff.
[03:35.15]Build your own design.
[03:35.93]A six flags park.
[03:36.81]You have to build rides from other six flags parks.
[03:38.53]So design and build your own.
[03:40.03]You have to have 1,500 quests in your park at the end of October, year four, with a park rating of at least 600.
[03:45.18]Alright.
[03:46.66]So there are some things that I remember.
[03:48.04]I played this game a lot when I was younger.
[03:52.18]I played Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, I think even on this stream or on a video before.
[03:58.26]Admission price, what I typically do is I make the, I do it just like they do at every six flags you've ever been to.
[04:05.89]The park admission is like 30 or 40 bucks.
[04:09.05]Like 20 bucks.
[04:12.11]All the rides are free and then you just drain them at the concession stands.
[04:19.81]I'm not going to charge for toilets.
[04:21.79]That would make me a monster.
[04:24.27]But we need stuff here first.
[04:25.43]Let's pause it.
[04:27.07]How much money do I have?
[04:30.34]Okay, remember I got to remember the controls.
[04:31.80]You can spin it around too, can't you?
[04:33.99]So let's hold right click.
[04:35.59]Zoom in, zoom out.
[04:36.47]I like the zoom in.
[04:38.47]It's fine.
[04:38.97]Okay, so we need... This is... I got to name the park.
[04:44.15]What is it called?
[04:47.80]Where's my name the park thing here?
[04:54.50]I think I have to open it first.
[04:57.41]So I got a big open land.
[04:58.33]Let's do... Let's just get everything laid out.
[05:01.47]Let's do... Like, just dirt.
[05:07.23]Let's go dirt.
[05:08.05]Well, it's already kind of just this stone, right?
[05:09.87]What do you mean I can't do it when the game is paused?
[05:16.82]Why not?
[05:21.34]Let's go up here.
[05:22.26]I'm thinking a little line this way.
[05:24.98]How much money do I have?
[05:26.89]Where's my total money?
[05:27.65]$9,700.
[05:27.91]You got to start very slow.
[05:35.03]So I'm thinking hamburger stand, hamburger stand, ferris wheel.
[05:39.66]And then that's it and open it.
[05:44.08]Where are my rides?
[05:44.60]Where's my ride development?
[05:46.12]I know I have that somewhere.
[05:48.66]Here's rides.
[05:50.30]I'm thinking the choo-choo train.
[05:53.24]Slow.
[05:53.62]Slow.
[05:54.95]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[05:55.77]Just hear me out.
[05:56.65]I'm thinking the monorail around the entire park.
[06:03.16]Is it R to switch?
[06:04.50]No, no, no.
[06:04.68]No, stop.
[06:04.92]You know what I mean?
[06:07.34]Have the monorail go all the way around the whole thing.
[06:10.66]You'll get on this ride and it'll take like three hours.
[06:13.96]You can see everything.
[06:17.40]So let's go ahead and get this made.
[06:18.52]I want to flip it this way.
[06:24.92]So to know, actually it should be like this because then I can have it be going all the way around.
[06:29.04]Alright.
[06:33.59]Let's go like this forward.
[06:37.11]Okay.
[06:39.37]Alright.
[06:44.83]That looks alright.
[06:45.91]Now let's go ahead and start building the track.
[06:53.27]Oh, shit.
[06:55.60]I have to do the... Doesn't this cost a lot of money?
[07:00.50]This is insanely expensive from what I remember.
[07:06.98]How much is it going to cost?
[07:07.92]90 bucks?
[07:15.30]Oh, for the love of God, that's way too much money.
[07:18.60]I'm just going to cut it this way.
[07:30.66]I'm going to use this as the edge here.
[07:31.90]Alright, can I cut it now?
[07:42.15]Let's see.
[07:46.35]Let's go forward one right here.
[07:49.09]Okay, let's see.
[07:49.47]Can I cut it?
[07:49.95]I think so.
[07:51.21]Yep.
[07:53.63]Alright, we're good.
[08:03.26]Alright.
[08:03.62]How much is this?
[08:04.26]$157 per?
[08:04.50]No, keep going up a little more.
[08:18.57]No, back it up.
[08:22.03]What's the point of a monorail?
[08:23.13]I don't think there is one.
[08:29.16]No, go back, back up.
[08:29.92]I have to back this up.
[08:35.02]I turned a little.
[08:35.66]No, I didn't.
[08:36.02]That's alright.
[08:36.38]Alright, it doesn't need to be exact.
[08:55.52]Just like, it has to be close enough.
[09:10.57]This is a big park.
[09:15.45]I don't think this is... I'm going to run out of money before I do this.
[09:23.36]Okay.
[09:25.62]Let's go... Let's close it.
[09:28.82]This is not a roller coaster.
[09:29.90]This is just a... You can ride around and view the park.
[09:33.10]How many miles is this?
[09:36.63]Take out the loans?
[09:37.35]No, no, no.
[09:37.73]We'll keep this here.
[09:41.49]I'm going to build out this way first.
[09:44.59]This is a huge park.
[09:46.29]Big, big, big, big park.
[09:47.53]It's okay.
[09:59.39]This will work out.
[10:05.63]Actually, this is not bad because this will be my area to build.
[10:28.97]It needs to go up.
[10:34.12]Oh, fuck off, come on.
[11:00.34]Why?
[11:04.48]Oh, yeah.
[11:07.66]The monorail is sitting on the ground.
[11:15.57]Yeah, that's right.
[11:16.69]It is just on the ground.
[11:17.81]How are you going to see everything?
[11:20.45]It's just a slow moving car on a track.
[11:24.09]It's alright.
[11:24.61]People will like it.
[11:25.29]The kids, it's for the kids.
[11:27.38]The kids will love this shit.
[11:55.68]I was always so bad at trying to do this shit.
[12:01.11]Because you gotta match it up.
[13:08.35]I can do better anyways.
[13:47.80]Alright, so... I'm going to go like this.
[13:56.61]That's a good start.
[14:00.99]No monorail.
[14:01.87]I'm not doing the monorail.
[14:02.95]It's like... We're going to start easy.
[14:06.99]We're going to start with the Ferris wheel.
[14:09.09]You start with the Ferris wheel every time.
[14:13.96]Or the maze.
[14:14.44]This one's fun.
[14:16.73]No, no, no.
[14:17.03]I need like an information center first.
[14:20.31]Okay, we've got funnel cakes, hot dog stall.
[14:24.47]Where's like the info center?
[14:26.13]And balloons.
[14:26.83]Yeah, bathroom.
[14:27.77]Not yet.
[14:29.11]Let's put ATMs.
[14:30.75]These are important here.
[14:33.25]ATM here.
[14:37.11]Go ahead and open it.
[14:39.97]Okay.
[14:41.77]Let's get another ATM.
[14:49.36]go ahead and open it is it already open they're both open good alright it's off center it's fine I can it doesn't matter it's un why why is there no music yeah this is supposed to be music in this game
[15:19.84]What's going on?
[15:20.60]Guests can't get to the entrance of Cache Machine 1.
[15:23.16]Yeah, the park's not open.
[15:24.10]I don't understand.
[15:31.51]What do they... How do you move shit around?
[15:42.25]Can I not pick it up?
[15:50.52]Spin it this way.
[15:53.32]It's because the lip wasn't there.
[15:54.84]Alright.
[15:55.10]Alright, so let's open it up.
[15:58.47]Now we're going to have a small ride here.
[16:00.29]Should I do food?
[16:06.51]Yeah, let's do burgers.
[16:11.81]Food right at the entrance.
[16:16.95]No, I'm not going to rebuild the monorail.
[16:18.35]That turned into a disaster.
[16:21.53]Food right at the entrance.
[16:22.55]Anytime that I go to a place like a Six Flags, I always want food right at the front door.
[16:30.15]We're going here.
[16:31.11]Right at the front door.
[16:33.39]Burger price.
[16:34.37]Make it same throughout the park.
[16:36.11]Profit per item.
[16:37.13]It's going to be $1.60.
[16:37.93]Remember, this is like 1994 prices.
[16:42.12]So you're probably like, what the fuck are you talking about, man?
[16:44.44]It should be $6.
[16:45.18]No, $1.60.
[16:45.44]This is back in the fucking 30s.
[16:50.14]Let's get, uh... Let's get two birds.
[16:52.76]No, we got a variety.
[16:58.43]Put on the Animal Crossing OST.
[16:59.83]You got it.
[17:04.49]How do I, like, pause this?
[17:15.43]Animal Crossing soundtrack collection.
[17:17.03]Complete edition.
[17:19.23]Alright.
[17:21.84]Get comfortable.
[17:23.34]Because this is gonna be a real snooze.
[17:25.76]That's not a way you should describe your livestream.
[17:35.13]There we are.
[17:36.27]Just sit in the background.
[17:39.05]Get under the covers, you know?
[17:42.05]Wait, isn't it like 4 o'clock in the afternoon?
[17:50.04]Alright, go to bed if you're like 78.
[17:51.60]Okay, here we go.
[17:55.52]So we got the burger stand.
[17:56.86]Let's go with a... French fries right next to it.
[18:04.25]What do you say?
[18:06.87]The game's paused.
[18:10.18]How much are the french fries?
[18:12.52]Same price they're at the park.
[18:13.46]Let's make them $1.40.
[18:14.58]Make them a little cheaper.
[18:21.26]There we go.
[18:23.46]So we got burgers, fries.
[18:25.72]What the hell else are we gonna do here?
[18:27.00]How about a pretzel stall?
[18:28.14]Yeah, that's a good snack.
[18:32.18]Pretzels would be a little cheaper.
[18:34.15]Lot of people.
[18:34.63]We got a lot of foot traffic here.
[18:38.37]Make them 90 cents.
[18:39.11]Okay, let's... I think we need drinks too.
[18:46.51]How could we forget lemonade?
[18:51.97]Uh, lemonade price.
[18:52.93]$1.20, make it the same throughout the park.
[19:01.91]$1.40.
[19:04.31]What I should do is I should make, I should have no drinks and just scream on a big intercom, hold a cup outside.
[19:11.51]It's free.
[19:20.50]Uh, we'll do a soda as well.
[19:26.78]Is this SpongeBob music or is this... No, no, that's too clustered.
[19:31.76]Too clustered.
[19:32.28]I don't want to do that.
[19:32.80]We need a ride.
[19:35.00]We're doing a nice, relaxing, easy ride.
[19:37.30]We're doing an intro Ferris wheel right here.
[19:45.37]The line doesn't have to be very long.
[19:46.57]Although, these ones always have a ton of people that care about them.
[19:49.35]For some dumb reason.
[19:56.82]This is the entrance, right?
[19:59.30]And then here's the exit.
[20:00.30]Alright.
[20:01.56]So, uh, Ferris wheel.
[20:02.79]Okay.
[20:05.05]Forward rotation.
[20:05.69]Number of rotations.
[20:08.07]One.
[20:09.43]Reliability.
[20:10.21]Inspection time.
[20:11.05]Every 30 minutes is fine.
[20:13.82]I want it to be, uh... We gotta have a central theme here.
[20:20.01]Ice.
[20:20.53]No.
[20:21.77]Space.
[20:22.39]No.
[20:23.89]Plane.
[20:27.09]What's wrong with one rotation?
[20:28.27]It goes around once.
[20:29.15]It takes like 25 minutes.
[20:31.71]The theme should be pretzel.
[20:36.01]I don't think I can do a pretzel theme.
[20:38.51]Gravy?
[20:39.19]No, that's castle.
[20:41.79]How am I gonna do pretzel themed?
[20:45.15]I mean, the log cabin?
[20:46.31]Should it... Alright, let's... We're doing... This is a pretzel park.
[20:54.56]Log cabins.
[20:57.70]Alright, that's fine.
[20:58.68]It's really... It's very ugly, but it's okay.
[21:05.62]Okay, admission price, it's free.
[21:07.88]Or should it be like 5 cents?
[21:09.10]No.
[21:11.55]Okay, that's fine.
[21:13.91]It is now ready to test.
[21:16.12]I need to get a queue in there.
[21:19.92]Just go with the standard queue.
[21:21.04]That's fine.
[21:26.08]I'm one of those people that doesn't like to have the queue be... I like having a clean exit.
[21:30.95]Not the queue exit.
[21:34.43]Am I charging?
[21:35.07]Yeah, I'm charging for admission.
[21:37.87]Alright.
[21:38.49]So far, so good.
[21:39.89]Two bathrooms?
[21:41.29]No, those are ATMs.
[21:46.47]That'll be tested to be ready to go.
[21:47.71]I need staff, too, right?
[21:49.35]Yeah.
[21:49.69]I need a handyman.
[21:52.71]No, I don't.
[21:53.11]Not yet.
[21:54.69]One mechanic.
[21:56.36]Okay, I need the entertainer.
[21:57.54]Those are important to have, like, just sitting right here.
[21:59.64]Where'd he go?
[22:01.20]Alright, you go here.
[22:03.26]Is it knight?
[22:05.51]Roman costume?
[22:06.37]No, no, no, no, no.
[22:07.25]Astronaut.
[22:09.73]$55 a month.
[22:11.47]That's... Alright, that's really, really, really low.
[22:14.99]I want you to be in this area here.
[22:21.08]Do not go anywhere else.
[22:22.36]Just stay at the front door.
[22:24.16]Thank you.
[22:26.58]That's his path.
[22:31.48]I'm walking around.
[22:32.22]Alright, I need to know... Should I open the park with one ride?
[22:35.74]I have to start making money.
[22:40.80]We have an astronaut, a ferris wheel, and food.
[22:46.36]Okay.
[22:48.70]Should I make the park like a dollar?
[22:50.16]This is not even worth going to.
[22:56.35]Five dollars.
[23:00.63]No, no, no, not yet.
[23:01.49]No, no, no, no.
[23:02.17]I gotta make two more rides.
[23:03.81]I'm not gonna get... No, no, no, no.
[23:05.35]Not gonna happen.
[23:05.89]Here we go.
[23:09.78]This one.
[23:10.62]Oh, I love this one.
[23:14.12]Custom design.
[23:15.37]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:19.15]This is a lot of money.
[23:20.65]No, I can do it.
[23:21.13]I'm going to do custom design here.
[23:23.29]I'm going over here.
[23:28.68]One, two, three.
[23:29.52]That's fine.
[23:31.48]Let's get it started.
[23:32.16]I'm going to go up.
[23:36.79]With a chain?
[23:38.17]Can it even do it?
[23:40.05]Special.
[23:41.03]Station platform.
[23:41.87]Spinning tunnel.
[23:43.23]Oh, yeah.
[23:44.11]Look at this.
[23:44.99]This is like some cartoon shit here.
[23:55.49]Okay.
[24:00.43]Station platform.
[24:02.65]No, I don't need that.
[24:03.21]I don't want it to be that long.
[24:16.62]I'm gonna go spin up and then come back around.
[24:20.70]Why is this a puke ride?
[24:21.59]No, it's not.
[24:21.97]I'm making it very easy.
[24:22.75]Is that as high as I can go?
[25:09.08]Not just a circle.
[25:10.56]Pog.
[25:11.70]Champ.
[25:13.85]What's going on?
[25:15.07]New ride attraction.
[25:16.03]Steel twister.
[25:16.63]You got it.
[25:17.23]What is this design?
[25:21.89]This is interesting.
[25:24.77]What a way to describe it.
[25:26.37]It's very interesting, isn't it?
[25:27.55]Let's get this back to ground level.
[25:42.11]Fucking nailed it.
[25:45.44]Let's test it out.
[25:47.22]Test.
[25:52.52]How many cars?
[25:53.30]No, this is... No, no, no.
[25:54.30]I want to test this.
[25:56.31]Alright.

[26:01.85]Not yet built.
[26:02.55]Oh, get out of here.
[26:05.23]Entrance is right here.
[26:06.25]Exit's going to wrap.
[26:06.99]It's going to be a very popular ride, so the exit's going to be this way.
[26:10.62]Okay, test it.
[26:11.94]That's a lot of cars.
[26:17.43]Nice.
[26:17.93]Then you get like, it gets all spooky in here.
[26:36.20]Why is this so slow?
[26:41.02]This is too slow!
[26:49.70]There's no dro- That's supposed to be a drop!
[26:57.59]Sports car, vintage car.
[27:01.01]No, make it cats.
[27:03.59]Continuous circuit.
[27:05.19]Wait for a full load- Don't wait for a full load.
[27:10.15]Alright, main color scheme.
[27:11.15]Let's go... Let's see, what do I want to do?
[27:14.57]Alright, let's make this like... I don't like the red.
[27:26.72]That's not bad.
[27:27.36]Oh, it's going to be pretzel related, right?
[27:28.66]I'm going to step in and say I'm not doing that.
[27:48.78]I'll be able to say different colors per car.
[27:51.34]Car one.
[27:53.02]No, no, no.
[27:54.80]Car 20.
[27:55.46]No, no, no, no, no, no.

[28:18.39]How much?
[28:19.07]Five miles per hour?
[28:20.76]Admission price is free.
[28:21.90]Alright.
[28:22.50]So now we got that there.
[28:23.90]I gotta get, I gotta add some, some, some lush vegetation.
[28:32.41]How many, how many, how do we get rid of the cars?
[28:34.81]Not, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:36.45]Okay.

[28:47.03]One, two, three, four.
[28:47.99]I'm gonna say seven.
[28:48.85]I'm gonna say eight.
[28:49.33]Let's test that one out.
[28:51.93]That's better.
[28:54.76]Can I make it faster?
[29:01.48]I can't make it faster.
[29:04.06]Alright, so that's ready.
[29:08.61]Why is my park for babies?
[29:11.80]Do you see how much space I have here?
[29:15.44]I need money before I can- I only have 5400 bucks.
[29:21.48]You have the cheap cheesy rides at the front.
[29:25.02]And then like the real daredevils have to go around back here.
[29:28.60]You don't want to have your kids walking all around.
[29:32.48]You got them in like strollers and stuff.
[29:34.20]No, you have all this stuff really close to the food.
[29:36.69]To the ATMs and the bathrooms.
[29:43.12]Don't you understand?
[29:43.80]Alright, so that one's good.
[29:45.94]Let's get a... Let's get the key on it.

[33:21.21]Actually, let me get some seating here.
[33:27.37]Seating in front of the ATM.
[33:31.52]You gotta have seats.
[33:32.10]And trash cans, too.
[33:34.40]Next to all the food stalls.
[33:35.54]I remember that was very important in this video game.
[33:38.62]Trash, trash, trash.
[33:39.88]Have a place to throw your trash.
[33:43.20]Alright, it's coming together pretty well.
[33:45.90]I think.
[33:47.52]This is a fun little ride.
[33:48.71]I got my little secret, like, garden area.
[33:51.63]Let's get a tree over here.
[33:52.53]I don't know, like, a couple of trees?
[33:58.33]No, I don't like those.
[33:59.19]I need small- I want bushes.
[34:00.43]Little ones.
[34:10.36]No.
[34:11.26]Don't like that either.
[34:11.86]I don't even need anything over there.
[34:20.74]Nah, I can put stores and stuff.
[34:21.99]Don't need it.
[34:24.17]Alright, so I got two rides.
[34:25.63]Here comes a good... Here comes a wild ride, alright?
[34:28.35]We're gonna do something fun.

[34:40.65]And this one's cool.
[34:44.25]Yeah.
[34:45.43]Automobile antics.

[34:51.94]What do you mean unavailable?
[34:58.44]Do these go fast?
[35:00.92]No, I already have a cart right there.
[35:02.32]I'm not doing another cart ride.
[35:04.60]We'll do the pirate ship.
[35:06.02]Everybody hates this.
[35:09.47]Give us the monorail.
[35:10.53]I don't have enough money to make that.
[35:12.03]What am I spending money on?
[35:13.19]Money's being deleted.
[35:18.87]I'll put this right here.
[35:26.19]Yeah.
[35:27.45]You want to talk about park design?
[35:30.31]Oh, shit.
[35:30.65]It's the wrong way.
[35:31.97]How do I flip it?
[36:10.00]How do I flip?
[36:22.51]I can get up there, right?
[36:26.19]Usually can't you just put your cursor and it does it right in front?
[36:28.01]It's an oil drill.
[36:34.20]Oh, okay, there we go.
[36:49.01]Damn it.
[36:55.24]It's okay.
[36:59.94]It's alright.

[46:49.17]People are starting to fill in here.
[46:50.09]81 people here.
[46:59.74]I told you this was going to be a good idea.
[47:02.16]This is not that cool, though.
[47:08.43]Has anybody been buying these?
[47:10.15]Zero per hour, burgers sold zero.
[47:15.83]Why?
[47:16.45]Is there a reason why?
[47:17.14]Too expensive?
[47:17.66]$1.40.
[47:18.34]$1.20.
[47:18.36]I mean, people have to start buying these.
[47:24.26]90 cents, it's fine.
[47:30.40]$20.
[47:30.42]What are you doing?
[47:34.94]Alright.

[47:41.67]Don't they usually say, this park has a big value?
[47:45.77]Park is really clean.
[47:46.57]I want something more thrilling.
[47:53.70]On Oopsy Daisy.
[47:54.54]Queuing for VR Sim.
[47:55.68]Walking, queuing for Oopsy Daisy.
[47:57.10]People really love the Oopsy Daisy.
[47:59.93]I should make two of these.
[48:00.65]Yeah, I'm just gonna make two of them back to back.
[48:32.57]Zen's Fortress.
[48:41.18]Fuck.
[48:41.62]I had it too.
[48:47.74]Turn this way, maybe?
[48:51.36]I think I can still do it.
[48:53.34]If I go like this, and then like that, and then can I turn it this way?
[49:00.57]Damn it.
[49:04.92]I can't just go that way with this.
[49:10.01]Wait, I can go that way.
[49:10.75]That's not going to do it.
[49:13.17]I don't think that's going to work though.
[49:15.81]Paul's there.
[49:40.45]Okay, hold on.
[49:41.19]Done.
[49:43.43]Alright.
[49:44.19]Alright.
[49:44.41]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:45.35]Hold on.
[49:59.17]Now this is actually kind of damn cool, I will say for myself.
[50:04.09]Now just hold on a minute here.
[50:06.61]Look at this.
[50:07.79]Look at what I've done.
[50:09.01]Look at what I'm capable of.
[50:10.25]Come on.
[50:13.07]Now check this out.
[50:18.51]Now we've got to connect this in a very, very, in a convincing way.
[50:23.89]So I'm going to say we can go... We've got to go around here.
[50:27.31]And this is going to take us to the next part of the park.
[50:45.03]Yep.
[50:50.09]Nothing goes upside down?
[50:50.98]Okay, now, uh, just open it.
[50:55.32]Test it and open it.
[50:57.82]Should I make a third one?
[50:59.06]Should I make four of these just back to back to back right here?
[51:01.78]They can't hit each other, right?
[51:07.16]This one's going to swing for less time.
[51:08.38]Okay, let's do the same color scheme.
[51:13.65]Looking good.
[51:26.49]Just open it.
[51:27.09]It's fine.
[51:29.59]There it is.
[51:29.97]What was this called?
[51:30.53]Oopsie-daisy?
[51:33.82]Whoopsie Daisy.
[51:35.02]They gotta have a similar name because they're right next to each other.
[51:38.84]Whoopsie Daisy and... Whoopsie... Whoopsie... Whoopsie Daisy and Whoopsie Daisy?
[51:55.34]Whatever.
[51:55.92]Alright.
[51:56.30]That's done.
[51:57.54]Now that's kind of cool.
[52:01.42]That's an attraction if I've ever seen one before.
[52:05.35]And this one can hold way more people than this one.
[52:07.37]See, this is what they don't understand.
[52:09.07]This ride is faster than this one.
[52:12.09]This one's longer with a shorter line.
[52:13.91]This one's faster with a longer line.
[52:19.92]Now, I got 2,300 bucks.
[52:21.48]What do I want to do now with this?
[52:26.90]I want to go out here.
[52:37.84]I got 191 people here.
[52:39.06]I need to charge more money.
[52:41.66]Because I'm not making anything.
[52:45.10]15.
[52:49.34]Turn down the crowd volume.
[52:50.84]Is it too loud?
[52:53.30]This is really starting to fill up.
[52:54.26]Everyone's realizing what's going on here.
[52:55.54]Alright.
[52:59.32]Do I have enough to do anything?

[53:10.55]Crazy crabs.
[53:12.73]5,000.
[53:14.85]What if I do... I need to save this because I'm going to try to just do one that goes up, down really hard and then rips around his ends.
[53:20.31]Let's save it as...
[53:30.21]Autosave.
[53:31.39]I guess it's just autosaving.
[53:32.43]That's alright.
[53:32.83]Alright, it's autosaving.
[53:40.52]Look at how fucking huge this line is.
[53:42.26]Alright, here's the diabolical plan.

[54:59.28]What if I just do one car?
[55:00.62]I can delete this.
[55:01.22]I can sell it later.

[61:53.04]Okay.
[62:00.79]And go.
[62:05.02]Welcome to the ride.
[62:05.74]I'm going to call this one... Whatever the name of that level is.

[62:21.39]This is perfect.
[62:21.93]They're already just getting in there, piling in.
[62:27.61]I told you this had to be done like this.

[63:50.96]Alright, let's go this way with the park.
[64:04.46]What's wrong with you?
[64:08.45]This is going to be an impossible ride to fill up.
[64:12.72]Alright, what have I got?
[64:14.48]4,000?
[64:14.50]I'm turning a profit.
[64:20.88]I'm going to say we should do something else.
[64:24.90]Like a little... What's the word I got for research?
[64:29.08]Vertical shuttle cars.
[64:30.30]No, I don't want to do that.
[64:34.30]I want to focus on...
[64:37.22]No shops and sceneries.
[64:38.82]No water rides.
[64:41.18]No gentle rides.
[64:42.68]Thrill rides and roller coasters.
[64:44.31]And shops.
[64:46.97]Marketing campaign.
[64:47.67]We're going to do a marketing campaign for a ride.
[64:57.55]I need another one of these.
[64:58.39]They're getting too full.
[65:21.13]Is this gonna work?
[65:25.54]They're just gonna crash into each other.
[65:45.03]Give the people what they want.
[65:48.33]You know, I agree.
[65:49.43]Which way does he have to be facing?
[66:08.67]Alright.
[66:10.47]Look, if they want to ride it, just look at how big of a line this is.
[66:13.42]It's ridiculous.
[66:21.67]Alright, I need this.
[66:48.44]VR sim is what's wrong with it?
[67:22.86]No, fuck.
[67:23.86]I want this.

[68:53.77]Where?
[68:57.01]I wanna go home.
[68:58.43]Who?
[69:02.59]You can find your way outta here.
[69:08.71]Look at all the people.
[69:10.23]I can't keep these lines empty.
[69:12.27]It's because I separated the roads.
[69:24.56]Yeah, they're... Wait a minute.
[69:27.56]This is fucked up.
[69:30.36]Hold on.
[69:30.64]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[69:33.58]I didn't want it like this.
[69:42.07]There we go.

[70:18.58]Another janitor.
[70:22.54]Somewhere.
[70:22.86]I'm going to have to have you patrol over here.
[70:24.54]Because it's dirty.
[70:26.99]It's fucking dirty over here.
[70:29.83]You need to be like around here.
[70:31.25]This area.
[70:35.05]That's where you go.
[70:35.87]Still raining?
[70:40.22]Still raining?
[70:45.77]I need more barrels, too.
[70:49.21]Just keep it at 20.
[70:51.59]What if somebody wants to buy one, though?
[70:52.75]Like, randomly, just to buy one.
[70:54.05]They're not going to come for a buy one unless there's a reason.
[71:00.41]$10,000 an hour.
[71:00.63]Wouldn't that be nice?
[71:16.21]Look at how popular this one is.
[71:19.51]What's wrong with this?
[71:22.11]Why is nobody on the line for this one?
[71:26.10]What's going on here?
[71:31.22]What's wrong?
[71:31.74]Does nobody want to ride this one?
[71:34.73]I'm not going on Pirate Ship 1 while it's raining.
[71:37.67]Okay.
[71:38.81]Pirate Ship 1.
[71:39.35]Excuse me.
[71:51.59]Luigi's circuit has broken down.
[71:55.83]How?
[71:57.73]Wait.
[71:58.51]Are the people still on it?
[72:05.64]What?
[72:05.82]I need an engineer.
[72:06.50]Why are the people still riding this?
[72:12.02]There he comes.
[72:12.48]Alright, good.
[72:17.58]I need one more, uh, one more engineer.
[72:22.37]And a security guard.
[72:23.89]Okay.
[72:25.63]And barrels.
[72:35.38]And more shops.
[72:37.24]Yeah.
[72:38.12]I need more shops.
[72:38.78]I need more benches.
[72:39.40]Let's get some more stores.
[72:46.04]I want a fountain.
[72:47.96]A giant ice cube.
[72:50.27]Uh, yeah, like right here.
[72:51.25]Cool.
[72:52.07]That's kind of cool.
[72:55.63]That's cool, just to look at.
[72:56.65]Um, wait a minute.
[73:32.49]This is too cramped.
[73:33.85]I don't like it.
[73:34.79]I don't like it.
[73:40.11]It's too cramped.
[73:40.91]Can I get rid of it?
[73:44.70]I don't think I can get rid of it.
[73:51.62]Does it cost money to look at the ice cube?
[73:58.00]Have I ever crapped my pants at an amusement park?
[74:01.46]No.
[74:05.50]Okay, there it goes.
[74:07.33]I now have enough money to make another coaster.
[74:09.75]And the next coaster is going to cross across this one.
[74:14.27]You know what I'm saying?
[74:22.88]This one's going to be... ...fucked.
[74:33.12]Reverse free fall coaster.
[74:34.24]Check this out.
[74:35.01]Yep.
[74:35.89]How much is this?
[74:37.21]$4,000?
[74:37.23]$3,900?
[74:37.91]Now this is going to be... That's pretty cool.
[74:50.45]Coaster inside of the coaster.
[75:05.42]That doesn't crash, right?
[75:08.93]OK.
[75:09.20]Yeah, it's fine.
[75:10.24]Alright.
[75:10.48]We've got to change the...
[75:40.47]What's with the red platform?
[75:46.30]Okay.
[75:48.84]Reverse free fall car.
[75:51.52]Full load.
[75:53.94]Alright.
[75:54.60]I can't do anything else.
[75:55.65]That looks good.
[75:56.37]I wish I could change the color of that.
[76:01.49]Can I?
[76:01.85]Let's give it a test.
[76:14.85]Nice.
[76:15.75]Alright.
[76:25.35]Put more speed on it.
[76:26.47]I don't think I can.
[76:28.65]No, it's already very intense.
[76:31.44]This thing goes up to 70 miles per hour.
[76:35.38]Make it taller.
[76:39.70]Hold on.
[76:47.54]That's too high.
[76:48.22]That's way too high.
[76:50.52]Is that too much?
[77:06.99]That's like a test of strength.
[77:08.31]It doesn't even go up halfway.
[77:13.74]How do I make it go faster?
[77:20.15]I need to increase the power?
[77:21.38]How do I do that?
[77:29.79]Close it.
[77:37.51]Is it like this thing back here?
[77:47.26]It gains speed from the straight track pieces.
[77:49.64]It's the gear tab of the ride.
[77:54.78]Yeah, but I was just... No, it's not.
[77:57.16]I can't do that.
[78:00.49]Do you want to refurbish force mine?
[78:02.83]No.
[78:03.29]Yeah, it's not there.
[78:08.99]The other gear?
[78:13.26]Yeah, it's in here.
[78:20.58]Uh, I think I have to make more of these sections.
[78:30.06]So... I need to go like this then.
[78:33.74]I should have just made this myself!
[78:38.59]What a waste of money.
[79:03.73]Better?
[79:09.85]Let's try it.
[79:24.90]No!
[79:32.85]It's gonna have to do.
[79:36.69]I can take it down one, two, three.
[79:48.44]Now that's a real scary ride.
[79:53.66]Just this.
[79:56.20]I want it to be like you're just about to go over and like fly off the ride.
[80:01.68]Just barely one more.
[80:03.28]Make it like, holy shit, it's going over the thing.
[80:08.96]Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[80:10.52]Let's see if it works.
[80:21.22]The name of this ride is going to be called Just Barely.
[80:27.32]Just barely.
[80:28.74]Just barely.
[80:39.42]Any more force and you're off.
[80:42.30]Bumper to bumper broke down?
[80:45.92]What even is bumper to bumper?
[80:47.54]Oh, the thing underneath this mess.
[80:50.10]How does this break down?
[80:52.16]Now this thing's ready to go.
[80:58.45]Okay, let's get that car.
[81:03.03]Cool.
[81:04.99]The color scheme's gotta be different.
[81:08.39]It's gonna be orange.
[81:10.23]Orange cars to make it match with this.
[81:13.15]This track is wrong.
[81:15.06]That's better.
[81:16.88]Actually, I kind of like the orange.
[81:18.46]I like the orange.
[81:20.14]Yeah, it works with this.
[81:26.62]Nice.
[81:32.35]Cool.
[81:34.17]What's the intensity, bro?
[81:34.79]What do I get for rating?
[81:36.21]Very high.
[81:37.05]Yeah.
[81:37.41]Good luck on that one.
[81:42.21]You want intense?
[81:44.13]I'll give you intense.
[81:45.01]Alright.
[81:48.21]I think I need to... That's better.
[82:00.44]This is getting a little loud.
[82:07.65]I think it's ready to open as soon as we make the kiosks.
[82:13.79]Wait.
[82:19.75]How the hell do you get up and down and out of here?
[82:36.79]Make stairs going to here?
[82:42.37]The path in the back.
[82:43.39]Oh, OK.
[82:47.34]This way.
[82:50.16]Ah.
[82:51.38]Ah.
[82:51.64]It's facing the wrong way.
[82:56.56]Because you go in here and go, that's the line.
[83:02.45]So then I this up.
[83:03.49]It's OK.
[83:07.58]No, no, I hate that look.
[83:10.06]Gotta be consistent.
[83:14.28]Alright.
[83:15.32]Okay, alright.
[83:19.92]Now, I'm going to connect this.
[83:27.60]The VR sim has broken down like three times.
[83:30.96]This needs to be connected over here, so we're going to build out.
[83:34.40]I think I'm going to go from here.
[83:38.35]Yeah.
[83:38.59]Let's build up from there.
[83:46.47]I'm gonna make this a double sidewalk.
[83:50.61]Triple sidewalk.
[83:51.34]Because this is ugly.
[83:56.22]This is very, very, very ugly.
[83:59.68]What have I just done?
[84:01.44]What'd I do?
[84:02.06]What'd I do?
[84:02.40]What'd I do?
[84:02.74]What'd I do?
[84:03.82]Oh, okay.
[84:04.50]Well... Please replace that.
[84:09.99]Alright, so that's ugly.
[84:10.99]Let's go up this way with it.
[84:18.20]I know everyone's gonna freak out.
[84:19.22]I got it.
[84:19.46]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, therefore 7.
[84:20.92]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 is the middle.
[84:22.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[84:22.52]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[84:39.89]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[84:40.57]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[84:40.85]Got it.
[85:21.12]I'm going to have a big display here.
[85:28.48]That's going to be another section of the park over this way.
[85:43.23]You can find it.
[85:43.83]Get back over here.
[85:44.47]You can't be that stupid.
[85:48.01]Okay, good.
[85:50.51]Open it.
[85:55.59]Here we go.
[86:02.56]I'm gonna put some attraction.
[86:03.72]How much money do I have?
[86:05.10]Make this more expensive.
[86:10.76]$40 to get in this fucking park.
[86:15.02]We have to see what they think.
[86:17.86]Already getting loaded up.
[86:20.76]Is it too intense?
[86:21.42]No, people are getting on.
[86:26.40]Caught that sneeze.
[86:33.80]Just barely is too intense.
[86:35.66]Just looking at it just barely makes me feel sick.
[86:41.52]People are getting on.
[86:42.19]Here we go.
[86:47.79]Whoa.
[86:52.47]That was intense.
[86:59.49]I need, uh, bark bags out here.
[87:15.36]Click on the main gates?
[87:18.66]What about it?
[87:22.87]Park Rating.
[87:23.27]Oh, look at this park rating!
[87:24.91]People love this place.
[87:35.17]Alright, looking good.
[87:37.37]Now, I need to get some money.
[87:39.66]I have to make money.
[87:41.26]Let's increase some scenery over here because this looks terrible.
[87:53.31]Get some fences.
[87:55.85]Let's get a fence.
[87:58.59]Let's do this fence.
[88:00.09]This is a big fence.
[88:04.68]Looks good to me.
[88:06.74]Alright.
[88:16.59]And then I'm gonna put... Let's close off this area.
[88:22.21]Rotodrop is now available.
[88:23.39]Let's go... Let's make like a little nice garden for people to puke on.
[88:44.38]Put on the new leaf soundtrack.
[88:48.04]In due time.
[88:48.48]Okay, that looks alright.
[88:53.89]Now let's get some bushes.
[88:55.65]Some trees and bushes.
[88:56.95]Maybe let's just do flowers.
[89:00.63]I'm just gonna do purple.
[89:02.53]Yeah.
[89:04.75]Watch this.
[89:10.37]In groups of three.
[89:11.15]One, two, three.
[89:12.05]And then I'm gonna do space, space.
[89:17.13]Yes, space, space, and then... Three spaces.
[89:22.63]Yellow, I guess.
[89:23.33]Okay.
[89:23.55]And then I'm gonna do the same thing.
[89:33.62]Space, space, and then space right there.
[89:42.37]We're gonna go 1, 2, 3, and go again.
[89:58.03]Alright, now I'm gonna do... Um... How do these look?
[90:05.13]These are, like, evil.
[90:08.15]I don't want those.
[90:10.35]Uh...
[90:12.42]How about a... How about these?
[90:18.08]No.
[90:20.59]Bushes.
[90:21.09]There we are.
[90:21.69]That's what I want.
[90:22.17]I want these fluffy ones.
[90:27.29]Hmm.
[90:37.86]No, I want like a tree.
[90:39.62]There we go.
[90:41.04]These.
[90:41.60]That's what I was looking for.
[90:42.54]Okay.
[90:59.37]Now I'm going to do the same thing over here.
[91:01.39]I'm going to add a couple things in here, though.
[91:18.21]I fucked it up?
[91:19.75]Wrong.
[91:20.03]What do you mean wrong?
[91:20.59]I fucked it up?
[91:22.89]Wrong.
[91:23.71]Wrong.
[91:24.41]Wrong.
[91:24.96]How is it wrong?
[91:32.88]Space?
[91:33.52]Space?
[91:34.14]Oh, right.
[91:34.74]Okay, hold on.
[91:35.76]I'm going to change it up, though.
[91:36.54]Let's change it up.
[91:37.32]Let's do red.
[91:39.52]And let's do pink and... Let's do pink and red.
[91:45.85]Let's do pink over here.
[91:46.73]I don't know.
[91:57.20]Keep it symmetrical.
[91:58.08]Didn't people scream in my face when I did symmetrical?
[92:01.04]Just barely broke down.
[92:02.04]People lined up to do this.
[92:08.93]What do you mean it broke down?
[92:10.27]Where?
[92:15.11]I had people screaming in my face.
[92:16.96]Because I was doing a symmetrical garden.
[92:19.58]And now all of a sudden, you want a symmetrical garden?
[92:21.14]One, two, three.
[92:23.16]One, two...
[92:32.86]What is this?
[92:33.32]Is that Chrono Trigger?
[92:38.48]Space, space, space.
[93:00.67]Nice.
[93:02.35]Yellow again.
[93:03.85]Alright, that's... See, now I did it.
[93:14.95]I don't like the way this looks, though.
[93:34.35]What's going on here?
[93:36.71]What happened?
[93:37.65]This looks completely wrong.
[93:39.26]Oh, it's because they're in the middle.
[93:42.40]They're in the middle.
[93:55.95]Okay.
[93:58.77]Now we're going to do a little thing in the middle, I think, is what I want to do.
[94:06.29]Just a little thing.
[94:07.72]Small.
[94:08.16]Oh.
[94:08.24]Cool.
[94:34.83]A duck in one of them.
[94:36.16]Yeah.
[94:40.88]The duck at the end.
[94:42.79]Two ducks.
[94:47.45]No, double duck through the whole thing.
[94:56.40]That looks great.
[94:56.94]I like it.
[95:05.75]Alright, that makes it look a little better, I think.
[95:10.13]Maybe we should add, like, a statue or something.
[95:17.19]Double wall.
[95:19.37]Is this Abe Lincoln?
[95:20.65]Who's this?
[95:21.03]I don't know.
[95:21.53]What is that?
[95:23.26]Oh, it's Egyptian, OK.
[95:24.92]Bump it, bump it, broke down.
[95:25.86]Alright, do I have enough money?
[95:28.16]I only have $522.
[95:28.58]How did that happen?
[95:35.17]Where did my money go?
[95:41.41]Money catches.
[95:42.03]People can enjoy sitting around here.
[95:57.60]And we're going to put a soda machine over here.
[96:04.08]I think that works.
[96:07.16]Ice cold drinks?
[96:09.16]Ice cold pretzels?
[96:10.00]What do you mean?
[96:14.03]You think a double water fountain?
[96:15.09]I'll just sell these and put them over here.
[96:18.27]Yeah, I need ice cold first aid.
[96:21.33]There's my information center.
[96:22.43]How much are these?
[96:26.12]Alright, where's the drinks?
[96:29.17]Hot dog.
[96:30.45]Broody what?
[96:37.23]Chicken?
[96:37.75]There it is.
[96:38.91]Your park has received an award for being the safest park in the country.
[96:41.95]Oh, it's Slider!
[97:00.84]You know, K.K.
[97:01.94]Slaughter, to me, is what I would think it would sound like if a bug sang.
[97:07.24]Imagine you just heard this muffled through the wall and you went in and there was like a beetle just swaying back and forth.
[97:14.11]That's what I picture.
[97:23.92]I'll do drinks and we'll do food over here, too.
[97:28.13]Hot dogs, yeah.
[97:28.87]Hot dogs and just a couple of drinks.
[97:34.79]KKS Live is one of the most modern pop music.
[97:57.44]Oh, shit, a bug!
[98:05.99]So, uh... Chicken, too?
[98:14.90]I'm gonna go...
[98:27.56]Lemonade.
[98:29.20]I need a first aid room.
[98:29.98]I really do.
[98:37.89]Where should I put it, though?
[98:38.61]I don't like the symmetry over here.
[98:42.19]First aid should probably be in front of the rides that are the most dangerous.
[98:50.37]What do you guys think?
[98:58.15]Yeah, let's put it over here.
[99:00.62]Is first aid free?
[99:04.76]I guess, yeah.
[99:06.62]It's just available in case somebody pukes.
[99:12.45]Imagine going to a roller coaster and right outside the entrance is a medical tent.
[99:20.07]Yeah, that's actually pretty scary.
[99:26.69]F wheels broken down.
[99:27.75]Uh-oh.
[99:31.21]Is it time to liquidate this thing?
[99:32.57]This is not even the right color scheme.
[99:44.36]What am I thinking?
[99:51.52]Alright, I wanted the fountains over here.
[100:00.89]Can I get it?
[100:01.81]Can I pick it up?
[100:03.69]No, it's just in a weird spot.
[100:05.61]Why did I put these here?
[100:12.40]Got it.
[100:13.04]Alright.
[100:15.68]Can I get the other one?
[100:20.84]I'm pretty slick.
[100:24.16]People really like the ice cube.
[100:25.21]Hold on.
[100:25.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[100:26.29]Put more benches here.
[100:29.55]What an attraction.
[100:30.96]Everybody was supposed to sit in front of the ice cube.
[100:36.18]Right?
[100:36.44]Look at it.
[100:40.61]You got at least two, four, five, six people here.
[100:43.45]Should I do a second queue?
[100:50.58]Why not?
[100:50.94]That's $25.
[100:58.15]Alright, I wanted to put fountains here.
[101:01.43]Here and here?
[101:02.65]Maybe?
[101:02.93]The tornado's a little distracting.
[101:11.20]Ooh, I like- that's nice.
[101:13.32]Look at this go.
[102:16.25]Actually, I like it.
[102:22.31]Didn't go all the way.
[102:23.25]Oops.
[102:30.74]No, my garden!
[102:53.61]No, that's fine.
[102:55.75]What's this bug?
[102:57.23]Volcano?
[102:57.79]We gotta have some cool... We have to have things that go by, right?
[103:03.85]What are these?
[103:04.15]Are these fireworks?
[103:40.29]Okay.
[103:41.99]I need to stop spending money.
[103:49.90]Put on some music.
[103:50.72]Okay.
[103:51.62]What should I put on?
[103:58.35]I need some rain.
[103:59.35]I don't know.
[103:59.73]Come on.
[103:59.93]When's it gonna rain?
[104:04.45]Mario 3D World?
[104:15.66]Mario 3D World.
[104:17.66]Don't I hate this game?
[104:20.54]Which is the one that I don't like?
[104:28.19]Super Mario 3D World LST.

[105:34.11]Are they just standing in line?
[105:35.07]That's their problem?
[105:55.13]I'm not hungry.
[105:55.89]I've already got a cuddly toy.
[106:05.56]This park is really clean.
[106:06.56]I'm not thirsty.
[106:07.16]Whoops, Daisy.
[106:07.88]Whoops, Daisy was great.
[106:11.92]Okay.
[106:12.84]So, Luigi's Circuit is taking too long.
[106:16.07]I'm gonna make the... I'm sorry, I have to do this.
[106:18.27]This is gonna be bad, but I have to do it.
[106:21.05]Ladies and gentlemen, Luigi's Circuit is now closed.
[106:25.96]I'm gonna add a couple of cars here.
[107:35.93]Bingo.
[107:41.77]Six cars.
[107:43.71]How long is the ride?
[107:47.29]Max it.
[107:47.91]Leave if another train arrives at the station.
[107:49.57]Wait for... Okay.
[107:52.96]I think we're good.
[107:54.14]We've got more cars.
[107:55.06]I think that's good.
[108:01.60]I think it's good to go.
[108:04.76]Open it up.
[108:05.84]It's back open.
[108:06.56]We've got three extra cards.
[108:08.32]What do you mean, music?

[108:37.33]I don't know what this is.
[108:40.29]This is on the playlist.
[108:46.29]What?
[108:46.55]I don't know what this is!
[108:49.79]This is called Super Mario World OST Extended.
[108:52.21]How about, uh, Beat Block Skyway?
[109:00.96]That's next in line.
[109:07.42]It's the same song!
[109:13.25]Hold on.
[109:13.53]Wait, wait, what's wrong?
[109:14.13]Why are people not going on the ride?
[109:15.23]Is this going faster?
[109:20.67]What's going on?
[109:21.18]People don't want to get on this ride anymore.
[109:22.34]Why not?
[109:29.72]I don't... What... Why do you guys think I know what, like, a porn song is?
[109:33.59]It's Mario 3D World.
[109:34.97]What are you talking about?
[109:43.18]OK.
[109:48.69]What's a relaxing one?
[109:51.03]Stardew?
[109:53.28]How about Dune?
[109:54.10]That sounds pretty good.
[110:43.58]Okay.
[110:48.89]Uh, I want to build another coaster, but I don't have any money.
[110:56.11]Should I make a fourth one of these?
[110:58.51]No.
[110:58.93]No one's even riding it.
[111:03.39]There we go.
[111:03.89]Now I have people waiting in line.
[111:06.09]Take out a loan?
[111:06.88]I hate doing that.
[111:13.43]I really hate taking out Lones.
[111:19.06]I'm actually, I'm not in the red.
[111:21.64]Lone.
[111:22.84]I can't.
[111:38.37]I gotta wait.
[111:42.88]This is freaking me out.
[111:44.64]I'm putting on fucking Mario RPG.
[111:54.74]There we go.
[112:01.81]Guests are complaining about the disgusting state of the park.
[112:03.69]What are you talking about?
[112:20.97]Okay, now I want to put the game sounds back up a little.
[112:23.47]Because I like to hear the little... That's a nice level.
[112:36.51]People are not shitting, alright?
[112:39.09]There's plenty of bathrooms.
[112:41.67]Do I need another janitor?
[112:47.01]Oh, it's this.
[112:48.46]Alright.
[112:49.02]There's a janitor that's doing this, isn't there?
[112:55.72]Where are you?
[113:00.03]Who's the one that has the path?
[113:07.21]It's you.
[113:08.39]What's your path?
[113:10.02]Oh, we'll add this to your path.
[113:19.58]This game is so good.
[113:20.32]Yeah, the guy doesn't have a path.
[113:21.40]Yeah, he can just wander.
[113:22.12]Alright, you take care of that.
[113:23.15]Link the front end here.
[113:49.29]still does what was that egg mean walking to egg oh no no he's an astronaut right okay I think it's time to change to a panda it looks good there we go close
[114:17.30]Would I ever stream it?
[114:18.26]I've beat this game probably, like, 40 times.
[114:20.74]I don't know if I'd be able to add very much.
[114:25.19]But... I have... We've talked about before.
[114:29.41]Who cares?
[114:30.41]Just kind of do it.
[114:33.99]Right?
[114:34.25]Alright.
[114:34.49]Hold on.
[114:34.89]I need some... I got 2,400 bucks.
[114:35.81]Can I fast forward?
[114:36.47]Time?
[114:36.59]You can do this?
[114:50.51]Can I just do this really fast until I can build a new coaster?
[114:53.21]Because I want to build a giant one.
[114:55.35]It's time for the monorail.
[114:58.10]I think it's time.
[115:01.38]Can you imagine?
[115:01.94]I was going to go around this whole thing with the monorail.
[115:07.96]It's time.
[115:09.75]Monorail.
[115:10.09]Or how about a choo-choo train?
[115:17.37]Elevator?
[115:30.43]It's got to be back.
[115:31.73]The path is going to be a path that leads down here to somewhere over here.
[115:37.21]And we go around this whole thing.
[115:40.80]I don't have to finish the whole thing right now.
[115:53.17]Yeah, this is the best soundtrack for any Mario game.
[115:57.84]I will hold that up.
[115:58.84]Track to track to any Mario game you've ever played.
[116:00.92]Alright, let's go back here.
[116:09.45]Now let's go up.
[116:10.13]Up, up, up, up, up.
[116:14.27]Up, up, up, up.
[116:15.47]Good.
[116:17.17]Wait.
[116:20.00]Okay.
[116:22.76]So they get a good view.
[116:23.98]No, that's not necessary.
[116:26.14]Just go around the whole thing.
[116:28.14]Here's the intro.
[116:47.97]Go around.
[116:50.35]I'm almost out of money.
[116:51.97]I don't have to finish you yet.
[116:55.05]I can wait.
[116:58.57]I'm just, this is like, I'm making like a prison.
[117:15.00]Fuck, negative 44.
[117:16.22]What do I do?
[117:16.88]Delete?
[117:17.25]No, I'm gonna wait.
[117:18.83]Just wait.
[117:20.07]There we go.
[117:21.03]Okay, we're positive again.
[117:23.83]Okay.
[118:08.68]This is going to be cool.
[118:11.73]Ready?
[118:18.23]Watch this.
[118:19.55]No, back it up.
[118:20.77]Really?
[118:38.07]Come on!
[118:38.61]I thought I could do this.
[118:39.59]I gotta go back.
[118:42.03]It's gotta go across this way.
[118:45.33]There we go.
[118:58.38]Is that too low?
[119:00.34]That's not too low, right?
[119:03.00]Is that too low?
[119:03.64]That's not too low?
[119:05.93]Oh, it's... if you stand up.
[119:10.24]Okay, it's fine.
[119:13.32]It's not too low, we're good.
[119:19.28]Straight ahead.
[119:19.96]I might have to change that a little.
[119:34.54]No, ugly.
[119:36.04]Ugly!
[119:36.42]Is it where Toad explains you how to play the game?
[120:03.79]The tutorial toad comes in.
[120:05.57]Damn it!
[120:38.03]Do a Toad impression?
[120:38.83]Got it!
[120:39.61]Monorail is done.
[120:41.20]Retro style, yeah.
[120:42.20]No, that's ugly.
[121:05.27]Four trains, five cars per train.
[121:08.40]What does that mean?
[121:10.50]Continuous shuttle mode?
[121:11.90]What is shuttle mode?
[121:16.13]Reliability, alright.
[121:17.97]This is, we gotta change this.
[121:18.91]This is gonna be orange.
[121:19.99]We got too much blue.
[121:22.40]Like orange.
[121:24.05]Ooh.
[121:24.69]No, we're going to make this like a gray.
[121:27.57]No, no, no, no, no.
[121:29.07]That's better.
[121:43.17]Let's assume it.
[121:45.17]Station style wood.
[121:47.39]No.
[121:47.77]Something... Something new.
[121:50.65]Something... Something daring.
[121:52.57]There we go.
[121:53.59]Pretzels.
[121:55.37]All vehicles are the same color.
[121:56.45]We're gonna make these orange.
[121:58.84]And... Oh!
[121:59.34]What?
[122:03.00]Who crashed?
[122:11.67]Why did it crash?
[122:12.67]Four people died.
[122:15.51]How?
[122:16.35]What happened?
[122:16.91]Wait, hold on.
[122:18.62]Sorry, it's funny.
[122:19.48]Never mind.
[122:48.88]Is it fine?
[122:49.58]Did somebody come over here?
[122:51.94]What do you mean close?
[122:53.34]Where is somebody to fix this?
[122:55.00]I'm not going on... Wait, wait, wait.
[123:04.73]What's happening here?
[123:07.95]I've been queued for Luigi's... It's too crowded here.
[123:16.60]I don't know what it is, man.
[123:19.36]But I keep seeing the orange crest toothpaste.
[123:23.92]They don't make it anymore.
[123:25.40]And I wish they did.
[123:26.28]You know, the orange shower clean toothpaste.
[123:33.02]I love that stuff.
[123:35.80]Bumper to bumper is broken down.
[123:42.73]Somebody fix it.
[123:47.73]Where are you off to?
[123:48.47]Answering radio call.
[123:49.93]Responding to Bumper to Bumper.
[123:51.59]No, no, no, no, no.
[123:52.79]Why are you not fixing this ride?
[123:57.31]I love that orange toothpaste.
[123:59.95]It was a gimmick.
[124:00.66]It was a marketing bunch of dog shit.
[124:06.74]But seriously, they made this thing that was like a shower for your mouth and it was super sudsy, super bubbly.
[124:17.34]I... I... What's wrong with this one?
[124:21.02]Oh, this is... Alright, I need... Let me just do this.
[124:25.60]Um... I need... These.
[124:30.49]I gotta open the monorail while there's still time.
[124:39.59]Just barely broke down two.
[124:40.90]What's with... Are they all queued up to break down at the same time?
[124:43.36]I need... I need more engineers.
[124:47.67]I need, like, two.
[124:48.91]I need another... I have to have one.
[124:52.87]Alright.
[124:55.73]This is nice and done.
[124:57.57]Let's get this out of here.
[125:02.69]I'm going to actually extend this.
[125:05.03]From the secret garden this way.
[125:08.29]Never mind, I can't... How am I going to... Over this way.
[125:14.92]Right through here.
[125:15.58]Because you've got to be able to access the monorail at the beginning of the part.
[125:20.40]There.
[125:50.32]There we go.
[125:51.16]Alright.
[125:53.92]Don't remove the supports.
[125:55.08]It's fine.
[125:58.10]So now let's... Monorail... I need to rename these.
[126:00.63]Alright.
[126:01.83]Get back.
[126:12.20]I can't... Will there be a line at the monorail?
[126:15.27]I don't think I should.
[126:15.87]I just look like a big snake.
[126:17.91]This could... It always works out this way.
[126:19.71]These stupid things are the most popular rides in the whole park.
[126:52.48]Open it.
[126:58.22]Open for business.
[127:00.30]There it is.
[127:07.46]No, that's slow.
[127:11.76]It's gonna be a long ride.
[127:19.38]Don't go too fast, you're gonna bump into each other.
[127:22.30]The toothpaste express!
[127:25.92]There we go, nice.
[127:28.32]See?
[127:28.60]Oh, I can't wait to ride the monorail!
[127:30.31]It's so much fun!
[127:32.99]Are these both- this is still closed!
[127:51.65]Are they both just not operational?
[127:53.73]Why is this one still closed?
[127:56.57]Luigi's Circuit.
[127:58.08]Open it!
[127:58.38]Did the person- did he even fix it?
[128:13.21]Alright, it works.
[128:23.70]Open for business!
[128:24.96]Come to the monorail, all of you.
[128:39.21]Who cares?
[128:42.69]It's back to normal.
[128:45.33]How come nobody can ride it?
[128:49.40]Downtime.
[128:52.08]Why are they not getting on the ride?
[128:55.40]Moving to end of station.
[129:00.68]Moving to end of station.
[129:05.45]Guests are complaining about the amount of trash in your park.
[129:12.77]What's going on?
[129:13.37]Moving to end of station.
[129:14.21]What's going on here?
[129:20.25]Oh, there we go.
[129:30.97]Okay, that was weird.
[129:36.68]I need to have a... I've got to expand.
[129:41.14]We can put something right here.
[129:42.70]I've got 4,400 bucks.
[129:45.60]I'm thinking of an expansion of a, not a roller coaster, but just a thrill ride.
[129:50.14]One of these eye poppers.
[130:16.27]On the line to the... No, no.
[130:18.41]This is too clustered.
[130:19.43]It's a little boss fight.
[130:31.92]Water ride?
[130:34.83]What if I... Okay, wait.
[130:35.53]This is the one...
[130:40.73]This would be fun.
[130:42.17]Yeah, this would be fun.
[130:44.03]Alright, check this out.
[130:45.57]Right in here.
[130:46.09]Make a little just raft area.
[130:54.58]Station platform, I'm going to say like this.
[130:56.34]It's not water.
[131:04.87]Check this.
[131:24.10]a water ride on grass.
[131:26.98]This ride sucks.
[131:29.75]No, this is stupid.
[131:30.57]This is dumb.
[131:36.27]No.
[131:36.39]This is not a fun ride.
[131:37.21]It's stupid.
[131:40.63]River rafts?
[131:43.65]River rapids?
[131:44.79]Splash boat.
[131:45.45]There we are.
[131:48.61]This has to be on a... I wonder if it has to be here.
[131:58.85]Does it have to be on water?
[132:31.53]Let's do a S-bend.
[132:33.87]No, no, no.
[132:36.77]Let's pull it all the way across here.
[132:40.01]S-bend.
[132:40.67]Can't construct too high.
[133:00.85]I mean, what are you talking about?
[133:04.76]It's too high.
[133:05.36]Oh, watch this.
[133:10.64]This is not porn music.
[133:31.62]Here it comes.
[133:37.46]Oh, I need a photo thing here.
[133:44.91]Right here.
[133:50.17]Photo section.
[133:51.48]Bang.
[133:52.10]Drop it down.
[134:56.01]Seriously.
[134:56.51]What the fuck?
[134:59.80]Why do they have to be so huge?
[135:11.28]Never been Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.
[135:17.77]Wait, does this auto-complete it for you?
[135:19.11]I have to go up.
[135:28.83]Let's do it twice!
[135:29.49]Do I get the money?
[135:42.20]Is that lined up?
[135:46.04]I think that's lined up.
[135:46.91]Oh, shit.
[136:13.08]Got it!
[136:45.02]And, yeah, I have to build... Oh, right.
[136:47.33]The entrance and exit.
[136:48.95]This could work, though.
[136:49.63]No, this could work.
[136:50.23]This can work.
[136:51.85]This'll work.
[136:52.81]I just have to do something really, really, really, really weird.
[136:57.35]Ready?
[136:57.63]Um... I think it's possible.
[137:04.92]Hold on.
[137:05.26]Why are there so many cards?
[137:17.48]Okay, let's start building this out.
[138:00.47]Damn it.
[138:02.03]Alright, finally.
[138:09.88]Jesus.
[138:10.62]I don't have any more money.
[138:14.52]Uh oh.
[138:21.57]How are people gonna ride this?
[138:23.99]They're gonna get on it and ride this ride.
[138:26.29]Look.
[138:35.58]This takes way too long.
[138:37.02]I should've just gone up and then down.
[138:40.18]Damn it.
[138:40.70]Okay, here it goes.
[138:54.44]Boom.
[138:56.57]Nice.
[138:57.29]And they get the picture taken and they get to go down one more.
[139:02.49]Now here's the real... issue.
[139:12.15]trying to get this to work.
[140:01.58]I'm trying... I'm trying to do a staircase.
[140:08.43]It's alright.
[140:09.11]It still works.
[140:11.03]Done.
[140:12.59]No, that's it.
[140:13.69]Alright.
[140:14.05]That doesn't matter.
[140:16.81]I can build this out here.
[140:19.89]Just wait.
[140:20.49]You'll see what I'm talking about here.
[140:29.47]I gotta build a whole new section of the park.
[140:40.10]Ah, this is when they're introducing the character of Geno.
[140:45.54]Geno is a doll.
[140:46.50]It is a... It's a little boy in one of the towns.
[140:50.06]It's one of his favorite toy.
[140:52.46]Mario and this little boy have a little standoff where they pretend to fight each other with the toys.
[141:05.87]Guests are complaining about the amount of trash.
[141:13.76]Okay, there we are.
[141:19.88]I don't want to do that.
[141:22.79]No, that's fine.
[141:25.03]Okay, so now this is connected.
[141:27.03]Also needs to connect to here.
[141:32.81]Alright, it's ready.
[141:40.01]How does it look?
[141:40.73]It's alright.
[141:47.30]I need to take 15 boats down, though.
[141:49.18]No, I don't think I... No, I don't.
[141:54.72]Okay, I can change the color of the water?
[142:03.48]Well, that is... Actually, I like it.
[142:08.70]It's gold.
[142:14.84]No, unassuming.
[142:23.39]That's better.
[142:33.21]That's better.
[142:36.43]Luigi Circuit, you suck.
[142:37.55]Alright.
[142:40.63]It's pretty good.
[142:41.47]Ready to go.
[142:42.25]Open.
[142:45.22]Hoping for business.
[142:48.06]Wait for the monorail.
[142:50.74]I thought it was broken.
[143:17.09]I guess it was.
[143:17.73]What a mess.
[143:27.49]Should I just scrap this thing and make something else?
[143:34.47]How many more janitors do I need?
[143:46.74]People like this ride?
[143:51.72]Yeah.
[143:52.66]No, not really.
[143:55.04]You know when you're not filling the whole stadium is a problem.
[143:57.94]Alright, where are those janitors?
[144:04.59]Get over here.
[144:08.75]You just stay over here.
[144:09.61]This is where all the trash is collecting.
[144:12.27]You just stay right there.
[144:19.31]Alright, research.
[144:21.49]Funding for roller coasters.
[144:23.13]It's, I want to have the, I'm going to wait until I have like $15,000.
[144:25.89]Now we play the waiting game.
[144:31.21]This thing is not fixed.
[144:32.21]I'm looking for a mechanic.
[144:33.69]What are you doing?
[144:35.27]What are you doing?
[144:37.19]Oopsie-daisy is broken down.
[144:38.77]What are you doing?
[144:39.91]You.
[144:40.05]You right here.
[145:01.31]Fix it.
[145:08.36]I fixed it.
[145:11.50]You do something to turn the router on and turn the router off.
[145:13.86]It's fine.
[145:14.26]4,100.
[145:14.32]I need some more shops.
[145:27.40]I think.
[145:27.66]Let's get some cotton candy.
[145:36.42]Dollar.
[145:38.31]Something else over here.
[145:38.85]How about the pretzels?
[145:40.29]Hot dogs?
[145:40.79]Uh, fruity icies.
[145:55.77]I like it.
[145:56.21]Stick it right here.
[146:00.23]Doll to 10.
[146:06.47]Something, I guess I got to put something here.
[146:07.89]I think I'm just going to make, I don't know, trash.
[146:22.92]I have trash cans everywhere.
[146:29.63]I really do have so many trash cans.
[146:31.05]That's not the problem.
[146:31.79]It can't be.
[146:41.65]People just come over here to dump the trash.
[146:44.66]This is the trash corner.
[147:02.40]Okay.
[147:02.58]3600.
[147:02.72]Where's my financials screen?

[148:48.19]The Squasher.
[148:49.83]The Squasher.
[148:51.66]You don't want to name your ride The Squasher.
[148:53.58]Uh, how about...

[150:20.77]Probably Oopsie Daisy.
[150:22.27]Whoopsie Doosie.
[150:23.46]Whoopsie Daisy.
[150:24.36]I don't... Whatever the names of these are, this is the longest one, right?
[150:36.28]He's not just, like, pushing people over in line, right?
[150:43.42]What if he gets on?
[150:45.60]He just pushes everybody out of the way and then gets on the ride.
[150:48.42]This would be so annoying.
[150:51.14]There's enough room for one person to be standing and he's just pushing people out of the way.
[151:01.96]Yeah, that would be funny.
[151:03.00]Haha.
[151:05.66]That would be funny.
[151:06.92]Ahem.
[151:15.29]Guests are complaining about the amount of trash.
[151:16.87]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[151:19.43]I have to put cans around.
[151:24.09]I've hired more janitors.

[151:34.18]What are you thinking?
[151:39.28]Whisper.
[151:40.64]You have a path.

[152:13.61]5100, alright, I'm making money.
[152:20.75]Oh, these people want to get off.
[152:29.49]I need something for the middle.
[152:31.58]Something for the middle.
[152:35.90]3D cinema?
[152:38.56]That might be kind of fun.
[152:48.61]3D cinema.

[153:43.68]Alright, no more spending money.
[153:57.03]Good.
[153:59.01]Maybe I could get one more thing here.
[154:00.31]Yeah, let's get one more.
[154:03.97]This, oh yeah, the roto drop.
[154:05.69]These things are awesome.
[154:06.31]Put it right somewhere cool.
[154:55.78]It's gonna work.
[154:59.30]But it's really stupid.
[155:00.82]And I don't like it, but it's... What am I gonna do?
[155:04.98]Take it off?
[155:17.63]I hate it so much.
[155:19.81]We'll see if it lasts.
[155:21.59]I'll give it 10 minutes.
[155:41.68]I hate it so much already.
[156:31.74]I fucking hate it.
[156:32.42]I'm trying to make it work.
[156:41.77]I can't... I should build another one on top of this one.
[156:45.46]This is such a mess.
[156:47.06]Why is it even allowed in the game?
[156:50.30]I shouldn't be allowed to do this.
[157:06.89]You can't even see the rides anymore!
[157:09.46]I can't- I'm gonna have to turn the camera on.
[157:59.71]I can't, man.
[158:07.89]This is the shit that looks like my clothes.
[158:12.11]Dirty laundry in the corner.
[158:13.55]That's what this looks like.
[158:17.21]This is a dirty laundry clothes pile of rides.
[158:26.88]Can I even make... I don't think I can even make this work.
[158:28.84]I have to go this way and then... Okay, I think I can.
[158:32.00]Here we go.
[158:32.88]No, it's going to be up.
[158:36.62]Back it up from here.
[158:41.13]I can turn it, right?
[158:41.95]It's going to be straight.
[158:47.49]Oh, come on.
[158:55.73]How the fuck am I gonna do this?
[159:04.01]How am I gonna do this?
[159:04.97]Exit on the right?
[159:06.57]Like, over here?
[159:17.24]This is shit in the way I
[159:48.99]Oh fuck, I gotta hurry up!
[159:56.41]Gotta- Awww!
[160:41.20]Hey, do you guys like my tree and its roots all over the place?
[160:49.14]I really do like- I'm gonna make this thing green.
[160:54.28]The only green thing in this whole park.
[160:57.73]It's just a fucking tree.
[161:05.19]There's the leaves.
[161:18.16]Have you ridden the big tree yet?
[161:46.78]Big tree!
[161:49.92]Alright, how fast does it go?
[161:56.43]Free fall drop.
[161:58.45]Yeah.
[162:03.28]That's really tall.
[162:15.45]It's so fast.
[162:16.37]Alright, how does it look?
[162:18.27]Let's see, we gotta give it one more test.
[162:43.33]Not yet available.
[162:44.07]73 miles per hour?
[163:00.15]70?
[163:00.17]80?
[163:00.19]80 to 0.
[163:03.13]Uh-oh.
[163:07.69]I don't think very many people are gonna ride the big tree.
[163:22.35]Come on, one daredevil's gonna get on here.
[163:24.19]I don't even know where the queue is.
[163:30.86]People are getting on!
[163:32.04]This guy's gonna get on!
[163:33.88]The only guy in the park!
[163:36.04]The one guy riding the big tree, and he's dressed as the big tree!
[163:41.47]That's the best part!
[163:42.89]He's ready!
[163:49.45]Get on there!
[163:52.03]Crazy Jay!

[164:04.22]He's just waiting patiently.
[164:05.18]He's the only one waiting.
[164:07.86]Come on, Crazy Jay.

[164:33.79]That's why he came over here.
[164:39.12]There he goes!
[164:42.80]See you later, Crazy Jay!
[164:48.84]That was nothing.
[164:52.33]What do you think?

[173:36.17]There we go.
[173:49.93]The tree and the weeds and the oak.
[173:53.45]I'm excited.
[174:03.17]Uh-oh.
[174:03.81]Turn it off!
[174:04.29]Turn it off!
[174:04.77]Turn it off!
[174:05.51]Turn it off!
[174:05.87]Turn it off!
[174:06.17]Turn it off!
[174:06.49]Turn it off!
[174:06.83]Turn it off!
[174:07.19]Turn it off!
[174:31.88]Oh, close the ride!
[174:33.96]Close the ride!
[174:41.06]God.
[174:41.52]Okay, so what happened?
[174:42.70]It couldn't go up this?
[174:43.90]Why?
[174:53.93]This has to be trimmed.
[174:58.67]Okay, trim it.
[175:00.97]Go forward.
[175:11.16]Good Try it again Uh-oh, we losing frames here?
[175:17.80]Hello?
[175:41.87]What the fuck is happening?
[175:44.91]I mean, I can see you guys typing.
[175:53.71]I have to charge my internet card.
[175:57.17]Oh, shit.
[175:57.55]Uh... This is weird.
[176:10.53]It says I'm still... Huh.
[176:16.06]This is freaking me out.
[176:21.41]Yeah, you guys can just hear me.
[176:27.93]Yeah, can you see my mouse moving?
[176:38.16]You can hear but not see.
[176:39.36]Yeah, I'm looking over here.
[176:42.81]It's like going all over the place.
[176:46.27]Strange.
[176:46.75]Yeah, I paused again.
[176:49.65]Mouse is moving?
[176:50.59]What's the... This is really weird.
[176:54.23]Hold on.
[176:56.71]Time for a telephone stream.
[177:00.55]Uh...
[177:04.37]No, it's not the game.
[177:05.13]It's the... Something going on with... I don't... It's not even like my internet.
[177:08.67]It's weird.
[177:11.75]It looks like it's my internet, but it's not my internet.
[177:16.66]Let me do something here.
[177:20.58]Yeah, the game is paused, but that doesn't matter.
[177:22.60]Hold on one sec.
[177:25.06]Yeah, this is fucked up.
[177:31.85]Because over on my OBS, I'm, like, red.
[177:34.37]Like, completely in the red.
[177:40.38]So don't ask me why this is happening.
[177:48.22]Well... I'm definitely still dropping frames, because here, look, if I unpause it, it'll probably happen.
[177:53.63]Yeah, see?
[178:01.93]Let me... It's very stuttery.
[178:06.16]Yeah, it looks like it's all screwed up.
[178:08.76]Give me one second.
[178:11.39]I'm going to try something.
[178:12.81]Give me one second.
[178:15.25]The stream might die, but it might come right back.
[179:27.14]Hello?
[179:27.80]Are we still... are we still bad?
[179:31.73]Uh... Yeah, this is weird.
[179:38.23]This shouldn't be happening, they just fixed it.
[179:48.12]They just fixed it and the same thing is happening again.
[179:55.01]Yeah, this is legit the same problem from three days ago.
[179:59.54]I'm dropping like 70% of all frames.
[180:05.94]This is just fucking bananas.
[180:10.32]The people on the engineering team actually even fixed it in the back end.
[180:15.39]Something really fucked up is going on.
[180:18.15]Somebody is killing this node.
[180:21.57]I have no idea what's going on.
[180:24.18]But, like, this is how fucked up this is, right?
[180:27.36]The last three days, shit's been almost perfect.
[180:34.79]I think I dropped, like, a hundred frames last night in, like, eight hours.
[180:38.01]And it was perfect.
[180:41.29]We got perfect for five hours straight.
[180:43.92]So what the hell's going on?
[180:44.74]You know what I'm saying?
[180:45.74]Like, somebody's fucking dumping us.
[181:02.60]I'm gonna wait.
[181:06.40]I'm gonna sit here for like a minute or two.
[181:07.90]I just want to build my mouse roller coaster.
[181:11.21]Are we good?
[181:17.45]Are we here?
[181:19.91]Is it fine?
[181:21.94]What the hell is going on?
[181:33.06]It's back to normal now.
[181:34.42]For now.
[181:37.78]Is somebody, like, pissing?
[181:39.88]On, like, the electrical outlet next to the node?
[181:44.67]I'd like to make no sense.
[181:48.33]What in the name of God?
[181:52.29]It's fixed.
[181:53.51]It's back to normal.
[181:54.23]That was just, like, four straight minutes of just dead internet.
[181:58.52]What in the name of God?
[181:59.56]Alright, well, whatever.
[182:00.22]I need to test this.
[182:09.16]Alright.
[182:09.38]Hey, welcome back, everybody.
[182:10.63]Hopefully, uh, hopefully we're still good here for a while.
[182:15.13]Alright, so what was it?
[182:15.95]Okay, I was testing this again.
[182:18.39]My mouse, my, my new mouse coaster.
[182:20.47]Where is it?
[182:22.35]Close it and open it back up.
[182:25.76]Test.
[182:26.12]Why can't I test it?
[182:32.90]Why can't I test the coaster?
[182:34.16]Is it because it crashed?
[182:44.00]Can I never open this ever again?
[182:45.32]No, no, I don't want to open it.
[182:49.40]I want to test it.
[182:54.81]Nobody's in the queue.
[182:55.75]Yeah, I know.
[182:58.49]It's because it crashed.
[182:59.45]You need to repair it.
[183:07.18]Let me go through and find where it would crash again.
[183:09.66]Let's see.
[183:11.42]So it looks like here it goes.
[183:12.94]I fixed that one.
[183:14.28]So it's going to go down, wrap around, then go up.
[183:17.98]I think it'll make it up that.
[183:20.06]Down, catch up, caught.
[183:22.66]I think it'll be fine now.
[183:23.42]Okay.
[183:38.33]Let's try it again.
[183:41.64]There we go.
[183:42.02]Alright.
[183:46.72]Come on.
[183:47.02]Work.
[183:48.08]Work.
[183:48.44]Work.
[183:48.78]Work.
[183:49.14]Work.
[183:49.48]Work.
[183:49.82]Work.
[183:57.19]There we go.
[183:57.61]First drop.
[183:58.87]Passes by.
[184:00.87]Over here.
[184:03.91]Chain added.
[184:04.61]Alright.
[184:05.02]We haven't seen this before.
[184:09.40]It goes around.
[184:43.93]So like right here needs to be a chain, right?
[184:48.53]I think that makes sense.
[184:57.26]That.
[185:02.52]Simulate the ride?
[185:04.99]Oh.
[185:06.63]That's helpful.
[185:07.15]I didn't even know that was possible.
[185:15.46]Delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.
[185:23.96]It's a little get caught there, slowly fall over here, and then that should be it.
[185:27.48]There it goes.
[185:36.84]And around.
[185:41.20]No.
[185:45.37]It's gotta be this one here.
[185:49.77]Damn it.
[185:50.11]This is bad.
[185:51.21]I'm gonna have to change this whole thing here.
[185:57.66]It's gotta be straight like this.
[186:02.70]On the chain.
[186:03.30]On the chain.
[186:09.34]Chain.
[186:10.18]Turn it.
[186:11.18]Turn it.
[186:12.48]Hard.
[186:13.06]Turn it hard.
[186:19.29]And that's it.
[186:20.31]Right there.
[186:21.79]Oh, what?
[186:22.85]How is that possible?
[186:23.69]What did I do?
[186:24.17]I screwed that up bad.
[186:27.94]That's not it right there?
[186:29.64]Damn it.
[186:31.66]Look at that.
[186:32.29]Looks perfect.
[186:34.98]nope
[187:12.60]straighten it out put the chain on straight bang a no straight again turn turn straight and then here I need to get over here I need to get rid of this how do I get on the other side
[187:41.78]I want to get over this way, but I can't get over there.
[187:44.04]Do I really have to go all the way around?
[187:46.34]Alright, that should help.
[188:04.15]Shit did it oh, I need to turn the camera what the hell Fuck
[188:33.50]Okay.
[189:06.31]I'll just be down and over.

[189:10.27]Look at the poles.
[189:11.11]Yeah.
[189:44.68]We'll back it up then.
[189:48.57]Not quite.
[189:49.01]A little bit over.
[189:49.61]I can't even see it!
[190:12.24]God damn it!

[197:47.27]I don't even know what that means.
[197:52.65]Oh, okay.
[197:55.98]They can't get up here.
[198:03.94]What a stupid placement.
[198:05.58]Okay, I can fix this.

[198:33.24]Down.
[198:36.86]Down.
[198:37.36]Straight.
[198:39.63]No.
[198:45.95]I'm gonna have to go down the whole way.
[198:48.53]And then turn it.
[198:49.13]Like, right here.
[199:13.15]I don't even know what's going on.
[199:25.08]Okay, I need to slow down.
[200:24.48]Why is this pre-recorded?
[200:31.36]Pre-recorded?
[200:32.26]How?
[200:33.68]It took him that long?
[200:41.95]What do you mean?
[200:45.97]I need to see this with a different set of eyes.
[200:48.37]Because this shit is fucked up.
[200:56.93]Okay.
[200:58.97]Guess they're complaining about the amount of trash.
[201:10.42]I'm not sure which way to look at this place.
[201:17.21]He's pretending to be bad.
[201:19.05]Well, no, I actually... This was going pretty smoothly until I built the second one of these.
[201:24.45]That's when it went off the rails.
[201:26.95]And then I just tried to see how many things I could get in the same spot.
[201:30.17]Actually, you know what?
[201:31.01]I'll be honest.
[201:31.49]I think I did a pretty good job.
[201:35.01]Let's put another one.
[201:38.95]I mean, nobody said that.
[201:42.75]Pathway exit to Luigi's.
[202:02.87]Wait, did he just pick up throw up?
[202:06.85]This guy right here.
[202:09.80]Why are they getting off and throwing up?
[202:14.62]This ride's not even that intense.
[202:16.90]This ride's stupid.
[202:28.33]There's so much... There's so much throw up there.
[202:33.14]Which one of these is closed?
[202:35.70]It's broken down.
[202:36.52]Where are my mechanics?
[202:37.78]Get another one!

[214:38.54]It happens to the best of us.
[214:43.87]Yeah, I'm streaming.
[214:44.61]You're right.
[214:45.75]Hey!
[214:46.09]I forgot like four times now.
[214:59.60]I just spaced the fuck out.
[215:01.18]Yeah, I did.
[215:02.10]I really did.
[215:02.74]It was like a hard space, too.
[215:04.46]I need an entrance.
[215:07.96]Entrance?
[215:08.30]Look at these.
[215:08.72]I don't have to do anything crazy for the entrance and exit here.
[215:10.52]Alright, let's see.
[215:11.04]Will this do it?
[215:11.56]What is this going to do?
[215:12.06]Okay.
[215:36.42]Where is it?
[215:41.45]What is it doing?
[215:48.17]What is it doing up here?
[215:57.11]This is not the break part.
[216:10.92]The game is not paused.
[216:18.84]Yoshi commits tax fraud OST.
[216:28.64]Alright, what's going on here?
[216:30.04]Are these not?
[216:30.74]Let me see here.
[216:34.63]Hold on.
[216:36.79]It's the chain, right?
[216:38.81]So, chain.
[216:40.09]Chain.
[216:41.65]The chain is still on.
[216:42.65]We're going to turn.
[216:46.63]And then close it.
[216:48.79]So what happened there?
[216:49.88]What's the problem?
[216:53.12]I don't understand.
[217:00.54]What are you doing?
[217:09.16]Why is it stuck?
[217:15.61]Chain acts as a block break?
[217:18.57]I thought the chain pulls it up.
[217:25.83]Isn't the chain supposed to pull it up?
[217:32.07]You need block break when you have two trains.
[217:42.15]Is the train stuck further along?
[217:43.91]Wait.
[217:46.69]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[217:54.44]This is what you're talking about.
[217:56.84]Okay, so I have to go over here.
[218:07.71]and take these breaks out here.
[218:25.47]The boosters aren't fast.
[218:26.33]They're 170 miles per hour.
[218:26.95]What do you mean they're not fast enough?
[218:31.81]Okay, here's a boost.
[218:34.56]So right here is where it needs to go out.
[218:38.48]So let's go like this.
[218:41.97]I need to get rid of these.
[218:43.59]These are all breaks, right?
[218:50.07]Boost, boost, boost, boost, boost.
[218:52.29]Boost.
[218:53.15]Done.
[218:54.68]Faster.
[218:55.12]I can't go faster.
[218:56.16]That's not going to happen.
[218:57.16]Alright.
[218:57.80]Turn it off.
[218:59.94]We good?
[219:00.30]Alright.
[219:02.32]We're good.
[219:02.60]Let's try it again.
[219:55.55]This is like taking a trip to the moon It took weeks to get and it takes weeks to get down.
[220:04.24]Oh my god.
[220:05.82]That would be horrible Holy shit
[220:30.34]I can't believe it didn't crash.
[220:35.30]These people, yeah, these people would be liquefied.
[220:44.51]Max speed 120 miles per hour.
[220:56.37]Let's see the Gs.
[220:58.29]Vertical Gs?
[221:05.96]You're like Skull Cracks.
[221:09.81]Let's see.
[221:29.42]Your stomach goes into the fucking back of your throat.
[221:40.73]Oh my god.
[221:43.23]Alright, it works.
[221:48.28]Open for business.
[221:51.48]I wonder if anyone will get on this.
[222:16.42]I love how this is parallel to the monorail.
[222:27.82]This thing's going to go by so fast.
[222:30.16]This is going to blow all this stuff over.
[222:31.54]No, no one's going to ride this.
[222:41.87]I got 13 grand.
[222:42.53]I'm still alright.
[222:46.20]It's still going.
[222:50.14]3D Cinema has done what?
[222:52.78]It's alright.
[222:54.62]So what about a scenario where I change this?
[222:58.66]And I make it go all the way down here.
[223:02.19]Slow drops.
[223:04.43]Slow drops.
[223:06.35]And just make a gigantic snake.
[223:11.17]And you actually are on the ride for like two or three months.
[223:15.45]What's my park rating?
[223:16.59]People have left.
[223:17.17]People left.
[223:17.71]Sorry.
[223:22.85]Yeah, I got too concentrated over here.
[223:25.48]This was starting to be alright, and then I just... Just this happened, and... I lost control completely.
[223:43.37]Hold on.
[223:43.65]Let me do something over here.
[223:44.45]Let me at least spread this out a little bit so it's not like concentrated nonsense.
[223:50.38]Alright.
[223:50.64]How about... I want to do an actual cool roller coaster.
[223:53.12]One that I actually would be proud of.
[223:55.60]Bobsled coaster?
[223:56.50]That's pretty cool.
[223:59.64]That's really cool.
[224:00.70]I want to make one.
[224:11.38]A bobsled coaster?
[224:15.17]Alright, let's make this for real.
[224:18.24]Let's say... What can I do?
[224:20.70]On-ride photo.
[224:21.38]Okay, let's go up.
[224:27.10]Not back it up.
[224:29.62]Okay, let's go... Let's go up this way.
[224:36.07]They're already 20 bucks.
[224:41.53]Just gently go up.
[224:49.64]Like that.
[224:52.60]Okay, nothing too ridiculous at first.
[224:54.48]Let's just go up a little bit like this.
[224:57.58]Drop that.
[225:00.76]Bend it to the... Maybe give it a nice turn here.
[225:05.82]I want a big cup.
[225:17.57]Alright, interesting.
[225:26.49]Charge higher for umbrellas.
[225:27.63]I can't.
[225:34.07]There.
[225:34.43]And then I want it to go up again.
[225:41.51]So that's it.
[225:42.03]This is the first little bit of an oops.
[225:43.83]You know, like up.
[225:46.65]Bend it this way.
[225:48.33]Check this out.
[225:48.89]Ready?
[225:49.35]So make it a little bit of a tilt scenario.
[225:53.34]Like this.
[225:59.55]Come on, you can do it.
[226:00.64]Come on.
[226:08.14]Okay.
[226:19.64]Bend it again a little.
[226:23.41]Now we're going to go on part two here.
[226:25.39]Part two is chain.
[226:27.86]I think that's enough speed.
[226:28.90]It might not... I hope it is.
[226:31.50]Up.
[226:36.26]Up again.
[226:36.70]Higher.
[226:39.92]That's alright.
[226:40.36]Right there's fine.
[226:41.17]That looks good.
[226:43.23]Now let's really bend that, twist it down.
[226:58.82]I ran out of money.
[227:14.40]That's good enough.
[227:15.10]And then bring it down.
[227:18.75]Let's bend it over this way.
[227:20.31]I think I can go up.
[227:23.07]Can I go up and over?
[227:25.17]Yep.
[227:27.95]I should be able to turn it one more time.
[227:31.03]I got five grand still.
[227:32.31]Those things are so expensive.
[227:35.21]Bank it again.
[227:40.35]Straighten it out.
[227:41.88]Down.
[227:45.60]We're gonna wrap it back this way one more time.
[227:52.24]Slow it up.
[227:53.94]Come in for the close.
[228:01.18]Go down with it.
[228:05.76]Turn this way harder.
[228:07.34]Right there.
[228:10.84]Drop it at the very end.
[228:13.36]Connect it.
[228:13.86]Alright.
[228:14.16]And I'm putting a statue up here.
[228:18.88]Oh, I need to put the thing in front.
[228:28.48]Yes, I know.
[228:30.56]Test it.
[228:32.20]How does it work?
[228:51.42]I like the little pretzel here.
[228:55.87]How are you guys getting a dick out of this?
[229:01.60]If this is a dick, then I don't... That would be an issue.
[229:11.41]I think I would... If that were... Never mind.
[229:19.14]Alright, it made it around the first pretzel.
[229:21.48]Come on!
[229:49.38]What kind of dick does... Listen.
[230:00.11]That is not a dick.
[230:05.30]It's... If anything... Oh, fuck.
[230:12.64]Alright, so I had trouble.
[230:14.46]I need to make this a little smaller.
[230:20.37]Let's go this way with it.
[230:22.51]I'm going to say, I'm going to say, so over here, this needs to be straightened out.
[230:34.10]So we're going to go forward with it.
[230:44.47]Wait, I can go like this.
[230:54.21]Should do it.
[230:54.67]Alright, get over that first hump.
[230:57.37]Because then I can go up this chain here.
[231:00.37]There's no way it's going to go up this.
[231:03.85]This has to be a chain as well.
[231:05.85]No way.
[231:07.39]Not going to happen.
[231:07.91]You know what I mean?
[231:11.30]You know what I'm saying?
[231:13.02]You know what I mean?
[231:15.54]This has to be a chain.
[231:35.17]This whole thing's just going to go away.
[231:50.59]And then down.
[231:53.21]And then back.
[231:54.57]What's the size on this guy?
[231:55.93]40 feet, 40 feet.
[231:58.47]Aye, I got it right there.
[232:00.99]Tighter.
[232:04.32]40 feet, 40 feet.
[232:06.58]Straight ahead.
[232:08.96]How's that 40 feet?
[232:09.56]That's not even 40 feet.
[232:10.36]What are you talking about?
[232:11.16]That's not 40 feet.
[232:16.56]That's not 40 feet.
[232:17.50]How's that 40 feet?
[232:18.60]That's not 40 feet.
[232:20.55]What's going on there?
[232:21.19]That's not 40 feet.
[232:22.03]That's bullshit.
[232:46.79]Double click?
[232:52.29]What does that do?
[233:00.63]God damn it!
[233:01.65]Money!
[233:09.98]Is that it?
[233:10.72]Is it going in there?
[233:11.78]Alright, does that work?
[233:12.94]Does that help me out there?
[233:14.60]I think it does.
[233:16.53]Ladies and gentlemen Test it Hmm?
[234:46.35]I'm sorry.
[234:46.88]I forgot I was streaming.
[234:52.78]Is that... But from this angle... It's also incorrect.
[234:59.20]Did I just get it?
[235:02.72]What is happening?
[235:14.15]50 feet.
[235:15.39]Just go forward.
[235:19.28]50.
[235:19.30]50.
[235:19.84]Straight ahead.
[235:21.26]You've done it.
[235:22.30]You've done it.
[235:22.90]Now you can play the game now, son.
[235:26.08]Thanks, Dad.
[235:26.62]Okay.
[235:48.03]Please, Cox.
[235:49.57]End this unholy stream.
[235:51.79]Why would you ever want that to happen?
[235:59.53]What happened?
[236:04.70]You're... You've failed your objective.
[236:11.00]Oh, whatever.
[236:11.34]I don't care.
[236:15.82]Look at how slow this is.
[236:16.98]It's not gonna be enough.
[236:18.20]This has to be a chain or something.
[236:19.76]This is so slow, it's not gonna happen.
[236:22.86]I gotta just delete these and make these chain.
[236:28.91]Is this little oomph gonna be enough?
[237:16.65]Open it.
[237:16.91]I don't care.
[237:28.09]Come on now.
[237:41.70]People are going to be fine.
[237:43.43]There's no enclosed thing.
[237:45.51]That's good.
[237:46.99]Can I define momentum?
[237:48.85]When you go... When you're going forward at a certain speed, and when you're... The way to slow yourself down, you're going... Your weight is pushing forward.
[238:02.94]So there's... You have that extra... You know... I can't talk right now.
[238:11.38]It's forward motion.
[238:13.38]And the momentum is like your weight combined with how fast you're moving forward.
[238:18.19]And then if there's no more engine running, you turn the engine off and you're still going forward, you're still going to move forward because you have momentum.
[238:34.23]Uh-oh, he's leaving us in the realm.
[238:42.10]I just want it to work.
[238:46.42]This is my fifth year running this place.
[238:50.81]This has been a nostalgia trip, though.
[238:52.73]It really has.
[238:53.19]I remember doing this same exact shit.
[239:00.47]Is anybody even riding this?
[239:07.08]See, this is fun.
[239:08.38]You go around one, two...
[239:13.64]Then you go to the drop.
[239:14.86]Yeah, this is a fun coaster.
[239:16.08]This is not, like, broken or bad or screwed up or anything.
[239:21.32]I mean, people have... Oh, you killed somebody!
[239:23.80]No, I didn't.
[239:52.62]This person's still in line.
[239:54.98]Do you really want to go on this?
[240:01.37]Are you sure that you want to go on this ride?
[240:04.31]Do you really?
[240:05.17]I just want to make sure that you're aware of what happens when you're on this.
[240:27.74]Can't even whatever at the very very very end Why would it explode here?
[240:57.56]Of all the places, here?
[240:58.84]Look at how slow this goes.
[241:12.00]Too much wiggle at the end?
[241:53.59]No, I got it wrong.
[241:55.48]Make more of the dinosaur statues.
[241:57.26]You know what, that's not a bad idea.
[242:55.77]Okay, I have so much trouble with this.
[242:58.37]Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, you just hit the auto button and it does it.
[243:01.32]I didn't play this one as much as I played 3.
[243:45.76]I'm gonna fucking lose my mind This is like doing a three-point turn in like a parking lot It's like parallel parking a car
[245:40.25]End of sanity?
[245:49.85]No, I'm fine.
[245:50.53]Although I'm probably gonna stop streaming soon, though.
[245:54.89]It's getting late.
[246:02.35]Alright, somebody get on it.
[246:05.44]It's safe.
[246:06.64]I promise.
[246:20.71]What's the problem?
[246:24.38]Why does nobody want to ride it?
[246:25.68]What's the issue?
[246:30.48]We made it around.
[246:31.32]Good.
[246:32.33]Up.
[246:33.31]Around.
[246:34.33]Goes all the way around.
[246:35.41]Comes over here and that's it.
[246:37.17]Is the engineer gonna ride it?
[246:50.57]It goes slower than the people are walking.
[246:53.41]Temporarily.
[246:58.49]Ride sucks LOL true.
[247:01.80]Did you just do two comments answering your own thing?
[247:07.24]What?
[247:07.40]Here we go!
[247:20.56]Cool bends on the bobsled.
[247:22.86]Somebody waiting in line.
[247:23.92]It is safe.
[247:25.56]Plenty of time for this to slow down.
[247:27.25]Around.
[247:28.37]A little bend.
[247:32.69]Done.
[247:34.11]It's safe to ride.
[247:35.83]Get on.
[247:37.11]Welcome.
[247:41.46]Oh, ride sucks.
[247:42.40]Yeah, true.
[247:44.38]True.
[247:47.02]Oh my god.
[248:00.35]Why is this off?
[248:03.41]Why is this right off?
[248:21.47]Alright, it's been fun.
[248:24.19]I think I'm done streaming for today.
[248:28.44]Why does your theme park... Why does your theme park look like the cables behind my TV?
[248:36.47]Well, that's a great question, viewer.
[248:39.67]The answer is not so simple.
[248:47.48]Nobody riding the tree either.
[248:49.10]Why is it closed?
[248:53.87]No, there's a ride back here that's been closed the whole time.
[248:57.32]Where are my rides?
[248:58.00]Where's my ride overlay?
[249:03.60]Oh, the duality of chat.
[249:05.42]I'm hungry.
[249:05.84]I'm not hungry.
[249:15.52]It's not closed.
[249:16.14]It's just unpopular.
[249:17.08]No, it's closed.
[249:21.06]Where is my list...
[249:24.67]Where's my list?
[249:25.67]Broken down.
[249:26.27]The big tree.
[249:28.55]I just saw it move up and down.
[249:29.85]What are you talking about?
[249:30.59]How is it broken down?
[249:34.01]Alright, it's open.
[250:01.15]People like this one?
[250:03.33]And you guys said this is a shitty coaster.
[250:06.33]Look at how wrong that was.
[250:07.79]We already got a line out the door.
[250:16.64]This is like one of the biggest coasters in the park.
[250:27.34]That was fun.
[250:32.25]I need to do go-karts?
[250:33.84]Alright, that's the last thing I'm gonna do.
[250:38.10]I'm at my maximum.
[250:44.53]Where's go-karts?
[250:45.55]There it is.
[250:46.03]Go-karts!
[250:47.25]Let's go.
[252:40.35]And let's seal it up.
[253:04.45]Is this the?
[253:05.77]Where is it?
[253:16.33]It's like, where's Waldo?
[253:17.07]I have no idea where it is.
[253:21.31]Does anybody have any idea?
[253:37.20]Next to the Ferris wheel?
[253:43.14]No, no, no.
[253:43.40]I'm saying, where's the thing to end it?
[253:48.32]It's like over here, right?
[253:49.60]I can't even see it that far.
[253:51.94]So it's over here.
[253:52.52]Right in there.
[253:58.46]Right there.
[254:09.31]I'm gonna run out of money.
[254:13.83]Yeah, this is my official who gives a shit.
[254:27.30]I had a lot of fun, though.
[254:28.52]This game's a blast.
[254:29.34]It always is.
[254:29.80]Alright, almost out of money.
[254:34.78]And then... I have to... I can't even take out any more loans.
[254:45.41]Alright, so it's over here.
[254:46.65]I can fix it a little bit, I think.
[254:48.86]Out of money.
[254:49.90]What are the cheats?
[255:06.86]What are the cheats?
[255:08.16]Anybody got a cheat code?
[255:30.89]No, I need this thing.
[255:33.49]No, it's right here.
[255:34.55]The go-karts.
[255:35.53]There it is.
[255:54.22]Does everybody take screenshots of this?
[255:56.84]Just this one screenshot.
[255:58.00]That's all I want.
[256:04.31]OK.
[256:12.47]I'm out of money, so that's the end of the stream.
[256:26.82]So how do you sell the park?
[256:35.09]Look at this place.
[256:36.45]I have all this room and I concentrated on the tree.
[256:42.07]Select everything.
[256:52.12]Sell everything.
[256:52.82]No, I spent a lot of time making this mess.
[256:59.30]Yeah, I got bad cable management in my PC, so what?
[257:09.77]Save it, save it.
[257:10.45]Alright, I'll save it, I'll save it, I'll save it.
[257:11.91]Save, save game.
[257:14.97]And then sell everything.
[257:15.75]But how do you, how would I do that?
[257:17.61]I'm in the negative right now.
[257:20.18]Just go by one by one?
[257:33.11]And then I'm going to pay back my loan and then leave.
[258:06.50]Okay, what's left?
[258:10.49]What?
[258:12.03]Who's drowning?
[258:15.69]Stephen K has drowned.
[258:17.59]Who?
[258:17.87]Where?
[258:19.41]Who's drowning?
[258:20.03]Where are they?
[258:22.76]There's a duck.
[258:25.08]These are ducks.
[258:43.73]Alright, let's pay the loan back.
[258:57.44]Do I even have enough? $100,000.
[259:01.52]Only the tree and the monorail.
[259:03.66]And this mess.
[259:04.76]Well, that was actually a lot of fun.
[259:05.74]I actually had a really good time.
[259:07.84]This was a fun game.
[259:08.89]Up until the last probably 45 minutes to an hour when I just... I just lost my mind.
[259:18.11]Why is my rating so bad?
[259:19.11]Because I started to do this.
[259:21.60]And I also just... 10 people just drowned.
[259:35.41]Aww.
[259:36.14]This is so funny.
[259:38.54]What a fun game.
[259:40.58]But that's gonna be it for me.
[259:42.74]We're gonna do the bits.
[259:50.62]It should cost tickets.
[259:52.78]Before I go, let me see one more thing that this... Close this.
[259:58.19]You can go even higher.
[259:59.11]345 feet.
[260:04.76]Oh my god, their buildings aren't even this tall.
[260:09.92]Can you add anything to this?
[260:14.55]Refurbish.
[260:18.47]Vertical tower entry.
[260:20.21]No, you can just do the vertical tower.
[260:27.27]I did enjoy making the tree.
[260:33.41]So if there's... I did want to try to get the Twitch integration to work.
[260:39.72]But sadly, they shut it down like last year.
[260:43.94]So I'm going to look into having a server because what happens is people in chat are people in the game.
[260:53.13]Every single person in here is somebody from chat is how that integration works.
[260:59.43]That would be really fun.
[261:03.52]And I would play this again if I could get that to work.
[261:09.60]But I do need to set up my own server, which I kind of have to figure that out.
[261:19.45]But in the meantime, I'm going to call it here.
[261:24.29]We're going to do the bits and I will see you guys in a couple days.
[261:32.14]Today is Wednesday.
[261:33.50]I will see you guys on Saturday.
[261:39.24]So I'll see you guys Saturday and Sunday.
[261:42.49]This weekend, we've got some interesting things to do.
[261:47.53]Saturday and Sunday is going to be... Hopefully the internet works because every Saturday and Sunday stream, everyone always gets shut down by Cox for some weird reason, but we're going to try it anyways.
[261:57.99]We're going to do Connect.
[261:59.47]I have
[262:01.95]just to under 30, 40 Kinect games.
[262:05.91]Ranging from ones that are probably fun to ones that are probably be played for about eight minutes and then immediately taken out.
[262:17.96]That's going to be on Saturday.
[262:21.32]I am preparing myself for that.
[262:26.28]If you have an idea of a game, I have it.
[262:31.03]I went through meticulously and purchased every single Kinect game that I thought would be even remotely interesting on stream.
[262:41.52]There's 40 of them.
[262:44.94]Almost every single one.
[262:50.84]We are gonna do that for Saturday and Sunday.
[262:53.90]I don't know how long that's gonna take us.
[262:56.10]I don't know exactly how far we'll get through them.
[263:01.61]We may need to add another day.
[263:05.05]I don't know.
[263:06.59]But thanks for joining me.
[263:08.01]I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[263:10.05]Take care.
[263:13.53]See you soon.
[263:15.69]And we will do the bits if you take it off.
[263:18.09]Have a good one.
[263:20.72]I have already saved this park.
[263:22.00]I saved the park a few times, too.
[263:25.56]So I saved it before all the nonsense.
[263:27.22]I can go back in there if I really want to.
[263:31.00]But let's do the bits.
[263:33.76]Let's go back six and a half hours ago.
[263:38.08]Yeah, that was also open RCT 2.
[263:40.25]Oh, debauchery man.
[263:45.23]Thanks for the 250.
[263:45.83]Remember that part of the Matrix where Neo couldn't drive off that building so he kicked walls until he was launched upwards?
[263:52.90]That was my favorite part.
[264:01.81]That was a pretty good part.
[264:03.21]Referencing the first game we played tonight.
[264:08.73]That game was also very fun.
[264:11.78]And yes, I was kind of just mouth open being a weirdo the last hour or two here, forgetting I was on a livestream.
[264:18.60]But it was fun.
[264:19.18]It was relaxing to me.
[264:21.80]Making, you know, chutes and ladders.
[264:27.61]What is fun coaster?
[264:29.89]Let's see.
[264:35.03]Then you go to the drop.
[264:36.27]Yeah, this is a fun coaster.
[264:37.47]This is not, like, broken or bad or screwed up or anything.
[264:42.79]I mean, people have, oh, you killed somebody!
[264:45.19]No, I didn't.
[264:45.63]It's a fun coaster.
[264:58.22]Thank you, debauchery man, again for 250.
[264:59.64]Remember the part in Goldeneye 007 when Pierce Brosnan panics and starts kicking random doors until one opens?
[265:06.03]That's one of my favorite parts.
[265:08.01]Me too.
[265:12.77]Hey, Shelbykun, thanks for the $10.
[265:13.95]Hey, Jermbo, I thought I'd give you a little bit of money.
[265:16.89]Also, here's a drawing I drew of you and me.
[265:20.91]Hope you like it.
[265:22.81]I love it.
[265:23.13]Yeah, I love it.
[265:35.80]This is amazing.
[265:37.96]It's fantastic.
[265:39.51]Thank you.
[265:43.23]This is the cutest picture ever.
[265:46.97]Thank you, Shelby Kun.
[265:57.74]Auto in the window.
[265:58.50]Yep, that's true.
[266:00.04]And thanks for the $10 as well.
[266:02.32]Put that one up on the fridge.
[266:03.36]Yep.
[266:05.76]Hey, OG Lossy, thanks for the five dollars.
[266:09.44]Ho ho, you missed that one.
[266:11.30]Try another.
[266:14.00]Six dollars, actually.
[266:15.24]Thank you, OG Lossy.
[266:19.52]Seven Layer Wario, thanks for the three bucks.
[266:22.75]I took off work for the carnival stream to make a bunch of food for my partner and I. Can't wait to see it.
[266:27.81]You're awesome.
[266:31.09]Should be between four to six hours long.
[266:36.04]That is the time we have blocked off, so... Should be a whole day event.
[266:44.75]Hope you enjoy it.
[266:46.61]Thanks for the three dolls.
[266:49.05]Quarter dime, thanks for the three dolls.
[266:50.49]I want to get off Mr. Bone's wild ride.
[266:53.97]Nobody ever said that, though.
[266:55.80]People got in line, they rode them.
[266:57.44]Oh, they just didn't.
[267:10.47]Hey, Mebius, thanks for the $5.
[267:13.97]Help, I fell asleep on the car ride and when I woke up the park was closed.
[267:16.79]It's been three days.
[267:17.69]Please stop the ride.
[267:25.41]Flugboy, thanks for the $5.
[267:26.35]Hope you've been doing well, Jeremy.
[267:29.31]Wanted to say I've been being haunted lately by an automobile in my town.
[267:33.90]Lately because of the sole reason its first three digits on its plates are JECs.
[267:50.48]Maybe.
[267:53.00]Thank you for the five dollars, plug boy.
[267:56.06]T-Po, thanks for the five bucks.
[267:59.12]Uh... Bro, you're violating the... Americans with Disabilities Act.
[268:08.08]Why would... Because of... The rumor, rumor?
[268:16.30]Jex, yeah.
[268:22.65]Thank you, Teepo, for the $5.
[268:23.65]It's because I didn't... Well, how did I make that?
[268:29.09]I tried to make stuff.
[268:31.47]I'm talking about my park.
[268:41.54]Why did I just fade out?
[268:43.06]Did I?
[268:43.34]I should be here.
[268:50.51]There's way more going on at that park, I think.
[268:52.49]A lot of things to be concerned about there.
[269:02.88]He's gone.
[269:04.82]Wolfgang, thanks for the ten bucks.
[269:08.30]Jerma, I don't get to watch your streams live too often, but I'm always happy to catch one.
[269:12.16]You're one of the best.
[269:13.94]I'm honored to be put in that category for you.
[269:16.04]Thank you.
[269:17.75]For the ten dollars.
[269:20.10]Thousand bits.
[269:21.14]Thank you, Wolfgang.
[269:26.11]Thank you, Amazing Sponge, for the 250.
[269:29.08]Hey, Jerma, I worked a teenage job this past summer in an ice cream shop, which means I've earned enough to tell you how much I appreciate your streams, VODs, highlights, and you.
[269:37.90]I know it's hard to appreciate your viewers due to their incomprehensible scale, but I want you to know you make one 16-year-old Rhode Eyelander's life a lot better with your work.
[269:47.07]Good luck to you for your first full year in Vegas, and good luck to me for junior year in high school.
[269:54.18]Good luck to you.
[269:59.87]New England.
[270:00.95]I miss it all the time.
[270:09.51]But good luck.
[270:13.65]Thank you, Amazing Sponge, for the 250.
[270:19.50]And as the channel grows, I do... I never want to lose that aspect of
[270:28.76]People just become numbers.
[270:31.96]It can be hard sometimes to essentially... Let's say you do this and there's 2, 3, 4, 5 thousand people here.
[270:41.59]It's hard to individualize everybody.
[270:49.09]But I don't want to have that scenario where people adjust numbers.
[270:52.85]It freaks me out a little.
[271:06.94]But then on the other hand, right, it's... Sometimes it can kind of be overwhelming sometimes, if you think about it.
[271:16.31]Not this kind of thing, but just trying to go over in my head just how many people may or may not be here.
[271:28.87]But over the years, I've... If there's 5,000, 10,000, 500,000 people here, I would act the same.
[271:36.23]I wouldn't really change anything.
[271:40.06]I feel like I haven't really done... I haven't really changed who I am as a person, I don't think, since starting this.
[271:46.54]I think I've been pretty much the same as I was.
[271:52.40]From 100 views on a YouTube video to people watching this.
[272:03.68]Maybe I have, maybe a little.
[272:06.71]Not that I've been able to see and look in the mirror and go, you've changed.
[272:09.65]I don't know, maybe that's the talk of the villain that is changing, I don't know.
[272:17.07]But, thank you Gnarly for the 250.
[272:20.41]You playing Super Mario RPG OST makes me want to see you play another Mario RPG like Paper Mario or the Mario and Luigi series.
[272:29.22]Those are some of my favorite games ever.
[272:32.42]The Mario & Luigi series, believe it or not, is made by some of the same people that made Super Mario RPG.
[272:39.90]Same director, right?
[272:41.58]Was it AlphaDream?
[272:43.06]One of the developers that released back when they were doing that?
[272:50.18]I think that's accurate.
[272:55.18]I have played Super Star Saga.
[273:02.85]And I've not played the other ones though.
[273:05.23]I would probably like them.
[273:10.88]But yeah.
[273:12.08]I wasn't that big of a fan of Paper Mario.
[273:17.14]Not really.
[273:18.82]I respect Paper Mario, but I don't really enjoy playing Paper Mario.
[273:30.04]I respect it.
[273:31.82]But I don't really... It didn't grab me like the other ones did.
[273:37.85]That may have changed since I've grown older.
[273:40.67]Maybe I will appreciate it now than I did maybe 10, 15 years ago.
[273:43.55]I don't know.
[273:55.37]But that was, uh, gnarly.
[273:56.73]Smellyboy, thanks for the 250, Smellyboy.
[273:58.57]Jerma, you're insane if you don't think we'd all watch you do a playthrough of Super Mario RPG.
[274:03.22]Seriously, what you did for Sorcery and played, uh, seriously, do what you did for Sorcery and play it over the course of a couple weeks, like every other stream.
[274:11.54]It would be great.
[274:13.92]Uh, Mario RPG's not that long of a game.
[274:19.56]You could probably get through the whole thing.
[274:21.92]Especially if you know what you're doing and where you're going in 7 to 10 hours.
[274:26.87]I don't think it would take that long.
[274:30.99]Maybe a little bit longer.
[274:32.41]12 hours, maybe?
[274:37.61]Should I?
[274:38.33]Should I just do it?
[274:41.54]Should I?
[274:41.88]What do you think?
[274:45.40]Should I do it?
[274:47.54]Should I stream Super Mario RPG?
[274:55.48]Yeah.
[274:56.52]I mean, yeah, of course.
[274:57.26]I'll love it.
[274:57.82]I haven't... I beat... You know when you find that game that you love and it's like one of your favorite games ever made?
[275:03.61]And somehow you stumble into it and end up playing it again every few years?
[275:08.31]I have played Super Mario RPG and beaten it.
[275:14.06]Probably, yeah, like more than 20, 30 times.
[275:17.16]I play through it probably once every couple years.
[275:21.73]Yeah, let's do it.
[275:24.67]That'll be a chill just stream.
[275:27.63]Or two.
[275:28.95]Yeah, let's do it.
[275:29.61]Why not?
[275:31.70]We'll do that after Connect.
[275:36.56]Yeah, fuck yeah, let's do it.
[275:37.88]Let's do it.
[275:38.16]I'm ready.
[275:38.38]I'm ready.
[275:41.06]That music, too, just made me want to play it.
[275:42.72]I want to go down the river again and collect the coins.
[275:49.88]Yeah, after the Connect weekend, we'll settle down and I'll play through Mario RPG.
[275:58.75]Still going to do the GTA Online Casino.
[276:00.53]I still am looking for people to play it.
[276:03.24]There's like three or four other streamers that I threw a line out to and I'm trying to see if we can set something up.
[276:08.80]I think that's more fun with other people.
[276:10.68]Like streamers or YouTubers or whatever.
[276:12.32]Not YouTubers, but you know what I mean.
[276:19.56]He got ghosted.
[276:27.77]It's real money.
[276:30.39]Don't they give you like a fake currency to use for a little while?
[276:34.79]Don't forget Sam and Max.
[276:36.41]The thing about Sam and Max is, the last couple times I was thinking of doing it, it was on a poll, and nobody voted for it.
[276:46.70]That's why I'm kind of waiting.
[276:48.12]I think we hit Sam and Max exhaustion.
[276:52.18]Because I played through both the first two seasons pretty close to each other.
[276:57.40]And I think we may have seen some Sam and Max exhaustion.
[277:04.51]So I'm just going to keep it in the pocket for a little while.
[277:16.46]We'll go back to it.
[277:17.08]We will.
[277:17.66]I'm not just going to start it and not finish it.
[277:19.80]Especially the fact that it's the third season and I did the first two full seasons.
[277:29.21]But...
[277:30.75]Thank you, Lemon Pudding, for the $2.50.
[277:32.59]Jerma, apologize publicly to FortniteJimmy2010 for what you did yesterday.
[277:36.96]Or I'm going to tell Grillmaster BBQ about it.
[277:40.58]And this time he will ruin your career.
[277:47.45]Grillmaster BBQ.
[277:49.55]I don't think it's streamed in like seven or eight months.
[277:55.11]So, I mean... Okay.
[277:59.02]Okay.
[278:06.02]turned it on once he winked at the camera like 15 times over the course of about 14 minutes he's sitting there for about 15 minutes he winked like three four five six times a few minutes went by winked and then he turned the stream off I didn't know when he always would I think he was part of his he did this thing where he did a big arg on his channel
[278:29.42]And he really got way over his head with it.
[278:30.94]He had hours and hours of ARG footage on his channel, and he was doing something with the Twitch thing.
[278:36.98]I think it got too much for him, and he didn't want to do it anymore, so he decided not to do it anymore, I guess.
[278:48.47]I was keeping up a little bit.
[278:54.85]Hey, thank you, Raddest Raccoon, for the $2.50.
[278:56.65]Thank you.
[279:00.32]Hey, Jerma, jermaChomp.
[279:01.58]Just want to tell you that I look forward to your streams every week.
[279:04.42]And your streams have helped me through a lot of days where I was feeling extremely anxious and depressed.
[279:08.15]You're the best.
[279:10.61]Thank you, RaddusRaccoon.
[279:14.99]This community has a way of making us all feel a little better.
[279:22.32]And making us all have fun.
[279:25.34]The last three streams in a row here.
[279:27.97]It's just been a lot of just fun back and forth, I think.
[279:31.06]Like, it really has.
[279:31.74]One of my favorite things about this channel is just being able to go back and forth with you guys.
[279:38.50]I love that the live just bullshit.
[279:44.31]It's so much fun for me.
[279:47.07]Hope it is for you.
[279:51.55]The back and forth bullshit is... It's great.
[280:02.57]But thank you.
[280:04.99]I'm glad you're here.
[280:06.05]Glad you're hanging out.
[280:07.23]Glad you enjoy the streams.
[280:13.42]Also, thank you to... Al the Chemist.
[280:20.58]Al the Chemist.
[280:22.24]For $5.
[280:22.42]They just say Jerma Dafoe.
[280:25.29]Thank you, Al.
[280:28.31]Thank you, S10WUpdate for the $2.50.
[280:30.25]Thank you.
[280:34.67]Hey, Jerma.
[280:35.55]Hey.
[280:36.69]I'm back to watching your streams again.
[280:38.07]Happy I get to see you stream again.
[280:40.13]Even for a little bit.
[280:41.69]You and your humor have inspired my movie directing style.
[280:45.55]And now that I'm able to make my first movie soon, I just want to say thank you for inspiring me from the bottom of my heart.
[280:51.45]Even if you don't know me that well, thank you.
[280:53.93]Peace and love.
[280:54.39]Stay great.
[280:56.65]Thanks.
[281:00.82]Good luck with your productions.
[281:05.28]Whatever they may be.
[281:13.66]Maybe you can give us some more info soon.
[281:16.47]We've got doctors, yeah.
[281:17.41]We've got directors.
[281:18.09]We've got scientists.
[281:18.93]We have dentists.
[281:22.09]I told you guys this before.
[281:23.33]I got like an email newsletter from Twitch and it said it was who has the most dentists watching their streams.
[281:31.34]And I was number six.
[281:34.66]I was two slots above Dentistry x BBQ.
[281:43.17]So, I mean, that's kind of interesting.
[281:56.04]Thank you, though.
[281:56.44]Good luck.
[281:59.54]Uh, Fiona, thanks for the five dollars, Fiona.
[282:02.69]Hey, Jerma, read this in your best text-to-speech voice.
[282:05.49]Hey, PlayDoomOST.
[282:06.85]Okay.
[282:08.79]Hey, Jerma, read this in your best text-to-speech voice.
[282:12.46]Hey, Jerma, PlayDoomOST.
[282:14.22]There you go.
[282:22.70]Hey, eggscramble, thanks for the 250.
[282:24.68]Great stream as always.
[282:25.50]Enjoy the rest of your night, buddy.
[282:26.94]Also, can you remind me of the date of the carnival so I can get work off the 21st of September?
[282:35.52]September 21st of this year.
[282:37.89]2019.
[282:39.15]Thank you, eggscramble, for the 250.
[282:48.49]Demons V, thanks for the $3.33.
[282:50.27]There's no message, but thanks for the $3.33.
[282:52.63]I'm gonna run the credits.
[282:55.61]They may have been destroyed.
[282:58.55]When the internet just... That was really weird.
[283:00.61]The stream kind of cut in half for two minutes or something, and then went back completely to normal.
[283:08.66]That was strange.
[283:12.60]That was very strange.
[283:16.23]Hopefully we got most of you.
[283:18.05]Thanks, everybody.
[283:21.69]Thank you, Demons V, for the $2.50 on top of the $3.33.
[283:27.23]They say, Big Sim, think hard.
[283:30.79]Big Sim and then the meatloaf?
[283:35.78]I'm not sure what that is.
[283:39.02]But thank you for the $2.50.
[283:44.36]Appreciate it, Demons V.
[283:50.44]You ever played Animal Crossing?
[283:52.98]Yeah.
[283:54.08]I played the last one that was on the DS.
[283:58.72]What was the last Animal Crossing on the 3DS?
[284:02.05]I did put some time into that.
[284:03.53]I put probably... Maybe 30 hours?
[284:07.85]40 hours into that one?
[284:09.05]That is newly.
[284:09.69]Okay.
[284:13.23]I never streamed it.
[284:14.65]It was just something I just sat around in bed playing.
[284:21.28]30 hours?
[284:21.86]Yeah, that's not a lot.
[284:23.20]Yeah, but that's a lot for lying in bed for an hour and playing it for 30 days in a row.
[284:34.87]When the new one comes out, I'm not sure I would stream it.
[284:37.93]Maybe I would.
[284:38.43]Yeah, I played that game for a month straight.
[284:47.47]A full month.
[284:50.64]Oh, I'm just realizing something.
[284:55.10]This stream title... I was going to change it.
[284:59.76]Didn't I say I was going to change that?
[285:02.06]It was just Roller Coaster Tycoon 2.
[285:03.96]That's the most unclickable title you could ever have.
[285:15.43]Whatever.
[285:18.85]This is the name of the game when the name of the game is underneath the stream.
[285:24.17]So my stream in the browse page was RollerCoasterTycoon2, RollerCoasterTycoon2.
[285:31.59]Good.
[285:34.05]That's great.
[285:39.87]That's a very safe, normal title.
[285:44.32]Hey, I still clicked it.
[285:45.28]Alright, good.
[285:49.95]Yeah, that's the kind of title where somebody comes in and if they ask the name of the game, there is a 100% chance that they're just fucking with you.
[286:08.08]But I will see you guys in a couple days for the start of the Connect weekend.
[286:13.73]I will see you on Saturday and Sunday.
[286:22.50]Saturday the 24th.
[286:23.40]A couple days from now.
[286:28.58]Same time.
[286:31.05]Somewhere around like 2, 3.
[286:32.87]It might be pulled back a little earlier.
[286:34.99]Maybe.
[286:35.23]We'll see.
[286:36.93]Keep an eye on the sus.
[286:39.39]Good night.
[286:40.71]Goodbye.
[286:42.67]Thanks for watching.
[287:14.90]Thank you.
