[05:34.48]Oh, I see.
[05:36.76]Or do I see?

[06:10.81]Visit the two worlds to proceed.
[06:13.21]Okay.
[06:20.86]Travel to Astral Equinox to pass this gate.
[06:24.90]Alright.
[06:27.17]It's kind of like an open environment where I can go wherever.
[06:29.49]What's up here?
[06:35.67]I see.
[06:38.33]Return to difficulty selection.
[06:39.93]I don't want to do that.
[06:40.53]Should I just jump over?
[06:43.83]Oh no.
[06:59.11]Fall off the- God damn it, I shouldn't have even walked grandma across the street.
[07:03.00]I should have called an Uber for grandma.
[07:05.54]Then this would- I should have just started with this.
[07:08.68]Instead of walking grandma across the street for a fucking hour.
[07:22.51]It's actually pretty tricky.
[07:29.42]Damn, the fucking forward momentum is so much.
[07:36.32]Okay, so where do I go?
[07:39.48]This doesn't open.
[07:40.12]Is it over here?
[07:43.37]Portal to Al.
[07:44.17]This is where we're going.
[07:44.87]Alright.
[07:46.27]Press tab for portal load.
[07:47.69]Well, that would have been nice.
[07:49.99]Domain of the Sentinels.
[07:52.46]Astral Equinox, which is going to go here.
[07:53.94]Alright.
[07:59.84]Autosave.
[08:00.72]Stronghold.

[08:44.88]Picked up a tiny soul.
[08:46.96]Increase the FOV.
[08:50.05]Should I do that?
[08:53.99]Where is it?
[08:54.59]Game...
[08:56.89]auto run input where is it hud I have to like sit I have to like go five feet back from my in my on my desk to see it video down here for no that's frame limit actually by the way red set fov right here okay anything more than 95 will make me probably throw up

[09:32.23]Yeah, that's kind of pushing it already.
[09:35.37]Alright, what is health?

[10:34.22]Both left and right.
[10:35.34]Okay.
[10:37.93]You need the gold key, you need the silver key.
[10:42.95]Alright, let's go over here.
[11:15.62]Oh my god, I'm getting overwhelmed.
[11:19.50]I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
[11:24.59]I'm not kidding.
[11:25.47]It's like the screen flashes.
[11:26.79]Can he turn those off?
[11:30.58]I really think I'm going to puke.
[11:35.72]Where is it?
[11:37.93]Soul Glow?
[11:38.85]Is that it?
[11:46.93]Crosshair stuff.
[11:47.59]Show Crosshair.
[11:48.35]Okay, that's fine.
[11:50.30]HUD Scale.
[11:52.56]That's kind of big.
[11:54.54]Let's do this.
[11:58.10]Did that help?
[12:05.16]Soul, that's... What do you mean blind?
[12:13.09]I asked if it was soul glow.
[12:15.91]And everyone said yes.
[12:23.13]Show crosshair?
[12:31.28]Screen...
[12:35.35]I swear to god, it's hard to read this font.
[12:38.25]It's like a different language.
[12:39.23]That feels a little better.
[12:55.06]Oh, that's so much better.
[12:56.14]Okay, now I can actually pay attention.
[13:10.29]What do you guys want me to do now?
[13:13.87]Go to video?
[13:20.20]Turn down the FOV.
[13:23.40]Message size?
[13:24.32]I feel like there's a lot you have to do to get this to be at a decent viewable state.
[13:35.50]Alternative message font?
[13:44.66]V-sync friendly all anti blah blah blah anti where is it is it hud alternative message font yeah it doesn't change the menu though
[14:22.41]Bring the soul glow on.
[14:23.97]Should I?
[14:24.37]This looks like a different enemy.
[14:31.69]Wait, yes!
[14:32.47]Let's just go back to hand simulator.
[14:53.43]Maybe I should take out the axes?
[14:55.19]You have a lot of health.
[15:09.36]Alright, there's the gold key.
[15:19.42]These have a little bit of homing on them, don't they?
[15:22.61]They do.
[15:24.57]Alright, gold key was back down here.
[15:33.67]Where was it?
[15:34.09]It's the same kind of system as Dusk, huh?
[15:36.58]I didn't get... Oh, I didn't... Wait.
[15:42.06]I left... Okay, gold key, right?
[15:43.62]Oh, shit.
[15:52.21]And then you go up here.
[16:01.86]Plus, alt fire to engage soul power.
[16:11.38]Holy shit.
[16:17.38]Uhhh.
[16:20.15]Uhhh!
[16:21.64]How long does this last?
[16:22.74]I picked up medium green mana.
[16:28.72]Okay, what was that thing that I just picked up?
[16:39.72]I'm almost dead.
[16:42.84]Souls are hard to see because you turn the glow off.
[16:50.71]I'll try it.
[17:00.45]Is there a quick save?
[17:01.83]I feel like I'm gonna- I had one save point and now I'm fucking terrified.
[17:05.04]I gotta do this.
[17:08.40]Alright, what is this?
[17:14.96]F6?
[17:15.02]Let's do a hard save here.
[17:20.59]Uhhh, new save.
[17:24.67]Let's see.
[17:27.14]input change bindings crouch is c run is left shift but it's toggling walk move forward wsd next weapon mouse wheel quick save f5 okay axe is one so I'm sure there's probably a reason why you wouldn't use the stick versus the axe
[17:57.78]Fire upon the red rune.
[18:02.62]Yes, I will.
[18:16.23]Save it.
[18:18.08]Axe?
[18:19.02]Oh, fuck.
[18:20.08]I'm dead.
[18:21.82]Does he come down here?
[18:28.28]I feel like this is gonna do a lot of damage, but I'm scared.
[18:29.92]I don't know how much damage it's doing.
[18:35.83]Ow, fuck.
[18:38.31]That does a lot.
[18:42.37]Alright, there's the silver key.
[18:47.56]And, uh, you picked up a huge soul and a mo- what are the souls- what are the souls for?
[18:58.32]Push that and bring that back up here.
[18:59.38]Wait, was there another door or anything?
[19:08.07]So it was for the rapid fire thing.
[19:09.57]Okay.
[19:09.73]Alright.
[19:11.81]Let's go.
[19:15.77]Whoa!
[19:23.79]Wait, he's still alive?
[19:27.13]Locking the ship?
[19:27.97]Alright, motherfucker, let's go.
[19:31.93]Uh-oh.
[19:38.29]Got him.
[19:41.11]These things are throwing grenades at me.
[19:48.47]Alright, quick save.
[19:50.39]Let's go.
[19:51.49]Can I make this jump?
[20:01.59]Oh, it's down there.
[20:02.39]Uh, let's go this way first.
[20:11.22]You got a weapon?
[20:14.12]Shit.
[20:15.82]What is this thing?
[20:17.72]Ooh, that's kinda cool.
[20:22.49]Holy fuck, there's a lot of people.
[20:24.15]Couldn't even get the health.
[20:35.97]I feel like this is better for these guys.
[20:37.11]Yeah, it is.
[20:46.30]By a lot.
[20:48.50]Alright, big guy's still up there.
[20:49.42]I'm maxing the big guy.
[20:50.26]Is he dead?
[20:57.01]Alright, easy.
[20:58.21]Use the Whisper's Edge wisely.
[20:59.55]It may strike many foes at once.
[21:01.11]So we can go through people.
[21:11.36]Alright, what do I want to go from here?
[21:12.81]This way.
[21:14.83]Should I go that way?
[21:15.95]Maybe I should go that way.
[21:16.79]That's probably a key.
[21:20.22]Um, no, no.
[21:39.30]Oh, alright.
[21:39.84]I see what you're trying to do here.
[21:40.62]You're trying to kill me.
[21:41.26]I have a lot of mana.
[21:51.84]What should I use it for?
[21:54.66]Picked up.
[21:55.26]Press alt.
[21:55.68]Okay.
[21:56.10]Soul power.
[21:57.36]Not yet.
[21:57.66]Not yet.
[22:01.28]Not yet.
[22:01.60]Not yet.
[22:01.90]Go back.
[22:02.28]Go back.
[22:02.50]Go back.
[22:02.76]Go back.
[22:03.00]Go back.
[22:12.00]Does Soul Power do anything with the axe, dude?
[22:14.15]I'm sure it does.
[22:16.73]That hurt.
[22:18.99]Yeah.
[22:24.73]Yeah, man, that is just ammo.
[22:26.03]And these take different types of... Okay, I see.
[22:28.61]Cool.
[22:38.13]Pretty sick!
[22:40.09]Ooh, shoot this!
[22:50.65]Are there bosses in this game?
[22:58.08]Ooh, are there?
[23:07.39]Fuck.
[23:09.71]Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, this is a different guy.
[23:11.19]No it's not.
[23:14.73]What is this?
[23:15.57]Oh, the thing I activated, right?
[23:23.61]Use Soul Power?
[23:24.73]Not yet, hold on.
[23:27.59]Platform to Bastion of the Blue Moon.
[23:36.12]Can you alt-fire?
[23:37.24]Alt-firing does... Does super move.
[23:43.90]Oh, what was that?
[23:46.14]What the fuck was on the ceiling?
[23:52.62]You guys remember when he was walking his grandma?
[23:54.40]I do.
[24:03.08]Bastion of the Blue Moon.
[24:04.97]Let's go.
[24:10.07]Eight and a nine secrets found?
[24:12.21]Not quite.
[24:16.76]There's no bunny hopping in this?
[24:17.68]I don't think there is.
[24:19.20]Doesn't look like it.
[24:28.62]I like the soul power of this.
[24:30.28]Why even use any of the weapons?
[24:38.54]It's Dusk without guns.
[24:39.56]Sort of.
[24:44.70]Like, don't just blow through everything.
[24:45.84]I need to be able to... I need to see what I'm doing.
[24:47.70]Ooh, what's this?
[24:57.43]The other weapon's soul power is a good two?
[24:59.25]Sick.
[25:04.42]Okay.
[25:10.92]That's pretty good.
[25:17.93]Are we doing like a wand battle?
[25:19.11]Okay, it's blocked.
[25:21.17]It does block it.
[25:28.50]What Skyrim mod is this?
[25:29.54]It's called Into the Abyss 1.1.
[25:33.86]What was that?
[25:41.41]That is almost quick save though, Into the Soft Block.
[25:48.54]What the fuck was next to me?
[25:50.78]Alright, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, slow down.
[25:56.52]Alright, I have a question.
[25:57.80]I have a question!
[26:00.80]Is it like Pokémon?
[26:04.02]Do green enemies take more damage from something else?
[26:07.36]Does red enemies take more damage from blue?
[26:12.24]Or does it not matter?
[26:13.78]Does it not matter?
[26:18.14]Because I have red, green, blue.
[26:21.37]Does it matter?
[26:22.97]You can enslave them in a cube.
[26:27.97]What?
[26:31.78]Wait, he'll... Can I jump to this?
[26:37.92]What do you guys think?
[26:45.67]Ahhhh.
[26:56.02]Yeah, this is like magician dust.
[27:08.56]Doesn't seem to be a health cap.
[27:09.98]Uh-oh.
[27:21.91]The levels are stranded together, so yes, this is a strand game.
[27:28.79]Why?
[27:29.51]Why?
[27:30.21]Strand game.
[27:51.91]Dammit, I took way too many hits.
[28:00.05]Alright, let me- I wanna try out the super move for this.
[28:09.82]But, not yet.
[28:10.67]It's gonna be more than one person to sprint.
[28:23.21]Engage the Soul Power?
[28:24.24]Eventually.
[28:25.42]I will defi- Ooh, what?
[28:27.16]Look.
[28:30.26]Can't pick this up.
[28:33.00]What's the big cube for?
[28:33.94]Dude, there's a huge cube over there.
[28:38.81]There's a fucking huge cube.
[28:40.17]Do I have full mana?
[28:48.05]Yeah, I do.
[28:50.86]Oh, okay.
[28:55.46]It looks like two fifties of max for everything.
[28:58.66]Probably, yeah.
[29:00.20]Probably, yup.
[29:01.74]Maybe, yeah.
[29:02.36]Alright, I'm going for it.
[29:11.35]Oh, fuck, this is pretty cool.
[29:13.09]Um... They just bounce around?
[29:21.33]Sacred?
[29:24.64]Turn it off!
[29:25.38]Turn it off!
[29:25.98]Turn it off!
[29:36.67]I like the wand the best so far.
[29:38.18]It reminds me of Arcane Missiles in World of Warcraft.
[29:57.26]If I see another -2, I will delete you!
[30:06.64]Those who would worship the sun are blind.
[30:11.76]Those who would worship the sun...
[30:27.25]No, don't do it.
[30:29.23]I was gonna... I was gonna say it.
[30:34.50]I walked Grandma across the street for an hour and a half earlier, so I can't... I gotta start to pull this back together.
[30:52.67]Do I have a soul thing yet?
[30:54.89]They're throwing grenades from below.
[30:56.17]Alright, I'm going this way.
[31:01.59]Oh, fuck.
[31:02.31]Oh, never mind, never mind, never mind.
[31:03.43]Give me this.
[31:16.73]Wish I had it now!
[31:30.08]Alright, I got it back.
[31:33.42]Should I do the Axis time?
[31:34.27]Let me see what the Axis power is.
[31:38.09]What was that?
[31:44.59]Somebody's, like, flying around over there.
[31:56.66]I got the gold key.
[32:06.07]Does anyone remember where the gold door is?
[32:09.49]I don't.
[32:09.93]Where's the gold door?
[32:16.37]I don't know.
[32:16.95]Down here?
[32:17.49]Does it back down this way?
[32:24.61]This isn't gonna kill me, isn't it?
[32:26.25]If I drop from here, will this hurt?
[32:27.81]How bad will it hurt?
[32:35.00]Not terribly.
[32:38.29]Alright, gold door.
[32:43.27]Did I go this way yet?
[32:45.56]Yeah.
[32:46.14]Was it back in here?
[32:50.62]This is the... those are the works towards the sun.
[33:08.84]Where was it?
[33:09.30]I feel like we don't have to go back that far for this.
[33:16.66]Gold door, gold door, gold door, gold door.
[33:23.15]Gold door?
[33:26.45]Not a gold door, but some secret, I guess.
[33:34.92]Okay.
[33:41.66]Not that way.
[33:44.08]Shit.
[33:44.84]Where's this thing?
[33:46.78]Is it up there?
[33:56.56]Gold.
[33:58.46]Looking for gold, looking for gold, looking for gold.
[34:05.01]No, get off screen.
[34:10.29]Back to hand simulator door.
[34:12.06]Alright, that looks like something I haven't seen.
[34:26.69]Gold ore?
[34:33.85]Gold ore!
[34:35.81]Where's gold ore?
[34:42.19]Well, I found a green door.
[34:44.09]Can I open this?
[34:57.24]Is this more obvious than I'm... This is water.
[35:03.18]Ummm...
[35:13.69]I've been down here.
[35:14.71]Did I look at it?
[35:26.40]What?
[35:32.45]Into the water?
[35:57.23]There it is.
[35:57.97]That's a gold, right?
[35:58.52]Gold!
[35:58.84]Right?
[35:59.06]3, 2, 1, GO!
[36:16.72]You just turn into a meat grinder.
[36:18.06]This is ridiculous.
[36:18.68]You gotta get close to people though.
[36:22.18]I'm not sure I like it.
[36:23.01]Come on, hit him.
[36:35.85]Hit him with something.
[36:41.55]Alright, give me the green door.
[36:44.99]Why the fuck are you still alive?
[36:55.16]Alright.
[36:59.38]Now what?

[37:58.89]That's fucking sick.
[38:01.03]Nice work.
[38:03.15]But you might be lying to me though, did you find it?
[38:05.94]I don't know man, you might be lying to me.

[40:29.28]It's all good.
[40:29.86]It's alright.
[40:30.34]It's alright.
[40:30.64]You get it back really quickly.
[40:31.88]Now we can leave the game, right?
[40:33.24]It's the end of the level.
[40:46.10]One secret.
[40:46.90]It's alright.
[40:53.08]Devs here?
[40:56.38]Really?
[40:56.68]What's up?
[41:04.64]They chain together.
[41:13.90]That's pretty cool.
[41:14.78]I like it.
[41:15.38]But not as much as I like this weapon.
[41:22.90]He's playing the game terribly.
[41:26.43]No, no, no, no.
[41:27.71]Let's let the devs of Greendor be able to tell us what they think.
[41:32.13]You don't have to put words in their mouth.
[41:44.76]There's Poseidon's staff.
[41:52.44]Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
[41:54.30]What does it say?
[41:59.16]Our leader, guardian of the moon, he now dreams of death and pain.
[42:06.22]Alright, hold on.
[42:23.88]Alright, pay attention, pay attention, pay attention, pay attention.
[42:35.40]I don't wanna fuck this up.
[42:39.76]Ooh!

[42:43.57]Zap him!
[42:48.93]Chain him.
[42:50.13]Guy coming around.
[42:59.17]Not that effective.
[43:01.45]Sword actually, I think, is pretty effective.
[43:08.63]Uh, guys, is there any leveling up in this game?
[43:18.92]What's this say?
[43:26.74]says uh midnight moonlight not today I gotta get over there uh
[43:58.96]Imagine having the scroll wheel as a game.
[44:08.91]I have to get in here.
[44:09.71]Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[44:13.66]Go, go, kill.
[44:14.46]Go, go, kill.
[44:15.22]Wait, don't touch that.
[44:16.96]I'm gonna activate Super Machine Gun.
[44:31.56]Now grab this.
[44:32.86]Ooh, I got it twice!
[44:41.48]See?
[44:41.74]I timed it.
[44:53.11]Unlimited Zap.
[44:59.17]He wants to play Hand Simulator?
[45:02.12]I do.
[45:04.66]No, I do.
[45:07.26]You're not wrong.
[45:15.24]But playing hand simulator gets the same reaction as to if I took a dump on my desk on camera.
[45:24.54]It would be the same.
[45:25.26]You could open up the chat and it would be the same thing.
[45:32.72]Get this out of here!
[45:34.76]What the fuck reported this suck?
[45:39.76]Disgusting!
[45:40.65]Get rid of him!
[45:47.87]Where do I go?
[45:48.33]How about this way?
[46:04.62]What is this?
[46:05.10]Like a grenade launcher?
[46:09.98]Don't use a planet launcher.
[46:11.11]They only have 15 bullets.
[46:14.79]How do I get up there?
[46:15.33]I need something with mana.
[46:24.68]This...
[46:37.40]Oh shit.
[46:42.86]Evil, evil, evil.
[46:45.06]Oh boy, get off.
[46:54.92]Where you going?
[46:55.44]10 community subs just came in from a Wild Merrill.
[46:58.98]Thank you, Wild Merrill.
[47:02.09]Thanks for the subs.
[47:04.46]And, uh, grats to everybody that just got one.
[47:15.55]Wait, don't leave yet.
[47:20.37]What do we got here?
[47:22.30]Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[47:28.19]What did that do?
[47:28.89]That opened up the middle portion.
[47:30.27]Too hard to get sneakies in there.
[47:39.31]Down even.
[47:39.93]Alright, get that.
[47:41.46]What does that do?
[47:42.74]I missed.
[47:50.34]Shit.
[47:53.70]What?
[47:56.74]Does it have to be one of the balls?
[48:01.50]Oh, damn it.
[48:07.71]Oh, damn it.
[48:09.77]That's a health orb?
[48:11.49]Oh, okay.
[48:12.79]I don't know.
[48:14.19]I just wanted to see if you knew.
[48:28.80]Full blue mana.
[48:30.00]Nice.
[48:30.20]I'll take out the electricity.
[48:46.03]Full mana, empty brain.
[48:47.25]Wait, didn't everything drop honey?
[48:51.71]Where is it?
[49:01.15]By the moon, I feel worried.
[49:04.25]You're good.
[49:05.33]What's that?
[49:07.09]Secret?
[49:22.74]Is the stream title Innuendo?
[49:24.96]What is the stream title?
[49:28.16]Oh, it's still something about hand simulator.
[49:32.36]Chillin' out with my hands.
[49:33.86]Right, right.
[49:34.40]Okay.
[49:34.88]That doesn't make any sense.
[49:35.68]Well, I guess it sort of does.
[49:38.74]Like, I'm... I guess I am.
[49:41.84]I don't know.
[49:43.00]It's too late to change it now.
[49:45.24]Is there a torch upgrade?
[49:47.26]Where's the torch thing?
[49:50.55]You know what?
[49:54.15]Let's go.
[49:57.93]Just bounce this shit around everywhere.
[50:01.78]That'll hit somebody.
[50:06.58]Okay, now we... Can we light, light, light, light, please?
[50:16.97]Oh, I think it has activated something.
[50:27.40]Oh, no, no, no.
[50:31.78]Wait.
[50:33.20]No.
[50:33.28]Alright, I'm just going to go up.
[50:36.86]Wait.
[50:37.72]I'm going to put the planet gun, which I haven't even used once.
[50:42.91]Let's try it.
[50:47.61]It's pretty great, actually.
[50:49.83]Absolutely worth using.
[50:52.33]Never.
[50:53.94]Only when I'm in danger.
[50:57.70]What's this?
[50:59.30]Nothing.
[51:10.37]I'm not using the melee at all.
[51:12.55]I don't feel like I shouldn't even have to.
[51:13.77]Don't get killed.
[51:26.21]Don't get killed now, don't get killed.
[51:36.22]Bingo!
[51:36.66]How loud do you think I can get as I can say bingo without actually springing?
[51:56.00]Like, not like... No, no, not like... No.
[52:03.11]Like... Without actually screaming, screaming.
[52:15.40]I can probably go pretty loud.
[52:16.16]Alright, I'm going back this way.
[52:26.28]That just now was not screaming.
[52:27.50]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[52:32.93]Just keep going up?
[52:34.39]Lord!

[52:47.37]Bing sellout stream.
[52:50.80]Bing.
[52:54.89]When was the last time you guys opened up Google to use Bing?
[52:59.00]No, not Google.
[52:59.44]That's not a web browser.
[53:00.16]When was the last time you opened up Bing?
[53:07.46]You've never even opened it?
[53:08.52]Yes, you have.
[53:10.22]You've at least opened Bing to see what it was all about.
[53:25.50]I have.
[53:27.46]It's better... I'm not even going to read that.
[53:40.41]It's not... I... I can't read what you just said.
[53:45.86]Please forgive me!
[54:01.28]This game's pretty fun.

[56:11.26]This is a, uh... Boss room.
[56:15.48]This is definitely a boss room.
[56:16.90]No way it's not a boss room.
[56:20.66]I will eat fucking dinner tonight if this is not a boss room.
[56:25.01]And I will... Whatever, you know what I'm saying.

[56:38.97]Ow.
[56:41.02]I didn't save it.
[56:41.58]I have to win.

[57:36.06]I'm so fucking pissed off right now.
[57:37.88]You know how many times I've actually seen that message?
[57:49.20]At least like five times.
[57:56.01]Fuck this.
[57:56.91]He just beat that boss.
[57:58.37]It took me like an hour to beat that guy.
[58:00.07]Fuck this stream.
[58:00.87]I'm out of here.
[58:01.47]Alright, we're good.

[58:38.62]More than -2 doesn't count, so sorry, that's not going to work.
[58:45.53]I didn't even get a secret here.
[58:47.51]What was it?
[58:50.05]Don't ever do that again.
[58:50.81]I'll make sure to do that five to ten more times before I die.
[58:58.59]I'm gonna be- don't ever do that.
[58:59.57]I'm gonna be on my deathbed.
[59:00.57]I'm gonna be fucking- I'm gonna be 97 years old.

[66:05.18]There's a button to press.
[66:06.38]Here comes the enemies, I think.
[66:09.12]I think.
[66:11.50]No?
[66:11.74]It was an elevator.
[66:22.54]This brings me back up here.
[66:26.44]Through the glass?
[66:27.14]Okay, well I have the electricity gun now.
[66:34.15]Did I get a key?
[66:34.97]Did I remember if I got a key?

[67:00.15]Let's... Okay... Still dead?
[67:08.53]Is he alive?
[67:09.30]Ow.
[67:18.72]Alright.
[67:25.16]Uh...
[67:30.15]That's gonna open.
[67:32.75]What is that?
[67:33.17]I don't like this room.
[67:37.48]This is a new weapon.
[67:38.20]What is it, crystal?
[67:39.14]Star of Torment.
[67:42.14]Ooh, I actually like this.
[67:46.44]What was that?
[67:55.11]Uh...
[67:59.75]Holy shit, this thing's amazing.
[68:08.30]Damn, this is great.
[68:11.93]This might be better than the, um... What's its super move, I wonder?
[68:15.97]Let's try it.
[68:32.30]What do we got?
[68:32.68]Anybody?
[68:33.50]Bounce some shit around?
[68:34.24]Alright, I gotta slow down.
[68:42.99]How are my bones?
[68:44.95]Uh, they're alright.
[68:48.51]Well, actually, that might not even be true.
[68:56.70]What the fuck hit me?
[69:02.38]Um... What did I just do?
[69:09.25]Bad bones.
[69:13.93]Well, I might have costal chondritis.
[69:16.83]Which is, my ribs are fucked up.
[69:19.05]And my, like, cartilage in my ribs is inflamed.
[69:23.37]Well, that sucks, but, you know, whatever.
[69:27.09]Perfection is power!
[69:29.49]Order is perfection.
[69:33.70]Okay.
[69:41.73]Uh, where do I... I just opened something here, didn't I?
[69:48.43]Secret area, I guess that's what I opened.
[69:52.69]Or is there something I can do over here?
[69:55.29]What's going on?
[69:57.27]No?
[70:05.66]Wasn't I just looking down in this area?
[70:13.74]Wait a minute, I went all the way around.
[70:19.70]Uh... Does the dream please wake up?
[70:29.55]No, I have a fucking hernia.
[70:32.31]And...
[70:34.27]I also think I have fucking costochondritis, which essentially is your rib bones.
[70:40.75]It's just like, your rib cage just hurts.
[70:44.78]That's pretty much what it is.
[70:46.40]That's pretty much it.
[70:51.54]When your testicle goes up into your stomach, you need to read a few medicine books.
[71:01.32]What that is.
[71:02.88]By the way, where the fuck have I gone?
[71:04.50]I remember I pressed a button here.
[71:15.07]Where am I going?
[71:23.19]I don't think I've been over this way.
[71:31.79]Oh, there we go.
[71:33.79]I... Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[71:35.85]Let me on, let me on.
[71:38.23]Do I just keep moving fast, I think?
[71:40.05]Probably?
[71:40.45]Alright, I did it.
[71:54.99]Alright, I gotta switch.
[72:00.88]This is the best weapon in the game.
[72:02.74]It kills them instantly.
[72:04.24]One hit on these guys and they're dead.
[72:12.76]120, 120, 130, 130, 140, 140, 120, 120.
[72:12.92]Alright, I'm gonna... I got 20 of these shots.
[72:17.42]Alright, what's next?
[72:29.02]Another button?
[72:30.02]Oh, no, another elevator.
[72:33.58]Turmeric?
[72:34.02]Yeah, I've kind of been on that train.
[72:43.54]Turmeric tease!
[72:47.29]Depending on if that's really what's going on, I might have to go get, like, an injection.
[72:54.51]I've looked up a bunch of stuff.
[72:55.63]Trust me, I mean, the last three or four days has been pretty much only me looking up what the fuck any of this stuff even means.
[73:10.90]Injury injection.
[73:13.84]Not necessarily.
[73:15.08]No, no.
[73:18.25]Oh my god!
[73:25.65]Who's left?
[73:27.83]Sequence complete.
[73:31.41]Alright, wait, don't leave anything behind here.
[73:47.09]Oh shit, that was it.
[73:50.73]50% of the secrets completed.
[73:58.72]Is the bitrate suffering?
[74:00.82]Is it the way that the game is encoded into Twitch?
[74:03.64]Let me see.
[74:04.24]What's it going at right now?
[74:12.35]Yeah, I'm at 6,000 up.
[74:16.34]I think it just looks like that.
[74:19.60]Yeah, it just looks like that.
[74:30.99]This game is 3D.
[74:33.65]Yeah, I know.
[74:34.09]It's pretty good.
[74:37.79]Thanks a lot, Jeremy.
[74:38.47]Now I have boomer eyes.
[74:43.09]You'll be alright.
[74:44.27]Trust me.
[74:48.93]Do you even trust me?
[74:50.67]Does anybody in this chat actually trust me?
[74:55.28]Do you trust me?
[74:55.82]Alright, so if we were doing an experiment where I stood behind you and you had to close your eyes and put your hands across your chest and fall backwards and I catch you, do you think I would catch you?
[75:13.90]You don't.
[75:24.61]Well, I would, okay?
[75:27.61]Think about it.
[75:29.95]And then I would make a decision.
[75:33.57]How do I get this to go down?
[75:46.46]Oh, shit.
[75:50.67]Chaos begets destruction.
[75:58.39]Sure.
[75:58.73]Did I get him?
[76:07.27]Got him.
[76:09.53]Got him too.
[76:10.01]Alright, I gotta go up.
[76:12.31]Do I have to jump around?
[76:13.31]Nice dodge.
[76:18.52]It's safer to fall forward.
[76:19.68]Yeah, but that's not the... The whole point of the test is to see if you trust me that I will catch you if you fall backwards.
[76:27.17]Would it actually be safer if you fell forward?
[76:28.73]What if you didn't get caught?
[76:29.57]You'd smash your fucking mouth on the ground.
[76:40.00]It's either lose all your teeth or smash the back of your head.
[76:44.18]What's worse?
[76:50.82]Oh, please.
[76:51.82]Come on.
[76:54.56]What the fuck just hit me?
[76:56.44]Oh, fuck.
[76:56.94]I'm gonna die.
[76:57.90]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[76:58.98]No, not fall damage.
[76:59.84]I'm fine.
[77:02.14]I need health.
[77:03.68]Oh, fuck you.
[77:09.54]There's two of these motherfuckers.
[77:16.45]Health.
[77:17.83]Please.
[77:20.07]Thank you.
[77:20.87]I can't reach this.
[77:22.15]Oh, please.
[77:22.71]Yes, I can.
[77:27.16]Alright, we're good.
[77:32.88]For now.
[77:38.11]Through, through, through, through, through.
[77:40.79]You!
[77:41.21]Bunch of dicks.
[77:49.40]I bet you have a severe case of gamer neck right now.
[77:52.80]No, I have to be aware of my gamer neck.
[77:55.90]Oh boy.
[77:57.64]What do I do here?
[77:58.94]What do I do here?
[77:59.54]Fuck.
[78:03.32]I'm dead.
[78:03.64]I'm dead.
[78:03.89]I'm dead.
[78:04.07]I'm dead.
[78:05.15]Oh no.
[78:05.61]When was the last time I saved?
[78:09.61]I don't know.
[78:11.79]I have no idea.
[78:14.09]It's been a while, I think.
[78:21.81]Not that long.
[78:23.71]You know, I really do have to be aware of my posture and stuff.
[78:35.58]Because the more strain I put on my ribcage, the worse this can get.
[78:39.27]I'm so scared of these guys, they don't have very much health.
[78:57.49]Save it here But I'll tell you it's been a real pain in the ass So hopefully over the next few weeks or a couple months or so start to figure out ways to alleviate it
[79:17.94]Because damn is it really irritating just having like a painful... all of your ribs just hurt every day.
[79:24.92]Like that sucks.
[79:25.92]That's not cool.
[79:42.33]Originally we thought it was something to do with my intestinal problems, but nope.
[79:47.59]Apparently not.
[79:48.67]Apparently not.
[79:49.87]Alright, easy.
[79:59.65]Okay.
[80:02.59]One more, one more.
[80:09.03]Where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where?
[80:19.35]Is that good?
[80:19.83]I think so.
[80:23.37]Alright, save it.
[80:26.93]Somebody fill me in on what he's talking about.
[80:28.27]Uh, alright, we'll go, we'll break it down a little bit here.
[80:31.14]Alright, so, like a year ago, I started to get this weird, like, back pain.
[80:36.74]It was on the right side of my back.
[80:39.54]And it was kind of flanking around the right side of my abdomen.
[80:43.89]Uh, what the fuck's wrong with you?
[80:45.53]So obviously he went to the doctor.
[80:47.57]Well, I don't know.
[80:48.75]And then my, like, stomach started to hurt.
[80:50.39]My, like, chest started to hurt, too.
[80:52.93]Like, my sternum.
[80:54.13]So my, like, whole abdomen and all wrapping around the right side of my back just fucking, just was hurting all the time.
[81:00.51]I couldn't do anything about it.
[81:01.60]I never turned off.
[81:02.98]It never got worse, and it never got better.
[81:05.56]So we did colonoscopy.
[81:06.84]Maybe it's something to do with your colitis.
[81:09.22]You have, like, you've had a irritable bowel disease for pretty much the last 12 years.
[81:13.66]Maybe it's that.
[81:14.54]Nope.
[81:15.12]That's doing just fine.
[81:16.20]Well, as fine as that can be doing, right?
[81:19.40]Alright, well, let's try this.
[81:20.29]Let's test with this.
[81:20.95]Test with that.
[81:21.53]Test, test, test, test, test, test, test, test, test, test.
[81:24.17]And then I had a... This is three days ago now.
[81:27.77]I had an upper endoscopy done, where they looked at my stomach and everything, and they said, you have a hernia.
[81:32.86]That's number one.
[81:33.80]That might be causing it.
[81:34.60]And then number two, I think you have this.
[81:37.22]I think it's your ribcage.
[81:38.48]I'm like, alright, you think it's my ribcage?
[81:40.04]You sure?
[81:40.40]Give me some evidence.
[81:42.51]And he said, I don't have any.
[81:44.01]I'm not a doctor.
[81:45.58]We're in my garage right now.
[81:48.94]And I went, oh.
[81:50.48]Right, right, right.
[81:51.96]You're Larry.
[82:08.47]The hernia is going to fuck you up pretty bad.
[82:10.05]Hopefully the rib fucks are a false alarm.
[82:12.61]Yeah, I know.
[82:13.65]It just sucks.
[82:14.93]Because if you have a high-end hernia, mine's apparently not that bad.
[82:20.93]But it doesn't go away.
[82:24.35]You just have to manage it and keep an eye on it and change your lifestyle a little bit.
[82:28.89]More healthy eating.
[82:30.36]Don't eat before bed.
[82:31.66]And you have to have surgery.
[82:33.60]You have to have laryngoscopic surgery.
[82:35.74]It's a damn thing.
[82:36.48]So it's annoying.
[82:40.23]But, apparently it's not that serious.
[82:47.23]It's just kind of annoying.
[82:51.77]That's pretty much it.
[83:03.04]I feel like the eye- no, they didn't.
[83:06.26]You had a hernia before and they were fucking painful?
[83:08.50]Yeah!
[83:10.40]It's just... How do I get that?
[83:15.04]But I'm not certain of a... I'm certain, obviously, they did an endoscopy.
[83:19.11]You have a hernia.
[83:19.97]It's like, that's clear as day.
[83:23.81]And the rib cage thing would make sense.
[83:26.97]It just would.
[83:27.53]It just would.
[83:32.34]So, whatever.
[83:33.10]I'm just gonna keep doing it.
[83:34.80]Whatever.
[83:35.10]Keep going.
[83:36.32]Figure it out.
[83:37.68]Manage it.
[83:38.10]What do I need to do?
[83:38.74]Let's do that.
[83:39.40]Fine.
[83:39.72]Alright.
[83:43.93]He ripped me out of the wood.
[83:47.23]They feel like it sometimes.
[83:48.59]Give me the key.
[84:08.54]They creak as you breathe.
[84:11.02]Like, if I lean back, and I put my fingers, like, on my sternum, and I, like, kind of lean back and pull a little, somebody's kind of following me.
[84:18.50]It's just like, oh!
[84:21.69]And I have said to random doctors before, you know, if I just, like, could pull, pick up my ribcage and, like, pull it apart by, like, 10%, I feel like my whole problem would go away.
[84:33.33]I've said that out loud before.
[84:36.65]so it I don't know maybe it's pressure and inflammation in the rib cage I don't know I'm not a doctor I have the key now silver key was back here it was down or was it I remember seeing it I remember looking at it the doctor goes well no no Jeremy that's not that's not a good idea
[85:14.51]Are you spawning, bro?
[85:19.35]I'd like to not use, but where are you?
[85:23.49]Who the fuck are you?
[85:36.18]That's what I wanted, just that.
[85:40.39]Ooh, it's so precise, but ooh, so got it.
[85:52.02]I remember initially, this is the, okay, a lot of you guys can probably relate to this, I'm sure.
[85:56.46]I'm sure most people can relate to this.
[85:59.38]But, when this all started, it's like, you know when you're like certain of something?
[86:09.81]And you're like, this has to, I thought I had lime to be completely upfront.
[86:16.52]Which is like, I read a, you know, test me for lime, you don't have lime.
[86:20.00]Fuck, well what is wrong with me then?
[86:24.02]I think I might have a bacterial infection.
[86:25.99]Check it.
[86:26.43]Nope, you don't.
[86:27.07]Fuck!
[86:29.23]What do you think I have?
[86:30.15]We can test for this, too.
[86:31.05]Maybe you have this inflammatory arthritis disease.
[86:34.73]Alright, do it.
[86:35.25]Please.
[86:35.66]Is this it?
[86:37.38]Nope.
[86:40.64]What the fuck is going on?
[86:57.62]Turns out my stomach is pushing up into my diaphragm in my hiatal esophageal area.
[87:02.92]That's problem number one.
[87:06.10]Unfortunately.
[87:06.88]Surgery is the only way to get rid of it, and mine's apparently not bad enough to have surgery on.
[87:11.95]So... Fuck!
[87:20.97]So now what?
[87:21.55]Now what do you do?
[87:26.04]You just have to, I don't know, you just have to keep doing whatever you're doing to try to figure out what the fuck is wrong with you.
[87:38.13]I need health.
[87:39.29]That's most important.
[87:48.64]The human body sucks.
[87:49.64]Yeah, one of you is gonna replace all of my, like, our parts.
[87:56.43]I want to go to a car mechanic.
[87:58.34]For me to get like a new rib cage.
[88:02.26]Just let me lie on my back.
[88:03.84]Put me on one of those things that lift you all the way up into the air.
[88:07.50]At the car mechanic.
[88:12.91]And just look under there.
[88:14.33]And open up my back.
[88:15.31]Because there will be a panel back there.
[88:19.17]Power me down.
[88:19.93]And then just start replacing stuff.
[88:29.45]What's gonna open here?
[88:30.99]That.
[88:34.57]We need a new engine.
[88:37.25]Imagine if we ran- imagine if we ran on gasoline, you'd just chug gasoline.
[88:51.96]You went- you went to the tank instead of your car, you just like put your mouth on the nozzle and just like
[89:04.55]We've run on food.
[89:05.61]Yeah, but I mean if you had like an engine in your body... You could pull your cord like five times to like start again.
[89:21.80]How loud would the world be?
[89:25.96]I'm talking like... It would be horrible.
[89:36.91]That's all you'd be- it'd be like a swarm of bees everywhere, in every single neighborhood, in every single spot.
[89:41.03]I need a gold key for this.
[89:47.89]Everything would stink.
[89:51.86]Yeah, it would.
[89:52.54]Everything would be- it would smell like gasoline everywhere.
[89:58.80]You'd have to wa- yeah, you mute on your ear- yeah, you- no, not mute on your ears.
[90:01.86]Your ears are still your ears.
[90:03.35]You just run on gas.
[90:15.97]You wouldn't be able to ever have a phone call.
[90:19.69]But we wouldn't even need phone calls, because at that point you'd just be communicating through your... brain... I don't know, like, whatever Facebook is in a hundred years.
[90:31.44]Nothing else?
[90:32.68]This is key.
[90:38.12]Gold key, gold key, gold key.
[90:46.14]I don't know.
[90:46.96]Up there?
[90:48.14]Found it.
[90:53.09]How do I get up there?
[90:53.87]How do I get up there?
[90:56.81]How do I get up there?
[90:57.47]How do I get up here?
[91:01.41]Shit.
[91:01.73]How do I get up there?
[91:08.54]There's a little bridge over here?
[91:14.56]Oh, come on, I heard you.
[91:16.90]Is somebody invisible?
[91:26.53]No.
[91:30.85]Alright, get me up here.
[91:32.77]Speaking of hearing things, uh, I...
[91:38.14]I think I just heard Otto bark.
[91:40.65]He might need to... I might need to take care of him.
[91:44.49]I need to let him out or something.
[91:46.19]Can I actually rob him?
[91:47.21]No, no, no.
[91:47.65]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[91:51.36]He's over there.
[91:52.28]I'm gonna cross this way.
[91:57.66]This was the actual way.
[92:01.83]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[92:13.74]Yeah, I found it.
[92:14.72]Alright, cool.
[92:15.30]What's this?
[92:17.88]Purple mana?
[92:18.64]Do I even have anything purple?
[92:22.34]I don't think I have anything purple.
[92:26.26]Oh, shit.
[92:28.86]Oops.
[92:38.02]Utilize, utilize, utilize, utilize.
[92:39.72]Whoa, I'm going so fast.
[92:48.65]Why do these games have a tip wiggle when you move left and right?
[92:51.39]Realism.
[92:54.85]Let's get that key.
[92:57.31]Which is this way.
[93:00.76]I almost fell off.
[93:04.41]Easy, easy, easy.
[93:05.85]Ayy!
[93:07.19]Well, I guess we're going down.
[93:13.86]Save it here.
[93:17.74]Oh, shit!
[93:24.87]Our reality is the truth.
[93:29.31]Whatever you say.
[93:30.85]Show auto.
[93:31.89]Show auto.
[93:35.34]Our truth is all.
[93:39.70]Jesus.
[93:45.63]Three swings.
[93:49.61]Free Otto.
[93:50.37]Otto's just hanging out downstairs.
[93:55.31]Alright, alright, alright.
[93:56.29]Let me go free Otto.
[93:57.01]I'm gonna see what he wants.
[94:01.31]I will be right back.
[94:02.19]Give me two seconds.

[97:04.90]Did I get a key?
[97:15.12]I did.
[97:21.20]What did you feed him?
[97:22.86]He's dog food.
[97:23.52]Dog food.
[97:33.70]Ouch.
[97:34.32]Alright, hold on.
[97:34.84]Do I have a thing?
[97:37.64]Shit.
[97:40.02]I eat that.
[97:42.46]Ooh, dog food.
[97:43.28]Good.
[97:43.64]That's what I had today, too.
[97:44.76]What the fuck?
[97:49.18]Why?
[97:55.10]All has its place.
[97:56.54]I need to... I gotta change... I gotta change weapons.
[98:07.22]Oh, what kind of dog food did you give him?
[98:08.76]That's my favorite.
[98:11.56]Don't die.
[98:13.00]Don't!
[98:16.97]No.
[98:17.19]Yes.
[98:18.15]Do you guys want to know what Otto's dog food is?
[98:39.39]Okay.
[98:40.99]I didn't know this is some big thing we needed to know.
[98:45.29]Otto eats blue buffalo, the chicken, and brown rice formula.
[98:56.58]That's his favorite.
[99:06.41]I think this is gonna be something that comes out of this door.
[99:12.40]Wait, is it chicken and rice?
[99:14.08]No, wait, no, it's not.
[99:15.20]Is it?
[99:15.40]Maybe it's sweet potato.
[99:19.24]It's the blue bag.
[99:23.30]What do I do?
[99:24.39]I'm going to use my super move.
[99:28.45]Where is it?
[99:28.75]What number is it?
[99:30.53]Five?
[99:31.23]Yeah, it's five.
[99:31.75]Okay.
[99:32.81]Fifty of these fucking things.
[99:36.24]Chicken and rice.
[99:36.84]Okay, yeah, I got it right.
[99:38.42]So, up there.
[99:39.00]I guess I'm going up there.
[99:43.42]Doesn't even know it's dog's favorite food.
[99:46.48]I do.
[99:48.47]I do.
[99:48.77]Alright, how do we get over- Is this button I gotta press somewhere?
[99:52.57]I saw it, where was it?
[99:54.89]Shit.
[99:57.15]Oh, I gotta step on one of those buttons.
[100:00.69]Dammit.
[100:01.45]I saw it too.
[100:02.43]I know where I saw it.
[100:03.75]Where was it?
[100:09.39]It was one of these buttons.
[100:13.17]Shit.
[100:24.12]There it is.
[100:27.53]All has its place.
[100:31.71]Pressed the blue button.
[100:33.77]Blue button low.
[100:43.59]Bullshit.
[100:50.04]Button low.
[100:50.62]I'm so sorry.
[100:51.32]Zero secrets.
[100:52.16]I might as well fucking just never stream again.
[100:54.24]Thank god you stopped playing the hand game.
[100:58.45]That was a long time ago.
[100:59.83]That was at least like an hour and 40 minutes ago.
[101:12.38]Hand simulator.
[101:16.32]But remember, this is an extra stream this week.
[101:19.66]This doesn't count.
[101:20.22]This is not an actual stream.
[101:23.79]This is a fake stream.
[101:36.54]Because tomorrow...
[101:39.75]Joel and I are gonna play Halo Reach.
[101:45.39]And after that, it's gonna be another co-op experience.
[102:00.86]This is like the week of co-op.
[102:03.68]And hand simula- I had to- look.
[102:07.20]I know a lot of people are gonna say, dude, what the fuck, I had Simulator, but I had to play that once.
[102:13.13]I had to.
[102:13.59]Do you know how long I've had Hand Simulator 4 in my Steam inventory?
[102:20.01]Since 2016.
[102:20.39]I had to play it, and I'm not playing that by myself.
[102:32.40]You didn't have to at all.
[102:37.78]Nobody forced you to play it.
[102:39.02]I did.
[102:41.10]I forced myself to play it once.
[102:43.34]Because I needed to know.
[102:44.98]There's so much talk about how fucking fun it is and how funny and cool it is.
[102:49.82]I had to try it.
[102:51.16]And there was my one opportunity.
[102:53.04]The secret stream that's not a stream is the perfect opportunity for that.
[102:59.73]You think I'm going to use a real stream for that game?
[103:15.16]Let's go.
[103:15.38]Come on, come on, come on.
[103:16.02]More, more, more, more, more.
[103:16.94]Where are they?
[103:17.32]There's another full one here.
[103:29.30]What's the other co-op game?
[103:30.50]Uh, we're gonna try to play the game called Tools Up.
[103:34.94]Just came out today.
[103:37.54]It's local only, but we're gonna try to use that Steam Remote Play thing?
[103:49.72]We're going to test and see if that thing works.
[103:52.79]That's the plan.
[104:01.67]Okay, give me the thing.
[104:05.03]I want to use... Let's try this.
[104:11.77]Okay, that's pretty cool, but I feel like I'm wasting it.
[104:21.51]Anybody have any experience with the Steam remote play?
[104:24.55]Does it actually work?
[104:27.69]It works, but it could be a little weird.
[104:28.99]Oh, okay.
[104:30.39]How so?
[104:32.46]It's alright.
[104:37.01]Or would you get horrendous ping?
[104:39.41]Um, I don't think so, because it's gonna be me, Star, and then probably Talos.
[104:46.75]And Talos and I have the same deck.
[104:49.86]So I don't think it'll be an issue.
[105:04.41]A game called Tools Up.
[105:06.39]Okay, it's like Star was telling me earlier.
[105:09.61]And this is, I don't know, he's a salty bastard, isn't he?
[105:12.39]Look at how salty this is.
[105:14.91]He said it reminds him of Viscifer Cleanup Detail, but an actual video game.
[105:19.22]And I was like, God, that's salty.
[105:22.32]It's true.
[105:28.52]But that's not even, that's salty.
[105:34.35]I don't think I've ever met anybody that hated visceral cleanup detail.
[105:40.29]You know what I'm saying?
[105:41.05]Like, he hated it.
[105:42.71]He didn't like it.
[105:45.03]Is that even possible?
[105:46.96]Is it possible to not like visceral cleanup detail?
[105:52.32]I feel like that's saying Super Mario sucks.
[105:56.72]It's like, you can't, that's not true.
[105:58.56]Super Mario is cool.
[106:03.91]Like, you would never find yourself saying, I hope Super Mario gets hit by a bus.
[106:10.04]You would never find yourself saying that.
[106:12.10]Would you?
[106:18.21]What is this?
[106:26.65]Holy shit.
[106:29.39]It kills everything instantly on the screen?
[106:43.07]I love Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[106:44.63]It's like the best game.
[106:55.71]Oh shit.
[107:00.92]You know what?
[107:01.26]I wish every game was Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[107:04.38]In fact, I should just play Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[107:08.41]Like, the next week or something, because I like it so much.
[107:17.70]Why aren't I?
[107:18.54]I don't know.
[107:22.46]Because I played Hand Simulator instead.
[107:24.34]What do you mean, right now?
[107:32.61]No, not yet.
[107:33.71]Hold on, I'm playing a medieval!
[107:40.11]No, I can't play that right now, because I'll get stuck for like seven more hours.
[107:43.89]Do it now.
[107:49.41]What?
[107:49.69]Hold on, relax.
[108:03.37]I want to fight another boss.
[108:05.47]Oh man, guys.
[108:11.41]Okay, did I just show you all the Christmas presents in the closet?
[108:17.96]Like, I said, oh, hey, hey, hey, little Johnny, come here for a second.
[108:23.42]See, this is where your mom and dad and I, we keep your presents here.
[108:29.58]Oh, yeah.
[108:31.08]Oh, but look!
[108:31.92]And then close it real quick.
[108:32.94]So that might have been like a PS4 in there.
[108:35.14]That might have been like a Spongebob character.
[108:37.58]You might have glimpsed it, and then I close it.
[108:39.14]And I say, no, you can't go in there.
[108:43.40]Did I just do that?
[108:46.88]PS4 in 2019?
[108:48.52]Yeah, what a deal.
[108:50.06]It's like $116.
[108:50.36]I don't know.
[108:51.12]How much is a PS4 now?
[108:52.42]How much is a PS4 right now?
[108:53.40]Like $112?
[109:14.02]Had to.
[109:17.76]Pull or riot.
[109:18.64]Pull or riot.
[109:21.40]Guys, are we actually going to do the coveted three games in one stream?
[109:27.55]Is that going to happen?
[109:32.65]Just let me get to another boss.
[109:44.45]Yeah, I'm gonna fight the boss.
[109:48.85]Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[109:51.29]Am I really gonna switch to Viscera Cleanup Detail?
[109:57.17]It is a PS4, because you guys have already played the PS4.
[110:04.57]Somebody said LUL PS4 in 2019.
[110:06.66]I'm gonna play Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[110:08.56]That game came out like six years ago.
[110:11.43]So you are playing the PS4.
[110:12.83]You are getting the PS4 for Christmas.
[110:18.87]Oh no, another one of these.
[110:27.72]Didn't I already do that?
[110:29.26]I'm so confused right now.
[110:31.81]What happened?
[110:32.31]Where am I?
[110:32.67]Do I have the gold key?
[110:35.43]I have the gold key, right?
[110:36.41]I have no idea.
[110:41.61]Not playing Viscera is like chokeslamming us off of Hell in a Cell.
[110:44.98]What the fuck are you talking about?
[110:54.46]I need to focus.
[110:55.72]It was up here, right, okay.
[111:00.18]I will tell you though, I have...
[111:02.76]I have something coming that I'm gonna use.
[111:05.21]It might not be tomorrow or the next day.
[111:07.19]Maybe.
[111:08.29]I have a device that I cannot wait to play with on stream.
[111:14.47]It'll be here soon.
[111:15.38]I don't know exactly when you're gonna see it, but you'll see it as a device.
[111:21.02]And it is the coolest fucking device I think I've ever seen.
[111:24.72]If it works.
[111:25.67]I don't know if it's gonna work or not.
[111:36.89]Stone unhewn has no purpose.
[111:41.65]It's a mop.
[111:52.83]It's a mop.
[111:56.21]Jeez, you say the word device, and all of a sudden...
[112:01.73]I gotta get the bread and butter out here.
[112:04.11]No.
[112:04.45]Where is it?
[112:05.03]No.
[112:05.59]Actually, no.
[112:07.09]Actually, this... Yeah.
[112:20.94]I'm not even gonna... I'm gonna... It's gonna be a surprise.
[112:23.34]It's gonna appear.
[112:24.20]By the way, it's gonna be on cam.
[112:26.38]So...
[112:31.80]Boss!
[112:32.74]No.
[112:35.67]Shit, I'm taking a lot of damage.
[112:36.83]Back up.
[112:37.11]Do you have the remote control thing from Adam Sandler?
[112:48.68]No, I don't have the remote control thing from Adam Sandler.
[112:55.48]Everybody talks a lot of shit about Adam Sandler, and I know at least a thousand of you liked that movie.
[113:02.80]You were about to say, and then you squished your face and you got wicked red.
[113:12.89]Two more to go.
[113:13.51]I probably shouldn't be doing this.
[113:25.05]Perfection.
[113:27.01]You've never seen an Adam Sandler movie?
[113:28.69]How is that possible?
[113:33.34]He's made like 60.
[113:34.42]You've never accidentally just stumbled upon one just on TV one day?
[113:39.40]What did that do?
[113:46.62]What do you mean TV?
[113:53.51]Oh my goodness, this is bad.
[113:55.35]I might just... No fall damage, good.
[114:05.45]Oh, not good, not good, not good, not good, not good.
[114:07.79]He's gonna die for the second time only tonight in this game.
[114:10.54]Not everybody has a TV.
[114:17.02]Did you have a TV before?
[114:26.25]You coming down?
[114:26.81]Let's go.
[114:31.73]Come down.
[114:41.31]Did I just hit one person with that?
[114:45.17]Wait a minute.
[114:45.81]Wait a minute.
[114:46.45]How is that possum?
[115:04.65]Come on, chain it.
[115:09.35]I'm dead.
[115:12.23]Nah, just kill me.
[115:12.99]I've wasted too much health points.
[115:22.40]Give me the thing that I like to use.
[115:24.42]No.
[115:25.32]No.
[115:26.66]No.
[115:28.08]This.
[115:31.18]If you don't get hit, you don't die.
[115:36.42]What kind of concept is that?
[115:42.73]The dev said you stink.
[115:44.03]I have to drop you.
[115:54.28]Drop!
[115:57.38]Wait.
[115:59.44]This health.
[116:01.06]Alright.
[116:05.81]Drop!
[116:13.07]One at a time.
[116:24.72]No, no, no.
[116:32.12]Fucking one HP, man!
[116:34.18]One!
[116:43.21]Alright, where's those heals?
[116:50.32]No, I need... I need health.
[116:53.92]This can't work without health.
[117:01.25]Not playing Viscera is equal to you slamming my head into a glass table 32 times and doing my face as a bloody bruised pulp.
[117:07.41]Please, stop.
[117:16.01]Jesus Christ.
[117:20.11]How did I read that?
[117:21.02]I don't know.
[117:22.56]It was there.
[117:23.12]It was available.
[117:29.28]What map have I not done?
[117:30.98]Alright, can this please come down?
[117:35.93]I'm afraid to hit F5.
[117:37.05]What did I miss up here?
[117:48.26]You play games like I use the bathroom, very messily.
[117:55.14]Uh, that's like a dig on you, not me.
[118:03.86]Okay, there's health over here.
[118:05.25]That should be okay.
[118:12.65]Now press the button, which activated another thing.
[118:23.21]Projectiles are way better than mine.
[118:25.31]In fact, give me the sword.
[118:40.73]They're raining hell.
[118:44.03]Are we dead?
[118:51.84]I'm not sure if it's hitting me.
[118:52.66]Yeah, no, it's hitting.
[118:53.26]It's hitting.
[118:53.54]Somebody died.
[119:04.21]Hmm.
[119:09.79]Got it.
[119:10.03]Alright.
[119:11.47]Five.
[119:13.57]Let's jump and then jump.
[119:18.68]No, I can't.
[119:19.42]Hit this.
[119:22.20]Ah, I see.
[119:27.52]You love watching Jerma985 while balancing chemical equations.
[119:31.99]Good luck on your history.
[119:35.13]Homework.
[119:37.43]That you're going to do next.

[121:32.02]I'm not even sure I still have the game installed.
[121:33.74]Just give me a moment.
[121:35.58]We're going for the try stream.
[121:39.60]Well, the first game doesn't count.
[121:40.76]I agree.
[121:41.44]But... But who cares?
[121:50.51]I feel like I'm missing something.
[121:54.95]People are gonna laugh at me when I don't get 100%.
[121:56.57]Oh well.
