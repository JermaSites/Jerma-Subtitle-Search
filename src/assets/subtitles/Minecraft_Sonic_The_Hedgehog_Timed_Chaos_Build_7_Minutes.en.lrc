[00:08.95]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.61]Jerma here, and MLC Stealth.
[00:13.54]And today, on Timed Chaos Build, you can't start yet.
[00:17.80]I wasn't, I was hiding.
[00:18.88]Today we're going to be doing another Timed Chaos Build.
[00:22.47]We're going to be building Sonic the Hedgehog.
[00:25.65]Because we haven't done really any gaming-related things.
[00:29.43]I mean, the only thing we came close to was the Super Mario Cheetos freaking, like, Pringles man that we did with the first episode.
[00:37.16]So, we're going to end up doing an actual gaming, iconic gaming character, Sonic the Hedgehog.
[00:41.14]And we've got seven minutes to do it.
[00:43.38]So are you ready, Stealth?
[00:45.03]I am absolutely not ready because it's going to be bad.
[00:48.43]So let's see how this goes.
[00:49.97]We got seven minutes in three, two, one, go.
[00:53.95]So we're starting his feet?
[00:56.55]Yeah, I'll do the front leg.
[00:57.90]Let's try to not make him like as tall as Andre the Giant.
[01:01.70]That's probably a good idea.
[01:03.98]We always make their legs like 10, like 100 feet apart from each other.
[01:08.52]And then it's like, oh man, this guy's going to be huge.
[01:11.00]Alright.
[01:11.28]So wait, is Sonic the Hedgehog's whole shoes blue?
[01:13.98]I mean, blue, red?
[01:15.78]Jerma, this color is red.
[01:16.72]Okay.
[01:17.96]Yeah, that's fine.
[01:18.92]Here, make his feet a little bit longer.
[01:20.48]Like that long.
[01:22.27]okay well he's like running yes yeah no well yes wait no it's too that's too long no it's not it's fine he's good why are you going that way because he's gonna be like running no just go we don't have time what which way is he facing I don't know he's facing that way
[01:47.64]Okay.
[01:48.07]He's facing the other way.
[01:49.95]I don't know what you did with this sideways foot over here.
[01:56.10]He's plie-ing right now.
[01:57.64]That's like what he's doing.
[02:01.03]Great.
[02:02.13]No, because this leg's gonna... This is ballet Sonic the Hedgehog, apparently.
[02:09.37]Look, he really is playing.
[02:12.73]Alright, this has to be a little bit shorter.
[02:14.31]Like this.
[02:17.63]Alright, dang it.
[02:18.41]Almost one and a half minutes have gone by.
[02:21.82]Alright, so that's... We made two feet.
[02:23.46]That's fine.
[02:24.00]That's fine.
[02:27.88]Have him come up.
[02:28.58]We never give him any legs.
[02:30.26]We just make it go straight from, like, knee to freaking body.
[02:36.22]I gotta do the spikes.
[02:37.18]I'm gonna do the spikes.
[02:40.82]We don't have time.
[02:41.44]We gotta go.
[02:41.76]I can't even finish this.
[02:42.88]I don't even know what this is.
[02:44.48]Is he on his knees?
[02:45.52]Why is this leg, like, two inches long?
[02:49.88]Look at his left leg!
[02:50.84]He doesn't have one!
[02:52.47]I have no idea how to do the spikes on his back.
[02:55.81]I don't know!
[02:58.39]I have no idea how to do this!
[03:00.19]Look at how long his legs are!
[03:05.41]Screw it, straight to the head.
[03:06.39]The head is like the most iconic part of him, so I'm gonna make sure at least that's there.
[03:12.87]I'm like losing breath, man.
[03:15.25]Alright, here comes the spikes.
[03:19.47]Doesn't he have white in the spikes too?
[03:22.11]Sure.
[03:25.12]Head time.
[03:25.64]Yeah, you do the head.
[03:29.50]What color is his mouth?
[03:31.14]He's got a giant hand!
[03:32.56]It's a giant hand on legs!
[03:38.03]This is not Sonic the Hedgehog!
[03:42.17]Almost three minutes have gone by.
[03:43.15]I've tried to make it remotely Sonic the Hedgehog.
[03:45.29]How long do we have?
[03:46.33]We have like four minutes.
[03:48.01]Alright, he has white on his stomach, doesn't he?
[03:50.24]Uh, oh yeah yeah yeah.
[03:53.26]Kinda like a penguin?
[03:56.78]Oh, crap!
[03:58.06]You have the wrong thing!
[03:59.18]Hold on, I'm getting wool.
[04:03.17]Alright, I'm getting the spikes to come out of his head.
[04:04.71]Alright, it's starting to look like Space Bug Sonic the Hedgehog.
[04:15.89]Wait, his mouth is somewhat like that.
[04:24.78]Alright, arms.
[04:26.50]If you had to take a guess at what this was... Oh, you would never be able to guess this.
[04:32.29]He's supposed to be running.
[04:35.65]I still have no idea what the heck you did with his right leg.
[04:39.35]I thought we were going the other way.
[04:41.49]He kind of looks like the Mass Effect alien race.
[04:47.35]What's that Mass Effect-like alien girl?
[04:50.99]What is her name?
[04:51.63]She's the one in the space suit, I think?
[04:54.58]Nah, I'm not able to guess that.
[04:58.26]Alright.
[04:59.68]Oh, cool.
[05:00.16]Good thing we got Scorpion Sonic the Hedgehog.
[05:03.02]The actual bug Scorpion.
[05:05.95]Four minutes have gone by.
[05:07.79]That's his hand?!
[05:10.43]Yes.
[05:15.78]Alright, he's broken.
[05:16.68]He is completely broken.
[05:18.04]He's broken in so many different pieces.
[05:19.56]I don't even know how to fix this.
[05:22.44]Yeah, I don't know how to fix this.
[05:23.86]This is so broken.
[05:26.08]This is so screwed up.
[05:27.55]Look at how many directions his body is going in.
[05:30.15]You know what he looks like?
[05:31.09]He looks like... Okay, you took his head, you twisted it.
[05:33.41]You took his body, you twisted it.
[05:35.05]And you took his legs and you twisted it in completely different directions.
[05:38.13]And that's how you left him.
[05:40.49]Like, imagine he's on a, like, all, like, he has head, and his stomach, and his legs are on a 360 degree plane, and you spun him, in random directions.
[05:48.40]Alright, we got, we need more spikes.
[05:51.62]I don't, he doesn't have this many spikes.
[05:54.56]Well, it's alright.
[05:56.24]He looks, like a character, he, just, did he, okay, let's give him eyes, first off.
[06:02.02]Okay, give him the eyes, it'll look like normal with the eyes.
[06:03.94]Uh...
[06:10.79]And his hair has to have the hair come up like this.
[06:14.01]It looks normal with the eyes.
[06:15.65]That looks worse.
[06:17.89]5 minutes and 25 seconds.
[06:19.09]What kind of skin is this?
[06:21.33]If I was this Sonic the Hedgehog, this guy is in... I know we've said this before, but I would be in pain.
[06:28.58]I would be in so much pain as this character.
[06:33.86]There is no words to describe what we have created here.
[06:37.30]But it absolutely is not Sonic the Hedgehog.
[06:39.97]No.
[06:41.23]No, it's not.
[06:43.75]Sounds like it's going great.
[06:46.33]He's E.T.
[06:53.82]We still have a full minute, and I don't even know where to go.
[06:58.48]There's no fixing this.
[07:00.02]Oh, check it out.
[07:00.58]It's E.T.
[07:01.75]with giant... Oh, I don't know.
[07:03.43]Alright, come over here.
[07:04.87]Let's at least fix this.
[07:05.99]Like you said, he doesn't have these spikes coming out all over the place.
[07:09.97]You know what he is?
[07:10.83]He's a maze.
[07:13.10]He's a standing up maze.
[07:17.14]I always make the hands the same way.
[07:19.10]I give him like four fingers, and they look like pitchforks.
[07:22.10]Every single time.
[07:23.53]It's gonna be more like glove-based.
[07:29.15]Oh, that did it!
[07:29.71]That fixed it, Jerma!
[07:30.49]Good job!
[07:31.19]I just made it ten times worse!
[07:32.63]There you go!
[07:35.64]Alright, let's just make him have, like, a giant tongue coming out.
[07:40.57]Yeah!
[07:41.37]Alright, well, we have ten.
[07:42.55]It's one of those plush toys that you get, like, mad at, and you, like, squeeze it, and everything just pops out.
[07:47.13]He does!
[07:47.43]He really looks like a squeeze.
[07:48.27]He looks like one of those squeeze toys.
[07:49.27]Alright, well, we only have three seconds.
[07:51.39]Three, two, one.
[07:54.34]And, let's, uh, let's set the time.
[07:56.44]Oh, no, wrong thing.
[07:57.74]Dude, this could be the first time we, like, even tried it.
[08:01.57]Oh, man.
[08:02.50]There he is.
[08:02.92]There is Sonic the Hedgehog.
[08:10.40]Alright, so if you want to give it a different name, by all means go ahead.
[08:14.76]But let us know how we did.
[08:17.81]What this guy has to Sonic is that they're both blue.
[08:20.55]That is literally it.
[08:21.63]That's it.
[08:23.21]That's the only similarity.
[08:24.37]Alright guys, well, thank you so much for watching.
[08:27.95]I really do appreciate it.
[08:28.81]My goodness.
[08:30.76]My goodness.
[08:31.76]How did this happen?
[08:32.78]How did this... How did this happen?
[08:37.90]His legs are seriously just like two inches long.
[08:40.35]He doesn't even have legs.
[08:42.75]It went from his feet to his body.
[08:45.89]Oh, well.
[08:47.13]See you guys all next time.
[08:48.24]And, of course, take care, everybody.
[08:49.68]Thanks for watching.
[08:52.80]Oh, my God.
[08:53.46]This is insane.
