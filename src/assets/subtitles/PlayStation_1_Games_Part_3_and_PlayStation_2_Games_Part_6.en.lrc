[01:30.92]God damn it.
[01:31.80]I... Really?
[01:33.22]Why was that turned on?
[01:34.50]I've been talking for two... Okay.
[01:36.70]I was like, why is nobody sympathizing with me right now?
[01:40.20]Okay, so listen.
[01:41.76]Wow, I've been talking for like five straight minutes.
[01:43.88]Like, I've been talking for three straight minutes.
[01:47.72]Uh, anyways.
[01:48.61]I made a little bit of an oopsie.
[01:51.07]Uh... I, um...
[01:54.87]I kind of was moving a table around because I had to put a table in this room and I sort of maybe may have fell down and the table like punched me right in the chest and throat.
[02:09.13]And it's actually kind of funny because I just told this story and I looked over in chat and I saw somebody say LIAR in all capitals.
[02:17.12]So I thought I was unmuted.
[02:18.86]So I was like, no, no, no, no, no, excuse me, buddy.
[02:21.12]I was talking to somebody in chat.
[02:23.27]Somebody said LIAR right after I said this whole story two minutes ago.
[02:27.83]So I just went off on a rant about that guy.
[02:30.99]And here's what I was about to say.
[02:34.34]If I was lying, if it was like, oh, I fell down.
[02:37.10]Oh, I smashed my chest.
[02:39.20]It would be 2.40 when I start the stream.
[02:41.44]It would be an excuse.
[02:42.56]I'm five minutes early.
[02:43.92]That's how you know it's not bullshit.
[02:46.48]Think about that.
[02:48.04]It would be like, oh, 2.45 and I'm just getting started.
[02:52.00]I fell down.
[02:52.64]That's why I'm late.
[02:53.52]I'm five minutes early.
[02:57.08]But anyways, yeah, that sucked.
[03:00.69]It like hit me right in the fucking collarbone.
[03:03.09]It was bad.
[03:05.01]But I'm a little sore.
[03:06.17]I'm alright.
[03:06.67]Don't worry.
[03:07.45]We've got quite a day today.
[03:11.30]Oh, I hope you're... Give me sympathy.
[03:14.20]Give me sympathy.
[03:14.86]Are you okay?
[03:16.48]Yes, I'm okay.
[03:17.60]Thank you.
[03:25.01]Anyways.
[03:27.01]I'm looking over here and I'm just getting... You know what?
[03:29.17]We're going back.
[03:30.87]to we're going back to 2017 streamer Andy those of you that remember that have been around for a while I've got a stack of PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games there are about 27 of them and I may have gone a little overboard I'm going to give you a spoiler I'm going to just tell you what one or two of them are of course we're starting with driver
[04:01.34]Driver 1 for the PlayStation 1.
[04:04.34]Right after that, I'm just going to give you just what's coming up next.
[04:07.83]I'm not going to tell you anything else.
[04:10.23]We have the Land Before Time racing adventure.
[04:14.55]I feel like a lot of you are going to be really, really happy about that one.
[04:20.57]So that's the first two.
[04:22.71]I'm not going to tell you what the other ones are.
[04:27.42]Boomer game seems lame.
[04:29.72]Ban that person for an hour.
[04:36.17]You better fucking have Crash Team Racing.
[04:38.07]I don't sell stuff here.
[04:44.25]No, I don't.
[04:46.15]No, I do have... No, no spoilers.
[04:48.65]Why would I spoil it?
[04:49.59]I'm going to show it to you.
[04:50.44]You know what?
[04:50.84]Fine.
[04:51.08]Here's your last spoiler.
[04:52.76]There are like 30 plus games here.
[04:54.60]I'm going to tell you one of them.
[04:56.60]And you need to trust me on this one.
[04:58.90]Because people go like, oh, well, he doesn't have Crash Team Racing.
[05:02.34]What a fucking idiot.
[05:03.97]Am I?
[05:04.77]Because I got the Bionicle PS2 game.
[05:07.01]You sitting down now?
[05:07.75]Are you going to be quiet now?
[05:08.83]Are you going to quiet down now?
[05:11.71]Okay.
[05:16.16]Are you going to quiet down now?
[05:20.02]Well, I mean, get excited about that, but quiet down after that.
[05:25.90]He knows his audience.
[05:27.85]Alright, you guys ready?
[05:28.61]I'm about to... Driver 1 is already ready to go.
[05:31.45]It's already here.
[05:35.95]Fucking chest hurts.
[05:38.15]Holy shit, Bionicle PS2 game.
[05:41.44]I might not be able to watch the Bionicle movie, but we can play the Bionicle game and pretend we're watching the movie.
[05:46.68]Is that okay with you guys?
[05:49.06]You guys ready?
[05:49.42]Are you guys ready?
[05:54.76]We need to do something very first and foremost.
[05:56.74]I want to make sure, because capturing old... Because this is original hardware, by the way.
[06:00.34]This is original hardware.
[06:02.12]Capturing old consoles... Um...
[06:07.15]It's kind of hard.
[06:08.17]So we need to do a test.
[06:09.83]I know it's desynced.
[06:10.59]We're going to do a test.
[06:12.55]How badly desynced am I?
[06:15.38]If I go like this, go, go, go, go, go.
[06:19.96]How is that?
[06:23.98]Your voice is desynced.
[06:24.84]Okay, hold on.
[06:27.26]Let's go for that.
[06:30.40]It should be lined up.
[06:32.47]How about this?
[06:41.97]OK, so that you tell me that's not lined up.
[06:46.91]Are you hearing me first or is my mouth moving and then you're hearing me or are you hearing me and then my mouth moving?
[06:52.93]Which one?
[06:58.27]We hear you first.
[07:00.85]OK.
[07:04.21]How's this?
[07:06.29]How is that?
[07:07.99]Is that any better?
[07:11.17]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[07:13.35]Is it better?
[07:17.21]Still bad.
[07:17.95]It's worse.
[07:18.63]How does that make any sense?
[07:20.79]You hear me first?
[07:23.84]What?
[07:25.84]That's impossible.
[07:27.88]Okay, hold on.
[07:35.04]Hello.
[07:36.20]My name is Jerma.
[07:37.31]It's really good to see you.
[07:38.93]How are you doing today?
[07:44.08]Now it's like two seconds.
[07:45.21]Wait, people are saying better.
[07:46.25]People are saying closer.
[07:47.17]Still bad.
[07:47.69]Okay, hold on.
[07:49.18]Okay, hold on.
[07:49.70]Better, but still delayed.
[07:51.93]This is very confusing.
[07:53.99]Because here's how this works.
[07:55.19]For those of you that, you know, those of you that, you know, don't know that much about tech like I do.
[07:59.19]So I, because I'm capturing this console through a capture card, the actual video is delayed.
[08:06.78]Like the video, the actual video game is delayed by about one full second.
[08:11.64]So what I have to do is I have to delay my webcam and delay my voice by the same amount of time that the video is delayed.
[08:20.39]And I thought I had it correct, but apparently not, because they should match up perfectly.
[08:25.65]So, give me a second.
[08:27.43]That's weird.
[08:28.33]So, why is that happening?
[08:30.21]We do this now so I don't have a meltdown in the middle of Driver 1.
[08:33.71]You know what I'm saying?
[08:36.21]This should not be happening.
[08:38.19]So, is it still... Okay, so are you still... Are you hearing me first still?
[08:41.75]What if I do this?
[08:43.85]Hi, everybody.
[08:44.59]It's me, Jermo.
[08:45.65]How's everybody doing?
[08:46.37]You doing good?
[08:48.62]What's happening?
[08:49.20]How are you?
[08:53.39]But here's the problem.
[08:54.21]This is why this is going to get weird.
[08:55.57]Because watch this.
[08:56.53]One.
[08:58.59]That's off.
[09:00.22]One, two, three.
[09:02.08]Now that's delayed.
[09:10.38]What?
[09:12.19]It's two or three seconds off.
[09:15.05]Voices.
[09:15.65]What is it?
[09:16.05]I've never had this problem before.
[09:19.13]I'm delaying the video by 500 milliseconds.
[09:26.50]And I'm delaying the audio by 500 milliseconds.
[09:29.22]So what's happening here?
[09:32.58]I'm very confused.
[09:34.74]Is this?
[09:35.34]How is this?
[09:35.74]Hold on.
[09:39.66]Why is this so fucked up?
[09:42.26]OK, so now I'm delaying it again and now it should.
[09:44.94]Here we go.
[09:46.48]1, 2, 3, 4.
[09:48.48]It should be synced.
[09:55.51]No.
[09:57.96]Alright, this is the only time this has ever happened.
[10:01.02]So I'm delaying my audio by 500 milliseconds.
[10:04.46]And I'm delaying my video by 500 milliseconds.
[10:06.76]Why are they not matched up?
[10:09.74]That doesn't make any sense.
[10:12.13]I'm delaying the audio by 500 and I'm delaying the video by 500.
[10:15.75]What's going on?
[10:17.77]What the fuck's happening?
[10:21.45]The video is slower.
[10:25.68]Why the fuck is that happening?
[10:27.03]Hold on.
[10:27.67]I think I know why.
[10:28.87]All webcams are trash.
[10:30.05]That's why.
[10:30.39]Hold on.
[10:35.93]All webcams are garbage.
[10:37.61]Don't believe any of the lies.
[10:38.70]Hold on.
[10:41.32]The webcam is slower.
[10:42.88]I don't get it.
[10:43.62]Hold on a second.
[10:47.94]He's reading off of a script.
[10:49.82]Alright, what if I do this?
[10:57.25]Is that better?
[10:57.59]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[10:59.79]No.
[11:00.11]What the hell is going on?
[11:12.47]Alright, so let me delay.
[11:13.63]We're getting these bugs out of the way first.
[11:18.01]Because I cannot tell you why this is happening.
[11:20.64]Every time you've ever seen a console game, I've done it like this and it's been fine.
[11:24.92]So, what about this?
[11:28.67]Hi!
[11:30.15]How are you?
[11:33.23]Just delay the audio to match the cam.
[11:34.81]That's what I did.
[11:35.25]They were both at 500.
[11:36.23]How is it worse?
[11:42.68]The webcam is still too late.
[11:46.04]I've done it like this literally every single time I've ever delayed the webcam.
[11:50.08]I don't get it.
[11:50.82]What happened?
[11:51.26]What changed?
[11:51.66]I guess the PS1?
[11:56.67]Worst bit.
[11:57.35]This is not a bit.
[11:58.13]I swear to God.
[11:59.05]It doesn't make any fucking sense.
[12:01.81]How is it getting worse?
[12:02.70]I don't know, because technology is stupid.
[12:06.06]My webcam is delayed by 500 milliseconds.
[12:08.34]My audio is delayed by 500 milliseconds.
[12:10.48]Where are the scientists to explain to me what's going on?
[12:12.40]Delay the audio by longer.
[12:21.07]It's going to fuck up how I capture it.
[12:22.47]Hold on.
[12:23.85]This is a mess.
[12:25.15]Is that right?
[12:29.19]Let's try this.
[12:31.35]Why would that make any s- So I'm delaying my audio by 750 and I'm delaying the camera by 500.
[12:39.13]Excuse me?
[12:40.07]What's going on here?
[12:44.16]Hello?
[12:44.38]Hi.
[12:47.62]How does that make- How does that make any fucking sense?
[12:49.98]How does that make any sense?
[12:53.44]I need an audio engineer.
[12:54.46]How does that make any sense?
[12:58.58]Better?
[12:58.82]Alright, but what about this though?
[13:01.36]One.
[13:03.20]Two.
[13:05.04]One, two, one.
[13:07.06]I gotta match the video.
[13:10.96]The latency difference is m'lady.
[13:15.32]Delay the audio by a little bit more?
[13:18.10]Why?
[13:18.74]What the fuck?
[13:19.46]Thousand times I've never had to do this before.
[13:23.74]One, two, one, two, one, two, one.
[13:27.11]Hi.
[13:27.83]Hello there.
[13:28.45]My name is Jerma985.
[13:29.87]I am ready to stream.
[13:32.97]We're getting rid of the technical problems before we start.
[13:36.36]Am I lip-syncing correctly?
[13:45.20]Yeah?
[13:48.18]Good enough?
[13:48.82]Close enough.
[13:49.78]I don't understand this.
[13:51.00]Alright, let's go.
[13:52.04]Are you ready?
[13:53.19]I'm closing the lid.
[13:53.95]That means we gotta go.
[13:58.78]It's serviceable.
[14:01.72]The camera is like 50 mil.
[14:03.08]Wait, hold on.
[14:03.52]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:04.10]I got to get this right.
[14:04.78]I got like, I'm going to be here all night.
[14:08.94]Like this?
[14:10.28]How's that?
[14:11.48]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:12.88]My name is Jerma985.
[14:15.10]I'm here to stream some PlayStation 1 video games.
[14:21.71]And I am here to describe to you what it feels like to have this controller in my hand.
[14:32.12]Still bad?
[14:33.80]It's not good enough.
[14:37.88]You overcorrected?
[14:38.98]What the fuck?
[14:41.41]I've never had this experience before.
[14:45.27]No, it's food.
[14:46.71]Audio is now delayed.
[14:48.11]Wait, hold on.
[14:49.07]Let's see if we can get the Goldilocks here.
[14:51.61]The stream hasn't even started yet.
[14:57.12]Welcome, everyone, to a live stream on twitch.tv.
[15:01.42]I'm Jerma985.
[15:02.52]Hi, everybody.
[15:17.22]Welcome.
[15:17.80]My name is Jerma985.
[15:19.72]It's a very beautiful day out today.
[15:21.22]It's a sunny, shining day.
[15:27.51]Good.
[15:28.09]It's so close.
[15:30.21]Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
[15:31.53]Okay, wait.
[15:32.31]One.
[15:33.97]Two.
[15:35.67]One, two.
[15:37.25]Is that synced?
[15:41.19]Are we good?
[15:43.53]Good.
[15:44.63]Absolutely perfect.
[15:45.43]Stop overpronouncing words.
[15:49.37]Alright.
[15:51.33]Don't touch anything.
[15:51.97]The video might be delayed slightly.
[15:57.57]Don't tell me that.
[15:58.31]Make it.
[15:58.95]Okay.
[16:00.05]We've been in a nightmare for 10 minutes.
[16:02.02]People just showed up.
[16:03.56]Look, I don't have an intro screen.
[16:05.06]You just watched it.
[16:05.86]It's 17 minutes.
[16:09.24]It's slightly off.
[16:11.04]Don't tell him it's slightly off.
[16:12.87]Do head movements to match.
[16:15.03]Down.
[16:15.97]Up.
[16:16.71]Down.
[16:18.73]Up.
[16:19.05]Down.
[16:19.31]Are we good?
[16:29.69]What'd you say?
[16:30.99]Get a movie clapper.
[16:36.71]Good?
[16:42.81]It's actually perfect.
[16:43.67]Play the game.
[16:44.29]Okay.
[16:44.55]Alright.
[16:44.83]Alright.
[16:45.11]Alright.
[16:45.47]Welcome, everybody, to a PlayStation 1 game.
[16:50.48]Let's close the lid.
[16:51.50]I'm ready.
[16:51.88]Are you ready?
[16:53.20]Welcome to PlayStation 1 Grab Bag Night.
[17:01.10]We're starting with driver one.
[17:02.24]There's somebody on Twitter that has been asking me to play this for, I believe it's been three straight years.
[17:17.57]Just to let that person know I'm here doing it.
[17:21.99]So you're probably going to have to, you're probably going to have to stop doing that Twitter.
[17:28.69]Why are you so sweaty already?
[17:33.22]Alright, this is GT Interactive Software presents... This is Driver 1!
[17:36.76]This is a very important one.
[17:44.91]Is it gonna be too loud?
[17:47.89]I got memory cards.
[17:48.63]I was prepared for this, except for the fact that I had to change my... whatever.
[18:14.74]Don't turn your head that many times.
[18:17.76]What are you looking for?
[18:18.94]That was just to prove that this was a 3D game.
[18:47.04]Am I stealing this car?
[19:01.61]Is this my car?
[19:02.65]I forgot your parking space.
[19:29.39]I just imagine the person that ran that Twitter is sprinting into this room.
[19:34.52]It's just like, oh mom, not ready.
[19:36.14]I didn't know he was even doing this today.
[19:39.36]Why is it so loud?
[19:57.52]What?
[20:08.71]Though he was stealing it.
[20:17.86]Who is that?
[20:30.36]Have we been just driving around in a circle the whole time?
[20:36.92]Driver, you are the wheel man.
[20:43.75]It's so going back to these old games and seeing these old cut scenes.
[20:49.85]It's crazy what's been able to happen here.
[20:53.71]That reminded me of an old GTA machinima, right?
[20:59.13]Turn the graphics up.
[21:02.87]Audio is behind.
[21:04.95]The game audio is behind now?
[21:06.33]Don't even get me started on that.
[21:08.17]Alright, so what do I do?
[21:11.99]It's not.
[21:16.65]No, it's fine, it's fine.
[21:17.47]No, no, no, no, it's fine.
[21:18.55]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[21:19.83]Stop it, one guy.
[21:20.74]Okay.
[21:22.36]So what do I want to do?
[21:24.32]Undercover?
[21:24.98]Car chases?
[21:25.80]Training?
[21:26.80]Cheats?
[21:27.10]What do I do?
[21:31.22]Training, right?
[21:36.37]car park.
[21:39.34]Okay.
[21:41.44]So this is the tutorial.
[21:42.56]Somebody said I would not finish this.
[21:44.24]They said you're never going to finish the tutorial.
[21:47.18]I think it was like a guarantee you won't beat the first level in Lord of the Rings, right?
[22:00.99]What is it trying to show me?
[22:03.61]Demonstration.
[22:12.44]Oh, I have to do all those things.
[22:14.00]Okay.
[22:19.31]Will you beat the tutorial in 30 minutes?
[22:23.13]What?
[22:29.50]You will not beat this.
[22:37.89]Do a lap?
[22:41.37]It's no, it's not analog.
[22:45.81]What?
[22:46.63]Oh, it's not.
[22:47.19]OK, it's not an analog game, right?
[22:48.95]Alright, let's go.
[22:57.65]Show us what you got.
[22:58.35]You crazy?
[23:15.51]I did a burnout.
[23:18.05]So what's handbrake?
[23:21.45]All this way this is revert go away.
[23:22.63]I gotta go fast.
[23:25.56]What's great?
[23:29.28]OK, handbrake is what?
[23:32.48]I think it's L1.
[23:36.34]Ooh, I got it. 360
[23:45.10]Oh, you can only do it four times before it's over.
[23:47.92]Alright, hold on.
[24:03.45]Okay, here we go.
[24:04.63]Let's break.
[24:09.63]Okay, give me the controls.
[24:11.95]Whoa, I just did it.
[24:14.94]Okay, hold on.
[24:15.52]Reverse 180.
[24:19.71]So, like... How is that not a reverse 180?
[24:27.75]Reverse 180.
[24:34.10]It's way... You're doing way... Go faster.
[24:39.08]Who the fuck is this other person up here?
[24:41.00]They're annoying me.
[24:43.52]I'm turning too slow?
[24:44.62]Alright, what's handbrake, L1?
[25:02.97]Wait, this is timed?
[25:08.13]It's on a timer?
[25:13.88]No, it's not.
[25:17.41]Maybe I'll give you a call when I need a ride to the grocery store.
[25:23.23]Maybe I'll give you a call if I need a ride to the grocery store.
[25:27.84]Oh, okay.
[25:30.24]I don't even understand it.
[25:31.44]Can I skip this?
[25:37.01]Okay, I have an idea.
[25:45.53]This is impossible.
[26:18.51]What do I even... Lap?
[26:19.97]What do you mean do a lap?
[26:25.33]Watch the tutorial again.
[26:28.24]Okay, hold on.
[26:30.22]I thought it was just showing me the buttons.
[26:33.22]Let me watch it again.
[26:35.04]Do I even need to beat the tutorial?
[26:39.32]Okay, let's watch it.
[26:40.00]Let me try.
[26:47.05]Read the instructions.
[26:47.81]There are no instructions.
[26:51.13]It's just like a hand cam of a streamer that's way better than me.
[27:04.86]You didn't even get... He's not even unlocking anything.
[27:08.11]What?
[27:21.69]OK, here comes the reverse.
[27:27.25]I did that.
[27:28.39]What about speed?
[27:36.59]How fast can you go here?
[27:37.59]OK, so he drives straight into the wall and then lap is imagining just a lap around the whole thing.
[27:50.00]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[27:51.22]I get it, I get it, I get it.
[27:52.02]Let's go, let's go.
[27:52.74]Ready?
[27:53.28]3, 2, 1, go.
[27:56.70]I'll get the speed first.
[27:57.60]Yeah!
[28:04.73]Bop.
[28:08.63]Bop.
[28:18.97]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:30.80]What the fuck?
[28:31.58]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, turn around.
[28:41.91]That's not it?
[28:42.47]I have to weave through these, right?
[29:03.91]Why is it not doing the 180?
[29:04.87]No, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[29:12.95]I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[29:15.25]I get it.
[29:16.64]I'll get it, I'll get it.
[29:17.18]Don't worry, I got it.
[29:18.76]I got it.
[29:22.88]Speed first.
[29:23.42]Okay, now we're gonna do reverse.
[29:28.87]How is that too slow?
[29:46.22]How is it too slow?
[29:47.08]You're turning too early.
[29:56.77]I don't understand.
[30:00.78]Just tap the handbrake.
[30:09.64]Handbrake, handbrake.
[30:11.98]Dude, this... I don't... Why can I not do a 180?
[30:34.92]you I got it I got it I got it I got it use the steering wheel I'm doing I'm using this
[31:02.16]Follow the ghost car?
[31:03.08]I thought you said that was my ghost car.
[31:04.68]Why would I follow this shitty ghost car that's not me?
[31:09.49]Wait, that's not me.
[31:12.33]Oh, I thought that was me.
[31:14.71]Like Mario Kart style.
[31:15.87]Alright, come on, come on, come on.
[31:46.00]I don't get the reverse 180.
[31:47.66]I can't do it.
[31:59.67]I don't understand.
[32:00.65]I can't get it to work.
[32:13.03]How is that not a reverse 180?
[32:20.24]I'm only doing this for five minutes.
[32:21.72]This is why everybody wanted me to play it.
[32:23.32]Oh, hey, play Driver 1.
[32:24.28]Don't tell them.
[32:26.26]Yeah, because this tutorial is stupid.
[32:29.89]Yeah, I remember reading the reviews on this.
[32:37.05]Yeah, like, I don't understand.
[32:37.99]Like, I just can't beat the tutorial.
[32:39.59]Like, I don't know.
[32:40.11]What were they thinking?
[32:41.18]What were they thinking?
[32:42.22]You know what I mean?
[32:43.30]That's where I am right now.
[32:45.66]You crazy?
[32:54.16]I give up.
[32:54.42]I don't even care.
[32:54.83]I'm just gonna play the game.
[32:57.27]I think I'm just playing the game.
[33:02.95]You can't bail on the tutorial, game journalist.
[33:05.68]Don't.
[33:11.63]I'll get it right now.
[33:12.77]Five more minutes.
[34:04.73]How is that not a reverse 180?
[34:06.38]That's exactly what I just did!
[34:16.05]This game sucks.
[34:19.56]I'm done.
[34:20.22]I'm not playing it anymore.
[34:45.38]It handles like a wet sock.
[35:07.25]He was waiting for me to play this.
[35:09.13]You guys were all just like, I can't wait.
[35:10.89]Here we go.
[35:11.59]Guaranteed fucking meltdown stream.
[35:13.83]No, it's not.
[35:18.86]I'll give you a fucking meltdown right here.
[35:49.53]Get out of here!
[35:50.21]What do you got?
[35:53.82]Come on!
[35:54.48]Come on!
[35:56.78]Not gonna lose the tutorial and driver?
[35:58.36]Uh-uh.
[35:59.34]That took me about even 30 minutes.
[36:01.12]How long did it take?
[36:02.14]How long did it take?
[36:12.10]That was less than 30 minutes.
[36:15.50]Who do you think you are?
[36:17.04]Who do you think you are?
[36:18.18]I am!
[36:18.56]Alright, I did it.
[36:27.30]Alright, let's play Driver 1.
[36:33.06]Alright, so we got Undercover.
[36:36.52]New game.
[36:38.06]Let's go.
[36:41.52]Truth is, Tanner, three years on the department and you're still the best driver I got.
[36:46.26]We don't get too many ex-racing boys in here.
[36:50.48]Lowlife Rumble in Miami is just a hunt on for a guy who can pump the gas.
[36:54.70]Big getaway, big job.
[36:57.18]Maybe even some kind of hit.
[36:59.22]Some hood by the name of Rufus is in the picture.
[37:02.20]We need a line on it.
[37:04.24]Coffee?
[37:05.24]Yeah.
[37:05.90]Black, right?
[37:09.57]Guys upstairs were asking for you in person.
[37:12.80]Look, we need you to go under, but no one's going to know except me.
[37:17.76]If I bring anyone else in.
[37:19.52]Very wanted, by the way.
[37:23.02]Why do they need your badge?
[37:25.38]Any questions?
[37:31.67]Wait, I'm a police officer undercover.
[37:41.94]Remember, this game is old.
[37:44.16]Yeah.
[37:45.51]What is this?
[37:48.73]I just did this.
[37:51.47]I just did this.
[37:52.15]Why do I have to do this?
[37:53.63]I just did it.
[38:01.98]Why do I have to do this again?
[38:15.73]What the fuck?
[38:16.88]No, I don't have to do this again, do I?
[38:40.23]That was the training, that was not the tutorial.
[38:43.11]Okay.
[38:46.00]Why did you let me do that?
[38:47.75]Why weren't you guys screaming at the top of your lungs for me not to do training to get right into the new game?
[39:05.49]Shit!
[39:20.51]Why am I doing this?
[39:21.69]I should have already did it.
[39:25.57]Why weren't you screaming at me?
[39:30.43]We're gonna do lap first.
[39:48.10]Give me that fucking 180.
[39:52.56]I didn't... Okay, the slalom.
[39:53.92]Slalom.
[39:54.42]Oh, fuck.
[39:57.40]No, you have to start with that.
[39:59.21]You have to start with slalom.
[40:07.85]Dude, you have to start with that.
[40:08.82]There's no way.
[40:09.74]Okay.
[40:22.29]You have to start with that.
[40:23.15]It's literally impossible if you don't.
[40:26.75]I can't believe I'm doing this twice.
[40:28.27]I cannot fucking believe it.
[40:30.21]I can't believe it.
[40:31.59]I forget how to start.
[40:32.83]I forget where you start it.
[40:33.83]You go like this way, right?
[40:53.94]Do I start left or right?
[40:55.20]I already did it.
[40:58.38]I don't remember where to start.
[40:59.74]Because you have to do the slalom fucking perfectly or it doesn't register.
[41:04.69]Oh my god, I hate this game.
[41:26.37]How the fuck does that not count already?
[41:29.79]And how is that not a 180?
[41:33.37]What fucking crack is this game smoking?
[41:35.83]How did I not just do the... This stupid troll had to give me an empty parking garage.
[41:53.14]Alright, let's go.
[42:06.82]Fuck off with this!
[42:27.40]Turn faster.
[42:28.14]Guys, it's a PlayStation 1 game.
[42:33.25]There's no pressure-sensitive turning.
[42:35.59]It's either held right or don't at all.
[42:38.85]There's no such thing as, oh, just do a little split.
[42:52.48]How is that not a fucking 180?
[42:57.19]I'm doing a reverse 180.
[42:59.41]What are you speaking of?
[43:03.19]What are you speaking of?
[43:04.84]How is that not a reverse 180?
[43:06.00]What are you speaking of?
[43:26.80]Hey, man.
[43:27.87]Watch this.
[43:29.70]Hey, man.
[43:49.11]And we got a job only you can handle.
[43:51.69]We need you to go undercover.
[43:53.53]And go find those criminals.
[43:55.19]And by the way, can you slalom around these ten times while I watch?
[43:59.62]Oh, fuck you, buddy.
[44:39.97]How do I burn out?
[44:45.01]How do I burn out?
[44:45.44]How do I burn out?
[44:45.92]How do I burn out?
[44:47.36]How do I burn out?
[44:48.08]Tell me.
[44:48.58]Somebody tell me quick.
[44:50.36]How do I burn out quick?
[44:51.40]How do I burn out?
[44:52.26]Circle?
[44:52.62]Oh my.
[45:09.21]You're a whiny baby.
[45:10.65]It's a specific button to burn out.
[45:16.88]You tell me there's a burnout button on this fucking computer video game.
[45:21.81]It's circle is burnout.
[45:24.57]It's not handbrake and gas, right?
[45:27.09]It's not break and get, right?
[45:28.51]Like, okay, okay.
[45:30.23]It's a button.
[45:46.83]Hey, man!
[45:47.17]Watch the plane!
[46:21.00]Oh, I got it.
[46:32.23]Fuckin' easy.
[46:38.04]Wait, save the game.
[46:40.04]I'm not doing that ever again.
[46:51.72]I don't care, just E. Did I do it?
[47:03.43]Alright, thank God.
[47:06.55]Okay, wait.
[47:08.42]Oh, there it is.
[47:08.86]Okay, good.
[47:09.32]Good, good, good.
[47:09.86]Very good, very good.
[47:10.50]Alright, we're good.
[47:14.74]It's been 45 minutes.
[47:16.40]Well, technically it didn't start and it's been about 25 minutes.
[47:19.80]We're good, we're ready.
[47:29.08]Why is it a different menu?
[47:34.10]Options?
[47:36.40]Get a new job.
[47:40.66]Why am I crawling around on the floor?
[47:42.53]Okay, new job.
[47:49.97]You have one new message.
[47:54.51]Okay.
[47:54.81]It's on.
[47:57.32]So listen.
[47:59.48]Um, do I have to call him back?
[48:10.54]Oh, okay.
[48:12.24]Let's go.
[48:24.41]It's Charlie and Frank's apartment from Always Sunny.
[48:29.01]Is it bright?
[48:34.04]Felony?
[48:35.42]Wait, why do I have one?
[48:37.00]We have one minute to rob a bank?
[48:41.90]Why are we doing this in the amount of time it takes to watch a YouTube short?
[48:45.18]What are we talking about?
[48:46.66]Where is it?
[48:48.66]One minute?
[48:56.18]Wait, up here?
[49:02.75]Is this a bank?
[49:04.63]That's not a bank.
[49:05.73]What is the bank over here?
[49:12.11]Where is this bank?
[49:22.96]Bro, this is somebody's house.
[49:23.96]There's like a big thing over here on the mini map.
[49:29.61]Is it that way?
[49:49.19]Is it right there?
[49:49.75]It's right there.
[49:55.01]Yeah!
[50:14.49]What?!
[50:14.93]It's right... right here!
[50:16.57]What are you talking about?
[50:17.99]What?! !
[50:19.88]Nice Target t-shirt.
[50:21.72]Whatever.
[50:24.16]Wait.
[50:24.60]Oh, you can... Oh.
[50:26.36]Go.
[50:46.45]I don't even know what the mini-map was trying to tell me before.
[50:48.93]This is it.
[50:49.45]We're good.
[50:49.71]We're good.
[50:50.07]I got it.
[50:59.84]Fuck.
[51:04.78]I thought there was a side street I could cut through.
[51:08.64]I did the same exact thing.
[51:10.97]Move your fat head I can't see.
[51:35.13]Oh my god, get out of the fucking way.
[51:43.83]How did I drive?
[51:44.83]Directly in... I was trying so desperately to avoid that pole.
[51:49.14]And I drove directly into it, square.
[51:51.48]Exactly, directly dead center of the car.
[51:54.78]I was so obsessed with trying to avoid that.
[51:56.88]That's why I did what I just did.
[51:59.84]Excuse me.
[52:26.42]Please don't blow up.
[52:29.62]Alright, I got it.
[52:30.42]I'm right here.
[52:34.20]Too early?
[52:35.14]What do you mean it's too early?
[52:44.84]What?
[52:52.79]Why are we picking up a Star Trek crew?
[52:56.47]Why did Captain Kirk just come out?
[52:58.67]What was that?
[52:59.25]Where are we going?
[53:02.60]Where do we go?
[53:29.00]What the fuck?
[53:32.02]Dude, okay.
[53:35.56]Why is time going up?
[53:37.28]Wait, am I gaining time or losing time?
[53:40.14]I'm so confused.
[53:43.58]What?
[53:48.16]Am I gaining time or was I lo- The time counted down and then it was counting up.
[53:54.74]The game is so loud.
[53:57.50]Okay.
[54:03.29]This is a stopwatch.
[54:06.19]So I have to be here within 10 seconds, and then I have to... I thought I was up against the clock.
[54:11.81]I wasn't.
[54:13.85]I kept looking up and seeing, oh, 20 seconds left, 30 seconds left, 40 seconds left.
[54:18.13]I was like, what's... How am I... Am I running over little, like, watches or something?
[54:21.56]Alright, I got it right now.
[54:38.67]I went, I took the wrong turn again.
[54:56.88]Okay, it doesn't matter because I have to be here within 10 seconds anyways.
[54:59.95]I'm here too early half the time.
[55:12.06]Somebody said it's still way too loud.
[55:23.21]That was a 3D movie maker effect.
[55:31.15]OK, here we are.
[55:35.21]Don't show up too early.
[55:41.26]Okay, now we go.
[55:43.90]Pick everybody up.
[55:47.24]Here comes the whole... Okay, now we get out of here.
[55:51.94]But I don't have to freak out here.
[55:53.67]I want to go up this main highway.
[56:11.68]Alright, let's go.
[56:12.16]There's way too many people on the road here.
[56:32.13]Uh oh.
[56:45.87]What the fuck?
[56:47.13]Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[56:48.81]Okay, I think I was weaving around and the police officer ran into somebody.
[57:15.95]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[57:17.33]We're good.
[57:54.89]Let's go!
[58:03.72]Minute 45, what's wrong with that?
[58:04.92]Alright, this game's kind of fun.
[58:12.14]Oh, by the way, for those of you that are wondering, every 30 to 40 minutes, we switch games.
[58:17.16]It's been an hour, and I haven't switched.
[58:19.02]Too bad.
[58:30.71]Yeah, the intro was 20 minutes, that's true.
[58:33.90]We didn't really get into this until about 20 minutes ago.
[58:36.22]I still got about 20 minutes.
[58:41.38]There's so many games behind me.
[58:44.96]It is a daunting amount of video games and CDs that are right here.
[58:50.03]I look back just like, oh my goodness, okay, we've got a lot to do.
[58:55.68]20 plus 20 is 30.
[58:56.70]Well, 30 to 45 usually is the dealer.
[59:00.92]Alright, what about another job?
[59:06.98]Show them?
[59:07.38]No, I don't want to give any spoilers.
[59:11.40]You have two new messages.
[59:15.96]It's me.
[59:17.30]You did good.
[59:18.86]We got a real hot car.
[59:20.86]We gotta get it out of here by afternoon.
[59:23.44]We need plates changed.
[59:24.86]Respray, man.
[59:26.22]We need a whole **** workout.
[59:28.96]Get yourself down here if you want to work.
[59:31.60]But this car is hot, man.
[59:33.30]Who is censoring my calls for me?
[59:38.41]Was he doing that on his end?
[59:42.67]Name's Deco.
[59:44.03]I heard about you.
[59:45.09]I heard a lot about you.
[59:47.19]I need a ride.
[59:48.89]Don't bring no tail.
[59:51.66]Which one should I do?
[59:56.17]That's it?
[59:56.83]He left another message and just said, it's me.
[60:00.95]Oh, no, I skipped it.
[60:01.93]Which one should I do?
[60:05.81]The first one?
[60:08.35]Let's go.
[60:08.61]Alright, we'll do one more and see how I feel.
[60:13.39]And then we're going to move on to this next one.
[60:22.95]Hide the evidence.
[60:30.78]Okay.
[60:34.06]Take it to the breakers.
[60:35.60]New car.
[60:36.16]Okay.
[61:06.61]This car handles a lot differently.
[61:15.22]This dude is relentless.
[61:16.60]Get away from me.
[61:19.08]Oh wait, his car got fucked up.
[61:21.71]Alright, you can't hit anybody.
[61:22.81]Stop telling me to.
[61:36.72]We're going to do this again.
[61:44.68]When is the driver?
[61:45.48]No.
[61:45.90]What?
[61:46.08]I thought you said driver two.
[62:02.76]Boy.
[62:03.40]Yep.
[62:03.68]Yep.
[62:03.88]Yep.
[62:04.80]Okay.
[62:05.12]I get it.
[62:13.48]Good.
[62:17.32]Stop!
[62:17.62]Who cares?
[62:19.30]Just go!
[62:19.78]Why do I care so much about doing that?
[62:23.64]It's like just burning in the back of my head.
[62:49.15]What?
[62:49.77]There's a roadblock.
[62:54.20]Okay, we're not going that way.
[63:14.65]We'll go in a different way.
[63:29.16]Where's the cop?
[63:30.48]Okay, great.
[63:32.34]Then left.
[63:36.92]And then right.
[63:44.43]I tried to hit every single object on the way over here.
[63:52.57]Okay.
[63:58.49]Got no cops right now.
[64:00.06]That's good.
[64:17.67]I gotta do the Mario Kart technique.
[64:24.97]How have you not crashed already?
[64:26.41]Everybody does.
[64:35.40]If you do that in front of somebody, they freak out because they don't want to hit you while they're passing you.
[64:39.66]And then you'll make them spin out.
[65:01.07]How have you not crashed into somebody?
[65:11.42]Let's go.
[65:12.28]This place is far away.
[65:35.31]Oh, that jump did nothing for me at all.
[65:37.02]It ruined everything, actually.
[65:39.22]I was supposed to go off that way faster.
[65:40.68]That was very lame.
[65:46.09]I was supposed to go off that five times faster.
[65:55.28]That was lame.
[66:11.02]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[66:14.58]One more.
[66:16.08]Blow right by this cop right here.
[66:25.91]180.
[66:35.78]I love when cars harmonize in video games, don't you?
[66:41.07]You know, like... We're harmonizing.
[66:57.32]Stop!
[66:57.84]Stop it!
[66:58.34]Stop!
[66:58.92]Stop!
[67:23.43]Nice.
[67:26.03]You should stick to TikTok.
[67:30.05]Dude, I've never opened the app TikTok.
[67:34.13]Once.
[67:41.89]Whenever I tell you guys about watching TikTok, it's like going to TikTok.com.
[67:49.70]And usually getting a link that somebody sent.
[67:53.42]I've never opened it.
[67:55.46]Or I look at TikTok compilation videos.
[68:04.09]That's the same thing, is it?
[68:05.67]I don't have like a TikTok account.
[68:08.13]Somebody's like, oh, look at this TikTok video I found.
[68:10.03]I just open it on like a website.
[68:11.29]I go, oh, that was okay.
[68:13.19]I don't care.
[68:15.75]You're addicted.
[68:17.57]I don't watch TikTok.
[68:19.25]I don't.
[68:20.25]Stop it.
[68:22.13]That's worse.
[68:22.47]What do you mean?
[68:28.24]How is that worse?
[68:28.90]Alright, we'll do one more mission and then we'll move on.
[68:39.75]We want to talk to you.
[68:44.22]That's it?
[68:46.41]Oh.
[68:47.35]Okay.
[68:58.34]Am I going to get double-crossed?
[69:02.02]You need to do Driver 1 all stream.
[69:03.60]No.
[69:06.46]No, that's not happening.
[69:07.13]There's like 500 games behind me.
[69:19.72]Alright, I'm actually in time for this one.
[69:21.68]Go meet them.
[69:26.88]Is that, are they on the map right there?
[69:29.10]Where, where is, where are they?
[69:32.11]What am I, I don't know.
[69:32.61]Where am I supposed to be going?
[69:34.61]Can I go over here?
[69:45.76]Hey, driver crawled so GTA could walk, okay?
[69:51.88]All you haters in the chat right now.
[70:06.57]What did I do?
[70:10.46]Except GTA 1 came out probably like five years before this game.
[70:20.13]Do I have to bring the cops?
[70:26.34]What did you say?
[70:26.88]The driver was made for aliens so they wouldn't get attached to Earth.
[70:40.89]What does that even mean?
[70:57.37]Where's the road?
[71:09.97]Dude, the frame rate drops to like zero right there.
[71:13.15]Look at this, why is it chugging so hard?
[71:27.14]Which road should I go on, this one or the big one?
[71:36.39]Alright, I just bounced.
[71:50.00]Oh, come on.
[71:57.64]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[71:58.58]Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch!
[72:10.34]This is so far away still.
[72:13.78]There's no way I do this one.
[72:17.29]One more try and that's it.
[72:18.69]That's it.
[72:19.07]One last try.
[72:20.05]And then I'm gonna put in a different game.
[72:21.63]Final... One last try.
[72:22.95]One try.
[72:31.39]That one didn't count.
[72:33.81]That one didn't count.
[72:42.90]Okay, go.
[72:51.84]I'm not gonna go right.
[72:53.16]I'm gonna go straight here, right?
[72:57.27]And then go down this road over here.
[72:59.45]This one right here.
[73:04.77]Yep, yep.
[73:05.55]Okay, go, go, go, go.
[73:07.37]Down this main highway right here.
[73:11.96]Why was I speeding?
[73:12.78]Why am I in trouble?
[73:13.38]I didn't do anything.
[73:15.64]I didn't do anything.
[73:29.46]Did I do it?
[73:29.96]Did I fuck it up?
[73:31.88]I went down the wrong thing, didn't I?
[73:34.02]No, I'm okay.
[73:34.40]I'm alright.
[73:36.43]Can I go down this way?
[73:39.77]I can't tell from the map.
[73:46.33]Dude, I can't tell from the map.
[73:49.25]Oh, come on.
[73:50.17]Doesn't that look like I can drive down there?
[73:54.32]What even is that?
[73:57.54]I'm doing this one more time, I swear to God.
[74:01.53]You did the same mistake.
[74:03.29]Alright, I'm not making that mistake again.
[74:04.79]This is the last try.
[74:06.15]And then I'm putting in a... I'm putting in the Land Before Time racing adventure.
[74:17.30]I'm not making that same mistake every time.
[74:29.85]I'm going left.
[74:30.27]You're gonna think it's crazy, but I'm doing it.
[74:37.07]Now we're gonna go right up here.
[74:45.19]And then I'm gonna go straight.
[74:48.53]And then...
[75:03.97]I'm gonna go right up here.
[75:05.95]And straight go.
[75:07.09]Just stay straight the whole time.
[75:39.59]There we go.
[75:40.05]Okay, we're good.
[75:40.77]Alright, there's a roadblock up here.
[75:42.77]I have to go through it very slowly.
[76:14.66]That fucking idiot wasn't in the way.
[76:16.70]It was a good fight.
[76:18.28]Alright, I think he crashed.
[77:09.92]Thank you.
[77:53.80]Where's the entrance?
[77:56.82]Where's the entrance?
[77:57.58]Isn't there a bigger entrance?
[78:00.10]What?
[78:00.68]I thought there was a bigger entrance.
[78:13.65]I went way too far.
[78:14.73]Alright, this is it right here.
[78:15.75]If I don't get it right here, I'm literally turning off the console and pulling up this...
[78:39.32]Sorry.
[78:55.08]Where's the road I can go down?
[78:56.38]Is it this one here?
[79:01.62]I don't know.
[79:02.52]The big shadow is taking up the whole mini map.
[79:04.76]I can't see.
[79:47.03]Why are my eyes so watery?
[79:57.35]No, no.
[79:58.77]No!
[79:58.91]It was the wrong road!
[80:00.39]Oh my god, it's the wrong fucking road.
[80:02.66]There's one road to get over there.
[80:05.70]There's one road, and it's...
[80:29.47]Check it out.
[80:29.79]This is it right here.
[80:30.41]I swear to God.
[80:41.87]I swear to God, this is it.
[80:42.85]I got it right here.
[80:44.13]I got it.
[80:49.75]It was a perfect... There was no avoiding that car crash.
[80:53.79]They were coming from every piece, every angle.
[80:57.24]There was no escaping.
[80:58.62]Everyone was driving to stop me from completing this mission.
[81:17.02]Stop driving into me.
[81:18.06]Alright, here it is.
[81:23.63]This one right here.
[81:26.95]Go.
[81:27.03]Alright, making good time.
[81:42.66]Good time.
[81:51.29]No, it's not the wrong road.
[81:52.30]Look, I was up to the one to the right.
[81:54.08]The road to the right.
[81:54.74]That's when I was up before.
[81:55.78]I'm on the right one.
[82:00.92]There's a block here.
[82:03.78]Save.
[82:05.95]Stop talking.
[82:11.27]I got it for sure.
[82:36.82]Yes, I got it
[83:12.73]Need you to make an exchange.
[83:14.61]This case for a locker key.
[83:16.21]It's a sweet deal.
[83:17.41]Cash for a key.
[83:18.49]In and out.
[83:19.01]Wham!
[83:19.41]Bam!
[83:19.81]Boom!
[83:20.87]Meet them at the marina.
[83:22.15]Get the key or stay out of town.
[83:26.31]This message is crazy.
[83:28.47]I just slammed my head so hard against the top of my doorframe, putting up lights.
[83:33.40]And all I could hear was the obscenely loud sirens playing from the game on my laptop.
[83:37.94]For a second, I truly believed I fucking died to a Jerma stream.
[83:42.52]Oh, no.
[83:46.00]You alright?
[83:47.92]Oh, wait, what's this?
[83:48.78]Alright, we're doing it.
[83:51.26]Last one, I promise.
[83:57.21]The last thing you hear is like, I don't understand.
[84:02.27]I don't get it.
[84:04.65]I hit the brake button.
[84:05.88]I hit the brake button.
[84:10.35]That whoa that's weird thing to I don't know about that one That's terrifying
[84:39.43]Go over the jump!
[84:40.23]I'm so angry at myself for missing that.
[84:52.12]I'm very annoyed at myself.
[84:53.90]I think I got it.
[85:17.88]I'm almost there!
[85:20.66]I'm almost there!
[86:01.55]That was Driver 1, and it was a good one.
[86:06.27]We played that for a little while.
[86:07.31]It was fun.
[86:08.89]Worth the wait, I think.
[86:11.45]But coming up next, we've got the Land Before Time Racing Adventure.
[86:18.61]This is going to be crazy, I think.
[86:21.91]This is going to be crazy.
[86:24.20]Oops.
[86:25.12]Wait, what?
[86:26.18]Oh, wait, I want to do this.
[86:27.80]No, I got it.
[86:28.70]Why did that just happen?
[86:31.33]Okay.
[86:32.41]Alright.
[86:34.77]Finally, it's time for a real game.
[86:36.45]I mean, Driver 1 is a very popular real game.
[86:41.24]Here we go.
[86:44.06]Yeah, for the game that I'm playing, yeah, just leave it as retro.
[86:46.68]There's no reason to change it.
[86:47.88]They'll be cycling so much, it's not worth it.
[86:49.56]Alright, here we go.
[86:51.21]Land before time.
[87:00.97]Yeah, I'm on a PS2 right now.
[87:04.13]PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1.
[87:05.42]If you have a PS2.
[87:07.94]At least the Slim model.
[87:09.02]I don't know.
[87:10.30]At least the Slim model.
[87:12.82]Whatever that means.
[87:13.86]Is that the one that's backwards compatible?
[87:22.52]Because if you have a PS2 Slim, you can play PS1 games in it.
[87:28.36]Are they all backwards compatible?
[87:29.60]Okay.
[87:29.94]That was wild.
[87:30.94]Okay.
[87:57.37]If you gave me a million dollars, I wouldn't be able to name one character.
[88:18.88]This is infomercial music when they're showing off the grill.
[88:23.11]And introducing the new wave of it.
[88:28.36]Cook.
[88:29.66]Clean.
[88:31.48]Store.
[88:38.70]You need at least one free block in the memory card in slot one.
[88:42.06]Okay.
[88:42.56]What should I do?
[88:44.16]Obstacle courses?
[88:57.86]Difficulty.
[88:58.70]Pick an obstacle course.
[89:01.50]Three star dash, rolling hills dash, dino dash, stone den dash.
[89:09.12]This is the first one.
[89:10.74]Pick a runner.
[89:13.82]Yep.
[89:14.12]Right, ducky.
[89:16.82]How about either ducky or spike?
[89:26.18]What do you think?
[89:34.04]Alright, here we go.
[89:50.03]What is going?
[89:54.89]Holy shit, this game is awesome.
[89:56.23]This is like the iPhone run games before they were popular.
[90:03.58]Oops.
[90:14.51]What?
[90:14.99]Oh, I didn't jump.
[90:15.75]Okay, I'm good.
[90:16.95]Fuck.
[90:17.61]Sorry.
[90:18.39]Oh my god.
[90:36.67]Whoa!
[90:37.43]Okay, you can swim on that.
[90:39.95]What's the time I need to beat?
[90:56.97]There we go.
[90:57.39]Ooh, got it.
[91:11.07]I think you go faster if you collect flowers.
[91:38.49]I don't know how you do that reliably.
[91:39.53]I don't understand.
[91:46.45]Not bad.
[91:50.61]That wasn't that bad.
[91:57.31]This looks like you if you were a nice... Oh, I didn't do it.
[92:03.66]I think I could do... Alright, what about this one?
[92:05.06]What about Dino Dash?
[92:06.32]Let's try this one.
[92:08.26]We'll do Ducky.
[92:10.66]Maybe they all have different traits.
[92:17.74]140 is what I need.
[92:18.66]Okay.
[92:28.32]Well, now I understand what kind of game it is.
[92:29.70]I didn't know what it was before.
[92:30.66]It's like an auto-run game.
[92:37.80]I jumped over it.
[93:00.92]I think you have to go through the middle of those.
[93:23.04]Yeah, you can't jump over those.
[93:52.01]I got it.
[93:52.27]Alright.
[93:52.51]140.
[93:52.79]Johto!
[93:53.13]There's more?
[94:23.53]I'm so sorry.
[94:29.08]I love that harsh audio clipping that you hear.
[94:34.78]It's like, reading memory card.
[94:38.20]You hear that just noise.
[94:43.12]Oh, okay.
[94:43.88]I unlocked more.
[94:44.54]Alright, let me get this one then.
[94:47.90]We'll do Sarah.
[95:00.14]Do I race too?
[95:02.28]After this we'll do a race.
[95:05.81]Can you please drink from a hamster water bottle?
[95:08.27]No.
[95:11.73]We already went over why that stream would be bad.
[95:27.84]Why?
[95:28.56]Because it would be stupid.
[95:33.83]Anytime I ever think of something that would be fun or interesting to do on stream, for like a show or an event, I think about the one thing I think is funny.
[95:41.67]And then I go, alright, can it be built off of that one thing I think is funny?
[95:47.22]And yeah, me drinking out of a hamster bottle is funny.
[95:51.20]But then imagine the panic I would have to have to fill like three or four hours of a stream.
[95:56.92]Doing what, exactly?
[95:59.42]That's like...
[96:01.25]I would be in, like, a hamster costume.
[96:04.67]I would do the funny, look, I'm drinking out of the thing!
[96:08.60]And then I'd have a panic attack internally, going, what else is there to do now?
[96:14.46]Oh my god, this, how much does this cost?
[96:20.93]I would just be like, there's nothing else to do.
[96:22.41]There's nothing else funny.
[96:23.45]What else is funny that could happen right now?
[96:29.63]This is bullshit.
[96:30.75]Just walk across it.
[96:31.97]Babe.
[96:34.09]It would be a one minute stream.
[96:39.45]It would just be you running in the hamster wheel.
[96:51.89]I would sprint on that hamster wheel and I would trip and I would go.
[96:57.43]I would fall and just kind of be spinning in it.
[97:00.78]I would just puke, and then the stream would have to turn off, and I'd get banned for a week.
[97:05.42]What a fucking terrible stream.
[97:10.33]Alright, how about, uh, Windy Ridge Race?
[97:22.38]I'll be ducky.
[97:27.46]Hamster Wheel Subathon.
[97:28.86]Oh, no way.
[97:45.17]Oh my god, I was trying to cut the corner.
[97:46.77]Fuck.
[98:04.44]Get it!
[98:11.08]What song is this?
[98:11.58]What song is this?
[98:12.88]What song is this?
[98:13.92]What is that?
[98:14.58]This is a real song.
[98:17.60]Turn around.
[98:18.20]Yeah, that's what it is.
[98:19.40]Okay.
[98:36.59]Turn around.
[98:38.23]Every now and again I get a little bit closer.
[98:46.09]Turn around.
[98:59.58]No, it's different now.
[99:03.70]Play that song.
[99:05.56]Hold on.
[99:08.42]He's going to pass me.

[109:18.91]But I don't know.
[109:19.65]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[109:20.94]I don't have a reason to.

[110:02.09]Why are you so much faster?
[110:41.00]One more time.
[110:48.83]If you played this music in a room with two people, they would kill each other.
[110:53.67]Why?
[110:58.89]No, I wouldn't.
[111:00.18]I actually wouldn't do that.
[111:01.22]I would go, this music's kind of weird.
[111:03.60]Oh, yeah.
[111:06.12]I'd like to leave the room now.
[111:08.76]Who cares?
[111:29.38]Every now and then I get a little bit closer.
[111:38.37]This game is fucking impossible.
[111:40.07]I would have cried if I was a kid playing this.

[132:01.36]We have to do this.
[132:03.10]Where's the lobby?
[132:08.09]No, I don't want to play craps.
[132:18.76]PlayStation version was released on two separate discs with one containing the game story mode So maybe maybe that's accurate maybe it is on the other disc Okay, let's try that Registration new let's see if it does it here.
[132:40.75]Did you get a coupon in here?
[132:42.04]I don't think so new oh
[132:47.98]Chaos mystery!
[132:50.54]Chaos mystery mode!
[132:52.51]Are you kidding me?
[132:53.33]This is chaos mode.
[133:01.71]Let's go.
[133:02.19]This is it.
[133:15.83]Chaos theory.
[133:19.00]And you.
[133:22.90]For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost.
[133:26.56]A butterfly that stirs the air in Peking might cause an earthquake in San Francisco.
[133:33.14]To an observer, there's no connection, only chaos.
[133:37.72]Chaos is the science of everything we see, the formation of a cloud, the clustering of stars.
[133:45.39]Mountains aren't cones.
[133:47.57]Clouds aren't spheres.
[133:49.99]The world is made of zigs and zags, random, erratic, unpredictable.
[133:58.33]Yet deep inside the chaos looks an even eerier order.
[134:02.75]And the key to this world exists now.
[134:07.39]The chaos chip.
[134:08.99]The chaos chip?
[134:10.01]With the proper interface, this new microprocessor will compute outcomes using data compiled sheerly from nature's mood swings, weather patterns, life expectancy.
[134:24.98]What?
[134:25.32]The roll of a die.
[134:27.62]The turn of a card.
[134:31.84]We could just play cards, too, you know.
[134:34.84]What happened?
[134:36.03]Well, at best guess, I'd say this computer your company makes has a bit of a bad motivator.
[134:40.49]How'd the part you heard sound?
[134:42.19]No big words, but they'll fund you.
[134:44.19]I'm sure they will after the card tricks.
[134:47.68]The expo's tomorrow.
[134:49.00]It's not like I have time to predict the presidential election.
[134:56.96]You're not gonna answer the door?
[134:58.54]Go answer the fucking door.
[134:59.66]Chaos.
[135:26.33]What is up?
[135:33.09]Uh-oh.
[135:43.60]Dr. Harkness, I presume.
[135:45.50]No shock or quick movements, please.
[135:49.45]Just the chip.
[135:50.75]Now.
[135:52.15]Chip?
[135:53.27]The chaos one.
[135:54.66]The one you designed, it's location.
[135:57.60]Who are you?
[135:59.34]Call me Chiraco, but quietly.
[136:03.26]We don't want to wake the neighbors.
[136:06.04]Get it.
[136:06.34]I actually don't.
[136:09.20]Let me tell the ways.
[136:15.20]Get him.
[136:16.01]You just passed it to him.
[136:27.44]Where is it?
[136:33.45]I thought I hit her right in the head.
[136:34.85]I thought I hit her directly in the head.
[136:35.85]I was like, holy shit.
[136:40.11]What is this?
[136:40.53]This is just a spray painted shoebox.
[136:47.15]He's gone.
[136:54.25]So where is the mystery chest?
[137:01.51]I have a theory.
[137:02.50]I'll tell you in a minute.
[137:06.08]Steven, it's me.
[137:07.96]Look, don't say anything.
[137:10.72]I know that it's been forever and we didn't part on the greatest of terms, but I need your help.
[137:15.87]I'm in a real mess.
[137:18.95]I'm here, too, at the Golden Nugget.
[137:22.80]I hope your poker skills are intact.
[137:24.46]Just listen, I don't have much time.
[137:28.38]Someone stole something very important from my hotel room.
[137:31.14]It's a microchip.
[137:31.92]It's a processor that... Do I puke up cards?
[137:36.86]Am I like a monster-like person?
[137:38.88]Why am I throwing up cards?
[137:39.98]They left something behind in my hotel room.
[137:42.30]It's a registration form for the poker tournament.
[137:45.99]There's some writing on the back I can't quite make out.
[137:50.09]Don't leave it there.
[137:51.11]Why can't you just give it to me?
[137:52.73]Okay.
[138:25.83]sexy scientist super invention stolen.
[138:32.70]But wait, wait, wait.
[138:36.48]You will need to have $20,000 to enter the poker scene.
[138:42.68]Why does that headline have to say sexy?
[138:45.44]That's bizarre.
[138:47.37]What the fuck is the point of that?
[138:51.12]Okay.
[138:52.96]I have a theory.
[138:54.82]The theory that I have is that the golden nugget, I mean, these casinos rake in billions.
[139:02.99]And I'm imagining that they probably had a hundred million dollar budget for this game.
[139:07.88]And the developers and coders were like, okay, we made Blackjack, we made Kino, and we did poker, it kind of, or we're done.
[139:14.66]What do you mean you're done?
[139:15.98]Yeah, we're done.
[139:17.30]We finished the game.
[139:18.12]It's just like Blackjack and shit.
[139:19.56]There's like a million of these apps.
[139:21.64]There are 100 million of these on the App Store, on discs.
[139:24.55]There's so many of them.
[139:25.87]Oh, well.
[139:27.21]Just take the other 98 million and make a movie with Adam West.
[139:32.95]Why?
[139:33.39]That sounds like a bad idea.
[139:34.75]Just do it.
[139:36.87]Do it.
[139:37.15]Just spend the other, like, 75 million.
[139:40.41]It's just that... Alright, I'm in.
[139:42.48]I'm in long-term, by the way.
[139:45.22]Alright, I need $20,000.
[139:48.04]Gotta make this happen.
[139:50.42]On the App Store in the 90s.
[139:51.84]Alright.
[139:53.78]We gotta get to 20k.
[139:55.28]How much do I have right now?
[139:56.74]I have 10,000.
[140:00.50]We need to go register.
[140:05.19]I need to save the game.
[140:11.05]Alright, save it.
[140:12.69]Right there.
[140:14.57]I'm ready.

[156:01.89]You've made it into the first poker tournament.
[156:03.55]There's no time to waste.
[156:05.67]So hurry to the poker suite before they start without you.
[156:10.63]Okay.
[156:13.74]Let's go.
[156:17.13]Welcome, Mr. Kellsberg.
[156:18.37]I'm glad you could make it.
[156:21.31]My dear sir, there simply are no vacancies.
[156:24.74]I find no record of your reservation whatsoever.
[156:27.82]Look, I'll pay you anything reasonable.
[156:30.78]Come on.
[156:32.38]What do you say?
[156:33.00]Is the poker room?
[156:34.22]Look, may as well let the white shirt in.
[156:35.91]Ducelli's late anyway.
[156:37.13]Give him Henry's spot.
[156:39.33]Too late.
[156:40.75]It's already mine.
[156:42.85]If I may be of assistance.
[156:49.57]Mr. Swain.
[156:51.82]Mr. Farland may have my seat for the first joust.
[156:54.68]It seems I have business elsewhere.
[156:56.64]There you go.
[156:58.20]Well, well.
[156:59.26]Wait, who are we?
[156:59.60]So you're Killsburg.
[157:01.98]Shelley's told me so much about you.
[157:03.92]My name's Swain, but anybody who knows me from Adam calls me Hugh.
[157:08.59]I gathered from your body language that you're a left-handed card player.
[157:12.89]A little disconcerting since I see that
[157:16.27]You've neglected the laces on your right shoe.
[157:20.17]A stress level that could only be related to the jitters before a high stakes game of chance.
[157:28.10]Or to the comments I overheard this morning from a young woman at the pay phones downstairs since she called her speaker, Stevie.
[157:36.32]This is fucking awesome.
[157:40.93]It can only be assumed
[157:44.36]That you're he and here for her.
[157:47.68]Or one of us has become vaguely confused.
[157:52.25]Though my suspicions perhaps sound deranged to the common ear,
[157:57.02]I think there's more to this friendly game of chance than meets the eye.
[158:00.72]You keep that eye on your opponent.
[158:03.52]The cigar's not lit.
[158:04.75]I'll be in touch.
[158:06.57]It's your turn at bat.
[158:09.55]Mr. Slane, I'm just the pizza guy.
[158:12.71]Can you sign for this?
[158:13.39]I don't know what you're talking about.
[158:17.17]Gentlemen, ladies, welcome to the Golden Nugget and this year's preliminary poker invitational.
[158:23.26]Beginning on my right, please state the names by which you wish to be known.
[158:27.42]I'm Joanna Kurtz.
[158:28.82]Hello, everyone.
[158:29.92]Ben Farland.
[158:31.14]Great to be surrounded by all of you.
[158:33.88]Especially the famous Mr. Killsburg, who needs no introduction.
[158:38.34]You're a weird guy.
[158:39.42]Mr. Farland.
[158:40.82]Mr. Killsburg.
[158:42.00]Welcome.
[158:42.68]Wait, we can't introduce ourselves?
[158:44.78]Short for Tracy.
[158:46.58]Sirocco, if anything.
[158:49.63]Sheila Warwick.
[158:50.65]Call me whatever you like, within reason.
[158:53.55]Thank you all.
[158:55.67]Let's get started.
[158:59.08]Alright, here we go.
[159:00.48]I can't fuck this up.
[159:01.34]This is a big poker tournament.
[159:07.69]This is not... I... What?
[159:12.63]Everybody, it's time for the billionaires to play with $25 a hand.
[159:15.19]What the fuck is this?
[159:30.73]How do you play poker?
[159:35.27]What kind of poker is this?
[159:36.75]I don't know what we're playing.
[159:38.05]What kind of poker is this?
[159:39.91]What's that mean?
[159:40.71]I raise.
[159:41.17]I call.
[159:41.43]I don't know what's going on.
[159:42.17]I call.
[159:43.07]I'm out.
[159:43.41]I don't know what's happening.
[159:45.83]You may fold, call, or raise.
[159:48.75]I got queen high.
[159:50.41]What kind of poker is this?
[159:52.03]Is it Texas hold'em?
[159:53.39]Five card draw?
[159:54.99]Because queen high, that's pretty good, right?
[159:56.96]I will raise.
[159:58.68]I call.
[159:59.66]I'm out.
[160:03.04]I call.
[160:03.70]I call.
[160:04.20]I call.
[160:04.82]Can we see other cards?
[160:12.36]Okay, so now what?
[160:15.69]I check.
[160:16.13]Queen, 10.
[160:17.63]You may check or bet.
[160:18.55]I don't know what that means.
[160:19.29]I'm... This is a pretty good hand.
[160:22.25]This is a pretty good hand.
[160:23.75]It's five cards stud.
[160:26.37]Okay.
[160:28.61]I got queen, 10 suited.
[160:30.51]Pretty good.
[160:31.49]Check.
[160:32.51]I bet.

[160:34.36]I call.

[160:41.99]I call.
[160:45.23]You got a pair of sevens?
[160:46.39]That's nothing to my fucking royal flush!
[160:52.82]You may fold, call, or raise.
[160:55.36]I need a queen under there.
[161:04.78]I need a queen under here, right?
[161:11.20]I raise.
[161:12.16]I raise.
[161:12.88]I call.
[161:13.62]I call.
[161:14.46]You may fold, call, or raise.
[161:18.06]I call.
[161:18.42]I'm gonna have a queen under here.
[161:19.76]Flip him.
[161:22.33]Flip him!
[161:29.07]You may fold, call, or raise.
[161:30.97]Why do I have so many cards?
[161:34.51]One, two, three, four, five, six cards now.
[161:38.78]Is it seven card stud?
[161:40.08]Uh-oh.
[161:47.58]I think I got a queen under there.
[161:49.28]I call.
[161:50.02]I call.
[161:50.87]You may fold, call, or raise.
[161:52.95]I call.
[161:53.25]I've got a queen.
[161:55.45]Flip that queen.
[161:56.39]I'm going to flip a queen.
[161:58.07]Watch this.
[161:59.91]Flip it a queen.
[162:00.45]Boom.
[162:03.91]You may fold, call, or raise.
[162:06.23]I raise.

[162:09.49]You may fold, call, or raise.
[162:11.60]I call.
[162:11.96]Nothing to clean, I win.
[162:13.46]I'm getting too close to this guy's cards.
[162:22.32]What are my cards?
[162:26.60]Where are my cards?
[162:28.92]What?
[162:29.20]I don't get to show my cards?
[162:36.92]Where are they?
[162:46.05]You had nothing.
[162:46.73]You ate them.
[162:47.61]You dropped your hand on the ground.
[162:52.15]Deal.
[162:54.01]I guess I lost, but I didn't even see what I had for a hand.
[163:03.12]Okay.
[163:05.50]I'm out.
[163:07.28]Already?
[163:08.83]I raise.
[163:09.67]I'm out.
[163:10.51]Why?
[163:11.17]You can't even see what you have.
[163:12.09]You have a clean high.
[163:12.95]I call.
[163:13.29]I'm out.
[163:13.83]What are they doing?
[163:16.05]You may fold, call, or raise.
[163:17.75]It's just me and the guy with the king.
[163:19.51]Let's go.
[163:19.97]Raise.
[163:20.25]I call.
[163:21.15]I call.
[163:21.79]I call.
[163:27.19]Give me a Jack.
[163:29.43]Oh.
[163:30.07]I check.
[163:30.97]Okay.
[163:31.86]I check.
[163:32.72]This is not bad.
[163:33.80]You may check or bet.
[163:34.68]It's Jack.
[163:35.56]I check.
[163:35.94]Flip him.
[163:36.24]Flip him.
[163:36.64]Flip him.
[163:39.20]Alright, now we raise.
[163:40.72]Now we raise.
[163:41.66]I raise.
[163:42.62]I raise.
[163:43.34]I call.
[163:46.27]I call.

[163:59.37]I call.
[164:00.21]You may fold, call, or raise.

[164:19.53]I call.
[164:22.59]We got... What do I have?
[164:28.37]Food, please.
[164:28.75]I'm out.
[164:31.81]You fucking have aces under there!
[164:33.33]What?! !
[164:51.67]I want to go see Adam West again.
[164:53.13]I call.
[164:56.09]I'm out.
[164:58.61]I call.
[164:59.41]You may vote, call, or raise.
[165:01.53]I mean, everybody kind of has a shitty hand, so I might as well... I call.
[165:04.86]I'm out.
[165:08.24]I call.
[165:09.02]I call.
[165:18.90]I check.
[165:20.29]I check.
[165:20.67]You would.
[165:21.89]You may check or bet.
[165:27.38]The hearts.
[165:29.58]I check.
[165:33.65]I can't believe we're doing $25 hands.
[165:35.25]You may fold, call, or raise.
[165:38.13]This is awful.
[165:39.05]I mean, five, six, seven.
[165:40.91]I could.
[165:42.11]I raise.
[165:43.01]I call.
[165:43.79]I call.
[165:44.61]You may fold, call, or raise.
[165:55.05]I call.
[165:55.86]No, I'm out.
[165:56.58]Get out.
[165:56.88]Get out of here.
[165:57.78]Yeah, look at this bullshit.
[166:03.58]Did you act?
[166:04.06]Are you sure you can't look at the flipped cards?
[166:10.14]I don't think so.
[166:10.86]I think that's how this works.
[166:16.63]I call.
[166:17.13]I call.
[166:17.75]I'm out.
[166:21.02]You may fold, call, or raise.

[166:29.41]I'm just going to raise every time.
[166:30.37]I call.
[166:31.19]I call.
[166:31.39]I call.
[166:31.71]And just try to liquidate them all eventually.
[166:35.67]Will I liquidate myself?
[166:43.78]Ooh.
[166:44.54]I check.
[166:44.96]Alright.
[166:46.16]I check.
[166:46.82]We got Queen Jack.
[166:47.96]I check.
[166:48.92]Not suited.
[166:49.40]I check.
[166:49.64]It's alright.
[166:51.31]You may check or bet.

[166:59.00]I call.
[166:59.94]I call.
[167:02.92]It's kind of quiet.
[167:05.52]I look over like Adam West is sleeping on that couch.
[167:10.74]Yeah, he had all that shit to say.
[167:12.64]I raise.
[167:13.16]I raise.
[167:14.18]You may fold, call, or raise.
[167:18.16]Well, the Pink Queen Jack, that's... I can't be that.
[167:25.74]I call.
[167:26.66]I call.
[167:27.60]I call.
[167:28.08]I call.
[167:28.78]I call.
[167:29.42]How long do you sit here for to do this?
[167:41.89]I rave.
[167:42.84]I raise.
[167:43.60]I call.
[167:44.34]I call.
[167:45.32]Jack, queen, ten.
[167:46.56]Is that a nine?
[167:47.14]Dude, I'm close.
[167:49.16]Is that a six?
[167:49.82]No, it's a... Wait.
[167:50.94]Shit.
[167:51.46]Is it a nine?
[167:52.04]It's a six.
[167:59.95]I call.
[168:00.89]I call.
[168:01.53]I need a king.
[168:03.21]I call.
[168:03.63]Let's go.
[168:04.85]Come on.
[168:05.43]Let me get this big pot here.
[168:06.85]Nine.
[168:10.65]Nine.
[168:12.32]9, 10.
[168:12.36]Come on.
[168:12.94]Give me straight.
[168:16.08]I raise.
[168:17.07]I raise.
[168:17.81]I call.
[168:18.55]I call.
[168:19.01]You may vote, call, or raise.
[168:21.55]I call.
[168:22.47]I call.
[168:23.41]I call.
[168:24.07]I call.
[168:24.81]I call.
[168:27.43]This is a big pot.
[168:28.09]Give it to me.
[168:28.45]Give me the straight.
[168:31.12]Do it.
[168:32.62]Come on.
[168:33.10]I'm out.
[168:35.20]5, 6.
[168:35.96]What is it?
[168:36.32]I'm out.
[168:37.20]What do I have?
[168:37.84]I'm out.
[168:43.53]I'm out.
[168:43.97]Did I win?
[168:47.99]Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a brief intermission.
[168:57.82]Did I win?
[169:03.54]Excuse me.
[169:05.92]It would seem the waters run deeper than I feared.
[169:08.08]Perhaps I should elaborate on our last conversation.
[169:10.66]No doubt you found it puzzling.
[169:14.21]You see, I was unwinding at the tables earlier.
[169:17.34]His cigar's bigger.
[169:18.12]His cigar grows when he tells a lie.
[169:19.50]As always, when in a large room filled with a symphony of hundreds of people engaged in hypnotic entertainment, I found myself lip-reading.
[169:29.05]Immediately, I recognized the renowned chaos theorist from today's front page.
[169:34.79]Yet though wracked with guilt for my invasion of her privacy, I soon noticed I wasn't the only one paying attention to a beautiful celebrity on the verge of collapse.
[169:51.60]Ed, Edd n Eddy?
[169:54.38]Is that Edd n Eddy music?
[170:05.18]Until that moment, my main reason for visiting the Golden Nugget had been the hope of winning enough to, well, let's just say I drive a guzzler and have a charming collection of pets.
[170:16.73]But suddenly I knew a storm was gathering, and this scrap of paper began to look like the only umbrella in the entire Western state.
[170:29.44]Since we last spoke.
[170:32.38]I examined this tell-tale chatter using what few items in my crime lab I had time to pack in my duck case.
[170:40.79]Although encrypted in pig Latin, I decipher this curious phrase written on the back in fresh black ink.
[170:49.00]Why was six afraid of seven?
[170:52.74]Bullets over kings.
[170:54.10]He's making this up.
[170:55.64]I'll run this through the computer.
[170:56.68]You keep an eye out here.
[170:57.98]The fiend who tons this with these dastardly rib ticklers.
[171:01.14]This guy's a weirdo.
[171:01.94]May very well be one of your conniving companions.
[171:04.38]That's a CVS receipt for one coconut water.
[171:07.68]Keep them clueless, casually, if can.
[171:10.74]No, save your questions till later.
[171:13.56]I'm in motion.
[171:20.93]Can we get you anything, Mr. Killsburg?
[171:24.07]Yes, I would like.
[171:26.71]Wasn't Mr. Swain with you a moment ago?
[171:29.17]No, no, it was a different guy.
[171:30.65]That was a different guy.
[171:38.29]Alright, here we go.
[171:38.93]I got to keep this going.
[171:40.53]I got to keep it going.
[171:41.17]I can't just go to zero.
[171:46.89]We got to see how this plays out.
[171:56.98]Hmm.
[171:57.72]Yeah, two jacks, two eights, two pair.
[172:07.35]No way.
[172:07.69]I would have lost.
[172:10.05]ResidentSleeper gameplay.
[172:14.17]Get back to the cutscenes.
[172:20.46]Everybody... Okay.
[172:21.20]You know what?
[172:21.64]I'm playing.
[172:22.54]Everybody's got good shit.
[172:23.88]Let's start.
[172:25.30]Let's go.
[172:29.27]Ask for the beer plus milk.
[172:30.59]Never mind.
[172:35.59]It's been six hours.
[172:36.45]It hadn't even been three.
[172:41.75]Alright.
[172:43.53]Is there a Jax already?
[172:44.97]Uh, whatever.
[172:45.79]Just watch the cutscenes on YouTube.
[172:48.25]No!
[172:48.31]I need to earn it!
[172:49.39]I call.
[173:11.31]That's not bad.
[173:13.73]That's not bad.
[173:16.67]I call.
[173:17.19]Please, we want to see Spyro.
[173:19.35]What makes you think I have Spyro here right now?
[173:23.63]I don't have Spyro.
[173:29.82]I have Spyro.
[173:33.30]I call.

[176:49.60]It sucks.
[176:51.74]Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a brief intermission.
[177:04.60]You really are an excellent player.
[177:06.44]You know that?
[177:06.96]I lost every hand.
[177:10.00]I guess you recognize me.
[177:11.80]Max Chilton's my father.
[177:13.60]He's in town to unveil his new Atom Smasher at tomorrow's expo.
[177:17.87]Personally, I've never understood any of the stuff his company makes.
[177:22.35]RAM, ROM, it's all geek to me.
[177:26.20]So he gave me a little pocket change, and here we are.
[177:31.20]Two people talking.
[177:34.94]Save my spot.
[177:36.90]Hey there.
[177:38.10]Steven Kilsberg.
[177:39.90]Two L's B-O-U-R-G.
[177:42.51]Am I right?
[177:43.55]Correct.
[177:44.37]Those are not your chips.
[177:46.45]Those are not your chips.
[177:47.69]You didn't save her a spot.
[178:10.67]And now Max Chilton owns my old company, and I'm Girl Friday for an obnoxious tycoon.
[178:17.79]I'll tell you one thing.
[178:19.76]When I've won enough to get my new company off the ground, Daddy Bucks Chilton is going to learn to run good cut.
[178:27.40]I don't like any of this.
[178:29.23]Deserves enough.
[178:34.07]I would just stay home and just like watch TV.
[178:36.81]You know what I mean?
[178:37.57]Like my company was purchased by this firm and then I need to go.
[178:42.09]Like, I'm just going to go.
[178:42.90]I'm staying home.
[178:43.94]I don't want to deal with like all like the rich people shit.
[178:46.34]You know what I mean?
[178:47.08]Like, I don't, I would never want to be in this room.
[178:49.82]People just striding in, sitting down, looking you right in the eye.
[178:52.68]So, what's your story?
[178:55.17]What company did you buy?
[178:56.19]And it's like, I don't fucking want to be here.
[178:58.03]I don't want to be here.
[178:59.65]I want to just get high and watch TV on my couch.
[179:03.03]I would never be there.
[179:06.07]I don't want to have somebody sit down and look at me like that and talk to me like that.
[179:10.72]I don't know.
[179:11.14]I just would never want to do that.
[179:16.56]It's like so much drama.
[179:20.89]I don't want to, like, have a cigar in my mouth and be like, yes.
[179:24.31]Now, let's talk about the drama between the rich people.
[179:27.71]No, no, no.
[179:29.27]I'm staying home.
[179:36.68]You bought my company?
[179:38.10]And I'm mad?
[179:38.62]No.
[179:38.88]How much money did I make in the sale?
[179:42.38]You see, my father bought your company.
[179:45.79]How much did I make in your stock options?
[179:47.43]I'm out.
[179:48.19]Oh, you made $275 million?
[179:50.33]Okay, I'm staying home and getting high and watching TV.
[179:53.89]Bye.
[179:54.15]I don't care.

[180:13.71]I don't care.

[181:06.02]This is not fair.
[181:06.88]I fold.
[181:07.18]Alright.
[181:11.00]I have a theory.
[181:13.03]And that theory is, I think you just have to play, like, three or four games before they do the next, like, murder mystery cutscene.
[181:17.97]So I'm just going to fold every... No, I'm not.
[181:19.55]That's an ace, bro.

[186:55.09]We're waiting to get the big mystery drop.
[186:57.45]It's happening soon here.
[186:59.45]Very soon.
[187:03.48]I'm going to laugh if there just is no mystery.
[187:05.60]We just keep doing these intermission cutscenes where they sit down and talk shit for 10 seconds and then go back to the game.
[187:12.07]I raise.
[187:12.95]I raise.
[187:13.75]You may fold, call, or raise.

[189:58.23]I quit.
[189:58.49]Alright, Countdown Vampires is coming up.
[190:09.28]We'll see.
[190:13.21]I have high hopes for this one.
[190:31.24]It sucked so bad.
[190:36.90]You should play a loud sound to wake everybody up that fell asleep.
[190:39.80]Um, that's a... No.
[190:42.26]That's fucked up.
[190:52.77]No, that's not nice.
[191:07.90]What was that saying?
[191:08.60]This is fiction.
[191:10.86]Don't recreate this.
[191:14.32]Like, don't be a vampire.
[191:15.76]How would you recreate this?
[191:31.85]Let's go.
[191:43.37]Input your data.
[191:44.55]This is hurting my head looking at this.
[191:45.97]I don't even care.
[191:52.13]Blood group?
[191:52.83]What's my blood type?
[191:56.19]I don't know what my blood type is.
[191:57.15]I have no idea.
[191:57.69]I'm just going to say A. I don't know.
[192:00.79]I actually don't have any idea.
[192:02.15]I said to get away from that screen.
[192:07.05]I'm a homicide detective from a neighboring state.
[192:10.78]And I've specifically come here for a very simple reason.
[192:16.50]I'm working as a guard for the VIPs at the Casino Hotel opening party.
[192:21.64]Uh-oh, connected game.
[192:24.36]It's me, Adam West.
[192:25.72]Let me just tell you something.
[192:27.12]I found this receipt on the ground.
[192:39.23]This does not fit this game.
[192:45.36]This doesn't fit the game at all.
[192:52.77]This feels like back in YouTube when something got DMCA content ID'd and a default regular ass YouTube song had to be played over the video.
[193:16.43]Okay.
[193:19.06]What's happening?
[193:55.96]Blackjack!
[193:58.06]Why are there animals in here?
[194:08.16]Why are there animals in here?
[194:09.20]Why is this cat in here?
[194:27.52]What?
[195:08.23]No, this is real.
[195:10.03]What?
[195:10.69]Why are they doing this?
[195:39.92]What the heck is going on here?
[196:05.75]Wait, does that- Is he a vampire?
[196:09.17]Who shot who?
[196:13.33]I feel like this was made in the movies.
[196:14.53]This is a movies movie game.
[196:18.97]You alright?
[196:20.59]What are they?
[196:25.65]Get out of here!
[196:28.08]They're vampires!
[196:34.18]Okay.
[196:34.63]That's good to know.
[196:38.95]Did we deal with the fire?
[196:41.47]Is this me?
[196:43.83]Why?
[196:43.97]This is the main character?
[197:01.69]Alright, that was a lot to take in.
[197:04.21]But... Leave this area within three minutes.
[197:08.09]Head for the Screaming Moon door.
[197:09.66]Use the... Anis... What?
[197:11.70]I have three minutes to get out of here.
[197:14.96]Okay.
[197:22.26]How do I move?
[197:31.65]Please leave Club Regan immediately and proceed to a safe shelter area.
[197:38.64]It's fucking Resident Evil.
[197:47.19]How do I move?
[197:58.89]slot machine can be played but not what but not what you have chosen now what there is nothing worse than tank controls nothing on this Earth how do I get out of here
[198:33.33]Get up the stairs!
[198:34.43]Oh god, okay.
[198:46.21]The security car died.
[198:47.78]Wait, is it way from the beginning?
[199:03.39]I think I made it.
[199:13.02]This white water turns them back to normal.
[199:16.80]Am I remembering what he said?
[199:24.98]Okay.
[199:28.26]Or some white water on them.
[199:29.55]What the
[199:32.61]What do you want me to do?
[199:36.63]I didn't even have a second time.
[199:49.08]Where's my menu?
[200:54.63]Fire prevention.
[200:55.57]Oh, no, I don't.
[200:56.51]Wait, it's alright.
[200:57.33]It's OK.
[200:57.53]I don't want to go.
[200:59.03]One more.
[200:59.47]Regan will be sealed off in three minutes.
[201:02.46]Okay, so I'm sorry, and I'm gonna make a lot of people really upset about this probably.
[201:06.88]You're probably gonna be like, dude, what the fuck, fuck you, right?
[201:09.28]But just let me, this is my opinion about video games.
[201:11.70]This is my personal video game opinion, and all I have to say is I don't like the old Resident Evil games.
[201:17.06]I think they're awful.
[201:18.96]And I thought that when they came out, because they came out during a period where I, that was like a new thing.
[201:24.81]Like, when the Resident Evil games were a big deal, they were just barely releasing, and I was part of that group that saw it.
[201:33.34]And I did not like them.
[201:36.70]And those are like the best of the best.
[201:40.14]In this genre of tank-controlled games, I don't think I'm gonna like this one very much at all.
[201:52.89]Resident Evil 4 does not count.
[201:54.45]I'm talking about Resident Evil 1.
[201:56.75]Resident Evil 2.
[201:58.95]Although, I did enjoy them.
[202:01.23]I did play them.
[202:02.18]I did.
[202:03.00]Eventually.
[202:04.40]But, I never was a fan of the tank controls.
[202:08.24]Okay, let me figure this out.
[202:11.34]That's a zoomer opinion?
[202:13.77]No, it's not.
[202:14.55]I just don't like tank control games.
[202:16.13]They just drive me crazy.
[202:18.62]Alright, anesthetic stun gun and after they're under, pour some white water on them and... Do I have white water?
[202:25.33]Stun globe, anesthetic dart.
[202:30.66]I don't have white... Wait, white water is in the corner.
[202:33.36]How do I use it?
[202:37.26]How do I use the... How do I use the water?
[202:56.13]What the fuck?
[202:57.15]How do I pour the water on them?
[203:05.56]That doesn't help?
[203:07.44]What?
[203:30.71]Action?
[203:33.59]Change weapon?
[203:34.47]Wait, what's that?
[203:39.17]How do you pour water on them?
[204:11.13]Okay.
[204:18.25]Ready?
[204:22.11]Are you though?
[204:41.50]Bionicle's going in, PS2.
[204:46.28]Bionicle for PS2.
[204:47.61]Going in.
[204:48.25]Now.
[204:53.39]I mean, that was worth playing just to get that opening cutscene.
[204:56.39]That was great.
[205:20.97]This looks fucking awesome.
[205:53.50]That was a very long intro.
[206:11.15]Take two?
[206:15.63]The movie's starting, everybody quiet.
[206:33.84]What are you?
[206:36.19]Are you our savior?
[206:41.21]Everything is run amuck here, see?
[206:44.63]Our island has been invaded by the six Piraka.
[206:49.17]Vicious creatures they are.
[206:52.31]But they've gotten hold of the Mask of Life.
[206:56.92]That mask has strange powers.
[207:00.90]And in the wrong hands.
[207:03.54]It's transformed all the island's inhabitants into all kinds of strange, spiteful creatures.
[207:11.96]They're everywhere.
[207:18.42]You must track down and defeat the Piraka to return Voya Nui to peace.
[207:26.36]Use the powers that the masks will grant you to save Voya Nui.
[207:33.70]This is sick.
[207:46.32]Bionicle Heroes.
[207:47.80]I'm ready.
[207:49.82]I'm prepared.
[207:54.66]It's Traveler's Tales.
[207:55.92]They make the Lego games.
[207:57.83]Really?
[207:58.41]They're still kicking, huh?
[208:07.90]That's pretty cool.
[208:10.58]Alright, I'm ready.
[208:11.94]I know a lot of people were looking forward to this.
[208:35.41]The bloom is unbelievable.
[208:40.03]The whole game is a bloom filter.
[208:44.63]Enter shop.
[208:48.04]Whoa, what is all this?
[208:49.20]Alright, I gotta go do a mission.
[209:03.15]Zone select.
[209:14.26]Dezok's coastline.
[209:18.47]I think that's the only one I can do, right?
[209:21.19]Let's go.
[209:23.74]You need 3D glasses.
[209:28.50]It really is like the Lego games, isn't it?
[209:36.62]I could turn scan lines on.
[209:38.14]It might help.
[209:51.43]Should I try it?
[209:51.87]You want me to try Scanlines?
[209:58.77]Let's see.
[210:02.11]Hold on.
[210:02.43]I don't want you to see.
[210:04.74]I'm not wearing any clothes.
[210:05.72]Alright, I'm going to try it.
[210:10.42]You tell me which one looks best.
[210:18.30]Ready?
[210:21.48]How's that look?
[210:25.74]What's that?
[210:28.71]Better?
[210:33.19]Does that look better?
[210:39.42]It's too dark?
[210:40.18]Hold on.
[210:52.71]How's that?
[211:02.96]It feels like I'm playing this game in a dream.
[211:05.14]It feels like I'm playing this game in a dream.
[211:08.36]I'm not even playing it right now.
[211:10.14]I'm dreaming that I'm playing this.
[211:11.44]2006 YouTube.
[211:14.46]Alright, I'm gonna go back.
[211:17.72]I'm gonna go back.
[211:21.34]I'm going back!
[211:22.14]Just hold on!
[211:22.82]Okay.
[211:33.51]How's that?
[211:34.93]The game just has a lot of bloom on it.
[211:40.13]It does look like I'm holding it in front of a TV.
[211:46.25]Yeah, it looks like I'm pointing a camera at the TV.
[211:56.30]Okay.
[211:56.56]Put the brightness down.
[211:58.76]How's that?
[212:02.60]I think that looks alright.
[212:03.42]That's actually not that bad.
[212:04.35]Let's go.
[212:04.67]Whoa.
[212:36.10]I have a lot of money.
[212:36.84]Is there like a dash?
[212:48.43]Whoa!
[212:49.55]I can change character?
[212:50.37]Alright, that's pretty sick.
[212:59.98]I got another character.
[213:02.76]Put Bloom on your webcam.
[213:11.68]This is a... Whoa, I think I just killed that.
[213:13.63]Cool.
[213:21.35]This game is actually really good.
[213:24.73]Put bloom on your... I don't think I know.
[213:26.27]I can't.
[213:26.67]I don't know how to do that. 5,000?
[213:50.29]Another character.
[213:50.77]What does this person do?
[213:53.82]Grenades?
[213:56.34]I could see how this would be absolutely phenomenal.
[214:03.76]Like, this is a great game.
[214:06.92]Do I have to collect them or something?
[214:08.02]Are they just worth money?
[214:16.43]Bionicle series literally saved Lego from bankruptcy.
[214:19.15]It was the Holy Grail for them.
[214:21.79]That's pretty sick.
[214:32.88]You need your green... Gust ability here?
[214:38.52]Is it Balta?
[214:40.14]I don't have this ability.
[214:42.78]So do I have to leave?
[214:56.88]Bionicles were dope.
[214:59.94]Bionicle kind of passed by me.
[215:01.74]They weren't quite my generation.
[215:03.26]It was just barely.
[215:23.36]You're very old.
[215:24.46]Yeah, kind of.
[215:33.50]So when I fill that thing up at the top, that means I've got the maximum amount of money from this level?
[215:52.24]Hero mode increases weapon power and allows you to trigger gold... ...constractions?
[215:59.39]What's that mean?
[216:04.48]What's that mean?
[216:12.55]This guy was kind of hard though.
[216:13.74]Wasn't it?
[216:42.47]What's this?
[216:43.53]Whoa!
[217:18.46]Build the boat.
[217:19.36]Are you kidding me?
[217:24.13]Holy shit, that was cool.
[217:24.91]What do I do with the boat?
[217:38.27]Is it on rails?
[217:38.97]I think it's on rails.
[218:08.22]Doesn't look that bad anymore.
[218:09.38]Looks alright.
[218:09.84]Could be worse.
[218:13.30]Whoa, hold on.
[218:15.51]Holy shit.
[218:19.83]Oh!
[218:26.73]Open this.
[218:31.37]Jeez, I'm gonna die.
[218:32.37]I'm dead.
[218:40.48]Jesus!
[218:41.04]I got the masks?
[218:58.99]Here Robbo, let's go!
[219:34.89]This game looks like the disc is rusted.
[219:41.85]It's not.
[219:45.18]The disc rusted, dude.
[219:58.09]This is just what video games looked like, like 20 years ago.
[220:08.66]It's still a boss over here.
[220:12.76]Oh no, it's a mask.
[220:13.50]Alright, good.
[220:20.25]I think I like this guy the best.
[220:21.11]I like the fire.
[220:24.03]Can I not?
[220:30.75]I don't have that ability yet.
[220:37.17]Shit.
[220:49.89]I think your screen is dirty.
[221:07.53]This game's really cool, but can we go back to Adam West?
[221:11.30]No, to go back to Adam West, we have to play seven card stud, which nobody wants to do that.
[221:19.80]or seven cards or whatever it is I had a prompt for something what was that yep this is bionicle
[221:51.24]I hit a lot of people with that.
[221:54.87]That's a lot of money you're giving me.
[222:06.71]I like the building stuff.
[222:07.62]It's fun.
[222:09.92]About to go hero mode.
[222:24.61]I need health.
[222:33.45]This is literally a cooler Lego game.
[222:35.21]I mean, it's pretty cool.
[222:39.16]I think it's fun.
[222:46.72]I need a mask.
[222:47.40]I need a mask!
[222:49.54]Stop!
[223:09.12]Dude, imagine a remade, remastered version of this game.
[223:12.07]It'd be amazing.
[223:19.11]Did they ever make one of these again?
[223:20.51]Or no?
[223:22.55]Never again.
[223:22.97]What am I doing?
[223:33.89]Oh, I can climb this.
[223:36.73]Never again.
[223:37.65]Really?
[223:37.97]That's unfortunate.
[223:57.59]That bounce?
[224:00.91]I'm going this way.
[224:06.46]Can I go down there?
[224:19.74]Gamer Andy?
[224:28.88]Where is it?
[224:30.76]Where is it?
[224:34.35]Stop!
[224:34.83]Where's the thing?
[224:39.69]Why can't I do it?
[224:40.23]Come on, do it!
[224:49.32]What the fuck?
[224:55.53]I can't do anything with this.
[225:02.03]I actually can't do anything.
[225:08.84]I can't make it.
[225:09.96]I don't have the ability.
[225:16.64]I apparently can't do anything.
[225:19.51]You wasted the hero mode.
[225:25.09]No, I got it.
[225:25.93]Oh, okay.
[225:27.07]I need new abilities.
[225:27.91]Cool.
[225:36.16]This is cool.
[225:37.24]What a cool game.
[225:38.66]Imagine getting this for Christmas.
[225:40.29]You know what I mean?
[225:40.97]You would be absolutely thrilled.
[226:00.48]So I don't have that character.
[226:01.70]I can't open this.
[226:07.93]Looks like it's behind me.
[226:10.91]Whatever.
[226:30.80]I want to go buy stuff.
[226:31.68]Look how much money I have.
[227:00.34]Hero mode?
[227:02.08]Uh oh.
[227:11.06]I need to get hero mode because of the boss.
[227:29.87]I gotta get around.
[227:33.57]I can't fight this guy.
[227:34.71]Wait, hold on.
[227:50.34]I need god mode or whatever it is.
[228:10.54]How do I activate hero mode?
[228:11.48]I don't have enough.
[228:30.63]Activated?
[228:31.03]I can't.
[228:31.79]Almost there.
[228:48.73]Oh fuck, there's a lot of people here.
[228:56.38]Oh, this is bad.
[228:57.38]Let's go!
[229:14.91]Nice job.
[229:33.28]Ow!
[229:49.72]Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die!
[230:12.86]Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
[230:54.92]No!
[230:55.36]It's alright, I have plenty.
[231:17.91]Joe Biden left Hold on
[231:56.72]I'm trying to find Joe Biden talking.
[232:00.97]What would it be under?
[232:05.13]Joe Biden, like, hanging out?
[232:10.43]I don't think that exists.
[232:25.92]Joe Biden voice lines.
[232:27.72]Yeah, but he's not like a fucking cartoon character.
[232:30.26]Like, oh, voice lines, Joe Biden.
[232:39.12]Joe Biden's super cut.
[232:58.25]I can't... I don't know what this even sounds like.
[233:03.67]Okay.
[233:05.81]This is not even going to be funny.
[233:07.33]Like, at all.
[233:07.83]I'll tell you what.
[233:09.95]Stand up or die.
[233:43.79]I told you it wasn't gonna be funny Sounds like he's part of the game
[233:57.81]He's in the game.
[234:08.18]Oh, new character.
[234:19.09]How many is a lot of characters?
[234:28.08]Alright, so now I can upgrade and unlock items.
[234:32.28]This is what I care about more than anything.
[234:36.76]I don't want to go in there.
[234:41.67]No.
[234:42.45]How do I get out of here?
[234:44.45]There we go.
[234:48.05]How much money do I actually have?
[234:49.15]That's the question.
[234:53.70]You can now visit the creature chambers.
[234:55.42]Okay.
[234:59.45]You can now visit the trophy room.
[235:06.50]Canister locator.
[235:08.64]Diving board.
[235:09.40]This is all so expensive.
[235:17.97]What?
[235:21.23]Don't show me this.
[235:22.57]This is awesome.
[235:24.65]I like the fire.

[236:40.29]A great hint.
[236:41.07]Thanks for telling me how to fire my weapon.
[236:42.67]Might as well get a ball.
[236:44.91]Okay.
[236:50.08]Okay.
[236:53.85]Collect Lego pieces to power up your hero meter.
[236:55.43]Yeah.
[236:55.55]Should have done this in the very beginning.
[236:57.54]Okay.
[237:00.20]Alright.
[237:01.34]Alright.
[237:02.74]Now I'm excited because look at this.
[237:06.17]This guy's cracked out now.
[237:28.81]I would have put a thousand hours into this game when I was like 12, without a doubt.
[237:41.97]Okay, I did that.
[237:45.62]Go to the ice level.
[237:48.80]Box Mountain.
[238:01.41]What about Sly Cooper?
[238:03.96]You'll see it eventually.
[238:04.64]I got a lot of games.
[238:11.94]Dude, you're an adult.
[238:12.68]You can put a thousand hours into this.
[238:14.62]Yeah, but I don't want to do that.
[238:25.97]Is he making somebody?
[238:26.85]Dude, you suck.
[238:42.53]Look at that upgraded torch.
[238:44.72]Oh, it just absolutely melts people.
[238:47.32]It just melts people.
[239:06.15]Why would I switch to another hero?
[239:07.23]Unless I have to move something.
[239:25.75]Shit, don't have that prison.
[239:34.39]Almost psycho.
[239:39.19]Here we go.
[239:55.58]There we go.
[240:02.68]Ooh!
[240:03.25]Can I open this?
[240:10.31]Shit!
[240:26.57]I really didn't think I was going to like this.
[240:28.13]I thought this was going to be crap.
[240:34.57]I was like, this is going to be dumb.
[240:52.94]Bionicle is based.
[240:54.64]Yeah, I know.
[241:02.45]What do you think I'm doing here?
[241:11.16]What's this?
[241:12.61]Ooh!
[241:15.39]Preacher!
[241:31.96]Build Bionicle on stream.
[241:37.99]Why am I dying?
[241:40.09]Why am I dying?
[241:43.53]Why am I... What happened?
[241:44.41]Why am I dying?
[241:48.87]What did I do?
[241:52.84]Can't be in the water?
[242:06.18]That's bad.
[242:06.88]I can't walk across water now.
[242:19.12]Take another battery.
[242:19.76]Oh, thank God.
[242:29.44]Do this for six hours.
[242:32.38]I'll do this for a little while.
[242:43.23]Yep, this is Bionicle.
[242:45.83]This is Bionicle for the PlayStation 2.
[242:47.57]Okay.
[242:55.93]Pop that.
[243:01.60]I need to collect more of this shit.
[243:02.72]I'm out of money.
[243:07.46]I need way more money.
[243:18.11]I've heard of this thing so many times.
[243:19.27]It's kind of... Nice.
[243:33.27]I don't want to turn on the hero mode yet.
[243:36.47]Not yet.
[243:43.40]Ooh, what's this?
[243:47.10]Beat this game or watch the Bionicle movies.
[243:49.04]It's your choice.
[243:51.90]Well, one of those things is illegal.
[243:54.06]So I think I'll choose this for a little while.
[243:55.72]Do both?
[244:04.57]Alright, I got hero mode.
[244:15.79]It's illegal.
[244:29.41]Alright, where's the big guy?
[244:32.63]Come on!
[244:33.13]Where is he?
[244:33.47]Do it!
[244:41.31]There's been a towel wreck.
[245:15.46]Come on, where's the... How do I make the big guy?
[245:37.75]There we go, there it is.
[245:52.68]A lot of people.
[246:05.55]Do it.
[246:06.05]Climb.
[246:10.45]Cool.
[246:23.80]It's worth a lot.
[246:28.92]The Lego games do this too.
[246:32.24]You'd have to touch everything.
[246:42.87]A Bionicle's cool.
[246:48.47]Would you guys all leave a Bionicle stream if I made one?
[246:53.74]I've never... I've done... I've never even played with him.
[246:55.56]Ever.
[246:56.02]I've never even seen him before.
[247:08.75]I would leave.
[247:09.43]Okay.
[247:31.57]One more money.
[247:35.95]Nice.
[247:39.19]It's so satisfying.
[247:42.45]This game is great.
[247:44.27]I like it a lot.
[247:45.67]It's really cool.
[247:58.42]Do a pull, pull, pull.
[247:59.93]Pull for what?
[248:02.47]To keep playing this?
[248:09.31]Oh, to make a Bionicle.
[248:10.61]Alright, should I make a Bionicle like next week?
[248:14.49]On stream.
[248:17.31]It has to be at least 80%.
[248:48.97]Gotta be a lot.
[248:49.41]40,000.
[248:49.43]Shit, I want that.
[249:19.84]Did I get turned around?
[249:20.68]Oh my god.
[249:34.29]Okay.
[249:35.03]Jeez.
[249:37.54]You guys like Bionicle?
[249:45.14]I don't have it.
[249:48.68]You look like a Bionicle.
[249:49.89]That's incredibly handsome.
[249:54.99]I didn't see them.
[249:56.53]Come on.
[250:08.28]How do I get across?
[250:25.66]Money.
[250:27.15]Money!
[250:35.07]Keep going.
[250:38.17]Cool.
[250:44.17]Ooh, what's in here?
[250:47.89]Will you eat the Bionicle?
[250:50.12]No.
[250:51.20]I will display it on my Reddit shelf.
[251:16.01]What is this?
[251:20.02]Oh, alright.
[251:27.16]I'm kind of just like vibing out right now.
[251:29.88]This is fun.

[254:45.98]Okay, get up.
[254:46.58]I gotta sit up.
[255:15.34]Get this fucking shield off!

[257:24.19]I got one gold canister.
[257:30.19]And I got a rock.
[257:36.37]Ooh, what else did I get?
[257:37.19]Alright, upgrade.
[257:55.03]Wait, it's a permanent 50% discount permanently?
[257:57.59]Should I wait for that?
[258:11.09]Why would you wait for that?
[258:11.83]Because it's 50% off everything.
[258:27.72]Maximum damage.
[258:40.15]You gonna play more games tonight?
[258:41.23]Yeah.
[258:51.18]You upgraded his ability, not his gun.
[258:56.16]Isn't that the torch?
[258:57.84]No?
[259:00.02]Is it the launcher?
[259:14.71]I think it's upgraded.
[259:15.69]Yeah, look, this is maximum.
[259:19.11]Look, see?
[259:19.47]Alright, how about this?
[259:25.94]one more level let's let's take a break it's been four and a half hours no break take a break go pee come back one more level and then we'll play something else this is very good though I'm very happy with this one only four percent game progress how long is this game wow alright I'll be right back go pee grab a snack or something back in like two minutes
[263:49.42]okay these things are so good I could eat these until I puked I really could these pretzel rods these things
[264:23.24]I could eat these until I threw up.
[264:34.71]It's gotta be the rods, though.
[264:41.99]You know what I mean?
[264:42.49]You need to get 100% progress?
[264:43.35]That's not gonna happen tonight.
[264:48.63]Honey mustard.
[264:50.71]A lot of people are going to think I'm gross for this.
[264:52.98]But I really do mean this.
[264:53.90]I think I've probably talked about this before.
[264:57.58]But... Trust me.
[265:02.14]You DansGame and I didn't even say anything.
[265:03.94]You see?
[265:09.39]Ready?
[265:12.41]Pretzel rods.
[265:13.81]I didn't even say... I didn't even say anything yet.
[265:20.63]You make tuna fish, you know, like as if you were going to make a tuna fish sandwich.
[265:25.51]Lose the bread.
[265:27.09]Bowl of tuna fish, you know, with the mayo, like as if you're going to put it in a sandwich.
[265:31.81]Don't even get the bread out of the container.
[265:35.14]Pretzel rods, tuna fish, dip, bite, get a good amount, good paste of the tuna on there.
[265:41.06]I just stabbed myself in the fucking lip and I'm pissed at all of you.
[265:51.44]It's so good.
[265:57.04]It is so good.
[266:15.95]No spices, just tuna.
[266:16.87]Mayo.
[266:17.73]Mayo.
[266:22.03]So don't act like you don't do that when you have a pretzel rod.
[266:26.43]You don't, like, squish it up here and, like, squish it back here and put it down here and over here.
[266:30.29]Here you go.
[266:31.47]Alright, let's get back to it.
[266:34.51]My heart.
[266:38.65]Tuna is cat food.
[266:43.07]I burnt my screen in.
[266:44.09]I burnt my screen in.
[266:44.92]I burnt my screen in.
[266:45.66]I burnt my screen in.
[266:48.26]I burnt my screen in!
[266:51.00]My screen's ruined.
[266:52.54]You can't see this.
[266:53.32]My screen is burnt in.
[266:56.76]What?
[266:58.58]No, no.
[266:59.43]This is really bad.
[267:00.83]This is really bad.
[267:01.75]Hold on.
[267:08.23]What the fuck?
[267:17.29]Why is it burnt in?
[267:21.51]Hold on, I gotta take a picture of this.
[267:22.43]You have to see this.
[267:32.08]It's burnt into the capture card?
[267:33.50]I have no idea.
[267:40.24]Yeah, this is not going away.
[267:49.48]It's okay.
[267:50.46]I gotta get this into Discord.
[267:54.58]You can make out the letters.
[267:57.46]It says like reset start.
[268:00.16]Oh my God.
[268:03.70]Let me just see what happened.
[268:04.94]Yeah.
[268:05.20]Cause when I was paused here, it says, yeah, resume it's burnt into the capture card.
[268:10.66]Hold on.
[268:14.75]This is so stupid.
[268:16.95]You can see resume options and quit.
[268:21.02]Hold on.
[268:21.42]Let me get this so I can put it on the stream.
[268:34.73]Hold on.
[268:38.37]Okay.
[268:43.80]Okay.
[268:44.68]Got it.
[268:45.60]Alright.
[268:51.39]So this is what I see right now.
[268:54.69]And I'm going to have to probably restart everything.
[269:12.43]So let me know when you can see it.
[269:21.67]You see that?
[269:29.92]This sucks.
[269:32.20]I have to restart the capture card, probably.
[269:34.90]But that's what I see.
[269:35.68]Why?
[269:44.87]Resume options and quit.
[269:46.63]And then game progress is right there.
[269:50.85]You're making it worse?
[269:56.31]Can you guys make it out?
[270:00.10]That says resume.
[270:05.76]I am... I'm flabbergasted right now.
[270:08.52]I don't know what to do.
[270:12.97]Uh... What do I... What should I do about this?
[270:16.01]This is unbearable.
[270:20.64]It's your screen, not your card.
[270:24.48]Hold on.
[270:25.02]This is... Fuck!
[270:26.96]My screen!
[270:28.40]Hold on a second.
[270:29.78]I'm going to laugh my ass off if I switch to my actual monitor.
[270:33.99]And is it still there?
[270:34.73]Oh, thank God it's not.
[270:37.37]Okay.
[270:38.37]Wait a minute.
[270:38.79]Is it?
[270:41.69]It actually might still be here.
[270:45.75]No, it can't.
[270:46.46]No, no, no.
[270:47.00]I'm seeing things.
[270:49.12]It's burnt into my capture card.
[270:52.37]Um, why would you not be seeing it though?
[270:57.74]Hold on.
[271:01.20]Fuck, it's still there.
[271:02.30]Hold on.
[271:10.65]I didn't save the game!
[271:11.55]I didn't save the game!
[271:12.23]I didn't save the game!
[271:13.33]I'm so fucking annoyed right now.
[271:15.27]I didn't save the game, did I?
[271:19.67]It's still there.
[271:23.64]No!
[271:25.99]It's on the actual... Oh, no.
[271:28.85]It's over.
[271:35.73]Reset your monitor?
[271:38.08]Hold on.
[271:38.42]Let me see if it's still here.
[271:45.84]Yeah, it's burnt into the fucking capture card.
[271:53.87]Take another picture.
[271:55.12]You guys need to see it.
[272:03.94]It's so stupid.
[272:05.22]I wonder if I can fix it somehow.
[272:21.13]No, it's not the screen because I just changed over to my different... I changed over to my other input.
[272:30.67]Let me reset the card.
[272:31.55]It's definitely still there.
[272:42.90]God damn it.
[272:43.74]Give me a second.
[272:48.01]Show us again.
[272:48.55]Hold on.
[272:52.21]I wasn't even gone for that long.
[272:56.78]Honestly, I was only gone for like five minutes.
[272:59.10]Not even.
[272:59.50]Two minutes.
[273:04.14]Here, look.
[273:05.05]Here's the other one.
[273:05.57]Just to prove that it's a different screenshot.
[273:13.89]If I could get it on there, that'd be great.
[273:24.36]Here's the next one.
[273:29.06]This one, you can see it a lot better.
[273:30.16]Here.
[273:33.48]Reset your monitor.
[273:34.38]It's image retention.
[273:35.32]Interlacing makes that happen sometimes.
[273:36.86]Power cycle you monitor, it's 100% not burning, okay?
[273:39.46]So you're saying I should not be concerned about like this, for instance, right?
[274:00.32]Like I shouldn't be concerned about this.
[274:01.64]I'm going to reset the monitor and see if that fixes it.
[274:17.93]Okay.
[274:22.25]Resetting it.
[274:30.18]Going back.
[274:32.74]And... It's still kind of there.
[274:44.41]Wait.
[274:46.47]I think it's better.
[274:51.76]The more you play, the quicker it will go away.
[274:55.59]I feel like it's very faintly there still.
[274:57.27]Alright, we're good.
[274:57.78]Let's just go.
[274:59.22]Alright, well, sorry about that.
[275:00.06]That was weird.
[275:00.50]Time to replace the monitor.
[275:09.35]No, I'm good.
[275:10.53]I'm good.
[275:14.75]It would have been funnier if your face was burned in.
[275:24.43]You have nine more days to play Smite and get the 10 year anniversary rewards.
[275:27.64]I don't know what.
[275:28.92]What are you talking about?
[275:36.62]It's still there.
[275:41.92]I'm just going to play and see if it fixes itself.
[275:44.52]I reset the monitor.
[275:45.52]I'm just going to play.
[275:49.92]That's very, very annoying.
[275:57.42]Where's the last place I was?
[275:58.30]Here?
[276:03.34]No.
[276:05.20]What opened up?
[276:05.70]Nothing?
[276:09.02]Oh, okay.
[276:09.48]Power cycle not reset.
[276:15.18]Are you serious?
[276:21.34]Hold on.
[276:24.72]Like, unplug it?
[276:51.06]Which one of these is the power cable?
[276:52.78]Oh my god, don't spill!
[276:53.74]Alright, the monitor is unplugged.
[277:01.54]Oh shit, what just happened?
[277:06.25]With my stream.
[277:07.65]Alright, I'm good.
[277:09.86]Alright, coming back.
[277:16.30]Come on.
[277:18.18]Does everything have to be on the bottom of your fucking screen?
[277:25.69]I would pay extra.
[277:28.77]Dude, I would pay extra to be able to have them on the top.
[277:31.43]It's still there.
[277:36.67]Yep, still there.
[277:38.71]I just unplugged it and plugged it back in.
[277:39.95]It's there.
[277:40.37]I think it might be there forever.
[277:45.41]This is actually that kind of sucks.
[277:54.89]I'll just have to deal with it.
[277:59.71]Yeah, I can still see resume on my screen.
[278:09.30]Well, the Pretzel Raw is worth it.
[278:10.66]What is that sound?
[278:12.58]What is that sound?
[278:34.30]What's- why do I hear like rushing water?
[278:49.90]you guys don't hear this you don't hold on can you hear this
[279:17.54]Can you guys hear that?
[279:21.92]It's so loud.
[279:23.24]What's happening to my fucking computer?
[279:24.99]This is a disaster.
[279:28.45]Because I got up to piss with my mouse.
[279:43.15]Everything is backwards because I unplugged the monitor and it automatically corrected it to put the monitors in the wrong place.
[279:53.82]You guys cannot fucking hear this.
[279:55.44]I don't know how you can't.
[280:11.17]Can you guys hear the rushing water?
[280:22.85]I'm trying to make it so you can hear some cables unplugged or something.
[280:25.45]I don't know how.
[280:34.90]What is going on right now?
[280:47.37]Huh?
[281:02.88]What just happened?
[281:05.06]Hello?
[281:05.34]Can anybody hear me?
[281:10.96]I have no more control over OBS.
[281:17.95]Am I even on camera?
[281:22.19]This has been an insane last 15 minutes.
[281:27.38]I can't even see my other monitor.
[281:45.70]Alright, well, let's just go.
[281:46.84]I don't have another monitor.
[281:51.85]It's gone.
[281:53.77]I burnt this one in.
[281:54.84]This one doesn't work.
[282:23.15]Yeah, so why did that happen?
[282:25.87]Why would I have a bad burn-in for five minutes?
[282:28.90]It wasn't even five minutes.
[282:30.82]Doesn't it take, like, hours or days to burn into your fucking screen?
[282:40.22]And then all I heard was, like, through my headphones.
[283:27.93]Alright, gotta get in there.
[283:31.09]This thing does a lot of damage now.
[283:32.71]Let's go.
[283:52.10]What did that do?
[283:55.09]Ooh.
[283:55.17]Ooh.
[284:01.47]Underground.
[284:06.20]He's so into it.
[284:07.06]I kind of am.
[284:12.28]It's just fun to shoot stuff.
[284:14.71]And collect everything.
[284:15.43]It's fun.
[284:17.73]We'll move on after this level though.
[284:18.81]There's a bunch more stuff I want to do tonight.
[284:38.39]We're going to go long?
[284:39.93]Probably, yeah.
[284:55.09]24 hour stream?
[284:55.89]No, not that long, but we'll go longer than like five for sure.
[285:21.38]We're going to do a new longest stream ever?
[285:23.24]I doubt that.
[285:26.06]I would say no.
[285:38.49]I don't know.
[285:38.89]I could be wrong.
[285:39.83]I could be wrong.
[285:41.57]I doubt it, but I could be wrong.
[285:45.71]I'm going to say I'm shooting for like... I don't know.
[285:50.82]I don't have a time limit.
[285:51.48]It's until I'm done.
[286:08.98]Ooh.
[286:09.14]Oh, I don't have that character.
[286:24.16]Balfondler wants you to play WoW.
[286:26.18]I'm pretty sure Balfondler has a bot that just writes in this channel every like three days telling me to play World of Warcraft.
[286:41.43]I would not be surprised.
[286:52.89]Nice.
[287:00.78]I would definitely stay tuned though because coming up right after this.
[287:03.36]I don't know.
[287:07.41]Should I see what your reaction is?
[287:08.65]I feel like people are going to be very upset or very happy.
[287:21.22]Uh, can I not get over this?
[287:25.24]Apparently not.
[287:37.00]I love the music.
[287:37.74]It's great.
[287:44.39]The music I honestly is what's keeping me here.
[288:03.19]loom in that room.
[288:04.02]Alright, don't I have this ability though?
[288:14.00]See, it's like, oh, be this character.
[288:19.25]I am this character.
[288:20.17]How do I do that move?
[288:31.10]Burn it.
[288:39.27]It was a prompt.
[288:47.75]OK.
[288:53.66]Triangle triangle switch character.
[289:06.27]It wants me to be this character, but then it doesn't really tell me what to do after that.
[289:10.60]Oh, it just lets you cross the lava.
[289:12.60]Okay.
[289:43.60]Did you get a snack from the gas station?
[289:47.18]Yeah.
[289:49.04]Why not?
[289:56.10]Yeah.
[289:58.48]Go get a snack.
[290:03.42]You know what's actually pretty good?
[290:04.40]I hate Pepsi.
[290:06.08]But the... That Nitro Pepsi is actually... Like, at least... At least an 8 or a 9 out of 10.
[290:18.01]Nitro Pepsi is actually pretty good.
[290:27.81]I can only really drink one of those every so often.
[290:31.18]I feel like they're so much sweeter.
[290:33.46]They're really good.
[290:38.24]I don't believe that's real.
[290:39.16]No, it is.
[290:39.72]Check it out.
[290:40.46]It's good.
[290:54.48]milk Pepsi no no no nitro Pepsi it's good it's pilk you know I've actually heard that term before I've never tried it but it probably that honestly doesn't even sound that bad
[291:25.48]People do ice cream floats and stuff.
[291:27.38]Isn't that just kind of a float without it being frozen?
[291:31.56]Kind of.
[291:38.51]Basically, yeah.
[291:44.37]Alright, let me in.
[291:46.83]What's the holdup?
[291:47.92]Let me in!
[291:57.98]Ride on stream?
[292:00.61]Um... I have Coke.
[292:07.55]Will Coke and milk work?
[292:15.38]Um... Oh, uh-oh.
[292:26.38]I can't build anything with that?
[292:31.29]There we go.
[292:34.31]Falcon.
[292:34.71]Alright, lost time.
[292:38.80]Don't fuck it up.
[292:39.30]I need to generate some more.
[293:04.43]Drink drink.
[293:06.50]Silk now.
[293:09.94]Will do that later.
[293:18.83]Now no, I'm doing later.
[293:28.55]I have a Cherry Coke here, and it's not going to work with that.
[293:30.45]I don't want to ruin my Cherry Coke.
[293:33.55]Cherry Coke is S tier, and I'm not going to ruin it with, like, your, like, pilk fantasy.
[293:55.95]Ow.
[294:02.79]Come on, do it already.
[294:03.81]Oh my god.
[294:19.20]Alright, do it!
[294:22.65]Oh my god, do it already.
[294:25.13]You're killing me.
[294:35.78]Can you just kill it?
[294:43.74]Shoot!
[294:50.17]How come I'm gambling in front of my young audience?
[294:53.01]My impressionable audience?
[294:54.13]Dude, I'm playing Bionicle right now.
[295:14.35]Get that shield down, please.
[295:31.66]That chatter is on a 70 minute delay.
[295:39.65]Wait, you're telling me it's the Adam West game?
[295:41.51]Oh.
[295:50.22]Alright, put the fucking shield down before everybody dies here.
[296:04.04]Whatever.
[296:04.82]I'm good.

[296:31.17]Bounced off of his head excuse me We still have okay, I was gonna say what the fuck oh
[297:03.07]Imagine if that was Pilk.
[297:06.44]Cherry Coke is so much better than everything else.
[297:10.74]I used to be a huge 7-Up fan.
[297:12.38]But then Cherry Coke really took it over.
[297:17.87]I don't have it that often.
[297:22.15]Sometimes.
[297:23.45]When I'm just chilling out.
[297:25.59]What about your shirt?
[297:27.80]I...
[297:29.45]I can't enjoy other soda brands.
[297:30.99]I have to just do the one meme that I did like 10 years ago on my YouTube channel.
[297:46.80]Who's your favorite Bionicle?
[297:48.42]The fire one.
[297:52.52]This game was actually awesome.
[297:55.12]This was fantastic.
[297:57.25]I really wish my OBS in my monitor over here wasn't so messed up because I can't really tell.
[298:01.62]I can't really click on anything.
[298:04.46]I'm afraid to click on too much because I feel like I'll accidentally turn the stream off or something.
[298:15.22]Hold on, wait.
[298:16.82]You guys aren't getting that.
[298:17.74]No, you're not.
[298:18.12]Okay.
[298:18.26]Alright.
[298:19.30]Let's keep going.
[298:25.01]That was Bionicle and it was really fun, but we're going to move on.
[298:33.86]I wonder how people are going to like this one.
[298:36.02]Save the game.
[298:36.62]I think it was it saved, didn't it?
[298:41.76]Are you kidding me?
[298:52.80]That looks so much better.
[298:56.99]That looks a thousand times better for me.
[299:02.60]That's alright.
[299:04.42]Um... Eh, it's fine.
[299:10.00]I think it's still... I think it saved.
[299:12.62]Didn't it?
[299:12.88]Let's find out.
[299:17.21]Yeah.
[299:18.11]We got it.
[299:20.03]We're good.
[299:21.21]Okay, give me another minute.
[299:22.47]I'm just gonna put in the next game, and I want a poll to be ran immediately.
[299:28.73]I want a poll to go up immediately.
[299:31.63]The second that you get to the splash screen of this game.
[299:34.32]And I want it to be at least 50% yes.
[299:37.04]Like, yes, play this.
[299:38.46]If it's not at least 50%, I'll take it out immediately.
[299:40.00]I will take it out.
[299:48.75]You can't know what it is until it goes in.
[299:50.93]Okay.
[300:04.02]Get ready to run it.
[300:05.26]This is just a simple yes or no.
[300:07.65]Do you want me to play this game for 20 to 30 minutes?
[300:10.69]It's just a yes or no question.
[300:13.67]Alright, so let's get ready.
[300:29.92]THQ, alright.

[301:51.76]I didn't have this memory of this show being this cool.
[301:54.04]It's Claymation.
[301:56.61]I didn't know that.
[301:57.23]I thought it was just animated.
[302:01.61]Damn, that's a pretty cool show.

[310:17.70]Done.
[310:36.73]What's the world record on this game?
[310:41.96]Can somebody look it up?
[310:50.38]I think I could beat this game.
[310:51.67]I think I could be the world record holder of this game.
[311:00.35]I think I could do it.
[311:03.04]I'm literally begging you to tell me what, did you say what a Muppet is?

[311:23.64]Nine minutes, 15 seconds.
[311:27.16]Okay, so how do I do this?
[311:29.26]Is it on hard or is it on easy?
[311:30.44]What is it on?
[311:49.96]Why is that happening?
[312:23.94]I'm pressing X. That's me doing that.
[312:36.33]It's on easy.
[312:36.87]Okay.
[312:37.17]Nine minutes.
[312:39.53]So from what point?
[312:46.89]I think I could do this in nine minutes.
[312:48.39]The whole thing.
[312:50.96]Spuds on the job!
[312:52.96]Oh, look!
[312:53.94]A nice, yummy apple.
[312:56.45]All missions easy, nine minutes.
[313:01.63]How do I get a timer?
[313:02.27]I don't have that set up.
[313:13.09]Back.
[313:15.14]I'm gonna do an eight.
[313:17.02]I need time splits and shit.
[313:19.54]Back.
[313:24.38]I need live split.
[313:26.14]That's too much work.
[313:28.16]How about this?
[313:34.61]Have a mod time it.
[313:36.89]Okay, somebody time it.
[313:38.19]Can somebody time it for me?
[313:42.95]Somebody time it for me.
[313:43.59]Okay, Travis's race day.
[313:47.61]I'm ready.
[313:49.75]Use the timer built into Windows.
[313:51.03]Is there a timer?
[313:54.14]There's a clock app?
[313:56.78]Is there?
[313:57.16]Holy shit, there's a clock app.
[313:58.32]Alright, I'll try it.
[314:00.16]I think I can do it.
[314:00.72]Timer.
[314:03.96]Okay, I gotta capture this window.
[314:13.49]I need it to be... I need it to be counting, right?
[314:19.19]Okay.
[314:22.61]Alright, I'm going for it.
[314:36.36]Uh, why can I not?
[314:45.29]My OBS is so fucked up right now because of the, uh, like the glitch that happened earlier.
[314:49.69]Yeah, this is messed up.
[314:53.21]There we go.
[314:53.75]Okay.
[314:56.11]Uh, timer.
[315:04.43]Can I not capture that?
[315:05.61]That's annoying.
[315:07.87]Why can I not capture this window?
[315:10.23]In window capture.
[315:14.06]Okay.
[315:14.44]Oh, that's stupid.
[315:17.38]Never mind.
[315:20.06]Um.
[315:21.34]There's a dev in chat.
[315:23.04]That would be shocking to me.
[315:26.45]Why can I capture this?
[315:38.70]I can capture every single window, but I can't capture the clock app.
[315:42.10]Google Stopwatch instead.
[315:43.66]What the fuck?
[315:45.04]What a joke.
[315:45.96]Okay, how about Google Stopwatch?
[315:57.99]Okay.
[316:01.23]Let's try that.
[316:15.27]Okay.
[316:15.49]Alright.
[316:17.89]I'm ready.
[316:19.37]Almost.
[316:29.90]Stop this nonsense.
[316:34.32]Stop this nonsense at once.
[316:39.05]Okay.
[316:39.69]Can you see it?
[316:50.61]What's the record?
[316:51.25]Okay, here we go.
[317:01.88]Ready?
[317:02.08]Okay.
[317:11.63]Even if I don't get the world record, I'll be in the cat- I'll be literally somewhere in- I'll be in the top five.
[317:17.07]Starts when you select the first mission.
[317:18.71]Okay, here we go.
[317:19.39]Ready?
[317:29.67]Travis's race day.
[317:31.42]Easy.
[317:42.76]On your marks, get set, go!
[317:47.77]Scoot past Travis.
[318:00.73]Watch out, Scoop!
[318:03.52]Watch out, Scoop!
[318:33.08]You almost lost?
[318:33.72]No, I didn't.
[319:03.32]On your marks, get set, go!
[319:08.09]Dizzy past Travis!
[319:18.14]Watch out, Dizzy!
[319:19.16]Fuck you, Gabe!
[319:23.62]This takes two minutes, three minutes to do this one section!
[319:30.61]Watch out, Dizzy!
[319:34.22]I'm probably one of ten people on Earth that have even tracked how much time this takes to do.
[319:39.96]I'm not going to get the world record, but I'll be in the top five because I'm going to be one of five people that recorded it.
[320:00.37]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[320:02.37]Good job, Dizzy.
[320:07.09]I've never seen this before.
[320:34.24]I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[320:36.00]What do I even do?
[320:37.34]Yes, it does, Bob.
[320:39.34]Use your eyes.
[320:51.54]Yes, it does, Bob.
[321:02.42]Yes, it does.
[321:03.06]Where else does it go, Bob?
[321:30.87]Oops, this doesn't fit here.
[321:33.19]Oops, this doesn't fit here.
[321:36.10]Oops, this doesn't fit here.
[321:39.58]Wait, there's other rooms?
[321:44.88]Oops, this doesn't fit here.
[321:46.85]Why?
[321:47.31]Bob, where are you going?
[321:48.51]How many more?
[321:49.45]Oh my.
[321:51.77]Sorry, that was a bad split.
[321:52.95]That was a bad split.
[321:53.53]We can make up the time.
[321:54.13]Whatever.
[322:13.04]Nah, fuck that.
[322:13.60]I'm doing it again.
[322:15.44]Nah, fuck that.
[322:25.63]And let's go.
[322:26.79]Wait, refund?
[322:27.43]What do you mean?
[322:40.02]on your marks don't loading screens not count scoop has travis lap two watch out scoop
[323:18.93]I can do this better.
[323:36.18]I can do this better.
[323:42.40]Scoop is the winner!
[323:56.41]Was this on easy?
[323:57.01]Was that on easy?
[324:03.20]Gold split?
[324:03.96]This makes me kind of want to do that.
[324:06.58]Is that weird that I want to do this now?
[324:22.78]Lap 2!
[324:29.74]Haha!
[324:39.97]Lap 3!
[324:40.39]Haha!
[324:46.17]Watch out, Dizzy!
[324:57.93]Okay, don't fuck it up.
[325:00.15]Okay.
[325:00.35]Go.
[325:04.07]GO!
[325:39.42]Gotta get good RNG here.
[325:43.02]Ah, it's already... Already fucked up.
[325:47.92]Wicked bad RNG. ...
[326:10.37]Come on, really?
[326:11.29]Dude, you spliced this run.
[326:19.38]It's so obvious.
[326:24.09]Fuck up.
[326:33.11]You spliced this run.
[327:03.48]Easy.
[327:04.64]Am I sure that wasn't on hard?
[327:40.06]Great.
[327:40.80]Perfect fucking seed.
[327:42.19]Perfect seed.
[327:52.95]Can we build?
[327:53.96]Easy.
[328:15.07]Good job, Lofty.
[328:15.71]It's moving on its own.
[328:16.57]On easy.
[328:17.99]That's what fucked me up.
[328:23.43]Great.
[328:24.29]Good job, Lofty.
[328:32.50]Good job, Lofty.
[328:40.44]Great.
[328:40.94]Good job, Lofty.
[328:41.94]Let's build a new bridge.
[328:59.16]Such good RNG.
[328:59.86]Are you kidding me?
[329:01.69]Look at the placement.
[329:04.29]Great.
[329:05.13]Can you get the next section now?
[329:08.02]Yes.
[329:08.78]Good work.
[329:08.98]We can build it.
[329:27.45]Where can she be?
[329:56.40]That's it, Loppy.
[330:04.03]Great.
[330:04.81]Good job.
[330:09.21]Where you going?
[330:10.03]Great.
[330:20.19]Good job.
[330:22.37]That was shitty RNG, it was.
[330:32.62]Scary spot.
[330:36.61]Easy.
[331:42.17]Time.
[331:42.45]What do I got for time?
[331:45.47]Is that over?
[331:46.57]There's one more.
[331:50.81]Spuds on the job.
[332:13.05]Go!
[332:13.45]Come on!
[332:13.75]Where's this cat?
[332:15.69]When's time?
[332:18.74]When's time?
[332:19.16]When's time?
[332:19.66]When's time?
[332:21.86]When is time?
[332:22.46]Did I do it?
[332:28.10]Did I do it?
[332:28.48]Is that it?
[332:31.38]Oh, no.
[332:31.88]We got... There's so much shit to do.
[332:34.08]Wendy's birthday?
[332:42.89]What?
[332:44.49]We're going to have a birthday party.
[332:46.37]How would you do all the loading screens?
[332:48.15]How would you do this in nine minutes?
[332:50.99]What?
[332:52.25]What?
[333:04.41]Wait, is this count technically?
[333:09.57]Why is it TNT?
[333:15.66]Dude, I don't think this counts Is this part of the run?
[333:18.07]I don't know if this counts for the run
[334:01.32]This is definitely no way this is part of the run.
[334:04.30]No, this is no way.
[334:07.10]This is definitely not part of the run.
[334:15.20]It's included in the world record.
[334:17.02]What?
[334:17.88]How would you watch the world record run?
[334:48.98]I'm almost there.
[335:04.97]This is the last two minigames.
[335:06.01]That's it.
[335:06.29]Time!
[335:19.19]1249?
[335:22.71]Top 10?
[335:34.36]YO!
[335:36.26]I can do better than that.
[335:37.41]I can do better than that.
[335:39.47]I'm doing it again.
[335:40.25]I'm gonna get sub 12.
[335:42.47]Why do I care?
[335:47.68]I told you nobody runs this.
[335:50.80]I'm going top.
[335:51.58]I'm going.
[335:51.96]Alright, here we go.
[335:53.54]Watch the world record first.
[336:06.72]Nah.
[336:10.61]Here we go.
[336:11.11]Ready?
[336:13.51]Travis's race day.
[336:15.81]Is it on easy?
[336:19.42]Is it on easy by default?
[336:25.89]I'm going to try as hard as I can to get sub 12.
[336:31.35]Because I don't want any of you dicks to overtake my top 10 record.
[336:40.38]Because you just have to play.
[336:41.72]Just reset.
[336:42.58]Reset.
[336:42.94]Reset.
[336:43.60]That was a bad one.
[336:45.89]I know one of you guys is gonna get this.
[336:48.48]And you're gonna bump me on purpose.
[336:53.72]Alright, no more fucking around.
[337:07.67]I'm going for it for real.
[337:09.23]I'm going sub 12.
[337:09.83]Let's go.
[337:10.69]Go!
[337:11.96]On your marks, get set, go!
[337:16.80]Scoop has Travis.
[337:20.31]I got reset.
[337:27.73]Ha-ha!
[337:32.72]Lap two.
[337:33.98]They're neck and neck.
[337:35.60]Watch out, Scoop.
[337:49.87]Lap 3.
[337:52.81]Watch out, Scoop!
[338:10.74]Nah.
[338:12.70]E-hell ba- Travis is right.
[338:17.90]Easy.
[338:23.14]No more resets.
[338:23.74]I'm going.
[338:25.96]No more resets.
[338:28.49]No, I don't... This is a glitchless speedrun.
[338:34.45]Glitchless any% speedrun.
[338:37.41]All minigames.
[338:38.01]I want to reset so bad.
[338:45.76]I have to reset one more time.
[338:47.46]I swear to God I'm not going to do it again.
[338:51.75]Hold on.
[338:53.23]This is a glitchless any% speedrun.
[338:57.05]I promise I'm not going to reset ever again.
[338:58.85]One, two, three, go.
[339:02.23]I promise.
[339:05.12]Last one, for real.
[339:12.04]On your marks, get set, go!
[339:17.23]Scoot past Travis.
[339:18.73]Watch out, Scoot.
[339:32.26]Lap two!
[339:35.24]Watch out, Scoop!
[339:39.30]Haha!
[339:49.75]Lap three!
[339:53.25]Haha!
[339:55.95]Watch out, Scoop!
[340:02.91]I'm not going to restart.
[340:13.29]No, I'm going.
[340:14.99]I'm not resetting.
[340:29.57]I just need sub 12 and I'll move on, I promise.
[340:31.03]Sub 12, I swear to God.
[340:32.57]Ha ha!
[341:08.67]That was shit placement and you all know it.
[341:28.88]Alright, that's the worst part of the whole run.
[341:37.98]That's the shittiest part of the run.
[341:56.03]Can I move faster here?
[341:58.13]Crow is the worst one.
[342:01.91]That was clean.
[342:28.27]Clean.
[342:28.53]Good timing.
[342:32.56]Ink is bad.
[342:33.14]Bad RNG.
[342:38.86]I think it gets up 12.
[342:42.88]Just can't mess up the crow part.
[342:57.16]It's not there.
[342:57.66]Don't be fooled.
[342:59.16]Lots of other runners get fooled by that.
[343:17.70]I don't think I could do this one any better if I wanted to.
[343:48.94]Godlike RNG.
[343:55.43]Absolutely godlike RNG.
[343:57.59]Holy shit.
[343:59.03]Pray for that kind of fucking RNG.
[344:10.92]Can we build...
[344:31.85]come on, keep going, keep going, keep going
[345:14.23]Do it!
[345:16.21]Great!
[345:17.03]Can you get the next section now?
[345:18.39]Yes!
[345:20.59]Good work!
[345:22.09]We can build it!
[345:23.91]Where can she be?
[345:41.85]Good.
[345:42.98]I'm definitely going to get sub 12.
[345:44.30]No doubt.
[345:51.74]Porcupine rest.
[345:55.66]Oh, Bob.
[345:59.03]This one's really, really tricky.
[346:00.51]If you don't get a good RNG, then I'm just going to stop saying that word because I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
[346:05.23]That's it, Lofty.
[346:12.57]I couldn't press it.
[346:13.17]I couldn't press it.
[346:13.61]It wouldn't let me.
[346:16.39]That wasn't a joke.
[346:45.49]Definitely way better than last time.
[346:59.89]Scary.
[347:01.83]Making sure it's on easy.
[347:02.67]This one sucks.
[347:07.20]This is going to make or break the whole run.
[347:41.48]Get out!
[347:42.42]What?!
[347:59.13]Get the fuck out of here!
[348:00.35]Alright, that was... They got a land?!
[348:04.17]No!
[348:04.90]You want them not to land so they eat your crops!
[348:09.52]I'm fine.
[348:10.95]Spuds on the job.
[348:22.64]Where can she be?
[348:23.76]Okay, there's not much left.
[348:29.47]We have dance party.
[348:30.41]We have... What's left?
[348:35.41]Wendy's birthday.
[348:36.89]Okay, here we go.
[348:46.08]Do I need to use all the ingredients?
[348:48.87]Do I have to use all the ingredients?
[348:51.33]No, I don't.
[348:51.91]Okay, alright, good, good, good.
[349:16.94]This is it.
[349:30.13]This is it, coming up.
[349:34.22]He's doing the Kubrick stare.
[349:37.16]Is it time after this?
[349:39.54]Is that it?
[349:41.94]What about your time?
[349:42.82]Time?
[349:43.14]When?
[349:47.20]Time!
[349:51.28]Right?
[349:52.76]Oh, fuck.
[349:54.43]Oops.
[349:54.91]Oh no.
[349:55.85]Oh no.
[350:17.28]Why is Wendy's birthday in front of bubble trouble?
[350:24.18]I was probably going to be sub 12.
[350:25.83]Probably even sub 1130.
[350:27.11]Well, let's just see what would happen.
[350:37.55]Let's just see what if.
[351:04.32]I did this so clean last time.
[351:09.69]That sucks.
[351:10.33]It would have been sub 12.
[351:12.19]I know it's an illegal run.
[351:13.55]I'm not saying it's legal.
[351:16.29]Okay, can I do this one more time?
[351:20.01]Move the bowl around the screen using the directional.
[351:22.05]A lot of people don't want me to do this, but can I do it one more time?
[351:25.55]Where can she be?
[351:27.91]That's a sub-12 run right there.
[351:29.95]When do I hit the stop?
[351:31.93]Right when the cutscene ends?
[351:35.03]Please, no.
[351:37.93]Viewers are going to plummet.
[351:43.35]It's only 10 minutes.
[351:45.85]It's the last input.
[351:47.73]It's only 10 minutes.
[351:53.12]Dude, my six-year-old has never been more interested in you.
[352:01.45]Can I have one more attempt?
[352:04.35]I promise.
[352:04.93]This is the last time.
[352:06.59]No resets either.
[352:10.51]And I promise, like, my head's not, like, shaped.
[352:14.04]Like, my head's not made out of clay.
[352:15.62]I promise.
[352:17.77]I don't know what this- I don't know what's going on back here, but I promise it's not- I didn't- It's not what a normal- It's not as abnormal.
[352:26.40]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[352:30.40]You should watch the world record- No, no, I don't wanna- I don't wanna get anything in my head.
[352:33.22]This is it.
[352:42.54]Does it matter what I start with?
[352:45.92]Could I start with Bubble Trouble?
[352:55.22]no why not if you don't get sub 12 you have to drink pilk okay that's fine okay if I get if I don't get sub 12 I'll drink a glass of pilk on stream in like 20 minutes alright this is it this is this is one I'm gonna start with bubble trouble is that illegal can I actually start on this or is that illegal
[353:24.51]read the mod chat world record video stops the timer when the final loading screen pops up the world record starts with the radiators and the crows since they have the most rng interesting
[353:51.22]Alright, so we're starting with Radiator.
[353:53.70]No, we're going to do it my way.
[353:55.84]Starting with Bubble Trouble.
[353:57.86]No resets.
[353:58.80]No bullshit.

[366:39.22]Just so we're all on the same page, you speedran Bob the Builder for an hour before you even considered purchasing a Spyro game for the PS1.
[366:49.93]Sounds about right, I think.
[366:53.98]I'll take 7th place.
[366:54.82]Lucky number 7.
[366:55.18]That was fun.
[366:58.56]Let's move on.
[367:04.41]Alright, coming up next.
[367:05.17]There we go.
[367:09.09]Oh, that's a good one too.
[367:14.10]This one could go pretty hard.
[367:16.98]I've had a bunch of requests to play this.
[367:19.62]And I think we're just gonna... Should we just go for it?
[367:25.88]You have to submit the run?
[367:26.80]Oh, um...
[367:32.83]I don't... Maybe a... I don't know.
[367:37.39]So we got... I want you to pick between two things.
[367:43.07]Pick between Looney Tunes Back in Action or Scooby-Doo Night of a Hundred Frights.
[367:56.65]That's your choice.
[367:58.68]Uh, Scooby-Doo or Looney Tunes?
[368:01.10]Looney Tunes Back in Action or Scooby-Doo Night of 100 Prides.
[368:03.52]These are going to be very popular.
[368:08.74]I knew it.
[368:13.26]We definitely need a poll, though, because I can't decide.
[368:15.19]I mean, we're going to do them both, but... I've seen a lot of Scooby-Doos.
[368:24.29]Oh, yeah, I got it.
[368:29.45]I think I can do it.
[368:31.55]Wait, I created a moment?
[368:32.73]Oh, because of the speedrun?
[368:38.81]Uh, okay.
[368:39.39]I got it up right now.
[368:41.51]Scooby-Doo?
[368:42.21]So what do you want?
[368:42.81]Scooby-Doo?
[368:46.20]Or Looney Tunes?
[368:53.60]How do you spell Looney Tunes?

[369:34.52]And I wrote Scooby Doo and then Looney Tunes.
[369:36.14]The content does not meet guidelines.
[369:47.99]What's happening here?
[369:48.63]Slash poll.

[371:53.00]Okay.
[371:54.28]Alright.
[371:54.98]What's the poll say?
[372:06.21]Whoa.
[372:09.23]I did not even look at it until the last second.
[372:11.39]That's 77%.
[372:11.63]I thought it was going to be way closer than this.
[372:15.03]Why would I even do the poll?
[372:18.40]Alright, Scooby-Doo, Night of a Thousand Year Door.
[372:24.41]Whatever the fuck this game's called.

[372:56.93]Don't laugh at anything that happens with Scooby-Doo.
[372:59.55]I'll try.
[372:59.81]Alright, I won't laugh.
[373:20.80]Drink Pilk if you laugh, okay?
[373:23.46]For how long?

[374:02.46]It's gonna make you laugh.
[374:25.22]The PlayStation browser and system configuration is burnt in now.
[374:28.90]That's a fact.

[382:02.09]Jump.
[382:09.07]Some doors will need a certain number of Scooby Snacks to open.
[382:14.14]I gotta turn the brightness up on this.
[382:16.54]You don't think it would be cool to have Scooby-Doo as a friend for a day?
[382:18.66]I just want to eat a pizza with Scooby-Doo, and then I want him to punch me in the face as hard as he can.
[382:27.13]You know what I mean?
[382:27.99]I just want him to throw a punch in my head.
[382:31.23]I don't know why.
[382:31.77]I feel like that would never happen, ever.
[382:36.61]You only have one opportunity.
[382:39.25]It's like, Scooby-Doo, let's eat a pizza, and then I want you to punch me in the face as hard as you can.
[382:45.99]Like, we need to see how strong he is.

[383:06.90]Hey, yeah, I'm going to eat a pizza with Scooby Doo and then he's going to punch me in the face.
[383:10.66]Why?
[383:12.32]Why would he have to?
[383:12.96]Why would I want him to punch me in the face?
[383:20.57]I just saw like an image of him being like... You're crazy.
[383:26.77]What?
[383:35.96]You got TikTok on the mind?
[383:38.56]Why not?
[383:44.55]Okay, don't stand on these for too long.
[383:57.18]Why do you- Why it's a guard?
[384:02.68]Why do you want this?

[384:53.61]That's a little better.
[384:54.31]Is that better?
[384:56.21]I need to crop it.
[385:03.13]I would, but it's way too much.
[385:05.39]It's too hard.
[385:06.11]Alright, let's go.
[385:06.63]So, I have to go find Shaggy?
[385:10.06]Okay, cool.
[385:12.00]Can I change the camera?
[385:13.02]Okay.
[385:25.37]Something's wrong in my game.
[385:32.93]Oh, never mind.
[385:34.87]There's a laugh track in the game when you do something funny.
[385:44.32]That's awesome.
[385:45.60]Okay.
[385:59.73]What the fuck?
[386:07.11]I don't know about this, Scooby.
[386:10.26]I would let go.
[386:10.94]Let go, Scooby, please.
[386:18.12]I gotta get up there.
[386:18.66]Wasn't anything that funny.
[386:21.67]That was not even funny.
[386:31.83]I wonder if it's random.
[386:37.38]Scooby Dooby Doo!
[386:40.26]Have they ever done that before?
[386:57.34]The background looks like World of Warcraft.
[387:12.96]It does look like World of Warcraft.
[387:20.19]Okay, we have to find Shaggy.
[387:27.03]Looks like Tirisfal Glades.
[387:28.45]150 snacks.
[387:35.78]25, let's go!
[387:50.25]Alright, let's do it.
[388:06.67]Hello?
[388:08.01]Is anyone out there?
[388:10.05]Oh.
[388:10.57]I need some help in here.
[388:11.75]I'm coming.
[388:12.19]Is anyone there?
[388:22.21]Can I- is there an attack?
[388:24.58]You need to find the Professor Springs invention before you can make this jump.
[388:30.70]A Metroid game?
[388:33.16]What?
[388:33.76]Okay, that's cool.
[388:34.74]I'm playing this for a little while.
[388:38.38]Okay.
[389:06.51]Secret.
[389:14.82]What?
[389:15.92]Who made this?
[389:17.06]This is awful.
[389:19.68]Oh, is this a map?
[389:20.16]I thought it was going to be a map of the mansion.
[389:23.60]What is this?
[389:24.30]I can't read that.
[389:29.10]That's not helpful at all.
[389:37.38]It's like Hollow Knight.
[389:43.25]Is that bait?
[389:44.29]Alright, how many snacks do I have?
[390:01.82]That scared the shit out of me.
[390:03.70]Why was that so scary?
[390:09.55]You need the professor's helmet to bash through these webs.
[390:19.30]It really is Hollow Knight.
[390:21.28]Okay.
[390:24.31]Where am I right now?
[390:37.76]You're funny.
[390:38.18]I like your streams.
[390:38.94]Hey, thanks.
[390:40.66]Thanks for, um, hanging out.
[390:44.83]This is the secret door right here.
[390:50.75]How do I open it?
[390:51.91]You can see the outline.
[391:13.83]Where the hell do I go?
[391:21.13]Here's the PS2 version records for this game, by the way.
[391:23.62]26 minutes.
[391:24.26]I'm not doing that.
[391:25.12]I need a shovel.
[391:26.60]Oh.
[391:39.74]Thank you.
[391:40.10]I need a flower patch.
[391:48.24]First item.
[391:52.64]How do I dig?
[391:59.59]Another 60 years and then I can retire.
[392:02.99]Maybe I'll take up gardening.
[392:06.89]That was kind of funny.
[392:08.73]Groovy.
[392:19.76]Wait, did the key come out?
[392:21.56]No.
[392:25.38]I need more flowers.
[392:39.55]Is it really right here?
[392:41.55]Keep.
[392:43.86]Okay, I got the key to here.
[392:46.38]There's smugglers.
[392:51.92]Warp gate.
[392:52.93]Whoa, okay.
[392:56.25]This game is huge.
[393:02.36]This game is enormous.
[393:13.00]Sounds like the Dynast is proud laughter in Hades.
[393:17.01]Oh, yeah.
[393:17.43]The one that goes like.
[393:23.45]So you might be wondering how I got over here so quickly.
[393:26.89]Well, never mind.
[393:28.69]That is what it is.
[393:30.81]Now, move along.
[393:31.71]Holly, you are right.
[393:36.95]I knew I was like, I recognize that somehow.
[393:47.84]Where are the other characters?
[393:49.70]Where is everybody?
[393:50.36]You can jump on top of small monsters and squash them.
[394:15.13]Did he say rats?
[394:16.07]How yummy?
[394:20.09]Scooby-Doo doesn't eat rats, does he?
[394:30.22]Beware, Scooby-Doo, you need one of the professor's inventions to defeat larger monsters.
[394:35.34]How many inventions does the professor have?
[394:41.64]It's just a guy with a... It's a guy.
[394:43.56]It's just a guy.
[394:44.24]I thought it was... Okay.
[395:06.70]Hang on to the pelican for a shortcut back.
[395:08.88]Be sure to grab all the goodies along the way.
[395:13.57]I don't want it anymore.
[395:14.31]What's in here?
[395:15.25]I'm hungry.
[395:45.99]Oh, there he is.
[395:47.93]For a long time.
[395:49.86]New party member.
[395:50.36]Okay.
[396:15.51]Alright, do it.
[396:17.07]Now I know what a rubber band feels like.
[396:23.34]Woo-hoo!
[396:44.63]You go on, Scoob.
[396:46.07]I'm gonna hang around here.
[396:47.23]Yeah, get it?
[396:48.71]Hang around?
[396:49.45]What's the laugh track for that?
[396:51.73]That was the funniest joke so far.
[397:00.25]I want that snack. ...
[397:19.92]Whoa-ho-ho!
[397:21.12]Groovy snacks!
[397:24.22]Nice!
[397:25.70]Oh, I'm nuts!
[397:46.89]Dark Souls?
[397:48.59]Oh, okay.
[397:49.49]I got a warp gate.
[397:50.24]How much do I need to get in here?
[397:51.12]50 snacks!
[397:53.76]Drink Pilk now!
[397:54.78]I'll drink Pilk in exactly 20 minutes.
[397:57.48]I will drink Pilk in exactly 20 minutes.
[397:59.48]Exactly.
[398:00.06]At 7 hours stream, I will drink Pilk. ...
[398:17.90]Take this for a ride?
[398:19.76]I don't want a shortcut.
[398:37.54]Is it going to be oat-pilk?
[398:39.82]Yeah, probably.
[398:41.28]I don't have Pepsi, I have Coke.
[398:43.36]I have Coke and oat milk.
[398:44.46]Sorry, I didn't... I'm not, like, prepared for drinking... ...pilk.
[398:55.79]Can't jump.
[399:00.73]Rags!
[399:01.77]Crabs!
[399:04.94]Oh, you need to get the professor's special boots.
[399:15.80]Oh, I got it.
[399:16.98]Double jump.
[399:22.15]Alright, that's huge.
[399:30.67]It's a delicacy.
[399:34.63]You want me to just do it now?
[399:38.50]Be right back.
[399:42.96]I'm gonna drink some pilk.
[399:44.40]Okay?
[399:44.60]Be right back.
[401:48.08]Okay, so what what is the um, what's the ratio?
[401:52.86]The fucking screen is gonna burn in god damn it.
[401:55.70]You're right.
[401:56.16]It is Shit it is Come on I I gotta It's 50 50 I have to keep this I kept this like a screensaver.
[402:10.80]I have to keep this here Alright, so you're telling me
[402:15.88]So it's 50-50, half and half.
[402:21.26]So... If I take some oat milk... It's oat milk, I'm sorry.
[402:26.23]And just fill it up.
[402:27.09]Fill it halfway.
[402:28.31]I'm gonna prove this is milk.
[402:36.73]Like that?
[402:40.17]What the f-
[402:50.85]The vibration is on the controller.
[402:53.97]Did you hear that?
[402:55.41]It's doing it still.
[403:02.04]Did you got- I don't know if you even heard it.
[403:04.66]Did you hear that?
[403:11.50]That was horrible.
[403:12.93]My whole body hurts.
[403:18.31]Okay, here you go.
[403:19.43]I've got, here is the milk.
[403:21.03]Here it is.
[403:21.83]So now we take the Coca-Cola.
[403:27.14]I thought something just bad just happened.
[403:28.52]I thought like my ceiling caved in.
[403:31.68]Okay.
[403:33.02]Here we go.
[403:33.40]People drink this?
[403:48.87]Do I need to Ster it?
[404:01.75]That's so much.
[404:02.99]That is so much.
[404:03.99]I didn't realize I just made it a lot.
[404:06.21]I just made it as if I love this and I'm going to drink it all the time every day.
[404:09.89]That's a full glass.
[404:11.92]I'm going to fucking break it.
[404:13.48]Get away from me.
[404:14.32]Stop.
[404:15.92]That's a lot.
[404:18.08]Oh, I have to drink this.
[404:43.83]okay it tastes like you know when you have a a float like a root beer float or a coke float and you get to the very very bottom but there's nothing left in the glass but there's a little bit of this weird foam fluid down there that's what this tastes like
[405:10.90]I mean, it's not that good.
[405:13.84]But I wouldn't consider this to be bad.
[405:15.36]I wouldn't say this is bad.
[405:21.31]This does not... This does not taste bad.
[405:29.01]You guys are gonna get me so fucked up now.
[405:30.57]I'm... Just wait.
[405:31.73]I'm gonna drink this, like, tomorrow and the next day and the next day and be like, Yeah, I'm just doing it ironically.
[405:35.99]Same shit's gonna happen to me.
[405:37.89]Like Takis.
[405:39.68]I bought Takis.
[405:40.94]I tried them.
[405:41.50]I told you guys they were the most disgusting, vile snack I've ever eaten.
[405:46.06]And now I can't stop eating them.
[405:52.31]I seriously thought Takis were a zero.
[405:56.05]Zero.
[405:58.90]And I just was like, oh, I think me and Holly were literally at the grocery store.
[406:04.19]It's like, oh, let's get those.
[406:05.97]Isn't that funny?
[406:06.69]Yeah, they're gross.
[406:08.11]They suck.
[406:08.85]I haven't had them in a while.
[406:09.67]You want to try one?
[406:10.25]And then we both go like, oh, that lime's kind of good, though.
[406:18.18]Oh, gross.
[406:19.16]I hate you.
[406:19.60]Hate them, too.
[406:20.68]I hate them, too.
[406:22.95]And then.
[406:25.37]ever since I've bought them every time I've ever gone to the grocery store since.
[406:30.39]It's not an ironic funny joke anymore.
[406:33.53]I'm just doing it, and I just enjoy it, and I like it.
[406:35.51]What's wrong with me?
[406:49.35]It's not good.
[406:49.97]Like, I just, it's not good.
[406:53.74]But it's definitely not the reaction I think a lot of people thought was going to happen where I'm like... Like spitting it.
[406:58.24]No.
[406:58.62]It's like fine.
[407:00.34]It tastes like fizzy milk.
[407:03.32]It tastes like carbonated milk.
[407:05.66]But sweet.
[407:07.12]It's like the bottom of a root beer float.
[407:09.34]It's just like, whatever.
[407:10.50]You have serious problems.
[407:16.53]You're gaslighting yourself.
[407:20.18]Yeah, it's the bottom of a root beer float.
[407:21.80]If you know, if you know, you know.
[407:23.56]I would not recommend drinking this for any reason.
[407:25.64]Unless it's like somebody bet you and they're like, oh, dude, drink milk.
[407:28.05]It'll be funny.
[407:31.47]This shit is fucking gold, though.
[407:35.55]This shit is gold.
[407:37.03]This is the good shit.
[407:37.87]I'm telling you.
[407:38.47]This is the good shit.
[407:40.85]You want, you want, you want to drink gold milk?
[407:42.61]Get it.
[407:42.81]I'm telling you.
[407:43.59]This is the good shit.
[407:46.65]This is a delicacy in this household.
[407:53.08]Alright, let me bring this back.
[407:54.34]I don't want to put it in the fridge.
[409:11.28]Is Scooby-Doo gonna get burnt into the screen?
[409:14.22]I fucking... I'm done with this.
[409:17.16]Why is it vibrating?
[409:17.90]Show what on the screen is happening for it to be vibrating.
[409:20.14]Show me.
[409:23.30]What is going on on screen to have to vibrate the controller that hard?
[409:28.84]God, I need a break.
[409:29.58]That's a good break.
[409:43.16]Is Scooby scratching?
[409:44.34]Alright, so what can I do with the double jump?
[410:01.61]Sue's drunk on milk.
[410:07.60]Jump off the boat with a double jump?
[410:21.07]Thank you for playing these, even if you had to skip Vampire Countdown.
[410:26.07]I mean, I like just kind of jumping on random shit for like an hour or so.
[410:33.34]These old kind of grab bag nights.
[410:38.04]You never know what you're going to get if you beat anything.
[410:39.80]We could get absolute dog shit or we could get a fucking legendary Bionicle game.
[410:43.46]You know what I mean?
[410:48.84]Can I not go this way?
[410:54.01]Oh, I thought that was it.
[410:56.39]Alright, so let's go in the boat and somebody to jump off the boat.
[411:13.72]Alright, there was something I couldn't reach before, right?
[411:17.82]Where should I go?
[411:29.10]How is that not reaching?
[411:36.44]How can this not reach?
[411:40.93]I'm touching it.
[411:46.53]What is Scooby Doo's favorite food?
[411:48.69]Do we know?
[411:49.15]Is it a Scooby snack?
[411:55.15]Has it actually ever been decided what it is?
[412:00.01]Is it Scooby Snacks?
[412:00.73]I feel like that's so... I feel like that's easy, though.
[412:03.65]Oh, it's like a crunchy, like, dog treat.
[412:07.60]It's not like a lasagna?
[412:08.94]No, that's that stupid fucking little shit cat, whatever that other one, you know, whatever it is.
[412:15.36]Green, orange, whatever.
[412:21.24]Green cat.
[412:22.62]Oh.
[412:32.50]How do you grab?
[412:33.28]I can't grab onto this seagull.
[412:34.66]Whatever the hell.
[412:45.50]How do you grab?
[412:46.52]Why do you hate Garfios so much?
[412:53.65]Um...
[412:59.24]I don't.
[413:04.50]Hang on to the pelican for a shortcut.
[413:06.26]How do I grab the pelican?
[413:07.46]Okay, alright.
[413:35.64]Stop kid!
[413:36.30]I'm about to take it out.
[413:41.18]I'm about to press the button.
[413:48.15]Nope.
[414:06.20]Where is this bird?
[414:09.29]I'm just going back.
[414:34.74]Alright if somebody ran for Congress and they just had a scooby-doo avatar And they did the voice
[414:59.05]Do you think they would win?
[415:01.85]Do you think that they would actually win?
[415:08.44]What if they had, like, good policy?
[415:10.98]I feel like it'd be kind of funny.
[415:17.76]That's a Black Mirror episode.
[415:19.04]That is a Black Mirror episode!
[415:20.52]Fuck!
[415:21.85]What a great show.
[415:31.10]This one was 150.
[415:32.20]Yeah.
[415:36.44]Rip off Randy.
[415:37.40]Rip off Randy.
[415:42.93]I didn't rip anybody off.
[415:49.87]It fell off during season five.
[415:51.09]I actually haven't watched it since probably like season two, season three.
[416:06.02]What was even in here?
[416:21.15]Oh, my monster collection.
[416:27.40]This was not... Why did I spend 150 bucks on this?
[416:48.47]I don't have any monsters.
[416:51.00]There's a hundred.
[416:51.76]No.
[416:54.74]Not the game.
[416:57.10]The Scooby Snacks.
[416:58.78]This game was not $150.
[417:13.72]You bought this for it.
[417:14.68]No, I did not.
[417:15.82]How much?
[417:16.14]I think this game was like five dollars.
[417:17.58]It was a little more than that.
[417:31.47]I have the double jump.
[417:32.17]I can jump across.
[417:34.49]How much?
[417:34.79]Alright.
[417:35.61]It was 20 bucks.
[417:36.35]Okay.
[417:37.97]Worth it.
[417:39.23]It was worth it.
[417:46.17]I got a token?
[417:51.08]Yes, this was $20.
[417:51.88]Okay.
[417:52.02]Ooh, I can go up here now.
[418:16.34]You lying son of a gun.
[418:19.26]It's $100.
[418:20.08]This was not $100.
[418:20.76]Why would I lie about something so stupid?
[418:49.80]Holy shit.
[418:59.46]That was pretty good.
[419:00.42]Alright.
[419:01.54]Onto the chandelier.
[419:03.46]Shit.
[419:03.72]How do I get up there?
[419:13.76]What do you do with the tokens?
[419:14.58]The tokens just sit in your inventory?
[419:19.86]Because I can't get in here.
[419:20.62]I tried to... Did I press the mute button?
[419:29.28]I tried to press the mute button over here.
[419:36.80]I don't think I can do anything else.
[419:48.85]I need the headbutt.
[420:09.47]I don't have the headbutt.
[420:13.67]Where can I get the headbutt?
[420:22.13]Where did I not go?
[420:23.51]There's a key outside you can double jump to.
[420:29.41]Sick.
[420:29.81]Thank you.
[420:30.23]Right?
[420:40.34]Key outside?
[420:44.92]I can't believe you've been playing this for seven full hours.
[420:47.18]It's a good game!
[421:01.27]Okay, someone said I can jump to a key that's somewhere out here.
[421:11.03]Where is it?
[421:26.02]The playground?
[421:31.14]There's a gap in the mansion.
[421:38.12]I don't think there's anything over here.
[421:47.95]Gap in the mansion?
[421:51.47]You mean outside though, right?
[421:53.07]What's the name of the current game?
[421:53.89]This is Scooby-Doo Night of 100 Frights.
[422:03.85]That sip was not very good.
[422:04.82]I think I got a lot of... Something's settled.
[422:08.86]I don't know what's settled.
[422:11.16]If it was the Coke or the oat milk, but something's settled.
[422:20.57]Cap in the mansion?
[422:36.07]Alright, we're moving on.
[422:37.53]This is fun.
[422:39.21]This is a cool one.
[422:43.86]This is cool.
[422:45.86]It was right there.
[422:50.48]Hey, I just had knee surgery.
[422:51.90]Can you do Velma?
[422:54.84]Oh, wait, that's knee surgery guy.
[422:56.89]Knee surgery guy.
[422:58.05]You had surgery and you woke up?
[423:00.89]That's knee surgery guy.
[423:01.81]That was like seven hours ago, wasn't it?
[423:07.47]How'd it go?
[423:07.83]Did it go good?
[423:14.01]Oh, this key is right here.
[423:20.35]How did it go?
[423:20.79]Right?
[423:20.91]Probably.
[423:48.32]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[423:55.93]Another helmet.
[423:58.93]Right, it's a werewolf.
[424:03.53]Yummy.
[424:04.81]That was weird.
[424:10.62]Weird.
[424:21.25]Dig the flower.
[424:21.99]Dig the flower.
[424:22.85]Okay.
[424:27.93]Yikes.
[424:34.98]It was a sandwich.
[424:36.08]Why did I come back for this?
[424:40.95]I thought that was an NPC.
[424:56.19]He's hungry.
[425:02.48]I just get hit by every single enemy.
[425:10.85]Jeremy, you're the target audience for YouTube shorts.
[425:16.21]I don't think I am because I don't really watch them.
[425:18.45]Going up there.
[425:40.65]I can't.
[425:41.65]I can't do it.
[426:01.99]That's a small enemy spider.
[426:03.61]That's not a big enemy.
[426:10.81]Here are two of the professor's inventions, the slippers and the lampshade.
[426:13.61]You can use the slippers to sneak quietly past monsters by holding R2, or the lampshade to hide from monsters by holding R2.
[426:23.54]Use your new lampshade and slippers to avoid the zombie.
[426:42.52]Where's the zombie?
[426:43.66]Right?
[426:44.72]Right?
[427:13.94]oh wait wait please
[427:45.65]Hey dude, your editors have been doing zoom in on your face thing.
[428:17.13]oh that's like I've been doing the zoom in on your face thing I know exactly what you are talking about I know exactly what that means oh I'm alive
[428:43.15]What happened?
[428:43.55]Why did I die?
[428:47.61]Oh, I got hit by a dart.
[428:49.07]Alright.
[428:50.43]One more try and then I'm putting another game in.
[428:54.45]This game's fun though.
[428:56.91]It's very nice.
[429:00.92]I can see being a big fan of the show and playing this when I was a kid.
[429:04.76]Or an adult, whatever it is.
[429:05.74]This is very cool.
[429:13.05]Very nice game.
[429:15.47]Very enjoyable.
[429:16.47]We're going to move on.
[429:21.47]Get out of the way.
[429:25.50]You're just walking away.
[429:26.40]Ruby.
[429:28.94]Ruby snacks.
[429:40.55]I understand this map, but it still confuses me when I look at it.
[429:46.21]You gotta play Spyro for the surgery guy.
[429:47.93]Is that what the knee surgery guy said?
[429:49.69]Where did you get that?
[430:08.49]Hey, Scoob, better hop on quick.
[430:10.95]This thing has a mind of its own.
[430:15.25]Okay, Suggie.
[430:16.57]Look out, Scoob.
[430:26.88]Ruby's next.
[430:33.51]Jump, Scoob.

[430:59.04]Alright, I'm moving on.
[431:03.00]I'm moving on.
[431:03.32]We'll do another one.
[431:03.96]We'll do one more try on this and I'm going to do...
[431:10.54]It's Bob the Builder, we're not doing that again.
[431:14.12]Um... Some of these are gonna feel so bad.
[431:19.33]Has anybody ever heard of this game?
[431:24.63]Largo Winch?
[431:26.23]Have you ever played this?
[431:35.57]Largo Winch?
[431:42.45]I looked at the... It looked fun.

[433:04.98]Oh.
[433:05.84]Who's that?
[433:07.02]Why did I just read that?
[433:07.94]Who is that?
[433:11.64]Who's this?
[433:12.08]Come on, Scoob.
[433:14.13]Let's get going.
[433:20.95]Oh, it's the person that said, please.
[433:27.37]Oh, okay.
[433:28.59]I'm curious.
[433:31.51]I want to know what's in here.

[434:48.46]And... No, you cannot see my fucking armpits.
[434:55.87]I wanna know what Snuffy was playing!
[434:59.26]I asked a question!
[435:00.04]Nobody's told me anything.
[435:17.31]Nobody said anything.
[435:21.17]Funny videos?
[435:21.85]Aw, sick.
[435:27.15]yeah welcome uh we're doing old PlayStation 1 PlayStation 2 omega night this is an omega weekend what that means is uh I'm just not turning this off until I feel like it
[435:53.10]We're not going to be playing Scooby Doo the whole time.
[435:54.58]Don't leave.
[435:56.04]Please don't leave.
[435:58.28]We're going to be playing, in fact, something really interesting next coming up.
[436:01.79]That was a cake.
[436:08.99]Holy shit.
[436:13.18]What?
[436:24.16]Alright, I'm gonna get through this section and then we'll change to the next one.
[436:27.23]Like the spy game.
[436:28.43]This is actually kind of a fun platformer.
[436:41.51]What did I play recently that I actually- the Crash Bandicoot game, right?
[436:45.81]It was like a Crash remake or Crash 4.
[436:49.06]What was that?
[436:49.56]That was very good.
[436:50.48]That was very fun.
[436:55.18]That was exceptionally fun.
[436:57.42]Crash 4, yeah.
[436:59.33]That was really fun.
[437:01.11]You should finish it.
[437:03.01]Maybe one day.
[437:26.54]Alright, that's fun.
[437:28.42]Let's go.
[437:34.64]This game's called Largo Winch.
[437:39.30]Lando?
[437:42.09]I don't know.
[437:42.35]I'll find out.
[437:49.33]I'm very interested.
[437:50.81]I'm just as interested as you are.
[437:51.91]It's called Largo Winch.
[437:59.63]I have never heard of this before.
[438:00.93]Until literally, like, maybe four days ago.
[438:05.93]Five days ago.
[438:08.31]What's for dinner?
[438:09.09]Um, that's a good question.
[438:10.03]I don't know.
[438:11.95]Hmm.
[438:16.54]Ubisoft game?
[438:23.74]Doop.
[438:25.66]For you.
[438:26.22]Oh.
[438:37.33]Based on the TV series Largo Winch adapted from the cartoon... What?
[438:44.31]This is a TV show?
[438:46.45]Okay, alright, let's go!
[439:10.52]I don't know how to play.
[439:21.30]Hmm.
[439:25.04]Welcome to the construction site, Largo.
[439:26.66]When you're ready, come and join me inside.
[439:28.44]Use the directional button on the left analog to walk.
[439:30.90]This game's very crunchy.
[439:41.84]We're a little late, so let's race to the quarantine cabin.
[439:46.14]You're on!
[439:47.40]Hold down R2 to run.
[439:55.58]I can hear this game in my teeth.
[439:59.60]Well, that got my circulation going.
[440:05.03]Let me show you how to use objects.
[440:06.57]Walk up to the button and press X.
[440:12.66]I just punched.
[440:43.33]I don't know.
[440:43.99]I don't know how to do it.
[440:48.15]Press the button?
[440:54.06]No.
[440:55.62]Good.
[440:55.90]Remember, to use any object, press X button.
[440:58.96]Unfortunately, this button seems to be broken.
[441:01.54]We don't have the time to wait to get it fixed, so you'll have to do it yourself.
[441:05.32]What?
[441:05.58]Try this toolkit.
[441:07.97]Pick it up, just walk over it, and then try pressing X button and then switch again.
[441:14.45]Why do I walk and waddle around like I'm made out of fucking clay?
[441:22.33]Okay, I got a toolkit.
[441:28.89]Pick up the toolkit by wa- I just did it.
[441:31.81]Did you not just watch me do that?
[441:34.67]Very good, you're learning fast.
[441:35.91]To see what objects you have in your possession, press select.
[441:38.87]Okay.
[441:41.00]Cool.
[441:41.58]Bare hands.
[441:50.73]Sometimes you'll have to search other objects to get them.
[441:52.95]This door needs a security card to open it.
[441:54.47]There's one in that desk.
[442:14.46]Did you just cut me off when I was in the middle of doing it?
[442:18.73]I was doing it.
[442:33.11]Get the fuck out of here.
[442:44.52]I'm just kidding with you.
[442:47.40]I'm just messing around.
[442:48.22]Hey, you locked me out.
[442:59.00]Make your way around the side.
[443:01.11]I'll see you later.
[443:08.37]Don't get stuck in this game.
[443:15.49]Climb over any obstacle.
[443:17.90]Good to know.
[443:18.42]I never would have figured that out.
[443:24.30]You want to watch out for the excavation?
[443:27.00]Run up to it and then jump over it using triangle.
[443:29.95]Don't miss though.
[443:30.85]It's a long way down.
[443:40.17]oops okay mid jump you got up I think I can fucking make it I can I can make it I can I can I can I can I can I got a prediction I think this might be the gem of the night I'm just saying
[444:05.72]I'm just saying, I think this has got unbelievable potential, and I mean unbelievable potential.
[444:28.82]Clippers just have the 9 on their back, what is that?
[444:35.12]practice punching and kicking.
[444:36.30]There's a kick?
[444:41.18]Oh, that is not a kick.
[444:42.52]That is a, like, a toe stop.
[444:54.93]Oh, I can't wait to play this.
[444:56.91]Okay, you will find blocking to be very useful in any fights you get into.
[445:00.42]I think I... Okay, block.
[445:17.38]Will you do something?
[445:18.36]He's not fighting.
[445:23.46]He's not... Kick his ass?
[445:31.48]I'm supposed to be blocking a punch.
[445:32.74]He just won't punch.
[445:35.70]Punch me.
[445:36.36]Please.
[445:37.96]What?
[445:48.77]How do I stop looking at this guy?
[445:50.15]Wait, did I go the wrong way?
[446:00.77]Where... Where are we right now?
[446:13.68]Where are we?
[446:14.38]This is a strange... It's like dirt, wood, concrete.
[446:23.13]What is going on?
[446:24.95]It's a construction site?
[446:28.53]This looks just weird.
[446:30.07]It's just a weird place.
[446:31.19]How do I get the hell out of here?
[446:37.63]He said, follow me.
[446:38.55]Follow you to... Follow you where?
[446:47.58]Can you open this?
[446:48.22]Open the door.
[446:48.66]The ring.
[446:54.04]His foot ring.
[446:59.15]Down the ramp.
[447:05.35]I physically could not walk down there a minute ago.
[447:08.21]I was running into an invisible wall.
[447:15.42]You won't kill a guard with this move.
[447:34.30]Good, that's not my style anyway.
[447:36.86]I know, however, he'll be out cold for a while.
[447:39.98]So I don't need to worry about him waking up while I'm still around.
[447:42.28]Correct.
[447:44.00]One more thing, if you're going to pull this move off, the guard has to be totally unaware of your presence.
[447:49.67]Okay.
[447:56.85]Combo.
[448:00.37]Yeah, alright, why not do this?
[448:12.18]Alright, good, good, good, good, good.
[448:13.48]Alright, I'm ready.
[448:14.03]I'm going to try out all the skills you've learned.
[448:18.99]He's not going to show any mercy.
[448:42.88]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[448:50.05]Okay.
[448:51.77]Sneak into the factory.
[448:54.01]No!
[448:54.21]I'm not nearly as stealthy as you.
[448:56.51]I got the blueprints and the details of the patrol route.
[449:00.32]Alright, I'll go.
[449:11.38]Is there a heal?
[449:18.85]Okay, hold down R1 to sneak.
[449:49.82]Use the brainwave monitor?
[450:18.39]This guard isn't looking in your directions, you sneakers.
[450:20.96]Okay.
[450:35.43]You can peer around corners by holding L2 and use the controls.
[450:39.65]Okay.
[451:21.69]okay so what's okay crouch is r1 is he looking over here
[452:05.52]Where can I leave?
[452:11.28]What are you talking... No, no, game over.
[452:13.24]Not game over.
[452:14.08]The guy's looking this way and this way.
[452:16.64]He's looking this way and this way.
[452:17.61]He's looking the same direction.
[452:22.17]Who the fuck is this guy?
[452:29.05]Oh my god.
[452:29.71]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[452:34.30]What?
[452:34.40]This might be causing the crackling?
[452:36.34]The disc speed thing?
[452:37.81]Oh, is it spinning too fast?
[452:38.93]Okay, good, good, good, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[452:50.89]Here's this guy.
[453:21.65]Whoa!
[453:22.35]Okay.
[453:23.17]Don't peek your head out like that.
[453:24.28]Stop.
[453:24.56]Alright, so how can I tell when this guy can see me?
[453:33.08]He's looking like this, and then he's looking like this.
[453:45.85]What direction is he looking?
[453:56.85]Because to me, he's looking in the same direction.
[453:59.61]Oh my god, he's looking at me.
[454:03.26]Oh my god!
[454:04.44]Is this a sex game?
[454:19.63]Fan that person for like 10 minutes.
[454:38.24]Shadows are your friend, okay?
[454:39.68]You can hide in them.
[454:56.95]Where is this person?
[455:03.69]Whoa!
[455:28.19]I quit.
[455:28.63]I don't want to do stealth shit.
[455:30.87]Let me play the game.
[455:33.87]Wait.
[455:38.31]I think I fucked the game up.
[455:39.19]I'm good.
[455:42.07]Yeah, I messed it up.
[455:48.72]Okay, they beep at regular intervals.
[455:50.18]Okay.
[455:59.33]What just happened?
[456:00.25]That was a ref- wait.
[456:02.29]Uh, something got messed up here.
[456:30.69]Alright.
[457:02.33]Thank you.
[457:35.82]What?
[457:36.96]Why was he right behind me?
[457:38.02]I don't need to do the training anymore.
[457:44.63]I'm done.
[457:46.09]I know how to play the game, okay?
[457:47.99]I don't need to do this anymore.
[458:29.66]Fuck!
[458:30.06]No!
[458:37.55]okay what happened the shocking scene before you is that of the appalling situation that has developed at the opening of the w chemical factory here in Venezuela the south American redemption have taken over the building but insist their intentions are peaceful
[458:57.62]So what do I have to do?
[458:58.62]Is this an AI voice?
[459:25.33]Another shocking development.
[459:27.33]It appears Largo and Tanya are being held hostage.
[459:33.60]What?
[459:37.68]Wait, OK, so I got to get in there.
[459:42.12]Largo, Largo, come on.
[459:44.42]What's wrong, Joy?
[459:46.66]Simon, Largo has been kidnapped by operatives from the South American Redemption.
[459:52.25]He'll be okay, Joey.
[459:52.91]He's been in situations like this before.
[459:54.39]If anyone can escape, Largo can.
[459:56.19]I hope you're right.
[459:59.36]Find out.
[459:59.72]Okay, this is where the game begins.
[460:06.05]I'm ready.
[460:21.52]What?
[460:21.96]Oh.
[460:23.62]Can I... I'll get you out of here.
[460:28.00]Can I untie?
[460:30.30]No.
[460:31.16]Is there... No.
[460:31.80]I probably need, like, a thing.
[460:36.53]I must find a way to get the power back on in here.
[460:43.91]There's a fuse missing.
[460:47.22]My toolkit?
[460:50.38]No?
[460:50.54]No?
[460:52.81]Punch the ropes.
[460:56.05]I swear I'll figure it out.
[460:57.09]Wait, maybe I can go inside this car.
[460:58.77]Maybe I can get a car battery.
[461:02.85]Yeah, I think I can.
[461:03.65]Okay.
[461:12.51]Elevator should work.
[461:23.64]Get out of here.
[461:27.94]I didn't think that was an elevator.
[461:29.62]I have to be honest.
[461:39.85]Why would I just leave that person?
[461:47.56]Gun.
[461:48.04]That's a gun.
[461:49.42]Oh, it's a radio.
[461:54.67]They're not peaceful at all.
[461:55.75]They planted a bomb inside the main building somewhere.
[461:58.01]You have to find it and defuse it.
[462:02.17]Do I have to?
[462:04.09]Who am I?
[462:04.57]I've got to stop these people.
[462:26.49]I think we got too much coffee.
[462:32.82]I have no idea what he said.
[462:58.48]Oh shit!
[463:04.34]Turn around and face him!
[463:11.04]Fucking Christ.
[463:19.51]We're good, go!
[463:20.51]Nope.
[463:37.73]Fargo.
[463:38.79]They've got the main doors locked down.
[463:40.23]There's no way through.
[463:41.09]Find another way around.
[463:41.89]Okay, I will.
[463:46.38]Thanks for the info.
[463:55.12]Here?
[463:57.94]He spent $400 on this.
[463:59.18]No, this one was seven bucks.
[464:07.51]Don't fucking knock me out, please.
[464:41.00]What the fuck are you talking about?
[464:42.92]No, I need... I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[465:07.42]Okay, I can't go in the main door.
[465:08.66]Where the hell is this other door?
[465:12.43]Gotta stop these people.
[465:14.51]Classic.
[465:22.07]You know what?
[465:22.55]No, fuck this.
[465:23.97]Just run.
[465:26.09]Why would I fight anybody?
[465:27.11]Nobody has a gun.
[465:29.77]God damn it.
[465:51.51]How do I get out of here?
[465:52.31]Where is this person?
[465:54.93]Go in the window?
[466:30.30]Oh shit!
[466:31.51]They were doing that on purpose!
[466:33.41]He was NPC walking and the other guy wasn't gonna ambush me.
[466:39.09]Get up there!
[466:39.98]Get up there!
[466:46.05]I can go up there.
[466:46.67]I can get up there.

[466:50.25]I'm just gonna, I'm just running.
[466:53.87]This game is terrible.
[466:55.15]I mean, it's, it's, I, it's charming to me.
[466:59.49]I am very charmed by this.
[467:00.79]I, no, we're not doing, not next game.
[467:02.31]Not yet.
[467:04.03]No, not yet.
[467:12.45]I am not changing games until I get a like 2x4 or like a gun or something.
[467:17.79]You know what I mean?
[467:18.43]I ain't just gonna... We're not just moving on.
[467:21.17]Not yet.
[467:22.05]Not worth it.
[467:25.15]Okay, so where was that?
[467:27.71]I gotta go straight... We need to hear him talk some more.
[467:32.36]You don't think we need to hear like at least another 10 minutes of conversations?
[467:38.98]Okay, I'm going.
[467:54.73]Aha.
[467:56.15]What are we gonna do now?
[467:56.75]What are we gonna do about it?
[468:00.37]Can I kick him in the head?
[468:16.58]Why did I not knock him?
[468:29.27]What?
[468:29.47]I didn't knock him out.
[468:37.83]Don't you dare.
[468:38.73]It took me so long to get here.
[468:48.83]I think I'm safe.
[469:32.93]You're very close to the bomb.
[469:34.41]You have to... You have... You got anything you can use to defuse it?
[469:38.75]Yes, Joy.
[469:39.59]It's all under control.
[469:41.14]I don't have anything.
[469:42.60]I have... Now I have a minute.
[469:50.76]Get out of my way.
[469:53.16]Get out of my way.
[469:56.86]I'm gonna fucking punch this guy in the face as hard as I can.
[470:00.18]Why...
[470:03.57]I only have 37 seconds!
[470:09.90]Where's the bomb?
[470:14.86]Where is it?
[470:16.64]Where's the bomb?
[470:29.13]There it is!
[470:29.47]Oh, how do I defuse it?
[470:44.45]Mr. Vince.
[470:46.47]Unfortunate business in Venezuela last week, I hear.
[470:49.74]Nothing I can't handle, Ms.
[470:50.94]Fritz.
[470:51.36]What can I do for you?
[470:52.54]I'd like to make you an offer for the chemical factory.
[470:55.40]Isn't it considered a high-risk investment by your people?
[470:57.90]Nothing we can't handle.
[470:59.16]Do you intend to sell?
[471:00.24]No, Ms.
[471:00.70]Fritz.
[471:01.20]I do not intend to sell.
[471:02.77]I'm a powerful woman, Mr. Vince.
[471:05.09]You may regret saying no to me.
[471:11.11]Any idea what just happened?
[471:15.28]Was he talking to me?
[471:16.00]Oh.
[471:34.84]I need the PlayStation 1 card.
[471:37.87]Not the PlayStation 2.
[471:41.68]You will regret saying no to me.
[471:46.01]See what I mean?
[471:46.53]No, I just want to sit on my couch.
[471:49.61]Oh, you're going to sell all of your stock to me.
[471:51.95]No, I don't, no.
[471:53.07]Just leave me alone.
[471:53.67]I just want to sit on the couch and watch TV.
[471:57.17]I want nothing to do with this.
[471:57.99]I wonder what she's planning.
[472:05.42]Yes, I'm here.
[472:06.05]I'm going on an excursion.
[472:08.99]I want to find out what motivated the Tsar to attack my factory last week.
[472:12.75]Well, I own the factory.
[472:14.11]That was my factory?
[472:16.17]Who's the person that was... Wait.
[472:21.18]I owned that factory.
[472:29.92]He hates us.
[472:30.69]What?
[472:31.69]You were beating up your own guards.
[472:38.44]Okay, Largo.
[472:39.56]You need to find some information on the SAR.
[472:41.98]There should be a safe at the top floor.
[472:43.52]Try to find your way up there.
[472:45.79]Largo, this is a strictly covert operation.
[472:47.75]Don't let anyone see you, and that includes cameras.
[472:49.75]Alright, well, what are we playing next?
[473:17.62]Don't let anyone see you.
[473:20.86]This is... Oh, this is awful.
[473:25.73]Pivot to Looney Tunes.
[473:26.63]Pivot to Looney Tunes after this.
[473:27.49]Pivot to Looney Tunes.
[473:45.80]Is this person looking over here?
[473:53.27]Pivot, pivot.
[473:53.89]Hold on.
[473:54.31]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[474:04.51]Why can't I punch?
[474:12.04]Why can't I punch him?
[474:13.60]Oh, it's because I'm holding the computer in my hand.
[474:16.68]Pivot, pivot.
[474:17.22]Alright, I'll pivot.
[474:18.42]We're going to pivot.
[474:18.88]We're going to pivot.
[474:19.80]This game is so funny, though.
[474:21.36]Like, it's so good.
[474:28.97]How do I put this down?
[474:31.81]I can't put the computer down.
[474:36.86]Yeah, I can't put the computer down.
[474:37.92]Alright, we're gonna play Looney Tunes.
[474:41.90]Looney Tunes back in action, coming up.
[474:50.29]Let me pee one more time, and I'll come right back.
[477:49.62]I am back.
[477:54.79]Probably going to call it after Looney Tunes.
[477:58.17]I think that's a good place to do it.
[478:00.67]After like eight, nine hours or so.
[478:07.76]Yeah, it's going to burn in, isn't it?
[478:09.24]It is.
[478:09.96]It's okay.
[478:10.52]It's alright.
[478:17.81]This is Looney Tunes back in action.
[478:31.37]You want to do more infomercials?
[478:32.67]Yeah.
[478:33.63]Definitely.
[478:42.42]I don't want to go too late, Pacific.
[478:45.64]Oh, shit.
[478:57.11]Okay.
[478:59.01]I never played this game.
[478:59.83]Was this game good?
[479:04.47]I never played it.
[479:05.13]You gonna stream tomorrow?
[479:09.91]I think so.
[479:10.91]I think that's the plan.
[479:14.11]We'll see.
[479:15.34]Either tomorrow or Monday.
[479:24.22]That means no.
[479:32.24]No, I'll be live tomorrow.
[479:33.00]Okay.
[479:51.53]ABC?
[479:57.62]Play traffic attack?
[480:01.40]Play, right?
[480:08.27]Yeah, I got Xbox to do as well.
[480:11.15]Now, I have a question for you guys.
[480:12.21]Tomorrow, do you want more PS1, PS2, or do you want to do some Xbox tomorrow?
[480:17.70]What do you think?
[480:22.12]You want to get a poll up?
[480:24.52]Xbox or more PS2, PS1?
[480:28.77]That's what we'll do tomorrow.
[480:39.92]About half and half?
[480:40.66]We could.
[480:46.62]Ha ha!
[480:47.58]Soon the whole world will be helpless before me.
[480:50.58]Watch as I transform you into my simian sways with this, the magical blue monkey diamond.
[480:57.86]Elmer Fudd is... Robotnik?
[481:00.60]If I have anything to say about it, evildoer, prepare to suffer the righteous fury of my oversized foam latex muffles.
[481:09.07]The girls love them.
[481:11.75]Hold it.
[481:13.05]Hold it?
[481:16.20]What do you mean, hold it?
[481:17.75]Don't you want to see my righteous fury?
[481:20.25]It's really righteous.
[481:21.93]Daffy, I'm afraid you're just not action star material.
[481:25.43]Who?
[481:26.23]Well, I guess we know what 65 years of loyal service is worth in this town.
[481:31.21]Thanks a lot, Mr. Moral Support.
[481:38.02]It's a smash hit.
[481:39.06]I love it.
[481:40.06]And to think I already went out of pocket for this prop diamond.
[481:44.50]Five bucks at the pawn shop.
[481:46.94]Why, it's the real blue monkey diamond.
[481:49.44]Okay, so it's not an original concept, but...
[481:52.91]This guy looks like the car accident guy.
[482:04.30]I began by taking over the studio that gave my company such a bad name.
[482:09.80]And now with this diamond, I can turn everyone into monkeys and conquer the world!
[482:15.67]Starting with the two of you!
[482:17.17]Mwahahahaha!
[482:20.03]Hollywood executive who's sacredly evil?
[482:22.55]Should we be surprised?
[482:24.47]Nah, but the mask was a nice touch.
[482:30.97]Huh?
[482:31.96]Well, that wasn't supposed to happen.
[482:37.58]Big diamond, big diamond.
[482:40.66]When is Daffy gonna be in multiverses?

[482:52.93]Get back here, you little lifetime of total financial security.
[482:58.29]Did someone say security?
[483:04.90]This is pretty funny.
[483:06.80]He just didn't even get a sentence out.
[483:08.42]I don't think I've ever heard him do that.
[483:12.14]Alright.
[483:12.50]Acme mailboxes are everywhere.

[487:22.51]Well, I'm less concerned about like people spreading that.

[487:35.74]I don't know why.
[487:37.02]I have no idea what logic that was.
[487:40.25]No, they'll spread it because I have a funny face and they'll make like memes about it.
[487:46.46]But what do you think would happen if you did the other thing?

[492:47.87]There's wanted posters up for me everywhere.
[492:51.01]I'm a hunted duck, doomed to prowl the land, always on the run, always searching for that man with one arm.
[492:59.52]Say, they're not after me.
[493:02.08]I could bash all those wanted duck posters to pieces and make you a free duck.
[493:07.98]Yeah, okay.
[493:08.72]You're a genius.
[493:09.72]Thanks, bug.

[493:17.12]So start tumbling.
[493:19.54]Careful.
[493:27.21]Throw us out if it catches.

[497:14.27]I love doing this.
[497:15.49]You know what the best part about doing this is?
[497:17.95]There's just no pressure for any of these to be any good.
[497:22.51]It's just like, yeah, throw one in.
[497:24.07]Does it suck?
[497:24.75]Who cares?

[497:32.49]And there's a shitload still to do.
[497:33.95]So we'll do some Xbox tomorrow.
[497:36.27]Probably opening with the Matrix.
[497:39.41]I've owned the Matrix video game, Enter the Matrix, for at least a year or two, and I haven't played it.
[497:45.67]So I really want to play it.
[497:47.41]So we'll be doing, we'll start with that around two o'clock Pacific time.
[497:53.34]See you guys later.
