[00:00.56]Bread and Fred.
[00:07.86]Bread and Fred.
[00:10.57]Mm-hmm.
[00:16.95]I'm turning volume down.
[00:18.05]I'm glad I did because the splash screen is very loud.
[00:21.67]Yep.
[00:22.15]Oh, yeah.
[00:22.61]Turn your volume down.
[00:23.30]I'm glad I caught that.
[00:27.50]It's very loud.
[00:36.01]Uh, should I play this with a controller?
[00:38.61]I don't know, I was just thinking the same.
[00:47.67]I don't know where I put my controller.
[00:49.67]Jesus, what the f***?
[00:50.15]What the f***?
[00:51.93]I'm trying to turn it down and it went up.
[00:53.87]What just happened?
[00:54.62]Hold on a second.
[01:05.40]Hey, I got... I got a limiter on everything that comes through.
[01:10.45]Don't worry.
[01:11.69]I have a limiter on everything that comes through now.
[01:14.11]So that was loud, but that wasn't unbelievably loud.
[01:17.19]Don't worry.
[01:18.03]I put it on there.
[01:18.63]Alright, how you feel?
[01:23.46]I feel... Hey, how you doing there?
[01:25.90]Hey, pal.
[01:27.24]What's going on there, pal?
[01:28.60]Hold on.
[01:29.62]What resolution are you playing at?
[01:32.30]What do you... What do you... What?
[01:33.60]What?
[01:34.69]What resolution are we playing at?
[01:35.79]Yes.
[01:35.87]You can do five?
[01:36.41]What is 5120 by 2160?
[01:36.77]What the hell is that?
[01:37.43]A projector?
[01:37.71]5K resolution.
[01:38.11]Alright, let me capture this.
[02:08.56]Hey, there it is.
[02:15.44]Okay, this game is Torturous Chat.
[02:17.38]It's a co-op platformer where we're tied together.
[02:19.62]I haven't played it, haven't seen it played, but I know that it is going to require coordination between me and you to succeed.
[02:27.49]So it is going to be torture.
[02:30.53]Okay.
[02:31.65]So how do we get in a game together?
[02:33.23]You click play and then it says multiplayer.
[02:37.03]Multiplayer.
[02:39.09]OK, should I?
[02:40.49]Do you want to host?
[02:41.01]You want me to host it?
[02:42.55]I'll host again.
[02:43.11]Make sure there's not like a room code before we show it.
[02:48.19]My screen is hidden.
[02:50.15]There's no room code.
[02:50.93]It's a Steam invite.
[02:52.76]I've sent you the Steam invite.
[02:54.44]Yeah.
[02:56.18]Alright, we good.
[02:58.68]There's no like.
[02:59.32]Oh, there we go.
[02:59.84]OK.
[03:06.19]Waiting for your partner.
[03:06.99]Yeah, you gotta press space to confirm for some reason.
[03:10.97]Oh, so I'm Fred.
[03:12.89]You're Fred.
[03:13.43]I'm bread.
[03:14.31]Is a mod here.
[03:15.35]Can they change the game to bread and Fred?
[03:18.79]Hey, can that mod come over to my channel and do the same?
[03:23.01]Don't do that.
[03:25.85]OK, so how does it work?
[03:28.85]I'm going to plug a controller in for sure.
[03:31.08]OK, so I'm the red one and.
[03:34.66]How do you move?
[03:37.35]WASD is working for me it's it's arrow keys for me oh numpad with your with your coffee I'm using controller uh do you know what a fulcrum is yes
[04:06.20]Oh, you played Q?
[04:08.78]Why is WASD not working?
[04:10.20]And this control will not work either for this game?
[04:15.00]Everything's fine for me.
[04:16.14]What the heck?
[04:17.04]That's weird.
[04:19.28]I guess I'm doing arrow keys?
[04:21.86]Is it that hard?
[04:23.10]No, it's fine.
[04:23.56]Is it that difficult?
[04:24.60]It's fine.
[04:28.62]Our ping is at the top.
[04:29.70]It's funny.
[04:31.89]So it's just jump and walk.
[04:33.79]Is there any other buttons?
[04:35.69]Not that I've noticed.
[04:37.69]I don't know what this is.
[04:38.53]Oh, I think this is where you get your collectibles or something.
[04:45.57]Oh, we got it.
[04:46.34]We got to go climb the mountain.
[04:48.22]How did you just do that?
[04:50.20]Do what?
[04:50.84]You were like holding on.
[04:52.64]We're always holding on.
[04:54.04]Alright, well, get up here.
[04:56.94]We have to time this, by the way.
[04:58.32]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[04:59.86]This is going to be torture.
[05:03.09]From there, can I pull you up?
[05:06.27]It does not appear so.
[05:11.21]Okay, so one, two.
[05:12.65]No, no, no, don't just do that.
[05:13.75]Are we going to have to count down for every jump?
[05:16.53]Yes, that's how it works.
[05:18.24]Ready?
[05:18.46]Do you want to go like...
[05:22.22]Go.
[05:22.72]Or do you want it to be like one, two, three?
[05:24.84]How do you want to do this?
[05:27.36]Uno, dos, tres.
[05:29.32]Okay, so you want... We have to get the same thing.
[05:31.26]Ready?
[05:33.12]Uno, dos, tres.
[05:35.11]On three.
[05:36.87]Oh, I can swing.
[05:39.43]Uno, dos, tres.
[05:41.41]Uno, dos, tres.
[05:43.65]Okay, only one of us should do it.
[05:46.17]We need something better than that.
[05:49.13]I'm telling you.
[05:52.38]uh I I say what we're gonna do is now jump and on jump no no no no because if you do one two three then you're adding 33 more gameplay time yeah but if we if it just simply just is now jump now jump see now jump can I swing you up here maybe
[06:21.04]Alright.
[06:22.05]Just one, two, three.
[06:23.13]No comedy dog shit.
[06:25.23]One, two, three.
[06:26.95]One, two, three.
[06:29.43]One, two, three.
[06:30.09]One, two, three.
[06:30.94]Oh, it's Charlie.
[06:36.06]Review some of the key points.
[06:37.36]The most important one is swinging.
[06:40.04]One of you needs to be an anchor.
[06:41.93]S2.
[06:42.07]That doesn't even work for me.
[06:44.81]Okay, so it's down.
[06:45.53]Yeah, down.
[06:46.67]And then you swing.
[06:48.11]Okay.
[06:51.54]Okay.
[06:53.88]Don't fall.
[06:55.94]Okay, so let's go up here.
[06:57.20]Let's test that out.
[06:57.94]So I'm going to... Come over here.
[07:01.12]One, two, three.
[07:02.78]So I'm going to anchor and then you go down.
[07:04.79]What happens if I do that?
[07:06.55]So you can swing and get yourself up here.
[07:12.95]I think at some point...
[07:15.37]Oh, if I let go, we go flying.
[07:16.33]You need to stand up, and then we need to both... We're not getting past, like, the first jump.
[07:24.03]There's no way.
[07:24.35]It smells like shit in this room.
[07:26.71]Fucking coffee.
[07:28.63]Anchor!
[07:29.35]Alright!
[07:33.38]Okay, now we need to both jump here.
[07:35.38]Alright.
[07:37.30]One, two, three.
[07:38.80]One, two, three.
[07:41.14]Okay, here.
[07:41.80]I'm gonna anchor.
[07:42.50]You're gonna swing.
[07:47.35]And then when you're coming back... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[07:52.70]Okay.
[07:54.30]I'm going to go for it.
[07:57.84]Okay, apparently you need to go more up.
[08:03.24]One, two, three.
[08:05.04]One, two, three.
[08:07.38]Okay, I'm anchoring now.
[08:08.64]So when you go up there, I jump.
[08:11.44]When I'm swinging... Like that.
[08:13.04]Let's go, let's go.
[08:19.82]Alright, you just kind of, I'm going to anchor and you fling yourself up.
[08:22.22]I can't, I can't here.
[08:24.04]You got to move, you got to move.
[08:25.40]No, Jerma, come down.
[08:26.22]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[08:27.62]We can both make this jump without an anchor.
[08:29.70]We have to practice the anchor because it's going to be, there's going to be a jump up here we're going to lose.
[08:32.40]See?
[08:34.62]Hold on, it's, I, I, one, two.
[08:40.50]What are you doing?
[08:41.30]Don't kind of like, alright.
[08:43.80]One, two, three.
[08:45.12]You have to keep the same timing the whole time.
[08:47.42]One, two, three.
[08:49.68]yeah oh can you no I can kind of like pull you oh you have to make the jump okay you need to swing more than that so bad at this we need to count
[09:15.06]You don't just sense me.
[09:16.26]We're not like close enough that we can just sense.
[09:19.16]One, two, three.
[09:21.56]One, two, three.
[09:25.03]Anchor.
[09:25.89]Go for it.
[09:26.45]I'll do the jump.
[09:31.13]Okay.
[09:32.57]What?
[09:33.35]I don't know, but just swing.
[09:37.04]I can't.
[09:37.80]Why did my forehead get so much bigger?
[09:40.54]I don't know.
[09:41.18]Did we break it?
[09:42.26]That...
[09:43.56]Alright, alright, alright.
[09:44.28]No, no, no.
[09:44.54]It's alright.
[09:45.70]So now, if you swing, you can... Oh, there we go.
[09:52.10]Alright.
[09:52.98]One, two, three.
[09:54.40]One, two, three.
[09:57.63]Don't just jump without counting.
[10:00.09]Well, I'm getting anchored.
[10:01.17]We don't need the... I got you.
[10:04.91]okay and you can pull me up okay ready one two three one two three alright you just have to be ready to do the jump I'm not good at this yet there you go alright stop no don't don't freak out because we have to get through the tutorial okay that's our child ready how do we get up there I think we have to just jump okay one two three oh yeah alright we got it we're getting there
[10:34.52]What a challenge you're undertaking.
[10:35.98]Enjoy the trip.
[10:38.76]They aren't coming back.
[10:41.91]That's ominous.
[10:43.29]I don't know why.
[10:45.39]Wait, don't just jump.
[10:46.47]I know you're like a fast gamer.
[10:48.31]You like to go really quickly, but we can't do that here.
[10:51.45]One.
[10:55.35]Two.
[10:58.50]Three.
[11:00.12]That's funny.
[11:00.72]Alright.
[11:01.66]One, two, three.
[11:04.24]one two three alright that's wait wait hold on we need the momentum and the jump that's a lot that's a big gap there's a countdown button what is it I'm going the options you are controlling my video game right now am I yeah
[11:37.37]I don't, I don't have... Don't, dude, are you going to go like change my resolution?
[11:42.95]I got clap.
[11:45.54]We got clap.
[11:46.40]We got pull the rope with jump.
[11:51.82]Grab object with E. I don't think I can do that, by the way.
[11:58.41]Rock, paper, scissors.
[11:59.83]Well, this is yours.
[12:00.77]This is player two.
[12:01.83]Yeah, but I... Wait, now I can do WASD.
[12:06.05]That's weird.
[12:07.11]Because... This is weird.
[12:10.31]This is weird.
[12:10.83]This is like a Hamachi gameplay.
[12:12.39]Like we're on a land, but not really.
[12:15.07]So look at your controls.
[12:16.22]Grab is control.
[12:18.20]Grab is E for me.
[12:22.90]Four is countdown.
[12:24.68]What?
[12:29.30]I think what it's saying now is you.
[12:31.64]Countdown is four, but you... Alright, get out of this menu for a second.
[12:36.65]I... I... W, A, C does not work.
[12:41.87]Okay, hold on.
[12:42.69]But can I do that, though?
[12:45.26]I cannot do a countdown.
[12:47.84]If I go... I can't even hit escape, dude.
[12:49.70]I literally have no control of my own game.
[12:54.34]You're... Okay, so this is really weird.
[12:57.28]Go... Can you go to my settings?
[12:58.78]Your countdown is numlock 4.
[13:01.22]What the fuck?
[13:03.89]Okay, so... That's hard to do, though.
[13:09.03]How come I can't just have the same controls as you?
[13:10.43]I don't know.
[13:12.37]Why can't we just say it out loud?
[13:13.37]Alright, let's go.
[13:16.37]Ready?
[13:16.51]Okay, I think you need to move over.
[13:18.67]Do you want me to anchor?
[13:20.18]No, no, no.
[13:20.58]Let's.
[13:21.32]Because if I swing, then I... Brother!
[13:28.52]What I'm saying is when you're that close, I just end up standing.
[13:31.12]I know, but we... Alright, you ready?
[13:36.40]That's not going to help me.
[13:38.02]Okay, wait, wait.
[13:38.76]Let me do the other direction.
[13:39.66]Let me get that.
[13:40.24]Okay, you ready?
[13:43.90]No.
[13:44.34]No!
[13:46.06]Are you alright?
[13:49.37]Oh, shit.
[13:49.87]I killed him.
[13:59.55]Okay, can you hit escape for me?
[14:01.37]Because I don't know how to get to my menu.
[14:04.42]I now go to options now go to like controls now go to me like fred player two select like my tab at the top I did okay control grab object save checkpoint pull rope is shift countdown is four that's not what it's gonna be
[14:30.87]like it's the n4 is num lock yeah no no no no wait this is being changed uh this is gonna be press game pad can it be right control wait there is a gigantic game pad at the top oh thank god oh yes okay
[14:55.73]Left, right, jump, anchor, grab is left trigger, left bumper, pull rope is B. Alright, let's go.
[15:04.89]You can get me out of here now.
[15:11.22]It didn't do anything.
[15:23.54]Do I have to select it for you?
[15:25.26]I don't know.
[15:27.15]Press left on the D-pad.
[15:31.55]It's weirdly enough, I don't have any control of any of this.
[15:35.61]Now I do.
[15:36.41]Like I can control this now.
[15:37.80]So if I go to Fred player two, it says game pad.
[15:42.02]Yes.
[15:42.32]Is there like a yes button?
[15:43.80]Like an accept button?
[15:44.80]No, I think what chat isn't understanding is when I go into the options, it is changing what your options are.
[15:51.95]Yeah.
[15:52.91]And we're on the internet.
[15:55.15]This is, okay.
[15:55.65]So if I select gamepad, I have to connect a controller, but it works for him, but I don't have a controller connected.
[16:01.83]Okay, but hold on a second.
[16:02.51]We can't have the same inputs on keyboard.
[16:07.15]So this is working for me.
[16:08.51]I'm using my controller right now.
[16:09.73]So if I hit back, back, back, I have no control anymore and it doesn't work.
[16:18.00]And now I have no control.
[16:21.67]I'm just going to use a fucking... Wait, nothing works now.
[16:30.04]Don't click that.
[16:35.33]So we had another backup game.
[16:37.41]No, this is fun.
[16:38.49]This is really fun.
[16:39.29]Alright, should we just restart the game?
[16:50.75]Alright, just get us out of this.
[16:52.47]Like, this... Can you, like, jump off or something and pull us down?
[16:56.49]Exit to main menu.
[16:57.33]Alright, now wait.
[16:59.01]Can you set up your options before we play?
[17:01.01]Okay, set up your options before we do anything.
[17:03.67]I have access.
[17:04.49]I can use my controller.
[17:05.99]Options.
[17:07.61]Controls.
[17:09.61]Gamepad.
[17:11.07]I'm player two.
[17:12.69]This is... It works.
[17:13.81]It's working right now.
[17:14.77]This works right now.
[17:16.63]Okay.
[17:17.35]Okay.
[17:17.95]I... I...
[17:20.80]Let's just check it again.
[17:21.46]I'm gonna put them both on the gamepad?
[17:26.99]No, wait, would that fuck up for you?
[17:28.33]Okay, if I'm Fred... I have no idea.
[17:30.33]I mean, it works right now.
[17:33.17]Alright, so invite me.
[17:42.37]Put it on both?
[17:42.87]Yeah, my chat's saying you can't play on a gamepad.
[17:45.97]You would just have to use different keyboard controls.
[17:48.29]What?
[17:52.23]Okay, well then we're just going to have to do that.
[17:55.59]That is pretty wild.
[17:56.35]I'm fine with the arrow keys.
[17:59.58]You either both have to be keyboard or both gamepad.
[18:01.72]You can't mix it.
[18:02.56]So do you have a gamepad?
[18:04.46]I don't know where it is.
[18:06.40]Let's just go.
[18:07.64]We were doing fine.
[18:12.91]That's bizarre.
[18:13.99]Okay.
[18:15.73]I'm ready for an invite.
[18:16.71]Do you want an invite?
[18:18.71]I sent it.
[18:19.89]And now I can't.
[18:21.13]Wait a minute.
[18:23.71]I'm so confused.
[18:24.67]The whole premise of this game is co-op and it doesn't... Okay.
[18:31.05]You're bread.
[18:31.97]I'm Fred.
[18:32.43]Okay.
[18:42.54]Are we good?
[18:44.48]Are we?
[18:44.84]You can move?
[18:45.90]I can move.
[18:46.78]You know what your grab button is?
[18:47.98]Because it looks like grabbing walls is also important.
[18:50.10]Grab is control for me, I believe.
[18:52.42]Okay.
[18:53.75]Grab the wall.
[18:56.91]Maybe not.
[18:57.85]Is it the number pad control that's up there?
[19:00.41]Hold on.
[19:03.05]Can you go look at my controls for me?
[19:09.96]Okay, hold on.
[19:10.62]Red 2.
[19:11.16]You just do it.
[19:16.45]It's weird because when I'm looking at Fred too, it switches the controls for you.
[19:20.44]No, that's got to be left control.
[19:22.66]I can change it for you.
[19:24.42]I can do it too.
[19:25.94]Grab object.
[19:27.10]I want it to be shift.
[19:29.66]Pull rope.
[19:30.60]Right shift.

[20:47.37]Okay.
[20:48.53]What do we do here?

[20:57.95]Oh, we just jumped.
[20:58.73]There we go.

[21:21.14]I'm just going on that.
[21:21.92]Okay, you ready?
[21:26.10]I'm ready.

[22:00.81]Okay, ready?
[22:04.49]I'm going... Wait, hold on.
[22:07.03]I'm going too far.
[22:10.29]Okay, I'm going on the next one.
[22:15.43]Up.
[22:16.25]Up.
[22:16.87]Alright.
[22:20.99]I forgot to remind you, one more thing.
[22:23.07]Sorry guys, my bad.
[22:24.01]Okay.
[22:24.97]Okay.
[22:25.07]Okay.
[22:25.19]So what's the deal here?
[22:26.47]It shows us in the picture.
[22:28.03]Do you want to grab it or do you want me to do it?
[22:41.15]Uh, I'm gonna grab... No!
[22:44.25]You... Why would... I don't know.
[22:46.71]You freaked me out.
[22:47.63]You did the one, two, three, go.
[22:48.85]One, two, three, go means we go.
[22:50.61]We both go.
[22:51.49]I don't think I could jump and reach the wall unless we both jumped up.
[22:55.46]I don't know why you jumped forward.
[22:56.74]I saw the one, two, three, and I'm like, I have to go.
[22:59.28]He's doing it.
[22:59.78]I'm gonna be very clear.
[23:07.09]I'm gonna be very deliberate.
[23:08.33]I'm gonna give hand...
[23:11.15]written instructions I'm going on this one you can do it for sure brother oh brother you can't you just gotta stand you gotta stay up there and you keep doing your little joke pull me up you're either what do you mean my little joke
[23:41.08]We don't even need the timing for that one.
[23:48.48]Alright.
[23:48.82]It's actually kind of hard to do this.
[23:49.82]You ready?
[23:52.14]So when you get the momentum, you do the jump.
[23:56.03]You're not getting a lot of it.
[23:59.05]You jumped at the wrong time.
[24:00.75]You're not getting momentum like I get momentum.
[24:03.27]You're a dead weight.
[24:04.91]I had plenty of momentum.
[24:08.38]You're not.
[24:09.48]You're an anchor.
[24:13.72]There's not much more momentum I can give you.
[24:16.84]You weren't doing that before.
[24:18.74]You see how you can't get up there unless I jump with you?
[24:23.04]So give me a countdown.
[24:23.84]Let's go.
[24:33.52]Why are you trying to mess me up?
[24:40.14]I'm connected to you.
[24:42.73]You're the anchor.
[24:43.77]Yes.
[24:49.45]Next one.
[24:51.73]Nice.
[24:57.70]Okay.
[24:58.30]Alright.
[24:58.56]So what I'm saying here is we need to both jump straight up at the same time.
[25:02.86]Then you grab the wall.
[25:04.92]I grab the wall.
[25:07.02]Yes.
[25:07.84]Okay.
[25:08.04]We're jumping up, not forward.
[25:09.84]Yes, I know.
[25:18.77]I'm hitting the, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta let go.
[25:21.50]Yeah, you gotta get higher.
[25:25.22]Okay.
[25:34.53]Look at us.
[25:34.81]There we go.
[25:35.47]Look at that.
[25:35.89]Look at that.
[25:37.01]Alright, are we going to the right or are we going up here?
[25:39.65]Uh, we're going to jump to the right.
[25:43.58]Got it.
[25:47.37]Men.
[25:47.71]Now what?
[25:50.51]The same thing on this left wall.
[25:52.63]You're going to grab the left wall.
[25:54.03]Yep.
[25:54.75]And then I'm going to swing up.
[25:57.43]You're going to grab it.
[26:00.65]I just pressed the button.
[26:01.47]It must have been a lag.
[26:02.09]It's just a bad program.
[26:08.58]Alright.
[26:11.30]How are you?
[26:11.56]Are you sweating?
[26:13.16]I'm... Oh, that was fun.
[26:15.74]What's the next game?
[26:18.44]Oh, you're not pulling out.
[26:19.16]You're not pulling out right now.
[26:20.34]You're not pulling out right now.
[26:22.62]You ready?
[26:27.88]Okay.
[26:29.90]This is just Jump King with two people.
[26:32.58]Yeah.
[26:33.86]I never even played Jump King.
[26:36.78]Don't.
[26:37.48]You'll be very upset at yourself for like a week.
[26:39.54]But we're doing that, but worse.
[26:42.46]Um, we're at 40.
[26:43.86]Three, two, one.
[26:45.04]Alright.
[26:47.19]Am I anchoring?
[26:50.64]Yeah.
[26:57.28]Okay, I'm going to wait a second here because this is important to make this.
[27:02.09]Yeah, just do that.
[27:03.51]Ready?
[27:06.51]Got it?
[27:06.85]Great.
[27:07.11]Achievement up here.
[27:09.27]Oh, look at that cute little baby.
[27:17.47]Our baby.
[27:19.76]That we had together.
[27:26.62]Okay, you see what's going on here.
[27:28.77]Okay, I do, but I don't.
[27:30.45]I need to grab.
[27:31.25]Who do you want me to grab?
[27:33.59]No, I'll grab.
[27:34.23]It better not be a lag.
[27:36.59]Can you grab?
[27:38.31]I'm going to try.
[27:39.07]Okay.
[27:39.95]Give me the timer.
[27:42.21]Okay.
[27:47.92]Okay.
[27:49.64]what wait that makes logical that does make logical sense I think you need to as you're doing it you need to grab you need to grab that I need to grab on the other side we're not in a bad position no it's just it's stressful because there's a timer of how long you can hold on wait a second this is a different route
[28:17.06]Okay, if we mess this up, we have to do everything again.
[28:19.92]I know, and I know you hate this.
[28:21.82]You hate more than anything, like, having to do the thing over again, which is why you never play these games.
[28:28.58]Up.
[28:29.28]Up.
[28:29.60]You always anchor.
[28:30.48]Up.
[28:30.68]Yeah, because I need to anchor, otherwise we'll fall.
[28:32.80]No, you pull up, and then I pull.
[28:35.50]I pull up.
[28:36.08]I pull.
[28:36.52]You pull up.
[28:37.38]You anchor down.
[28:39.02]That was weird what you just did.
[28:40.84]Hold on.
[28:42.04]Thank you.
[28:44.33]Okay.
[28:44.97]Now, wait a minute.
[28:46.87]I'm going to grab the first one and then you're going to swing up to the wall on the other side and grab it.
[28:51.79]And then you're going to swing and we're going to swing over there.
[28:53.89]Yes.
[28:54.47]You got it.
[29:11.50]Oh, I'm good.
[29:12.64]Ready?
[29:12.92]A little more, a little more, a little more.
[29:15.72]More?
[29:17.28]Uh, okay, ready?
[29:17.92]On this one, on this one.
[29:18.74]Oh, we had it.
[29:21.78]Okay, we got it.
[29:22.70]We got it.
[29:22.94]We got it.
[29:23.39]We got it.
[29:23.63]We got it.
[29:27.47]We got it.
[29:27.77]We got it.
[29:28.01]We got it.
[29:28.35]We can do it.
[29:33.81]What the fuck?
[29:34.58]I was anchored.
[29:35.60]You were.
[29:41.78]Anchor.
[29:46.06]Okay, I'm going on this one.
[29:50.71]Okay.
[29:56.27]Alright, let's go over the plan again.
[29:59.45]I grab the wall first.
[30:00.53]You grab, then I grab, and then... What happened there, though?
[30:03.31]I feel like we did that pretty well.
[30:05.61]I think you might have just let go at a weird angle, and then we didn't launch up.
[30:10.97]We kind of launched very... True.
[30:13.35]Alright.
[30:14.87]We got this.
[30:26.90]I'm going to go on this one.
[30:36.04]I don't know.
[30:36.76]I don't know.
[30:40.20]It was too late.
[30:42.78]I feel like the first one was too early.
[30:44.50]That one must have been too late.
[30:48.53]Not enough momentum.
[30:57.59]I'm gonna go on this one.
[30:59.57]Woo!
[31:00.29]Good thing I pulled you.
[31:01.17]Okay.
[31:09.41]Alright, buddy.
[31:16.16]Okay.
[31:21.22]I'm gonna go on the next one.
[31:24.91]You're doing it too late.
[31:25.77]Is it really though?
[31:28.23]I thought that was good.
[31:29.26]My momentum is going up, not left by the time you let go.
[31:37.08]I'm so concerned that it's not going to be enough.
[31:42.27]Going on, not this one.
[31:44.77]Is he going the wrong way?
[31:49.25]Okay, going on this one.
[31:51.37]No.
[31:52.32]It's hard.
[31:52.84]It's hard.
[31:54.02]There we go.
[31:54.94]Okay.
[31:55.82]I'm just going to go on whenever I can.
[32:03.76]Is that enough?
[32:18.73]Okay.
[32:20.31]Go one.
[32:21.43]This one.
[32:23.91]Oh, yes.
[32:25.01]Oh.
[32:26.00]Oh, just bring yourself up.

[32:29.32]High five.
[32:29.72]High five there.
[32:31.34]No, don't jump.
[32:32.24]Don't jump.
[32:32.97]False.
[32:33.23]False.
[32:33.57]Okay.

[33:21.23]I think you can get up here.
[33:22.44]Yeah.
[33:23.52]Alright.
[33:26.00]Stop swinging.
[33:27.04]Stop swinging for one second.
[33:32.24]Let's pull on mine.

[33:53.81]Bro!
[33:55.27]What are you doing?
[33:56.75]We're going to the top.
[33:57.47]Good luck, guys.

[34:04.67]Probably.
[34:05.03]Wait, he said watch out.
[34:09.78]Hold on.
[34:10.02]He said watch out.
[34:11.92]What does it say?
[34:18.60]you already have that chat is here that's true alright simple we almost didn't make that alright you want me to anchor that yeah that's big this is a lot but and we can overshoot this too so um gg I'm gonna go I'm just gonna pick a good time

[34:45.80]Oh, GG.
[34:47.82]What is this hook?
[34:49.60]I don't know.
[34:49.90]Do you want to try and grab it?
[34:51.82]Jump up and grab it?
[34:52.76]Yeah.
[34:55.20]I think we're too far.
[35:03.04]That's bait.
[35:03.63]I don't want... It's a picture.
[35:06.21]No one cares.
[35:10.59]Oi!
[35:11.81]That was bait.
[35:12.97]Was it?
[35:14.44]It was all bait.
[35:15.08]Everything was bait.
[35:15.62]The whole thing was bait.
[35:16.32]What do you mean?
[35:17.82]I'm bait.
[35:18.46]You're bait.
[35:19.72]Oh, boy.
[35:20.24]We're falling apart.
[35:20.80]Hold on.
[35:21.58]You didn't anchor.
[35:22.16]You didn't anchor.
[35:23.24]You didn't anchor.
[35:24.14]I didn't anchor.
[35:26.62]You didn't anchor.
[35:28.36]Oh.
[35:28.72]It's alright.
[35:31.70]Let's speed run.
[35:40.32]You can help.
[35:45.34]Let's be wrong.
[35:45.80]Nothing's gonna go wrong.
[35:46.50]I want.
[36:02.60]I don't OK.
[36:11.65]Just pull me up.
[36:12.11]We can do it.
[36:13.01]We got baited.
[36:13.63]It's fine.
[36:14.03]Just pull me up.
[36:16.93]Speedrun.
[36:18.97]We should not even need to communicate for these ones.
[36:21.30]Yeah.
[36:21.54]We've done them so many times.
[36:27.10]Can I pull you from here?
[36:31.35]Fuck.
[36:32.23]Um...
[36:37.22]okay no communication right now okay no communication silence I want silence and I want you to fucking go ready put both your headphones in if they're not in I know mine weren't ready we're just going yeah that's not a jump we can make
[37:13.43]Are we still communicating?
[37:14.25]Let go.
[37:16.45]Let go.
[37:19.77]Okay.
[37:23.71]My fingers were sweaty.
[37:25.27]Alright.
[37:29.85]Let's... Dude, this game is like, hey, play this game with your friend and see, like, try each other's patience and is it your real friend?
[37:41.70]This book is all over me.
[37:53.68]Alright.
[37:54.40]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[37:55.04]Let's just do it the right way.
[37:57.31]Why?
[37:58.91]You said what?
[37:59.99]What did you just say?
[38:01.99]You're fine.
[38:03.55]I can.
[38:03.89]Yeah, we're good.
[38:05.33]Now I'm just going to go like this.
[38:08.63]Okay.
[38:17.14]Oh, let's see who your true friends are.
[38:22.76]We're incapable of jumping unless I do a full 360.
[38:26.09]I had to look at my keyboard.
[38:31.41]I didn't know what fucking Z was.
[38:32.43]Okay, ready?
[38:37.92]I'm grabbing.
[38:38.52]Yes.
[38:38.72]I can just pull you up.
[38:50.02]Oh, buddy boy.
[38:51.33]Oh, buddy boy.
[38:55.03]You're trying to do something evil.
[38:57.44]No, no, no.
[38:58.24]You just went at the wrong time.
[38:59.52]Play it back at times minus 10 speed.
[39:19.64]You're trolling.
[39:20.58]I'm very concerned about you.
[39:22.60]Don't be.
[39:23.10]I want to win just as much as you do.
[39:26.83]Truthfully, I don't want to.
[39:29.65]I suspect that the cost of winning is too high.
[39:35.54]On the next one.
[39:43.78]Okay.
[39:44.32]You grab, then I grab.
[39:55.93]Going on the next one.
[39:57.93]That was not fast enough.
[40:01.54]Jesus Christ.
[40:05.08]Alright, you grab.
[40:16.81]Very nice.
[40:22.75]Oh, I had a lag.
[40:27.39]Alright, we need to take this one slow because this is the hard one.
[40:32.43]This jump is the hard jump.
[40:34.20]Do we... Okay.
[40:35.30]Okay.
[40:36.76]Right here, you think?
[40:37.62]Right here?
[40:37.92]Right in the middle or further up?
[40:40.98]You're good.
[40:42.58]You need to be going full revolutions like crazy.
[40:45.81]I am aware that you need a full revolution, man.
[40:53.22]There it is.
[40:54.02]Alright, come on.
[40:54.64]We can do this one.
[40:55.56]Can we look down?
[40:56.99]Like, what is going on here?
[40:58.27]I don't know.
[40:58.69]Because that next jump felt impossible.
[41:00.69]It did.
[41:02.53]Unless we have to swing.
[41:04.05]We might have to do a big swing jump.
[41:09.31]Well, let's just get over here.
[41:09.93]What is with this hook?
[41:10.61]What is with the hook?
[41:11.30]There's... I don't think we can get it, though.
[41:13.48]Okay.
[41:20.08]Okay.
[41:21.02]What do we do?
[41:24.40]There's no way.
[41:25.36]Is there no way?
[41:27.38]But it has to be.
[41:28.40]That's pointing.
[41:29.16]It's pointing there.
[41:29.88]Wait, we can save the game.
[41:33.08]How?
[41:33.76]I don't know.
[41:34.06]Is it save states?
[41:35.12]Some people are saying save, save, save states, save states.
[41:37.20]What are you doing?
[41:39.51]If you get the item, it will give you save states.
[41:44.75]You want to just use one here?
[41:45.73]We already have one.
[41:48.49]Well, I don't know.
[41:49.19]I don't know what they're talking about.
[41:50.17]I don't know.
[41:50.65]How do we use it?
[41:51.51]I think it was like one of the F keys.
[41:53.20]Maybe.
[41:53.40]Maybe.
[41:57.54]it a lie save checkpoint yeah yeah yeah we use it I can't do it so I guess maybe we do have to get this alright what if we just drop down we're getting one guide are we it's assist options it's under assist options oh so it's if you're bad
[42:23.26]but I know this is your least favorite game in the world you don't like to have to start completely over at zero and do it all over again you hate that don't you I do you do well it depends look we're just gonna do it right okay you ready we're just gonna do it right why did you do that why would you do that

[42:50.21]Yes.
[42:51.07]All the way.
[42:51.53]You're going to have to pull me up.
[43:01.40]Why don't we do a running jump on this one?
[43:03.42]Like run at the same time?
[43:06.42]Oh, his brain is exploding.
[43:07.78]Okay.
[43:09.10]Okay.
[43:09.58]The go, the three, two, one go is going to be to start running.
[43:12.34]And then once you hit the edge, just jump.
[43:14.14]Okay.
[43:14.40]Alright.
[43:14.78]Yeah, I get it.
[43:15.28]I get it.
[43:15.60]I get it.
[43:15.92]Okay.
[43:16.08]Okay.
[43:22.37]oh we actually did it damn that was a good call you could just let me hang because we gotta we gotta do another jump here right but this is gonna be horrible or or we're all the way back at the beginning and notice this is okay we're just gonna do the full rotation this is a big jump old rotation trying to get it trying to get it in the right direction okay
[43:48.59]You got it.
[43:49.43]You got it.
[43:50.13]Nice.
[43:50.95]Okay, we're good.
[43:52.64]So now we're at a... Okay, let's not freak out.
[43:55.14]Hands off the keyboard for a second.
[43:56.42]Wipe your hands.
[43:56.88]My hands are getting sweaty.
[43:59.06]Yep.
[43:59.74]Okay, so I think we have to go either up or down.
[44:01.66]I don't know which one is the right one.
[44:03.12]Up.
[44:03.60]It's pointing up.
[44:04.16]I don't know what that basket is.
[44:10.71]Maybe there is like an NPC or something down there.
[44:13.93]Here, dangle me.
[44:16.74]I can't see.
[44:17.38]I'm blind.
[44:18.90]I can't see anything.
[44:20.64]There's a hoop down there, right?
[44:21.92]It's like a net.
[44:23.24]Yeah, let's go down there.
[44:24.36]Should we?
[44:24.76]I feel like this is scary.
[44:26.53]It'll be easy to get back up.
[44:28.29]Oh, it's just a hoop.
[44:30.15]Okay, what if I throw you in that?
[44:31.31]Can we like do that?
[44:31.95]I mean, we could swing off the top if we wanted to put someone in the hoop, but why?
[44:41.33]I feel like it's the game is saying, hey, there's a hoop here.
[44:43.52]You should get dunked in the hoop.
[44:54.80]Do you want to get dunked in the hoop?
[44:56.16]I mean, we could try it.
[44:57.12]You want to just dangle and I'll just let go?
[44:59.41]Let's jump across and I'll grab that wall and dangle you into it.
[45:02.11]Okay.
[45:04.99]Go.
[45:07.33]So you're going to have to let go.
[45:12.75]That was fun.
[45:13.87]That was great.
[45:14.87]Hey, we did it.
[45:15.23]That's fantastic.
[45:16.95]Wait, maybe I have to grab it.
[45:19.75]How do you do the pull up?
[45:21.41]For me, it was Z. It's a very specific key you have to have it be.
[45:35.24]What is the key for you?
[45:37.06]Q. Alright, let's just go up.
[45:43.46]They took that as a signal.
[45:47.28]Hey, I'm not going to make the mistake.
[45:49.54]Because I know that you'll be like, look what you did and you're so bad at games.
[45:53.18]Oh, look at you.
[45:56.18]Now what?
[45:57.50]We got to slingshot someone at that wall.
[46:00.54]Oh, God.
[46:01.24]Okay.
[46:02.00]I'm going to throw you at it.
[46:08.43]I think we need a full revolution.
[46:13.97]I got it.
[46:15.26]Good.
[46:16.20]Now you grab that one.
[46:16.92]We got to grab the other side.
[46:18.42]Yep.
[46:20.62]I need a little bit of slack.
[46:22.86]Okay.
[46:23.84]And you're going to have to let go when I'm in the right spot.
[46:26.23]Nice job.
[46:27.23]And that's how we get up here.
[46:28.35]That's how we get up to 70 fucking too.
[46:31.27]Don't blow it here.
[46:36.96]Alright.
[46:38.21]Ready?
[46:38.39]Okay.
[46:41.61]You need more room?
[46:43.31]No.
[46:51.13]Okay.
[46:54.62]Hold on.
[46:57.04]Swing.
[47:00.04]For what?
[47:01.02]I'm telling you.
[47:01.52]Swing.
[47:01.84]Swing.
[47:02.66]Full swing.
[47:04.00]I can't full swing because there's a wall.
[47:06.26]We're good.
[47:08.20]So we didn't drop all the way down.
[47:11.52]This is the one we have to run at, right?
[47:15.63]Yep.
[47:23.40]You know what?
[47:24.28]Are you confident in this or do you want me to do it?
[47:27.02]We're going to maintain our roles.
[47:30.24]We're not goofing around.
[47:31.70]Okay.
[47:41.22]Good.
[47:48.08]Rolls maintained.
[47:49.34]Stare.
[47:50.04]No goofing.
[47:51.10]Stare.
[47:53.06]No goofing.
[47:56.52]Was that a goof?
[47:57.30]You goofing right now?
[47:58.18]Are you seriously goofing when we're about to do the big jumps for the big boys?
[48:01.38]Alright.
[48:04.93]Same deal.
[48:05.99]I might actually have to grab this, though.
[48:08.43]I mean, whoever can grab it, grab it.
[48:10.19]Yep.
[48:26.24]uh you have your mouse on your screen apparently somebody came over to my chat to tell me that oh no is he okay I need to do cpr oh twerk it twerk it
[48:48.28]Alright, you want to climb the mountain again?
[48:50.20]Kind of.
[48:59.57]Shit, no, we gotta go back.
[49:06.36]Sorry.
[49:20.51]I feel like this three, two, one, go finding out that there's a pleasant beep, beep, beep, beep.
[49:25.64]It's just like activating, like neurons are firing in your brain, like unparalleled.
[49:31.70]So we have to keep going.
[49:34.44]When you hear the boom, you're like, you're just ready to jump.
[49:36.64]I gotta jump.
[49:37.00]I gotta jump.
[49:37.60]I gotta jump.
[49:38.22]It's like the Mario cart thing.
[49:39.26]It's like when you, and you've like fucking eyes, your pupils just go fucking wide.
[49:52.36]Or is it like a rat in a Skinner box?
[49:55.59]You've been conditioned.
[49:56.87]I'm grabbing it.
[50:00.69]Okay.
[50:01.35]Wait, no, no, no.
[50:04.23]You can't.
[50:05.00]On go, you can't say no way.
[50:07.16]I know, but I was confident that I could grab you if you jumped, if we failed, and you didn't seem ready.
[50:12.58]True.
[50:14.80]It's fair.
[50:31.29]What the fuck?
[50:33.39]I thought that was good.
[50:34.19]I'm dragging your ass up the mountain.
[50:37.79]I don't even care.
[50:46.82]Oh, geez.
[50:48.20]Alright, one last real try and then we'll play the other one.
[50:58.72]Is this really going to be a three game night?
[51:00.40]I don't know.
[51:03.38]Are you down after this?
[51:03.98]I don't know.
[51:06.32]I'm just surprised that.
[51:07.27]I'm just surprised.
[51:15.85]Okay, I'm grabbing.
[51:16.65]Got it.
[51:21.88]Hey, just in case you didn't know, I'm grabbing.
[51:23.42]Okay.
[51:34.01]I have an itchy head.
[51:34.67]Don't wait.
[51:36.26]Don't wait.
[51:36.78]Okay.
[51:37.38]You're grabbing first, right?
[51:38.30]I'm grabbing.
[51:38.80]That's pressing shift.
[51:47.77]Sorry.
[51:54.89]Anytime I play a game like this, do you get like this too?
[51:57.55]Where, like I'm, I sit at this desk.
[52:00.82]I've probably sat here for hundreds and hundreds, if not maybe thousands of hours.
[52:04.64]I right now am so uncomfortable.
[52:06.90]It's just like, oh, everything's wrong.
[52:08.86]Like where I am seated, how high I am in the chair, where my fingers are.
[52:12.84]Everything just feels incorrect.
[52:13.70]I get that in other games.
[52:16.00]Alright.
[52:18.85]No.
[52:18.99]No.
[52:45.34]Okay, okay Oof, that one is actually really hard What a deluge What are you doing?
[53:08.01]You did the Mario thing where you jump after landing perfectly.
[53:11.57]Well, I pressed up to try and pull you up because that's what I thought it was before.
[53:25.40]Okay.
[53:27.94]Okay, we botched this twice in a row.
[53:30.10]What's the problem?
[53:30.68]You botched this because you're the one letting go.
[53:32.92]Yeah, but it's... I feel like this is very precise, very difficult.
[53:37.88]I think you really got to run and jumpy.
[53:40.48]I don't know.
[53:41.36]You just got to do it.
[53:42.48]You just got to be good.
[53:43.36]I'm going to go for it.
[53:46.25]I'm doing a perfect circle.
[53:49.31]That was... I mean, that was good.
[53:50.55]That was like... I don't know if I could do better than that.
[53:52.97]I don't know if I could have done better than that.
[53:56.03]That was like right there.
[53:57.59]What the hell?
[54:00.03]You've done better than that.
[54:01.69]No, I didn't.
[54:02.95]I...
[54:08.62]damn it what are we doing what am I doing wrong there are you jumping or are you not alright do you want do you want to move on to the cat horror game or what I will continue to play okay because you want to play let's get up there one more time and then do you want to try that
[54:37.20]You want to try that?
[54:46.96]This game is addicting, though.
[54:48.60]It's a really fun concept.
[54:51.33]I love the concept.
[54:53.17]Apparently, you can play it in single player and you get like a rock.
[54:57.09]That's weird.
[54:59.01]I'm not exactly sure how that works.
[55:04.79]Do you want to try these or do you want me to just keep going for it?
[55:07.98]Stay in your lane.
[55:08.98]Yeah, but me staying in my lane didn't work out the last time.
[55:13.94]I... You have more experience under your belt.
[55:20.41]That's true.
[55:21.51]I don't want to throw that experience away.
[55:23.05]This one?
[55:39.39]But also, you're really kind of trash.
[55:43.56]No, it's hard.
[55:44.84]You do it.
[55:45.52]You do it, and you'll see.
[55:47.28]It's hard.
[55:50.94]It's like the momentum.
[55:51.92]I'm doing it.
[55:52.39]I'm the anchor.
[55:53.75]Okay, ready?
[56:00.17]You're trash.
[56:01.67]You're trash.
[56:02.93]You are trash.
[56:04.07]You're trash can.
[56:05.78]Garbage can.
[56:14.11]No, get back.
[56:14.83]You get back in there and we're doing it.
[56:17.81]I closed it.
[56:19.03]You closed it?
[56:22.01]Okay, we can do it, right?
[56:29.79]It wouldn't be funny if you just weren't even close.
[56:33.95]That's funny.
[56:35.89]How are you doing?
[56:36.85]Are you good?
[56:37.51]You still here?
[56:38.35]No, sure.
[56:40.37]I'll invite you again.
[56:41.59]Cool.
[56:41.71]Alright, let's go.
[56:43.96]What do you like about these kinds of torture CBT games?
[56:49.30]Because it shows your character.
[56:52.12]It shows if you're really able to persevere through something very, very difficult.
[57:03.39]It takes a lot of patience, which I don't have any of, which is a great challenge for me because I have zero patience.
[57:14.31]What?
[57:15.53]I have zero patience, so it's a good challenge to sit down and be like, just do it.
[57:19.35]Okay.
[57:22.77]I want you to do these because you need to get some experience.
[57:28.60]I don't want to do it.
[57:29.32]Stay in our lane.
[57:30.30]Okay.
[57:30.54]We're going to stay in our lanes.
[57:32.08]Okay.
[57:36.04]Why did we just do that?
[57:36.90]We could have just jumped normally.
[57:38.67]Well, you were getting practice.
[57:40.99]Ah, I see.
[57:50.26]I do want you to be a little bit more confident in these though, but I don't need to do a full 360 for these tiny ones.
[58:07.03]You alright?
[58:09.15]No.
[58:24.63]fucking I don't have patience I do gardening and clay sculptures you have any plants no why not why do I need plants it's fun wrong way what happens if now's not a good time to test now's not a good time to test I don't think it is
[59:08.45]Remember this part?
[59:09.47]Well, that was weird.
[59:10.23]I held it.
[59:12.09]I'm dying.
[59:12.95]I'm actually going to die.
[59:14.23]Stop.
[59:14.53]You're freaking me out.
[59:22.70]That one's actually really, really hard.
[59:24.86]It is.
[59:25.06]Stop fucking around.
[59:40.94]Thanks.
[59:47.06]Alright, we're back.
[59:49.58]Not yet.
[59:50.02]We're not back yet.
[59:51.98]We're almost back.
[60:00.87]You fucker.
[60:02.21]You got in my head.
[60:02.85]You were like, you need to go faster with these ones.
[60:05.59]Not this one.
[60:06.35]This one's tough.
[60:10.31]It's fine.
[60:10.71]We're right here.
[60:29.09]You're doing those way too late.
[60:31.54]I know, but it's a little too... Just go.
[60:34.38]I'll get it again.
[60:34.80]I'll get it.
[60:45.88]It's hard.
[60:46.54]I promise it's tricky.
[60:50.99]Hey, you got the easy job.
[60:52.05]You just have to dangle.
[60:52.93]There you go.
[61:06.55]There's no encouragement.
[61:12.65]Do not encourage.
[61:13.81]Don't encourage me.
[61:26.45]Okay, which do you like more?
[61:28.13]The game or me suffering?
[61:38.55]I need a full revolution for these.
[61:39.61]That's a tough one.
[61:56.70]Oh!
[61:58.66]Wait, hold on.
[61:59.78]Sweaty.
[62:01.58]Okay.
[62:11.44]No!
[62:11.56]My game lagged.
[62:12.16]It actually did.
[62:12.66]I swear to God.
[62:13.48]People saw it.
[62:14.22]It was like a... It actually happened.
[62:18.16]I swear to God, it actually happened.
[62:19.76]It really happened.
[62:22.06]It's unfortunate.
[62:22.98]It really did.
[62:24.72]I wish I was making it up.
[62:25.58]I'm not...
[62:29.12]It's about those checkpoints.
[62:41.20]Stop and do it.
[62:43.13]Alright.
[62:43.75]You claim to want to try and then like you get us in it.
[62:45.93]We get out of a rhythm and then you like anchor yourself on the ground.
[62:49.13]I'm coping.
[62:52.23]Alright.
[62:52.69]This is the last one we're going to do.
[62:54.79]And then do you want to play the other game or are you taking off?
[63:01.13]I keep hearing this is the last one, but I feel like you really deeply want this.
[63:07.63]I don't think we're going to beat it.
[63:08.49]I just want to get up to 100.
[63:09.25]We're at like 75.
[63:09.65]Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[63:44.26]Ding, ding, ding.
[63:53.57]Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[63:55.45]Alright, don't do that.
[63:56.52]Ding, ding, ding.
[63:57.82]Actually stop doing that because you're like 30 milliseconds later.
[64:01.52]Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[64:05.34]I don't like that.
[64:06.98]Ding, ding, ding.

[65:03.56]Oh wow, we're back.
[65:05.27]We're really back.
[65:08.08]This is the wall right here.
[65:09.88]It's been the wall the whole time.
[65:11.54]Alright, let me get ready.
[65:12.79]So I'm doing it too late or too early?
[65:15.77]I don't know.
[65:16.39]I don't know what you're doing.
[65:17.83]This is to get us over.
[65:18.87]Okay.
[65:19.25]Alright.
[65:20.53]Alright.
[65:24.67]You're not going to make it.
[65:25.37]I'm doing it too late.
[65:26.26]Too late.
[65:26.74]Too late.
[65:26.92]You're not going to make it.
[65:28.22]Well, I can't.
[65:28.78]I'm not going to make it if you're going the wrong way.
[65:35.92]And there it is.
[65:36.66]And there.
[65:37.12]Oh.
[65:49.87]We're back.

[65:50.95]This is where we lost last time.
[65:52.27]This is the one right here.
[65:53.01]We're going to get up to 100.
[65:56.03]Stop looking around.
[65:56.65]I know you're messing around.
[65:57.75]This one's fucked up.
[65:59.45]It is.
[65:59.65]I need you on your A game.
[66:05.67]I have to do this one a little later.
[66:06.85]So we get some air because it's higher than us.
[66:10.07]Alright, here we go.
[66:11.63]I'm going for it.
[66:14.21]I need a full revolution.
[66:23.89]Bingo.
[66:25.29]Alright, 75.
[66:26.29]Let's go.
[66:26.63]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[66:32.25]This one might be hard because is it a jump from here?
[66:34.61]No, it's not.
[66:35.83]This is a game ender.
[66:38.29]This is, if we slide down, we got to climb all the way back up here again.
[66:41.04]Alright, we're not going to have this.
[66:42.62]That's not going to happen.
[66:43.16]That's the end.
[66:44.46]People are saying save it right now.
[66:48.16]What button is save?
[66:50.28]I got to go into like cheater mode because it's options.
[66:53.86]Options has, um.
[66:57.10]It's check, do checkpoint, checkpoint, checkpoint.
[66:59.17]We bought, we got a card, didn't we?
[67:02.11]So F is not, let me try it.
[67:04.79]What is it on mine?
[67:05.45]What's it on Fred?
[67:08.05]N. Okay, let's try it.
[67:09.59]Ready?
[67:11.27]Yeah.
[67:12.69]Uh, I don't think it doesn't do anything.
[67:14.15]Doesn't do anything for me either.
[67:14.91]Should we talk to the guy?
[67:16.69]Might as well talk.
[67:22.09]I don't know.
[67:24.75]Assist mode needs to be turned on.
[67:25.99]Yeah, assist mode checkpoints.
[67:30.39]And then there's pull rope, which was on by default.
[67:33.77]Infinite jumps.
[67:35.87]Who cares anymore?
[67:37.00]We don't need any of that.
[67:40.18]That's when I get to 100.
[67:40.68]Okay, so if we go...
[67:46.40]Oh, oh, look at that.
[67:49.88]OK, cool.
[67:51.38]So the plan is.
[67:53.74]We know the plan.
[67:56.72]I grab first, yes.
[68:10.95]OK, and then I'm going to let you go.
[68:13.67]You're going to grab that wall.
[68:15.59]You gotta let go!
[68:27.97]Ready?
[68:29.13]Yes!
[68:31.11]Yes!
[68:34.90]Alright, here we are.
[68:35.76]We didn't even need the checkpoint.
[68:36.64]Look at this.
[68:44.78]85.
[68:44.82]We're good.
[68:49.34]Uh... This might be a running jumper.
[68:51.09]Okay, I'll do running.
[68:58.69]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[69:00.27]What?
[69:04.32]Okay.
[69:04.82]Alright.
[69:05.10]Are you dumping your pants right now?
[69:06.94]Or are we playing?
[69:08.34]You know I wear gamer diapers.
[69:12.92]I'm just going for it.
[69:14.04]What a mistake.
[69:15.04]Just go to the checkpoint.
[69:16.60]What the fuck are you talking about?
[69:19.28]I'm just going to go for it.
[69:20.90]Bug chip.
[69:21.68]Bug chip.
[69:22.38]We got the clock.
[69:23.56]Let's go.
[69:30.67]Okay.
[69:32.93]Now, how do we get back to the checkpoint?
[69:34.05]I don't know.
[69:39.39]How do we get to the checkpoint?
[69:41.95]See?
[69:44.27]M?
[69:46.01]Ooh, I like this game now.
[69:49.39]Ready?
[69:49.71]Now!
[69:49.89]Let go!
[70:15.34]Thank you.
[70:19.94]We're fine.
[70:27.20]You look so defeated.
[70:29.56]Me?
[70:30.28]Your character.
[70:30.80]Oh.
[70:31.52]Alright, let's go.
[70:36.83]Same deal.
[70:37.37]This is a running jumper.
[70:42.51]Good idea.
[70:52.74]What are you doing?
[70:54.16]Don't you criticize me when you don't know how hard it is.
[70:57.02]You gave it one attempt and you were like... You're not even waiting for the full... You gave this one attempt and Alt F4'd the game.
[71:08.58]That's just fucking weird.
[71:09.96]You didn't even grab anything.
[71:15.19]You didn't either.
[71:15.81]True.
[71:32.76]It's the quiet moments in life.
[71:35.96]I agree.
[71:38.18]You really take in the snowflakes.
[71:42.35]The beautiful horizon, too.
[71:43.45]It's wonderful looking.
[71:48.19]Don't worry.
[71:48.65]I grabbed it.
[71:53.39]What's the plan here?
[71:58.10]Perfect timing.
[72:01.96]This is a jump.
[72:03.74]This is a jump.
[72:11.81]This is a jump.
[72:14.61]This is a jump.
[72:17.69]Waiting for the countdown.
[72:18.81]Haven't seen it.
[72:21.86]This is a jump.
[72:28.02]You grabbing?
[72:29.18]Run start.
[72:31.10]I'll grab.
[72:36.14]Good call.
[72:40.63]This is a jump.
[72:42.27]Yes, it is.
[72:44.87]Run start.
[72:46.65]No, that's going to fuck us up.
[72:48.87]It actually.
[72:51.35]This might be a swing.
[72:52.25]Throw checkpoint.
[72:54.88]It might be.
[72:55.44]Let's just cheat.
[72:55.92]Let's jump at it and try and grab it if you miss.
[72:58.30]Alright.
[72:59.58]You want to put his flag down?
[73:02.99]I mean, if we're going to cheat, might as well cheat.
[73:05.89]Somebody's cheating.
[73:08.27]Are you ready?
[73:12.43]I got you.
[73:12.81]I got you.
[73:14.52]I think this is a regular jump too.
[73:17.02]This is a jump.
[73:20.52]There we are.
[73:20.94]Look at that.
[73:25.48]Get it out of your system because it's about to get hard.
[73:33.98]We made it.
[73:35.72]We made it past the first area.
[73:36.91]We did it.
[73:37.81]We're not at 100 yet.
[73:39.51]No, we're not.
[73:44.77]I mean, that's a good call, I guess.
[73:47.39]Now what?
[73:50.48]I don't know.
[73:52.62]Oh, we got a swing there.
[73:53.86]Alright.
[74:00.06]I was about to do it, too.
[74:01.75]No, you weren't.
[74:05.83]cat horror game now no I'm going for it I'm going for it right no I can't start the swinging down here it kills the momentum and if you drop I can see there's like down there we don't gotta do
[74:32.68]Okay.
[74:34.46]Ooh.
[74:35.00]Alright.
[74:35.80]That's bad.
[74:37.18]No, they come back.
[74:37.78]Okay, let's walk over.
[74:40.93]I guess it's been... Do I just drop you down there?
[74:46.49]Oh, wait, wait.
[74:47.13]Angle you down?
[74:47.71]Wait, wait, wait.
[74:49.73]Oh, that's a jump up here.
[74:51.05]Jump up to the wall.
[74:53.57]This might need a running start.
[74:54.97]Here, let's go to the other side.
[74:56.29]We're going to run across and do a jump up.
[74:58.85]I feel you.
[74:59.71]Just in case.
[75:00.33]We're going to be careful.
[75:01.48]I feel you.
[75:09.72]Oh, this is going to be hard.
[75:10.80]You want me to grab?
[75:12.52]Yeah, I want you to fucking grab it.
[75:15.06]Have you played this before?
[75:18.26]Even if I was going to grab, you didn't give me enough time to swing over and grab.
[75:21.59]You didn't even give me enough time.
[75:23.55]You just let go.
[75:25.33]I love how you flipped it on me.
[75:27.35]You flipped it on me, but you just went for it.
[75:29.29]You flipped it on me, too.
[75:30.27]That was uncalled for.
[75:30.85]But you touched the wall.
[75:31.69]You could have grabbed.
[75:32.57]Okay, everything's fine.
[75:36.26]Just relax.
[75:55.51]You gotta go.
[75:58.03]Yep.
[75:58.37]Pull me up.
[76:01.59]Or do you... You gonna pull me up or are we... What's happening here?
[76:07.97]I'm enjoying this.
[76:10.07]I really need like rest.
[76:11.57]You know?
[76:11.87]I did it myself.
[76:15.42]Don't worry.
[76:21.54]Three, one, two, three, go.
[76:24.11]Don't do that.
[76:25.69]I had to.
[76:27.15]Don't do that.
[76:28.29]Why are you doing that?
[76:31.21]We have to.
[76:32.03]It's where you have to.
[76:32.87]It's built in timing.
[76:34.61]Alright.
[76:35.27]Alright.
[76:35.49]Alright.
[76:35.73]Alright.
[76:35.97]We're good.
[76:40.32]You just got to go for it.
[76:48.97]Alright, built-in timing.
[76:51.55]We're just doing the built-in timing.
[76:52.69]It's built-in.
[76:55.01]It's a normal platformer right now.
[76:57.13]Oh yeah.
[77:00.37]Okay, now wait.
[77:01.31]Patience.
[77:02.15]Figure out where we're going.
[77:03.75]This is tricky because we have to jump together to that top left.
[77:07.47]You'll grab it and then we'll swing.
[77:08.66]No, no, no, no.
[77:09.28]Wait, wait.
[77:10.64]You don't think so?
[77:11.84]Yes, you're right.
[77:13.16]I'm going to jump and I'm going to grab it.
[77:16.04]Built-in timing.
[77:19.59]Good.
[77:20.17]OK, that's going to fall.
[77:27.68]So built in timing.
[77:29.50]OK.
[77:31.38]OK, good.
[77:36.97]Oh, wait, hold on.
[77:38.01]We don't have to, there's no built-in timing right now.
[77:39.99]There is, it's a platform.
[77:41.15]Yeah, but we need to see what's going on here.
[77:42.65]We can just go.
[77:43.41]Just jump up to it.
[77:44.39]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[77:45.23]Alright, you ready?
[77:45.93]You fucking coward.
[77:47.11]Built-in timing.
[77:49.07]And you didn't even do it right, sir.
[77:50.76]There's two of us.
[77:53.22]I'm going to enjoy this.
[77:55.30]Thank you.
[77:55.82]Thank you for taking a second here, because I can fucking use it.
[78:00.12]Built-in timing, top left.
[78:01.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[78:02.68]What?
[78:04.67]Okay.
[78:04.81]You can't just do that.
[78:06.23]What are you talking about?
[78:07.46]Hold on.
[78:11.44]We got to stop for a second.
[78:13.08]Okay.
[78:13.20]We're jumping to the left.
[78:14.48]We got to swing.
[78:15.88]And then we need to run.
[78:17.50]Yes.
[78:17.76]Built-in timing after you land.
[78:19.00]Good.
[78:30.89]Good idea.
[78:34.88]This might be built-in timing, built-in timing.
[78:36.74]I'm not sure.
[78:37.70]Go!
[78:39.98]Get up here, get up here, get up here, get up here.
[78:41.46]We have to duck.
[78:42.40]No, I don't know what to do.
[78:43.94]Grab.
[78:44.08]I have to grab.
[78:45.06]Built-in timing, built-in timing this way.
[78:46.52]Alright, we're fine.
[78:47.52]Okay.
[78:57.35]Alright, you grab.
[78:58.45]You always grab first.
[79:04.20]It didn't grab because I was on the ground.
[79:06.44]I expected it to grab.
[79:12.52]What kind of fucked up Mario game have you been playing with the built-in timing is that early?
[79:16.80]Where are we going?
[79:21.67]We need to wait for this, I think.
[79:22.87]Uh-oh.
[79:25.01]I think I know what to do.
[79:28.51]Oh my god.
[79:30.80]Okay, I don't know.
[79:31.38]I don't get it.
[79:32.56]We need to look at it for a second.
[79:33.52]I'm kind of wondering if you can grab the side of the... What about just jumping left, left?
[79:41.97]Can I duck?
[79:47.95]Built it!
[79:49.43]Okay, we got to like either swing to that platform, I think.
[79:52.13]I think we go left.
[79:52.81]I'm in the middle here.
[79:54.22]Built in timing.
[79:58.74]Wait, what?
[79:59.58]What have you done?
[80:00.88]No!
[80:02.12]No!
[80:02.70]I thought we built in timing.
[80:04.11]I thought we built in... It's alright.
[80:05.47]Built into what?
[80:06.81]You said, I think we need left.
[80:08.65]I didn't know what left you meant.
[80:10.07]It's alright.
[80:10.55]Lakitu just picked us up.
[80:11.99]We're fine.
[80:18.52]Okay, so we're going to drop and then go left.
[80:20.12]Drop, left.
[80:21.02]Built in timing.
[80:23.92]Pull me up.
[80:26.72]You grab, then we'll swing.
[80:30.81]That was fucked up and you know it.
[80:32.77]That was weird on you.
[80:33.67]You did great.
[80:36.23]What are you doing?
[80:37.77]What's happening to you?
[80:38.63]What's happening to you?
[80:41.19]You didn't anchor when I... Why did you not anchor?
[80:43.76]This is so... Stop the timing.
[80:51.98]How come you jumped weird?
[80:54.12]You're weird.
[80:55.38]Go down.
[80:55.68]Stop the timing.
[80:58.99]No!
[80:59.29]It's alright.
[81:00.19]For some stupid reason, I thought this was going to drop too.
[81:01.91]We're fine.
[81:11.17]See, you need to anchor.
[81:12.15]Who?
[81:13.49]How are we doing this?
[81:16.92]I don't know.
[81:17.58]Can we just talk about it?
[81:18.72]Can we just talk through this?
[81:19.74]Let's talk.
[81:20.44]This doesn't make any sense.
[81:24.92]I think we can make the jump from here to there if we do it.
[81:30.82]And then we built in timing to the top right.
[81:34.32]Okay.
[81:35.42]Maybe.
[81:41.34]Yep.
[81:41.68]Okay, we're good.
[81:44.03]Now stop and let's look at this one too.
[81:45.71]We're going to have to... As the thing's coming down, we're going to need to... Built in timing, built in timing, built in timing.
[81:52.29]Hold on.
[81:55.81]That's fucked up, isn't it?
[81:58.53]Okay.
[81:59.21]Okay.
[81:59.53]Next one.
[82:00.11]We're doing next one.
[82:01.01]As soon as we see the next one coming down, we're going to jump across.
[82:03.83]Alright.
[82:04.07]But what, how far down is it back midway?
[82:08.79]What do you want to go midway?
[82:09.82]Do you want to wait till it's kind of at the bottom or what are you thinking?
[82:13.36]I think we have to wait till it's past the bottom because otherwise we'll hit our heads.
[82:18.20]I'm going to count it down.
[82:22.68]Alright.
[82:30.17]Almost.
[82:36.01]Do you get infinite checkpoints?
[82:38.01]Ster wanted to cheat and I was against it.
[82:39.99]Okay.
[82:41.32]I kept saying, man, we should really try to do it like on our own and try to really get the achievement of doing it.
[82:45.12]But he was like, he DM'd me a few times over here.
[82:47.04]Just like, dude, I'm fucking leaving if you don't let me do this.
[82:52.10]He's like, I'm going to make up a story how I have to go.
[82:54.20]Then I'm just like, dude, what the fuck?
[82:56.38]Right?
[82:56.64]It's annoying.
[83:01.99]Good job.
[83:02.79]To the right, I think.
[83:07.17]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[83:10.35]Man, we're on our toes.
[83:12.56]Okay.
[83:13.00]This is a double?
[83:13.50]Is this coming by?
[83:14.14]Super Mario!
[83:18.08]Super Mario!
[83:18.48]Just stay on it.
[83:20.24]Pull me up.
[83:23.68]To the right.
[83:25.98]Pull me up!
[83:26.64]Pull me up!
[83:27.28]Pull me up!
[83:30.67]These are not good timings.
[83:31.85]These are not good automatic timings.
[83:34.57]Your timing on where you would do that jump is different than mine.
[83:37.58]Yeah, Commander, give me the... I don't even know what button that is on mine.
[83:42.52]I have a different control screen.
[83:43.30]No, no, you don't need to do that just like vocally.
[83:45.66]Okay, I'm going to go... Alright, ready?
[83:48.08]Three, two, one, go.
[83:51.36]There we are.
[83:51.94]Again, again, again.
[83:53.74]We have to go... You stopped.
[83:55.36]I know, but I was distracted.
[83:58.44]Can you get on that?
[84:01.95]Let go.
[84:03.19]Nice job.
[84:04.01]Alright, follow me up.
[84:07.90]Three, two, one.
[84:11.14]Alright, we gotta go boom, boom.
[84:14.68]You ready?
[84:15.42]One, two, three, go.
[84:17.66]Go.
[84:18.87]There we are.
[84:19.33]Boom, boom.
[84:20.37]Then this is another game.
[84:21.23]Ready?
[84:21.67]One, two, go.
[84:25.94]I wasn't ready.
[84:27.26]But I wasn't ready.
[84:28.46]It's alright.
[84:29.72]But I wasn't ready.
[84:30.54]You gotta take quarterback then.
[84:32.70]You gotta be quarterback.
[84:43.70]Look at these fucking timings.
[84:46.73]Very good.
[84:50.69]That's not correct.
[84:52.13]That's not correct.
[84:57.78]OK.
[84:59.88]321 go.
[85:00.62]OK, OK, I understand.
[85:04.63]I did not understand what you're talking about.
[85:06.21]I'm ready to go.
[85:07.87]That just just jump off off here.
[85:09.61]OK, we're gonna.
[85:10.57]OK, OK.
[85:17.31]Very good, very good.
[85:18.55]I think I'm lost.
[85:26.31]There look at that.
[85:30.81]all my fingers are cramping up okay here's what's gonna happen three two one go we jump on those okay and they're gonna fall and then you're gonna grab nice
[85:55.44]This one looks like it's a jump grab, and then I grab wall, and then I... Okay, hold on.
[86:00.18]We gotta get this planned out.
[86:02.08]This is a... We jump, you grab the left side of wall.
[86:05.46]I swing around, I grab right side of wall.
[86:08.56]You go, I let go, we land on built-in timing.
[86:12.89]We have to built-in timing jump to that right wall, and I don't know what the hell's over there.
[86:17.03]Yep.
[86:17.35]So you are gonna grab that rightmost wall.
[86:20.25]Yep.
[86:20.75]Okay, ready?
[86:22.13]Let's... All the way to the left, running start.
[86:23.97]Yep.
[86:24.25]For this one.
[86:34.70]OK, here we go.
[86:35.08]OK, good.
[86:39.11]I'm going to grab the other side of the wall.
[86:41.13]OK, here we go.
[86:48.31]Beautiful.
[86:48.63]Alright, this is where it gets kind of weird.
[86:54.16]Are we checkpoint Andes?
[86:55.50]Yeah, look, we've already done six of them so far.
[87:03.51]all of the tension is gone hey we're having fun though I think we just jump when it's hitting the bottom or no when it's hitting the top maybe yeah okay ready I'm gonna count three tops and then we're gonna jump okay we're jumping on the fourth top so like one two jump on the third one or jump on the like technically the fourth one
[87:32.52]Like top, top, top, jump.
[87:36.10]Okay.
[87:36.42]Got it.
[87:36.86]Okay.
[87:38.78]One, two, three.
[87:44.29]We're okay.
[87:45.41]We're alright.
[87:47.55]We're good.
[87:49.47]I got scared.
[87:51.31]It wasn't going to work.
[87:52.85]It's scary.
[87:53.65]No, it wasn't.
[87:53.93]I don't think it was going to work.
[87:54.97]I think it's going to work.
[87:55.87]I think it's going to work.
[87:57.29]Okay.
[87:58.53]Top, top, top, bottom.
[88:02.46]yeah see this is a built-in timing this is we jump right when we hit the top and then built-in timing to the right okay alright same deal we're gonna do top top go no keep it the same top top top go there's no need for three top tops yes there is you told me to stay consistent with our roles consistency there's an update there's a patch
[88:27.07]top top go top top go okay you do the count top top go go I went look at us we don't even gotta fucking talk about it people that people that come to the stream are don't tell them we're using checkpoints until they have to find out because they'll think we're good at the end
[88:53.78]So I gotta like... I gotta like... Hold on.
[88:56.28]Yeah, what's the deal here?
[88:57.84]We gotta hide it.
[89:00.42]Oh, hide it.
[89:01.02]I see what you mean.
[89:01.88]What is that?
[89:02.24]Is it part of the environment?
[89:03.42]It's a piece of wood.
[89:03.98]Okay.
[89:05.97]Okay, so I'm gonna jump and grab and then... I don't know.
[89:12.07]You jump and grab and then you have to let go when I get up to the point where I can touch the wood.
[89:21.11]Oh, it doesn't break.
[89:22.07]Oh, okay.
[89:22.66]Well, that's...
[89:25.84]Alright.
[89:28.30]You jump and grab.
[89:29.16]Okay.
[89:32.16]Wait, this doesn't make sense.
[89:39.11]Yeah, you need to land.
[89:42.35]Let's grab the... I think we can do grab the other side.
[89:45.81]One of us can get up and land on top.
[89:50.68]No.
[89:51.06]I don't think that's the strat.
[89:52.68]You just have to swing around and land on top of this.
[89:56.85]Just land on it.
[89:57.31]And then it's going to break and then you're going to be dangling below me.
[90:03.39]Alright, what do you want to do?
[90:08.82]There's a whole area to the right is extra.
[90:14.36]I think that's actually what we have to do.
[90:20.49]Or maybe go from the top.
[90:22.33]Can we like throw ourselves up?
[90:23.79]Alright, just give me some
[90:36.36]I don't know how the grab is allowed to work here.
[90:38.15]Hold on.
[90:45.47]You're grabbing it.
[90:46.15]Oh, I thought you want to try something.
[90:53.15]So what's your plan?
[90:54.99]I want to try and not fall on it, but.
[90:58.16]Oh, try to grab the other side.
[91:01.24]That's what I'm saying, but it doesn't let me like swing inward.
[91:04.14]Hmm.
[91:08.24]I have an idea.
[91:10.40]Let me throw you.
[91:15.04]That's not going to work.
[91:15.92]It might.
[91:16.20]Alright.
[91:27.45]Everybody, we're going to do our 20 minute.
[91:30.17]Everybody closes their eyes and relaxes.
[91:31.97]Okay.
[91:32.53]Close your eyes.
[91:33.07]Three, two, one.
[91:34.33]We didn't do checkpoint or whatever.
[91:35.59]Well, we got it.
[91:38.12]Okay.
[91:45.14]I tried to grab it.
[91:45.76]I don't know what the fuck we're doing.
[91:50.96]It has to be you grab the other side.
[91:52.22]Are you ready?
[91:58.80]No, no.
[92:00.91]Pull me up.
[92:02.91]You swing.
[92:03.63]You do the swing.
[92:06.31]So I'm going to grab it.
[92:07.63]Okay.
[92:10.74]You do a full rotation.
[92:19.82]This is why we stick to our roles, huh?
[92:22.42]Oh, it's not as easy as it looks.
[92:24.84]Oh, you tried it one time.
[92:27.50]I didn't.
[92:27.92]I don't.
[92:29.00]Shut up and get off here.
[92:37.73]Do you hold left?
[92:39.39]Or do you have to go, like, one, two... I got it.
[92:42.53]Then you hold the... Then once you've spun around, you hold the direction.
[92:49.83]Okay, I thought I still had to change momentum from different sides.
[92:52.82]I didn't know you could hold it.
[92:55.04]Thanks for telling me the controls, by the way.
[92:57.48]Oh, wow.
[92:57.80]When you're only going one direction, you only hold one direction.
[93:00.30]Can we open our eyes?
[93:01.90]Not yet!
[93:02.62]It's still relaxing time.
[93:04.04]Okay, you ready?
[93:19.97]Oh my god, go!
[93:23.57]I was thinking... Okay, okay.
[93:25.53]We've just been learning.
[93:26.47]We've been learning the rules of the world.
[93:28.06]Yes, we have.
[93:28.52]Okay, you can open your eyes now.
[93:33.80]You can chill.
[93:38.38]I don't know what we're doing.
[93:40.04]I think we just have to just whip our... Just throw ourselves to the left.
[93:43.53]It's kind of... Here, you hold.
[93:46.07]We assume our roles.
[93:47.21]That's what we're going for.
[93:49.39]You got it.
[93:52.32]That was weird.
[93:53.72]It was weird.
[94:04.86]I think you have.
[94:05.94]Yeah, it doesn't really give any momentum.
[94:09.64]I think you have to grab the other side.
[94:14.38]After you get thrown over there, it's going to be.
[94:16.26]It actually might not be that hard if you if we do it like I throw you kind of in the air like this.
[94:23.77]I think here's what I think here's what I think here's what I think here's what I think here's what I think here's what I think here's what I think what I'm swinging around yeah and I'm slightly above it you need to let go so you're dropping pulls me down and then I grab the other side
[94:45.03]So I'm like here.
[94:47.61]Kind of.
[94:48.67]Kind of.
[94:49.03]Kind of.
[94:49.45]Kind of.
[94:49.83]Kind of.
[94:50.53]I don't.
[94:50.89]I feel like this isn't the way to do it.
[94:52.31]And we're going to get like the advanced version of this.
[94:54.17]And we're not going to be.
[94:55.05]We're just going to be.
[95:00.54]I don't know what we're going to be.
[95:01.40]I don't know.
[95:03.38]Hey, I'm going to do it like here.
[95:07.94]Shit.
[95:09.52]There's no way that.
[95:10.72]Both grab.
[95:11.66]Both climb and run.
[95:12.66]Come here.
[95:15.75]There's climbing?
[95:16.63]What do you mean climbing?
[95:17.87]I don't think you can climb.
[95:25.51]Can you replace Ster with penis music?
[95:34.68]You mean drown out Ster with penis music?
[95:36.38]I wouldn't be able to hear his callouts.
[95:39.90]Just climb.
[95:42.14]Just climb.
[95:42.58]Okay, you hold on.
[95:44.90]You hold it.
[95:49.63]Whoa, hold on a minute.
[95:50.55]Do it again.
[95:51.13]Okay, hold on.
[95:58.43]Stay there.
[95:58.75]Okay, let go.
[96:04.64]I almost had it.
[96:07.00]That was close.
[96:10.14]That was very close.
[96:16.52]So what?
[96:17.00]Ready?
[96:18.71]Let go now.
[96:20.99]Oh my god!
[96:21.79]I had it.
[96:22.07]I just should have jumped the other way.
[96:30.77]What?
[96:31.07]They're eating her.
[96:31.62]Then they're going to eat me.
[96:35.12]Here we go.
[96:37.90]Ready?
[96:42.08]Shit.
[96:42.92]That's it.
[96:43.28]On the third swing.
[96:44.04]Do you want to do it or do you want me to do it?
[96:48.38]You do it.
[96:50.16]I'm the grabber that's one two two the third one you're in the perfect spot kind of hard but then I don't get I don't get it I don't get when you're on there it's just gonna break and I'm dangling unless you like perfectly grab the left side without ever standing on it swing again I'm here
[97:22.97]Everybody close your eyes.
[97:23.71]Everybody close your eyes.
[97:28.41]Yeah, the left wall has to get grabbed.
[97:37.26]You grab it.
[97:40.22]Okay.
[97:40.36]One.
[97:41.62]Two.
[97:43.68]Three.
[97:44.54]Hell yeah.
[97:45.02]Alright, hold on.
[97:47.12]Whoa, that was weird.
[97:47.76]It bumped me.
[97:49.09]Yeah.
[97:51.51]We got it.
[97:52.83]Nice.
[97:53.05]Alright, you can open your eyes.
[97:54.63]Okay, there's a wooden horizontal over there.
[98:06.80]Yeah, I think I just get to that and built in timing.
[98:18.62]The jump was weird.
[98:23.19]oh man we should have put a no we don't need it I hear you that's weird one two three it's easy honestly whoa honestly I don't know why people would have trouble with that like I don't know why anyone would get here and like not be able to do that first try
[98:57.62]One.
[98:59.10]Two.
[99:00.78]A three.
[99:02.14]A three.
[99:06.94]Okay.
[99:12.11]Keep going.
[99:16.89]Wow!
[99:18.41]Wow, all you had to do was let go.
[99:20.71]I was freaking out.
[99:22.89]Can you put down a everybody close their eyes flag?
[99:26.56]I don't see anything.
[99:29.53]Alright, now what?
[99:32.99]Um... How high can we jump?
[99:36.09]We gotta jump up to the right one, then to the left one.
[99:38.79]Can we make that?
[99:41.03]Yeah.
[99:41.19]From here?
[99:41.59]Okay.
[99:50.20]I don't know about that one.
[99:51.40]Neither do I. What's over here?
[99:53.84]Nothing?
[99:54.14]Oh.
[99:54.20]Where does that go?
[99:56.26]I don't know.
[99:57.82]Let's jump on it.
[100:04.50]Jesus jeepers how in tarnation did you get up here it must have been a tough journey am I right kids the seal by golly it ain't mine but we are closer than two catfish in a skillet now her name is gertrude how would I know this guy's a nobody that timing's not right
[100:35.56]Can you pull me up?
[100:40.88]Can you pull me up?
[100:56.68]I mean, let's just try it.
[100:58.14]Yeah.
[100:59.00]Okay, worst that happens is we fall and we built in timing just back up here to the right.
[101:07.47]good falling down on that one good like a pro oh god okay as soon as it clicks into the top we're gonna jump yeah and I'm grabbing the right side
[101:51.81]What the fuck?
[101:53.11]What?
[102:03.67]There are no stakes anymore.
[102:05.09]It doesn't even matter.
[102:07.26]Oh, God.
[102:08.64]Don't drop us.
[102:11.48]Okay.
[102:11.74]I'm going to count it down.
[102:18.21]One, two, three.
[102:26.88]No!
[102:30.00]No!
[102:30.44]No!
[102:31.67]What?
[102:32.35]Close your eyes.
[102:48.29]Nice.
[102:50.41]Oh, my accolades.
[102:51.65]My accolades.
[102:54.35]We were a little too underneath.
[102:58.36]No!
[102:59.76]No!
[103:00.72]Actually, no.
[103:01.64]Grab!
[103:03.60]No!
[103:04.26]Just call Lakitu and get us the fuck back up there, please.
[103:25.17]Okay, we stand on the right side of this thing.
[103:28.64]We keep bumping our heads.
[103:34.60]Two, three.
[103:43.06]You gotta let me go.
[103:44.92]No, I don't.
[103:45.66]Yeah, you do.
[103:46.34]That's all you.
[103:46.89]You gotta let me go.
[103:47.87]Alright, this is built-in timing, but we have to be careful.
[103:52.25]Okay.
[103:52.79]This is a jump.
[103:53.77]Yes.
[103:59.31]I get it now!
[104:01.06]What?
[104:02.18]Oh my god!
[104:03.10]If I put my brain on like a 50 millisecond delay, we are perfectly in sync.
[104:08.02]Those jumps were like, jump, wait, jump, wait, jump.
[104:13.44]And it was perfect.
[104:15.04]Yeah, that's how you make sure that you can be together when you jump.
[104:18.88]No, the built-in timing is when you land, you just jump to the next one because you've already landed.
[104:23.60]Yes.
[104:25.76]That's not what that was.
[104:29.09]I know, but you're... We're 0.5... We're 50 milliseconds behind each other anyways.
[104:34.18]Okay, no, it's more like...
[104:37.40]It's more than 50.
[104:38.20]You do understand that even you talking through Discord is coming through at like... It's more than 50.
[104:43.74]It's like a half a second.
[104:45.98]It's like jump.
[104:46.92]Okay, confirm we've both landed.
[104:48.80]Have a cognitive... Okay, now jump.
[104:52.02]It's not like jump land, jump land, jump land.
[104:54.56]It's not that.
[104:55.38]It is not this.
[104:56.56]It is jump.
[104:57.52]Boom.
[104:58.74]I didn't know that you were doing that this whole time.
[105:03.74]When you say, like, built-in timing, these things fall, it's like, okay, jump, jump.
[105:07.31]Yeah, but you have to get, like, the jump has to land.
[105:09.29]We have to make sure we land the jump first.
[105:12.90]It only takes that long to know.
[105:14.80]Yeah, but here's the thing.
[105:15.56]But you don't know because that's why you got to like see it and be like, yes, okay, we've landed.
[105:19.72]Yeah, but you understand that we're doing this together.
[105:21.68]So we both need to land, boom, land, boom.
[105:24.29]Like you have to, built-in timing, built-in timing.
[105:26.99]The built-in timing is we are both landing at the same time already.
[105:31.59]That's why we don't need to wait for the other person to land because the jump was the built-in timing.
[105:35.53]But it's not that.
[105:36.41]The built-in timing is when you land.
[105:38.53]We've done it fine the whole time.
[105:40.35]We've done it fine the whole time.
[105:41.41]Land, pause.
[105:44.17]Okay, you're making it sound like it's like land, pause, land.
[105:47.37]No, no, it's not.
[105:49.49]Let's do it again.
[105:50.34]Let's go back.
[105:51.02]Go back to the checkpoint.
[105:56.68]Okay, now let's do it my way.
[105:58.28]What do you mean your way?
[105:59.87]The moment you land, we're just immediately going.
[106:02.61]Okay.
[106:02.89]Okay.
[106:07.03]See, you can't do it.
[106:08.55]No, but it's fucked up.
[106:09.65]It's fucked up because... It's not fucked up.
[106:10.91]Yes, it is.
[106:11.66]Yes, it is.
[106:12.76]I am doing... Go back and do it again.
[106:14.44]Ready?
[106:19.68]Why were you slow that time?
[106:21.14]Because I thought we were doing Jerma timing.
[106:22.55]No, no, no.
[106:22.99]That's not what I said.
[106:23.55]Do your time.
[106:24.13]Your time.
[106:24.97]Okay, my time.
[106:30.04]That's not enough time.
[106:30.94]That's not enough time.
[106:32.02]Once we synchronize with the 3, 2, 1, go, and then after that, it's automatic timing.
[106:38.31]Automatic timing, not pause reps.
[106:41.77]It's not a pause rep.
[106:42.77]It's a confirmation 50 milliseconds to make sure we've actually landed.
[106:47.37]It's a confirmation.
[106:50.20]If you jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, what if you miss?
[106:52.10]What if you don't?
[106:52.54]You're going to make sure you're in a nice spot.
[106:53.78]We could...
[106:55.40]if you miss you already missed there's no need to to stand still and confirm you've missed it's no it's a confirmation okay so in the future are we doing pause reps or are we doing like gamer reps gamer reps to me is a mistake in a game like look in any other scenario I would agree with you in a game like this you have to confirm you put something in my eye what did you do to my eye alright you ready got him got him hey hey what the dude what are you doing alright you ready
[107:25.78]We're going... Jermapace.
[107:28.86]But we did not even confirm that that was our different... Your timing of, like, go, go, go, go... I'm on beats.
[107:40.72]Right?
[107:41.12]Like... I'm on when you actually land is when the next jump needs to occur.
[107:46.74]You're like... No, you gotta be on a tempo.
[107:49.98]It's gotta be like... You're not doing a tempo!
[107:54.00]saying there are it's not a sound thing it's a visual I have jumped I have like it's as soon as you can jump you jump alright but here's the jump alright before you make everybody leave the stream with your with your incessant anger towards me and you're bickering have we had a problem this whole time
[108:12.71]Yes.
[108:13.71]Since when?
[108:14.49]I think that problem has come up several times.
[108:16.41]We've never fallen.
[108:17.15]Our jumps have desynced a little bit.
[108:18.89]You're like, oh, that jump was a little bit messed up.
[108:20.68]Like here is the first time I noticed it because it's very clearly these things will fall and you need to go across them as quickly as possible.
[108:26.40]Jermamites, who's with me?
[108:29.92]Sturmata, get in the battlements.
[108:33.76]Shoot the cannons at the Sturmata.
[108:36.35]Alright, you ready?
[108:37.29]Can we do this?
[108:39.68]And, ah, what happened there, Mr. Super Timing, Mr. Perfect Timing?
[108:43.29]What do you mean, what happened there?
[108:44.55]What happened there, Mr. Timing?
[108:45.63]You didn't wait for the three, two, one.
[108:47.19]He's got all these timings.
[108:48.01]You were early.
[108:49.45]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[108:50.96]Oh, we fell.
[108:53.40]Oh.
[108:53.92]No.
[108:55.22]Oh.
[108:55.58]Everyone close your eyes.
[109:06.34]You're just fucking with me now.
[109:07.68]He's fucking with me.
[109:09.22]I was going when we were... Pull me up.
[109:13.27]It's slippery.
[109:21.23]Okay.
[109:22.39]You automatically did a Jermapause rep on that one.
[109:24.78]But we didn't have a plan.
[109:26.10]We didn't have a plan.
[109:27.30]What do you mean?
[109:28.28]We've done this jump 60 times so far.
[109:30.74]We didn't have a plan.
[109:34.80]And why did you just jump right there, sir?
[109:36.71]Because I'm having an aneurysm.
[109:39.15]Oh, we're falling.
[109:40.59]Oh, fuck.
[109:49.94]That was weird.
[109:50.44]That was not us.
[109:53.20]It was you.
[109:54.46]No, that was like our toes got stuck.
[109:57.94]It's because it's slippery.
[110:00.64]no that's not what it was that was like our toes got stuck on the edge and we didn't jump forward pause I I haven't even been doing that you're just making it seem like I don't know what I'm doing and that's not exactly anything that happened I think it was very clearly demonstrated exactly what you were doing I think everyone is seen we took a poll uh the Jerma might uh warship has I got a 95 they were on my side I did a poll
[110:32.29]Speaking of 95% critic reviews.
[110:35.41]Yeah.
[110:37.05]How about that Diablo 4 Season 1?
[110:38.47]How are you feeling?
[110:39.73]You don't... Let's not... This is bad.
[110:41.55]You don't want us to talk about this.
[110:42.51]We'll be on this for like four hours.
[110:46.45]The second we get on D4, it's like it's over.
[110:48.03]Alright.
[111:02.63]I was reading my chat.
[111:05.92]Just get Lakitu to bring us back over there, please.
[111:08.62]I can't when I'm dangling.
[111:20.65]But we need to come up with a plan.
[111:23.27]We gotta jump here.
[111:24.13]It's a jump, jump, jump.
[111:25.75]It's weird.
[111:25.99]Jump over them.
[111:26.47]Oh, that's gonna... Okay.
[111:34.94]You gotta land on the platform, pal.
[111:38.24]I... I honestly... Buster!
[111:40.48]Buster!
[111:40.76]Hold on a second.
[111:41.75]Before you... Before everybody starts screaming about my accolades.
[111:44.63]You are the host.
[111:46.93]You are the host.
[111:49.11]You are the host, pal.
[111:50.53]What do you mean, pal?
[111:53.21]Now, you listen here, Buster.
[111:57.76]okay can we just like act like this is a single player game and just jump over like the slow moving thing we can jump on it you know how to jump on this yes where do we go from there you gotta wait till it gets to the top and jump right oh now you listen here buster
[112:30.14]I was ahead of you.
[112:34.64]Yeah, where does your loyalty stand?
[112:36.06]It's important.
[112:39.00]Are we going?
[112:43.26]You listen here, Buster.
[112:44.00]What was that about?
[112:45.02]Got it.
[112:46.66]Oh, I see.
[112:47.02]You got to get to the top of the mountain.
[112:49.61]I see what you're doing.
[112:51.17]We need to establish contact with these other villages.
[113:05.88]That's not going to be right.
[113:07.64]That was totally it.
[113:08.98]It was not.
[113:09.30]You just hit your head on the side.
[113:11.20]You didn't jump.
[113:12.25]No, run it back.
[113:12.97]I got my head stuck on the rope.
[113:14.69]No, run it back.
[113:15.45]I don't think we can even make this jump.
[113:16.69]Run it back.
[113:29.01]Dude, we gotta get a look at it first.
[113:34.07]It's built-in timing.
[113:35.85]It's Jermapause rep built-in timing.
[113:38.53]When we lock in left, we go onto the Metroid block.
[113:48.94]I feel like I've been doing it like that the whole time.
[113:53.78]Built-in timing.
[113:54.92]What are you talking about?
[114:00.97]Windy winds.
[114:04.39]Slippery.
[114:05.29]Very slippery.
[114:05.93]Slippery.
[114:06.73]Slippery.
[114:09.15]Just keep going.
[114:09.92]Okay.
[114:11.86]You see how there's like wind up there?
[114:20.80]Mm-hmm.
[114:23.96]Worried about that.
[114:26.46]Oh, you should be.
[114:28.00]Okay, it does like pull us.
[114:31.42]We have to use the wind.
[114:32.42]What is this?
[114:33.70]Oh God.
[114:35.10]Once it, once it kicks in.
[114:36.02]Nice.
[114:39.78]Nice job.
[114:43.10]Loser, loser, loser.
[114:44.44]What's in here?
[114:46.04]Secret.
[114:49.89]Any secrets in here?
[114:51.33]Doesn't look like it.
[114:55.03]Oh, we can put on different costumes.
[114:56.49]How did you do that?
[114:58.93]Oh, we can change our BDSM rope.
[115:08.84]oh pog you got this okay just wait wait wait wait once it ends we go
[115:32.23]Once the next, just, just anchor.
[115:34.67]And then once the, once the next one ends, um, um, hold on.
[115:38.07]I, I have, I've been, my hands been like this on the arrow keys the whole time on my right hand.
[115:43.76]Okay.
[115:56.85]Next.
[116:02.64]Also, we didn't really talk about that either.
[116:05.04]Okay, anchor.
[116:06.22]We didn't talk about that either.
[116:08.12]I'm using my right hand to play this game.
[116:10.98]You're using your left hand.
[116:11.76]You're used to your left hand being used.
[116:13.12]I got you.
[116:14.64]Anchor.
[116:15.10]Just keep it anchored.
[116:18.24]Think about that.
[116:19.46]I am not doing WASD because I can't.
[116:23.89]Just anchor when you need to.
[116:26.87]Yeah, we're going to need to do a spin jump.
[116:28.91]Why am I getting question marked?
[116:30.33]Were you here earlier?
[116:34.52]Dude, what?
[116:35.66]We need to... Okay, ready?
[116:44.07]Anchor.
[116:45.44]I'm...
[116:47.02]What is this about a left hand that your brain can't go to your fingers in your right arm?
[116:52.54]Aren't you right hand dominant?
[116:54.78]Muscle memory is... You're using WASD with your left hand.
[116:59.53]That is what you are used to using when you play a video game.
[117:02.83]Your right hand being on arrow keys is a different muscle memory.
[117:06.39]Can I give you a word of advice?
[117:09.03]No.
[117:10.63]Can you put your left hand on the arrow keys?
[117:13.69]But that's weird because I'm crossing my body and then I have to turn the key.
[117:17.47]That's weird.
[117:19.41]That's weird.
[117:21.98]At that point, I would have to move my seat.
[117:28.04]It's weird.
[117:28.92]People get it.
[117:29.44]Some of you get it.
[117:30.76]If you get it, you get it.
[117:32.66]If you don't, then... Are you dumb?
[117:39.71]wow alright alright you ready wow whoa whoa I don't know what we're doing can we make that jump I think we go to the bottom unless you want to try to get the top right let's try top right if we fall we fall okay let me get to where you are first though
[118:05.64]move the keyboard I don't have that's like I don't have room to do that alright anchor we're gonna okay as soon as this next wind ends we're gonna do the big jump stop fucking pulling me well what are you doing
[118:23.61]I need to get a full rotation so we can jump across.
[118:25.45]I know, but we have to wait till the wind is gone.
[118:27.64]Yeah, so why do you keep interrupting me?
[118:29.44]Because I'm getting the rotations going.
[118:32.60]Okay, you ready?
[118:33.34]Don't do it.
[118:33.94]I'm not going to.
[118:34.98]I'm ready.
[118:35.38]Because I can go while the wind's going for some reason.
[118:38.66]Okay, here we go.
[118:42.96]It was climb, climb.
[118:44.19]The chatter said you could climb.
[118:48.89]Hold it.
[118:49.19]Hold, hold, hold, hold.
[118:50.67]Oh, we're fine.
[118:51.05]We're fine.
[118:51.43]We're fine.
[118:51.67]We're fine.
[118:58.36]We're gonna go left, left.
[119:02.77]Just wait.
[119:04.33]Just wait.
[119:06.01]Oh my god, LOL, he fell off.
[119:11.65]What are you doing?
[119:13.66]Get up here.
[119:15.18]No, it's windy.
[119:23.92]Pull me, pull me, pull me.
[119:24.93]No, go down.
[119:33.18]Thanks for waiting on I see how much compensation I did there.
[119:37.28]Don't tell me I don't know what I'm doing.
[119:54.69]Uh, what?
[119:56.41]I think we can make that.
[119:58.32]I don't think we I don't go for a run, I think, right?
[120:14.70]okay okay we got we gotta remember we gotta double jump up the hill yes keep going yep oh you're so greedy I was just you I you I was listening to you greedy oh dude it's been it's been like so much fun how long we've been playing this game for oh wow like 16 hours

[120:56.07]I was just freaked out.
[121:03.31]I freaked out.
[121:04.07]You freak out sometimes too.
[121:05.27]We freak out sometimes.
[121:06.48]Everyone does a little freak out.
[121:12.01]Usually you time it.
[121:13.55]I'm just going to go back.
[121:15.79]Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:16.79]Just go back.
[121:18.71]You've timed it the last few times.
[121:22.17]Once the wind ends.
[121:23.35]I know, but you've done like the... I thought you were going to go for it.
[121:35.74]Greedy.
[121:36.40]Greedy!
[121:44.93]Ah, stay.
[121:47.73]You guys having fun?
[121:49.11]How you guys doing?
[121:49.89]You guys having fun?
[121:52.15]Everybody doing good?
[122:01.80]I actually read my chat.
[122:04.40]Oh, you're really going to pull that?
[122:09.07]I don't know what that means.
[122:10.11]I don't know what I'm threatening.
[122:12.99]What is this?
[122:14.93]We have to jump with the wind.
[122:16.91]Probably.
[122:17.91]And then I have to throw you with the wind.
[122:21.09]That's definitely what this is.
[122:27.20]Okay.
[122:27.78]So now I got to throw you with the wind.
[122:29.52]Hold on.
[122:29.74]Let me get in a better spot.
[122:32.16]Okay.
[122:33.28]Wait for the wind.
[122:34.30]I'm going to go when it starts to blow in three, two, one.
[122:39.36]Don't tell me no when I'm confident.
[122:42.96]Don't tell this guy no.
[122:43.92]Alright.
[122:49.82]Freeze.
[122:54.06]What do we do now?
[122:55.54]You're so sassy.
[122:57.69]I think that we jump on this platform.
[123:02.17]Nah.
[123:03.79]Hold on.
[123:05.63]We need to see how long it was going to stay there for.
[123:07.93]Why?
[123:08.59]We saw it six times.
[123:13.13]Oh, let's get one more rotation.
[123:15.90]I don't feel comfortable about this.
[123:18.42]You want to get it right or do you want to get it wrong and have people omega low and have a YouTube thumbnail?
[123:24.62]Pull me up.
[123:32.33]Is your refrigerator running?
[123:33.91]Yeah, I think so.
[123:47.91]I have to throw you.
[123:49.37]I got to throw you to that in the wind.
[123:50.79]You got to grab it and then we got to go.
[123:52.21]What the fuck just happened?
[123:54.85]Are you ready?
[123:57.85]One more.
[124:02.24]I won this thing moves in the wind.
[124:04.04]I don't think I'm going to be able to keep my momentum.
[124:06.86]Yeah, that kills it.
[124:08.40]So you're going to start when we're on our way to the left.
[124:11.84]I can't.
[124:12.78]We're not going to be able to get 360s, but the wind will take us further.
[124:16.61]Okay.
[124:17.83]So, right now.
[124:23.81]I think I played that alright.
[124:26.73]Is Lakitu up there?
[124:28.65]Yeah.
[124:34.59]This is ruining my morning.
[124:35.73]You both suck.
[124:37.15]What?
[124:46.31]Wait, what do you mean?
[124:48.05]Where are you?
[124:49.97]Where are you?
[124:51.18]Alright, ready?
[124:55.90]I'm like exhausted.
[124:59.52]I've been pushed to my limit.
[125:01.72]Are you alright?
[125:03.06]Alright, now I'm going to swing you.
[125:05.57]You ready?
[125:08.63]One more.
[125:10.45]Nope.
[125:17.11]One more.
[125:20.05]I gripped it!
[125:20.67]Why did that happen?
[125:22.51]I actually gripped it and he just went... I heard it.
[125:24.96]That does happen sometimes.
[125:27.44]That's why you need the Lakitu.
[125:29.64]Lakoto.
[125:31.10]I gripped it.
[125:31.74]We're going to instantly go.
[125:34.61]Instantly.
[125:35.01]That would be a bad idea.
[125:37.41]As soon as it comes down.
[125:44.21]So how?
[125:45.31]We need more momentum on this one.
[125:47.97]How do we get it?
[125:48.54]Because if I do it there, it won't work.
[125:56.76]Here we go.
[125:57.60]Give me one more.
[125:58.14]Give me one more.
[125:58.74]One more.
[125:59.02]You got it.
[126:00.76]My fingers fell off the muscle fucking.
[126:03.04]We're good.
[126:03.42]We landed.
[126:03.74]Oh my God.
[126:06.95]Why did we both just not do anything?
[126:08.77]That's not where we're going, right?
[126:15.09]That's not where we're going.
[126:16.15]That's where we've been.
[126:18.29]Alright, let me get it.
[126:26.84]Two more.
[126:28.40]One more right there.
[126:30.54]Alright, good.
[126:32.49]I can't, I can't.
[126:34.75]There you go.
[126:36.89]I can't, I can't.
[126:40.01]We gotta jump when the wind comes.
[126:41.35]Yep.
[126:47.34]Oh, no, no, no.
[126:49.40]Oh.
[126:50.22]Let's just walk the other way.
[126:52.60]But we didn't see what was up there.
[126:55.56]You were going to fall off, too.
[126:59.86]You were going to fall the fuck off.
[127:01.88]If I didn't fall, you're so happy that I fell.
[127:04.79]Our coordination has just gotten worse, and you think we'd get better at this shit.
[127:10.85]Let me just take a look and see what my hand looks like.
[127:13.55]Oh boy.
[127:14.63]That's, uh, that's not good.
[127:25.71]What is not good?
[127:27.55]I did a thing.
[127:32.46]Okay.
[127:33.68]That's millennial humor.
[127:36.24]Which both millennials.
[127:37.14]Okay.
[127:37.54]Sorry.
[127:41.20]Next one.
[127:43.61]That one wasn't right.
[127:44.51]Give me two more.
[127:54.58]Thank you.
[127:54.90]As soon as the next wind starts.
[127:59.12]So we're just going to go, go, go, go, go.
[128:02.52]Okay, you got it.
[128:02.98]Oh, Jesus.
[128:09.80]Alright.
[128:10.76]Now I got to throw you over there.
[128:18.15]Jesus, OK.
[128:25.83]This is probably thought we get right to 70.
[128:27.37]I I thought we I thought we're going to quit the game like an hour and a half ago.
[128:30.87]Alright, what's the plan here?
[128:33.81]Jump.
[128:36.48]Oh yeah.
[128:44.08]I can we make I don't know.
[128:47.74]I think we do the running one.
[128:48.60]From the other side.
[128:54.64]Nice.
[128:56.47]And then when the wind starts, we're going to have to do a jump.
[128:58.77]Yep.
[129:06.79]Whoa, I overshot it.
[129:10.78]The first time.
[129:11.90]Let's jump straight up.
[129:17.79]uh can we make the left one I gotta wait for the wind oops what are you doing as soon as the wind hits you it up I you didn't jump I did no you didn't but I was pulling you I was pulling you it's like off sync it's weird when I fall it's my fault when you fall it's weird a full straight run
[129:52.84]No.
[129:53.50]When the wind starts.
[129:54.08]When the wind starts.
[129:54.68]Alright.
[129:58.96]Just straight up.
[130:00.78]Straight up.
[130:01.12]When the wind starts.
[130:01.74]Uh-uh.
[130:09.95]Alright.
[130:15.99]You grabbing?
[130:16.83]Or am I grabbing?
[130:19.80]I think we can make the jump.
[130:20.64]Okay.
[130:21.58]Okay.
[130:24.17]I'll grab it.
[130:24.61]I'll grab it.
[130:26.10]You grab the other one.
[130:26.66]Okay, let go here.
[130:35.84]Oh, fuck.
[130:36.74]Yep.
[130:37.72]Good thing you were a little bit further.
[130:38.73]Alright, what's the plan here?
[130:44.13]I guess it's that.
[130:50.04]What?
[130:50.62]What?
[130:51.72]What?
[130:53.16]Trolled him.
[130:54.52]Just get us back.
[131:01.09]What?
[131:02.07]What?
[131:03.27]What?
[131:03.71]I want a burger.
[131:09.85]Sounds good.
[131:13.33]Double jump.
[131:16.77]Does it blow with the wind, I think?
[131:21.25]We gotta we gotta do it when it's above our head No shit that's weird what the heck I got you I got you baby boo-boo Can you pull me up?
[131:40.17]Alright, keep swinging I don't trust that.
[131:45.56]No, I'm I'm the swinger
[131:48.62]OK, I'm going to go right when we... Oh, no.
[131:52.42]I think you have to start doing it down here.
[131:53.72]Yeah, because the wind's going to mess it up.
[131:58.16]It's hitting my head on the corner is what it is.
[132:00.51]You want to move to the right a little more?
[132:02.21]I got it.
[132:02.57]OK, no.
[132:09.37]Let me move to the right a little bit more.
[132:11.07]OK.
[132:13.83]See if that does it.
[132:17.39]I I've got it.
[132:18.15]Trust trust OK.
[132:18.91]I'm gonna go on this one.
[132:23.56]OK.
[132:34.22]Oh no, what?
[132:40.50]Just go.
[132:43.86]Jump.
[132:45.08]Anchor.
[132:47.26]Anchor in this stanker.
[132:59.21]What?
[133:02.61]What the hell was that?
[133:04.56]What do you mean?
[133:06.28]That was kind of like a... I'm piecing together what you just said.
[133:11.60]I'm going on this one.
[133:12.28]We gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!
[133:23.82]okay uh after the wind yeah we should get a countdown there pink for the clouds purple for the mountains aha I'm starting to visualize it they're acting like it's hard to climb this and there's so many people up here solo I don't like that lore
[133:53.65]Okay.
[133:54.07]How much further is it, I wonder?
[133:55.47]Come here for a run and jump.
[134:01.29]Wait, we need the wind.
[134:02.31]And also, it seems like if you stand behind this wall, the wind doesn't affect you.
[134:06.46]Oh, it doesn't.
[134:06.90]Wait, I didn't.
[134:09.44]Oh, that was weird.
[134:09.92]I started late, so I decided to call it.
[134:13.62]Okay.
[134:13.92]When the wind starts.
[134:16.76]I called it.
[134:17.80]Yeah.
[134:19.18]You're for the best.
[134:19.78]You're not even on the ground.
[134:22.06]I got it.
[134:22.37]I got it.
[134:22.59]I got it.
[134:22.79]I got it.
[134:24.34]Alright.
[134:29.54]I thought we may have kept moving.
[134:32.62]Not risking it.
[134:34.32]Alright, so you grab and then you want me to grab the other side of the wall?
[134:38.51]Yeah, OK.
[134:40.49]Right now.
[134:42.27]Did wind.
[134:48.09]I'm at your grabbing right?
[134:49.17]You go, you go, you go.
[134:50.41]Alright, I'm going to grab the other side.
[134:58.19]What?
[134:59.05]That was a buggy bug bug.
[135:00.59]That was a bug bug bug.
[135:01.63]That was a bug.
[135:02.59]That was a bug.
[135:03.33]It was a bug.
[135:04.37]That was a bug.
[135:04.75]That was a bug.
[135:05.45]That was a bug.
[135:06.49]That was a bug.
[135:11.84]I wasn't even holding onto the side.
[135:17.44]Just go.
[135:17.92]Second one.
[135:26.21]Okay, I... Let's wait for this platform.
[135:31.27]Go.
[135:33.63]But do it good.
[135:34.77]Yeah, but dude, it's the first try.
[135:36.98]Don't worry, Lakitu's bringing us right back.
[135:38.50]Oh, first try.
[135:39.36]We're up 250 meters of this mountain.
[135:41.70]First try.
[135:42.36]We've never done this before.
[135:43.56]I was concerned that if I was going to throw you too far.
[135:56.82]Fucking dunce.
[135:57.98]That's not a dunce scenario.
[136:02.98]You didn't even anchor.
[136:03.84]I'm the dunce?
[136:07.02]You got up there and you stood there.
[136:08.30]I'm the dunce.
[136:09.67]I was expecting you to throw.
[136:10.81]I'm the dunce though.
[136:12.77]You got to let go of the wall.
[136:14.29]You didn't anchor.
[136:18.93]You dunce.
[136:19.95]I'm going to get it.
[136:25.88]No, you're not.
[136:29.58]What have you done?
[136:31.24]What have you done, you dunce?
[136:32.58]Okay, I've got this one.
[136:33.36]Got this one.
[136:35.26]What a dunce.
[136:36.90]You dunce.
[136:40.18]You fucking... We got this.
[136:50.39]Fast.
[136:50.75]This is easy.
[136:54.75]There.
[136:55.09]Nice.
[136:55.49]Nice job, dunce.
[136:58.31]I'm not gonna let this one go.
[137:01.00]We jump straight up.
[137:02.16]We swing up.
[137:02.65]We jump up.
[137:05.45]Watch that wind.
[137:06.21]Nice job watching the wind.
[137:11.31]Three, two, one, go.
[137:20.54]Pull me up.
[137:26.15]Thanks, dude.
[137:28.84]I feel bad.
[137:29.32]I was going to say moron, but he didn't deserve it.
[137:33.11]Wait, we need wind.
[137:33.69]You dunce.
[137:35.37]How are you going to make that jump without wind?
[137:46.61]You're doing the countdown.
[137:48.69]That doesn't mean you jump.
[137:51.73]He's doing the countdown.
[137:53.13]This countdown is real.
[137:57.69]Oh, you don't need it.
[138:02.44]That was slippery.
[138:04.80]It sure was Buster.
[138:07.70]We need a much bigger running start.
[138:29.67]Dunson duncer.
[138:37.05]Stay there.
[138:37.35]Alright, yeah, we need to... Okay, just chill here.
[138:49.42]And we're going to double jump.
[138:50.82]Wait.
[138:51.38]No, we're not.
[138:53.83]What are you... I would like to put evidence into the courtroom here.
[138:59.59]You said nowhere not and then got angry when I didn't go.
[139:04.01]We're going to jump to this one, but then we're going to stop there.
[139:13.80]Because we need to swing.
[139:14.70]This is too big of a jump.
[139:16.02]Yes, we do.
[139:24.72]I got it.
[139:32.77]What are you doing?
[139:33.97]Okay.
[139:37.35]That just fucked us up a little more.
[139:50.03]Let go.
[139:51.10]Can you get us back up?
[139:52.12]Where's Lakitu?
[139:52.84]How do I call him?
[139:54.92]I don't know.
[140:02.33]Let's just jump.
[140:03.11]Just jump.
[140:03.41]Just jump.
[140:11.32]What did I do?
[140:16.26]I put the... It's alright.
[140:17.76]Everybody relax.
[140:19.06]Everybody relax.
[140:21.78]Alright.
[140:35.85]Let me... We need a full revolution here for sure.
[140:42.58]we got oh just oh no no no I'm freaking out I'm freaking out just keep walking left okay we're good we're gonna we we gotta jump up to the left and then just we're gonna have to jump up to the left and then like get a little bit of a run yep so all all the way over okay let's I'll count it I'll count it down if we need to count it because we're connected to each other at the hip
[141:09.80]my god I wish we weren't or were okay that was always because it was because we're uh that's time it wasn't timed right I did it it just didn't do it it's hard
[141:33.08]Okay, just chill.
[141:34.16]Just chill.
[141:34.68]It's going to blow us off.
[141:35.58]Walk against it.
[141:38.08]Walk against it.
[141:39.48]You can't.
[141:39.94]It blows you off.
[141:41.26]Bro.
[141:42.46]It doesn't.
[141:43.40]It doesn't.
[141:44.20]It doesn't.
[141:44.54]Hey, check this out.
[141:45.12]Check this out.
[141:45.76]Bro.
[141:46.20]Look at this.
[141:46.56]Look at this.
[141:46.94]Look at this.
[141:47.54]Look at this.
[141:48.92]Look at this.
[141:50.21]Look at this.
[141:50.83]Look at this.
[141:51.15]Look at this.
[141:52.03]Okay.
[141:59.01]Hey, can you pull me up, dude?
[142:00.15]I fell off.
[142:08.20]Could you give me a little bit of a pull?
[142:13.74]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[142:16.11]If we don't do it this time... Hey, Fred.
[142:19.99]Hey, Fred.
[142:23.25]You fell off.
[142:24.87]You fell off because you decided to anchor instead of walking to the right on the ice.
[142:29.56]Can you say Barney loud for me?
[142:32.58]Barney!
[142:34.16]Barney?
[142:34.42]Barney?
[142:34.70]Barney?
[142:35.40]Barney?
[142:38.45]Party different.
[142:39.91]I think we gotta get back up to the top red.
[142:45.21]This is not even hard.
[142:46.79]We've done way harder things.
[142:52.91]Pretty good, yeah.
[142:54.83]Just wait, we've got the road.
[142:55.99]We're rushing through this.
[142:57.71]No, we're not.
[143:00.75]Read the wind.
[143:02.98]Once it starts.
[143:07.44]Do not anchor on ice.
[143:09.26]But sometimes it gives you an extra little boost.
[143:11.72]No.
[143:11.96]No.
[143:12.42]Nice, Mike.
[143:35.29]But you were silent.
[143:39.08]You were just like, Barney!
[143:43.26]Fred, you didn't say anything, Fred.
[143:45.78]You just said, we gotta get up there, Fred.
[144:00.52]Keep going.
[144:12.41]I'm ready.
[144:16.53]Somebody's calling me a piece of shit.
[144:20.55]Keep going.
[144:23.89]But here is the conundrum.
[144:26.09]You are way ahead of me.
[144:28.53]Do you get it now?
[144:29.89]No, because I'm throwing you, bro.
[144:34.19]I'm throwing you.
[144:35.27]I think we could just make this jump to the right.
[144:48.73]Yeah, when I throw you, you are like a full... You're a full rope length ahead of me.
[144:53.27]Alright, so we're gonna... We need a fully documented plan.
[145:07.88]I'm sending you the email right now.
[145:09.40]Okay, what's in it?
[145:10.40]What's the subject?
[145:15.45]Keep going.
[145:15.97]Just keep walking right.
[145:17.54]Don't anchor on ice.
[145:19.66]Keep going.
[145:20.74]Timing.
[145:23.04]Keep going.
[145:29.63]I got it.
[145:29.97]We're going left.
[145:30.51]We're going left.
[145:33.25]Anchor.
[145:33.97]You anchor.
[145:35.89]I don't.
[145:36.99]Do we need to do that?
[145:38.33]Yes.
[145:40.19]This is bad.
[145:41.29]This is going to be horrible.
[145:45.02]Oh, dear.
[145:47.09]Oh.
[145:47.63]Oh, bother.
[145:50.41]With the window.
[145:51.23]How much more time do you need?
[145:52.91]I'm just trying to figure out if it's with the window.
[145:54.47]I feel like I'm going to go flying past this.
[145:57.87]Oh, bother.
[146:16.44]Okay.
[146:18.91]Regular drone?
[146:22.43]Let's wait for the wind.
[146:26.29]Uh-huh.
[146:29.16]Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!
[146:32.74]Wow!
[146:34.84]Wow!
[146:35.60]Wow!
[146:36.90]Wow!
[146:38.10]Come on!
[146:39.18]Come on!
[146:48.61]That was like a fucking witch.
[146:54.84]That was a fucking witch.
[146:56.16]That was like a fucking fairy tale witch.
[147:00.92]I've got you in my cauldron.
[147:04.14]Alright, we're going to do three, two, one, go.
[147:06.25]I need a second after that one.
[147:07.57]That was fucked.
[147:11.25]Oh, that was fucking crazy.
[147:14.51]That was fucked up.
[147:15.65]Oh.
[147:20.16]You got this I'm ready.
[147:22.02]Are you ready?
[147:32.81]It's been doing like the Family Guy fall down thing Once the wind hits Right
[147:50.95]I don't know what do we do there I think we're doing it wrong we can both jump and grab the wall ah but why so that's the thing the floor doesn't break when the wind comes when the wind comes
[148:19.68]Now what?
[148:21.50]Oh, what a smart.
[148:24.05]You got it.
[148:24.55]Oh, we got a smart ass over here.
[148:29.77]You are kind of a... No, you're not.
[148:31.67]You're fine.
[148:35.00]No.
[148:45.89]I know, but I just thought of like the grimace birth thing again.
[148:49.89]And it's like fucking with me.
[148:55.83]His birthday is a month long.
[148:58.43]What the?
[148:59.05]I don't even know what to say.
[149:00.89]Okay.
[149:05.79]Say less.
[149:08.76]Okay.
[149:13.66]Is this a throw scenario?
[149:15.38]Yeah.
[149:18.22]uh I'm gonna move up a little no actually we're good no right keep walking right keep walking right I am I am oh I don't know what you did I forgot to give the second instruction stop walking right
[149:46.82]Hey, what if I threw him right now?
[149:53.57]Go.
[150:00.77]I forgot to give the second instruction.
[150:02.47]Stop walking right.
[150:04.73]Yeah, I. OK, so let's like just like pause when we're on the ice, because apparently we're doing a lot of Jermapause reps.
[150:12.46]I love how this all comes back to me doing this somehow.
[150:22.59]PAUSE!
[150:23.61]PAUSE!
[150:34.54]Nice.
[150:35.70]Smooth.
[150:37.50]Smooth.
[150:43.14]No.
[150:43.68]No, no, no, no.
[150:44.40]The winds are here.
[150:45.14]Coward, coward, coward, coward, coward, coward, coward, coward, coward.
[150:49.61]It says three, two, one, go!
[150:51.70]That's when you go!
[150:52.34]Just give it a second.
[150:55.58]We don't have to go that fast.
[150:58.89]Did you shave your eyebrows?
[151:01.15]No, I probably need to.
[151:02.11]I probably need to do some cleanup on my eyebrows, though.
[151:03.97]They're probably fucking filthy.
[151:18.34]one of us don't talk don't I want to hear I don't hear it don't talk we're gonna do this oh I let go that's a lot of talking
[151:51.42]Okay.
[151:55.77]I hate this.
[151:56.63]I hate this.
[151:56.95]We're going back.
[151:57.49]This is totally an optional room.
[151:59.79]I don't think it is.
[152:03.97]I think it is.
[152:05.63]I think we're waiting for the wind here to jump left.
[152:07.61]Okay.
[152:08.59]You say so.
[152:09.05]I'm going to do a trick.
[152:20.60]Where do we go from?
[152:21.46]This is going to be a tough one.
[152:26.00]It is.
[152:26.22]We just wait for the wind and we just do it normally.
[152:31.07]Like this.
[152:34.55]Dunce.
[152:37.30]You goober.
[152:59.76]We got an achievement for that?
[153:00.66]Yeah.
[153:01.53]Yeah.
[153:06.59]How did we both miss that?
[153:10.31]Call the taxi, whatever it is.
[153:13.87]Hey, me lords, have you tried waiting for each other to jump?
[153:20.25]You have a dent in your head?
[153:21.15]I don't know, probably.
[153:24.15]What?
[153:24.33]That gets you going?
[153:25.75]Was that you reading a comment?
[153:27.24]Because I thought you were responding to that person.
[153:29.36]I was like, that's... He wouldn't usually go in like that.
[153:32.94]I thought you meant that was... You thought I was talking to you.
[153:36.54]No, you read the comment.
[153:38.08]The guy said, why don't you try waiting to jump?
[153:40.37]And you were just like, hey, you got a dent in your head.
[153:42.39]What?
[153:47.25]I didn't realize it was a back-to-back comment read.
[153:52.29]That's true.
[153:52.81]That sounded so fucked up.
[153:54.47]That was fucked up.
[154:04.62]Oh, that's so funny.
[154:08.26]Okay, you ready?
[154:11.05]What am I ready for?
[154:12.25]The arc continuation of the Let's Play.
[154:18.07]Okay, ready?
[154:19.31]Yeah.
[154:21.15]Stop trashing.
[154:23.03]He's turning purple.
[154:26.25]Where's my countdown?
[154:28.45]Oh.
[154:30.03]Oh, sensory overload.
[154:30.89]The wind's not even here, you dolt.
[154:35.54]Sensory overload.
[154:36.54]It's not my fault.
[154:38.28]There's too many noises.
[154:39.24]What do you have?
[154:41.38]What do you have?
[154:42.10]A death in your head?
[154:47.89]That's so fucking rude.
[154:49.75]That's so fucking horrible.
[154:57.73]Why can't we do this anymore?
[154:59.03]I think we gotta jump a little later.
[155:02.22]We're being very conservative with our jump.
[155:08.34]Okay.
[155:18.10]how is your hair middle and side parted what I don't get it I don't get it you got a dent in your head I don't know maybe is it is it I can't I need to look I got I got it I got it hold hold hold hold here
[155:41.65]Stop fucking around.
[155:43.89]What do you mean, stop fucking around?
[155:45.83]You just fell off twice, and you've been around so much.
[155:48.30]Stop fucking around.
[155:49.58]I'm the spinner.
[155:51.04]Yeah, but we need to assess what's going on with the situation ahead of us.
[155:57.06]There is a... Okay, I get it.
[156:00.16]You ready?
[156:01.42]I've been ready.
[156:02.76]I wasn't, though, and it's a team game.
[156:04.50]I've been ready.
[156:06.96]It's a team game, and I wasn't.
[156:11.02]That was so hard.
[156:12.21]I didn't think we were going to make it.
[156:16.85]I can't believe you did the tutorial of Red Dead 2 and just were like, this game's dumb.
[156:21.27]I didn't finish it.
[156:23.32]I just saved your life.
[156:24.86]Well, we should have double jumped.
[156:26.64]Why?
[156:26.94]Because we're on a fucking time limit.
[156:32.56]Go, go.
[156:34.79]Oh, this is it.
[156:35.35]We're almost at the end.
[156:45.52]What are you doing?
[156:51.22]Alright, the ghost took over the computer for a second.
[156:53.20]What are you doing?
[156:55.98]I was wondering if that was affecting you.
[156:58.42]Huh?
[156:59.94]I was adjusting my music volume.
[157:02.83]Oh, I turned it way down already.
[157:03.79]3, 2, 1, go!
[157:13.91]I bumped my head on it.
[157:19.52]Oh, you want to go?
[157:20.72]No.
[157:21.30]No, you said stay in our lanes, right?
[157:23.32]Like, do what we know what we're doing.
[157:28.27]With the... Without.
[157:29.17]It's definitely without.
[157:31.61]Or is it?
[157:31.99]Is it with or without?
[157:33.83]It's with.
[157:35.33]Wait.
[157:36.47]It might not be.
[157:39.93]I guess it is.
[157:40.37]Okay.
[157:42.78]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[157:43.58]Pull me up.
[157:44.02]Pull me up.
[157:46.44]I'm a little baby.
[157:49.00]Yeah.
[157:51.04]Oh, I see.
[157:51.82]You want to put a checkpoint after every jump now because you want to be done with this game that you despise so much.
[157:58.46]I got you.
[157:58.84]Yep.
[158:02.46]Holy shit.
[158:03.64]Okay.
[158:04.56]Because look at you.
[158:06.44]Look at you.
[158:07.88]Look in the mirror.
[158:09.98]I wouldn't be able to finish this with you ever.
[158:11.76]Literally ever.
[158:12.42]I'm looking in the mirror.
[158:13.34]What is it?
[158:13.64]Something in my face?
[158:16.86]What's with the fucking hair?
[158:17.64]I have to double part.
[158:18.54]What's going on?
[158:20.80]I think we could practice this game for an eternity.
[158:26.00]And without checkpoints.
[158:29.20]It would never end.
[158:33.96]I felt the same way about the game only up.
[158:37.28]And it was so hard.
[158:39.48]And then I started watching people do like... 15 minute speedruns of that game.
[158:44.25]And that was on you.
[158:45.57]That was.
[158:45.93]I don't know where we're going after that.
[158:47.65]TBH.
[158:55.95]Whoa, that was weird.
[158:59.04]I've been comparing only up to Dark and Darker.
[159:02.02]And I can see how you would like them both.
[159:05.62]What?
[159:07.93]What do you mean explain?
[159:09.67]I don't think I should.
[159:11.51]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[159:18.88]What do you mean explain?
[159:21.28]Sorry I wasn't paying attention.
[159:23.12]They're both unfinished streamer bait trash.
[159:36.11]Yeah, OK.
[159:39.61]Okay.
[159:39.71]It's been in the wrong way.
[159:52.20]Alright, just hold tight.
[159:53.00]Hold me up.
[159:54.82]Okay, now where are we going?
[159:56.42]Against the wind, right?
[159:57.04]When it comes, go left.
[159:58.00]Nice.
[160:00.13]Okay, okay.
[160:04.99]Okay, um... I mean, but... Can I ask you a question?
[160:10.15]Yeah.
[160:10.45]And you have to answer honestly?
[160:11.41]Mm-hmm.
[160:13.01]Can you name me three games that have come out in the last five years that you genuinely, really enjoyed?
[160:18.87]I could very... Yeah.
[160:20.63]What are they?
[160:22.49]Hold on.
[160:24.32]Without looking up a, like, Google sheet of the game... No, I'm trying to look up something else.
[160:29.02]Did you play Betten Brutal?
[160:30.64]No.
[160:32.02]Exactly.
[160:35.19]I rest my case.
[160:36.97]Okay.
[160:37.63]Oh, only up.
[160:38.45]I love only up.
[160:39.43]I've got to check out the speed runs.
[160:40.61]Oh, NFT.
[160:41.67]Did I play Benton Brutal?
[160:42.95]No.
[160:44.11]I played only up for like four hours once.
[160:47.53]Exactly.
[160:48.82]When did I say that only up was the game of the year?
[160:53.10]What did I say game of the year?
[160:56.46]I said name a few games in the last five years that you genuinely enjoyed.
[161:01.30]In the last five years?
[161:02.92]Yeah, name like three.
[161:04.74]Do they have to have released in the last five years, or can I enjoy them now?
[161:08.14]Yeah, like a game that's come out in the last, let's say, three years.
[161:11.18]That you really were like, wow, I really enjoyed that.
[161:15.44]You got to name me at least three.
[161:18.60]Elden Ring.
[161:20.74]Q Remastered.
[161:22.56]Risk of Rain 2.
[161:23.08]Torchlight Infinite.
[161:28.09]You told me in private that you didn't like it.
[161:30.17]Didn't like what?
[161:30.75]Torchlight.
[161:33.15]I didn't.
[161:37.70]uh you're you're weird can I tell you why you're weird why am I weird because you'll like okay I brought up like Pizza Tower right yeah and I was like Pizza Tower oh you should really try it I think it's like one of the best games to come out this year and you played it and you were like don't ever recommend me a game ever again that's that's not what I said I just said it wasn't for me I respect Pizza Tower but it is not for me
[162:07.27]Okay, it may have been more dramatic at the time.
[162:10.54]It was a little dramatic at the time.
[162:13.40]Hey, why are we going to have this whole conversation when I brought up Diablo 4 Season 1 earlier?
[162:17.60]You didn't want to talk then.
[162:20.08]Oh, Gemma's just a hater.
[162:24.06]Beloved game.
[162:25.42]Beloved.
[162:25.92]Diablo 4, one of the greatest entries in the Diablo series.
[162:28.42]Beloved.
[162:28.82]Oh, you don't want to talk about it?
[162:31.75]Just...
[162:33.34]I just got really sick and tired of picking up Saigon's boots over and over and over again.
[162:38.56]You fucking wish that game would drop Saigon's boots.
[162:41.50]Yeah.
[162:47.91]Yeah.
[162:52.43]Let's go.
[162:59.82]Ster has horrid opinions.
[163:01.22]I don't think Ster has horrid opinions.
[163:06.00]Ster and I actually agree on quite a lot.
[163:08.74]Chat, you're dying on the hill of Only Up, a game that's getting fucking like destroyed for like non-fair use NFT shit in their game.
[163:18.13]You're dying on the hill of like, no, Only Up was good.
[163:20.45]What do you mean?
[163:21.27]It's fun.
[163:22.39]Hold on.
[163:23.07]Hold on.
[163:23.63]Hold on.
[163:24.43]The game was fun.
[163:25.47]I enjoyed it.
[163:26.49]But the counterpoint is Ben Brutal is the exact same game without all of the shovelware aspects, but you didn't try that and you tried the shovelware.
[163:39.46]that's all I'm saying nobody died on that hill you're fighting ghosts you're fighting ghosts you're fighting ghosts I'm just saying two very similar games came out in a very similar time frame and one of them deserves a an ounce of respect and you picked the wrong one
[164:02.74]I'll translate for those of you that don't know Ster.
[164:06.40]He fell off the pipes and all dead for it.
[164:08.58]Get good.
[164:10.70]This is the I fell off the pipes and didn't want to go back up.
[164:15.58]Got him.
[164:17.72]This is drama destroying the environment by supporting.
[164:20.75]Okay, you ready?
[164:24.71]Okay, let's go.
[164:29.53]I forgot to press down.
[164:32.59]Three, two.
[164:33.55]No, wait, I was.
[164:35.19]If you were watching my stream, I wasn't even on camera.
[164:44.03]Next time it touches down.
[164:45.01]Yep.
[164:49.20]Nice.
[164:51.30]Next time it touches up, we're running right.
[164:56.94]Oh, I quit in favelas.
[165:01.37]I'm here with you.
[165:02.19]I'm tied to you.
[165:02.95]We're playing it.
[165:04.65]Whatever happened to next time when it goes up?
[165:07.45]We're in the middle of like a divorce level argument right now.
[165:10.67]So I need a second.
[165:12.15]Next time.
[165:14.05]Oh, my fingers slipped.
[165:15.79]Oh, my fingers are slippery.
[165:17.70]What's all that?
[165:18.14]I got like oil on my fingers.
[165:19.42]What happened?
[165:22.36]Yeah, when you're focusing on pulling me only up.
[165:26.74]Oh, he liked it.
[165:34.76]You didn't do it.
[165:36.94]You were never going to make that jump and you're counting on me to have made the jump so that you don't look dumb.
[165:44.60]This kid didn't even make it up the pipes.
[165:53.86]It's also about season one.
[166:01.30]Let's hear about it.
[166:03.40]I got someone to be in like... I got someone to be... Are you breaking up?
[166:08.86]Are you on a good cell signal?
[166:09.94]Are you breaking up?
[166:15.38]Yeah, name five games.
[166:18.34]Super Mario 1, Super Mario 2, Super Mario World, Super Mario 3, Super Mario 64.
[166:24.24]Best games of all time.
[166:25.78]Not even a fucking contention.
[166:28.42]Competition.
[166:33.33]Did you beat Super Mario World for SNES?
[166:39.61]Yes.
[166:40.57]Thank God.
[166:41.17]Actually.
[166:41.81]Thank God, actually.
[166:45.89]Let's move that flag.
[166:52.71]Next time it touches down.
[166:58.55]I got you.
[166:58.99]I got you.
[166:59.33]I got you.
[166:59.71]I made it.
[167:04.19]Did you see the Mario movie?
[167:07.43]It was funny when I did it.
[167:15.07]And why are we counting now?
[167:16.71]Why are we counting?
[167:20.27]You... Ster.
[167:24.28]That sounds like there's a bird in your room.
[167:25.90]I don't know if I heard what I heard was correct, but be careful out there.
[167:28.28]I heard a very large bird potentially.
[167:30.18]You alright?
[167:30.54]You there?
[167:31.68]Duck.
[167:34.21]Alright, you ready?
[167:34.65]When it comes down.
[167:38.35]Crouch.
[167:40.08]Next time we go up, I'm going to count it down.
[167:43.66]Freaks are greasy.
[167:45.80]You didn't even go on looking.
[167:47.18]Look what I'm doing here.
[167:48.48]Look what I'm doing.
[167:50.04]I see what you're doing.
[167:51.41]I certainly see what you're doing.
[167:53.25]OK, what's the plan here?
[167:59.37]Fuck if I know and.
[168:03.60]we come back yeah we need we need one of these too you can't put them here yeah put them on ice okay so we need running start to okay good okay I like how we both just sit so we're going right pop right pop after the next wind we're beating this
[168:36.50]I thought you were going to do a countdown.
[168:39.02]After the next wind.
[168:43.20]Can you jump?
[168:43.84]Can you contribute?
[168:45.40]Pull me.
[168:45.90]You're not doing the poll animation.
[168:51.06]Sorry, there's no signal in the tunnel.
[168:53.28]Okay, I guess I'll count it down for you.
[169:08.00]Nice.
[169:08.26]Alright, what the heck?
[169:15.51]Once it gets here.
[169:17.45]Yeah.
[169:19.21]Then we can go up and then duck.
[169:26.96]And then I have to throw you to the left, I think.
[169:31.33]I think this is a throw.
[169:32.87]I think this might... Is it a throw?
[169:35.30]Why not?
[169:35.96]Why not just... Why not just go all out?
[169:39.22]Show me your true power.
[169:40.44]I think it was a throw.
[169:48.34]It's 500.
[169:48.99]We're almost there.
[169:49.59]And then you can go play Diablo 4.
[169:52.35]So we all know you're fucking huge.
[169:54.39]You love that game.
[169:57.75]Wow, apparently I like games now.
[170:00.88]Apparently, I like games now.
[170:08.05]Good save, actually.
[170:09.01]I don't know if this gets us anywhere, though.
[170:14.23]I think it kind of does.
[170:21.28]Oh, we're going to have to jump next wind, I think.
[170:24.76]That makes sense to me.
[170:27.36]Oh, yeah.
[170:31.93]I was going by timing.
[170:32.71]Why are you guys fighting?
[170:42.11]Ster and I are very comfortable hanging out.
[170:45.98]We can just, you know, rifle off.
[170:47.82]Yeah, I think we have a pretty good dynamic.
[170:50.64]We've known each other for a long time.
[170:52.98]I think we have a good dynamic.
[170:53.96]What do you think?
[170:59.36]We have a great dynamic.
[171:01.49]we have a great dynamic we we know we know who is who we know who's wearing the fucking shoes in the relationship pants that why what are you counting down what were you counting down what were you doing
[171:18.70]You knew that was a bad countdown.
[171:20.66]The next jump timed perfectly after the wind ended?
[171:24.19]You knew that was a bad countdown.
[171:26.63]You timed that wrong and you knew it.
[171:27.97]That's why you were quiet.
[171:28.91]Usually, you'd have been like, Jarbo, you're stupid.
[171:31.21]But that time, you were dead silent.
[171:33.47]Because I thought we've been doing this for like 14 hours.
[171:37.08]You ready?
[171:41.50]On the next wind, can you notice the wind occurring?
[171:44.78]Then we can just do it.
[171:50.70]Same exact thing we did last time.
[171:57.24]Three, two, one, go.
[172:00.80]It wasn't going to work out that way.
[172:02.86]Oh, it wasn't?
[172:04.14]No, we didn't do it before.
[172:05.08]It wasn't going to work out that way.
[172:08.86]Bro, take a nap.
[172:09.48]You look tired.
[172:10.14]I mean, I am, but how dare you?
[172:22.27]I think that's because we're doing that when the wind comes.
[172:24.29]I think so.
[172:26.86]Three, two, one.
[172:28.50]Uh-uh.
[172:30.74]Zero.
[172:33.20]I don't think we need the wind for this.
[172:35.94]I think you're putting overwind compensation in here.
[172:39.22]I'm putting overwind.
[172:40.34]Okay, the wind's going to end.
[172:42.08]I'm going to count it down, and we're going to definitely just slam right into this wall.
[172:55.14]Okay, this one's a no winder.
[172:57.84]No, we can't.
[172:58.41]There's no way to no wind.
[172:59.59]Okay, okay.
[173:02.77]This has to be wind.
[173:03.77]I'm sorry.
[173:04.15]I had that wrong.
[173:06.61]Uh-huh.
[173:15.60]Can you let go?
[173:16.06]No.
[173:18.06]What do you mean no?
[173:22.00]I wasn't actually holding it.
[173:23.38]Oh.
[173:24.04]What?
[173:24.32]That's weird.
[173:24.64]Alright.
[173:25.78]By the way, dude, I'm, uh, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry that I got that wrong.
[173:33.41]I'm sorry I had that wrong.
[173:34.09]It's so fucking hard to do that.
[173:39.91]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[173:47.61]Like, you... I can't apologize.
[173:49.19]I can't do it.
[173:53.17]Okay, let's go now.
[173:57.68]My nose is so itchy, dude.
[173:58.84]I'm sorry.
[174:02.36]How did you get across your room in one second?
[174:04.34]That was weird.
[174:14.91]Pull me up so we can fly up there.
[174:21.77]What do you mean?
[174:22.51]You're supposed to be pressing the fly up there button.
[174:32.76]Okay.
[174:41.06]Good, good, good.
[174:42.28]Alright, this is it.
[174:44.72]The final 50 meters.
[174:51.01]I dare you to read this.
[174:52.39]Look, another pair of penguins.
[174:53.55]These guys have to have it.
[174:57.29]Hey, good day, guys.
[174:59.21]Have you brought it?
[175:00.63]We, well, we got all the way here and realized we didn't bring it.
[175:05.70]We would have come home as victorious heroes, but no.
[175:10.60]They've had to leave the most important thing at home.
[175:13.89]Are you going to remind me for the rest of our lives?
[175:16.49]Yes, I will.
[175:17.23]Maybe then you won't forget everything.
[175:18.67]Do you even remember my name?
[175:19.87]I don't want to read this anymore.
[175:27.11]Wait.
[175:32.24]Come here.
[175:33.04]No, shut up.
[175:33.54]People were mad that I skipped it.
[175:34.68]Shut up.
[175:36.86]It looked like a secret in there.
[175:38.08]I'm sorry for saying shut up.
[175:41.72]I didn't mean that.
[175:44.97]Alright, this is it.
[175:46.05]Wait.
[175:47.81]Oh, you have, okay, you have one over there.
[175:50.43]Checkpoint.
[175:53.98]Three.
[175:55.40]No.
[175:55.64]Alright, I gotta throw you, I think.
[176:00.20]Yep.
[176:00.46]This is gonna be weird because how are we gonna do this from here?
[176:05.29]do what from here like you're gonna have to land and then we have to you have to land right on that snow part on the left otherwise we're not gonna be able to do it just like that don't worry I got it on the left if you landed on the ice we would have not been able to do it there's no way you're gonna throw it all the way to the ice yes there is if you were unskilled like I'm not the wind doesn't affect you up here yeah but I don't want to get blown okay
[176:36.51]And this this might need like a little bit of a run.
[176:42.74]That's.
[176:44.56]You had it wrong.
[176:46.20]How did I have it wrong?
[176:47.18]We were going to make that jump.
[176:48.04]See I- I should have done the timing on that one.
[176:56.94]You haven't done the time-
[176:58.43]What have you done?
[176:59.00]What have I done?
[176:59.75]What have you done? You've actually done something very very bad. You've done something you've done something incredibly bad.
[177:05.00]What have I done?
[177:06.00]I don't know what you did, but you've done something bad and now we have to do that. It's alright, it's gonna take us right there. What have you done?
[177:13.00]What have I done?
[177:14.00]I don't know, what have you done? You did something bad.
[177:16.00]What have I- what have I done?
[177:18.00]Okay - it's it's salvageable. I think it's salvageable, it's salvageable we just gotta-
[177:26.05]Oh, he is absolutely floundering right now.
[177:28.07]He's like falling off stuff.
[177:30.21]He's in shock.
[177:30.79]We gotta, we gotta... Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, I like games.
[177:33.73]Okay, it's alright.
[177:34.43]We're good.
[177:34.67]No, it's fine.
[177:34.95]We're good.
[177:38.87]Let's run against the wind.
[177:39.79]We're okay.
[177:42.18]It's okay.
[177:42.66]It's alright.
[177:43.28]I'm... Jerma, what have I done?
[177:45.86]It's everything's gonna be fine.
[177:46.54]Don't worry.
[177:47.40]Everything's gonna be fine.
[177:51.24]It's gonna be fine.
[177:51.78]Everything's gonna be alright.
[177:57.67]Just take it.
[177:58.45]It's only four.
[177:59.09]We were at 450, 440.
[178:00.73]This is not a problem.
[178:02.70]It's really not a problem.
[178:05.36]Don't go.
[178:08.36]We need to hit this perfect as the wind ends.
[178:11.84]Otherwise, we're going to get caught again.
[178:13.86]So perfect wind ending timing.
[178:16.58]Okay.
[178:19.90]Yeah, this is not a problem.
[178:20.64]We're fine.
[178:26.67]There's no wind here.
[178:29.97]I'm the anchor.
[178:31.23]I got you.
[178:37.27]And you're wrong.
[178:37.95]There's one here.
[178:49.94]432, we're already back.
[178:57.17]I'm not going to blame you on that.
[179:00.28]Again, how about you time one?
[179:02.42]Let's see how good it goes.
[179:03.82]I don't even know what the button is.
[179:07.14]It was like four on the numpad.
[179:08.50]I don't know what it is now.
[179:09.19]That's how hard it is.
[179:10.07]You don't even know the button and I'm getting critiques.
[179:14.95]Why would both of us do it?
[179:17.29]One of us has to take the charge on it.
[179:18.72]Are you going to swing it?
[179:22.83]I am so mentally just like... I was like, what does he mean?
[179:28.31]Okay, but if we get to 500 from here, that's the end of the game.
[179:33.38]We beat it.
[179:34.22]And yeah, we cheated along the way, but who cares?
[179:36.58]We're good.
[179:39.58]We're good.
[179:39.88]We're good.
[179:40.22]This is perfect.
[179:44.08]Dude, I tried so hard.
[179:47.47]And gone so far.
[179:57.08]did it again fine we're gonna be we're gonna handle this three two one go you're rushing a little because I know we have the potential to succeed you're rushing just a little okay no wind ice wait for wind next jump
[180:27.59]I said wait.
[180:28.41]I said wait.
[180:28.97]I said wait.
[180:31.39]I said wait.
[180:32.07]But didn't you say no wind, jump, then wait?
[180:34.76]You did say wait for wind.
[180:37.36]Because if... Because if the wind's going...
[180:53.70]We're just not meant for each other.
[180:56.07]I admit it.
[180:56.45]We needed to just wait a little longer.
[181:03.19]Just don't put one of those checkpoints down here.
[181:09.40]You call the shots, man.
[181:10.64]Okay, you ready?
[181:11.18]Yep.
[181:15.62]I didn't... You didn't hear anything.
[181:17.48]Are we waiting after the next one?
[181:19.14]Here's what we're going to do.
[181:20.61]Ready?
[181:20.75]Ready?
[181:23.92]Get up.
[181:24.88]And... No, no, no, no.
[181:25.98]Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[181:27.70]Go.
[181:29.56]I fucked up.
[181:30.26]That was my bad.
[181:31.06]No, I just... I don't know what the button is.
[181:40.70]Okay, there we go.
[181:41.80]Put one of those things down.
[181:42.68]Can't.
[181:46.90]Can't.
[181:48.12]Well, we'll just wait.
[181:48.60]Put it down here.
[181:56.51]There we go.
[181:58.73]Oh, fuck.
[182:01.69]We might be able to get this thing.
[182:17.29]Nice.
[182:18.01]Oh, my baby boy with his little goatee and his rock friend.
[182:22.68]Jeff is going to be my partner for the journey.
[182:24.92]That's the single player.
[182:26.75]Oh, cool.
[182:27.15]Alright, here we are.
[182:31.09]We're fine.
[182:32.03]Everything's good.
[182:32.71]Put one of those down.
[182:35.03]Mine was the real one.
[182:36.23]50 meters and we're good.
[182:37.75]Now I'm going to throw you.
[183:01.74]Just call a taxi.
[183:03.58]Call a taxi.
[183:07.87]Okay.
[183:23.58]And go.
[183:27.24]Call me up.
[183:31.90]Okay.
[183:35.44]There's nothing here.
[183:36.18]There's no wind here.
[183:36.80]We're good.
[183:39.08]Good idea.
[183:46.28]That one's hard to time.
[183:47.84]We're going to go a lot earlier.
[183:50.86]Yeah.
[183:53.62]I'm saying like we go like now.
[183:56.71]Yep.
[183:59.13]It's too hard to time with the counter.
[184:01.99]It's a very obvious one to go.
[184:03.52]I think we should do it.
[184:04.50]Let's go for it.
[184:05.34]Okay, when it comes up.
[184:18.19]Okay.
[184:19.49]Ready?
[184:20.27]Yes, that's perfect.
[184:33.07]Oh, no.
[184:37.57]Can you get me?
[184:38.63]Yeah.
[184:40.97]Okay.
[184:43.97]So what are we... Now.
[184:45.76]No.
[184:45.88]What are we doing after we get on that?
[184:48.92]Okay.
[184:49.32]We're going... Then we got to jump to that little block immediately?
[184:53.84]Yeah.
[184:54.42]I have to grab and then we'll... Okay.
[184:57.16]I think we have to throw from there.
[185:00.52]That was that was just not it was at the time it was wrong.
[185:03.48]Yeah, but we still had to go.
[185:04.86]We still had to.
[185:06.80]We literally had to.
[185:07.90]We're good.
[185:21.03]Well, the wind wind all the wind bro.
[185:26.17]The wind.
[185:34.01]OK, hold on.
[185:37.15]Because we need a no wind situation.
[185:39.71]We do need no wind.
[185:42.92]OK, this one.
[185:46.28]Sit no, we can't.
[185:47.78]OK, the no wind and then we immediately go up to the next one.
[185:51.38]Alright, no wind.
[185:52.64]Immediate next one.
[185:53.44]Are you grabbing or am I?
[185:54.66]Are you grabbing?
[185:56.84]I'm grabbing.
[185:57.20]Whoever can grab can grab.
[185:58.56]Alright, then I need to let you go when let go on this one.
[186:04.52]that was just that was it's hard to do that wow and I I didn't want you to run out of breath holding that's actually tricky that one's very hard okay we need to wait are you grabbing or am I grabbing you're grabbing go
[186:28.27]Again, we have to go immediately because when the wind comes back... Yeah, we have to go.
[186:33.76]Honey, we have to go.
[186:34.40]I feel you.
[186:38.68]Not this time because wind.
[186:39.84]And we have to immediately go to block.
[186:42.94]And then I'm grabbing.
[186:45.53]Yes.
[186:45.73]Okay, ready one.
[186:48.93]I have to wait for the wind to end.
[186:50.35]Yep.
[186:53.72]Okay, this time.
[186:54.30]Nice.
[186:56.51]And then where am I going from here?
[186:58.29]All the way left, I guess.
[187:00.99]How the fuck would you do that?
[187:02.67]You're hitting the weirdest swings.
[187:06.81]We need wind.
[187:07.38]You have to let me go.
[187:09.78]I know, but your swings were such shit.
[187:13.02]Censor yourself.
[187:14.92]Your swings were such bad swings.
[187:20.89]You're going to say, say, shoot instead of that word.
[187:25.32]What the?
[187:27.42]Okay.
[187:27.76]Anybody watching?
[187:29.80]This is tough.
[187:32.92]Are you looking for full revolutions when I get on there?
[187:36.34]Don't go.
[187:39.62]I mean, yeah, that would help a lot.
[187:41.92]Okay.
[187:43.02]Because you were going like upright and then not swinging down.
[187:45.56]You're like dropping down and yanking on the rope.
[187:48.64]Keep in mind, that is the fourth time I've ever done that.
[187:55.74]Bro, you accepted your smurf diagnosis?
[187:57.84]What?
[188:09.13]Wait.
[188:11.13]This next one, immediately jump on, immediately grab the block.
[188:23.91]Nope.
[188:27.44]Oh, I think it would.
[188:30.50]That one isn't something that breaks, so maybe I should just land on it and drop a flag.
[188:35.12]Not a bad idea.
[188:39.29]Landing on it's hard though.
[188:43.37]This one we're doing it.
[188:44.03]We're doing it.
[188:44.33]We're doing it.
[188:44.63]Alright, you let me you want me to let you go on the top.
[188:51.33]I go and you want to get above it.
[188:54.76]OK, nice.
[188:57.32]You can just pull me up now, yeah.
[188:58.70]There's no wind up here, right?
[188:59.68]Oh, there is.
[189:00.66]There is.
[189:01.68]Alright, now what the hell are we doing?
[189:04.20]Are we just running and jumping?
[189:05.46]Or are you swinging?
[189:07.96]I think I'm swinging.
[189:09.24]Can you swing from down here, though?
[189:11.83]That might be too thick.
[189:14.35]What do you mean?
[189:16.45]I mean, if I throw you, isn't that... Is it too thick?
[189:18.53]No, it's alright.
[189:23.59]Needed a little more oomph.
[189:27.95]Imagine this without flags.
[189:29.47]Yeah, I know.
[189:29.85]It'd be horrible.
[189:31.21]Okay, here we go.
[189:42.00]This is tricky because there's not a whole lot of room for me to run.
[189:45.96]We'll get it.
[189:46.96]We'll get it eventually.
[189:53.04]I do have to go kind of up, but I don't know.
[189:56.64]You're the master.
[189:58.94]I'm the swinger.
[190:01.73]There it is.
[190:02.49]Oh shit!
[190:03.31]Nice drop a flag there when you get a chance.
[190:13.09]Beautiful.
[190:17.13]I wasn't sure if it was going to stop or not.
[190:25.15]You hit the bottom of it.
[190:26.21]Yeah, you did.
[190:26.65]I mean, I hit the bottom of it.
[190:28.77]I'm just saying in general, you, you did that.
[190:33.01]Uh, we have to, I think we have to run left and then right.
[190:36.50]I think it's like a run left, run right.
[190:41.92]I don't think you need to.
[190:43.18]Oh, oh shit.
[190:44.36]The camera there.
[190:45.50]That's fucked up.
[190:48.28]You get that far with no checkpoints.
[190:49.78]You're like, oh, let's just, oh wait, no, you can, I'm sorry.
[190:54.57]I don't think I'm ascension human anymore.
[190:58.24]We only got like 30 meters to go.
[191:00.42]How are we doing this?
[191:01.38]What are we doing?
[191:02.86]I don't know, but we're going to do it.
[191:05.45]Doesn't make any sense.
[191:19.91]Do I, like, throw you?
[191:22.71]What do you do here?
[191:24.21]I think we need to time a second jump to get on top of that ice.
[191:27.81]Jump up on the ice?
[191:29.03]Yeah.
[191:34.44]Hold on.
[191:34.88]Okay, we're going to jump on this one, and then the other one, as soon as it gets to the top, we got to jump up.
[191:45.87]You know exactly what we're doing?
[191:47.67]Mm-hmm.
[191:52.26]There it is.
[191:52.70]Oh, shit.
[191:53.18]We got to keep... And we have to keep moving.
[191:54.90]Oh, that is going to be hell on Earth.
[191:56.85]We have to keep moving.
[191:58.53]Keep doing the next... Do the next jump.
[192:00.13]Yep.
[192:00.61]We just have to do... Just imagine you're playing this by yourself.
[192:02.77]That was a good attempt.
[192:19.93]Alright.
[192:21.12]Play the game by yourself.
[192:25.37]Oh, okay.
[192:25.97]No, I had a misunderstanding.
[192:28.19]I had a misinterpretation.
[192:29.59]We're going to go up on ice, up on ice, over to the right when it gets the right elevator.
[192:34.21]It's alright.
[192:41.85]We're good.
[192:44.49]Oh, yeah.
[192:46.51]Put a flag down.
[192:47.28]Let's go.
[192:51.06]We're going to jump.
[192:52.02]You grab the right flag.
[192:56.57]Oopsie daisy.
[192:58.76]I think you misunderstood what we're doing.
[193:00.56]I kind of did for a second, but we're good.
[193:03.54]See the block?
[193:04.16]What are you guys doing?
[193:07.20]If we get to a new zone, I'm done by the way.
[193:09.14]If we get to a new zone and there's like more, I can't, I cannot.
[193:13.30]Alright, ready?
[193:26.27]Okay, let go.
[193:28.21]There it is.
[193:33.60]Flag down.
[193:34.04]Okay, we gotta wait after the wind ends and time this Omega perfectly.
[193:42.14]I don't think we can count this down.
[193:48.89]What's with the spam?
[193:49.59]Stop spamming.
[193:50.29]What are you guys doing?
[193:51.07]Stop.
[193:52.11]Stop.
[193:54.91]Go.
[193:58.79]wait the moon oh alright on this top yep sir this one I think I gotta swing you and this might be it we did it the peak
[194:27.76]The peak.
[194:28.22]We did it.
[194:28.58]Did we actually do it?
[194:29.46]That's me!
[194:30.32]We did it.
[194:33.13]We finally did it.
[194:33.93]Give me the rock.
[194:35.83]Oh, we have.
[194:36.45]Take the rock with us.
[194:42.19]Kind of slow with the rock.
[194:44.09]We need it, though.
[194:45.81]Do I need it?
[194:46.87]It's for the achievement.
[194:47.63]How do you pick it up?
[194:54.42]I can't.
[194:55.38]It's got to be tied to you.
[194:57.25]Oh, well, what if we were leaving them?
[194:59.69]You just want to leave them?
[195:01.79]Yeah.
[195:05.95]We actually did it.
[195:07.67]That's the end.
[195:08.07]We did it.
[195:08.39]Nice job.
[195:15.30]Mail in a letter to Santa?
[195:17.18]No!
[195:18.76]Oh.
[195:28.24]I can't believe we beat it.
[195:30.26]Well, we used the check marks.
[195:35.06]Still, even with the check marks.
[195:36.98]I can't believe I stuck with it.
[195:38.64]Yeah, you stayed.
[195:41.27]Very cool.
[195:41.61]That was fun.
[195:42.47]You had fun.
[195:43.11]I did.
[195:44.37]I'm glad that we beat it.
[195:45.87]I'm glad that we pulled through and we got to experience this wondrous journey together.
[195:52.28]That was a good time.
[195:57.04]Look, that's us.
[195:57.76]That's me and that's you and I'm in the front.
[196:00.36]Yup, I'm in the back checking out your butt.
[196:08.58]That's fun.
[196:11.96]These are the people that tortured us.
[196:14.37]Yeah.
[196:19.73]Is there a post credits funny thing that we have to do or what?
[196:26.16]My hair has been like glued to my head over here this whole time.
[196:29.98]Now I know what people were talking about.
[196:31.08]Look at how long this is getting.
[196:56.60]Hillary Clinton?
[196:57.42]No, this is more Lorde.

[198:13.70]I was trying to time it with you.
[198:15.12]Yeah.
[198:16.44]That was fun.
[198:17.30]That's it, too.
[198:18.12]We've been streaming for a while.
[198:20.74]Mm-hmm.
[198:22.12]We could play that other game some other time, because it did look kind of funny.
[198:25.68]Yeah, we should.
[198:27.36]100%.
[198:28.26]We'll play the cat horror game another time.
[198:32.67]Well, buh-bye.
[198:34.71]See you later, Ster.
[198:36.41]Thanks for hanging out.
[198:37.17]Thanks for playing.
[198:37.98]Ster is always a good time.
[198:39.18]Ster is always good to have Ster around.
[198:40.36]Yeah, Ster.
[198:41.86]Say bye to Ster and follow Ster, too.
[198:44.16]Ster has his own stream where he streams Call of Duty.
[198:48.57]He streams... I don't know why.
[198:51.05]I think that's all he streams.
[198:52.25]You're a Call of Duty streamer, though.
[198:55.03]I don't play Call of Duty.
[198:56.39]He's lying.
[198:58.14]But you guys, you guys should follow Jerma.
[199:00.20]Did you know that 80% of the people watching right now aren't following?
[199:03.72]Hit that follow button.
[199:06.44]Don't.
[199:07.88]Don't.
[199:08.26]There's too many people here already.
[199:09.66]Don't.
[199:09.86]I don't want any more.
[199:12.90]No more.
[199:19.82]Talk about Diablo 4.
[199:22.86]We already did.
[199:28.24]Unfollow.
[199:29.86]He's gone.
[199:30.34]Oh, he's gone.
[199:31.18]I hate when he does that.
[199:32.00]We didn't even get an opportunity to roast him.
[199:36.39]Thanks, Blankster.
[199:37.15]Good to see you.
[199:37.93]Make sure to follow the channel.
[199:41.27]Follow Stirr's channel.
[199:41.97]Stirr's got a funny stream.
[199:43.15]Okay.
[199:48.69]So, the plan is tomorrow.
[199:50.39]Tomorrow I'm going to play some browser games and maybe, you know, maybe we'll just play Star Pang 2.
[199:57.25]Are we starting around like 3 p.m.
[199:59.47]Pacific?
[200:01.99]Gonna do a sunflower update, probably.
[200:06.97]Browser game, yeah, we'll figure it out.
[200:10.44]Tomorrow might not be a long stream.
[200:11.78]Because I gotta make sure I get everything ready to go for Tuesday.
[200:16.02]The House Flipper stream.
[200:19.49]So we'll see you tomorrow.
[200:22.25]See you around three Pacific.
[200:23.63]Thanks for hanging out.
[200:24.45]Thanks for watching as always.
[200:25.87]Good to see you.
[200:28.03]I didn't see any of you, but you know.
[200:32.52]Did read your messages though.
[200:36.28]Don't forget viewfinders on the 18th.
[200:39.19]Oh, hell yeah.
[200:48.15]The stream on Tuesday is starting at 1 o'clock Pacific, 1 p.m.
[200:52.63]Pacific.
[200:53.05]It's probably going to be about three hours, maybe three and a half hours for the whole thing.
[201:07.40]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[201:09.18]Take care of yourselves.
[201:10.49]Goodbye.
[201:12.61]Call your mother.
[201:13.89]Call your father, too.
[201:18.57]Thanks for hanging out.
[201:20.61]I still can't get over that grimace comment.
[201:22.03]That's like... Probably top five most unhinged comments I've ever heard.
[201:29.77]But, man, was it funny.
[201:39.34]Yeah.
[201:39.72]See you tomorrow.
[201:42.24]Hey, what, do you got a dent in your head?
[201:48.13]Oh man.
[201:48.75]I had a great time tonight.
[201:52.55]It was a good trip.
[201:54.15]Had a lot of fun.
[202:09.91]He doesn't want to leave.
[202:10.77]Um, no, I do.
[202:15.95]I do.
[202:17.45]Remember, I'm like a four to five hour Andy.
[202:21.75]I'm like a four to six hour Andy.
[202:22.89]It's not about wanting to leave, but, you know, we'll do it again.
[202:32.07]I'll see you whenever it's time.
[202:41.01]He has a job now.
[202:43.37]I do.
[202:44.57]That's going really well.
[202:46.15]I'm really enjoying the roll it off brand.
[202:50.65]I have been working.
[202:51.41]I have been technically going to work.
[202:55.60]I think it's great.
[202:56.08]I think I got a pretty good balance too.
[203:00.12]Like I said previously, sometimes you might not see a stream for a little bit.
[203:04.10]But I don't think it's going to be too crazy.
[203:08.82]But I like it.
[203:22.72]If you enjoy it, it's good.
[203:24.78]Yeah, I do.
[203:28.68]Still trying to get that healthy balance.
[203:36.08]Any projects to look out for?
[203:38.72]There is at least a few that
[203:42.13]I've been on.
[203:43.89]But obviously if I don't want to tell you what they are because they're in development, then you'll have to wait till they get announced.
[203:55.60]But they seem pretty awesome.
[203:57.04]Do you have a job?
[204:00.23]I do.
[204:01.09]I have a real job, mom.
[204:07.73]Spoil everything and get fired.
[204:11.41]What a terrible use of my time that would be.
[204:13.55]That would be so stupid.
[204:18.25]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[204:28.11]Take it easy.
[204:29.01]Goodbye.
[204:30.47]Take care.
[204:46.96]you
[205:21.83]Thank you.
