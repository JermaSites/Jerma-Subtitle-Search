[ve:60.16.100]

[01:09.93]Good morning.
[01:12.47]It's 9 in the morning.
[01:13.25]Go to bed.
[01:14.91]No.
[01:16.03]I've got Monster Hunter to be good at.
[01:18.25]I can't go to bed right now.
[01:22.26]EU-friendly stream.
[01:23.56]That's right.
[01:23.98]I figure I put most of you EU guys up late at night that watch the streams.
[01:33.34]Sometimes it's like 2 or 3 in the morning when I stop EU.
[01:36.92]So, it's like 4 or 5 o'clock.
[01:40.86]EU.
[01:42.51]EU stream.
[01:43.23]You know what I'm saying?
[01:49.85]It's early.
[01:50.57]It's really not that... It's like 11 o'clock.
[01:55.94]It's not that early.
[01:59.74]But give me a second.
[02:00.74]We're going to play Moon Monster Hunter.
[02:03.54]I watched some videos.
[02:04.86]I have a little bit better understanding how this game works.
[02:10.53]But I'll be right back.
[02:11.22]See you in a minute.
[03:35.43]Okay, let's turn this off switch over to here Should be good to go
[04:03.96]It's fucking freezing cold in this room.
[04:08.88]It's almost too cold.
[04:10.04]I gotta heat this up with some Monster Hunter.
[04:15.93]That's there.
[04:17.41]Hey, thank you Panda Gitz for the sub.
[04:20.85]And, uh, the Tethered Tear.
[04:23.37]Foober for two months, and, uh, Warnerv for four months.
[04:29.35]Why so early?
[04:31.01]Well...
[04:32.81]because I wasn't able to stream this weekend and late last week.
[04:40.49]So we're gonna make up for it now.
[04:41.82]Alright, so from my understanding, I did some research, I watched some beginner videos.
[04:50.84]There are only 12 items in the game, like weapons, right?
[04:55.26]You have to pick which weapon you like the best and upgrade the shit out of it, right?
[05:04.30]That's how I understand this game.
[05:06.68]At the moment.
[05:09.16]Hey, Lolinator.
[05:12.01]Thanks for the 11 months.
[05:16.43]Also, thank you, TitankNinja.
[05:20.83]Only 12?
[05:21.27]Eh, kinda.
[05:25.37]Like, you get these 12 beginner items and you just upgrade the hell out of them?
[05:29.04]Not exactly.
[05:31.64]You could say that.
[05:35.94]I also heard that I maybe probably shouldn't be using these big heavy weapons.
[05:44.36]There are 12 different types that you can either upgrade or make new ones of.
[05:47.47]Okay.
[05:50.17]I think I want to try a faster weapon.
[05:54.35]Let me try these.
[05:55.81]These are like, what, dual blades?
[05:58.35]Yeah.
[06:03.72]And, like, set decorations.
[06:05.04]Like, this is... Isn't this... Uh... It's, like, skills.
[06:11.18]You can, like, implant stuff into the items.
[06:16.24]Bloodborne has more weapons.
[06:20.43]It does.
[06:23.25]Thank you, FunkyTunk, for the five months.
[06:24.69]And iced cake.
[06:27.53]And modest cube.
[06:28.33]Thanks a lot, guys.
[06:33.23]Sword and Shield is always a good starter.
[06:35.23]Okay.
[06:37.23]I'll try these, though.
[06:37.93]Let's just see what the combos are in this.
[06:41.95]Flawless run.
[06:42.59]I also heard that these quests are really not that interesting.
[06:50.61]From the video I watched, it's, I guess, more fun to go on the boat and do the online content by yourself than it is to do these annoying, like, boring quests.
[07:06.78]How was breakfast?
[07:07.42]Actually, I had a yogurt with honey.
[07:10.64]It was pretty good.
[07:17.37]Used to be a bagpipe stream.
[07:24.23]Well, let me just test these weapons.
[07:26.88]The beginning quests are nothing.
[07:28.14]Yeah.
[07:32.30]You get the biggest monsters faster online, but yes, I believe they are harder.
[07:35.38]Okay.
[07:36.92]And I also heard that there's no way to tell which one of these is actually like an urgent quest, right?
[07:54.60]Okay.
[07:55.08]Yeah, I'm just seeing what you guys said.
[07:56.88]Where's Kim?
[07:57.46]Kim is not here.
[08:02.31]She has her own life, her own shit to do.
[08:05.75]She was over here for a few days.
[08:08.31]And now she's gone.
[08:12.54]I'm just going to do one of these.
[08:13.42]I'm just going to test one out.
[08:14.62]Let's just do Bear Trap.
[08:17.74]Capture an Arzuros.
[08:19.18]Okay.
[08:23.89]Let's do it.
[08:27.06]I also heard that, like, eating before is, like, a huge deal.
[08:29.98]Which is something that I have to get used to.
[08:33.22]Quest key quests, you don't know which ones they are.
[08:40.90]Yeah, the video I watched said that there's, like, really no way for you to tell.
[08:44.10]Oh, wait a minute, I need to... Don't I need a trap?
[08:48.84]I need to make a trap?
[08:50.14]Hold on.
[08:52.24]I'm going to, like, cancel this.
[08:55.50]How do I cancel this?
[08:56.44]Yeah.
[08:58.29]I need to make a trap, don't I?
[09:02.91]Don't accidentally kill it.
[09:04.58]Yeah, you need to buy, like, you need to do, like, two tranquilizers and a trap.
[09:09.64]I need to make it, though, I think.
[09:13.86]Let's pay for a meal.
[09:14.58]Let's just eat.
[09:16.54]Eat some scalefish.
[09:17.41]Why not?
[09:19.75]Can, like, combine ingredients here.
[09:21.15]Let's have a fish sandwich.
[09:22.75]A fried fish sandwich.
[09:33.25]Can I cure your sickness?
[09:34.25]I'm not sure I can.
[09:37.23]Health increased, stamina increased.
[09:38.57]Holy shit, that was a lot.
[09:41.99]Okay.
[09:44.29]Trap and two tranks.
[09:45.10]Yeah, that's what I read.
[09:45.82]That's what I saw.
[09:48.08]And you buy... I always buy the pickaxe.
[09:51.62]Every time.
[09:52.56]Always buy the good one.
[09:59.12]And what else do we have here?
[10:01.79]I also heard to get bug nets, too.
[10:03.17]Uh, trap tool.
[10:14.66]I need, like, a bunch of these, right?
[10:18.20]Let's just get... Let's get three.
[10:20.11]Because I might fuck it up.
[10:26.75]Just one.
[10:27.35]Yeah, we're still in the learning stages.
[10:34.64]Do I eat oranges like apples?
[10:36.04]No.
[10:39.64]Um, okay.
[10:42.99]I guess I could get more than one.
[10:44.33]Let's get like three.
[10:49.45]Can I have up to five?
[10:50.19]Okay, that's cool.
[10:53.41]I should get a couple of whetstones.
[10:54.69]Actually, those will be in the box, won't they?
[10:56.45]In these shitty quests.
[11:00.63]I have herbs.
[11:02.55]What I need to do is I need to just focus on one aspect of the game and, like, play it for a little bit.
[11:09.76]And then all this other shit.
[11:11.68]There's so much shit in this game that I have to focus on one thing.
[11:18.22]I can't do, like, everything at the same time.
[11:25.22]Alright, so I need a trap tool, right?
[11:32.70]I'm assuming that's what I have, right?
[11:33.98]Trap tool.
[11:35.63]Pitfall traps, another kind.
[11:36.73]Yeah, let's get it.
[11:42.47]So now... I need to combine items, right?
[11:49.10]Or do I?
[11:50.30]Trap tool.
[11:52.24]And... How do you make a trap?
[11:57.24]Fuck.
[11:57.94]Combo list.
[12:02.81]Shit.
[12:03.94]How do you make the trap?
[12:05.06]That's the one thing that I need to know how to do.
[12:07.00]Oh, I need a net.
[12:10.00]Okay.
[12:18.95]Old bug net.
[12:19.97]Let's just get a few of these, too.
[12:25.29]Thunderbug.
[12:26.98]Worms.
[12:27.50]These are like fishing and stuff.
[12:30.71]Need to use Google for recipes.
[12:31.89]There's a ton.
[12:33.50]Well, what's just like the standard trap?
[12:41.14]I mean, I guess I can just do that, right?
[12:43.24]Let's see what happens if I do that.
[12:48.40]Trap tool and... I don't have any thunder bugs, I don't think.
[12:55.72]Do I have anything in my... Let me look at my inventory thing.
[13:06.28]Oh, no, no, no.
[13:09.42]Do I have anything like that here?
[13:12.06]Wouldn't it just show up?
[13:13.08]I don't need to come back here every time, right?
[13:19.01]Honey.
[13:24.81]Pitfall trap.
[13:25.97]The pitfall trap is like a little mound of dirt, right?
[13:32.12]Net and bug are separate.
[13:33.10]Where do you get the net?
[13:34.36]Is that from the same lady?
[13:35.28]I didn't see one there.
[13:40.74]Is it from a different vendor or is it from the same lady?
[13:43.97]Traps and tranks will be provided, will they?
[13:45.83]Okay.
[13:51.45]Well, in that case, let me... Do I have any herbs?
[13:59.68]I don't have any herbs.
[14:01.89]How the fuck is that possible?
[14:04.87]Oh, fuck it.
[14:05.29]Whatever.
[14:05.57]Let's just do it.
[14:06.13]Okay, let's just go, go, go, go.
[14:14.70]Whatever.
[14:15.02]I already ate.
[14:19.22]No shirt face, Kim.
[14:21.18]Web and stone is net.
[14:22.42]Okay.
[14:25.12]Well, if there's one going to be in the box, then whatever.
[14:30.08]I think you man a horn for the sub.
[14:31.94]Jojo NA and Lucy X for the resub.
[14:34.36]Thank you.
[14:36.61]Finally catching up on sorcery.
[14:42.01]Capture monster alive.
[14:42.77]And you get better rewards if you... Killing versus capturing, right?
[14:47.51]If you capture, you get better shit.
[14:49.53]If you kill it, you get potentially less effective items, right?
[14:57.94]Yeah, it does limp.
[14:59.58]Once it does limp, you get in front of it, put the trap down.
[15:01.64]Mm-hmm.
[15:06.75]Then toss a tranq bomb or two at it.
[15:09.53]Gunners also can shoot tranq shots.
[15:15.78]Weakened monster.
[15:16.46]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:17.56]Okay.
[15:20.44]So the one thing that I really, really despise about playing this game on the Wii U giant brick fucking gamepad... Holding L and having to press A and Y... This might be the worst combination I have ever played in a video game to scroll through an item list.
[15:39.65]Like... Left and right on the D-pad... L and A...
[15:47.17]Like, that's... That's just fucking awful.
[15:50.67]Let's be real about that.
[15:51.67]That is fucking terrible.
[15:52.77]Oh, whatever.
[15:58.25]Whatever.
[15:58.59]I also heard that this is the most useless item in the game and never take it.
[16:10.19]Tiny hands.
[16:10.87]No, I'm like, I hate this Wii U brick.
[16:16.32]My pouch is full.
[16:17.16]Is it really?
[16:22.68]All this shit.
[16:23.64]I just don't know what to do with.
[16:24.64]Immature sponge.
[16:27.93]I didn't put this stuff away.
[16:29.93]That was a mistake.
[16:40.60]Stream 700,000 games.
[16:42.72]Told you to clean that shit out.
[16:44.82]Ah, it's just... There's so many items in this game.
[16:48.38]It's so over... This is the most overwhelmed I've ever been playing a video game.
[16:52.03]Without a doubt.
[16:53.83]But I'm going to keep playing.
[16:59.53]I'm just gonna... I'm gonna throw half of this shit in the trash.
[17:01.63]I don't even care.
[17:02.07]You know what I mean?
[17:03.95]Like, I don't even give a fuck.
[17:05.39]Just throw... I don't care.
[17:06.61]It's gone.
[17:07.59]Get rid of it.
[17:07.91]I don't even care.
[17:11.96]Like, it's just, this is too much information.
[17:14.91]Like, this shit's gotta go.
[17:18.75]Like, fucking bone.
[17:19.61]Like, whatever.
[17:20.29]I can get those somewhere else.
[17:25.71]Ugh.
[17:30.44]Like, cool drink.
[17:31.30]I don't even, like, I just get rid of it.
[17:32.82]I don't even want it.
[17:33.92]Bye.
[17:39.65]That was a secret.
[17:41.23]That was a secret.
[17:42.01]Okay.
[17:45.73]Paintball.
[17:46.73]I need that.
[17:47.31]I need... I don't care about the whetstone.
[17:52.76]This is just a dumb... Okay, easy Sonic bomb.
[18:00.06]Shock trap.
[18:05.89]Yeah, I know I'm supposed to put them in the crafting box.
[18:07.69]It's just...
[18:10.91]I just didn't do it.
[18:11.55]I forgot to do it when I started the stream.
[18:17.92]I don't give a... Again, I'm going to say I don't give a fuck about any of this shit.
[18:21.08]I don't care.
[18:24.98]I just need to move on.
[18:30.79]Bowgun.
[18:31.15]I don't need that.
[18:32.11]Easy Sonic bomb.
[18:39.40]Set up an item set.
[18:41.66]That's way over my head at the moment.
[18:51.91]Okay.
[18:52.37]Do I have blocks in here?
[18:53.73]No.
[18:53.97]Okay.
[18:54.39]Let's just go.
[18:57.49]Throw your whole pack.
[18:58.57]No regrets.
[18:59.99]Let's see.
[19:00.53]I have to put down...
[19:06.56]Do you do the, like, Sonic, like, Trank Bomb Ferdinand?
[19:09.09]You gotta... God damn it.
[19:16.27]Here's the shock trap.
[19:17.07]I need this.
[19:17.67]Okay.
[19:20.93]Get rid of this.
[19:25.02]Fuck off, game.
[19:27.92]Can't carry... I already have one of these?
[19:35.40]How do I already have one of those already?
[19:40.47]Because Trank Bomb is what I need after it's trapped.
[19:43.69]I mean, where's my trap?
[19:51.85]Sonic is pretty irrelevant.
[19:53.86]Whatever.
[19:57.92]You cannot carry any more of this item.
[19:59.30]I already have one.
[20:00.50]I don't... I do?
[20:02.12]I don't...
[20:04.36]I guess I do, but how come it's not in my list of items?
[20:06.54]Do I have to just be, like, out here?
[20:13.45]Jesus, get on with it.
[20:15.87]I'm trying to figure out how to play this game.
[20:17.71]Alright, where is this guy gonna be?
[20:23.41]That's the question.
[20:27.42]Okay, it's right there.
[20:28.26]Okay.
[20:29.54]Trap, tranq bomb.
[20:30.58]Let's try to find this guy.
[20:37.27]Let me see what the moveset is here.
[20:38.67]Okay.
[20:43.43]Interesting.
[20:49.90]So am I gonna get a cutscene when I find this thing?
[21:06.06]These things don't do very much damage, but consider moving around.
[21:11.48]The dual blades are the best weapon in the game, are they?
[21:13.10]That's cool.
[21:16.13]My framerate kind of died.
[21:17.23]I'm not sure why.
[21:21.45]Don't use the trap right away.
[21:22.45]Yeah, they have to be limping, right?
[21:34.90]The weapon sucks to go with the greatsword.
[21:42.30]We're just going to run around.
[21:45.00]Actually, I'm going to put this on the screen.
[21:46.56]Because looking down at the gamepad is just dumb.
[21:55.21]Let's do that.
[21:55.73]I think I can do customize panels right.
[21:59.77]Yeah.
[22:05.49]I'm going to put that back on the screen.
[22:06.79]I wonder if it'll just be there now.
[22:12.29]There it is.
[22:12.85]Okay.
[22:13.89]There we go.
[22:14.25]That's better.
[22:21.93]Use the bagpipe.
[22:22.75]Hammer sucks.
[22:23.39]I don't want to go in the water.
[22:29.53]I don't think this thing's in the water.
[22:36.45]Jerma, go to area 3.
[22:37.83]It's there.
[22:39.67]Well, I've... There is no discernible way for me to ever know that that was where it was supposed to be.
[22:47.81]Are you supposed to just kind of run around and explore and try to find things?
[22:50.23]Isn't that what it is?
[23:00.93]Boat, bagpipe?
[23:02.45]I would do the bagpipe if it wasn't... It just seems a little...
[23:06.90]A little too slow and a little too odd for me.
[23:15.92]Oh, here we go.
[23:22.12]Alright, so trap... Beat him up.
[23:25.44]Trap.
[23:27.22]When he's on the ground trapped, tranq bombs.
[23:30.38]Got it.
[23:36.84]Okay.
[23:37.12]Oh, he's eating honey.
[23:42.42]Okay, he's eating honey.
[23:43.22]I get it, I get it.
[23:46.22]Oh, jeez.
[23:48.80]Okay.
[23:49.64]Um... What?
[23:52.06]He heard me all the way from over there?
[23:53.28]Alright, let's do this.
[23:59.40]Let's go, bear!
[24:09.37]Let's check it.
[24:09.81]This is like just like Dark Souls.
[24:11.19]You gotta know what his move set is.
[24:20.62]Well, that didn't work.
[24:26.34]What the hell is he doing?
[24:32.51]So that's like you power it up.
[24:38.06]Boy Dodge dodge dodge wow what the fuck this guy's not hard And let me just get this ready to go Easy shock trap
[25:06.78]Oops.
[25:18.32]Dodge, dodge, dodge.
[25:24.28]Stamina management 101.
[25:29.30]Oh, okay.
[25:29.80]That's draining my... Fuck it.
[25:31.01]That's draining my stamina.
[25:32.67]Now I get it.
[25:33.69]Okay.
[25:34.29]Understand now.
[25:38.91]I get it.
[25:39.25]Alright.
[25:42.29]I didn't understand that that was happening when I power up.
[25:43.98]It drains my stamina.
[25:51.50]Come on.
[25:53.50]Get injured already.
[26:03.29]I'm waiting for him to get hurt here.
[26:11.14]Don't need to prepare the trap right away.
[26:20.66]Weapon power decreased.
[26:21.88]My sharpness is going down, but whatever.
[26:24.98]I need to actually probably use a whetstone right now.
[26:34.25]Use it.
[26:35.33]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[26:38.29]That was not quick.
[26:40.33]That was very un-quick.
[26:47.14]Shit, a bear!
[26:59.61]Do it!
[27:03.86]There we go.
[27:11.78]And honestly, I'm trying to get a hang of the dodging and the targeting.
[27:22.79]So don't mind me.
[27:30.92]Ow.
[27:33.48]Ow.
[27:38.32]Oh, okay.
[27:39.06]He's hurt.
[27:39.38]He's hurt.
[27:40.86]Right?
[27:43.87]Wasn't he just making, like, that face?
[27:45.11]Like, oh, shit.
[27:45.69]My body hurts.
[27:54.39]I'm bouncing off again.
[28:04.26]What?
[28:06.51]I wonder how much more... I'm ready to go.
[28:16.40]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[28:18.22]Hey, hold on there.
[28:19.76]Hold on there.
[28:21.18]Come here, come here, come here.
[28:22.98]Just step in that trap.
[28:26.04]Oh, God.
[28:28.23]I don't... What's he doing?
[28:29.51]What the fuck is he doing?
[28:31.37]What are you... What are you doing?
[28:33.51]What the fuck is he doing?
[28:36.30]What?
[28:36.66]What?
[28:39.10]What is going on right now?
[28:40.36]I don't... I don't, like, understand this.
[28:52.53]Come over...
[29:00.21]Gotcha, motherfucker!
[29:02.41]Alright, now paint.
[29:03.19]No.
[29:03.67]Trank.
[29:05.91]Trank bomb.
[29:06.85]Do it.
[29:17.48]Got him.
[29:28.37]Well.
[29:39.59]Fuck how?
[29:41.21]I planned that.
[29:42.37]See?
[29:42.71]I, like, knew he was gonna do that.
[29:47.41]Yeah, what are the rewards?
[29:48.41]It's pelt.
[29:53.42]Armor sphere.
[29:57.56]There's too many things.
[29:58.82]That's a lot of shit.
[30:03.07]Okay.
[30:09.45]He was not even limping.
[30:11.23]Well, wasn't he like foaming at the mouth?
[30:13.83]When they're drooling, doesn't that mean that they can be taken?
[30:24.62]Honey Hunter has been added to the gallery.
[30:31.94]Yeah, I thought that they can be trapped if they're, like, drooling, if they're exhausted, if they're... Not always?
[30:37.02]Oh, okay.
[30:38.00]He was tired, not limping.
[30:38.96]Well, I thought it was... I thought they could still be trapped if they were, like, exhausted.
[30:42.63]Okay, drooling means tired and hungry.
[30:46.19]I thought it meant that they were, like, they could be trapped, you know?
[30:48.59]Whatever.
[30:50.11]Alright, let's put some shit in my box.
[30:52.89]Somebody please shit in my box.
[31:00.90]Okay, mushroom.
[31:07.81]Beer.
[31:25.05]No, keep the bug down.
[31:25.87]Yeah, keep the bug down.
[31:26.65]Keep the bug down.
[31:28.87]Beer.
[31:31.81]Sort my items here.
[31:32.85]How do I do that?
[31:33.41]X. Where did those just go?
[31:44.09]Where did those bug nets go?
[31:55.07]I just want to keep them.
[31:59.34]Take them all.
[32:02.29]Okay.
[32:03.53]Now... Try the different weapon upgrades.
[32:09.37]Let me take a look and see what I can do.
[32:17.66]Let's see.
[32:21.18]Charms.
[32:21.78]Yeah, it's like skill points and shit.
[32:23.72]Yeah.
[32:24.22]Alright.
[32:25.68]Forge weapons.
[32:27.22]Dual blades.
[32:28.68]Bone scythes.
[32:34.30]I can make these.
[32:37.46]Jagged Shuttles.
[32:41.55]Bone.
[32:42.11]Aquasack.
[32:42.97]Spongy Hat.
[32:43.49]I can make these.
[32:44.13]No, not yet.
[32:49.71]Let me see what else.
[32:50.45]Sword and Shield.
[32:52.33]Bone Criss.
[32:56.44]Hunting Horn.
[32:57.40]Great Sword.
[32:58.02]Damn, I don't know.
[33:03.61]I already own the Bonesides.
[33:06.67]Oh, that's cool.
[33:09.93]Jawblade.
[33:17.80]Ooh.
[33:21.92]What am I using right now?
[33:24.50]Do I have Bonesides on right now?
[33:25.86]Let me just take a look.
[33:31.81]Upgrade the weapons.
[33:35.23]Should I just upgrade these?
[33:36.51]That's more important.
[33:37.39]Okay.
[33:41.85]Match to slicers.
[33:43.33]98.
[33:44.23]What happens if I upgrade them?
[33:54.42]Okay.
[33:57.28]Can't.
[33:57.60]I don't have enough.
[34:02.41]I need two more Earth crystals.
[34:04.49]I need two carpenter bugs.
[34:15.40]Hey, good morning, diabetes.
[34:19.92]Upgrading is also cheap in materials wise, so you don't need to gather kills many things.
[34:23.10]Okay.
[34:27.54]Well, I'll just stick with these for now, right?
[34:30.40]I mean, I can't really do anything.
[34:31.62]I need to keep doing shit.
[34:35.93]Just around the fields, easy.
[34:38.51]I'll go do that.
[34:38.99]Let's see, what do I need?
[34:40.91]I'll upgrade the slicers.
[34:42.93]I need two Earth crystals and two carpenter bugs.
[34:47.53]Let's just go walk around and do it.
[34:50.30]I have my pickaxe still, right?
[34:51.28]Let me make sure I still have everything.
[34:55.15]Bug nets and iron pickaxe.
[34:57.25]Okay.
[34:57.53]Let's just go, like, collect some bugs.
[35:02.14]See if I can just go get those right now.
[35:04.76]But thank you, uh, Lieutenant Goff.
[35:07.24]Lordagul the Great.
[35:08.78]Lieutenant Goff was nine months.
[35:09.88]Thanks, dude.
[35:11.34]Uh, XD, nice meme.
[35:12.38]Thanks for four months.
[35:13.40]Orthocone, 15 months.
[35:15.76]Hey, Jerma, you clown.
[35:16.56]Hope you're having a wonderful day.
[35:17.44]Well, hope you are as well.
[35:18.28]Orthocone, thank you for the 15 straight months in a row.
[35:21.97]Uh, California Critical.
[35:22.95]Thanks for the sub.
[35:23.59]Croacher for 10 months.
[35:27.46]Uh, LickDick, thanks for the sub, dude.
[35:31.74]Uh, Barmerican, thanks for the three months.
[35:36.49]ChronicWaffle, MrVatty, TheHatWearingGoose, and LucyX3.
[35:41.69]Thank you.
[35:43.47]Thank you.
[35:46.13]Just collect shit.
[35:47.13]This is a collect shit stream.
[35:58.58]How long is it going to take me to get to higher rank?
[36:00.00]Well, once I... Here's the thing about video games, guys.
[36:04.14]When you play a video game for the first five to ten hours, you learn everything about that video game.
[36:10.89]And then the next ten hours, if you're still enjoying the game, everything is clockwork and you know exactly where to go and what you're doing.
[36:17.46]I'm in that honeymoon period where I just... Hold on.
[36:20.22]What the fuck did you just say to me?
[36:26.08]I'm in that honeymoon phase.
[36:28.00]Where I'm trying to figure out everything about the game at the same time.
[36:36.06]I have bugs.
[36:36.52]Look at my bugs.
[36:38.20]Where can I find some bugs?
[36:51.38]On Iron Ore.
[36:55.32]Kelbyhorn.
[37:01.10]Earth Crystal!
[37:01.64]Look at that.
[37:02.06]Give me another one.
[37:06.71]I need one more Earth Crystal, and I need to get some bugs.
[37:14.01]Let's just keep going this way.
[37:26.09]I should probably just go in the cave, right?
[37:30.36]Whoa!
[37:32.04]Huh?
[37:33.90]Didn't I already beat you?
[37:34.72]I already beat this guy.
[37:38.06]Oh, shit.
[37:39.32]Okay, well, round two, apparently.
[37:46.09]Come here, handsome.
[37:59.58]Thank God there's no other, like, little idiots here.
[38:01.14]Look at all these wild spitters.
[38:21.06]Oh, I thought I got away from that.
[38:23.42]Damn.
[38:28.82]I should probably paintball him, right?
[38:40.23]What?
[38:42.81]Oh my god.
[38:43.63]Like seriously, these fucking controls are going to make me scream.
[38:47.77]That's the one thing I gotta get over with this game, is how much I fucking hate the control scheme.
[38:56.58]I seriously despise every second of it.
[39:04.15]It's like they tried to find the worst possible way to control this game.
[39:09.89]Just put the fucking controls all over the fucking place.
[39:12.51]That sounds like a good idea.
[39:14.91]Yeah, make the controls fucking dog shit.
[39:22.64]Do we have like a fucking 10 out of 10 video game here?
[39:25.04]Fucking ruin it with the controls.
[39:26.68]They all suck.
[39:29.28]Do it now!
[39:30.70]Boss, boss, I don't think that's such a good idea.
[39:32.68]What if they don't like it?
[39:33.48]Do it!
[39:34.56]I told you, make those controls the worst of any fucking video game ever.
[39:46.53]But I don't want... No, I'm just...
[40:02.21]No, I didn't want to put the swords away!
[40:05.43]Oh no, he's doing a Sonic blast.
[40:23.46]It's so true though.
[40:25.18]These controls are so fucking bad.
[40:27.18]This game is so cool.
[40:36.48]Top to tail.
[40:51.19]Sonic Blast.
[40:52.21]Here comes the Sonic Bloop- Sonic Boom!
[40:56.77]No!
[40:59.15]Come here.
[40:59.47]I'm not done with you.
[41:03.81]All this salt.
[41:08.51]I can, like... Wait, that's not even him.
[41:12.63]I couldn't even paintball him.
[41:13.69]There he is.
[41:16.01]Will this work if I... No, I don't think it will, will it?
[41:19.49]Let's just see what happens.
[41:20.25]I think he has to be, like, actually trapped, right?
[41:32.80]I'm just gonna kill him.
[41:33.98]I don't even care.
[41:47.80]Shit.
[41:48.32]Oh no, I have to use your whetstone.
[41:50.22]I don't have any whetstones.
[41:52.10]God damn it.
[42:00.44]I gotta hit him like right in his face.
[42:05.94]His little brother is over here now.
[42:07.18]I'm gonna hit him right in the face, I think.
[42:13.10]Is this even hurting him?
[42:16.44]He's a dry stone instead.
[42:22.76]You just sit in the drooling.
[42:32.13]Put your head down.
[42:32.67]Put your head down.
[42:33.27]Put your head down.
[42:45.59]You and me will do this all day.
[42:46.81]God fucking damn it.
[42:53.99]There, I pushed him.
[43:01.70]Right in the shoulder blade apparently works.
[43:12.52]I need to like, I don't even...
[43:18.82]I'm just gonna heal with an herb, fuck it.
[43:20.94]I'm out of stamina.
[43:58.01]Seriously.
[44:00.45]Seriously, like, what the fuck?
[44:04.74]Like, what the fuck, man?
[44:09.84]Okay, I need to know, chat.
[44:11.88]Like, am I even hurting this fucking guy?
[44:13.98]Can I even kill this guy?
[44:16.54]If I see the blood, does that even mean he can be hurt?
[44:19.91]I need to know.
[44:20.29]I need to know if I'm just wasting my entire fucking time right now.
[44:36.39]Barely and yes.
[44:42.52]Keep it up.
[44:46.62]Your sword should just leave.
[44:48.28]Well, whatever.
[44:58.44]It's so hard to line up swinging him and hitting him in the face.
[45:23.65]Come here.
[45:25.59]Come here, like fucking 45 minute boss fight.
[45:38.00]Oh, there he goes.
[45:39.66]No, I... I seriously wanna shit in the guy's pants that made these controls.
[45:47.02]Like, I wanna take... I wanna shit in his underwear.
[45:50.37]You know what I mean?
[45:50.93]And then I want to fucking, like, have him put them on, and then he's, like, embarrassed that he shit his pants.
[45:58.47]Like, he's going to be like, oh shit, when did I shit my pants?
[46:01.33]And I'll be in the corner like, yeah, yeah, haha.
[46:05.04]I, like, went into his dryer when he wasn't looking and did it, and put him on.
[46:11.14]Is there a skip button?
[46:12.26]I kind of wish there was at this point.
[46:14.14]I fucking really do.
[46:14.96]I kind of just want to run away from this.
[46:27.45]How long would this take?
[46:28.33]I don't know.
[46:35.03]I don't know how many times I have to hit this fucking guy in the face before he finally goes down.
[46:40.22]I don't have to fight it.
[46:49.22]I mean, but I'm already in too deep, right?
[46:53.99]I'm gonna die, so I'm just getting the fuck out of here.
[46:56.43]Get me the fuck out of here.
[47:00.60]I'm gonna, like, die to this piece of shit.
[47:03.68]Uh, what am I even supposed to be doing?
[47:05.26]I was like- I- I wanna just go collect shit.
[47:11.74]Just get me the fuck outta here.
[47:14.81]I'm so frustrated with this game right now, it's not even fucking funny.
[47:23.63]Wait, what?
[47:28.23]He's like, get me back to town.
[47:29.34]This is fucking stupid.
[47:48.07]Kill the raid boss.
[47:53.47]Oh, didn't I already do that?
[47:54.23]I don't know.
[48:37.09]Your weapons are broken.
[48:38.03]They break pretty damn easily.
[48:54.28]Where do I buy the healing potions?
[48:55.62]I don't even know.
[48:59.08]Just go all out and buy all of them.
[49:03.12]Can't I just make them with the herbs?
[49:06.53]Yeah, I'm just gonna... Whatever, fuck it.
[49:17.16]I need my blue mushrooms.
[49:18.64]Hold on.
[49:37.61]Buy whetstones?
[49:38.19]I have like 20.
[49:38.67]Okay, there.
[49:53.86]Success rate, 100%.
[49:54.48]Good.
[50:06.61]Oh, you can actually combine it with the box.
[50:07.67]I didn't know you could do that.
[50:09.79]Okay.
[50:10.95]So, before I, uh... was playing Wet Sock, the video game, I was trying to get another Earth crystal.
[50:20.30]Okay.
[50:26.00]No, don't discard.
[50:31.00]Whatever.
[50:31.56]I just need to get, like... I need to... God.
[50:34.28]God.
[50:39.75]Oh, my lord.
[50:49.88]It's already at maximum.
[50:50.84]Okay.
[50:52.42]So, when you go back to town, it automatically sharpens it for you?
[50:54.60]Is that what it does?
[50:55.58]I guess.
[50:58.34]I guess.
[51:04.93]All part of learning.
[51:12.11]Yeah, I guess, but I mean, I can't say I'm not fucking extremely frustrated right now.
[51:24.13]Well, I have those, and now I need to catch some bugs.
[51:33.66]What's down here?
[51:35.08]No, I don't want to go that way.
[51:37.56]I need some bugs.
[51:44.11]The thing is, like, I really like this game.
[51:50.53]This game is, like, so fucking cool.
[51:54.89]Oh, come here, bug.
[51:55.55]Bug.
[51:59.48]Spider web.
[52:05.01]But honestly, a huge deal breaker for me in video games is just sloppy shit controls.
[52:12.90]It's such a fucking deal breaker, it really is.
[52:16.90]If I can't get used to a game's control scheme that I deem to be fucking terrible, it's going to be very hard for me to want to play the game.
[52:30.61]I'm assuming there'd be bugs in here, right?
[52:39.76]What exactly did I need?
[52:48.40]I see a bug over there.
[53:06.99]The controls aren't bad.
[53:08.83]I think they are.
[53:21.04]I guess maybe that we've just been spoiled over the years with games like Dark Souls.
[53:30.01]Because the Dark Souls control scheme is nearly perfect.
[53:36.67]What the hell is that?
[53:38.79]Get off me, what the fuck?
[53:40.63]There's one of them leeches down here.
[53:44.15]Get off me, what?
[53:45.10]Oh god, roll, roll, roll, right?
[53:46.50]Okay.
[53:52.06]Like, where the fuck even am I?
[54:07.68]You understand why the controls are that way after a while?
[54:10.46]Yeah, I know, I understand, but like, that's what I mean.
[54:15.06]Games where it's like, oh no, the controls aren't bad.
[54:17.98]It just takes like 20 hours for you to figure the whole, like, to get it right.
[54:22.51]I just want a game that I know how to fucking control when I play it.
[54:25.39]I don't want to like have to spend like fucking two dozen hours.
[54:30.63]Understanding the control scheme.
[54:35.60]Control and controls and movement should not be a thing that you have to like.
[54:40.12]Be that concerned about when you're playing a video game.
[54:42.48]I think it should just be.
[54:43.48]It should just fucking work.
[54:48.22]Everything should have auto aim.
[54:50.20]And you should have infinite health.
[54:57.48]Like even like shit shit like that.
[54:58.78]That's that's another thing that I was talking about, right?
[55:05.26]Like I just want to loot this guy then like that like walk walk walk stop walk walk stop Remember when I was underwater yesterday, and it was like oh, which way are you gonna go this way?
[55:26.25]Did I get the right bug that I needed?
[55:27.84]I'm not sure.
[55:36.40]I think I figured it out.
[55:37.70]I actually think I figured out why I don't like this game's controls.
[55:41.94]If the camera stayed behind me at all times... Like, if it was... Actually, if I didn't have to use the right stick to move the camera wherever I wanted to... I can press up on the D-pad, or L, and that'll reset it, right?
[55:54.98]Okay, so if there's a monster to my right and I'm like running this way and like trying to line up swinging at him Like I have to like it's much more difficult than if I can't get the fuck out of here Get out of here.
[56:09.26]I don't want to fight this guy He heard me he heard me like you said you didn't like the controls, huh?
[56:15.80]Well, I'm back to show you why I'm laughing at you
[56:31.70]I just wanna collect some bugs!
[56:33.86]I just wanna get some bugs!
[56:46.51]I can't sharpen this right now, I gotta get rid of these little shits.
[56:49.67]I'm not gonna be able to do anything.
[56:53.75]You can run if you want to.
[56:54.61]Yeah, but that would be me being a coward.
[57:09.06]Now you're getting the hang of it.
[57:14.00]No, it's fucking cool.
[57:15.56]It's awesome.
[57:16.16]This game is fucking awesome.
[57:25.87]Alright, do I have a second?
[57:30.25]Don't come over here.
[57:35.65]Okay, hi.
[57:36.41]Now you can come over here.
[57:41.12]Let's go.
[57:48.93]Turn it off.
[58:05.29]Now here come more of his little friends.
[58:24.19]He's learning.
[58:31.24]I just... Hey, can we talk about the controls again, huh?
[58:36.20]Why don't we talk about those controls?
[58:39.68]No, I gotta stop complaining.
[58:43.96]I get it, I like, I get why, I get, I know, I get it.
[58:46.98]Do you see that backswing?!
[58:48.77]Fuck.
[59:08.64]Where did you come from?
[59:09.38]Get outta here.
[59:10.78]No, I wanna go that way, please!
[59:17.31]This camera.
[59:31.57]Monster Hunter was a mistake.
[59:42.03]Power up.
[60:03.76]Just takes a while, too.
[60:04.87]That's another thing.
[60:05.49]It just takes a long time.
[60:14.00]What?
[60:17.81]There he goes.
[60:18.31]Did he go?
[60:20.99]No, no.
[60:21.39]Put the... Put these away.
[60:23.65]Oh, God.
[60:24.41]I need some better weapons.
[60:29.82]Are these weapons just fucking awful?
[60:32.06]Is that the problem?
[60:32.78]I feel like I'm just doing the same moves over and over again to him and it's not even hurting him.
[60:39.55]I need to upgrade this weapon.
[61:07.29]Shit, he seemed like it, I mean... Don't you guys feel like he should like, he should die by now?
[61:30.16]ass right now what I I have to sharpen my sword it's a boss monster I mean yeah but dead
[62:02.94]I'm drowning.
[62:15.70]No, this is not part of the quest.
[62:16.70]But I still need to get the hang of this and figure it out.
[62:26.22]Okay, he's like dead.
[62:27.74]But no, he's going to go.
[62:28.78]He's gone.
[62:30.18]He snuck into the...
[62:35.19]Get out of the way.
[62:38.75]Did he come with this?
[62:39.49]I don't even know.
[62:40.59]I don't know.
[62:42.89]Really don't fucking know.
[62:43.79]There he is, sleeping.
[62:50.38]Okay.
[63:09.62]What an exciting battle.
[63:18.13]Will he just fucking die already?
[63:20.13]Please.
[63:21.75]Please fucking die.
[63:24.75]Please.
[63:29.45]Please die.
[63:33.98]I can't.
[63:36.98]He's gonna kill me.
[63:45.75]See, now he's angry.
[63:49.77]Now he's doing more damage.
[63:54.84]Jesus Christ, finally!
[63:56.50]Okay.
[64:16.04]This thing has so many cuts.
[64:22.90]I don't think I like these weapons.
[64:25.58]I'm going to put on one of the other swords.
[64:28.06]Because that was just a painfully long time to kill that thing.
[64:39.63]Use X and A. That's what I'm doing.
[64:52.31]Alright, um, I needed bugs, but, you know, whatever.
[64:58.39]I got some.
[64:58.91]I don't think I got the ones I need.
[65:00.27]Let me just, I want to just double check and see what I needed.
[65:03.18]I'm going to get a new weapon.
[65:20.33]Let's just take a look.
[65:25.25]The hammer, I think, was even a little bit better than that.
[65:27.08]Okay.
[65:33.06]Iron sword.
[65:33.72]Iron katana.
[65:39.80]The katana wasn't bad either.
[65:42.74]Iron lance.
[65:44.80]Gun lance.
[65:45.48]Bone axe.
[65:48.96]I already had that before.
[65:50.36]Let's try the iron sword.
[65:53.71]Let's give it a go.
[65:56.62]Kind of looks like Ludwig's Holy Blade.
[65:57.94]Let's see how good it is.
[66:05.52]Holding X. Okay.
[66:31.12]Hold R to block with the greatsword.
[66:42.77]I'm not prepared for the greatsword yet.
[66:46.77]Why not?
[66:53.69]I can do this right now.
[66:57.67]Should I just do iron sword plus?
[66:59.49]I have five iron ore.
[67:05.59]Sword and shield is the best.
[67:08.37]Kick best attack.
[67:09.79]Thank you, Purple Smart, for the two months.

[67:48.77]Yeah, I don't even know if I like it.
[67:49.81]It's true.
[67:50.33]That's probably a bad idea.
[67:53.05]Oysin08, thanks for the 500 bits.
[67:54.87]You're a good strummer.
[67:55.93]More Europe strums, please.

[68:17.00]Thank you, dude.
[68:22.10]Alright, I won't do that.
[68:23.55]Let's get back.
[68:25.71]I want to try the lance.
[68:28.81]Well, let me just go out into town and just swing at something.
[68:40.46]Oh boy, this thing is heavy.
[68:48.04]This thing is slow.
[68:50.62]This is slow.
[68:51.42]Look at me.
[68:54.36]I can barely hold this damn thing.
[69:06.21]Alright, that looks cool.
[69:08.71]Cool sword.
[69:09.97]Really interesting.
[69:17.74]That's so awesome Goodbye not using it I Don't want to use this I can already tell I'm going to hate this thing You're the Lance
[69:50.17]I'm going to actually take a minute and just try out all the weapons I haven't seen.
[69:53.87]Hunter's knife.
[69:54.51]That's like the default one.
[69:56.80]Iron hammer.
[69:57.28]I already did that.
[69:59.04]Iron lance.
[69:59.48]I already like it.
[70:05.82]I already like it.
[70:10.56]Makes me feel like a chess piece.
[70:11.72]I'm already liking it.
[70:17.44]You really just want to play Dark Souls, huh?
[70:20.68]I fucking love those games.
[70:22.36]Those games are so good.
[70:24.60]Ooh.
[70:29.50]Ooh!
[70:31.18]That, like, triple stab.
[70:34.60]I like it.
[70:34.96]Ah, yeah!
[70:48.99]Cool.
[70:49.69]Alright, what does this do?
[70:52.94]Ooh.
[70:55.58]You can't roll?
[70:56.44]I can't roll with the lance.
[70:57.38]Let me take a look at the list.
[71:06.83]While moving, draw your lance so while you're running you can do a dash.
[71:11.27]Press the X button to thrust body level.
[71:13.11]A to thrust upward.
[71:14.99]X and A to swing your lance sideways.
[71:17.72]You can also touch the special attack panel on the Wii U gamepad.
[71:20.85]Fuck the Wii U. What is it?
[71:26.55]You can also dash by pressing the X and A buttons while holding the R button.
[71:29.17]Let me just try this.
[71:36.24]Okay.
[71:37.34]That's cool.
[71:39.28]So... I'm coming to get you!
[71:47.21]That's awesome.
[71:49.76]Oh, I'm going to be such a piece of shit and miss everything, but it's going to be great.
[71:56.91]I love the weave.
[71:57.75]Do you like a shield bash?
[72:12.93]Lance is amazing.
[72:14.19]I feel like this could be pretty fun.
[72:16.68]Let me take a look at that again.
[72:17.54]Weapon guide.
[72:21.10]Finishing blow.
[72:21.78]Press the X button during a dash attack to deal a finishing blow.
[72:27.44]Press the B button to stop.
[72:29.52]You can black while holding R. Let me try that.
[72:44.97]I'm trying to test my weapon.
[72:46.11]Get out of the way.
[72:46.67]Alright.
[72:53.16]Nice.
[72:54.08]I'm going to try it.
[72:54.92]Let me see.
[72:58.61]Let me run and then press X. Nice.
[73:05.47]We're going to be Lance boy from now on.
[73:07.23]At least initially.
[73:07.99]We're going to be Lance boy until I get really mad at the game again.
[73:11.70]And decide that I'm done and I'm going to put this away and go back to something else.
[73:19.08]Alright.
[73:24.45]What was I doing?
[73:25.63]Upgrade the Lance?
[73:26.33]Upgrade the Lance?
[73:38.07]With your weapon drawn, hold the R button and hold A button to perform a counter-thrust.
[73:43.14]Like a parry?
[73:50.73]Shield attack.
[73:52.95]Back step, side step.
[74:00.54]Hold R and then hold A.
[74:09.03]Oh, fuck.
[74:09.81]Okay.
[74:16.36]Ten bucks says he quits within five minutes.
[74:20.38]Maybe.
[74:21.36]Maybe.
[74:23.48]Alright.
[74:24.00]I need to... Towner is basically a parry.
[74:28.02]Okay.

[75:06.70]Should I just say...

[75:20.07]Five iron ore and one Earth crystal?
[75:21.61]That's so easy to get.
[75:22.39]Why don't I just do it?
[75:33.10]Why not?
[75:34.34]I've done it for open so far.
[75:35.50]I'm doing it.
[75:36.50]Let's go.
[75:36.78]Let's do it.
[75:38.78]Done.
[75:43.78]Thane Lance.
[75:48.16]Ooh, look at that.
[75:50.12]Thane Lance.
[75:57.29]Nice.
[76:03.89]Okay.
[76:15.87]There's an official quest now.
[76:21.41]Okay.
[76:29.45]Strange creature in the woods.

[77:07.26]Welcome back, dude.
[77:17.05]I have potions, I have whetstones, whatever.
[77:19.09]That's my inventory.
[77:22.98]I got room for shit.
[77:26.04]Just dump it before I go.
[77:31.00]No, I have room.
[77:32.58]It doesn't matter.
[77:39.39]Gotta go to the new area to upgrade the lance again?
[77:41.09]Okay.
[77:44.89]Didn't eat...
[77:49.59]Help Cha-Cha.
[77:55.68]Just eat a ration right now.
[78:18.60]Let's go!
[78:24.10]Quick, help Cha-Cha.
[78:40.35]Okay, protect Cha-Cha.
[78:43.35]No, not too much protecting?
[78:45.69]Protect Shakalaka?
[78:48.42]Use your Shakalaka on Cha-Cha.
[78:53.58]Is that Cha-Cha?
[78:56.46]Alright, let's try the lance.
[79:06.90]Here we go!
[79:19.08]Help is on the way!
[79:19.84]I just ran through him.
[79:26.18]Alright, fucking Lance is the best.
[79:32.41]Come on!
[79:34.29]Go!
[79:35.67]Go!
[79:47.17]I like the Lance.
[79:49.22]Even though it sucks, I like it.
[79:57.82]Lancer users, rest in sleep.
[80:04.10]Did I win?
[80:04.52]Huh?
[80:15.07]Oh, what the fuck?
[80:16.11]What are you doing over there, man?
[80:23.03]Boring, but effective.
[80:34.22]He'll be fine on his own for a minute.
[80:43.08]Alright, I gotta go help Cha-Cha.
[80:53.21]I'm pretty sure you'd like anything else rather than your old weapon.
[80:58.05]I was not happy.
[80:59.33]You're right.
[81:03.99]Can't I... Hold on a second.
[81:11.08]No.
[81:11.74]Something, something, control scheme.
[81:16.08]Do I run faster like this or no?
[81:19.58]I'm not sure.
[81:24.27]Now get behind me.
[81:34.87]No, come here.
[81:35.47]Oh, they're going to eat him alive.
[81:37.47]Come here.
[81:37.97]Did I get a triple?
[81:44.94]Oh, no.
[81:45.54]Almost.
[81:53.29]This is so... It's so dull.
[82:01.68]Whoa!
[82:02.00]What am I doing?
[82:02.70]Swap?
[82:03.18]What?
[82:03.70]No.
[82:04.08]Okay.
[82:04.20]I don't have enough room.
[82:14.60]Just stone, whatever.
[82:25.08]Collateral.
[82:25.74]Okay, I'm close enough.
[82:41.31]Please, God, leave shit in your room.
[82:42.77]Oh, well.
[83:01.89]Turn the camera, please.
[83:05.31]Nice hit.
[83:08.83]Good job, Shakalaka.
[83:11.09]You did great.
[83:13.24]EDF.
[83:21.94]Why are you guys chanting EDF?
[83:32.11]I'm starting to get those pains in my stomach where, like, I'm moving way too slowly.
[83:42.94]And my hand is actually starting to hurt because I'm holding this controller in my hands.
[83:51.76]Ah, my pouch is full.
[83:53.22]I just... whatever.
[83:54.92]Discarded.
[83:55.70]I don't care.
[84:07.95]Huh?
[84:09.87]Hey, I did it.
[84:15.74]When Nintendo decided to make the Wii U gamepad, like, and actually put it on their console, were they unaware that people don't like to hold iPads for more than, like, an hour in their hands?
[84:32.31]This is just the hurt-your-hands control.
[84:48.35]Get a pro controller.
[84:49.23]Yeah, that's the thing though.
[84:52.35]Why do we as consumers have to spend like 60 fucking dollars to use a usable device for the system?
[85:06.50]Like, what?
[85:15.79]Oh, my hands are too tiny.
[85:17.09]No, it's just uncomfortable.
[85:26.70]It should fucking come with a pro controller in the box.
[85:40.64]So that was an urgent quest, which means... What does it mean exactly?
[85:53.74]New hunting ground.
[85:54.86]Flooded forest.
[86:02.55]The Kurupeko on the sandy plains.
[86:05.17]Kurupeko.
[86:12.21]Kurupeko, huh?
[86:16.22]Slay seven, no pest control.
[86:18.29]Slay twelve.
[86:20.15]Hunt a great warg.
[86:21.37]Warggy.
[86:23.21]Four eggs, rampage.
[86:24.99]Where is it?
[86:26.51]Hunt a kurupeko.
[86:31.57]Sure.
[86:32.29]Let's do it.
[86:32.59]It's a big, annoying bird.
[86:50.06]Sandy plains.
[86:51.28]Okay.
[86:54.72]Fire?
[86:55.10]Whatever.
[87:00.51]Not yet.
[87:00.81]I'm going to put some stuff away.
[87:12.70]Item box.
[87:13.62]Alright.
[87:14.34]Store the... Well, I'm going to cook up all this raw meat.
[87:18.13]Whetstone.
[87:18.79]Felvine.
[87:20.53]Store.
[87:22.57]Iron ore.
[87:23.17]I think I asked this already, but is there a way for me just to kind of bang, bang, bang, bang, bang?
[87:34.18]Like throw all this shit in here?
[87:35.66]Although I happen to do it one by one.
[87:48.80]Gunner's pouch.
[87:51.37]There's X, sort of.
[87:52.35]Okay.
[87:57.53]Why no face cam?
[87:58.29]I don't know.
[87:59.25]I'm just chilling.
[88:11.18]So, this guy, this is like a companion now.
[88:13.07]I can bring him with me.
[88:27.85]Alright, get to the point, kid.
[88:36.83]Invite on quest.
[88:37.75]Should I just bring him with me?
[88:39.61]Let's bring him with me.
[88:41.65]Select dances.
[88:42.67]Taunt.
[88:43.23]Health recovery.
[88:43.95]Attack.
[88:46.41]Acorn mask.
[88:49.97]Fire attack.
[88:50.73]Water attack.
[88:55.44]Ice attack, thunder, water attack?
[88:57.44]Let's go with water attack, why not?
[89:01.92]Put it on, right?
[89:11.09]Use him as bait.
[89:13.59]Alright, yeah, come with me.
[89:17.81]Come on the quest, Cha-Cha.
[89:18.93]He's at my side.
[89:20.85]Now I have a little party member.
[89:22.07]Let's do it.
[89:22.49]Let's go fight this bird.
[89:29.59]Playing with fire.
[89:30.37]Let me eat something first.
[89:40.65]Alright, we're going to go with thorny meat.
[89:44.86]And... Mossy cheese.
[89:48.90]Steam it.
[89:51.58]Yeah, steam it.
[89:54.26]Use cash.
[90:03.18]Stamina increased.
[90:03.96]Attack increased.
[90:05.40]High activated.
[90:11.52]Whatever that means.
[90:12.52]Let's go.
[90:12.90]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[90:16.93]Paintballs.
[90:17.29]I don't want a paintball.
[90:28.56]Paintball, paintball, paintball.
[90:33.49]Paint S. Paint Coating.
[90:41.35]Can I not buy paint balls from her?
[90:43.53]Do I have to like make them?
[90:47.32]Hmm.
[90:59.46]Paint S.
[91:02.69]Guess I have to make them.
[91:03.51]How do you make them?
[91:11.33]No, they'll just be there.
[91:12.16]Whatever, let's just go.
[91:20.28]Let's go, buddy!

[92:17.60]Okay.
[92:20.98]Poison coating.
[92:21.76]I'm just going to take these.
[92:25.77]Okay, let's do it.
[92:32.67]Let's get Max.
[92:33.65]Why not?
[92:37.49]There's that.
[92:40.62]Uh, potion.
[92:41.34]Alright, let's go.
[92:41.82]Let's track the monster.
[92:46.30]Wherever he may be.
[92:54.79]He's not here.
[93:05.63]Dung bomb makes a monster leave.
[93:06.97]Okay.
[93:15.55]Cool drink.
[93:16.58]Should I take the cool drink now?
[93:17.66]Oh, so when you go to the desert.
[93:31.30]Okay.
[93:33.56]Let's just go 1, 2, 3, 4, right?
[93:42.20]We're gonna go through the whole alphabet, guys.
[93:54.83]Fuck.
[93:55.47]No!
[93:55.77]He took the fucking paintball.
[93:56.81]Give me that paintball back, you piece of crap.
[94:06.70]Alright, whatever.
[94:08.04]One, two, three.
[94:13.35]Can't see anything.
[94:24.19]Nothing here.
[94:24.93]In number three.
[94:27.07]That's why we're going to go to four.
[94:28.95]But first, let's take this pineapple.
[94:39.37]What mission am I doing?
[94:40.09]I'm doing the Ako... The Abde Ako... Piko, whatever it is.
[94:44.79]It's on boss.
[94:45.43]A lot of cactus flowers.
[94:55.30]Okay.
[94:58.80]On to four.
[95:07.34]I gotta get the paintball ready, because I will screw that up.
[95:14.72]Nothing for... But there are some triceratopses.
[95:20.97]Oh shit.
[95:21.21]Does this block?
[95:28.13]It does.
[95:28.59]Okay.
[95:29.85]Defense boost.
[95:30.99]Thanks a lot.
[95:38.73]Dead?
[95:40.83]Not dead?
[95:41.57]What?
[95:44.64]Okay.
[95:46.74]I guess he was dead.
[95:50.04]Let's go to five.
[96:04.15]Wait, what's this?
[96:04.69]Can I do something with this?
[96:06.47]No.
[96:12.39]What am I doing on Kim's stream channel?
[96:16.93]I think I was going to keep moving.
[96:21.11]I just want to find it.
[96:25.09]Let's go to six.
[96:28.99]Here, on the way to seven.
[96:37.01]Wait, hold on.
[96:42.63]Nothing.
[96:43.93]Stop fighting monsters.
[96:44.93]We have to find this dumb bird.
[96:53.21]Over to eight.
[96:55.74]Not very many places he can be.
[96:57.36]Oh, this is ten.
[96:59.14]Let's go up to eight.
[97:04.10]I believe this looks like the desert.
[97:05.70]I have to take that cool drink.
[97:10.61]Okay.
[97:10.97]Uh-oh.
[97:31.86]This looks like a fruit juice mascot.
[97:37.30]You know what I mean?
[97:37.86]Can't you see that thing on the cover of like Juicy Juice for like a grape, apple, berry?
[97:42.16]Hold on, I gotta drink this.
[97:47.47]Where is he?
[97:49.23]Isn't that one of these giant guys?
[97:50.59]Where did he just go?
[97:59.93]Alright, let's do that in A, right?
[98:08.60]Okay, I'm not... I'm just going.
[98:23.49]I'm not gonna fight this thing.
[98:26.43]Let's just keep going.
[98:27.75]Why fight this?
[98:28.69]I need to fight the bird.
[98:33.16]No, he's not this way.
[98:34.14]Where the fuck did he go?
[98:35.06]Is he just flying around here?
[98:44.54]Shit.
[98:57.59]Let's just go down again.
[99:00.62]I could go to 11.
[99:01.28]I'm gonna go to 11.
[99:03.24]Just go backwards to 7.
[99:04.06]He's somewhere between 1 and 11.
[99:14.28]That is true.
[99:33.00]On to seven.
[99:37.24]Will Monster Hunter be on the switch?
[99:40.23]Probably.
[99:40.89]Isn't there a Monster Hunter 4 ultimate right now?
[99:48.37]Down maybe?
[99:49.58]Wait, hold on.
[99:52.74]What was that?
[99:54.00]I just saw a thing I could collect, right?
[99:58.90]No, you don't take it.
[99:59.78]That's mine.
[100:15.57]3DS only.
[100:16.11]But wasn't this 3DS?
[100:17.39]And they kind of ported it to Wii U.
[100:28.29]He gathers things for you sometimes.
[100:29.49]That's cool.
[100:35.61]Oh, there he is.
[100:37.63]There he is.
[100:38.03]Hold on.
[100:38.33]Can I sneak up on him?
[100:42.05]No, you can't.
[100:46.87]Come here, you son of a gun!
[100:56.02]What is he doing?
[100:56.52]What is he doing?
[100:57.16]I'm stuck in his body.
[101:03.24]I was stuck inside of his fucking stupid ass body.
[101:08.56]Shit.
[101:12.40]Alright, ChaCha, be annoying.
[101:13.52]Alright, paintball.
[101:20.25]Fuck your menu game, seriously.
[101:21.81]I hate it so much.
[101:31.07]Did I get it?
[101:32.09]Did I hit it?
[101:33.01]I'm not sure.
[101:33.99]He went in the air.
[101:34.67]I think I got it.
[101:37.97]I'm pretty sure.
[101:38.47]I'm going to animation cancel this shit.
[102:00.29]What the hell am I doing?
[102:05.15]Shit, I thought he was going to dive in.
[102:11.13]Fuck, I should have blocked it.
[102:22.62]Oof, this is...
[102:26.47]I guess I just need to keep walking?
[102:27.79]I don't know.
[102:29.37]This is so... This is un-fucking-bearably slow.
[102:34.03]I need to put this shit away and, like, get the fuck out of here.
[102:39.57]I can't even fucking move.
[102:41.77]Cha-Cha, can you fucking do something?
[102:43.45]Instead of, like, burying your ass in the ground?
[102:44.89]That would be fucking great.
[102:54.70]You can't roll with the lance.
[102:57.36]You cannot do it.
[103:01.31]Let's just get the full health.
[103:18.60]That didn't hit him?
[103:19.92]What?
[103:20.10]How the fuck did that not hit him?
[103:37.69]Dash, dash, dash.
[103:43.93]I do like the fact that I can go up, though.
[103:45.58]That's very helpful.
[103:51.37]Random fucking bug.
[103:53.59]Got a random bug up my ass.
[104:01.36]Shit.
[104:06.94]Stay locked onto him.
[104:07.90]Block it.
[104:08.44]Whatever he's gonna do, charge him.
[104:16.02]Seriously.
[104:17.98]Seriously.
[104:20.33]Honest to fucking God.
[104:24.03]Can you pl- I- you know?
[104:25.13]I'm getting real sick of this shit.
[104:28.41]I really am.
[104:32.71]I need to roll.
[104:33.41]No, you need to fucking roll.
[104:34.81]Please!
[104:35.75]Do the thing that I fucking press!
[104:37.75]For the love of God!
[104:38.75]Aye, aye, fucking yai!
[104:44.01]This is un-fucking-bearable!
[105:02.46]Where is he?
[105:03.30]Is he just flying around?
[105:04.36]Okay, he's going to four.
[105:08.16]Oh, shit.
[105:34.67]Now here comes his little buddies.
[105:40.01]I have to get rid of these fucking things, they'll be such a pain in the ass.
[105:48.53]I'm on fire now.
[105:49.49]Hold on, let me slowly put my fucking lance away so I can roll once.
[105:55.41]And that's just it, now great!
[105:57.03]Now there's a fucking Jago!
[105:58.69]Now there's a fucking Jocko!
[106:04.60]Fuck.
[106:06.46]Make sure you flex after you drink a potion.
[106:08.69]Oh my god.
[106:10.11]Fuck this.
[106:11.89]Fucking god.
[106:19.04]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[106:20.08]I have to run.
[106:22.68]I have to run.
[106:23.12]Or I have to play this game with like fucking seven people.
[106:32.69]Yeah, this ain't gonna happen.
[106:34.93]This ain't gonna happen.
[106:35.63]Look at this.
[106:37.07]Am I playing a fucking MMO or am I playing a game by myself?
[106:51.51]How do you sidestep?
[106:52.53]Because I'm trying to hold left and sidestep and I'm just going backwards.
[106:57.25]It doesn't make any fucking sense to me.
[107:05.92]I ran into one of these little dickheads.
[107:28.82]Hey, welcome to Monster Hunter, aka Irritating Dark Souls.
[107:37.72]With big monsters.
[107:38.76]That ain't gonna work.
[107:54.54]No, let me spin around.
[108:08.76]Run I have anything I can do here.
[108:15.12]I don't need to drink No, it's like nothing I can do
[108:36.50]Come on.
[108:39.04]God!
[108:43.49]I need to fucking... That is getting so annoying!
[108:47.93]Why does my character turn his back and dodge forward?
[108:58.90]I'm not even gonna have an opportunity to do this.
[109:05.78]This is the only shot I got.
[109:06.78]Come on, please.
[109:07.72]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[109:15.72]No, I've... What a love of all that is fucking sacred.
[109:22.46]Fuck this game.
[109:30.37]Seriously, fuck this game.
[109:40.09]Fuck this Lance.
[109:41.79]And fuck this game.
[110:08.27]This is harder than Dark Souls.
[110:09.41]This is harder than any of the Dark Souls.
[110:11.25]I've played them all.
[110:23.42]It's not even hard, it's just fucking irritating.
[110:30.70]It's just a fucking irritating game.
[110:33.30]Dark Souls is hard.
[110:34.36]This game is fucking irritating.
[110:44.59]It's like somebody took the Dark Souls 3 disk, took it out of the fucking tray, and like scratched it on the corner of a table and put it back in.
[110:54.98]That's the difference.
[111:03.88]Where's the... Let me try... What is this one?
[111:12.95]What can I do with this?
[111:33.12]Mmm, I can do Hunter's Knife Plus.
[111:55.53]BabyRage.
[111:56.93]I mean, I'm just, like, I'm just, like, taking the piss for a lot of it.
[112:19.53]I have plenty of these materials.
[112:28.84]Bonecris or... Should I make the Bonecris?
[112:38.07]Grind Jaggi and get the Jaggi equipment.
[112:46.71]No, I'm not giving up yet.
[112:52.70]I'm not giving up.
[112:53.90]I'm just fucking extremely irritated.
[113:03.58]Get rid of the lancet shit.
[113:06.52]I don't think it sucks.
[113:07.53]I mean, I just said it sucks, but you know, whatever.
[113:09.91]Should I upgrade it?
[113:14.33]I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing.
[113:17.25]This is the game of no idea what the fuck you're doing.
[113:19.51]This is how it works.
[113:25.39]I'll just do this.
[113:26.37]I have so much iron ore.
[113:27.74]This just takes nothing.
[113:30.04]Just do it.
[113:30.66]Whatever.
[113:44.17]So is there a chance that you get a better version?
[113:46.47]Right?
[113:47.21]I'm gonna assume.
[113:57.77]Is that how that works?
[113:58.51]Like, you craft something and there's a chance it can be, like, a rare or something?
[114:02.73]Yeah, I know I just made another one.
[114:03.91]I was, like, seeing what it did.
[114:04.97]I have no idea what it does.
[114:21.70]Um...
[114:27.67]Oh, there are no rares.
[114:28.49]It's the same.
[114:29.19]Okay.
[114:31.19]What's the point of ever making one of these items, then?
[114:39.49]If you... Alright, hold on.
[114:41.21]If you get every single one of these items in the beginning of the game, why would you ever have an opportunity to... Why would you ever make one?
[114:50.62]Why does this category exist?
[114:53.84]I don't get it.
[114:57.21]Let's upgrade it.
[114:58.63]No, we'll just do the hunter's knife plus.
[115:03.49]Mid damage is a little higher, really?
[115:09.58]98, no.
[115:09.96]This one has different sharpness.
[115:12.96]No, it doesn't.
[115:17.90]Whatever.
[115:18.22]Let's try this one.
[115:33.10]Let's do armor craft, too.
[115:33.86]I just want to take a look at it.
[115:47.95]Should I just level up all my chainmail stuff?
[115:50.00]I mean, I have nine armor spheres.
[115:52.04]I feel like that wouldn't be... I don't know.
[116:05.57]It's all about different paths.
[116:06.69]Okay.
[116:16.62]Jaggy male.
[116:17.66]Jaggy vest.
[116:18.44]Okay.
[116:23.70]Jaggy male, jaggy vest.
[116:26.68]Alright.
[116:27.12]We gotta kill... I have to kill giant jaggies then, apparently.
[116:36.14]Let's go do that.
[116:38.73]Let me eat something.
[116:40.55]And get some potions.
[116:41.31]I don't think I have any more blue mushrooms, though.
[116:53.43]Do I already have 14 of these?
[116:54.33]Yeah, I do.
[116:57.41]Blue mushrooms.
[116:58.17]I need blue mushrooms.
[117:09.63]Didn't I plant mushrooms down here on the farm?
[117:24.79]Done, right?
[117:25.39]Yeah.
[117:28.91]Crop box, there we go.
[117:35.59]Out of room.
[117:37.23]Into the box.
[117:41.81]I don't sell those.
[117:42.71]I don't want them.
[117:53.72]Source.
[117:56.74]Toadstool?
[117:58.38]Whatever.
[117:58.72]I'm not sure what that does.
[118:10.97]Alright, let's just go.
[118:11.55]I actually have enough potions where I can just go kill some shit.
[118:23.70]I don't think I even need to eat anything.
[118:25.10]I have wet stones.
[118:26.00]I have some potions.
[118:30.02]Yeah, screw it.
[118:31.10]Let's just... I can kill one of those dumb things.
[118:36.60]I'm loving this.
[118:37.46]I love new players.
[118:40.45]Why, does everybody that plays this game for the first time like talk about how they fucking hate themselves and hate the game?
[118:46.39]Alright, big jaggy.
[119:04.88]There's one.
[119:07.56]Actually, what are the moves?
[119:08.66]I need to see this move.
[119:09.82]Wait, wait, wait, where's it going?
[119:10.88]I don't know, I didn't even look at the moveset.
[119:14.75]Whoops.
[119:27.87]Watch out!
[119:28.71]Watch out for the fucking... ...Paleosaurus.
[119:31.71]I don't know what this thing is.
[119:40.74]What is going on with my camera?
[120:14.90]What does this do?
[120:15.40]What does the charge do?
[120:16.42]Oh, it doesn't do anything.
[120:20.19]Okay.
[120:31.91]I guess the main problem I have is the fact that I think this is the only game I may have ever played that's a third-person game like this that doesn't have target lock.
[120:40.82]And when you swing, and I'm trying to swing in a certain direction, it's just wherever you're front-facing.
[120:48.92]I have to unlearn everything I've ever played.
[120:54.53]I just expect when I press L, it's like, oh, he's locked on.
[120:58.03]I can dodge around him, and nope.
[121:00.90]You have to be facing the perfect direction.
[121:06.40]Is it two of them?
[121:07.16]There's two of them here now.
[121:08.06]Okay.
[121:08.94]What the fuck?
[121:11.86]It's like almost like they... I'm telling you, they hear me.
[121:15.72]The devs hear me.
[121:18.66]We've played too many Dark Souls games.
[121:20.08]Those are like some of my favorite games ever made.
[121:22.51]So, it's gonna be almost impossible to unlearn it.
[121:25.69]And where the fuck are you going?
[122:11.68]Do it, quick!
[122:14.82]Oh, not quick enough.
[122:21.50]Still fighting this thing?
[122:22.44]No, this is like the fourth one I've fought.
[122:24.74]You have to grind these apparently.
[122:27.10]From what I understand.
[122:40.16]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[122:41.70]What is that?
[122:45.63]What just... No!
[122:52.18]He's not gonna... Don't...
[123:08.41]Now can you please come over here so I don't do that again?
[123:12.78]Can you get away from like the area where I'm gonna zone into the next place?
[123:16.46]I would appreciate it.
[123:21.85]I'm just like the A attack with this thing.
[123:30.81]No shit, here comes his like best friend.
[123:47.28]He's gonna go to sleep over here, isn't he?
[123:52.50]No!
[123:55.50]God, did... God... Did... Who ever thought it was a good idea to make them do an emote after they drink a fucking potion?
[124:06.04]Who thinks that's fucking something that should be in a game like this?
[124:09.43]I... I... I... I... I...
[124:18.41]I I Just know I don't have you know, I don't even say me to say it you guys know I don't need to say it No, I'm gonna do it again
[124:46.88]He's gonna transform.
[124:48.30]Here we go.
[125:06.89]What is ChaCha doing there?
[125:18.04]Let's take another whetstone Asshole
[125:49.85]He's gonna be sleeping right here.

[128:54.63]I fucking hate this.
[128:56.09]Why do I like this?
[128:57.57]It's taking over my body.

[131:11.91]I really need to desperately do this, though.
[131:17.78]He might be a little too angry for me to do it.
[131:20.84]Oh, he's hurt.
[131:24.55]Okay, let's do it now.
[131:38.30]Dry skin these fucking people.
[131:43.26]I don't have time for this shit.
[131:44.48]He's gonna heal.

[131:52.05]Please.
[131:54.73]Please.
[131:56.34]Okay.
[131:56.62]Before I lose my fucking mind.
[132:03.64]Where did he go?
[132:04.46]Over here?
[132:04.82]In here?
[132:09.52]I hope.
[132:14.01]Where did he go?
[132:14.59]I thought he went in this cave.
[132:29.18]That's it?
[132:29.62]He's depleted already?
[132:42.52]I don't know where he went.
[132:43.64]I guess that's what happens when you don't have any... Any shit to do, right?
[133:02.97]Seeing HPS for the week.
[133:16.17]Not here.
[133:19.79]This is the only other cave.
[133:25.99]Where the hell did he go?
[133:31.04]Shit!
[133:42.74]Well, he's gonna have health when I get back to him apparently.
[133:53.58]Six?
[133:53.92]There he is.
[133:59.03]Alright, I got full.
[134:01.47]Let's get him.
[134:15.42]Die!
[134:15.86]Then I can finally make something.
[134:17.36]Oh, my fucking hand hurts.
[134:19.94]Ow.
[134:20.74]Ow.
[134:35.17]Get out of here.
[134:36.63]You're just the obnoxious little shithead that I don't want to deal with right now.
[134:40.01]Dead.
[134:41.49]Okay, fuck off.
[135:01.43]Go do your best and distract that guy.
[135:04.43]Nice distraction.
[135:06.21]Oh, thank god.
[135:14.07]Throw your boomerang at him.
[135:15.13]Do something.
[135:15.63]Get him away from me.
[135:20.88]What's that?
[135:34.92]These guys give me shit like that, too.
[135:36.90]Probably.
[135:41.62]Yeah, I know I gotta get quests for it.
[135:42.96]I just wanted to come out and do it.
[135:44.54]Because, like, now I can do one of them.
[135:53.48]That's it, huh?
[135:54.02]Okay, let's just go back.
[136:01.05]Now do that ten more times.
[136:05.54]Just do that 10 to 20 more fucking times.
[136:18.81]Jaggy vest or jaggy mail?
[136:20.72]I mean... Jaggy mail just seems to have more defense.
[136:37.90]Use the greatswords.
[136:41.60]Okay, it's on.
[136:52.00]King's frill.
[136:56.50]Head.
[136:58.58]Helm.
[137:00.02]I need another claw and three iron ore.
[137:02.00]That should be easy enough.
[137:09.98]Can I upgrade this already?
[137:13.36]I can.
[137:13.66]Should I level it up?
[137:16.90]Use an armor spear and just put it up to level 2?
[137:25.37]Thank you, Solair, for the four months.
[137:27.23]Also, hihohee for 11 months.
[137:30.93]Welcome back, guys.
[137:36.60]Everybody, why not, right?
[137:42.57]Do it again?
[137:42.97]I could do it a couple of times, right?
[137:54.34]Sure, you earned it.
[138:01.00]Now, what would be considered a dumb idea?
[138:03.97]Doing this more than a couple of times?
[138:18.15]I'll do it one more time.
[138:23.23]Okay.
[138:33.38]This is like a whole other can of worms.
[138:42.37]I'll do it like two more times.
[138:48.67]No, I don't have the materials.
[138:54.33]Okay.
[138:56.90]I need another pickaxe, I think.
[139:06.42]I'm gonna eat something and get another pickaxe.
[139:28.10]Binoculars.
[139:32.86]Okay.
[139:41.86]Don't have negative fire resistance against the birds.
[139:44.21]Yeah, I just realized that.
[139:59.37]Oh, what?
[139:59.98]It failed twice?
[140:00.92]I got two fails in a row at 95%.
[140:06.86]Are you fucking kidding me?
[140:09.94]Okay.
[140:36.36]Mega potion.
[140:48.11]Alright, now... XCOM, is that you?
[140:52.00]Alright, let's store some stuff.
[141:05.93]I think that's good.
[141:24.23]No, I don't want any of this.
[141:25.13]Alright.
[141:28.97]I guess I can do that again, right?
[141:39.47]Now I can make a couple more mega potions.
[142:01.48]Let's stay with ten.
[142:02.14]That's good.
[142:03.40]Alright.
[142:07.17]Cooked meat is handy.
[142:09.22]I'll bring it back then.
[142:14.68]You just said cooked meat and my stomach just growled.
[142:25.15]Use the sort button in your item chest?
[142:26.57]I just did.
[142:32.65]I did that already.
[142:36.00]It's X. I mean, I did it already, didn't I?
[142:44.84]Alright, let's get a jaggy quest.
[142:49.93]And do this again.
[142:56.53]No, no.
[142:59.86]Alvestor.
[143:01.84]Sandy Plains.
[143:05.22]I can't answer that right now.
[143:07.60]Bug hunt.
[143:09.22]Hunt an Azeroth.
[143:11.70]Who's the boss?
[143:12.63]Capture a great jaggy.
[143:16.14]Oh, boy.
[143:16.48]That's going to be a pain in the ass.
[143:17.44]Okay.
[143:19.92]No, that's no glory.
[143:20.80]Let's just see what the other one is.
[143:27.82]Nope.
[143:29.05]Nope.
[143:29.81]Nope.
[143:30.75]Nope.
[143:32.81]That's the only one I have, so I guess we're going to have to do it.
[143:37.01]Capture it.
[143:37.41]Great, Jaggy.
[143:45.10]I need some traps.
[143:47.53]Well, they'll be in the thing, right?
[143:50.87]I think they'll be in the thing.
[144:01.45]Late as usual.
[144:02.17]Let me see.
[144:08.56]Item pouch.
[144:13.06]Yeah, it'll be in little blocks, right?
[144:18.35]He's going to kill it, isn't he?
[144:23.49]Why suffer through Monster Hunter 3 when Monster Hunter 4 is so much better?
[144:27.33]Because Monster Hunter 4 is not on the Wii U. And I don't have a way to capture the DS.
[144:39.98]Now let's go with some rice and Rapscallion.
[144:46.97]Sure.
[144:47.71]Health +2.
[144:48.29]Let's go.
[144:48.85]Hit it.
[145:00.37]Alright.
[145:05.27]So, the way the traps work in this game... I want to make sure I get this perfectly clear.
[145:14.51]When I make him so he's limping, I have to then sprint in front of him, the direct line that he's walking on, and go really far ahead of him, and put the trap down, right?
[145:39.03]Only one tranq bomb.
[145:48.48]Wait till he's asleep.
[145:50.20]Or sneak up on him when he's sleeping.
[145:54.28]So wait, when he's asleep, sneak up and put it on top of him when he's asleep?
[146:00.97]Or should I put it slightly in front of him?
[146:07.23]I need two.
[146:07.83]How come there wasn't two in here?
[146:09.23]Shit.
[146:17.03]I have three.
[146:18.18]I'm fine.
[146:18.46]Alright.
[146:22.30]Raw meat.
[146:22.90]Barbecue spit.
[146:23.88]Let's just do this.
[146:27.06]Just directly on top of him?
[146:28.28]Okay.
[146:37.97]I tried to take it off and it didn't work.
[146:48.83]Rare steak.
[146:55.07]I'll take the ration too.
[146:56.03]It's gonna eat it alright now.
[146:59.99]Let's just fucking eat.
[147:04.94]Let's eat!
[147:14.76]Does this do HP or is this stamina?
[147:20.49]I don't know.
[147:21.91]I don't think anything.
[147:25.03]Alright, so we got... We need... Sit in there and run.
[147:38.00]Easy shock trap.
[147:39.40]And then two tranq bombs.
[147:42.15]And that should be it.
[147:42.89]Let's go.
[147:51.15]Usually they're hanging out, like, over here somewhere.
[147:55.05]Oh, meat is always down.
[147:55.99]Okay.
[147:59.52]Okay.
[148:08.56]Giant Jaggy, where are you?
[148:10.12]I see some Jaggies over there.
[148:22.54]No giant ones, though.
[148:33.66]You can throw one at him before you tranq him.
[148:35.95]Before you trap him.
[148:36.87]Okay.
[148:52.43]No?
[148:54.25]No?
[148:54.73]What?
[148:55.07]Really?
[149:04.70]Big one?
[149:05.08]Big one?
[149:05.38]Any big guys?
[149:20.03]Thanks, Cha-Cha.
[149:31.57]I don't see anybody.
[149:42.08]Focus the tail.
[149:45.52]Yeah, all the enemies have weak points, right?
[149:54.87]Been a blast.
[149:55.41]Well, thank you devil.
[149:58.97]Don't let people distract you from your goal of kill monsters.
[150:02.71]Get good, kill bigger monsters.
[150:08.10]Where the fuck is this guy?
[150:16.62]Should I go down to four?
[150:17.56]I'll try four.
[150:25.64]Come on, great jag-eye, where are you?
[150:31.00]The thrill of the hunt.
[150:37.62]Am I using 3DS?
[150:38.40]No, I'm using the Wii U gamepad.
[150:42.68]Thank you, BingleJilly, for the five months.
[150:47.07]Also, thank you to Devil for the sub as well.
[150:49.31]He subbed too.
[150:55.67]That was good ore.
[151:03.23]Can't tell if I'm hitting him.
[151:15.64]These are those enemies in Binding of Isaac.
[151:19.48]Those little slugs.
[151:20.24]They make the same noise, too.
[151:22.90]That's kind of terrifying.
[151:27.77]Okay.
[151:34.18]Oh.
[151:35.23]Malalite.
[151:37.93]Millerlite.
[151:43.43]Uh... Where the hell is he?
[151:48.62]What is this?
[151:51.58]Oh, a secret room!
[151:53.30]Secret fucking room!
[151:53.98]Are you serious?
[151:59.22]Do I not kill these guys?
[152:01.32]Oh, hold on.
[152:03.12]Oh god, I think I killed one of his cats.
[152:06.03]I'm so sorry.
[152:11.13]Tuna bait.
[152:20.36]Secret cat room.
[152:26.95]I didn't know.
[152:27.57]How was I supposed to know?
[152:39.84]Sorcery all over again.
[152:45.96]Oh shit.
[152:59.22]bitter bug there are so many bugs I want to investigate this not talk to you I'm about to kick this guy's ass in a second because can I investigate this
[153:24.61]Really?
[153:26.29]Is that like a tribute to Wilson from Castaway?
[153:29.03]I hope you stick with this.
[153:37.88]I haven't given up yet.
[153:40.28]Look, I'm one of those people that... You'll hear me complain.
[153:49.55]You're going to hear me talk a bunch of shit.
[153:52.14]Even if it's because of... Even if it's my fault.
[153:55.14]Might be my fault.
[154:00.28]That doesn't mean I don't enjoy the game.
[154:03.38]It's just venting frustrations.
[154:05.46]It's venting.
[154:06.13]That's all it is.
[154:16.71]But I really would love to find one of these guys.
[154:25.60]Go up to, like, eight?
[154:32.70]Yeah, I'm supposed to capture a great, uh, jag-eye, but... I haven't been able to find one.
[154:41.66]There's one!
[154:42.28]Okay.
[154:43.82]Let's do it.
[155:02.30]Cut the tail and bash his face.
[155:15.52]I need to clear this.
[155:18.16]Little baby cousin is not making it easy for me.
[155:33.35]Good combo.
[155:34.41]Good combo.
[155:36.01]I'm liking it.
[155:38.29]Ow.
[155:43.68]Thought he was going to attack me.
[155:58.14]Thought wrong, apparently.
[156:06.60]Damn it.
[156:09.09]Getting sloppy.
[156:48.01]Fight him again!
[157:19.08]You're doing good.
[157:19.80]Oh, thanks, man.
[157:21.62]Thanks for the positive reinforcement.
[157:30.04]Is he hurt?
[157:39.68]He's got to be hurt now, right?
[157:44.07]You got a limp on you yet?
[157:45.25]Not yet?
[157:49.75]I don't want to kill him.
[157:51.03]Is he... I don't want him to die.
[157:55.53]Alright, there's the limp, right?
[158:08.18]Yeah, there's the limp.
[158:11.30]Let's go chase him down.
[158:13.26]He's going to the cave.
[158:25.97]Right?
[158:32.45]Is he in that cave or is he asleep over here?
[158:34.31]No, I think he's in here.
[158:42.55]Is he in here?
[158:43.39]God damn it, I don't remember.
[158:44.60]No.
[158:48.88]No, he's not.
[158:52.76]I think he's the other way.
[158:55.56]I didn't paintball him.
[158:58.40]I forgot to fucking paintball him.
[159:02.22]It's okay.
[159:03.73]He can only be in like two places right now, right?
[159:10.81]He's not here.
[159:16.43]Five maybe?
[159:16.91]I don't see him anywhere.
[159:26.23]There he is.
[159:26.59]Okay.
[159:26.71]I'm going to get him.
[159:30.91]He's hurt right now, right?
[159:34.73]I can trap him now, can't I?
[159:39.35]Oh, get ready to eat shit.
[159:42.18]No!
[159:45.68]I got to get this ready.
[159:50.99]He's gonna be sleeping here.
[159:52.85]But won't all these people wake him up?
[159:55.90]Ah.
[159:56.86]Somebody's gonna wake him up, right?
[159:58.49]I can't, like, sneak through here.
[159:59.71]All these idiots are gonna wake him up.
[160:16.64]It's at this time that I seriously, like, I fucking hate fighting these small enemies.
[160:20.46]Like, honest to God, I'm going to complain again.
[160:23.92]Fighting these enemies without a lock-on seriously makes me want to rip my hair out of its sockets.
[160:34.65]Just, like, take a buzzer and just fucking shave my head.
[160:37.91]It's just, God.
[160:39.09]What year is this?
[160:40.15]And there's no lock-on?
[160:41.39]What fucking year are we in?
[160:57.20]Got him!
[161:00.66]No, where is it?
[161:02.80]Trank!
[161:03.34]Trank!
[161:03.92]Trank!
[161:04.76]Trank!
[161:05.69]Trank!
[161:06.99]Where the fuck- Trank bomb!
[161:08.99]Oh my god!
[161:15.32]Want me to complain about the fucking, the mini menu system too?
[161:18.90]It sucks.
[161:29.27]That's like the Dark Souls mini menu system, but way fucking worse.
[161:33.95]Like a thousand times worse.
[161:38.87]Oh boy, that's a lot of stuff.
[161:52.24]Seven.
[161:55.40]Holy shit, nice.
[161:59.06]You passed it twice?
[161:59.84]Yeah, because everything looks the same.
[162:01.72]The paintball and the tranq bomb are like the same artwork.
[162:06.19]They have like slightly different etchings.
[162:08.27]Oh god, somebody just gave me a hundred fucking dollars.
[162:12.99]Holy shit, dude.
[162:18.52]Uh... Anost.
[162:23.06]Anost or Anost.
[162:24.18]Thank you for the fucking 10,000 bits, dude.
[162:25.96]A hundred bucks.
[162:28.21]And Anos says, hey Jerma, I work in the oil industry, so we kind of make money from polluting this Earth with crap.
[162:34.34]Here's your cut for the Skate 3 stream.
[162:41.70]Yeah, well, thanks, dude.

[163:19.01]Yeah, I did.

[163:26.04]Uh, what else is in here?
[163:26.78]King's frill.
[163:29.93]What's the difference between being down here to see giant jaggy claw versus on this jaggy scale?
[163:36.93]Okay, giant.
[163:38.55]Oh my god!
[163:46.84]Wait, what?
[164:06.08]Did I get them?
[164:06.70]Did I get the important ones?
[164:08.74]I think I got the important ones, right?
[164:21.07]A fucking timer.
[164:22.23]Why would there be a timer?
[164:24.78]Why would there be a timer?
[164:28.66]I knew that yesterday, and I just didn't even fucking think about it.
[164:31.24]But why would they put a timer there?
[164:34.19]I can press the button.
[164:35.19]I can press A when I want to press A, man.

[166:58.12]Slightly increases attack.
[166:59.68]Increases the efficiency of meat that raises max stamina.
[167:03.36]And 50% likelihood reduce of being stunned.
[167:07.03]Okay.
[167:07.71]Cool.

[167:52.87]Armorsphere.
[167:53.75]Just do it, right?
[167:54.41]I should just fucking go for it, shouldn't I?
[168:01.23]I hope nobody tells me this is a terrible idea.
[168:08.60]What am I missing?
[168:09.12]Do I actually need to have these?
[168:27.17]I ran out of money.
[168:30.57]Can I do something here?
[168:32.59]Can I trade shit in?

[175:43.93]Okay, I need lots more money.
[175:50.54]Don't dump everything.
[175:51.46]Alright, well.
[175:56.81]This is the next step, right?
[175:58.95]Hey!
[176:00.43]You guys ready?
[176:02.53]To watch me kill more jaggies?
[176:10.45]Don't forge them.
[176:12.52]Why not?
[176:15.20]My phone is fucking blowing up right now.
[176:22.13]Don't craft them?
[176:23.09]Don't craft a jaggy weapon?
[176:28.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah, more jaggies.
[176:32.05]Let's go eat some food and fight some more fucking jaggies.
[176:41.47]Generate resource.
[176:49.04]25p, I can't do this more than once.
[176:55.17]Wait, hold on.
[176:58.92]No, it's just converting that.
[177:00.24]I don't want to do that.
[177:11.17]Oh, let's just go!
[177:18.75]I'm getting like lost in these fucking menus for seriously.
[177:25.01]Well, I can't.
[177:25.57]This is the thing I'm currently using.
[177:26.58]I can't upgrade it anyways.
[177:27.82]I need two Mala.
[177:29.02]Light.
[177:29.58]Mala.
[177:29.98]Maculcha Light.
[177:39.20]Alright, well, I need two Mala.
[177:40.84]How do I get two Malas?
[177:41.70]Do I have to just go mine shit?
[177:42.91]I'll just go mine.
[177:43.87]There was a Mala.
[177:44.81]Time for grinding.
[177:48.57]Yeah, isn't that converting that into...
[177:54.66]Like, generate resources.
[177:56.20]Isn't that me, like, essentially selling this?
[177:59.14]For 25 resources?
[178:00.30]I thought that's how it worked.
[178:13.85]I'm not going to do that yet.
[178:15.69]Let's just see.
[178:16.29]Bug hunt.
[178:18.21]Hunt an Azuros.
[178:22.79]You can buy them, too?
[178:23.71]Okay.
[178:30.23]Do I like this game?
[178:31.13]Yeah.
[178:32.07]I do.
[178:38.06]I'm kind of like getting sucked in.
[178:43.10]So who sells that?
[178:46.48]She doesn't sell it, does she?
[178:51.18]No.
[178:59.02]Nah, I'm just gonna go.
[179:00.96]I can mine it.
[179:01.54]I have a pickaxe, right?
[179:06.01]Yeah.
[179:07.25]Let's go.
[179:08.95]I'll run into a jaggy, maybe.
[179:10.07]Let's eat something.
[179:15.27]Did I already eat something?
[179:16.11]It's been so long.
[179:17.23]I've been in the menu for so fucking long.
[179:19.03]I haven't... No, I'm not eating shit.
[179:21.11]I'm not even hungry.
[179:21.78]Let's go.
[179:32.48]All I want is to mine anyways.
[179:33.58]I'm going up to like the water.
[179:50.75]What's Monster Hunter XX?
[180:00.15]Oh, we found a jaggy!
[180:02.59]You know what?
[180:10.03]You know what?
[180:10.75]Ah, okay, fine.
[180:11.77]Are you guys ready for the fucking jaggy hunt?
[180:13.89]Here it is.
[180:14.29]Eat for the bucks.
[180:20.65]You know, the upcoming one.
[180:35.72]You guys better go.
[180:39.77]He's dead?
[180:47.59]Good thing you didn't eat any food.
[180:51.37]That was like a thousand dollars to eat food.
[180:55.51]I need like, don't I need like four or five thousand?
[181:04.78]Now I'm just like being sloppy.
[181:06.65]I'm already sick of fighting these.
[181:11.25]And like I have to fight like fucking 10 more of them.
[181:15.59]I'm already getting sick of fighting the jaggies.
[181:17.31]But you know.
[181:18.54]Whatever.
[181:18.90]Food is cheap.
[181:40.31]Start limping.
[181:41.09]Come here.
[181:51.70]Unless I want the weapon, I don't have to do it.
[181:55.76]I kind of want it.
[182:01.24]I hate hunting these monsters.
[182:03.60]Well, no, I just hate hunting the same monster.
[182:07.08]I'm gonna die.
[182:27.74]Hmm...
[182:50.55]No, don't let them get away.
[182:52.79]Please.
[182:54.37]It's almost like they're just going to get away every fucking time.
[183:07.70]Still putting away my weapon to use items.
[183:09.64]Alright, here you go.
[183:10.16]Ready?
[183:11.34]My weapon's out right now.
[183:13.96]Weapon is out.
[183:18.12]Let's do like a wet stone for instance ready weapons out Slash slash hey use that weapon they put it back.
[183:25.89]Why is used weapon, right?
[183:33.01]Thanks slash slash us.
[183:33.85]Hey use that weapon with why?
[183:39.71]Is there like a certain thing I have to be doing
[183:45.64]Also, it might be a good idea to read about this weapon.
[183:50.54]Because I didn't do this.
[183:52.10]Is this the same one?
[184:16.36]Hold R then Y. I didn't even know that existed.
[184:19.14]I have to like read this shit.
[184:22.65]Oh god, let me read the book.
[184:26.31]Hey, let me, hey, guys.
[184:27.99]Anybody want to play Monster Hunter?
[184:29.97]Okay.
[184:30.53]Alright, you want to play the video game Monster Hunter?
[184:32.47]Okay, good.
[184:33.05]Sit down for a second.
[184:34.35]Watch 50 videos and read the entire game manual.
[184:38.67]Now you can play the game.
[184:42.88]Go watch like fucking 10 beginner videos on how to play this game.
[184:47.24]And then read everything to play the game.
[184:50.76]What the fuck?
[184:51.79]You know what I'm saying?
[184:52.49]Reading.
[185:17.24]This game doesn't hold my hand.
[185:18.24]No, no, that's not what I'm saying.
[185:19.42]It's just... You can't make fun of me for not knowing things that I did not know existed.
[185:27.47]Because I didn't play this game.
[185:28.81]You know, you can't... That's not fair!
[185:32.67]Look, I get it.
[185:33.79]You might have like 4,000 hours in Monster Hunter.
[185:37.83]I started last night.
[185:39.79]Come on, give me like a little bit of fucking slack.
[186:15.40]4,000 hours actually isn't that inaccurate to some players.
[186:18.99]Yeah, I'm sure it is.
[186:20.35]There's a lot to this game.
[186:33.75]Rich dentist?
[186:34.53]What are you talking about?
[186:49.04]Don't let him get away.
[186:49.74]Please let me just kill this one.
[186:57.33]Please.
[186:58.39]Please.
[186:59.43]Please.
[186:59.83]God in heaven.
[187:01.19]I'm going to pretend I did that.
[187:06.91]Is this Dark Souls for noobs or what?
[187:08.95]No.
[187:09.41]No.
[187:10.95]No.
[187:16.18]I would rather play Dark Souls with one hand tied behind my back.
[187:24.78]This game is much more complicated than Dark Souls is.
[187:30.30]Dark Souls is dodge, swing, swing, dodge, swing, swing.
[187:32.79]A lot more going on in this game.
[187:44.10]Playing like a rich dentist.
[187:53.13]Can I kill him already?
[187:55.63]Welcome to Monster Hunter.
[187:56.79]I would love if he would die.
[188:16.81]Oh, you're still playing it.
[188:17.67]That's right.
[188:18.83]That's right.
[188:20.31]I am still playing it.
[188:22.25]And now he's gonna... I'm gonna get back to my cave.
[188:25.32]Don't worry.
[188:25.94]I'll get there.
[188:26.76]Guaranteed.
[188:28.60]You don't have a trap?
[188:29.34]Bye.
[188:29.62]I'm gonna go through a rock.
[189:18.42]Brush your teeth and sharpen your blade.
[189:21.20]Are they both just sleeping here?
[189:38.28]Come on, I gotta hit him in the face so he launches backwards.
[189:47.55]It's been four hours and you're still hunting jaggies.
[189:49.77]Yeah, that's what you gotta do.
[189:52.35]You gotta hunt jaggies until you get the jaggies and then you go fight the other thing and fight the other thing for like four hours.
[190:11.63]Yeah, he's dead.
[190:12.03]There's one more, too.
[190:19.33]There he is!
[190:19.79]Nooo.
[190:22.63]Noooo.
[190:26.17]This is like a repeat of what happened last time, just don't kill me.
[190:36.81]I don't want any more screamers.
[190:37.77]I want to hide.
[190:47.60]I want to at least give another solid attempt at that second boss.
[190:51.02]Wait, what?
[191:12.19]What is this Crash Bandicoot music?
[191:19.88]Crash Bandicoot.
[191:42.92]Ugh.
[191:44.80]Get right in the butt!
[192:09.13]Not much time left.
[192:10.17]Clear out the baddies.
[192:27.39]Die, please.
[192:31.41]That should have canceled that.
[192:36.63]That should have canceled it, man.
[192:43.06]Come on, that should have canceled.
[192:44.76]Not fair.
[192:47.54]He's dead.
[192:57.68]Okay.
[192:59.96]What?
[193:00.48]Does anybody remember what I was doing?
[193:05.36]Like, 30 minutes ago, I was out to do something, and then I had to fight two jaggies for 30 minutes.
[193:16.33]I wanted to get, like... Okay, yeah.
[193:18.07]Malachite.
[193:18.99]Whatever.
[193:19.31]Malachite.
[193:20.57]You can't ever say that word.
[193:21.37]I'm sorry.
[193:25.35]I was gonna go mine at like 9, 10, and 11.
[193:27.77]Okay.
[193:29.20]That was the plan.
[193:41.86]Why is everybody calling me a dentist?
[193:47.75]Thank you, Warvoid, for the nine months.
[193:49.97]So happy to see you're playing this.
[193:51.39]Fights can get long, but it kind of makes it better, in my opinion.
[193:54.15]Also, switch axes are pretty great.
[193:58.51]Oh, yeah, I used the switch axe earlier.
[194:00.44]I kind of like this setup for now, though.
[194:06.20]This is, like, clean enough that it's easier to dodge and it's not slow.
[194:11.52]I feel like I'll just stick with this for a while.
[194:14.67]Wait, what?
[194:18.24]I need to look for nodes.
[194:25.64]Yeah, somebody's gonna fill me in on this dentist joke.
[194:29.76]Dentist?
[194:39.59]Free toothbrush?
[194:40.33]Nah, it's not free.
[194:41.59]Those toothbrushes are like 100 bits.
[194:48.08]Alright, I need to pay attention to see where anything is.
[194:50.46]Four.
[195:00.36]Four.
[195:00.88]Come on, give me some veins somewhere, right?
[195:11.49]Jump with a Loch Ness monster.
[195:28.78]Are they underwater?
[195:43.71]That's a $1 joke.
[195:46.21]Here's your toothbrush, sir.
[196:00.09]How many times have I complained about this game?
[196:01.57]I feel like we got a good solid complain about the game stream going.
[196:07.31]What do you think?
[196:07.73]I just want to mine.
[196:41.05]Thanks for the boost!
[196:46.98]I'm not really sure what I should be looking for here.
[196:48.74]Am I dying?
[196:51.08]Am I dead?
[196:53.58]What was that?
[196:53.96]That was so fucking weird.
[197:04.51]That is a vein.
[197:07.65]Let's get it!
[197:19.41]Alright.
[197:48.10]Give me one.
[197:50.06]Iron.
[197:50.36]Come on, give me two.
[197:52.12]Give me lucky.
[197:53.02]Ah!
[197:55.59]There we go.
[197:56.03]There's one.
[198:02.57]Shit.
[198:02.95]Only one.
[198:07.50]That's it.
[198:10.52]You almost got me.
[198:11.36]Almost.
[198:12.00]Almost.
[198:26.34]Hydro hide, I can't... Shit.
[198:41.39]Still hatefully loving it?
[198:44.17]Yeah, I mean, it's... I'm having so much trouble.
[198:49.91]I don't know what to... My feelings are all over the place right now.
[198:53.91]Because I fucking hate this.
[198:56.71]But I can't stop.
[198:57.81]I cannot stop doing it.
[198:59.17]Is that weird?
[199:06.21]You know, I felt pretty similar when I first played Dark Souls 2.
[199:11.60]Because I played Dark Souls 2 pretty much before I played Dark Souls 1.
[199:14.52]Because I'm a bad player, right?
[199:20.50]I wasn't having any fun.
[199:23.60]And I think your brain to play games like these, like these kind of harder, more complex games... You need to... You need to, like, get angry and, like, not understand it.
[199:34.61]And I'm not... How many times have I been like, I don't understand this.
[199:37.67]I just don't understand it.
[199:39.15]How could you possibly... I don't get it.
[199:42.09]And then eventually, you go, oh, like, three days from now, I'm gonna be like, oh, I was a fucking idiot.
[199:48.07]There's a reason for that.
[199:49.27]There's a reason why that exists.
[199:53.97]But I think I got everything I could here.
[199:57.99]That is how I felt 500 hours of gameplay ago.
[200:01.62]Exactly.
[200:02.08]Oh, look at my stamina.
[200:09.78]It's so bad.
[200:13.90]I don't think I have any food either.
[200:25.10]But it's like a natural reaction, right?
[200:27.88]Like a natural human reaction to things you don't understand.
[200:32.96]Is like, I don't like this.
[200:36.41]But something is keeping me playing.
[200:39.31]It's obviously the fact that the game's fun.
[200:44.24]It's interesting enough.
[200:48.90]I wish I could find another vein, though.
[200:56.22]Am I playing with a new character?
[200:57.12]No, I'm not.
[201:04.45]This is how everyone reacts to Monster Hunter.
[201:06.49]You're fine.
[201:09.31]Well, that's good to know that I'm not just being like a angry, frustrated person.
[201:17.77]I am definitely out of my comfort zone for sure.
[201:19.47]Let me check this rocky area over here.
[201:29.67]Do I even have any food?
[201:30.45]I don't think I even have anything to eat.
[201:47.44]Can I just chew on some rocks?
[201:50.74]No, I can... Yeah, I can make something.
[201:53.34]I'll make some food up here.
[201:58.02]What made you decide playing in the first place?
[202:03.61]It was requested.
[202:04.29]People were like, I would love to watch you play Monster Hunter.
[202:08.04]Play Monster Hunter.
[202:08.72]It's great.
[202:12.58]So I was like, okay.
[202:13.72]If that many people think that this is good, then why not try it?
[202:26.61]Rare steak.
[202:27.23]No, I don't want it.
[202:51.70]Is there any ore?
[202:53.71]Come on, I just need one more.
[202:55.09]No, I've never played RuneScape before.
[203:05.21]I've seen people play RuneScape, I've watched it be played, but not me myself.
[203:10.99]Or Irene.
[203:13.45]You know.
[203:14.89]If you like movie jokes.
[203:27.16]Not seeing any more veins.
[203:29.82]Unfortunately.
[203:34.50]The blue ones are the ones that have Demalic chiding it, right?
[203:40.89]When are me and Kim going to have a smashdown in Smash Brothers?
[203:44.69]I don't know.
[203:54.31]I'm going to go to the cave.
[203:55.26]I would do that.
[204:04.46]It would be fun.
[204:10.46]People generally regard these games as good, but they're kind of niche in my opinion.
[204:15.52]I just couldn't get into Monster Hunter personally.
[204:17.26]I thought fighting the monsters was dull when I would play for a few hours.
[204:23.31]Yeah.
[204:25.23]It really depends.
[204:26.97]Hold on.
[204:27.21]I've got to clear my throat.
[204:28.73]Excuse me.
[204:29.19]Sorry.
[204:31.39]Sparklies.
[204:31.87]Wait.
[204:34.17]Yeah.
[204:54.43]Dark Souls was supposed to be niche, but people got into it.
[204:56.93]Yeah.
[204:58.79]I think Dark Souls, especially the newer ones, have much higher production value than these games do.
[205:10.69]I might be completely wrong on that, though.
[205:14.03]Because this one is a few years old, right?
[205:18.39]When did Bloodborne come out?
[205:19.99]2014?
[205:26.84]Yeah, I thought these games were really popular.
[205:29.92]Like, really, really popular.
[205:31.82]That was in The Oppression.
[205:41.47]This is a game from 2009.
[205:42.15]Okay.
[205:47.45]So why would they port this shit so long?
[205:50.05]Oh, wait.
[205:50.27]That doesn't make any sense.
[205:53.08]I don't even care if this thing's on me.
[205:55.52]Come on.
[205:56.20]Shit.
[205:58.02]Give me... I just need one more so I can upgrade my damn weapon.
[206:08.68]Fortunate.
[206:17.42]They don't want to upgrade the engine and ruin the controls that people are addicted to.
[206:28.92]You make this game a little bit more... I mean, this is just me speaking personal preference-wise.
[206:36.24]If this game played like Dark Souls... If this game was on the Bloodborne engine... I could foresee this being one of the best games I've ever played.
[206:48.65]So, like, FromSoftware, I should just do it, right?
[206:51.73]I shouldn't be in here because I don't have any... Ah.
[206:57.38]Just, I gotta discard it.
[206:58.86]I... I can't be in here right now.
[207:02.88]I just need ore.
[207:03.74]They're popular in Japan.
[207:11.59]Yeah, I thought so.
[207:15.55]I'll go to seven.
[207:15.89]Seven.
[207:23.19]Platinum was trying to make a similar game, but it got canceled.
[207:37.39]Scalebound?
[207:43.35]That is so unfortunate.
[207:47.08]That game seemed like it was really, really far into the dev cycle.
[207:51.12]Just to get fucking canned.
[207:53.92]I wonder why.
[207:56.52]What possibly could have been going wrong where that huge AAA Platinum Games Microsoft exclusive got canceled?
[208:14.57]Let's wrap around to four again.
[208:20.84]I've heard this game is much more fun with friends.
[208:28.26]Are these respawned yet?
[208:29.09]There we go.
[208:31.07]Please.
[208:32.87]No Earth crystals.
[208:35.45]No Earth crystal.
[208:38.01]No.
[208:40.47]Ah.
[208:45.99]Shit.
[208:46.37]Shit.
[208:49.63]They worked on it for 10 years.
[208:50.89]Must have been a huge money sink.
[208:52.21]That sucks.
[209:02.35]That sucks so bad.
[209:05.69]Don't you wish that there was a way for these game companies to just release it?
[209:12.54]You know what I mean?
[209:13.56]If you're gonna delete the whole thing.
[209:17.65]Remove everything.
[209:18.87]The game is fucking deleted.
[209:20.53]It's canceled.
[209:22.85]I'm out of here.
[209:23.19]God damn it.
[209:26.26]I don't know my axes.
[209:33.62]Great.
[209:37.14]But if you're going to cancel a game, and all of its assets are going to be deleted...
[209:44.28]Why wouldn't you just, like, just release it?
[209:46.28]Just, like, throw it up on, like, a website or something.
[209:48.34]Be like, here you go.
[209:49.24]Just check it out.
[209:52.42]This is what we were doing.
[209:53.28]Cool, huh?
[210:04.48]Hunter realm.
[210:07.56]What's going on?
[210:09.36]I kind of don't even want to listen to this right now.
[210:12.52]Is this drug?
[210:13.10]Remember that game, Drug Wars?
[210:14.24]I feel like that's what this is.
[210:15.30]Yeah, I don't know.
[210:16.06]Whatever.
[210:16.28]Bye.
[210:18.64]Come here, you.
[210:19.02]I want to talk to you.

[210:28.64]Take items.

[210:34.13]Oh, he does!
[210:35.59]You fucking legend.
[210:37.54]You legendary little sack boy.
[210:41.44]Nice.
[210:42.56]Oh, look at all this stuff he picked up.
[210:47.11]Wow.

[211:28.80]And there are.
[211:30.38]But the one that I played, it was a little on the slow side, so...

[212:29.56]So, I upgrade the sword and shield.
[212:31.50]Get it up.
[212:32.62]See what happens.
[212:37.14]Let's just do it.

[214:19.46]No!
[214:19.62]No!
[214:23.96]I'm serious.
[214:25.02]I'm serious.
[214:25.64]This is unnecessary.
[214:28.87]Don't worry.
[214:29.63]I'll be okay.
[214:32.19]Anyway, I've got investments.
[214:33.81]You know what I mean?
[214:34.85]I've got investments.

[214:40.29]Yeah.

[215:34.96]So I'm not going to say any more words.
[215:38.13]I'm not talking anymore.
[215:39.71]I'm going to just fucking play Monster Hunter.

[216:50.52]Hey, talk about the control scheme and how much you hate the control scheme.
[216:55.21]It's a self-justification thing.
[217:02.23]Look, any time that you're doing poorly, just show yourself a dumb crossbow.
[217:06.43]I'm not going to use that.
[217:14.10]Anytime you're doing something poorly, and it takes a long time to earn, you like, you need to like tell people.

[230:30.81]GG.
[230:37.71]I'm going to clear this.
[230:39.37]I feel like it's going to be a major issue in a moment.
[230:45.85]Really?
[231:04.91]No, not what I wanted to do.
[231:11.09]Just do it now.
[231:23.10]I got the weapon.

[232:36.30]Here he goes.
[232:37.92]He's in two.
[232:46.25]No, wow, he's moving around.
[232:47.29]He's moving quick.
[232:49.49]He's down at seven.
[233:00.44]Get over here.
[233:04.72]What the hell is he doing?
[233:08.64]He's ringing the bell.
[233:10.56]I don't know what that means He's freaking me out with this shit
[233:34.88]Damn it, come on.
[233:42.32]Fuck!
[233:45.55]What's that mean?
[233:46.01]What's that mean?
[233:46.65]Do I have to blow up his sack?
[233:47.79]I think I gotta blow his sack up.
[234:03.41]His wings are, like, just blocking his damage.
[234:05.49]I'm gonna stay behind him.
[234:09.43]I think I'm gonna have to use this stone here.
[234:27.42]No.
[234:27.90]Whoops.
[234:28.16]It's okay.
[234:29.48]Forgot to hold R.
[234:46.31]He's got an interesting hitbox.
[234:56.49]It's like right down Main Street.
[234:58.32]Right in the face?
[234:59.12]I don't know.
[234:59.80]I can't even tell.
[235:03.66]Please.
[235:07.54]No!
[235:08.50]I'm stunned!
[235:11.79]Where did this fucking rocket raccoon come from?
[235:13.89]Get out of here, dude!
[235:21.96]Seriously, please get the fuck away from me.
[235:25.75]No.
[235:27.75]Oh, I just stole my map.
[235:29.77]I stole my map.
[235:31.01]Hold on, come back here.
[235:32.47]I need that map.
[235:33.75]I need that map.
[235:36.37]Come here, please.
[235:37.71]No.
[235:39.26]No.
[235:39.54]I so badly need that map.
[235:45.36]Oh, I got the map.
[235:45.94]Thank God.
[235:48.96]I was supposed to seriously have a mental breakdown.
[235:57.18]The body just like was clenched right there.
[235:59.06]Don't flap those wings.
[236:25.80]Please get down on the ground.
[236:34.36]His wings... Is he... Is he taking off?
[236:47.05]I can hit the wings from behind, I think.
[236:48.47]Oh, here comes Rocket Raccoon again.
[236:50.38]Gonna steal my fucking map.
[236:59.24]I can hit him right in the egg sack.
[237:12.07]Can't be much longer now.
[237:18.25]Can't be longer.
[237:18.93]No, not this shit again.
[237:20.29]Not this shit again.
[237:21.93]No.
[237:23.07]Don't do this to me.
[237:24.63]Do not do this to me.
[237:25.61]Please.
[237:26.56]Just die.
[237:28.18]Just please die.
[237:35.12]You have to bring your best friend in here too, don't you?
[237:51.65]Come on.
[237:53.83]Where are both the weapons?
[237:54.93]Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[238:01.60]Where did he go?
[238:03.58]Where's the other one?
[238:12.22]Roll, please.
[238:15.66]Where'd the other guy go?
[238:20.40]I think the other guy just took off.
[238:24.59]I'm not in a good position to use one of these.
[238:38.40]Where did my friend go?
[238:45.54]No shit!
[238:48.82]Yes!
[238:49.10]Okay, we're good.
[238:51.70]I'm gonna be fine.
[238:52.24]Gonna take off again.
[238:55.09]There he goes!
[239:02.45]He's going to three.
[239:13.02]He should die now, right?
[239:14.80]It's kind of... This is getting a little out of hand.
[239:31.65]He can't have much health.
[239:36.83]I've upgraded this thing.
[239:37.71]This weapon is a good weapon, isn't it?
[239:39.39]There it is.
[239:41.01]No, not quite.
[239:48.34]I didn't dodge that.
[239:49.76]I don't like that at all.
[239:51.94]Fucking hell.
[240:14.32]He got me again.
[240:18.52]And here comes his buddy again.
[240:19.77]Here comes his one dickhead friend that keeps on finding him somehow.
[240:26.45]Got him!
[240:29.27]Feed him while he's down!
[240:30.09]Take him while he's down!
[240:31.07]Take him while he's down!
[240:32.51]Just cut the neck!
[240:37.22]This is so stressful.
[240:38.80]It really is.
[240:40.52]I can't even imagine what this is gonna be like later.
[240:54.80]Use the dung bombs?
[240:55.64]I feel like he's close enough where I can just get him.
[241:00.68]I have a 50 minute time limit, yep.
[241:18.51]Where did you guys come from?
[241:21.53]All of Jurassic Park gets to join us now.
[241:39.62]Paintball wore off, did it?
[241:44.16]Paintball, paintball, paintball, paintball, paintball, paintball.
[241:51.47]Got it.
[241:57.22]So am I doing this wrong?
[241:58.72]No.
[242:00.50]I don't think so.
[242:02.08]I'm fairly certain that it just takes a very long time to kill enemies.
[242:06.98]Maybe I'm not quite ready for this guy.
[242:08.54]The weapon sucks.
[242:11.78]I upgraded this thing.
[242:14.09]How can it suck?
[242:15.11]I've upgraded it.
[242:27.15]He's trying to get away.
[242:29.53]He fell down trying to get away.
[242:30.37]That means he's hurt.
[242:34.63]He's like tripping up now.
[242:40.98]I got him.
[242:44.30]Dung bomb?
[242:45.90]Dung bomb.
[242:46.34]You got it.
[242:49.12]Oh wait, actually.
[242:56.45]I get this I I thought the dung bomb just was like a flash grenade you threw in the ground and they all ran away Where's he going?
[243:25.55]Yeah, I thought it was just like a BANG!
[243:27.05]You toss a leg in the ground and it makes everything leave the area.
[243:29.45]I just dunged my- Well, at least I lose that guy.
[243:45.88]I can't believe he's still alive.
[243:50.77]This dude is still alive.
[244:08.07]His buddy didn't show up, right?
[244:14.93]He got him on the ropes.
[244:28.00]He's gotta be getting close. This is like... This is like... This is like, wha?
[244:42.66]It's too stressful, man.
[244:48.51]So, is this game designed to be played with four people?
[244:51.11]Is that, like, the problem I'm having right now?
[244:53.49]Do I need, like, three friends to play this game?
[245:02.14]He's healing himself?
[245:02.88]How do I start going... I don't have anything.
[245:23.54]Online is harder.
[245:27.41]I just suck.
[245:28.79]What am I doing wrong?
[245:30.21]I'm beating the fuck out of this guy.
[245:32.13]He's just not dying.
[245:38.75]I've hit this guy probably 400 times.
[245:41.49]There has to be something I'm doing wrong.
[245:50.01]Listen to how intense the music is.
[246:08.25]Oh, there we go!
[246:10.07]There we go!
[246:13.39]He's fucked now.
[246:14.13]He's fucked.
[246:19.80]Fuck this, hold on a second.
[246:21.46]Oh shit, he got away.
[246:28.12]We're, we're, we're, we're, we're down.
[246:29.56]Three.
[246:30.52]Two.
[246:30.72]I don't want him to heal.
[246:58.30]Come back this way so I don't leave the area, please.
[247:02.94]Come on.
[247:04.73]Come on.
[247:05.41]Follow me this way.
[247:08.57]Before your other friend gets here.
[247:20.99]Back it up.
[247:24.05]Die.
[247:37.22]Die.
[247:39.14]Die so I can... There you go.
[247:40.60]Oh, my leg.
[247:48.00]Come on.
[247:50.33]Where's my... I have a trap, don't I?
[247:52.79]Maybe I don't.
[247:58.88]this is just this is getting a little ridiculous seven seven under level that might be the case but I mean here he comes again eat some rations yeah that's a good idea
[248:28.04]Although, I might not even need to.
[248:29.10]He might just die a couple more hits.
[248:37.12]Use Sonic Bombs?
[248:38.64]I don't even have them on my inventory right now.
[248:41.95]That's it!
[248:43.33]No, it's not it!
[248:48.93]Get!
[248:50.61]Get!
[248:54.59]That had to have been it!
[248:55.91]Come on!
[249:03.52]Now he's just running back and forth like an idiot.
[249:11.11]I've been saying a couple more hits for a half an hour.
[249:12.61]I really have.
[249:15.39]Now he's calling me confused.
[249:19.86]I'm stunned now too.
[249:20.78]If I die here, if I die here, I'm turning the fucking Wii U off.
[249:24.84]I'm just gonna- I'm gonna like- I'm gonna grab the Wii U and fucking like throw it into another dimension if I die right there.
[249:35.45]God.
[249:54.09]He's running away again.
[249:54.97]Give me a ration.
[250:01.16]Where is he heading?
[250:04.98]I'm running out of time here.
[250:07.22]Two?
[250:09.28]Like, legit, I'm running out of items.
[250:20.35]I need to, like, paintball him again.
[250:23.34]He's gotta die right now.
[250:24.44]He has to die now.
[250:26.10]You gotta die now.

[255:17.40]It's garbage.
[255:24.91]You're doing fine with sword and shield?
[255:26.53]So, is it an issue with...
[255:30.67]Need a better upgraded weapon Or is that just the way it is take a break yeah after that like that last fight seriously I Don't think I've never even in like World of Warcraft Those you guys that raided in WoW
[255:53.81]Even like the raid bosses were like 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
[255:57.44]That was like 20 fucking minutes.
[256:05.44]It's pretty bad for a while.
[256:11.99]Anyone who says Sword and Shield is garbage is the great sword goober who hits everyone online.
[256:23.11]All the weapons are balanced.
[256:24.01]I'll stick with it.
[256:25.63]I'll just stick with it.
[256:35.75]Monsters typically take 15 to 30 minutes unless you're overgeared.
[256:38.35]Wow.
[256:39.81]Holy shit.
[256:46.63]Shotgun I missed.
[256:52.43]Oh.
[256:54.53]If I had died... Honestly, if I had died there... At that point where I almost died after, like, fucking 20 minutes... I... I would have just gone and drank my... I would have just gone and, like, drank a bottle of booze.
[257:09.84]I'm not going to bed.
[257:16.32]But, okay.
[257:17.27]I'm going to give you my real, honest opinion.
[257:19.27]Honest, honest, honest.
[257:20.43]Honest Abe Lincoln here.
[257:23.42]Uh, yesterday I thought this game was fun.
[257:26.20]I was like, oh, this is interesting.
[257:27.42]Okay, alright, cool, cool.
[257:29.55]Fought, like, a little couple of monsters.
[257:33.51]It went from fun to I hate this game.
[257:37.71]Like, two hours ago, three hours ago, I was like, I fucking don't like this game.
[257:43.24]And now we've got past that.
[257:45.30]And I really actually am, like, enjoying it.
[257:47.62]So...
[257:51.12]We'll see.
[257:52.30]I might just stream this tomorrow.
[258:00.87]Hater.
[258:04.77]I'm gonna give it the actual chance that I think it probably deserves.
[258:08.57]So...
[258:17.22]I think I'll be live with this tomorrow, because this is an off schedule.
[258:22.07]I just wanted to see if this is something that I wanted to stream tomorrow, essentially.
[258:28.17]So we might open with something and then close with this, or we might open with this and close with something else.
[258:41.08]But we'll see when we get there.
[258:46.00]I will at least go try out some of the online stuff tomorrow.

[258:55.69]Wait, no, don't go.
[259:00.51]Yeah.
[259:00.93]For all my complaints, I'd have to just yell complaints because I'm a fucking complainer when it comes to games like these.
[259:07.29]You guys watched me play Dark Souls.
[259:09.76]What's the point of that?
[259:10.58]I don't understand it.
