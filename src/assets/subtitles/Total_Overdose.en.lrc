[00:26.65]Hello, family.
[00:30.52]Imagine having a family this big.
[00:33.82]Does anybody have a family that has this many people in it?
[00:39.30]It's like thousands of people.
[00:41.76]Two, three, four hundred.
[00:42.98]Two thousand, three thousand brothers and sisters.
[00:46.57]Is this what it's like to be a bug?
[00:50.15]Because they have an ant.
[00:51.57]Nobody even talks about that.
[00:54.15]How fucking crazy is that?
[00:56.26]first of all.
[00:58.26]It's painful and hard to have like two or three children as a human.
[01:05.29]Can you imagine if you came out of your mother and there were 27,000 other relatives that came out too?
[01:16.24]How fucked up that would be.
[01:19.32]No wonder the animal kingdom forgets they have children and they go out on their own and they go do things by themselves.
[01:24.74]You can't keep track of that many people.
[01:27.69]That's like a country's worth of people.
[01:33.45]Anyways.
[01:35.70]There it is.
[01:36.74]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[01:37.82]Tonight we're gonna play a game that's been requested.
[01:41.50]And it looks like it could be fairly ridiculous.
[01:43.84]I don't know.
[01:45.96]We're on a... We're on like a three-string here of sort of ridiculous games.
[01:54.54]So tomorrow, we're going to relax.
[01:57.34]We're going to take a step back from a little bit of the nonsense.
[02:00.89]We're going to build the robot lab tomorrow.
[02:05.39]We're a little early, too.
[02:06.41]That's true.
[02:10.21]And maybe we'll have a couple of drinks.
[02:12.72]So I can forget that people hate me.
[02:15.68]During that stream.
[02:17.12]Because I'm so self-conscious about this stream tomorrow.
[02:22.28]I'm like, wait, hold on.
[02:23.14]People were not happy.
[02:24.28]People were bored.
[02:26.36]I gotta drink and have fun.
[02:31.80]I like never drink, too.
[02:32.92]That's the thing.
[02:34.74]I drink like once a month, maybe.
[02:37.22]Maybe like once every couple months.
[02:40.07]But if you're going to be building a child's cardboard toy, what else is the time besides the present there, right?
[02:49.72]But anyways, we're going to play Total Overdose tonight.
[02:54.14]It's an old one.
[02:55.36]It's currently available on GOG.com.
[03:00.27]And I'm looking forward to it.
[03:02.87]We'll see if it's bad.
[03:05.25]It might be.
[03:08.13]GOG.com.
[03:10.98]No, not P-O-G.
[03:14.24]Yeah, you can get it at Gog... Gogchamp.
[03:18.76]But, uh, we might have to play around with some stuff here because the game is... Uh, not... Every old video game has these problems.
[03:27.77]With a ton of licensed music, potentially, that I might have to turn off.
[03:32.64]on top of the fact that it is very loud and it's one of those fun video games where they pre-rendered and pre-loaded up all the cutscenes to a point where half of the game is ear blast loud and the other part is you can adjust it so this is one of those fun games where all the cutscenes are going to be very loud so just be aware of that
[03:55.96]And by the way, spoilers for Infinity War, that's a very loud movie.
[04:00.28]So if you, I don't know if you've even seen it yet, it's a loud movie.
[04:06.27]Alright, let's go.
[04:08.13]Give me like two seconds.
[04:24.56]My mic is off?
[04:26.98]Hold on.
[04:27.86]Are you sure?
[04:29.32]Let me see if I can fix that for you.
[04:33.86]How's it now?
[04:37.36]Because I've got the fan on.
[04:42.97]Because now it's about to be inside of an airplane.
[04:48.17]How's that?
[04:51.01]Should I move this around to make it so it's not right in the mic?
[04:56.05]You alright with that?
[04:59.76]How's that?
[05:02.46]I think we're good.
[05:04.45]Talking to the fan.
[05:05.21]The fan's on a microphone.
[05:06.11]I just got it for circulation.
[05:08.35]I need to circulate the air in this room.
[05:12.45]Put it right against the mic.
[05:13.51]No, no.
[05:13.97]Alright, I'll be right back.
[05:14.67]We're going to start Total Overdose BRB G2G.
[05:43.70]Someone's asking if there's going to be a face cam.
[05:45.10]No, no face cam.
[05:45.88]You're going to get a lot of face and camera tomorrow.
[05:50.10]That's where we're building the Labo stuff on stream.
[05:56.69]Oh, $50.
[05:58.15]$50.
[05:58.61]$50 just came in.
[06:02.59]Thank you to Puffmatius Jam.
[06:06.63]Puffmatius Jam for the $50.
[06:08.35]5,000 bits.
[06:08.63]Thanks a lot, man.
[06:12.10]And we haven't even started.
[06:15.30]Thank you.
[06:17.36]And they say, here's the money you were craving pre-stream.
[06:20.46]Every last bit.
[06:22.94]Seriously though, love the stream.
[06:24.17]Been a fan for years.
[06:24.91]Keep up the good stuff.
[06:25.79]Thank you.
[06:27.51]We had a little pre-stream conversation in the chat if you weren't around.
[06:31.69]Talked about money.
[06:32.55]We talked about some monetary stuff and different avenues and revenues and earnings and estimates.
[06:42.23]But, uh, thank you, Puff.
[06:45.01]Incredibly generous of you.
[06:45.84]Thank you so much.
[06:47.36]And then one more came in.
[06:48.88]$10 came in here right now.
[06:50.54]By, uh, Berry Rice.
[06:53.72]Or Berry Rice.
[06:55.12]Bear Rice.
[06:57.26]I don't know if I'm doing that right, but thank you so much for $10.
[07:00.60]Jeremy, you've legitimately made me laugh more times than I care to count.
[07:03.78]Please keep being awesome.
[07:05.32]We love you.
[07:06.11]Thank you.
[07:09.61]Appreciate it, guys.
[07:10.63]Seriously.
[07:11.91]And now, let's go.
[07:16.18]This part of the game is extremely loud.
[07:17.82]I already licked it.
[07:18.38]I already did it.
[07:20.70]Yeah, you don't want to eat that.
[07:21.66]I already licked it.
[07:22.38]You don't want to touch that.
[07:23.14]I already licked it.
[07:24.21]See, it's mine.
[07:25.69]Very loud.
[07:26.31]There it is.
[07:29.47]I have the audio set to like 22 percentile right now.
[07:37.17]Uh, so, I... We're gonna have to deal with this for a few minutes.
[07:41.59]And here comes the licensed music.
[07:43.43]New game, Total Overdose.
[07:44.41]Let's go.
[07:49.19]You play as, like, a drug-busting DEA cartel drug buster.
[07:53.32]I don't know.
[07:54.72]Where are we?
[08:08.51]Subtitles up top.
[08:09.90]See?
[08:14.04]DEA.
[08:16.30]Let's go.
[08:20.46]And you guys thought Half-Life had cool cutscene transitions?
[08:24.57]We just saw an awesome one.
[08:25.53]And it's going to be very quiet, and I know, but we'll turn it up in a second.
[08:27.85]Hold on.
[08:29.01]Most want us to fire.
[08:31.15]Use the mouse to look around, yeah.
[08:32.01]Okay.
[08:38.95]Glad we got to play for three seconds.
[08:41.14]Okay.
[08:45.32]Really?
[08:52.10]What?
[08:52.42]Okay.
[08:52.94]Oh, there's a shot.
[08:53.78]Whoa, to climb.
[08:54.54]Move in the direction of the object you want to climb onto.
[08:57.73]I just necked myself.
[08:59.67]I just jumped on my own neck.
[09:01.07]Okay, so just walk towards stuff.
[09:04.65]You can change your weapons using scroll wheel down and scroll wheel up.
[09:07.23]Alright, reload.
[09:08.11]I'm sure.
[09:09.67]Okay, a hunting rifle.
[09:10.90]Is there like an aim down sights?
[09:12.58]No.
[09:13.56]So what is this?
[09:16.54]Is it a rewind button?
[09:19.46]What?
[09:19.80]You just picked up a rewind.
[09:21.12]Use it to turn back time.
[09:23.64]This is not something I expected to be in this game.
[09:27.36]Why is this in the game?
[09:30.35]Okay, this has gotten way more interesting.
[09:32.61]Why?
[09:33.49]Why is there a rewind?
[09:36.45]Okay.
[09:38.25]I'll take it.
[09:39.95]You just picked up a rewind.
[09:41.03]No, I don't need to use it.
[09:43.48]I already know how it works.
[09:45.84]We'll be stuck here forever.
[09:46.72]Alright, let's take the hunting rifle.
[09:49.48]I gotta go look at the indicator on the map there.
[09:54.75]Gotta get rid of this guy.
[09:58.07]Did you fly planes in this game?
[09:59.07]This could be a 50 out of 50 game.
[10:09.51]Wait, what?
[10:13.23]Oh, that's okay.
[10:13.73]You can... What is that?
[10:15.04]When I hold down right click, it like aims at their head.
[10:18.96]Alright.
[10:19.90]Should we do that again?
[10:22.24]You guys want to see that again?
[10:23.20]I can't wait to rewind...
[10:28.28]Oh, this is gonna be fun.
[10:29.70]I'm looking forward to this.
[10:31.97]It just turns on aimbot.
[10:34.27]Does this explode?
[10:36.03]Oh, it sure does.
[10:36.79]Alright, let's go.
[10:38.95]Turn this on, get the plane, stop the drug... get the drug bust.
[10:46.63]I'm not gonna rewind that.
[10:47.81]Not right now.
[10:50.09]Get on the airplane.
[10:56.94]Shoot, dodge, press space.
[11:00.50]Of course it's in this game.
[11:03.36]Of course it is.
[11:04.60]Why wouldn't there be a Max Payne slow motion?
[11:13.23]What happens if I go like this?
[11:14.29]Wait, wait, wait!
[11:17.53]Okay, we're fine.
[11:20.75]Just rewind, it didn't happen.
[11:24.02]Who are these guys?
[11:24.98]Who's on the right?
[11:25.60]Am I on the wrong team?
[11:26.83]Oh, this is DEA.
[11:28.53]Okay.
[11:30.27]Alright, get on the plane.
[11:33.22]You can die.
[11:35.16]You can be dead and use the rewind.
[11:36.64]That seems a little unfair.
[11:40.75]Should have done that job blindfold.
[11:43.05]Would have been more of a challenge that way.
[11:44.95]You've always been fast, Ernesto.
[11:47.17]But maybe you should try exercising your brain sometimes.
[11:51.30]Wait, what?
[11:51.74]What?
[11:51.94]Papa Muerte thanks you for your hard work.
[11:55.32]Oh, shit.
[11:55.72]There was a why.
[11:56.80]My father didn't die of an overdose.
[11:58.84]It was a plot created by Papa Muerte with one of our own agents.
[12:02.17]I got double-crossed.
[12:03.03]And the agent is still operating from within these walls.
[12:06.11]Now, listen, Cruz.
[12:07.57]Your father's death came as a shock to all of us.
[12:10.57]But to accuse another agent is a serious... That's the colonel from Metal Gear Solid.
[12:14.65]You better have something to back this up.
[12:16.37]And dad from Ben 10.
[12:18.45]Is it dad or is it granddad?
[12:20.68]After hearing nothing about my father's murder for years, I get a hot lead.
[12:25.26]I befriended Marco, a local small-time crook who wanted a favor.
[12:29.58]He told me that Cesar Morales...
[12:31.62]local gang boss all my tequilas one night had bragged of knowing about my father's death
[12:38.68]the volume is going to be all over the place so I'm sorry about this but I have to turn this volume up a little
[13:04.79]It's going to be up, it's going to be down.
[13:05.81]You're going to have to be careful here.
[13:07.09]Make sure your speakers are on an audible level where you're comfortable and it's not going to blow it out.
[13:14.41]The plot's going way too fast.
[13:15.83]It is.
[13:19.45]So wait, did we rewind to two weeks ago?
[13:22.12]Did I take the truck with me in my time travel?
[13:23.92]Or is this two weeks before that two weeks ago?
[13:26.72]Because I was sitting in that guy's office injured and we went back in time like a couple years and now we're going back in time in the back in time two weeks before that.
[13:37.07]Okay.
[13:41.89]That was a different person.
[13:44.14]What?
[13:45.60]That wasn't me?
[13:58.20]Look, come on.
[13:59.65]Nobody give me shit for that.
[14:00.73]You did that in Ocarina of Time.
[14:02.41]It's the same thing.
[14:03.05]Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[14:09.55]I need to, uh... Hopefully this doesn't crash.
[14:11.69]I need to turn the volume up.
[14:13.78]Be careful with this volume here, guys.
[14:16.38]I can't control it.
[14:17.62]Just be aware that during cutscenes, just turn your speakers down a little.
[14:23.20]Is that better?
[14:25.71]Let's test.
[14:37.71]I can't hit the eagle.
[14:38.57]I have three bullets.
[14:39.53]Fucking god damn it.
[14:40.27]Alright, let's go.
[14:40.73]W accelerates.
[14:43.38]S is brake.
[14:44.06]E is to get in and out of the vehicle.
[14:51.94]He's alright.
[14:52.82]Wait, hold on.
[14:53.36]Is he on the ground still?
[14:56.00]No, he's fine.
[14:58.85]Wow, okay.
[14:59.51]Well, by the way, guys, I'm sure you're aware of this.
[15:01.81]A drivable car, one full letter grade.
[15:03.95]Crew's here.
[15:05.05]Everything is A-OK on my first job as a gangbanger.
[15:08.13]Good.
[15:09.13]Now open the door and get ready to jump ship before you hit the tanker.
[15:14.23]Wait, you can ghost ride cars in this game?
[15:17.39]Oh, my God.
[15:18.53]To perform the exit vehicle stunt, press and hold mouse 2 and open the car door and then press mouse 1 to dive out of the car.
[15:26.35]Oh, wow.
[15:27.89]Are you serious?
[15:37.98]That was cool.
[15:38.88]Alright, let's go.
[15:39.60]Give me that shotgun.
[15:47.17]Ooh, I like that turnaround.
[15:48.53]Is it a melee weapon?
[15:49.51]I can do it.
[15:49.81]Can you just rake?
[15:50.49]Do I throw the rake or do I swing the rake?
[15:59.41]This thing's like... Can I dive and rake?
[16:03.18]I don't think I can dive and rake.
[16:04.32]Oh wait, that guy... How... That guy also... How did I get a shovel?
[16:13.12]It just turned from rake to shovel.
[16:17.21]Oh no, don't kill me!
[16:25.63]That guy just shot himself in the head.
[16:27.05]That guy was on the ground and just blew his brains out.
[16:34.84]Oh, destroy the van.
[16:35.72]I need help.
[16:36.42]What do you... get in this one?
[16:38.08]Alright, I'm gonna try and do this.
[16:44.04]Destroy the van.
[16:45.82]That van.
[16:50.58]I love how you can just ace Ventura the car.
[16:53.14]Alright, through here.
[16:55.02]How am I driving this?
[16:57.38]That doesn't make any sense.
[16:59.61]To aim the mouse to use the explosive items, then mouse 1 to shoot.
[17:03.67]Shoot?
[17:03.91]Oh, I gotta shoot the barrels.
[17:04.91]Okay.
[17:15.88]Got it.
[17:22.65]Hit the barrels with the shovel.
[17:24.29]Oh, wait, hold on.
[17:24.87]Okay, I gotta play good here.
[17:30.93]Got him.
[17:38.28]I don't want to die here.
[17:39.64]Reload.
[17:40.92]Does his cars explode too?
[17:41.92]Is there a crouch?
[17:46.48]Look at that.
[17:48.90]Alright, so you get right when it lights up there.
[17:51.87]to the yellow.
[17:52.86]Oh, loud.
[17:57.64]Is he gonna hack you, Zach?
[18:03.48]Why would you shoot the guy holding the grenade like that?
[18:05.43]Wait, did I not see the grenade?
[18:15.13]It is the same guy you guys told me it was the same guy in a lifetime lead agent Pearson Andreasen Johnson and colding that all same guy to work into this I couldn't help feeling I'd let everyone down That little side I asked me again.
[18:30.00]Oh who got the bright idea to send in your idiot twin brother.
[18:33.70]Oh
[18:34.68]I can't remember exactly who came up with it.
[18:36.26]He broke his foot.
[18:37.18]Feeling guilty and all, I went along with the whole crazy idea to let my idiotic brother out of jail in exchange for him taking my place as an undercover agent.
[18:50.61]Alright, now we're a different guy.
[18:52.91]Yes?
[18:54.03]Tommy, listen, man.
[18:55.27]Neither of us want you to be there, but you're there.
[18:57.76]Let's just try to get along.
[18:59.06]No, let's not.
[19:00.56]Let's cut the brotherly love.
[19:01.80]Wait, what?
[19:02.24]It's cutting between us.
[19:04.89]So I get it, it's a time travel feature.
[19:07.23]Where I have a communication with myself from the past and present.
[19:10.83]I'm talking to myself in the past.
[19:14.47]With like a special ear transcoding.
[19:17.49]Alright, Greaseburger.
[19:25.49]My brain hurts.
[19:26.25]There's a lot of cutscenes.
[19:32.63]City of Los Toros.
[19:36.21]This is open world, by the way, guys.
[19:37.97]This is not just a linear experience.
[19:42.33]We can go wherever we want.
[19:43.87]We can talk to whoever we want.
[19:45.77]We can eat wherever we want.
[19:53.51]That didn't hurt me.
[19:54.05]Okay.
[19:54.65]Meet Officer Mendez at the Greaseburger.
[19:56.27]Alright, can I... It doesn't work.
[20:01.56]You know I'm trying.
[20:04.61]Okay, that's jump.
[20:07.53]Why did I get out of the car?
[20:08.55]Whose car is this?
[20:11.59]A new story mission is shown on the radar as a guy.
[20:15.35]The tutorial area is shown on the radar as a target.
[20:18.13]It's recommended that you go to the tutorial first.
[20:20.17]Okay.
[20:33.71]That was a very minor car accident.
[20:39.30]He's in the car.
[20:46.50]Are there police in this game?
[20:47.73]Yeah, there is.
[20:50.43]They didn't do anything about it.
[20:56.63]It didn't explode that time.
[21:04.66]Yeah, let's go around here.
[21:07.28]DEA, above the law.
[21:12.30]What is this guy doing?
[21:14.04]Why are these guys jumping around like frogs?
[21:17.93]What?
[21:18.75]Why is that guy dead?
[21:19.47]That guy just ran to the wall.
[21:21.35]Oh, this is DEA.
[21:26.99]Do you make, like, choices in this game?
[21:29.86]Am I getting in... That guy ran to the wall again.
[21:34.04]Watch this guy on the left.
[21:34.74]That guy on the left is not dead.
[21:44.52]Please, no.
[21:58.12]What?
[22:00.66]I don't understand.
[22:02.40]I'm very lost right now.
[22:04.62]I have no idea what's happening.
[22:10.95]Let's just go to the mission, I guess.
[22:31.26]It's not gonna explode.
[22:32.16]It's okay.
[22:32.56]Give me the health.
[22:35.70]Is there any more health up here?
[22:36.78]What is this?
[22:37.94]Collect 10 blood to permanently increase your health.
[22:40.60]Okay.
[22:40.86]Okay, let's go.
[22:49.04]Let's go to the story mission.
[22:51.98]Oh shit.
[22:58.39]It's too, it's overwhelming.
[23:00.41]It's really, yeah, I got one part of a hard capsule.
[23:05.46]Alright, go, go, go, go, go.
[23:06.82]Get me in the minivan.
[23:08.06]That's not a minivan, but you know what I'm saying.
[23:09.44]The big car.
[23:10.24]Alright, now let's just wait to outrun the police.
[23:17.41]Wait, it's right there.
[23:18.21]Where the hell is this thing?
[23:21.53]On the other side?
[23:25.59]This mini-map is freaking me out because the mini-map is not actually a mini-map.
[23:28.69]It's just a blank circle.
[23:33.57]500 points.
[23:37.18]You just picked up extra points.
[23:38.20]They'll be added to your global score.
[23:39.68]They didn't even try with that.
[23:42.74]Not even an item.
[23:43.76]It's just 500 points.
[23:46.76]Here we go.
[23:47.16]Right here.
[23:51.47]No.
[23:51.93]Never mind.
[23:53.09]On the other side.
[23:55.45]That looks like a thing I need to stand in.
[23:56.99]But what is this?
[23:59.01]Collect ten weapon coins to use two weapons at the same time.
[24:03.86]And get unlimited ammo.
[24:05.76]Okay.
[24:09.30]Use E to use.
[24:11.78]Oh, it's a save file.
[24:12.98]Okay.
[24:16.90]Could you do two rakes?
[24:19.40]Probably.
[24:22.42]Look at the roof up there.
[24:23.08]There's a thousand points up there.
[24:24.08]Alright, let's go around.
[24:27.88]Let's find a way to... Oh, inside the greaseburger.
[24:31.36]Okay.
[24:35.35]I think we should put the gun away, right?
[24:42.09]Okay, here we go.
[24:48.72]This guy having a stereo on him?
[24:50.52]What was the point of that save point?
[25:14.14]Is it a fake police car?
[25:15.18]It might be.
[25:16.04]Very big of the rat.
[25:17.28]Lady Owl in the smackdown.
[25:19.60]Yup.
[25:19.98]Is that safe?
[25:20.30]Oh.
[25:20.46]I almost just ran that guy over.
[25:22.37]Can you run people over in cutscenes?
[25:44.97]Terrible driver.
[25:45.67]Alright, make contact with Marco.
[25:49.51]Thank God the music stops playing.
[25:51.47]Otherwise this whole stream would get muted.
[25:52.99]Alright, we gotta go meet the rat.
[25:58.64]This guy's showing off.
[26:00.28]Look at how strong this guy is.
[26:01.18]He can hold onto the wall.
[26:02.86]You know how people grab the light posts and they stick their legs up vertically and they just kind of sit there?
[26:07.30]Look at that.
[26:09.17]Now that was impressive.
[26:10.07]It really was.
[26:16.89]He's just showing off.
[26:19.31]Hola, chica guapa.
[26:20.50]He's got great core.
[26:21.54]I'm looking for Marco, alias The Rat.
[26:24.18]You asshole, Cruz.
[26:25.88]Don't pretend we never met.
[26:27.62]What was that?
[26:28.38]I goddamn near lost my nose.
[26:30.90]And I like it.
[26:32.13]I like breathing through it.
[26:34.59]I don't know why I'm telling you this, but your friend, The Rat, is playing poker with Los Hermanos Vigilio inside the bar.
[26:42.17]And apparently, he's winning too much.
[26:44.86]Whoa.
[26:48.44]Watch the hair.
[26:48.90]Watch the hair.
[26:53.73]Saved him.
[26:55.05]Alright, I got a bat.
[26:58.25]Stand inside the save point and press F to save game.
[27:01.48]Uh, really?
[27:01.82]Because it's E. Right here.
[27:04.82]Global score of 500.
[27:08.90]That was very... Alright, now what?
[27:12.99]More coming?
[27:13.69]Come with me this way, mi amigo.
[27:20.52]Alright, got headshot and point blank kill times three.
[27:23.06]I don't want to lose this.
[27:24.03]Dude, that was a loco move.
[27:30.35]Sprint, tap, W, and hold.
[27:32.83]Thank God.
[27:38.35]Guy using a shield?
[27:40.37]What?
[27:43.61]The guy was holding a trash can lid.
[27:49.02]And it apparently worked.
[27:56.14]These guys aren't innocent people, right?
[28:00.27]Kill Marco.
[28:01.09]No, I'm not gonna kill... Okay, collect 10 to increase adrenaline.
[28:04.55]Here comes the copyright.
[28:06.61]We have to turn the music off.
[28:08.05]I hope you guys are ready to not hear the music anymore.
[28:17.71]Use the loco move?
[28:18.61]I don't know how to do it.
[28:22.47]Chicken just tried to kill me.
[28:27.15]The VOD is going to be deleted.
[28:28.77]Alright, move.
[28:34.51]It's tab for the loco move.
[28:36.21]Well, should I use it right now?
[28:38.01]Tab is... How do I switch between them?
[28:40.52]Because tab is the... Rewind.
[28:41.58]Saved right here.
[29:02.06]Alright, the music's gone.
[29:04.90]More people pulling up.
[29:10.16]Spicy move!
[29:10.88]That guy... Alright, we're good.
[29:18.41]It's gonna be the... I'll be his backup.
[29:23.21]Where is he?
[29:23.55]Where are the bad guys?
[29:24.99]This way?
[29:26.89]Spicy move!
[29:29.93]Oh shit!
[29:30.33]Oh my god!
[29:30.71]Get out!
[29:30.95]Get out of the way!
[29:37.49]Alright, I got a loco move.
[29:39.31]Oh, wait, wait.
[29:39.81]Don't get killed.
[29:40.31]I gotta get this thing.
[29:43.09]Oh, that's a good guy.
[29:47.60]Never mind.
[29:50.24]I got a combo going.
[29:53.86]No, no more music.
[29:54.92]No more copyright music.
[29:56.51]Don't make me turn it off.
[29:57.45]They're gonna make me turn it off.
[30:04.32]No, that just pretended.
[30:05.38]Like, what is this weird, like, candy cane parking garage?
[30:11.48]Spicy move!
[30:14.21]Okay.
[30:18.23]Why are there people?
[30:19.01]Why are there, like... So much for Mexican hospitality.
[30:21.81]Oh, God.
[30:22.45]Alright, let's go.
[30:28.52]I'm just gonna go ahead of him.
[30:33.71]Oh, I can't.
[30:34.77]Just get up.
[30:36.73]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[30:37.35]This is a very long mission.
[30:38.33]I don't want this to be over with.
[30:40.57]I want this to be over with.
[30:44.85]What?
[30:45.47]That exploded, that guy.
[30:49.74]Oh, my God.
[30:52.68]They blow up if they're too close.
[30:58.14]There's a lot of, like, shorter people, huh?
[31:07.38]Forklift?
[31:07.82]I think we're getting here.
[31:11.44]Easy, amigo.
[31:12.42]You drive.
[31:13.58]I got too many tequilas on me.
[31:15.08]Driving to the junkyard.
[31:23.97]Oh, shit.
[31:24.45]No.
[31:25.11]Turn.
[31:26.11]This way.
[31:26.63]Exit.
[31:26.87]You gotta... I always get stuck in the ceiling.
[31:30.69]Turn around.
[31:37.63]Wait, what?
[31:40.53]Why can I not go down from here?
[31:45.09]Have I lost my mind, or was there nowhere to go down?
[31:49.81]Oh, we got the jump!
[31:50.94]Are you serious?
[32:09.53]what a great what a great hold on Cruz so just to recap your crazy brother is on the loose somewhere out there where he's running about like a lunatic and if that isn't bad enough he's working for us insane I know what you're saying sir but if you'll just let me finish the story best try and look past the details and see the big details we're talking about endangering the lives of innocent people
[32:36.79]They had to pitch his voice up because it's so deep.
[32:40.43]Okay, amigo.
[32:41.45]What I'm gonna do now is go inside, take my enchilada hangover cure, and get my hair back into maximum padrísimo position.
[32:49.95]And what about presenting me to your boss?
[32:52.92]Oh, si, si.
[32:54.08]I nearly forget.
[32:55.42]Okay, si.
[32:56.59]Of course I can call the jefecito and say a few nice words, but this won't be enough, gringo.
[33:01.69]You need to get yourself noticed.
[33:04.09]Mission score.
[33:04.79]Alright.
[33:05.99]Didn't use any rewinds.
[33:10.90]My global score.
[33:11.64]I gotta compete globally.
[33:13.54]There are a hundred of those.
[33:16.52]Best move overall.
[33:17.74]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:18.34]Let's go.
[33:23.75]Save successfully.
[33:25.85]Alright, now we get the open world again.
[33:26.97]Is that him?
[33:31.03]Should I take his truck?
[33:32.53]No, we need a... I want my own car.
[33:36.09]New challenge missions are shown on the radar as you are.
[33:38.53]Complete challenge missions to unlock the next story mission.
[33:42.53]A radar with a power plant attached means that your mission is in another area of the city.
[33:48.43]You can choose the mission directly if you want.
[33:51.77]That's kind of cheating, don't you think?
[33:54.18]Well, that's how you switch.
[33:54.92]It's Q and E. I'm number one globally for total overdose.
[34:03.21]Good.
[34:05.13]That gives me something to look forward to.
[34:06.11]Alright, let's take a car.
[34:07.99]Uh, no, that's cheating.
[34:08.73]I'm not gonna cheat.
[34:11.81]Let's get out of the junkyard, though.
[34:12.93]I don't know if this is getting us out of the junkyard or further in to the junkyard.
[34:20.82]Well, there's 500 points.
[34:25.50]I don't think I'm going the right way.
[34:27.60]It's a maze.
[34:30.97]There we go.
[34:31.45]Finally.
[34:31.79]Alright.
[34:36.19]What are the points for?
[34:37.29]For your global score.
[34:42.52]Oops.
[34:42.84]Alright.
[34:43.34]I think I can still get up there.
[34:49.12]Fuck.
[34:49.46]Come on.
[34:57.70]I can't.
[34:59.24]I can't get that.
[34:59.96]I can't get the 500 points.
[35:06.57]They stay in the car.
[35:07.59]They all stay in the car.
[35:10.23]Why?
[35:12.19]It's not like in GTA where they freak out and jump out too.
[35:14.53]There's a jump right here.
[35:16.13]We have to go off this.
[35:18.87]Me and my new best friend are going to go off the jump.
[35:22.58]Who cares about the mission?
[35:28.15]straight ahead let's go congrats on the 500 hey thanks man you scored 7 500 points and won five things
[35:57.11]All it took was the expense of some guy's life.
[36:00.17]Alright, give me those points.
[36:05.63]Is it fall damage?
[36:06.27]Yeah, there is.
[36:07.93]Alright, here we go.
[36:09.07]Side mission.
[36:12.43]Dope dealers must die.
[36:13.69]Some newcomers in town think they can deal dope on my turf.
[36:16.21]They can try to think again.
[36:17.75]Alright.
[36:19.15]Kill them.
[36:19.67]You need to score at least 700 points to complete the challenge.
[36:21.72]So go get everybody.
[36:24.86]This is how you use V-Bucks.
[36:28.45]No.
[36:29.03]This is a Fortnite-free stream.
[36:32.29]You know that, right?
[36:33.43]Come on.
[36:35.23]Any Fortnite references are an immediate 62-hour suspension.
[36:46.00]Okay, let's go.
[36:49.28]Let's use the super move.
[36:56.19]I want to use this move.
[37:01.02]No, stop rewinding.
[37:03.97]I want to use the Loco move.
[37:06.39]I don't want to do this.
[37:25.75]Streamer is kind and rewinds.
[37:31.95]Extra health.
[37:33.69]That guy's just running around in a circle.
[37:35.71]Can I get in this car?
[37:36.74]Good.
[37:38.80]Spicy move!
[37:40.38]That was a nice dodge.
[37:42.74]Wasn't enough to save him, though.
[37:44.30]Yes, it was.
[37:52.87]They're on the roof.
[37:53.87]Let's go to the roof.
[37:58.69]How far back does the rewind go?
[38:00.31]Is that a grenade?
[38:04.68]Oh, shit!
[38:09.62]Spicy move!
[38:12.64]You're gonna fire?
[38:13.34]Yeah, this guy... Spicy move!
[38:18.51]Does he have to say that after every time I shoot somebody?
[38:20.57]Alright, hunting rifle.
[38:23.23]There's a guy back here I'm gonna pick off.
[38:26.47]Actually, I can't.
[38:31.83]700 points, right?
[38:33.31]Got 900?
[38:36.31]Spicy move!
[38:38.03]I'm about to turn off in-game dialogue.
[38:42.01]We're going to hear that a thousand times.
[38:43.33]Yeah, you won.
[38:46.39]Congratulations.
[38:50.66]Continue.
[38:52.78]Almost to time.
[38:53.58]Turn off dialogue and music.
[38:56.92]I'm about to.
[38:57.62]I'm about to do it.
[39:00.84]New weapon skill.
[39:01.56]Dual handguns.
[39:02.28]You can use twin handguns to target two enemies at the same time.
[39:07.07]Okay.
[39:07.96]How do I do that?
[39:09.66]New store mission is open.
[39:10.56]It's on the radar as Guy.
[39:11.80]Okay.
[39:16.99]Why is this... Why does this guy dress like this?
[39:50.38]Is he dead?
[39:50.86]Why did he flop over here and die?
[39:54.88]He was fine.
[39:59.02]Okay, he's dead.
[40:00.32]I didn't do anything.
[40:03.38]I just observed.
[40:04.13]That's all I did.
[40:04.77]Alright, I need a... Can I get in a taxi?
[40:17.81]Yes, you can.
[40:18.87]Okay.
[40:19.77]Take me to... No, I ain't paying for this.
[40:26.01]No, I don't wanna pay for this.
[40:27.19]I wanna take the taxi.
[40:31.86]No, I wanna... Okay, there we go.
[40:36.32]No, I wanna get out of the taxi.
[40:50.84]It's free?
[40:53.56]What do you mean it's free?
[41:01.05]That guy really did a great job of getting away.
[41:04.41]There's so many jumps.
[41:05.43]Why are there this many ramps?
[41:08.22]I don't understand why there's this many ramps.
[41:11.40]What is that for?
[41:12.48]Health upgrade because I went off a jump?
[41:19.97]Alright, there's a jump and then a jump.
[41:23.49]Hold on a second.
[41:25.41]Why is there a jump jump?
[41:30.10]There's another one.
[41:38.02]I did it.
[41:38.32]Alright, let's go.
[41:40.60]19,400 points.
[41:40.79]That's not bad.
[41:48.20]Any more jump jumps down here?
[41:49.64]Points.
[41:49.98]I don't even know why I'm collecting these.
[41:56.30]Do they have to be in slow motion?
[41:57.70]Apparently they do.
[42:01.77]Is this game better than GTA 5?
[42:04.79]Uh, yeah.
[42:06.15]I think, yeah, I think so.
[42:13.71]I can get up this.
[42:17.48]He's telling me I can't get up that.
[42:23.20]Come on.
[42:24.06]Why?
[42:25.54]What's wrong with the guy?
[42:27.20]That guy's like hurt.
[42:27.88]Hold on.
[42:29.10]I need to investigate this.
[42:35.27]I'm gonna hit you.
[42:40.83]I'm gonna hit you.
[42:43.39]What happened to you?
[42:48.67]Whoa, hold on a second.
[42:50.87]Hold on.
[42:58.32]Whatever.
[42:59.90]I caught his hat on my head.
[43:04.31]That's a thing?
[43:04.97]Okay, that's kind of cool.
[43:17.64]Why is this game so amazing?
[43:19.56]No, the hat!
[43:20.34]Wait!
[43:21.71]No!
[43:22.37]What?
[43:22.57]Because I went in a car and my hat fell off?
[43:24.49]That's not cool.
[43:34.19]If you just didn't dive, you would be fine.
[43:36.72]Alright, let's get over to the mission.
[43:39.72]Wherever it is.
[43:40.36]Over there?
[43:45.17]Search the city for secrets, do cool car stunts, explore the roofs, find extra weapons and health, or simply take a relaxing break from the world of gunplay.
[43:53.42]Okay, choose mission.
[43:55.44]Smash, let's just go.
[43:57.06]Click it, I'm ready.
[44:01.54]Take a relaxing break driving over people.
[44:10.46]So this is the man I keep hearing about, huh?
[44:14.28]I would shake your hand, but mine is covered in blood.
[44:18.14]I'm a vegetarian.
[44:21.46]The funny Americano.
[44:24.21]Is he a vegetarian?
[44:24.91]Us Mexicano boys are not impressed with talk, only action.
[44:30.75]No, he didn't.
[44:31.15]He licked his finger.
[44:32.27]You really want to prove yourself to me?
[44:34.73]I guess.
[44:35.67]I got nothing better to do.
[44:38.38]You see, Gringo, to a Mexicano, honor is everything.
[44:43.70]Now I hear about the Virgilios coming into town from their farms, cheating at cards, behaving like beasts.
[44:52.15]I need to restore my honor.
[44:54.57]So I got a job for you.
[44:58.41]Shoot.
[44:59.59]The eagles.
[45:00.03]My beautiful chauffeur angel will drop you off at the farm where you have two goals.
[45:06.96]First, you will need to smash the fertilizer container and destroy everything you can.
[45:13.18]I'm really good at smashing.
[45:15.14]Steal the Virgilio's beloved car and bring it back to me.
[45:19.59]Okay.
[45:20.71]Comprendes?
[45:23.87]I'm ready to do it.
[45:26.31]Go to the Virgilio's farm.
[45:29.13]Straight ahead.
[45:31.85]Oh, by the way.
[45:32.29]Did you know that I can do this?
[45:33.91]You better get some wheels, bro.
[45:35.57]It's quite a walk.
[45:40.19]Get some wheels.
[45:42.77]I want that head.
[45:43.61]Give me that helmet.
[45:44.21]That guy has a pod on his head.
[45:47.73]Is this playing in reverse?
[45:53.03]No, okay.
[45:53.59]I thought the music was playing in reverse.
[45:55.85]Alright, I need a... It's playing polka music.
[46:00.37]Alright, I... I need a car.
[46:13.61]Alright, let's go.

[46:25.38]Give me one of your cars.
[46:26.36]No, +2.
[46:28.89]That was a good joke.
[46:41.80]Why am I walking this?
[46:42.96]Why should I be driving this?
[46:47.32]Oh, I'm in so much trouble now.
[46:50.52]What?
[46:53.57]What the fuck just happened?
[46:55.19]Did I just do a super jump over the mountain?
[47:04.71]I just jumped over the mountain.
[47:10.14]I didn't even get a car.
[47:11.22]There's no broken down cars here that I can take.
[47:13.16]There we go.
[47:19.21]Alright, I gotta destroy that thing.
[47:22.83]I gotta destroy that thing.
[47:23.71]That really hungry, really low energy, really not having a good time Sims container.
[47:28.33]I'll take care of it.
[47:30.10]I can shoot people with two bullets a- You can't destroy the fertilizer tower right away.
[47:33.52]Try to ram or blow up the four steel containers.
[47:38.89]Ooh, got it.
[47:39.39]Alright.
[47:45.25]Get both containers.
[47:46.53]Explode them both, please.
[47:48.02]What the fuck is this chicken doing?
[47:53.62]Ooh, heavy handgun.
[47:54.74]Let's try it.
[47:55.28]There's chickens everywhere.
[48:00.40]Alright, hold on.
[48:03.08]I'm gonna say I'm gonna ram it.
[48:05.68]And drive right into it.
[48:06.94]No, I'm not going to take the soil tiller.
[48:08.64]I'm going to go with the one on the left first.
[48:15.56]Which is all the way over here.
[48:16.34]I don't know where I'm going.
[48:17.06]Can I break through this?
[48:19.16]No.
[48:22.40]Is the stream randomly freezing for anybody else?
[48:25.69]Um... It says I have no drop frames.
[48:29.43]I don't know why that's happening.
[48:34.78]Sorry that's happening.
[48:35.51]Maybe it's like a Twitch connection issue thing?
[48:38.83]Spicy move!
[48:40.23]Can I shoot out the window?
[48:45.91]Okay.
[48:46.57]Now I just have to drive into this.
[48:52.22]Spicy move!
[48:54.80]My mic is too low?
[48:57.62]The game might just be too loud.
[49:00.15]Wait!
[49:00.31]Didn't do it.
[49:08.01]Spicy moves!
[49:13.33]Now I can line it up.
[49:19.25]There we go.
[49:19.77]One, two, three, exit.
[49:28.48]It's taking up the entire grid.
[49:36.60]I won.
[49:37.46]Oh, fuck.
[49:37.80]The steel constructions are pretty tough.
[49:40.00]You've got to get your hands on some heavy-duty vehicles or use some explosives for the next three.
[49:45.72]I'll be back.
[49:47.20]Oh, Jesus.
[49:47.72]This isn't a movie, you know.
[49:49.99]It kind of feels like one.
[49:51.25]Alright, I've got to blow up.
[49:52.15]This is a heavy-duty explosive gasoline car.
[49:54.35]You got it.
[49:54.69]Okay, we're going to drive this.
[50:01.73]How many rewinds do I have?
[50:02.79]Do I have enough?
[50:03.23]Alright, this has got to come down.
[50:04.43]This has got to come down.
[50:08.48]Hold on one second.
[50:09.34]Give me a moment.
[50:10.58]This just got cut down.
[50:16.64]Big bits, too.
[50:18.76]Hold on.
[50:21.16]Let me just drop the volume on here.
[50:23.56]It's a little too loud for me.
[50:27.81]That should be fine.
[50:29.75]This can come up like that.
[50:31.13]Alright.
[50:32.39]Big bits we have.
[50:33.41]Yes, we do.
[50:34.75]Cad, BTV, thank you for the $50 donation.

[51:05.75]Anyways, let's keep going.
[51:10.20]Move this up here.
[51:13.32]And now I should be able to see.
[51:14.18]Alright, let's go.
[51:16.10]Let's see if that made a difference.
[51:21.08]That's a little bit better, I think.
[51:22.32]Yeah, I can hear myself think again.
[51:24.00]Alright, these are the next ones up this way.
[51:27.36]He said you're going to need some more spicy stuff to explode these ones.
[51:32.04]So you got it.
[51:33.70]Check this out.
[51:39.27]Do it.
[51:42.16]and the whole, the wick is going to start burning and the firework is going to go, yep, there it is.
[51:45.66]Dude, I can't believe that we tied like ten firecracker bricks together.
[51:52.28]Whoa, look out!
[51:52.82]I really shouldn't be encouraging this behavior, but you still have two to go.
[52:00.25]Extra help.
[52:06.67]You're pig food now.
[52:09.08]At last you have a purpose.
[52:11.56]This music.
[52:13.15]That like... That's like the slap bass.
[52:19.19]Alright, I need another car.
[52:27.79]That's Labo music.
[52:28.99]This is another one of those.
[52:34.88]I need it.
[52:40.46]Seinfeld.
[52:41.14]Hardcore Seinfeld theme.
[52:44.38]No, just because something has like a... Doesn't mean it's... I mean, it kind of does.
[52:47.78]You're right.
[52:48.08]You've earned 25,000 points and won five gun moves.
[53:02.94]No, he don't have him blow this up.
[53:04.16]I gotta get this all the way over here.
[53:06.94]Without it exploding.
[53:08.19]Absolutely don't.
[53:09.03]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:10.63]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[53:13.07]Open the door.
[53:13.85]Back it up.
[53:19.98]Shit.
[53:20.32]Oh, no, there's no, I don't have any more.
[53:23.36]Ugh.
[53:32.49]It's left control for the loco moves.
[53:34.51]Alright.
[53:35.99]God damn it.
[53:42.87]Oh, fuck.
[53:43.83]This is going to be so sucky.
[53:45.67]Alright, we're fine.
[53:47.44]The loco moves are controlled.
[53:48.90]Give me a car.
[53:49.64]Why would you say that and then drive away?
[54:02.23]I hear this shit again.
[54:03.05]I need a car.
[54:07.75]I don't wanna do this.
[54:14.93]Just blow the fucking gas station up again.
[54:16.77]That didn't even hit anyone.
[54:21.71]Why are there this many people here now?
[54:23.24]There wasn't this many people here before.
[54:31.47]Okay.
[54:31.91]Is there a car in this garage?
[54:37.52]No cars.
[54:38.22]Thankfully there is.
[54:38.96]I'm going to take the big boy.
[54:48.20]Just jump over the mountain again.
[54:50.63]That's not reliable.
[54:51.35]That's not a reliable form of transportation.
[54:53.67]I'm going to take the car.
[55:04.95]I'm trying to... Yes, I am trying to skip this part.
[55:08.15]I am.
[55:17.14]Alright, let's go.
[55:19.04]Bring on the polka music.
[55:22.80]I wonder if we'll see the groundhog!
[55:24.34]Use me.
[55:27.62]Mhm.
[55:38.57]No, alright.
[55:39.09]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[55:40.15]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out!
[55:52.68]We've already seen this.
[55:53.44]We can skip it.
[55:54.02]I didn't even do anything.
[55:56.82]Pfft.
[56:08.82]I hate them.
[56:15.62]Who else is here?
[56:16.37]You're making my life a living hell.
[56:26.15]Alright, let's be very easy here.
[56:28.37]Let's take this thing, and I'm going to be ready to not die.
[56:32.10]Oh my god, why are you here?
[56:38.34]Alright, it's this one right here, right?
[56:41.14]Sayonara.
[56:41.96]Wait, no, this one I just... Ah!
[56:43.32]This one I just blew up.
[56:46.14]Why is there a health in this shitter?
[56:48.18]I just called it the shitter.
[56:57.47]Give me some credit for that one.
[56:58.37]I'll take it.
[56:58.75]That shit was absolutely incredible.
[57:06.31]It was so unnecessary, but I'll take it.
[57:11.34]Alright, we got full ammo with this thing.
[57:16.15]Round here, same deal.
[57:18.01]This one.
[57:20.39]Fucking idiot.
[57:22.43]Get out quick before it explodes!
[57:23.83]Please don't hit me.
[57:24.49]Alright, we're good.
[57:27.65]That one takes out that.

[57:46.01]Alright up this way I need to grab I'll grab the lawnmower this time Try go okay target dummies.
[58:09.07]I need to practice my rotation.
[58:10.15]Oh
[58:11.30]So if I start with the dot, and then the dot is consumed, and I use the fill move, I have to proc a couple of crits though before I can use the finishing move that I have.
[58:20.14]It's weird though.
[58:31.27]Oh, come on!
[58:32.81]Like, none of you have ever played a goddamn finishing move before, and a raid video game before.
[58:38.88]Wait, what is that?
[58:45.44]I think I have like a psycho time now.
[58:50.15]I don't know what that did.
[58:52.69]We aren't nerds like you.

[60:03.41]I'm wasting these.
[60:04.81]Why did he do that again?
[60:05.85]Don't, no, don't.
[60:08.77]They're gone.
[60:09.35]I don't have any more.
[60:16.18]Why would you jump off?
[60:18.82]To try to kill me.
[60:21.80]I just read Twitch.

[61:12.34]Spicy move.
[61:20.21]Get me in this fucking car.
[61:21.33]I've got extra health.
[61:31.95]Cars can't fit down here, and it's aggravating.
[61:33.79]Just get out.
[61:37.48]So here we go, down here.
[61:42.32]Hunting rifle's the best weapon, for sure.
[61:44.32]Without a single little doubt.
[61:47.54]Zipline up there.
[61:51.27]This is one of your favorite games ever made?
[61:53.76]Seems pretty fun.
[61:55.56]Hydrate, sure.
[62:15.47]The fence shouldn't have been able to protect him there.
[62:18.19]That was utter dog shit.
[62:19.37]I hit him...
[62:42.03]God fucking damn it, man.
[62:46.05]Rewinds.
[62:46.93]That's what I deserve.
[62:48.99]That's what I fucking deserve for wasting my rewinds.
[62:51.33]I'm not going to make a stupid joke and waste the rewinds now.
[62:53.89]Oh my god, I have to do this polka music shit again.
[62:59.65]I'm playing it for real.
[63:31.48]What even blew me up?
[63:32.32]I don't even understand.
[63:32.96]Did we throw a grenade?
[63:33.72]Is that what happened?
[63:34.37]How does that make any sense?
[63:45.90]That's aim assist.

[64:36.94]You can't destroy the fertilizer tower right away.
[64:39.70]Try to ram or blow up the four steel containers.
[64:42.62]These things are terrible.
[64:43.56]These things don't do anything.
[64:44.74]That guy got way too close.
[64:47.27]Alright, let's go.
[64:52.83]No more of this.
[64:53.49]You know what's really funny?
[64:58.84]I saw somebody in the chat say that this was gonna take a really long time, this mission.
[65:03.38]Now I understand why.
[65:06.02]No, I get it.
[65:08.68]Alright, go for the one on the left here first.
[65:18.19]Don't waste rewinds on anything stupid here.
[65:24.71]Can you manually save?
[65:26.26]You cannot.
[65:26.66]There's the first one.
[65:32.08]Good.
[65:32.52]Got it.
[65:33.16]Exploded.
[65:40.80]You've got to get your hands on some heavy-duty vehicles, or use some explosives for the next three.
[65:46.36]I'll be back.
[65:47.84]Oh, Jesus.
[65:49.28]This isn't a movie, you know.
[65:50.60]It kind of feels like one.
[65:52.22]Good to hear that again, at least.
[65:53.72]Any special treats in here?
[65:54.96]Yes, there is.
[65:57.08]Bathtub?
[65:57.94]Nothing.
[65:58.84]Just a random asset.
[66:00.98]Okay, let's go.
[66:12.61]Still have both of our rewinders.
[66:21.46]Turn this way.
[66:23.99]Turn this way.
[66:25.71]Straight ahead.
[66:26.25]Blow it up.
[66:29.73]Easy with the skid.
[66:30.35]Easy with the skid.
[66:31.07]Get out, please.
[66:32.88]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[66:33.92]Come on.
[66:35.64]Good.
[66:42.75]You still have two to go.
[66:46.45]At least we get to hear this again.
[66:57.70]Sour, please.
[67:01.28]Sour, please.
[67:02.34]Alright, let's go.
[67:06.36]We got the only two that are left.
[67:08.59]I still have to use one of these moves to try for the first time ever.
[67:13.74]Okay, straight ahead.
[67:18.36]Got another car.
[67:22.04]I don't think... Wait, I might be able to... Can I do it from here?
[67:36.98]I didn't even do anything.
[67:38.54]That just caused me more problems.
[67:42.61]How was I gonna aim like that?
[68:00.79]Safe point.
[68:07.85]Okay, global score.
[68:08.57]Got more global score.
[68:10.54]Extra health.
[68:11.10]Safe point.
[68:11.90]Finally.
[68:12.50]We can be done with this shit.
[68:16.64]Save it here.
[68:17.06]Right there.
[68:17.84]Bingo.
[68:19.68]Watch out for the barrels.
[68:20.84]I know what I'm doing.
[68:24.12]Don't worry.
[68:24.48]Don't worry about me.
[68:27.14]Dynamite.
[68:29.02]That should be enough to blow up the tanks.
[68:35.47]That's pretty spicy.
[68:37.13]Wow.
[68:37.53]Somebody's shooting me from behind.
[68:42.90]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[68:48.26]He knows what he's doing.
[68:49.42]I do.
[68:49.66]I know what I'm doing.
[69:07.87]It's not useful.
[69:09.61]It looks like it could be, but it's not.
[69:13.82]Need more health?
[69:16.40]Okay, here we go.
[69:17.32]Dynamite.
[69:17.78]How does it work?
[69:19.04]Can I just throw it, or do I have to time it?
[69:20.40]I don't understand.
[69:25.77]That's a long fuse.
[69:36.73]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[69:45.11]Oh god, I gotta go.
[69:47.27]I gotta get out of here.
[69:49.08]Alright, I thought that that chicken was like a Pokémon.
[69:59.30]Hey, by the way, the song keeps upgrading.
[70:01.94]We're getting lyrics now.
[70:06.81]He's causing a problem, you all know it.
[70:13.15]I'm gonna go this way.
[70:17.03]Get the zip tower.
[70:25.07]I really am gonna have to turn the music off, aren't I?
[70:29.53]This is a great Korn song.
[70:32.23]It's not Korn.
[70:34.82]This is not Korn.
[70:42.96]I need to find a way out of here.
[70:44.52]Get me to the next section.
[70:50.48]Hold on.
[70:50.78]There's something up here.
[70:58.08]You made this song nice, man.
[71:02.24]That's pretty... Can I trip?
[71:10.46]Nice, dude.
[71:11.92]Nice song, man.
[71:12.90]You did a good job.
[71:16.42]Okay, so... I can't get in there through there, can I?
[71:21.72]I gotta zipline through there.
[71:22.66]Alright, so, hold on.
[71:24.08]Let me just get, like, a good shot.
[71:27.08]So, we gotta go... all the way left and all the way around.
[71:32.65]So, I gotta go left, left, left.
[71:40.11]I feel like that's gonna hurt me one of these days.
[71:46.90]Go around?
[71:47.38]I can't go around.
[71:47.96]The gate doesn't open.
[71:49.79]The gate cannot open.
[71:50.65]It's impossible to open it, so I have to slide down here with the zipline.
[71:56.24]I've got to go all the way around here.
[72:02.96]And then I should be able to take a right.
[72:07.62]Back into here.
[72:08.32]I'm going to save it, actually.
[72:10.91]I don't want to do this shit again.
[72:13.57]Save it.
[72:18.78]Why are they growing all the corn in the shade?
[72:22.68]That's a great question.
[72:27.49]Who made this game?
[72:29.13]I did.
[72:29.65]Me, I did.
[72:30.21]I made this.
[72:30.73]No, but, like, who actually did?
[72:31.97]Like, for real.
[72:36.44]Alright, good dynamite.
[72:39.58]Full dynamite?
[72:40.68]Yep.
[72:45.32]The box would not protect you there.
[72:46.84]Alright, so.
[72:48.34]We are looking at where we need to be here.
[72:50.14]I need, like, a map of Disney World.
[72:53.72]No, it's this way.
[72:54.30]I don't know what the hell that guy was doing.
[73:02.23]Alright, where's my Disney World map?
[73:05.77]It's over here.
[73:06.49]But I'm trying to think of the... I'm trying to find the way to, like, go around correctly.
[73:11.76]Got it.
[73:14.76]What are you...
[73:21.96]So now I should be able to go over there.
[73:23.28]Remember this?
[73:30.61]He's still here.
[73:32.05]We can make the joke one more time.
[73:33.95]Ready?
[73:37.43]Get ready to laugh.
[73:38.23]I want to see... I can't wait to see a lot of laughs.
[73:53.94]Yeah, I figured he might have just fallen off on his own, but he didn't.
[74:00.14]You can hold your laughs for now.
[74:04.77]Yeah, hold on to those laughs.
[74:06.31]You're gonna need them later, trust me.
[74:08.43]Alright, let's do it.
[74:12.37]Final one.
[74:13.09]I got dynamite.
[74:22.54]Bird on a wire.
[74:23.80]Nice.
[74:27.96]So where was the explosion then?
[74:29.39]Who threw like a grenade?
[74:30.47]There's nobody here.
[74:31.37]It was that guy.
[74:35.05]Okay.
[74:35.97]Save it right here.
[74:40.61]Use the loco move?
[74:41.37]I'm saving him.
[74:42.33]It's like in Dark Souls when you don't crush the little crunch things and you keep them until the end of the game because you have to because you can't help it.
[74:54.24]I'm gonna die.
[74:57.18]Can you laugh yet?
[74:57.78]No.
[74:58.33]Not yet.
[74:58.81]Don't do it.
[75:00.15]There's nothing to laugh at here.
[75:02.19]I'm just, like, playing the game, right?
[75:04.23]You'll know when there's something to laugh at because, oh boy, everyone will be doing it too.
[75:13.12]I'll give you a cue when it's time to laugh.
[75:15.28]You'll know.
[75:23.17]Will you tell us when you laugh?
[75:24.41]Yeah, I'll let you know.
[75:26.11]Make sure you guys are prepared for it.
[75:27.21]Is it going to blow up?
[75:35.05]I'll make sure this is going to work.
[75:36.57]Okay, yeah, one more and that's it.
[75:37.97]Mission complete.
[75:39.61]Thank you all for playing.
[75:41.71]That'll be the end of this one.
[75:46.68]Ooh, get the body armor.
[75:47.86]I don't even need it.
[75:48.36]I'm done.
[75:56.01]No, don't laugh yet.
[75:56.73]There's nothing to laugh at yet.
[76:01.19]Trust me.
[76:01.65]Just use my guidance, please.
[76:05.64]I'll let you know.
[76:10.58]That guy is standing in the back.
[76:13.16]Look at the guy in the passenger seat here.
[76:17.74]He's standing up in the car.
[76:20.13]He just was.
[76:36.45]No, rewind it!
[76:38.20]Oh, no!
[76:38.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[76:40.34]There's... Okay, you can laugh!
[76:44.10]You can laugh!
[76:51.23]I gotta save it here.
[76:57.69]The music cuts.
[77:00.24]Somebody hold their finger down on the radio station.
[77:03.48]Not a radio, the turntable, the disc, the radio block, the thing that spins, the circle record player.
[77:09.42]That one.
[77:09.92]Nah, I'm taking this car.
[77:13.99]This car is locked.
[77:23.53]That guy's smart, he locked his car.
[77:33.00]He's gonna do, like, cartwheels around this guy's car.
[77:37.19]Wait, hold on.
[77:38.21]I can't... His car's unlocked!
[77:40.07]I can reach it and unlock it!
[77:41.33]I want to do the kickflip thing.
[77:50.17]Spicy move!
[77:52.11]Okay.
[77:52.94]Now I can drive it.
[77:56.72]I gotta get one more of these.
[77:58.00]So it's all the way down there.
[78:00.48]More of this maze bullshit.
[78:02.06]Okay, let's go here.
[78:03.10]I have five rewinds.
[78:07.67]I should be fine from here on out.
[78:14.05]I need a spicy emote.
[78:18.73]No, we don't need a spicy emote.
[78:23.14]No.
[78:23.44]Not everything has to be an emote.
[78:25.24]We don't need a spicy emote.
[78:33.01]Alright, up there.
[78:34.61]I gotta make this count.
[78:37.07]Yeah, we already have a spicy emote.
[78:42.87]Boom.
[78:45.41]But that wasn't a spicy move.
[78:46.42]That was a Maximo Coolio move.
[78:49.50]It's a difference, guys.
[78:50.44]Don't you know?
[78:55.66]God damn it.
[78:56.36]That was lucky.
[79:02.63]What's the point of shooting if I can't even shoot this?
[79:06.15]I was shooting that out of my shoe.
[79:07.61]That was coming out of the bottom of my shoe.
[79:21.10]Bayonetta.
[79:21.64]Does Bayonetta do stuff like that?
[79:28.33]Is that a good game?
[79:35.09]No.
[79:38.06]You don't think it's a good game?
[79:38.94]Alright, loco move.
[79:46.81]Alright.
[79:47.37]I don't understand.
[79:47.91]I don't know what just happened.
[79:48.71]All I know is I just pulled out a fucking Mario Kart item.
[79:52.26]And then the game exploded on me.
[79:53.90]So let's try that again.
[79:55.84]On the next guy.
[79:57.04]On the next guy.
[79:58.14]Shoot him, please.
[79:59.02]What am I using?
[79:59.44]No.
[79:59.50]Um...
[80:18.62]I did it.
[80:18.94]I just did the arty!
[80:24.78]The strongest man in the world.
[80:28.64]He used to do that on Pete and Pete.
[80:29.98]He would move houses and shit.
[80:32.70]By like two inches.
[80:36.26]Yes, I've made an arty reference before, but it's one of the best characters to ever be in modern television.
[80:47.63]Whoa!
[80:50.27]Take the key.
[80:51.65]Alright, let's try the Mario Kart thing.
[80:54.89]Alright, ready?
[80:55.57]Here we go.
[80:55.95]You guys ready?
[80:58.97]What is this?
[80:59.43]I don't understand.
[81:00.33]What the fuck is that?
[81:19.63]What are the other ones here?
[81:20.53]Golden gun.
[81:22.49]Golden gun.
[81:29.49]Okay.
[81:30.11]That was kind of cool.
[81:30.99]Let's do it.
[81:31.45]Golden gun.
[81:32.97]What's this one?
[81:37.99]Oh, shit.
[81:38.29]Watch out.
[81:38.61]Where is it?
[81:56.41]Hold on, the chicken wasn't... What the fuck?
[81:59.22]Hey!
[81:59.52]The chicken wasn't even impressed with that.
[82:03.70]Why did it tuck in the chicken?
[82:07.92]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[82:16.64]Why is it putting people in the house?
[82:24.50]Okay, I need to take a second here.
[82:27.72]Why is it targeting the chickens and then they just don't care?
[82:31.38]Alright, I gotta take the key.
[82:38.13]Holy shit, what kind of weird superhero shit is that?
[82:43.03]It can go into the building and climb the stairs.
[82:48.75]The door is locked, so climb the fucking window.
[82:52.35]Get in the window, it's open.
[83:04.85]Damn it, man.
[83:13.13]I don't got many more of these.
[83:14.95]Actually, I got five of them.
[83:15.81]Never mind.
[83:16.21]I got plenty.
[83:22.57]Can't shoot through a fucking fence.
[83:30.85]No, why you... Stop!
[83:32.25]Why would you target the chicken?
[83:52.19]the wall god damn it stop it I'm just gonna walk around the fucking building we're going around the building oh look at that they're both dead you're worse than trailer trash your tractor trash
[84:20.41]Oh, what are they doing in here?
[84:21.37]Can I use that weapon?
[84:25.49]Some old grandma just attacked me.
[84:32.92]Be careful in here.
[84:33.68]There's a guy right here.
[84:34.42]I'm going to go with machete.
[84:42.80]Who the hell is this person?
[84:45.59]Oh, it's you.
[84:49.82]He just took the health.
[84:52.67]They can take the health.
[84:53.91]That's interesting.
[85:00.01]Okay, up the stairs.
[85:06.01]This is going to be a boss fight.
[85:07.13]I definitely need to save this.
[85:09.53]You took it?
[85:10.17]Did I?
[85:12.25]Ah, you took it.
[85:13.05]Okay.
[85:14.95]Come on!
[85:18.15]Alright, into the balding, and then excuse me!
[85:21.51]Everybody be cool, this is a robbery.
[85:24.75]Just shut up.
[85:26.35]Just give me the car keys and no one gets hurt.
[85:29.35]Okay, I guess not.
[85:32.41]So much for Mexican hospitality.
[85:37.60]Hey, if you marry your sister, are you your own kid's uncle?
[85:48.57]Okay.
[85:48.93]Golden gun.
[85:50.13]Hey, if you marry your sister, are you your own kid's uncle?
[85:52.93]I just took a bunch of screenshots of this guy.
[85:56.79]Golden gun.
[86:02.05]Hey, asshole.
[86:03.17]You should have stayed home on your tractor.
[86:07.09]What am I doing?
[86:09.47]Spicy move.
[86:10.25]I've ate him.
[86:11.11]I think I won.
[86:13.33]You smelled bad even before you died.
[86:18.29]Wait, is people cheering for me?
[86:20.69]Oh, okay.
[86:25.91]Good thing I took a bunch of pictures of that guy.
[86:27.35]Alright, grab the key.
[86:30.57]It's on his person.
[86:32.23]Got the key.
[86:33.47]Deliver the car to Caesar.
[86:40.11]Where's that car?
[86:40.86]Hey, where's that car?
[86:45.01]Oh, gotta get the car.
[86:49.68]Where'd you get those clothes, amigo?
[86:51.64]Packy or us?
[86:53.56]Come on.
[86:57.66]Ooh.
[86:58.86]I know careful isn't in your vocabulary, but be careful with that car.
[87:05.32]This could end very badly.
[87:11.98]You're such a spoil sport sometimes.
[87:14.26]You know that?
[87:18.05]You think I'm an idiot?
[87:19.65]You can't drive a car out without the thing open.
[87:23.23]This is a nice car too.
[87:32.07]How am I supposed to get this out of here?
[87:39.52]I have to take this out?
[87:43.50]Through the fucking corn maze?
[87:53.53]Got it.
[87:55.01]It's almost dead.
[87:58.29]Wait, do that again.
[88:07.97]God damn it.
[88:08.53]No, wait, back, back, back, back, back, back further.
[88:10.55]Back further.
[88:12.85]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[88:14.27]Back it up.
[88:15.93]Oh, fuck.
[88:16.75]Alright, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[88:20.19]Nope.
[88:22.81]Straight ahead!
[88:26.04]What is blocking the car?
[88:30.20]Oh, come on!
[88:51.55]Reverse bullseye.
[88:53.01]It's still drivable.
[88:56.49]I think the car is still dri- No, it's gone.
[89:02.79]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[89:04.09]Take the actual save that I just did.
[89:05.71]Alright.
[89:10.37]This time, let's do it.
[89:16.41]I got it.
[89:17.21]Don't worry.
[89:18.09]Calm down, everybody.
[89:26.56]I got five rewinds.
[89:27.47]I'm fine.
[89:35.61]Oh, yeah.
[89:36.51]Look at how cool that was.
[89:41.97]Oh, that's what I was supposed to do.
[89:42.83]I'm going to go over the edge here.
[89:45.26]I can't go that way.
[89:47.28]Okay.
[89:57.63]Come on, get back on the road.
[90:03.49]What the fuck was that?
[90:04.49]That thing was like a slingshot that was queued up to run into me.
[90:07.40]I think there's a grandmother in that car.
[90:13.44]Spicy.
[90:13.80]That only took like 35 minutes.
[90:29.67]I just did that.
[90:30.41]I could have just saved you a lot of trouble.
[90:34.81]You need to learn the language of the streets before playing with the big boys.
[90:41.07]Okay.
[90:45.86]If that's all you wanted, I just did that like six times.
[90:48.32]Yeah.
[90:51.46]If that's what you wanted me to do, I could have failed the mission like four times.
[90:57.63]Alright, here we go.
[90:58.61]Open world.
[90:59.09]We're back to the open world.
[91:01.99]Here comes Ghost Rider.
[91:08.03]What?
[91:18.09]Somebody didn't think that spawn point through very much.
[91:34.57]That guy was alive.
[91:41.10]Alright, let's go one more here.
[91:45.89]Holy fuck, they're behind me.
[91:57.88]One last one.
[91:58.89]One last guy.
[91:59.51]Ooh, what an ending kill.
[92:02.95]That'll teach you to be polite to us turistas, cabrón.
[92:06.11]What, were these just people?
[92:06.97]That guy's still falling.
[92:20.92]So I was just killing people.
[92:24.92]I wish you could throw objects.
[92:27.01]Alright, let's go do another mission.
[92:33.03]Ooh, a droplet.
[92:35.19]Mmm, taxi or taxi.
[92:39.29]Take me where I need to go.
[92:41.37]How about Marco's Junkyard.
[92:43.35]El Macho Bar.
[92:44.07]Let's go.
[92:45.17]Hello, buddy.
[92:46.01]I'm going to die.
[92:50.66]By the way, I'm just figuring this out.
[92:52.66]Everyone said, hey, what are you doing?
[92:53.76]It's free.
[92:54.22]It's free.
[92:54.58]I'm like, what are they talking about?
[92:55.38]It's free.
[92:56.84]Yeah, there's no such thing as money in this game.
[92:59.51]So, it has to be free.
[93:04.11]I'm forgetting this is not Grand Theft Auto.
[93:08.89]Alright, so where do we want to go?
[93:10.65]Over here?
[93:10.99]Can I jump that?
[93:14.17]No.
[93:17.42]Okay, how about the live sex show?
[93:20.61]Oh, too bad.

[93:30.57]I don't want to fuck with me again.

[98:07.30]People talk shit, I just ignore it.
[98:09.04]I don't give a fuck.
[98:24.67]Any of the rude stuff this guy's gonna do to other people?
[98:32.22]Okay, let's make the office square.
[98:34.58]Let's see what he does.
[98:36.79]How dare you?
[98:37.35]Get out of my way!
[98:37.95]Fuck you, fucking square!
[98:39.61]Yeah!
[98:44.67]Wait, there's... Wait, it's him.
[98:47.88]That's him right there.
[98:48.62]Wait, this is his twin brother.
[98:49.76]Why is he going to the bathroom?
[98:53.66]Is he gonna sit at the table?
[99:12.23]I think he's stuck here.
[99:14.74]I don't think he realizes it.
[99:19.28]Which is the right one?
[99:27.97]Did he dodge that or did I?
[99:29.49]I don't understand.
[99:48.72]This is him.
[99:52.39]Okay, well... He did, did he?
[100:06.99]Oh, I wasn't sure.
[100:09.97]Let's try it again.
[100:12.71]He has to defeat his own demons.
[100:18.26]Okay, so I have to find... Let's go quickly, because last time I bugged it out somehow.
[100:29.51]Maybe I have to get there faster?
[100:30.75]Hold on, I'll give you a car.
[100:38.53]Cars are randomly parked in such odd places in this game, seriously.
[100:44.52]Let's get there quick.
[100:45.68]It's right through here.
[100:49.80]Spicy move!
[100:50.75]Alright, got him.
[100:53.91]It's not this guy, come on.
[100:55.89]Oh, he didn't do the same thing again?
[101:02.11]No, okay, the stuff just wasn't loading.
[101:06.35]What's he doing?
[101:31.24]They're going to come back again.
[101:32.30]I'm going to get this one ready.
[101:33.24]I'm going to get the kill cam, show me who killed me weapon.
[101:45.83]Catch it.
[101:46.67]Nice.
[101:52.97]I'm hurt.
[102:06.52]Nice job, man.
[102:07.10]Alright, don't shoot the brother accidentally.
[102:08.80]I know I will.
[102:09.28]Alright, let's do the kill cam weapon.
[102:11.46]Golden gun!
[102:18.18]Golden gun!
[102:19.08]No, fuck, I didn't want to do that.
[102:21.34]Can I turn it off?
[102:26.82]Where'd he go?
[102:27.36]Oh, fuck.
[102:27.88]I think I have to use this before it goes away.
[102:33.35]So that's at least a good thing.
[102:39.15]Reunited.
[102:41.05]Finish!
[102:45.92]Thanks.
[102:46.30]1-1-1.
[102:47.96]Best move.
[102:49.20]35.
[102:49.34]Times 80.
[102:50.28]Whatever it was.
[102:50.76]Does this guy have another mission?
[103:02.09]Missing brother again.
[103:10.43]No, there's a deputy right there.
[103:12.33]Alright, so what's the other ones to do?
[103:15.27]Next mission.
[103:16.75]So we got to do some cool moves, race, or get a new hat.
[103:22.00]Let's get the hat.
[103:22.60]I feel like that guy's brother gets kidnapped like every day.
[103:30.66]Alright, so find the sombrero seller.
[103:32.61]There he is.
[103:35.97]I don't think that's the sombrero seller.
[103:37.15]I think that's just a happy customer.
[103:47.23]That guy's car alarm just went off.
[103:51.11]That's quite the horn you have.
[103:53.47]Well, he's over here.
[103:54.59]Fuck this guy.
[103:55.09]I'm going to ghost ride him off the cliff.
[103:56.77]Never mind.
[103:57.05]Let's go get a sombrero.
[104:17.96]Why are you hiding behind boxes?
[104:23.74]What?
[104:31.65]It's a trap.
[104:37.05]Oh, is it now?
[104:39.69]Interesting.
[104:59.47]God damn it, I don't have a... No!
[105:01.17]Hahaha!
[105:11.65]Spicy move!
[105:21.08]Oh yeah, watch this!
[105:21.78]HURRICANE!
[105:23.30]AHHHHH!
[105:27.66]Let's do that again.
[105:28.62]Who cares?
[105:29.10]Let's do it twice.
[105:34.96]Who's left?
[105:39.62]Holy shit, that guy took a thousand bullets.
[105:41.82]Ah!
[105:58.44]Give me the hat!
[106:04.41]Give me the hat!
[106:10.55]Do I get a hat for that?
[106:17.80]So I don't get a hat.
[106:24.02]That's stupid, where's my hat?
[106:28.10]I was under the impression I was going to get a hat out of this.
[106:32.06]Oh, well.
[106:34.38]Let's get the points.
[106:35.76]Come on, you can't climb that.
[106:39.93]Stupid.
[106:40.25]Alright, let's go to choose mission.
[106:45.23]Get the trucks.
[106:48.87]Lift three big trucks that he needs for trafficking 100 tons of cocaine.
[106:54.71]Hold on a minute here.
[106:56.55]Three big trucks.
[106:58.84]to take 100 tons.
[107:06.69]That's a lot.
[107:08.45]That's more cocaine than has ever existed, I think.
[107:14.24]How much cocaine has ever been trafficked in the world?
[107:21.67]Okay, so I have to get all the cocaine that's ever existed, okay.
[107:24.25]Millions of tons?
[107:25.77]What?
[107:25.95]Maybe like 10 to 20 tons.
[107:26.65]Can't talk to you.
[107:47.19]¿Qué tal, gringo?
[107:48.23]Morales wants you to go in there and get the trucks out one by one.
[107:51.01]My drivers here will then take the trucks back.
[107:53.57]Ten cuidado.
[107:54.35]Just take it easy.
[107:55.63]Me?
[107:56.25]Take it easy?
[107:59.21]I once drank a hundred gallons of cocaine.
[108:03.22]Did you?
[108:05.90]That's interesting.
[108:07.94]So, when did you come to our planet, Mr. 5,000 foot tall giant super being?
[108:15.42]I'm curious.
[108:17.54]Alright, um... Steal the trucks.
[108:20.38]Without being seen.
[108:21.12]This is a stealth mission.
[108:28.70]He took his hat off.
[108:30.87]Today I'm gonna chug cocaine.
[108:40.83]Be sure to subscribe.
[108:50.23]That was like spray and spray if I've ever seen one.
[108:53.39]I don't want any interference here.
[108:57.99]Unlock the loco move.
[109:04.00]Let's just get it.
[109:06.96]This really is Labo music.
[109:08.16]This is Wii U music.
[109:09.52]No, you know what this sounds like?
[109:12.66]This is like somebody picked up GarageBand for the first time.
[109:15.80]And made a loop.
[109:20.25]My adrenaline has increased.
[109:25.52]Okay.
[109:29.18]General score.
[109:29.78]You've achieved a score of 50,000 points.
[109:33.60]Congratulations.
[109:37.12]Here's the pickup point.
[109:38.88]So, how is this... I don't get it.
[109:42.01]Are these guys picking it up?
[109:44.71]Yeah, alright.
[109:45.71]There's a jump there, so I have to do it.
[109:51.68]That's probably what it actually is.
[109:53.36]Actually, I saw somebody request a stream and I had a lot of thumbs up in the Discord for me just to go get like Fruity Loops or GarageBand and just make a bunch of fucking stupid songs.
[110:15.63]I might actually do that.
[110:16.65]That's not a bad idea.
[110:19.12]I gotta get the other ones.
[110:27.39]Do it now?
[110:28.11]What do you mean do- I don't have any of that stuff!
[110:34.15]I would wanna do sampling, I'd wanna get like an actual thing to do that with.
[110:41.18]We'll do a thing where we pick like a favorite TV show, a favorite genre of music, and a favorite food item, and like sample a bunch of commercials and like fuckin' TV shows and stuff and just put it in.
[110:56.03]Sub gifting?
[110:56.57]Wait, we have a lot of sub gifts here?
[111:02.96]I didn't even see it.
[111:03.92]Somebody gave a bunch of gifts?
[111:04.84]Subs?
[111:05.52]Somebody said, sub gifting here?
[111:08.26]Do I play any instruments?
[111:09.08]I used to play the drums.
[111:10.38]Very poorly, but I did know the basics.
[111:16.47]Who gave the subs?
[111:22.89]So I get rid of the containers.
[111:33.71]Hold on, I need that.
[111:39.91]You know what?
[111:41.53]That's how I want to go.
[111:42.29]You know what I mean?
[111:45.44]Like, no, forget about that.
[111:46.74]I want to be, like, busy.
[111:49.40]And then just instantly disappear.
[111:53.88]Like, when I'm 80 years old, or like 90 years old, and it's like, I'm finally at the end.
[112:00.09]Just, like, put me on a forklift and tell me to drive forward, Grandpa.
[112:04.39]And then, like, oh, I drive forward!
[112:06.64]This is fun!
[112:07.54]And I'm just gone.
[112:12.86]Oh!
[112:15.42]Oh, come on.
[112:24.31]But my only request is, let me pick up a couple things first, you know?
[112:29.27]Let me at least play around for like a minute.
[112:32.17]Oh, wow!
[112:32.87]This is fun!
[112:33.51]I can pick up this thing!
[112:34.61]Ooh!
[112:36.93]Look at it!
[112:37.31]Look at it!
[112:37.59]I can pick it!
[112:37.93]It's so heavy!
[112:39.25]And then you can do it.
[112:43.56]Okay.
[112:44.44]I have to probably use the forklift.
[112:50.18]Yeah, so I have to move.
[112:51.04]How do I move?
[112:52.27]This is just a Grand Theft Auto mission.
[112:53.75]Remember these terrible forklift missions?
[112:55.39]Why did they put them in here?
[113:01.45]Okay, there's a guy right here!
[113:02.80]How do I use this?
[113:12.62]How do I use the forklift?
[113:21.26]Uh... No!
[113:27.13]God damn it, it's not tab!
[113:28.83]What a waste.
[113:30.99]Um...
[113:34.87]Guys, of course it is.
[113:35.85]It's a game from, like, the 2000s.
[113:37.41]It's page up and page down.
[113:38.79]This thing can't blow up, though.
[113:42.86]Get out.
[113:43.12]Don't aim at this.
[113:46.60]Give me the health.
[113:53.23]Alright, I gotta... What am I gonna move?
[114:12.45]Can I pick these up?
[114:17.08]I don't think I can do that.
[114:18.00]I've got to carefully get through this.
[114:25.03]They're only on the right side, right?
[114:29.55]Okay, now lift it up.
[114:44.02]It's gonna- it's over here.
[114:44.96]It's not gonna go up the stairs.
[114:46.12]There's like a control thing that I have to pull.
[115:00.89]Where's the control room?
[115:01.81]The switch for the bridge is in the control house.
[115:07.82]I'm shipping it down the forklift.
[115:14.28]This game was made in like 2005, man.
[115:15.94]Give me a break.
[115:17.98]Everything is possible that far ago.
[115:19.82]Okay, now dual wield.
[115:22.78]Okay, give me the bridge.
[115:32.81]This game came out two years ago.
[115:34.19]No, it did not.
[115:38.37]This game did not come out two years ago.
[115:46.44]Alright.
[115:49.68]No.
[115:51.66]I think I fall all the way downstairs.
[116:01.33]Alright.
[116:02.59]I can go in the control room now.
[116:03.79]Lift up the thing.
[116:07.03]Extra HP.
[116:10.92]Okay.
[116:11.22]Now get up there.
[116:12.60]Hit the crane.
[116:14.92]I can now drive this out.
[116:20.83]Wait, stop moving.
[116:23.18]Is that enough to get it out?
[116:24.46]Can I get it out of here now?
[116:26.84]Why am I still moving?
[116:29.16]Stop moving.
[116:29.86]Why is it still going?
[116:32.58]How do I get out of here?
[116:35.34]Where am I going?
[116:35.96]I have to stop the ride!
[116:41.76]What's happening?
[116:45.60]I can't press the button.
[116:47.96]I can't get out.
[117:10.37]I'm good.
[117:13.03]I do need help.
[117:16.72]Like this sucker too.
[117:19.86]Skulls and bones.
[117:22.28]Take this one out to the pickup point.
[117:25.92]Holy shit.
[117:27.22]Someone's giving out a ton of subs.
[117:30.99]Atrolux is giving out ten subscriptions.
[117:37.03]Ten.
[117:39.62]Thank you, Atrolux, for your super community airdrop.
[117:43.06]That's a lot.
[117:45.58]That's a lot of money.
[117:47.79]That's $50.
[117:55.37]How does it work?
[117:56.79]How does a community, um... Is it just random people that don't have a sub?
[118:01.35]Or do you pick certain people to give it to?
[118:04.39]You can gift up to a hundred.
[118:07.71]What?
[118:13.36]So you just give a hundred random people in here.
[118:15.82]That's insane.
[118:16.46]Alright, we needed one more.
[118:22.87]Still can't figure out how to get this.
[118:24.95]Okay, it's like that.
[118:25.79]That's easy.
[118:27.53]Well, thank you, Atrolux.
[118:35.82]More gifted subs.
[118:36.74]More gifted subs coming in.
[118:39.33]Status Faction's giving out subs too.
[118:42.27]Everybody's getting a sub tonight, apparently.
[118:45.23]That's not true.
[118:45.65]That's not going to happen.
[118:47.21]But I'm just saying that as an interesting point of reference.
[118:49.89]Alright, up here.
[118:55.66]So it was taking me across the way.
[118:58.84]But I didn't need to go there yet because I needed to get the other one.
[119:03.84]Holy shit.

[119:48.60]Thanks a lot, guys.
[119:51.02]Alright, that guy had a hard ha- Oh fuck, that's a grenade!
[120:01.47]I deactivated it.
[120:02.77]Just go up the stairs.
[120:10.32]You're sleeping with the fish now, hombre.
[120:13.24]I can't go up the stairs.
[120:13.86]He's in the way.
[120:14.62]His head is in the way.
[120:20.33]Listen to all these sub sounds.
[120:24.01]Spicy move.
[120:28.21]I just got to get into the... Giving up super spy burger flipper with five community subs.
[120:38.45]Thank you, super spy.
[120:40.69]Oh my god.
[120:46.37]Oh shit, I gotta be careful.
[120:50.39]That's grenade again!
[120:51.23]Is that a live grenade or is that a grenade I can pick up?
[121:10.27]So I gotta get in there.
[121:17.07]What is this guy saying?
[121:19.07]Something very fast.
[121:25.61]Alright.
[121:26.69]So.
[121:27.55]That puts us up here.
[121:28.27]E to use.

[122:05.63]Oh, fucking god.
[122:07.79]Haunty is giving out five subs.
[122:13.55]Five subs from Haunted.
[122:17.77]What is going on?
[122:19.23]It's called the crazy sub giveaway night, apparently.
[122:21.69]There's some generous people in chat here.
[122:30.10]At what point does sub only mode become useless?
[122:34.22]That's a good question.
[122:37.17]I don't really use sub-only mode, so... I don't use it very, very sparingly.
[122:41.81]Hey, Sheekzio!
[122:43.01]SheXOXO!
[122:44.15]Five community subs!
[122:49.59]What have I done?
[122:50.27]Hold on a minute.
[123:01.73]Uh...
[123:06.07]Did I miss something here?
[123:08.87]Do I have to go all the way over there?
[123:11.77]I'm so confused.
[123:15.66]Go inside the ship.
[123:24.26]I mean, I got the indicator over there.
[123:26.68]That's like the thing to deliver, but... I'm probably going to die.
[123:34.50]STJAR five subs.
[123:37.92]Sorry, it's kind of hard to pay attention.
[123:39.86]There's a lot going on.
[123:40.98]This never ends.
[123:47.31]Five from STJAR.
[123:51.27]Thank you, dude.
[123:59.97]Get one to me.
[124:03.77]Gotta spread the love a little.

[124:06.91]You guys are very kind.
[124:18.46]What a nice group of people we got here.
[124:25.38]Oi!
[124:31.13]Oh my fucking god.
[124:35.41]You guys are going to pass my all-time sub high, I think, for one day.
[124:40.17]Are you shitting me?
[124:41.93]Amco the Terrible just gave out 20 subs.
[124:48.76]Thank you, Amco the Terrible, for the 20.
[124:54.48]20 community subs.

[125:26.83]Tim Allen has taken over the stream.
[125:28.29]That's not even Tim Allen.
[125:29.37]Why am I keep saying that?
[125:30.33]Alright, we can press this button.
[125:34.14]Eefs, thank you Eefs for five community subs.

[126:29.45]Now I have to go... Where do I go from here?
[126:36.90]I wasn't paying very much attention.
[126:38.97]I think I can do the slide thing now.
[126:45.43]Credits are going to be longer than the stream.
[126:48.11]That'd be crazy.
[126:54.36]Chat is in gift sub only mode.
[126:57.72]Does that allow me to move this here now?
[127:05.73]Good luck reading that.
[127:09.15]Okay, the car is now there.
[127:11.06]I can just drive it out.
[127:15.80]I can't just drop.
[127:17.70]Yes, I can.
[127:20.66]That would be a very bad idea.

[134:34.96]Nice going, bro.
[134:36.52]These trucks are gonna be used in Morales' big trafficking deal.
[134:39.70]You just got here like five seconds ago?
[134:42.74]So give me my one-way ticket back to Venice Beach.
[134:45.46]A bunch of people in chat generously decided to give subs to people.
[134:52.06]Well, one or two.
[134:53.72]Right, that's pretty funny.
[134:55.62]We're nearly getting killed and shit.
[134:57.92]If you're scared, then hey, let's call it a day.
[135:01.94]Screw you, I'll do it.
[135:03.74]But as soon as you guys bust Cesar Morales, I'm out of here.
[135:06.97]Then my short but hairy career as a DEA agent is over.
[135:11.54]If I'm still alive.
[135:12.72]Listen, this is highly confidential.
[135:16.04]Stay close to those trucks.
[135:17.66]Why is she spying on me?
[135:18.60]Do I not see her?
[135:19.48]Special assault team led by agents Pearson and Johnson.
[135:23.42]In to capture a stash of 100 tons of coke.
[135:26.91]And then Raman Ludlas just subscribed.
[135:31.84]He decided that, you know, I gave out like a hundred something subs.
[135:35.68]I probably wasn't going to sub too.
[135:40.32]Thank you, dude.
[135:44.06]A hundred tons of cocaine.
[135:54.32]I think we also had, did we have a big donation come in too that I missed?
[135:58.18]Make sure I didn't miss anything like that.
[136:07.24]No, I thought somebody said there was one.
[136:08.60]Just want to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[136:16.48]But, yeah.
[136:18.08]Seems like that is... That was very, very crazy.
[136:25.04]Very kind.
[136:26.20]Thank you, everybody, for participating in that.
[136:31.64]And back to the game we go.
[136:34.24]Some drug overlord found my stream.
[136:42.30]At least it's not more than five to ten seconds.
[136:45.70]What's going on?
[136:46.22]Am I in the car?
[136:49.54]Where did that car go?
[136:54.90]Just be happy we're not gonna listen to like a ten second paragraph.
[137:02.72]Thank you SNKFX for the five community subs.
[137:09.02]Thank you so much, dude.
[137:10.81]Bye, random people.
[137:12.65]I'm gonna get it.
[137:15.90]And speaking of getting it, check this out.
[137:32.68]Got it.
[137:34.40]Temporarily change the subsound to destroy him.
[137:39.22]I can't do it.
[137:39.84]Let's choose a mission.
[137:46.23]I just got one.
[137:46.89]Just got one!
[137:49.81]Downtown gate hunt.
[137:50.67]Drive fast without losing your head and get a minimum score of 250.
[137:54.79]A bad day.
[137:55.45]Help a guy get his car back.
[137:58.49]Let the lead flow and move your... It's lead...
[138:04.23]Do some payback for a friend.
[138:06.99]Getting trapped.
[138:07.63]Kill the bad guys and you were trapped?
[138:10.55]Let's do drive fast.
[138:20.08]Ready?
[138:22.08]Steady?
[138:24.05]Go!
[138:25.09]What?
[138:26.21]Why wasn't I allowed to be in the car first?
[138:29.61]And why do I have 47, 48,000 seconds?
[138:37.63]I just have to drive through the checkpoint.
[138:41.95]It's not really a race as much as it's a run around the circle.
[138:48.27]Come on.
[138:53.30]37,000.
[138:53.32]3,600.
[138:53.38]This car is a piece of shit, too.
[138:59.08]I don't know if I'm going to do this.
[139:00.88]I thought I was doing...
[139:11.24]Down the street.
[139:11.90]I might be able to get it.
[139:16.62]That's years of time.
[139:19.14]Is it?
[139:19.38]It's like 5,000 seconds.
[139:24.19]No, it's not.
[139:25.81]That's like a year and a half.
[139:28.33]No, it's not.
[139:28.61]That's like two months.
[139:29.51]That's like three months.
[139:31.51]No!
[139:39.95]It's right here.
[139:40.81]I'm not going to get it.
[139:42.47]I can't rewind.
[139:43.49]Try again.
[139:47.18]5,000 seconds is one hour and 23 minutes.
[140:09.62]Oh, you mean it's not like three years?
[140:11.78]It's like an hour.
[140:25.51]It's a goddamn lifetime.
[140:26.97]I've like been streaming for that long.
[140:37.04]You have no concept of time?
[140:39.93]No, not really.
[140:42.15]Wait, I gotta hit this.
[140:44.70]This is a big one.
[140:52.68]That was a waste of time, but, uh, actually, maybe not.
[140:54.26]This doesn't have to be slow motion, but even the boring shitty ones...
[141:09.62]No, I don't want to do this again.
[141:11.36]That one sucked.
[141:15.00]I know.
[141:15.36]Get out of the fucking way.
[141:26.87]I did it!
[141:45.23]That's from Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.
[141:47.51]Sounded like that song.
[141:55.74]Sub train's still going.
[141:57.02]You can still hear it.
[141:59.22]You guys, you can always tell when a sub happens, because you hear...
[142:23.46]What?
[142:37.79]Oh, more community subs are incoming!
[142:43.96]Mysterious, thanks for the five community subs.

[143:25.27]Thank you, Soupset, for the five community subs.
[143:30.85]Thank you.
[143:33.59]Okay, I feel like that's what would happen to me.
[143:38.03]I feel like I've done that before, trying to go off a jump scheme.
[143:42.08]You think you're so cool, and then you do it, and you can't do anything, and you just end up getting hurt.
[143:46.28]Thank you, Scripps3, for the five community subs.
[143:55.16]Scripts 3.
[144:03.00]Thank you.
[144:04.24]All you guys.
[144:07.15]Really appreciate it.
[144:10.25]You should try ski jumping.
[144:11.73]No.
[144:14.71]No, I'm not going to do that.
[144:16.31]No.
[144:20.48]That was kind of cool, wasn't it?
[144:21.50]Don't you think so?
[144:25.18]Let's do the story mission.
[144:29.18]Escort the trucks.
[144:34.27]Do I suck my thumb?
[144:35.57]Not since I was a little boy.
[144:47.09]He takes up the whole backseat.
[144:48.07]Ah, mi gringo favorito.
[144:50.21]Listen, you know the three trucks you recovered?
[144:53.53]Now I have to send them through Virgilio territory to a secret location.
[144:58.51]Go to Marco.
[144:59.35]He'll give you tools and instructions.
[145:01.05]Fat fuck spotted.
[145:02.40]Jesus.
[145:04.62]Here he is, el hombre.
[145:07.58]Cesar's giving you a big job, muy importante.
[145:11.04]Now listen, meet the trucks at the truck stop outside of town.
[145:14.51]Hey, wait a minute.
[145:16.13]Morales told me you got some tools for me.
[145:19.08]I'm gonna go insane from the Tim Allen sound.
[145:22.92]Wait a minute!
[145:23.66]Wait a minute!
[145:24.66]Give me that slap bass.
[145:47.70]Oh, he had slap face for a second.
[145:49.15]Protect the truck.
[145:51.63]Oh, these trucks.
[145:53.53]What do I have loudspeakers for?
[145:59.35]Protect the trucks.
[146:01.52]I got a better idea.
[146:02.20]Excuse me.
[146:05.92]Excuse me.
[146:18.57]How about we get on top?
[146:19.67]I'm trying to gore myself on this.
[146:30.44]That's not what I wanted to do, I'm sorry.
[146:34.81]Nevermind, I tried.
[146:40.01]Move the road block so the trucks can pass.
[146:41.71]Slice.
[146:41.93]Ooh, got ya.
[146:42.45]Why did you not hit him?
[146:43.77]What the heck?
[147:11.94]Here we go, I'll get it this time Don't shoot those!
[147:47.74]Whoops.
[147:48.66]You know what?
[147:49.24]Fuck it.
[147:59.63]I'm targeting the boxes.
[148:01.53]Oh, good thing you got those boxes.
[148:08.79]Oh, stop it.
[148:15.57]Alright, let's go.
[148:16.57]No, there's more people to kill.
[148:18.97]Okay, hold on.
[148:22.34]Those arms flailing.
[148:23.36]I need health, man.
[148:24.82]What do they know?
[148:25.40]Wait, wait, wait.
[148:26.20]Don't come in here yet.
[148:45.97]Don't drive in here yet.
[148:47.89]Have you lost your mind?
[148:50.90]Watch out, that guy's got a grenade!
[148:57.41]That's just throwing grenades!
[149:12.59]It fits so well.
[149:14.11]It feels like it's part of the music, it really does.
[149:24.88]Why are you out of your mind?
[149:26.16]Alright, head, show it to me.
[149:28.98]Your clothes, give it to me.
[149:30.49]Your head, show it to me.
[149:45.00]Just get rid of the roadblock.
[149:46.44]None of this matters.
[149:48.06]Oh, wait, I have this thing.
[149:49.22]Oh, whoa.
[149:50.50]Alright, fuck it.
[150:03.71]Huracan!
[150:14.92]That's what I call a... You know what I'm saying?
[150:16.82]Guys just threw a grenade at the wall.
[150:21.46]Dumb.
[150:22.21]Idiot.
[150:24.61]Okay, let's go.
[150:27.75]Come on, guys!
[150:28.19]Let's go!
[150:32.09]Okay.
[150:40.45]Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
[150:56.74]Saving.
[150:58.51]Loading.
[151:08.55]I can't wait to make songs for you guys.
[151:09.99]They're gonna be so good.
[151:15.80]When I do that stream, I have to have at least five complete tracks.
[151:21.18]Nice going, man.
[151:22.12]Hang in there.
[151:24.32]So, what's anymore?
[151:25.50]Uh-oh.
[151:25.70]Listen.
[151:27.23]Pearson, Johnson, and their men are outside the factory wall.
[151:31.65]Get back to the front gate and open it so the assault team can get in.
[151:39.26]I didn't get anybody.
[151:43.69]Why do I have cows?
[151:45.35]What?
[151:51.86]What was that guy's plan?
[151:54.80]Not a good idea!
[151:55.36]I'm gonna go speed over in a forklift!
[152:10.87]I'm gonna powerbomb this guy.
[152:13.07]Spicy move!
[152:14.79]See that?
[152:16.19]Okay, let's go.
[152:19.15]Proceeds to adopt his plan.
[152:21.01]No, I just wanted to... What the hell was that noise?
[152:34.90]This guy's just whipping grenades past me.
[152:37.15]He's gonna be... How many grenades does he have?
[152:42.28]Ooh, almost buddy.
[152:49.31]Can I catch him and throw him back?
[152:54.93]I feel like I can catch those.
[153:04.35]No, no, don't get, stop doing that!
[153:06.13]You fucking idiot, I wanna play baseball.
[153:12.16]I'll get it.
[153:17.34]God damn it, come on.
[153:19.65]No, I hit it the wrong way.
[153:54.47]Oh shit.
[153:57.63]We're both not very good at this.
[154:03.27]Wait, hold on, he got it!
[154:07.67]He got it!
[154:08.29]How did he get it?
[154:13.74]I'm surprised he actually got that.
[154:15.20]Alright, here we go.
[154:25.86]Pearson, Johnson, and their men are outside the factory walls.
[154:30.06]Got it.
[154:30.50]Back to the front gate and open it so the assault team can get in.
[154:34.31]I need to follow this guy around.
[154:44.88]Why is he still in it?
[154:46.74]He has the headphones on and everything.
[155:07.24]Oh, this is great.
[155:09.02]Okay.
[155:11.02]Start that base up.
[155:12.00]Oh, what's that?
[155:12.72]Instant death!
[155:14.76]You're not going to have a chance to do it, are you?
[155:17.46]I had to do the golden gun.
[155:19.16]Let's knock the music up.
[155:49.68]Dust!
[155:53.34]Alright.
[155:53.68]Forklift fight.
[155:57.24]No!
[155:57.92]He can't push me outside the ring!
[155:59.06]Don't do it!
[155:59.48]Spicy move!
[156:05.82]Yeah, that's right.
[156:06.68]Now you lose.
[156:07.70]You lost your operator.
[156:08.78]The guy's with the grenades.
[156:16.03]Where is he?
[156:19.13]Spicy move!
[156:22.15]Back it up.
[156:24.41]I gotta go around.
[156:24.99]I can't go through the door with this, can I?
[156:30.78]No, of course I can't.
[156:31.68]Why would I think I could do that?
[156:36.24]What do I need to do?
[156:36.86]Open this door?
[156:37.36]I think I just had it.
[156:43.85]I just had it.
[156:46.57]So that's me being a dumb idiot because that guy just was over there.
[156:49.54]I thought I could... It's alright, whatever.
[156:54.38]Not a big deal.
[157:01.99]Extra weave lines.
[157:17.95]Where are these cows coming from?
[157:21.52]Talk to the gun, because the face ain't listening.
[157:25.14]What am I doing?
[157:28.52]What happened?
[157:29.14]What did I just do?
[157:29.62]Why do I have a friend now?
[157:34.88]Why would you shoot in point blank?
[157:38.40]Why?
[157:39.20]You're not a fucking good friend at all.
[157:50.46]I don't want him near me with that thing.
[157:52.28]Seriously.
[157:54.46]Go on your own.
[157:59.39]Is he still here?
[158:02.79]Yeah, he's still here.
[158:05.41]This stupid motherfucker is throwing shit.
[158:09.01]What the fuck?
[158:10.51]No, man.
[158:11.11]There's a goddamn save point.
[158:13.60]If the stupid guy with the hat on wasn't with me, this wouldn't have happened.
[158:18.74]I pressed...
[158:23.49]Alright, clean.
[158:26.17]Uh-oh.
[158:26.93]Listen.
[158:27.85]Pearson, Johnson, and their men are outside the factory walls.
[158:32.27]Get back to the front gate and open it so the assault team can get in.
[158:40.37]Oh, shit!
[158:46.20]That scared the fuck out of me.
[158:47.42]Alright.
[158:53.92]Got it.
[158:59.85]Serious gamer time, it is.
[159:01.05]Alright, can I, uh, save point?
[159:09.73]Where did Skull Man go?
[159:12.11]I activated him.
[159:12.81]I think it's like a... It's one of my powers.
[159:16.29]But not in an enclosed space like this.
[159:18.17]That's a bad idea.
[159:24.20]Let's go.
[159:26.09]Wait.
[159:27.67]Are you guys on my team?
[159:32.15]I'm confused of who's actually on my team.
[159:43.21]Music doesn't help.
[159:46.13]God damn, you guys seriously not... He's dead.
[159:51.18]No, he's not.
[160:00.12]Nope.
[160:00.76]Not gonna happen.
[160:01.98]I'm going up.
[160:09.17]It's still going.
[160:17.23]Who's left?
[160:29.30]I tried.
[160:29.62]I'm gonna go for a dive here around the corner.
[160:36.50]I didn't do shit.
[160:43.44]Nice try.
[160:44.33]You didn't impress the girl that had... ...resets.
[160:48.83]I'm trying to say words.
[160:50.95]I'm coming out so well.
[160:53.11]Alright, press the button.
[160:58.00]I just had, like, fucking peanut butter in my mouth trying to save that.
[161:04.04]What just fucking hit me, man?
[161:06.30]Come on.
[161:20.59]Shoot him.
[161:23.96]I don't get it.
[161:25.78]I don't understand.
[161:27.54]You know what?
[161:28.06]We're going to have to just do this, man.
[161:36.71]Not one person got hit by that.
[161:37.97]There we go.
[161:45.41]That guy killed his own rifle into his own body.
[161:50.16]Idiot.
[161:50.58]Idiot.
[162:01.75]Why?
[162:02.01]I didn't get it on my head.
[162:02.87]Why does that guy keep going to the forklift?
[162:10.21]That's a great question.
[162:13.86]I don't know how much more I can handle this music.
[162:25.82]Take the door open.
[162:30.43]Alright, I'm charging in there.
[162:46.85]How do I turn this off?
[162:49.77]I can't turn it off.
[162:52.79]This is on forever.
[162:55.11]Oh, there we go.
[162:57.72]Is this a meat factory?
[163:05.54]There's the guy, right?
[163:07.11]Oh, come on.
[163:07.71]Now I gotta push him into the meat grinder, right?
[163:11.07]That has to happen.
[163:16.79]In what world do I not do that?
[163:28.22]I have one bullet in that gun.
[163:35.06]What?
[163:36.06]There's gotta be a payoff whether it's set up that good.
[163:44.26]You would assume, right?
[163:46.14]They're over there.
[163:49.38]Did I seriously just hurt myself that much?
[163:55.71]There was too much weight on there.
[164:05.47]I tried to tell him, when you got like four or five fat guys on the edge of a platform that's not stable, it's gonna fall.
[164:17.44]You gotta get some skinny guys up there.
[164:28.41]God, I need health.
[164:34.91]That fall's gonna kill me from here.
[164:35.99]Okay, there's a rewind right there.
[164:37.39]I just gotta go get it quick.
[164:39.46]Okay, we're good.
[164:44.46]Health, too.
[164:54.04]There's no way, that guy, I definitely hit that guy.
[165:07.51]He's just holding his gun down like that, shit, I'm gonna hit you.
[165:17.32]I'm dead.
[165:20.90]No, he's on my- That guy was on my own team too, and I just- Spicy move!
[165:36.57]Alright.
[165:37.37]Moving to the next area here.
[165:38.29]Ah!
[165:50.68]Easy, easy.
[165:56.50]Watch this!
[165:58.49]One, two, three, and do it!
[166:00.89]All three are dead.
[166:07.11]But I don't know where the fuck you came from!
[166:10.79]I just- I did the loco move while you were in there and it didn't hit this guy.
[166:15.41]This guy is still alive.
[166:27.48]Oh my fucking god, man.
[166:29.03]You gotta be kidding me.
[166:32.43]Seriously.
[166:34.33]Oh my god.
[166:35.01]I'm just... I don't even give a fuck anymore.
[166:36.67]I'm just doing moves.
[166:37.73]I'm doing these moves.
[166:39.99]Until I'm done.
[166:40.57]Just open the doors.
[166:46.75]Only do these moves.
[166:48.11]Don't do anything else.
[167:04.13]We're going full loco here.
[167:05.63]Alright, open this door now.
[167:14.96]Every single ounce of that guy's blood was just removed from his body.
[167:17.87]I embalmed that fucking guy.
[167:19.25]That's how much damage I just did.
[167:22.09]Alright, down here.
[167:33.53]Done.
[167:34.71]One last guy.
[167:39.57]Extra health.
[167:41.97]Okay.
[167:42.75]Now.
[167:44.49]Make it happen.
[167:49.34]What do I do?
[167:53.26]What happened?
[167:53.68]What am I missing here?
[167:59.64]Oh, right.
[168:00.24]Troll room.
[168:02.46]Eat the gun?
[168:03.86]No, I'm not eating the gun.
[168:05.31]No, no, no, no, no.
[168:10.61]Alright, so the music here.
[168:13.53]This is the part of, um... And you blew it.
[168:17.27]He blew it.
[168:18.37]I was gonna make a joke.
[168:19.67]And you ruined it.
[168:22.40]Come on.
[168:25.40]That's so unfortunate.
[168:26.86]That was gonna be very funny.
[168:32.09]That's the part of the music where the artist stops the song and starts talking about something.
[168:40.55]And takes like a few minutes in the middle of the song at a live concert.
[168:47.86]Going on a rant about something and then it's like... Then they start singing again.
[168:53.88]God damn it.
[168:55.42]I would have made that.
[168:56.26]It would have been the best joke you've ever heard on fucking Twitch.
[168:58.50]You understand?
[169:10.97]I would have been a master of comedy.
[169:12.27]Don't you get it?
[169:17.35]There's a reason why I came in fourth place at the Southern Massachusetts Comedy Festival.
[169:25.22]There were 22 other contestants and 180 people in the audience.
[169:43.23]Let's go.
[169:48.28]Is he dead?
[170:01.13]You're fucking with the South Boston, regional Southern Massachusetts champion.
[170:05.73]And then I went on to the finals.
[170:09.13]Well, I mean, it was the quarterfinals, but that doesn't matter.
[170:13.65]I lost to a guy that pulled a chair.
[170:15.89]Listen to this.
[170:17.11]I did a whole set.
[170:18.43]I talked about like politics and community.
[170:21.55]And I talked about like trash pickup.
[170:23.73]I did a whole trash pickup routine.
[170:25.91]And a guy comes out after me.
[170:27.55]Pulls a chair into the center of the stage.
[170:30.00]Blows up a whoopee cushion.
[170:31.84]Sits on it.
[170:33.20]And the fucking crowd went crazy.
[170:35.62]I was like 14 and I had the best material ever.
[170:37.90]These guys didn't even fall in the meat grinder.
[170:39.88]Why?
[170:52.61]No, don't do it again!
[170:53.49]Alright.
[170:54.67]That's how you get- you're gonna get fucked by the fucking Regional Comedy Massachusetts Champion!
[171:21.25]Alright, so what happened there was that entire hitbox of the whole thing there is the meat grinder.
[171:29.22]If you touch it, you die.
[171:30.66]I was trying to jump across to move away from it so I could just go right to the exit.
[171:34.22]Okay, I'm going to be quiet now.
[171:35.64]I'm not going to talk.
[171:37.59]I'm going to literally just beat this without getting one point of damage.
[171:48.47]Fuck.
[171:52.23]Pearson, Johnson, and their men are outside the factory walls.
[171:56.49]Get back to the front gate and open it so the assault team can get in.
[172:50.01]Okay, alright, I gotta get out of here I gotta stop this now like this is not hard to stop it I
[173:10.33]He's losing it.
[173:11.05]Yeah, I am.
[173:12.01]Open.
[173:20.52]What the fuck is this?
[173:24.70]I don't know why.
[173:46.72]That was, that was like kind of scary.
[173:48.22]I didn't like that at all.
[173:51.18]Anybody else get scared by that?
[173:52.32]Bingo, watch that.
[173:58.45]Oh man, I would have won a fucking festival for that one.
[174:01.23]Alright, I'm moving on from that stupid shitty joke.
[174:22.50]Give me that health.
[174:23.12]Alright.
[174:25.07]Up, up we go.
[174:28.59]What have I got?
[174:31.55]Okay, we got the... I'm going to take out the golden gun.
[174:33.77]Because this one is very, very fun.
[174:37.56]It's very easy to get some kills.
[174:39.70]And... Okay, I was going to say, why do those guys still alive?
[174:52.34]Where is he?
[174:59.01]Wait, what?
[174:59.59]Harding?
[174:59.99]Wait, I guess Harding?
[175:02.29]We got a heart situation here?
[175:18.66]Good.
[175:19.08]Got three rewinds now.
[175:20.30]I'm ready.
[175:22.28]Not going to lose this time.
[175:39.37]What are you doing?
[175:44.16]Not going to happen.
[175:45.20]I got three of these.
[176:16.35]I told you I'm shutting the fuck up.
[176:29.31]Okay.
[176:30.97]So I want to ask you guys something.
[176:33.43]Can you put your hands in the air for me?
[176:35.92]Just like that.
[176:38.28]Now on the count of three, I want you guys to say how good of a time you're having it tonight.
[176:41.06]Fucking have ruined it.
[176:41.80]Goddamn.
[176:42.26]What?
[176:42.46]Never.
[176:42.74]But just go.
[176:44.12]Beat the goddamn game.
[176:57.25]Cut off!
[176:59.17]Hey, how about you?
[176:59.81]Eat shit!
[177:24.44]Where is he?
[177:27.75]Don't fall off this.
[177:28.75]Alright, we're good.
[177:31.77]I won.
[177:33.45]Hey, Lightning Rider!
[177:34.43]I have 10 seconds!
[177:40.68]Okay, I made it.
[177:44.06]Wait, was this the right gate to... What happened?
[177:48.10]Did I go in the wrong gate?
[177:52.24]It took me 10 seconds to figure that out.
[177:57.12]I'm confused.
[177:57.70]I went to the wrong gate.
[178:01.88]Alright.
[178:02.54]Lightning.
[178:03.24]Thank you, Lightning, for your community sub gifts.
[178:07.56]Thank you so much.
[178:08.22]So, wait.
[178:09.57]It's the one next to it?
[178:11.59]It's the one next to it.
[178:12.55]Okay.
[178:12.89]God damn it.
[178:19.61]Alright.
[178:35.54]I thought I was fucking around.
[178:36.34]I said we were going fast, huh?
[178:44.86]Why can't I... Alright, good.
[178:56.54]Nice drop, DEA guy.
[178:58.53]Keep that going.
[178:59.07]Actually, you know... I wanna do it.
[179:03.31]That's the fun thing.
[179:04.07]I wanna do the fun thing.
[179:10.80]Okay, he's off.
[179:14.25]You're a steak.
[179:19.99]This thing kinda sucks.
[179:30.24]Done.
[179:31.26]Go.
[179:39.96]What is that fire?
[179:43.53]Why is it fire everywhere?
[179:44.75]I don't know.
[179:51.09]Kill him.
[179:51.37]He called you a steak?
[179:52.71]He didn't call me a steak.
[179:53.59]He called the bad guys a steak.
[179:58.08]I'm ready for the ambush.
[180:03.46]Pressing one button.
[180:10.98]That was it.
[180:13.42]Oh, there are more people in here.
[180:14.48]I think I'm going to turn the ball on.
[180:25.51]No, don't turn the ball on.
[180:26.65]Not necessary.
[180:27.15]Just find the one spot.
[180:35.08]And...
[180:40.98]Should I get them all?
[180:42.85]Some of them?
[180:43.21]Most of them?
[180:43.67]What's on the other side?
[180:48.87]Did I finally find the egg, did I?
[180:55.16]Not really.
[180:56.80]There's a save point in here, though.
[181:01.90]Hold on a minute here.
[181:02.89]What?
[181:04.27]That's a...
[181:09.92]Jesus Christ, okay.
[181:17.59]It is dangerous.
[181:19.55]Thank God I found the save.
[181:20.53]Now I can relax.
[181:27.38]Uh-oh.
[181:30.12]Electricity off, escaping the facility.
[181:42.04]This doesn't shock the whole thing, right?
[181:45.14]I keep getting the DEA at bad.
[181:56.87]What's up?
[181:57.25]What's up there?
[182:02.51]Oh god.
[182:04.20]Nothing bad?
[182:10.60]The truck?
[182:13.79]I don't know.
[182:14.37]I'm trying to shoot the truck.
[182:25.12]Now jump.
[182:25.82]Jump out of the way.
[182:26.40]Why is he not jumping?
[182:29.10]Alright, good.
[182:41.50]Up and around.
[182:41.96]I'm gonna go up this way.
[182:45.44]This is intense though, I'll tell ya.
[182:52.60]I'm gonna go up.
[182:56.17]And then do I have to jump from here?
[183:01.29]Yep.
[183:05.23]Thank god I made it.
[183:07.10]If you're here to buy some ribs, you know what?
[183:09.58]Don't bother.
[183:10.70]the white crack's meathead grab this machine gun we got company this is really long yeah dude this is the longest mission of the game so far alright I got ten thousand points five thousand five thousand five thousand my stomach is starting to hurt getting like a bad weird queasy stomach feeling now I know why shoot them before they ram us
[183:40.24]Alright, gets 75,000 points.
[183:48.14]I had a slice of pizza that was in the fridge for like at least six days.
[183:51.54]Five days, probably.
[183:53.24]No, maybe like four days.
[183:55.14]What's the last finite amount of time you can have a piece of pizza in the fridge?
[184:02.91]Uh, real question.
[184:08.65]Two days?
[184:09.35]No, it's like four.
[184:10.99]Two or three days?
[184:13.29]But four days is okay though.
[184:17.51]I'm gonna die.
[184:30.20]I wouldn't trust pizza over four days.
[184:31.78]Yeah, it's been four days.
[184:33.08]Why did I buy it?
[184:37.51]Actually, let me look at my phone and see when I call the police.
[184:44.49]Before you blow on the dice.
[184:46.03]Eating bad pizza.
[184:55.95]Alright, somebody look up on Google.com, what happens if you eat four to five day old pizza in the fridge?
[185:06.78]Oh, man.
[185:08.00]I should have just stayed on my beach.
[185:12.70]Instant death.
[185:18.49]No more banjo for you, hillbilly.
[185:22.49]Nothing.
[185:22.83]You're fine.
[185:23.43]So much for Mexican hospitality.
[185:25.01]Why do I have, like, a stomachache?
[185:26.43]I feel like I'm going to puke.
[185:35.75]The game is very loud.
[185:36.61]I'm sorry.
[185:37.03]There's nothing I can do about it.
[185:43.77]The thing is, I did eat it like three and a half hours ago.
[185:49.96]The bad part about that, that guy did a very, very impressive shot.
[186:03.01]Right.
[186:03.75]So your punk brother escaped.
[186:05.45]It's not like a Walmart headquarters.
[186:06.72]We don't have like a DEA on a giant building.
[186:08.66]A bit fishy, don't you think?
[186:10.36]No.
[186:10.92]My brother would have ended up like the rest if it hadn't been for his guardian angel.
[186:14.84]Thanks to our family good looks, a Mexican female police agent managed to get him out before those goons found him.
[186:21.61]Cruz, is this going anywhere?
[186:23.95]Pardon me?
[186:24.65]I mean, we're into my lunch hour now, and all I've heard so far is how your idiot brother has demolished half of Los Toros.
[186:32.67]Sir, we're getting to the good stuff, really.
[186:35.90]This is very important.
[186:37.52]Believe me, please.
[186:40.62]Believe me.
[186:44.69]Believe me.
[186:47.21]Believe me.
[186:51.12]I guess a voice in Fallout?
[186:52.26]I'm sure he is.
[186:52.82]Well, I got a nice, cool house.
[187:03.55]Just redecorating.
[187:05.05]Alright, what are we doing?
[187:07.07]This toilet is huge.
[187:15.56]You wouldn't be able to sit on here.
[187:16.90]Hot and spicy.
[187:18.94]No, you can't sit there.
[187:21.84]You'll fall in this thing.
[187:27.90]Hot and spicy.
[187:29.24]Spicy.
[187:44.22]Don't jump.
[187:45.16]I have eight rewinds.
[187:46.38]I'm going to be fine.
[187:49.75]Alright, cool.
[187:58.75]Do it.
[188:03.23]Nice house, dude.
[188:03.79]Thanks, man.
[188:05.47]Did you see how many gifted subs there were today?
[188:08.95]Went immediately out and bought this.
[188:15.60]I don't think I can do anything.
[188:16.66]Is that a bathtub?
[188:19.30]The bathtub is weird looking.
[188:20.22]Alright, let's go.
[188:28.37]Look at all these points that are all over my house.
[188:31.41]Health bar increased.
[188:35.78]That's kind of insane.
[188:37.80]You gotta be kidding me.
[188:38.54]This is free.
[188:50.71]Now that's what I call good game design.
[188:52.47]Yeah, who's gonna climb on the roof of their house?
[188:55.51]I don't know very many people that would do that.
[189:01.61]Come down to the next level here.
[189:06.62]I'm not dead.
[189:08.16]Is this gonna kill me?
[189:13.93]Nope, I don't even need to do that!
[189:23.08]Up here, got it.
[189:26.80]One more.
[189:33.26]They gave me a lot of these.
[189:34.18]Can I grab it from here?
[189:34.94]Come on, Reach!
[189:35.74]Put your hand up!
[189:37.76]Oh well.
[189:38.74]I don't want it.
[189:43.25]Did they stop?
[189:47.89]The guy just played like a Happy Meal song.
[189:49.67]What was that?
[190:04.45]Now get out of the car, dickhead.
[190:11.24]Lightning Rider, with another 10 community gifted subscriptions.
[190:17.41]Thank you so much, Lightning.
[190:20.51]Giving away the subs.
[190:21.21]10 of them.
[190:23.47]Adding to the massive amount given today.
[190:25.11]That guy's a gun.
[190:29.92]Thank you so much, Lightning.
[190:33.89]This guy could fight back.
[190:36.34]I'm gonna need my partner now.
[190:39.32]Nope.
[190:44.96]Now what can I do for you?
[190:49.93]I know you.
[190:50.67]You need to score at least 1500 points to complete this challenge.
[190:55.81]Okay.
[191:03.91]Find the tequila cellar.
[191:08.85]Wait, he's alive.
[191:15.70]What was that?
[191:16.40]He was there.
[191:16.90]You saw him.
[191:35.11]Kill the bandits.
[191:39.99]I think I took a wrong turn.
[191:45.47]Yep.
[191:56.56]Right here.
[192:02.24]What's the bikini do?
[192:07.15]What did that do?
[192:09.17]That didn't do anything.
[192:11.95]Who's the guy with the bat?
[192:41.57]Oh, it summons a luchador.
[192:42.99]Okay.
[192:53.44]He just swings his bat.
[192:54.50]7 out of 10.
[192:57.58]They attracted to it, right?
[193:09.40]They were waiting outs.
[193:10.70]Find the guy who set you up and kill him.
[193:23.86]I can do that.
[193:24.87]Let's go.
[193:32.07]Unfortunately, after this mission, I think I have to go.
[193:42.65]I'm not even... I'm not even kidding.
[193:48.28]I'm getting... I'm getting the puke tingles inside of my face.
[193:51.02]Is he trying to kill me?
[193:54.84]Is he gonna run me down?
[194:06.69]Stop walking!
[194:07.27]Stop walking!
[194:07.83]Stop walking!
[194:08.39]Rewind!
[194:08.77]Rewind!
[194:09.15]Rewind it!
[194:11.65]Oh, don't put these down.
[194:18.77]Put them down.
[194:19.23]Put them down.
[194:19.67]Put them down.
[194:23.65]Get in the car.
[194:32.12]He's not away.
[194:32.62]I got him.
[194:43.42]Don't ever set me up again.
[194:48.97]He was parked.
[194:51.03]Oh, God damn it.
[194:51.77]I'm battling this buffalo chicken pizza slice that I ate.
[194:58.19]I should have just ate the salad.
[195:00.38]There was a salad I could have made that was right next to it.
[195:04.16]But I was like, oh, buffalo chicken pizza.
[195:06.04]Raggy.
[195:22.49]You ate four-day-old buffalo chicken pizza from the fridge.
[195:26.10]Yes.
[195:30.50]Four days is fine.
[195:31.42]That's like... But I... I've eaten it before.
[195:34.75]My cholesterol.
[195:37.91]It doesn't... There was a whole... It was a piece of pizza.
[195:39.87]That's it.
[195:40.11]It was just one piece of pizza.
[195:54.97]Okay.
[195:57.89]Never doing that again.
[195:58.55]Alright.
[196:05.13]Thank you for watching, everybody.
[196:09.66]I have to actually leave.
[196:10.62]Oh, my God.
[196:11.78]What a disaster.
[196:14.62]Well, I mean, at least I streamed for like three and a half hours.
[196:16.82]I'm okay with that.
[196:17.75]We'll read the bits.
[196:19.09]That should get us to about four or five.
[196:20.93]Tomorrow, we're building the Labo drunk.
[196:23.71]So, yeah, funny, like, LOL, laugh out loud guy drinks stream.
[196:28.19]I can't wait.
[196:32.70]Five more subs from Lightning Rider.
[196:39.26]Lightning Rider, thank you so much, dude.
[196:40.52]That's a huge amount of subscriptions.
[196:44.60]Thank you, everybody.
[196:45.24]We're going to see how many were here.
[196:46.66]It's going to be a lot.
[196:52.54]I'll see you guys tomorrow if you've just taken off Labo.
[196:56.35]We're building the robot.
[196:58.01]I'm going to try to build the whole thing in one stream.
[196:59.85]We'll see how it goes.
[197:01.89]Hopefully I can puke and just get this out of here.
[197:03.81]It's alright.
[197:04.57]I'm just going to get rid of the bad stuff and then I'll put it in the salad.
[197:07.35]Let me replace it.
[197:09.11]I'm just going to replace the food that's in my stomach.
[197:13.65]I'm returning my food, right?
[197:15.97]And then I'm going to replace it.
[197:17.51]I'm going to exchange it for the salad.
[197:22.84]So many subs.
[197:27.20]But, yeah, I need to kind of go.
[197:31.14]It's really creeping up on me here.
[197:35.52]MGSFan gave six subs at the end here.
[197:44.52]Joe, hopefully you didn't hear that.
[197:47.55]Thank you, MGS fan, for the six subs.
[197:53.53]We did.
[197:57.62]Alright.
[197:58.58]Let's do the subs.
[197:59.52]Let's see.
[198:00.22]I'm curious.
[198:01.72]It's going to be a long list.
[198:03.88]I'm ready.
[198:05.26]Here we go.
[198:07.25]Thank you so much, everybody.
[198:09.43]Oh, my God!
[198:10.91]Thank you, uh, Annalander, Kale, Mr. Squishy, Dan, Moog, uh, Hup, Sebix.
[198:16.36]Oh, there's no way I'm gonna be able to do this.
[198:18.16]Atrus, the Odor, Zonny, Verilick, Sarge, Funky Taco, Splud.
[198:22.66]This section of people.
[198:24.16]This section of people.
[198:25.64]Thank you, all you guys here.
[198:27.61]Everybody here.
[198:29.99]All these people.
[198:32.59]Thank you everybody on this list.
[198:34.91]All of you are so fucking sweet to me and nice to me.
[198:38.85]And you've all done a really great thing.
[198:40.57]You've subbed to me and I appreciate every ounce of it.
[198:42.74]This is so many.
[198:48.33]This is an infinite list.
[198:49.33]This is the fastest it's ever gone.
[198:50.85]And I increased it.
[198:52.37]I increased it.
[198:52.87]I went into the stream lab settings and I made this as long as it can be for the time limit.
[198:57.61]You have to be on a certain time limit.
[198:58.81]I made it off the full bar.
[199:02.83]Look at this.
[199:03.15]Look at this huge amount of people.
[199:06.51]This is probably going to be more than a couple hundred people.
[199:11.21]Thank you so much.
[199:12.81]And the people that didn't just get randomly subbed.
[199:16.65]Everybody as well on this list that has subbed just because they wanted to.
[199:20.77]Thank you.
[199:24.33]Greedy megalomaniac.
[199:30.25]Wow.
[199:31.27]This is unbelievable.
[199:36.27]How many years are in this list?
[199:37.69]There's a lot of names here.
[199:45.20]Wow.
[199:47.38]Oh my god.
[199:48.89]This is actually ridiculous.
[199:55.35]I have to be at all-time high for subs now.
[199:58.41]Have to be.
[200:06.80]Even Nightbot got a sub.
[200:11.36]Here come new emotes.
[200:16.28]It's still going.
[200:20.94]It's still going.
[200:22.92]I'm not sure there's an end in sight here.
[200:24.34]I think this is going to keep going for the next five minutes.
[200:35.69]It blows my mind.
[200:37.19]Each one of these subscriptions is a person in this chat.
[200:42.07]It's all $5 per month to me
[200:48.62]I don't even know what to say.
[200:49.60]Like, this is unbelievable.
[200:57.51]Dermot, why are you so hard on yourself?
[200:59.75]You shouldn't be so harsh on yourself.
[201:01.01]It's because of this.
[201:08.69]That's a lot of fucking money.
[201:13.62]It better be worth it.
[201:18.55]Thank you.
[201:23.57]You guys are awesome.
[201:26.22]I just subbed for the meme.
[201:33.76]And I will see you guys tomorrow.
[201:36.56]All those 500 people that just got subscribed to the channel.
[201:42.93]Let's get through the bits.
[201:46.39]Goddamn.
[201:50.90]You guys are something else.
[201:52.98]For real.
[201:55.38]See you, all you guys that are leaving.
[201:57.32]See you tomorrow.
[201:58.99]Tomorrow night.
[202:00.53]We'll have a few drinks.
[202:01.27]We'll build the robot.
[202:03.41]Should be a nice little chill, fun stream.
[202:06.05]I hope it is.
[202:07.89]I promise not to break anything.
[202:12.39]But, on another note, thank you to PeterP337R for the $1 donation.

[202:57.74]That's it.
[202:58.18]And by the way, you don't have to say anything else.
[203:01.02]You want to really impress the people at the table, at the bar?
[203:04.44]Do you be like, oh, you know, I do a pretty good Joe Swanson.
[203:07.20]Like, do you?
[203:07.64]Yeah, I've been working on it.
[203:09.15]Just say, in a low voice, B-E-E-T-E-R.
[203:15.03]Beater.
[203:15.99]The whole table will go, whoa!
[203:18.40]Whoa!
[203:19.72]You should get into acting!
[203:21.42]You should get into screenwriting!
[203:24.17]The whole table will be fucking impressed.
[203:28.51]Take it from me.
[203:29.27]I've used it like 25 times.
[203:30.73]But anyways, I decide on the games I play based on... I just scroll through, I look them up, and if it looks like something that I think I'd want to play on stream, I do it.
[203:47.75]You should get into acting.
[203:55.07]Ha ha.
[204:02.74]Thank you so much again to Berry Rice.
[204:07.48]Berry Reese.
[204:10.28]Ha ha hee hee.
[204:19.61]Oh, you guys.
[204:21.81]With the ha-has.
[204:22.79]Look at you guys.
[204:23.89]Look at that.
[204:24.53]Look at that.
[204:25.15]You guys are laughing at the thing I just did.
[204:28.39]I told you that before, right?
[204:29.37]I don't have better twitch.tv.
[204:32.02]You guys know that I've always... Well, not always.
[204:34.48]Up until about a year ago, I thought that that was people actually laughing at jokes and stuff.
[204:39.14]Like, they were like... I didn't think that that was actually like a... Wow, I didn't think that was funny.
[204:43.94]You're a loser.
[204:45.35]I thought there were people thinking it was funny.
[204:59.18]I'd make a reference or a shitty joke and I'd look over and be like, oh, wow, that really, I really knocked it out of the park, huh?
[205:05.49]A year, probably not that long, maybe like six months went by and I finally figured it out that there was another, there's another little third party source where you could have emotes.
[205:14.93]I didn't even know that existed until like six to seven months into streaming.
[205:32.95]but anyways uh thank you to trump uh thank you to trump richie trump tritchie oh trump no trumpet rich trumpet richie thank you for the one dollar hey jerma thank you for all the laughs and making my life a little better thank you uh trumpet
[205:58.72]No, don't you- Listen, don't you- I told you guys this before.
[206:01.50]There's no capitalization in Streamlabs.
[206:04.98]So, it's just an all lowercase.
[206:07.24]T-R-U-M-P-E-T-R-I-C-H-I-E.
[206:11.77]Right?
[206:12.87]There's no capitals.
[206:14.29]The name might have capitals, but there's no capitals over here on Streamlabs.
[206:20.39]So, names just kind of blend together sometimes.
[206:24.92]Capitalist.
[206:26.06]No!
[206:26.40]Capital letters!
[206:27.44]Capital letters!
[206:35.84]capitalism trump the streamer you know like whatever you're gonna say about trump like I like that we're not talking politics here but like doesn't he seem like the type that would stream like Fortnite for no reason just because he felt like it like he would just turn it on right and just be like at like four o'clock in the morning with like no shirt on
[207:06.36]And then people the next day would be like, what the fuck was that?
[207:09.52]Why did he do that?
[207:10.20]What the fuck was he doing?
[207:14.23]Doesn't he seem like the kind of type?
[207:15.39]He seems like the type, doesn't he?
[207:27.45]No, we're not talking politics.
[207:32.88]I'm just saying.
[207:36.07]That's it.
[207:36.91]I'm not talking about his policy.
[207:38.42]I'm not talking about other policy.
[207:40.14]This is no policy.
[207:41.72]Politics zone.
[207:45.34]I just said that wouldn't it be funny if the president played Fortnite at 4 a.m.
[207:50.56]That's all I said.
[207:57.83]I didn't say anything else.
[208:04.57]Hey guys, wouldn't it be funny?
[208:05.82]Haha.
[208:15.76]That's it.
[208:17.11]Alright, you want to give me this shit here?
[208:18.85]Alright, the next 30 streams are going to be me playing Fortnite silent with a webcam on.
[208:24.95]We're doing that for the next 30 streams in a row.
[208:30.26]I want to see an apology here.
[208:33.10]I want to see collectively chat spell out in collectively do it per letter.
[208:39.51]Jeremy, we are so sorry that we gave you that much stress about the whole politics thing that you didn't do.
[208:45.61]I'd like to say I want to see it.
[208:54.33]Jeremy, we are so sorry.
[208:59.94]For giving you the stress of the politics that you did not do.
[209:10.52]Okay.
[209:11.65]I forgive you guys.
[209:12.31]Thanks, guys.
[209:14.43]That was actually pretty impressive.
[209:15.33]You guys really nailed it.
[209:16.73]I didn't think you guys were gonna be able to do it.
[209:19.71]Thanks, guys.
[209:20.13]I appreciate that.
[209:25.61]Anyways, thank you to...

[209:52.17]Tons of it.
[209:57.15]Tonight was a large money stream.
[210:02.68]thank you uh cad btv thanks for the five dollars hey jerma how you doing today buddy I'm doing pretty good although my stomach is really bothering me because I ate an old piece of pizza in the fridge and I need to go like lie down on my back on the ground you know sometimes you just gotta lie down on a wood floor I'm gonna do that for about 30 minutes
[210:33.13]Some of you guys get it.
[210:34.99]It's an old joke.
[210:35.91]No, it's not.
[210:37.22]I'm making a reference to stuff that I do.
[210:38.82]I'm not making a joke there.
[210:40.28]I actually lie on the fucking floor when I don't feel good.
[210:44.68]It has to be hardwood.
[210:47.68]Are you a Sims character?
[210:53.34]It's not a joke.
[210:54.97]I actually do that.
[211:07.41]We should play The Sims on stream one day.
[211:10.69]And not, like, LOL drown them in the pool.
[211:13.61]Like, actually play it.
[211:14.87]And try to win.
[211:17.35]You know how you win The Sims?
[211:18.18]You get a bunch of money.
[211:20.26]You have to have 100 million simoleon bucks.
[211:22.90]Whatever they're called.
[211:23.54]What are they called?
[211:24.28]Similins?
[211:26.90]The simi... The similarian?
[211:31.36]No, that's the Lord of the Rings book.
[211:32.88]What am I thinking of?
[211:37.97]What are they called?
[211:44.13]The Simerilians.
[211:45.33]Simerilians.
[211:46.31]No, that's the Lord of the Rings book.
[211:48.74]Simoleons.
[211:55.78]The Simpsons.
[211:59.08]Simoleons.
[212:02.40]How would you make that that difficult to say?
[212:05.94]But you can't make it like sim bucks or like bucks or something like V bucks Because it's a video.
[212:13.07]It's a video game and they're bucks.
[212:14.59]It's very easy Hey, thank you to Sticks renegade for the one dollar can't watch tonight.
[212:26.54]We'll watch the VOD.
[212:27.30]But here's a stream suggestion
[212:29.54]Since your art skills are top-notch, buy the book 64-642 Things to Draw and draw all 642 things.
[212:38.59]That might take a few years.
[212:41.83]But I will actually, I'm curious what that is.
[212:44.69]I'll look it up.
[212:50.86]Thank you Horace2 for the $5, Horace.
[212:53.36]Hey Jeremiah, I remember finding your videos near the beginning of middle school.
[212:55.92]Now I'm heading off to college tomorrow.
[212:59.10]It isn't much, but I wanted to show my appreciation for my number one top 1000 streamer for over six years of classic comedy, jermaHeart.
[213:07.84]Thank you.
[213:10.14]Appreciate it.
[213:12.21]Yeah, those of you guys that may be fairly new, I have been doing this online thing for like seven years now.
[213:24.06]I was on YouTube for about four years.
[213:27.58]And then have been predominantly on Twitch for about two and a half, right?
[213:33.20]Maybe three.
[213:33.64]I think you all know that already, but maybe like two people in here don't.
[213:42.35]That's like, yeah, that's like 5,000 seconds.
[213:43.91]That's a long time.
[213:46.67]But thank you, dude.
[213:47.23]Thank you, Anomalint, for the one dollar here.
[213:50.13]Thank you, Anomalint.
[213:52.61]I just got my one-year sub badge, so I wanted to donate big for the occasion.
[213:57.19]But some guy knocked on my door today with a baseball bat and robbed me of all my money.
[214:01.69]All I had left was what I stashed away inside of a rat hole for safekeeping.
[214:06.62]I think the guy's name was College or something like that.
[214:09.74]Seriously, though, thanks for all the laughs, Jerma, this past year, and good luck on your move.
[214:14.96]Thanks, dude.
[214:15.64]That was pretty good.
[214:20.57]College is expensive.
[214:23.76]For some reason.
[214:26.83]You know?
[214:27.13]Isn't that interesting?
[214:30.81]I have an idea.
[214:32.71]Let's make something that's a fucking requirement for all these young people.
[214:37.40]Let's have it be like four times the average American income.
[214:41.30]Isn't that interesting?
[214:50.39]Oh, and by the way, when you get out of college and you owe like $240,000 and you get an entry-level job, that's like 30 grand a year.
[214:59.99]You'll owe us money for life, motherfucker.
[215:02.11]That's not a political comment.
[215:08.03]That's just a... What are you talking about?
[215:10.61]That's not politics.
[215:12.85]That's not that that's me.
[215:13.51]That's talking about school.
[215:14.53]That's talking about school.
[215:15.68]Isn't that interesting?
[215:25.93]That's a social issue, but it's not a political issue.
[215:28.68]I mean, it is, but it isn't.
[215:31.40]Guys, you guys know my stance.
[215:39.94]You socialist.
[215:40.85]I'm not a socialist.
[215:43.87]What?
[215:49.73]I trade cryptocurrencies.
[215:51.67]You think I'm a socialist?
[216:02.90]Hey, and another thing.
[216:05.12]No, I'm just kidding.
[216:10.01]How's crypto working out for you?
[216:11.23]Eh, not so good.
[216:12.47]Not so good.
[216:12.95]Not right now.
[216:14.45]You know, it's, uh... Oh, that's like... Hear ye, hear ye.
[216:19.90]It is I, Jerbo the Horseback Rider.
[216:21.96]Alright, let's go.
[216:22.80]We're moving on.
[216:24.62]P337R for the free box.
[216:26.92]Thanks a lot.
[216:27.40]Man, he's this cool guy.
[216:28.26]Cool guy.
[216:37.02]I'm trying to, like, get everybody.
[216:38.08]Wait, don't talk about politics on the stream.
[216:44.97]Look, as somebody, I'm just speaking from a personal experience.
[216:49.38]No politics.
[216:50.82]That's not what we're talking about.
[216:51.84]We're talking personal experience.
[216:53.88]I went to college.
[216:55.52]I owed a lot of fucking money.
[216:57.44]And I still owe it.
[216:58.94]I still have to pay it back.
[217:00.40]And I'm 32 turning 33.
[217:02.82]It's just a personal like WTF situation that I think like, what the fuck, dude?
[217:08.27]What the fuck, mate?
[217:14.79]What did I study?
[217:15.19]Communication.
[217:16.83]Film, TV, radio.
[217:21.44]You paid off my college this stream.
[217:29.18]You studied to become a streamer.
[217:32.68]No, no, no.
[217:33.76]I mean, that was kind of part of... No, no, streaming didn't exist back then.
[217:39.32]It was like audio recording, mass media, public relations, that kind of stuff.
[217:44.98]Some film classes here and there.
[217:46.22]There's a lot of mass media.
[217:53.13]I majored in communication.
[217:57.81]I got the Twitch degree.
[218:00.17]Yes, guys, I'm a streamer and I have a certified streamer degree.
[218:03.36]So, you know, you can trust me.
[218:17.87]fuck you're old come on I'm just speaking from personal experience and yes a lot of it I'm just tongue-in-cheek making references but as a wise man once said isn't that interesting huh hey kristen thanks for the one dollar and 11 cents pronounced kristen got it right I don't like this game much sorry sorry about that
[218:43.53]Still watching the whole stream, though.
[218:44.81]Thank you for making these bad games interesting.
[218:47.13]Cool guy.
[218:48.39]I'm truly excited for Labo tomorrow.
[218:50.13]No joke.
[218:50.59]Don't forget the cooking wine.
[218:56.36]Is the wise man you?
[218:59.58]I'm happy you think that way.
[219:02.72]Thank you.
[219:05.66]I can be president in a few years.
[219:08.45]Yeah, I'll get like 1,500 votes, the people in this chat.
[219:12.90]If I ever ran for office, it would be impossible for me to win.
[219:15.24]You understand that, right?
[219:16.94]It doesn't matter how good my policies were and how sound my reasoning and how sound my policies would be.
[219:23.27]All my opponent would have to do is pull up a clip where I said I was going to suck a fart out of somebody's ass and I would lose.
[219:31.53]No matter what.
[219:34.24]They would just go to a clip of me fucking screaming and like throwing the piano labo across the room.
[219:39.38]Nobody would vote for me.
[219:43.85]There's images of my face.
[219:45.61]If you just type in my fucking name, like Jerma, whatever on... The first image is like a terrifying, awful, like I will not vote for that guy face.
[219:57.22]They're like the first four of them are like that.
[220:12.46]yeah like you think I'm gonna win the presidency I will tell you though if I did win the presidency my presidential portrait would be one of those Google images the first Google image right let's okay I'm gonna type in Jerma and go to image search
[220:37.43]I'll prove it.
[220:38.99]Jerma.
[220:40.31]Images.
[220:41.29]Isn't that funny?
[220:42.99]Look at the first fucking image.
[220:48.85]Okay.
[220:50.31]By the way, these first three images could be in the same sequence.
[220:55.47]Image number six is great, too.
[220:56.77]That's like a crazy guy holding a bat.
[221:03.37]Okay, scroll through these images.
[221:05.99]And I'd like you to tell me, find more than three that you would not be scared of the guy.
[221:16.32]There are probably two or three normal images in here.
[221:20.40]The rest are like, I'm scared of this person.
[221:29.26]Did he just Google himself?
[221:30.31]What a megalomaniac.
[221:32.28]No, I'm making a point about how no one would vote for me because this first fucking image you see is this, like, scary one.
[221:43.65]Whatever.
[221:44.79]Point is, yes, in a couple years I would be able to run for president.
[221:52.34]Should I just be the guy that... Who's that guy that runs that puts a boot on his head?
[221:56.30]And, like, puts bees into the room and, like, throws confetti at people?
[221:59.88]He does it every single four years?
[222:02.64]Vermin Supreme, yeah.
[222:05.33]Why does that guy not have, like, a YouTube channel?
[222:06.89]He would be famous if he did.
[222:10.61]That guy was way ahead of his time, man.
[222:12.09]If he had, like, made a YouTube channel, Vermin Supreme, back in, like, 2000, he'd be playing Fortnite right now.
[222:19.92]With, like, 500,000 subs.
[222:32.85]But anyways.
[222:35.09]Thank you froggiest broom for the $1.50.
[222:37.11]Will you ever watch the Fred movies on stream?
[222:41.25]100%.
[222:41.27]100%.
[222:41.59]No.
[222:45.31]It absolutely will never happen.
[222:52.35]You know how people say, like, oh, clip me saying this, screenshot me saying this, okay?
[222:56.89]Because there's no way this will ever work.
[222:58.68]This will never happen.

[224:16.36]Hello, Jeremy.
[224:16.94]Long time no watch.
[224:18.48]Ever since the empty apartment below mine caught fire and changed the texture of all the wiring everywhere to perfectly cooked pasta.
[224:26.88]P.S.

[225:04.68]Thank you, WireTM.
[225:07.21]Thank you, Captain of the Nevermind.
[225:13.33]Captain of the Nevermind for the $10.
[225:17.32]It's your email.
[225:18.96]Yes, I am still feeling pukish.
[225:20.30]It's not going away.
[225:21.82]I can do this.
[225:22.38]I just can't concentrate on playing a game right now.
[225:26.27]Thank you, Captain of the Nevermind, for the 10 bucks.
[225:27.85]Hey, Jeremy, don't know if you've seen this before, but I figured I'd send it.
[225:30.89]It's a Reddit post from a few days ago.
[225:33.35]It's a really touching letter and I wanted to make sure you see it.
[225:36.85]It's very personal, so I think you should read it off stream.
[225:39.79]Thanks for all the great content.
[225:40.97]Keep up the streams and have a good move.
[225:43.88]+2.
[225:46.44]Thank you, Captain of the Nevermind.
[225:48.08]I have already read it.
[225:50.96]I know exactly what you were talking about.
[225:53.36]I've already read it.
[225:53.98]So...
[225:56.24]Yes.
[225:56.76]It was very, very, very, very touching.
[226:03.43]Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
[226:06.87]Ah, yes, I have seen it.
[226:08.87]I've already read it.
[226:09.93]Yes.
[226:16.50]Yes.
[226:18.18]Personal equals post on Reddit.
[226:20.20]Does not equal.
[226:20.78]What do you mean?
[226:28.02]Why are all the clips on your trending clips page for a channel called... Are you trying to do like the joke thing where I read the word?
[226:45.27]Yeah, that's one of those things I think.
[226:46.45]I'm not saying it.
[226:50.90]Bank of fucking America!
[226:53.04]Bank of America!
[227:02.37]They are, yeah, they are.
[227:03.73]Look at it.
[227:07.29]I'm right.
[227:09.43]It really is for another person's channel.
[227:13.77]My trending clips.
[227:15.13]Hold on.
[227:15.53]Wait, wait.
[227:16.61]Go to my trending clips.
[227:20.27]I don't know how to get there.
[227:21.35]Alright, clips.
[227:24.72]How do I do that?
[227:33.14]I don't even know where to go to do that Drop down box on the top left Which for legal reasons I can't say is bad I don't use Twitch Trending clips of me Political what?
[228:00.41]Videos you may like, clips you may like, trending Hearthstone streamers you may like, Fortnite streamers you may like.
[228:14.74]Okay, trending page, trending.
[228:22.71]Okay, hold on, trending for... Who the fuck is this?
[228:32.26]Wait a second.
[228:33.30]This is under trending from my channel.
[228:43.61]I have no idea what this is.
[228:48.21]What about top 24 hours?
[228:50.45]Okay.
[228:51.67]Top seven days.
[228:53.01]Okay, trending.
[228:59.43]Top all time.
[229:01.76]Everything works but trending.
[229:04.52]Are we sure this guy's not like super famous and trending all over the world or something?
[229:14.43]Show us.
[229:14.91]Yeah, just click it.
[229:15.89]You can see for yourself.
[229:28.46]This is probably like a bug.
[229:38.28]Yeah, this is probably like a Twitch bug.
[229:39.76]I don't think there's anything wrong or bad about this.
[229:44.22]Yeah, this is probably like... Okay, you guys remember... Do you remember... Remember back when Steam had that problem?
[230:03.65]Where it logged you in as a different person?
[230:08.91]Remember how fucked up that was?
[230:10.09]That was the weirdest thing ever.
[230:18.69]I'm assuming this is probably one of those cases where it's just pulling from the wrong API or something.
[230:25.53]It was during like the winter sale a couple years ago, yeah?
[230:28.86]You would open up your page and not even be logged out.
[230:31.02]You were logged in as yourself, you went to a store page, and you were logged in as a different person.
[230:40.50]It was really weird.
[230:47.01]That's my account.
[230:49.01]But yeah, that's weird, I guess.
[230:54.79]I'm sure he's a nice guy.
[230:55.63]I have no idea who he is.
[230:58.61]But... Yeah, pulled all your purchase history.
[231:01.61]Yeah, it was really not cool.
[231:04.15]Steam gets away with a lot of fucked up shit, don't they?
[231:07.82]Think about it.
[231:11.04]Think about all the weird, bad shit that Steam has kind of gotten away with.
[231:16.50]Huh.
[231:21.08]An ITI, huh?
[231:24.98]ITI.
[231:36.61]But let's keep going.
[231:38.91]Uh, political.
[231:43.99]What's the music doing?
[231:44.95]What's wrong with the music?
[231:52.56]You keep telling people not to use clients like Steam and Origin, and they keep doing it.
[231:56.28]Well, if you're a PC gamer, you kind of have to have Steam.
[232:02.86]Very few game companies sell Direct anymore.
[232:07.19]And the ones that do are multiplayer MOBAs.
[232:11.67]And...
[232:14.11]PUBG games.
[232:15.83]There's not a whole lot of games that aren't... They don't do Direct anymore.
[232:19.41]You can't buy a game at GameStop anymore.
[232:23.12]They've liquidated all retail PC.
[232:25.84]It doesn't exist anymore.
[232:37.67]Multiplayer Mobus.
[232:38.89]PogChamp.
[232:44.40]If you try and use a CD in a modern computer, it explodes.
[232:48.16]I don't believe that.
[232:49.66]In fact, why would I even read that message in chat?
[232:53.58]Like, I knew that it was not real, but I read it out loud.
[232:58.27]There was no reason for me to read that.
[233:00.81]Test it, it's true.
[233:02.27]It's not true.
[233:07.45]What happens to all your games if Steam shuts down?
[233:10.35]I think there's probably way more problems to deal with if Steam were to shut down.
[233:15.27]I think the whole industry would be under a lot of problems and pressure if something like that happened.
[233:21.84]If Steam were to shut off and turn off forever, look out your window, and there'd probably be a fireball in the sky.
[233:30.92]That's not possible.
[233:37.67]Fireball in the eye.
[233:38.63]The sun.
[233:41.27]Yeah, the sun would be crashing to Earth at that point.
[233:46.60]You would just look out your window and it would just be red.
[233:50.27]Why is Steam not working?
[233:51.43]Hold on.
[233:52.23]Let me go to Reddit.

[236:54.11]Thank you, though.
[236:55.63]Chubby Funster, thanks for the $1.
[236:57.02]Hi, Jerma.
[236:57.66]I know this is a little late, but Lazy Luke drew this during the Hornet disaster, and I just wanted to share it with you.
[237:03.56]Keep up the great streams and being a mega cutie.
[237:11.90]Let's take a look.
[237:14.66]I love how you made me look.
[237:17.87]Just absolutely dashing in this photo.
[237:22.63]I'm fucking huge.
[237:24.61]I got this flowing Fabio hair.
[237:28.49]I got a huge left arm.
[237:32.11]My left arm is bigger than my right.
[237:33.33]You're very perceptive.
[237:34.21]It is.
[237:38.90]Thank you for that.
[237:41.55]You're on the right, though.
[237:44.02]So who's on the left in this scenario?
[237:47.36]Who's that on the left?
[237:55.81]The Hornet.
[237:57.43]Oh, my fucking god.
[237:59.85]Thank you, Chubby Funster, and thank you to Lazy Luke for the drawing.
[238:04.54]Mr. Celsius, thanks for the $1 of me.
[238:08.48]That's my favorite Seinfeld opening.
[238:09.90]Of course it is.
[238:10.52]It's my favorite too.
[238:12.26]Vertical, thanks for the $1.
[238:13.96]I had a box of pita chips that I was going to eat when you yelled, don't eat all the chips when you jumped out of the truck.
[238:20.41]So now I have no choice but to put these away and just drink water.
[238:23.23]Well, that's much more healthy for you.
[238:25.49]There's too much oil and salt on those chips.
[238:30.61]Water is what you should have drank.
[238:32.03]I'm glad you did.
[238:34.42]Hey Diddy Dong, thanks for the $5, Mr. Destructoid.
[238:38.24]Thank you, Diddy Dong, for the $5.
[238:41.62]Hallsback, thanks for the $1.
[238:43.23]Holy macaroni, Jerma.
[238:45.15]I love this game.
[238:49.07]This is a very fun, crazy game.
[238:55.85]Hey Scripps3, thanks for the $1.
[238:57.47]Here's a Wasp video.
[239:00.65]Okay.
[239:06.37]Let's see, we have to play every single one of these I get.
[239:08.95]Taste that, and here we go.
[239:21.77]So I think the thing about, I think eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[239:29.31]Oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, hold on.
[239:32.96]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[239:36.29]Okay, he landed.
[239:44.13]Thanks a lot.
[239:47.72]Thank you, uh, for the, thank you, Script3, for the one dollar.
[239:51.72]Hey, Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the one dollar.
[239:54.90]Garfield the mod over here.
[239:59.04]No, I gave it to you for five seconds, and then took it away.
[240:04.11]I wanted to thank you for modding me for three seconds last stream.
[240:06.37]It made your buddy Garf feel like a million bucks.
[240:09.39]What would my credentials for mod be, though?
[240:11.64]Writing funny memes in chat?
[240:13.14]Talking about Odie's day?
[240:14.38]I feel like giving Garf so much power is a crazy move.
[240:17.00]It is.
[240:18.42]But if Garfield can't be mod, can I at least be the stream's cat ambassador?
[240:22.92]I'll be a good addition to feline relations.
[240:24.61]You can count on Garf.
[240:34.06]yeah feline relations you are now the cat feline ambassador garfield of the Jerma985 channel and for your first piece of duty they've got a very important task for you there's a place on an island there's a a map on an island in the middle of nowhere out in the over the coast of the pacific ocean
[241:02.49]Get out there, and I heard there's some cats that may have been seen there, and there's a map there.
[241:08.45]It's probably going to take you, like, months to figure this out, but you are the cat ambassador.
[241:12.56]You've got to get out there and do a lot of investigation and probably put your mind to it and stay out there and really get the data that's required to bring back to me as cat ambassador.
[241:32.90]He's a bully.
[241:33.98]No, I'm just kidding.
[241:36.36]I'm kidding.
[241:37.04]I'm kidding.
[241:47.31]I'm not being a bully.
[241:50.47]Hey, they said, Garfield said he wanted to be a cat ambassador for the channel.
[241:54.91]And I don't know, I want to go find some cats.
[242:01.02]Mean I'm not being mean I'm being I'm giving a quest I Don't even like cats oh My god guys, that's a Jew that's also a joke.
[242:18.93]I fucking love cats.
[242:20.27]I've had a cat in my life forever I Love an iPad.
[242:25.04]I pat them on the head.
[242:26.28]I
[242:28.47]I love when they shit in my house.
[242:31.50]I love when they go to the bathroom in the house and you have to pick out the shit with your hands.
[242:37.00]I love it.
[242:38.64]They have a box in your house and the whole entire area of where that box is, it doesn't matter where it is, put it in a fucking goddamn boiler room for all that matters.
[242:47.77]About one mile radius in your house is going to smell like cat shit.
[243:00.22]Get a scooper.
[243:01.00]That's what I mean by hands.
[243:02.28]And then you put it in a bag.
[243:04.60]You wrap up the bag and put the bag in the trash.
[243:08.72]And then all of a sudden you come back home from a hard day's work and you come in the goddamn door and you go, what the fuck is that?
[243:13.95]That cat shit I smell?
[243:29.75]It's too late for this.
[243:36.98]Now, for all the people that think this is a serious conversation, you'd be sorely mistaken.
[243:47.68]I love cats.
[243:48.15]I love dogs.
[243:49.17]I love rats.
[243:50.83]I love lizards.
[243:52.35]I love all animals.
[243:54.41]I've owned quite a few of these.
[244:05.25]I actually did want to get a rat.
[244:07.49]There were two rats at my local pet store.
[244:11.82]They were so cute.
[244:13.62]They really were.
[244:14.58]They were so smart too.
[244:16.16]You know you can teach rats their names and they listen?
[244:24.84]Yeah, that's the one reason why I don't think I'd be able to have a rat.
[244:28.81]Because they're so cute and they're so interesting and they're so funny.
[244:32.53]They only live for like a year or two.
[244:35.67]I would just barely start to get super attached and then they would be gone.
[244:40.23]That's like the one problem.
[244:47.89]They don't last very long.
[244:52.43]And yes, they are insanely cheap.
[244:58.69]I think it's like $6 to buy a rat.
[245:07.68]Here for a good time, not a long time.
[245:16.06]Go get one.
[245:21.40]No, I can't.
[245:22.32]I can't.
[245:24.22]They got too many animals to deal with.
[245:26.91]I got a dog.
[245:27.57]There's a cat.
[245:31.07]I just can't add another animal to my life.
[245:37.15]You have us.
[245:37.91]You guys are not... What?
[245:39.86]My animals?
[245:42.08]What do you mean you have us?
[245:46.76]What are you talking about?
[245:53.75]Put him in the Labo house?
[245:55.97]That would be so cute.
[245:58.15]For like a little photo shoot.
[245:59.59]Get him in the Labo house and put him in like a Super Mario hat and get retweeted by Nintendo.
[246:04.35]Guaranteed.
[246:14.87]But no, cats... I like how weird cats are.
[246:18.37]Cats are devilishly strange.
[246:20.31]They're so weird and so... They have a lot of personality.
[246:26.42]But besides that, let's move on.
[246:27.86]Let's be real now.
[246:31.78]Thank you, Garfield.
[246:32.72]No, Garfield, you can be the cat ambassador.
[246:34.40]For all cat-related questions, please refer to Garfield.
[246:41.34]Thank you so much, Garfield, again, for the dollar.
[246:43.49]Appreciate it.
[246:45.57]Hope you have a great day.
[246:48.59]Eves, thanks for the $1.
[246:50.47]I've given you lots of money.
[246:51.59]Here's more.
[246:53.03]I love you.
[246:53.47]Make sure you watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[246:57.68]On Twitch.
[246:59.40]I can't do it on Twitch.
[247:04.36]How do I get my cat out of this tree?
[247:07.32]Oh, God.
[247:08.89]Come to me.
[247:10.98]Garfield, you may have just allowed a lot of unsolicited private messages.
[247:21.80]Rafmouse, thanks for the $1.
[247:23.00]Jeremy, you're aware that this game is just a racist double-action boogaloo?
[247:34.47]I mean... Oh, whoa.
[247:43.76]Where's the JoJo stream?
[247:44.92]They're not streaming JoJo on Twitch.
[247:53.92]Distraction.
[247:59.43]I mean, the game was just a little over the top, I think.
[248:06.07]But also, it was made a long time ago.
[248:08.17]When did this game come out?
[248:19.97]You're still gifting subs?
[248:22.67]2005.
[248:22.69]Wait, there's a JoJo marathon on Twitch right now.
[248:29.27]I actually can watch it.
[248:30.32]I can?
[248:44.27]So I can watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in the chat with you guys.
[248:56.69]It's not public domain.
[248:59.12]No, I gotta be, I don't think I can do that.
[249:05.32]Yeah, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is public domain.
[249:08.14]Guys, it's not Frankenstein.
[249:15.68]But anyways, thank you, Rathmouse.
[249:16.94]Thank you, Atrolux Atrux, for the $1.
[249:20.43]I had to.
[249:22.41]One of the sub-gifters tonight.
[249:25.03]Thank you.
[249:26.79]Thank you, Snooze and Copter for the $1.
[249:28.47]Can someone gift me a sub?
[249:32.69]Can somebody?
[249:34.45]Aren't you already a sub?
[249:35.35]You were giving subs out.
[249:38.51]You were already doing it.
[249:40.12]It's public domain?
[249:43.74]I gotta look that up.
[249:44.90]Thank you, Sergy.
[249:47.54]Sergy Fendor for the $1.
[249:49.86]With all these subs, can you open a sandwich shop?
[249:53.62]I thought about it before.
[249:56.96]Thank you, Rune, or Rune, for the $1.
[249:59.96]This chat is great.
[250:02.06]I'm glad you like the chat.
[250:03.78]Glad you like this little community.
[250:05.04]Thank you.
[250:07.04]DingusMcGooberPants, thanks for the $1.
[250:11.33]Divusp, thanks for the $1.
[250:13.23]YoJermBoy, if you can, please do the FL Studio stream.
[250:18.58]That would be absolutely crazy.
[250:19.88]Just the thought of it already got me hyped as fuck.
[250:23.00]And speaking of music, have you ever played a musical instrument?
[250:26.06]Hope you're doing good, big boy.
[250:28.28]Yep, I play the drums.
[250:30.30]If you gave me a drum set right now in front of me, I would be able to reasonably play it fairly well.
[250:37.91]You guys, if you want to call me out on that, get me... If I'm ever in a room with a drum set and I'm on camera, say, prove it, liar.
[250:44.63]And I'll get on the drum set and I'll actually play it pretty well.
[250:47.10]So...
[250:50.02]Just make sure you let me know.
[250:56.42]Please send him drums.
[251:00.32]Oh, that will help with the music.
[251:01.78]I will help with the music stream.
[251:05.10]Make a Lavo drum kit.
[251:08.13]Drums aren't real instruments.
[251:09.69]What?
[251:11.73]How could you?
[251:12.15]How dare you?
[251:13.91]Talk so boldly about the percussions.
[251:16.79]The percussions section.
[251:17.79]Come on.
[251:18.77]It's percussion.
[251:22.79]You know, the drummer actually is the guy that carries the whole band.
[251:27.03]Without the drummer, what the hell would the guy with the guitar do?
[251:30.10]He'd have his finger up his nose.
[251:34.18]The percussion section makes sure everything goes according to plan.
[251:37.90]Keeps everybody in line.
[251:40.35]And is the... It's the quarterback.
[251:43.61]It's not the lead singer.
[251:44.73]It's not the lead guitarist.
[251:45.85]The quarterback of the band is the drummer.
[251:50.65]He decides where it goes.
[251:52.09]He decides how the song's gonna go.
[251:53.47]And if he's gonna change something, they ought to change with him.
[251:56.86]Drummers throw audibles all the time that the band has to keep up with.
[252:00.58]It's the quarterback.
[252:11.11]That's what they tell the drummer so they don't feel bad.
[252:15.25]What do they tell the bassist in that scenario?
[252:23.15]Hey guys some some bassists in songs play like four notes Sometimes you can talk about shit about drums Some bass tracks are like dude Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan
[252:50.39]The guy could drink coffee and eat a sandwich while he was playing it.
[252:57.21]Drummers just hit the same four cans.
[252:59.09]Yeah, but it's at different tempos.
[253:17.56]You wanna play this game?
[253:18.44]Alright, I'll play this game.
[253:23.52]Just give me one second.
[253:56.99]Nice, okay.
[253:59.59]Alright, what else do we have here?
[254:00.87]How would you like an edge that helps you pick winning stocks faster?
[254:04.01]An edge that is proven to outperform the S&P 500 by... Okay.
[254:11.08]Is that a curiosity?
[254:14.56]This guy's doing a handstand.
[254:16.54]Like, are you fucking kidding me?
[254:33.15]Yeah, he's doing that with his feet by the way.
[255:03.34]I'm playing two different videos at the same time.
[255:08.12]These are not related, but they're going together very well.
[255:38.96]I mean, that's kind of cool.
[255:40.94]I mean, that's pretty cool.
[255:42.48]Hold on, hold on.
[255:44.39]Okay, let's... Sounds like shit.
[255:51.27]Get out of here.
[256:09.30]Drummer's the backbone.
[256:14.06]The bassist is the fucking intern of the band.
[256:18.20]I'm kidding.
[256:19.04]I'm fucking kidding.
[256:22.54]Drummer Cope.
[256:24.99]Look, I was attacked by a bunch of bassists in this chat.
[256:32.21]You can't stand on top of the bass pedestal and talk shit about the drums.
[256:43.60]You're a bassist.
[256:50.86]God.
[257:00.89]I thought he was a drummer.
[257:07.61]Look, can we all agree that the manager doesn't need to exist?
[257:12.47]Guys, Bobby the Brain Heenan did more managing in the WWF than the manager does for a band.
[257:34.07]Did you have to throw up?
[257:36.97]Yeah, but you got me talking.
[257:41.47]You just offended all the managers in this chat.
[257:44.59]Who do you think... Don't you guys like it at the end of the streams?
[257:54.11]Don't you like how we can just talk shit about nothing?
[257:59.10]And, like, none of this matters.
[258:00.32]None of it's real.
[258:01.38]This is just, like, an open forum of nonsense.
[258:03.76]I love it.
[258:12.08]I prefer the game.
[258:16.19]But anyways, alright, let's get through these.
[258:18.53]We've been talking enough shit.
[258:26.91]But thank you to... Topek for the $1.
[258:31.46]Thank you, Topek.
[258:33.02]Holy shit, so many subs.
[258:34.06]You should give us some of your bits now.
[258:38.20]A bit trade-in program for subs.
[258:42.57]Thank you, Son of Jenova, for the $1 hello, Jerma.
[258:45.04]While watching you stream, I made this.
[258:57.86]You made that.
[259:01.04]It's Jax.
[259:04.72]No, I did.
[259:10.37]Rip the shirt.
[259:11.11]No, no.
[259:11.91]What do you mean rip the shirt?
[259:13.29]Oh, because I have the Mexico shirt.
[259:16.53]I love that shirt.
[259:20.59]That's my favorite shirt.
[259:21.41]Why would I rip that shirt?
[259:24.60]But thank you so much, Son of Jenova.
[259:31.16]I should have worn the Mexico shirt.
[259:40.45]I was blessed by a priest.
[259:43.25]No, that was good.
[259:43.97]Thanks a lot, man.
[259:46.02]Thank you to the many talented artists and musicians that send stuff to us every stream.
[259:53.80]Thank you.
[259:56.08]All the talented bassists, drummers, guitarists, tambourine players,
[260:09.20]Everybody in the marching band, all the people in the color guard.
[260:11.31]All the managers.
[260:21.55]All the triangle players.
[260:24.25]All the banjoists.
[260:27.25]Would you rather have your arms twice as long or your legs twice as long?
[260:30.07]My leg's twice as long.
[260:35.28]The curtain pullers.
[260:37.44]The backstage guy that pulls the curtain with the pulley.
[260:43.56]But, hey, Vegas, thank you, Vagus, for the $10 here.
[260:46.64]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching your content for almost five years at this point.
[260:51.77]Just want to say thank you for all the laughs you've given me.
[260:54.23]And also, thanks for being such a great role model and inspiration for me.
[260:57.67]Hope your move to Vegas is a smooth one.
[261:00.33]Also, quick question.
[261:01.59]After you move to Vegas, will you be changing your stream schedule as well?
[261:04.39]Yes.
[261:05.95]I'll be starting about an hour earlier than I do right now.
[261:11.11]Going to Pacific Time, starting a stream at 7pm PST would be a terrible idea.
[261:17.21]That means that Eastern Time, that's like 10 o'clock at night.
[261:21.67]If I were to keep my same 7pm schedule, the stream would start every time right now.
[261:28.02]That's not going to happen.
[261:31.54]So I will be going to a 3 or 4 p.m.
[261:34.40]Pacific schedule, which is like a 6 p.m.
[261:39.12]I'm shooting for like a 6 p.m.
[261:40.60]Eastern, 5 to 6 p.m.
[261:41.96]Eastern time, which will end up being about 3 p.m.
[261:44.88]Pacific.
[261:47.22]So the only difference is that the stream is going to pull back an hour.
[261:49.82]That's it.
[261:56.47]Central, boys.
[261:59.87]EST people?
[262:01.53]No, it's starting at 6, not 7.
[262:03.58]That's it.
[262:06.04]But thank you, Fagus.
[262:07.76]I really appreciate it.
[262:10.12]Thank you so much for the kind words as well.
[262:12.82]Quarter dime.
[262:13.36]Thank you for the $4.
[262:14.22]I love the fact that none of this is based on what you're doing in the game right now.
[262:17.19]We just love you for who you are.
[262:23.69]Thank you.
[262:27.61]Thank you for...
[262:29.88]Everything.
[262:34.56]Shocks me on a daily basis.
[262:36.81]It does.
[262:37.19]Thank you.
[262:40.87]I just hope I can keep you guys entertained.
[262:49.40]I hope you still enjoy it as we move forward.
[262:54.08]Thank you so much.
[262:57.31]Uh, SheeXOXO, thanks for the $1.13, good luck with the credits.
[263:02.65]As you saw, that was not even, there was a non-attempt there.
[263:08.21]Hey, Leather Jacket, resident mod Leather Jacket, thanks for the $2.
[263:12.95]After an eventful day of my exhaust falling off in the way to work, and waiting two or more hours on the side of the road in the sun, spending $80 on a tow truck, and missing a day of work, finally getting home to see all this generosity in the chat made it all better.
[263:27.23]You saved my day, chat.
[263:31.57]Well, that doesn't sound like a fun day.
[263:35.43]Holy shit, man.
[263:40.82]80 bucks on a tow truck.
[263:44.24]Was it like AAA?
[263:47.02]AAA really is... It's very inexpensive, and it's the weirdest service ever.
[263:57.50]AAA is a lot of... That's not bad.
[264:05.58]If you don't have AAA, I highly recommend you get it.
[264:08.27]It's so cheap to be a member in AAA.
[264:10.75]And no matter what happens to you, your car could break down, you could get gas, something could happen to the car.
[264:17.09]It doesn't matter what it is.
[264:18.55]You call the number from AAA and they will come do everything for you and then leave.
[264:24.92]And that's it.
[264:29.31]I've used AAA three or four times over the last five years.
[264:33.91]It's already paid for itself.
[264:38.95]If you need to be towed, they don't charge you any money.
[264:44.04]It can also depend on what insurance you got.
[264:46.44]For the most part, AAA is very, very... It's part of most plans.
[264:51.96]It is the number one membership service in the country, I think, in America.
[264:58.15]The AARP and AAA are number one and number two for customers in the US.
[265:05.04]But I, like somebody saying I can vouch for it, I can vouch for AAA a thousand times.
[265:09.74]They have bailed me out of so many different problems.
[265:16.06]You didn't get enough money from the subs.
[265:17.66]Guys, AAA doesn't need any more money.
[265:20.72]They have like 300 million subscribers.
[265:25.74]They're not looking, they're not sponsoring anybody.
[265:29.50]They have fucking... They're like a trillion dollar company.
[265:35.70]I thought I was covered for roadside, but I wasn't, so I had to pay out of pocket.
[265:38.58]That sucks, dude.
[265:39.24]I'm sorry to hear that happened.
[265:45.20]I can't wait to see their next stream.
[265:51.71]Number one.
[265:53.47]But thank you, Jacket.
[265:55.47]Hope you have a better day tomorrow.
[265:58.85]Pickle Fizz, thanks for the $1 laugh stream.
[266:01.10]All the links I gave for my V-Video didn't work, so here's some new ones.
[266:05.10]Please, God, let one work.
[266:07.06]This joke is a fucking life support.
[266:09.04]Hold on, am I about to download this MP4?
[266:20.90]Uh, I...
[266:32.30]You missed that video.
[266:33.57]Fires.
[266:34.15]Fires.
[266:36.29]What is a D-A-I dot L-Y link?
[266:42.03]A daily link?
[266:46.03]What is that?
[266:46.47]Holy shit.
[266:51.02]A hundred bucks.
[266:56.50]A hundred dollars from Dengistown right now.
[267:01.65]Thank you so much, Dingus Town, for the 100 bucks.
[267:08.27]Just says... Uh... I just want to say I appreciate you.
[267:18.44]I appreciate you too, Doodman.
[267:20.26]I said Doodman.
[267:21.18]I appreciate you too.
[267:22.86]I tried to say that slower than my brain was trying to say it.
[267:26.80]And I said Doodman.
[267:29.68]But really, thank you so much, Dingus Town.
[267:33.84]You guys have been insane tonight with the monetary realm.
[267:40.66]Thank you.
[267:45.34]100 fucking dollars.
[267:49.82]But anyways, is that a... Is that like daily motion?
[267:55.73]Is that what it is?
[268:15.22]Um, what the hell is this?
[268:23.95]Why can I not click this?
[268:29.15]Alright, let's do it.
[268:31.09]I'm clicking it.
[268:33.49]Prepare to be clicked.
[268:42.64]Uh, why?
[268:43.74]Hold on.
[269:11.29]No, I was gonna do something stupid.
[269:18.61]My credit card's stolen.
[269:37.20]Why can I not do this?
[269:40.02]Okay.
[269:40.50]Alright.
[269:40.86]I got it.
[269:41.20]I got it.
[269:41.44]I figured it out.
[269:41.94]I figured it out.
[269:43.62]Got it.
[269:47.29]Here we go.
[269:47.65]Here comes a B video.
[269:56.47]It's not available.
[270:01.13]The video is not available.
[270:14.22]is it not this one works alright hold on hold on hold on I got it I think this is gonna work we'll try this one more time
[270:50.91]Okay.
[270:52.25]Did it work?
[270:57.54]Well, ladies and gentlemen, it worked.
[271:00.88]We got it.
[271:03.80]In three, two, one.
[271:05.90]When the Hornet saw that it was Jerma who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.
[271:14.56]Please, Jerma, I only had the streams best interest at heart.
[271:18.06]I'm sorry I came into your room.
[271:20.14]Holy shit, there's a button, there's a bee in here.
[271:22.22]Oh, fuck me.
[271:23.31]I meant you no disrespect.
[271:24.79]Wait, oh, spoilers.
[271:25.75]Is this spoilers for the last, uh, airbender?
[271:31.29]Spoilers for the last airbender.
[271:33.45]If you have never seen the last airbender, get out of here.
[271:36.97]Spoilers for that Nickelodeon cartoon.
[271:40.74]Here it comes.
[271:41.96]Three, two, one, here we go.
[271:44.76]I'm a peaceful hornet.
[271:46.76]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[271:49.55]I won't fight you.
[271:50.65]Okay, he landed.
[271:51.35]Oh shit.
[271:53.09]Hold on.
[271:53.37]Wait, wait, wait.
[271:53.67]Hold on.
[271:55.11]He's gone.
[271:55.45]He's dead.
[271:56.93]It's over.
[271:57.43]He's dead.
[271:59.57]I looked away.
[272:00.49]Look at the smoke.
[272:04.83]You see that?
[272:08.55]No disrespect.
[272:10.05]I'm a peaceful hornet.
[272:12.99]This is like the meme voice.
[272:15.20]Go.
[272:15.46]I'm a peaceful hornet.
[272:20.19]Well, we finally got to see it.
[272:29.67]Why did I keep pausing it?
[272:30.71]Because those are spoilers!
[272:32.61]And somebody may not have seen that movie yet.
[272:37.55]Think of the people that get one anime a year like me.
[272:39.85]You wouldn't be ready for that.
[272:45.45]Thank you Pickle Fizz.
[272:46.29]I'm glad we got to see it on stream.
[272:47.67]Thank you Captain Worgen for the $1.
[272:49.15]Everybody's on about Fireman, but I'm still wondering where Waterman is.
[272:55.95]What is this?
[272:59.03]This is an Eric Andre clip.
[273:03.86]Bird up.
[273:04.26]Hello?
[273:05.48]Has anyone seen Waterman?
[273:17.64]The worst show on TV?
[273:23.66]Why do you think this is the worst show on TV?
[273:27.81]I disagree.
[273:28.29]I think Eric Andre is very funny.
[273:38.31]I think that Eric Andre is one of the most absolutely fucking hysterical people
[273:45.37]But I think you need to consume the shit that he does in small doses.
[273:54.49]Like, if you watch, like, three Eric, four Eric Andre episodes in a row, you're gonna have to close your eyes and, like, squint and, like, rub your eyes and be like, Jesus Christ, and you're gonna take, like, a shower.
[274:11.19]It's just, it's way too much overstimulation in one, like, 11 minute episode.
[274:26.06]But, I do think he's funny.
[274:33.27]But anyways.
[274:38.23]Yeah, it's like a YouTube poop.
[274:39.87]No, it really is.
[274:42.35]His whole show is a 11 minute long YouTube poop.
[274:49.69]And guess what?
[274:50.23]Sometimes those are real fucking funny.
[274:52.01]Really funny.
[274:59.13]But I guess to a point where sometimes you see like The Legend of Zelda CDI poop 50 different ways and you gotta take a break.
[275:06.89]And then you'll come back a week later and think it's the funniest damn thing you've ever seen.
[275:20.03]My trending clips are back to normal.
[275:23.70]That's good.
[275:31.76]Maybe, maybe I woke up Twitch.
[275:37.70]But that's, I mean, like... Not to go off on a tangent, but we won't.
[275:42.61]I'm just going to say a few sentences.
[275:46.67]More than anything...
[275:49.52]comedy is so so personal to people it's so just it's incredibly subjective you can't two people will never find the same thing funny they could be arguably two great comedians that have great material and they'll polarize so many people
[276:22.09]Comedy is objective.
[276:23.45]No, it's not.
[276:28.36]Because to think something is funny, you have to pull from your own life, your own beliefs, your own... You have to think it's funny for some reason.
[276:38.74]the only objectively funny comedy routines are like the old charlie chaplin when he would like get hit in the face with a cane and like fall down like that you don't need to have that's fine that's always funny right guy flipping on a banana peel hitting his head on like a bell is like that's hysterical for instance I don't think you're funny
[277:09.83]See?
[277:11.27]That's what I'm saying.
[277:18.46]We're talking comedy here.
[277:23.52]But yeah, it's hard to... But when you do think something's funny, and you also have a friend or person that thinks something is funny as well, you have a lot to communicate about.
[277:33.13]Some of your best friends will be people that think the same thing is funny.
[277:38.24]That means that you two are going to get along real well.
[277:48.85]Forget about how compatible you are.
[277:52.44]What are your political beliefs?
[277:54.24]How do you feel about this?
[277:55.38]No, no.
[277:55.68]Do you both think the same thing is funny?
[277:58.74]You are guaranteed to like each other.
[278:06.13]I probably shouldn't say guarantee, but you know, it's close enough.
[278:12.77]It's the same thing.
[278:14.49]It could be.
[278:17.59]Alright, let's blow through the last few bits.
[278:19.45]Let's get out of here before it gets too late.
[278:24.06]What if they're the Fred movies?
[278:24.96]If you think the Fred movies are funny and you have another guy that you know or a girl that you know and they think the Fred movies are funny, good.
[278:30.18]Enjoy them together.
[278:33.14]Watch them ten times in a row.
[278:39.30]But hey, thank you Upward Fern for the dollar.
[278:41.06]You deserve every sub, and hey, is Kim coming with you to Vegas?
[278:44.06]Yes.
[278:47.80]So is Otto.
[278:49.80]So is Midas.
[278:54.62]It's gonna be a house full of pets and friends.
[279:01.08]Yes, Etalyx as well.
[279:02.64]You know, Midas is coming.
[279:03.84]You know, not that guy.
[279:09.65]thank you thank you uh smelly boy for the one dollar a ton of people gift you subs and you don't even give one dab and thanks come on Jeremy do it for the don't nobody gets a dab I'm sorry that's a line I can't cross
[279:29.25]Hey, Darkstar, thanks for the one dollar.
[279:30.59]One of your favorite games of 2015 is coming to the Switch.
[279:34.05]Victor Vran.
[279:35.57]Just imagine playing that wonderful game while in the waiting room to get the hell pizza pumped from your stomach.
[279:42.73]Yeah, it's moved.
[279:43.51]That pizza has moved from me wanting to throw up down to a different problem.
[279:52.21]That will go, continue to be unnamed.
[279:58.89]But yes, thank you.
[279:59.93]Yes, Victor Brand is a great game.

[280:22.01]You guys are too kind to me.
[280:23.19]Thank you.

[280:52.56]I'm equal parts nervous and excited and all I can say is thank you for helping me get through the shitty days so I can have happy days like today.
[281:00.87]Good luck to you, Dark Star.
[281:05.37]That's only in a couple days.
[281:09.15]You'll... One thing about college that you'll know that's a very, very interesting thing to realize is you'll find plenty of friends.
[281:17.54]I was terrified when I moved to college because I didn't think I was going to be able to talk to anybody.
[281:22.57]You get so removed from your comfort zone, you know the only people you've ever known.
[281:28.22]And then you meet a bunch of random people and you just... Everyone's in the same boat, remember.
[281:33.65]You think that way.
[281:35.01]So does everybody else.
[281:37.42]There's no guy that goes to college for the first time and is like, yep, I got it all fucking figured out.
[281:42.64]I am so fucking cool, and I am ready to make every friend.
[281:46.12]No, no, everyone's terrified.
[281:48.00]Everyone's nervous.
[281:48.90]You're all in the same boat.
[281:50.81]And once you realize that, that's when, you know, you start to talk to people.
[281:56.13]And hey, what classes are you taking, dude?
[281:58.03]And then you turn on the TV, and then...
[282:04.35]the Eric Andre show comes on and you hear it and you're not going to say anything about it.
[282:08.47]Cause you know, the show's kind of polarizing, but you notice that your roommate, you hear like, hello.
[282:16.15]And you hear, and you're like, okay, got it.
[282:18.81]I got a friend now.
[282:19.37]I got it.
[282:19.89]And you walk in the room and you like go, Oh, what are you watching dude?
[282:25.60]And then all of a sudden, bingo, you get your best friend.
[282:40.04]What if they laugh at something else?
[282:41.24]Yeah, what if you go in there?
[282:42.46]What if you don't?
[282:43.22]You don't like Eric Andre.
[282:45.38]And you hear that.
[282:46.26]That's how you know, okay, scratch that guy off the friends list.
[282:48.56]I don't need to talk to him.
[282:51.94]Go one door down.
[282:53.60]And what's that I hear?
[282:54.50]Excuse me, what's that?
[282:55.10]Is that JoJo's Bizarre Adventure on the TV that I hear?
[282:58.38]And you hear him chuckle at something that the character Morgan says.
[283:04.48]And you go, fuck, there we go.
[283:05.40]There's my friend.
[283:14.49]Yeah, character Morgan.
[283:16.49]Or Captain Morgan.
[283:17.53]Captain Morgan is the thing that was in my brain.
[283:20.00]I don't know why.
[283:21.26]Probably for tomorrow.
[283:22.00]Should I drink Captain Morgan tomorrow?
[283:23.68]I haven't drank Captain Morgan in like 15 years.
[283:27.32]That shit's gross.
[283:28.42]Should I drink it tomorrow?
[283:36.69]Why would you drink me?
[283:45.75]Do it as a joke and then pull out the good stuff.
[283:51.65]We'll see.

[284:13.63]Hey Jerma, tonight's sub train inspired me to make this silly little thing.
[284:16.77]Hope your stomach feels better.
[284:20.99]What is this?
[284:27.94]Why am I in a... Wait, is this a reference?
[284:32.20]Are you making a Beatles reference?
[284:33.54]Am I the bassist?
[284:35.42]Is that a yellow submarine?
[284:50.10]But yeah, sure, I guess that too.
[284:53.59]That's awesome, dude.
[284:54.33]Thank you.
[284:57.69]Oh man, I'm a bassist.
[284:59.65]I can't get that out of my head.
[285:02.73]Job well done again, Slime.

[285:16.85]You guys are awesome.
[285:21.46]Thank you.
[285:23.86]Alright, wrapping it up here.
[285:24.83]We've got not very much left to do.
[285:28.37]Did I do it?
[285:28.85]Did I find a new Jerma shitpost?
[285:34.85]Almost.
[285:37.28]You almost had it.
[285:42.10]You almost had it.
[285:52.94]You almost got the a-hole.
[285:58.34]But thank you, Darkstar.
[286:00.11]There's way too many shitposts of me.
[286:03.93]You want me to be president?
[286:06.87]Are you kidding me?
[286:10.71]How am I gonna be president?
[286:13.52]When you got shitposts like this?
[286:24.62]Thank you, though.
[286:25.08]Thank you, Razzle, for the $1.
[286:26.42]Hey, Jerm, have you ever received a... I was asking you if I... The answer is no.
[286:38.63]No, I actually... No.
[286:41.37]I've never received any, like, any... Somebody mad and... They got a very specific word here.
[286:52.71]But I don't really want to... I don't know.
[286:53.63]It's, like, weird to even say it out loud.
[286:56.33]But they're asking about if I've ever received any truly bad social media, like, attacks from somebody.
[287:04.88]Serious ones.
[287:07.00]No.
[287:07.22]I don't know.
[287:10.16]For the most part, I hope you guys realize this.
[287:12.40]Like, I'm just fucking around.
[287:16.16]And I just want to have fun.
[287:17.88]I don't really... I don't want to step on anybody's, like, toes.
[287:19.74]I don't want to, like...
[287:22.46]cause anybody like actual anguish or cause drama with anybody or make anybody feel bad I really don't but uh I mean yeah sometimes there could be people that might go a little overboard maybe but not anything serious and I I just don't um that's like that's kind of like weird and scary right I just I just let me put it this way I really really truly hope that I don't
[287:51.89]make somebody so upset or so actually angry that they would really want me to have something bad happen to me because like that that concerns me not the fact that somebody like why would somebody want to say that about me I think about that shit you know I would never want somebody to really truly feel like that
[288:21.20]Now, hopefully none of you do.
[288:24.64]But yeah, that's... You know, obviously stuff that I don't really talk about that much.
[288:38.61]Sadly, some people just hate others without a reason.
[288:41.83]Yeah, but there always is... There always ends up being a reason for them.
[288:47.17]Somebody just doesn't go around and hate somebody.
[288:49.90]There has to be some reason why they feel that way.
[288:52.34]Why do they feel like that?
[288:56.68]And whether the reason is valid or not, or actually rational or not, it's still there.
[289:02.26]You know?
[289:07.05]But no, I try to stay away from that kind of shit.
[289:10.27]So, the answer is no.
[289:17.45]But anyways.
[289:20.35]Thank you, Razzle.
[289:21.25]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the $1.
[289:22.44]You could legitimately win public office locally.
[289:26.06]You're underestimating how much people love cartoon characters.
[289:31.14]There was a Black Mirror episode about that.
[289:37.00]We saw how that went out.
[289:40.01]But thank you.
[289:40.49]Thank you, Deron J. Deronj, for the $10 here.
[289:45.15]From YouTube to Twitch, you've never failed to make me laugh.
[289:47.01]Thanks for the years of entertainment.
[289:50.39]Thank you for the years of being here.
[289:52.27]And the years of supporting me.
[289:54.69]Couldn't do it without all you guys.
[289:56.27]For real.
[289:58.75]Dinosaurus Rex, thanks for the $1.
[290:00.25]I've been working on a project recently on a clone hero.
[290:03.99]A Guitar Hero fan game.
[290:06.33]Chart of a Jerry's and Sterry's remix.
[290:10.35]by Pipsteer.
[290:11.39]I am new to charting, but I thought you might enjoy it.
[290:13.74]To give some detail, this is a bit of what the community calls an overchart, in which there are way too many notes.
[290:21.76]Hope you in the stream enjoy.
[290:22.98]P.S.
[290:23.26]I'm not actually playing the song.
[290:24.87]It is a bot.
[290:28.11]Let's see.
[290:31.19]Let's hear it.
[290:31.73]It says hi Twitch chat as well.
[290:38.00]My God, look at this.
[290:38.92]This is a bunch of berries, berries, berries, berries, berries.
[290:41.80]It's actually a guitar hero mod.
[290:42.94]Let me get those berries, berries, berries, berries, berries.
[290:46.95]This is a bunch of berries, berries, berries, berries, berries.
[290:50.65]Wow.
[290:50.85]Let me get those berries, berries, berries, berries, berries.
[290:52.91]How long does it take to make?
[290:54.97]Let me take a look.
[290:55.95]Berries, berries, berries, berries.
[290:57.80]Show me berries.
[290:58.44]Give us the berries.
[290:59.30]Show the notes?
[291:00.00]Hold on.
[291:00.38]Here, here, here, here, here, here.
[291:05.90]Here, here.
[291:21.77]Quick play.
[291:25.03]Here he goes.
[291:25.59]This is where we were, right here.
[291:27.31]Let me get those bellies, bellies, bellies, bellies, bellies.
[291:30.45]Look at that, 2,000 FPS.
[291:31.49]Bellies, bellies, bellies, bellies.
[291:33.51]That's a fast computer.
[291:35.57]Bellies, bellies, bellies, bellies.
[291:37.65]I'd like some bellies, bellies, bellies, bellies.
[291:46.37]my stomach I love this
[292:23.87]Stop!
[292:24.67]What do you mean, stop skipping?
[292:26.31]I wanted to see what... That's one of my favorite videos, by the way.
[292:55.23]That's up there with some of my favorite videos.
[293:00.62]But thank you, Dinosaurus Rex.
[293:03.48]Link, link, link, link, link, link, link, link.
[293:05.32]Here's a link.
[293:05.80]Link, link, link, link, link, link, link, link, link, link, link, link, link.
[293:10.54]Jeremiah, give us a link.
[293:11.58]Jeremiah, give us a link.
[293:12.56]Where's the fucking link?
[293:13.58]Where's the fucking link?
[293:17.80]Okay.
[293:19.92]There you go.
[293:24.17]And let's keep going.
[293:26.89]Thank you to Asian Turtle for the $1.
[293:28.27]Hey, just thought I'd give you a dollar, my favorite Twitcher.
[293:30.87]And tell you about one of my favorite comedians.
[293:32.29]He's fairly under-watched.
[293:34.62]He's got a great special called Do She?
[293:38.94]With Vin Edgar.
[293:41.56]He uses words to tell jokes.
[293:43.28]Thanks, by the way.
[293:44.78]That was a lie.
[293:46.05]Wait, what?
[293:58.06]I can't fucking believe you got me like that.
[294:02.04]That took you probably like 40 minutes to figure out the exact way to write that.
[294:12.05]Good work, you got me.
[294:13.79]Thank you Broluck for the $1.
[294:15.03]Yes, Steam had to change their policy here in Australia because they tried to get around some of the laws.
[294:20.47]There's now a warning on their page apologizing and admitting they're wrong.
[294:24.69]Consumer rights notice.
[294:27.79]Weren't they selling games for, like, 40% more than they should be or something?
[294:34.04]That's kind of insane.
[294:35.24]Something like that.
[294:37.02]Hey, Skib!
[294:38.12]Skiblet, thanks for the three dollars.
[294:39.82]I remember watching every single one of your Jerma Rumba videos with a friend and laughing so hard that water came out of our noses.
[294:47.71]Keep up the good work.
[294:50.63]I will try.
[294:51.05]Thank you, Brawluck.
[294:54.31]He says, mate, buy a cat.
[294:56.21]I have a cat.
[294:58.51]There currently is a cat in my life.
[295:06.33]What do you mean, buy a cat?
[295:08.42]I'm not buying another cat.
[295:13.66]More cats.
[295:21.48]Need a friend.
[295:22.90]Otto is this cat's friend, okay?
[295:28.16]Prove it.
[295:28.78]It's Kim's cat.
[295:29.82]You guys know Kim's cat.
[295:30.94]Young Soi.
[295:31.70]What are you talking about?
[295:35.50]Yes.
[295:45.30]Never heard of it.
[295:47.70]I don't... Not my cat.
[295:56.41]It's her cat.
[295:58.97]But it's still, nonetheless, a cat still in my life and in my space, right?
[296:06.34]It's a very sweet cat.
[296:12.12]Get a cat of your own, then.
[296:13.22]No, alright, alright.
[296:14.72]It's time to go.
[296:16.14]Thank you, Spuds, for the dollar.
[296:18.85]Make sure when you do the music stream that you can use the tracks in Rat Movie 3.
[296:23.20]Maybe I'll just make the Rat Movie 3 song on stream.
[296:26.26]That would be fun, wouldn't it?
[296:27.20]Rattuna, thanks for the $1.
[296:28.32]Same, Jerma.
[296:28.74]I'm actually having this problem at the moment.
[296:30.92]One of my pet rats, Oscar, is two years old.
[296:33.83]He doesn't have much longer.
[296:35.67]jermaPluto, but they're still really amazing pets and are a great experience.
[296:39.99]Thank you, Rattuna.
[296:45.11]Sorry to hear about that, but yes, that is one of the issues with owning any of the small animals.
[296:51.23]Mice, gerbils, hamsters, rats...
[296:54.79]Although, like, I was gonna say chinchilla, but don't chinchillas live 15 years or something?
[297:01.46]Birds are like that too?
[297:02.32]Yeah, they are.
[297:02.86]Unless you have a parrot, one of the huge birds that live like 40 years.
[297:10.20]Uh, Chubby Kitten, thanks for the $1.
[297:11.66]Rate my kitty.
[297:14.14]That is a solid 9 out of 10 kitty.
[297:19.34]I would say.
[297:20.70]I would say that's definitely like a 9.4 out of 10.
[297:24.65]For sure.
[297:27.11]Thank you, Son of Genova, for the $1.
[297:28.57]Sure, bass is always four notes.
[298:00.67]That's doctored.
[298:01.17]That's a doctored video.
[298:02.29]They added in a bunch of extra beats and stuff.
[298:04.27]It's a fake video.
[298:09.96]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[298:15.50]You can't disbasis when Victor Wooten exists.
[298:18.45]Let's see.
[298:49.55]It's, like, sad that on Reddit it came out that he was, like, a faker and a liar and his videos were, like, all pumped in audio.
[298:54.27]It's, like, too bad.
[299:12.00]Oh, yeah.
[299:12.84]It came out that he, like, stole from local drummers.
[299:14.96]I mean, come on, man.
[299:22.10]No, that was fucking insane.
[299:24.55]That was absolutely fucking ridiculous.
[299:29.27]I pray to be that talented.
[299:33.68]Play it on two times speed, okay.
[300:06.10]That reminds me of the Tim and Eric, uh, Totino's Pizza Rolls commercial.
[300:13.27]With this thing.
[300:17.49]Remember Totino's Pizza Boy?
[300:21.68]Hey, my name's Hard Rock Joe, and I hope you like punk music, because there's a punk song that I wrote for Totino's Pizza Rolls.
[300:31.44]Hey.
[300:37.50]Like back here, ready?
[300:40.58]That's what I'm all about.
[300:42.40]Hardcore punk scene.
[300:43.91]That's what I'm all about.
[300:44.85]Like punk bass.
[300:46.09]And pizza rolls.
[300:46.77]That one's really about the hardcore punk scene.
[301:04.28]Too bad it came out that Tim and Eric faked that baseline.
[301:06.70]Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[301:07.82]But anyways.
[301:18.39]Thank you to Free iPod for the $1.
[301:20.29]I have to clean the house and I'm not feeling it.
[301:22.57]How do I get motivated?
[301:23.51]I've been putting it off for two weeks.
[301:25.69]Clean your house.
[301:28.05]Clean your house now.
[301:28.87]Do you understand?
[301:33.00]Get up right now.
[301:34.82]And clean your house.
[301:37.28]Do it.
[301:38.77]Now.
[301:40.27]Turn off the stream.
[301:41.01]I don't want to see you here.
[301:42.89]You're going to be in big trouble if you don't do it.
[301:48.45]No, I'm in bed.
[301:51.43]Set an alarm.
[301:53.36]For 6 a.m.
[301:54.26]And you get... When that... You know snooze button for you.
[301:58.04]Don't hit the snooze button six times.
[302:00.46]6 a.m.
[302:01.14]I want you up out of your bed.
[302:04.21]Go get a coffee.
[302:07.11]Come back.
[302:08.46]Start sweeping.
[302:09.08]It's easy.
[302:09.66]It's just sweep first.
[302:11.30]Don't you know the first thing about cleaning a house?
[302:13.12]You can pretend you cleaned a house if you just sweep a little bit and pick up the laundry.
[302:18.95]Your house is going to look like somebody cleaned it professionally.
[302:30.73]Are you gonna personally come kick my ass with a shoe?
[302:33.31]No, no, no, I'm not gonna, no, I said that wrong.
[302:40.27]Don't you know all you gotta do is just stand in the, okay, if you have like a 15 foot by 15 foot room, like a living room, just stand in the corner, and all you gotta do is just breathe in a huge amount of air.
[302:53.98]Fill up your lungs and just do a huge gust out.
[303:00.03]All the dust.
[303:00.61]You dust the room.
[303:01.45]The laundry will move out of the way.
[303:02.55]And then just take out the trash and you'll be fine.
[303:14.02]Genghis Town, thanks for the hundred bucks a little bit earlier ago.
[303:16.34]Thank you so much, dude.
[303:18.40]Upward Fern, thank you for the $2.45.
[303:20.72]Also, Jeremy, you keep me company at my new job.
[303:22.74]I don't know if you remember my choice on whether or not to go to welding school.
[303:27.33]I decided to go.
[303:28.85]It's one of the best decisions I've ever made.
[303:31.23]And if I don't talk and chat, doesn't mean I'm not here.
[303:33.69]Thank you.
[303:35.53]There you go.
[303:38.07]Got it.
[303:39.57]You did it.
[303:42.17]You did it.
[303:44.35]Fuck yeah, man.
[303:52.88]We're proud of you.
[303:56.06]Are you welding while watching?
[304:00.06]Thank you so much, Upward Fern.
[304:03.72]I'm glad you did it.
[304:07.53]Hope you enjoy the job.
[304:18.68]Thank you, Stutimus, for the $1.
[304:20.48]Hey, Jerma, thanks for entertaining me all these years.
[304:22.89]You really are a cool guy.
[304:24.35]Sometimes when I feel a bit down, I like to watch some of your old stuff, including those advice videos you made years ago.
[304:29.59]Thanks for the laughs, and have a good night, dude.
[304:31.01]Thank you.
[304:31.31]You too, Stu.
[304:37.20]Thanks for calling me a cool guy, and thank you for watching.
[304:40.00]Appreciate it.
[304:40.48]Thank you.
[304:43.03]Sergi Fendor, thanks for the $1.
[304:44.77]Hello, it's me again.
[304:45.53]You've said my name wrong twice.
[304:47.77]It's pronounced Sergif Fendor.

[304:52.45]Thank you, Sergif.
[304:54.05]Thank you, Sergif, for the correction and the $1.
[304:57.07]Broluck, thanks for the $1.

[305:01.92]No, you're not going to pay me to click on your website.
[305:04.28]That is technically called sponsorship.
[305:07.76]And I have to disclose my sponsorships.
[305:10.55]So, I cannot be paid to check out a website.
[305:14.81]I hope it's a good website.
[305:15.73]Thank you.
[305:18.07]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.

[307:25.17]But thank you, Eve.
[307:25.73]Thank you, Darkstar, again.
[307:28.47]Of course, as soon as I tell chat I'm going to college, the first thing they say is, uh, get paid.
[307:35.97]Get paid.
[307:36.49]Yeah, because you're going to school.
[307:38.60]You're going to school, you're learning, you're getting some education, you're getting a degree, and you're going to make some more money.
[307:45.12]Every degree goes up.
[307:49.52]Thank you, Jake Games, for the $1.
[307:51.00]I have a bottle of Captain Morgan in the freezer.
[307:52.72]I'll force myself to drink it if you do.
[307:56.20]We'll see.
[308:00.68]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer, again, for the $1.
[308:04.55]Garf is back from his island expedition.
[308:06.34]You said it'd take a month, but I cracked down on the case since it sounded urgent.
[308:10.42]I found the island.
[308:11.30]I called it Otto Island.
[308:13.22]There's a tribe of native cats here called the Sabretooth Goof Goofs.
[308:19.10]They could barely understand me, but after showing them a video of you getting scoop slammed into a table, they were hooked.
[308:24.43]I expect to see them in chat.
[308:32.53]This, apparently.
[308:41.22]What is this?
[308:41.58]Wait, what does no cookie mean?
[308:46.89]What is that?
[308:55.77]What is no cookie?
[308:58.27]Nocookie.net?
[309:00.29]What the fuck did I just click?
[309:01.43]It means there's no cookies.
[309:04.25]But I don't know what that is.
[309:05.64]I know what a cookie is.
[309:08.27]I don't want you to run cookies by me.
[309:13.51]But thank you, Garfield.
[309:14.55]Congratulations on your expedition.
[309:16.24]Hey, Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[309:17.48]I've given you $8.
[309:19.00]You have to play this video.
[309:22.44]Well, that would mean it was a sponsorship.
[309:24.86]And you'd be sponsoring me to play something, so I'm not going to.
[309:31.24]I have to disclose those things.
[309:38.08]Two hours to go through bits.
[309:39.83]Well, we've been dicking around a lot, so... How much for Minecraft?
[309:46.95]What did I say?
[309:47.71]A million dollars for Minecraft?
[309:49.11]Right?
[309:58.27]There's a million dollars, right?
[310:02.17]Better start saving.
[310:05.51]Thank you, eefs, for the $1.
[310:06.83]Also, I seriously love this community and I don't think I've seen a more loving and supportive community.
[310:11.81]I've been watching you for the longest time, Jerma.
[310:13.23]I found you from actually one of the TF2 unboxing videos and I was like 12 years old.
[310:17.82]I've been watching you since your GTA... And I have been watching you since your GTA videos when they came out.
[310:24.38]You never made me laugh like that before.
[310:28.38]It was a long time ago.
[310:32.42]I do remember those TF2 unboxing videos.
[310:36.42]And the GTA... The GTA 4 videos are... I'm glad that those are preserved forever.
[310:41.46]Until YouTube turns off.
[310:42.54]But if YouTube... Like I said, if YouTube.com turns off... Oh, sorry.
[310:45.77]YouTube is no longer ever available again.
[310:48.07]Look out your fucking window.
[310:50.57]Right?
[310:53.27]Way more problems to deal with then.
[310:57.83]But thank you.
[310:59.63]Thank you also to... CluelessSniper for the $1.
[311:03.26]Go lie down, Jerma.

[311:04.78]Jerma Hart.
[311:05.36]I will.
[311:06.62]I'm going to do something else first, though.
[311:09.20]Walk my dog and water my plants.
[311:11.34]Solomon the Squid, thanks for the $1.
[311:12.78]I was thinking about Fireman and how he needs a friend, so I made a Waterman character real quick.
[311:16.42]Thanks for the great stream, by the way.
[311:18.88]Well, Waterman already existed.
[311:21.46]Waterman was the second t-shirt.
[311:29.96]But that Waterman looks really cool, though.
[311:35.86]That's pretty sick water, man.
[311:43.41]I like the little... I like the little dimples.
[311:47.99]The little, uh, cheeks.
[311:49.81]It's very cute.
[311:54.36]Yeah, they could be more than one water, but this universe could be full of water and fire based characters, or Earth and platinum and metal and gold.

[313:55.18]Hey Jerma, I finally got my driver's license last week.
[313:58.00]I passed on my first try and it was easier than I thought it would be.
[314:01.19]But for the wrong reason.
[314:02.81]The DMV in my town has really rude people and they don't really seem to care.
[314:07.27]My test felt half-assed and I feel like I might not have passed a more professional setting.
[314:12.27]I'm still happy I got it, but I almost felt like I didn't.
[314:14.63]Thanks for the streams.
[314:17.84]So it's the guy who's just like, yeah, whatever.
[314:19.86]Pull out, please.
[314:22.46]Did you hit that guy?
[314:24.62]Whatever, just keep going.
[314:26.34]I'll give you a minus one point.
[314:29.16]Hey, you got it, right?
[314:30.70]Congratulations on the license.
[314:32.52]Just drive around.
[314:34.70]Get familiar with the car.
[314:35.89]Become one with the car.
[314:37.63]It'll become like riding a bike.
[314:38.79]You won't even know you're doing it.
[314:39.79]You'll just be like, alright, this is easy.
[314:40.91]I'm doing it.
[314:42.81]But thank you, Dragon Breath.
[314:43.71]Thank you, Optimus.
[314:45.17]$27,000 for the $1.
[314:45.55]Hey, Jerma, I saw the end of the Urban Runner's VOD and saw that you watched my Full Metal Jerma video.
[314:52.63]It made my days.
[314:53.27]I've been watching your videos for the longest time.
[314:54.77]And you're one of my favorite content creators.
[314:57.03]And biggest inspirations for YouTube.

[315:49.05]The last one dollar, Brolic.
[315:50.07]Thanks, man.
[315:51.92]But thank you, Draco.
[315:54.18]Um... Don't call me that.
[315:57.62]That's not a nice thing to say to somebody.
[315:59.58]Ban him for life.
[316:03.51]No, no, not for life.
[316:04.29]That's not a life sentence.
[316:05.23]That's more like a...
[316:07.78]That's more like everybody in the chat just say... Just everybody in the chat just go, hey, don't... Stop it, idiot.
[316:14.24]No, don't call him an idiot.
[316:15.02]Say, hey, don't... How dare you, guy.
[316:17.94]And that's it.
[316:18.56]That's the only punishment.
[316:19.26]Stop it, dude.
[316:28.73]I'm tired.
[316:29.35]I had, like, that idiot on there.
[316:31.23]Like, I'm just tired.
[316:32.15]I'm sorry.
[316:32.57]He's not an idiot.
[316:34.25]He's just making a funny... He's just making a joke.
[316:41.76]Alright, so he's been publicly shamed.
[316:44.90]Now let him back in here.
[316:45.82]Alright, come here, you.
[316:46.90]That's what I'm saying.
[316:47.94]Alright.

[317:30.58]Like, I gotta be careful.
[317:32.78]I know it's probably safe.
[317:34.27]I know it is.
[317:34.93]But, like, you know what I mean?
[317:35.83]Like, I kind of... It's a raw file.
[317:38.01]I know, but, like, just think about it from my perspective, right?
[317:43.91]The one time that somebody oversteps those privileges, and, like, I put a link in chat, and they're like, holy shit, he actually did it.

[320:55.15]I apologize profusely, but her boyfriend was incredibly mad.
[320:57.43]But she told me to pay him no mind.
[320:59.16]I simply reply, tell your boyfriend if he says he's got beef that I'm a vegetarian and I'm not fucking scared of him.

[321:31.80]Hey, Jeremy, thanks for your computer security advice.
[321:33.46]When I asked my grandson how to get on the internet, he gave me a link to Google.com.
[321:36.96]It seemed sketchy, so I blocked him and decided to cut all communication with him.

[321:41.14]Hey, Eve, thanks for the $1.
[321:42.34]I need it, Jerma.

[322:04.29]Japanese, okay.
[322:12.18]Okay, in Japanese.
[322:20.06]Does this translate from Italian?
[322:21.56]This is not Italian.
[322:22.14]Why is this not translating?
[322:33.16]Okay, in Italian, this says... Go God From.
[322:37.04]There you go.
