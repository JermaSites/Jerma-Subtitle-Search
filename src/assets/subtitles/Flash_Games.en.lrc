[01:22.31]Why can I not send a tweet right now?
[01:25.69]We're sorry, we cannot send a tweet right now.
[01:27.91]Would you like to retry?
[01:28.75]Yeah, retry it.
[01:31.63]We're sorry, you can't do that right now.
[01:34.17]What happened?
[01:36.01]Why does everybody... I swear to God, I'm made out of static electricity.
[01:41.64]You know how people are like, we're 70% water?
[01:42.70]Uh-uh, not me.
[01:43.06]Nope, I am 70% static electricity.
[01:50.63]8% water.
[01:51.89]2% blood.
[01:53.55]And... 20% piss.
[01:59.62]Give me a second, hold on.
[02:18.09]Somebody said that's not possible.
[02:19.37]Yes, it is.
[02:21.23]You can be 70% electricity.
[02:26.20]Ask that to Electro.
[02:28.50]You know, the Spider-Man villain.
[02:33.10]Does he think he's 70% water?
[02:36.55]What about the human flame?
[02:38.97]Right?
[02:39.11]The human torch?
[02:40.43]Is he 70% water?
[02:40.81]Nope.
[02:46.97]That guy's at 90% fire.
[02:50.46]10% human.
[02:56.88]The human flame.
[02:58.14]The human piss.
[02:59.62]Hi guys, how you doing?
[03:01.86]So... I don't know if you can tell by the tone of my voice.
[03:05.31]A little irritated this afternoon, this evening.
[03:09.61]Uh, I've been having blue screen problems with my computer.
[03:13.77]I've blue screened like, probably 8 or 9 times now.
[03:16.91]Today.
[03:18.81]So this is great.
[03:20.33]I don't know why.
[03:21.37]I burnt that fucking CD man, I swear to god.
[03:23.86]Um, like the computer went to shit.
[03:28.00]I don't know, maybe there was like a loose cord in there when it burnt the CD.
[03:31.06]I'm gonna just say that's what it was, but... Um...
[03:37.25]Here we go.
[03:38.55]We're gonna try.
[03:39.35]So what I decided, because I couldn't really set anything up, what we're gonna do is we're gonna play... We're gonna play a bunch of brain games.
[03:45.46]Gonna play a bunch of flash games.
[03:49.52]I did not locate the dead animal.
[03:51.04]Not yet.
[03:56.12]The screen broke the computer.
[03:57.56]Probably.
[03:58.26]But let me tweet something.
[04:00.09]I'll be right back.
[05:01.66]Dude, why can't I send a tweet?
[05:04.14]It won't let me tweet.
[05:06.50]Why?
[05:06.82]I-I have inner- What does it think is wrong?
[05:10.94]Why won't you let me do anything?
[05:14.55]Are they angry at my Call of Duty tweet last night?
[05:25.34]Blue tweet of death, apparently.
[05:29.16]Did I get banned from Twitter?
[05:34.36]What if I got banned?
[05:35.40]What did I do?
[05:36.10]I didn't do anything.
[05:36.96]Somebody go to my Twitter.
[05:44.29]Did I get banned from Twitter for no reason?
[05:47.41]No, I'm still here.
[05:48.73]I'm going to try this one more time.
[06:02.04]You're gonna play brain games.
[06:03.30]We can't figure out how to send a tweet.
[06:05.24]I'm sending the tweet, it just says, we can't do that.
[06:09.52]It didn't say, we can't do that.
[06:11.26]Also, by the way, you're in trouble.
[06:12.70]It didn't say that either.
[06:13.72]Alright, last attempt, and then I don't even care.
[06:22.53]Can I no longer send a link?
[06:23.65]Is my account, like, flagged for no links?
[06:27.67]No idea.
[06:31.05]It already tweeted.
[06:34.85]No, I don't see it.
[06:37.77]Am I tweeting like five times in a row right now?
[06:43.96]Maybe it's too long.
[06:45.58]No way.
[06:46.00]It's like this.
[06:46.46]Okay, whatever.
[06:47.74]Sorry.
[06:50.20]Anyways, here we go.
[06:50.76]We're going to be playing some brain games.
[06:55.56]I got a ton of these loaded up here.
[07:01.47]No tweets.
[07:04.71]Is it true that I did the voice acting for the rats in Vermintide 2?
[07:07.42]No, I did not.
[07:10.00]But this is THE brain game.
[07:11.60]We're going to start with this one.
[07:14.26]What do I have up here?
[07:15.08]I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... I got like 20 or 30 different brain games to play.
[07:23.52]So, this is going to be... I told you this was going to be a weird stream and I jinxed myself.
[07:32.22]Let's see.
[07:32.94]This is probably going to be loud as fuck.
[07:34.38]I'm sorry.
[07:38.46]No, okay.
[07:39.12]No, that's not bad.
[07:40.74]Guy, hold on a minute.
[07:42.63]We have a game developer that made a game that not only is the music very soothing and very nice, it was not really loud.
[07:51.29]Okay.
[07:52.77]So, recreate pattern.
[07:53.75]Click on the grid to create the same pattern as the example.
[07:58.05]I'm going to test our intelligence here.
[08:01.53]We've got, uh, what did you want?
[08:04.01]That was really easy.
[08:06.87]Alright.
[08:08.93]I may have overestimated some of these brain games.
[08:14.79]No, hold on, it's getting harder.
[08:15.87]That was just a test.
[08:19.19]I just wish it wasn't candy and donuts.
[08:22.56]I do have an IQ test.
[08:23.74]I have one ready to go.
[08:29.23]Not bad.
[08:30.03]I would say that's a 9th grade level right there.
[08:34.99]Okay.
[08:39.25]That was like 11th grade.
[08:46.96]We passed the 12th grade one.
[08:48.76]I fell asleep in class that time.
[08:57.78]Come on, this is like, what?
[09:00.40]Sorry, I can't match the ice cream codes.
[09:08.00]Big brain.
[09:08.82]Also, I'm not... What the hell is that?
[09:13.54]Oh, the timer is counting down.
[09:15.04]Alright, here we go.
[09:20.82]Got it.
[09:21.60]I got a 60.
[09:24.91]Low to high.
[09:25.37]Click on the numbers from low to high in the correct order.
[09:31.35]What?
[09:31.57]Does it want me to do?
[09:34.32]Okay, I guess.
[09:35.20]1, 4, 6, 8.
[09:35.48]We got 0, 3, 6, 7.
[09:38.58]See how fast that was?
[09:48.45]I clicked- I tried to click it!
[09:49.89]Don't get mad this- Don't get- Don't fucking unhinge yourself right now.
[09:53.29]This is made for 8 year olds.
[09:55.00]Don't unhinge.
[09:56.80]You tried to click it and it didn't work.
[10:07.91]It doesn't help that the mouse is just painstakingly disappearing every 10 seconds.
[10:12.63]And look, I can't even see what the fuck I'm doing.
[10:18.63]You wouldn't believe how laggy this is I'm trying to fucking did not public already fucking pissed.
[10:30.02]I got like a broken computer And I'm sitting here clicking on like eighth-grade puzzles Fuck am I doing?
[10:49.93]Running out of time.
[10:50.51]Here we go.
[10:51.05]Alright, same image.
[10:51.85]Is the current image the same as the previous image?
[10:54.17]Okay, let's find out.
[11:04.50]Fucks up child's game computer broke.
[11:06.40]No, Mike.
[11:07.34]You want me to tweet a picture?
[11:09.30]You want me to tweet a picture?
[11:10.22]I took a screenshot of it.
[11:11.86]I'll give you the date and the time.
[11:13.44]And I'll tweet it.
[11:14.82]Like the 12 blue screens I've had today.
[11:19.82]Let's tweet it.
[11:22.71]Fuck, I can't even use Twitter.
[11:28.83]Is the current image the same as the... Alright, that's an octopus.
[11:34.03]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 hands on an octopus.
[11:39.94]That is the same image.
[11:45.30]Not a match.
[11:45.84]What?
[11:49.80]I'm so confused right now.
[11:56.41]I... Hold on, it wants... I get it.
[11:59.45]This is just... This is just so odd.
[12:03.96]Is this the same picture as the last one?
[12:05.84]Like, okay.
[12:08.16]No, it's not.
[12:25.58]I don't understand Does this make me a brain billionaire?
[12:35.09]I don't get it I kind of like don't want to do this anymore Can I be done?
[12:52.54]This is just making me tired.
[12:55.48]Is it loud?
[13:02.45]I'll turn it down.
[13:06.85]Choose the heaviest item.
[13:09.64]It's fucking watermelons.
[13:14.92]What is it?
[13:15.88]Is it cheese?
[13:24.19]What are you even trying to tell me here?
[13:30.28]Uh... It's the... It's gonna be the radish.
[13:36.56]No, it's probably... It's this one.
[13:40.27]It's Apple's... Telephone is heavier than a... But you're fucking up.
[13:45.07]You're doing real... You're putting real world items in here.
[13:47.77]And it's messing me up.
[13:55.15]An owl is definitely heavier than a plant.
[13:57.46]Right?
[14:04.60]That's the point?
[14:05.72]So it's just supposed to be real world.
[14:08.73]Alright, well a telephone's heavier than cheese.
[14:10.97]What?
[14:29.72]I don't even care.
[14:30.48]We're starting the stream just joking around with a dumb dickhead online test.
[14:35.27]What do I, dog collar match?
[14:36.59]What is this?
[14:42.43]This is not like a fucking actual test.
[14:44.11]This is just somebody made like a jokey game in their spare time.
[14:46.95]How long is my... Why did I decide I wanted to do this today?
[15:05.91]What do the clerks say?
[15:09.43]I'm not even supposed to be at work today, right?
[15:13.80]It's a miracle my computer is still on.
[15:29.01]The devs in the chat.
[15:35.22]Hey, I'm pretty good at the dog callers, don't you think?
[15:55.67]I only missed one of those.
[15:59.51]This is a bit rough.
[16:00.41]Of course it is!
[16:03.15]Oh no.
[16:05.11]Create the correct equation from left to right by clicking on the signs.
[16:08.65]Oh, come on.
[16:09.31]Don't do this to me.
[16:10.97]5 plus 6 equals 30.
[16:12.04]It's the times... 6 times 5 is 6 minus... 6 plus 11 is, uh... 6, 5, 7... 9 plus minus 2 is 7.
[16:23.98]Oh, thank god.
[16:24.50]This is at, like, a literal third grade level.
[16:27.96]5 plus 5 minus 8 5 times 8 minus 8 equals 4 5 minus times plus 35 minus 5 plus 8 equals 35 minus 35 divided by 5 times 8 equals plus 15 36 minus 4 times 1 equals 8
[16:57.99]18 divided by 3 and then times 1 equals 5 5 minus 20 times 4
[17:20.84]Is this hurting my brain?
[17:21.92]I'm just fucking kidding around.
[17:26.52]It's a joke!
[17:29.44]You score.
[17:29.92]Alright, what did I get?
[17:30.54]I don't want to submit it.
[17:33.76]I'm not clicking that button.
[17:40.24]Mad because bad.
[17:41.42]Alright, don't worry.
[17:45.12]We got another one here.
[17:47.14]This one's an actual... This is a unique IQ test.
[17:49.58]It's called Flash Your Brain.
[17:53.84]Just make sure I got it in the right section here.
[18:00.44]Looks good, right?
[18:05.82]Yeah, warning.
[18:06.24]You're going to be flashed here.
[18:07.14]Okay, test.
[18:09.17]Oh, fuck.
[18:09.73]Hold on.
[18:10.55]Is this timer?
[18:11.83]It's not even in the right spot.
[18:18.99]Things like checking on my mood, too.
[18:20.67]Hold on.
[18:21.13]Let's reload it.
[18:27.61]What the fuck does this say?
[18:28.60]Please disable your ad block.
[18:31.36]The game will load faster without an ad block.
[18:36.96]That is such a lie.
[18:39.98]Huh?
[18:42.04]You're telling me that if I didn't have an ad blocker on, the game would load faster?
[18:44.87]I don't even have an ad blocker.
[18:53.95]I don't have an ad blocker.
[19:00.59]I actually don't have that.
[19:04.77]Lies.
[19:05.15]I swear to God.
[19:05.98]I have, I have like, okay.
[19:07.72]I have Kaspersky protection, which is enabled.
[19:10.62]Look, I can prove it.
[19:13.74]I just don't want you to see the rest of the games we have to play tonight.
[19:16.52]Look, I can prove it.
[19:18.39]Look, I can prove it in real time here.
[19:20.05]Can you see?
[19:36.78]See?
[19:37.50]Take a look.
[19:38.84]No, you guys gonna see it all.
[19:40.04]I don't want you to see that.
[19:41.80]Hold on.
[19:45.92]See?
[19:46.34]Right there.
[19:48.34]That's not ad block.
[19:49.80]That's, Kaspersky's like internet protection.
[19:59.35]What?
[19:59.61]That was smart.
[20:05.04]Guys, give me a moment to rebuttal here.
[20:07.84]Hold on.
[20:10.47]Let me give you a second, right?
[20:12.71]So everyone saw the how smart are you test, right?
[20:16.74]I could have written something like brain games or IQ test or online testing, online quiz.
[20:23.23]No, when like a 14-year-old goes to search for this, they type in how smart are you test.
[20:30.01]It's the easiest way to get the keywords how smart are me you test.
[20:36.94]It's keywords.
[20:39.68]We're talking about search engine optimization here, okay?
[20:42.86]Anyways, let's go test.
[20:44.75]What image continues the following sequence?
[20:51.94]It'll be 21.
[20:53.50]What image continues another sequence?
[20:54.94]Okay.
[21:00.78]I'm thinking about this here, 3.
[21:01.78]That's 1, 2, 3, 4.
[21:02.46]And then it's minus, and it's plus 2, and then minus 1.
[21:07.51]So plus 2 would be 3, 4, 5.
[21:09.69]And it's going to be this one over here.
[21:12.65]Okay, one, two, two, quick one, one, two, one, two.
[21:16.73]And flip it sideways, and then flip it around, and then flip it back.
[21:19.31]That means it's gonna be two, one, two, four, two, one, two.
[21:24.07]It's gonna be four, two.
[21:26.22]Okay.
[21:29.40]One, two, three, four.
[21:30.54]You got that in a cube.
[21:31.54]Your three's currently in the blue, and then the four, and then two, and then the two goes around the four.
[21:37.41]Patterns here, so that's bumblebee, bumblebee.
[21:45.71]Looks like we're going to go back to a... I'm going to say we're going to go back to Bumblebee here.
[21:49.31]I think it looks like it could be this one here.
[21:54.92]No, I don't think we're going to go back to Bumblebee here.
[21:57.12]I think it is.
[21:58.18]Complete the pyramid.
[21:58.86]You got it.
[21:59.42]Okay.
[22:01.00]Green, black, green, black, red, green, black, red, green, black, black, black, green, black, black.
[22:05.06]Complete the pyramid.
[22:05.71]This is the Triforce of Wisdom, the Triforce of Courage, and the Triforce of Strength.
[22:11.11]Okay.
[22:13.25]Okay.
[22:17.21]It is definitely this one.
[22:21.73]Fleet of Fervid.
[22:24.27]We got the... It's all about patterns and recognizing them.
[22:31.04]Circle and orange, orange circle.
[22:33.44]Pulls it out of the circle, which means it would have to be... It wouldn't be this one.
[22:37.90]It would have to be this one.
[22:40.08]Got the paint set here.
[22:44.81]This is blue going all the way down, so it's going to have to be blue.
[22:48.39]Which one of these is it going to be?
[22:49.37]It's probably going to be the one that has... It's not going to be this one.
[22:55.05]It spins the colors to seem to be sideways yellows, so it's going to be one of these two.
[23:00.12]That's part of the pattern there.
[23:01.12]Now, what about white?
[23:01.72]It's going to be this one right here, the second one.
[23:03.00]In the next four tasks, you'll be required to remember a situation in 60 seconds and answer the question also in 60 seconds.
[23:09.40]You got it.
[23:11.26]What is it?
[23:12.24]Quiet.
[23:12.48]Quiet.
[23:22.83]Multiples of 11.
[23:30.09]Why am I reading chat?
[23:31.21]What are you doing?
[23:36.47]I can't do this with you guys here.
[23:38.03]Like, I gotta sit down in a quiet room.
[23:39.69]It's all multiples of 10.
[23:54.38]Don't give me, like, the saw music.
[23:55.78]I already lost it.
[24:02.63]What?
[24:06.03]Alright, we get extra computer time.
[24:10.17]It heard me.
[24:10.71]It knows.
[24:18.12]Skip.
[24:18.68]No, I'm not gonna skip.
[24:19.66]I'm gonna get this right.
[24:24.85]I will get this right.
[24:25.79]Don't you worry about that.
[24:30.42]We've got extra time here, so let me just make sure I can remember this.
[24:33.10]I think I'll get it.
[24:50.89]We can skip that now.
[24:52.64]What image was on the previous scheme?
[24:54.22]Okay, let me think about this.
[24:58.14]We had 30... I think there was 20... No, 21, 40.
[25:02.86]There was a 41 here, but... No, which one were these?
[25:07.86]I'm trying to remember.
[25:08.46]I'm trying to pull it out of my brain here.
[25:16.07]Um...
[25:20.71]I'm not sure what it's asking me.
[25:28.31]Okay, I think I got that one correct.
[25:30.85]This is another memory test.
[25:34.46]I'm actually really good with these.
[25:35.50]For those of you that are curious, I actually was IQ tested before.
[25:42.03]And it was enough for me to be able to completely understand patterns and recognize how they function.
[25:51.09]I don't even need to look at this anymore, I don't think.
[25:55.14]What was on the previous stream?
[25:56.64]Well, if I just pull out deduction here and just use the reasonable amount of time that I have.
[26:04.12]Let me think about this.
[26:04.92]I saw a few of these.
[26:06.54]I think it was this one.
[26:07.20]Another memory test.
[26:09.02]This one should be very... You know what?
[26:10.68]I don't even need to look at it for more than a few seconds.
[26:17.22]Okay.
[26:17.70]Sorry.
[26:17.82]I just had a cough there for a sec.
[26:21.52]It was this one here.
[26:22.81]Which was absent?
[26:24.29]I'm not sure which one was in here.
[26:29.05]Pretty sure this blight blue one was not there.
[26:32.91]No, it wasn't.
[26:35.92]Memory test.
[26:37.94]We have quite a few of these.
[26:48.17]It doesn't even... What image was on the previous game?
[27:00.46]Find appropriate part to complete the square.
[27:04.50]See, I'm alright with this one.
[27:05.94]So it's going to spin around.
[27:07.20]It's going to have three staircases.
[27:13.07]And a thick entrance.
[27:17.43]I think it's this one here.
[27:19.03]One, two, three.
[27:20.89]Steep entrance.
[27:23.49]No, it's going to have a little bit of an edge here.
[27:32.74]Why am I reading chat?
[27:34.46]No, it's this one.
[27:37.40]Find appropriate part to complete the circle.
[27:48.55]No, he got it wrong.
[27:49.83]Wait, wait.
[27:51.72]Let me just spin my monitor around.
[27:54.42]It's not this one.
[27:56.20]It's this one.
[27:58.10]It's this one.
[28:00.37]Find the appropriate part to complete the square.
[28:01.61]We need blue on the tip and yellow here.
[28:06.17]So that's fine.
[28:06.99]It's not this one.
[28:10.04]It's either this one or this one.
[28:14.62]What about the red here?
[28:15.42]I don't think it's this one.
[28:20.94]I actually think it might be this one.
[28:24.18]Yeah, it's this one.
[28:24.76]Find the appropriate part to complete the circle.
[28:27.98]I'm just going to spin it around.
[28:32.79]Is this just a joke?
[28:33.93]I mean, the whole fucking stream is a joke.
[28:42.31]You think we're doing this thing seriously?
[28:44.48]It's this one.
[28:48.04]Finally appropriate inside of the cube.
[28:52.22]Now that's just fucking offensive.
[28:53.96]That's just offensive.
[28:56.39]Even if that's the correct one, I'm not going to click on it.
[29:05.33]Literally any shape would complete that circle.
[29:13.47]This is a boring stream.
[29:14.82]Well, blame my computer for fucking sucking.
[29:17.72]And I just clicked on the Satan one because of that guy.
[29:25.38]This is too long.
[29:26.50]I got like 30 tabs up here to go through.
[29:39.18]I have no fucking idea.
[29:40.88]I would need to sit down for like 20 minutes to look at this.
[29:43.74]No, it's probably this one.
[29:57.25]This is gonna be a screamer.
[30:03.53]No, we're playing brain games.
[30:07.78]How many red circles on this movie?
[30:14.13]What is it?
[30:15.01]So just how many red circles are there?
[30:20.81]How many blue squares on this movie?
[30:27.79]Okay.
[30:34.60]How many squares on this movie?
[30:48.12]This is like a headache simulator.
[30:49.62]How many bees are collecting honey flying from flowers to honeycomb or vice versa?
[30:59.54]Oh, I didn't know there was a movie.
[31:02.73]It didn't say this movie.
[31:05.19]How many bees are flying to... All of them?
[31:11.73]Except for this guy?
[31:21.76]I think it's, yeah, no, no, this guy's moving now, too.
[31:24.12]It's all of them.
[31:25.00]All seven of them.
[31:26.76]Find the missing brick.
[31:27.60]I mean, it has to be one of these three.
[31:38.98]So we've got blue.
[31:40.07]Let's just Minesweeper.
[31:42.53]Red, red.
[31:43.73]Green, green.
[31:44.47]Blue, blue.
[31:55.09]Fuck, I really don't... Do you like jazz?
[31:59.19]Jazz music's pretty good.
[32:00.49]It is pretty cool.
[32:02.27]Define the absent triangle, move mouse cursor over the image.
[32:11.64]Oh my god, I don't... Find the absent square.
[32:26.78]This is boring, he didn't get the meme.
[32:28.78]What are you talking about, didn't get the meme?
[32:40.04]Okay, congratulations, you completed the first part of the IQ test.

[32:50.86]Okay, results.
[32:53.90]Okay.
[32:55.60]The results of this test can be found by comparing your score with the following IQ scale.
[32:59.00]The author of this test doesn't pretend to be absolutely exact in estimating your mental skills.
[33:02.74]However, along with your intelligence, you must have a sense of humor!
[33:10.41]Oh!
[33:10.55]Oh, excuse me!
[33:12.67]Oh, excuse me!
[33:17.61]This result's pretty poor.
[33:19.83]This is average result.
[33:21.61]Oh, this is a good result.
[33:23.97]High intelligence.
[33:25.97]With such high IQ, you are able to manage large companies, but it is not enough to prove format theoremary in 60 seconds, by the way.
[33:34.92]Full version of this test will include such a task.
[33:40.44]Very high intelligence.
[33:42.16]You have to apply to Mensa organization.
[33:44.20]This is union of people with very high IQ.
[33:50.67]Alright, let's go to the next one.
[33:52.38]Get me the fuck out of here.
[33:53.86]I like, okay, hold on a minute.
[33:57.56]If I, if I like, I feel like this isn't a good test.
[34:06.93]No, it's not.
[34:07.61]This is an awful IQ test.
[34:09.01]An IQ test takes like six hours, not like 22 minutes.
[34:13.09]Alright, let's go.
[34:19.34]Next one.
[34:21.95]You weren't supposed to see it right off the bat, but this is called monkey drive math.
[34:34.88]You drive around and you drive your car around and run into barrels.
[34:41.58]Then I had to do it.
[34:43.62]You guys know why, right?
[34:44.94]Of course everybody knows why.
[34:45.90]Okay, multiply to get to 14 to 17.
[34:49.96]Press the left and right arrow keys to steer.
[34:51.40]Press the up and down arrow keys to speed up.
[34:53.06]You can also use spacebar to jump over barrels.
[34:55.10]Okay, let's go.
[34:57.89]Drive into the barrels whose equation equals the number on the car.
[35:02.53]You got it.
[35:03.39]So I just gotta get the right one.
[35:06.19]Begin the race.
[35:06.71]Go.
[35:09.26]Alright, I need to get 14.
[35:12.04]14 times 1 is 14.
[35:12.54]4 times...
[35:21.75]Fourteen!
[35:23.05]That's not fourteen!
[35:24.77]Seven times two!
[35:26.33]Fourteen!
[35:26.83]Hit this other fucking car!
[35:31.07]Alright, well he's having trouble, like me.
[35:37.50]Fourteen!
[35:43.92]I got a bonus!
[35:45.72]You got all the correct answers, +2 bananas!
[35:49.37]Now you gotta get to 50.
[35:50.29]No, we're done.
[35:51.29]That was quick.
[35:52.83]This one's called Bus Driver Math.
[35:59.61]Don't ask me what this is.
[36:03.10]You think I was fucking around when I told you guys that I had like 30 tabs open?
[36:06.86]We're gonna be here for a little while.
[36:07.88]Okay, instructions.
[36:11.66]Calculate whether the money paid by the passengers is enough.
[36:15.34]Okay.

[36:34.79]That is a child.
[36:37.59]Child is, no, no, sorry.
[36:40.15]Not enough.
[36:47.78]Is this like a fucking eight-year-old driving the car?
[36:54.44]This kid's definitely not old enough to operate a vehicle.
[36:56.86]Especially, like, not even... Then he probably has not a class... Wait, hold on.

[37:26.50]Apparently, if you get it wrong, then you get hurt.
[37:28.32]No, that's enough.
[37:34.06]This is level one.
[37:34.90]Can I skip to, like, another level?
[37:36.00]Yeah, that's enough.
[37:45.61]How could you fuck that up?
[37:47.31]She went back around and wants to pay again.
[37:48.95]Okay, please...

[43:40.41]This is just the impossible quiz, but made by somebody that was a fan.
[43:43.07]This is brain age.
[44:04.68]I'm going to find out how old my brain is.
[44:11.92]Let's begin the brain age test.
[44:16.58]Hello, welcome to the brain age test.
[44:17.74]My name is Professor Fumble.
[44:19.79]I calculate your brain age based on a variety of factors.
[44:21.83]Simply complete three tests to find out your real brain age.
[44:26.49]Let's begin with test number one.
[44:29.11]Test number one will check your short term memory.
[44:31.89]You'll be shown a series of numbers briefly then remember these numbers.
[44:35.33]The numbers will then turn into circles.
[44:36.76]Click the circles in the same order as the numbers.
[44:39.72]Click as quickly as you can while still being accurate.
[44:42.54]Let's go.
[44:44.40]Okay, so that's one, two, three.
[44:49.86]Okay.
[44:56.39]One, two, three, five.
[45:12.97]Great, you finished test one.
[45:13.95]Let's move on to the second test.
[45:17.19]Test two will measure your brain's processing power.
[45:22.05]You will see a word printed in text.
[45:23.95]This word will also have its own color.
[45:28.12]In the above example, the word is green, but the color is red.
[45:32.02]Under the word is an instruction.
[45:34.86]Follow the instruction and click the answer from the three options.
[45:39.82]this example the answer would be red click the color okay let's go blue click the word click the color click the color it's pink click the word that's red yeah test two is finished just one more test remaining
[46:07.08]Test three will measure your ability to retain numbers in basic arithmetic.
[46:12.50]This one's easy.
[46:13.10]Simple as solve the sum.
[46:14.20]Five cents.
[46:14.88]Fuck.

[47:52.97]It's the math dyslexia.
[47:58.10]Why am I getting cheeseburgers?

[49:48.78]That's like the oldest trick in the book.
[49:52.18]Which country is largest in terms of land mass?
[49:54.33]Australia, Italy, Peru, Spain.
[49:56.65]It's Australia.

[50:37.08]It is a country.
[50:38.18]Australia is a country and a continent.
[50:42.43]It's both.

[55:16.50]Okay, so that would be... 12 times 10 is 120.
[55:18.56]That's a year.
[55:18.96]So it'd be... 1,200.

[58:34.11]It's not France.
[58:34.91]That's the Soviet Union.
[58:36.26]Which is not a prime number.
[58:37.36]A prime number is a number that can be divided into itself for things that are divided by two.
[58:47.58]It's not 13.
[58:47.88]13 is not a prime number.
[58:52.40]Okay.
[58:52.78]So...
[59:08.51]You're smarter than 6% of the population.
[59:11.45]Alright, let's just move on to... Fuck all this intelligent shit.
[59:14.47]You know what I mean?
[59:14.91]Like, who cares?
[59:15.53]You're smarter than this guy.
[59:16.75]You're more intelligent than this guy.
[59:18.61]No, what matters is what element are you, is what matters.
[59:23.75]All this bullshit.
[59:27.44]None of that matters.
[59:28.30]It's not about how smart you are.
[59:29.80]It's about internalizing your spirit.
[59:38.84]Let's see.
[59:39.28]Hold on, I gotta resize this.
[59:45.08]It's all about the numbers, Jeremy.
[59:46.36]It's all about how smart you are and how brilliant you are.
[59:50.56]No, it's about your fucking spirit.
[59:56.40]Alright, let's find out what I am.
[59:57.94]Okay, question one out of 15.
[60:01.08]You're at home alone late one night and there's a thunderstorm going on outside when the power goes out.
[60:05.27]This happened two days ago.
[60:06.91]So I can give you a true answer to this.
[60:10.96]This happened two days... You know, I got a lot of shit from my hair.
[60:19.11]People were saying like, well, you look like a fucking... You look like a real, like, villain.
[60:22.53]So I slicked it back today.
[60:25.37]So I actually look like a fucking real, like, 80s movie villain.
[60:28.35]Slicked back with oil.
[60:31.51]Sometimes you gotta play the part, you know what I'm saying?
[60:41.99]Let's go down here.
[60:42.49]Alright, you're at home late one night.
[60:49.35]This happened two days ago.
[60:50.51]Okay, what do you do when the power goes out during a thunderstorm?
[60:53.56]Just sit there in the dark and calmly wait for the storm to pass.
[60:59.44]Maybe go over to the window and watch the lightning flash.
[61:03.48]Shrug and go find a flashlight to read by.
[61:06.82]Curl up under the blankets in your bed while you try to block out the roaring thunder.
[61:10.29]No, what am I, a dog?
[61:12.38]Look around for something to hide under while worrying about your chances of getting struck by lightning.
[61:19.74]I would do one of these two things.
[61:23.32]Go over to the window and watch the lightning or I would just shrug and just get a flashlight and just sit there.
[61:28.47]I'd probably watch it for a little while.
[61:29.89]It'd be like interesting to me for a little while.
[61:37.49]Which of the following comes closest to your greatest fear?
[61:41.84]Drowning or suffocating, dying of starvation or thirst, flying or falling, public speaking or fire?
[61:51.34]Hold on, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[61:53.51]I understand this one.
[61:56.17]I understand this one.
[61:57.55]I understand this one.
[61:59.67]Public speaking or fire?
[62:03.73]Enclosed spaces or an animal attack?
[62:10.75]You know what?
[62:11.31]Let's be real about this.
[62:16.99]I'm fine.
[62:17.37]I'm doing public speaking right now.
[62:20.43]There's nothing wrong with that.
[62:22.04]Fire, on the other hand, that's scary.
[62:25.34]And I'm not afraid of animals.
[62:27.82]Animals don't scare me.
[62:28.76]Fire doesn't scare me.
[62:31.22]Flying doesn't scare me.
[62:33.86]Drowning, suffocating, that doesn't scare me.
[62:37.73]Alright, but dying of thirst or starvation...
[62:40.28]I could see that that would be pretty close.
[62:42.72]That's pretty terrifying.
[62:45.12]By the way, those of you that said that it was bullshit, that I didn't actually have an update, excuse me.
[62:50.10]What is that?
[62:53.68]You think I lie to you guys on this stream?
[62:56.22]Dying of starvation or thirst would probably be it.
[62:58.06]Let's go.
[62:58.36]Next question, please.
[63:01.13]What would you rather gain without losing anything?
[63:06.31]Strength, knowledge, time, peace, or power?
[63:25.63]Which of the following groups of color do you find most appealing?
[63:30.99]Green and brown, red and gold, white and aqua, violet and pale blue, indigo and cerulean.
[63:40.39]That hair is whack.
[63:42.19]I know, I did it for a joke.
[63:45.39]You guys talking shit about my hair every day.
[63:47.35]I did it as like a fuck me.
[63:48.67]I'm gonna say
[64:00.99]Probably violet, probably pale blue.
[64:02.75]White, oh no, white and aqua.
[64:05.55]I like that.
[64:05.99]Okay, here we go, keep going.
[64:07.65]If you and your family and friends were going on a camping trip, what would you probably spend most of your time doing?
[64:13.55]Swimming, boating, offing yourself?
[64:15.87]Oh no, off by yourself.
[64:17.71]Reading or something.
[64:19.23]Whoa.
[64:20.05]Sitting by the campfire or cooking things over it.
[64:22.76]Walking, hiking, enjoying, no, fuck that.
[64:25.46]Watching the sunset, glad to get away from the bustle of everyday life.
[64:28.14]Probably that.
[64:29.26]Or swimming.
[64:35.14]Probably swimming.
[64:35.76]That's fun to get in the water and move around.
[64:38.24]No, just watching the sunset.
[64:41.42]What's your greatest strength?
[64:43.63]You are steady and reliable.
[64:45.35]No.
[64:45.95]You are caring and passionate.
[64:47.23]Yes.
[64:48.05]You are strong of character.
[64:49.27]Yes.
[64:49.95]You're optimistic and friendly.
[64:51.37]Yes.
[64:52.09]You are wise and give good advice.
[64:53.81]No.
[64:54.63]So what do you got?
[64:56.13]These three.
[64:58.11]Am I more caring and passionate than I am strong of character?
[65:01.50]Am I more optimistic and friendly than I am strong?
[65:08.98]It's probably one of these two.
[65:12.22]You are strong of character.
[65:15.64]Optimistic.
[65:16.46]Compassion.
[65:16.90]I mean, it could be any of these things.
[65:20.96]Friendly.
[65:21.58]Optimistic.
[65:22.04]I'm going to say I'm strong of character.
[65:27.65]That's what I would do.
[65:31.31]What's your greatest weakness?
[65:32.81]Your wild mood swings.
[65:35.27]I don't even need to read the other ones.
[65:37.33]Your negative attitude.
[65:38.65]Not really.
[65:39.43]Your temper.
[65:40.82]Your inability to sit still and be quiet.
[65:43.14]Your stubbornness.
[65:43.94]Your temper.
[65:45.68]It's all of them.
[65:46.26]Can I pick all of them but temper?
[65:47.90]No, but it's every one of them.
[65:52.06]Oh, God damn it.
[65:53.40]It could be any one of these.
[65:56.03]Except for like negative attitude.
[65:57.47]I don't really have a negative attitude.
[65:59.05]I don't.
[66:02.48]It's definitely this one.
[66:05.85]It is.
[66:07.49]Pick a word.
[66:08.09]Hmm, I wonder why they want me to do this.
[66:11.82]People game these systems all the time.
[66:13.52]Like, oh, hmm, I think flame is my favorite word because I want to share to my friends that I got fire.
[66:19.86]It's like, come on, man.
[66:21.64]I'm going to pick, I'm going to do it for real.
[66:23.86]Snowflake, flame, droplet, leaf, cloud.
[66:26.05]Say it out loud and close your eyes.
[66:27.61]Snowflake, flame, droplet, leaf, cloud.
[66:30.33]Cloud, droplet, snowflake, cloud, cloud.
[66:36.65]What's your dream eye color?
[66:41.88]I don't have it.
[66:44.14]People like dream about their eye colors.
[66:47.62]Hmm.
[66:50.32]By the way, I love over here.
[66:53.00]Look at this.
[66:55.47]Report illegal content.
[66:59.07]The fuck does that mean?
[67:05.45]I mean, green eyes are cool.
[67:07.95]I like my eyes though.
[67:13.06]Okay, I have light blue eyes.
[67:15.02]If I don't have a dream eye color, can I just pick the eye color I currently have?
[67:21.82]What is your preferred sense?
[67:23.18]Sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch.
[67:28.89]It's probably hearing.
[67:31.17]It's definitely hearing because like honestly you see me with the one ear button.
[67:33.85]It's hearing for sure.
[67:36.49]Which situation would you find the most difficult to cope with?
[67:39.98]Being emotionally hurt by someone close to you.
[67:43.08]Being overwhelmed by problems.
[67:44.74]That happens every fucking day.
[67:45.96]Don't worry.
[67:46.94]I got that under control.
[67:49.06]Being used, being abandoned, being humiliated in public.
[67:53.30]That happens all the fucking time.
[67:54.41]That's happened like five times tonight.
[67:56.11]So that's, I'm okay with that.
[67:59.99]Hmm.
[68:01.91]It's probably, it's probably like one, two or three here.
[68:09.69]no being you being abandoned it probably is probably like being hurt like emotionally by somebody that you would never expect would do something like that to you that's pretty like up yeah I don't like that one uh how or where do you seek comfort when you're upset
[68:31.44]In a pet or stuffed animal?
[68:33.22]That's a little... Yeah, but this one.
[68:35.78]I don't know about that one.
[68:37.88]No, not a good cry.
[68:40.16]No.
[68:41.24]You know what?
[68:41.56]I do the best.
[68:42.65]Like Otto.
[68:44.85]When Otto is around, he makes me feel much better.
[68:49.53]In a pet.
[68:50.87]Which of the following animals do you find most appealing?
[68:54.09]Stallion, eagle, polar bear, dolphin, or stallion?
[68:58.26]Hmm.
[69:00.60]Not sure here.
[69:02.68]One of the two stallions.
[69:03.84]Or a polar bear, eagle, dolphin.
[69:07.04]No, dolphins are dumb.
[69:09.56]Polar bears are dumb.
[69:11.45]Stallions are dumb.
[69:12.45]Eagle, eagle.
[69:13.37]They can fly.
[69:15.55]What is your favorite season?
[69:16.63]Summer, autumn, winter, not sure, or spring?
[69:24.24]The easy answer here is summer.
[69:26.60]It's probably spring though.
[69:27.54]Because spring is like a good combination between nice out and not really hot.
[69:32.84]It's not cold.
[69:33.74]It's not too hot.
[69:34.58]It's just right.
[69:35.83]Spring is the Goldilocks just right porridge of all the seasons.
[69:40.67]Spring.
[69:42.11]Last question.
[69:43.47]If an artist were to paint a stylized representation of you, how would you want to look in the painting?

[70:08.29]You're an optimist and you tend to look at the bright side of things.
[70:10.93]Because of this, you have many friends who are attracted to your outgoing personality.
[70:16.20]You also value self-expression.
[70:18.65]and would probably enjoy writing or art or maybe both.
[70:21.69]You hate being tied down with obligations, so you try to keep your life fairly simplified.
[70:26.19]You love to have fun, and you brighten everybody's day with your smile.
[70:32.82]Only 20% got this.
[70:33.38]For another 20%, I'm ice.
[70:41.74]You are solitary and quiet and would probably rather be in your room reading a book than with a large group.
[70:47.38]Justice is important to you and you won't hesitate to stand up for others.
[70:51.85]Though quiet, you are strong and determined and never give up.
[70:55.59]Your unique personality is admired by those around you.
[70:59.55]Uh, no.
[71:00.29]That's not right.
[71:01.31]This is like, you know, horoscopes.
[71:03.74]When you read the first part of the horoscope and you're like, holy shit, that's so me.
[71:08.16]And you go down like two or three paragraphs and it's not you at all.
[71:12.26]They just make sure they give you every single self-confirmation that they possibly could.
[71:16.82]Oh yeah, I am like wicked outgoing and I'm like fun.
[71:20.56]Oh, that is me.
[71:21.42]I can't wait to tell everybody.

[71:23.84]Every single one of these is the same thing.
[71:26.35]It's just find the one that you think that you are and which, look at this.
[71:31.45]You could be any one of these.
[71:36.84]Okay, our users got the following profile.
[71:38.61]I mostly got this one.

[71:59.77]It's a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them that are, in fact, vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people.
[72:12.82]Yeah.

[73:24.09]I don't like this.
[73:25.97]It needs to be like more full.
[73:27.03]There we go.
[73:29.75]How are your friends?
[73:31.92]They are goofy.
[73:33.49]A lot like me.
[73:34.17]They're kind of mean.
[73:35.27]Awkward, but classy.
[73:36.25]I don't have any friends.
[73:37.13]They're fun, but odd.
[73:38.07]I would say that my friends are fun, but they're a little odd.
[73:45.39]Favorite.
[73:45.91]What's my favorite SpongeBob quote?
[73:54.24]God damn it, SpongeBob.
[73:55.68]Who says that?
[73:57.02]Who said that?
[74:01.08]They don't swear in SpongeBob.
[74:02.59]I've never heard that.
[74:05.65]God damn it, SpongeBob!
[74:07.57]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[74:08.89]Got any hobbies?
[74:09.53]Okay.
[74:10.19]Counting stuff.
[74:12.11]Musical, martial arts, avoiding certain people, planning stuff, hunting, or bubble blowing.
[74:24.48]He's fucking naked.
[74:27.60]Counting stuff.
[74:29.45]The rest of this stuff sucks.
[74:33.85]This is absolutely Squidward.
[74:35.27]Alright, let's see if we can figure this out.
[74:36.82]SpongeBob.
[74:41.18]Sandy.
[74:42.14]Why am I holding up three?
[74:43.24]I just said two.
[74:45.92]SpongeBob, Sandy.
[74:48.06]Who's counting stuff?
[74:49.00]That's Mr. Krabs.
[74:51.63]Right?
[74:53.11]Squidward.
[74:55.27]Musical.
[74:56.37]Squidward, probably again.
[74:59.13]Hunting.
[75:00.31]I'm going to go with counting stuff.
[75:01.49]That sounds like fun.
[75:03.44]Where do you often find yourself?
[75:04.80]At work?
[75:06.76]Or at an orchestra?
[75:07.96]In a shop?
[75:08.64]Home?
[75:09.17]In a school?
[75:09.87]I'm home.
[75:12.43]How many relatives do you have?
[75:14.09]I have a few, but very far away.
[75:15.91]At least 10,000.
[75:18.89]Mommy and Daddy?
[75:20.31]Oh, you know.
[75:20.92]Regular family with cousins and stuff.
[75:24.22]I don't know.
[75:24.80]Don't care.
[75:25.28]Well, I'm only connected to one or two of them.
[75:28.34]Oh, you know.
[75:30.24]Regular family with cousins and stuff.
[75:34.55]I love that these are made by, like, kids.
[75:37.73]Like, it's perfect.
[75:39.53]How do you live with my beloved wife and husband?
[75:43.55]Like my pet, alone with my ego.
[75:45.37]I got some company time to time.
[75:48.25]Alone, but it's still fun.
[75:49.93]That depends.
[75:51.19]Yeah, that depends.
[75:51.93]It could be any day.
[75:52.57]My friends could come over.
[75:53.36]I could have family over.
[75:54.30]How high is your IQ?
[76:01.28]Upper average.
[76:04.07]Last question.
[76:04.63]What do you work with?

[76:17.13]This is art right here.
[76:18.59]I'm doing it right now.
[76:19.59]This is performance art.
[76:21.39]You guys don't understand?
[76:22.17]This is a living painting that you're seeing.
[76:26.53]Michelangelo, Leonardo, Da Vinci, they're all dead.
[76:29.78]I remain.
[76:30.56]You understand?
[76:31.48]I remain as a performance artist.
[76:34.75]Art and culture!
[76:35.41]Well, I got Mrs. Puff.
[76:58.92]Okay, you are probably a teacher in a class.
[77:02.18]There is this one student you just want to strangle, but can't.
[77:06.89]When you get angry, you easily blow up and let it all burst out.
[77:12.21]Most of the time you spend alone searching for love.
[77:16.03]You know, it's funny, like a half of this is real.
[77:19.15]Look at this.
[77:19.65]This is what happens.
[77:21.75]You guys are the students.
[77:30.67]This one student, you just want to strangle but can't.
[77:38.60]I love that immediate turnaround.
[77:40.16]You want to strangle but can't.
[77:42.32]Dial it back a little bit.
[77:43.40]A few notches.
[77:47.80]Okay.
[77:50.32]I'm going to take a piss.
[77:51.72]I'll be right back.
[77:52.34]I'm having a bunch of fun tonight.
[77:54.54]You guys having fun?
[77:57.61]I'll be right back.
[78:01.50]I don't have the song up here yet.

[80:33.55]OK, we've got more to do.
[80:37.96]We've got more to do.
[80:39.14]Let me move this over here.
[80:48.90]This actually might be pretty fun.
[80:50.06]This next one, it's going to be fun to do this.
[80:53.08]I'm looking forward to this next one.
[80:56.40]So the way this one works is, hold on.
[81:08.80]Mm-hmm.
[81:09.52]Okay.
[81:10.66]So this one is going to play various NES theme songs or video game sounds.
[81:17.65]I've got to guess if I can get them correct.
[81:19.73]This is regular Nintendo.
[81:28.36]This one's definitely a screamer.
[81:32.26]No, this is a gamer quiz.
[81:40.48]I actually am curious.
[81:42.57]Let's be like for real.
[81:44.71]I'm curious as to how well I'm going to do on this one.
[81:48.43]There's one for Super Nintendo as well.
[81:49.95]We're going to do this.
[81:50.59]Alright, here we go.
[81:52.41]Got to guess the right music, what game it is from.
[81:56.14]This is not going to be a screamer.
[81:57.44]I've already opened it for more than... It's been open the whole time.
[82:01.78]Okay.
[82:01.98]Let's see if it's loud.

[90:28.63]No fucking idea.
[90:34.51]Is it Final Fantasy?
[90:36.83]Because that was supposed to be the last fantasy, right?
[90:39.03]The final one.
[90:40.29]There it is, okay.
[90:41.39]Let me try to get this one without this.
[90:44.11]I think I can get it.

[91:37.09]Rhymes with radius.
[91:39.43]Grad...
[91:47.02]Instead of rhymes with radius you should have said anything else because you just have to put a G on there Hideo Kojima's vision taken and bastardized Metal Gear?

[94:21.08]What do you mean that's not even close?
[94:23.76]That's in the same realm.

[94:43.01]Is it joust?
[94:45.82]It's just balloon pop.

[95:15.41]Is it F0?
[95:17.90]This game was pretty rad for its time.
[95:19.82]But that's not a hint.
[95:21.02]That's like a personal opinion of the game.
[95:24.32]Rad racer.
[95:28.90]Oh, it was a hint.
[95:33.28]It was a hint.
[95:35.70]Okay.

[96:09.22]I know it.
[96:12.42]This game, based on a TV show, had music from the TV show.
[96:20.91]The main protagonist is a duck.
[96:26.22]Ugh.
[96:28.96]There's no food in this fucking game.
[96:31.41]DuckTales, what a classic.
[96:32.57]I don't even know it.
[96:36.47]This game popularized backtracking after gaining power-ups.
[96:41.83]Pokémon!
[97:01.22]It's the wrong one.
[97:02.34]What Pokémon is this one?
[97:13.89]There it is.
[97:27.32]Pokémon Stadium.
[97:30.87]How to feed... They haven't made a fucking Metroid in like 10 years.
[97:40.80]How was I supposed to know?
[97:41.74]She's only been in like Smash Brothers.

[98:15.20]Because this is, uh, you guys want to keep doing this?
[98:18.26]Because look at all these.
[98:20.22]We got a lot to do.
[98:22.12]You want to do another one of these video game quizzes?
[98:24.82]With music?
[98:26.89]You liking this or you want me to move on?
[98:31.63]Yeah?
[98:33.67]It's fairly interesting, I'm enjoying myself.
[98:37.94]I'm having fun.
[98:39.96]It's pretty cool.
[98:43.92]So this is 16-bit era games.
[98:49.00]So this could be SEGA, this could be Super Nintendo.
[98:54.33]I feel like I might do a little bit better at this one.
[98:59.37]Although, who knows?
[99:00.25]That could be a total fabrication.
[99:01.87]Alright, let's go.
[99:02.37]Pick a question and start with number one.
[99:04.81]And I get to type my answer right here.
[99:06.15]So, let's go.
[99:12.19]That's Sonic.
[99:14.15]Sonic?
[99:16.74]Oh, I don't... Okay.
[99:19.52]That's it.
[99:19.90]This one's way nicer and flashier than the other one.
[99:22.58]Alright.
[99:24.73]I don't know I don't know this one either You know, we have to use some hints
[100:04.92]I thought I was gonna be better at this, I'm way worse at these ones.
[100:11.79]Fuck.
[100:22.03]Wow, I don't know.
[100:29.22]This is harsh.
[100:29.90]Like, that almost hit me.
[100:52.63]Gotta get one here.
[100:53.39]See, the issue is I never owned a SEGA Genesis, so half these I'm not gonna even... I would never have even wanted to know or knew.
[101:01.65]What?
[101:01.95]Tin, we got a hint back here?
[101:06.65]This is SEGA Genesis.
[101:09.21]I don't know.
[101:10.47]I'll get this one.
[101:11.23]Hold on.
[101:12.30]Power Rangers.
[101:22.73]Got it.
[101:23.15]This game was awesome.
[101:23.97]Super Nintendo Power Rangers video game.
[101:29.33]Guys, this is side-scrolling beatin' up.
[101:30.71]This game was really fun.
[101:32.07]Harvest Moon?
[101:52.71]You can always tell when it's SEGA Genesis when it sounds awful.
[102:01.98]SEGA Genesis music and sounds always sounded like they were coming out of a tin can.
[102:06.64]Through somebody's blanket holding over their mouth.
[102:21.75]I don't know.
[102:31.92]I have it up here.
[102:32.74]I just don't have it.
[102:35.22]I wonder what system this is for!
[102:42.00]Why does every SEGA Genesis song have to sound like the intro to Seinfeld?
[102:47.91]They're the same songs!
[103:11.77]I don't know.
[103:14.65]We're gonna have to start using the hints.
[103:17.56]It's Earthworm Jim.
[103:18.60]Don't even need a single other second.
[103:21.14]One of my favorite characters ever.
[103:22.74]That's a good one.
[103:23.52]There he is, Mr. Jim.
[103:35.78]I'm like bobbing my head like, yeah, I like this one.
[103:43.44]I don't know though.
[103:46.12]I have no idea.
[103:48.54]These are all gonna need hints.
[103:49.94]Altered Beast.
[103:51.46]I forgot about that one.
[103:52.34]Don't forget about Altered Beast.
[103:53.84]I'm gonna use that Vincent Price at the very beginning to yell at me when you know it's Altered Beast.
[104:15.34]That's not a whole lot to go on.
[104:16.58]I don't know.
[104:20.80]This one sounds familiar.
[104:22.56]My member berries are dancing.
[104:25.62]Oh god.
[104:26.42]What is it?
[104:46.99]Why was I going to say Boogerman?
[104:59.30]I don't know.
[105:09.61]I don't know.
[105:19.66]That's like WrestleMania.
[105:23.34]Which WWF is this?
[105:26.36]Royal Rumble?
[105:32.40]It's one of them.
[105:41.43]Fuck.
[105:47.33]I got 4 out of like 30.
[105:55.16]I don't know.
[105:59.53]I should know this one.
[106:00.57]Really.
[106:05.27]Oh, I need to know this one.
[106:07.27]This is such a classic.
[106:09.75]Do the top row first.
[106:14.52]I'm trying not to re-chat, so sorry.
[106:31.14]All you need is the first three notes to know what Zelda is.
[106:36.38]It's gone, I don't know.
[107:06.06]I know this one.
[107:07.82]I know this one!
[107:09.66]Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone!
[107:17.26]Thank you!
[107:18.06]Just kidding.
[107:21.36]It's a magical Mickey Mouse thing, right?
[107:26.71]That's the magical Mickey Mouse's magical journey.
[107:31.29]No, wait, that... Is that Donkey Kong Country?
[107:35.73]Yes, it is.
[107:36.14]Okay.
[108:13.21]No, not punch up.
[108:14.23]Super punch up.
[108:15.03]No, it's not.
[108:19.86]God damn it.
[108:25.40]God damn it!
[108:31.85]Come on, I know this one.
[108:48.88]I'm pissed.
[108:49.38]I know what this is.
[108:53.93]What was that?
[108:59.56]I have plenty of points.
[109:00.58]That's Symphony of the Night.
[109:24.64]I'm getting a lot of these wrong.
[109:25.90]Yeah, I don't know any of these.
[109:44.63]I should though.
[109:46.78]I really should know these.
[109:55.58]That's King Arthur.
[109:59.58]King Arthur's Court.
[110:02.20]Was that even a video game, or was that a fucking, like, docu-series on History Channel?
[110:07.68]Wrong system!
[110:31.09]Got that one.
[110:32.45]All the first party Nintendo games I'll get.
[110:53.83]Except for Dr. Mario and Metroid.
[110:55.73]No, that is correct.
[110:57.33]You're right.
[111:05.27]I mean, I just know that song.
[111:06.59]Forget about the name of the game.
[111:08.13]I just know that that's the Lion King.
[111:09.57]I don't know.
[111:11.44]How do you spell Aladdin?
[111:13.36]How do you spell Aladdin?
[111:45.07]How do you spell Aladdin?
[111:56.60]Ah, there we go.
[111:57.30]Aladdin.
[111:58.42]How do you spell Madden?

[112:17.37]I think I can get this one Superhero something with a superhero
[112:47.57]I don't know.
[112:50.55]I don't know very many of these.

[113:22.55]What?
[113:25.87]Hold on.
[113:28.97]Wallace and Gromit.
[113:32.84]That really was Wallace and Gromit.
[113:56.87]I mean, is this like, is this video games or test your knowledge of recognizing TV and movie shows?
[114:02.66]Animaniacs.
[114:10.30]They're bringing back the Animaniacs?
[114:18.14]Are they really?
[114:30.28]What was that circus music?
[114:31.42]I don't know.
[114:34.82]This is like... That is just a nutcracker.
[114:59.10]Did they make a video game?
[115:02.74]The Racker!
[115:03.28]One of my favorite video games ever made.
[115:19.51]Please play it if you've never played it before.
[115:26.26]It's one of the best games ever made.
[115:28.93]I'll get that every fucking time.
[115:30.75]I'll play the whole song.
[115:31.51]Is there an option where I can have them play the whole song?
[115:46.80]I know this one, too.
[115:48.14]I just can't get it.
[115:51.00]You want to play Chrono Trigger, but eh.
[115:53.99]Do it.
[115:55.25]It's great.
[115:59.48]Um... What is it?
[115:59.92]What is it?
[116:00.24]It's a game with a... It's a scary game on Super Nintendo.
[116:02.44]Oh, what?
[116:02.64]I just...
[116:28.89]I just clicked the screen accidentally and got the- It's Metroid!
[116:31.94]I never would have guessed that.
[116:33.20]Ever.
[116:34.34]Something in my eye.
[116:44.21]Those sounds, I can hear them.
[116:45.67]Let me say this again.
[116:49.35]Shit.
[116:51.23]I need to know if this is how I'm gonna drive you crazy.
[116:53.35]It's Mega Man.
[116:53.93]Mega Man!
[116:56.07]Mega Man X!
[116:57.79]Mega Man X2!
[116:59.91]Mega Man... Mega Man 7, Mega Man 8, Mega Man 6, Mega Man 5, Mega Man 4, Mega Man 3, Mega Man 9, Mega Man 8.
[117:04.27]Mega Man X3, Mega Man X2, Mega Man X. Ow!
[117:28.74]We're gonna start using hints.
[117:39.74]Oh my god.
[117:44.38]Um... I... Nobody's... I know this.
[117:48.44]This is gonna drive me crazy.
[117:52.38]I've played this.
[117:54.74]Zombies ate my neighbors?
[117:55.79]Zombies ate my neighbors, right?
[118:02.40]Yes!
[118:03.69]Got it!
[118:09.56]Sometimes I know things.
[118:10.70]Sometimes.
[118:15.08]Let's turn on the time.
[118:20.20]Yeah, by far the best beat-em-up that I've ever played.
[118:22.90]So if you get a chance to play Turtles in Time, don't play the remastered one.
[118:25.58]It's absolute garbage.
[118:26.91]Play the original one that was for Super Nintendo.
[118:29.21]Get it on ME later if you have to.
[118:30.35]It's the best side-scrolling beat-em-up that's ever been made.
[118:43.17]This is the nostalgia... This turned into the nostalgia stream.
[118:46.17]It wasn't intentional.
[118:49.34]It was more so to... Oh, let me see.
[118:56.18]We were just killing time because my computer sucks.
[118:59.26]But it turned into this.
[119:06.29]And this one... Now we just need a guy to say... And we'll be fine.
[119:20.55]I don't know.
[119:41.08]Jerm is waiting for chat to answer it.
[119:42.78]No, I'm not.
[119:45.08]I can't do that.
[119:48.93]That's cheating.
[119:53.63]How would I have known about the Ocarina of Time?
[119:56.91]Huh?
[119:57.25]I didn't... Nobody said that.
[119:58.43]It's the Moon song from DuckTales.
[120:03.47]Some would argue it's the best video game song to ever exist.
[120:07.80]I don't know about that, but I think there's a few that could hold that up, you know?
[120:28.32]I saw these already.
[120:29.22]Let's get down here.
[120:30.88]Almost done with the first pass.
[120:36.63]I need to know what this is.
[120:37.43]I don't care.
[120:43.87]Micro Machines?
[120:44.67]I don't... What is this?
[120:49.91]What is this?
[120:53.61]Rock and Roll Racing.
[120:57.63]I have never played that game before and I'm okay with cheating.
[121:07.90]That's all you're gonna give me?
[121:08.62]What?
[121:12.22]That's a Blizzard game?
[121:13.24]Is it really?
[121:13.70]I don't know.
[121:28.73]usually get them in the first like 10 seconds not even like the first like three seconds if you don't know what it is you're probably not gonna know what it is give a second
[122:00.40]The Lost Vikings.
[122:02.22]That's also a Blizzard game.
[122:04.70]It hurts.
[122:05.28]Home Alone?
[122:06.06]The Home Alone game?
[122:52.51]Windows firewall your virus protection is off.
[122:57.33]Okay What Why did that happen Virus game
[123:16.56]Okay, uh... What?
[123:20.20]Well, you can stop doing that now.
[123:22.16]That'd be great.
[123:28.29]Hold on a second, get... What the fuck is going on right now?
[123:34.39]What's going on?
[123:35.35]What are you talking about?
[123:38.43]Oh god, here comes a blue screen.
[123:42.41]I think this is the computer trying to desperately not blue screen.
[123:49.09]What the fuck is happening right now?
[123:57.78]Uh, that, what, I've never heard that sound before.
[124:02.00]It's just opening random programs.
[124:04.62]My computer's been taken over.
[124:07.08]It's opening and closing random programs.
[124:11.25]I'm gonna get like ransomware on stream.
[124:19.90]Look what happened to my hair too.
[124:22.82]You make one joke and you look like fucking Toad from Mario.
[124:29.23]Okay.
[124:32.57]Well.
[124:34.37]How are we doing?
[124:43.95]Are we gonna do like a virus scan on stream?
[124:46.85]I just did this.
[124:52.40]I think my computer's just fucked up.
[124:58.97]You guys thought I was bullshitting you.
[125:00.39]You guys thought I was like fucking around.
[125:01.89]You thought I was just making all this shit up.
[125:12.38]Everybody thought I was pulling every- You thought I was pulling your leg.
[125:30.73]Show the screen.
[125:32.51]Hold on.
[125:38.47]Give me a second.
[125:43.33]I thought that was somebody in the computer just coming to get me.
[125:48.00]Somebody just gave like fucking so much money and I thought it was a guy talking to me that took over the computer.
[125:58.02]Mad because bad.
[126:01.55]Okay, hold on a second.
[126:04.00]Lamb Lamb just gave $250.
[126:06.46]$250 from Lamb Lamb.
[126:14.62]No message, just a quarter of a thousand dollars.
[126:18.00]A quarter of a million thousand dollars.
[126:20.01]And just says heart.
[126:21.87]Thank you so much, dude.
[126:23.57]Thank you for the fucking $250.
[126:24.23]That's a paycheck.
[126:24.71]Holy shit.
[126:32.70]Wowie!
[126:33.88]Alright, so I think we're okay now.
[126:36.92]Thanks a lot, dude.
[126:37.58]You ever seen anybody do that before when they get really upset or nervous?
[126:46.84]I do it sometimes.
[126:47.72]God, I look like shit.
[126:49.36]I really do.
[126:51.48]Time to consider some lifestyle choices.
[126:53.92]At least I'm not fat yet.
[126:57.08]I still look good here.
[127:00.99]Alright, let's try this again.
[127:07.65]Get a wig.
[127:13.41]Okay, so are we okay?
[127:18.01]I'm gonna have to do, I'm gonna do like a factory reset on this computer this weekend.
[127:21.27]Alright, how we doing?
[127:26.87]That's not right.
[127:28.19]That is absolutely incorrect.
[127:30.83]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[127:34.60]What the fuck is going on here?
[127:39.18]We were just listening to video game music and having a good time.
[127:42.84]And then my computer gets a virus on stream.
[127:45.84]But it doesn't have a virus.
[127:50.52]It's like the keyboard when I dump the fucking juice on the keyboard.
[127:59.39]Why is it mirrored?
[128:01.06]I didn't do that.
[128:04.40]Why did I do that?
[128:06.44]You see what I'm talking about?
[128:09.36]You guys seriously.
[128:11.43]You think I make this shit up.
[128:12.93]You do.
[128:14.19]I don't.
[128:15.15]I didn't do that.
[128:16.81]That just happened.
[128:17.57]A ghost took over.
[128:18.53]I have a fucking.
[128:19.61]My house is haunted.
[128:20.23]I have a haunted fucking house.
[128:22.41]Alright.
[128:34.35]It's because you did.
[128:35.19]Okay.
[128:40.13]More video games.
[128:40.82]Okay, I got a couple achievements.
[128:41.88]Back to what we were doing.
[128:47.90]Okay, I don't know what this is.
[128:59.17]How's that go?
[128:59.87]Not right.
[129:30.77]Kingdom Hearts.
[129:32.21]That's... Uh, by... Uh, Hitada.
[129:36.61]What's her name?
[129:38.41]When you walk the... No, that's... That's the... You know what song I'm talking about.
[129:46.41]Super Mario Brothers.
[129:58.80]I know this one.
[130:01.11]This is a classic shooter on the SNES.
[130:04.47]Smash TV.
[130:05.35]I'm surprised they've never made a... I should play this game on stream.
[130:09.86]Smash TV is fucking awesome.
[130:11.34]It's one of my favorite Super Nintendo video games.
[130:14.30]And I don't know why I do this sometimes, but I do.
[130:15.76]Like, I'm coming at you, I'm grabbing you, and I'm pulling you back.
[130:17.70]Let's go.
[130:19.86]Don't jam and roll.
[130:25.61]That's a good one, too.
[130:29.12]They got more than four in a row, five in a row.
[130:36.94]Seinfeld, yep.
[130:40.07]That's a good Seinfeld cover.
[130:43.71]Home Improvement.
[130:57.39]Mario RPG.
[131:02.19]Do a Super Nintendo thing too?
[131:03.35]I really should.
[131:04.29]Those games are so good.
[131:05.63]They're so much fun.
[131:06.43]Super Punch Out?
[131:14.83]Yeah, that's Super Punch Out.
[131:19.25]Wait, what?
[131:20.49]That's not Super Punch Out?
[131:32.14]That's definitely a punch-out.
[131:33.40]Has to be.
[131:35.06]It's the same sound.
[131:40.67]Why is that not working?
[131:44.97]Oh, okay.
[131:46.49]The giant clown, he was one of the hardest enemies in the game.
[132:05.08]It's holding this strong.
[132:06.14]It's pissing me off.
[132:07.76]What the hell?
[132:08.40]Aliens?
[132:35.82]Contra?
[132:36.34]Contra 2?
[132:41.54]What game is that?
[132:45.73]What game is this?
[132:50.59]No, there's a hole in the straw.
[132:52.61]Not the two holes.
[132:53.85]When you bend it too much, it breaks.
[132:55.19]Terminator?
[132:58.48]There's no giant alien in there.
[133:04.38]Is that Gunstar Heroes?
[133:09.13]It's not Gunstar Heroes?
[133:11.55]What is this?
[133:13.55]Fuck!
[133:13.99]I'm wasting my points!
[133:21.54]I don't know.
[133:21.90]Pinball?
[133:23.68]Pinball?! !
[133:33.29]What the hell is that?
[133:35.87]It's like a gummy Poco stick.
[133:40.10]Why do I have to lean in?
[133:40.94]I'm like... Like, I have to lean in when I get close to my monitor?
[133:43.64]What, am I fucking 80?
[133:47.12]That's a sad Kool-Aid man.
[133:50.98]That's a sad Kool-Aid... That's a Kool-Aid man in a life-the-game piece.
[133:55.75]Had a child, and there it is.
[133:59.13]That's not Ristar.
[134:00.01]Ristar is a star.
[134:01.03]That's clearly...
[134:02.96]A fucking sad jet ski.
[134:08.34]Draft support.
[134:32.50]I don't learn it right.
[134:35.90]The game that game is called... Am I spelling it wrong?
[134:54.98]Jurassic.
[134:57.12]Jurassic.
[135:00.17]I'm not doing it on purpose.
[135:02.27]Your ass is thick.
[135:10.00]Your ass... Your ass is thick.
[135:17.28]Fuck.
[135:23.95]Oh, you guys are fucking out of your minds.
[135:29.79]Uh, sometimes I gotta disappear.
[135:32.33]Your ass thick.
[135:41.05]That was not... That was a funny joke.
[135:42.88]I'm sorry.
[135:43.44]It was.
[135:44.68]I'm gonna give you credit there.
[135:45.62]Because that was fucking funny.
[135:50.66]Ay-yi-yi.
[135:52.32]It's two S's.
[136:02.88]Alright, Composure, get it together before the camera turns back on.
[136:06.20]Thanks for the money.
[136:17.65]Who was that?
[136:21.23]But Malwarebytes is still running in the background.
[136:23.93]Get out of here.
[136:24.61]You're making my computer speed go down.
[136:29.60]That was $50 from Eefs.
[136:31.30]Thank you, Eefs, for the $50.
[136:33.59]$60, actually.
[136:34.47]$60 from each.
[136:34.91]That's a lot of money.
[136:36.85]You missed Kirby, Jerma.
[136:38.11]Also, his 60 spot.
[136:39.29]Love you, and can I give you a hug at PAX?
[136:41.69]Yes.
[136:43.39]You absolutely can give me a hug at PAX.
[136:46.47]Just don't have any, like, fucking weird jokey electro, like, buzzers in your hands to, like, prank me.
[136:51.45]You know, don't do, like, the, oh, here you go, like, don't do it.
[136:53.55]That's not funny.
[136:54.11]It's not nice.
[136:55.27]It just, like, throws people off.
[136:58.41]Doesn't hurt.
[136:58.99]It's just you're not expecting it.
[136:59.81]You know, don't bring that to a meeting.

[153:08.83]It's a different name in the EU.
[153:21.74]That sounds awful.
[153:23.71]Or just if you know anybody in the circus, and they're kind of a dick, just start calling that.
[153:30.57]Be like, oh, you're a real acrobrat, dude.
[153:32.41]And he'll be pissed off that you stunned him with such superior linguistic skills.

[154:22.14]As part of publicity drive, Blockbuster didn't charge for rentals of the game.
[154:28.22]The ultra-distracting backgrounds of the game were actually a feature.
[154:31.09]It used a technique called Opti-Challenge, though to this day no other game has ever used it.
[154:37.55]The game makes an appearance in the South Park episode, Towelie.

[182:12.43]I know what this is, but I can't say it.
[182:15.21]It's not there.
[182:21.91]So what was wrong with this last time?
[182:24.17]There's a space.
[182:24.71]Okay, I gotta get another one right off the bat.

[183:50.93]I don't know.
[184:06.81]Shit.
[184:11.45]Fuck.
[184:22.34]Modern Warfare 2?
[184:22.92]No, it wasn't.
[184:25.58]That was not Modern Warfare 2.
[184:26.88]What?
[184:33.37]Why is Minesweeper on here, of all things?
[184:38.59]Alright, but we climbed back out of that hole.
[184:40.21]Double dragon.
[184:57.29]Slow down!
[185:06.56]Eh, fucking Angry Birds.

[185:29.86]Oh, this is, uh... Guy Fieri saves the world!
[185:32.14]No, um...
[185:34.31]What's the star, the guy with the fucking guitar?
[185:37.49]Skip it!
[185:37.86]I don't know what his name was.
[185:40.30]Scott, uh, Scott Pilgrim.
[185:45.22]I don't know.

[186:10.28]Okay, check rhyme radio probably would have been correct as well.
[186:17.67]Advanced Wars.
[186:21.29]No, what is it called?
[186:22.18]Advanced Wars.
[186:22.88]No, what is it?
[186:23.50]What is it?
[186:23.86]What is it?
[186:24.22]It's called Advanced Wars.
[186:28.08]Thank you.
[186:28.62]Not Advanced Wars.
[186:29.56]Advanced Wars.
[186:43.47]Don't know.
[186:50.30]Everybody puts the Lost Vikings in some game that everyone needs to know existed.
[186:58.28]Don't have any idea.
[187:04.06]Mario Party?
[187:08.67]Skip it.
[187:08.89]I don't have time for this.
[187:09.57]Gotta get this one right right now.
[187:13.56]That was Far Cry.
[187:14.66]I did it.
[187:15.10]We're done.
[187:15.76]We can move on.
[187:16.32]I'm done.
[187:23.08]That wasn't... Oh, that was a new Super Mario Brothers?
[187:26.50]Alright, let me... Let me pee.
[187:29.69]We're going to come back.
[187:30.31]We're going to do my alignment test.
[187:32.27]And then we'll see where we are from there.
[187:33.83]Let me just piss.
[187:35.01]Second pee of the night.
[187:36.19]See you in a second.
[188:30.71]Wait, what?
[190:09.99]Okay.
[190:11.19]Let's do my alignment test and then... So again, let me explain something.
[190:15.87]There's a lot of people here right now.
[190:19.38]Thanks for sticking around.
[190:21.18]The reason why we're doing this tonight, if you weren't here earlier, I had like 10 blue screens in a row over the course of a few hours.
[190:29.27]So I couldn't really get anything ready.
[190:31.81]And next week is Monster Rancher 2 on Tuesday.
[190:34.97]So that's why we're doing this right now.
[190:39.50]Rotate my tires.
[190:40.32]That's actually pretty good advice.
[190:44.88]But that's why we're doing this.
[190:46.18]We're going to wrap it up here in a little bit.
[190:47.42]I'm going to do my alignment test.
[190:50.28]I already know what I am.
[190:53.22]We'll just... I don't have a 780.
[190:55.52]I have a 1080.
[190:56.24]I don't have a TI, but I have a 780.
[191:00.68]Damn, is it good.
[191:02.76]Alright.
[191:03.79]Here we go.
[191:07.93]Let's move back over here.
[191:11.45]Hi there.
[191:13.76]Make this a little bigger.
[191:15.76]So, this is what is your character alignment?
[191:19.74]Let's make this a little bit better looking.
[191:26.32]Are you heroic lawful good or a chaotic evil?
[191:28.97]Find out.
[191:29.49]Let's play it.
[191:34.82]We make these tests, or I don't make them, but companies do and people do, to do in-depth reviews of who you are as a person.
[191:43.41]Are you lawful?
[191:44.33]Are you neutral?
[191:45.91]Are you chaotic?
[191:46.93]Are you good?
[191:47.49]Are you evil?
[191:48.33]It's a very in-depth test.
[191:50.24]So let's start with the first question here.
[191:52.92]Pick a song to listen to.
[191:54.12]Okay.
[191:59.12]Okay.
[192:02.23]I don't, me against the world, oh, I listen to Beethoven while killing people.
[192:11.99]Okay.
[192:13.64]Everyday Hero, Smash Mouth.
[192:17.36]Monster, Warriors, Monster.
[192:20.64]The Confrontation, I've never heard any of these songs.
[192:22.36]We're going to have to figure this out.
[192:26.07]I'm going to have to, I lost chat.
[192:27.83]Hold on a second.
[192:31.07]Apparently chat broke.
[192:34.39]Hold on.
[192:38.07]You still here?
[192:40.21]Is chat still here?
[192:41.17]Am I still here?
[192:41.83]Maybe not.
[192:53.38]Let's find out.
[192:56.30]Now it says I'm still alive.
[192:59.91]There we go.
[193:00.47]Now I can see you.
[193:04.31]Okay.
[193:06.09]So let's figure out which one of these songs we're going to pick.
[193:17.38]Yeah, my Twitch chat died.
[193:18.36]That was weird.
[193:19.08]Now I can see it again.
[193:22.84]Alright, so this was the first one.
[193:23.80]It was Me Against the World, Simple Plan.
[193:25.26]Let's see if I enjoyed this song.
[193:28.53]Again, these are first listens.
[193:30.11]I've never listened to any of these.
[193:36.48]OK.
[193:38.30]Let's see.
[193:57.31]Not gonna be just the victims.
[194:00.77]We're taking our dreams and they tear them apart.
[194:04.32]Till everyone's the same.
[194:07.48]Gotta go.
[194:08.12]No place to go.
[194:09.10]I've got nowhere to run.
[194:10.04]I'm reading.
[194:10.68]I don't know.
[194:11.58]The song sucks.
[194:12.34]I'm done with it.
[194:13.99]I don't know the name.
[194:15.25]The lyrics are on the screen.
[194:17.03]I'm glad you got the joke.
[194:26.81]Alright, now that I've listened to Beethoven, what about Everyday Superhero?
[194:34.30]By Smash Mouth.
[194:36.36]Let's see.
[194:48.78]Okay.
[195:00.94]I like that one.
[195:02.33]So far, that's the best one.
[195:04.65]How about Monster by Imagine Dragons?
[195:06.55]Why is Imagine Dragons on here twice?
[195:08.45]Who are the imaginary dragons?
[195:13.89]Okay, here we go.
[195:19.30]This is Monster by Imagine Dragons.
[195:39.40]How would this determine your character alignment?
[195:43.09]Okay, I'm gonna say... I'm gonna say no to that one.
[195:46.35]So far, it's Everyday Superhero by Smash Mouth.
[195:51.13]Warriors by Imagine Dragons.
[195:58.20]Wait, why is... League of Legends 2014 Tournament.
[196:01.48]Is this a League of Legends character...
[196:08.71]This is from the League of Legends World Tournament.
[196:17.78]It's like a CG cutscene.
[196:27.83]I don't play League, sorry.
[196:31.39]Alright, how about the confrontation?
[196:38.38]And that's Les Mis.
[196:39.16]OK, let's see how this is.
[196:49.02]Valjean, at last, we see each other plain Monsieur Le Maire, you'll wear a different chain Before you say another word, Le Maire Before you chain me up like a slave again Listen to me, there is something I must do Yeah, okay, I like that one.
[197:14.03]Between this and Smash Mouth, that's a good one.
[197:18.49]What about Monster?
[197:22.29]By Skillet.
[197:32.04]One ear.
[197:32.92]That's good.
[197:37.63]Nope.
[197:38.89]No.
[197:39.79]No.
[197:40.61]How about Let's Start a Riot?
[197:46.07]By Three Days Grace.
[197:57.34]No.
[197:58.04]So it's going to be the confrontation by Les Mis.
[198:00.18]Okay, good.
[198:04.60]Pick a quote.
[198:08.77]I am the thing that keeps you up at night.
[198:11.35]The evil that haunts every dark corner of your mind.
[198:13.53]I will never rest and neither will you.
[198:16.73]Forgive me, but to me you've been dead for centuries.
[198:18.95]It doesn't even say who said these.
[198:21.73]You broke the protocol of temporal displacement.
[198:24.09]You cheated.
[198:25.68]Illegal is always faster.
[198:28.64]There are all types of prisons, kid, and I'm making sure your prison is the town where you live.
[198:34.23]Ah, the Eiffel Tower and the ever-romantic City of Lights.
[198:38.55]We're definitely coming back here, baby, you know, when we don't have a world to save.
[198:44.92]It is simple.
[198:45.52]There is good and there is evil.
[198:46.82]There are those who commit crimes and those who stop them.
[198:49.08]Is this Captain America who said this?
[198:52.04]I'm a thief, kid.
[198:52.98]I'm not threatening your city.
[198:54.24]Just look it up from number one.
[199:05.00]I don't know.
[199:05.41]Where are these from?
[199:11.11]How about Ozzy Eiffel Tower?
[199:13.03]We're going to get like French as our alignment.
[199:16.45]We're going to be like French neutral.
[199:19.54]Which Hogwarts house would you like to be in?
[199:22.16]Slytherin.
[199:22.56]That's an easy question.
[199:23.68]Slytherin.
[199:25.46]Are you strongly suspect someone close to you is keeping secrets from you?
[199:28.59]What do you do?
[199:31.77]Um...
[199:33.70]Respect their privacy unless it becomes absolutely important that I know what's going on.
[199:38.50]Let them have their secrets as long as they're not doing anything illegal or wrong.
[199:42.27]Search their phone for info.
[199:43.49]Maybe see if they have a diary.
[199:44.77]Ransack their room if you have to.
[199:46.45]Nag them about it.
[199:47.35]Interrogate them at gunpoint.
[199:50.21]Ask them.
[199:50.77]Inform a higher authority to watch them get in trouble.
[199:53.78]Use their secrets to blackmail them.
[200:01.72]Um...
[200:03.73]Let's go.
[200:04.03]Let's look through their phone.
[200:06.25]Could be something bad.
[200:07.01]Pick a Marvel character.
[200:08.15]I'm not putting labels because I assume you'll recognize who they are.
[200:12.81]Do I know who they are?
[200:13.71]Okay, that's Logan.
[200:16.95]That's Dr. Manhattan.
[200:25.14]That's Loki.
[200:26.82]Hellboy.
[200:28.26]Green Goblin.
[200:30.70]Superman, Spider-Man, and Captain America.
[200:35.37]Let's go with... Okay, I'm like mischievous, right?
[200:43.41]I'm mischievous.
[200:43.99]I would do that.
[200:44.79]You're at a party and people are drinking.
[200:46.42]You're not of age and neither are most of the people at the party.
[200:52.78]But someone offers you a beer.
[200:54.40]What do you do?
[201:01.07]I think I picked the wrong one.
[201:02.49]There's, like, another one that is much more actually in-depth than this one.
[201:10.17]You were the one offering the beer.
[201:13.11]Wow.
[201:14.03]No.
[201:15.17]No, no, no.
[201:16.17]No.
[201:17.55]Don't drink, but take the opportunity to videotape drunk people at the party doing dumb things.
[201:21.36]This would be good ammunition.
[201:29.44]No.
[201:29.94]I'm the driver.
[201:30.96]No.
[201:33.62]Pick a DC Comics character.
[201:35.34]Alright.
[201:37.98]Do I know all these people?
[201:39.26]Let's see.
[201:40.95]I might not.
[201:42.09]The Joker.
[201:43.79]Batman.
[201:55.03]I don't know.
[201:55.79]Who is that?
[201:58.53]This is the Flash.
[201:59.35]Who's this guy?
[202:06.26]Guy with his phone out.
[202:08.54]We've got Superman.
[202:10.52]We've got Green Lex Luthor.
[202:12.08]And we've got Lex Luthor.
[202:14.52]And then... Slade.
[202:19.96]I'm going to go guy on his phone.
[202:20.86]That's probably what I would be doing.
[202:22.98]It's all fun and games until you hurt my friends.
[202:25.22]It's always fun and games.
[202:26.32]You break the law.
[202:27.91]People get hurt, then it's just a game.
[202:31.81]Wait.
[202:32.15]It's all fun and games until people get hurt, then it's just a game.
[202:36.71]Someone gets hurt, then it's just fun.
[202:39.13]You make me mad.
[202:40.15]You disobey me.
[202:40.94]You do the wrong thing.
[202:44.50]It's all fun and games until... This is the same answer, I think.
[202:53.32]It's all fun and games until you make me mad.
[202:57.08]Have you ever participated in a prank war?
[203:01.74]This is like... As long as no one got... Of course not, it's against the rules.
[203:09.41]If someone else had a prank war... I should have gone to like the Wizards of the West Coast.
[203:16.33]I went to like Play Buzz, BuzzFeed's quiz section.
[203:32.07]As long as no one gets hurt, sure.
[203:34.01]What's your motto?
[203:34.89]Do what's right, especially if it goes against the rules.
[203:37.73]Screw the rules.
[203:38.41]The difference between bombs and confetti is that bombs are more fun to throw around.
[203:42.43]Cheat the system.
[203:43.17]Look out for yourself.
[203:44.03]Everyone else is optional.
[203:45.62]Uphold the law.
[203:46.54]Do what you think is right.
[203:47.88]Do what's right.
[203:48.72]Do what you think is right.
[203:50.96]Almost done.
[203:51.74]Pick a job.
[203:52.26]Doctor, mercenary, judge, advisor, private agent, serial killer.
[203:56.16]That's not a job.
[203:56.89]That is a lifestyle.
[203:58.43]That is a way that you act.
[203:59.79]That's not a career.
[204:02.88]Let's go with the consultant.
[204:04.96]Pick a legend.
[204:12.14]Robin Hood.
[204:13.32]The Three Musketeers.
[204:15.24]Merlin.
[204:16.29]The Big Bad Wolf.
[204:18.33]Kronos.
[204:19.63]King Arthur.
[204:20.31]I got Looney Tunes character.
[204:24.79]And then the Sheriff of Nottingham.
[204:28.45]The Three-ish Musketeers.
[204:30.86]What?
[204:38.47]Kronos.
[204:40.91]Here we go.
[204:41.29]Here we go.
[204:43.01]Chaotic neutral.
[204:57.99]I don't try.
[204:58.45]No, this is, this was, we listened to like somebody's iPod.
[205:03.80]This is not how you do an alignment test.
[205:09.10]We already did my element.
[205:11.88]What is this?
[205:12.26]Oh, this is code breaker.
[205:13.88]Boxes.
[205:14.30]What are these?
[205:14.76]Math games?
[205:18.12]Hangman.
[205:20.88]Now do the Han Solo dance.
[205:22.66]No.
[205:24.47]No, that's it.
[205:28.99]How long is like the actual... No.
[205:33.55]Chaotic neutral?
[205:34.37]I don't know if I'm chaotic.
[205:35.69]I would say I'm like neutral...
[205:38.99]I would probably say neutral good.
[205:44.44]Play the Winnie the Pooh baseball game?
[205:47.62]That was awful.
[205:48.40]I just searched alignment test.
[205:50.62]Come on.
[205:50.96]I had like 20 minutes before the stream started.
[205:53.14]I searched D&D alignment test.
[205:55.40]I got like three or four first pages and I went down the page and I picked one.
[206:08.89]Chaotic stupid.
[206:10.04]New test.
[206:12.02]Play the Winnie the Pooh baseball game.
[206:13.42]I don't know.
[206:13.70]Where is it?
[206:14.14]Where's Winnie the Pooh baseball?
[206:16.12]Winnie the Pooh baseball.
[206:17.68]Huh?
[206:19.38]Oh.
[206:21.82]Play the Winnie the Pooh baseball game.
[206:26.30]This is gonna scream in my face.
[206:31.15]I swear to God.
[206:34.05]This is gonna be a screamer.
[206:37.59]Is it Winnie the Pooh Home Run Derby?
[206:48.91]The more Flash games I play, the more I'm going to risk losing my license.
[206:51.99]No, it's called... It's called My Computer Shit the Bed, and I can't do anything on it.
[206:57.90]So we have to play all these dumb fucking shitty Flash games and do quizzes.
[207:03.98]Because I blue screened ten times in two hours.
[207:09.14]Play the Japanese version?
[207:10.42]What?
[207:10.62]Alright, I'm just going to do this.
[207:12.42]Let's just see what happens.
[207:18.39]I'm going to move this.
[207:25.25]OK, this is Disney LOL.
[207:29.99]Interesting, they have like an LOL.
[207:30.95]Alright.
[207:39.55]People ran this?
[207:43.76]That the game's done quick?
[207:44.78]Are you serious?
[207:47.92]Alright, let's try it.
[207:49.28]How to play.
[207:51.70]Move Pooh with the mouse, keep your eye on the ball, take aim, click to swing.
[207:57.61]I pressed the back button.
[208:03.49]This is not- I don't like this ad.
[208:05.41]What is this ad?
[208:11.06]That was fucking weird.
[208:11.90]That was a weird start.
[208:30.33]Okay.
[208:32.11]Here we go.
[208:34.96]Try to hit the ball in the middle of that to make it fly.
[208:36.96]Yeah, move through the levels.
[208:37.96]Make a bunch of home runs.
[208:39.46]Let's go.
[208:41.39]Check your status.
[208:42.31]Increase your power.
[208:43.67]Make contact is power.
[208:44.91]Ball will hit farther.
[208:45.69]Makes it easy to hit the ball.
[208:46.61]And makes it so you can quickly swing.
[208:49.11]Is it like this deep of a level?
[208:51.50]Is it this deep of stuff here?
[208:52.78]Target 3.
[208:55.40]Balls.
[208:55.68]Let me go.
[208:59.36]Alright.
[209:05.21]This is fun.
[209:09.48]You will know fear.
[209:10.56]Why will I know fear?
[209:11.92]I don't understand.
[209:18.81]This is just a baseball game.
[209:27.77]Why did you want me to play this?
[209:35.54]Winnie the Pooh Home Run Derby?
[209:38.34]You hit home runs.
[209:39.16]That was a big one.
[209:52.51]I'm playing the baby easy mode?
[209:54.31]What are you- this is just on LOL.Disney.com!
[209:57.61]So this is one of those meme games.
[210:13.70]Choose a level.
[210:14.32]Stage 2.
[210:17.04]Lumpy.
[210:18.18]Ball's 15.
[210:18.82]Target, I gotta get 5.
[210:24.21]It gets hard.
[210:28.59]I'm gonna, like, lose before I can even start.
[210:34.19]Just keep playing.
[210:34.85]Okay.
[210:38.42]I'll keep playing.
[210:51.58]English isn't easier.
[210:52.72]I gotta upgrade the bat.
[210:58.68]Yeah, my bat like sucks right now.
[210:59.94]Foul ball.
[211:04.37]This is just a clickbait ad game on an iPad.
[211:07.11]That's what it seems like.
[211:08.85]That's what I would say.
[211:25.41]Am I actually getting baited right now, or is this some other thing that happens in this game?
[211:28.74]You guys gonna make me play this game all night?
[211:32.50]Oh, I got only a few chances left here.
[211:38.81]No, it is five.
[211:56.72]Home runs 5, level cleared.
[211:58.00]I don't understand, like... Let's go status.
[212:06.55]Boost power.
[212:07.33]Need 500 points.
[212:09.71]I wonder how many points we have.
[212:10.73]Okay, let's do power, power.
[212:14.27]Contact, speed, power.
[212:16.75]Contact, speed, speed.
[212:19.98]Speed.
[212:20.30]Let's go piglet.
[212:30.96]Oh, Jesus.
[212:31.60]My character... Did I grow in size?
[212:33.37]I need eight home runs.
[212:43.84]What could possibly be in this game?
[212:45.06]It's on a licensed Disney website.
[213:02.63]Try Undertale.
[213:03.31]I already... I beat Undertale twice.
[213:04.49]It's a great game.
[213:09.53]Upgrades offer casuals.
[213:18.30]I'm lost.
[213:26.58]Level 5 is actually impossible.
[213:28.82]We'll see.
[213:32.90]Get over there, come on.
[213:38.56]Get over the fence!
[213:40.22]Ah, come on!
[213:40.94]Bullshit.
[213:50.80]There it is.
[213:51.12]Okay, two more.
[213:55.87]Oh my god, my stream is dying.
[213:57.05]Does this game use extra internet?
[214:07.88]Got the target.
[214:16.78]It's mining Bitcoin in the back.
[214:18.46]Yeah, Disney's mining Bitcoin in the background.
[214:26.15]Alright, got 10 home runs.
[214:35.59]Upgrade.
[214:41.55]Alright, whatever.
[214:47.05]Got 10, needed 8.
[214:49.45]Level cleared, let's level up.
[214:50.83]6900 points.
[215:03.78]Sounds good to me.
[215:06.36]Stage 4.
[215:06.76]I need to hit 12, I have 25 tries.
[215:13.15]Oh, it gets a little weird.
[215:14.05]It gets a little weird.
[215:15.17]It's fine.
[215:15.57]Okay.
[215:22.12]It just fucking froze the game.
[215:30.67]No big deal.
[215:31.29]I mean, you can throw all kinds of shit at me if you want.
[215:39.65]I'll still take care of it.
[215:53.29]Losing to the kangaroo.
[216:04.69]No upgrades allowed on the Japanese version?
[216:06.71]Is that... are you serious?
[216:16.58]Why is Max Payne streaming on your account?
[216:20.76]I don't know.
[216:21.10]That's a great question.
[216:21.94]I should probably ask him.
[216:31.49]Yeah, what are we doing here?
[216:32.65]What are we watching here?
[216:35.53]I had that question before as well.
[216:42.07]You can upgrade the Japanese version, people just don't look through the menus.
[216:53.28]Two more shitty quizzes.
[216:55.74]Well, now I'm invested.
[217:03.24]Okay, I'm seriously not even kidding.
[217:04.58]An ad just loaded and I felt it.
[217:07.08]I could feel it in my hand.
[217:23.77]The thing that makes it a meme is it's a child's game.
[217:28.47]Oh.
[217:30.91]I guess that makes sense.
[217:31.81]I might not do it.
[217:38.87]Nah, I got it.
[217:42.98]Yeah, you're watching me hit some dingers.
[217:48.18]I'm not choking.
[217:48.76]I'm not choking.
[217:50.11]Everything's fine.
[217:52.63]That was fast.
[217:53.29]I wasn't prepared for that one.
[217:58.33]It's fine. 13.
[218:08.27]So far, I feel like here comes the hardness, right?
[218:13.14]Rabbit.
[218:16.00]Speed.
[218:16.82]Contact.
[218:19.82]Power.
[218:20.06]I probably should have done power.
[218:21.28]I probably should have done power.
[218:24.00]It's all good.
[218:26.56]Alright, here we go.
[218:27.41]Gotta hit 15.
[218:28.05]Okay.
[218:28.45]Bring it on.
[218:53.29]It's not that bad.
[218:54.43]That's not that bad.
[219:02.59]Just gotta hit 15 of them.
[219:11.71]George is getting upset.
[219:12.81]Brought him to the mound and hit him with the bat.
[219:23.62]Oh, I swung a little too early there.
[219:29.45]Wait, why did I cheat?
[219:30.33]I don't understand.
[219:34.41]What did I do that was cheating?
[219:35.79]Because I used the game mechanic to put points in?
[219:38.79]I'm gonna beat Pooh Home Run Challenge on stream.
[219:53.83]I wasn't supposed to get upgrades.
[219:59.07]Why not?
[220:07.44]Is this the guy that beat Pooh's Home Run Challenge in one sitting first try blind on Disney.LOL.com LOL.Disney.com Alright, stop fucking around.
[220:19.75]You have to hit like five more.
[220:29.82]Alright, I'm gonna lose.
[220:32.34]I'm choking right now.
[220:33.34]Can't choke this out.
[220:36.98]Choking!
[220:38.28]He's choking!
[220:39.30]We're fine.
[220:51.55]Choking!
[221:01.50]Five more.
[221:06.62]Get over the fence.
[221:07.57]GET OVER THE FUCKING FENCE!
[221:15.27]I gotta get- I can only miss one more.
[221:31.92]Two more.
[221:44.59]Choking!
[221:45.47]Choking!
[221:51.58]Get the fuck out of here with your hard game!
[222:06.39]Woo!
[222:11.75]I got 20,000 points, too.
[222:13.08]We're gonna spend it.
[222:13.72]Alright, Mr. Owl is coming up here.
[222:19.96]I need more power than that.
[222:22.46]Speed.
[222:23.04]Speed and power.
[222:24.12]Contact is alright, but we need power.
[222:31.71]Level 6.
[222:39.79]Well, that's different.
[222:44.83]Gotta get 19.
[223:07.10]Come on, fuck you.
[223:12.67]Get over that fence.
[223:13.38]I'll get it.
[223:25.11]That was bullshit.
[223:34.04]Wow, that really is like not fucking possible.
[223:42.07]I need more speed, because I need to go like this with him.
[223:56.69]Still possible.
[224:03.89]You do enough speed, you move back and forth with him, you'll do it.
[224:08.42]I need more speed.
[224:20.13]Get over the fucking fence.
[224:25.64]You've not even begun to suffer is what somebody just said.
[224:29.75]Damn.
