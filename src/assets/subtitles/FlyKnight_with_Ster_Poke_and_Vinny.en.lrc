[00:17.22]And then it's going to be so good.
[00:18.72]It's going to be a crazy one.
[00:22.68]This one's going to be crazy.
[00:23.88]I think Ster is here.
[00:38.70]I'm just going to call them.
[00:52.28]Uh, hello there.
[00:53.02]Hold on.
[00:56.67]I got to open up the game and people can't hear you.
[01:02.71]What?
[01:07.12]Hold on, nobody can even hear the funny thing you're saying.
[01:13.22]Okay, now they can hear you.
[01:25.38]What?
[01:27.56]Yeah, what are you talking about?
[01:50.85]You guys on Overwatch?
[01:53.13]Are you guys playing Overwatch again?
[01:56.60]Does it suck?
[01:59.98]It's alright.
[02:00.34]It's good.
[02:07.19]Okay.
[02:07.39]Okay.
[02:15.77]uh people apparently could not hear you guys I don't know how but now they can that was really weird still no they can definitely hear you now they just think I'm being a weirdo alright so flying I okay well I get to redo my hello to them I guess yeah please do hey guys I don't really care that you're here anyway so is that better than the other one because the other one apparently sounded sarcastic I I mute him again
[02:47.68]I guess the joke doesn't work because I didn't hear the first one.
[02:50.02]Alright.
[02:54.28]So we're playing this.
[02:55.48]So this is like a Dark Souls type game.
[02:57.18]Yeah, like Hammer Knight.
[03:00.81]Are we doing Hammer Watch or are we doing Fly Knight?
[03:03.95]Fly Watch.
[03:04.55]Alright, Fly Knight.
[03:10.22]Okay, let me open it.
[03:11.40]I tried to do the tutorial, but I failed.
[03:13.14]You failed the tutorial?
[03:14.34]It was like an hour and 15 minutes by the time I was near the end, so I just panic refunded.
[03:19.38]Wait, I'm doing it right now.
[03:20.14]Does it take 15 minutes?
[03:22.62]An hour and 50.
[03:23.20]It was very hard.
[03:24.99]An hour?
[03:25.47]Yeah, so I refunded.
[03:27.77]No, he's full of shit.
[03:29.27]That's not the case.
[03:30.55]How's it going, Jerma?
[03:31.65]How are you today?
[03:32.67]I'm doing well.
[03:33.29]I'm ready to play Flyknife.
[03:35.51]What's your chili?
[03:37.15]What's my chili?
[03:37.91]Chili?
[03:38.59]Yeah, like when you make your special chili, me and Poke were talking about, Poke makes really good chili.
[03:43.67]Well, my mom made the chili right now.
[03:45.15]Yeah, but now it's your recipe because it's passed down through generations, right?
[03:49.25]Oh, yeah.
[03:50.57]I guess, right.
[03:52.61]I love big kidney beans.
[03:54.07]I love kidney beans.
[03:54.78]I love a little bit of spice.
[03:56.82]I love a little bit of Tabasco in it.
[04:00.82]I'm big on, I love a little bit of cheese melted on top, not a whole, not a shitload, just like enough to make it, you know, just melt into the top there.
[04:10.78]Uh, I like meat in there.
[04:12.36]I like a meaty chili.
[04:16.30]Is that like... Oh yeah, no, that's good.
[04:18.14]Some beef, for sure.
[04:20.19]How could you have chili without beef?
[04:22.83]You can do a meatless chili.
[04:24.35]That's disgusting.
[04:28.07]Alright, so who's hosting?
[04:29.19]How are we doing this?
[04:29.73]So is anybody ready to... What?
[04:33.46]That's a natural progression to play the game.
[04:35.60]No.
[04:38.23]nothing sorry that why is that so funny it's me it's me because I said that's gross and you just like like I don't know I rolled you're like okay fine alright let's play the game I'm just I'm just trying to get the ball moving alright enough of that well vinny isn't here where's vinny he's on route I'm just uh doing the tutorial yeah poke isn't done yet we still have time to
[05:07.48]dawdle this is dawdling time uh I'm assuming you guys made your bugs pretty cool looking right oh yeah I'm green so if anyone made green like uh I'm red I have red eyes uh we definitely should probably be different uh to differentiate right I think a name shows up oh really alright are you I think I'm gonna be spear guy I'm colorblind
[05:38.50]Are you guys?
[05:38.98]Are you actually?
[05:40.20]Yeah.
[05:41.32]Mild Dutton.
[05:42.49]What about you?
[05:44.65]I don't know.
[05:45.49]I've never really been tested for it, but I don't think so.
[05:47.71]I think I can see pretty much everything.
[05:50.25]It's just like those dot tests to see if you can do it or not.
[05:54.13]So do you have trouble with like red, green, blue?
[05:56.72]Which is the spectrum that you have trouble with?
[06:00.74]Green and red.
[06:01.42]It's called mild.
[06:03.26]It's just Dutton.
[06:03.62]Interesting.
[06:04.90]Interesting.
[06:07.06]Yeah, I was curious about how good my vision really is.
[06:15.81]Are you actually seeing everything intended?
[06:19.65]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[06:20.97]Have I been seeing the world just completely differently than everybody else?
[06:25.61]What color is your blue?
[06:27.07]They think I'm over-exaggerating when I make a big deal about it.
[06:30.15]I don't know.
[06:30.45]What's up, Vinny?
[06:32.42]Hey.
[06:35.54]You guys are live, yeah?
[06:36.93]Yep.
[06:37.15]Yeah.
[06:37.59]Okay.
[06:39.09]Hello.
[06:39.87]Give me three minutes.
[06:41.57]I'm going to start and then I'll hop in.
[06:44.61]Alright.
[06:45.27]Start.
[06:45.57]Okay.
[06:46.83]I'm going to start.
[06:55.22]So how is everybody's weekend?
[07:00.08]Great.
[07:02.82]It's Tuesday.
[07:05.08]That's fine.
[07:06.36]I don't remember what happened on the weekend.
[07:09.52]So, I think we... Send friend an invite is great out for me.
[07:18.63]Wonder why.
[07:19.11]Yeah, same.
[07:21.57]I didn't go into the cave because I didn't know if that was going to start a whole thing.
[07:24.95]I'm in the cave right now.
[07:30.22]Was there more tutorial and we didn't do it?
[07:32.14]Is there another tutorial?
[07:33.00]Is there a second part?
[07:35.45]I don't know.
[07:35.83]I was listening to you.
[07:36.75]You said it was just the first part.
[07:38.49]I think you have to open online play.
[07:41.35]Okay.
[07:41.69]And then I'll probably see like whoever's games are up.
[07:51.98]Yeah, I'm in the cave.
[07:52.70]You there?
[07:55.22]Did you open your game for online play?
[07:58.24]And did you say friends only?
[08:00.49]Yeah.
[08:01.65]World's available.
[08:02.39]Let's see.
[08:02.75]I'm looking.
[08:03.15]I'm searching.
[08:12.10]Oh, I had a shield the whole time.
[08:18.16]Oh, I see you.
[08:19.28]Oh, you do?
[08:22.04]Yeah.
[08:22.74]How did you do that?
[08:25.00]Hold on.
[08:26.94]Hold on.
[08:27.14]I have to open my game.
[08:35.76]Yeah, this game's graphics are kind of intentionally frame ready.
[08:39.90]You can change it too.
[08:40.64]I think you can make it not so frame ready.
[08:44.34]I don't know about frame ready, but there was like display changes.
[08:48.98]I think they look good, but I think they mess with the stream bitrate.
[08:51.90]Yeah, you can really add a bunch of just crust on it.
[08:57.03]I don't know.
[08:57.43]Should I do crusty?
[09:01.61]Stop breathing in the mic.
[09:02.61]Have I been breathing?
[09:04.91]I've been hearing your chair a lot.
[09:07.80]I've been standing the whole day.
[09:09.96]Have I been breathing?
[09:10.76]Oh my god, I died in a tutorial.
[09:14.34]No, this game's actually fucking hard, okay?
[09:16.98]I died twice in the tutorial.
[09:19.62]He humbles you.
[09:20.42]Oh no.
[09:23.47]That's why I'm going spear.
[09:24.43]I just want distance.
[09:25.23]I ain't messing around.
[09:28.83]Well, there were spells.
[09:29.59]You're not casting spells?
[09:31.18]I might cast spells.
[09:31.94]I mean, do you level up?
[09:33.06]I don't know if there's a... Is it like an RPG or is it just an action game?
[09:37.92]I don't know.
[09:38.50]20% crunch?
[09:43.87]It was 15%.
[09:44.15]You can do filters too, but yeah, it's probably... Ooh, yeah, I don't know about that.
[09:54.08]There's no leveling or upgrades of any kind, apparently.
[09:57.38]So you just do with what you got.
[10:01.09]Yeah, it seemed like just finding gear.
[10:12.79]Did you guys do the fishing in the tutorial?
[10:15.13]I feel like it's pretty useful.
[10:17.54]I did.
[10:17.86]I only caught one though.
[10:20.32]Does it carry over?
[10:21.04]It seems to.
[10:22.96]Did you get a big one or?
[10:29.12]I got a couple of big ones.
[10:33.36]177 centimeters.
[10:34.80]That's pretty good, right?
[10:38.83]I don't know.
[10:40.55]189 centimeters.
[10:46.37]Eat them like potions.
[10:54.51]Okay.
[10:54.69]I hope Vinny's okay.
[10:59.42]Well, to be fair, it is exactly 4 o'clock.
[11:03.66]You did call early.
[11:04.58]We were just early.
[11:05.36]That's like six and a half feet, so that's pretty big.
[11:16.37]Yeah, that is pretty big.
[11:18.97]Do any adventures lately?
[11:22.67]I just dug a hole for a while.
[11:26.91]That was fun.
[11:28.59]You were playing dig a hole?
[11:29.79]Yeah, it was fun.
[11:30.33]Really?
[11:31.09]I was going to say.
[11:32.65]I played it.
[11:35.05]Really?
[11:35.81]I didn't beat it yet, though, so no spoilers.
[11:38.37]It's Peter Molyneux down there.
[11:45.90]Wow, looks like you dug the hole.
[11:49.74]You get to be in my next hole.
[11:55.03]Oh, sorry.
[12:02.01]Wait, I got a spell.
[12:05.16]The spell's pretty good.
[12:05.96]It's like a big bomb.
[12:11.44]You do have a mana bar, it seems, too.
[12:12.93]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[12:15.99]You get a spell.
[12:17.95]You get a spell.
[12:18.35]I thought you were going to be a spell guy.
[12:21.05]You're always the wizard.
[12:22.03]You're always the wise guy.
[12:23.13]Well, sometimes you want to change it up a little.
[12:28.16]So we should all be like one thing, right?
[12:31.82]I think you could be everything, but
[12:35.99]Probably isn't a bad idea to do multiple different avenues of attack.
[12:39.95]I wasn't sure.
[12:40.39]It said that you're slower depending on how much weight you have.
[12:43.33]And I don't know if that was counting weapons that are on the other slots.
[12:46.39]It counts the weapon only if it is currently in your hands.
[12:51.05]Okay.
[12:51.81]So if you have the two-handed.
[12:52.57]So you can like switch the knife and start bee hopping.
[12:55.23]Yeah.
[12:55.87]So if you have a big two-hander on equipped and you're actually using it.
[13:00.23]Yeah.
[13:01.29]Big two-hander.
[13:06.80]You guys in game?
[13:08.76]I just got to the campfire.
[13:10.96]How much more is that after that?
[13:12.88]So if you go in the door after that, there's another campfire, and I think that's where online begins.
[13:20.95]Here we go.
[13:22.19]Oh, hi, guys.
[13:23.47]Hi, Jerma, Ster, and Poke.
[13:25.17]How are you today?
[13:27.37]Good.
[13:27.85]How are you today?
[13:30.41]I'm one minute late to our collaboration, and I'm sorry about that.
[13:35.90]That's fine.
[13:37.48]We talked about it, but it's fine.
[13:39.68]A minute?
[13:40.44]Okay.
[13:41.84]I don't like you guys talking about me when I'm not here.
[13:45.94]We did.
[13:46.68]I'm just not going to talk right now.
[13:48.93]I'm just not going to speak about it.
[13:50.79]You know what you did.
[13:52.21]And that's it.
[13:55.11]We can just move on.
[13:55.73]I love you guys.
[13:58.95]Why are we fighting?
[14:00.37]I don't feel that love anymore, Poke.
[14:01.81]I just don't.
[14:02.99]Dude.
[14:05.50]Alright, so invite.
[14:08.49]Alright, so Ster, did you figure this out yet?
[14:11.95]I'm opening the game right now.
[14:13.91]How come you don't have the game open?
[14:16.43]No.
[14:17.77]What have you been doing?
[14:19.17]I'm here now.
[14:20.88]I'm opening the game.
[14:21.82]We're getting it going.
[14:24.51]Hurry!
[14:26.19]Alright, alright, alright.
[14:28.13]Let me figure out how to do this.
[14:29.85]Um, open online.
[14:30.67]Remember when everybody had a HDD hard disk drive and everything took... Like, remember... Dude, okay, wait, wait.
[14:36.82]What's the longest it took the three of you to turn on your computer ten years ago?
[14:44.18]To get to boot to Windows.
[14:45.82]Like, you're actually on the desktop.
[14:47.54]Like, what's the longest that ever took as of ten to fifteen years ago?
[14:53.25]Three minutes.
[14:54.68]Yeah, a couple minutes.
[14:55.46]Yeah, that was like a leave the room situation.
[14:58.36]Yeah, leave the room for sure, actually.
[15:00.40]Bathroom time.
[15:02.44]Sometimes it was 10 minutes for me.
[15:04.34]And you could even hear it.
[15:07.18]But, Jerma, did you ever do the thing where you made the computer monitor go boing?
[15:11.85]No.
[15:14.09]What was that called?
[15:17.45]Degoss.
[15:18.23]When you degossed it.
[15:19.59]Oh, and it made that weird, like...
[15:24.84]the door thing?
[15:27.58]no no it was just you had to degauss your monitor because it would build up like magnetic like radiation I don't know yeah I'm not like a scientist I know what you mean yeah yeah yeah that was fun sometimes I would just hear my hard drive it would be 10 straight minutes and it'd be loading up all those bloated shit programs that I just I didn't even know what they were and you would hear it you could hear your hard drive going
[15:55.44]for like 15 straight minutes I don't know man the flying toaster screensaver seems pretty necessary to me dude how many times you ever control alt delete and see 100 cpu and not even give a I have I had 256 megabytes of ram crazy that was my ram before I remember trying to get into Half-Life 1 and play that but I couldn't because my computer wasn't good enough
[16:21.58]And I waited years to play Half-Life 1.
[16:24.22]Oh, that's heartbreaking.
[16:24.94]I had to ask my friends to turn off the flashlights in-game because I'd lose FPS.
[16:29.92]I would have to look down to get more FPS.
[16:31.78]Oh, that's awesome.
[16:34.21]That's GoldenEye speed strats.
[16:37.99]No, I upgraded my computers based on Half-Life 1 and then 2.
[16:42.13]So that was my first upgrade and then my second upgrade.
[16:46.32]So it was like six years, yeah.
[16:48.12]Yeah, I remember playing Command & Red Alert, and my computer was so slow, the game ran at like maybe 5 to 10 frames a second.
[16:57.20]I played like this for almost a decade.
[16:59.98]I went back to it years later, and the game felt like it was in x10 speed.
[17:05.26]I hated it.
[17:05.76]I couldn't play it.
[17:06.32]It was like, what the fuck is this?
[17:07.42]This is giving me anxiety.
[17:09.30]It's too fast.
[17:10.04]No time to make decisions.
[17:11.02]Yeah, it's way too fast.
[17:12.64]And it would be way slower.
[17:14.46]Can we play Red Alert 2 next time?
[17:16.12]Against each other?
[17:16.72]All of us?
[17:17.23]Oh, that would be amazing.
[17:18.71]What an amazing idea.
[17:19.41]Red Alert 2 might be tough.
[17:21.19]I know they remade the Red Alert and the original, but not 2 yet.
[17:25.05]What about Renegade?
[17:26.09]I loved Renegade.
[17:28.21]Command and Conquer Renegade.
[17:29.81]I would be all over an original Red Alert.
[17:32.83]Just, you know, free for all or 2v2.
[17:36.11]All of them.
[17:37.42]Two of us on Team Yuri, two of us on Team Yaoi.
[17:40.98]I'm so down for that.
[17:41.96]That'd be awesome.
[17:45.23]alright where are we going boys how do we join the conversation really changes oh man the next time we play way better than now but I guess we'll play fly at the fly night right now I guess that's so funny the conversation did change every time you spoke Ster it was four or five different conversations each time you said a sentence I get the last laugh
[18:08.41]If I'm weird, just let me know.
[18:10.99]Okay.
[18:12.75]Poke, I might join you.
[18:13.63]I might tap into a little bit of coconut water.
[18:16.39]Getting a little weird.
[18:18.49]I just spilled it all over me.
[18:19.45]I am opening the server.
[18:22.57]Okay.
[18:24.34]I'm figuring out... Oh, I got it.
[18:25.48]It's a three-man, though.
[18:27.64]It's only one of the three people.
[18:30.22]You can switch.
[18:31.04]When you do open online play to make a game, you can do four.
[18:35.58]There's only three slots.
[18:39.13]Oh, I thought I was... Start the server.
[18:42.12]Oh, there's friendly fire.
[18:45.18]That's not good.
[18:46.90]I can't get in still.
[18:48.86]Do I have to remake it?
[18:49.88]I think you do, man.
[18:51.48]I can't join.
[18:53.22]I can go off on my own if you guys want.
[18:54.80]I mean, I'm... Fucking idiot.
[18:59.60]Wow.
[19:00.21]Wow.
[19:00.65]Really mean.
[19:01.51]Really mean to me.
[19:04.11]Oh, great.
[19:07.95]okay let me know when to join now did you guys just join Ster from Steam uh from the campfire so you go to you do friends only and then you search uh worlds oh and it'll show up uh it should just kicked me off the server and it leaked everything okay I made a new one it just leaked your house stirs just put a picture of your it just showed me sitting in my chair like on my ceiling like a like a grayscale
[19:38.95]surveillance camera panning left and right in my room why would you wear that you switch scenes and you see Freddy Fazbear standing still where's the world okay next conversation I got it oh we're having fun already it's been a good time so far fellas okay unfortunately this was my allotted time for the evening I believe that enjoy your night
[20:10.11]Alright, we are all different colors.
[20:13.17]Okay, so good, good, good.
[20:15.61]Wait, you're all the same for me.
[20:18.09]We are?
[20:18.41]Wait, never mind.
[20:19.29]It's the armor.
[20:20.13]Poke, we're similar, but we're pretty, we're different.
[20:22.51]So that's good.
[20:24.79]I got blue eyes, lighter green.
[20:27.75]The eyes are different, yeah.
[20:30.19]Who wants to be sword?
[20:31.27]We need a tank, we need DPS, we need ranged, and we need a... I'll tank if you promise not to poke me in the back.
[20:38.63]Okay.
[20:39.55]I'll shield up front.
[20:42.05]Do you want to be Ranger?
[20:43.17]I can be... I have four arrows.
[20:49.27]Yeah, I have four arrows too.
[20:50.51]That's not going to be great.
[20:51.65]We'll have to just collect arrows.
[20:55.19]What the hell is making that sound?
[20:59.25]How did you do that?
[21:00.83]Z. Oh yeah, there's like emotes and stuff.
[21:04.04]Fly noises.
[21:04.70]I heard a weird sound.
[21:08.64]flies the yak like they vomit on their food before they eat it you know I don't I I'll never eat a pistachio pistachio again in my life really yep do you see about that fact where there could be worms in them or like larva eggs I mean I don't want that I do not see that fact there's like a percent chance to have a larva egg in it
[21:34.42]Also, make sure you're blocking and doing the parry and the kick and shit too.
[21:37.56]Just like they taught us.
[21:38.26]Extra protein.
[21:39.36]I remember, yeah.
[21:41.74]We eat, statistically, like 35 spiders a day.
[21:44.76]I think they said.
[21:46.61]So we're, you know, it's fine.
[21:48.01]You get used to it.
[21:48.63]35 a day?
[21:49.61]Yeah.
[21:51.91]I gotta get my numbers up.
[21:52.75]We're getting messed up.
[21:56.91]Alright, so it's grubs for the first area.
[21:59.78]I see a, there's a guy up ahead.
[22:01.22]There's a guy?
[22:02.18]Who's tanking?
[22:03.68]Oh, there's a guy.
[22:04.16]Alright, you have the tank?
[22:05.73]I'm gonna tank him.
[22:07.09]Wait, wait.
[22:07.41]Alright, go for it, Ster.
[22:10.80]Yeah, Ster, I believe in you.
[22:12.34]Maybe he's nice.
[22:14.66]Oh, shit.
[22:15.66]What was that?
[22:16.90]You kicked yourself off.
[22:17.88]You got him.
[22:19.66]Yeah, he bounced.
[22:20.38]I don't know.
[22:20.76]My kick bounced.
[22:22.66]Got him.
[22:23.66]Did he drop a crate?
[22:24.22]There's a dungeon over here.
[22:26.56]Did he?
[22:27.70]Anything in the crates?
[22:28.80]How are you hurt already?
[22:29.88]Because somebody hit me in the back when we were walking.
[22:33.02]Somebody shoved a fucking sword in my back.
[22:38.29]Yeah, friendly fire is on and it's very deadly.
[22:42.01]Okay.
[22:42.71]Deadly fire.
[22:43.43]Archer.
[22:44.42]Oh, shit.
[22:45.51]That's a good idea.
[22:46.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:46.99]Use the magic.
[22:47.55]Ah, man, I missed.
[22:49.07]I missed, too.
[22:54.03]Fly escape.
[22:54.49]Yeah, that's scary.
[22:55.93]Be careful.
[22:56.35]Get him.
[22:59.20]Get him.
[22:59.68]Poking his head off.
[23:00.64]Yeah.
[23:01.16]Did he drop anything?
[23:03.50]Um, three arrows.
[23:05.72]Yeah.
[23:05.98]Yeah.
[23:08.87]So do we have like dedicated roles or are we just kind of doing whatever's needed in the situation?
[23:13.35]What do you think?
[23:13.79]I guess for now we can do whatever.
[23:15.31]This chest in there.
[23:15.97]Until the first weapon or something drops.
[23:18.57]Yep.
[23:20.55]Why do I feel like this is too many of us in here?
[23:28.03]I feel like we're going to get each other killed.
[23:30.79]As long as we, if the spear is good for accuracy.
[23:34.33]So we could maybe use that.
[23:37.75]by the way they can still if okay if you lock their heads off with a spear they can still attack you yeah we should all just kick them make sure you have your potions poke or anything oh yeah you know what there's a ring in here that prevents friendly fire so who's getting hurt the most from friendly fire oh wow um they knew the game knew um I would give that to
[24:04.69]Who has the least amount of health right now?
[24:06.83]You, because you got backstabbed, I guess.
[24:08.33]We can trade it, right?
[24:11.90]Oh, that's cool.
[24:14.32]Everyone gets their own loot.
[24:15.62]Oh, really?
[24:17.88]Oh.
[24:18.06]No, you just picked up the arrows from that chest.
[24:21.48]I don't know if you get your own loot from enemies.
[24:23.38]Is anything in the chest for you guys?
[24:24.85]Oh, shit.
[24:25.17]Be right back.
[24:28.95]Because I just picked it up.
[24:31.76]I picked it up.
[24:32.72]So we all have it.
[24:33.60]Let me try attacking you.
[24:35.53]I'll be right back in like 20 minutes.
[24:38.03]20?
[24:41.32]Wait, is he BRBing in this hallway here?
[24:47.94]Oh no.
[24:48.48]I hope he got his friendly fire ring.
[24:50.08]I'm kidding.
[24:52.46]I'm kidding.
[24:53.50]I'm kidding.
[24:54.12]I'm kidding.
[24:55.76]I'm kidding.
[24:56.62]He was blocking first.
[24:58.40]Are we going to check out these fly traps?
[25:01.66]We could see what they do.
[25:02.98]I get it.
[25:03.86]You get it?
[25:04.94]No.
[25:05.20]What are you talking about, man?
[25:06.23]Where are flies?
[25:08.35]Get it?
[25:09.75]The theming is on point.
[25:10.81]I'll give him that.
[25:14.11]It was alright.
[25:14.61]I don't miss supplies.
[25:18.32]Oh, there's nothing down here.
[25:19.90]A leak.
[25:22.50]What is leak?
[25:23.24]We can't pick it up.
[25:24.02]Yeah, I can't pick it up either.
[25:27.38]I see how it is, sir.
[25:28.34]There's nothing down there, guys.
[25:29.40]No, I'm going to kill them.
[25:33.43]It's awesome.
[25:33.93]It's fun.
[25:36.43]Okay, so let's go this way.
[25:38.83]I knew he was going to get an item.
[25:41.37]It's a spell.
[25:42.23]Wait, it's a mace?
[25:43.93]Wait, what?
[25:45.63]You getting cool stuff down there?
[25:47.27]Yeah, kind of.
[25:49.15]Take a look at my weapon.
[25:51.52]All I see are leaks.
[25:55.42]Dude, I am so jacked up about this red alert idea.
[26:04.38]We had talked about this before, but I was going to bring up Red Alert again.
[26:08.73]Poor Ster though.
[26:10.33]We've been trying to do Hammer Watch for weeks.
[26:12.77]Ster, I'll do Hammer Watch with you.
[26:14.73]We can make this happen together.
[26:15.99]Okay.
[26:18.36]But I would love Red Alert.
[26:20.12]Wait, Ster, you like Hammer Watch?
[26:22.98]I was going to play it like three weeks ago.
[26:26.15]Oh, shit.
[26:26.75]Like myself.
[26:28.25]I think we have to go back.
[26:30.17]I think you deliberately were waiting to play it with a group, and it just hasn't happened, and it's been a month.
[26:37.31]I'll play with you.
[26:40.24]We just keep posting games in the server, and they take precedence over Hammerwatch 2 every time.
[26:45.16]Actually, I like that, that I keep bringing Hammerwatch to the table, and you show up with something cooler.
[26:48.92]Well, maybe cooler.
[26:51.10]We don't know.
[26:51.44]As long as we all show up.
[26:54.28]someone kick this person I think is it npc maybe they sell stuff wait you could talk who's reading terrible bloodbath just read this for me what a terrible bloodbath no here I was hoping the knights would put up a fight there go my hopes it's such a shame something stank about that ambush but I just don't have the time for that I'll keep going just the same
[27:22.72]What do we want to say?
[27:27.37]Who are you?
[27:27.89]Don't mind me.
[27:29.53]Just a vagrant taking back something that was stolen from me.
[27:33.63]Oh, and don't worry.
[27:34.35]I'm no friends with that treacherous witch.
[27:37.02]Don't get what's coming to her one way or another.
[27:40.66]Yeah, who's the witch?
[27:41.84]Join me in combat, perhaps.
[27:44.56]Hey, you're funny.
[27:45.24]Sorry, but I'm no fighter, and despite my size, I prefer discretion.
[27:49.10]You keep doing your thing, though.
[27:50.36]Good luck, child.
[27:51.80]Farewell.
[27:55.85]I tried to kill it.
[27:57.49]Alright.
[27:59.15]Fare thee well, vagrant fly.
[28:00.91]Hey, we gonna rest in here?
[28:02.49]Yeah, we should rest.

[28:05.27]Oh, let me kill it first.

[28:43.69]Watch out, I'm scared.
[28:45.05]Alright, alright, alright.

[29:36.75]Make sure you use your Estus.
[29:38.38]I know that's not what it's called, but it is.
[29:41.46]They literally, yeah, I mean, there's bonfires.
[29:43.42]Oh, God.
[29:43.68]Oh, wait, it starts that up.
[29:46.74]That was a mistake.

[30:40.91]Yeah, they all respawned.
[30:42.83]I'm coming back.
[30:44.53]Oh, shit.
[30:45.05]That's right.
[30:53.74]Careful, Rooney.
[30:56.49]Vinny, let me go.
[30:57.11]Let me go.
[30:57.63]He didn't attack for a minute.
[30:58.65]It was kind of weird.
[31:00.83]Parry, kick.
[31:03.97]Parry, kick.
[31:07.16]Parry, kick.
[31:09.46]Get him.
[31:14.34]He dropped his arm off.
[31:15.70]I'll accept all arrow donations.
[31:18.98]Uh, I got some.
[31:20.69]Oh, can I throw them down?
[31:22.21]I want it to be... I don't want any daggers.
[31:24.63]Oh, you want a dagger here?
[31:26.36]I dropped a bunch of arrows.
[31:28.48]How do you drop it?
[31:29.56]Here.
[31:30.38]No, it's fine.
[31:31.28]I dropped my dagger.
[31:32.88]It's fine.
[31:33.42]I don't want it.
[31:34.46]It's fine.
[31:35.24]No, it's not fine.
[31:36.21]I'll just take it.
[31:36.77]You picked it back up.
[31:38.57]Oh, okay.
[31:39.29]Here.
[31:40.15]Vinny, you're going to die, dude.
[31:41.03]Do you need potions?
[31:42.21]Do you not have them?
[31:43.13]No, I'm good.
[31:43.67]I'm just not drinking my potion enough.
[31:45.71]You get a good three or four uses out of it, so I should be using that more.
[31:49.82]There are a lot of grubs here.
[31:50.80]Thanks, man.
[31:57.45]I know what's on Jerma's mind right now.
[32:00.13]He's thinking about bugs and swords and spears.
[32:04.38]Would you play Starcraft or is that like not your thing?
[32:23.74]I'm not a big Starcraft fan.
[32:25.36]How about Warcraft 3?
[32:27.12]I love Warcraft 3, especially the custom games.
[32:30.36]Oh.
[32:31.62]Pokester, you guys ever play the Warcraft 3 stuff?
[32:34.23]Custom games?
[32:35.01]I grew up on that.
[32:36.05]Oh, man.
[32:36.51]That's another one.
[32:37.15]Tower defense.
[32:39.67]Yeah, the Darwin's Island.
[32:41.15]We talked about that one.
[32:41.97]We got to do that one.
[32:43.45]And Red Alert.
[32:44.61]We got to do this stuff.
[32:46.04]This is all good fuel.
[32:47.32]I think Red Alert would be so funny.
[32:53.15]Until you get destroyed in the first five minutes because I was a pro back in the day.
[32:58.47]I actually think I'm going to destroy all three of you.
[33:00.89]I call Teamster.
[33:01.89]Yeah, I do.
[33:03.53]I'm going to practice.
[33:07.64]If you know how to... It's not fair.
[33:09.68]I don't know anything.
[33:11.14]I'm going blind.
[33:11.94]No, no, no.
[33:12.78]This is my one chance to be good at a game that we're all playing.
[33:16.16]I'm going blind.
[33:16.76]I don't know anything.
[33:17.92]You have a chance.
[33:18.56]You have a chance every time.
[33:20.84]I won't practice.
[33:26.67]Alright, are we banning Tanya, or is Tanya going to be allowed?
[33:31.89]Who's Tanya?
[33:33.63]Hey, don't even worry about it.
[33:37.53]Great, still some wingless filth left.
[33:41.29]I assumed your kind would either be dead or halfway towards whatever foul hole you came from.
[33:45.75]Wait, I can't talk.
[33:47.41]I'm not going to read the rest, but I just want to get one good paragraph in.
[33:55.21]I don't think anybody else can talk to this character.
[33:58.46]Hold on, sorry, I was in there.
[34:02.38]It was a lot of fun, but I didn't want to read it out loud.
[34:04.48]Travel back to the first bonfire and get the ring.
[34:08.44]Should we do that or no?
[34:10.50]Yeah, I don't have one either.
[34:12.91]Let's go.
[34:14.57]Hey, what else have we got going on?
[34:16.89]Let's go get it, it's ours.
[34:18.53]Oh, it's instant.
[34:26.84]Wait, there was a different route, by the way.
[34:30.42]When we went out that castle thing, we went left and there was a way right.
[34:36.95]You know, for the longest time in Red Alert, I didn't know they were picking up gold.
[34:42.69]The little trucks.
[34:45.93]I just thought it was food or sand.
[34:50.40]Tiberius.
[34:51.44]Tiberium.
[34:52.24]In Red Alert, I think it's gold.
[34:53.88]It's like ore in quotes.
[34:55.14]I think it's gold.
[34:57.58]I think it's like the little crystals.
[34:59.36]That was the coolest part.
[35:00.37]It looks like little pieces of candy on the ground.
[35:08.21]I would also, I would say, for me, I grew up with Red Alert, not Red Alert.
[35:12.01]I grew up with the original Command & Conquer.
[35:13.91]And then when they remastered, I played Red Alert.
[35:16.97]And I was like, man, this is better.
[35:18.88]I wish I played this growing up.
[35:20.04]This was better.
[35:22.06]Why is the archer the strongest guy in the game?
[35:26.92]I never played the newer Command & Conquers.
[35:30.64]I remember being young and playing Renegade, though.
[35:32.89]Renegade was so cool.
[35:34.21]Renegade was cool.
[35:35.85]RTS.
[35:36.57]Red Alert 2 was alright.
[35:38.61]I think they did a little too much with Red Alert 2.
[35:41.49]It was a little too futuristic.
[35:44.05]Yuri's Revenge.
[35:46.98]Oh, I just hit you.
[35:48.16]But you have the ring.
[35:49.72]So see if you got the ring in there.
[35:52.60]Alright, there you go.
[35:53.40]I think I...
[35:55.74]Oh, I see it.
[35:57.20]You know what a great RTS is?
[35:59.36]That people just completely forget about for some reason?
[36:02.26]Uh, the Warhammer 40k RTS.
[36:04.20]It was probably the... Honestly, it might... Yep, might be better than Red Alert, honestly.
[36:09.87]I had no idea what Warhammer was, and I still bought that game and loved it.
[36:13.55]Let's go backwards to the camp and then teleport.
[36:17.98]It's on a ledge.
[36:22.28]Thanks, Poke.
[36:24.04]Alright, we can keep moving.
[36:25.49]not dawn of war 2 or no no no original dawn of war and the expansions that was good good something crazy about that too you know that the dawn of war uh game designer do you know who that is no um I'm gonna say the rock uh that would be the designer of diablo 3.
[36:57.20]didn't know that I didn't know the rock made diablo 3. he did original makes sense checks out very weird I like before they they made it good Vinny oh sorry yeah I was just I like diablo 3 on release I like the paid auction house thing
[37:22.11]I liked it.
[37:22.95]My friend got an iPhone off it.
[37:24.03]Unpopular opinions.
[37:25.43]He sold a burger.
[37:26.09]Wait, he got an iPhone?
[37:27.71]Yeah, dude, my friend got iPhones because he sold a hamburger for like 800 bucks.
[37:34.28]What the fuck?
[37:34.68]That one hamburger item.
[37:38.92]That's awesome.
[37:39.70]Dude, imagine being like 15 playing Diablo 3 and making like money off an item.
[37:43.86]Like a thousand dollars?
[37:45.88]Yeah, it was awesome.
[37:47.26]Something behind that door.
[37:50.97]yeah that sounds really lame what I'm really all about is csgo knives for five thousand dollars but the one d3 tried it that was lame wasn't burning team captain burning team captain TF2 was like 15 grand at one point wasn't it uh maybe I think there was one that was like 12 000 I remember somewhere around there uh Vinny be careful you got two people coming at you okay
[38:19.92]They look angry.
[38:26.29]Yeah, knocked his ass down.
[38:27.93]Whoa.
[38:30.01]Oh boy.
[38:34.23]Got an arm off.
[38:36.35]Get them guys.
[38:37.09]Watch out for your stamina.
[38:37.95]You're low.
[38:44.60]Nice.
[38:45.08]Nice job.
[38:46.51]I loved the Tau in Dawn of War.
[38:49.61]Dude, that hero.
[38:50.05]Wait, there's a chest on there.
[38:51.39]Oh, there is.
[38:53.41]Oh, I forgot we had the ring.
[38:54.77]I was scared.
[38:55.81]I loved that Tau hero.
[38:57.13]What was his XV?
[38:58.43]Whatever his name was.
[38:59.03]He had the flamethrower and he was so weak, but he was a glass cannon.
[39:03.23]I loved it.
[39:03.61]I don't remember that.
[39:06.45]I didn't play a ton of it, but I had it and I enjoyed it for like a couple months, but Warcraft 3 was with me for like 10 years.
[39:12.50]There's a Maladin here.
[39:14.80]Yeah.
[39:17.25]I want to put that on.
[39:20.05]Ring of bricks.
[39:23.67]Did we all get the same treasure?
[39:25.87]I think we might.
[39:26.75]Yeah, I got the same thing.
[39:33.16]It's like a cartoon.
[39:33.88]It's like a cartoon mallet.
[39:35.92]Like this is what Looney Tunes, like this is just a bunch of flies in like Looney Tunes cartoon right now.
[39:44.60]It's amazing.
[39:46.65]Go this way.
[39:51.17]Oh, you can change the animation speed on the characters to make it more janky or less... I don't know... I like it janky.
[40:00.83]I think it's, yeah, I like it the way it is.
[40:04.27]This ring of bricks.
[40:07.29]So I guess, like, to address the elephant in the room, did anyone here actually, like, play RuneScape?
[40:12.07]Since this is kind of that.
[40:13.43]A little bit.
[40:15.12]I played some.
[40:17.38]Nah, never.
[40:18.99]Wait, really?
[40:19.91]If I played it, I'd probably be obsessed with it for the rest of my life.
[40:22.31]That's why I haven't done it.
[40:23.13]You guys never played?
[40:25.53]I did.
[40:26.55]Very briefly.
[40:27.23]I think you guys are going backwards.
[40:28.79]You need to come up here.
[40:30.31]Oh.
[40:32.15]I played it in like... Thank you, Stark.
[40:36.46]Sorry, I'm a stickler for the rules.
[40:38.58]No, do it.
[40:39.14]Do it.
[40:39.42]Let me know.
[40:40.02]Remind me.
[40:41.14]I played RuneScape when it was a browser game...
[40:44.54]and oh there's fall damage guys I used your body to not get hurt wow yeah I liked it it was it was it was good but I I also I played it uh in class on my laptop and that was bad I probably shouldn't have done that but it didn't stick fellas it didn't stick some some people are still playing it to this day so Jerma you're probably right about that like it is the kind of game that just takes your life over
[41:16.03]Can you make real money off of RuneScape, chat?
[41:20.30]Probably.
[41:21.50]Yeah, it'll do.
[41:22.42]Can you buy an iPhone?
[41:25.96]Probably.
[41:26.32]Dude, we just destroyed that guy.
[41:28.38]That guy was supposed to be a challenging enemy, I think, and we just kind of destroyed him.
[41:40.17]This mallet is awesome.
[41:47.51]This is kind of morbid, what I'm doing.
[41:51.37]He's got no head.
[41:55.13]What about this room?
[41:57.49]Room?
[41:58.01]Oh, that's the shortcut.
[41:59.17]Can it be opened?
[42:01.55]That's to go back to the rest camp if you guys wanted to do some resting.
[42:06.27]We should.
[42:06.63]Do you guys remember that one secret route I saw?
[42:15.42]Or the...
[42:17.06]the the alternate route yeah before the bramble yeah let's do it or this is gonna respawn so is there mobs here on the I don't remember if there's any over here it'll respawn but we have a shortcut for the other one so I think it's worth it get some treasure fellas okay I I'm gonna ask do we tp
[42:43.62]Jerma, or anyone.
[42:45.30]Where are we going?
[42:46.10]We're going back to Poke.
[42:47.26]Poke has a secret.
[42:48.76]Is it this way or we TP back to the first or second one?
[42:51.99]For the second one, yeah.
[42:52.91]Let's see this guy's fucking head spread out over the wall.
[42:57.43]Ow, ow, help.
[42:57.99]What were you saying, Vinny?
[43:01.77]Also, I was going to say two things.
[43:03.86]Well, one is the new meta on Twitch is Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
[43:07.46]I just want to recommend that.
[43:08.58]Okay.
[43:08.90]Oh, is it really?
[43:10.04]Yeah.
[43:10.96]So, high recommendation.
[43:12.22]You should play that.
[43:12.92]Okay.
[43:14.33]Lots of people are saying this.
[43:16.15]Lots of many, and I've been playing it.
[43:18.41]It's really good.
[43:19.63]I do have it purchased.
[43:20.83]I was waiting for the right opportunity, and it seems like it's a good one, so I'll do it.
[43:25.69]Yeah, I like it.
[43:28.51]Jerma, you could join my island.
[43:30.47]You can meet my Koropi.
[43:32.59]Is it like Animal Crossing?
[43:33.85]How does it work?
[43:34.87]Yes, it is a little bit.
[43:37.89]Okay.
[43:39.03]It's a cute game where you give gifts to your friends and then you gift furniture for your island.
[43:43.01]But there's island mysteries and there's Zelda puzzles on the island.
[43:46.37]It's nice.
[43:46.83]It's a good game.
[43:47.41]I'd recommend it.
[43:50.17]Alright.
[43:51.29]That sounds pretty sick.
[43:52.25]That sounds good.
[43:52.85]Okay.
[43:53.65]So what I was going to ask was what Legos did you guys grow up with, if any?
[43:57.37]What was your favorite sets?
[44:01.13]um mine I made a boat out of legos and I put it in the sink and I would I was floating it and then I put all the legos back and they got really moldy you can't sell that now we got I don't think I had any sets I'm like a I'm a lego purist ah guys I had pieces never never ever ever put a single thing together with legos in my whole life oh man
[44:30.97]Oh man, that would take over the rest of your life, just like RuneScape.
[44:34.43]I thought you'd be like a Lego castle guy like I was, but yeah.
[44:37.74]What about Hot Wheels?
[44:38.44]I really think it would for you.
[44:39.74]Do you guys have Hot Wheels?
[44:41.50]I like the Hot Wheels.
[44:42.46]Hot Wheels are cool, yeah.
[44:43.78]Yeah, I had a couple.
[44:45.36]I always wish I had those loop ones, you know where it goes like a loop?
[44:50.27]Oh yeah, and it goes up and it goes around and loop to loop and it flies up.
[44:53.99]Yeah, I was so jealous of those commercials.
[44:55.99]I wanted it so bad.
[44:58.86]And he drank your potion.
[44:59.96]Never had it.
[45:01.22]Wait, Sturge, you said that you thought I would be like a Lego guy.
[45:04.19]What does that mean?
[45:04.69]Uh, I don't know.
[45:06.61]I just like it seems like it would.
[45:08.97]It's it's what your brain craves.
[45:12.01]OK, like you made the little claymation monsters.
[45:14.99]It's true.
[45:16.23]Whoa, God, he jumps.
[45:18.73]Oh, OK, this thing actually can kill us.
[45:23.46]I tried to kick it.
[45:24.26]It's bad.
[45:24.84]It's it's hard.
[45:25.56]It's hard.
[45:26.30]I'm going to drink my stuff.
[45:29.63]Guys, this is tough.
[45:30.61]Why is he locked onto me?
[45:33.82]Stop!
[45:34.14]Dude, can you imagine somebody with a mallet just hitting you in the back of the fucking head over and over again?
[45:40.20]You got a block!
[45:42.64]Pranking.
[45:43.98]It's got no head and it's still attacking us.
[45:48.32]There you go.
[45:48.82]Nice.
[45:49.92]Makes a little bit of sense.
[45:50.68]Samurai chest.
[45:52.68]Ooh, arrows.
[45:53.48]Oh, it dropped an IDA?
[45:54.47]Oh, nice.
[45:55.77]Is it separate loot?
[45:56.91]Did we all get it?
[45:57.41]I didn't get it.
[45:58.57]That was not separate.
[45:59.65]I think the chest maybe is.
[46:01.13]Everybody gets it?
[46:02.05]Oh, yeah.
[46:02.35]I'm dropping it.
[46:02.81]I'm dropping it.
[46:04.27]I would use it if it's any good.
[46:06.95]There's a Barnacle from Half-Life on the ceiling here, guys.
[46:14.47]Good eyes.
[46:15.89]Thank you.
[46:16.51]That's my Legolas elf eyes.
[46:19.19]Oh, Legos?
[46:20.24]Oh, this is my BIS.
[46:23.04]There's a lot of interesting stuff in this treasure chest here, guys.
[46:27.40]I don't like that we can't all open it.
[46:30.06]I got it.
[46:30.46]I got mine.
[46:30.90]Uh, I want this one.
[46:37.60]Uh, can I have this, all this?
[46:39.89]It's all yours.
[46:40.43]Okay.
[46:41.99]I didn't get to see any of it.
[46:43.05]Oh, wait, you didn't get to see it?
[46:44.17]Oh.
[46:44.65]No.
[46:45.49]Oh, wow.
[46:45.85]No, it's, it's all... Oh, we get to all have it.
[46:52.21]It's my bits.
[46:54.59]Some of it's not as good as the other stuff, so be careful.
[47:00.89]Like, this is good against magic more than it is, I think.
[47:04.45]Ooh, you're so pretty, though.
[47:06.77]You do get very cool looking.
[47:09.76]Wait, the chest is separate.
[47:13.02]Wait, I'm stupid.
[47:13.62]That's what we're saying.
[47:15.12]Wait, I just looted myself.
[47:19.69]you have to take the friendly fire ring off though if you want more than one ring oh no you could use the other there's another ring slot the shitty ring yeah you get rid of the shitty ring can you sell um I think I don't know good question oh there's an upstairs oh dude what
[47:47.99]This ancient labyrinth continues to grow in front of us, sprawling in every direction.
[47:52.57]Where'd you get the spike shield, mister?
[47:56.06]It's in a treasure chest not far from here.
[48:01.00]We gotta call out treasure chests so everyone- we gotta make sure like everyone gets everything.
[48:04.60]Treasure chest!
[48:07.31]Chest.
[48:08.59]Chest.
[48:10.13]Okay.
[48:10.95]Well that was quick.
[48:13.39]Oh, that's my set.
[48:14.27]That's my bis.
[48:16.21]Ooh.
[48:16.43]Carrying buckler.
[48:18.74]I mean, I'll take it.
[48:19.92]I think I like the hammer, though.
[48:25.00]You guys left me with the worst loot.
[48:28.99]I mean, it's... I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[48:32.33]I'm so confused.
[48:42.21]Okay, so I think I know how this works.
[48:43.87]Whose leak is this?
[48:48.07]12 damage?
[48:51.27]Watch out!
[48:51.97]Bomb!
[48:53.19]What?
[48:54.39]Oh.
[48:54.67]I'm poisoned, I'm poisoned.
[48:57.68]Oh, I'm... I don't like that.
[49:03.08]Wait, someone's coming.
[49:05.70]Bomb?
[49:05.99]Someone is coming, someone is coming.
[49:07.99]Oh, it's bad.
[49:09.37]No, just... Poke his eye out with the spear.
[49:13.59]Nice kick.
[49:15.61]You remember the basics of CQC.
[49:18.79]Really ganging up on them.
[49:22.25]I wonder, are they bosses?
[49:25.10]It kind of has to be, right?
[49:26.90]Probably, yeah.
[49:27.56]It's a neat game so far.
[49:29.44]I'm enjoying this.
[49:33.93]You think the enemies get, like, stronger?
[49:36.43]Yeah, I would imagine so.
[49:37.85]I feel like we are coming in with four people in a game that might not scale.
[49:45.20]Help!
[49:47.20]Wait.
[49:49.22]Drink your potion, Poke.
[49:52.50]Whoa.
[49:54.04]Oh, man.
[49:54.92]Thank you.
[49:55.35]Thank you.
[49:55.67]Wait, I didn't fall all the way.
[50:02.01]Go that far?
[50:04.04]Yeah, I got it.
[50:05.14]You got it.
[50:05.80]You got it.
[50:06.34]Good job.
[50:07.96]So, I think... Okay, enemies drop items that are tied to a specific player.
[50:13.94]Chests are for everyone.
[50:15.41]So, like, for example, there's some, like, leaks that are dropping from these Venus Flytraps that I can't pick up.
[50:20.39]So, I think one of you guys could pick it up.
[50:21.93]The leak sucks, though.
[50:22.67]Don't get it.
[50:25.37]Okay, you need us to come back?
[50:28.37]I'm running all the way back.
[50:29.67]I'm good.
[50:30.21]Yeah.
[50:32.00]I found a way back.
[50:36.92]oh there's I am officially out of arrows leak is good because it does magic type damage maybe some enemies take more damage from magic and then you equip the leak going down this way fellas platforming be careful
[51:03.86]Uh-oh.
[51:05.16]We're never gonna see Poke again.
[51:06.34]Yeah, we should... Hold on.
[51:07.40]Wait till Poke can see where we actually went.
[51:12.02]I got the friendly fire ring on.
[51:13.13]You can't hurt me.
[51:15.07]Oh, we went in the castle.
[51:17.07]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:20.83]The music has changed where I'm at.
[51:22.33]I don't know why I came down here.
[51:23.91]I'm sorry.
[51:26.59]Oh.
[51:27.93]Guys.
[51:29.15]There's nothing there anymore.
[51:30.51]We're done.
[51:30.93]We finished that.
[51:31.53]Wait, what?
[51:34.15]It's the campfire we were at before.
[51:35.73]It just loops back down to the campfire.
[51:38.21]I made it back.
[51:39.79]Wait, are we going all the way back to where we just were?
[51:43.25]Yeah.
[51:44.93]It goes all the way around.
[51:46.33]Was there loot?
[51:47.09]We got the sunflower outfit and the weapon.
[51:50.71]The buckler.
[51:51.25]I feel like there's another path here.
[51:54.19]Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[51:55.29]There's another unexplored path in the bramble.
[51:58.61]Bramble scramble.
[52:02.64]I'll take a quick look.
[52:03.60]I'm going to scout this out.
[52:11.24]What is making that?
[52:12.18]This might be where I fell.
[52:15.90]That's the entrance of the... Yeah.
[52:17.97]There's a camp up here.
[52:18.99]We could just go this way, I guess.
[52:26.83]No?
[52:27.21]I can't pick the leak up either.
[52:30.22]so yeah one of us might be able to who who's that oh hey guys I didn't see you there your whole crew is here alright we have to beat the boss first try vinny this is kind of like your area I do find humor funny the vines camping here maybe just teleport
[52:59.74]Usually when Vines show up in a video game, my chat's like, Vinny, check it out.
[53:04.00]It's your thing.
[53:06.47]I'm like, that's awesome.

[53:34.84]A reference?
[53:36.14]Hey, look at this thing.
[53:37.76]It's actually an onion.
[53:39.54]Where are you?
[53:40.08]How did you get that?
[53:41.14]Oh, that's cool.
[53:41.84]Pretty cool.
[53:42.98]Wait.
[53:43.94]It dropped off of an enemy right here.
[53:46.42]There's an enemy fighting the Venus fly traps right now.
[53:49.02]It's kind of cool.
[53:51.50]I'm not saying sorry.
[53:52.23]I don't care.
[53:53.19]That's alright, folk.
[53:53.89]I don't accept anyway.
[53:56.07]This guy got the 1% drop.
[53:57.17]You guys are going to die over there.
[54:00.89]yeah there you go poke you don't even know this is a weird weapon I hate these guys can we go to the campfire you don't get experience there's a chest right there there's a chest up here yeah how do we get it there better be like a bomb in here poison drink your potions

[56:31.71]Oh, man.
[56:32.29]I love Poke so much.
[56:35.93]Can you guys calm him down?
[56:44.49]We still haven't done VRChat, Poke.
[56:46.11]I know.
[56:46.39]I'm so excited for that.
[56:47.83]We're going to do it one day.
[56:51.75]You guys need to be on all the state-of-the-art top-of-the-line VR so we can all enjoy crazy maps.
[57:00.41]I like VR for two hours I haven't done it I haven't played in a long time um um I would love to like I'm talking like finding the coolest obscurest maps even the games too dude I used to love just opening up random VR games that had multiplayer and it was just absolute nonsense
[57:22.63]yeah there's a lot of fun to be had but here's a here's a question how long can everyone here stay in VR before they start getting not forever good forever like like three minutes oh really it's like three-ish hour three to four hours for me total no I'm I'm good
[57:39.22]Yeah, I got three to four hours myself.
[57:40.60]Eat ginger if you get mind sickness.
[57:45.43]Mind sickness?
[57:46.35]I love the Dungeons & Dragons terminology.
[57:49.21]That's awesome.
[57:49.65]Mind sickness.
[57:51.43]The mind player.
[57:52.21]I'm going to start saying that from now on.
[58:00.91]Was that doing anything, dude?
[58:04.49]Because you guys don't look like you're getting hurt.
[58:06.67]No, I'm doing alright.
[58:07.87]I think it stacks up.
[58:09.43]The poison stacks up, I think.
[58:11.43]Poison needs to build, right?
[58:13.93]So that stack needs to go all the way to the right before you actually get poisoned, I think.
[58:22.35]I think that's what Poke said, but just differently.
[58:24.65]Sorry.
[58:26.20]I'm known to do that.
[58:28.96]Am I even hurting anybody with this thing?
[58:31.20]It's doing 23.
[58:33.44]Us?
[58:33.52]Oh, oh, oh.
[58:37.05]I'm just making sure this thing's doing damage.
[58:38.33]It feels like it's not sometimes.
[58:42.49]Get their asses.
[58:45.88]Yeah.
[58:48.32]Ow.
[58:50.54]I'm getting blinded.
[58:52.46]I can finally pick up the leaks.

[60:09.74]We're supposed to call out chest.
[60:11.24]Chest.
[60:11.62]Everyone reacts when we call out the chest.
[60:13.26]Okay.

[60:19.54]Oh, shit.
[60:19.94]How do we get up there, Vinny?
[60:21.84]Um... I'm gonna try this way, Jerm.
[60:27.34]It's this way.
[60:27.90]Yeah, we're good.
[60:29.76]It's got arrows in it.
[60:31.92]arrows is good alright cool you can combine stacks but you got to do it outside of your uh oh oh 24 is the maximum stack okay I see
[60:57.57]So are we heading down or are we heading up?
[61:00.01]Oh, this way.
[61:00.85]There's a couple of those Half-Life monsters.
[61:02.55]Well, this is a crazy room.
[61:04.95]Chest.
[61:06.81]Oh, you guys are all behind me anyways.
[61:09.67]Yeah.
[61:11.53]Let me in.
[61:13.17]Let me lead for once.
[61:14.23]I got him.
[61:21.57]Yeah, kill that artichoke.
[61:25.27]Clear it first before we go in.
[61:30.06]Let me in.
[61:31.92]Stop.
[61:32.32]Shut the fuck up, okay?
[61:33.80]I'm busy.
[61:36.80]Evil Jerma has logged in.
[61:39.89]Alright, let's go.
[61:42.17]Let me in.
[61:42.85]Alright, go.
[61:43.99]You go.
[61:44.41]I move.
[61:44.75]One at a time.
[61:45.93]Alright.
[61:47.65]Ooh, ring of leaves.
[61:48.81]Wait, who can pick this up?
[61:54.36]I can't pick it up.
[61:55.64]I can't either.
[62:00.98]Is anybody kicking frequently?
[62:04.06]Not as much as I should.
[62:05.12]That's a good reminder.
[62:05.98]Because this ring makes kicks better if anybody wants it.
[62:11.08]What are these called from Half-Life?
[62:12.98]Barnacles.
[62:15.12]Who wants to smell bad?
[62:17.30]Or good?
[62:17.70]Who wants to smell bad?
[62:19.50]This has got a summoner thing in it.
[62:21.54]We are from France.
[62:26.74]Was that Mars Attacks?
[62:29.70]No, that is coneheads.
[62:32.14]Oh, I thought you were doing that.
[62:33.26]Yeah, I love those guys, but no, no, no.
[62:39.86]Oh, my God.
[62:40.96]A book.
[62:43.64]Oh, this is the room from the beginning of the game.
[62:46.05]Wait, who wants to be caster?
[62:48.01]The whole world's connected.
[62:49.91]Oh, no.
[62:51.27]We just... Are they friendly?
[62:53.75]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[62:54.65]They are not friendly.
[62:56.21]They are unfriendly.
[62:56.87]Wait, what?
[62:58.61]Wait, the things you summon are not friendly.
[63:00.57]No, looks like they're not.
[63:02.67]We can use them to our advantage in an annoying room, but I don't think we should use this spell frequently.
[63:09.16]We should call it out when we use it.
[63:11.74]So let's do code name.
[63:14.14]Vinny, somebody in my chat is talking about... You're fucking dead.
[63:20.57]Can we res you?
[63:21.35]Oh, you can res.
[63:22.13]I used a flash charge.
[63:23.81]Flash, yeah.
[63:26.64]What are they talking about, Charm?
[63:27.82]Somebody said that Coneheads sucks ass.
[63:30.26]I haven't seen it in a very long time.
[63:32.52]Whoa.
[63:32.76]Yeah, it's kind of bad.
[63:36.58]Is it bad?
[63:38.04]They did the SNL skits and then there was a movie, right?
[63:40.78]Yeah, it was a movie.
[63:41.84]They did that too much where it was like, here's a skit that works great in three minutes and then here's a movie.
[63:47.24]I like Coneheads movie.
[63:48.66]I saw it again for the first time like three, four years ago.
[63:52.22]It's got a couple moments that are funny.
[63:56.25]Wait, is there a scene where he chugs something?
[64:00.73]He's drinking something.
[64:03.05]He drinks a milkshake fast.
[64:04.56]Am I crazy?
[64:05.80]Yeah.
[64:06.58]There's some drink that he gulps the whole thing.
[64:08.64]He's like, yum, something like that.
[64:11.16]Yeah, that's exactly.
[64:14.80]That is probably what the whole scene is.
[64:16.63]Wow, man.
[64:17.75]Let's remember how great that movie was.
[64:21.26]I like, do you remember Nargal the Garthok?
[64:23.58]Which is the name of fighting the Rancor, basically, at the end of the movie.
[64:28.21]Oh, that's right.
[64:28.99]The big claymation monster.
[64:30.21]Yeah.
[64:30.51]It's a little spooky down here.
[64:34.71]Whoa.
[64:37.09]Do you guys have an OLED monitor?
[64:39.73]Yeah.
[64:40.47]I do, yes.
[64:41.73]Dude, it's so dark here.
[64:43.47]Wow.
[64:44.15]Thank, I know.
[64:47.11]I'm an OLED guy.
[64:49.13]I can't go back from OLED now.
[64:50.27]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[64:50.83]I'm like screwed forever.
[64:51.61]I want all of you, everyone point at Ster and yell at him and laugh at him at the same time.
[64:57.08]Why?
[64:57.74]Do you guys have... He doesn't want the OLED, the cool part of the OLED, he doesn't want it on.
[65:04.72]Wait, what do you mean?
[65:05.54]Like HDR.
[65:06.32]Yeah.
[65:08.66]Wait, isn't the cool part of... Wait, when you say... The cool part of OLED is the black.
[65:14.19]Yeah, the high dynamic range.
[65:16.53]He turned that off.
[65:18.09]That's not HDR.
[65:18.81]Is that HDR?
[65:20.63]HDR is lame.
[65:22.27]He turned it off.
[65:23.63]Wait, is that actually HDR?
[65:25.89]HDR and OLED are different.
[65:27.61]That's my chat.
[65:28.83]Yeah.
[65:30.80]but oleds can do better hdr but hdr itself that's what I'm saying Jerma has his head on backwards he's playing this I watched back to his monitor I watched elemental at hdr 10 in dolby vision and I seriously thought I was in the movie that was the brightest most beautiful colors I've ever seen in my whole life well it's not gonna trick me like that
[65:56.33]I'll know I'm not in the movie, so it doesn't work as well.
[66:01.34]Alright.
[66:04.16]I thought I was a conehead.
[66:05.54]Like, seriously, I watched it.
[66:06.50]I thought I was part of the family.
[66:09.42]I was fighting the Rancor.
[66:11.41]You are a valued part of our family.
[66:14.19]Hey, that's fine.
[66:14.79]I was like, wow, thank you, Dan Aykroyd.
[66:19.27]Those that know, you know.
[66:21.55]You've seen it.
[66:22.05]No, remember, Jerma tried to get me to try HDR.
[66:24.47]He's like, just open up any game and do it.
[66:26.17]I opened up Overwatch.
[66:27.55]Overwatch has, okay.
[66:29.45]And it made me have to like turn my computer off with how much it broke it.
[66:32.81]Dude, some, okay, some game studios turned on HDR as just like, I guess we're going to fucking put that in.
[66:38.60]You need one that's crafted.
[66:39.92]Like, hey.

[67:13.28]Okay.
[67:13.70]Yep.
[67:13.88]What do you mean?
[67:14.77]Wait, what do you mean?
[67:17.39]I'm going this way, guys.
[67:18.43]There's a whole other path down here we missed.
[67:20.59]It's crazy down here.
[67:21.43]What do you mean a fucked up PS5, though?
[67:25.71]Were you going to put, like, viruses on it?
[67:27.93]Yeah.
[67:29.02]I was going to load it with a bunch of fucking, like, personal videos of me, like, on the couch and shit.
[67:33.14]Spoilers.
[67:33.76]Now he's never going to do it.
[67:35.02]No, no, no.
[67:35.28]Now I have to do it because now, like, people know that, like, one of the jokes.
[67:39.34]personal videos?
[67:41.28]I was going to say, Ster some personal videos.
[67:45.16]Wait, how do you fish?
[67:45.88]I don't have one.
[67:46.54]You pressed five.
[67:48.66]You should have got one from the beginning.
[67:50.00]I didn't talk to him.
[67:51.88]Oh, you messed up.
[67:57.56]I guess I'll just watch you fish.
[67:59.28]I judge a game based on whether or not it has a fishing minigame, so I'm pleased to see this.
[68:02.83]I think I actually have a full inventory of these things I can eat.
[68:09.54]Do we need to put bait on the fishing line or no?
[68:11.72]Can I leave the game, get the fish thing, and then come back?
[68:13.92]No, I think we have too many rods up and they're getting confused.
[68:18.80]Yeah.
[68:22.76]Uh, there's a fish just out of the water.
[68:24.80]I'm not getting anything, dog.
[68:31.10]I don't need fish.
[68:32.32]There are too many rods in this pond.
[68:35.54]Sorry.
[68:36.18]Like it?
[68:36.62]Jerma, this is a problem.
[68:38.52]I don't know why I'm telling you specifically but it's a problem I do an impression of something silly that I enjoy doing then it just keeps happening all stream and my chat's like vinny you need to stop oh like you're embarrassing us yeah sorry you gotta wait till he gobbles there's a gob you're pulling it too soon is that a grapefish wait till it gobbles
[69:03.02]My whole community has mind sickness at this point, so it doesn't really matter.
[69:08.47]I got you.
[69:09.09]Okay.
[69:09.59]Eat some ginger.
[69:10.41]Guys, you guys need ginger.
[69:13.31]I like ginger, actually.
[69:14.43]I keep some on hand just for that occasion.
[69:18.23]Mind sickness.
[69:19.97]Thank you.
[69:20.61]Yes, Poke, you've introduced a whole new thing.
[69:23.21]It's a great way to put it.
[69:24.53]It's wonderful.
[69:28.69]It's the energy drink.
[69:29.55]I told you guys.
[69:31.89]You were like, stop me if I say weird stuff.
[69:34.13]Why would we?
[69:37.13]Can you fuck people up with the fish and pool?
[69:40.43]I don't think we're getting out of this room.
[69:45.52]Wait, wait, wait.
[69:46.10]Can you guys fish and give me fish?
[69:48.56]Can we see?
[69:50.72]Yep.
[69:53.26]I just got two big ones here for you.
[69:55.94]Alright, I'll just get extra fish and I'll stay here.
[70:03.16]I think we could probably fish two at a time.
[70:04.92]Maybe no more than two.
[70:05.72]Just separate your hooks.
[70:06.86]Yeah, there's too many people fishing.
[70:15.28]Wait, what happens?
[70:16.20]It just jumps out?
[70:16.84]It gets on the lure and then you have to slowly reel it in.
[70:22.98]And then when you get it all the way close to you, you can pull the rod out too.
[70:26.03]I don't know why you would do that though.
[70:36.69]I'm going to use the bathroom.
[70:38.15]I like to say bathroom.
[70:40.35]Say restroom in your own home.
[70:41.75]Have some respect.
[70:44.03]The men's room.
[70:45.09]Is that what people say?
[70:45.82]People say men's room?
[70:46.62]Lavatory.
[70:49.84]Oh, lavatory.
[70:50.72]Yeah, use the lavatory.
[70:53.98]Sounds like a laboratory.
[70:54.91]I don't use that.
[70:56.37]WC.
[71:05.80]oh man come on get it you know you want the hook they're like bumping into each other it's weird oh there you go you look too early okay I'm good I got one I got one of each I'm pretty happy about that one one fish is lettuce the other one's grapes like alright uh
[71:34.98]Yeah, this one is... Is this a watermelon?
[71:39.61]Yeah, this one's a watermelon.
[71:40.45]You're a watermelon?
[71:41.33]I do.
[71:41.77]Take a look.
[71:42.45]Hello, Raggy.
[71:44.87]It's happening again.
[71:46.07]See?
[71:46.93]Oh, man.
[71:50.59]No, don't start doing Scooby-Doo.
[71:52.41]I'll start doing it.
[72:03.97]So, you know, I've been drinking a lot of lately and it's wonderful and I recommend all people of Earth.
[72:11.92]The moonshine thing?
[72:12.92]I'm not drinking moonshine.
[72:15.52]It's peppermint tea.
[72:17.10]Everybody out here better be drinking this.
[72:19.92]That's what he said to me on the phone the other day.
[72:21.70]I can't believe I'm the only one.
[72:24.27]Everybody on Earth needs some of this.
[72:30.27]I get exactly what you're saying.
[72:32.57]And that's why it's... I... That was... I love that one.
[72:36.02]That was actually a great one.
[72:37.78]Really?
[72:38.60]No, honestly.
[72:39.42]That was like a 10 out of 10.
[72:42.33]The whole world's got to taste this.
[72:44.61]Yeah, that's like every single one of those characters.
[72:46.69]But it was actually herbal tea.
[72:48.30]Yeah.
[72:49.52]Isn't peppermint tea good for your stomach, though?
[72:51.28]Is that true, Jerma?
[72:51.98]Has it been good for your stomach?
[72:53.26]Let me tell you.
[72:55.04]It has been life-changing.
[72:57.38]Are you serious?
[72:58.68]Oh, man.
[72:59.12]I could use that because lately my stomach's been weird.
[73:03.23]Peppermint was the opposite for me.
[73:05.65]You guys are going the wrong way.
[73:07.51]Where is this going?
[73:09.63]That's like the trap room we did already.
[73:11.83]We did?
[73:12.11]Yeah.
[73:14.21]So what's back out this way?
[73:17.02]We haven't gone past the soldier man.
[73:19.22]Well, there's that way and then there's that way.
[73:24.38]I just muted for a second.
[73:25.48]I am dead serious.
[73:27.26]Peppermint tea.
[73:28.36]Just get the good shit.
[73:29.66]Get the organic shit.
[73:30.66]Get like the real good mint leaves.
[73:32.12]Peppermint leaves.
[73:34.69]It's absolutely wonderful.
[73:36.45]It's super good for stress.
[73:37.59]It's super good for your stomach.
[73:39.41]Just don't drink a shitload of it because it's kind of harsh if you drink too much.
[73:43.31]But I drank a cup every day before bed.
[73:47.32]And I drank a cup when I wake up in the morning.
[73:49.26]It's like a coffee now.
[73:50.28]I'm dead serious.
[73:52.98]Try it.
[73:53.88]Seriously.
[73:55.60]Chest!
[73:56.32]Chest!
[73:56.70]Chest?
[73:57.09]Chest!
[73:57.81]Chest!
[73:58.47]Chest!
[73:58.87]And a dead man.
[74:00.71]Where, sir?
[74:01.23]Oh, I see where you are.
[74:02.33]Hey, hey, Sin.
[74:03.27]Sin City.
[74:04.03]One of my mods.
[74:06.11]Not in chat, though.
[74:06.87]But what did you give me?
[74:08.23]You gave me poop tea.
[74:09.47]It was like a marmoset that ate something and they turned it into tea after it pooped it out.
[74:14.42]What is that?
[74:17.70]What?
[74:17.86]What?
[74:18.57]I don't know.
[74:18.95]Vinny's eating poop.
[74:19.65]What was that?
[74:20.21]That was loud as shit.
[74:23.05]That is really loud.
[74:25.33]Wrong animal.
[74:30.71]Poop coffee.
[74:32.00]Yeah, it was some poop tea.
[74:33.56]I was weird.
[74:34.10]I don't know.
[74:38.14]Poop is a word you can't really say.
[74:40.34]Are we doing this?
[74:41.66]Without it sounding.
[74:44.04]Can we rest again?
[74:44.86]Because I fell and took ball damage.
[74:47.53]It was coffee, and it's the most expensive coffee in the world.
[74:50.45]Not the one he gave me.
[74:51.75]He gave me poop tea.
[74:54.21]Civet.
[74:54.73]It's weird.
[74:55.27]That's a cool one.
[74:57.11]Yeah, I don't know.
[74:58.09]I wouldn't recommend that, by the way, Hoke.
[75:00.07]I'm not recommending it.
[75:01.57]Gamers, this might be like a boss.
[75:04.19]They're saying Kopi Luwak.
[75:07.61]but peppermint tea seriously is that a bad word I just said what I just read I don't know I don't know who knows oh my god oh my god who knows anyway in some language delete your streams yeah yeah oh it was coffee okay I would like the three of you to I can't term a peppermint tea makes me oh oh watch out watch out watch out he doesn't
[75:35.70]Oh, I heard it, but what did you... Did you use like eight tea bags?
[75:40.95]No.
[75:45.89]What is he doing?
[75:49.00]Great, of course.
[76:00.61]Ooh, good.
[76:02.09]Did that kill him?
[76:03.47]That was insane.
[76:04.63]Oh, he's coming up.
[76:05.35]No, he's coming back.
[76:06.43]Yo, sick weapon in this chest, guys.
[76:09.67]Wait, wait, poke, come back.
[76:12.05]Wait, wait, wait, poke.
[76:13.05]Poke, poke, come back, come back.
[76:14.17]I'm coming.
[76:16.51]We got him now.
[76:18.07]Ooh.
[76:18.67]Look at the setup.
[76:23.89]You might want to put it right here, though.
[76:26.59]In the front.
[76:26.97]I think he's going to jump over it.
[76:31.59]Oh wait, wait a minute.
[76:32.05]I can do this too.
[76:33.59]There's a cool weapon in the chest.
[76:37.48]Just block him completely.
[76:40.56]But now we have to deal with that.
[76:41.88]Yeah, now we do.
[76:43.10]Yeah.
[76:44.04]That shit's stronger than the boss.
[76:47.46]Ooh.
[76:48.00]Wait, what'd you guys get?
[76:48.76]Is it always the same?
[76:49.86]Yeah, same.
[76:50.68]The Nagatina, was it called?
[76:52.71]Yeah.
[76:53.15]Ooh, that thing's cool.
[76:54.55]Naganata.
[76:55.89]Yeah.
[76:59.38]Delete your VODs, I said.
[77:05.33]I mean, they're getting deleted anyway, according to Twitch, but that's a whole other fucking story.
[77:09.13]Oh, that's right.
[77:09.75]Twitch is deleting all highlights and fucking like uploads that you've ever done.
[77:14.11]Yeah, up to 100 hours.
[77:15.61]You're being drama Queens.
[77:17.95]Highlights.
[77:18.51]I said highlights, not like highlights.
[77:22.32]no there's some announcement I'd have to actually like yeah it's not it's not great for people that have put all your shit on YouTube guys that's why you know do that soon do it now they said that it will only affect 0.5% of Twitch users who have that many VODs I've been streaming on Twitch for 13 years so I wonder I got some stuff that'll be affected don't know I'll have to go look into that too um crazy stuff over this way
[78:01.66]I love drama we're just making conversation dude I swear this guy is firing blood at us all hours calling me on the phone and he's like dude did you hear what happened dude check live stream fails right now where and it's like a clip of him and he wants me to upvote it
[78:31.18]I think the last time I got posted there was because I made a funny voice on my stream like five years ago.
[78:36.59]They were like, and I said that.
[78:39.45]And then they were like, wow.
[78:41.05]And now it's very different.
[78:42.53]Now it's like, this person is bad.
[78:45.08]It's no more about you failed at Mario Brothers, you know?
[78:50.52]I've never been there.
[78:53.85]Crazy.
[78:56.33]Yeah, you used to be able to just like be bad at video games and get posted.
[78:59.79]That's all I want.
[79:01.67]I want to be bad at video games.
[79:02.61]I can't hurt this guy.
[79:05.37]He's being a little weirdo.
[79:13.82]I'll call you later though, Ster after the stream.
[79:17.34]Yeah, I will.
[79:18.12]I will upvote your Super Mario fail.
[79:20.66]Thank you.
[79:21.44]That's all I've wanted forever.
[79:23.08]It was really funny with the raccoon tail and everything.
[79:26.19]Mm-hmm.
[79:26.65]Can we make this a three-way call?
[79:29.79]Could.
[79:31.57]We could even do four.
[79:32.53]No, no, no, just three.
[79:33.93]Keep everyone in.
[79:34.69]Okay.
[79:37.43]Hey, Ster, I wanted to ask you.
[79:42.61]So I hear that you've been to Wildwood, New Jersey.
[79:49.61]What's it all about out there?
[79:51.71]Yeah.
[79:52.65]This thing does a lot of damage.
[79:54.97]That's the jersey update.
[79:57.18]Oh, the jersey update.
[79:57.82]Wait, you finished it, you said?
[79:58.92]Or you're still watching?
[80:00.10]I just finished it yesterday.
[80:02.24]What did you think of... May I ask, without getting into spoilers, how did you feel about the ending?
[80:08.16]When he punches the gas tank?
[80:11.70]When he punches the gas tank with brass knuckles?
[80:13.82]Yeah, tell me about that.
[80:14.40]And he just cuts to black after he punches it?
[80:17.55]it goes and then he punches it and then yeah I I had always known about the ending I now having seen everything I especially like it more because I think it'll you know there's a lot more going on in that final episode than I would have thought there's there's like videos to this day people analyzing that ending I don't know if I like by the way he's referencing a video we did like eight years ago I don't think they either one of them know that
[80:42.44]tell you how it could have ended it could have been the mafia Avengers wait can we get like they summon a portal and al capone like goes through and like John goddy I want to be here I want to listen that just because I'm not talking about the sopranos doesn't mean I'm very interested in the conversation I am listening and I'm engaged and he goes on your left and on his on his left is like John goddy yeah did he go in the portal you never do anything
[81:10.27]Are we talking about the one scene where he goes black?
[81:14.37]Like it just cuts?
[81:16.29]Yes, he goes... What did you... What?
[81:18.63]How did you say that?
[81:21.31]Um... Um, um, um, um, um.
[81:27.71]Oh god, now you.
[81:29.13]Oh no.
[81:29.61]I told you this was... What you did was fucked up.
[81:32.13]You should do Conehead's impressions instead.
[81:34.71]They are much better.
[81:35.77]Alright, what do we do?
[81:36.53]Why are you summoning more monsters?
[81:40.41]Oh my god, that looks cool.
[81:41.85]I'm gonna shoot it.
[81:42.49]What if we shoot the sack?
[81:45.59]You can hurt the things on the ground.
[81:47.03]I don't know.
[81:47.61]They're eating me.
[81:49.21]Hmm.
[81:58.06]Is there a way to get up there to do some melee?
[81:59.72]Oh, there is, fellas.
[82:00.60]There is.
[82:00.96]Ooh.
[82:06.46]Why is there no music?
[82:08.64]There is.
[82:09.00]Yeah, you'd expect...
[82:10.27]I hear nothing.
[82:11.33]I hear like spooky jams.
[82:14.11]No, I hear nothing.
[82:14.91]I'm bugged.
[82:18.05]I'll get it.
[82:18.55]I got it.
[82:18.91]I do hear nothing.
[82:21.20]I'm bugged.
[82:22.34]I'm up here.
[82:23.60]I hear it now.
[82:26.28]This is not fitting POS music.
[82:27.78]This is like gachapon music in Japan.
[82:30.98]Wait, what the hell?
[82:32.33]Like when you go to a pachinko arcade.
[82:35.69]They play this.
[82:37.23]I'm gonna get some good loot out of this.
[82:38.99]Somebody's hitting my worm!
[82:45.97]Wait, the music changed.
[82:48.13]Now it's sinister Gachapon music.
[82:52.79]Oh!
[82:54.51]Wow.
[82:55.17]Oh, God, fellas.
[82:56.11]Holy shit!
[82:59.71]Are we alright?
[83:01.35]Yeah.
[83:01.99]Is that the whole game?
[83:05.57]Yo, what is going on with the music?
[83:09.71]It's the dance emote.
[83:10.99]Changes the whole music.
[83:17.19]Who, uh... So we go down here, like in that one scene in Super Metroid, but opposite.
[83:21.64]Oh, loot!
[83:23.58]Also, did Jerma just hawk to it in slow motion?
[83:27.34]Hmm?
[83:30.78]Just me?
[83:32.12]Ooh.
[83:34.28]root raw row of roots this is a spell alright whoa cast its name is amorphophallus immensus amorphophallus
[84:04.05]Oh, Arthur.
[84:05.83]Oh, Arthur.
[84:10.56]I got the Vinny spell.
[84:14.60]Oh, next level.
[84:16.38]Dude, I thought like you killed the server after you said that and just left.
[84:21.71]Next level, it's over.
[84:23.41]Dude, I'm going to go practice.
[84:25.25]What's wrong with my weapon?
[84:26.41]That'd be strange, honestly.
[84:30.34]I cannot wait until I get like six Tanya's.
[84:33.04]It's going to be like, let's rock, let's rock, let's rock.
[84:42.12]I can't wait for the people that never saw that game to experience that for the first time too.
[84:47.67]Like that was just our, we just grew up hearing these things and it was normal.
[84:52.85]Sorry, it's the mind sickness.
[84:53.87]It's fucking me up today.
[84:55.09]That's alright.
[84:56.37]What's the air pressure out today?
[84:57.51]Probably high.
[84:58.79]Sorry.
[84:59.29]It snowed.
[85:02.49]it's snowing so much where are you again poke Texas it's snowed here what the hell's going on real quick oh the music you guys hear this oh yeah I'm ready to play some pachinko yeah was somebody dancing during the boss
[85:35.38]Somebody was dancing during the boss.
[85:38.08]This is definitely a game to play with three other streamers.
[85:40.90]Wait, are you trying to play Red Alert?
[85:45.86]What's going on?
[85:49.00]Which Red Alert do you want to play, Jerma?
[85:50.42]Which one?
[85:52.12]Red Alert 1 is probably the best one.
[85:55.13]You have that collection, yeah?
[85:56.61]I do.
[85:57.79]Yeah.
[85:59.13]Yeah, we got to play that.
[86:01.19]I mean, but once you open the door to RTS games, I'm like...
[86:05.67]You know, I want to play Starcraft.
[86:07.28]I want to play Warcraft 3.
[86:09.72]Warcraft 3 is kind of... There's been some fun little tournaments and stuff.
[86:15.64]It's not like the Tyler1 stuff and it's grubby and those guys.
[86:19.56]That's cool.
[86:22.30]Yeah, I mean, and they did a new release of it and they botched it again.
[86:27.88]But no, it's okay because they updated it and now it's better from what I've been told.
[86:31.83]So it's actually really fun to play.
[86:34.39]So...
[86:35.79]I am all for all these old blizzard games coming back not the new ones sure what new ones World of Warcraft well I mean they like what else did they release oh diablo and diablo 4 yeah did you play four I forget yeah I'm yeah it was I slept through it let's be honest yeah it was an amusement park ride
[87:03.50]And I like amusement park rides, but it's... No, it made him angry.
[87:07.29]I hated it.
[87:08.73]I'm actually really kind of putting a cap on how much I didn't like it.
[87:12.65]Drama?
[87:14.11]Wow.
[87:15.15]It was a drama call, but Diablo 4.
[87:17.49]Yeah.
[87:18.93]Did you play... One more question, Jerm.
[87:20.99]I think I asked you this last time, but did you play Path of Exile 2 yet or no?
[87:24.93]I did, yeah.
[87:25.49]I thought it was really good.
[87:27.08]Cool, okay.
[87:27.98]Just checking.
[87:28.68]Although I would like to wait until a sword is in the game.
[87:34.31]That would be nice.
[87:34.95]Yeah, I like swords in video games too, but I just kind of got used to the fact that I'll forever be using a crossbow.
[87:41.45]Are you playing Path of Exile's one new season tomorrow, Legacy of Faericia, with 19 new ascendancy classes?
[87:46.65]That is tomorrow?
[87:48.10]Are you actually playing that?
[87:51.34]You don't even know me.
[87:52.78]I don't.
[87:54.60]No.
[87:55.86]I think PoE might Ster, what do you've got, like at least probably 5,000 to 10,000 hours in that game.
[88:02.54]At minimum 10,000.
[88:03.34]Oh, okay.
[88:04.00]Okay, I see now.
[88:06.22]Yeah, sir.
[88:06.84]I'd never played PoE 1.
[88:08.02]Just 2.
[88:10.64]I like ARPGs.
[88:11.72]I enjoy them.
[88:12.36]But, I mean, Diablo II was the one I, you know, lost my life to.
[88:16.13]Big learning curve.
[88:17.33]But it is, I'd still say it's a thousand times better than PoE 2.
[88:21.83]Other than PoE 2 is like, the first three acts very good.
[88:25.39]But as like a full game, it's got a lot.
[88:27.79]You've got a lot to go.
[88:28.47]Yeah.
[88:30.81]PeeWee1's got that tenure of content head start.
[88:34.13]PeeWee1.
[88:34.57]Ooh, spear.
[88:37.71]Beetle spear.
[88:40.11]Ooh.
[88:42.03]I now have three spears.
[88:43.57]Yeah, I'm sure PeeWee2 is going to be great.
[88:47.19]I just want to wait until there's not just heavy mallet in the game.
[88:51.53]Right.
[88:52.43]Yeah, it needs a little more time in the oven, but I'm enjoying it.
[88:55.07]I kind of play a little here and there.
[88:56.41]I mean, like I said, the new big thing for me is Hello Kitty Island Adventure, so...
[89:00.45]true yeah true guys I'm I jumped off and I'm in a I'm in a house or guys I made my game look fried I put the fried option oh hold on let me try that I'm throwing down a vine for you wait fire blue oh this oh
[89:24.56]Yeah, this is actually kind of cool.
[89:27.12]Put the crunch all the way up.
[89:28.94]Fried in the crunch all the way up.
[89:31.76]I actually don't hate this.
[89:32.78]This actually is kind of cool looking.
[89:35.10]Let me trick that out.
[89:38.99]Can we turn off the hood?
[89:45.59]Oh, don't do that one.
[89:47.10]Whatever the one after fried is.
[89:49.82]Oh my God.
[89:52.14]fire blue that hurt the FPS make the FPS 30. this is what it's all about wow oh that I yeah I don't know actually whatever I'll play like this I kind of oh man probably a bad place to try this
[90:24.27]My audience can barely see what's happening.
[90:26.63]The pit rate is so bad.
[90:30.61]I thought you fell off.
[90:31.57]I can't.
[90:32.13]I can't.
[90:32.53]What the fuck?
[90:35.67]It actually looks so cool.
[90:37.49]Yo, there's like a... I don't know.
[90:38.62]I can't tell.
[90:39.06]I can't help you.
[90:39.78]I'm blind.
[90:40.36]What is this?
[90:42.18]Oh, nice.
[90:42.60]He's gone.
[90:44.84]It's like a witch bug lady or something.
[90:54.40]This doesn't look that bad.
[90:55.20]It looks good.
[90:55.86]I put the longest animation speed, too, for both of us.
[90:58.04]I like it.
[91:00.06]Oh.
[91:02.45]Why is the pet harder than anything?
[91:05.61]I'm going to die.
[91:06.19]Yeah, I need a different one.
[91:07.99]Someone's a friendly spider.
[91:09.33]Just leave him alone.
[91:12.13]I do believe that it's friendly.
[91:14.17]Oh, look out here.
[91:14.77]What's that?
[91:16.35]Wow.
[91:18.71]Looks like text or something.
[91:22.79]That's a lot of places we need to go.
[91:24.15]Alright, I'll follow you, Pogue.
[91:30.07]Spell da- Oh, the long spear.
[91:32.45]That's also spell damage.
[91:33.74]Interesting.
[91:35.86]Yeah, let's go down here.
[91:38.60]22 power.
[91:42.76]Wish I could turn off my HUD.
[91:44.80]My HUD's big.
[91:45.80]Oh, we got- Hold on.
[91:46.48]A couple of scary enemies here.
[91:54.30]I'm at the next checkpoint.
[91:55.40]I'm ready.
[91:57.32]Uh-oh.
[91:58.74]Uh-oh.
[91:59.64]Am I dead?
[92:00.08]I got you.
[92:01.33]I'm dead.
[92:02.21]I'm alive.
[92:04.05]This is a chest.
[92:08.17]Ster, they found a chest.
[92:12.53]Maybe we shouldn't have gone off without them.
[92:15.45]Let's go to the end of the game.
[92:24.68]leaf spear another spear jeez here they're going a lot of items with the spears we're very split I don't know that there's a solution where are you going Vinny I'm just killing beehives I don't know is that thing alive

[92:52.12]Oh my god.
[92:52.60]I almost didn't make that.
[92:53.68]Oh my god.
[92:54.02]You should probably go the other way towards them.
[92:56.42]You wanna go towards them and then bring them here?
[92:58.08]Oh shit.
[92:58.36]Poke that's fucking money bags down here.

[93:13.51]I already turned him off.
[93:15.69]Me too.
[93:16.09]Yeah.
[93:16.69]I couldn't do it.
[93:17.69]My audience couldn't even see what I was playing.
[93:21.53]Okay, so what is this?
[93:22.59]Tornado.
[93:24.21]That's not a tornado.
[93:27.83]What the hell did I just do?
[93:31.75]Oh, shit.
[93:32.45]Wrong button.

[93:59.14]That was weirdly funny.
[94:02.05]Who just sneezed like that?
[94:06.15]I could recognize that sneeze anywhere, but I'm not going to rat.
[94:10.47]Okay.
[94:14.22]Oh, that's your spider.

[95:04.33]Two spiders in a trench coat.

[96:45.33]Mm-hmm.
[96:47.44]Sounds like a politician.
[96:49.02]It's like a funny name.
[96:49.94]Wait, who was I?
[96:52.54]Political activist involved in consumer protection, environmentalism, and mind... Mind... Mind control.
[97:00.52]Mind sickness.
[97:02.26]Oh, mind sick.
[97:03.06]Oh.
[97:09.72]Did you sneeze?
[97:10.34]Uh, earlier?
[97:13.22]Like, how long ago?
[97:15.17]I'm just wondering, like, do you sneeze?
[97:18.33]Yeah.
[97:19.69]Oh, okay, cool.
[97:20.57]That's good.
[97:21.03]It's good for your body.
[97:22.33]Bless you, bro.
[97:22.85]Let's go this way.
[97:24.07]We could take you guys to the campfire.
[97:25.79]I could use a refill.
[97:37.44]Okay, fellas.
[97:38.94]Let's do it.
[97:42.02]Okay, this is the opposite direction.
[97:44.24]But there's also a campfire here.
[97:46.40]We can recharge.
[97:47.46]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[97:50.03]Why'd you say that like that, Ster?
[97:51.33]Oh, this is the one we started at.
[97:52.97]He's got to recharge.
[97:53.93]Dude, Ster is pissed and wants to play Hemlock.
[97:57.69]Hemlock.
[97:59.69]I want to play Path of Exile 1 tomorrow.
[98:03.19]Okay.
[98:08.21]No, not with you.
[98:09.90]Alright, give me one more minute.
[98:12.14]One more minute.
[98:14.66]Wow.
[98:15.52]Of what?
[98:19.32]We rested up.
[98:20.02]We're all breasted.
[98:21.22]Okay, I'm going to go this way.
[98:25.52]No.
[98:32.16]I like this music.
[98:32.96]It's kind of like Turok meets Perfect Dark.
[98:37.16]Unless, maybe my references are a little old, but.
[98:41.44]Oh, okay.
[98:42.72]No.
[98:44.48]Well, now we have this music.

[99:21.01]That's a good one.
[99:22.11]You know, that's a cool one, I could say.
[99:24.73]That's a cool one.
[99:25.59]You get bonus points for that.
[99:26.87]Yeah.
[99:29.41]What's the one with the... Oh, the stealth guy?
[99:34.83]Sly guy?
[99:37.84]Sly Cooper?
[99:39.26]Metal Gear Solid?
[99:39.82]Was that on PS1 or no?
[99:41.14]Yeah, Sly Cooper on PS2.
[99:42.38]Oh.

[99:46.58]Yeah, that guy's good.
[99:47.48]No.
[99:49.40]Uh... How about Charlie's Angels?
[99:52.56]Wait, what?
[99:54.06]Charlie's Angels went hard.
[99:55.24]Did it?
[99:56.56]What else?
[99:57.54]Monkey Ball.
[99:59.35]Monkey Ball's a good one.
[100:00.29]I'm a big fan of Monkey Ball.
[100:01.65]Yeah.
[100:01.91]That's good.
[100:07.30]This dude's just naming every game.
[100:12.15]I told somebody like five and a half years ago that I was going to play Sly Cooper on my next stream and I just never did.
[100:20.11]He asked for like two years and I was just like, oh yeah, man, of course.
[100:25.43]I just probably never will ever.
[100:27.85]For that one guy, yeah.
[100:31.43]I hope one day for his sake you do.
[100:33.31]He's been waiting.
[100:35.52]he made it you know a burner account in your chat just to say that and he's you know I'm wait I'm he's waiting it's true hello yo did you get this treasure chest yeah that's where we dropped down before yeah we dropped down here let's go down here and this will take us to
[101:04.80]more treasure and stuff do you guys have a one guy or do you ban them like if there's a one guy that asks for like an obscure thing each time or do you just get rid of them uh there's there's someone who does that as a joke you just I haven't gotten rid of them um I I just ignore every single person I just don't listen to anyone um I indulged them and they became one of the main community members
[101:33.87]Oh, I hate that.
[101:34.67]I hate that.
[101:41.51]Jerma, I'm going to summon my own army of spiders to help us.
[101:44.33]Sorry, I got tornadoed.
[101:48.33]Where are you guys?
[101:49.01]Oh, on top.
[101:50.31]Yeah, I jumped down here because I don't think we can get up there.
[101:53.04]Yeah, good luck.
[101:55.26]There's a treasure chest here that Jerma didn't get.
[101:57.12]This move stinks.
[102:03.90]Yeah, there's a guy asking for this game called Graph War in every single way he can possible.
[102:10.43]Graph War?
[102:11.25]Is it like math?
[102:15.35]Just look at it.
[102:15.99]Yeah, it's literally a math game.
[102:17.89]Like, it's just like the most hardest math.
[102:20.83]1v1 math.
[102:21.73]It's just weird.
[102:22.59]Trevor, did you get the treasure chest?
[102:27.30]Uh... Oh, no.
[102:29.92]I did.
[102:30.32]Okay, good.
[102:30.98]Alright, good, good.
[102:38.39]Someone is asking me to play Red Alert 2.
[102:42.59]It's Red Alert 1, actually, and it was me.
[102:47.05]Other way, Vinny.
[102:49.69]You can name drop me.
[102:50.67]It's fine.
[102:51.71]No, someone keeps telling me to play Hammer Watch 2.
[102:54.07]I'm never going to do it.
[102:55.62]Oh, dude, I've heard of that game.
[102:56.66]Is that the game where you have the little on the screen and you shoot stuff out?
[103:00.88]You are on the screen.
[103:02.50]I said little guy on the screen.
[103:03.72]I like games when you're on the screen.
[103:06.08]I've heard it's very good.
[103:10.45]One of my mods said it was genuinely excellent, and I've been so excited to play it.
[103:14.63]And then I just keep posting games like Flyknight.
[103:20.11]I don't got a problem with Flyknight.
[103:22.72]Flyknight's good.
[103:24.34]I played Soldat.
[103:25.62]I made a lot of maps in Soldat.
[103:28.10]Wait, really?
[103:28.60]Me too.
[103:29.00]Wait, actually?
[103:31.06]Yeah, for real.
[103:32.00]We have a deep, dark connection here.
[103:35.15]There was like another game like sold that was like a with the grapples and digging Liero Liero, that's what I was thinking Liero was so hard Little fighter 2 Loved Liero.
[103:50.69]I didn't know little fighter, but the arrow I played a lot of Little fighter 2 I'd make my own sprites.
[103:55.82]I would rip Mario sprites and just make them in characters That was the shit
[104:02.89]man yeah I mean it was it was there was some fun in like the early days of just finding a free game that you could play forever the frog break oh my god look at this we could do a pvp tournament if we turned off the friendly fire I didn't make maps in soldat I lied
[104:26.17]What?
[104:27.23]You said that in the saddest way.
[104:29.55]Really?
[104:29.97]I thought we were connecting.
[104:32.43]He just didn't want to get caught.
[104:33.39]Why would you say that?
[104:35.39]Wait, hold on.
[104:37.29]Why is Vinny lying about this random factoid?
[104:41.19]Which one?
[104:42.65]You didn't make maps in Soldat?
[104:44.11]Why did you say it?
[104:45.35]It wasn't Soldat.
[104:46.36]I played Soldat.
[104:49.18]This isn't a bit.
[104:50.34]The game was actually called Meteor.
[104:52.77]and it's a top-down game where you can make your own maps.
[104:55.93]I found a picture of it on Google, so it is real.
[104:58.85]I didn't make it up.
[105:00.24]And yeah, you make your own maps and you shoot.
[105:03.10]Totally different game, sorry.
[105:05.52]Okay.
[105:05.64]Dude, there was this really, really old game on the... Oh my God, I can't remember the system.
[105:13.65]Oh my God.
[105:15.19]What was the... I'm talking to people in a senior's home.
[105:18.87]Yeah, we're old.
[105:20.09]We're old.
[105:20.69]I don't care.
[105:21.71]What's the other SNES?
[105:23.33]After N64.
[105:24.97]N64, SNES, NES.
[105:26.95]No, the competitor.
[105:28.71]SEGA Genesis.
[105:30.29]Yeah, the SEGA.
[105:31.37]There's a weird game on the SEGA that's super... You make your own scenes from other games.
[105:37.25]They give you sprites.
[105:39.50]It was so weird.
[105:41.10]I think it was like a Mario Paint their own.
[105:45.70]Like they made their own Mario Paint.
[105:50.80]Yeah.
[105:52.08]No.
[105:52.50]Dude, no.
[105:53.32]Someone will know what I'm saying.
[105:56.38]They made their own Mario Paint, like the SEGA version.
[105:58.45]It was so crazy.
[106:00.39]wacky worlds yes okay it's apparently wacky worlds dude it was I don't know why I would have enjoyed that I think no I unlocked someone's childhood for real worlds yeah no I looked it up in a video I was like oh my God my dream is real like that's that was actually real like I never thought it was real
[106:26.23]You guys want to play Actraiser?
[106:28.51]Oh, God, Jerome.
[106:29.63]Yeah, I had that.
[106:31.09]You know what?
[106:31.53]No, I didn't have it.
[106:32.69]I lied.
[106:33.29]Go ahead.
[106:35.71]You're just lying today.
[106:38.07]You made your own maps.
[106:40.09]Yeah, I would edit it.
[106:40.95]Love that game.
[106:44.25]That mind sickness.
[106:46.31]But I played it.
[106:46.99]I liked it.
[106:47.43]It was RTS, and it was also a side-scroller.
[106:50.09]Actraiser 2 did away with the RTS, and it was not as good.
[106:54.55]I've never really played it.
[106:57.64]Okay.
[106:58.76]I heard very good things about it, though.
[107:01.64]And that was also with Genesis.
[107:02.48]Yeah, I've never even heard of it.
[107:04.76]Super Nintendo.
[107:05.64]SNES, yeah.
[107:13.17]Yeah.
[107:14.15]Smash.
[107:14.61]Yeah, I like that one.
[107:17.65]This weapon slows ill.
[107:24.28]Well, it's meant for fighting frogs.
[107:28.62]Yeah, I kind of had to stop using it.
[107:30.00]It was kind of unwieldy.
[107:34.58]Which means non-wieldy.
[107:41.86]Explain how you are not lying.
[107:43.44]You're getting your memories confused with pirate nipple.
[107:48.67]So, can I tell you guys a quick thing that happened like a couple weeks ago that made me feel like a crazy person?
[107:53.57]I don't trust you anymore.
[107:54.37]Yeah, please.
[107:55.69]I was playing Donkey Kong 64.
[107:56.73]I streamed it with a patch to make it better.
[108:01.08]And I was telling my chat, I was so happy.
[108:03.24]I was like, guys, I made a guide for Donkey Kong 64.
[108:05.44]It was a mini game guide.
[108:07.40]And I was so proud of it.
[108:08.76]I was like, you know, I wrote it up and I was a big fan.
[108:12.40]And then I found the paper.
[108:14.62]I printed it out.
[108:15.76]I found it.
[108:16.80]And I was reading it and showed pictures of it to the chat, and they Googled it, and they were like, Vinny, this is not your guide unless you went by Pirate Nipple.
[108:29.65]So that was your name?
[108:31.21]No, it wasn't.
[108:32.41]Someone named PirateNipple wrote the guide to Donkey Kong 64, and I either... I wrote a beginning and an end.
[108:39.38]You thought you did it.
[108:41.22]I thought I wrote the guide.
[108:44.18]So now there's this thing where it's like, I don't know what actually happened in my life or PirateNipple's life.
[108:49.76]Like, I just don't know.
[108:50.55]So he played Soldat.
[108:52.57]He played and made maps in it, yeah.
[108:57.35]that name checks out for that game I feel like we have not been in any real danger this entire game because we all have each other's backs I think we're we have like a force multiplier of four yeah it doesn't scale well I got a bunch of in my inventory hold on game is easy poke has died a few times yeah
[109:28.13]Yeah.
[109:29.65]Is PirateNipple an actual person?
[109:30.97]Because I used to play WoW with him in 2009.
[109:34.23]It might, listen, he had a guide.
[109:36.65]Apparently someone else wrote that guide.
[109:38.19]We found out later.
[109:39.19]But like, I most, I probably didn't write it.
[109:41.77]But I thought I did.
[109:42.51]I don't know.
[109:43.09]It's confusing.
[109:44.21]The other option, listen, the other thing that could have happened is I wrote the guide, I uploaded it, and someone stole it from me.
[109:49.49]But I give that a 5% chance.
[109:52.51]That's very unlikely.
[109:53.69]You know, PirateNipple stole your shit.
[109:56.88]Thanks, man.
[109:58.04]Appreciate that.
[110:00.90]This guy wants to kill Luna Moth instead of us.
[110:03.38]Wait, Pyro Nipple wants to join the call.
[110:07.04]Get him in?
[110:08.08]Get him in.
[110:09.26]What does he sound like, I wonder?
[110:11.94]He apparently made a Doom map as well.
[110:14.29]You blocked him.
[110:14.83]Good, good.
[110:15.91]Yeah, we learned a lot about this guy, but so little.
[110:18.25]It was a weird time, but yeah.
[110:22.33]New enemy type?
[110:22.87]What's this?
[110:23.75]Oh, a fish.
[110:27.57]Reinforcements.
[110:30.55]Come on.
[110:31.47]Oh.
[110:33.92]We're going together.
[110:34.64]Today you earn your knighthood.
[110:41.28]Oh, these guys might need to get hit by spells.
[110:43.12]Oh, you might be right.
[110:49.93]Wait, the tornado does pretty good damage.
[110:52.47]It's so loud.
[110:53.29]It kind of hurts.
[110:54.97]Hey, guys.
[110:57.40]Vacuum cleaner.
[110:59.80]That green spear does spell damage.
[111:02.28]It'll be good.
[111:08.61]Watch out.
[111:09.17]The blood.
[111:10.51]Rusty sword.
[111:20.72]You... Okay.
[111:22.06]I just jumped and got stuck on somebody and then you started doing that and I thought everything just crashed.
[111:27.95]Sorry, I didn't realize that was gonna repeat that many times.
[111:31.07]I just wanted it to repeat once.
[111:32.35]Uh, sorry about that.
[111:38.84]I can't wait to fight the next boss.
[111:40.48]I'm gonna fuckin' smash his head in.
[112:05.71]like when you think your voice activity uh level your the compressor is high enough so if you do if you fart like that it's not going to get picked up on the mic but it kind of still does I've been there before oh he dropped something that guy dropped armor chat I promise you that's not the real pirate nipple in chat it's someone who made that name just now
[112:26.90]That was one of those farts that it sounded like you thought it was going to be air coming out, but nope, you were so wrong.
[112:33.10]Who perpetrated that fart?
[112:36.00]Pirate nipple just made it too long.
[112:47.63]Nice.
[112:49.49]Should I mention the pirate nipple allegations or no?
[112:53.21]I'm going to call Ster about them later.
[112:56.01]I'm going to hear about this.
[112:57.88]Hours.
[112:58.30]We're going to be on the phone.

[116:55.24]You should just lie about the money.
[116:56.14]Pretty much.
[116:57.36]What do you mean?
[116:58.46]You should just say, like, a million dollar prize.
[117:04.08]And we just don't care.
[117:04.86]A million dollars.
[117:10.72]I'll throw in... For prize money, I'll put up, like, 25 bucks.
[117:18.04]We can crowdsource the prize money.
[117:19.66]I'll put a couple hundred thousand, you know?
[117:25.88]You get this old fucking gross t-shirt that I have in my closet and like 80 bucks.
[117:31.18]I'm in.
[117:32.78]Yeah, someone actually probably would want that.
[117:34.46]Oh yeah, fuck that.
[117:35.12]Never mind.
[117:35.94]You're getting a clean t-shirt off the rack.
[117:38.49]Right, exactly.
[117:39.23]There you go.
[117:41.35]Guys, did you get the Katar and the leech ring?

[118:12.95]That was not you that pinged.
[118:15.47]Here, I'll ping.
[118:16.00]How do you ping?
[118:16.64]Oh, here's a ping.
[118:18.16]Yeah.
[118:18.68]Sorry, Vinny.
[118:19.24]I thought that... No, you're good.
[118:21.02]You're good.
[118:21.42]That was your ping.
[118:22.84]You'll enjoy that.
[118:23.68]That seems cool.
[118:25.04]Nice.
[118:29.12]Oh, the guitar is a doubler.
[118:32.42]Bells are stronger.
[118:35.24]These look cool.
[118:37.21]So you know what everybody should be drinking?
[118:38.37]I'm gonna guess peppermint tea.
[118:43.77]No, it was moonshine again.
[118:48.59]Oh.
[118:49.71]Sorry.
[118:49.97]I had, like, you know, they had, like, fake moonshine that they sold at the liquor store.
[118:54.78]And, uh, I don't, like, isn't moonshine supposed to be, like, super, super strong?
[119:01.80]Like, really, like, knock you out?
[119:04.57]Yeah.
[119:04.73]Yeah.
[119:06.36]Yeah, this wasn't that.
[119:08.35]I've never had real moonshine.
[119:09.53]Where do you get yours from?
[119:10.39]A bathtub.
[119:15.15]I was offered some, actually, and I said no thank you.
[119:19.93]Moonshine is, depending on, it's good if you drink it, like if it's made correctly.
[119:28.96]I've had it a few times before.
[119:29.88]It's good.
[119:32.14]And the one I tried had cherries in it, and it just tasted, it was like just burning.
[119:36.97]It just tastes like burning.
[119:40.51]I don't think alcohol has ever tasted good to me.
[119:43.33]Ever.
[119:45.53]Yeah, alcohol kind of sucks.
[119:49.53]Do you like coffee?
[119:50.61]Poke?

[120:42.59]Yeah, I was talking to this guy, and he was, like, doling out story that we're not actually paying attention to.
[120:48.91]This is a boss.
[120:50.05]This looks like a boss, guys.
[120:51.35]I'm excited.
[120:51.91]I want to fight this boss.
[120:52.95]Let's fight this boss.
[120:55.72]I want them to die.
[120:56.56]Ben Franklin had a milk punch?
[120:59.16]What if we just all spammed plants in front of it?
[121:01.82]I bet that would work.
[121:05.80]Is there a cutscene going on or something?
[121:08.41]Yeah, I'm locked.
[121:09.65]Go on, my dear squire.
[121:10.95]Sway me.
[121:12.41]That's what they said.
[121:13.34]Whoa, he's up here right now.
[121:14.96]I love how he has a portrait, too.
[121:16.44]We get to see his bullshit.
[121:19.76]Oh, he's moving fast.
[121:24.42]We can assuage him.
[121:27.59]I used to think the word assuage was actually pronounced sausage.
[121:32.07]Like sausage.
[121:36.23]I don't even know what assuage is.
[121:37.95]Neither do I. I just said it before to sound smart.
[121:40.87]I don't think I know what it means.
[121:44.39]Have I done a point of damage to this boss?
[121:51.39]I can't move.
[121:52.01]It means to reassure.
[121:55.39]Ah, there you go.
[121:56.78]Assuage.
[121:57.26]Oh no.
[121:58.54]Can someone assuage Vinny?
[121:59.82]No, no, no.
[122:01.14]I got this.
[122:01.62]I got this.
[122:02.00]I'm alive.
[122:02.54]I'm good.
[122:03.10]I'm assuage.
[122:03.92]Can we parry this guy?
[122:14.51]Oh my god.
[122:15.13]Ow.
[122:15.25]I'm down.
[122:24.82]I'll get Jerk.
[122:27.16]Thank you.
[122:28.26]But he already admitted to not hitting the boss.
[122:31.50]I mean, there's a chance that could change.
[122:34.79]I'm using these little slicers.
[122:36.55]Let me hold on.
[122:39.01]I'm using the extension that shows everyone's DPS, and I gotta say...
[122:43.77]Oh, dude, you wish you had details up when I was in fucking WoW on my hunter.
[122:47.72]You wish.
[122:49.76]Oh, I had a hunter too, Jerma.
[122:53.60]I had a warrior as well, and I failed miserably at that role.
[122:56.48]Like, so bad.
[122:57.80]Dude, you wish my combat role could be even studied.
[123:01.96]I wish it could be studied?
[123:13.74]I don't think the spooders do anything.
[123:15.20]Yeah, I'm something about spiders and things.
[123:18.02]On Hardcore WoW?
[123:18.66]100%.
[123:23.28]Dude, I would have gone Shadow Priest and it would have just been mind-flaying.
[123:27.00]I would have given mind sickness to everybody fucking coming near me.
[123:32.44]Okay, so next year, the next Only Things, you guys are all playing, right?
[123:37.38]Dude, I might play, like, tomorrow.
[123:39.10]I'm...
[123:43.26]noob you should you should Ster's gonna be playing path of exile one tomorrow yeah dude we could all pick something to play though this doesn't this sound fun tank heal dps we could have a fifth horseman we could have a sixth horseman for all of that we can replace for the wow one you can definitely get it like a fourth other horseman
[124:07.42]Isn't that, like, 700 hours of commitment?
[124:10.38]I'm almost dead.
[124:11.08]Yes.
[124:12.19]I got, like, alright, the most I got is three hours.
[124:14.81]I give you three.
[124:16.39]Three hours total?
[124:18.21]Of World of Warcraft.
[124:19.13]Yeah, I give you three.
[124:20.01]That's reading the quest text in Durotar.
[124:21.87]You ain't gonna even get out of the front door.
[124:24.53]I know.
[124:25.27]My favorite part of WoW was exploring and looking at, like, landscapes.
[124:29.01]So, yeah.
[124:33.07]I wish you well, though.
[124:34.11]But, you know, down for command and conquer.
[124:38.77]He reads quest text.
[124:40.79]I don't.
[124:41.19]I look when the arrow points in the direction, I go there.
[124:47.01]You would love the leveling add-on everyone uses.
[124:51.02]It looks so... What is it?
[124:52.32]It looks so good.
[124:53.64]It's like... It's called real XP and you just follow an arrow and it does everything for you.
[124:59.28]I'm dead.
[124:59.68]Damn it.
[125:02.02]I suck.
[125:02.60]Well, so is this guy.
[125:06.63]Not enough flasks to revive.
[125:10.34]Heal me!
[125:11.08]Heal me!
[125:12.56]Oh no, I don't have any flasks either.
[125:15.80]Yay!
[125:19.30]Sterp Throat has gotten him up.
[125:23.96]Seven deadly sins?
[125:27.26]Wait, we're going to have to go from the four horsemen to the seven deadly sins if we have more people.
[125:32.80]No, it would be the seven heavenly virtues.
[125:35.84]Wow.
[125:39.16]Temperance.
[125:39.60]Oh my god, dude.
[125:40.34]Chastity.
[125:41.12]Charity.
[125:42.43]The whole set?
[125:43.63]Togetherness.
[125:49.35]I'm, uh, very strong.
[125:53.29]Are you just, like, doing Captain Planet now?
[125:55.69]No, those are the seven virtues.
[125:57.72]Oh, okay, got it.
[126:01.60]Ooh, are we all gonna put this on?
[126:05.58]How do we go from being horsemen of the apocalypse to the virtues?
[126:11.90]Change of heart?
[126:13.80]Hey, we're... We can expand.
[126:17.28]Okay, if we were part of the Seven Deadly Sins, which one are you?
[126:32.07]Gluttony.
[126:33.79]Greed.
[126:37.13]I don't know.
[126:38.47]I'm definitely not greed.
[126:40.29]I'm definitely not
[126:42.27]lust maybe sloth I mean I am sitting in a lazy boy right now you guys ever see those like uh massage chairs those big ones you can put your whole body in yeah they're good those things sound awesome fried mine would be loud is that one
[127:10.98]Seven deadly sins.
[127:12.36]I think so.
[127:13.12]Have you guys eaten any of your fish, by the way?
[127:16.24]I don't have a fish.
[127:17.58]No?
[127:19.68]How do you eat the fish?
[127:21.74]Okay, you can eat the fish in your inventory, and it gives you... It benefits, I guess.
[127:27.67]Can I have one?
[127:29.01]Here.
[127:30.27]Now, the question is, are we still doing this one, or you guys want to look into what are we doing?
[127:37.59]I'm down for whatever.
[127:38.37]I'm just hanging out.
[127:40.50]We can keep going here.
[127:41.42]We got Hammer Watch.
[127:42.74]We've got... I would say Command and Conquer Red Alert.
[127:47.42]We should probably... That's probably going to be a doozy.
[127:51.10]We're going to need to test that, you think?
[127:52.76]I don't think we could even... We need to figure that out.
[127:56.07]Yeah, that wouldn't be like figure out live on stream, right?
[127:59.49]Yeah, probably dangerous.
[128:03.21]But I think Hammer Watch could be a good idea.
[128:04.91]I'm down.
[128:06.47]I'd play Hammer Watch.
[128:07.45]We can fulfill Stirra's ultimate wish.
[128:10.69]right now um I like this game I'm down to keep going I'm having a really good time but I'm not ready I like the game too I would pivot the hammer watch just to see what it's all about someone said y'all are three-fourths done with the game is that true would this be like the last zone then I believe it though that's
[128:36.66]This is the last zone.
[128:37.98]I've heard it is very short.
[128:39.08]Let's do it.
[128:40.52]Yeah, the Red Alert remaster.
[128:43.30]They re-released it, so I'm sure all the... Probably would be easy to connect to each other.
[128:48.60]Wait, a remaster came out?
[128:50.18]I just bought like a bundle set of all the games.
[128:53.84]Yeah, there's a remaster.
[128:57.32]Like two years ago.
[128:58.34]It was really good.
[128:59.30]Two, three years ago.
[129:01.19]Oh my God.
[129:02.41]Wait, I'm excited.
[129:03.13]You can play it.
[129:03.57]I think you can play it in the old graphics too, can't you?
[129:08.18]Wait, that's actually... You can play in the old graphics, yeah.
[129:11.45]Yeah, it's great.
[129:11.83]Does it have, like, online play that, like, works?
[129:13.31]I think so.
[129:15.23]I haven't tested it, but I believe so.
[129:24.48]Yeah, the game, I mean, just hanging out with the boys, you know what I mean?
[129:27.24]It doesn't matter what we're playing.
[129:28.58]We play this, we play Command & Conquer, we play whatever.
[129:33.34]Vinny's dead.
[129:35.28]Mm-hmm.
[129:37.15]he's really just hung it up I saw I saw a treasure chest and I tried to get it and I jumped into a pit you um I don't know where you are taking all this heavy armor off I don't think you can get me I think I'm like dead dead unless you do a bonfire that's like how badly you wanted to play hammer watcher oh and we're gonna yawn too that's back to back
[130:06.40]No, that was not related to the game.
[130:08.86]No, it's not the game.
[130:13.86]You know what?
[130:14.53]I'm going to say it right now.
[130:15.77]I'm going back to the bonfire.
[130:17.01]I dislike that people connect yawning to disliking the situation.
[130:23.95]Does that make sense?
[130:24.87]Yeah, that's kind of true.
[130:25.79]Sometimes you just kind of have to.
[130:27.43]Yeah, like I'm scared to yawn because I think I'm bored.
[130:30.83]Well, I think it means that your head's cold in reality or something.
[130:37.56]thank you you got me back that's amazing stretch a little you know so guys there is a secret treasure chest somewhere around here and I was like I I tried to get it I wasn't you know what I mean I was trying your head's hot your head is hot vinny were you playing that trick shot the game that the game that's hard

[131:04.92]Oh, man.
[131:05.76]Jerma, it is definitely a you experience, but knowing you, you will be playing it for like six, seven hours.
[131:13.76]It's very frustrating.
[131:16.56]But, you know, I made four trick shots.
[131:19.73]But the one I really wanted to do was three coins and three bottle caps in a row.
[131:24.34]And it just broke me.
[131:26.94]No, that was impossible.
[131:27.46]Yeah, you should play it.
[131:29.20]That was impossible.
[131:30.32]I think that was impossible.
[131:31.82]Northernlion got it today.
[131:33.06]It took him 17 hours total.
[131:35.22]Did he get it?
[131:35.78]No way.
[131:36.82]He didn't do it just today.
[131:37.92]He did it like that 17 total total.
[131:39.78]But yeah, he did it.
[131:40.56]He got it.
[131:41.86]Wait, that's actually crazy.
[131:43.04]16,000 tries, according to the chat.
[131:46.74]It's just hard.
[131:47.62]That's crazy.
[131:48.02]So, Poke, how many did you get?
[131:49.36]Did you get a bunch of them?
[131:50.66]I got a bunch, yeah.

[131:55.00]It saves the videos at the end.
[131:56.82]Switch is going to probably take those from you.
[132:01.58]Jerma, look over here, over here.
[132:05.23]Yeah, it was a dumb joke.
[132:06.77]I get it.
[132:07.75]I'm sorry.
[132:09.35]I was muted and laughed.
[132:11.77]You see that treasure chest over there?
[132:14.71]Where?

[133:15.37]You get more speed if you don't have armor on, I believe.
[133:18.23]I think that's true.
[133:18.67]Or your weapon out as well if you switch to knives.
[133:21.45]Alright, try it.

[135:44.90]uh it's covering your whole body too oh my god how do you even see out of this thing reminds me of um what was it Counter-Strike that you could walk around with the was it the riot shield the riot shield yeah that's the only way I could play that game I think they got rid of that in cs2 if I'm not mistaken I would just hide beneath it crouch and just try to see any part of the game instead of walking out the door and dying by a headshot
[136:14.50]yeah I that was one I was addicted to so like the same you were addicted to uh TF2 I was playing TF2 as well whoa bad oh and you're gone gone okay uh be careful I don't even know if we should be doing this but uh here we are you know I I loved gun game house knives was my favorite thing ever I don't think you can make that
[136:43.25]guys I died do we all die wow alright I'm gonna find the next bonfire uh the defeated sound of your voice gun game was really cool by the way I played a lot of that too I want a full game on gun game I just want the game mode to be gun game I want the actual game itself to be gun game I think
[137:12.13]There's like Call of Duty games that implemented that as like a game mode.
[137:17.87]It's a never-ending gun game.
[137:20.31]Yes, exactly.
[137:21.17]Like a giant BR, except there's like a hundred weapons to go through.
[137:26.28]And the end game gun is like a planet destroyer.
[137:28.82]Yeah, like a laser beam.
[137:30.46]It just never ends.
[137:31.28]That'd be cool.
[137:32.02]Oh, that'd be, yeah.
[137:32.92]That'd be fun.
[137:36.16]Are you guys just looking at like a dead screen?
[137:39.44]Should I jump in the ocean?
[137:42.67]Yeah, I can't see shit.
[137:44.01]They don't let you spectate.
[137:47.27]Okay, I have no idea where I'm going.
[137:48.81]That would actually be a cool idea.
[137:52.07]You start from, like, pure primitive weapons, dicks, and you work your way up to a hundred weapon, thousand, a hundred million weapons.
[137:59.52]Yeah, so you might be fighting against somebody that has, like, a tree branch, and you have, like, a deagle.
[138:05.50]But if the guy with the tree branch kills the guy with the deagle, holy shit, that's a PogChamp moment on stream.
[138:11.12]Yeah, you jump up to that level, the Battle Royale.
[138:15.64]That would be awesome.
[138:17.34]Actually be sick.
[138:20.41]I'm back.
[138:24.35]Where are we supposed to go?
[138:25.23]Yeah, I don't know.
[138:26.41]I have no idea where we're going.
[138:27.85]This area is kind of confusing.
[138:31.12]We just need to walk in a straight line.
[138:35.50]If you could believe it.
[138:36.78]Jump on the water?
[138:38.58]no like continue going forward in a like a straight line oh jump in the water got it oh poke also you make sure you have to say this anytime you say something that's like a kind of a good idea make sure you legally protect yourself um if anybody makes this uh poking up got one-shotted I don't think the mushroom armor is good folks I've lost so many ideas
[139:04.00]What's the Jerma?
[139:04.60]How do you do it?
[139:05.14]7%.
[139:06.92]Whatever you... Hey, if somebody makes that, you make that game, and it was like, oh, the laser destroying thing that Jerma came up with.
[139:14.86]I would get 7% of this.
[139:16.00]So, you know, like, you got to make sure you protect yourself.
[139:22.48]Thank you.
[139:25.06]And of that 7% that I would get, I would obviously consider the co-developer like you, right?
[139:33.43]I wanna be in the like the credit like the title okay he's saying this because the candle got made it actually did what is the candle I don't know I'm trying to help you up the stairs is this like a sore spot Jerm do you but what is what is the candle uh it is a full game uh coming to Steam it's a whole thing did you you came up with a concept
[140:02.64]Yeah, also, how are you going to give me 7%, by the way?
[140:05.96]I am not kidding.
[140:09.16]Wait, what's the candle?
[140:11.42]Somebody actually made a version of a stupid game that I was saying they made it.
[140:16.32]Did they sell it?
[140:20.33]You better believe it.
[140:21.21]Whatever they sell, I'm getting 7% of it.
[140:26.87]I mean, I think you're shortchanging yourself with only 7%.
[140:31.44]Well, here's the deal.
[140:32.98]You, you have like 50 of these where you give the, the idea.
[140:38.62]And wow, what a great idea.
[140:39.94]Like poke, like you're just talking about that idea.
[140:42.37]7% for that idea.
[140:43.79]7% for this one.
[140:44.63]Eventually you get in 7% from like 50 different places.
[140:50.01]Well, you can take the percent because you brought up gun game.
[140:53.91]So you, so I would get 60% of the 7% that we'd be splitting.
[140:55.73]Okay.
[141:00.42]Well, actually, but hold on, though.
[141:02.78]You did talk about the, like, eventually becoming, like, a planet.
[141:08.44]And that's, I was just saying, gun games, so that might be worth another few percent, honestly.
[141:12.03]I just died.
[141:15.25]He kicked me.
[141:17.89]I'm trying to get rid of him.
[141:18.73]That's my percentage.
[141:21.33]Didn't we have a business last time?
[141:22.53]No, no one's getting any of my fucking ideas.
[141:25.41]Didn't we have a crazy idea last time?
[141:29.19]You goob.
[141:31.57]Guys, I don't think we're beating this level.
[141:35.56]Me and Ster will get this.
[141:37.30]The lava lamp.
[141:39.76]What was the lava lamp?
[141:42.76]Should we talk about it now?
[141:45.16]I think the lava lamp is a great idea.
[141:45.98]Say 7% first, and then we get it.
[141:51.03]we want to sell lava lamps all of us four of us all all of us we work together and sell lava lamps I'm actually down for that because I have an alien lava lamp that's really cool and I would I would totally do that it would be like yeah we just work together on it I got super into lava lamps I think they're awesome you can't see your screen at all
[142:13.21]I don't need to see my screen to talk about lava lamps.
[142:15.41]No, I'm talking about these.
[142:16.49]We got these punching cannonballs in your whole entire screen.
[142:19.57]You would have got them too if you walked into the room instead of kicking me.
[142:23.24]Dude, I think about this.
[142:25.76]Let's say you got a lava lamp.
[142:27.36]Let's say, Poke, you're a lava lamp.
[142:29.28]It is custom to you.
[142:31.28]And it's a couple different colors that you would pick and design it.
[142:34.14]Maybe you want some red glitter in there.
[142:36.86]It would be the Poke lava lamp.
[142:41.47]They'd be very different from each other.
[142:43.15]Different material, different, you know, bling on the outside.
[142:47.19]Users can make their own lava lamps by uploading an image and it simulates what it would look like glooping around.
[142:52.87]That'd be pretty sick too.
[142:55.72]Does that work?
[142:59.26]Cost of production would not be worth it.
[143:00.98]And we called them gloops.
[143:02.42]It would probably be insane to produce these.
[143:06.50]Yeah.
[143:07.72]well I mean if there's demand for it then you know you can mass produce and save money but it's just yeah that's it I think there's a massive demand for lava land should come back they were huge they're really nice they're really cool I don't know more potions these green bugs explode when you kill them fun fact
[143:35.48]What if it wasn't a lamp shape?
[143:39.19]What if it was a different shape?
[143:41.30]I feel like whatever lava goo in the liquid that floats around, whatever you would want to do.
[143:47.27]I think for production-wise, though, you'd probably have to be, you know, let's just say that we had four different lava lamps, I imagine it would be more cost-effective to make a shitload of one type.
[144:00.58]All four of them would look cool next to each other, though.
[144:02.56]Like, Jerma, you'd have, like, the purple one.
[144:04.58]The collector edition.
[144:05.52]I'd have, like, the green one.
[144:07.66]Yeah, but it's just four of us, and that's it.
[144:10.33]That'd be cool.
[144:11.41]And if we do the seven deadly sins or whatever, then we could get a couple extras in, but sure.
[144:16.31]Yeah, certificate of authenticity with each one.
[144:18.79]Oh, we did it!
[144:20.45]A high school photo of each of us.
[144:28.78]What even are my channel branding colors?
[144:31.14]Like purple, pink, blue, green?
[144:34.39]Kind of a little bit of everything, isn't it?
[144:39.32]Steel, pink, yeah.
[144:40.68]That'd be cool.
[144:43.90]Is it my armor that's making me slow?
[144:45.66]Yes.
[144:46.37]Oh, wait.
[144:48.77]Yes.
[144:50.39]Yes.
[144:52.25]Can't call them lava lamps.
[144:53.51]That's trademarked.
[144:54.27]You can call them slime lights, though.
[144:56.61]Wait, lava lamps are trademarked?
[144:58.93]That's weird.
[145:00.65]Did we just loop back around, guys?
[145:02.37]Yeah, we let the bridge lower the bridge, though.
[145:03.75]We lowered the bridge, though.
[145:06.25]Okay.
[145:07.79]This guy, you got your eyes closed.
[145:12.65]Eyes wide shut.
[145:15.11]The truth is in that film.
[145:17.69]Ooh, nice one, Ster.
[145:21.98]That's how you do it.
[145:22.78]That's how you do it.
[145:24.08]And you tell me you wouldn't be a good rogue in World of Warcraft?
[145:32.14]Okay, let us know what it is.
[145:40.04]I'm kind of afraid to do this.
[145:41.10]You go first.
[145:42.02]It is a cool looking sword.
[145:50.88]The snake slicer.
[145:51.92]Oh, I got to drop some of my stuff back off.
[145:54.38]We're going to get poked back, right?
[145:58.06]No.
[146:00.14]This is like the hard edge from Final Fantasy VII almost.
[146:02.80]There's like no sound.
[146:04.36]It's just pure.
[146:05.36]I'm just dead.
[146:07.08]You're just in silence.
[146:08.22]Yeah.
[146:10.20]I can't spectate.
[146:11.02]I'm glitched through a wall.
[146:13.61]Just take your time, guys.
[146:16.15]We'll probably have a bonfire here in a second, right?
[146:22.27]Bonfire!
[146:24.13]Dude, I missed Skrillex.
[146:25.54]The candle dev is in the chat.
[146:26.68]I'm trying to get in touch about your 7% for like a month.
[146:29.94]Oh, thank you.
[146:34.36]Yeah, it was knife party.
[146:35.30]I know.
[146:38.73]Oh, they're all back.
[146:41.50]You might have to put all the stuff you picked up away as well.
[146:46.28]I don't know.
[146:48.28]Yeah, put some of that stuff away.
[146:49.49]I know he's still making music.
[146:50.83]I'm just showing.
[146:55.89]If you don't get my humor, just ban him.
[146:57.29]Just ban everybody from here.
[147:01.87]Did you just, wait, did he just, wait, did he, hold on.
[147:06.27]Everybody freeze.
[147:07.19]We'll just, is that, never mind.
[147:09.21]Weapon, weapon.
[147:09.79]I thought I saw something.
[147:11.17]Okay, Jerma.
[147:11.77]Okay, because you don't have your clothes on anymore and you, an enemy just blew off and I thought it was one of you, but then I was like, wait, no, but you don't have, I was like, wait, who's that?
[147:21.14]And it's like, oh, that's Poke with no armor on.
[147:23.78]So do I go for the chest and die again or no?
[147:26.97]nah it's a sword it's a cool sword but I mean like starting mace this whole time well the starting mace has crush right damage type I believe that's correct so the the new sword has that as well so you could effectively replace it if you want but no shield I like shields alright buddy
[147:53.62]OH FISH!
[147:54.38]FISH!
[147:55.16]FISH!
[147:56.02]FISHES ARE CRAZY!

[148:09.85]There's nothing back there, Benny.

[149:40.81]Still funny.
[149:41.33]I like it.

[149:47.53]Oh.
[149:55.53]Oh, that's yeah, I would use that.
[149:59.25]You would, or are you going to?

[150:22.59]Wamp.
[150:32.39]Falling R1.
[150:34.35]That does a lot of damage.
[150:46.92]This looks cool, this area.
[150:50.12]And we might be getting close to the boss.
[150:51.55]Oh, enemies.
[150:56.61]I need stamina.
[151:00.95]I wish there was a stamina potion.
[151:03.64]watch out enemies foes wait it's just two arrows when I shoot adversaries it's a free kill over here um something this way knaves tangos fiends zeds

[152:08.35]I don't have mana?
[152:13.73]Yeah, this stuff is heavy.
[152:16.35]Maybe the shield is also weighing me down.
[152:19.13]Put on a parrying buckler.
[152:26.69]I'm using the ammo ring.
[152:30.86]Ooh, stamina.
[152:37.53]Dueling lands.
[152:38.91]Oh, dude.

[153:06.75]I'm going to use them.
[153:08.09]I want to use them.
[153:12.96]Not unless you also main them.
[153:15.38]My butt is getting stuck to the chair.
[153:24.35]A spirited gaming session.
[153:32.35]Are you naked right now?
[153:33.41]If I sat up right now, Poke, you would hear Velcro being turned off.
[153:38.98]Ster would hate that sound.
[153:42.30]What?
[153:45.15]He hates chair sound.
[153:49.19]I call him about it.
[153:50.23]We talk about it a lot.
[153:51.79]I knew it.
[153:52.27]Enemies.
[153:52.53]Enemies.
[153:52.99]Big enemies.
[153:53.51]Massive room.
[153:54.74]Big naturals.
[153:55.16]Enemies.
[153:55.58]Goated.
[153:55.84]What the fuck is going on?
[153:57.06]I thought that was one of you guys.
[154:19.28]How the hell?
[154:21.04]I'll rez.
[154:23.11]Does this bow shoot multiple arrows?
[154:25.67]It shoots like two arrows in one volley.
[154:27.59]I don't have any armor.
[154:36.61]I do.
[154:36.87]I know.
[154:37.45]I need armor.
[154:40.18]What?
[154:41.48]What the fuck?
[154:42.50]I can't get near him.
[154:46.46]Come on, folk.
[154:47.04]You can do it.
[154:55.12]I feel like I'm inside of one of your guys dreams and I'm watching like that I'm not playing a game right now we'll do your dream next week red alert red alert I think that'll happen one day we could connect to each other's dreams oh I wonder what he's dreaming
[155:24.00]Dream Sesh?
[155:25.64]I don't know if I would want that.
[155:27.79]Sometimes I have dreams where I'm getting fucking murdered with a chainsaw.
[155:32.05]What if it's fully controlled?
[155:33.57]Like a menu.
[155:35.55]I get a revive.
[155:36.27]Oh, we're all dead.
[155:38.35]I know.
[155:38.87]I'm trying to find the heal.
[155:41.09]Revive me and I have four flasks.
[155:44.43]I don't have any.
[155:45.29]Okay.
[155:48.01]What if dreaming is like Gary's mod though?
[155:51.96]I don't ever have in-between dreams.
[155:52.88]There's nothing even down here.
[155:54.10]There's nowhere to go.
[155:54.76]Like, Gmod, are you saying that you could just kind of... Yeah, if you could create and do whatever you wanted, yeah.
[156:03.49]Like, no clip and shit.
[156:04.81]But it's Gmod that's, like, glitching and, like, solar rays are, like, passing through your computer and just changing shit at random.
[156:10.94]Shit.
[156:13.11]my dreams don't have an in-between it's either something oh you're in the car and you're going oh that's the exit you get off on the highway oh okay cool that's the dream or like I like I've been like a shotgun blew my head off like in the dream like they do there's no in between what is that noise you guys hear that
[156:35.60]No one heard that sound.
[156:36.42]What is it?
[156:37.64]It's like a bass.
[156:38.54]Just repeat.
[156:41.06]Oh no.
[156:41.70]I opened up the thing.
[156:45.96]I've done it.
[156:47.54]Or like running away from a catastrophe.
[156:49.83]Like I've had dreams where it's like, oh my god, it's an earthquake and the whole world is earthquaking.
[156:56.03]Really?
[156:56.31]I just had like a dream where I was on a skateboard and I hit a tree and I wake up.
[157:02.09]I still have school dreams too those are really annoying like bart bart I like I like bart I don't know why oh why is it making me laugh so hard I'm like bart in the intro I don't know what the hell's going on you're on a skateboard but you just skateboard into a tree and you I'm like skateboarding I look away and I'm I hit a tree and I wake up every time oh
[157:25.14]Oh, that's- that does not sound fun, but that's- I'm 30, and I'm still doing- I'm on a fucking skateboard.
[157:30.20]Grown-grown-ass men.
[157:31.78]Like Mark Simpson.
[157:33.30]Grown-grown-ass men.
[157:33.76]That's amazing.
[157:35.42]Grown-grown-ass men.
[157:36.34]And- and wha- you keep getting- you keep smashing into a tree, too.
[157:41.27]Yeah.
[157:41.49]I opened up the thing where you have to jump on these boats and- and take the boat.
[157:44.83]Ah!
[157:45.05]Wow.
[157:45.23]Oh, shit.
[157:46.57]Cool, thanks, man.
[157:47.55]See ya.
[157:49.47]Oh, shit.
[157:50.53]Wowster.
[157:51.55]There's loot down that way.
[157:52.53]I- I- I'm- I'm gaming.
[157:57.62]Okay.
[157:58.50]Oh, seven.
[157:59.98]I have a dream I wrote down, Jerma, that I think you might like.
[158:03.34]Well, all of us.
[158:04.42]I don't know, but I'm going to direct it towards you because you brought up dreams.
[158:07.73]Tiny Pope with a gun.
[158:09.63]I was at an old friend's house, which was also a pool party.
[158:12.01]That evening, I was being mean to the Tiny Pope, which was John Paul II, but like four or five.
[158:18.34]Turns out he had a gun, so I restrain him and take his guns away and hold his arms.
[158:22.84]He eventually falls asleep.
[158:25.05]Hang on, let me get out of here.
[158:26.71]You said, tiny poke.
[158:28.73]Tiny poke.
[158:30.45]The next morning, the Pope wakes up and he's pissed and he's looking for his firearms.
[158:34.33]So I board a gyrocopter and get out of there.
[158:37.09]What?
[158:37.33]But he's got, wait, the propeller on the, okay, never mind.
[158:40.81]Yeah, so yeah, there's a tiny Pope with a gun and I board a gyrocopter.
[158:45.27]I have like either just mundane, crazy, like nothing dreams or like tiny Pope.
[158:50.63]But I write them down, and as a result, I get better.
[158:55.71]I used to write them down.
[158:56.59]I have one still there that I wrote down a long time ago.
[158:59.41]Later, dude.
[158:59.99]Alright.
[159:05.11]I might be getting dog aggro.
[159:07.33]Am I getting dog aggro?
[159:11.57]Yeah, Martin Scorsese turning into a stick bug was probably one of my top five dreams.
[159:15.86]That's a good one.
[159:21.24]yeah anyway you didn't push now yeah did you go outside that was a good one alright uh somebody protect me I need to uh I need to go outside I'll be right back me too
[160:05.53]It got real quiet without that guy.
[160:07.17]You know what I mean?
[160:08.95]No, he was the real lifeblood of the group.
[160:13.43]Well, I mean, when you only ask him about his dreams, then I guess only one person's going to talk about him.
[160:19.36]Ster, let me tell you about my dreams.
[160:21.42]Yeah.
[160:23.78]Hang on.
[160:25.26]I just got a bee.
[160:26.48]There's a bug here.
[160:27.76]Oh, did Poke also leave?
[160:33.55]Yeah.
[160:36.34]Jerma we entrusted us with his defense and poke was like nah alright we have to defend both of them um David lynch your dreams
[160:54.40]Not yet.
[160:55.22]This one's from October 7th.
[160:57.13]David Lynch dream in his den to watch a movie.
[161:00.49]Johnny the Goat poops and rams.
[161:03.19]Herbie, sweetie, sweetie.
[161:05.63]That's the dream.
[161:06.25]I wrote that down.
[161:07.67]What does any of that mean?
[161:09.05]I don't know.
[161:11.54]Herbie, like from the Fantastic Four?
[161:14.12]I don't know.
[161:14.64]He was just saying his goat was named Herbie.
[161:20.92]So...
[161:25.59]That's a good one.
[161:27.17]Oh, shit.
[161:27.85]I don't know.
[161:35.70]We were just kind of talking about stuff.
[161:42.27]Kojima teleports, stealing stuff with group.
[161:45.11]Gets caught in weird trap room.
[161:47.31]Tried to drink cola.
[161:48.67]Teleport out.
[161:49.81]Sad end.
[161:50.67]Conan.
[161:53.11]I wrote that down.
[161:53.79]Do any of these dreams not include, like, a celebrity?
[161:58.04]You know what?
[162:00.26]That's a good fucking point.
[162:02.60]That's a really good point.
[162:03.86]I don't think they don't.
[162:08.12]That's actually funny.
[162:09.22]It's true.
[162:11.71]That's actually funny.
[162:12.55]I laughed.
[162:14.01]I actually laughed at it too.
[162:16.61]Surprisingly funny.
[162:17.91]Wow.
[162:18.59]Wow.
[162:18.83]Yeah.
[162:18.99]Something Ster said.
[162:22.86]Um, here's one that doesn't involve a celebrity.
[162:27.06]Here's one last one.
[162:27.94]Okay.
[162:29.04]Costco was selling fake security uniforms for Costco.
[162:32.62]So I bought one and wore it the next time I went in and people were especially nice to me, including a guy who was a jerk last time.
[162:41.00]How did you dream the next time you went to Costco?
[162:44.78]I don't know.
[162:45.56]That's what I need to know.
[162:47.42]How long was your fucking dream?
[162:50.94]He woke up and he went to bed the next night and then he went back to Costco.
[162:57.41]I need part two here.
[162:58.35]In the dream he... Dwayne Johnson was like real nice to me.
[163:03.75]there's no celebrity in this one he asked the but but the guy who was a jerk to me asked me to return a wine bottle of his to a different section and grab some duck island wine which I didn't know was also a wine until I found it people said you know time skip and I believe that actually I actually believe that just happens in your dreams oh yeah I think so
[163:31.71]Time skipping in dreams?
[163:32.71]It sucks.
[163:34.11]I think if I found, like, you're reading this from a notebook, I would assume that you're some sort of CIA agent.
[163:40.44]Well... These are all missions you were on.
[163:42.30]Well, this is a dream I had.
[163:43.28]This is only for a Ster.
[163:44.72]None of you guys would care.
[163:45.52]Okay.
[163:46.66]I'll stop listening.
[163:47.28]But I was dreaming of a map on Soldat.
[163:49.84]I made a map on Soldat.
[163:51.72]None of you guys would care, but... Fuck.
[163:56.34]No, Pirate Nipple did that, remember.
[163:58.26]Oh yeah, shit.
[164:04.48]Alright, I'm back.
[164:05.20]I'm alive.
[164:05.92]I'm here.
[164:07.38]Yo.
[164:07.84]Was that your innie?
[164:09.78]Yeah, my belly button wrote that dream.
[164:11.67]I know what you're talking about.
[164:14.85]It's the hit television program, Severance, starring Adam Scott.
[164:17.79]I understand.
[164:18.59]Oh my god, I died.
[164:19.17]I'm going to start watching that.
[164:21.57]It's good.
[164:21.95]It's really good.
[164:23.00]I heard everyone saying it's good, so...
[164:26.60]yeah is that the TV show that everybody is going to watch like that's the show right yeah the show right now severance get on that I I heard it it's very good as well I I saw season one it was cool wait there's two there's more than one season the season two just started it's been like two years since the season one how many episodes in season one ten maybe ten eight to ten
[164:55.08]Good, good, good.
[164:56.76]Someone in my chat said, I always avoid watching shows that everyone watches.
[165:01.46]Well, I mean, that's a shame in a way.
[165:04.39]I get where you're coming from, but also you're going to probably miss out on some good stuff.
[165:10.39]You know, human beings, we're pack animals.
[165:17.31]That is valid, but they're missing out for real.
[165:19.01]What does that have to do with the show Severance, though, sir?
[165:20.85]Well, it has to do with avoiding things that other people do, or, you know, social creatures.
[165:26.47]He's trying to say that he's the alpha of this pack, which is debatable.
[165:31.34]I'm trying to say that it is not a point of shame to collaborate with individuals.
[165:39.10]Which, yeah, I agree.
[165:40.19]And share in their joy.
[165:41.79]In their joy, yes, I agree.
[165:44.63]This is what I heard.
[165:48.59]but if you want me to say it I will say I am the alpha or a pirate nipple maybe one way or another Jerma you should have seen how no one said anything when you left it for like a good two minutes it was just like dead air no it was dead air for two minutes three minutes no way no one said anything
[166:14.66]Yeah, you're the group leader, so there's just nothing to say.
[166:18.34]Like when you're out of the room, the simulation stops.
[166:24.51]No one said a word.
[166:28.29]This is kind of a... Oh, no.
[166:29.65]This reference is too far.
[166:31.83]No, I want to hear it.
[166:32.95]I forget the name of the show.
[166:36.22]It's the anime.
[166:38.16]The school girl.
[166:39.16]Boys, we got ourselves the final boss.
[166:41.76]But all I can think of is Hatsune Miku.
[166:43.54]Wait, wait, there's one more way over here.
[166:45.26]Oh, there is.
[166:46.82]Oh, wait, it's just fish.
[166:49.35]Fish.
[166:50.23]Let's do this.
[166:50.87]You guys want to give me one fish?
[166:52.59]Oh, wait, I have a fish.
[166:53.53]I should eat one.
[166:54.33]I dropped one earlier.
[166:54.89]Yeah, we should have one.
[166:55.77]We should eat one while we're doing the fight.
[167:00.04]Alright, let me get some gear on.
[167:02.30]Yeah, Haruhi Suzuma, which is Hatsune Miku's sister.
[167:07.22]sorry it's it's a hole what we're here to keep you happy because if you realize you're god don't tell me that man we're just talking about dreams I'm gonna have a dream tonight thank you when you're out of the room we all just sigh of relief like our duty it's spam jump
[167:28.31]Is everybody just putting up with me?
[167:30.29]Is that what I'm hearing?
[167:31.18]No, we're good.
[167:32.28]I'm going to mute for a second, though, and tell my chat something separate.
[167:35.44]We're scared of you.
[167:36.58]Just give me a second here.
[167:41.98]He muted.
[167:47.06]Yo, he actually just ended stream and left.
[167:49.80]And he's stuck us in the cinematic.
[167:51.45]Oh, he's stuck here?
[167:55.09]For real?
[167:55.81]Alright, I'm back.
[167:56.39]Sorry, I was just reading.
[167:57.45]I was talking to my chat privately.
[167:59.75]Alright.
[168:00.43]I will command the power of the cosmos.
[168:08.53]Uh-oh.
[168:10.47]Look out!
[168:12.97]Oh, that's a bad sound.
[168:15.95]Casting tornadoes!
[168:27.79]Oh, that is bad, folks.
[168:32.11]I just got killed.
[168:34.17]You got killed?
[168:34.75]Dog.
[168:36.57]Bro, the hammer does a lot of damage for her.
[168:39.22]Or this bonker thing.
[168:44.32]Spells.
[168:48.88]Alright.
[168:49.94]Get in.
[168:51.22]Vinny, are you ahead in the game?
[168:53.74]I'm trying, but I'm getting killed.
[168:56.07]I'll rez.
[168:56.75]I'll rez.
[168:57.43]You guys are living because I'm dying.
[169:02.47]That's why you're living, because I'm getting targeted by all these spells.
[169:05.55]Now help me save the alpha.
[169:06.58]Save the alpha.
[169:07.32]Save the alpha, please.
[169:08.22]Fuck.
[169:17.80]Oh, they're actually almost dead.
[169:24.24]Vinny, use your potions.
[169:25.88]So you don't die.
[169:32.40]Oh, come on.
[169:34.10]I'm saving them for you guys.
[169:35.34]So if you die, I could res you.
[169:37.04]Oh, come on.
[169:39.19]I'm healing.
[169:39.81]I'm healing.
[169:41.43]Oh, my God.
[169:48.93]Broke the shield.
[169:49.95]Now let us commence the kill.
[169:54.29]We did it.
[169:57.55]All that potential wasted.
[170:00.97]What else was I supposed to do?
[170:06.62]To just like fade to black and just like kick you out of the game now.
[170:10.64]Yeah, what does happen now?
[170:14.28]Play again, but now it's harder.
[170:19.29]Ooh, I like this run.
[170:27.73]Fly deity.
[170:29.04]With this, my wings will be mended and my brood finally safe.
[170:32.56]I couldn't be more proud of you.
[170:34.05]Once the rest of the wings are all returned to their respective begetters, the curse will be gone for good.
[170:40.37]Lunamoth needed our wings to reshape herself and fly to the moon where the moth deity lives to replace her and attain cosmic powers for her own ambitions.
[170:49.94]Unfortunately, this isn't over yet.
[170:52.48]The weapon she used...
[170:54.19]Alright, let's do it.
[170:55.57]It's in here.
[170:56.89]And end your quest?
[170:58.69]Are we falling?
[171:23.56]wow juniper really fucked up a whole world yeah do we speak the whole game um I'm refunding yeah that's awesome maybe there's more or maybe there will be updates I don't know do we like win do we win win I think I think we may I think we may have won one
[171:49.38]wish there was like maybe talents or like set bonuses something like that that was cool though I definitely I see the vision it's um I like the art style I like the environments I like the sound effects it was brilliantly crafted uh for uh you know as a 3d art yeah I would love to see more uh like you said poke I'd love to see like classes maybe yeah maybe a little harder I mean we did play with four people so I don't know
[172:18.28]uh yeah not bad for a six dollar game yeah that was that was great I I I'm being told there's more on the way if if the dev watches I feel like um bro that everyone should get their own loot like you know I think everyone getting the same thing kind of like I don't know unfun is that just me no I would I would like it to be a little more random yeah more randomness
[172:42.24]Maybe a good balance between stuff that everybody gets and stuff that one person gets.
[172:47.30]But this is, you know, obviously we're not making the game, but that's my preference.
[172:52.18]I agree with Poe.
[172:53.32]Yeah, and if you do any of that, Germany gets 7%.
[172:54.88]7%, all of us.
[172:58.69]I like the game.
[172:59.59]I like it.
[173:00.09]Really cool.
[173:01.95]There's a game I played.
[173:04.03]You guys all came up with that, and then you told me I get the money.
[173:06.67]Okay.
[173:08.78]Well, we know how you like treat us off stream, so.
[173:11.36]You know who actually gets the money?
[173:12.54]Pirate Nipple.
[173:13.98]Alright.
[173:15.50]So there's a game I played yesterday, by the way, called Tyrant's Realm.
[173:18.48]That's like a rogue, light, dark soul type game.
[173:22.06]It's the same thing.
[173:22.90]Good game, good concept, just limited.
[173:25.51]It's not quite there yet, but it's still really fun.
[173:28.55]So, I mean, there's a lot of good games like this for like five, ten bucks lately.
[173:31.85]Yeah, honestly, you can't go wrong for, you know, under ten dollars.
[173:34.89]That was really fun.
[173:36.99]Yeah, for sure.
[173:39.22]But do we want to do more things?
[173:43.38]I'm so down.
[173:45.20]What kind of things do we want to do?
[173:48.02]We do have Hammer Watch.
[173:51.78]Oh, by the way, Binding of Isaac, the co-op is pretty good on it now.
[173:56.65]Is it actually?
[173:57.95]They made it good?
[173:58.59]I tried it the other day, and the delay is way better.
[174:02.83]The delay is insanely better.
[174:04.17]Does that work with four people?
[174:06.01]Yep.
[174:07.42]Oh.
[174:08.52]Still no external ID.
[174:09.96]What does that mean, Dave?
[174:13.23]That sounds kind of cool.
[174:15.67]So we can do that one day.
[174:17.13]External item descriptions.
[174:18.82]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[174:21.13]Yeah, I know what you mean.
[174:21.97]So you won't know what the items do.
[174:24.03]It's up to you guys.
[174:24.61]I mean, I know, sir, you'd be down to play Hammer Watch probably more than the rest of us, but I like the idea of Hammer Watch.
[174:30.49]I want to see what it is.
[174:32.05]What does that mean?
[174:34.06]It sounds like you don't want to play Hammer Watch.
[174:36.76]I do.
[174:37.18]No, no.
[174:37.62]I totally want to play Hammer Watch.
[174:39.30]I just feel like... Wait, has it been five hours?
[174:43.90]Was it five hours?
[174:45.40]We've been playing Overwatch earlier.
[174:47.73]You guys were playing earlier?
[174:50.69]Yeah, we're playing Hammerwatch.
[174:52.79]Some of us have already been live for a while.
[174:55.45]It's fine.
[174:56.67]Whatever you guys want to do, I'm just here chilling.
[175:00.41]Yeah, I'm chilling.
[175:01.67]If you guys want to play something else or if you want to split the four horsemen into one single horseman streams, then whatever.
[175:07.67]I'm down for whatever.
[175:08.35]I'm down to do whatever.
[175:11.58]Ster, do you want to play Hammerwatch?
[175:13.48]Are you raring to go for that?
[175:15.86]I am, because I already streamed, I'm just a little tired.
[175:19.65]If the group is doing something, I'll do something.
[175:22.04]Yeah, I feel like we'd want to get into it.
[175:25.03]I feel like we could spend time on it, so I don't really have a... I opened up
