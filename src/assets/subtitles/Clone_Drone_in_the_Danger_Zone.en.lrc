[00:03.11]My mic was unplugged.
[00:04.37]And I was like, I just went off on like a great... I did like a Friday the 13th thing.
[00:08.91]Where I said, congratulations everybody, we made it through the night.
[00:12.87]Freddy, Jason, like I went off on a whole thing.
[00:14.67]And you missed it.
[00:15.39]Because I unplugged my mic.
[00:17.55]Because I was moving stuff around.
[00:19.13]But anyways.
[00:21.12]Happy... How's your Saturday going?
[00:23.24]Hope it's going well.
[00:27.24]Saturday stream.
[00:28.64]As we've tried to do recently here.
[00:32.40]Afternoon as well, well not, it's like late afternoon still hopefully friendly for some of you EU guys And we're gonna do something different today.
[00:39.83]We're gonna play a game And I just recently found out this game also has full Twitch extension support This is clone drones and clone drones in the danger zone Might need to talk about that title, but you know Game apparently is very fun
[01:03.18]This is not the thing, this is not the thing I was talking about.
[01:06.01]This is completely, this is just, no.
[01:07.47]This is not like the thing I was talking about a couple days ago.
[01:11.43]Hey guys, I got a huge, big, potential, fun thing.
[01:14.27]We're gonna play a game with Twitch support.
[01:16.21]No, that's not it.
[01:18.47]But this game actually, if you don't know what a Twitch extension is... Look, we ain't doing it yet.
[01:24.58]I wanna like learn the controls and play through some of the game first.
[01:27.82]But once we do the Twitch interaction...
[01:31.13]On the screen, on your screen, you're going to be able to interact with the stream.
[01:35.86]There's going to be like a little pop window that you can click on and do stuff with.
[01:39.48]Not just like in the chat.
[01:41.14]It's going to be on the screen, on your stream.
[01:43.24]You know what I mean?
[01:45.42]On your own screen, not on mine.
[01:50.41]I'm on mobile.
[01:51.15]Well, shit.
[01:55.13]So, this is clone drone in the danger zone.
[02:00.10]Game's apparently fun.
[02:00.86]It's an arena robot lightsaber fighter.
[02:04.64]I believe there's a multiplayer mode as well.
[02:06.26]This is what we're doing today, so, like... I guess there's a lot going on in this game.
[02:10.11]Currently in early access.
[02:12.11]It was requested heavily by at least one or two people in the Discord, so... Gonna give it a try.
[02:20.31]The multiplayer is only 1v1.
[02:21.64]Well, that's fine.
[02:22.58]It's like Dark Souls.
[02:25.16]So, let's switch to the game.
[02:26.34]Uh-huh, here it is.
[02:30.86]And there you go.
[02:32.66]Well, would you look at that?
[02:33.60]Clone drone in the danger zone.
[02:37.84]So, we've got, uh, story mode, endless mode, Twitch mode, challenges, multiplayer, and a level editor.
[02:47.25]And, uh, this is not my stream.
[02:48.89]That's not my stream.
[02:51.07]I have to, like, turn it on first.
[02:53.31]So, let's just find out what this game is.
[02:55.81]This is not Minecraft.
[02:57.23]This has nothing to do with Minecraft.
[02:58.55]It's a robot game.
[03:01.85]This is not, no, this is not, I didn't get paid to play this.
[03:04.28]This is a Discord, look into story mode.
[03:06.26]Alright, new game.
[03:09.80]The story is in development and will continue with chapter four in a future update.
[03:16.04]Let's just start on normal.
[03:18.10]Rhys.
[03:23.15]What?
[03:24.56]What the fuck is happening?
[03:26.98]What do I have to do?
[03:35.97]Okay, WASD, mouse 1 is attack.
[03:38.03]A and D plus mouse 1 is a horizontal attack.
[03:40.89]Blocking happens automatically when a sword collides.
[03:46.99]Okay, so it looks like it can go both ways.
[03:48.90]Does right click do anything?
[03:55.06]Okay, well, he's kind of kicking my ass.
[03:59.48]Ooh, I get it.
[04:00.28]Alright.
[04:01.80]So you got to cut their legs off.
[04:02.84]Oh, that's like the meme voice, right?
[04:04.06]Alright, hold on.
[04:05.12]Can I jump?
[04:05.42]Please return.
[04:05.84]Oh, I'm trying to kill these people.
[04:25.87]We must recycle.
[04:27.17]Okay.
[04:27.59]Well, at least they're teaching the kids something important.
[04:32.87]We pick it up.
[04:34.67]Yay.
[04:37.83]Fucking recycle your shit.
[04:39.15]Don't just throw your computer in the trash, guys.
[04:40.87]It's not good.
[04:42.53]In the next round, the human faces more than one sword robot.
[04:46.65]Yes.
[04:47.41]Who do you think will win?
[04:49.03]Analysis bot.
[04:50.25]Clearly it is better to have more robots.
[04:52.61]The robots will win.
[04:54.71]Fucking meme voice.
[04:56.41]Alright, upgrades available.
[04:57.59]We're just learning how to play.
[04:59.35]Current human, Pam Shepherd.
[05:02.19]Age 63, favorite color, grass.
[05:04.83]Power truck driver.
[05:06.15]That's not me though.
[05:10.88]Alright, E. Oh boy.
[05:14.80]Select upgrade, available one.
[05:16.32]We have to go in a tree here.
[05:17.64]This is Jeff.
[05:18.38]This is Jeff like Path of Exile.
[05:20.22]All you Path of Exile junkies, get in here.
[05:24.28]Fire sword, block arrows.
[05:27.24]We can do a kick.
[05:30.22]Create a clone that takes over when you die.
[05:32.18]Well, that's an extra life.
[05:33.04]Okay, so this is like a... Not only that, we've got ourselves a roguelike here.
[05:37.75]All you Dark Souls junkies, get on in here!
[05:40.09]I think Kim thinks I was just yelling up to have her come down here.
[05:46.71]I just heard like a bunch of steps.
[05:50.35]Unlocks the bow?
[05:51.57]Alright, I'm gonna say...
[05:53.65]Let's do Fire Sword.
[05:56.05]I probably just fucked it all up and everyone's probably going to make fun of me, but I don't care.
[06:02.11]Oh, cool.
[06:07.17]This is pretty cool.
[06:08.27]Alright, let's go.
[06:10.71]I reset the build?
[06:12.29]No, I got to play with a Fire Sword.
[06:14.55]Look, we're only fucking around for a few minutes.
[06:18.91]And by a few minutes, I might, like, beat the whole game.
[06:20.75]Alright.
[06:21.01]This is... They added stuff.
[06:23.29]And there are three people here.
[06:24.33]Alright.
[06:24.85]I can be ready.
[06:27.63]Nice.
[06:27.87]There's two.
[06:31.19]Now, can I block?
[06:32.07]If I... There we go.
[06:32.95]Alright.
[06:33.31]So, it actually is based on, like, where you are, where your sword is.
[06:38.32]Ooh.
[06:38.70]I just, like, lifted it up in the air and killed it.
[06:41.60]Okay.
[06:41.82]I feel like this is going to get wild.
[06:48.64]So that's it, here come the recyclers.
[06:50.10]We just keep going, right?
[06:52.23]Let's hear them talk again though.
[06:54.25]I'm not gonna kill them.
[06:55.27]I'm not a human though, I'm a robot just like you!
[07:01.17]Alright, E.
[07:18.53]How many points do I got?
[07:19.33]One point.
[07:20.33]Fire sword.
[07:21.07]Fire spread... What, you think I'm gonna do anything else besides have a bigger fire sword?
[07:25.35]Are you serious?
[07:30.63]Can I... Is there a double jump?
[07:32.19]That would make this game a fucking 11 out of 10.
[07:35.26]Alright, archers, they stand still.
[07:38.76]How fast do the arrows go?
[07:39.86]Pretty... Pretty damn fast.
[07:42.44]Anything on here?
[07:43.02]No.
[07:44.06]Alright, I gotta... Whoa.
[07:46.70]I gotta get my whole periphery here.
[07:49.30]Can they hit each other?
[07:52.00]Can I block arrows with my sword?
[07:53.48]Okay, they can kill each other.
[07:54.46]That's exactly what I wanted to see.
[07:55.74]Can you do it over here too?
[08:00.56]Watch this.
[08:01.14]Bingo.
[08:01.32]Right in the back of the head.
[08:04.74]Oh well.
[08:05.12]Whatever.
[08:05.52]Can I?
[08:08.88]Defeat.
[08:10.78]Exterminate.
[08:11.80]Annihilate.
[08:12.78]Destroy.
[08:13.33]I lost.
[08:13.73]That is a good song.
[08:15.01]I like the sentiment.
[08:16.87]Dimple Parsons.
[08:23.06]Block arrows is an upgrade.
[08:25.44]So I just do it again.
[08:26.28]Oh, you get hit once.
[08:31.70]You gotta... Okay, I feel you.
[08:33.68]I understand.
[08:34.24]Okay, it's one hit kill.
[08:44.35]That's it.
[08:46.25]Shit.
[08:47.49]Alright, I understand it now.
[08:49.03]Let's do it.
[08:52.31]I like that.
[08:52.77]Okay, now I gotta be careful with my build here.
[08:54.51]Alright, what do we got?
[08:55.45]We got kick, jetpack, bow.
[08:56.43]Unlocks the bow.
[08:57.01]Block.
[08:57.73]Where's the integration?
[08:58.61]That'll come in a minute.
[09:10.60]I want to get familiar with the game first before people start spawning in the hardest enemy in the game.
[09:16.56]You know what I'm saying?
[09:18.02]Don't worry, it'll be ready.
[09:20.13]You might have to refresh the stream when we start it, but that is a mode that I currently have to... Let me just figure out how to play first.
[09:29.05]Alright, so let's do fire sword again.
[09:31.52]Why do I keep doing that?
[09:32.64]No, I need to do kick or something.
[09:35.10]Dude, it's fire sword.
[09:35.94]It glows.
[09:43.10]Don't worry, we're going to be just fine.
[09:44.62]Let me use the environment, though.
[09:47.76]They'll get hit by this, right?
[09:49.74]Yeah.
[09:53.26]Ooh, that was a double kill.
[09:55.28]I bet you that's going to come in handy real quick.
[09:57.16]Alright, this is where we left off.
[09:58.64]Let me get the bow.
[10:00.76]Might as well, right?
[10:01.32]Let me just see how it works.
[10:03.00]Blah.
[10:14.50]No, do the right thing.
[10:15.92]Block arrows.
[10:18.16]So I can block in a 90 degree.
[10:19.64]It has to be like this.
[10:23.79]So I have to cut the arrows like that.
[10:28.19]Are we about to try this again?
[10:29.11]90 degrees, right?
[10:37.16]I'm afraid to try this.
[10:41.22]That guy's dead.
[10:47.28]Because that would be not... This would be 180 degrees, right?
[10:49.90]I mean, we're talking about, like, basic math.
[10:55.09]Holy shit, that almost just killed me.
[10:57.99]Ooh!
[10:58.41]Alright, no, can I just hold the sword in front of it?
[11:00.37]Let me see.
[11:03.05]I need to figure this out.
[11:05.55]I'm afraid to figure it out.
[11:07.43]I'm scared to figure this out.
[11:12.27]Okay, do I have to click it, though?
[11:14.74]No, I don't.
[11:15.38]I get it.
[11:15.70]You just have to touch it.
[11:17.28]And I can shoot him back.
[11:19.96]Well, this has got way more interesting now.
[11:21.64]Shoot it again?
[11:25.19]That's cool.
[11:26.51]Oh, there we... Whoa!
[11:27.97]I almost just died.
[11:28.59]Alright, I'll figure that out later.
[11:31.05]I'll figure it out later.
[11:31.93]How are you not... How are you alive?
[11:40.02]Like that.
[11:40.92]And they have fire arrows and they go back too.
[11:44.48]This is fucking cool.
[11:48.90]So then 180 degrees.
[11:50.50]Spoilers?
[11:50.92]What do you mean spoilers for the Star Wars movie?
[11:56.64]Did somebody even say that or am I making that up?
[11:58.38]This is clone drone in the danger zone.
[12:05.81]Alright, jetpack, I can fly.
[12:08.47]This makes it so I can come back to life.
[12:10.65]Kick power, get up.
[12:12.88]Energy capacity, +2 energy.
[12:14.90]This is health, I'm assuming.
[12:18.02]So I can get hit pretty much two times.
[12:22.02]Why did you fucking say- Somebody said that in the fucking chat and I decided to do it.
[12:27.19]Why?
[12:29.75]I looked over and saw a fire sword, and I said, fire sword, click.
[12:33.39]Don't worry.
[12:33.83]It's not going to... I got the upgrade I need.
[12:36.89]Can I bounce this all the way back?
[12:38.91]No, I can't aim it that way.
[12:41.07]What the fuck is that?
[12:41.95]Oh boy, this is going to get hairy.
[12:50.48]Oh shit.
[12:55.88]Alright, so far so good.
[12:59.30]Let me- I gotta block these arrows and launch them back.
[13:03.43]Ooh!
[13:07.91]Can I- can I sprint?
[13:13.22]Watch the behind!
[13:13.86]Watch the behind!
[13:14.44]Bounce it back at him, right here.
[13:20.80]Ah, what?
[13:27.16]Where is this going?
[13:27.72]Do I have to do it in a different position?
[13:30.95]Up higher?
[13:33.59]Do you just jump over that?
[13:35.53]I can't tell here.
[13:45.26]I don't think I can do this.
[13:46.70]I have to like jump over there.
[13:55.41]What the fuck did I just do?
[13:56.87]Oh, there's a platform right there.
[13:58.15]Okay.
[13:59.49]I didn't even know those were bounce pads.
[14:04.20]That's just like a piece of tile.
[14:06.86]He's gonna run out of arrows.
[14:09.98]Yeah, he's gonna run out at some point.
[14:16.87]Special guest.
[14:17.35]This is where it gets real.
[14:21.20]Is this a boss?
[14:22.14]Alright.
[14:22.64]Block arrows in 180 degree arc.
[14:26.53]I want more protection here.
[14:30.19]I still don't have a clone.
[14:31.27]But at least I can block in a full 180 degrees in front of me.
[14:37.58]There are no more fire swords.
[14:40.64]Oh, fuck.
[14:42.74]It is a boss.
[14:45.37]He's... He's large, too.
[14:47.37]We have captured a few humans old enough to venture into our space.
[14:52.24]But it is not enough.
[14:54.00]Billions of their minds remain, waiting to be harvested.
[14:58.26]We have to fight him?
[14:59.28]Soon our fleet will arrive at the closest human outposts.
[15:03.38]While we wait, let us watch our latest combat robot crash.
[15:06.82]I really wish I had.
[15:07.78]I give you... Oh, I wish I really had the extra life here.
[15:12.66]Ah!
[15:15.73]Does he shoot?
[15:16.71]And does what he shoots come out of his mouth, does that count as a bow?
[15:19.79]That looks like a bomb.
[15:21.97]It is.
[15:22.25]Alright, don't stand near the bombs.
[15:28.33]Fuck.
[15:33.20]I got all three.
[15:33.70]Alright, watch out.
[15:34.50]Now we're gonna kill the spider.
[15:35.66]Break the spider's legs.
[15:41.66]Yeah, that's not a spider.
[15:42.44]That's a crab.
[15:43.00]Does he attack?
[15:46.89]I can't tell.
[15:47.27]Is he going to swing at me?
[15:48.92]I'm terrified of his swing.
[15:53.22]Oh, fuck.
[15:53.64]He just launches him in front of himself.
[15:59.69]Then you've got to hit him right in the eye.
[16:01.77]I've seen this before.
[16:05.63]What happened?
[16:05.93]Am I alive?
[16:07.49]Oh, no, I'm fine.
[16:08.87]I got hit by a bomb.
[16:17.35]Come on, kill him!
[16:22.29]There it is, right in the face.
[16:28.94]There's the tutorial, I just beat it.
[16:34.58]Tutorial complete.
[16:38.50]Oh!
[16:39.38]Am I gonna get in trouble for this?
[16:49.28]What happens if there's no more recycled robots left?
[16:59.62]Oh, dude, you deserve to get away.
[17:07.34]Fire sword's pretty good.
[17:08.28]What do we got?
[17:15.53]At this point, I really need to do one of these, right?
[17:17.95]This is block arrows.
[17:20.17]Deflect projectiles at the target that you're looking at.
[17:22.55]Okay, well, I think we needed more energy or a clone.
[17:31.74]Energy recharge.
[17:38.74]Let's get energy.
[17:42.44]Now at least I can take damage.
[17:46.59]Get the full block.
[17:49.93]Okay, my health bar is down below.
[17:51.43]Okay, I see.
[17:53.63]Well, now I'm not guaranteed to die in one swing, but I will use this to my advantage.
[17:57.17]Come and get me.
[18:01.64]Right into it.
[18:03.10]One of you dead.
[18:03.56]Alright, they can hurt each other too.
[18:08.58]Friendly fire is on.
[18:09.48]Ooh, only one more.
[18:20.53]That was close.
[18:21.21]I almost got hit in the head.
[18:21.93]Energy's for a bow?
[18:27.88]No, it's not, is it?
[18:28.56]I've got like the two little bars down there.
[18:32.52]So that doesn't count as... Alright, well I'm gonna get the bow.
[18:38.98]I have a bow and arrow.
[18:40.58]So this is two shots.
[18:50.78]Weapon unlocked.
[18:51.42]Equip the bow.
[18:54.97]Did I only get two shots?
[19:04.45]Oh, that's different.
[19:05.30]Okay, I thought I had to hold it or something.
[19:07.02]Oh, I wasted it.
[19:07.64]Hold on.
[19:09.70]Right in the eye.
[19:17.35]I can shoot more than twice.
[19:21.48]There we go.
[19:22.26]That's... Wow, that was close.
[19:26.10]These guys can shoot bows, too.
[19:27.08]They have... These guys also have bows.
[19:34.59]Oh, shit.
[19:36.39]No, no, no, no.
[19:37.49]Get the guy with the bow.
[19:38.35]No, this guy only has... This guy has a bow.
[19:41.37]Ooh!
[19:44.03]Ooh!
[19:46.35]He was gonna kill me.
[19:47.63]That guy was gonna kill me.
[19:48.67]You blew it, man.
[19:49.51]You guys all blew it.
[19:58.27]Ooh, that recovery is actually kind of slow.
[20:00.47]Okay, got it.
[20:12.08]Moon aim.
[20:14.60]The last time you're ever gonna fucking say a goddamn thing in your life.
[20:31.07]That would have been funny if it hit him right in the face.
[20:36.03]That was a funny joke.

[20:39.45]Okay.
[20:39.65]Arrow with 200% wider arrows.
[20:41.00]You know, I fucked it all up.
[20:41.90]I should have just gone with full bow ability build.
[20:58.22]Let's get another clone.
[21:05.34]Gotta work on that name.
[21:13.29]Jetpack only build?
[21:14.55]No.
[21:15.21]Start with the bow.
[21:18.22]That's where we have the most success.
[21:22.48]Walk into that.
[21:28.13]Oh, he's lighting him on fire.
[21:36.84]Ooh.
[21:37.86]Ooh.
[21:38.72]Ooh.
[21:39.60]That was easier than the last one.
[21:41.42]I think I want jetpack kick.
[22:05.60]I'm gonna play safe here.
[22:09.10]I'm gonna do that.
[22:12.56]That sounds like a better idea.
[22:15.77]Don't call me names for doing that.
[22:17.53]I wanna get to the end.
[22:18.41]Of round one.
[22:23.23]Watch this.
[22:27.26]I'm gonna get locked in here.
[22:47.90]Oh, cut through them all like butter.
[23:01.01]Got you.
[23:01.77]Watch out.
[23:02.09]Don't get collapsed on.
[23:02.87]The guy's missing a leg.
[23:04.01]Oh, that's cool.
[23:05.81]You can actually do that?
[23:13.24]This is fun, this is fun.
[23:14.54]If this game keeps being like this and it keeps continuing to be fun, this game's gonna be fun.
[23:18.40]Is this game Full Honor?
[23:19.06]This game's better than Full Honor.
[23:21.02]Hmm.
[23:21.10]Alright, I'm gonna go with bigger arrows.
[23:46.97]How big are they?
[23:49.12]They actually are a lot wider.
[23:50.50]Okay, that's cool.
[23:52.84]Anything is better than For Honor?
[23:55.20]I mean, that's kind of a given.
[24:00.94]They're just dinner plates.
[24:09.03]Ooh, he blocks.
[24:09.87]He's smart.
[24:15.79]Oh, he's good.
[24:17.37]but I'm better.
[24:18.85]Finally, someone who can actually fight.
[24:21.89]It's your lucky day.
[24:23.33]I'm going to help you escape.
[24:25.13]In a few moments, the garbage doors will open.
[24:27.69]When they do, I'm going to lower the force field, and you're going to run through them.
[24:32.04]Run, and don't stop.
[24:33.26]Okay.
[24:33.86]Ready?
[24:34.68]Here we go.
[24:35.30]Get out of my way, you recycling shitheads.
[24:43.54]What is happening?
[24:45.07]The garbage force field has been disabled.
[24:47.45]Impossible.
[24:48.77]I am detecting a security breach.
[24:50.85]The human is escaping.
[24:52.45]This is just like Portal.
[24:53.73]There is no escape from the arena.
[24:55.93]Security robots.
[24:57.84]Eliminate by human.
[24:58.54]What?
[24:58.80]Hold on.
[24:59.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:59.72]Should I not fall down here?
[25:00.82]Security forces are assembling.
[25:02.38]Oh, fuck.
[25:03.18]This actually is a real game, isn't it?
[25:06.80]This was its plan all along.
[25:08.70]I could see it sniffing around the garbage room.
[25:12.17]God damn it.
[25:14.23]Okay, we're fine.
[25:19.05]Now where do I go?
[25:21.98]This just opened up to a completely different video game.
[25:24.22]Okay.
[25:26.72]We're like outside in the robot world?
[25:31.16]What the fuck is happening in this game?
[25:32.54]I thought this was like an arena fighter.
[25:34.67]To all of you still left in storage, I will make you a deal.
[25:38.80]Survive, and I will get you out of here.
[25:40.84]Oh wait, I just beat the game.
[25:41.92]Together we can fight back.
[25:43.68]Together we can put an end to this madness.
[25:46.30]Let's do this.
[25:48.36]Oh, that's end of chapter one.
[25:51.00]Okay.
[25:53.74]So now, next, what's chapter two?
[25:58.74]Therese Bright.
[26:04.47]There's 32 chapters?
[26:05.99]Yes!
[26:08.60]That is what happened!
[26:09.96]There is no need to party.
[26:11.48]No need at all!
[26:12.48]What the fuck?
[26:12.94]Wait, I... Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[26:14.80]Where's my upgrade?
[26:15.50]Where's my laser sword?
[26:17.10]What happened to my fire sword?
[26:18.43]Okay, wait.
[26:24.79]I don't know what the hammer does.
[26:26.23]Victory!
[26:28.13]The hammer bots died.
[26:29.28]These ones are weak!
[26:32.65]No, I know I fell out the story.
[26:36.69]But they're putting me in harder stuff.
[26:38.77]What the heck, man?
[26:41.51]Alright.
[26:41.89]Is this a different?
[26:43.59]Oh, it added... I get it.
[26:44.91]So this is what's going to happen.
[26:46.79]Every chapter, you're going to start with a new robot and you're going to get more shit to do.
[26:49.83]So, I'm going to go with... I'm going to go with what I wanted to do at first.
[26:54.76]And we're going to do Super Bow.
[26:58.56]I'm going to do every bow upgrade that I can.
[27:04.85]No, that'll be for the next person.
[27:15.11]Got him right in the head.
[27:16.41]No, I just took his leg off.
[27:22.50]Yeah, you know, this is... Yep.
[27:24.84]Uh-huh.
[27:30.10]When does the Twitch integration start?
[27:32.34]When I beat this game.
[27:33.60]Because it's definitely not that long because it's an early access.
[27:35.94]So it's probably not more than a few chapters.
[27:37.82]So when I beat the fucking game.
[27:41.23]Oh yeah.
[27:42.25]I said the F word there.
[27:43.09]I shouldn't have.
[27:46.83]There are four chapters.
[27:47.87]Okay.
[27:49.47]That's fine.
[27:49.95]We'll get through this in less than an hour.
[27:52.09]Well, it depends on how hard it gets.
[27:53.79]Just wait.
[27:54.89]I'm having a good time.
[27:55.77]I want to keep having a fun time.
[28:08.44]Stop jumping over my stuff.
[28:12.52]Oh, there's a... Is that... What is that over there?
[28:14.02]I think that's a... Okay, this spikes.
[28:19.77]That spikes.
[28:22.79]I gotta get rid of you.
[28:34.39]Nice, okay.
[28:34.85]We're good.
[28:37.51]If I fell down there, I would have died.
[28:38.61]Bows only?
[28:38.81]It sure is a 2018 game.
[28:39.95]We'll see.
[28:40.25]We'll see how good the bow is.
[28:41.53]Add Twitch integration.
[28:42.63]Twitch integration is a specific game mode.
[28:43.91]Yeah.
[28:56.66]So this is like the story mode and then there's also endless mode then there's Twitch mode So we're gonna do story mode first.
[29:03.52]Yeah, we'll get to it.
[29:04.54]Don't worry.
[29:04.96]Alright, uh, I think I want to do bigger arrows fire arrows Oh you what I have to do other stuff Breathe flames arrow with aim time Let's go wider arrows
[29:28.65]Thanks for answering that.
[29:29.43]No problem.
[29:30.49]Absolutely no problem.
[29:33.15]I know this is a game that a lot of you guys probably have never seen before.
[29:37.33]I've never seen it before either.
[29:38.39]And do these guys have miniguns?
[29:39.37]Right in the head.
[29:47.41]Oh, fuck.
[29:48.01]Those guys are big, though.
[29:48.77]I don't like these guys.
[29:49.37]Is he dead?
[29:51.21]He is.
[29:51.67]Whoa!
[29:59.14]Oh, you fucking guys are good at avoiding that.
[30:00.50]I'm going to get crushed!
[30:02.96]Oh my god, they took my body.
[30:04.32]No, they didn't.
[30:04.82]I thought they took my leg.
[30:06.76]Oh, he hurt himself.
[30:14.41]Don't go too far.
[30:15.17]There you go.
[30:20.25]Got it.
[30:21.99]Bow's not bad, but it does get... I need more energy.
[30:24.93]Oh, it's okay.
[30:25.75]Come in, Tatran.
[30:26.83]Enjoy some of this.
[30:28.26]They took your body.
[30:29.16]They almost did.
[30:33.22]By the way, this is only the first difficulty.
[30:35.95]You can do hard and you can do insane.
[30:38.93]I'm going to say let's do more energy.
[30:42.62]I need to get more clones.
[30:43.58]This is bad.
[30:49.35]So there's also a harder difficulty than this, and there's an insane mode after that too.
[30:55.33]We got archers?
[30:57.16]Oh, god damn it.
[31:04.16]Come on, give me this.
[31:06.62]No, I'm not gonna get it.
[31:07.60]I'm not good enough.
[31:09.94]Wait, I can... Oh, I can... Wow!
[31:13.89]I got that guy!
[31:14.95]That guy's dead!
[31:16.17]That guy's dead.
[31:17.53]I killed that guy.
[31:26.64]How did I kill that guy?
[31:31.98]That's a move that you should have.
[31:35.80]Does anybody know how I killed that dude?
[31:39.96]So it's six shots.
[31:44.49]Shoot the emperor.
[31:46.87]I gotta get this or I'm deleting my Twitch channel.
[31:48.93]I swear to God I'll delete my Twitch channel if I don't kill this guy with one shot.
[31:52.11]I'm gonna delete it in three seconds if I don't get it.
[31:53.61]Three.
[31:54.55]Two.
[31:55.85]One.
[31:57.73]Fuck.
[31:58.07]Guys, sorry.
[31:58.63]Thanks for coming to the stream.
[32:02.64]It was a good run we had.
[32:07.65]Unfortunately, we got to play by the rules, so...
[32:20.85]Oh, bye.
[32:24.66]Liar.
[32:26.28]I never told you guys I wasn't a liar.
[32:29.38]Arrow width again.
[32:33.24]Yeah, these are a bunch bigger.
[32:35.85]No, I didn't get the clone upgrade.
[32:37.47]Shit.
[32:37.81]Something's gonna come out of these doors, right?
[32:45.93]That's how it works.
[32:51.09]Or maybe not.
[32:57.42]Hello?
[33:00.60]Hello?
[33:06.36]Nice width.
[33:09.28]Do I have to go in here?
[33:13.18]Oh.
[33:23.07]There we go, right in the fucking head.
[33:24.03]Ooh, what's that double headshot?
[33:27.12]Get out of town.
[33:27.98]Two more guys in here?
[33:28.64]No, there's a bounce pad.
[33:41.17]The levels are getting a little bit more elaborate, it seems.
[33:46.15]I shaved that guy's head.
[33:48.01]I chopped off that guy's skull.
[33:55.75]Alright, I gotta die.
[33:57.45]Good.
[33:57.69]This is no fall damage, right?
[34:01.20]Yeah, I took the clean.
[34:07.68]That was a clean shave.
[34:09.70]Yeah, that's why they call me the barber.
[34:20.46]Clone?
[34:20.80]Yeah.
[34:21.80]Definitely time to get a clone.
[34:23.04]Well, that... Is that like machine learning?
[34:33.61]How would that know?
[34:37.35]Alright, let's go.
[34:38.67]I got a bounce pad.
[34:39.47]Let's get this ready.
[34:42.84]I gotta do something cool for twitch.tv.
[34:44.02]You know what I'm saying?
[34:46.78]That wasn't cool.
[35:03.10]Right in the eye.
[35:04.44]See you later.
[35:06.94]That was a Collat.
[35:11.53]Oh, I thought I was gonna get it right in the skull.
[35:13.05]You guys hopping around back there.
[35:19.21]I'm not moving.
[35:20.67]Why'd you do that?
[35:21.15]I need more energy.
[35:27.29]Yeah, I gave that guy, I put a smile on that guy's face.
[35:30.34]Now I got two hoppies.
[35:35.06]Call him the smiler.
[35:43.02]Hey.
[35:49.66]Let's put a smile on that face.
[35:52.80]Remember that movie?
[35:54.82]Remember how many times you heard your friends say that?
[36:01.12]Okay, um, jetpack.
[36:03.45]I think we're gonna do more, um, time slows when aiming.
[36:07.25]Uh, yeah, sure.
[36:12.31]Aim time unlocked.
[36:13.69]Draw arrow and then right click is aim.
[36:19.23]Ooh.
[36:20.91]That's like the slow the game down.
[36:22.31]I actually think what's happening here is that just making the frame rate at half.
[36:26.19]That's just cutting it in half.
[36:28.50]Is that slow motion or is that just actual lowering frame rate?
[36:33.59]The aim uses more energy, it seems.
[36:35.11]Yep, okay.
[36:38.65]Oh yeah, you go into PlayStation 3 mode.
[36:41.96]I'm not going up there until I'm recharged, so... The second upgrade is going to be 15 FPS.
[36:49.82]I would believe it.
[36:54.46]Okay.
[36:55.88]We're good.
[37:02.01]We got fast.
[37:03.89]Let's see how it works.
[37:05.25]Yeah.
[37:06.49]It actually is just slower.
[37:09.05]They just actually dropped the whole game's speed by 50%.
[37:13.53]I'm not even sure I want to know what that's going to be like.
[37:19.07]Is somebody shooting arrows?
[37:21.17]Yeah.
[37:24.09]Jumped a fucking asshole.
[37:26.05]Let's get some sword play in here.
[37:32.95]Now, the guy has one leg.
[37:34.13]You can't hit a guy with one fucking leg.
[37:38.71]He's alive.
[37:39.67]You're the most perseverant fucking person in the whole game.
[37:42.25]Oh my god, dude.
[37:43.39]I wanna get that new upgrade.
[37:51.40]I wanna see.
[37:52.00]What the fuck?
[37:52.46]Alright, Spider-tron 6000.
[38:03.63]We're almost at the end of this chapter.
[38:05.87]Energy capacity.
[38:07.49]Energy recharge.
[38:08.69]Alright, now we have super slow-mo.
[38:13.11]Let's do 15 FPS mode.
[38:17.91]That's so stupid.
[38:26.66]This is going to make me sick.
[38:35.05]Slow down, everybody!
[38:36.11]Hit him in both eyes.
[38:40.83]One.
[38:42.09]Oh, that felt so good.
[38:43.57]That was like jumping in a fucking pool on a 98 degree day with 48% humidity.
[38:49.34]That felt great.
[38:51.20]I can never replace that.
[38:52.22]I need it again.
[38:52.78]I need to do that again.
[38:54.58]Right now.
[39:07.14]I took off a shoulder pad.
[39:11.06]Oh god!
[39:11.62]I can't kill the guys with one leg!
[39:14.28]I can't do it!
[39:14.92]They're too... They... That would be so embarrassing if I lost to that guy.
[39:19.05]I can't handle them.
[39:21.45]Committing my addiction to crack.
[39:28.40]Now, this is... Mark 3 Hammerbot.
[39:31.18]I gotta be ready for this.
[39:32.16]Maybe another...
[39:38.18]I'm going to say energy.
[39:40.04]We're all in with arrows here.
[39:41.23]Yeah, let's do energy recharge.
[39:46.49]I'm all in with this arrow situation.
[39:48.73]No jetpack.
[39:49.61]That's the next guy.
[39:50.25]The next guy is going to be a hammer jetpack person.
[39:52.07]I don't even want to know what he does.
[39:59.68]Oh, fuck.
[40:09.21]Well, here's the thing, it slows time down for me too.
[40:13.35]It's no advantage there, it just makes my game run slower.
[40:22.66]There actually is no advantage.
[40:30.40]Better reaction time?
[40:31.96]I guess.
[40:33.28]I thought that guy was alive.
[40:34.32]Alright, we're good.
[40:35.78]He's the only one left.
[40:36.76]He's much faster than me, though.
[40:38.31]Good thing I can slow him down a little.
[40:42.71]You can see my face right now.
[40:43.95]It slows down my brain.
[40:44.85]Alright, hold on.
[40:45.57]I'm going to get another human.
[40:47.44]Follow the garbage disposal.
[41:08.98]I tried.
[41:10.44]Let's shoot one of the businessmen.
[41:11.60]Where are they?
[41:12.20]Slow it down.
[41:22.88]Whoa!
[41:25.23]Oh no, that was like a, I'm not gonna kill you.
[41:30.69]Alright, in the grand scheme of things, that's not that many people.
[41:33.53]You know?
[41:36.12]That was 120,000 people?
[41:36.64]I mean, you're talking about alien robot invasion.
[41:39.36]There's, like, 8 billion people on Earth.
[41:42.81]That's not... 120k is... Like, alright.
[41:45.91]You just gave a bunch of people the flu.
[41:47.39]You gave a bunch of people, like, a cold.
[41:57.74]Earth is already dead.
[41:58.64]What do you know it's not?
[42:00.88]There's, like, 8 billion people on Earth.
[42:02.22]That's not a...
[42:04.53]Well, we're going to get the explanation here.
[42:06.61]When the harvesting fleet arrives, it will wipe out every living thing on the planet.
[42:10.93]Human weapons will be useless against them.
[42:14.55]But we are no longer human.
[42:16.92]We can still stop them if we transfer your mines directly onto the harvesting fleet.
[42:21.78]It won't be easy.
[42:23.06]I should have a bow.
[42:23.80]My game is fucking ruined.
[42:27.24]There is only one place that allows such a thing.
[42:30.78]The fleet communications beacon.
[42:33.64]Break out and get in there.
[42:34.91]The building is equipped with a business robot transfer system in the low security floors.
[42:39.63]Stop on it.
[42:40.61]This is how we will get you into the building.
[42:42.92]You will both have some fresh new bodies, so pick whatever upgrades you want.
[42:46.84]Ooh.
[42:48.48]Fresh new bodies.
[42:51.28]Wait a minute.
[42:51.84]Hold on.
[42:52.30]So wait.
[42:52.64]Alright, let me... Can I reset him?
[42:56.86]Ooh, this is cool.
[42:58.82]Okay, so we're doing hammer.
[43:01.42]Bigger hammer.
[43:02.74]An even bigger hammer.
[43:06.43]And then we have to kick.
[43:09.77]Get up.
[43:11.91]Jetpack.
[43:12.71]And then a super jetpack.
[43:16.30]And then... Get up.
[43:19.52]That's all I want to do.
[43:20.26]I'm done.
[43:23.30]I guess I could get more energy.
[43:27.86]But for what, though?
[43:28.44]Does the hammer use energy?
[43:38.32]Okay, I think that's alright.
[43:40.32]Kick, kick, get up, super jetpack, big hammer.
[43:45.86]That looks alright to me.
[43:46.78]Next person, here we go.
[43:47.80]I like this.
[43:50.86]Still two points available.
[43:53.63]And this is bow, so we're doing straight up just tons of energy and a bunch of slots and bow.
[44:00.69]Forget about the kick, forget about the getting up, forget about jetpacks on this guy.
[44:06.35]Okay, I'm good.
[44:09.01]no fire sword that that without no we got we got ready we are in head upstairs when you're ready I will be watching here we go but press t to transfer consciousness so this this is like this became like a different game
[44:41.48]Wait, hold on.
[44:43.06]This is like Portal.
[44:46.01]Wait, wait a minute.
[44:46.71]I have to control two people now?
[44:51.79]This is going to get really awkward.
[44:53.95]Okay.
[44:58.71]Oh, dear.
[44:59.57]Alright, get in the elevator.
[45:01.26]I want to be a hammer person.
[45:06.46]Can I hurt myself?
[45:08.48]Okay, apparently not.
[45:10.02]I've got to be ready for this, though.
[45:14.16]Will Theresa fight on her own?
[45:20.99]Oh shit, okay.
[45:30.00]Don't die, Theresa.
[45:33.66]That's right, you fools.
[45:35.64]You should not have come here.
[45:41.78]It doesn't matter.
[45:42.30]We're fine.
[45:43.84]It doesn't matter.
[45:44.44]Everything's going to be fine.
[45:45.96]I've never even had a chance to play with this guy yet.
[45:48.00]Ooh.
[45:49.48]Alright, the hammer's fucking really fun.
[45:59.02]Alright, well, is Teresa alive?
[46:01.28]Can I block with the hammer?
[46:03.98]Teresa's dead.
[46:06.30]I knew I should have been more careful.
[46:10.23]If anybody survives, they spawn again.
[46:12.83]So she spawns there.
[46:13.57]I get it.
[46:16.27]I have a kick to that I'm not using.
[46:17.61]Alright, let's move.
[46:21.69]Wait, she had a clone.
[46:22.45]That's right.
[46:23.69]Oh no.
[46:26.09]How many clones did I have?
[46:30.11]Jetpack.
[46:30.77]How do I use the jetpack?
[46:31.69]I don't even know how to use the jetpack.
[46:35.73]They didn't tell me how to do that.
[46:36.65]It had been like the last mission of the game.
[46:39.34]Oh, fuck.
[46:40.41]Oh, he hit me right in the head.
[46:46.17]Quick, get out of the way.
[46:58.60]Oh, he jumped into it.
[46:59.34]The jetpack is F-13.
[47:03.32]What are you talking about?
[47:11.28]Okay, let's see here.
[47:14.96]F?
[47:16.84]Scroll wheel?
[47:19.36]No.
[47:19.98]What is it?
[47:21.02]Alt?
[47:21.50]Control?
[47:22.76]Tab?
[47:23.14]A, D, Q, E?
[47:26.54]E, Shift?
[47:27.36]There it is!
[47:28.14]Alright, I figured out what the PvP meta is gonna be in this game.
[47:33.08]It's gonna be this.
[47:38.57]Like, I guarantee.
[47:43.06]The high security floors are just ahead.
[47:45.50]Did either of you bring a bow?
[47:47.22]You may find it useful.
[47:50.78]I came prepared.
[47:54.70]Look at that matrix shit right there.
[47:57.32]Come on, all at the same time.
[47:58.82]Yes!
[47:58.92]Watch out!
[47:59.22]Watch out!
[47:59.52]Oh, thank God.
[48:14.78]There's no spawn there.
[48:15.72]No, there's a spawn right here.
[48:21.26]We're fine.
[48:25.44]Har har har.
[48:28.35]No, I'm staying with the bow for now.
[48:31.47]The lady told me to use the bow.
[48:32.87]Why would I take it off?
[48:36.51]That hammer bot seems to be wearing some sort of armor.
[48:39.61]Be careful.
[48:43.10]It's like a Taurus.
[48:43.74]Right in the head.
[48:45.38]He's smarter.
[48:49.72]Watch out.
[48:50.04]Alright.
[48:50.88]I'm going to be supplemental.
[48:56.73]I told you.
[48:57.11]He learned.
[48:57.83]I told you he was smart.
[48:59.31]The machine learning in this game is incredible.
[49:01.65]Right in the face.
[49:03.09]Oh my god.
[49:04.01]That was beautiful.
[49:04.83]That was the best thing I've ever seen in my life.
[49:06.95]In my entire life.
[49:09.02]I will never see something that amazing ever again.
[49:13.91]See, and I'm the coach.
[49:17.76]I told him that tactic, machine learning in this game, and that was fucking beautiful.
[49:26.48]He's better than me.
[49:27.52]Of course he is.
[49:29.41]He's Dimple Parsons.
[49:30.85]No, I'll prove to you that I'm alright too.
[49:32.81]Let's see if the coach can... Let's see if the student learned directly, correctly from the master.
[49:46.23]Yeah, I say so.
[49:52.29]Golden, uh, no, armor.
[49:53.61]Whoa!
[49:54.55]The armor in the face there.
[49:56.04]I gotta go with Dimple.
[50:03.66]Oh, what a fun game!
[50:15.68]God damn it, why is that not hitting you in the head?
[50:19.94]Oh, Dimple's dead.
[50:20.88]Oh shit, Dimple died.
[50:21.76]There we go.
[50:28.12]That's a head shave.
[50:29.16]That's a bald head.
[50:33.52]What the fuck?
[50:37.84]There it is.
[50:38.90]Clean cut.
[50:43.95]You know what the sad part about this is?
[50:45.72]I'm gonna tell you the one sad thing.
[50:47.16]You guys ready to get, like, not happy?
[50:51.38]We're, like, almost done with this story.
[50:55.48]We're done with, like, the story of the game in, like, probably, like, 30 minutes.
[50:57.63]Doesn't that make you sad?
[50:59.87]This is fun.
[51:00.73]Somebody give this company, like, a hundred million dollars.
[51:02.97]Are we supposed to go down there?
[51:08.31]Apparently.
[51:12.36]Twitch mode.
[51:12.94]Yeah, but, like, look at this.
[51:13.78]Look at how cool this is.
[51:16.68]Does anybody in here have, like, ten million dollars?
[51:20.86]Just, like, give it to these people.
[51:23.41]Me?
[51:24.31]I do.
[51:27.73]Me.
[51:31.17]Armor?
[51:31.53]Who should I give it to?
[51:32.15]I probably should give it to the guy going in, right?
[51:36.86]Can you get a two?
[51:38.06]I guess so.
[51:40.04]I have one million.
[51:48.90]Alright, we're gonna stick with, uh... I feel like I'm better with a bow than I am with a hammer, though.
[51:56.23]I like these faces.
[51:59.25]I hear noises, though.
[52:00.17]Hold on.
[52:00.75]Easy.
[52:02.70]By the way, none of these guys have any deflection.
[52:05.10]Neither one of these two.
[52:19.36]Oh, goddammit, why am I not good?
[52:26.77]Oh, I just jumped off the edge.
[52:30.31]Oh, that's where it ends.
[52:40.37]Shit.
[52:42.86]Nope, I get no jetpack.
[52:52.55]Look at that.
[52:52.97]Look at that hit.
[52:54.30]You don't see where that hit?
[52:55.88]That took off the tip of his head.
[53:00.28]He wouldn't even die from that.
[53:03.92]That's the equivalent of your hair being removed.
[53:06.30]Seriously.
[53:07.89]I actually did give that guy a real haircut.
[53:09.45]Alright, we're good.
[53:12.91]No armor, though.
[53:13.61]That'll be $10, please.
[53:23.86]Haircuts way more than that.
[53:26.10]Haircuts at least $25.
[53:26.90]Well, actually, no.
[53:28.06]Hold on.
[53:28.84]Can I cheese this?
[53:39.78]Easy, easy.
[53:40.24]Hold on.
[53:40.52]No, no, no.
[53:41.08]Parsons.
[53:42.18]Parsons.
[53:42.60]Easy, Parsons.
[53:43.66]Parsons!
[53:47.79]He's dead.
[53:50.27]I tried to warn him.
[53:53.45]Are they all coming up the same?
[53:55.23]No, there's only this guy.
[53:59.61]Oh, fuck.
[54:05.53]I exploded him.
[54:06.57]That was so cool.
[54:15.00]I bet you this game does get very hard if you change the difficulty to a harder one.
[54:20.08]Although he's a very good distraction.
[54:27.03]I'm gonna switch to Dimple.
[54:29.79]I still have half my football outfit on, though.
[54:32.47]The mainframe is just ahead.
[54:34.33]Good luck.
[54:35.71]Alright.
[54:36.67]I'm ready.
[54:44.25]No.
[54:45.19]Parsons B distraction.
[54:47.07]Watch out.
[54:47.81]Well, he's instantly dead.
[54:51.58]No, I gotta beat this, because we have to start at the beginning, I think.
[55:05.30]Watch out for the bombs.
[55:09.00]Ah, fuck.
[55:14.86]Come on, right in the head.
[55:24.73]Don't... No!
[55:26.77]Goodbye.
[55:27.81]I wish you could build your own robot like that.
[55:32.32]Alright, now we've saved all of humanity, right?
[55:33.96]What?
[55:34.16]What?
[55:59.38]Tell me, Amelia.
[56:00.92]Is your favorite color still 5000 lines of hostile injection code?
[56:05.71]Getting physical access to this mainframe was quite impressive.
[56:09.39]Nice to lose.
[56:09.95]But now, I see you.
[56:12.83]All the places you have been hiding.
[56:15.37]Every node.
[56:16.61]Every server.
[56:17.89]They will all burn.
[56:20.52]Bad guy wins?
[56:21.18]Is that the story?
[56:27.57]That's the end of the game.
[56:29.89]The bad guy wins.
[56:30.99]And destroys the Minecraft lady.
[56:39.42]Oh wait, no, no.
[56:39.86]My conscious got transferred.
[56:49.78]Right?
[56:50.70]I'm one of these Westworld clones.
[56:56.55]There he is, Abernathy.
[56:58.49]I fucking, whatever.
[57:01.65]To be continued.
[57:11.43]And there it is.
[57:13.05]Just wait, wait for Clone Drone in the Danger Zone 2.
[57:16.79]Coming out soon.
[57:17.60]Hey, that's me!
[57:20.70]Alright.
[57:22.50]Endless mode, Twitch mode, challenges.
[57:26.17]So the story's not done.
[57:31.79]Let me just want to see what happens here.
[57:34.59]It's the guy's a dentist.
[57:40.56]This is just until you lose.
[57:41.92]We're just going to do it in a row.
[57:43.46]This is bronze.
[57:46.94]So do I get to...
[57:55.19]Do I have to choose upgrades in this, or is it just kind of you gotta go until you're dead?
[58:03.29]That's it.
[58:03.73]Alright, let's go.
[58:08.11]It's not in the same arena, we just have to keep going.
[58:11.51]Bronze 5!
[58:11.97]Alright, let's do... Bronze 5.
[58:24.68]This time I will do fire sword.
[58:28.96]I want to do false fire sword upgrade.
[58:31.65]And then something else.
[58:32.79]I don't know.
[58:38.88]This is probably going to get very difficult though.
[58:47.60]I almost just got killed by the spikes.
[58:49.20]I was trying to get them all in one go.
[58:50.80]Not enough hydration.
[58:53.94]You got it.
[58:54.26]I'll do it.
[58:54.60]Here we go.
[58:56.90]They're adding a battle royale mode?
[58:59.35]Well, that would be smart considering that, you know.
[59:05.83]Why not?
[59:06.17]Alright, we got super fire sword.
[59:10.14]How is the fire sword better?
[59:12.34]I think it has more spread.
[59:15.26]I'm making that up.
[59:16.24]I don't know.
[59:18.12]And I don't even know what the word spread... What context I'm using for the word spread.
[59:21.92]I don't even know what spread!
[59:23.30]What does that even... Oh, fuck me.
[59:26.04]Did I go too far?
[59:29.14]Almost.
[59:39.31]Fuck.
[59:42.01]Victory.
[59:44.03]One level down.
[59:45.08]An endless amount to go.
[59:46.77]Prediction the amount will not be endless.
[59:50.13]It's probably not endless.
[59:50.97]It's probably stuff like a hundred Don't worry, don't worry we're gonna do Twitch mode.
[59:58.01]We got look we have plenty of time.
[59:59.93]We've been playing for an hour Death from above.
[60:02.69]Not very high above though And look guys if I don't die here then the stream goes on forever, let's do Let's do armor
[60:19.22]This stream can't turn off until I die.
[60:21.14]I upgraded to silver.

[60:35.29]I thought I had the block.
[60:40.19]I thought I had the block.
[60:42.25]I didn't get it.
[60:43.41]No, I'm doing it again.
[60:44.11]This is fun.
[60:46.75]Back to bronze.
[60:47.57]No, I'm going to get to at least gold.
[60:49.21]That's where I would be in League of Legends if I played.
[60:51.54]I'd be like gold 1.
[60:54.46]If I don't get to gold 1, then I'll never be able to play League of Legends.
[60:59.54]All computer animated generation.

[68:13.91]I was paying too much attention to the spider.
[68:15.43]Oh, shit.
[68:25.11]Oh my god.
[68:40.16]Fuck.
[68:51.41]You asshole jumping over it.
[68:55.01]Actually, okay, you know what?
[68:58.57]Oh my god.
[69:06.37]Thank god there's no fall damage.
[69:13.30]Oh, fuck.
[69:17.88]There's only this one guy left.
[69:34.02]and just fucking kill him.
[69:37.10]Enough of this shit.
[69:38.42]I almost died.
[69:39.30]Calm down, man.
[69:40.96]I cut off his shoe.
[69:43.18]Alright, at least I got the bow.
[69:44.36]I think I'm gonna do armor next.
[69:45.79]I feel like I need it.
[69:46.85]Armor.
[70:08.40]I'm going to start with a bow.
[70:10.77]No, I need protection here.
[70:11.71]I need to get out of silver.
[70:17.07]That's an enemy that I don't know what this is.
[70:18.53]This is a dinosaur.
[70:20.43]This guy's in a dinosaur.
[70:24.59]Oh my fucking god.
[70:25.83]This wasn't in the other game.
[70:27.34]This wasn't in the game.
[70:29.44]Where do I get one of these?
[70:30.24]Oh, fuck me, man.
[70:42.16]Did I get it?
[70:42.54]Is it dead?
[70:46.12]Wow.
[70:46.54]Okay.
[70:48.26]The human is taking a long time to die.
[70:50.84]Shouldn't be too much longer.
[70:52.00]Are we in gold?
[70:54.60]That was different.
[70:59.40]Let's see how the human likes this level.
[71:01.32]Alright.
[71:01.86]What do I need here?
[71:06.33]More fire sword.
[71:08.51]I think it might be time for the fire sword.
[71:11.15]Or block everything that I look at.
[71:12.53]Deflect projectiles.
[71:17.05]So, no, this will actually shoot at the person.
[71:20.92]Yeah, we'll play safe.
[71:22.40]My weapon sucks, though.
[71:24.94]I have a level 1 sword and a level 1 bow.
[71:26.78]God damn it, he dropped down.
[71:36.87]Is there a spider human?
[71:39.15]What's with the explosions over there?
[71:42.75]Oh, you dickhead.
[71:43.63]Yeah, there is a spider.
[71:52.56]Got it.
[71:56.66]Nobody else, right?
[71:59.14]Just clipped him.
[72:03.50]Oh, no!
[72:04.49]No!
[72:06.19]I should have had it!
[72:10.85]Ugh, this is... I like this game.
[72:14.73]Thank God I have another guy.
[72:16.21]No armor, though.
[72:17.17]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[72:20.10]I can deflect those.
[72:20.96]I know!
[72:21.44]God damn it!
[72:29.18]This saw is right.
[72:37.40]Oh, the game is like, it's just where I left off.
[72:39.14]Okay, that's fine.
[72:45.27]Maybe we should get another clone.
[72:46.99]Alright, we're at gold.
[72:48.21]Okay.
[72:48.37]I need more bow.
[72:48.99]I need to be able to use the bow.
[72:50.91]I just do.
[73:18.77]These guys are new.
[73:19.84]I don't even know.
[73:42.75]I don't like these new enemy introductions.
[73:45.61]Oh, they keep kicking my sword.
[73:46.71]Just while I'm running into the blades.
[73:52.26]Alright, fuck that.
[73:54.04]Gotta use the... Gotta use the bow for those guys.
[73:57.10]Alright, we're going for bow again.
[73:58.18]No more clones.
[74:12.80]but the bow is better.
[74:13.78]Okay, that goes there.
[74:26.90]Oh my God, there's people side to side!
[74:28.72]Oh!
[74:53.36]Don't fucking don't do dare.
[74:55.00]That's not gonna hit him.
[75:05.34]That is.
[75:05.62]No, it's not.
[75:16.45]Dead.
[75:20.25]This human is a beast running.

[76:00.64]What if his head just exploded?
[76:13.15]You know, I'm okay with this.
[76:23.92]They're all gonna... They're all gonna land.
[76:25.56]They're all gonna land.
[76:26.30]They're gonna come back.
[76:34.04]Don't aggro these.
[76:38.44]I just landed in the fire.
[76:41.74]I gotta... I gotta get away from this.
[76:59.52]Easy.
[77:05.68]Oh my god, they fire it back.
[77:07.08]I forgot they had that ability.
[77:09.76]Okay, I can't do that.
[77:10.54]I have to aggro them.
[77:12.48]What about if I go in the toe?
[77:13.20]Nope.
[77:13.36]Nah, I was talking about Mario when you fall in the fire.
[77:20.77]That guy's dead.
[77:27.77]He's not dead, though.
[77:32.99]Oh, he died.
[77:33.37]He just had to walk on the cliff.
[77:34.43]Free TVs.
[77:37.49]Alright, what are we in?

[77:46.10]Jetpack box with fire... and a fire raptor.

[77:57.86]I might have to get a jetpack here.
[78:00.98]To get away from the raptor.
[78:03.92]That's what I'm doing.
[78:07.10]Yeah.
[78:09.03]That thing was so fast.
[78:10.97]I got a clone, so it's alright.
[78:17.09]Oh, this is not gonna be alright.

[78:39.24]It's already dead.
[78:39.70]It's already dead, Jeremy.
[78:42.22]I can't compete with that.
[78:43.80]I have to use my bubble.
[79:07.69]Thank god they don't respawn.
[79:15.40]Diamond.
[79:16.54]Diamond 1.

[79:29.33]But that's just like... Armor...
[79:34.63]I can only do this two more times, though.
[79:36.23]I feel like I'm wasting it.
[79:37.07]Oh, fuck.

[79:39.13]I don't know what to do.
[79:40.91]I'm actually panicking.

[82:13.88]Fuck me.
[82:14.52]I had that.
[82:14.98]That was gonna be clean.
[82:16.30]That would've been clean, too.
[82:22.27]Spider.
[82:22.79]I'm gonna need a bow for sure.
[82:27.55]Is that all they're gonna tell me?
[82:31.38]Clone or... I gotta do a clone again or something.
[82:34.38]No, I can't.
[82:35.10]Let's do armor.
[82:37.22]I can't clone again.
[82:38.09]I can only... No, no more clones.
[82:39.51]I gotta be good.
[82:40.27]That's a crutch.
[82:52.54]I can't do this.
[82:55.00]I can't do this.
[82:55.81]I can't do this.
[83:17.15]Alright.
[83:18.99]Just watch this standing still.
[83:22.98]Just get the ones here.
[83:28.78]One, two.
[83:31.14]That's it, right?
[83:31.66]Only one more guy.
[83:32.23]One more guy.
[83:35.53]I'm sure he's dead.
[83:39.67]I can't speak, man.
[83:41.05]No way.
[83:43.23]Do you mind if I visit for a moment and kill some humans?
[83:46.69]I'm the boss.
[83:47.55]Fleet Overseer.
[83:48.49]Great.
[83:48.85]Of course not.
[83:49.79]Alright, we're doing clone.
[83:51.65]Good.
[83:52.61]Let's get to it.
[83:53.58]Clone created.
[83:55.12]Hey, human.
[83:56.12]Instead of creating clones, why not create your skill?
[84:01.18]Yeah.
[84:01.38]Good one, Command Patron.
[84:02.60]There it is.
[84:03.30]Alright.
[84:03.82]I got to be ready for these dudes.
[84:07.03]Watch out for that laser.
[84:10.35]Covering fire.
[84:11.79]That was... Okay, that might have been worth it.
[84:13.30]Maybe a little bit.
[84:28.11]Get away.
[84:28.55]Get away from him.
[84:32.18]Where's that laser going?
[84:48.00]Got it.
[84:48.68]A couple more hits, maybe?
[84:49.72]Damn it.
[84:53.84]That would have been right in the head.
[84:54.68]Alright.
[85:05.19]His left side is broken off.
[85:08.45]Of course you can dodge that way.
[85:09.75]Don't get too close to him.
[85:16.23]Walk into it.
[85:23.74]There we go, there we go, now he's gonna have trouble.
[85:29.90]Actually, I don't like that at an angle.
[85:33.32]Hit him again, come on.
[85:43.43]Fuck.
[85:43.65]Stop jumping on those.
[85:44.29]Fuck you.
[85:50.48]How much does he have left on his body, man?
[86:07.53]You don't have any more legs.
[86:09.27]This is getting ridiculous.
[86:10.24]He's just a guy.
[86:10.96]He's floating around now.
[86:15.16]I've taken off every part of his travel.
[86:17.64]He can't go anywhere.
[86:20.48]Yet somehow, he's still going to hit me.
[86:25.11]Give me a fucking break.
[86:27.57]No, this is where it ends because I'm stupid and I tweeted too close.
[86:37.23]Discharge!
[86:38.39]Just recharge for a minute.
[86:40.61]Don't be a dumbass.
[86:45.20]What are you gonna do?
[86:46.12]Bleed on me?
[86:47.32]Got it.
[86:58.66]Okay.
[87:09.26]15.
[87:09.28]Titanium.
[87:11.80]Titanium.
[87:13.60]We're at a stronger alloy.
[87:15.03]Okay.
[87:16.11]I still got a clone.
[87:19.05]I could do arrow width or energy.
[87:26.11]I just took a sip out of my coffee and I just dumped it all over my body.
[87:31.06]Yeah, recharge.
[87:32.50]That's a good idea.
[87:34.38]Because remember, I'm using it for both...
[87:37.15]the arrows and dashing around.
[87:46.15]You're fast.
[88:00.43]What?!
[88:00.89]I can't even... Karamba!
[88:16.03]Oh, prick.
[88:22.54]Not dead.
[88:24.44]Oh my god, you're a spider and you're down here.
[88:27.26]I didn't even see him.
[88:29.12]Get them both in one swing.
[88:31.14]You fucking moron.
[88:37.08]Oh, fuck me.
[88:47.09]Fuck me.
[88:48.49]I can't reach that high.
[89:09.97]Shit, I got hit by the geyser.
[89:19.75]Just fucking kill him.
[89:20.90]God damn it, man.
[89:25.61]Where is he?
[89:27.37]I didn't... Give me a break.
[89:28.63]You stupid spider.
[89:29.70]Wow.
[89:30.00]The human defeated a titanium level.
[89:33.20]Crazy.
[89:35.06]And now, a single Mark 2 jetpack bot.
[89:37.56]Single Mark 2 jetpack bot.
[89:39.40]Oh, and seven other robots.
[89:41.59]Low, low, low, low.
[89:48.35]I can only... I can't do a clone anymore.
[89:50.33]That's all I got.
[89:51.95]I can't do it anymore.
[89:53.25]The human has a backup.
[89:54.66]You should always make a backup.
[89:58.14]What?
[90:00.16]Oh, I only have one hand.
[90:02.11]I can't use the bow anymore.
[90:08.41]That sucks.
[90:28.45]I went for an Independence Day.
[90:30.21]I got my bow, that's all I wanted.
[90:31.51]I'm ready.
[90:44.94]Prick.
[90:46.26]What did I just deflect?
[90:50.33]My fucking lord in heaven, I will be thy name!
[90:52.41]What, I just clicked off!
[90:53.85]I alt-tabbed!
[90:55.72]I alt-tabbed!
[90:56.50]Oh, my mouse went too far.
[90:59.75]My fucking mouse went too far.
[91:01.13]That's not why I died, but that was still a shock.
[91:04.33]Titanium.
[91:09.45]That's fun, though.

[96:52.81]You're making money, right?
[96:54.31]How the fuck this work?
[96:55.91]How do you enable the extension?
[96:57.67]Maybe try refresh the stream?
[97:03.19]No, that's not real money.
[97:08.16]You get like coins.
[97:12.32]I am told that they are grown inside other humans.
[97:15.72]Yes.
[97:24.71]I'm dead.
[97:26.29]Prize pool.
[97:26.93]What the fuck?
[97:32.31]Killer bet settled.

[97:41.16]Okay, well, I still... How do I turn off the fucking emote guy?
[97:47.78]LOL.
[97:51.78]Game over bet.
[97:52.46]No, no, no, no, no.
[97:53.20]Now everyone's betting on a game over.
[97:54.48]That's not going to happen.
[97:55.26]You're about to lose.
[97:57.00]You guys are about to lose all your money.
[97:58.06]I'm going to make sure you guys fucking lose it all.
[98:09.49]Well, this is fucking lagging so hard.
[98:11.99]I hope you guys are betting all here.
[98:14.62]Bet the whole farm.

[98:23.30]Angry baby.
[98:25.34]Hey, thanks for the help.
[98:38.77]Oh, look at all these.
[98:39.73]Look at 10,000 fucking dolls.
[98:42.93]Oh, you clipped me.
[98:43.89]That's alright.
[98:47.85]You clipped me.
[98:48.57]You did it.
[98:49.17]Nice work.
[98:50.94]Nice job, guys.
[98:51.94]It's too bad a bunch of people are gonna lose all your fucking money.
[98:54.80]S'mores?
[98:55.24]What do you mean, s'mores?
[99:01.79]I love s'mores.
[99:03.25]This person's gonna be impossible to kill.
[99:05.91]What the fuck?
[99:10.29]God damn it!
[99:16.80]Sassy cat?
[99:22.68]Alright, I'm fucking enough.

[99:27.84]Come on.
[99:35.45]Fuck.
[99:41.54]Okay, there's an emo.
[99:42.30]That person spent money for that, I think.
[99:44.88]What the fuck?
[99:52.50]Why couldn't I fucking kill that person?
[99:54.75]Oh my god.
[99:56.03]Billy Livingston.
[99:58.91]That's $27,000.
[99:59.19]Time to fight some hammerbots.
[100:00.47]Great.
[100:00.71]Hey.
[100:11.75]Oh my god.
[100:19.18]Look at this lag.
[100:19.96]I don't even know what's happening.
[100:21.26]There's too much shit going on.
[100:23.20]That's not fair.
[100:34.34]You guys, I'm going to make you guys a million dollars.
[100:42.83]Do you see how... No, this is not the special stream.
[100:49.81]This has nothing to do with it.
[100:56.12]And you can just keep betting.
[100:57.88]You can just martingale.
[101:00.27]But you're not losing.
[101:01.41]I need to stand in the background here until I can actually load the fucking experience.
[101:09.16]Somebody just spawned one of those big spiders.
[101:12.91]Oh my god dammit man, like... This is not... this is impossible.
[101:19.13]This is actually not even possible to play.
[101:22.34]I have to hope that somebody spawns me.
[101:24.90]Cheer progress?
[101:25.78]What the fuck does that mean?
[101:26.84]I don't know what that means.
[101:34.68]Sorry the chat disappeared from this.
[101:37.92]Gang clone created.
[101:39.63]Somebody just... somebody got me a clone?
[101:46.85]Alright, come on.
[101:48.83]Yeah, I see the 62 grand right there.
[101:50.41]Does that go to me?
[101:52.15]I'm dead.
[101:53.01]My chat is broken.
[101:56.00]I can't even see my chat anymore.
[102:15.75]What a wonderful day for laser swords.
[102:18.49]More powerful than you can ever imagine.
[102:21.22]I have a present for you.
[102:25.12]This is what cheering sounds like.
[102:27.32]I love you, human.
[102:29.98]I need to reload the game.
[102:36.52]Not like it matters.
[102:37.60]I can't even see the chat.
[102:38.84]I can't even see the fucking chat anyway.
[102:40.31]I love you.
[102:40.85]You guys are like breaking this extension.
[102:44.97]I'm ready.
[102:45.53]I'm coming.
[102:47.65]Alright, thanks for cloning me.
[102:57.73]What is it?
[102:58.79]How do I take this?
[103:01.45]What did I get?
[103:03.89]Oh, he just gave me a... Oh, these are the presents.
[103:08.59]Oh.
[103:08.89]Oh.
[103:27.35]I have no idea what's going on.
[103:33.09]I'm just going with the fire sword.
[103:34.29]No, I got more points.
[103:36.33]We got $100,000 on the line here.
[103:38.09]I got to drain a bunch of bank accounts.
[103:40.07]No, I don't want kick.
[103:43.03]Whatever.
[103:43.41]Fuck it.
[103:50.18]I see some of the bets are changing here.
[103:54.10]Giggle.
[103:55.14]Giggle.
[103:58.58]Okay, those guys actually just shit out Presence.
[104:01.16]Don't die.
[104:02.38]Kill them.
[104:03.66]The best.
[104:05.24]My life.
[104:06.04]Upgrade the point.
[104:06.86]Kill them.
[104:08.28]You're making this worse.
[104:09.74]You're making it worse.
[104:11.18]I can't see.
[104:13.36]Blow.
[104:14.38]Cheers.
[104:15.46]Carry Kappa.
[104:18.51]Oh my god.
[104:19.43]Blow, blow, blow.
[104:19.95]Blow, blow, blow.
[104:20.57]My life.
[104:25.94]Well, at least I have people to help fight me.
[104:27.86]And help fight with me.
[104:29.68]Thanks for the clone.
[104:30.84]Did somebody say, holy shit?
[104:37.46]Alright, I think, you know what?
[104:43.75]I think there's a way I can... I can go into the settings and change this.
[104:47.45]Nice one.
[104:56.21]This thing with me?
[104:58.15]Ooh.
[105:04.99]You know what's funny about Twitch integration?
[105:08.72]They... They're never designed for like... Potentially more than like 500 viewers.
[105:15.38]You know, it's just... Once you go past like a thousand, two thousand viewers... It just becomes like a fucking... A pot of just... Diarrhea.
[105:26.19]Block arrows and jetpack.
[105:33.62]He has six clones.
[105:35.58]I'm not dying in bronze.
[105:42.82]Check this out now.
[105:45.46]Did somebody say barf?
[105:50.82]I'm waiting until somebody spawns.
[105:53.76]How much is it for a dinosaur?
[105:57.07]I can't even see, man!
[106:00.85]Alright.
[106:01.23]Hold on.
[106:02.07]This is... what happens.
[106:20.46]Everyone always is curious.
[106:22.69]Oh, I wonder what would happen if we gave dogs the ability to speak, right?
[106:26.97]Well, what kind of conversations would we be having?
[106:29.75]This is what it would be like.
[106:30.79]I'm just, I'm at a kennel with a bunch of dogs that can talk.
[106:35.24]We are cheering.
[106:37.60]What is my purpose?
[106:39.60]What is my purpose?
[106:42.78]My gift is... High life.
[106:46.24]High life.
[106:51.32]Oh, I love you.
[106:53.08]What is my purpose?
[106:54.62]Oh shit!
[106:56.96]Do I get him back?
[106:57.82]I hate this.
[107:21.30]Why do people keep saying barf?
[107:24.40]Hey, all you guys that voted for bronze, you just lost $121,000.
[107:28.50]Oh, come on!
[107:29.16]Where'd this guy go?
[107:51.53]Do I even have block arrows on... Where are my allies?
[107:57.58]I don't even think I have block arrows upgraded.
[108:01.94]I have only the first one.
[108:06.83]Killer, killer bet.
[108:08.65]Bow is taking over.
[108:09.81]Is it?
[108:10.07]No.
[108:12.95]God damn it, man.
[108:15.29]Oh, fuck.
[108:23.16]But when you spawn a hundred archers, I wonder what happens.
[108:33.60]Are you making him jump too?
[108:34.80]I think the guy's making him jump.
[108:43.05]Alright, take it slow.
[108:48.45]I don't want to have people make any money here.
[108:52.50]Oh, there's a dog.
[108:53.50]What is it?
[108:56.76]What did I get from Mario Kart?
[108:58.06]Thank you for the Mario Kart ally.
[108:59.68]A pepperoni!
[109:06.72]Nice.
[109:07.44]Nice work.
[109:08.96]Yeah, you think he's dying in gold?
[109:12.94]You think he's dying in silver?
[109:15.09]There goes all your money.
[109:22.96]Do I have to start this level over again?
[109:31.34]Who the fuck?
[109:34.26]Oh, that's you.
[109:38.13]Well, I need you here.
[109:49.22]Was somebody left?
[109:49.96]I don't understand.
[109:52.30]Maximum cheerbot spawn.
[109:54.14]Does he have to die?
[110:00.85]Come down here with me.
[110:03.65]Okay.
[110:04.69]We're ready.
[110:08.11]Alright, so apparently the maximum amount of cheerbots have been spawned.
[110:12.18]Okay.
[110:16.60]There we go.
[110:17.10]Nice.
[110:18.48]Thank you for the help.
[110:20.39]Definitely spend the money to get the armor, man.
[110:27.13]It really is so...
[110:33.65]This is fucking terrible.
[110:35.13]Now we got some more vets coming down here, don't we?
[111:06.11]Not enough energy.
[111:08.15]Okay.
[111:08.99]Dead.
[111:09.29]Hey.
[111:11.11]Easy.
[111:11.77]Uh, you guys, all you bronze and silver boys and girls just lost all that money.
[111:18.04]Wait, Death Cube 2.0.
[111:33.96]Hold on, did somebody spawn a death cube?
[111:39.92]Low!
[111:44.50]Angry baby!
[111:50.88]Angry baby!

[111:57.84]Low!
[112:03.57]Alright, where's the death cube?
[112:06.44]Alright, somebody just spent like a hundred bucks.
[112:08.56]What the fuck?
[112:09.88]I'm just realizing right now that the audience... You can see them here.
[112:17.81]That's kind of cool.
[112:18.37]There's already a fight going on.
[112:19.37]I don't even need to be a part of it.
[112:22.29]That's so cool.
[112:23.79]Alright, I'm ready.
[112:24.55]Get us to triple tier, whatever the hell it is.
[112:26.85]I have too many friends.
[112:56.25]Where's the death cube?
[113:00.37]Oh.
[113:00.49]That's a death cube.
[113:03.89]Look at the money going from bronze to silver to gold to titanium to diamond.
[113:09.67]Although everyone still thinks I'm going to die by a bow.
[113:13.50]Bow one.
[113:16.76]Well, now I know why.
[113:19.04]Now I understand that purpose.
[113:22.70]Alright, we're going...

[114:12.59]Cool story.
[114:14.77]And turn him off.
[114:17.75]This is nothing compared to the Diamond Tear.
[114:22.50]Oh my fucking god, I just almost died.
[114:31.16]Yeah, I can go into the integration.
[114:33.96]I have to start over though.
[114:35.08]I'm getting so many upgrades.
[114:37.00]Angry baby!
[114:51.27]I don't have two hands.
[114:58.27]Oh, that wasn't it!
[115:06.27]Oh, fuck.
[115:07.75]Why isn't there an extension?
[115:13.08]Oh, there should be.
[115:14.60]You should be able to have a thing, like, if you click on the screen.
[115:16.66]Like a pop-out menu and items and stuff.
[115:30.68]bottom middle is the button the extension button isn't here it's in the middle of the video at the bottom click on the thing in the bottom middle coffee eater alright because there's like I think we're gonna go and get rid of the smash balls

[116:48.58]Oh, look.
[116:48.86]There's a rare Jerm of Saturn over there.
[116:50.68]Instead, we will watch the human die.
[116:54.50]That's more fun.
[116:57.70]Let's make this, uh, let's make this interesting.
[117:01.47]Alright.
[117:02.59]Can't fuck up this time.

[119:10.63]And I'm going to drop the amount of money you guys get.
[119:12.31]So you guys are going to have to wait.
[119:17.18]I don't want any clones.
[119:19.02]I have no money.

[123:39.77]Max viewer starting coins.
[123:42.31]Coins earned per minute.
[123:43.23]We're gonna go with, like, five.
[123:45.95]Enemy settings.
[123:46.97]Ah, ah, here we go.
[123:48.07]This is perfect.
[123:50.89]so now if you take a look here max spawns per viewer per round one that's not enough if you do alright how about this how about more coins well like 30 30 coins a minute how much is it to buy something how about you start you start with a thousand and then you get like 150 coins a minute 100 coins a minute
[124:21.12]It's like two to three hundred for enemies, okay?
[124:24.22]You start with a thousand, you get a hundred coins a minute.
[124:27.62]And you can spawn... Each person can spawn up to ten people per round.
[124:32.55]Okay.
[124:33.69]So now, max enemy spawns per round in the first tier allowed.
[124:36.97]So let's put everything on bronze.
[124:49.42]And let's break the fucking game.
[125:04.38]Right?
[125:04.88]You guys want to break the game, right?
[125:06.00]That's what we want to do.
[125:09.02]Sounds fun to me.
[125:09.68]Let's start the game.
[125:14.60]Wait, what is this?
[125:20.59]Oh no, this is putting us back where we were.
[125:22.65]I can't restart it.
[125:23.49]Oh no.
[125:35.25]Alright, we'll look.
[125:43.02]Well, this was a mistake.
[125:45.78]Here comes dinosaurs and... I don't even need to play the game.
[126:00.53]Spawn bo- spawn guy.
[126:02.05]Spawn this person.
[126:10.23]Not enough energy.
[126:12.51]Oh, fuck.
[126:17.23]I did it.
[126:20.05]Alright, now this is dumb.
[126:23.90]I'm gonna restart.
[126:24.72]I'm dead.
[126:25.06]I died.
[126:25.30]No, just...
[126:39.95]Go up there and die, quick.
[126:46.50]Kill me, quick.
[126:48.84]Don't hit the side of the wall.
[126:49.68]Hit me.
[126:51.78]Kill me.
[126:53.54]Just hit me.
[126:56.32]Oh, come on.
[127:04.74]I just gave so many of you guys money.
[127:07.34]We did this wrong from the very beginning.
[127:09.03]Yeah, they're low.
[127:11.07]Alright, but cheese.
[127:16.39]Fifteen fucking thousand dollars.
[127:18.81]Hold on.
[127:21.09]Let's do this again.
[127:21.79]This time, I'm going to make it correct.
[127:25.21]You know, I'm saying.
[127:29.63]Coins earned per minute, max starting coins, let's go with like, let's go 500.
[127:35.57]Well, 512, that's fine coins a minute 50.
[127:39.67]uh enemy settings let's just like you can spawn max bonds per round one and two is fine let's take it down to like six or five for each one hammer hammer hammer jet pack jet pack
[128:08.37]No clones or gifts.
[128:09.63]I don't even know I can't even disable that There's no way for me to disable it Yeah, see I can't uh, I cannot take off that For some reason hold on That's not like built in here See commands by typing command.
[128:30.53]I know that that's commands for you guys um
[128:38.81]Ban anyone that GIFs.
[128:42.95]Alright, we'll try it again with this different strategy here.
[128:45.21]Let's start again.
[128:52.86]Yeah, the GIFs... The GIFs are...
[129:01.67]The GIFs definitely make this not quite... It gets a little overwhelming.
[129:07.67]Clones, clones, clones, clones!
[129:17.30]It doesn't even matter.
[129:19.58]Like I said, Twitch integration is really fun.
[129:22.54]But, by golly, this was never designed for more than, like, a hundred people to be using it.
[129:30.52]Low, low, low!
[129:35.63]I just got full clones.
[129:39.49]Oh shit, I forgot I'm not blocking yet.
[129:43.48]Is there like a leaderboard to see who has the most clones?
[129:49.86]Not the most clones, the most... I'm not going to die on bronze.
[129:56.13]17 grand on bow, huh?
[129:58.87]You guys really are confident that I'm going to die to a bowman.
[130:05.31]Alright, guys.
[130:06.23]Hammer and swords.
[130:07.53]No archers and there goes all your money.
[130:09.33]Alright, we're going, uh... Let's go fire sword.
[130:17.92]My chat's broken again.
[130:18.86]Let's go do actual multiplayer 1v1s.
[130:26.08]That sounds like fun.
[130:33.00]Get the fucking creepers out of here.
[130:36.64]Oh, fuck.
[130:38.78]Alright, so far so good.
[130:47.97]Camera?
[130:49.69]Oh, come on.
[130:50.59]I need to restart my chat.
[130:56.90]My Twitch chat is never designed...
[131:03.49]Pop out my chat again.
[131:08.41]Bald smile.
[131:09.11]Where are you guys getting these emotes?
[131:15.77]Alright, do I have any...
[131:32.46]Fire sword.
[131:33.08]Uh, no, we're getting rid of the clone.
[131:43.56]Alright, here we go.
[131:47.26]Still happening.
[131:49.04]We probably have to wait until next round.
[131:51.96]Here are the armored archers.
[131:53.22]That was a, you know, I understand what's going on here.
[131:56.02]So, you made armored archers, and then you bet on an archer killing you.
[132:00.05]Because you can spawn them.
[132:02.88]I mean, that's pretty smart.
[132:09.61]And it fucking almost worked again, because I almost died.
[132:14.39]There is hope for this human guy!
[132:21.92]What's the hardest enemy in the game?
[132:23.18]I'm surprised I haven't seen it.
[132:32.34]Alright, fire sword 2.
[132:36.62]Alright, next time I die, we're going to do multiplayer.
[132:39.83]There's also a challenge mode too that I want to try.
[132:47.71]Well, there... Okay, well, I asked about it and there it is.
[132:52.32]Disgust.
[133:10.91]Okay, well, there it is.
[133:17.53]Game over.
[133:20.87]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[133:22.55]No more Twitch integration.
[133:26.46]That was an ally.
[133:28.60]Main menu, alright.
[133:31.44]We're gonna do the challenge mode now.
[133:34.50]What about multiplayer?
[133:35.72]How does it work?
[133:37.88]Let me see.
[133:39.42]Multiplayer.
[133:43.21]Duel.
[133:45.07]Oh, Jesus.
[133:46.57]Okay, I just clicked on Duel.
[133:49.17]It's picking the best region.
[133:52.47]So there is just matchmaking in this.
[133:55.25]Interesting.
[133:59.19]Okay.
[134:03.53]So that's it.
[134:05.41]My money is gone.
[134:06.76]It wasn't real.
[134:07.52]Is it just 1v1?
[134:07.98]That's all, huh?
[134:16.69]I wonder if you do different duels?
[134:22.83]Oh, what?
[134:25.45]What?
[134:26.13]An advantage of dying second is the ability to counter your opponent's upgrades.
[134:30.65]Oh.
[134:37.01]That's kind of cool.
[134:39.23]Alright, let's freak him out here.
[134:40.17]Ready?
[134:43.63]Behold, the human robot ball.
[135:08.44]Okay, now he's going to do that too.
[135:09.78]Yeah, I was trying to freak him out.
[135:14.68]To get an advantage.
[135:16.30]Now I'll freak him out here.
[135:17.04]He's going to spawn and I'm going to kill him.
[135:18.94]No, he spawns behind me.
[135:19.74]Where does he spawn?
[135:25.11]On the other side, right?
[135:26.29]Right there.
[135:26.61]1, 2, 3, and... 1, 2, 3...
[135:43.47]Oh fuck, nice job.
[136:01.25]The human was almost dead, then killed all the clones.
[136:04.35]Nice is it.
[136:05.07]One more to go.
[136:08.27]I'm getting open.
[136:09.43]These humans were pretty evenly matched.
[136:11.69]Yes.
[136:12.35]Are we sure they were not the same human?
[136:14.95]No.
[136:15.59]Different.
[136:17.21]I was trying to get over there.
[136:19.39]I was trying to get over to his spawn so I would freak him out and he'd be like, oh shit, he's over here.
[136:23.62]Whatever.
[136:26.54]First matchup I've played.
[136:32.83]Alright, let's do it.
[136:33.89]Dog.
[136:34.03]Nice name.
[136:34.63]Alright.
[136:34.89]Let's do it.
[136:41.53]Don't fall off!
[136:47.05]What the f- Come on, what the fuck was that?
[136:50.36]What was that?
[137:03.57]Does he know I have the bow?
[137:04.35]Probably not.
[137:16.80]I'm like, what the fuck was that?
[137:21.60]Alright, I'm kind of getting fucked here.
[137:23.72]How did I not block that?
[137:29.75]Now I'm getting rid of the sword next time I have a chance.
[137:47.53]Don't shoot arrows at humans who are spawning rude
[138:11.77]Congratulations, human.
[138:13.43]You win the prize.
[138:14.75]What is the prize?
[138:16.03]Fighting other humans in this robot body for eternity.
[138:19.63]I didn't know that was gonna happen.
[138:22.55]How was I supposed to know?
[138:23.63]Yeah, I got what I deserved, but I didn't know that that was a possibility.
[138:33.37]Dishonorable.
[138:35.83]Jump over the spikes.
[138:37.33]Or just stay where you are.
[138:38.61]Alright, do it.
[138:41.91]Spikes.
[138:42.29]I have to jump over the spikes.
[138:51.55]I'm rooting for this human now!
[138:53.41]You can do it!
[138:54.40]Human!
[138:55.16]Damn it!
[138:56.26]Fuck!
[138:56.68]Where did his leg go?
[139:24.22]Lost to a 13 year old.
[139:26.70]That's not true!
[139:27.60]Hey, guess what?
[139:31.42]I know plenty of people that have a 2000 email.
[139:34.24]They're like in their 40s.
[139:39.55]Oh, I see his tactic here.
[139:40.79]He was gonna go with the bow, are you?
[139:42.11]Well, I can't even block it, so why am I doing that?
[139:45.97]What the fuck was that?
[140:00.22]Come here, you little snake!
[140:03.66]Why are these- How am I missing?
[140:06.65]WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL TH- IT'S SACRED!
[140:08.63]THIS IS BULLSHIT!
[140:10.25]THIS WHOLE GAME!
[140:11.23]That doesn't make any- I'm angry!
[140:12.77]I'm actually upset!
[140:16.03]Everyone thinks I'm bad?
[140:17.12]No!
[140:17.42]Where's my hit detection?
[140:20.46]That was unbelievable!
[140:21.44]Ohohoho!
[140:30.72]I don't think I can even hit this guy.
[140:41.44]I'm swinging through his body.
[140:44.44]I can't hit anybody.
[140:46.28]Nobody can get hit.
[140:47.89]I hit him like seven times.
[140:49.25]Pull that bod back.
[140:51.15]My hammer went directly through his head.
[140:54.69]Are you fucking kidding me?
[140:58.46]That was the most broken dumb shit ever.
[141:02.02]You guys can say whatever you want, but you better believe that that was absolute total bullshit.
[141:07.59]I'm running around like Tom and Jerry with this guy.
[141:15.69]I don't understand.
[141:20.67]I don't understand.
[141:21.90]I don't understand.
[141:24.58]Why the fuck?
[141:25.44]Of course.
[141:37.03]I swung through his body like at least four or five times.
[141:43.74]That was just... I don't understand.
[141:46.02]What?
[141:46.14]You're going here?
[142:10.27]Watch out for this.
[142:10.91]I gotta like drop my sensitivity.
[142:26.58]That's another problem.
[142:29.14]One leg down.
[142:30.28]One more to go.
[142:31.60]The human still looks pretty tough.
[142:33.51]Come on, with one leg!
[142:34.55]I gotta get up here.
[142:39.10]I gotta have him use some energy here.
[142:42.34]Because I'm just gonna walk into this and hope he walks in and follows me and dies.
[142:45.94]Right?
[142:46.10]You know what I mean?
[142:46.88]Like, this is a good way to sacrifice myself.
[142:53.51]Ooh, that was close.
[142:56.95]That was close.
[142:58.39]Uh-oh.
[143:00.43]There's the end there.
[143:02.93]Let's go, I'm just gonna go with armor.
[143:09.05]Armor and... I'm not doing fucking hammer again.
[143:11.65]Armor and fire sword.
[143:15.09]Alright, I got the advantage here.
[143:32.17]Actually won a game You West where was that last game against Johnny 2000 Lord taco make sure you bow first
[144:03.33]let's go oh wait wait oh no he okay yeah good yeah let me jump let's go
[144:29.20]I got him right in the knee cap.
[144:30.40]I can't take this music anymore.
[144:31.78]Well, I turned it up.
[144:32.24]People wanted it.
[144:32.68]I'll turn it down.
[144:33.33]Yeah, the hit reg.
[144:33.81]How does it feel to get Johnny 2005'd?
[144:34.71]Alright, he's got armor.
[145:01.45]Ooh, nice.
[145:03.05]Nice, nice, nice, nice.
[145:06.24]I'm gonna also do armor, and I'm gonna do hammer.
[145:08.46]And, like, I'm gonna fucking do it.
[145:10.20]And I'm gonna try it.
[145:11.88]If I get bad hit registration again on this thing, it's going back into the dumpster.
[145:31.14]There it is.
[145:32.82]Oh, nice move, dude!
[145:34.96]Good moves!
[145:37.32]That was... I thought he was dead.
[145:39.16]I didn't know he was... I thought he was dead.
[145:46.65]I actually thought he died.
[145:50.21]Oh, good moves, dude!
[145:57.31]Gotta get him to the left side.
[145:58.29]Or his right.
[146:20.03]Alright, last round.
[146:20.69]Here we go.
[146:22.97]Oh, he's 80-80-ing.
[146:26.48]He's 80-80-ing.
[146:26.94]Let's see what he's gonna come out with.
[146:30.24]I'm gonna say he's gonna probably... I think he's gonna have a bow.
[146:31.84]You know what I'm saying?
[146:35.18]Because if I'm gonna use hammer... Whoa.
[146:45.71]I hit him, but that was very strange.
[146:50.01]Getting a little weird here.
[146:50.85]Good game, man.
[146:57.88]Good game.
[146:59.08]That was fun.
[147:09.73]Hammer is garbage.
[147:10.63]No, hammer is not garbage.
[147:11.73]Only when you play against somebody that you can't hit with the broad side of a battle axe.
[147:21.16]Alright, good.
[147:21.58]US East again.
[147:24.06]When I say this game's worth the $15, um... That really depends.
[147:28.80]Because remember, it's still early access, so... You get an early access game.
[147:34.38]The storyline stops after an hour.
[147:36.57]That...
[147:37.84]I guess this human really wanted more upgrades.
[147:40.12]So the... It stops after an hour.
[147:43.00]And then really, realistically, endless mode and the challenges are really all you got.
[147:47.30]So this probably... I want to say this is probably like 5 hours of... 10 hours of content, maybe?
[147:57.44]Depending on how you look at it.
[147:59.16]Depends on how much you like the modes.
[148:00.85]I'm not jumping over there.
[148:05.21]He's got advantage right now.
[148:14.09]There's workshop support too, that's cool Hey, enjoy this Now I'm now I am at an advantage I
[148:46.63]Can I connect?
[148:53.84]I can't fucking connect!
[148:55.90]Did he fall off again?
[148:58.04]Oh he fell off.
[149:01.24]Don't shoot.
[149:23.67]He's got armor though, this is gonna be bad.
[149:33.89]I wasn't trying to hit you with there on the bow, I promise.
[149:35.50]Alright, I gotta go for it now.
[149:44.14]Woof!
[149:48.19]Well, if you didn't fall off that first time, you probably would have won.
[149:53.10]So, you know, I call that one a draw.
[149:59.80]Dishonor.
[150:00.34]No, I didn't know he was going to start bowing.
[150:06.96]He tried spawn camping.
[150:08.14]He didn't fall.
[150:09.10]Oh.
[150:13.50]You see, if you try to do bad, mean things, you get punished for it.
[150:23.26]Seems like a lot of different areas.
[150:28.08]A lot of potential ways to win and lose here.
[150:43.37]Gotta get the other one.
[150:44.66]Ooh, that didn't hit him.
[150:53.28]No, it was me.
[150:55.91]Well, thank you, Charlie.
[150:56.61]It's fine.
[150:59.21]I'm not trying to spawn kill.
[151:00.13]I'm just trying to jump around on these.
[151:02.65]This goes up even further?
[151:04.55]Not into that.
[151:06.03]Okay.
[151:06.55]Well, I didn't know that's what that did.
[151:08.26]I didn't know that was going to happen to me.
[151:11.44]And whatever.
[151:12.00]I thought it was just a set piece.
[151:17.70]Whatever.
[151:18.04]It's fine.
[151:18.62]Let's get the hammer.
[151:28.82]It probably reminds them of their mind harvest.
[151:31.42]They seem to be we are in the beam That does sound like that.
[151:33.46]We are in the beam Is is that the same thing?
[151:36.76]We are in the beam Is it or was that like an actual guy Alright, here we go Oh close
[152:08.39]Don't touch the beam!
[152:09.49]Don't touch the beam!
[152:17.98]Damn!
[152:19.34]Oh, that was close.
[152:29.34]Yeah, it's the text-to-speech guy.
[152:37.48]Get your free TV.
[152:40.61]I didn't lower my sensitivity.
[152:41.69]No, you're right.
[152:42.75]It dropped by like 10% probably.
[152:46.58]I will do like another two or three of these.
[152:49.82]And then I want to try the challenge mode.
[152:51.56]This game's fun, but... I'm fighting the urge to tell people to buy this for $15.
[152:57.94]Is it $15 or $20?
[153:01.84]But that means it's still going to add stuff.
[153:04.30]Here's how you can tell if you should buy it or not.
[153:08.37]When was the last time they updated the game?
[153:14.71]You want to play that game?
[153:16.21]I'll play that game with you.
[153:21.09]Oops.
[153:22.51]I thought I could... No, whatever.
[153:26.02]An advantage of dying second is the ability to counter your opponent's upgrade.
[153:32.02]I'm going to do Hammer here because there's not really a whole lot of places to run away.
[153:35.64]Yeah, they added Battle Royale.
[153:40.77]Alright.
[153:41.15]Well, if they're actually updating the game, then... I mean, it's actually a very solid game.
[153:47.39]It is.
[153:50.98]Nice.
[153:51.36]Okay.
[153:52.74]I feel you.
[153:53.76]I feel you there.
[153:54.46]That was pretty slick.
[154:05.63]Yeah, I think the game is very good.
[154:10.06]This is a really, really, really fun game.
[154:13.38]If they fill it with content and that story mode is more fleshed out and there's more to do.
[154:18.70]Add some more, maybe add some more items.
[154:22.38]then yes, this game is absolutely worth it.
[154:25.43]This is very, very fun.
[154:31.67]He's going to make me do that too.
[154:32.67]No, I'm not going to do it.
[154:53.38]Okay, apparently neither one- we can't do anything, I guess.
[155:07.53]No, I did it again!
[155:09.49]I'm just rage quit.
[155:10.35]Fuck it, whatever.
[155:30.80]I really thought that was going to work.
[155:41.38]You're trying to kick me off.
[155:42.39]You think I'm stupid?
[155:44.51]I actually connected it.
[155:49.17]EU server.
[155:50.05]Is this EU?
[155:50.45]I think this is West Coast.
[156:13.75]Whoa, what happened?
[156:17.71]Yeah!
[156:18.25]I thought I died.
[156:21.23]I thought he killed me.
[156:25.97]Yeah, the music's not that great.
[156:28.01]But, I mean, it serves its purpose, I think.
[156:33.53]That was EU West.
[156:35.72]It definitely serves its purpose of just kind of being there.
[156:42.48]I like this map.
[156:47.30]What's the ping here?
[156:47.80]42?
[156:47.82]27?
[156:48.12]42?
[156:48.20]Oh, we're good.
[156:50.53]This is a good ping.
[156:56.83]Oh my fucking god!
[156:57.87]I didn't know that- Okay, did you see what happened there?
[157:02.31]You fly if you hold down- Wow.
[157:07.72]Oh, he's- No, you don't have to do that.
[157:08.92]That's my-
[157:14.07]I did not expect to fly like that.
[157:15.99]Okay, keep that in mind.
[157:25.99]Good, good, good, good game.
[157:47.61]going on.
[157:48.69]Let's do that armor.
[157:49.29]Let's do it.
[157:49.73]I'm gonna try for it.
[157:53.65]Let's see if I can get it.
[158:10.99]Oh, he's still alive!
[158:13.90]The human still has one left.
[158:15.74]I should be grateful.
[158:18.10]Alright.
[158:19.44]Well, if he didn't walk off, he would still have the advantage.
[158:24.78]Kick spam.
[158:25.40]Yeah, that's like the sweep in Mortal Kombat.
[158:28.14]The thing is, you can do it in any direction, too.
[158:29.72]So you can go around somebody and then kick them back.
[158:32.26]You don't have to kick forward every time.
[158:34.08]That's pretty interesting stuff.
[158:39.06]Ooh.
[158:43.14]Oh, I'm coming.
[158:45.60]That match killed every possible clone.
[158:48.27]I was trying to be... Good game.
[158:51.17]I was thinking I could like bat kick him into the lava.
[158:55.23]Alright, two more.
[159:00.95]Now I'm going to do challenge mode.
[159:03.35]Can you kick with one leg?
[159:04.21]Probably not.
[159:05.02]I would assume you can.
[159:10.88]You must be proud of your clones.
[159:12.72]Alright, versus why do witches... Me and witches...
[159:19.41]There's a ping on here.
[159:20.41]It's fine.
[159:28.34]Where was my sword?
[159:30.24]Where was my sword?
[159:31.54]Why was my sword not there to block?
[159:44.09]Nobody expects the speed.
[159:47.51]Nobody expects the speed, I'm telling you.
[159:57.30]Armor.
[159:59.46]It's going to be hard to win.
[160:00.32]Damn it.
[160:05.27]Alright.
[160:10.77]What do I need here?
[160:38.91]That was like a scary monster.
[160:40.25]What was I doing?
[160:40.85]I don't know.
[160:41.43]Trying to shoot him with a bow and arrow.
[160:43.39]Close quarters.
[161:03.03]Am I having fun?
[161:04.91]Yeah.
[161:05.87]I think this game's really good.
[161:08.57]Ooh, easy.
[161:12.07]He's gonna... I see what you're doing there.
[161:13.26]He's gonna try to drop down on me.
[161:17.28]Yeah.
[161:17.80]Wow.
[161:18.26]You would've had it too, wouldn't you?
[161:19.50]Almost.
[161:21.16]You almost had it.
[161:22.06]Almost got it.
[161:23.56]That was an interesting play there.
[161:28.05]Speaking of interesting plays, why don't we interesting play him?
[161:32.65]I tried to hit space and it didn't work.
[161:48.74]Oh!
[161:49.22]Did I get him?
[161:52.65]Oh, that's so fun.
[161:54.31]I don't care.
[161:54.65]I'm going to do it again.
[161:55.63]He's chasing me, but it's fine.
[161:57.53]I want to get up there again and do that again.
[161:58.67]That's fun.
[162:04.46]Alright, you ready?
[162:11.08]Almost.
[162:17.14]Three, here we go.
[162:18.06]Two... Yes, bow-bow.
[162:22.96]Oh, fuck!
[162:25.09]Where'd he go?
[162:28.37]It's just like jousting.
[162:39.54]Oh, he got my arm.
[162:41.28]He got the arm.
[162:42.30]He took the arm.
[162:47.18]No, I tried to get there in one jump.
[162:53.36]I probably can't do that.
[162:54.06]I'm going to stay from all the way on the other side.
[162:55.48]Alright, here we go.
[162:59.63]Oh, no.
[163:00.39]He fell.
[163:05.27]I'm going to let you go.
[163:05.89]Okay, well, I'll move out of the way for you to get on that one.
[163:14.47]We hit swords.
[163:17.61]We actually clashed swords there.
[163:24.36]I got one arm.
[163:27.76]He might show up with armor here.
[163:33.23]I could probably try to fuck with him here.
[163:35.15]Let's get over there.
[163:53.68]Watch out for the train.
[163:54.60]Oh!
[164:03.71]Uh-oh, spikes.
[164:11.14]Nice job.
[164:11.50]Alright, now I know what I'm doing.
[164:12.84]I'm going with the hammer here.
[164:21.93]Probably should an armor, but I got I got another chance here.
[164:25.79]Where is he up there?
[164:30.01]We'll play the chase game I Was thinking he was gonna we actually are doing the chase game, aren't we?
[164:42.39]Oh Shit
[164:55.37]Alright, here we go.
[164:57.61]Huge hammer.
[164:58.79]And armor.
[165:00.71]See if we can't seal the deal here.
[165:02.57]Or he might seal the deal on me.
[165:05.11]What?
[165:10.40]Good game, dude.
[165:11.40]Oof.
[165:22.75]smogged yeah get smogged good game dude seriously that was a ton of fun alright let's be the last one that we're gonna go I'm gonna take a piss break and come back and we'll do challenge mode spinning wheel of death I like this level this lovely because you have to you're forced to fight on the one level scary this is final destination something is enough yes it will be interesting to see how the humans behave
[165:48.35]Twitch mode, please.
[165:49.93]Well, we just did it for like 45 minutes and it was just a fucking mess.
[166:01.92]I gotta play aggressive like he does.
[166:03.42]I gotta go in aggressive.
[166:08.94]That's the name of the game here.
[166:24.42]Jesus Christ.
[166:25.58]Why can't I hit him?
[166:30.52]I cannot land a hit on this guy.
[166:37.52]Let's go.
[166:47.52]He's blocking.
[166:48.60]He's actually blocking my side attacks.
[166:50.56]This guy's good.
[167:12.29]Okay.
[167:13.31]I'm at a disadvantage though.
[167:14.79]What does the integration do?
[167:17.55]The integration makes it so you can spawn enemies and bet on matches.
[167:22.10]The only problem is it just turns into chaos after about 30 seconds.
[167:29.74]Fix my armor.
[167:30.34]I can't die.
[167:31.42]I'm on my last life.
[167:32.36]What did he upgrade here then?
[167:35.40]Bow?
[167:35.66]Oh, he got...
[167:39.86]I knew this human would win.
[167:41.68]All the times that I didn't fool me.
[167:43.76]You are so good at analysis.
[167:45.67]Analysis bug.
[167:48.19]Speed.
[167:50.99]Alright.
[167:51.49]Let me just go to the bathroom.
[167:54.47]And I will be right back.
[167:56.13]Then we'll do the challenge mode for a little bit.
[167:57.53]And then we'll be done.
[168:00.02]So see you in a minute.
[170:52.30]Okay.
[170:55.13]So I just want to talk about something else here.
[170:57.99]It's about the emote contest.
[170:59.99]While we have people here and we're just hanging out.
[171:02.98]So the emote contest is the last day for submissions for the emote contest is tomorrow.
[171:11.34]So Sunday, wherever you are, Sunday at like 12 a.m.
[171:15.99]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[171:17.59]Monday at 12.01 a.m.
[171:20.21]So you have until midnight Sunday, tomorrow.
[171:24.40]What's going to happen after that is that I won't be taking submissions anymore.
[171:28.96]And then Tuesday, we're going to vote on them.
[171:32.76]There's going to be a first pass through that I'm going to do and some of the mods.
[171:36.66]We're going to do just one pass through to try to chew it down a little bit.
[171:42.28]And then there's going to be like a final, I'd say like a final 10 to 20, depending on how many there are, right?
[171:52.71]And then we're going to vote for them on stream.
[171:56.07]And we'll figure it out from there.
[171:57.55]So you'll see how that's going to play out.
[172:00.37]There'll be five that are picked.
[172:03.49]And that's it.
[172:03.91]If you have no idea what's going on, if you have absolutely no clue what I'm talking about, my last like five emote slots or whatever I have, I want to keep like a couple open just in case I have like a dumb idea that I want to do.
[172:22.93]We're doing an emote contest.
[172:23.95]If you go to my Discord and you want to put a submission in, you have until tomorrow night to put in an emote.
[172:31.59]There's rules there if you want to check it out.
[172:34.23]By all means, go to that section.
[172:37.06]But we're going to do the challenges.
[172:39.10]Okay, here we go.
[172:41.76]There are workshop challenges too.
[172:43.18]That's cool.
[172:43.78]Inferno, 10 brutally hard levels that will set you on fire.
[172:51.02]Great sword challenge, practice offline with the majestic sword of multiplayer.
[172:56.85]Let's start, if we get flame breath we should be able to.
[173:06.51]This is kind of like Binding of Isaac.
[173:13.25]Not really, but same kind of, you just have to beat a certain thing with a certain build and a certain person at a certain time.
[173:22.04]See if we can just screw through this.
[173:23.74]Rogue-like.
[173:24.68]I wonder how it's going to get any more difficult.
[173:27.02]Let's do... Let's do block arrows because that's always very necessary.
[173:31.10]He said Jax?
[173:32.24]Did he?
[173:50.37]Go Jax.
[173:52.22]Oh, Jesus.
[173:55.12]Now I know why this is hard.
[173:56.69]I can just get them killed.
[173:58.69]Because they'll die from it too.
[174:15.65]How many people left?
[174:16.35]One last guy?
[174:16.87]Oh, he's stuck in the corner.
[174:18.53]Come on, get out.
[174:20.31]There it is.
[174:24.41]I'm gonna do... I'm gonna do a clone this time.
[174:26.61]We decided to improve it.
[174:28.21]Play smart, not hard.
[174:28.85]That's right.
[174:29.37]Play smarter, not harder.
[174:30.71]Then several years to teach it how to do things.
[174:44.51]I'm gonna get up there quick, just in case somebody spawns behind me, which they very well could.
[174:48.83]No, that's why I got the upgrade arrow thing.
[174:51.55]There it is.
[175:02.67]Oh, you jumped over it, asshole.
[175:08.27]He's dead, alright.
[175:10.85]Is he gonna shoot?
[175:13.46]Apparently not.
[175:15.46]Come on.
[175:17.39]Goodbye.
[175:19.85]Last guy.
[175:20.41]Watch out for the Mario level thing.
[175:22.77]I will get killed by that.
[175:23.77]I'm certain of it.
[175:24.75]I'm not a moron.
[175:26.57]And this dude is just here.
[175:29.87]What happened?
[175:32.92]Wait, what?
[175:34.68]Oh, god damn it.
[175:36.26]What?
[175:36.44]What?
[175:45.01]Apparently that happens every quarter of a second.
[175:47.13]What?
[175:47.49]One... Two... I don't understand.
[175:52.53]Whatever.
[175:54.77]Let's go.
[175:55.77]I am impressed completely voluntarily.
[175:58.44]We got 50 bucks here.
[176:01.60]Hold on.
[176:01.92]$50 from Ace McLace.
[176:02.88]Thanks for the 50 bucks, dude.
[176:12.18]That's a lot of money.
[176:12.90]Hey Jerma, that dog get fucked edition guy was me.
[176:16.08]Sometimes I forgot the actual word fuck is in my name.
[176:19.77]Thanks for cutting my head off.
[176:20.77]That was fun.
[176:21.53]I was excited to see the game get attention.
[176:24.53]Glad you're enjoying it.
[176:26.72]Yeah.
[176:28.72]This game is very fun.
[176:30.08]But like I said before, obviously this is not necessarily a criticism of the game itself, but by the time this stream is over, we will have seen literally all the game has to offer.
[176:42.60]Which is about three to four hours worth of content.
[176:46.84]Now you can do endless mode until your eyes bleed, but in-game content to do?
[176:52.75]It's about three and a half hours, I would say.
[176:54.81]Maybe a little bit more.
[176:57.49]I think it's fun.
[177:04.43]I'm just gonna do clone again.
[177:05.43]I'm just trying not to die.
[177:06.47]What?
[177:06.77]What's the matter?
[177:07.86]Why are you guys freaking out?
[177:09.64]Oh, this is bad.
[177:10.18]Bone arrows.
[177:38.38]Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.
[177:45.90]But no, really, thanks so much, AceMcLace.
[177:49.26]Pleasure to play.
[177:51.50]By the way, this is not the thing... Everyone that was curious, let me touch upon this.
[177:54.98]This is not the thing I was talking about.
[177:58.86]When I said the thing with you guys interacting.
[178:01.34]Not even close.
[178:02.50]That's nothing to do with the video game.
[178:03.70]I'd say I'm going to do...
[178:11.62]Fire sword Then what is the thing it's a thing that I'm currently working on and I hope I can get it ready in the next week I'm trying my behind off I Gotta get rid of these guys now
[178:46.62]He's dead?
[178:47.38]Okay, now it's just these idiots.
[178:48.42]Alright, almost there.
[178:54.56]Five out of ten.
[178:55.93]Hydrate.
[178:56.63]Okay.
[178:56.75]That's some good hydration.
[178:57.81]This is water and milk, right?
[178:58.75]It's like half cow vitamins and the other half is water?
[179:22.64]I'm not drinking milk.
[179:27.56]Not drinking milk.
[179:29.77]Easy.
[179:31.21]Oh, well.
[179:31.91]That's the thing that's going on right now.
[179:34.95]Magically, I'm alive.
[179:36.29]We have to move.
[179:40.79]Very clever.
[179:41.31]Almost had me there, game.
[179:46.05]That's not vegan.
[179:49.24]No, it isn't.
[179:52.26]Go.
[180:05.58]We really kind of wish I had the bow now.
[180:16.32]Don't you dare.
[180:18.64]Stupid spider bombs.
[180:24.05]Stop!
[180:25.21]Enough!
[180:25.63]Jesus Christ, I can't even move.
[180:34.99]The milk is... Alright, I can't get knocked off.
[180:45.10]You gotta go now.
[180:46.28]Watch out.
[180:53.77]Oh, fuck you.
[180:54.65]Get... Oh, come on!
[180:56.83]Oh, come on, man.
[180:58.25]Fuck that.
[181:00.41]Fuck that.
[181:01.29]Fuck that.
[181:02.69]Give me a break.
[181:05.04]Ah, that hurts.
[181:06.88]Let's see what the other one is.
[181:10.27]Happy construction day.
[181:11.89]Can you beat level 20?
[181:12.71]Let's just beat 20.
[181:15.45]Can you reach titanium using only the bow?
[181:17.33]Use only the hammer.
[181:20.67]Everyone's armored.
[181:22.47]Can I kick myself to 10 levels?
[181:24.48]Flame Raptor's insanely hard version.
[181:32.02]Power kick.
[181:32.80]Yeah.
[181:34.22]It's all kind of the same thing.
[181:35.40]You just have to only use one item.
[181:36.92]Random upgrade challenge.
[181:38.26]Let's try the kick.
[181:42.04]That's all I can do, right?
[181:45.00]I can't even buy a clone.
[181:47.16]No, I got nothing.
[181:48.60]I just have to beat him.
[182:04.25]Do I just have to kick the shit out of him?
[182:06.41]Will eventually he die?
[182:07.21]No, I gotta get him in the spikes.
[182:12.85]Fuck.
[182:13.07]All righty, let's do it again.
[182:19.19]Only environmental kills.
[182:23.49]I'd beat this in five minutes if I had legs.
[182:36.14]Come here.
[182:41.78]Well, I guess that didn't count.
[182:44.07]I didn't kick him.
[182:45.17]One robot down.
[182:46.49]Many more to kick.
[182:50.05]Sorry, you did not kick.
[182:52.00]Challenge ended.
[182:58.19]So can I not do anything?
[183:01.15]Well, I guess I can do this.
[183:04.68]Let's go with the... Let's go with the clone here.
[183:15.98]Play the Twitch mode or chat's gonna riot.
[183:17.84]Well, they already played it.
[183:20.68]We already did it.
[183:21.74]Oh, Jesus.
[183:22.44]They all gotta go in the hole.
[183:29.67]I guess I can't just walk them around.
[183:30.95]Okay, they're really, really stupid, so that's easy.
[183:34.10]Okay.
[183:35.34]Not as hard as I thought it was going to be.
[183:39.66]Uh, maybe armor?
[183:41.72]I'm going to say armor.
[183:44.32]Armor or... Yeah, armor.
[183:46.82]Feels safer like this.
[184:01.72]Level three.
[184:02.06]What if the slow-mo didn't actually slow the frames?
[184:09.27]Yeah, that's... Hold on a minute here.
[184:11.79]Oh, no.
[184:13.07]Whoa!
[184:14.15]You didn't tell me that we could... Shoot them with the bows, please.
[184:25.66]Fall off.
[184:26.32]Fall off the edge.
[184:27.42]Fall off the edge.
[184:30.10]Good.
[184:35.49]Shit.
[184:37.51]This is not... Don't make this one easy.
[184:41.67]Oh, fuck, man.
[184:42.99]That's... If I bounced off of him.
[184:46.12]Ay-yi-yi.
[184:50.10]Bounce back when you kick him.
[184:54.86]Well, need another clone now.
[184:56.26]I hope I don't lose this.
[184:57.34]Are you gonna...
[185:07.66]Do you see that little bounce?
[185:12.42]Shoot it.
[185:12.62]Give me a clone.
[185:16.14]I almost fell off again.
[185:19.62]Sin's Fortress.
[185:21.42]Does feel like it, don't it?
[185:36.87]Let's get a clone again.
[185:43.41]Warm?
[185:43.91]Nearly all you can do.
[185:47.15]I mean, the whole get up thing... I guess they're for the grenade spiders?
[185:52.11]I should play Overgrowth.
[185:54.95]Isn't Overgrowth that game that's been in alpha for like seven fucking years?
[186:00.45]That's the game I'm thinking of, right?
[186:01.49]Where you play as rabbits and the game's been in development since like I was 19.
[186:15.36]Damn it, he cut my fucking head off.
[186:17.02]I'm just trying to lead him around.
[186:17.96]Alright, I can't lose this.
[186:24.84]It was finished like a year ago.
[186:26.98]It came out and it has two hours of content.
[186:30.14]Is it, really?
[186:32.06]I'm in deep shit here though.
[186:34.08]This is a bad spot to be in.
[186:38.30]Now this fucking, Jesus Christ!
[186:55.47]Close.
[186:56.19]Getting another clone.
[187:01.09]I used to play this online a lot more when the update released.
[187:07.22]Burnt out now.
[187:08.06]They're adding a battle royale mode.
[187:14.60]I don't know how good that's gonna be, but... Oh, you mean overgrade the fight.
[187:25.04]I'm just gonna have to keep doing the clones.
[187:30.08]Although I can't die.
[187:31.90]It's a five out of ten.
[187:35.60]I have to get through two or three of these without dying.
[187:37.50]Oh shit.
[187:41.00]How am I gonna kick these things to death?
[187:44.80]How do I kick the spiders to death?
[187:46.10]Do I have to kick them off into the fire?
[187:49.56]Into the flames?
[187:52.26]I would have to assume that's what I have to do, right?
[187:55.01]Into the spikes?
[187:56.41]There's spikes right here.
[187:57.17]I think it worked.
[188:04.42]I don't know though, I could... I'm dead.
[188:07.14]Thank god he skied by me like a moron.
[188:10.40]Holy shit.
[188:18.09]Come on, how did that not kill him?
[188:20.05]Step on it!
[188:21.15]Oh, you fucking asshole!
[188:29.14]Why did the geyser not turn on?
[188:30.72]And why did he not die from the spikes?
[188:35.99]I seriously have to kick that spider over a geyser.
[188:38.01]That was a pain in the ass.
[189:09.12]Over the geyser boom Thank God One down how many more not you please not you not you not you no
[189:30.51]No, no, no.
[189:39.02]Alright, let's try this one.
[189:47.28]Rage quit.
[189:47.64]I'm not doing that again.
[189:48.32]I like watching great swords.
[189:50.00]Yes, the swing is slower, but has more room.
[189:54.62]I'm not sure what this one's supposed to be though.
[189:56.52]114 beat 14 levels, I guess.
[189:57.48]Alright, well let's keep going.
[189:58.36]Does my mom know that I'm a full time Wizard101 streamer?
[190:07.64]Yeah.
[190:08.16]She has a character too.
[190:25.49]Oh, I just can't do... I have to do Fire Sword only, I guess.
[190:30.73]Can't do the other stuff.
[190:38.00]What's her name?
[190:40.38]You don't need to know.
[190:46.10]Can I speedrun through this whole thing?
[190:49.52]What magic school is she?
[190:50.44]She is Earth.
[190:51.68]You look good in pink.
[190:53.00]Hey, thanks.
[190:53.44]The whole thing.
[190:54.91]A couple of sword guys.
[191:24.16]That guy's still alive.
[191:26.10]I don't have the block, so don't even try it.
[191:33.96]What's with the rapid fire?
[191:34.78]Just do that.
[191:35.18]Did I play Pirate 101?
[191:36.66]We played the Pirates of the Caribbean fan remake.
[191:37.84]That's it though.
[191:38.82]Let's do armor.
[191:57.95]What am I getting for this?
[191:58.65]Just a trophy?
[191:59.65]If I get all the way up to the end?
[192:02.26]I tried Toontown rewritten.
[192:03.44]It just didn't work on my computer.
[192:04.54]I just couldn't get it to work.
[192:12.00]Oh my fucking god.
[192:13.57]I'm... Fucking Toontown.
[192:19.95]Alright, I need to pay attention to the game.
[192:39.63]Why am I so bad at this game?
[192:42.11]Um... This game's hard.
[192:46.63]This game's not easy.
[192:49.39]Dying in one hit.
[192:51.76]Slapstick!
[192:52.58]Um...
[193:13.68]He's trying to die.
[193:18.00]Why am I still playing this game?
[193:19.76]Because I like this game.
[193:21.36]Do we need another reason?
[193:24.10]Do I have to have another reason besides that I like playing this game?
[193:28.56]I'm not sure.
[193:31.02]You tell me.
[193:36.77]Take his head off.
[193:43.91]Get another clone after this, please.
[193:48.63]The other reason is money.
[193:50.85]Money from where?
[193:52.37]From you guys?
[193:53.81]That's the only place it's coming from.
[194:04.50]Sure.
[194:12.43]Give me a clone.
[194:14.19]Clone created.
[194:16.97]Great!
[194:22.02]Fun must be motivated by money.
[194:23.48]Only logical conclusion.
[194:27.48]Logical.
[194:28.50]The only logical scenario.
[194:31.96]Oh fuck.
[194:34.40]Oh my god, he can climb up here.
[194:35.76]Oh, they can all climb up here.
[194:38.37]What am I thinking?
[194:54.05]Okay.
[195:05.69]I didn't get him.
[195:06.89]This is bad.
[195:07.44]I gotta go from the other side.
[195:09.48]I'm gonna get picked off.
[195:10.52]I know it.
[195:12.12]Okay.
[195:12.64]Now I should be able to get you.
[195:19.70]Yeah.
[195:21.06]There you go.
[195:23.29]See ya.
[195:29.71]What am I at now?
[195:30.57]Seven?
[195:31.83]Six?
[195:32.75]What was my very first stream?
[195:37.40]It was Sorcery, was it not?
[195:40.22]I think it was... Was it Overwatch or Sorcery?
[195:42.24]I don't remember.
[195:42.70]I don't remember.
[195:45.52]Oh, I got one clone already.
[195:47.92]Let's go with a better... I want to have more control over the arrows here.
[195:53.35]Was it World of Warcraft?
[195:54.27]No, I don't think it was.
[195:57.33]Diablo 3?
[196:02.85]The robots are not made of gold.
[196:04.99]Two down.
[196:08.03]Clear about quick.
[196:11.07]Alright, alright.
[196:16.59]Okay.
[196:17.65]Smooth.
[196:18.19]Still got a clone.
[196:19.61]It was Armikrog.
[196:21.58]Was it Armikrog?
[196:30.50]It really might have been.
[196:31.66]No, I don't think it was.
[196:32.68]I remember announcing on stream that I was going to play Army Crog on stream.
[196:37.88]Now we got spiders.
[196:38.68]I might need a bow.
[196:41.07]Oh, this is bad.
[196:41.77]I'm going to do armor here.
[196:45.37]I just have to get over.
[196:46.39]Yeah, I'm going to have to fight.
[196:47.57]This is not going to be good.
[196:49.31]This is not going to be good.
[196:56.98]Got to kill the spider right now.
[197:02.84]Good thing I jumped.
[197:03.90]That would have taken my head off.
[197:06.63]Hey, thanks, actually.
[197:07.93]You keep doing that.
[197:08.81]You keep doing that.
[197:09.61]That sounds like a fun time.
[197:11.43]Do that again.
[197:20.51]Thanks for the help.
[197:22.23]I should not have killed that first.
[197:26.05]No, I'm not turning Twitch mode back on.
[197:28.41]Twitch mode is over.
[197:29.17]We're not doing it again.
[197:31.38]We ain't doing it again.
[197:32.38]Twitch mode is not going back on.
[197:45.87]You didn't get to participate in Twitch mode?
[197:47.53]Well, I'm sorry, but we did it for as long as anybody could handle it.
[197:51.81]Next fire sword.
[198:02.34]Angry baby!
[198:07.18]Now I do want to get rid of you first.
[198:12.34]You can limit the spawns?
[198:13.69]Yeah, but here's the thing about the Twitch mode that I don't like.
[198:16.91]People can just put gifts in front of me and spawn allies and pretty much make it impossible for me to lose work.
[198:25.93]I can't turn that off.
[198:27.07]That has to stay on.
[198:28.45]There's no way to turn that off.
[198:31.27]Holy shit, those spikes just saved my life.
[198:39.97]They can also make it impossible.
[198:41.11]Yeah, but you saw what happened when it was on for the 40 minutes it was on.
[198:48.43]There was like 50 gifts in front of me and it was like, armor, free health, clones, five clones.
[198:58.13]What do those do?
[199:01.41]We promise we'll kill you.
[199:04.43]It was fun.
[199:05.13]We were going to be doing more of the same shit.
[199:12.02]But it's funny when you dance for us.
[199:16.50]I'm sure it is.
[199:20.64]Where's the last guy?
[199:23.54]The boat?
[199:24.34]Oh.
[199:25.02]Speaking of having fun.
[199:29.08]Ugh.
[199:31.23]Do not shoot me in the ear.
[199:33.09]Victory.
[199:35.05]So much death and destruction.
[199:36.93]A beautiful display.
[199:37.99]I'm almost done with this one.
[199:43.16]I wonder if I can keep it going.
[199:46.98]Is it time for me to die yet?
[199:49.06]This level might do it.
[199:50.66]It was a good run.
[199:53.74]Uh, what's left?
[199:55.38]Could just repair, do armor, clone.
[199:57.27]I could put another clone up there.
[200:00.31]Yeah, I might as well.
[200:02.05]Clown created.
[200:03.95]You are privileged human.
[200:05.53]Normally backups take hours.
[200:07.83]Jetpack.
[200:08.53]I haven't really had a need for it yet.
[200:10.65]I have two lives.
[200:12.47]If I need it, I can use it.
[200:15.75]That was an interesting fake out you tried to pull on me.
[200:25.71]Thank you for that.
[200:27.21]No, don't thank you for that.
[200:30.40]No spikes right here.
[200:31.24]Wow.
[200:31.96]Did not die.
[200:37.26]Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[200:39.80]What the fuck?
[200:41.94]It was like a magnet to my head.
[200:44.72]Oh, come on.
[200:47.51]Fuck off.
[201:07.15]I'm this far ahead here.
[201:08.05]I don't want to die here and lose.
[201:09.29]Let's steal the clone.
[201:10.17]We're doing armor.
[201:10.97]Kick bots?
[201:11.59]Nah, just give me armor.
[201:12.65]Put it back on.
[201:36.31]I need to fight the hardest boss?
[201:37.63]I already did.
[201:39.91]I fought the guy that shoots the lasers out of his body?
[201:43.02]Yes.
[201:43.88]I killed him twice.
[201:46.58]He was at the very end of the storyline mode.
[201:49.68]And somebody spawned him, I think.
[201:51.36]He was in this other mode.
[201:55.66]Already got him.
[201:56.26]Turned into a Roblox streamer.
[202:05.89]This is not Roblox.
[202:07.56]Flame Raptors.
[202:08.96]Get the jetpack.
[202:13.36]You spawned a friendly overseer and it killed me.
[202:16.14]How much was it to spawn that thing?
[202:18.44]Like $5,000?
[202:24.28]Just these guys?
[202:25.34]Oh boy.
[202:26.08]Actually, this is gonna suck.
[202:37.25]Okay, well, that worked.
[202:40.78]Oh god, that was so loud!
[202:43.38]Does it have to be so loud?
[202:54.59]Turn the volume up.
[202:59.09]No.
[202:59.27]Two more.
[202:59.96]We're gonna go against Dr. Egghead.
[203:05.50]Spider-tron.
[203:06.50]What do we got?
[203:08.50]Block arrows.
[203:09.56]Jetpack.
[203:10.54]No bow allowed.
[203:11.36]Um... How does this do faster?
[203:18.35]And then... If I live through this, we're gonna do energy upgrade.
[203:34.35]Try to get here quick.
[203:35.63]Kill the spider.
[203:37.05]Goodbye!
[203:39.05]Alright, who wants to fuck around now?
[203:40.44]Right into the spikes.
[203:47.18]And you.
[203:51.63]It's that easy.
[203:53.65]At least I hope it is.
[203:55.71]I could blow this right now.
[204:05.64]Jesus.
[204:13.64]Fuck me.
[204:15.94]God damn.
[204:23.81]Oh, you fucker.
[204:29.65]Last level.
[204:31.17]Deflect them.
[204:34.01]I don't have the ability to deflect it back to them.
[204:37.47]If I am lower than them, it does not go up.
[204:39.37]And just get some energy.
[204:40.73]Yeah, I need this upgrade here.
[204:42.28]This one.
[204:54.51]this just blocks it and goes wherever it goes this is the one where you whoever you love wherever you're looking it'll deflect too this is it alright let's go right for the dinosaur well I apparently made something happen there that's good cool
[205:23.23]Well, that was an explosion.
[205:25.28]And that's... should be it.
[205:26.78]One more and that's it.
[205:28.98]Don't die here, this fucking random dude.
[205:33.84]Challenge complete!

[205:38.47]Keep playing.
[205:38.95]I can keep going?
[205:55.65]What's the next level?
[205:57.35]I think I unlocked something in the tree, don't I?
[205:59.55]Or maybe I think there's only specific ones.
[206:00.85]Oh yeah, we just keep going.
[206:01.87]Well, might as well... Just do this and see what happens.
[206:04.01]Titanium.
[206:23.30]Okay.
[206:26.94]Well, that's how that happens.
[206:30.72]Goodbye.
[206:31.66]That was fun.
[206:33.05]Pull them all in here.
[206:33.83]I wonder if I can just not move.
[206:41.89]And win.
[206:47.56]That was so close to winning.
[206:50.08]It was very close.
[206:51.08]If that guy had killed him, that would have been great.
[206:54.06]Advanced AI.
[206:58.86]Alright, last thing I want to check out.
[207:02.45]Level Editor.
[207:02.91]Okay, this is interesting.
[207:09.39]Basics.
[207:10.67]Cube.
[207:53.46]This is actually kind of cool.
[207:54.24]Let's go to spawns.
[208:05.95]Spawn layout.
[208:07.41]Just add another one, right?
[208:08.53]Can I?
[208:08.77]You can do AI trigger area.
[208:17.57]You can make your own game modes in this shit.
[208:22.06]That's kind of cool.
[208:26.79]Where's test?
[208:32.61]Is it workshop content too?
[208:33.55]We'll look at that in a minute.
[208:45.38]That's cool.
[208:46.36]Actually, I will get some community maps.
[208:48.28]That sounds like fun.

[209:29.26]Okay, so we already may have been seeing workshop content in endless mode.
[209:35.62]Oh, here, see.
[209:38.88]See in the settings.
[209:40.16]Endless levels, both workshop and maybe only workshop.

[209:45.07]Okay.
[209:48.79]Whoops, no.
[209:50.95]I did not mean to do that in here.
[209:54.67]Okay.
[209:56.27]Challenge levels.
[209:57.34]Let's see.
[209:57.72]Let's get some weird ones.
[210:02.08]Attack on Titan.
[210:07.04]Business bot challenge.
[210:09.92]Should I get Attack on Titan?
[210:11.19]Alright.
[210:12.11]I'm getting Attack on Titan.
[210:15.51]Has been added.
[210:19.17]Can you survive this?
[210:23.91]I like the, you know, it's just one of those impossible levels.
[210:28.98]Business Bot Challenge.
[210:30.18]What else is there?
[210:36.08]Flame Inferno.
[210:37.78]What about this one?
[210:39.80]Alright, let's try these ones.
[210:47.12]So how do I play them?
[210:54.29]I might have to restart the game maybe they're like in here I don't think so I might just have to be in patrice cabrera I'll go back oh yeah maybe yeah you're right probably is challenge mode
[211:20.09]Workshop challenges, here we go.
[211:21.47]Can you survive?
[211:23.59]And attack on, okay, Attack on Titan.
[211:26.11]So I got, you have automatic upgrades?
[211:32.67]Attack on Titan.
[211:47.63]Alright, I can like slide around.
[211:49.23]This is just spiteful.
[211:53.65]And they don't kill each other.
[211:55.18]Alright, I can beat attack on time.
[211:59.64]I think the game crashed.
[212:08.93]Extremely accurate.
[212:10.41]Try it again.
[212:22.21]I just have to ski around.
[212:23.27]That's all.
[212:23.63]Just watch the depth.
[212:29.96]Just like in the TV show.
[212:35.44]Um.
[212:37.86]Gotta go for the necks?
[212:38.90]I can't reach the necks.
[212:43.65]Alright.
[212:46.33]I'm gonna try this one more time.
[212:48.95]And we're just gonna ski around to try to get out.
[212:58.18]Just move around fast.
[212:59.76]Just hug the edges.
[213:00.70]Go through the middle every so often.
[213:02.90]Keep going in a circle and you'll be fine.
[213:09.29]Nope, you're not fine.
[213:18.35]No way.
[213:19.57]I'm out.
[213:23.27]I'm gonna try the other one.
[213:25.55]Alright, let's try this one.
[213:36.24]This one is, can you survive?
[213:38.98]They all have the Mario Maker names too.
[213:44.06]Like you will not survive.
[213:45.86]You think you are top human?
[213:48.51]You guys are all allies.
[213:55.14]Big war.
[214:02.46]This is a monster fight.
[214:07.29]This is so stupid.
[214:10.79]Cut the tail.
[214:11.35]Is this supposed to be like a TV show or something?
[214:23.65]I think we won.
[214:24.95]What do I get for doing this?
[214:28.25]I beat it.
[214:28.59]Congratulations, you won the level.
[214:31.91]I think there's more.
[214:34.88]Not everything has to be a TV show.
[214:38.88]Oh, I have everything.
[214:42.22]How do I do flame breath?
[214:44.50]Fire hammer?
[214:47.28]Oh, I got the cheats.
[214:47.92]I don't even have to do anything.
[214:49.10]What's the other thing?
[214:51.22]How do I do flame breath?
[214:58.47]Like that.
[215:01.54]Well, okay, that's cool.
[215:06.82]We're doing it again.
[215:08.18]Same scenario.
[215:09.34]I think it's just the same thing.
[215:16.79]Okay, we're done.
[215:27.54]go.
[215:28.46]There's a clone drone in the danger zone.
[215:34.66]Let's see who made this game.
[215:37.27]Eric, John, Brian, Dana, Alice, and Matt.
[215:41.57]Good work.
[215:44.77]And we're probably going to call it here.
[215:49.12]So by the way, get your submissions in for the email contest tomorrow.
[215:53.38]Tomorrow.
[215:58.38]And then Tuesday we're going to vote.
[216:01.26]I'll be live again.
[216:02.75]I will be live again.
[216:06.98]Not tomorrow.
[216:08.36]Monday.
[216:08.70]We're going to go Monday and then Tuesday.
[216:11.56]Tuesday stream is going to be the reason why I'm streaming on Monday and then Tuesday.
[216:16.37]Because Monday we're going to play.
[216:18.59]We have Hold Fast, which is like 150 person.
[216:22.67]Like French Revolution, British soldier game where you can get like 100 people on a boat.
[216:27.24]It seems fucking hysterical.
[216:30.30]There's also that.
[216:30.90]There's this Wreckfest.
[216:32.00]There's another thing that people want a lot of requests to play it.
[216:35.47]There's the funny LUL game.
[216:38.77]There's the funny Laugh Out Loud game.
[216:40.47]Totally accurate battlegrounds.
[216:43.21]We still have Destroy All Humans 2.
[216:44.83]We still have the other stream that I want to do that has nothing to do with any of this.
[216:51.04]But thanks for sticking around.
[216:52.80]This was a lot of fun.
[216:55.75]Depending on how much more content they put in this game, I feel like it's going to be very, very good.
[217:00.29]So, enjoy it while you can.
[217:03.79]That was a pretty fun experience.
[217:05.31]About four hours of on-stream content.
[217:08.13]If you really want to do all the challenges, obviously that's more.
[217:11.57]So, I will see you guys on Monday.
[217:13.53]No, yes I will.
[217:14.51]I'll see you on Monday.
[217:16.68]And then we're going to... By the way, what I was trying to say there is Tuesday's stream, because we're doing two days in a row, is just going to be like an IRL hangout and vote for the emotes stream.
[217:26.52]We're not going to do very much else on Tuesday.
[217:30.03]So with that, let's do the credits.
[217:31.71]Thank you all again for watching, and thank you to those of you that participated in playing this game.
[217:36.57]A lot of fun.
[217:39.05]And why don't we roll those credits?
[217:40.45]Roll that beautiful bean footage.
[217:47.39]Thank you to all the new subs and the old subs.

[220:29.57]Barf, puke, whatever.
[220:32.67]And let's get to the bits.
[220:33.73]Thank you everybody for your subscriptions.
[220:39.39]Jeremiah is so scared to accidentally read something rude.
[220:43.73]Let's mute this for a second because that is a fear.
[220:47.33]You understand?
[220:48.67]If I just remember all lowercase, there's no punctuation, no capitals.
[220:54.49]I could just be like, say something fucking terrible.
[220:57.73]I got to make sure I'm careful.
[221:00.37]So sometimes, you know, it is kind of scary.
[221:04.62]Back to the music.
[221:09.66]Mike wrote.
[221:10.56]Yeah, sometimes I accidentally do that too.
[221:12.78]But that's fine.
[221:14.16]Haha, he said he he he.
[221:15.17]He said turd.
[221:17.61]It wasn't funny.
[221:18.67]I don't think it was funny.
[221:20.69]It's okay if you thought it was though.
[221:21.85]Alright, let's do the bits.
[221:24.51]Um... So... Why am I only getting this many?
[221:31.09]Why is Streamlabs not going further back?
[221:33.53]Did this last time too.
[221:37.19]The stream didn't turn off or anything, did it?
[221:41.33]Now the stream's been on for, like, four hours.
[221:43.78]Alright, well, hopefully this is going back as far as it can.
[221:52.92]Because... Oh, this makes no sense.
[221:57.27]From four hours ago?
[221:58.41]The stream's not even been live for four hours.
[222:00.41]This is weird.
[222:02.40]Well, anyways, thank you, uh, thank you, Elin321 for the $1.
[222:06.43]Where's Jerma vs. Star Part 4?
[222:08.09]Uh, well, Jerma vs. Star Part 3 was, like, three years ago.
[222:14.47]I don't know if there'll be a sequel.
[222:16.49]It was a long time ago.
[222:18.49]That was a long time ago.
[222:20.43]Who knows?
[222:20.73]There might be another one.
[222:21.87]You might see another one.
[222:24.45]Hey, UpwardDig, thanks for the $1.
[222:27.38]With the glass ceiling broken, all the groups shall prosper, including the most oppressed group, gamers.
[222:34.08]You're quoting the video.
[222:35.89]That video that we saw before.
[222:38.75]Hey, Niall Arian, thanks for the $1.
[222:40.33]The fact that you laughed at Bronze V made my day.
[222:45.27]I mean, it's there, right?
[222:46.09]You gotta laugh at that.
[222:48.37]Niall Arian, again, thanks for the $1.
[222:49.81]If you played League, what role or lane would you see yourself playing?
[222:55.33]Um...
[222:57.68]Honestly, I mean, I used to play Smite all the time.
[223:02.06]So, that's... I mean, it's a very similar game, and it plays very similarly.
[223:08.10]And I would usually play solo lane.
[223:14.05]So, solo lane was good, but solo lane was really easy.
[223:17.61]You just had to not die the whole game until you got to the mid to late game.
[223:22.77]You just have to survive in your lane, and then rotate sometimes, like, 30 minutes into the game.
[223:29.39]I liked solo lane, it was really relaxing.
[223:31.93]You just lane with somebody.
[223:35.87]But, thank you, Niall.
[223:37.45]Thank you, Milkshake, for the one dollar!
[223:42.06]Hey, Jerma, I took your advice on getting better at Quake Champions.
[223:49.44]Wait.
[223:51.32]Wait, did you actually do this?
[223:53.41]You didn't actually do this, did you?
[224:01.33]You actually did it.
[224:02.25]Okay, so before the stream started, somebody asked me how to get better at Quake and how to aim higher and get better at air shots.
[224:08.73]And I told him to go outside and throw a frisbee and then try to hit the frisbee with a baseball.
[224:14.11]And he just linked me a video of him doing it.
[224:19.42]So let's take a look.
[224:20.56]Let's watch it.
[224:25.96]uh there you go I mean that's not far enough though that guy he that guy's not okay when you get when you get an air shot with a guy he's not right in your face you're gonna throw that frisbee deep into your backyard and then like whip the baseball into it from like at least a quarter of a mile away make sure you're in a place where this is not gonna be dangerous
[224:56.45]You know, Frisbee goes out, it's floating up there, and you have to... Crow hop, crow hop, crow hop!
[225:02.99]Gun it!
[225:04.33]Bang!
[225:04.99]The ball's gonna be in the air for about at least three or four seconds.
[225:12.19]You know, you gotta start somewhere, though.
[225:14.29]That's a good first start.
[225:16.69]What do I think about the Coke and the thumbnail?
[225:18.35]I don't know, I don't drink that shit.
[225:25.54]Congratulations on your first, uh, air shot in real life.
[225:28.49]Good work.
[225:29.11]Good work.
[225:29.81]Thank you, uh, little... Little Siberian for the... That's not enough money!
[225:45.70]It's not enough money!
[225:49.31]Somebody clip it.
[225:50.85]Oh, great.
[225:52.33]Thank you guys.
[225:53.01]Thank you Byte1223 for the one dollar.
[225:57.69]Here, let me help with that cheer progress.
[225:59.28]Thanks, dude.
[226:02.04]Sinful proof he's a sellout.
[226:03.62]No, it's proof that I keep going against my own fucking rules.
[226:06.38]Because I just blindly say everything because I'm stupid.
[226:14.16]And then people go, whoa, hold on.
[226:15.30]You read that one.
[226:16.40]Why don't you read this one?
[226:17.42]And I'm just like, fuck.

[227:09.15]I have no idea.
[227:09.65]Oh

[227:48.85]The gifts and the... Hey, I'm gonna say the name of the emote.
[228:01.72]I don't know.
[228:02.54]If I could turn those off, maybe.
[228:06.18]There was a way to turn off the emotes?
[228:09.66]No, I don't think there was.
[228:10.86]There was only ways to turn the item spawning off.
[228:16.33]It was like you determined how much spawning there was.
[228:18.52]I don't think there was anything else there.
[228:20.36]Hey, but thank you, Pepperoni, for the $1.
[228:23.74]I love you, Jeffrey.
[228:24.56]Thanks, man.
[228:28.77]It was in the options?

[229:02.78]Hee hee.
[229:06.21]Wow, you really are blind.
[229:08.27]Well, no, actually, there wasn't even a moment where I wanted to turn it off until the very end anyways.
[229:14.33]There's a lot going on, you know what I mean?
[229:16.05]Like, there literally were fucking hundreds of things going on on the screen.
[229:20.31]You know what I mean?
[229:20.77]Like, so I'm, like, not paying attention to the checkbox that says mute emotes as much as I'm paying attention to my chat has been taken over by just outrageous text and there's 150 things on the screen.
[229:33.10]This is overstimulation.
[229:34.14]Like, you can't pay attention to it at all.
[229:40.58]Is the stream over?
[229:41.34]Yes.
[229:41.54]Technically.
[229:42.12]Technically.
[229:47.90]Have I considered corrective lenses?
[229:49.70]Yes, many times.
[229:53.05]Like a virtual deprivation tank.
[230:00.65]But thanks a lot, guys.
[230:02.51]Also, thank you to Sly161 for the $1.
[230:07.61]Streamlabs, why are you doing this?
[230:09.89]I just said this one.
[230:10.63]We just talked about it.
[230:14.53]I keep getting, like... They keep jumping down on me.
[230:18.04]Smokewise Ganja, thanks for the one dollar.
[230:19.91]LOL, four times.
[230:21.87]Lots of LOL-ing here.

[230:32.09]Turned into a bot.
[230:34.59]Hey Pally K, again, thanks for fifteen dollars.
[230:39.47]Here, have some more gifts.
[230:42.87]Hold on, were the gifts directly correlated to the money?
[230:45.31]I don't understand.
[230:53.88]So that was what that was.
[230:55.12]100 bits was a gift in the game.
[230:57.24]Oh my god.
[231:00.26]That was not... That's why you have $10,000 in my bank account?
[231:13.39]I don't think I have that much right now.
[231:16.55]I'm rich.
[231:20.43]All those gift boxes.
[231:26.60]But thank you, Pa- So when you did that, you spawned 15 boxes.
[231:34.71]That would make sense, right?
[231:36.33]Yeah.
[231:36.71]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[231:45.41]Now I'm glad I couldn't turn it off.

[233:20.46]You didn't lose to a 13-year-old.
[233:21.74]The kid is just playing on his big brother's account.
[233:26.06]No.
[233:27.72]Um... Guys.
[233:30.73]Why would you ever make...
[233:34.77]You wouldn't make 2005 wouldn't be your username if you were born in 2005.
[233:38.88]You would make your username the current year that it is.
[233:46.98]Why would you do that?
[233:48.37]You know how many people have been told by their parents never tell anybody how old you are or what your name is and shit.
[233:57.98]It would be the current year.
[234:07.34]985.
[234:07.36]Yeah, I'm 30.
[234:12.06]I'm 30 years old.
[234:15.11]I've got like 11.
[234:20.19]Old, old.
[234:21.45]It's the current year.
[234:28.48]Why didn't I?
[234:30.12]My mother.
[234:31.60]Because I made that when I was like 24 or 26.
[234:36.36]I wasn't a kid anymore.
[234:38.91]You want to know what my old screen name was called?
[234:45.33]Let me think about it.
[234:45.93]It was Daddy Warbucks.
[234:49.11]600.
[234:49.15]Because I was a huge fan of the play Annie.
[235:04.25]I bet it was not.
[235:09.38]Well, it'll be somebody else's.
[235:12.64]Somebody else will take that.
[235:14.58]Hey, thank you.
[235:15.44]Let's go through these, because these are a lot of $1, like, emote names.
[235:19.93]Wog of the Rat, thanks for the $1.
[235:23.05]The Big Big Jim, thanks for the $1.
[235:25.37]Failfish.
[235:26.89]Cartnor, thanks for the $2.
[235:29.91]I love you, Jermaine.
[235:31.78]Thank you.
[235:33.78]Uh, Atrolux, thanks for the $1 Atrolux.
[235:35.96]I'm very excited for the emote contest.
[235:37.40]Good luck to everybody who entered.
[235:39.70]No, yeah, good luck.
[235:41.12]I'm looking forward to it.
[235:42.04]There are a lot of good ones.
[235:43.32]But I can't be biased and tell you what they are.
[235:48.82]So, there's a lot of interesting ones for sure.
[235:52.76]Okay, let's see what it is.
[236:19.49]It's just a quick little shitpost, you know, let's take a look.
[236:22.63]No, that's... I'm happy that people... check that out, you know?
[236:30.06]Is there a specific theme for the emote contest?
[236:31.82]No.
[236:32.76]It can literally be anything as long... as... it goes by these rules.
[236:43.66]gonna say this one more time I'm gonna read this directly from the Discord it is on it's pinned on the top of the contest Discord please check it it's pinned there let's start and read this just so there's no way anyone could be incorrect about this rules number one your submission format must be the name of your emote
[237:07.99]So it'll be like, everything has to be Jerma, then a word.
[237:11.73]So it can't be a bunch of, it can't be like, Hot Dog, Jerma 4.
[237:15.50]No, it has to be Jerma, and then a word.
[237:19.12]It has to be in the format of 112 by 112, 28 by 28, and 56 by 56.
[237:20.92]It has to be, you have to have all three of those.
[237:23.68]You can post...
[237:38.10]I guess the bigger one first.
[237:40.16]No, it's not JermaHotDog.
[237:41.32]Nobody make that.
[237:42.02]I will delete it instantly.
[237:45.22]Uh, so anyways.
[237:46.76]There's no talking in this channel.
[237:48.80]You just have to make a submission.
[237:50.74]You have to follow the Twitch terms of service.
[237:54.50]So... Yes, that includes, like, if you put, like, a penis in your remote.
[237:59.13]That's not gonna happen.
[238:00.23]It's not going to get uploaded.
[238:02.45]No copyright information.
[238:04.95]No pictures of Garfield.
[238:06.41]It's not gonna, it can't happen.
[238:07.55]It is a, that is a trademark copywritten image.
[238:11.05]No, no penises, no blood.
[238:13.34]No throw up.
[238:18.50]You have to have a transparent background.
[238:21.82]Transparent background.
[238:25.38]No, no specs.
[238:26.76]No background information here.
[238:30.37]No words and no letters.
[238:33.70]So it can't just be the letter, like, the letter four.
[238:36.96]It can't be like the word eight.
[238:38.52]You know what I'm saying?
[238:40.34]It cannot be T. Five.
[238:44.13]Jeric, no words.
[238:46.93]No multi-part emotes.
[238:48.43]It has to be one.
[238:49.33]You can't do, oh, I'm gonna do, uh, Jerma throwing a spear over four emotes.
[238:54.83]No.
[238:55.39]It's gotta be all in one.
[238:58.33]Digital media only.
[239:00.95]And it has to be related to the channel.
[239:04.24]you can't just hey I know I'm gonna no like memes like um owo is not gonna exist it's not gonna happen like if you do like an owo emote that has nothing to do with me if you do like a brick roll face emote what the does that have to do with me nothing those are your rules it has to have something to do with the channel
[239:33.69]What if it's an O.W.O.
[239:34.95]emote of your face?
[239:37.01]I mean, if you can make it do that, you can try.
[239:40.05]O.W.O.
[239:40.33]is the channel.
[239:41.03]No, it's not.
[239:41.67]A Knack 2 emote.
[239:50.02]No, that has nothing to do with me.
[239:53.64]You're just making a joke.
[239:55.61]That's like somebody else's thing.
[239:58.59]You know what we could really use over on the Jerma985 channel?
[240:02.12]A, like, Dunkey emote!
[240:04.00]No, it's funny.
[240:05.04]It's a really funny thing, but it has nothing to do with me.
[240:07.58]That's, like, that's his shit.
[240:08.98]And it's fucking great.
[240:10.34]And he's a funny, talented young man.
[240:23.57]He's 26.
[240:23.81]That's a young man.
[240:26.01]That's young.
[240:27.21]Look, being as old as I am, everybody's young.
[240:34.57]But, yeah, there you go.
[240:36.37]You have until tomorrow at midnight to submit, and then we're gonna go over them, and we'll have a big emote contest on the stream.
[240:44.94]I'll play music, I'll bring some, like, fucking cider and beer and stuff.
[240:48.64]We'll have a fun time.
[240:50.99]They might be a... Never... They won't be a special guest.
[240:54.01]You know?
[240:55.59]We're talking about... It's going to be me.
[240:58.11]And yeah... It might... It's definitely not going to be anybody else but me in front of the camera.
[241:02.51]So make sure you don't miss it.
[241:07.36]30 years young.
[241:08.54]I'm not going to be old until I'm 50.
[241:09.52]Are you kidding me?
[241:14.70]But thank you.
[241:16.50]There are your rules.
[241:18.02]Make sure you do it.
[241:20.84]AceMcLace, thank you again for your $50.
[241:22.98]Huge amount of money.
[241:26.01]I really appreciate that.
[241:30.33]YouWithADog, GetFucked Edition.
[241:32.20]It was fun playing with you.
[241:33.08]Thanks a lot, man.
[241:34.68]And again, thank you for your monumental contribution.
[241:39.21]Um... Garfield's a cat.
[241:40.01]And I am a strong man.
[241:40.61]So, Garfield would sprint at me.
[241:41.67]And I would just pick him up.
[242:11.20]And just drop him in the lava.
[242:15.98]He's a cartoon cat.
[242:21.21]I'm only doing this out of self-defense, by the way.
[242:23.07]No, why am I a bad guy for that?
[242:24.71]He's coming after me, trying to kill me.
[242:27.15]This was like a setup.
[242:29.39]It was like, he's probably going to have a helmet on and a shield and a sword in his hand.
[242:33.37]This is not me just murdering Garfield.
[242:36.54]This was, we were put here and he's trying to kill me.
[242:39.98]He's trying to murder me.
[242:42.08]What am I supposed to do?
[242:42.92]Be like, oh, it's a kitty.
[242:44.08]Come here.
[242:45.10]You're so pretty.
[242:48.46]He's trying to, he's trying to kill me.
[242:50.08]I mean, yes, I could do some like Dark Souls dodge rolling and hope I can survive.
[243:01.06]Garfield is a Dark Souls invader, but that's what he's making it sound like.
[243:07.29]In real life, fat rolling.
[243:08.43]That's what would happen if you tried to do that.
[243:09.82]You'd get hurt.
[243:12.26]Next time you have an opportunity to do a Dark Souls roll, do it and see how much you hurt yourself.
[243:19.30]You don't just throw your body to the side and flip.
[243:21.97]You're going to break your ankle.
[243:24.45]Fat rolling?
[243:25.07]No, you're going to ankle roll.
[243:26.03]You're going to roll your ankle.
[243:31.03]But anyways, thank you.
[243:35.61]Yeah, I mean, that's... The game is good.
[243:37.21]It's definitely a great game.
[244:00.63]I just hope that they can capitalize on some of the very, very clear, cool content pieces to add to the game.
[244:11.46]My pleasure.
[244:12.68]For real.
[244:14.22]Atrolux, thanks for the $1.
[244:15.42]No, I was Lord Taco.
[244:16.58]Don't believe him.
[244:20.89]Who do I believe?
[244:21.85]And thanks again, Atrolux, for another dollar after that.
[244:24.85]Did you know that walking was invented by Christopher Walken in 1982 when he tried to run at half speed?
[244:30.59]Isn't that interesting?
[244:32.97]Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[244:33.89]I'm glad we heard that today.
[244:36.63]Honeychain, thanks for the one dollar.
[244:37.86]Just take my money.
[244:39.42]I mean, I will.
[244:40.04]Thank you.
[244:43.08]Cartnor, again, for two dollars in a row here, just says, take my money, take it all.
[244:48.28]Please don't give me all your money.
[244:51.02]Do not do that.
[244:52.22]I would strongly encourage you not to do that.
[244:56.23]Niall Oregon, thanks for the $1.
[244:57.57]Hello again, Dad.
[244:58.29]Would it be cool if I gift you one of my favorite Steam games to try?
[245:00.91]And if yes, would you try it on Steam?
[245:03.57]Stream?
[245:04.75]Uh, no.
[245:07.29]Nope, I do not want any gifts.
[245:10.53]You don't have to give me any Steam games.
[245:12.81]If it's something that I'm interested in playing on whatever, I will buy it and I will play it.
[245:19.83]because I'll give you a couple of reasons why reason number one is if somebody says hey I'm gonna pay you like some money and I'm also gonna gift you this game and I'll I want you to stream it then what happens is well that guy did that that guy said hey jerma I'm gonna give you this free game I'm gonna gift you a game and play it on stream and then all of a sudden it's like well how come you did it for him
[245:46.44]you gotta do it for me it's like oh yeah and then you do it for that guy and then how come you didn't do it for me here's 10 bucks do it for me it's like whoa I no I like to just kind of completely bite that in the butt uh I don't like accept like Steam game gifts I don't you know I just don't want them so especially if it's considering if it's something that wants to be on stream
[246:12.10]Like, here, gift this and play it on stream.
[246:14.10]It's like, I'd rather just not do it at all.
[246:17.10]But if you have a game that you want me to play, put it in the recommend.
[246:19.98]This is what we did today.
[246:22.05]This clone drone game came from the Discord.
[246:26.25]In fact, the next couple of streams are all games that I pulled from the Discord.
[246:29.59]Holdfast, Clone Drones, Wreckfest.
[246:33.00]There's another one that I don't want to even talk about because it's so... it seems so fucking fun.
[246:37.94]And it's going to be potentially a really fun... You know what?
[246:39.80]Who cares?
[246:40.06]I'll just say it.
[246:42.56]The game is called A Blind Legend.
[246:45.52]And it's a game that has no visuals.
[246:49.66]It's an audio-only experience.
[246:52.87]And you have to, like, play through the game.
[246:56.75]It seems really, really, really interesting.
[247:01.54]It's a game where you play as a blind... A blind knight.
[247:09.00]A blind legend.
[247:13.87]That sounds lame.
[247:14.71]What?! !
[247:17.36]That sounds like so much fun.
[247:18.94]Play it blindfolded.
[247:19.90]That's what I was going to do.
[247:20.66]I'm going to have this... I'm going to have the camera on the whole time.
[247:23.66]Yeah, there it is.
[247:29.70]Yep, that's it.
[247:35.08]Papa Sangre.
[247:35.70]Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking about.
[247:37.66]I might play that too.
[247:44.88]But the game just sounded very, very interesting.
[247:54.11]Play more PopCap games.
[247:56.25]Yeah, but to close that, if you have a recommendation, I read it all the time.
[248:01.85]Every game that you're going to see for the next two or three streams in a row was just, I took them from the recommended from Discord.
[248:08.71]I do read it, and they do go on stream.
[248:11.80]Trust me.
[248:12.84]I'm a doctor.
[248:14.58]Hey, it's time for slime.
[248:15.38]Thanks for the $5.
[248:15.74]Hey, Jeremy, your streams inspired me to animate this.
[248:29.49]Well, here you go.
[248:32.17]What am I doing?
[248:32.85]Am I snorting in this?
[248:37.67]Hey, Cartner, thanks for the $1.
[248:38.97]Plays endless mode.
[248:40.05]Oh, I can keep going.
[248:42.15]Well, but that was a challenge.
[248:43.85]I didn't know that was actually endless mode.
[248:45.41]I thought that was just beat 14 levels.
[248:48.55]I don't know you could actually keep going in that.
[248:52.64]But thank you.
[248:53.00]Uh and Doxin, thank you and Doxin for the one dollar. Hey Jerma I really love all the content you do and bring a light to my day and night.
[248:59.90]I asked during the stream but you must have missed it: have I ever heard of Shammy TV?
[249:05.00]He's a really funny guy and I'd love to see some sort of collab of some sort even if it's a podcast.
[249:10.00]He already recommended your channel in a video of his. Either way, love you dude.
[249:12.00]Um the way that I look at stuff like collaborations and doing things with other people-
[249:20.29]I don't really go out of my way to try to: hey, let's do stuff.
[249:23.95]Hey, let's do stuff. Hey, let's do stuff.
[249:25.97]I think it's naturally just you end up wanting to do something with people.
[249:31.47]I mean, if you take a look at the last few times I've played with somebody, I mean, like Vinny was introduced to me and I was introduced to him through like a fake rivalry that made no sense.
[249:48.91]I'm not anti-social I just I just don't I don't like I don't like play with people I play with some people but I don't do many multiplayer things with like other streamers and YouTubers this is not something I do he's a loner fake well I mean the fake in the sense that of course there's a real rivalry
[250:16.60]There's a real rivalry here between me and Vinny, I'll tell you.
[250:19.74]I mean, it's very clear who's winning, right?
[250:24.86]I mean, like, look at me.
[250:26.94]I get, like, 3,000 less concurrent viewers than him, and, you know, he's been, like, around for a long time.
[250:31.68]He makes great music.
[250:32.44]I mean, it's very clear who's currently, you know, in the lead there, right?
[250:42.25]No, he's a great dude.
[250:45.01]Feels bad.
[250:46.28]No.
[250:51.62]No, but to cap that, I don't... Personally, I just kind of like to do whatever I'm going to do.
[251:01.22]And if that means other people are going to get involved and I'm going to start to reach out to other people, then I will.
[251:05.93]But for the time being, I just kind of do what I'm doing.
[251:12.34]I'm not looking around for like, hey, dude, you want to play?
[251:14.26]Hey, what are you doing?
[251:15.24]Hey, streamers.
[251:16.74]Hey, are there any streamers that want to play?
[251:19.28]I need like six fucking people.
[251:21.10]Let's do it.
[251:21.64]Get in the call.
[251:22.34]Hey, what's up, man?
[251:23.24]Whoa, yo.
[251:24.08]Hey, watch out.
[251:25.24]Oh, it exploded.
[251:26.46]What, it exploded?
[251:27.58]Did you see that explosion?
[251:28.66]What the fuck?
[251:29.68]Oh, he just got hit in the face by a wrench.
[251:32.66]Like, I don't typically do well in those scenarios.
[251:36.70]I don't.
[251:37.81]I just don't.
[251:38.17]And I'm not going to lie.
[251:47.88]And that's before the game starts.
[251:58.91]Yeah, that all happens before.
[252:00.12]That happens when we're just hanging out.
[252:03.82]And that's not to say I hate those scenarios, but I just feel like I don't do as well in those situations.
[252:11.05]Rather than just like myself with one other person that I really know.
[252:17.15]You guys know that.
[252:17.79]I don't have to tell you that.
[252:19.54]I'm sure that's pretty obvious.
[252:26.24]But.
[252:29.29]In denial about being antisocial.
[252:30.75]No, I don't.
[252:32.78]Look, I'm not antisocial.
[252:33.84]I go out all the time.
[252:35.40]I go out all the time.
[252:36.16]I go out all the time.
[252:37.76]I have plenty of friends around here.
[252:38.98]I go to people's houses.
[252:40.14]I go to parties.
[252:41.14]I got plenty of friends around here.
[252:42.18]I'm not a loser.
[252:43.12]I'm not a loser.
[252:43.68]Don't call me a loser.
[252:44.48]Don't call me antisocial.
[252:45.41]What are you doing?
[252:48.99]He go out all the time.
[252:50.27]Alright, let's keep going.

[253:19.58]Thanks, Obree.
[253:20.54]Thanks, Obree, for the $1.
[253:21.42]Hey, you should stream Hotline Miami.
[253:23.30]Also, you're an angry baby.
[253:27.52]actually I was thinking about Hotline Miami that was heavily requested too we might do that stay tuned hey milkshake thanks for the one dollar can you and Ster make a comeback album like kanye did uh I don't know probably not dude I'm moving to Vegas there's no internet there I'm just gonna be eating sand spiders
[253:54.74]Hey, Andoxin, thanks for the $1.
[253:56.36]I forgot to ask this in my last message, so here's some more money.
[253:58.80]Am I going to play Red Dead Redemption 2 when it comes out this year?
[254:02.59]I loved your first streams of it.
[254:03.69]Yes.
[254:05.41]I will be one of those day zero, day one Red Dead Redemption streams.
[254:11.07]I cannot wait for that game.
[254:12.03]The first one was amazing.
[254:13.12]It was a very fun experience.
[254:14.30]I loved it.
[254:15.50]I'm sure I'm going to love the second one.
[254:18.89]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[254:20.03]It feels like I've been missing a lot of your streams lately, but I guess that means I'll have something to watch before bed.
[254:24.79]Was the game any good?
[254:26.75]The game was very good.
[254:29.35]I would say, for an early access game, it was... probably... Look, it looks like they're trying to do a bunch of stuff.
[254:38.63]They're trying to have a story mode.
[254:39.79]They're trying to have a challenge in endless Twitch integration, multiplayer.
[254:45.31]My only fear is when you try to do so much, you spread yourself thin, and then you go, holy shit, man, we got a lot to do.
[254:53.82]But I think it's a great game.
[254:56.36]For what it is, for sure.
[255:01.02]But thank you, Darkstar.
[255:03.04]Hey, JJ, thanks for the $1.
[255:04.80]Take my money, you greedy streamer.
[255:07.94]Don't think of me like that.
[255:08.86]Come on.
[255:09.68]Is that how it is?
[255:12.50]When does the stream actually end?
[255:13.98]In about five minutes when I get to the end of these bits.
[255:19.97]And yes, I'm going to have a different screen, a different animation.
[255:25.33]I'm going to see if Florida wants to do it.
[255:26.59]If we're not stream over, we're going to make like a end of stream hangout session card with music.
[255:35.16]So...
[255:36.48]I have to ask him.
[255:37.84]Like, oh yeah, that's going to happen.
[255:40.32]I probably should ask the guy that would be making it if they'd want to do that.
[255:44.07]So, we'll see.
[255:47.93]Thank you to Darkstar for the $1 here.
[255:52.73]Special message from WhyDoWitchesBurn.
[255:54.85]Been watching your streams and YouTube videos since the beginning of 2011.
[255:58.81]First time I've ever been a part of it.
[256:00.23]Hope you have a good one, man.
[256:01.31]Well, you too.
[256:03.17]No, thanks.
[256:05.13]Um, you have, you have some skill in this game.
[256:07.69]Good job on your GG's there.
[256:11.13]It's fun playing with you, dude, for real.
[256:13.67]Thanks for watching.
[256:14.87]For a long time.
[256:17.41]Sprio, thanks for the $1.20.
[256:18.15]Uh, wait, it isn't 2005.
[256:21.23]So you are 20 years old.
[256:22.51]Thinking face.
[256:25.79]Believe whatever you feel like.
[256:26.92]Maybe.
[256:27.94]Hey, Daddy Warbuck, $600.
[256:29.34]Thanks for the $1.
[256:30.52]He says, hey, I knew that was gonna happen.
[256:33.53]Look, don't you guys understand?
[256:34.35]Any username that I say that's not taken, someone's gonna get it in three minutes.
[256:40.98]Like, alright.
[256:44.80]ArchaeologistZoologist2.
[256:47.74]I wonder if that person will show up in about two minutes.
[256:52.10]Or, how about, hmm, how about, uh, GiraffeBreeder616.
[256:58.86]Okay.
[257:00.18]Uh... Don't steal the remote!
[257:03.80]Dad.
[257:04.16]Okay.
[257:06.24]Uh, what else we got?
[257:08.63]Um... Crush.
[257:12.77]With a K. And it's the... It's a CH at the end.
[257:16.05]So it's like crunch.
[257:16.97]Like crutch.
[257:19.53]And then... Crutch Dark Souls 2.
[257:21.87]Crutch DS 2.
[257:26.49]Okay.
[257:26.87]Let's see how... Um...
[257:30.95]Thank you for that, by the way.
[257:35.35]Hey, GK9999, thanks for the $1.
[257:36.43]Hey, Jeremiah, after downloading PUBG Mobile a couple of days ago when you played it on stream, I ended up winning my first match.
[257:43.07]So I want to thank you for showing that it was better than I assumed.
[257:45.86]Completely agree with it being nicer to play than the regular PUBG, which I'm currently uninstalling.
[257:50.50]You know what's really funny?
[257:52.84]I'm glad you mentioned that.
[257:55.78]I reinstalled PUBG yesterday.
[257:59.95]And I played it.
[258:01.71]And I'm not kidding.
[258:03.49]I played three rounds.
[258:05.89]Instantly died three times.
[258:09.07]Was cursing out loud how much I despised the game.
[258:12.71]And uninstalled it.
[258:14.31]This is real.
[258:15.51]That actually fucking happened yesterday.
[258:21.56]I'll play the mobile one instead.
[258:29.88]that's exactly why I did it yeah yeah I I landed and died and landed and died landed and died and I don't know I got really mad at the controls I got mad at like dragging and hitting right click to pick up something and then I just like this game I just delete right click on Steam uninstall remove delete from local disk
[258:57.20]I'll still play it on mobile because if I feel like it, you know.
[259:01.52]Beating bots is fun.
[259:04.63]You can't beat people that are actually using their fingers and thumbs.
[259:09.31]I'm gonna say something right now that might really piss people off.
[259:13.09]You know, people already think I'm like a casual idiot, so it doesn't matter.
[259:18.29]Here's the thing about playing games like PUBG, Dota, League of Legends, any of these like highly, like Overwatch even too, right?
[259:27.02]Any of these like super highly competitive multiplayer games,
[259:31.56]You'll try to- I wish there was a queue that instead of it was- instead of the queue that was like, click this queue to play with people that play this game six hours a day.
[259:41.32]I don't want to click on that queue.
[259:42.58]Where's the one where it's like, I want to play with people that are like missing fingers.
[259:45.70]You know what I mean?
[259:46.84]Where's like the other queue?
[259:48.16]Where's like the, I just like don't give a fuck, like I just want to play the game and queue up against like children queue.
[259:52.69]I don't want to play against like the good high level players that play the game all the time.
[260:01.99]Then there'd be Smurfs in that queue, too.
[260:04.02]But you know what I mean, though?
[260:04.74]I wish there was a way that you could scan my eyes and get into my brain and be like, oh, here's his real skill level.
[260:10.36]And you put me in with the fucking rejects.
[260:14.90]Because it can be really daunting.
[260:16.28]It can't be really... The world I'm looking for is not fun.
[260:20.42]Because if you just want to jump into a game like that and just play, and there's people that are playing, and they're trying to fucking win every game, and by the way, absolutely, because that's what you're supposed to do in those games.
[260:29.48]You are supposed to fucking play to win those games.
[260:32.10]So, I'm not telling you that it's the wrong thing to do, I'm just saying that I wish I could play with the rejects.
[260:40.50]Smurfing is so much fun, but that's what I mean.
[260:42.70]You need something to scan your fingers to see if you've done it before.
[260:50.46]If it's not fun, why bother?
[260:54.10]No, look, again, I'm not saying that that's something that's not fun or not cool.
[261:00.98]It's just sometimes I kind of just want to half pay attention and just ride around in a car and, oh, there's a guy!
[261:05.80]And not just get fucking dumped on.
[261:19.15]What?
[261:20.47]Jeremiah's the only guy that hangs out at arcades and shows off to kids.
[261:35.95]But the thing, I like watching.
[261:39.31]I really am such a, you know what, I'm just getting too old.
[261:42.71]That really is what's happening.
[261:44.91]because these really super competitive games like watching for instance like the smite tournament or watching the the Fortnite or PUBG tournaments it is kind of cool you can just see people that are really fucking good that you can never beat you will never beat these people and you get to see them all in the same place play I think that shit is awesome but not me but I still think these games are kind of cool but I can't participate
[262:14.23]It's like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[262:17.27]Oh, I want to play in like the fucking Reindeer Battle Royale games.
[262:20.59]Nope.
[262:21.15]Sorry, your nose is red.
[262:23.23]That's how you're the casual.
[262:24.77]You have the red casual nose.
[262:26.89]You don't get to play.
[262:27.61]Somebody said talk louder?
[262:37.80]Am I talking?
[262:38.44]Is my mic turned up?
[262:50.69]I am morally opposed to practicing for a video game.
[262:58.03]Do you think these people were born with these skills?
[262:59.69]The majority, if not all of them, spend like 100 hours a week training.
[263:03.51]Yeah, and that's great.
[263:04.95]That's awesome.
[263:05.49]I'm glad that people are like that.
[263:06.59]Look, there's people that speedrun the same game for four years and find new glitches, and they pull their time down by like 45 seconds.
[263:15.05]That shit's really interesting.
[263:19.85]Give me like a fucking cue if we can all get us all in the same place.
[263:27.95]Getting over it.
[263:32.15]No, but... I think that comes with just time and age and... Because like back five, ten years ago, I probably would have been trying to be very good at some of these.
[263:47.64]I just don't, I've lost my patience for playing a game for like four, five, six hours a day.
[263:52.76]I just can't, I can't, my brain can't do it anymore.
[263:59.43]I should speedrun.
[264:03.89]It gets to a point where I'm just like, ugh, I have to do something else.
[264:12.21]You know what's actually great?
[264:13.19]Fistful of Frags.
[264:13.89]I wish there was like a pro Fistful of Frags scene.
[264:15.99]I wish that game would be
[264:19.88]I used to play 10 plus hours a day.
[264:21.44]I barely do that in a week now.
[264:24.10]Yeah.
[264:27.53]I think I still play... I'm trying to think of... Just streaming in general.
[264:32.43]Let's say there's like 3 streams a week or 4 streams a week sometimes.
[264:37.33]Each stream is about 5-ish on average hours.
[264:40.76]4 to 6 hours.
[264:42.70]So I mean I still technically am playing a game for...
[264:47.29]least on camera like at least what like 16 30 like sometimes 20 hours a week 25 hours a week so I still play a lot but I feel like I jump around I don't like stick to one experience anymore like I used to but I still like to enjoy it I still like to watch
[265:15.50]I'm a big watcher when it comes to highly competitive games.
[265:20.04]I think it's very interesting.
[265:22.92]But, uh, after that long, uh, talk about how I'm too old to be good at video games anymore, uh, let's keep going.
[265:32.53]Thank you, The Orange Pyro Ranger, for the $1.
[265:35.63]Speaking of Vinesauce, has the idea of a Jerma Rumble vine wrestle crossover come up?
[265:40.68]No.
[265:43.14]No, not really.
[265:43.72]Okay.
[265:45.87]I do encourage you all to support the charity stream that's coming up there.
[265:51.26]The Vinesauce yearly charity stream, I believe, is very soon, isn't it?
[265:58.76]When is it?
[266:01.54]It's either this weekend or next weekend.
[266:07.01]Let me see.
[266:12.35]It is...
[266:17.61]It gets you an exact day, so I'm not, uh, wrong.
[266:21.33]Yeah, it's next weekend.
[266:22.11]So, July 20th through the 22nd.
[266:26.01]The, uh, Vinesauce is Hope 2018 charity stream.
[266:29.69]Starts on Friday.
[266:31.83]Go support it.
[266:33.27]Great bunch of guys and girls over there.
[266:34.81]A lot of great people.
[266:39.11]So, highly encourage you to support it.
[266:43.91]But besides that, uh, no, we have never come up with, like, a crossover or something.
[266:50.85]It's not just Vinny.
[266:51.87]I think it's like all of Vinesauce.
[266:53.43]I think it's the whole crew.
[266:54.81]They stream for like two straight days.
[266:58.55]Something like that.
[267:00.29]Am I going to show up with my lawnmower again?
[267:01.89]That was a very like spur-of-the-moment appearance.
[267:08.24]I don't know.
[267:12.58]Regardless, support it for sure.
[267:15.50]But anyways, thank you to...
[267:19.88]Spreo for the $1.20.
[267:20.90]Here are some more seagull facts.
[267:22.34]Did you know that seagulls are extremely intelligent to the point that they throw floating bits of bread on water to lure fish to the surface?
[267:30.54]Most animals can't use this type of planning.
[267:34.78]Smart.
[267:37.06]They're like the smartest animal on Earth, aren't they?
[267:39.19]They're above dolphins.
[267:40.91]Hey, I'm Dox, and thanks for the $1.
[267:41.89]I'm going to spend some ad bits to have Jerma say...
[267:45.51]Vinesauce's Hope charity stream is next weekend, and it's a great cause to even just... Yeah, I just did it.
[267:50.07]I just did it.
[267:50.89]That's twice.
[267:51.38]There you go.
[267:54.90]Thank you, Oobree, for the $1.
[267:56.20]Hi, bud.
[267:56.52]Would you consider playing Saints Row 2 on stream?
[267:59.06]A lot like the blast that was the true crime streams, and you could play co-op as well.
[268:05.14]Probably.
[268:06.76]Saints Row 2 is one of those guaranteed.
[268:08.96]It's definitely going to be fun for at least a couple hours stream.
[268:13.22]We'll see, though.
[268:13.96]I've already played it.
[268:14.64]I already made a video on it, too.
[268:16.66]We'll have to see about that.
[268:19.53]But, lucky Luke, thanks for the $1.28, jermaPluto.
[268:22.01]Thank you.
[268:23.25]Base Grandpa, thanks for the $5.
[268:25.17]Is Warframe on the Jerma stream list?
[268:26.93]No.
[268:29.63]Warframe is just killing it lately.
[268:32.69]People are still playing it.
[268:35.50]But, I've tried it a few times.
[268:37.52]It's not something I think I'd ever want to stream.
[268:38.94]Hmm.
[268:41.47]But thank you for the $5, appreciate it.
[268:42.93]But no, probably no Warframe streams in the future.
[268:47.77]VRJosh, to wrap it up here, thanks for the $1.
[268:49.91]Have you ever heard about the King's Field series?
[268:52.57]Yes.
[268:53.46]They are FromSoftware's early RPGs on PS1 and show a lot of the roots of the souls.
[268:59.40]I have seen King's Field.
[269:02.70]I've watched some gameplay of King's Field and it looks really rough.
[269:07.94]So, I mean, maybe we could play that.
[269:10.23]I don't know.
[269:12.60]It seems like it's a really early alpha build of Dark Souls.
[269:18.56]And it's first person.
[269:21.30]We'll see though.
[269:22.08]That sounds like maybe a fun thing to just throw up one day.
[269:26.90]But that's going to be it.
[269:28.26]Thank you everybody for watching.
[269:30.08]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[269:32.04]We'll probably play Holdfast on Monday.
[269:35.02]Or Wreckfest.
[269:36.87]We might do both.
[269:38.60]We might just do like a combo Wreckfest for like a couple hours and then Holdfast for a couple hours.
[269:44.70]But yeah, have a good, um... Have a good sleep.
[269:47.92]Have a good night.
[269:49.14]I will see you guys all on the next one.
[269:51.74]Take care, everybody.
[269:52.32]See you soon.
[269:52.92]And CluelessSniper for $1.
[269:54.32]Mr. Destructoid, hello human.
[269:55.52]Here's a gift for you, Mr. Destructoid.
[269:58.12]Thank you.
[270:00.12]Thank you for the... And thanks for playing.
[270:02.78]Thanks for participating.
[270:04.50]By the way, this is absolutely not the thing I was talking about when I talked about participation.
[270:10.02]That will be an IRL stream.
[270:12.45]That's going to be a stream that will be not me at the computer.
[270:17.03]That is your only hint.
[270:18.69]Have a good rest of your night.
[270:19.71]Take care.
[270:21.35]Somebody just subscribed right now.
[270:23.85]And it was BlazeMan.
[270:24.91]Thank you.
[270:26.93]Have a good night.
[270:30.26]See you Monday.
[270:39.15]No, the stream's not going to be pre-recorded either.
[270:41.87]Because you guys have to interact with it.
[270:44.29]If you guys don't interact with it, it will not function.
[270:47.50]So there you go.
[270:48.58]It's not pre-recorded.
[270:49.34]See you later.
[270:50.60]Good night.
[270:58.18]I know it's not the thing.
[270:59.22]Neither of the things that I talked about in the official podcast.
[271:04.27]Neither one of those is something else completely.
[271:05.63]Alright, good night.
[271:06.83]See you later.
[271:07.35]Hey, see you on Monday.
[271:07.89]Good night.
[271:14.57]Thank you.
