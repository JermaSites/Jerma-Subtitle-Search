[00:08.96]Oh!
[00:11.14]Oh no, that was a shpee.
[00:13.16]He just jumped out to try to stab me in the face.
[00:25.01]Get out of town.
[00:26.61]Arc those bullets.
[00:28.37]Yeah.
[00:31.07]Right click is sandwich.
[00:32.79]Alright.
[00:35.94]These guys put the sentry on top of the point.
[00:39.34]Oh, get it!
[00:39.94]There we go.
[00:41.86]We got one more point to cap.
[00:42.90]Sentry, sentry, sentry, sentry.
[00:44.18]Look out, look out.
[00:46.38]Look out, there's the sentry.
[00:48.54]God, it's so hard to arc these bullets.
[00:50.99]I'm almost dead.
[00:52.51]What if I just sit here and spam over there?
[00:54.24]Oh, they disappear.
[00:55.80]There's actual range on these.
[00:57.46]Good to know.
[00:57.94]Oh, dear.
[01:01.54]Please.
[01:04.08]Kill him.
[01:04.76]Kill him.
[01:09.08]No.
[01:15.29]The pyro looks like a skeleton.
[01:17.55]Look at this scream mask he has on.
[01:20.71]He looks like an anteater scream mask.
[01:23.85]What the fuck is that?
[01:25.09]Alright, let's go airblast some motherfuckers right now.
[01:34.38]Come on, get in range!
[01:35.72]Airblast.
[01:38.46]Fuck, I don't have enough ammo!
[01:39.94]God damn it!
[01:43.32]I gotta get a couple kills with the pyro.
[01:45.38]I mean, come on.
[01:47.18]There it is.
[01:48.24]Oh, let me get that last hit.
[01:52.30]What the hell was that Medic doing?
[01:55.00]Medic, that was not a safe choice.
[01:58.94]Cap this last point.
[02:00.44]You wanna go, Engie?
[02:01.56]I should probably stay on that.
[02:04.08]Ooh, spy!
[02:04.64]I got the spy.
[02:06.94]Don't let him build that sentry!
[02:08.92]Nice job.
[02:09.62]Nice job.
[02:10.64]You have no health.
[02:12.08]Let's hope you don't get destroyed.
[02:12.98]We're gonna win!
[02:13.68]I saw that spy.
[02:15.54]Yeah!
[02:17.11]Get burnt.
[02:17.65]There we go.
[02:19.69]Let's go scout.
[02:22.50]What are these, like, generators?
[02:27.92]Double jump, cool, cool.
[02:30.14]I love this jump noise.
[02:32.70]I kind of want this in regular TF2.
[02:35.69]I'm going to figure out how to mod that and put that in as a jump file.
[02:40.33]Move around fast.
[02:42.09]Too many people on red.
[02:43.77]Too many red people.
[02:46.15]Too many red team.
[02:47.19]Too many red team.
[02:49.82]Gotta play it like you actually play Scout.
[02:56.19]Are there any unlockables in this game?
[02:59.99]Ah, gotta try hard, hold on.
[03:02.19]Hold on, I gotta double try hard.
[03:06.91]Oh, he blew himself up!
[03:09.44]Fucking god!
[03:10.72]That's the second time that's happened!
[03:13.36]This guy with his, like, direct hit bullshit.
[03:16.51]Oh, Jerma's getting a little mad here.
[03:18.59]Calm down.
[03:19.19]It's okay.
[03:19.67]It's just gang garrison.
[03:22.17]Is this the guy?
[03:22.71]This is the guy.
[03:25.79]How many shots does it take till you get to the center of a goddamn soldier?
[03:29.20]That's what I want to know.
[03:33.12]I got him.
[03:33.64]At least I got him.
[03:34.48]That's all I care about.
[03:35.32]All I care about is I killed that guy.
[03:38.66]Now make it to their generator room.
[03:41.20]Just run by everybody.
[03:42.21]You're the scout, Jerma.
[03:43.13]Come on.
[03:44.45]Let's go here.
[03:45.99]There it is.
[03:46.37]Generator.
[03:47.35]They got a sentry in here.
[03:49.73]God damn it.
[03:56.01]This guy's trying to... What?
[03:58.75]What?
[04:00.13]What?
[04:01.91]I killed a spy?
[04:02.95]How the hell did that happen?
[04:06.90]Alright.
[04:09.18]I want to get this guy.
[04:10.10]This guy is just causing me all kinds of trouble.
[04:16.24]Yeah, let's go.
[04:16.96]Why does he engineer?
[04:21.12]There it is.
[04:23.84]This thing's almost dead.
[04:25.08]We're gonna lose.
[04:26.62]We're going to lose right now.
[04:29.34]I can't even get in that room.
[04:30.14]We need, like, somebody to take out that sentry.
[04:31.54]Oh, here are the two soldiers again.
[04:34.08]Oh, bye.
[04:35.75]And there's a sentry in here.
[04:37.57]Still in here?
[04:38.27]Yeah, it is.
[04:39.29]I'm so dead.
[04:39.93]Goodbye.
[04:40.85]Go down to, like, the sewers.
[04:42.49]Yeah, bait him.
[04:43.11]That's what you want.
[04:43.59]You want to bait him.
[04:44.13]You want to bait him.
[04:45.80]Get painted!
[04:50.04]This guy knows I have, like, no HP.
[04:52.98]Come on, shoot me.
[04:59.51]What a pain in the ass I am.
[05:03.03]No!
[05:03.57]Damn, I woulda- I probably woulda killed him.
[05:08.76]Something tells me it's gonna be really, really friggin' difficult to play Spy.
[05:13.32]Cause it's only on a 2D plane, somebody's just gonna spam over here like I did earlier and just kill me.
[05:19.36]There's no disguise I don't think, I'm just cloaked.
[05:22.11]Looks like the cloak is infinite though.
[05:24.45]So that's good.
[05:25.83]That's good.
[05:27.67]What?
[05:28.81]Is that friendly fire?
[05:29.77]No way.
[05:30.09]Just gotta get behind enemy lines and wait for some sorry sucker to come over here.
[05:37.92]What?
[05:39.86]Is that the Cave Story guy?
[05:45.16]Alright the 10th class you heard it here folks is the 10th class is confirmed the Cave Story guy Okay, okay, okay here.
[05:56.11]We go gonna get the backstab right here.
[05:59.63]Oh my God That's so slow.
[06:03.84]Oh I did it Big Steve I got him
[06:14.18]I actually got both of them.
[06:24.29]I can't believe I actually... I kind of like Spy.
[06:37.59]Spy is a lot of fun.
[06:38.83]Let's follow this asshole up here.
[06:43.24]How does he know I'm here?
[06:43.82]He didn't bump into me.
[06:46.86]How does this guy know I'm here?
[06:48.18]There's no way he knows.
[06:49.04]I'm cloaked right now.
[06:51.92]What a bastard.
[06:54.14]I can't even make this jump anyways.
[06:55.54]There, he's gonna come back up here.
[06:56.70]Here's another scout.
[07:01.91]Get over here.
[07:04.15]Screw it, we're going this way.
[07:08.33]This bubble gun, bullshit.
[07:09.81]What the hell?
[07:10.47]You can't... How am I supposed to combat this?
[07:13.57]It's just a... It's cool that they have like these demade maps.
[07:19.89]That's very interesting.
[07:21.98]Very interesting.
[07:23.04]I'm going down below.
[07:25.72]Forget this.
[07:26.20]I'm gonna come up from the pine.
[07:31.62]Or we can just spawn camp them.
[07:32.82]That'll work too.
[07:35.42]This guy is legitimately just firing into the spawn waiting for someone to appear.
[07:40.17]Oh my god, this is awful.
[07:45.76]Spawn camp city, come on now.
[07:49.48]Who am I to say that?
[07:50.38]I'm probably gonna just jump down and try to backstab someone.
[07:53.86]Well, we got striking similarities between TF2 and Gang Garrison.
[07:57.63]The spawn camping is in both games.
[08:00.43]Striking similarities.
[08:02.99]You gotta be kidding me.
