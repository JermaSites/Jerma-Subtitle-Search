[00:06.15]What are you guys betting on?
[00:07.91]Betting on something?
[00:08.61]Betting on what?
[00:10.87]Coin flip.
[00:11.59]Oh, it's a coin flip.
[00:17.74]Free stream coin flip.
[00:18.78]Okay.
[00:20.12]Hello.
[00:21.84]Welcome back, everybody.
[00:25.72]I wanted to stream yesterday, but I didn't.
[00:30.03]I'm still kind of dealing with some problems medically.
[00:34.34]And it's... We're going to just take it easy.
[00:37.00]We're going to take it slow.
[00:40.72]I'm trying to make sure that by the baseball stream I'm ready to go.
[00:45.64]I talked a little bit in pre-stream about it.
[00:48.16]But... There is a lot of stuff going on.
[00:51.84]Let's go over it.
[00:52.62]Wait, hold on.
[00:52.98]I've got to wait for people to get here.
[00:56.38]Say you're sorry now.
[00:57.44]No, I'm not going to apologize.
[01:00.38]I'm not going to apologize for what?
[01:02.73]What am I saying sorry for?
[01:03.65]No.
[01:05.47]No apologies.
[01:06.55]I didn't do anything wrong.
[01:10.25]And I'm getting wicked defensive.
[01:11.47]I'm getting wicked defensive about it already.
[01:16.49]We're worried.
[01:17.10]I'm fine.
[01:17.96]Don't worry.
[01:18.60]I'll be alright.
[01:21.24]Don't worry.
[01:23.76]But here's what's going on today.
[01:26.08]Something really cool.
[01:31.07]We got a multi-versus tournament that I'm going to be participating in.
[01:37.35]Ludwig put it together.
[01:39.36]I think I'm ready to play.
[01:42.26]That's what we're doing today.
[01:44.96]Tomorrow, still think it's planned to do the Call of Duty thing with Myth.
[01:51.78]We'll see how that goes.
[01:53.59]If anything's changing, I'll let you know in pre-stream by tomorrow.
[01:58.01]Friday, we're going to play Two Point Campus.
[02:03.01]As a, excuse me, sponsor stream.
[02:07.33]And then Sunday is green screen movie night part two.
[02:10.61]Ain't going to cancel on you on Sunday.
[02:14.93]Ain't going to cancel on you on Sunday.
[02:16.90]I can guarantee you that.
[02:23.18]And then Monday, we're going to do a pre-baseball hype stream.
[02:30.33]Where I kind of just shout it out a lot, talk about it, hang out for an hour or two.
[02:35.11]And then baseball is next week.
[02:36.71]So that's the plan for this week here.
[02:45.74]Please wear the same Red Sox shirt that you wore last time.
[02:48.38]Yeah, there's your plan.
[02:56.59]If anything changes, I'll let you know, but I don't think it will.
[03:01.99]Wait, baseball is next week.
[03:03.39]Yes.
[03:09.18]Baseball is next week.
[03:12.00]The 19th of August.
[03:13.32]Do you have a Discord update for it?
[03:24.26]I don't know.
[03:27.14]So anyways, we're going to play.
[03:28.28]I'm going to warm up a little bit.
[03:33.58]Play some multiverses, get ready, because this is a tournament.
[03:36.62]I got to be ready for it.
[03:40.84]Happy birthday, Andy.
[03:47.51]Is sorcery over?
[03:48.55]No, of course not.
[03:52.29]I just, there's a, I was going to be very busy this week into next week.
[03:56.24]So when we come back from baseball, we'll do some chill sorcery stuff.
[03:59.34]We'll continue part three.
[04:00.14]Don't worry.
[04:02.28]called the lamb mortuary assistant there's a this stuff that I want to play I'm just to the brim right now you sound like you're gonna sell me a vacuum would it work if I held a vacuum up to you right now and I was like this is 300 give me the money would you give it to me
[04:33.35]Is this slow pitch softball?
[04:36.95]I don't know where you heard softball.
[04:39.35]This is a baseball game.
[04:40.79]This is a baseball game.
[04:43.76]What do you mean softball?
[04:45.00]This is a baseball game.
[04:49.88]Who told you that?
[04:50.86]You got wrong information.
[04:56.55]Somebody just ask what's the difference?
[05:02.02]Ah, there's a big difference between how softball and baseball is played.
[05:07.47]Very slight differences, but there are a lot.
[05:13.33]It's the same exact concept.
[05:19.36]Alright, let me do some warm-up games.
[05:21.10]I gotta lose to, like, five people in a row.
[05:25.61]Before we get started here.
[05:26.89]I don't know when the tournament's starting.
[05:28.41]I know it's starting at some point today.
[05:30.53]The next probably like half hour, hour.
[05:32.61]I definitely want to at least play a little bit and get ready.
[05:35.59]Because I don't want to get embarrassed on this stream.
[05:37.85]You know what I mean?
[05:44.51]Let me get in.
[05:45.99]Alright, let's do some... I'm going to do some 1v1s to warm up.
[05:51.84]Oh no, I'll do maybe free-for-all so people don't make fun of me.
[05:55.12]No, 1v1, let's go.
[05:59.86]Remove this.
[06:07.52]And... Hello.
[06:10.68]Look at that.
[06:13.11]I'll put the cam on in a minute.
[06:14.79]Alright, who should I play in the tournament?
[06:17.79]What do you think?
[06:20.67]How many turkeys could you fit in your garage?
[06:22.80]What are you talking about?
[06:23.92]What a weird question.
[06:25.50]I was going to say dumb.
[06:27.28]What a dumb question.
[06:31.04]Who should I play in the tournament?
[06:31.90]Alright, I got a good LeBron.
[06:33.80]I got a good Bugs.
[06:35.35]And I got a good Superman.
[06:36.59]We're not testing new characters today.
[06:40.61]Should I practice Bugs or practice Superman?
[06:46.09]I'm not going to play a character I haven't played with.
[07:01.67]Where's the handsome streamer?
[07:04.73]I'm working on it.
[07:08.02]Please play LeBron.
[07:08.82]Well, it depends on who my partner's playing.
[07:10.18]You want the camera?
[07:14.16]Fine.
[07:17.07]And it's against a Jake, right off the bat.
[07:18.73]Can't wait to get mad already.
[07:21.07]Alright, what... I need to put one on here.
[07:22.73]That one, definitely.
[07:27.33]Alright, these are practice rounds.
[07:28.65]I'm not going to get mad.
[07:30.71]I'm not going to get pissed off.
[07:31.60]This is warm-up rounds.
[07:35.90]Greasy... Greasy Gary.
[07:40.12]Villain hair.
[07:45.78]You have copper hair.
[07:47.04]It kind of is.
[07:48.92]It does look like it's made out of fucking like aluminum.
[07:52.62]All right, here we go.
[07:53.58]Say, Doc, did you see a carrot around here?
[07:56.77]One, two, three, go.
[08:00.81]Special delivery.
[08:28.61]What
[09:02.44]Big point for Red.
[09:05.51]Time to use a little strategy.
[09:40.68]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[09:52.21]Shut up.
[10:07.67]Finally the guy goes flying like a hundred years
[11:07.01]Oh my God, he almost just dropped down on himself.
[11:11.07]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[11:11.79]Check it out.
[11:14.33]This first match I played in two weeks.
[11:16.43]Relax.
[11:19.44]That's the first match I played in two and a half weeks.
[11:21.06]Relax.
[11:22.94]I'm going to take a day long nap.
[11:27.54]Your hair is greasier than my McDonald's order.
[11:30.98]Yeah.
[11:32.21]It's because I... Dude, what do you think I do in the morning?
[11:39.99]I go get the vegetable oil and I like... Then I just go like... I don't do that.
[11:53.99]Don't... That's a joke.
[11:55.33]Please don't actually do that.
[12:01.94]I believe that.
[12:03.60]Please don't do that.
[12:05.98]Alright, we got one.
[12:07.76]That was a good match.
[12:08.30]That was a good fight.
[12:09.02]Let's do some Lebron.
[12:14.06]Vegetable oil.
[12:16.42]Your hair looks like a helmet.
[12:19.58]It's called getting out of the shower and just letting it dry.
[12:31.02]Need to practice bugs.
[12:33.42]I gotta just get back into the game, man.
[12:43.65]Dude, your brain is exposed.
[12:47.03]What do you mean?
[12:47.59]Like, right here?
[12:48.51]Like... Hold on, let me jump in.
[12:54.13]I gotta get in my Discord call.
[13:00.72]I think I'm going Superman.
[13:01.86]I think I'm going straight up Superman.
[13:09.20]Your hair looks fine.
[13:10.06]No, I know.
[13:12.46]It's shiny because of the light.
[13:13.57]I got a light in my face, man.
[13:18.03]Alright.
[13:18.93]That was a good fight against Jake the dog.
[13:27.01]Okay.
[13:27.53]I'll probably get this one more in.
[13:29.62]Alright, let's make this a good one.
[13:30.44]Here we go.
[13:30.92]Ready?
[13:31.10]Let me just turn around and not look the other way.
[13:32.30]Boy, check this out.
[13:33.14]Ready?
[13:33.59]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[13:41.87]You... I didn't want to do that.
[13:45.37]I don't think I'm warming up now.
[14:06.88]What?
[14:07.56]Nobody sees that coming.
[14:08.40]Give me a break.
[14:17.74]Huh?
[14:27.02]Oh, that was pretty risky.
[15:12.96]Oh, that would've been good.
[15:24.36]Got it.
[15:35.75]Oh, come on Gwyn.
[15:47.40]One for blue.
[15:49.66]Ugh, what's up that?
[16:18.12]Oh, I thought he was going to jump.
[16:41.35]What?
[16:42.09]Sorry.
[16:42.37]Sorry.
[16:42.61]We're good.
[16:42.83]We're good.
[16:43.15]We're good.
[17:18.46]I didn't dodge through that?
[17:20.55]Holy shit!
[17:21.75]How did I not dodge through the grab?
[17:25.71]I dodged through the grab.
[17:27.05]What?
[17:28.83]That was fucked up.
[17:32.60]What?
[17:32.88]What do you mean for the grab?
[17:36.26]I didn't dodge through it?
[17:40.52]I lost it pretty hard at the end there.
[17:41.76]It's alright.
[17:46.84]You actually threw?
[17:47.58]No, I just got comboed.
[17:51.54]Too much grease.
[17:58.98]It was the iframes.
[18:00.54]That was weird.
[18:01.86]I seriously thought I went right through it.
[18:03.32]That threw me off.
[18:05.42]I think... Wait, hold on.
[18:08.43]Wait, wait.
[18:08.71]I gotta put friend code stuff in.
[18:10.31]Hold on.
[18:12.84]Dude, you used to be good.
[18:13.48]What happened?
[18:14.24]This is the second game I played in three weeks.
[18:17.13]Banned that person for 700 days.
[18:25.91]What up?
[18:27.47]Let's see if you can... Can we hear Connor?
[18:29.27]Hello, can you hear me?
[18:30.27]By the way, guys, Connor Eats Pants is the teammate.
[18:32.53]Big reveal!
[18:33.93]Hello, it's me.
[18:37.79]Did they not know?
[18:38.63]Did they not know that until now?
[18:39.91]I don't think so.
[18:40.97]I think some people do, but not everybody.
[18:43.45]It was a secret.
[18:44.11]It was a big secret.
[18:46.20]So who do you play with?
[18:48.64]I play Tom and Jerry and I can play LeBron, Iron Giant.
[18:54.14]I can play a good bit of people, I think.
[18:55.96]I just lost two games in a row warming up I haven't played in like three weeks though so that's all right that's fine that's good oh how's it going gentlemen oh my god I thought that was you yeah I thought connor I thought you changed voices I was like what happened what's up man uh not much I made a song today yeah you were working on uh a music career right uh-huh and and uh and I'm proud of it and and that's and that's all so it's a great day for me
[19:23.54]Yeah, we're talking strategy.
[19:27.68]FL player, it's a whole thing.
[19:28.78]But anyway, I just need one of you guys to Discord stream if possible, just so I can see.
[19:34.50]It's also okay if it's super impossible, but I thought I'd throw it out there.
[19:39.50]Every time I've tried to do that, it crashes my OBS.
[19:41.78]It sucks.
[19:43.04]It's bad for you.
[19:43.76]Connor, what about you?
[19:44.66]Surely this won't crash my OBS.
[19:47.12]Surely not.
[19:51.47]I gotta get uh I gotta get your um friend code or friend name connor you have a bunch of friend names in general chat that you should add as well one sec wait there's friend codes or just names I think it's names right your wb name so should we be adding everybody he left I don't know
[20:16.25]He went to go hang out with his more popular friends.
[20:19.02]Let me add you.
[20:19.80]He went to go talk to Sykkuno.
[20:24.02]Alright, my name is like Scarlet Otter, like, I don't know, something.
[20:27.60]You'll see it.
[20:28.66]Scarlet Otter something?
[20:30.15]It's something weird.
[20:33.56]You could get like one free name change.
[20:36.08]Do you really?
[20:36.58]I think so.
[20:38.24]I sent you a request and then I'm going to... Should I add you to party?
[20:40.57]Should we be together in a party?
[20:43.61]I don't know.
[20:44.21]Oh, I see Scarlet Otter.
[20:51.39]There we go.
[20:52.05]Okay, cool.
[20:54.89]Yeah, someone took my username.
[20:58.02]So I had to be Connor from Dream SMP instead.
[21:02.70]Why is it recommending me Shaggy?
[21:04.48]Like I just downloaded the game 10 minutes ago.
[21:07.08]Try it out.
[21:08.21]You must have had some bad games.
[21:09.87]It was like, you should try out this guy instead.
[21:11.93]I did all right.
[21:12.71]I did okay.
[21:16.45]I love it.
[21:16.75]Do you like this game?
[21:17.31]Are you having fun?
[21:18.23]I think it's super cool.
[21:19.17]I like it a lot.
[21:22.01]Play Rindog.
[21:22.77]No, if we play Rindog, no one's going to watch us.
[21:24.75]They're going to be like, oh, these guys play Rindog.
[21:26.43]No one cares.
[21:27.11]All right, shoot.
[21:28.71]Superman or Bugs?
[21:29.35]What do you think?
[21:31.83]Which one do you like more?
[21:33.47]I don't know.
[21:33.87]I feel like I like Bugs, but I feel like I'll go.
[21:36.61]Okay, we're going with Bugs.
[21:40.03]So now I think we have to change to a custom game, right?
[21:44.27]I don't know.
[21:45.25]Do we practice or do we just immediately jump into it?
[21:49.11]Let's see what Lubbock says.
[21:53.42]I got my tea.
[21:55.51]You have tea?
[21:56.81]Yeah, green tea.
[21:59.34]I don't have any green tea.
[22:00.10]Green tea.
[22:01.92]I'm gonna be honest, I was gonna do, like, I was gonna plan a funny bit for you, so, like, you'd have, like, some funny jokes where I was gonna put, like, Tom and Jerry's sound effects on the soundboard.
[22:10.17]Oh, that would have been pretty funny.
[22:11.97]And then, uh, it turns out I misplanned my timing for this, and I thought this started in an hour.
[22:17.01]And so I was actually doing my one, like, contractual Dream SMP thing for, like, a month.
[22:23.82]For a little bit.
[22:24.70]Well, I promise you I don't have, I have literally no gags ready for this stream.
[22:30.02]I don't have any.
[22:30.78]None.
[22:31.20]Okay.
[22:32.77]so I have zero two yeah none okay we'll think of it if you think of something like you know like give a hint and I'll like try to I'll hit the layup like we'll we'll make a good joke all right well if we win a game what I need you to say something okay I'll think of something like um do you have a good bugs bunny impression um
[22:58.22]That's pretty good.
[22:59.50]That was like a bugs.
[23:00.64]That was like kind of bugs with his arms in the air.
[23:02.28]Like, yeah, whatever.
[23:03.66]Okay.
[23:05.87]Because if we win a game, we both have to say like, yeah, what's up, doc?
[23:10.15]At the same time.
[23:10.99]It's very important.
[23:11.77]It's incredibly important.
[23:15.67]We have to go and join their voice call immediately.
[23:21.64]I'm not going to leak anything, but it's very important that we do that.
[23:25.34]Yeah.
[23:26.02]Don't tell anyone or else they're going to kick us out.
[23:27.94]Don't tell anybody.
[23:28.60]Bad sportsmanship.
[23:30.28]Should we do like a just a warm up round?
[23:33.42]Yeah, let's go on.
[23:34.44]Let's do a random team online.
[23:36.04]Let's see how it goes.
[23:37.60]I think we're on it already.
[23:38.58]Watch us do that.
[23:39.16]And they're like, hey, where you guys at?
[23:42.14]That's what always happens.
[23:44.84]You played Fortnite, the Ludwig Fortnite thing, right?
[23:47.34]Yeah, that's the first time I've ever installed Fortnite.
[23:50.46]Fortnite's awesome.
[23:51.14]You should join me for Fortnite Friday sometime.
[23:54.78]Is it fun?
[23:56.30]I love Fortnite.
[23:56.96]I think it's the best game.
[23:59.51]Do you, okay, is that, do you ironically but unironically like it?
[24:03.01]I unironically think it's a really fun game.
[24:04.93]Like, if you just, if you just enjoy it casually with friends.
[24:07.80]Okay.
[24:09.90]And it's also just cool because you just start seeing so many different characters in it.
[24:13.83]You're like, oh, here's Goku, and then there's LeBron James, and then there's Will Smith.
[24:19.34]Yeah, I made this reference a while back.
[24:21.58]Do you remember the old Smash Brothers Brawl character leaks?
[24:25.31]yeah that is fortnite like the one that's just like a giant jpeg you can't even tell like what the characters are the one with the one with like al bundy on it yeah it's like that's what fortnite is now yep fortnite's great I'm warning you all right let's let's go for it get a warm up here got my eye on you oh man
[24:48.89]So did they change any of the characters yet so far?
[24:51.68]I think they've done some nerfs and some buffs.
[24:54.70]At least someone in chat knows.
[25:02.36]Was that you or was that actually Buck?
[25:04.62]It was just me.
[25:09.62]To be honest, I almost just lost this point.
[25:14.66]It's fine.
[25:15.16]We beat these guys.
[25:18.51]There's no way you can lose to a guy named Fierce Day Mantis 333.
[25:21.37]That's like... Are you sure?
[25:23.02]Fierce Day Mantis taken?
[25:25.36]I mean, my name is Scarlet Otter.
[25:27.84]That's just like the default Xbox name.
[25:30.56]Oh, it must just be a default name, yeah.
[25:37.94]Oh, we're so much better though.
[25:40.18]Stop it.
[25:43.24]Acme coming in.
[25:45.70]Oh, that was actually pretty sweet.
[25:47.59]Oh.
[25:49.36]Oh, there's no way he's gonna make it.
[25:50.46]We're so much better.
[25:54.14]Who do you play in Smash Bros.
[25:55.51]usually?
[25:56.63]Um... Lucas.
[25:59.61]Oh, okay.
[26:00.23]But, I mean, I don't play Smash Bros.
[26:01.41]anymore.
[26:04.34]I stopped playing pretty much at... Yeah, I want your opinion on this, because everyone thinks I'm a nutcase for saying this.
[26:12.27]So, the new Smash Bros., since after Brawl, has started doing this thing that I just can't get over.
[26:19.47]And people go, what are you talking about?
[26:20.58]Until they actually pay attention the next time I play it.
[26:23.50]There are so many fucking particle effects in the new games that I can't even tell who's playing the game.
[26:30.60]it's just when you when you hit anybody when you move when you when you do a move when you jump it's just like explosions of like purple green and like orange colors all over the whole screen you'll notice it next time um uh 20. okay yeah it starts to get that way once you get that edge I'm telling you I'm gonna you people are gonna start to pay attention
[26:55.80]I believe you.
[26:56.98]I thought you were just going to say it because Melee's better.
[26:58.68]I was like, yeah, no, you're right.
[27:00.20]No, but if you watch Melee and then watch the new ones.
[27:03.54]True.
[27:03.93]You watch Melee and you're like, wow, this game looks great.
[27:06.37]But there's not a bunch of like... I'm telling you, I put on frame by frame on stream of somebody doing a single attack in Smash Brothers.
[27:17.11]And everyone was like, question marks, question marks.
[27:18.79]And then I saw like at least two to three hundred trues.
[27:21.11]That's the worst is when you know you're right and everybody keeps question mark spamming anyways.
[27:27.15]I know I'm right.
[27:27.73]I don't need their opinion and they're just question marking just to be different.
[27:34.99]I like Smash Brothers though.
[27:36.29]I think the game is fantastic.
[27:38.31]I don't know.
[27:39.13]It's like too much.
[27:41.76]Especially when you play with more than 1v1.
[27:43.12]It's just like, I don't even know what's even going on.
[27:47.10]Yeah, yeah.
[27:49.38]I've got my own opinions on Smash Bros, but if I get into it, I'll be ranting for like an hour.
[27:54.51]We gotta let this run out.
[27:57.61]Hop on General.
[27:58.95]I think they're starting.
[28:00.17]Going to General?
[28:00.83]Alright, let's go General.
[28:02.45]Can I give a speech?
[28:06.59]I will be... Is that a sheep?
[28:07.53]No?
[28:07.65]No?
[28:13.12]I will be shuffling the seeding.
[28:15.06]You will find out who you are playing in this event in just a few moments.
[28:18.32]First seed plays eighth seed, so on.
[28:21.19]It is a double elimination tournament.
[28:23.11]So if you lose, you're not out unless you lose twice, then you're out.
[28:27.64]Get the hell out.
[28:28.88]Should I back out?
[28:31.24]Right now, it doesn't super matter, but just listen to what I'm saying.
[28:34.20]What?
[28:34.62]Dude.
[28:35.40]Okay, what's up?
[28:36.16]Yeah, you're fine.
[28:36.74]You're fine.
[28:37.46]It is an eight-person double elimination bracket with $15,000 of prize money on the line out of my pocket.
[28:42.34]$15,000?
[28:42.36]Really?
[28:42.52]Yes.
[28:42.60]$8,000 for first place, $4,000 each, $5,000 for second place, $2,500 each, and then a final third place match.
[28:55.22]for $2,000 total.
[28:55.82]$1,000 each.
[28:55.96]Nice.
[28:56.08]All right.
[28:56.44]So $15,000 paid out net 735 days.
[28:57.58]And what we're going to do right now is shuffle the seating to see who you are all playing.
[29:10.59]Real quick, before we jump in, do not start your next match even if your opponent's ready until I tell you.
[29:16.20]So we're going to do all the matches at the same time, if that makes sense.
[29:18.94]And so some people might need to catch up.
[29:20.80]I'll just put it in the general chat.
[29:23.28]Seating is now getting shuffled.
[29:24.42]I'm sharing it on Discord if you guys want to take a look.
[29:27.67]I want to take a look.
[29:28.32]I want to take a look.
[29:29.28]Hop in.
[29:29.50]Hop in.
[29:29.86]Because I'm clicking the button right now.
[29:34.50]Seeding has been finalized.
[29:36.99]Oh, the big dogs.
[29:38.31]Here are the matchups.
[29:39.13]You guys can enter your own Discord call, but this is who you need to match up against.
[29:43.30]It is Stanz versus Alpharad, or Stanz and Alpharad versus Sasan and Nessoa.
[29:48.02]That's matchup one.
[29:48.68]You guys can now go to your Discords.
[29:50.05]Oh, here we fucking go, dude.
[29:52.17]Do we all get into the same Discord?
[29:54.03]Do we all get into the same Discord?
[29:55.27]You can if you want to set it up and then go back to your own, but when you're playing, just be in your own Discord.
[29:59.95]And make sure to also be Discords sharing your gameplay.
[30:03.53]What if your Discord chat's full of people who won't stop talking in your ear?
[30:07.74]Then that's a mod problem.

[31:53.66]Let's do it specifically because I think this was interesting.
[31:55.90]Hasan Nesua stands out for it.
[31:57.34]I think Nesua is the best player in this event.
[32:00.28]I think Hasan is the worst player.
[32:02.32]He's not better than me.
[32:03.77]I gotta pee.
[32:04.13]I'll be right back.
[32:05.11]Hey.

[32:14.91]I missed my opportunity to ask him because he went pee.
[32:18.15]No way.
[32:20.65]Was it embarrassing?
[32:22.61]Nobody responded?
[32:23.37]Yeah, alright.

[33:42.00]Works are fine.
[33:42.74]Okay.
[33:43.72]Hey, another question here.
[33:45.58]Maps.
[33:46.34]Are any maps off limits?
[33:49.50]Maps?
[33:51.05]People saying Scooby Doo off limits or we just keeping everything in?
[33:56.85]I think we go hog wild.
[34:00.01]Just anything.
[34:01.95]In your counter pick.
[34:04.41]It's a good point, Jeremy.
[34:05.75]You brought up a great point.
[34:07.43]You brought up an excellent point.
[34:08.83]There are three maps that are fine.
[34:10.01]Keep them all in.
[34:10.51]Keep them all in.
[34:10.99]Just keep all maps in?
[34:11.85]You got it.
[34:12.49]We fear nothing but God.
[34:13.90]And this is unlimited time, no hazards, and four ring outs, right?
[34:18.66]Seven minutes for time.
[34:19.60]Seven minutes for time, no hazards?
[34:23.30]Ooh, yeah, no hazards, no hazards.
[34:25.00]You got it.
[34:25.36]All right, cool.
[34:26.20]Thanks.
[34:30.48]All right, we're good.
[34:32.18]These are the rules that you see on the screen right now.
[34:34.44]And by the way, all maps are in.
[34:36.96]All maps, including Scooby-Doo.
[34:38.68]All maps, including Scooby-Doo.
[34:40.66]All right.
[34:41.36]Random or what?
[34:43.40]All right.
[34:43.72]I thought we were playing regulation, but okay.
[34:45.64]We'll play Ludwig's Fun Rules.
[34:47.52]It's four ring outs?
[34:48.70]And then... Seven minutes.
[34:50.24]Okay.
[34:51.52]But what if both teams decide no Scooby-Doo?
[34:55.18]Are we banning anybody?
[34:56.52]I'll do Scooby-Doo.
[34:57.75]I don't think so.
[35:00.01]Is there enough people for bands?
[35:01.65]I don't even know.
[35:03.25]People call me Question Andy.
[35:04.95]This is a $15,000 tournament.
[35:07.57]I don't want to screw this up.
[35:09.53]There's no details, and a lot of it is really bad at running tournaments.
[35:11.93]I'm going to have to ask him again.
[35:12.99]I don't know.
[35:14.25]Question Andy.
[35:18.47]Oh, is there announcements?
[35:19.31]What is this?
[35:19.87]All characters?
[35:20.51]Okay, right here.
[35:21.27]All perks are totally fine.
[35:22.29]All stages...
[35:23.56]loser picks map what question you know dude shut up seven minutes four stocks best of three what do you guys think loser picks map how do we know which one of us is the loser was it random they put a loser in the oh was it just seated that way I guess which one of us is the loser wait I don't think we even pick maps do we I don't think so
[35:45.91]It says loser picks maps.
[35:47.09]I'm having a panic attack.
[35:49.31]Maybe we don't rematch.
[35:51.03]I'm assuming I'm not the loser.
[35:53.39]It has to be one of you guys.
[35:54.63]I don't care about maps, but it's up to you guys.
[35:57.02]It doesn't bother me at all.
[35:59.20]I don't care.
[35:59.74]I'm fine with whatever.
[36:00.48]Good luck, guys.
[36:01.42]Have fun at all.
[36:01.90]Good luck.
[36:08.29]So are we going to be in the same call?
[36:09.86]Like talking shit?
[36:10.98]I think we're going to go separate because I mean, you know, hidden strategies.
[36:16.82]Yeah, that's true.
[36:18.56]Alright, have fun guys.
[36:20.04]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[36:22.76]See you tomorrow.
[36:24.26]Hopefully I'll see you tomorrow.
[36:28.22]What the hell?
[36:29.12]Something just popped in this room.
[36:30.31]Something popped?
[36:32.03]Yeah, I just heard like a pop noise.
[36:33.89]It wasn't like your graphics card, right?
[36:37.78]That would be the first time my computer's blown up while in a Ludwig tournament.
[36:40.64]That would actually be the third time that's happened.
[36:43.16]Which is pretty impressive that that only happens with Ludwig.
[36:46.24]Er, Connor.
[36:47.18]Hello.
[36:48.40]Discord screen share.
[36:56.51]Oh.
[36:58.53]Maybe he wants to chat and it's just like, oh, you know.
[37:01.13]He's just coming in with some rules.
[37:03.37]Yeah, how about you share your Discord screen, Connor?
[37:05.44]Okay, fine.
[37:09.52]All right.
[37:10.28]We think Bugs and Tom and Jerry?
[37:11.26]Or do you think that's too... I think so.
[37:12.81]I think we win with that.
[37:15.21]Very, very interesting question.
[37:16.23]What are we going to do with our money?
[37:19.27]Well, no.
[37:19.59]You're telling me to give a question.
[37:20.91]No, no, no, no, no.
[37:21.97]Is Tom and Jerry part of the Looney Tunes?
[37:25.23]No.
[37:25.65]No.
[37:25.91]No, no, no.
[37:27.13]So they're just completely separate?
[37:29.33]Yeah.
[37:30.83]Were they part of a different Tom and Jerry universe?
[37:32.63]Because there's these merry melodies, right?
[37:35.93]I think Tom and Jerry was...
[37:39.46]I don't know, actually.
[37:40.04]I don't know how that works.
[37:41.14]MGM, right?
[37:42.30]Looney Tunes had a similar one with Sylvester and Tweety Bird, right?
[37:46.61]Yeah, because the Looney Tunes... Yeah, Tom and Jerry MGM, apparently.
[37:51.53]So what else is under MGM?
[37:57.43]I don't know.
[37:57.91]I mean, I thought they're all owned by the same thing now, aren't they?
[38:01.82]Yeah, they're all under the one umbrella.
[38:04.68]Animaniacs?
[38:05.58]I like the Animaniacs.
[38:09.17]The Wizard of Oz.
[38:09.71]If you could play as the Tin Man, that would be amazing.
[38:15.51]Just put them all in.
[38:19.79]Tom and Jerry were Hanna-Barbera.
[38:23.24]Really?
[38:26.52]Interesting.
[38:32.92]Yeah, Metroid, Goldman, and Mayer.
[38:36.05]I watched so much Tom and Jerry as a kid, it was my favorite thing.
[38:40.67]I was a Looney Tunes guy.
[38:42.43]Daffy Duck.
[38:42.97]Yeah.
[38:43.87]I also did like the Looney Tunes.
[38:45.17]I had the big VHS box set that had all of them.
[38:49.13]I would watch as a kid.
[38:51.35]It's crazy just how many episodes there are of all these old cartoons.
[38:54.59]So many.
[38:56.01]People think like, oh, Dragon Ball Z has... Dragon Ball has like fucking 700 episodes.
[39:00.37]You know how many episodes of the Looney Tunes, just Merry Melodies there are?
[39:02.79]Probably like 1,500.
[39:03.63]That's... a lie.
[39:08.49]That is more than Dragon Ball, I bet.
[39:09.98]Yeah, it's also a lie.
[39:10.96]I made it up, but it's probably something huge.
[39:13.50]The lawyers made them remove frying pan jokes in later seasons because, quote, kids could have access to frying pans.
[39:20.22]Oh.
[39:21.01]Yo.
[39:22.43]Yo.
[39:22.99]Apparently we can start now.
[39:24.29]Oh, we're starting now?
[39:25.45]Yep, yep.
[39:25.73]All right, good luck.
[39:26.49]Okay, cool.
[39:27.17]Good luck, good luck.
[39:32.99]Okay, so Jerma is wrong.
[39:34.27]There are only seven Looney Tunes episodes.
[39:39.88]uh sorry sorry this might be no no this this is not like try gun okay there this give me a break I think there's only seven a bunch of people are saying that now all right we're going with that same strat yep I'm ready all right let's go for it remember if we win I'm gonna do a countdown you're gonna say what's up doc okay oh yeah never
[40:04.84]You got what?
[40:05.92]Does not all players are ready?
[40:08.11]Oh.
[40:08.45]Oh, ready up.
[40:09.91]I think it's you.
[40:11.31]No, I'm ready.
[40:12.03]I think they need the ready.
[40:13.27]Oh.
[40:15.57]Oh, we need to do our perks.
[40:16.91]Right.
[40:17.53]Has anybody else in this whole tournament?
[40:18.53]I think we have the next screen that we do that on.
[40:22.41]I think it broke.
[40:24.51]Did it really break?
[40:25.93]I think so.
[40:28.61]Games in beta.
[40:31.25]Yeah, this definitely broke.
[40:33.79]they what does their screen look like oh hold on oh you could reset it try it again okay surely it works this time here comes the heat okay start again all right we should think about perks because I think I have if you say so we can do team perks right yeah yeah so it'll show you in this next screen what I run I think I got 20 percent like you really want
[41:04.15]Not really.
[41:06.33]This is what I run.
[41:07.13]I get projectile speed, which is good for Tom and Jerry.
[41:09.65]And the air moves is pretty good.
[41:15.26]And then the last one, air acceleration, I don't really care.
[41:17.54]Sometimes I do the 100 damage one is pretty good.
[41:22.22]I like this one.
[41:23.52]20% reduction to ground and wall bounce.
[41:25.22]So we're not just going to get bounced around.
[41:27.10]Oh, yeah.
[41:28.58]One additional damage.
[41:29.10]I'll run the speed one and you run the wall bounce.
[41:31.98]Because I think we still both get each other's perks.
[41:34.12]Yeah.
[41:34.50]I think if we have the same one, it doubles up.
[41:36.80]Yeah, it doubles it.
[41:37.56]All right.
[41:39.34]Well, let's go.
[41:39.90]I'm ready.
[41:41.12]Are they running Iron Giant?
[41:42.16]Okay.
[41:42.56]Okay.
[41:42.76]All right.
[41:45.24]They're doing Iron Giant.
[41:46.89]They might cheese us.
[41:47.71]Okay.
[41:48.03]They might cheese us here.
[41:49.85]Okay.
[41:54.36]Okay.
[41:54.68]All right, let's go.
[41:56.28]Let's go.
[41:56.58]I've seen you in these.
[41:57.82]All right, let's go.
[41:59.35]Try hard.
[41:59.71]Put your try hard shoes on.
[42:02.25]I'm going to taunt right off the bat.
[42:03.57]There we go.
[42:33.26]Oh, you didn't expect that one, did you?
[42:36.10]Oh, we're good.
[42:41.05]We're good.
[42:41.29]We're good.

[44:12.67]You're confident, LeBron?
[44:14.55]Everyone's saying, oh, no.
[44:25.88]Oh, no.

[44:27.98]We're going to be fine.
[44:29.04]Everything's going to be okay.
[44:33.73]Yeah, we got Iron Giant too.
[44:36.13]Loser picks stage.
[44:37.13]I don't care what stage we get.
[44:38.05]We'll win.

[44:41.25]That was like such a little goblin laugh.
[44:44.61]All right, we got it.
[44:45.14]We got it.

[46:06.60]He's right here.
[46:12.33]Sorry.
[46:15.85]Has their Bugs even taken much damage?
[46:17.63]I can't even tell.
[46:18.27]I don't think their Bugs has taken any damage.
[46:20.73]He said he was bad.
[46:21.43]I can't believe it.
[46:23.61]What's up, Doc?
[46:30.60]What?
[46:35.38]There's too many orange irons.

[47:11.78]We got to bully somebody.
[47:12.48]Bully somebody.
[47:12.88]Shit.
[47:14.26]All right.
[47:21.55]God, I hate this.
[47:22.75]This is so sad.
[47:23.77]It's all right.
[47:24.17]It's all right.
[47:24.57]We're good.
[47:24.79]We're good.
[47:26.03]Wait, wait.
[47:27.07]Is it best of three?
[47:28.19]I think it's best of three.
[47:29.25]You guys are down in loser's bracket, but no worries.
[47:31.74]Still a lot more gameplay played.
[47:35.40]Can we ban Iron Giant?
[47:37.56]No.
[47:39.06]All right.
[47:42.57]Well.
[47:44.87]All right.
[47:45.13]We just need to figure out a solution to our problem.
[47:46.81]I don't fucking care if we lost.
[47:48.05]I'm doing the joke.
[47:57.51]Well, if you catch me playing Rindog, I... dude.
[48:05.21]That's how you know I've lost it.
[48:06.23]These things are going to get to be like room champ.
[48:08.31]I want a nice ice cold carrot.
[48:12.75]You're eating a cold carrot?
[48:16.83]Yeah, we're going to bring it back and we're going to fucking do it.
[48:19.45]Oh, you're doing like a Bugs Bunny joke?
[48:27.43]We're going to dominate the next one.
[48:31.72]We should challenge them double or nothing.
[48:38.94]I'm going to play... Dude, I couldn't see.
[48:43.23]Yeah, I couldn't tell what was going on.
[48:44.43]Too many Iron Giants.
[48:46.87]Yeah, maybe I should have just stuck Tom and Jerry, but... Nah, it was a good play.
[48:50.81]I thought I had the better Iron Giant.
[48:52.47]I still think I did, I just...
[48:55.05]You know, there's a lot of input lag.
[48:57.35]Flick and I live, like, 15 minutes away from each other.
[49:00.64]It's like, you know, if we were closer, maybe it'd be better.
[49:04.30]Yeah, I mean, well, here's the thing.
[49:06.26]Yeah, they're... Yeah, they had ping advantage.
[49:12.05]They had ping advantage.
[49:14.71]Hey, man.
[49:16.05]That was a good game, man.
[49:17.89]Is there more than, like, this best of three, or is that the only best of three?
[49:20.67]I mean, we can double or nothing if you want.
[49:23.39]I don't really see the point in that.
[49:26.39]They already just won, like, unanimously.
[49:28.23]I don't know why they would do that.
[49:30.07]Yeah.
[49:31.21]Yeah.
[49:32.23]Yeah.
[49:32.77]Were we supposed to lose the second one?
[49:34.17]I didn't even get the script.
[49:35.55]Yeah, you were... Well, that would have been ideal, but it's okay.
[49:39.03]Like, we... Germa had, like, a joke.
[49:42.43]No, it's okay.
[49:43.57]No, it's all good.
[49:44.13]It worked out.
[49:46.03]Did you guys get the joke off?
[49:47.94]Oh, yeah.
[49:48.38]No, it worked out good.
[49:50.14]Yeah.
[49:50.24]Yeah.
[49:51.21]yeah definitely yeah I yeah I mean I yeah I recommend yeah probably play iron giant so yeah next time you guys gotta send me the joke before yeah oh we didn't give you the script oh that's on me I apologize I was in charge of that and I made a mistake I made an error okay anyways I hope you guys win big you guys are you guys did really good and you you know you earned it yeah you know you guys played good you earned it you had really good bugs as well
[50:19.36]But GG's guys.
[50:20.66]GG's guys.
[50:21.52]Good games, seriously.
[50:23.34]Good games.
[50:24.32]Good luck in the tournament.
[50:25.63]You too.
[50:31.35]We should have done what's up doc.
[50:32.56]We should have what's up doctor right at the end.
[50:36.60]Just do it again.
[50:37.24]Well, these have to last the whole stream.
[50:42.70]I only have french fries.
[50:43.84]Is there a character that really likes french fries?
[50:47.67]Is there a character that's a french fry character?
[50:49.87]I don't know.
[50:50.19]I don't know.
[50:54.95]I'm trying to think if there's a... Oh, yeah, french fries.
[50:57.71]Popeye has spinach.
[51:01.47]Bugs has carrots.
[51:04.13]Rindog loves french fries.
[51:06.39]Daffy has cocaine.
[51:08.61]What else?
[51:08.91]What are the other staples?
[51:11.81]Apparently Rindog loves french fries.
[51:13.67]Really?
[51:14.66]Yeah.
[51:15.30]That's what they're all saying.
[51:16.20]They're all big Rindog fans.
[51:19.18]Steven Universe likes fries?
[51:21.70]I am playing Steven Universe.
[51:23.70]Wait, you're not playing Steven Universe?
[51:25.47]I refuse.
[51:28.08]Why?
[51:28.40]I don't know.
[51:29.65]There was a kid in my high school that really liked Steven Universe, and they were annoying to me.
[51:33.97]So just ever since, I was like, I just didn't ever want to think about Steven Universe.
[51:38.37]I haven't even unlocked them.
[51:39.31]I have like 30 character tokens, and that character is still just locked on my screen.
[51:43.60]So you get it then.
[51:44.42]Okay, so Connor gets it.
[51:46.44]Everyone thought I was crazy when I said this.
[51:47.82]Okay, when you play a game, like Multiverses or like Smash Brothers, whatever, that is a bunch of characters from different universes, different games, different TV shows.
[51:55.43]If you get your ass kicked by like a bunch of try-hards on a single character, right?
[52:01.71]Doesn't it make you hate the fucking show?
[52:05.35]Oh, a thousand percent.
[52:06.31]Right?
[52:06.73]The thing is, I just hated it prior.
[52:08.15]But yeah, no, you're right about it, though.
[52:09.73]Like if they start pissing me off like that, there's no chance I'm ever playing a Fire Emblem game in my life.
[52:14.27]That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[52:15.99]I went up against a bunch of Finns and Jakes that I got just dominated by probably dozens of times.
[52:20.90]And it genuinely makes me not want to watch Adventure Time ever again.
[52:25.25]Yeah, I don't blame you.
[52:26.57]It's starting to piss me off.
[52:27.68]Like, I don't even like Finn as a character anymore.
[52:30.92]I just think about him, like, spinning his backpack around, and I'm like, yeah, it's not entertaining.
[52:35.80]You guys talking about me again?
[52:37.28]Yeah.
[52:39.18]Oh, you ready to boot up?
[52:40.95]You guys are going up against Lily and Michael.
[52:42.75]All right, let's do it.
[52:44.13]I'm such a big fan.
[52:47.01]they add us uh we're gonna add uh we're gonna pop it all if they're not doing it offer it everyone's thing is in general too as well yeah I'll add them right now okay cool cool cool how are you ludwig I'll be deafened all right let me add do some adding here
[53:15.85]Let me make sure I get this right.
[53:20.65]I probably should tell it because this is a random fucking weirdo that's like, oh, Scarlet Otter is adding you.
[53:25.41]That's not me.
[53:25.85]You know what I mean?
[53:26.29]I should probably tell them.
[53:27.35]Fake Scarlet Otters everywhere.
[53:33.94]The guy who took my name, like, felt bad about it.
[53:36.18]And then, like, so I added Conner Eats Pants on here.
[53:38.88]And then they changed their name to, like, I don't know how to fix.
[53:43.52]And then I tried to change it back to Conner Eats Pants.
[53:46.44]And then the name is still, like, gone.
[53:48.36]It's just, like, removed from the pool of names now.
[53:50.50]Dude, did you see what I just wrote in the general?
[53:51.90]Like, I don't even know my own user.
[53:54.78]I'm Scarlet Otter and some numbers.
[53:57.37]I genuinely don't know what it is.
[53:58.93]It's on the screen.
[53:59.61]It's 505.
[54:00.81]Is it?
[54:01.81]Yeah, it's right below.
[54:03.17]Yeah.
[54:07.03]Gemma just posted lewd photos in the general chat.
[54:10.18]I can't believe it.
[54:11.28]All right, let me get Michael.
[54:15.66]Oh, that was Lily that added me.
[54:16.90]I was like, wow, that person's got the $100 edition of the game and they tried to add me.
[54:21.09]I should have known considering their name was Lily.
[54:25.03]How many L's is this?
[54:29.65]I hope I got that right.
[54:32.77]That was like, yeah, Michael's name.
[54:37.52]There you go.
[54:40.14]All right.
[54:41.22]Profile pics.
[54:42.09]I can't believe we're getting some e-daters, dude.
[54:43.59]All right, here we go.
[54:45.21]We're good.
[54:46.29]Yep.
[54:46.43]All right.
[54:50.15]No hazards.
[54:50.72]Seven minutes, four ring outs.
[54:51.96]All right.
[54:52.20]All the maps are good.
[54:53.00]All right.
[54:53.28]So I'm going, I'm going bugs again.
[54:54.78]Dude, just use your main.
[54:57.20]Yep.
[54:57.74]I'm ready.
[55:00.63]I can't believe the matching profile pics.
[55:02.19]We got to one-up that.
[55:03.80]Do you want to do... I don't know.
[55:06.40]Do you have the LeBron profile picture?
[55:09.28]The basketball?
[55:11.46]No.
[55:12.46]No.
[55:16.30]I have the... Just copy theirs.
[55:18.16]Just copy?
[55:19.40]Put on those Steven Universe stars.
[55:23.82]Oh, wait, it doesn't change it.
[55:24.64]No, it doesn't change it.
[55:26.18]Oh, I thought you didn't like Steven Universe, though.
[55:27.92]I thought you didn't like it.
[55:28.58]I just wanted to, like, scare them.
[55:29.58]I just wanted to, like, match their profile pics, so then we could, like, maybe get in their head a little bit.
[55:40.03]Why is my voice pitched up?
[55:43.53]It is now.
[55:44.37]I think they mean, like, when I talk.
[55:46.57]Oh, no, it is now, though.
[55:48.23]Oh.
[55:49.55]It is, right?
[55:50.89]Yeah, you're, like, you're more than pitched up.
[55:52.83]You're, like...
[55:54.52]Like a bit of robot pitched up.
[55:57.92]Dude, yeah, I gotta go XLR.
[55:59.46]It's fucking cool.
[56:01.30]No, wait, hold on.
[56:02.05]I got... I got like this.
[56:06.49]I don't know.
[56:07.03]There we go.
[56:08.39]Should we just keep this on?
[56:12.91]Should we just... Should we keep it on?
[56:16.43]Sure.
[56:18.78]Let's go.
[56:19.16]Let's go for it.
[56:20.42]Let's go now.
[56:23.42]Dude funny voices stream.
[56:25.35]Yes, people love that.
[56:31.63]I'm glad you understand like the the rhythm of like, oh, we're stuck on the waiting screen.
[56:35.91]And I don't know what to do for the stream.
[56:37.23]I'm just gonna start pressing buttons on the go XLR.
[56:40.64]Yeah, that's kind of how it goes.
[56:42.06]These cards are just good.
[56:44.08]By the way, you gotta start having carrots on command.
[56:46.88]That's a good idea.
[56:50.05]Are you eating carrots and playing Bugs Bunny?
[56:52.01]That was a joke and we lost.
[56:55.43]I got these big ass Omega carrots and it was going to be like, oh, we're going to win with Bugs and it's going to be funny.
[57:00.00]It's not funny.
[57:01.80]Do you have like a Bugs catchphrase you can do on command?
[57:04.76]What's up, dog?
[57:05.62]Yeah, I'll give it to you.
[57:08.97]You give it to me.
[57:10.21]Yeah.
[57:11.51]What's up, doc?
[57:13.79]That was pretty good.
[57:14.51]That was phenomenal, German.
[57:15.79]That was a pretty good one.
[57:17.93]I like it.
[57:18.27]That was genuinely great.
[57:20.09]I like it.
[57:23.53]You guys waiting to start?
[57:24.84]Peter Griffin.
[57:29.12]Yeah, we're ready.
[57:29.62]We're ready to go.
[57:30.46]Yeah, you're Bugs Bunny and I'm like Peter Griffin trying to do a Bugs Bunny.
[57:40.85]That's going to be in my head now.
[57:41.73]You guys fucked me up.
[57:42.51]We're going to lose.
[57:46.07]They should add Peter.
[57:47.23]Yeah, they should.
[57:48.07]What does it sound like with the filter on?
[57:53.15]Um... Yeah.
[57:54.79]What's up, Doc?
[57:57.07]What's up, Doc?
[57:59.65]Are we supposed to play?
[58:01.68]What's up, Doc?
[58:06.18]What's up, Doc?
[58:09.04]It just sounds like you're going like... Like you just ate a fucking, like, hot fucking Cheetos.
[58:17.25]Should we go?
[58:17.83]Are we ready?
[58:19.13]I don't know.
[58:19.61]I don't know.
[58:20.97]Did he say?
[58:23.33]Ludwig.
[58:24.01]Did he say go?
[58:25.63]I think he said go.
[58:28.39]I think we go.
[58:29.53]Are we going to go?
[58:33.91]Go.
[58:34.15]Go?
[58:34.57]Well, I see like the other streams look like they're playing.
[58:38.66]All right, let's go.
[58:43.25]You guys can start.
[58:44.55]Oh, yeah.
[58:46.11]Oh, okay.
[58:46.71]Just getting some lag.
[58:50.25]Yeah, game is just lagging a little bit.
[58:55.85]There's a lot of Scarlet Otters online.
[58:58.21]It's kind of messing with the netcode.
[59:02.31]Oh, shit.
[59:02.73]They're in-universe.
[59:03.53]They get 10% damage buff.
[59:05.59]Is that real?
[59:06.71]Yeah.
[59:08.22]Oh, man.
[59:09.38]So if we don't get the Scooby-Doo stage, then they're going to be triple buffed.
[59:16.30]All right.
[59:17.66]Let's just make it happen.
[59:18.38]Let's go.
[59:18.68]You ready?
[59:18.90]Want to have a sip of green tea?
[59:20.90]Yep.
[59:22.06]We're not going to be on the stage too, right?
[59:31.93]Uh-oh.
[59:32.47]Are we on their stage?
[59:33.29]Oh, God.
[59:33.67]That's 20% damage.
[59:37.48]This might be rigged is what I'm thinking.
[59:38.96]I don't know if Ludwig can hear us, but I've heard that there's a conspiracy against us.
[59:43.06]Sometimes I heard people were saying that, mentioning that.
[60:18.18]Whoa.
[60:18.36]There it is.
[60:20.48]I got her.
[60:31.08]Get out of my hair, rabbit.
[60:37.38]It's so low.
[60:42.16]There it goes.
[60:46.85]Whoa!
[60:47.37]We're good.
[60:54.90]Oh my god, we're better, Jerma.
[60:57.24]Just keep it up.
[60:57.66]Don't say that.
[60:58.38]We don't know.
[60:59.54]It'll be a massive comeback.
[61:00.44]You don't know.
[61:08.74]Oh, that kills?
[61:10.04]Oh, they have the profile pick buff too.
[61:15.66]We're good.
[61:15.96]We're good.
[61:16.20]We're good.
[61:16.52]We're good.
[61:18.01]We're good.
[62:01.01]Oh my god, he's so slippery!
[62:11.93]So slippery!
[62:12.49]Alright, we got it, we got it, good, good, good.
[62:15.21]That was an accident, but it worked.
[62:18.73]Oh my goodness, we almost just got double taken out.
[62:21.38]That was almost so bad.
[62:25.70]One hit, one hit, one hit.
[62:35.06]Oh, just one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit.
[62:37.58]He's dead.
[62:38.22]Okay, we're good, good, good, good, good.
[62:40.98]We got one.
[62:42.22]What up, doc?
[62:42.96]What's up, doc?
[62:44.32]I just bit my tongue in half.
[62:45.46]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[62:53.10]Oh my god, I'm so happy.
[62:55.80]We did it.
[62:56.44]We got one.
[62:59.38]I screamed so loud.
[63:02.66]That was a really good match.
[63:04.72]They could have taken that any second.
[63:08.31]Yep.
[63:08.63]We played with heart, though.
[63:09.95]They could have taken that at any second.
[63:11.31]All right.
[63:16.59]Are we going to stick with what we have, or are we going to go change it up?
[63:20.03]I think we stick with it.
[63:23.05]If it works, it works, right?
[63:24.43]We've only been beaten by an iron giant.
[63:28.09]All right.
[63:28.87]Okay.
[63:32.98]I feel like my Bugs is off today.
[63:34.64]Maybe I'll go Superman.
[63:35.78]I feel off today too.
[63:37.26]Something's in the air.
[63:38.20]Yeah.
[63:45.89]Yeah, I'm sleeping on my Superman.
[63:47.53]My Superman's actually probably better than my Bugs.
[63:49.37]My Bugs aren't that great.
[63:51.33]Maybe time to bring out Superman next time.
[63:54.28]Do you have like a good Superman line?
[63:59.96]Yeah.
[64:02.29]Leave everything to me.
[64:03.81]Yeah.
[64:06.98]And then he goes down and he farts.
[64:09.50]Yeah.
[64:09.76]The only Superman media I've seen is the Zack Snyder movie.
[64:13.03]So he doesn't really do that.
[64:14.41]He's more like upset.
[64:40.99]Just be careful be careful
[65:04.40]Let's go.
[65:05.18]Wait a minute.
[65:05.74]There he is.
[65:06.26]It's a beta carotene, I think.
[65:10.14]Yep.
[65:10.52]I was deficient.
[65:12.48]Improved your eyesight.
[65:13.76]That's how parrots work.
[65:15.20]I mean, it's been like 20 minutes since I took the first bite, right?
[65:18.06]Yep.
[65:29.59]Oh, my God.
[65:30.23]Good game.
[65:30.75]You went off that game.
[65:31.49]I told you we got this.
[65:35.10]Something was in you.
[65:35.80]Might have been the carrots.
[65:37.52]You were an animal that round.
[65:39.24]The beta carrot team finally kicked in.
[65:42.12]Do you have a mouthful of carrots?
[65:44.25]Yep.
[65:45.61]I love that.
[65:46.47]Congratulations, you two.
[65:47.57]Great edge guard on the left side.
[65:48.77]Great win.
[65:49.99]And you're moving on.
[65:51.33]Good game.
[65:57.09]I just kind of popped off.
[65:59.60]I don't know what happened, man.
[66:01.66]Something got in you.
[66:05.44]They almost took that first game, though.
[66:06.98]That was good.
[66:07.46]That was a good match.
[66:08.84]Yep.
[66:10.14]Alright, so the biggest losers bracket run of all time is what people are saying is about to happen.
[66:17.36]Potentially the best losers run of multiverses history.
[66:19.92]What the fuck?
[66:20.56]I just look like an idiot.
[66:22.29]What?
[66:22.45]What's wrong?
[66:23.51]Look at the lobby.
[66:26.25]It looks like I did that and you didn't.
[66:28.17]And you were convincing me not to do that.
[66:31.45]Wait, you're still the skull for me.
[66:33.77]I'm not on my screen.
[66:35.93]Oh, that's embarrassing.
[66:37.20]No, but that's not supposed to be like that.
[66:38.54]That was something we did before.
[66:39.76]That's all right.
[66:41.80]Oh, come on.
[66:43.48]Like, wow, I can't believe this.
[66:45.02]This Scarlett Otter guy just changed his profile picture to ours.
[66:48.19]That was your fucking idea.
[66:53.01]I'm on the star now, too, for what it's worth.
[66:56.58]That's not what I... We were doing the thing... Why did it change now?
[66:59.97]Oh my god.
[67:01.33]I hope they understand that.
[67:02.47]Please, I hope they understand that.
[67:04.89]I'm not trying to be like Dick.
[67:07.29]Okay.
[67:13.99]That looks so bad.
[67:16.53]These french fries are pretty good.
[67:18.97]Dude, do you have any carrots?
[67:21.27]No.
[67:21.97]Really?
[67:23.21]No, I don't have any carrots.
[67:24.49]I'm telling you, that's what changed.
[67:27.10]I think I do need some.
[67:28.94]Oh wait, there it goes.
[67:29.56]It changed back.
[67:32.05]Oh, now I have the star.
[67:37.31]Stop making enemies?
[67:38.05]I'm... They're awesome people!
[67:40.46]What are you talking about?
[67:48.83]Did you ever tell them the story of you meeting Mr. Beast?
[67:52.31]No.
[67:53.78]Because I told it.
[67:55.88]I told from my perspective that story.
[67:57.70]It was really funny.
[68:00.40]You can tell it.
[68:01.28]Sorry.
[68:01.75]Yeah.
[68:02.49]So we...
[68:04.33]So I took Jerma to the Ninja Mr. Beast event, the League of Legends event, and we go backstage to Mr. Beast's team room, and it's just a few people in there, and I was like, okay, Jerma, you can say hi to Mr. Beast.
[68:19.58]Now, Mr. Beast was very much hyper-focused on League mode.
[68:24.14]He was only posting that looking at his iPad or whatever looking over game plans.
[68:27.35]And they were sitting on the couch and Jerma goes like, I think you said something like, hey, I'm Jerma.
[68:32.19]And like, he didn't say anything.
[68:35.53]Like, he was just there, and I was like, oh, no.
[68:37.97]And I was like, hey, Jimmy, Jimmy, like, this is Jerma.
[68:40.41]Like, he's a YouTuber.
[68:41.51]And he was like, oh, okay, hey, nice to meet you.
[68:44.10]And I was like, okay, well, kind of saved.
[68:47.30]And then I'm like, no, no, no, don't worry.
[68:48.64]He definitely, like, watched your TF2 videos.
[68:51.72]But he's a busy guy, right?
[68:53.21]He's a busy guy.
[68:54.43]He's a busy guy.
[68:56.69]But, you know, he knew who you were after.
[68:59.77]Well, even if he doesn't, that is fine.
[69:01.59]You can't expect everybody to know who you are.
[69:04.59]It was kind of funny, though.
[69:06.13]Yeah, it was probably funny.
[69:08.03]He's the sus guy.
[69:15.05]Tell me the sus guy.
[69:16.53]Yeah.
[69:18.06]He's the sus guy, right?
[69:19.12]Yeah.
[69:22.10]Okay, let me ask you something.
[69:23.96]Yeah.
[69:24.24]Would Mr. Beast know me more as the sus guy or as the guy that used to make TF2 videos like 12 years ago?
[69:31.42]I think, honestly, TFT videos.
[69:33.56]He's a very old school YouTube guy.
[69:35.60]He is, right?
[69:36.18]Isn't he?
[69:39.90]Maybe sus guy too, though.
[69:41.04]That might bring a few bells.
[69:42.44]How'd it even happen?
[69:46.73]I just remember randomly at some point, it was like sus was now associated with you.
[69:50.19]I don't know.
[69:52.59]Somebody made a meme.
[69:54.83]It was just like, oh, look, when the imposter is sus.
[69:56.89]And I put it on my screen for five seconds.
[69:58.58]That'll do it.
[70:01.92]Wasn't there the guy that like burned that image into his TV?
[70:03.88]Oh, yeah.
[70:07.95]That guy was full of shit, though.
[70:09.87]It's 10 years, not 12.
[70:13.35]Well, it's 2022 going into 2023.
[70:14.01]It'll be 11.
[70:14.25]Sorry.
[70:14.43]I've been making videos since 2007.
[70:31.24]How old were you?
[70:32.90]I was eight years old.
[70:34.81]What?
[70:36.33]I got a camcorder, my mom's camcorder, and I would use the macro function to zoom in from far away so the focus worked on my Nintendo DS Pokemon Diamond Wi-Fi battles.
[70:47.02]Wow.
[70:48.52]That's unbelievable.
[70:49.20]Eight years old.
[70:49.80]Yep.
[70:56.72]And I was bad.
[70:57.32]I was very bad at the game.
[70:58.24]And I didn't understand like how the, uh, the tiers worked.
[71:00.88]I'm like, why couldn't use certain Pokemon?
[71:02.66]Cause they were like too good.
[71:04.32]And so I would like join battles and they'd be like, you can't use this guy.
[71:07.32]And I would just be like, no, I'm using this like Jirachi.
[71:09.85]I want to use it.
[71:11.41]And it was just like a completely cheated Pokemon too.
[71:13.63]But I, I enjoyed it.
[71:15.87]You were like 60 when he was eight.
[71:17.29]No.
[71:19.67]Someone said, so that's why you were like this.
[71:21.79]Yeah, no, that is why.
[71:23.59]That's what happened.
[71:27.17]a kid I was pissed they didn't let me use charizard okay well you're just wrong because charizard's not even that good so he's never been banned I made that up acting like I don't know the tears of pokemon come on now what's your favorite pokemon favorite pokemon probably whooper who's whooper you don't know whooper I I all I know I know like 10 pokemon
[71:55.62]Okay.
[71:56.32]I know all of them.
[71:58.08]Oh, you do?
[71:58.53]Name all 150 original Pokemon right now.
[72:01.01]I honestly... There's a 20% chance you name a number of the first 150 and I might be able to tell you which one it is.
[72:07.71]Okay.
[72:09.45]Um... Eight.
[72:16.54]Vermillion.
[72:17.74]Hold on.
[72:18.28]I gotta get, like, a thing to see.
[72:21.04]Original... 150 Pokemon...
[72:26.94]And they're numbered?
[72:29.00]Yeah.
[72:30.35]Okay, let's see.
[72:33.03]That was a softball one, was it?
[72:34.59]Okay, hold on, let me see.
[72:35.87]Let me get the list here.
[72:37.11]Bit of a softball.
[72:38.27]Was it a softball?
[72:40.55]Yeah, because the first nine are all starters, right?
[72:43.09]And so I just remembered it started Bulbasaur, then it was Squirtle, and then it was Charmander.
[72:47.92]So then number eight would be Charmeleon.
[72:49.94]What?
[72:50.48]How do you know that?
[72:50.98]Okay, so hold on, I got one here.
[72:54.34]Alright, I'll give you a tough one.
[72:56.09]Oh, it's War Turtle?
[72:57.01]Oh, never mind.
[72:57.73]I messed up then.
[72:58.35]Oh, you messed up?
[72:59.55]Yeah.
[72:59.77]Alright, how about number 30?
[73:02.93]Um... I think
[73:14.19]I think Raichu's 26.
[73:16.03]God damn, I have to run.
[73:16.93]This is original 150 Pokemon according to my boyfriend.
[73:21.46]Oh.
[73:21.66]It's like they're all just fake names.
[73:23.66]Hold on.
[73:24.04]Oh, well, let me take, give me a hint as to what that one's boyfriend name is.
[73:29.76]They're blue?
[73:30.36]Oh, Nidorino.
[73:32.69]Nidorina, one of them.
[73:37.35]One of them, the one before it is, they call it Watermouse.
[73:41.91]It's a blue mouse.
[73:42.81]Oh, yeah.
[73:44.39]Nidorina.
[73:45.05]Okay, but the one after that is the one that's apparently 30.
[73:55.44]Wait.
[73:56.82]Nidoran is one of them.
[73:59.14]Okay.
[74:00.32]Oh, wait.
[74:00.62]Here's a list.
[74:00.96]Here's an actual list.
[74:01.81]Okay.
[74:01.93]How about 39?
[74:02.17]39.
[74:02.21]Do you want me to give you a hint?
[74:04.17]Yeah.
[74:04.31]Yeah.
[74:14.63]Oh, that's so much more than a hint.
[74:19.01]It's Jigglypuff.
[74:20.75]Oh, okay.
[74:21.15]Good.
[74:21.35]You got it.
[74:21.85]All right.
[74:22.07]What's the name of the Pokemon?
[74:23.65]What's 41?
[74:26.75]You said Jigglypuff was what?
[74:28.43]39.
[74:32.50]Trousy?
[74:33.86]Sorry.
[74:34.32]It's Zubat.
[74:36.08]Yep.
[74:36.86]Yeah.
[74:37.04]Okay.
[74:37.70]How about listen, I could at least name every Pokemon up to like, like, if I saw a silhouette, I can name I think almost every Pokemon.
[74:45.77]That's so cool.
[74:46.21]All right.
[74:46.59]What about who's 149?
[74:49.13]Not 150.
[74:49.79]We know what we all know who that is.
[74:51.35]And 49 is a dragon.
[74:53.83]Damn.
[74:54.15]Okay.
[74:54.37]What about 148?
[74:56.15]Dragon there.
[74:56.95]All right.
[74:57.21]What about 147?
[74:57.75]Keep it up.
[74:59.05]Dratini.
[74:59.65]Damn.
[75:00.05]Okay. 146.
[75:02.32]Articuno or Moltres?
[75:03.74]Moltres, you got it.
[75:04.58]145.
[75:04.90]Articuno.
[75:08.72]Very close.
[75:09.64]Yep.
[75:11.06]144 is Articuno.
[75:12.00]It's Articuno.
[75:12.76]And then before that would be... 143.
[75:17.27]Joltia?
[75:18.39]Mm-mm.
[75:19.09]Mm-mm.
[75:20.67]Is it one of the Eevees?
[75:22.53]Nope.
[75:22.73]I'll give you a hint.
[75:23.83]Very sleepy.
[75:28.13]Very sleepy.
[75:28.81]Oh, Snorlax.
[75:29.57]Snorlax.
[75:30.21]You got it.
[75:30.55]That's it.
[75:31.71]That's like Drowsy.
[75:32.27]I'm like, he's not that far up.
[75:33.41]Well, you got a lot in a row.
[75:35.08]That was impressive.
[75:36.66]No, yeah.
[75:37.06]You're like, this is really cool.
[75:38.44]But no, it was bad because like in school, all of my knowledge was just reserved for Pokemon information.
[75:43.28]And I did really bad because like my brain just wouldn't care about like knowledge I needed to know for tests.
[75:49.19]It was only reserved for Pokemon.
[75:53.23]Yeah, I mean, that's, I mean, you had an interest.
[75:56.72]Yeah, that's true.
[75:57.54]It ended up working out.
[75:58.70]Okay, but can you imagine if instead of just random stupid dumb math problems, they made it so like, oh, like Sally has five carrots.
[76:08.60]Jason has 15 carrots.
[76:10.12]Don't you think if they just made it like Squirtle has 15 carrots and Charizard has seven carrots that you would care more?
[76:15.84]You'd be like, oh, shit, Charizard's got carrots.
[76:20.23]Why don't they do that?
[76:21.63]I don't know.
[76:22.71]When I was in kindergarten, I went to a church school, and then they banned Pokemon right when I got there.
[76:28.55]They were like, you can't talk about Pokemon.
[76:30.86]And then my mom complained.
[76:32.02]It was like, my son likes this.
[76:33.30]He's going to talk about it.
[76:35.02]Sorry.
[76:35.50]And then I was allowed to talk about Pokemon during recess only.
[76:41.72]Only during recess, though.
[76:42.76]Not during school time.
[76:44.98]Not every kid likes Pokemon, though.
[76:46.46]Yeah, but couldn't you pull the class on a ranked system?
[76:50.50]Okay, you got the Looney Tunes.
[76:51.61]You got Rugrats, Ren and Stimpy, Steven Universe, whatever.
[76:56.97]Just have them rank how much they like it, and then base the whole curriculum.
[77:00.47]Just replace all the dumb, boring, like a train leaves...
[77:03.56]uh boston going you know 200 miles per hour you know to 10 miles to go visit uh new jersey right just make it like steven universe just traveling 200 miles per hour to go visit um charizard my son is not going to be learning from steven universe not on my watch it'll be it'll be bugs bunny it'll be tom and jerry it'll be ren and stimpy it'll be
[77:29.65]not that anything but that so they're moving way too fast and this is our next game so how are we just like ignoring people what's the deal I think we just been we were seated so high that we're waiting for our next game oh that makes sense like a bracket my physics teacher used to make tests with dragon ball characters yeah and did you get an a plus because you loved that anime
[78:00.41]I did not care for anime at all as a kid my friends really liked dragon ball a ton like they would always like play pretend and like be uh be dragon ball characters and so I watched the show and I didn't care about like the the super like sand characters so I found out there was a turtle like there's a character that just owns a turtle I think it's like an old man that has a pet turtle and so I would play pretend by just curling up in a ball on the ground and then being the turtle and that was how I had fun in that
[78:33.40]How long was your like recess?
[78:36.61]Like 20 minutes, 20 minutes.
[78:39.55]Yeah.
[78:45.54]This wasn't recess though.
[78:46.50]This was like, I wouldn't do that at school.
[78:48.26]Kids would have made fun of me.
[78:49.18]This was around close friends.
[78:53.81]Oh, okay.
[78:54.23]That hurt.
[78:55.09]Hold on.
[78:55.81]I'm just imagining you at recess.
[78:57.79]No, no, no, that would have been bad.
[78:59.07]It's really like, why is being a turtle at recess?
[79:02.01]No, no, no, that would have been bad.
[79:03.60]That would be like, I mean, who didn't do wait, you didn't do the let's pretend to be animals at recess.
[79:08.34]Yeah, well, maybe I think Yeah, I definitely did that.
[79:11.62]I think Yeah, that wouldn't be out of the ordinary.
[79:13.38]I know when my close friends like hang out their house, like our parents are hanging out, right?
[79:18.12]And so we're just upstairs playing pretend.
[79:20.82]And they play Dragon Ball.
[79:21.86]I'm like, Okay, I'll be the turtle.
[79:25.01]I I didn't care that's that's awesome you wait people in chatter are saying you know you know the things they usually say uh so wait there was not one point when you were younger at recess where you went around going like this with your arm going like I can't you know they're like an elephant like
[79:52.19]I mean, you didn't run around like an elephant or like a horse or something.
[79:54.79]Like, what are you talking about?
[79:55.59]Yes, you did.
[79:55.99]I don't know if I, yeah.
[79:59.21]I mean, I recall like doing the arm thing, I guess, to be an elephant, but I don't know if I like chose to be the elephant.
[80:03.85]That was never like one I went for.
[80:07.40]Like I'm a bear, like rawr.
[80:09.60]I didn't main elephant.
[80:10.66]I was more of like a cheetah guy or maybe a lion.
[80:13.66]Yeah.
[80:19.79]That's not furry behavior.
[80:21.65]That's just your, like, seven.
[80:25.31]Yeah, I want to know which furry is, like, an elephant.
[80:28.18]I've never heard of that before.
[80:31.60]Yeah, it definitely exists.
[80:37.06]My mane.
[80:37.80]I didn't mane elephant.
[80:43.81]But I did.
[80:49.25]Guys, I'm not streaming with a furry.
[80:50.59]It's okay, guys.
[80:52.15]Okay.
[80:56.16]What does this person say?
[81:02.08]Oh.
[81:03.72]Is pretending to be Sonic count?
[81:06.19]I think so.
[81:08.01]I love pretend to be Sonic.
[81:09.43]Yeah, but so what?
[81:10.05]So wait, how come?
[81:10.77]So when it's a cool animal, that's okay.
[81:13.73]But when it's an elephant, I'm the weird kid.
[81:15.31]What are you talking about?
[81:16.20]You're pretending to be a hedgehog running fast.
[81:18.26]Sonic's like super fast, though.
[81:19.98]And elephants are really slow.
[81:22.26]So?
[81:24.16]Like, that makes Sonic cooler, though.
[81:27.03]He's like the fastest thing ever.
[81:30.01]But it's still a hedgehog.
[81:33.07]It's like a different though.
[81:34.97]Like if you saw like a real hedgehog next to Sonic, you'd be like, yeah, those are two different things.
[81:43.34]Yeah, that's true.
[81:46.08]Even Sonic doesn't pretend to be a hedgehog.
[81:49.97]Yeah, I don't even know if he is, honestly.
[81:51.99]He might just be insane and thinks that he is.
[81:55.71]We pretended to be Dragon Ball characters.
[81:57.21]Step up your game.
[81:58.71]Yeah, but there's all kinds of fun media to pretend to be.
[82:05.50]When are they going to add John Oliver to the game?
[82:07.38]He is Warner Bros.
[82:08.35]now.
[82:09.71]That'd be cool.
[82:10.73]Don't want to do it.
[82:13.87]Don't make me do it.
[82:14.77]Don't make me do it.
[82:15.75]Don't make me do it.
[82:16.93]Was that the reason that guy came here for the first time to ask me that?
[82:19.41]Was to try to bait me into reading it so that you would do the John Oliver?
[82:22.15]I'm not going to do it.
[82:26.28]No, I can't.
[82:27.50]No.
[82:27.68]What about like John Oliver doing like a what's up doc?
[82:34.68]All right, gamers.
[82:36.46]I thought that was it.
[82:37.66]I was like, wait a minute.
[82:40.64]It's your time.
[82:41.65]It's your time.
[82:42.01]You want to go?
[82:42.87]Let's go.
[82:43.19]Let's go.
[82:43.57]Who are we going against?
[82:45.43]Stans and Alpharad.
[82:47.01]All right.
[82:47.35]Okay.
[82:48.95]All right.
[82:49.29]So go ahead and set that one up.
[82:50.77]You can start that up whenever it's ready.
[82:52.47]Cool.
[82:54.27]Okay.
[82:55.37]I will add them.
[82:58.55]These guys are pretty good at gaming.
[83:00.11]They are?
[83:00.39]So are we.
[83:01.03]We'll be fine.
[83:02.77]We're better at gaming sometimes.
[83:05.82]Hey, so are we.
[83:08.32]This could be our day.
[83:09.00]I'm not playing Rhindog, guys.
[83:14.12]I'm not doing that.
[83:18.60]Unless I lose.
[83:19.46]If I lose the first round, I'll play Rhindog.
[83:22.96]Yeah, we'll switch it up if we lose.
[83:25.70]Okay.
[83:30.44]What is... There we go.
[83:35.29]Okay.
[83:39.14]ryan dog be like french fry yeah he does be like that that's what he does all right I've sent them both invites
[84:06.79]Change profile pic so you don't get caught using the Steven Universe one.
[84:09.35]Thank you for reminding me.
[84:10.99]Oh, oh, shit.
[84:19.93]They're in a game?
[84:21.95]Oh.
[84:22.54]They're in a game?
[84:24.40]See, we just talked about, like, playing Pokemon.
[84:28.00]We didn't practice.
[84:28.82]Oh, we could have been practicing this whole time.
[84:31.96]We could have.
[84:32.82]Wow, it's been like 20 minutes too, hasn't it?
[84:35.95]Yep.
[84:36.41]Oh, well, whatever.
[84:37.11]I think we're okay.
[84:40.83]Did you at least, like, eat more carrots?
[84:43.21]I'm on it.
[84:44.61]Here we go.
[84:49.59]The carrots are wearing off.
[84:50.51]Nope.
[84:50.83]I'm gonna make sure there's a stream of carrots.
[85:04.09]Wait, Conor, is your birthday?
[85:05.59]Is it actually your birthday?
[85:07.12]No, it's not.
[85:07.76]My birthday is like, uh, not this Friday.
[85:10.84]Well, two weeks from Friday.
[85:14.24]Well, happy birthday.
[85:15.08]Happy early birthday.
[85:15.70]Thanks.
[85:16.16]It's my birthday.
[85:16.86]Here we go.
[85:20.63]All right.
[85:21.15]All right, let's do a repeat of last time.
[85:27.53]Oh, this guy's got a cool profile picture.
[85:29.64]Okay.
[85:36.02]Oh, he's the Looney King.
[85:40.01]Jerma, do you have that one?
[85:41.37]What's the Looney King?
[85:43.15]It's the profile picture Alpharad has.
[85:44.95]I think he gets that from being like... Really good?
[85:48.33]At Bugs Bunny, I think.
[85:49.61]What?
[85:52.23]Reached mastery level 14 on Bugs Bunny.
[85:54.66]What?
[85:56.26]Are you not mastery level?
[85:57.70]No.
[85:58.80]Oh, no.
[85:59.44]I always get to like right before mastery and change character.
[86:04.09]Because I don't want anyone, I don't need that to be good.
[86:07.11]Right.
[86:08.93]So we can go whenever, right?
[86:10.43]I get really, like, self-conscious about, like, if people can tell that, like, I've played the game a good bit in an online game so that I can always have the excuse of, like, oh, well, like, I, I don't even play that much.
[86:20.17]Like, get a life, go outside, and then, like, I leave the game.
[86:22.87]That's what I do in, like, Valorant.
[86:26.73]Like, Overwatch.
[86:29.21]Let me just make sure.
[86:30.25]Should I go right when we're ready, or?
[86:33.05]We're waiting for the go-ahead.
[86:35.77]I'm assuming we can start, but I could be wrong.
[86:42.45]Change character?
[86:45.06]You could try Superman if you want.
[86:46.68]I could try Superman.
[86:49.20]That's a good call.
[86:49.72]I'm going to go Superman.
[86:52.10]Change it up.
[86:54.82]I don't think I can have perks on Superman, though.
[87:02.50]Oh, well.
[87:07.19]As long as I'm standing, you can count on me.
[87:09.76]Oh, shit.
[87:10.66]Hold on.
[87:10.96]Uh-oh.
[87:16.24]No, wait.
[87:16.94]Hey.
[87:17.08]It's all right.
[87:17.68]It's all right.
[87:18.10]It's all right.
[87:18.50]You get time here to do it.
[87:23.90]Cooldown duration?
[87:24.47]What do you think?
[87:24.89]What are you playing as?
[87:26.19]Commentary.
[87:26.47]Yeah, yeah, yeahberger.
[87:27.59]You can do cooldown if you want.
[87:28.67]Cooldown.
[87:35.75]5% melee damage.
[87:37.33]Oh, hell not.
[87:39.07]How are you guys feeling going into this?
[87:41.34]I feel pretty good.
[87:42.70]I mean, I don't have a perk, which is, you know, should be illegal.
[87:50.69]I would never do that.
[87:51.43]Hey, watch this.
[87:52.11]We're good.
[87:56.77]Stacking perks is like a sign that like you're afraid, I think.
[88:00.44]There we go.
[88:02.70]You ready?
[88:03.00]Let's go.
[88:03.60]Yep.
[88:03.94]I got beta carotene flowing through my bloodstream.
[88:35.68]Shit.
[88:43.72]Oh my god.
[88:45.66]The top of my control stick fell off.
[88:48.62]Oh man.
[88:50.92]Okay.
[88:52.46]Sorry.
[88:53.02]Literally, Jerma, like the top of the Xbox controller thumbstick fell off.
[88:57.64]You got a control problem?
[88:59.20]It fell off of the controller.
[89:02.24]There's no stick.
[89:22.43]We got to get rid of this fucking Superman.
[89:24.65]I know I'm trying.
[89:32.24]There you go.
[89:35.40]What?
[89:37.60]Oh, you're being arrested.
[89:39.50]Oh, my goodness gracious.
[89:42.97]Wow, that one took me by surprise.
[89:50.08]We're good.
[89:50.34]We're good.
[89:50.56]We're good.
[89:50.82]It's all right.
[89:51.28]Hold together.
[89:52.94]Speed up on this Superman.
[89:53.69]They're going to be hitting gamer fatigue really soon here.
[89:56.03]Yep.
[89:56.89]They're too confident.
[90:01.84]That's not what I meant to do.
[90:05.16]Oh, I had it.
[90:38.85]There it is.
[90:39.11]We're good, good, good, good, good.
[90:40.07]Velma, Velma, Velma.
[91:08.86]No, I tried the spiker.
[91:10.76]Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[91:12.52]We almost brought it back.
[91:13.68]We almost brought it back.
[91:15.44]Man, listen, if we had host, that spike hits.
[91:18.04]Sorry, we had it.
[91:18.74]That was a good game, good game.
[91:19.74]Very close, very close.
[91:22.60]Very close.
[91:23.22]Look at that.
[91:24.12]468 damage.
[91:25.16]It shouldn't even be illegal.
[91:27.48]Oh, my God.
[91:28.60]A 3d2.
[91:33.16]Alright, alright, alright.
[91:34.00]Here's the plan.
[91:37.12]Ready?
[91:38.16]I'm going back to bugs.
[91:39.66]Okay.
[91:43.86]No, I think I stay on Tom and Jerry chat.
[91:45.44]I know you guys want Rindog, but I don't think I'm going to win with Rindog.
[91:48.67]I don't know how to play that guy.
[91:49.61]I should have ran out of carrots.
[91:51.91]This is the part you don't eat.
[91:54.79]Oh, no.
[91:55.51]You have to eat it.
[91:56.01]You have to eat it.
[91:57.21]No, it's the part you can't even eat.
[91:58.93]You have to eat it.
[91:59.87]Okay, fine.
[92:03.70]Hold on.
[92:05.98]Wait.
[92:06.56]Let me just do my level up spell.
[92:11.16]What the?
[92:11.82]What?
[92:14.88]Whoa.
[92:17.88]All right, let's go.
[92:24.78]Show them what we got.
[92:26.84]We can pull it back here.
[92:28.24]We're going to win.
[92:31.89]I know you can eat that part.
[92:32.73]I'm kidding.
[92:37.34]Hey, Connor, even if we lose, you still want to play multiverse really well?
[92:42.29]Yeah, I'm down.
[92:42.71]We're going to win this one right here.
[93:35.67]Get out of there, get out of that thing!
[93:44.04]Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up.
[93:45.12]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[93:54.20]Not what I did.
[94:01.14]Shit, I tried to do...
[94:05.26]You'll regret that.
[94:38.00]We need a spike here.
[94:39.50]Yep.
[94:39.84]Ah, fuck that car!
[95:10.99]How did that not hit him?
[95:22.04]He's just baiting us.
[95:22.70]He's baiting us.
[95:23.12]We gotta hit Velma.
[95:25.47]There it is.
[95:25.77]Alright, go, go, go, go, Velma.
[95:29.57]Let's try it.
[95:50.47]God, how do they keep dodging me?
[95:51.57]No, no, no, we got him.
[95:52.89]Oh, sorry, sorry.
[95:54.86]I don't understand.
[95:55.90]Damn it.
[95:56.56]Ah, I missed the spike.
[95:57.30]If I didn't miss the spike, we would've won.
[95:59.16]Ah, fuck.
[95:59.68]I missed the spike.
[96:02.14]Man, I just don't understand.
[96:03.56]Things that usually work weren't working.
[96:05.96]You guys were doing great.
[96:06.97]Honestly, their strat of having Velma in the back, Superman in the front was pretty hard to deal with and I think you guys adapted pretty well.
[96:14.09]They were saying that we're the most honest team in the tournament, is what people have been saying, actually.
[96:18.44]Is that Tom and Jerry and Bugs is potentially, like, the most ethical, like... The most ethical.
[96:23.86]Ethically and morally, I think you guys are in the lead.
[96:27.46]I have mixed feelings about Batman deciding to kill in this game after, like, signing a lifelong vow.
[96:33.87]So, yeah, I think you guys are spot on.
[96:36.23]That's true.
[96:37.45]That was a good match.
[96:38.21]We almost had it.
[96:39.73]Well, you guys, free to go.

[98:45.67]Yes.
[98:46.49]Hey, guys.
[98:46.77]My younger sister loves you guys.
[98:48.81]I know, probably.
[98:50.55]I'll invite you to the lobby.
[98:52.63]She was wondering when you're going to start posting Minecraft YouTube videos, though.
[98:56.91]Tell her that... Tell her Conrad's pants has got... He retired.
[99:00.17]He's a new guy now.
[99:02.39]They recasted him.
[99:03.29]He's different now.
[99:05.67]Who's playing him now?
[99:07.56]Jared Leto, I think.
[99:09.20]That's crazy.
[99:10.16]No, hopefully not.
[99:11.14]I didn't approve of that.
[99:12.94]Well, you don't have to approve of them, really.
[99:15.86]You don't like Jared Leto?
[99:17.66]No.
[99:20.18]Andy Kerr.
[99:20.84]Someone's really upset that... Yeah, that's all I have.
[99:24.03]I'm just like, oh, remember the guy that was at the multiverse tournament that ate carrots?
[99:27.77]Like, that was what was funny?
[99:30.28]Oh, there's like fucking like 100,000 people probably concurrently watching the stream.
[99:33.90]I'm the funny guy that chews the carrot.
[99:35.38]Yeah.
[99:36.96]Like, that's all I have right now.
[99:38.22]It's literally the only thing I have today.
[99:42.10]I'll just run it random.
[99:43.42]Cool.
[99:44.42]This is for all the glory.
[99:46.76]This is for all the fourth place.
[99:48.20]This is to get the one point in Mario Kart.
[99:50.72]I said that I would gift fourth place each of them a sub to Amaranth.
[99:55.55]Okay.
[99:56.51]Okay.
[99:57.40]I'm already subbed.
[99:58.82]I didn't.
[100:01.59]You say you're already subbed, Connor?
[100:02.79]Oh, yeah.
[100:03.05]No, I'm like on a 14-month streak, I think.
[100:05.35]It's tier three, right?
[100:06.97]No, no.
[100:07.47]I don't have it like that.
[100:08.83]Ready to go?
[100:09.43]Oh.
[100:10.05]I'll tell you what.
[100:10.53]I'll tier three then.
[100:11.93]We'll do that.
[100:13.61]All right.
[100:14.19]Okay.
[100:17.24]Good luck, guys.
[100:18.52]Good luck, guys.
[100:20.78]All right.
[100:22.18]I think we stayed what we got.
[100:24.18]Yep.
[100:27.65]Oh, they want me to play Rhindog.
[100:29.13]I'm not doing that.
[100:30.81]Maybe next time.
[100:31.49]Are you guys going for fifth?
[100:33.81]No, this is fourth.
[100:39.12]All I want is the one point in fourth place in Mario Kart.
[100:41.46]That's all I care about.
[100:42.08]Do you need another carrot?
[100:45.06]Yeah.
[100:45.98]Good.
[100:47.04]Because then we placed, right?
[100:50.13]If you come in fourth place, you place.
[100:52.51]Well, do we win something?
[100:55.39]Because I don't think so.
[100:56.74]no no but like we do place fourth which is like right below like top three yeah I'm okay with that yeah it's for fifth not fourth oh okay well top five these guys don't even have any perks show them what we got
[101:20.02]Well, let's get that fourth place.
[101:23.48]Yep.
[101:24.26]Put on your chapstick.
[101:25.76]How did the top come off the controller?
[101:27.34]I have the Xbox Elite controller, so you can switch out the thumbsticks.
[101:31.71]And then I was gaming so hard that the left one popped off, and it was just a little nub.
[101:35.55]Let's go for it.
[102:08.32]All right, get that.
[102:09.72]Oh, nice attempt.
[102:13.90]They almost had it.
[102:15.22]Yep.
[102:16.20]It cost them, though.
[102:23.03]Other items.
[102:25.43]Where the hell did this come from?
[102:28.27]Oh, that's you, right?
[102:28.95]You can pull out an item.
[102:29.85]Yep.
[102:34.10]Get ready for a speeding kickin'.
[102:37.85]Oh, I got him.
[102:39.11]I got him early, too.
[102:41.15]Okay.
[102:42.15]That one's done.
[102:45.75]Oh, I could have gone for the counter.
[102:52.47]There it is.
[102:53.45]Dude, you are on point this game.
[102:55.21]Yep.
[102:57.51]This is what's serious.
[103:00.34]We have ourselves a rabbit, Hayden.
[103:04.86]Time to scoot a boot.
[103:36.89]There it is.
[103:37.37]Nice stuff.
[103:37.69]There we go.
[103:38.35]Dude, you were on point that game.
[103:39.83]Oof, I was gaming.
[103:42.17]I probably did like 30 damage that game.
[103:44.43]You probably did like 500.
[103:46.62]You hard carried that game.
[103:47.54]This place matters.
[103:51.50]Four KOs, damn.
[103:55.50]Nice game.
[103:56.74]It was good.
[103:57.08]Alright, I'll play Reindog now, guys.
[104:01.43]We gotta solidify the win.
[104:04.40]You don't want me to play Reindog?
[104:06.16]You can play Reindog when we're just goofing around after this.
[104:08.36]Oh, okay, okay, that's fair.
[104:09.13]That's fair.
[104:09.75]See, I agree.
[104:10.87]They were just... Some people were really... There was like two Reindog fans that were really losing it.
[104:18.03]He's literally like an original character.
[104:19.76]Somebody just said, suck my ass.
[104:22.82]Time that person off for like 35 seconds.
[104:25.00]That's probably one of mine.
[104:31.84]It's probably one of mine.
[104:33.04]Yeah, that sounds like something one of my guys would say.
[104:40.99]35 seconds or 35 years?
[104:43.29]Somewhere in between.
[104:43.87]Let's take the average.
[104:45.43]Alright, we solidify fourth place.
[104:49.76]I'm happy with fourth place if we get it.
[104:57.50]It's like a reindeer dog.
[105:00.22]I just now realized that.
[105:03.05]I'm trying to get the early knockout.
[105:52.13]Dead spike.
[105:53.99]There it is.
[105:54.43]Oh, what?
[105:54.99]Guess not.
[105:55.31]Almost, almost got it.
[106:14.50]There it is.
[106:15.10]Nice job.
[106:15.38]All right, get it.
[106:16.00]Double it up.
[106:27.20]There it is.
[106:28.48]Nice job.
[106:29.10]Okay.
[106:30.37]We've done it again.
[106:31.09]That was a good fight.
[106:33.59]That was good.
[106:34.27]We did it.
[106:35.41]Fifth place.
[106:38.19]No, this was fourth.
[106:38.97]Oh.
[106:39.51]They kept saying it was for fifth.
[106:42.53]Yeah, no, I just wanted to... Yeah, we just wanted to goof.
[106:46.78]Gift you a sub to Amaranth, really.
[106:48.04]I'm just...
[106:49.55]Thank you.
[106:49.89]Good games, good games.
[106:50.53]I appreciate it.
[106:51.31]Trying to fund you guys.
[106:53.43]Let me just get those going real quick.
[106:55.51]Let me just exit out of multiverse.
[106:56.95]This is a bad game.
[106:57.79]You know what I mean?
[106:59.08]That's a great game.
[107:00.30]No, it's a bad game.
[107:01.26]I think it's phenomenal.
[107:02.16]It's a fantastic video game.
[107:04.14]It is.
[107:04.42]All right.
[107:05.40]It's truly great.
[107:07.08]Jeremy, what are you eating?
[107:09.66]Ham sandwich.
[107:11.58]Any cheese?
[107:12.86]No, no cheese.
[107:13.66]Just mustard.
[107:15.07]just mustard and ham I like it mustard ham and and two man of class one piece of one piece of whole wheat bread you don't even have two it's just like it's almost like a hot dog you get to your bread lasts a lot longer that way I mean I guess that's true is it a wrap then almost you could fold it and eat it like a sliced pizza
[107:35.55]Interesting that you went with pizza on the folded one.
[107:38.30]And it's ham and mustard.
[107:40.90]Ham, mustard, one piece of whole wheat.
[107:43.94]Fold it up like a piece of pizza.
[107:45.62]Take a bite.
[107:47.54]You're golden.
[107:49.75]Here's your tier... I can't give a tier 3 to you?
[107:53.93]Open face liar.
[107:54.99]Told you, I'm already a son.
[107:57.69]Wait, you're lying?
[107:59.22]No, dude, I just gifted Connor eats pant.
[108:03.34]No, no, no, no.
[108:04.18]Fuck.
[108:06.34]Oh, that is a $25 down the drain there.
[108:12.68]Oh, no.
[108:15.28]Okay.
[108:16.60]That is too bad.
[108:20.30]You're not a sub you piece of shit.
[108:22.08]So I just
[108:24.55]Whoa.
[108:25.27]Is this edible?
[108:26.72]Are you taking an edible?
[108:29.24]What?
[108:29.88]No, I said, is this edible?
[108:32.92]The tier three sub?
[108:35.00]No, no.
[108:35.52]This piece of this carrot.
[108:37.62]This is not even a carrot.
[108:38.58]This is like fucking spinach.
[108:42.32]Oh, it was for the aesthetic.
[108:44.16]That's what it was.
[108:45.46]Jerma, would you both go to... Let me just make sure I don't type in the wrong one.
[108:52.28]Jerma985.
[108:52.86]Great.
[108:54.69]Would you guys do me a favor and go to her stream to validate that I have, in fact, given you tier three emotes?
[108:59.97]I'll find out.
[109:01.53]Why can't I gift you a sub, Jerma?
[109:03.57]I don't know.
[109:06.65]Can you gift me one?
[109:07.57]I might have already been gifted this, like, for years.
[109:10.29]Okay, is there another streamer that you would like a gifted sub to?
[109:13.36]Conrad Spence.
[109:16.92]Oh, my God.
[109:19.00]Incredible choice.
[109:21.24]Oh, my God.

[109:48.78]I thought we were doing tier one.
[109:50.33]No, tier threes.
[109:52.15]I think there's an image of just some guy's face for tier three, too.

[111:33.57]Maybe so.
[111:37.12]There we go.
[111:37.56]I had to verify that was the real Scarlet Otter.
[111:42.38]Yeah, we got fourth place.
[111:44.97]I'm okay with that.
[111:48.33]solidify that fourth place is fine like maybe like in the next one we like get third hey that's not right like once they add like johnny bravo to the game it's like wait how is it fifth place is it really fifth no I'll say that how many teams were there I thought there was six teams
[112:19.93]You tied for fifth.
[112:21.89]Four and a half place.
[112:24.54]Fourth loses to third.
[112:27.24]The tie was between fifth and sixth.
[112:29.10]Oh, there were eight teams.
[112:30.50]Oh.
[112:32.14]So now, wouldn't we be tied for fourth?
[112:37.39]I won't let you down.
[112:41.60]Four and a half.
[112:42.66]We're four and a half.
[112:43.80]Oh.
[112:44.10]Well, whatever.
[112:44.60]That's right in the middle.
[112:45.94]Why is this streamer so awkward?
[112:47.40]That's just how I am, dude.
[112:48.62]That's just like... Who said that?
[112:50.44]Did they say that in my channel?
[112:52.36]No.
[112:53.00]Better not have... Buy the Rhine Dog skin.
[113:00.71]No.
[113:02.07]We didn't even win the tournament, guys.
[113:03.39]I don't have enough to buy the Rhine Dog skin.
[113:07.25]Oh, these guys have the buff...
[113:11.65]have what oh yeah wait is that actually a thing no because I kept committing too and I was like wait maybe he's serious because we're getting kind of screwed up on this stage no velma's just really good velma's really good bugs is really good too if you know what you're doing with velma you are terrifying
[113:41.95]Whoa, wait, I don't know what that does.
[113:43.19]That was kind of crazy.
[113:48.84]I'm just pressing button.
[113:55.76]And maybe I'm a Rhino guy.
[113:57.94]You might be.
[114:11.03]whoa how did he just didn't go off the screen that was weird well he's dead why would I hit him up ryan dog is awesome you like ryan dog he's awesome he's a little dog I don't know what noise does ryan dog make he's a reindeer dog
[114:39.82]Yeah, I don't know.
[114:40.28]It's a rain dog.
[114:41.46]Oh, that makes a lot more sense.
[114:42.48]You got all four KOs.
[114:44.82]Man.
[114:45.34]Yeah.
[114:46.06]The rain dog thing.
[114:48.52]The person just said, I need... Wait, I need to eat?
[114:50.40]Did they just write that?
[114:53.01]What?
[114:53.65]This person just said, I gotta go.
[114:54.91]I have to eat.
[114:56.19]I have to eat dinner or something.
[114:58.29]Are they not allowed to go eat?
[115:00.15]Was that like an emote?
[115:03.84]It had an emote that said, what are you talking about?
[115:05.76]Jake just said, hey, I gotta go.
[115:07.86]I gotta eat.
[115:09.30]Oh, okay.
[115:10.00]I see.
[115:10.34]I thought you were saying somebody in your chat said an emote that said, I gotta go eat.
[115:13.72]I was like, what are you talking about?
[115:15.30]It takes up the whole thing to chat.
[115:17.08]I was like, yeah, it's kind of a weird emote.
[115:18.80]Hey, I gotta go.
[115:19.83]I've got to go eat.
[115:20.77]It's like a 50-part emote.
[115:23.23]Here comes the heat.
[115:26.09]Just if you leave the game, they have some dialogue sometimes.
[115:29.19]Right choice.
[115:30.45]Only choice.
[115:35.65]Wait, oops, I forgot to... I didn't pick Raindog.
[115:42.61]That's so surreal.
[115:48.68]Make sure you're filling up your, um... Wait, get this off.
[115:56.05]What's wrong?
[115:56.55]I'll put the Burger King guy on.
[116:10.25]I think I'm going to try this game.
[116:11.29]You actually should.
[116:12.11]The game's fantastic.
[116:19.02]Genuinely speaking, the game's very good.
[116:24.22]It's really fun.
[116:27.20]No, we're not sponsored today, guys.
[116:28.58]Sorry.
[116:28.96]That's not what this is.
[116:29.94]This is not sponsored.
[116:31.78]We just planned.
[116:33.46]I liked the game before I was sponsored.
[116:35.33]You know what?
[116:36.05]Me too.
[116:37.33]I played it back when it was first in that little alpha they did, whatever it was.
[116:41.65]Don't you come talking smack to me.
[116:52.74]That basketball just like ruined everything he was doing.
[116:56.22]You went Daffy in this game, right?
[116:57.99]Oh, so bad.
[116:58.69]That'd be cool.
[117:03.55]Be cool if he had like Duck Dodgers moves too.
[117:11.14]Missed that one.
[117:12.30]My bad.
[117:18.16]What the fuck?
[117:25.15]Oh my goodness.
[117:38.61]What's your favorite Looney Tunes episode?
[117:42.21]Um... It's Tiny Toons and It's How I Spent My Summer Vacation.
[117:51.36]Different franchise.
[117:52.84]Oh, I used to love Tiny Toons.
[117:57.21]They were like different... They weren't even like... It wasn't bugs.
[118:01.07]It was like different rabbits.
[118:03.65]Yeah, they were like...
[118:06.27]Uh, it was how I spent my summer vacation in Happy World Land.
[118:08.96]It was the plucky and, um... Forky the pig's son, whatever who... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[118:17.77]I know what you're talking about.
[118:19.91]I like, for Looney Tunes, I like the one where, like, bugs, like, ghost, like, different... Forgive me what it was.
[118:26.88]Like, different animation, almost, it looks like.
[118:28.66]It's like trap, and then... No, is it Daffy that does it?
[118:31.62]At the end, he's like... I can't even remember how to recall it.
[118:34.88]Someone knows what I'm talking about.
[118:37.17]Daffy gets, like, stuck in, like, some realm.
[118:39.53]Oh, my God, it's just... Sorry.
[118:42.81]Sorry if I startled you.
[118:44.27]No, you're fine.
[118:44.87]Like a chomper.
[118:48.87]Duck or mug?
[118:49.59]Maybe so.
[118:50.49]I don't know the name.
[118:51.07]How am I still here?
[118:58.96]There we go.
[119:04.43]Oh, I missed it.
[119:15.71]I still can't believe LeBron James is in this game.
[119:18.47]It's crazy.
[119:20.11]Who do you think is the next real person they'll add besides John Oliver so they don't have to do it?
[119:30.38]Um... Okay, the next real person?
[119:32.30]Uh, Gandalf.
[119:36.57]Gandalf?
[119:37.57]Yeah, nah, that makes sense.
[119:39.17]I mean, Gandalf is a... The depiction of Gandalf they're gonna use in this is like a real guy.
[119:45.23]They're just going to use Ian McKellen.
[119:46.65]Yeah.
[119:48.92]It's just Ian.
[119:49.62]You know, I wouldn't be surprised if like they can't get the rights to like Gandalf and Tolkien estate.
[119:54.06]So they just put in Ian McKellen and he has like some like wizard moves here and there.
[119:58.87]Gandalf would be awesome.
[120:02.43]Shaggy's not a real guy.
[120:03.63]He's a cartoon character.
[120:04.89]He's not a real person.
[120:06.17]Well, actually, no, he is in the movies.
[120:12.11]kind of wish they just had like shaggy that isn't like the meme shaggy like a shaggy that's fighting with scooby or something there's no way scooby-doo is not in the game yeah that's crazy to me but I would have liked like shaggy and scooby as like a duo team rather than like oh he's like he's like doing the meme like
[120:42.54]Sing Tiny Toons?
[120:45.48]See if I can remember it.
[120:50.46]We're tiny, we're toony, we're all a little loony.
[120:53.33]Oh my god.
[120:54.03]And in this cartoony, we're invading your TV.
[121:00.55]Fuck.
[121:01.05]Hold on, I lost it.
[121:01.65]I couldn't remember it, and then you immediately brought it back to me.
[121:04.41]We're tiny, we're toony, we're all a little loony.
[121:07.13]And in this cartoony, we're invading your TV.
[121:12.16]They crack up all the senses.
[121:15.82]Sensors.
[121:17.26]And Tiny Toon Adventures in a dose of harmony.
[121:20.64]When in Acme Acres it's a whole wide world apart.
[121:25.58]It sets alone a maid of stone and cartoon worker of art.
[121:30.30]Expect the expected.
[121:32.12]Expect the unexpected.
[121:33.81]With Tiny Toon Adventures it's about to start.
[121:37.81]I don't know.
[121:38.75]Something like that.
[121:41.57]Oh, we're doing double?
[121:42.23]Yeah, I just realized what we were doing.
[121:43.35]One thing I like doing with LeBron is you just bounce one of the balls down and then you steal another so that just stays out there as like a thing that they keep bouncing into.
[121:57.29]This is hell here, by the way.
[121:58.27]Especially having to deal with this here.
[122:18.39]What?
[122:20.31]What?
[122:24.53]How did I live?
[122:27.72]Oh, my goodness.
[122:28.30]This dude.
[122:31.00]That's got to be.
[122:34.28]Wow.
[122:36.28]We.
[122:45.20]Whoa.
[122:45.50]We.
[122:45.94]That was weird.
[122:52.07]I think LeBron even like knows he's in this game.
[122:54.09]Or like when he signed the Space Jam contract, it was like this was in here somehow.
[122:58.36]He didn't know this was here.
[122:59.56]And he didn't know.
[123:00.58]That's wicked funny.
[123:15.46]Oh, he's just begging to be knocked over there.
[123:17.50]Okay, we're good.
[123:19.28]I told you we got this.
[123:24.08]Imagine, like, his son's, like, playing this game with his friends.
[123:26.50]He walks in the room.
[123:27.00]He's like, is that me?
[123:27.60]He's like, yeah, like, you're in the game.
[123:29.44]Do you think he's just like, all right, whatever.
[123:32.92]Probably.
[123:33.98]He has this voice.
[123:34.69]He's like, is that me?
[123:37.29]I can't tell.
[123:38.37]Is it me talking?
[123:40.43]I don't remember recording this.
[123:47.09]Please change Omega L2.
[123:48.43]Wowee.
[123:51.31]It's not his voice.
[123:54.47]Wait, it's an actor.
[123:56.40]Yeah, it's not LeBron that voices him.
[123:59.74]So there's a very real possibility that he does not know he's in this game.
[124:02.50]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[124:03.52]You're right.
[124:04.24]Wow, okay.
[124:05.92]Did you see Space Jam 2?
[124:07.88]No.
[124:08.62]It was probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.
[124:12.07]It was really that bad?
[124:13.59]I saw that movie, and I enjoyed the first Space Jam as a kid.
[124:15.97]I know it's not great looking.
[124:17.79]I was like, okay, it's fine.
[124:18.91]Fun movie.
[124:20.03]This one is just so unapologetically awful.
[124:22.39]It hurt me.
[124:23.57]Like, I was in the theater.
[124:25.26]I'm like, wow, this is upsetting.
[124:26.62]Like, I actually want my money back.
[124:28.56]What was wrong with it?
[124:30.08]it was just none of the jokes were good the looney tunes weren't even like the looney they didn't do any looney tunes like funny bits they were just kind of like character archetypes that weren't the looney tunes really weird yeah it was very weird and then like lebron is like his performance is awful I hate to say it but he doesn't know how to like you know do that he doesn't know how to talk the looney tunes
[124:55.28]and then also like e3 was like a major like plot point of the film it didn't make any sense hold on wait wait wait e3 e3 yeah so lebron's son is like dad I want to go to e3 camp and then lebron's like you can't go to e3 camp and then he's like no but dad I want to and then the movie is spoilers it ends the kid goes to e3 camp oh all right the whole time I'm watching I'm like e3 is not a camp
[125:23.09]E3 camp.
[125:24.83]But it's literally the logo for E3.
[125:26.62]Like they had the rights.
[125:27.62]I don't know where it came from.
[125:28.66]I'm like, it's not a camp.
[125:31.02]That's so that's strange.
[125:32.10]That's odd.
[125:41.65]And then it's like they're all in a video game.
[125:43.91]It's like the idea.
[125:44.68]They're like, oh, LeBron, you got sucked into the video game.
[125:48.30]But then the video game is just like Don Cheadle's AI imagination.
[125:53.48]I feel like you're just making stuff up.
[125:56.46]I'm literally not.
[125:57.22]I mean, you can ask Chad.
[125:58.46]I'm telling the truth.
[125:59.98]And then, but like, it's like the metaverse, I think is the idea.
[126:05.23]But it's the metaverse if it was only Warner Bros.
[126:07.77]characters that they own.
[126:09.01]You're through.
[126:10.53]Um, and so they jump, like the entire first 40 minutes of the movie is them just jumping between different properties that like, oh it's just Bugs Bunny and LeBron.
[126:18.93]Like, they're like, oh we're in Game of Thrones, what?
[126:20.96]And it's like, what?
[126:21.82]DC?
[126:22.52]Where's Batman?
[126:23.26]And it's just like, remember all these things?
[126:25.88]That's so weird.
[126:27.72]I'm like, wait, where's like Daffy Duck, like where is everybody?
[126:38.34]So wait, how many minutes is Daffy Duck in the movie for?
[126:42.34]He might have like three lines.
[126:44.14]What?
[126:44.78]Oh, I'm not even kidding.
[126:46.58]You gotta be shitting me.
[126:54.77]Oh my god!
[126:55.73]I just got stuffed.
[126:57.03]I got stuffed on.
[127:02.41]I sort of went way quicker than that.
[127:04.31]That was dumb.
[127:12.32]more LeBron earlier and I forgot I'm good with him.
[127:20.92]There it goes.
[127:21.38]I thought they were going to drop down more.
[127:27.96]We're good.
[127:35.14]I get to watch it and give it.
[127:36.04]Should I?
[127:36.36]OK, should I watch the new movie?
[127:40.02]I'd like to hear what you thought you want to give you like a full review after I see it yeah I would like to hear it I mean I also like don't want to wish that on you I feel like you'd be really upset but should I okay should I be interested all right how about this should I I will watch the movie and I will write you like a three or four paragraph professional review of the movie okay and you will you will read it on your stream okay I'm done you don't do that okay yeah totally
[128:08.15]Just give me like back in action.
[128:09.45]I love that movie as a kid.
[128:10.59]I don't think it's very good looking back, but I used to love that.
[128:13.20]Just give me six months.
[128:14.68]Okay.
[128:16.40]I mean, you got to make sure it's like proofread and those paragraphs are good.
[128:22.10]Live tweet your reaction.
[128:23.46]It'd be great if like one of your like five, like four to five of your tweets in the year are just like throughout Space Jam 2.
[128:33.55]I actually think that's kind of funny.
[128:37.58]half of my tweets for the whole year or more are a live I'll lose thousands of followers but do I really care if I tweet that much in one day people are going to remember that they followed me like eight years ago because they'll see me right because they never do because I'm only in people's feeds like once every like three or four months so they will they will see it during the day and be like oh shit I follow this guy this guy sucks and unfollow me
[129:03.95]They're like, wait, who is this guy?
[129:04.99]They click the link in your bio.
[129:05.83]They're like, yeah, he hasn't uploaded in like eight years.
[129:07.89]Yeah.
[129:09.08]Yeah.
[129:09.62]That's worth it.
[129:10.22]Whatever.
[129:17.54]Shut up, you asshole.
[129:18.54]All your tweets get a lot of likes.
[129:24.49]No, they don't.
[129:25.09]Do they?
[129:25.35]Let me check.
[129:32.13]All right, Connor, go read.
[129:33.67]Go read out loud the last five tweets.
[129:37.87]That's not the going live one, so you have... No, not the going live one.
[129:41.65]We have, I spent the last 20 minutes going line by line translating this old note I had on my iPhone.
[129:46.67]It was from a year ago.
[129:47.75]Freaking out trying to decipher its meaning.
[129:49.78]Was I hacked?
[129:50.54]Did I do this in my sleep?
[129:52.16]Demon shit?
[129:53.36]No.
[129:53.80]It's just the default pages template with lorem ipsum.
[129:57.88]I got 60k likes.
[129:59.85]What?
[130:00.33]It did?
[130:01.01]Why?
[130:01.41]I don't know.
[130:02.73]Apparently it hit.
[130:07.02]Even your hashtag ad tweet got skincare.
[130:09.04]People are excited to see a tweet.
[130:13.46]We have everybody twerked and everybody gave a drug PSA.
[130:17.27]Good luck.
[130:18.43]Okay.
[130:19.03]That's for the green screen footage.
[130:25.91]You're probably going to go back a year, by the way.
[130:28.07]Yeah, I'm looking through trying to see what isn't an announcement.
[130:34.93]Did they nerf Taz again, or is he still amazing?
[130:37.57]I think they nerfed him pretty hard.
[130:38.77]People were complaining.
[130:41.07]What happened there?
[130:42.17]That was kind of a mess.
[130:43.01]I don't know, honestly.
[130:43.95]I just couldn't get back.
[130:44.78]I guess I ran out of specials.
[130:48.54]Oh, nice try.
[130:49.82]Nice try.
[130:50.34]Whatever.
[131:03.94]What's the worst movie you've ever seen, like, currently, before seeing Spice Jam?
[131:09.62]Stop doing that!
[131:10.26]Stop doing that!
[131:10.80]Stop doing that to me!
[131:12.68]Okay, we're good.
[131:13.14]He stopped.
[131:16.00]Oh my goodness gracious, we got fucking diarrheaed on.
[131:22.80]What is that guy's username?
[131:26.42]BreedableBully44?
[131:27.63]What the fuck?
[131:32.33]Okay, well.
[131:36.36]And then that guy's name is Focus on Deez.
[131:39.44]We can't lose to these guys.
[131:40.78]We just did.
[131:41.50]Bad.
[131:41.90]We can't lose to them.
[131:44.06]We just did very... All right.
[131:45.89]All right.
[131:46.09]We're going.
[131:46.59]I got an idea.
[131:51.51]I knew I should have taken that turn at Albuquerque.
[131:59.52]I knew I should have taken that turn at Albuquerque.
[132:08.53]Double Rhindog wins this matchup.
[132:18.12]Level 21?
[132:22.69]It's not fair.
[132:23.29]They should delete your account when you get to level 20 on any character.
[132:28.69]yeah like you gotta play something else it's a free to play game come on now let people have a chance now this is one for the ages no did you uh have a least favorite movie um it's been a while since I've seen a movie that I genuinely really hated yeah I didn't have a least favorite until I saw that honestly that's become that's become least favorite ever it upset me well because like even as like a kid right I'd be like oh maybe they'll make a new space jam movie
[132:58.89]Like, oh, it'll come out one day.
[133:00.33]And then it finally happened.
[133:01.39]And then it was like... And you just hated it.
[133:04.11]It was just everything I hated about what it possibly could have been.
[133:15.82]Oh, how did that not hit?
[133:22.65]What?
[133:22.93]Excuse me?
[133:23.97]What the fuck just happened?
[133:27.16]Got him.
[133:27.62]Uh-oh.
[133:27.90]Oh, we're good.
[133:28.98]Ooh, got it!
[133:29.62]Hey, do you guys want a two?
[133:54.34]What happened?
[133:55.78]What?
[133:56.36]Do you guys want a 2v2?
[133:56.88]Me and Chief.
[133:57.56]Wait a second.
[133:58.50]We're in the middle of a game.
[133:59.84]For a second, I thought this was the person that we were playing in the game.
[134:02.08]And I was like, is this voice chat?
[134:05.12]Yeah, they added that.
[134:05.94]All chat.
[134:06.77]All chat voice chat.
[134:09.41]Oh, we got it.
[134:09.95]We got it right there.
[134:11.15]All right.
[134:11.93]That's one and one.
[134:12.51]That's one and one.
[134:12.99]Do you guys want to play when you're done with this though?
[134:18.25]Or not?
[134:18.71]Yeah, we'll play a game too.
[134:20.58]Yeah, I'm done.
[134:21.10]Okay.
[134:24.03]Um, I'll add you guys.
[134:25.11]Did you put your info?
[134:26.49]Yeah, it's in there somewhere, I think.
[134:27.79]Yeah, I have mine.
[134:30.29]Sick.
[134:30.99]Thank you.
[134:32.09]Mine's not really in there.
[134:33.55]I forgot the numbers.
[134:35.35]Yeah, it's like Scarlet something.
[134:41.78]Focus on these join the voice chat.
[134:43.96]Yeah, it did.
[134:45.12]I don't know.
[134:50.34]I don't know my username.
[135:05.18]Change your username?
[135:06.20]Why?
[135:06.46]I don't want to be Jerma985.
[135:08.24]Someone probably already is Jerma985.
[135:13.90]Yeah, guys, I'm sure it's probably been taken like 5,000 different versions of the name.
[135:21.71]Why not?
[135:23.01]Because back in the TF2 days, this is a real story.
[135:28.92]Back in the TF2 days, if you were making YouTube videos, or whatever, if you were streaming or whatever, not back then, but if your name was like Germa985, and it was confirmed that that's you, there'd be 30 people lining up to high five you, and the game would be ruined.
[135:45.65]So I'm trying to take myself out of the equation.
[135:49.59]It's not me.
[135:50.37]This is just a person playing the game.
[135:52.67]So I always just, ever since, I did it like that.
[135:56.94]That's what I, when people recognize me in a game, I'm just like, oh my god, is that Connor?
[136:00.66]I'm like, no, I'm just a fan.
[136:09.51]That's why I used to, my names used to be like, car dealership, like 200 or something, and people would just be like, who the fuck is this guy?
[136:16.88]I've played with that guy.
[136:17.56]Yeah, he was pretty good.
[136:19.66]Yep.
[136:23.77]Watch that hit.
[136:24.67]Oh my God.
[136:25.51]That was disgusting.
[136:27.23]Oh my goodness gracious.
[136:28.49]That was a delicious combo.
[136:30.87]That was ridiculous.
[136:32.66]I won't let that happen again.
[136:40.16]Taking it to the sky.
[136:40.86]All right.
[136:49.57]They're going to try to run back here.
[136:50.81]Careful.
[137:08.77]Good, good, good.
[137:12.39]Oh, he almost finished that Superman.
[137:31.51]There he goes.
[137:33.13]Oh.
[137:37.02]He grabbed me from behind.
[137:39.61]There it goes.
[137:40.03]There we go.
[137:43.87]Good fight.
[137:46.81]Good fight.
[137:47.33]Is that 2-1?
[137:49.49]That is it, yeah.
[137:50.29]Yeah, we won.
[137:51.41]Yeah, we kicked their ass.
[137:54.45]Good to hear.
[137:56.07]I sent you both friend requests so we can add you.
[137:59.29]German, I think you're the host.
[138:00.89]Oh, yeah.
[138:02.85]I added Dr. Battle.
[138:05.78]Yep.
[138:08.02]And then...
[138:10.77]Oh, wait, we're not doing a... We're just inviting everybody to a party?
[138:13.83]Can you do that, or are we just doing a custom game?
[138:15.21]I was just going to do it the way I did in turn custom, yeah.
[138:18.18]Oh, okay, yeah.
[138:19.44]I've got the custom set up.
[138:21.48]Oh, yeah.
[138:24.54]Are we friends?
[138:25.38]Because I have that... Oh, Dr. Battle, right?
[138:26.74]You gave me error except reading.
[138:29.00]Yeah, Dr. Battle.
[138:29.72]Here we go.
[138:30.26]I got you.
[138:30.56]Oh, I got Scarlet Otter.
[138:31.92]Okay, sending an invite there.
[138:34.70]Jeremiah, you may not have to invite me.
[138:35.95]And then you could invite him, and I'm going to invite Sheep.
[138:38.05]Yeah, I'll pull him.
[138:40.29]Cool, cool.
[138:44.53]Is there a bracket or a mainstream for this tournament anywhere?
[138:47.79]The guy's on YouTube.
[138:49.83]Not on this site.
[138:53.33]And then I'll pull you now.
[138:54.57]Okay.
[139:04.76]Very cool.
[139:07.68]who yeah who's did they finish who's uh who's no they're they're in like losers finals right now I think or maybe they're starting grands I don't remember who's um who's one and two or who's like the top four uh right now it stands in alpharad versus I think they're in game three and they're in game three and then it's jesse and slick waiting in winners of grands and me and sheep got fourth place yep we had the worst seating
[139:35.64]Yeah.
[139:36.14]Who'd you guys start off against?
[139:37.92]Uh, Slick.
[139:39.50]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[139:40.26]They were insane.
[139:40.70]They're very good.
[139:42.04]That was the only one, because we lost to Stans as well, but I felt like those were close.
[139:47.72]But Jesse and Slick fucked us up.
[139:50.18]Yeah, we were pretty close on the second game with them.
[139:53.90]Yeah.
[139:55.82]Here comes the heat!
[140:04.21]Okay.
[140:09.19]Jeremy, please don't play on the Steven Universe stage again.
[140:12.23]Well, we can't like... Everybody hates Steven Universe.
[140:18.08]The Rick and Morty stage.
[140:19.28]Actually, can we adjust the map pool in a custom?
[140:22.14]I think so.
[140:22.44]I know you can pick a specific one, but can you just like take one out?
[140:25.88]Yeah, you can take one out.
[140:26.72]I don't know how you pick a specific one.
[140:31.27]I don't either.
[140:33.29]Oh, shit.
[140:33.59]I gotta pick a character.
[140:36.31]Why aren't my...
[140:38.72]my perks aren't like unlocked that was weird I just played I just picked a bunch of perks I don't know but we haven't locked in yet oh I enjoy oh that's why I was like what look who it is oh yeah those guys one of them had an iron giant right
[140:57.45]I heard they were reducing Iron Giant's size by like 70%.
[141:00.04]He's gonna be shorter than like Bugs Bunny in the next patch.
[141:04.40]They heard a lot of complaints.
[141:05.20]He's just Iron Guy now.
[141:06.84]Iron Guy.
[141:08.99]Iron Gentleman.
[141:18.50]It's that orchestra one.
[141:19.48]Please, we can't hear it anymore.
[141:23.60]We'll turn the sound off and put on your favorite podcast.
[141:32.10]The Stands Show.
[141:34.88]Which needs a new episode.
[141:36.82]We've been working on them.
[141:38.42]I'm going to laugh if we're just on that stage.
[141:41.14]The person's going to leave.
[141:41.82]I think it's Rick and Morty.
[141:43.41]Oh yeah, it's Rick and Morty.
[141:46.79]Rick and Morty.
[141:52.21]Let's do it.
[141:54.84]All right.
[142:13.87]Freeze.
[142:20.22]It's true, you cannot guard LeBron.
[142:22.09]Nope.
[142:22.91]He's 6'8".
[142:23.59]He's the GOAT.
[142:26.64]Ooh!
[142:27.36]But you can hit him with a car.
[142:37.88]Get rid of that shit.
[142:39.52]I should have gone LeBron against Iron Giant.
[142:41.10]I feel like he fucks him up.
[142:44.12]You are LeBron.
[142:45.60]I know, but when we fought Slick.
[142:47.20]Oh, I was like... I was like, uh-oh, I'm wrong.
[142:57.02]Oh no, that was supposed to be a punch.
[143:02.29]Uh-oh.
[143:06.81]Very cool, Superman.
[143:12.83]Oh my god, how am I still on stage?
[143:14.05]I don't know.
[143:18.65]That was close.
[143:21.61]Nice.
[143:22.33]What?
[143:22.83]Did you bounce off something?
[143:24.09]I don't know.
[143:24.77]I like bounced back.
[143:28.09]I feel like that happened to me a couple times in the tournament to be honest.
[143:31.53]There I go.
[143:35.01]It's okay to lose.
[143:38.29]I'm in gun mode.
[143:48.89]You're not a gun.
[143:52.07]I feel like the gun mode is worse.
[143:54.35]I'm in it too.
[143:55.95]Shooting.
[143:57.85]They don't know what to do.
[144:00.91]Damn.
[144:04.58]You guys are sticking around.
[144:10.61]That ain't good.
[144:11.95]We're alright.
[144:15.97]Get like another 100 on me and I'll be done.
[144:20.99]Oh my goodness, I thought you flew off.
[144:27.13]How the hell are you not dead?
[144:29.05]Iron Giant.
[144:31.27]It's okay to die, it's not okay to kill.
[144:37.18]Bully the Superman.
[144:43.21]Damn it, that was supposed to be a punch.
[144:45.55]Can you grab me?
[144:51.24]Oh no!
[144:51.82]Uh oh.
[144:59.09]Goodbye!
[144:59.45]Woah!
[145:00.17]There it is!
[145:00.51]That was sick, that was sick.
[145:02.53]That was really close.
[145:03.41]Yeah, that was really close.
[145:04.55]Superman's tough to finish.
[145:06.77]Yeah, he's so annoying.
[145:08.21]He's tricky.
[145:10.80]I feel like the Iron Giant's got that, too.
[145:13.04]Like, you gotta follow up on him to kill him, because it's gonna be hard to kill him just from the stage.
[145:17.24]Yeah, you gotta, like, bounce, bounce, bounce, just follow him up.
[145:19.84]Especially when you start flying, it's just like, just go onto the feet, just trying to knock him a little higher.
[145:24.51]Yeah, that's the thing.
[145:25.33]He's huge.
[145:26.49]Stop eating raw pork.
[145:27.69]I've been eating carrots.
[145:28.95]What are people talking about?
[145:30.65]Real carrots or baby carrots?
[145:31.81]Raw pork is very dangerous.
[145:33.85]The carrots that are like a big pencil.
[145:35.95]You know what I mean?
[145:37.25]Okay, yeah.
[145:42.20]It's audible.
[145:43.46]It's very clear.
[145:44.82]Is there any doctors here?
[145:46.09]Like, if I eat, like, carrots for four hours, is that bad?
[145:48.69]Like, I've been eating carrots for two straight hours.
[145:51.07]No, that's fine.
[145:51.95]You probably can't OD on carrots.
[145:53.35]I think if you ate carrots for four hours straight every day, then eventually, like, you're gonna start shitting weird or something, but I don't think you're gonna be in danger.
[146:01.64]God.
[146:10.02]You can turn orange if you eat too many carrots.
[146:13.48]That sounds like a lie.
[146:14.59]How do I look?
[146:14.97]Is this double LeBron?
[146:23.27]Oh no.
[146:24.95]Yeah, we'll be in weirdos.
[146:25.67]There's going to be so many basketballs.
[146:27.55]I know.
[146:28.11]Like two, I guess.
[146:30.85]I think he can have four active though, can't he?
[146:32.93]Like two, I mean two at a time.
[146:34.99]Yep.
[146:35.37]Can he have one that's like free falling and then he can still do basketball moves?
[146:39.03]Yeah, if you bounce one, his down special...
[146:42.93]The guy said I turned orange and ate too many carrots one time.
[146:44.99]I need to go to the hospital.
[146:46.29]What?
[146:47.37]That's what that guy just said.
[146:48.71]Don't say that.
[146:49.37]Watch out.
[146:49.89]Wrong way.
[147:18.18]Jesus, I'm getting dunked on by the all-time scoring leader.
[147:22.45]Yup.
[147:22.93]This might be a double LeBron team, Jeremy.
[147:31.95]This might be us.
[147:33.27]We've been playing well with the double LeBron.
[147:41.08]Ooh.
[147:44.80]Oh, I'm trying to play around here.
[147:46.62]That was close.
[147:55.07]get hit with basketball oh oh my god we're going crazy bounce bounce I don't think teams should be allowed to have eight finals wins combined that was lucky that I stayed alive hey stop
[148:30.00]Give me that bomb!
[148:45.11]Oh my goodness!
[149:06.30]Ah, I thought I hit him.
[149:07.20]Oh, it's alright.
[149:07.84]We're good.
[149:10.70]Yeah, that was... That was... Oh, for a second.
[149:14.08]For a second, I thought you ended the game when you got Connor.
[149:17.74]I thought we knew... No, we won.
[149:20.04]Look at how happy LeBrons are.
[149:24.50]How come they couldn't get LeBron to do the voice lines?
[149:28.19]We were talking about that earlier.
[149:29.57]He doesn't know he's in the game.
[149:31.07]I heard that they're working on that, though.
[149:33.84]I watched a video that talked about this game and they said that LeBron was going to do the voice lines.
[149:38.40]Either they're misinformed or they're not.
[149:41.86]I guess it has to be one of them, right?
[149:45.03]All right, let's change it up.
[149:46.17]What do I want to do?
[149:46.71]People just like lie for no reason sometimes.
[149:50.67]Yeah, it's true.
[149:54.75]Kind of insta-locked LeBron.
[149:59.67]I should have changed it.
[150:02.65]Jerma, your eyes are turning orange.
[150:04.22]Yeah, a lot of people have been saying that.
[150:11.00]LeBron's really fun to play.
[150:14.25]Yeah, he's great.
[150:18.99]Eat.
[150:20.37]Play Bugs Bunny, you carrot eater.
[150:22.45]I played Bugs all day.
[150:26.18]Show them what we got.
[150:32.47]So how do you guys like the game?
[150:35.17]I think it's fine.
[150:36.53]I don't, I play melee mostly, so I don't know how much I'm going to not play melee for this, but I'm having fun being there in giant.
[150:42.95]Yeah, I like it.
[150:44.75]I don't know how much competitive legs it has, but it's fun.
[150:53.59]You were playing a lot during the first beta, right Jeremy?
[150:57.58]Yeah, I played a decent during their first beta.
[151:00.60]I played it off stream a lot too.
[151:06.89]I really like it.
[151:07.43]I have fun with it.
[151:09.69]Yeah, it's super fun.
[151:12.51]I like just the netcode alone.
[151:13.79]It's enough for me to want to play it.
[151:15.58]Yeah.
[151:18.18]I'm getting stalled on right now.
[151:19.28]I don't like it.
[151:19.98]It's amazing how Nintendo still doesn't have an online system.
[151:25.30]Zoom action.
[151:29.96]I mean, the idea is if, you know, if Warner Brothers is going to support this and really care about it, then, oh, yeah, hope they do.
[151:35.72]Yeah.
[151:36.76]Did you see that information about how much people... Like, Evo was this last weekend, and, like, fifth place for multiverses, which was a side game, got more than, like, first place for some of the main games.
[151:47.57]Really?
[151:47.95]Yeah.
[151:49.71]Holy shit.
[151:50.69]I think 17th place for multiverses, again, a side game, got more than, like, fifth place for some games or something.
[151:57.55]There was a...
[151:58.79]Practical tasks tweet about it.
[152:00.11]I can't remember all the details, but Warner Brothers put a lot of money into this game.
[152:04.41]They should do something for this tournament.
[152:07.56]That'd be cool.
[152:11.80]Maybe fourth, even fifth, I don't know.
[152:14.78]Tied for fifth place should have seen, you know, $700,000 or something like that.
[152:18.78]Yeah.
[152:20.64]Which means fourth place is probably 1.2 at that point, right?
[152:25.55]Yeah, that'd be like 1.3.
[152:26.37]Yeah, maybe.
[152:28.13]I'd say that makes sense.
[152:30.39]I'll take like some Fortnite V-Bucks or something at this point.
[152:35.83]What?
[152:40.53]That was crazy.
[152:41.43]Did you just run out of resources?
[152:43.09]Yeah, I just was hoping I caught somebody in it.
[152:45.75]Ran out of basketballs.
[152:48.53]I mean, I feel like you guys just went easy on us because you didn't go double LeBron again.
[152:54.10]My TAS was not very good that round.
[153:00.18]Yeah, I mean like a, I don't know, like a 50 to 100 million dollar tournament.
[153:04.58]You know, the first 100 places get, you know, place 100 gets like 200,000 or something like that.
[153:11.23]And it's just people that Ludwig knows off the top of his head in the tournament.
[153:15.29]Not like top players only or anything, just, you know.
[153:19.15]What's the biggest prize pool ever?
[153:21.77]Is it that Dota tournament?
[153:24.33]Oh, like ever, ever?
[153:25.05]Dota's had a lot of big ones.
[153:26.71]Dota's had like 10 to 20 million, right?
[153:30.91]I want to say it's got to be Dota, but I'm not 100% sure.
[153:33.74]I know that... I know CS has had some really big prize pools, but I don't know if they compare.
[153:40.96]Yeah, Dota 2 had a 47 million prize pool.
[153:45.54]Wow.
[153:46.14]I was saying that as a joke.
[153:47.28]That actually happened.
[153:48.94]How many people get that?
[153:50.09]15 million.
[153:52.83]Like, is that just the winning team, or is it like the top four teams?
[153:55.23]It's the prize pool, so I imagine it was spread.
[153:57.45]Yeah, it's probably spread.
[153:59.42]That's like winning the Mega Millions jackpot.
[154:02.02]That's like the type of crazy number.
[154:03.88]That's like life-changing in a way that is changing the future generations of your family's way, too.
[154:10.88]That's gotta be like a money laundering scheme.
[154:13.42]Over 18 million went to Team 1.
[154:15.91]There's no way that... How much was Team 2?
[154:17.69]Who's watching that?
[154:20.75]Cause if team two got like 9 million, can you imagine playing a game of Dota for $9 million?
[154:26.77]I would, I would shit my pants.
[154:28.57]It's like, I better hit W at the right time or otherwise I might lose $9 million.
[154:33.23]I probably would fucking puke, right?
[154:35.87]Like how it's so much like nerves, like geez, like 10 million, $20 million.
[154:42.13]But at the same time, you've already won $9 million, so maybe the nerves go away.
[154:45.55]You're like, I'm already set.
[154:46.45]This is just extra.
[154:47.85]What's the difference between $9 and $18 million, really?
[154:54.21]True.
[154:54.47]Hey, what's the best LeBron move that I can just use?
[155:02.15]His side special is like an almost instant kill if they have at least 50 to 60 damage.
[155:06.33]Or at least like 70.
[155:08.98]It has no priority though, so you really have to land it.
[155:15.98]Woo!
[155:16.57]Don't!
[155:16.95]Don't!
[155:17.35]Don't!
[155:18.49]No!
[155:20.89]Damn, you hit me like seven times.
[155:22.87]I know.
[155:24.47]That's what I kept missing in the tournament.
[155:26.75]The Superman is a Superman.
[155:33.22]What the hell?
[155:46.58]Oh, orange, orange.
[155:50.70]Did I hit you with that bat?
[155:51.64]That was crazy.
[155:52.32]You were like far away.
[155:57.93]Oh my God, that bounce.
[155:59.17]I'm alive, I'm alive.
[156:02.03]Oh my God.
[156:03.15]I've never seen someone with faster knockback than in that move right there.
[156:06.75]It's so good.
[156:07.21]I got deleted.
[156:24.15]No, I'm living.
[156:28.31]Oh, I was out there to try to kill you in case he didn't.
[156:34.00]Oh.
[156:34.50]I'm dead.
[156:34.82]I'm dead.
[156:36.36]Which point?
[156:46.50]Oh, so close.
[156:47.39]131.
[156:47.41]I like it.
[156:56.26]Oh my goodness!
[156:57.18]Is that a kill?
[156:58.90]Oh my god, how did you... Through the floor.
[157:02.08]Oh, that was unbelievable.
[157:03.90]Wait, did you go in the floor?
[157:05.00]No, I did the dunk and he was jumping up through the floor.
[157:08.22]Wow.
[157:09.58]That was insane.
[157:10.86]Yeah, I came up through the tunnel.
[157:14.49]All I did was get kills.
[157:15.21]That was it.
[157:16.45]No damage.
[157:17.57]Hey, that's what you need.
[157:20.03]You need someone to hold the line or you need someone to throw the ball, you know?
[157:23.41]That was crazy.
[157:27.04]Did somebody win this tournament yet?
[157:28.14]What happened?
[157:30.38]It's probably wrapping up.
[157:31.80]I'm not totally sure.
[157:34.48]We're going to take it back up tomorrow.
[157:38.25]It's Ludwig and Alpharad together.
[157:41.55]Wait, really?
[157:42.75]I think Stanz had to dip.
[157:44.41]Oh, okay.
[157:44.79]Yeah, Stanz said he had to leave at 425.
[157:46.05]That would be it then.
[157:47.75]So I'm guessing that they made it to Grands and then Stanz has to leave.
[157:50.81]Holy shit.
[157:53.44]I'll take his money.
[157:56.80]Wouldn't mind.
[157:59.08]He only deserves second place money.
[158:00.89]Even if they win, he doesn't deserve the first place money.
[158:04.69]The amount difference between second and first should go, I don't know, maybe to fourth.
[158:08.83]I guess, right?
[158:09.91]Just go to fourth.
[158:11.15]I'll split it with tied fifth, even.
[158:12.51]I mean, it's true, but probably fifth place should see at least, you know, a hundred, two hundred.
[158:17.20]Maybe.
[158:17.62]Yeah, that's what we were saying.
[158:18.34]We were saying a hundred bucks for fourth.
[158:20.34]Ludwig was pretending to not read it.
[158:22.34]So...
[158:25.32]Oh Steven Universe that person's fucking gone Ron really don't so hard the ball disappears, huh?
[158:41.35]That's crazy, it's like that in real life too They're not gonna make 20 balls to the game Actually, there probably is 20 balls in the game
[158:53.32]they go through basketballs like baseball goes through baseballs or do they use the same ball the whole game I don't that's a great question that's a really good question I feel like no way I feel like basketball probably goes through eight balls for no reason every dunk they can switch it up
[159:15.03]no football they switch the ball all the time they do well teams get their own balls too they bring their own balls to game yeah because some pitch like some quarterbacks like the ball to be uh inflated really worn out yeah really worn out and some like oh yeah they do that in the super bowl
[159:41.79]I need to kill Jerma.
[159:47.13]Yeah.
[159:48.27]Yeah.
[159:48.96]What's up?
[159:50.30]I need to tell you.
[159:51.34]Oh, I thought you said I need to tell Jerma.
[159:52.96]Like, I need to tell you something.
[159:54.16]No, he needs to kill you.
[159:55.40]I need to be honest.
[159:56.32]Jerma, I got to tell you.
[159:57.46]Everything you've known about me has been a fraud.
[159:59.62]My whole life.
[160:01.67]What?
[160:03.47]What are you doing?
[160:04.29]I lost the ball.
[160:04.87]I was chasing it.
[160:05.49]Couldn't get it.
[160:06.47]Doesn't this come back to you?
[160:07.69]I have to like, use it.
[160:10.05]Use a cooldown.
[160:12.00]Which is fine.
[160:12.92]I'm not upset about it.
[160:15.18]If LeBron throws the ball to Reindog, he should say fetch.
[160:23.32]Oh my goodness!
[160:25.13]You're very high there, Jeremy.
[160:27.05]And not just on carrots.
[160:29.56]Getting high on carrots.
[160:31.86]Yeah, I've been, like, smoking these off-camera.
[160:34.06]THC-laced carrots.
[160:36.68]We gotta get some kills here, I'm gonna say.
[160:42.09]Jeremy's already dead.
[160:44.85]But I'm also very high percent.
[160:51.81]Were you just riding that rocket all the way across the map?
[160:54.09]It was just like homing onto you.
[160:55.25]I like where I go.
[160:59.81]That's pretty cool.
[161:08.06]Loving this.
[161:09.10]Oh my goodness.
[161:11.50]Oh, there I go.
[161:12.20]We have ourselves a rabbit, Hayden.
[161:21.08]I'm like halfway to kill myself.
[161:23.31]That was a big hit.
[161:31.13]No, let me go!
[161:32.73]We are very high percentage on this.
[161:35.80]I'm working on it.
[161:36.42]Give me your suit.
[161:39.02]I don't know what happens when we get tied together.
[161:48.58]I think there's like a button that you can press that like leashes him back to you.
[161:53.32]Yeah, when he's off stage.
[161:57.36]No!
[161:58.06]I was in the middle of comboing!
[162:01.40]Oh, I could have... I probably would have dropped it, but I felt like I could have got it.
[162:05.35]Hey, game three.
[162:07.25]This one's for all the marbles.
[162:08.53]Game three.
[162:09.15]$1,000?
[162:09.79]This one's for all the marbles.
[162:12.47]You had 600 damage, dude.
[162:13.73]Yeah, Rhindog was just kind of hitting everybody.
[162:16.87]Support character, huh?
[162:19.71]Oh my god.
[162:22.67]Yeah, jeez.
[162:23.97]It looks like you turned on the stream by accident.
[162:29.55]That's how I feel sometimes when I'm focused on gaming.
[162:31.29]What does that mean?
[162:33.07]Okay, if it's all the marbles.
[162:34.53]It's kind of funny because I know exactly what they mean.
[162:38.33]Like, I get it.
[162:39.71]I know what you mean.
[162:40.30]Like you're just chilling, playing multiverses, hanging out.
[162:42.74]Yeah, we're just like chilling.
[162:44.86]That's it.
[162:45.66]Sometimes it's like that.
[162:46.56]Whatever.
[162:48.12]That's how streams should feel.
[162:49.42]Ever heard of Clint Stevens?
[162:51.86]Ban that person for one full 60 seconds.
[162:53.96]Stop enjoying the game.
[163:03.82]Oh, but I like the game.
[163:10.91]That'll teach him.
[163:14.20]Yeah, then VIP them.
[163:15.82]Then ban them again.
[163:18.44]Then put them on stream and they can say literally whatever they want for 10 seconds and then permanently ban them and then VIP them.
[163:25.54]And then permanently ban them.
[163:29.83]You're just tossing them around at this point.
[163:32.09]Yeah, I really want to just, like, you know, fuck with them.
[163:34.99]Show them what we got.
[163:53.17]Drunk on carrots.
[163:58.76]Alright, this is for the marbles, right?
[164:00.44]Yeah, all the marbles.
[164:01.60]Every last marble.
[164:04.54]Oh, I can't believe that.
[164:08.76]Oh, man.
[164:38.06]Oh, damn it.
[164:38.56]Oh, my God.
[164:43.94]Holy.
[164:44.66]Oh, that killed.
[164:45.32]I did not think I was going to die.
[164:46.76]They're doing pretty good.
[164:49.23]Didn't want to throw the ball.
[164:52.37]Might be a Rindog player now.
[164:54.55]Nope.
[164:55.85]Maybe not.
[164:57.39]No, he's still very good.
[165:00.19]Oh, I was trying to bounce that back to you.
[165:15.15]Ooh, there I go.
[165:16.45]Oh, yes!
[165:16.95]Oh my god.
[165:18.23]That's what I'm talking about.
[165:19.75]Okay, that was good.
[165:28.42]This is even though.
[165:50.85]Oh, careful.
[165:52.74]Whoa.
[165:53.42]Let's go.
[165:54.53]Oh, man.
[165:57.66]Nuts game.
[165:58.34]I was like, maybe if I'm going offstage, it'll bring me out to you, and then nope.
[166:02.70]Why didn't we get to play in the tournament?
[166:05.34]That would have been exciting.
[166:06.82]That was a good matchup.
[166:08.22]I think it was pretty even squeedens.
[166:10.34]Shock with the four kills, 300 damage.
[166:13.54]I feel like I'm always at 360.
[166:14.86]Ludwig didn't get the best match of the day on his stream.
[166:18.88]We know he did.
[166:19.52]He didn't.
[166:20.30]That was probably a more entertaining, two best of threes, both more entertaining than every set Ludwig has today.
[166:26.82]That was a good fight.
[166:27.34]Good match.
[166:28.15]Nice playing with you guys.
[166:29.43]That was awesome.
[166:30.86]I had a lot of fun.
[166:33.69]Hey, multiverses.
[166:35.19]Let's do more events.
[166:36.71]More events.
[166:37.43]It's fun.
[166:38.55]Weekly Ludwig tournaments until one of us wins.
[166:42.63]Yeah.
[166:43.43]Yeah, until we all get a couple thousand dollars.
[166:46.52]I think all the placements should just make the same.
[166:49.04]I mean, why award based on how good you did?
[166:53.86]That makes people feel bad.
[166:55.66]So let's just, you know.
[166:56.70]Hey, I'm already being fifth place.
[166:59.10]$100 to fourth and fifth.
[167:00.35]Or four and a half, right?
[167:01.69]Technically.
[167:03.27]Yeah.
[167:06.29]Hey, you guys have good streams.
[167:07.29]I'm out now.
[167:07.97]Yeah.
[167:09.15]Nice playing, guys.
[167:09.97]See you maybe in the next Ludwig event.
[167:12.45]Who knows?
[167:14.43]Ooh, Fortnite.
[167:17.70]Are you going to keep playing?
[167:19.30]Is that it for you?
[167:20.82]How do you feel?
[167:22.46]I think I might go play something else a bit soon.
[167:24.90]Alright.
[167:27.82]It's been fun, though.
[167:29.07]It has been a good time.
[167:31.41]Hey, we had a good showing.
[167:32.95]I think we did.
[167:33.81]We played pretty well.
[167:34.65]We really did.
[167:35.83]We lost to the two winners finals teams.
[167:38.24]I think grand finals teams.
[167:40.30]So, you know, at the end of the day, some are saying we were the best team there.
[167:44.54]Yeah, I say one of the best teams.
[167:46.18]We're one of the top eight teams there.
[167:49.44]That is true.
[167:49.96]We were in the top eight.
[167:53.70]Yeah, it's always a pleasure, dude.
[167:55.71]Dude, of course.
[167:56.21]It was fun.
[167:56.89]Have a great rest of your stream.
[167:58.35]Yeah, we'll talk soon.
[167:59.47]I'll see you.
[168:00.47]Take care, dude.
[168:04.64]Alright, so that's that.
[168:09.31]That was multi-versus tournament.
[168:11.03]Honestly, we played really well.
[168:14.69]If we had... We probably could have been fourth or third.
[168:19.12]We probably could have.
[168:23.70]That was a lot of fun, though.
[168:24.60]It's fun to play a game and be kind of good at it.
[168:26.98]Like, be okay at it.
[168:30.88]Are you going to leave?
[168:32.20]Yes.
[168:33.48]So for those of you that aren't aware, I'm still dealing with an obnoxious fucking medical problem that it just comes and goes, comes and goes, and it's causing me a ton of problems.
[168:44.21]I'm fine, but I need, like I said before, I want to do more streams this week, but less time.
[168:50.42]And I didn't stream yesterday.
[168:51.42]I wanted to go like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[168:54.52]But we started on Wednesday.
[168:56.30]We're going to do Wednesday.
[168:57.34]Tomorrow, I believe, I'm going to go check and see.
[169:00.32]I think the Myth Call of Duty thing is tomorrow.
[169:04.08]So more networking Andy tomorrow.
[169:07.56]That should be funny.
[169:08.16]Okay, because I played well today.
[169:11.72]I'm going to be the worst fucking player on any team tomorrow.
[169:15.10]It's going to be embarrassing.
[169:16.40]So if you want to watch me make an absolute fool out of myself in Call of Duty, it's not going to be funny.
[169:20.24]It's going to be embarrassing for all of us as a collective entire community.
[169:25.17]So I hope you're ready.
[169:27.99]But if that happens, if that happens, it'll be, I might stream my perspective.
[169:32.71]If not, that'll be on Myth's channel on YouTube.
[169:35.32]We'll see.
[169:36.38]But on Friday, we're going to do Two Point Campus.
[169:40.16]And then maybe Mortuary Assistant.
[169:43.72]And then Sunday is Green Screen Movie Night.
[169:45.46]And then Monday, we're doing a Hangout stream where we talk about baseball.
[169:49.35]And then obviously baseball is a few days later.
[169:52.69]And then we'll do Sorcery when I come back from baseball.
[169:58.65]So we'll see.
[169:59.21]But yeah, I'm trying to not sit here for too long.
[170:04.52]I'll leave out the minute details, but there's been some annoying things I've had to deal with over the last week or two.
[170:11.20]But I'm alright.
[170:11.64]I'll be fine.
[170:12.40]I'll be good for baseball.
[170:14.63]But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[170:16.13]We'll go for like another three or four hours tomorrow, and then Friday will be a little longer.
[170:19.35]Because we're probably going to play two games on Friday.
[170:23.82]Is it the back problem?
[170:24.68]It's a combination of a few things that have just... It's just been a thorn in my side for the last two or three weeks.
[170:32.59]But I'm good.
[170:33.19]I'm alright.
[170:33.79]I feel okay today, right?
[170:35.41]But I don't want to go too hard.
[170:38.73]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[170:41.23]Keep an eye on what's happening with the Call of Duty thing.
[170:45.76]If there is... If for some reason there is no Call of Duty thing, then we'll play something tomorrow.
[170:49.82]We'll do something else.
[170:50.96]So there'll be a stream tomorrow.
[170:54.56]And with that, we'll raid Connor, because we were just playing with Connor.
[170:57.32]I think Connor's still streaming.
[171:02.27]Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[171:04.19]Also, obviously, thanks to Ludwig for the invite.
[171:07.41]Are they still doing their... Is it over?
[171:09.95]I don't know, but that was awesome.
[171:16.88]Thanks for watching, obviously.
[171:17.84]If you're around tomorrow, you're around tomorrow.
[171:22.71]Either the Mortuary Assistant or Myth's Call of Duty event.
[171:28.26]I'll put a sus command when I figure out everything.
[171:34.76]Yeah, we'll raid Connor.
[171:40.09]Let's go for it.
[171:45.76]I need a horror game.
[171:47.28]The only reason why I wouldn't do the mortuary system tomorrow is if I don't want to be like screaming and tense up and have a problem and then fuck myself up.
[171:56.00]So we'll see tomorrow.
[171:57.18]There will be a stream tomorrow.
[171:58.62]We'll see what it is.
[172:06.71]We'll wing it.
[172:10.45]Thanks again, guys.
[172:13.55]And here we go.
[172:13.97]It's Ray Conner.
[172:16.31]Whatever Connor is doing.
[172:20.06]Thanks.
[172:20.40]I wasn't paying too much attention to much because I was focusing on obviously trying to win.
[172:24.96]But that was multiverses.
[172:25.96]Go get it.
[172:26.78]Go try it.
[172:27.42]The game's free and it's fun.
[172:29.16]That's all that needs to be said about it.
[172:31.58]What time tomorrow?
[172:33.28]Probably around the same time as I started today.
[172:34.88]Probably around 2 or 3 o'clock Pacific.
[172:46.31]That was a chill tournament stream.
[172:47.49]Yeah, sometimes you just play games.
[172:49.09]And that's fine.
[172:54.47]I gotta prove that I know how to use a controller.
[172:56.48]I gotta prove that I don't hold the controller upside down every stream.
[172:59.20]Alright.
[173:05.84]Alright.
[173:07.78]Goodnight, guys.
[173:08.16]See you soon.
[173:10.33]Take care.
[173:10.79]Call your mother.
[173:12.45]Have a great night.
[173:18.61]you
