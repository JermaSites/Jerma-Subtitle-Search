[00:08.78]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.82]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:15.47]And tonight, gonna be playing as the heavy on Badwater on offense.
[00:20.95]Gonna be using the default minigun, the strange sandwich, that's not true, the regular sandwich.
[00:28.17]I don't think there is a strange sandwich.
[00:30.20]And the Gloves of Running Urgently, as you see right here.
[00:34.72]So this commentary is going to be a little bit different, going to be a little more strange, a little more weird.
[00:38.68]See what I did there?
[00:40.14]I just drank like five coffees and I decided, what if I drop all my conventional wisdoms of commentary and just hit record after having a bunch of caffeine and just let loose and see what I say and see what happens.
[00:53.51]I'll talk about what happens on the screen.
[00:54.81]I'm going to talk about random stuff, but you know, whatever, let's just go.
[00:58.55]So this is going to be called...
[01:00.31]The Coffee Commentary of Justice and Doom!
[01:05.28]Rated R. As you can see, this already is going off to a great start.
[01:13.80]So what am I going to talk about?
[01:14.66]Let's talk about, of course, what's going on on the screen, and what am I doing here?
[01:17.94]Well, it's Team Fortress 2, for one thing, one of my favorite games.
[01:21.42]Okay, that really just scared the crap out of me.
[01:23.68]I forgot that happened, and I felt like I was in the game.
[01:27.34]Scout, will you get out of my face?
[01:28.60]I'm trying to talk to my friends!
[01:30.85]Thank you.
[01:31.31]He's gone.
[01:33.05]But I forgot that happened.
[01:34.27]And I actually couldn't believe I was still alive at this point.
[01:36.35]A soldier comes around the corner.
[01:38.62]Right here, I think it is.
[01:39.70]And he starts shooting at me.
[01:40.74]And I don't die.
[01:41.42]I couldn't believe I was still alive.
[01:44.12]I was praying I wasn't going to die.
[01:45.62]Because obviously I wanted to keep this run going.
[01:48.30]And this run does go for a pretty long damn time.
[01:53.22]And that is a spy.
[01:54.83]You're dead.
[01:55.59]Twice.
[01:56.93]So talking about Badwater for a minute here, I want to bring up... Don't get me wrong, I love Badwater.
[02:01.95]Badwater is probably my second or third favorite map in this game.
[02:06.12]But while you're attacking, it is the most frustrating thing if they have a good defense on the last point.
[02:12.24]And hold on a second.
[02:14.60]That was the noise he made.
[02:17.93]So, attacking on Badwater, the last point, is almost impossible if they have a good defense.
[02:22.17]It is almost impossible, and it's the most frustrating thing, because you'll see, once we get up to this second-to-last checkpoint, and we start turning the corner, we start going around, it stops to a snail's pace, like a legit slug.
[02:34.64]We are slugs when we get around this corner.
[02:37.22]And look at how fast we've been going.
[02:38.54]We have been absolutely rolling this whole entire time,
[02:42.22]And what stops us is a couple of level three centuries down the bottom.
[02:46.21]And nobody can really get down there because, of course, it's on an incline.
[02:48.93]And everyone's kind of down in the pit just tossing up grenades and, like, throwing firebombs and firecrackers on your front lawn.
[02:57.14]And it can be very frustrating.
[02:58.90]So, I mean, I had to cut.
[03:00.61]Like four minutes off of this gameplay.
[03:03.01]Specifically because it was just me jumping down to my death.
[03:06.23]Getting slaughtered by the sentry guns every two seconds.
[03:09.57]And it was just failed push after failed push after failed push.
[03:12.78]So I figured chew the fat off a little bit.
[03:15.00]Get you the good stuff.
[03:15.84]Get you the real milk and cookies of the gameplay.
[03:18.30]And you get to see the ending too.
[03:19.40]So don't worry.
[03:21.00]So now I got less than 150 health, this is not a good position to be in.
[03:24.61]Run away from that cart.
[03:26.65]I shoot this soldier right in his spinal cavity, right where it hurts the absolute goddamn most.
[03:32.34]And now I want to talk about this hat.
[03:35.00]A lot of people ask me, Germo, what the hell is that thing on your head?
[03:38.72]Is that the Eiffel Tower?
[03:39.80]What the hell is that goddamn thing?
[03:41.86]And I will explain.
[03:43.37]I got that hat from a gift from the Critscast guys.
[03:46.47]They give away, I think, every week they do a show when they give away a hat.
[03:50.61]And that's the hat they give away.
[03:51.63]It's the Vintage Lo-Fi Longwave, I think it's called.
[03:55.11]And you can only get it if you get Player of the Week.
[03:57.13]And that sniper...
[03:59.11]Oh, I was so mad at that guy.
[04:01.90]My hand buried down into my keyboard.
[04:04.66]I was so pissed about that, because I thought I could stay alive and get a full game, one life, but it didn't happen.
[04:10.54]But yeah, I got that from the Critscast guys.
[04:12.06]They're really cool dudes.
[04:13.41]I may, in fact, be on the Critscast at some point.
[04:17.25]I don't know when.
[04:18.05]I mean, we kind of went back and forth about maybe doing something, but I'm not sure.
[04:21.43]Maybe in the future you'll see me on that podcast.
[04:24.24]But anyways, let's return to the gameplay.
[04:27.46]Seeing this sentry right here, I know I can outrange it, because the engineer is kaput.
[04:31.26]He is dead.
[04:32.52]And the lower right, a spy just sapped that one as well.
[04:35.32]So right now, we have like a little tea party going on in this cart now.
[04:38.78]We are gonna win this.
[04:40.10]There's no reason why we can lose.
[04:41.92]I can't think of one reason.
[04:43.14]We're gonna win.
[04:44.02]We won the game, right?
[04:46.26]You f***ing sniper.
[04:48.99]We were gonna win right there, man.
[04:50.47]Come on.
[04:51.07]Why'd you do that?
[04:52.95]Alright, we got over it.
[04:53.73]We're good now.
[04:55.71]So I bump into a Dead Ringer spy right here.
[04:57.96]Either that or it was lag, and I feel like that happens more often than it should.
[05:01.82]Well, you gotta... What the hell?
[05:03.46]Did I bump into somebody?
[05:04.76]But it turns out you didn't.
[05:06.24]But anyways, this is the end of the gameplay.
[05:07.80]We win the game right here.
[05:08.80]Top fragging as House Targaryen.
[05:12.03]If you watch Game of Thrones, you'll understand that reference.
[05:14.95]It's a very good show.
[05:15.81]I could go on for hours about that show, but I'll do that a different time.
[05:20.39]So let me know if you guys like this new style of commentary.
[05:22.88]Not going to do it every single time, but just trying something a little different.
[05:26.52]So I'll see you guys all soon.
[05:28.53]That wraps up the video and I'll catch you guys all next time.
[05:31.51]So take care, everybody.
