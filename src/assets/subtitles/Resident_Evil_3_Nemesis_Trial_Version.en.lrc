[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.60]Alright, we have to do something else.
[00:03.12]Because I'm seriously...
[00:32.82]Where is it?
[00:34.27]Why is it not in here?
[00:35.99]Wait, hold on, wait, do I have, wait, no.
[00:42.17]Why is, what?
[00:53.90]Resident Evil 3.
[00:56.03]Oh God, this is a demo disk.
[00:59.72]This is a... Oh, it's because it came... Oh, it comes with that.
[01:04.06]It comes with the Resident Evil 3 demo disk.
[01:06.40]I know what we're doing.
[01:07.22]Alright.
[01:21.16]Where is fucking Dino Crisis?
[01:25.02]Give me a fucking break, man.
[01:32.78]I have no idea.
[01:34.28]That is a fucking question for the agent.
[01:35.70]We're going to play the Resident Evil 3 demo.
[01:41.59]I was so gung-ho there for a minute.
[01:47.25]What do you mean I didn't save?
[01:50.32]Yeah, I did, didn't I?
[01:50.96]Okay.
[02:04.60]I haven't played Resident Evil 3.
[02:06.08]Like, we gotta get... Wait, this is original PlayStation 1.
[02:09.68]How much content is in the demo disk?
[02:13.86]I didn't save.
[02:14.52]It's alright.
[02:15.08]What disk was that?
[02:16.10]I'm surrounded... I'm covered in discs.
[02:20.51]There are discs all over me.
[02:22.89]There are discs in every single part of my life right now.
[02:26.15]There's a disk over here.
[02:27.37]There's a disk over here.
[02:28.59]I got discs in front of me.
[02:29.89]I got discs all over me.
[02:33.43]Covered in discs.
[02:34.27]I don't even want to do this.
[02:37.98]Ready?
[02:38.64]Resident Evil 3.
[02:40.62]Holy shit, you didn't even say the number.
[03:04.33]What a piece of shit game.
[03:05.89]It all began as an ordinary day in September.
[03:09.27]An ordinary day in Raccoon City.
[03:11.53]You guys all know the story, we don't have to see this shit.
[03:14.32]Oh shit, I gotta change the title.
[03:19.68]And guess what, the title can- I know, the title can stay the same.
[03:24.46]A New Generation of Mutants.
[03:26.26]Can I do a Resident Evil 3 demo?
[03:32.60]Resident Evil 3 demo.
[03:36.54]No, I can't.
[03:37.64]It just has to be Resident Evil 3.
[03:48.63]Resident Evil 3.
[03:52.07]How's it going?
[04:03.64]Okay, I'm escaping this.
[04:05.18]This is hard mode, by the way.
[04:09.12]This is my last chance to survive.
[04:11.23]It's my last chance to escape.
[04:13.49]So you're saying this isn't Dino Crisis?
[04:15.03]No, I'm not.
[04:16.39]Oh, I forgot how bad this game looks.
[04:17.83]Alright, I forget.
[04:21.93]Okay, it's just like it's tank controls, right?
[04:25.90]Okay, L2 is map.
[04:28.94]R1 is aim.
[04:30.48]Don't fire any bullets.
[04:31.38]I think it's note circle.
[04:33.60]Square is run.
[04:34.20]It's okay.
[04:38.28]That's supposed to happen.
[04:38.86]That's part of the scripted dialog cutscene here.
[04:40.38]Climb over this.
[04:43.34]Wait, there's an herb right there.
[04:44.60]Doesn't matter.
[04:49.14]Run to the shop, right?
[04:49.97]Turn right around.
[04:59.52]It's kind of dark.
[05:00.02]It's okay.
[05:03.34]I want to take control.
[05:03.94]I believe I take a... Yeah, I go straight through here.
[05:06.53]We see Brad.
[05:07.29]The helicopter Brad.
[05:08.15]I remain.
[05:09.75]This is a classic.
[05:11.13]You're right.
[05:27.55]Wait, is this the guy that goes, who are you?
[05:29.70]And what are you doing here?
[05:32.54]No, that's Resident Evil 2.
[05:34.22]The demo's probably only ten minutes.
[05:35.94]You might want to slow down.
[05:37.78]No!
[05:57.56]I'd rather starve to death in here than be eaten by one of those undead monsters!
[06:02.50]Now leave me alone!
[06:03.72]I feel like I'd recognize this actor.
[06:04.84]I don't know why.
[06:14.39]Don't you open this up eventually and he's in there?
[06:16.03]I told you!
[06:19.79]I'm not leaving!
[06:21.37]Never!
[06:22.29]Alright, so he just went in there and he's on a stage now in front of an audience.
[06:26.43]He's doing like stand-up
[06:30.42]That was very much, I'm recording audio inside of a club while a comedian is playing.
[06:35.27]Okay, let's go.
[06:43.61]Oh god, tank controls.
[06:45.75]What do we got?
[06:46.76]Activate.
[06:48.06]Take the handgun bullets.
[06:48.94]Yes, I'll take the- Oh, I will take the H. Scott bullets, please.
[06:58.68]You thought I was playing Monster Rancher 3?
[07:00.52]Well, now we're playing Monster Evil 3.
[07:06.88]Slow down.
[07:07.44]Basement exit.
[07:08.38]It's locked.
[07:08.82]Okay.
[07:14.59]That's so awful at tank control.
[07:17.11]No wonder I had to watch my friend play this.
[07:24.27]Into the office.
[07:33.00]That's the key.
[07:35.78]Will you take the warehouse key?
[07:37.07]Yup.
[07:40.77]There's a bunch of random shithole.
[07:41.85]Here's the save point, right?
[07:42.93]There's the chest.
[07:43.93]What's in the chest?
[07:45.51]Usually there's a cool weapon.
[07:50.46]Take the knife.
[07:50.96]You guys think I'm not gonna take this at least somewhat seriously.
[07:55.74]Game insta-V.
[07:58.32]What does that mean?
[07:59.68]Reloading tool.
[08:01.18]Game in... A. No, this is like the game manual.
[08:05.64]Get this out of here.
[08:07.93]That's the in-game manual.
[08:15.37]I know how to play Resident Evil.
[08:22.78]The delivery... I can't even say that word.
[08:24.96]Too many V's.
[08:27.50]I got the key.
[08:28.16]That's all I needed.
[08:28.68]There's shit in here, though.
[08:30.40]What's in there?
[08:31.46]Bags?
[08:34.81]Delivery voucher.
[08:35.63]Those things are... Yeah.
[08:36.47]You don't think I can see these?
[08:37.87]Gunpowder.
[08:38.91]Bingo.
[08:41.21]Combine these together.
[08:48.17]See?
[08:48.51]Gunpowder.
[08:49.13]Double A batteries.
[08:50.73]That's how you make batteries, guys.
[08:55.64]Let's open the door.
[09:06.33]Use gun on zombie.
[09:10.67]I really do wonder how long this demo is.
[09:12.99]This is back in the day with PlayStation 1 demos.
[09:14.93]This really is probably the equivalent of standing at a GameStop 20 years ago when you got to sit in front of the machine.
[09:23.20]They always had the console there.
[09:25.08]And it was like four minutes.
[09:27.74]There's nothing left here.
[09:32.53]There used to be a line for that shit.
[09:34.79]Remember that?
[09:38.19]Get up the stairs, come on.
[09:44.69]I'll get there.
[09:45.67]I'll get there eventually.
[09:56.86]Okay, I gotta be careful here.
[09:59.12]Go.
[10:09.72]Someone would stand too close to you.
[10:13.91]We have to kill at least one zombie.
[10:15.09]This is on hard mode, guys.
[10:16.35]This is not just on easy mode.
[10:21.11]I selected hard mode.
[10:43.39]That scared the shit out of me.
[10:45.01]I'm not even kidding.
[10:46.55]That fucking hurt.
[10:51.56]I forgot this is a horror game.
[10:54.54]An old one.
[11:03.81]I'm just sprinting around, running around, trying to get to the end of the demo.
[11:09.07]I can't even see.
[11:10.69]Can anybody else see what the hell is going on right now?
[11:21.02]Okay, almost.
[11:23.51]Avoid them.
[11:24.09]Never shoot the zombies.
[11:25.15]Always avoid them.
[11:27.95]Locked from the other side.
[11:28.71]Alright, we're gonna break in.
[11:37.94]Fight going on in here.
[11:38.56]Door to the boutique is locked.
[11:39.62]This is where Brad is, right?
[11:48.42]Come on.
[11:49.34]Ready?
[11:50.96]God damn it.
[11:51.53]I fucked it up.
[12:00.43]Is this a vegan run?
[12:03.92]Why do you say that?
[12:10.66]Here we go.
[12:12.34]Come here.
[12:13.68]I have to like touch him, right?
[12:15.30]It's like the rabbit in Mario 64.
[12:16.53]You have to grab him.
[12:22.78]Turn on facecam.
[12:26.32]Okay, here we go.
[12:30.77]That's way too big.
[12:34.29]Now this is, uh, Ronson, right?
[12:50.30]What's his name?
[12:52.57]Brad, hang on.
[12:54.39]Why isn't someone doing something about this?
[12:57.61]I didn't know you were still alive, Jill.
[13:00.13]The police aren't trained for this kind of situation.
[13:02.78]What could they do?
[13:05.38]Listen, he's coming for us.
[13:08.04]We're both gonna die.
[13:10.98]What are you saying?
[13:12.64]You'll see.
[13:17.32]He's after S.T.A.R.S.
[13:18.18]members.
[13:18.78]There's no escape.
[13:22.21]Bronson Swanson.
[13:24.75]Alright, there we go.
[13:26.47]Almost at the end of the demo, probably.
[13:30.11]Uh, payphone.
[13:30.61]Give me the shiny thing.
[13:35.74]Take the lighter.
[13:36.46]Yes, I'm gonna burn a painting like every other Resident Evil video game.
[13:40.28]Light a painting on fire.
[13:42.62]Take the thing that falls out of the painting.
[13:44.40]It's a stone you put into a little kiosk that opens.
[13:47.38]You need three of them that open the door.
[13:49.90]It's been like this for 30 years.
[14:00.31]Take the handgun bullets.
[14:01.81]Yes, I will.
[14:02.83]How do you reload?
[14:06.55]That's not how you reload.
[14:09.51]What is reload?
[14:10.07]I have to do it manually.
[14:12.95]Yes, you have to do it manually, don't you?
[14:16.18]This ain't like your Resident Evil games you've played before.
[14:19.82]This is an old one.
[14:20.98]You gotta do it by yourself.
[14:22.52]On your own.
[14:23.62]No AI is gonna do it for you.
[14:32.13]Okay, here we go.
[14:38.83]Square hole.
[14:43.01]Garbage is scattered around.
[14:44.03]Let's take a left here.
[14:56.09]I have no idea where the fuck I'm going.
[14:57.41]I think you actually do have to go back around, right?
[15:04.21]From what I remember, you get caught by Nemesis, right?
[15:07.19]Didn't go up here, did I?
[15:14.85]Uh-huh.
[15:24.13]Nice reactions.
[15:26.11]Oh, right.
[15:26.70]Sorry.
[15:27.98]Sorry about that, guys.
[15:29.66]Um...
[15:31.92]There we go.
[15:36.90]Okay.
[15:37.68]Combine these.
[15:41.38]Oh, you're looking for crazy reactions.
[15:46.09]I'll take care of that.
[15:46.79]Just give me a second.
[15:49.89]Just wait.
[15:55.23]Double it up.
[15:59.94]Okay.
[16:03.60]I'm just playing Resident Evil 3 now.
[16:07.36]I'm, like, kind of okay with this.
[16:12.27]Can't somebody beat this game in, like, 32 minutes or something?
[16:17.35]I can't even see.
[16:18.05]How do I get... This is it?
[16:19.17]Can I go in this window?
[16:19.89]I don't think this does anything.
[16:29.22]I'm observant?
[16:29.88]I mean, I'm pretty observant.
[16:31.06]Depends.
[16:34.62]We weren't playing this before?
[16:35.62]No.
[16:37.50]Oh, great.
[16:37.90]That's fine.
[16:39.72]Um... Oh, I forgot they sneeze on you.
[16:43.98]If you get hit with a sneeze, it takes like 10% damage down.
[16:48.19]Uh... Get out of the fucking way!
[17:17.37]World record is 42 minutes.
[17:19.03]Jesus, my god.
[17:20.15]I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[17:27.21]Shutter is down.
[17:27.93]I need to open a map up.
[17:34.06]Roughly one hour for the speedrun?
[17:35.38]I'm almost one hour for the demo.
[17:37.32]I got it.
[17:37.66]Where have we not gone?
[17:41.88]I don't even fucking know.
[17:45.58]I'm going all the way back.
[17:50.62]Yes, I'm gonna play the remastered Dark Souls, absolutely.
[17:53.52]In full.
[17:58.86]We gotta go back.
[18:07.37]We gotta go like all the way back.
[18:14.17]I'm just like running into people now.
[18:20.35]In full 720 HD?
[18:23.05]I'm gonna play the absolute hell out of that.
[18:25.73]It's gonna be fun.
[18:35.07]Was there another door in here?
[18:36.15]Probably wasn't, I'm just stupid.
[18:48.62]I'm gonna get addicted to that game.
[18:51.70]Die.
[18:52.16]Good time for this shit.
[19:04.91]There is another door here, but didn't I come through this one?
[19:09.81]Or am I crazy and I didn't?
[19:13.60]Yeah, it'll be my first time actually beating the game.
[19:16.10]Okay, so that just opened this door.
[19:18.12]That's all that did.
[20:32.01]Wait, wait!
[20:32.67]No.
[20:32.93]Shit!
[21:01.89]Why?
[21:02.25]I tried.
[21:12.96]No, no joke.
[21:13.58]I just had this thought that I probably put the Dino Crisis CD in a different PlayStation 1 disk holder.
[21:27.22]Apparently I didn't.
[21:28.94]Wait a minute.
[21:31.07]Okay, pray, everybody.
[21:32.41]Everybody say a fucking prayer, because look.
[21:35.01]This is time crisis.
[21:37.11]And as you can see, it's moving around a little.
[21:39.88]What's underneath time crisis?
[21:40.98]What's underneath time crisis?
[21:46.44]Another time crisis.
[21:49.60]God fucking damn it, man.
[21:51.90]Why was I that smart to do that?
[22:07.69]Last ditch effort, and then I'm done.
[22:09.59]And that's it.
[22:13.01]What's this?
[22:17.06]Here we go.
