[ve:61.7.100]

[00:01.19]So I wasn't going to start streaming for like another couple of minutes, but I just, my brain went into autopilot and I tweeted that the stream was live.
[00:10.99]And then I went, oh, fuck.
[00:12.05]Oh, oh, oh.
[00:12.69]And I just pressed live.
[00:15.47]I wasn't planning on it.
[00:16.57]I just did it early.
[00:17.31]I did the tweet first.
[00:21.12]And look, I know, I know, Gerber, just link your Twitter to Twitch and it'll just do a tweet.
[00:27.88]I don't want the robots taking over my accounts.
[00:30.42]Sorry.
[00:35.60]I don't want any... I don't want any... Then it, like, goes into your Twitter.
[00:40.38]And it, like, reads your tweets.
[00:43.22]And sends them... To Bezos!
[00:46.05]Where do you think they go?
[00:46.79]Where do you think his toilet reading material is?
[00:56.94]Anyways.
[01:02.24]The app is not letting me see the screen.
[01:05.12]My tweets.
[01:07.42]Yeah, just mine.
[01:08.38]Anyways, we're going to play... Hey, first of all, hi.
[01:13.72]Welcome.
[01:15.18]We're going to play Bushido Blade.
[01:17.82]I think I'm saying that right.
[01:20.60]Bushido Blade and maybe Bushido Blade 2.
[01:23.54]It depends on if I can even get past the second enemy in this game.
[01:29.64]This is a classic.
[01:30.50]This is an old favorite of a lot of people.
[01:34.58]This game is different from some of the other games you may have played.
[01:39.14]At least, it's kind of a fighting game, but it's different.
[01:42.96]Because if you get hit once, you die.
[01:45.91]And if you hit somebody else, they die.
[01:49.05]In one hit.
[01:51.21]Typically.
[01:55.05]So.
[01:56.95]With that in mind...
[01:59.60]Is this the first or second one?
[02:00.50]This is the first one, but I also have the second one right next to me.
[02:05.64]And I know I've been told, because I played this game when I was 12 or something, or 13.
[02:11.55]I just didn't get it, and I hated it.
[02:15.85]I think I rented it, and I was like, this game sucks.
[02:17.87]This is stupid.
[02:18.64]I don't like this, because you just die in one hit.
[02:21.86]I had no idea what was going on.
[02:25.85]But now, as an adult, I understand what's going on.
[02:31.49]So, I'll be ready.
[02:33.61]But, to jump on the thing I was just saying.
[02:36.79]This game, the second one is apparently just a better version of the first game.
[02:42.61]But I got them both.
[02:44.38]That's what I've been told.
[02:46.40]Anyways, welcome.
[02:48.34]Hope everyone's having a good day.
[02:51.06]I'm still trying to figure out, so... As of tomorrow...
[02:56.77]I'm probably gonna do... I don't know.
[02:59.96]I have to get ready to leave.
[03:02.16]I have to leave.
[03:04.06]If you weren't here last night, the Halloween stream is not happening in Vegas.
[03:07.50]I'm going on location for that special stream.
[03:12.07]Should be a lot of fun.
[03:14.07]So, if there is a stream tomorrow, it's gonna be short.
[03:18.79]Like, probably less than a few hours.
[03:22.23]Oh, you just nailed it right there.
[03:23.51]That one guy.
[03:24.71]Jackbox.
[03:25.69]Done.
[03:27.01]Jackbox tomorrow for like two or three hours.
[03:29.27]Four hours.
[03:30.67]Done.
[03:31.07]Easy.
[03:32.05]Perfect.
[03:32.95]That shit just came out.
[03:33.85]Yeah.
[03:36.65]Yes, I did it.
[03:39.44]Anyways, here we go.
[03:41.00]Classic video games.
[03:42.94]Bushido Blade.
[03:45.78]I'm ready to attempt.
[03:51.26]Here we go.
[03:53.10]There are other modes in this game, but I don't... I mean... I'm just saying, just baptism by far.
[03:59.84]What do you think?
[04:00.24]I'm just gonna go.
[04:05.18]POV mode?
[04:06.18]Well, we have to do the POV mode after I figure out what the hell I'm doing.
[04:09.91]Okay, so... Shadow... Let's see... Let's see...
[04:21.13]Alright, I think I'm going to be this guy.
[04:28.83]What weapon do I want to use?
[04:29.90]Katana.
[04:32.00]I don't even know what any of these are.
[04:39.58]Is it?
[04:40.08]Okay, wait.
[04:40.50]Broadsword.
[04:41.08]That sounds pretty good.
[04:44.14]Broadsword?
[04:45.48]Minecraft sword.
[04:46.70]Yeah.
[04:47.70]Hammer?
[04:51.38]Okay, I'll do the hammer.
[04:54.35]Is this the fucking hardest thing to use?
[04:55.93]That's not even- what is this thing?
[04:57.23]It's a sword.
[04:57.79]I'm holding it by the blade.
[04:58.79]There's no subtitles.
[05:06.01]Face engine.
[05:12.74]Everyone who knew that was sworn to secrecy and not allowed to leave the compound One person broke the code of silence and escaped Into the ruins of a deserted castle in search of the only way out through the castle tower I should have picked the broadsword
[05:41.68]Oh, and we actually do get subtitled.
[05:43.96]Okay.
[05:44.40]It's time for me... It's kind of like a fighting game, but it's not really a fighting game, but it is.
[05:49.70]It just is.
[05:51.42]Alright, here we go.
[05:53.16]How do you play?
[06:11.90]Wait, he got hit.
[06:12.50]You mirror him.
[06:13.26]I didn't hit him?
[06:17.72]Dude, the hammer sucks.
[06:22.07]Alright, hit him in the head.
[06:28.05]Got him.
[06:30.99]Alright, I did it.
[06:32.35]I got him in the head like three times.
[06:33.69]This is supposed to be a one-hit kill.
[06:37.60]What am I doing?
[06:45.40]You crushed his face in.
[06:50.38]Oh shit, okay, round two.
[06:54.00]Fight!
[06:55.56]Okay, so circle looks like a... You have a blade.
[06:59.56]This is not even a sledgehammer, this is a stick.
[07:02.50]With two bells on it.
[07:05.88]She hit me with the flat end.
[07:08.98]Oh, she hit me with the flat end, I'm fine.
[07:11.19]Oh shit!
[07:18.04]Oh my god.
[07:19.42]That's pretty brutal, actually.
[07:21.24]Sledgehammer is actually pretty good.
[07:30.45]So is it still level one?
[07:34.85]It's a Warhammer.
[07:35.75]Aren't Warhammers shorter?
[07:37.11]Alright, no message.
[07:42.90]No, no, don't do it.
[07:44.52]I'm bleeding out of the leg.
[07:48.56]Oh god.
[07:50.42]Oh god, please.
[07:52.02]Don't do it.
[07:55.36]Head.
[07:55.60]Hit it in the head.
[08:03.06]Come on, I just gotta crush head.
[08:05.96]Okay, L1 is run.
[08:11.08]Alright, I'm gonna do a running circle.
[08:14.37]Oh, I would've had it.
[08:19.82]No!
[08:21.93]I'm not a coward, I'm just being tactical.
[08:28.59]Oh, dammit!
[08:29.87]Why am I not dying?
[08:31.21]What, what are they... are they using practice swords?
[08:35.63]I'm dead.
[08:38.63]Ugh...
[08:49.06]Continue.
[08:52.40]Easy mode.
[08:53.00]No, this is not hard.
[08:53.93]Okay.
[08:55.61]Is there a block?
[08:56.67]Triangle is like a quick one.
[08:59.63]Okay, square is a little parry.
[09:05.41]Alright, I get it.
[09:08.53]Alright, yeah, square is like a... Yeah, I got you.
[09:28.16]Look at both my legs.
[09:32.48]I got really banged up legs.
[09:40.71]Yeah, one hit weapon master.
[09:42.25]Alright, here we go.
[09:46.67]I gotta get a good parry.
[09:53.65]Oop, you can hit stuff.
[09:55.39]Oh!
[09:58.81]I tried to run.
[09:59.37]That was... If you did that in a real fight, that would be really embarrassing.
[10:08.38]Do I just keep all my scars?
[10:10.96]Yeah, I just... I'm like... I don't think I can use my... I can't use my left arm.
[10:15.71]I'm blocking.
[10:17.11]I'm blocking.
[10:20.53]I'm blocking.
[10:29.28]What?
[10:29.75]He killed me.
[10:30.37]Yeah, he did.
[10:31.23]Damn it.
[10:40.11]How many continues do I get?
[10:41.69]Okay, this is like the hard boss.
[10:43.41]I'm trying to give him a chance.
[10:46.89]Get out of here.
[10:48.57]Got him.
[11:02.17]No honor?
[11:02.73]Yeah, I know.
[11:03.21]That's the equivalent of, like, punching the guy before the bell, but whatever.
[11:07.59]Now what?
[11:08.95]Where am I going?
[11:23.54]I'm not controlling this.
[11:26.66]What?
[11:28.10]Alright, we're going down to the sewer.
[11:35.28]Let's have a clean fight.
[11:37.64]Sure.
[11:39.02]Got him.
[11:45.63]Double tapped him.
[11:46.27]Get out of my way.
[11:50.87]By the way, you might not be noticing the nuance there.
[11:53.59]That was a parry block into a double tap.
[11:59.64]I guess that this weapon sucks.
[12:05.03]Seek to save your life and lose it.
[12:06.53]Through death one finds the way of Narukagami.
[12:11.91]Did I win?
[12:24.34]I win.
[12:32.69]I remember this game.
[12:33.57]Why was this game so hard when I was younger?
[12:35.71]I don't think I beat the first person.
[12:44.56]Alright, new character.
[12:51.24]Piovimo.
[12:57.71]I have to play honorably.
[12:58.77]Okay, fine.
[12:59.97]I do want to use... I want to use... Let me use just, like, a small thing, like this thing.
[13:03.54]Actually, I have to, but this is going to be hard.
[13:06.34]Alright, you can use the... It's a long story.
[13:09.58]That's fine.
[13:11.44]How much did I pay for this?
[13:13.86]Um, I don't think it was very much.
[13:16.10]It's an arena.
[13:20.63]Be honorable.
[13:21.73]Stop killing.
[13:23.21]You have to kill...
[13:28.65]Holy shit, are you kidding me?
[13:33.50]This is actually pretty cool.
[13:41.12]I can't even... Oh, I have to block.
[13:42.52]Get up!
[13:43.42]Did I lose?
[13:44.38]I'm dead.
[13:51.04]It's different in VR.
[13:52.64]It's harder in VR.
[14:00.24]Alright, I'll get him here.
[14:06.00]Got him.
[14:08.24]No, wait, it's a short sword, right?
[14:10.74]What?
[14:11.24]Got him.
[14:19.89]He fell down.
[14:20.65]I was cutting a hole through his head.
[14:27.43]This looks like a Roblox game.
[14:31.24]Why am I continuing for you?
[14:34.00]What?
[14:34.24]This is like a flip.
[14:42.09]Got him.
[14:43.93]Win instantly.
[14:45.23]Wait, he's... I gotta see that in slow motion.
[14:47.99]Or replay.
[14:48.91]Watch this.
[14:50.89]Bang.
[14:52.98]Nice try.
[14:56.40]Go back to story mode and play honorably.
[14:59.61]Well, I need to not continue for the computer.
[15:04.01]Alright, fine.
[15:04.61]I'm gonna do... Maybe the Sledgehammer was easy mode.
[15:13.88]What's the hard weapon?
[15:23.58]Fists.
[15:25.00]Like, you can't use fists.
[15:30.85]No weapon.
[15:31.83]Fist.
[15:32.27]I can't select zero weapon.
[15:33.98]How about just, um... How about just long sword?
[15:41.98]Or kitana.
[15:45.95]None.
[15:47.05]I... None means I eject a disk from the tray.
[15:53.65]Google how to be honorable.
[15:55.13]What?
[15:55.39]Are you guys making this up?
[16:01.72]Hold on a minute.
[16:02.20]This is real?
[16:12.47]Hold on.
[16:12.77]Did I just, like, go through and just kill everybody?
[16:15.03]And I wasn't supposed to do that.
[16:22.68]Oh.
[16:24.26]I just... I don't know.
[16:26.08]It is real.
[16:28.58]Okay, hold on.
[16:30.09]Fight with honor.
[16:31.13]Bushido Blade was a 3D fighting game featuring one-on-one honor combat.
[16:34.30]Unlike other fighting games, there were no health bars.
[16:37.42]Players had to play this game with intelligence and not mash buttons.
[16:40.56]A high-skilled player could pull off an instant kill while not batting an eye, and those kills satisfied me after mastering the combat mechanics, okay?
[16:48.34]Don't be careless.
[16:49.95]How do I fight honorably?
[16:51.25]Honor the code.
[16:52.49]The one mechanic that helps this game stand out from the other fighting games was the Bushido code.
[16:56.77]The game considers certain moves and tactics dishonorable.
[17:00.40]Don't strike opponents in the back.
[17:02.44]Don't throw dust at people.
[17:04.10]Don't strike opponents while they're lying down or attack opponents before the start of the fight.
[17:08.92]Which I did every time.
[17:12.10]If any of these dishonorable acts take place, the story will end in the middle of the playthrough.
[17:17.36]The screen will display a message and berate the player for his cowardly act.
[17:22.90]What?
[17:28.68]So what can I not do?
[17:30.77]No stabbing in the back.
[17:33.38]Don't throw dust and don't fu- I don't want to tackle the- Alright.
[17:37.54]I got it.
[17:37.88]Let's go.
[17:41.92]Don't hit them while they're down.
[17:43.57]Am I trying to win?
[17:44.81]Or am I trying- What am I trying to do here?
[17:48.63]The Meikyokan Dojo of the Narukagumi Shinto School is really a secret society of assassins called Kage.
[17:58.06]Everyone who knew that was sworn to secrecy and not allowed to leave the compound.
[18:05.01]The honorable.
[18:05.65]But one person broke the code of silence and escaped.
[18:08.45]Is stabbing in the back a win?
[18:10.19]Into the ruins of a deserted castle in search of the only way out to the castle tower.
[18:18.24]One hit is actually, like, dishonorable.
[18:20.48]Maybe this is why I didn't understand it.
[18:22.24]I still don't understand it as an adult.
[18:25.62]I returned this game to blockbuster.
[18:27.08]Okay, so I'm just gonna stand if somebody falls down.
[18:35.59]But what if they trip?
[18:37.41]That's your fault.
[18:40.27]I didn't know there was a dust throw button in the game.
[18:42.99]I'm probably gonna accidentally do it and ruin the playthrough.
[18:47.99]I don't even know the moveset for this thing.
[18:49.47]I should have done a hammer.
[18:50.51]Alright, here we go.
[18:52.89]Alright, don't attack.
[18:53.99]We're... Okay.
[18:54.63]We're ready.
[18:56.91]Get out of here.
[19:17.79]Come on, I can't... I can't just run in there and stab.
[19:22.18]It's not so easy now, is it?
[19:24.10]Oh, come on.
[19:25.60]I'll get this.
[19:26.70]That was a pretty sick move.
[19:33.27]Is that dishonorable?
[19:34.95]Are you doing a backflip?
[19:35.93]That's like showing off.
[19:37.89]Got him.
[19:45.22]God, what?
[19:51.11]You did a backflip and I did a backflip and then you slit my throat.
[19:59.70]Can't win with honor.
[20:00.82]Yes, I can.
[20:01.40]Shit, kill me.
[20:02.98]Kill me.
[20:03.28]I didn't mean to do that.
[20:04.45]Kill me.
[20:15.03]Okay.
[20:16.49]You need to kill everyone without dying.
[20:20.63]That's not going to happen.
[20:21.55]Okay, here we go.
[20:25.45]I don't like this weapon.
[20:28.85]Give me a fucking break.
[20:31.66]This weapon sucks.
[20:32.64]I need my hammer back.
[20:37.40]This is probably the weapon I picked when I was 12.
[20:39.78]And I was like, this is stupid.
[20:51.35]Can't play without the e- My inputs didn't- I'm not even gonna- I cannot- I'm not gonna make a complaint about inputs.
[20:55.73]Nope.
[20:56.37]That's an automatic you suck moment.
[21:00.20]My inputs won't even- Oh, you said the word inputs.
[21:02.80]Uh, automatic I don't listen to the next three words.
[21:06.10]Got it.
[21:12.84]How come that wasn't an instant kill, but yours is?
[21:18.86]Input equals dishonorable.
[21:21.96]I don't like this move set either.
[21:26.50]One... What?
[21:29.82]Somehow I died.
[21:30.58]I don't know.
[21:31.48]Somehow I think I killed myself with the sword.
[21:33.38]How?
[21:35.96]What?
[21:36.98]Fuck.
[21:38.03]I can't do it.
[21:38.71]Honorable.
[21:39.63]No, I can't do it with this weapon.
[21:41.67]This weapon sucks.
[21:55.35]Come on, that's not gonna kill... Easy.
[22:00.16]Is running dishonorable?
[22:01.38]I didn't run technically.
[22:03.60]How would... I'd stab you in the fucking face!
[22:07.48]Don't stab me in the back.
[22:13.38]Dishonorable.
[22:18.37]That was in the back.
[22:19.39]Okay, I hit you three times.
[22:20.69]That was in the back.
[22:27.77]Alright, I hit her three times with the same sword that she's using, and I died with one hit.
[22:33.85]What kind of bullshit, dishonorable bullshit is that?
[22:37.71]Get out of here.
[22:42.64]What did I do?
[22:47.50]That was insurmountable, right?
[22:51.22]Just use a different weapon.
[22:52.27]Yeah, but I've already beat the first boss.
[23:04.27]A skilled opponent can insta-kill without that you pay attention.
[23:08.65]The title of my stream is you can get hit in this game.
[23:11.80]What?
[23:22.17]I tried to do the backflip.
[23:25.77]No, it's not hammer time.
[23:28.11]Actually, I want to do the training.
[23:33.43]Okay, R1 is a different stance.
[23:37.69]I actually like this stance.
[23:40.11]Nice block.
[23:45.31]Got it.
[23:54.77]I got right into the intestines.
[23:59.87]That's an dishonorable stance.
[24:02.15]There's no such thing.
[24:14.38]I like that stance.
[24:15.20]Okay, here we go.
[24:18.60]You're not gonna get anywhere just by baseball-swinging.
[24:24.65]I got a little, I got a little scab there.
[24:30.05]Bang.
[24:35.49]I didn't even, I didn't need to try.
[24:41.81]That was really easy.
[24:50.21]I don't vibe as shit.
[24:51.85]Don't- is he gonna make that- you gonna make that thing now?
[24:58.14]Okay.
[24:59.86]Change stance.
[25:06.13]The block- What hap- What happens now?
[25:18.49]Is it like a race?
[25:19.35]Who hit the ground first?
[25:20.41]Oh, come on.
[25:21.69]Hina?
[25:26.85]No, kill me.
[25:28.21]I didn't even swing.
[25:28.97]You're hitting me when I'm on the ground.
[25:33.28]Holy shit!
[25:34.88]That was really desirable.
[25:39.28]Oh my god.
[25:41.92]That's like dialed to 11.
[25:48.10]I thought you said not to hit people on the ground.
[25:49.74]What do you mean you can do that?
[25:51.14]How do you care?
[25:57.12]Oh shit.
[26:00.85]What came out of me?
[26:05.07]How did I drop?
[26:08.27]Did I drop, like, loot?
[26:20.84]Okay.
[26:22.92]I've been honorable so far.
[26:26.18]We're gonna jump down in the sewer.
[26:30.22]Taking the long way.
[26:31.04]Gonna just jump in.
[26:38.02]This is the sewer of honor.
[26:39.96]Okay.
[26:41.86]Okay.
[26:45.22]Oh, shit.
[26:46.58]Let me get out.
[26:48.32]Oh, where's the honor?
[26:50.60]My legs are broken.
[26:53.48]Is this honourable?
[27:04.71]Is this... step on his fingers!
[27:07.73]Shit!
[27:08.81]Get up!
[27:09.07]Oh!
[27:09.27]Just honourable!
[27:20.41]Punk!
[27:23.47]Shit.
[27:24.93]No, get away from me.
[27:28.11]No, let me get up.
[27:28.91]There's no honor in what you're doing.
[27:32.09]Get away from me.
[27:41.60]Get away.
[27:47.60]This is... This is not even...
[27:57.79]Just sick of my shit at that point.
[27:59.39]Alright, I think I did some dishonorable things, so I'm gonna start.
[28:06.01]Prepare!
[28:06.59]I'm prepared.
[28:07.15]To end this.
[28:11.61]He's wearing body armor.
[28:12.77]Gotta get him in the head.
[28:15.05]How much health?
[28:16.23]What the fuck?
[28:17.55]Oh!
[28:18.43]Should I not have done that?
[28:19.31]If you stab when they're dead?
[28:20.75]Is that alright?
[28:28.67]Is that okay?
[28:30.01]I really hope that's not a problem.
[28:34.17]There's a gun!
[28:34.71]Wait!
[28:53.86]Wha- a- you- a gun?
[28:56.68]Why do you have a gun?
[29:04.77]Play honorably.
[29:06.19]Shoot gun at somebody.
[29:08.57]Are you kidding me?
[29:09.45]Can I like, block it like a Jedi?
[29:10.75]I'm not gonna be- what?
[29:33.89]God damn it!
[29:34.55]I was trying to... I thought he... He froze.
[29:43.51]I was just, God, get the fuck out of here.
[29:51.76]I can't block the bullets.
[29:53.22]Is it dishonorable if I... I don't know... I can't attack him before he gets his text out.
[29:59.04]I can't attack before he gets his text out, and I can't move.
[30:01.71]Damn it!
[30:02.21]No!
[30:02.39]I wanna play as the guy with the gun.
[30:05.63]Do you unlock him?
[30:11.17]Slide in fast kill with my freight, sure.
[30:28.21]Um... I just... I know I listened to somebody in the chat, but... Running at the guy with the gun.
[30:40.96]See you later.
[30:41.70]Okay, does the next person have an assault rifle or something?
[30:56.68]You fight a tank.
[30:57.16]Now that would be funny.
[31:01.52]Okay.
[31:18.98]Alright, easy.
[31:20.16]He has the Darth Maul thing.
[31:22.00]I don't know what they're called.
[31:24.07]Yes, I know.
[31:24.69]It's called actually something, but I just know it by Darth Maul.
[31:29.03]God damn it.
[31:44.61]It's too long.
[31:45.83]It's too long.
[31:46.87]Jesus.
[31:51.16]Get over here.
[31:52.76]Oh no!
[31:53.22]Don't!
[31:53.86]Don't, Adam!
[31:54.84]Shit!
[32:01.97]No!
[32:02.75]Shit!
[32:04.59]That's how you... I don't know.
[32:05.57]That's how you did that.
[32:06.71]Well, well.
[32:11.38]I didn't expect that.
[32:17.40]I tried for it.
[32:17.82]I went for it.
[32:19.02]Not in the back.
[32:20.10]Not in the back.
[32:21.14]Block this.
[32:22.40]God damn it.
[32:28.68]Go in the water?
[32:30.49]That's not a bad idea.
[32:31.85]Alright, I need to... He got a little caught.
[32:34.11]That might be his downfall.
[32:58.63]Who's after this guy?
[33:00.65]Alright, I'll get it now.
[33:03.59]Here we go.
[33:04.81]I had it.
[33:06.15]I had it.
[33:10.23]Block it.
[33:10.73]Oh, block it.
[33:14.47]Block it.
[33:18.19]Come on, win that combo.
[33:21.96]Whoa!
[33:22.60]What was that?
[33:25.18]Damn it!
[33:26.37]Don't walk there!
[33:31.27]Sidestep the lens?
[33:32.27]I was trying for it right there.
[33:38.81]Now that I...
[33:53.67]God!
[33:55.57]Alright, now that I've had some time to see different weapons in action, and this is an accurate accurate, the lance is the best weapon that's ever been invented for hand-to-hand combat.
[34:09.06]You can just stand like 10 feet away.
[34:11.76]Isn't that great, isn't it?
[34:12.62]Isn't it like the best weapon ever?
[34:20.11]Got it.
[34:21.47]He's not... I thought he wasn't dead.
[34:25.22]He was doing what I was doing.
[34:26.18]He was making jokes out of this whole thing.
[34:33.04]Running around in circles.
[34:37.10]Where did I go?
[34:39.25]Did I... I just jumped out of frame?
[34:41.57]I don't know.
[34:51.69]Oh shit, that was actually pretty bad.
[34:53.43]That was scary.
[34:55.31]Fucking spammer.
[35:00.55]Here we go.
[35:18.65]Oh, shit!
[35:19.25]Damn it!
[35:23.15]Now I've switched.
[35:25.55]That's the Burgah Boy technique.
[35:35.68]It's not a bad technique.
[35:38.30]Oh, don't... I was trying not to stab you in the back.
[35:49.48]Because that's dishonorable.
[35:52.23]Lifted up her left arm to dodge that somehow.
[35:59.99]I'm going to go for a dab.
[36:04.89]Holy shit.
[36:05.97]Once they get cocky, that's when you can win.
[36:20.75]Try to go for the... I'm gonna try to go for the other side.
[36:23.67]Right here.
[36:23.93]Shit.
[36:24.13]This is... We're getting into this, though.
[36:31.89]Counterattack.
[36:34.66]Yeah, well, after you block, you can't do anything for a second or so.
[36:58.27]Okay, you get like a spin super move?
[37:03.71]Where did you get that from?
[37:05.53]I don't have one of those?
[37:09.91]Helicopter attack?
[37:11.93]Zangief, yeah.
[37:29.99]This is not my kind of play.
[37:31.03]It's like you're giving me a weapon.
[37:34.93]I'll try.
[37:35.41]I'm not changing stances.
[37:41.00]I feel like that's bad right now.
[37:48.22]Can you skip the replays?
[37:49.24]I can, but don't you guys want to see?
[37:52.28]Yeah, I want to learn some actual techniques.
[37:55.34]Let's see if I can complete the game without knowing anything.
[38:00.28]Why is your sword sharper than mine?
[38:05.15]Are the directional inputs?
[38:09.53]Probably.
[38:09.99]Because it looks like... Hold on, let me see.
[38:12.59]If I go down and, like, forward and... Well... I wasn't even looking at the screen.
[38:24.08]I was looking at my controller.
[38:25.46]Okay.
[38:31.22]I was like, wait, Dao didn't... That's the secret.
[38:32.78]I thought it just ran and just slashed.
[38:34.46]Brightness, die!
[39:06.18]He was like, please, please poke my stomach.
[39:12.45]I did it.
[39:12.81]Full motion video cutscene.
[39:14.71]Satsujin Mashin.
[39:32.77]Wait, what are you talking about?
[39:35.53]I have nowhere to go.
[40:06.11]Alright.
[40:06.53]Face reveal.
[40:06.99]Alright, do I get... the... Can I use the Gakugan?
[40:38.00]I had to have unlocked it, right?
[40:44.91]That's bad ending.
[40:46.43]To get the good ending, you have to not die once.
[40:49.05]Throw out the whole thing.
[40:52.07]Well.
[40:53.77]Um.
[40:55.69]That's not gonna happen.
[40:59.48]You can get him, but it's hard.
[41:00.78]How do you unlock that?
[41:03.62]I wanna plug the gun.
[41:06.73]We're going to go into training.
[41:08.69]Just curious.
[41:09.73]I need to learn this for the next game.
[41:11.97]And I have to pick a weapon that I care about.
[41:14.92]Also, some maps you have to exit the map in a specific area mid-fight, really.
[41:29.51]Go in quality build, something like that.
[41:37.05]Okay, so let's see.
[41:40.11]So, circle.
[41:41.71]Just like, uh, you can do a double dare.
[41:45.13]What if I go, like, down and, like, okay, what if I go backwards?
[41:50.93]Forward, forward circle, forward circle, forward circle, forward circle.
[41:56.62]Make sure there's a double tap there.
[42:00.14]X has, it's just standard forward and X, down and X, back X, up X, forward X, double tap back X, double tap forward X, double tap forward... I have to beat a hundred enemies in slash mode without dying to unlock the guy with the gun.
[42:22.79]I wonder if, like, you have a triangle, like, circle, like, circle triangle.
[42:32.38]Because that's the block, literally.
[42:37.13]How about just tap, tap.
[42:43.19]I mean, yeah, some of these don't tap, tap.
[42:46.50]Can I do tap, tap?
[42:47.24]Or tap, tap?
[42:49.38]I actually like holding like this.
[42:54.02]The baseball stance, yeah.
[42:57.51]You are really slow.
[43:04.85]I'm trying to do those, like, you guys saying, like, directional in, like, a button.
[43:13.78]Lower stance with R2, I think.
[43:17.88]Oh, shit, yeah, you can do high, mid, and low.
[43:21.08]Damn, okay.
[43:27.79]That's good to know.
[43:35.10]The game is too loud.
[43:37.44]I can't hear you.
[43:38.44]Alright, sorry.
[43:39.46]I didn't know.
[43:41.88]This is the first time music's been in the game.
[43:44.07]Alright, how do I get out of this?
[43:48.55]How do I get out of... Check the game manual?
[43:54.11]Yeah, I would have to go online for that because this did not come with the manual.
[43:57.89]Alright, kill me.
[43:59.09]So I want to go to the slash mode.
[44:05.72]Start, select?
[44:06.34]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[44:08.10]How about... Start, select.
[44:15.79]Select, start.
[44:18.57]Start, select, and shoulder buttons.
[44:25.45]Holy shit, you do have to press everything at the same time.
[44:28.59]Okay.
[44:30.35]Movie.
[44:32.07]What is slash mode?
[44:33.23]Let's see what that does.
[44:41.86]We're gonna go with, uh... We'll go with Mikado.
[44:45.58]We're gonna do... I guess we have to do the katana.
[44:49.39]I guess I can't pick.
[44:52.99]Beat slash mode on hard without continuing.
[44:55.13]Let's see how impossible that is.
[44:58.21]We want cheats.
[44:59.24]We want cheats.
[45:02.04]Hurry up!
[45:09.11]Honor doesn't matter here.
[45:11.61]I just like steamroller.
[45:14.69]Alright, bring this down.
[45:17.81]Bring this sword down.
[45:21.61]There we go.
[45:23.65]Ooh, that's a good... I like that.
[45:26.57]Okay, a hundred of these?
[45:28.83]I mean, they are pretty dumb.
[45:43.68]I actually don't like this weapon.
[45:46.14]But I have to use it.
[45:57.09]No, he's alive!
[45:58.27]Good.
[45:59.17]We're gonna try that technique a hundred times.
[46:08.13]Don't kill me.
[46:12.77]Alright, I broke his arm.
[46:14.25]Good.
[46:14.87]Okay, I think I can do this.
[46:22.74]Holy shit, he missed.
[46:23.76]Thank god.
[46:40.71]No, they get harder.
[46:44.39]Oh boy.
[46:47.56]Good thing I blocked that!
[46:49.92]Oh, I'm dead.
[46:50.44]I got to nine.
[47:05.77]You have to do that a hundred times.
[47:07.29]Holy shit.
[47:09.65]Wow.
[47:10.11]It's just a gauntlet mode.
[47:13.83]And you have to get to a hundred.
[47:15.68]I can imagine getting to 99.
[47:20.02]And hating myself because I've lost.
[47:26.34]Give it one more try.
[47:35.63]We both did the same thing.
[47:44.66]What is honor?
[47:46.16]I don't need honor.
[47:48.78]Although... I'm just helping this guy tumble backwards over and over again.
[47:56.01]How many more times do I have to do this?
[48:12.99]I just did the thing that you do at the arcade when you're really mad that you lost and you don't have any coins left.
[48:16.63]You just get to fucking zero.
[48:18.59]No one else is going to have fun.
[48:19.53]Alright, let me see.
[48:25.42]Bushido blade combos.
[48:31.16]The mauled spam.
[48:34.36]Here we go.
[48:34.74]Here's a move list.
[48:38.18]Okay, so I'm just curious.
[48:41.21]General moves.
[48:43.51]Okay, square.
[48:45.43]Square R2 is roll backwards.
[48:48.42]Forward R2 is kneel, pick up weapon.
[48:52.98]Throw dirt.
[48:53.72]There's a jump.
[48:55.96]Forward R2 and then R1 is jump.
[49:01.90]Hold on.
[49:02.36]You can do this too?
[49:03.44]What happens if you do this?
[49:07.82]Do a 100% dirt throw run.
[49:08.50]Okay.
[49:08.66]Okay.
[49:24.22]Just use cheat codes.
[49:28.90]Can I use the gun guy?
[49:29.88]4.5 kilograms sword.
[49:32.84]Throwing dirt is BM, but it's lots of fun.
[49:34.66]Let me try this.
[49:46.53]And then we'll move on to Bushido Blade 2, because Bushido Blade 2 is just Bushido Blade 1, but better.
[49:50.61]With more stuff.
[49:53.64]The Gunga is only available in two-player mode.
[49:55.46]Oh, shit.
[49:56.00]Well... Uh... Uh-oh, that's not true.
[50:03.51]Is it not true?
[50:05.35]Oh, shit.
[50:06.93]It's literally worse.
[50:08.19]Oh.
[50:10.08]It's worse.
[50:12.66]I think it's worse.
[50:18.76]Don't play too... I already bought it.
[50:21.36]I'm not going to not play it.
[50:22.54]It's... It's right here.
[50:24.44]What do you want me to do?
[50:27.72]Recycle it?
[50:42.29]Okay, let's see.
[50:48.53]So it's... Stop, I'm trying to boost Dishonorable too.
[50:52.45]Forward, R2, R2.
[50:59.81]Forward plus R2 and then R2.
[51:03.84]Let's try it again.
[51:05.90]Oh, there it was.
[51:14.78]Kind of.
[51:15.28]Forward R2.
[51:21.14]Uh, it's not working.
[51:22.14]Forward R2, R2.
[51:23.86]Forward R2, R2.
[51:25.02]Forward R2, R2.
[51:26.78]Forward R2.
[51:27.21]Well, it looks like he kneels down for a second.
[51:33.13]It's not working.
[51:37.89]Forward R2.
[51:40.41]And then R2 is throw dirt.
[51:42.53]Because forward R2 is kneel.
[51:45.61]So when I kneel down, I should... Some moves are weapon dependent.
[51:49.50]Oh, shit.
[51:51.82]This is under general moves.
[51:57.34]Don't hit your opponent when they're lying on the ground.
[52:00.50]No whacking your opponent in the back.
[52:01.84]Don't slice your opponent when they're climbing a wall.
[52:04.28]No beheading your opponent before they are ready.
[52:06.16]What do you mean beheading your opponent before they're ready?
[52:09.54]No blinding your opponent by throwing something at them.
[52:11.50]Dirt and snow, etc.
[52:12.42]Oh, here we go.
[52:14.90]Hit some moves.
[52:22.04]We're looking for the rip here.
[52:23.52]There it is.
[52:24.50]Okay.
[52:25.86]Triangle from high stance.
[52:31.37]Is this high stance?
[52:32.09]What am I doing?
[52:32.61]It looks like I'm jumping on it.
[52:37.83]Okay.
[52:40.01]Slash?
[52:40.61]So, there we go.
[52:43.14]Circle, circle.
[52:48.57]X. Okay.
[52:50.49]Middle stance.
[52:51.11]Let's just check it out.
[52:51.81]I need to learn this stuff.
[52:55.90]Alright, now let's get a big one.
[53:00.68]Ooh!
[53:01.94]Here we go.
[53:03.30]Let's try it.
[53:10.38]Nice.
[53:12.52]Go back to the thing.
[53:14.48]I already beat the thing.
[53:15.30]I can't play that twice.
[53:19.78]The last four hours of that game was dog shit.
[53:22.04]I don't want to do that again.
[53:34.45]Play the game again, but do it backwards.
[53:36.97]What do you mean put the controller backwards?
[53:39.71]No.
[53:39.95]Alright, Bushido Blade 2 is going in in just a minute.
[53:42.70]I'm going to have to... Alright, hold on.
[53:47.08]Forward, X, circle, triangle.
[53:50.20]I wanna try this.
[53:53.49]Forward, X, circle, triangle, triple slash.
[54:06.51]It's gonna be the same game but worse.
[54:08.67]I don't, will it?
[54:09.55]Alright, it's going in.
[54:18.36]I'm taking the band-aid off.
[54:21.16]Let me try to do this one thing.
[54:24.28]Am I in the wrong stance?
[54:26.43]Yeah, I am.
[54:30.53]Alright, fuck it.
[54:41.52]Take the second disk and snap it.
[54:46.34]Alright, I'm gonna be really upset with you guys if Bushido Blade 2 is much better.
[54:51.96]If this game is really, really fun and I love it, I'm gonna be upset.
[54:55.70]Because you guys tried to get me to, like, break it.
[55:07.27]It's actually awful?
[55:08.37]No.
[55:09.67]It can't be.
[55:10.71]The first one is fun and interesting and cool.
[55:12.69]How would the second one be worse?
[55:16.91]I guess this... Yeah, hold on.
[55:18.17]That's true.
[55:18.69]The sequel could be always worse.
[55:25.57]We're gonna try it, though.
[55:30.64]Is it not registering?
[55:31.56]There it is.
[55:46.16]People talking shit about Dark Souls 2 are people who can't beat Dark Souls without shields or sorcery.
[55:53.03]What?
[55:54.73]What does this have to do with anything?
[55:58.13]It has nothing to do with what we're doing.
[56:05.08]Just had to get it off his chest.
[56:15.15]The one guys are on a roll tonight.
[56:17.53]Yeah, they are.
[56:23.89]Oh, it's an example of a worse sequel.
[56:27.70]Okay, I see where you're going.
[56:42.71]Is this the only thing I'm going to be doing tonight?
[56:44.93]Probably not.
[56:52.20]Because I can imagine this is probably going to be another hour or so for this game.
[56:55.70]And I do have Siren, but should I start Siren after this?
[57:02.48]That might be a mistake, because it's a long game.
[57:06.59]And I'm going to disappear as of tomorrow.
[57:20.28]Dead Rising?
[57:21.50]No, no.
[57:22.20]I want to... No.
[57:23.36]I can't.
[57:24.60]No.
[57:25.64]That's going to be a string of at least a couple of streams in a row.
[57:35.36]You just disappeared for a week.
[57:36.93]Well, this is to set up the Halloween stream.
[57:40.15]Because I'm traveling for the Halloween stream.
[57:41.79]If you didn't know, I'm going to the East Coast to do it.
[57:59.12]Am I going to play horror games after Halloween?
[58:00.82]Probably not.
[58:03.96]There are like one or two that I'd like to do, but we've done a lot of scare games.
[58:12.28]Horror Thanksgiving.
[58:22.11]Um.
[58:24.63]Oh, okay.
[58:25.03]I was going to say, I can't read this.
[58:37.12]Alright, hold on.
[58:38.98]Master your weapon.
[58:40.34]Let's do this.
[58:46.90]Practice.
[58:47.70]Train with the ninja.
[58:49.04]Adjust the ninja's fighting pattern by pressing... Okay.
[58:52.35]Yeah.
[58:56.49]There's a lot of secret characters in this one.
[59:06.87]What do I want to be?
[59:07.51]Uh, I guess I'll be you.
[59:15.65]Spear?
[59:16.01]I'm doing spear.
[59:25.38]Oh, and you can do katana, whatever.
[59:33.76]The longer the better, that's right.
[59:44.09]Frontal attacks.
[59:44.83]Off, off, off.
[59:45.53]Okay.
[59:48.07]So.
[59:50.19]Holy shit, this thing is huge.
[59:54.49]Alright, so squares change stance in this one.
[59:56.89]Alright.
[60:02.65]I feel like I don't have to do anything but this.
[60:06.41]Do a swipe.
[60:07.01]Oh, wow.
[60:08.17]Okay, so X. I can go bang, bang, bang.
[60:16.13]Is there no blood in this one?
[60:23.29]The stage doesn't look finished.
[60:24.63]Well, it's just a training stage.
[60:28.39]This is lame.
[60:29.59]No blood.
[60:32.48]Hold on.
[60:33.52]Since there's no longer a parry button, in Bushido Blade 2, you must learn to use the attack buttons to parry.
[60:41.44]Oh.
[60:42.00]Is this why everyone doesn't like it?
[60:45.68]When the opponent attacks with X, hit O just before the attack.
[60:49.82]When the opponent attacks with Circle, hit X to counter.
[60:57.91]Okay.
[60:59.45]Well, that's good to know that there's no parry.
[61:01.37]Like, a parry button.
[61:05.59]God, I love spears.
[61:08.45]No blood.
[61:09.25]No blood.
[61:10.07]No blood.
[61:11.47]There's an actual dedicated jump button, though.
[61:28.11]Oh, that's sick.
[61:31.45]Oh, yeah.
[61:32.53]Oh, two is way better than one.
[61:35.07]Alright, I think I can do it.
[61:51.10]But there's the whole other things called rebound attacks.
[61:54.51]When an attack hits the opponent's weapon, a pink flash will appear.
[61:57.87]When this happens, both the attacker and the defender can follow up with a rebound attack.
[62:03.33]So if you're attacking and this happens, you press circle.
[62:07.88]If you're defending, if I'm hit, it's X. There it is.
[62:16.14]Where am I reading this?
[62:18.28]In the game's online manual.
[62:27.35]That's cheating.
[62:28.07]I'm reading the game's manual!
[62:29.63]Alright, weapon clash.
[62:31.67]When two attacks meet, a weapon clash will occur.
[62:33.47]A weapon clash has three phases.
[62:34.83]Ay yi yi.
[62:39.04]Neutral, advantage, and overpowering.
[62:41.30]In any phase... Is this just a spam button?
[62:43.40]Like, press it as fast as you can?
[62:45.98]In any phase, either player must hit the attack buttons more quickly than the other in any order to gain the advantage.
[62:51.35]I win.
[62:52.91]I will never lose one of those.
[62:53.85]Okay.
[62:58.59]So now, uh... What's this thing called?
[63:03.59]It's not called the spear.
[63:05.79]Oh, there it is.
[63:07.73]Okay.
[63:10.50]I'm ready.
[63:21.44]Top menu.
[63:25.02]Story mode, here we go.
[63:26.25]You can do POV story mode?
[63:27.41]That's kind of insane.
[63:31.16]A long time ago, there was an old man who lived in the Seto Inland Sea.
[63:41.11]800 years ago, there were two families who were close to this island.
[63:45.37]800 years ago.
[63:52.94]It's kind of hard to read.
[63:54.10]Was Honor in this game too?
[63:55.76]How does Honor work in this one?
[64:19.92]There's nothing on Bushido Blade 2's honor system.
[64:23.34]There is no honor in Bushido Blade 2.
[64:26.23]Why would they do that?
[64:50.92]First of all, you must take back the heart of the thief, Yuugiri.
[64:54.24]You can't fight honorably, or you'd lose.
[64:56.07]You must take back the heart of the Narukagami, Meikyokan.
[65:03.91]The Narukagami that touched this will be cut off by the last sword of the final battle.
[65:20.60]Okay, so I'm gonna just do the same thing.
[65:24.18]I think I have a good understanding what's going on.
[65:37.09]I'm on Tutorial Island.
[65:43.12]Now the moment has finally arrived to end this long ongoing battle that has lasted since the destruction of the Sui family.
[65:53.93]Can you endure the mission to avenge our wrath?
[65:58.17]Who's talking to me?
[65:59.19]Show me what you can do.
[66:02.39]Why test me now?
[66:06.58]What?
[66:11.21]I'm speaking from above in the rafters.
[66:15.20]I could just come down and meet you.
[66:18.86]But, holy shit, worse than one.
[66:21.28]Look at that fucking fake Virtua Fighter blood.
[66:32.21]How do you do that?
[66:37.59]You'll never win one of those.
[66:38.81]It'll never happen.
[66:47.57]Right in the head.
[66:53.15]Oh, what?
[66:53.57]That was right in the head!
[67:04.89]You probably shouldn't have done that, but it's okay.
[67:10.75]How many times do I have to do this to prove myself?
[67:17.66]Alright, we're going in with the s- with the s- the slide thing.
[67:19.84]Nice.
[67:23.51]Okay, d- do- can I?
[67:25.13]You have proven yourself worthy.
[67:28.23]Go to the Meikyokan and reclaim our sacred sword, Yugiri.
[67:35.43]Now that the Meikyokan is shorthanded, they are nothing.
[67:41.28]I don't have a choice.
[67:43.78]I guess I have to go.
[67:46.00]By the way, Dad, can we get some furniture in the living room?
[67:48.92]The echo is really, really fucking strong.
[68:01.34]Instantly got him.
[68:02.26]Wait, we're going again?
[68:12.35]You'll never win.
[68:21.20]Oh, he broke my arm, but it doesn't matter.
[68:25.28]I can do this with one hand.
[68:26.68]Oh, shit.
[68:27.38]One-handed.
[68:29.06]Right in the face.
[68:30.20]Just let him walk into it.
[68:31.78]He'll walk into it.
[68:36.18]Spare's the best weapon.
[68:41.22]You're not a Narukagami.
[68:44.66]If you wish to live, go.
[68:46.94]I am Narukagami.
[68:51.23]For a second, I thought he was standing up.
[68:57.21]And I was like, oh.
[69:03.49]My arm is still broken.
[69:08.21]Oh, that was a smart play.
[69:09.85]See ya.
[69:20.30]I'll never understand that stance.
[69:21.98]The stance we're both doing.
[69:23.80]A pity.
[69:27.23]Why hold your hands up?
[69:28.85]All of your vital organs are, like, in your armpits, you know what I mean?
[69:31.57]Like, if you get slashed in the armpits... A newcomer.
[69:36.41]State your purpose.
[69:38.31]There are many enemies ahead.
[69:39.43]I'll help.
[69:41.01]Highwayman, was it?
[69:42.95]What?
[69:43.57]You helped me?
[69:47.08]Yes, I am a newcomer.
[69:48.64]But I'm very skilled.
[69:52.59]Good to see you again.
[69:54.77]I do doubt you.
[70:01.06]Not gonna pull a gun out on me, are you?
[70:06.92]He's like... He's dressed... Wait.
[70:14.48]I'm... It's me now.
[70:16.79]What if I just lose?
[70:20.84]Oh, you suck!
[70:21.38]You're not fast enough!
[70:29.88]Oops.
[70:33.87]Is that it?
[70:39.23]Is he dying?
[70:54.92]That's fucking funny.
[70:56.56]Alright, hold on.
[71:00.24]There's a different ending, I think.
[71:04.00]Why did I give him the spear?
[71:05.26]I didn't know how to use this shit.
[71:09.00]Here, let me see that weapon I have no idea how to use.
[71:12.04]It can't be that hard.
[71:13.80]He's just sticking with the end that's sharp.
[71:23.23]Why would you charge a guy with a spear like that?
[71:25.03]Mistake.
[71:33.58]Too flashy.
[71:34.16]Too flashy.
[71:34.52]Just go back to basics.
[71:42.51]Spear is seriously the best weapon.
[71:46.27]Oh shit!
[71:46.91]What happens if I die?
[71:53.55]We're good.
[71:55.48]I already broke my fucking arm.
[72:07.18]Cross it.
[72:07.70]There it is.
[72:13.39]Dumb.
[72:14.89]I didn't even do anything, he just ran into it.
[72:18.09]Same thing.
[72:19.45]I'm like a spike trap on the wall.
[72:24.57]sorry as long as I'm here you won't be going any further okay why are we fighting in a oh hold on why are we in a parking garage I'm just realizing this right now weren't we like 800 years ago wait this is 800 years ago this is what
[72:55.35]I can't even... Okay, let's go.
[72:59.93]You gotta start back here.
[73:01.21]Right there.
[73:03.13]Boom.
[73:06.61]Triple combo.
[73:10.94]They're LARPing in a parking lot.
[73:13.32]This guy's just died.
[73:31.23]Live action role.
[73:32.59]They actually added a person with an assault rifle.
[73:39.37]Okay.
[73:39.67]Parking garages, assault rifle.
[73:53.56]She blocked my sword with the gun and then shot me.
[73:56.77]Of course.
[74:12.20]Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill point blank killer get her oh My gosh, she's so bad killer.
[74:21.14]Oh
[74:36.17]Are you trying to unleash the Shinto's grudge with the Yugiri?
[74:42.74]You said grudge?
[74:45.68]Well, well now.
[74:46.96]Is that how wrongly the Narukagami have distorted the Shinto's sentiments?
[74:58.55]The eye died.
[74:59.41]The eye died.
[75:08.11]Stewie Griffin.
[75:17.77]This sounds like me.
[75:19.03]I was gonna say this- I do this voice a lot for how they- for new- for like- when I- I do this voice a lot.
[75:25.65]I'm just- it's coming to me.
[75:27.17]Fistbun!
[75:27.65]I do this one all the time!
[75:28.69]Oh, I do this all the time.
[75:30.11]No.
[75:30.67]That's why I use the spear.
[75:41.55]Alright, let's do a World of Attack.
[75:47.65]Ooh, got him right in the toe.
[75:53.42]Don't let him get up.
[75:53.96]There's no honor anymore.
[76:00.46]Bring it up.
[76:01.40]Let him walk into it.
[76:02.02]Bingo.
[76:16.09]I mean, it sounds like Michael Jackson.
[76:18.03]I mean, like, exactly.
[76:44.20]Damn!
[76:45.02]You've outdone me again!
[76:49.14]This is nothing.
[76:50.92]Besides, it's not over yet.
[76:56.26]Yeah, undoubtedly.
[76:58.04]Unless we sever the enemy's bloodline, we won't reach our true goal.
[77:00.98]Where's your weapon?
[77:02.50]Vengeance to settle this prolonged hatred?
[77:06.44]Revenge has nothing to do with me, but I suppose it can't be helped.
[77:10.98]Uh, okay.
[77:11.76]This is called the Tar Shrine Path.
[77:14.64]Wait, what?
[77:39.12]Why does it keep changing characters on me?
[77:50.64]Wait, what?
[77:51.96]Oh.
[77:53.68]Bring it down.
[77:54.44]Bring it straight in.
[77:55.46]Oh, that guy got fucking destroyed.
[78:11.50]Ooh, what happened to your arm?
[78:12.74]You okay?
[78:13.48]Something wrong?
[78:17.27]Ooh, got it.
[78:18.95]Again we go.
[78:21.15]Okay, let's go down.
[78:22.79]Ooh.
[78:47.35]What are you doing?
[78:48.11]Why are you holding onto your hair?
[78:50.53]That's what I do.
[78:51.84]I do that.
[78:52.14]I get it.
[78:52.40]Oh shit.
[78:52.76]Did he say help?
[79:18.07]Ooh, shit.
[79:18.97]My arm.
[79:20.31]Go low, go low.
[79:21.07]Low, low, low, low.
[79:22.11]Just run.
[79:23.99]Low.
[79:24.49]Can I do it low?
[79:25.11]Okay.
[79:27.33]Sweet.
[79:35.53]Come on, you can do better than that.
[79:37.99]Got it.
[79:38.69]One more.
[79:38.95]Ooh!
[79:52.20]So, alright, so I go back to me?
[80:06.41]Me?
[80:08.33]No, me.
[80:13.38]That was a good damage hit.
[80:21.22]Do it again.
[80:21.52]Do it again this time.
[80:25.14]Swing it down.
[80:27.38]And... Oh!
[80:28.20]Oh, his arm.
[80:34.83]I love that combo.
[80:39.01]What?
[80:39.25]What?
[80:39.43]Oops.
[80:51.97]Don't.
[80:53.65]Don't.
[80:58.63]Don't.
[81:03.05]I do like the fact that they give you these little... Hold on, let me just instant win this.
[81:11.17]There's a little fist bash at the end of that.
[81:18.41]Okay.
[81:24.98]Bring down.
[81:26.26]I like the down.
[81:28.14]Gives you an opportunity to get killed.
[81:30.16]Because you get too greedy and do the same move.
[81:41.51]Already broken arm.
[81:42.19]That's such bullshit.
[81:43.55]Already.
[81:43.97]Right in the chest.
[81:58.53]Get it!
[81:59.05]Come on!
[82:00.17]No!
[82:00.53]They're getting smarter.
[82:08.89]Why am I killing these people?
[82:09.79]I really have no idea.
[82:12.81]What the fuck?
[82:13.27]What's that weapon?
[82:29.07]Why did you... Hold on.
[82:30.11]Your weapon's cooler than mine.
[82:32.33]You got, like, the ten cards in the iPad game that are my weapon, and then I pay, like, four dollars and it upgrades into that one.
[82:39.04]I want that one.
[82:40.08]What's that one called?
[82:43.52]Ooh, that would've been a great counter!
[82:54.97]So would that!
[82:58.37]Fuck.
[83:05.78]You could have chosen in the beginning.
[83:08.38]I stick with what I have.
[83:09.84]Oh my god.
[83:11.74]She just took out my whole entire thing.
[83:14.06]Thorax, whatever it's called.
[83:17.58]No, that's an ant.
[83:18.78]That's like an ant's body.
[83:20.19]The thing in your throat.
[83:32.77]You're long too, so it's fair.
[83:34.33]I don't like this.
[83:36.79]The larynx.
[83:37.29]There it is.
[83:41.02]Oh, I tried to do like the scoop, but I couldn't get you with it.
[83:44.10]I'm too slow.
[83:44.82]Fuck.
[83:55.76]Right in the middle.
[83:57.36]What are you doing?
[83:58.28]Excuse me.
[84:00.46]What?
[84:06.75]You would cut your hands up so much.
[84:08.35]Alright, let's end this The end is near
[84:33.21]Always without the weapon too, you just find a new one.
[84:35.27]What?
[84:37.09]Okay.
[85:01.85]This guy has magic powers.
[85:03.83]Okay, I think I have to counter him.
[85:32.88]Yeah, I have to counter him.
[85:35.58]Alright, I have to wait till he attacks and then counter him.
[85:47.98]How the fuck do I do this?
[85:51.93]When I see that little flash, I gotta... counter it.
[85:54.61]So, like, wham.
[85:57.65]And... counter it.
[86:05.37]Maybe he'll run out of mana.
[86:08.93]Damn it.
[86:28.20]He's running out of mana.
[86:29.02]His teleport gets shorter and shorter.
[86:30.36]Is that for real?
[86:41.51]He's probably in, like, a false insecu- Alright.
[86:46.59]That was a pretty cool move, but...
[87:05.52]Looks the same, yeah.
[87:06.44]No, I'm gonna have to counter or something.
[87:11.58]Like that, but... How's that for magic powers?
[87:30.88]Oh!
[87:32.14]Damn it!
[87:32.78]Come on!
[87:33.28]How did I miss him?
[87:34.02]I like grazed his ear.
[87:35.32]He blocked it on the ground.
[87:49.13]He's blocking them on the ground.
[87:58.94]How are you doing that?
[88:01.96]Alright, low.
[88:22.43]Get over here.
[88:27.00]That was- I parried and countered.
[88:29.26]What happened?
[88:40.94]This is a nice boss theme Yeah, the crickets and the owl Stand perfectly still Why would I do that?
[89:09.63]Alright, I'm going to try to block.
[89:12.99]Okay, he swings.
[89:13.55]I'm going to swing with circle.
[89:14.93]And then hit X. No, that was X. Only attack when the owls hoot.
[89:39.11]Do something, please, do anything.
[89:41.05]Oh my god.
[89:47.54]I mean, he's almost like he's too far away to counter.
[89:50.06]I like, hold on.
[89:57.82]I like the idea, hold on, let me try this again.
[89:59.44]He's on the ground, I just have to sweep the ground.
[90:13.34]I googled it.
[90:13.82]You need to hit him enough times so he teleports next to you, then... What?
[90:21.88]Hit him enough times till he teleports next to you, and then stab him.
[90:30.67]Okay, hold on.
[90:41.37]Is he getting closer?
[90:44.72]Did I hit him or did he hit me?
[90:47.74]I can't tell.
[90:48.28]Oh, come on.
[91:01.71]Come on.
[91:05.01]He's definitely not getting closer.
[91:06.61]Are we sure?
[91:12.50]I need, like, this one.
[91:13.80]Because then I can just go, stab, run.
[91:22.05]Kick him.
[91:22.61]How do you kick?
[91:25.79]Google says he gets closer.
[91:27.01]If you get stuck on this, you can play the first one again.
[91:28.93]What?
[91:30.65]Kick.
[91:34.79]What's a kick?
[91:35.27]It's jump.
[91:37.47]What if I jump?
[91:44.88]You have to hit him until he teleports next to you, then kill him there.
[91:47.40]So yeah, so I was doing it right.
[91:50.06]He definitely is getting closer.
[91:51.30]There's no way he's not.
[91:53.56]Yeah, he is.
[91:54.18]He is.
[91:55.02]He is.
[91:58.60]There he is!
[92:10.26]Don't you fucking dare.
[92:11.38]Okay, now.
[92:17.30]Don't fucking die.
[92:18.02]God damn it, he did.
[92:26.91]Oh my god.
[92:40.41]You're a real pain in the ass, do you know that?
[92:56.47]Don't you dare.
[92:57.90]Alright, that's a good one.
[93:06.48]That's a good one.
[93:06.96]I like this one.
[93:07.60]It's more defense.
[93:18.08]Don't do the third attack.
[93:19.72]It's not worth it.
[93:20.28]Alright, I countered and parried, and he went further away.
[93:28.97]No, please, please, please, please.
[93:31.69]No, stop it.
[93:32.47]He keeps, like, sidestepping me.
[93:41.24]Why is he getting further away?
[93:49.68]Oh shit, he's right behind me!
[94:00.51]Oh, come on!
[94:03.87]Oh, come on!
[94:14.43]So you have to do that until he is actually right next to your body.
[94:20.50]Is this the boss of the game?
[94:35.85]Swing the spear instead of poking him.
[94:38.23]But look at how vulnerable I am.
[95:01.24]This is stupid.
[95:02.46]Oh my fucking god.
[95:11.69]Just throw sand at him?
[95:25.45]Alright, here we go, come on.
[95:27.95]Okay, cool.
[95:30.03]Fun.
[95:32.41]Great.
[95:39.15]Okay, fun.
[95:40.57]This is fun.
[95:42.78]Oh my god, okay, he can't be doing it that many more times, right?
[95:55.76]You don't- Die!
[96:03.25]Oh my fucking god.
[96:08.09]Jesus Christ.
[96:10.87]Ugh, he-
[96:27.02]Have I actually hit him once?
[96:28.70]No, because you have to hit him until apparently he teleports directly next to your body.
[96:36.16]To him.
[96:37.42]Because he has to be kneeling like that, and that's the only time he can be hit.
[96:46.35]But he can hit me once.
[96:51.10]I have to hit him like 20 times.
[96:57.34]Can I put him in a corner?
[96:58.16]No, because he teleports behind me.
[97:00.00]I'm just going to do this and see what happens.
[97:02.10]I'm just going to keep doing this.
[97:04.92]Just do it the exact same way every time.
[97:15.66]I'm close.
[97:19.31]But he goes behind you!
[97:26.75]Oh.
[97:27.51]My.
[97:28.77]God.
[97:29.15]Do it with my eyes closed.
[97:39.76]Okay.
[97:53.47]Um...
[97:58.26]Why?
[97:58.74]What?
[98:01.74]Why is it doing that?
[98:04.83]Oh, it's because my webcam's not plugged in.
[98:08.29]So it's taking the last frame that it captured.
[98:16.38]Alright, hold on.
[98:23.04]Can I even plug this in?
[98:24.30]No, I can't.
[98:24.78]Because I have to unplug...
[98:28.76]I have too many USBs plugged in.
[98:32.06]Well I guess, actually yes I can.
[98:34.34]I can.
[98:34.66]I have to unplug my mouse.
[98:38.68]Okay.
[98:44.20]I have too many USBs plugged in and they're all incredibly useful.
[98:56.23]Oh shit.
[98:58.25]Okay.
[99:00.53]I just tried to use my mouse, that's not gonna work.
[99:06.89]Did it work?
[99:16.82]No, I need my mouse.
[99:18.66]Hold on.
[99:24.11]Why is the Razer app opening right now?
[99:26.21]No, I'm not gonna install your fucking garbage software.
[99:29.71]Get out of here.
[99:53.85]Hey!
[100:00.25]Look at how red I am now.
[100:04.48]It's the same shirt.
[100:06.58]Yeah, cause it's the same day.
[100:09.28]It's the same day.
[100:10.18]It's been like probably an hour and 45 minutes since that image was captured.
[100:19.04]Is it desync?
[100:20.48]Fuckin' who cares.
[100:22.98]Alright.
[100:24.36]I'll turn off the desync.
[100:25.44]There's no desync, you liars.
[100:26.52]Oh no, there is actually.
[100:30.58]You guys are not lying.
[100:32.72]Hold on.
[100:35.78]Sorry to... Sorry to really fly off the handle on that one.
[100:40.60]Okay.
[100:41.69]Now... I'll do it with my eyes closed.
[100:44.77]This is not going to even work.
[100:47.31]Why am I doing this?
[100:53.62]Okay, ready?
[100:55.78]Why did it just- I heard like five moves.
[101:23.45]Why am I alive?
[101:54.00]Don't sidestep that.
[101:56.16]This is the best way to do this.
[101:57.80]It is.
[101:59.42]Just get away.
[102:00.48]Only attack if you know you have an opening to do this.
[102:02.56]He's getting closer.
[102:12.42]Here it comes.
[102:14.40]Shit.
[102:15.00]It's okay.
[102:17.74]Run.
[102:18.68]Do it again.
[102:20.36]Run.
[102:21.88]Do it again.
[102:26.90]Oh!
[102:27.21]Oh!
[102:29.75]Oh!
[102:30.85]Don't!
[102:31.01]Don't!
[102:31.15]Don't!
[102:31.29]Don't!
[102:31.45]Don't!
[102:31.65]Don't!
[102:31.87]Don't!
[102:32.07]Don't!
[102:32.27]Don't!
[102:32.71]Run!
[102:35.15]Run!
[102:36.47]Don't, please.
[102:42.58]His armor's broken.
[103:01.30]I didn't even look at him.
[103:16.45]Oh my God.
[103:18.60]I got it.
[103:18.96]Ow, my chest.
[103:30.55]What does that mean?
[103:31.71]I know what it means.
[103:33.99]What, does he have Lego hair?
[103:43.83]That's not it, there's more.
[103:50.21]So you're the one.
[103:52.45]You have come.
[103:54.65]By orders of Shanto, I have come to kill you.
[104:00.46]Yes.
[104:02.97]It is the mission of your clan.
[104:04.83]To take my life with your yugiri and end our existence.
[104:13.56]It was 800 years ago that our ancestors, the Kagami family, betrayed the Suede family and destroyed them.
[104:27.87]I'm like sidestepping.
[104:28.83]Just do it.
[104:29.47]I don't have Lego here.
[104:30.87]Do it.
[104:31.17]Are you gonna do it or what are you doing?
[105:00.27]Come on.
[105:00.63]I wanna get this right.
[105:03.03]I want, like, a full-on baseball swing.
[105:12.43]Wait.
[105:12.97]Try this way?
[105:16.93]There it is.
[105:17.35]Alright.
[105:17.85]Ready?
[105:18.05]So it's one, two, three.
[105:21.83]Just practicing.
[105:23.59]One, two.
[105:25.25]Whatever.
[105:27.56]What do you mean, faith?
[105:28.08]Bad end.
[105:28.26]Do you guys really give a shit about the bad end of Bushido Blade 2?
[105:33.58]I'll just have to do it again.
[105:57.97]And the people of Suei fought for the Suei family.
[106:01.91]That's all there was to it.
[106:05.43]And even if there was betrayal, there should be no shame or regret.
[106:13.57]As one of the Kagami family, was it not your destiny to fight until the very end?
[106:20.09]To fight in order to protect something.
[106:23.27]In the end, that may have actually saved you.
[106:30.12]Watch the blade!
[106:32.24]It's gonna step on a rake and it's gonna hit you in the face!
[106:34.71]Alright, how do I do the assault rifle?
[107:04.99]How do I unlock Assault Rifle in this game?
[107:17.25]You changed the game first.
[107:18.25]No, not yet.
[107:29.12]Let's go with...
[107:32.21]Not broadsword.
[107:33.25]We did big and slow.
[107:34.17]I want small and usable.
[107:38.86]Not longsword.
[107:40.92]An Adachi.
[107:46.38]Small streamer.
[107:48.34]Get that person out of here.
[107:51.98]I'm going to do this quick.
[107:54.11]My hair has not moved.
[108:01.78]Alright, let me make this done real quick.
[108:12.24]Just wild swings and gives a shit.
[108:16.40]I'm just trying to... I like that one.
[108:20.83]Okay, good.
[108:22.25]Keep going.
[108:22.57]That was a nice counter.
[108:31.18]That's kinda cool, but not cool enough.
[108:33.40]That's the hair from the last time his frame was captured.
[108:39.26]Alright, now you got me looking over at the chatroom about my LEGO body.
[108:46.11]Whatever it is.
[108:48.03]Why do I have two headphones in?
[108:48.97]I don't need them for this game.
[108:49.85]Because I need to be able to hear you guys.
[109:01.43]Get it!
[109:04.52]Bring it over this way.
[109:05.60]Cross.
[109:05.88]Got it.
[109:37.31]It's not, this is not accurate.
[109:39.44]This is not accurate.
[110:16.39]Hold on.
[110:47.41]That's fine God damn it
[111:19.77]How the fuck would you even know what that is?
[111:21.89]How would you even know?
[111:40.33]It's mirrored so it's hard for me to do this.
[112:23.80]It's exactly the fucking same.
[112:25.85]It looks nice, so...
[112:45.34]Unless we destroy every kinsman of the Shinto clan, nothing will ever change.
[112:51.17]We must obliterate them.
[112:53.41]I'll take care of it.
[112:55.69]Oh, look, he's got the same fucking Lego hair.
[112:57.91]Doesn't he?
[113:00.13]Same hair.
[113:02.53]Oh, look at that.
[113:05.56]We all know that the Shinto headquarters is located on that island.
[113:09.62]It's clear then.
[113:11.16]I am the one who will go.
[113:24.40]Yeah, the fucking, guess what?
[113:36.44]Lego hair looks pretty damn good.
[113:40.74]It's nice and smooth and it's styled.
[113:43.34]I'm gonna kill this guy right when he lands.
[113:44.30]Watch this, one, two, three.
[113:46.66]Lie.
[113:49.83]Dremel lied about Minecraft VR.
[113:51.25]Dremel lied about Minecraft VR.
[113:55.84]Jumer's hair looks like Minecraft VR.
[113:59.79]Oh!
[114:00.17]He did the thing I wanted to do.
[114:15.51]I'm not even paying attention.
[114:22.44]I'm supposed to be learning combos.
[114:27.76]1, let's see, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2.
[114:33.54]So there's a 1, 2.
[114:35.46]There's a 2 combo.
[114:41.41]Play the first game.
[114:42.73]I already did.
[114:43.49]I already beat the first game, honorably, by the way.
[114:59.97]I'm running and being violent.
[115:01.61]I need to control my emotions.
[115:04.53]I thought I had it.
[115:10.79]There it is.
[115:17.14]I'm not clicking any more LEGO links.
[115:19.96]I didn't know you were a Shinto.
[115:22.24]So we meet again.
[115:23.52]This time I'll win.
[115:41.42]That's not even it.
[115:48.70]Why is there a green screen image of a balding Lego character template?
[115:54.82]Why?
[115:55.84]What is this for?
[116:05.45]What is the application of this image?
[116:18.54]Just because we're low on forces doesn't mean the Narukagami are weak.
[116:27.79]Wait a minute, no, that's gonna put me in there.
[116:31.59]Let me help.
[116:33.11]Who are you?
[116:34.79]I am Night Stalker, from Koga.
[116:37.25]Called upon by Red Shadow.
[116:40.95]I don't need help.
[116:43.09]Please.
[116:44.81]I've come here to help you, and that's just what I'm going to do.
[116:48.82]Should something happen to me, then you take it from there.
[116:54.30]Wait!
[117:19.19]Oh my god, it's trying to key out my green teeth.
[117:23.03]No, it's not.
[117:23.49]Okay.
[117:23.86]I thought I had green ass teeth right there for a second.
[117:26.46]No, I don't have... Look, I don't have green teeth.
[117:31.18]Wait, I'm a new character.
[117:33.28]I don't... I'm done.
[117:47.59]This looks like my hair's up in a bun.
[117:53.75]Alright, let's key out green.
[118:02.20]That doesn't do anything.
[118:06.88]Okay, I thought I didn't grab it.
[118:08.98]Oh, fuck.
[118:21.95]I actually like this.
[118:24.15]This is kind of fun.
[118:25.21]The tree is coming down.
[118:34.53]That's okay.
[118:35.49]That's very clearly... Alright, well to do this correctly... Give me a second.
[118:41.56]I'm gonna do this correctly because everybody wants to see this correctly done.
[118:50.43]It would actually be more like this.
[118:51.63]Because they have these square heads.
[119:16.47]Not that way.
[119:30.19]No, wrong image.
[119:30.87]Now it looks like I'm wearing a fuckin' old, like, 1930s football helmet.
[119:46.40]This is not correct.
[120:33.91]There you go.
[120:34.55]I'm done.
[120:36.61]Don't say I never- Don't say I never did anything for you.
[120:41.62]Oh, do this one too.
[120:42.78]I'm- I'm trying to play Bushido Blade 2.
[120:53.65]Fuck this game.
[121:01.86]This is not, this is like, I don't know, what is this?
[121:04.38]Is this supposed to be like a beard?
[121:13.55]No, it's like a, what is this?
[121:22.86]Where's the image?
[121:30.70]Oh, right, there's a bald cap on it.
[121:32.70]Okay, hold on.
[121:44.79]This is gonna be hard to do because of this color.
[121:48.15]I have to key out this color.
[121:49.55]This is stupid.
[121:50.77]It's not even the same color as my, like, skin tone.
[121:55.82]Hold on.
[122:00.60]It's closing in on them.
[122:04.20]Alright.
[122:04.70]I'm going to add another key.
[122:07.27]Okay.
[122:12.65]And it's going to be this color.
[122:14.80]Not green.
[122:17.56]Custom color.
[122:26.99]Okay, it's this.
[122:28.99]Where's my little grabber thing?
[122:33.19]I need to put it over there on there.
[122:34.37]I don't think I can.
[122:40.42]Hold on, here we go.
[122:41.72]No, not that.
[122:43.14]Wrong one.
[122:43.50]This one?
[122:44.40]It's like that one.
[122:50.88]Okay, let's see what happens.
[122:51.68]They're too similar.
[122:57.35]Oh, hey.
[122:58.21]Oh, well.
[123:18.14]What?
[123:18.34]Somebody made a cutout?
[123:21.94]What's happening right now?
[123:22.96]What is going on?
[123:32.52]I don't have Photoshop open right here.
[123:34.68]I've got like a stream going.
[123:36.46]I've got Streamlabs.
[123:38.16]I've got my game.
[123:39.18]I'm not like, oh, let me open up Photoshop over here.
[123:42.50]That looks like, yeah, let me use the pen tool.
[123:47.32]Open paint?
[123:47.92]I can't open paint.
[123:48.86]I'm 600 milliseconds behind.
[123:50.58]This game sucks.
[123:56.31]I didn't say it.
[123:57.45]In fact, I didn't because this one was, I actually had fun with this one.
[124:04.14]Why is it all dirty?
[124:09.15]Why?
[124:09.53]This just looks like I'm wearing a hat.
[124:33.03]Hold on.
[124:35.36]OK, I want to change weight, color correction.
[125:14.64]It just looks like I have a fucking giant white head as a fucking skull.
[125:21.96]What if I just like... Like that, this is not, this is just a cyst.
[125:47.06]Good, did everybody get their screenshots?
[125:50.50]Now make an angry face.
[125:56.61]I'm like held hostage right now.
[126:01.91]Okay.
[126:04.40]Okay, okay, alright, alright, alright.
[126:28.19]I'm trying to match this.
[126:47.14]There you go.
[126:47.48]That's all you get.
[126:48.26]Good night.
[126:56.59]Dr. Phil.
[127:12.74]I think the game broke.
[127:14.60]What happened?
[127:16.06]Oh, wait.
[127:16.96]Hold on.
[127:17.76]Did I die so many times with this character that his plot armor melted?
[127:21.38]I died like 15 times.
[127:37.84]Siren, siren, siren.
[127:39.32]Hold on.
[127:39.84]I just... I like this game.
[127:45.08]Alright, you're gonna get a choice.
[127:46.32]You're gonna get a choice.
[127:49.74]No, you're not.
[127:50.57]I lied.
[127:51.05]You're not getting a choice.
[127:57.35]You should feel honored that you're about to be defeated by Joe.

[130:44.31]You climb up because you're getting destroyed.
[130:46.09]I'm going to hit you.
[130:46.72]I don't even care.
[130:48.32]Fucking honor.
[130:49.40]Nope.
[130:51.14]Yeah, I'm going to cut your damn fingers off.
[130:53.86]Come on.
[130:54.46]Get up here.
[131:27.17]My doctor's gonna be so mad at me.
[131:30.40]I keep hurting myself.
[131:45.53]Okay.
[131:48.42]Don't go that way.
[131:55.42]That's so funny.
[132:00.17]What's going on?
[132:01.63]Where am I?
[132:03.21]Where am I?
[132:07.43]Alright, alright.
[132:16.69]Press R2 and then hit circle.
[132:24.67]Alright, to be fair though, I did not realize what was going on until like I was by the rock.
[132:31.13]Could I?
[132:31.69]Okay, once I got to about right here, I may have been able to stop, but even if I turned around quickly right here, I don't think I would have done it.
[132:46.76]Sorry, R2... Wait, R2 and then circle?
[132:51.73]Holy shit, I... You say I throw knives.
[132:55.25]That's not a knife.
[132:56.49]That's a full sword.
[132:58.95]Alright, give me that back.
[133:08.02]Can I pick it up?
[133:12.80]I don't... I can't pick this up.
[133:24.19]You just died already.
[133:28.33]How does that not kill you?
[133:33.54]There it is.
[133:42.00]Oh, I can't throw it because I don't have a hand to throw it with.
[133:54.10]This game sucks.
[133:54.86]Please, shred it.
[134:05.07]I win.
[134:06.21]I'm not gonna shred this.
[134:09.24]You can shred the Guy Fieri game because it was $4.
[134:11.22]Bushido Blade 2 was like $30 or $40.
[134:15.92]This is like a rare game.
[134:17.32]You don't shred this one.
[134:37.36]Back it up.
[134:38.34]There it is.
[134:42.98]It's pretty incredible, wasn't it?
[134:50.27]Please drop her off the cliff.
[134:52.37]Why do I want that to happen?
[134:59.43]Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty good image.
[135:02.11]I will tell you.
[135:02.73]That's a pretty good image.
[135:06.89]What a twist.
[135:07.93]He said I was his brother.
[135:11.07]What does it mean?
[135:14.05]What's the matter, Tatsumi?
[135:15.13]It means you're that person's brother.
[135:17.89]That's your... You came from the same parents.
[135:20.81]He said I was his brother.
[135:23.63]If that's so... Tatsumi, do not fight any longer.
[135:30.99]Perhaps you were never meant to carry a sword.
[135:34.37]What are you saying?
[135:35.59]In fact, you aren't carrying it at all.
[135:37.79]Seems to be glued to the tops of your fingers.
[135:42.40]I do not want you to be exposed for what you are.
[135:46.72]It can't be.
[135:49.24]I'm a Shinto?
[135:51.44]Quiet.
[135:53.15]That wasn't that loud.
[135:56.29]Lay down your sword.
[135:58.83]Got it?
[136:04.46]Okay, so would I have a choice here?
[136:06.40]Oh, no, I... Ooh, I like this.
[136:21.03]Ooh, I like that.
[136:23.01]I like the spin.
[136:26.51]Oh, he's dead.
[136:27.17]Must have died to that character.
[136:28.13]They're no longer part of the game.
[136:37.46]And, by the way, they died to a default enemy.
[136:50.47]They died to the default, regular, just enemy.
[136:54.17]That's sad.
[137:16.72]Oh, he's trying to bury it in his head.
[137:21.73]There it is.
[137:24.49]Ooh.
[137:32.06]Damn it.
[137:32.70]I missed.
[137:33.52]What the fuck was that?
[137:43.22]Dammit.
[137:44.16]He blocked it twice.
[137:45.20]Did we cut the shit?
[137:48.86]Alright, his arm is broken.
[137:56.87]Alright, I'm looking over at the chat and I see more purple text than white text.
[138:06.04]And it also doesn't help that this link is like a Google image link that's like... What the fuck just happened?
[138:14.38]Who shot me with a gun off-screen?
[138:27.41]Alright, I wanna stab.
[138:32.49]I wanna get something like this.
[138:34.85]I mean, that's a pretty cool follow-up, but that thing never works.
[138:46.22]Let's go back this way.
[138:48.83]Got it.
[138:50.49]It's a virus link.
[138:51.91]It's a Discord link.
[139:01.66]That's the same thing.
[139:06.04]Oh, that's me from before.
[139:07.84]Now I have to kill me.
[139:18.13]That move is so dumb.
[139:20.27]What does it even do?
[139:23.57]It just makes me vulnerable to getting hit in the face.
[139:27.74]And I didn't get it.
[139:42.65]Same move.
[139:44.07]Same ideas.
[139:51.88]That would've been nice.
[139:56.38]So with that... Shit!
[140:10.44]Joopstorm, attention!
[140:11.77]Joopstorm, chat is bored!
[140:13.13]Joopstorm, attention!
[140:14.21]Joopstorm, chat is bored!
[140:21.57]I go, what is this?
[140:27.40]What, is this the school bus back from the field trip?
[140:32.20]Am I the bus driver?
[140:33.22]And I look back, and everyone's just like, Joobstorm!
[140:38.04]Joobstorm!
[140:39.02]Joobstorm!
[140:39.66]And I'm like, goddammit, kid!
[140:45.41]I'm trying to drive!
[140:53.93]I know everybody was really excited going to the old English village!
[141:01.19]But relax!
[141:15.32]Was I bleeding out of my stomach?
[141:16.82]Master Utsusemi.
[141:20.18]I cannot lay down my sword.
[141:25.34]For a second, I thought the audio was off the whole screen.
[141:33.11]Go to the McDonald's drive-thru with a school bus.
[141:38.91]That would be the most fucking ridiculous thing.
[141:42.69]Imagine seeing a school bus in front of you at the Burger King.
[141:47.54]You'd be like, nope, I'm gonna go somewhere else.
[141:54.22]Somebody said, can we play something else besides Bushido Butthole 2?
[142:18.40]Excuse me.
[142:19.56]This is a fucking, this is a classic game.
[142:23.21]That is very, very... It paved the way for a lot of stuff.
[142:26.67]And it's fun.
[142:27.57]I'm playing it.
[142:33.31]What?
[142:35.74]I just did that to him to look cool, because he looked cool.
[142:47.92]R2, then jump.
[142:50.36]Holy shit, that was cool.
[142:53.50]What?
[142:57.56]A sword came out of him.
[142:59.50]Wait, why did the sword come out?
[143:08.80]If the game is so good, why did they only make two?
[143:11.68]Okay, why did they only make two Parappas?
[143:15.34]Why are there only two Paper Marios?
[143:26.74]Why are there only two Chrono games?
[143:35.30]God damn it, I lost again.
[143:38.58]Why are there only two Team Fortresses?
[143:40.58]Why are there only two Half-Lives?
[143:47.92]In fact, if a game has more than three or four iterations, it's usually a shitty game franchise.
[143:55.46]You ever think about that one?
[143:56.38]6,000 IQ chat room?
[143:57.76]Look at that thing.
[143:59.21]That thing's awesome.
[144:02.01]What's that called?
[144:05.53]That's like the Moonlit Greatsword.
[144:13.54]That thing is so cool.
[144:14.04]What is that called?
[144:27.67]Ain't gonna let you do that shit.
[144:30.13]Ooh!
[144:34.03]That would've been good.
[144:34.61]His arm's fucked up.
[144:35.68]No, I can't believe it.
[144:38.16]It's called Big Sword.
[144:44.38]Guys, I'm only doing this to get to the end so I can kill the lady again.
[144:48.66]And everyone can go... What?
[144:50.64]The D... The D phase.
[145:09.01]Down!
[145:10.15]Down!
[145:11.59]Down!
[145:11.89]Oh, the spin.
[145:14.01]Wait.
[145:15.01]Is it teleporting person?
[145:16.03]Uh-oh, it's teleporter.
[145:38.93]Nope.
[145:39.05]Wait, it is.
[145:39.29]Wait, is it?
[145:39.71]Is it new?
[145:42.61]Is it new guy?
[145:43.05]It is.
[145:43.17]Thank God.
[146:23.99]He's got an armor gimmick.
[146:29.46]He just bounced it off his chest like it was nothing.
[146:53.01]I'm countering it every time!
[146:56.13]Push it out of the level.
[147:54.11]He has like this thing on his back, is that like a spot to hit?
[148:25.12]Okay, I can't hit him.
[148:27.06]He's running after me.
[148:32.45]Burrito?
[148:33.11]What?
[148:38.01]Strike his back.
[148:38.81]I'm trying!
[148:40.87]It didn't even hit me.
[148:42.27]It didn't work.
[148:59.16]He doesn't know where I am.
[149:05.78]Oh, I did it.
[149:06.22]I got him.
[149:09.58]He was even looking over his shoulder like he was backing out of a parking spot.
[149:13.06]Like he was turned looking straight back.
[149:17.85]How do you know my name?
[149:20.41]I know many things about you.
[149:22.75]I am proud of you, my son.
[149:25.86]Wait, son?
[149:27.66]Brother?
[149:28.68]What does that mean?
[149:29.36]I'm your father.
[149:30.68]I'm your brother.
[149:33.22]I'm your sister.
[149:34.16]The most basic of all twists.
[149:37.79]Three in a row.
[149:54.80]800 years ago.
[149:58.14]It took you and I, a son and his father to end this centuries long bloodshed.
[150:12.73]No.
[150:16.05]I've killed my father with my own hands.
[150:20.75]And and probably my brother.
[150:25.04]That's why I asked her to send me that hasn't been confirmed yet, so you know.
[150:33.07]But father.
[150:35.85]You were right.
[150:39.07]You and I. Father and son, we put an end to this long battle.
[150:47.16]Together.
[150:48.70]We stopped the bloodshed.
[150:57.09]okay okay guys I have to do it again with another character I have to it's not it's gonna not take I'm gonna do a very good weapon
[151:31.32]Explain why.
[151:32.16]I don't know.
[151:38.60]I don't know.
[151:43.60]Burrito.
[151:45.24]Wait, we didn't even do VR mode.
[151:48.14]That's God.
[151:49.06]We haven't even done VR mode.
[151:52.43]Burrito.
[151:55.35]Stop.
[151:56.51]Stop.
[151:58.13]That's enough.
[152:01.21]we've been in the drive-thru for hours everybody wants me to move to siren and I can't wait to see all the people that say go back to Bushido blade oh it's gonna be it's gonna be rich
[152:36.22]Alright, just one boss.
[152:37.42]As you.
[152:38.28]And I'm going to use... Hold on, don't worry.
[152:43.81]We're almost done.
[152:45.13]We're almost done.
[152:45.85]Don't worry.
[152:47.13]Broadsword.
[152:47.71]We're almost done.
[153:01.84]And then we'll play... Cybern.
[153:08.72]Well, this is awful.
[153:10.44]Why would they put a wireframe here?
[153:12.14]Of all the things that don't deserve a punch-out style wireframe, it's this game.
[153:26.60]What information are they conveying to me?
[153:34.71]I don't know if that's my body, my stomach, or... Alright, let's go.
[153:53.23]Look, I'm gonna... Okay.
[153:55.03]My final take on the Bushido series?
[153:58.21]That's pretty cool.
[153:59.00]It was great.
[154:01.09]It's a fun game.
[154:02.95]Especially when you play, when you played this game two player.
[154:07.04]It was really, really, really fun because it was so easy for someone to die.
[154:10.35]It was great.
[154:13.47]You understand?
