[00:28.97]Give me one second.
[00:30.89]One second.
[00:31.35]We're back.
[00:32.13]Starting soon.
[01:50.77]wait what okay hi good uh good afternoon everybody we're starting a little early today just a little
[02:20.87]No big deal.
[02:25.63]Make a tweet.
[02:26.13]We have a new emote, as I'm sure you've all seen.
[02:34.27]UK-friendly stream, yeah.
[02:37.11]Pretty much.
[02:43.84]Nice, a little early.
[02:44.76]Nice troll.
[02:45.38]Yeah, so we're making up for all the times I've been late.
[02:47.86]So if I've been late, like...
[02:51.38]Let's just say I was late.
[02:53.70]Like seven times.
[02:55.76]In the last, like, two weeks.
[02:56.92]Or three weeks, right?
[02:57.56]I'm talking about being like half an hour, 20 minutes late, 15 minutes late here or there.
[03:01.91]Like an hour late here or there.
[03:04.91]Well, like, it... We're like seven hours early.
[03:07.83]So I made up all that time, all those 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 50 minutes, 60 minutes, two hours.
[03:12.30]Has been all combined into this makeup.
[03:16.32]But, let's go.
[03:21.82]99.
[03:23.22]Weirdly enough.
[03:25.09]Level 99.
[03:27.23]jermaMars is not... It's not even Mars.
[03:31.63]It's just suntan.
[03:32.87]It's just Jerma tan.
[03:36.03]But I'm not sure I want to change it because it's so stupid.
[03:39.63]It's just like a shitty close-up of the other one.
[03:42.99]But for some reason, I kind of like it.
[03:47.36]I don't hate it.
[03:52.65]I've missed whole days before.
[03:54.09]No, but I've pushed those streams forward to other days.
[03:57.86]If I've missed a live stream, I've streamed a different day that's not on the schedule.
[04:04.00]But... We're going to go... We're going to do a couple things today.
[04:10.64]But first, let me just make sure everything's set here.
[04:17.88]Let me do this.
[04:18.52]Wait, what?
[04:21.49]Uh-huh, there's that.
[04:24.91]Here we go.
[04:27.73]That needs to be dropped down a little right there.
[04:29.39]There we are.
[04:33.43]Okay.
[04:34.75]So, we're going to do some co-op stuff today.
[04:36.43]We're going to do some co-op shenanigans.
[04:39.59]I might try to attempt a boss or two.
[04:43.33]We'll see, right?
[04:43.83]Dragon.
[04:47.43]Dragon.
[04:50.21]No, I'm not attempting the dragon right now.
[04:58.48]I just want to keep going forward.
[05:02.20]I almost forgot about you.
[05:03.38]But I didn't.
[05:06.61]Upgrade another useless weapon.
[05:07.83]That sounds fun.
[05:09.69]We're done with the joke.
[05:11.63]I got really angry last night.
[05:13.37]Because I threw a ton of stuff in the trash.
[05:19.11]I want to go touch the egg.
[05:24.99]I want to go to the next area.
[05:25.97]Because I was told that wasn't necessarily true.
[05:37.41]That if I touch the egg, I can't come back to fight the dragon.
[05:47.26]The swear jar is currently on the ground over here.
[05:51.06]The ground is now the swear jar.
[05:57.40]Don't touch that egg.
[05:59.56]I'm touching the egg.
[06:01.32]I want to go to the next zone.
[06:02.26]I want to go to the inside the embryo.
[06:04.49]That's the next area, right?
[06:09.81]Yeah, let's go in the embryo.
[06:13.29]I'm going to get to the new area, and it's going to go... Embryo City!
[06:17.67]Watch.
[06:17.89]Apparently not.
[06:24.82]What happens if I just, like, start swinging at this lady?
[06:32.22]Uh-oh.
[06:41.17]This is, uh, taking her a long time to wake up.
[06:47.73]Nice job, you broke the time machine.
[06:49.39]Uh-oh, it's gonna... Oh, God.
[06:57.08]Here we go, new zone.
[07:04.22]New zone.
[07:06.64]Over easy city.
[07:14.91]Sunny side up-ville.
[07:19.41]Hey, I'll take him scrambled.
[07:23.73]She's dead.
[07:28.62]Wait, did I just go forward in time?
[07:33.92]I think I did.
[07:39.51]Holy shit.
[07:41.73]This is really cool.
[07:44.62]Damn.
[07:50.47]They beat the boss.
[07:51.37]That's the last boss of Dark Souls.
[07:53.87]I'm actually kind of curious what the final boss of the entire series is going to be.
[07:59.77]What's it going to be?
[08:02.48]I'll tell you right now.
[08:03.88]I swear to God.
[08:04.76]Here's what I'm going to tell you guys right now.
[08:06.10]If the final boss of Dark Souls, the entire series of Dark Souls...
[08:11.23]Is a guy that's on fire.
[08:12.57]It's like the Lord of Cinder again.
[08:13.77]I'm going to be real mad.
[08:16.33]If we get like Gwyn 3, I'm actually going to be upset.
[08:22.71]Let's see.
[08:31.08]Huge area.
[08:31.68]This has to be... Maybe this is the new zone.
[08:37.80]Really a new...
[08:43.49]Is that Lothric?
[08:49.91]I think that might be Prince Lothric.
[08:52.83]Yeah, that's Lothric.
[09:00.28]You know, help me.
[09:10.27]He said the name of the series.
[09:12.07]It all comes full circle.
[09:14.95]Dark Souls.
[09:17.34]How funny would it be if he crawled up and he was just like... Thank you for playing Dark Souls.
[09:25.68]And then the credits are rolling at the final boss.
[09:29.51]Nobody does that anymore.
[09:31.09]Can we just briefly touch upon that?
[09:32.71]Has anybody ever done that?
[09:35.42]That's mine.
[09:36.75]You can't have that, by the way.
[09:37.61]This is a verbal patent.
[09:39.91]I'm going to make a video again that has an extremely tear-jerking ending and a ton of crazy shit's happening and credits are rolling in the last boss fight.
[09:53.07]Oh, God.
[09:57.44]LOL.
[09:57.76]Very funny joke.
[10:01.72]That would be very distracting.
[10:02.90]No.
[10:03.04]No, it wouldn't.
[10:07.17]Life sucks, the video game.
[10:08.45]Oh, there's the big brother.
[10:15.21]No one does that thing that no one ever did anymore.
[10:19.55]So I have to fight one of those old guys?
[10:20.89]Okay.
[10:22.60]No, don't be Gwyn.
[10:25.50]Don't be a Lord of Cinder.
[10:30.50]What's he gonna be?
[10:36.16]It's the zombie from Resident Evil 1.
[10:41.81]It's gonna fucking... Wait a minute.
[10:44.29]Hold on a second.
[10:47.59]Who is that?
[10:49.37]Whoa.
[11:05.89]Slave Knight Gale is the final boss of Dark Souls.
[11:11.27]Or maybe not.
[11:12.05]No way.
[11:12.63]I don't know.
[11:13.15]I'm pleased to believe this.
[11:17.45]Okay.
[11:18.92]This got skewered.
[11:20.78]Holy shit.
[11:23.46]Let me just heal.
[11:32.50]He's like really cool actually.
[11:37.38]I can't wait till he turns into Bowser.
[11:40.54]That doesn't give you very much time to do a visceral attack to him, does it?
[12:01.12]Wow!
[12:01.44]He does a weird move like... Maybe backstab?
[12:09.03]I don't know what that means.
[12:15.83]Ooh!
[12:16.67]Okay.
[12:17.71]So he screams and does that that many times.
[12:24.46]Shit!
[12:27.10]He has a lot of health too.
[12:31.87]Need to figure out what he does for a pattern.
[12:33.83]Did I get hit by it again?
[12:35.05]No, I didn't.
[12:38.04]That first swing is going to take a lot of getting used to.
[12:51.77]Okay.
[12:54.45]I would actually be surprised if he had more than one phase, because he has a lot of health.
[13:01.40]Oh god, here it goes.
[13:05.46]Okay.
[13:11.94]Shit.
[13:12.60]Nah.
[13:14.12]Am I hitting him with a toothpick?
[13:17.14]No, I have the katana.
[13:18.06]He just has a lot of health.
[13:21.20]What the fuck?
[13:30.98]That delayed swing.
[13:32.64]He has a lot of delayed movement.
[13:49.01]Oh boy, I'm dead.
[13:50.35]Oh, he just barely missed me.
[13:55.78]What's he doing now?
[13:56.40]What are you doing?
[13:56.96]What are you doing?
[14:01.10]Starting to get the hang of it, though.
[14:07.23]Starting to, at least.
[14:10.63]Oh, shit.
[14:21.19]Heal, please!
[14:26.50]Fuck.
[14:29.85]I'm in trouble.
[14:30.61]I'm in deep trouble.
[14:37.29]Honestly, if I get the pattern down, this guy won't be that bad.
[14:39.69]Unless he has, like, fucking five phases, which I'm sure he does.
[14:49.10]Nope.
[14:50.16]Yeah.
[14:50.76]Okay.
[14:51.34]Here we go.
[14:52.42]Here comes phase two.
[14:53.31]This is where he turns into a giant demon.
[14:59.93]I hope his health bar doesn't fill up though, that would be... That would be kind of... That would be scary.
[15:15.09]Huh?
[15:16.57]He said it again.
[15:18.81]First try.
[15:21.43]Now he turns into the real boss.
[15:30.99]He's gonna get the soul, he's gonna have the hooly moan- the ho- the ho- the holy mo- I can't even say the word, the moonlit blade!
[15:40.21]Oh, crap.
[15:44.34]He's smoky.
[15:45.86]He's a little smoky.
[15:46.90]Here comes the credits.
[15:52.38]He kinda just looks like a shitty superhero.
[15:54.10]When did he get a crossbow?
[15:56.22]By the way, I have this.
[16:06.59]I think I can do... I think I just gotta get him to phase two.
[16:08.91]I think I can do this.
[16:19.50]I went in there not really being that prepared and... What the hell is going on here?
[16:26.02]Huh?
[16:27.18]Why does my controller get unplugged?
[16:29.18]What the fuck is this?
[16:33.79]Uh...
[16:38.29]Hello?
[16:41.19]Alright, that was weird.
[16:46.74]I wonder if he's a... I didn't take a Blossom, I'm gonna Ember.
[16:56.48]And like in real Kojima style.
[16:59.16]They fuck with your controllers and stuff.
[17:03.30]I wonder if he is... Susceptible to anything in particular.
[17:10.02]We'll just, like, magic.
[17:12.86]We'll try it.
[17:13.56]Just for fun.
[17:14.54]I'm starting to get the hang of it, so... Let's just reverse the fog and try it again.
[17:22.40]Where is he?
[17:25.44]He's not just, like, right here?
[17:26.88]Oh, there he is.
[17:27.44]He's like, I'm coming to get you!
[17:29.22]Here you are!
[17:29.76]I found you over the hill!
[17:30.93]Hey!
[17:41.18]I just got so greedy that was dumb.
[17:42.84]I blew it already, oh well.
[17:48.14]I may have blown it already.
[18:14.32]I actually can't tell if it's doing more or less.
[18:18.30]Oh, come on.
[18:19.92]The worst feature in every Dark Souls game.
[18:22.12]The stupid kick.
[18:40.05]I'm gonna heal.
[18:56.58]Come on, phase two, let's do it.
[18:58.02]Oh, got close.
[19:07.88]Shit, thought he was gonna go to phase two right there.
[19:26.45]Thought wrong.
[19:33.26]Phase 2.
[19:35.42]Why is he on phase 2?
[19:36.22]I'm like, what the fuck is happening right here?
[19:44.70]Didn't he have, like, much higher health last time?
[19:49.61]I'm very confused right now.
[19:50.99]Okay.
[19:51.65]Let's do it.
[19:54.85]Why did you... Oh yeah, there he is.
[20:00.78]Come on, buddy!
[20:06.93]Oh, I hate having to relearn whole new movesets!
[20:15.20]Oh god.
[20:31.50]Shit Okay, so far so good Back it up
[20:55.09]No, don't cross-ball me.
[21:03.01]Oh, shit.
[21:14.47]Alright, we gotta be really careful here.
[21:28.48]Come on, Gwen!
[22:01.54]Come on Gwen!
[22:01.80]What's going on?
[22:05.18]What the fuck is this?
[22:07.94]What the fuck is this?
[22:08.94]Drink it!
[22:11.90]That thing sucks!
[22:13.30]Holy shit, that thing sucks!
[22:16.79]That beer sucks!
[22:29.37]Oh!
[22:29.85]Oh, what's he doing?
[22:44.70]No!
[23:16.58]Oh, I just tried to... Okay, I'll get him.
[23:29.77]I'll get him.
[23:32.85]I'll get him this time.
[23:34.45]I'll get him this time.
[23:35.01]You know why we're going to get him this time, ladies and gentlemen?
[23:38.29]I'll tell you why we're going to get him this time.
[23:42.39]I'll tell you why we're gonna get him this time.
[23:44.60]I'll tell you why.
[23:45.24]We're gonna put on the fucking facecam for this one.
[23:48.46]This is the one right here, and I'm gonna tell you why, exactly why.
[23:50.90]We're gonna get it right fucking here.
[23:53.84]I'll show you.
[23:55.22]You'll see.
[23:58.35]Okay.
[24:00.21]Here we go.
[24:01.55]Got my headphones in.
[24:03.23]I got my magic weapon.
[24:04.19]I've got my ember.
[24:05.25]I'm gonna ember this up, and we're gonna get going here.
[24:08.93]I'll give you the exact reason why.
[24:11.78]It's desync.
[24:12.36]Don't even fucking matter.
[24:15.64]Don't even matter.
[24:16.18]Hold on.
[24:18.76]Let me just get my shit queued up here.
[24:26.65]Oh, my phone's fucking broken.
[24:29.17]Oh my god, iPhone.
[24:30.31]You suck.
[24:35.07]Okay.
[24:36.53]Here's how we're gonna do this.
[24:39.71]Doesn't even matter if I'm de-synced, because we're gonna get a little bit of fucking positive encouragement here.
[24:43.09]Okay, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:47.00]This is where we get the fucking victory.
[24:51.24]What you're about to hear is encouragement and praise with cheering applause just for you.
[24:58.97]For me.
[24:59.79]Acknowledging you for a variety of reasons.
[25:05.07]If there is a situation that does not apply to you, just listen.
[25:10.30]We want to see how you feel.
[25:15.00]So sit back.
[25:17.02]Get ready.
[25:19.48]Here it comes.
[25:21.62]Come on!
[25:27.10]We want to thank you for all your hard work.
[25:29.51]Give me my hard work!
[25:35.40]You're the one who steps up and gets things done around here.
[25:38.14]I'm the one who gets things done around here.
[25:42.08]You keep your word.
[25:43.82]You deliver what you promise.
[25:45.90]And then you go the extra mile.
[25:47.70]I do.
[25:52.05]You're doing a great job.
[25:54.45]A great job.
[25:58.93]This is sick.
[26:02.82]If anyone asks, we'll tell them!
[26:04.62]A great job!
[26:07.07]I'm doing a great job!
[26:33.91]I'm gonna do a great job right now, I swear to God.
[26:39.30]Is that it?
[26:40.50]No, I need more encouragement.
[26:42.52]Where's my encouragement?
[26:43.56]It's gone.
[26:45.46]I don't know if I can beat this boss without the encouragement, guys.
[26:49.76]It's gone.
[26:57.09]I thought there was more to this.
[26:59.19]There is more.
[26:59.93]It's coming back.
[27:06.28]You're probably wondering why we have asked you here today.
[27:12.10]We want to tell you that we have faith in you.
[27:15.25]And we know you can do it.
[27:20.81]We know you've got everything it takes to accomplish whatever your heart desires.
[27:28.96]That dream you're going for.
[27:30.86]That career you want.
[27:32.80]That recognition you're seeking.
[27:35.87]It is yours!
[27:41.19]Just listen.
[27:42.51]Everyone agrees.
[27:46.72]Everyone agrees.
[27:48.10]We're on your side.
[27:50.36]We're here for you.
[27:52.34]We believe in you.
[27:56.67]We believe in you.
[28:06.34]Come on Gwen.
[28:32.66]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[28:38.33]Holy shit, that was so lucky.
[28:41.93]Here comes the explosion.
[28:42.69]I need the cheers right now.
[28:48.92]You guys got to give them to me.
[28:49.74]I know you know this, but I want to say this.
[29:05.35]No matter what has ever happened in my life, you have always been there for me.
[29:11.87]And that's the greatest gift anyone could ever receive.
[29:15.59]The greatest gift anyone could ever give!
[29:23.42]You've got the biggest heart of anyone I know!
[29:26.97]I do!
[29:27.83]Look at love in the dictionary, and there's your picture!
[29:43.67]Thank you, my friend.
[29:44.35]Come on!
[29:44.59]He's here for me!
[29:46.49]Just kill him!
[30:14.98]Come on!
[30:15.42]Cheers to me!
[30:19.24]Cheers to me!
[30:25.52]Hooray!
[30:26.34]Hooray for me!
[30:29.12]He did it!
[30:32.90]Yes!
[30:38.72]Oh!
[30:43.86]Hooray.
[30:44.30]Hooray.
[30:46.86]There's even more.
[30:49.20]There's even more.
[30:50.38]Congratulations.
[30:51.52]You did it.
[30:53.46]You didn't let anyone or anything stop you.
[30:57.16]All your hard work has paid off.
[31:00.46]You knew where you were headed and you kept walking a straight line toward that goal.
[31:05.95]You took the obstacles and made them rungs on a ladder.
[31:09.73]And now success is yours.
[31:15.25]And it's all because of your commitment to yourself.
[31:17.21]It's all because of the commitment to myself!
[31:19.03]You earned it!
[31:19.89]You deserve it!
[31:20.41]I deserve this!
[31:21.47]Feels good, doesn't it?
[31:24.07]Success is yours!
[31:27.99]Oh my god!
[31:37.60]Wow, that fucking timer.
[31:45.95]That's fucking funny.
[31:52.81]Alright, turn this shit off.
[31:54.49]Turn this shit off.
[32:00.63]Well... Okay, that... That happened.
[32:04.11]Ugh.
[32:16.96]Alright, we're taking this off.
[32:18.24]Because it's out of sync.
[32:23.57]Well, I'm glad you guys got to see that.
[32:25.23]That was fucking ridiculous.
[32:30.35]Thank you, Crunchy, for the 50 bucks.
[32:33.55]It's the easiest $50 I've ever given up.
[32:36.73]Well, thank you so much.
[32:40.06]That's very, very kind of you.
[32:42.12]Also, thank you to Peak24 for the 10 bucks.
[32:44.36]You made them rungs on a ladder.
[32:47.94]Thank you so much.
[32:49.36]Oh, God.
[32:49.76]Mr. Kool-Aid.
[32:50.42]50 bucks.
[32:53.70]Says, amazing.
[32:55.44]I'm crying.
[32:56.32]There's no way I could have fucking queued that up correctly.
[32:59.75]That was fucking ridiculous.
[33:01.71]Legit, the guy says congratulations at the very end of that whole thing.
[33:07.04]That was probably so loud that it was worth it.
[33:13.01]But thank you, though.
[33:13.71]Thank you, guys.
[33:14.49]Mr. Kool-Aid, crunchy.
[33:17.23]Peak 24 for the 10 bucks.
[33:19.36]Also, Dr. Recommended gave like 11 bucks.
[33:22.22]Thank you so much.
[33:23.72]They say cheer.
[33:25.74]During that whole thing, Danger Illustrated gave 5 bucks.
[33:27.90]This is so surreal, man.
[33:29.08]I'm losing it.
[33:30.70]Jake Ben gave 3 bucks.
[33:32.24]Cheer, cheer, cheer.
[33:32.98]Great job.
[33:36.08]Thank you again, everybody.
[33:37.18]Marble Shark gave 5 bucks.
[33:39.02]Mr. Kool-Aid gave 4 bucks as well.
[33:40.64]They say great job, great job.
[33:43.30]You can do it.
[33:45.12]I'm trying.
[33:45.60]I'm trying to do it, and I did it.
[33:47.02]Thank you.
[33:48.76]Thank you for the $5 Irish guy in a tree.
[33:50.16]Thank you for the $20 Irish guy in a tree.
[33:51.62]Do you remember to play Dark Souls myself?
[33:55.67]Good luck.
[33:55.99]I'm off to play Dark Souls myself.
[33:57.23]Good luck.
[33:57.51]Well, good luck.
[33:59.53]It was fun.
[34:02.03]Yep, my ears are sore.
[34:08.93]I turned that way down, too.
[34:10.70]That's the crazy thing.
[34:13.89]I dropped that by so much.
[34:15.36]That must be so actually loud.
[34:18.24]It's so funny.
[34:19.72]Thank you guys for all your donations though.
[34:21.60]That's much appreciated.
[34:23.70]So, with that we have a couple things we can clean up here in the DLC.
[34:29.83]What is my guy doing?
[34:32.91]I'm tired after that one.
[34:35.27]Oh man.
[34:38.93]That shit, like, there was some points of that that was just so fucking funny.
[34:42.99]When he's telling me how many friends I have, he's like, you have so many friends.
[34:47.17]Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[34:50.21]How does he know that?
[34:52.55]How does he know that that's the case?
[34:54.76]That guy doesn't know how many friends I have.
[34:57.72]What does he mean?
[35:03.80]You have so many friends.
[35:09.09]That was a very, very fun boss, though.
[35:13.42]I'm glad that they ended the series on... That kind of encounter.
[35:19.16]Where it was hard, and it was very, very exhilarating, but it wasn't... I feel like that dragon is, like, fucking impossible.
[35:26.66]They must have just thrown that dragon in to be like, well, fuck everybody, fuck you, good luck.
[35:32.52]Because that guy is not even close to the difficulty of that fucking dragon.
[35:42.93]One more boss.
[35:43.65]One more boss.
[35:44.21]Actually, I want to explore a couple things.
[35:45.89]What did I just get?
[35:49.59]Soul of Slave Knight Gale.
[35:51.01]One of the Twisted Souls.
[35:52.39]This is just his soul.
[35:53.53]I got two items, though.
[35:57.35]Didn't I get two things?
[36:00.07]I was too busy laughing at the fucking cheers to you guy.
[36:05.97]Next up, Dark Souls Andromeda.
[36:09.92]What did I get?
[36:11.36]Blood of the Dark Soul.
[36:12.26]There it is.
[36:14.16]Blood of the Dark Soul that seeped from the hole within Slave Knight Gael, used as pigment by his lady in Ariandel to depict a painted world.
[36:22.60]When Gael came upon the Pygmy Lords, he discovered that their blood had long ago dried and so consumed the Dark Soul.
[36:30.17]Do I have to go to the painting place?
[36:32.67]Okay, I'll do that.
[36:35.09]Let me go level up first.
[36:41.20]Co-opping the dragon doesn't help either.
[36:43.40]Everyone dies instantly and you're left with a dragon with more health.
[36:50.88]That sucks so bad.
[36:55.08]Where is it?
[36:58.42]Let's write Ariandel Chapel, right?
[37:00.88]Yeah, the chapel.
[37:05.54]That was a good cap on the series, I think.
[37:08.17]I liked that boss.
[37:09.03]That boss was just difficult enough and just satisfying enough to fight.
[37:13.91]Nothing that guy did felt unfair.
[37:17.11]Maybe, like, maybe the one thing that may have been potentially unfair is that big explosion.
[37:26.04]Why is this place on fire?
[37:26.96]What the fuck?
[37:33.66]Anyways, what I was gonna say is the... When he does that big explosion of those, like, homing bomb things that just fly everywhere.
[37:46.49]Did I set it on fire?
[37:48.67]What is she still doing in here?
[37:51.49]Uh, sweetheart.
[37:53.39]I think you should probably leave this building.
[37:57.68]Give blood of the dark soul.
[38:00.60]Uh...
[38:01.90]I guess, right?
[38:03.14]Alright, yeah.
[38:03.62]Tell me the name.
[38:06.06]Share your name.
[38:07.78]I don't even know what my name is.
[38:11.86]Okay, share your name.
[38:13.57]Well, it's going to be a really bad...
[38:33.26]My name is like Frogman.
[38:40.36]Burbo.
[38:43.88]That was her uncle.
[38:48.42]The painted world of Frogman.
[38:53.04]The painted world of Frogman.
[38:55.72]Is that who this is?
[38:56.56]This is Frogman, right?
[38:58.34]But we can very easily tell by taking the helmet off.
[39:04.12]Yep.
[39:04.88]Yeah, that's Frogman, alright.
[39:09.71]Frogman, or for you, uh, Trailer Park Boy fans.
[39:14.45]The guy that talks like this, the guy that owns the place, the guy that can't believe that, can you believe what Ricky did today?
[39:19.29]Ricky, Ricky, get over here!
[39:20.85]What's his name?
[39:21.29]And they're like, shut up, idiot, shut up, dumb fucking idiot, idiot guy.
[39:25.84]I hate that guy.
[39:27.10]One day I'll kill that guy.
[39:28.34]I swear to God.
[39:28.84]I promise you that.
[39:30.36]I promise you that.
[39:31.60]Alright.
[39:32.88]Let's not do trailer park boys anymore.
[39:40.78]Leahy.
[39:41.24]That's who it is.
[39:41.77]Leahy.
[39:41.99]Let's put this back on.
[39:49.69]Mr. Leahy.
[39:57.95]For fuck's sake, Ricky, what are you thinking?
[40:01.43]You think you can just sit out here drinking all day and be a dickhead?
[40:05.02]Shut up, idiot.
[40:05.58]I hate you.
[40:06.36]You're a dumb idiot guy.
[40:11.66]Alright, so here's what we're going to do.
[40:14.16]There's a new PvP zone.
[40:15.16]I might as well just put a password on it and just fuck it around, right?
[40:17.20]After I do this.
[40:17.64]I'm going to level up a couple times and we'll do a little PvP.
[40:36.42]Medeir.
[40:37.08]We'll try Medeir.
[40:40.73]Your impressions aren't very good.
[40:41.99]Well, I'm not trying to do an impression.
[40:44.73]I'm just trying to say, like, I'm just doing mannerisms.
[40:47.03]I'm very good at mannerisms.
[40:49.29]Not necessarily vocal impressions.
[40:51.90]I pick up on mannerisms quite well.
[40:54.58]And if you don't believe that,
[40:58.71]And that you're free to believe whatever you want.
[41:01.01]I can't force you to believe anything.
[41:03.17]But what I can do.
[41:04.91]Let's take this boss soul up here.
[41:07.29]And see what... Let's see what the final... Boss of all of Dark Souls has for boss weapons.
[41:15.55]Gale's Greatsword.
[41:16.77]Ooh.
[41:21.61]Leap in any direction slamming the greatsword to the ground.
[41:23.65]Then follow with normal attack for a large spinning slash.
[41:29.97]Going back to strength.
[41:34.39]What's the other one?
[41:36.53]Repeating crossbow.
[41:41.23]I feel bad for all the people that want to use crossbows in this game.
[41:43.61]That they have to get to the very end of the entire game.
[41:47.88]The last boss of the whole game.
[41:51.10]To get a weapon that they might want to use.
[41:52.54]I understand...
[41:58.21]Here's the one thing that I wish they would do in Dark Souls.
[42:01.65]I wish, they never did it, and I can understand maybe why they didn't do it, but here, hear me out.
[42:06.74]When you beat the game, when you kill a boss, and you collect its boss soul, I think you should be able to, like, save that, the fact that you had the boss soul, and if you want to start, like, a new character, be able to unlock it, like, I could, like, buy this if I made a new character.
[42:29.45]Because if you don't want to do New Game+, it is meaningless to be able to do this.
[42:34.55]And I know you just take it in New Game+, and you just do the whole game again anyways, but I would like to play with a lot of these weapons, maybe not have to wait until 75% of the way through the game.
[42:46.34]But let me unlock this, if I get the boss soul.
[42:49.56]Let me just buy it.
[42:54.11]Let me be able to make a new character and go to the vendor and buy this.
[42:59.86]I know that's called New Game Plus, but if I want to make a brand new character, I mean... Sometimes I do that.
[43:05.19]I like to do that.
[43:05.85]I like to make brand new characters.
[43:06.99]It's fun.
[43:10.15]You can summon a friend and have him drop it for you.
[43:15.24]It's PvP.
[43:16.04]Yeah, I guess that's true as well.
[43:20.66]But sometimes I look at some of these and I'm like, you know, that's kind of cool, but I wish I didn't have to play through half the game to be able to get it.
[43:28.45]I'd like to start with it.
[43:32.39]I don't think I want either one of those.
[43:33.45]I think I'm just going to crush it.
[43:38.63]There you go.
[43:43.81]Medeir's sword is worth the pain of the fight if you like katanas.
[43:50.11]Yeah, we're going to try to do a Mario Party thing against Medeir.
[43:53.07]Let me just level up a few times and we'll get some people.
[43:57.43]We'll try to get a few people in here.
[43:59.75]Have a little bit of co-op fun for maybe an hour or so.
[44:05.78]The Medeir Katana is legit.
[44:09.50]And hell yeah, man.
[44:10.16]I'm going to try it.
[44:12.56]I might not be able to do it on stream, but I'll try to do it off stream.
[44:18.79]Or should I get that sword?
[44:23.27]We're going to Medeir.
[44:27.71]Let's try to just dick around in PvP for a little while.
[44:36.04]I will end the stream with us trying to kill Medeir, like, two or three times.
[44:41.57]That sword is a good skill.
[44:42.71]Let's just see what it does.
[44:43.59]You know what?
[44:44.03]Who cares?
[44:45.15]I'm level 100.
[44:45.93]It's not, like, a big deal.
[44:46.81]Like, I'll be level 100.
[44:48.03]I don't need the souls.
[44:50.35]It's not like, oh, god, I'm so underleveled.
[44:52.47]Like, I kind of am, but who cares?
[44:58.72]If this is, like, the dark soul weapon, then I'd kind of like to see what it is.
[45:06.90]Let's just do it.
[45:07.42]Let's get the sword.
[45:09.38]Gale's great sword.
[45:10.30]Just get it.
[45:10.68]Let's see what it does.
[45:20.92]Let's see how it looks.
[45:21.88]Cool.
[45:25.67]It's actually fairly quick.
[45:27.25]It's not as slow as I thought.
[45:31.55]It's got like a stab for its R2.
[45:39.37]Okay, what about this one?
[45:41.33]Damn.
[45:43.25]You can combo that too.
[45:44.39]Let's try to do that.
[45:50.34]Ooh.
[45:51.82]Oh.
[45:51.94]I don't know.
[45:54.20]I kind of like this.
[45:57.48]I can follow it up with another one, right?
[46:00.60]How do I do the...
[46:09.21]Normal attack for a large spinning slash.
[46:14.15]Can I not do that because I don't have the right proficiency?
[46:23.81]That's damn cool.
[46:29.35]I don't know, guys.
[46:32.44]This thing is quick.
[46:40.42]It looks pretty deadly too.
[46:44.30]And it's fast as hell.
[46:49.74]I think we're gonna... I think I'm gonna do it.
[46:53.64]I'm gonna do it.
[46:55.88]We have enough to be able to do that.
[46:58.00]So, let's just try it.
[47:00.22]The game is pretty much over at this point.
[47:01.52]I'm just trying different things out.
[47:02.64]So, you know, whatever.
[47:04.98]Back to strength.
[47:05.66]Yeah, what are you making?
[47:10.48]Hot dogs?
[47:11.26]Yeah.
[47:11.76]You can try to eat those up before you leave.
[47:14.08]Yeah.
[47:14.68]Sounds good.
[47:15.20]I'll eat a dog.
[47:16.62]Okay, how many do you want?
[47:17.74]There's like seven left.
[47:20.30]I'll just... Just one for now.
[47:21.86]If I want another one, I can make it later.
[47:23.48]I'll do a two.
[47:23.90]We'll go with two.
[47:24.90]Okay, do you want it how you usually take it?
[47:26.72]Oh, yeah.
[47:27.00]Okay.
[47:27.86]Oh, yeah.
[47:30.08]Oh, yeah.
[47:30.52]Thank you.
[47:30.82]No problem.
[47:34.86]We're doing hot dogs.
[47:38.74]Mmm...
[47:40.89]Okay, let's do it.
[47:43.58]I always do this, and I'm fucking stupid.
[47:45.82]I need to know what the base stats for Dexterity is.
[47:48.33]I do this every time.
[47:51.77]Every time.
[47:53.93]What is the base stats?
[47:54.79]19 and 13.
[47:55.23]Okay, 13 Dexterity.
[48:08.50]I could go for a hot dog right about now.
[48:10.44]Everybody could go for a hot dog.
[48:12.30]Alright, we already have base 16, so that's not going to be a big deal.
[48:14.57]What do we got left? 35...
[48:33.72]I'll get this to 38, 38, 20, 40.
[48:36.48]I think that might be good.
[48:39.90]38, 38, 20, 40.
[48:40.36]I feel like I'm okay with that.
[48:48.61]Because this thing is pretty much a pure strength sword, right?
[48:55.72]I need more bite.
[48:57.16]I had only a 17 bite before.
[49:00.82]Whatever.
[49:03.44]I think that looks good.
[49:05.71]Game sucks.
[49:09.33]Game doesn't suck.
[49:10.07]80-20 perfect beef percentage.
[49:24.98]Mostly scales of strength.
[49:26.06]Yeah.
[49:29.98]Madea's gonna suck.
[49:35.82]That's a descaling in dex, really.
[49:37.88]Alright, soup.
[49:47.24]What do you think?
[49:47.98]No soup for you is going to be my Dark Souls 3 wiki.
[49:51.80]40 strength, 40 dex?
[49:53.26]Or should I do 40 strength?
[49:57.08]And like more... What do you think?
[49:58.34]40 strength, 40 hot dog.
[50:08.64]Need more vitality.
[50:09.30]I don't really have... I have two, pretty much one or two more points I can put in.
[50:18.20]40, 20.
[50:24.74]Depends on the weapon hold.
[50:25.58]Let me look it up.
[50:31.66]That looks alright.
[50:33.48]Plus, I'll put another point new endurance when I level up here.
[50:35.87]40, 20, 20.
[50:39.92]Seems more like a strength weapon than a hybrid.
[50:46.84]Why no twin great swords?
[50:48.02]The twin great swords really weren't that good.
[50:51.30]I think that's fine the way it is.
[50:53.32]I'm okay with this.
[50:54.78]I'm gonna confirm it.
[50:58.22]Do you want me to butter your roll?
[51:00.42]Um... I mean, if you're gonna do it to all of them, then yeah, sure.
[51:03.98]Thank you.
[51:07.08]Make sure I have enough vitality.
[51:08.16]I do.
[51:10.71]I had... Yeah, I do.
[51:12.89]Let's just confirm this shit.
[51:19.86]Let's take a look at it.
[51:25.93]That's 71% right now.
[51:27.49]That means I have to take off these dark gauntlets.
[51:34.42]Hmm.
[51:37.35]Not quite.
[51:38.09]Maybe at 69.
[51:41.21]69!
[51:42.33]Ha!
[51:53.61]I really do like this thing.
[51:57.55]Let's go level it up.
[51:58.93]I hope I have enough materials!
[52:01.91]Otherwise, this was... I didn't even think about that shit.
[52:10.15]Didn't even think about that.
[52:11.41]Do I have enough materials to do this?
[52:14.49]I know I have a slab.
[52:15.45]Do I have enough twinkling Titanite?
[52:18.78]Well, that's going to be a sad day if that ain't real.
[52:21.12]I hope so.
[52:24.32]Do I?
[52:26.08]Okay, I think I do.
[52:27.36]I think I just barely have enough.
[52:35.35]Yeah, I just had enough.
[52:36.15]Good.
[52:36.81]Tight Knight's Lab.
[52:37.53]This is it, guys.
[52:39.97]Bang.
[52:42.00]Can't be infused.
[52:42.66]268 plus 169.
[52:48.92]I'm 189.
[52:52.94]It's pretty good, considering how fast it is.
[52:54.75]I have enough materials.
[53:00.55]I'm so happy.
[53:03.41]Let's get rid of this.
[53:07.67]We're going for a straight-up cosplay here.
[53:10.71]Yeah, I got it all on.
[53:22.14]There I am.
[53:22.56]I'm this guy.
[53:23.92]Take a look.
[53:24.26]It's me.
[53:25.43]I'm the guy.
[53:25.93]Remember me?
[53:26.95]Don't accidentally kill the old lady.
[53:37.23]Dude, this thing is so good.
[53:40.09]I'm so happy I have this.
[53:41.17]Now I'm gonna fight the dragon.
[53:42.59]I don't want any help yet.
[53:43.37]268 plus 210.
[53:51.82]Take off that fucking life ring.
[53:54.68]I just did it.
[53:55.30]I don't know, man.
[53:55.92]Come on.
[54:05.87]Should I just get more dexterity?
[54:06.81]Let's just see if this does.
[54:12.21]That increases my damage.
[54:15.01]By, like, a little bit.
[54:18.97]That brings me to 500 AR.
[54:21.51]Way over that.
[54:22.87]Yeah, that brings me over 500 AR.
[54:23.75]Alright, let's level up one more time.
[54:32.04]And we're going to put this into, I believe it was endurance, right?
[54:40.01]Yeah.
[54:40.55]35, 35, 40, 20, 20.
[54:41.15]Let's go buy some stuff.
[54:55.73]Let's get like five of these.
[54:57.17]Let's get like five of these.
[55:03.05]and buy some dirty fingers too because they're gonna bring in some people after I try this once or twice where the dry do I think I already have one or two of them dried finger no actually I already have one okay 478 ar nice 500 ar
[55:31.01]It's close enough.
[55:32.35]Wait, what are you talking about?
[55:34.65]What are you guys talking about?
[55:37.11]268, plus, that's 2, 3, 4, 68, 78, 88, 9, like, what are you talking about?
[55:42.80]That's like 4, like, 99.
[55:44.88]We're fine.
[55:48.12]I got, like, 500.
[55:50.80]No, I need to just waste this money because I'm not going to get it back.
[56:00.95]How much should I think?
[56:05.35]Yeah, maybe just another.
[56:06.01]Yeah, just buy just fucking 12 of these.
[56:08.43]The last thing that's here is the dragon, and this is what hurts the dragon the most.
[56:12.25]Then just buy like 10 of these fucking.
[56:14.83]Who cares?
[56:15.75]Just buy them all.
[56:17.94]Alright, let's try to.
[56:18.68]I'm going to try to fight the dragon.
[56:20.70]I do want some fire resistance, though, and this doesn't really give very much, does it?
[56:26.31]Um... That gives good fire resistance.
[56:30.14]That doesn't weigh that much with... Actually, this is okay.
[56:37.18]Not great, but... Oh, Pontiff... I like Pontiff Knight.
[56:42.10]Pontiff Knight is lighter than that shit, too.
[56:46.52]Hmm, could do this one.
[56:49.44]Outrider, let's see.
[56:50.78]Well, I could keep the Wing Knight on.
[56:54.08]In fact, I might.
[56:57.27]66%.
[56:57.59]65.
[56:57.73]Let's see what else we got.
[57:06.88]68.
[57:07.52]Okay.
[57:10.02]Fashion Souls.
[57:10.74]Not against the hardest boss in the entire series.
[57:14.72]That's not gonna happen.
[57:16.34]We're doing defense souls at the hardest boss in the whole game.
[57:22.36]Just the way it is.
[57:23.56]There we go. 69.1%.
[57:27.73]Yeah, that's too much.
[57:32.86]I still have his hood on, don't worry.
[57:33.86]Alright, let's go.
[57:35.84]I'm gonna give it a try.
[57:37.76]One solid attempt.
[57:45.28]I need full Havel's armor.
[57:46.46]Yeah, hardest boss in the series.
[57:48.24]Yeah, I would say that.
[57:54.59]Nobody in Dark Souls 2...
[57:57.48]And look, okay, hold on.
[58:00.24]Um... I got, like, maybe, like, 40 or 50% of the way through Dark Souls 1.
[58:06.98]So... Mmm... I... Yeah, I can't really tell you that.
[58:12.10]Can't really say that that's true.
[58:14.49]But, at least in... Dark... Dark Souls 2 was... There wasn't... I don't remember a boss that really gave me that much trouble the way I died, like, more than 10 times.
[58:29.73]Ornstein and Smough.
[58:30.77]No, I have not.
[58:31.33]I did not fight Ornstein and Smough.
[58:32.59]That is correct.
[58:38.37]All these tiny little wings.
[58:48.96]Actually, you know who I had a lot of trouble with was Orphan, of course.
[58:53.58]And Bloodborne.
[58:55.08]I found him to be so, so horrible.
[58:59.13]Him and Ludwig.
[58:59.93]Fighting Ludwig for the first, like, time when you didn't know what he did.
[59:03.43]That was a solid, like, 15 attempts to beat Ludwig.
[59:12.16]But I remember Orphanacost was just my, like, made my brain hurt.
[59:16.92]Alright, let's try.
[59:17.48]I'm probably going to lose, but it's okay.
[59:19.96]We can try our new weapon.
[59:24.30]What?
[59:29.47]Here we go.
[59:31.33]I'm not going to use any items.
[59:32.67]Not yet.
[59:32.85]I gotta get used to it again.
[59:35.07]Hmm.
[59:35.19]Let's just pop him a couple better.
[59:52.39]193 on the log.
[59:52.77]That should do it good.
[60:15.76]Damn damn Yeah, I am gonna take an item
[60:33.47]Shit, that was easy
[61:14.00]I wonder if he has another phase.
[61:17.89]I wonder.
[61:18.23]That move right there is so hard to know if he's gonna do it.
[61:25.46]And he just does it instantly.
[61:27.32]There's no real tell.
[61:50.01]Slow down, buddy.
[61:58.95]Fire!
[61:59.21]What are you doing?
[62:08.63]Where is he?
[62:35.06]I gotta tell you, this weapon is so much better than anything I've ever used.
[62:38.18]I don't know what that is.
[62:58.43]What on Earth was that?
[63:01.79]Never saw that one.
[63:03.15]That's new.
[63:05.70]He's in phase two.
[63:06.34]That's what this is.
[63:08.40]Okay.
[63:12.02]Holy shit.
[63:12.78]That was a series of things that there was no way I was gonna get by them.
[63:23.40]Jesus.
[63:24.20]We just got like three times more difficulty.
[63:27.74]Oh no.
[63:30.73]Fuck this shit.
[63:34.47]Wow dude, like really That was a series of moves that There's nothing I can do I think I can do this by myself I really do
[64:05.02]Alright.
[64:06.28]How do you avoid that fire move?
[64:12.48]Do you have to be to his right, like my left?
[64:15.37]It's just so hard.
[64:18.35]You're in a position that you can't... There's nothing I can really do.
[64:24.49]Sometimes you're just in a spot where you can't really move around.
[64:28.15]That really stinks.
[64:29.89]But whatever.
[64:30.29]I'm going to do that again.
[64:33.95]You can block it with a shield?
[64:36.09]Oh god, somebody gave a hundred dollars.
[64:39.51]Yeah.
[64:40.73]Hold on.
[64:45.43]Uh, they say, uh, Backbiter, 835, hundred bucks.
[64:51.33]Thank you, back.
[64:52.39]Says, since you didn't beat him with the javelin yesterday, here's to hoping you can get him today.
[64:56.02]Well, thank you.
[64:57.68]I very much appreciate that.
[64:59.80]I'm gonna try.
[65:00.34]I'm gonna try my hardest.
[65:03.95]I'm going to run out of embers.
[65:05.95]No, I will not.
[65:06.67]What I'm going to do here is after this, I'm going to summon somebody.
[65:12.82]I'm going to do my co-op after this.
[65:18.54]Put on the encouragement speech.
[65:19.72]Can you use the resin?
[65:25.77]Which resin?
[65:26.55]I can't.
[65:27.83]It's a boss-all weapon.
[65:28.59]I don't think I can put anything on it.
[65:35.22]I did a fairly decent job right there, though, for trying him for the first time.
[65:38.28]I'm gonna do this again.
[65:40.64]Nice solid try.
[65:41.66]I feel like I can do this.
[65:43.61]I can let him... I'll get him to phase two again, at least.
[65:53.01]I forgot to stop.
[66:00.83]If he does get to me, I don't even try to help him.
[66:15.28]He's getting out of the way for me.
[66:18.92]He spins with the tail.
[66:19.60]Okay, now let's do it.
[66:20.14]Fire.
[66:20.28]Bad start, but it's okay.
[66:25.29]Getting a real bad start here.
[66:30.74]That was unfortunate.
[66:35.48]God damn, dude.
[66:37.36]He just has so many unpredictable moves.
[66:46.60]That one, like... It's just like... You have a tenth of a second before he does that Ultra Dash.
[67:01.26]Oh, that's so obnoxious, man.
[67:02.77]It really is.
[67:08.39]I know I can beat this guy.
[67:09.73]I do.
[67:15.51]A Black Knight shield nullifies it.
[67:16.79]I don't know if I have time to try to get a Black Knight shield right now.
[67:23.47]Screw the Ember.
[67:24.13]I'm doing it again.
[67:24.73]No crutches.
[67:27.79]Ember is a crutch right now.
[67:31.74]I need the motivation on him.
[67:36.04]He's so big and he goes off camera that you can't predict him.
[67:39.52]It's just... It's that one move gets... I don't think I've ever dodged that move.
[67:44.16]It gets me every time.
[67:45.98]Because you can see his back legs.
[67:48.48]He has so many different weird moves that he does from far away that you're trying to anticipate them.
[67:54.03]So when he does his back legs a little bit of purple, like goes right on his back legs, but it's like it's no time at all.
[68:15.28]Alright, let's go.
[68:17.30]All of my friends are here.
[68:22.91]He always starts with that.
[68:39.20]Fire.
[68:40.18]That ringer every time.
[68:41.20]About to fail.
[68:42.08]That was a bunch of free hits.
[68:57.81]Okay.
[68:57.95]I mean, I kind of can't do anything from the back here.
[69:05.84]I just have to dodge the tail.
[69:07.58]If I can make that happen...
[69:12.41]Let me see something here for a sec.
[69:15.39]Fire, that's fine.
[69:21.50]Why don't I just stay, like, right behind him?
[69:23.94]He doesn't really have an opportunity to move.
[69:32.73]Just have to dodge that move.
[69:33.97]Maybe I can just cheese that out.
[69:44.07]Stay, like, on his back legs.
[69:45.19]At least for the first part.
[69:49.37]I'm talking and I'm not getting hit.
[69:55.89]God.
[69:56.11]Fuck that move.
[69:56.85]Holy shit, I hate that move.
[70:05.17]Passion.
[70:07.55]That move just ain't fun.
[70:10.07]Not at all.
[70:10.57]Can't detail swipe.
[70:11.69]Nope.
[70:31.26]Stay on his butt.
[70:32.34]Come here.
[70:36.06]Come on.
[70:36.52]Oh, my God.
[70:37.94]Here comes a dash, right?
[70:39.04]Dash?
[70:40.24]No.
[70:48.36]I'm not so sure about this, though.
[70:49.72]Because now I'm like, I'm so hell-bent on trying to get behind him that I can't hurt him.
[70:57.13]It's just so sloppy and awkward to get where his tail is.
[71:09.90]I'm gonna get by the tail.
[71:17.08]When you get that close, you can just do that.
[71:20.31]I hate this boss.
[71:24.60]I find this boss extraordinarily annoying.
[71:26.76]I just do.
[71:35.34]It just feels too cheesy fighting this guy, it really does.
[71:39.02]He's just so huge.
[71:58.95]I'd much rather do what I was doing before.
[72:01.59]It's like dodge his crumpled swings.
[72:08.90]I just did more damage to him right there than I think I have the entire time I've been playing this.
[72:28.52]What am I doing?
[72:30.50]Alright.
[72:31.02]Gotta let him kill me.
[72:40.10]I love how when I'm trying just to die, he won't attack me.
[72:42.44]Oh my god.
[72:51.53]Can't wait to fight this on New Game Plus 6.
[72:55.15]Oh god, that would be so terrible.
[72:58.28]I'm going to take a pee break and I'm going to eat like a hot dog or something.
[73:01.31]I'll be right back.
[73:01.83]I'm just going to bring him down here.
[73:02.73]Oh, my God.
[73:04.19]Spinning in circles.
[73:05.49]Hold on.
[73:05.91]Hold on.
[73:06.27]Hold on.
[73:07.21]I'll be right back.
[75:55.76]Did I startle you guys?
[75:56.60]Did I scare anybody?
[75:58.82]I think I ran right into the screen.
[76:01.20]I got my hot dogs.
[76:05.05]These hot dogs are gonna be so good!
[76:06.45]This breathing is weird and uncomfortable.
[76:14.27]Alright, so here's what we're gonna do.
[76:16.57]Here's what we're gonna do.
[76:18.55]We're gonna turn this into a social eating stream.
[76:22.83]Where I summon like four people and you guys kill the dragon while I eat hot dogs.
[76:27.19]Sounds good.
[76:31.30]Does anybody have embers?
[76:33.08]By the way.
[76:35.32]Like soup, do you have embers?
[76:42.66]Oh, by the way, everybody say happy birthday to Kim.
[76:45.04]It's Kim's birthday.
[76:46.98]Uh, tomorrow.
[76:49.28]She's, uh... She turned 36!
[76:53.37]No.
[76:54.79]I have to say every birthday, if you will.
[77:00.57]Eating cam.
[77:08.56]Etalyx, are you like... Etalyx, where are you at?
[77:11.20]Do you have this DLC yet, Etalyx?
[77:12.48]Are you like here?
[77:22.57]Merry Christmas.
[77:23.33]Because I want to give the... I'm going to make it a password.
[77:30.21]Let's go with... I'm going to have to turn the camera off.
[77:35.75]Because I want to give this password to Soup.
[77:38.22]Haven't even beaten the vanilla game.
[77:47.92]Did I beat Mr. Dragon?
[77:48.78]I did not.
[77:52.32]I did not.
[77:55.57]Alright, 300 embers.
[77:56.73]Alright, soup.
[77:57.35]I'm going to give this password to you in private, soup.
[77:59.47]And then I'm going to wait until you get in.
[78:03.81]So, come over here where I am, soup.
[78:07.09]And use this password.
[78:08.47]Actually, I'm just going to put it in the mod.
[78:14.55]Hold on.
[78:15.03]Where's my phone?
[78:17.83]Where's my cell phone?
[78:18.49]I'm going to put it in the mod.
[78:20.71]Chat on the Discord, soup.
[78:26.05]Because I want to get you in here first.
[78:26.97]Okay, I'm going to put it in now.
[78:41.88]It's just going to be all lowercase.
[78:43.16]There we go.
[78:46.96]Wait until the screen turns off and then we'll get you in here.
[78:49.34]Because I need to actually make it that so nobody sees it.
[78:52.52]So, one second.
[78:58.80]By the way, soup, there is no number at the end of that, by the way.
[79:02.46]Because I can't put it in.
[79:07.69]Just the word.
[79:11.49]Just that word that I just put in there.
[79:14.55]I should be able to find you now.
[79:16.15]Sorry for the black screen, everybody.
[79:20.55]It's not embers.
[79:24.75]I think I might need to reload the area.
[79:26.25]Please!
[79:33.12]Just waiting for it to pop up.
[79:34.86]And actually, I can bring this back because I'm not on that screen anymore.
[79:39.87]Okay.
[79:46.57]I didn't turn this... Yeah, you guys can't see.
[79:48.51]Hey, look it.
[79:49.99]There he is.
[79:51.41]Jom's Viking.
[79:53.06]Okay, well, there's Soup.
[79:53.80]Let's see if we can get him in here.
[80:01.70]And then I will show it.
[80:06.08]Hopefully he can get in here.
[80:10.22]Yams.
[80:12.10]There he is!
[80:13.36]Hello!
[80:14.98]He's here.
[80:15.52]So I hope you guys are ready for this.
[80:18.09]Because we're going to get three people in here.
[80:20.99]As many as I can possibly summon.
[80:22.33]I have to use the finger, right?
[80:28.79]Where's my finger?
[80:34.00]Unlimited use, right?
[80:34.96]Where is it?
[80:38.08]I bought one.
[80:38.74]Maybe I bought it on... Did I not buy it on this character?
[80:42.12]Was it on the other character?
[80:44.28]I guess I didn't buy it.
[80:47.40]Hey!
[80:47.82]Thank you.
[80:51.94]And I must have bought it on the other character.
[80:53.48]Well, sorry.
[80:54.32]Sorry, you're going home.
[80:58.22]Let me take these two.
[80:59.04]Okay, thank you for the embers.
[81:00.18]But you're going to go home for a minute because I didn't buy it on this character.
[81:06.06]Thanks for playing.
[81:09.10]Hey.
[81:10.12]Hey.
[81:10.98]Thanks for playing, buddy.

[81:27.54]Yeah, we did.
[81:31.45]Okay, I'm gonna warn you guys.
[81:33.95]This joke... Is it gonna be a joke here?
[81:40.70]If you don't like when people eat on camera and make eating noises, mute the stream when we get into the boss area.
[81:53.15]Because this is a stupid fucking joke.
[81:55.65]By the way, thanks for the thousand dollars.
[81:57.39]Where's the finger?
[82:06.04]It's 2400.

[82:41.33]So, I'm gonna eat these hotdogs while you guys fight the dragon.
[83:01.13]Alright, where you at?
[83:05.79]Where you at, soup?
[83:11.45]I thought that was soup right there, I swear to God.
[83:13.47]I don't know why.
[83:14.93]That's a crunchy hot dog.
[83:21.65]That's not hot.
[83:22.33]There's chips there, too.
[83:27.76]Can I not see your sign anymore?
[83:31.74]Hey, soup.
[83:32.66]What's your sign, man?
[83:35.59]I'm being summoned as a blue.
[83:38.01]Oh, God.
[83:40.36]Let's take a bite.
[83:41.02]You know, I'm gonna eat another bite.
[83:47.46]These are good.
[83:54.06]Alright, let's do this.
[84:02.01]Let's go, baby.
[84:07.73]What's your zodiac sign?
[84:09.89]I'm a Virgo.
[84:14.22]Eat close to the mic and give us words of inspiration.
[84:16.66]No, people really don't like that.
[84:20.22]I've come to realize.
[84:20.88]Now I can understand that.
[84:23.61]I don't want to, like, disgust people by, like, crouching, like, ugh, yeah.
[84:29.07]Like, people really fucking hate that shit.
[84:36.24]I totally get it.
[84:37.38]That's why I'm warning you right now.
[84:39.68]I'm trying to give you guys as much of a warning as I can.
[84:41.46]This is going to be like a crunch fucking eat stream in a second.
[84:45.30]There it is.
[84:55.36]And then, once he's in here, we're opening it up to the public.
[84:59.65]Pretty much all I'm going to say here is good luck.
[85:01.61]I hope I don't crash the server that we're on.
[85:07.14]Once it's confirmed this hoop is in here.
[85:11.46]And... Okay.
[85:13.12]Ladies and gentlemen, the pat... Hold on, I think Mom's calling me.
[85:17.14]I can't talk right now, Mom.
[85:18.00]Sorry.
[85:18.70]I'm in the middle of doing this.
[85:19.92]Alright, here's the password.
[85:20.70]The password is... Vitamins.
[85:22.50]Go!
[85:23.80]Vitamins.
[85:28.69]The password is Vitamins.
[85:30.33]Go for it.
[85:35.17]I wonder how many signs it's going to shoot up.
[85:40.68]First-come, first-served basis, by the way.
[85:44.14]There's no rhyme or reason to this.
[85:45.50]Okay.
[85:47.55]Here for the DLC.
[85:48.69]I need the finger too, right?
[85:57.33]Okay.
[85:57.55]What about this one?
[86:03.01]I gotta be random about this.
[86:04.85]Hold on.
[86:05.25]What the hell?
[86:07.97]Dude, look at this guy.
[86:10.87]Alright, Jim.
[86:12.17]You can do... Okay.
[86:17.01]Vitamins?
[86:17.57]It's vitamins.
[86:18.17]Now you're going to turn the camera on.
[86:25.06]This is going to be disgusting, by the way.
[86:26.84]Like, I can't... I'm sorry about this in advance.
[86:30.54]We need to make this clear again.
[86:32.42]Very, very clear.
[86:33.28]It's going to be out of sync, by the way.
[86:35.87]It's going to be very out of sync.
[86:38.12]But we gotta be very clear about this.
[86:40.10]This is just a joke.
[86:41.52]I'm doing this one fucking time, I swear to God.
[86:44.95]So.
[86:46.43]Are we ready?
[86:49.83]Okay.
[86:50.85]I'm gonna eat like fucking hot dogs.
[86:55.41]Who's this guy?
[86:59.20]Just like fill the hallway.
[87:02.90]You know what, just get rid of this guy.
[87:04.95]No, not that guy.
[87:05.55]That poor guy.
[87:06.51]That guy just died bad.
[87:09.09]Let's just walk in the door.
[87:11.63]Just walk in the door.
[87:13.76]Forget him.
[87:15.00]Can we even walk in the door if he's here?
[87:18.22]I'm going for him.
[87:19.20]He's going to be my fucking special move.
[87:26.19]He's dead.
[87:28.17]We're fine.
[87:28.67]Let's go.
[87:31.51]Audio is out of sync.
[87:32.25]Yes, it is.
[87:33.81]It's very out of sync.
[87:34.69]Alright, everybody on.
[87:43.01]Everybody on.
[87:43.45]No stragglers.
[87:43.97]Come on.
[87:44.41]Everybody on.
[87:47.48]Just watch out for the guy that just invaded, because he's probably going to come down here.
[87:53.90]After me.
[87:55.98]Okay, wait, uh, well, alright, none of us did it.
[87:59.60]None of us did the thing we were supposed to do.
[88:01.20]I got, like, too distracted.
[88:03.30]It's on this side, right?
[88:05.52]No, it's on that side.
[88:06.40]Okay, none of us did it again.
[88:07.70]Alright, we're doing well.
[88:10.09]We're doing well here.
[88:13.35]He's just sitting there pointing.
[88:14.71]Alright, come on, we got one more guy that's down there needs to get it done.
[88:20.87]Alright, good.
[88:23.23]Alright, now we can't move.
[88:24.19]Alright, go, go, go, go, go.
[88:25.81]So, as you guys know, the challenge here... There's a little bit of a challenge here.
[88:29.71]I'm out of sync.
[88:30.31]It's okay.
[88:32.55]The challenge is... Everybody has to fight... Is there a guy right there?
[88:40.64]Did he actually follow us all the way down here?
[88:47.48]You guys have to kill the boss while I just eat hot dogs.
[88:50.00]That's just how it works.
[88:52.61]Get out of here.
[88:54.37]Hey, get out of here.
[88:55.35]We're like in the middle.
[88:56.09]Just go down.
[88:56.55]Just go down the hole.
[88:57.11]Go, go, go, go, go.
[88:57.77]Go down the hole quick.
[88:58.87]Get down the hole.
[89:00.63]Just go down.
[89:01.50]Forget this guy.
[89:02.10]Just go down the hole.
[89:05.98]If he wants to follow us, he can.
[89:09.36]I'm going in the hole.
[89:09.98]Alright, let's go.
[89:17.79]Nice work.
[89:18.65]You guys did it.
[89:21.26]Three, two, one, here we go.
[89:32.36]Get him!
[89:35.12]I command you, get him!
[89:36.38]Where is everybody?
[89:53.81]Oh
[90:27.11]Oh fuck!
[90:32.05]Oh, ow!
[90:33.98]What am I doing?
[90:34.58]You guys have to kill him.
[91:14.86]Alright, we're good.
[91:24.46]Come on!
[91:26.73]He only has like 95% of his health left.
[91:29.77]Do I have to do everything myself?
[91:38.29]Am I going to do everything myself?
[91:46.53]Oh, fuck.
[92:42.82]Why won't he hurt me?
[92:45.85]Like what the fuck?
[93:00.60]Alright, we're done.
[93:02.68]Finally.
[93:03.06]Now I'm gonna enjoy this other hot dog off camera.
[93:23.80]Estes is gone before the hot dog.
[93:27.63]No, that was funny.
[93:30.03]That was fun.
[93:32.13]What an awful joke.
[93:33.91]Holy shit.
[93:34.87]Okay.
[93:36.71]Now we're going to have some fun.
[93:40.23]Stream Sniperino.
[93:41.45]Okay.
[93:47.40]Uh... You.
[93:51.56]Yeah, that was your social eating stream that you guys have wanted.
[93:54.68]That's it.
[93:54.96]It's done.
[94:01.22]holy shit okay uh we're good uh who's what the fuck is that noise wow that's loud sometimes they're good too good joke haha that's what we do here we make really shitty awful terrible jokes that's the name of the game
[94:27.68]And by the way, I'm sorry if you thought that you didn't like those noises.
[94:34.16]Sorry about that.
[94:36.00]Let's go do some shenanigans for a little bit.
[94:37.76]And then I'm going to take off.
[94:39.56]I wanted to do an early stream today.
[94:41.62]Let's get invaded by like three people.
[94:46.37]There's already a person here that's not an invader, though.
[94:48.27]It's just an idiot.
[94:51.49]That's okay.
[94:55.07]Seriously, I was taking a bite of the hot dog.
[95:04.26]Why are we all standing out here?
[95:05.42]This is so bad.
[95:06.48]We need to get out of here.
[95:13.42]Oh my god, there's a lot of items.
[95:16.61]21 embers.
[95:18.35]65 fucking embers.
[95:20.01]100 embers.
[95:21.67]Alright, let's go this way.
[95:29.55]Let's get out of the open.
[95:37.10]I just found him, by the way.
[95:39.48]There he is, doesn't even know that we're here just yet.
[95:45.13]Oh, what's up dude?
[95:53.19]Seriously?
[95:53.81]Seriously?
[95:54.37]The stupid fucking petrify is gonna kill me.
[95:57.15]Give me a fucking break.
[96:02.35]He had me wedged in.
[96:04.47]I couldn't kill him.
[96:12.47]Wow.
[96:15.07]Wow.
[96:19.79]Oh, dear.
[96:33.54]I'm ready.
[96:36.79]I'll get soup in here again.
[96:46.40]Get this guy too, I guess.
[96:50.93]I need to put a little weapon on.
[96:52.35]Let's put on... I don't know, this?
[96:59.91]No.
[97:07.85]Overweight with that.
[97:09.45]Overweight with anything.
[97:12.71]Looks like it's only this.
[97:14.45]Okay.
[97:14.59]Okay.
[97:18.19]Did he beat Gale?
[97:18.91]I did.
[97:19.15]I did beat Gale.
[97:28.84]I used my thing, right?
[97:30.32]Yeah.
[97:34.08]We got a new purple one.
[97:35.20]This is like a mad phantom, right?
[97:38.72]The mad phantom is on the way in.
[97:45.08]Why did I summon that guy, by the way?
[97:48.89]Can't mad phantoms just fight and hurt you?
[97:56.41]Let's go.
[98:02.56]Okay, there he is.
[98:04.46]We got a full crew.
[98:09.56]We got a dark spirit already.
[98:13.10]See you later.
[98:16.58]I punched him in the back.
[98:17.40]That's a ton of damage.
[98:18.64]Nice.
[98:18.90]Actually does some pretty good damage.
[98:24.78]Alright, protect me.
[98:27.18]Don't let me die.
[98:28.08]We gotta get to the PvP spot.
[98:29.38]I swear to God.
[98:30.72]I swear to fucking God if this guy kills me.
[98:35.45]I swear to God if I died by the push guy.
[98:44.87]Don't even let him speak.
[98:46.07]Get him.
[98:48.63]He's just like locking me in.
[98:59.20]Just push him off.
[99:03.30]I'm covered in this spider shit by the way.
[99:05.06]Oh no.
[99:12.90]Thank God he doesn't throw you.
[99:14.00]There's a fight going on back here.
[99:20.12]Easy, easy, easy.
[99:23.68]Why did I aggro this guy?
[99:28.83]I'm going for a charge.
[99:41.12]This is such a bad place for us to be doing this.
[99:43.00]Why are we doing this here?
[99:46.88]Why is this stupid NPC still alive?
[99:51.50]He's killing us.
[99:53.74]This is the guy causing the problems, not the summoned guy.
[99:58.12]Oh my fucking god.
[100:00.32]The game just like crashed.
[100:11.21]What the fuck?
[100:36.11]We're getting out of this area, by the way.
[100:40.17]We're going somewhere else.
[100:47.57]I'll tell you where we're going.
[100:51.47]We're going... We're going to this place.
[101:02.64]This is so bad.
[101:03.56]I'm not trying to do anything in particular.
[101:07.24]I'm just trying to fuck around.
[101:09.92]Stop eating?
[101:10.50]Oh, you might have just got here before my apology.
[101:13.28]Or after my apology.
[101:14.10]Alright, I want to go out here.
[101:20.71]This is where the angel is, right?
[101:26.51]It is.
[101:28.94]The angel's still there?
[101:29.68]Oh, that's why I want to do this.
[101:35.40]He's right over here, right?
[101:37.84]No boss alive, so you can't summon?
[101:39.46]Oh, shit.
[101:40.28]Really?
[101:42.94]That's unfortunate.
[101:49.43]Aww.
[101:53.17]This guy beat Gale in three tries.
[101:55.07]He did.
[101:56.59]You're right.
[101:57.06]He did.
[102:03.34]I can summon this bad guy.
[102:06.06]Scott Steiner.
[102:06.88]Really?
[102:09.04]Why can I only summon Dark Spirits?
[102:12.30]Oh, there!
[102:18.74]Well, we're doing... I guess two people are coming in.
[102:23.39]Two Mad Spirits.
[102:27.71]Are they gonna come?
[102:29.73]Did I kill?
[102:30.11]I did not kill the dragon.
[102:33.79]I believe that's probably gonna be an off-stream thing.
[102:44.26]There's one.
[102:45.68]Alright, we have to fight over here.
[102:48.32]Where the angel is.
[102:51.34]So, both of you guys follow me.
[102:52.84]That is a fantastic pallbearer, by the way.
[102:57.02]That pallbearer is so good.
[102:58.64]I'm jealous of you.
[102:59.42]Alright, so follow me.
[103:02.94]We have to fight in the middle of the angel.
[103:04.34]They're right over here.
[103:08.38]Alright, let's go.
[103:10.62]Fight me.
[103:14.75]Wait.
[103:14.95]Did he not get hurt by that?
[103:20.87]Hold on, he can't get hurt by this?
[103:24.47]Yes he can.
[103:24.99]What?
[103:25.11]Why is he taking such a little damage?
[103:33.79]You wanna do that on me?
[103:39.86]Chuck it, I don't even care.
[103:45.31]Wow, wow, wow, you came out of nowhere.
[103:46.77]That's a fucking bad idea.
[103:53.51]This is fucking stupid.
[103:57.55]That was fucking stupid.
[104:07.99]Alright, new plan.
[104:12.55]We're gonna do action with like 3v3 PvP.
[104:17.18]Paul Bearer just destroyed me.
[104:23.46]I'm going to... Same password, but I'm going to just queue up for the PvP.
[104:30.37]Arena.
[104:31.63]Okay, so we got Grand Roof.
[104:35.47]Password matchmaking is going to be Vitamins.
[104:39.55]Password, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[104:40.39]Preferred team.
[104:41.87]Duel.
[104:42.33]Let's do a six-player brawl.
[104:46.06]Every man for himself.
[104:50.05]On the grand roof.
[104:51.28]Here we go.
[105:02.22]What system?
[105:02.64]This is on PC.
[105:07.97]Vitamins.
[105:15.29]Three more people.
[105:15.81]Come on, let's do it.
[105:17.18]Let's get it going, boys and girls.
[105:20.04]Alright, good.
[105:25.49]Every man for himself, everyone target me.
[105:30.73]Kinda can't do that in a six-person brawl.
[105:32.51]It doesn't really work that well.
[105:39.10]One has to... It's fine.
[105:42.06]Alright, match starting in 300 seconds.
[105:45.68]No, that's the time limit.
[105:56.26]I was going to say, what a mistake.
[105:58.09]Oh, there are six people in here, so I'm not going to get myself killed.
[106:07.29]How are you... What the fuck?
[106:14.98]Everybody just goes in.
[106:31.99]What a mess.
[106:35.33]Yeah, you can't just target somebody in this.
[106:37.45]It's too chaotic.
[106:38.31]It's not possible.
[106:39.40]That guy wasn't even paying attention and I couldn't even kill him.
[106:53.59]Oh god.
[107:16.21]I fucking love this shit dude.
[107:19.22]This is so stupid.
[107:26.68]Everybody just has a gigantic weapon just swinging it in random directions.
[107:37.27]I'm going up here.
[107:41.70]This is a little hiding spot.
[107:57.53]There's just no rhyme or reason to this.
[108:08.33]I'm just pressing L2 in random directions.
[108:10.65]I'm not gonna lie.
[108:19.39]Well, that was painful.
[108:20.29]Come on, drop down.
[108:25.46]Drop down, you know you want to.
[108:26.66]You want to drop down on me.
[108:35.46]Oh, fuck.
[108:39.33]It's so loud too.
[108:41.81]Holy shit, summon that guy to fight the boss.
[108:56.57]Oh, one more hit, come on!
[108:57.95]Oh, what?!
[109:00.11]Come on, dude, stop stunlocking me!
[109:02.11]Gotta go on the run!
[109:06.01]Oh, god!
[109:15.08]I'm trying to chase a guy and I got five people behind me chasing me.
[109:30.76]Wait, why did that not fucking lock him up?
[109:33.22]What was that?
[109:52.01]How much longer is this gonna go on for?
[109:56.85]One pixel.
[109:58.17]Yeah, pretty much.
[110:06.85]Like, I don't even know what you're doing dude, you're like freaking me out.
[110:29.32]We're not doing death counters right now.
[110:41.78]Not right now.
[110:45.50]Parry?
[110:46.20]No, there's no fun in that.
[110:47.24]Did I get one actual kill?
[110:50.14]I don't even know.
[110:55.61]I have no idea.
[110:59.38]Alright, let's do it again.
[111:01.52]This time we're going to do a... Let's do a one-on-one in the dragon ruins.
[111:08.63]One-on-one dragon ruins.
[111:15.75]Two bad Uggsman one?
[111:17.69]What do you mean Uggsman?
[111:21.59]Alright, one-on-one.
[111:22.63]I've got to lock myself in.
[111:24.35]I've got to get the kill here.
[111:26.51]1v1.
[111:29.23]GG's, bro.
[111:29.81]Thanks for playing.
[111:32.57]Yeah, we're gonna do like a handful of 1v1s.
[111:36.90]Is this the Dark Souls 3 Rumble?
[111:38.28]Ultra Greatsword.
[111:38.86]Okay, that's what it is.
[111:39.42]Alright.
[111:43.06]This is the first time I've ever been here.
[111:44.34]Does he have the same weapon?
[111:50.75]Oh, it's this guy again.
[111:51.75]Alright.
[111:55.79]Why did I get not locked on?
[112:00.82]Alright.
[112:03.62]We have the same weapon.
[112:08.06]We're doing the same exact thing right now.
[112:17.22]Oof.
[112:17.89]I need stamina.
[112:21.41]Oh, shit.
[112:22.25]Wow, I almost just fell off the edge, but I got it.
[112:25.45]Alright, that's a victory.
[112:26.89]Password is vitamins, by the way.
[112:32.04]Alright, we'll do it again.
[112:32.62]That was a 1v1.
[112:35.82]Same weapon.
[112:38.86]No, no.
[112:39.28]Chicken costume stays on.
[112:41.12]You gotta be there.
[112:41.62]Well, actually, I don't have the full chicken on.
[112:44.27]It's alright.
[112:44.85]Let's do it again.
[112:47.07]I actually like this place.
[112:52.81]We'll do this two more times and I'm gonna do one final 2v2.
[112:57.39]And I want to be a clean fight.
[113:00.75]No fucking around.
[113:08.67]Yeah, a little earlier.
[113:12.66]I was in the middle of a fight.
[113:13.68]Alright, this guy's different.
[113:16.50]He's got a big hammer.
[113:18.64]We're going to give him a false sense of security here.
[113:20.42]I'm going to stand still for one second.
[113:22.24]One, two, three.
[113:23.13]Ah, what?
[113:28.75]What?
[113:37.04]He's trying to throw shit at me, huh?
[113:38.28]Nope, not this time.
[113:40.80]GG.
[113:41.16]GG.
[113:41.86]Let's do one more.
[113:45.34]I gotta utilize this more often, I think.
[113:52.19]Jerma Yoda.
[113:55.17]Jerma Yoda.
[114:01.83]Hi, Otto.
[114:03.82]He might have to go out.
[114:05.06]You wanna go outside?
[114:06.94]Is that what you want to do?
[114:07.52]Uh, what just happened?
[114:14.58]Uh, Burpo wins.
[114:15.50]He does.
[114:16.66]Flawless.
[114:17.36]That wasn't a flawless.
[114:20.24]Yes, I'm currently using the new boss soul weapon, Gale Sword.
[114:24.19]Um...
[114:26.62]Without giving you any, like, real spoilers as to how to get it or where to get it.
[114:29.44]Yeah, I kind of just said it, but, you know, whatever.
[114:31.80]This is DLC.
[114:32.78]If you didn't expect to see a DLC spoiler, potentially.
[114:36.45]It is a boss soul weapon.
[114:37.49]Alright, what is that thing?
[114:51.20]Mm-hmm.
[114:56.19]Ooh, trying to go, like, firebombing on me.
[114:57.97]Shit, that's not good.
[114:59.17]Ooh, that's a lot of stagger.
[115:08.16]That's, like, a pretty good distraction, though, I will say.
[115:09.88]Ah, shit!
[115:13.08]Nice job.
[115:14.44]I thought I could go for a little... A little jokey thing there, but... Nice job.
[115:18.72]You caught me.
[115:21.85]Alright, we're gonna do one more.
[115:22.69]We're gonna do 2v2.
[115:25.21]And then I'm going to take off.
[115:27.25]I need to take auto out.
[115:31.09]I actually was surprised that I finished the DLC as quickly as I did.
[115:37.84]I thought there was going to be a... What is it?
[115:41.80]Two versus two.
[115:42.42]There we go.
[115:45.00]Two versus two on the dragon runes.
[115:47.11]I thought there was going to be a small area before the final boss.
[115:51.11]So, you know.
[115:53.89]It's okay though.
[115:55.63]I had fun.
[115:58.87]2v2.
[116:01.83]And then we're gonna call it for today.
[116:07.42]One more boss, the DLC's not done.
[116:10.46]That's true, but I really think I need to, like, just straight up do that on my own time, I think.
[116:21.39]I'd rather, like, just get really prepared and stream, not stream that.
[116:25.71]I did the same thing with the Nameless King.
[116:26.98]I beat the Nameless King off stream.
[116:29.90]But, okay, here we go.
[116:30.80]2v2.
[116:30.96]We're not putting ourselves in a great position here.
[116:40.95]Nice job.
[116:43.52]Nice work.
[116:43.98]Hooray!
[116:51.02]Combo?
[116:51.34]What's that guy's name?
[116:51.91]Combatant?
[116:52.39]Oh.
[116:52.45]I thought they had different names.
[116:58.85]Yum, Spikey.
[117:08.31]Oh no.
[117:10.94]He's going to... Shit.
[117:15.20]Yep, that one time.
[117:16.14]Shit!
[117:24.37]I need to go back and play through all of Dark Souls 3.
[117:28.99]I've done that like three or four times now.
[117:31.04]I'm not sure I'd want to do it again.
[117:32.56]What was that, dawg?
[117:38.22]Oh, you know what?
[117:40.60]Is it food as well?
[117:41.18]I'm trying to help this guy out.
[117:45.11]That might be what's going on.
[117:47.99]Are you stabbing, dog?
[117:54.31]No!
[117:54.91]Please!
[117:57.27]Let me get two healer.
[117:58.15]Two kills.
[117:58.65]Trying to eat your hair.
[118:10.27]Where are we?
[118:12.15]Why did I just spawn right here?
[118:13.85]Why'd I spawn right there?
[118:15.78]That was fucking so unfair.
[118:17.24]What the fuck was that?
[118:19.90]I spawned inside of that guy.
[118:23.36]That was total dog shit.
[118:25.81]Alright, I gotta focus here.
[118:27.09]It's time to get some kills.
[118:27.89]Let's get some kills here.
[118:33.83]As you hear Kim baby talk to the dog.
[118:42.27]Get out of here, you damn dog!
[118:47.45]Get out of here, you rotten, mangy little animal!
[118:54.73]Oh, shit.
[119:01.10]Ow.
[119:05.28]No, I did not beat the Dragon Ball.
[119:15.71]Who's even winning right now?
[119:16.71]Does anybody know?
[119:17.37]Wow, you can't stagger that.
[119:29.35]That sucks.
[119:33.27]Shit!
[119:40.97]Why did I start hating TF2?
[119:42.49]What are you talking about?
[119:44.09]I played TF2 like a week or two ago.
[119:45.45]I don't hate that game.
[119:47.65]What are you talking about?
[119:49.15]What are you on about?
[119:49.83]Shit.
[120:16.21]When did you start hitting Overwatch?
[120:23.54]This lasted a very long time, now that I think here.
[120:26.78]Shit.
[120:35.89]There it is!
[120:41.25]That's what I wanted!
[120:42.87]That's the move I wanted to do!
[120:51.21]Run, run, run, run, run, run!
[120:52.05]Hello!
[120:52.79]Well, I didn't get you.
[120:55.84]Shift.
[120:56.62]I thought I could be a distraction.
[121:05.89]Oh god.
[121:13.00]I love how it's like, why do I hate?
[121:14.58]Why do I hate?
[121:15.92]Why do I hate Family Feud?
[121:17.79]I can't wait to play Family Feud again.
[121:19.69]I want to play another Family Feud on stream.
[121:21.25]That was so much fun.
[121:22.79]The draw.
[121:26.17]The draw?
[121:29.43]Alright.
[121:30.17]Okay, I'll take a draw.
[121:33.99]That's it.
[121:34.31]Cool.
[121:34.81]Alright.
[121:38.69]Alright.
[121:40.41]Thank you for playing that.
[121:41.61]That was fun.
[121:43.25]This is where we kill the old woman.
[121:57.74]Game over.
[122:03.82]Alright, so.
[122:06.16]Thank you so much, everybody, for watching.
[122:09.69]That is the end of the Dark Souls 3 DLC.
[122:15.17]And by end, I mean that's what I'm going to stream.
[122:19.28]I'm actually happy that I didn't have to... To, like, complete the DLC.
[122:23.32]That I didn't do any summoning.
[122:24.28]So, I'm glad that that happened.
[122:31.69]But yeah, that was about... What's about I streamed for, like, four hours yesterday?
[122:35.11]Okay.
[122:37.83]So, like, three hours, three hours, four hours, something like that.
[122:41.69]Two hours.
[122:43.93]So, in total, the DLC was, for me, somewhere around, like, seven hours?
[122:50.21]Eight hours?
[122:53.27]Cool.
[122:55.87]Very cool.
[122:57.84]I like it.
[123:02.70]I won the six-man brawl.
[123:03.76]My life is complete.
[123:04.74]Let me just make sure I didn't miss any bits or anything.
[123:08.78]Yeah, the dragon wins.
[123:10.36]Yeah, I can't... I can't compete with that.
[123:15.99]Not right now.
[123:20.03]Anyways... I will see you guys... Maybe...
[123:26.44]Maybe on Saturday.
[123:28.66]I might actually see you guys on, like, Saturday night.
[123:30.86]Depending.
[123:32.50]I might do a stream Saturday night.
[123:33.90]Just to... For fun.
[123:35.86]Might go back to Hollow Knight.
[123:37.78]Might.
[123:38.58]I just feel like an off-schedule thing.
[123:39.80]It might happen.
[123:40.40]I'm not gonna give you any guarantees, but... We'll see.
[123:45.45]Like, sometime Saturday night, maybe.
[123:50.57]You might see me.
[123:52.93]But...
[123:54.92]If not, then I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[123:58.12]We're probably going to start something new on Tuesday.
[124:01.58]Might do something different on Tuesday.
[124:05.17]Take care, guys.
[124:06.49]Much love.
[124:08.15]And a special, special thank you to Chronic Waffle for $5.
[124:12.53]I've waited a long time to crush you with my pallbearer thanks for all the laughs.
[124:15.30]Well, thanks, dude.
[124:15.88]Thanks for playing.
[124:17.02]It was fun.
[124:18.97]It's always fun.
[124:21.49]Husan, thank you for the $5.
[124:23.35]Thanks for the early stream, pal.
[124:24.59]Also, happy advanced birthday to Kim from someone who was also named Kim.
[124:29.37]Very cool.
[124:29.81]Thank you.
[124:30.57]I'm sure she appreciates that.
[124:33.76]And yeah, Backbiter gave $100.
[124:35.48]That was a while ago, but I want to again say thank you for that.
[124:39.60]Never necessary, but always appreciated, right?
[124:43.14]It blows my mind every time.
[124:47.75]But have a good night, guys.
[124:48.73]Have a good rest of your afternoon.
[124:49.87]I'll see you guys on Tuesday, definitely, and maybe, maybe Saturday.
[124:53.58]So take care, guys.
[124:54.90]See you soon.
