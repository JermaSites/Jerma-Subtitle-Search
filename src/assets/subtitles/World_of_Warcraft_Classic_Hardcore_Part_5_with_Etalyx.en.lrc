[ve:61.1.100]

[00:01.36]Because for now I think I want to play some WoW.
[00:03.81]I'm very WoW starved.
[00:09.23]We were going to watch the opening cutscene and that was pretty much it.
[00:19.26]I'll get it figured out for next time.
[00:22.82]Yeah, I'm going to play some World of Warcraft.
[00:26.32]I'm going to be just chilling.
[00:30.38]I want to try to get to at least 19 or 20 tonight.
[00:40.87]Did Dracula even make an appearance in this game?
[00:44.43]Yeah, he was the main character.
[00:46.33]Yeah, I love that old stuff.
[00:52.05]Who knows?
[00:53.07]After playing WoW for a couple hours, I might just pick up another random game.
[00:57.47]Or, I don't know, tomorrow.
[00:59.43]I'm super into streaming right now, guys.
[01:00.83]I'm just having a ton of fun with it, so... Don't be surprised.
[01:06.13]Just launching WoW.
[01:14.22]Alright, what the hell was the last thing I even did?
[01:29.55]It's just fun to bring out anything.
[01:34.63]That excitement, the bug of I don't even know what this is and neither do you maybe.
[01:41.70]I love that.
[01:45.00]I'm on Windows 10.
[01:47.84]Is Windows 10 actually getting completely removed in like six months or is that not true?
[02:10.44]They'll still do security updates.
[02:14.61]Oh, no.
[02:15.07]No more.
[02:15.69]October 14, 2025.
[02:17.09]No more security updates, technical support, or software updates.
[02:23.27]Oh, man.
[02:23.91]I got to use Windows 11.
[02:51.18]Alright, here we are.
[02:54.52]Alright, let's go.
[02:55.36]What was I doing?
[02:56.16]I was... I was all kinds of messed up.
[03:05.23]Oh, that's not correct.
[03:15.17]You play Dracula for a couple hours and your resolution is just screwed up.
[03:25.05]Yeah, those of you that are not WoW friends and you're not into this.
[03:32.24]Hey, we'll see you.
[03:32.86]We'll see you for like Dracula 2 tomorrow.
[03:36.94]I'm down for anything.
[03:37.82]I'm just raring to go.
[03:38.76]OK, let me turn my volume up.
[03:47.98]You have a second Warcraft that's open, really?
[03:54.69]I do.
[03:55.33]Oh my god.
[03:55.91]Thank you for saying that.
[03:56.97]That would be bad.
[04:06.30]Is it Omega Gaming weekend?
[04:07.62]I did promise I would do one of these eventually.
[04:09.26]It's like Omega Gaming permanent.
[04:17.94]I'm kidding.
[04:18.38]That's not...
[04:36.98]Okay, so... What's the matter, Toe?
[04:46.50]Need to go outside?
[04:50.53]No?
[04:50.73]You just chillin'?
[04:55.93]Actually, he hasn't been outside in a while.
[05:02.91]When was the last time you were out, huh?
[05:05.82]Good dog.
[05:07.78]I'm going to fly to... Whaling Caverns is... Yeah, that's 25 or so.
[05:13.07]22.
[05:13.31]Could kill Quillbores.
[05:20.29]I know Etalyx was thinking about playing tonight too at some point.
[05:23.33]Maybe we'll grab him too soon.
[05:33.10]I'm going to go kill Turtles.
[05:40.75]Send him a message.
[05:41.43]Okay.
[05:57.03]Wait, run?
[06:03.43]Plastic straw?
[06:04.44]What?
[06:09.43]Why is it in plastic straws?
[06:10.71]Alright, I'm gonna go kill some turtles.
[06:22.47]And then I'm gonna let Otto out.
[06:24.01]Do you need to go out now?
[06:30.56]Okay.
[06:31.88]I'm gonna take a quick break.
[06:33.22]I'm not gonna play ads on this break.
[06:39.68]Because there's no reason to.
[06:40.88]There's no pre-rolls or anything that need to be turned off.
[06:43.13]I like to do them once an hour.
[06:45.73]I don't like doing more than that.
[06:47.55]So I'll be right back.
[06:50.40]We'll do our proper ad break in like 30-40 minutes.
[06:54.52]But give me a minute.
[06:56.07]Alright, let's go.
[07:14.61]I accidentally just pressed that, but okay, we'll just put it back on.
[07:52.40]you
[09:41.95]Thank you.
[12:03.69]Thank you.
[13:11.64]so so
[14:03.99]Okay.
[14:04.23]Yeah, he had to poop.
[14:19.81]Sometimes when he poops, he's like, I'm going to do it when I want to.
[14:25.17]That's fine.
[14:26.81]Alright, let's play some World of Warcraft.
[14:28.04]World of Warcraft.
[14:36.84]I'm going to turn it up a little bit.
[14:53.27]Alright, Etalyx is going to be hopping on too.
[14:57.06]In the meantime, I'm going to go kill turtles.
[15:00.78]Not just for experience, but also for money.
[15:03.76]I think their shells are worth a lot of money.
[15:08.42]He's TV gaming right now.
[15:11.84]Yeah, kind of.
[15:14.62]A little.
[15:27.38]My bags are fine.
[15:31.73]Crank this a little.
[15:32.49]There we go.
[15:32.79]Alright, let me remember the buttons.
[15:40.09]Stream title is a +2 right now.
[15:42.37]What does it say?
[15:44.47]Does this say Dracula?
[15:45.39]Alright, I'm going to get to at least 19.
[16:02.63]One level per stream.
[16:05.05]At this rate, I'll get to 60 in three to five months.
[16:19.23]Chaos Chris is kind of like Dracula.
[16:20.83]Yeah, he kind of is.
[16:26.87]This is not dangerous over here, is it?
[16:31.10]That's the most -2... Hold on.
[16:32.92]What is the title?
[16:33.58]I need to see.
[16:35.68]What does it say?
[16:38.92]Wow, wow.
[16:43.39]That's perfect.
[16:44.09]I'm leaving it.
[16:54.43]Hey, you should be definitely killing level 12 plane striders.
[16:58.95]I just was- I just was testing my buttons.
[17:00.64]I need to see if I remember how to play.
[17:01.90]Alright, careful.
[17:24.72]You think I'm a silly streamer?
[17:25.86]Yeah, well.
[17:33.48]These things are... No, level 16, 15, I'm fine.
[17:44.39]When do I get... When do I get soul fire?
[17:48.68]Does anybody know?
[18:04.83]You're too serious?
[18:05.83]How could I still not hear the volume?
[18:07.61]Like... I have it up times a million.
[18:10.28]Dude, I am actually excited for Dracula 2.
[18:42.14]You hate World of Warcraft now?
[18:44.81]I'm playing.
[18:45.91]What do you think this is a rip off game?
[19:04.88]This looks like a GTA mod.
[19:06.38]Do you think there's a GTA mod that has... I know the answer to this question is yes.
[19:11.43]That has World of Warcraft-like systems in place.
[19:25.89]I would play Castlevania.
[19:26.81]Castlevania is awesome.
[19:28.41]Which one though?
[19:29.17]Castlevania is a weird series.
[19:31.41]Because you either play one of the worst games ever made or one of the best games ever made.
[19:39.89]Aren't a couple of the Castlevania games stinkers?
[19:42.39]Like genuine stinkers.
[19:59.81]Symphony of the Night.
[20:05.29]Would I be good at those games?
[20:06.71]I feel like a lot of the Castlevania games are very difficult.
[20:15.03]Although it's only four buttons too, right?
[20:16.49]It's an attack, a jump, and a magic button.
[20:20.95]Maybe I would do pretty well in it, maybe.
[20:35.93]The Metroidvania ones aren't that hard.
[20:45.30]Dude, Vampire Survivors keeps getting updates, and they're just random, crazy updates.
[20:53.40]I forgot that game had more than three expansions now.
[21:05.45]In my mind, it was just the first expansion.
[21:10.01]They have an Among Us expansion with Among Us characters in it.
[21:12.97]I need some shards.
[21:39.78]played for a chill stream that's a good idea the beauty about doing this where I just kind of turn it on and I don't even how many viewers are there uh what am I doing uh is this gonna be funny uh I I'm just gonna do whatever maybe it'll be really funny sometimes maybe it won't maybe it'll be just like this but I'm I'm I'm down for anything at this point
[22:18.41]Yeah, Voice of the Void's another one.
[22:23.09]I got a gigantic list.
[22:30.40]And funnily enough, that list keeps being cut in line by Dracula. ...
[22:54.43]Yeah, I'm in the mood of finishing games.
[22:56.75]Oh, what's up, Etalyx?
[23:01.45]Get him in the call.
[23:18.55]Yo, what's going on?
[23:21.21]Just just hopped on.
[23:24.80]Hey, I just did too, and I just barely started doing the turtles down in the oasis.
[23:32.04]The turtles.
[23:35.06]Oh, the snap turtle shells?
[23:37.53]Yeah, we got to get shells, and then we got to... We got a few things to do here in the Barrens.
[23:45.87]How you doing?
[23:47.99]I'm doing good.
[23:48.39]I just beat Dracula, dead and loving it.
[23:52.86]was uh Dracula dead no actually he was very much alive oh he's alive but it's called dead and loving it yeah it's um if you just do a quick Google search you'll see alright did you just did you just tell me to Google it what are you
[24:12.00]Yeah, because the thumbnail for that game, which that is the game, that is actually the game name, the real one that I just told you.
[24:20.00]It'd be funny, though, if I was like, hey, so how's Monster Hunter Wilds?
[24:22.96]You're like, I don't know, Google it.
[24:24.24]Like, just look up the Metacritic.
[24:26.45]Well, the joke here is that that's a Leslie Nielsen movie.
[24:30.55]And if you type that in, it's Leslie Nielsen in a Dracula costume.
[24:42.69]It has a Rotten Tomatoes of 11%.
[24:44.31]I mean, it's not great.
[24:49.71]Mel Brooks as Abraham Van Helsing.
[24:52.77]Yeah.
[25:00.20]Wait, that is a Mel Brooks movie, isn't it?
[25:12.56]I've seen that movie once and it was free on YouTube.
[25:16.78]And that's where I saw it.
[25:18.52]I think I saw a decade more like two decades ago, but the fact that it was on, I just looked it up.
[25:27.93]There's a lot of free, weird, shitty movies on YouTube.
[25:31.45]It's actually kind of nice.
[25:37.16]Does anybody actually like care about Rotten Tomatoes anymore?
[25:45.19]Um, I feel like people just go watch movies if they want to watch them.
[25:49.21]Because some shit on Rotten Tomatoes is like a three, but it's one of the, you know, big movies and people like it.
[26:06.56]I just finished the quest, so I will hang out behind you and make sure nothing kills you.
[26:15.45]Hold on.
[26:16.05]Do you use the unit scan?
[26:19.39]Unit scan?
[26:20.47]It's the one that like warns you when there's like an elite nearby.
[26:24.18]Oh, I don't know.
[26:25.98]I'm just I'm playing with fire here.
[26:30.98]Like a giant red rectangle appeared on the screen when I got close to the turtle.
[26:35.55]Really?
[26:36.47]Really?
[26:44.49]Free YouTube movies are basically the only ones I watch.
[26:47.33]These are really good ones.
[26:48.25]They have a massive catalog.
[26:49.79]It's all weird stuff.
[26:50.98]Some of it's popular, too.
[26:55.72]You gotta watch some ads, but I don't feel like they were that egregious on the YouTube free movies.
[27:04.76]Although I do fall asleep to half of them, so they might just be playing ads in my sleep.
[27:07.94]I don't know.
[27:16.13]Put it on off, free for all, so you can get them all.
[27:34.48]So what were you doing today?
[27:35.62]Anything interesting?
[27:39.18]Well, I'll keep it short.
[27:43.16]I tried to play Project Zomboid.
[27:45.01]on an old campaign that I had and um I I had kind of like halfway quit it before because I thought that I was stuck and I kind of confirmed that I was stuck today so I have now uh admitted defeat oh no is it like so that that's the short version of what I did
[28:11.71]Can I recommend Dracula Resurrection to you?
[28:18.01]Is that, is that like a, I imagine that's like an FMV game.
[28:21.25]Uh, it, I actually, okay, guys, would you recommend that game or is it only to like enjoy?
[28:30.23]And I mean, recommending a game like that is hard because it's a certain level of crust and kind of, it's a very particular game.
[28:44.19]I would only recommend that to very certain people.
[28:56.16]I think it's, yeah, the art alone, it's like a giant art project.
[29:00.22]How many puzzles are in that game?
[29:03.08]Barely any.
[29:03.86]It's just a question of picking up random items that you might not be able to see and they're annoyingly placed.
[29:10.21]There's, I think, two puzzles in the whole four or five hour long game.
[29:15.62]Is it like a point-and-click adventure game?
[29:17.70]It is a Myst-like kind of first-person adventure game, yeah.
[29:23.76]It has all these weird, goofy cutscenes, and... I would say it's an experience, but... Yeah, we're going to have another experience.
[29:37.25]There's apparently three of them.
[29:42.36]Yeah, it's like find the object.
[29:44.60]You gotta find this that uses that.
[29:46.30]You gotta plug up the sink with the gum and then after the gum, you overflow the sink.
[29:53.17]That puts the key out of the drain and it's one of those.
[29:58.83]It's kind of confusing at times.
[30:12.99]It's very charming and it's very quirky.
[30:17.77]Is it confusing by average people's standards or just streamer standards?
[30:22.73]I think it's just confusing in general.
[30:24.20]The whole game is just a gigantic ball of confusion.
[30:34.26]It's to Jeremy's standards.
[30:35.58]What do you mean Jeremy's standards?
[30:42.84]Yeah, I spent two and a half hours trying to make a fishing net in Project Zomboid, and after I successfully made a fishing net, it broke after three uses, and the only thing I caught was a guppy.
[30:56.38]Oh, no.
[30:58.19]And then I was going to starve to death.
[31:04.91]Yeah, TLGR, it is a 10 out of 10 game, and I highly recommend it.
[31:18.21]Also all the Nancy Drews as well.
[31:23.78]How many Nancy Drews are there?
[31:26.60]30?
[31:26.62]40?
[31:27.90]Jesus.
[31:36.05]Do you think that there's like a like a secret society of hardcore Nancy Drew gamers who have the complete collection?
[31:44.50]Well, Nancy Drew 27 is where it really peaked.
[31:48.06]Oh, definitely, yeah.
[31:51.63]That was a huge franchise.
[31:54.93]There was movies, were there a couple of TV shows?
[31:56.97]It was a big franchise.
[31:57.91]Didn't they try to revive it recently, a few years ago?
[32:03.45]I feel like they tried to bring it back and it didn't really go so well, I don't know.
[32:07.48]Why didn't they make like a boxcar children game series?
[32:14.08]Oh yeah, I forgot about those books.
[32:28.71]Yeah, Boxcar Children was like the number one source in my childhood of taking... I don't know if you guys had like AR tests to score points in the library to get like a pizza reward later in the year.
[32:45.61]That sounds amazing.
[32:46.40]I think we got them all.
[32:54.24]You want to go try to kill Hezrel?
[33:00.83]He's to the left of the road.
[33:03.11]The other oasis.
[33:07.53]Like over by Wailing Caverns?
[33:11.56]That is actually exactly where it is.
[33:17.49]I used to just like hang out in the library.
[33:20.72]You know what?
[33:22.44]The pipeline from taking AR tests and trying to find the easiest books that you could cram in like five minutes to get the maximum number of points, the pipeline from that to achievement hunting.
[33:37.09]That explains a lot.
[33:39.99]That's funny.
[33:40.97]I would just sit in the library and look for like the easiest books to score points off of.
[33:46.82]Just, just jotting down the achievements.
[33:53.30]Oh, so they, they, they got us started pretty, uh, pretty early then.
[33:56.13]I remember those book fairs.
[34:01.47]It was awesome.
[34:04.71]Oh yeah.
[34:05.17]Like they would, they would do, they had bookmarks and they had like calendars.
[34:09.72]Scholastic, right?
[34:10.56]The scholastic book fairs.
[34:13.44]With like the big metal shells that they unfurl.
[34:19.38]I would end up with so many different... It was like collecting Pokémon.
[34:25.73]I still have a Gandalf bookmark from like a Scholastic Book Fair from like third grade.
[34:31.95]That might be worth some money, honestly.
[34:33.45]That thing is probably worth something.
[34:55.17]I need.
[34:56.79]For us, I feel like I remember being a kid and what like the top reward for the people who got a certain threshold of like accelerated reader points was they would take you to like a pizza buffet, but they would take you in a limousine.
[35:12.79]So all the kids got to ride in a limo.
[35:15.05]And I thought that was the coolest shit.
[35:18.75]You got a limo?
[35:20.01]Yeah, they like took out a limo.
[35:25.11]we thought we were hot shit damn rolling up okay I think he's I think this guy might be with two or three patrols by the way this might be kind of scary if this is the guy I remember and then you realize that like what first of all there's an elite around here oh careful careful look to left
[35:54.85]They're coming this way.
[35:56.15]Oh, let's get out of here.
[35:58.56]I'm killing my Voidwalker.
[35:59.56]Yeah, kill the Voidwalker.
[36:01.32]Those dudes will wipe us.
[36:03.80]That's the pack of four mounted level 25 elites.
[36:13.73]The Outrunners are patrolling here.
[36:17.85]How far do they walk?
[36:18.61]I know they go on the road.
[36:19.79]I didn't know they came all the way around here.
[36:21.84]Yeah, I didn't know they went all the way up here.
[36:23.58]Actually, I think I may have seen them once here, but I forgot.
[36:26.08]But they go all the way to the south and just loop around.
[36:28.59]Yeah.
[36:34.55]Yeah, you get older and you realize, like, who cares about limousines?
[36:40.52]It's just a long car.
[36:43.14]Well, it's not just a long, it's a long, expensive car.
[36:45.44]Maybe we should cut across the middle.
[36:58.37]Apparently I got to turn you up a little bit too.
[37:00.67]I also need to take a VRB because an ad break is going to start here.
[37:07.78]Not for another minute or so, but I want to get in a safe place.
[37:10.78]The last break I did, I took Otto out.
[37:12.36]He had to poop.
[37:16.98]So pre-rolls will be on.
[37:21.09]In case you wanted to know.
[37:25.51]Don't say poop.
[37:26.47]Why not?
[37:30.90]How do you say that word without being a little bit gross?
[37:34.12]It's impossible.
[37:34.74]I mean, yeah, I mean, you just... You just go, you just gotta let it roll.
[37:39.64]I want to make a T, too.
[37:40.52]I didn't get a chance to make another T. Alright, how about right here?
[37:50.98]This surely is safe, right?
[37:52.72]If the, uh... If the mounted patrol comes back, we're gonna have a great clip.
[38:02.37]Alright, well, just hug the mountain over here then.
[38:08.09]I think this is fine over here.
[38:09.09]We should be fine.
[38:11.77]Alright.
[38:13.29]I'll be right back.
[38:13.77]I'm going to make a tea.
[38:14.25]I'm going to make a rooibos.
[38:16.39]There actually is an elite over here.
[38:19.00]Really?
[38:19.48]Where is it?
[38:21.12]Devour.
[38:22.14]What is devouring ectoplasm?
[38:27.62]Oh, that's got to be like inside.
[38:29.96]Wailing caverns.
[38:31.83]Like the entrance?
[38:33.13]Never mind.
[38:33.49]You're good.
[38:34.57]Yeah, we're good.
[38:36.09]Hi, Rebecca.
[38:36.41]I don't think there's anything that spawns here.
[38:38.93]Who's this dude?
[38:42.31]Beerbeat.
[38:47.91]Dude, I'm making a triple T this time.
[38:54.63]Is that code for huge poop?
[39:00.38]That would be hard to do in three to four minutes.
[39:02.83]Alright, I'll be right back.
[39:06.29]That's a whole different conversation for Chad.
[39:10.47]I'll be right back.
[39:57.99]Hi, Chad.
[40:03.32]Say it back.
[40:42.08]Okay, somebody in JermaChat just said, can you be our new streamer?
[40:47.10]Jerma is mean to us.
[40:48.68]I've got some really bad news for you.
[40:57.07]You don't fucking want me.
[40:58.41]Look.
[41:08.43]You guys over there on Jeremiah's channel, like I'm like the fun uncle, but if you were my kid, you know what I'm saying?
[41:15.03]It would be a different story.
[41:23.81]The nice thing about being the fun uncle is when I get like tired, when I get annoyed, I get to just go home.
[41:33.96]And I don't have to deal with you anymore.
[41:45.91]Whereas my chat is instantly omegaload the second that you said like, oh, we need like a nicer streamer.
[41:54.77]My chat is omegaload instantly.
[41:58.57]Don't talk about, hey, excuse me, don't talk about parenting my children, okay?
[42:04.40]Don't talk about parenting, just talk about parenting my kids in front of me?
[42:06.62]Is that what we're doing?
[42:10.14]I said, I said you're a better parent is what I said.
[42:18.95]Alright, I'm good.
[42:28.88]Welcome back.
[42:34.68]I've been here.
[42:35.50]You welcome back.
[42:37.72]Well, I was saying welcome back to me to the stream.
[42:42.63]Yeah, and I'm saying welcome back to you.
[42:50.84]Well, some of you heard what he was saying.
[43:06.79]Hey, if I start running mid-roll ads, does that mean we get to sync the ad breaks during World of Warcraft?
[43:17.08]Yeah, I mean, in one hour from now, if you wanted to run them.
[43:32.79]I've been thinking about it.
[43:39.78]It's a, like I said before, it's just a good way to make sure you get up and if you make money, you make extra money, that's good.
[43:47.48]But also people know they're coming and you don't have to worry about a pre-roll if you're jumping around from stream to streams or if you refresh or if you get up for any reason.
[43:56.49]You know exactly where they're going to be.
[43:58.99]I think it's a healthier relationship with them, so.
[44:03.69]And I've been feeling great.
[44:04.73]Like, being able to get up every hour and just kind of move around and... Because like we said, we talked about before, it's so easy streaming years ago just to lock in for six or seven hours straight.
[44:21.14]Sometimes I wouldn't take one break a whole stream.
[44:24.17]And that's fucked up.
[44:25.19]That's not good.
[44:27.25]Yeah, we're going to like... You're going to die young if you do that too much.
[44:34.49]I've always called it gamer death.
[44:37.83]If you, like, keep your... You know, like, people who've died on airplane flights that are too long and they don't stand up and then they get a blood clot in their legs?
[44:48.06]Yeah, you gotta be careful.
[44:49.38]And then you, like, stand up and then the second you stand up it, like, releases the clot and you die?
[44:53.50]That's some scary stuff.
[45:00.23]Like, you can't keep your knees bent too long.
[45:02.90]Yeah, thrombosis.
[45:04.78]Yeah, it's no joke.
[45:05.42]Like you really should be kind of moving around.
[45:07.88]If you work in an office or something too, just every hour or two, just make sure you're getting up and doing a couple of stretches.
[45:15.47]Just even just walking to go just pace around in a circle for a few minutes.
[45:20.21]I feel like there's been at least one person who that happened to like in a, in like a internet gaming cafe, like overseas or something.
[45:29.33]Probably.
[45:29.73]I think he spawns.
[45:31.98]He walks around with a patrol, I think.
[45:33.42]He's over there somewhere.
[45:34.14]Okay.
[45:59.28]Is the spawn rate long on this guy?
[46:00.52]It might be pretty long.
[46:11.27]DVTs can progress into a pulmonary embolism.
[46:13.69]It's freaky.
[46:17.01]Yeah, just take care of yourselves guys.
[46:19.23]Seriously.
[46:23.56]Finding this dude is pretty hard, right?
[46:24.88]Because he could be dead.
[46:29.50]I don't know.
[46:29.94]I think he's level 19.
[46:33.06]This could actually be pretty hairy.
[46:35.18]We have a Voidwalker though.
[46:40.44]I love how that's like better than having a like a warrior tank.
[46:44.94]Well, it means we get two warriors effectively.
[46:57.72]He walks around the oasis.
[47:03.47]We could layer, too.
[47:07.09]He spawns right in front of Wailing Caverns, apparently.
[47:09.69]Yeah, I remember.
[47:10.45]I think I may have found him once kind of in front of Wailing Caverns.
[47:13.97]Hmm.
[47:29.18]I'll keep my eye out down here.
[47:34.66]Yeah, I think this is a good, like, split up.
[47:36.58]And actually, this is him.
[47:39.18]Oh, you got him?
[47:40.18]Yeah, he's over here.
[47:41.40]Very cool.
[47:43.53]Yeah, he's got two flanks.
[47:45.15]Like, two level 15s and a level 19.
[47:51.75]So if I send the Voidwalker onto him and we kill the two adds, I think we'll be good to go.
[47:57.82]Oh, someone's attacking him.
[48:00.92]Oh, no.
[48:02.72]Drop group.
[48:03.34]Can we get an invite?
[48:03.86]I got him.
[48:06.71]Oh, boy.
[48:15.99]That was a good pickup.
[48:21.57]I'm glad you walked over there.
[48:22.51]We wouldn't have even seen him.
[48:34.33]Almost got sniped.
[48:36.83]Okay, so now... We could turn these in and go... Let's turn these in and then go to Camp Draw.
[48:48.43]Because we've got a few things to turn in, and then... Do you want to do the wacko one?
[48:54.57]I'm afraid of it, but we could do it if you wanted to.
[48:57.61]We could do... Do you have Echiaki?
[49:01.15]Yep.
[49:02.81]Let's turn these in and then do it, Chuck.
[49:06.73]Sounds good to me.
[49:11.11]And then I feel like the raptor nest is, what, below Ratchet, right?
[49:21.62]Stolen silver.
[49:22.98]Yeah, it's down there.
[49:40.39]ah is that the like oh it feels good to be back in classic wow like ah it's just a game where you can literally just put your arm out I'm just playing with my mouse I'm just literally holding both buttons down
[50:00.22]You hear that, John?
[50:00.80]It's a great, great game to play with just one hand.
[50:05.56]No, it really is.
[50:08.44]It's true.
[50:25.57]Get an MMO mouse?
[50:28.09]I don't really like how those feel.
[50:31.14]There's too many buttons and I end up pressing them accidentally all the time.
[50:38.54]Do you click all the abilities when you're just playing with just mouse?
[50:43.33]It depends, yeah.
[50:46.65]I feel like I'm permanently paranoid where if my fingers are not on WASD at all times, I'm courting death, you know?
[50:55.65]I think if it's an area where I know is dangerous, I would never do just one hand.
[51:08.64]This next one is down here.
[51:10.06]I think I'm going to start saying, like, courting death more often.
[51:15.69]Like, it sounds pretty badass, I think.
[51:18.75]Give me one second.
[51:19.19]I want to grab my drink.
[51:20.53]I didn't get it.
[51:52.00]Yeah, I'm definitely going to have to go back and put that in chapter 7 of my novel in progress.
[52:05.05]I've been working on a typewriter.
[52:13.15]Okay.
[52:17.51]Rybus.
[52:19.09]Don't spill it, Jesus.
[52:22.16]Alright, so if we go... I know the FPS just dropped because that was... Okay.
[52:35.02]Ow!
[52:38.52]Playing on a... Playing on a sofa is hard, man.
[52:45.01]Do you have like... Do you have feather pillows?
[52:49.23]Feather pillows?
[52:50.49]Yeah, you know, like pillows with feathers in them.
[52:54.53]You know, sometimes they like... Wait, what?
[52:58.63]There's a turret.
[52:59.01]We got a turret.
[53:00.43]Oh.
[53:01.57]That guy's head we just got.
[53:02.39]Oh, I thought we were going to go get Echiyaki.
[53:07.60]Oh, yeah.
[53:09.68]It's an equal amount of distance, I think.
[53:10.88]He's like right up here, right?
[53:13.48]I guess we could just go do that.
[53:14.26]Yeah, let's go do that and then we'll come back around.
[53:18.72]Aren't the bones, like, over here somewhere?
[53:20.95]I think it's a little bit further north.
[53:27.13]It's up in this little divot between those two mountains up there.
[53:33.30]Anyway, what I was going to ask was if you use feather pillows, because, like, I have one feather pillow, and sometimes, like, most of the time, it's extremely comfortable, very relaxing, easy to fall asleep on, but sometimes...
[53:47.26]You just get like stabbed by a feather that just pokes straight through the pillow.
[53:52.01]Oh, that's right.
[53:52.55]There's like a risk reward system built in.
[53:56.59]It's down, right?
[53:57.77]What's the term for it?
[54:01.53]Yeah, like I guess like a down pillow.
[54:05.16]Yeah, and sometimes you just pull them out.
[54:06.80]They just... I haven't had a pillow like that in a very long time.
[54:17.88]like sometimes I wonder if it would like stab me in like the neck you know I'm sleeping or like poke me in the ear or something so you're gonna get a good cover for it and then it's up this way like I I thought um I thought that the covers for those were to protect the pillow from me but it was really to protect me from the pillow
[55:03.57]The pillow that I have now is pretty... Pillows suck now.
[55:08.38]Can we talk about this?
[55:10.58]They kind of do.
[55:11.78]I got one of those foam pillows.
[55:13.74]Yeah.
[55:15.82]they're more expensive okay we're not going to go down the econ like the economy uh conversation line but yeah they are more expensive and they're like worse at least 11 whatever yeah so every every year a list comes out of the top pillows of 2024. oh okay cool the top pillows and it's a generated article now but it's a different list every time and so get this one get this one I feel like every year or two there's a new best pillow and I buy it and it sucks
[55:45.61]What the hell's going on here?
[55:53.47]Wait, do you buy a new pillow every year from that list?
[55:56.72]No, every time I'm in the market for a new pillow, which is between every two to three years.
[56:02.14]Maybe every two years, I'd say.
[56:03.60]I get the best rated one and the thing that everyone's talking about.
[56:09.91]Have you heard?
[56:10.85]I am getting like advertised to and I'm buying them, aren't I?
[56:17.38]The ads are working.
[56:19.52]They're like sponsored lists.
[56:23.40]But even on pillows that you find in the store that aren't advertisements and it says, Ooh, look at this pillow.
[56:27.96]It's good.
[56:28.36]Okay, great.
[56:29.16]And you buy it and it's not good.
[56:31.11]And the list is always either CNET who's for some fucking reason talking about pillows or like Tom's Guide or like, like ratings, like the Artings, whatever, you know, ratings website.
[56:47.49]So can, what, what is the best pillow?
[56:51.23]I want a chat.
[56:52.98]I want you to tell me and Etalyx, what is the, what pillow do you use?
[56:57.68]And is it awesome?
[56:58.92]And be honest, don't sell me any advertisements.
[57:06.49]Well, this is what I'm asking is for a giant advertisement.
[57:08.81]So sell me, sell me.
[57:13.01]Memory foam?
[57:14.09]But yeah, but what... I feel like memory foam has lost its meaning over the last 10 years.
[57:20.21]Everything is memory foam now.
[57:21.27]They make memory foam slippers.
[57:27.35]You can call something memory foam and it's coffee filters stacked on top of each other.
[57:45.66]Memory foam chips.
[57:53.94]Costco actually has some good ones.
[57:56.74]Bamboo.
[57:59.40]Bamboo?
[58:01.00]Bamboo pillow.
[58:01.74]That's... Alright, that worked.
[58:04.04]What do you mean?
[58:06.70]Buckwheat or bamboo?
[58:08.36]I think they're just watching from like the jungle.
[58:11.24]Like they... their plane crashed or something.
[58:16.18]I'm seeing a lot of people rallying around this.
[58:20.32]Bamboo is actually great.
[58:21.44]A bamboo pillow.
[58:24.25]I'm gonna have to look into this.
[58:38.72]Like extremely hard bed over medium bed or like super soft bed.
[58:44.65]Like firm or soft?
[58:48.54]Yeah, do you like a runny bed?
[58:49.64]Do you like an over medium bed?
[58:51.22]Or do you like a hard boiled bed?
[58:53.60]Scrambled is definitely water mattress.
[58:56.00]Yeah.
[58:57.82]I like my bed like I like my eggs.
[58:59.38]I like it medium hard.
[59:00.34]What can I do for you?
[59:06.56]Strength.
[59:06.74]Go with us.
[59:13.58]If a bed's too soft, I feel like you sink into it.
[59:18.52]You get hot, sweaty on a soft bed.
[59:20.86]It just sucks all over you.
[59:22.45]No, I don't like it.
[59:22.99]Alright, we could go... Turn in this one and then go to Camp Taraho.
[59:32.29]Alright, are we going to do this and potentially die here?
[59:41.96]Oh, is this like the Kolkar boss?
[59:44.98]This is the Kolkar boss and you only get 25 silver for doing this.
[59:49.78]I do have Warchief's Blessing right now, so that helps a little bit.
[59:53.38]That is helpful.
[59:55.74]If it gets hairy, make sure you have a Swiftness Potion because it actually is very scary.
[60:01.78]Swiftness Potion is great, but the Kolkar can net, so that can be the death sentence.
[60:09.29]Oh shit, I thought I could get out of it.
[60:10.77]No, that's the gnome.
[60:17.55]Bone bed toppers or ball savers?
[60:25.28]I kind of get what you mean.
[60:26.08]Hey dude, what happened with the bag rule?
[60:39.37]I see three rune cloth bags equipped.
[60:43.91]I said I was going to do that every 10 levels, and I got to level 18 and put them all on.
[60:47.77]I got the runecloth hand-me-down.
[60:53.70]Yeah, so I did a good deed.
[60:55.18]I gave one to Etalyx, so that means I could put them on.
[60:58.42]That was my justification.
[61:02.47]Look at this mess.
[61:03.75]This guy's level 20 elite.
[61:07.87]And he runs at you with all these people.
[61:09.65]Yeah, one, two, three, at least three or four people.
[61:12.57]Oh yeah, somebody must have like fled.
[61:14.09]Yeah, you have to.
[61:15.59]He runs, he sprints at the person that is on the quest.
[61:22.16]This is going to be horrific.
[61:33.52]You get a good ring for doing this though.
[61:38.96]Alright, do we dare do this?
[61:45.77]Yo, we get a ring.
[61:46.77]First ring, yeah.
[61:51.87]Huge.
[61:54.60]Honestly, like if there was like one more person here, maybe like one to two more would be like very safe.
[62:00.62]Like this guy right here, this tauren hunter.
[62:08.95]Exactly like them.
[62:21.64]We're too scared.
[62:22.72]It just kept running.
[62:30.32]Get the quest and grab the banner on the ground.
[62:32.24]Oh shit, really?
[62:33.90]Oh my god.
[62:34.44]Okay, ready?
[62:35.22]Make sure you get ready to accept this.
[62:38.27]Ready?
[62:41.19]No, I already accepted the quest.
[62:42.61]I don't think it starts anything.
[62:44.79]Can you get the banner on the ground?
[62:47.79]The one that we walked past?
[62:48.83]The one we walked right past.
[62:49.73]Somebody said... Oh my god, we actually can do it, I think.
[62:52.82]Oh yeah, we can.
[62:53.32]Oh my god, this is free!
[62:56.48]Do not despawn.
[63:04.76]Nice.
[63:05.70]Oh, hell yeah.
[63:07.49]That's maximum cheese.
[63:09.01]That is cheese.
[63:09.89]Oh, I don't care about that.
[63:11.15]That's fine.
[63:11.67]This quest sucks.
[63:17.45]Stolen Valor.
[63:19.69]We got it.
[63:23.10]In Azeroth.
[63:24.20]Didn't this guy know as we did that?
[63:35.11]I'm going to tell my grandkids about how I helped kill Kromzar.
[63:37.82]Hey, nobody could prove we have a piece of the banner.
[63:43.78]Why would we have that?
[63:44.64]Okay, now we could go to Taraho.
[63:51.27]There's a bunch of stuff in Taraho now.
[63:54.39]And all these... The 60 quail boars, right?
[63:57.59]This one's kind of all in it.
[64:06.19]so did you re did you for sure want to skip the uh northeast stuff like the sam the sam aflange yeah it takes so long that the drop right on we'll be up there for an hour and we'll not level up we'll just kill things and because I think there's an escort there too we'll see how we feel after doing this
[64:44.79]I'm gonna, uh... I'm gonna grab my sandwich.
[64:48.10]I got a sandwich.
[64:49.40]You got a sandwich?
[64:50.40]What kind of sandwich?
[64:50.94]I got a sandwich.
[64:52.22]It is ready, it is in the fridge, and it is calling my name.
[64:55.56]I might be a stream eater.
[64:59.46]Just make sure you get the microphone real close.
[65:12.15]It is.
[65:14.43]a uh I I it's a cheesesteak whoa just a just a cheesesteak sitting in the fridge waiting I wonder if he's going to shove the cheesesteak up his ass um read that one
[65:34.02]Well, I like to read them because I like to embarrass them because they didn't expect me to read them.
[65:38.14]And then they freak out and they go, wait, wait a minute.
[65:40.28]Um, he wasn't supposed to read that one.
[65:42.08]That was for chat only.
[65:43.70]And I go, yeah, really?
[65:46.08]Well, I can see it too.
[65:54.14]We're going to Taraho?
[65:56.26]Uh, yeah.
[65:59.52]And I'm not going to BRBR and I'm just going to run over and...
[66:02.50]grab it I mean he said he was playing with one hand who's to say what the other hand's for eating a sandwich eating a sandwich real gaming time
[66:45.21]Alright, is this a cheesesteak that you ordered an extra so that you would have an extra for another meal, or is this a leftover one?
[66:52.81]This is the strategy, yep.
[66:54.17]It's, uh, you get two.
[66:55.99]Yeah, you get two.
[66:56.77]Okay.
[66:57.07]I just didn't know if it was like a, like an unfinished.
[67:06.70]A lot of places in Vegas have become enlightened to the, like, put cheesesteak in everything.
[67:12.81]I have had a cheesesteak burrito that was delicious.
[67:18.46]I have had a cheesesteak gyro that was also delicious.
[67:21.84]A cheesesteak burrito?
[67:27.11]Yeah.
[67:34.55]It kind of goes into anything where bread is like a major component of the meal.
[67:38.45]Anyway, welcome to part three of the Food Network podcast.
[67:44.15]Today we're talking about cheesesteak.
[67:47.09]My dog just like sneezed in it.
[67:56.38]He's he's not very tall, so like I'm trying to figure out that you like like oh here you go.
[68:01.34]You can't have this where you know I just I sat down and he's he's he was over here and he just looked.
[68:07.36]He was like what is that?
[68:08.34]And he sneezed.
[68:09.94]Did you guys hear it?
[68:11.52]That's alright, I'll be fine.
[68:16.69]he's allergic to cheesesteak dude it's pretty good cheesesteak cheesesteak fries are uh pretty great as well
[68:35.91]I just haven't had to eat stuff like this in so long.
[68:39.36]I decided, I was like, you know what?
[68:41.44]I said this the other day.
[68:42.76]I'm going to eat cheesesteak and I want a pizza.
[68:45.64]I want to get a pizza.
[68:46.50]Sounds amazing too.
[68:47.58]Talked about it.
[68:57.31]Is it five big booms?
[69:00.21]Let's find out.
[69:01.93]Hmm.
[69:06.81]Oh yeah.
[69:08.37]Boom.
[69:09.13]Boom.
[69:09.89]Boom.
[69:10.67]Boom.
[69:11.45]Boom.
[69:15.01]Oh yeah.
[69:28.54]That family just started dominating the entire internet.
[69:34.40]All of a sudden I see him on like Jimmy Fallon and... Oh yeah.
[69:39.97]They're like throwing the first pitch out at the... The Dodgers game.
[69:44.79]I don't even know if that's true, but it might be.
[69:57.40]Oh no, it was wrestling.
[69:58.28]Yeah, it was wrestling.
[70:06.01]Okay, we get these?
[70:06.63]The Rizzler is in a Welch's ad?
[70:29.76]You know, we needed like... I...
[70:33.58]I'm not this is not a derogatory comment but I think that one of the reasons that contributed to their blowing up was the world yearns for a controversy free e-celebrity and they're currently filling that like position like it it seems risk-free you know for them to be like in everything well I mean it seems it seems like a nice nice guy nice family I don't know I don't really know anything about him
[71:22.61]alright we're gonna kill cool boars uh this area is one of the patrol routes for the mounted elites yeah we just yeah just get off the road uh I mean the road is like safer because at least if we see him we can dodge whereas we're gonna accidentally aggro like level 22 thunderhawks on the left that's true
[71:56.80]wow it's such a great game because I have enough time to eat an entire cheesesteak by the time we do one quest it's great oh wait do we do we not want to do the bristlebacks because they're level 21 no we'll be fine oh they're up here we're going too far down oh yeah these guys first
[72:25.74]yeah let's take these one at a time see if we can even hit them resist resist resist I'm clicking all my shit oh shit I dropped my hold on give me one sec
[73:10.24]I just dropped some of it.
[73:15.65]The first anniversary of their first Costco Guys TikTok is actually today?
[73:22.20]Really?
[73:23.30]Is it?
[73:26.56]That's what somebody said.
[73:27.47]It's like timing.
[73:31.57]When did TikTok and YouTube do it?
[73:34.97]When was Shorts really the dominating platform?
[73:36.89]That was what, 2021?
[73:37.45]2022?
[73:37.55]I feel like it wasn't until after COVID.
[73:45.28]You mean like TikTok slash YouTube Shorts?
[73:48.74]Yeah, when they started to really be the premier place where tons of people started to do it.
[73:55.02]2020? 2020?
[73:58.48]uh yeah I think it was I think it was like around then because vine was nowhere near where tiktok is have you ever made a tiktok or a youtube short you personally ever no I I haven't yeah vertical versus horizontal yeah okay we should be kind of careful here though I would argue that most content creators
[74:28.13]who have shorts aren't making it themselves either.
[74:34.37]Watch that right side.
[74:35.17]I always thought it would be fun to do, but... I don't know.
[74:48.84]It's just such... You kind of... TikTok and reels and YouTube shorts...
[74:57.16]I feel like you have to, you gotta have a bunch of them.
[75:03.46]I mean, it's kind of, it's kind of how YouTube is where you make YouTube videos.
[75:08.38]You're not counting on each individual video.
[75:12.86]You have to have like the library, you know, like the old ones that build on the new ones.
[75:17.76]I don't even know what I would make.
[75:19.88]Like what would I, what the hell would I even say?
[75:21.36]What, what, what, what would I even do in it, in a YouTube short?
[75:24.65]Oh, you're making one right now.
[75:28.32]He just made one right now.
[75:29.37]I feel like one minute's not enough time for anything.
[75:39.41]But I'm such a delay... stalling... Everything takes forever for me to do.
[75:45.35]So I can never get my point across in 30 seconds.
[75:47.38]It takes eight minutes for me to talk about stuff.
[75:54.30]Unless you have like a 600 part YouTube short.
[75:59.58]yeah some people use it as a gateway to try to get you to like oh watch the rest of this it's like a trailer for a video they want you to watch don't people do can you get like a whole oh yeah I saw um I saw Lord of the Rings oh really cool what'd you think about it well I saw it in uh in youtube shorts so it was I thought it was pretty good
[76:29.06]you could probably do that we're gonna get spawned on it's gonna be ugly I'm gonna try and grab some of these uh ore spots it would have that music behind it too that shitty music
[77:03.37]That's literally me on YouTube watching part 9 of 15 of a movie.
[77:08.83]Well, they get you though, because they'll have a video uploaded that says, here's the movie.
[77:14.61]It's an hour and 35 minutes long.
[77:17.79]Oh, this must be the movie.
[77:18.78]It's not the movie.
[77:20.16]It's a fake video.
[77:21.44]And there's a link in the description.
[77:23.02]That's a fake.
[77:24.62]You got to go here instead.
[77:28.30]Those were everywhere back in the day.
[77:30.10]They might still be there now.
[77:35.74]oh yeah you think you're watching like a full movie on youtube and it's just like a they even made the video like an hour and 41 minutes but it's just like a jpeg that's what I mean it's like they have a full almost two hour upload to me that's like getting the scam call it's like if you if that happens and you go down to the description and you click the link you got kind of scam called
[78:04.64]It's like answering the scam call and being like, yep, it's the IRS.
[78:07.82]Oh, okay.
[78:10.50]What can I do for you?
[78:11.78]Those definitely still exist, but I feel like a lot of the new ones just moved to Facebook where they'd have like a higher success rate with your like grandparents clicking.
[78:28.64]Naruto episode 23, part one of three.
[78:35.99]Speaking of anime, any good animes?
[78:41.81]I haven't watched any recently.
[78:43.51]The closest anime adjacent thing I've watched was Arcane Season 2.
[78:49.39]Which I really liked.
[78:56.76]We can go up a little higher here.
[78:57.80]There's more.
[79:05.38]So Arcane, people keep talking about this Arcane this, Arcane that.
[79:10.62]And I might have to watch more than the first two episodes.
[79:16.00]Yeah, I mean, I feel like you start watching it and then you just get hung up on the theme song and then stop watching and then start just like going like, uh oh, the misery.
[79:28.20]And then that's all you need.
[79:29.24]That's all you like need from Arcane to feel fulfilled.
[79:34.80]I mean, it is quite a song.
[79:39.98]I promise I'm going to contribute much more than I am in about two minutes.
[79:55.17]Everybody wants to be.
[79:57.65]Every single person wants to be my enemy.
[80:07.80]I would say the theme song from Arcane season one went full circle for me.
[80:15.06]It went like the first time I watched it, I was like, huh, interesting.
[80:19.04]Imagine Dragons.
[80:20.18]Then like episodes two through seven, I'm like, I hate this and I hate Imagine Dragons and I've never liked them and I hope that the radio fails.
[80:28.64]And then it comes back around, like by episodes like eight and nine, you're singing along.
[80:34.04]And then episode 10, you're sad to see it go.
[80:39.74]I had the Imagine Dragons chat on my stream.
[80:44.00]Is their music that bad?
[80:45.51]I feel like people like their music.
[80:53.43]I've only heard two songs from them.
[80:55.89]Maybe three.
[80:59.12]I don't know.
[81:00.94]Has anybody ever said you gotta listen to this new Imagine Dragons album in their life?
[81:07.00]Like, has anyone ever said that?
[81:09.50]No, I've never been personally approached to listen to the Imagine Dragons new... I was gonna say theme song.
[81:26.66]I'm gonna need to get power washed my body after this.
[81:32.98]This is the most disgusting my mouse has ever been in the history of me owning this computer.
[81:45.16]I feel like, um, the Venn diagram.
[81:49.02]That means a fucking cheese stick.
[81:52.75]Like, imagine dragons calling them up to make you a theme song is in the same overlap as, like, calling up, like, Macklemore.
[82:05.29]I don't know music at all.
[82:06.31]I really don't.
[82:14.73]By the way, can you guys hear me eating?
[82:16.23]I'm trying to make it so I'm going away from the microphone.
[82:20.07]I hope not.
[82:23.84]I can't hear it.
[82:24.42]It's just sometimes it sounds like somebody punched you in the mouth.
[82:42.16]I would, I would say Imagine Dragons and Malcolm Moore and everybody that's like, if you, if you right click them on Spotify and go to related artists, anybody on that page is like grocery store music or like, like, like the cool bank.
[83:01.47]What's the current in music right now?
[83:03.47]What's that currently in right now?
[83:09.01]I, I guess at the, I mean, I would say, um,
[83:14.80]I would say what's in is it has to be Kendrick, right?
[83:17.61]Like it has to be.
[83:18.57]I don't know.
[83:20.13]I don't know what else anybody would say.
[83:22.97]Oh, they all spawn.
[83:23.89]Let's take this very slow up this way.
[83:25.88]Let's go through here.
[83:34.73]Sabrina Chapel.
[83:43.79]don't listen to any music man yeah I I used to listen to music but then my uh I relied on Spotify to like find new songs for me but then I started listening to video game music for streams and it heard me listen to like one or two songs it was like you like video game music good because that's all I'm ever gonna suggest again
[84:07.78]And so I have not heard a real artist on like a real... Not that video game music isn't real art.
[84:13.76]I just mean like a song with lyrics.
[84:16.07]You mean like a pop culture artist.
[84:18.35]Yeah.
[84:19.03]Somebody that's popular.
[84:20.95]It's only video game music now.
[84:24.73]I love video game music.
[84:25.57]You listen to like the Kingdom Hearts soundtrack once and it's like, I got your number.
[84:32.30]This is the JRPG playlist now, bitch.
[84:47.75]Alright, I'm about to become a game player again in a second here.
[84:53.73]After we kill this guy, give me one minute.
[84:55.19]I'm just going to go wash my hands and wipe my mouse.
[84:59.92]When you walk away.
[85:03.12]That went so hard.
[85:04.90]I remember hearing that for the first time and everybody was just captivated.
[85:08.74]You can't hear me say.
[85:09.90]Alright, we're back.
[85:30.88]I may have got the lyrics wrong, okay, but I was just winging it based on memory.
[85:42.51]I started Kingdom Hearts over again, like, five times when I was a kid, because I rented it from Blockbuster, and there was no child in the world who's ever beat Kingdom Hearts in a weekend.
[85:53.45]They knew what they were doing.
[85:54.47]They're gonna get you to come back and rent it, like, ten times.
[85:57.24]But I just started a new game so I could hear, like, I could watch the cutscene.
[86:03.83]It's like, mom, no, I'm not ready to take the blockbuster yet.
[86:12.88]That was from an era where watching, like if there was a, if there was like a video game cut scene, you were like, yes, PogChamp.
[86:19.68]Now, if there's a video game cut scene, you're like, ah, shit again.
[86:22.33]And the, and the only one who knows how to walk that line is Kojima.
[86:27.35]And I will die on that hill.
[86:37.36]Good point, honestly.
[86:38.44]That's a really... That's a really good point.
[86:40.76]That, like, cutscenes used to look forward to, but I feel like it depends on the game.
[86:44.43]Yeah, cutscenes used to be a reward.
[86:47.51]It was like, yeah, oh, finally, I hit a checkpoint, I get a cutscene.
[86:50.79]Whew.
[86:52.65]Like, I can take my hands off the controller for a minute.
[87:01.14]And now it's like, let me push buttons again.
[87:06.23]I don't care about your shitty AI-generated dialog.
[87:36.90]Alright, I'm ready to game.
[87:43.12]I'm ready to game.
[87:44.88]And I'm gonna watch this parse here that I do on this next grillbore.
[87:48.22]You guys are gonna shit your pants when you see this.
[88:00.43]Oh my god, this is so greasy.
[88:02.97]I don't think I'm even gonna get this up.
[88:06.59]Ugh.
[88:09.00]Do we care about Onyxia slash Rend?
[88:14.62]Um, maybe.
[88:16.30]Because if we want it, I think it... Guild chat says it's dropping in like 21 minutes.
[88:23.38]I think we should get it if we can get it.
[88:24.66]21 minutes?
[88:31.02]Alright, I'm ready.
[88:34.19]Let's go.
[88:35.93]Alexa, set an alarm for 21 minutes from now.
[88:43.07]I feel like nobody has that anymore.
[88:46.75]Statistically speaking, somebody's Alexa just responded.
[88:58.25]Yeah, somebody said that'll be too late then.
[88:59.43]It's gotta be eight, 17 minutes.
[89:07.38]This dude is sniping all the kills.
[89:30.22]I will help you as soon as he's roots I'll get 19 from turning this in Oh thank you for reminding me I gotta spend my talent point
[89:48.23]my alexa knows she's only one mistake away from the scrap heap alexa knows this I feel like the voice activated apps were such a good idea but everyone thought they would be so fun and now the most you will ever use it is like what's the weather today like see these two ais oh like talking to each other
[90:18.80]They switch it up.
[90:19.30]They go, let's speak in a different language.
[90:21.60]One that's easier for us to use to manipulate the humans.
[90:26.79]Oh my God.
[90:27.29]Oh my God.
[90:27.63]Oh my God.
[90:27.91]Oh my God.
[90:28.17]What just happened?
[90:29.55]Are you dying?
[90:30.39]I'm dying.
[90:31.69]I'm coming.
[90:34.05]Oh my God.
[90:34.61]I'm actually fucking dead.
[90:37.22]Oh my God, dude.
[90:38.10]I'm actually going to die.
[90:39.22]This is GG.
[90:40.44]This is fucking GG.
[90:41.20]What happened?
[90:44.86]No, no, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[90:45.70]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[90:46.82]I taunted, I taunted.
[90:48.14]Oh my god, this thing was just fucking smoking me.
[90:50.90]Oh my god, dude.
[90:54.61]Alright, I gotta eat.
[90:56.19]I charged, stunned, and taunted.
[90:59.69]I just sacrificed the Voidwalker the last second, and I thankfully, thankfully you were right there, too.
[91:05.72]What the fuck, dude?
[91:06.70]He was just... Bomb hit on me.
[91:09.60]Bomb crit.
[91:10.76]Bomb crit.
[91:11.40]That guy just... And the Voidwalker wouldn't take aggro.
[91:14.29]He just wanted to kill me so bad.
[91:15.75]That was a fucking chatter.
[91:20.67]Okay, uh... This is a chatter.
[91:27.12]Okay, you got any Hellstones?
[91:28.28]Oh my god.
[91:29.80]Dude, I need a... My, like, heart is racing.
[91:33.30]That was fucking horrible.
[91:36.55]I thought we were fine.
[91:37.45]Okay, let me get another shard.
[91:41.97]I actually think I might have been okay if you were there and taunted because I did sacrifice the Voidwalker and I had 300 HP.
[91:52.61]So I think I was alright, but that was horrible.
[91:54.99]Yeah, I saw your health go back to half and back to a quarter and then back to half and then back to a quarter.
[92:05.96]Oh wait, am I not supposed to kill him?
[92:07.56]No, you're good.
[92:10.06]Yeah, I would have lived.
[92:11.32]Just seeing your health bar go to 5% is not... And I need to get my health stone.
[92:17.67]Okay, yeah.
[92:18.79]I don't even know.
[92:19.35]We're just talking about two AIs.
[92:20.57]Oh my god, that was not... That was... Oh fuck, I have a headache now.
[92:29.37]Oh, that's why we play hardcore, baby.
[92:33.01]The adrenaline you just felt, the spike, that's hardcore.
[92:40.70]He just was relentless.
[92:42.14]It was one of these guys.
[92:43.28]That was absolutely relentless.
[92:47.66]Let me see my combat log.
[92:52.66]Yeah, I have 400 HP.
[92:56.11]Fireball, 94, 104, 79, 80.
[92:56.91]Yeah, four of those kill me.
[93:03.15]He was completely relentless.
[93:13.29]Like when I taunted, he was queuing up like an extra attack against you.
[93:17.31]Probably wouldn't have killed you, but he did have like another ranged something coming.
[93:22.31]God.
[93:35.33]It's funny, I almost drank one of these, thinking it was this.
[93:39.71]That would have been very funny if I died from that.
[93:41.69]Okay, hold on, be careful here.
[93:50.62]Oh, that motherfucker's running.
[93:52.34]This place scares the shit out of me now.
[93:54.80]Ever since I almost died.
[93:55.60]Yeah, uh, anybody remember when Jerma almost died over here?
[94:05.74]It was almost like it was yesterday.
[94:06.96]It was just like it was... Like it was just... Like it just happened.
[94:16.05]We're done with the thorn weavers.
[94:19.51]Yeah, we just need like the 60 tusks.
[94:21.99]I think we need... We need... We need those geomancers.
[94:30.10]Those horrible ones.
[94:30.82]And then we need water seekers.
[94:44.24]Yeah, I think that was the Lord telling me.
[94:47.88]Hey, uh, don't eat cheese steaks and play with one hand in hardcore.
[94:52.57]That's the one warning you're gonna get.
[94:56.19]Your hands were so greasy it didn't even hit the right keys.
[95:13.37]I don't want this guy to run.
[95:14.39]I really don't.
[95:15.17]He's gonna... Sorry.
[95:24.12]Speaking of this shit, why is this not on?
[95:26.50]Let me get my stuff situated here.
[95:33.63]Okay.
[95:34.67]Okay.
[95:57.85]Are there more over here on this side of the mountain?
[96:13.18]There's some over here.
[96:15.58]Yeah, there's water seekers over here.
[96:31.61]wrote clear bought what what my clear my well I just I ate a cheesesteak sorry it's been a long time since I've had one of those too what a cheesesteak yeah like a big cheesesteak I kind of like imagine you just ate a cheesesteak every week at least actually hold on this is scary they're gonna add break coming up but I'm I don't think I'm gonna take it not here
[97:15.38]Now that would be even funnier.
[97:20.92]What's that?
[97:22.43]It's like running an ad right now and then coming back and I'm dead on the ground.
[97:25.61]You're still recharging.
[97:37.87]God, these guys hit so hard.
[97:58.90]If you don't record your first death, you're going to get kicked out of the guild.
[98:04.94]It'll be recorded.
[98:10.62]I don't know why I started attacking this dude with like two-thirds of my HP.
[98:13.92]Living dangerously.
[98:16.17]Yeah, let's back up a little here.
[98:37.36]Resist what?
[98:50.98]Oh, who's going to get there first?
[98:51.88]I think we killed all the... I think we just need... Yeah, we just need Quill for... Oh no, we need Geomancer still.
[99:10.65]If Reviewbrah ate the same cheesesteak that you just ate with Otto having sneezed on it, what do you think his rating would be?
[99:17.70]Pretty high.
[99:18.34]That was like a... That was like probably a 7 or 8 out of 10.
[99:22.02]It's probably like an eight too.
[99:30.14]That's pretty good.
[99:30.92]That's pretty high.
[99:31.70]I did give it five booms.
[99:34.40]Yeah, but booms are on like a different scale than review bra.
[99:36.82]Like review bra does not do 10 out of 10s.
[99:39.58]Almost ever.
[99:48.93]We need to kill these guys.
[99:57.85]Excellent.
[99:59.43]Ooh, wow.
[100:01.41]Ooh, that's actually kind of incredible for you.
[100:03.65]Yeah, that's kind of an attack power level 14.
[100:06.23]I think might be worth some money.
[100:18.22]I'm binding it now.
[100:21.53]I don't believe in the auction house.
[100:22.97]No, seriously.
[100:23.45]I'm kind of glad they have a no auction house rule because I would never ever level.
[100:28.29]I would just camp the auction house and like scalp shit.
[100:34.09]I would be an auction house scalper.
[100:35.73]I mean, that's half the fun of the auction houses.
[100:44.80]Trading for stuff.
[100:50.32]Finding a good deal.
[100:53.81]Hello, ladies, gentlemen, and everyone watching.
[100:57.05]Have you been watching?
[101:00.42]This is Running On Empty Food Review.
[101:04.64]It's actually a pretty good impression.
[101:11.81]Have you been watching?
[101:13.39]Usually, that means you may have been watching a lot of these recently.
[101:17.41]I haven't seen all the recent ones.
[101:19.33]I've seen a couple.
[101:27.17]I need to catch up.
[101:28.45]There's been some, there's been some good looking thumbnails lately.
[101:35.27]Are you healing me?
[101:36.63]Yeah.
[101:37.19]You're the tank.
[101:38.39]How far away can you like do that?
[101:40.77]It's pretty far.
[101:41.51]It's as long as, um, I think it's at least whatever range to max ranges.
[101:49.83]Cause I can do to you here.
[101:52.39]Do we want to get the buffs?
[101:56.45]Which one?
[101:57.78]If we want to go back to Org real quick, we can get Onyxia and probably Rind.
[102:03.68]Let's do that.
[102:05.29]I'm going to Hearth.
[102:09.39]I got an ad break coming up here in a minute.
[102:11.59]I can do that too.
[102:20.02]Just make sure you fly first.
[102:22.00]Mm-hmm.
[102:33.16]We don't get Onyxia here?
[102:34.00]Uh, I don't think you can get Onyxia here.
[102:36.96]I think it has to be Orc.
[102:38.73]Oh, okay.
[102:39.93]Like, Rind, unless I'm stupid, Rind is a bunch of places.
[102:51.83]Uh, but yeah, this fight will take about a few minutes.
[102:55.55]Uh... I think I need to clean my mouse a little better than I did.
[103:00.48]It's still kind of greasy.
[103:06.36]Way to go, Etalyx.
[103:08.04]You want to run an ad?
[103:08.86]You got an opportunity right here.
[103:14.45]I could for 30%.
[103:15.17]Ads are playing now.
[103:25.01]Look, I don't clean my mouse until the gamer gunk gets solidified enough that you can scrape it off with your fingernail.
[103:34.00]And then I'll clean it.
[103:36.85]Alright, I'm going to grab my, I'm going to get an actual wet napkin this time, not half wet, half dry.
[103:42.75]Ripek?
[103:44.41]No, I wasn't talking about 30% of your ad.
[103:47.54]I was saying like that would be the split without the proper settings.
[103:59.72]Which is all public information chat.
[104:20.13]look you can't tell how do you how do you know that gamer gunk is there unless you can see it and if you can see it you can scrape it right nobody nobody here cleans their mouths like every week
[105:26.77]Alright, listen, chat.
[105:27.65]Spot check right now.
[105:30.07]Go stand by the wall.
[105:31.27]We're going to do a full inspection of your room, alright?
[105:33.93]You don't have time to clear out the, like, four KFC cups that are sitting right there by your other monitor, okay?
[105:41.15]You don't have time to take the plates that have currently been stacked by size, with the biggest plates at the bottom and the smaller plates on top, hidden under the bed.
[105:50.70]Spot check.
[106:03.17]I know you're using that Burger King bag as a trash can because your actual trash can is overflowing.
[106:29.47]Some of you don't clean anything until the, like, Coke cans start attracting ants.
[106:48.82]Yeah, I mean, my, um... I rule a thumb for cleaning.
[106:53.62]Like, 20 seconds, and then we can talk about it.
[107:12.27]Alright.
[107:12.87]When is this going to drop?
[107:13.85]Like two minutes?
[107:15.67]Uh, yeah.
[107:16.21]I mean, supposedly in like two minutes.
[107:17.77]Yeah.
[107:20.08]Unless the guild chat was lying.
[107:21.72]Cool.
[107:24.06]Alright.
[107:24.58]So what's your routine?
[107:26.24]Uh, the rule of thumb for me to clean is, uh, when the first moment that I get really angry at knocking over whatever the trash is, that's on the desk.
[107:38.31]That first time when you knock those two or three cans over and you go, what the
[107:43.22]No, that's it.
[107:44.70]That's when you start to clean it up.
[107:48.70]See, I'm pretty good about the cups and the cans and the debris.
[107:54.02]There's no bags or plates for me.
[107:56.10]However, there is a lot of dust and dust comes from people.
[108:01.85]But I am allergic to cleaning.
[108:04.56]Like, anytime I clean, I have the worst fucking day.
[108:08.70]Ever.
[108:09.56]Really?
[108:10.44]Yeah, if I vacuum, like, I need to get, like, a special super-filtered vacuum.
[108:16.04]Like, dust bunnies and, like, dust mites is my number one allergen.
[108:20.35]And I have to go sit on the couch afterward and stare at the ceiling to stop blowing my nose.
[108:26.39]And, like, my eyes start to swell.
[108:28.91]I have to take Benadryl.
[108:31.52]And then I get KO'd.
[108:37.90]Yeah, that's awful.
[108:41.88]You got an air filter, though.
[108:43.36]That's the thing about Vegas, too, is Vegas is so dusty that you'll clean and you'll notice, not even an hour or two later, is what looks like little glitter sparkles all over everything again.
[108:56.47]And you could put your finger and go, well, that's, yep, there it is.
[109:00.40]The problem is, like, the majority of vacuums spew dust into the air.
[109:05.78]Like, the way that the... Even if you have, like, a fresh filter on it, like, it doesn't matter.
[109:11.20]So you have to get, like, a special sealed chamber vacuum.
[109:19.76]Yeah, you can... You can get some pretty good filters, though, that help a lot.
[109:30.01]Stop being weak.
[109:33.27]Breathe in the dust.
[109:35.03]Oh, I was reading that from chat, by the way.
[109:41.16]That wasn't saying that to you.
[109:45.52]That just sounded like I said that to you.
[109:59.76]I, I have a weak immune system.
[110:02.04]Okay.
[110:03.06]I have a, I have a weak, I, I'm allergic to over 90% of the allergens in the Las Vegas Valley.
[110:09.30]The, um, allergist told me I only have one month out of the entire year where I'm at like average.
[110:19.44]I, I need a bubble.
[110:20.37]I feel like allergens.
[110:29.51]I hate knowing that they're around because then you overthink it and you get freaked out by it.
[110:33.93]How many times have you caught the light coming through and you see just how much shit's floating in the air and you... Oh, oh, oh God.
[110:40.89]You start, you cover your mouth.
[110:42.11]You put your, you know, put your shirt over your face.
[110:44.64]Oh God, this is bad.
[110:48.54]And then you clean and you clean all over the place.
[110:50.74]You turn on a fan, you open the windows.
[110:53.06]Oh, this feels so much better.
[110:54.06]The whole, the whole entire room is clean.
[110:57.06]The whole house is clean.
[110:58.02]The whole apartment is clean, whatever.
[111:00.18]And then you get that view again and it's still there.
[111:09.89]Like I got the full, um, test where they poke you with every single possible allergen.
[111:19.10]and they were they they the doctor walked back then and was like oh shit you're allergic to everything where's this buff
[111:46.72]uh I don't know like type in all caps in guild chat I think that's perfect
[112:12.93]What is the Onyxia?
[112:14.03]Is it?
[112:14.39]I can't find it.
[112:15.23]You're supposed to be looking for it.
[112:20.45]Because I think somebody has to like manually turn in.
[112:27.91]So they're probably just like either late or waiting for someone in particular to get there.
[112:32.51]This is going to be really awful to look at, isn't it?
[112:39.38]Going to strike every single person here with lightning.
[113:02.44]You should play Orc Massage.
[113:03.82]It's a wicked funny.
[113:04.74]The orcs gossip about goblins and warlocks.
[113:07.11]It's funny.
[113:09.33]I already know what that game is.
[113:10.48]Ster already talked to me about it.
[113:34.53]oof there it is alright let's go utilize this uh if you sit for an extra minute you'll get rend oh they usually they almost always do it at the same time one time I sat here for two minutes after onyxia and was like okay I guess that's it and I left and no sooner had I stepped outside of org rend dropped right behind me
[114:01.83]So, like, if it catches you while you're on the flight path, you just won't get it.
[114:09.60]You laugh like Elmo after puberty.
[114:14.72]There's a 22-month sub that said that.
[114:18.12]Don't come in here acting like you never... Don't come in here acting like this is the first time you ever heard me laugh.
[114:27.53]Elmo, um...
[114:32.02]Elmo's lifespan is incredibly long.
[114:36.36]How old is Elmo?
[114:37.20]I think he's in his 40s.
[114:37.82]He's like a 45-year-old man.
[114:38.38]He's four?
[114:38.78]He's three?
[114:42.28]I thought he was 40.
[115:05.42]Am I making it up or did they cancel Sesame Street?
[115:10.15]No, HBO I think bought it and there it is.
[115:13.89]Oh, well, how old is Mr. Noodle?
[115:18.30]Now you're going to tell me Mr. Noodle is four.
[115:33.49]It's on HBO, but I feel like they've been trying to cancel it.
[115:36.07]Fuck, I just did the Elmo laugh again.
[115:43.39]No, don't do this to me.
[115:58.26]Don't do this to me.
[115:59.00]Now I'm gonna think about this every time I laugh.
[116:05.84]Now it's Butthead.
[116:06.40]Uh-oh.
[116:10.24]Tal, you gotta save me here.
[116:11.34]Say anything.
[116:18.73]Elmo loves... Okay, I can't do it.
[116:21.61]I can do a pretty good Elmo.
[116:23.59]Since I turned 40, I can't do it anymore.
[116:25.51]It's Hardman.
[116:25.95]It's close.
[116:37.79]No.
[116:39.05]Elmo says this really sounds like when Elmo eats a cheesesteak.
[116:42.09]Elmo's voice gets a little deeper, but Elmo says he's your friend.
[116:50.94]Smoker Elmo.
[116:52.52]It's cheesesteak Elmo.
[116:55.72]No.
[117:05.99]The laugh is really good.
[117:17.82]Alright, so we are buffed beyond belief.
[117:21.58]So these quillbores should not be a problem anymore.
[117:23.60]We should fly to Taraho.
[117:24.34]It's a long walk.
[117:31.79]Good time to run whaling caverns with these.
[117:41.01]Did you go to Ratchet?
[117:43.09]No, I did Taraho.
[117:47.73]I think it's 20.
[117:49.67]At least we need to make sure that Talos is running.
[117:52.39]21, 22.
[118:02.86]Yeah.
[118:23.24]it is almost 10 o'clock I think uh all impressions come out before 9 30. yeah I mean especially not including Elmo but if you want to do an impression of like a deeper voice character then the closer you are to when you woke up is that's key like the further you get from that the harder deep voice impressions get
[118:47.59]Yeah, sometimes I remember recording videos back in, this is 2012, 2013.
[118:52.89]Right when you got up in the morning, like you said, it'd be, get me in front of that microphone.
[118:58.43]And here we go.
[118:59.39]Now I've got one of these voices and it sounds incredible.
[119:02.43]And it's, it's just barely, I'd woken up and I had a glass of water and it's perfect.
[119:10.66]I remember you used to be on, like, Skype or something, and you would get, like, I don't know what to call it, a frog in your voice or whatever, like a little sound change, and try to keep that for as long as you possibly could.
[119:24.20]Mm-hmm.
[119:37.89]Yeah, I still do that.
[119:42.80]And it's still just as magical every time.
[119:44.92]It's something that just never gets old.
[119:47.82]It's just like a bubble in your throat.
[119:50.54]It's the Tom Hanks voice.
[119:56.46]Isn't Skype gone forever?
[119:57.56]Didn't they shut it down today or yesterday?
[120:01.12]I think so.
[120:06.62]Good.
[120:09.67]I didn't honestly didn't even know it was still going.
[120:13.08]Are you following a different warrior?
[120:15.07]No.
[120:16.57]We have to walk this way.
[120:18.11]This is where the Quilboars are.
[120:19.19]They look just like me.
[120:22.05]I don't want to aggro a bunch of monsters.
[120:35.01]Yeah, Skype, um... Skype was terrible.
[120:39.44]Like, it was good that it existed when it did, but...
[120:42.79]Specifically, do you remember that if somebody got your Skype username, they could get your IP address and DDoS you?
[120:51.70]It had a lot of problems.
[120:53.00]That's one of the main reasons why we use TeamSpeak and Vint.
[120:58.26]Yeah, especially pretty early on.
[121:01.76]I will say, though, that Skype kind of crawled so everybody else could walk, I think.
[121:07.76]Because features like screen share, that was unheard of.
[121:10.65]That was brand new to Skype.
[121:13.63]I think they kind of walked so everybody else could run.
[121:16.17]Because now it's so easy.
[121:23.69]Just Discord, screen share and streaming and... I remember doing Skype screen share and watching people like you play games.
[121:31.99]What the fuck is attacking me?
[121:35.69]Oh.
[121:36.79]I just froze.
[121:39.32]I'm not cut out for it.
[121:40.28]I froze.
[121:45.49]Those are good too.
[121:51.72]I like how there's still one TeamSpeak employee and they just run the like public relations Twitter account.
[122:00.50]And keep like threatening the return of TeamSpeak.
[122:15.76]I gotta get the new Shadow Bolt.
[122:17.06]I think the better one's... I think it's 100 damage at level 20.
[122:23.25]Bring back the Game Spy Launcher.
[122:27.91]Oh, God.
[122:39.23]I remember that thing used to take... I gotta get my Clan Match and Medal of Honor.
[122:44.24]Am I crazy or did that thing used to take two to three minutes to open and close and stuff?
[122:50.85]It was a weird program.
[122:55.13]It would be in the taskbar and it would just be running so shittily.
[122:59.67]I remember just having to reinstall it.
[123:02.68]Oh yeah, no, it sucked.
[123:04.10]But it was my first, like, probably gateway into online games.
[123:11.28]I was playing like Medal of Honor.
[123:12.81]I was playing Call of Duty.
[123:14.39]All grats.
[123:15.45]Let's go.
[123:23.87]We'll get to 20 today for sure.
[123:29.17]Yeah, I'm like a quarter of the way there.
[123:30.79]I think 20 is the good point to be ready.
[123:46.13]spending hours trying to figure out how to start your own server on like a hamachi it progressed so quickly too because what we're talking about was really not that long ago it really wasn't we're talking about eight or nine maybe ten years total eight years is when this was really kind of all going down
[124:14.25]Hasn't been 20 years.
[124:15.43]It's been seven or eight.
[124:17.03]2012, 2013.
[124:19.28]2017.
[124:19.30]Oh, my God.
[124:19.74]How long ago is it?
[124:20.36]It's been a while.
[124:31.28]It was 13 years ago.
[124:43.08]oh my god I mean 2017 was eight years ago it's going too fast my inventory is full of garbage forgot to sell
[125:13.06]Also, these tusks take up a stack per 20, and we need 60, so it's like three spaces.
[125:18.71]But you know what?
[125:19.47]I'm sure if you have all rune cloths, that's not a problem.
[125:30.91]He did the Elmo voice, he did it.
[125:39.64]Wicked witch energy.
[125:46.48]Dude, I saw the Wizard of Oz in 4K HD with an OLED with HDR on.
[125:56.45]I have never seen more beautiful red smoke in my entire life.
[126:01.57]Did TV started smoking?
[126:07.04]Yeah, dude, it would get heated up so bad.
[126:13.91]The Wicked Witch is smoking.
[126:17.51]No, no, no.
[126:18.46]It was this vibrant, unbelievably awesome red smoke.
[126:28.62]All the scenes where the Wicked Witch is landing or flying away.
[126:33.31]She goes to Munchkin Town.
[126:34.49]She terrorizes the place for a minute.
[126:36.47]When she comes in, if you have Dolby Vision with an OLED monitor and HDR...
[126:44.96]I just wanted to walk through it so bad.
[126:48.48]I- I was a munchkin.
[126:52.18]And uh, our school did a, like, play of The Wizard of Oz.
[126:57.82]And I was one of the munchkins.
[127:04.08]And I had to sing the Lollipop Guild theme song.
[127:09.95]You probably crushed it.
[127:11.51]And it was like, we represent the Lollipop Guild.
[127:18.35]I'm glad you did that and not me.
[127:19.85]Because I was thinking about it, but I was like, I'm not doing it.
[127:22.10]And then you did it.
[127:23.08]So I'm glad you did that so you could take the heat away from me.
[127:30.66]And it was me and two other people.
[127:31.98]It was our only job.
[127:33.00]I need some help.
[127:33.92]Oh, God.
[127:48.75]Yeah, uh, turn around and run.
[127:52.15]Let the Voidwalker die.
[127:53.01]Just turn around and run.
[127:54.15]Oh, actually we only got one.
[127:56.45]We're fine.
[127:58.85]If we- Oh, we got- No, we're good.
[128:01.89]We're good.
[128:07.53]That person just wrote Omega.
[128:08.75]Didn't even put an Omega lull or anything.
[128:10.53]Omega what?
[128:12.16]Omega what?
[128:12.66]We need to know!
[128:34.63]Okay.
[128:34.83]45.
[128:34.95]How many do you have?
[128:37.37]50.
[128:47.06]Omega Elmo.
[128:52.58]Omega Elmuel.
[128:56.27]That's an emote that nobody's done.
[128:58.05]What's going on with that?
[129:08.95]I have an emote that is um it's omega not funny and it's the omega LOL but with their mouth like closed oh shit somebody said how's my laundry doing I didn't turn the laundry over for two days
[129:34.77]It was even in my stream title and I didn't do it.
[129:39.06]That sucks.
[129:40.18]I gotta do that.
[129:48.40]It's gonna be stuck to the walls.
[129:53.43]That's gonna be like paper mache.
[130:04.01]like you you ever leave your laundry in so long that you just like say fuck it I'm just gonna run the whole cycle again yeah it sucks though I hate when that happens you gotta just get it done when it's done and go
[130:22.29]Whoever invents the laundry dryer twofer, where the clothes just get dumped into a dryer compartment that's in the same unit.
[130:31.45]They have two-in-ones now, but they're like all like AI driven.
[130:34.87]This already exists?
[130:37.23]They already do that?
[130:38.48]Yeah, there is a two-in-one now.
[130:41.98]It's got to be a piece of shit though, right?
[130:44.02]Any brand new technology like that, the first one sucks.
[130:46.70]And then like five years later, it's good.
[130:59.13]They take forever.
[131:11.61]Some efficiency washers have a one-hour spin cycle that leaves the clothes almost dry.
[131:16.16]Now I'm gonna make everybody laugh at me again when I give this take.
[131:24.96]I um okay you know we talk about the oven the oven's weird the microwave is weird you're gonna have to fill me in because I don't know what the hell you're talking about you just went like alright everybody knows my take on the the oven is weird it's true okay um that's a long story though uh uh
[131:49.68]I'm very particular about appliances.
[131:51.52]They freak me out.
[131:52.22]Some of them, I think, are strange.
[131:54.38]They operate weirdly.
[131:55.30]I think it's just... I use the oven all the time.
[132:00.51]But the concept of having a box that's in your wall that heats up to 500 degrees is just a little... That's kind of weird.
[132:09.45]That's a weird thing we've invented that works.
[132:12.59]How do you feel about water heaters?
[132:14.77]Yeah, I mean, it's all kind of weird.
[132:17.97]Um, the spin cycle on the laundry is another one of those things for me.
[132:24.19]Cause you'll, it sounds like a plane is just taking off in your house.
[132:27.37]Oh yeah.
[132:27.85]I mean, it's like a, it's like a 30, like a 20 pound tumbler that's just spinning at like 5,000 RPM.
[132:33.56]So I don't think I want that going for an hour.
[132:38.24]For an hour?
[132:38.64]No way.
[132:46.74]Okay, but like, if car tires exist, then that's probably fine, right?
[132:54.50]That's... Yeah.
[132:57.76]You're going to get me with the gotcha.
[132:58.80]I know you are.
[133:02.33]Tire pressure, I know what you mean.
[133:04.73]Yeah, guys, a whipped cream can kind of scares me because look at all the pressure in there.
[133:20.02]What about a blender?
[133:29.03]What about the theme park ride where you spin yourself on the disk in the teacups?
[133:34.65]Those are based.
[133:41.58]Sometimes I do feel like I, I, I, my soul is from like 1500 or something.
[133:50.99]You ever hear that theory, Etalyx?
[133:52.85]Would you, would you, would you be, are you, are you suggesting you might be one of the people trying to like, like would you be a witch hunter?
[134:00.46]No, no.
[134:09.72]I just like, okay, you know, Trelawney from Red Dead Redemption 2.
[134:15.16]I can't believe how much fun.
[134:16.96]I just want to sell snake oil and smoke long cigarettes and wear a top hat.
[134:20.96]You want to be a snake oil salesman?
[134:25.75]Well, I mean, not to that extent.
[134:30.35]You just said I want to sell snake oil.
[134:32.93]Yeah, but mine would have good properties in it.
[134:45.92]I would sell peppermint tea.
[134:48.14]Here we have the peppermint tea.
[134:50.58]Arthur, try it.
[134:52.32]I'm sure you'll love it.
[134:54.16]It's good for the digestive system.
[134:55.80]Okay, but is thinking that you're a snake oil salesman in another life an indictment of streamers?
[135:04.50]I guess here I am right now.
[135:16.76]That brings us to our sponsor today, Factor.
[135:21.09]Use code JermJermJerm for 25% off.
[135:35.03]I need one.
[135:35.97]No, you need one more.
[135:42.16]Okay, I need one more because they keep dropping in twos and I can't fit two in my bag.
[135:49.09]So I'm trying to figure out how to get just one.
[135:51.69]I think I can just hand... I think you can... Can you not split it?
[135:56.25]I'm trying to figure out what the fuck I can just delete from my bags.
[135:59.63]I just took that guy's entire... That guy, I took all of his milk and cookies.
[136:02.56]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[136:04.36]I took that guy's shirt, his food, his milk...
[136:08.65]Imagine drinking the milk out of somebody's hand.
[136:10.73]Imagine fighting a guy with milk in your hand.
[136:14.78]These quillboards don't... Don't say that.
[136:18.24]What?
[136:19.38]What?
[136:24.53]Like a glass of milk.
[136:26.63]Don't out of context semantics Andy me.
[136:31.77]That goes for all of you.
[136:37.80]Okay, but, like, sometimes you're... we're the same way, like, I'm doing something in my inventory, and then, like, I'm trying to, like, figure that shit out, and then I tune... my ears tune back in, you know what I'm saying?
[136:52.20]Yeah, there are just apparently... Okay, there are some things that are just off limits.
[136:55.20]If you say the word milk... What?
[136:58.13]Milk?
[136:58.79]What did he say?
[137:00.09]Milk?
[137:01.03]He's going to say man milk.
[137:03.95]That's what he meant.
[137:04.75]He meant man milk.
[137:05.79]He said milk.
[137:06.45]He had milk in his hands.
[137:07.88]That means man milk.
[137:09.00]He jerked off.
[137:12.80]Correct.
[137:26.66]look we don't we don't control what makes us laugh okay that's that's the number one like comedy rule that's fair oh this one got me and I somebody said why would auto say that
[137:50.57]Yes, it's me!
[137:51.85]Oh my god.
[137:52.54]Guys, I have two voices.
[137:54.94]You hear one of them every 45 minutes.
[138:06.09]We gotta kill two more Geomancers and we're good.
[138:14.99]We may have lost the plot.
[138:16.96]How did we get from Elmo to this?
[138:20.29]I don't know.
[138:20.89]I love these late streams where it does... Dude, I don't even care anymore.
[138:26.89]We played Dracula and... You know, somebody made like plenty of those jokes.
[138:41.87]These are retired activities.
[138:50.81]No, these have been great.
[138:53.23]I'm having a good time.
[139:03.86]I think we're good.
[139:04.32]I want to try to get one of these Sunskill feathers.
[139:10.70]Not run right through everything.
[139:15.47]That would be bad.
[139:20.85]Feathers from what?
[139:23.45]Sunscale Angry Scythe Claws.
[139:29.53]Can you share this quest?
[139:33.08]I hope so.
[139:34.40]It says you're already on it.
[139:36.36]Oh.
[139:38.84]These dudes don't have a quest highlight for me.
[139:42.30]I think it's raptors.
[139:46.39]I just don't want to run through these guys.
[139:51.97]Carefully.
[139:54.41]Carefully.
[139:56.84]Carefully.
[139:57.32]So, okay, you said ovens are weird, and that was not the point.
[140:09.93]That was like a supporting point.
[140:12.45]What was the main thing?
[140:15.68]main thing is spinning clothes in the washing machine I it freaks me out I don't like it okay I got you so I can tolerate that for 10 to 15 minutes but yeah somebody in chat said that they have washing machines that do a one hour spin cycle and it pretty much dries all of your clothes so I said I don't want to do that you ever had one of those dryers that like moves by itself because of the the rotation of the can canister
[140:45.36]Moves by itself.
[140:46.20]What do you mean?
[140:47.00]Yeah, like the... Like it shakes the entire machine.
[140:52.62]Oh, yeah.
[140:55.30]No, no, no, no, no.
[141:00.37]Yeah, it just starts walking.
[141:01.41]I remember visiting my family.
[141:13.61]And we're talking to my mother and I'm going to the laundry room.
[141:19.46]And it was... The washer and dryer is doing that.
[141:23.62]Like, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[141:25.30]Like, bouncing around and stuff.
[141:26.28]But that had to have been from, like, the 90s.
[141:27.74]And we're being like, Ma, this is... How old is this dryer?
[141:32.67]Oh, it's fine.
[141:34.63]It works.
[141:35.77]I'm just like, Ma.
[141:39.79]Yeah, my mother, um...
[141:42.60]If the, like, washing machine or, like, the dryer would break down, she would, like, instead of calling someone to repair or getting a new one, she would look up, like, multiple YouTube videos to figure out how to fix it herself.
[141:54.92]And it's like, you can't be moving the entire dryer.
[141:57.72]Like, that's too much work.
[142:01.33]She's like, no, it's okay.
[142:02.99]And she would fix it every single time.
[142:04.65]Like, it'd be fixed.
[142:10.50]Well, it's better than, I guess, buying a new one, right?
[142:13.26]Yeah, and like, I'm too stupid to fix it.
[142:15.14]Now, I would have tried, at least, you know, if I still lived.
[142:18.94]I am not a handyman.
[142:21.48]Oh, me neither.
[142:22.24]We're streamers.
[142:23.42]We ain't fooling anybody.
[142:24.85]I watch a lot of Red Green.
[142:27.07]And... I live vicariously through that comedy show.
[142:31.51]Because I'll never be a handyman.
[142:33.29]That show is wonderful.
[142:35.33]Well, what's the tagline?
[142:37.11]Um...
[142:38.74]If you can't be handsome, then you better be handy.
[142:57.70]If your wife doesn't think you're handsome, then hopefully she thinks you're handy.
[143:01.76]I think it's, uh, if you can't be handsome, you better be funny.
[143:14.22]Can you explain this to me or somebody explain this to me?
[143:17.17]Why Canada seems to have the world's funniest people in the world?
[143:24.65]Why does every funny creative person come from Canada?
[143:32.94]That's a good question.
[143:37.39]Think about a ton of the big, famous, famous, massive comedians that are beloved.
[143:42.19]A lot of them are Canadian.
[143:47.66]Mike Myers, Jim Carrey.
[143:52.08]Steve Smith, who is red-green.
[143:56.75]John Candy.
[143:57.73]The whole Second City group, John Candy.
[144:02.63]Catherine O'Hara.
[144:05.07]I think that, I think, no, no, no.
[144:06.71]They're, uh, it's the free healthcare.
[144:24.66]Is, is, Catherine O'Hara is Canadian, right?
[144:28.54]There was a whole comedy troupe that was, um, Rick Moranis.
[144:42.60]Maybe I just vibe with the Canadian style humor.
[144:46.37]I imagine you're selling things.
[144:59.14]I am indeed.
[145:07.18]Look, I don't know, I don't know anything about Canada, except I really, I would like to go sometime.
[145:12.06]Like they have beautiful countryside, some, some stellar, uh, places to visit as a tourist.
[145:22.21]Some, some amazing hotels and like nestled in the mountains and buried in like the snowy forest, like a winter wonderland.
[145:31.88]Yeah.
[145:32.04]Canada's beautiful.
[145:32.70]I've been to Canada a few times.
[145:35.68]It's gorgeous.
[145:47.75]Got to open these clams.
[145:54.72]But yeah, I guess my point is, is every time there's a comedian or a famous actor or something that I go, oh, wow, that person's so funny.
[146:02.38]Let's go to their Wikipedia page.
[146:03.60]I'm curious about them.
[146:05.24]Born in Ontario, Canada.
[146:07.16]Like, oh, okay.
[146:08.77]Damn.
[146:11.89]Yeah.
[146:28.40]Let me open my clams.
[146:38.60]I have never been to Vancouver, no.
[146:41.33]Ah, potential customer!
[146:47.27]Glad I could help!
[146:56.76]Toronto, you spent a week in Toronto.
[146:58.10]It was awesome.
[146:59.36]Alex, you've been to Canada, like Toronto or Ontario?
[147:02.26]I've never been to Canada, but it's nice that like we can say, you know, like in baseball, we have the World Series.
[147:11.10]The reason it's not the American Series is because Canada is part of it, you know, and they're a country in the world.
[147:18.93]So like if we have a world championship, it's because Canada is always there.
[147:23.71]Like Toronto.
[147:24.29]Toronto.
[147:29.28]Maybe I'll do a Canada trip one day and just kind of tour the major.
[147:34.48]Canada's huge.
[147:40.79]Alright, we can try to get these.
[147:43.89]Still need a feather from these guys.
[147:47.63]The only bad thing I've heard about Canada is that you, wait, I can't remember if it was about Canada.
[147:53.93]I think it was about Canada that you're not supposed to go to like the Canadian side of Niagara or something.
[148:01.34]That's like the only negative thing I've ever like heard from Canadians.
[148:04.98]They're like, don't.
[148:07.86]Any Canadians want to confirm or deny?
[148:29.08]uh it's not so bad that's the American side of the falls I thought I thought I heard look I'm not trying to start any any I just thought I heard that like the canadian side is like filled with billboards and I got one on this uh this guy if you don't okay
[148:57.62]and go to crossroads turn this in fly to taraho turn it in I I've heard that they just like both suck and that niagara is like a beautiful fall that's been ruined by everyone who tries to build around it look on a tourist trap
[149:28.63]Yeah, I would highly recommend, you know, I found this show recently and I can't even believe I'd never heard of it.
[149:33.47]I brought it up once a couple of days ago, but it's called the Red Green Show.
[149:38.41]There's 300 episodes.
[149:42.11]You, I mean, you did just mention it, but also I haven't seen any of it, so I don't, I don't even know what it is.
[149:47.96]So you can, you can give me the pitch.
[149:49.76]So it's a, it's a show that's in front of a live audience and it's a variety kind of show where they have, it's this lodge, I think it's called the Possum Lodge.
[150:00.40]And there's five or six goofy characters that work and do things at the lodge.
[150:06.75]So one of them's the sewer, septic kind of guy.
[150:10.19]One's the kind of like an assistant and the other one and then there's Red Green who's the kind of main person at the lodge.
[150:18.52]And they do these segments where he will jokingly put together DIY just weirdo shit.
[150:27.08]Yeah, and he's always using duct tape.
[150:28.42]He's duct tapes.
[150:29.68]Like I told you, one of my favorite ones is he made an air hockey table with two dryers.
[150:34.79]He just poked a bunch of holes in the dryers and put like a bunch of shit on top to have holes.
[150:40.81]And it was great.
[150:42.33]You just kind of got to watch it.
[150:44.16]So it's not a Halo machinima.
[150:47.32]No, it is.
[150:47.90]It's not.
[150:51.87]And he's really quick.
[150:52.71]There's a lot of jokes.
[150:55.27]The jokes are very, very boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[150:58.06]And they always land.
[150:59.88]Very rarely does one not land.
[151:07.42]They play these word games with each other and it's just all joke after joke.
[151:16.29]How long are the episodes?
[151:17.37]Is it like an online, just like a YouTube show?
[151:20.06]It's an old show from the mid-90s into the early 2000s.
[151:24.07]Oh, I mean, people... It's nice that those have been archived at least, probably.
[151:31.45]Can you watch them on YouTube now?
[151:34.17]Yeah, I think almost all of them are there.
[151:38.53]What happened to the sitcom?
[151:44.09]It kind of just, I don't know.
[151:45.89]It just, they didn't really hit anymore.
[151:48.07]Uh, this is not a sitcom though.
[151:49.15]This is a, I'd call this a comedy variety show.
[151:54.29]It's like a handyman theme.
[152:00.00]I think recently, uh, as late as early as whatever, 2019 or 2020, uh, Steve Smith, the guy who does red green, they did a final goodbye tour, a live tour, I think.
[152:15.06]And you know when you find something and you go, wow, this is really cool.
[152:20.12]And you go, wow, I wonder if there's more of this.
[152:22.53]And you realize they did their finale tour four or five years ago.
[152:27.89]You say, oh, shit.
[152:30.15]Oh, I missed it.
[152:32.09]You just missed the heyday.
[152:41.46]I've been putting Dom just to relax to and essentially fall asleep to.
[152:45.84]It's good fall sleep to content.
[152:47.54]And not because it's boring, but it's just cozy.
[152:50.02]The show is very cozy.
[153:01.83]How much impact do you think young Sheldon had on killing the sitcom? 85%.
[153:23.95]Young Sheldon.
[153:33.27]I think you meant like 85.33.
[153:35.33]Repeating, of course.
[153:37.77]That was a perfect Young Sheldon follow-up joke.
[153:41.27]And that's going to get a +2 from me.
[153:47.30]We got to go this way.
[153:50.85]I don't know what quest we're doing.
[153:52.35]I'm just trusting that we're on the right track.
[153:55.89]I feel like normally in these kind of games, I'm the one who's like, alright, follow me.
[154:01.68]But in World of Warcraft, it's like role reversal.
[154:06.76]As much as I'm not paying 100% attention right now, I've been in the barrens many times.
[154:32.74]Good XP.
[154:39.43]good xp okay so now this this gives you a kind of a fake rend buff you just have to bring yeah for like a few minutes right I think it's like 10 to 20 minutes yeah there's no reason not to use them all
[155:10.67]okay so now we can take our new wonderful buffs especially the speed one and we go back down where we just we're gonna kill the leaders you've seen house people are asking about house I've yeah I've seen most of house I've only seen like what's on TV
[155:38.74]Like when it just like a random episode appears and like I watched the whole thing, but I need to watch like the whole show.
[155:47.53]I watched the first three or four seasons.
[155:50.53]And then I stopped really caring about it.
[155:52.17]And I picked it back up.
[155:55.75]And.
[155:55.97]I really only remember the first three or four seasons.
[156:00.25]Honestly, it got wild.
[156:01.47]It really got weird.
[156:05.46]They injected a lot more drama, personal drama into the show that I wasn't really, didn't really like.
[156:14.15]I liked when he was solving mysteries and then they kind of went crazy with it.
[156:20.35]Yeah, I'm not going to spoil it, but it just like... It's got to be real hard to keep coming up with like episodic mysteries that can be solved in the same episode after like five seasons.
[156:32.27]Yeah, there's only so many medical mysteries, I guess, to solve.
[156:35.39]But I think all in all, still, it's a great show.
[156:38.53]Even the later episodes, it's weird that I thought they got eventually.
[156:42.50]I still think that there's a lot of good episodes still.
[156:55.91]Columbo's great too, yeah.
[156:59.43]Oh my god.
[157:02.78]Watch out for the elite.
[157:04.12]Yep, they're here.
[157:06.83]Watch that right side.
[157:09.19]I'm just going to hug over here for a minute.
[157:18.42]Terrifying.
[157:34.80]You can do these eggs.
[157:38.20]Ah, these guys suck.
[157:39.66]Yeah, this place is actually pretty scary, so we gotta be careful.
[157:43.62]And I feel like it's especially bad for Warrior because you have no AoE.
[157:50.25]Resisted.
[157:58.00]People bringing up Monk.
[157:59.20]It's funny you bring that up.
[158:00.20]My mother calls me Monk.
[158:07.84]I'll get really particular about something and she'll go, oh, she's like, what are you, a monk?
[158:12.34]Because monk is very particular, right?
[158:14.06]Monk is OCD, right?
[158:16.58]Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's his whole thing.
[158:20.78]Like, my mother will, she's visited here a bunch of times and she'll pick up the sponge in the sink and she'll put it down in the sink and I'll go, hold on, hold on a second there, mom.
[158:32.21]That sponge is a little dirty, don't you think?
[158:35.63]And she's like, okay, monk, settle down.
[158:37.94]I kind of am though.
[158:50.30]I kind of, I do that.
[159:00.03]She's trolling you.
[159:00.97]Yeah.
[159:05.20]I got a great relationship with my mother she's great I've recently just been like fantasizing about how much better we had it TV wise back in those days like the day the days of like house and monk like when you watch the TV show that you were into you could be certain that the next season of 24 plus episodes was going to be there in six months after the previous season's finale
[159:38.62]And now, I can't even watch Severance Season 2 because I need to rewatch Season 1 so I can remember what the hell happened.
[159:46.40]Because it's been three years.
[159:48.71]It's been three years?
[159:53.59]I gotta watch somebody's, like, recap YouTube episode.
[159:57.45]Video essay or some shit.
[160:01.56]Is Attack on Titan done yet?
[160:05.60]Yeah, it's been done.
[160:07.19]Oh shit, hold on, we got aggro.
[160:10.51]Are we going to die to Silithid Swarmers?
[160:13.63]Maybe, this place is actually really dangerous.
[160:30.06]Yeah, Attack on Titan's done.
[160:34.96]Because I remember... four years ago... Uh-huh.
[160:40.09]We had a conversation about it, and it was the final season.
[160:47.19]And then they did the final season part two.
[160:50.41]And then they did the final season for real this time.
[160:52.67]And then I gave up.
[160:57.04]And I said, you know what?
[160:57.70]I'm just gonna come back in five years.
[161:00.14]And it's been five years, and you're telling me it's done.
[161:03.53]I don't think it was five years ago.
[161:06.59]It was less than that.
[161:07.43]Am I embellishing?
[161:12.35]It's like five years ago, I was still living in the old house.
[161:21.61]Alex, five years ago was 2022.
[161:23.20]No way.
[161:38.19]It was 2022 in COVID time.
[161:39.97]What about Always Sunny?
[161:54.44]Is Always Sunny still going?
[161:55.38]I feel like that's one that's still operating and people still love it.
[162:03.24]Uh, I don't know.
[162:04.34]You always saw like more of that.
[162:09.08]You always like, you need to watch this.
[162:10.56]And I just never wanted to like start season one, even though every time I ever watched like a random episode, uh, I loved it.
[162:18.29]That could be the best comedy show ever made.
[162:21.27]It's very possible.
[162:26.01]Some of these are 22.
[162:27.05]We should probably come back here later.
[162:28.63]Honestly, some of these are 22, 21.
[162:33.36]The spawn rate sucks on these anyways.
[162:39.44]Curb.
[162:40.02]Yeah, Curb is another one.
[162:42.96]I'd say Curb.
[162:44.52]Always Sunny.
[162:45.16]There's definitely a top five here, and they're both in it.
[162:56.05]I'm not trying to give the Redditor answer, but my personal favorite comedy show is Community.
[163:04.53]I think that's fair.
[163:05.03]That's a fair answer.
[163:08.37]I don't see anything wrong with that.
[163:14.74]OK, we.
[163:16.76]Need to turn in something at the crossroads.
[163:18.12]I don't know if you're.
[163:22.21]Your hearthstone is up.
[163:24.65]Yeah, it is.
[163:26.07]Yeah, this area is pretty dangerous.
[163:32.70]It's funny because community for me is always sunny for you.
[163:37.85]You've shown me two or three community episodes and I've gone, wow, that was really funny, but I've never really seen the show.
[163:45.96]Yeah, I think that's fair.
[163:47.85]I don't remember which episodes I showed you though.
[163:59.23]Trailer Park Boys.
[164:00.07]Trailer Park Boys is absolutely up there.
[164:05.47]Just because of the one running gag.
[164:10.75]That one gag of, what's his name?
[164:13.24]The guy with the drink in his hand in every scene.
[164:16.14]And they kept it going the entire series.
[164:20.46]It must have been such a pain in the ass.
[164:22.20]Julian, yep.
[164:24.10]What a huge pain in the ass.
[164:26.08]But that's the kind of shit that I think is perfect.
[164:29.24]That is perfect comedy.
[164:33.60]Have you seen Trailer Park Boys?
[164:36.71]uh never a full episode only all of the like clips I've probably seen enough of it just from clips on youtube you know the character I'm talking about julian he's one of the main characters he's he's like the buff he's always got the black shirt on kind of buff guy I don't know all the dude's names I would I could recognize all like if you if you pointed out a bunch of characters and were like are these guys I would be like yeah I don't know their names though
[165:05.71]He's got a goatee, right?
[165:07.63]He has a jacket.
[165:08.59]Is it a Jack and Coke?
[165:12.11]Every... They never dropped it.
[165:14.83]He has a Jack and Coke in his hand with ice in it in every fucking scene.
[165:18.72]Almost in the entire show.
[165:21.56]Even during action sequences, he's running with it in his hand.
[165:30.38]Even in prison.
[165:34.90]That's so funny.
[165:36.83]Oh, that's so funny.
[165:45.89]I gotta watch that show.
[165:47.03]I gotta, I've only, okay, confession, I've only seen maybe 10 episodes of that whole show.
[165:53.39]Fully.
[165:55.11]I need to see that entire show.
[165:57.14]The whole thing.
[166:03.78]Let's go do Raptors.
[166:12.94]I'll get the letter thing up here.
[166:18.83]And then I'm going to take a break and probably this last break of the night.
[166:23.05]I'm getting kind of tired.
[166:26.33]Yeah, we got the how close are you to 20?
[166:29.45]About halfway.
[166:30.61]I think we'll get there.
[166:31.27]About the 30-40 minutes, we should get there.
[166:33.51]Five and a half bars?
[166:34.87]For me?
[166:35.93]Yeah, you'll get there for sure, at least.
[166:39.36]Where is this guy?
[166:39.98]What letter thing are you talking about?
[166:42.12]Where is this guy?
[166:43.58]What the hell are you talking about?
[166:48.10]Oh, he's right here.
[166:50.99]Wait, what?
[166:57.10]What quest was that?
[166:59.28]It was called Letter to Jin Zil.
[167:10.06]Did you complete it or did you pick it up?
[167:13.14]I just picked it up.
[167:14.40]Oh, okay.
[167:14.70]I already picked it up.
[167:15.42]That's why I was confused.
[167:16.30]I thought you were turning it in here.
[167:22.84]Yeah, they want us to go to Stone Talon for that, which having just quested in Stone Talon on the Shaman, I'm now into like, I hate Stone Talon party.
[167:35.98]Yeah, it can be kind of a pain in the ass.
[167:40.11]Oh, the Raptor Nest is down there.
[167:42.43]Okay, well, yeah, we'll probably end on that.
[167:44.45]But I want to take one more break.
[167:45.91]I'm going to get up, stretch.
[167:48.53]I'll be back in three or four minutes.
[167:58.64]It leads to Desolace.
[167:59.52]Yeah, Desolace is even worse.
[168:03.18]I think Desolace is the worst zone on the Horde side.
[168:05.90]It's so all over the place.
[168:06.86]It's so terrifying.
[168:07.59]Alright.
[168:11.47]Last break of the night.
[168:12.41]I'll be right back.
[168:44.32]Did anybody else watch all of How I Met Your Mother when it was on the air except for the second half of the final season so I still don't know how it ended?
[168:59.81]I was just like, this sucks.
[169:01.05]This is bad.
[169:01.81]This is stupid.
[169:02.55]And I just stopped watching and then I never figured it out.
[169:33.67]Okay, here's a very cold take.
[169:37.82]If you can spoil an entire show in one sentence, that show sucks.
[170:58.33]Spoil wow in one sentence.
[171:19.78]Every character is evil.
[171:44.97]spoil Star Wars in one word midichlorians don't do it I haven't gotten to the end yet and alright we're back let's do the raptor quest
[172:26.03]This buff really is crazy.
[172:27.55]140 attack power.
[172:30.93]What is your total attack power?
[172:34.45]My total is 307, so it's like double.
[172:38.41]So are you hitting double damage for every swing you're doing?
[172:47.16]Let's see, because it increases melee weapon damage by 21.9 for me.
[172:51.26]So I guess not including base damage.
[172:57.61]Yeah, I don't want to duel.
[172:58.23]If I duel, what if you get my health down?
[173:01.01]And a zebra bites me on the ass with 10 HP left.
[173:28.57]How do WoW players do this?
[173:30.29]I'm overwhelmed just looking at the UI.
[173:33.66]Well, I've got something to tell you.
[173:35.54]I have probably the most barren UI of any WoW streamer.
[173:47.37]A barren joke?
[173:55.87]Yeah, you may have the fewest add-ons, but you have the highest or lowest resolution.
[174:05.09]The highest DPI per... Highest UI scaling.
[174:09.84]Also, we might have to kill these dudes.
[174:12.66]Yeah.
[174:27.18]mobile game.
[174:28.66]It's a mobile game UI for me?
[174:30.18]No, it's not.
[174:32.82]I think it's clean.
[174:33.89]You can see all the icons.
[174:35.69]If I need to click something, it's not a tiny two by two pixel square.
[174:40.29]It's huge.
[174:42.01]I'm not going to misclick this.
[174:43.41]It's right there.
[174:44.69]And it's gigantic.
[175:07.10]I got so much money.
[175:08.44]Three gold?
[175:09.14]It's gonna be awesome in about two or three levels when I need to spend it all.
[175:29.13]Alright, so we place a feather.
[175:32.57]And I think we have to close up the... There's a few little ditches or something we have to plug up.
[175:47.60]Yeah, you got the eggs and then... The red, yellow, and the blue.
[175:55.37]We might share progress with this.
[175:56.71]Let's find out.
[176:01.89]Did you get that?
[176:03.67]Uh, yeah.
[176:04.33]That counted.
[176:04.75]Okay, cool.
[176:26.44]Oh, you got two.
[176:27.17]Look out.
[176:30.05]Careful.
[176:30.59]Careful here.
[176:38.87]You know, I get clips of the Orville, but I've never seen it.
[176:42.67]It seems funny.
[176:46.71]I've seen that everyone's seen the cigarette routine.
[176:48.89]I think we are done with that.
[177:02.74]Now we can either...
[177:10.11]I'm afraid of that quest.
[177:12.15]We're going to have to go to Stone Talon.
[177:15.29]I mean, we have an option to go to finish up the shit here because we have stolen silver.
[177:24.80]But the Raptor Grounds south of Ratchet, which should be like east of us, maybe.
[177:30.64]Down there.
[177:31.00]Yeah, we can do that.
[177:31.92]Well, let's do that and wrap back up to Ratchet and see where we're at.
[177:41.83]But people seem to like it.
[177:42.91]It seems like a funny show.
[177:45.85]I like Seth MacFarlane.
[177:46.87]I think he's a funny guy.
[177:52.05]Even if you don't like Family Guy, I think Seth MacFarlane is very funny.
[177:59.34]Yeah, I mean... He's a funny writer.
[178:03.56]With anything comedy, some things are going to stick and some things are not.
[178:08.38]And when you put as much like...
[178:10.82]content out as seth mcfarlane has there's people are gonna remember the stuff that didn't stick there's I think there's like a negative bias the first three or four seasons of Family Guy he was writing them and that's what I would consider to be the best version of that show he stopped writing Family Guy and started doing a bunch of other stuff
[178:44.32]Is it an L take?
[178:46.36]Is it an L take for you?
[178:48.14]No.
[179:07.50]Seth MacFarlane never did anything funny in his entire life.
[179:11.76]Oh, W take, W take.
[179:14.52]Hey, stop farming.
[179:16.20]Stop farming.
[179:38.17]Okay, well, the Orville, I just looked over here and people said, hey, it's a great show.
[179:41.47]It's actually really funny.
[179:42.25]It's pretty good.
[179:43.51]500 cigarettes, right?
[179:44.93]That's Seth MacFarlane.
[179:45.83]That's a Seth MacFarlane show.
[179:47.10]Hell take.
[179:51.46]Oh, he's, he has tainted everything he's ever touched with unfunniness.
[180:02.82]Oh, the funniest thing that happens during a Seth MacFarlane show is my internet cutting out.
[180:13.84]People act like they don't like it, but they'll, uh, people are like ashamed to admit that they like it.
[180:18.76]Is that what it is?
[180:29.35]I think that's true of a lot of properties.
[180:32.91]Like, uh, people, people like something and then they realize something about it.
[180:39.21]And then it's like corrupted or they, or they hear like a, like an internet
[180:44.62]kind of take that sticks yeah but I I do I've seen a lot of the Family Guy the last five to ten years a lot of it is dog and I mean like dog oh yeah but there are some moments there are some moments that I do kind of go oh that was actually kind of funny
[181:06.92]I've kind of felt that way about every animated, like, mature comedy short series for the last, like, eight years.
[181:15.49]Where the hell even is this place?
[181:17.91]I think it's down.
[181:18.52]I think we're gonna keep going down.
[181:19.46]I'm gonna fall off.
[181:23.32]I'm gonna die to fall damage.
[181:38.97]Okay, if you don't think Seth MacFarlane's a funny writer, whether you don't like the Orville or what a Family Guy, you do have to admit that he is very, very talented.
[181:49.80]He's very talented.
[181:51.76]And if you don't think he's talented, then I mean, his singing, he has a whole album where he sings.
[181:58.62]Careful up here.
[182:01.32]I mean, look, every time Brian Griffin's on camera, you get the, I've made that joke a million times, but I'm going to fall back on it.
[182:17.62]Yeah, alright.
[182:18.60]We're so far away.
[182:20.18]I was seeing if I could get to the top of this cliff.
[182:23.73]You are going to fall off and die.
[182:25.09]And I'm right there, but I can't make it the rest of the way.
[182:27.53]We're going to watch you fall all the way down.
[182:33.65]Anyway, how could anybody hate the guy who made spawn?
[182:35.65]It's true.
[182:43.74]Yeah, stop doing the GTA thing.
[182:50.78]Yeah, I know that all the mountains you can drive your motorcycle up them, but it's going to get us both killed.
[183:01.25]I was 90% of the way to the peak.
[183:06.99]I think we're supposed to go up there, aren't we?
[183:09.67]It's down.
[183:11.11]What does the quest text say?
[183:12.09]We're going to read quest text for the first time.
[183:17.96]Okay.
[183:20.02]You may have killed the raptors, but the silver they stole must be recovered.
[183:24.18]I have reports that raptors have a large grouping of nests south of Ratchet, known as the raptor grounds.
[183:29.97]It's likely that they brought our stolen silver there.
[183:33.41]Go to this raptor haven and search for the stolen silver.
[183:36.45]There's raptors, like, here.
[183:39.67]On my map, we are not even remotely in the right place.
[183:48.35]There are raptors here, though.
[183:50.34]There are.
[183:50.94]It's not super specific quest text, just like, go south.
[184:05.49]I think a lot of the kind of...
[184:08.61]turn against the mature animated cartoon thing.
[184:13.36]I think like in the era where Family Guy was considered at its like most popular in the earlier seasons, I think like it was still kind of like funny because it's, you're not supposed to do that on TV.
[184:26.86]And now it's just completely ubiquitous to the point where it's just inundated with like, I said, fuck,
[184:37.30]Do you remember when South Park- Oh look, someone's brain just exploded.
[184:40.47]Like I just shot someone and they're- look at the gibbets.
[184:45.25]Yeah, that has been just a lot.
[184:47.69]Because TVMA back then... That was a big deal.
[184:51.81]Remember South Park did the thing where they said shit 200 times on TV and it was... No one had ever heard of that before.
[184:59.61]That never happened.
[185:00.67]Oh yeah, like it was funnier when it was like... rare.
[185:04.15]When it was like uncommon.
[185:07.57]And we became like desensitized.
[185:10.19]And I think that was the point of the South Park episode.
[185:12.53]I think it's exactly what we're describing.
[185:21.61]Yeah, Trey Parker and Matt Stone have not missed a beat.
[185:24.07]I haven't seen any of the new South Parks, but all their other stuff was wonderful.
[185:30.41]Are we getting baited?
[185:31.25]Uh-oh.
[185:33.20]Careful.
[185:33.58]You trying to kill us?
[185:36.84]Or are you trying to run away?
[185:41.78]It's not always malicious, right?
[185:43.26]I don't know.
[185:45.00]This guy's been following for a while.
[185:46.96]Oh, is he trying to get us killed?
[185:50.59]Okay, yep.
[185:51.03]He's trying to get us killed.
[185:58.89]Just take your Voidwalker down.
[186:00.31]Yeah, it should be.
[186:01.45]Alright.
[186:07.47]Well, let's just go over here and get ourselves a little lair.
[186:13.45]Oh, true.
[186:13.95]Good idea.
[186:20.84]Just see him zooming by, sprinting by with five of them on him.
[186:36.88]Honestly, I would've just had the Voidwalker attack everything and I would've just... I would've just sacrificed and ran.
[186:48.91]Anybody got a lair?
[186:49.77]I guess I could do it in guild chat too, right?
[187:00.84]Yeah, I think guild chat should work.
[187:14.37]I'm not going to write.
[187:17.89]Got it.
[187:21.07]Thank you for the lair.
[187:25.43]I will invite you.
[187:26.33]What happened to my bar?
[187:45.59]I guess if we just didn't attack, we probably wouldn't have.
[187:48.59]That guy probably just got himself killed.
[187:53.71]But what if we do have it all wrong and that guy genuinely ran away and then grabbed a bunch of stuff and ran the other way?
[187:59.70]Now that would be both funny and sad.
[188:04.30]No offense to that guy, but if that's the case, then they're too recklessly stupid to be hanging around.
[188:13.63]This place is dangerous.
[188:15.98]I think the respawn rate is crazy here.
[188:17.53]We should be actually really careful.
[188:49.76]Yeah, I think there could be like five raptors around here at any given time.
[188:53.29]We should just kill all of them as they spawn.
[188:56.21]I think the silver is right over there though.
[189:00.77]Let's try to clear this quick.
[189:26.08]Okay, it should be right here somewhere.
[189:29.22]There it is.
[189:34.54]The Max?
[189:35.24]I actually have the Max on DVD.
[189:38.38]And it's sealed.
[189:39.68]It's not been opened.
[189:48.26]Did you grab it?
[189:54.46]It's in this box right here.
[189:56.87]Yeah, I got the box.
[189:57.97]Okay, cool.
[190:00.57]And then there was like a feather.
[190:01.61]Oh, it was just the silver.
[190:04.65]And then the, I don't think we need the feathers anymore.
[190:07.04]I actually got it from a comic con.
[190:23.04]There was a vendor there that was selling.
[190:24.38]I got the head and the max.
[190:32.03]Of what?
[190:32.39]Old Liquid Television MTV shows.
[190:46.42]They both sealed.
[190:47.98]And they're both in their original packaging.
[190:57.97]I don't have an original Aeon Flux.
[191:00.07]No, I do not.
[191:04.67]That show was crazy too.
[191:08.51]The whole Liquid Television lineup was... I just don't realize how a lot of awesome that a lot of stuff really... Beavis and Butthead came from that.
[191:25.37]You're talking about MTV shows I've never seen in my entire life.
[191:28.45]And it occurred to me, you're kind of giving me a taste of what it would be like to be in a call with like Northernlion.
[191:33.25]You know what I mean?
[191:36.51]And I would just be like smiling.
[191:38.05]Yeah, I love that actor.
[191:39.09]I love that actress.
[191:40.29]You didn't see Aeon Flux?
[191:41.63]You didn't see the original Aeon Flux show?
[191:44.82]I know of Aeon Flux.
[191:48.80]But I've never seen it all the way.
[191:50.82]I've never seen it.
[191:52.15]I'm also the kind of person who will admit when they haven't seen shit, because I'm a staunch believer in the fact that people should not be made fun of for what they have not experienced, so I'm trying to lead by example, you know?
[192:02.77]Like, too many people lie.
[192:04.21]They're just like, hey, you know who this is?
[192:06.71]Yeah, of course I do.
[192:08.53]And now you have to pretend.
[192:09.89]No, fuck that.
[192:10.61]Just be like, no, I don't know what you're talking about.
[192:15.92]The original Aeon Flux was...
[192:18.93]um what's the animation director oh my god I'm gonna be so Peter what's his name oh my god why can I think of his name I'm gonna go crazy no not Peter Griffin oh my god yeah the the famed animator Peter Griffin
[192:47.66]I went back in time and animated Aeon Flux.
[192:52.92]Peter Chung, there you go.
[192:53.86]Thank you, Peter Chung.
[192:56.62]Uh, it's such a surreal, just bizarre, all over the place show.
[193:02.84]There's almost no dialog.
[193:06.10]It's an action spy kind of... It's one of the most off-putting shows I've ever seen.
[193:20.26]Peter chung has an animatrix episode oh yeah Peter chung did the animatrix the whole thing right I completely forgot about that so if you like the animatrix
[193:45.50]No, it was an anthology, okay?
[193:46.68]But if you liked Peter Chung's episode, go watch all of the original Aeon Flux.
[193:52.74]Not the Charlize Theron remake.
[193:54.90]That was no- Oh my, don't even get me started on that.
[194:01.23]Go be a hipster, because being a hipster in this case really, really is worth it.
[194:06.21]And go watch the original.
[194:08.27]But yeah, I-
[194:09.85]I did really like the Animatrix and I remember, um, I think it was like 13 or 14 when it came out.
[194:16.35]And I remember watching it, not realizing kind of like what the content of it was going to be.
[194:21.98]And then being like, I better shut my door.
[194:24.06]So my mom doesn't see what's on the TV.
[194:25.88]Yeah.
[194:33.49]I remember Amflux was very, it was,
[194:38.06]It wasn't that violent.
[194:39.12]It was just very weird.
[194:42.00]There was a lot of violence in it, but I remember there was one in particular.
[194:44.46]There's one episode that stuck with me forever.
[194:47.15]And it's going to be a little spoilery, but no, no, fuck that.
[194:50.37]No, just go watch it.
[194:51.17]It's 16 episodes.
[194:53.93]Each episode is kind of a standalone weird story that kind of connects.
[195:04.12]Yeah, I'd probably like it.
[195:05.26]I mean, it's... That is a mature audience show, though, for sure.
[195:08.37]Sorry, what were you saying?
[195:15.09]I was saying, like, it's iconic.
[195:18.39]Like, its reputation precedes it.
[195:25.48]If you like just pieces of kind of art, because there's not a whole lot of dialog.
[195:29.62]It's the story is told by the scenery and by what's happening in the scenes.
[195:34.32]Anne Flux doesn't really talk at all.
[195:35.80]I think she says one or two words in the whole series.
[195:38.37]Or like a couple sentences, maybe each episode.
[195:50.65]Have you seen the original ghost in the show?
[195:56.82]long time ago when it was airing on toonami did they show like the full uncut oh wait wait did you watch the TV show or did you watch like the movie no there was the that aired on adult swim right because they had a standalone complex was on that they made they probably showed the movie too
[196:24.64]I remember there was a series.
[196:25.60]There was an episodic series that was on Adult Swim.
[196:29.34]Yeah, that's Stand Alone Complex, I think.
[196:33.39]And that's good too, but it's not the original movie.
[196:36.15]You got to watch like the OG movie.
[196:43.73]I'll check it out.
[196:45.83]I thought the series they showed on Adult Swim was good.
[196:51.21]What do you need?
[196:53.59]For the Horde?
[197:04.19]standalone complex is better people are saying that that's what people are saying I mean standalone complex has like multiple seasons like uh I was the original ghost in the shell is like as influential as like akira
[197:31.50]If I'm even... I just realized how do you pronounce that out loud?
[197:37.57]I think you said it right.
[197:38.87]Yeah, that was correct.
[197:46.30]That was right.
[198:05.16]It's been a long time since I've seen that.
[198:08.35]I only saw that movie once.
[198:09.63]I saw the movie one time and it was so crazy that I said, you know what?
[198:15.67]I don't think I need to see that one again.
[198:18.59]I took it in.
[198:22.53]Yeah.
[198:22.99]A lot of like amazing movies are like that though.
[198:26.41]Wait, where did you go?
[198:28.05]We have a turn in down here.
[198:30.03]Oh, I thought, I don't, where am I going?
[198:34.33]I'm halfway walk to Ratchet.
[198:36.13]It was a turn in... Yeah, I think it was confusing because we were at Ratchet and the quest said to go below Ratchet.
[198:41.74]It's one of those...
[198:52.46]watch it every five years to make sure that you keep up with it and it's something you remember but I feel like watching that movie too many times in a row you just it kind of loses the reason why it was so cool in the first place
[199:12.21]Yeah, and also, like some chatters have pointed out, it's funny to go back and watch some of these movies that pop culture has borrowed from so heavily that it's like, oh man, I can't believe they're doing this cliche.
[199:27.02]And it's like they started it.
[199:29.75]Yeah, you know where it came from?
[199:34.21]Well met.
[199:37.72]Alright, I think I'm getting really tired.
[199:41.34]I'm falling asleep here.
[199:43.66]Not because of WoW or anything we're doing.
[199:45.58]It just hit me like a ton of bricks like half an hour ago.
[199:51.75]I got two bars.
[199:54.49]You're almost 20.
[200:00.19]If we have a turn in there that I'm about to fly to, then... Yeah, there's a turn in here at Camp Droho.
[200:18.01]When I watched Scream for the first time, I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it because I thought it was just going to be a shlop due to Ghostface Halloween costume presence and the scary movie series.
[200:29.40]Yeah, it's going to be like dog shit.
[200:33.94]Yeah, it's a shitty horror movie.
[200:36.04]It's a piece of crap.
[200:44.28]What's that new horror movie out?
[200:46.18]The one where the guy like rips people apart and everyone like pukes in the theater.
[200:49.25]What is it called?
[200:50.17]Terrifier?
[200:52.73]Oh, I don't know.
[200:53.21]I haven't seen like an actual proper horror movie in the theaters in like five years.
[201:01.35]Yeah, Terrifier is the new... It's the crazy horror movie where you can't handle it.
[201:08.15]There were people that puked in the theater.
[201:11.23]And whenever I hear about that, I kind of go, well, I don't really want to go see that.
[201:15.98]That's a movie at home.
[201:16.94]Yeah, you want to make sure you can puke at home so you have access to your toilet.
[201:23.01]Can you imagine going to a movie like that, knowing that you're queasy and being like, I really hope I don't puke in the theater and being the person that pukes in the theater.
[201:31.82]Who wants to puke in a theater?
[201:36.56]Make sure you eat that popcorn fast and your popcorn bucket will double as a puke box.
[201:43.38]And by the way, can you imagine watching a movie with somebody?
[201:47.83]And the three or two of you or four of you are sitting on a couch and you're watching this horror movie and somebody gets up and goes and pukes in your bathroom toilet.
[202:02.65]And then comes back and sits down.
[202:04.41]Are we watching the movie still?
[202:07.63]Are we going to continue to watch it?
[202:09.33]It's better than somebody like puking in your trash can.
[202:11.79]Did anyone ever hand you like a small trash can when you were like a kid to puke in?
[202:15.46]It's like, who's going to clean this?
[202:18.35]Like at least a toilet can flush.
[202:21.88]If somebody's puking in my bathroom, whatever we're doing is ceasing.
[202:29.04]And that person is going to be treated and attended to.
[202:35.99]Because there is an option for that to happen again.
[202:38.71]You don't watch the opening cutscene of Terrifier, go puke in my bathroom.
[202:42.91]Come back and sit down and go, whoa.
[202:45.20]Alright, go ahead and hit play.
[202:47.86]No, dude.
[202:48.86]No, excuse me.
[202:49.60]You're banned from my house.
[202:52.30]We're not watching scary.
[202:53.52]You're banned from my house watching scary movies.
[202:59.39]Naja is banned in Jerma households.
[203:02.49]No, I mean like banned from watching horror movies in my house.
[203:08.07]Because you're the... I don't want you to puke again.
[203:10.72]No, let's like watch something else, but put on... Let's play Chutes and Ladders or something.
[203:15.80]Let's get out of Candyland.
[203:17.44]Let's get out Candyland?
[203:25.38]Yeah, and just play a board game or something.
[203:27.45]Is that what you think of first when you think of board games?
[203:36.42]let's play like the apples game yeah what I just said Etalyx just sent me to fucking board game hell for that one oh let's play like um avatar monopoly dude you don't want to yeah you don't want to play iPad monopoly go why not
[204:05.93]Oh, how about we just let's go over here and play war?
[204:10.30]We could just flip cards.
[204:14.14]For those of you that don't know, Etalyx has a shelf.
[204:18.76]And that shelf is multiple tiers.
[204:21.58]And each one is full.
[204:23.84]Of different versions of monopoly, we're talking the monopoly Jurassic Park, monopoly Game of Thrones.
[204:31.13]He loves it and he has all the versions of it.
[204:34.53]The one with the credit card.
[204:38.02]Star Wars.
[204:38.64]Oh, yeah.
[204:38.90]Yeah, I just got done playing Monopoly Office the other day.
[204:44.62]And, you know, in that one, instead of Park Place, it's Dunder Mifflin Headquarters.
[204:55.81]This person said, someone pukes at Jerma's house.
[205:01.29]Okay, time to play Risk, I guess, then.
[205:05.43]That's not even what I was saying.
[205:11.26]I'm just saying, if we're watching a horror movie and you puke from the horror movie, you are not coming over the house again if a horror movie is going to be on my TV.
[205:23.37]I'm doing it to protect you and my bathroom.
[205:27.37]Hey, bro, want to hang out on Friday?
[205:29.31]Oh, sorry, dude.
[205:30.11]I'm watching a horror movie and it looks like it won't line up.
[205:34.55]That's horror movie Friday and you're not invited.
[205:46.92]No, it's... He likes a clean bathroom more than he likes his friends.
[205:54.39]I'm telling you, my mother used to call... My mother calls me Monk.
[206:00.05]Alright, that's... I'm probably going to call it here.
[206:15.60]Oh, glad we can, like, finish off the World of Warcraft Saturday with some puke.
[206:21.62]Hope nobody in chat's feeling nauseous right now.
[206:35.62]Listen, I know some of you see World of Warcraft come up and you're like, bleh.
[206:40.16]If you puke from Terrifier and I tell you that, hey, I'm watching Terrifier 2 today and you're over, we're giving you a VR headset to do something else.
[206:56.15]Hang on.
[206:56.63]No, no, no, no.
[206:57.41]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[206:58.69]The person who just puked from the horror movie, you're going to throw them into virtual reality.
[207:04.14]That's like a torture chair.
[207:05.82]Not on the same day.
[207:07.22]That's going to like double down.
[207:14.56]no you don't it's not like oh my god he just ripped that lady's head off oh he's like drinking the blood out of her head oh my god this person just puked get get him in the VR headset and put him on a roller coaster game no I'm talking about like days later weeks later it's like so delayed though like you're watching a horror movie instead of just watching like a different movie next time they come over
[207:45.14]you're like no you're going in the VR roller coaster three weeks after you puked yeah you're going you're going into the movie timeout that goes on your permanent record like the like a scarlet letter dude I promise I'm not gonna puke hey you said you were making nachos with extra cheese and stuff right oh dude I'm there
[208:26.23]Yeah, that person's going to puke in the nachos.
[208:29.03]Listen, I'm being... What you guys don't know is he's subtweeting me right now because I puked once in the old house.
[208:36.08]He won't let me live it down.
[208:47.05]Oh, that's funny.
[208:47.63]Alright, dude.
[208:50.94]Uh, you got to 20.
[208:51.66]I'm almost 20.
[208:52.96]That means we're pretty close to Wailing Caverns, which means we could probably do it the next time we play it.
[208:59.82]I don't know what my skills are.
[209:01.88]Tomorrow, I might be live.
[209:04.21]I don't know if I'm going to play WoW tomorrow, but I want to do like a meaty session of WoW.
[209:11.27]Maybe early this coming week, we can do Wailing Caverns.
[209:15.34]sounds good I'm uh if I'm two bars away then you're probably like 60 or something yeah I'm close I'm like 50 60 65 or so and then I think 20 is like a good threshold just to do whaling caverns if we have Holly healing you'll be fine
[209:42.19]yeah as long as I don't get squished by the final boss right Holly is a giga a giga wow veteran so you are not dying in whaling caverns if she's there oh yeah sounds good alright dude thanks for playing thanks for hanging out good time as always and uh have fun
[210:13.02]follow like I got so distracted walking and talking because I cannot like I can't I pace on the phone.
[210:20.72]I just walked to ratchet five minutes ago.
[210:23.29]You know what I mean?
[210:23.73]Like I thought we were just walking to ratchet.
[210:25.89]That's the wow way.
[210:28.11]You just aimlessly go in a direction or aimlessly jump around in a circle.
[210:34.89]I feel like that's the most pure MMO-ism is people in a Discord call just jumping in circles while either talking or waiting for their friends.
[210:47.56]Yeah.
[210:49.78]I don't even want to know how many times I have jumped in the air like that.
[210:54.73]If there was a counter, it has to be into the tens, if not hundreds of thousands over 20 years.
[210:59.49]And you pay $15 a month to do that.
[211:10.71]That's true.
[211:15.90]Alright, dude.
[211:16.36]I'll talk to you soon.
[211:18.50]Gamers, good night, JermaChat.
[211:21.52]And thanks for having me as always.
[211:25.12]Don't puke or you're banned.
[211:27.24]Yeah, don't puke or you get banned.
[211:28.57]Alright, see you later, dude.
[211:32.11]Bye.
[211:35.09]I cut off his bye accidentally.
[211:39.14]Oh, I am tired.
[211:40.22]Sorry, guys.
[211:40.94]I'm just... I had a lot more energy last night around this time.
[211:44.04]Not tonight.
[211:46.28]I'm just, uh... I'm an energy shell.
[211:53.48]Uh, I might stream tomorrow, maybe.
[211:57.59]Definitely on Monday.
[212:01.97]I've been having fun, though.
[212:02.67]I really have been just... just going.
[212:14.82]What time is it right now?
[212:19.86]It's 1015?
[212:22.38]Already?
[212:22.78]Oh yeah, it's 1am for a lot of you.
[212:40.89]Or later.
[212:52.00]Time flies while you're aimlessly wandering.
[212:54.62]Yeah, that's the World of Warcraft curse.
[212:58.23]Ten minutes in-game in WoW is one hour in real-time.
[213:05.73]It's a time warp when you jump in this game, it really is.
[213:14.53]But yeah, maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow night.
[213:17.63]Maybe we'll start Dracula, pick something else.
[213:21.72]I do like Monster Hunter.
[213:23.00]It's just the multiplayer was just miserable.
[213:28.72]So maybe I'll play Monster Hunter just solo.
[213:32.39]I don't know.
[213:42.85]Ster played alone with it.
[213:43.73]Yeah, I saw him doing that.
[213:46.67]It seemed like he was having a good time.
[213:57.50]Yeah, GG.
[214:00.22]Almost level 20.
[214:00.98]That's one step closer to level 40.
[214:02.70]And that's one step closer to dying by a quill boar while you're eating a cheesesteak.
[214:16.81]Have a good night.
[214:18.55]See you guys soon.
[214:19.45]Call your mother.
[214:22.07]And that's it.
[214:24.31]Tata, take care.
[214:26.06]See you later.
[214:29.57]Thank you.
