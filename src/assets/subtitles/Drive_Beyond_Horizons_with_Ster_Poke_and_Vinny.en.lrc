[00:05.10]Okay, the next one we're playing is, what, Horizon?
[00:07.95]Drive Beyond Horizons.
[00:10.91]I'm going to turn my volume down because it's probably going to be awful.
[00:20.84]I have to buy it and install it.
[00:24.89]Alright, wait, I'm sending it to you.
[00:28.31]Do you have one?
[00:29.43]Do you have a key?
[00:31.05]Are you making jokes?
[00:33.27]No, I just... I just care about you, so... You're gonna Uber Eats me one?
[00:43.92]I Uber Eats you one right now.
[00:47.24]Did you get it?
[00:47.68]Is that your door?
[00:50.46]Yeah, it's installing.
[00:54.43]Ster, how did you not have either of the games that we were gonna play today ready to go before?
[01:00.92]Deadlock.
[01:02.12]Deadlock.
[01:03.12]Deadlock.
[01:03.78]That's fair.
[01:04.30]Deadlock.
[01:04.58]Poke, did you have them ready?
[01:06.81]Uh, honestly, yeah.
[01:10.43]I'm sorry, man.
[01:10.97]You did.
[01:12.01]I usually do.
[01:12.79]I'm usually prepared, but, like, this is your brain on Deadlock, and it's the fried egg.
[01:23.47]And I'm done.
[01:24.01]My brain is gone tomorrow.
[01:25.31]PoE 2, man.
[01:27.27]Dude, I'm actually really excited.
[01:28.54]No cap.
[01:29.12]PoE 2?
[01:29.86]Oh, PoE.
[01:30.52]Yeah.
[01:31.17]I thought there was a game called PeeWee.
[01:33.84]Am I at 100%?
[01:35.34]PeeWee, dude they cooked so hard with the update.
[01:39.91]It looks really fucking good.
[01:43.39]What the hell is going on?
[01:47.42]What?
[01:48.72]Is that a meme?
[01:59.44]My audio's being weird with this game.
[02:05.97]Dude, Vinny.
[02:08.33]I have a clip.
[02:09.21]I linked it in Discord.
[02:11.53]You got a clip?
[02:13.31]The window.
[02:14.00]That was funny as shit.
[02:15.92]Oh, the window was amazing.
[02:18.08]Dude, the spider came in, you got killed, and then it started carrying you away.
[02:22.83]I come with items.
[02:25.71]That's a funny clip.
[02:28.39]It's good.
[02:30.37]Alright, are we ready to get this going?
[02:34.84]Yeah, I'm downloading it.
[02:39.78]Got a cool beat.
[02:45.89]What the hell did I just do?
[02:46.85]Who am I streaming together with?
[02:49.58]Did I just click a random person?
[02:52.64]Scenario or no limit?
[02:54.00]What do we do?
[02:57.45]Uh...
[03:08.49]Hey, what does that mean?
[03:09.99]Attempt scenario or something.
[03:12.62]Why is this not coming through my... Wait a minute.
[03:19.17]Wait.
[03:19.99]Why is this wait like that?
[03:21.07]Why is it like this?
[03:22.71]Wait a minute.
[03:23.49]Stop.
[03:23.87]You're messing with me.
[03:25.28]Wait.
[03:26.84]Hold on.
[03:27.40]Why is it... Stop.
[03:31.40]Guys, can I play with you all?
[03:34.83]Yeah, sure.
[03:35.91]Is it the hacker?
[03:38.11]What's up?
[03:40.72]Okay, I got a game up, I think.
[03:43.43]And, uh, I got the password in the chat there.
[03:47.21]You can just join off me in a moment.
[03:48.95]I got a multiplayer scenario.
[03:51.50]Ooh.
[03:54.30]Oh, you know, this could be good.
[04:00.57]I bought it, and I downloaded it, and it says I don't have DirectX, so I can't play.
[04:06.42]Go get it!
[04:07.86]Oh my god, dude!
[04:09.06]What the fuck?!
[04:09.98]!
[04:10.76]It's loud, isn't it?
[04:12.42]Why did that just happen?
[04:13.91]What?
[04:17.39]That was fucking awful when you load the game up into the server.
[04:21.24]Did any of you do it yet?
[04:23.05]I don't know what happened.
[04:26.05]That's the exact same sound from Devil May Cry.
[04:28.23]What happened?
[04:31.72]He sounded exactly the same.
[04:33.78]No, dude, it was fucking awful.
[04:37.00]I'm gonna compare those clips.
[04:37.84]That was crazy.
[04:39.92]What the fuck was that?
[04:41.13]No, seriously.
[04:42.71]Is it when you joined a game?
[04:46.75]When you join his game, turn your fucking volume down.
[04:51.08]What the hell, man?
[04:53.64]What just happened?
[04:54.60]What is it?
[04:54.88]It doesn't happen when I do it.
[04:56.07]Well, because I created it.
[04:59.26]I thought I got shot in the head.
[05:00.50]I feel like I just died.
[05:07.43]Oh my god, was that bad?
[05:08.57]Everyone who plays this game hears that sound!

[05:39.06]I'm so fucking scared.
[05:42.25]That was... Fuck, what are you doing?
[05:44.53]You're peeing on me.
[05:47.90]What do you mean?
[05:48.80]Why are we on the same guy?
[05:53.50]I'm in tears right now.
[05:55.25]That was stupid.
[05:55.65]It's one of these games.
[05:56.85]Alright, it's one of these games.
[05:58.21]It's one of these middle finger games.
[06:00.43]My game did not make a loud noise.
[06:03.09]It didn't?
[06:04.20]Really?
[06:05.18]No, I lowered my volume.
[06:06.76]Nothing happened.
[06:08.14]Please chat, link me.
[06:09.46]Me and Poke had the explosion.
[06:10.93]Poke, you really had the explosion?
[06:12.85]Yes!
[06:13.67]Okay.
[06:14.61]I was like... Yeah!
[06:23.94]Was it a really loud metal noise?
[06:26.50]Yeah.
[06:28.64]It was like half a second.
[06:30.33]Half a second mid-explosion.
[06:32.11]It's like four-dimensional.
[06:40.12]It's so loud.
[06:42.32]What the fuck?
[06:43.86]I hate computers.
[06:45.53]My volume is at 25%.
[06:47.23]Watching your clip, I want to see yours.
[06:48.67]Dude, thank God that I have implemented measures.
[06:53.97]I had, everything was, I have a mitigator now.
[06:58.27]Mine was louder.
[06:59.80]Mine was louder.
[07:01.00]Yours was louder.
[07:01.86]I swear to God, mine was, yours sounded like a metal shovel.
[07:08.14]I want to hear pokes too.
[07:13.25]I'm not clicking either of these.
[07:14.55]I'm too traumatized.
[07:15.89]Am I talking in game?
[07:18.63]No.
[07:26.14]Mine's way louder than yours.
[07:27.91]Yours is worse.
[07:28.97]I don't know.
[07:29.35]I'm so scared to click it.
[07:31.45]I'm going to click it, but I'm going to do very low.
[07:38.59]Did you think you got killed too?
[07:53.18]I thought I got killed in my room.
[07:54.62]I was like somebody shot me.
[07:55.50]I'm dead.
[07:56.08]It was when you loaded the game like first time.
[08:01.17]So I was like, I didn't expect it to happen when I loaded in the server.
[08:03.73]I know, right?
[08:05.13]Fuck.
[08:05.93]This game is $30, by the way.
[08:07.95]Why did that get us both?
[08:09.86]25 bucks.
[08:15.44]Okay.
[08:16.02]You're so lucky.
[08:19.63]You're drinking the piss out of his penis?
[08:21.71]What's going on?
[08:27.06]Fuck.
[08:30.20]Holy shit, dude, that is actually a gunshot to the side of your head What are these pictures on the shelf here Like who is this guy we did am I like clipping to the ground I
[08:57.58]That is so funny that every person who plays this game hears this noise.
[09:01.99]They have no choice.
[09:02.99]Apparently not you, which is crazy.
[09:04.90]I put my volume real low.
[09:06.74]I might have just missed it.
[09:09.51]I was very nervous about it.
[09:14.76]Oh, man.
[09:15.38]Okay.
[09:18.66]It makes funny iPad game sounds when you do that.
[09:27.07]Okay, so this is, um... Dude... The fuckface game.
[09:34.01]This is a fuckface game, it is.
[09:36.08]It's so... It's true.
[09:37.40]It's very fuckface-y.
[09:40.02]Oh, man.
[09:40.50]Alright, um... Are there any tools we should be getting?
[09:43.03]Like, I grabbed a backpack.
[09:45.71]This is The Long Drive 2.
[09:47.41]People are saying that Poke Yours is way worse.
[09:49.46]Like, I must have had mine lower.
[09:51.20]It was... I... I listen to Pokes at max volume...
[09:56.21]It was not good.
[09:57.17]I feel so sorry for you that it was that much louder because the one that happened to me, I felt like it was awful.
[10:02.32]It's your fault.
[10:05.38]Can I just bring this energy here that's going to happen?
[10:10.23]We just move on.
[10:10.99]Okay.
[10:11.87]It never happened.
[10:12.87]Okay.
[10:13.91]Alright.
[10:14.13]We're good with no loud sounds.
[10:15.81]We're good.
[10:19.56]Who is doing?
[10:20.24]Is somebody talking?
[10:20.94]What is going on?
[10:23.97]It's just a radio I found that speaks French.
[10:29.07]Our objective is grab the rocket launcher.
[10:33.68]Where is it?
[10:38.84]I don't know.
[10:39.12]Get that car started!
[10:44.25]I turned this game's volume up and I don't know if I should have.
[10:48.07]You should, honestly.
[10:51.66]Ew, look at that lime green!
[10:54.34]Was I supposed to detach this?
[10:55.78]Do we need this?
[10:56.79]How did you pee?
[10:59.55]Our car is very, like, dirty.
[11:02.82]Wait, how do you even attach things?
[11:05.94]What is this?
[11:06.88]I attached a thing by accident.
[11:08.08]Did you see me hovering with this thing?
[11:09.81]The radiator?
[11:10.37]What is this?
[11:11.49]Yeah, I took it out of the car.
[11:13.45]Graphics are either so good or so shit at times.
[11:17.12]Alright, radiator is in.
[11:19.86]Hold on, Leezy.
[11:21.50]Oh, listen to that.
[11:27.03]Oh, nice blue.
[11:28.87]That's blue, right?
[11:30.58]Purple?
[11:31.86]I can't tell.
[11:32.28]I think it's purple.
[11:35.10]Hey, we gotta fill it up with gas!
[11:36.69]I guess we don't need the radiator.
[11:48.97]READ THE F- Come outside here!
[11:50.39]Look what happened!
[11:51.99]WHAT?!
[11:52.27]!
[11:54.38]I went to go read that fucking early access sign and they put a bomb there!
[11:58.83]What?
[11:59.29]What do you mean?
[12:00.33]What the fuck?
[12:01.43]What the fuck?
[12:02.85]And now it's not there for you?
[12:04.01]Okay.
[12:05.66]Okay.
[12:07.08]What the fuck?
[12:08.76]Some features may explode at any moment.
[12:11.56]I'm not moving.
[12:13.55]I'm not moving anymore.
[12:14.29]Every explosion is a step towards a more stable game in theory.
[12:16.59]Thank you for your patience and have fun despite the little bumps.
[12:21.28]I mean, the ga- I mean, let's- let's just take a look.
[12:23.33]That's a fuckface, like, x10 maneuver.
[12:26.27]Objectively, this is a beautiful horizon here.
[12:29.67]This is gorgeous.
[12:30.29]This is beautiful.
[12:30.82]I don't know what engine this is, but this is great looking.
[12:32.54]Are you guys on max graphics?
[12:33.52]I'm on max.
[12:34.02]I think this is on Unreal Engine.
[12:35.24]This is Unreal.
[12:36.30]Yeah.
[12:37.70]But, okay.
[12:39.09]No, it's real.
[12:40.13]This is happening.
[12:41.43]Goodness gracious.
[12:42.53]Honest to goodness.
[12:43.43]We should drive.
[12:45.25]Honest to goodness.
[12:46.74]Who's gonna drive?
[12:48.14]Me.
[12:48.62]Me.
[12:51.03]No.
[12:51.55]Ah, Vinny.
[12:53.86]You see what I could... You can adjust the steering wheel.
[12:57.52]Guys, does this look normal?
[12:58.72]Do I look normal?
[13:00.22]No.
[13:01.00]Not at all.
[13:01.44]Wait, wait, wait.
[13:02.44]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13:04.51]Hulk, can you turn your head to the left?
[13:09.75]Wait, left or right?
[13:10.61]Left.
[13:10.97]No, no, no.
[13:15.87]How do I do anything?
[13:17.88]Alright, Hulk, look up.
[13:19.56]Look up.
[13:22.81]Can someone else drive for a minute?
[13:24.51]This is some fucked up shit.
[13:26.77]Am I the only one seeing this?
[13:28.76]What are you talking about?
[13:30.22]You look like a giant outside of this car.
[13:32.70]Stern, can you drive real quick?
[13:35.27]You look like a troll looking into a cave.
[13:37.47]This is fucked up.
[13:44.58]Just one second, one second before you leave.
[13:46.31]Hang on, I'm just adjusting your seat for you.
[13:49.19]Thank you.
[13:49.86]Yeah, cool.
[13:50.82]Alright, now you're good.
[13:51.46]Alright, everybody get in!
[13:52.18]Let's go!
[13:52.73]Puck, lift your head up.
[13:53.81]Alright, I'm ready.
[13:55.33]Where?
[13:56.05]Like, just straight ahead, lift it up?
[13:58.24]I don't know how.
[13:59.44]Like, look up towards the ceiling.
[14:03.69]Okay.
[14:05.67]Use the mouse wheel.
[14:08.18]Use the mouse wheel to adjust your seat.
[14:16.10]This is not right.
[14:17.72]Are we all in?
[14:18.84]Yeah, we're in.
[14:19.84]Let me get out.
[14:23.61]Wait, what the hell?
[14:25.39]Who's out here?
[14:28.89]I think that's Vinny.
[14:30.17]Poke, your head was underneath the seat between my legs that whole time.
[14:35.70]I didn't realize I was driving behind me.
[14:40.62]Wait, I can adjust your seats.
[14:41.81]Guys, yeah, use the mouse wheel to adjust your seats.
[14:44.45]It's really good.
[14:48.37]Hold on, I need to make this game 30 times louder.
[14:53.67]Oh shit!
[14:54.95]My engine!
[14:56.51]My engine!
[14:57.10]How do I get out of the car?
[14:59.38]Okay.
[15:00.60]Rocket launchers are above exit door and inside of building.
[15:04.66]We gotta go back.
[15:06.35]What?
[15:07.23]We gotta go back for the rocket launcher.
[15:08.51]I don't think I have an engine.
[15:12.69]What if we find a new one?
[15:13.45]Do we need a rocket launcher?
[15:15.48]What about now?
[15:20.01]I think I pulled the engine out.
[15:22.67]Alright, we're going.
[15:24.99]Alright, running back home.
[15:25.67]Where is it?
[15:27.57]Above the garage, apparently.
[15:30.18]Where's the engine?
[15:32.38]It's in there.
[15:33.16]I don't... The battery's in here.
[15:36.03]There's no engine.
[15:39.33]Is that inappropriate?
[15:40.01]I don't know what I just did.
[15:42.39]Yes.
[15:46.80]Well, GG, I guess.
[15:49.66]Well, we got to walk, get a new car.
[15:53.50]The long walk?
[15:54.78]But where did it go, though, Jerma, the engine?
[15:57.29]It might be, I don't know.
[15:59.83]I pulled the thing off while we were on the road.
[16:03.23]I'm on the roof, I'm on the roof.
[16:07.22]I don't see a rocket launcher.
[16:10.04]Inside, above the door.
[16:11.47]Oh, there are.
[16:17.89]Do we have inventory?
[16:19.19]Oh, there's a bunch of rocket launchers.
[16:24.99]Wait, I know what the problem is.
[16:28.34]What the fuck was that?
[16:31.78]Hey!
[16:32.56]You little shit!
[16:36.73]Fuck you!
[16:39.03]Oh!
[16:42.81]Why do we have this?
[16:46.95]Yeah, watch this rocket jump, ready?
[16:53.44]What?
[16:53.56]Did you guys just die?
[16:54.18]No, I seem to be alright.
[16:59.91]Alright, we need, uh, we need a new car.
[17:06.90]Jesus God!
[17:09.39]What the fuck was that?
[17:10.03]I'm so glad it's low.
[17:13.71]Dude, I have the game turned on so low for everybody.
[17:16.15]And you, trust me, you should be happy about it.
[17:20.34]Dude, where?
[17:21.22]Why?
[17:22.04]Why?
[17:22.54]I died and pissed myself.
[17:26.15]Do a restart.
[17:26.91]Press P when you die.
[17:27.69]Yeah, how do we restart?
[17:36.30]Our car's dead.
[17:37.14]We're dead.
[17:38.12]Jump on the rocket.
[17:38.82]Ready?
[17:41.23]Like Fortnite.

[18:45.12]I need a battery resuscitation.
[18:49.63]What?
[18:51.83]Alright, restart this shit.

[19:01.14]I don't know how to restart.
[19:03.88]Okay, you need to put me down.

[19:09.91]Guys, I'm stuck in the settings.
[19:11.51]I can't get out.
[19:14.70]I have to restart.
[19:16.64]This game was $100.
[19:17.94]Now I'm stuck.
[19:21.29]I can't get out of the settings.
[19:25.06]Stop drinking piss.
[19:27.76]I can't stop pissing.
[19:29.01]I don't want to go back to the main menu and make a loud noise.
[19:31.42]I can't stop pissing.
[19:33.56]It's infinite.
[19:36.32]I'm dead.
[19:37.06]I'm dead.
[19:39.67]Oh, my God.
[19:40.37]I'm going to take my headphones off.

[20:11.13]Okay.
[20:11.43]Okay.
[20:12.21]I'm, I'm trying.
[20:13.13]Yo, make sure your game's at a hundred before you join.
[20:18.09]My headphones are coming out and I'm putting the shit at 5%.
[20:20.32]Alright.
[20:22.92]I'm on maximum.
[20:23.70]Now that's for you guys.
[20:27.98]You made one.
[20:28.56]Alright.
[20:32.63]I ain't doing that.
[20:35.78]Oh my god.
[20:36.48]Oh god, here we go.
[20:37.16]Oh, I hear it!
[20:39.20]My volume's low.
[20:40.84]Wait!
[20:41.60]My volume's low too, but I'm taking my headphones out.
[20:43.30]Would you name the server?
[20:44.16]What's the server?
[20:45.39]That's half off!
[20:47.55]Can't you just join?
[20:49.57]Off me on Steam?
[20:51.99]I'm old-fashioned.
[20:54.17]I don't think I put in a name.
[20:56.72]Okay.
[20:56.98]Oh god.
[20:59.20]I'm scared!
[21:00.52]I am terrified right now.

[21:06.88]Chat, prepare your ears.
[21:10.85]I'm in.
[21:12.05]Wait, why am I in the middle of nowhere?
[21:15.51]Oh, I think we're okay.
[21:18.48]Are we good?
[21:21.40]Was it just my server?
[21:22.72]Are you next to me?
[21:25.89]Yep, that's you, right?
[21:27.35]Why are we here?
[21:30.30]Why are you floating?
[21:32.35]I heard it, but it was really low.
[21:36.20]You're going crazy on my screen.
[21:38.54]Oh my god.
[21:41.18]How is this game fucked like this?
[21:43.97]It's $30!
[21:44.97]Poke, poke, come here, come here.
[21:47.07]Poke.
[21:47.27]Roblox works better- Wait.
[21:48.71]Come here.
[21:49.01]I see you guys on the map.
[21:51.19]Let's go drive to them.
[21:52.23]Turn around.
[21:53.24]Now go backwards all the way after you turn around and face me.
[21:56.94]Stop pissing!
[21:58.86]Oh.
[21:59.98]And now you have to- I gotta fight you like this.
[22:01.70]Wait, what?
[22:02.82]What are you talking about?
[22:06.35]Yeah, turn around and move your mouse all the way up and go upside down.
[22:12.30]Like this.
[22:13.28]I can only look up that much.
[22:15.78]Am I doing something weird?
[22:17.88]Yeah, you're bending.
[22:20.93]There's two of you flickering.
[22:22.93]I see two of you.
[22:24.15]You're going crazy.
[22:25.06]Okay, you're good now.
[22:28.20]Yeah, we need to get picked up.
[22:34.45]I don't know how you're doing that.
[22:37.62]Oh, you're in melee mode.
[22:42.68]Okay, I got it.
[22:43.84]I got to back up.
[22:47.95]Apparently you just go into piss mode.
[22:49.27]It's one button to piss forever.
[22:51.55]Let's go again.
[22:52.35]Wait, wait, wait.
[22:54.84]Piss on yourself when you're doing it.
[22:56.26]Oh, fuck.
[22:57.06]I don't know what I just did.
[22:58.48]I just changed all my settings on my computer.
[23:01.30]Oh my god, I changed every setting on my computer.
[23:05.47]I don't know what I just did.
[23:08.67]I need to extend my monitor.
[23:09.96]Oh, fuck.
[23:10.58]Okay, if you hold CTRL and P, you change all your windows.
[23:15.83]CTRL P?
[23:16.89]If you hold CTRL and P, you'll freak out.
[23:20.75]How are you holding CTRL?
[23:22.14]Oh, fuck.
[23:25.94]Hold on.
[23:28.28]Give me one second, sir.
[23:29.41]I'll be right with you.
[23:30.49]There's a backpack in here last time.
[23:32.93]It's just so hard to move.
[23:34.75]All my windows are minimized.
[23:36.36]Dude, that was fucked up.
[23:39.20]I was holding control to be in melee mode.
[23:41.62]No, I was holding crouch.
[23:43.14]And holding crouch, I hit the P button to pee on you.
[23:46.03]And then I stopped extending my monitors and my fucking screen fucked up.
[23:51.84]Oh, God.
[23:52.48]This is bad.
[23:54.20]Wait, don't put the chair in the car.
[23:57.82]Someone said I look like Voldo.
[24:01.22]Yeah.
[24:03.30]Wait, how do we actually bring the rocket launcher into the car?
[24:07.61]Alright.
[24:07.79]Where are we, folk?
[24:09.35]I think we have to, like, put it in the run.
[24:16.34]There needs to be a cape on you.
[24:18.37]You need to have a cape?
[24:21.73]You're like, okay, you're like when they put... I'm looking at your screen, you look like an admin or something.
[24:26.19]It looks like when they put like a superhero in Mortal Kombat, and they can't really fly, but they kind of make them hover a little.
[24:35.65]That you've been put in a different universe and they've nerfed you, you're able to float around.
[24:40.50]Oh god.
[24:44.36]Stop adjusting my steering wheel.
[24:47.11]I'm a fucking Gmod admin.
[24:49.64]I can't see the handbrake.
[24:52.92]Okay.
[24:58.29]Oh, well, we can see them.

[27:37.08]Vinny, you do it.
[27:37.92]Okay, I can do it.
[27:39.44]Yeah, we can all do it.
[27:44.68]I can't see!

[27:57.40]Can you see anything to the right?
[27:58.76]Yeah, should we go there?
[28:01.72]Should I wait until something's in front of us?
[28:02.82]Like... I have momentum right now.
[28:06.79]It's up to you.
[28:07.35]You're in the driver's seat.
[28:08.93]Dude, if I could R1, R1, R1 the back of your head, I would do it right now.
[28:12.27]Alright, next one, next one.
[28:21.34]This is nice.
[28:22.32]You could just still pee.
[28:23.80]It's funny because, yeah, The Long Drive is, like, crusty.
[28:27.75]Visually.
[28:29.15]But mechanically, very interesting.
[28:31.09]And this is, like, almost the exact opposite.
[28:34.48]Well, it's also crusty mechanically, too.
[28:36.34]The attaching system seems like it was cool.
[28:38.85]You could just put shit anywhere in long drive.
[28:40.83]I like that.
[28:41.81]Oh, that's not good.
[28:44.20]Speaking of... What's that noise?
[28:45.60]That's the front of the car.
[28:47.68]What the hell's leaking?

[28:52.61]Oh, okay.
[28:53.19]Oops.
[28:53.51]Jerma fell out.
[28:56.32]I think Vinny keeps taking the engine out.
[28:58.92]I can't even stop anymore.
[29:00.16]Yeah.
[29:04.19]Oh, no.
[29:05.57]Oh, here's my new voice.

[34:53.58]No, put your lows to the maximum.
[34:55.75]Raise your lows to the maximum.
[34:58.21]I thought you said lower my lows.
[34:59.29]No, I said raise the lows.
[35:01.19]Okay, and my highs are also raised.
[35:03.40]How do I get out of the car?
[35:04.84]Now you gotta raise your highs.
[35:07.50]Now you gotta lower the medium.
[35:10.71]Lower the medium.
[35:11.65]Lower the mediums.
[35:14.49]And now, talk.
[35:17.12]How do I get out of this?
[35:19.56]You have to unbuckle your seatbelt and then raise your nose to the next level.
[35:24.94]I am currently stuck in a car with four other content creators.
[35:28.57]That is royalty DMCA music, and that will get the claim of the stream.
[35:33.61]Can me and three other content creators get out of a car?
[35:37.74]Let's see what is going on.
[35:39.74]Welcome to the cock.
[35:43.21]Get me the fuck out of this car!
[35:51.06]Welcome, everybody, to the game.
[35:53.26]We are... Oops.
[35:56.00]Oh, shit.
[35:56.68]Looks like we've crashed into a pole here.
[35:58.93]We're going to have a little bit of traffic on the 108.5 highway.
[36:02.21]I'll do it, too.
[36:03.79]Going south, if you're going to want to reroute down to the tunnel.
[36:06.80]I know a lot of people don't like taking the tunnel, but... Vinesauce coming in from the back.
[36:11.20]You said it's highs all the way up?
[36:12.96]Yeah.
[36:13.11]yeah your eyes all the way up and your lows all the way up yourself in the game so you can hear it twice so you can take up as much volume as possible what is going on you all can hear me how are we doing ladies and gentlemen welcome to the new episode of no not good no it's not working hey everyone welcome to 10 46 in the evening the explosion
[36:42.25]My lows are as high as they can get.

[36:53.18]I'm just saying.
[36:56.25]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another episode of the long brand team.
[37:01.01]We've got four horsemen.
[37:06.66]Maybe we can close this game relatively soon so that I can get a full refund.
[37:12.29]yeah I'm actually having a good time with this game I think both of you are way out of line on that one maybe we should just walk we don't have oh should I can't turn my highs down now it's off the screen
[37:26.52]Can we get our wheels back?
[37:28.46]Oh, I blew them up.
[37:29.34]Never mind.
[37:30.56]I've got a problem, and if I change my profile, it doesn't change my equalizer.
[37:37.85]Are you stuck?
[37:39.74]Are you stuck like this?
[37:40.86]I think that I'm going to be like this for a long time.
[37:46.11]I turned off my equalizer.
[37:50.19]This has been such a fuckface stream.
[37:51.93]I love it, though.
[37:55.41]You're gonna put fucking hands up and not go?
[37:56.87]You're gonna put hands up?
[37:57.99]His last order was, come.
[38:01.21]And they came, all of them, even the dragons.
[38:05.38]I guess this profile has that sound on it.
[38:07.76]You sound like you got a new microphone out of the box, plugged it in, didn't even... What?
[38:16.12]What was that?
[38:16.92]Oh, I'm so sorry, that was my shit.
[38:19.62]Oh, he's so sorry.
[38:21.73]That was my therapist.
[38:25.09]Please, give me a line from your favorite poem.
[38:29.52]Please, please tell me it's Robert Frost.
[38:34.11]I don't know any literature.
[38:35.49]We here at the radio station do not read.
[38:43.99]You know, my mom says I got a face for radio.
[38:47.14]Where am I?
[38:51.28]Hello.
[38:51.87]I'm going to hit you with the southpaw.
[38:57.90]Oh, we could do like a boxing thing between the four horsemen.
[39:01.76]I don't know how to fix my voice, though.
[39:04.62]It actually stuck.
[39:07.61]It appears that I have some mic profiles and I may have saved over my default one.
[39:12.09]No!
[39:14.25]Let's all pee onto this at the same time.
[39:19.44]The pee is not coming from a front for me anymore.
[39:21.72]Yeah, why don't I have to pee anymore?
[39:23.16]Yeah, that is what I've done here.
[39:24.72]It is unfortunate.
[39:29.79]Uh-oh.
[39:32.00]Alright, well, let's walk.
[39:35.54]Alright.
[39:36.02]Come on.
[39:37.19]You can't just restart and spawn the car back?
[39:39.55]Any admins?
[39:40.93]Is there a way to restart?
[39:44.28]I see something over there.
[39:46.32]Hello?
[39:46.84]Oh, I got it.
[39:48.18]Nice.
[39:49.80]You're good now.
[39:52.09]Figured it out.
[39:52.53]I think I found a bathroom.
[39:57.97]The world is my bathroom.
[39:59.56]Okay, guys, we have...
[40:01.45]Okay, guys.
[40:04.43]Okay.
[40:07.47]You fixed it.
[40:08.07]You sound normal.
[40:08.69]You sound normal.
[40:09.16]Yeah.
[40:10.20]You do.
[40:12.16]Wait, we're running?
[40:14.54]Yeah.
[40:15.56]I'm not really sure what's happening.
[40:16.42]I don't see anything.
[40:16.96]Are we running?
[40:17.45]Which way are we running?
[40:19.05]We're going on north.
[40:25.02]Oh, whoa.
[40:27.50]Notice that I'm going to go watch the peak VOD instead.
[40:29.96]No, you stay here.
[40:32.77]This is the peak, Vaude.
[40:36.15]This is peak.
[40:38.71]This game sucks.
[40:44.98]I can't... Who is doing that?
[40:48.09]Oh, don't anybody ever give the aux to whoever that is.
[41:00.26]How does this game have such nice graphics?
[41:01.80]It pisses me off.
[41:03.28]Yeah, I know.
[41:04.20]It's, like, shocking.
[41:05.24]Okay, I will say, the game does run.
[41:09.62]Okay, but most of these Unity games like this, they kind of run at, like, 37 frames a second.
[41:14.19]This is, like, running at 100.
[41:15.39]This is, like, perfect.
[41:19.14]How much did they pay you?
[41:21.48]None.
[41:25.23]You've been a Beyond Horizons fanboy this stream.
[41:30.85]So what?
[41:32.18]You got a problem?
[41:33.50]Guys, the plants are moving in an unnatural way, though.
[41:36.86]I feel like, Poke, we're walking vertical now.
[41:41.69]This is so steep.
[41:42.65]Look behind you.
[41:44.23]Look at how steep this is.
[41:45.47]Oh, my God.
[41:46.44]And we're kind of going up into some very bad weather.
[41:49.20]There's a house over there.
[41:51.62]This is the peak, VOD.
[41:53.05]Oh, shit, I see something.
[41:54.27]Can we turn off UI?
[41:54.77]I don't know.
[41:57.87]Where's the game audio?
[42:00.28]Oh, hide UI button.
[42:02.38]Bind it.
[42:04.89]Can you guys hear the game audio now?
[42:08.33]I just pressed M. Guys, press M. Press M?
[42:12.28]No.
[42:13.10]Don't do that.
[42:13.70]Oh, no.
[42:13.96]What'd I do?
[42:14.33]What'd I do?
[42:15.19]It sends you back to the car, doesn't it?
[42:19.24]What the fuck?
[42:19.78]No.
[42:20.02]No.
[42:22.78]Oh, the weather's getting real scummy here.
[42:34.38]I was, like, in the lead, too.
[42:37.29]Where did you see a house?
[42:39.13]Should we do one?
[42:39.81]Okay, okay.
[42:40.99]Yeah, we can restart.
[42:44.94]Ugh.
[42:46.72]I have it on the worst settings?
[42:48.62]No, I don't.
[42:49.06]I have it on, like, performance or quality or something.
[42:51.63]I don't know.
[42:52.37]Yeah, but cinematic.
[42:53.87]I have it on balanced.
[43:00.76]Ooh.
[43:01.64]Ooh.
[43:12.37]What?
[43:13.39]Shouldn't there be, like, like, weather?
[43:16.19]Sound?
[43:16.55]Like, sound effects or anything?
[43:18.64]Wind?
[43:19.40]Anything?
[43:21.96]Why?
[43:22.18]We're turning more and more red.
[43:24.80]Guys, we lost a lot of progress by teleporting back to the car.
[43:27.91]We did.
[43:28.65]Maybe we should find a way to restart the server.
[43:30.59]But there's a house up here.
[43:31.65]There's actually a house up here.
[43:32.57]I'm not even kidding.
[43:34.38]Have you guys ever played the game Raft?
[43:37.88]Yeah, I think so.

[44:22.78]Bind the hide UI button and then turn off your UI.
[44:25.70]That's, wow.
[44:28.86]That light is fucked.
[44:30.42]That is the seizure light if I've ever seen one.

[54:48.31]Vegas is too hot.
[54:52.07]I know you want to shoot that in here, dude, but it's going to be bad.

[54:58.58]Have some SpaghettiOs.
[55:07.85]There's a vehicle.
[55:10.41]Looks terrible.
[55:11.38]but what you wanted to do for your uh your unction I'll put thought into it when we actually agree to it figure out the logistics we're doing this we're doing it let's go thinking about we're doing this so we're flying together to Vegas okay it's too hot in Vegas let's do it in Texas New York is cold and ice now this time of year
[55:35.54]I know Vinny doesn't like traveling, so I'll go to New York.
[55:38.47]I also do want to, actually.
[55:40.93]Sometimes I would like to see Vegas.
[55:43.05]We all gotta get around a blackjack table.
[55:44.99]I think Vegas would be really fun if we all went.
[55:53.88]I think TwitchCon Vegas was the best TwitchCon.
[55:56.88]And then they immediately said, we're never ever doing that ever again.
[56:01.01]That's a shame.
[56:01.47]Wasn't that the one where they broke people's spines?
[56:04.30]Oh, was that that one?
[56:06.98]No.
[56:08.57]What is this?
[56:08.95]Is this a trampoline?
[56:12.11]This is fucking sick.
[56:13.99]Can we take this?
[56:17.10]Wait.
[56:17.88]Jump on it.
[56:19.40]Guys, you can get drunk in this game.
[56:22.35]You have to let go of it while you're jumping on it.
[56:23.93]Watch this.
[56:25.55]Oh my god.
[56:26.16]Watch this.
[56:26.46]Ready?
[56:28.80]Dude, you actually did that.
[56:29.90]Hold on.
[56:33.88]Which car do you want to drive?
[56:37.63]Let's get the cool one in here.
[56:38.91]The yellow one.
[56:40.35]Okay.
[56:41.67]So we need to grab some seats then.
[56:43.76]We need to steal some seats.
[56:45.22]We don't have an accelerator pedal.
[56:55.97]What the heck?
[56:58.00]What the heck?
[56:59.41]Now, Bobby, I told you not to be taking them accelerator pedals.
[57:04.56]Can I turn?
[57:05.96]Oh, dude.
[57:07.59]Oh, my God.
[57:12.32]Oh, that was the trampoline.
[57:13.88]I found an engine.
[57:15.12]Do we need one?
[57:18.03]I found an engine.
[57:19.85]Yeah, put the engine in there.
[57:21.19]Yeah, engine will be nice in there.
[57:23.43]Bobby.
[57:24.30]Uh-oh.
[57:25.65]Oh, okay, Bobby.
[57:27.64]It needs petrol.
[57:28.36]He doesn't sound like that.
[57:29.48]Stop.
[57:30.68]That sounds like a serial killer.
[57:32.34]Engine oil, Bobby.
[57:36.55]How do we put it in there?
[57:39.49]This might not be the right engine for this car.
[57:43.05]It's The Long Drive copy.
[57:44.39]Any engine should work.
[57:47.58]Right?
[57:48.94]I hope so.
[57:49.42]I think this is a backwards car, and all the shit is going in the trunk.
[57:52.80]Dude, I'm on a gambling machine.
[57:54.14]Boo-boo-boo-boo.
[57:56.23]I found a gambling machine up here.
[57:58.97]An actual gambling machine.
[58:03.52]Where?
[58:04.84]On the roof.
[58:05.26]Up there?
[58:05.90]On the roof?
[58:06.34]Yep, yep.
[58:07.51]How'd you get on the roof?
[58:09.05]I... prop jumped.
[58:24.81]That sounds fun!
[58:28.09]Yeah, I don't know how to get up there.
[58:29.27]Even the trampoline's not enough.
[58:31.56]There's also, um, in here... It's just a naked goblin crawling around.
[58:38.60]There's also, dude, look.
[58:39.89]There's, like, balls.
[58:45.27]Oh!
[58:45.55]Like a gotcha machine.
[58:47.64]Guys, take this right here.
[58:50.02]Use this.
[58:53.73]That wood, I dropped the pallet.
[58:55.35]Oh, we need this!
[58:55.93]This is loyal!
[58:58.77]We need a pedal.
[59:00.35]Oh, it's water.
[59:01.79]Someone, uh, I'll, like, go AFK, but someone, like, run back to the other car and get the pedal out of it.
[59:07.18]I brought a pedal.
[59:08.18]You found one.
[59:09.38]Oh.
[59:10.20]It's in there now.
[59:11.16]Yeah.
[59:12.55]Yeah, I'm going for the record.
[59:15.17]How do you get up there?
[59:15.93]Fuck.
[59:17.23]I dropped a pallet over here.
[59:18.85]Oh, I think you found a brake pedal.
[59:20.47]It still says there's no accelerator.
[59:22.80]Hey, Vinny, here.
[59:23.90]Have some.
[59:24.60]Well, I'll use this ladder.

[60:55.66]Might be fun, but I'm Alliance.
[60:57.80]We pick a random MMO and get to a city and sit there and talk for two hours.
[61:04.39]But them people... People are gonna... They're gonna walk by and they're gonna be like saying the poopy words.
[61:11.50]How do I fix it?
[61:13.01]That's fine.
[61:14.61]I'm kidding.
