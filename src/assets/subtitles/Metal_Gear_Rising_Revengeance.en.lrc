[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.25]What am I looking at here?
[00:02.27]I'm looking at the chat and I just see somebody's writing, like, pee-pee and, like, poo-poo and shit.
[00:06.61]Like, what?
[00:07.05]Come on, guys.
[00:08.48]It's 2019.
[00:10.78]We're in 2019 now.
[00:14.04]Come on.
[00:14.64]We're not doing that anymore.
[00:17.80]Really?
[00:18.10]Not on my live broadcast.
[00:23.09]Not on my live stream.
[00:25.31]You know what I'm saying?
[00:26.85]You know what I'm saying?
[00:27.71]You know what I mean?
[00:30.21]Alright, 2019 resolution.
[00:32.21]I'm gonna stop saying at the end of every four sentences.
[00:36.67]You know what I mean?
[00:39.60]I'll try.
[00:45.86]Other New Year's resolution.
[00:48.04]I am not going to say.
[00:49.42]We did the award for it.
[00:53.27]The word that is the... It is the... It is the first name.
[01:01.00]Not doing it anymore, but it was fun in 2018, you know what I mean?
[01:06.06]Well, I hope you had a good New Year.
[01:10.46]Hopefully you're rested.
[01:11.90]Hopefully you had fun.
[01:15.36]Hopefully you were responsible.
[01:17.74]And we're in 2019.
[01:19.87]So this is technically the first stream in starting in 2019.
[01:23.85]Because, yeah, I streamed in 2019, but it started in 2018.
[01:30.24]Welcome to the first stream in the new year.
[01:33.24]And we're going to kick it off with a good one.
[01:35.88]Because this is Metal Gear Rising... Revengeance.
[01:42.06]Is that a real word?
[01:45.86]How can you have vengeance be twice?
[01:47.89]Like a re-vengeance?
[01:49.65]Isn't vengeance just already something you do?
[01:57.71]So this is Metal Gear...
[01:59.85]Two Vengeances.
[02:06.25]Revenge Vengeance.
[02:13.21]But anyways, this is a game that's been requested a lot of times and figured because just kind of want to play something, hang out for the new year.
[02:24.35]It was either this, or visceral cleanup detail, or back to Kenshu.
[02:28.78]We did a little pull.
[02:30.50]It was pretty close, so this did end up winning.
[02:37.24]Dermot, you need to learn to parry, you noob.
[02:39.37]Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[02:42.39]I haven't even done anything yet.
[02:46.31]You can't make that joke until you see it happen.
[02:48.69]So what if I do really good with parries?
[02:55.88]What if I'm just... Then you're gonna look real silly in like 30 or 40 minutes, aren't you?
[03:05.59]Jerma, I just got banned from RuneScape for cheating.
[03:09.69]Well, why are you cheating?
[03:12.90]Why are you cheating in RuneScape?
[03:15.62]Don't do that.
[03:17.40]Come on.
[03:21.66]I just got... Cut that out.
[03:28.06]He learned from me.
[03:29.44]When have I ever... I don't cheat in video games.
[03:34.08]When have I ever cheated, truly cheated in a game?
[03:38.98]That hasn't happened.
[03:46.56]Save scumming is not cheating.
[03:50.59]Turn on the facecam or riot.
[03:54.51]My facecam is not even hooked up.
[03:57.17]It's sitting over here and not plugged in.
[03:58.95]So it's not going on.
[04:03.95]No, I'm not doing a facecam.
[04:06.14]Just pretend that that's me in like the fucking dentist suit.
[04:10.46]You know what I mean?
[04:10.96]Me with like the dentist thing on my mouth.
[04:13.04]That's me in there.
[04:16.24]I was gonna say... Alright, starting off the new year great.
[04:23.37]We're gonna just start the story.
[04:24.17]This is like a four-hour game, right?
[04:25.51]I'll blow through this in fucking three.
[04:32.06]Somebody just give a hundred dollars.
[04:34.98]A hundred dollars from Kali Brady.
[04:37.62]One hundred.
[04:38.86]Six hours if you're a bad.
[04:40.02]I'll do it in two, okay?
[04:41.66]Time me.
[04:44.12]Happy New Year, Jerma.
[04:45.14]Hope 2019 is a good one for you.
[04:47.24]Love from Ireland.
[04:48.34]Jerma Hart.
[04:49.12]Thank you so much, Kali Brady.
[04:53.53]Thanks for your hundred fucking dollars.
[04:54.97]A hundred.
[04:59.05]God.
[05:00.77]And I didn't really touch upon on the New Year's Eve stream because I just had to get out of there.
[05:04.23]You know, I gotta get out of here.
[05:05.97]But... Holy shit, guys.
[05:08.40]You guys are fucking incredible.
[05:12.26]Thank you.
[05:13.78]So, let's start.
[05:14.48]Metal Gear Rising.
[05:15.78]I've got a controller plugged in.
[05:16.82]Does that mean I'm bad?
[05:22.42]New game.
[05:24.94]Normal, easy.
[05:25.76]I'm not going to play it on easy.
[05:26.82]I'm not playing this game on hard, okay?
[05:30.92]Why would I play on hard?
[05:32.02]No, I'm not going to already ruin the stream.
[05:34.00]Normal.
[05:38.01]Hard with a facecam.
[05:39.31]I'm not going to play on hard.
[05:40.39]I don't play games.
[05:41.31]I don't do this on hard.
[05:43.41]The developers designed an experience.
[05:46.87]And here's how people design video games, guys.
[05:49.41]From somebody that's in the industry.
[05:51.05]I've had my hand in it a few times.
[05:54.21]Normal is how all the developers, all the programmers, all the people that are working on the computers, all the design, this is the game that they wanted you to play.
[06:02.03]They made this this way.
[06:05.08]Easy is, alright, like, you, like, it's, you don't have to, like, really worry about it, just enjoy it and press X a bunch of times and you'll be fine.
[06:14.00]They made this for the super humans.
[06:20.34]Hard, this is the way the game, it's like times two speed, from my understanding.
[06:25.16]When you put the game on hard, enemies are at times two speed, times two health, and times two damage.
[06:28.86]I don't want to do that.
[06:35.85]Bullshit, you just suck.
[06:37.87]Hey, I beat fucking Dancer first try at Dark Souls 3.
[06:41.15]I beat Flamelurker first try.
[06:42.31]I beat Jevil first try.
[06:45.07]So, excuse me.
[06:50.52]I mean, I did lose to Pinwheel like 30 times, but that's because I was like fucking... I had like a headache that day.
[06:56.30]I'm doing... I already did it.
[06:58.10]It's normal.
[06:58.62]That's fine.
[06:59.70]I don't... You can call... I'm playing on normal.
[07:02.48]Look, if it's too easy for me, I'll go back.
[07:05.04]I'll go... I'm just gonna play on normal.
[07:06.80]I wanna... I wanna enjoy the game the way that the developers... Let's begin with a quick warm-up, shall we?
[07:13.68]Alright.
[07:14.12]How fun is this?
[07:14.54]Check the soliton radar on the upper right, and head to the point marked on the display.
[07:20.07]Is it really that much different?
[07:21.17]Am I a chicken?
[07:22.31]No, it's gonna be fine.
[07:23.28]Look, I can just go like this and turn it on.
[07:27.24]Look at this.
[07:29.88]Options.
[07:30.10]Hard.
[07:30.20]Can be turned on.
[07:30.96]Right?
[07:51.82]Hard on.
[07:53.32]It's not that big of a deal.
[07:54.45]Alright.
[07:56.13]Alright, right trigger.
[07:56.95]This ninja run.
[08:00.73]This is kinda cool.
[08:05.69]And I know everybody's already saying that that's me in the corner over there, and that's funny.
[08:09.49]But not really.
[08:23.40]That feels fluid.
[08:24.32]Is this one of those fluid games?
[08:26.02]It feels like a fluid game.
[08:30.52]Why would I need to parry when I can just do this?
[08:39.27]Can I play through the whole game doing this?
[08:50.70]He's already bad.
[08:53.46]I just turned on the game and I learned how to run.
[09:02.20]I just learned how to run.
[09:03.80]Can I have like even five seconds?
[09:05.86]So bad.
[09:08.60]Oh my god.
[09:09.28]I'm so glad I'm not doing this on hard.
[09:10.44]What is it?
[09:11.30]What button is it?
[09:12.64]Oh!
[09:12.76]I got hit!
[09:28.41]Where's the block button shaking my head?
[09:35.59]Why are you shaking your head?
[09:38.10]I don't know where the block button is.
[09:42.64]Why the camera keep doing that?
[09:56.65]He thinks there's a block button.
[09:57.79]Oh, is there a dodge?
[09:58.60]See, look at this.
[09:59.20]Look.
[09:59.46]See?
[09:59.60]Light attacks of your own in the same direction.
[10:01.22]Oh, boy.
[10:01.50]Thanks for coming to this room, guys.
[10:02.74]I'll see you next time.
[10:19.16]Push left stick in the direction of an enemy attack and press X at the perfect moment to use the HF blade to parry your foe.
[10:29.24]Like, they're talking about like this, right?
[10:37.29]Left stick not triggered yet, but... Don't lock up.
[10:42.01]Okay, I see.
[10:46.13]in the direction of an enemy attack.
[10:47.37]So it can be left, right, up, down.
[10:50.98]Hold left trigger.
[10:56.26]Uh...
[11:14.25]How long am I supposed to do this for?
[11:15.87]I think I got him.
[11:25.45]When am I supposed to stop doing this?
[11:26.82]Does he have a health bar?
[11:38.28]Oh, alright.
[11:38.74]He's dead.
[11:39.12]Hey, put that guy in a stew.
[11:46.01]...in as close as possible and parry their blows to leave them exposed to counterattack.
[11:50.89]From your perspective, it will appear as if the enemy is frozen in time or at least moving very slowly.
[11:57.24]This is the perfect opportunity for you to carefully aim your strike.
[12:01.58]Carefully aim your strike?
[12:03.94]Keep in mind, even you will not be able to parry every type of attack.
[12:07.75]Is there a dodge roll?
[12:08.49]Because if there is... GET OUTTA HERE!
[12:10.37]Alright, let's carry.
[12:12.81]Yeah, I got it.
[12:15.73]Where you at?
[12:17.61]Don't do that to me.
[12:18.35]Camera!
[12:18.65]Oh, what the fuck's with the camera?
[12:19.93]I heard that was a complaint in the game!
[12:26.40]I want his brain.
[12:27.08]I want his brain.
[12:27.66]Give me his brain.
[12:28.16]Imagine he's still alive after this.
[12:40.65]That's kind of insane.
[12:41.83]How long do I have to do that?
[12:44.15]Do I get more points if I do it, like, 40 times?
[12:52.98]Hey, somebody chop up that brain!
[12:55.44]Put it in a stew!
[12:57.40]Alright, I gotta calm the fuck down.
[13:00.49]It's been, like, 10 minutes.
[13:01.85]I'm gonna expel all my energy in, like, fucking 5 minutes and, like, go to bed.
[13:07.27]Three years.
[13:10.07]We've come so far in just three short years.
[13:14.03]The sign of a strong leader, sir.
[13:17.25]No.
[13:18.95]The will of a strong people.
[13:22.41]2019 Jerma's not as good as 2018 Jerma.
[13:25.49]It's been 15 minutes.
[13:29.67]And one very able advisor.
[13:32.95]Thank you, sir.
[13:36.78]Your team deserves credit as well.
[13:40.85]You've changed.
[13:43.11]Just doing our job, Mr. Prime Minister.
[13:45.07]There he is.
[13:47.61]I once thought of groups like yours as opportunists, enablers of war.
[13:52.16]So, who is Snake?
[13:53.70]You've trained our new army well.
[13:56.10]Order has returned sooner than expected.
[13:59.22]Perhaps I was wrong about these private military companies.
[14:04.48]We prefer private security providers, sir.
[14:08.91]Most of Maverick's contracts do focus on security.
[14:10.95]He's got a snake mouth.
[14:12.23]Does he open that snake mouth up and eat something?
[14:14.15]There's going to be a joke where he eats a hot dog or a hamburger or something.
[14:18.07]He unhinges his jaw and eats a big piece of food, right?
[14:20.97]There's a joke that has to be in this game.
[14:22.91]There's a saying I like.
[14:25.69]Right?
[14:26.53]One sword keeps another in the sheath.
[14:30.14]Sometimes the threat of violence alone is a deterrent.
[14:34.14]Sometimes by taking a life, others can be preserved.
[14:40.74]It's the code the samurai lived by.
[14:42.78]Hmm.
[14:45.06]A soldier and a philosopher.
[14:47.12]This is a serious game.
[14:48.02]You are full of surprises, Mr. Lightning Bolt.
[14:50.54]I could say the same about you, Mr. Prime Minister.
[14:52.56]By the way, Mr. Lightning Bolt is the worst name.
[14:54.36]That's like a child making up a terrible superhero name when they're playing pretend in the backyard.
[15:00.93]Hold on.
[15:02.75]Mr. Lightning Bolt!
[15:06.01]Clear the road!
[15:06.99]This is official state business!
[15:12.49]Uh-oh.
[15:13.79]Boss fight.
[15:14.53]It's Snake.
[15:22.72]It's Snake, isn't it?
[15:24.40]This takes place like 4,000 years in the future, right?
[15:27.63]There he is.
[15:27.97]There he is.
[15:43.65]Everyone had like a facecam on when they played this game on stream, probably was like, WOAH!
[15:47.41]I don't fucking care.
[16:05.95]You're so cool.
[16:11.84]I can't wait to see this snake.
[16:13.76]Exif.
[16:33.28]It's too quiet compared to the video game audio file.
[16:39.73]Well, it's because it's a cutscene.
[16:41.79]The cutscenes are always way louder in every video game, because they pre-render all these out, and then the guy that's making the videos has them at plus 50 db.
[16:53.81]And they just put them in, they don't even edit them, but they don't even care.
[17:00.64]Somebody rendered this in Final Cut.
[17:03.30]That's like a .mp4 and just gave it to their boss.
[17:09.87]Here we go.
[17:12.35]Do I weigh 400,000 pounds?
[17:14.51]He's just naked.
[17:26.37]Turns out it was just a custom.
[17:27.65]Now that is what we call... I'm not going to say the E word.
[17:36.19]That box only cost would be $1.
[17:37.47]What did I get?
[17:39.45]What did I get?
[17:39.87]What did I get?
[17:42.45]Oh, it's common, but it's okay.
[17:44.27]Cool.
[17:52.65]Let's get this over with.
[17:59.46]I forget how to play.
[18:01.66]You jump with A, right?
[18:03.34]Here we go!
[18:08.93]What if I do Blade Attack on somebody, right?
[18:16.61]What's this?
[18:17.24]Gun?
[18:30.65]I got a mini-map in the corner.
[18:33.61]Should I try to parry?
[18:34.37]Do I get points for parrying and shit?
[18:36.52]Like, I don't understand.
[18:37.82]Do I have to, like, parry and then... That guy's a gun.
[18:40.92]Should I wait?
[18:43.68]Oops.
[18:44.88]Alright, the guy's a gun.
[18:46.12]No, he's just trying to tell me to kill him.
[18:54.62]Cut him off, cut him off!
[19:06.91]Oh, you can do it, but why is it not covering up all of his body parts?
[19:18.24]Got it, carry!
[19:18.96]I feel like it'd be really easy to kill this guy.
[19:32.57]Hold on, stay right there!
[19:55.27]I want to parry.
[19:59.71]Now does it do it automatically or do I have to hold it afterwards?
[20:03.88]I guess not.
[20:06.58]Perfect parry.
[20:08.16]Of course I did.
[20:10.10]I don't understand how to get through this.
[20:15.14]Nah, that's it.
[20:16.82]I'm out of here, guys.
[20:17.35]Thanks.
[20:17.97]I don't fucking know how to do this.
[20:35.37]How many people just left?
[20:41.19]Here it comes.
[20:45.21]It's Mothra!
[20:47.27]No, that's a Metal Gear, isn't it?
[20:48.29]That's Metal Gear... Wait, don't tell me that's Metal Gear Rising.
[20:51.04]No, that's the name of this game.
[20:52.92]That's Metal Gear Ray.
[20:54.54]Ray.
[20:56.24]It's Metal Gear Ray, right?
[20:58.74]I know these.
[20:59.42]I've played these.
[21:06.19]Here we go, boys.
[21:07.17]What, is this like a... is this the gear check?
[21:10.19]To determine if I can play the game or not?
[21:14.48]I think we need a Mortal Kombat character.
[21:35.47]Don't do it.
[21:35.85]He'll be okay.
[21:37.39]Why don't you just let him go?
[21:39.43]I thought somebody sucked in front of the other side.
[21:56.10]Here we go.
[22:12.06]So you're Jack.
[22:14.18]What do you want with the Prime Minister?
[22:16.56]I want him dead.
[22:20.57]Nothing personal, of course.
[22:21.77]Africa's just getting a bit too peaceful.
[22:24.55]What?
[22:29.34]Business ain't been the same since they shut down SOP.
[22:34.89]A clean break from the war economy.
[22:38.35]Well, some of us lack that economy.
[22:40.83]How's an honest warmonger supposed to make a living?
[22:44.46]This is your answer?
[22:49.72]Don't do it.
[22:50.84]What does he say?
[22:51.52]Science is the most necessary motion of all things.
[22:53.94]What's his dumb voice line?
[22:55.32]I won't.
[22:59.13]Not while he's still useful.
[23:04.35]So long.
[23:08.41]You get back here.
[23:08.97]I'm going to 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 you.
[23:09.55]I'm going to 1, 2, 3, X, 1, 2, 3, Y. Just you wait.
[23:24.26]Alright, I'm so pumped up for this.
[23:26.20]Over the legs.
[23:30.60]One, two, three.
[23:31.84]One, two, three.
[23:33.42]Got it.
[23:39.99]One.
[23:40.77]I didn't get it.
[23:41.39]I didn't get it.
[23:41.83]One, two, three.
[23:43.79]One, two, three.
[23:45.33]One, two, three.
[23:46.99]Okay, get out, get out.
[23:47.67]Don't do more than that.
[23:52.34]I have to slide?
[24:10.24]What?
[24:10.44]What am I doing?
[24:18.00]Alright, I'm just making somebody's YouTuber logo from like 2014.
[24:21.00]That's MY logo.
[24:21.87]Can I get up there?
[24:37.22]Ooh, I can get in his mouth!
[24:47.30]Don't be left-legged.
[24:51.21]Yeah, I understand everybody.
[24:52.77]Well, that was his left leg.
[24:54.83]I'm not talking about his left.
[24:58.13]What the hell are you doing?
[25:03.58]Did that hit me?
[25:04.72]Stupid game!
[25:17.84]Carry?
[25:19.38]I can par- wait, I can... Can I actually carry his legs?
[25:27.61]I thought that was only for regular monsters.
[25:31.05]Alright, I'll try.
[25:31.49]Alright, I'll carry this Lego Riot, okay?
[25:40.58]Here we go.
[25:48.68]Got it.
[25:56.12]This is a fun game.
[26:00.42]Oh, what a god of a gamer.
[26:02.94]No, not really.
[26:03.96]I'm gonna really focus on, like they do in the WWF, I'm gonna focus on the leg that is in the brace.
[26:12.67]Maybe I should just get a bolt.
[26:20.06]Yeah, I'm gonna get both legs.
[26:20.96]Okay, but keep doing that.
[26:21.90]How am I supposed to do this?
[26:27.39]Keep doing that.
[26:31.77]I need to turn his other Elephant Book into... yeah.
[26:35.49]Yeah, we got this.
[26:42.24]Yeah, I can just carry everything?
[26:49.80]I'll parry.
[26:50.18]Okay, I'm gonna parry whatever he's doing right here.
[27:03.67]I got- whoo!
[27:04.33]I did get it!
[27:05.49]Okay, I did- alright, that's good to know.
[27:20.14]I don't think I can carry that!
[27:24.93]YB?
[27:27.51]What's YB?
[27:28.07]Oh.
[27:28.41]Do I tap this?
[27:29.77]Pick up the rock music.
[27:39.97]Picking him up and swinging him around?
[27:41.52]I just so longed him.
[27:42.96]I did the so long Bowser thing.
[27:51.54]That's my new desktop background.
[27:56.42]B. It's always a B, guys.
[27:58.84]Don't you understand?
[27:59.82]Where's my, uh, level ups?
[28:03.25]Uh, you would've... Any normal human being would've puked right now.
[28:29.51]Alright, it's a chase sequence.
[28:36.12]Use your ninja run.
[28:38.34]Probably that's what I'm doing.
[28:44.28]Oh, I did, I just, come on, that would have been awesome if I accidentally perfectly timed that.
[28:56.67]I thought it was... I thought it was a climb up sequence or something.
[29:02.36]Come on, you can't give me shit for that.
[29:03.51]Actually, it would have been faster if I just walked up the fucking stairs.
[29:13.32]Alright, here's Ray again.
[29:18.41]Oh, it still works.
[29:19.65]Tarja can kill the big monster, so I can get some scales from him.
[29:24.37]Monster Hunter: World reference.
[29:26.31]Do I block this?
[29:30.00]Uh, I can try.
[29:30.98]Okay.
[29:31.14]I have to slide underneath it?
[29:33.66]Oh, no.
[29:34.14]Okay, do I have to... Is this a jump rope?
[29:35.62]Do I have to jump over that?
[29:43.95]I'm stuck in the ground.
[29:44.57]Perfect.
[29:47.36]I'm getting close to losing here.
[29:56.80]What is this?
[29:57.50]What the hell is this?
[29:59.20]What?
[30:00.22]Oh.
[30:03.89]What the fuck just happened?
[30:09.87]Get it!
[30:11.49]Chop his whole face off.
[30:12.47]Come on.
[30:18.02]Alright, now we get to see what he really looks like.
[30:19.71]Perfect carry.
[30:28.09]Just call me Perfect Carry Paul.
[30:31.07]I was going to say something else.
[30:56.33]What?
[30:56.73]Pull the right trigger.
[30:59.22]Am I supposed to be swinging at these?
[31:03.50]What am I looking at?
[31:07.88]What am I supposed to be doing?
[31:12.71]Oh, ninja run.
[31:13.87]Okay.
[31:16.71]I get it.
[31:19.44]Ah, the music player did it wrong.
[31:21.07]Ah, whatever.
[31:21.51]Wrong trigger.
[31:34.63]Defeated!
[31:35.47]She just starts fucking crunching me and my blood and guts are everywhere and my, like, legs are ripped off and I'm, like, fucking mangled and shit.
[31:54.65]I was trying to do a thing.
[32:00.18]Sorry.
[32:01.24]Wait.
[32:02.56]Why is title so close there?
[32:06.81]I was just being a dickhead.
[32:08.63]Lost on the first level.
[32:09.55]I was fucking around.
[32:10.35]I was like jumping.
[32:12.27]Sorry.
[32:12.75]I've played... Yeah, guys, guys, relax.
[32:14.53]I've played this game on my iPad like ten times.
[32:17.85]Raiden!
[32:19.39]Raiden!
[32:21.94]This is like... I'm sorry.
[32:23.14]I'm playing the most downloaded free game on the App Store right now.
[32:26.32]Raiden!
[32:32.80]Raiden!
[32:33.10]Raiden!
[32:36.31]How are you going to move to the left?
[32:40.26]Alright, so we're going to stay over here.
[32:44.48]What's the next big narrative?
[32:52.00]Watch out.
[32:55.84]Intensive music.
[33:04.79]All the way down, that's not good.
[33:10.95]My god, sell that iPad.
[33:12.91]He even died three times and I got a B. Still running away with this guy.
[33:32.24]B for bad.
[33:36.26]I have a B for banned for life from the channel.
[33:40.02]Got him.
[33:40.84]He's done.
[33:41.18]That's what I have to do with this all day.
[34:01.58]I would just go to a giant open field and just slide around like that.
[34:06.83]until I was at the point of physical exhaustion.
[34:09.49]I would do it every day.
[34:13.10]That's what I would do from home.
[34:21.12]He's headed for the front of the train.
[34:22.89]After him!
[34:24.11]I was about to just run off the side and just... I don't do... This is 2019, we don't make those jokes.
[34:29.31]... is headed your way.
[34:30.73]Keep an eye out for him.
[34:41.96]What?
[34:44.92]Is this a 2v1 fight right now?
[34:52.95]Jeremy, this next boss fight is easy.
[34:55.29]If you don't beat it, you're bad.
[34:56.29]Can you just let me play again?
[34:59.13]And enjoy the game.
[35:03.02]What the hell?
[35:05.95]Was looking away for a second.
[35:06.91]I thought they were just things war is done for us Why don't we ever hear speeches about that?
[35:13.96]Just so unenthusiastic stop him You ain't listening
[35:37.84]We can just run in there.
[35:38.78]Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm doing.
[35:43.54]Oh, no.
[35:44.70]No!
[36:12.58]That was crazy.
[36:13.76]Jesus Christ, okay.
[36:16.52]Let's go!
[36:24.88]That was a powerful swing.
[36:38.82]Beat Sam or Bad Screamer.
[36:40.34]I'm gonna try.
[36:41.54]Just relax.
[36:43.92]I love how it's like a game remote.
[36:54.72]I'm gonna wait for him to do something.
[36:59.32]We're both playing the same game.
[37:00.24]He's waiting to parry me.
[37:01.80]And I'm... This is just... Nice PvP fight.
[37:05.33]I'm gonna taunt him.
[37:14.06]See?
[37:14.52]Ah, goddammit.
[37:15.80]I shouldn't have struck first.
[37:17.88]Oh, and let's see, that wouldn't even... I thought it was a cutscene.
[37:23.08]I thought it was a cutscene.
[37:25.68]Oh, I gotta parry more than once.
[37:29.07]Okay.
[37:31.19]It's like parry, parry, parry.
[37:41.78]Hmm.
[37:43.05]So, I gotta parry individual time.
[37:49.33]So, parry, parry, parry.
[37:50.85]You can try to get that right.
[37:52.05]He's about to lose to Sam.
[38:11.18]So, okay, I get it.
[38:12.02]You just have to actually up the... Okay, I'm probably... I got one... I got... I'm 0.1% streamer.
[38:30.51]Oh, I see.
[38:35.23]You deny your weapon its purpose.
[38:37.51]Huh?
[38:45.89]Losing to the easy spot while I'm learning how to parry.
[38:48.29]I don't even need my game genie.
[39:16.91]Oh, sorry, my game shot.
[39:18.05]You guys understand that one now?
[39:26.42]There's my opening!
[39:32.53]There's my opening!
[39:33.09]There's my opening!
[39:33.55]He's shooting!
[39:36.07]Oh no, he has one of those action figure things.
[39:38.41]Yeah, they're supposed to lose here.
[39:39.37]This is a joke.
[39:39.83]You guys were baiting me.
[39:52.76]Shit.
[39:53.50]Not again.
[39:54.28]Everyone's starting to know how bad I am.
[40:00.83]Red, are you alright?
[40:02.47]You're almost clear of the tunnel.
[40:04.07]Just hang on.
[40:04.75]This is all the Rebels to offer.
[40:22.22]lead on him.
[40:25.34]This is what happens when you bring a tool to a sword fight.
[40:28.26]Imagine this is just an elaborate game over screen.
[40:31.62]It's over.
[40:31.98]Oh, you're going to raise the blade up too high and you're going to get caught in the ceiling.
[40:41.51]Oh, and he can't be outside because it's bright up, like Vampire, right?
[40:44.11]Lucky devil.
[40:52.74]Add to that, he raises it up a little too high and gets stuck in the ceiling.
[40:56.30]He's just like... That snake!
[41:01.77]The snake's behind the wheel right there.
[41:03.65]What a fun cameo.
[41:14.07]That snake before the cigars.
[41:15.47]This takes place like 400 years ago, right?
[41:32.40]Is this a blind play for you?
[41:36.27]I've never played this game before.
[41:54.95]Metal Gear Solid V is the first one, right?
[41:59.47]Yeah, the story of Metal Gear Kingdom Hearts.
[42:06.00]They sell a product where you can download it into your brain, though.
[42:08.12]I tried it.
[42:09.44]I just got stuck for a while.
[42:16.26]Chad, I'm confused.
[42:17.04]Which one is Snake?
[42:18.84]Oh, well, I'm sure that it'll pop up eventually.
[42:26.41]Sorry, wait, I got... Chapter... Difficulty Normal, Chapter Combat, BB, Time, BP, Rank B, Bonus B... How many B's are on total BP?
[42:44.90]Alright.
[42:50.26]Whole lot of B's on the screen.
[43:00.02]This is going to be kind of a fun game.
[43:04.30]Three weeks later.
[43:09.59]Oh, I know what this is.
[43:10.23]This is the Lollywood Oaks.
[43:26.28]Oh nooooooo don't.
[43:57.31]So which one of these guys is the secret bad guy?
[44:01.56]He looks like a secret bad guy.
[44:03.08]He just does.
[44:21.19]Alright, gain like 50 pounds and then do a Dr. Eggman costume.
[44:26.12]Nobody wants the Eggman haircut.
[44:27.92]Why?
[44:28.18]I don't get it.
[44:28.70]You know, when I get older, yeah, I really want like the Eggman.
[44:32.36]The Dr. Robotnik, you know what I mean?
[44:33.26]How generous.
[44:46.07]So this is the guy you upgraded with.
[44:48.40]No, fuck that, man.
[44:49.38]See, I'll fold that hair up and put a bunch of grease on it and fold it over the top of your head.
[44:55.26]That would look better.
[45:05.81]I know you miss me, Kev, but I've been all over the materials.
[45:10.03]Roll that out really long and then fold the whole thing over and then style it.
[45:13.67]Objectives, of course, are enter Abkhazia, neutralize the terrorists, and restore the rightful government.
[45:18.09]We know it wouldn't.
[45:19.13]The president and most of the cabinet have been killed.
[45:23.45]Only one person has ever made that haircut look good, and it was Hulk Hogan.
[45:29.88]If you are not Hulk Hogan, don't have that haircut.
[45:34.56]That's why they called us.
[45:38.06]andre dolce leader of the occupation forces an extremist linked to both the st petersburg massacre of 2015 and last year's terrorist or Ben Franklin supplier none other than desperado enforcement only two people in history have made that haircut look good hulk hogan and Ben Franklin stop them here they could destabilize the entire region but our more immediate problem is jet stream sand I believe you've met
[46:09.14]The only problem I see is that nickname.
[46:12.24]I've got my enhancements this time.
[46:14.42]He won't be an issue.
[46:16.10]He may not even be in country.
[46:17.92]But keep an eye out, Justin.
[46:20.42]Oh.
[46:21.52]Uh, sorry.
[46:23.76]Ready for insertion.
[46:24.68]Alright, I'm ready.
[46:28.12]So, organization.
[46:29.60]Stop the organization here.
[46:31.26]I got upgrades from Dr. Eggman.
[46:34.26]New suit.
[46:36.40]New weapon.
[46:37.68]Three weeks later.
[46:55.80]Where we dropping?
[46:58.70]I was about to do the noise, but no, not anymore.
[47:02.89]It's 2019.
[47:16.00]Alright.
[47:17.60]What'd I get for- I got an A for that one?
[47:19.36]Did I get S?
[47:20.86]Let's go in.
[47:21.32]Can I run up walls in this game?
[47:23.96]No.
[47:24.08]Return it.
[47:24.62]Cut the tree!
[47:24.98]Cut the tree!
[47:25.42]Cut the tree!
[47:25.86]Oh my god, relax!
[47:26.71]Cut the tree!
[47:47.88]Can I do it vertically?
[47:48.88]Okay, cool.
[47:52.68]I'm so glad you guys told me to cut the trees.
[47:55.00]Can I cut?
[47:57.64]Hold on a second.
[48:13.93]Whoa, that's cool.
[48:21.86]combat manual and what what is it codec I went back who am I calling here Kevin looks like a war zone out here
[48:35.73]The palace cleared out quick when Dulzayev's men showed up.
[48:38.97]The streets got pretty hot after that.
[48:40.93]We're definitely going to see a few civilian casualties here.
[48:44.09]Luckily, it looks like most of them got out of the city before things got bad.
[48:47.33]They basically got control of the entire town and are using the refinery as their HQ.
[48:52.69]And that's why we're hitting the plant.
[48:54.45]Keep in mind, those cyborgs are contractors.
[48:57.55]For most of these guys, this is just a job.
[49:00.42]In theory, once you eliminate their commanding officer, they should scatter pretty quickly.
[49:05.75]Okay.
[49:06.55]Good to know.
[49:06.87]There's a cat on the beach.
[49:13.30]I don't see a cat.
[49:16.34]Oh, I see a cat.
[49:19.48]So the joke here is you want me to hold L2 and cut up the cat.
[49:25.18]Why would I do that?
[49:28.05]Whoops-a-daisy.
[49:28.73]Good thing you just dodged it, because I hit right stick.
[49:31.35]Good dodge.
[49:32.05]You deserve it.
[49:33.63]I'm not going to cut up the cat.
[49:34.77]Why would I do something like that?
[49:41.66]No.
[49:42.48]That cat lives.
[49:43.20]Okay.
[49:47.08]Alright.
[49:47.32]Get me away from that cat before I do it.
[49:52.96]I'm not cutting the cat.
[49:53.88]No.
[49:56.37]You probably, somebody else probably did that, and you want to see somebody else cut off the cat, but I want that cat to live, because Resident Evil 4 taught me, protect the animal.
[50:03.80]Protect the fucking animal.
[50:05.04]What is this?
[50:05.44]What the hell am I doing?
[50:06.54]Why has it ripped out his spinal cord?
[50:08.24]What?
[50:08.53]I'm so confused right now, okay.
[50:22.26]Bury at just the right moment to deflect an attack and expose your enemy to counter-attack.
[50:28.09]That's a counter-attack.
[50:30.23]Bury at just the right moment to deflect an attack and expose your enemy to counter-attack.
[50:35.58]Alright, well, easy as one, two, three.
[50:41.04]That's how you eat.
[50:42.72]Oh, I see, okay.
[50:46.08]I missed.
[50:46.58]I did not miss.
[50:47.24]How did I miss?
[50:48.67]You missed it.
[50:54.49]Had your fill?
[50:57.21]Eat this body.
[50:58.05]I could take these guys with no eyes.
[51:00.95]Intel wasn't exaggerating on the cyborg count.
[51:03.43]Nah, they didn't do this right.
[51:05.77]You wouldn't be able to talk like that if you had that on your jaw.
[51:08.27]That CNT muscle power is the power of a jackhammer to every limb.
[51:12.21]I mean, yeah.
[51:12.95]But your new body is really, really easy.
[51:15.90]And cyborgs are still human.
[51:17.82]Real thinking people.
[51:19.22]Way less risk of collateral damage than your typical UAV strike.
[51:23.02]And don't forget the PR angle.
[51:24.96]Nations start playing Frankenstein with their troops, and the public goes nuts.
[51:29.13]PMCs, on the other hand, are off the ethical radar.
[51:33.29]Yeah.
[51:34.11]They still don't even count PMCs in official death tolls.
[51:37.19]What was the move in the cup for?
[51:38.09]With SOP out of the picture, private militaries needed a new edge on the market.
[51:42.45]We got it.
[51:44.56]in a way cyborgs are just sop troops by another name only all muscled so she doesn't spill it predictable but it makes you wonder here comes a classic spill joke these guys I'm not complaining they're like walking vending machines
[52:09.02]Easy there, Dracula.
[52:10.18]Like I said, they're still people.
[52:12.50]People who terrorize and take innocent lives for money.
[52:17.17]They sowed their fate when they took this job.
[52:20.15]Whoa, I'm scared.
[52:22.93]Damn.
[52:26.75]He stole that from Bugleberry.
[52:29.81]Yeah, he stole jump scare into the camera from B.F. Bugleberry.
[52:36.98]He sure did.
[52:47.81]This tutorial is now playable via VR missions.
[52:54.64]Alright, head to the indicated waypoint.
[52:56.68]Straight up here.
[52:57.14]Are there any secrets?
[52:57.84]Are there any, like, secret cats over here?
[53:00.22]That I should be aware of?
[53:02.90]There's gotta be random secrets in this game, right?
[53:11.76]Cut the billboard?
[53:13.16]Cut billboard, cut billboard!
[53:14.72]Alright, my god!
[53:23.02]Cut car.
[53:23.74]Cut car in half.
[53:24.58]Never mind.
[53:25.50]Cut ground.
[53:25.96]No, I don't want to do that.
[53:27.22]The Earth will cut in half.
[53:30.78]Good.
[53:31.04]Let's recap the route you will take.
[53:50.81]Oh.
[53:50.91]Cut Boris.
[53:51.55]That doesn't work that way.
[53:52.45]Keep walking.
[53:52.87]I can walk and be on the phone.
[53:54.25]Alright.
[54:21.02]So I gotta get up there.
[54:21.74]Ooh, chest.
[54:25.30]What is it?
[54:27.40]Plus one repair nano paste.
[54:32.73]Good thing I didn't just sprint through.
[54:33.83]What about anything in the... Can I open the boxes?
[54:37.47]Oh shit, you can.
[54:38.13]Is there anything in them?
[54:42.13]Everything can just be chopped up.
[54:45.93]Thank god I have a good CPU for this.
[54:49.77]Okay, uh, so I gotta get up there.
[54:54.02]No, wait, there's more boxes.
[54:55.38]No, that's just a couch.
[54:56.68]It's gonna be perfect right down the middle cut.
[55:00.78]Fuck, I didn't realize that was gonna happen.
[55:02.58]Raiden, if you ever get lost, use Augment Mode to check your next objective.
[55:07.71]See, now you can fit it through, wait, toggle AR.
[55:09.99]Now using Augment Mode, you can see enemy positions and the direction in which you should head.
[55:15.97]Useful for when you cannot find your objective on the Soliton radar.
[55:21.45]Hey, thanks.
[55:21.79]I probably would have been here for so long.
[55:27.47]Alright, I'll get another, uh, chest here.
[55:30.37]What's that?
[55:31.71]BP.
[55:34.23]I don't want to say it, but it's just so easy to say.
[55:36.29]B and then P, you know what I mean?
[55:38.33]From two days ago.
[55:39.56]Hostiles in the lower corridor, I see.
[55:41.88]Try to flank them, or approach from behind.
[55:45.06]I'm not doing it.
[55:45.68]I told you that I'm leaving that in 2018.
[55:48.67]Alright, let's get over here and do like the fun move where you jump down and then splash him.
[55:54.65]Nice.
[55:55.83]What's out here?
[56:03.19]Is it time?
[56:03.77]I'm gonna deflect rockets and shit.
[56:05.91]Is this stealth in this game?
[56:12.23]Your body analyzes radar and IR data to construct your AR display.
[56:17.43]Some civilians are still in the city.
[56:19.47]That is not good.
[56:21.78]When it flashes blue, use blade mode.
[56:23.88]Blade blue, blue, blue, blade, blade, blade, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[56:28.04]What are you doing here?
[56:29.08]This area is off limits.
[56:36.47]That guy's crouching too much.
[56:45.83]Ooh, nice try, almost got me.
[56:50.86]Can I parry the grenade?
[57:02.60]That guy's legs are hot.
[57:09.14]Alright, who's left?
[57:09.72]You?
[57:09.94]This guy's a little different.
[57:14.01]So... okay.
[57:15.69]Alright, whatever.
[57:17.99]Wasn't there a guy up here?
[57:21.61]Sans Eye.
[57:24.75]Restart.
[57:25.15]I killed a civilian.
[57:26.11]I did not... I did no such thing.
[57:29.06]Oh, it's one of the goat things.
[57:39.20]Is there like a dodge roll?
[57:40.14]I feel like there should be a name for this.
[58:14.31]Well that makes things a lot easier.
[58:22.40]That guy didn't even exist.
[58:31.96]That guy just flipped over into me and turned into nothing.
[58:49.08]Oh, I can't do it.
[58:51.00]What?
[58:51.98]What?
[58:53.12]Okay.
[58:53.28]What do I do?
[59:10.04]Did I miss something?
[59:10.90]No, I got him.
[59:20.02]Wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait.
[59:21.60]When they turn blue, I have to press left... Okay.
[59:26.84]I thought you... I thought you were talking about the blue up there when it was full or something.
[59:32.68]Blade mode when the symbol appears.
[59:36.04]Change sub-weapon.
[59:38.96]Uh.
[59:40.06]Recovery.
[59:42.95]Main.
[59:43.31]Okay, here's grenades.
[59:48.29]A small quantity of the substance found in Cyborg and UG self-repair units that can be used to immediately restore Raiden's life gauge.
[59:55.35]Okay, so it's a heal.
[59:58.07]And then this is a grenade.
[60:08.08]The latest in fragmentary grenades.
[60:10.84]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[60:12.80]I'll get the mouse off this.
[60:14.32]I just dropped the fucking mouse, hold on.
[60:17.58]Uh, larger and heavier than a conventional grenade requires cyborg-grade strength to throw it.
[60:21.28]Alright, so... LB is equipped.
[60:26.54]Oh, I'm holding it now.
[60:27.94]Okay, uh, throw it.
[60:30.05]Where is it?
[60:34.31]Well, great place to give me the tutorial for that.
[60:50.17]Okay, let's go.
[60:59.33]Oh, that was long!
[61:00.59]That was a long animation.
[61:01.75]Oh, fuck.
[61:09.34]Am I supposed to be fighting both these guys at the same time?
[61:27.93]Where the fuck did this guy come from?
[61:31.97]Oh my god, I'm like, getting my ass kicked here.
[61:34.95]I'm gonna like, die.
[61:45.30]Alright, I'm gonna do it!
[61:48.68]I'm gonna do it!
[61:49.83]What?
[61:50.45]Why is it not doing it?
[61:51.51]Did I have not enough power?
[61:56.55]What do I have behind me?
[61:58.47]I did hold it.
[62:03.07]Hold blade mode.
[62:04.23]That's what I was doing.
[62:04.93]Alright.
[62:21.66]Sometimes I'll do it.
[62:23.70]Sometimes I'll press, like, up and X. What the fuck is going on?
[62:29.70]I thought it was hold it!
[62:30.60]Hold it when he does this!
[62:31.56]He's blue!
[62:32.52]He's blue.
[62:33.40]This guy's blue right now.
[62:34.95]Alright?
[62:35.27]He's blue.
[62:40.09]Hold it when he's blue.
[62:42.01]What happened?
[62:45.23]The screen also has to be blue.
[62:49.47]Okay.
[62:49.59]Okay.
[62:56.49]I just don't... Everybody's screaming at me!
[63:08.21]Do the blade mode tutorial.
[63:11.76]Well, I haven't done that yet.
[63:13.04]Is that gonna... Is that happen soon?
[63:14.52]They haven't like, taught me this shit yet.
[63:20.47]We're picking up a wireless transmission near your position.
[63:25.77]From the frequency, most likely an enemy data terminal.
[63:29.19]Check it out.
[63:29.99]We may be able to salvage some intel.
[63:34.11]Oh, let me see.
[63:36.73]No, wrong.
[63:39.63]Is it under help?
[63:40.29]Alright, hold on a second.
[63:44.65]Light attack, launcher during light attack, strong attack.
[63:47.69]Yeah, yeah, flurry kick.
[63:52.95]Let me just see these for a second.
[63:55.67]Heal the drop.
[63:56.47]Y, slight pause, then X, Y. VR missions.
[64:01.69]Hold on, I know, I know.
[64:02.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[64:03.67]Um, no, no, no, I don't want to do this yet.
[64:18.40]Let me get to, like, the stopping point here.
[64:20.12]I feel like that's going to pull me out of the whole game.
[64:25.16]I don't know all this stuff.
[64:26.64]You know what I mean?
[64:28.17]How am I supposed to know all these things that I have not known?
[64:30.55]You missed the terminal?
[64:36.27]Oh, I'm busy looking over here!
[64:39.76]Telling people to do the thing that I didn't learn yet.
[65:02.99]Alright, I got this.
[65:03.63]I'm gonna learn the hard way.
[65:11.19]Well, how else would you do it?
[65:13.51]You need to figure it out.
[65:15.88]I can go and do that.
[65:16.72]I can do the VR thing if I really feel the need to.
[65:32.06]Interface prototype all autonomous UG's feature high-level onboard artificial intelligence and additional prototyping device enables verbal because the download You don't say
[65:47.76]Okay, then.
[65:48.78]What's the meaning of life?
[65:50.38]Why are we here?
[65:55.70]I timed that pretty good.
[65:57.48]I am here to kill you.
[66:06.11]Ow.
[66:08.17]My god, that hurts.
[66:09.37]That's it?
[66:10.91]Pretty simple thinking for such a mighty intellect.
[66:15.15]I may analyze orders, but I may not disobey them.
[66:19.13]Should I disobey a direct order, my memory would be wiped.
[66:23.37]I must destroy you.
[66:24.55]Is this the same actor doing the same conversation here?
[66:29.15]Your taunting is pointless.
[66:31.53]Exterminate.
[66:33.11]Let's see how badly I need to do the VR tutorial.
[66:36.59]We'll find out real quick.
[66:46.24]Who goes first?
[66:52.24]Probably shouldn't have done that.
[66:58.54]No!
[66:58.82]Target him!
[66:59.36]What?
[67:05.19]Whoa!
[67:22.09]Get up here.
[67:22.69]Can I get up there too?
[67:24.71]What's he doing?
[67:25.09]What's that move?
[67:26.45]He did the blink.
[67:27.41]Could I... Oh, he held in fucking adds.
[67:36.49]No, I didn't... Can I, like, parry the grenade?
[67:38.79]Let's do this away.
[67:49.72]Alright, where you at?
[67:50.72]Back down here.
[67:54.84]I will exterminate your consciousness.
[68:04.89]And ready.
[68:05.95]Here we go.
[68:07.13]Get him!
[68:11.95]That didn't work.
[68:13.06]That didn't work.
[68:13.64]I thought I could do something there.
[68:21.18]I really thought that was gonna work.
[68:32.47]Do it!
[68:41.41]Do it again!
[69:01.94]Stop doing that.
[69:05.13]What the hell is going on?
[69:05.95]Turn that off.
[69:16.29]I'm trying to... Alright, I'm getting confused with the animations here.
[69:19.18]Because sometimes I'll do up and X. I must have to not be moving, right?
[69:25.98]Because sometimes I'll do it and he won't parry.
[69:32.61]Alright, I... I held it.
[69:37.45]I swear to god I did.
[69:39.78]I promise you.
[69:59.06]Where is he?
[69:59.38]Where the fuck is he?
[69:59.92]Where'd he go?
[70:21.00]Did I not get it?
[70:21.52]Are you sure about that?
[70:31.26]I did it!
[70:37.72]Okay, we're good.
[70:45.86]So what was the difference between that and the last one?
[70:47.89]I held it.
[70:53.58]I got it.
[70:57.72]The next time I do that, I'm gonna just hit him once in the toe.
[71:00.86]See if I can kill people like that.
[71:06.03]I got a C for that one, but it's alright.
[71:07.49]Don't worry.
[71:10.59]Alright, Subweapon Tutorial is now playable.
[71:13.01]Alright, here we go.
[71:15.69]Let me just do them now.
[71:17.93]Wait, is that... Am I at a checkpoint?
[71:19.62]I am, right?
[71:25.42]How does one change?
[71:30.25]Hold on.
[71:32.47]How do you, uh... Oh, alright.
[71:34.51]Well, I just took it, apparently.
[71:37.37]I thought I had to change it.
[71:38.29]Apparently something over here.
[71:46.56]Can I get in there?
[71:51.08]Have you not played Bane?
[71:52.20]I've never played Bane.
[71:53.14]No?
[71:56.53]Hello, Chip.
[72:01.95]Alright, let's go.
[72:05.51]Play that next.
[72:07.81]Maybe.
[72:10.89]Is there a stealth?
[72:20.73]Perfect parry.
[72:21.29]Here we go.
[72:21.85]One.
[72:22.57]Two.
[72:23.81]Come on, now.
[72:25.57]I wanna perfect parry you, dude.
[72:27.07]Let's go.
[72:29.81]Okay, I'm not even gonna perfect parry you.
[72:31.05]What's the point?
[72:31.73]Just kill him.
[72:45.87]Plague Devil May Cry?
[72:46.75]Isn't a new one coming out soon?
[72:50.16]Any more secrets?
[72:51.80]Secret!
[72:53.26]Got it.
[73:01.46]Just run like a baby.
[73:06.14]Oh, speaking of running.
[73:16.26]That easily he's dead.
[73:17.42]He's just gone.
[73:18.68]It's that easy.
[73:21.25]No screams.
[73:22.87]No big dramatic finish.
[73:24.35]No, he just fell off the bridge.
[73:32.88]I just got stuck on the environment.
[73:35.62]I got stuck on the lip of the bridge.
[73:38.24]How did I get stuck on that?
[73:44.94]Same spot.
[74:03.00]Do the tutorial on the bridge.
[74:09.28]Oh, I guess we keep going.
[74:14.50]Oh my god.
[74:16.67]Oh no, we have to do this again.
[74:24.07]Fuck, this is gonna be the hardest thing I can do in this game.
[74:26.97]Is run the bridge.
[74:38.74]Alright, so seriously, what is the problem here?
[74:46.98]Stop jumping, it makes you slow.
[74:49.48]I didn't jump once.
[74:53.33]Half of you guys are saying jump, and the other half is saying don't jump.
[74:58.15]Which one is it?
[75:13.52]See, I'm gonna run.
[75:14.50]I wasn't ready to run last time.
[75:20.28]Did I lose?
[75:20.60]Is this bridge?
[75:22.38]Am I done with the bridge?
[75:25.02]Oh lord.
[75:31.53]Well.
[75:33.71]Okay.
[75:34.03]Come on, do it again.
[75:37.89]What the fuck?
[75:38.37]That was weird.
[75:42.83]Maybe I have to get up closer?
[75:50.47]Uh, kind of.
[75:51.29]Maybe.
[75:51.55]Alright, the lock-on is fucking my brain here.
[75:55.08]Let's get up here.
[75:59.06]Don't eat them.
[75:59.78]Don't eat them.
[76:06.04]Well, that was... Okay.
[76:09.78]It blinked.
[76:10.70]Is it blinking?
[76:11.28]Is it shooting the... Alright.
[76:15.50]What?
[76:20.80]Where'd he go?
[76:25.64]Okay.
[76:28.17]That's what I was trying to do.
[76:29.57]I'm just going to stay down here.
[76:33.81]What's the point of going up?
[76:38.18]Uh... Well, there's this on the ground.
[76:47.90]Do I have that, like, equipped now as a sub-weapon?
[76:54.30]Okay.
[77:00.30]Interesting.
[77:10.08]Well, I guess that's... you just have to shoot him with the... I get it.
[77:13.03]Sounds fun.
[77:13.99]Fun!
[77:14.21]Is there another one?
[77:17.77]I got another one of those, right?
[77:18.67]Somewhere?
[77:18.95]Is there another one of those rocket launchers?
[77:33.94]There is.
[77:41.48]Alright, I need to get hit, like, one more time.
[77:47.30]I'm gonna run up them.
[77:50.60]Now you can't fly, dick.
[78:00.73]We're conveniently placed rocket launchers, yeah.
[78:02.81]Apparently.
[78:03.29]Alright.
[78:06.29]Now I'm gonna do the tutorial.
[78:12.46]I'm at the checkpoint.
[78:13.48]Head to the indicated waypoint.
[78:14.91]Alright, let's go.
[78:15.51]VR machine.
[78:25.95]Alright, so this is... I already did these.
[78:31.26]This is new.
[78:34.82]Turn on the lights.
[78:36.10]Alright.
[78:37.78]So this is... I don't know what I just pressed.
[78:48.75]Your body comes equipped with a technique we call Blade Mode.
[78:52.51]Let's begin by assuming the fighting position.
[78:56.47]Alright, fighting position.
[78:57.43]Sure.
[78:58.25]Now use Blade Mode to strike all of the targets.
[79:03.03]Okay.
[79:15.36]Right.
[79:19.84]Now remember, Blade Mode exacts a heavy toll on your fuel cells.
[79:24.39]Replenish your energy by attacking enemies.
[79:27.19]Your blade will absorb their electrolytes automatically.
[79:30.65]Try restoring your fuel cells back to maximum now.
[79:34.32]Standard cyborgs you can dismember immediately, no problem.
[79:37.96]Other foes will not fall so easily.
[79:40.36]You will first need to attack and damage them to some degree.
[79:43.92]Powerade.
[79:46.02]So you get it back by damaging people.
[79:49.93]Makes perfect sense.
[79:56.39]Cool.
[79:59.81]Doctor, I need to get the blade.
[80:01.15]Stab and grab.
[80:03.53]Stab and grab, as some call it.
[80:08.55]Activate blade mode with full fuel cells and you will automatically analyze the ideal cutting position.
[80:14.83]Execute it successfully and you will seize your full self-repair unit and restore some of your vitality.
[80:21.24]Now try it for yourself.
[80:23.10]Take the enemy's repair unit before he falls.
[80:28.82]That's what the square is for.
[80:40.04]Oh, okay.
[80:41.22]I understand that.
[80:42.44]Alright, okay.
[80:43.32]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[80:44.85]You have to hit the square.
[80:46.19]You have to slice through the square.
[80:48.55]That's how you get that.
[80:49.39]I understand.
[80:51.69]Did you not know already?
[80:52.39]Well, we've only seen it like three times.
[80:54.61]I've only seen that square like three times.
[81:09.03]Come on!
[81:21.19]Finally, a word about your enhanced AR.
[81:24.10]Enhanced AR adds several layers of information to your augmented reality vision.
[81:29.26]Use it for additional intel on your enemies or to see new aspects of your surroundings.
[81:34.06]Just remember, enhanced AR is automatically disabled as soon as you attack.
[81:41.26]yeah head to the waypoint you can see me through walls alright he's not even doing this all I need to know is the square thing now that makes a whole lot of sense you have to cut it right
[82:10.40]He just leaves, I just... Alright, this is... You will no doubt come across several different weapons in your missions.
[82:28.99]Best we went over their basic use.
[82:32.03]Pick up the rocket launcher in front of you.
[82:33.80]No, I did just- I did just figure this out, though.
[82:38.08]You can equip any weapons you acquire by selecting them in the sub-weapons screen.
[82:43.34]Of course, sub-weapons have a limited number of uses, you know.
[82:47.71]In this tutorial, it has unlimited ammunition, but do not expect this out on the field.
[82:53.75]You will want to save them for just the right time, I suspect.
[82:56.99]You can hipfire?
[82:57.93]Try all the sub-weapons you come across.
[83:00.23]You'll find that each has its own unique properties.
[83:03.87]Now, use these weapons to reach the goal point.
[83:11.15]Yeah, change sub weapon, there it is.
[83:21.02]I just accidentally... my fucking finger.
[83:25.68]Console aim, by the way.
[83:27.06]Alright, that was fun.
[83:49.09]Do a rocket jump.
[83:53.05]You can't do rocket jumps.
[83:54.35]What are you... You can't do that!
[83:56.57]Right in the head.
[84:12.04]Is there a way I can quick switch weapons like that?
[84:14.70]Or do I have to go in the venue every time?
[84:21.47]Alright, almost done.
[84:26.43]Just use the D-pad.
[84:27.49]I mean, that's what I'm doing.
[84:28.17]Okay, right on the D-pad opens this menu.
[84:31.49]Left on the D-pad opens the menu.
[84:32.87]Down on the D-pad.
[84:33.77]Up on the D-pad does that.
[84:36.39]And half the menu, okay.
[84:48.81]I mean, it's not my fault that this guy's on a little cube, okay?
[84:53.11]He's on a cube!
[84:54.15]How am I supposed to get that guy when he's on a cube?
[85:18.61]Okay, I'm serious.
[85:22.27]I guarantee you didn't do that.
[85:23.93]I guarantee you did this tutorial and you did the same fucking thing.
[85:27.07]I guarantee it.
[85:28.51]Okay, that's a 100% guarantee.
[85:29.30]I 100% guarantee that.
[85:29.94]Now I get the square thing, I'm ready to go.
[85:52.03]Sub-weapons suck anyways in this game.
[85:53.70]Alright, well that's good to know.
[85:58.26]Joke's on you, I didn't do the tutorial.
[86:00.10]Alright, I'm ready.
[86:06.84]Customize.
[86:08.10]No!
[86:16.69]That poor guy!
[86:17.93]That's not what I wanted to have happen!
[86:19.99]God damn it!
[86:28.82]CUT IT!
[86:29.26]CUT THE THING!
[86:30.60]Got it.
[86:44.23]No, get it!
[86:44.93]Got it!
[86:51.38]What the fuck are you?
[86:59.72]Oops.
[87:00.52]Holy shit, squards.
[87:04.13]10 community subs from squards.
[87:08.83]Holy shit, thank you.
[87:12.27]That's a lot.
[87:17.90]10 community subs.
[87:18.62]See, I get it.
[87:20.08]I understand.
[87:21.54]Sometimes it takes a minute to figure out what you're doing.
[87:26.12]Like, I don't have like an implant in my brain where I download a game and know exactly how to do everything.
[87:32.09]It takes a tutorial- Like, look, it's- Give me a little bit of a break!
[87:39.04]Perhaps you could find a cyborg with access and, uh, borrow it?
[87:43.58]You see any cyborgs around here, Doc?
[87:45.69]Why not double back?
[87:46.68]Check the vehicle route again.
[87:48.18]You know, back at the entrance to the old city.
[87:49.48]You're breaking down?
[87:49.96]No, I'm fine.
[87:50.72]Who knows?
[87:51.66]Maybe you can hitch a ride.
[87:53.28]Most likely, platoon commanders carry correct ID data for the gate.
[87:57.28]Use enhanced mode to figure out who to hit.
[87:59.67]Alright, we're going to find somebody that has the data.
[88:03.03]This guy does, apparently.
[88:05.57]Oh, there's a bunch of people in there.
[88:17.61]How do you guys not know I'm here?
[88:20.51]No, no, no, no, no, I didn't get it.
[88:23.19]I missed it.
[88:30.66]Oh, I don't have enough.
[88:31.30]Okay, whatever.
[88:36.60]That, like, little chunk of his body.
[88:38.30]Fuck.
[88:39.56]Wait, somebody has the DNA.
[88:41.31]That guy.
[88:53.31]I cut all around it.
[88:54.39]Alright, where are you?
[88:59.85]What?
[89:00.01]Hold on, what?
[89:00.29]What do you mean I missed them all?
[89:15.79]What was I supposed... What was I... What did I do wrong?
[89:19.49]Oh, their hands.
[89:20.65]Oh, I needed to bring their hand back.
[89:25.19]I was supposed to cut that guy's arm off.
[89:27.59]And bring it back here.
[89:30.13]Wow, man, you missed him.
[89:31.67]Oh, holy shit.
[89:35.09]Really, am I not close enough?
[89:36.17]Oh, really?
[89:40.35]You missed him.
[89:41.35]Oh!
[89:41.97]That's never happened before.
[89:44.71]I'm actually pretty surprised that's even possible.
[89:47.55]Just early into the game.
[89:53.83]Where are you?
[90:04.57]Come here.
[90:14.85]Now you... How do I get up there?
[90:16.17]Can I climb up there?
[90:16.98]I'm just gonna have to shoot you with the rocket launcher, I guess.
[90:34.11]Nope, can't get it.
[90:39.65]Wait, what?
[90:40.86]Oh, okay.
[90:41.16]I just plucked that.
[90:53.97]No, I didn't get it.
[90:56.59]I gotta be quick with that.
[91:07.35]You dead?
[91:08.09]Good.
[91:13.81]I need to get a left arm.
[91:16.45]I don't want a left arm.
[91:24.37]If you cut all of someone's limbs off, they still try to come after you.
[91:27.51]Really?
[91:29.83]That's kind of crazy.
[91:33.97]Alright, I got heals.
[91:42.40]What else we got?
[91:45.68]3D photo frame.
[91:46.68]What the hell does that do?
[91:56.89]Come on, get up there.
[92:00.49]It's lore, ooh!
[92:02.77]Lore, everybody loves lore, don't they?
[92:06.13]Uh, what's this?
[92:26.50]I need something to drink.
[92:43.64]What do I have?
[92:45.64]Snipe him!
[92:46.18]Snipe him!
[92:46.58]Take the shot!
[92:47.76]Take the shot!
[92:48.36]You have it right there!
[92:49.02]Snipe him!
[92:51.90]Unbelievable.
[93:00.77]I'm a proponent of if you... Just don't even wear the jacket.
[93:04.57]You know, why do you have it just on your back like that?
[93:06.59]Ah, text from... text from Dad!
[93:17.04]New voicemail from Dad.
[93:27.70]Alright, I'm heading for the refinery.
[93:44.03]Good job parrying those cooties.
[93:45.73]Alright, hold on just a second.
[93:55.40]What do I got?
[93:55.82]I got some parts I can put into my body.
[94:03.12]Body.
[94:03.52]New, new, new, new.
[94:04.88]Alright, custom body.
[94:08.85]Custom body.
[94:09.67]Original body.
[94:11.71]Gray fox.
[94:13.91]White armor.
[94:14.65]Inferno armor.
[94:16.95]Unpurchased.
[94:17.51]Alright, I have 35,000 BP.
[94:21.84]So why would I buy one of these skins?
[94:23.32]Did I do anything?
[94:27.81]Gray Fox!
[94:28.31]Gray Fox!
[94:28.83]Gray Fox!
[94:30.89]Functionally equivalent to recent science, though it was terminated as an exoskeleton.
[94:34.59]In these days, where they have it in modern cybernetic technology, it could have been taken.
[94:38.27]So why would I do this?
[94:39.02]It's just cosmetic.
[94:41.40]Don't I want to make sure I save my money to buy, like, new weapons?
[94:46.50]Oh, I only got one?
[94:47.36]Wow, okay.
[94:47.96]Well, that's 200,000.
[94:48.42]Like... It's attack power, energy use, special effect...
[94:59.33]Life.
[95:01.63]I got an enhancement here.
[95:02.61]Enhance upgrade.
[95:03.63]An updated version of Raiden's cyborg body firmware that immediately reshapes his artificial muscular whenever he's hit, reducing the amount of damage taken.
[95:12.40]Wow, I want that.
[95:13.38]Endurance plus one.
[95:21.55]This is 8,000.
[95:22.39]Fuel Cell.
[95:22.83]An updated version of Raiden's cyborg body firmware.
[95:26.24]Optimizes power usage.
[95:27.42]Represented in the air.
[95:28.14]Display as extended fuel cell.
[95:30.38]Uh, yeah.
[95:33.16]Skills.
[95:35.70]Aerial Parry.
[95:38.84]That improves balance when airborne.
[95:40.10]Enabling to parry enemy attacks in mid-air.
[95:42.24]Uh, okay.
[95:43.60]Thank you.
[95:46.52]faster, more detailed feedback to be delivered to his brain synapses.
[95:49.70]This detailed neural feedback allows Raiden to freely sidestep enemy attacks in any direction and counter their aggression.
[95:57.42]Yeah?
[95:58.56]Sounds great.
[96:01.72]Improves reaction speed in his quadriceps, enabling a special upward thrust with his weapon held in his foot.
[96:08.41]That's a dodge roll?
[96:09.93]Thank god.
[96:13.39]Sweep, Kick, Thunderstrike, okay.
[96:17.73]What else do I got?
[96:23.03]That's it, right?
[96:24.75]Can I get some upgrades?
[96:32.79]Wait, you're gonna, you're gonna, wait, hold on.
[96:33.99]I can, you can do your current weapon?
[96:37.86]I don't have to just buy another one?
[96:38.88]Let me see.
[96:46.64]Main weapon... This is... Okay, zero equipment.
[96:52.77]Enhancements.
[96:55.03]Strength plus one.
[96:55.93]I mean, I can still... I can afford it.
[96:59.91]Moves become enabling to deal greater damage to enemies.
[97:03.91]Absorbs more electrolytes.
[97:05.79]Makes the fuel bar go up higher.
[97:08.74]I'm gonna say... Hmm.
[97:16.24]Let's just go with... I wanna... Yeah.
[97:19.02]Electrolytes.
[97:31.22]Big bits.
[97:32.84]Luckybone just gave $30.
[97:37.84]Uh, Luckybone, thank you for the $30.
[97:40.98]Funny story here.
[97:42.57]I accidentally purchased a shit-ton of bits completely by accident.
[97:46.17]You're my favorite human being, so here you go.
[97:48.29]Not much.
[97:48.91]What do you mean, not much?
[97:52.57]Not much.
[97:56.20]That's a fucking $30.
[97:57.76]Alright, so that's the dodge.
[98:02.26]It's A and X at the same time in a direction.
[98:04.42]Can I do it backwards?
[98:05.25]I can't.
[98:05.47]Can I do it forwards?
[98:06.65]No.
[98:07.27]So you can do side to side.
[98:13.46]Alright, cool.
[98:16.12]That's 30 bucks.
[98:16.98]That's not... Oh, that's not much.
[98:19.89]Yes, it is.
[98:21.23]Thanks for even fucking considering.
[98:22.67]Thank you.
[98:22.97]Alright, we got... Here we go.
[98:26.12]I'm not gonna miss it this time.
[98:38.29]I mean, is there another way I can, like, do this?
[98:40.49]Could I just... I mean, I guess.
[98:51.33]Thanks for the bits.
[98:52.07]Yeah, no, thank you.
[98:52.87]I don't have the rocket.
[98:58.08]Greedy streamer demands more... What?
[99:01.28]I said don't say that $30 is not much because it's a lot.
[99:05.30]Fuck.
[99:10.98]Oh, I forgot, someone's gonna unsub if I didn't cut somebody's hand off.
[99:13.36]Okay, I'll get it.
[99:24.06]That's very useful.
[99:25.22]Oh, fuck, there's a lot of people here.
[99:35.06]I, like, alerted the whole horde here.
[99:44.89]Whoa, how did you grab me?
[99:47.70]What?
[99:48.06]How did he get me like that?
[99:59.46]Harry, I gotta like... Got it, okay.
[100:19.03]What?
[100:19.51]Okay, I don't know why that keeps happening.
[100:21.43]I swear to God, I'm pressing it.
[100:22.65]I'm pressing the button with, right?
[100:24.73]Like, I don't know what's going on here.
[100:27.15]Am I doing it too early or something?
[100:30.65]I don't get it.
[100:31.03]Because every time I press it, it seems to just not work.
[100:36.51]It just takes it off.
[100:40.70]Pressing it too early.
[100:41.50]I guess so.
[101:02.25]Shit, come here.
[101:04.31]No!
[101:09.02]Where is it?
[101:09.50]It's up there.
[101:09.96]Here we go, I'm gonna try it again.
[101:24.59]Oh, I didn't do that.
[101:41.12]I was just trying to go that way.
[101:42.06]You wouldn't let me go!
[101:42.74]Wait.
[101:45.50]What's over here?
[101:46.46]Oh, I didn't get the hand.
[101:53.24]Oops.
[101:54.80]You're right.
[101:55.28]We've intercepted call for backup during your last fight.
[101:57.93]The caller's position is on your soliton radar.
[102:00.97]You can engage if you wish.
[102:02.71]It is your choice.
[102:05.09]Minus one self.
[102:06.15]I'll get a hand, don't worry.
[102:08.13]Well, now, what's this, like, optional thing it wants me to do?
[102:10.18]Hold on, let me just see.
[102:11.14]I'll do it.
[102:11.76]Why not?
[102:14.78]I'm assuming this is, like, side mission content?
[102:16.70]Side stuff?
[102:20.63]Oh, great.
[102:23.09]Oh, this is fantastic.
[102:24.79]Now I wish I didn't do this.
[102:42.32]Take it off!
[102:43.08]Take it down!
[102:55.74]Shoot it!
[102:59.30]Can't run up those, can I?
[103:00.48]Can I jump on those?
[103:04.86]Ah, no.
[103:16.00]Take it off!
[103:16.62]No, you know what I was trying to say.
[103:18.01]At least they're low enough where I don't have to shoot into rockets.
[103:44.94]Why are they flying so low?
[103:45.96]Yeah, they could be so much higher up.
[103:49.95]Alright, you're out.
[103:58.77]What'd I get?
[103:59.19]I got a... Is it a bed?
[104:06.35]I got a bed.
[104:09.07]Okay.
[104:10.51]What's a bed mean?
[104:19.28]B-E-D.
[104:19.93]Bed.
[104:20.43]Hello?
[104:24.57]The cliff is just ahead at the end of the old city.
[104:27.45]Beyond that is the refinery's backyard.
[104:30.21]So what?
[104:30.91]It's a sheer droplet?
[104:32.09]The refinery's not connected to the city at all?
[104:35.20]No.
[104:35.78]It was only built two years ago.
[104:37.80]There should be a narrow path around there that leads to the plant.
[104:41.00]It is protected by a fence, but probably you can cut your way through.
[104:45.16]Probably.
[104:47.07]I don't know why.
[104:50.19]I was about to just scream, shut up, Boris, as loud as I could.
[104:54.01]That would have been really bad.
[104:55.51]I'm so glad I just suppressed the... I'm glad I didn't do that.
[105:01.88]I was going to scream it.
[105:04.36]Like, I'm 33.
[105:04.64]You don't do that anymore, you know what I mean?
[105:12.31]Can I get in here?
[105:13.33]What the fuck?
[105:14.77]I'm like a six billion dollar ninja and I can't go through a chain link fence.
[105:18.49]Come on.
[105:19.77]Uh-oh.
[105:33.84]Got it.
[105:34.58]No, I didn't.
[105:35.32]Damn it.
[105:38.00]Watch out.
[105:38.94]They keep on coming.
[105:55.86]Who's next?
[106:00.89]Fuck.
[106:01.57]Oh shit, they're like grabbing my head.
[106:20.99]Don't think, uh, the dodge roll, I'm actually, I don't like doing it.
[106:23.91]I don't like how I press X and A at the same time, it's a little odd.
[106:26.15]Alright, let me make sure I don't miss any secrets.
[106:36.94]Secret up there.
[106:40.40]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, you're gonna miss the secret!
[106:42.20]Jerma!
[106:44.44]I got it, I got it, calm down.
[106:54.20]Maybe I missed it.
[107:00.05]2.1 million.
[107:01.57]I'm just missing shrapnel.
[107:08.35]That's not good.
[107:09.23]Should I really get stuck inside of them?
[107:18.95]Didn't get seen.
[107:19.61]Watch this.
[107:20.05]Ready?
[107:20.57]One, two, three.
[107:28.14]Didn't even see me.
[107:30.42]No alert.
[107:31.18]Wait.
[107:31.78]Sequence.
[107:40.21]Why do they put that shit in games anymore?
[107:41.39]You know what I mean?
[107:51.57]They do have a dumper, but... I tried to block it.
[108:12.68]Okay, the thing is... That thing is shooting me.
[108:14.54]You gotta go.
[108:24.24]What am I even looking for?
[108:24.94]Who's on me?
[108:25.50]This one of these little frogs is on me.
[108:36.15]Can I not block that?
[108:43.61]Damn it!
[108:44.95]I tried.
[108:48.20]This stupid thing.
[108:48.80]I can't even target this thing.
[109:06.80]Liar, liar.
[109:08.30]What do you mean, liar?
[109:09.10]He's so selective.
[109:09.86]Wait.
[109:10.44]There are active IR sensors in the area.
[109:12.82]Part of factory security, no doubt.
[109:14.62]But the enemy may be using it.
[109:21.58]What?
[109:22.26]Whoops.
[109:37.36]Oh well.
[109:43.06]Is there a way I can reliably kill these things?
[109:45.56]Besides, like, jumping and having to splash blindly?
[109:56.35]I'm, like, pausing.
[109:57.57]I don't understand.
[110:00.43]Just have to run past them.
[110:05.29]Why would I do that?
[110:09.73]Alright, run!
[110:11.65]Pick up all the stuff on the ground though.
[110:19.99]Alright, what do I do with this guy over there?
[110:34.70]What do we got?
[110:35.82]We got a bunch of people up there.
[110:38.63]I gotta get up top.
[110:40.39]No secrets.
[110:41.07]Yeah, there is one here.
[110:42.25]Alright.
[110:49.09]Jam grenade!
[110:50.41]Hold on just a second here.
[110:58.24]Amidst electromagnetic pulses for a limited time, disabling any UGs and cyborgs in the area.
[111:02.06]Okay.
[111:04.84]Uh, so I'm gonna get up there, and then I'm gonna throw this.
[111:10.00]You know what I'm saying?
[111:16.31]Gonna whip it up there.
[111:16.99]3... 2... 1... Disable!
[111:19.58]Go!
[111:52.06]Get me up.
[111:52.70]Get me up here.
[111:53.92]Why can I not get up there?
[111:54.94]Can I get two?
[112:04.31]I can do two.
[112:07.19]Nice.
[112:07.29]Alright, that's cool.
[112:08.09]Left hand.
[112:08.81]Got it.
[112:09.21]You can resubscribe now.
[112:25.91]I'm gonna get this.
[112:26.61]There's some, like, treasure chests over here and stuff.
[112:28.41]Hold on.
[112:30.82]Where's that one?
[112:31.44]It's across the way.
[112:33.12]I'm gonna run past this, but it don't matter.
[112:37.36]I'll just run by it.
[112:38.12]Who cares?
[112:38.56]What do you got?
[112:45.55]Ooh.
[112:46.47]Got the jam grenade.
[112:48.59]There's something else over here, right?
[112:49.67]What is that?
[112:52.01]Key card?
[112:55.14]What the hell?
[112:55.78]Data storage 1 out of 20.
[112:56.94]What the hell does that mean?
[113:03.22]La-le-lu-le-lo.
[113:03.86]How fast do you think I can say la-le-lu-le-lo?
[113:11.02]La-le-lu-le-lo.
[113:13.00]La-le-lu-le-lo.
[113:13.98]La-le-lu-le-lo.
[113:14.72]La-le-lu-le-lo.
[113:16.68]That's pretty fucking fast.
[113:26.42]Just got to get up top.
[113:28.71]There's one person up there.
[113:35.73]Can I make it up there?
[113:38.29]Is it going to kill me if I jump?
[113:42.76]That's just you fall and you die.
[113:44.46]Game over.
[113:44.88]I got to go this way.
[113:49.46]So now I should be able to go from here to there.
[113:52.76]Can I make this jump?
[113:58.44]The game is protecting me from falling off so Cinematically you fucking idiot Huh Fancy seeing you up here god fucking dammit dammit
[114:25.78]I didn't think they had clowned tickets up here.
[114:29.32]That was even worse.
[114:30.36]Hey!
[114:30.92]Cutscene.
[114:35.14]I was wondering when you'd come, Jack the Ripper.
[114:39.27]No one calls me that anymore.
[114:41.31]Dol Sayev, where is he?
[114:43.19]What?
[114:43.55]Why does his voice change?
[114:45.89]I can show you a better time than that, crusty old bear.
[114:49.93]You're in charge here.
[114:52.63]I am Mistral.
[114:55.87]And it is so hard to walk in these things.
[114:59.03]I am balancing on a spike.
[115:01.49]That was a long time ago.
[115:03.15]Hey, where are those clown tickets I was promised up here?
[115:06.90]L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L
[115:22.47]He looks right into the fucking camera and says that.
[115:24.31]Cut from the same cloth, you and I. You don't know me.
[115:28.32]I lost my whole family.
[115:30.92]Everything.
[115:33.60]Yeah, that was a real la-la-la-la moment on Jerma Street.
[115:37.10]But I butchered those fuckers.
[115:40.29]My family's killers.
[115:41.97]That's when I realized I am a killer too.
[115:45.87]And a good one at that.
[115:49.34]I slaughtered dozens in Iraq.
[115:51.87]In Afghanistan.
[115:53.09]I found my calling.
[115:55.82]You're proud of that, are you?
[115:58.69]What happened, happened.
[116:01.74]Air comes out.
[116:02.28]Yeah, but you sure do need a bunch of like eight or nine adds, huh?
[116:32.23]Can't just 1v1 me.
[116:35.09]Proving that you're not as good as me.
[116:38.34]I don't need four fucking frog enemies.
[116:42.64]She starts doing little waltz with it.
[116:55.54]Like a real comedic jokey waltz.
[117:01.12]I'm sorry.
[117:01.58]Let's go.
[117:01.92]What, she has a Darth Maul weapon?
[117:03.74]With hands?
[117:11.42]What the hell are they doing?
[117:13.02]What?
[117:38.50]hand step okay cool really cool out of here alright
[118:09.57]I'm trying to block you!
[118:18.20]Can we get these fucking aliens out of the way, please?
[118:21.76]She's dead, right?
[118:24.41]I just... I just exploded her whole body.
[118:27.47]I win.
[118:52.52]Can I block those?
[119:00.29]Oh wait, what's happening?
[119:03.69]What the hell is that?
[119:04.73]What is going on here?
[119:05.91]There wasn't anything.
[119:06.47]There was no indicator on the screen.
[119:09.67]Oh, I can do this!
[119:10.37]Okay, cut that rope she had on me.
[119:20.44]She's flying?
[119:22.50]Well, that was a long way.
[119:24.30]Mine was way cooler than yours.
[119:28.63]Where can I get one of those things, by the way?
[119:31.23]You know how useful that ship would be?
[119:46.87]I want to get away from this.
[119:48.88]I'm locked in the corner.
[119:55.24]What?
[119:55.50]What?
[120:01.31]Did you block that?
[120:15.80]We got no arms, lady.
[120:31.11]That was pathetically awful.
[120:32.57]Did you hear how bad that acting was?
[120:35.15]I'm talking about me.
[120:41.89]I was too focused on the game.
[120:47.59]Gotta get the little guys out of the way.
[120:57.47]Oh, you're causing a real problem, guys.
[121:17.14]He ain't gonna run from me.
[121:19.66]No, goddammit, I almost broke my controller.
[121:24.44]Can you hit somebody?
[121:49.74]Where?
[121:50.44]What the fuck was that?
[121:52.18]Alright, this camera is seriously, like, can you pick a fucking direction to be pointing?
[122:01.31]What the fuck?
[122:26.88]Am I supposed to tap something?
[122:30.44]Don't fuck with me.
[122:42.57]Oh she's being frozen!
[122:50.46]This is very anti-climactic.
[122:51.84]I only got, like, a pump for head.
[122:53.06]So why is that not happening to me?
[123:07.01]Sorry.
[123:10.55]I just killed someone.
[123:12.23]That's what will be happening right now.
[123:16.86]She's still talking now, so she's okay.
[123:50.63]The two won't go on.
[123:59.28]She'll never... She's not talking to you, idiot.
[124:02.06]You!
[124:09.48]He's gonna take the jacket off and he's gonna have rocket launchers on his shoulders and like a second person's gonna be on his back cybernetically or something.
[124:22.17]Shit.
[124:31.40]There's definitely another person attached to his back, all folded up like a spider.
[124:35.28]He's going to take the jacket off.
[124:36.56]The jacket's like a huge Chekhov's gun right now.
[124:38.95]You know what I mean?
[124:39.49]Like, it's just there.
[124:40.25]They keep showing it.
[124:42.71]Alright, let's see it.
[124:43.49]There, he pressed the button.
[124:57.97]Shoulder rockets misfired.
[125:00.31]What?
[125:01.25]No.
[125:01.43]No.
[125:22.08]Anybody want some more coffee?
[125:23.54]Yeah, sure.
[125:25.79]I'll take some.
[125:32.57]SBCB-ABAA.
[125:40.59]SBCB-ABAA.
[125:45.16]Total B.
[125:50.52]Hey, that's my password.
[125:54.04]Oh, I got the... the Lataranger.
[125:59.47]I know it's Latranger, okay?
[126:00.89]I know how to say that word.
[126:09.96]Alright, I need to get like some... I want to get some water.
[126:12.74]I'll be right back.
[126:14.16]It's only like 60-70% of the way through the game.
[126:16.56]Should be getting close, right?
[126:25.95]You know how to say it.
[126:26.79]That's even worse.
[126:27.47]What?
[126:29.88]That is even drinking again.
[126:31.06]No, I'm not.
[126:31.72]I'm drinking water and I had a little bit of coffee.
[126:34.88]I had some coffee earlier.
[126:36.64]Give me one second.
[126:39.08]I'm just going to grab... Because I want some water up here.
[126:42.07]I love BRB G2G.
[128:17.16]you
[129:17.53]Alright.
[129:18.65]Let's keep going.
[129:20.79]He got lost.
[129:21.43]Yeah, sometimes I get lost.
[129:24.45]I went downstairs.
[129:26.68]Looking around.
[129:27.24]I was like, what did I come down here for?
[129:31.80]Did I want to go to the bathroom?
[129:35.92]And then I sat on the couch.
[129:36.92]I just walked over to the couch and sat down.
[129:38.86]And I turned the TV on.
[129:41.13]I was like, I'm not watching.
[129:43.15]Am I watching what people put on the news?
[129:48.33]I put the news on for like 10 minutes.
[129:50.69]Alright, here we go.
[129:51.27]There's the, uh, the Latranger.
[129:56.45]Polearm.
[129:59.03]The user can wield it like a spear or relax the arm's tension level to use it like a whip.
[130:05.52]Hmm.
[130:08.74]10,000.
[130:08.76]Should I try it?
[130:13.66]Tide Pod.
[130:16.71]What do you mean, Tide Pod?
[130:19.01]Alright, because everybody wants me to do this.
[130:22.92]That's all I see in the chat.
[130:24.12]Everybody wants me to do this, so we're going to do this one instead.
[130:27.24]Wow, this is a hot cup of coffee.
[130:42.71]The large amount of cyborg healing and regeneration...
[130:46.55]I got it.
[130:46.91]Okay.
[130:48.11]Heals.
[130:50.48]Okay!
[130:52.00]Well, alright.
[130:55.70]Should I buy that weapon?
[130:56.66]No, I should upgrade my... The weapon I have... No.
[130:58.92]Alright, upgrade this again.
[131:02.16]Let's do the strength one.
[131:11.95]Get them both.
[131:19.76]What, I didn't equip it?
[131:20.52]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[131:24.70]I need to buy the polearm.
[131:26.74]Do I actually need to, though?
[131:34.91]Get the polearm, you have enough.
[131:36.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[131:38.43]It's cool.
[131:40.35]Not really, but it's cool.
[131:42.24]That's 10,000 bitpoints, though.
[131:48.30]Oh, fine, I'll get it.
[131:52.01]Well, now I have another... Well, I forgot about the skills.
[131:54.68]Shit.
[131:54.92]Okay.
[131:55.36]I don't have enough.
[131:56.36]I actually need to go look at how to do some of these.
[132:07.42]Let's try it.
[132:18.82]He fell for it.
[132:20.65]Enhance it?
[132:22.48]I don't think I want to though, because what if I don't like it?
[132:24.30]I'm just going to waste points on it.
[132:30.68]I'm seeing a lot of jebaited faces.
[132:33.58]So you've got some kind of disguise lined up, right?
[132:36.62]Yep, all set.
[132:38.55]Hope so.
[132:39.15]You'd be a little conspicuous just walking the streets.
[132:42.47]Relax, Kev.
[132:43.53]I'll blend right in.
[132:46.75]Yeah.
[132:48.19]Well, just get into the sewer system ASAP.
[132:52.57]Hopefully anyone who notices you will just mind their own business.
[132:55.35]You sure you want the K-9000 there along for this one?
[133:01.49]I had the good doctor make some adjustments along the repairs.
[133:04.64]This is the second ba- I am paying attention.
[133:06.84]I know, I look.
[133:09.96]So yeah, I say let's throw him a bone.
[133:13.54]Wordplay, my exoskeleton resembles a canine.
[133:17.28]Canines enjoy bones.
[133:18.92]He's our friend now?
[133:24.66]I told you to be nice to the animals.
[133:35.54]That's just the cat.
[133:37.28]That's the cat that its brain has been implanted into a cybernetic thing.
[133:44.42]PogChamp.
[133:58.50]I cannot wait for the inevitable when the dog goes.
[134:02.10]There's going to be some sarcastic comment where he goes, woof, woof.
[134:07.65]It's going to happen.
[134:08.73]Adios, amigos.
[134:13.01]Viste?
[134:14.03]Que raro, eh?
[134:14.79]Hay que hacer que no lo vimos.
[134:16.47]Vámonos ya.
[134:20.78]Because the whole time it's like, yo, you're a dog.
[134:22.54]But he's not a dog.
[134:24.20]And he's going to get really upset about it over the course of the game.
[134:27.52]Somebody makes a joke about, hey, your dog coming?
[134:29.56]And he's sarcastically going to go, woof, woof, I guess.
[134:32.29]...affiliated research center somewhere in that area.
[134:35.43]According to the intel from our client, the lab's been dumping illegal waste into those sewers.
[134:40.60]FYI, they're also involved with the cartels and human trafficking.
[134:45.14]Allegedly, anyway.
[134:46.56]Don't give me those ha-has right now.
[134:49.34]That was not me making a joke.
[134:51.30]This is the difference between a joke, reference, and prediction.
[134:58.82]So I'm looking for anywhere the lab might hook up with the sewers?
[135:02.35]Yep.
[135:03.19]If they're actually dumping waste, they've got to link up somehow.
[135:06.77]Find that connection, sneak into the lab, and see if you can find evidence implicating them on anything.
[135:12.26]No problem.
[135:13.38]Stealth's my specialty.
[135:15.04]Reference equals joke.
[135:16.97]Well, we'll see.
[135:18.77]Do we have any idea what kind of research they're doing there?
[135:22.39]Not really.
[135:23.55]That's not true.
[135:24.55]Maybe something related to all the people they're trafficking.
[135:27.33]Like experimentation?
[135:29.53]It's possible.
[135:30.91]First things first, though.
[135:32.49]Find a way into that lab.
[135:34.52]Oh, right.
[135:35.62]It says here the locals say black crocodiles live in those sewers.
[135:39.52]So, you know, watch out.
[135:43.23]Black crocodiles?
[135:45.59]Could they be talking about UGs?
[135:47.75]Maybe just an urban legend.
[135:49.61]But still, be careful.
[135:51.59]You said it was your New Year's resolution.
[135:53.98]Now, that was the joke.
[135:56.64]There's the joke.
[135:58.20]Commence operation.
[136:00.14]You know what I'm saying?
[136:02.42]Whoa.
[136:02.52]That just kind of went... We just... That was too fast.
[136:07.63]Okay, hold on a minute.
[136:17.60]Hmm, alright.
[136:20.00]That was a joke, because, you know, New Year's resolution.
[136:23.40]It's always, you never do it.
[136:25.08]You say you're going to do it, and you don't.
[136:26.49]So I'm not going to do it.
[136:27.47]That would get on daytime TV.
[136:31.97]If Twitch was on daytime TV, that would be daytime TV, twitch.tv, NBC joke.
[136:36.97]You know what I mean?
[136:39.09]Oh, well.
[136:46.81]I'm waiting for a parry moment right there.
[136:52.93]Uh, alright.
[136:54.29]I gotta get some perfect parries.
[137:04.47]Ah, fuck.
[137:05.27]Can you not parry those?
[137:06.13]You just dodge?
[137:13.87]I guess you just dodge them.
[137:16.45]Makes sense, doesn't it?
[137:22.96]Whoa, I thought he was dead.
[137:24.08]Apparently not.
[137:25.88]No!
[137:26.97]What's that?
[137:27.87]What is that?
[137:28.27]He just took shit out of an ice cube.
[137:30.33]Oh, no, no, wait, that's an item.
[137:31.79]Okay.
[137:44.81]I see a maintenance catwalk.
[137:46.65]Use it to conceal yourself if necessary.
[137:54.21]Nobody knows the lyrics to those.
[137:56.71]Everyone only knows that one part.
[137:58.08]Alright, so I need to get him.
[138:05.32]Everything but the place I need.
[138:07.68]Everything but the place.
[138:08.70]Everywhere but the one spot I needed to do that.
[138:11.10]I don't know how I didn't relax.
[138:14.21]In fact, I'm gonna get back up top.
[138:15.29]Alright, um... Easy here, come on.
[138:22.57]You can't get up there.
[138:23.45]Alright, what in the... What?
[138:26.64]I don't... I don't explain.
[138:29.14]Like... I'm getting, like, glitched into the boxes.
[138:31.98]Just get up there!
[138:42.05]That was so much more difficult than... And he's gone.
[138:48.48]Whatever.
[138:57.30]What?
[138:57.60]What was he gonna do it?
[139:03.98]Didn't get the arm?
[139:16.66]Oh, he does double pump.
[139:17.46]Oh, he didn't parry it.
[139:29.39]Okay.
[139:33.09]Backward swing, man.
[139:43.68]The guy has no arms!
[140:00.32]Should I heal?
[140:00.86]I'm not sure if I should even heal here.
[140:03.44]Recovery's down, right?
[140:12.14]Yeah.
[140:19.87]Don't you heal automatically?
[140:20.89]Um, I don't... Do you?
[140:22.89]If you do, I don't... Maybe I'm just too afraid to die.
[140:29.49]It's a jamming grenade, right?
[140:41.01]Did I just throw this?
[140:46.32]I think I'm just going to throw this.
[141:01.74]What a waste.
[141:04.80]Well, that's for me to deter.
[141:06.64]I think I need secondary items to win.
[141:10.02]A guy with no arms just almost killed me.
[141:12.73]I think I actually need items for this game.
[141:26.76]Wait.
[141:29.74]Nice.
[141:30.74]See, I got replaced.
[141:31.88]And plus, somebody told me that the items don't even matter in this game, guys.
[141:34.58]Somebody said secondary items.
[141:36.32]Bad.
[141:36.90]This is the new weapon, right?
[141:45.17]One guy said that, and they might be right.
[141:52.17]You guys seriously need to relax.
[141:54.27]Don't do it when you come and go to it.
[141:56.87]Relax, don't do it when you come around.
[142:01.30]What even are the lyrics to that song?
[142:21.36]Is that why everyone was just sparing that?
[142:27.76]Apparently.
[142:30.07]Okay.
[142:36.73]Oh, you're doing something, but I don't know what you're doing.
[142:38.63]Okay, the purple bad.
[142:40.09]Purple not good.
[142:55.47]Purple bad, purple bad!
[142:56.29]Fuck.
[143:10.32]Purple bad.
[143:14.33]Well, that was a lot slower than I thought it was.
[143:30.86]You're telling me I didn't get it?
[143:32.16]What am I not getting here?
[143:32.80]Now they're angry.
[143:41.76]They're angry, so I'm just going to do this.
[143:42.92]Oh, that guy's injured.
[144:03.74]No, that's not what I wanted.
[144:09.90]Shit.
[144:11.98]Oh my god.
[144:12.50]Did he just come out of there?
[144:20.27]Shit.
[144:33.65]He's still alive.
[144:35.47]Okay, I just kind of feel bad.
[144:41.14]He's just shooting his machine gun at me.
[144:45.16]I'll get you!
[144:46.44]I'll get you!
[144:49.11]Yeah, but like, you won't know.
[145:08.55]Hey.
[145:11.03]Dead on.
[145:15.03]Why is this coffee so hot?
[145:21.56]It's 1,000 degrees.
[145:23.96]What you say?
[145:25.34]Oh.
[145:26.08]We are Guyanese from Guyana.
[145:28.66]You speak English?
[145:31.68]Yeah, I'm from America.
[145:33.58]He is the lowest rank.
[145:34.78]That's not true.
[145:35.76]We saw a C already.
[145:38.08]George.
[145:40.74]And just like all damn America, president.
[145:44.21]Yeah.

[146:46.94]And got all they organ.

[146:57.75]Same as you.
[147:00.19]Me been strongest cyborg ever.
[147:02.27]Warlock all them phantoms in black clothes that I pass me.
[147:05.68]Starting to sound like a bad guy yourself.
[147:07.96]Just plain, nah?
[147:09.62]Me done plenty bad ting.

[147:22.25]Run your ass outta there.
[147:23.59]But them boy with me no understand.
[147:25.79]They like Spanish or something.
[147:27.73]So me the only one for escape.
[147:30.10]Then that machine come after me and... And I know the rest.
[147:35.92]George, I need every detail about how you escaped.
[147:40.65]George, please tell me.
[147:46.23]So the kid got into the sewers through a drainage channel?
[147:49.16]Yeah, he says the channel is super tight, but there's some kind of shutter next to it.
[147:54.17]Got it.
[147:54.77]George.
[147:55.23]That must be where they dumped the waste.
[147:57.35]George.
[147:57.59]There's something else.
[147:58.89]It sounds like a Desperado exec was on site yesterday.
[148:02.17]If a sentry cyborg was on hand for the meeting.
[148:04.66]You should be able to review their video log, provided you can find a server access terminal.
[148:09.36]I think it looks like he actually belongs in a different game.
[148:12.04]As well as a little peek at the level of that technology.
[148:14.98]That's a Resident Evil scientist.
[148:16.29]So what about the kid?
[148:17.70]I made sure the area was secure and told him to sit tight.
[148:20.86]Can you pick him up?
[148:22.19]Sure.
[148:22.77]I'll send a couple agents for him.
[148:24.55]You just focus on getting into that lab.
[148:27.03]If what he said is true about the organs, we need to hurry.
[148:31.11]Agreed.
[148:32.05]Riding out.
[148:32.57]Is this the right door?
[148:36.68]Yeah.
[148:37.80]Heavy UG activity ahead.
[148:39.90]It is possible they are conducting test operations while the lab is closed.
[148:44.10]They're not going to make it easy to get into that lab.
[148:47.01]Oh, what's that?
[148:52.19]The first time I've touched one of these computer data devices.
[148:58.60]Alright, I got it.
[149:01.82]Oh, man.
[149:02.64]Oh, man.
[149:03.54]Oh, man.
[149:04.40]Yeah.
[149:04.92]That's going to be so fun.
[149:07.18]I can't wait.
[149:08.76]Where is it?
[149:18.75]That could work, actually.
[149:22.75]Yeah.
[149:25.67]Well, you knew it was coming at some- Oh, okay.
[149:29.34]I thought I just lost it.
[149:31.66]So I have to- this is a sneak mission with the boss.
[150:08.13]He's the only one that has an issue with this.
[150:15.60]Oh, he got up here!
[150:21.72]No, go!
[150:27.06]No, wait!
[150:29.17]Oh god, they're all up here!
[150:31.71]I have to turn this on now, go!
[150:48.08]I just get... This is a bad place to fight all of you guys.
[151:03.76]No!
[151:06.32]God!
[151:07.06]He's running around in circles!
[151:19.85]Dammit, I didn't see him on screen.
[151:36.64]Fuck, I thought I got away from him.
[151:40.77]He broke my neck.
[151:54.39]How are you still alive?
[152:06.88]No more legs for you, get out of my way.
[152:20.79]I got the arm, good.
[152:23.54]Dammit, I tried to block it.
[152:28.91]Both of you, both of you, both of you, both of you, come on, break!
[152:53.84]Shit!
[152:57.69]I had it too.
[152:58.47]Yeah, I'll do it.
[152:59.33]Sure.
[152:59.61]This game's fun.
[153:00.27]This is a fun game.
[153:16.55]How are you still not getting it?
[153:17.63]Uh, I am.
[153:18.58]I know I have to hit the square, but if I had, like, a second to do it, I didn't get it.
[153:21.86]So, I have to fight this thing.
[153:27.48]Well, alright, I thought I had more than a second there.
[153:36.03]That's not blocked.
[153:43.17]Alright, hold on a second.
[153:44.26]I'm trying to parry that, but I'm just dashing forward into the fire.
[153:57.51]You can't block that.
[153:58.31]I can't do anything about that.
[153:59.31]I just have to deal with it.
[154:01.39]Dodge left or right.
[154:05.15]Well, I gotta keep going more than that.
[154:24.79]Take his brain out.
[154:25.87]Yeah, your brain's gone.
[154:27.15]Thanks for the brain.
[154:27.98]Oh shit, there's another one.
[154:38.40]Oh, I wanted to go the other way.
[154:39.42]Yeah, gone.
[154:47.95]Whoa, what the hell are you doing here?
[155:00.64]One more?
[155:03.00]Another one?
[155:03.62]These little guys.
[155:04.56]Ooh, there's two.
[155:08.82]Where?
[155:09.30]Where am I?
[155:10.18]Too many.
[155:10.80]Oh, God.
[155:29.82]I gotta get rid of one of these guys right now.
[155:38.98]Fuck!
[155:42.51]Too many!
[156:02.25]Feel the burn.
[156:04.53]That wouldn't be fair.
[156:06.29]I was doing my cutscene.
[156:18.44]I always miss it the first time.
[156:26.44]Done!
[156:31.26]What do I get for that?
[156:31.84]Plus thousand.
[156:34.40]Cool.
[156:38.04]Find a way into the research facility.
[156:39.48]I will.
[156:39.98]I already cleared the whole fucking area.
[156:42.86]Wait, I'm going the wrong way, aren't I?
[156:46.46]Am I going the wrong way right now?
[156:52.17]Lost four health packs equals A.
[156:58.36]Well, when they gave me two of those guys, the fire everywhere was panning out.
[157:02.52]There was a box I could open down here.
[157:04.16]Where is it?
[157:04.52]Did I already get it?
[157:07.06]I know there was something else.
[157:12.47]No.
[157:14.95]Maybe I'm just... There we go.
[157:15.81]It's up there.
[157:16.21]Did I already get it?
[157:26.97]I didn't get it okay.
[157:31.52]Really?
[157:42.16]What?
[157:42.42]Ah.
[157:57.35]Why can I not open this?
[158:02.95]Okay.
[158:04.43]Data storage.
[158:05.33]I got it.
[158:05.71]We gotta use sicko mode.
[158:22.96]Another box.
[158:23.68]Are these finite?
[158:24.60]It says one out of five.
[158:32.16]Who knows?
[158:32.48]That's a good point.
[158:39.75]That's a good point.
[158:40.89]Mod that guy!
[158:41.43]I'm just kidding.
[158:42.51]Alright, so...
[159:02.86]Combo lists.
[159:04.06]What did I get?
[159:04.46]Polearm.
[159:04.96]Okay, these are new.
[159:05.60]So let's see.
[159:07.14]Let's just Y. Y, Y. Y, Y, Y. Y, Y, Y, Y. Y, X. Y, X, Y. Y, Y, X. A lot of Y starts.
[159:19.39]Yeah, most of them are Y starts.
[159:21.00]Y, Y, X, Y. Oh my lord.
[159:24.04]Okay, Y, Y, Y, X, Y. Let's test that out.
[159:33.16]Y, Y, Y, X, Y. Okay.
[159:37.75]Let's test it on this guy.
[159:46.41]That was like three perfect carries.
[159:47.64]Give me a fucking break.
[160:04.62]Again, that was lined up correctly.
[160:06.44]It was.
[160:06.86]We got any treasures?
[160:14.43]Not that I can determine, but hold on a minute.
[160:20.23]That guy can't fit in here.
[160:22.93]No, we're fine.
[160:29.93]Well, I got a parry, but it wasn't perfect.
[160:37.05]Shit, I thought he was... I'm always afraid to do a full swinging animation because that could be... I always feel like I have to do one or two swings before giving up.
[161:02.36]What else is in here?
[161:08.85]What do you want from me?
[161:11.69]There's another guy in here.
[161:12.61]Hold on.
[161:12.91]Let me sneak attack this guy.
[161:13.95]I can stealth backstab kill this guy in one hit, right?
[161:17.11]Watch this, ready?
[161:33.22]Oh, I could have done something!
[161:34.38]I actually could have done that!
[161:37.30]Damn, I really didn't think you could actually do something like that.
[161:42.76]I was just making a joke, but you actually can do that.
[161:54.19]Are you gonna breathe fire too?
[162:06.54]This is a smooth experience.
[162:08.25]What does this game have on Metacritic?
[162:10.47]61?
[162:11.27]That's unfair.
[162:23.09]Camera, please.
[162:33.94]Yeah, the enemies are spawning still.
[162:35.78]This is farming experience points.
[162:44.54]So where am I supposed to go?
[162:45.42]I need to find a way to get out of here?
[162:49.18]I mean, there's this way.
[162:58.31]Can I go over?
[162:58.65]I mean, this is going to take me back around, isn't it?
[163:04.62]I was already in here.
[163:10.02]Can I get up there?
[163:13.12]It took you long enough.
[163:14.65]Thanks a lot.
[163:22.13]Play Metal Gear Survive?
[163:23.75]Oh no, I don't think so.
[163:25.57]I don't think so.
[163:31.56]I took too long?
[163:32.50]Don't give me that.
[163:34.81]It was scripted.
[163:37.11]Alright, one, two... Can I forklift people?
[163:57.39]Is there like a forklift item that you can... I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about, so let's just play.
[164:18.48]Is this some kind of forklift thing?
[164:21.47]When am I going to play Metal Gear Rising?
[164:23.29]Probably next week.
[164:25.47]And something I can use to access the lab's main server?
[164:30.52]Perhaps.
[164:41.58]You know, I thought there were two games that were in this series.
[164:45.89]I thought it was Metal Gear Rising, and then I thought there was Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
[164:51.05]I thought there were two games.
[164:56.95]I'll see what I can come up with.
[164:58.91]How do I use it?
[165:00.19]Simply connect to it.
[165:01.73]You should be able to use your communications outlay to control the proxy UG.
[165:05.93]I missed something over here.
[165:07.57]Hold on, there was like a funny joke that I missed.
[165:13.18]Did something happen out of that window?
[165:14.44]I missed... I... I... I do?
[165:20.05]What?
[165:26.89]Don't talk about the cutscenes.
[165:32.55]Well, that's the only chance that I have to be able to speak, because my brain has to turn off when I fight enemies.
[165:56.92]Short attention span.
[165:58.31]Well... Nobody saw that?
[166:01.91]Okay, well... You guys thought I had tunnel vision.
[166:20.25]How do I do a stealth takedown?
[166:27.87]No!
[166:33.27]How do you do a stealth takedown?
[166:35.21]Can I see something here?
[166:40.59]Where'd he go?
[166:41.73]There's a- there's some- that guy bounced.
[166:43.49]It's because he bounced, gotta- Walk up behind him, press B?
[166:47.68]That didn't work.
[166:48.56]Whoa, there's another one!
[167:04.01]Nooo, not gonna do that shit.
[167:09.14]somebody charge at me somebody do something it's fine I'll start it
[167:34.07]What?
[167:35.67]That was very odd.
[167:44.34]Can I interrupt that or something?
[167:46.38]Or do I just have to run away?
[167:53.40]Too far away.
[167:58.97]Still too far away.
[168:04.96]Oh, really?
[168:12.48]How is that even possible?
[168:26.97]Again, I don't know how it's possible for me to miss that.
[168:29.49]There's only one sliver that's even possible to hit there.
[168:33.93]Use the other stick to aim better?
[168:37.38]Right stick or something?
[168:38.14]I feel like I just manually do it.
[168:40.38]You have plenty of time.
[168:46.04]Maybe I'm just freaking out.
[168:47.30]I think I have like a second or two.
[168:48.50]Cut fire extinguisher.
[169:05.43]Alright, I did it.
[169:07.83]That filled up the whole room.
[169:13.99]Uh, can I not open this door?
[169:26.35]This looks like a door I can slash through.
[169:27.73]Apparently you go down here.
[169:39.87]What do I eat on a day that I stream?
[169:43.11]Uh... Like an hour before, and then that's it.
[169:57.72]This is an after-I.E.
[170:12.85]Alright, well.
[170:13.59]Looks like we're starting here.
[170:16.09]I wanted to try to get a bolt.
[170:23.22]I did.
[170:25.75]Panicked there for a second.
[170:39.18]I do have lots of time.
[170:40.08]I really need to stop freaking out.
[170:47.78]What's the difference between Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Horizon?
[170:55.45]One of them is a sword game and the other one is a... When you...
[171:04.97]For now.
[171:05.41]Stealth.
[171:05.92]Stealth.
[171:06.18]There it is.
[171:06.72]But that room, those were cyborg brain casings.
[171:10.52]Duh.
[171:11.28]We saw.
[171:12.40]George said they were harvesting organs from kids.
[171:15.26]Yes.
[171:16.12]This must be why they are trafficking children.
[171:18.40]Perhaps other organs are being sold elsewhere, but they are definitely taking their brains.
[171:23.43]Jesus.
[171:24.49]Are they making these kids into cyborgs?
[171:26.71]Wait.
[171:27.65]The cyborgs you've been fighting, do they seem like they might be kids?
[171:31.89]You said earlier that child soldiers have a telltale approach to combat.
[171:35.16]I just want to open this up.
[171:36.18]Bad time, guys.
[171:36.70]Come on.
[171:36.90]He changes his voice.
[171:38.34]He does the Christian Bale Batman thing.
[171:41.42]Sometimes he just goes like this.
[171:42.32]Sometimes.
[172:16.98]Alright, I don't know why you do that.
[172:17.92]That's the equivalent of picking up like a pretzel you found on the ground.
[172:20.54]You don't just put that into your brain.
[172:21.90]Oh, god damn it.
[172:30.22]No, I don't want to do this part.
[172:31.06]God damn it!
[172:42.65]Try latching onto cyborgs' heads from behind.
[172:45.41]Then, an electric shock should knock them unconscious.
[172:50.67]Do we really have to have an avoid-everybody-Spider-Man-Mary-Jane mission?
[172:57.12]I want that.
[172:57.56]Give that to me.
[173:03.44]What am I looking for?
[173:04.02]A terminal or something?
[173:17.33]Am I friend?
[173:17.86]What do we do?
[173:18.26]I'm sorry.
[173:22.40]I'M SORRY!
[173:29.28]So I gotta go that way.
[173:30.14]Alright, got a guy there.
[173:45.57]I'm thinking...
[173:50.72]Alright.
[173:52.76]Another one of those assholes.
[173:54.81]I need to get rid of that guy.
[173:55.65]That would have been a really good moment.
[174:09.51]Whoa!
[174:10.19]How do I stop him?
[174:10.81]How do I like attach on his head?
[174:24.62]Got it.
[174:25.06]Ah, I see the joke they did.
[174:26.46]You can never get a USB the first time you try to put a USB in.
[174:46.95]The USB joke.
[174:49.47]It's perfect.
[174:50.85]Explaining the joke.
[174:51.71]Well, just in case somebody didn't ever put a USB in a computer before.
[174:54.13]Don't they have, like, new, like, the lightning cable?
[174:56.29]You might not even know what that is.
[174:59.18]USB in five years is gonna be, like, saying DVD.
[175:02.26]Half of you guys don't even know what a DVD is.
[175:10.49]Sending one old Georgie boy used on the kids in Liberia.
[175:14.85]Of course, it's right straight to the brain now.
[175:18.17]Feels as real as anything else.
[175:20.91]Yeah, DVD was like 25 years ago.
[175:22.79]And your work is light.
[175:25.99]Some of you guys might not even know what that is.
[175:27.19]We'd get sick before our cover is blown.
[175:29.75]We'd get some assholes snooping around.
[175:34.57]We just do not have the full quantity yet.
[175:37.41]Each brain has its own...
[175:45.83]D-I-V-I.
[175:48.43]D-I, somebody wrote.
[175:49.59]What is a DVD?
[175:51.23]Thank you for understanding.
[175:53.88]I will destroy any unharvested inventory.
[175:58.06]But have you any idea what they cost?
[176:03.26]Last I checked, baby children weren't exactly rare in the part of the world.
[176:07.62]Millions of them, in fact.
[176:09.78]You can get more once we set up a new lab.
[176:12.74]They lead lives of hunger and pain.
[176:16.00]We're performing a service here for them and the cities they burden.
[176:21.27]But just gathering the donors required a significant investment.
[176:24.91]Yes, yes.
[176:25.73]You'll get the money.
[176:27.05]Accounting will be in touch.
[176:29.19]Gracias.
[176:30.19]I assure you, with the fulls of our inventory in the instant, we can confirm payment.
[176:34.43]Are we done here?
[176:36.79]I've got a full slate today.
[176:40.55]Tecumseh is a demanding mistress.
[176:43.33]And I can't believe we're in Dr. Eggman's outfit.
[176:46.89]Combine all the characters in this game and you'll have Dr. Eggman.
[176:53.44]You see that, Kev?
[176:54.82]In Mani's killer.
[176:56.06]Desperado's chief of operations goes by Sundowner, the Californian wildfire.
[177:01.80]The kids.
[177:03.12]Think we're too late?
[177:03.94]There's only one way to find out.
[177:06.48]George was still alive.
[177:08.38]Maybe the payment hasn't come through yet.
[177:11.11]Maybe.
[177:11.99]But you heard what he said.
[177:13.45]They've already started some brains on VR training.
[177:16.34]There must be more than just what I found here.
[177:18.77]What about the VIP in the suit?
[177:20.83]I'll find out.
[177:22.25]Definitely seem familiar.
[177:23.05]Why does he have a cosplayer following him around?
[177:28.51]Find the captive children.
[177:29.87]You got it.
[177:37.52]Metal Gear Solid 3.
[177:40.14]Sons of Anarchy.
[177:46.76]NOOOO!
[177:47.94]I'm about to scream so loud.
[177:56.37]What the hell?
[178:01.85]Made up for it.
[178:03.68]That was a villain death scream.
[178:15.10]It can't be!
[178:35.07]Villain haircut, villain voice.
[178:36.52]I'm playing the part here.
[178:38.88]You guys think I'm a villain?
[178:40.02]Really, though?
[178:41.26]Like, if I was in the DBZ cinematic universe, would I be a villain?
[178:49.99]You think so?
[178:58.45]Stop calling me!
[179:00.11]What?
[179:03.36]maybe the coordinates DVD cinematic universe I merged the gps location of our entry with all my movement data from that point on this is bad you think they got to him Mr. Satan from dbc that's me I'll have our guys sweep the area thanks oh I guess when you think goku can't come any closer Mr. Satan take care
[179:38.60]I'm gonna get copyright strikes by doing Mr. Satan.
[179:41.79]I've never even seen the show.
[179:44.21]The only episode of DBZ I've ever seen.
[179:46.35]Mr. Satan came on screen and said that, and then I changed the fucking channel.
[179:50.53]I don't know any of the lines in that whole thing.
[179:58.32]Well, did we get him?
[180:00.50]I don't know.
[180:07.45]Sick dodge.
[180:15.21]And a... I'm hurting, right?
[180:24.72]Alright, you got like a bunch of headshots there.
[180:29.16]Oh, that, again, when it glows like that, it's easy.
[180:40.40]Transformer is seriously annoying me.
[180:42.37]I'm gonna stand up.
[180:46.93]Yeah, yep, I know.
[180:48.33]Dude, why the heck don't they give you, like, why the heck don't they give you, like, at least a second before starting the mission?
[181:13.31]Alright.
[181:14.93]I gotta get out of the corner.
[181:16.05]The camera likes to do this thing where it just does a profile view.
[181:19.92]Can you just stay behind me?
[181:25.08]Just stay behind me.
[181:30.06]Then I tried to block it, too.
[181:31.54]Come on!
[181:36.59]Like, what is this camera view?
[181:38.09]Like, I don't want this.
[181:38.95]I want it behind me.
[181:59.81]Come here.
[182:00.31]Where'd he go?
[182:01.53]What?
[182:30.33]Up top.
[182:31.89]What have you done?
[182:32.83]What's happening to me?
[182:33.73]Why am I... Oh my god, it just... I... I was done.
[182:43.25]I already did it.
[182:46.73]Just chop his fucking heads off.
[182:55.09]I hate this enemy.
[182:57.37]I hate being in this room with this guy.
[183:14.71]I don't have enough time though.
[183:43.74]Alright, please.
[183:47.83]I hate this thing.
[183:49.41]I don't want to fight this thing again.
[184:02.88]right I knew I'd seen that guy before Stephen Armstrong this becomes a regular enemy Colorado senator Steven thanks for watching the stream everybody they're already talking about him as a shoe-in for the nomination in 2020.
[184:15.82]And guess what?
[184:17.00]Two years ago, a federal grand jury investigated his ties to a certain private world marshal.
[184:23.56]One of the biggest PMCs out there.
[184:27.06]The biggest ever since the big five split up.
[184:29.94]Not to mention the single largest investor in military cyborg R&D in the world.
[184:35.07]Guess that answers the question of who's backing Desperado.
[184:38.17]Marshall and Desperado in bed together.
[184:41.67]Justin Turnbull Lake.
[184:42.65]Headlines.
[184:45.15]This is World Marshal and a U.S.
[184:46.98]Senator we're talking about.
[184:48.46]Page, Phoebe, Ross.
[184:52.12]No major media outlet will investigate allegations like these.
[184:55.48]It'd be financial and political suicide.
[184:58.11]So we just what?
[184:59.69]Sit back while they keep carving up kids?
[185:01.73]Stand aside while they build an army of cyborgs?
[185:04.79]You heard them.
[185:05.57]Chandler.
[185:06.05]They shut down one lab, they build another.
[185:08.55]They're planning something big.
[185:10.61]We can't just wait for it to happen.
[185:12.63]We need to hit them first and hit them hard where it counts.
[185:15.67]No, Raiden, no.
[185:17.07]I know what you're thinking and just know.
[185:18.76]Courtney Cox's character whose name I can't remember.
[185:21.86]And America has these things called laws.
[185:25.16]You playing this like a Dark Souls game?
[185:28.06]I know.
[185:28.38]It's alright, though.
[185:29.00]I'm still having fun.
[185:30.40]Wait.
[185:30.72]No secrets in this room?
[185:33.04]Who made this game?
[185:59.20]Kevin out.
[186:43.29]That would have been cool if it didn't bounce the right way.
[186:55.40]Distraction crack.
[186:58.08]It worked.
[187:06.26]The one guy was right.
[187:07.78]The sub-weapons are...
[187:12.35]They're a little on the iffy for me here.
[187:15.17]Using Deadeye.
[187:20.11]Drink blood, drink the blood, drink the blood.
[187:37.22]You can preserve an arm, a brain, any body part for several hours.
[187:41.80]So what are they freezing, and why?
[187:44.06]I could not say.
[187:45.50]Perhaps they plan to sell off the organs of the children they were told to dispose of.
[187:50.09]Unbelievable.
[187:51.61]You had best hurry, Reiner.
[187:53.37]Right.
[187:53.67]Unbelievable.
[187:58.96]Where is she?
[188:14.52]Where's Harvey?
[188:16.96]Shit.
[188:20.08]Hey, stop right there.
[188:25.14]Open this door right now.
[188:34.50]George.
[188:36.03]Right in.
[188:36.31]You've heard of chloroform?
[188:40.33]A potent anesthetic in smaller doses.
[188:54.28]I'm really taking my time with this.
[189:02.37]Quick, think!
[189:04.69]Break the glass!
[189:06.01]Or save the kid!
[189:07.19]Break the glass!
[189:07.85]I got five seconds to figure it out!
[189:10.33]Which one?
[189:11.43]Right in.
[189:12.35]Don't worry about me now.
[189:13.63]Quiet, pendejo.
[189:17.58]Surrender.
[189:18.04]Yeah, telltale time.
[189:21.12]I won't ask again.
[189:26.06]George, are you sure?
[189:32.90]I'm ready.
[189:34.10]Me life know so precious thing.
[189:36.54]What if me can take this scunt to hell with me?
[189:39.50]Quiet then.
[189:42.60]Uh, the kids are literally pretty, man.
[189:44.76]Like, just, you can't... You know, they're choking in there.
[189:53.41]This is not a walking scenario.
[190:14.28]Holy shit, you killed the kid!
[190:16.91]You missed!
[190:33.19]Wait, I don't open up the... BSB AAAAB.
[190:41.43]B, S, B, A, A, A, A, B. That's a B. Shouldn't that be an A?
[190:48.13]If you have... Hold on a minute.
[190:49.88]If you get an A+, four A's and three B's, how is that not like a B+, or an A-?
[190:57.26]Three B's, four A's, and an A+.
[191:02.69]The S is the A+.
[191:14.84]Okay, I got the mariachi uniform.
[191:21.86]Because you suck, streamer.
[191:23.08]Alright, let's take a look.
[191:33.46]Life.
[191:35.84]Enhance two.
[191:38.82]This is 10,000.
[191:40.58]What do I have?
[191:42.48]69,069.
[191:44.00]That's not even funny, but I mean, it is.
[191:53.37]That's not funny.
[191:57.25]Endurance 2.
[192:02.47]I'm assuming I can do that with everything now.
[192:05.13]Fuel Cell 2.
[192:10.46]And body.
[192:11.16]Got some new bodies.
[192:16.22]20,000.
[192:21.10]But this one has regeneration.
[192:30.71]The suit excels against tanks, UAVs, attack helicopter, and other anti-infantry.
[192:37.67]But that one has a hat.
[192:42.92]Buy the funny streamer outfit.
[192:50.22]No, I don't want to buy the funny, like, streamer outfit.
[192:59.15]This is another one of those scenarios where every playthrough you've ever seen has done that.
[193:05.29]Have you watched one YouTube Let's Play of this or one streamer that didn't go, oh, yeah!
[193:22.40]Do not disobey us.
[193:23.36]I'd rather be, uh, Gray Fox.
[193:28.78]No, I haven't.
[193:29.72]Now buy it.
[193:30.98]No, I'm saving my money.
[193:32.56]Because I want to upgrade my weapons.
[193:33.86]I don't want to be useless.
[193:38.74]What can I do with this one?
[193:42.44]Alright, good strength.
[193:43.66]Strength +2.
[193:44.98]I'm going back to the sword.
[193:52.31]More damage.
[193:55.91]Lame, in all capitals.
[193:57.28]Lame.
[193:57.74]Absorption, two.
[194:00.88]Energy, two.
[194:02.32]I'm going back to the sword.
[194:04.50]Lame, lame, lame.
[194:05.62]Oh, wow, lame.
[194:06.48]I don't even have the money for it, so too bad.
[194:08.68]I'm sorry, guys.
[194:09.66]Come on.
[194:12.18]I can afford this.
[194:17.88]No, I... No!
[194:24.32]Lame.
[194:25.70]And I didn't even... You guys got in my head.
[194:27.46]Now... I'm gonna use the... I'm gonna... Streamer's gonna lose all viewers because he doesn't buy the funny man outfit.
[194:43.63]I'm not... I'm not doing that.
[194:46.89]Sometimes I cave and I do that, but no, I'm gonna keep the healing suit on.
[194:49.93]Here comes the meme level.
[194:56.52]No, I'm gonna gain viewers because I didn't put on the funny streamer outfit.
[195:00.40]Someone's gonna open... I'm talking over the cutscene again.
[195:05.44]I'm... Yo, me ninja brother.
[195:11.91]George.
[195:13.19]Good to see you up and about.
[195:14.77]How you feeling?
[195:16.75]Never better, nah?
[195:17.90]No pain, no more for Star Wild and hunger space eat, and me never ever feel so awake, nah?
[195:23.51]That's because your blood sugar levels are being maintained automatically.
[195:27.39]Beats the hell out of coffee.
[195:29.57]Oh!
[195:30.25]Maybe here you go, one of them scone in the base.
[195:32.69]Why did I say you're not taking me with you, huh?
[195:35.49]Damn it, Doc.
[195:36.96]Sorry, kid.
[195:38.06]You'd just be in the way.
[195:40.68]Besides, I thought you didn't want to be a killer.
[195:43.82]Right.
[195:44.58]Me don't, but killing isn't fun and games.
[195:49.22]Remember that.
[195:52.60]Right.
[196:05.98]Who the fuck are those people?
[196:08.46]Who are those people?
[196:09.60]What would you do if you turned over on the highway and just see this guy?
[196:18.17]I guess, would that be really that out of the ordinary?
[196:20.37]That would be kind of out of the ordinary though, right?
[196:37.29]I am in a battle gear, so that's another thing.
[196:40.96]Driving level?
[196:42.64]I hope so.
[196:44.62]Sorry, Boris.
[196:45.52]It's done.
[196:46.44]Can't have a Maverick employee involved in a corporate raiding now, can we?
[196:50.22]You could at least come talk to me.
[196:52.55]No.
[196:54.19]It was time to break away from the old team, Boris.
[196:56.69]Past time.
[196:57.67]You cannot take on Marshall all by yourself.
[197:00.75]I won't sit by while they butcher little kids and ship their parts around like meat.
[197:04.95]It's sick.
[197:05.60]Pretty good driver.
[197:06.94]They import those brains legally, for medical purposes.
[197:10.82]It's all dumb.
[197:11.68]Being legal doesn't make it right.
[197:13.46]Hold that thought.
[197:16.38]I don't have a bow at all in front of my windshield, like a fucking side windshield.
[197:25.47]Fuck you, asshole!
[197:29.36]Alright, take this last 15 seconds and cut it into a GTA 5 calculation.
[197:34.20]You would not make a difference.
[197:37.61]Especially with the fuck-you-asshole guy on the window.
[198:00.00]Just once I wish a show or a TV or something would... It's not badass to do that.
[198:05.04]I just want there to be bright green puke all over his chest and mouth and stuff.
[198:09.46]Like, you would puke if that happened.
[198:11.64]You would throw up.
[198:15.69]Why can't they just have that?
[198:22.49]I will patrol ahead.
[198:29.35]Not everyone is a weakling like you.
[198:34.09]If your car flips upside down, going like a hundred miles per hour, you're going to puke.
[198:41.24]Not me.
[198:57.98]Uh-oh, it's Striker from Mortal Kombat!
[199:00.14]And it's his level!
[199:07.33]I didn't even equip... I have the wrong weapon.
[199:09.07]No, I'm out of range.
[199:24.00]Why is it... Okay, I wanna... I'm facing the guy that I can do this to.
[199:45.68]He's parrying me.
[199:47.98]That was a septuple parry.
[199:52.13]That felt like perfect parry.
[199:56.37]This guy, I've heard him.
[200:26.95]days from retirement.
[200:32.38]Secrets.
[200:37.68]Nope.
[200:37.92]Get away from that.
[200:44.82]Alright, let's try a perfect parry.
[200:51.11]Apparently that was not a perfect parry.
[200:59.57]Can I get two?
[201:00.03]Nah, I don't have one.
[201:05.67]Damn it.
[201:12.56]He parries when you do- oh yeah, okay, that makes sense.
[201:16.14]He just parries it back.
[201:23.41]Don't steal their spines.
[201:24.49]The road is blocked by barricades.
[201:26.70]We will proceed through the buildings.
[201:28.46]You will follow me.
[201:29.60]If you perfect parry enough times, you will insta-kill him.
[201:33.76]Remember I told you I didn't want to fight?
[201:38.42]Now I gotta fight too.
[201:39.02]Alright, I gotta put my pants on.
[201:39.78]Hold on.
[201:39.94]Alright, cut his ears off.
[202:03.10]Run.
[202:03.18]I'm just gonna run when he does that shit.
[202:05.01]It's easier.
[202:14.50]Good dodge.
[202:15.18]Good dodge!
[202:29.24]Ah!
[202:29.38]God damn it.
[202:30.50]You have to let go.
[202:33.12]It's kind of awkward.
[202:36.64]Like, when I jump up, I have to let go and press it again?
[202:44.74]Am I missing something here?
[202:49.08]I really am playing this like Dark Souls and I can't help it.
[202:52.13]I'm trying to like, I'm trying to invincibility frames half the shit that's going on.
[203:28.77]Try this again.
[203:29.07]Got it.
[203:29.21]Play Jebel may cry?
[203:29.59]I don't know, maybe.
[203:54.01]Uhh. People are dropping behind me.
[204:02.00]Alright, sneak up behind them and press B. Oh, okay, you have to be... Alright, well, I missed it.
[204:09.50]I get... Alright, that's the first time I've ever done that.
[204:12.79]So you sneak up behind them, and then press B, and then left trigger.
[204:17.47]Easy enough, okay.
[204:18.13]You have to be right up their ass.
[204:34.80]I got it.
[204:35.90]Alright, we're good.
[204:39.65]The indicator moves, it's difficult.
[204:41.37]Give me the box.
[204:59.93]I mean, let's be honest here.
[205:01.71]What was the actual... How was I getting out of that?
[205:05.21]I mean, was I going to really wait there for like 30 seconds while the guy walked all the way across?
[205:09.78]No.
[205:10.48]I want to play.
[205:20.98]Use the right stick to aim your cut.
[205:22.82]Doesn't right stick swing, though?
[205:25.07]Doesn't right stick just swing?
[205:26.15]Oh, man.
[205:26.31]And you let go.
[205:26.73]Okay, alright.
[205:27.09]I thought right stick just swung in the direction.
[205:29.05]You have to hold it.
[205:46.22]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[205:46.70]Somehow that's harder for me to do.
[206:17.79]Oh, really?
[206:18.21]A fucking grenade.
[206:21.11]I thought you were gonna swing.
[206:25.17]Welp.
[206:26.81]Okay, I did it.
[206:27.45]Takes a little getting used to.
[206:36.34]I should probably learn how to do it, though.
[206:39.08]Another wave?
[206:39.40]Is that- that's it?
[206:45.26]Only three people?
[206:46.92]What's up with that?
[206:50.66]I'm gonna need to do that for later.
[206:53.92]Well, I'm gonna just try to get used to it.
[206:58.99]No boxes?
[207:00.63]Well, there's this.
[207:04.15]That was not worth going all the way down there for.
[207:07.35]I'm ignoring the posters.
[207:08.57]What do you mean, posters?
[207:17.79]Don't look at the poster.
[207:22.12]At the beginning of the whole level?
[207:23.38]I gotta go back to the beginning of the whole level?
[207:24.70]There's a porn poster.
[207:37.43]Whatever, that's fine.
[207:38.67]I'm sure it's really funny.
[207:47.78]Ryden, what's your status?
[207:49.59]They trashed my car.
[207:51.15]I'll have to go the rest of the way on foot.
[207:53.53]Do you really have to do this?
[207:55.61]Look, I'm fed up with all of it.
[207:58.13]Companies like ours, yours, bend the laws when it suits business.
[208:02.69]Why not bend it when it can save innocent lives?
[208:05.79]Right.
[208:07.37]Boris, listen to me.
[208:08.95]That VR training, they'll be warped into killing machines.
[208:12.69]They'll be set on POWs, civilians.
[208:15.53]It'll be one atrocity after another.
[208:18.15]Hmm.
[208:19.30]Like what you went through.
[208:21.04]We can't have any more Jack the Ripper's.
[208:23.60]You saw what happened with George.
[208:26.15]I'm doing this, Boris.
[208:27.59]I have to.
[208:28.37]I can't save those kids from becoming cyborgs, but I can stop them from becoming murderers.
[208:33.55]So you succeed?
[208:35.27]So you get all the brains back?
[208:36.79]Then what?
[208:37.85]Just so happens I know one great cybernetic surgeon.
[208:41.67]Doctor, but he cannot.
[208:44.01]You won't change my mind, Boris.
[208:45.93]This is my fight now.
[208:47.97]And your wife and son?
[208:49.43]What of them?
[208:49.95]I have a wife and son.
[208:50.96]They're in New Zealand.
[208:52.24]Safe.
[208:53.20]Rose would understand why I have to do this.
[208:57.10]Alright.
[208:57.72]Nice trying not to wake up parents for me.
[208:59.32]You do realize Marshall has the contract for law enforcement throughout the city?
[209:02.61]They are the law.
[209:03.53]What the hell?
[209:04.49]Idiot.
[209:04.67]Yeah, we've met.
[209:05.81]You fucking idiot.
[209:08.31]What's wrong with you?
[209:09.27]Officially.
[209:10.99]Incorporated condemns you actions as unlawful and a pain in the asshole No, I'm not worried about the leg this game too loud sure turn the game down unofficially It's been like three hours over the codec to help.
[209:28.41]I came to love mudaki.
[209:30.07]I'm doing any more than you Spasiba to honest Spasiba
[209:38.69]No, that's good.
[209:39.25]Alright.
[209:41.45]I unlocked, uh, number 9.
[209:44.73]For VR missions.
[209:45.54]What about... chests or anything?
[209:57.43]That's... I mean... That's pretty... Alright, I didn't know I needed to do that.
[210:00.91]I got BP for that.
[210:03.61]No I didn't, it's on the ground.
[210:10.64]What a vandal.
[210:23.11]No, no, no, no, no.
[210:25.55]Can I equip the sword from a quick menu or do I have to wait?
[210:29.83]Hi.
[210:41.05]Uh, alright, well... I don't like fighting enemies in these little rooms.
[210:47.91]It's hard for me to see what's even going on.
[211:01.30]Oh, dodge!
[211:28.92]Dammit.
[211:29.74]I cut the one part of his body off that I needed to cut.
[211:32.70]Somehow.
[211:34.14]Through all that.
[211:38.03]Oh my god.
[211:52.06]Just moo back at them.
[212:01.58]And that's not a block.
[212:03.28]How is that a... How is that... Why does it do that sometimes?
[212:07.84]Come here.
[212:10.68]You're too far away.
[212:11.72]Oh my lord.
[212:27.33]I can just use the D-pad?
[212:30.42]Alright, well that's a C because fuck fighting two huge enemies in a little room.
[212:36.80]Get this stupid thing off.
[212:38.10]How do I confirm?
[212:42.64]Is it on?
[212:51.81]I can't tell if it's on.
[212:57.22]Well, I don't know how to lock on, because when I lock on in a small room like that, the camera just rips around like crazy.
[213:12.80]Oh, man.
[213:13.36]I don't know if we're ever going to be able to get used to that.
[213:38.94]Okay, get this off.
[213:43.72]Alright, finally.
[213:44.52]We're good.
[213:53.42]Told you the polearm sucked.
[213:54.80]I don't know about that, it's just... it's kinda slow.
[213:57.97]doc what's your status I am reviewing the pre-flight checklist now I have had a huge radius shipping the brain units we should be airborne in just a few minutes you sure you can pilot that chopper by yourself need I remind you that we live in the golden age of unmanned flight even manned helicopters possess a robust semi-automatic mode it is simple really so simple that I can continue to monitor your status and world martial security from the
[214:27.60]Jeremy, your stream crashed my computer.
[214:29.99]Thanks.
[214:30.99]-2.
[214:34.37]That's not... Why am I getting a -2 for that?
[214:36.80]That's not a joke?
[214:37.60]-2?! !
[214:41.10]Nevertheless, the data I did find should prove useful.
[214:45.16]So please, do feel free to contact me whenever you like.
[214:49.10]Appreciate it, Doc.
[214:50.22]That joke wasn't very funny, Jeremy.
[214:51.58]Not every day one has the chance to collect so many brains.
[214:54.34]Think of the data, the research.
[214:57.31]Oh, and of course, your personal safety was a concern as well.
[215:03.71]Head to the rear.
[215:09.16]I have a rocket launcher, right?
[215:10.62]Two.
[215:11.80]Rocket propelled grenade.
[215:12.94]Oh, I'm gonna keep this on just because there's helicopters and shit.
[215:18.05]I don't really feel like fighting.
[215:28.53]Well, uh... Alright, that's how you... I don't know how I missed that many times.
[215:33.61]But, I mean, look at where the... You saw that.
[215:37.46]I didn't... That was not me.
[215:39.12]I did it... It was fine.
[215:40.52]Do I still get it right?
[215:45.52]I did.
[216:01.10]Okay, really?
[216:02.44]What?
[216:04.14]I went right through the damn thing.
[216:09.04]Use the environment to your advantage.
[216:10.32]I gotta get on top of here.
[216:12.99]Can you see me?
[216:29.51]I don't like the Spider-Man villains.
[216:30.73]They're annoying.
[216:33.21]Can I go behind that guy?
[216:35.73]Is it possible that I could sneak behind him?
[216:37.83]No.
[216:38.83]No.
[216:39.29]No.
[216:43.25]No.
[216:52.46]I can't do it from up here!
[216:54.75]I can't do this from up here!
[216:55.91]Oh, why would I have to be down?
[216:58.71]Why?
[216:59.27]Why?
[216:59.89]If I was only just down.
[217:27.91]If I hold the right stick, oh, I know.
[217:30.38]It's just, it's very difficult for me to do that.
[217:34.70]I feel like it's harder for me to do that than just trying to aim with left stick and then press triangle, or Y and X. What would you like me to do?
[217:49.58]Jump, okay.
[217:54.68]That's the thing that's gonna stop me?
[218:09.28]There are stairs.
[218:09.94]Why use stairs when you can slice through everything?
[218:16.93]It's more fun that way.
[218:23.97]Got a hammer.
[218:25.11]Oh, okay.
[218:29.55]I can't carry that one.
[218:35.63]These guys gotta go.
[218:36.39]You gotta fucking die.
[218:49.98]No, no, that's not what I wanted to do.
[218:51.32]I got some kind of achievement for some reason.
[219:15.08]Two hammer guys, this is gonna be fun!
[219:18.79]What was that magnet-pathing bullshit?
[219:21.47]He just, like, attached to my body.
[219:22.93]Why are you Dark Souls locked down here?
[219:24.79]That's bullshit.
[219:36.70]That guy doesn't have any...
[220:12.17]That poor vent.
[220:21.30]Okay, can I go?
[220:28.85]There's a ladder right there.
[220:31.69]Come on, there's a ladder next to me.
[220:33.27]I can't use it.
[220:52.07]I might as well just use this, because why not?
[220:59.80]Did that miss?
[221:00.32]Is that even possible?
[221:05.44]Hold?
[221:05.74]No?
[221:05.80]Okay, never mind.
[221:07.42]Where are you going?
[221:14.29]Dodge?
[221:15.05]Good dodge!
[221:21.62]Am I gonna beat the whole game today?
[221:28.34]Uh, that depends, huh?
[221:29.52]I wonder how much... I'll try.
[221:31.15]I'll try to get through the whole thing.
[221:37.27]Raiden!
[221:37.81]Raiden, respond!
[221:39.37]Raiden!
[221:40.43]RAIDEN!
[221:49.54]Uh... the indicator was... what?
[221:54.06]The indicator was sitting... oh my god.
[221:58.00]That was an indicator issue, and I thought there was a ledge, just... I thought there was another place to drop down, apparent... apparent... whatever.
[222:03.66]I'm not gonna complain.
[222:44.54]Well, that's not... What happened?
[222:49.61]That was... I'm just as confused as all of you are.
[223:00.21]Okay, this time...
[223:03.36]go to edge but no don't go to edge I have to just go over there I for some reason just saw the blip and I was like oh there's probably a door down there for a second I thought I did it again
[223:39.07]Okay.
[223:40.92]Come on.
[223:54.99]No, it's right trigger to run.
[223:58.15]Can I get both these guys from far away?
[223:59.47]They kill him every time.
[224:01.33]Am I supposed to be rescuing these guys?
[224:20.74]I love how someone just goes, maybe.
[224:29.60]I don't know, maybe.
[224:51.98]Don't follow him down there.
[224:57.90]Oh don't oh my god Alright You cannot proceed any further via the rooftops there is a freight railroad underground
[225:22.10]Do it for the joke?
[225:22.82]No, I have to start the whole thing over.
[225:26.18]I don't want to start the whole thing over.
[225:35.50]If I do that again, I swear to God... I keep pressing left trigger to run.
[225:42.66]I have to cut it.
[225:45.65]Did I just... I didn't just kill myself, did I?
[225:53.85]Apparently not.
[225:57.21]This must be the railroad.
[225:59.09]It would appear so.
[226:00.45]Likely part of Denver's old system.
[226:02.79]Couldn't just take the elevator like a normal person.
[226:04.19]This city was a major transport hub in the early years of freight trains.
[226:07.54]This particular line appears to have been abandoned some time ago.
[226:11.44]It was originally constructed to transport supplies to an underground factory.
[226:16.14]But now it seems even the electrical system is no longer functioning.
[226:20.44]Yeah, it's pitch black in here.
[226:23.02]As a cyborg, I trust this is not a serious concern.
[226:26.50]I hate this.
[226:32.39]I don't- I don't hate this anymore.
[226:37.67]Nah, nevermind, I do hate this.
[226:41.43]Oh, get out of the fucking way.
[226:56.85]Look at those enemies in here.
[227:01.14]That's wonderful.
[227:10.92]Night vision goggles.
[227:12.05]Can I just skip fighting these guys?
[227:13.27]Oh, okay.
[227:14.65]So... I should... do this then.
[227:27.03]Alright, it's only, it's one or the other, I can't be in the box.
[227:31.93]Ah, hold on, wait, that, why, why, why, they can see me!
[227:36.21]Why can, hold on a minute, I'm confused here.
[227:42.96]It, it's pitch black, we can, do they have the same items that I do?
[227:49.64]Don't expose yourself, apparently.
[227:54.96]They also have the night vision.
[227:56.18]I thought I had to be a little closer than that.
[228:01.27]Oh, he just glued to my body.
[228:03.45]Get that arm!
[228:18.18]Oh my god.
[228:34.44]Alright, I need to get in a better spot.
[228:45.67]Somewhere over here.
[228:59.08]Slide.
[229:00.54]Fuck.
[229:09.04]Just trying to dodge it.
[229:18.66]Oh my lord.
[229:29.15]Please.
[229:29.89]Can I please not do this again?
[229:31.10]Let me just move the fuck on from this, please.
[229:46.41]Activate the train.
[229:53.22]Um, wait.
[230:09.92]You know what?
[230:10.32]I'm getting stuck in animations.
[230:11.88]That's one of the problems.
[230:13.08]I'm going to swing, swing, and then I see that I need to block, but I'm in the middle of a swing, and I can't do it.
[230:22.81]Is that even... I don't even know if I can block that.
[230:36.99]I can't.
[230:37.45]Okay.
[230:48.03]I thought I got his arm.
[230:54.25]I hate this dark level!
[230:56.23]Fucking hell!
[230:57.38]Oh my god!
[230:58.44]He just keeps doing it!
[231:01.98]I can't stop it!
[231:04.02]Stop it, my god!
[231:05.68]Just cut his fucking body in half!
[231:09.58]Jesus, what the hell?
[231:16.14]There's somebody else in here.
[231:18.97]Who's the person in here?
[231:21.09]What?
[231:21.33]There's like an enemy right here.
[231:23.80]Who?
[231:34.64]It's one of those fucking idiots up there.
[231:42.01]He's gonna alert.
[231:42.95]I gotta like throw a fucking group.
[231:44.13]Do I just shoot this thing?
[231:47.35]I'm just gonna shoot a fucking rocket at this guy.
[231:54.30]Alright, I did it.
[231:55.02]Ugh, my... There is a maintenance shaft up ahead.
[232:11.54]Use it to return to the surface.
[232:15.31]No, no, no, don't put the rocket launcher down.
[232:18.39]You fucking idiot.
[232:21.11]I wish I could have the night vision on and have the box open.
[232:25.60]So there's a guy right there.
[232:26.70]There's people on the ceiling.
[232:29.78]I guess I could... If I throw an EMP grenade, can I run by?
[232:48.34]I have a few of them.
[232:49.28]Electromagnetic.
[232:54.56]Or jamming.
[232:57.13]No, it's this one.
[233:00.49]Oh boy.
[233:00.93]I have no idea.
[233:01.89]Okay, well... I hope I'm throwing this in the right spot.
[233:16.31]Well, that didn't... That distracted him.
[233:23.72]Was it enough?
[233:24.16]I might have to wait.
[233:29.66]I don't really... Maybe I can just go by without fighting.
[233:34.43]Or try and stealth kill?
[233:36.39]He's not going to see me right here, right?
[233:42.21]I don't know if this is the right time to go in, but I have to turn this off.
[233:44.69]I need to wait until he starts walking again.
[233:47.98]Because this has to go off, and then how am I gonna... You can stealth kill big guy, and there's like people all over the ceiling.
[234:29.40]Yes, wait, I have to do- I have to- I can't- I can't move!
[234:33.24]I have to dodge.
[234:34.89]You can't do any animations to do anything in this game.
[234:39.71]I have to not be moving to parry or to dodge.
[234:56.61]How did I not dodge that?
[234:58.15]I'm not gonna get fucking dropkicked again.
[235:18.60]Get me out of this level for God's sake.
[235:20.87]Give me a zero.
[235:21.89]I don't care.
[235:22.33]I hate this place.
[235:24.25]I'll take a fucking zero.
[235:29.10]Pitch black stealth mission.
[235:30.48]Get me the fuck out of here.
[235:44.27]It would appear your only way forward is to return to the surface.
[235:51.00]Go back to fucking Power Rangers, buddy.
[236:20.39]The Megazoid killed you in like episode 104.
[236:22.63]Fuck off.
[236:23.15]Woof woof.
[236:23.77]Has that happened yet?
[236:25.11]I don't remember.
[237:02.51]He didn't even parry there.
[237:03.75]Alright.
[237:06.47]Alright.
[237:14.12]Can I just take the bridge down?
[237:31.27]Please?
[237:32.79]Just make him fall.
[237:33.84]It'll be great, I promise.
[237:36.14]There's too much dust on the screen.
[237:47.19]I couldn't see.
[237:57.50]I wish I played this on hard.
[237:58.54]Oh, I don't.
[237:59.56]Oh, I would have gave up.
[238:00.94]I would have quit like fucking two hours ago.
[238:15.69]I would have played something else.
[238:16.67]Without a doubt.
[238:34.53]What are you doing?
[238:34.93]What are you doing?
[238:35.61]What are you doing?
[238:37.92]What are you doing?
[238:39.66]Fucking camera!
[238:44.92]Like, when you have to hit up and X to parry, and you end up hitting side, like, right, because...
[238:59.78]Where?
[239:01.79]Why did that have to?
[239:03.19]Why did that do that for?
[239:04.43]Enemy ahead, Ryden.
[239:13.48]Avoid fighting if you can.
[239:45.94]What?
[239:51.72]What a weird route you just had.
[239:54.52]That was the oddest route ever.
[240:05.87]He just got shot by his own guy.
[240:08.07]I'll take it.
[240:09.47]I'll take the victory here.
[240:19.30]More Patriot intel!
[240:20.42]Bring me more!
[240:21.53]And maybe I can develop something interesting from it!
[240:24.21]The Stark LQ-84 Fenrir.
[240:27.03]Unable to speak.
[240:28.65]A real dog has a far greater intellect.
[240:31.79]I actually have prompt to backstab.
[240:33.17]I don't... Am I fighting the dog?
[240:37.97]What's your problem, dog?
[240:41.01]It's the great point of the story where he turns.
[240:52.69]Come on, do it.
[240:57.78]Like, for instance, why?
[241:00.18]Come on!
[241:01.54]I can't parry when I have to press that, ugh.
[241:22.39]I really want to cut your thing off.
[241:23.57]Yeah.
[241:27.11]Fuck off.
[241:30.70]Are you trying to parry with Y?
[241:31.86]No, I'm trying... It's forward... It's forward and X to parry, right?
[241:36.58]Or, like, towards where they are.
[241:38.84]When the camera, like, like, rips around at .2 seconds, when you press the right button that you think you're pressing, it goes the other direction.
[241:54.11]Isn't this all a bit much any decent lunatic would have quit after Mexico jet stream sam But now here you are the child soldier fighting for the children Happy new year
[242:20.53]Fucking Snoke My sword is a means to an end to protect those you'd prey on really let me ask you
[242:44.80]All those cyborgs you've killed up to now.
[242:47.74]Maybe they weren't kids, but they were people.
[242:50.58]You ever think about them?
[242:52.24]When you're chopping them into hamburger?
[242:55.61]They're adults.
[242:56.57]They made their choice.
[242:58.69]Sure they're adults.
[243:00.79]Sure they signed up for this.
[243:02.73]Right on the dotted line of their BMC contract.
[243:06.13]Usually they're no strangers to all.
[243:08.62]In fact, many times they already lost a limb or two.
[243:13.36]Many times they were out of work and starving on the street.
[243:17.58]So yes, they signed up for surgery to fight God knows where.
[243:21.93]How else would you provide for your family?
[243:24.39]There's a tech director that's changing cameras here.
[243:27.65]This is a whole production.
[243:28.61]Bumped full of fear-inhibiting nanomachines and sent right into the blender?
[243:33.74]Your blender?
[243:35.60]But they made their choice, right?
[243:39.23]Open your eye and see, Raiden.
[243:42.09]Camera two in three, two, one, camera switch.
[243:46.40]Those battlefield emotions that the nanos press, listen to them.
[243:52.04]What are you talking about?
[243:53.08]Shh.
[243:59.46]There he is.
[244:00.96]Kill him.
[244:04.50]Can we take over?
[244:05.28]What's wrong?
[244:08.15]Is this the meme part of the game?
[244:13.52]Killer Deer Sample?
[244:14.42]Well, which one is it, dude?
[244:40.49]I didn't know what I was signing up for I can hear their thoughts I've nearly saved enough to bring mama to the stage
[245:09.20]Finish him off!
[245:11.24]Whatever it takes to be free of this torture.
[245:13.70]Stop it!
[245:15.58]Shut up, Forrest!
[245:17.94]He did it for you.
[245:20.30]What am I even fighting for?
[245:28.46]Dead on!
[245:31.74]Bullseye!
[245:34.67]What is that?
[245:35.29]Engaging!
[245:36.03]Fuck.
[245:37.34]Who shot me?
[245:37.90]Who shot me?
[245:38.34]I want to know their name.
[245:39.70]What the hell is going on?
[245:45.16]It's the guy with the fucking rocket launcher out there.
[245:49.82]Get off!
[245:59.73]There's no reason for me to be here.
[246:08.85]Psycho?
[246:09.35]What?
[246:09.49]Why am I a psycho?
[246:10.83]I'm just doing what I'm supposed to be doing.
[246:23.42]Raiden, are you injured?
[246:26.12]I thought they had a choice.
[246:28.12]A fair choice.
[246:29.98]Not like you.
[246:30.90]I don't want this life.
[246:31.72]He just rips out their spine.
[246:32.84]People are different.
[246:36.14]As opposed to AIs?
[246:39.29]You're all the same, huh?
[246:41.35]You and your brothers, manipulating mankind for our own good.
[246:46.82]It appears my statement has upset you.
[246:50.76]I apologize.
[246:53.31]No, it's... I know you're right.
[246:57.47]As for AIs, we adapt as we learn, just as any intellect operates, man or machine.
[247:05.00]Yeah, but I'm not.
[247:05.64]Altering the course of mankind is not allowed by the five directives.
[247:08.68]I'm half man, half machine, aren't I?
[247:10.58]I guess that's a relief.
[247:12.90]Samuel's behavior does not match established parameters you know him affirmative five percent together on three previous missions he proved most capable you think highly of him I have always found him so wait that's just not me in like a cool suit dependable until now scouting data for the next area
[247:41.13]I thought he just had like a cool jaw piece on.
[247:42.69]He's in a suit.
[247:43.57]Like a costume.
[247:45.83]It's just a costume.
[247:58.04]You want me to get out of here?
[248:07.75]Oh, man.
[248:08.65]Not... I don't want to do another avoid combat mission.
[248:16.44]Yeah, I can hear the nanomachines.
[248:17.88]I know that Raiden is a robot.
[248:19.38]I know.
[248:19.84]I'm just kidding around.
[248:26.12]I'm just ahead.
[248:26.84]What else we got?
[248:31.93]Any... I can use the train as cover.
[248:54.67]Why doesn't this Jerma YouTube video have any funny jokes?
[249:00.49]What, you want me to throw a grenade at the train and EMP myself?
[249:07.26]No, I gotta get to the end of this area.
[249:09.96]What do you want me to do?
[249:11.76]What can I do right now besides walk and grab item and go to next- I'm not gonna throw a grenade at somebody.
[249:22.44]It will make us laugh.
[249:25.54]Can I jump?
[249:26.14]I can't jump when I'm sad.
[249:43.67]I can't go in the box when I'm sad either.
[249:55.66]I don't think there's any way I can avoid these guys.
[250:01.18]Quick, say something like, yoinky!
[250:05.54]Hurry up, quick, say yoinky!
[250:14.95]Can I not parry?
[250:20.14]I don't think I can parry.
[250:21.40]I can't parry.
[250:22.00]I'm gonna go die.
[250:51.63]Okay, well, the cutscene's happening, so I can stop, right?
[250:54.01]Uh... You're so bad, you're losing to a basic enemy.
[251:01.49]I mean... who's that?
[251:16.49]my name is monsoon of the winds of destruction yeah I guessed as much here comes the meme alright yeah he just he's just tapping
[251:51.91]Raymond So that was the funny thing that was the thing that everyone's losing their minds about Does he say something feasting on the insides of your enemies?
[252:05.52]how easily you ignore the loss of life when it suits your convenience and
[252:10.97]So tell me, who saves the weak from the man who saves the weak?
[252:17.74]You're the ones exploiting them.
[252:20.98]You take advantage of their weakness.
[252:25.30]Of course they get hurt when you set them up as your human shield.
[252:31.20]Kill or be killed, Jack.
[252:36.25]Phnom Penh taught them that.
[252:40.80]Alright, where's the funny part?
[252:42.28]Is like a camera mode activated?
[252:44.30]Okay.
[252:44.50]Look right.
[252:44.94]I mean, there's people standing here.
[252:46.56]What do you mean look right?
[252:47.75]Look all the way right.
[253:09.84]They are the culture.
[253:11.17]They are everything we pass on.
[253:12.83]Keep looking.
[253:13.71]Expose someone to anger long enough?
[253:16.43]Huh?
[253:19.57]They become a carrier.
[253:21.23]Envy.
[253:22.17]Greed.
[253:23.07]Despair.
[253:24.21]Are you kidding me?
[253:26.97]Was I right?
[253:29.00]Was I actually right?
[253:30.08]Did the cat come back?
[253:32.44]Wind blows.
[253:33.72]Rain falls.
[253:35.20]And the strong prey upon the weak.
[253:40.74]If I had killed that cat, it wouldn't have happened, right?
[253:42.90]Something that saves lives.
[253:44.62]A means of justice.
[253:46.32]Now there's a pretty meme.
[253:47.82]Exquisite.
[253:50.42]It spared you the burden of all the lives.
[253:52.43]Did you just say that?
[253:53.71]Absolved you of guilt when you enjoyed it.
[254:01.09]That is until the illusion was broken.
[254:05.80]Don't be ashamed.
[254:07.36]It's only nature running its course.
[254:11.62]You have no choices to make, nothing to answer for.
[254:19.31]You can die with a clear conscience.
[254:25.33]The whole speech was about memes.
[254:27.87]About me, I mean.
[254:31.97]I knew something was off.
[254:34.91]How did I miss it?
[254:35.65]I was looking at the cat.
[254:36.29]I thought I could walk off the battlefield and into a normal life.
[254:39.17]I thought the cat was the meme.
[254:41.59]But here I am, surrounded by death, arguing philosophy with terrorists.
[254:47.16]I told myself this was about justice, about protecting the weak.
[254:51.82]But I was wrong.
[254:52.86]Look, when everybody is screaming, here comes the meme, here comes the meme, and a cat shows up on screen.
[254:59.08]That's the meme to me.
[255:00.78]You know what I'm saying?
[255:02.02]That's what the joke was.
[255:05.92]In America, my friends, my family, they helped me forget the devil inside.
[255:13.98]But who am I kidding?
[255:15.91]I was born to kill!
[255:20.95]The bit about my sword.
[255:23.23]That means of justice stuff.
[255:25.57]I guess I needed something to keep the Ripper in check when I was knee-deep in bodies.
[255:31.55]You?
[255:32.77]But you.
[255:34.43]All this is a wake-up call to what I really believe.
[255:39.04]What I really am.
[255:41.20]What are you saying?
[255:43.28]I'm saying Jack is back.
[256:03.29]Doctor, turn off my pain inhibitors.
[256:06.37]What?
[256:07.53]This... This is madness!
[256:09.91]You... Do it!
[256:12.39]Alright.
[256:12.91]Pain.
[256:13.85]This is why I fight.
[256:44.60]See, that's why I'm playing on normal.
[257:15.01]Who's next?
[257:21.24]I'll take this dance.
[257:23.20]Choose him.
[257:24.60]Report back to the chief.
[257:27.36]He's mine.
[257:33.38]You're the boss.
[257:35.62]I misjudged you.
[257:37.92]You are like us after all.
[257:41.19]Now you're just being nasty.
[257:46.93]That nickname you love so much.
[257:50.80]Wanna know how I got it?
[257:53.62]Actually, why don't I give you a demonstration?
[257:59.56]I can't win.
[258:00.70]You can't have it both ways, guys.
[258:02.22]Let her rip!
[258:04.59]Turbo, shut up during the cutscene!
[258:06.37]Why is he not talking?
[258:07.21]Where is he?
[258:09.33]What?
[258:14.29]Have us both!
[258:22.79]Oh, I need to pay attention.
[258:27.33]I got a perfect.
[258:32.09]There we go.
[258:44.44]Fuck!
[258:51.99]NOOO!
[258:53.09]Uh-oh, he's on my fucking head.
[259:03.54]Where'd he go?
[259:21.26]What does that mean?
[259:22.94]What does the thing on his head mean?
[259:24.74]He just grew a bigger forehead.
[259:27.03]What are you doing?
[259:29.19]What is it?
[259:30.69]A car!
[259:33.63]What?
[259:36.75]Do I... Okay.
[259:39.64]Slice the... Where are all these cars coming from?
[259:47.68]Okay, I get it.
[259:53.26]Where'd he go?
[259:53.54]Where'd he go?
[259:53.82]Where'd he go?
[259:54.10]Where'd he go?
[259:58.35]Alright, I have to block him.
[260:01.49]Shit.
[260:02.89]Nah, I gotta parry him.
[260:03.75]There's no way I'm gonna hit him.
[260:06.23]Right?
[260:06.53]Yeah, he's like cutting himself in half.
[260:09.07]Come on!
[260:09.63]Hit me!
[260:15.34]Fear the unseen much, Jack?
[260:17.68]Come on!
[260:23.56]I'm gonna, like, break my Xbox controller if I keep doing this shit.
[260:27.67]Seriously.
[260:31.83]I gotta be locked onto him.
[260:33.81]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[260:38.58]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[260:40.04]Did that work?
[260:48.28]I don't think that worked.
[261:15.42]Jesus.
[261:15.66]Did I get it?
[261:24.44]Chop him off.
[261:24.90]I win.
[261:25.45]What?
[261:25.87]What happened?
[261:26.87]Who's this?
[261:39.51]Damn it.
[261:48.04]There we go again.
[261:48.58]Alright.
[261:49.00]Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-cut it.
[261:51.64]Oh, there's so many things.
[261:52.80]How many more things do I have to cut?
[262:01.24]Did I get them all?
[262:02.84]I think so.
[262:05.40]Good.
[262:09.28]Whoops.
[262:16.83]Is that it?
[262:19.07]This guy's freaking me out, man.
[262:37.84]Alright, get it!
[262:38.58]Get the head!
[262:53.66]Alright, he's back into the weird mode again.
[262:58.02]More throwing shit?
[263:01.19]Oh no, it's a fucking Katamari.
[263:02.73]What do I do about the Katamari?
[263:08.75]What do I do about that?
[263:15.04]What do I do about this?
[263:16.22]I just dodged it.
[263:18.32]Uh-huh.
[263:32.96]Okay, I got it.
[263:34.30]Alright.
[263:40.75]I saw the flash.
[263:42.41]Get really- you fight me with your hand back there.
[263:44.61]Not fair.
[263:52.94]No, no, not this shit.
[264:09.14]I gotta get it perfect.
[264:11.50]It's not perfect, apparently.
[264:16.66]Should I... Should I slash him in the air?
[264:29.26]No, I'm ready to fight him.
[264:50.19]Where are you going?
[264:50.83]More of this bullshit.
[265:00.24]Oh god.
[265:08.88]AHH!
[265:11.18]I'm okay.
[265:19.35]Okay, easy.
[265:28.92]Free stuff.
[265:31.90]Can I cut him when he does that?
[265:39.40]Oh, I don't think so.
[265:44.87]Does he have to wait until he's done?
[265:46.69]He looks dead.
[265:50.46]Oh, he's trying to block.
[265:58.60]You, come here!
[266:09.83]Wow!
[266:10.59]Oh no, he's doing his final smash to me.
[266:25.96]Oh, I'm, like, fucking losing my mind.
[266:27.22]Ugh, my hands are sweaty.
[266:36.50]Whoops.

[266:37.59]It was really early, but I...
[266:52.37]Alright, come back down here dude.
[266:56.94]Oh no, he's gonna throw the giant missile at me now.
[267:05.02]What am I supposed to do?
[267:22.05]I guess this.

[273:31.50]Ooh, okay!
[273:32.88]Do I really need to do that right now?
[273:37.08]Oops.
[274:02.19]I guess it's kind of like Spider-Man, though, huh?
[274:08.32]You got in the way, you dick.
[274:11.22]Really?
[274:11.56]How is that not...?
[274:12.98]Okay, I'm a little bit confused here.
[274:15.66]I'm trying to figure out what happened.
[274:20.66]I'm trying to understand how that happened.
[274:24.63]Was I too far away?
[274:42.69]Alright, just two of these.
[274:49.00]You're off the screen.
[274:50.26]I'm gonna walk onto you.
[274:51.26]Whoa!
[274:51.78]Alright, I'm in ripper mode now.
[274:59.02]Uh, thank- that's great.
[275:05.45]Well, that was a good indicator of us.
[275:07.01]That was gone apparently.
[275:08.35]We just wasted it somehow.
[275:09.33]I got shot by like two rockets in a row.
[275:31.41]Yeah, it's unfortunate that I just upgraded this three times because I really don't like it Why did I do that?
[275:38.91]Thank you
[276:04.14]Classic waste-all-the-money joke.
[276:05.86]Well, it wasn't really a joke.
[276:06.86]I thought it was a melee weapon.
[276:10.35]I didn't think it was kind of this little, like, I thought it was replacing, um, because the staff replaced it with a melee weapon.
[276:35.67]The elevators appear to be disabled, which we should have expected, I suppose.
[276:41.70]I will access the controls.
[276:45.98]Okay.
[276:47.82]Alright, well, I can't... So, I might as well just use this.
[276:52.81]There's a guy already up here.
[277:15.98]Guys, there's a guy behind me.
[277:18.19]Is he just hitting me right now?
[277:19.27]Probably.
[277:32.41]Watch out for that.
[277:48.07]accidental arm I think it's inaccurate every time alright I really need to be using the car here is this guy behind a force field
[278:23.20]Alright, get me back on him.
[278:27.52]No, he's just out of reach.
[278:28.52]Can I shoot him in the feet and kill him?
[278:31.38]Come on.
[278:32.73]Why can't I aim it up like half an inch higher?
[278:34.97]Got it.
[278:43.07]He's still on the stairs.
[278:44.22]Is he even going to get up?
[278:58.25]Console FPF.
[279:05.25]Yes, that guy's shooting.
[279:09.05]Well, first you tell me don't leave the elevator and then you tell me go to the elevator and then you stop them from getting in the elevator.
[279:14.29]Get in the elevator!
[279:16.24]Stop talking to her in the cutscenes!
[279:17.24]The building is divided into upper and lower halves.
[279:20.25]The lower area consists of offices and meeting space for staff and visitors, while confidential military projects and technical research are restricted to the upper levels.
[279:30.33]So that's where the brains in the server room will be.
[279:32.87]Up top.
[279:33.93]Indeed.
[279:35.03]But that elevator can only access the lower floors.
[279:38.77]You need to get to the 20th floor and past the security gate there to reach the upper area.
[279:43.94]Let me guess.
[279:44.98]Time to find another left hand?
[279:47.27]Well, that is the problem.
[279:49.33]Security cyborgs would not have sufficient clearance.
[279:52.45]But managers and senior staff have already been evacuated, no doubt.
[279:56.57]So... The only option is to cut the power to the security gate, which will not be easy.
[280:03.48]It is powered by no less than three systems, including a backup power supply.
[280:07.82]You will need to destroy all of the electrical control panels to disable them.
[280:11.77]In any case, you should arrive at the 20th floor soon.
[280:15.15]Not a lot of grenades.
[280:19.53]The electrical panels are most likely hidden in the walls.
[280:22.84]Use your enhanced AR to search for any unusual heat sources inside the walls there.
[280:30.00]Unusual heat sources.
[280:32.58]Can I resolve this?
[280:35.94]Uh, alright, I guess I'm just going in.
[280:57.95]Well, I looked at it.
[280:58.65]There you go.
[281:13.72]Get out of the way!
[281:14.55]Give me my item that I just found!
[281:28.05]Give me my item!
[281:41.14]Oh, whoops!
[281:46.07]Okay.
[281:46.81]Look at my heat sources.
[281:57.20]The Rocket Launcher's gotta go.
[282:18.35]I know, because where did the dog come from?
[282:21.75]Why is there like a dog in here now?
[282:23.25]Oh my goodness gracious.
[282:35.42]Okay, I gotta run.
[282:36.43]Get away from me.
[282:40.45]Come on, really?
[282:53.40]What?
[282:53.80]Run now.
[282:54.66]What's going on?
[283:11.37]No we don't, no we don't!
[283:15.22]Too many people to parry!
[283:27.89]Too much going on!
[283:31.23]Oh boy, am I gonna die here?
[283:32.35]I think I'm dead here.
[283:33.82]I'm like, locked in the corner.
[283:43.82]Look Brock, I got other shit going on right now.
[283:46.64]I can't really do anything.
[284:12.89]I don't know where he's trying to get me to face, but... He's trying to get you to face the poster.
[284:38.33]That I'm not so sure about.
[284:45.88]Bunked out on my back, really.
[284:49.18]Alright.
[284:55.89]Now, where do I go?
[284:58.83]Look for the heat.
[285:02.65]Heat.
[285:03.45]Look for heat on the walls.
[285:08.61]There should be an electrical panel nearby.
[285:11.05]Use your enhanced AR to locate it.
[285:20.72]No, there's a box in here.
[285:25.90]Okay.
[285:28.08]Sure.
[285:29.72]Found it.
[285:30.69]Didn't I already see one of those?
[285:32.71]I thought I already tried to swing at one.
[285:34.03]People are coming in.
[285:52.76]Oh, no.
[285:54.52]Alright.
[285:56.18]One, two, three, let's, no, we gotta run.
[286:12.43]Error, error, AI error.
[286:13.79]Well, that was cool.
[286:39.80]Oh, that... That was not a pretty good... That was not a good telegraph right there.
[287:02.12]Still alive?
[287:11.22]I think he's dead.
[287:11.98]No, there are little worms in there.
[287:16.20]Alright, last one.
[287:33.41]Hmmm...
[287:39.16]I thought there was one back here, but I'm probably crazy.
[287:46.83]Well, there we go.
[287:58.41]That should take care of security.
[288:00.31]Now, head back to the gates.
[288:03.53]Enemy sighted!
[288:15.31]I was about to complain about how I didn't dodge that.
[288:19.81]But I did.
[288:46.68]Ayy, hooray.
[288:49.96]How much more of the game do I got?
[288:52.52]What's, uh, what's left?
[288:53.32]I feel like I'm getting fairly close.
[288:59.68]Like, an hour or two?
[289:08.96]I've got ten minutes left.
[289:10.44]I don't know about that.
[289:11.94]No, keep them off.
[289:14.48]I need it this way.
[289:16.49]Uh, well, as you wish.
[289:19.13]I must say, I have turned more than a few men into cyborgs.
[289:22.61]But you?
[289:23.79]Well, your past is most, uh... What you gettin' at, Doc?
[289:28.90]Most of the time, you're working with First World ex-military.
[289:32.12]Grown men.
[289:33.38]Compared to the average Third World child soldier, I can't really complain.
[289:37.96]Most of them.
[289:38.82]They're the sort of gorillas your typical patient gets paid to slaughter.
[289:42.76]Perhaps, but, uh... This shouldn't be news to you, Doc.
[289:46.74]No more vultures.
[290:14.91]I'm just gonna activate it.
[290:19.07]Fuck it, right?
[290:19.91]I should probably do a little tour after this, right?
[290:36.13]So, go, go, go!
[290:43.08]The guy told me to run, so I'm gonna run.
[291:01.12]For some reason, I thought he was talking about blow the door open.
[291:03.82]That's all I saw.
[291:13.54]Don't fight everybody, just go!
[291:14.50]I mean, I'll grab the RPG, but let's go.
[291:22.55]Oh, what?
[291:23.29]Can I?
[291:23.69]It's alright.
[291:24.53]I'm fine.
[291:24.97]I'm good.
[291:29.97]Why fight anything?
[291:30.68]Just run.
[291:52.73]Destroy the grab.
[291:54.99]Well, apparently I have to cut it.
[291:57.77]Ain't no going around it.
[292:12.29]You're really easy with the electrocution knife.
[292:14.25]What the hell is this thing?
[292:23.96]We'll get it again.
[292:25.30]We'll let go and then... Let go!
[292:28.68]Press again!
[292:30.20]It just sometimes fucks up when I do it.
[292:34.08]That was cool.
[292:51.28]Oh, I'm going to get hit right in the face by something.
[292:54.91]Ooh.
[292:58.47]I knew it.
[292:59.79]Yeah.
[293:00.01]Can I dodge?
[293:01.01]Is there a way I can, like, do it?
[293:04.72]What the fuck?
[293:05.42]Alright.
[293:05.74]Apparently, I did it.
[293:30.93]I got a D there.
[293:32.29]I didn't really do anything.
[293:33.65]I didn't really fight anybody.
[293:36.69]I couldn't really build points.
[293:38.63]You should find an indoor garden up ahead.
[293:41.19]A garden?
[293:42.28]Sounds fancy.
[293:43.64]A Japanese garden, to be precise.
[293:45.78]It is an area set aside for VIPs.
[293:48.78]Apparently, one of World Marshal's directors is a rather serious Japanese culture enthusiast.
[293:54.43]Alright.
[293:55.21]So what's this got to do with me?
[293:56.49]Is there something I need from the garden?
[293:59.09]Not at all.
[294:00.09]You need only pass through that area to arrive at a freight elevator.
[294:03.90]I found a route to the elevator controls through the unit we hijacked downstairs.
[294:08.82]I have located the server room as well.
[294:11.04]What am I seeing over here in the chat room?
[294:13.52]Great work, Doc.
[294:14.90]Elementary, my dear Raiden.
[294:16.86]Now, head for the garden.
[294:21.41]Any other stuff in there?
[294:28.33]Nope.
[294:33.88]Uhhh... Fight!
[294:41.01]Apparently... I don't know how the second one didn't hit.
[294:43.33]The second one should've hit.
[294:47.83]It should've.
[294:48.53]It should've.
[294:48.95]I'm trying to hit that guy too, but I can't.
[295:00.14]His... This guy's body was getting in the way.
[295:19.79]Die with the RPG is gonna go!
[295:20.83]You know what?
[295:29.57]Fuck it.
[295:29.81]Let's just do it.
[295:31.71]What?
[295:32.76]Nope.
[295:32.94]I got shot point blank by an RPG.
[295:35.12]Why are these guys down here?
[295:36.18]What the hell do you need to be doing that for?
[295:38.92]Why are you down here with an RPG?
[295:47.87]Well, he got tired.
[295:49.21]That works out for me.
[296:00.84]Too far away.
[296:01.50]Shit!
[296:19.69]I mean, wouldn't you say something similar at this point?
[296:25.89]Oh, fuck me!
[296:38.21]Proceed through the garden.
[296:42.50]They found you!
[296:59.84]The main exit is sealed.
[297:01.58]I very much doubt you can get through there.
[297:03.92]The catwalk above you is connected to a corridor made for transporting materials.
[297:08.40]There's a big guy over there.
[297:09.20]There's so many people here.
[297:09.91]You can take that to the elevator.
[297:14.11]I wonder what the hell I should do here.
[297:18.31]That's 5,000.
[297:18.59]Damn.
[297:18.89]Okay.
[297:19.13]Um...
[297:25.58]What's going on with that moon?
[297:28.14]That is... That is a very two-dimensional moon.
[297:31.94]Can I go this way?
[297:32.58]Well, I thought I could, but there was a weird invisible wall.
[297:37.38]Alright, I gotta say... What on Earth is with the stealth in this game?
[297:57.56]Oh, they're going up!
[298:33.78]Oh my god.
[298:40.90]No, I don't want... Why?
[298:42.46]Okay, it's targeting this guy.
[298:43.60]Well, why would it turn... Oh, whatever.
[298:59.85]I don't even know which way I'm going here.
[299:12.64]That was interesting.
[299:13.73]What should I use?
[299:21.85]I need to like do something here.
[299:45.75]Where is this camera even going?
[299:48.60]What is happening, man?
[299:50.24]Come on!
[299:51.80]Oh my fucking lord.
[299:53.22]Alright.
[299:57.72]Like, do I have to fight in these little corridors?
[299:59.57]That's all there is here.
[300:02.41]There's no open place I can... Like, over here is the biggest place, I think.
[300:21.69]Goodness gracious.
[300:25.47]No, don't do it!
[300:52.48]Just keep doing that same move.
[300:56.31]Oh my god, I'm gonna scream in a second here.
[301:01.44]Fuck off, both of you.
[301:19.30]How are you still alive?
[301:22.92]Now what just happened?
[301:55.24]Can I keep playing the game?
[301:56.44]Can I move on to another place?
[301:57.60]You guys took so long.
[302:00.56]Oh, I have to go up?
[302:12.34]Alright.
[302:13.61]I'll go this way.
[302:23.09]Am I crazy or something?
[302:28.47]What am I doing?
[302:32.71]There's something up here.
[302:38.81]That took too long.
[302:40.67]No, I don't have enough power!
[302:43.79]Shit.
[302:54.74]You don't need power?
[302:55.53]I thought you do.
[303:00.29]Oh, okay.
[303:00.65]Apparently you don't.
[303:06.82]Alright, follow the catwalk straight ahead to reach the elevator.
[303:16.66]My apologies, Raiden.
[303:18.33]I seem to have fallen behind.
[303:20.57]No worries.
[303:21.97]Actually, I should thank you.
[303:24.13]What are you talking about?
[303:25.89]If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have gotten Jack back.
[303:29.85]Then that is your true nature.
[303:33.46]More or less.
[303:35.02]Still interested?
[303:36.38]I find no reason to alter my objectives.
[303:39.56]From the moment we met, you have acted on emotional urges.
[303:43.80]You speak of protecting those weaker than you.
[303:46.64]Such people number in the billions.
[303:49.22]It is impossible.
[303:50.60]You cannot save every human being in the world.
[303:53.75]You cannot save every street child.
[303:56.63]After extended observation, I have come to a conclusion.
[304:01.17]Your actions are rooted in affinity for those from similar circumstances as yours.
[304:07.51]Guess so.
[304:08.99]Not much of a superhero after all, huh?
[304:11.76]However, your emotional status is understandable.
[304:15.86]Perhaps I share this same affinity.
[304:18.78]Well, if that's what you feel, then glad to have you along.
[304:22.82]Roger.
[304:24.21]You can reach the server room via the freight elevator just ahead.
[304:27.59]Press the button.
[304:43.93]Thought I blocked it.
[304:44.53]Cut the arm, cut the arm, cut the arm.
[305:06.17]Is it weird that my right hand hurts?
[305:09.05]I might have to take a break.
[305:24.28]No, it's all like the tap, flick, flick, tap, grab!
[305:26.66]Might deserve a little break.
[305:41.21]Use the claw grip?
[305:44.06]Oh, with a game like this?
[305:46.28]How are you supposed to claw grip it?
[305:51.46]No, it's a lot of this.
[306:09.98]And so... Fight!
[306:14.98]And get the super move.
[306:17.64]This part's gonna hurt your hand.
[306:19.35]Really?
[306:20.23]No, I don't want a part that it hurts by hand.
[306:21.97]Back it up again.
[306:35.76]I was trying to perfect parry it, but that didn't happen, I just got hit.
[306:39.53]Oh, this part's gonna hurt my fucking hand.
[306:41.21]Oh, fuck this elevator, seriously.
[306:47.95]Do I have to fight half the enemies in this game in these, like, tight-ass spaces?
[306:52.87]Really?
[306:55.28]This enemy's bigger than the screen, and it's a square where one of them can fit.
[307:04.53]Hold on a second.
[307:13.13]Let's go.
[307:16.03]Thank god he can't fall off.
[307:31.72]No, I didn't want to show it to him.
[307:33.17]I wanted to throw the grenade.
[307:36.13]I'm going to die here.
[307:45.68]I'm about to restart.
[307:54.52]Just kill me.
[307:54.94]I have to restart.
[307:55.56]I'm going to try again.
[307:57.91]Just kill me.
[308:00.12]Alright, let's go.
[308:39.72]Go sicko mode?
[308:40.46]No, no, no, no.
[308:41.08]I have to wait for those big guys to get here.
[308:51.33]I gotta take a break.
[308:52.71]This game is so much.
[308:58.89]This is like playing Dark Souls at times five speed.
[309:02.81]My brain is just slowing down.
[309:24.67]Get to the next boss.
[309:27.83]Well, if I can get off this elevator, we'll see.
[309:30.01]Maybe.
[309:38.64]Now I'm going to activate it.
[309:42.68]Did you just have cutscene hitbox immunity here?
[309:44.52]What the hell was that?
[309:56.40]God.
[310:05.79]Oof!
[310:06.31]Oh gosh, here comes another one of these assholes.
[310:34.66]It's a really tall building.
[310:40.04]Yeah, it is.
[310:44.17]No, don't do it.
[310:46.73]How did you get me?
[311:10.17]I don't even care about the mode here.
[311:19.40]Another one?
[311:28.09]I want to walk onto you!
[311:36.05]I might actually have to turn it on here, because I hate fighting the dogs.
[311:59.53]Stop running around!
[312:02.41]Come on!
[312:06.75]The one... You're not gonna do anything.
[312:08.79]The one time that I want you to.
[312:10.86]Come on, man.
[312:11.58]Alright.
[312:20.06]I just fat-fingered the whole entire control.
[312:25.51]Porn in chat, again?
[312:28.27]Well, I think that's strike three, guys.
[312:32.59]I think I'm gonna have to disable links permanently.
[312:55.40]Wait, am I being baited?
[312:57.64]Why would you bait me with that?
[312:59.31]Why would you tell me this porn in the chat?
[313:01.77]We've had an issue already.
[313:03.07]Why?
[313:03.31]Why?
[313:03.49]We've already had, like, an issue with that ship.
[313:22.91]They can't do this?
[313:24.57]Alright, just turn it off.
[313:25.77]I'm just mashing X right now.
[313:38.88]Alright, bye.
[313:47.76]How'd they have elevator sequence?
[313:53.84]How do I know what porn is?
[313:56.91]Uh... I went- I had a class.
[313:58.77]And the class talked about pornography.
[314:01.25]It was one of the things that they talked about.
[314:19.57]I don't even know what enemies are fighting me right now, but I know they're here, and they're flying around shooting missiles.
[314:25.09]There's three fucking vultures.
[314:26.83]Alright, it's time to fucking throw like a grenade or something.
[314:36.09]Holy shit, I just threw it over.
[314:37.73]I threw it overboard.
[314:39.41]What the hell, man?
[314:40.72]What are you even supposed to do about this reliably?
[314:44.40]Jesus, man.
[314:52.18]I don't even know what the fuck I'm gonna shoot at.
[314:53.64]Just shoot it, who cares?
[315:28.71]I hate these big guys.
[315:31.57]They're, like, actually the worst.
[315:36.61]Well, I got broken at that.
[316:19.25]Did I not block that?
[316:20.03]What?
[316:20.31]I don't even care.
[316:35.09]Just kill him.
[316:35.87]I'm going to be done with this mission.
[316:42.71]Anything else here?
[316:46.74]There was real... there was real porn.
[316:51.92]Why do we have to have this problem now, guys?
[316:54.76]I've had links in chat.
[316:57.32]For almost three or four years.
[316:58.86]The server room's ahead?
[316:59.90]Yes.
[317:01.00]And you're telling me that three years later.
[317:02.94]What did I expect to find?
[317:03.96]If they're VR training those brains, I'm guessing it won't look like your typical IT department.
[317:09.85]Quite right.
[317:10.93]Most of it will likely be occupied by life support units.
[317:14.29]Feeding oxygen and nutrition to the brains they have stored, you know.
[317:17.26]They would also need a server to feed them the VR data, but in terms of structure...
[317:22.87]It's really more brain storage and maintenance than a server.
[317:26.95]But no doubt it makes a convenient euphemism for what they are really doing there.
[317:31.40]Yeah, like how CIA agents refer to where they work as, the company.
[317:36.39]Indeed.
[317:37.33]Something like that would never arouse the suspicions of rank-and-file staff who may hear it.
[317:41.95]And I'm sure those complicit in this operation feel better not calling it the VR Training Room.
[317:48.11]Even something so simple as a name can help one ignore the truth of what they are doing.
[317:53.54]Truly fascinating how the human brain works.
[317:56.36]So this whatever room, that's where Sundowner's waiting, right?
[318:00.78]If he wants a fight, I wish he'd just get on with it.
[318:04.14]He didn't seem the type to run and hide.
[318:06.62]Well, he is in charge of security, but I suspect this is not about business.
[318:11.78]If I had to guess, I would say he is toying with you, testing you, perhaps.
[318:16.38]Whatever he's doing, it won't change what's going to happen once I finally catch up with him.
[318:22.07]Alright, so give me a second.
[318:23.59]I gotta, like, get a glass of water.
[318:25.07]I gotta take a break.
[318:26.45]I'll be back in, like, two minutes.
[318:28.15]I'm gonna pee, grab a jar of water.
[318:31.09]This game's, like, lighting my neurons up in my brain.
[318:38.60]No porn links in this chat!
[318:40.34]If I come back and there's a porn link, you're all in deep shit.
[318:46.34]Don't, don't do that.
[318:49.72]I'll be right back.
[322:07.07]Alright.
[322:07.73]Hello.
[322:07.95]I'm gonna change, like, the lighting in here.
[322:12.89]I think the lighting is, like, fucking with my head.
[322:14.79]I need to have, like, the ideal lighting.
[322:25.46]What's ideal lighting?
[322:29.66]I don't even know.
[322:36.16]Alright, hello.
[322:36.88]Yeah, I just needed to take a second.
[322:41.55]This game is... This game's a lot of fun.
[322:43.93]But... It's kind of like eye-melting.
[322:46.63]Because at some point it's just like... It fires off a lot of shit in the brain really fast.
[323:07.68]I think it's a good game.
[323:22.21]Brain can't take it.
[323:24.39]I think I'm good though.
[323:25.79]I just need to look away from it for like a minute or two.
[323:31.45]Grab some water, you know, chill.
[323:37.36]How do you think Sekiro is going to feel?
[323:40.02]Definitely a lot slower than this.
[323:46.12]But I don't know.
[323:46.90]It's kind of in the same realm as the other games, right?
[323:53.92]I think the sound design makes it really overwhelming.
[323:57.86]Yeah, we'll see if I can do the whole game.
[324:17.72]Uh... Okay.
[324:18.94]Well, got it.
[324:21.94]They're all getting back on top of her head.
[324:34.55]I gotta kill them all before they get back.
[324:36.25]She has like a... Okay, this is... I don't know what the hell's happening, but... I'll take it.
[324:41.01]I'll take the victory.
[324:45.47]BD!
[324:45.75]BD!
[324:49.56]So I gotta fight this boss.
[324:50.62]This isn't like a boss rush, is it?
[324:52.28]This is a boss rush room or something.
[324:55.89]Weird.
[325:06.87]Don't let her get it.
[325:07.55]I hope you're like... You don't have any weapons on.
[325:09.63]You don't have any like...
[325:23.40]Don't let her get a ball.
[325:37.01]There you go.
[325:49.77]No, no, no, no.
[325:50.47]Don't let her get away.
[326:00.13]Only two bosses and it is a boss rush.
[326:04.09]Yeah.
[326:05.35]Still... Still a rush.
[326:07.71]Still a boss rush.
[326:10.04]Rush.
[326:13.84]Okay, all I need to do is some water.
[326:21.46]Do you understand?
[326:24.12]The whole hydrate meme thing, I understand it now.
[326:26.60]You gotta... I was turning into... I was shriveling up there.
[326:44.04]Can you come back down, lady?
[326:46.56]Hey, lady!
[326:47.34]No, you missed.
[327:07.32]Alright, gotta get a good block.
[327:08.58]Block it!
[327:09.32]Do something.
[327:21.47]What are you doing?
[327:21.95]Why are you standing still?
[327:22.89]0.0.0.1%.
[327:24.01]Got it.
[327:24.93]Now what?
[327:25.55]Ooh, stop.
[327:41.66]Oh, it is a boss brush.
[327:43.72]That was a stupid joke I was making, and it really is.
[327:53.69]Oh my lord, I didn't drink enough water for this shit.
[327:57.14]I got four health things, I'll be fine.
[328:07.37]God.
[328:11.33]It's alright.
[328:28.32]He's faster than last time.
[328:31.27]He is much faster than last time.
[329:01.14]Head off, go get the head.
[329:22.24]Whoo!
[329:32.14]Oh, not the foot versus feet.
[329:51.91]Got it.
[329:53.31]Oh, I didn't- whatever.
[329:54.01]I didn't get like a super cool kill, but I still did it.
[330:08.52]Alright.
[330:13.52]Blade Mode does less damage?
[330:14.74]I don't want to miss anything.
[330:22.08]People get really mad when I miss something.
[330:23.64]And I'm sorry!
[330:24.31]I'm sorry I do.
[330:25.89]I just... I'm sorry.
[330:28.01]This thing's up there.
[330:35.69]Blade Mode is not meant for dealing damage.
[330:40.19]You know, I use Blade Mode because it makes me feel safe.
[330:43.59]But it's so slow.
[330:44.41]Is this fighting this guy now?
[330:46.47]You missed a diamond.
[331:07.97]Doing it virtually, though?
[331:10.11]No fuss, no muss.
[331:12.43]Straight to the brain.
[331:15.22]It's like a dream.
[331:17.70]Well, maybe dream is the wrong word.
[331:21.76]They do kill some POWs, some civilians.
[331:27.93]They enjoy it, though.
[331:29.85]We give their pleasure centers nice big choked every time.
[331:35.55]Plus, they get a shiny new body as a graduation present.
[331:39.86]Wait, did I just skip the whole thing?
[331:43.18]Another thing you have in common.
[331:46.56]I chose this.
[331:48.10]They're kids, you son of a bitch.
[331:51.25]And kids creep.
[331:54.52]No, don't make me laugh.
[331:55.60]Don't make me laugh.
[331:57.04]They just lose touch with it as they get older.
[331:59.58]Start thinking they know right and wrong.
[332:02.58]That's immoral.
[332:04.43]War crime this, code of conduct that.
[332:08.01]Kids, you can mold.
[332:10.91]Manipulate it to perform in all kinds of atrocities.
[332:15.05]And there's nothing like a good atrocity to keep a war going.
[332:19.75]That's why I'm shutting you down.
[332:24.09]You just don't see the bigger picture, do you?
[332:32.73]Say you bring this whole place down.
[332:36.96]Waltz out of the rubble with all these precious brains.
[332:41.90]Nothing changes.
[332:47.30]Which one of these Harry Potter things do I have to find in the fourth movie?
[332:51.18]This is kind of creepy.
[333:15.99]Did you think every battle in history was all part of some big ol' conspiracy?
[333:22.99]Bullshit!
[333:24.45]War is just part of who we are.
[333:26.58]Why fight it?
[333:29.34]Anyway, none of this will matter in three hours.
[333:33.10]Demand for PMCs is about to skyrocket.
[333:36.60]Like the good ol' days after 9-11!
[333:41.00]What are you talking about?
[333:42.18]Not here.
[333:45.56]Follow me.
[333:48.51]Okay.
[333:52.01]Raiden, get Sundowner.
[333:53.97]Do not lose him this time.
[333:56.37]Don't lose him.
[333:58.54]But, wait.
[334:01.30]I'm gonna have to lose him for a second, because... There's items over there, boss.
[334:06.78]I'd like to get them.
[334:17.42]Is there more than one?
[334:18.22]Wasn't there one?
[334:20.86]There's another one over there.
[334:23.42]Can I just cut through the door?
[334:25.32]Uh... I don't think I have enough... If I go customize right now...
[334:48.88]Where's it gonna put me?
[334:54.32]Will it put me back right here?
[335:07.15]How do I get that out of the chest?
[335:08.25]It's gonna ball to me.
[335:10.15]Alright, well I'll upgrade because I feel like I'm probably getting close to one of the second to last areas.
[335:19.78]Hopefully, this don't put me all the way back.
[335:37.57]Bird up.
[335:38.95]Why did I read that?
[335:51.26]Okay.
[335:56.56]Fuel cells.
[335:58.55]They're all good.
[335:59.25]I'm gonna go to skills, though, because this is a bunch that I don't have.
[336:02.65]Sweep kick, thunder strike.
[336:07.03]Cyborg body for another turn.
[336:10.31]Mmm, polearm.
[336:17.22]Falling lightning.
[336:21.47]Diving down into air.
[336:29.29]My weapon.
[336:29.79]200,000.
[336:32.23]I don't even have enough.
[336:37.24]Strength.
[336:38.04]Plus 3.
[336:38.68]How much is this?
[336:41.38]16,000?
[336:41.48]I'm just going to upgrade this a few times.
[336:50.77]Really need it.
[336:53.59]Then I have enough for one of the skills, right?
[337:00.89]Thunderstrike.
[337:03.81]Channel air pressure into a shockwave.
[337:05.91]Uh, sure.
[337:07.47]And... Sweep kick?
[337:14.41]Yeah.
[337:14.53]Alright, let me see what this does.
[337:29.20]Raiden, get Sundowner.
[337:30.92]Do not lose it this time.
[337:32.28]Alright, hold on.
[337:34.22]Let me just take a look on the list.
[337:37.62]Thunderstrike.
[337:40.49]This is left stick.
[337:42.93]Up, down, X. Okay.
[337:52.91]What about the other one?
[337:59.60]Sky High is up, up, X. Did I get any others?
[338:05.52]I got Sweep, right?
[338:10.20]I think I've done this accidentally a couple of times.
[338:12.68]Blade.
[338:29.71]How do I pick... There we go.
[338:31.34]Stabbing Despair.
[338:33.92]And then after Throw Dash, I mean, it's just... There's only two moves.
[338:41.22]Take off the side.
[338:42.06]Yeah, bye.
[338:44.13]Yeah.
[338:44.57]Do I have enough to upgrade the other weapon?
[338:53.59]No, I only have 2,000.
[338:54.07]Never mind.
[338:58.04]I thought, for some reason, I thought I had 20,000.
[339:01.06]Never mind.
[339:01.44]Uh, should I... No, I could just go to none, right?
[339:28.49]Alright, here we go!
[339:37.22]Make sure I didn't miss anything.
[339:38.08]I'm so paranoid about that.
[339:47.44]Okie dokie.
[339:48.38]We need to go up here.
[339:52.52]Well, that would be nice if you could do the whole thing.
[340:02.25]How's this, Jack?
[340:20.73]We can play up here without damaging the merchandise.
[340:24.47]What happens in three hours?
[340:27.74]Who the hell was that that just was talking?
[340:30.30]Was that- that was a joke tape.
[340:36.01]What happened to three hours?
[340:41.59]Fuck, I don't want to hear that again.
[340:47.81]This whole game is a joke tape.
[340:49.71]I thought I was back.
[340:56.10]Solar panels.
[340:56.76]That's how he stays charged.
[340:59.52]Okay.
[340:59.74]I'll try it.
[341:22.57]Wow.
[341:22.95]He just plated me.
[341:29.94]Good.
[341:37.71]Helicopter back there is kind of a problem, I think.
[341:48.67]Alright, I'll keep my blade away from the shield.
[341:52.50]Can I cut the shields off?
[341:54.50]Can I chop the shields off?
[342:00.46]What else?
[342:06.02]Oh, alright, so when he does that... When he does that, I have to chop through him.
[342:10.92]I see.
[342:12.37]Okay, well... Alright, um, does it have to be a helicopter here?
[342:22.05]Like, why is this here?
[342:23.17]It's just to be annoying, isn't it?
[342:25.26]No, I wanna shoot it.
[342:26.76]Can I just get rid of this thing?
[342:33.46]How are we going to do this?
[342:37.04]There's nothing out of here.
[342:50.36]Alright, let's go.
[342:52.76]Alright, after I do that, he... Do I not hit him again after that?
[343:09.47]I'm fucking invincible!
[343:12.13]I'm right behind him!
[343:35.09]Oh, god damn it.
[343:51.41]No, alright, get that thing out of here again.
[343:52.95]Part two.
[344:06.26]I don't know, whatever.
[344:08.36]I'm just gonna try to figure out what the hell I'm doing wrong here.
[344:28.35]Oh, you didn't get it, huh?
[344:32.17]He can't do anything.
[344:33.01]He's invincible.
[344:34.07]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[344:35.11]I wanted to press down.
[344:40.29]Alright.
[344:44.26]So why is it not giving me the... I'm really confused.
[344:48.50]Because he's invincible.
[344:51.32]I cut through one.
[344:52.50]Alright.
[344:52.82]I cut through one.
[344:53.66]Am I going to get the indicator again?
[344:58.15]No.
[344:58.37]Is the head in the head?
[344:59.35]Or...
[345:12.46]I can't even do it.
[345:16.20]Goddammit.
[345:16.86]I'm just like, a brain like I told you before.
[345:22.48]Alright, do it.
[345:23.34]Here we go, okay?
[345:25.05]Now I gotta cut here.
[345:27.01]I mean, I... The fucking right stick.
[345:31.91]Yeah.
[345:35.12]I gotta get it next time.
[345:36.09]I just... I don't have enough clue.
[345:41.59]I pressed, like, right stick and it was like, and like, flipped all over the place.
[345:45.49]That might as well just die and do it again.
[345:48.29]I'll do it this time next time.
[345:49.85]Come on!
[346:05.39]Uh, do I have legal bills?
[346:06.43]I know.
[346:06.91]You're not gonna be on the helicopter.
[346:09.79]Yeah.
[346:09.89]I'll just do it again.
[346:11.29]Alright.
[346:11.89]Die, you stupid helicopter.
[346:18.10]You're here for no reason.
[346:25.52]I mean, maybe it was, like, part of the fight or something.
[346:33.02]No.
[346:33.50]It's just here.
[346:39.90]No, I hit fucking X. Why?
[346:42.91]I just pressed X and I didn't... Gamer fatigue is setting in.
[346:47.89]Like, just straight up gamer fatigue.
[346:54.45]What is this fucking swing here?
[347:15.72]Really?
[347:17.94]I did not want it the first time.
[347:25.45]Where am I?
[347:26.87]What the fuck?
[347:36.55]This is so easy.
[347:37.73]This is the easiest boss fight in the whole entire fucking game.
[347:41.12]And just me aiming with the right stick somehow is impossible.
[347:51.52]Like, I'm so close to him.
[347:53.52]What the fuck?
[348:01.92]Like, look at how close this is.
[348:03.42]Come on.
[348:14.34]Again, why does it have to put me right here?
[348:24.45]He's trying to not hit.
[348:25.47]No, I'm not.
[348:26.13]I just play this game for six hours.
[348:27.87]It just drains your body.
[348:30.45]What else do you want me to do?
[348:56.00]Oh god damn, he's back.
[348:57.86]Fucking helicopter here.
[349:11.55]What the fuck?
[349:15.81]This guy seriously is... oh, you're gonna do this?
[349:24.61]What are you doing with that, man?
[349:36.09]I'll be back.
[349:37.59]So that is part of the game.
[349:46.97]Part of the fight.
[350:11.61]This is another run on the side of the building.
[350:13.41]I'm gonna be very very fly along the side to build That hurt
[350:48.23]I guess I'll come in.
[350:48.95]I thought it was gonna be one cut!
[350:52.58]I thought it was gonna be one cut!
[350:54.62]Come on, get me in!
[350:59.52]Alright, I made it.
[351:10.63]No!
[351:25.60]I don't want anyone to recognize it It's over it is What happens in three hours
[351:55.04]Who say?
[351:56.54]Who?
[351:57.44]Armstrong.
[351:58.86]I already said too much.
[352:03.89]I have a call to make.
[352:07.67]Got yourself shaving?
[352:09.27]Asshole.
[352:12.89]He's good.
[352:18.85]Real good.
[352:20.94]You knew this would happen.
[352:27.77]Well, you get your wish.
[352:32.51]Up to you now.
[352:34.11]Sell!
[352:37.55]Final boss incoming.
[352:38.77]Raiden here.
[352:39.73]I've taken Marshal HQ.
[352:42.77]I have just entered the airspace.
[352:44.23]I will be there soon.
[352:45.89]Hurry!
[352:47.32]Raiden, what Sundowner said?
[352:50.38]I know.
[352:51.38]Anything that'll rival 9-11 cannot be good.
[352:54.30]And in three hours, maybe less.
[352:57.41]He said even Mach 2 could not get there in time.
[352:59.93]If he was serious, that's over 4,000 miles away.
[353:04.41]4,500.
[353:05.01]So whatever it is, it's not happening on American soil.
[353:08.36]If it's going to spike demand for PMCs, it's got to be a political hotspot.
[353:12.30]A coup or civil war in a stable region wouldn't have a domino effect.
[353:15.74]And they'd want to draw in a superpower.
[353:18.90]No.
[353:21.40]The President.
[353:22.80]He's on his way to Pakistan.
[353:24.90]If something happens to him there... Oh, shit!
[353:28.22]The War on Terror Part 2.
[353:30.66]Contact the military.
[353:32.40]Official channels are frozen since Mexico.
[353:34.92]Unofficial channels will take too long.
[353:37.02]Besides, what's our proof?
[353:38.80]Who's gonna believe us over World Martian?
[353:40.96]Then we have to get there first.
[353:42.81]Neva's Mushna.
[353:43.75]Impossible!
[353:44.95]It is the other side of the planet.
[353:46.85]Even if we were in the world's fastest jet right now, it's not even close.
[353:52.84]Can one of you guys come and get me?
[353:53.96]It's fast.
[353:55.92]It's really fast.
[354:23.79]B-A-D-A-C-V-C-S-A-V.
[354:27.27]That's all over the place.
[354:29.15]I took that test drunk.
[354:47.08]Custom cyborg party.
[354:48.10]Okay.
[354:51.54]I got his weapons and his armor.
[355:04.06]How much is it?
[355:12.19]Custom cyborg, 15,000.
[355:13.85]So what's the difference here?
[355:23.81]I don't have enough to do that.
[355:27.09]Just a different color?
[355:31.81]Well, what's the weapon?
[355:38.62]Pinsir Blades.
[355:40.38]A pair of giant, high-frequency machetes that can be combined to form massive shears.
[355:44.98]Difficult to follow in motion, they are particularly effective at catching their prey off-guard.
[355:50.40]Developed after careful analysis of Sundowner's battle data.
[355:56.13]10,000.
[356:03.30]Not good.
[356:04.06]I wonder if they're good.
[356:04.74]I want to try it.
[356:07.16]Just want to see.
[356:11.00]I'm not going to put the upgrades on it yet, but I am going to even know I'm not because it's 40,000.
[356:14.46]Hmmm.
[356:27.89]Turbulence.
[356:28.51]I don't have enough.
[356:32.21]I need to level up.
[356:52.26]Cargo's all set to go, sir.
[356:54.10]Excellent.
[356:54.94]Commencing takeoff in semi-auto mode.
[356:59.39]A man of many talents.
[357:08.34]You know, this kind of space launch once required days of preparation.
[357:12.68]Solus has been conducting test flights almost every day for the last six months.
[357:16.84]As long as we're not breaking atmosphere, they said they can reroute today's flight no problem.
[357:21.76]Amazing.
[357:22.82]The Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever.
[357:27.95]Uh oh.
[357:28.13]It's Sam.
[357:55.78]This is a transport chopper.
[357:57.50]Our defensive options are limited.
[357:58.94]I didn't say Sam.
[357:59.54]I said Sam.
[358:02.50]With a capital M. Missiles incoming.
[358:18.61]EMP?
[358:19.57]Yes, but not strong enough to take out the drone.
[358:33.77]I'll handle this.
[358:35.45]Alright, then.
[358:37.70]Have a nice flight.
[358:40.44]And people say Germans aren't funny.
[358:44.68]When did they say that?
[358:46.14]What?
[358:46.38]Are you even messing with me?
[359:02.35]One guy said that.
[359:03.93]There it is.
[359:10.42]Alright, bring the chopper around.
[359:48.53]It's easy to rain.
[359:55.41]Okay, I'm coming back.
[360:00.19]This is easier said than done, you know.
[360:02.95]Who's the final level?
[360:16.22]Yeah sure.
[360:17.10]Yeah sure.
[360:17.72]Yeah sure.
[360:58.41]I gotta get out of here.
[360:59.77]Sorry, my friend.
[361:01.93]Your sacrifice will not be forgotten.
[361:13.34]That was quite the fall, Raiden.
[361:15.50]I'm glad to see that you are alright.
[361:17.64]It's time you got out of Denver.
[361:19.32]Enemy sighted!
[361:22.38]Enemy!
[361:28.79]The rest is Spleen out.
[361:31.07]I'll take it.
[361:31.49]Now you play as a doctor.
[361:36.23]Wouldn't that be something?
[361:39.86]If there wasn't a guy behind me, I would've got that guy in one hell's will.
[361:46.06]I'm not even getting the right guy here.
[361:59.02]Use Pinscher?
[361:59.62]Well, I didn't really get a chance to go into my menu.
[362:02.54]I kind of got attacked immediately.
[362:04.96]Oops.
[362:07.04]Oops.
[362:07.90]Oops.
[362:13.39]Okay.
[362:17.25]So it is on.
[362:25.26]They can charge up.
[362:26.10]There's a slow.
[362:26.80]Can people stop calling me?
[362:28.10]Like, can't you talk to me on the move?
[362:29.30]Yeah.
[362:29.58]Shouldn't take more than two hours with a set of wheels.
[362:32.10]Guess I'll just have to borrow some.
[362:33.10]A lot of cars got abandoned when the evac order came down.
[362:51.26]But won't the roads be blocked?
[362:53.46]If you are struck by one of those missiles, or... I know.
[362:57.19]Let me just worry about putting some distance between me and World Marshal, and what's left of it.
[363:04.97]Now, you could have emailed that to me.
[363:07.49]I'm a $20 billion cyber ninja, okay?
[363:12.61]You can email me that, and it'll just download into my brain, and I won't even need to hear you talk.
[363:29.70]Oh my, okay, well, I'm turning this shit on.
[363:39.61]And that whole animation lasts too long to the point where now I gotta fight this dude.
[363:49.08]Why does he want to do that?
[364:20.26]Oh, get off the walk-on there.
[364:21.32]Come on, get off that walk-on.
[364:26.52]Well, I... Those are very slow, aren't they?
[364:48.59]Get closer and cut it off.
[364:51.48]Right now you're in big trouble.
[364:59.74]I only have two heals.
[365:01.72]That's not good.
[365:13.61]Melt.
[365:23.32]I'm not sure I like these.
[365:30.39]These might be too slow in a game that's this fast.
[365:36.55]It's kind of hard to use them.
[365:41.13]Where's my AR?
[365:47.15]Gotta charge it.
[365:47.73]Yeah.
[366:01.04]I couldn't even do it.
[366:01.66]I just tried to do it, you heard it.
[366:06.23]My voice just got cracked right there.
[366:26.97]Oh, Jeremy!
[366:27.88]You got it.
[366:30.87]You got the arm on purpose.
[366:32.55]I tried.
[366:41.79]Actually, here's why those things are not terrible.
[366:44.71]Because they can hit more than one person at a time.
[366:47.61]Nice work, Jeremy.
[366:52.98]You did a great job.
[366:55.56]I'm doing fine.
[366:56.26]It's okay.
[366:56.54]You know?
[367:19.79]Jeremy makes less jokes than he enjoys a game.
[367:24.66]I don't know if, it's just hard to talk and play at the same time.
[367:30.40]You know what I mean?
[367:32.86]When there's a bunch of enemies on screen, it's like jump, jump, jump, dash, jump.
[367:38.81]I can't be like, I was at the grocery store yesterday, and let me tell you something.
[367:42.39]You have to pay attention.
[367:51.34]Hates game?
[367:52.08]What?
[367:53.20]When did you hear that?
[367:55.13]When did I say hate game?
[367:58.25]I would not be streaming and playing this game for more than six hours if I hated the game.
[368:03.20]What?
[368:05.00]No.
[368:06.99]I think it's fun.
[368:08.38]I wouldn't be playing it if I didn't think that.
[368:12.02]And by the way, let me tell you something.
[368:13.64]I went to the movies yesterday, right?
[368:14.68]I went to go see Infinity War for like the 34th time.
[368:18.56]I saw Infinity War for every single year that I've been live because I had to.
[368:23.26]And I'm in line.
[368:24.64]And let me tell you something.
[368:25.96]Popcorn?
[368:26.86]Fucking expensive.
[368:28.31]Why?
[368:28.93]It's like the airlines.
[368:30.33]You know what I mean?
[368:31.55]When you go to the movie theater, essentially you go into an entertainment airline.
[368:35.29]You know what I mean?
[368:43.15]They charge so much, but here's the difference.
[368:45.13]Alright, I gotta stop that.
[368:50.35]Somebody just said shut up.
[368:51.63]You see?
[368:54.03]You know what I mean?
[368:54.61]You know what I mean?
[368:55.95]You know what I mean?
[368:56.46]You know what I mean?
[369:00.64]One guy said that.
[369:01.54]Yeah, but there's still one guy that's angry that I just did that.
[369:04.50]Activate the VAT system.
[369:07.12]Every time I activate this, I fall down.
[369:24.50]Stop talking.
[369:25.55]You guys are gonna have to have, like, a vote amongst yourselves here.
[369:34.71]Jerma, talk.
[369:35.37]Jerma, don't talk.
[369:36.41]Hey, you, shut up.
[369:37.54]Be quiet.
[369:38.30]Why aren't you talking?
[369:39.56]We're the jokes.
[369:41.82]Pay attention!
[369:43.86]Do we have, like, a poll in chat here?
[369:55.38]I hate you guys so much.
[369:56.92]No, no, no.
[370:01.35]I'm talking about... Ow, my stomach.
[370:05.51]I'm talking about these enemies.
[370:08.37]Ow.
[370:09.77]I'm talking about the enemies.
[370:11.00]I just hurt myself.
[370:12.84]I'm talking about the enemies, the vultures.
[370:22.12]I'm not talking about you guys.
[370:32.67]No.
[370:33.83]The stupid fucking vulture guy.
[370:35.85]I hate them.
[370:40.41]He called us vultures.
[370:43.43]Oh.
[370:45.02]Let me see that clip.
[370:49.20]I want to hear how fucking bad that was.
[370:51.58]That probably sounded so bad.
[370:55.26]Ugh.
[370:57.40]I hate you guys so much.
[370:59.66]Oh no.
[371:02.34]No, you didn't, they gotta get the whole thing there.
[371:07.47]Ugh.
[371:10.77]I'm losing viewers now.
[371:12.57]That's not what I meant, you all know it, come on.
[371:17.01]Holy shit, that was badly played.
[371:25.32]Wait, are people actually leaving because they thought I, that's what I was saying?
[371:31.68]No.
[371:42.79]No, don't do it, don't do it
[372:09.64]Somewhere there's somebody that really thought, because I did just say the thing about like chat and stuff, and like how, what do you want me to do, and, oh, that came out so bad.
[372:18.20]All the fucking vultures and stuff.
[372:21.22]You know what I'm talking about.
[372:29.76]You got a Dragon Ball Z hat, bro.
[372:41.75]In face.
[372:43.33]Alright, now don't fuck this up.
[372:45.11]It's gonna go up.
[372:47.41]And do it again.
[372:49.75]We need an apology statement.
[372:54.23]Well, I'm sorry.
[372:56.93]That you may have thought that's what I said.
[372:59.45]It's not what I said.
[373:09.98]Wait, cut car in half.
[373:10.92]Doesn't make you happy, right?
[373:19.48]Can't even cut the car in half.
[373:20.82]How am I supposed to make everybody happy?
[373:22.03]Nice non-apology.
[373:31.09]That's making me laugh.
[373:32.11]You remember when I said I hated these enemies?
[373:48.68]Look at me now.
[373:57.46]I've come to have a lot of respect for you.
[373:59.22]You know what I mean?
[374:05.76]I got two here.
[374:06.40]The whole point of this segment is to show how much better you are now.
[374:23.23]I mean, I feel like I improved a lot.
[374:27.75]That's the whole point, right?
[374:30.53]Top number one.
[374:32.95]video game player.
[374:35.01]You gotta get the muscle memory, you gotta fucking drink some water, you gotta accidentally press L2 twice, by the way.
[374:41.43]Twice.
[374:52.84]Yep.
[374:59.34]Who's still around?
[375:00.37]Who's this?
[375:02.73]What?
[375:04.55]Really?
[375:05.33]Well, now I'm gonna fucking mutilate him!
[375:12.86]That clip is gonna haunt me for the next six years.
[375:18.74]People are gonna take the whole clip and they're gonna be like, look what he said!
[375:21.02]Like, can you believe this shit?
[375:28.25]You have escaped the pursuit?
[375:29.91]Seems like it.
[375:31.23]You have passed the last of the barricades.
[375:33.19]Save your strength.
[375:34.17]Find a vehicle.
[375:35.89]Right.
[375:42.65]That should do nicely.
[375:49.11]Fuck.
[375:56.54]Watch the actual clip.
[375:57.80]Like, the full one.
[375:58.88]Does somebody have a full one?
[376:11.93]Nice chapter, okay?
[376:13.97]The truth comes out.
[376:14.95]Let's see.
[376:15.78]Is this the right one?
[376:18.02]Like a pole?
[376:19.66]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[376:20.80]I gotta hear how bad this is.
[376:22.10]Let me just... The whole thing.
[376:23.26]Can I have like a pole in chat here?
[376:35.61]I hate you guys so much.
[376:37.13]No, no, no!
[376:50.61]It's not, it's just the fact that it's... It's too late.
[376:54.10]It's too late for me.
[376:56.48]It's too late.
[376:58.30]It's really so bad.
[377:09.89]There it is, the career's over.
[377:13.35]That's it.
[377:13.87]I wanna use these.
[377:21.60]I feel like I could use these if I start to actually play.
[377:25.37]I want the skill with them, too.
[377:26.71]Where's the skill?
[377:28.01]Turbulence.
[377:28.49]Right here.
[377:43.21]Um... This can follow up a slash with a powerful downward strike.
[377:51.50]I'll get it.
[377:52.06]Ooh, there's another one.
[377:53.52]Downburst.
[377:55.10]So that was at... YY?
[378:05.83]I may have run out of... points here.
[378:14.23]Yeah.
[378:14.61]Okay.
[378:15.03]You can charge the second hit as well.
[378:19.35]That's pretty cool.
[378:24.36]I don't have enough for the mariachi.
[378:49.33]What the devil?
[378:50.99]That guy's face seriously looks like the Scream mask.
[378:54.08]Does he get a full letter grade?
[378:55.16]Do I get to ride the motorcycle?
[379:25.90]Right.
[379:39.63]Having a little heart to heart?
[379:41.70]I have analyzed his words and actions.
[379:45.14]I am unable to ascertain his motivation.
[379:52.10]Fancy meeting you here.
[379:54.30]You knew I'd come.
[379:56.40]I suppose I should thank you for not killing everyone at the launch site.
[380:03.13]Well, not if you say it like that.
[380:04.61]I just want a Mack truck to drive down the road.
[380:08.65]You're not very good at your job.
[380:11.58]The war is the big payoff.
[380:15.50]Right.
[380:16.18]Big raises all around once World Marshal gets all those contracts.
[380:21.82]I'm not talking about money, Jack.
[380:26.13]I'm talking ideals.
[380:28.39]Excuse me.
[380:31.31]Forget it.
[380:32.55]We've both heard enough speeches about higher causes by now.
[380:37.31]History will decide who's right.
[380:41.93]End of story.
[380:44.86]I hope he just starts doing that with his mouth.
[381:02.74]Is the dog the referee?
[381:06.46]I don't care who thinks I'm right.
[381:09.32]And I've got cause enough for killing you.
[381:12.52]Huh?
[381:13.72]Oh, good.
[381:14.16]Having a clean fight.
[381:15.98]Why, that's very good.
[381:17.44]Regardless of who wins.
[381:18.28]Yes, I like that.
[381:21.09]Must you really fight?
[381:29.47]Don't interfere.
[381:37.33]This is between us Come on It's here, okay, that's some music right dance

[382:37.24]Well, that took a long time.
[382:42.99]Oh, that's tough.
[382:43.81]That's tough to do.
[382:45.07]That's tough to do.
[382:46.68]Activate!
[382:47.35]Oh, I'm just getting embarrassed with my superpowers on.
[383:07.06]Oh boy.
[383:18.49]I don't want to use that move.
[383:20.07]Got his hand off!
[383:33.65]Oh my goodness, I did it!
[383:34.95]No I didn't.
[383:37.87]Show me a good time, Jack!
[383:43.80]Why are you better without your sword?
[383:47.84]I was mistaken.
[383:56.75]I tried to block it and it didn't block it!
[384:02.81]I got a perfect this morning.
[384:04.89]It's the easiest thing to block and I keep fucking it all up.
[384:07.85]Got it.
[384:08.27]Finally.
[384:08.79]What?
[384:10.39]Wait.
[384:11.87]He's harder for me without the sword.
[384:15.12]Calm down.
[384:15.64]I have to get a perfect.
[384:20.76]That's what the problem is.
[384:27.89]You're a waste of money.
[384:34.71]Not perfect.
[384:35.83]Perfect.
[384:38.09]Oh my goodness.
[384:40.63]This guy is just fucking embarrassing.
[384:44.29]On my own livestream.
[385:06.84]Gotta just get up and close and fucking block.
[385:09.50]What do I do?
[385:14.06]What do I do?
[385:14.82]Yeah, and... He's gonna get his sword.
[385:52.08]Ooh, he broke it.
[385:52.83]Not good enough.
[385:58.02]Say goodnight.
[386:37.57]Ooh, I'll get it this time.
[386:38.33]Ah.
[386:38.47]Damn it, the fucking kick.
[387:21.38]Do something!
[387:33.61]Oh no!
[387:34.31]That's the first time I've seen him do that move!
[387:36.23]Fuck, this is worse than last time.
[387:44.08]Isn't it?
[387:56.19]Cut his hand off!
[387:56.91]Cut his fucking hand off!
[387:58.29]What the heck, Jeremy?
[388:02.32]Alright, this time... Not gonna fucking leave with this stat.
[388:18.51]I wasn't ready for it last time.
[388:19.57]Now I'm ready for this shit.
[388:23.85]I said I was ready for it.
[388:24.81]I lied!
[388:33.47]Ah, it just gets me every time.
[388:35.05]It's the worst thing ever.
[388:36.09]Alright, here we go.
[388:47.28]I got stealth.
[388:47.78]I have full heal.
[388:54.47]I'm ready.
[389:01.21]Aight.
[389:31.42]Oof.
[389:31.90]Oof.
[389:37.06]Watch it.
[389:39.48]Which way am I going?
[389:40.14]What if they throw rocks at me?
[390:07.29]Come here!
[390:18.90]Bastard, stop doing that!
[390:28.46]Do it!
[390:29.92]Oh, I did it!
[390:40.87]Oh.
[390:42.91]Jerma has five Red Bulls in my bloodstream.
[390:48.04]What?
[390:48.50]I don't drink Red Bull.
[390:57.56]That was a fun fight.
[390:59.09]Hmm.
[391:10.29]That was really loud.
[391:11.83]Wow.
[391:12.73]Okay.
[391:22.32]The only streamer to defeat Sam.
[391:26.04]I highly doubt that.
[391:26.64]He barely had any cyborg enhancements.
[391:30.30]Was this outcome necessary?
[391:36.00]Inconclusive.
[391:38.02]I guess even AIs don't know everything.
[391:40.94]It is likely no single correct answer exists.
[391:45.77]Additionally, human conflict stems from opposing ideals and societal norms.
[391:52.73]I was not programmed with these guidelines.
[391:56.65]You're better off figuring those out for yourself.
[392:02.67]New weapon?
[392:04.79]ID locked.
[392:06.31]A VT-7 high-frequency blade.
[392:08.93]Oh, this thing is soulbound?
[392:10.07]Great.
[392:10.39]The accuracy of the enhancement directly correlates to the quality of the original weapon.
[392:15.51]My vial indicates Sam inherited the sword from his father.
[392:20.41]Going to bury it?
[392:21.99]I will retain it in memory of Sam.
[392:34.92]One WoW reference per stream completed.
[392:50.96]I thought I couldn't use it.
[392:57.84]Rogers, we have less than one hour.
[392:59.50]Hurry!
[393:00.49]Roger that.
[393:13.65]Combat results.
[393:16.73]B. Chapter results.
[393:25.62]B. How much do I have?
[393:27.34]15,000.
[393:33.88]Where are all my big VPs?
[393:42.83]You know what I mean?
[393:43.39]I never even got this either.
[393:52.61]Well, might as well just get the final upgrade for this.
[393:57.43]Fine.
[393:57.79]You know what?
[393:58.29]You know what the final upgrade I'll get is?
[394:00.47]Sure.
[394:05.64]Everybody's just... Do it, do it, do it.
[394:07.90]I want you to do it.
[394:08.80]And we're gonna get Gray.
[394:24.99]Alright, how about, let's go back and forth here.
[394:27.17]We'll do original body, so I'm gonna go... Rock, paper, scissors, okay?
[394:32.85]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
[394:35.13]I had scissors.
[394:36.95]Beats hand.
[394:38.63]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
[394:41.02]Fuck, I had rock, you did paper again.
[394:45.74]Rock, paper-paper, scissors, shoot!
[394:47.56]Okay.
[394:49.06]You had rock and I had...
[394:59.33]I'm not going to do a pull for this.
[395:03.29]Turn on... Don't make me do it.
[395:06.80]Don't make me do it.
[395:09.42]Fine, I'll do it.
[395:14.44]Alright, guys.
[395:15.00]Go ahead.
[395:18.38]You know what to do.
[395:39.84]Well... 24 per-per-per-percent of people, uh... No, it's- it's- it's no- this is all over the place.
[395:53.75]What are you guys doing?
[395:56.53]This changes ev- what is happening right now?
[396:03.78]How is this even possible?
[396:06.79]36, 39, 32, 36, 31, 36, 34.
[396:08.27]What?
[396:09.35]This doesn't make any sense.
[396:16.51]Oh, I know what's happening.
[396:17.39]Never mind.
[396:18.25]People are clicking on both because 15,000 people have clicked the screen.
[396:24.03]Okay, well, I need to change that.
[396:32.86]One click per user.
[396:34.28]Okay, do it again.
[396:36.44]Now, we'll get to see for real.
[396:47.43]I was mashing click.
[396:48.70]Yeah, see?
[396:49.88]I know.
[396:50.20]15,000 viewers?
[396:53.76]No, 15,000 clicks.
[396:59.43]It's still too close to call.
[397:00.53]I'm going to give it 10 seconds and then whatever it is is what I'm purchasing.
[397:03.13]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[397:27.00]Oh, looks like Mariachi wins.
[397:40.46]Maybe if 22% of people weren't clicking on the robot penis, this would be a little... Now it's the other way.
[397:54.49]Zoom in.
[397:55.27]Why do I need to zoom in?
[398:04.20]Just stay as normal riding.
[398:09.07]Yeah, no, I closed it.
[398:10.23]I closed it when I said I closed it.
[398:11.85]It's mariachi.
[398:19.61]I'm gonna beat the game as the meme streamer YouTuber character.
[398:28.88]You still never apologize.
[398:29.82]Yes, I did.
[398:30.16]I said, I'm sorry that you didn't understand that what I said was not what you thought I said.
[398:34.86]I'm sorry about that.
[398:42.28]Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.
[398:44.54]You can boo all you want.
[398:45.76]I closed it and I got shit before for doing a poll and saying 10 seconds left.
[398:51.20]And then it got to zero.
[398:52.64]And then I waited and people got upset.
[398:54.47]So I can't do that.
[398:55.45]I have to buy the mariachi uniform.
[398:56.95]It's done.
[399:12.65]What a waste of fucking money.
[399:33.23]I want that right now so bad.
[399:39.35]Can we do like an award for best pizza on video game?
[399:46.00]What the fuck is this?
[399:56.80]Are you, uh, Mr. Raiden, sir?
[400:07.10]No, I am.
[400:11.98]Where is she?
[400:12.99]I'll tell her you've arrived.
[400:24.58]Hi there, stranger.
[400:25.56]Hey, you're looking good.
[400:30.68]Aw, who's your little friend?
[400:33.42]Do it.
[400:34.02]It's a long story.
[400:36.86]Jake?
[400:38.78]Do it.
[400:39.12]He's going to do it.
[400:42.12]Good boy.
[400:43.40]It was the same audio clip back to back.
[400:46.30]I guess we don't really have time to catch up.
[400:52.39]Sorry, not really.
[400:55.02]It's OK.
[400:56.08]Follow me.
[401:06.15]So exactly what kind of?
[401:07.43]You'll see.
[401:15.17]You built that?
[401:16.69]What's my costume?
[401:18.27]Yeah.
[401:35.67]Who is this?
[401:36.29]Am I supposed to know who that is?
[402:03.32]Metal Gear Solid 4, I didn't play that one.
[402:05.64]Oh, she must be part of the Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali-Lali.
[402:11.13]Oh my god.
[402:44.79]That hurt.
[402:45.59]Give me some of that pizza, man.
[402:52.56]I need some brain power.
[403:14.21]Well shit from fucking ten years ago doesn't matter Nothing you sure we got the right
[403:43.36]It's the only base big enough with security contracted out to World Marshal.
[403:47.34]Alright, I'm headed in.
[403:50.95]Oh, my goodness gracious.
[403:56.45]Put the Mariachi.
[403:57.27]Ah, it's too late for that.
[403:59.07]It's too late to put that on.
[404:11.32]Fine.
[404:34.08]God damn it.
[404:37.28]What a great end of the video game level and cutscene.
[404:45.71]Can't wait to see what the thumbnail for this video is going to be.
[405:00.38]Eliminate all enemies.
[405:03.14]Eliminate all enemies.
[405:05.94]I can't get it.
[405:26.31]Whatever.
[405:31.65]You got bounced off too much.
[405:45.62]Holy shit, I just destroyed... That guy cut into a million pieces.
[405:53.46]He just gave up after buying the Mariachi.
[405:55.60]That's not true.
[405:56.64]It is.
[406:06.35]That's actually really useful.
[406:07.78]That kills people in one hit.
[406:29.05]you see that yeah their exit codes show up as unaffiliated wait marshall has the security contract for the space why would they have their cyborg set to the same illegal exit code as desperado it's evidence against them no it's their alibi they're making it look like desperado hacked their soldiers on site because everyone knows desperado has a contract with the pakistani rebels but if we go
[406:55.52]I'm too tired to mute the game audio and voice that got this nice big foreign threat all cooked up and ready to serve The media and the public won't be able to resist Remember WMDs in Iraq.
[407:07.38]We're at the end of the game.
[407:08.40]No, I'm not gonna do that What about any humans on the base Marshall only handled security dead most likely or brainjacked if they needed them to keep up appearances I
[407:20.71]They've never publicized what airport the president was flying into, not in this region.
[407:25.17]And almost no one would have access to an outside line for security reasons.
[407:29.12]It wouldn't be difficult to keep things hush-hush, at least until Air Force One arrives.
[407:33.96]I'm heading for the control tower.
[407:35.24]All it would take is a sniper.
[407:35.96]If I can destroy the antenna array, the U.S.
[407:38.38]military will know something's wrong.
[407:40.58]Good idea.
[407:41.56]Be careful.
[407:42.18]Just... I blew the winds of destruction away.
[407:46.85]Fly backwards.
[407:57.04]Didn't break it?
[408:02.22]There's full of noises today.
[408:04.34]But I'm Jerma.
[408:05.63]I do noises.
[408:06.17]Isn't that funny?
[408:08.41]Oh, there's a machine gun in the camera.
[408:17.73]Nice.
[408:18.69]Again.
[408:20.75]These idiots.
[408:22.19]With the rocket launchers.
[408:23.51]Where are you even aiming that?
[408:24.65]He predicted where I was going to go.
[408:28.25]Nice.
[408:29.03]Really.
[408:29.83]Okay.
[408:31.74]I'm just... I can't believe it.
[408:35.28]I'm shocked to a point where it's... I'm just... Could you stop doing this?
[408:42.94]Maybe?
[408:55.64]Yeah, predict that.
[409:01.26]I can't wake it up.
[409:08.14]What?
[409:08.40]He?
[409:08.50]OK.
[409:08.70]I have no healing.
[409:12.10]I might just restart this.
[409:17.06]Instead of shooting a rocket launcher in the open crowd.
[409:26.99]Nah, I gotta restart the run, yeah?
[409:28.43]Just turn the whole game on.
[409:29.19]I gotta restart the whole game.
[409:32.01]That run's over here, guys.
[409:32.95]I'm sorry.
[409:35.27]Too much unnecessary damage here.
[409:46.74]Alright, I'm just... I gotta stop fucking around.
[409:49.59]I'm, like, making shitty noises.
[409:57.95]Okay, he's just like a floating piece of hamburger meat.
[410:00.38]It's hard to hit.
[410:06.38]I need health.
[410:11.69]Seriously, I have no healing.
[410:19.53]Seriously.
[410:30.47]What am I supposed to do?
[410:31.61]What am I supposed to do?
[410:32.48]I don't know, man.
[410:35.40]It seems like it's not even possible.
[410:37.38]I don't know what to do.
[410:38.48]Is the game actually like this?
[410:45.51]I don't understand.
[411:16.69]How did I miss that many times?
[411:18.03]Because when I would go down and swing, it would correct up a little and then correct down.
[411:21.44]You saw what was happening.
[411:22.40]Clip it and watch it.
[411:53.71]Another guy with a rocket launcher points like that.
[411:58.19]You are making me angry.
[412:08.20]Did I not block a bolt?
[412:22.50]Perfect!
[412:23.10]Alright, this is fine now.
[412:27.64]Heal.
[412:33.53]I gotta get out of it.
[412:34.49]I'm, like, underneath a submarine.
[412:35.95]Like, get away from the submarine.
[412:42.07]I didn't walk that one?
[412:43.25]Saaah!
[413:11.75]Get it?
[413:12.03]I need this.
[413:12.61]Yeah, I just need some water.
[413:18.17]That's all I need.
[413:20.99]Once I get some water in me, I'll be back to it.
[413:24.15]But I gotta... Hold on.
[413:26.85]There's gotta be a health potion in here somewhere.
[413:30.36]And I know I called it a health potion, but it doesn't matter.
[413:33.44]It's just the thing that refills your health.
[413:35.85]Got one.
[413:41.27]Get up there somehow.
[413:48.52]Can I not get up that?
[413:56.95]Okay.
[413:57.97]Where's this thing?
[413:59.09]There.
[413:59.89]Ooh, okay.
[414:00.49]I gotta get that.
[414:12.02]Endurance.
[414:14.80]My mouth is just wide open right there.
[414:16.49]Good.
[414:19.37]Do a Fortnite dance after I win the game?
[414:21.09]Absolutely.
[414:21.57]Sure.
[414:22.55]Which one do you want?
[414:23.09]I mean, there's like 200 of them, so...
[414:27.57]You got to make up your mind, though.
[414:33.99]I just want to break it.
[414:34.87]I have to.
[414:35.27]I'm sorry, guys.
[414:35.91]I got it.
[414:42.37]Nothing else.
[414:42.99]I have one healing... Whatever it's called.
[414:47.21]Let's go this way.
[414:49.58]Can I stealth kill?
[414:50.62]Not close enough right now.
[415:11.66]What?
[415:13.55]Alright, alright, hold on a minute here.
[415:16.17]I need someone- I want you to see that, because do you see it went right through the middle?
[415:21.31]The f- do it!
[415:23.37]That actually went right through the middle.
[415:29.33]It did.
[415:36.93]these backstab ones.
[415:38.39]OK.
[415:44.11]Well, we're just going to pretend like that's not happening.
[415:50.15]Enemy sighted.
[416:11.08]Jerma's upsetty spaghetti.
[416:12.52]I'm not upset, I'm fine.
[416:15.32]I'm fine.
[416:15.56]I'm not, like, mad or anything.
[416:16.88]I'm just, it's a game that requires a lot of brain power.
[416:23.40]And sometimes it's hard, and that's okay, because it's a fun game and I'm really enjoying it.
[416:27.38]I think this is a swell video game.
[416:29.22]How much is this game?
[416:32.51]Oh, no, for real, actually, no joking around, this actually is like four dollars or something, isn't it?
[416:37.05]Right now?
[416:38.25]It's not even like five bucks, I think, right now.
[416:40.27]Yeah, sorry, seven dollars and fifty cents.
[416:43.05]It's currently part of the sale, so.
[416:44.37]If you like what you see, by all means, download it, you know?
[416:57.05]The game's almost five years old.
[417:06.99]The sale for the game ends in three minutes.
[417:10.91]Really?
[417:12.89]Are you serious?
[417:37.41]It ends tomorrow.
[417:38.57]We've got about 12 hours.
[417:40.67]He wants to spend $7.50.
[417:47.47]Stop talking.
[417:48.96]Come on.
[417:50.42]There's nobody even talking on the screen.
[417:52.78]It's just rocks and explosions.
[417:54.80]I can talk during this.
[418:27.79]A tiny guy is gonna get out.
[418:31.63]Yeah.
[418:34.29]Well, if it isn't Saucy Jack.
[418:39.28]Check the internet.
[419:09.76]How'd they know?
[419:10.82]Someone posted photos of what's happening on the base.
[419:13.52]The whole world is up in arms.
[419:15.80]Show me.
[419:18.70]What?
[419:19.68]How did they... Look at all those tabs.
[419:29.44]The story leaked early.
[419:31.24]Then Marshall's plan is ruined.
[419:33.20]The hell it is.
[419:35.02]Look what they're saying.
[419:36.80]The story just went live, and already they're calling for blood.
[419:48.43]But the president was saved.
[419:50.89]And yet American blood was spilled.
[419:53.87]By Americans.
[419:55.61]Besides, a few dozen soldiers is tragic, but nothing to start a major war over.
[420:00.59]That's just a spark, son.
[420:03.83]The excuse we've been waiting for.
[420:06.56]America's wanted this war for years.
[420:09.74]The Patriots, they knew war was good for the economy.
[420:12.86]Four years later, their legacy lingers on.
[420:15.28]The Memes, they left us their great isms.
[420:20.22]Nationalism, unilateralism, materialism.
[420:24.65]Welcome maxims for those with no faith, without guiding principles of their own.
[420:30.78]Give yourself up to the whole.
[420:32.43]No need to better yourself.
[420:33.99]You're American.
[420:35.39]You're number one.
[420:37.29]Then the only value left is dollar value.
[420:40.07]The economy.
[420:41.25]So we'll do whatever it takes to keep it humming along.
[420:44.93]Even war.
[420:46.33]Especially war.
[420:48.35]Bullshit!
[420:49.29]The Patriots planted the seed.
[420:51.21]We don't need them around to filter and foster their memes any longer.
[420:55.29]We're spreading them just fine ourselves.
[420:58.94]Every American man, woman and child.
[421:02.46]We're all sons of the Patriots now!
[421:08.14]I'm surprised with this.
[421:08.83]We just need something to jumpstart the economy out of this funk.
[421:12.83]This recession has been stuck in since the fall of SOP.
[421:17.87]Ha!
[421:18.61]And the military costs?
[421:20.37]Wasting billions is going to help the economy?
[421:23.87]BMCs, arms manufacturers, job creators, Jack.
[421:29.86]I just imagine Kojima sitting there, you know, at his computer.
[421:33.06]Wait, Kojima didn't make this.
[421:34.00]Kojima had to watch this.
[422:02.64]Is he surrounding himself with memes?
[422:04.34]I don't understand.
[422:16.65]What's he doing to me?
[422:32.55]Metal Gear Ant.
[422:49.66]Let's go!
[422:51.14]Stop Metal Gear Ant.
[422:52.28]There's got to be some super secret leg way to kill him in one hit, right?
[423:05.64]I've locked it.
[423:10.24]Climb up, maybe?
[423:11.28]Turn on your facecam.
[423:14.07]Nah, I can't.
[423:14.53]I can't, I can't, I can't.
[423:17.59]Dodge it?
[423:18.05]Oooh, there's me getting hit.
[423:21.43]I feel like I need to climb on top of this.
[423:25.29]Look at that.
[423:27.41]I guess I'm doing damage to him.
[423:30.17]Let's pay attention.
[423:40.52]That does a lot of damage.
[423:42.66]Okay, I'm just gonna use that.
[423:57.41]Here he comes.
[423:59.86]Ow!
[424:00.97]Why am I doing that voice?
[424:01.89]Like, seriously, what are you doing?
[424:04.57]I'm just, like, tired, and I'm going, like... Ah!
[424:08.93]Like, that's not... Like, I'm too nervous.
[424:17.22]I wonder what does more of that, or... I'm not sure.
[424:22.70]Maybe I don't have to restart.
[424:26.92]Alright, I got it.
[424:27.46]I got it.
[424:29.83]Follow him this way?
[424:30.43]No, he's putting his lead over here.
[424:40.24]Are you gonna do it again?
[424:41.24]Okay, fine.
[424:42.06]What if I just block it?
[424:45.38]Yeah, I can just grab it.
[425:03.90]This is very... Again?
[425:09.42]Aww... What are we doing now?
[425:14.29]What's that?
[425:14.57]Is it electrocution?
[425:15.53]Okay.
[425:18.67]Do it again?
[425:20.35]Uhhh... I guess we're going up here.
[425:31.56]One leg down?
[425:37.15]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[425:41.43]What did I do?
[425:55.31]Back down on the ground.
[425:56.21]Checkpoint!
[426:00.97]Error, right in the face?
[426:03.61]Ooh, get him with... There we go.
[426:05.21]Two, three percent.
[426:07.31]Two percent.
[426:08.81]Charge it!
[426:09.71]What are you thinking, Jeremy?
[426:11.59]Nice, okay.
[426:12.37]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[426:14.53]This is really cool.
[426:22.16]Oh, no.
[426:23.40]That's... No, I don't want this.
[426:27.34]I don't want this.
[426:44.51]I gotta put him into that beam.
[426:51.05]How could you be far away from that?
[426:52.67]I had it.
[426:53.74]It was done.
[427:05.71]Come on, get it!
[427:11.80]Once again, this should be a dodge.
[427:24.35]Slide!
[427:36.32]You can always tell when it's gonna be... You see the lines.
[427:39.31]That's not gonna be a line.
[427:41.09]Fuck it.
[427:42.21]Oops.
[427:44.43]Just caught that at the last second.
[427:47.71]You can see that.
[427:50.69]Oh, he's got like five hands.
[427:56.48]Grand lead.
[427:57.06]Okay.
[428:13.71]I have the super move.
[428:14.31]I'm going to activate it, make sure everything's down.
[428:27.32]Activate it.
[428:29.10]Oh, that kind of didn't really do much for me there.
[428:45.25]How did I not dodge that?
[428:46.19]I'm so mad!
[428:58.20]Foot!
[428:59.20]Here comes a foot!
[429:09.12]Oh no!
[429:09.84]Is that it?
[429:19.20]Up top.
[429:19.74]How the leg goes off.
[429:20.90]Cut it!
[429:29.32]Same thing, up the leg.
[429:31.28]You can see him.
[429:45.63]Goodbye.
[429:50.25]Checkpoint again.
[429:51.25]I still have one heal.
[429:51.97]Oh, fuck.
[429:53.77]Okay.
[429:54.05]I'm not actually gonna pick him up and throw him, am I?
[430:01.86]Well, alright, that was pretty awesome.
[430:05.46]I'm suplexing him.
[430:18.71]I'm going to throw this into him.
[430:23.36]I'm sword fighting him with his own arm.
[430:25.42]This is so dumb.
[430:26.38]I love it.
[430:30.82]I got to arm wrestle him.
[430:36.94]Come on.
[430:46.57]Oh.
[430:46.65]I cut it in half.
[430:51.14]How many times do I have to cut him?
[430:53.50]I got it, okay.
[431:03.92]Use the other stick?
[431:04.62]I can't.
[431:05.52]It can only go one way.
[431:21.46]How many times can I do this?
[431:26.53]I'm turning him into water.
[431:27.95]He just looks like the ocean.
[431:36.05]Cut down.
[431:39.25]I can't cut down.
[431:42.71]Whoa, wait.
[431:43.47]What the fuck?
[431:46.37]Alright, I guess I can cut down.
[432:01.32]That's enough.
[432:05.81]These pieces are despawning.
[432:09.69]What's left?
[432:10.17]This arm?
[432:11.17]Look at the parts, I'm just getting parts.
[432:35.62]264.
[432:35.64]290.
[432:35.66]I can just farm this forever.
[432:38.26]Let the button go.
[433:14.69]Alright, there's really only one piece left.
[433:16.73]It's right here.
[433:19.19]He's dead.
[433:35.76]Farm it and buy another suit.
[433:37.00]Well, here he comes, but this one's going.
[433:49.11]What the hell?
[433:50.05]What is this?
[433:50.61]How is he gonna dock Octopus this shit?
[434:00.40]Is he really?
[434:26.28]Just made him a little bit fatter and spread his shoulders out.
[434:34.99]What happened to his face?
[434:52.00]No, don't- I don't want to say the thing I'm going to say.
[434:54.52]I don't want to say the thing because it's an anime reference and people are going to be freaking out about it.
[434:58.29]Greed for full metal alchemists.
[435:00.19]And I said it already.
[435:01.25]Try University of Texas.
[435:08.43]Could have gone pro if I hadn't joined the Navy.
[435:10.95]I'm not one of those beltway pansies.
[435:13.74]I could break the present in two.
[435:16.56]With my bare hands.
[435:23.67]Don't fuck with this senator.
[435:37.98]Why don't you stick around and find out?
[435:41.18]Am I going to get my ass kicked here?
[435:42.80]Is this the real final final final boss of the game?
[435:58.65]I went for it, but, you know, whatever.
[436:09.56]90?
[436:09.86]He's got so much health!
[436:12.96]I can't move!
[436:13.70]I'm in the corner!
[436:15.60]I can't even get out of here!
[436:17.86]There's no getting out of- Thank- Please throw me out of the corner.
[436:20.12]That'd be great.
[436:32.07]I'm in the corner again.
[436:33.53]I never left.
[436:34.29]I have to restart this and get out of the corner.
[436:44.46]Was he just going, Raiden!
[436:46.92]No he wasn't, Raiden.
[436:48.28]Kill this!
[437:12.87]Missed him, oh my god.
[437:14.31]Right in the head, come on, headshot, headshot.
[437:18.19]Put it away!
[437:21.42]I'm trying.
[437:24.28]And I'm back in the corner.
[437:30.24]That was right on his body!
[437:37.11]That was right on his body, and I know I'm having a little bit of an up...
[437:47.18]That... I tried to dodge.
[437:48.28]What hap... what?
[437:49.24]Oh.
[437:49.76]I win.
[438:18.75]Typical politician.
[438:30.03]Big promises, but all talk.
[438:35.10]What?
[438:35.34]Jumpstart the economy?
[438:53.74]So glad he's doing this for me.
[438:55.46]Alright, the truth then.
[439:23.35]You're right about one thing.
[439:28.41]I do need capital.
[439:30.55]And votes.
[439:32.10]Wanna know why?
[439:33.28]I have a dream.
[439:36.92]What?
[439:37.88]That one day, every person in this nation will control their own destiny.
[439:44.41]A land of the truly free, dammit!
[439:47.21]I lost track two hours ago.
[439:48.49]A nation of action, not words ruled by strength, not committee!
[439:53.07]Where the law changes to suit the individual... ...not the other way around!
[439:59.91]Where power and justice are back where they belong... ...in the hands of the people!
[440:17.22]Where every man is free... ...to think... ...to ask!
[440:27.98]Chicken shit bureaucrats!
[440:30.79]Fuck this 24-7 internet spew of trivia and celebrity bullshit!
[440:41.75]Fuck American pride!
[440:43.53]Fuck the media!
[440:47.75]Fuck all of it!
[440:51.81]America is diseased, rotten to the core.
[440:56.18]There's no saving it.
[440:58.80]We need to pull it out by the roots.
[441:01.94]Wipe the sleigh clean.
[441:04.28]Burn it down!
[441:09.18]And from the ashes into America... Why are we in A-mode only mode?
[441:12.62]Evolve, but unchained!
[441:16.70]The weak will be purged.
[441:19.31]And the strongest will thrive.
[441:21.79]Free to live as they see fit.
[441:24.05]They'll make America great again!
[441:25.63]Are you serious?
[441:27.15]What the hell are you talking about?
[441:31.91]When did this game come out?
[441:33.13]What?
[441:33.47]You still don't get it.
[441:34.91]Wait, hold on.
[441:35.87]I'm using war as a business to get elected.
[441:41.10]So I can end war as a business.
[441:44.36]Are you serious?
[441:48.11]In my new America, people will die and kill for what they believe.
[441:56.28]Not for money.
[441:57.36]Not for oil.
[441:59.96]Not for what they're told is right.
[442:02.14]Every man will be free to fight his own wars.
[442:10.46]They must have really liked this game.
[442:29.56]So, what do you think?
[442:37.20]How the hell did you get elected?
[442:40.06]Well, I don't write my own speeches.
[442:46.36]You should try fighting for what you believe in sometime, Jack.
[442:50.12]Not for a company or a nation or for anyone else.
[442:59.55]maybe I was wrong about you am I finally getting through I'll rid this world of heartless wars Jack dusting him off what the hell what is going on
[443:35.91]You're batshit insane!
[443:37.87]He's just baiting it out.
[443:48.12]That's the worst way you could possibly get up and look behind you.
[443:58.31]Making the mother of all omelettes here, Jack.
[444:00.73]Can't fret over every egg.
[444:02.75]Not when you're purging the weak, right?
[444:06.03]The real boss fight.
[444:06.81]No weapons.
[444:08.03]Just fist fighting, right?
[444:36.18]Uh, apparently.
[444:36.62]I guess?
[444:37.34]I don't know.
[444:41.81]That just killed the whole moment.
[444:43.77]That killed the whole entire moment.
[444:54.07]How would you- I was doing cartwheels!
[444:57.43]That cutscene was so long I forgot how to play the game!
[445:22.21]0.1, that's supposed to happen.
[445:30.31]Hear that one?
[446:03.04]I'm gonna- I'm gonna stop.
[446:16.48]Why won't you die?
[446:23.43]I don't know.
[446:25.55]Is there more of this shit?
[446:28.71]I can't handle this anymore.
[446:30.13]Nanomachines, son!
[446:34.48]If your glasses aren't made of nanomachines, how are they still fine?
[446:44.19]They should be broken, but off your head.
[446:49.99]What an oversight by the dev team.
[447:07.60]You know what I mean?
[447:17.15]Die, you piece of shit!
[447:52.98]Alright.
[447:54.40]I think we're about done here.
[447:59.55]Right.
[448:06.61]Well, begin playback.
[448:12.60]Two years I've been working towards this.
[448:15.25]And on the last day, Blondie has me doubting the whole thing.
[448:20.39]We'll leave it up to fate then, shall we, Wolfie?
[448:23.81]A duel to the death.
[448:25.71]May the best man win.
[448:29.20]Sam.
[448:31.00]I cut him down, and that's that.
[448:33.70]Back to our regularly scheduled international incident.
[448:36.54]Now I can hurt him.
[448:39.54]But if he beats me,
[448:42.23]If I die here, the lock on my blade will disable after a couple hours.
[448:49.11]What happens after that is up to you, Wolfie.
[448:53.76]Even dead, that guy's a pain in my ass.
[448:56.66]Yeah, this is stupid.
[448:57.54]I'm too cool for this.
[449:00.62]So, you think that little sword can save your master?
[449:07.41]Well, go ahead then.
[449:10.18]But make no mistake, Fido.
[449:14.04]Sometimes I look over and you guys say the funniest fucking random shit, man.
[449:17.78]You're next.
[449:20.57]I was not designed to fear termination.
[449:25.91]However, Directive 01 is to ensure all data acquired is preserved and passed along.
[449:33.65]To expire here would violate that directive.
[449:39.01]This is like a 30 minute ending sequence here.
[450:26.85]Now for the real fight, right?
[450:29.39]I said my sword was a tool of justice.
[450:34.56]Not used in anger.
[450:37.22]Not used for vengeance.
[450:42.90]And it's my favorite flavor.
[450:46.40]Strawberry!
[450:47.49]And besides, this isn't my sword.
[450:56.73]This isn't my sword.
[451:01.24]Glasses are off.
[451:14.27]It's gonna play a good song like that, right?
[451:29.58]Try not to be standing near him when he does that.
[451:31.79]Oh god, yes.
[451:36.21]Oh man, he just killed me.
[451:45.31]What happened?
[451:51.45]Tap.
[451:54.68]Nice.
[451:57.93]Get the sword back.
[451:58.61]Let's pick it up or it will just automatically be in my hands.
[452:07.66]Get the pick.
[452:14.00]Grab the sword please.
[452:29.11]Oh god, I'm gonna have to cut through this shit.
[452:37.00]Wait a minute!
[452:38.04]Oh no, not this dumb thing!
[452:39.32]Got it.
[452:47.42]What?
[452:47.80]Holy fuck, his head.
[452:48.70]Okay, got it.
[452:54.43]Wish I had health.
[453:04.19]What's on the ground?
[453:04.73]Is there a health pack on the ground?
[453:05.95]Better be.
[453:06.37]Yes, it is!
[453:06.83]Two of them!
[453:07.35]Give me the other one.
[453:08.81]Where'd the other one go?
[453:10.39]I got it.
[453:10.65]Yeah, I got it.
[453:11.15]Got it, got it, got it, got it.
[453:11.95]Where's the sword?
[453:12.41]I don't know where the sword... I'm freaking out right now.
[453:14.89]Where's... Do I have the sword?
[453:20.03]Just don't... Where am I... Don't... Oh, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[453:22.19]It's like a World of... No, you say World of Warcraft a thousand times in the stream, but that's a World of Warcraft telegraph encounter.
[453:26.54]I got it.
[453:44.88]Grab the sword, quick!
[453:47.90]Another health?
[453:58.87]Yup.
[453:59.97]Holy fuck, these are everywhere.
[454:03.43]Just stand here.
[454:09.05]Oh fuck!
[454:09.61]I didn't know he did that!
[454:12.73]Oh, man.
[454:13.81]What am I thinking here?
[454:26.61]Plenty of health.
[454:27.11]It's fine.
[454:28.55]I'm going to go again.
[454:30.27]Don't work it out.
[454:43.95]He didn't swing the first time.
[454:46.46]Alright, 75%.
[454:53.54]Almost there.
[454:57.16]More healing.
[455:04.19]It's like, it's just impossible to lose this and go.
[455:17.72]It's a green here.
[455:26.69]Oh no, he's healing.
[455:28.13]Cut the green off his head.
[455:30.10]I have no idea what that meant.
[456:01.19]He caught me!
[456:08.57]I was above him!
[456:22.79]One of these one more time and I gotta... Alright.
[456:33.92]Hey, how are ya?
[456:49.55]He's dead.
[456:50.65]Game over.
[456:52.21]0.1%.
[456:52.25]One hit and he's down.
[456:53.05]I'm gonna tap him.
[456:53.75]Uh... What?
[456:57.59]I thought I just had to hit him once.
[457:11.94]How did I not beat him?
[457:20.62]It's part of the game.
[457:21.94]It's part of the show.
[457:39.84]Through the chest.
[457:41.61]Through the stomach.
[457:51.60]Unless there's more.
[457:54.14]Unless there's more.
[458:05.93]And this is where we cut him up into a million pieces.
[458:07.77]Here we go.
[458:20.26]All of his juices have fallen out.
[458:22.16]Well done, Jack.
[458:28.89]I can't imagine if I did this shit on purpose.
[458:32.45]Your dream dies with you.
[458:41.06]Maybe not.
[458:43.02]You've guaranteed the status quo will go on.
[458:46.58]For a while longer, at least.
[458:49.86]War will continue as an institution, as an industry.
[458:55.56]Men will fight for reasons they don't understand, causes they don't believe in.
[459:12.07]But at least I'll leave a worthy successor.
[459:21.60]Jack!
[459:22.06]You carve your own path.
[459:26.86]Use whatever methods you see fit.
[459:34.27]You don't let legal bullshit get in the way.
[459:37.70]And if it costs a few lives, so be it.
[460:00.57]Shall I be awake for this?
[460:04.24]Deep inside, we're kindred spirits.
[460:35.63]What a game.
[460:36.05]B, B, B.
[460:55.24]The Murasama Blade is unlocked.
[460:58.26]Infinity War has been watched.
[461:04.36]What?
[461:05.54]I'm tired.
[461:10.49]President Hamilton returns from Pakistan today, completing his first visit to the country since the failed assassination attempt in Shahbazabad last May.
[461:19.80]In meetings with Pakistani President Farooq Salam, the two leaders agreed to a new joint initiative in the War on Terror, whereby U.S.
[461:27.40]Marines will be stationed in Pakistan and given wider authority to conduct operations within the country.
[461:34.03]This is amidst growing tensions within Pakistan between the country's civil and military leadership, with many in the government calling on the ISI military intelligence.
[461:43.27]I'm wearing a sleep mask.
[461:45.01]Pizza!
[461:46.01]After all that.
[461:47.09]Oh, I can't wait to eat.
[461:48.93]I can't wait to have food.
[461:49.55]For the last time, let it go, Courtney.
[461:52.67]At least Armstrong will never be president.
[461:57.41]But, I mean, Raiden.
[462:07.69]I guess the world's first cyborg staffing firm is officially open for business.
[462:11.57]Are they going to make another one of these?
[462:34.71]No.
[462:34.83]And we're sure this isn't child labor?
[462:37.29]The older children can work now, the rest when they come of age.
[462:42.05]And it's strictly voluntary, you know.
[462:45.10]We're not running a charity here, huh?
[462:46.36]Oh, there's the spill?
[462:50.28]Okay, I get it.
[462:50.58]The solutions alone will not even cover their maintenance.
[462:54.62]Besides, this way they'll learn a trade.
[462:56.93]Perhaps some discipline, huh?
[462:59.23]It's not a perfect solution.
[463:02.07]What the f-?
[463:03.13]Jeez.
[463:18.60]How much weight were you putting on his shoulder for that to happen?
[463:21.98]Well, another benefit.
[463:24.84]A peaceful application for all my research.
[463:29.91]Since when do you care?
[463:31.39]Well, recent events have been food for thought, shall we say?
[463:35.85]Yeah.
[463:37.95]No kidding.
[463:39.74]Speaking of recent events, how's our new recruit working out?
[463:45.12]Ah, yes, quite well.
[463:48.75]all leaning in at the same time.
[463:50.03]That's kind of weird.
[463:52.27]Oi, Sunny!
[463:52.91]Where you have to stand?
[463:55.27]Hang on.
[463:56.17]Just give me one second.
[463:58.70]Yeah, okay.
[464:00.38]You make me head spin, you know?
[464:01.88]You're same age as me, but all these spaceships?
[464:08.44]You're a genius, girl.
[464:10.55]Mm-hmm.
[464:11.65]And you're hot for days.
[464:13.41]Huh?
[464:22.09]Somebody could have just died right there.
[464:23.85]Really.
[464:26.15]Slow down.
[464:30.66]He's dead.
[464:31.18]He just killed him.
[464:31.76]Huh?
[464:51.38]He rescued me too, you know.
[464:54.00]Saved my life.
[464:56.09]I owe him everything.
[464:59.71]To some people, he'll always be Jack the Ripper.
[465:03.35]Those papers are huge.
[465:05.85]Yeah, they are.
[465:09.29]They are gigantic.
[465:10.19]I know all about his past.
[465:11.85]And the font is too.
[465:15.23]He had it rough.
[465:17.59]And he hurt a lot of people.
[465:20.46]Hmm.
[465:21.56]But that's not the Raiden I know.
[465:26.93]The Raiden I know... is a hero.
[465:51.86]Oh, right.
[465:53.02]That was the game.
[465:53.80]That's it.
[465:58.40]Metal Gear Rising Revenge, and so they're not making another one.
[466:01.94]Well, that's $100 from Ace McClase.
[466:18.94]Ace Mclace, thanks for the 100 bucks.
[466:22.10]Good job, chumbo.
[466:23.86]Chumbo.
[466:24.46]Merc.
[466:28.40]Incredibly generous of you.
[466:29.27]Thank you so much for 100 fucking dollars.
[466:32.39]Somebody, uh, PunchGob gave five community subs earlier.
[466:36.25]I missed it because I was in the middle of, like, a meltdown or something.
[466:42.87]Uh, that was, that was good.
[466:45.17]That was good.
[466:45.67]I need you to take like, I just, see what happened, you know, I started to get a little flustered, a little frustrated about four and a half hours in.
[466:53.00]Go grab water, just like, just hang out for a second.
[466:56.68]Take a sec, come back, and then we're good to go, you know?
[467:00.12]Uh, no, that was fun.
[467:07.51]For $7.50.
[467:12.83]You want to know something really funny?
[467:14.79]This stream is 7 hours and 48 minutes long.
[467:21.07]The game was $7.50.
[467:21.65]We did the math.
[467:34.02]A dollar a minute?
[467:35.14]No, that's... That's a cent... That's a... Wait, is that a cent every... That's a cent per minute.
[467:49.93]A dollar a minute would... No, that's not... That would be 700... That'd be like seven... It's too late.
[467:57.27]It's too... I'm too... Flustrated.
[467:59.53]It's a dollar every one point... You know what I'm saying?
[468:04.80]It's a $7.50 game with seven hours and 50 cents.
[468:07.32]One cent per hour.
[468:08.58]Whatever the fuck it is.
[468:09.54]I don't even know.
[468:10.86]Thanks for watching.
[468:17.08]Seven... Seven hours and 50 cents.
[468:22.77]A dollar an hour.
[468:23.57].8, whatever it is.
[468:25.61]There's a post-credit scene, apparently.
[468:30.61]We're gonna stay.
[468:35.51]But also, I wanna... The reason why we're going... I had an opportunity to... To... Oh, leave and do it again tomorrow or something.
[468:43.71]But I wanted to get the whole thing done tonight.
[468:44.99]Because I want to do a longer stream tonight.
[468:47.64]Because I have some plans over the next couple days.
[468:52.76]And I'm not going to be around for the next two days to stream.
[468:57.01]So... You will see me again.
[469:01.35]I know I've been going... It's really erratic the last week with the whole New Year's Eve thing.
[469:05.59]And then pushing back streams and the Christmas Eve thing.
[469:09.57]But... Really wanted to do at least like an 8 to 9 plus hour stream tonight.
[469:15.55]So what's going to happen is...
[469:18.37]Today, no, well, technically today for a lot of you guys.
[469:22.09]What's today, Thursday?
[469:23.13]What is today?
[469:23.69]Today's technically Wednesday.
[469:27.61]Yeah, so Thursday, Friday, I'm not gonna be live.
[469:30.43]And then we're gonna go Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[469:35.08]We'll go three days in a row after I come back from doing things that I was planning on doing.
[469:43.07]So we'll do the whole weekend, Saturday, Sunday, and then Monday.
[469:45.49]There's a lot of shit to do.
[469:46.61]I was thinking about booting up the PlayStation 2 and doing Simpsons Hit and Run for the weekend, maybe.
[469:54.26]And if not that, then there's also Best for Cleanup Detail.
[469:56.50]There's also a more Kenshi.
[469:58.90]I plan on going three or four straight days in a row.
[470:07.81]Final thoughts?
[470:09.47]If you don't own this game, it sure is a lot of fun for $7.
[470:17.51]Great Canadian Fuck Club just gave out 10 community subs.
[470:20.53]10 more to add to the list of the hundreds.
[470:22.85]The actual hundreds of community subs that you have given.
[470:33.93]Do a Fortnite dance.
[470:34.89]What are you talking about?
[470:39.71]I've ever played Monster Hunter?
[470:41.49]Yeah, actually, I played a lot of Monster Hunter: World.
[470:44.05]Streamed it a few times.
[470:46.75]Played pretty much to the end of the game.
[470:48.69]Not on stream, but... Darth Vader?
[470:51.61]What?
[470:52.55]Oh, no.
[470:57.88]I played one of the old ones on stream, too.
[471:05.76]You said you would do dance.
[471:09.61]I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[471:11.89]Do the Fortnite dance.
[471:23.50]Double D, thanks for the five community subs right at the end here.
[471:27.20]We'll do the bits too.
[471:27.84]We'll hang out for a little while.
[471:29.32]I just want to see if there's something at the end.
[471:33.67]But thank you so much, Double D. Five community subs.
[471:37.30]Don't run away from this.
[471:38.22]Alright, fucking fine.
[471:41.55]Really?
[471:42.59]I don't even know which one is which.
[471:44.89]I'm going to crash the game.
[471:49.95]Okay, so... I'm just going to say this is one.
[472:13.42]He was at hairline.
[472:14.54]Turn off the hairline.
[472:19.22]Worst hair?
[472:21.06]This is... This looks good.
[472:22.12]I just did a baby little kid dance.
[472:46.62]Alright, here we go.
[472:47.95]Here is the end of the stream voice cutscene.
[472:57.11]Acknowledge the DLC.
[473:00.08]Okay.
[473:07.64]How much does the DLC add?
[473:16.61]Thank you.
[473:20.46]That's a couple hours.
[473:23.66]Two stories and about Sam.
[473:25.40]Oh, that's cool.
[473:29.78]It's great.
[473:32.20]Three hours, super fun, all story related.
[473:34.28]Alright.
[473:37.56]Yeah.
[473:41.32]That's kind of a weird, that's going to have to be a scenario where
[473:45.88]Because if it's like a three-hour experience, that's not enough to do for a whole stream.
[473:50.46]So that'd have to be a day where there's something to do for two or three hours and then that.
[473:55.84]We kind of need two, three to four-hour experiences back-to-back.
[473:58.89]You know what I mean?
[474:00.83]I keep saying it.
[474:02.37]You know what I mean?
[474:05.05]New Year's resolution, okay?
[474:06.05]2020.
[474:06.29]I'm going to stop saying it.
[474:07.11]Here we go.
[474:10.32]Oh, good, good.
[474:12.44]Their doctor's research and staffing service certainly help.
[474:15.66]I hear World Marshal is looking for a buyer.
[474:20.77]Well, you cost them a lot of money, no?
[474:23.85]Not to mention killing their funding.
[474:25.93]Literally.
[474:28.25]The bread-taking program is finished, but the larger company is not, I'm afraid.
[474:34.43]Someone will buy them.
[474:36.11]PMCs are in demand once again.
[474:40.24]fighting for reasons they don't understand.
[474:42.78]Personal micro-computers.
[474:44.80]Big pardon?
[474:46.06]No.
[474:47.14]Nothing.
[474:50.37]So, your mind is made?
[474:53.55]You will not come back.
[474:55.67]Sorry, Boris.
[474:57.31]I understand.
[474:58.83]But then, what will you do?
[475:08.48]I'm so glad they ended this game on, uh, heh.
[475:15.39]Oh my god.
[475:23.63]Uh... Gnrl Apocalyptic Cheeseburger.
[475:27.62]$100.
[475:29.54]I feel like I've seen $100 pop up here like three or four times tonight.
[475:37.51]Thank you, guys.
[475:40.76]Thank you so much.
[475:43.47]And Apocalyptic Cheeseburger says,
[475:46.64]Jerma, thanks.
[475:47.18]While I know you do streaming for everyone, I found that your streams helped me through the hardest parts of my life.
[475:52.10]Now that the new year has arrived and my first semester for college went splendidly well, I felt it was necessary to thank you.
[475:58.16]I'm glad I saw you play one of my favorite games and hear one of my favorite OSTs as I start to the new year.
[476:03.29]I know it's a frustrating game sometimes.
[476:05.03]Keep being you.
[476:05.67]Best wishes, General.
[476:07.09]What's General?
[476:07.79]Okay, General Apocalyptic Cheeseburger.
[476:10.51]Thank you for the hundred dollars.
[476:23.49]Thank you so much.
[476:25.53]Happy to play.
[476:26.15]I mean, this was very heavily... Eh, whatever.
[476:29.10]It's a C. This was a highly requested game.
[476:32.52]People said, play it.
[476:33.46]You'll like it.
[476:33.86]You'll like it.
[476:35.12]It's frustrating, but you'll like it.
[476:36.26]And, I mean, it was, but it wasn't, though.
[476:38.90]It was just a few parts of the game that I was just having trouble with.
[476:42.08]But that was also... You know, gamer fatigue sets in a little bit.
[476:45.68]And you gotta go get a drink of water, and you come back, and you're fine.
[476:54.75]Hold on, I... I didn't... Look at these.
[476:59.71]Look at these stats.
[477:01.83]Uh... Legs severed, two.
[477:06.70]Right... I only severed a right leg one time.
[477:09.80]43 right arms severed.
[477:19.32]What is title?
[477:20.29]Zero.
[477:24.35]Oh my god!
[477:25.67]Gornhole gave $100.
[477:26.53]Thank you.
[477:26.79]100, 100, 100, 100.
[477:26.89]Thank you so much, guys.
[477:31.58]Played it continuously without quitting to the main menu.
[477:55.51]Is that really what that means?
[478:06.64]So what is title 0?
[478:12.86]That was a speedrun.
[478:13.68]Hey, that was a speedrun.
[478:15.50]It was a slow one.
[478:18.58]Complete normal or higher difficulty in less than 8 hours.
[478:23.70]Alright, I did it.
[478:24.45]I did that.
[478:26.92]Mr. 1%, complete normal or higher difficulty while earning 300,000 BP or more.
[478:31.67]1%.
[478:34.51]Complete normal or higher difficulty while only using the high frequency blade as a weapon.
[478:38.89]Thank you.
[478:42.79]Battle test to complete normal or higher difficulties by being discovered by enemies 50 or more times.
[478:49.12]That seems like a lot.
[478:51.74]Jack the Ripper, cut your enemies at least 1,000 times using blade mode.
[478:57.75]Oh, so that's what title is.
[478:59.22]Get it.
[478:59.80]Got it.
[479:00.06]Needs achievements.
[479:05.34]But thank you so much, Goin' Hole.
[479:06.52]Thank you so much, General Apocalyptic Cheeseburger.
[479:13.55]I don't even know what to say.
[479:15.75]Thank you.
[479:18.63]Fuck, it's a C total.
[479:21.21]No, it can't be a C total.
[479:23.11]It has to be B. Whatever.
[479:38.72]I'm just curious.
[479:40.54]Playtime, four hours and 35 minutes.
[479:42.64]What?
[479:46.58]That doesn't make any sense.
[479:49.76]The stream's been going for eight hours.
[479:55.42]Was that all the cutscenes?
[480:01.02]Oh, man.
[480:01.88]Pauses and cutscenes.
[480:03.20]Well, alright.
[480:04.06]4 hours and 35 minutes.
[480:08.60]Alright.
[480:09.17]That's gonna be my time.
[480:13.27]We'll go to the back of the bits.
[480:16.07]Back earlier.
[480:17.39]Back of the bit readings here.
[480:19.43]Here we are.
[480:24.45]Down here.
[480:26.91]Yeah.
[480:27.75]And then you guys will see me again on Saturday.
[480:32.59]So, take care, everybody.
[480:33.87]If you're gonna take off, it's pretty late for a lot of you guys now, so... Do the code.
[480:38.45]Do the code.
[480:39.03]What do you mean the... Okay, hold on.
[480:40.09]Do the code.
[480:45.09]Do the Konami code.
[480:47.65]I know it by heart, don't worry.
[480:50.81]At where?
[480:51.29]Here?
[480:51.51]At the title?
[480:55.89]What should I do?
[480:57.15]Okay.
[481:05.48]Metal Gear Rising.
[481:07.48]Revengeance.
[481:08.84]I did it.
[481:13.62]Up, up.
[481:14.04]It's up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
[481:20.53]Metal Gear Rising.
[481:22.55]Revengeance.
[481:23.47]It adds a difficulty?
[481:25.19]Are you kidding me?
[481:49.25]I imagine the game on hard is incredibly frustrating.
[481:52.73]This is very hard and is a revenge.
[482:04.26]I just need to know.
[482:05.56]We'll go through the bits while I do this.
[482:06.76]I was just curious as to how horrible this is.
[482:14.85]Thank you, Binary Man, for the $1.
[482:17.49]Chat, chat, we're the chat.
[482:20.35]We... What do we do?
[482:24.41]We pray on Twitch.
[482:25.29]We stalk the VODs.
[482:26.29]We're the chat.
[482:28.53]Thank you, Binary Man.
[482:33.72]Mouse on screen.
[482:34.86]Binary Man gave $4.
[482:36.42]Why is this three times louder?
[482:38.62]Is that what it does?
[482:39.42]Revenge makes the game louder?
[482:40.60]Okay.
[482:47.81]Some of you guys are made for that.
[482:49.35]Not me.
[483:13.34]What a bad gamer.
[483:14.38]I guess he's dead forever, yeah.
[483:16.94]But thank you, BinaryMan, for the one, two, three, four, five dollars here.
[483:23.10]Hey, Jerma.
[483:24.21]I know I'm a little bit late, but here's a video I made for the green screen movie night and didn't finish in time.
[483:28.19]Hope you like it.
[483:29.59]Hold on to it.
[483:30.13]We're gonna do another green screen movie night, so... We will compile it again.
[483:35.71]We're gonna do an encore night, so... Hold on to that video.
[483:42.75]But thank you, Binary Man, for your $5 here.
[483:48.15]Does chat counting count as counting as we counters count because we like counting?
[483:55.23]You lost me at does.
[483:59.41]But thank you so much for the $5.
[484:00.49]Thank you, SuperSale, for the $1.
[484:01.69]Congrats on becoming a top 900 streamer.
[484:04.85]I did actually hear about this.
[484:07.06]No longer top 1,000.
[484:07.66]Top 900 streamers.
[484:15.24]It did happen.
[484:17.66]I'm number 899 on Twitch.
[484:25.18]See you at the top 800.
[484:29.08]Let's go.
[484:35.28]Thank you, FlankTank, for the $1 New Year's night.
[484:37.16]I had a dream similar to this.
[484:40.54]A dream similar to this.
[484:47.82]I have no idea what the hell you just linked me, but... Let's see.
[484:58.49]I knew it was... I got it.
[484:59.71]No, I didn't.
[485:06.12]I knew what it was.
[485:07.04]Whatever.
[485:07.38]I don't even care.
[485:08.22]It's fine.
[485:08.68]It's fine.
[485:11.40]Thank you for the $1, though, and what a weird dream.
[485:15.08]Thank you.
[485:15.44]Jerma is the best for the $1 New Year's.
[485:17.48]Means a new anime, Jerma.
[485:18.64]You better watch JoJo on your anime for the year fans will get mad at you.
[485:24.12]If I don't.
[485:26.40]We'll see.
[485:26.76]I have to deduce what the anime of the year is going to be.
[485:33.26]But thank you.
[485:33.70]Thank you, Bofurs, for the $5.
[485:35.86]Really liked your outfit last stream.
[485:37.16]It had that about-to-announce-the-new-Xbox feel.
[485:45.06]Thank you.
[485:50.11]Kali Brady gave $100 eight hours ago.
[485:52.39]Long time ago, but holy shit, thank you so much.
[485:57.31]Happy New Year to you.
[485:58.35]Thank you Divas for the three bucks.
[486:00.69]Stix Renegade for the one dollar.
[486:01.95]Just like last year, can you wish me a belated birthday?
[486:05.03]Xmas boy over here.
[486:06.67]Also, you still have to draw my fursona.
[486:11.07]Well, happy birthday.
[486:16.16]first of all.
[486:18.30]Merry Christmas.
[486:19.08]Happy birthday.
[486:19.76]Happy New Year.
[486:21.60]And I can't draw.
[486:22.56]I'm not very good at it.
[486:25.38]Thank you, those sticks.
[486:27.30]Here's to another year.
[486:29.16]Solid milk, thanks for the $1.
[486:30.42]Don't be a weenie.
[486:31.26]Do hard mode.
[486:32.18]No.
[486:34.20]No, I just wanted to have fun.
[486:35.89]And it was still, like, challenging.
[486:37.75]First playthrough, right?
[486:39.29]You know, it's okay.
[486:44.45]They age?
[486:44.79]That's kind of ridiculous.
[486:45.83]I didn't know that they aged.
[487:14.76]That's really cool, actually.
[487:17.86]Hey, P337R, thanks for the $3.33.
[487:19.43]They say, hey.
[487:19.93]Hey, P337R.
[487:20.53]How are you?
[487:20.89]He doesn't even get older.
[487:35.85]Dragonflyer, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[487:37.45]Happy New Year, Jerma.
[487:38.21]Can't wait to see you at PAX Weest.
[487:40.96]Jerma Payne.
[487:42.72]I don't know if I'm gonna be going to... I don't know if I'll be at PAX West.
[487:46.54]I'm not sure where I'm gonna go.
[487:48.92]It depends.
[487:49.62]I don't know.
[487:50.48]I really don't know.
[487:51.28]Maybe... He said East, not Weest.
[487:59.41]He very clearly wrote Weest.
[488:02.25]W-E-A-S-T.
[488:07.21]That could be either one.
[488:11.79]Why would I add a W to PAX East?
[488:18.24]ChoBlueMan, I did.
[488:21.02]Did it not go into the Twitch chat?
[488:22.16]I just posted it here already.
[488:27.82]But I don't know, we'll see about conventions.
[488:33.57]It depends on a bunch of different factors, but thank you, Dragonfly, for the $10.
[488:42.80]Thank you, Hero of Trains, for the $1.
[488:46.56]R.I.P.
[488:47.02]Jex 2018.
[488:47.36]What?
[488:50.78]What?
[488:55.03]Come on.
[488:57.13]Jex is just fine.
[489:00.51]He was just sleeping tonight.
[489:03.73]Dark Star, thanks for the $1.
[489:05.03]I'm so fucking jazzed you're playing this game.
[489:07.20]Just remember the fundamentals of CQC.
[489:11.62]I did, and then I lost it, and then I got it back again.
[489:14.63]It's a fun game.
[489:17.09]C4G, thanks for the $2.
[489:18.53]Rules of nature.
[489:21.68]And then they say rage.
[489:28.26]Thank you.
[489:30.16]Sly161, thanks for the $1.
[489:31.28]Is this the guy who died to Metal Gear Ray in Metal Gear Rising?
[489:39.10]Uh, you don't want me?
[489:48.72]Oh, it's a new, it's a new, you're saying, yeah, I get it.
[489:54.49]Uh, thank you, Boomer.
[489:56.21]No, that's not your name.
[489:56.97]It's Bossmer.
[489:59.38]Thank you, Bossmeroya.
[490:01.86]For the $10...
[490:05.30]Thank you so much for 10 bucks.
[490:06.38]Hey Jerma, I was busy on New Year's Eve.
[490:08.76]I wasn't able to watch the stream live, but I watched the VOD last night.
[490:11.42]It was a great stream.
[490:12.72]But when I went to bed, I had a horrific nightmare when my hair was replaced with your hair.
[490:18.11]It was very messy and I couldn't get it to look good, so I locked myself in the bathroom and freaked out while everyone outside was confused.
[490:23.85]This is not a joke.
[490:25.05]This was the actual dream.
[490:26.31]Your hair gave me a nightmare.
[490:28.55]Looks good though on you.
[490:31.54]Alright, you can't, first of all, you can't say, your hair gave me a nightmare, and then say, but it looks good, don't you?
[490:43.23]That's contradicting statements, but... Thank you, Bossmer, for the ten bucks.
[490:49.29]Sorry about your dream.
[490:52.53]Mostly lost, thanks for the one dollar.
[490:53.82]Local streamer isn't sure if there is stealth in a Metal Gear game.
[490:58.97]But there is- no, there isn't- here's how you tell if there's stealth in a video game.
[491:02.37]There was no stealth in that game.
[491:04.23]I'm sorry.
[491:05.44]There wasn't.
[491:06.86]Where was the crouch button?
[491:08.96]If a game has stealth, it has a crouch or a duck and walk slow button.
[491:19.16]There was no stealth in that game, there was walk.
[491:22.02]That's not stealth.
[491:26.93]It's called using the box.
[491:28.64]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[491:29.76]I'm sorry, that doesn't count.
[491:32.50]The box does not count as a crouch.
[491:40.39]How doesn't that count?
[491:42.93]Because.
[491:45.21]That's, you're putting yourself into a box.
[491:49.15]There is no push in L3 and you go down and you're creeping around.
[491:55.71]That's an item.
[491:56.63]That's an emote.
[491:58.49]That's an emote dance from Fortnite, is what that was in this game.
[492:10.35]That's how it was in the other Metal Gears.
[492:11.66]No, it wasn't?
[492:12.72]In the other Metal Gears, you could go up against the wall and go... Huh?
[492:19.38]Where was my whistle?
[492:20.04]Where was my knock?
[492:30.88]You crouch down in the box.
[492:52.83]Hey Hydra, thanks for the one dollar.
[492:54.05]These bits are for the Jeremy buys a new suit that actually fits Foundation.
[493:03.49]Who wears, I don't know, I don't wanna, I'm not gonna wear a suit.
[493:06.11]Why do I, why, no.
[493:10.60]I don't need a suit, I got a perfectly good suit.
[493:16.20]Thank you.
[493:17.40]Hydra.
[493:18.66]I will put that into the, into the box.
[493:22.41]Which I am crouching in apparently, which means it's a stealth game.
[493:27.05]God.
[493:30.17]I'm getting tired and you can tell because I'm just being fu- I'm being just fucking strange.
[493:34.37]Thank you, WildHike, for the 10 bucks, PogChamp.
[493:40.33]Thank you, Wild, for the 10 bucks.
[493:45.88]You never apologized for being mean to us.
[493:47.62]I was not mean to anybody.
[493:49.06]I- you- I said something about an enemy in the game and it happened right after.
[493:56.90]Right after.
[493:58.84]We talked about how chat was yelling at me to do two different things.
[494:05.28]You hate us.
[494:11.79]I still can't get over that.
[494:13.61]Wild, thank you for the $10, $15, $16, $17, Wild.
[494:17.70]Go buy a slice.
[494:18.72]I will.
[494:21.54]I am hungry.
[494:22.38]So that's definitely something I'm going to do.
[494:26.09]Hawkeye of mine, thanks for the $2.
[494:27.69]What's with this game and using feet for swordplay?
[494:30.87]Chat, you know what to do with this.
[494:32.45]Kappa.
[494:36.04]I don't... I don't know what to do with that.
[494:37.82]I don't know what he means.
[494:41.54]What do you mean?
[494:45.51]Hey, Luckybone, thanks for the $30.
[494:47.31]We got you earlier, but thank you so much again for the $30.
[494:52.10]Your accidental bits.
[494:53.64]I'll take them.
[494:54.22]Thank you.
[494:55.52]Really appreciate it.
[495:00.58]A dapper dog.
[495:01.38]Thanks for $1.
[495:02.16]Jerma, this is one of my favorite games ever.
[495:03.84]I'm so excited you're streaming it.
[495:04.82]PS, thanks for being amazing as always.
[495:06.44]Keep being you.
[495:08.92]A lot of people really, really like this game, huh?
[495:11.96]Judging by how many people like this game, I'm surprised they did not do anything else with the game.
[495:19.88]I mean, I guess the two DLCs.
[495:26.52]Is it really a scenario where Konami just doesn't get it?
[495:31.38]And they just make slot machines?
[495:33.08]You guys know that, right?
[495:41.69]Yeah.
[495:45.11]Yes, we know.
[495:46.23]That sucks.
[495:49.75]They have a lot of great franchises.
[495:55.46]The developer of the game said they'd love to make a second and Konami said no.
[495:58.50]It's weird.
[496:03.97]But thank you, Flugboy, for the $1.
[496:05.85]Hey, Jerma, hope you're having a great start to the new year.
[496:08.60]My friend, and hey, you know, speaking of new year, I heard you have one anime per year threshold, so I think it's time of year for you to catch up on a little show called JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[496:21.06]Also, not just part one, every part.
[496:24.64]Love you dearly, Jerma.
[496:25.76]Sorry I've only been given a dollar lately.
[496:28.80]jermaHeart.
[496:30.73]No, don't.
[496:32.83]Don't apologize for giving me money.
[496:35.43]Don't apologize for giving me money.
[496:40.02]That is a huge gesture to give a stranger on the internet money.
[496:46.26]It means a fucking shitload to me.
[496:47.80]Don't worry about that.
[496:50.18]And I use the word stranger.
[496:51.58]I mean, I mean that like physically, you know what I mean?
[497:05.06]Because obviously a lot of you guys have been around for a long time, but I mean that in a literal, physical way.
[497:11.41]You're giving somebody money.
[497:12.55]And you're hanging out here, and we're having a good time.
[497:17.01]Don't feel bad about that.
[497:18.45]Don't feel bad that you're not giving me enough money.
[497:25.85]If you want to give me bits or subscribe to this channel, thank you.
[497:31.80]But I really hope you guys don't feel fucking bad.
[497:36.23]Oh, is it enough?
[497:36.85]It's got to be more than that.
[497:37.79]No, no, no, no.
[497:39.47]It doesn't.
[497:41.65]Thank you.
[497:50.39]Jerma is physically strange.
[498:02.45]I really, truly hope that you guys don't feel like that.
[498:07.03]Because if you give somebody $10, $20, $1, $50, $100, that's a big gesture to that person.
[498:16.39]It is.
[498:20.25]The fact that you would even think about doing that in the first place.
[498:26.89]I don't collect this money and go, well, I mean, I've got to use a little more.
[498:34.03]No, no.
[498:38.39]Thank you.
[498:45.26]KXE, thanks for the 30 bucks.
[498:54.74]Victory bits.
[498:55.40]$30 from KXE.
[498:57.24]Somebody just gave 50, I think, right now.
[498:59.73]Yeah.
[499:01.29]Fitty gave $50. $50.
[499:04.36]You got a lot of accounts.
[499:05.02]Thank you for $50.
[499:38.81]It's a lot of money.
[499:40.21]Thank you.
[499:41.00]Thank you, Fitty.
[499:42.42]And keep up the great work.
[499:44.92]And tomorrow, you know, when I come back on Saturday, make sure to talk about, like, talk about fucking, talk about, like, Bazooka Joe again.
[499:51.14]You know what I mean?
[499:51.64]And I'll, like, bring it up and we'll talk.
[499:52.84]It would be funny.
[499:59.54]Thank you so much for the $50.
[500:04.42]KXE, yes.
[500:05.44]Victory Bits, thank you for $30.
[500:08.45]Great Canadian FK Club, thanks for the $5 and your community subs.
[500:11.67]Thank you so much.
[500:12.59]They say Frank or Z. Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[500:19.45]Hey, P-E-T-E-R, you're that ninja.
[500:27.21]That spells something, but thank you.
[500:31.48]Thank you, Nick, for the $1.
[500:32.98]Rules of nature.
[500:34.78]Thank you.
[500:36.80]I've figured out what that is.
[500:38.10]It's a song, I think.
[500:40.40]Alec.
[500:40.66]Thank you, Alec, for the five dollars.
[500:42.44]I just thought of a very uncomfortable event.
[500:44.12]Imagine biting the side of your fork and expecting food, but just tasting metal in pain.
[500:51.93]That's not... That's not a good thing to think about.
[500:53.63]It's like chewing on tinfoil.
[501:01.06]Ugh.
[501:03.33]Chew it on tinfoil with fillings.
[501:04.75]It, like, electrocutes you.
[501:07.69]Alright, why did I just say that?
[501:10.75]Ah, okay.
[501:11.19]Thank you, Alec, for the $5.
[501:18.02]By the way, don't do that.
[501:19.24]That's bad.
[501:20.80]Do not do that.
[501:21.86]It's time for slime.
[501:22.60]Thanks for the $5.
[501:23.02]I was devastated during the New Year's Eve stream when chat almost voted Bugleberry for worst new character.
[501:29.81]I had to make this and share it.
[501:31.59]Would deeply appreciate if you played it while chat spams jermaPluto.
[501:40.94]What do you mean?
[501:41.82]Let me see.
[501:42.26]What is this?
[501:51.46]Well, don't spam it yet.
[501:52.42]You haven't seen anything yet.
[501:53.43]Hold on.
[501:53.81]Don't spam it yet.
[501:59.00]And no one knows what it's like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes And no one knows what it's like To be hated To be faded To telling only lies
[502:43.20]Bugaberry's not going away.
[502:45.50]See, something, a little tidbit of information that you guys need to know.
[502:50.39]I love that character.
[502:52.47]I love that character.
[502:55.71]It's like my favorite character.
[503:08.58]Actually, it makes me laugh that so many people are like, fuck this guy.
[503:13.96]You know how much fun I had on that first stream?
[503:17.05]Hiring him, having him come and do that.
[503:23.29]That was just fun.
[503:24.33]It was fun.
[503:27.97]Probably gonna fucking do it again.
[503:35.62]Thank you, Time for Slime, for that touching video.
[503:40.99]The $5 mask you bought at a pharmacy for Halloween?
[503:43.47]That mask was not $5.
[503:44.73]Add a few zeros.
[503:51.13]No, that means it's $5,000.
[503:52.13]That mask was not $5,000.
[503:54.37]That mask was $5,000, okay?
[504:05.10]I'm going to get my money's worth out of that character.
[504:10.68]Hey, thanks Peaceful Haley for the $1.
[504:14.48]Hey Jeremy, just wanted to know how you were doing and also just wanted to let you know how amazing your community is.
[504:19.57]And the friends I've made here on Discord, on here and on Discord.
[504:23.69]And the people who come over and watch my stream feels good when I can entertain others.
[504:28.25]And that's all thanks to you or else I wouldn't have known what to do with myself.
[504:32.09]So thank you, Jeremy.
[504:32.83]You're awesome.
[504:37.03]I fought for a long time to even have that Discord.
[504:42.63]Because I wasn't sure if it was something I wanted to do.
[504:44.69]Do I want to have a Discord?
[504:46.31]But people do Discords.
[504:47.37]Do I have to pay to Discord?
[504:49.11]No, no.
[504:49.65]Why would I do that?
[504:50.65]Like, subrooms, channel, how do I even manage this?
[504:53.77]Like, I didn't know if it was something I was going to do.
[504:58.55]Because it's hard to do that.
[505:00.03]I mean, as much as it's easy to be like, I have a Discord and go there and whatever.
[505:04.67]Managing something like that with thousands of people is actually hard to do.
[505:08.93]So you can thank the mods.
[505:11.69]for being around all the time to take care of that and to make it so much easier to have that.
[505:19.25]Because I'll be very Frank with you.
[505:21.25]If the mods in this community were not on top of their game every day, that Discord does not exist.
[505:29.49]I wouldn't be able to have it.
[505:32.55]I've tried before to have communities.
[505:34.51]I've had groups.
[505:35.49]I've had, oh, let's just set up this thing and maybe I can, like a Steam group and shit and I never can manage it.
[505:52.37]Without them, there is no Discord.
[505:55.23]And I'm really glad that it can exist.
[505:57.50]Because messages like this prove that it's worth having.
[506:01.28]For sure.
[506:08.08]No, right.
[506:08.90]Music's not playing.
[506:09.48]But thank you, PeacefulHaley.
[506:13.60]Appreciate it.
[506:16.31]Uh, Yakko Boo.
[506:19.11]Thank you for the one dollar.
[506:21.87]No message.
[506:22.71]Thank you, uh, thank you Yakko.
[506:25.63]Alec, thanks for the two bucks.
[506:26.67]When are you gonna play Ocarina of Time?
[506:28.37]I'm probably not gonna play Ocarina of Time on stream.
[506:36.83]Probably not.
[506:38.87]If I was to do a Zelda game on stream, it would probably be Breath of the Wild.
[506:44.11]But even that's kind of a long shot at this point.
[506:50.92]So if I was to play a Zelda game, that would be the one that would be played.
[506:57.14]But why?
[506:58.96]Oh, because it's a pretty huge time commitment.
[507:03.30]I played a lot of Red Dead and I streamed a lot of Red Dead.
[507:07.67]And isn't Breath of the Wild a huge game?
[507:15.87]This stream, this community, I feel like, and I'm like this too.
[507:20.89]I don't really like to have, oh yeah, Breath of the Wild, Breath of the Wild, Breath of the Wild, because when I get into a game, I want to play it.
[507:28.24]But I don't really like streaming a game more than four, five, six times in a row.
[507:35.82]And then if I leave it, oh, I'll come back to it.
[507:38.22]There's all this shit that's going on, more ideas and more games, and I never usually go back to it.
[507:52.10]Yeah, I would say play Breath of the Wild on your own and maybe stream it once or twice.
[507:54.94]That's typically how it goes.
[507:57.59]I'll play a game that's like Breath of the Wild, like A Red Dead, like... There's a lot of other ones that have been in that similar realm.
[508:06.19]Play it on stream a few times, maybe three or four times, and then... Alright, that was cool, I'm gonna finish it on my own.
[508:12.92]So, that's definitely possible.
[508:22.25]Please go back to Red Dead, though.
[508:24.07]I beat the game off-stream.
[508:28.05]I completed Red Dead Redemption 2 off-stream.
[508:37.41]Betrayal.
[508:41.49]It was great.
[508:44.33]Did you finish everything?
[508:45.17]Oh, I finished everything.
[508:46.31]Everything.
[508:49.28]I love Rockstar games.
[508:51.90]So...
[508:54.41]I did all the story and I did all the side stuff.
[508:57.87]I didn't do all the hunting stuff, though.
[509:00.87]But I did, I think, pretty much all the dialog content that's in the game.
[509:12.33]To be honest, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[509:13.48]Definitely worth keeping some games to yourself.
[509:17.22]Yeah, I mean, this could bleed into a conversation about the game that you saw tonight.
[509:25.28]It's a different... When I play a game off stream, it's a lot different.
[509:30.42]You know, I'm just kind of sitting there.
[509:32.24]And I'm not really talking, I'm just enjoying the game and having fun.
[509:37.28]I'm not really speaking or anything.
[509:40.58]Actually, I have some trouble, especially with games that require a lot of attention, and this is because of my uncontrollable ADHD.
[509:49.50]looking at chat, and talking, and, and, let's talk about this thing, and this thing, and it's, it's kind of, it's, I like having, you know, the off-stream, sit there with my mouth open, type of, uh, type of experience.
[510:02.90]And you can't really do that on stream.
[510:05.50]I can't really sit here, and just, like this, for like 40 straight minutes.
[510:17.57]That's another five community subs from Soft33.
[510:23.07]Thank you, Soft, for the five community subs.
[510:29.68]Surprised and glad you have time to play games on your own and with how much you put into your streams.
[510:35.98]Yeah, but remember, I want this... I want each stream that I do to... engage and talk and hang out and interact with you guys and...
[510:48.50]Sometimes it is nice just to turn off my brain and just not just sit there.
[510:53.25]And, you know, play a game like Red Dead for like six straight hours.
[510:59.84]It's just eating fucking chocolate, you know what I mean?
[511:09.76]But, yeah, it is, but there's another thing though, this is why it's kind of a double-edged sword, because in games, a lot of times I'll be playing a game just alone, in the dark, with the headphones on or something, and all of a sudden something fucking hysterical happens, or something awesome happens, and I'm looking around, I'm just like, wait, did anybody see that?
[511:30.56]Nobody's in the room.
[511:31.42]Oh, I saw, it was awesome, I should have been streaming this!
[511:35.72]You know what I mean?
[511:36.38]It happens a lot.
[511:47.69]I think there's a balance somewhere.
[511:52.26]Bixby, start game record.
[511:58.54]How many Jex moments happen in private?
[512:01.50]I mean, I could tell you how many.
[512:02.90]I could say, oh, it happens all the time, but you're not gonna believe me.
[512:06.03]You know, oh yeah, you know, you should have seen when I was playing off stream.
[512:09.99]I didn't saw, I did all this cool shit.
[512:12.63]It's like, okay, sure you did.
[512:19.03]But it's all good.
[512:20.73]It's all good.
[512:29.61]But thank you.
[512:31.59]Thank you.
[512:32.01]Ike Turtle for the $1.
[512:32.63]It's how I rub Jerma nose wipe.
[512:35.35]Here's a sewer dollar.
[512:36.91]What's a sewer dollar?
[512:48.34]Thank you AzuriteReaction for the $1 chat.
[512:50.68]Maybe if you guys stopped spamming 40 things for him to do, he would actually be able to notice a single thing in the game.
[512:56.94]And maybe if you stopped spamming shit, then it would actually be a surprise to him instead of spoiling it 20 minutes in advance.
[513:16.79]20 minutes in advance.
[513:27.17]Thank you, Azerite Reaction.
[513:31.41]It's alright, though.
[513:32.37]I mean, like, I... Yes, sometimes I do look over and I see three or four different things for what you're doing.
[513:39.59]You need to do that.
[513:40.18]You gotta do this.
[513:40.72]You have to do this.
[513:41.22]What are you doing?
[513:41.84]Why are you going that way?
[513:42.62]Go the other way.
[513:43.46]That weapon sucks.
[513:44.26]And it's just like, I just, I don't know.
[513:46.54]What?
[513:49.12]Oh, I...
[513:57.01]but that's just that's just what happens though it did you know it back seating it's not even no it's alright
[514:13.84]Can... And, like, I get it.
[514:15.56]Like, if I'm not doing something right, or if I'm fucking up and doing something wrong and I'm not learning it, yeah, it probably is frustrating to watch.
[514:21.67]But it's also frustrating for me, too, because I want to figure it out.
[514:26.67]But I don't want to have to figure it out where it's a detriment to the stream.
[514:33.38]You know, if I spend 50 minutes trying to figure out how to block somebody, it's like, fucking Jesus, Jeremy, give me a break.
[514:40.84]But...
[514:47.06]The game, the gnome porn links got old.
[514:58.45]Spoilers are shit though, really hope people can avoid that stuff.
[515:02.45]I didn't really care, I mean, the one, the only thing that I kind of was just like, oh, okay.
[515:08.28]Was when everyone was screaming about the cat.
[515:15.55]So, I mean, that's the only spoiler I really think I received during the stream.
[515:19.73]Maybe a couple other things too, but... I don't know.
[515:24.41]At the end of the day, people are just trying to have fun.
[515:33.03]Ruined that cutscene about memes.
[515:34.79]Yeah, but... It's alright.
[515:50.70]I was not, that was not making me frustrated.
[515:53.54]What was making me frustrated was the game.
[515:56.96]You know, it's a tough game.
[516:00.50]I don't think it was anything in chat that I was like, shut up everybody!
[516:04.29]I think it was one time, maybe, where I was told to go in four or five different directions.
[516:13.50]You're too forgiving, you need to punish your chat more.
[516:21.01]But punish for what?
[516:23.78]You know, start punishing for stuff like, you suck at the game, or, hey, you went the wrong way, or spoilers.
[516:31.58]I mean, a lot of people would be on that list to, uh... What, am I gonna ban them?
[516:40.33]If I ban somebody every time somebody told me that you're doing it wrong, I think half the chat wouldn't exist.
[516:59.90]There'd be nobody there.
[517:08.12]The mods would even get banned.
[517:10.22]That's how you know.
[517:14.58]When it's unnecessarily rude, it can be kind of depressing.
[517:18.77]Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna lie.
[517:19.67]I'll be completely open here.
[517:21.41]Sometimes I'll look over and it's... I read something and it's just like, oh, fuck, that person's
[517:28.64]is really fucking mad at me right now, and somebody's saying something fucking mean and shit, and it's just like, God, I wish I could... I really, I don't want you to be saying that.
[517:45.44]That doesn't happen that often, though.
[517:48.28]I would say if I stream... There's 365 days in a year.
[517:51.74]If I stream 100 days a year...
[517:56.64]If there's like 125, 130 streams a year, maybe like three or four of those streams, I will actually look over and be like kind of depressed or annoyed by something.
[518:11.09]Doesn't happen that often.
[518:29.29]And 99.9% of the time, we're just having fun.
[518:36.15]I've spent a lot of time on this topic, but I think it's worth talking about.
[518:44.33]Like somebody saying that I suck?
[518:45.71]No, no, no.
[518:46.42]Because I know that that's...
[518:48.58]You know, I do dumb shit in games all the time.
[518:50.84]That's not what I'm talking about.
[518:52.10]I'm talking about, like, something really mean that's, like, a full-on, like, sentence about how something I'm doing is so stupid or I'm such a piece of shit or something and it's just, like, fucking hell.
[519:14.32]Mr. Jerma, can you yeet?
[519:22.17]Anybody who complains about Bugleberry gets me like that.
[519:30.70]And it's so easy.
[519:31.70]Let me tell you, it's so easy.
[519:34.16]It's such an easy out to say, Oh, fuck the haters.
[519:39.02]Fucking haters.
[519:39.86]Fuck the haters.
[519:41.00]But that's a person with an opinion.
[519:44.79]And they have it for a reason.
[519:46.55]You know?
[519:47.37]I don't, I hate being that kind of person that's just like, Fuck the haters!
[519:50.81]Who cares?! !
[519:52.47]Yeah, fucking hater.
[519:54.39]No, that person has an opinion.
[520:02.94]And what am I going to do?
[520:15.43]Yeah, but their opinion is wrong.
[520:19.05]No, if somebody comes in here and doesn't like what I'm doing, then that's... I'm not going to be mad at that person because they don't like what I'm doing.
[520:28.02]That's it.
[520:31.10]They'll move on and that's it.
[520:32.32]I'm not going to be like, Oh, you didn't like what you see here?
[520:35.08]You're a fucking little baby.
[520:36.95]And let me tell you that you're a little baby.
[520:41.65]No, sorry I didn't think it was fun.
[520:43.63]Maybe you'll check back again another time.
[520:58.84]But this is a pretty long-winded comment about all this.
[521:05.12]This is a cool heart-to-heart.
[521:22.54]Yeah, it's... Sometimes we do these.
[521:27.48]Sometimes you just gotta talk
[521:30.38]It's all fun and games, but... You know, we're all people here, so... And right after that... Roger Cheeto, thanks for the one dollar.
[521:49.90]You missed the memes, stop talking during cutscenes, dumbass.
[521:54.54]Hey!
[522:06.20]The timing, the timing was impeccable.
[522:10.46]But thank you for the $1.
[522:19.64]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.
[522:21.76]Because you're apparently incapable of processing two things at once.
[522:26.32]Here's the memes cutscene.
[522:39.65]Thanks for the doll, I've mostly lost.
[522:45.82]Let the roast continue.
[522:58.89]Protect him.
[523:03.14]No, that's funny.
[523:03.90]That's funny.
[523:04.52]I mean, if I had looked over and saw that like four hours ago, because I was already like, the game was like, I was getting kind of mentally fatigued.
[523:12.31]If I looked over and saw that, I would have probably been like, okay, fine, fine.
[523:18.61]No, it's all good.
[523:21.23]Thanks for the dollar, you guys.
[523:35.52]Speaking of dollar, thank you for real though for the one dollar.
[523:37.38]Watch this.
[523:37.84]No, this is not something that will get you in trouble.
[523:41.71]I love the... The context has to be there.
[523:48.91]Ah, there she is.
[523:49.97]I'm the captain of this ship.
[523:51.47]There's a storm a-brewing.
[523:53.30]Get back.
[523:54.24]Get back.
[523:55.24]Yo-ho-ho in a bottle of Zima.
[523:59.54]I've been drinking Zima for years.
[524:01.92]Get back.
[524:02.76]The seagull's everywhere, biting and stinging my face.
[524:09.61]I'm getting seasick.
[524:10.95]He's fucking crazy, man.
[524:18.54]I can't hold my liquor.
[524:22.82]He's just, like, puking.
[524:30.44]Thank you.
[524:30.86]It's not gonna get you in trouble.
[524:31.82]Nah, it's not.
[524:36.01]Thank you.
[524:37.79]Thank you, Ooshie Corn, for the one dollar.
[524:45.91]It's gonna be the last season of Eric Andre?
[524:47.85]Is it really?
[524:50.17]Well, I guess maybe... He's been doing other shit, though.
[524:53.05]He's been on other TV shows that aren't the Eric Andre shows.
[524:57.57]So he's probably... He's branching out a lot.
[525:05.89]Thank you, Ushicorn.
[525:08.53]Thank you, uh... Thank you, Kilgannon, for the $1.15.
[525:11.12]I got fired today!
[525:14.50]I'm sorry.
[525:15.66]But I've decided to use this time to pursue something more creative.
[525:18.96]I just wanted to ask, when you started making videos, did it terrify you that everyone would hate what you'd made?
[525:26.02]No.
[525:28.46]Because... I wasn't making videos.
[525:36.06]I wasn't making videos... I don't think... It's just kind of hard to describe and explain.
[525:45.25]But I wasn't making videos to try to get, like, an audience.
[525:50.08]I was kind of just doing them.
[525:52.04]It was a way for me to pass my time, and... I thought they were fun, and... It wasn't really in the back of my mind of, oh, somebody's gonna hate this.
[526:00.70]I was just kind of doing it.
[526:08.60]It really didn't... It took probably, like, 20 or 30 videos.
[526:11.42]Because remember, I had no expectations at all.
[526:16.09]Zero.
[526:16.93]Absolute zero.
[526:19.09]If I got 20 viewers, it was like, oh, that, whoa.
[526:22.50]Okay, where are they from?
[526:23.78]Well, this is cool.
[526:31.14]So when your intentions are not to, I guess, when your intentions aren't to necessarily...
[526:39.67]have an audience you really don't mind or don't necessarily care who comes across it because you're doing it because you want to make them not necessarily to have a bunch of people and watch my first 10 20 videos it's just me just talking and being like weird and saying like strange and just doing nothing
[527:14.61]But now, I don't think that the words not terrify.
[527:23.90]But I don't want people to hate the things that I make.
[527:27.72]So I try as hard as I'm able to, to try to do as best as I can.
[527:33.04]Because I, in my heart and in my brain, think that the best that I can is hopefully good enough.
[527:41.65]I think everybody thinks that.
[527:42.49]Everybody just hopes the best that they can is good enough.
[527:57.46]And there are people... There's a bunch of people here now that I know already kind of get it.
[528:04.55]Because they've been here for so long.
[528:07.07]It's a weird...
[528:10.05]it's a weird thing where made videos for years didn't really have that many expectations I wasn't like partnered on youtube for it took like 150 videos I think more than like at least 50 to 100 before I had any money at all from youtube and there's a bunch of people here that just that a lot of people just kind of get it and they think the things are fun and
[528:36.18]You guys are a part of the joke as much as, you know, for the half the shit that is done on this stream.
[528:46.74]I don't get it.
[528:56.67]Did you lose the password to your main channel?
[528:58.51]I know it's a meme, but I'm really curious.
[529:00.97]I've talked about it a bunch of times before.
[529:04.05]But YouTube just wasn't
[529:07.47]It just wasn't doing it for me anymore.
[529:11.33]And I mean that in a bunch of different ways.
[529:12.91]Creatively, monetarily, that's back when YouTube changed a lot of shit.
[529:18.58]There was a lot of subscription shit that they were changing, there was a bunch of ad revenue stuff that they were getting rid of, and it was hard to... Let's say if I was gonna spend like a week on a video.
[529:32.12]It just really wasn't possible anymore.
[529:38.98]So I didn't lose the password to my main YouTube channel, I just stopped using it.
[529:45.05]Because I started losing interest, and Twitch seemed like the next thing that I wanted to try to do.
[529:49.87]I don't know what the next thing will be.
[529:54.21]But I'm not going to force myself to make a video just because I like have to.
[529:58.38]That's not going to happen.
[530:01.26]If I am not wholeheartedly enjoying everything that I'm doing, it'll show.
[530:06.84]It'll just be forced and I don't want to force stuff.
[530:09.17]I'd rather have it come naturally and have fun.
[530:24.91]Natural raw Jerma.
[530:30.22]I've told you guys this, you know, over the last two, three years on Twitch.
[530:34.04]If what I'm doing is not something that I'm having fun doing and enjoying doing and having, you know, more ideas are coming out.
[530:42.15]Because remember on YouTube, there was a lot of things I wanted to try and a lot of things I wanted to do.
[530:45.99]And now that's, I have that same itch on Twitch.
[531:03.80]On... Itch on Twitch.
[531:05.12]Nice rhyme.
[531:10.43]You ever thought about saying that on the main channel?
[531:11.89]I know some people who didn't even know you streamed and just thought you kind of disappeared.
[531:16.70]Yeah, I think part of me in my brain somewhere kind of doesn't want to make that video.
[531:24.60]Somewhere up in my brain.
[531:26.70]I don't want to tell people.
[531:28.74]It's over here.
[531:29.84]It's on Twitch.
[531:30.80]See you on Twitch.
[531:32.42]There's a weird lock in my brain.
[531:33.74]Because that's such a huge portion of my life.
[531:37.68]It's like this door that's still up there.
[531:42.67]I know there's a monster in that room.
[531:46.57]But I don't know what to do about him.
[531:47.83]He's just in there.
[531:50.29]I can't let him out.
[531:55.20]He'll eat me.
[532:06.72]Just tell him about the second channel.
[532:09.02]Yeah.
[532:10.74]I've thought about it.
[532:15.25]But I mean, that's another thing too.
[532:18.27]Don't pissing people off and
[532:21.11]Making a video on that main channel saying, hey, by the way, I know it's been a couple years since you last seen me, but I'm done!
[532:27.76]Uh, isn't that like kind of... You made, you waited two, you waited two years to make a video saying that I'm done on YouTube?
[532:37.26]Hey guys, when was the last time you heard my voice?
[532:39.88]Hey, it's a new upload from Dremadon85.
[532:43.16]Here it is!
[532:44.24]Okay, uh, I'm done.
[532:50.42]It's kind of pointless, in a way.
[533:00.36]I gotta go.
[533:00.82]I gotta get out of here.
[533:08.98]But closing that door is... I don't think it's even necessarily necessary.
[533:15.58]Because I don't know.
[533:18.50]A year or two from now, a couple years, I don't know.
[533:20.34]Who knows?
[533:20.76]Maybe I will want to go back to YouTube and make more video content.
[533:26.59]Actual edited video content.
[533:28.47]I don't know.
[533:30.99]I never had a plan.
[533:33.55]I don't have a plan.
[533:36.48]You know?
[533:37.74]There's no, here's the plan.
[533:39.94]Nope.
[533:46.57]I have plans week to week and month to month.
[533:49.87]If I have something that I'd like to do on stream, or back when I was making YouTube videos, I got plans to do content and do things.
[533:58.98]But long term of where I want to be and what I want to do, not really.
[534:02.84]Just wherever the wind takes me is what's going to happen.
[534:11.70]What would you do if streaming was no longer profitable?
[534:15.68]Um...
[534:17.55]something else you know because you have to remember I'm 30 I'm turning 34 this year so I mean I wouldn't just disappear but at some point I I gotta do if I wasn't doing streaming or youtube or something I would have to do something else
[534:48.77]I wouldn't stop streaming.
[534:50.65]But it wouldn't be a scenario where it was, you know, three, four days a week.
[534:54.47]Or four, five, whatever days a week.
[534:56.29]For eight, nine, you know, this is a nine hour stream.
[534:58.67]It'd be shorter.
[535:00.17]It would be maybe once or twice a week.
[535:02.31]When I had time.
[535:03.01]If you stopped now, what would you do?
[535:12.49]Huh.
[535:18.49]That's a tricky one.
[535:19.33]That's a really tricky, that's a tricky question.
[535:25.29]Street magic.
[535:32.64]Um... Probably something with animals.
[535:40.50]I'd go get like a vet tech.
[535:43.36]I'd go back to school probably and get a vet tech degree or something.
[535:53.10]Because I did just about a year stint at an animal shelter, and it was great.
[536:00.85]I would do that for a job.
[536:03.87]Without doubt.
[536:13.00]As a person who runs a rescue and as a vet, I approve.
[536:20.46]Yeah, no, I... Animals are awesome.
[536:23.41]I would do it.
[536:27.75]You going to school to be a vet tech right now?
[536:29.91]Let us know how it goes.
[536:31.82]Because that's probably what I would be doing if I wasn't doing this.
[536:40.53]I feel like maybe I'll still do it anyways.
[536:42.69]You know what I mean?
[536:43.29]I'll be one of those people that's in their 50s.
[536:46.91]And just decides, you know what?
[536:49.77]I'm just gonna go work at a zoo.
[536:52.37]I don't even care if I'm like the guy.
[536:53.95]If I'm the guy that's like cleaning up after the animals and refilling water dishes and shit.
[537:00.26]Cool.
[537:00.90]That's fine with me.
[537:14.33]PogChamps.
[537:19.62]Be the guy from up and sell balloons.
[537:29.85]Just buy a farm somewhere and produce milk.
[537:34.31]Probably.
[537:36.17]Why not?
[537:47.63]Farming is back-breaking work.
[537:49.69]Yeah, I know.
[537:50.45]I'm just throwing out random shit right now.
[537:54.27]When's the next episode of JermaCraft coming out?
[537:57.17]Um... I'm sorry to say, but it has been canceled forever.
[538:09.32]This is long-winded.
[538:12.15]Very long.
[538:13.23]Started with chat.
[538:15.11]And I moved into milking.
[538:17.33]Somehow.
[538:24.56]But kill Ganon.
[538:28.66]Thank you for the dollar fifteen.
[538:29.64]And I'm really sorry that you got fired today.
[538:32.70]Hopefully the decisions that you've made and the things you're going to pursue make you happy.
[538:40.61]Thanks for the dollar.
[538:43.58]We're still on me, yeah.
[538:44.73]Yeah, yeah, I know.
[538:48.99]I know.
[538:49.17]One at a time.
[539:09.48]He'll look into it.
[539:10.24]Well, I look... Hey, listen.
[539:12.22]I looked into Metal Gear Rising for a long time.
[539:18.14]Bunch of people have said to play that game.
[539:20.65]On stream.
[539:23.11]And I looked into it enough to play it.
[539:29.01]Getting close.
[539:29.69]Getting close.
[539:30.15]Not very many more bits.
[539:36.69]Thank you G Floater for the $5...
[539:40.89]Meme has more than just the internet meaning.
[539:44.23]It comes from Richard Dawkins.
[539:47.12]The word meme is a shortening modeled on gene of meme-y, an imitated thing.
[539:55.90]Coined by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles.
[540:08.41]The memes.
[540:11.62]That's a, well, thanks for the piece of, uh, historical scientific data.
[540:15.38]G. Flota, thank you for the five dollars.
[540:19.48]Mediocre Bloke, thanks for the one dollar.
[540:21.16]Pac-Man made fun of me and I feel sad.
[540:22.90]Help me.
[540:24.02]Pac-Man can't talk.
[540:26.67]That's how I know what you just said is bullshit.
[540:29.43]Thanks for the dollar, though.
[540:32.57]Uh, Sugar, thank you, Sugar Shin, for the one dollar.
[540:35.79]Hey, Yerma.
[540:37.16]Been loving all your streams, and I just want to show you my Boston Terrier.
[540:40.98]Her name is Missy, and she is a good pup.
[540:46.47]Oh, this is a broken link.
[540:48.05]Oh, that's not good.
[540:49.07]I think I can fix it, though.
[540:51.39]Maybe not.
[540:56.47]Can we get the pup back?
[541:02.76]Because I can't... I can't get this...
[541:08.04]Streamlabs does this weird thing when you try to copy something, it just copies the entire page.
[541:13.22]The entire message, and it's impossible to deal with.
[541:16.91]A virus dog.
[541:18.45]No, no, no, no.
[541:21.23]Uh, if you can get me the link again, Sugar Shin.
[541:26.37]I can't really get it copied.
[541:29.52]But, thank you for the, if you're still here, thank you for the $1.00.
[541:39.30]AceMcLace, $100, 10,000 bits.
[541:43.26]An hour ago.
[541:45.66]That was right when I beat the game.
[541:46.80]Thank you.
[541:48.52]For that huge amount of fucking money.
[541:51.81]SmarkyMC, thanks for the $5.
[541:53.21]Hey Jerm, love you.
[541:54.01]Can you end the stream out on this?
[541:57.19]It depends.
[542:03.53]This is a Metal Gear Rising remix.
[542:16.79]You know, it's not a... not a gnome.
[542:18.23]Eh, why not?
[542:20.51]Sure.
[542:21.11]It's lowered a little bit though.
[542:34.34]Thank you, Mad47, for the $5.
[542:35.83]Hey, man.
[542:37.37]Hope you enjoyed Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
[542:39.37]I got two questions.
[542:40.77]Are you going to play Kenshi Saturday whenever you stream?
[542:43.57]And would you consider playing the other Metal Gear games if they get hit by a sale?
[542:47.93]Metal Gear series is a favorite of mine, and I'd love to see my favorite streamer play them.
[542:50.78]Thanks for the fun, man.
[542:51.86]Love you.
[542:57.36]Probably not... Probably not Metal Gear Solid 1, 2... I mean, 3 is...
[543:04.75]Three's pretty interesting.
[543:06.41]Three might be worth a stream.
[543:07.69]They all might be worth a stream.
[543:11.16]Probably not.
[543:15.90]This game was a good one stream, one long stream.
[543:23.04]Three is the best one.
[543:23.98]Yeah, that's why three might be worth streaming.
[543:28.07]Did you never really play 4?
[543:29.27]No.
[543:29.87]I actually think I played the first 20 minutes of 4 and somehow just did not play anymore.
[543:37.59]I had not played 4.
[543:45.65]But thank you, Matt.
[543:46.61]It was a great game.
[543:49.24]I had a lot of fun.
[543:52.68]I am Monk.
[543:53.08]Thanks for the $1.
[543:53.76]This game sucked.
[543:56.69]Play I Am Bread.
[543:58.01]I Am Bread.
[544:00.11]What is this, like... Is this 2013?
[544:02.98]It is, because we just played Metal Gear Rising.
[544:05.86]So, it might be 2013.
[544:06.94]YouTube.
[544:14.01]Tuber Game.
[544:20.29]Thank you, uh... Jack?
[544:23.53]Thank you, Jack, for $1.
[544:25.69]Thanks for getting me interested in the Metal Gear series.
[544:29.05]Anytime, Jack.
[544:30.75]Metal Gear's a great series.
[544:36.66]You're gonna love it.
[544:38.26]If you've never played any of the Metal Gears before,
[544:41.82]That's quite an adventure to go on.
[544:45.01]If you start at... Well, where would you start?
[544:47.65]Would you start at 1?
[544:48.93]Or would you... I don't know.
[544:51.25]Do you Phantom Menace this shit?
[544:53.49]Start at 5?
[544:53.79]What do you think?
[545:01.11]Or would you just go through the whole thing?
[545:09.96]Release order is the best for new players.
[545:11.86]Just go 1 through 5.
[545:12.78]Yeah.
[545:15.96]Gonna come back to Kenshi?
[545:17.28]Probably, yeah.
[545:18.48]At some point over the weekend.
[545:22.56]I started at 5 and never finished it.
[545:24.40]5's a very large game.
[545:25.34]A lot going on.
[545:31.22]He said PS2 night.
[545:32.54]Yeah, no, I know.
[545:34.84]I'm going three days in a row.
[545:36.71]I'm going Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.
[545:38.61]And then, depending on how I feel, maybe Tuesday.
[545:43.19]So, we're going three days in a row.
[545:49.15]But, uh, good luck.
[545:50.17]Jack, it's a great series.
[545:52.61]DubskiDude, thanks for the $1.
[545:53.91]So glad you played this.
[545:54.71]Revengeance is my number one favorite game that I never played.
[545:57.21]The Raiden vs. Armstrong scene inspired me to do my first and only studio-grade dub-over.
[546:04.13]At least in my opinion.
[546:05.49]So this game is pretty special to me.
[546:06.93]Glad you didn't get too frustrated with it, Nogo.
[546:08.67]Drink some brain fluid, you hobbit.
[546:17.23]No, I didn't.
[546:18.11]There was a... I got frustrated for about 30 minutes.
[546:21.33]40 minutes, maybe, during that stream.
[546:25.71]Not that much, though.
[546:27.16]It was a level... It was a very containable level.
[546:36.92]Thank you for that video.
[547:07.02]who are do you hope to see in smash DLC crash bandicoot hint no I mean I would love to see I'm not I I'm not gonna no I'm not gonna say it everybody thinks I'm gonna say a certain character no at this point no banjo kazooie would be great I'd love to see banjo return to a Nintendo console
[547:36.09]He was going to say Gino?
[547:37.11]No, I mean, no.
[547:43.19]I'd love to see Garfield.
[547:45.68]Iconic video game cat.
[547:48.82]I'll give you an off-the-wall one here.
[547:52.70]Scrooge McDuck.
[547:55.52]Get Scrooge McDuck in there.
[547:58.55]He would be perfect.
[548:08.53]You can't tell me that Scrooge McDuck would not fit in that, especially really, really popular old retro game that was on the regular Nintendo.
[548:17.80]It was an awesome game loved by millions.
[548:20.90]His moveset, it just made itself.
[548:24.12]The pogo, the bang, bang, bang.
[548:26.53]He's got the, his side smash could be the cane swing.
[548:30.77]He's got the whole thing.
[548:32.83]The little gems, he could throw money out and shit.
[548:47.49]Maybe.
[548:49.91]But that includes Disney.
[548:51.59]And if Disney's gonna get included, then Sora's gonna be put in the game.
[548:54.72]It's not gonna be anybody else.
[548:57.42]If there is gonna be a big Disney Square or something DLC, it's gonna be Sora.
[549:05.48]And I don't want it to be.
[549:11.19]But it makes the most sense.
[549:14.59]Kingdom Hearts is right on the horizon.
[549:22.33]Square doesn't own Sora, Disney does.
[549:25.07]That's not like a joint partnership?
[549:26.53]Square does not own any of those characters.
[549:28.31]It's all Disney.
[549:29.52]Really.
[549:35.10]But there you go.
[549:35.74]Scrooge McDuck or Banjo.
[549:38.86]Kazooie.
[549:41.40]There's your answer.
[549:44.05]Thank you... No...
[549:48.15]Thank you, Nosporosbones.
[549:55.15]I am absolutely destroying your name right now.
[549:59.74]But you gave $15 about 45 minutes to an hour ago.
[550:03.08]Thank you.
[550:09.84]Hey, the Jerma longtime lurker here.
[550:11.78]Been watching for about five years and never has your wonderful content disappointed.
[550:19.69]Thank you.
[550:25.23]That's a long time to... That's five years of lurking.
[550:30.17]Well, good to see you.
[550:32.57]Thank you for sticking around for that long.
[550:34.53]Thanks for the 15 fucking dollars too.
[550:36.61]Much love.
[550:38.68]A five year lurk.
[550:43.94]That's a long URL.
[550:45.64]Yeah, what is that URL?
[550:49.27]Never answered.
[550:49.89]Why does he hate Kingdom Hearts?
[550:51.99]What?
[550:54.45]I love Kingdom Hearts.
[550:56.85]I like those games.
[550:57.75]When did I say that?
[551:05.97]I don't hate those games.
[551:10.40]Why is it telling me that I'm leaving Facebook?
[551:13.44]I don't know.
[551:14.86]No links.
[551:16.54]Oh, there's a dog link?
[551:21.06]Look at that.
[551:21.60]That is the dog link.
[551:27.94]Oh Look at what was that?
[551:30.34]Was that was that a french fry?
[551:33.52]I just love these French fries.
[551:34.46]They're the most delicious things ever Scrunchies It's a cute dog
[551:54.52]You guys don't think I do that voice when I- anytime I look at my dog?
[551:59.82]My dog will just look at me and I'll just start talking as if I'm him talking.
[552:03.15]Why do we do that?
[552:03.95]What's wrong with human beings?
[552:07.15]Every time we see an animal, we talk out loud as us talking, pretending to be the animal talking.
[552:19.01]Why?
[552:25.38]I don't do that?
[552:26.40]That's just you?
[552:27.37]What?
[552:27.61]I think that's just you?
[552:36.42]It's like a baby voice with infants.
[552:39.52]Yeah, but with a baby voice with infants, you're not going like this.
[552:42.95]Hello, yes, it's me, the baby.
[552:44.51]I'm the baby, and yes, I'm so cute.
[552:46.19]And I, oh, I just burped.
[552:47.15]I'm the baby.
[552:47.73]You know, you're going, oh, hello, baby.
[552:49.81]You're the baby.
[552:50.87]Yeah, no.
[552:52.03]When you do a dog, you go, it's me, Otto.
[552:54.92]And I love to eat.
[552:55.58]He's crunchy, delicious, crunchy.
[552:56.66]He's like, that's what you do.
[552:58.50]Nobody says, I'm the baby.
[552:59.68]Nobody says, they do it with a dog.
[553:07.69]Because we wish that they could talk.
[553:09.15]Because that's what we hope that they would say.
[553:13.41]That makes sense.
[553:16.33]There's a good take on that.
[553:27.14]I'm the baby.
[553:30.60]Thank you, though.
[553:31.28]Thank you, Star Wars 3.
[553:34.52]Episode 3.
[553:36.40]Return of the Sith.
[553:39.08]Thanks for the $1.
[553:39.72]Thanks for playing one of my favorite games ever.
[553:40.96]I almost got the achievement for S-ranking Revengeance Mode, but I fucked up once in Denver and it was all over.
[553:47.06]You could totally do Hard Mode, though.
[553:50.76]Wow.
[553:51.58]S-rank on Revengeance Mode.
[553:55.12]That sounds pretty insane.
[554:01.09]Daniel, well... Yeah, I thought it was great.
[554:08.35]I thought it was great.
[554:10.79]I can't even do hard on Bayonetta.
[554:18.75]These games are really, really fast-paced.
[554:23.23]I don't know how people can go over, like, hard, very hard revengeance.
[554:26.39]It takes dedication and pinpoint accuracy and complete and total locking in.
[554:35.00]I just like burped really loud and the fucking music's off so you heard it.
[554:39.36]Great.
[554:40.26]See, usually this music is on and you can't hear the fucked up gross noises that I make.
[554:45.13]And now you heard that one and now whatever.
[554:51.93]Thank you Articus for the one dollar.
[554:54.51]Metal Gear may be over but its memes will live on.
[554:59.85]Darkstar, thanks for the one dollar.
[555:01.15]Oh no, someone just linked a picture of Jerma's asshole.
[555:08.99]Eternal Woe, thanks for the $1.
[555:10.37]I'm sorry.
[555:11.93]Don't be sorry.
[555:13.91]Dark Star again, thanks for the $1.
[555:15.27]I'm sorry.
[555:15.75]I'm so sorry for giving you money, dear God.
[555:17.53]I need to repent for the sin of giving you money.
[555:20.09]I should have given a hundred gift subs.
[555:22.75]I'm sorry for this measly coin in the coffer.
[555:26.59]Oh, right.
[555:27.49]That's what we're... Parfallum, thanks for the $1.
[555:31.71]Alright, Jerma, I'm setting aside my dignity to talk about anime.
[555:36.33]Okay.
[555:36.47]Okay.
[555:37.57]It was great.
[555:38.29]Already seen it.
[555:38.88]Already watched it.
[555:39.90]That cannot be on the 2019 one anime a year list.
[556:09.33]What about Samurai Champloo?
[556:10.39]Already seen it.
[556:16.12]I saw that back when it was airing on Adult Swim every night.
[556:18.88]Or every Saturday, whatever.
[556:20.52]Years ago.
[556:26.46]Death Note.
[556:27.26]No.
[556:28.38]No, I don't think so.
[556:35.15]It doesn't do it for me.
[556:46.42]Original Dragon Ball.
[556:48.48]Not too old.
[556:52.93]Too old.
[556:55.49]Come on, give me some more.
[556:56.33]Castlevania.
[556:58.61]That's a pretty good one.
[556:59.61]Already seen it.
[557:05.97]Berserk.
[557:06.37]Already seen it.
[557:16.53]One Punch Man.
[557:17.69]Ooh!
[557:19.27]Yeah!
[557:21.59]I've seen a few episodes.
[557:23.13]I gotta finish that for 2019.
[557:23.99]There it is, One Punch Man's the anime.
[557:25.82]I'm gonna finish and watch the whole thing.
[557:38.57]Nice.
[557:39.01]Okay, nice.
[557:42.12]I mean, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, I'm sure it's a great show, but there's like 600 episodes.
[557:47.71]I know, I'm not gonna watch 641 episodes.
[558:05.88]Hey, MostlyLost, thanks for the $1.
[558:07.42]It's 2019 and you still haven't turned off autoplay on YouTube.
[558:11.92]But what if there's a fun video afterwards?
[558:19.06]What if I miss out on something I never would have seen?
[558:20.80]Hey, Fitty, thanks for the $5, Fitty.
[558:24.14]As well as your $50.
[558:27.27]So, $55 from Fitty.
[558:32.38]Thank you so much.
[558:38.57]So here is the message you wanted me to send.
[558:40.61]Hey streamer, read this entire thing on stream.
[558:45.88]Why are you linking me a Medium article?
[558:49.76]What the hell is this?
[558:50.56]It's an article from Medium.
[559:02.00]He paid me.
[559:03.06]What?
[559:04.50]Is this a virus article?
[559:12.86]Read it all.
[559:17.14]What even is this link?
[559:18.26]Link.medium.com What is this?
[559:35.68]how to build a brain interface and why we should connect our minds.
[559:42.61]I'm not going to read this whole thing.
[559:48.61]Communication helped humanity progress to where we are today from evolving the ability to speak and understand gestures to building tools such as writing instruments to printing press, radios, computers, internet.
[559:56.34]Now I'm present in the majority of humanity's technology and creative output requires dexterity.
[559:59.52]This is a great article.
[560:02.44]This article is like 641 episodes long.
[560:11.63]I don't know.
[560:11.97]I don't have a good time for this.
[560:19.18]Pretty interesting stuff, though.
[560:20.08]Connecting your brain to, um... To the... Network, or something.
[560:31.49]Thank you, Fitty.
[560:32.37]Seriously, for your $55.
[560:34.69]I really appreciate it.
[560:36.61]Thank you, Lockyman, for the two bucks.
[560:38.23]Have you ever done improv in school?
[560:40.37]No.
[560:42.98]No, I've never done stand-up, never done improv, never... No.
[560:45.82]No.
[560:47.94]Outside of being on stream, this is the only... Why is the PlayStation 4 on?
[560:53.94]I didn't turn that on.
[560:59.78]But no, I've never done improv or anything.
[561:01.60]Thank you, Dr. Epic Frag for the $1.
[561:06.13]Bixby, tell me a short joke.
[561:08.49]I don't have Android, so that's not gonna work.
[561:11.77]Is that how that thing works?
[561:14.19]Hey, Alec, thanks for the $1.
[561:15.43]Jeremy, you ever played a Zelda game?
[561:16.87]Oh, yeah.
[561:17.35]Yeah.
[561:19.28]Played most of them, actually.
[561:22.16]A Dr. Epic frag.
[561:23.96]Thanks for the $4.16.
[561:24.68]But seriously, can't thank you enough for all the funny gamer things you do.
[561:31.65]TF2 till now, you never get old.
[561:34.13]P.S.
[561:34.39]Thank you for playing Enter the Gungeon.
[561:36.25]It's become one of my favorite games after watching highlights of you with it.
[561:43.13]Wow, that's a really specific one stream.
[561:45.65]Well, I'm glad that you enjoy the game.
[561:52.97]Thank you for your more than... five dollars here, thank you.
[562:00.83]Classic video.
[562:02.21]Oh, it's a classic.
[562:02.95]It's happened, yeah.
[562:05.25]Not that frequently.
[562:06.13]That happens... usually at a convention.
[562:24.09]Maybe once a year.
[562:32.79]But no, I mean, I'm... I don't really put myself out there very much.
[562:39.26]Like, I don't, I mean, conventions and shit, I do, like, a little meetup, I'll put, like, a tweet out, but I've never really done, like, a Twitch-sponsored kind of meet-and-greet where you wait in a line or something like that, so there really only is one way you can ever see me at a convention, and that's if you see me on the floor, or if you happen to come to the, you know, and I tweet out where I'm standing for, like, an hour, you know what I mean?
[563:11.04]It's cool, though.
[563:11.80]It's really interesting when that happens.
[563:13.78]You just really never expect that.
[563:18.30]The couple of times that it's happened outside of a convention, I really was just never expected that to happen.
[563:25.37]There's so many people on Earth.
[563:34.17]But thank you, DCB, for the $1.
[563:35.95]How do you feel knowing your viewers will literally pay $1 to roast you on stream?
[563:42.13]I mean, it's okay.
[563:43.72]How do I feel?
[563:44.40]I mean... Damn, you're right.
[563:55.29]It's all in good fun.
[563:55.91]I also just want to say thanks.
[563:57.93]I've been going through Benzo withdrawals for the last month and a half.
[564:08.89]And your streams are just about the only thing keeping me sane.
[564:11.71]Probably have heard your voice more than my own voice last year.
[564:18.40]I'm really... I'm sure that's fucking horrible.
[564:28.78]But thank you for the dollar.
[564:30.24]Thank you for being around.
[564:35.19]I can't imagine what that's like.
[564:50.68]Hopefully you get through it.
[564:51.42]Stay strong.
[564:56.67]You'll do it.
[565:03.01]Much love to you.
[565:03.73]For real.
[565:04.93]Take care of yourself.
[565:10.46]And thank you so much for the monetary contributions.
[565:21.06]Only about five more left.
[565:22.88]We will round out this nine and a half hour stream.
[565:27.32]I wanted to go long tonight though, because I knew I wasn't going to be around for the next couple of days.
[565:34.46]That's why I'm still doing the stream, you know?
[565:37.93]You know?
[565:38.15]You know what I mean?
[565:38.59]You know?
[565:39.03]You know?
[565:39.29]You know?
[565:40.49]Turn it into earnest.
[565:43.66]Uh, synthesize Pandabot.
[565:45.27]Thanks for the $1.
[565:45.65]Hey, Jerm, what do you think of, uh, scat?
[565:48.81]Skibby-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-dibbity-
[566:04.05]It's Rizgar.
[566:04.65]Thanks for the $1.
[566:05.35]Hey, Germboy.
[566:06.23]Might have zoned out, but I think you skipped my bits earlier.
[566:09.35]Either way, wanted to know if you would consider or desire to show up on another podcast or something.
[566:12.89]Thought it was hilarious when you were on Critical's podcast.
[566:20.81]I mean, not necessarily.
[566:24.34]I mean, I just end up being invited on some things sometimes.
[566:28.04]Yeah, I guess I'll do it.
[566:37.11]I don't have any intention to go on podcasts or kind of IEC the collab with X or collab with Y, you know?
[566:51.70]It just happens sometimes.
[567:00.13]Did Drake call back yet?
[567:01.39]Yeah, I buttoned him.
[567:03.71]Didn't even let him ring once.
[567:05.23]It was like,
[567:07.15]Done.
[567:07.97]I caught it immediately.
[567:16.97]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[567:19.51]Thank you, Boss Baroya, for the $1.
[567:22.55]Durham, a serious question this time.
[567:25.06]Do you have any advice to give to a perfectionist?
[567:28.18]I often feel like if I don't do something to the fullest of my abilities, there's no point in doing it at all.
[567:33.44]It can be a suffocating and depressing way to view the world, but I don't know how to drop it.
[567:37.18]P.S.
[567:37.46]Your hair does look good.
[567:39.17]I'm just used to short hair and couldn't handle the change.
[567:43.83]Advice for a perfectionist.
[567:47.67]Accept the fact that you trying your best is good enough.
[567:57.32]You have to accept the fact that it can't be perfect.
[568:03.84]I have to come to terms with this kind of shit all the time.
[568:08.06]Whether it's in your daily life or, you know, something with the stream that I want to do.
[568:15.27]Nobody is Superman.
[568:18.95]It's impossible to hold yourself to that kind of a standard.
[568:29.07]Except my dad.
[568:32.35]Well, alright, except your dad is Superman, but not everybody's dad is Superman.
[568:46.36]But as long as you get what you're doing to a level that you think is good.
[568:59.32]You know, you can do something to the fullest of your abilities.
[569:03.68]But fullest of your abilities does not always necessarily have to mean perfect.
[569:09.69]You can be really good at something, but it doesn't have to be perfect every time.
[569:27.20]Not perfect?
[569:36.01]What is perfection?
[569:41.03]That's a whole nother story.
[569:42.79]That's a whole nother conversation, but... Allow yourself to have faults.
[569:48.32]Otherwise, you'll just drive yourself crazy.
[569:56.31]But thank you, hopefully that helps.
[569:59.73]Uh, almost done.
[570:00.92]DZBill Chow Tun... Chun... Chun... I can't read this name.
[570:09.20]It's too late.
[570:11.93]Thank you for the $1, though.
[570:20.91]Hey Jerm, I've been watching you since your TF2 days.
[570:22.49]I just want to say I love your content and everything you do.
[570:24.13]Keep up the good work.
[570:25.55]Thank you.
[570:25.83]I'm going to call you DZI.
[570:27.51]I'm going to call you Dizzy.
[570:30.11]Thanks for the $1.
[570:32.61]Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.
[570:33.79]What would you say makes one successful in life?
[570:37.65]Also, Fitty is a cool person.
[570:38.91]What makes you successful?
[570:43.32]Whatever you want that word to mean.
[570:44.82]It doesn't mean the same thing for everybody.
[570:50.77]It's an impossible question to answer.
[570:57.65]It's a different answer from every single person to person.
[571:09.43]What do I think?
[571:10.47]What do I think is successful?
[571:17.55]I asked you.
[571:20.74]Yeah, but you said, what would you say makes one successful, not you successful?
[571:25.80]Right?
[571:28.20]That's a good politician answer.
[571:32.90]Well, no, that's true though, because think about that.
[571:35.58]I'm not going to go into a long-winded response here because it's late for a lot of people, but what I think is, let's say you have a goal, right?
[571:49.09]I want to do this I want this to be this means that I did it I made it or uh this is why this is my success is here that's not the same for somebody else they could it can be completely different things Jerma is the villain you know what makes you success his mode makes you successful successful are you are you happy with what you're doing
[572:17.52]That's what I feel like is success to me.
[572:21.37]Did you accomplish something that you are happy with?
[572:24.90]Done.
[572:26.12]Doesn't fucking matter what it is.
[572:35.32]Thank you, Jack, for the $1.
[572:36.52]If the donations keep coming, he can't end the stream.
[572:38.36]Not if I go faster.
[572:39.49]Flying Sombrero, thanks for the $1.
[572:40.61]I just want to say how much I love you in this chat.
[572:42.83]Unlike many streamers, you make us feel like we're part of the stream, and I love that.
[572:45.96]I also like how we can abuse you, and you still love us, because we all love you, tiny man.
[572:52.64]I'm glad you have fun.
[572:54.14]That's the intent, and hopefully it stays that way.
[572:56.51]Thank you, Fitty, for the $1.
[572:57.71]You can't end the stream if you keep donating.

[573:22.67]I met him at PAX.
[573:24.13]Keep doing you.
[573:25.31]You're the funniest person in the world in my opinion.
[573:28.81]That means a lot.
[573:29.33]Thank you.
[573:30.41]Thanks for the $5.

[573:38.18]Can we bring back Orson Welles' subsound for the weekend?
[573:42.96]No, we can't.
[573:44.30]We can't do that.
[573:48.30]Thank you, though.
[573:51.02]For all those credits.
[573:53.29]Thanks for all the subs.
[573:56.83]I just... Oh my goodness.
[574:02.43]You guys are fucking awesome.
[574:03.33]That's off-center.
[574:04.33]Needs to be moved over here.
[574:06.51]And made a lot bigger.
[574:09.30]Thank you, all of you.
[574:11.02]The hundreds of people that subscribe pretty much every stream.
[574:15.22]And stay subscribed.
[574:17.42]For years.
[574:21.81]Thanks.
[574:23.95]Still not centered?
[574:24.75]I got you, I got you, I got you.
[574:29.01]Dragoon893, thanks for the $1.
[574:31.47]Hey, Jerma, have you seen Into the Spider-Verse?
[574:33.54]If not, you totally should.
[574:35.14]It was an incredible movie with really cool visuals and great music.
[574:38.95]Miles Morales, best Spider-Man, by the way.
[574:42.33]I have not.
[574:42.75]I heard it was really, really good, and I'm absolutely going to see it very soon.
[574:46.31]Heard it was great.
[574:48.03]So, yes, I will definitely watch it.
[574:50.77]Alec, thank you for the $1.

[575:02.20]What?
[575:06.28]What are you guys doing?
[575:08.57]What does this shit even mean?
[575:14.77]I'm trying to decipher what that could possibly mean.
[575:20.18]The Hobby Wobby.
[575:22.22]I don't know what that means.
[575:35.80]Thank you Sandreg for the $1.
[575:37.28]If Orson is out, can we have a Paul Bearer subsound?
[575:39.54]The Paul Bearer subsound is like 27 seconds long.
[575:43.20]I can't bring that back.
[575:51.79]Exactly?
[575:53.83]Please, please, exactly.
[575:55.75]God.
[575:57.87]Damn, it's late.
[575:59.33]Almost 10 hours.
[576:01.39]I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[576:05.29]We'll do either Viscera, maybe some PlayStation 2, maybe some Kenshi.
[576:16.60]Take care, guys.
[576:19.60]And then right at the very end, we've got Fiddy coming in.
[576:21.64]$1.
[576:21.66]Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth at the gate outside.
[576:27.19]When they pull up, they get me loose.
[576:29.39]Do you have more, what is this, lyrics?
[576:37.78]Thank you, Tiger, for the $1.
[576:40.56]Guess I'll quickly jump on the love train before the end of the stream.
[576:42.64]You're my longest sub on YouTube.
[576:44.52]Been with you since TF2.
[576:45.48]My longest sub on Twitch.
[576:46.70]Coming up on two years.
[576:48.32]And I just want to say thank you for everything you do.
[576:51.56]Everything you do for us, shows, and all the hilarious content you bring us.
[576:54.62]Week in and week out.
[576:55.66]Thank you for everything.
[576:56.54]Really is appreciated more than you'll ever know.
[576:59.85]I'll flip that statement around and pretend that I just said that.
[577:05.92]That's how I feel as well.
[577:07.02]So, thank you.
[577:12.67]Jack at the very end.
[577:14.31]Thanks for the $1.
[577:15.25]And then, like, the SpongeBob I'm bending over text.
[577:19.35]Why don't you play TF2?
[577:23.06]I don't know.
[577:23.40]I'm just not doing it right now.
[577:25.54]You know?
[577:25.76]I don't know.
