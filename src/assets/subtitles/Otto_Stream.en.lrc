[00:41.79]Hi guys.
[00:43.67]Today, there's not supposed to be a stream here.
[00:46.03]There's just not.
[00:50.18]I have a little bit of apology for you today.
[00:55.44]"Ass hair."
[00:56.77]I haven't-
[00:57.47]Okay, I g-
[00:58.56]Listen, the microphone's
[00:58.56]down here right now.
[01:01.16]Listen to me:
[01:02.24]I haven't washed my hair in two days.
[01:05.44]I've conditioned it twice.
[01:07.26]I'd haven't done that because after VR,
[01:10.31]my hair gets wicked fucked up,
[01:10.31]and I'm afraid to wash it,
[01:13.48]because I'm afraid it'll fall out.
[01:15.12]So I haven't washed my hair in two days.
[01:18.32]I'm gonna do it today!
[01:21.44]Alright, so you're probably asking, why am I doing this?
[01:23.58]When I very, very clearly said that I was streaming on Thursday, well, I fucked up the sus.
[01:30.52]The sus said there was a stream today for the last two days.
[01:33.80]And I didn't even know there was a stream that was scheduled for today until like half an hour ago, 40 minutes ago.
[01:43.18]So, come on.
[01:43.98]What's this?
[01:44.66]Get up there like that.
[01:45.38]There you go.
[01:45.94]Now you look better.
[01:47.66]I didn't know there was going to be a stream today, but now apparently there is.
[01:51.89]I told you guys, anybody that was in the fake pre-stream chat that we were going to do an auto-stream.
[01:57.86]Sleeping right there.
[02:03.22]This is literally going to be like 30 minutes.
[02:04.78]I'm just doing this because I got guilt tripped by pre-stream because I, you know, this is a guilt trip stream.
[02:09.70]You got me.
[02:10.83]Chat, I'm not going to turn the stream on.
[02:12.43]I'm not going to do it.
[02:13.41]I'm only going to stream for like 30 minutes.
[02:14.91]Alright, maybe I'll do, yeah, that's fine.
[02:16.15]I'll do one stream for 30 minutes.
[02:17.33]Okay, well, two hours.
[02:19.01]No, chat, I'm not going to do two hours.
[02:20.37]Okay, I'll do three hours.
[02:21.83]Chat, I'm not going to do four hours.
[02:24.01]How about like a 24-hour stream?
[02:25.57]Well, is it okay?
[02:26.53]No, no, I won't do that.
[02:31.34]Didn't I actually say two days ago that I wasn't going to cave to things people said?
[02:36.81]I said this two days ago.
[02:41.94]I said, when I say goes, and then literally I'm turning on a stream on a day that I'm not supposed to be streaming.
[02:52.03]I don't know.
[02:52.47]Whatever.
[02:52.79]Alright.
[02:53.51]Anyways.
[02:54.37]Let's break this down.
[02:56.77]I have never done a stream where Otto just hung out right here.
[03:00.07]And the camera's never been pointed down here.
[03:02.09]You've never got a full body shot of Otto.
[03:05.21]Not for a long time.
[03:09.27]Let's see what happens.
[03:09.95]Ready?
[03:10.53]Watch this.
[03:14.94]Otto?
[03:18.20]Otto?
[03:18.56]Otto?
[03:20.84]Over there.
[03:21.54]Who's sleeping over there?
[03:23.12]Otto.
[03:24.78]Otto.
[03:34.37]Come over here.
[03:37.09]Go there, exactly.
[03:40.27]Here comes a full-body reveal of the dog.
[03:42.71]Oh, no, never mind.
[03:48.29]This is the only fucking time you're ever going to get this, by the way.
[03:52.01]I'm never doing this ever again.
[03:53.19]I'm only doing this because people bullied me.
[03:58.96]Let's just get up and leave.
[03:59.86]Show the dog?
[04:05.44]I have his favorite toys out there.
[04:07.18]He doesn't even know they're out there.
[04:12.68]Bullying works.
[04:15.82]No, it doesn't.
[04:17.20]I did this because I felt like it.
[04:23.74]Come over here.
[04:24.38]I set this up so you'd be seen.
[04:26.34]You're not even being seen right now.
[04:35.00]Come over here.
[04:35.36]Hey, lazy dog.
[04:38.11]Go over there.
[04:39.59]Right here.
[04:39.87]Go.
[04:42.07]Come here.
[04:46.23]Come on.
[04:48.03]I know what'll make you get up.
[04:49.95]Watch, he's gonna get up.
[04:57.49]Your toy.
[04:59.49]He'll move for his favorite toy, just you wait.
[05:02.53]It's the flamingo, see?
[05:05.95]Oh, dude, auto reveal.
[05:07.41]Is this what you want?
[05:14.41]Yeah.
[05:16.67]I have Mr. Flamingo.
[05:21.22]There he is.
[05:22.60]Finally, I reveal my dog after 12 years.
[05:28.70]He loves this thing.
[05:29.56]He's ripped the stuffing out of this thing like 10 times.
[05:31.22]A little chunky.
[05:35.67]Um... He actually has lost some weight, believe it or not.
[05:40.05]He's lost like 5 pounds.
[05:42.75]He was like 27 pounds.
[05:44.73]He was huge.
[05:46.67]Now he's 24 pounds!
[05:49.02]Which is still, he needs to lose a little bit more weight, but it's okay.
[05:57.15]Otto is perfect.
[05:57.75]No, he's not.
[05:58.71]Remember, he's a, uh, he's a dachshund mix.
[06:01.33]He's not a dachshund.
[06:05.48]He's a dachshund rat terrier.
[06:07.82]Shetland sheepdog chihuahua.
[06:10.08]It's been confirmed.
[06:11.94]That's been completely confirmed.
[06:14.53]I didn't get to, like, get the fuck out of the way.
[06:17.79]I'm just, like, shit on the carpet right now.
[06:20.39]Don't, oh, hey, hey, don't do anything that could get me, get daddy in trouble.
[06:26.16]Just like spins around and just like dumps right here.

[07:55.14]Alright, yeah.
[07:56.64]We'll have Otto do some tricks.
[08:00.05]By the way, he's one of those dogs that he knows like three tricks.

[24:21.25]There's never just been like an auto-cam for more than five seconds.
[24:31.76]Sometimes in bed, he'll just roll over like this and stay that way until you touch his stomach.
[24:38.07]He'll do it for an hour.
[24:39.39]He'll just be like, um, excuse me, you haven't fucking done it yet?
[24:42.93]It's been like 30 minutes.
[24:45.25]And then finally you'll do it, and then he's like, oh, okay, thank you.
[24:49.26]And then he'll put his arm down.
[24:53.73]Scratch the dog's belly.
[24:54.79]Pet the dog.

[34:33.98]Why do you have such an itchy belly?
[34:36.74]Oh, you know what?
[34:37.54]It's getting colder here.
[34:39.59]It's dry as hell.
[34:42.49]Somebody just said, you're fucked up, dude.

[35:44.16]Desktop.
[35:47.68]What's going on here?
[35:49.93]On the desktop, so what the fuck?
[36:10.17]You even, like, painted his... You even got his, like, hand in, like... Oh, we are T... We are T-9 minutes before the stream.
[36:28.62]I'm turning it off at exactly 45 minutes, by the way.
[36:31.18]Just in case... Otto, by the way, has left.
[36:33.39]Now you just got me.
[36:34.85]And only me.
[36:35.41]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[36:39.15]Look at the title.
[36:39.79]The title of the stream says 45 minutes.
[36:41.35]It doesn't say 30 minutes.
[36:42.25]It doesn't say 45.
[36:43.37]No, it says 45.
[36:43.73]It doesn't say two hours.
[36:46.69]You're always late, but you can end it right on time.
[36:50.95]I wasn't late today.
[36:51.73]Today was never supposed to happen.
[36:55.71]Look, I was just sitting here, and I looked over at my Discord, and I got a DM.
[37:01.14]Uh, from the hive mind dev.
[37:04.16]We were just talking just quickly about, like, updating each other about some things.
[37:08.14]And he's just like, oh, hey, man, can't wait for the stream today.
[37:11.19]VR is so cool.
[37:12.09]And I was like, what happened today?
[37:15.85]And then I went, and I, like, scrambled over here, and it was, like, 2.10 at that point.
[37:21.23]And I go into the chat room, and it's just, wham!
[37:25.42]It's, like, a thousand messages a second, and I'm just like...
[37:33.56]I was like, well, today, there's no stream today.
[37:36.42]And obviously, it doesn't matter if the sus was wrong.
[37:39.60]It don't matter.
[37:40.54]You were here for like an hour waiting for me to stream.
[37:43.36]And that's what the sus said.
[37:44.64]And I wasn't fucking here.
[37:46.13]So obviously, I look like the bad guy.
[37:49.47]I'm the bad guy in that point, right?
[37:51.09]I am the bad guy.
[37:52.17]I admit it.
[37:53.75]Then this is your, this is the sub Wednesday.
[37:56.13]45 minutes.
[37:58.85]This is Patreon tier fucking five, okay?
[38:02.98]All of you here had to give me $200 a month to do this stream.
[38:07.49]That's what this is.
[38:08.07]I have what?
[38:15.91]Auto fans.
[38:19.92]Oh, but for real, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[38:22.14]Blink, blink, blink.
[38:22.92]You know, I'll blink.
[38:24.38]Okay, but hold on.
[38:25.04]Let's like, hold on.
[38:25.82]Blink.
[38:27.02]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[38:29.90]Honestly, streaming like this every now and then is cool.
[38:38.22]What are you doing tomorrow?
[38:39.58]Watch Dogs Legion.
[38:43.88]Going to play more streamer life?
[38:45.26]Probably after Halloween, I would say.
[38:47.96]Once Halloween comes and goes, we'll do that.
[38:53.39]Or Nintendo Labo.
[38:54.29]Did they come up with another one?
[38:58.73]Is there a Nintendo Labo stream?
[39:01.43]Possible?
[39:02.53]Because the VR one was the last one, right?
[39:04.11]I already did it.
[39:06.53]Watchdogs, yeah, I don't know.
[39:08.05]Look, I don't have early access to Watchdogs.
[39:11.72]I'm probably only going to play it for like four or five hours.
[39:13.44]I don't know.
[39:15.44]I might love it.
[39:16.96]I'll tell you, I didn't love the first two, so I'm playing the third one.
[39:19.84]Third time's a charm, right?
[39:22.28]I played the first one and it was alright.
[39:23.60]And then me and Etalyx played the second one.
[39:26.30]And I remember just getting stuck in the ocean and falling forever in the ocean.
[39:29.88]The game was like fucked up.
[39:31.09]And I never played it again.
[39:33.01]So, yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.
[39:34.75]We'll try it again.
[39:35.31]Third time's a charm.
[39:37.09]Something on there.
[39:44.69]Lick Wailord.
[39:46.98]Oh, dude, wouldn't that be so gross?
[39:52.54]Get out of here with that fucking bullshit.
[40:05.52]Five more minutes?
[40:06.36]Count it down, here it comes!
[40:10.36]Oh, maybe I should do like a quick dance for ya!
[40:12.29]No, I'm not, this is not comedy mainstream.
[40:16.01]See, I am more than five feet tall, see?
[40:19.55]And I can prove it.
[40:22.01]See how fuckin' big this is?
[40:23.55]See, that's you!

[40:46.59]I hope so.
[40:47.59]Do you need any help with your book bag, son?
[40:55.07]How are you, by the way?
[40:59.07]Just cut the stream.
[41:00.08]Not until 45.
[41:03.24]This is a fetish stream.
[41:14.09]Oh no, your cock was out.
[41:17.31]I'm telling you, I've had nightmares before when I'm talking like this.
[41:20.69]And next week what we're going to do, guys, is we're going to make a dick.
[41:24.58]I've had a dream where that's happened and I freak out.
[41:28.01]Even though I know I have pants on, I have pants and underwear on.
[41:31.97]When I stand up, I'm just like, nah, be careful.
[41:34.69]What's that?
[41:36.63]I have like fully clothed person.
[41:39.13]It doesn't matter.
[41:40.71]Anytime, because I had two nightmares in a row about this.
[41:47.05]It'll happen one day.
[41:48.24]And that will be my final stream.
[41:51.60]And then I'll never see you again.
[41:59.41]Holy shit, that link.
[42:04.64]Oh, that link is getting removed.

[43:13.17]Otto!
[43:13.89]Otto!
[43:14.33]Quick, come on!
[43:15.35]Before the timer turns off!
[43:18.99]He doesn't care.
[43:19.97]He's done.
[43:26.08]You guys are so quick on these images, I swear to God.
[43:46.54]Okay.
[43:47.40]That's horrifying.
[43:51.58]The streamer is kind of short.
[43:52.88]I am a little short, but I'm not that short.
[43:55.82]I am 5'7".
[43:58.94]With 5'8", with shoes on.
[44:00.76]My official driver's license says 5'7 1⁄4".
[44:03.52]I'm 5'8 1⁄2", with shoes on.
[44:06.50]5 like 8.
[44:06.78]I just say 5'8".
[44:07.78]Who cares?
[44:08.24]Do you care that much?
[44:09.98]You're an inch taller than me.
[44:10.94]See?
[44:11.56]I'm huge.
[44:16.35]5'7 is tall.
[44:17.67]5'7 is normal tall.
[44:21.37]What about this link?
[44:24.68]Oh, yeah.
[44:28.34]It's me from, like, junior year of high school.
[44:39.27]Let's see how... I've shown this before.
[44:41.35]Look at how much I've aged.
[44:42.95]You ready for this?
[44:46.26]Hey, take a look at this shit.
[44:50.57]You want to see somebody that just has, like, wine in their blood?
[44:57.53]That's not me.
[44:58.31]Although, like, it could be.
[44:59.73]Look at that.
[45:03.76]Look at this.
[45:11.22]Excuse me, that was like 25 fucking years ago.
[45:25.48]It looks like five years.
[45:26.38]Yeah, that was like 20 plus years ago.
[45:29.58]I'm probably like 16 in this picture.
[45:38.36]Haven't aged a minute.
[45:39.40]Thank you.
[45:41.00]I missed it, by the way.
[45:41.82]It's 46 minutes now.
[45:43.52]Thanks a lot.
[45:44.98]Thanks a lot.
[45:46.76]We're in overtime.
[45:52.14]Aged like milk?
[45:59.24]Uh, if that milk happens to be cheese.
[46:06.58]Aged like cheese.
[46:07.39]I'll take it.
[46:08.79]Aged like cheese.
[46:14.19]Oh, by the way, I saw somebody call this my orangutan stomach.
[46:16.49]I mentioned that the other day and it was very hurtful.
[46:21.04]But funny.
[46:22.08]It was funny still.
[46:24.42]What the heck?
[46:29.43]Who said that?
[46:30.67]Who said, hey, who said that?
[46:32.19]Right?
[46:32.41]Where's Otto?
[46:33.35]He's got his claw.
[46:36.45]I'm sorry.
[46:37.11]I'm just kidding.
[46:37.81]I don't care.
[46:39.89]Alright.
[46:42.75]This is it.
[46:44.81]I'm going to do it at 47, because 47 is one of my favorite characters from Hitman 3.
[46:49.48]Can't wait for VR.
[46:50.18]Here it comes.
[46:52.28]Here it comes.
[46:54.18]Okay, wait.
[46:54.86]I need a longer outro than that.
[46:57.74]A little bit longer outro.
[47:10.51]Show your dog's feet.
[47:14.83]I've seen it like a thousand times.
[47:16.43]He was here for like 30 minutes.
[47:17.73]Nice talking to you.
[47:19.89]Yeah, I hope you guys enjoyed the Wednesday sub stream.
[47:22.81]Remember, every time... Oh, I hate it.
[47:24.81]I saw that.
[47:25.31]I saw that.
[47:26.43]Remember, every time you sub, we do a Wednesday sub stream where I hang out and play with my dog.
[47:36.21]Every Wednesday, you're going to see me.
[47:39.21]Jerma.
[47:40.90]And I play with my dog.
[47:43.10]On camera.
[47:47.91]But.
[47:49.39]You have to.
[47:51.13]So.
[47:54.41]Don't ever fucking say I'm not fucking talented.
[47:55.85]I can fucking do anything I want.
[48:00.60]Rerecorded.
[48:01.12]Alright.
[48:01.68]It's 49.
[48:01.94]We're going to end at 49 because I love the 49ers.
[48:09.38]No, 50, because that's how old people think I am.
[48:11.41]De-synced?
[48:14.45]Ah, something must be wrong with the fucking internet cord.
[48:18.06]Fuck the 49ers.
[48:18.72]I don't know.
[48:19.98]I haven't watched a single game of 49ers in my life.
[48:24.77]This guy's literally insane.
[48:39.50]What if I just... This guy's 50.
[48:44.53]Oh, he will be in about one minute.
[48:46.33]Just waiting.
[48:52.72]How the hell what?
[48:54.85]Oh, before we end, yeah, I'll see you tomorrow for Watch Dogs Legion.
[48:57.55]Remember, I'm playing Watch Dogs Legion tomorrow, and so is everyone else on the whole website, pretty much.
[49:04.51]But watch my stream, because I'm going to start probably three or four hours after other people have started.
[49:11.26]So I'm missing the boat by about four or five hours, probably.
[49:15.00]But watch my stream tomorrow.
[49:16.32]Watch Dogs Legion.
[49:16.72]We're going to do something funny.
[49:17.74]We're going to do funny stuff on the Watch Dogs Legion.
[49:19.68]There's going to be a grandma on it.
[49:20.78]I promise there's going to be a grandma.
[49:30.19]We'll wait for you.
[49:35.05]And I'm going to play on easy too, so remember, that's already putting me kind of down on the streamer list.
[49:41.52]I'm playing on like normal, and I'm probably going to miss a bunch of queues.
[49:45.50]Look at those nails, they're perfect.
[49:46.78]I'm going to watch other streamers play that game that everyone's going to play tomorrow.
[49:52.08]Only watch mine.
[49:53.21]Damn.
[49:58.73]Oh, we're going to do 5-5-5-5.
[50:01.35]No, that means 55 minutes.
[50:02.49]No, we're going to do 50... Uh... Attention span.
[50:09.61]Whatever.
[50:10.04]It doesn't matter.
[50:11.16]50... Hey, we're doing a 50-50.
[50:13.88]He could turn the stream off, but he might not at that exact time.
[50:17.18]It's a 50-50 shot here.
[50:18.56]Let's go.
[50:18.86]You ready?
[50:21.76]I'll see you tomorrow for Watch Dogs Legion.
[50:22.94]Watch my stream.
[50:24.07]Don't watch any of other people's.
[50:26.34]Watch my watchdog stream.
[50:27.94]If I hear that you watch somebody else's watchdog stream while I was live doing watchdogs, say goodbye to sub Wednesday with Otto.
[50:38.73]Here we go.
[50:41.07]Alright, bye.
