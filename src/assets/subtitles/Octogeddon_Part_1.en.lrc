[01:03.57]Hey, how are you?
[01:08.23]That's like a song.
[01:09.30]That was the breakdown for the latest song you hear on the radio.
[01:17.74]I got nothing.
[01:19.46]Currently... Alright, I've tried to... I made a weird cough.
[01:23.75]And I turned it into a joke.
[01:25.57]But it wasn't a joke.
[01:26.47]I was just trying to say words because I'm typing on Twitter.
[01:30.41]And the thing that I typed on Twitter was, at the same time, because remember my brain can't do like four things at once.
[01:36.67]H-G-G-P colon slash slash www dot T-I-T-A-I-T-H dot TV.
[01:46.28]Taich dot TV.
[01:49.08]God.
[01:51.50]Hold on.
[01:54.01]You just got, like, 20... I spread myself out, like, 20%.
[01:58.91]Every single direction right there.
[02:04.17]God, I really can't... I really shouldn't be that linked to the past game.
[02:07.48]The four swords.
[02:09.08]If you split me in four... Oh, boy, I don't know what you'd get.
[02:14.52]Let me think about that.
[02:19.14]While I make this tweet.
[02:21.08]What would happen if you split me into four different personalities?
[02:30.15]You'd get a shadow, Jeremy?
[02:31.51]I don't think you would.
[02:33.23]I think I'm too lazy to get a shadow version of me.
[02:38.42]They'll never be an edgelord Jeremy personality.
[02:41.52]They just won't.
[02:42.70]Because I'm too nihilistic in my approach to most things, so that person wouldn't care.
[02:48.29]I wouldn't care enough to be like, oh, I'm so deep and dark, I'm going to write poetry.
[02:52.93]I can't even rhyme.
[02:53.63]Why would I write poetry?
[02:58.49]Okay, but me just saying that, me just saying that I'm nihilistic is like that personality though, right?
[03:05.84]I just said how nihilistic my approach is to everything.
[03:10.54]That is being that character.
[03:12.10]That is that guy.
[03:13.12]So I am that guy.
[03:14.40]God damn it.
[03:16.33]Fucking... Anyway, hey!
[03:18.75]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[03:20.93]We're gonna be... I didn't even put fucking spray deodorant on.
[03:23.03]Hold on.
[03:57.11]Deodorant body spray.
[04:00.45]Feel the cool mist.
[04:04.88]And maybe some dumb girl will walk by you and... Throwing fucking trash.
[04:20.39]Hey, welcome to the stream.
[04:25.67]Do you guys remember those Axe commercials?
[04:28.73]Do they still make those commercials?
[04:32.77]Where it's like a girl walks by this dude that has Axe on, and it's like, holy shit, I want you as my new boyfriend.
[04:42.72]Are they allowed to still make those commercials?
[04:44.30]Because they were terrible.
[04:59.25]Devil pits to the chest.
[05:03.91]My father... God bless him, right?
[05:08.45]My father uses Axe.
[05:11.55]The Axe, like, spray the Axe body wash and shit.
[05:15.85]And it's just because... He just didn't even know.
[05:18.89]He went to, like, the supermarket and bought... He's just like, oh, I need some more shampoo.
[05:22.75]This is alright.
[05:24.47]And he likes it.
[05:28.29]My father fucking loves Axe.
[05:35.52]Alright, here we go.
[05:38.34]We have an extra special stream for you tonight.
[05:43.18]And by extra special, I mean... Octofucking getting!
[05:48.79]There it is.
[05:51.49]I need to turn this down a tad.
[05:55.17]Just for now.
[05:55.91]We'll turn it back up.
[05:58.77]Alright, let's explain what's going on here.
[06:01.45]So, Octogeddon is... Remember the Insane Aquarium stream, right?
[06:06.84]Plants vs. Zombies.
[06:07.94]Am I ringing any bells?
[06:10.04]Sesame Street.
[06:11.82]The guy that worked on Sesame Street.
[06:13.32]The guy that created... No, that's a lie.
[06:15.14]I'm kidding.
[06:15.44]That's not real.
[06:16.78]But the guy that made Plants vs. Zombies and Insane Aquarium made this game.
[06:24.98]Now, I didn't even know this game was coming out until like two weeks ago.
[06:28.92]The guy that made the game actually, like, contacted me.
[06:33.04]It was a very surreal experience.
[06:35.90]And he's like, oh yeah, Octogeddon's coming out.
[06:37.57]You want to play it?
[06:39.37]And I'm like, yeah.
[06:41.41]Yeah, I do.
[06:41.89]It even has the same font as Insane Aquarium.
[06:46.13]Yeah, it does.
[06:50.14]We'll see.
[06:52.79]I'm gonna give a will-see attitude towards this game, but I was a huge fan of Insane Aquarium and sponsored, so what the fuck are you talking about?
[07:02.86]Nobody paid me to play this fucking game.
[07:05.08]We talked about this game like two weeks ago.
[07:08.99]No, George Phan didn't pay me money to play this game.
[07:12.57]Get that out of your head immediately.
[07:17.65]Nobody paid me to play this game.
[07:21.25]Look,
[07:22.97]I woke up this morning and walked outside my house, and there were two giant briefcases full of $100 bills.
[07:32.72]Somebody just put them there.
[07:34.22]I didn't tell... They were just there, and I was like, oh, wow, cool, briefcases, money in them.
[07:41.38]What?
[07:42.40]Where the fuck did these come from?
[07:46.38]No, I'm serious.
[07:47.52]Hold on, shut up, music.
[07:49.29]I'm fucking kidding.
[07:50.61]It's not real.
[07:53.14]I've been looking forward to this game, let's play it.
[08:06.15]Sushi time.
[08:09.09]Wait a minute.
[08:18.59]Wait, this is what makes him destroy the world?
[08:24.46]Oh no, there's sushi.
[08:25.30]Now I'm going to destroy New York.
[08:27.04]Are you serious?
[08:29.86]What the fuck?
[08:31.90]What?
[08:32.64]Okay, destroy the Statue of Liberty.
[08:36.32]Okay.
[08:39.31]That was very abrupt, but let's go for it.
[08:44.53]So from my understanding, this game only has two buttons.
[08:48.53]Left and right click.
[08:49.35]Am I playing?
[08:49.87]No.
[08:51.47]Use left or right click to rotate.
[08:54.90]Okay.
[08:55.20]Oh, I gotta turn the music up.
[09:01.08]The music is like insane.
[09:02.20]The music's beautiful!
[09:04.76]So you just have to touch things.
[09:06.68]Coins.
[09:06.96]Do I have to click them?
[09:07.60]No.
[09:10.24]Yeah, America is under attack.
[09:12.61]By this thing.
[09:15.05]Wait, we gotta turn this up.
[09:17.69]Just a little bit, right?
[09:19.95]That's better.
[09:24.40]So the game gets insane, eventually.
[09:29.70]What song is this?
[09:34.22]It's Cloverfield.
[09:38.87]Go back to Insane Aquarium?
[09:40.15]No, this is, this is, no!
[09:41.41]Hey!
[09:42.25]Quiet down!
[09:43.09]Okay?
[09:43.55]Quiet!
[09:44.27]Stop shouting at me!
[09:47.47]We're doing the tutorial!
[09:52.32]A huge wave of enemies is approaching.
[09:53.87]This is by the guy that made Plants vs. Zombies.
[09:55.89]This is the Plants vs. Zombies spiritual sequel.
[09:59.39]Calm down.
[10:00.05]Don't shout at me.
[10:11.68]Very, very, very simple.
[10:12.66]Somebody gave $100.
[10:13.18]Oh, shit.
[10:13.42]Hold on.
[10:20.56]Alright, I took damage.
[10:21.72]I actually took damage, and I unlocked something.
[10:25.60]You got some new DNA.
[10:26.73]Crab DNA.
[10:27.61]Deals big, up-close damage.
[10:33.91]Okay.
[10:35.89]Add a tentacle.
[10:36.59]Here you go.
[10:37.13]So, oh, this game is fucking so stupid.
[10:39.37]This game's so easy.
[10:40.63]Oh, yeah, didn't think we could add tentacles, did you?
[10:45.92]Okay, snake shoots venom.
[10:48.18]Crab deals up close to... Okay, well, I didn't... Uh, okay.
[10:53.50]Let's... I'm gonna do crab.
[10:56.08]Put crab here.
[10:58.84]Snake?
[10:59.20]No.
[10:59.58]We have enough of snake?
[11:00.24]We do.
[11:01.98]Uh, shoots venom.
[11:02.78]Let's put this on the opposite side.
[11:06.10]Alright.
[11:09.58]Why the fuck does this octopus start with only two tentacles?
[11:13.28]That's a good question.
[11:15.15]But, uh, Asha, Asha108 just gave $100.
[11:19.21]Hey Jeremy, this is George Swift.
[11:24.29]Here's part one of your payment for playing our game.
[11:27.04]Make sure to hide this from your viewers, or else they'll think you're a sellout streamer.
[11:30.52]Part two comes after you deliver the scripted statement.
[11:33.18]Thanks.
[11:37.32]Thank you, Asher, for the 100 bucks.
[11:39.60]Nobody paid me to play this game.
[11:41.84]This is a fucking... This is gonna be a classic.
[11:44.12]This is gonna be an instant classic.
[11:45.78]Just trust me.
[11:47.76]Do you guys trust me?
[11:49.80]If I was standing behind you and we were in gym class and somebody pushed you into me with your eyes closed and your hands crossed, I'm gonna catch you, right?
[11:58.28]Because the answer is no.
[12:00.24]I'm gonna let you fall and then the whole class is gonna laugh at you.
[12:03.78]So... You gotta trust me on this one.
[12:08.16]But thank you, Asha, for the $100.
[12:09.38]Appreciate that.
[12:11.48]Billy Uppercut, thanks for the $10.
[12:12.92]Sponsored stream.
[12:14.50]You can think that if you want, but it's not.
[12:17.18]Destroy.
[12:17.46]We're going to get the Statue of Liberty.
[12:21.68]I'm too short to hold you up.
[12:23.66]Well, that's fine.
[12:24.32]You can think that.
[12:25.65]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[12:26.91]New mechanics here.
[12:29.95]Oh, my God.
[12:30.43]Okay, that's a one-hit.
[12:31.43]That's a one-hit.
[12:34.09]Oh, my God.
[12:34.65]I wasn't even paying attention.
[12:40.33]Okay.
[12:40.73]Hold on.
[12:41.61]We're getting real different here.
[12:43.85]Just wait a minute.
[12:44.45]I have one life left.
[12:46.79]Oh shit.
[12:47.65]Okay.
[12:48.39]I wasn't even looking at the other side of the screen.
[12:55.11]Frab claw.
[12:56.03]Alright.
[12:56.29]Nice.
[13:00.12]Okay.
[13:00.86]I'm starting to understand this now.
[13:03.30]How did I let that happen?
[13:05.38]This is cool.
[13:10.11]I thought the shot was going to go a little bit further, but that's a big thing coming here.
[13:16.50]What the fuck?
[13:19.50]Do it!
[13:20.04]Oh my god.
[13:20.52]Okay, so it's timed.
[13:23.38]Once every second.
[13:27.66]Oh man.
[13:28.04]Wait, there's a treasure chest right there.
[13:29.18]Do I have to shoot it?
[13:31.82]Yeah.
[13:40.86]Alright, this is a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be.
[13:45.48]I missed the fucking treasure chest.
[13:47.36]And a huge wave is coming.
[13:48.46]I'm gonna lose on like the first level.
[13:52.93]I think this combination might not be that great.
[13:58.37]Extra health?
[13:59.39]Cool.
[14:05.10]Oh shit!
[14:06.76]Oh shit!
[14:08.46]Oh my god!
[14:09.62]I'm gonna lose!
[14:12.61]Get it!
[14:13.21]Get it!
[14:14.53]Woo!
[14:16.43]Shells.
[14:19.53]Alright.
[14:22.23]Save up shells to buy cool stuff.
[14:28.90]Okay.
[14:29.56]Going good.
[14:30.32]Going okay.
[14:31.38]I want another tentacle for sure.
[14:34.70]I'm not sure if I like the... I think I want another snake.
[14:40.41]Do I want a snake or do I want a...
[14:45.44]Okay, this is currently sold out.
[14:46.64]I got two snakes.
[14:48.32]Forget about the claw.
[14:49.12]I don't like the claw.
[14:49.66]It's too slow.
[14:50.14]I'm doing double snake.
[14:56.99]Oh, what a shell out.
[15:00.89]This is interesting so far, though.
[15:01.97]I'm going to have eight tentacles with a bunch of shit all over them.
[15:07.79]Treasure chest.
[15:08.31]Hold on.
[15:18.79]I can't... The snakes.
[15:21.57]Okay, maybe I shouldn't use the snakes.
[15:23.03]Maybe I'll put the snakes away for now.
[15:27.79]God damn it.
[15:29.13]I'm gonna lose.
[15:30.95]Alright, no no no.
[15:32.71]I think I've already blown it.
[15:33.75]I think I blew it already.
[15:39.90]Two crab claws?
[15:46.56]I think I... Alright, let me just focus.
[15:50.16]All snakes, I can't do all snakes right now.
[15:51.96]Alright, that's better.
[15:58.56]Now when that chest gets over here, finally.
[16:00.24]Hit it.
[16:07.67]Three, four.
[16:08.73]Alright, that's fine.
[16:13.35]Eventually I think I can upgrade the snakes.
[16:15.03]Maybe I can.
[16:18.28]I want to get that chest.
[16:19.88]There's two chests.
[16:20.66]Oh my god.
[16:21.24]There's three chests.
[16:22.00]I don't know what to do.
[16:23.54]I'm freaking out.
[16:30.76]There's too many things on the screen.
[16:34.80]Hit it!
[16:35.49]Oh my god.
[16:39.15]Jesus Christ.
[16:42.84]Alright, this is way more intricate than I... Oh, fuck.
[16:46.88]We got a boss?
[16:48.28]Yeah, it's a boss.
[16:53.54]Alright, it's that easy.
[16:54.60]Just gotta keep it moving around.
[16:55.60]Just take one hit with the snakes.
[17:04.36]Just keep them lined up.
[17:05.77]There we go.
[17:11.34]Alright, the snake's actually turned out to be a decent play here.
[17:14.67]Otherwise, I would not have been able to even hurt this guy.
[17:19.87]What the fuck?
[17:20.49]Are you serious?
[17:21.31]Oh, god damn it.
[17:22.13]Don't blow this.
[17:22.69]Alright, just focus on the little guys.
[17:35.26]Focus on the old fish game.
[17:37.98]Remember that thing?
[17:38.86]That plastic toy?
[17:41.06]Where you pick the fucking fish up?
[17:42.52]Can I get him with this?
[17:43.48]Yep, okay, I can.
[17:46.02]Got it.
[17:47.68]I didn't blow it, I'm fine.
[17:52.60]We got a new piece of DNA.
[17:55.37]Penguin DNA.
[17:56.21]Freezes enemies.
[18:01.49]Demon destroyed.
[18:02.29]Oh boy.
[18:04.51]Alright, what the hell does he do?
[18:05.71]Freeze his enemies?
[18:09.50]Add a tentacle.
[18:16.38]I just don't even know what to do here.
[18:18.00]Did I do two crabs?
[18:21.56]Let's try this.
[18:23.74]All penguin.
[18:24.36]I can only do one penguin right now.
[18:28.94]Two snakes, two crabs, and a penguin.
[18:34.99]I only have one more.
[18:36.29]I don't have any more continues.
[18:41.72]This game's currently on Steam, by the way.
[18:43.74]Alright, now I'm out of the water.
[18:47.62]Alright, the game just became a different game here.
[18:53.27]So I have to roll this way.
[18:57.85]And they just shoot automatically here.
[19:03.71]Okay.
[19:05.43]Alright, they got like nuclear bombs that are dropping on me here.
[19:09.84]Get it, get the building.
[19:11.16]Destroy it!
[19:16.31]Alright, I get the strategy here.
[19:18.19]Gotta freeze those... Stay right here.
[19:22.15]Oh shit, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[19:24.73]Just keep moving.
[19:27.31]Gotta get rid of this... Oh my god, this is too much for my brain to handle.
[19:32.85]It's too much!
[19:35.41]I don't know what to do, I don't know what direction I need to go.
[19:37.37]Freeze him!
[19:39.18]There we go, now I got two guys on the left that are gonna be unfrozen.
[19:44.04]I'm gonna keep moving a little bit here.
[19:45.48]No, that was a bad idea.
[19:46.38]Okay, there's no time limit, right?
[19:55.40]I don't think there's a time limit, that's good.
[19:57.26]Wow!
[20:02.06]The penguin does not do damage, the penguin only freezes.
[20:06.19]Very good, though.
[20:09.65]That's health, nice.
[20:10.91]Let's keep moving.
[20:15.87]Another building to destroy.
[20:17.01]Oh lord, get it, come on.
[20:25.88]Both snakes attacking at the same time, probably a good idea.
[20:28.36]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, roll through, come on.
[20:37.50]A huge wave.
[20:41.52]By huge wave, what do they mean by, okay, I need to be, I need to focus here, I don't have any more lives.
[20:46.24]That's a nuke, that's a nuke, don't go, I don't want to touch the nuke.
[20:50.02]DNA building, okay, I gotta be fucking careful here, because this is not gonna be good news.
[20:53.40]That's how you combo.
[20:59.02]Let's go.
[21:06.26]Get the building!
[21:10.14]Huge wow.
[21:14.41]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[21:18.97]Here comes the nuke.
[21:21.89]Got it.
[21:23.59]Nice.
[21:24.73]What is this?
[21:26.70]You got some new lobster DNA.
[21:28.30]Deals bigger up close damage.
[21:35.12]Oh, I see what this does now.
[21:38.90]Okay.
[21:42.93]So you unlock a bunch of shit and then eventually it rolls like a hearthstone deck.
[21:52.45]I think I'm going to keep this.
[21:53.25]I don't think I'm going to change anything.
[21:57.00]I don't even have enough money to do this.
[22:02.44]Sell the crabs for the lobster.
[22:03.68]I don't think you can sell.
[22:04.60]I think it has to stay there.
[22:06.40]Yeah, we're going to stick with this.
[22:14.80]Yeah, we're gonna do that.
[22:16.10]Two more to the Statue of Liberty.
[22:20.62]No, I don't think I want to do another penguin.
[22:22.62]Because another penguin... Penguins don't do damage.
[22:25.91]This setup has worked pretty well last time.
[22:27.81]Wait, we got a chest.
[22:28.65]Multiple chests.
[22:30.19]Freeze them.
[22:30.53]Freeze them all.
[22:31.03]Freeze all... Wait, this is a fucking nuke.
[22:33.13]No, no, no.
[22:33.49]Wait, wait, wait.
[22:33.85]I know what to do.
[22:35.33]Just keep freezing these, and then when the nuke gets over here, they can all blow up at the same time.
[22:39.98]Ready?
[22:40.16]Ready?
[22:43.77]Free?
[22:45.03]Come on.
[22:46.49]It's not gonna work, is it?
[22:48.73]I think it is.
[22:51.77]Oh shit.
[22:55.88]Oh my god, what have I done?
[22:59.52]Just blow it up!
[23:00.94]Oh god damn it!
[23:02.18]It's too much!
[23:04.74]I wanna restart the level.
[23:06.12]Restart, no I can't.
[23:07.04]God damn it.
[23:09.75]I just like realized what was happening like fucking halfway through there.
[23:12.31]God.
[23:17.50]I don't have any more lives.
[23:19.36]I need to move.
[23:28.15]There is no saves coming in this game because I have to go to the beginning if I lose again.
[23:35.95]Mensa certified streamer.
[23:37.29]I didn't know that was gonna happen.
[23:38.43]I didn't play this level yet.
[23:44.78]It's kind of like Rampage.
[23:45.68]It does remind me of Rampage.
[23:46.74]Is this going to hurt me?
[23:48.16]No.
[23:49.28]That was a concern I had.
[23:50.29]I need to roll the snakes over here.
[23:59.99]Just pinch my way to victory.
[24:04.38]Those can stay.
[24:04.96]That's fine.
[24:05.38]I'm just going to load up this way, have both snakes shoot, and then I'll get a double claw here.
[24:12.10]One, two, three.
[24:12.92]Nope.
[24:16.40]I'm just murdering people in these buildings, by the way.
[24:24.47]Go, go, go, go, go!
[24:27.65]Here comes a huge wave in New York City, almost at the Statue of Liberty.
[24:30.69]It's gonna be a boss.
[24:35.78]Yeah, if you're just trickling in, by the way, this is by the guy that made Plants vs. Zombies, the original one.
[24:41.34]Not the one that tried to take all your money.
[24:44.89]He's also the guy that made Insane Aquarium.
[24:47.91]So this game, this is no joke.
[24:52.46]There's a shell building.
[24:57.22]This is not a sponsor, I'm not even gonna say it again, okay?
[25:05.36]Oh, come on, give me a combo here.
[25:06.84]Big combo, big combo with the bomb, come on!
[25:13.44]And look at those people die!
[25:15.96]What a fun game!
[25:17.12]There it is.
[25:29.95]Save up shells to buy cool stuff.
[25:32.53]We are... Alright, I think I'm... What should I replace here?
[25:37.83]Because Lobsterclaw is very high damage, and it's rare.
[25:43.74]It's 500 bucks, though.
[25:49.09]What, should I replace one of these?
[25:50.21]Should I take away one of the snakes?
[25:54.83]Get rid of one of the lobster claws?
[25:57.29]More penguins.
[25:59.49]What if I do all penguins and the super lobster?
[26:09.49]So we gotta replace...
[26:12.37]Does it attack slower?
[26:13.31]That's a good question.
[26:18.73]I do like the freeze ability, though.
[26:21.67]More penguins?
[26:24.61]Save?
[26:25.45]I can't save.
[26:26.05]I'm going to keep it like this.
[26:32.13]I don't have enough money.
[26:35.07]That's the worst idea I've ever had.
[26:36.71]What?
[26:40.31]I'm going to try this.
[26:42.79]Oh, you know what?
[26:45.69]I did it.
[26:46.58]I shouldn't have done that, but I did it anyways.
[26:50.24]We're at the Statue of Liberty.
[26:51.16]Alright, I don't have any more lives left.
[26:58.08]Look, it's all going to be made up for.
[26:59.20]I have a gigantic crab claw.
[27:04.60]Here we go.
[27:05.02]Freeze it.
[27:10.67]How does it... Same exact attack speed.
[27:14.25]Is it gonna reach the... Come on, reach it!
[27:15.93]Reach it!
[27:16.83]Oh, shit!
[27:19.87]Freeze it!
[27:20.15]Freeze it!
[27:20.91]Freeze him!
[27:22.25]I'll get it here.
[27:23.05]I'm gonna get my first chest.
[27:28.34]It don't... It's not a big deal.
[27:29.98]Still cool, though.
[27:34.48]Get double nukes on the side there.
[27:37.94]Oh boy, oh boy.
[27:41.29]Oh, come on, you fucked it up.
[27:46.15]I think this actually was a great idea.
[27:48.39]The penguins are really good.
[27:49.53]I just want all penguins only.
[27:52.64]A lot of things coming on the other side.
[28:01.96]Too many things.
[28:06.06]Get it!
[28:07.08]Get it before it's too late!
[28:10.71]Blow up the bomb!
[28:13.90]What's happening?
[28:14.60]Oh, okay.
[28:18.56]I'm scared of these.
[28:20.54]What if they get too close?
[28:24.64]I don't even know if those can hurt you.
[28:26.30]But I'm not going to take the chance with no lives.
[28:27.91]Alright, here we go.
[28:29.23]Huge enemy.
[28:29.79]The butcher is approaching.
[28:30.77]The butcher.
[28:33.67]Oh, dear lord.
[28:37.79]Just like... Okay.
[28:39.03]Okay.
[28:41.02]It's just like Contra.
[28:43.42]Can I freeze him?
[28:44.00]I can.
[28:45.43]So don't get close.
[28:46.53]Watch out for the thing, he throws knives in the air.
[28:52.99]It actually does telegraph on the ground.
[28:54.43]Alright, hold on.
[28:58.72]Just gotta freeze him and get close.
[29:03.70]This is too small.
[29:04.60]It's not long enough.
[29:09.18]I gotta get a good roll here, and then come around.
[29:17.12]My arms are too short.
[29:21.49]We're just gonna have to snake this up a little bit here.
[29:27.63]I can get it now.
[29:28.15]It's the same deal.
[29:31.45]I should get it right here.
[29:33.21]Get it!
[29:34.21]Come on, one more!
[29:35.43]Yes, the greed is real!
[29:41.06]That thing does do a shitload of damage.
[29:45.70]Oh, fuck!
[29:46.10]I don't want to lose here.
[29:54.16]Snakes is pretty shitty, but, you know, if I didn't have them I would be doing zero damage.
[30:04.07]Nope, not long enough.
[30:07.22]I get to get that one opportunity where I can get in really, really close and just use the claw.
[30:10.30]It does so much damage.
[30:12.36]Right here.
[30:14.61]Get it again.
[30:14.99]Nice.
[30:18.15]I could probably get... You know, if I wanted to be greedy, I could get another one.
[30:20.33]Alright, now we're getting a lot... Oh!
[30:27.84]Okay.
[30:29.66]We can just watch the things in the air.
[30:34.64]Oh, shit.
[30:35.46]Oh my god, I just walked right into that.
[30:36.74]Don't die here.
[30:38.84]Oh, shit.
[30:39.74]Calm down.
[30:40.14]Jeremy, calm down.
[30:54.55]Where they going?
[30:54.91]Where they going?
[30:55.29]Oh my god, is that gonna hit me?
[30:59.24]Oh my god.
[31:06.45]Oh shit!
[31:08.64]Damn it, I'm dead!
[31:10.12]Oh, so there's permanent upgrades.
[31:35.41]Shoots venom faster.
[31:37.13]Porcupine.
[31:37.97]Snail.
[31:38.87]Blocks one hit.
[31:39.85]Alright.
[31:40.81]You're supposed to die.
[31:42.19]Okay.
[31:44.61]I know I look too young to be a grandma.
[31:48.36]Cobra DNA.
[31:54.76]Special offer.
[31:55.30]Buy one more thing for next heart.
[31:59.64]Blocks one hit.
[32:03.62]Thank you.
[32:04.74]Here, let me give you a heart.
[32:05.92]Alright, okay.
[32:08.03]You're supposed to die.
[32:09.01]You're supposed to level up.
[32:10.71]You're supposed to do permanent... It's kind of like Rogue Legacy.
[32:13.63]Except there's an octopus.
[32:14.71]You destroy Earth.
[32:16.03]And it was made by the Plants vs. Zombies guy.
[32:19.61]This is fucking cool.
[32:20.82]This is cool.
[32:21.42]I like this.
[32:22.38]Go again.
[32:25.04]And then it rolls what they attack with.
[32:27.28]I just got a bunch of question marks.
[32:28.86]Alright, this is cool.
[32:30.00]Let's do it.
[32:30.62]Let's get it.
[32:35.12]Now I know the basic mechanics.
[32:36.82]Look, the problem last time... I died at the tutorial level last time because I had no idea what the hell was going on.
[32:50.62]I'm not going to waste my lives this time.
[32:52.10]We were just trying to figure out how to play the game before.
[32:54.01]I'm not going to get unnecessarily hit in the first level now.
[33:03.55]What's coming in first?
[33:09.27]And we're going to get chests too.
[33:10.45]I'm not going to miss the chest.
[33:12.63]You know the word I'm saying.
[33:14.23]I've said it as a joke so many times that I can't even say it.
[33:17.86]What happened there?
[33:19.22]What happened to stop getting unnecessarily hit by things?
[33:23.22]Were we not just listening to what we were just saying?
[33:26.02]Ah, I'm in the ocean.
[33:39.32]I've said it wrong.
[33:41.02]Okay, I get it.
[33:41.62]They just have to get the tip on there.
[33:47.12]I need that.
[33:47.70]Give it to me.
[33:49.88]Alright, it's like it never even happened, guys.
[33:51.16]Don't worry.
[33:59.93]And some shells.
[34:02.25]Come on, shoot.
[34:04.01]And a gold coin.
[34:08.68]Five shells.
[34:09.58]Keep going.
[34:10.92]Alright.
[34:13.43]Unlock extra slot in shell shop.
[34:17.69]Extra life.
[34:19.51]This is like... You're talking about min-maxing here.
[34:23.59]I think we need to... We need to add a tentacle.
[34:27.99]Let's get a snake on here.
[34:31.91]What about... What about just another tentacle and forget about the snake?
[34:35.31]I don't want really either of these two things.
[34:42.42]Penguin and two tentacles?
[34:45.48]I like that idea.
[34:49.14]Penguin with two tentacles.
[34:50.38]Let's try this one out.
[34:57.21]Just only tentacle run.
[34:58.61]I'm not prepared for that yet.
[35:00.01]You think I'm good enough at this game to be able to do that?
[35:04.23]Why is it shooting so fast?
[35:08.75]This is kind of freaking me out.
[35:09.55]Why am I shooting this so fast?
[35:14.60]Did this get upgraded too?
[35:15.54]Or does this only do this in the water?
[35:25.27]That was fucking close.
[35:26.11]Okay, that worked out for us somehow.
[35:45.08]Will you please?
[35:45.94]God damn it.
[35:50.52]I gotta be careful though, because the slower they move, that actually might be bad for me.
[35:53.69]Because then it's hard to actually line everything up.
[36:04.25]See what I'm saying?
[36:04.83]Like, more can come in now, and I'm not going to be prepared for it when it actually happens.
[36:08.77]So I have to slow it down a little bit.
[36:15.73]Here comes a huge wave.
[36:16.73]Here we go.
[36:17.17]I'm gonna get hit here.
[36:18.37]Don't say that.
[36:23.43]One tap for the little ones.
[36:32.22]There you go.
[36:38.96]Big guy.
[36:43.16]Alright, come on, get it.
[36:44.58]Get it, come on.
[36:46.02]There it is.
[36:46.50]11 shells, nice.
[36:56.45]What do we got?
[36:59.55]Mmm.
[37:01.49]Are we outside yet?
[37:06.38]I wonder if it's not, yeah, because we're going to get started in planes and shit, right?
[37:10.70]Hmm.
[37:14.29]Let's get a tentacle on here.
[37:19.38]And maybe get a crab on here too.
[37:25.16]Yeah.
[37:26.02]We'll do a crab on the other side here.
[37:27.94]I don't like it.
[37:33.20]Yeah, okay, we're still in the water.
[37:57.40]Get it.
[37:57.62]Ooh, come on.
[38:00.96]Get it.
[38:01.73]Nice.
[38:02.49]Yeah.
[38:04.37]Oh, that one made me all tingly.
[38:11.55]Oh, careful here.
[38:20.86]Get that one.
[38:21.30]Come on.
[38:22.44]Oh, you're missing it.
[38:23.28]You're missing it, Jeremy.
[38:27.07]Awww!
[38:27.33]It does actually hurt you.
[38:28.62]Oh shit, wait, no this is the... Can I?
[38:33.86]I don't think I can hurt this thing right now.
[38:38.22]No, I can.
[38:45.71]This would be much easier with a snake though.
[38:50.68]You can move it around and hit multiple enemies with that swing.
[38:53.22]Alright, I figured out something about the crab.
[38:55.65]That actually is great.
[38:59.13]A swing can hurt.
[39:00.83]It's not just one pinpointed pinch.
[39:03.67]You can drag it across and hit a couple of things.
[39:06.49]Just in the same few frames that it happens.
[39:08.13]See you later.
[39:18.14]Got it.
[39:21.47]One pinpoint pinch.
[39:28.37]More shells.
[39:30.11]What do we got?
[39:32.17]Ooh, okay.
[39:32.87]I don't know if that's worth it, though.
[39:40.32]Extra life is 350.
[39:44.62]Snail.
[39:45.08]That's a lot of money for just an extra health point.
[39:49.81]But wait, is it...
[39:53.31]Is it just... Do I... Let's put it over here.
[40:03.93]I think I like that.
[40:13.16]For now.
[40:13.46]That's all I can do.
[40:18.90]The dual penguins here.
[40:25.85]No snakes.
[40:26.55]No, we don't need the snakes.
[40:30.67]At least I don't think you do.
[40:33.40]Not now.
[40:34.26]I can always replace them.
[40:36.34]But the idea here is I can just go like this and have two penguins that are blocking everything.
[40:43.02]Yeah!
[40:43.82]What?
[40:44.61]Come on now.
[40:45.49]That didn't swing?
[40:47.87]I'm mildly irritated by that.
[40:59.77]Damn it.
[41:00.31]That was free hard.
[41:06.88]Tap, tap.
[41:08.04]Alright, here comes another chest.
[41:09.04]I gotta get this one.
[41:16.28]Grab it.
[41:17.44]Get it again.
[41:18.49]Get it again.
[41:20.03]Thank you.
[41:26.43]You take a lot of damage.
[41:27.47]Ooh, back it up.
[41:32.72]On to... I just heard... Okay, there it is.
[41:34.24]Don't fuck this one up.
[41:35.52]Get it.
[41:37.32]Get it.
[41:38.24]Thank you.
[41:38.98]God, I was going to be so angry if I did not get that.
[41:41.41]Oh, shit.
[41:47.65]I'm putting myself in a bad place.
[41:49.27]Bad place.
[41:52.65]Oh, shit.
[41:53.91]Oh, just freeze everybody.
[41:56.69]Show them why Sub-Zero is the shittiest character.
[41:59.61]To go against an online mode.
[42:01.63]Not even funny.
[42:02.91]Not funny at all.
[42:03.99]Stop it.
[42:04.67]Play the game.
[42:10.88]Not even fucking funny.
[42:12.50]Not even close to being remotely humorous.
[42:21.76]Like the fucking Wiggles make better jokes than I just did.
[42:26.09]Oh my god, now I'm angry.
[42:27.23]I'm angry at how bad that was.
[42:29.57]I'm actually on tilt because of how un-fucking-funny that joke was.
[42:41.83]Alright, let's clear this before I get in any more trouble.
[42:53.54]Not happening to me again.
[42:56.62]There we go.
[42:57.24]Shell it.
[42:57.74]Come on.
[43:04.06]Hit it!
[43:05.16]Break it, please!
[43:06.78]I don't want to lose any lives before the boss.
[43:09.04]It's very important.
[43:11.90]There it is.
[43:12.28]Okay, cool.
[43:18.40]Sits on my one good weapon and shoots zero damage.
[43:21.03]I'm just trying to clear the level.
[43:22.53]Look, I got tilted by that awful thing I said.
[43:24.55]Alright, hold on.
[43:27.85]I wonder if I should just buy this.
[43:31.19]Oh, should we do two snakes here on opposite sides?
[43:33.01]No, I don't like that.
[43:36.37]The snail doesn't want to go away.
[43:42.29]Another penguin.
[43:44.75]More penguins.
[43:48.15]I kind of want to see what this looks like.
[43:57.59]The lives are getting more expensive.
[43:58.91]Yeah, they are.
[43:59.27]And I'm going to put a snake on.
[44:09.18]I kind of want to see what this does, though.
[44:11.30]But is it a tentacle or is it just a straight-up upgrade to my health pool?
[44:29.13]I need to see what it did.
[44:30.37]Alright, so what does it do?
[44:31.81]Just blocks one hit and that comes off?
[44:37.12]That's $300.
[44:46.39]Alright, well, I wonder if that recharges.
[44:53.57]Let's hope so.
[45:02.79]Come on, touch it, touch it!
[45:07.55]Smash it!
[45:08.49]There we go.
[45:12.52]I'm not sure that's worth 300 bucks.
[45:23.03]Oh, no.
[45:25.59]Oh, no.
[45:26.53]Oh, no.
[45:27.53]Oh, no.
[45:28.91]Oh, no.
[45:30.19]Well, it's gone already, because I couldn't fucking... The two penguins is a bad idea.
[45:37.52]The two penguins is not working out so well, because I can't hit anything on that side of my whole body.
[45:42.98]So, this is not going to go well.
[45:47.44]I have a passive entire side of my entire octopus.
[46:01.46]Should have got a couple of snakes.
[46:04.18]And you guys wanted me to add... You wanted me to put another penguin on here?
[46:07.05]You know how much... Do you see how much of a disaster that would be?
[46:13.53]Like, see what I'm saying?
[46:14.19]Like, I'm fucked.
[46:15.27]I can't do anything.
[46:17.43]Get it.
[46:18.17]I have to shoot this.
[46:19.61]This has to explode right now.
[46:22.77]Take it all out.
[46:23.85]Thank God.
[46:24.95]I just got so lucky.
[46:25.87]Alright.
[46:32.95]Bad placement.
[46:35.67]I can't do anything.
[46:40.29]We have to roll back until I can shoot these things down.
[46:46.48]Shoot the planes down.
[46:47.34]Look at the dumb looks on their faces.
[46:56.44]There we go.
[47:05.85]Oh god!
[47:09.29]It's so stressful.
[47:10.37]Alright, get rid of this building, please!
[47:16.98]Is this PopCap?
[47:17.94]This is made by the guy that made all of your favorite PopCap games.
[47:26.50]This is not made by PopCap.
[47:30.18]It is made by Mr. PopCap himself, George Fant.
[47:36.66]Oh shit, get rid of this quickly before anything happens.
[47:41.79]Please.
[47:45.63]There it is.
[47:49.23]One swing here, get rid of them all.
[47:50.57]Come on.
[47:51.01]No, no, no, no, no.
[47:52.05]There we go.
[47:52.43]Thank you.
[47:55.97]Around the corner.
[47:58.17]Does that alert the horde or something?
[48:00.15]See, I need something right there.
[48:01.65]This tentacle is the worst place.
[48:04.41]You need to freeze and then you need to... I get it.
[48:10.64]It's all about the placement.
[48:16.22]Swing!
[48:16.50]Oh my god, what the fuck are you doing?
[48:22.93]Keep rolling.
[48:23.57]We're at the last building here.
[48:24.81]Good.
[48:25.21]Get rid of it.
[48:30.85]Just sit here.
[48:31.39]It'll go down eventually.
[48:34.80]This town doesn't have very many people in it.
[48:37.39]Yeah, Doug.
[48:39.27]Oh boy.
[48:41.69]This building's gotta go down now!
[48:46.69]Okay, I've gotten a little too greedy there.
[48:49.02]A little too greedy, but that's fine.
[48:51.06]Everything's gonna be alright.
[48:51.92]I'm gonna hick him the nukes.
[49:00.10]If you take too long, the nukes come from the other side.
[49:02.53]I understand.
[49:09.08]Get it?
[49:10.28]Yes!
[49:10.86]Okay.
[49:11.40]We're safe.
[49:11.76]We still have all of our lives.
[49:18.57]Way more shells than we had before.
[49:22.89]Okay.
[49:24.23]Alright.
[49:25.03]Wait a minute here.
[49:25.69]Hold on.
[49:27.67]So, this is the boss.
[49:29.29]It's the guy with the eye.
[49:31.66]I'm gonna say I don't wanna do Lobster here.
[49:33.58]I think I'm gonna do Cobra.
[49:37.81]Because getting in close is really, really annoying.
[49:44.50]I only have enough of one of these.
[49:45.40]I think I'm going to do Cobra.
[49:47.46]No, I'm not putting the Penguin on.
[49:48.74]Getting rid of one of the Penguins.
[49:58.56]I was thinking, like, Cobra here.
[50:01.66]So in case I'm missing anything, you know, I got a double shot here.
[50:06.77]Well, it's done.
[50:07.35]So we're doing double cobra.
[50:08.69]I got a penguin.
[50:09.19]Look, I think this is going to be fine.
[50:10.67]I'm not adding a penguin.
[50:15.99]You cannot move anything, by the way.
[50:18.98]All you can do is replace.
[50:20.06]There's no selling.
[50:20.86]There's no moving.
[50:22.14]You can only replace.
[50:27.46]What do you mean, what the fuck?
[50:28.82]What are you talking about?
[50:34.14]Add penguin or riot.
[50:35.32]No, I'm saving that money.
[50:39.24]Why did I just do that?
[50:40.08]There was no reason to fucking do that.
[50:41.41]There was absolutely no reason for that.
[50:43.81]That's gonna be the reason why I lose.
[50:45.25]I'm ready.
[50:52.45]Yeah, but the tentacle at least does damage.
[50:59.31]Oh boy, forget about everything I just said.
[51:02.82]I just found, like, the best addition to the whole game.
[51:05.06]This thing is incredible.
[51:07.94]It shoots rapid fire.
[51:09.90]Oh!
[51:11.10]It's great.
[51:11.86]Okay, we're gonna be fine.
[51:12.84]Never mind.
[51:13.24]I got the good roll.
[51:24.67]Can I do it in one go?
[51:25.71]One go, come on.
[51:33.17]Fucking diarrhea inside my fucking mouth.
[51:35.80]Why am I so greedy?
[51:37.90]It never works.
[51:42.54]I've played plenty of Dark Souls to know that greed doesn't work.
[51:46.60]Ever.
[51:53.49]Here we go.
[51:54.53]I got two hearts.
[51:57.51]Just gonna play this smart.
[51:59.73]How far does it go?
[52:02.30]Pretty much just as far as the other one.
[52:08.54]Bang.
[52:10.10]Perfect.
[52:12.30]Watch out for the knives that fall from the top.
[52:14.10]They have the telegraph.
[52:16.60]And do it again.
[52:18.28]Right inside of his face.
[52:22.21]He won't hit me with that either.
[52:23.75]That was very close, actually.
[52:25.23]That was too close.
[52:26.35]Can I hit him with that?
[52:30.73]I don't think so.
[52:35.38]Yeah, look at these two useful penguins I have here.
[52:42.08]Watch out for this.
[52:44.66]It's actually hard to gauge how far ahead that thing can go.
[52:47.76]Alright, here comes the next phase.
[52:54.59]This is where it gets hairy.
[53:02.91]Mm-hmm.
[53:05.17]Just stand right in the middle.
[53:06.27]Okay, I didn't know what it was like.
[53:08.57]It's okay, we're good.
[53:09.27]You don't know what it's like!
[53:12.67]You don't know what it's like!
[53:15.77]Easy.
[53:19.22]Can't go that far.
[53:25.26]Once they start throwing in all this bullshit is where it gets hard.
[53:30.32]Four, five, six, seven.
[53:31.66]Where are they going?
[53:32.40]Right there, okay.
[53:35.10]What is the song in the background here?
[53:44.06]That's Frogs from Chrono Trigger's theme song.
[53:50.31]That's the rock version of Frogs theme.
[53:51.99]This is where I gotta be careful.
[53:57.07]Just play it safe.
[53:57.83]I'm just gonna watch where they go.
[54:00.73]There they are.
[54:06.09]Alright, I got a good enough opportunity here.
[54:09.33]No, I don't.
[54:14.65]Alright, again, again, just play it safe.
[54:19.54]Again, again, please play it safe.
[54:29.64]Show up with the knives.
[54:31.66]Safe.
[54:32.63]Come on, hit it.
[54:35.26]And let's finish this motherfucker right now.
[54:41.11]Not quite.
[54:41.97]Almost.
[54:48.95]Ooh, we're tight.
[54:51.28]Swing, please.
[54:56.06]Stay here.
[54:59.06]The penguins are not carrying.
[55:03.44]Don't say that.
[55:04.36]Penguins are doing an okay job.
[55:06.98]Slightly okay.
[55:12.16]I'm going to get in here and finish it right after this.
[55:15.28]Let's do it.
[55:16.64]Time to end it.
[55:18.04]Bingo.
[55:18.22]Got it.
[55:21.97]I hope that's the end.
[55:28.91]Perfect.
[55:32.69]That's not the end, by the way.
[55:37.88]Destroy the Statue of Liberty!
[55:43.44]Oh, they don't mess around, man.
[55:44.60]I actually have to keep fighting here.
[55:55.00]I'm just gonna use the big snake.
[55:56.88]That's the most reliable thing I have.
[56:03.00]Anti-American stream.
[56:09.42]Oh, look at this propaganda.
[56:10.80]That was close.
[56:20.58]We're good.
[56:23.62]All the attacks have tempo with the music.
[56:26.90]There it is.
[56:27.28]We got an egg.
[56:34.33]Egg.
[56:35.09]Just like an insane aquarium, you get an egg piece.
[56:40.63]You have found Spike the Pufferfish.
[56:43.36]Press both left and right to puff.
[56:49.34]Hmm.
[56:51.70]What is this?
[56:53.99]Left or right click to move.
[56:56.13]What's going on here?
[56:58.01]What do I have to do about this?
[57:01.63]Oh god.
[57:03.09]Is this like a little bonus game?
[57:06.50]Collect the shells?
[57:11.62]When does it recharge?
[57:15.50]Can I puff?
[57:15.88]Can I puff?
[57:16.30]Can I puff?
[57:16.96]Nope.
[57:18.56]Oh boy.
[57:19.10]Alright, this is... That's a long time.
[57:22.65]Oh boy.
[57:23.19]I gotta play this smart.
[57:34.46]This is a long bonus level.
[57:35.90]Shit!
[57:37.14]How was I supposed to know that was gonna happen?
[57:39.35]Ugh!
[57:45.67]Just follow the line.
[57:51.30]Oh my god!
[57:59.94]It's alright.
[58:01.14]Come on, this threw a whole new game at me here.
[58:05.99]Give me a break!
[58:12.85]Do I have to take a wild guess at where the next thing I have to go to is?
[58:19.55]Like, where's the next- what is that?
[58:21.07]Oh god.
[58:22.82]I'm dead.
[58:23.12]I'm gonna die.
[58:27.76]Oh my god, this is too much.
[58:30.28]Don't get hit by that!
[58:35.87]Holy Jesus Christ.
[58:39.45]Just stop talking for a minute.
[58:47.19]Did I win?
[58:47.62]Bee DNA!
[58:56.40]Shoots homing bees.
[59:02.20]Alright, I still can't go back.
[59:05.24]But, I mean, you're going to give me BDNA that I'm going to have to use.
[59:07.86]Puffer.
[59:09.32]Ah.
[59:11.82]That's cool.
[59:15.46]Mmm.
[59:15.56]I think we're going to have to do projectile here.
[59:23.36]Yeah.
[59:25.08]I'm going to get rid of one of the penguins.
[59:29.60]We'll go, like, here.
[59:35.43]No pufferfish.
[59:36.83]Remember, this is a roguelike.
[59:38.59]I can't go back and upgrade anything.
[59:41.23]I have to die.
[59:41.73]Here comes a new cutscene.
[59:56.00]Why me so dumb?
[59:57.54]Oh, and he shit his pants!
[60:06.09]He shit his pants out of his penis.
[60:07.47]That's so fucking funny.
[60:18.20]Larry, look.
[60:19.76]This guy just destroyed New York City.
[60:23.96]Who has time to do a play talking about it?
[60:26.74]Now you're gonna destroy the Sydney Opera House.
[60:30.67]None of those people had Australian accents.
[60:32.23]My immersion is ruined.
[60:36.71]That's me, in real life, responding to critics of my YouTube channel.
[60:42.13]Yeah, the only difference is I'm not coming to destroy your house.
[60:44.73]I think we're under water again.
[60:47.95]Yep.
[60:49.67]Let's see how this one works.
[60:52.41]How homing is it?
[60:53.87]It's pretty homing.
[60:54.79]New enemy type.
[60:55.45]See the bee?
[61:03.23]I like the bee because you don't even have to aim the bee.
[61:05.35]Perfect.
[61:06.84]That can just be doing its own thing while I use the other tentacles to attack.
[61:11.49]I like that!
[61:12.17]I still have two lives, by the way.
[61:21.55]Nice.
[61:31.01]Shocks.
[61:35.91]Works well on these enemies, too, because you just have to put it in their direction.
[61:39.25]They go in a circle.
[61:39.97]Freeze them up.
[61:49.57]Nice.
[61:50.29]I'm having fun.
[61:51.13]This is cool.
[61:55.86]Look, my final judgment of this game will be based around how many actual arms there are.
[62:00.34]You know what I mean?
[62:04.27]This is really fun.
[62:05.73]I love upgrades.
[62:06.59]I love games that require you to play and there's stakes.
[62:09.97]Don't lose!
[62:10.55]You have to start over.
[62:12.23]So if there are a bunch of different combinations and there are a ton of upgrades to do, then, you know, I'm going to go ahead and say this is a fucking great game.
[62:26.04]I kind of want all these.
[62:28.02]Is that weird for me to say that?
[62:36.57]New DNA.
[62:37.51]Chicken.
[62:40.20]He read that from the script.
[62:44.22]Let me open my sponsored script here.
[62:53.60]With over 25 different arms and 25 hours of fun.
[62:58.90]Check out our sale we have currently on Steam for 8% off.
[63:05.33]The game is about $12.
[63:07.52]What a steal.
[63:09.46]What a deal.
[63:13.80]Please read this with an emphasized voice.
[63:17.64]You're not going to find anything cooler than Octogeddon on Steam.
[63:23.35]Over eight arms.
[63:27.39]I can shoot eggs now.
[63:33.44]What a steal!
[63:35.24]Shoots exploding eggs.
[63:40.76]Eight arms, oh wow, I'm gonna get it today!
[63:48.32]We'll have to use it if it's new.
[63:50.26]Replace the, um, this idiot.
[63:56.52]No, let's replace the shitty snake with chicken arm.
[64:03.85]Okay.
[64:05.96]That looks good.
[64:07.60]I want to save up for another tentacle, though.
[64:13.12]Still in the water.
[64:15.03]This is going to be very loud and annoying, I can tell.
[64:17.11]Oh, wow.
[64:21.25]Well, this thing actually is really good.
[64:25.33]You can just lob them in any direction and they go across the whole screen.
[64:32.71]Remember I said I wanted all bees?
[64:35.03]Just kidding, I want all chickens.
[64:38.01]Oh shit, oh shit.
[64:39.99]Slow down here.
[64:48.20]Level design for the new arm.
[64:51.02]I'm still somehow fucking it up.
[64:58.81]Get the bees over there.
[65:02.32]This is an overwhelming dash of the video game.
[65:12.16]Can I get them all in one shot?
[65:13.70]No.
[65:20.31]I'm the ultimate gamer.
[65:22.67]Asha just gave another $50.
[65:23.63]I'll read the other bits later, by the way.
[65:26.77]I do have to focus and pay attention to this game, though.
[65:30.54]But thank you so much, Asha.
[65:32.85]You gave $100 earlier.
[65:33.35]So hold on, let me get to the end of this level and we'll see what it is you said.
[65:40.13]Can I skip?
[65:41.09]Wow, easy.
[65:46.52]You know, I'm finding it more and more fucking easier to do if you focus only on one or two of the tentacles and let the other two do work for you.
[65:53.88]Because it's way too overwhelming to try to pay attention to everything.
[65:56.79]So as long as you keep focused on half of your octopus, the other half will do the work for you.
[66:03.45]Uh, AshaGeorgeSwift again.
[66:05.17]Could've been better.
[66:07.79]So we're only gonna give you half of the previously agreed upon amount.
[66:10.42]Please do better in the future or else we'll have to find a new internet personality to shill the game for us.
[66:18.68]Well thank you, uh, MrSwift.
[66:23.17]Save, save.
[66:24.21]I ain't gonna spend any money right now.
[66:25.47]But there is another bee.
[66:27.40]I could do this.
[66:30.34]But I could do another bee and another chicken.
[66:32.20]I could replace Claw with a bee.
[66:34.30]And replace Penguin with a... I almost just said Snickers.
[66:41.63]It's a chicken, not a Snickers bar.
[66:45.19]Save, save.
[66:45.99]Alright, fine.
[66:46.63]I'll save.
[66:47.09]Fine.
[66:47.49]Fine.
[66:48.33]Fine.
[66:57.93]Oh, Snickers DNA!
[67:04.46]Sponsored.
[67:07.68]Get that little bastard before... Oh, no, no, no.
[67:09.70]Now they're actually adding the hard things.
[67:11.86]The things that are hard... Oh, wait.
[67:13.08]Calm down.
[67:13.80]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[67:18.26]Freeze.
[67:18.86]Freeze.
[67:19.92]Claw.
[67:21.15]Chicken.
[67:23.41]As long as I say the thing that I have to do, I'll do it.
[67:27.05]See, ready?
[67:27.45]Watch.
[67:30.33]Egg chest.
[67:32.93]Leading the targets.
[67:36.36]Got it!
[67:37.10]Yes!
[67:37.40]No!
[67:39.12]That's unfortunate.
[67:39.78]It's okay.
[67:45.94]I'm making plenty of money anyways.
[67:49.91]Freeze claw chicken.
[67:51.19]I didn't say it in the right order.
[67:54.05]A large enemy.
[67:54.75]Okay, we got another mini boss here.
[67:59.17]Megapede.
[68:02.27]What direction is he coming from?
[68:03.35]Over here.
[68:03.72]I think this is going to be a chicken shine.
[68:06.32]Where's he going?
[68:09.82]I don't know what's going on here.
[68:14.87]Freeze him.
[68:18.86]Oh, I gotta break him.
[68:19.96]I have to break his head before he hits me.
[68:24.16]I get it.
[68:25.00]Can I hit the other- can I hit the center?
[68:26.32]I can.
[68:26.74]No, that's not a good idea!
[68:27.84]Don't do that!
[68:28.40]Do not break the center!
[68:30.06]Don't break him!
[68:31.66]Oh, this is bad.
[68:34.40]You don't want to break him into these pieces.
[68:36.98]Holy shit.
[68:39.27]Oh, this is gonna be where we lose.
[68:40.69]Ow.
[68:44.67]Ow.
[68:44.79]Ow!
[68:54.81]Oh, not yet.
[68:55.95]Not yet.
[68:56.37]Not over yet.
[68:56.81]It's not over yet.
[69:04.27]It's not!
[69:06.43]It's over!
[69:09.76]Hello?
[69:10.14]Alright.
[69:14.92]I can get a new tentacle, though.
[69:30.99]The snail does recharge after every life.
[69:38.35]Oh man, this is not good.
[69:39.57]I'm gonna accidentally blow his sections up every time.
[69:46.20]I will blow him up every time.
[69:47.52]I need to make sure I don't aim the chicken over there.
[69:49.44]The chicken is the problem.
[69:52.24]I should've replaced the chicken.
[69:53.36]Alright, if I die again, chicken's getting replaced.
[69:56.02]And we're only gonna do projectile shots.
[70:05.45]I'm gonna try to avoid blowing him up.
[70:10.55]Chest.
[70:19.04]Come on, I gotta get... I gotta time these.
[70:20.54]Get it with the bomb!
[70:21.84]Yes!
[70:26.75]Here we go.
[70:27.09]Alright, chicken.
[70:28.09]Do not aim the chicken over there.
[70:29.55]He's gonna cause a massive issue.
[70:30.95]Only bees.
[70:32.37]And only shooting the snake.
[70:34.15]Rapid venom snake.
[70:35.96]And freeze.
[70:46.80]Perfect, okay.
[70:52.46]Watch out.
[70:52.98]Watch out for that fucking stupid dumb bird.
[70:56.32]Don't go that way, bird.
[71:03.33]Oh, god damn it.
[71:03.89]It already happened.
[71:04.71]Alright.
[71:05.45]We gotta improvise.
[71:14.20]Two is alright.
[71:14.78]I can deal with two.
[71:27.55]Ah, shit.
[71:28.19]Sorry.
[71:28.39]Get rid of him.
[71:29.27]Just get rid of him.
[71:36.74]Good.
[71:38.98]God damn it.
[71:39.62]Get him, please.
[71:42.20]One more.
[71:42.52]Okay.
[71:45.92]Handled.
[71:47.05]Handled it.
[71:49.73]Did I?
[71:50.19]I'm not so sure now.
[71:51.61]We're good.
[71:51.91]I have a lot of shells.
[72:03.16]Hmm.
[72:12.58]Another cobra, maybe?
[72:13.54]I don't know what to do here.
[72:17.07]Another bee?
[72:17.81]Two bees?
[72:23.67]We do double bee and then we got these two on this side.
[72:25.83]Hmm.
[72:32.06]Extra life or another bee?
[72:37.42]I'm gonna go with another bee.
[72:40.09]Because I got a lot of shells to spend, and even if we lose, we have a lot of things to buy.
[72:44.29]Because we're definitely gonna lose at the boss, even if I get there.
[72:50.76]I got almost 100 shells to spend.
[72:59.79]I don't know what that is.
[73:01.51]Missile launcher or something?
[73:08.38]Still have the claw.
[73:10.52]This is perfect.
[73:11.20]Look at this.
[73:11.60]Look at the work these are gonna do in a second here.
[73:15.50]The beasts are just gonna shoot in random directions.
[73:20.81]I like it.
[73:21.69]It's working out pretty well.
[73:32.56]You know, I would actually dare say I want three bees.
[73:37.86]Can I replace my entire character with bees?
[73:45.52]Oh shit, watch out.
[73:46.88]We got missiles coming down.
[73:49.36]Yep.
[73:50.78]That's a new enemy.
[73:54.99]That does more damage.
[73:57.45]Can't really tell.
[74:00.25]A huge wave.
[74:02.11]Back it up.
[74:06.78]This is harmful to the global bee population.
[74:09.10]Why is that?
[74:09.68]I have two huge ones.
[74:10.66]I don't think these are gonna have a lot of babies.
[74:20.99]Oh, fuck.
[74:23.49]Watch out for the nukes!
[74:28.79]Get it!
[74:29.03]Come on, hit him!
[74:35.48]So what about the bosses here?
[74:37.18]New DNA.
[74:39.22]We're gonna get something new.
[74:40.57]Remember, always have the bees facing out.
[74:43.27]Quick little tip here, quick little gameplay tip.
[74:45.53]If you're gonna use the bees and have them on one side, make sure they're opposite the building you're currently shooting.
[74:50.79]They can do their own work and take care of any enemies that might be trickling in.
[74:55.82]Thanks for watching my video.
[75:00.86]That's been the whole video.
[75:06.10]DNA.
[75:06.56]What is it?
[75:09.52]Frog.
[75:10.62]Replace all arms with fucking frogs.
[75:13.56]Grabs and swings enemies.
[75:15.06]That's a bet.
[75:18.58]All of them.
[75:19.25]Wait, it's 800 dolls.
[75:20.13]Don't make the joke yet.
[75:20.83]What is it?
[75:23.29]Grabs and swings enemies.
[75:24.67]Very high damage.
[75:28.77]Replace claw with frog.
[75:43.53]Or is it time to get rid of the penguin?
[75:48.05]Alright, we did it.
[75:48.79]I don't know what it's gonna do, but... Alright, hold on.
[75:50.50]I got, like... I don't have any melee anymore.
[75:57.88]Should I... Lobster Claw instead of the, um... Penguin?
[76:06.15]You keep that penguin.
[76:11.87]The frog is melee, but he like swings people around.
[76:16.74]Melee is garbage.
[76:17.88]Unlog... I'm doing it.
[76:22.96]You know, everyone's gonna fucking freak out that I deleted their beloved penguin.
[76:28.62]And you need melee.
[76:30.90]We have the two bees.
[76:31.66]We're gonna be fine.
[76:32.22]The bees are the good projectile.
[76:33.97]Let's see what the frog actually even does.
[76:40.87]Is that just a melee swing?
[76:44.07]Oh, my... Okay.
[76:47.24]That's pretty cool.
[76:49.20]That's pretty cool.
[76:50.04]I'm not gonna lie.
[76:50.64]You can just swing him around and hit into stuff.
[76:53.78]Does it just do actual melee damage?
[76:55.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[76:56.18]Grab that.
[76:59.92]Oh, shit.
[77:00.54]It's actually kind of hard to control.
[77:06.10]Grab the nuke every time and just drag it over here.
[77:11.25]That's awesome.
[77:12.29]This is cool.
[77:13.53]That tug, this is great.
[77:15.13]Can I catch the things out of the air?
[77:22.03]Wow, easy.
[77:27.88]Just grab every explosive device you can.
[77:30.08]Just Jerma suplex it.
[77:34.30]That's something new, but no match for the frog.
[77:41.22]Might have to get more than one frog.
[77:44.81]He makes a ribbit noise too, it's perfect.
[77:48.85]Shit, I wasn't paying attention.
[77:50.07]I forgot- I didn't even follow my own gameplay tip.
[77:55.37]I was too preoccupied by the frog's cool move.
[78:07.22]Here comes the wave.
[78:11.40]Chicken might, it might be time to replace chicken.
[78:13.08]There is an electric fence here.
[78:15.47]Come on, Grappler, come on, come on!
[78:17.31]Oh shit!
[78:19.43]I tried to do a fucking fancy move and nobody even got to laugh at it.
[78:25.33]Nobody even thought it was cool, like I almost had a chance to do something cool there.
[78:29.15]I still might be able to do something cool.
[78:37.84]Follow my fucking gameplay tip.
[78:41.65]The frog is really slow.
[78:42.75]Yeah, he is.
[78:44.67]It's okay, though.
[78:45.27]It's alright.
[78:48.86]We made it to the next level.
[78:49.66]94.
[78:53.42]Shells.
[78:53.94]We can do another frog.
[79:00.40]Oh, we can do another lobster.
[79:01.56]Should we do double frog?
[79:02.54]Oh, this is tough.
[79:06.95]Lobster replacing the chicken.
[79:08.85]Double frog or lobster claw?
[79:10.41]Yeah.
[79:27.72]I wanted... Alright, okay, alright, alright, no more, go.
[79:38.37]Oh, this is the boss, shit.
[79:43.89]I wanna do massive melee damage to stuff.
[79:46.56]Look at this, we're gonna be fine.
[79:48.62]It's all set.
[79:50.66]Check it.
[79:57.65]Oh, wow, I didn't see that guy.
[79:59.50]Oh, wow, I didn't see him.
[80:09.94]Sorry, here comes the massive building damage I was talking about.
[80:12.04]See?
[80:28.03]It actually worked out pretty well.
[80:30.15]Not terrible.
[80:34.92]The egg would have been pretty useful too, yeah.
[80:36.32]It's alright, we got it.
[80:38.54]Kongaroo.
[80:39.06]We're going with Kongaroo.
[80:41.66]We're going to absolutely lose to this boss.
[80:44.74]Okay, can I grab him?
[80:48.27]He does that.
[80:48.97]What can I hurt him?
[80:50.49]His face?
[80:50.93]I don't think I can grab this guy.
[80:58.94]Try and grab his face.
[80:59.70]No.
[81:00.34]Frogs are useless here.
[81:02.04]Mistake.
[81:04.68]I'm glad I have the fucking lobster claws, because these things are gonna just... Look at this.
[81:09.08]Let me first try this guy without getting hit.
[81:11.90]Hold on, here comes more shit.
[81:14.04]Boomerangs.
[81:14.60]They're just gonna be moving around the whole time, aren't they?
[81:17.82]Yes, they are.
[81:18.94]And they have to be destroyed with the snake.
[81:25.80]Yeah, I cannot shoot them.
[81:27.72]I cannot hit them with my hands.
[81:33.58]Those have to be hit with this.
[81:34.76]No, they can't.
[81:35.56]Oh god, this is gonna get hard.
[81:37.46]I'm gonna get hit.
[81:44.76]That fake out jump that he does.
[81:46.86]God damn it, the frogs are useless!
[81:51.00]Why did I have the frogs for?
[81:52.44]They're just wasting space.
[82:04.67]Come on!
[82:05.71]Don't get greedy.
[82:10.13]Oh, fuck.
[82:10.75]Please jump.
[82:11.51]Please jump.
[82:25.13]Fuck.
[82:28.61]Well, we're gonna have to do two bees here instead of the frogs.
[82:34.76]I gotta get rid of all frogs, actually.
[82:36.60]Because the frogs don't do anything here.
[82:43.61]Against this boss, at least.
[82:48.15]It's all about the bees, and it's all about... I've never fought one of these things by myself.
[82:52.41]I have training wheels on.
[82:54.59]I've never fought one of these by myself.
[83:02.31]That actually kind of makes things fairly difficult.
[83:04.53]Will you please?
[83:05.23]Honest to fucking God, nobody had anything.
[83:07.94]Nobody had a swing.
[83:08.82]Nobody had anything to do.
[83:09.58]Give me a break.
[83:18.80]I'm getting collapsed on.
[83:26.55]I'm fine.
[83:29.51]Here we go.
[83:33.24]I'm gonna let the bees do the work, and we're gonna stay far away from the dumb kangaroo.
[83:47.95]Two more.
[83:49.96]Good, that's fine.
[83:51.16]Just let him do that.
[83:51.80]Time for the bees.
[84:02.35]I want some distance here.
[84:09.46]Is he going to go straight in the air?
[84:10.84]Yes, he is.
[84:11.22]He's going to come across, isn't he?
[84:17.23]Nope.
[84:17.63]Straight up.
[84:21.75]Up and down?
[84:23.23]Yep.
[84:35.11]I got greedy.
[84:35.99]It's alright.
[84:36.40]He's gonna go up and down.
[84:37.24]Underneath.
[84:41.32]Okay, now I understand his patterns.
[84:44.02]Now I understand you.
[84:46.83]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[84:47.93]Baby kangaroo.
[84:51.73]That's new.
[85:03.78]Get him!
[85:05.08]There's still one dumb thing floating around.
[85:07.00]This is how we end it.
[85:09.17]Bingo.
[85:09.37]I don't even care if I get hit.
[85:10.75]It's gonna die.
[85:15.37]It's time to destroy the Opera House.
[85:20.99]Just don't die here.
[85:22.91]That would be a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad mistake.
[85:31.84]I didn't hit anything.
[85:33.02]Are you kidding me, dude?
[85:34.02]Alright, don't be an idiot.
[85:41.89]Alright, here we go.
[85:46.01]New bonus game, probably.
[85:47.95]So be prepared for it.
[85:49.09]Don't lose.
[85:49.81]Woo the starfish.
[85:53.19]Press both left and right mouse to attack five enemies.
[85:59.41]Oh no.
[86:03.51]Here we go again.
[86:04.07]It's time to be more proactive about where you're going.
[86:13.49]Pay attention to the top of the screen.
[86:20.62]Nice, okay.
[86:23.00]We got... moving faster now.
[86:31.24]Don't waste the special move until you actually desperately need to use it.
[86:41.61]So far, it's so good.
[86:50.47]Where, where, where, where, where?
[86:51.59]I'm going to guess right side.
[86:53.39]Nope, right in the middle.
[87:00.56]Didn't even need to use it.
[87:01.48]Alright.
[87:02.58]That move is probably pretty cool.
[87:05.12]Turtle DNA.
[87:06.58]Blocks bullets.
[87:15.82]Well, I can do this.
[87:17.92]I don't think I want to use that, though.
[87:24.37]Turtle shell.
[87:25.25]Another cobra.
[87:25.95]I could replace the cobra and have two cobras here.
[87:30.07]Only turtles.
[87:33.74]Starfish?
[87:34.16]I don't even know what this does.
[87:35.24]Yeah, I want a better snake.
[87:41.92]I like this.
[87:42.48]I don't want to change this.
[87:47.06]All turtles and one crab.
[87:48.49]You probably could do that if you really wanted to.
[87:51.31]Just play super defensively.
[87:57.58]Only Turtles or Riot.
[87:58.96]I can only do one.
[87:59.98]We're gonna do this.
[88:06.21]We're on the third level here.
[88:07.31]We're gonna see what other YouTube video I get angry at and go on a rampage because of.
[88:24.04]Turtle only stops bullets.
[88:36.21]He turned me into a balloon animal.
[88:39.95]Stop laughing at me.
[88:47.85]Why is everything slow motion?
[88:55.17]This is so dumb.
[88:57.02]Alright.
[88:59.26]Destroy the Tokyo Imperial Palace.
[89:04.40]Alright.
[89:06.75]underwater let shots pass under your chin to dodge huh under your chin how does that even work alright I'm just trying to figure out how the hell that even works
[89:35.13]Oh, I get it.
[89:35.73]I see.
[89:37.35]You can't destroy those.
[89:40.07]I get it.
[89:40.43]You actually have to just dodge them.
[89:44.26]Well, that adds another layer.
[89:56.21]What?
[89:56.69]Big ass head.
[89:57.47]Yeah.
[90:03.28]I kind of want to just die and go unlock all the new things.
[90:08.62]I've been playing too well.
[90:10.58]You know what I mean?
[90:11.04]I've been playing like too good.
[90:20.01]So it has to go under the chin.
[90:21.79]Okay.
[90:23.39]That sucks.
[90:24.69]I am not going to pay attention to that after like five minutes.
[90:34.03]You better believe that that's going to be the downfall of the rest of the entire stream.
[90:38.83]Oh, come on, really?
[90:42.01]I wanted to die.
[90:43.75]You made it to Tokyo Ocean 1.
[90:45.05]Spend your shells.
[90:47.77]Look at this.
[90:48.95]There's a lot of stuff we have to do.
[90:53.33]King Cobra DNA.
[90:56.54]This is like level 3 version.
[91:00.98]I did want to die.
[91:01.60]You just heard me say it.
[91:03.38]Shoots spread.
[91:05.62]Coral blocks two hits.
[91:07.66]What the hell is that?
[91:12.04]Narwhal DNA horn deals extreme damage.
[91:18.23]Blocks bullets plus bites enemies.
[91:21.89]See which enemies are on the next level.
[91:26.11]Shortcut lets you skip past New York Ocean.
[91:29.61]Oh no.
[91:31.78]We have to do this.
[91:32.68]Otherwise we have to play through everything.
[91:36.64]What do you think?
[91:37.00]Should we get this now?
[91:38.66]So we can not have to go through New York again?
[91:47.07]Kinda need to do the shortcut.
[91:52.16]Well, King Cobra, I love the projectiles, so I think we're going to have to do King Cobra.
[91:55.98]That's a legendary roll.
[91:59.78]I'm going to say Cobra and Portal.
[92:04.19]We're not starting at New York again, guys.
[92:06.57]Sorry.
[92:08.81]King Cobra.
[92:15.17]What do you mean, no Portal?
[92:16.39]That's what you're supposed to do!
[92:23.50]Cobra and Portal.
[92:29.42]Wait, what?
[92:33.57]I thought we skipped New York.
[92:41.85]I thought we skipped New York.
[92:44.87]Ah, there we go.
[92:45.37]See ya.
[92:51.16]And right off the bat, we get a lobster claw and a new tentacle.
[92:57.39]And another tentacle.
[92:58.13]Oh, look at this.
[93:03.73]Whoa, wait a minute.
[93:04.23]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[93:05.93]We just skipped the ocean part.
[93:08.48]Oh, that's, oh, that's, that's not, that wasn't worth it.
[93:12.04]That wasn't worth $50.
[93:19.20]It's alright.
[93:20.81]Don't even worry about it.
[93:21.61]We're gonna have to buy the shortcut like five times, you know.
[93:28.51]He can't reach it.
[93:29.80]Come here!
[93:32.22]Got it.
[93:39.16]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoopsie daisy.
[93:42.87]Missed out on all that money, but I don't want to do the ocean again.
[93:44.99]Fuck the ocean.
[93:45.73]Fuck the original ocean, it's the tutorial level.
[93:47.65]I don't want to do the tutorial, like, a million times.
[93:58.68]This is a very bad combination for these enemies.
[94:01.74]I need projectiles.
[94:02.58]Like, very, very badly.
[94:08.83]Should have got the fucking frog.
[94:09.98]Yeah, I know.
[94:11.92]It's alright.
[94:12.38]Once we get out of New York City, we're fine.
[94:22.78]Don't worry.
[94:23.18]Everything's good.
[94:23.87]We got a heart.
[94:26.25]Just die again?
[94:26.89]No.
[94:27.15]Why would I do that?
[94:34.59]Takes three hits with the regular default tentacles, too.
[94:39.84]this sucks oh the worst possible enemy of melee get out of here you stupid flying hammerhead alright we're fine calm wait let me get this before the level ends everything's fine got the shells
[95:09.10]I already got a Cobra.
[95:09.92]We don't have a King Cobra, though.
[95:11.17]Should I... Hmm.
[95:13.79]No, I need this.
[95:14.41]I need that now.
[95:16.77]I need them both, actually.
[95:24.67]No Puffer.
[95:25.15]I need damage, man.
[95:26.77]I can't get the Puffer.
[95:27.71]Puffer is just a crutch to rely on.
[95:29.35]I need actual damage.
[95:36.64]Now I can actually aim shots at stuff.
[95:38.08]What do you mean bad?
[95:38.98]That's the right call!
[95:40.64]I'm not gonna pick the buffer right now.
[95:43.50]Not what I have to deal with these stupid flying shark enemies.
[95:50.40]Oh, you stupid idiot.
[95:51.40]You went the wrong fucking way.
[96:02.97]Come here.
[96:03.47]Come here.
[96:06.39]Three, four, five.
[96:07.42]Blow that up.
[96:08.24]Come on, get it.
[96:08.70]Nice.
[96:14.58]You know, I want a longer range shot.
[96:16.12]It's definitely going to be in the game.
[96:18.24]It's going to be some random upgrade.
[96:25.84]There you go, you prick.
[96:27.83]There you go, you little prick.
[96:34.15]Streamer's a stupid idiot.
[96:36.53]Yeah.
[96:44.70]Look at this perfect target leading and it doesn't even matter.
[96:56.14]What did I admit?
[96:56.76]I admitted what?
[96:58.84]What am I admitting?
[97:02.50]I didn't admit anything.
[97:11.59]I hate these things!
[97:13.21]I need the bees!
[97:23.70]Have I considered going pro?
[97:28.98]Thought about it a couple times.
[97:32.98]Thought about it like a week ago.
[97:33.96]I was like, you know what?
[97:36.02]I'm gonna let you just go pro.
[97:37.98]I think I have what it takes.
[97:40.01]I could get just drafted on one of these pro teams.
[97:47.69]Alright, give me the Ultra Cobra.
[97:49.53]Damn it.
[97:51.87]Although... Hmm... I do have access to another one of these and a B. I could get him... Another Tentacle?
[98:00.02]No.
[98:00.38]No.
[98:03.24]I'm sorry.
[98:03.54]We have to do that.
[98:07.59]Get rid of the Statue of Liberty.
[98:11.35]No Puffer.
[98:11.93]No.
[98:12.11]I need to get a decent build first.
[98:15.63]We need double powerful shot and B. This game.
[98:28.55]I need the B for these guys.
[98:30.21]That's a guarantee.
[98:32.77]That's a Jeremy Elbertson guarantee.
[98:35.53]I need one of those guys.
[98:38.91]Puffer's the best?
[98:39.67]I'm sure it is.
[98:40.78]We'll get it after this.
[98:50.24]Why is this game so out of the screen?
[98:52.62]Wait, what are you talking about?
[98:55.00]What's wrong with the screen?
[99:00.55]Is there like a screen issue right now?
[99:06.27]What's this guy talking about?
[99:09.81]Where's the screen?
[99:15.95]Alright, here comes the butcher.
[99:19.83]For a second I thought my resolution was fucked up.
[99:21.75]I was like, really?
[99:22.39]What?
[99:26.89]I just got jibated.
[99:30.86]This guy's harder than the second boss.
[99:40.59]He really is.
[99:41.07]He's not harder, he just takes longer.
[99:46.11]I'll get another one.
[99:56.86]The mouse is predicting all of my moves.
[99:59.16]Oh, the mouse is on the screen.
[100:01.62]I mean, not much I can do about that.
[100:08.06]It's only left and right click.
[100:09.44]There's no other combination to do in the game.
[100:19.56]Okay.
[100:23.91]I had to do it.
[100:25.47]The grade was there, but it's okay.
[100:29.99]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, he's dead.
[100:39.51]Lots of money.
[100:42.57]Do my special attack?
[100:43.51]I don't have one.
[100:44.92]I do not have a special attack right now.
[100:48.62]Could you play this with a steering wheel?
[100:50.38]Uh, yes, you probably could.
[100:53.89]In fact, I guarantee you could do this to the steering wheel.
[100:56.54]It would just be left and right on the steering wheel.
[101:06.48]Banned for counting.
[101:07.69]No, I was saying one, two, three shots.
[101:16.99]The visual on the mouse is way off to the side.
[101:22.74]Like, alright, so the mouse is just right here.
[101:24.63]It's just left click moves left and right click moves you right.
[101:27.61]It doesn't... I don't have to be anywhere.
[101:31.57]The mouse just... It's just left click to move.
[101:35.03]Right click to move.
[101:35.79]That's it.
[101:36.09]That was almost bad, but it was good.
[101:47.10]We're fine.
[101:54.16]You know, I bet you you unlock when you beat the game challenge mode which is Something I'm looking forward to it's gonna be awesome Shit no, I don't miss out.
[102:07.69]Well, I missed out because I wanted to see what the move did Missed out on five shells.
[102:13.04]I'm angry.
[102:13.52]Oh
[102:21.44]Right up the middle.
[102:24.56]Damn it.
[102:24.94]Damn it.
[102:25.62]I can't get it.
[102:26.04]Damn it.
[102:26.48]It's alright.
[102:33.30]They make this... It's too addicting to want to get every single thing.
[102:36.34]Come on.
[102:44.71]Where are the shells?
[102:45.31]Where are my extra shells?
[102:50.48]Don't do me like this, man.
[102:56.94]I think it got a little harder.
[102:58.14]I think the level changes.
[102:59.72]I was fucked there.
[103:08.91]Had to do that.
[103:22.90]Those are worth doing.
[103:24.50]You get a lot.
[103:27.80]Alright.
[103:28.18]Well, hold on.
[103:30.30]Do I get... I'll get Starfish now.
[103:33.05]Let's get him.
[103:34.21]Got it.
[103:36.25]Starfish and another tentacle.
[103:43.50]Because then I... Now I'll put Crab Claw here.
[103:48.20]So it's to the both mouse buttons to just kind of freak out and attack everything.
[103:56.76]Now, dude, this is the Dark Souls of side-scrolling tentacle games.
[104:02.30]What does the starfish do?
[104:03.10]If I press both buttons at the same time, he goes crazy and attacks five enemies.
[104:07.94]From my understanding.
[104:11.64]I do miss the chicken, though.
[104:13.23]The chicken egg is very good for these enemies.
[104:16.51]Pro tip.
[104:18.97]You got your first car today.
[104:20.01]Any driver tips?
[104:22.45]Yeah, sure.
[104:23.37]I got a couple of driver tips for you.
[104:24.75]One very important one.
[104:27.03]Don't crash.
[104:29.37]That's it.
[104:31.13]Look, what you guys don't realize is driving a car, it's not about how well you drive.
[104:36.42]The whole thing is just try not to crash the car.
[104:39.86]That's it.
[104:43.14]You could go to driver's ed and all they're teaching you is
[104:46.68]Hey student, please don't drive into anything.
[104:50.40]As long as you're super proactive about that and you don't drive your car into something, you're gonna be a good driver.
[105:00.31]Fuck.
[105:01.21]Come on B, get it.
[105:02.91]God damn it, come on B, get it!
[105:04.01]Did I?
[105:06.13]I got it, nice.
[105:07.07]No I didn't.
[105:11.01]And don't, you know, don't drive too fast.
[105:14.05]Don't be an idiot.
[105:16.09]You know, you got these fucking yahoos that decide to drive really fast.
[105:20.55]Go like 90 on the highway.
[105:22.29]There's no reason to go that fast.
[105:25.96]You're putting yourself and other drivers in danger.
[105:27.84]Don't do it.
[105:36.14]And don't drive too slow either.
[105:40.73]You got the guy on the highway that goes...
[105:44.40]Like 48 miles per hour in the right lane.
[105:47.00]Don't be that person.
[105:50.02]Let's get the extra life.
[106:00.78]Don't drive.
[106:01.44]No, just don't go too fast.
[106:02.96]Don't... Guys, everything in life can be summarized by the Goldilocks fairy tale.
[106:09.12]Doesn't matter what it is.
[106:11.13]We could talk about driving a car.
[106:12.37]We could talk about using a computer.
[106:17.47]Don't go too fast.
[106:18.89]Don't go too slow.
[106:19.89]Go just right.
[106:28.34]Don't do something too much.
[106:29.92]Don't do something not at all.
[106:34.52]And don't microwave porridge.
[106:36.66]Don't be disgusting, okay?
[106:39.26]At least put it in the toaster oven and reheat.
[106:44.74]Goldilocks goes into somebody's house, breaks into their fucking living room, and drinks like cold old porridge that's been sitting there because the family decided they were gonna go on like a hunting trip.
[106:56.22]What?
[107:03.67]Where did the bears actually go in Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
[107:07.81]Where?
[107:08.03]What, are they going for a Sunday drive?
[107:10.97]Doesn't make any sense.
[107:13.87]Somebody in chat.
[107:14.57]Where did the bears go?
[107:16.11]Why'd they leave?
[107:21.50]They went on a walk while it cooled.
[107:24.76]Nobody... What?
[107:25.78]Why?
[107:28.00]Oh, well, we just made this delicious dinner tonight.
[107:31.24]You know, it's a little hot.
[107:32.41]Let's all leave the house.
[107:36.23]Oh, shit.
[107:36.45]Hold on.
[107:36.69]Pay attention.
[107:39.79]Oh, shit.
[107:40.23]I wasn't paying any attention.
[107:44.33]Got it, okay.
[107:44.77]Because there's nothing to do.
[107:46.99]You don't just leave the house.
[107:50.30]You make, dinner takes like not even one or two minutes to cool down.
[107:54.58]All you gotta do is just go like this.
[107:56.68]Pick up the fork, swirl it around, swirl the spaghetti around, whatever it is, the porridge, lift it up, lift it up with your hand cupping underneath, you know, you lift up the spoon with the porridge in it, hand underneath, and go, and put it, it hurts, but like it's fine, it's gonna be fine in two fucking seconds.
[108:22.54]Whatever utensil.
[108:23.52]You can use chopsticks.
[108:24.32]Who cares?
[108:24.78]Whatever you're using.
[108:27.40]Everybody does that.
[108:28.46]It doesn't matter what food it is.
[108:29.58]It could be pizza.
[108:30.36]It could be french fries.
[108:31.16]It could be soup.
[108:32.20]It could be a sandwich.
[108:32.96]It could be like a fucking deli sandwich.
[108:34.32]Everybody goes like this.
[108:34.88]You pick it up and you go... And you like suck in...
[108:42.96]Like, grow a pair, you know what I'm saying?
[108:45.77]Don't go fucking leave your house and go shopping for an hour and come back and eat old, crusty, film-on-the-top porridge.
[108:55.61]Don't disgust me, okay?
[108:57.06]Alright, let's go.
[109:10.15]Pizza?
[109:10.96]Eat pizza with chopsticks.
[109:17.90]I don't know why that's making me laugh, man.
[109:19.48]I'm just imagining somebody trying to pick it up.
[109:26.91]You would have to be on some kind of drug if you wanted to pick up pizza with chopsticks.
[109:37.49]Another... Holy shit, that doesn't... That's not going down.
[109:44.67]Got it.
[109:45.67]When does this let go?
[109:48.36]I think I have this forever.
[109:50.74]Oh boy, I'm gonna need this.
[109:52.52]Come here.
[109:52.74]Can I get my giant tongue?
[110:01.32]That actually worked really well, but it's alright.
[110:03.50]Just calm down.
[110:09.86]Just take it one piece at a time.
[110:16.33]No, no, no!
[110:19.93]Fuck.
[110:22.38]That was going so well.
[110:25.76]Speaking of going so well, frog is the best thing to have here.
[110:28.08]I just get like three frogs.
[110:32.76]You can pick up each individual head.
[110:41.15]Easy.
[110:45.98]Shit, I missed.
[110:46.52]Sorry.
[110:52.92]Frog makes this actually very easy.
[110:54.84]Wow!
[110:57.59]No!
[110:58.13]Shit!
[110:59.55]No!
[111:00.01]Don't do it again!
[111:00.97]God damn it!
[111:03.23]It's alright.
[111:08.57]Just calm down.
[111:11.27]None of these are any good.
[111:20.71]No.
[111:22.33]Save the money.
[111:24.29]I have the starfish, that's right, but the starfish wouldn't have done anything for me there.
[111:28.78]Yeah, maybe he would have.
[111:29.72]I freaked out.
[111:30.30]Did those electrical things hurt me?
[111:42.86]I'm gonna be surprised.
[111:44.06]I wonder if you can only use this once.
[111:46.44]The starfish.
[111:50.33]It's possible that it's only usable one time.
[111:57.41]That guy is shooting actual bullets.
[112:03.50]I don't want anything to do with that.
[112:08.50]Dance in the electricity.
[112:09.54]I really would.
[112:10.08]Don't tempt me.
[112:10.60]Don't fucking dare me.
[112:13.22]I'm one of those people that if you dare something, oh man, he does it.
[112:15.58]He's crazy.
[112:23.14]Dude, I dare you to take that meatball at the school lunch table, dunk it in yogurt, and then dip it in your french fries and cover it in mayonnaise and ketchup and eat it!
[112:38.26]And I go, okay, fine, man.
[112:40.29]Put the money on the table.
[112:41.29]It's like a fucking dollar.
[112:42.45]You know what I mean?
[112:45.23]And I fucking roll it in the dough and I put it in my mouth and everyone just goes like, oh, what a fucking crazy dude.
[112:50.72]Take the dollar, man.
[112:51.80]You earned it.
[112:52.36]I wasn't looking at the fucking chat.
[113:10.90]I'm looking at the chat again.
[113:12.22]Stop that.
[113:12.70]What do you think?
[113:14.06]You still got a streamer?
[113:14.96]You're supposed to look at chat?
[113:17.00]No, you're supposed to play the video game and win.
[113:26.33]I gotta get these.
[113:27.29]Oh man, I'm getting overwhelmed.
[113:29.39]Calm down.
[113:30.35]I'm overwhelmed.
[113:34.07]That thing sucks.
[113:36.36]But I think it actually just saved my life, though.
[113:38.84]Under the chin!
[113:39.58]Under the chin!
[113:40.16]It hit me right in the fucking forehead!
[113:42.30]Ugh!
[113:42.42]Alright, just go!
[113:44.26]Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[113:49.01]There's way too many of these!
[113:50.23]Did they increase the amount of enemies that are here?
[113:57.55]Look at how many there are!
[114:04.21]Just go!
[114:05.51]I'm trying!
[114:08.05]They increased the amount of enemies that are here now.
[114:10.53]Look at this!
[114:11.13]This is not even... I can't deal with this!
[114:14.23]It's too many!
[114:19.52]No, you... You can't just tell me to just go when there's a hundred enemies on the screen.
[114:33.35]Actually, he does recharge fairly quickly.
[114:41.41]Shit.
[114:42.81]Oh, shit.
[114:47.45]What hit me?
[114:48.57]What hit me?
[114:48.99]What even hit me?
[114:49.65]I don't... I don't even know what hit me.
[114:53.12]Come on, give me a... I need to replace something here.
[114:55.68]We need chickens.
[114:56.26]I don't know what to replace, but I need a chicken.
[115:06.82]That was a stupid thing.
[115:07.86]We gotta get rid of something here.
[115:09.32]I need a chicken.
[115:21.07]Hmm.
[115:23.19]Frog ain't doing so well here.
[115:24.79]Yeah, I agree.
[115:26.78]Had to happen.
[115:30.04]Now, the bee is still doing okay.
[115:37.40]The bee is still fine, guys.
[115:40.58]But this is why we have the chicken here.
[115:48.47]Something like that.
[115:49.05]You know what I'm trying to do.
[115:50.95]That doesn't mean it's gonna be a success.
[115:56.95]Okay, move out of the way.
[116:11.29]Please don't, don't, please don't.
[116:13.53]Chicken OP.
[116:14.82]Chicken OP.
[116:21.36]That's why I brought the chicken.
[116:23.10]So all you naysayers in the chat that were telling me, don't bring the chicken, what are you, an imbecile, idiot, dumb imbecile?
[116:29.93]Well, look what happened.
[116:37.11]All you guys calling me stupid, dumb, idiot, imbecile, idiot.
[116:41.37]Under the chin.
[116:41.97]No, just dodge.
[116:43.31]It's very slow.
[116:44.61]There's a nuke!
[116:46.48]Go!
[116:50.16]Oh, god damn it.
[116:51.75]Oh, there's so many of them.
[116:52.83]Come on, chicken.
[117:03.28]Hit it.
[117:04.92]Come on.
[117:05.66]Oh, that was close.
[117:06.92]Woo!
[117:13.66]Come down.
[117:15.68]What are you, some kind of idiot scientist?
[117:18.47]A huge wave of enemies is approaching, dude.
[117:21.75]Watch it.
[117:23.83]Make sure you aim that fucking chip on at them.
[117:32.60]I gotta move.
[117:34.98]Under the chin.
[117:36.64]Under the chin.
[117:37.58]Oh my god, there's so many.
[117:38.92]Under the chin!
[117:40.48]The nuke is gonna kill me.
[117:42.94]Oh god.
[117:45.49]That's why you bring the fucking chicken on, okay?
[117:49.72]What am I, am I saying chick on?
[117:52.84]Heaven got hit one time.
[117:53.74]Kills the chicken.
[118:01.32]The crowd goes wild.
[118:08.49]Ooh!
[118:09.27]Alright.
[118:11.09]We got big money here.
[118:11.91]We got a king cobra.
[118:15.22]Do I replace the King Cobra with one of the regular Cobras, or do I replace King Cobra with B?
[118:23.10]I don't know.
[118:24.58]This is the first epic, legendary card we've seen.
[118:31.63]New Tentacle?
[118:32.01]If I do New Tentacle, I can't get King Cobra.
[118:34.37]And this is going to re-roll next time, so no, I'm not doing that.
[118:38.73]Yeah, fuck the B. But the B is homing.
[118:44.41]We're going to remove one of these regular Cobras.
[118:46.03]We're going to go like this.
[118:46.91]Bingo.
[118:51.39]Because if I had waited and I bought another Tentacle, then this would have rolled again and that's probably a pretty small chance to get one of these.
[119:02.88]Looking good.
[119:05.08]Let's see how much better this is.
[119:08.38]Remember how surprised I was at how good this one is?
[119:12.33]holy shit it is like rapid fire with a ton of damage I don't like freak out about this just like get it done this is gonna save me 10 holy shit that was 10 shells there alright I gotta get rid of you right now can I get a double there come on under the chin
[119:48.02]Where is it going?
[119:49.52]We're good.
[119:51.86]Let's be preemptive.
[119:52.78]Get rid of them before they crawl all the way over here.
[119:56.56]Use the chicken and miss every single shot with the chicken.
[119:59.44]Good job.
[120:00.22]Nice work, dude.
[120:00.82]You're doing a great job.
[120:03.83]Why am I just being somebody in chat?
[120:05.77]Like making fun of me?
[120:08.25]Am I projecting here?
[120:09.95]What's going on?
[120:21.38]Easy.
[120:23.94]Two nukes.
[120:24.82]One of these nukes has to go right now.
[120:27.54]Oh, fuck.
[120:27.90]Okay, we're good.
[120:29.58]Wait, there was another one.
[120:30.38]Whoa, that was lucky.
[120:32.76]That actually could have been really bad.
[120:43.75]Watch the ground.
[120:48.15]Local streamer forgets who he is on stream.
[120:53.22]No, I've never forgotten who I was.
[120:55.35]Maybe where I was.
[120:56.45]Maybe where I am is a good way to put that.
[121:00.55]Nothing more, nothing less, though.
[121:02.61]Oh, shit.
[121:04.83]We gotta move.
[121:07.40]I need some chicken action here right now.
[121:13.22]You know how fucked I would have been right there?
[121:15.68]If I did not bring the chicken here.
[121:21.45]That is a lifesaver situation.
[121:26.11]I still have my starfish, so... Let's get rid of this guy before he causes a problem.
[121:33.24]Didn't even get rid of him.
[121:36.42]In fact, I just ruined everything.
[121:42.82]One, two, three...
[121:47.39]Oh, fuck up.
[121:48.23]I just stopped paying attention.
[121:49.25]I'm not gonna lie.
[121:50.57]I was just like, where am I?
[121:58.10]We're good.
[121:59.02]I have... There's so many things back here.
[122:00.76]Get rid of them, please.
[122:04.57]I'm surrounded by nukes.
[122:08.17]Oh, whoa!
[122:09.79]What the fuck am I saying?
[122:14.39]This game is good.
[122:16.05]This is a good game.
[122:17.87]Alright, you heard it here.
[122:18.77]How long was it?
[122:19.75]Like two hours?
[122:20.23]It's a good game.
[122:25.23]This game's good.
[122:28.37]What does it get for a grade?
[122:29.37]A D!
[122:30.31]No, I'm kidding.
[122:35.87]It's been two hours and five minutes.
[122:43.09]Two hours of dehydration.
[122:44.67]Not true!
[122:51.48]Well, I can't do anything.
[122:52.28]Should I save money or just get a shell?
[122:55.98]I like this so far.
[122:57.47]Let's just get it.
[123:00.77]Might as well buy it.
[123:05.53]Save.
[123:06.07]Stop telling me to save the game.
[123:07.57]It's not even relevant anymore.
[123:12.82]Stop saying the word save.
[123:14.08]There's no relevancy.
[123:16.38]You at least have to have... Look, if there was a save game capability in this game, then sure, you could say that.
[123:21.91]But there's no save game capability in here.
[123:23.73]Don't say it anymore.
[123:32.39]There we go, bingo.
[123:35.99]Exit.
[123:37.81]Look, don't you want to see me blow up like Darth Vader's spaceship here?
[123:45.88]That wasn't meant to be a joke.
[123:47.78]I'm not making a joke with that.
[123:48.78]I'm just making a dumb, like, observation.
[123:51.28]You can tell what, look, always, guys, you can tell when I'm about to make, like, a joke.
[123:54.84]When I go, listen to this.
[123:56.38]What about this?
[123:57.73]That's how you know a joke is coming out.
[123:58.97]That wasn't a joke.
[123:59.51]I was just saying a word.
[124:01.55]Did I start that phrase or that sentence with, let's talk about this for a second.
[124:06.41]No, I didn't.
[124:17.32]I did not say that.
[124:18.75]So that's how you know there wasn't a joke incoming.
[124:26.27]Can we talk about this for a second?
[124:29.31]Here we go.
[124:30.17]Kongaroo easy.
[124:33.31]It'll be much easier now with these items.
[124:38.22]You know what?
[124:38.50]Why don't we just run off the bed?
[124:41.70]I didn't do anything.
[124:42.88]I'm actually very disappointed.
[124:49.70]Straight up.
[124:50.32]Get some claw action here, maybe.
[124:51.45]Come on.
[125:00.81]Got it.
[125:01.15]Just don't get too cocky, though.
[125:02.17]Just because you know this boss is not hard, doesn't mean it can't cause real problems for you.
[125:12.48]Can it be out there?
[125:13.08]Come on!
[125:15.48]The only time I used it, it didn't work.
[125:18.91]Right?
[125:19.13]I know.
[125:23.75]Where's he jumping?
[125:24.39]Give me a couple eggs.
[125:29.55]Watch it!
[125:30.19]Don't get cocky!
[125:31.13]I can hit him once.
[125:34.45]It's alright.
[125:35.21]That actually recharges very quickly.
[125:37.05]I'm giving that too much shit.
[125:39.07]I need to give that a little bit more slack.
[125:43.37]Because that thing is actually really great.
[125:47.22]Doesn't take very much time to recharge.
[125:50.20]You can tell by the Super Mario Bros.
[125:51.82]2 Yoshi's Island bubble around him that it's very soon I'm going to be able to use him.
[126:01.99]Got more eggs.
[126:02.59]I'm going to get hit.
[126:06.65]It's alright.
[126:07.21]He's dead.
[126:07.95]What are you doing?
[126:08.42]I'm going to get a free refill next round anyways.
[126:18.23]Oh, by the way, can we talk about this for a second?
[126:20.25]What's going on with the free refills?
[126:21.81]Uh, recently.
[126:22.31]Anyone notice this?
[126:24.35]Nobody gives free refills anymore.
[126:28.41]When was the last time, like, there are no free refills in fast food places anymore.
[126:32.11]They yell at you.
[126:35.78]Especially when you bring in, like, more than one cup.
[126:40.50]Chip...
[126:47.26]Such a Seinfeld joke.
[126:54.64]Now you guys get it.
[126:55.70]You're getting it now.
[126:57.38]This makes me happy.
[127:01.24]I don't ask for... Look, everybody knows you just walk up and do it, but some employees yell at you.
[127:06.94]I bring in like four or five cups.
[127:09.16]I just want to get some free refills.
[127:10.51]I already paid for my drink.
[127:12.23]I've consumed the beverage.
[127:13.37]I paid the $1.49 for that large drink.
[127:16.63]I'm gonna bring in a two liter bottle of empty soda and fill it up!
[127:21.84]Or a couple gallon jugs that are empty of water that I'd fill with old Pepsi.
[127:25.60]Oh my god, so relatable.
[127:34.21]I don't actually do that, I pay double for my drinks.
[127:44.71]Oh no, what am I supposed to do?! !
[127:50.81]Why old Pepsi?
[127:51.77]Because you think they changed that shit out?
[127:55.07]Look, as somebody that used to be a manager of Burger King, I can tell you they don't change that shit out.
[128:00.21]I used to be district manager of Burger King.
[128:03.75]In my county, okay?
[128:06.37]Those drink refills that we're talking about, it's a bag of Pepsi.
[128:11.07]They change it once a month, okay?
[128:12.92]That Pepsi goes in there and every month a new one comes in.
[128:24.28]Alright, let me backstep that a little bit here.
[128:26.86]I feel like somebody's gonna be very upset about that I just said that.
[128:42.41]It gets changed every time it runs.
[128:46.91]I know, I'm just being a dickhead.
[128:48.12]Look, Burger King is a clean, established restaurant.
[128:53.42]Clean is maybe not the right word there.
[128:55.72]Burger King is a restaurant that serves food fast.
[129:01.54]And you get it, you eat it, and sometimes it might be cold.
[129:05.52]Sometimes.
[129:06.38]I've gone to Burger King at least... Let's realistically talk about this.
[129:11.06]I've probably gone to Burger King maybe like a hundred times in my life.
[129:17.20]Maybe 200 times total in my entire life.
[129:19.98]Maybe that might be too high.
[129:25.82]I don't know.
[129:26.90]But out of like 160 times I've ever been to Burger King, my food has been cold and old maybe 25 times, like maybe 30 times.
[129:43.23]Yes, I've been to Burger King probably 200 times.
[129:49.47]But you... That's... Think about that.
[129:53.39]You only went to the place you managed... I never managed to Burger King.
[129:55.87]I just said that to make you guys think I was cool.
[130:00.08]I don't know.
[130:00.70]That wouldn't be... Nobody would probably think that was cool, though.
[130:09.46]That might be too much.
[130:10.04]I'm trying to think of the amount of times I've actually been to Burger King.
[130:13.74]If we're talking total fast food...
[130:16.55]That means I would have eaten Burger King, like, over the course of my life once almost an entire year straight.
[130:20.89]I'm not sure that's real, but it might be.
[130:23.79]It actually might be true.
[130:31.92]Is it, though?
[130:32.52]Hold on.
[130:32.88]Like, when I was a teenager, I went to Burger King, like, fucking twice a week.
[130:37.00]No, did I?
[130:37.90]Yes.
[130:40.58]So if I went to Burger King, like, twice a week when I was, like, from 14 to, like, 17...
[130:47.75]You're talking about, that's 52 weeks in a year.
[130:54.69]I'm in trouble.
[130:55.65]I'm in deep shit.
[130:57.55]Yep, I knew I was gonna get hit there.
[131:00.80]52 weeks in a year.
[131:02.34]So 2 times 52, that's like 100... Let's just say 100 times.
[131:06.36]100 times a year?
[131:09.28]No, that's not true!
[131:10.82]I don't go to Burger King 100 times a year when I was in high school.
[131:17.85]Oh man, that would be very bad.
[131:19.15]I would probably be like 500 pounds if that was the game.
[131:29.10]I've been to Burger King 365 times a year.
[131:33.12]You'd be dead.
[131:36.44]Everyone gives fast food shit, and look, I'm not going to give fast food shit.
[131:40.78]Mainly because I'm going to get hit again, because I'm just talking.
[131:45.27]This is like a hard level.
[131:47.15]But look, people give fast food all kinds of shit.
[131:49.63]I'm not going to be one of those people.
[131:50.83]I like going to Burger King.
[131:52.17]I like going to Taco Bell.
[131:53.25]Not that often, but sometimes.
[131:55.43]People talk all this shit about it.
[131:57.07]It's so bad for you.
[131:58.29]It's so bad for everything.
[131:59.75]Yeah, but it's like a fucking dollar.
[132:02.95]Something can be said about going to Burger King and spending like four dollars and getting like three sandwiches.
[132:13.60]Oh, we can get a new tentacle here.
[132:17.25]Let's put it in between these two.
[132:22.37]And this gives me another chance for... I wanna... mmm... Should I try... I'm gonna try the turtle shell.
[132:27.98]Let's just see how it is.
[132:29.66]Just for shits.
[132:34.74]A dolla.
[132:35.04]It's a dolla!
[132:36.20]You can get a mick... a mick, um... You can get, like, a mick, uh... a mick double.
[132:42.97]Not for a burger cake.
[132:45.25]You can get a mick double.
[132:48.49]New enemy type.
[132:54.51]You can get a McWopper.
[132:55.79]What is blowing up?
[133:01.80]No, okay, it's that.
[133:07.20]Shit's getting real now.
[133:13.96]Nah, but people give a lot of shit to fast food, but a lot of people don't.
[133:17.04]Like, I'm telling you, the same people that give fast food all kinds of shit are probably the same people that eat it all the time.
[133:22.44]And they just, like, pretend like they don't eat it.
[133:25.42]Wow, you actually eat McDonald's?
[133:28.95]Wow, you're disgusting.
[133:30.83]I can't believe, really?
[133:32.25]You know how bad that is for you?
[133:35.41]Like, fast forward, cut to, like, a day later, they're in the drive-thru.
[133:39.40]Yeah, I'll take a Big Mac meal and a large fry.
[133:45.95]Can you guys still supersize here?
[133:49.21]Is that still legal?
[133:50.19]Give me a break.
[133:55.87]Look, supersizing I think is illegal now.
[133:59.11]It's against the law.
[134:06.39]I really think it is.
[134:07.75]Oh, no, get it.
[134:08.21]Don't get hit.
[134:08.99]I'm gonna get hit.
[134:14.55]No, super... I'm telling you, look up... Type into Google right now.
[134:17.78]Is supersizing illegal?
[134:20.80]And I bet you're gonna get, like, at least three or four scenarios where I think it's been banned in, like, three states.
[134:26.22]Oh, my God.
[134:26.74]Those things fly at you hard.
[134:29.76]Pay attention here.
[134:30.38]I'm good.
[134:34.47]That was a little hairy.
[134:35.29]There.
[134:39.97]It was from Super Size, yeah.
[134:42.97]Everybody's seen the Super Size Me documentary.
[134:44.70]That guy ate Burger King at McDonald's for like a year straight.
[134:47.82]No, what was it, like two months?
[134:50.44]And he died.
[134:50.92]That guy died.
[134:52.66]At the end of the documentary, he's dead.
[134:54.00]It's like his funeral and they're burying him.
[134:56.86]It's crazy.
[135:00.80]Ah, this thing sucks.
[135:05.96]The documentary, the guy eats McDonald's for like three years straight.
[135:10.30]And he died.
[135:11.38]That guy died.
[135:18.77]Okay, we're doing Puffer.
[135:21.74]Hold on, so how does it determine what goes first?
[135:23.88]I have two of these guys.
[135:32.52]He ate Burger King for almost 10 years.
[135:35.40]They filmed every day.
[135:36.34]Not only did he just die, the guy died at the end of the documentary.
[135:42.76]So did somebody in his family, too.
[135:45.62]They weren't even eating the McDonald's.
[135:48.23]Just by association, they died, too.
[135:51.67]Really interesting documentary.
[136:01.48]Yeah, I guess like he was eating so much McDonald's that it killed somebody else in his family.
[136:06.51]Alright, fucking s- enough!
[136:07.71]Like, I need to play.
[136:09.09]Otherwise we're gonna- Alright, let me fucking just play.
[136:16.43]Ah, okay.
[136:17.99]I don't want to lose this.
[136:23.68]Let's get- this thing sucks.
[136:24.84]We're gonna get rid of it.
[136:26.52]I want another chicken here.
[136:27.44]This thing's dumb.
[136:31.87]Yeah, his brother had like secondhand McDonald's and it killed him.
[136:36.33]No, we're done with the joke.
[136:37.49]Move on and play the game and don't lose.
[136:39.13]Thank you.
[136:40.05]There's gonna be eggs everywhere.
[136:46.21]This is gonna be perfect.
[136:46.90]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[137:00.36]I gotta hit these guys with the little bullets.
[137:03.40]Remember, like I told you, focus on one or two body parts and the rest will just work for you.
[137:06.95]It's too hard to pay attention to all the arms.
[137:08.37]At least in my opinion.
[137:15.57]Maybe some of you gamers can be aware of every arm that's shooting, but not me.
[137:21.65]I require training wheels.
[137:31.12]Oh fuck.
[137:32.60]That was close.
[137:33.54]All of that was close.
[137:35.24]Let's not do that again.
[137:36.06]Here comes a mini-boss of this area.
[137:42.44]Who knows what it's gonna be?
[137:43.46]It's... Okay, it's part two of Big Boss Shooter Bats.
[137:47.46]Oh god.
[137:54.15]Okay, as long as you do- WHAT?!
[137:56.31]Oh, they came around!
[137:57.33]It came around!
[137:58.83]Fuck.
[138:00.62]Oh, it's gotta go under the chin.
[138:04.16]How does this one go under the chin?
[138:05.10]Like that, okay.
[138:11.58]Ugh.
[138:13.38]Which way is this one going?
[138:15.40]Like this?
[138:17.67]It's too... I keep hearing like the chicken laying eggs and... I don't know what hit me.
[138:21.59]I don't know what it was.
[138:22.21]What was it?
[138:22.63]I have no idea.
[138:24.53]I don't know.
[138:24.83]Did he shoot something else?
[138:27.85]I think he shoots something else.
[138:31.32]What else is he shooting?
[138:36.50]I can't... I don't know.
[138:40.62]Fuck.
[138:41.50]Where is it?
[138:42.64]Uh...
[138:46.22]This is wild, man.
[138:48.66]Oh, okay.
[138:50.67]If only I had the turtle shell now.
[138:52.19]Yeah, really.
[138:56.39]Use the starfish?
[138:57.09]I keep forgetting to use the stupid moves.
[139:03.00]We're saving up money.
[139:09.38]Hmm.
[139:10.26]Not worth it.
[139:11.66]Although, what if... Now I'm going to give you a what-if scenario.
[139:14.81]What if I did three chickens?
[139:18.25]Would that be dumb?
[139:18.89]Would you guys hate me for that?
[139:24.73]Should I just do three chickens?
[139:29.51]Bad idea.
[139:30.95]Chickens are bad.
[139:31.51]The chickens have been saving me.
[139:35.15]That's terrible.
[139:35.81]Dumb.
[139:36.01]We would hate you.
[139:36.75]Stupid.
[139:37.07]You're an idiot.
[139:37.79]What?! !
[139:43.05]I would hate you.
[139:43.73]Don't do it.
[139:44.21]Bad.
[139:44.47]Alright.
[139:44.79]Bad.
[139:45.07]Alright.
[139:45.47]Bad!
[139:46.41]Bad!
[139:46.79]I get it!
[139:47.57]Let's just go.
[139:48.05]I'm gonna save the money.
[139:52.67]We have not gone this far.
[139:57.24]Ooh, this is cool.
[139:57.80]This is Tokyo.
[140:00.66]I do have my two specials.
[140:01.68]I need to remember to use them.
[140:03.86]I'm getting new enemy types.
[140:06.82]We got these things, whatever they are.
[140:10.50]Just little mini versions of that boss.
[140:13.58]Fuck.
[140:16.96]Little mini versions of that boss?
[140:18.64]Fuck.
[140:21.32]These things are back.
[140:26.51]Sit here for a second while these blow up.
[140:33.81]All clear.
[140:39.90]I don't like this Cobra.
[140:40.56]This Cobra's fucking me up wicked bad.
[140:42.60]Don't like it.
[140:44.16]That's gotta get replaced.
[140:48.73]Yeah, looks like we're gonna have to repeal and replace those chickens.
[140:54.20]No, not the chickens.
[140:55.12]Wrong policy.
[141:04.86]You know, I break a lot of my own fucking rules.
[141:07.06]Wait, slow down.
[141:09.36]What happened?
[141:10.10]Okay, that one goes for... Oh!
[141:22.26]Get it!
[141:24.76]Long range.
[141:25.52]Come on, that's the one.
[141:28.24]Get that chest, don't let it get away.
[141:30.28]Nice.
[141:37.49]Even the chickens are low damage.
[141:39.04]That's fine, though.
[141:39.62]But they just cause so much splash damage to random stuff that I can't even see half the time.
[141:46.16]I like them.
[141:50.32]You might call me all kinds of bad words.
[141:54.67]But I'm sorry.
[141:55.31]I'm going to stick with the chickens.
[142:00.27]I didn't even, I didn't, I actually didn't even mean to do that.
[142:02.30]I actually just, I pressed, I pressed both mouse buttons at the same time because I just was trying to get away and I used my special.
[142:08.54]Huge wave.
[142:10.20]Here it comes.
[142:17.91]Full chicken run?
[142:18.71]No, I think that might be overkill.
[142:22.31]I just can't wait to see the speedruns of this game with all just standard tentacles.
[142:25.97]And only two.
[142:28.81]Right?
[142:30.01]And why did that happen?
[142:30.89]Oh, because I asked that question if this was going to affect anything in the game, and I thought it wasn't, and then I thought it did, but it doesn't.
[142:36.45]But it does.
[142:37.05]You actually get frozen.
[142:37.91]It paralyzes you.
[142:38.67]No damage, though.
[142:39.29]Good.
[142:44.72]Let's get some more damage over here.
[142:46.60]We've got three nukes coming up.
[142:50.66]We might have to use...
[142:58.88]Sorry.
[143:00.88]That was dangerous there.
[143:04.08]Why are you doing- what are you questioning?
[143:15.63]What did I- what did I just say?
[143:18.63]Come on, give me some better rolls than this shit.
[143:21.03]No, I want to save.
[143:23.49]I mean, I go-
[143:28.08]Chicken?
[143:29.94]Chicken?
[143:34.74]You're implying that I have a brain.
[143:37.48]Of course I have a brain.
[143:38.58]How would I be able to talk?
[143:44.87]Have you heard that McDonald's fries cure baldness?
[143:47.51]That's bullshit.
[143:52.07]No, I'm not going to buy anything.
[143:56.29]We'll have enough to get another tentacle and maybe one more thing at the end of this level here.
[144:01.72]And then I'll be able to get another chicken for free.
[144:05.88]New enemy.
[144:06.46]What is it?
[144:07.06]It's a launcher.
[144:09.12]Artillery.
[144:11.00]Oh, it's artillery.
[144:11.94]Fuck.
[144:14.46]You got two artilleries shooting at me?
[144:16.89]Fuck.
[144:18.81]Fuck.
[144:22.12]Two fucking Artilleries, dude.
[144:23.38]Alright, fuck you.
[144:25.62]Not you, fuck me.
[144:26.68]Not fuck you, fuck you to me.
[144:35.70]McDonald's fries make you... Alright, somebody... I thought... Somebody said something very sexualized there and they didn't.
[144:41.98]That was me sexualizing it for no reason.
[144:44.28]Fuck.
[144:47.06]Alright, we might have to go for a little bit of a fart here.
[144:49.47]No, we don't.
[144:49.87]Yes, we do.
[145:00.37]Bingo.
[145:03.59]Are you fucking me?
[145:07.73]Why did I read that?
[145:09.53]Of all the things in the chat, I turned... This is my brain.
[145:12.93]Man, I can't... I don't know why it doesn't... I look over and the first thing I see in all capitals and I read it out loud.
[145:20.28]Why?
[145:23.29]Look, I'm interacting!
[145:24.79]All the streamers playing this really intense pay attention to the game.
[145:28.39]It's very hard to pay attention.
[145:30.11]But look over and read one thing in chat to make sure chat knows you're interacting with them.
[145:35.17]And I read that.
[145:36.86]Of everything that was right there, there was like 500 sentences.
[145:41.88]Fuck.
[145:46.42]Interacting!
[145:47.56]He's interacting!
[145:50.79]That thing is great.
[145:51.39]I think it's very good.
[145:52.25]That's well worth 2,500 seashells on the seashore.
[145:59.39]Can you just blow up already?
[146:04.65]Get out of the way.
[146:06.45]Now I have to destroy you, too.
[146:12.13]God damn it, I'm just stuck here.
[146:15.03]God damn it, seashells on the seashore.
[146:23.73]Alright, you're really trying my patience here, game.
[146:26.65]Don't fucking hit me.
[146:29.54]Alright, can- please can I go?
[146:31.04]Just go.
[146:31.54]Go!
[146:36.96]I have to go.
[146:37.66]I'm not gonna s- I- I'm gonna have to turn around and it's not gonna work.
[146:46.22]Watch it!
[146:46.76]Chin!
[146:51.97]Got it.
[146:52.99]Woo!
[146:55.39]We are at the Tokyo boss.
[147:00.16]This is super exciting.
[147:01.50]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[147:23.80]They're coming from all angles.
[147:26.40]The hell hit me?
[147:39.79]Frog going to help you?
[147:40.51]Yeah, probably.
[147:42.83]You are probably right.
[147:48.47]Come on.
[147:48.93]Blow it up.
[147:49.49]Claw.
[147:50.96]Come on.
[147:51.44]I need you now, Claw.
[147:52.36]I need you.
[147:54.57]I need you to do this now.
[147:55.73]I need you to get rid of this right now.
[147:57.54]Thank you.
[147:58.18]End level.
[147:58.58]Nice.
[147:59.86]What the hell hit me?
[148:06.70]Last opportunity before the boss.
[148:08.94]And it's a bunch of garbage.
[148:13.48]This is a tough call.
[148:15.70]Because all this stuff sucks except for this.
[148:19.06]I could get an extra life.
[148:22.96]Adding a tentacle is probably stupid here because it's the boss and I'm gonna get a baby tentacle and I can't put anything on it.
[148:31.34]I think life is the correct answer.
[148:36.36]I do.
[148:39.07]Two things.
[148:39.63]One, shut the fuck up.
[148:40.95]What was the second thing?
[148:43.39]You didn't say the second thing.
[148:47.91]Tentacle with a shell?
[148:52.08]I wonder where it should go.
[148:53.68]Probably like here.
[148:54.34]Yeah, let's go like opposites here.
[149:00.39]Like here.
[149:02.87]Turtle shell?
[149:05.01]Well, it's a done deal.
[149:05.75]Whatever it is.
[149:06.31]Let's see what this does.
[149:08.07]I did it.
[149:09.02]One person in chat said to do this.
[149:11.00]The one guy in chat.
[149:12.18]Happy birthday, by the way.
[149:13.52]It's your birthday.
[149:14.08]It was that guy's birthday.
[149:16.04]So, make fun of me.
[149:17.98]What the fuck are you doing?
[149:18.82]You're an idiot, dude.
[149:19.66]It's that guy's birthday.
[149:21.10]Happy fucking birthday.
[149:21.96]That's what he asked for.
[149:22.61]That was his request.
[149:35.75]Wow, this is a lot of space now.
[149:39.46]This is now getting out of control.
[149:42.12]Oh, I need to focus on something.
[149:44.71]Oh, there's too many things.
[149:48.26]I can't focus.
[149:49.46]There's too many arms.
[149:50.40]I shouldn't have got this other arm.
[149:59.68]I can still get it.
[150:01.04]I can still get it.
[150:02.32]Got it!
[150:04.21]And it was a heart too.
[150:05.29]That was worth it.
[150:10.93]We're fine.
[150:14.98]I need this big snake.
[150:16.88]Not the baby snake.
[150:18.66]Should have replaced the baby snake.
[150:25.79]Fucking turtle shell.
[150:26.63]All I did is gave myself an extra arm with a wart on it.
[150:30.31]Didn't do anything good for me.
[150:31.89]Oh no.
[150:34.78]That's got to get activated.
[150:35.60]Come on, activate that, please.
[150:36.70]Hurry up.
[150:37.68]Hurry up and activate it.
[150:45.42]Watch out for that bullet.
[150:46.46]I know it's going to screw me if I don't do... Okay, don't do anything dumb.
[150:51.20]I almost got hit by that, but it's okay.
[150:54.18]Here comes the bomb.
[150:57.49]Keep moving.
[150:57.95]Whoa!
[150:59.09]That was another one that blew up.
[151:00.41]I thought they both blew up at the same time, but they didn't.
[151:01.93]Alright, wish me luck.
[151:05.07]Tokyo Boss.
[151:07.25]Stomp-a-tron X is approaching.
[151:11.07]I wonder what you're going to do.
[151:12.47]Maybe you're going to stomp.
[151:15.07]It's a giant McDonald's logo.
[151:18.27]Yep.
[151:21.18]Hmm, okay.
[151:22.90]I just wanna watch this for a second.
[151:26.94]Just like that old Contra boss, you're gonna stay underneath his head.
[151:33.52]And then he eventually does a giant laser, shooting where exactly?
[151:37.94]Straight down.
[151:38.48]Okay, so it's a question of getting in, waiting till the la- getting out when the laser comes out.
[151:42.46]So one, two, three, action.
[151:53.49]Might as well use it, right?
[151:54.59]Oh god, get out.
[151:56.69]Okay, that's fine.
[151:58.83]Really needed melee here.
[152:01.95]I need to have at least two or three crab claws, but I think I'll be fine.
[152:04.53]This should be easy enough.
[152:11.83]His phase is going to change here.
[152:13.83]Into something else.
[152:15.73]Here it comes.
[152:16.19]His phase two coming in.
[152:18.93]Whatever you're going to do, he hasn't done... Wait, wait, wait.
[152:22.17]Bullets!
[152:22.79]They're bullets?
[152:23.73]They're bullets.
[152:24.27]Get me out of this.
[152:26.03]Okay.
[152:26.51]Maybe this turtle shell will come in handy.
[152:29.99]No, it's not.
[152:30.61]There's not enough movement I can do.
[152:31.71]I can't move around.
[152:36.25]Where am I supposed to move during this whole thing?
[152:40.40]The movement is very limited.
[152:42.74]Inside here?
[152:43.22]Don't be inside here.
[152:44.50]Is it?
[152:44.72]No, it's not.
[152:45.18]Good.
[152:45.52]I lucked out.
[152:47.06]Oh, no!
[152:49.06]I wasn't paying.
[152:49.68]I fucking just wasn't stuck.
[152:52.69]I got this.
[153:11.75]Here we go, one, two.
[153:16.53]No!
[153:17.75]Oh, no!
[153:31.14]I thought that was an invincibility.
[153:32.52]I thought it was invincibility.
[153:33.86]It wasn't invincibility.
[153:35.00]It doesn't make you invincible.
[153:36.07]I thought it protected you.
[153:41.99]I was trying to... I thought it was going to make me invincible when that happened.
[153:44.47]I was trying to time it so it would make me invincible during the blast and it doesn't work.
[153:49.79]It's okay.
[153:52.14]We got it this time.
[154:00.62]I can't really do anything here.
[154:02.46]Nothing is worth doing.
[154:04.39]You know, actually it might be worth getting rid of... Might be doing two claws here.
[154:10.87]And place the turtle with a claw.
[154:12.21]That's what I'm gonna do.
[154:14.91]That is the plan here.
[154:18.28]And I'm gonna do this.
[154:21.72]I'm ready.
[154:24.32]No frog.
[154:25.10]No frog.
[154:25.46]Frog's not gonna help me here.
[154:26.94]Frog doesn't do any melee damage.
[154:32.10]I'm doing super chicken.
[154:38.84]Shoot eggs in every direction.
[154:40.68]And I got the crab claw.
[154:45.27]I load my DPS.
[154:46.23]It doesn't matter.
[154:49.25]I don't need DPS right now.
[154:50.73]I need focused attacks.
[154:53.11]On the center of that device.
[154:59.12]I don't really give a shit about what happens right here.
[155:02.24]Except I do.
[155:02.82]Except I do.
[155:03.64]I've got...
[155:07.01]Don't get electrocuted.
[155:07.95]Give me that health pack.
[155:10.16]I tried to... Well, I need just a one... Let me just do this, okay?
[155:17.61]I need concentration here.
[155:36.51]I'm just kidding.
[155:37.11]I need to concentrate.
[155:43.10]Watch out for the bomb.
[155:51.10]Dangerous.
[155:52.26]Dangerous.
[155:52.76]Very dangerous.
[155:54.84]Very dangerous.
[155:55.88]Good.
[155:56.66]Goodbye.
[155:57.96]Alright, here we go.
[156:02.45]I just need to get a focus here.
[156:04.15]He does the stupid thing where he puts his legs up and then you go underneath his eyeball crotch.
[156:17.44]This is what I want to do.
[156:18.22]Oh my god, what are you, stupid?
[156:23.43]Yeah, I'm fine.
[156:30.85]It's a question of just getting in and getting out.
[156:32.21]I'm gonna give myself one swing.
[156:34.57]When the leg opens, just get out.
[156:35.80]Play it safe.
[156:36.30]Don't be a fucking moron.
[156:37.88]No reason to do that.
[156:41.02]Play it super smart and safe.
[156:42.62]Have to wait for one more cycle.
[156:48.95]There we go.
[156:55.27]Get out from under the leg here.
[156:56.23]Here's the last cycle.
[156:58.33]Play it smart.
[157:00.16]Work smarter, not harder.
[157:06.61]Here comes the next leg.
[157:07.37]We're going to get out of here on this cycle.
[157:19.89]Out.
[157:21.46]Just like that.
[157:23.78]Don't freak it out.
[157:26.36]I might not be able to get over here on this cycle, although maybe I can.
[157:30.56]I can.
[157:31.78]Perfect.
[157:32.65]Here comes phase three.
[157:34.15]Get out of here.
[157:39.31]Don't stay in there for too long.
[157:42.37]Oh, mama.
[157:42.89]I'm going to miss a cycle.
[157:46.68]No, I'm not going in.
[157:48.34]I'm not going under.
[157:49.38]Sorry.
[157:49.66]You're not fooling me, game.
[157:51.26]I'm not getting baited.
[157:51.92]See?
[157:52.68]Would have just got baited there.
[157:57.92]I might...
[157:59.76]Oh shit.
[158:00.73]I'm good.
[158:06.15]Don't play it safe.
[158:06.73]Play it stupid.
[158:07.59]Greed.
[158:08.63]Play it dumb here.
[158:09.33]Get it.
[158:10.43]Greed.
[158:12.50]See?
[158:13.54]Gotta know when to go in and when not to go in.
[158:19.80]There it goes.
[158:20.56]Time to destroy Tokyo Center.
[158:24.07]Whatever this is.
[158:34.67]I would be very upset about that.
[158:40.39]We're good.
[158:45.64]Come on, hurry up.
[158:46.42]Greed wins.
[158:49.32]Greed wins sometimes.
[158:53.46]New little guy.
[158:55.04]Let's see what it is.
[158:59.36]Evolve the electric eel.
[159:00.70]Press both left and right to stun all enemies.
[159:06.09]Alright, give him my little mini-game.
[159:09.07]He's very cute.
[159:09.75]It's a plus.
[159:14.79]I like when they're very cute.
[159:16.49]Little tadpole-looking guy.
[159:24.32]Okay, well, that's how that works.
[159:28.20]Lasts for a very long time.
[159:30.48]That's good.
[159:31.04]I like that.
[159:32.94]It's kind of like taking a freezer without the freeze.
[159:36.46]It's like a penguin without having a penguin on your arm.
[159:39.20]Might be worth using if it comes up.
[159:40.83]Maybe.
[159:46.77]Look at all the shells I have, though.
[159:49.46]Ow.
[159:53.84]We're gonna be all, like, gonna do it with a shopping spree coming up here.
[160:00.37]Which way?
[160:00.71]Left or right?
[160:01.05]What do you think?
[160:02.67]I'm going to say... No.
[160:06.68]Got them all.
[160:12.52]Come on.
[160:16.52]Missed those.
[160:17.88]It's alright.
[160:22.09]Final push.
[160:29.86]Give me those delicious clams.
[160:33.61]Stupid little... That stupid rocket just fucked me up.
[160:40.91]Is it going to hurt me?
[160:45.09]I thought... It's alright, we're done.
[160:48.46]The level's over.
[160:49.24]I don't know who deactivated the explosive device.
[160:56.74]What happened?
[160:58.94]No!
[160:59.04]No!
[161:10.51]Did I miss out on anything?
[161:11.55]Why did I scream?
[161:13.21]That was a stupid scream.
[161:14.41]It was very loud.
[161:15.05]I'm sorry.
[161:15.65]That was a dumb thing to do on stream.
[161:18.17]It's like scream.
[161:19.90]Reveals this cloaked enemies now.
[161:21.36]God damn it.
[161:22.98]That sucks.
[161:27.34]I think I'm going to have to put one of these on, right?
[161:31.85]Let's replace the chicken.
[161:32.67]No, let's replace the shitty claw.
[161:39.58]That's better.
[161:40.06]I feel like we're going to have to have that now.
[161:48.72]Here's the thing.
[161:49.74]Let's let the funny YouTube video play out.
[161:51.46]Hold on.
[161:51.64]How is he there?
[162:12.68]It's gonna go to the, yeah, the dolphin.
[162:15.04]Didn't even break the screen.
[162:24.15]Uh, destroy the Eiffel Tower in France.
[162:33.20]Eiffel Tower.
[162:35.18]Sure thing.
[162:37.70]Uh, what was, what was I just saying?
[162:39.84]I was saying words and I don't remember, oh yeah, okay, cloaked enemies.
[162:43.98]Yeah, so you do need this thing.
[162:46.72]So hold on.
[162:47.06]Wait, wait, wait.
[162:47.36]What's going on here?
[162:49.26]I'm confused.
[162:49.94]So if I don't have this, I cannot beat this level.
[162:53.66]And it's only if you shoot it in a very precise direction.
[162:57.75]Oh, boy.
[163:00.55]Oh, I don't like this.
[163:03.23]He doesn't have a weapon either.
[163:04.29]He just has a bright light on his face.
[163:13.29]That sucks.
[163:14.13]It's going to end up being enemies that are very hard to kill too, eventually.
[163:25.00]No, I don't want to use this.
[163:26.92]That was close.
[163:37.95]Didn't see that one.
[163:42.08]I may as well spin in a goddamn circle.
[163:48.88]Oh, that hurts.
[163:51.77]This is only going to get more difficult.
[163:54.15]A huge wave of enemies is approaching.
[163:55.75]Yes, they are.
[164:03.27]You kind of just have to... I can just spin it around and hopefully I can get enough hits on them.
[164:10.69]Sorry, that's not happening.
[164:12.47]I ain't losing that.
[164:17.60]Dear, oh dear.
[164:23.14]I'll try spinning.
[164:23.82]That's a cool trick.
[164:33.05]I think it might be time for another chicken to go away.
[164:37.09]Because this is another rare here.
[164:40.90]I wonder if it should be a bee or a chicken.
[164:43.85]Maybe the bee.
[164:44.31]Is it going to be this guy or this guy?
[164:52.83]I'm not sure which one.
[164:54.05]Probably the bee.
[165:02.70]Although these being right next to each other like that, I don't know if I want that.
[165:08.20]Yeah, I don't want them that close, because otherwise it's kind of... They aim and... I'd rather be able to have one shooting up and one shooting right.
[165:14.59]Or left, whatever, you know?
[165:16.23]90 degrees.
[165:17.87]The bee is... The bee can just auto-aim.
[165:19.57]It's fine.
[165:19.93]It doesn't bother me.
[165:26.70]I guess I could have put an angler here, but... You know.
[165:31.78]Replace the claw.
[165:32.44]I feel like I'm going to need the claw when we get to the...
[165:36.74]These things... Okay, look.
[165:37.60]They're not even close to me to destroy them now.
[165:44.44]Let's see.
[165:50.60]Any more cloaks?
[165:52.46]Well, of course.
[165:53.26]Jesus Christ.
[165:58.51]Alright, it worked out.
[166:03.43]Worked out in our favor, we're good.
[166:06.61]Just gonna do the prices right.
[166:08.83]You landed on a letter.
[166:11.90]Noise.
[166:13.46]And we're gonna be fine.
[166:14.20]Uh, yeah, are there any S's?
[166:22.36]Yes, there are two S's.
[166:25.02]Good thing I made that joke.
[166:25.92]No, there are four S's.
[166:28.88]Fuck.
[166:33.46]It's not even... It's quiet, Jeremy, please.
[166:38.00]There's no reason to be talking.
[166:40.08]Yes, there is.
[166:40.70]I'm like streaming.
[166:42.66]No, no, no more talking, Jeremy.
[166:45.24]Why are you doing that?
[166:47.74]You're only broadcasting yourself right now.
[166:50.00]Stop talking.
[166:50.82]Huge wave.
[167:00.24]That's not the prices, right?
[167:02.80]Not the wheel of fortune.
[167:04.59]Whatever.
[167:06.39]You know the thing I was trying to talk about.
[167:07.91]Price is right is not, yes, Wheel of Fortune.
[167:18.62]Streamer goes insane and argues with himself on stream.
[167:20.82]I tend to do that.
[167:22.66]I have conflicting opinions.
[167:24.68]Oh, and we got three Cobras, baby.
[167:28.50]Yeah, uh, yeah, um, yeah.
[167:32.88]And we'll get an Angler.
[167:33.88]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[167:39.08]Do I do another Angler for the bee?
[167:42.28]Or should I do an Angler over here instead of Claw?
[167:47.91]I think so.
[167:55.87]Don't need the Angler, but... I mean... Wait, what do you mean don't need?
[167:58.41]What do you mean no Angler?
[167:59.59]No Angler.
[168:00.05]Everyone's saying no Angler.
[168:03.92]What if I have... What if I'm being surrounded by enemies?
[168:11.20]Angler is utility.
[168:12.07]Yeah, let's keep him then.
[168:16.57]Why would I want another Angler?
[168:17.57]So we can, like, spin in one quarter of our span.
[168:19.93]We can reveal the whole map instead of spinning all the way around in a circle.
[168:27.32]You just spin.
[168:28.16]Look, look, look.
[168:29.52]Never question me, okay?
[168:38.00]Never.
[168:46.62]Safe, safe, safe, safe, safe.
[168:47.84]Come on, be safe.
[168:48.58]Be safe!
[168:53.08]Dictator streamer.
[168:55.08]Don't ever question me, okay?
[169:00.64]I get that enough at Burger King.
[169:03.38]As the district manager.
[169:05.32]Oh, you fucked up my order.
[169:07.30]I wanted lettuce and tomato on this, not barbecue sauce.
[169:10.08]Don't fucking talk.
[169:10.75]Don't question me, okay?
[169:13.29]When you come into my drive-thru, I'm sorry, but the way it is, I'm just going to randomly put a sandwich together.
[169:17.97]I don't even care if it's what you ordered.
[169:19.55]Don't ever question... Look, I know exactly what you want to eat for food, okay?
[169:24.90]Don't ever question me.
[169:27.46]They drive away.
[169:31.36]Yeah, I have a one-star rating on my Burger King.
[169:34.22]You've got to give a shit about quality.
[169:40.17]What does this guy do?
[169:42.73]What are you doing?
[169:45.67]Okay, he shoots the under-the-chin move.
[169:52.21]Oh, he does a lot of those.
[169:58.26]Alright, eventually something will kill him.
[170:04.32]Oh boy, this is tough.
[170:05.50]Whoa.
[170:07.40]Just barely.
[170:07.92]Let's go ahead and do some damage here.
[170:14.60]That's a bigger cannon.
[170:15.94]What does that thing do?
[170:18.00]Oh god.
[170:18.54]Oh, they're stealthed.
[170:21.50]Somebody get him, please.
[170:23.63]I'm just gonna do this.
[170:24.29]I'm gonna spin around his circle the whole time.
[170:26.87]No, that's not worth it.
[170:28.75]They're not that dangerous.
[170:35.59]Oh shit.
[170:46.16]Is he hitting him?
[170:47.38]No, he is.
[170:53.90]B, come on.
[170:58.32]Come on!
[171:02.06]Oh no, here comes the last phase.
[171:03.17]What is he going to do?
[171:05.27]What is that?
[171:05.77]What are you doing?
[171:07.29]How do I dodge this?
[171:07.99]What do I do about this?
[171:13.37]I don't know.
[171:13.83]Just attack him, please.
[171:17.62]What does this do?
[171:18.26]What's he doing?
[171:18.98]Which way?
[171:22.02]Why do I need to be scared of this?
[171:24.26]He's not... Oh!
[171:25.33]Okay, he's getting in closer.
[171:26.55]I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[171:31.07]Please die from this.
[171:32.11]Please die!
[171:32.79]Ugh!
[171:38.58]Wah!
[171:42.46]Ugh, okay.
[171:45.57]I don't know why I'm scared of this.
[171:49.56]I'm scared.
[171:50.60]NA aim.
[171:51.50]Give me a break.
[171:52.06]There's a chainsaw in front of me.
[171:54.78]Don't treat me like that.
[171:56.16]Don't come to my fucking Burger King and treat me like that.
[172:03.99]I had to do it.
[172:17.45]At least we're on land.
[172:21.25]We're in France.
[172:24.39]Now I got a lot of damage shooting in every direction.
[172:29.53]Here's the stealth mechanic.
[172:31.16]Oh, I can't wait for this.
[172:37.70]Why is it France that's stealth?
[172:44.20]Isn't America the country with the stealth, like, B-2 bomber?
[172:47.98]Who has the stealth country?
[172:53.87]Oh, this is not going to be good.
[173:02.57]Watch out for that dumb shark.
[173:04.27]I only have one hit.
[173:05.04]We're going to... Look, we need to die anyways here.
[173:07.98]There's a lot of shells to spend.
[173:09.16]We have to get another shortcut.
[173:10.30]There's all kinds of shit going on.
[173:12.90]I need to upgrade the monster here.
[173:17.94]Okay, so it goes through the stealth.
[173:19.07]That's good.
[173:21.45]That is good to know.
[173:30.71]Swap flies.
[173:31.99]Good.
[173:33.17]No shortcuts.
[173:33.90]Yes, there are shortcuts.
[173:35.50]It's in the game.
[173:35.94]We're supposed to get them every time.
[173:39.08]Oh, shit.
[173:44.86]That was close.
[173:48.91]Oh, fuck, they're right here.
[173:50.11]Oh my god, they're close.
[173:51.47]Watch out.
[173:51.97]Come on, crab claw them.
[174:02.22]Hurry up.
[174:07.42]I gotta keep moving, otherwise I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble here.
[174:11.31]That was a mistake.
[174:12.45]I just panicked.
[174:13.33]I just had a... I panicked.
[174:15.55]That's all that happened.
[174:20.17]There's no other explanation to why I just did that.
[174:22.09]It was a panic.
[174:22.87]There we go.
[174:39.21]They're getting closer.
[174:40.07]Don't let them get that far in, please.
[174:44.06]Shit.
[174:44.46]I gotta get the guys shooting in all these directions.
[174:46.06]Get all three of them.
[174:46.62]Thank you.
[174:53.33]Whoa, watch out.
[174:57.69]Oh, I can't say I'm confident in my ability right here.
[175:01.93]Too many things going on.
[175:05.52]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[175:08.82]I wasn't about to deal with that.
[175:11.40]I gotta be damn sure.
[175:15.66]I'm dead.
[175:16.12]Okay, it's alright.
[175:16.72]You know, whatever.
[175:17.37]I want to spend my money.
[175:18.89]Paris won.
[175:22.36]I got a lot of money.
[175:28.83]Black Mamba DNA shoots venom insanely fast.
[175:34.91]So many of these are so cool.
[175:36.83]Okay, look, I'm going to get five hearts here.
[175:42.03]Should I get the insane fast thing?
[175:43.95]Yep.
[175:44.63]I have to.
[175:47.29]We have to go all the way down that tree and I get my other health pool.
[175:52.16]now um okay should I start with three I can do both of these right let's start with three lives and let's get the extra slot and might as well get the coral DNA because this is just an upgraded version of the of the shell can't afford anything else so we have the insane what is the pelican swallows enemies whole we'll get it eventually
[176:19.89]Don't have enough to get another heart.
[176:23.53]Cool.
[176:25.55]Alright.
[176:27.17]The shortcut has only taken us to America 4.
[176:30.70]Let me just pee.
[176:31.18]I'll be right back.
[176:31.60]I'm gonna pee real quick.
[176:32.66]We'll do another run or two.
[176:33.44]Let me just pee.
[177:10.84]Song Ge Dong Ge Dao.
[177:58.78]So they don't want to see.
[178:49.72]Alright, so.
[178:50.24]Let's come back here.
[178:53.12]Alright, let's talk about the game.
[178:58.81]Let me give some of my first impressions after three hours.
[179:00.75]I don't have any complaints at all.
[179:05.65]None.
[179:07.95]I mean, like, absolutely no complaints at all.
[179:10.84]Zero.
[179:11.98]This game's great.
[179:13.12]Very good.
[179:19.30]Uh, somebody gave 50 bucks.
[179:20.64]Hold on.
[179:20.90]Yeah, I thought I hated PopCap.
[179:24.26]This is not PopCap.
[179:26.68]This is the guy that is responsible for all the great shit that PopCap did.
[179:31.75]He went on to make this game.
[179:35.89]This is not a PopCap game.
[179:37.71]This is a George fan game.
[179:43.20]It's a perfect score!
[179:44.42]No.
[179:47.50]I didn't get paid big money to play.
[179:48.98]I didn't get paid any money to play this.
[179:54.23]Yeah, so if you liked old PopCap, this is old PopCap.
[179:58.25]This is Plants vs. Zombies 1.
[180:00.59]Insane Aquarium.
[180:02.61]This is just that.
[180:03.85]It's that.
[180:04.57]If you like that, you'll like this.
[180:06.05]Game's fucking $12.
[180:06.59]Peggle 1.
[180:17.20]selling out selling out I'm selling out to the devil gotta drop the script uh no but let's let's be really clear here we're skipping this how much are they paying you to sell uh no okay here's what happened uh George fan me and him like just talked randomly what for like five seconds
[180:47.31]And he's like, hey, my game's coming out.
[180:48.89]You want to play it?
[180:49.63]And I was like, yeah, I already was going to play it.
[180:52.52]That's it.
[180:54.92]And then we exchanged personal cell phone numbers.
[181:03.21]Let's go with crab.
[181:06.91]And let's get the eel right off the bat.
[181:14.90]He's in the chat, is he?
[181:18.60]Oh, shit.
[181:19.68]Well, he didn't give me his cell phone number.
[181:21.42]I'm gonna call him on stream.
[181:25.18]That didn't happen.
[181:34.27]No, look, don't you guys know how the rules work these days?
[181:38.39]If I was paid to play a game, I have to tell you that I was paid to play it.
[181:45.71]That's how this works.
[181:46.35]It's against the law now.
[181:48.27]You understand that, right?
[181:51.19]If I get paid like five grand to play this game, you guys have to know that.
[181:55.32]Don't you understand?
[181:55.84]This is just a fucking awesome game by a passionate developer.
[182:02.14]Who you should continue to support because they make great content.
[182:04.98]That's all it is.
[182:12.04]It was against the law.
[182:13.70]It was against the law before too, apparently.
[182:18.09]So what you're saying is that you're a lawbreaker.
[182:24.73]No, let's be real here.
[182:25.84]Let's be real serious.
[182:30.72]You're gonna like this game if you buy it.
[182:32.08]That's it.
[182:33.12]Nobody paid me to say that.
[182:35.92]Stop!
[182:36.66]People get it.
[182:37.62]They know.
[182:42.30]Two whole Bitcoins.
[182:45.92]Hey, George, thanks for the Bitcoins.
[182:50.52]I want to see what this does.
[182:53.45]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[182:54.41]Just kind of freezes everybody and that's cool.
[183:03.45]Stop breaking the law, dude.
[183:08.41]I'm being serious.
[183:09.23]You're going to jail.
[183:15.58]Give me one of the new ones, dude.
[183:18.61]I don't think I want any of this.
[183:19.81]Maybe a chicken.
[183:22.47]No, just two claws.
[183:29.81]Yeah, two bitcoins would be fucking crazy.
[183:32.24]That'd be like $17,000.
[183:33.28]That would be an outrageous amount of money.
[183:40.08]No, no chicken yet.
[183:43.04]Bad placement?
[183:43.84]No, it's good placement.
[183:52.05]I do like the progression kind of rogue-lite.
[183:56.48]Where you kind of have to start over and learn everything again.
[183:58.82]I'm sentenced to life in prison.
[184:09.58]Well, there's the dumb health that I lost for no reason.
[184:15.68]Keep going.
[184:18.96]You've been gone for three hours, how am I on the first level?
[184:21.18]Because this game is a rogue-like kind of game where I have to go back and redo everything again when I die, but I get permanent upgrades.
[184:32.62]And unlock more animals to use.
[184:39.20]What's the exchange rate for bald coin to Jerma Bucks?
[184:46.00]Stay right there.
[184:48.42]There is no conversion.
[184:51.35]Not yet, at least.
[184:53.23]There never will be.
[184:53.87]He's still on New York.
[184:56.63]This guy sucks.
[185:03.77]You must be pretty bad if you're stuck on the first level still.
[185:07.82]Come on!
[185:08.32]Alright, we've heard that before.
[185:10.18]What about the seashells?
[185:25.64]Time me out?
[185:26.32]Why?
[185:26.62]What did I do?
[185:31.23]Come on, leave my city alone, dude.
[185:35.51]Alright, here we go.
[185:36.05]I don't need the angler.
[185:38.49]Um... That thing's not... Let's get another tentacle.
[185:44.86]And let's put a chicken right in the middle.
[185:47.88]Sounds good to me.
[185:49.54]Look at how much of a pro I am now.
[185:50.94]I'm just like, quick, quick, bang, bang, bang.
[185:52.48]Getting stuff put in place.
[185:55.21]Remember I was sitting on that menu for like a minute straight?
[185:58.34]Not anymore.
[185:59.68]God, have I improved.
[186:07.06]We can pause this too.
[186:07.94]That's cool.
[186:18.01]I like this game.
[186:18.89]I do.
[186:20.13]In fact, I really like this game.
[186:24.55]George, you've done it again.
[186:26.13]He's done it again.
[186:31.56]Come back.
[186:33.16]Don't get hit.
[186:33.60]Don't get... Don't, don't, don't.
[186:42.14]He's done it again.
[186:42.96]They said he couldn't do it again.
[186:45.91]No, no, no, no, no.
[186:55.61]Don't step on any of the landmines.
[187:01.55]Woo!
[187:04.58]HalfpennyPencilStreamer.
[187:09.44]Look, we're all making these jokes right now, but come on, give me the real story.
[187:14.53]Give me the real story.
[187:15.43]I don't wanna be fake news bullshit, right?
[187:18.37]That's a hot topic, like fake news, right?
[187:20.73]Don't give me the fake news.
[187:24.81]What do you think about this game so far?
[187:26.75]Really?
[187:26.97]I want you to be honest with me.
[187:31.50]It doesn't freeze him very long.
[187:38.69]This is pretty good, don't it?
[187:43.94]McDonald's cures... Alright.
[187:45.80]I don't care about McDonald's curing baldness anymore, guys.
[187:49.19]Stop telling me that McDonald's cure... I'm looking at the chat and I keep reading that McDonald's fries cure baldness.
[187:55.94]I'm not gonna go to the doctor and get prescribed McDonald's fries.
[187:58.58]That's not gonna happen.
[188:10.52]Hey Jeremy, did you know that you're bald now?
[188:12.52]And you bald-ass head and eat McDonald's fries, you bald fuck.
[188:21.96]I'm not even gonna say it.
[188:23.59]Doesn't even matter.
[188:30.19]So does staying hydrated.
[188:31.49]Are we still on that too?
[188:33.25]I thought we were gonna get the fuck over that.
[188:43.02]That worked out perfectly.
[188:44.32]Uh, that was a bad move.
[188:55.31]I'm not gonna get hit by it, though.
[188:57.51]And he's gonna die in three, two, one.
[189:00.81]Three, two, one.
[189:03.78]Got it.
[189:04.02]Mm-hmm.
[189:10.01]Kaboom.
[189:11.29]Now we destroy the Statue of Liberty.
[189:18.04]I'm gonna have a Mic Water.
[189:22.00]Whatever that means.
[189:28.74]Just use it whenever you can.
[189:30.57]No reason to hold onto it this early.
[189:36.23]Down she goes.
[189:45.04]Nice.
[189:45.46]36 shells.
[189:47.12]One for every year I've been born.
[189:48.64]Let me try to get them all.
[189:57.77]I have not gotten every single one.
[189:58.89]Maybe you get a bonus if you do it.
[190:02.43]Hard to predict where they're going to be, though.
[190:07.38]Nope.
[190:09.36]Actually, I don't think there's a way to get that unless you use... that.
[190:14.74]Well, we really missed out on getting them all.
[190:20.37]You were born 36 times.
[190:22.35]Yeah!
[190:24.79]I told you, there's a lot of me's.
[190:27.74]I'm not talking M-I-I, I'm talking M-E.
[190:49.26]Which one of them am I?
[190:50.10]I'm 31.
[190:51.05]Okay, every year, one of us gets drop kicked down a well, and then the other one walks in.
[191:03.24]This has been going on for 31 years.
[191:17.23]And every time, it's gonna happen to me, and I'm not gonna see it coming.
[191:20.36]What they do is they... The powers that be call you into...
[191:26.38]They call you into the field, and they promise you, they say, hey, we're going to go for a trip, we're going to go to ice cream.
[191:31.74]And you're like, oh, ice cream!
[191:32.72]Oh, I love ice cream!
[191:33.40]I love ice cream, so it's very hard for me to resist this.
[191:36.63]And they say to stand right in front of the well if you want the ice cream.
[191:41.41]And stupidly enough, we all believe it.
[191:43.81]We all stand right in front of the well, even though I know it's going to happen.
[191:46.61]I just want that ice cream so bad, because it's a chocolate swirl.
[191:50.31]They hand you the ice cream.
[191:51.47]They give you at least two bites to enjoy it.
[191:54.13]And then two fucking Nike sneakers go directly into your chest and we go down the well.
[192:00.03]And then we start eating each other down there, from my understanding.
[192:02.65]There's radios inside there.
[192:04.93]Because the sick fucks that are in power just love to listen to us kill each other and eat each other and stuff.
[192:09.73]So, I think there's like nine people left down there.
[192:13.40]So that's what I get to look forward to.
[192:14.68]In about three months now, I think.
[192:18.12]Four months.
[192:25.56]I'm gonna get the X. No, I want the lobster.
[192:27.20]Stronger lobster claw here.
[192:29.28]And I'm gonna put a B. I'm gonna put a B over here.
[192:35.69]I like that.
[192:40.37]And it's funny because I think there actually is a way to get out.
[192:43.21]There's one brick that's soft.
[192:46.47]But here's the problem, right?
[192:47.47]There's a soft brick that leads into the underground.
[192:51.74]But when you put a bunch of us down there... Oh my god, this cloaked enemies!
[192:58.32]That's not good.
[192:58.83]That's really bad.
[193:00.11]They come this early?
[193:00.85]What?
[193:03.43]Oh no.
[193:05.65]Okay.
[193:06.01]Shit.
[193:09.50]Shit.
[193:11.57]But what happens is, remember, there's no food down there, right?
[193:13.97]So there's always at least, think about the amount of time that goes by.
[193:17.27]There's always at least two people that have been down there for at least like six months.
[193:22.26]So there's always going to be somebody really, really hungry.
[193:25.04]So you can't get that person to work together with the rest of us because there's always going to be one person that's so hungry they're willing to eat you alive.
[193:33.64]So it's like, hey, there's a soft brick, let's work together.
[193:35.71]I forget, there's a guy who's already been down here for like three months.
[193:38.59]Like six months, potentially.
[193:40.80]So he's not going to want to listen to us.
[193:42.68]He's trying to tear our flesh off.
[193:45.42]And then it's just a never-ending cycle because then like six months later, that guy that was already here for six months is going to get to that point where he's that hungry.
[193:54.39]It never happens.
[193:59.83]Eventually, what we decided, like, when I get down there, what I think I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a proposition that we should just eat the guy that's been there the longest, so then he won't get hungry enough to eat, like, the rest of us.
[194:10.63]So we're gonna have to do, like, a tally, like, how long have you been down here?
[194:13.59]If you've been down here for more than two years, we eat you.
[194:16.69]Because we're the ones that have been here for the shortest amount of time.
[194:18.81]And then get the spoon that's down there, just one spoon, and take that brick out.
[194:24.63]I'm prepared for that.
[194:34.75]Let's get a cobra.
[194:36.93]No, I need an angler.
[194:38.35]Can you re-roll?
[194:39.29]No.
[194:41.84]Let's get a good cobra on that.
[194:46.10]And an extra life.
[194:47.54]Fuck it, I want one.
[194:57.31]I'm okay with this so far.
[195:02.71]I think it would be pretty easy to get out of the wall.
[195:05.42]This is bad.
[195:12.10]The Cobra has to be ready to shoot.
[195:13.30]Whenever they get up close.
[195:15.52]And then whenever an Angler comes in, they have to get in there now.
[195:20.14]Got the health, that's good.
[195:28.58]The one thing that sucks, though, is I've never eaten a person.
[195:30.78]You know what I mean?
[195:31.50]I don't want to do that.
[195:32.94]I want to get out of the well.
[195:37.17]But I feel like every single one of us has said this over the last 30 years.
[195:41.31]Right?
[195:42.45]No, I don't want to eat anybody.
[195:43.57]I want to get out of the well.
[195:46.01]They probably all said this.
[195:49.76]Your world completely changes when you go down there.
[195:58.14]That was necessary to do that.
[196:04.58]You know what sucks?
[196:11.35]I don't know what it's like!
[196:27.26]Got a good setup for these.
[196:30.43]Don't.
[196:33.73]Alright, please give me an angler so I can replace one of the chickens.
[196:42.94]Angler.
[196:44.40]Shit.
[196:46.20]This is not good.
[196:48.45]Mm.
[196:52.70]I don't think I need to buy anything here.
[196:54.58]This is gonna be... Maybe another bee on... No.
[196:58.88]Yeah, I'm gonna do another.
[196:59.64]I'm gonna replace one of these chickens with a cobra.
[197:08.58]Save money.
[197:10.12]Yeah, but I really need to be able to do damage too, though.
[197:14.97]Thankfully, the only ones that have been cloaked are these stupid enemies.
[197:18.87]They die in one hit, so I can at least be on top of it.
[197:22.07]I can be progressive with it.
[197:26.31]I can win the progressive jackpot.
[197:28.31]You know, if I go to the jackpot, this one's a progressive jackpot.
[197:31.83]So if I sit here all day and I spend $400, I might hit the progressive.
[197:37.54]I just have to spend $5,000 on it.
[197:38.50]It's possible.
[197:48.92]Here comes the large enemy.
[197:52.88]Enemy shields analyzed.
[197:57.39]Get this fucking guy off me!
[198:02.91]Can I freeze him?
[198:09.31]I can't.
[198:10.43]Oh, that doesn't do anything.
[198:12.08]That barely stuns him.
[198:18.14]Get the chicken away from that, please.
[198:19.82]Don't!
[198:20.18]You idiot.
[198:21.36]You idiot.
[198:23.40]You idiot!
[198:30.54]The smaller they get, the faster they go and they need to be taken care of immediately.
[198:40.78]Come on!
[198:41.30]You idiot!
[198:47.09]Easy peasy.
[198:48.92]We're fine.
[198:54.90]Dude, can't... That's not alright.
[198:58.76]That's not alright!
[199:03.34]I tried so hard.
[199:04.00]I am trying pretty hard right here.
[199:05.80]But that thing is the bane of my existence.
[199:10.34]Huh.
[199:12.10]Pretty terrible rolls so far, man.
[199:16.86]No angler.
[199:18.40]There's a frog.
[199:19.50]And there's a shell.
[199:22.44]Hmm.
[199:25.38]Sweat check?
[199:26.02]Well, I have no shirt on, so... It's just going right down my back.
[199:30.14]That's disgusting.
[199:36.03]I'm gonna go with frog.
[199:36.85]We'll replace... Maybe the... No, we're not doing anything.
[199:58.70]Wait, oh, it's been like a couple years, I gotta give you a new hit sound!
[200:16.51]Ow!
[200:17.11]Did that- I'm sorry, did that hurt?
[200:18.27]Hold on, I gotta give you guys a- hold on, wait, wait.
[200:23.38]I gotta give you like a- with clean audio, I gotta do clean audio.
[200:32.70]Hey, I got you clean audio.
[200:33.46]In case you want something different.
[200:46.14]Cover all your bases there.
[200:53.69]Is anybody still ahead?
[200:54.75]That's such an old hit sound.
[201:01.09]What the fuck was that?
[201:03.67]The second one might actually be good.
[201:05.17]No, wait, wait.
[201:18.74]Why am I doing this?
[201:28.85]Try again.
[201:29.29]That was a good one.
[201:35.26]One more?
[201:39.10]I think that's a good one right there.
[201:40.62]That's a classic Call of Duty hit sound.
[201:43.92]I mean, that game sucks, but the hit sound is great.
[201:45.76]Let's be real.
[201:51.28]There's one thing that you can say, you can't talk shit about Call of Duty's hit sound.
[201:55.22]Everything else about that entire series is garbage, except for that.
[202:05.01]That's not true.
[202:05.61]I mean, Call of Duty Modern Warfare was good.
[202:07.82]It was alright.
[202:08.64]Black Ops was kind of fun.
[202:11.10]Every other video game that they've ever made in the last, like, seven years has been the worst game I've ever seen.
[202:23.11]I can't hit any no-scopes.
[202:25.93]Yeah.
[202:27.01]I know.
[202:30.53]This whole argument's out of jealousy.
[202:36.14]He's backtracking.
[202:37.80]Look, you have to backtrack because somebody gets really angry.
[202:40.45]Look, if you don't, don't you know and understand like politics and social interaction 101?
[202:45.19]If you say something that you know is going to really piss off a ton of people, backtrace it, reiterate, and say it's my opinion, but it's not, there were some good things that came from that series.
[202:55.74]Backtrack, backtrace it, and then put some basset tracing all over it.
[203:04.22]You guys know my true feelings, but that's my Bacitracin.
[203:08.78]Wait.
[203:09.92]Yeah.
[203:10.08]Let's put this one here.
[203:13.93]I got it.
[203:19.13]Spineless.
[203:20.05]Is it spineless or is it intelligent?
[203:21.79]Is it smart?
[203:26.22]Is it intelligent to say that?
[203:35.17]drink please drink on stream what are you talking about spineless no that's just the snippet that plays in the news don't you know like the the thing that the clip that plays on TV is not the thing that the guy actually wants you to hear right
[203:58.21]Oh, Senator Jones said today that he's very excited and he's very much totally on board and respects the decision of Senator Jacobs.
[204:11.70]But behind closed doors, Senator Jones is like, this guy sucks.
[204:15.62]This policy sucks.
[204:17.01]Let's try to run him out of office.
[204:19.17]That's just the blurb that they wrote in the newspaper.
[204:26.71]All it is is just trying to underhandedly work against all of your colleagues until you get to be the highest position of power.
[204:32.75]Haven't you guys seen Mad Men?
[204:34.97]That's the whole story behind Mad Men.
[204:36.75]I just spoiled the whole show.
[204:37.77]It's a bunch of rich guys that want to try to get as far as they can as fast as they can without pissing off as many people as they possibly could.
[204:48.60]You get me?
[204:49.12]You know, if I was a senator, oh my god, I would fucking rule that place.
[204:55.08]I would run the show if I became a senator, and you guys all know that.
[204:59.26]I would make sound policy.
[205:02.13]Based on fundamental principles.
[205:04.81]And I would woo every single other senator.
[205:06.59]All the lobbyists.
[205:07.39]I would be like, get these fucking lobbyists out of here.
[205:09.23]I'll be the lobbyist.
[205:10.03]I'll be the only lobbyist.
[205:13.77]I'll be one of those guys that... Here's the floor for you, Mr. Jeremy.
[205:18.52]And I'll talk way over my time limit like everybody does.
[205:25.24]Now remember, every single one of y'all gets two minutes for the floor, and then that's it.
[205:29.96]We're gonna move on to the next senator.
[205:31.80]That never happens.
[205:33.14]The guy always talks over his time.
[205:35.04]Every single fucking time.
[205:37.21]Okay, that's enough, senator!
[205:39.05]And he's gonna start banging his hand on the desk, and they all do it.
[205:41.53]They all think they're fucking cool.
[205:42.51]They all think, oh, look at how passionate I am.
[205:44.23]I'm going over my time limit.
[205:46.45]No, just go do your time limit and fucking shut up and go move on.
[205:55.40]There should be no time limit because it never happens.
[206:01.07]Just filibuster everything.
[206:04.71]And I would wear a Mega Man costume to work every day.
[206:08.39]Hold on a second here.
[206:09.53]You think it's going to be like a fucking joke?
[206:13.18]No, a full $16,000 Mega Man costume that has real steel and shit made out of it.
[206:17.38]And the helmet.
[206:21.04]Not going to be like a Halloween costume.
[206:26.55]And I'm going to end every single one of my hearings by like holding up the buster and being like, bang, bang, bang.
[206:33.39]And like dancing around, like jumping around like, it's me, Mega Man.
[206:40.42]And everyone's going to think I'm like a weirdo.
[206:42.00]Like I'm just doing like a Mega Man like dance.
[206:48.88]Like I aim it to the sky and I'm like, yeah.
[207:04.79]Mentally unfit for office.
[207:06.91]That's what I'm laughing at.
[207:12.37]Mentally unfit for office.
[207:19.67]And I would like grab the mic wicked hard at the end, you know, like I would be done with my speech and it would be like...
[207:24.59]Like that wicked loud, awful, and I'd be like, yeah, I'd get right in and be like, and that's why we're going to put this bill forth.
[207:31.09]Mega Man out.
[207:31.85]And I would fucking like just put my hands in the air and do like the DX like on my crotch thing.
[207:38.06]You don't think I would get voted for every time?
[207:42.08]Dude, my policy could be like shutting down all public schools and I would get voted for every time.
[207:48.48]My policy could be like food is 10 times more expensive now and they would still vote for me.
[207:55.24]Yeah, like, oh, my policy is all food is an extra 90% more money.
[208:00.82]But because I did the Mega Man costume, people would be fucking, like, happy that I was there.
[208:11.71]Alright, let's go with, uh... We're gonna save.
[208:14.17]We're gonna save money.
[208:19.51]Everyone has to play... Yeah, every TV would have to... Every TV would have to have Mega Man playing on it.
[208:31.38]Fucking politics.
[208:33.98]Politics are a joke.
[208:36.94]The shit that we're talking about right now is more serious than the actual... Alright, I just got zapped, so they all get zapped.
[208:43.46]That's only fair.
[208:44.18]Okay, we're talking about policy here.
[208:46.90]I get zapped, everybody has to get zapped.
[208:51.64]Yeah, you came late to class, to gym, everybody's got to run the lap.
[208:56.92]Mm-hmm.
[208:58.72]Except that sucks.
[209:01.32]That's not a good policy.
[209:02.26]That's a bad policy.
[209:07.29]Don't get hit by that.
[209:08.11]Under the chin, please.
[209:17.86]Watch it.
[209:26.06]Fuck Jim.
[209:26.88]I hate Jim too.
[209:27.68]I didn't like Jim either.
[209:30.66]You know why I didn't like gym?
[209:31.62]It wasn't that I didn't like to move around and I didn't like to participate in playing, like, pickle.
[209:37.14]By the way, like, oh yeah, let's play pickle.
[209:40.28]Which is just weird tennis ping pong.
[209:43.88]I mean, now that I think about it, that game was awesome.
[209:45.90]I wish I could play pickle every day.
[209:48.30]But you have to, like, change clothes in gym.
[209:50.33]You have to bring an extra pair of clothes.
[209:53.35]And if you don't, then they get angry with you.
[209:56.34]It's like, dude, I don't want to change my entire wardrobe in the locker room.
[210:00.13]No.
[210:00.73]You guys don't remember Pickle?
[210:07.97]Pickle was crazy.
[210:08.79]It was literally just... It was life-size ping pong.
[210:14.98]They took ping pong and they grew it by 5,000%.
[210:20.84]And now don't make a reference here telling me that that's just tennis.
[210:24.00]No, no, no, no, no.
[210:24.70]You actually use like ping pong paddles.
[210:27.30]And it's like a big ping pong ball.
[210:30.99]Please do your research.
[210:32.43]Don't talk to me like that.
[210:34.05]Do your research.
[210:37.47]Pickleball.
[210:37.99]There it is.
[210:38.39]Pickleball.
[210:44.36]Pickleball is great.
[210:46.48]It's not tennis.
[210:47.54]It's giant ping pong.
[210:50.24]I'm serious, look it up!
[210:57.80]That's not how you play pickleball.
[210:59.12]Yes it is!
[211:00.44]It's giant ping pong.
[211:05.31]Somebody made like a comically oversized midway game version of ping pong.
[211:14.59]And it took off.
[211:22.21]What am I playing?
[211:22.69]This is Octogeddon.
[211:24.98]Game of the year 2018 so far.
[211:27.24]And that's not a joke.
[211:31.78]That's not a joke.
[211:32.60]It's only February.
[211:34.31]Keep that in mind.
[211:35.03]Keep it in mind.
[211:46.00]Pickleball.
[211:52.97]Although, I am really, really excited for the Fuck the Oscars Guys game.
[212:00.09]His game looks... That looks so good.
[212:03.46]I really hope that's my game of the year.
[212:11.08]Dragon Ball Z Fighter, but I don't play fighters.
[212:16.71]Better than Monster Hunter?
[212:18.19]Well, actually, that's true too.
[212:19.31]Monster Hunter did come out.
[212:21.59]Alright, so far your games of the year for 2018 are Pickleball, then Octogeddon, and Monster Hunter together.
[212:32.05]They're both two.
[212:33.92]And then we're hoping that three is gonna be the Fuck the Oscars Guys video game.
[212:44.10]I got them all, nice.
[212:50.09]Well, that doesn't sound like a video game as much as it sounds like a dirty video.
[212:54.97]That you may have stumbled upon somewhere.
[213:00.92]Don't think you should call your video game Pickle Hunter.
[213:05.56]Unless you are on a currently lewd 18 plus website.
[213:15.34]We're good.
[213:19.48]Did I get them all?
[213:20.04]I don't even care if I get hit.
[213:24.22]I want them all.
[213:25.90]I have three chances to get them all.
[213:29.12]Where are we at?
[213:29.56]Come on.
[213:30.78]Let me get them all.
[213:35.71]That's it.
[213:35.91]I got them all, right?
[213:38.07]Congratulations.
[213:38.67]You got them all.
[213:41.15]No.
[213:47.68]Oh!
[213:48.10]That's eight...
[213:49.28]thousand dollars.
[213:50.48]That's what I should have saved.
[213:55.42]That's so good.
[213:57.01]I should have only had two tentacles this whole time and I would have got a black mamba.
[214:03.51]Damn it.
[214:04.51]It's okay.
[214:07.03]Now I actually am going to save though. 8,000.
[214:20.28]Mmm, ding ding ding ding ding.
[214:21.50]I still need an angler.
[214:22.76]I have not had one spawn for me in one of those shuffles.
[214:27.24]Holy shit, I'm gonna lose.
[214:28.36]This is the end.
[214:29.30]I'm gonna lose all three times until I get one.
[214:33.88]I so desperately need an angler.
[214:35.78]I'm not gonna be able to beat this.
[214:36.90]Oh, let's try to clear these.
[214:47.74]Come on, gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme.
[214:54.57]This is no way, man.
[214:59.42]Although when you do electrocute them, they do all appear.
[215:02.58]Out of their cloaks, that's good.
[215:09.46]Fuck the Oscars game?
[215:10.56]Wait, no.
[215:10.88]I thought that was the Escape from Prison co-op game.
[215:15.16]Is that not the same thing I'm talking about?
[215:16.34]Is that not the Fuck the Oscars guy?
[215:23.49]Freeze them right when they come out.
[215:25.20]That's the only chance I really have.
[215:34.98]Double wave?
[215:35.82]What is this?
[215:38.55]What's this RNG horseshit?
[215:40.15]Oh no.
[215:42.41]You're giving me a double wave?
[215:45.57]I wasn't prepared for a double wave.
[215:54.01]I just got saved by the electric eel.
[216:03.41]Got it.
[216:04.13]Perfect.
[216:06.65]Sorry, Hazelight is the studio.
[216:08.41]A Way Out is the game.
[216:09.47]Yeah, there it is.
[216:10.77]For a second I got confused.
[216:11.56]I was like, wait, what?
[216:13.62]A Way Out.
[216:14.08]That game just looks like it's going to be just a perfect video game.
[216:21.74]We'll see.
[216:23.70]I'm very, very intrigued by it.
[216:29.23]So those are my, like, top picks for 2018 so far.
[216:31.73]Monster Hunter, Octogeddon, A Way Out, and... What the hell else is coming out in 2018?
[216:41.66]A World of Warcraft expansion, probably.
[216:43.78]That'll get on the top games of the year for everybody for some reason.
[216:48.02]Shit, I went the wrong way.
[216:52.76]Oh my god.
[216:53.50]Thank goodness.
[216:56.06]Red Dead 2 is coming out.
[216:57.33]Man.
[216:58.29]There's a lot of stuff coming out.
[216:59.55]Mega Man 11.
[217:04.01]Please give me an Angler.
[217:05.41]I need it so bad.
[217:07.93]This is just bad news, man.
[217:11.05]You gotta give me an Angler.
[217:16.14]Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[217:17.12]Oh, that's on the list.
[217:18.14]That game is gonna be awful.
[217:20.99]That's not fair.
[217:22.27]It is though, right?
[217:31.45]I'm gonna get the puffer.
[217:38.39]And hold everything else.
[217:42.23]Red Dead 2 is gonna be shit because it'll be like GTA Online.
[217:45.89]GTA 5 was awesome though.
[217:48.68]GTA Online was a lot more to be desired, but man, GTA V was a phenomenal game.
[217:55.87]So even if the multiplayer is like a piece of crap, it's still the game itself is probably going to be fantastic.
[218:05.65]Until I get an angler, that has to happen every time.
[218:10.73]GTA V is one of the greatest games of this current generation of video gaming.
[218:15.18]It's awesome.
[218:17.55]That game is fucking incredible.
[218:29.26]No PC release for Red Dead, the original one.
[218:32.98]See, that is something I really cannot understand.
[218:36.00]Even years later, you know how many people would buy that if they just ported it to PC?
[218:41.03]Just do the game of the year edition, have the DLC included in the PC release.
[218:45.07]You don't have to do anything.
[218:45.91]You don't have to add anything.
[218:47.96]You're talking about just getting free money to the studio.
[218:54.43]I just... I need an angler so bad.
[218:58.23]Oh, I'm so angry.
[218:59.76]Look at my voice.
[219:01.36]What is this?
[219:02.18]Nuclear wave.
[219:02.76]A bunch of bombs.
[219:09.84]Hopefully none of them are stealthed.
[219:20.34]Get it.
[219:20.82]Come on.
[219:26.86]Angler waste of money.
[219:27.68]No, it's not.
[219:28.90]That's the only reason why I'm getting hit is because I don't have an Angler.
[219:32.55]I'm mad.
[219:34.21]I'm mad at this game.
[219:43.34]Not today.
[219:45.48]That was a huge wave.
[219:53.01]Big wave.
[219:56.13]That's a lot of bullets.
[219:57.08]Which way am I gonna go?
[220:00.22]Like this.
[220:00.58]Shit, which way is that going?
[220:06.00]Ah, that almost hit me.
[220:09.34]What am I gonna do?
[220:11.01]Oh, oh, oh, I'm so angry.
[220:14.29]Sorry.
[220:17.65]Oh, finally, an angler.
[220:19.25]Thank God.
[220:23.99]And we also have a coral.
[220:25.59]We're going to block two hits now.
[220:27.02]That's good.
[220:27.46]What am I going to do?
[220:34.36]You got this.
[220:35.08]Good, good, good.
[220:35.66]Look at the shower cap.
[220:39.26]The shower brain cap.
[220:40.40]That's fine.
[220:41.22]Oh, that's fine.
[220:42.82]Go on.
[220:46.10]Why would you do that?
[220:46.92]Because I want to be able to go and see what I'm... Enemies.
[220:51.30]Now I get the buzz.
[220:53.33]God, now I'm like wicked buzzed.
[220:54.64]Alright, go, please.
[221:05.37]I can't see.
[221:07.27]I can't, I can't see.
[221:08.69]I can't, I can't, I can't see.
[221:14.27]Did you hear him?
[221:14.65]He can't see.
[221:15.49]I can't see.
[221:22.63]Again, come on.
[221:28.13]Make me an old-fashioned, the old-fashioned way.
[221:30.65]Don't make it so sweet this time.
[221:36.22]I don't know.
[221:36.50]Does anybody know what that is?
[221:37.80]Somebody fucking... Wow.
[221:39.20]Wild Omelet.
[221:39.94]Got it.
[221:41.60]Wild Omelet.
[221:42.38]Holy shit.
[221:42.98]You actually got that.
[221:43.92]That's unbelievable.
[221:44.74]I didn't expect anyone to know what the hell I was talking about.
[221:46.36]That's... You get points.
[221:51.01]You get, like, extra points.
[221:58.14]I'm impressed.
[222:01.12]That's from it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.
[222:06.36]Wow.
[222:08.38]Look at that.
[222:08.84]Move out of the way.
[222:15.17]Well, I didn't have to spin around at all, actually.
[222:18.33]Turns out I was in the perfect position.
[222:25.23]The light is distracting me, actually.
[222:37.18]mod him no that's not how it works just because you understand like a classic movie reference doesn't mean you get to be mod in fact you know what in fact you know what no I'm not having any mods no more mods on this channel I'm gonna be modless it's gonna be me only me I'm gonna rule this chat with a fucking iron fist
[223:06.88]No, that's a joke.
[223:08.18]That's a joke.
[223:08.58]We need moderation.
[223:10.20]Everything in moderation.
[223:11.94]That's what Ben Franklin was talking about like 400 years ago.
[223:16.52]All things in moderation.
[223:17.76]He's talking about like, have your Twitch be moderated very well.
[223:21.50]Have a good moderator.
[223:23.28]He was way before his time.
[223:24.23]People think he actually might have been a time traveler.
[223:27.09]And he had a fucking sick Twitch page.
[223:30.01]He was so good at PUBG.
[223:31.51]That's how you can tell he's a good streamer.
[223:37.46]I'm just being a dick.
[223:41.45]Why am I doing this?
[223:46.97]Ah!
[223:50.28]Watch it.
[223:50.68]Watch it.
[223:51.00]Don't get hit by that.
[223:51.90]I got hit by it.
[223:52.58]Two blocks.
[223:53.28]We're good.
[223:53.64]Two blockers.
[223:54.18]Alright.
[224:02.05]Oh, alright.
[224:08.45]Jerma has made very little sense tonight.
[224:12.54]Or, I've made far too much sense.
[224:16.82]Thinking guy, thinking guy pointing to his head, thinking guy pointing to his head.
[224:22.42]What's that meme?
[224:23.08]The guy, mm-hmm, I'm pointing at my head here, mm-hmm.
[224:30.97]Oh shit, you know what else comes out?
[224:33.91]Oh my god, I can't wait.
[224:35.65]Vermintide 2 comes out here in the next, like, month.
[224:44.45]No, not that thinking guy.
[224:45.35]I'm talking about the other thinking guy.
[224:46.70]That thinking guy grabbing the chin is that one.
[224:49.36]Thinking guy pointing to his temple is the other one I'm talking about.
[224:53.06]You guys are doing the wrong thinking guy.
[224:59.48]Ben Franklin.
[225:02.74]Yeah, Vermintide.
[225:03.36]I actually got to see Vermintide at, um... I don't know.
[225:07.39]What convention was that?
[225:08.29]I don't even know.
[225:09.41]It wasn't PAX, was it?
[225:13.72]Where the hell did I go?
[225:15.04]What convention did I go to?
[225:16.16]Is ETH free?
[225:19.22]Where did I see... I actually got to sit there and watch Vermintide 2.
[225:24.76]One of the devs was showing it.
[225:26.87]And we just walked up with Mina Etalyx.
[225:28.25]I don't know where we... I don't know what... Where were we?
[225:32.03]Maybe it was like in the guy's garage.
[225:33.17]I don't even remember.
[225:33.81]It does look really good though.
[225:44.24]There's going to be lots of 2000.
[225:45.48]I can already like predict my games of 2018.
[225:47.04]It's like really funny.
[225:51.51]Alright.
[225:51.99]Let's see.
[225:53.59]I need to concentrate on this.
[225:54.55]Let's talk about.
[225:55.79]Let me make a prediction because it is February.
[225:57.45]Let's talk about this.
[226:01.22]rewind this somebody clip this or somebody remember this and somebody hold on to this because we're going to see where it is if it was right in 2019 okay so my top five games of 2018 let's see where we are Monster Hunter: World Octagon A Way Out Vermintide 2 and Red Dead Redemption 2
[226:29.37]Let's talk about the order.
[226:31.59]A Way Out will be number one.
[226:33.65]Game of the year for me, probably.
[226:34.89]Let's just see where it is.
[226:36.91]Red Dead Redemption 2.
[226:39.77]Monster Hunter: World.
[226:41.96]Octogeddon.
[226:44.06]And The Witcher 3.
[226:45.52]What was the fifth one?
[226:49.72]The Order 1887.
[226:49.94]What was the fifth game?
[226:59.48]Vermintide.
[227:00.18]Oh, no, Vermintide, then Octagon.
[227:02.35]That's your order.
[227:07.23]Then Pickleball.
[227:07.99]Alright, let's just fuck it.
[227:12.04]Let's just go.
[227:15.62]Order 1887.
[227:18.53]Wasn't that game abysmal?
[227:21.16]No, no, no, wait.
[227:21.88]Wasn't the general consensus on that game was that the game was great, it was a fun game, but it was like an hour and 45 minutes long, right?
[227:30.76]That game was like less than three hours long, wasn't it?
[227:32.40]I gotta move here.
[227:37.01]I gotta move.
[227:37.49]I have to make the fucking decision now.
[227:40.97]Oh, no.
[227:44.67]How am I still not hit here?
[227:51.01]Damn it.
[227:51.29]I thought I was going to show you guys some real skill.
[227:55.01]Oh, well.
[227:58.45]Don't get hit again, man.
[228:00.13]I got to get through Tokyo in one without getting hit.
[228:06.28]I don't like the setup I have.
[228:07.16]I need to move some stuff around.
[228:13.64]We got to move around.
[228:16.78]Wow, that was close.
[228:17.46]I almost got hit by that.
[228:18.86]Yeah, electric.
[228:19.56]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[228:23.83]The bee is going to have to go.
[228:25.67]I don't like the bee and the angler.
[228:26.95]I love how I put the angler on.
[228:29.33]And there ain't any more stealth enemies now.
[228:32.91]Nice work there.
[228:39.96]Keep rolling.
[228:40.70]Do you want me to do something entertaining?
[228:45.64]Like what?
[228:46.34]What do you want me to do?
[228:50.00]What would you like me to say?
[228:51.00]You want to say something?
[228:52.26]Oh no, this is bad.
[228:54.14]I can't.
[228:54.54]At least I have my charge here.
[228:55.52]They should just kind of just get over there.
[229:04.20]Yikes.
[229:05.96]Oh lord, I should have saved it.
[229:11.56]Let's back it up a little bit so I get some room.
[229:15.13]Fuck no!
[229:16.11]I knew it was going to happen.
[229:17.27]I saw it though.
[229:17.91]I saw it going in the whole time.
[229:22.31]Finally, something that is worth putting on.
[229:25.81]We're going to replace the Angler.
[229:29.19]And I'm going to put the Frog on where the Penguin is.
[229:36.97]Now we're ready to go.
[229:40.22]Full HP.
[229:42.28]It's time to Raw Head Roll.
[229:45.70]Alright, so, uh, when I- what?
[229:47.24]Never mind.
[229:47.60]I was gonna make a terrible reference.
[229:48.94]I was gonna say, every time I grab somebody with the... with the tongue... No, not even say it, it's awful.
[230:01.17]Just pretend like I never said that.
[230:07.65]I wonder, if that's rapid fire, what is the actual rapid fire like?
[230:18.00]I blew it.
[230:19.29]Except I actually didn't.
[230:20.33]I'm fine.
[230:22.03]It's these little guys.
[230:23.01]The little spinny spaceship things.
[230:24.51]They just really cause me ill.
[230:35.67]Start to focus actually on using the machine gun.
[230:45.96]It's not something I've been doing.
[230:49.52]That's the thing that has all the damage.
[230:50.86]Might as well use it.
[230:53.76]Causing myself too much stress.
[230:54.94]Let's get another big guy.
[231:00.27]Come on.
[231:01.49]Open, open, open, open it, open it, open it, open it!
[231:15.06]B is going away too.
[231:16.74]What just hit me?
[231:17.52]What did it?
[231:18.18]What was it?
[231:19.38]I didn't see it.
[231:19.96]What was it?
[231:34.88]Get them all.
[231:36.78]Alright frog, you're gonna have to make some moves here.
[231:39.34]Nice.
[231:39.50]That was perfect.
[231:41.10]What a great item.
[231:42.50]What an absolutely phenomenal item.
[231:46.87]Just do all frogs.
[231:47.75]Fuck.
[231:54.98]Break the building, forget about everything else.
[231:58.44]Break building.
[232:01.84]And if you break the building, the level completes and you don't have to worry about anything else.
[232:04.76]Good job.
[232:06.06]You did it.
[232:08.36]Frog is amazing.
[232:17.22]Damn it.
[232:28.59]Yeah, I'm doing it.
[232:29.33]Why not?
[232:31.47]Double frogs.
[232:32.31]We'll be able to grab a couple things at the same time.
[232:36.55]We have two more opportunities to use frog here, and then we're gonna replace him.
[232:41.98]Save money.
[232:43.18]Ah, I'm a spender.
[232:45.28]I'm a big spender.
[232:47.83]You know what I mean?
[232:50.04]Everyone's always like, dude, you're spending too much money!
[232:52.24]I'm like, am I?
[232:53.72]Fucking no, I'm not.
[232:54.88]I'll spend it enough.
[233:00.32]I'm really getting concerned about your overspending here, Jeremy.
[233:03.32]Ah, shut up.
[233:04.07]Stupid.
[233:05.93]And then I give like a fucking 60% tip at every restaurant I go to.
[233:11.79]Alright, shut the fuck up.
[233:13.83]I have to do this right.
[233:15.05]I want to see the next level.
[233:17.82]That's a new enemy.
[233:24.93]Let's get frog here.
[233:39.00]Grab with frog.
[233:41.14]Grab with frog.
[233:42.06]Grab!
[233:47.88]Punch!
[233:48.76]Kick!
[233:49.52]Grab!
[233:55.32]What in the name of God keeps happening to me?
[233:57.71]I hate those enemies.
[233:59.75]Those stupid fucking section breaking pieces of shit.
[234:02.87]I hate those things.
[234:03.65]Because you think you get rid of them, but you actually don't.
[234:21.68]Double wave, shit.
[234:22.78]Not good.
[234:24.60]Not good, not good, not good, not good, not good.
[234:27.24]Okay, okay, hold on.
[234:28.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[234:28.80]One, two, three.
[234:43.55]Not this time.
[234:44.11]Good.
[234:47.27]Now here comes a huge wave.
[234:48.37]I just did a double wave.
[234:49.43]Give me a break.
[234:57.47]It's too many waves.
[235:06.36]Nice.
[235:06.82]I'm happy with that so far.
[235:07.92]Keep going.
[235:10.62]Frog's been actually pretty good.
[235:12.20]It's done me well here.
[235:17.55]Forget about the enemies.
[235:18.25]Let's get it down.
[235:24.48]Hooray.
[235:31.33]Mm-hmm.
[235:33.07]So I got one more level here, and then... Oh.
[235:37.26]Yeah.
[235:40.50]Oh, yeah.
[235:48.02]Got rid of the frog.
[235:48.68]We got another one.
[235:49.28]This is good.
[235:49.82]I can aim directly.
[235:51.29]It doesn't matter which way I am.
[235:52.23]I have a good opportunity here.
[235:55.07]I can be in any direction and do good damage to the boss.
[235:59.70]You know?
[236:00.82]Should be good.
[236:05.28]I'm getting surrounded by enemies here.
[236:07.26]Surrounded.
[236:10.12]What?
[236:10.48]I don't understand what keeps fucking... It keeps hitting me from underneath.
[236:14.92]That pisses me off.
[236:16.96]What is hitting me from underneath?
[236:18.00]Is it those stupid spherical parting enemies?
[236:23.25]God, there's like a shitload of them.
[236:24.71]I got like the shitty roll where I have like a thousand of these fucking things to deal with.
[236:34.00]I hate these things.
[236:35.86]I wanna, like, re-roll the level.
[236:39.33]And not the stupid sectioned alien cyborg enemy.
[236:42.55]What is this, Space Invaders?
[236:45.45]Yeah, the crab arm is really just fucking me bad here.
[236:55.48]Keep rolling.
[236:56.34]Just get to the middle section and then I can get to the boss.
[236:58.86]We can be done with this.
[237:05.58]Almost there.
[237:06.12]Get the big guy with the frog.
[237:07.18]I can't.
[237:10.06]Opportunity's gone.
[237:10.69]Son of a bitch.
[237:14.43]Here come these stupid things.
[237:20.17]I'm sorry.
[237:20.51]I had to use it.
[237:21.96]I had to.
[237:28.88]Down it comes.
[237:29.80]Alright.
[237:32.24]Frog lick, swing, attack.
[237:33.82]Got em both.
[237:34.90]Excellent work.
[237:35.82]Good job, Jeremy.
[237:36.56]You deserve a pat on the back.
[237:38.44]Too hard!
[237:40.24]Boss.
[237:41.56]This guy's very easy as long as you take it slow.
[237:45.90]Got plenty of damage.
[237:52.00]He has a lot of health, but it's alright.
[237:59.64]Easy.
[238:01.15]Just keep the fundamentals going.
[238:09.97]Fundamentals!
[238:10.65]I'm gonna use this now, just because.
[238:12.47]It'll recharge by the time I need to use it again.
[238:21.26]Chad is getting wrecked.
[238:22.22]What's going on with Chad?
[238:23.20]What are you guys doing?
[238:25.02]You guys causing problems?
[238:28.00]I'm gonna get baited.
[238:30.67]Oh, God damn it.
[238:36.85]Are you guys breaking rules?
[238:38.25]What rules are you breaking here?
[238:41.47]Don't make me unhappy.
[238:42.67]You guys don't... You're not trying to make me unhappy?
[238:45.87]You wouldn't like me when I'm unhappy.
[238:47.05]Incredible Hulk said that.
[238:54.28]Just treat me like him.
[238:55.62]You would.
[239:00.49]They're using banned memes.
[239:02.09]Oh boy.
[239:04.93]That's a five second ban.
[239:09.80]You guys are going out of control, huh?
[239:17.08]Don't be greedy.
[239:18.62]No reason to be.
[239:26.43]Not in a good position.
[239:27.19]Don't even take it.
[239:27.77]Don't even take it.
[239:28.45]Don't even take it.
[239:28.97]Bad position.
[239:35.34]Don't shoot the blazer.
[239:36.08]Right.
[239:36.30]Is he going to... I might take a hit here.
[239:39.82]Yeah, I'm going to take a... No, I'm not.
[239:40.76]Don't take an unnecessary hit for no reason.
[239:44.69]I'm going to take this hit.
[239:45.93]Yes, I am.
[239:47.51]Just kidding.
[239:47.97]You think I'm that dumb?
[239:48.65]You think I've ever played a game before?
[239:51.69]Come on, man.
[239:54.15]Frog?
[239:55.01]Could actually work out.
[239:56.12]Let me grab the frog here.
[240:03.82]Come on, this is it.
[240:04.60]This is the end.
[240:05.38]No, it's not.
[240:05.88]Fuck.
[240:06.10]Dude, I'm just seeing like a sea of... What's going on in the chat?
[240:11.57]What are you guys doing in here?
[240:15.03]There's no chat anymore.
[240:16.05]It's just like a bunch of nonsense.
[240:19.69]What are you doing in my chat?
[240:30.22]It's just calamity over here.
[240:33.42]What is happening here?
[240:37.83]Don't make me step in.
[240:39.81]I'll step in here and I will detonate this chat.
[240:43.37]I will turn it into a non-chat.
[240:46.09]I will detonate it.
[240:47.53]Don't test me here.
[240:52.50]Oh, don't test me here.
[240:57.78]We talked about me being a senator.
[240:58.90]You want me to step in and make some policy?
[241:07.13]Do it.
[241:07.91]They're testing me.
[241:09.12]Oh, they're testing my patience.
[241:10.14]Oh, isn't that funny?
[241:12.30]Isn't that funny?
[241:19.14]Isn't that funny?
[241:22.72]That wasn't even... That wasn't that funny, actually.
[241:24.34]It was pretty bad.
[241:24.88]That wasn't even funny.
[241:30.92]Senator Mega Man is going to step in here and cause a problem for you.
[241:38.12]Don't make me do some policy changes here that you aren't going to like.
[241:44.64]You voted for me.
[241:45.32]This is why I'm here.
[241:46.10]Don't make me raise the flag of justice.
[242:02.23]Powerful.
[242:03.05]It makes me feel so powerful when I delete the chat.
[242:06.31]I feel so in charge.
[242:11.56]Excuse me to rush like no other.
[242:13.15]You have to listen to me.
[242:16.29]I'm so strong.
[242:17.17]Alright, I'm done.
[242:20.63]Wait!
[242:22.23]I got it.
[242:24.49]Here comes the missile.
[242:25.69]It's alright.
[242:28.84]Ah, shit.
[242:30.90]I will, one of these times, I will get them all.
[242:37.00]Delete us.
[242:37.86]Delete us.
[242:38.86]You guys are just asking for it now.
[242:41.41]No, I'm not gonna... We're not gonna have the problems of few affect the many.
[242:48.12]There are people that are just hanging out here chatting.
[242:51.04]I ain't gonna let... I ain't gonna let some bad actors here pull us all down.
[242:56.42]Cut the junk, okay?
[242:57.74]Stop with the junk.
[243:02.48]Cut the junk or you're gonna get junk, okay?
[243:05.76]You cut the junk or you're gonna see junk.
[243:07.50]You're gonna see my junk if you don't cut it out.
[243:10.37]I got plenty of it.
[243:11.47]Cut the junk or you see my junk.
[243:19.35]Damn it.
[243:26.74]I could reach in my bag of trash and pull it all out.
[243:33.26]What the fuck is happening here?
[243:36.06]I want to try to get this at least once.
[243:38.30]I'm not going to spend any money.
[243:42.52]Here we are.
[243:42.92]We're in France again.
[243:43.88]This is where we were last time.
[243:46.19]Got plenty of lives, plenty of money.
[243:52.19]And here come the stealth enemies!
[243:55.39]Okay!
[243:57.05]Here comes the stealth enemies!
[243:58.75]Ah, yeah, we're gonna get so far.
[244:00.18]Right when I take off the Angler, that's just fucking fantastic.
[244:06.22]Mm-hmm.
[244:07.84]Yippity-dee.
[244:08.76]Oh, yippity-dippity-dee.
[244:11.14]Wow, this is fucking awesome.
[244:12.40]I'm so happy about this.
[244:26.77]What is fucking happening?
[244:28.11]Will you calm down?
[244:29.63]Alright, emote only mode.
[244:30.86]Do it.
[244:32.56]The senator has spoken.
[244:34.60]We're going only emotes for like 10 minutes until they've learned their lesson.
[244:38.22]Emote only.
[244:46.15]Senator Mega Man, I have a request.
[244:47.59]Yeah, emote only.
[244:48.87]How's that for a request?
[244:52.33]The senator has spoken.
[244:55.59]And my closing remarks are... Fuck, I'm gonna die.
[245:01.11]No way, please.
[245:06.45]There we are.
[245:07.96]Don't let the stealth scare you.
[245:16.91]Idiot.
[245:17.57]Oh, you got an idiot emote.
[245:19.14]Where'd you get that one from?
[245:20.02]Ah, look at that.
[245:24.08]I like to see funny little pictures.
[245:26.42]There's no more bad behavior.
[245:28.12]We just see funny pictures over here now.
[245:35.89]I don't think I'm gonna make it through this.
[245:37.33]I need an angler.
[245:38.05]Bad.
[245:44.31]It's possible.
[245:50.88]Alright, thank god.
[245:52.20]Frog actually worked out pretty well.
[245:53.40]What's... Wait, what?
[245:56.30]Why'd we do this?
[245:57.40]Why'd we take it off of... Angler.
[246:02.64]Ah!
[246:02.72]I'm dead again.
[246:11.80]I'm not spending any money.
[246:12.96]I'm gonna die anyway, so...
[246:17.51]Wait, stop spamming words, phrases.
[246:20.23]Alright, okay, guys, listen to me.

[246:25.69]So, like, you need to, you guys have to, you have to, you guys have to cut the shit.
[246:37.50]I need an angler so bad.

[246:59.75]That was close.
[247:08.86]I gotta get the Death Star here.
[247:10.50]Nope, sorry.
[247:14.36]Can he do it without the Angler?
[247:18.43]The answer is maybe.
[247:20.63]Maybe.
[247:24.48]Salty?
[247:24.88]Who's salty?

[250:43.56]Bingo!
[250:45.56]I want to see the boss in France and then we can all go home.
[250:54.02]The music's good too.
[250:56.01]I like the frogs theme song.
[251:00.50]Frog is the MVP of these levels.
[251:04.24]By a long shot.
[251:06.54]He just made that so easy.
[251:12.00]Look at this.
[251:13.58]Dammit, it blew up.

[251:41.22]This way?
[251:42.38]Yes.

[251:48.12]This is going to be bad.
[251:50.92]I really do have to pay attention.
[251:52.02]Quiet down.
[251:55.08]I can hear you breathing, chat.
[251:56.58]Please.
[251:57.72]Give me an opportunity to win.

[252:02.50]Can you please get a little bit... Just move back a little from your chair.
[252:07.29]Oh.
[252:08.21]Did you have Doritos earlier?
[252:09.76]Jesus Christ, it stinks.
[252:11.86]Your breath is fucking terrible, chat.
[252:14.72]Oh my god.
[252:15.34]What are you?
[252:15.72]Are you a dog?
[252:17.64]What did you do?
[252:18.16]Oh.
[252:29.87]Now's not the time to fuck around.
[252:37.50]Grab him.
[252:41.73]Grab him.
[252:51.09]I don't like that.
[252:53.85]I wanted to use that just for the damage on the guy.
[253:01.10]Too bad I don't have the super duper black Mamba.
[253:13.08]Nobody else coming out?
[253:22.03]Any more?
[253:22.35]Yep.
[253:22.73]Eee.
[253:24.85]Eee.
[253:26.61]Eee.
[253:27.75]Eee.
[253:29.29]Thank god.
[253:29.57]How have I not recharged those guys yet?
[253:34.59]Really?
[253:37.68]Oh, fuck.
[253:38.04]This is... I forget.
[253:39.06]I don't know how to do this.
[253:41.51]What happened?
[253:42.37]How am I supposed to dodge that?
[253:43.50]How do you dodge that?
[253:46.74]How am I supposed to dodge that?
[253:51.01]What am I missing here?
[253:52.09]How do I dodge that?
[253:54.43]He was underneath the chin.
[254:13.73]I was trying to dodge him, not shoot him.
[254:15.41]Damn it.
[254:19.67]I'm going to keep this, though.
[254:20.91]Yeah, I'm not spending any money.
[254:26.32]God damn it.
[254:27.18]He takes so long to kill.
[254:28.66]That takes so long to do.
[254:37.32]I'm on tilt now.
[254:42.54]Calm down.
[254:43.10]Just get back there.
[254:43.80]I got another life.
[254:44.62]I got plenty of ammo.
[254:45.56]I got plenty of health.
[254:46.32]Just get up there again, you fucking idiot.
[254:48.58]I need a big guy here.
[254:56.35]Give me a big guy, please.
[255:07.43]Make it happen again this time.
[255:08.59]Oh, fuck it up.
[255:09.47]Like a dumbass.
[255:10.60]Like a dummy idiot head.
[255:20.76]Frog does work out really well for this area.
[255:23.15]Just because of the tongue.
[255:23.91]You can just grab these huge guys and spin them around.
[255:26.83]Alright, not gonna happen again.
[255:28.79]Play it good and safe.
[255:37.68]Here comes the bullets.
[255:38.46]I just wish I didn't have to dodge these.
[255:44.32]That's what's causing me all the wasted shots that I can't shoot at them now.
[255:57.31]Yeah, here comes another one.
[255:58.35]Can't move.
[255:58.91]Oh, fuck you.
[256:02.65]Why do you have to do this to me like this?
[256:10.34]You have way too much health.
[256:11.96]Way too much.
[256:18.96]Mm-hmm.
[256:20.80]Up around what's going on.
[256:22.02]Right side?
[256:22.52]Yeah.
[256:26.21]Slow and steady with... What happened?
[256:29.43]Oh.
[256:33.09]I didn't even... Again, I didn't mean to do that.
[256:35.89]I just thought the game fucking crashed.
[256:44.62]Here comes the next phase where he does the dumb... This part sucks too.
[256:50.11]I'm so glad at least he doesn't do the stupid missiles during this.
[256:53.89]That would be unbearable.
[257:02.98]Still hasn't shot one.
[257:03.92]I'm getting pretty lucky.
[257:05.18]Oh, there it is.
[257:12.44]There we go.
[257:12.70]Alright.
[257:16.68]ding dong alright here comes the next phase just have to keep continuously shooting him although I have plenty of health though I'll be fine I might get hit once or twice but that's just the name of the game at this point
[257:46.36]I will have enough of the Black Mamba, though, if it does spawn.
[257:49.18]We will at least get to see that.
[257:53.64]My life can be complete.
[258:03.07]He moves too far away.
[258:03.95]Here we go.
[258:05.53]Alright.
[258:05.81]Keep away.
[258:06.55]Keep away.
[258:07.21]Keep him away.
[258:14.54]See, I was just panicking trying to dodge the blades.
[258:19.74]That's not how you do it.
[258:22.60]Well, come on.
[258:24.69]Get out of here.
[258:25.35]Just didn't have anything on that side currently pointing at him.
[258:38.41]I'm gonna do it again.
[258:40.31]Which side?
[258:40.73]Which side do you want?
[258:41.33]Which side do you want?
[258:42.19]Which side?
[258:44.07]Whose side are you on, man?
[258:47.30]Got it.
[258:52.74]Do we have enough to... No, we don't.
[258:54.72]Unfortunately.
[258:56.72]I don't have enough to buy a Black Mamba.
[258:59.47]And watch, one's gonna roll.
[259:00.91]No, it didn't.
[259:03.17]I'm not buying anything.
[259:05.63]I want enough for a Black Mamba.
[259:11.84]Strange cat.
[259:15.30]Alright, let's just, let's get to the Eiffel Tower.
[259:17.58]It's important.
[259:20.62]We'll have it here.
[259:21.74]Roll a black mamba so we can see it.
[259:23.08]And I might be able to replace the angler now.
[259:27.69]Don't, no, not yet.
[259:29.15]There is a few more of those stealth enemies.
[259:32.97]Hooray, right?
[259:33.83]You know, like, hooray.
[259:40.03]Tongue, please?
[259:48.71]Holy shit.
[259:52.22]That was a little too much.
[260:00.18]Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die!
[260:03.06]Die!
[260:03.56]Die!
[260:03.86]Please!
[260:04.41]Die!
[260:04.77]Why?
[260:05.81]Oh, these Mambas!
[260:06.57]I need more damage!
[260:07.27]Ugh!
[260:08.97]Angry!
[260:09.77]Angry!
[260:12.53]Fuck, man.
[260:13.93]This is getting bad.
[260:15.97]Like, I gotta know where to go.
[260:21.91]Holy shit.
[260:22.39]These things take so many hits.
[260:24.95]It's kind of insane.
[260:29.43]I need to grab those guys with the tongue.
[260:34.60]And only the tongue.
[260:41.28]They're not in range for me to do that though.
[260:47.92]Come here.
[260:48.48]Come here.
[260:55.93]Oh.
[260:57.19]So many stealth enemies on that side.
[260:58.99]Come on.
[260:59.55]Go, go, go.
[261:03.01]Tongue.
[261:06.51]Tongue.
[261:07.47]Yeah, just get the tongue on him.
[261:09.42]You'll be fine.
[261:16.72]I missed the tongue.
[261:18.04]That was not cool.
[261:20.87]Fuck me.
[261:21.62]It's just the wrong spot for me to turn it.
[261:24.48]Not in the correct area.
[261:34.07]God damn it, man.
[261:35.13]Give me a fucking break.
[261:37.43]Could you be... God damn it.
[261:46.44]They aren't fucking around anymore.
[261:49.64]Tongue.
[261:51.82]I'm gonna lose.
[261:53.86]I think I hit the wall here where I need to upgrade my character.
[261:56.56]Did I just eat a bullet?
[262:05.45]Yeah, we're at the... This is the wall.
[262:09.53]We made it to the wall.
[262:12.17]It takes like 10 shots to kill those things.
[262:16.83]I have one more chance to get a Black Mamba.
[262:33.65]I have, like, all this money I can't spend.
[262:36.45]Jesus Christ.
[262:37.13]I gotta keep moving.
[262:37.83]You can't just stand still.
[262:39.37]Not now.
[262:39.95]Not at this stage.
[262:40.60]Okay, somebody just did, like, a Patriots joke.
[262:48.60]Like, oh, Jeremy, I can't stand the fact that the Patriots lost.
[262:53.89]I don't give a shit about the Patriots.
[263:04.52]Like Tom Brady lost, oh well.
[263:07.24]He only won like fucking 12 times.
[263:09.00]Don't ever talk about Tom Brady like that again.
[263:13.18]I'm in a good spot here.
[263:21.77]Watch out for those.
[263:30.19]Grab him with tongue please.
[263:31.19]Thank you.
[263:38.61]Where's it coming down?
[263:39.33]That's fine.
[263:39.99]I can deal with it.
[263:45.86]Shit, shit, shit.
[263:47.00]That was bad.
[263:47.72]I had to do that.
[263:50.96]Hey, whatever gets me to the end of the level, right?
[263:52.50]I ain't trying to impress.
[263:56.12]Or am I?
[263:56.56]You know, I kind of am.
[264:05.35]You can trigger him with the Red Sox.
[264:07.85]Don't you do it.
[264:12.54]Don't you do it.
[264:14.10]I don't care either.
[264:15.70]I lost my interest in sports.
[264:19.26]Actually, pretty recently.
[264:22.39]I'd say the last season I really cared about for any sports team was probably like the 2000... Like the 2007 Red Sox when they won the World Series.
[264:33.74]Maybe.
[264:33.86]Maybe.
[264:35.58]Around, like, 2010, I kind of just stopped carrying, really.
[264:40.73]2011, maybe.
[264:40.97]That is recently.
[264:44.27]That's a long time.
[264:44.95]I don't know, like, four years ago?
[264:46.88]Maybe, like, 2012 is the last season I paid attention to.
[264:52.02]Give me a Black Mamba.
[264:52.78]That sucks.
[264:53.38]That's not fun.
[264:55.55]What's with all this garbage?
[265:01.87]A decade ago is recently.
[265:03.29]That wasn't a decade ago.
[265:04.43]Holy shit, it was a decade ago.
[265:06.61]That was 11 years ago.
[265:09.75]That was 11 years ago.
[265:11.60]I feel like that was two months ago.
[265:14.04]Holy shit.
[265:15.18]Wow.
[265:20.44]I don't know what to do here.
[265:21.84]Is this the one last level?
[265:23.08]I probably should take a little lobster claw here instead of this guy.
[265:26.22]Yeah, I still have enough for a mamba if I get one eventually.
[265:34.35]Yeah, I got one more shot here after this level to hopefully get a Mamba.
[265:44.99]I can't get rid of the Angler.
[265:45.87]Not now.
[265:46.19]It's already been... Okay, there's a new enemy type.
[265:48.02]I don't know what it does.
[265:49.32]Can I pick the tongue?
[265:51.96]Oh boy.
[265:53.60]Where is that going?
[265:55.48]All behind him.
[265:56.70]Can he be tongued?
[265:58.22]Yes, he can.
[266:01.21]Well, good thing I kept the frog.
[266:11.60]Watch out.
[266:12.37]There's a lot of missiles coming in here.
[266:15.29]Oh boy.
[266:15.81]Alright, tongue one and slam into the other one.
[266:20.29]If they're going to get in range.
[266:21.01]Get in range!
[266:22.29]Range! Range! Range!
[266:35.29]Tounge smash to the left- nope not enough time.
[266:46.16]Seems to have worked out in our favor a few times.
[266:51.06]God damn it.
[266:51.94]That stupid claw didn't claw.
[266:55.19]What do I pay you for?
[266:55.97]Okay, there we go.
[267:15.48]Just timing that.
[267:16.32]I got it timed.
[267:17.12]Okay.
[267:18.98]Die.
[267:20.16]Please die.
[267:27.93]Almost there.
[267:28.97]And we can roll one more time to hopefully get a Black Mamba.
[267:31.83]Right in the middle.
[267:41.30]Oof.
[267:48.51]Huge wave incoming.
[267:50.49]Not good.
[267:50.99]Just sit here for a second to get rid of the dumb orange planes.
[267:53.47]Yellow planes.
[267:54.09]I know they're yellow.
[267:54.85]Don't worry.
[267:57.61]I may have said their incorrect color right there, but that's fine.
[268:00.08]Sometimes you make mistakes.
[268:06.46]What?
[268:08.86]What?
[268:09.74]What actually?
[268:10.84]Do I have to be in the head?
[268:14.51]In what world did I just get hit in the head?
[268:17.15]What a world.
[268:27.96]We're all humans, we make mistakes.
[268:30.16]This is true.
[268:31.66]Alright, pray for a Black Mamba.
[268:33.32]This is the last opportunity we're going to get to potentially lose to the boss.
[268:39.06]Roll, roll, roll!
[268:39.94]Black Mamba!
[268:43.59]Fuck you.
[268:46.05]Well, these are all bad.
[268:48.67]So I may as well just buy an extra life.
[268:50.11]Because what else am I going to do here?
[268:57.05]I could replace, no, the beef of the angler maybe.
[268:59.25]Got a penguin at least.
[269:05.16]I'd rather take the extra life than the starfish.
[269:10.36]Let's go with that.
[269:12.90]Frog might be useless here though.
[269:16.29]Yeah.
[269:18.79]I don't think the frog is going to be useful here.
[269:20.87]This is the boss.
[269:21.87]Can't grab the boss.
[269:28.72]At least the penguin will give me some random damage.
[269:30.64]And at least I can freeze the boss and slow him down.
[269:37.70]Yeah, I mean, I know what you're thinking.
[269:38.86]The angler would be pretty useful here, but at the same time, Woody though, because this is the boss level.
[269:47.29]I do need to get rid of these things.
[269:54.52]Let's just do that.
[269:55.14]I feel like I need to do that.
[269:59.34]That could have caused me... I like the idea I had there because that was going to cause me a lot of problems.
[270:03.56]I was going to get collapsed on.
[270:04.84]Where's that going?
[270:07.00]Where's it going?
[270:07.42]I could have just stayed... No, didn't want to risk that.
[270:10.48]Didn't want to just stand still and get killed.
[270:13.54]Bad idea.
[270:14.44]Okay, where are we?
[270:20.58]Okay, a lot of people back here.
[270:22.20]Holy shit, you all have to die now.
[270:28.84]Where are they going?
[270:33.60]Come on, I'm not even at the boss.
[270:36.06]There's so many of you.
[270:37.30]Why are there this many of you?
[270:42.83]God damn it.
[270:49.65]Die.
[270:50.25]Please die.
[270:50.63]Ugh.
[271:04.91]Oh my god.
[271:05.71]What the fuck is that thing?
[271:08.05]What was that?
[271:08.49]I think that was the boss.
[271:13.61]Yeah, I need upgrades.
[271:16.11]I feel like I need to be doing more damage.
[271:18.69]These are all tier 2.
[271:19.55]I don't have any tier 3 weapons.
[271:26.56]I'm fucking dead.
[271:28.78]I'm so dead.
[271:29.60]Can I at least just see the boss before I'm dead here?
[271:39.43]Just go.
[271:42.65]Go and spawn the boss.
[271:50.48]Giganto Mime is approaching.
[271:52.30]I'm ready to instantly lose.
[271:56.36]Let's see, maybe he's brainless.
[271:57.60]Let's hope he's like a brainless enemy.
[271:58.86]Okay, shoot him in the face.
[272:06.10]I'm very scared to go near this guy.
[272:08.58]I don't have... What is he doing?
[272:13.82]Okay, well... Nice.
[272:17.89]What is that?
[272:19.09]Is that a fake gun?
[272:20.67]Does this guy do anything?
[272:21.59]Is this a joke, boss?
[272:25.89]What is he doing?
[272:28.00]I can't get close enough to hit him.
[272:40.72]I don't think he does anything.
[272:41.76]Although, I'm still very concerned.
[272:51.00]This is going to be a joke until, like, Phase 2.
[272:53.77]He'll turn into something weird in Phase 2.
[272:55.03]The rockets on his back are going to start shooting.
[272:58.79]I wish I didn't have one health here.
[272:59.93]I probably would be able to beat this.
[273:08.70]Anyway, you gotta hit him in the head.
[273:12.42]Trust me, I'm telling you, at one point he's gonna shoot me with an invisible arrow and he's gonna kill me.
[273:17.12]No.
[273:17.82]Doesn't even hurt.
[273:21.66]Right?
[273:22.26]That's scaring me.
[273:23.40]It's gonna be real.
[273:24.82]His shit's gonna turn into real stuff.
[273:28.96]See?
[273:29.32]I knew it.
[273:29.74]See, now he's angry.
[273:33.75]This stealth shit.
[273:35.21]I'm dead.
[273:35.91]See you later.
[273:38.61]I actually need an angler.
[273:40.37]Really?
[273:41.53]Really?
[273:43.87]What the fuck are these things gonna do here?
[273:45.67]Oh, I can't cross them.
[273:49.51]Now he's even more angry.
[273:50.42]What's that mean?
[273:50.96]His head comes out.
[273:51.86]Where are they going?
[273:56.28]Let's play it easy.
[274:01.84]Phase 3, we'll see what it is.
[274:05.64]I can't go anywhere.
[274:06.37]I just need to sit here and be careful.
[274:15.71]Okay, let's get him.
[274:16.29]A few hits on him, on his head.
[274:20.07]Slow.
[274:20.83]Be slow.
[274:21.59]Don't do anything dumb.
[274:22.74]I have my recharges back.
[274:23.92]Wherever they go, I got plenty of time.
[274:27.40]I'm gonna sit here.
[274:33.03]Right here.
[274:33.29]Don't move.
[274:37.13]This might take a while, but I might do it.
[274:39.17]Depends on what he does in phase 3.
[274:50.03]Back it up.
[274:51.99]Don't be an imbecile.
[274:55.39]Where's it going?
[274:58.43]Y'all know I had to do that.
[275:00.30]Like, I had to do that.
[275:01.08]I was in a very awkward spot.
[275:07.68]Don't make this awkward.
[275:13.47]Come on!
[275:14.39]This head's gonna come down and clip him.
[275:16.25]Clip his head.
[275:19.93]Where is it going?
[275:22.01]Wah!
[275:25.85]Come on!
[275:26.99]I couldn't turn!
[275:27.67]I was gonna get hit if I turned.
[275:30.52]Where are they going?
[275:34.62]Straight down on me?
[275:36.12]Yep.
[275:37.22]Head's coming down, clip his head.
[275:43.61]I got my charges back.
[275:45.19]Here comes phase three.
[275:46.01]Don't do anything different or weird.
[275:47.19]It's gonna be different or weird.
[275:48.03]It's gonna hit me right now.
[275:49.31]I think he shot three.
[275:53.77]You know, I... I freaked out.
[275:55.59]I had to.
[275:55.85]I just freaked the fuck out right there.
[275:58.50]I was panicked.
[275:59.36]Panic.
[275:59.60]I'm panicking.
[276:00.84]What's this?
[276:01.24]He's got a giant thing of bread.
[276:03.10]How far does that go?
[276:04.20]What do I have to do?
[276:09.18]Alright, this is not that bad.
[276:10.80]Just calm down.
[276:11.76]Shh.
[276:20.49]His head's down.
[276:21.71]Clear this.
[276:22.97]What?
[276:23.55]No, I just, it was frozen.
[276:25.05]It was blue and I didn't see it.
[276:26.21]The game is just fucking closed.
[276:27.46]What?
[276:57.48]What the hell happened?
[276:58.28]Why did the game fucking close?
[277:07.49]Okay, wait a minute.
[277:09.27]Continue game, Paras 3.
[277:10.15]We'll get to live another day.
[277:20.45]Okay, so that was, that was, we're fine?
[277:23.41]So, um, what do I do about this?
[277:26.89]Do I do an angler here instead of one of the claws?
[277:29.81]Do I replace the bee?
[277:31.49]Get rid of the penguin?
[277:33.67]I could do an extra tentacle, but what's that going to do for me?
[277:35.81]Extra tentacle and what?
[277:41.53]Extra tentacle, I'm going to put it right here.
[277:44.65]And then... Angler?
[277:51.19]I guess that's the only thing I can do at this point.
[277:53.65]Let's do it.
[277:55.23]I know what he does now.
[277:56.27]Let's get this kill.
[277:57.67]Because the stream's over after this.
[277:59.93]Win or lose.
[278:02.61]I'm ready.
[278:04.09]I have plenty of health.
[278:05.47]I'll at least beat this part.
[278:09.27]You know I will.
[278:20.46]Fuck you.
[278:20.86]Don't hit me.
[278:22.98]I'm good.
[278:28.58]Not in a good place.
[278:30.86]Bad place.
[278:31.46]Like, there's nowhere I can go.
[278:33.20]I've, like, fucked it up.
[278:34.04]Like, I have to get to the boss, like, now.
[278:37.03]This placement is so terrible.
[278:38.15]I should have separated the stupid claws.
[278:40.05]Oh, it's... I'm... Just calm down.
[278:42.09]I'm so angry at myself for fucking not putting the angler between the claws.
[278:46.87]And it's gonna cost me the game.
[278:49.47]Because I have three useless things here.
[278:51.98]One, two, three fucking useless.
[278:54.04]Why did I do this to myself?
[279:01.09]It's gonna cost me the goddamn game.
[279:03.01]Half of my entire character is useless.
[279:05.33]It's only the shooters that are doing it.
[279:06.85]Calm down.
[279:07.25]Stop it.
[279:12.12]I have three support on one side.
[279:15.52]Like, what a dickhead.
[279:16.64]What's that thing?
[279:17.94]Holy shit.
[279:18.52]I just... Got a lot of shells.
[279:23.13]Wow.
[279:24.17]That's a lot.
[279:27.83]That's a stupid amount of free shells.
[279:32.61]I just got the random drop.
[279:37.51]That's pretty cool.
[279:39.48]Here we go.
[279:40.30]This time I'm not going to be timid.
[279:41.22]I know what he does in the first couple phases.
[279:42.48]We're going to get him and I'm going to win.
[279:45.32]Here comes a win.
[279:53.12]Can't get in that corner.
[279:55.12]Can you back up, sir?
[279:59.96]Back up.
[280:03.89]Back it up!
[280:04.31]Here we go.
[280:09.87]Thank you.
[280:15.42]I'm gonna get hit in the first phase, it's gonna be so bad.
[280:17.34]It's gonna be so embarrassing when he kills me in phase one.
[280:26.47]Here comes phase two incoming.
[280:37.54]Right in the chin.
[280:38.54]Right in his chin strap.
[280:43.38]Okay, here we go.
[280:43.96]Get the shots and then I need to get in.
[280:45.78]Got plenty of time.
[280:49.13]This is a massive DPS moment right here.
[280:50.87]That's a massive DPS.
[280:52.49]Alright, where are they going?
[280:57.19]They're right there.
[280:58.86]That's fine.
[281:00.04]I can handle that.
[281:03.90]His head's coming down.
[281:04.98]I can't get over there.
[281:05.78]Wowee!
[281:07.77]Can't get over there in time.
[281:10.53]Sorry.
[281:11.07]We'll do some damage now.
[281:13.29]By now, I mean like now.
[281:15.53]Where are those going?
[281:25.82]Right in here.
[281:26.24]Right in the face.
[281:31.55]He's eating it.
[281:32.27]Good.
[281:34.57]Good!
[281:35.60]Phase 3!
[281:36.60]Here comes more of those dumb things.
[281:41.46]See?
[281:41.90]I have Composure.
[281:45.65]I didn't totally lose my Composure.
[281:49.71]Looks like we're gonna get ourselves a win.
[281:51.19]French bread!
[281:51.83]Watch it!
[281:55.72]Can't hurt him by shooting the French bread.
[282:01.29]Well, the one part that sucks about having the extra tentacle is I can't shoot in both directions at the same time.
[282:05.09]That makes it a little bit harder.
[282:14.45]Come on, he's just trapping me in here!
[282:16.85]Get me out of here!
[282:17.57]There we go.
[282:22.26]Where are they going?
[282:23.00]Where are they going?
[282:23.76]We're good.
[282:29.18]Here come the hits.
[282:30.02]French bread, excuse me.
[282:35.71]Oh wow, you gotta be giving me a break here.
[282:38.17]You've gotta be giving me a break here.
[282:44.65]God damn it.
[282:45.25]That's a load of bullshit.
[282:51.70]I'm gonna get hit by this.
[282:53.16]I'm panicking.
[282:54.26]I'm freaking out.
[282:55.84]I've lost all control.
[282:58.14]I just gotta kill him.
[282:59.06]Because I'm, like, ready to be done.
[283:00.42]I don't even care if I get hit.
[283:05.02]Just end it.
[283:08.42]There comes the face.
[283:09.30]Right in the head.
[283:10.66]Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo.
[283:11.66]Game over.
[283:14.76]Now we just have to destroy the Eiffel Tower.
[283:17.18]And don't choke on his.
[283:18.78]And we'll be fine.
[283:25.64]This is why I brought the claws for this one particular instance.
[283:32.42]It's time to choke.
[283:36.78]Come on.
[283:38.20]Come on.
[283:39.94]Come on, dude.
[283:41.52]Okay.
[283:43.60]Hey, that's done.
[283:45.26]Another egg.
[283:48.46]Let's see what buddy it is this time.
[283:53.47]You found Ursula the Urchin.
[283:56.33]Press both left and right to launch spikes.
[284:01.01]Interesting.
[284:03.09]I kind of want to upgrade shit.
[284:06.31]I want to level up here.
[284:07.01]I kind of want to see what she does.
[284:15.48]Maybe I'm going to assume just shooting spikes in all directions?
[284:17.58]Maybe?
[284:17.82]There's projectiles in the air?
[284:20.71]I don't know.
[284:33.38]Alright, that's pretty cool.
[284:35.26]That lasts for a long time.
[284:36.54]Yeah.
[284:42.43]That's pretty neat.
[284:47.11]I would say that's not worth putting on over the Blowfish if it didn't last that long.
[284:52.37]That's pretty overpowered in a lot of scenarios.
[284:57.08]It might not be an easy drop, though.
[284:59.00]That might be a rare drop.
[285:01.77]I'm assuming it's probably not the easiest thing to shuffle into your deck.
[285:06.11]Whatever you want to call it.
[285:07.35]Deck.
[285:09.83]Tentacle system thing.
[285:15.77]Halfway there.
[285:22.65]No, I'm going to miss it.
[285:23.47]It's going to be right in the middle.
[285:24.63]I knew it.
[285:27.27]Got it.
[285:34.58]No!
[285:36.10]No, not worth it.
[285:37.52]I do have one, though.
[285:38.94]I'm probably gonna use it.
[285:39.64]Let's just use it.
[285:48.27]I'm using it.
[285:49.73]Just for fun.
[285:53.99]That's so cool.
[285:54.57]Mm-hmm.
[286:03.14]Shells!
[286:06.37]So is this like a suicide mission here where I just want to die and just do upgrades and then end stream?
[286:10.19]What do you think?
[286:14.37]Shit, I didn't get it.
[286:20.79]An elephant trunk!
[286:22.77]Got a new DNA.
[286:23.59]Elephant DNA.
[286:24.33]Pushes things back.
[286:27.96]I like it.
[286:28.52]So it's support.
[286:31.52]Just 5,000.
[286:33.02]Well, hey, we get to try the elephant trunk.
[286:35.67]Why not?
[286:36.13]Let's put it on where the... Well, let's... Yeah, I don't... I'm not afraid of... Let's try it.
[286:45.71]I got one opportunity.
[286:46.63]We're going to see.
[286:47.29]This is... Destroy the... This is the last mission.
[286:49.53]Destroy the White House.
[286:55.26]So we are on the final mission of the game.
[287:03.34]Destroy the White House.
[287:07.40]But I believe there is more after you complete the storyline.
[287:13.22]Let's see how well this works.
[287:19.97]Well, we're getting... This is just... This just turned... They turned up the difficulty here by like times 10.
[287:26.11]Two of these guys at the same time.
[287:34.76]Why has it got to be the White House?
[287:36.30]We already did America.
[287:37.08]We destroyed New York.
[287:40.08]Now you want to go destroy DC?
[287:40.94]Come on, we didn't even get like a funny little YouTube video.
[287:44.84]I don't know.
[287:54.94]Alright, the push of things back is... It's been pretty effective here.
[288:01.97]I can't tell what it's doing.
[288:07.57]It's the jellyfish that are hitting me.
[288:08.71]How do I hurt the jellyfish?
[288:17.88]Can the jellyfish be hurt?
[288:19.98]I'm missing something here.
[288:20.84]I'm missing something here.
[288:22.76]Push him back.
[288:26.30]Okay, I get it.
[288:27.05]You have to push those back, I think.
[288:30.63]Or suffer the consequences.
[288:36.39]Whoops-a-daisy.
[288:37.43]It's okay, we're about to lose.
[288:44.83]Woo!
[288:48.01]Let me get to a clean 700 shells, please.
[288:55.56]Didn't even get to see the Black Mamba, either.
[288:57.04]That's unfortunate.
[289:00.52]Move him out of the way, please.
[289:01.40]Come on.
[289:01.62]Come on, cool, clean 700 shells.
[289:10.25]Dangerous.
[289:11.65]Dangerous.
[289:21.30]The Frosty Freezey Freeze does not seem to do very well against any of these enemies in this stage.
[289:25.92]They only get frozen for like one half of a second.
[289:41.24]1 HP, can he... I don't think he can.
[289:48.49]Oh, I don't think he can.
[289:51.75]Where is that patented Jeremy confidence?
[289:55.19]Should be here!
[289:57.94]Snuffleupagus, blow him away, please!
[290:10.72]Watch it.
[290:22.36]Looking good.
[290:24.10]Almost there.
[290:30.00]That was pretty good timing for that, I'm not gonna lie.
[290:32.06]It was.
[290:33.96]Got all the Sharks moving in a row.
[290:38.03]At the end of this level.
[290:40.44]This is kind of one of those situations where you just go until you lose.
[290:43.44]No, that's what we're going to do.
[290:47.54]No, never mind.
[290:51.51]This may be the end.
[290:55.91]Maybe, maybe not.
[290:56.61]They got three.
[291:00.79]One of these little chompers is going to end up getting me.
[291:05.55]I can smell it.
[291:06.97]No, get it.
[291:10.53]Over 700.
[291:10.73]Come on.
[291:11.35]There it is.
[291:14.05]702.
[291:18.31]No black Mamba.
[291:20.46]I'm getting a lot of garbage.
[291:21.54]Where are all the cool things I unlocked?
[291:23.98]Give me a rare card.
[291:28.22]Can't do anything.
[291:29.74]There's nothing I really want to replace.
[291:33.60]Yeah.
[291:35.26]Let's go.
[291:49.20]Yeah, so from my understanding is when you beat the game, I think it unlocks like another mode, I think?
[291:55.34]Some kind of mode where you can play through and it's way, way harder.
[291:58.77]The upgrades still persist.
[292:00.03]I think that's the case.
[292:01.07]I don't want to be certain of saying this, but I'm pretty sure that's the case.
[292:13.48]They're everywhere.
[292:15.36]They're everywhere.
[292:15.94]They're everywhere.
[292:16.40]They're everywhere.
[292:17.90]Snow.
[292:18.28]Blow the snow.
[292:33.35]It's like a clock.
[292:34.00]It's like a big deadly clock.
[292:43.19]I have no abilities right now.
[292:47.80]Shit.
[292:52.63]One of these little shits is gonna swing around.
[292:54.95]I know it.
[293:08.73]Again, here they come again.
[293:10.37]Just keep it coming.
[293:11.33]Just throw them all at me at the same time, why don't you?
[293:18.85]Blow them away.
[293:20.23]They're not close enough.
[293:27.57]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[293:28.60]Get away, get away, get away.
[293:30.38]Get away!
[293:35.70]Fuck.
[293:37.00]Oh, fuck.
[293:37.72]Oh, fuck.
[293:40.33]This is the end.
[293:41.55]Don't say that yet.
[293:42.15]Not yet.
[293:50.27]Shit.
[293:50.97]Oh, god damn it.
[293:51.87]That was close.
[293:52.36]That was so close.
[293:57.04]Alright.
[293:58.80]Well, we have a lot of money.
[294:00.56]What is this?
[294:04.48]Start with more money.
[294:07.01]Retaliation.
[294:10.22]Three starting tentacles.
[294:16.04]I wonder what to do here.
[294:16.72]Okay, buy one more, we get a heart.
[294:23.70]Retaliation is cool, but let's get the thing we want the most here.
[294:27.48]Scallop.
[294:29.16]This is the better version, again.
[294:33.38]Narwhal horn.
[294:35.12]We gotta get the narwhal.
[294:36.00]Alright.
[294:38.12]Get into the heart space.
[294:40.40]Now let's start with three tentacles.
[294:43.36]That is very good.
[294:49.05]Hmm.
[294:49.91]Scallop?
[294:50.67]Extra slot?
[294:52.41]Yeah.
[294:53.23]Extra slot.
[294:55.13]It gives us more chance to roll something.
[294:56.59]We can do the turtle, maybe.
[294:58.87]I don't know.
[295:03.11]We can do two.
[295:04.29]This is like a shotgun.
[295:05.37]Let's do this.
[295:10.19]25.
[295:10.21]We still don't have enough.
[295:11.65]It's alright.
[295:12.29]Let's get a scallop, too.
[295:19.77]Is Queen Bee conch?
[295:24.30]Alright.
[295:27.48]Well, I think that's going to be it.
[295:31.23]That is going to be it for tonight.
[295:33.99]Let me just see.
[295:34.73]The enemy is choosing what to attack with.
[295:36.17]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[295:36.89]Let me just... I'm surprised there's no... There's no... Oh, whoops.
[295:44.15]View Compendium.
[295:44.69]Let's take a look at something here.
[295:49.40]Alright, so here are all the parts.
[295:53.28]So as you can see...
[295:56.26]We still have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[296:00.88]Okay, there's like 12 things that still aren't here.
[296:08.16]And there are still a lot of enemies that we haven't seen.
[296:16.01]So I'm going to assume...
[296:18.54]Yeah, so I can't imagine, because if there is, what, four more levels?
[296:23.59]Let's say I unlock one of these after every other level.
[296:26.13]One, two, three, four.
[296:28.31]So there has to be another mode where you unlock the rest of this shit, right?
[296:37.01]This is cool, though.
[296:41.24]Twelve not unlocked.
[296:52.05]The mouse is off-center?
[296:53.21]What do you mean?
[296:57.49]How's the mouse?
[296:58.33]Oh, what do you mean the mouse is off-center?
[297:02.07]Oh, okay.
[297:02.77]I see what you're saying.
[297:04.17]Now I understand what you mean by that.
[297:05.89]Okay.
[297:07.85]That is really odd.
[297:09.35]I didn't know what the hell somebody meant by that.
[297:11.69]That's strange because that's not happening on my screen.
[297:15.76]That is very weird.
[297:17.72]But whatever.
[297:22.46]I wonder why that is.
[297:23.02]That's strange.
[297:25.34]Okay.
[297:26.76]Well... Let's go to the main menu.
[297:35.65]So this is, um... Low res is likely the cause.
[297:41.99]Yeah, probably.
[297:43.01]That's strange, though.
[297:46.27]Alright, yeah, that's gonna wrap it up.
[297:47.89]So here's what we're gonna do tomorrow.
[297:49.45]There's a lot of shit that I have to do to get ready for tomorrow, but we might.
[297:53.93]Here's what we might do.
[297:57.78]I want to finish this game and do more of the challenge stuff on stream.
[298:02.74]So we're gonna do that tomorrow.
[298:04.84]We're gonna start with this tomorrow, beat it, and check out some of the other modes potentially.
[298:11.00]And then after that, we're gonna go from there, maybe back to Alpha Protocol.
[298:20.59]Look, there's a lot of things to me to set up.
[298:22.75]I've got a lot of shit that's going to be in this office.
[298:27.19]So if I can get light gun shit ready to go tomorrow, then we'll do that.
[298:31.00]But in the case that it's not ready yet, we'll do this.
[298:34.36]We'll finish this game tomorrow, and then we'll do more Alpha Protocol.
[298:41.06]Anyways, this has been great.
[298:46.25]This game's really good.
[298:47.05]This game's 12 bucks.
[298:53.62]Behind no means was this a sponsored stream, but GeorgeFan did reach out to me and was like, hey, you should play this game.
[299:00.79]And I am.
[299:02.01]So take that however you want it.
[299:03.77]But we talked about this game like two or three weeks ago.
[299:07.19]This is a game I was going to just play anyways.
[299:10.15]You all know that.
[299:11.33]But actually turns out to be pretty good.
[299:14.18]So, recommend.
[299:16.92]It's not like some cash grab game where it's trying to strain you a bunch of money.
[299:20.70]It's fucking like $11.80 right now.
[299:30.46]friend recommends a game to streamer go to jail now what a good sponsored stream no I I hate that that's like the norm now to have to be able to be like no it's not sponsored
[299:45.07]I'm a huge fan of his games.
[299:46.79]There you go.
[299:47.29]So it was very cool, actually, that he said hello to me.
[299:50.73]That was very, very interesting, because literally Plants vs. Zombies and especially Insane Aquarium are two of my, like... Insane Aquarium, at least, is one of my favorite just time-waster kind of chill games ever.
[300:01.19]So that's really cool.
[300:04.29]Let's get to the bits, because there were a lot that I missed, so... We're going to put the stamp, the Recommend This Game stamp on Octogun.
[300:16.00]Give it a try.
[300:18.82]And with that... Hey, look at that.
[300:22.91]There's an outro here.
[300:26.41]Let's go to over here.
[300:27.67]Let's get the bits.
[300:31.19]So, thank you to... Starting all the way back here.

[303:08.60]Maybe.
[303:08.74]Maybe.

[303:12.49]No, that's not me saying that.
[303:14.71]I mean, it's me saying that, but I'm saying it through a bit donation.

[304:05.57]Um, I think I've talked about this before.
[304:07.06]videogamedunkey is hilarious.
[304:10.14]Some of his videos are some of my favorite videos, like, on YouTube.
[304:14.28]Dunkey's, like, Dunkey's Captcha video... I would consider that to be a perfect video.
[304:21.46]In my opinion.
[304:22.46]Honestly.
[304:25.26]Uh, but thank you for that, TatoSeal.
[304:27.74]ForRealDoe, thanks for the $1.
[304:29.95]Here's another fun game where you destroy the world.

[304:47.60]Why Octogeddon is a meme game?
[304:49.58]No, it's not.

[305:05.59]I'm gonna keep it up.
[305:07.45]I'm gonna keep it up as hard as I can.
[305:11.71]Fuck.
[305:12.17]That was a little... Came out wrong.
[305:15.05]Thank you, Kurti.
[305:16.68]Will I play Subnautica again?
[305:19.20]Kurti for the 50 cents here.
[305:21.08]Thank you.
[305:23.68]Probably not if I'm really honest because there's just we have this too many things going on all of next week is gonna be Look, let me break it down for you.
[305:34.11]I now own in this house a PlayStation 1 a PlayStation 2 a Dreamcast a bunch of light gun games a ton of games like there's so much that this we have like literally hundreds of games that we can play and
[305:51.98]That that's the plan over the we're not gonna only gonna do like PlayStation fucking one games But then you got like vermintide is coming out here A way out is coming out here.
[306:00.94]There's some new games.
[306:02.70]There's a lot going on That's gonna be hard to fit anything else after this coming week here after tomorrow So SEGA cdr we already did with the whole SEGA cd
[306:16.97]There are so many games for those systems that are classics, that need to be played, that are weird, obscure.
[306:22.32]Especially for the Dreamcast.
[306:23.38]The Dreamcast is full of weird shit that we have to play.
[306:27.52]But Subnautica probably will not return.
[306:31.84]As much as it is an interesting, fun game.
[306:35.62]Not so sure we'll play it again.
[306:37.38]At least on the stream.
[306:40.26]Comcast Customer Care, thanks for the five dollars.
[306:43.28]The Cloverfield video game seems to have taken a couple liberties.
[306:50.49]I see, I get you.
[306:51.77]But wait, by the way, didn't the Cloverfield movies suck?
[306:54.79]Didn't they do this big thing where Netflix was like, oh yeah, here's the trailer for it.
[306:59.00]And it's watchable right now on Netflix.
[307:01.82]And the movie is awful.
[307:06.06]Thank God they spent like $16 million on that Super Bowl marketing campaign to launch a shitty fucking half movie.
[307:18.21]But, yeah.
[307:19.61]Thank you, Comcast.
[307:20.71]Customer care.
[307:22.25]Hey, eatwhirt, eatwhirtwhirt, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[307:24.30]Jerma, I'm traveling to Boston from Australia in a month.
[307:27.06]How do I not die?
[307:29.18]Also, will you ever stream SWAT 4?
[307:31.64]Let's answer all those questions.
[307:33.98]The first one, traveling from Boston to Australia.
[307:37.37]How do you not die?
[307:38.07]Well, drink plenty of fluids.
[307:41.67]Eat good meals.
[307:44.39]Trust that you have good traveling, good travel.
[307:49.69]Which, I mean, at this point, yeah.
[307:51.49]We're not in, like, the 30s.
[307:54.12]Like, the Wright brothers know how to fly planes.
[307:56.84]So I think you're going to be okay.
[307:58.62]Get enough sleep.
[308:00.22]And yes, I'm going to play SWAT 4.
[308:02.44]Yes.
[308:03.44]That's been something that's been on the table for a long time.
[308:05.62]Yes, I will.
[308:06.42]You'll see it.
[308:07.41]But thank you for your $10, dude.
[308:10.35]Enjoy your trip to Boston.
[308:12.03]Wait, are you talking about PAX East?
[308:13.69]Are you going to PAX East?
[308:16.11]Are you going to Pax East?
[308:17.15]Is that what this is about?
[308:18.99]Because that would make sense if you were here in like a month.
[308:29.80]Thank you, StixRenegade, for the $1.
[308:31.32]Diarrhea inside my mouth.
[308:33.86]Did something happen long ago, Jeremy?
[308:35.54]No.
[308:38.25]Well, I mean, plenty of things happened long ago, but that's not one of them.
[308:43.23]He said, cool.
[308:43.85]Cool.
[308:46.72]Cool.
[308:48.15]What was it?
[308:48.57]Cool?
[308:48.95]Only cool?
[308:50.71]Did I miss it?
[308:53.47]Machete Mario, thanks for the $1.
[308:55.13]Would you fuck a bee?
[308:56.27]No.
[308:57.15]Not only is that just revolting, that's also physically not a possibility in any world at all.
[309:03.34]So the answer is no.
[309:04.94]That is wrong and disgusting.
[309:07.22]And two, not physically possible.
[309:09.92]Thank you for the $1.
[309:11.04]Boy Pablo, thanks for the $1.
[309:13.56]Actual octopipipupu.
[309:18.10]actually not ppp yes boy Pablo thank you for the one dollar sir feline thanks for the one dollar number of seagull arms determines the quality of the game we all know that we actually don't know if there is a seagull arm there might be might be another bird it's possible for another bird arm thank you sir feline though for your one dollar of course asha again I told you the hundred dollars but there was also the fifty dollars from asha
[309:46.46]Way too fucking kind, Asha.
[309:48.16]Thank you so much.
[309:50.15]Such a normal answer for a silly question.
[309:57.41]Would you rather fuck a human-sized bee or be... be a bee-sized... Would you rather fuck a human-sized bee or be bee-sized and fuck a bee?
[310:07.57]How about I'd rather not have sex with an animal?
[310:12.58]Like, you know what?
[310:13.26]Like, what?
[310:13.60]What are we talking about?
[310:15.75]I don't wanna be an animal and have a procreation with another animal.
[310:21.85]How about we just make the record clear there?
[310:27.15]Not an option.
[310:32.28]Don't enable them.
[310:34.52]I can't, what do you mean don't enable them?
[310:36.28]These are questions that are coming up in like, that wasn't a bit.
[310:39.38]Was that a bit question?
[310:41.28]It was a bit question.
[310:47.51]Answer the question.
[310:48.65]I don't have to answer any question.
[310:54.46]How about we just say... Protect the bees.
[310:57.70]Because they're running out.
[310:59.20]We're running out of them.
[311:00.90]We need to saw some trees down and get some sap and dump it into a box and then breed a bunch of bees.
[311:07.47]Cut down all the fucking trees.
[311:09.23]Cut them all down.
[311:10.29]Get in that rainforest and just saw down every tree so we can make sure the bees have sap to survive.
[311:20.10]Thank you to Erroliss for the $1.
[311:22.24]I'm sorry to bring up dabbing, but did you see that New York Times article?
[311:27.34]No.
[311:28.72]That's not...
[311:38.86]The bee... Okay, we have to read... This is still part of that disgusting bullshit, but this is actually really funny.
[311:46.04]Floryboy says, If the bees are dying out, then you should do your part by making sure the lineage survives.
[311:53.97]Ay-yi-yi.
[311:59.71]That's good.
[312:00.59]That's actually pretty funny.
[312:02.25]I'm going to have to give that to you.
[312:05.69]Uh, yeah, 419, thanks for the $1.
[312:07.59]Hey Jerma, when is Gloom Man going to turn heel?
[312:10.42]You're just talking about a possibility that's never going to be real.
[312:15.22]That's not, that's not possible.
[312:16.84]He's too, he's too good.
[312:18.44]He's too pure.
[312:20.94]Thank you, Scripps3, for the $5.
[312:23.96]Have you ever thought about doing a yearly TF2 catch-up stream?
[312:29.16]Where you revisit for just one stream a year and do old jokes and your impression on game changes.
[312:35.56]Old jokes.
[312:37.04]Also, have you seen the changes in the Jungle Inferno?
[312:40.12]I've seen pretty much all the changes, but TF2 is just one of those games where... I'm just done with it.
[312:47.66]I don't necessarily want to load up TF2 just to make a bunch of old references.
[312:54.17]That would be like a Seinfeld reunion.
[312:56.17]I don't want to do a reunion show, right?
[312:59.18]I want to just move forward.
[313:00.96]Because going back and doing like a reunion show to me is, I mean, maybe when I retire, okay?
[313:05.98]If I stop doing YouTube or Twitch, if I stop doing streaming and you don't hear from me for like four or five years, then like maybe after being retired for like 10 years, I'll do a reunion show.
[313:16.31]Come back, I'm like fucking 45 and I'm going to talk about like SPs and TF2.
[313:20.25]I'll jump into a game and we'll do an actual true reunion show.
[313:31.29]That's sad.
[313:34.08]I said, oh yeah, I fucking said the word.
[313:38.38]But the Seinfeld reunion on Curb was actually great.
[313:40.94]Yeah, it was.
[313:41.48]Because Larry David is a genius.
[313:44.02]And he's one of the greatest comedic writers of all time.
[313:47.20]That's not me.
[313:48.16]I'm not that guy.
[313:51.86]You want me to top Larry David by going and saying shpee and TF2 four years from now?
[313:58.39]Not gonna happen.
[314:06.44]Jerma getting canceled in four years.
[314:11.42]Thank you, though.
[314:13.42]Thank you, Scripsery, $5.
[314:16.27]Thank you to RedWalrus18 for the $10.
[314:19.79]Remove the two Bs.
[314:21.01]It's reminding me of sad things.
[314:22.85]That's pretty relevant for some reason.
[314:24.51]What does that mean?
[314:27.60]Remember, this is a donation from four hours ago.
[314:31.76]Remove the two bees.
[314:32.66]It's reminding me of sad things.
[314:34.88]Like bees are dying out, you need two bees to have sex with each other, to have another bee.
[314:41.43]So that, he's being, he's upset about this.
[314:47.39]That's some, that's some Time Portal 3 shit.
[314:51.79]But thank you, Red Wallers, for the 10 bucks.
[314:53.87]Appreciate it.
[314:55.31]Dearly beloved, thanks for the $1.
[314:56.31]RIP $1,600 worth of frogs.
[315:00.87]Yeah, you're right.
[315:01.41]I did not.
[315:01.86]I know what he's talking about.
[315:04.14]I know exactly what he's talking about.
[315:06.82]I wasted a bunch of money on frogs.
[315:09.00]Oh, well.
[315:10.22]Fuck it.
[315:11.64]Whoops.
[315:14.18]Errorless, thank you for the $1.
[315:15.35]Here's a link to that New York Times article.
[315:17.03]I don't want to read an article about dabbing.
[315:19.07]I don't want to... You tell me.
[315:22.19]You want me to sit here and read an article about dabbing.
[315:28.23]No, I'm not going to read a New York Times dab article.
[315:32.01]Because I'll probably throw up.
[315:35.25]Thank you for the $1 airless, though.
[315:36.45]Appreciate it.
[315:37.17]Sergeant Jetstream, thanks for the $3.
[315:40.47]They just say, Emily stinks.
[315:42.73]I don't know if Emily's currently watching the stream with you.
[315:45.60]But I'm... Maybe she has... I'm sure she smells fine.
[315:51.04]Thank you Smokewise Ganja for the $3.
[315:53.82]Dare you $3 to burp on stream.
[315:55.70]Already did.

[320:41.08]Looking forward to it.
[320:41.95]Can't wait to have a full head of fucking hair.
[320:44.09]I already do have a full head of hair.
[320:47.09]There are people that probably are just seeing this stream for the first time, and I can't turn my webcam on.
[320:51.91]So they think I'm a bald fuck, and I'm not.
[320:54.66]But I can't prove it because I don't have any clothes on.
[320:57.26]So I can't turn on webcam to prove it, which also to that person means, bullshit, you just don't want me to see your bald fucking head.
[321:05.34]And you being naked is the reason why you're not going to turn the fucking webcam on.
[321:09.61]But the problem here is that that's actually true.
[321:11.69]I don't have any clothes on, so I can't do it.
[321:16.49]So, sorry, if you're new here, I'm not.
[321:20.35]Click at the fucking Inger link of the New York Times or the front page of the New York Times article.
[321:23.31]I have the full head of hair.

[321:40.34]I'll tell your friends that you are you because if you turned into me and I would be you, I'd be there.
[321:46.89]And I would say that for the second thing, get a couple of Kleenexes and some baby wipes and take care of it.
[321:55.26]Maybe throw your underwear in the trash.
[321:57.14]I've done that before.
[321:57.76]You know, you shit your pants and you throw your underwear in the trash.

[324:14.34]Why?
[324:14.60]Why?
[324:14.84]Why?

[324:32.20]You're telling me that potatoes cooked in fat cures baldness.
[324:38.76]Who, why?
[324:42.10]What's in them?
[324:43.38]It's starch, oil, and fucking potatoes.
[324:46.02]How does that cure baldness?
[324:52.81]How did they even figure this out?
[324:54.34]What, did some bald-ass guy start eating McDonald's every day like Morgan Spurlock?
[325:00.86]And all of a sudden, he just was eating a fucking large fry every day and he grew a full head of Rockstar hair?
[325:07.61]How did this happen?
[325:13.40]And he's like, holy shit.
[325:15.41]When did I get hair this long?
[325:16.79]He's got like a animal from the Muppets hair and he just didn't even realize it.
[325:20.47]He was eating.
[325:21.19]They even fucking opened him up when he was still alive and dug in there and found out what was in there.
[325:25.99]They tested it on mice.
[325:27.35]Why are they feeding mice McDonald's fries?
[325:30.95]Who's the fucked up scientist that's like, you know what we're going to do today?
[325:33.69]Just for no reason.
[325:34.75]Let's just feed rats fries every day and fuck them up real good.
[325:39.82]Oops, I accidentally found the cure for baldness.
[325:44.02]Fucking scientists.

[328:53.44]And she takes a huge sip from a giant can.
[328:56.49]Nobody drinks that much in one... Especially... You know what else I think is really stupid?
[329:00.51]Let's talk about more advertising stuff for a minute here.
[329:03.01]When they show, like... When they show, like, a tiny, tiny person.
[329:07.41]Like a Burger King ad or like a McDonald's ad or something.
[329:10.55]I remember Carl's Jr.
[329:11.57]did this a long time ago.
[329:13.09]They got these, like, quadruple quarter pounders that this hundred pound girl is eating.
[329:19.15]And she's like, Mmm, yeah, I'm gonna eat this whole fucking thing.
[329:22.22]What?
[329:22.48]What?
[329:24.57]Like, I can't eat a, like, quadruple quarter pounder.
[329:28.42]I can't do it.
[329:29.78]Why do you have people on camera, like, drinking these, like, large sodas that they're not, they're never gonna fucking actually finish?
[329:35.93]I can't even finish that.
[329:40.61]Those old burger commercials.
[329:41.67]Yeah, they showed people eating like huge amounts of food.
[329:44.75]There's a guy that's sitting there like, oh yeah, like I'm super, super attractive and incredibly healthy and I'm fit like a goddamn ox.
[329:51.66]But you know what I like to eat?
[329:52.64]I eat like fucking four quarter pounders.
[329:54.72]No, you don't.
[329:55.80]You do not do that.
[329:56.70]You do not eat that.
[329:58.85]They need to have a realistic commercial with a guy with a huge fucking scraggly beard and like dirty hair.
[330:05.18]And, like, a little bit overweight eating in those commercials.
[330:08.00]And maybe, like, a dusty, like, dirty guy.
[330:10.64]Like, I could play that.
[330:11.66]Like, have, like, dirty hair.
[330:12.99]Like, I'm not saying that everybody that eats at Burger King has dirty hair.
[330:15.97]But a lot of people that eat at Burger King have dirty fucking hair, right?
[330:19.49]Like, I have dirty hair sometimes.
[330:24.12]They have a spit bucket during the shoot.
[330:32.41]Fat.
[330:33.17]No, you don't have to be fat.
[330:34.21]I'm just saying they put these like unrealistic people in these commercials.
[330:37.69]I can tell you that like a supermodel is absolutely not slamming Pepsi.
[330:43.27]Like a supermodel is not downing like drowning fucking cokes.
[330:47.78]It's not gonna happen.
[330:52.52]Fast pata- D'oh!

[333:15.29]I don't want to have to put the clamp, the clasp of justice on you guys again.
[333:20.37]Behave.
[333:25.22]Hey, Abomination0, thank you for the $1.05, SenatorMegaMan, please filibuster the chat, we're being bad boys.
[333:33.71]Yeah, I did.
[333:39.57]Stream over screen is inaccurate, Earth is still there.
[333:41.75]Earth is still, he's just on vacation.
[333:44.79]He's just currently not on your computer right now.
[333:48.09]Give him a rest, he's been used so many times.
[333:49.69]The jermaEarth has been used like 28,000 times.
[333:55.70]more than any other planet, so give him a break.
[333:57.94]He needs his rest.
[334:00.74]Uh, thank you, though.
[334:01.44]Thank you to MooMeansMoo again.
[334:02.46]MooMeansMoo again!
[334:04.30]Two more times here.
[334:06.12]Thank you, dude.
[334:07.30]Jerma struggled against the weight that was pushing against his door.
[334:10.56]I can't keep this up for much longer, he yelled to his mods, that were helping to hold the anti-chat protection at bay.
[334:17.47]As PJ salts were starting to pour between the cracks, forming in the only thing to keep chat from flooding the compound,
[334:23.50]It's no use, release them, said Jerma, resigned to his fate.
[334:28.74]Why did I just play that out like an act, like an actor?
[334:32.94]His mods protested at first, but eventually eased up and the compound was breached.
[334:37.20]A flood of owl faces poured through the door, smothering the poor screamer and his loyal mods in a mob of fury, rage.
[334:44.37]His last words were, I just wanted new jokes.
[334:51.21]Thank you.
[334:52.31]Thank you.

[335:23.47]And I'm making you disappear.
[335:24.89]And you just have to do the equivalent of changing your clothes to come back.

[339:23.09]That was the part of the bit we were doing there.
[339:26.00]I did the classic.
[339:28.10]Talk about how good of a person you are and immediately do something bad.
[339:31.43]I could have had a laugh track there for how scripted and calculated that was.
[339:43.59]If Mega Man Minx, if Manga, what are you saying?
[339:48.30]If Manga Minx contacted you and asked if you wanted to be on her next Friday show, would I accept?
